Abstract

It is shown that the Dirac-nambu-Goto brane can be described as a point particle
in an inﬁnite dimensional brane space with a particular metric. This suggests a
generalization to brane spaces with arbitrary metric, including the “ﬂat” metric.
Then quantization of such a system is straightforward: it is just like quantization of
a bunch of non interacting particles. This leads us to a system of a continuous set of
scalar ﬁelds. For a particular choice of the metric in the space of ﬁelds we ﬁnd that
the classical Dirac-Nambu-Goto brane theory arises as an eﬀective theory of such an
underlying quantum ﬁeld theory. Quantization of branes is important for the brane
world scenarios, and thus for “quantum gravity”.

Introduction

Quantization of the Dirac-Nambu-Goto p-brane [1, 2] is a tough problem that still
awaits for a solution. The problem is rather well understood an resolved in the case
of strings (p = 1) [3], but not of branes of arbitrary dimensionality p. Branes, p-
branes and D-branes [4] are important objects in string theory. Since according to
the brane world scenarios [5, 6, 7] a 3-brane sweeping a 4-dimensional world sheet can
be associated with our spacetime, quantization of the brane would as well resolve the
problem of quantum gravity.

In this paper I will show that the Dirac-Nambu-Goto action, governing the dy-
namics of p-branes, is a special case of an action in an inﬁnite dimensional space M,
for a special choice of the metric. This suggests that the usual string or p-brane the-
ory is embedded in a more general theory in which the metric of M is arbitrary [6]
in the same sense as is arbitrary the metric of spacetime in general relativity.
In
particular, the metric of M can be globally diagonal, in which case we have very
special objects that I will call “ﬂat branes”. A ﬂat brane is like a bunch of point
particles in the absence of any interaction. If we bring an interaction into the game,
then the metric of M is no longer globally diagonal, i.e., ﬂat, and the space M has
non vanishing curvature.

If such a generalized brane is compared with a bunch of interacting particles, then
by analogy, the generic metric of the particle conﬁguration space C should be like the

1

generic metric of the brane space M. Such a reasoning suggests that the usual many
particle interacting theory and its quantization should be generalized so that in the
limit of continuous bunch of particles it would match the theory of general branes
and the curved brane space M. In the case of ﬂat brane space M and ﬂat particle
conﬁguration space C, the generalized brane theory that allows for the diagonal metric
of M, matches the usual theory of non interacting point particles, where the metric
of C is also diagonal.

Quantized theory of a generalized brane should thus start just as the quantization
of many particle systems:
in ﬂat brane space M. By analogy, quantized theory
of an interacting many particle system should be formulated not in 4-dimensional
spacetime, but in the many dimensional conﬁguration space C. The corresponding
quantum ﬁelds are then functions of position in C. As a model we consider the
theory of a scalar ﬁeld in a multidimensional conﬁguration space. The action for such
a system can be reduced to the action for a system of scalar ﬁelds describing non
interacting distinguishable particles. In the continuum limit we have a bunch of non
interacting particles forming a ﬂat brane. Such a bunch of particles—a ﬂat brane—is
described by a continuous set of scalar ﬁelds, diﬀering in the brane parameters σ¯a,
¯a = 1, 2, ..., p, the metric s(σ, σ′) of the ﬁeld space being diagonal (δ-function like).
If we replace the diagonal metric with a more general one, then we have interactions
amongst the brane constituent “particles”.

We have found a particular metric s(σ, σ′) = (1 + λ∂¯a∂¯a)δp(σ − σ′) which enables
straightforward exact calculations and quantization. The inverse of such a metric
is the propagator in the space {σ¯a}. The theory becomes a theory of the scalar
ﬁeld ϕ(σ¯a, xµ) whose arguments are not only spacetime coordinates xµ, but also the
brane coordinates σ¯a. It is straightforward to compute the exact Hamiltonian and
momentum operator ˆp. We then calculated how the expectation value of ˆp in a state
which is the product of single particle wave packet proﬁles changes with time. We
obtained the equations of motion for the wave packet centroid coordinates ¯X¯µ(σ) that
match the classical brane equations of motion in the case when the determinant (−¯γ)
of the brane’s induced metric γ¯a¯b is equal to 1. If we generalize the ﬁeld space metric
according to s(σ, σ′) = (cid:16)1 + λ∂¯a(√−¯γγ ¯a¯b∂¯b)(cid:17) δp(σ − σ′), then as the expectation

value we obtain exactly the classical brane equations of motion. The classical brane
theory is thus obtained as an eﬀective theory of our underlying quantum ﬁeld theory
of a continuous system of scalar ﬁelds for a particular choice of the ﬁeld space metric
s(σ, σ′). For a diﬀerent choice of s(σ, σ′) we would obtain a diﬀerent eﬀective classical
brane—in agreement with our starting assumption that the brane space of a classical
brane can have in principle an arbitrary metric, not necessarily the metric that gives
the Dirac-Nambu-Goto brane.

2 A brane as a “point particle” in an inﬁnite di-

mensional space

The Dirac-Nambu-Goto action for a p-brane is

I = κZ dp+1ξ (−γ)1/2,

(1)

Here γ ≡ det γab, γab ≡ ∂aX µ∂bXµ, where X µ(ξa), µ = 0, 1, 2, ..., D − 1, a =
0, 1, 2, ..., p, are the embedding functions of the world volume swept by the p-brane,
and κ is the brane tension.

A action that is equivalent to (1) is the Schild action [8]

ISchild =

κ

2kZ dp+1ξ (−γ),

(2)

in which the determinant of the induced metric occurs without the square root. This
is a gauge ﬁxed action. The equations of motion give ∂a(−γ) = 0, which means that
(−γ) = C, where C is a constant. If we choose a gauge so that

(−γ) = C = k2

c = κ√−γ ∂cXµ derived from the Dirac-Nambu-Goto action
then the momentum πµ
(1) is equal to the momentum κ(−γ)∂cXµ/k derived from the Schild action. This is
the reason why in (2) we included an additional constant factor 1/(2k).
The action (1) is invariant under reparametrizations of the parameters ξa ≡
(τ, σ¯a), ¯a = 1, 2, ..., p. We can choose a particular gauge (choice of ξa) in which
the determinant factorizes according to

(3)

(5)

where ˙X 2 ≡ ˙X µ ˙Xµ,
action (1) then becomes

(−γ) = ˙X 2(−¯γ),

(4)
˙X µ ≡ ∂X µ/∂τ , and ¯γ ≡ det ∂¯aX µ∂¯bXµ, ¯a, ¯b = 1, 2, ..., p. The

I = κZ dτ dpσp ˙X 2√−¯γ.

The Schild action (2) is invariant under those coordinate transformations of ξa
which preserve the determinant γ. Also for the Schild action we can choose a gauge
in which holds the factorization (4). Then Eq. (2) becomes

ISchild =

κ

2kZ dτ dpσ ˙X 2(−¯γ)

This can be written as

I =

κ

2kZ dτ dpσ dpσ′ (−¯γ) ηµν δ(σ − σ′) ˙X µ(τ, σ) ˙X ν(τ, σ′).

At every τ , the integrand is a quadratic form in an inﬁnite dimensional space with
the metric

Introducing the compact notation

ρµν(σ, σ′) = (−¯γ) ηµν δ(σ − σ′).

˙X µ(σ)(τ ) ≡ ˙X µ(τ, σ) ,

ρµ(σ)ν(σ) ≡ ρµν(σ, σ′),

the action (7) reads1

ISchild =

κ

2kZ dτ ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ ) ˙X µ(σ)(τ ) ˙X ν(σ′)(τ ).

The momentum derived from the action (6) is

pµ(σ) =

which follows from (3) and (4).

k =p ˙X 2√−¯γ,

(12)

For the momentum belonging to the action (10) we obtain the expression which

equals to (11):

pµ(σ) =

ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ ) ˙X ν(σ′) =

κ

˙Xµ(σ) =

where ˙Xµ(σ) = ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ ) ˙X ν(σ′), and ˙Xµ(σ) = ηµν ˙X ν,
pµ(σ) ≡ pµ(σ), where

κ
(−¯γ) ˙Xµ(σ),
k
˙X µ(σ) ≡ ˙X µ(σ). We identify

(13)

pµ(σ) = ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ )pν(σ′) =

,

(14)

pµ(σ)
(−¯γ)

where pµ(σ) = ηµνpν(σ).

From the deﬁnition (11) of the momentum we obtain the following constraint:

We also have

pµ(σ)pµ(σ) = ηµνpµ(σ)pν(σ) = κ2(−¯γ).

pµ(σ)pµ(σ) = ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ )pµ(σ)pν(σ′) = ˜κ2,

(15)

(16)

1 We use the generalization of Einstein’s summation convention, so that not only summation
over the repeated indices µ, ν, but also the integration over the repeated continuous indices (σ), (σ′)
is assumed.

where

˜κ2 =Z κ2 dσ.

In deriving Eq. (16) we wrote pµ(σ)pµ(σ) = ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ )pµ(σ)pν(σ′), where ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ ) =
ηµνδ(σ − σ′)/(−¯γ), and used (15).

Eq. (10) can then be written in the form

ISchild =

˜κ

2˜kZ dτ ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ ) ˙X µ(σ)(τ ) ˙X ν(σ′)(τ ),

where

˜k2 = ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ ) ˙X µ(σ) ˙X ν(σ′) =Z dσ(−¯γ) ˙X µ ˙X ν =Z k2dσ.

Eq. (18) is a generalization to inﬁnite dimensions of the Schild action

ISchild =

m

2k Z dτ gµν ˙X µ ˙X ν

for a relativistic point particle in a curved spacetime with the metric gµν. The latter
action is a gauge ﬁxed action for a relativistic point particle, which is described by
the reparametrization invariant action

I = mZ dτ (gµν ˙X µ ˙X ν)1/2.

Analogously, instead of (18), we can take the action

I = ˜κZ dτ(cid:16)ρµ(σ)ν(σ) ˙X µ(σ)(τ ) ˙X ν(σ′)(τ )(cid:17)1/2

.

From (17) and (19) it follows that ˜κ/˜k = k/κ, i.e.,

(22)

(23)

˜κ

q ˙X µ(σ) ˙Xµ(σ)

q(−¯γ) ˙X µ ˙Xµ

This relation is valid not only in the gauge in which p ˙X 2√−¯γ = k = constant, but

also in an arbitrary gauge. The same is true for the constraints (15) and (16).

Similarly to a point particle being described at every τ by a ﬁnite set of coordinates
xµ of a point (event) in a ﬁnite dimensional spacetime, a brane is described at every
τ by an inﬁnite set of coordinates xµ(σ) ≡ xµ(σ) of a point in an inﬁnite dimensional
space, the so called brane space M [6, 9]. As τ monotonically increases, the brane
traces a worldline in M, described by the parametric equation xµ(σ) = X µ(σ)(τ ),
which is a mapping from the 1-dimensional space of the parameter τ into an inﬁnite

5

dimensional brane space M whose points are denoted by an inﬁnite set of coordi-
nates xµ(σ). The latter coordinates describe a brane event in an analogous way as the
coordinates xµ, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 described a point particle event in spacetime. The dis-
tinction between the lower case xµ(σ) and the capital X µ(σ) is the distinction between
coordinates of the brane space M and τ -dependent functions X µ(σ) ≡ X µ(σ)(τ ). The
derivative ˙X µ(σ)(τ ) is the velocity in M.
Here xµ(σ) ≡ xµ(σ) denotes a kinematically possible brane. We postulate that
distinct functions xµ(σ) can describe physically diﬀerent branes, even in the case in
which they are related to each other by a diﬀeomorphism σi → σ′¯a = f ¯a(σ). In such
a case, a diﬀeomorphism is active: it transforms one brane into another brane that
is physically diﬀerent in the sense that its points are tangentially displaced while the
mathematical surface of both branes are the same2. On the other hand, a passive
diﬀeomorhism only relables the parameters σ¯a into new parameters σ′¯a, whereas the
brane remains the same.

Consideration of the branes related by active diﬀeomorphisms as distinct kinemat-
ically possible objects is a crucial step that enables a formulation of the generalized
brane theory. Then the tensor calculus of general relativity can be straightforwardly
generalized to inﬁnite dimensions. A point particle event with coordinates xµ is
analogous to a brane event with coordinates xµ(σ). A diﬀeomorphism in spacetime,

is analogous to a diﬀeomorphism

xµ → x′µ = f µ(xν),

xµ(σ) → x′µ(σ) = F µ(σ)(xν(σ)),

i.e.,

(24)

(25)

xµ(σ) → x′µ(σ) = F µ(σ)[xν(σ)],

(26)
where F µ(σ)[xν(σ)] are functionals of xν(σ). The new M-space coordinates x′µ(σ) are
functions of the old M-space coordinates xµ(σ), i.e., the embedding functions x′µ(σ)
are functionals of the old embedding functions xµ(σ). Both those diﬀeomorphisms
can be either passive or active. If interpreted passively, then Eq. (25) means that the
same brane is described either by M-space coordinates3 xµ(σ) or x′µ(σ).
brane as well:

Diﬀeomorphisms in the brane space M include the diﬀeomorphisms within the

σ¯a → σ′¯a = f ¯a(σ),

⇒ xµ(σ) → xµ(f (σ)) = x′µ(σ′).

(27)

(28)

3 Notice that the prime does not mean a derivative, but new quantities.

6

In the latter expression we can rename σ′ into σ and write x′µ(σ) instead of X′µ(σ′).
Eq. (28) means that the brane space coordinates xµ(σ) transform into new brane space
coordinates x′µ(σ). Those new coordinates can be interpreted in the passive sense,
namely that they describe the same brane, or in the active sense, namely that they
describe a diﬀerent, i.e., tangentially deformed, brane.

Tensor calculus in brane space M is analogous to that in spacetime. For instance,

under a diﬀeomorphism (25) the velocity and the metric transform as

˙X′µ(σ) =

∂x′µ(σ)
∂xν(σ′ )

˙X ν(σ′),

∂xβ(σ′′′ )
∂xν(σ′ ) ρα(σ′′)β(σ′′′ ).
Here we use the following notation for functional derivatives:

∂xα(σ′′ )
∂xµ(σ)

ρ′µ(σ)ν(σ′ ) =

∂µ(σ) ≡

∂

∂xµ(σ) ≡

.

(29)

(30)

(31)

In general, the metric of M need not be of the form (8). Moreover, it can be a
metric that is not equivalent to (8) via a diﬀeomorphism in M; it can be a completely
diﬀerent metric. In Refs. [6, 9] it was proposed that the metric of M is dynamical
like the metric of spacetime in general relativity.

.

This can be written as I = ˜κR dτ L[ ˙X µ(σ), X µ(σ)], where the Lagrangian

L[ ˙X µ(σ), X µ(σ)] =(cid:18)Z dpσ (−¯γ) ˙X 2(cid:19)1/2

This is the same equation as that derived from the Dirac-Nambu-Goto action (5).
We have thus veriﬁed that the action (35), which is just (22) for a particular metric
(8), gives the same equations of motion as the action (5). The form of the action
(22) suggests that in general the metric can be arbitrary, either a “curved” or a “ﬂat”
metric, including the brane space analog of the metric ηµν

3 Flat brane space: a brane as a bunch of non

interacting point particles

The reasoning at the end of the last section suggests that we should start formulating
the brane theory with the most simple metric, i.e.,

ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ ) = ηµ(σ)ν(σ′ ) = ηµνδ(σ − σ′),

(40)

which is the metric of ﬂat brane space M. With such a metric the action (22) becomes

I = ˜κZ dτ (cid:18)Z dp σ ηµν ˙X µ(τ, σ) ˙X ν(τ, σ)(cid:19)1/2

.

(41)

This is an action for a brane in ﬂat background space M. Such a brane we will call
ﬂat brane. The action (41) is not invariant under general coordinate transformations
(25) in M-space. Under a diﬀeomorphism (25) the metric (40) occurring in the latter
action transforms according to (30) into a new metric. A diﬀeomorphism (28) is just
a particular diﬀeomorphism in M-space, and the action (22) is invariant under (28),
and of the same form. This shows that we need not to worry that (41) does not
contain a square root of the determinant of the metric in the σ¯a space, because the
action (41) is a particular case of the action (22) in which the metric is ﬁxed according
to (40), and which is invariant and covariant from the M-space point of view.

(43)

(44)

This is a bunch of straight worldlines. In other words, Eq. (44) represents a continuum
limit of a system of non-interacting point particles, tracing straight worldlines.

Quantization of the system described by the action (41) can be performed in
analogous way as the quantization of the point particle in ﬂat spacetime. Eq. (41)
implies the constraint

A particular solution is

φ = eipµ(σ)xµ(σ)

where the momentum eigenvalue pµ(σ) satisﬁes the constraint (45).

A general solution of Eq. (51) is

φ(xµ(σ)) =Z Dp c(p) eipµ(σ)xµ(σ)

δ(pµ(σ)pµ(σ) − ˜κ2).

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

Upon second quantization, φ(xµ(σ)) becomes the operator that creates or anni-
hilates a brane with coordinates xµ(σ) ≡ xµ(σ). Because we consider the ﬂat brane
space with the metric (40), a brane with coordinates xµ(σ) is in fact a bunch of non
interacting point particles, i.e., a continuous limit of a many particle system.

The coeﬃcients c(p) ≡ c(pµ(σ)) determine the proﬁle of the wave packet. Let us

consider the case in which

c(pµ(σ)) = c(pµ(σ))|σ∈(0,∆σ)δ(pµ(σ) − p0µ(σ))|σ∈(∆σ,L)

(55)

This means that the brane momentum in the interval from σ = 0 to σ = ∆σ is
undetermined, whereas in the interval σ ∈ (∆σ, L) is sharply determined, so that it
is equal to p0µ(σ).

If we insert (55) into the general solution (54), we obtain

The δ-function constraint in Eq. (56) can be written as

Z ∆σ

0

(pµ(σ)pµ(σ) − κ2)dσ ≈ (pµ(σ)pµ(σ) − κ2)∆σ = 0.

(60)

(61)

Multiplying the latter expression by ∆σ and introducing pµ = pµ(σ)∆σ, κ∆σ = m,
we obtain

pµpµ − m2 = 0,

(62)

which is the constraint among the point particle momenta.

Not only in the generalized, but also in the restricted Klein-Gordon equation
(60), the momentum operator is the functional derivative (48). By proceeding in the
analogous was as in Eqs. (61),(62), we obtain

(ˆpµ ˆpµ − m2)ϕ(xµ) = 0,

(63)

where ˆpµ(σ0)∆σ = ˆpµ = −i∂/∂xµ(σ0) is the partial derivative with respect to the
brane coordinates at σ = σ0 = 0, and ϕ(xµ) = φ(xµ(σ))|σ0.
In our setup, the segment of the brane around σ = σ0(= 0) behaves as a point
particle and satisﬁes the point-particle Klein-Gordon equation. The remaining seg-
ment of the brane from σ = ∆σ to σ = L, has deﬁnite momentum pµ(σ) = p0µ(σ),
and contributes only a phase factor (57).
If p0µ(σ) = 0, this means that actually
there is no brane outside the range σ ∈ (0, ∆σ). Then we have only the brane within
σ ∈ (0, ∆σ), which in the limit ∆σ → 0 behaves as a point particle. For ﬁnite, but

11

small ∆σ, the brane behaves approximately as a point particle. At the end of Section
4 we further illuminate the derivation of (63) from (50).

The action for the ﬁeld ϕ(xµ), satisfying the Klein-Gordon equation (63) is

I[ϕ(xµ)] =

1

2Z dDx (∂µϕ∂µϕ − m2ϕ2).

(64)

The latter action can also be straightforwardly derived from the action (50) by taking
the ansatz

φ(xµ(σ)) = eR L

∆σ p0µ(σ)xµ(σ)dσϕ(xµ),

(65)

and using (58).

In the following we will describe the ﬂat brane by means of many particle non
interacting ﬁeld theory. Diﬀerent segments of the brane behave as distinguishable
particles, each being described by a diﬀerent scalar ﬁeld ϕr(x). The action for a
system of those scalar ﬁelds is

[Πr(t, x), Π + s(t, x′] = 0.

(71)
We have absorbed the usual factor (2π) ¯D 2ωk, where ωk = √m2 + k2, into the deﬁni-
tion of operators a†r(k), a†r(k). The latter operators create and annihilate a particle
with the momentum k.

[a†r(k), a†s(k′)] = 0.

(74)
The operator ar(x) annihilates the vacuum |0i, whereas a†r(x) creates a particle at
position x:

[a†r(x), a†s(x′)] = 0.

(73)

(75)

a†r(x)|0i = |xi.

In Appendix A we examine in more detail the properties of the operators ar(x), a†r(x)
and show that in a given Lorentz frame they can indeed be interpreted, respectively,
as a creation and annihillaton operators for a particle at the position x.

A succession of a†r(x)’s creates a manny particle state

a†1(x1)a†2(x2)...a†N (xN )|0i = |x1x2...xNi.

In a more compact notation this reads

where Xr denotes a conﬁguration of many particles, each having a diﬀerent position

be a brane:

The latter deﬁnition is equivalent to the usual deﬁnition of momentum operator, be-
cause the factor 1/((2π) ¯D 2ωp) has been absorbed into the deﬁnition of the operators
a†r(p) and ar(p).

Similarly, we can deﬁne the position operator,

ˆxr =Z d

¯Dx x a†r(x)ar(x) =Z d

(80)

Notice that the position operator so deﬁned is not equivalent to the usually deﬁned
“position operator” [10], which is then shown to be inappropriate, because it is not

13

self-adjoint with respect to the considered, i.e., Lorentz invariant, scalar product.
Our position operator (80) is Hermitian, because x†r = xr. It is also self-adjoint with
respect to the Lorentz non invariant4 scalar product between the wave packet states
created by a†r(x) or, equivalently, by a†r(p).

The commutator of those operators is

The wave function is symmetric with respect to the interchange of x1, x′1, x′′1, but has
no deﬁnite symmetry with respect to the interchange of xr and xr′. The state (86)

In Eq. (91), h ˆpr/ωrpi is the expectation value of a particle’s velocity. Thus the
expectation value of each particle’s center of mass position within our conﬁguration
traces a straight worldline. If particles are close to each other, such a conﬁguration
samples a ﬂat brane. In the continuous limit we have a ﬂat brane.

All equations (66)–(97) can be straightoforwardly generalized to a continuous set
of “particles”, if instead of the discrete index r we take a continuous parameter, more
precisely, a set of parameters σ ≡ σ¯a, ¯a = 1, 2, ..., p.

4 Towards curved brane space: A brane as a

bunch of interacting point particles

Let us now introduce an interaction between the particles described by the ﬁelds ϕr,
and generalize the action (66) according to

I[ϕi] =

1

2Z dDx (∂µϕr∂µϕs − m2ϕrϕs)srs.

(98)

The matrix srs has the rˆole of a metric in the space of ﬁelds.
In general, srs is a
functional of ϕr. If srs is not a functional of ϕr, if it can be diagonalized, and has the
inverse srs, then the action (98) brings nothing new in comparison with the action
(66). Interactions come into the game, if srs is a functional of ϕr, or if it cannot be
diagonalized.

In the continuum limit, the discrete index r becomes the continuous index (σ),
and ϕr becomes ϕ(σ). A discrete set of point particles, described by a discrete set of
scalar ﬁelds ϕr, r = 1, 2, ..., N, becomes a continuous set of point particle —a brane—
described by a continuous set of scalar ﬁelds ϕ(σ). The action (98) is then replaced
by

I[ϕ(σ)] =

1

2Z dDx (cid:16)∂µϕ(σ)∂µϕ(σ′

) − m2ϕσ)ϕ(σ′)(cid:17) s(σ)(σ′ ).

(99)

In general, s(σ)(σ′ ) is a functional of ϕ(σ), and it can thus give an interaction,
provided that the space of ﬁelds has nonvanishing curvature. We will restrict our
consideration to the case when s(σ),(σ′) does not depend on ϕ(σ). Then we can still

16

have an interacting system, if s(σ)(σ′ ) cannot be diagonalized to s(σ)(σ′ ) = δ(σ − σ′).
We will assume that s(σ)(σ′ ) has the inverse s(σ)(σ′ ), such that
(σ′) ≡ δ(σ − σ′).

s(σ)(σ′′ )s(σ′′)(σ′) = δ(σ)

(100)

The equation of motion is

∂µ∂µϕ(σ) + m2ϕ(σ) = 0,

where ϕ(σ) = s(σ)(σ′ )ϕ(σ′). Because of (100) we also have

∂µ∂µϕ(σ) + m2ϕ(σ) = 0,

(101)

(102)

The canonically conjugated variables ϕ(σ) and Π(σ) = ∂L/∂ ˙ϕ(σ) = ˙ϕ(σ) satisfy the

commutation relations

[ϕ(σ)(x), Π(σ′)(x′)](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x0=x′0

(104)

¯Dx (Π(σ) ˙ϕ(σ) − L) =

¯Dx (Πσ)Π(σ) − ∂iϕ(σ)∂iϕ(σ) + m2ϕ(σ)ϕ(σ)). (105)

[ϕ(σ)(x), ϕ(σ′)(x′)](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x0=x′0

The Hamiltonian is

H =Z d

A general solution of Eq. (101) can be expanded according to

ϕ(σ)(x) =Z

p(2π) ¯D2ωk (cid:16)a(σ)(k)e−ikx + a†(σ)(k)eikx(cid:17) ,

where ωk = √k2 + m2. Analogous expansion holds for ϕ(σ). Now we have the
following commutation relations:

(106)

[a(σ)(p), a†(σ′)(p′)] = δ(σ)

(σ′)δ ¯D(p − p′).
Because a(σ) = s(σ)(σ′ )a(σ′), and a(σ) = s(σ)(σ′ )a(σ′), we also have
[a(σ)(p), a†(σ′)(p′)] = s(σ)(σ′ )δ ¯D(p − p′).

and

[a(σ)(p), a†(σ′)(p′)] = s(σ)(σ′ )δ ¯D(p − p′).

Using (106) and (107), the Hamiltonian (105) becomes

H =

2Z d
=Z d

¯Dk ωk(cid:16)a†(σ)(k)a(σ)(k) + a(σ)(k)a†(σ)(k)(cid:17)
¯Dk ωk a†(σ)(k)a(σ)(k) + Hz.p.,

17

(107)

(108)

(109)

(110)

where Hz.p. is the ”zero point” Hamiltonian, and

a†(σ)(k)a(σ)(k) = a†(σ)(k)a(σ′)(k)s(σ)(σ′ ) = a†(σ)(k)a(σ′)(k)s(σ)(σ′ ).

(111)

For the momentum operator we obtain5

ˆp =

¯Dk k(cid:16)a†(σ)(k)a(σ)(k) + a(σ)(k)a†(σ)(k)(cid:17)
¯Dk k a†(σ)(k)a(σ)(k) + ˆpz.p..

(112)

We will now assume that in general m depends on position σ on the brane6. Then

also ωk = √m2 + k2 is function of σ. We thus have

H =Z dk ωk(σ)a†(σ)(k)a(σ′)(k)s(σ)(σ′ ) + Hz.p.,
H† =Z dk ωk(σ′)a†(σ)(k)a(σ′)(k)s(σ)(σ′ ) + Hz.p..

(113)

(114)

In the expression for H† we have renamed σ → σ′, σ′ → σ, and used s(σ′)(σ) = s(σ)(σ′ ).
The Hamilton operator so modiﬁed is not Hermitian. The momentum operator re-
mains unchanged and Hermitian.

Let us now calculate the time derivative of the expectation value of the momentum

operator ˆp. We obtain:

6 In the discrete case this corresponds to each particle having a diﬀerent mass mr (see Eqs. (66),

18

Therefore, Eq. (115) gives

d ˆp
dt

= (−i)( ˆpH − H† ˆp).

(118)

The latter expression is equal to (d ˆp/dt)†, therefore (d ˆp/dt) is Hermitian, as it should
be. The zero point Hamiltonian, Hz.p. = H†z.p., cancels out in Eq. (118).

As the ﬁrst step let us now consider the brane state which is the product of ”single

particle” wave packet proﬁles:

|ψi =Yσ Z d

¯Dpσ) g(σ)(p(σ))a†(σ)(p(σ))|0i

no integration over (σ). (119)

Acting on the latter state by an annihilation operator, we obtain

a(σ′)(p′(σ′))|ψi =Z dp(σ)dσ′δ(σ′ − σ)δ(p′(σ′) − p(σ))g(σ)(p(σ′))| ¯ψi = g(σ′)(p′(σ′)| ¯ψi,
(120)
where | ¯ψi is the product of all the single ”particle” states. except the one picked up
by a(σ′)(p′(σ′)):

| ¯ψi = Yσ6=σ′Z dp(σ)g(σ)(p(σ))a†(σ)(p(σ))! |0i.

(121)

We thus have

hψ|a†(σ′′)(p′′(σ′′))a(σ′)(p′(σ′))|ψi = g∗(σ′′)(p′′(σ′′))g(σ′)(p′(σ′))h ¯ψ| ¯ψi,

(122)

where normalization can be such that h ¯ψ| ¯ψi = 1.

Alternatively, if we take the state

where

|ψi =Z dp g(σ)(p)a(σ)(p)|0i,

g(σ)(p)a(σ)(p) = g(σ)(p)a†(σ′)(p)s(σ)(σ′),

and where now we have the integration over (σ), (σ′), then we obtain

a(σ′)(p′)|ψi = g(σ′)(p′)|0i,

and

hψ|a†(σ′′)(p′′)a(σ′)(p′)|ψi = g∗(σ′′)(p′′)g(σ′)(p′)h0|0i,

(123)

(124)

(125)

(126)

where h0|0i = 1.

Comparison of Eqs. (120),(122) with (125),(126) reveals us that instead of the
state (119) in which we have the product of the single ”particle” states, we can as

19

well take the state (123) in which we have a superposition of the single ”particles”
states over σ.

Inserting the state (119) into (115), we obtain

d

dthψ| ˆp|ψi = (−i)Z d

¯Dp p g∗(σ, p)g(σ′, p)s(σ, σ′)(ωp(σ) − ωp(σ′))dσdσ′,

where we now write g(σ)(p) ≡ g(σ, p), and s(σ)(σ′ ) ≡ s(σ, σ′).

Let us now choose

s(σ)(σ′ ) ≡ s(σ, σ′) = (1 + λ∂¯a∂¯a) δp(σ − σ′).

Then Eq. (127) gives

d
dthpi ≡

¯Dp dpσ p ωp(σ)(g∗∂¯a∂¯ag − ∂¯a∂¯ag∗g).

(129)

This is the time derivative of the expectation value of the total momentum operator
of the brane,

hψ| ˆp|ψi = Z dp dσ dσ′ p g∗(σ, p)g(σ′, p)s(σ, σ′)

= Z dp dσ p(g∗g + g∗∂¯a∂¯ag) = h ˆpi =Z dσh ˆpiσ

Here

is the state of the brane’s element at σ′ ≡ σ′¯a. This is the state (119) in which there
is no product over σ, or equivalently, the state (123), in which there is no integration
over σ.
In Eq. (131) we have thus the expectation value of the momentum of the
brane’s element at σ.

Omitting the integration over σ in Eq. (129), we obtain

d

dth ˆpiσ = (−i)λZ d

¯Dp p ωp(σ)(g∗∂¯a∂¯ag − ∂¯a∂¯ag∗g),

(133)

which is the time derivative of the expected momentum of a brane’s element, i.e., a
“particle” forming the brane.

In Eq. (133) we can take ωp that does not change with σ, and yet, in general, the

expression would not vanish. For constant ωp we obtain

d

dth ˆpiσ = (−i)λ∂¯aZ d

¯Dp p ωp(g∗∂¯ag − ∂¯ag∗g).

(134)

20

This is the continuity equation for a current density on the brane. Integrating the
latter equation over σ, we have (d/dt)h ˆpi = 0. This means that for a constant m,
and thus for constant ωp =pm2 + p2, the total momentum of the brane is constant
in time, as it should be for an isolated brane7. The momentum of a brane’s element
dσ at σ in general changes with time according to Eq. (134). With our model we have
thus reproduced the well known facts about the brane’s momentum. In the following
we will explore how the things look in the coordinate representation.

By taking the Fourier transform according to

brane, or a non ﬂat brane, described in a gauge in which −¯γ = 1. The correspondence
is approximate (rough), because in Eq. (139) ∂¯a is raised with δ¯a¯b, and not with ¯γ ¯a¯b.
In order to calculate the integral in Eq. (139) we need to know the wave func-
tion f (σ, x, t) which, in general depends on time, and must satisfy the Schr¨odinger
equation. Its exact solution for a minimal uncertainty wave packet has been found
in Ref. [14]. As a ﬁrst estimation let us take the unperturbed wave function, which
close to the initial time t = 0, is equal to

f ≈ Ae− (x− ¯X(σ))2

2˜σ0

ei ¯pxei¯p0t,

(141)

where ¯x(σ), ¯p, ¯p0 are, respectively, the coordinates, momentum and energy of the
wave packet center, and where A is the normalization constant. Because f satisﬁes
Eq. (137), in which the square root expands to inﬁnite order derivatives, at any t > 0,
the function f , even if localized at t = 0, becomes delocalized. But as it follows from
Ref. [14], the deviation from the Gaussian wave packet, such as (141), is relatively
small close to the initial time t = 0.

So we have

, whereas ¯p0

S ∂¯a ¯X¯µ corresponds to κp ˙X 2∂¯aX¯µ = p0(σ) ˙X 2∂¯aX¯µ.

Let us compare the latter equations with the brane equation of motion (39) in
which we take (−¯γ) = 1. The expectation value hˆp¯µiσ ≡ hpiσ corresponds to p¯µ(σ) =
κ ˙X ¯µ√ ˙X 2
In the gauge
τ = t ≡ X 0, the latter expression becomes p0(σ)(1− v2)∂¯aX¯µ ≈ p0(σ)∂¯aX¯µ, if v2 ≈ 0.
We have thus found that the centroid coordinates ¯X¯µ(σ) satisfy the equations of
motion of a brane with (−¯γ) = 1 and v2 ≈ 0, up to the factor λ/σ0. It is fascinating
that such result comes from the ﬁeld theory of a continuum of points particles, in
which the interaction is given in terms of the metric (129) acting in the space of
ﬁelds φ(σ)(t, x), and the wave packet proﬁle being approximated with the expression
(141) taken near t = 0. Therefore Eq. (149) is valid only near the initial time. For a
diﬀerent quantum state we would obtain an equation of motion for the expectation
values that would diﬀer from (149).

We can also consider the possibility of introducing a more general interaction than

(129). First we observe that Eq. (136) can be written in the form

d

dth ˆpiσ = −Z d

¯Dx(−i) [f∗(σ, x)(∂t∇f (σ′, x)) − (∂t∇f∗(σ, x))f ] λ(σ, σ′)

where

λ(σ, σ′) ≡ λ(σ)(σ′ ) = λ ∂¯a∂¯aδ(σ − σ′).
If we generalize the interaction metric λ(σ, σ′) according to

(150)

(151)

(152)

λ(σ, σ′) = λ ∂′¯a(cid:16)p−¯γ(σ′)∂¯a(cid:17) δ(σ − σ′),

where ¯γ = detγ¯a¯b is the determinant of the metric γ¯a¯b in the space of parameters
σ ≡ σ¯a, and ∂¯a = γ ¯a¯b∂¯b, then we obtain

d

dth ˆpiσ = −λ∂¯aZ d

¯Dx√−¯γ (−i) [f∗(∂t∂¯a∇f ) − (∂t∂¯a∇f∗)f ]

(153)

The latter equation corresponds to the brane equation of motion with non trivial
−¯γ 6= 1, i.e., to the equation of motion of the Dirac-Nambu-Goto brane, provided that
γ¯a¯b is equated with the induced metric on the brane’s worldsheet, γ¯a¯b = ∂¯aX µ∂bbX µ.
Taking the appropriate wave packet (141) and performing the calculations as in

(142)–(148) we obtain

hˆp¯µiσ

(154)

This is indeed very close to the brane equation (38) or (39), apart from the factor
˙X 2 = 1 − v2.
In our equation (154) we have ˙X 2 = 1, which means that v2 = 0.
Since Eq. (154) has been calculated for the wave packet at t ≈ 0, this is consistent

23

with vanishing hˆp¯µi ∝ ˙¯X¯µ at t ≈ 0. Because by our assumption ¯γ¯a¯b is the metric in
the space of parameters σ ≡ σ¯a, a = 1, 2, ..., p, and because ¯X ¯µ(σ) describe a brane
whose induced metric is ∂¯aX ¯µ∂¯bX¯µ, we conclude that ¯γ¯a¯b = ∂¯aX ¯µ∂¯bX¯µ.
Let us now investigate what happens if we use the metric (128) in the classical

action (22) by setting

ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ ) = ηµνs(σ)(σ′ ) = ηµν(1 + ∂¯a∂¯a) δ(σ − σ′)

(155)

Because the latter metric does not functionally depend on X α(σ), the second term in
the equation of motion (32) vanishes. Therefore the equation of motion is

pµ(σ) = 0,

where

pµ(σ) = ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ )pν(σ′) =

(161)

where in the last step we have used Eq. (23) with (−¯γ) = 1.

We see that our metric (155) modiﬁes the momentum so that it contains an extra
term, but otherwise the equation of motion is merely the derivative of momentum
(156), with no brane-like “force” term of the form similar to the second term in
Eq. (39).

For a generic metric, the constraints (16), associated with the action (22) leads

to the ﬁeld theory based on the action

If we take the metric

(163)
where s(σ)(σ′ ) is the inverse of s(σ)(σ′ ) = (1 + λ∂¯a∂¯a)δ(σ − σ′), we arrive at the action

(164)

This is just the action (99) considered at the beginning of this section, by postulating
the interaction metric s(σ)(σ) between the continuous set of scalar ﬁelds ϕ(σ)(x), whose
quantized theory leads to the expectation value equations of motion (149), which
contain the brane-like force term that is missing in the classical equations of motion
(156) for the metric ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ ) = ηµνs(σ)(σ′ ). The important point is that in the classical
theory with the relatively simple metric (155) we have the simple equations of motion
(156), whereas in the quantized theory with the same metric we also obtain the
“force” term in the eﬀective equations of motion (149) or (154). The expectation
value equations of motion describe the centroid brane whose brane space metric is no
longer (155), but a more general eﬀective metric.

We will now show that to Eq. (149) corresponds the metric

ρµ(σ)ν(σ′ ) = ∂¯aX ¯µ∂¯aX¯µδ(σ − σ′).

If we insert this metric into (22), we obtain the following equations of motion:

v2 = 0.
Similarly, the expectation value equation of motion (154) can be derived from the

Recall that ¯γ¯a¯b is the metric in the space of parameter σ¯a. On the other hand,
X ¯ν(τ, σ¯a) describes a brane. Therefore it makes sense to equate ¯γ¯a¯b with the induced
metric on the brane:

¯γ¯a¯b = ∂¯aX ¯ν∂¯bX¯ν.

(178)

Let us now take into account that the trace of the metric is equal to the dimension
of the brane:

∂¯bX ¯ν∂

¯bX¯ν = p.

Inserting this into (177) we ﬁnd that p cancels out, and Eq. (177) becomes

pressing it in terms of momenta, it can be written in the form

dτ

(181)

In the gauge τ = X 0 ≡ t, we ﬁnd that for v2 = 0 the latter equation corresponds to
the expectation value equation of motion (154).

5 Further clariﬁcation of the action for a continu-

ous set of interacting ﬁelds

We will now rewrite the action (99) into a more familiar form. Let us write ϕ(σ)(x) ≡
ϕ(σ, x), and take the metric (128). Then, after performing partial integration over
σ¯a and omitting the surface term, we obtain

I =

1

2Z dDx dpσ(cid:2)∂µϕ∂µϕ − m2ϕ2 + λ(∂µ∂¯aϕ∂µ∂¯aϕ − m2∂¯aϕ∂¯aϕ)(cid:3) .

Variation with respect to ϕ(σ, x) gives the ﬁeld equation

A particular solution is

subjected to the condition

(∂µ∂µ + m2)(1 + λ∂¯a∂¯a)ϕ − 0.

ϕ = e−iπ¯aσ¯a

.e−ipµxµ

,

(pµpµ − m2)(1 − λπ¯aπ¯a) = 0.

27

(182)

(183)

(184)

(185)

We can take π¯a arbitrary, whereas pµ satisfying the mass shell constraint pµpµ−m2 = 0
(Case A), or vice versa, pµ arbitrary and π¯a satisfying 1 − λπ¯aπ¯a = 0 (Case B).

Eq. (183) can be written as

Z dpσ′(∂µ∂µ + m2)s(σ, σ′)ϕ(σ′, x) = 0,
s(σ, σ′) = (1 + λ∂¯a∂¯a)δp(σ − σ′).

where

The Fourier transform9 of s(σ, σ′) is

whose inverse is

Taking the Fourier transform of the latter expression, we obtain

s(π, π′) = δp(1 − λπ¯aπ¯a),

.

˜s(π, π′) =

δp(π − π′)
1 − λπ¯aπ¯a
˜s(σ, σ′) =Z dpπ eiπ¯a(σ¯a−σ′¯a)

(187)

(188)

(189)

(190)

(191)

(192)

(193)

(194)

(195)

This is the propagator in the space of parameters σ¯a, and is the inverse of s(σ, σ′).
We thus have

Z dσ′′˜s(σ, σ′′)s(σ′′, σ′) = δp(σ − σ′).

Multiplying Eq. (186) by ˜s(σ′′, σ), integrating over σ, using (191), and renaming σ′
into σ, we obtain

(∂µ∂µ + m2)ϕ(σ, x) = 0.

Eqs. (183) and (192), of course, correspond to (101) and (102), where

(1 + λ∂¯a∂¯a)ϕ(σ, x) = χ(σ, x) ≡ ϕ(σ)(x).

A general solution of Eq. (183) in Case A is

e−ipµxµ

+ a†(π, p)eiπ¯aσ¯a

eipµxµi .

This can be written as

ϕ(σ, x) =Z

with diﬀerent arguments.

28

q(2π) ¯D2ωp (cid:2)a(σ, p)e−ipµxµ

+ a†(σ, p)eipµxµ(cid:3) .

9 For simplicity reasons we use here the same symbol for the Fourier transformed quantity, but

where

a(σ, p) =Z dpπa(π, p)e−iπ¯aσ¯a

.

(196)

Identifying a(σ, p) ≡ a(σ)(p) we ﬁnd that (195) is the same equation as (106), as it
should be.

We see that our continuous bunch of scalar ﬁelds whose mutual interaction is given
by the ﬁeld space metric s(σ)(σ′ ) ≡ s(σ, σ′) (given in Eq. (128) or (187)) is described
by the action (182). This is an action for a ﬁeld ϕ(σ¯a, xµ), which depend not only
on spacetime coordinates xµ, but also on the brane parameters σ¯a. The action can
be written in terms of the metric (187), whose inverse is the propagator (190) on the
brane.

6 Conclusion

We have found a resolution of the problem of brane quantization, which can have
important implication for the brane world scenarios that consider our spacetime as
a brane living in a higher dimensional space. First we have shown that the Dirac-
Nambu-Goto brane can be described as a “point particle” in an inﬁnite dimensional
brane space with a special metric. The analogy with general relativity suggests that
the metric is dynamical and thus not necessarily restricted to the special form. As in
general relativity the simplest metric is that of ﬂat spacetime, so in the brane theory
the brane space can have a simple “ﬂat” metric as well. A ﬂat brane is like a bunch
of non interacting point particles. Upon quantization such a system is described by
the quantum ﬁeld theory of a continuous set of non interacting ﬁelds ϕσ, each one
describing a diﬀerent distinguishable particle.

We then considered an interacting system by introducing a coupling between the
ﬁelds. We achieved this by adding an extra term to the δ-function like metric in the
ﬁeld space. This extra, interacting, term was of the form λ∂¯a∂¯aδp(σ − σ′). Because
of the latter term, the time derivative of the expectation value of the momentum
operator, calculated for an evolving wave packet like state, does not vanish. We have
found that the center of the wave packet at each σ¯a satisﬁes the equations of motion
of a classical brane which is nearly like the usual Dirac-Nambu-Goto brane. The
diﬀerence is in the determinant ¯γ ≡ detγ¯a¯b of the induced metric on the brane being
restricted to ¯γ = −1. We also showed that the interacting term λ√−¯γ∂¯aγ ¯a¯b∂¯bδp(σ −
σ′) for a general metric γ¯a¯b and the corresponding determinant ¯γ leads to the equation
of motion of the Dirac-Nambu-Goto brane.

All this means that the special brane space metric for a Dirac-Nambu-Goto brane
was induced from the underlying ﬁeld theory of the continuous system of interacting
scalar ﬁelds, the interaction being given by a certain coupling term. If we chose a

29

diﬀerent coupling term, we would obtain a diﬀerent eﬀective classical brane, living in
a brane space whose metric were diﬀerent from that of the Dirac-Nambu-Goto brane.
In this paper we concentrated on scalar ﬁeld. But analogous procedure could be
applied to fermion ﬁelds as well. We considered the usual canonical ﬁeld quantiza-
tion, which is somewhat cumbersome because of the (1 + 3) split of spacetime. How
the present theory can be cast into the more elegant Fock-Schwinger proper time for-
malism, or into the Stueckelberg invariant evolution parameter formalism, is beyond
the scope of this paper, and will be shown elsewhere.

Appendix A: Position operator

The creation operator a†(x) for a particle at position x, although not Lorentz
covariant, is not problematic, if it is understood that its deﬁnition (72) is valid only
in a given Lorentz reference frame. Namely, in the quantum ﬁeld theory of a scalar
ﬁeld we have the operator a†(p) that creates a particle with momentum p. The
Fourier transform of a†(p) is

The position operator is then

a†(x) =

p(2π)3Z d3k a†(k)e−ikx
ˆx =Z d3x a†(x) x a(x) =Z d3p a†(p) i

This is quite a legitimate operator in the Lorentz frame with respect to which the
time t ≡ x0 and space x ≡ x¯µ, ¯µ = 1, 2, 3 are deﬁned. The diﬀerence with the usual
treatment is that our position creation and annihilation operators a†(x), a(x) are not
identiﬁed with the ﬁeld operators ϕ(x) (or the positive or negative frequency part of
ϕ(x)). They are just Fourier transforms of a†(p) and a(p). Since the latter operators
are legitimate objects of the ﬁeld theory, also a†(x), a(x) are legitimate objects in a
given Lorentz frame S, although they are not covariant objects. In a diﬀerent Lorentz
frame one must deﬁne those operators anew.

Taking the Hamiltonian10

Since p/p0 = v, the above expression is indeed the velocity operator. Exactly the
same equation (200) is satisﬁed by the Newton-Wigner position operator [11].
In
Ref. [12] it is pointed out that the state |xi created by a†(x) as deﬁned in Eq. (197)
is in fact the Newton-Wigner localized state.
From (198) we ﬁnd that ˆx is Hermitian, ˆx† = ˆx. We will show that it is self-

adjoint with respect to the scalar product in the x-space.

A single particle wave packet proﬁle is

|ψi =Z d3p g(p)a†(p)|0i =Z d3x f (x)a†(x)|0i,

where f (x) is the Fourier transform of g(p).
We deﬁne the scalar product according to

therefore the operator ˆx is self-adjoint with respect to the scalar product (202).
Analogous holds for many particle wave packet proﬁles.

The operators a†(x), a(x), ˆx have been deﬁned with respect to a particular (1+3)
split11 of spacetime, such that the simultaneity hypersurface Σµ coincides with the
space of coordinates x, whereas the orthogonal to Σµ points into the direction of the
time coordinates x0 ≡ t. In a diﬀerent (1 + 3) split, instead of xµ = (t, x), we have
diﬀerent coordinates x′µ = (t′, x′), and thus diﬀerent operators a†(x′), a(x′), ˆx′. To
diﬀerent (1 + 3) splits there correspond diﬀerent choices of simultaneity hypersurfaces
Σµ, and thus diﬀerent Lorentz frames. Our operators are thus deﬁned with respect a
a given Lorentz frame S, at a ﬁxed value of time t. In the frame S′ one has to deﬁne
diﬀerent operators, which are suitable creation/annihilation and position operators
in S′, but not in S. The theory is thus covariant in the sense that we can perform
diﬀerent (1+3) spits and deﬁne in each of them the creation/annihilation and position
operators. But those operators themselves are not Lorentz covariant objects12 and
cannot be transformed into another Lorentz reference frame. The transformation of

11 For simplicity reason we take here spatial dimension ¯D = 3.
12 It is often said that those quantities are not Lorentz invariant. But this is misleading, because
physical quantities need not be Lorentz invariant, they only need be Lorentz covariant; from a
diﬀerent Lorentz frame they may look diﬀerent.

a†(x) deﬁned in Eq. (197) into another Lorentz frame makes no sense. The same
is true for the localized state |xi = a†(x)|0i. It is not correct to say that such a
localized state in S when observed from S′ acquires the strange properties of giving
a nonzero amplitude for detection spread out all over space. To see how a localized
state looks from the frame S′, one must consider not only the basis state |xi, but

covariant operators a†(x), we obtain the appropriate equations for amplitudes, and
the corresponding 4-current which is a Lorentz covariant object.

Appendix B: Schr¨odinger equation and the probability cur-

rent for single particle wave packet proﬁles

In terms of the creation operators a†(p) or a†(x), a general single particle state

can be expressed as

|ψi =Z d

¯Dp g(p)a†(p)|0i =Z d

¯Dx f (x)a†(x)|0i.

(205)

Though we do not explicitly denote so, g and f depend on time t as well. The
Schr¨odinger equation is

f (x), so that δ ¯D(x − x′) becomes “free”, and can be integrated out. So we obtain
that the Schr¨odinger equation (209) for a single particle wave packet proﬁles is
satisﬁed if the amplitude satisﬁes [13]

(210)

The Hamilton operator in the above equation when expanded contains derivatives up
to inﬁnite order. Therefore the function f satisfying (210), even if initially f (0, x)
localized within a ﬁnite region, at any later time t has non vanishing values at all
points x. Therefore in the literature [13] it is usually said that such a wave function
is non local. But in Ref. [14] it was shown that f (t, x) which satisﬁes the initial
condition of a minimal uncertainty in position and momentum evolves as a wave
packet whose probability density is concentrated in a ﬁnite spatial region. Using
the results of Ref. [14] we have found that suﬃciently close to the initial time the
localization of such a wave packet is even more pronounced. The contribution of the
wave packet’s tail is small in comparison to the contribution of the region around the
wave packet’s center.

By the way, if f were a spinor, we could take the square root `a la Dirac, and (210)

would become the Dirac equation

i

∂f
∂t

= (mβ + iα∇)f.

(211)

In such a case, of course, a†(x) should be replaced by fermionic operators, and instead
of the scalar ﬁeld theory we would have the fermionic ﬁeld theory.

What about the probability density and current? From Eq. (200) we see that

f∗(x)f (x) = ρ(x)

(212)

can serve as the probability density. Diﬀerentiating ρ(x) with respect to time, and
using the Schr¨odinger equation (210), we obtain

˙ρ = i ((Hf∗)f − f∗(Hf )) .

Using the expansion

Hf =pm2 + (−i∇)2 f = m(cid:18)1 +

we can rewrite Eq. (213) in the form

Thus we can deﬁne the probability density accroding to (212), but for the corre-
sponding current we then have the cumbersome expression (216). In the case of the
Dirac equation (211), the current is the usual simple expression entering the 4-current
jµ = (f†f, f†αf ).

For a scalar ﬁeld, a covariant deﬁnition of the probability density can be derived

from the expectation value of the operator ˆp0 = (m2 + (−i∇)2))1/2:

We see that the manipulations with position creation/annihilation operators in the
x-representation are straightforward and lead to the result that make sense, and are
consistent with those in the usual scalar ﬁeld theory. The non covariantly deﬁned
operators a†(x), a(x) do not appear in the deﬁnition of the covariant object, the
4-current jµ = (j0, j), deﬁned in Eqs. (218), (221).

We will now complete our discussion by considering a state |ψi, deﬁned according
to Eq. (205), in which f (x) represent a localized state. Let us consider the case of a
state localized in the initial time t = 0 at position x0, so that

f (x) = f (0, x) = δ ¯D(x − x0).

(222)

The Fourier transformed wave packet proﬁle is

which, apart form the phase factor exp(imt), is just the Green function for a non
relativistic free particle. The full expansion gives (227), which is the Green function
for a single free relativistic particle [14].

Instead of the δ-function initial localization (223), we can take a Gaussian function

f (0, x) ∝ exp(cid:20) (x − x0)2

2σ0

(cid:21) .

(229)

This holds in S. Observed from another reference frame S′, moving with respect to
S with velocity v along the x1 ≡ x direction, the wave function transform according
to13

f (t, x) = f′(t′, x′) ∝ exp(cid:2)(1 − v2)(x′ − x′0)2 + (y′ − y′0)2 + (z′ − z′0)2(cid:3) ,

where t = 0 and t′ = − vx′
√1−v2 . This is also a localized wave packet, only the distance
is Lorentz contracted and diﬀerent points x′ are not simultaneous in S′. In deriving
(230) we used the transformations

, y = y′ , z = z′

(231)

(232)

13 We now take the 4D spacetime, and denote x1 ≡ x, x2 ≡ y, x3 ≡ z.

35

Taking t = t0 (which means that both points, x and x0, are simultaneous in S),
Eq. (232) gives t′ − t′0 = −v(x′ − x′0) (which means that those two points are not
simultaneous in S′). From Eq. (231) we then obtain x − x0 = √1 − v2(x′ − x′0), i.e.,
the length contraction along the x-direction.

We see that nothing strange happens with the particle localization if we observe
Instead of the spherical Gaussian (229) at t = 0,
it from another Lorentz frame.
we see in S′ an ellipsoidal Gaussian (230) function, each x′ taken at diﬀerent t′ =

−vx′/√1 − v2. This reﬂects the fact that in S the localization is on the simultaneity

hyper surface t = 0, which in S′ is not a simultaneity Hyper surface. The observer
in S′, of course, normally does not deﬁne the spread of a localized particle’s position
at diﬀerent values of his time t′, he deﬁnes it at the same value of t′, i.e., on the
simultaneity hyper surface of the Lorentz frame S′. Therefore the observer in S′
formulates the quantum ﬁeld theory with respect to S′ in the same manner as we
did with respect to S. In S′ one then obtains results concerning wave packets and
localization that are analogous to those that we obtained in the reference frame S.
As already mentioned, according to Ref. [14] such an initially Gaussian wave packet
evolves so that it remains localized in the sense that the contribution of its tail remains
small in comparison to the contribution around the wave packet’s center. Though the
tail contains superluminal propagation, it does not necessarily mean the violation of
causality, if the latter is properly deﬁned in terms of macroscopic modulated beams
that can bear information. Single particle events at space-like separations can not
transmit information, and therefore do not violate the properly deﬁned causality.

Appendix C: Comparison with the Newt-Wigner position

operator

If instead of the operators a(p), a†(p) satisfying the commutation relations

[a(p), a†(p)] = δ3(p − p′),

(233)

we use the operator ˜a(p) =p(2π)32ωp a(p), ˜a†(p) =p(2π)32ωp a†(p) satisfying

[˜a(p), ˜a†(p)] = (2π)32ωp δ3(p − p′),

In Eq. (238) we have precisely the well-known non local action of Newton-Wigner
position operator on a wave function f (x).

Why then in our paper we do not have such a non local action of the posi-
tion operator? Let us rewrite the state (236) in terms of the operators a†(p) =

˜a(p)/p(2π)32ωp. If we introduce g(p) = ˜g(p)/p(2π)32ωp, then (236) becomes

|ψi =Z dd3p g(p) a†(p)|0i,

(241)

where

f (x) =

i∇pg(p) = xf (x),

which is just our wave packet (205). But the state | ˜xi = ϕ(0, x)|0i deﬁned according
ot Eq. (237) is not the same as the position state |xi = a†(x)|0i used throughout this
paper. If we project ˆx|ψi onto |xi, then
hx| ˆx|ψi =Z d3p eipx
p(2π)3
p(2π)3 Z d3p eipxg(p).

It is well known that the states | ˜xi created by the Klein-Gordon ﬁeld operator
are not position states. If one uses such states, then h ˜x| ˆx|ψi of course gives a non
local result, which is indeed conﬁrmed in Eq. (238). If, on the contrary, one uses the
states |xi created by a†(x), then hx| ˆx|ψi gives the position eigenstates, as shown in
Eq. (241). The states |xi = a†(x)|0i are the basis states, deﬁned with respect to a
given Lorentz reference frame. They are not dynamical objects of the theory, they
do not satisfy the Schr¨odinger equation. On the other hand, the state |ψi, whose
deﬁnition (240) is equivalent to the deﬁnition (236), must satisfy the Schr¨odinger
equation. The state |ψi is a Lorentz covariant object. It is the state |ψi, not |xi,

diﬀerent Lorentz frames, etc.) are to be considered.
