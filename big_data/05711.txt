VANISHING OF EXT AND TOR OVER FIBER PRODUCTS

SAEED NASSEH AND SEAN SATHER-WAGSTAFF

Abstract. Consider a non-trivial ﬁber product R = S ×k T of local rings S,
T with common residue ﬁeld k. Given two ﬁnitely generate R-modules M and
N , we show that if TorR
i+1(M, N ) for some i > 5, then
pdR(M ) 6 1 or pdR(N ) 6 1. From this, we deduce several consequence, for
instance, that R satisﬁes the Auslander-Reiten Conjecture.

i (M, N ) = 0 = TorR

1. Introduction

Throughout this paper, let (S, mS, k) and (T, mT , k) be commutative local (mean-
πT←−− T denote the natural surjections
ing local and noetherian) rings. Let S
onto the common residue ﬁeld, and assume that S 6= k 6= T . Throughout, let R
denote the ﬁber product (i.e., the pull-back) ring

πS−−→ k

R := S ×k T = {(s, t) ∈ S × T | πS(s) = πT (t)} .

It is also commutative and local with maximal ideal mR = mS ⊕ mT and residue
ﬁeld k. And it is universal with respect to the next commutative diagram.

/ k

Also, the subsets mS, mT ⊆ R are ideals of R, and we have ring isomorphisms
S ∼= R/mT and T ∼= R/mS.

Many results about R state that its properties reﬂect those of the rings S and T .
For instance, Dress and Kr¨amer [12, Remark 3] show that for every ﬁnitely gener-
ated R-module N , the second syzygy of N decomposes as a direct sum N ′ ∼= N1⊕N2
where N1 is a ﬁnitely generated S-module and N2 is a ﬁnitely generated T -module.
Other examples of this include work of Moore [19, Theorem 1.8] which shows how,
given a ﬁnitely generated S-module M1, one can use the minimal S-free resolution
of M1 with the minimal free resolutions of k over S and T to obtain the minimal
R-free resolution of M1. (Fact 2.2 below describes part of this construction.) See,
e.g., the papers of Kostrikin and ˇSafareviˇc [16] and Lescot [18] for more results in
this theme. The point here is that the module category of R is deeply related to
the module categories of S and T .

However, there are glaring counterpoints to this theme. For instance, one con-

sequence of Lescot’s work is the equality

depth(R) = min{depth(S), depth(T ), 1}.

(∗)

(See, e.g., Christensen, Striuli, and Veliche [11, (3.2.1)].) Technically, this describes
the depth of R in terms of the depths of S and T , but it shows, for instance, that
R is almost never Cohen-Macaulay, even when S and T are so.

The results of this paper give further counterpoints to this theme. For instance,
the next result is contained in Theorems 2.7 and 2.12. In the language of Celikbas
and Sather-Wagstaﬀ [7] this result says that every R-module of inﬁnite projective
dimension is a “pd-test module”.

Theorem 1.1. Let M and N be ﬁnitely generated modules over the ﬁber product R.
(a) If depth(S) = 0 or depth(T ) = 0 and TorR
i (M, N ) = 0 for some i > 5, then M

or N is free over R.

(b) In general, if TorR
1 or pdR(N ) 6 1.

i (M, N ) = 0 = TorR

i+1(M, N ) for some i > 5, then pdR(M ) 6

This result gives another counterpoint to the above theme because, even if S
and T have Tor-independent modules of inﬁnite projective dimension (e.g., if S =
k[U, V, X, Y ]/((U, V )2 + (X, Y )2) ∼= T ), the theorem shows that R will not have
such modules. Section 2 is primarily devoted to the proof of this result. In the
subsequent Section 3, we explore the consequences for “depth formulas” over R;
some of these are expected, others are surprising to us.

The ﬁnal Section 4 documents Ext-vanishing results that follow from Theo-
rem 1.1. For instance, the next result, contained in Theorem 4.5, shows that the
ﬁber product R satisﬁes the Auslander-Reiten Conjecture, regardless of whether we
know it for S or T .

Theorem 1.2. Let M be a ﬁnitely generated module over the ﬁber product R. If
Exti

R(M, M ⊕ R) = 0 for i > 1, then M is R-free.

2. Tor-Vanishing

In this section we prove Theorem 1.1 from the introduction, beginning with some
preliminary facts. Recall that R is a non-trivial ﬁber product, as described above.

Fact 2.1 ([12, Remark 3]). For every ﬁnitely generated R-module N , the second
syzygy of N decomposes as a direct sum N ′ ∼= N1 ⊕ N2 where N1 is a ﬁnitely
generated S-module and N2 is a ﬁnitely generated T -module; in other words, N1 is
a ﬁnitely generated R-module annihilated by mT , and similarly for N2. Moreover,
the proof of [12, Remark 3] shows the following. The syzygy N ′ is a submodule of
a ﬁnite-rank free R-module Rn, as the image of an R-linear map f : Rm → Rn, and
we have N2 = Im(f )∩ mT Rn ⊆ mT Rn ∼= mT T n, and similarly for N1. In particular,
N2 is a ﬁrst syzygy over T and N1 is a ﬁrst syzygy over S.

Fact 2.2 ([19, Theorem 1.8]). Let M1 be a ﬁnitely generated S-module. We de-
scribe part of a minimal R-free resolution of M1, in terms of the following:
(1) Let Sβ2

d1−→ Sβ0 be the beginning of a minimal S-free resolution of M1.

d2−→ Sβ1

(In particular, βi is the ith Betti number βS

i (M1) of M1 over S.)

(2) Let Sb1

f1−→ S be a minimal S-free presentation of k where f1 is a 1 × b1 matrix

whose entries minimally generate mS. (In particular, b1 = βS

1 (k).)

VANISHING OF EXT AND TOR OVER FIBER PRODUCTS

(3) Let T c2

g2−→ T c1

g1−→ T be the beginning of a minimal T -free resolution of k
where g1 is a 1×c1 matrix whose entries minimally generate mT . (In particular,
c1 = βT

1 (k).)

Then a minimal R-free resolution of M1 begins as follows.

Here each entry in each matrix is induced by the corresponding map from (1)–(3)

0 0 bf1 g2(cid:21)
Rβ2 ⊕ Rc1β1 ⊕ Rb1c1β0 ⊕ Rc2β0 (cid:20)fd2 bg1 0 0
−−−−−−−−−→ Rβ1 ⊕ Rc1β0 [fd1 g1]
above. For instance, ed2 uses the same matrix as d2, only considered over R; in
particular, these entries are in mS. And bg1 uses β1-many copies of the matrix for

g1; in particular, these entries are in mT .

−−−−−→ Rβ0

(2.2.1)

Our ﬁrst lemma is akin to [20, Lemma 3.2], though our proof is vastly diﬀerent.

Lemma 2.3. Let M1, N1 be ﬁnitely generated S-modules, and let M2, N2 be ﬁnitely
generated T -modules. Then there are isomorphisms over the ﬁber product R.

The next two lemmas are essentially applications of the previous one, for use in

our ﬁrst main theorem.

Lemma 2.4. Let M1, N1 be ﬁnitely generated S-modules, and let M2 be a ﬁnitely
generated T -module. Assume that M1 6= 0 = TorR

1 (M1 ⊕ M2, N1); then N1 = 0.

Proof. Our assumptions imply that we have βS
TorR

1 (M2, N1). Also, the assumption T 6= k implies that βT
Suppose by way of contradiction that N1 6= 0. From Lemma 2.3, we have

0 (M1) 6= 0 and TorR
1 (k) 6= 0.

1 (M1, N1) = 0 =

0 = TorR

1 (k)βS

so mSN βT
mSN1 = 0. Thus, we have N1 ∼= kβS
a summand of N1. Again, appealing to Lemma 2.3, we have

= 0. The previous paragraph shows that this implies that
0 (N1). The supposition N1 6= 0 implies that k is

0 = TorR

1 (M2, N1) ∼= TorS

1 (N1, k) ⊕(cid:16)mSN βT

1

1 (M2)

(cid:17)

1 (N1, k) = 0. The fact that k is a summand of N1 implies that TorS

so TorS
contradicting the assumption that S 6= k.

1 (k, k) = 0,
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.5. Let M1, N1 be ﬁrst syzygies over S of ﬁnitely generated S-modules,
and let M2, N2 be ﬁrst syzygies over T of ﬁnitely generated T -modules. Assume
that depth(S) = 0 or depth(T ) = 0, and set M := M1 ⊕ M2 and N := N1 ⊕ N2.
Assume that TorR

1 (M, N ) = 0; then M = 0 or N = 0.

Proof. Assume that M1 ⊕ M2 = M 6= 0. We need to show that N = 0. By
symmetry, assume further that M1 6= 0. The assumption TorR
1 (M, N ) = 0 implies
that TorR

1 (M1 ⊕ M2, N1) = 0, so Lemma 2.4 implies that N1 = 0.

Suppose by way of contradiction that N2 6= 0. Another application of the Tor-

vanishing assumption, using Lemma 2.3, implies that

0 = TorR

1 (M1, N2) ∼= TorT

1 (k, N2) ⊕hmT N βS

1 (M1)

i ∼= TorS

1 (M1, k) ⊕hmSM βT

i

1 (k, N2) = 0 = TorS

so we have TorT
1 (M1, k). We conclude that M1 6= 0 is free over
S and N2 6= 0 is free over T , so S is a summand of M1 and T is a summand of
N2. Since M1 is a syzygy over S, we have S ⊆ M1 ⊆ mSSm for some m > 1.
If depth(S) = 0, this is impossible. Indeed, this implies that there is an element
t ∈ mSSm such that the map S → mSSm given by s 7→ st is a monomorphism;
however, the socle Soc(S) 6= 0 is contained in the kernel of this map.

On the other hand, the fact that N2 is a syzygy over T yields a contradiction in
(cid:3)

the case depth(T ) = 0.

Remark 2.6. The following computation

TorR

1 (S, T ) = TorR

1 (R/mT , R/mS) ∼= (mS ∩ mT )/(mS mT ) = 0

shows the necessity of the syzygy assumptions in the previous result, since S, T 6= 0.
The isomorphism here is standard.

The following result contains Theorem 1.1(a) from the introduction.

Theorem 2.7. Let M , N be ﬁnitely generated modules over the ﬁber product R.
If depth(S) = 0 or depth(T ) = 0, then the following conditions are equivalent.

(i) TorR

i (M, N ) = 0 for i ≫ 0

VANISHING OF EXT AND TOR OVER FIBER PRODUCTS

(ii) TorR
i (M, N ) = 0 for all i > 1
(iii) TorR
i (M, N ) = 0 for some i > 5
(iv) pdR(M ) < ∞ or pdR(N ) < ∞
(v) M or N is R-free

1 (M ′, N ′) ∼= TorR

3 (M, N ′) ∼= TorR

1 ⊕ M ′

1, N ′

Proof. Assume for this paragraph that there exists an integer i > 5 such that
TorR
i (M, N ) = 0; we prove that M or N is R-free. Let M ′ be the second syzygy
of M , and let N ′ be the (i − 3)rd syzygy of N . Dimension-shift to conclude that
TorR
i (M, N ) = 0. The assumption i > 5 implies
i − 3 > 2. Thus, Fact 2.1 implies that M ′ = M ′
1 ⊕ N ′
2 where
M ′
2 are (ﬁnitely
generated) ﬁrst syzygies over T . Thus, Lemma 2.5 implies that M ′ = 0 or N ′ = 0.
In light of the construction of M ′ and N ′, it follows that pdR(M ) 6 1 < ∞ or
pdR(N ) 6 i−4 < ∞. By equation (∗) from the introduction, we have depth(R) = 0.
Thus, by the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula, we have pdR(M ) = 0 or pdR(N ) = 0.
Using the previous paragraph, for n = i, . . . , iv we have (n) =⇒ (v). The
(cid:3)

1 are (ﬁnitely generated) ﬁrst syzygies over S, and M ′

2 and N ′ = N ′
2, N ′

converses of these implications are routine.

Theorem 2.7 gives the following slightly weaker version of a result of Nasseh and
Yoshino [20, Theorem 3.1]; see also [5, Proposition 5.2]. This result uses the “trivial
extension” S ⋉ k; as an additive abelian group, this is S ⊕ k, and multiplication is
given by the formula (s, x)(t, y) := (st, sy + tx). One shows readily that there is an
isomorphism S ⋉ k ∼= S ×k (k[x]/(x2)). Our result is slightly weaker than Nasseh
and Yoshino’s result because that result only requires i > 3; note that they also
give an example showing that this range of i-values is optimal in their setting.

Corollary 2.8. Assume that M and N are non-zero ﬁnitely generated S ⋉ k-
modules such that TorS⋉k
(M, N ) = 0 for some i > 5; then M or N is free over
S ⋉ k.

i

Here is an example showing that in the general setting of Theorem 2.7, vanishing
of TorR
3 (M, N ) is not enough to guarantee pdR(M ) < ∞ or pdR(N ) < ∞, in con-
trast to the special case of [20, Theorem 3.1]. Neither are two sequential vanishings
TorR
3 (M, N ) enough. (See also Theorem 2.12 below.) In the
example, we use the following straightforward fact: If 0 6= s ∈ mS and 0 6= t ∈ mT ,
then AnnR(s + t) = AnnS(s) ⊕ AnnT (t).

2 (M, N ) = 0 = TorR

Example 2.9. Consider the local artinian rings S := k[U, V ]/(U 2, V 2) and T :=
k[X, Y ]/(X 2, Y 2), and set R := S ×k T as usual. Use lower-case letters u, v, x, y to
represent the residues of the variables U, V, X, Y in R and in the respective rings S
and T . With M = R/(u+x)R and N = R/(v+y)R, we claim that TorR
i (M, N ) = 0
if and only if i = 2 or 3.

Note that M and N are not free over R, since they have non-trivial annihilators.
Since depth(R) = 0, the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula implies that M and N have
inﬁnite projective dimension. By Theorem 2.7, it follows that TorR
i (M, N ) 6= 0 for
0 (M, N ) ∼= M ⊗R N ∼= R/(u + x, y + v)R 6= 0.
all i > 5. In addition, we have TorR
Thus, it remains to show that TorR
1 (M, N ) 6= 0 = TorR
3 (M, N ) 6=
TorR

4 (M, N ). To this end, we note the following straightforward computation.

2 (M, N ) = TorR

(uS ⊕ xT ) ∩ (vS ⊕ yT ) = uvS ⊕ xyT = (uS ⊕ xT ) · (vS ⊕ yT )

(2.9.1)

6

SAEED NASSEH AND SEAN SATHER-WAGSTAFF

Next, we explain the ﬁrst equality in the following display

(u + x)R ∩ (v + y)R = uvS ⊕ xyT 6= (uv + xy)R = (u + x)R · (v + y)R.

(2.9.2)

Here, the containment (u + x)R ∩ (v + y)R ⊆ uvS ⊕ xyT follows from (2.9.1) since
we have (u + x)R ⊆ (uS ⊕ xT ) and (v + y)R ⊆ (vS ⊕ yT ). The reverse containment
follows from the equalities v(u + x) = uv = u(v + y) and x(v + y) = xy = y(u + x).
(The other steps in (2.9.2) are even more straightforward.) Similarly, we have

(uS ⊕ xT ) ∩ (v + y)R = (uS ⊕ xT ) · (v + y)R.

(2.9.3)

Now we show how this helps us to compute TorR
the formula TorR

1 (R/I, R/J) ∼= (I ∩ J)/IJ, ﬁrst for i = 1:

i (M, N ). We make repeated use of

TorR

1 (M, N ) = TorR

1 (R/(u + x)R, R/(v + y)R) ∼=

(u + x)R ∩ (v + y)R
(u + x)R · (v + y)R

6= 0

where the non-vanishing is from (2.9.2). Similarly, as the paragraph preceding
this example shows AnnR(u + x) = uS ⊕ xT , the next computation follows by
dimension-shifting and using (2.9.3).

TorR

2 (M, N ) = TorR

1 (R/(uS ⊕ xT ), R/(v + y)R) ∼=

(uS ⊕ xT ) ∩ (v + y)R
(uS ⊕ xT ) · (v + y)R

= 0

Similarly, from (2.9.1) we have TorR
TorR

4 (M, N ) 6= 0. To this end, again by dimension-shifting we have

3 (M, N ) = 0. Thus, it remains to show that

TorR

4 (M, N ) ∼= TorR
∼= TorR
∼= TorR

2 (R/(uS ⊕ xT ), R/(vS ⊕ yT ))
1 (uS ⊕ xT, R/(vS ⊕ yT ))
1 (uS, R/(vS ⊕ yT )) ⊕ TorR

1 (xT, R/(vS ⊕ yT )).

So, it suﬃces to show that TorR

1 (uS, R/(vS ⊕ yT )) 6= 0, which we show next.

TorR

1 (uS, R/(vS ⊕ yT )) ∼= TorR
∼= TorR

1 (R/ AnnR(u), R/(vS ⊕ yT ))
1 (R/(uS ⊕ mT ), R/(vS ⊕ yT ))

∼=

=

(uS ⊕ mT ) ∩ (vS ⊕ yT )
(uS ⊕ mT ) · (vS ⊕ yT )
uvS ⊕ yT
uvS ⊕ ymT

6= 0

This completes the example.

Remark 2.10. As in the preceding example, one can show that the ring R =
k[[U, V ]]/(U V ) ×k k[[X, Y ]]/(XY ) with the modules M = R/(u + x)R and N =
R/(v + y)R satisfy TorR
i (M, N ) = 0 if and only if i = 1 or 3. (Note that this ring
ﬁts in the context of Theorem 2.12 below.)

Next, we work on the case where S and T both have positive depth.

Lemma 2.11. Let M1, N1 be ﬁrst syzygies over S of ﬁnitely generated S-modules,
and let M2, N2 be ﬁrst syzygies over T of ﬁnitely generated T -modules. Set M :=
M1 ⊕ M2 and N := N1 ⊕ N2. Assume that TorR
2 (M, N ); then
M = 0 or N = 0.

1 (M, N ) = 0 = TorR

VANISHING OF EXT AND TOR OVER FIBER PRODUCTS

7

Proof. As in the beginning of the proof of Lemma 2.5, we assume that M1 6= 0,
and conclude that N1 = 0. And we suppose by way of contradiction that N2 6= 0.
An application of (a symmetric version of) Lemma 2.4 implies that M2 = 0.

By Fact 2.2, a minimal R-free presentation of M1 = M has the following form:

In particular, we have

Rβ1 ⊕ Rc1β0 [fd1 g1]

−−−−−→ Rβ0.

Im(g1) = Im(g1)Rβ0 = mT Rβ0 6= 0

(2.11.1)

where the non-vanishing follows from the assumption T 6= k.

Next, set M ′ = Im[ed1 g1] ⊆ Rβ0, i.e., M ′ is the ﬁrst syzygy of M in the above

minimal presentation. Since M is a ﬁrst syzygy, the module M ′ is a second syzygy,
and Fact 2.1 implies that M ′ ∼= M ′
2 where mT M ′
2. Moreover,
this Fact explains the ﬁrst equality in the next display.

1 = 0 = mSM ′

1 ⊕ M ′

M ′

2 = Im[ed1 g1] ∩ (mT Rβ0) ⊇ Im(g1) ∩ (mT Rβ0) = mT Rβ0 6= 0

The containment here is straightforward; the second equality and the non-vanishing
are from (2.11.1).

(2.11.2)

Dimension-shifting gives 0 = TorR

2 6=
0 from (2.11.2), with Lemma 2.4 implies that N2 = 0, contradicting the supposition
in the ﬁrst paragraph of this proof. In other words, we must have N2 = 0. With
the already established N1 = 0, we conclude that N = 0, as desired.
(cid:3)

Proof. Argue as in the proof of Theorem 2.7, using Lemma 2.11 in lieu of 2.5. (cid:3)

In the preceding result, the next remark shows that even if one assumes that
i (M, N ) = 0 for all i > 1, one cannot conclude that M or N is free (unless, of

TorR
course, one is in the setting of Theorem 2.7).

Remark 2.13. Indeed, assume that S and T have positive depth, so we have
depth(R) = 1 by equation (3.1.1). Let f ∈ mR be R-regular, and set M := R/f R.
Then pdR(M ) = 1, so TorR
i (M, −) = 0 for all i > 2. By dimension-shifting, if N is
a syzygy over R of inﬁnite projective dimension, e.g., if N is a non-principal ideal
of R, then TorR

i (M, N ) = 0 for all i > 1, even though M and N are not free.

In light of the preceding theorems and examples, we pose the following.

Question 2.14. Let M , N be ﬁnitely generated modules over the ﬁber product R.
If TorR
4 (M, N ) = 0, must one of the modules M , N have ﬁnite projective dimension?

3. Auslander’s Depth Formula

In this section, we document some consequences of the above results for Auslan-
der’s “depth formula” from [2, Theorem 1.2]. This subject has received considerable
attention recently; see, e.g., work of Araya and Yoshino [1], Christensen and Jor-
gensen [10], and Foxby [13].

For part of the proof of the ﬁrst result of this section, we work in the derived
category D(R) with objects equal to the R-complexes (i.e., the chain complexes of
R-modules) indexed homologically. References for this include Christensen, Foxby,
and Holm [17], Hartshorne and Grothendieck [15], and Verdier [22, 23]. We say
that an R-complex X is homologically ﬁnite if the total homology module H(X) =
R(X, Y ) := H−i(RHomR(X, Y )) and

Li∈Z Hi(X) is ﬁnitely generated. We set Exti

depthR(X) = inf{i ∈ Z | Exti

R(k, X) 6= 0}.

Theorem 3.1. Let M , N be non-zero ﬁnitely generated modules over the ﬁber
product R such that TorR

i (M, N ) = 0 for all i ≫ 0. Set

q := max{i > 0 | TorR

i (M, N ) 6= 0}.

Assume that at least one of the following conditions holds.

q (M, N )) 6 1

(1) q = 0
(2) depthR(TorR
(3) depth(S) = 0 or depth(T ) = 0
(4) one of the modules M , N is a syzygy of a ﬁnitely generated R-module
(5) one of the modules M , N is S or T
(6) depth(N ) = 0 and pdR(N ) = ∞
Then we have q 6 1 and

depthR(M ) + depthR(N ) = depth(R) + depthR(TorR

q (M, N )) − q.

(3.1.1)

Proof. Theorem 2.12 implies that q 6 1 and, say, pdR(M ) 6 1. Thus it remains
to establish equation (3.1.1) under any of the conditions (1)–(6). In cases (1)–(2)
this is from [2, Theorem 1.2]. Theorem 2.7 shows that (3) =⇒ (1). In particular,
we assume for the remainder of this proof that depth(S), depth(T ) > 1.

(4) In the case where N is a syzygy of some ﬁnitely generated R-module L, for

i > 1 we have

TorR

i (M, N ) ∼= TorR

i+1(M, L) = 0

since pdR(M ) 6 1, by dimension-shifting. On the other hand, if M is a syzygy of
L, we have pdR(L) 6 depth(R) = 1 by Auslander-Buchsbaum, so M is free. In
each case, we conclude that q = 0, so we are done by case (1).

(5) The assumption depth(S) > 1 yields an S-regular element f ∈ mS. It follows
readily that f R ∼= f S ∼= S so S is a syzygy over R, namely, the ﬁrst syzygy of
R/f R. Symmetrically, we see that T is an R-syzygy, so this case follows from the
preceding one.

(6) Assume that depth(N ) = 0 and pdR(N ) = ∞. Assume further that q = 1 =
pdR(M ) and depth(S), depth(T ) > 1, otherwise we are in the situation of case (1)
or (3). Thus, we have depth(R) = 1 by equation (∗) from the introduction, and
depthR(M ) = 0 by the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula. We need to show that

depthR(M ) + depthR(N ) = depth(R) + depthR(TorR

1 (M, N )) − 1.

VANISHING OF EXT AND TOR OVER FIBER PRODUCTS

In light of our assumptions, this reduces to showing that depthR(TorR
That is, we need to show that mR ∈ AssR(TorR

1 (M, N )).

1 (M, N )) = 0.

From [13, Lemma 2.1], we have

depthR(M ⊗L

R N ) = depthR(M ) + depthR(N ) − depth(R)

= −1
= − sup{i ∈ Z | TorR

i (M, N ) 6= 0}.

Thus, according to [8, (1.6.6)], we have mR ∈ AssR(TorR

1 (M, N )), as desired.

(cid:3)

Because of the strength of Theorems 2.7 and 2.12, we were surprised to ﬁnd
the next examples which show that the depth formula (3.1.1) fails over the ﬁber
product R in the general case q = 1 when depth(S), depth(T ) > 1.

Example 3.2. Set S := k[[U, V, W ]] and T := k[[X, Y, Z]] with prime ideals p := U S
and q := (Y, Z)T . We consider the ﬁber product R and the R-modules M =
R/(U + X)R and N = S/p ⊕ T /q. Since U + X is R-regular, we have pdR(M ) = 1.
U+X
Using the minimal free resolution 0 → R
−−−→ R → M → 0 we have the ﬁrst
isomorphism in the next display

U+X

1 (M, N ) ∼= Ker(cid:16)N
∼= Ker(cid:16)S/p
∼= Ker(cid:16)S/p

−−−→ N(cid:17)
U+X−−−→ S/p(cid:17) ⊕ Ker(cid:16)T /q
U−→ S/p(cid:17) ⊕ Ker(cid:16)T /q

U+X−−−→ T /q(cid:17)
X−→ T /q(cid:17)

TorR

∼= S/p.

The second isomorphism is from the deﬁnition of N , and the third one follows from
the vanishings X(S/p) = 0 = U (T /q). For the last isomorphism here, note that X
is (T /q)-regular and that U (S/p) = 0.

From this, we have

depthR(TorR

1 (M, N )) = depthR(S/p) = 2

and the next display is by construction

depthR(N ) = min{depthR(S/p), depthR(T /q)} = min{2, 1} = 1.

As we have depth(R) = 1 by equation (∗) from the introduction, the fact that
U + X is R-regular implies depthR(M ) = 0. From these facts, we ﬁnd that

depthR(M ) + depthR(N ) = 1 < 2 = depth(R) + depthR(TorR

1 (M, N )) − 1

so the depth formula (3.1.1) fails here.

Example 3.3. Set S = k[[u, x, y, z, a]] and T = k[[v]]. In [1, Example 2.9], the au-
thors construct an ideal I ⊆ S such that the module N := S/I satisﬁes depthS(N ) =
3 and depthS(TorS
1 (S/aS, N )) = 2. The module S/aS has projective dimension 1
over S, and one checks easily that
depthS(S/aS) + depthS(N ) = 7 > 6 = depth(S) + depthS(TorS

1 (S/aS, N )) − 1.

Let R be the ﬁber product, as usual, and set M = R/(a + v)R. By equation (∗)
from the introduction, we have depth(R) = 1. The element a + v is R-regular, so

10

SAEED NASSEH AND SEAN SATHER-WAGSTAFF

pdR(M ) = 1. Also, one has depthR(N ) = depthS(N ) = 3. In the next display, the
isomorphisms are routine, and the equality is from the condition vN = 0.

TorR

1 (M, N ) ∼= Ker(N a+v−−→ N ) = Ker(N a−→ N ) ∼= TorS

1 (S/aS, N )

We conclude that depthR(TorR

1 (M, N )) = depthS(TorS

1 (S/aS, N )) = 2, so

depthR(M ) + depthR(N ) = 3 > 2 = depth(R) + depthR(TorR

1 (M, N )) − 1
so the depth formula (3.1.1) fails here, in the opposite way from Example 3.2.

The next result shows that the previous example is, in a sense, minimal with

respect to the particular failure of the depth formula (3.1.1).

Proposition 3.4. Let (A, mA) be a commutative local noetherian ring, and let M ,
N be ﬁnitely generated A-modules such that pdA(M ) = 1. If depthA(N ) 6 2, then

depthA(M ) + depthA(N ) 6 depth(A) + depthA(TorA

1 (M, N )) − 1.

Proof. In the case depthR(N ) = 0, the desired inequality follows by the Auslander-
Buchsbaum formula for M . So, we assume for the rest of the proof that depthA(N )
is 1 or 2. Consider a minimal free resolution

0 → Am → An → M → 0

wherein m, n 6= 0 since pdA(M ) = 1. It follows that there is an exact sequence

0 → TorA

1 (M, N ) → N m → N n → M ⊗A N → 0.

Break this into short exact sequences
1 (M, N ) → N m → V → 0

0 → TorA

0 → V → N n → M ⊗A N → 0

and apply the Depth Lemma; the assumption 1 6 depthA(N ) 6 2 implies that

depthA(V ) > min{depthA(N ), depthA(M ⊗A N ) + 1} > 1

depthA(TorA

1 (M, N )) > min{depthA(N ), depthA(V ) + 1} > depthA(N ).

In light of the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula for M , which has projective dimension
1, the preceding display yields the desired inequality.
(cid:3)

4. Ext-Vanishing

The results of this section, like those of Section 2, give counterpoints to the
theme discussed in Section 1: the conclusions here hold over the ﬁber product R,
whether or not they hold over S or T .

It is worth noting here that much of the machinery we invoke in the proof of the
next result is developed in signiﬁcant generality in the forthcoming [6]. Thus, we
only sketch the proof.

Proposition 4.1. Let M and N be homologically ﬁnite complexes over the ﬁber
product R such that Exti
R(M, N ) = 0 for i ≫ 0, then pdR(M ) < ∞ or idR(N ) < ∞.

Proof. First, note that if X, Y are homologically ﬁnite R-complexes such that
TorR
i (X, Y ) = 0 for i ≫ 0, then pdR(X) < ∞ or pdR(Y ) < ∞. Indeed, take suﬃ-
ciently high syzygies in minimal R-free resolutions of X and Y . These are ﬁnitely
generated and Tor-independent, so the conclusion follows from Theorem 2.12.

Let K denote the Koszul complex over R on a ﬁnite generating sequence for
R N = K ⊗R N is homologically ﬁnite and,

mR. It follows that the complex K ⊗L

VANISHING OF EXT AND TOR OVER FIBER PRODUCTS

Let E := ER(k) be the injective hull of k over R. Since H(K ⊗L

furthermore, has homology annihilated by mR. Thus, it has ﬁnite length total
homology module. Moreover, we have idR(K ⊗L
RN ) < ∞ if and only if idR(N ) < ∞.
R N ) has ﬁnite
length, so does H(RHomR(K ⊗L
R N, E) is
homologically ﬁnite. With the “Hom-evaluation” isomorphism of Avramov and
Foxby [4, Lemma 4.4(I)]

R N, E)); in particular, RHomR(K ⊗L

R N, E)
the preceding paragraph implies that pdR(M ) < ∞ or pdR(RHomR(K ⊗L
∞. It follows readily that pdR(M ) < ∞ or idR(K ⊗L
or idR(N ) < ∞, as desired.

RN, E)) <
R N ) < ∞, i.e., pdR(M ) < ∞
(cid:3)

R N ), E) ≃ M ⊗L

R RHomR(K ⊗L

Next, we document some consequences of the preceding proposition.

Corollary 4.2. Let M , N be ﬁnitely generated modules over the ﬁber product R.
If Exti

R(M, N ) = 0 for i ≫ 0, then pdR(M ) 6 1 or idR(N ) 6 1.

Proof. This follows from Proposition 4.1, via the Auslander-Buchsbaum and Bass
formulas, since depth(R) 6 1 by equation (∗).
(cid:3)

Corollary 4.3. Assume that depth(S) = 0 and that S or T is not artinian. Let M ,
N be non-zero ﬁnitely generated modules over the ﬁber product R. If Exti
R(M, N ) =
0 for i ≫ 0, then M is R-free.

Proof. Equation (∗) shows that depth(R) = 0. Thus, the preceding result (with the
Auslander-Buchsbaum and Bass formulas) shows that M is free or N is injective.
Since R surjects onto S and T , one of which is not artinian, we know that R is not
artinian, so it does not have a ﬁnitely generated injective module. In particular, N
is not injective, so M is free.
(cid:3)

The next result is immediate from the previous one. It says that the ﬁber product

R has “Ext-index” at most depth(R) 6 1. See equation (∗).

R(M, N ) = 0 for i ≫ 0. Then Exti

Corollary 4.4. Let M , N be ﬁnitely generated modules over the ﬁber product R
such that Exti
R(M, N ) = 0 for all i > depth(R).
The next result says in particular that the ﬁber product R satisﬁes the Auslander-
Reiten Conjecture. It contains Theorem 1.2 from the introduction, and it follows,
e.g., from the previous corollary and [9, Theorem 2.3].

Theorem 4.5. Let M be a ﬁnitely generated module over the ﬁber product R.
(a) If Exti
(b) If Exti

R(M, M ⊕ R) = 0 for i ≫ 0, then pdR(M ) 6 1.
R(M, M ⊕ R) = 0 for i > 1, then M is R-free.

The next result provides yet another cointerpoint the the theme from Section 1,
as one can easily construct examples where S and T have non-trivial semidualiz-
ing complexes (even modules); recall that a homologically ﬁnite R-complex C is
semidualizing if RHomR(C, C) ≃ R in D(R).

Corollary 4.6. The ﬁber product R has at most two semidualizing complexes, up
to shift-isomorphism, namely R and a dualizing R-complex (if R has one).

Proof. By deﬁnition, if C is a semidualizing R-complex, then it is homologically
ﬁnite such that Exti
R(C, C) = 0 for all i > 1. Thus, Proposition 4.1 implies that
pdR(C) < ∞ or idR(C) < ∞, that is, C ≃ ΣnR for some n ∈ Z (by a result of
Christensen [8, Theorem 8.1]) or C is dualizing (by deﬁnition).
(cid:3)

SAEED NASSEH AND SEAN SATHER-WAGSTAFF

It is not clear to us when the ﬁber product R has a dualizing complex. Of course,
if it does, then so do the homomorphic images S and T . On the other hand, if S
and T are complete, then so is R by a result of Grothendieck [14, (19.3.2.1)], so R
has a dualizing complex in this case. Hence, we pose the following.

Question 4.7. If S and T admit dualizing complexes, must R also admit one?

Next, we recall Auslander and Bridger’s G-dimension [3]. A ﬁnitely generated
R-module G is totally reﬂexive if HomR(HomR(G, R), R) ∼= G and Exti
R(G, R) =
0 = Exti
R(HomR(G, R), R) for all i > 1. Every ﬁnitely generated free R-module is
totally reﬂexive, so every ﬁnitely generated R-module M has a resolution by totally
reﬂexive modules. If M has a bounded resolution by totally reﬂexive modules, then
the G-dimension of M is the length of the shortest such resolution. The following
result says, in the language of Takahashi [21], that our ring R is “G-regular”.

Corollary 4.8. Assume that the ﬁber product R is not Gorenstein.1 Let M be a
ﬁnitely generated R-module. Then one has pdR(M ) = G-dimR(M ). In particular,
M is totally reﬂexive if and only if it is free.

Proof. By [3, 4.13], it suﬃces to assume that G-dimR(M ) < ∞, and prove that
pdR(M ) < ∞. This assumption implies that we have Exti
R(M, R) = 0 for i ≫ 0, so
Corollary 4.2 implies that pdR(M ) < ∞ or idR(R) < ∞. Since R is not Gorenstein,
it follows that pdR(M ) < ∞, as desired.
