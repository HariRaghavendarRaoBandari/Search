Abstract

We present herein gain stabilization studies of SiPMs using a climate chamber at CERN.
We present results for four detectors not tested before, three from Hamamatsu and one from
KETEK. Two of the Hamamatsu SiPMs are novel sensors with trenches that reduce cross talk.
We use an improved readout system with a digital oscilloscope controlled with a dedicated
LabView program. We improved and automized the analysis to deal with large datasets. We
have measured the gain-versus-bias-voltage dependence at ﬁxed temperature and gain-versus-
temperature dependence at ﬁxed bias voltage to determine the bias voltage dependence on
temperature V (T ) for stable gain. We show that the gain remains stable to better than ±0.5%
in the 20◦C− 30◦C temperature range if the bias voltage is properly adjusted with temperature.

Introduction

The gain of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) [1–3] increases with bias voltage (Vbias) and decreases
with temperature (T). For stable operation, the gain needs to be kept constant, especially in large
detector systems such as an analog hadron calorimeter operating of the order of 106 SiPMs [4]. The
method for keeping the gain constant consists of adjusting Vbias when T changes. This, however,
requires knowledge of dV /dT , which can be extracted from measurements of the gain-versus-bias-
voltage (dG/dV) dependence and that of the gain versus temperature (dG/dT). Within the AIDA
framework, we measured dG/dV and dG/dT for 17 SiPMs from three manufacturers (Hamamatsu,
KETEK, CPTA) in a climate chamber at CERN. The goal was to demonstrate gain stability within
±0.5% for individual SiPMs within the 20◦C − 30◦C temperature range. Thus, we selected four
of the 17 SiPMs and demonstrated gain stabilization to < ±0.5% for these [5]. In the AIDA2020
framework, we want to show that with one bias voltage adjustment the gain of several similar SiPMs
can be kept stable. The goal is to implement the temperature-dependent bias voltage adjustment
into the power distribution system of the analo g hadron calorimeter [6].

In August 2015, we conducted our ﬁrst set of measurements within the AIDA2020 framework
using a new, improved readout system. We performed dG/dV and dG/dT measurements for several
SiPMs we previously tested as well as for a couple of novel Hamamatsu SiPMs with trenches.
For gain stabilization, we focused ﬁrst on SiPMs we did not test previously using the same Vbias
regulator board as before. We also wanted to crosscheck the CPTA sensors since their photoelectron
spectra contained much more background. One complication with the CPTA sensors is that they
are mounted to a scintillator tile and we had to inject light through the tile and not directly to the
SiPM. We built a setup to test two SiPMs simultaneously. Unfortunately, one channel did not work
properly due to an unreliable performance of one preampliﬁer.

2 Gain Calibration Test Setup

Figure 1 (left) shows our measurement setup in the climate chamber Spiral3 from Climats at CERN.
Two SiPMs, mounted inside a black box in the climate chamber, were connected to two diﬀerent
preampliﬁers, one voltage-operational two-stage preampliﬁer (8/25 ns) and one current-operational
one-stage preampliﬁer (2/7 ns). Since only the voltage-operational preampliﬁer performed properly
at all temperatures between 1◦C and 50◦C, we could use only that one for gain stability studies.
One PT1000 temperature sensor was placed close to each SiPM, a third PT1000 sensor was attached
to the wall of the black box, a fourth was ﬁxed inside the black box and a ﬁfth was used to monitor
the temperature inside the climate chamber. The climate chamber shows a temperature oﬀset of
+0.5◦C that remains unchanged over the entire 1◦C to 50◦C temperature range. However, for scans
with increasing temperatures the oﬀset is positive while for those with decreasing temperature it
is negative.
In the gain stability tests, we typically went from low to high temperatures. After
reaching equilibrium, the temperature remains stable within ∼ ±0.2◦C. The SiPMs are illuminated
simultaneously with blue light transported from an LED via an optical ﬁber and a mirror inside the
black box. The LED was trigged by a light pulser placed outside the climate chamber to reduce noise
pickup. The light pulser signal is based on a sinusoidal pulse above a selected threshold producing 3.6
ns wide signals. The repetition rate and light intensity are adjustable. We run at 10 kHz. We record
SiPM waveforms directly with a digital oscilloscope from LeCroy (model 6104, 12 bit ADC, 2.5 GS/s,
4 channels). Oﬄine, we convert the waveforms into photoelectron spectra after subtracting a DC
oﬀset and integrating 50000 waveforms over a 74 ns wide time window. The photoelectron spectra
typically show well-separated individual photoelectron (pe) peaks. We wrote a dedicated LabView
program for data taking, setting the intensity of the light pulser and controlling the bias voltages
of the SiPMs. The low voltages of the preampliﬁer are set manually and the temperature proﬁles

from 5◦C to 45◦C in steps of 5◦C. In the 20◦ − 30◦C temperature range we reduced the step size to
2◦C. Figure 1 (right) shows a typical temperature proﬁle used in the gain stabilization studies. The
properties of the SiPMs we tested are listed in Table 1.

3 Gain Determination
Figure 2 (left) shows a typical waveform for Hamamatsu MPPC B2 at 25◦C. Figure 2 (right) shows
the corresponding photoelectron spectrum. We ﬁt the pe spectrum using the likelihood function:

50000(cid:89)

L =

fsFsig(wi) + (1 − fs)Fbkg(wi),

(1)

n=1

where fs is the signal fraction. For signal, we model the probability density function (PDF) with
three Gaussians, one for the pedestal, one for the ﬁrst pe peak and another for the second pe peak:

Fsig = fpedGped + f1G1 + (1 − f1 − fped)G2.

(2)

The background PDF is parameterized by a sensitive nonlinear iterative peak (SNIP) clipping algo-
rithm that is implemented in the ROOT T-spectrum class. Background is produced by noise, dark
rate, crosstalk and afterpulsing. The latter originates from pulses triggered by a previous avalanche.
Since these pulses are delayed with respect to the original signal, their charge is integrated only
partially due to the ﬁxed integration window. We perform binned ﬁts of the spectra, which have at
least two visible photoelectron peaks plus the pedestal. The gain is determined from the distance

between the ﬁrst and second photoelectron peaks. This method is more reliable than using the dis-
tance between the pedestal and the ﬁrst photoelectron peak, which is often smaller than the distance
between ﬁrst and second photoelectron peaks. The statistical error on the gain is obtained from
2. The parameters
of three Gaussian functions are not constrained in the ﬁt. At higher bias voltage, the photoelectron
spectra show more background while for similar bias voltage the spectra at 5◦C and 45◦C look
similar as those at 25◦C.

4 Measurements for the Hamamatsu SiPM B2
The SiPM B2 sensor is a 1 mm× 1 mm SiPM with a pitch of 15 µm. The nominal operation voltage
at 25◦C is Vbias = 73.99 V.

4.1 Determination of dG/dV , dG/dT and dV /dT

First, we measure the gain-versus-bias-voltage dependence at ﬁxed temperatures in 0.1 V steps
recording 50000 waveforms at each point. We typically scan over a ±1.5 V region symmetrically
around the recommended operational bias voltage at the selected temperature. At each temperature,
we ﬁt the measurements with a linear function to extract the slope dG/dV and the oﬀset. The
latter is a linear extrapolation of the break-down voltage Vbreak. Figure 3 (left) shows the results
for SiPM B2 with ﬁts overlaid. All ﬁt curves are nearly parallel. Figure 4 (left) and (middle)
show Vbreak and dG/dV as a function of temperature, respectively. For SiPM B2, both quantities
increase linearly with temperature. Note that dG/dV is proportional to the capacitance of the SiPM
indicating that the capacitance increases with temperature, which was reported previously [8]. In
the 5◦C− 45◦C temperature range, the eﬀect is about 2%. At the nominal bias voltage, we measure
dG/dV = (2.202 ± 0.004stat) × 106/V. Next, we determine the gain-versus-temperature dependence
for ﬁxed bias voltage. The gain decreases with temperature. For each value of Vbias, we ﬁt a linear
function to the data to extract dG/dT . Figure 3 (right) depicts our measurements for SiPM B2 with
ﬁt results overlaid. Figure 4 (right) shows the resulting dG/dT values as a function of bias voltage.
The data reveal a linear dependence on Vbias. The variation is 11% in the 5◦ − 45◦C temperature
range. At 25◦C, the ﬁt yields dG/dT = −(0.12804± 0.00001)× 106/◦C. Dividing dG/dT by dG/dV
at 25◦C, yields dV /dT = 58.15 ± 0.1mV/◦C. This value is slightly smaller than the speciﬁcation

To estimate the measurement systematic uncertainties, we
combine all dG/dV and dG/dT measurements at a given temperature and determine mean value
dV /dT and its standard deviation. We ﬁt the resulting dV /dT values and their uncertainties with
a uniform distribution to determine the overall mean (cid:104)dV /dT(cid:105). Figure 5 (left) shows the resulting
(cid:104)dV /dT(cid:105) distribution. The ﬁt yields (cid:104)dV /dT(cid:105) = −57.9 ± 0.5mV/◦C. From this, we estimate a gain

4.2 Analytical Determination of Vbias versus Temperature

The V(T) distribution can be calculated analytically. The gain G(T, V ) is a function of temperature
and bias voltage. Thus, a gain change is given by:

For stable gain,dG = 0 yielding

Our measurements indicate linear dependences for dG/dV and dG/dT . So we can parameterize
these distributions by

For SiPM B2, we measure a = (−0.48266±0.00002)×106, b = 4835.9±0.3, c = (2.169±0.0004)×106
and d = 1295±152. Figure 5 (right) shows the resulting V (T ) function in the 0◦C−50◦C temperature
range, which is well approximated by a linear function.

4.3 Gain Stabilization

The bias voltage regulator board was built in Prague after thorough tests of a prototype in our
previous gain stabilization studies at CERN. Using a compensation of 58 mV /◦C, the gain stability
of SiPM B2 was tested for 13 temperature points in 5◦C − 45◦C temperature range. At each
temperature point, ten samples with 50000 waveforms each were recorded. Figure 6 (left) shows
the individual measurements at each temperature point while Fig. 6 (right) shows the average over
the ten measurements plus its standard deviation. A ﬁt with a linear function yields an oﬀset of
(4.73 ± 0.01) × 106 and a slope of 527 ± 2091. In the 5◦C − 45◦C temperature range, the gain is
rather uniform. The deviation from uniformity is less than ±0.1%, which is much smaller than the
anticipated gain stability of ±0.5% in the 20◦ − 30◦C temperature range.

5 Measurements for the Hamamatsu SiPMs LCT4

We also tested two novel Hamamatsu SiPMs with trenches, LCT4#6 and LCT4#9.
In these
1 mm × 1 mm SiPMs with 50 µm pitch, the cross talk is reduced, leading in turn to reduced
noise rates. The operation voltage at 25◦C is Vbias = 54 V. For example, Fig. 7 (left) shows a
typical waveform for SiPMs LCT4#6. The waveform indicates that noise and dark rate are at a
low level. Figure 7 (right) shows the corresponding photoelectron spectrum. Individual pe peaks
are well separated. A comparison with the pe spectrum of SiPM B2 (Fig. 2) clearly demonstrates

1Note that the gain is given in arbitrary units since the gain of the preampliﬁer is unknown.

that for SiPM with trenches dark rates are substantially lower. The photoelectron peaks lie on a
nearly uniform background. We perform a similar analysis as that for SiPM B2, measuring the
gain versus bias voltage at ﬁxed temperatures and then determining the gain versus temperature at
ﬁxed bias voltage. Figures 8 (left) and (right) depict the measurements with ﬁt functions overlaid,
respectively. The ﬁt curves for the gain-versus-bias-voltage dependence at diﬀerent temperatures
are quasi parallel. Similarly, we observe nearly parallel ﬁt curves for the gain-versus-temperature
dependence at diﬀerent Vbias.

Figure 7: A typical waveform (left) and the corresponding photoelectron spectrum (right) for SiPM
LCT4#6.

For LCT4#6 at 25◦C, we obtain dG/dV = (10.935 ± 0.005) × 106/V. For the nominal bias
voltage at 25◦C, we extract dG/dT = −(0.57705 ± 0.00003) × 106/◦C. Figures 9 left), (middle) and
(right) show the temperature dependence of Vbreak and dG/dV and the bias voltage dependence of
dG/dT , respectively. The break-down voltage increases linearly with temperature. In the 5◦C−45◦C
temperature range, the capacitance dG/dV is constant within ±0.6%. The slope dG/dT rises with
bias voltage before leveling oﬀ around 53.5 V. The entire increase is about 12% in the 5◦C − 45◦C
temperature range. To determine dV /dT , we extract ten individual values from diﬀerent dG/dV
and dG/dT combinations at each temperature, which we average. Figure 10 (left) shows the dV /dT
values as a function of temperature, which is distributed rather uniformly. A ﬁt yields the overall
average value of (cid:104)dV /dT(cid:105) = 53.9 ± 0.5 mV/◦C. The corresponding measurements for LCT4#9 are

54.0 ± 0.7 mV/◦C. The dV /dT results are 10% lower than the speciﬁcation of 60.0 mV/◦C from
Hamamatsu. The analytic solution yields a nearly linear dependence as shown in Fig. 10 (right). The
ﬁt yields a = (−1.52646±0.00009)×106, b = 17644±2, c = (11.004±0.005)×106, and d = 2749±192

d = 1130 ± 170 for LCT4#9.
We performed the gain stabilization with dV /dT = 60 mV /◦C as given by Hamamatsu. Figure 11
shows the gain-versus-temperature dependence after stabilization for SiPM LCT4#6 (left) using a
continuous temperature scan and for LCT4#9 using a stepwise temperature scan (right). The gain is
rising with temperature. Up to ∼ 35◦C, the rise is linear. Above ∼ 40◦C, a deviation from linearity
is visible. In the 20◦C− 30◦C temperature range, the deviation from uniformity is ±1.2%. This is a
somewhat larger than our requirement. Thus, we tested the gain stabilization of these SiPMs with
the correct slope in a new study at CERN in February 2016.

6 Measurements of KETEK SiPMs
Besides Hamamatsu SiPMs, we tested sensors from KETEK and CPTA. The CPTA SiPMs (1 mm×
1 mm with a pitch of 40 µm) were glued to a wavelength-shifting ﬁber inserted into a groove milled
into a 3 mm thick and 3 cm × 3 cm wide scintillator tile. This made the light injection challenging.
We cleared the wrapping near the SiPM to inject light close to the sensor. Since the photoelectron
spectra have larger background than those of other SiPMs, they are much harder to ﬁt. Thus, the

analysis is still ongoing.
The KETEK SiPM, W12, is 3 mm × 3 mm experimental sensors with a pitch of 20 µm. The
nominal operation voltage is Vbias = 28 V at 25◦C. We perform a similar analysis as before. Fig-
ure 12 (left) shows the gain-versus-bias-voltage dependence at ﬁxed temperatures. The ﬁts yield
nearly parallel lines. Figure 12 (right) shows the gain-versus-temperature dependence at ﬁxed bias
voltage. Some ﬁt curves are slightly non-parallel. This reﬂects a larger overall systematic uncer-
tainty. Figure 13 (left) and (middle) show the breakdown voltage and dG/dV versus temperature,
respectively. The latter variable rises linearly with temperature. The deviation from constant capac-
itance is 5% from 5◦C to 45◦C. Figure 13 (right) shows dG/dT versus bias voltage, which increases
with bias voltage. The variation from low to high bias voltages is 23%. At 25◦C, we measure
dG/dV = (2.9293 ± 0.0004) × 106/V and dG/dT = −(0.25336 ± 0.0004) × 106/◦C. Again, we aver-
age ten dV /dT points at each temperature and ﬁt the resulting gain distribution shown in Fig. 14

ment of (cid:104)dV /dT(cid:105) = 21.29 ± 0.08 mV/◦C obtained in a previous study. Figure 14 (right) shows
the analytical solution for V (T ). The curve is obtained with a = −226823 ± 32, b = 6297.4 ± 1.7,
c = (2.9231 ± 0.008) × 106 and d = 3792 ± 389.
Since we had not extracted (cid:104)dV /dT(cid:105) before the gain stabilization study, we used the slope of
21 mV/◦C from a previous study [5]. Figure 15 shows the gain versus temperature dependence

after stabilization. The distribution shows a linear increase with temperature to about 35◦C. In
the 0◦ − 35◦C temperature range, the overcompensation is about ±2.8% yielding a deviation from
stability of ±0.8% in the 20◦C − 30◦ C temperature range. Above 35◦C, the gain starts dropping.
According to the KETEK data sheet, the SiPMs should be operated at temperatures between −30◦C
to +40◦C. So data above +35◦C are not stable. Since the deviation from uniformity lies outside our
speciﬁcation, we remeasured the gain stabilization with the correct (cid:104)dV /dT(cid:105) value in the second test
at CERN in February 2016.

7 Studies of Afterpulsing

The SiPM pulse has a very fast rise time and a rather long decay time. The decay time depends on the
intrinsic properties of the SiPM (quenching resistor, capacitance) and properties of the preampliﬁer.
The quenching resistor terminates the avalanche formation to get the detector ready for the next
signal. In this process, however, a new avalanche may be triggered called afterpulse that aﬀects the
shape of the waveform on the decay time. The probability for afterpulses depends on the internal
properties of the SiPM. Since afterpulses are delayed with respect to the original signal, their charge
is only partially integrated over. This leads to photoelectron spectra with decreased resolution.
In order to measure the size of afterpulsing, we compare photoelectron spectra obtained with two
diﬀerent methods. First, we determine the photoelectron spectrum from the measured total charge
Qtot by integrating the waveform over a ﬁxed time window. Second, we extract the photoelectron
spectrum from the magnitude of the waveform peak Apeak. Figure 16 (left) shows the scatter plot

of Qtot versus Apeak for SiPM B2 at 25◦C for the nominal bias voltage of 74.9 V. The signal without
afterpulsing lies on the diagonal. This is the main contribution at this bias voltage. Waveforms with
afterpulses shift Qtot upwards due to the additional charge. Thus, we deﬁne a separation line shown
by the dashed line in Figure 16 (left). The slope is obtained from the separation of the second and
third photoelectron peaks in two dimensions, ∆y/∆x. To achieve the best separation between the
two regions, the position of the line is chosen at the minimum value between the two regions as
shown in Fig. 16 (right). To determine the fraction of afterpulsing, we count all events above the
dashed line and normalize them to the total number of events. In order to test if the determination
of dV /dT depends on afterpulsing, we redo the analysis for all events and those above the dashed
line. Figures 17 (top left) and (top right) show dG/dV versus temperature for all waveforms and
those with reduced afterpulsing. Figures 17 (bottom left) and (bottom right) show the corresponding
plots for dG/dT versus bias voltage. The dG/dV and dG/dT distributions for the two samples look
similar and the slopes both for dG/dV for dG/dT are the same within errors.

To determine the afterpulsing fraction for LCT4 SiPMs, we analyze scatter plots of photoelectron
spectra for Qtot versus Apeak for diﬀerent temperatures and bias voltages. Figure 18 shows the scatter
plot for LCT4#6 at 25◦C at the nominal bias voltage. We deﬁne the afterpulsing fraction R as the
number of events above the red line to the number of all events. For diﬀerent temperatures, we
plot R as a function of the overvoltage ∆U = Vbias − Vbreak. Figure 19 shows the results for SiPM

with a second-order polynomial. However, R shows no signiﬁcant dependence on temperature. The
observed spread is consistent with the systematic uncertainty of the measurement procedure.

8 Conclusion and Outlook

In the framework of AIDA2020, we started to conduct gain stabilization studies of more SiPMs in
the climate chamber at CERN with an improved readout system using a 12-bit digital oscilloscope
controlled by LabView. We set up a readout of two SiPMs in parallel, one attached to a voltage-
operational preampliﬁer and the other to a current-operational preampliﬁer. The current-operational
preampliﬁer became unstable during the gain stabilization tests, particularly after operation at
higher temperatures producing useless results that had to be discarded. Thus, out of the eight
SiPMs we wanted to study, we could test gain stabilization only for ﬁve of them. Two are novel
SiPMs from Hamamatsu with trenches (LCT4#6, LCT4#9), one is special SiPM with 15 µm pitch
from Hamamatsu (B2), one comes from KETEK (W12) and the ﬁfth is a CPTA sensor (857). For
SiPM B2, we achieved excellent gain stabilization in entire temperature range (5◦C − 45◦C). The
deviation from stable gain is less than 1% in the entire temperature range. For SiPMs LCT4#6
and LCT4#9, we overcorrected the bias voltage by +6.1mV/◦C since we used dV /dT = 60 mV/◦C
speciﬁed by Hamamatsu instead of 53.9 mV/◦C measured in this study. This yields a deviation
from stability of ±1.2% in the 20◦C − 30◦C temperature range, which is more than a factor of two
larger than our speciﬁcation. For SiPM W12 (KETEK), we also overcorrected the bias voltage by
+4.1mV/◦C by using dV /dT = 21.3 mV/◦C instead of 17.2mV/◦C. Thus, for the LCT4 and the
W12 SiPMs the stabilization studies need to be repeated with the correct value of dV /dT . For
The CPTA SiPM, the analysis is still in progress. Dedicated studies of afterpulsing show that gain
stabilization is not aﬀected by afterpulsing. We also observe that afterpulsing rises quadratically
with the applied overvoltage but is quasi independent of temperature.

Learning from our experience in August, we carefully planned for a new 10 day stabilization study
in the climate chamber at CERN for the middle of February 2016. We improved our setup to test
four SiPMs simultaneously with one bias voltage adjustment using four similar voltage-operational
preampliﬁers. We transferred light from the LED via individual ﬁbers to each SiPM. For each
stabilization run, we took measurements at 20 or more temperatures points between 1◦C − 50◦C

with four selected similar SiPMs. We performed gain stabilization with 30 SiPMS. From our online
analysis we know that all SiPMs performed well meeting our requirements except for two CPTA
sensors. The results will be ﬁnalized and published soon. We now have suﬃcient information to
implement a temperature-dependent bias voltage adjustment into the power distribution system of
an analog hadron calorimeter.
