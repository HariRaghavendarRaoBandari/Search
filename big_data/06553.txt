Abstract

Let r be a positive integer, and let A be a nonempty ﬁnite set of at least two integers. We
let ˜Cr(A) denote the asymptotic r-covering number of A, that is, the smallest integer value of
l for which, for all suﬃciently large positive integers h, the rh-fold sumset of A is contained in
at most l translates of the h-fold sumset of A. Nathanson proved that ˜Cr(A) is always at most
r + 1; here we extend this result to prove that ˜Cr(A) is always at least r, and determine all sets
A for which ˜Cr(A) = r.

Introduction

We start by recalling some standard terms and notations. Let A be a nonempty ﬁnite set of integers.
If for some integers a and b with a ≤ b, A consists of all integers between a and b, inclusive, we say
that A is an interval and write A = [a, b]; more generally, if for integers a, d, and m with d > 0 and
m > 0, A consists of all integers of the form a + id with i = 0, 1, . . . , m − 1, we say that A is an
arithmetic progression of common diﬀerence d, ﬁrst term a, and size m.

For integers x and c, we deﬁne the translate of A by x as

and the c-fold dilate of A as

A + x = {a + x | a ∈ A}

c · A = {c · a | a ∈ A}.

For example, an arithmetic progression of common diﬀerence d, ﬁrst term a, and size m can be
written as d · [0, m − 1] + a.

We deﬁne the sumset of nonempty sets A1, A2, . . . , Ah of integers by

A1 + A2 + · · · + Ah = {a1 + a2 + · · · + ah | ai ∈ Ai for i = 1, 2, . . . , h};

if Ai = A for all i = 1, 2, . . . , h, we denote this sumset by hA and call it the h-fold sumset of A.
(Note that h · A ⊆ hA, but this is usually a proper containment.)

Let r and l be positive integers. Nathanson [5] deﬁnes A to be an (r, l)-approximate group, if
the r-fold sumset of A is contained in the union of l translates of A; that is, if there exists a set X
consisting of l integers for which rA ⊆ A + X. Note that any (r, l)-approximate group is an (r, l′)-
approximate group for every integer l′ ≥ l. It is, therefore, of interest to ﬁnd the smallest integer l
for which A is an (r, l)-approximate group; we here deﬁne this value as the r-covering number of A
and denote it by Cr(A). Since rA is a ﬁnite set, Cr(A) is well-deﬁned.

We make some trivial observations. If r = 1, then rA = A, so A is a (1, l)-approximate group
for any l; in particular, C1(A) = 1. Also, when |A| = 1, then |rA| = 1, so A is an (r, l)-approximate
group for every r and l, and Cr(A) = 1. For these reasons, below we assume that r ≥ 2 and |A| ≥ 2.

Let us consider two examples.

Example 1 Let a1 and a2 be any two distinct integers, and set A = {a1, a2}. Then

rA = {(r − i)a1 + ia2 | i = 0, 1, . . . , r}

⊆ A + {(r − 1 − i)a1 + ia2 | i = 0, 2, 4, . . . , 2⌈(r − 1)/2⌉},

and so Cr(A) ≤ ⌈(r + 1)/2⌉. (It is easy to see that equality holds here. In Section 2 we shall prove
that Cr(A) ≥ ⌈(r + 1)/2⌉ for any set A.)

Example 2 Let a1, a2, . . . , am be positive integers so that ai+1 > rai for i = 1, 2, . . . , m − 1, and

set A = {a1, a2, . . . , am}. Then

|rA| = (cid:18)m + r − 1
(cid:19),

r

so we see that A cannot be an (r, l)-approximate group for any l < (cid:0)m+r−1

ﬁnd that, for any pair of positive integers r and l (with r ≥ 2), there are ﬁnite sets of integers A
with Cr(A) > l.

r

(cid:1)/m. In particular, we

As these two examples demonstrate, the r-covering number of sets may vary widely. We observe
a much more subdued behavior if we consider sets ‘asymptotically’. Namely, Nathanson [5] deﬁnes
A to be an asymptotic (r, l)-approximate group, if there is an integer h0 so that hA is an (r, l)-
approximate group for every integer h ≥ h0. The main result of [5] is as follows.

Theorem 1 (Nathanson; cf. [5]) Every nonempty ﬁnite set of integers is an asymptotic (r, r+1)-
approximate group.

We extend this result by establishing the following.

Theorem 2 Let A = {a1, a2, . . . , am} be a set of (at least two) integers so that a1 < a2 · · · < am,
and set

d = gcd(a2 − a1, a3 − a1, . . . , am − a1).

2

1. If A is an asymptotic (r, l)-approximate group, then l ≥ r.

2. If A is an asymptotic (r, r)-approximate group, then a2 = a1 + d and am = am−1 + d.

Analogously to the r-covering number Cr(A) of A introduced above, we deﬁne the asymptotic r-
covering number of A as the smallest positive integer l for which A is an asymptotic (r, l)-approximate
group; we denote this quantity by ˜Cr(A). We may summarize Theorems 1 and 2 as follows.

Corollary 3 Let A be any set of (at least two) integers. Keeping the notations of Theorem 2, we
have

r

if a2 = a1 + d and am = am−1 + d;

˜Cr(A) = 


r+1

otherwise.

Contrasting our two examples above with Corollary 3 we can point out that, for any ﬁxed r, the
r-covering number Cr(A) may take up inﬁnitely many diﬀerent values (depending on A), while its
asymptotic version, ˜Cr(A), can only equal r or r + 1.

Approximate groups were introduced by Tao in [7], and have been investigated extensively since;
see, for example, papers by Breuillard [1]; Breuillard, Green, and Tao [2]; Green [3]; Sanders [6]; and
their references.

2 Approximate groups of integers

We will use the following version of a well-known result.

Lemma 4 Let h be a positive integer and A be a set of integers. If A is an arithmetic progression,
then |hA| = hm − h + 1, otherwise |hA| ≥ hm.

Proof: The ﬁrst part of our claim is obvious. The second part is obvious as well for h = 1, and
it is well-known for h = 2: in fact, more generally, we know that, when A1 and A2 are nonempty
ﬁnite sets of size at least two and at least one of them is not an arithmetic progression, then
|A1 + A2| ≥ |A1| + |A2| (see, for example, Lemma 1.3 and Theorem 1.3 in [4]). Suppose then that
our claim holds for A and some positive integer k, and consider (k + 1)A. Since both A and kA have
size at least two, we have

|(k + 1)A| = |kA + A| ≥ |kA| + |A| ≥ km + m = (k + 1)m,

thus our claim holds for all h by induction. ✷

Proposition 5 Let r and l be positive integers and A be an (r, l)-approximate group of size m. We
then have l ≥ (rm − r + 1)/m; in fact, if A is not an arithmetic progression, then l ≥ r.

Proof: Suppose that X is a set of l integers so that rA ⊆ A + X. Then

|rA| ≤ |A + X| ≤ |A| · |X| = ml.

The result now follows from Lemma 4. ✷

3

Proposition 6 Let r be a positive integer. If A is an arithmetic progression of size m, then A is
an (r, l)-approximate group for every l ≥ (rm − r + 1)/m; therefore,

In particular, we have Cr(A) ≤ r for any arithmetic progression A.

Cr(A) = ⌈(rm − r + 1)/m⌉.

Proof: Let a and d be integers such that A = a + d · [0, m − 1]. Set

If l ≥ (rm − r + 1)/m, then

and thus

X = (r − 1)a + md · [0, l − 1].

(m − 1) + (l − 1)m ≥ r(m − 1),

rA = ra + d · [0, r(m − 1)]

⊆ ra + d · [0, (m − 1) + (l − 1)m]

= (a + d · [0, m − 1]) + ((r − 1)a + md · [0, l − 1])
= A + X,

which implies the result. ✷

Theorem 7 Let r be an integer so that r ≥ 2, and let A be a ﬁnite set of integers of size m ≥ 2.
Then

Cr(A) ≥ ⌈(r + 1)/2⌉.

Furthermore, equality holds if, and only if

• m = 2 (and thus A is an arithmetic progression), or

• r = 2 and A is an arithmetic progression (of any size), or

• r = 4 and A is an arithmetic progression of size three.

Proof: If A is an arithmetic progression, then Cr(A) is given by Proposition 6; the veriﬁcation

of our claims is an easy exercise.

When A is not an arithmetic progression, then by Proposition 5 we have Cr(A) ≥ r ≥ ⌈(r+1)/2⌉;
it remains to be shown that at least one of the inequalities is strict. If this were not the case, then
we would have r = 2, so we only need to verify that if A is not an arithmetic progression, then it
cannot be a (2, 2)-approximate group. This was done as part of Theorem 3 in [4]; for the sake of
completeness, we repeat the short proof here.

Suppose, indirectly, that 2A ⊆ A + X for some set X of size two. This implies that |2A| ≤ 2m,
so by Lemma 4, we must have |2A| = 2m and thus 2A = A + X. But then min 2A = min(A + X),
where min 2A = 2 · min A and min(A + X) = min A + min X. Therefore, min A = min X; similarly,
max A = max X. This implies that

min A + max X = max A + min X,

4

but then |2A| = |A + X| ≤ 2m − 1, a contradiction. This completes our proof. ✷

Regarding absolute upper bounds on r-covering numbers, we recall Example 2 to state that there

are none.

Proposition 8 Let r be an integer so that r ≥ 2. Then for every positive integer l, there exists a
nonempty ﬁnite set A of integers so that Cr(A) ≥ l.

3 Asymptotic arithmetic progressions of integers

As we have seen, arithmetic progressions play a central role when studying approximate groups
of integers.
In this section, as preparation for the study of asymptotic approximate groups, we
investigate the ‘asymptotic’ version of arithmetic sequences. We call a subset A of integers an
asymptotic arithmetic progression, if hA is an arithmetic progression for all suﬃciently large h.

Our main result about asymptotic arithmetic progressions is as follows.

Theorem 9 Let A = {a1, a2, . . . , am} be a set of (at least two) integers so that a1 < a2 · · · < am,
and set

d = gcd(a2 − a1, a3 − a1, . . . , am − a1).

The following statements are equivalent.

1. There is a positive integer h0 for which h0A is an arithmetic progression.

2. There is a positive integer h0 for which hA is an arithmetic progression for every integer

h ≥ h0.

3. a2 = a1 + d and am = am−1 + d.

Before our proof, we recall that each nonempty ﬁnite set of integers can be ‘normalized’: the
normal form of the set A = {a1, a2, . . . , am} is the set B = {b1 = 0, b2, . . . , bm} deﬁned by bi =
(ai − a1)/d for i = 1, 2, . . . , m, where

Note that A = d · B + a1.

d = gcd(a2 − a1, a3 − a1, . . . , am − a1).

Lemma 10 Let A be a nonempty ﬁnite set of integers, and let B be its normal form. Then for any
positive integer h, hA is an arithmetic progression if, and only if, hB is an arithmetic progression.

Proof: Note that hA is an arithmetic progression if, and only if, hA − ha1 is an arithmetic
progression, and hB is an arithmetic progression if, and only if, d · hB is an arithmetic progression.

5

Since

hA − ha1 = {Σm
= {Σm
= {Σm
= d · {Σm
= d · hB,

i=1hiai − ha1 | Σhi = h}
i=1(hiai − hia1) | Σhi = h}
i=1dhibi | Σhi = h}

i=1hibi | Σhi = h}

the result follows. ✷

Proof of Theorem 9: We follow the scheme 1 ⇒ 3 ⇒ 2 ⇒ 1; since 2 ⇒ 1 is trivially true, we only

need to establish the ﬁrst two implications.

Suppose that h0A is an arithmetic progression for some positive integer h0. By Lemma 10, we

may assume that A is in normal form, so we need to prove that a2 = 1 and am = am−1 + 1.

Note that ai ∈ h0A for every i = 1, 2, . . . , m; in particular, the smallest element of h0A is a1 = 0,
and its smallest positive element is a2. Therefore, if h0A is an arithmetic progression, then each of its
elements must be divisible by a2. In particular, ai is divisible by a2 for every i = 1, 2, . . . , m. Since
A is in normal form, this implies that a2 = 1. This means that h0A is an arithmetic progression
with a common diﬀerence of 1.

Observe also that the largest element of h0A is h0am, and the second-largest element is (h0 −
1)am + am−1. Since h0A is an arithmetic progression with a common diﬀerence of 1, we have
h0am = (h0 − 1)am + am−1 + 1 and thus am = am−1 + 1.

Suppose now that we have a set A with a2 = a1 + d and am = am−1 + d. Then the normal form

of A is the set B of the form

for some integers 1 < b3 < · · · < bm−2 < b − 1. We shall prove that

B = {0, 1, b3, . . . , bm−2, b − 1, b}

hB = {0, 1, 2, . . . , hb}

for every h ≥ b − 2; by Lemma 10, this implies that hA is an arithmetic progression for every integer
h ≥ b − 2. Since min hB = 0 and max hB = hb, it suﬃces to prove that [0, hb] ⊆ hB.

Let h ≥ b − 2, let 0 ≤ k ≤ h, and let 0 ≤ j ≤ k. Note that the integer

(k − j) · (b − 1) + j · b

is an element of kB, so the interval [k(b − 1), kb] is contained in kB. But 0 ∈ B, so kB ⊆ hB, and
thus [k(b − 1), kb] ⊆ hB.

Now let 0 ≤ t ≤ h − k. Note that the integer

(h − k − t) · 0 + t · 1 + k · b

is an element of hB, and thus the interval [kb, kb + h − k] is contained in hB. Combining this with
the previous paragraph, we conclude that, for every integer 0 ≤ k ≤ h, hB contains the interval
[k(b − 1), kb + h − k].

But, since h ≥ b − 2,

kb + h − k ≥ (k + 1)(b − 1) − 1,

6

we have

as claimed. ✷

[0, hb] = [0(b − 1), hb + h − h] = ∪h

k=0[k(b − 1), kb + h − k] ⊆ hB,

4 Asymptotic approximate groups of integers

We start by proving that, in contrast to the r-covering number Cr(A) of a set A, which may be less
than r, the asymptotic r-covering number ˜Cr(A) of A (of size at least two) is always at least r.

Theorem 11 Let A be any set of integers of ﬁnite size at least two, and let r and l be positive
integers. If A is an asymptotic (r, l)-approximate group, then l ≥ r.

Proof: Suppose, indirectly, that l < r. Let m = |A| ≥ 2, h be a positive integer, and suppose

that hA is an (r, l)-approximate group. Let X be a set of l integers for which rhA ⊆ hA + X.

We then have

since, by Lemma 4,

we get

|rhA| ≤ |hA| · l;

|rhA| = |r(hA)| ≥ r · |hA| − r + 1,

|hA| ≤

r − 1
r − l

.

But, again by Lemma 4, |hA| ≥ hm − h + 1, so

or

hm − h + 1 ≤

r − 1
r − l

,

h ≤

l − 1

(r − l)(m − 1)

.

This implies that there can only be ﬁnitely many values of h for which hA is an (r, l)-approximate
group, which is a contradiction. ✷

In the rest of this section, we characterize sets with asymptotic r-covering number equal to r.

We ﬁrst reduce the problem to sets in normal form via the following lemma.

Lemma 12 Let A be a nonempty ﬁnite set of integers, and let B be its normal form. Then, for
any pair of positive integers r and l, A is an (r, l)-approximate group if, and only if, B is an (r, l)-
approximate group.

Proof: Suppose ﬁrst that B is an (r, l)-approximate group, and let X be a set of l integers for

which rB ⊆ B + X. Recall that, with a1 = min A and

d = gcd(a2 − a1, . . . , am − a1),

7

we have A = d · B + a1, and thus

rA = r(d · B + a1) = d · rB + ra1 ⊆ d · (B + X) + ra1 = d · B + d · X + ra1 = A + d · X + (r − 1)a1.

Here d · X + (r − 1)a1 is a set of l integers, which implies that A is an (r, l)-approximate group.

Conversely, assume that A is an (r, l)-approximate group; let A = {a1, a2, . . . , am} with a1 and
d deﬁned as above. The covering number Cr(A) of A is at most l; let X be a set of exactly Cr(A)
integers for which rA ⊆ A + X.

First, we prove that, for every x ∈ X, the integer x − (r − 1)a1 is divisible by d. There must be

an element c ∈ rA for which c ∈ A + x, since otherwise we would have

rA ⊆ A + (X \ {x}),

contradicting |X| = Cr(A). Suppose then that nonnegative integers 1 ≤ j ≤ m and h1, h2, . . . , hm
are such that Σm

i=1hi = r and

c = Σm

i=1hiai = aj + x.

Then

x − (r − 1)a1 = Σm

i=1hiai − ra1 − (aj − a1) = Σm

i=1hi(ai − a1) − (aj − a1),

which is then divisible by d since ai − a1 is divisible by d for every i = 1, 2, . . . , m.

Let

as we just proved, Y is a set of Cr(A) integers. Furthermore,

Y = {(x − (r − 1)a1)/d | x ∈ X};

d · rB = r(d · B + a1) − ra1 = rA − ra1 ⊆ A + X − ra1 = d · B + X − (r − 1)a1 = d · B + d · Y,

so rB ⊆ B + Y . Since |Y | = Cr(A) ≤ l, we can conclude that B is an (r, l)-approximate group, as
claimed. ✷

For the proof of Theorem 14 below, we employ the following result, sometimes referred to as the

Fundamental Theorem of Additive Number Theory.

Theorem 13 (Nathanson; cf. Theorem 1.1 in [4]) Suppose that A is a nonempty ﬁnite set of
integers in normal form and max A = am. Then there are nonnegative integers h0, c, and d, so that
hA contains the interval [c, ham − d] for every integer h ≥ h0.

For easier reference, we state our characterization of sets with ˜Cr(A) = r in the following form.

Theorem 14 Let A = {a1, a2, . . . , am} be a set of (at least two) integers so that a1 < a2 · · · < am,
and set

d = gcd(a2 − a1, a3 − a1, . . . , am − a1).

Let r be any positive integer. The following statements are equivalent.

1. A is an asymptotic (r, r)-approximate group.

2. A is an asymptotic arithmetic progression.

8

3. a2 = a1 + d and am = am−1 + d.

Proof: We follow the scheme 1 ⇒ 3 ⇒ 2 ⇒ 1. The implication 3 ⇒ 2 was already established in
Theorem 9. Furthermore, if A is an asymptotic arithmetic progression, that is, if hA is an arithmetic
progression for all suﬃciently large integers h, then for these h values hA is an (r, r)-approximate
group by Proposition 6, proving the implication 2 ⇒ 1. Therefore, we only need to prove that 1 ⇒ 3.

Suppose then that A is an asymptotic (r, r)-approximate group; by Lemma 12 we may assume
that A is in normal form. Our goal is to prove that a1 = 1 and am = am−1 + 1. We shall ﬁrst prove
that a2 = 1.

Suppose, indirectly, that a2 ≥ 2. Then, by Theorem 9, there is no positive integer h for which

hA is an arithmetic progression, so, by Lemma 4, |rhA| ≥ r · |hA| holds for every h.

Now let h0, c, and d be nonnegative integers for which, by Theorem 13, rhA contains the interval

[c, rham − d] for every integer h ≥ h0/r. Then, with

we have

for every h ≥ h1.

h1 = max{h0/r, (c − 1)/am, (d + 1)/am},

[ham + 1, (r − 1)ham + 1] ⊆ rhA

Since A is an asymptotic (r, r)-approximate group, we have an integer h2 for which hA is an

(r, r)-approximate group for every integer h ≥ h2. We set

and choose h to be any integer with h ≥ h3.

h3 = max{h1, h2, r/am},

Let X be a set of r integers so that rhA ⊆ hA + X; we then have |rhA| ≤ |hA| · r. Since
above we have already established the reverse inequality, we must have |rhA| = |hA| · r, and thus
rhA = hA + X. In particular,

0 = min rhA = min(hA + X) = min hA + min X = 0 + min X,

so min X = 0; similarly, max X = (r − 1)ham. Then we can write X = {x1, x2, x3, . . . , xr−1, xr},
where

0 = x1 < x2 < x3 < · · · < xr−1 < xr = (r − 1)ham.

Claim 1: There is at least one value of i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , r − 1} for which xi+1 − xi ≥ ham.

Proof of Claim 1: This follows from the fact that

Σr−1

i=1 (xi+1 − xi) = xr − x1 = (r − 1)ham.

Claim 2: For all values of i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , r − 1}, we have xi+1 − xi ≤ ham + 1.

Proof of Claim 2: Let us assume, to the contrary, that xi+1 − xi ≥ ham + 2 for some i. In this

case the interval

I = [xi + ham + 1, xi+1 − 1]

9

is nonempty. Note that hA + X and I are disjoint. But each element of I is at least x1 + ham + 1 =
ham + 1 and at most xr − 1 = (r − 1)ham − 1, so

I ⊆ [ham + 1, (r − 1)ham + 1] ⊆ rhA,

which contradicts our assumption that rhA = hA + X.

Claim 3: There is no value of i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , r − 1} for which xi+1 − xi = ham.

Proof of Claim 3:

If, to the contrary, we were to have xi+1 − xi = ham for some i, then
xi+1 + 1 = xi + ham + 1 would not be generated. Since this integer is at least ham + 1 and at most
(r − 1)ham + 1, we get a contradiction as in the proof of Claim 2.

Claim 4: There is no value of i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , r − 1} for which xi+1 − xi = 1.

Proof of Claim 4: If, to the contrary, we were to have xi+1 − xi = 1 for some value of i, then, by

Claim 2, we would have

(r − 1)ham = Σr−1

i=1 (xi+1 − xi) ≤ 1 + (r − 2)(ham + 1),

contradicting the fact that h ≥ h3 ≥ r/am.

Claim 5: xr − xr−1 6= ham + 1.

Proof of Claim 5: Suppose, indirectly, that xr − xr−1 = ham + 1 and thus xr−1 = (r − 2)ham − 1.

Since

we have

(r − 1)ham + 1 ∈ rhA = hA + X,

a := (r − 1)ham + 1 − xi ∈ hA

for some i = 1, 2, . . . , r. We cannot have i = r, since then a = 1, and 1 6∈ hA as the smallest positive
element of hA is a2 ≥ 2. Also, we cannot have i ≤ r − 1, since then

but the largest element of hA is ham. This proves our claim.

a ≥ (r − 1)ham + 1 − xr−1 = ham + 2,

According to our ﬁve claims, we then must have a value of i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , r − 2} for which

xi+1 − xi = ham + 1 and xi+2 − xi+1 ≥ 2. Consider the integer a = xi + ham + 2. We have

ham + 2 ≤ a = xi+1 + 1 ≤ xr = (r − 1)ham,

so a ∈ rhA = hA + X.

However, we show that a − X and hA are disjoint. Indeed, for all integers 0 ≤ j ≤ i, we have

a − xj ≥ ham + 2; for all i + 2 ≤ j ≤ r, we have

a − xj ≤ xi + ham + 2 − xi+2 ≤ xi + ham + 2 − (xi+1 + 2) = −1;

and a − xi+1 = 1. But

hA ⊆ {0} ∪ [2, ham],

so a − X and hA are disjoint, which is a contradiction. This proves that a2 = 1.

10

To prove that am = am−1 + 1, set C = −A + am. Then C is in normal form, and it is an
easy exercise to verify that it is also an asymptotic (r, r)-approximate group; indeed, for any integer
h ≥ h3, we have

rhC = rh(−A + am)
= −rhA + rham
⊆ −(hA + X) + rham
= h(−A + am) + (−X + (r − 1)ham)
= hC + (−X + (r − 1)ham),

where −X + (r − 1)ham is a set of r integers. But then, by our argument above, the smallest positive
element of C equals 1; that is, am − am−1 = 1. This completes our proof. ✷
