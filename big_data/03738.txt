ABSTRACT

Context. Exoplanet searches have revealed interesting correlations between the stellar properties and the occurrence rate of planets.
In particular, diﬀerent independent surveys have demonstrated that giant planets are preferentially found around metal-rich stars and
that their fraction increases with the stellar mass.
Aims. During the past six years, we have conducted a radial velocity follow-up program of 166 giant stars, to detect substellar
companions, and characterizing their orbital properties. Using this information, we aim to study the role of the stellar evolution in
the orbital parameters of the companions, and to unveil possible correlations between the stellar properties and the occurrence rate of
giant planets.
Methods. We have taken multi-epoch spectra using FEROS and CHIRON for all of our targets, from which we have computed
precision radial velocities and we have derived atmospheric and physical parameters. Additionally, velocities computed from UCLES
spectra are presented here. By studying the periodic radial velocity signals, we have detected the presence of several substellar
companions.
Results. We present four new planetary systems around the giant stars HIP8541, HIP74890, HIP84056 and HIP95124. Additionally,
we study the correlation between the occurrence rate of giant planets with the stellar mass and metallicity of our targets. We ﬁnd that
giant planets are more frequent around metal-rich stars, reaching a peak in the detection of f = 16.7+15.5
−5.9 % around stars with [Fe/H] ∼
0.35 dex. Similarly, we observe a positive correlation of the planet occurrence rate with the stellar mass, between M⋆∼ 1.0 - 2.1 M⊙ ,
with a maximum of f = 13.0+10.1
Conclusions. We conclude that giant planets are preferentially formed around metal-rich stars. Also, we conclude that they are more
eﬃciently formed around more massive stars, in the stellar mass range of ∼ 1.0 - 2.1 M⊙ . These observational results conﬁrm previous
ﬁndings for solar-type and post-MS hosting stars, and provide further support to the core-accretion formation model.

1. Introduction

Twenty years after the discovery of 51 Peg b (Mayor & Queloz
1995), we count more than 1600 conﬁrmed extrasolar planets.
In addition, there is a long list of unconﬁrmed systems from
the Kepler mission (Borucki et al. 2010), adding-up more than
5000 candidate exoplanets1 that await conﬁrmation. These plan-

etary systems have been detected around stars all across the
HR diagram, in very diﬀerent orbital conﬁgurations, and reveal-
ing interesting correlations between the stellar properties and
the orbital parameters. In particular, is it now well established
that there is a positive correlation between the stellar metal-
licity and the occurrence rate of giant planets (the so-called
‘planet-metallicity’ correlation; PMC hereafter). The PMC has
gained great acceptance in the exoplanet ﬁeld, since the metal-
content of the proto-planetary disk is a key ingredient in the
core-accretion model (Pollack et al. 1996; Alibert et al. 2004;
Ida & Lin 2004). This relationship was initially proposed by
Gonzalez et al. (1997), and has been conﬁrmed by subsequent
studies (Santos et al. 2001; Fischer & Valenti 2005; hereafter

FIS05). Moreover, by comparing the host-star metallicity of 20
sub-stellar companions from the literature with the metallicity
distribution of the Lick sample, Hekker et al.
(2007) showed
that planet-hosting stars are on average more metal rich by 0.13
± 0.03 dex, suggesting that the PMC might also be valid for
giant stars. However, recent works have obtained conﬂicting re-
sults, particularly from planet search programs focusing on post-
main-sequence (MS) stars. For instance, Pasquini et al. (2007),
based on a sample of 10 planet-hosting giant stars2, showed that
exoplanets around evolved stars are not found preferentially in
metal-rich systems, arguing that the planet-metallicity correla-
tion might be explained by an atmospheric pollution eﬀect, due
to the ingestion of iron-rich material or metal-rich giant plan-
ets (Murray & Chaboyer 2002). Similarly, Hekker et al. (2008)
showed a lack of correlation between the planet occurrence rate
and the stellar metallicity, although they included in the analy-
sis all of the giant stars with observable periodic radial velocity
(RV) variations, instead of only including those stars with se-
cure planets. Thus, it might be expected that the Hekker et al.
sample is contaminated with non-planet-hosting variable stars.
Döllinger et al.
(2009) showed that planet-hosting giant stars
from the Tautenburg survey tend to be metal-poor. In contrast,
based on a small sample of subgiant stars with M⋆> 1.4 M⊙ ,
Johnson et al. (2010; hereafter JOHN10) found that their data
are consistent with the planet-metallicity correlation observed
among dwarf stars. Also, Maldonado et al. (2013) showed that
the planet-metallicity correlation is observed in evolved stars
with M⋆> 1.5M⊙ , while for the lower mass stars this trend is
absent. Finally, based on a much larger sample analyzed in a ho-
mogeneous way, Reﬀert et al. (2015; hereafter REF15) showed
that giant planets around giant stars are preferentially formed
around metal-rich stars.

On the other hand, diﬀerent RV surveys have also shown a
direct correlation between the occurrence rate of giant planets
and the stellar mass. Johnson et al. (2007), claimed that there
is a positive correlation between the fraction of planets and stel-
lar mass. They showed that the fraction increases from f = 1.8
± 1.0 %, for stars with M⋆∼ 0.4 M⊙ to a signiﬁcantly higher
value of f = 8.9 ± 2.9 %, for stars with M⋆∼ 1.6 M⊙ . These
results were conﬁrmed by JOHN10, who showed that there is
a linear increase in the fraction of giant planets with the stellar
mass, characterized by f = 2.5 ± 0.9 %, for M⋆∼ 0.4 M⊙ and
f = 11.0 ± 2.0 %, for M⋆∼ 1.6 M⊙ . In a similar study, Bowler
et al. (2010) showed that the fraction of giant planets hosted by
stars with mass between 1.5 - 1.9 M⊙ is f = 26+9
−8 %, signiﬁ-
cantly higher than the value obtained by JOHN10.

In this paper we present the discovery of four giant planets
around giant stars that are part of the EXPRESS (EXoPlanets
aRound Evolved StarS) radial velocity program (Jones et al.
2011; hereafter JON11). The minimum masses of the substel-
lar companions range between 2.4 and 5.5 MJ , and have orbital
periods in the range 562-1560 days. All of them have low eccen-
tricity values e < 0.16. In addition to these planet discoveries, we
present a detailed analysis of the mass-metallicity correlations
of the planet-hosting and non-planet-hosting stars in our sample,
along with studying the fraction of multiple-planet systems ob-
served in giant stars.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 brieﬂy de-
scribes the observations and radial velocity computation tech-
niques. In Section 3 we summarize the main properties of the
host stars. In Section 4, we present a detailed analysis of the or-

bital ﬁts and stellar activity analysis. In Section 5 we present a
statistical analysis of the mass-metallicity correlation of our host
stars. Also, we discuss about the occurrence rate of multiple-
planet systems. The summary and discussion are presented in
Section 6.

2. Observations and RV calculation

Since 2009 we have been monitoring a sample of 166 bright gi-
ant stars that are observable from the southern hemisphere. The
selection criteria of the sample are presented in JON11. We
have been using two telescopes located in the Atacama desert
in Chile, namely the 1.5 m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-
American Observatory and the 2.2 m telescope at La Silla ob-
servatory. The former was initially equipped with the ﬁber-fed
echelle spectrograph (FECH), which was replaced in 2011 by
CHIRON (Tokovinin et al. 2013), a much higher resolution3 and
more stable spectrograph. These two spectrographs are equipped
with an I2 cell, which is used as a precision wavelength refer-
ence.

The 2.2 m telescope is connected to the Fiber-fed Extended
Range Optical Spectrograph (FEROS; Kaufer et al. 1999) via
optical ﬁbres to stabilise the pupil entering the spectrograph.
FEROS oﬀers a unique observing mode, delivering a spectral
resolution of ∼ 48,000, and does not require the beam be passed
through an I2 cell for precise wavelength calibration, using a
Thorium-Argon gas lamp instead.

We have taken several spectra for each of the stars in our
sample using these instruments. In the case of FECH and CH-
IRON, we have computed precision radial velocities using the
iodine cell method (Butler et al. 1996). We achieve typi-
cally a precision of ∼ 10-15 m s−1 from FECH data, and ∼ 5
m s−1 for CHIRON. On the other hand, for FEROS spectra, we
used the simultaneous calibration method (Baranne et al. 1996)
to extract the stellar radial velocities, reaching a typical preci-
sion of ∼ 5 m s−1 . Details on the data reduction and RV cal-
culations have been given in several papers (e.g. Jones et al.
2013; 2014; 2015a; 2015b).
In addition, we present comple-
mentary observations from the Pan-Paciﬁc Planet Search (PPPS;
Wittenmyer et al. 2011). These spectroscopic data have been
taken with the UCLES spectrograph (Diego et al. 1990), which
delivers a resolution of R ∼ 45,000, using a 1 arcsec slit. The
instrument is mounted on the 3.9 m Anglo-Australian telescope
and is also equipped with an I2 cell for wavelength calibration.
Details on the reduction procedure and RV calculations can be
found in Tinney et al. (2001) and Wittenmyer et al. (2012).

3. Host stars properties

Table 1 lists the stellar properties of HIP 8541 (= HD 11343
), HIP 74890 (= HD 135760), HIP 84056 (= HD 155233) and
HIP 95124 (= HD 181342). The spectral type, B − V color, vi-
sual magnitude, and parallax of these stars were taken from the
Hipparcos catalog (Van Leeuwen 2007). The atmospheric pa-
rameters (Te f f , logg, [Fe/H], vsini) were computed using the
MOOG code4 (Sneden 1973), following the methodology de-
scribed in JON11. The stellar mass and radius was derived by
comparing the position of the star in the HR diagram with the
evolutionary tracks from Salasnich et al. (2000). A detailed de-
scription of the method is presented in Jones et al. (2011; 2015b)

4. Orbital parameters and activity analysis

4.1. HIP8541b

We have computed a total of 36 precision RVs of HIP8541, from
FEROS, CHIRON, and UCLES spectra taken between 2009 and
2015. These velocities are listed in Table A.1, and are shown
in Figure 1. As can be seen, there is a large RV signal with
an amplitude that exceeds the instrumental uncertainties, and
the RV jitter expected for the spectral type of this star (e.g.
Sato et al. 2005), by an order of magnitude. A Lomb-Scargle
(LS) periodogram (Scargle 1982) revealed a strong peak around
∼ 1600 days. Starting from this orbital period, we computed
the Keplerian solution using the Systemic Console version 2.17
(Meschiari et al. 2009). To do this, we added a 5 m s−1 error in
quadrature to the internal instrumental uncertainties. This value
is the typical level of RV noise induced by stellar pulsations in
these type of giant stars (Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995). We ob-
tained a single-planet solution with the following parameters: P
= 1560.2 ± 53.9 d, mb sini= 5.5 ± 1.0 MJ and e = 0.16 ± 0.06.
The post-ﬁt RMS is 9.1 m s−1 , and no signiﬁcant periodicity or
linear trend is observed in the RV residuals. The RV uncertain-
ties were computed using the Systemic bootstrap tool.
In the
case of the planet mass and semi-major axis, the uncertainty was
computed by error propagation, including both the uncertainties
in the ﬁt (from the bootstrap tool) and also the uncertainty in the
stellar mass. The full set of orbital parameters and their corre-
sponding uncertainties are listed in Table 2.

Since stellar intrinsic phenomena can mimic the presence of
a sub-stellar companion (e.g. Huelamo et al. 2008; Figueira et
al. 2010; Boisse et al. 2011), we examined the All Sky Auto-
matic Survey (ASAS; Pojmanski 1997) V-band photometry and
the Hipparcos photometric data of HIP 8541. For both datasets,
we included only the best quality data (grade A and quality ﬂag
equal to 0 and 1, respectively). We also ﬁltered the ASAS data
using a 3-σ rejection method to remove outliers, which are typ-
ically due to CCD saturation. The photometric stability of the
ASAS and Hipparcos data are 0.013 and 0.012 mag, respec-
tively. Moreover, a periodogram analysis of these two datasets
show no signiﬁcant peak around the period obtained from the
RV time-series. Similarly, we computed the bisector velocity
span (BVS; Toner & Gray 1988; Queloz et al. 2001) and the
full width at half maximum (FWHM) variations of the cross-
correlation function (CCF), from FEROS spectra. None of these
activity indicators show any signiﬁcant correlation with the ob-
served RVs. Finally, we computed the S-index variations from
the reversal core emission of the Ca ii H and K lines, according

to the method presented in Jenkins et al. (2008; 2011), revealing
no signiﬁcant correlation with the measured velocities.

4.2. HIP74890b

The velocity variations of HIP 74890 are listed in Table A.2. The
RVs were computed from FEROS and UCLES spectra, taken be-
tween the beginning of 2009 and mid 2015. A detailed analysis
of the RV data revealed a periodic signal, which is superimposed
onto a linear trend. The best Keplerian ﬁt is best explained by a
giant planet with a projected mass of 2.4 ± 0.3 MJ , in a 822-day
orbit with a low eccentricity of e = 0.07 ± 0.07. A third ob-
ject in the system induces a linear acceleration of -33.23 ± 1.46
m s−1yr−1. The full set of parameters with their uncertainties are
listed in Table 2. Using the Winn et al.
(2009) relationship,
we obtained a mass and orbital distance of the outer object of
mcsini > 7.9 MJ and ac > 6.5 AU, respectively. Figure 2 shows
the HIP 74890 radial velocities.

The Hipparcos and ASAS photometric datasets of this stars
present a stability of 0.008 mag and 0.013 mag, respectively. No

signiﬁcant peak is observed in the LS periodogram of these two
datasets. Similarly, the BVS analysis, CCF variations, and chro-
mospheric activity analysis show neither an indication of peri-
odic variability, nor any correlation with the radial velocities.

4.3. HIP84056b

The velocity variations of HIP 84056 are listed in Table A.3 and
Figure 3 shows its RV curve. The best orbital solution leads to:
P = 818.8 ± 12.1 d, mb sini = 2.6 ± 0.3 and e = 0.04 ± 0.04.
The full orbital elements solution are listed in Table 2. This
planet was independently detected by the PPPS (Wittenmyer et
al. 2016). Based on 21 RV epochs, they obtained an orbital
period of 885 ± 63 days, minimum mass of 2.0 ± 0.5 MJ , and
eccentricity of 0.03 ± 0.2, in good agreement with our results.

To determine the nature of the periodic RV signal observed
in HIP84056, we performed an activity analysis, as described in
section 4.1. We found no signiﬁcant periodicity or variability
of the activity indicators with the observed RVs. Moreover, the
photometric analysis of the Hipparcos data reveals a stability of
0.009 mag. Similarly, the RMS of the ASAS data is 0.012 mag.
These results support the planet hypothesis of the periodic signal
detected in the RVs.

4.4. HIP95124b

Figure 4 shows the RV variations of HIP95124. The orbital pa-
rameters are listed in Table 2. The RV variations of HIP 8541
are best explained by the presence of a 2.9 ± 0.2 MJ planet, with
orbital period of P = 562.1 ± 6.0 d and eccentricity e = 0.1 ±
0.07. The radial velocities are also listed in Table A.4. As for
the other stars described here, we scrutinized the Hipparcos and
ASAS photometry to search for any signal with a period similar
to that observed in the RV timeseries, ﬁnding a null result. More-
over, the Hipparcos and ASAS RMS is 0.007 mag and 0.013
mag. According to Hatzes (2002), this photometric variability is
well below the level to mimic the RV amplitude observed in this

ations show no signiﬁcant correlation with the observed radial
velocities.

5. Preliminary statistical results of the EXPRESS

project

After 6 years of continuous monitoring of a sample comprised
by 166 giant stars, we have published a total of 11 substellar
companions (including this work), orbiting 10 diﬀerent stars. In
addition to this, using combined data of the EXPRESS and PPPS
surveys, we have detected a two-planet system in a 3:5 mean-
motion resonance (Wittenmyer et al. 2015) around the giant
star HIP 24275. Moreover, Trifonov et al. (2014), recently an-

nounced the discovery of a two-planet systems around HIP 5364,
as part of the Lick Survey (Frink et al. 2002). Since this star is
part of our RV program, we have also taken several FECH and
CHIRON spectra. The resulting velocities will be presented in a
forthcoming paper (Jones et al., in preparation).

In summary, a total of 15 substellar companions to 12 diﬀer-
ent stars in our sample have been conﬁrmed, plus a number of
candidate systems that are currently being followed-up (Jones et
al. in preparation). These objects have projected masses in the
range 1.4 - 20.0 MJ , and orbital periods between 89 d (0.46 AU)
and 2132 d (3.82 AU).

Figure 5 shows the orbital distance versus stellar mass for
these 12 systems. The red and blue dashed lines represent radial
velocity amplitudes of K = 30 m s−1 (assuming circular orbits),
which correspond to ∼ 3-σ detection limits5. It can be seen that
we can detect planets with MP & 3.0 MJ up to a ∼ 3 AU (or MP
& 2.5 MJ at a ∼ 2.5 AU) around stars with M⋆. 2.5 M⊙ . For
more massive stars, we can only detect such planets but at closer
orbital distance (a . 2.5 AU for M⋆= 3.0 M⊙ ). We note that we
have collected at least 15 RV epochs for each of our targets, with
a typical timespan of ∼ 2-3 years, which allow us to eﬃciently
detect periodic RV signals with K & 30 m s−1 and e . 0.6 via
periodogram analysis and visual inspection. Moreover, we have
obtained additional data for our targets showing RV variability &
20 m s−1 , including those presenting linear trends. In fact, some
of these linear trend systems are brown-dwarf candidates, with
orbital periods exceeding the total observational timespan of our
survey (P & 2200 d; see Bluhm et al., submitted). We also note
that in the case of HIP 67851 c (Jones et al. 2015b), we used
ESO archive data to fully cover its orbital period (P = 2132 d; a
= 3.82 AU).

Figure 6 shows a histogram of the planetary occurrence rate as
a function of the stellar mass in our sample. The bin width is
0.4 M⊙ and the stellar masses range from 0.9 M⊙ to 3.5 M⊙ . The
uncertainties were computed according to Cameron (2011), and

5 For FEROS and CHIRON data, the RV noise is dominated by stellar
pulsations, that induce velocity variability of ∼ 5-10 m s−1 level in our
targets. In fact, according to Kjeldsen & Bedding (1995), only 4 of our
targets are expected to present velocity variations larger than 10 m s−1 .
In the case of FECH data, the instrumental uncertainty is comparable to
the stellar pulsations noise.

seen, there is an increase in the detection fraction with the stellar
mass, between ∼ 1.0 -2.1 M⊙ , reaching a peak in the occurrence
rate of f = 13.0+10.1
−4.2 %, at M⋆= 2.1 M⊙ . In addition, there is a
sharp drop in the occurrence rate at stellar masses & 2.5 M⊙ . In
fact, there are 17 stars in our survey in this mass regime, but none
of them host a planet. We note that, although the observed lack
of planets around these stars might be in part explained by the re-
duced RV sensitivity (see Figure 5), all of our targets more mas-
sive than 2.5 M⊙ present RV variability . 15 m s−1 . This means
that we can also discard the presence of planets with MP & 3.0

doppler-induced variability at the & 20 m s−1 level.6 Following
the REF15 results, we ﬁtted a Gaussian function to the data, of

K is the semi-amplitude of the signal. Thus, for a K = 30 m s−1 semi-
amplitude RV signal, we expect to observe a variability (RMS) of ∼ 21
m s−1 , while for K = 21 m s−1 is ∼ 15 m s−1 .

To obtain the values of C, µ and σ, we generated 10000 syn-
thetic datasets, computing the conﬁdence limits for each realiza-
tion following the Cameron (2011) prescription. After ﬁtting C,
µ and σ for each synthetic dataset, we end-up with a probabil-
ity density distribution for each of these three parameters. We
note that we ﬁrst computed C, and then we ﬁxed it to compute
µ and σ, restricting these two parameters to: µ ∈ [1.5,3.0] and
σ ∈ [0.0,1.5]. Figure 7 shows our results for the three param-
eters. The red lines correspond to the smoothed distributions.

We obtained the following values: C = 0.14 +0.08

M⊙ , and σ = 0.64 +0.44
−0.03 M⊙ . The parameters were derived from
the maximum value and equal-tailed conﬁdence limits of each
smoothed distribution, respectively.

Despite the fact that we are dealing with low number statis-
tics, particularly for the upper mass bin, these results are in ex-
cellent agreement with previous works. JOHN10, based on a
sample of 1266 stars with M⋆∼ 0.5 -2.0 M⊙ , showed that the oc-
currence rate of planets increases linearly with the mass of the
host star, reaching a fraction of ∼ 14 % at M⋆∼ 2.0 M⊙ . Sim-
ilarly, based on a sample of 373 giant stars with M⋆∼ 1.0 - 5.0
M⊙ , REF15 showed that the detection fraction of giant plan-
ets present a Gaussian distribution, with a peak in the detec-
tion fraction of ∼ 8 % at ∼ 1.9 M⊙ . Additionally, they showed
that the occurrence rate around stars more massive than ∼ 2.7
M⊙ is consistent with zero, in good agreement with our ﬁndings,
and also with theoretical predictions. For instance, based on a
semi-analytic calculation of an evolving snow-line, Kennedy &
Kenyon (2008) showed that the formation eﬃciency increases
linearly from 0.4 to 3.0 M⊙ . For stars more massive than 3.0
M⊙ , the formation of gas giant planets in the inner region of
the protoplanetary disk is strongly reduced. Because of the fast
stellar evolution timescale for those massive stars, the snow line
moves rapidly to 10-15 AU, preventing the formation of the gi-
ant planets in this region.

Figure 8 shows the planet occurrence rate as a function of
the stellar metallicity. The symbols and lines are the same as in

Article number, page 6 of 11

Figure 6. The width of the bins is 0.15 dex. It can be seen, that
the occurrence rate increases with the stellar metallicity, with a
peak of f = 16.7+15.5
−5.9 % around stars with [Fe/H] = 0.35 dex.
This trend seems to be real, despite a relatively high fraction ob-
served in the bin centered at -0.25 dex, which might be explained
by the low number statistics for that speciﬁc bin. Following the
prescription of FIS05, we ﬁtted the metallicity dependence of
the occurrence fraction, with a function of the form:

f ([Fe/H]) = α 10β [Fe/H] .

(2)

Using a similar approach for ﬁtting equation 1, we obtained the
−0.42 dex−1. Fig-
following values: α = 0.061+0.028

tained after ﬁtting the synthetic datasets. The functional depen-
dence of the occurrence rate with [Fe/H] (equation 2) is over-
plotted (solid curve).

−0.003, and β = 1.27+0.83

This relationship between the occurrence rate and the stellar
metallicity is also observed in solar-type stars (Gonzalez 1997;
Santos et al. 2001). Moreover, according to REF15, this trend
is also present in giant stars.
Interestingly, they also showed
that there is an overabundance of planets around giant stars with
[Fe/H] ∼ -0.3, similarly to what we found in our sample.

To investigate whether one of the two correlations presented
above are spurious, we investigated the level of correlation be-
tween the stellar mass and metallicity in our sample. Figure 10
shows the mass of the star as a function of the metallicity for
all of our targets (ﬁlled dots). The open circles are the planet-
hosting stars. In the top left corner is shown the mean uncertainty
in [Fe/H] and M⋆. From Figure 10, it is clear that there is some
dependence between these two quantities. The Pearson linear
coeﬃcient is r = 0.27, which means that there is an insigniﬁcant
level of correlation. Moreover, if we restrict our analysis to stars
with M⋆< 2.5 M⊙ , the r-value drops to 0.22, and we obtain a
steeper rise of the occurrence rate with the stellar metallicity.
Thus, we conclude that the two correlations presented in Figures
6 and 8 are valid.

In addition, we computed the fraction of our stars hosting
planets in the stellar mass-metallicity space, using the same bins
size presented in REF15. These results are listed in Table 3.
Columns 1 and 2 correspond to the stellar metallicity and mass
bins, each of 0.16 dex and 0.8 M⊙ , respectively. The number of

stars with detected planets (np), number of stars in the bin (ns)
and the fraction of stars with planets in each bin ( f ), are listed in
columns 3-5. It can be seen that the highest fraction is obtained
in the bin centered at 1.4 M⊙ and 0.12 dex ( f = 9.4+8.3
−5.1), which
is slightly higher than the value of the bin with the same metal-
licity, but centered at 2.2 M⊙ ( f = 9.1+10.8
−5.8 ). Interestingly, REF15
found a similar trend, i.e., they also obtained the highest fraction
in these two mass-metallicity bins, although they claim higher
values for f . Also, we analyzed the combined results of the two
surveys. These are listed in columns 6-8 in Table 3. It can be
seen that the overall trend is unaﬀected, but the uncertainties in
the planet fraction are smaller.

Finally, to understand whether the combined results are af-
fected by systematic diﬀerences in the stellar parameters derived
independently by the two surveys, we compared the resulting
metallicities of the Lick Survey (listed in REF15) with those de-
rived using our method. We used a total of 16 stars, from which
12 of them are common targets. We measured a diﬀerence of
∆([Fe/H]) = 0.03 dex ± 0.11 dex, showing the good agreement
between the two methods7. Similarly, we compared the masses
of the stars derived by the two surveys. We found that our stel-
lar masses are on average larger by ∆(M⋆) = 0.15 ± 0.37 M⊙ ,
which corresponds to a ratio of 1.07 ± 0.18. For comparison,
Niedzielski et al. (2016) also found that our stellar masses are
overestimated with respect to their values by a factor 1.15 ± 0.10.
We also note that the planet-hosting star HIP 5364 is a common
target of the two surveys. They obtained Teﬀ = 4528 ± 19 K and
[Fe/H] = 0.07 ± 0.1 dex. Using these values they derived a mass
of 1.7 ± 0.1 M⊙ for this star (Trifonov et al. 2014), signiﬁcantly
lower than our value of 2.4 ± 0.3 M⊙ . This shows that the com-
bined results of the Lick and EXPRESS surveys should be taken
with caution. Certainly, a more detailed comparison between the
stellar parameters derived independently by the two surveys, as
well as their completeness, will allow us to check the validity of
these combined results.

7 Our typical dispersion (RMS) in the metallicity derived by each of
the ∼ 150 Fe i individual lines is ∼ 0.1 dex, corresponding to an internal
error . 0.01 dex.

5.2. Multiple-planetsystems.

Out of the 12 planet-hosting stars in our sample, HIP 5364,
HIP 24275 and HIP 67851 host planetary systems with at least
two giant planets. This means that 25% of the parent stars, host
a multiple system. Considering the full sample, it yields a ∼ 2 %
fraction of multiple systems, comprised by two or more giant
planets (Mp > 1.0 MJ ). This number is a lower limit, since there
are several other systems in our sample whose velocities are
compatible with the presence of a distant giant planet, but still
need conﬁrmation (e.g. HIP 74890, presented in section 4.2).

If we consider all of the known planet-hosting giant stars
(logg . 3.6), around 10% of them host a planetary system com-
prised by at least two giant planets. This fraction is signiﬁcantly
higher compared to solar-type stars. In fact, there are only 21
such systems among dwarf stars8, despite the fact that most of

the RV surveys have targeted those type of stars. Moreover, plan-
ets are easier to be detected via precision RVs around solar-type
stars, because they are on average less massive and have p-modes
oscillations much weaker than giant stars (Kjeldsen & Bedding
1995), which translates into larger amplitudes with a lower level
of RV noise. This observational result is a natural extension of
the known mass distribution of single-planet systems orbiting
evolved stars, which is characterized by an overabundance of
super-Jupiter-like planets (e.g. Lovis & Mayor 2007; Döllinger
et al. 2009; Jones et al. 2014). This result also reinforces the
observed positive correlation between the stellar and planetary
mass, in the sense that more massive stars not only tend to form
more massive single planets, but also more massive multi-planet
systems.

6. Summary and discussion

In this work we present precision radial velocities of four giant
stars that have been targeted by the EXPRESS project, during the
past six years. These velocities show periodic signals, with semi-
amplitudes between ∼ 50 - 100 m s−1 , which are likely caused by
the doppler shift induced by orbiting companions. We performed
standard tests (chromospheric emission, line bisector analysis
and photometric variability) aimed at studying whether these RV
signals have an intrinsic stellar origin. We found no correlation
between the stellar intrinsic indicator with the observed veloci-
ties. Therefore, we conclude that the most probable explanation
of the periodic RV signals observed in these stars is the presence
of substellar companions. The best Keplerian ﬁt to the RV data
of the four stars leads to minimum masses between mb sini= 2.4 -
5.5 MJ and orbital periods P = 562 - 1560 days. Interestingly, all
of them have low eccentricities (e ≤ 0.16), conﬁrming that most
of the giant planets orbiting evolved stars present orbital eccen-
tricities . 0.2 (Schlaufman & Winn 2013; Jones et al. 2014).
The RVs of HIP 74890 also reveal the presence of a third object
at large orbital separation (a > 6.5 AU). The RV trend induced
by this object is most likely explained by a brown dwarf or a
stellar companion.

We also present a statistical analysis of the mass-metallicity
correlations of the planet-hosting stars in our sample. This sub-
sample is comprised of 12 stars, drawn from a parent sample of
166 stars, which host a total of 15 giant planets. We show that

Article number, page 8 of 11

the fraction of giant planets f , increases with the stellar mass in
the range between ∼ 1.0 - 2.1 M⊙ , despite the fact that planets
are more easily detected around less massive stars. For compar-
ison, we obtained f = 2.6+5.4
−0.8 % for M⋆∼ 1.3 M⊙ , and a peak of
f = 13.0+10.1
−4.2 % for stars with M⋆∼ 2.1 M⊙ . These results are
in good agreement with previous works showing that the occur-
rence rate of giant planets exhibit a positive correlation with the
stellar mass, up to M⋆∼ 2.0 M⊙ (e.g. JOHN10; REF15). For
stars more massive than ∼ 2.5 M⊙ , the fraction of planets is con-
sistent with zero. We ﬁtted the overall occurrence distribution
with a Gaussian function (see Eq. 1), obtaining the following
parameters: C = 0.14 +0.08
−0.06 M⊙ , and σ = 0.64 +0.44
−0.03
M⊙ .

−0.01, µ = 2.29 +0.44

Similarly, we studied the occurrence rate of giant planets as a
function of the stellar metallicity. We found an overabundance of
planets around metal-rich stars, with a peak of f = 16.7+15.5
−5.9 %
for stars with [Fe/H] ∼ 0.35 dex. We ﬁtted the metallicity de-
pendence of the occurrence rate with a function of the form
f = α10β [Fe/H], obtaining the following parameter values: α =
−0.42 dex−1. Our power-law index β
0.061+0.028
lies in between the values measured by JOHN10 (β = 1.2 ± 0.2)
and FIS05 (β = 2.0). Thus, our results suggest that the planet-
metallicity correlation observed in solar-type stars is also present
in intermediate-mass (M⋆& 1.5 M⊙ ) evolved stars, in agreement
with REF15 results.

−0.003, and β = 1.27+0.83

Finally, we investigated the fraction of multiple planetary
systems comprised by two or more giant planets. Out of the
12 systems presented above, three of them contain two giant
planets, which is a signiﬁcant fraction of the total number of
these planetary systems. If we also consider multi-planet sys-
tems published by other RV surveys, we found that there is a
signiﬁcantly higher fraction of them around intermediate-mass
evolved stars in comparison to solar-type stars. This result is not
surprising, since diﬀerent works have shown that giant planets
are more frequent around intermediate-mass stars (Döllinger et
al. 2009; Bowler et al. 2010), which is also supported by the-
oretical predictions (Kennedy & Kenyon 2008). Also, planets
tend to be more massive around intermediate-mass stars com-
pared to those around solar-type stars (e.g. Lovis & Mayor 2007;
Döllinger et al. 2009; Jones et al. 2014). Thus, we conclude that
the high fraction of multiple systems observed in giant stars is a
