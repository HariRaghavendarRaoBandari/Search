ABSTRACT

In the last years, ultra-low temperature chemical kinetic experiments have demonstrated that some
gas-phase reactions are much faster than previously thought. One example is the reaction between
OH and CH3OH, which has been recently found to be accelerated at low temperatures yielding CH3O
as main product. This ﬁnding opened the question of whether the CH3O observed in the dense
core Barnard 1b could be formed by the gas-phase reaction of CH3OH and OH. Several chemical
models including this reaction and grain-surface processes have been developed to explain the observed
abundance of CH3O with little success. Here we report for the ﬁrst time rate coeﬃcients for the
gas-phase reaction of OH and CH3OH down to a temperature of 22 K, very close to those in cold
interstellar clouds. Two independent experimental set-ups based on the supersonic gas expansion
technique coupled to the pulsed laser photolysis-laser induced ﬂuorescence technique were used to
determine rate coeﬃcients in the temperature range 22-64 K. The temperature dependence obtained
in this work can be expressed as k(22-64 K) = (3.6± 0.1)× 10−12(T /300 K)−(1.0±0.2) cm3 molecule−1
s−1. Implementing this expression in a chemical model of a cold dense cloud results in CH3O/CH3OH
abundance ratios similar or slightly lower than the value of ∼ 3 × 10−3 observed in Barnard 1b. This
ﬁnding conﬁrms that the gas-phase reaction between OH and CH3OH is an important contributor
to the formation of interstellar CH3O. The role of grain-surface processes in the formation of CH3O,
although it cannot be fully neglected, remains controversial.

INTRODUCTION

Cold interstellar clouds are known to contain a rich
variety of molecules whose synthesis has long been
thought to rely on gas-phase ion-neutral chemical reac-
tions (Herbst & Leung 1989). Since the 1990s, chem-
ical kinetic experiments have demonstrated that many
gas-phase neutral-neutral reactions in which at least one
of the reactants is a radical are very rapid at low tem-
peratures (Canosa et al. 2008; Smith & Barnes 2013)
and thus play an important role in interstellar chemistry
(Smith et al. 2004). Because cold interstellar clouds have
extremely low temperatures, usually around 10 K, only
gas-phase chemical reactions which are exothermic and
barrierless are considered in reaction networks currently
used to model the chemistry of cold interstellar clouds
(Ag´undez & Wakelam 2013).

Recently, the reaction of hydroxyl (OH) radicals and
methanol (CH3OH) has been experimentally found to
be very rapid at temperatures down to 56 K, despite
the presence of an energy barrier, which is probably
surpassed by quantum tunnelling (Shannon et al. 2013;
G´omez Mart´ın et al. 2014). This ﬁnding has important
potential implications for the chemistry of the interstel-
lar medium. Indeed, the empirical evidence of a chemical

elena.jimenez@uclm.es; andre.canosa@univ-rennes1.fr

reaction that overcomes an energy barrier at low temper-
atures opens the possibility to ﬁnd other reactions with
a similar behaviour (see, e.g., Sims 2013) that could be
potentially important for interstellar chemistry albeit to
date they are not included in chemical models. Hith-
erto, reaction kinetic databases used to model interstel-
lar chemistry, such as UMIST and KIDA (McElroy et al.
2013; Wakelam et al. 2015), are largely based on data
obtained at temperatures above 200 K (Atkinson et al.
2006).
In particular, the rate constant of the reaction
between OH and CH3OH, which can be represented by
the expression 2.85×10−12 exp (−345/T ) cm3 molecule−1
s−1 in the temperature range 210-300 K (Atkinson et al.
2006), was previously presumed to be negligible at inter-
stellar temperatures.

There are two possible pathways for the titled reaction:

CH3OH + OH → CH3O + H2O,
CH3OH + OH → CH2OH + H2O.

(1a)
(1b)

The branching ratios of channels (1a) and (1b) were re-
ported to depend on temperature between 70 and 900
K (Shannon et al. 2013). At temperatures above 250
K, the formation of hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) radicals
is favoured, while at much lower temperatures the for-

mation of CH3O via reaction (1a) was reported to be
the major reaction pathway (Shannon et al. 2013). At
82 K, it was found experimentally that the formation of
CH3O in the reaction of OH with methanol occurs at a
similar rate than the removal of OH radicals (Shannon
et al. 2013). Master equation calculations performed by
Shannon et al. (2013) corroborated the experimental ob-
servations and indicated that at 70 K, CH3O radicals
are expected to be formed with a > 99% yield. For that
reason, channel (1a) and its rate coeﬃcient, k1a, are re-
ferred henceforth to as reaction (1) and k1, respectively.
Cernicharo et al. (2012) recently detected CH3O toward
the cold dense cloud Barnard 1b (B1-b) where the gas
kinetic temperature is 10-15 K. Taking into account that
methanol is ∼ 300 times more abundant than CH3O in
B1-b ( ¨Oberg et al. 2010; Cernicharo et al. 2012), Cer-
nicharo et al. suggested that the gas-phase reaction be-
tween OH and CH3OH emerges as a potential eﬃcient
way to form CH3O in this source.

Soon after reaction (1) was empirically found to be
accelerated at low temperatures with respect to room
temperature (Shannon et al. 2013), the chemistry of cold
dark clouds has been revisited from a theoretical point
of view (Vasyunin & Herbst 2013; Reboussin et al. 2014;
Ruaud et al. 2015; Balucani et al. 2015; Acharyya et
al. 2015; Kalv˜ans 2015). These studies were mainly
dedicated to explore the formation of complex organic
molecules, such as CH3OCH3 and HCOOCH3, although
some of them discussed also the formation of CH3O
(Vasyunin & Herbst 2013; Ruaud et al. 2015; Balucani
et al. 2015; Acharyya et al. 2015). The rate coeﬃcient
k1 adopted by these authors was in consonance with the
values reported by Shannon et al. (2013). The value of
k1 measured by Shannon et al. (2013) at 63 K was ca.
4×10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 and calculations performed
by these authors indicate that by 20 K the rate coeﬃcient
has reached the collision limit (3×10−10 cm3 molecule−1
s−1). Extending the temperature range down to 56 K,
G´omez Mart´ın et al. (2014) measured a rate coeﬃcient
ca. 5 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 and, using their ki-
netic data in the range 56-88 K, reported an extrapolated
value of k1 at 0 K of ca. 6 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1,
which suggests a less pronounced increase of k1 with de-
creasing temperature than predicted by Shannon et al.
(2013). The value of k1 adopted by chemical models of

cold dark clouds that have addressed the formation of
CH3O has been either 4 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 or
3 × 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.

In this paper, we present the ﬁrst determination of
rate coeﬃcients for the reaction of OH with CH3OH at
temperatures down to 22 K, which allows having a ﬁrst
complete picture of the temperature dependence of k1 at
temperatures below 50 K and much closer to the typical
temperatures, ∼ 10 K, found in dark molecular clouds.
In the light of the new rate coeﬃcients reported here, we
also re-evaluate whether the gas-phase route involving
reaction (1a) is by itself able to explain the CH3O abun-
dance observed in B1-b. For that purpose, we model the
chemistry of cold dense clouds adopting the extrapolated
value of k1 at 10 K from the temperature dependence ob-
served in this work.

2. METHODS

2.1. Measurement of the rate coeﬃcients for
reaction (1) at ultra-low temperatures

2.1.1. Ultra-cold environment:

Uniform supersonic gas expansion technique

The CRESU (Cin´etique de R´eaction en Ecoulement
Supersonique Uniforme, which means Reaction Kinet-
ics in a Uniform Supersonic Flow) technique has been
used in this work to cover the temperature range 22-64
K. Two independent apparatus were employed. These
are the CRESU apparatus recently constructed in the
University of Castilla-La Mancha (hereafter referred as
UCLM system) and the CRESU system available in the
University of Rennes 1 (hereafter referred as UR1 sys-
tem). The UCLM CRESU was used to investigate the
kinetics of OH and methanol at four temperatures (22 K,
42 K, 52 K and 64 K), whereas the UR1 CRESU system
operated at three temperatures (48 K, 52 K and 61 K).
As both systems have been previously described else-
where (Jim´enez et al. 2015a,b; Sims et al. 1994; Canosa et
al. 2008) only some remarks are mentioned here. In both
CRESU systems, a stainless steel chamber is connected
to a pumping system to generate low pressures inside
(Pcham). A supersonic ﬂow is achieved by isentropic ex-
pansion of a buﬀer gas through a speciﬁcally designed
Laval nozzle separating a movable stagnation reservoir
maintained at room temperature from the main vacuum
chamber. The quality and the physical conditions of
the ﬂow directly depend on the geometry of the Laval
nozzle on the one hand and on the nature and the ﬂow
rate of the buﬀer gas on the other hand. The gas ﬂows
through the reservoir at a constant ﬂow rate, providing
a constant background pressure Pcham, when using the
suitable pumping speed. The UCLM system can operate
with a gas ﬂow in either pulsed or continuous mode, while
the UR1 system is operating exclusively in the latter one.
In the UCLM pulsed mode (T = 22 K), the movable ex-
pansion system also included a rotary disk (aerodynamic
chopper) in order to pulse the gas inside the Laval noz-
zle, while in the continuous mode (T = 42, 52, 64 K) the
gas is constantly ﬂowing by one of the apertures of the
aerodynamic chopper maintained at rest.
In the UR1
system, there is no rotary disk in the movable expan-
sion system. In Table 1 a summary of the experimental
conditions is presented for both CRESU systems. In the
UCLM system, the same convergent-divergent Laval noz-

zle was operated under diﬀerent physical conditions to
achieve the desired temperatures and gas densities. For
temperatures higher than 22 K, the bath gas (helium)
was changed by (nitrogen) or a mixture of both gases,
as previously described in Jim´enez et al. (2015b). In the
UR1 system, nitrogen or argon was used as a bath gas to
obtain the three diﬀerent temperature conditions, each
of them achieved by using a diﬀerent Laval nozzle.

2.1.2. Kinetic technique and

determination of the rate coeﬃcients k1

For carrying out the kinetic experiment of reaction (1),
ﬁrstly the OH radicals have to be generated in situ. In
this work, the Pulsed Laser Photolysis (PLP) of gaseous
H2O2,

H2O2 + hν → 2 OH,

(2)

was the source of OH radicals in both CRESU systems.
The photolysis wavelengths were 248 nm (from a KrF
excimer laser in UCLM) and 266 nm (from the fourth
harmonic of a Nd-YAG laser in UR1). Gaseous H2O2
was introduced into the reservoir by passing a small ﬂow
of the bath gas through a concentrated solution of H2O2
contained in a glass bubbler. Aqueous solution of H2O2,
which was provided by Sharlab at a concentration of 50
% v/v, was further puriﬁed by bubbling helium or nitro-
gen through the liquid for a few days in order to remove
water at least partly. Concentrations of about 70 % were
obtained by this method for H2O2 in the solution. Liquid
samples of methanol (with a purity ≥ 99.8% in UCLM
and HPLC grade in UR1) were degassed prior to its use.
The introduction of methanol in the reservoir was made
diﬀerently in UCLM and in UR1. In the UCLM system,
mixtures of methanol vapour and the bath gas were pre-
pared and stored in two 20 L glass bulbs prior to the
experiments. Then, the content of the storage bulbs was
directed into the reservoir by means of a calibrated mass
ﬂow controller.
In the UR1 set-up, gaseous methanol
was introduced in the reservoir similarly to H2O2, i.e.,
by passing a bath gas identical to the main buﬀer gas
through a bubbler containing liquid CH3OH. The tem-
perature and pressure were measured in the bubbler dur-
ing experiments. The partial ﬂow of methanol was then
obtained knowing the bath gas ﬂow rate as well as the
vapour pressure of CH3OH at the bubbler temperature
(see El Dib et al. 2013 for details). In both CRESU sys-
tems, a third ﬂow of the buﬀer gas was introduced into
the reservoir by a separate entry port to reach the desired
reservoir pressure Pres. This ﬂow is the main contributor
to the total gas ﬂow through the reservoir.
In the presence of an excess of methanol, i.e., under
pseudo-ﬁrst order conditions where [CH3OH] (cid:29) [OH]
and [H2O2] (cid:29) [OH], the reaction scheme is described by
reaction (1), the reaction of OH with H2O2 (reaction 3),
and other losses of OH, such as diﬀusion or reaction with
impurities, if any (reaction 4):

CH3OH + OH → products,

H2O2 + OH → H2O + HO2,
OH → other losses.

(1)
(3)
(4)

Under our experimental conditions, reaction (4) can be
neglected since in the absence of methanol the loss of OH

cm−3, see text), have not been considered in the ﬁt of Equation (5).

radicals is governed by reaction with H2O2, which is in
large excess.

To obtain the kinetic information, the OH radicals
formed in reaction (2) are excited at 282 nm (radiation
from a frequency-doubled dye laser pumped either by a
XeCl excimer laser in UCLM or a 532 nm Nd-YAG laser
in UR1). The laser induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) from ex-
cited OH radicals was detected at ca. 310 nm by a pho-
tomultiplier tube as a function of reaction time. The
timescale of the reaction, which depends on the rate co-
eﬃcient k1 and the concentration of methanol introduced
into the reservoir, must be short enough to be smaller or
of the same order of magnitude than the hydrodynamic
time during which the supersonic ﬂow is kept uniform
(usually several hundreds of µs, the exact value being
speciﬁc to each ﬂow condition validated for a given Laval
nozzle). At short reaction times (tens of µs), the LIF
signal from excited OH increases due to rotational re-
laxation, so in the analysis of the OH temporal proﬁles,
only the decay of the LIF signal at t > 20 µs is consid-
ered. The analysis of the exponential decays yields the
pseudo-ﬁrst order rate coeﬃcients, k(cid:48), which is linearly
related to [CH3OH] under pseudo-ﬁrst order conditions:

k(cid:48) = k0 + k1(T )[CH3OH],

(5)

where k1(T ) is the bimolecular rate coeﬃcient for re-
action (1) at a given temperature and k0 is the mea-
sured rate coeﬃcient in the absence of methanol at the
same temperature, when only reactions (3) and (4) take
place. k0 ranged between 2800 and 8400 s1. This meant
a contribution of k0 to k(cid:48) very variable, between 40 and
95 %, although it typically did not exceed 70 %. Vary-
ing the concentration of methanol and maintaining the
concentration of the precursor of OH radicals constant,
k1(T ) can be obtained from the slope of the plot of k(cid:48)
(or k(cid:48) − k0) versus [CH3OH]. In the present study, we
have chosen the second option, because it is the only way
to compare results obtained at the same temperature in
independent experiments, in which k0 may diﬀer up to

12x1031086420k'-k0 / s-1543210[CH3OH] / 1014 cm-3  22.4 ± 1.4 K 64.2 ± 1.7 K 4
2000 s−1. Methanol concentrations were varied in UR1
by changing the pressure inside the CH3OH bubbling col-
umn using a micrometric valve. In UCLM, [CH3OH] was
varied by changing the mass ﬂow rate of the diluted mix-
ture from the storage bulb. Examples of plots of k(cid:48) − k0
versus [CH3OH] are presented in Fig. 1. In the UCLM
system, up to 48 kinetic experiments were carried out at
a single temperature, using diﬀerent mixing ratios of the
CH3OH/bath gas mixtures in the storage bulb. In the
UR1 apparatus, between 14 and 21 kinetic experiments
were performed for each Laval nozzle.

2.2. Chemical model

In order to evaluate the role of reaction (1) in the for-
mation of CH3O in B1-b, we have built a chemical model
adopting typical conditions of a cold dense cloud, i.e.,
a temperature of 10 K, a visual extinction of 30 mag,
a cosmic-ray ionization rate of H2 of 1.3 × 10−17 s−1,
and the so-called ”low-metal” elemental abundances (see
Ag´undez & Wakelam 2013). According to Daniel et al.
(2013), the volume density of H2 in B1-b has a steep ra-
dial gradient and takes values from a few 106 cm−3 at
the core center to ∼ 104 cm−3 in the outer regions of
the cloud (at some tens of arcsec from the center). Since
methanol has a widespread distribution in B1-b ( ¨Oberg
et al. 2010), and methoxy has probably a similar distribu-
tion, we adopted densities of H nuclei of 2×104 cm−3 and
1× 105 cm−3 to investigate the eﬀect of density. Since in
cold dense clouds, grain-surface chemistry is hampered
by the low mobility of most species on ice surfaces at the
low temperatures of dust, and since we aim at evaluating
the eﬃciency of gas-phase routes to CH3O, we did not
consider chemical reactions on grain surfaces other than
the formation of H2 by recombination of two H atoms.
We adopted the gas-phase reaction network of Ruaud et
al. (2015) with the rate coeﬃcient for reaction (1) up-
dated according to this work. Since it is well known
that pure gas-phase chemical models severely underesti-
mate the gas-phase abundance of CH3OH in cold dense
clouds (e.g., Ag´undez & Wakelam 2013), to be more re-
alistic, we assumed an abundance of methanol relative to
CO of 6 × 10−5, which is the value in B1-b according to
the abundances of CO and CH3OH derived by Lis et al.
(2002) and ¨Oberg et al. (2010), respectively.

The kinetic information on the gas-phase reactivity
of CH3O is quite scarce and limited to temperatures
above 200 K. Theoretical and experimental studies in-
dicate that reactions of CH3O with molecules such as
H2, CO, CH4, NH3, or CH3OH have important activa-
tion barriers (Sanders et al. 1980; Jodkowski et al. 1999;
Wang et al. 1999). The depletion of CH3O in cold dense
clouds is likely to be dominated by reactions with H and
O atoms,

whose rate coeﬃcients are however not known at inter-
stellar temperatures. We have adopted the same values

CH3O + H → H2CO + H2,
→ CH3 + OH,

CH3O + O → H2CO + OH,

→ CH3 + O2,

used by Ruaud et al. (2015)1 for k6a,b and k7a,b, which are
based on measurements at 300 K (Hoyermann et al. 1981;
D´ob´e et al. 1991; Ewig et al. 1987; Baulch et al. 2005).
Therefore, in the absence of grain-surface processes, the
chemistry of CH3O becomes rather simple in the model
as it is assumed to be formed through reaction (1) and
destroyed by reactions (6) and (7). Therefore, at steady
state the CH3O/CH3OH abundance ratio is given by:

[CH3O]
[CH3OH]

=

k1[OH]

k6[H] + k7[O]

,

(8)

where k1 is well constrained by our experiments and
thus the major source of uncertainty in the calculated
CH3O/CH3OH abundance ratio comes from the values
of k6 and k7 at low temperatures.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Evaluation of the role of secondary chemistry of

methanol in the determination of k1(T )

The knowledge of the methanol concentration is one
of the key parameters to derive a reliable rate coeﬃcient
from Equation (5). For that reason, an evaluation of the
potential eﬀect of any side reaction that could deplete
methanol is desirable.

No photolysis of methanol is expected at the photolysis
(248 nm or 266 nm) and excitation (282 nm) wavelengths
at the concentration levels and the low laser ﬂuences (less
than 1 mJ cm−2 per laser pulse measured at the exit of
the nozzle in UCLM and 75 mJ per laser pulse in UR1
measured at the exit of the laser) used in this work, if we
consider an upper limit for the absorption cross section
of 10−22 cm2 molecule−1 (Cheng et al. 2002).
As can be seen in Fig. 1, a slight curvature in the plots
of k(cid:48) − k0 versus [CH3OH] was observed at methanol
concentrations higher than 1 × 1014 molecule cm−3 for
the lowest temperature, 22 K. This curvature was also
observed by G´omez Mart´ın et al. (2014) at 56 K for
reaction (1) for methanol concentrations higher than
2.5 × 1014 molecule cm−3. This may be explained by a
clustering process that reduces the amount of methanol
available for reacting with OH radicals, leading to a de-
crease of the measured pseudo-ﬁrst order rate coeﬃcient
k(cid:48). The lower the temperature is, the more favourable the
cluster formation is, shifting the curvature in the pseudo-
ﬁrst order plots to much lower methanol concentrations.
Laksmono et al. (2011) observed the formation of clusters
of methanol, and even the formation of small droplets
in the divergent section of a Laval nozzle at 210 K, al-
though the methanol concentration in their experiments
was around 4 orders of magnitude higher than in ours.
Therefore, we believe that under our experimental con-
ditions the clusters that are formed are mainly methanol
dimers. In order to estimate the eﬀect of dimerization in
the measurement of the pseudo-ﬁrst order coeﬃcients, a
simple model has been developed using FACSIMILE soft-
ware for the worst scenario, i.e., the lowest temperature
where the gas density is the highest (see Table 2). The
reaction scheme of this model includes reactions (1) and
(3) together with the formation of a hydrogen-bonded

s−1 instead of 1.9 × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.

In the simulation, k1(T ) and the pseudo-ﬁrst order k(cid:48)
in the absence of methanol were ﬁxed to the value ob-
tained from the linear ﬁt according to Equation (5) and

It was also considered that the
dimer does not react with OH radicals. We estimate that
the observed curvature is compatible with a rate coeﬃ-
cient for the dimerization of methanol at 22 K of the
order of 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. The eﬀect of dimer-
ization on k(cid:48) can be neglected at concentrations lower
than 1× 1014 molecule cm−3, the ones considered in this
study. For intermediate temperatures, the concentration
range was also constrained to [CH3OH] below 2 × 1014
molecule cm−3, while at 64 K the maximum methanol
concentration was kept below 3.5 × 1014 molecule cm−3.
Consequently, only the linear part of these plots were
considered in obtaining k1(T ).

3.2. Potential role of water in the determination of

k1(T )

Water, which was introduced in conjunction with H2O2
in the reactor, did not play any signiﬁcant role in the
chemistry of the ﬂow.
Its potential aggregation to
methanol to form a H2O··· CH3OH complex was found
to be a negligible process in the loss of methanol.
In-
deed, water concentration in the cold ﬂow was estimated
to be similar to that of H2O2 taking into account the
concentration ratios in the liquid mixture and the vapor
pressures of H2O and H2O2, 42.4 mbar and 24.4 mbar at
300 K, respectively. The H2O2 concentration was eval-
uated using a room temperature UV absorption column
set in between the H2O2 bubbler and the reservoir at the
pressure condition of our experiment at 64 K. The ob-
tained concentration converted into the supersonic ﬂow
conditions was found to be about 6 × 1012 cm−3, rep-
resenting a few percent of the typical [CH3OH] used in
this experiment (see Fig. 1). The work of V¨ohringer-
Mart´ınez et al. (2007) on the catalytic eﬀect of water on
the OH+acetaldehyde gas-phase reaction between 58 K
and 300 K indicates that at temperatures below 100 K
the complexation of acetaldehyde molecules with water
is highly eﬃcient, although at high water concentrations
(3 % of the total density, i.e., 2.55 × 1015 cm−3 at 77
K). In the work of V¨ohringer-Mart´ınez et al. (2007), the
[H2O]/[CH3CHO] ratio is around 16. In our work at 64
K, [H2O] in the supersonic jet is estimated to be on the

and 64 K. The black line corresponds to Equation (10).

order of 1013 cm−3, and therefore [H2O]/[CH3OH] ratio
is < 0.1. Water content accounts for 0.04 % of the to-
tal gas density (2.24 × 1016 cm−3), i.e., it is negligible.
Moreover, V¨ohringer-Mart´ınez et al. (2007) concluded
that at water contents lower than 3 % no catalytic eﬀect
was observed for the OH+acetaldehyde system. Under
our experimental conditions, if H2O··· CH3OH cluster is
formed with an aggregation factor of unity (as suggested
by V¨ohringer-Mart´ınez et al. 2007 at T < 100 K) and
assuming that the kinetics of the dimer formation is fast
enough to produce it in the timescale of our experiment
(300 microseconds), the methanol concentration would
only be slightly reduced, thus not aﬀecting the measured
rate coeﬃcient.

3.3. Rate coeﬃcients k1(T ) between 22 K and 64 K
In light of the absence of any secondary chemistry un-
der our experimental conditions, k1(T ) were obtained, as
explained in Section 2, and are shown in Table 2. Sta-
tistical errors in k1(T ) result from a least squares anal-
ysis of the pseudo ﬁrst order rate coeﬃcient multiplied
by the Student-t factor corresponding to the 95% conﬁ-
dence limit. The errors given in Table 2 include as well a
contribution of systematic errors, estimated to be about
15%, which essentially come from uncertainties in mass
ﬂows or pressure gauge calibrations and ﬂuctuations in
the temperature and concentration of methanol. The to-
tal gas densities are also listed in Table 2. Note that the
study of any pressure dependence of the rate coeﬃcient
is not possible for a single Laval nozzle operating with
a speciﬁc bath gas and at a ﬁxed temperature. Never-
theless, no pressure dependence of k1(T ) seems to ex-
ist at ultra-low temperatures, according to Shannon et
al. (2013), so the results obtained for the temperatures
employed in this work at diﬀerent gas densities can be
compared.
The rate coeﬃcients k1(T ) obtained in this work be-
tween 22 and 64 K are depicted in Fig. 2 in a log − log
form. It is seen that k1(T ) increases as the temperature

ture range 22-64 K to the expression:

(10)
where k1(T ) has units of cm3 molecule−1 s−1. The ex-
trapolation of Equation (10) to a temperature of 10 K, of
interest for cold dark clouds such as B1-b, yields a value
of 1.1×10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. It is worth noting that
for the present limited experimental temperature range,
several mathematical expressions give fairly acceptable
ﬁts. However, for some of these expressions the extrap-
olation beyond the experimental temperature range, es-
pecially at temperatures signiﬁcantly below 22 K, can
diverge or result in unrealistic rate coeﬃcients. Future
works, which require the construction of new Laval noz-
zles, are planned to extend the present temperature range
in order to better constrain the dependence with temper-
ature of k1.

For comparison purposes, values of k1 reported at tem-
peratures higher than 56 K are depicted in Fig. 3. The
methanol reactivity toward OH radicals at 22 K is en-
hanced by almost two orders of magnitude compared to
200 K (G´omez Mart´ın et al. 2014). The negative temper-
ature dependence of k1(T ) was already observed by Shan-
non et al. (2013) and G´omez Mart´ın et al. (2014) in the
56-202 K range. Nevertheless, the values of k1(T ) previ-
ously determined by these authors using a pulsed Laval
nozzle are around twice higher than ours in the temper-
ature range common to these authors and us (close to 60
K). The source of this discrepancy is presently unknown
and should deserve more experimental attention. The
good agreement observed in the present study employ-
ing two independent CRESU machines shed conﬁdence
to the values reported here. Furthermore, the trend ob-
served in this work between 22 and 64 K is consistent
with the results obtained by G´omez Mart´ın et al. (2014)
between 123 and 202 K using a classical ﬂow tube cou-

pled to a PLP-LIF technique.

At temperatures between 210 and 866 K the trend in
the temperature dependence of k1(T ) is inverted, show-
ing a positive temperature dependence (Atkinson et al.
2006). This opposite behaviour yields a ”U-shape” in the
log k1(T ) versus T plots, already observed for other re-
actions of OH with complex organic molecules (Jim´enez
et al. 2015a,b; Shannon et al. 2010, 2014; Caravan et al.
2015). At ultra-low temperatures, the reaction mecha-
nism that allows this to occur is one in which an adduct
is formed by a weak hydrogen-bonded association of
OH and methanol followed by quantum-mechanical tun-
nelling, as suggested by Shannon et al. (2013). Recently,
Hernandez et al. (2015) reported experimental evidence
of the formation of the hydrogen bonded intermediate
OH··· CH3OH by He Nanodroplet Isolation (HENDI)
and a combination of mass spectrometry and infrared
laser Stark spectroscopy.

3.4. Predicted gas-phase abundance of CH3O

As stated in Section 1, the reaction of OH with CH3OH
may have important implications for interstellar chem-
istry since it acts as a sink of methanol and a source
of CH3O radicals. In particular, here we are interested
in evaluating whether this reaction can explain the ob-
served abundance of CH3O in the cold dense core B1-b,
∼ 5 × 10−12 relative to H2 or ∼ 3 × 10−3 with respect to
CH3OH (Cernicharo et al. 2012).

Figure 4 shows the time evolution of the predicted
fractional abundances of the reactants involved in re-
action (1), OH and CH3OH, and the reaction prod-
uct CH3O for two diﬀerent densities of H nuclei.
It
is seen that methanol reaches its maximum abundance
soon after a few 104 yr (remember that the abun-
dance of CH3OH has been ﬁxed to 6 × 10−5 relative
to CO), while the methoxy radical increases its abun-
dance progressively until reaching the maximum at late
times. The range of abundances of CH3O relative to
methanol, n(CH3O)/n(CH3OH), achieved within a time
range between 105 yr and 107 yr are listed in Ta-
ble 3. Our chemical model predicts that at ∼ 107 yr,
n(CH3O)/n(CH3OH) reaches a value of 2 × 10−3 or
0.6 × 10−3, depending on the adopted density of H nu-
clei. This ratio is somewhat lower, although of the same

order, than the one observed in B1-b. The main uncer-
tainty in the calculated CH3O/CH3OH abundance ratio
arises from the depletion rate of CH3O, which in turn
depends on the rate coeﬃcients of the reactions of CH3O
with H and O atoms and on the abundances of H and O
atoms, both species being very diﬃcult to observe in cold
dense clouds. Nonetheless, with current constraints on
the destruction rate of CH3O, the title reaction is rapid
enough at low temperatures to provide an eﬃcient pure
gas-phase pathway to CH3O radicals in B1-b. Thus, our
results indicate that gas-phase formation of CH3O via re-
action (1), even though it does not fully interpret the ob-
served abundance of methoxy radicals in B-1b, is likely to
be a major contributor. Up to now, it is thought that the
main competing process of formation of CH3O is its syn-
thesis on grain surfaces and further non-thermal desorp-
tion to the gas phase. As Cernicharo et al. (2012) pointed
out, experiments that simulate ice mantle processing by
ultraviolet or ion irradiation indicate that it is not the
CH3O isomer, but the more stable isomer CH2OH, which
is formed on grain surfaces. This was proven by Chen et
al. (2013), who observed CH2OH in the X-ray irradiation
of methanol ice at 14 K. The warming up of these ices
produces ethylene glycol (CH2OH)2 indicating that the
abundance of CH2OH radicals is high. More recently,
Lee et al. (2015) observed that CH3O formed in the 355
nm irradiation of a p-H2 matrix containing methyl nitrite
(CH3ONO) at 3.2 K is rapidly converted into CH2OH.
These authors theoretically predict that the conversion
of CH3O to CH2OH on grain surfaces may occur in two
steps:

CH3O + H2 → CH3OH + H,
CH3OH + H → CH2OH + H2.

(11)

(12)

In light of these results, the formation of CH3O through
grain-surface processes seems to be disfavoured, although
more laboratory experiments and/or quantum chemistry
calculations are needed to draw deﬁnitive conclusions.

3.4.1. Comparison with previous chemical models

In Table 3, some input parameters used in previous
chemical models and the predicted abundances of CH3O
are listed for comparison purposes. The ﬁrst column of
the table indicates whether or not the model includes
grain surface production of CH3O radicals and the sec-
ond column provides the density of H nuclei adopted in
each model. As can be seen in the third column, the
rate coeﬃcient k1(10 K) used in previous models, either
4 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 (measured by Shannon et
al. 2013 at 63 K) or 3× 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 (colli-
sion limit), diﬀers by almost one order of magnitude. The
fourth column gives the range of CH3O/CH3OH abun-
dance ratios predicted by each model over a certain time
interval, indicated in the ﬁfth column.

Our results are consistent with those of Vasyunin &
Herbst (2013) when grain-surface production of CH3O
is switched oﬀ in their model and reaction (1) be-
comes the only eﬃcient formation route to CH3O. The
CH3O/CH3OH abundance ratios reported by Vasyunin
& Herbst (2013) are around or slightly above 10−3, while
ours are around or slightly below 10−3. Balucani et al.
(2015) do only consider gas-phase formation of CH3O
with k1(10 K) = 3 × 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 and ﬁnd

7
a CH3O/CH3OH abundance ratio of ∼ 4 × 10−2, about
10 times higher than the value observed in B1-b, over a
restricted time interval around 105 yr.

As seen in Table 3, a common outcome of models that
consider formation of CH3O on grain surfaces (Vasyunin
& Herbst 2013; Ruaud et al. 2015; Acharyya et al. 2015)
is a signiﬁcant overestimation of the CH3O/CH3OH
abundance ratio with respect to the observed value in
B1-b. This fact points to an overestimation in the for-
mation eﬃciency of CH3O through grain-surface routes,
which is consistent with the empirical conclusion that
CH3O is not predominantly formed on grains surfaces.
It must be noted that the eﬃciency of the grain-surface
processes invoked to explain the formation of CH3O is
highly uncertain.

In the chemical models of Vasyunin & Herbst (2013)
and Ruaud et al. (2015), CH3O is assumed to be formed
mainly on the surface of dust grains through successive
hydrogenations of CO. Methoxy radicals are assumed to
be further ejected to the gas phase through chemical des-
orption, which assumes that a fraction, typically 1%, of
the energy released by exothermic chemical reactions on
grain surfaces is used by the products to desorb. In the
chemical model of Ruaud et al. (2015), CH3O is also
formed through a mechanism involving the formation of
van der Waals complexes between carbon atoms collid-
ing with dust grains and water ice molecules. In these
two chemical models, the formation of CH3O through
the gas-phase reaction of OH and CH3OH was included
although grain-surface processes are found to dominate
the formation of CH3O. The gas-phase production rate
of CH3O is similar in both models, although the deple-
tion of CH3O through reactions with H and O atoms is
assumed to be faster in the model of Vasyunin & Herbst
(2013). This makes that, as seen in Table 3, the values of
n(CH3O)/n(CH3OH) predicted by Ruaud et al. (2015)
are higher than those calculated by Vasyunin & Herbst
(2013).

Acharyya et al. (2015) modelled the fractional abun-
dance of CH3O using an updated gas-grain chemical
model that included the gas-phase reaction of OH with
methanol (reaction 1) and with some other organic
molecules. These authors run the model with and with-
out reaction (1) and concluded that at 10 K this reac-
tion is not generally an eﬀective destruction route for
CH3OH, although it leads to an increase in the abun-
dance of CH3O at times longer than 2×105 yr. The main
competing process of formation of gas-phase CH3O in
this model is the hydrogenation of formaldehyde on grain
surfaces followed by non-thermal desorption. Clearly, in
this model the CH3O/CH3OH abundance ratio is largely
overestimated with respect to the observed value in B1-
b, probably as a consequence of a too eﬃcient formation
of CH3O via grain-surface routes.

4. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have determined the rate coeﬃcient
k1 for the gas-phase reaction between OH radicals and
CH3OH in the range of temperatures between 22 and 64
K. This study provides the ﬁrst measurement of k1 at
temperatures below 56 K. The lowest temperature inves-
tigated here, 22 K, is the closest one to that in B1-b at
which the rate coeﬃcient of the reaction between OH and
CH3OH has been measured. In the cold environment of

B1-b, CH3O (product of the reaction between OH and
CH3OH) has been detected recently. The consistency of
the measured rate coeﬃcients in two diﬀerent laborato-
ries (UCLM and UR1) leads us conﬁdence in the reported
k1(T ), especially around 60 K where there is some dis-
crepancy with previous data. We ﬁt the measured rate
coeﬃcients as a function of temperature and provide an
expression of k1(T ) in the temperature range 22-64 K.
Further measurements of k1 at temperatures below 22
K are needed to corroborate whether this reaction con-
tinues to be accelerated at even lower temperatures and
to constrain by how much in order to better evaluate its
contribution to the production of CH3O in cold dense
clouds such as B1-b. In addition, there is still a gap to
ﬁll between 64 and 123 K, which is planned to be cov-
ered in the near future with new Laval nozzles that will
help to elucidate the kinetic behaviour at intermediate
temperatures. Finally, we will intend to detect CH3O
radicals formed in the reaction of OH with methanol at
22 K by LIF. This is planned to be done in the near fu-
ture, since some changes are needed in the experimental
system to detect CH3O.

We have also modeled the chemistry of CH3O in cold
dense clouds considering that it is only formed through
the gas-phase reaction of OH and CH3OH. We have
adopted the extrapolated value of k1(T ) at 10 K and
assumed that gas-phase reactions with H and O atoms
are the only removal processes of CH3O. This model pre-
dicts CH3O/CH3OH abundance ratios that are similar or
slightly below the value observed in B1-b (∼ 3 × 10−3),

conﬁrming that the reaction of OH and CH3OH is clearly
involved in the formation of interstellar methoxy radicals.
This is consistent with recent experiments that indicate
that CH2OH, rather than CH3O, is the isomer formed on
icy grain mantles. Nonetheless, the role of grain-surface
processes on the chemistry of CH3O needs to be further
investigated. Probably a search for the more stable iso-
mer, CH2OH, in cold dense clouds may shed light on
the relative role of gas-phase and grain-surface chemical
reactions in the synthesis of methanol-derived radicals.
Up to date, the rotational spectrum of CH2OH has not
been yet accurately measured in the laboratory, which
complicates the detection in the interstellar medium.
