We study topological properties of one-dimensional nonlinear bichromatic superlattices and unveil
the eﬀect of nonlinearity on topological states. We ﬁnd the existence of nontrivial edge solitions,
which distribute on the boundaries of the lattice with their chemical potential located in the linear
gap regime and are sensitive to the phase parameter of the superlattice potential. We further
demonstrate that the topological property of the nonlinear Bloch bands can be characterized by
topological Chern numbers deﬁned in the extended two-dimensional parameter space. In addition,
we discuss that the composition relations between the nolinear Bloch waves and gap solitions for
the nonlinear superlattices. The stabilities of edge solitons are also studied.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, there are growing eﬀorts in study-
ing one-dimensional (1D) periodic and quasiperiodic su-
perlattice systems with nontrivial topological properties,
which can be experimentally realized in cold atomic sys-
tems and photonic systems [1–4]. The 1D optical super-
lattice can be produced by superimposing two 1D opti-
cal lattices with diﬀerent wavelengths [2, 3]. Recently,
it was shown that the 1D optical superlattice systems
can exhibit rich topological phases [5–10]. Additionally,
nontrivial topological edge states in 1D photonic qua-
sicrystals have also been observed experimentally [4]. As
the topological properties of the 1D noninteracting su-
perlattice systems can be understood from their band
structures, it is interesting to study the interaction eﬀect
on the edge states of the bosonic superlattice systems,
particularly, for the weakly interacting bosonic system in
which the eﬀect of interactions between bosons can be
eﬀectively described by nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation.
In the scheme of mean ﬁeld theory, it is well known
that the interactions between bosons can result in the
signiﬁcant nonlinearity in a periodic Bose system. In the
presence of both the nonlinearity and periodicity, there
exist two kinds of important waves, namely nonlinear
Bloch waves and gap solitons. While Bloch waves are
intrinsic to periodic systems and are extensive over the
whole space, nonlinearity has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
their stabilities [11]. The instabilities are responsible for
the formation of the train of localized ﬁlaments [12] and
are closely related to the breakdown of superﬂuidity [13].
Gap solitons are spatially localized wave packets with
the chemical potentials in the linear band gaps [14]. Ac-
cording to the locations of their chemical potential, gap
solitons can be divided into several classes. For example,

when the chemical potentials are in the linear band gaps,
the localized wave packets have a major peak well local-
ized within a unit cell, and are called the fundamental gap
soliton [15]. It has been shown that there exists a compo-
sition relation between them: Bloch waves at either the
center or edge of the Brillouin zone are inﬁnite chains
composed of fundamental gap solitons [16]. In this work,
we shall study the eﬀect of nonlinearity on the topological
properties of 1D bichromatic superlattices. The interest-
ing questions include whether the topological states in
the noninteracting limit can survive in the presence of
nonlinearity, and whether the gap solitons can be formed
in the bichromatic superlattice systems? If the gap so-
litions exsit, what are their relations to the topological
states and whether a composition relation between the
nolinear Bloch waves and gap solitions still holds ture?

To answer these questions, we study the interacting bo-
son system trapped in a 1D optical superlattice, which
is described by a nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation in a 1D
bichromatic periodic potential. By numerically solving
the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation under the periodic
boundary condition, we ﬁnd the existence of nonlinear
Bloch waves, which form a nonlinear Bloch band adiabat-
ically connected to the topological Bloch band in the non-
interacting limit. For the system under the open bound-
ary condition, we ﬁnd the existence of edge gap solitons
and discuss their stabilities. The edge gap soliton can be
viewed as a reminiscence of the topologically nontrivial
edge state for the noninteracting bichromatic superlat-
tice. We verify the existence of a series of gap solitons
for the system under the periodic boundary condition,
and the composition relations between the nolinear Bloch
waves and gap solitions are also discussed. The paper is
organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the theoret-
ical model and show how the 1D bichromatic superlattice
system can be mapped to the Harper-Hofstadter prob-
lem.
III, we ﬁrst present the spectrum of the
nonlinear superlattice system in the subsection A. The
edge states and the topological properties of the non-

We consider a weakly interacting Bose gas loaded in
1D optical superlattice conﬁned in [−L/2, L/2]. On the

by the following nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation

where v1 and v2 are the potential strength, α is a rational

perlattices have been realized in cold atomic experiments
[1–3]. Besides, the nonlinear periodic systems can also be
realized in nonlinear waveguide arrays [17, 18] and opti-
cally induced lattices [19].

Despite the existence of nonlinearity, Eq.

the periodic boundary condition still has the Bloch wave
solutions Ψ (x) = eikxψk (x), where k is the Bloch wave
vector. For the system with α = 1/q and q being a
positive integer, the Bloch wave state ψk (x) is a periodic
function, which fulﬁlls ψk (x) = ψk (x + a) with a = 1/α
being the period of potential function V (x). From the
Schr¨odinger equation (1), we have the following equation
for each Bloch wave state ψk (x)

Iterating the above step several times, we
can ﬁnd the stable eigenvalue and eigenstate. For the
nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (1), the diﬀerent interval
is taken to [−L/2, L/2], where L is the region of periodic
potential V (x). For the nonlinear Bloch equation (3), the
diﬀerent interval is taken to [0, a].

When v2 is much smaller than v1, the potential V2(x)
can be taken as a perturbation in Eq. (1). In the case of
the large potential strength v1, the low-energy orbitals
are localized in the unit cell of the periodic potential
V1(x). Their hopping integrals involving second or fur-
ther apart neighbors are negligible. The above model can
be eﬀectively described by a tight-binding model with pe-
riodic on-site potentials [21]

However, under the open boundary condition, the mo-

As there are no analytic solutions for the above two

cal methods have been used to solve them [20]. A very
practical method we used in the present work is as the
following. The equations are ﬁrst solved by ﬁnite dif-
ference method in the linear case (g = 0) to obtain the
eigenvalue and eigenstate. Then the eigenstate is brought
back to the equation with the eﬀective potential function

of c = 0, the tight-binding model [Eq. (4)] reduces to
the well-known Aubry-Andr´e (AA) model [22] or Harper-
Hofstadter model [23, 24]. The topological properties
of the AA model have been unveiled in Ref.
[4, 5] by
demonstrating the existence of nontrivial edge states and
topological invariants in the two-dimensional parameter
space through dimensional extension.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Energy spectrum

In the noninteracting tight-binding limit, it is known
that the spectrum of the superlattice system for vari-
ous α exhibits the butterﬂy structure as the system de-
scribed by Eq. (4) with c = 0 can be mapped to the
Hofstadter model [5, 24]. To see how the structure of
energy spectrum of the superlattice system is aﬀected by
the nonlinear term, we numerically solve the the nonlin-
ear Schr¨odinger equation (1) under the open boundary
condition and plot the energy spectrum of Eq. (1) ver-
sus diﬀerent α with the interacting parameter g = 12 in
Fig. 1. The other parameters are taken to be v1 = 16,
v2 = 0.02v1 and L = 34, and the natural unit is used,
i.e.  = m = 1. We shall keep this set of parameters
ﬁxed in the following discussion. The energy spectrums
of the 1D nonlinear superlattice system shows the similar
butterﬂy structure as the spectrum of the noninteracting
1D superlattice system [5]. The basic structures shown
in Fig. 1 (a) and (b), corresponding to diﬀerent phases
δ = 0 and δ = π/4, are quite similar. In the band gap
regions of the butterﬂy structure, there are some isolated
points which are corresponding to the edge states. The
position of the edge state is dependent on the value of δ.

The energy spectrum of the nonlinear superlattice sys-
tem displays similar structure as the corresponding non-
interacting system [5]. To see it clearly, we consider the 3-

3

period superlattice system and solve the nonlinear equa-
tions [Eqs. (1) and (3)] with α = 1/3, δ = 0.22π and
g = 12. The energy spectrum for the Bloch equation
[Eq. (3)] is shown in Fig. 2(a). In the presence of the
nonlinear term, the nonlinearity lifts the Bloch bands into
gap regions of linear bands. When g decreased to zero,
the nonlinear bands move down continuously to their
noninteracting limit. For the system under open bound-
ary condition, the corresponding eigenvalues of nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation (1) in ascending order also form
three energy bands shown in Fig. 2(b). The nonlinear
bands marked by ’cross’ originate from the linear band
marked by ’circle’.

B. Edge Solitons and Topological invariant

As shown in Fig. 2, it is interesting to see that two
states Ψ11, Ψ12 appear in the ﬁrst nonlinear band gap
and the state Ψ23 appears in the second nonlinear band
gap, where we have used the subscript n to represent the
n-th eigenstate Ψn in ascending order. Similar to the
non-interaction case, these three states are edge states
with the wave functions localized at the left or right
boundaries, as shown in Fig. 3 (marked by red thick
solid lines). The formations of these edge states are due
to the interplay between the kinetic energy, the nonlin-
ear interaction and the conﬁned periodic potential. For
convenience, we call these edge state as edge solitons.

To understand the origin of the edge solitons in nonlin-
ear bichromatic superlattices in an intuitive way, we plot
the periodic potentials V1(x) (blue solid lines) and V2(x)
(blue dashed lines) in Fig. 3. Since we are interested in
the low energy states, the bottom of V2(x) is important.
Near the bottom of V2(x), the potential of unit cell can
be approximated by the parabolic potential. Considering
the periodicity of V2(x), we obtain a serial of parabolas
shown in Fig. 3 by black solid lines. Under the parabolic
approximation, the Schr¨odinger equation (1) remains un-
changed when we shift the vertex of a parabola at x0 a
period to x0 ± a, if the vertex is away from the boundary.
When the interacting bosons are conﬁned in a parabola,
the particles are in a series of the discrete eigenstates.
A substitution of one parabola with the other parabola
only shifts the parabola and wave function, and does not
change its energy dramatically. This holds true until the
parabola touches the boundary. In such case, the walls
and the parabola provide the main conﬁnement. The
particles now sit in a roughly triangular potential well.
Due to the stronger conﬁnement, the energy levels will be
elevated and higher than the corresponding levels in the
middle. The corresponding states are squeezed against
the side of the wall and the degeneracies are lost.

Under the parabolic approximation, we solve the non-
linear Schr¨odinger equation [Eq. (1)] and obtain the or-
bital wave functions of edge parabola shown in Fig. 3
(green dashed lines). Comparing the red solid lines and
the green dashed lines in Fig. 3, the orbital wave func-

how these states can be induced by the parabolas and the
walls. The y coordinates show the amplitudes of the wave
functions Ψ(x) and Φ(x). In order to show the periodic po-
tential V1(x) and V2(x) in this ﬁgure, the amplitudes of V1(x)
and V2(x) are been multiplied two rates 0.00375 and 0.15 re-
spectively. From top to bottom, the red thick solid lines repre-
sent three edge states of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation
(1) [(a): Ψ11(x), (b): Ψ12(x) and (c): Ψ23(x)]. The green
dashed lines show the wave functions Φ(x) of the nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation (1) under the parabolic approximation.
The periodic potential V1(x) are shown by the blue solid lines.

tential V2(x). The 2th-periodic potential V2(x) forms several

tions are found to coincide with the edge solitons well.
For the three edge gap solitons, the wave functions lo-
calize on the boundary and trail a long tail. For the
former two edge gap solitons, i.e., Ψ11 in Fig. 3 (a) and
Ψ12 in Fig. 3 (b), their chemical potentials are in the
ﬁrst band gap, and the corresponding wave functions de-
velop from the ground states of the right and left edge
parabola, respectively. The right edge parabola of the
Ψ11 includes two lattice of V1(x). So the wave function
shows two peaks with the same sign. However, the left
edge parabola of the Ψ12 includes one lattice of V1(x).
So the wave function shows only one peak. The left edge
parabola for Ψ12 is closer to the left wall than the right
edge parabola for Ψ11 in the right side, it gives a strong
conﬁnement of the particles. So the chemical potential of
Ψ12 is higher than that of Ψ11. For the edge gap solitons
Ψ23 in Fig. 3 (c), the parabola of this state is the same
as that of Ψ11 in Fig. 3 (a). However their chemical po-
tential is in the second band gap and the state develops
from the ﬁrst excited state. So the wave function also
shows two peaks. One is positive and the other one is
negative.

FIG. 4. Nonlinear energies vary with the phase δ for Eq. (1)
with the parameter (a) α = 1/3, (b) α = 1/4 under open
boundary conditions. The interaction parameters are taken
as g = 5.

As the phase δ changes from 0 to 2π, the spectrum
of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (1) for a given α
changes periodically. The position of the edge states in
the gaps also varies continuously with the change of the
phase δ. In Fig. 4, we show the spectrum of the super-
lattice systems with α = 1/3 and 1/4 versus δ under the
open boundary condition. The shade parts correspond to
the band regions and the lines between bands represent
the spectra of edge states. The position of the edge states
in the gaps varies continuously with the change of δ. In
particular, the level continuously connects the upper and
lower energy bands.

In general, the appearance of edge states is attributed
to the nontrivial topological property of the bulk sys-
tem, whose topological structure can be characterized by
a topological invariant [25, 26]. To see this clearly for
the problem considered in this work, we also explore the
topological properties of the nonlinear Bloch band un-
der the periodic boundary condition. For the present
nonlinear periodic system, the wave vector k of non-
linear Bloch function can be changed form 0 to 2π/q
and the phase δ can also be varied from 0 to 2π adi-
abatically, we therefore get a manifold of Hamiltonian
H(k, δ) in the space (k, δ). An eﬀective 2D Brillouin
zone with respect to the Bloch vector k and the poten-
tial shift δ forms a T 2 torus in the two directions. For
eigenstates ψ(k, δ) of Bloch equation (3), the Chern num-
ber is used to characterize their topological properties.
The Chern number is a topological invariant which can
be calculated via C = 1
0 dδ[∂kAδ − ∂δAk],
where Ak is the Berry connection deﬁned by Ak =
ihψ(k)|∂k|ψ(k)i. Similarly, we can deﬁne the Berry con-
nection Aδ = ihψ(k, δ)|∂δ|ψ(k, δ)i. To calculate it, we
follow the method in Ref.
[27] to directly perform the
lattice computation of the Chern number. For the sys-

tem with α = 1/3, we ﬁnd that the Chern numbers in
the three sub-band are 1, −2 and 1, respectively, for both
the linear (g = 0) and nonlinear (g > 0) cases.

Besides the nonlinear Bloch waves, the nonlinear peri-
odic system has another kind of solutions known as gap
soliton solutions, which are spatially localized waves with
the chemical potentials in the linear band gaps [14]. It
is found that the gap solitons and the nonlinear Wan-
nier functions match very well. The match gets better
as the periodic potential gets stronger [16, 28]. The ex-
cellent match between the gap solitons and the nonlinear
Wannier functions suggests that the gap solitons be ap-
proximated by the the orbital wave functions of a unit
cell since the the orbital wave functions can be taken
as the Wannier functions when the periodic potential is
stronger. As discussed in Refs. [16, 28–30], gap solitons
develop in the linear band gaps and originate from the
stable bound states of a single periodic well. So they can
be divided diﬀerent family according to the locations of
the band gaps. On the other hand, the nonlinear Bloch
band can be viewed as a lifted linear Bloch band by in-
creasing the nonlinear interaction. However, the linear
Bloch band can be viewed as an evolution from the dis-
crete energy levels of an individual well. In particular, the
gap solitons match the Wannier function well when the
periodic potential is strong. Therefore, the gap solitons
and nonlinear Bloch waves should share certain common
features, which is called the ‘composition relation’ [31].
In this subsection, we shall explore the gap solitons in
the superlattice system and their composition relations
with the nonlinear Bloch waves.

We solve the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation [Eq. (1)]
directly to obtain the gap solitons shown in Fig. 5 (black
solid lines). Under the parabolic approximation, we fur-
ther solve the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation [Eq. (1)]
to obtain the orbital wave functions of the corresponding
parabola shown in Fig. 5 (red dashed lines). The chemi-
cal potentials are in three diﬀerent band gaps from low to
high. The states by two diﬀerent methods coincide well.
The good match indicates that they have the same origin.
For the gap soliton in Fig. 5 (a), its chemical potential
is in the ﬁrst band gap. This state originates from the
the ground state of the parabola. So the wave function
has a main peak. However, the width of the parabola
extends two period of V1(x). So the wave function has
two extra little peaks. The chemical potential of the gap
soliton in Fig. 5 (b) is in the second band gap. This state
originates from the the ﬁrst excited state of the parabola.
So one little peak in the wave function changes a sign.
The gap soliton in Fig. 5 (c) originates from the second
excited state of the parabola and its chemical potential
is in the second band gap. Both of the two little peaks in
the wave function change the sign. Our results show the
existence of a series of gap solitons which originate from

Our numerical results support that the gap soliton are
really fundamental and can be viewed as building blocks
for other stationary solutions of a nonlinear periodic sys-
tem, such as high-order gap solitons. Under the periodic
boundary condition, we solve the nonlinear Bloch equa-
tion (3) to obtain the nonlinear Bloch waves shown in
Fig. 5 by blue dotted lines. The chemical potentials is
set to be same as that of the corresponding gap solitons,
and the wave vectors are are taken at the center of the
Brillouin zone (k = 0). Comparing the nonlinear Bloch
waves and the corresponding gap solitons in Fig. 5, we
notice that the two waves match very well within the
single parabola. So a Bloch wave at the center of the
Brillouin zone can be viewed as a chain of gap solitons
pieced together.

D. Stability

In this subsection, we shall study the stability of the
edge solitons against the interaction strength following
the standard procedure [32–34]. Since the unstable so-
lution is sensitive to a small perturbation, we can add a
small perturbation ∆Ω(x, t) to a known stationary solu-
tion Ω(x) of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation (1)

Ψ(x, t) = [Ω(x) + ∆Ω(x, t)] exp(−iµt),

where ∆Ω(x, t) = u(x) exp(iλt) + w∗(x) exp(−iλ∗t). In-
serting the perturbation into time-dependent nonlin-

linear eigenfunction (5). If all eigenvalues λ are real, the
solution of Ω(x) is stable. On the other hand, if there
exists a ﬁnite imaginary part, the solution of Ω(x) would
be unstable.

The stabilities of the gap solitons have been discussed
in Refs.
[16, 28–30] for several interacting periodic sys-
tems. Here, we focus our study on the stabilities of the
edge solitons in bichromatic superlattices. The stabil-
ities of the edge gap solitons are displayed in Fig. 6.
For the non-interaction case (g = 0), the three edge gap
solitons are reduced to the stationary solutions of linear
Schr¨odinger equation. When the interaction strength g
is increased, the three states will change from stable to
unstable. The reason is that the conﬁnement of the edge

6

parabola is not strong enough to compensate the repul-
sive interaction and the kinetic energy. For the state Ψ11
in Fig. 6 (a), it is stable when g < 5. However, Ψ12 be-
comes unstable when g > 1 in Fig. 6 (b). This is due to
the strong conﬁnement of the left parabola to the parti-
cles which increases the kinetic energy and the repulsive
interaction. For the edge gap soliton Ψ23 in Fig. 6 (c),
it is still stable when g = 12. The reason is that Ψ23
originates from the ﬁrst excited state of the right edge
parabola. The half-width of the wave function is larger
than the former states Ψ11 and Ψ12. So it has a low par-
ticle density which results the interactive energy is less
than the former.

IV. SUMMARY

In summary, we explored nontrivial topological states
in 1D nonlinear superlattice systems. Our study reveals
that the nonlinear systems exhibit similar spectrum as
the corresponding linear system and support the exis-
tence of topologically nontrivial edge gap solitons. We
unveiled the topological nature of the nonlinear Bloch
bands by calculating the topological invariants of these
bands. With the linear stability analysis, it is found that
the edge gap solitons is stable when the nonlinear in-
teraction is not strong enough. Our numerical results
also verify that the composition relations between the
gap solitons and nonlinear Bloch waves still hold true
in the nonlinear superlattice systems. Our results will
be helpful for understanding the eﬀect of nonlinearity on
topological states and exploring topologically nontrivial
states in optical superlattice systems.
