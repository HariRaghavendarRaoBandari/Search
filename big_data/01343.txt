Dynamic heterogeneity in two-dimensional
supercooled liquids: comparison of bond-breaking
and bond-orientational correlations

Abstract. We compare the spatial correlations of bond-breaking events and bond-
orientational relaxation in a model two-dimensional
liquid undergoing Newtonian
dynamics. We ﬁnd that the relaxation time of the bond-breaking correlation function
is much longer than the relaxation time of the bond-orientational correlation function
and self-intermediate scattering function. However, the relaxation time of the
bond-orientational correlation function increases faster with decreasing temperature
than the relaxation time of the bond-breaking correlation function and the self-
intermediate scattering function. Moreover, the dynamic correlation length that
characterizes the size of correlated bond-orientational relaxation grows faster with
decreasing temperature than the dynamic correlation length that characterizes the
size of correlated bond-breaking events. We also examine the ensemble-dependent
and ensemble-independent dynamic susceptibilities for both bond-breaking correlations
and bond-orientational correlations. We ﬁnd that for both correlations, the ensemble-
dependent and ensemble-independent susceptibilities exhibit a maximum at nearly the
same time, and this maximum occurs at a time slightly shorter than the peak position
of the dynamic correlation length.

1. Introduction

One of the most studied features of glassy dynamics is the existence of transient
domains in which particles move in a correlated fashion, either much farther or much
less than expected from a Gaussian distribution of displacements [1]. A connection
between this dynamic heterogeneity and the structure was established in studies of the
isoconﬁgurational ensemble in two-dimensions [2].
In these studies the same initial
structure was used in many simulation runs, with the velocities chosen randomly from
a Boltzmann distribution.
It was found that there were regions where the particles
were more likely to move farther than in other regions, and thus some aspects of the
local structure were associated with the domains of heterogeneous dynamics. The exact
nature of these aspects of the local structure is, however, not clear.

Recently it has been shown that there is a large diﬀerence in the growth of the
characteristic size of dynamically heterogeneous regions upon supercooling in two and
three dimensions if one deﬁnes dynamic heterogeneity through particle displacements
[3]. This diﬀerence is mirrored in strong ﬁnite size eﬀects in the quantities that probe
translational motion of the tagged particle, e.g. the self-intermediate scattering function
and the mean-square displacement, in two-dimensional glass forming liquids. Despite the
diﬀerence in the tagged particle dynamics, there may be other dynamic observables that
exhibit similar behavior in two and three dimensions. One can gain insight into potential
observables that might exhibit similar behavior when one considers the dimensional
dependence of the formation of ordered solids [4]. Similar to the glass transition, this
freezing transition is also a transition from a liquid state where the shear modulus is zero,
to a state with non-zero shear modulus. In three dimensions long-range translational and
rotational order emerges when an ordered solid forms, but in two dimensions only long-
range rotational order emerges when an ordered solid forms. Thus, in two-dimensional
ordered solids, bond-orientational order should be monitored to look for the emergence
of an elastic solid. When comparing the glass transition in two and three dimensions
one may want to examine quantities that are expected to be similar in studies of the
formation of two-dimensional and three-dimensional ordered solids, and this leads to
examining correlations between bonds connecting neighboring particles.

Yamamoto and Onuki [5, 6] examined spatial correlations of bond-breaking events
in a two-dimensional glassy binary mixture. They found large regions in which bond-
breaking events were correlated by examining four-point structure factors in which the
so-called weight function [7] was determined by bond-breaking events. Subsequently,
Shiba, Kawasaki, and Onuki [8] compared bond-breaking correlations and mobility
correlations in two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. They concluded that
the vibrational modes made a signiﬁcant contribution to mobility correlations in two-
dimensional liquids, but the contribution from vibrational modes was much smaller in
three dimensions. Furthermore, the vibrational modes did not signiﬁcantly contribute
to the bond-breaking correlation function in two or three dimensions. These results
suggest that to compare supercooled dynamics in two and three dimensions one should
examine bond-breaking events.

Such a study has recently been performed by Shiba, Kawasaki, and Kim [9].
They examined mobility correlations and bond-breaking correlations in two and three
dimensions. They found that the characteristic lengths determined from bond-
breaking and mobility correlations are comparable in three dimensions, but the mobility
correlations are much more spatially extended than the bond breaking correlations in two
dimensions. Furthermore, there were large ﬁnite size eﬀects in the mobility correlations
in two dimensions, but no ﬁnite size eﬀects were seen for bond-breaking correlations
in two dimensions. There were no reported ﬁnite size eﬀects in three dimensions for
mobility or bond-breaking correlations.

Another observable that may have similar behavior in two- and three-dimensional
supercooled liquids is bond-orientational correlations. We showed earlier that bond-

Dynamic heterogeneity lengths in two dimensions

orientational relaxation times are decoupled from translational relaxation times in
two dimensions [3]. Speciﬁcally, bond-orientational relaxation times grow faster with
decreasing temperature than translational relaxation times. This is analogous to
the decoupling of the bond-orientational and translational ordering in ordered two-
dimensional solids. However, there has been no detailed comparison of the growth of the
spatial correlations of bond-breaking events and bond-orientational relaxation in two-
dimensional supercooled liquids. Here we examine spatial correlations of bond-breaking
events and bond-orientational relaxation in a model two-dimensional supercooled liquid.

2. Simulations

of length is σAA, the unit of temperature is kB/AA, and the unit of time is(cid:112)mσ2

where rij is the distance between particle i and j, and α and β denotes the type of
particle. We denote the majority species as the A particles and the minority species
as the B particles; the potential parameters are given by BB = 0.5AA, AB = 1.5AA,
σBB = 0.88σAA, and σAB = 0.8σAA. We present results in reduced units, where the unit
AA/AA.
The mass for both species are the same, and the number density is ρ = 1.2. We
simulated N = 250, 000 particles at T = 1.0, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.5. For T = 0.45 we
simulated 10 000, 250 000 and 4 million particle systems. While no ﬁnite size eﬀects
where found for the bond-orientational and bond-breaking correlation functions, there
are ﬁnite size eﬀects for the self-intermediate scattering function for T = 0.45; the 4
million particle system is needed to remove those ﬁnite size eﬀects [3]. Due to the large
bond-breaking relaxation times, the simulations were much longer than in previous work:
we ran the production runs for at least 50τB for T ≥ 0.5 where τB is deﬁned in Section
3. At the lowest temperature, T = 0.45, the production runs were 20 times longer
than the longest runs used in the previous work. For every temperature we ran four
productions runs. The simulations were run in the NVT ensemble with a Nos´e-Hoover
thermostat using HOOMD-blue [11]. Importantly, we note that these simulations evolve
according to Newtonian dynamics. For two-dimensional systems, it has been shown that
the underlying dynamics inﬂuences the characteristic size of dynamically heterogeneous
regions if one deﬁnes dynamic heterogeneity through particle displacements [3].

3. Relaxation functions and their characteristic times

We begin by examining correlation functions related to particle displacements, bond-
orientational relaxation, and the lifetime of bonds between neighboring particles. First,

τint (green diamonds), the bond-orientational relaxation time τΨ (solid red triangles),
and the bond-breaking relaxation time τB (blue squares) as a function of temperature

the τΨ equals τB at T = 0.8. The open green diamonds is the integrated relaxation
time scaled so that equal τint equals τB at T = 0.8.

Therefore Zn(t = 0) is zero and Zn(t = ∞) is the number of bonds particle n had at
t = 0. The bond-breaking correlation function is deﬁned as

Shown in Fig. 1 are Fs(t) (solid black lines), CΨ(t) (dashed red lines), and CB(t)
(thick blue lines) as a function of time for T = 1.0, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.45 listed from
left to right. As noted in previous work [3], there is no plateau in the self-intermediate
scattering function if the simulated system is large enough, which is in contrast to
simulations of three-dimensional glass forming systems. However, a plateau does begin
to emerge in the bond-orientational correlation function CΨ(t). Furthermore, it can be
seen in Fig. 1 that the decay time of CΨ(t) increases faster with decreasing temperature
than Fs(k; t). The characteristic decay time of CB(t) is longer then that of either Fs(k; t)
or CΨ(t) at each temperature. While the particles are moving translationally and even
the orientations of the bonds between neighboring particles relax, the particles have not
lost their neighbors.

To quantify the decay time we deﬁne the relaxation times τα, τΨ, and τB through
Fs(k; τα) = e−1, CΨ(τΨ) = e−1, and CB(τB) = e−1. These relaxation times are shown in

Fig. 2 as a function of temperature. The relaxation time τα grows the slowest with
decreasing temperature. The bond-breaking relaxation times τB is larger than the
other two relaxation times over this temperature range. However, τΨ grows faster with
decreasing temperature than either τα or τB. To demonstrate this faster growth, we
show as open red triangles aτΨ where a is the ratio τB/τΨ at T = 0.8.

relaxation time τint = (cid:82) ∞

We note that we deﬁned τα in the standard way, but this deﬁnition is not the only
way to determine a relaxation time. Another method would be to examine an integrated
0 Fs(k; t)dt, which would be equal to τα as deﬁned above if
Fs(k; t) decayed exponentially and proportional to τα if time-temperature superposition
holds. However, time-temperature superposition does not hold for Fs(k; t) for the
two-dimensional glass former, so we also examined τint, which is shown as ﬁlled green
diamonds in Fig. 2.

We ﬁnd that τint grows with decreasing temperature at the same rate as τB, which
we demonstrate by multiplying τint by a constant b such that bτint is equal to τB at
T = 0.8, and this scaling is shown as the open green triangles in Fig. 2.

We note that time-temperature superposition holds very well for CB(t), and it also
holds for the ﬁnal decay of CΨ(t), i.e. for CΨ(t) ≤ 0.2, see Fig. 3. We checked whether
our results for the temperature dependence of the bond orientational relaxation time
depend on our deﬁnition of τΨ. If we deﬁne a relaxation time τ c
Ψ) = c
Ψ with c ≤ e−1
with c ≤ e−1, the choice of c does not alter our conclusions. Speciﬁcally, τ c
increases faster with decreasing temperature than τα, τint, and τB.

Ψ through CΨ(τ c

Finally, a visual inspection of the bond-breaking and bond-orientational correlation
functions suggests that the bond-breaking relaxation is less stretched that the bond-
orientational one. To quantify the temperature dependence of the shape of these
correlation functions we ﬁt CB(t) and CΨ(t) to a stretched exponential A exp(−(t/τ )β).
We found that the the stretching exponent β was independent of temperature for CB(t),
and was 0.673 ± 0.004. The stretching exponent for CΨ(t) was β = 0.651 ± 0.006 at
T = 1.0 and β ≈ 0.62 ± 0.01 for 0.45 ≤ T ≤ 0.8.

4. Dynamic Correlation Lengths

It has been suggested that the characteristic size of clusters of correlated relaxation
events can deﬁne a dynamic correlation length that accompanies the glass transition.
Here we examine correlations between bond-breaking events and correlations of bond-
orientational relaxation. To ﬁnd the dynamic correlation length it has become standard
practice to deﬁne a four-point structure factor

associated with particle n. Thus, the weight function determines the dynamic events
whose spatial correlations the four-point structure factor measures.

In previous work we examined the characteristic size of clusters of slow particles
[3]. To this end we used a weight function that selects slow particles, which we deﬁned
as particles that moved less than a = 0.22, Θ(a−|rn(t)− rn(0)|) where Θ is Heaviside’s
step function. We found that the characteristic size of clusters of particles which are
slow on the time scale of the α relaxation time, τα, grows linearly with τα for two-
dimensional systems evolving with Newtonian dynamics [3]. This was in contrast with
the ln(τα) growth that was observed for fragile glass formers in three dimensions [12, 16].
Here we examine correlations of bond-breaking events. To this end we use Zn(t) as the
weight function wn(t). We also study correlated bond-orientational relaxation by using
6 (0)]∗ as the weight function. To determine the dynamic correlation length
Ψn
ξw(t) we ﬁt Sw
4 (0; t)/[1 + (qξw(t))2], for small
q. We denote dynamic correlation lengths characterizing the spatial correlations of
bond-breaking events as ξB(t) and dynamic correlation lengths measuring the spatial
correlations of bond-orientational relaxation as ξΨ(t). For a comparison, we also present
the dynamic correlation lengths characterizing the size of clusters of slow particles, which
are denoted as ξO(t).

Figure 4. The time dependence of the bond-orientational correlation length ξΨ
(solid circles) and the bond-breaking correlation length ξB (open squares) for T =
1.0, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.5. Initially, the two correlation lengths are approximately equal,
but ξΨ stops growing at an earlier time than ξB. Both length scales have a period of
logarithmic growth (solid line) for T ≤ 0.7, before a peak and a decrease at later times.
The triangles is the time dependence of the overlap length calculated for T = 0.5.

We begin by examining the time-dependence of the correlation lengths ξB(t) and
ξΨ(t). Shown in Fig. 4 are the dynamics correlation lengths ξB(t) and ξΨ(t) as a function
of time for T = 1.0, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.45. For short times, ξB(t) (squares) and
ξΨ(t) (circles) are equal and grow approximately as ln(t) (solid line). We note that
the ln(t) growth of the correlation length is similar to what was reported for mobility
correlations in a three-dimensional hard sphere system [16], and is consistent with the
growth of mobility correlations for several fragile glass formers [12]. We found that the
growth of ξΨ(t) is arrested before that of ξB(t). Both ξΨ(t) and ξB(t) peak at their
speciﬁc characteristic times and then decrease for later times. We recall that in a three-
dimensional hard sphere system, there was a plateau in the overlap length and no peak
was observed [16], but a peak in the overlap length was reported in the three-dimensional
Kob-Andersen system [9]. While it is diﬃcult to determine the precise location of the
peak, ξΨ(t) peaks at a time approximately ﬁve times larger than τΨ and ξB(t) peaks at
a time that is about 2.5 times smaller than τB.

Shown as the triangles in Fig. 4 is the overlap length, i.e. the length characterizing
mobility correlations, ξO(t), for T = 0.5. At short times, it grows approximately linearly
with time. This initial linear growth of ξO(t) occurs for all temperatures (not shown
for clarity). Similar to the universal growth of ξΨ(t) and ξB(t), the time dependence of

ξO(t) is the same for each temperature at shorter times and there are deviations from
the master curve at later times. Importantly, Fig. 4 demonstrates the much stronger
growth of the overlap length than the lengths characterizing spatial correlations of bond-
breaking events and bond-orientational relaxation.

To compare the two lengths characterizing spatial correlations of bond-breaking
events and bond-orientational relaxation, we show the temperature dependence of their
maximum values in Fig. 5(a). Both lengths grow with decreasing temperature, but ξmax
(red circles) grows faster than ξmax
(blue squares). In Fig. 5(a) we show the ratio of
the two lengths, ξmax
is consistent with
ξmax

than τB. We note an approximate power-law relationship between the two lengths: a

ﬁt of ξmax
Fig. 5(c). However, a larger range of correlation lengths would be needed to conﬁrm
this relationship. In particular, it would be interesting to investigate what happens at
lower temperatures.

Typically, the ensemble dependent susceptibilities are studied and the behavior of the
full dynamic susceptibility Sw

We also show the time dependence of the correlation lengths ξB(t) (blue squares)
and ξΨ(t) (red squares) for T = 0.5 in Fig. 7. As noted in Sec. 4, ξB(t) and ξΨ(t) are
initially equal, but ξΨ(t) plateaus and decreases before ξB(t). Note that the maximum
length, denoted as ﬁlled squares, occurs slightly after the peak in χB(t) and χΨ(t) for
both correlation lengths. Recall that τB is larger than the time of the maximum of ξB(t)
and τΨ is smaller than the time of the maximum of ξΨ(t). Therefore, it seems appropriate
to compare the correlation lengths around the maximum of the susceptibility, which is
around the maximum lengths for ξB(t) and ξΨ(t). In fact, such a procedure was used in
Ref. [9].

6. Conclusions

We examined bond-orientational relaxation and bond-breaking events in a model two-
dimensional glass forming system. We found that the characteristic time for particles to
lose their neighbors, the bond-breaking relaxation time, is longer than the decay time of

bond-orientational correlations and the decay time of the self-intermediate scattering
function. However, the bond-orientational correlation time increases faster with
decreasing temperature than the bond-breaking relaxation time over the temperature
range studied.

We also examined the spatial correlations of bond-orientational relaxation and
bond-breaking events. We found that at each temperature the characteristic size of
correlated domains of bond-orientational relaxation and bond-breaking events were
equal at short times, but the characteristic size of domains of correlated bond-
orientational relaxation saturates at an earlier time than for bond-breaking events
and the associated maximum correlation length is smaller. However, the maximum
correlation length for bond-orientational relaxation grows faster with decreasing
temperature than the maximum correlation length for bond-breaking events. The
Ψ )γ with
correlation lengths appear to be related by a power law where ξmax
γ ≈ 0.54, but a larger range of length scales would needed to verify this relationship.
While we did not verify that the correlations of bond-orientational relaxation grow
as mobility correlations in three dimensions, this result would be expected since bond-
orientational relaxation time grows as structural relaxation time in three dimensions.
It has already been demonstrated that bond-breaking correlation length grows as
mobility correlation length in three-dimensions, but bond-breaking correlation length
grows slower than mobility correlation length in two dimensions [9]. However,
in
two dimensions there are now three time dependent correlation lengths with diﬀerent
temperature dependence. We note that the bond-orientational and the bond-breaking
correlation lengths appear to be related, and future studies of lower temperature two-
dimensional systems needs to be performed to understand this relationship fuller.

B ∝ (ξmax

We found that the ensemble dependent susceptibility calculated in an NVT
ensemble and the ensemble independent susceptibility each has a peak at a time slightly
less than the time of the maximum of the bond-orientational and the bond-breaking
correlation lengths. Importantly, the ensemble independent and the ensemble dependent
susceptibilities peak at the same time. Note that the peak time of the bond-orientational
dynamic susceptibility is larger than the bond-orientational relaxation time, but the
peak time of the bond-breaking dynamic susceptibility is at a time smaller than the
bond-breaking relaxation time. Therefore, the dynamic correlation length calculated
at the bond-orientational relaxation time is still growing, but the dynamic correlation
length calculated at the bond-breaking relaxation time has already reached its peak and
is decreasing.

q ≈ 0.3 and q ≈ 0.04 several wave-vectors with the same magnitude but are calculated

Appendix A. Calculating Dynamic Correlation Lengths

In this appendix we outline the procedure we use to obtain dynamic correlation lengths
in our study. We found that it was diﬃcult to determine how to ﬁt the small wave-vector
behavior of Sw
4 (q; t) from the four-point structure factor alone at times later than the
peak of the dynamic susceptibility due to noise for small wave-vectors.

Shown in Fig. A1 is SB

4 (q; t) at T=0.5 for several times. For short times, the small
q values converge and the Ornstein-Zernicke function provided good ﬁts to SB
4 (q; t).
Several ﬁts are shown in the ﬁgure. At later times, there is signiﬁcant noise in the
small q values of SB
4 (q; t) and ﬁts over diﬀerent ranges of q resulted in a large range of
correlation lengths. To determine the correct correlation length, we also calculated the
four-point pair correlation function
