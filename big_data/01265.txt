ABSTRACT
We present sub-arcsecond 7.5−13 µm imaging- and spectro-polarimetric observations
of NGC 1068 using CanariCam on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio CANARIAS. At all
wavelengths, we ﬁnd: (1) A 90 × 60 pc extended polarized feature in the northern
ionization cone, with a uniform ∼44◦ polarization angle. Its polarization arises from
dust and gas emission in the ionization cone, heated by the active nucleus and jet, and
further extinguished by aligned dust grains in the host galaxy. The polarization spec-
trum of the jet-molecular cloud interaction at ∼24 pc from the core is highly polarized,
and does not show a silicate feature, suggesting that the dust grains are diﬀerent from
those in the interstellar medium. (2) A southern polarized feature at ∼9.6 pc from the
core. Its polarization arises from a dust emission component extinguished by a large
concentration of dust in the galaxy disc. We cannot distinguish between dust emission
from magnetically aligned dust grains directly heated by the jet close to the core, and
aligned dust grains in the dusty obscuring material surrounding the central engine.
Silicate-like grains reproduce the polarized dust emission in this feature, suggesting
diﬀerent dust compositions in both ionization cones. (3) An upper limit of polarization
degree of 0.3 per cent in the core. Based on our polarization model, the expected po-
larization of the obscuring dusty material is (cid:46)0.1 per cent in the 8−13 µm wavelength
range. This low polarization may be arising from the passage of radiation through
aligned dust grains in the shielded edges of the clumps.

1 INTRODUCTION

NGC 1068 is the archetypal type 2 active galactic nucleus
(AGN), whose proximity (D = 12.5 Mpc, and 1 arcsec =

60 pc, adopting H0 = 73 km s−1 Mpc−1) and high bright-
ness make it an ideal target for polarimetry. This object is
probably the best-studied AGN regarding polarimetry, and
this has allowed us to obtain a better understanding of the
AGN structure. The most important polarimetric study of
NGC 1068, for the sake of the entire ﬁeld, was certainly
the detection of polarized broad emission lines in the optical
(0.35−0.70 µm) wavelengths by Antonucci & Miller (1985).
This detection is interpreted through scattering of the ra-
diation from the central engine (black hole and accretion
disc) into our line of sight (LOS) by matter in the ionization
cones. This result allowed us to understand that the cen-
tral engine of NGC 1068 is obscured by a dusty structure,
giving a major boost to the uniﬁed model of AGN. The
uniﬁed model (i.e. Lawrence 1991; Antonucci 1993; Urry &
Padovani 1995) of AGN posits that the observational dif-
ferences between AGN arise from the diﬀerent orientations
they present us. In this scheme, the AGN classiﬁcation solely
depends on the anisotropic obscuration of the central engine
by the optically and geometrically thick distribution of dust.
Pioneering infrared (IR) polarimetric observations
(Knacke & Capps 1974; Lebofsky et al. 1978) found that
the nucleus of NGC 1068 was highly obscured and polar-
ized. The observed degree of polarization rises from 1.6 ±
0.4 per cent at 1.25 µm to 2.7 ± 0.2 per cent at 3.45 µm, and
the position angle (P.A.) of polarization rotates from 99◦ ±
7◦ at 1.25 µm to 125◦ ± 2◦ at 3.45 µm in a 6 arcsec (360 pc)
diameter aperture. They suggested that the IR polarization
arises from an obscured power-law source, which is not di-
rectly observable at wavelengths shorter than 1 µm. Using
8−13 µm observations a the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Tele-
scope (AAT), Aitken et al. (1984) found a polarization spec-
trum with a uniform degree, 1.39 ± 0.09 per cent, and a P.A.
of 54.8◦ ± 1.9◦ within apertures of 4.2 arcsec (252 pc) and
5.2 arcsec (312 pc) diameter. Although they were not able
to rule out non-thermal processes, they suggested that dust
emission from non-silicate and featureless grains is respon-
sible for the mid-IR (MIR) polarization. Using these data
and additional 0.36−4.8 µm broad-band imaging polarimet-
ric observations, Bailey et al. (1988) concluded that the most
likely polarization mechanism at near-IR (NIR) arises from
the passage of centrally produced radiation through aligned
dust grains in the obscuring dusty structure; a mechanism
known as dichroic absorption. This result was further sup-
ported by the ﬂip in the P.A. of polarization of ∼70◦ from
NIR to MIR. They interpreted this result as the change from
dichroic absorption to dichroic emission from aligned dust
grains in the dusty structure obscuring the central engine.
At shorter wavelengths, a wavelength-independent intrinsic
(after correction for starlight dilution) polarization of ∼16
per cent with a constant P.A. of ∼97◦ from the ultravio-
let (UV, Antonucci et al. 1994) to optical wavelengths (An-
tonucci & Miller 1985) was found. The fact that the P.A. of
polarization at UV and optical is diﬀerent to that in the NIR,
suggests that diﬀerent mechanisms of polarization dominate
in these wavelength regimes. Further modeling (Young et al.
1995; Watanabe et al. 2003) and observations (Capetti et al.
1995; Packham et al. 1997; Lumsden et al. 1999; Simp-
son et al. 2002; Lopez-Rodriguez et al. 2015) have shown
that electron scattering is the dominant polarization mech-
anism from UV to optical, whilst dust distributed within
the 2−3 arcsec (120−180 pc) central region accounts for the

polarization features in the IR (Bailey et al. 1988). Specif-
ically, dichroic absorption from aligned dust grains within
the dusty circum-nuclear obscurer in NGC 1068 is the dom-
inant polarization mechanism in the 1−5 µm wavelength
range. Based on these studies, and together with the lack
of evidence of variations in the P.A. of polarization over a
period of months or years, non-thermal polarization mech-
anisms (e.g. synchrotron emission from a jet) can be ruled
out as a polarization mechanism in the core of NGC 1068.

At

large scales,

imaging polarimetric observations
(Scarrott et al. 1991) at the V band using the 3.9-m AAT
showed that the optical polarization follows the arm and
inter-arm structures of the galaxy. The degree of polariza-
tion increases in the large-scale inner bar (32 arcsec, 1.92
kpc) at a P.A. of 48◦, the so-called NIR bar (Scoville et al.
1988; Schinnerer et al. 2000; Emsellem et al. 2006). Further
high-spatial resolution optical (0.5−0.6 µm) polarimetric ob-
servations (Capetti et al. 1995) using the Hubble Space Tele-
scope (HST ) showed a centro-symmetric polarization pat-
tern along the ionization cones in the ∼10 arcsec (600 pc)
central region. This polarization pattern is the signature of a
central point source whose radiation is ultimately polarized
through scattering by dust and/or electrons (and which can
be polarized from multiple scattering into the funnel of the
obscuring dusty structure and/or broad line clouds). At UV
and optical wavelengths, these studies showed that electron
scattering is the dominant polarization mechanism in the
ionization cones of NGC 1068, with the optical polarization
in the oﬀ-nuclear regions following the magnetic ﬁeld of the
NIR bar.

Using high-spatial resolution imaging polarimetric ob-
servations at 9.7 µm on the 8.1-m Gemini telescope, Pack-
ham et al. (2007) found complex polarization structures
within the 2 × 2 arcsec (120 pc × 120 pc) central region of
NGC 1068. Speciﬁcally, (1) polarization arising from aligned
dust grains in the narrow line emission regions North of the
core, (2) dust being channelled toward the central engine
South, East and West of the core, and (3) a nuclear low, <0.6
per cent, polarization interpreted as the polarization aris-
ing from the compact (≤22 pc) obscuring dusty structure.
Although only one ﬁlter was used in this study, making it
diﬃcult to disentangle the several polarization mechanisms,
it showed the potential of MIR polarimetric observations to
study the structure within and around AGN.

In this paper we examine the interaction of the AGN
with the surrounding dusty structures within the central 2
arcsec (120 pc) region of NGC 1068. We also put constraints
on the polarization of the obscuring dusty structure. We
performed sub-arcsecond resolution 8−13 µm imaging- and
spectro-polarimetric observations using CanariCam on the
10.4-m Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) at the Roque
de los Muchachos Observatory. The paper is organized as
follows: Section 2 describes the observations and data re-
duction, Section 3 presents our polarimetric results. Polar-
ization models are developed in Section 4 to explain the sev-
eral polarization features, and then analyzed and discussed
in Section 5. In Section 6 we present the conclusions.

2.1 Imaging-polarimetry

NGC 1068 was observed on December 29 and 30, 2012, us-
ing the imaging polarimetric mode (Packham et al. 2005)
of CanariCam (Telesco et al. 2003) on the 10.4-m GTC in
Spain. CanariCam uses a 320 × 240 pixel Si:As Raytheon
array, with a pixel scale of 0.0798 arcsec pixel−1. The imag-
ing polarimetric mode uses a half-wave retarder (half-wave
plate, HWP), a ﬁeld mask and a Wollaston prism. The Wol-
laston prism and HWP are made with sulphur-free CdSe.
The HWP is chromatic, resulting in a variable polarimetric
eﬃciency across the 7.5−13 µm wavelength range that has
been well determined (Packham et al. 2008). This mode is
usable across the entire wavelength range. In standard po-
larimetric observations, the HWP is set in four P.A. in the
following sequence: 0◦, 45◦, 22.5◦and 67.5◦. The ﬁeld mask
consisted of a series of slots of 320 pixels × 25 pixels each,
corresponding to a ﬁeld of view (FOV) of 25.6 arcsec × 2.0
arcsec, where a total of three slots can be used, providing a
non-contiguous total FOV of 25.6 arcsec × 6.0 arcsec.

The Si2 (λc = 8.7 µm, ∆λ = 1.1 µm, 50 per cent cut-
on/oﬀ), Si4 (λc = 10.3 µm, ∆λ = 0.9 µm, 50 per cent cut-
on/oﬀ) and Si5 (λc = 11.6 µm, ∆λ = 0.9 µm, 50 per cent
cut-on/oﬀ) ﬁlters provide the largest wavelength coverage
with the best combination of sensitivity and spatial reso-
lution for the ﬁlter set of CanariCam in the 10 µm atmo-
spheric window. We thus used this combination of ﬁlters.
Additionally, to study possible star formation regions in and
around the core of NGC 1068, we performed observations
using the PAH2 (λc = 11.3 µm, ∆λ = 0.6 µm, 50 per cent
cut-on/oﬀ) ﬁlter. Observations were made using a standard
chop-nod technique to remove time-variable sky background
and telescope thermal emission, and to reduce the eﬀect of
1/f noise from the array/electronics. In all observations, the
chop-throw was 8 arcsec, the chop-angle was 0◦ E of N, and
the chop-frequency was 1.93 Hz. The angle of the short axis
of the array with respect to North on the sky (i.e. instrumen-
tal position angle, IPA) was 90◦ E of N, and the telescope
was nodded every 52s along the chopping direction. Thus,
only one slot with a FOV of 25.6 arcsec × 2.0 arcsec was used
in the observations, with the negative images (produced by
the chop-nod technique) within the same slot. For each ﬁlter,
two observational sets were observed, except for the PAH2
ﬁlter where three observational sets (one observational set
the ﬁrst night and two observational sets the second night)
were observed. A summary of the observations is shown in
Table 1. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the ob-
servations, the negative images on the array were also used,
providing the total useful on-source time shown in Table 1.
Data were reduced using custom idl routines. The dif-
ference for each chopped pair was calculated and the nod
frames, then diﬀerenced and combined to create a single
image per HWP P.A. During this process, all nods were
examined for high or variable background that could indi-
cate the presence of clouds or variable precipitable water
vapor. Fortunately, no data needed to be removed for these
reasons. As NGC 1068 was observed in diﬀerent sets, each
HWP P.A. frame was registered and shifted to a common
position, then images with the same HWP P.A. were co-
added. Next, the ordinary (o-ray) and extraordinary (e-ray)
rays, produced by a Wollaston prism, were extracted and

the Stokes parameters I, Q and U were estimated according
to the ratio method (e.g. Tinbergen 2005). Then, the degree
P =
were estimated.

The instrumental polarization was corrected based on
data provided by the GTC website1. Speciﬁcally, the instru-
mental polarization is Pins = 0.6 ± 0.2 per cent in all ﬁl-
ters with a dependence on the P.A. of polarization given by
P.A.ins = −(RMA +Elev)− 29.6◦, where RMA is the Nasmyth
rotator mechanical angle; and Elev is the telescope eleva-
tion. The instrumental polarization was corrected as follows.
The normalized Stokes parameters, qins = Qins/Iins and uins =
Uins/Iins, of the instrumental polarization were estimated
using the degree Pins and position angle P.A.ins of the in-
strumental polarization. Then, qins and uins were subtracted
from the normalized Stokes parameters of NGC 1068. Fi-
nally, the polarization eﬃciency was corrected based on data
provided by the GTC website2. Speciﬁcally, the polarization
eﬃciency is 90.3 per cent, 99.5 per cent, 95.9 per cent, and
97.0 per cent at 8.7, 10.3, 11.6, and 11.3 µm PAH, respec-
tively. The measurements of the degree of polarization were
corrected for polarization bias using the approach by Wardle
& Kronberg (1974).

The polarized young stellar object, AFGL 2403, was
observed at 8.7 µm and 11.3 µm immediately before
NGC 1068, with an on-source time of 73s in both ﬁlters.
In total ﬂux, AFGL 2403 was used as point-spread func-
tion (PSF) calibrator. Table 1 shows the full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of AFGL 2403, where a Moﬀat func-
tion with two parameters, FWHM and β , best described
the delivered PSF (e.g. Radomski et al. 2008). In polarime-
try, AFGL 2403 allowed us to characterize the polarization
observations because it is bright, 95.2 Jy, and polarized, 1.5
± 0.6 per cent and 1.2 ± 0.3 per cent at 8.7 µm and 11.3
µm, respectively. The degree of polarization of AFGL 2403
corrected for instrumental polarization and polarization ef-
ﬁciency at 8.7 µm, was estimated at 1.3 ± 0.2 per cent.
Our measurement is in excellent agreement with the degree
of polarization of 1.4 ± 0.8 per cent at 8.7 µm measured
by Smith et al. (2000, ﬁg. 2). The zero-angle of the P.A.

of polarization was calculated as the diﬀerence of the P.A.
of polarization from our measurement, θ = 100◦± 2◦, and
Smith et al. (2000), θs = 39◦± 4◦, i.e. ∆θ8.7µm = −61◦± 5◦ at
8.7 µm. At other wavelengths, the zero-angle was estimated
using the wavelength dependence of the P.A. of polarization
observed by Smith et al. (2000, ﬁg. 2).

Dedicated ﬂux-standard stars were not observed. Flux
calibration was performed using the N-band spectra ob-
served with Michelle on the 8.1-m Gemini North (Mason
et al. 2006). Speciﬁcally, ﬂux calibration was performed us-
ing the spectral points at 8.7, 10.3, 11.3, and 11.6 µm of the
0.4 arcsec wide slit oriented 20◦ E of N and centered at the
peak of NGC 1068 (see Mason et al. 2006, ﬁg. 2). The ex-
tracted ﬂuxes were 7.5, 8.3, 11.0, and 11.9 Jy, respectively.
Then, measured counts in a 0.4 × 0.4 arcsec simulated slit
aperture from our images at each wavelength were equated
to the ﬂux densities from the MIR spectra by Mason et al.
(2006). Finally, the factor Jy counts−1 was estimated and
used in the measurements of the ﬂux densities in the several
apertures shown in Section 3.1.1. These observations can be
found at GTC Public Archive.

2.2 Spectro-polarimetry

NGC 1068 was observed on July 22, 2013, during commis-
sioning of the spectro-polarimetric mode (Packham et al.
2005) of CanariCam on the 10.4-m GTC. The spectro-
polarimetric mode uses a HWP, a ﬁeld mask, a slit and a
Wollaston prism. A 0.41 arcsec (∼5 pixels) wide slit oriented
at 0◦ E of N to cover the North-South polarized features
of NGC 1068 was used. The low resolution N-band (λc =
10.4 µm, ∆λ = 5.2 µm, 50 per cent cut-on/oﬀ) grating was
used, resulting in a dispersion of 0.019 µm pixel−1 and R
= λ /∆λ ∼ 175.

Observations were made using a standard chop-nod
technique as described in Section 2.1 with a chop-throw of 8
arcsec, chop-angle of 90◦ E of N and a chop frequency of 1.93
Hz. The IPA was 0◦ E of N, and the telescope was nodded
every 45.5s along the chopping direction. Thus, only one slot
with a FOV of 25.6 arcsec × 2.0 arcsec was used in these ob-
servations. We took two spectro-polarimetric observational
sets with an on-source time of 947s each (Table 1). Before
these observations, we obtained acquisition N-band imaging
polarimetric observations with an on-source time of 79s. The
slit was aligned to the peak of the total ﬂux of NGC 1068
to better than 2 pixels (0.16 arcsec).

Data were reduced as described in Section 2.1. For each
spectro-polarimetric observational set of NGC 1068, the o-
and e-rays were extracted in two diﬀerent locations (Section
3.2) of the slit: (1) PSF-extraction of the Southern feature,
and (2) at 0.35 arcsec (4.4 pixels) North of the peak of the
total ﬂux density image using a ﬁxed 0.4 arcsec (5 pixels)
aperture. CanariCam shows a slight (∼1 pixel) curvature
across the array in the spectral direction, which was mea-
sured using the observations of the polarized young stellar
object, AFGL 2591. This curvature was taken into account
during the extraction of the spectra. For each observational
set, Stokes parameters, I, Q and U, were estimated according
to the ratio method, and then co-added to obtain the ﬁnal
spectra. Finally, the degree and P.A. of polarization were
estimated.

The instrumental polarization was corrected as de-

scribed in Section 2.1. The polarization eﬃciency was cor-
rected using observations of the unpolarized standard star,
HD 186791, through a wire-grid in the optical path of Ca-
nariCam. These observations allow us to estimate the po-
larization eﬃciency spectra of the HWP across the 7.5−13
µm wavelength range. The polarization eﬃciency was cor-
rected by multiplying the spectrum of the degree of polar-
ization of NGC 1068 by the inverse of the polarization eﬃ-
ciency spectrum. Although the variation of the polarization
eﬃciency was accounted for, a variable S/N of the Stokes pa-
rameters as a function of the wavelength still remains. We
corrected this eﬀect by binning the Q and U spectra across
the wavelength axis in bins of 0.285 µm (15 pixels) to obtain
higher S/N across the spectrum. The measurements of the
degree of polarization were corrected for polarization bias
using the approach by Wardle & Kronberg (1974).

The polarized young stellar object, AFGL 2591, was
observed using the spectro-polarimetric mode immediately
before NGC 1068. In total ﬂux, AFGL 2591 was used as
a PSF calibrator, giving us the FWHM across the wave-
length range for the PSF-extracted spectra. A Moﬀat func-
tion with two parameters, FWHM and β , best described the
delivered PSF. In polarimetry, AFGL 2591 allowed us to
estimate the zero-angle calibration of the observations be-
cause it is bright, 281.5 Jy, and highly polarized, 5.6 ± 1 per
cent (Smith et al. 2000, ﬁg. 2). The zero-angle calibration,
∆θ , was estimated as the diﬀerence of the measured P.A.
of polarization of our observations, θ = 58.5◦ ± 0.3◦, and
the P.A. of polarization by Smith et al. (2000), θs = 170◦ ±
1◦. We measured a constant P.A. of polarization across the
7.5−13 µm wavelength range, in excellent agreement with
Smith et al. (2000). Thus, the zero-angle of polarization was
estimated to be ∆θ = θs − θ = 111.5◦ ± 1.0◦.
The total ﬂux spectrum of NGC 1068 was wavelength-
calibrated to an accuracy of 0.019 µm pixel−1 using 10
µm window sky lines present in the spectrum. Then, the
total ﬂux spectrum was binned to a spectral resolution of
0.076 µm (4 pixels) to improve the S/N. Next, the spectrum
of NGC 1068 was divided by the spectrum of the standard
star, HD 186791 (K3III). Cohen & Davies (1995) show that
late K and M stars have fundamental vibration-vibration
bands of SiO in their spectra, which signiﬁcantly depress the
spectrum in the 7.5−10 µm wavelength range, and therefore
aﬀect the ratio with the science object. To remove this band
and obtain the original spectrum of NGC 1068, the total
ﬂux spectrum of NGC 1068 was multiplied by the template
spectrum of the standard star HD 186791, provided by the
Gemini website3. Flux calibration was achieved by using the
N-band spectra of NGC 1068 (in Jy) observed with Michelle
on the 8.1-m Gemini North (Mason et al. 2006). The mea-
sured nuclear spectrum (in counts) in a 0.4 arcsec aperture
was extracted and equated to the ﬂux density from the MIR
spectrum by Mason et al. (2006). The factor Jy counts−1
was estimated and used in several extractions of the spectra
from our observations.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Imaging-polarimetry

3.1.1 Photometry

Fig. 1 shows the total ﬂux images at 8.7, 10.3, 11.6, and
11.3 µm (PAH). At all wavelengths NGC 1068 appears as an
unresolved core in the E–W direction, with extended emis-
sion along N–S. The N–S extended emission slightly bends
to the N–W direction up to 0.5 arcsec (30 pc), and then to
the N–E direction up to 1.4 arcsec (84 pc); this feature was
termed as ‘tongue’ (see Bock et al. 2000, ﬁg. 2). At 1.4 arcsec
N–E from the core, the NE knot is located. These structures
are in excellent agreement with previously published high-
spatial resolution MIR observations (e.g. Bock et al. 2000;
Tomono et al. 2001; Galliano et al. 2005; Poncelet et al.
2007).

We made measurements of the nuclear total ﬂux density
images centred at the peak of the total ﬂux density at several
diameter apertures (hereafter, aperture refers to diameter)
to compare with previously published values (Table 2). In
all cases, photometric errors were estimated by the variation
of the counts in subsets of the data. Our photometric mea-
surements are consistent with published ﬂux density mea-
surements. We also made photometric measurements of the
Southern feature and North knot (Section 3.1.2, Fig. 2 and
3) in a 0.4 arcsec (24 pc) aperture centered on the peaks of
polarized ﬂux, for all features, and at each wavelength (Fig.
2 and 3).

3.1.2 Polarimetry

Fig. 2 shows the polarized ﬂux images with the overlaid po-
larization vectors at 8.7, 10.3, 11.6 and 11.3 µm (PAH). In
these ﬁgures, the overlaid polarization vectors are propor-
tional in length to the degree of polarization, and their orien-
tation shows the P.A. of polarization. Only polarization vec-
tors with P/σ p ≥ 3 are shown. σ p is the uncertainty of the de-
gree of polarization per pixel, estimated as σ p =
where σ q and σ u are the uncertainties of the normalized
Stokes parameters (Wardle & Kronberg 1974). Fig. 3 shows
the contours of the degree and P.A. of polarization for those

(cid:112)σ q2 + σ u2,

(i) The most prominent feature is the uniform P.A. of
polarization with an extension of ∼1.5 arcsec × 1 arcsec
(90 pc × 60 pc) North of the peak of the total ﬂux density
(white crosses in Fig. 2). The P.A. of polarization is roughly
constant, ∼44◦, in an area of 1.4 arcsec × 0.8 arcsec (84
pc × 48 pc), with variations of ∼10◦ (Fig. 3, bottom). In
this region, we found a resolved polarized knot at ∼0.4 arcsec
(24 pc) North from the peak of the total ﬂux images, termed
‘North knot’. For the North knot, the degree of polarization
shows a steep increase from South to North, with a peak in
the degree of polarization, which then decreases smoothly
to the NW and SW directions (Fig. 3-up). The degree of
polarization decreases at longer wavelengths (Table 4, Fig.
4) with a constant P.A. of polarization across the wavelength
range.
(ii) The polarized ﬂux images (Fig. 2) show a peak slightly
shifted, ∼0.16 arcsec (9.6 pc), SE from the peak of the
total ﬂux images. The degree of polarization increases at
longer wavelengths with a P.A. of polarization increasing
from 12◦ ± 10◦ to 37◦ ± 5◦ at 8.7 µm and 11.6 µm, respec-
tively.
(iii) At ∼0.5 arcsec (30 pc) South from the peak of the
total ﬂux images, an extended polarized feature is found.
This structure is spatially coincident with the ‘SW Lobe’
observed in polarized ﬂux at 2.0 µm using HST/NICMOS by
Simpson et al. (2002) and in the K(cid:48) band using MMT/MMT-
Pol by Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (2015).

We made measurements of the nuclear polarization to
compare with the literature (Table 3). In all cases, polari-
metric errors were estimated by the variation of the counts
in subsets of the data. Our measured nuclear polarization
in a 2 arcsec (120 pc) aperture at all wavelengths is higher
than the degree of polarization of 1.30 ± 0.05 per cent in a 2
arcsec aperture in the N-band using the 3.9-m AAT (Lums-
den et al. 1999). These authors measured a P.A. of polariza-
tion of 49◦ ± 3◦, which is in marginal agreement with our
measurements within the uncertainties. We interpret these
results as (1) an increase in the measured degree of polar-
ization by an improvement in the spatial resolution, (2) the
mix of diﬀerent polarization structures within the aperture,
and (3) the use of a wide bandwidth within the 10 µm at-
mospheric window, which implies that their measurements
were more strongly aﬀected by the wavelength dependence
of the diﬀerent mechanisms of polarization. We note that
the P.A. of polarization by Lumsden et al. (1999) is in bet-
ter agreement with our measured P.A. of polarization in the
Northern ionization cones (Table 4). This result indicates
that their nuclear polarization measurement was dominated
by the polarization arising from the Northern ionization cone
(Section 5.1), as a larger amount of polarized ﬂux is com-
ing from the North regions within their 2 arcsec (120 pc)
aperture. Within the nuclear 1.7 × 1.2 arcsec (102 × 72 pc)
elliptical aperture, our measured degree of polarization of
2.2 ± 0.7 per cent at 8.7 µm is in excellent agreement with
the measured degree of polarization of 2.48 ± 0.57 per cent
at 9.7 µm using the 8.1-m Gemini (Packham et al. 2007).
We note a diﬀerence in the measured P.A. of polarization of
26.7◦ ± 15.3◦ at 9.7 µm by Packham et al. (2007), and our
measured 46◦ ± 9◦ and 53◦ ± 8◦ at 8.7 µm and 10.3 µm, re-

spectively. Both measurements are in marginal agreement
within the uncertainties, however we note that the P.A. of
polarization by Packham et al. (2007) is in better agreement
with our measurements of the southern polarized feature
(Table 4). This diﬀerence can be understood as the polari-
metric observations of Packham et al. (2007) were more sen-
sitive to the central ∼1 arcsec due to their low S/N. Our de-
gree and P.A. of polarization are calibrated to standard stars

for polarization measurements, but we note that the total
and polarized ﬂux morphologies of the Gemini/MICHELLE
polarimetric data by Packham et al. (2007) seem to be ro-
tated by 180◦ from our dataset. We conﬁrmed the Canari-
Cam orientation through comparing our morphology with
other total ﬂux measurements, including de-convolved im-
ages, and ﬁnd a high degree of spatial coincidence. We spec-
ulate that perhaps the world coordinate system (WCS) used

to indicate North in the Gemini/MICHELLE polarimetric
data by Packham et al. (2007) was incorrect, perhaps due
to an additional reﬂection or translation in the polarimetry
mode compared to direct imaging.

Based on the observed polarized features and their S/N,
we made polarimetric measurements of (1) the North knot
in a 0.4 arcsec aperture, and (2) the Southern feature at
0.16 arcsec (9.6 pc) to the peak of the total ﬂux density in a
0.4 arcsec (24 pc) aperture. The total ﬂux density, degree of
polarization, P.A. of polarization and polarized ﬂux density
for each feature and ﬁlter are shown in Table 4. Figure 4
shows the measurements (blue squares) for each feature, as
well as the used apertures (blue circles in the central panel).
We found an aperture dependence on the polarization in the
Northern ionization cone. Speciﬁcally, a constant degree, ∼5
per cent, and P.A., ∼ 44◦, of polarization is measured using
a 1.4 × 0.8 arcsec (84 × 48 pc) elliptical aperture with P.A.
= 45◦.

3.2 Spectro-polarimetry

Fig. 4 shows the total ﬂux density (black solid line), the de-
gree and P.A. of polarization and the polarized ﬂux density
(black ﬁlled-dots) for the PSF-extracted spectra of the 0.4
arcsec (24 pc) ﬁxed aperture spectra of the North knot (left),
and the Southern feature (right). The 0.41 arcsec (∼5 pixels)
slit (black solid vertical lines) is shown. The total ﬂux spec-
tra were binned to a 0.076 µm (4 pixels) resolution, whilst
a 0.285 µm (15 pixels) bin was used for the degree, P.A. of
polarization and polarized ﬂux. The uncertainties were esti-
mated as a variation of the counts within the binned data.

For the Southern feature, the total ﬂux spectrum shows
strong dust continuum emission with a broad silicate absorp-
tion feature. This spectrum is similar and consistent with the
0.4 × 0.4 arcsec (24 × 24 pc) slit aperture of the 0.4 arc-
sec SSW spectrum using the 8.1-m Gemini by Mason et al.
(2006). The degree of polarization slightly increases with
increasing wavelength. The P.A. of polarization slightly in-
creases from 12◦ ± 10◦ to 37◦ ± 5◦ across the 8−12 µm wave-
length range. The polarized ﬂux increases with wavelength.
For the North knot, the total ﬂux spectrum is similar to
and consistent with the 0.4 arcsec NNE spectrum of Mason
et al. (2006), also showing strong dust continuum emission
with a broad silicate absorption feature and narrow ﬁne-
structure lines. In this spectrum, a [Ar iii/Mg vii] blend at
8.99 µm, and a [S iv] ﬁne-structure at 10.51 µm are de-
tected. The degree of polarization decreases with increasing
wavelength and the P.A. of polarization is roughly uniform
through the spectrum. The polarized ﬂux increases with in-
creasing wavelength.
Aitken et al. (1984) measured a uniform degree,
1.29 ± 0.09 per cent, and P.A., 54.8◦ ± 1.9◦, of polarization
across the 8−13 µm wavelength range using a 4.2 arcsec
(252 pc) beam. We note that their measured P.A. of po-
larization is consistent with the P.A. of polarization of the
northern ionization cone measured in our observations. We
thus gather that the measurements of Aitken et al. (1984)
were dominated by the northern ionization cone within their
4.2 arcsec (252 pc) beam, as a larger amount of polarized
ﬂux is coming from the North regions within their beam.
This result makes it diﬃcult to obtain information about
the core of NGC 1068, and shows the potential of subarc-
second resolution polarimetric MIR observations to obtain
more sensitive observations with the aim to study the cores
of AGNs.

4 POLARIZATION MODEL

We aim to reproduce the observed polarization in the 7.5-
13 µm wavelength range of the several observed features
discussed in Section 3. Speciﬁcally, we wish to reproduce
the observed degree and position angle of polarization for
1) the northern and southern ionization cones, and 2) the
obscuring dusty structure.

4.1 Components of the polarization model

MIR spectro-polarimetric observations of 55 objects (e.g.
young stellar objects, star formation regions, and active
galactic nuclei) using 4-m class telescopes found that 90 per
cent of the objects can be explained by dichroism (Smith
et al. 2000). Dichroic extinction and emission can compete at
a given wavelength. Both mechanisms need to be disentan-
gled through a multi-wavelength study. Fortunately, some
dust grain features, such as silicates, are present in the MIR
wavelength range, and can be used to distinguish between
the two mechanisms. In the case of silicates, the absorptive
polarization shows a peak at ∼10 µm, while the emissive po-
larization is less structured. In general, if a rotation of the
polarization angle with wavelength is observed, then more
than one mechanism of polarization may be present. Unless
the several polarization mechanisms have intrinsically the

image (center) with overlaid polarization vectors at 11.6 µm as in Fig. 2 is shown. The blue circles in the central panel represent the
aperture used for the imaging-polarimetric measurements (Section 3.1.2), and the two vertical black solid lines demarcate the position
and width of the 0.41 arcsec (∼5 pixels) slit. The total ﬂux density (ﬁrst row) spectra (black solid line) and imaging (blue squares)
measurements are shown with a spectral bin of 0.076 µm (4 pixels). The dashed lines indicate the positions of the [Ar iii/Mg vii] blend
at 8.99 µm, [S iv] ﬁne-structure at 10.51 µm, and 11.3 µm PAH emission lines, whilst the yellow region shows the approximate extent of
the telluric O3 band. The degree (second row), P.A. (third row) of polarization and polarized ﬂux density (fourth row) of the imaging-
(blue squares) and spectro-polarimetric (black circles) observations are shown. The spectro-polarimetric observations have a spectral bin

same polarization angle, the net polarization angle will be
a function of wavelength. Both the degree and angle of po-
larization proﬁles are crucial to investigate the emissive and
absorptive polarization components at MIR wavelengths.

The dichroic components can be disentangled following
the procedure put forward by Aitken et al. (2004). These
authors presented a procedure to separate and identify the
absorptive, pa, and emissive, pe, polarization components
within the 7.5−13 µm wavelength range. The emissive po-
larization component is given by pe = |pa/τλ|, where τλ is
the wavelength-dependent extinction curve. This condition
can be used as long as the diﬀerence in orthogonal optical
depths of the dust grains is less than unity for pa, which
makes pa independent of the optical depth. This situation
will hold if τMIR < a few tens. For the extinction curve, the
standard silicate-graphite interstellar dust grain of Rv = 5.5

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2015)

is assumed4, which appears to be in agreement with the MIR
extinction at diﬀerent sightlines through the Galactic center
(Weingartner & Draine 2001). Variations in our model of less
than 2% are found when extinction curves of Rv = 2.1, and
3.1 were used. For the absorptive component, pa, we took
the Becklin-Neugebauer (BN) object in Orion (Aitken et al.
1989) because it is the best-deﬁned absorptive component
with the highest S/N, and commonly used in these studies
(Smith et al. 2000).

The polarization model to separate the absorptive and
emissive polarization components is constructed as follows.

4 Note that recent studies (Gao, Li & Jiang 2013) suggested that
a trimodal grain size distribution with a combination of Rv = 2.1,
3.1 and 5.5 is required to achieve a good ﬁt to the extinction curve
of the Galactic center from the UV to the MIR.

Lopez-Rodriguez et al.

It assumes an emission source that can be either polarized
or unpolarized, and which is viewed through a cold dichroic
sheet of dust grains. The Stokes parameters from both com-
ponents simply add up, and the observed Stokes parameters,
qobs and uobs, can be ﬁtted as a linear combination of both
components:

qobs = qa + qe = Apa + Bpe

uobs = ua + ue = Cpa + Dpe

(1)

where A, B, C and D are the constants used for the ﬁt-
ting procedure. We followed the ﬁtting procedure described
by Aitken et al. (2004). Then, the ﬁnal degree of polariza-
obs, and the position angle, P.A.obs =
tion, Pobs =
0.5arctan (uobs/qobs), are estimated.

(cid:112)q2

obs + u2

The total ﬂux spectrum is deﬁned as an extinguished
blackbody component with a characteristic temperature
TBB. We have assumed an extinction curve with Rv = 5.5,
and the characteristic temperature was sampled in steps of
10 K. The polarized ﬂux was estimated as the modeled total
ﬂux, times the total degree of polarization, Pobs.

4.2 Fitting of the ionization cones

In the case of the northern ionization cone, a constant P.A.
of polarization (Table 4, Fig. 4-left) suggests a unique po-
larization mechanism. In objects in our Galaxy where MIR
polarization arises through dichroic absorption by aligned
dust grains, a prominent silicate peak in the degree of polar-
ization is present just longwards of 10 µm (i.e. Aitken et al.
1986; Smith et al. 2000). No such feature is present in the
polarization spectrum of the North knot in NGC 1068, which
instead shows a slow decrease in the degree of polarization
with increasing wavelength. Thus, non-silicate features, i.e.
non 9.7 µm feature, are present in the MIR polarization. We
give a further interpretation of these features in Section 5.1.
In the southern ionization cone, the rotation of the P.A.
of polarization (Table 4, Fig. 4-right) suggests that more
than one mechanism contributes to the polarization. Fol-
lowing the procedure described in Section 4.1, we simul-
taneously ﬁt the measured total ﬂux, degree and P.A. of
polarization of the Southern feature (Figure 5). The polar-
ization model has four free model parameters: 1) the visual
extinction Av towards the core, 2) the blackbody character-
istic temperature TBB, 3) the degree of polarization, and 4)
the P.A. of polarization. The ﬁt was considered acceptable
when the reduced χ2 was minimized. We obtain a reduced
χ2 = 0.21, 2.22, 15.8 and 14.2 for the ﬂux density, degree
and P.A. of polarization, and polarized ﬂux density, respec-
tively. Although we are aware of the limitations of the χ2
ﬁtting procedure, we are more interested on explaining the
overall behaviour of the polarization spectrum rather than
optimize the goodness of the ﬁtting, as we are limited by
the low S/N of the observations. Further development of a
Bayesian ﬁtting procedure is out of the scope of this paper,
but we think it will beneﬁt the statistical analysis presented
here as shown by Lopez-Rodriguez (2016). For the best ﬁt,
we found a blackbody component with a characteristic tem-
perature of TBB = 210± 10 K, extinguished with Av = 9 ± 1
mag. The emissive polarization component is dominant and
describes the observed wavelength dependence of the degree
of polarization with a P.A. = 35◦ ± 1◦. The absorptive com-
ponent contributes < 20 per cent of the polarization with a

total model (black solid line), and the absorptive (blue dotted
line) and emissive (red dashed line) polarization components from
our polarization model presented in Section 5.2.

P.A. = 127◦ ± 1◦. We give a further interpretation of this
feature in Section 5.2.

4.3 Fitting of the dusty central structure

We now investigate the expected MIR polarization of the ob-
scuring dusty structure in terms of dichroism. Dichroic ab-
sorption is the dominant mechanism of polarization at NIR
wavelengths in the core of NGC 1068. This allows us to con-
strain the absorptive and emissive polarization components
in the 2−13 µm wavelength range. For the absorptive com-
ponent, we assume a Serkowski (Serkowski et al. 1975) curve
up to 8 µm, followed by the absorptive proﬁle of the BN
object in Orion (Section 5.2.1) in the 8-13 µm wavelength
range. This composition takes into account the silicate fea-

MIR imaging- and spectro-polarimetry of NGC 1068

11

ture at MIR wavelengths, that, if not used, would lead to
the expected MIR polarization being underestimated by a
factor >100. Using NIR polarimetric adaptive optics obser-
vations, Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (2015) estimated an intrin-
sic (starlight-corrected) polarization at K(cid:48) of 7.0 ± 2.2 per
cent in a 0.5 arcsec (30 pc) aperture. Using this value to
constrain the absorptive polarization allows us to estimate
the intrinsic polarization of the obscuring dusty structure in
NGC 1068. To constrain the extinction curve (with Rv = 5.5
as in Sec. 5.2.1), lower and upper limits of the visual extinc-
tion towards the core of NGC 1068 must be assumed. For
the upper limit we used Av = 39 mag (Packham et al. 1997;
Watanabe et al. 2003; Lopez-Rodriguez et al. 2015), inter-
preted as the extinction to the NIR emitting regions. For
the lower limit, Av is estimated using the 9.7 µm silicate
feature, τ9.7µm ∼ 0.41, of the nuclear spectrum in a 0.4 × 0.4
arcsec (24× 24 pc) slit aperture by Mason et al. (2006). This
result was then converted5 to Av ∼ 8 mag. The diﬀerence of
both visual extinctions can be interpreted as a temperature
gradient and inhomogeneities (clumpiness) in the obscuring
dusty material (i.e. Pier & Krolik 1992; Imanishi & Ueno
2000; Levenson et al. 2007).

With the constraints on each component given above,
we estimated the absorptive and emissive intrinsic polar-
ization of the obscuring dusty structure of NGC 1068 in
the 2−13 µm wavelength range (Fig. 6). At wavelengths <4
µm, the absorptive component is dominant for all values
of Av. The emissive component is dominant for low values
of the visual extinction in the wavelength ranges of ∼4−8
µm and >11 µm, while both absorptive and emissive com-
ponents compete in the ∼8−10 µm wavelength range. Based
on this model, the expected polarization from extrapolating
the NIR absorptive component is (cid:46)0.1 per cent in the 8−13
µm wavelength range. We note that while there could be a
component of polarized emission from those dust grains, if
they are suﬃciently warm to emit in the MIR, the uncer-
tainties in estimating any contribution are very large. We
give a further interpretation of this feature in Section 5.3.

5 ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

We outline the general physical structure of the central 100
pc of NGC 1068, which will aid us in the analysis of the sev-
eral observed polarization features introduced in Section 3.
The polarized structures are discussed in the following order:
1) the northern ionization cone, 2) the southern ionization
cone, and 3) the obscuring dusty structure.

We present the structure of the inner 100 parsecs of
NGC 1068. It shows a complex geometry in the inner few
parsecs. Through 5 and 8.5 GHz radio observations using
the very long baseline array (VLBA), Gallimore et al. (2004)
detected the location of the hidden active nucleus (labeled
as S1 in their paper) as a parsec-sized (∼0.8 pc diameter)
structure with a major axis at P.A. ∼105◦. The emission of
this component most likely indicates strong free-free emis-
sion from hot (104−105 K) ionized gas. This structure is
oriented nearly perpendicular to the inner radio jet axis,

maser clouds indicate that the masers are located in a non-
Keplerian disk with inner radius ∼0.65 pc and outer radius
∼1.1 pc at a P.A. of −40◦ (Gallimore et al. 2001). Through
MIR interferometric observations, Jaﬀe et al. (2004) esti-
mated a warm (T = 320 K) dust structure with a 2.1 pc
thick and 3.4 pc diameter, surrounding a hot (T > 800 K)
compact (∼1 pc) structure. Additional MIR interferometric
observation by Raban et al. (2009) suggested a hot (∼800
K) 1.35 pc long and 0.45 pc thick structure with a larger 3
× 4 pc and warm (T ∼300 K) dust structure at a P.A. =
−42◦. These authors suggested that the dust and the maser
disk are co-spatial, where the dusty torus begins at the outer
edge of the maser disk. These results are consistent with the
established relationship between the water maser excitation
and warm (>600 K) molecular dust in AGNs (Neufeld et al.
1994). Where the maser disk ends and the dusty torus struc-
ture begins may be more a question of semantics rather than
a true physical boundary. Another implication from their re-
sults is that as the masers are seen edge-on, so is the torus,
consistent with the classiﬁcation of NGC 1068 as a Type 2
AGN. A sketch of the inner few parsecs of NGC 1068 is
shown in Figure 7-left. Note that this ﬁgure is a detailed
sketch of the central parsec of NGC 1068 adapted from ﬁg. 6
in Lawrence & Elvis (2010). Based on the geometry of the
inner few parsecs, misalignments between these structures
are found. Although misaligned structures on similar spatial
scales have been observed in other AGNs (i.e. Miyoshi et al.
1995; Wilson et al. 1995; Greenhill et al. 1997; Hagiwara
et al. 1997; Trotter et al. 1998), it is not the scope of this

paper to investigate these, and we refer to the reader to the
discussion in Lawrence & Elvis (2010).

At larger scales (>10 pc), NGC 1068 displays a variety
of structures. Most of the radiation emerges from the interac-
tion of the radio jet with material in the ionization cones par-
tially extinguished by the disk of the galaxy and/or the NIR
bar. The inner few parsecs of the ionization cone are roughly
aligned with the radio jet in the N-S direction. At ∼24 pc in
the northern ionization cone, the radio jet changes direction
when it interacts with the molecular cloud (i.e. North Knot)
(e.g. Gallimore et al. 2001). The radio-jet emission between
the central few parsecs and the molecular cloud is dominated
by synchrotron emission, while the jet-molecular cloud inter-
action radiates at all wavelengths. After this interaction, the
radio jet expands and is roughly aligned with the extended
northern ionization cone on a ∼50−100 pc scale. The radio
jet in the southern ionization cone does not change direction
and moves away from our LOS. The radio jet and molecular
cloud are extinguished by the NIR bar with an extension
of ∼1.92 kpc at a PA ∼48◦ (Scoville et al. 1988; Schinnerer
et al. 2000; Emsellem et al. 2006). Figure 7-right outlines
the large scale structures.

5.1 The northern ionization cone

We analyze here the polarization mechanism from the north-
ern extended polarization feature, and the North knot. As we
noted in the introduction, NGC 1068 has a NIR bar with an
extension of 32 arcsec (1.92 kpc) at a P.A. = 48◦ (Scoville
et al. 1988; Schinnerer et al. 2000; Emsellem et al. 2006). In
this region, the optical (Scarrott et al. 1991) and, J and H
(Packham et al. 1997) polarization shows a P.A. of polar-
ization consistent with the orientation of the NIR bar. This
result is most easily interpreted as polarization arising from
extinguished starlight passing through aligned dust grains
in the NIR bar. Dichroic absorption dominates the polar-
ization in the NIR bar, suggesting that the dust grains are
aligned by the galactic magnetic ﬁeld at P.A. = 48◦. The
measured P.A. of polarization of ∼44◦ in the northern ion-
ization cone is consistent with the measured P.A. of polariza-
tion in the optical, J, and H bands. This result suggests that
the dichroic absorption mechanism may dominate from the
optical to the MIR in the NIR bar at the northern ionization
cone.

To understand the polarization of the North knot and its
relation with the extended polarization feature, we further
compare the degree of polarization map at 8.7 µm, and maps
of the emission lines Paschen-α (Paα) at 1.875 µm (Fig. 8-
middle) and [O iii] at 0.5007 µm (Fig. 8-right). We obtained

archival images of NGC 1068 at Paα (ID: 7215, observed on
1998 Feb. 21) and [O iii] (ID: 5754, observed on 1995 Jan. 17)
emission lines using HST. We found that the MIR polariza-
tion is spatially coincident with the Paα (Fig. 8-middle) and
[O iii] (Fig. 8-right) emission lines. Paα line emission can be
interpreted as a tracer of young (<30 Myr) star formation
or gas emission. Storchi-Bergmann et al. (2012) found an
episode of young (30 Myr) stellar population in a ring-like
structure at ∼100 pc from the nucleus, coincident with the
ring of molecular gas detected in the 2.12 µm warm molec-
ular hydrogen line and in cold molecular gas detected by
ALMA (Garc´ıa-Burillo et al. 2014). We found that the mor-
phology of this young stellar population and cold molecular
gas resembles neither the Paα line emission nor the MIR
features in the northern ionization cone. Additionally, we
found no evidence of 11.3 µm PAH feature in the north-
ern ionization cone in our spectropolarimetric observations
(Fig. 4-left), consistent with MIR spectroscopic observations
by Mason et al. (2006). This comparison between Paα line
emission with the degree of polarization suggests that the
Paα line emission is tracing gas photoionized by the AGN
and/or gas excited by shocks in the ionization cones. This
result is further supported by the spatial correspondence of
Paα and [O iii] emission lines, as the latter is a good tracer of
the gas emission in the narrow line regions (e.g. Evans et al.
1991; Emsellem et al. 2006; Kraemer et al. 2015). Based
on these results, we interpret the MIR polarization of the
northern ionization cone as arising from extinguished radia-
tion from dust and gas heated by the AGN (e.g. Crenshaw &
Kraemer 2000; Kraemer & Crenshaw 2000a; Das et al. 2007)
and the interaction of the jet (e.g. Gallimore et al. 1996)
with dust and gas in the northern ionization cone passing
through the aligned dust grains in the NIR bar producing
the uniform P.A. of polarization in the northern ionization
cone. The fact that the P.A. of polarization is not perfectly
aligned along the P.A. of the NIR bar can be explained as
the radiation from the jet-molecular cloud interaction being
polarized with a slightly diﬀerent P.A. of polarization. Vari-
ations of the S/N in the northern regions can also explain
the ∼10◦ ﬂuctuations of the P.A. of polarization.

Based on the model presented in Section 4, the dust
grains in the northern ionization cone are diﬀerent from
those in the interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way.
This conﬁrms the spectropolarimetric observations of Aitken
et al. (1984), who also found a relatively featureless polar-
ization spectrum in a 4.2 arcsec (252 pc) beam. They con-
cluded that it was not produced by standard silicate grains.
The North knot region produces the bulk of the nuclear po-
larization in NGC 1068, and our observations conﬁrm that
it mostly arises from non-silicate grains, despite the clear
signature of silicate absorption in the total ﬂux density spec-
trum (Fig. 4, left).

We considered other polarization mechanisms to explain
the MIR polarimetric observations of the northern ioniza-
tion cone. Scattering oﬀ electrons and/or dust grains can
be ruled out due to the uniform P.A. of polarization in this
region; there is no evidence of a centro-symmetric pattern
that would be expected for scattering of radiation from a
nuclear source. We considered also the possibility of the jet-
molecular cloud interaction as a dust grain alignment mech-
anism in the northern ionization cone. For this study, we
obtained archival images of NGC 1068 at 8 GHz (Observer:

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2015)

AC467, observed on 1999 Sep. 08) using the Very Large
Telescope (VLA). We plot the degree of polarization map
at 8.7 µm and radio emission at 8 GHz in Figure 6, left. If
the jet-molecular cloud interaction dominated in the north-
ern ionization cone, we would expect the magnetic ﬁeld to
be parallel to the interface of the jet-molecular cloud inter-
action (e.g. Drury 1983). The magnetic ﬁeld is compressed
in the interface and increases in strength, resulting in better
dust grain alignment in the northern ionization cone than
in the ISM. As noted in Section 5, the jet bends at the po-
sition of the North knot, which would imply variations of
P.A. of polarization of ∼30◦ as a consequence of the diﬀer-
ent interface between jet and surrounding molecular dust in
the northern ionization cone. Despite the registration un-
certainties of ∼0.1-0.3 arcsec in Fig. 6-left, the uniform P.A.
extends further (∼1.5 × 1.0 arcsec, i.e. 90 × 60 pc) than
the radio jet emission. These observations suggest that the
jet-molecular cloud interaction cannot be the dominant po-
larization mechanism in the whole northern ionization cone.

5.2 The southern ionization cone

We present here an analysis of the southern ionization cone
and its Southern feature. The optical and NIR spectral lines
and continuum emission are much fainter to the South of the
core of NGC 1068 (Macchetto et al. 1994; Bruhweiler et al.
2001; Thompson et al. 2001, see also Fig. 6), with a deeper
silicate feature, τ9.7, within 1 arcsec SSW of the core (Mason
et al. 2006). To show these results, we produced (Fig. 9) a
NIR colormap of NGC 1068 using archival HST /NICMOS
images, speciﬁcally F110W and F160W (ID: 7215, observed
on 1998 Feb. 21). Next, we modeled the PSF at each ﬁl-
ter using TinyTim (Krist et al. 2011), and then the PSFs
were subtracted from the HST /NICMOS images. Finally,
the F110W / F160W colormap (Fig. 9) was produced. Fig.
9 shows larger amount of host galaxy dust to the South of
the core of NGC 1068, suggesting that the southern ioniza-
tion cone suﬀers from higher extinction than the northern
ionization cone. This result is in agreement with the increase
of the NIR polarization to the SW (Young et al. 1995; Pack-
ham et al. 1997; Simpson et al. 2002; Lopez-Rodriguez et al.
2015), interpreted as an additional scattering medium in this
region. In addition, the dusty disc of the galaxy has an in-
clination of 29◦ (Garc´ıa-G´omez, Athanassoula & Barber`a
2002), screening the southern but not the northern ioniza-
tion cone (e.g. Packham et al. 1997; Bock et al. 1998; Krae-
mer & Crenshaw 2000b). Thus, the southern ionization cone
is more extinguished than the northern one, as is also sug-
gested by the deeper silicate feature (Mason et al. 2006).

We found that the MIR polarization of the southern
ionization cone is spatially coincident with the Paα (Fig. 8-
middle) and [O iii] (Fig. 8-right) emission lines. The P.A. of
polarization (Fig. 3-bottom) is ∼30◦ along the Paα emission
(Fig. 8-middle), whereas a P.A. of polarization of ∼10◦ is
observed where not spatial coincident with this emission line
is found. For those regions where MIR polarization and Paα
emission are spatially coincident, we interpret the observed
polarization in the southern ionization cone as dust directly
heated by the jet; this dust emission passes through both
the NIR bar and the disc of the galaxy. For those regions
where MIR polarization and Paα emission are not spatially
coincident, the polarization arises from dichroic absorption

were responsible for the dust grain alignment, then a con-
stant P.A. of polarization would be expected. Such a uniform
polarization pattern is however not observed, and thus po-
larization arising from dust emission of aligned dust grains
by the radio jet can be ruled out.

5.2.1 The Southern feature

Based on the model presented in Section 4.2, we interpret the
polarization of the Southern feature as a polarized dust emis-
sion component passing through a large concentration of sil-
icates as well as the dusty disc of the galaxy along our LOS.
The polarized dust emission component in the Southern fea-
ture can arise from 1) magnetically aligned dust grains di-
rectly heated by the jet in the southern ionization cone close
to the AGN, or 2) aligned dust grains in the obscuring dusty
structure surrounding the central engine (Section 5.3). As
the core is included within the aperture used to perform
the measurements of the Southern feature, we cannot distin-
guish between dust grains in the southern ionization cone
and those grains associated with the circum-nuclear dusty
obscuring structure. Unfortunately, to obtain polarimetric
measurements in an aperture further south of the nucleus
to avoid the core of NGC 1068 produced low S/N spectra
making it diﬃcult to interpret the polarization.
As noted in Section 4, a prominent peak at wavelengths
∼10 µm would be present in the degree of polarization if
silicate grains were present. It is interesting that the po-
larization of the Southern feature can be reproduced with
silicate emission/absorption, while the North knot does not
show such silicate feature in the polarization spectrum. This
suggests diﬀerent dust composition within the central 120 pc
of NGC 1068. If the interaction of the jet with the dust in
the northern ionization cone is changing the dust proper-

in the galaxy. As the southern ionization cone is aﬀected
by several extinction components, its P.A. of polarization
diﬀers from that observed in the northern regions.

As in the northern regions, scattering oﬀ electrons
and/or dust grains can be ruled out, as there is no evidence
of the centro-symmetric pattern that would be expected for
scattering of radiation from a nuclear source. If the radio jet

ties, then the observed silicate feature of the Southern fea-
ture may favour the observed polarization arising from dust
grains in the obscuring dusty structure surrounding the cen-
tral engine of NGC 1068. We study the contribution of the
obscuring dusty structure in Section 5.3.

is expected (Fig. 6), which would be detectable in our ob-
servations. Thus, the model of emissive polarization arising
from aligned dust grains in the clumps is consistent with the
non-detection of MIR polarization at the core of NGC 1068.
Based on these results, Figure 10 shows the possible conﬁg-
uration for a clump compatible with the observations.

5.3 The obscuring dusty structure

Although the MIR total ﬂux density peaks at the position of
the AGN (i.e. Braatz et al. 1993; Cameron et al. 1993; Lums-
den et al. 1999; Bock et al. 1998; Alloin et al. 2000; Bock
et al. 2000; Tomono et al. 2001; Jaﬀe et al. 2004; Galliano
et al. 2005; Mason et al. 2006; Tomono et al. 2006; Raban
et al. 2009; L´opez-Gonzaga et al. 2014), a very low polariza-
tion with an upper-limit of 0.3 per cent at this location is
detected within the 8−13 µm wavelength range (Fig. 2 and
3). We present here an interpretation of the MIR polariza-
tion of the obscuring dusty structure of NGC 1068 in the
context of the Clumpy6 torus models (Nenkova et al. 2002,
2008a,b). Clumpy models the obscuring dusty structure as
an optically and geometrically thick torus surrounding the
central engine of an AGN, and comprised of dusty clouds.

Lopez-Rodriguez et al. (2015) interpreted the NIR po-
larization of NGC 1068 in terms of the level of magnetization
through the estimation of the thermal-to-magnetic pressure
ratio in the clumps. Speciﬁcally, the NIR polarization they
measured is determined in the outermost material of lower
optical depth in the clumps. Based on these results, and the
fact that the absorptive/emissive polarization components
should arise from the same aligned dust grains, but with
orthogonal polarization angles, we are able to give an in-
terpretation of the IR polarization. The NIR polarization
arises from the passage of NIR radiation from directly illu-
minated clumps through the low-density dusty regions of the
clumps with a visual extinction of ANIR
. The same aligned
dust grains emit at MIR wavelengths, and this radiation
passes through lower extinction, AMIR
, than the NIR pho-
tons. The lower the extinction, the higher the emissive in-
trinsic polarization component, i.e. Pem = Pabs/τ. Since our
observations do not show a MIR polarization at the core, and
from our polarization model, the minimum visual extinction
that the MIR radiation passes through is AMIR
v = 8 mag. For
lower AMIR

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2015)

Although the Clumpy models assume only discrete
dust clumps with no inter-clump medium, an inter-clump
medium should be considered as a more physical realis-
tic model. We here put constraints on the extinction of
the inter-clump medium to be used in two-phase clumpy
torus models. Assuming a magnetohydrodynamical frame-
work in the obscuring dusty structure of NGC 1068 (Lopez-
Rodriguez et al. 2015), a global magnetic ﬁeld at the same lo-
cation of the obscuring dusty material aligns the dust grains
in both the inter-clump medium and in the clumps. In this
scheme, the IR polarization can arise from the passage of
radiation through aligned dust grains in the clumps, as de-
scribed above, and/or in the the inter-clump medium. To
obtain an upper-limit on the extinction of the inter-clump
medium, we assume that the clumps are optically thick
with uniform density, then the aligned dust grains in the
inter-clump medium would be responsible for the observed
dichroic polarization at IR. Speciﬁcally, the IR radiation
from the clumps passes through the aligned dust grains in
the inter-clump medium. We now deﬁne the ratio of the op-
tical depth of the clump, τ c, and inter-clump medium, τ m,
with the contrast parameter C = τ c/τ m. C is a positive quan-
tity, with C = 1, describing the obscuring dusty material in
a smooth distribution of dust, where large values of C will
enhance the clumpy distribution of dust grains. An optical
v = 49+4−3 was took from Alonso-
depth of the clumps of τ c
Herrero et al. (2011) using Clumpy models to ﬁt the nuclear
IR spectral energy distribution (SED) of NGC 1068. Based
on our polarization model, the minimum visual extinction to
be compatible with the observations is Av = 8 mag, or τv =
8.7. Taking this value as the extinction of the inter-clump
medium, we obtain a contrast of C = 5.6+0.4−0.7 at V-band.
This result favors the clumpy distribution of dust versus
a smooth-density obscuring material. The clumpy models
(Stalevski et al. 2012; Siebenmorgen et al. 2015) including
a two-phase medium are crucial to generate SED based on
the MIR polarimetric observational constraints. However,
the development of these models is beyond the scope of this
paper.

6 CONCLUSIONS
We presented sub-arcsecond resolution MIR (7.5−13 µm)
imaging- and spectro-polarimetric observations of NGC 1068
obtained with CanariCam on the 10.4-m GTC. Using the
wide MIR wavelength coverage, we were able to disentan-
gle several polarized structures in the complex 3 × 2 arcsec
(180 × 120 pc) central region through their polarization sig-
natures. At all wavelengths, we found:

(i) Northern ionization cone: the most prominent feature
is the uniform P.A. of polarization, ∼44◦, with an extension
of ∼1.5 × 1.0 arcsec (90 × 60 pc). Based on our polariza-
tion model, we found that the polarization arises from dust
and gas emission in the ionization cone, heated by the AGN
and jet, and further extinguished by aligned dust grains in
the NIR bar. In this region, we found that the North knot,
located at ∼0.4 arcsec (24 pc) from the core, is spatially co-
incident with the interaction of the jet and molecular cloud.
The North knot shows a uniform P.A. of polarization and a
slow decrease in the degree of polarization with increasing
wavelength. No silicate feature is found in the polarization
spectrum of the North knot, suggesting that the dust grains
are diﬀerent from those in the ISM.
(ii) Southern ionization cone: we found a polarized fea-
ture at ∼0.16 arcsec (9.6 pc) South of the core. Based on our
polarization model, the Southern feature polarization arises
from an emissive polarization component passing though a
larger concentration of dust than in the northern ionization
cone. For this emissive component, we cannot distinguish be-
tween 1) magnetically aligned dust grains directly heated by
the jet in the southern ionization cone close to the AGN, and
2) magnetically aligned dust grains in the obscuring dusty
structure surrounding the central engine. The polarization
spectrum shows a prominent silicate feature, suggesting that
diﬀerent dust grains composition or sizes may be present in
the northern and southern ionization cones.

(iii) Obscuring dusty structure: An upper limit of 0.3 per
cent in the degree of polarization from the core is detected
in our observations. Based on our polarization model, the
expected polarization from extrapolating the NIR absorp-
tive component is (cid:46)0.1 per cent in the 8−13 µm wavelength
range. We note that while there could be a component of
polarized emission from those dust grains, if they are suﬃ-
ciently warm to emit in the MIR, the uncertainties in esti-
mating any contribution are very large. We suggested that
the MIR polarization arises from the passage of MIR radi-
ation through aligned dust grains in the shielded edges of
the clumps located at the innermost regions of the obscur-
ing dusty structure (Fig. 10). Alternatively, an obscuring
clumpy structure with an inter-clump medium, and with
an optical depth contrast between the clumps and the inter-
clump medium of C = 5.6+0.4−0.7 at V-band, can also reproduce
the upper-limit of the degree of polarization in our observa-
tions.

The sub-arcsecond resolution polarization observations
of NGC 1068 demonstrate that there are a number of dif-
ferent regions and mechanism operating within the central
10s of parsecs in this AGN. Similar complexity may occur
in other AGNs, where the current observations cannot re-
solve these structures. Further sub-arcsecond MIR imaging-
and spectro-polarimetric observations to several AGNs are

crucial to ﬁnd ordinary and/or extraordinary properties in
AGN allowing us to reﬁne and/or modify the AGN uniﬁed
model.
