ABSTRACT

Gravity plays important roles in the evolution of molecular clouds. We present an acceleration mapping method to
estimate the acceleration induced by gravitational interactions in molecular clouds based on observational data. We
ﬁnd that the geometry of a region has a signiﬁcant impact on the behavior of gravity. In the Pipe nebula which can be
approximated as a gas ﬁlament, we ﬁnd that gravitational acceleration can eﬀectively compress the end of this ﬁlament,
which may have triggered star formation. We identify this as the “gravitational focusing” eﬀect proposed by Burkert
& Hartman (2004). In the sheet-like IC348-B3 region, gravity can lead to collapse at its edge, while in the centrally
condensed NGC1333 cluster-forming region gravity can drive accretion towards the center. In general, gravitational
acceleration tends to be enhanced in the localized regions around the ends of the ﬁlaments and the edges of sheet-
like structures. Neglecting magnetic ﬁelds, these “gravitational focusing” and “edge collapse” eﬀects can promote the
formation of dense gas in a timescale that is much shorter than the global dynamical time. Since the interstellar medium
is in general structured, these edge eﬀects should be prevalent.

1. Introduction
Star formation takes place in the dense and shielded parts
of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM) (Dobbs et al.
2014), and it is probably determined by a combination of
turbulence (Mac Low & Klessen 2004; Hennebelle & Falgar-
one 2012), gravity (Heyer et al. 2009; Ballesteros-Paredes
et al. 2011, 2012), magnetic ﬁeld (Li et al. 2014) and ion-
ization radiation (Whitworth et al. 1994; Dale et al. 2009).
Gravity is one of the fundamental forces in nature, and
it plays a determining role in the formation of the stars.
However, observational understandings of its importance
are still limited. Various methods have been proposed to
quantify the importance of gravity on local (Bertoldi &
McKee 1992) and global (Li et al. 2015a) as well as var-
ious immediate scales (Rosolowsky et al. 2008; Goodman
et al. 2009). In most of these methods, the eﬀect gravity is
estimated from the bulk properties of the regions obtained
through averaging (e.g. the total mass and bulk velocity dis-
persion).
In contrast to these, we propose a new method
to study how gravity acts on individual structures.

It is expected that detailed morphologies of the gas are
tightly linked to the star formation activities. This can be il-
lustrated by the simulations of Burkert & Hartmann (2004);
Hartmann & Burkert (2007). In a simpliﬁed case, the col-

lapse of a roundish disk of a constant surface density un-
der the inﬂuence of self-gravity is simulated. Diﬀerent from
the common perception that the disk will merely shrink
in radius, the simulation shows that matter accumulates
at its edge. Such an accumulation of gas leads to subse-
quent formation of ﬁlaments at the edge and ﬁnally dense
cores. The collapse of ﬁlaments are also simulated (see also
Clarke & Whitworth 2015; Seifried & Walch 2015), and it is
found that matter accumulates at the ends of the ﬁlaments.
To understand these phenomena, one needs to understand
how gravity acts on gas in regions with diﬀerent geome-
tries. These information can not be obtained through e.g.
the virial parameter. A better method which can provide
estimates on the importance of gravity in regions with ar-
bitrary geometries is thus needed.

There have been growing interests in studying ﬁlamen-
tary structures in molecular clouds (André et al. 2010; Ar-
zoumanian et al. 2011; Peretto et al. 2012, 2014; Palmeirim
et al. 2013; Könyves et al. 2010; Schneider et al. 2012; An-
dré et al. 2014). Both numerical and analytical approaches
have been employed to understand the evolution of these
structures (Toalá et al. 2012; Tomisaka 1995) (Smith et al.
2014b; Seifried & Walch 2015; Clarke & Whitworth 2015)
(Heitsch & Hartmann 2014; Toci & Galli 2015; Inutsuka
& Miyama 1992; Wang et al. 2015). Filamentary structures
have also been identiﬁed at 102−103 pc scale (Li et al. 2013;
Ragan et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2014a; Goodman et al. 2014;
Wang et al. 2015). Due to their highly irregular morpholo-

gies, we expect gravity to behave in a non-uniform way in
these regions.

In this paper, we introduce an acceleration mapping
method to quantify the eﬀect of gravity on molecular ISM.
Our general aim is to provide intuitive and qualitative pic-
tures of the strength of gravitational acceleration in molec-
ular clouds. Section 2 we introduce the method. The eﬀect
of gravity in accelerating gas is discussed in Sec. 3. Then
we apply it to idealized examples as well as real observa-
tional data (Sections 4, 5). The importance of gravitational
acceleration in star formation is discussed in detail in Sec.
6. In Section 7 we conclude.

2. Calculating acceleration
2.1. General concept
Observationally, gas is observed on the sky plane, and the
distribution of gas along the line of sight is not easily ob-
served. To compute gravitational potential, we assume that
all the observed matter is distributed in a thin plate of
thickness H. We make this assumption mainly because of
observational limit, namely that matter can only be reliably
mapped on the sky plane in most observations. A general-
ization of the method to the 3D case is straightforward.

In our work, we ﬁrst compute gravitational potential
based on a column density distribution. Then we compute
gravitational acceleration distribution based on the gravi-
tational potential. Finally, we combined the gravitational
acceleration map with the column density map, and study
the eﬀect of gravity on matter. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.

ρ stands for density, φ stands for gravitational potential, and a
stands for acceleration.

2.2. Numerical realization
Observationally, matter can be observed on the sky plane
as Σ(x, y) where Σ is the surface density. In our study, we
compute gravitational acceleration based on Σ(x, y).

Assuming the observed gas is distributed on the 2D sky
plane with a thickness H, the projected gravitational po-
tential can be computed as (Gong & Ostriker 2011)

Φk,2D =

−2π G Σk,2D
|k|(1 + |kH|)

,

(1)

where Φk,2D is the projected gravitational potential in the
k space, and Σk,2D is the surface density in the k space.

Article number, page 2 of 19

Numerically, we ﬁrst make a Fourier transform to Σ(x, y)
and obtain Σk, then use Eq. 1 to evaluate Φk,2D. Finally,
Φ(x, y) is obtained through an inverse Fourier transform of
Φk,2D.

In reality, gravitational potential is a quantity deﬁned
in the 3D space. In this formalism, at one position on the
sky plane (x0, y0), the 2D projected gravitational poten-
tial Φ(x0, y0) is deﬁned as Φ(x0, y0) = Φ(x0, y0, z) where z
represent the direction of the line of sight and z = 0 .

With the gravitational potential, acceleration can be de-

numpy package.

The gradient is evaluated with np.gradient from the

The only parameter we need to introduce is the thick-
ness along the z direction H. In general, when H is small,
the structure of smaller scales are better represented, and
when H is large, small-scale structures tend to be smoothed
out in the acceleration map. Ideally, H should be chosen to
be close to the real 3D thickness of the cloud. However, this
is not feasible in practise. Here, we choose to use H = 0.3 pc
throughout this paper. This is because observations have
demonstrated that star formation tend to concentrate in
clumps, whose sizes are close to parsec scale (Beuther et al.
2002; Molinari et al. 2000). The size of the clumps provides
an hint to the expected thickness of the cloud. On the other
hand, we do not choose a H that is much larger than a
parsec, because we would still like to study the small-scale
structure of gravitational acceleration.

2.3. Boundary conditions
Computing gravitational potential and acceleration in the
Fourier space automatically assumes periodic boundary
condition. This means it is assumed that the input den-
sity distribution Σ(x, y) repeats itself in the x–y plane (
Σ(x, y) = Σ(x + x0, y) = Σ(x, y + y0) = Σ(x + x0, y + x0)
when the image have a size of (x0, y0)).

Since gravity is a long-range force, the presence of mat-
ter outside the box do have inﬂuences on the motion of gas
inside the box. Therefore, the results are dependent on the
boundary conditions which have to be speciﬁed.

In this work, for an input map of size (x0, y0) we added
zeros to the region where x < 0, x > x0, y < 0 or y >
y0, and created a map of the size (2 × x0, 2 × y0). Then
we use Eq. 1 to compute the gravitational potential. This
is equivalent to assuming that the cloud is surrounded by
a region devoid of matter. The size of the void region is
comparable to the cloud size. One can also increase the size
of this void region. Because gravitational force decays as
r−2, our results are not sensitive to this. However this will
increase the computational cost signiﬁcantly.

Nature is composed of a continuous distribution of mat-
ter, which are gravitationally interacting (e.g. molecular
clouds are in constant gravitational interaction with the spi-
ral arms). In computing our acceleration map, one has to
isolate the object of interest and study the gravitational ac-
celeration arising from the gravity originates for this object.
This isolation procedure can also lead to inaccuracies. How-
ever, one can always evaluate these eﬀects by comparing
the expected gravitational acceleration from a body that
is outside our box (|a| ≈ Gm/r2 where m is the mass of

Guang-Xing Li et al.: Gravitational acceleration mapping

the object outside our box, and r its the distance from our
object) with the acceleration computed in our map, to eval-
uate the eﬀect of the simpliﬁed boundary conditions on our
results.

2.4. Projection eﬀects
The acceleration map we obtain with this method is com-
puted at z = 0. In reality matter are not distributed in a
plane but are distributed in 3D. This will have an eﬀect
on our results. In general, acceleration maps are aﬀected
by projection eﬀects, and cautions should always be taken
when the region has a complicated structure or a multi-
ple of velocity components. Here we brieﬂy discuss various
projection eﬀects.

Because of line-of-sight contamination, physically unas-
sociated structures can appear as coherent. This will cer-
tainly have an impact on our results. However, in many
cases, the line-of-sight contamination can be accessed using
3D extinction (Sale et al. 2014) (Green et al. 2015; Chen
et al. 2014; Kainulainen et al. 2014) (Hanson & Bailer-Jones
2014; Berry & Ivezić 2011; Lallement et al. 2014) or velocity
information.

For clumpy structures, the fact that we can not distin-
guish structures along the line of sight only have a moderate
inﬂuence on the results. Consider a portion of a clump that
is separated from the center by a distance L. In our cal-
culations, it is automatically assumed that the all the gas
stays at z = 0. If a portion of the cloud with mass m stays
at z = z0 instead of z = 0, the acceleration it contributes
is a ∼ Gm/(L2 + z2
0). For a clump, because the geometry
is close to symmetric, z0 (cid:46) L, the error is relatively small,
and is generally acceptable.
For ﬁlamentary structures, inclination has a signiﬁcant
impact on the result. To illustrate this one can look at the
gravitational acceleration around a ﬁlament. Consider a ﬁl-
ament of length l0 and width d. The ﬁlament has a line
mass of δ = dm/dl. The gravitational acceleration at one
end of this ﬁlament can be solved approximately:

(cid:90) l0

d

a =

(cid:17)

(cid:16) 1

d

Gδ
r2 dr = G δ

− 1
l0

,

(3)

where G is the gravitational constant. Consider a case
where the ﬁlament is not parallel to the sky plane but is
inclined by an angle θ. From the observer, δ(cid:48) = δ/ cos(θ),
d(cid:48) = d cos(θ) and l(cid:48) = l0 cos(θ). Overall, according to Eq. 5,
a(cid:48) = a / cos2(θ). If the ﬁlament is inclined by 45◦, the grav-
itational acceleration will be over-estimated by a factor of
2. A larger inclination leads to a larger error.

For sheet-like structures, inclination has some impacts
on the results but these are in general acceptable. This can
be illustrated by some examples in Burkert & Hartmann
(2004) where the ellipse case shows a good similarity with
the case of the roundish disk. Since we only expect our re-
sults to be accurate in the order-of-magnitude sense, the
error arising from the inclination eﬀect is in general accept-
able.

To sum up, all the projection eﬀects leads to some over-
estimations of the acceleration. The line-of-sight contam-
ination can be avoided in many cases using velocity in-
formation or extinction distance estimates. For clump-like
structures, line-of-sight eﬀects only moderately aﬀect the
computed acceleration structure. For ﬁlaments and sheets,

a moderate inclination can often lead to a change in the
estimated acceleration by a factor of 2, which is accept-
able. The acceleration map computed in this work should
thus capture the general behaviors of gravity in molecular
clouds, but the values in the acceleration map is accurate
only in the order-of-magnitude sense.

3. Acceleration and gas motion
Gravitation acceleration is important for the movement of
gas. Consider that at p1 the acceleration is a1 and at p2 the
acceleration is a2. Initially, both the gas at position p1 an
the gas at position p2 have zero velocities. We are interested
in the eﬀect of acceleration in gas compression / dilation.

At time t, the diﬀerent in separation is simply

δx =

1
2

|a2 − a1| × t2 .

(4)

What actually drives the gas compression, dilatation or
shear is the (vector) diﬀerence in acceleration.

In a region, when the acceleration is larger, it is very
likely that there exist signiﬁcant contrasts in acceleration
with respect to its surroundings. In this work, we choose to
study the acceleration rather than the diﬀerence in acceler-
ation for two reasons: First, in many cases, they are related.
A large acceleration is usually related to a large acceleration
diﬀerence. Second, there are other forces such as magnetic
forces that are inﬂuencing the cloud evolution. To properly
evaluate the impact of gravitational acceleration one need
to compare the acceleration strength with e.g. pressure from
the magnetic ﬁeld. For this purpose, it is more practical to
study acceleration instead of the diﬀerence in acceleration.

4. Applications to idealized examples
We apply the acceleration mapping method to several ide-
alized examples. We consider acceleration from a thin disk,
a ﬁlament and a centrally condensed gas clump.

4.1. Thin disk
In our thin disk example, we consider a disk of a radius
cm−2. The input
of 1 pc and a surface density of 1 g
is smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with σ = 2 pixels,
and we use H = 0.3 pc (see Eq. 1) throughout this paper.
The results are presented in Fig. 2. In the disk case, the
acceleration reaches a maximum at the edge of the disk.
Under ideal situations, matter should accumulate at the
regions where acceleration is enhanced, which was observed
in Burkert & Hartmann (2004).

4.2. Truncated ﬁlament
We consider a ﬁlament with a width of 0.1 pc, a length of
1 pc, and a peak surface density of 1 g cm−2. Along the ﬁl-
ament, the peak surface density is constant. Perpendicular
to the ﬁlament, we assume a Plummer-like density proﬁle:

Σ(r) = Σc

1

1 + (l/lﬂat)p/2

,

(5)

where l is the projected distance to the ridge of the ﬁla-
ment. We take p = 1.6, lﬂat = 0.033 pc and Σc = 1 g cm−2.

acceleration. A color-blindness-proof version of the this ﬁgure and be found in Appendix A.

Integrating over Eq. 5 gives a line mass of 1.27 g cm−2×pc.
The input is smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with σ =
2 pixels. H = 0.3 pc. The results have been shown in Fig.
3. The acceleration reaches its maximum at both ends of the
ﬁlaments, and this should leads to collapse. This eﬀect was
observed in Burkert & Hartmann (2004) and was named
“gravitational focusing” by the authors. Using Eq. 5 and
set d = lﬂat = 0.033 pc, l0 = 1 pc and δ = 1.27 g cm−2 × pc
gives a ≈ 2 × 10−6 cm s−2, in qualitative agreement with
the results in Fig. 3.

Gravity is also responsible for driving accretion onto
dense structures. Heitsch (2013) investigated the accretion
onto dense ﬁlaments, and identiﬁed fan-like structures of
gas velocities on ﬁlament ends. Such fan-like velocity struc-
tures resemble acceleration vectors in Fig. 3.

4.3. Centrally condensed clump
We consider the eﬀect of gravity on a centrally condensed
structure which resembles those seen in observations (e.g.
Kauﬀmann et al. 2010; Larson 1981). We assume

M(cid:12) pc2 = 870 ×(cid:16) r

Σ

(cid:17)−0.7

+ 0.1

pc

,

(6)

where Σ is the surface density and r is the projected dis-
tance from the center. It mimic the structure of a gas con-
densation seen in observations. The gravitational accelera-
tion structures are shown in Fig. 4. Here acceleration vec-
tors converge to the center where the surface density reaches
its maximum, and in this case, it will probably lead to a
continuous accretion ﬂow. The magnitudes of acceleration
vectors are very small at the central region. This is because
of symmetry, which leads the acceleration from the outer
parts of the clump to cancels out.

5. Applications to observational data
After testing the method with the idealized cases, we apply
the method to observational data.

5.1. Pipe Nebula
We obtain extinction maps from Rowles & Froebrich
(2009); Froebrich & Rowles (2010). We use the 25 stars Av
maps which have a pixel size of 0.5 arcsec. The extinction
Av and surface density are linked by (Bohlin et al. 1978)

The Pipe nebula locates at a distance of ∼ 160 pc (Alves
& Franco 2007; Knude & Hog 1998). The cloud contains
∼ 104 M(cid:12), and has an elongated morphology. It is believed
that such a structure is shaped by the expansion of another
Hii region (Gritschneder & Lin 2012). Only ∼ 150 YSOs are
found to be associated with the whole cloud (Kainulainen
et al. 2009; Lombardi et al. 2006). Filamentary structures in
the nebula have been found in recent Herschel observations
(Peretto et al. 2012).

Star formation in the Pipe nebula is relatively quies-
cent, except the B59 region where a cluster of YSOs can be
found (Brooke et al. 2007; Forbrich et al. 2010, 2009). The
physical reason for this uneven distribution of star forma-
tion is still unclear. It is proposed that the star formation
activity is triggered by compression from the nearby Sco
OB2 association (Onishi et al. 1999; Peretto et al. 2012).
Magnetic support might also play a role (Alves et al. 2008).
The Pipe nebula is an ideal target for our analysis, for
two reasons. First, the region have a relatively high galactic
latitude, which makes it relatively easy to separate it from
the background. Second, the region has an elongated mor-
phology, making it an ideal testbed for non-local eﬀects of
gravity.

In Fig. 5 we present surface density and acceleration
structure of Pipe nebula. The extra acceleration on the
lower left edge of the map is due to artifacts, since the
nebula have a ﬁnite surface density inside the map, and out-
side the map it is assumed that the surface density is zero.
Because sharp edges are introduced around the boundaries,
artiﬁcial accelerations arise from the computations (see Sec.
2.3). Therefore these boundary regions are excluded from
our analysis. The acceleration has been enhanced at region

A (see Fig. 5) and the B59 region, and together with the
“stem” region, these three form a system where region A and
the B59 region are the ends of a truncated ﬁlament and the
“stem” region correspond to the “body” of a ﬁlament, and
accelerations are enhanced at the ends of this ﬁlament. The
enhancement of acceleration at the ends results from the
gravitational focusing eﬀect observed in Burkert & Hart-
mann (2004) and in Section 4.2.

In Fig. 6 we present surface density and acceleration
structure of the stem and B59 region of the Pipe Nebula.
YSO candidates from Forbrich et al. (2009) are overlaid.
The B59 region shows up as a region where acceleration
vector converges; this is also the region where the major-
ity of the protostars are found. This implies a connection
between gravitational acceleration and star formation.

The acceleration seen around the B59 region have two
possible sources. The ﬁrst and obvious source of accelera-
tion is the gravity from the central part of the B59 where
the surface density peaks. The second source of accelera-

tion is the gravity contributed from the rest of the Pipe
nebula. To further investigate the origin of acceleration we
repeat the calculation by considering only the gas inside the
B59 region, and compare the results with acceleration map
computed for the whole Pipe nebula. The results are pre-
sented in Fig. 7. Several clear diﬀerences can be identiﬁed.
First, acceleration computed for the B59 region alone con-
verges to its center, and when the gravity of the whole Pipe
nebula has been taken into account, acceleration only con-
verges through the north-western part, and acceleration at
the south-eastern part of the B59 region is suppressed. This
diﬀerence is due to the contribution from gas the belongs
to the Pipe nebula but outside the B59 region. Second, the
magnitude of acceleration at the north-eastern part of the
the B59 region is much higher when the gravity of the whole
Pipe nebula have been taken into account, which indicates
that gas from the whole Pipe nebula is contributing sig-
niﬁcantly to the gravitational acceleration observed in the

region signiﬁcantly.

5.2. NGC1333 cluster-forming region
Centrally condensed gas clumps are common in star-
forming regions. On such example is the cluster-forming
region NGC1333 in the Perseus molecular cloud.

We obtain extinction map of the Perseus molecular
cloud from the COMPLETE (Ridge et al. 2006) survey.
First, we compute the gravitational acceleration for the
whole region. Then we zoom into the NGC1333 region and
study the structure. A distance of 250 pc is used in our
calculations (Knude & Hog 1998).

The results for the whole Perseus region is shown in Fig.
8, and the acceleration map exhibits a variety of behaviors
in diﬀerent regions.

The results for NGC1333 are presented in Fig. 9. Here
the acceleration has a relatively symmetric structure, and
converges towards the center. This is mainly due to the

eration of the IC348-B3 region in the Perseus molecular cloud.

mass concentration at the center of the region. In this case,
gravity can potentially drive the accretion from the out-
skirts towards the center. This behavior is similar to what
is found in Section 4.3 for the simpliﬁed centrally condensed
clump model.

5.3. IC348-B3 star-forming region

We consider acceleration in a highly irregular region –
the IC348-B3 star-forming region in the Perseus molecular
cloud. The region is considered to be more evolved (Guter-
muth et al. 2009), and a young embedded cluster IC348 is
found to be associated with the region.

In Fig. 10 we present the results. Positions of the dense
cores are taken from Enoch et al. (2006), and they are
marked with the red contours. Here acceleration concen-
trates at the edges of the cloud. The region where acceler-
ation is enhanced coincide with the region where the dense
cores are found. In this sense, the IC348 region resembles
the case of the “Ghost” studied in Burkert & Hartmann
(2004). This resemblance points to a picture where the star
formation in the IC348 region traced by the dense cores are
triggered because of the enhanced gravitational acceleration
at the edges of the region.

version of the this ﬁgure and be found in Appendix A.

In the inner part of the IC348-B3 region, albeit the pres-
ence of gas, the acceleration is reduced because of the ap-
parent sheet-like geometry. This lack of acceleration should
lead to a lack of the ability of the gas to collapse and hence
a lack of star formation. Indeed, none of the dense cores in
Enoch et al. (2006) are found at the inner part of the IC348-
B3. This is similar to the thin disk example as discussed in
Section 4.1.

6. Discussions
6.1. General importance
The acceleration map can be combined with the map of
surface density to estimate the importance of gravity in
accelerating the gas. This can be achieved by multiplying |a|
with the surface density map Σ. The eﬀective acceleration
pressure is

S

where a3D is the 3D acceleration and a2D is the 2D pro-
jected acceleration. We assume that |a3D| ∼ |a2D|.
Eq. 8 provides an order-of-magnitude estimate of the
importance of acceleration in molecular clouds, and can be
used to obtain maps of the importance of acceleration on
the sky plane.
In the localized regions, the eﬀective acceleration pres-
sure can reach p ∼ 10−9g cm−1 s−2, which correspond to
˙p/kB ∼ 107 K cm−3 where kB is the Boltzmann’s constant.
This is much larger than the external ambient pressure of

molecular clouds estimated in previous works (Heyer et al.
2009; Field et al. 2011) 1.

The comparison between the eﬀective pressure and the
ambient pressure provides estimates on the importance of
gravitational acceleration. However, because our calcula-
tions are done in 2D rather than in 3D, the results needs to
be interpreted with caution. The pressure is isotropic, and
the momentum injection from acceleration is anisotropic.
Consider a 3D cuboid of a size (lx, ly, lz) where z stand for
the direction of the line of sight, and the acceleration points
toward the y direction. The momentum injection from grav-
itational acceleration is ˙Paccel ≈ ρaylxlylz ≈ Σay × lxly ≈
paccellxly where Σ is the surface density. The momentum
injection from the ambient pressure along the y direction is
˙Ppressure ≈ pambientlxlz where pambient is the ambient pres-
˙Paccel/ ˙Ppressure ≈ paccel/pambient requires ly ≈ lz. In
sure.
other words, the ratio between paccel and pambient is a mean-
ingful representation of the relative importance between ac-
celeration and ambient pressure only when the region is
only moderately extended along the line of sight. When the
region is highly elongated along the line of sight, the im-
portance of the eﬀective acceleration pressure will be over-
estimated.

1 In Field et al. (2011), the cloud ambient pressure is estimated
to range from 104 to 107 K cm−3. Our estimate stays on the
upper end. For the Pipe Nebula, Lada et al. (2008) estimated a
pressure of 7 × 104K cm−3 for the whole region. This pressure
is small (by about two orders of magnitudes) compared to the
eﬀective gravitational acceleration pressure.

In our acceleration map, paccel can be 100 times stronger
than the local ambient pressure. External pressure can be
important of the cloud as a whole, but gravitational accel-
eration will be extremely eﬀective in the localized regions.
We also derive the timescale on which gravitational ac-
celeration can change the concentration of the gas signiﬁ-
cantly. Observationally, it is found that dense gas concen-
trate in clumps and ﬁlaments, and the clumps are typically

∼ 1pc large (Molinari et al. 2000; Beuther et al. 2002).
For acceleration to create such gas clumps, we have ( us-

Guang-Xing Li et al.: Gravitational acceleration mapping

other factors such as magnetic ﬁelds, gravitational acceler-
ation can potentially trigger fast collapses in the localized
regions.

6.2. Diverse behaviors
We ﬁnd that gravitational acceleration exhibits diverse be-
haviors in various regions, which can be summarized in Fig.
13.

In the Pipe nebula, we ﬁnd that acceleration concen-
trates at the B59 region. The acceleration structure of the
Pipe nebula can be explained by the “gravitational focus-
ing” eﬀect proposed by Burkert & Hartmann (2004). Sim-
ilar phenomena are seen in many of the recently-observed
ﬁlaments (Li et al. 2015b; Kainulainen et al. 2015; Beuther
et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2014),

We also the method to the Perseus molecular cloud, and
ﬁnd that in the IC348-B3 region both the acceleration and
the formation of dense gas tend to occur at the edges of
the region, and this is consistent with the “edge collapse” in
Burkert & Hartmann (2004). Acceleration in the NGC1333
cluster-forming region converges towards the center, indi-
cating that gravity can collect matter towards the center of
the region and feed star formation. In sum, we that grav-
itational acceleration plays important roles at least in the
following ways:

1. In driving the accretion onto the central parts of

centrally-condense regions (accretion).

2. In driving the collapse at the ends of the ﬁlamentary

structures (gravitational focusing).

3. In driving the collapse at edges of ﬂat structures (edge

collapse).

The various ways in which gravitational acceleration func-
tions are summarized in Fig. 13. It should be noted that
in many cases these diﬀerent mechanisms occur simultane-
ously. One example is the gas accretion at the ends of a
ﬁlament. In this case, gravitational focusing is responsible
for the collapse of the ﬁlament ends, and if a diﬀuse enve-
lope exists around the ﬁlament, accretion will occur which
brings gas from the diﬀuse phase to the ends of the ﬁlament
(Heitsch 2013).

7. Conclusions & Discussions
In this work, we present a gravitational acceleration map-
ping method to quantify the importance of gravity in molec-
ular clouds, and study the impact of gravitational acceler-
ation on the evolution of molecular clouds.

The method takes observational maps of surface density
distributions on the sky plane as the inputs, and provides
maps of the gravitational acceleration on the sky plane.
It provides a qualitative and intuitive picture of gravity
in molecular clouds. We apply our method to both simpli-
ﬁed models and observations including Pipe nebula and the
Perseus molecular cloud.

With observational data, we ﬁnd that the star forma-
tion activities in the IC-348 region traced by dense cores can
be explained by edge collapse, and the concentration of star
formation in the B59 region of the Pipe nebula is consistent
with a picture where gravitational focusing contributes to
the compression of the gas. In the NGC1333 cluster-forming
region, acceleration can drive accretion from the outskirts

to the center. The main observational results are summa-
rized as follows:

– Gravitational acceleration exhibits diverse behaviors in

various regions.

– Gravitational acceleration tends to concentrate in the

localized regions in molecular clouds.

– In the localized regions, the strength of the acceleration
exceeds by much the mean external pressure of molecu-
lar clouds.

– In the localized regions, the concentration of accelera-
tion can lead to local collapse. The local collapse can
occur in a timescale that is much shorter (e.g. 106 yr)
than the dynamical timescale of the cloud.

However, a complete picture of gas evolution is yet to
be achieved since we need to fully understand the inter-
play between magnetic ﬁeld, turbulence and gravity in these
these regions. There are ample observational evidences that
magnetic ﬁelds are important in star-forming regions (Li
et al. 2014). Remarkably-ordered magnetic ﬁelds have been
revealed in several star-forming regions (Qiu et al. 2014;
Zhang et al. 2014; Alves et al. 2008; Chapman et al. 2011;
Planck Collaboration et al. 2015; Li et al. 2015b). Magnetic
ﬁelds are observed to be either parallel or perpendicular to
ﬁlamentary structures (Zhang et al. 2014; Planck Collab-
oration et al. 2015). Magnetic ﬁeld strength can also vary
strongly within diﬀerent star-forming regions (e.g. Alves
et al. 2008). Strong magnetic ﬁeld can aﬀect fragmentation
signiﬁcantly (Seifried & Walch 2015). The eﬀect of turbu-
lence is not considered explicitly in this formalism. It is
possible that in regions such as B59, turbulent motion can
be driven as a result of the enhanced acceleration (Klessen
& Hennebelle 2010). These possibilities should be investi-
gated in subsequent works.

The Milky Way ISM is in general structured. We expect
that the non-local eﬀect of gravity to be important in the
majorities of the cases. The acceleration mapping method
presented in this paper provides a detailed and intuitive
picture of gravity in the molecular ISM. The results can be
combined with studies of turbulent motions and magnetic
ﬁeld observations to ﬁnally achieve a clear picture of star
formation.

Fig. A.5. Upper Panel: surface density distribution and acceleration of the Pipe Nebula. The background image is the surface
density distribution and the vectors stand for acceleration. Lower Panel: A map of the magnitude of acceleration of the same
region. The red stars stand for the YSO candidates in (Forbrich et al. 2009). Here one degree correspond to ∼ 3 pc.

Fig. A.6. Upper Panels: surface density maps and acceleration of the B59 region in the Pipe Nebula. The background images
are the surface density distributions and the vectors stand for acceleration. Lower Panels: Maps of the magnitude of acceleration
of the same region. The red stars stand for the YSO candidates in Forbrich et al. (2009). The results shown in the left panels are
computed by taking all the matter of the Pipe nebula into account (whole cloud), and the results shown in the right panels are
computed by taking only the matter inside the B59 into account (B59 only). Here one degree correspond to ∼ 3 pc.
