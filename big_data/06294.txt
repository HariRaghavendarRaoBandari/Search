The spontaneous formation of patterns in dynamical systems is a rich non-
equilibrium phenomenon that is studied in ﬁelds ranging from atomic physics to
cosmology. Here, we report our observation of coupled optical-atomic pattern for-
mation, which results in the creation of self-organized, multimode structures in free-
space laser-driven cold atoms. We show that this process gives rise to spontaneous
three-dimensional Sisyphus cooling even at very low light intensities and the emer-
gence of self-organized atomic structures on multiple spatial scales.

Optical lattices are a useful experimental tool for studying the interaction between
light and ultracold atoms, where the lattice creates a spatially-dependent force on atoms,
resulting in atom trapping. Spatially bunched atoms can be used to simulate quantum
systems [1] and to study novel states of matter [2]. These applications often require only a
small number of atoms per lattice site, but new physics is expected when there are many
atoms per site [3].

In the high atom-number regime, the light scattered by the atoms can be substantial
and aﬀect the atoms’ center-of-mass degrees-of-freedom. Early experiments exploring this
regime used single-mode optical cavities to enhance the light-atom coupling strength [4].
Alternatively, we have shown theoretically that strong light-atom coupling can be achieved
in free space by allowing many sub-Doppler-cooled atoms to spatially bunch in the intensity
maxima of an optical lattice [5]. Free-space systems are advantageous for many reasons,
including experimental simplicity and access to an intrinsically multimode system [6, 7].
Strong light-atom interactions in multimode geometries allow access to diﬀerent physics,
such as the realization of spin glasses [3].

In this Letter, we realize enhanced light-atom interactions in a multimode, free-space
cloud of ultracold atoms driven by counterpropagating optical ﬁelds. Above a threshold
value of the nonlinear refractive index, denoted nNL, we observe an instability that simulta-
neously generates new optical ﬁelds and new real-space gratings of atoms, which we refer to
as optical/atomic pattern formation. The optical and atomic patterns enhance each other
because the generated ﬁelds give rise to atomic bunching and cooling, which in turn give
rise to increased optical scattering. This results in a runaway process, known as an absolute
instability, where an initial atom/ﬁeld ﬂuctuation triggers macroscopic pattern formation.
While other cold-atom systems have observed the spontaneous emergence of multimode
optical ﬁelds [6, 7], they have not directly observed a corresponding self-organization of
the atoms. Here, we demonstrate that the light-atom synergy generates real-space self-

organization of atoms in a multimode system. We also ﬁnd that the atoms cool in 3D
despite only applying ﬁelds in one dimension. Three-dimensional Sisyphus cooling has pre-
viously been studied using 3D applied optical lattices to realize longer coherence times [8],
but it has not yet been observed to occur spontaneously. We also ﬁnd that the self-organized
patterns exhibit continuous symmetry-breaking as well as long-range ordering on both sub-
and super-wavelength scales. Finally, we observe pattern formation at ultra-low intensities,
which allows for studies of low-light-level nonlinear optics and non-equilibrium phenomena
in a structured, multimode system, and provides a novel material for studying the sponta-
neous formation of patterns and the nature of absolute instabilities.
Our free-space experiment consists of an elongated sample of sub-Doppler-cooled 87Rb
atoms created in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of length L = 3 cm and diameter ∼400 µm
that are initially cooled to a temperature T (cid:39) 30 µK [9], which is well below the Doppler
temperature TD = 146 µK. The typical on-resonance optical depths are 50− 100 along the
long trap axis with an average density of na ∼ 1010 atoms/cm3. After loading the MOT
for 97 ms, we apply counterpropagating optical ﬁelds (wavelength λ ∼ 780 nm, beam waist
∼ 410 µm, 1/e2 diameter) in a lin⊥lin polarization conﬁguration along the long axis of
the atomic cloud for 3 ms, which form an imposed 1D optical lattice with ∼200 atoms
per site. The total applied electric ﬁeld is given by (cid:126)E(z, t) = (cid:126)E0(z)e−iωt + c.c., where
(cid:126)E0(z) = F (z)eikz ˆx + iB(z)e−ikz ˆy, k is the vacuum wavenumber, ω is the frequency, and i is
an arbitrary phase chosen to set the polarization to ˆσ− at z = 0. While the total intensity of
this electric ﬁeld is constant in space, the polarization is spatially varying, which gives rise
to a spatially-modulated AC Stark shift in the atomic energy states [10]. When the pump
ﬁelds have a detuning ∆ = ω − ωeg below the atomic resonant frequency ωeg (∆ < 0), the
atoms undergo initial Sisyphus cooling along the long ˆz-axis [11]. After ∼ 30 µs, the mean
temperature of the gas along ˆz is cooled to Tz (cid:39) 2 − 3 µK, while the mean temperature
in the radial directions is still Trad (cid:39) 30 µK [12]. We typically use ∆ = −4Γ to −10Γ,
where Γ = 2π × (6 MHz) is the natural linewidth of the 52S1/2 (F = 2) → 52P3/2 (F = 3)
atomic transition, which is close enough to the resonance to observe pattern formation, but
far enough to avoid substantial absorption. This regime is atypical for lattice experiments,
where typically |∆| (cid:29) 100 Γ [13], and hence operate with comparatively weak atom-ﬁeld
interaction strengths.

The spatially-varying AC Stark shift of the applied optical lattice forms two superim-

posed dipole potentials, the total of which goes as U (z) = U +(z) + U−(z) [11], where

correspond to the dipole potentials for the mJ = ±1/2 ground states for a J = 1/2 → J(cid:48) =
3/2 atomic transition. This simpliﬁed ﬁne-structure model provides a good qualitative
understanding of our experiment because most (∼90%) of the atoms are tightly bunched
at regions of pure ˆσ+/ˆσ− polarization and pumped into the F = 2, mF = ±2 ground
states [12]. The wavenumber of the pump ﬁelds propagating through the atomic cloud is
k(cid:48) = kn for atoms with an eﬀective index of refraction n, deﬁned below. The maximum

bunching, i.e., inﬁnitely thin sheets of atoms organized at the dipole potential minima of
the optical lattice [16]. By increasing η±
1 for ∆ < 0, the light-atom coupling strength is
enhanced because atoms bunch tightly at the intensity maxima of the optical lattice. As
can be seen from Eq. 4, atomic bunching provides a new mechanism to achieve enhanced
nonlinear light-atom interactions even for I/Isat (cid:28) 1 by using small |∆|, which increases
the dipole potential well depth, and by using small Tz (e.g., via Sisyphus cooling) [5]. In
this tight-bunching regime with I/Isat (cid:28) 1, the eﬀective refractive index is

where χlin = −6πc3(2∆/Γ)naC 2/[ω3
the intensity-independent terms are the linear refractive index nlin.
The threshold for the pattern-forming instability occurs when the nonlinear optical phase
shift knNLL (cid:38) π/2 [17], which is achievable at low intensities using our long atomic sample
and sub-Doppler temperatures [5]. The minimum observed threshold for pattern formation
in our system is I/Isat (cid:39) 10−2 for ∆ = −4Γ (η±
1 (cid:39) 0.7 and |ζ| (cid:39) 2) and an optical depth of
∼50, where knNLL ≈ 1.6. This threshold intensity is two orders of magnitude smaller than
for optical pattern formation in a warm vapor [18]. Our typical experimental parameters
are 10−2 ≤ I/Isat ≤ 0.3, where η±
1 (cid:39) 0.7 − 0.99 and |ζ| (cid:39) 2 − 120. This indicates that
the atoms are cooled substantially and tightly bunched in the applied 1D optical lattice,
as depicted in Fig. 1(a), in order to generate the instability that gives rise to pattern
formation. From Eq. 3, the peak density at each pump-pump lattice site at threshold is
∼ 5na, and the width of each pancake is ∼λ/13 [19].
The instability triggers a wave-mixing process that generates new, frequency-degenerate
optical ﬁelds, which propagate at a small angle θ ∼ 3 − 10 mrad relative to the applied
ﬁelds [12], as dictated by a phase-matching condition [17]. In theory, the generated ﬁelds
arise anywhere along a cone centered on the ˆz-axis, as depicted in Fig. 1(b). In the trans-
verse plane, we observe multi-spot optical patterns shown in Fig. 1(c) rather than a con-
tinuous ring, which indicates a spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry [20]. In
addition, we observe diﬀerent patterns under essentially the same experimental conditions,
as shown in Fig. 1(c). Such shot-to-shot ﬂuctuations are a hallmark of non-equilibrium phe-
nomena, where symmetry-breaking results in self-organization into diﬀerent modes [21, 22].
We also observe that these patterns are not necessarily stationary and can rotate around
the allowed cone of emission [15].

The synergistic coupling between the optical patterns and the atoms implies that there
are also corresponding real-space patterns of bunched atoms. There are two types of atomic
patterns: one with a short (sub-wavelength) period, and one with a long period. The
short-period gratings (spacing ds (cid:39) π/[2k(cid:48)cos(θ/2)] ≈ 195 nm) overlap strongly with the
imposed pump-pump grating (spacing dp = π/2k(cid:48)) and arise due to the interference of
a generated optical ﬁeld with a nearly counterpropagating pump ﬁeld. The long-period
gratings (spacing d(cid:96) (cid:39) π/[2k(cid:48)sin(θ/2)] ≈ 80 µm) arise due to the interference of a generated
optical ﬁeld with a nearly co-propagating pump ﬁeld, as depicted in Fig. 2(b).

I/Isat = 10−3, width ∼1.2 mm, and length ∼4 cm applied to the side of the atomic cloud (along
−ˆr). Experimental data is shown in gray circles, and the best ﬁts to a sum of Lorentzians
are the blue curves. The modulation depth of the resonance associated with the short-period
grating is larger than that of the pump-pump resonance because more atoms are driven out
of the shallower dipole potential wells for a given phase shift. We attribute the resonance at
ωmod/2π = 177 ± 15 kHz (width 213 ± 34 kHz) to a perturbation in the potential that arises due
to the pump beam reshaping discussed in the caption of Fig. 1(c) [23]. The error bars indicate
the conﬁdence interval of the ﬁt at the locations of the parametric resonances.

The total (applied and generated) electric ﬁeld for a two-spot optical pattern is denoted
by (cid:126)E(z, r, t) = [ (cid:126)E0(z) + (cid:126)Ew(z, r)]e−iωt + c.c., where (cid:126)Ew(z, r) = if±(z, r)eik(zcosθ±rsinθ) ˆy +
b±(z, r)eik(−zcosθ±rsinθ) ˆx. Here, we ignore higher-order spatial-mode patterns for sim-
plicity. With these additional ﬁeld terms, Eqs. 1 and 3 are also modiﬁed so that
the density distribution incorporates the self-organized atomic patterns, with cor-

wavevectors are (cid:126)g(cid:96) (cid:39) k(cid:48) {±[1 − cos(θ)]ˆz ± sin(θ)ˆr}, which are nearly along ˆr. The Fourier
coeﬃcients for the self-organized atomic density gratings are analogous to Eq. 4, but with
ζ → ζs,(cid:96) = Udip,(s,(cid:96))/kBTs,(cid:96), where Udip,(s,(cid:96)) refers to the eﬀective dipole potential of the
short-period (s) and long-period ((cid:96)) gratings, and Ts,(cid:96) refers to the atomic temperature
along ˆgs,(cid:96). Both Udip,(s,(cid:96)) and Ts,(cid:96) are measured experimentally, as described below.

We perform a parametric resonance experiment to measure the motional energy states
of the atoms in the self-organized gratings. The motional frequencies of atoms in the
lowest-energy bound states oscillate according to

where m is the atomic mass, and we assume the potentials are nearly harmonic. Atoms

can be excited out of their dipole potential wells by parametrically driving at the resonance
2ωvib along the direction of the grating wavectors [24]. Because ˆg(cid:96) is nearly orthogonal to
ˆgp and ˆgs, we use diﬀerent experimental methods to parametrically drive atoms in each
type of grating. When we excite a parametric resonance, atoms leave the lattice, which
reduces the eﬃciency of the wave-mixing process.

To excite atoms in the short-period grating, we use an electro-optic phase modulator
placed in the path of one of the pump ﬁelds and driven at frequency ωmod. During this
experiment, we slightly misalign the pump beams to observe a stationary two-spot optical
pattern and avoid detection errors due to pattern rotation. We observe two distinct res-
onances, as seen in Fig. 2(c). The high-frequency resonance at ωmod/2π (cid:39) 632 ± 30 kHz
(width 258 ± 26 kHz) corresponds to atoms trapped in the pump-pump (applied) lat-
tice, where we attribute the width to the anharmonicity of the potential well [24]. We
expect this resonance at 2ωvib/2π (cid:39) 686(+123/ − 109) kHz according to Eq. 6 for
Udip,p ≡ U0 with experimental parameters ∆ (cid:39) −5Γ, I/Isat = 0.28, and C 2 → 1 well
above threshold [23]. The low-frequency resonance at ωmod/2π = 92 ± 1 kHz (width
33 ± 2 kHz) corresponds to atoms in the short-period self-organized gratings, which we
expect to occur at ωmod/2π = 95 (+12/ − 9) kHz for a measured generated ﬁeld intensity
of (17 ± 6) µW/cm2 [23]. Using Eq. 6, we ﬁnd that Udip,p ∼ 635 µK and Udip,s ∼ 13 µK
(where the energy is normalized by kB/2). The observation of this low-frequency motional
resonance provides unambiguous proof that the atoms self-organize into structures that are
not imposed on the atoms by the applied ﬁelds. For the 6-spot pattern shown in Fig. 1(c),
we estimate there are ∼7 short-period grating lattice sites per pancake with ∼20 atoms per
site.

To investigate the motional properties of atoms in the long-period gratings, we apply a
weak elliptically-shaped optical ﬁeld to the side of the atomic cloud and periodically modu-
late its amplitude. We observe a parametric resonance at ωmod/2π = 134± 2 Hz [Fig. 2(d)]
(width 50 ± 7 Hz), which we expect to occur at ωmod/2π = 191 (+78/ − 62) Hz [23]. From
this measurement, we ﬁnd that Udip,l = 8 ± 4 µK. Because ˆg(cid:96) ≈ ˆr, one might expect
Tl ≈ Trad, which would imply ζl < 1 and negligible bunching into the long-period gratings.
However, as we show below, this is not the case.

We use Bragg scattering to determine the temperatures of the atoms trapped in the self-
generated lattices [25]. Here, we apply the counterpropagating pump ﬁelds and allow the
optical patterns to form and persist for 200 µs. We then shut oﬀ the pump ﬁelds and inject
a weak probe beam along either the ±ˆz-direction. We only collect light from a portion of
one of the emission cones, as depicted in Fig. 1(b). In this case, a probe beam traveling
along −ˆz (+ˆz) is Bragg-matched to scatter into multiple directions, but it will only reach
the detector if it back-scatters (forward-scatters) oﬀ the short-period (long-period) gratings
depicted in Fig. 2(a) [(b)] [23]. Ballistic expansion of atoms out of their gratings results in
the decay of the probe signal, as shown in Fig. 3.

We ﬁt the data in Fig. 3(a),(b) to a Gaussian decay function fs,(cid:96)(t) = aexp(−t2/τ 2

s,(cid:96)) [25],
where τs,(cid:96) correspond to the time it takes for nNL to reduce to 1/e of its initial value as
a result of ballistic expansion of atoms out of their gratings. Because d(cid:96) (cid:29) ds, the peak
density in the long-period gratings decays more slowly and consequently τ(cid:96) (cid:29) τs.

We perform multiple Bragg scattering experiments to extract τs and τ(cid:96) for various pump

intensities. We use a heuristic model that relates τs and τ(cid:96) to an atomic temperature
by modeling η(z, r) before and after ballistic expansion [23]. Figure 3(c)/(d) shows the
atomic temperature for atoms in the short/long-period gratings. The atomic temperature
is Ts ≈ 1.8 − 2.8 µK along ˆgs and T(cid:96) ≈ 1.9 − 2.7 µK along ˆg(cid:96) for all pump intensities.
We interpret the slight upward trend as a result of the fact that Sisyphus cooling operates
optimally over a limited range of intensities [11].

The low temperatures along ˆgs are expected because atoms in these gratings substan-
tially overlap with the imposed gratings and therefore have the advantage of undergoing
initial Sisyphus cooling due to the applied ﬁelds. However, we also observe that atoms
in the long-period gratings cool to comparable temperatures despite having a momentum
state nearly orthogonal to ˆz. Such transverse cooling can arise either due to a weak trans-
verse dipole force in a 1D optical lattice [26] or due to 3D Sisyphus cooling above threshold
for pattern formation. However, it would take approximately 600 µs for the atoms to move
a distance d(cid:96) under the inﬂuence of the weak transverse dipole force imposed by the 1D
lattice. In contrast, we have observed the signature of these long-period gratings as soon
as 20 µs after turning on the pump beams. We conclude that the only mechanism that
can cool and trap atoms so quickly and eﬀectively is Sisyphus cooling, where the expected
damping time is [k2|∆|/(2mΓ)]−1 ≈ 10 µs [10]. Therefore, the optical/atomic pattern-
forming instability causes spontaneous 3D Sisyphus cooling.

In conclusion, we have observed spontaneous self-organization of atoms in a multimode
geometry, and we have measured the motional states and temperature of atoms in the
self-generated dipole potential wells. Our system exhibits continuous symmetry-breaking,
long-range atomic self-structuring in multiple spatial dimensions, and spontaneous three-
dimensional Sisyphus cooling. Our work represents an important step towards studying

non-equilibrium phenomena in multimode geometries and provides a simpliﬁed system in
which one can observe low-light-level, multidimensional nonlinear optical eﬀects.
