The quantum phase transition between two clean, non interacting topologically distinct gapped
states in three dimensions is governed by a massless Dirac fermion ﬁxed point, irrespective of the
underlying symmetry class, and this constitutes a remarkably simple example of superuniversality.
For dirty systems, the notion of a sharp spectral gap is invalidated by the disorder induced sub-gap
states and their localization is essential for describing topological and trivial insulators. For a suﬃ-
ciently weak disorder strength, we show that the massless Dirac ﬁxed point controls a direct quantum
phase transition between two topologically distinct localized phases, with a dynamic scaling expo-
nent z = 1 and a localization length exponent νM = 1, implying the robustness of superuniversality.
We establish this by considering both perturbative and nonperturbative eﬀects of disorder. The su-
peruniversality breaks down at a critical strength of disorder, beyond which the topologically distinct
localized phases become separated by a delocalized diﬀusive phase, allowing for only localization-
delocalization (metal-insulator) transitions.
In the global phase diagram the disorder controlled
ﬁxed point where superuniversality disappears actually serves as a multicritical point, where two
localized and the delocalized diﬀusive phases meet. The nature of the localization-delocalization
transition depends on the underlying symmetry class. Based on these features we construct the
global phase diagrams of noninteracting, dirty topological systems in three dimensions. For particle
hole symmetric disorders, we argue that the localization length exponent at the multicritical point
is νM = 2/3, which saturates the bound provided by Chayes-Chayes-Fisher-Spencer theorem. .

INTRODUCTION

Understanding of continuous transition between topo-
logically distinct states of matter enriches our under-
standing of scale invariance and universality, and also
gives rise to new concepts and challenges. In the context
of charge quantum Hall plateau transitions, an additional
notion of superuniversality has been proposed by several
authors1–4. Based on the topological Chern-Simons the-
ories as well as theta vacuum of nonlinear sigma model
in the unitary class, it has been argued that the local-
ization delocalization transitions between diﬀerent quan-
tum Hall plateaus display same correlation length and
dynamic scaling exponents1–4.
In addition, it has also
been conjectured that the critical conductances at dif-
ferent plateau transitions are related by modular trans-
formations, further supporting the idea of an underlying
superuniversality 2,3. Therefore superuniversality is con-
sidered to be an essential ingredient toward an overall
understanding of the global phase diagram1 of quantum
Hall systems3,4.

In recent years there has been a great surge of inter-
est in three dimensional topological states of matter5–12.
In this context a fundamental question arises if there is
any superuniversality for topological phase transitions in
three dimensions, and if it can play any role in determin-

ing the global phase diagrams for three dimensional topo-
logical states of matter. The Altland Zirnbauer (AZ)13
classiﬁcation of random matrices plays an important role
in obtaining the topological distinction of localized states
of noninteracting fermions. We note that the AZ classiﬁ-
cation is applicable for describing the quasiparticles of a
broken symmetry phase [such as Bogoliubov-de Gennes
(BdG) quasiparticles of a superﬂuid or superconductor]
of interacting fermions at a mean-ﬁeld level. For the sake
of convenience here we have reproduced the AZ classiﬁ-
cation in Table I. In three dimensions, the topologically
nontrivial states can arise for ﬁve symmetry classes AII,
AIII, CII, DIII and CI.

The simplest way of understanding the possible topo-
logical phases is to consider Hamiltonians of clean
gapped states within the above ﬁve symmetry classes.
The topological classiﬁcation is then obtained by deﬁn-
ing appropriate topological
invariants in the momen-
tum space. From this perspective,
it has been rec-
ognized for sometime that a four component mass-
less Dirac fermion describes the transition between
topologically distinct gapped states14–18 in symmetry
classes AII, AIII and DIII. There are some experimen-
tal evidence for such a quantum critical point sepa-
rating spin-orbit coupled topological and trivial insula-
tors in class AII in Bi1−xSbx
22,23

19–21 BiTl(S1−δSeδ)2

and (Bi1−xInx)2Se3
24–26, and we note that this critical
Dirac semimetal (with odd number of Dirac cones) is
distinct from the symmetry protected topological Dirac
semimetal phase with two Dirac cones as observed in
Cd3As2 and Na3Bi27,29–32. For describing the QPTs in
the symmetry classes CI and CII, an eight component
massless Dirac fermion is required as a minimal model of
critical excitations10,18. Since the massless Dirac Hamil-
tonian describes a quantum critical system with dynamic
scaling exponent z = 1 and a correlation length expo-
nent νM = 1 (scaling dimension of Dirac mass), we have
an unambiguous example of superuniversality for three
dimensional topological quantum phase transitions for
clean systems, and several critical properties can be ob-
tained from this simple observation17. For one and two
dimensional clean, gapped systems one arrives at a sim-
ilar conclusion for the direct topological quantum phase
transitions. This is a strong form of superuniversality
that uniﬁes the nature of topological quantum criticality
across diﬀerent symmetry classes.

TABLE I: The Altland-Zirnubauer symmetry classes and al-
lowed topological invariants for distinguishing gapped phases
within a given class. Here TRS and SRS respectively denote
time reversal symmetry and SU(2) spin rotational symme-
try. First three classes follow from the conventional ‘Wigner-
Dyson’ classiﬁcation. The next three chiral classes are ob-
tained by imposing an additional discrete sublattice or chi-
ral symmetry on the ‘Wigner-Dyson” classes. The last four
classes can only occur for superconducting or superﬂuid sys-
tems that break particle-number conservation. Two unitary
classes A and AIII can also describe superconducting systems.
In particular the class AIII is special in a sense that it can de-
scribe a time-reversal invariant superconducting state which
breaks SU(2) SRS but preserves a U(1) subgroup of it.

Realistic condensed matter systems inevitably contain
disorder, which induces sub-gap states. Hence the notion
of a sharp spectral gap becomes invalid, and akin to the
situation for integer quantum Hall eﬀect, the localization
of quasiparticles has to be invoked for properly deﬁning
the topologically distinct insulating states. Can there be
still a direct topological phase transition in the presence
of disorder in all three dimensions, and can it be still
described by the massless Dirac fermion? The renor-

2

malization group (RG) and nonperturbative numerical
analyses are some important tools for addressing these
questions. In this regard the spatial dimensionality and
the underlying symmetry class generally play important
roles. When the delocalized, diﬀusive phase is absent in
spatial dimensions d for a given symmetry class support-
ing topologically distinct localized states, we can infer
the existence of a direct topological transition even in the
presence of disorder. Since no stable delocalized diﬀusive
phase is allowed in d=1, we expect two topologically dis-
tinct localized states to remain separated by a critical
delocalized state in the presence of disorder. However,
the massless Dirac ﬁxed point in d=1 is unstable against
inﬁnitesimally weak disorder (a strongly relevant pertur-
bation), and the superuniversality of clean gapped sys-
tem is destroyed by randomness. Instead several exact
analytical and numerical results establish the existence
of inﬁnite randomness critical points, and the disorder
controlled QCPs exhibit superuniversality for all ﬁve AZ
classes AIII, BDI, CII, D and DIII (as far as the corre-
lation length exponent and activated dynamical scaling
are concerned)33. Can there be similar superuniversality
for the topological QPTs in higher spatial dimensions in
the presence of disorder?

Addressing this issue of superuniversality and con-
struction of global phase diagrams in three dimensions
are the motivations for our present work. In three dimen-
sions a stable diﬀusive phase can be supported by any AZ
symmetry class. Therefore we can expect a regime where
two localized phases will remain separated by a diﬀusive
phase for any symmetry class, and in this regime the no-
tion of superuniversality is absent. For suﬃciently weak
disorder in d = 3, we show superuniversality involving
massless Dirac ﬁxed point remains unaﬀected. The supe-
runiversality breaks down at a disorder controlled mul-
ticritical point where the two insulating/localized states
and the diﬀusive metal meet, as shown in Fig. 1. For
classes DIII, AIII, CI and CII with particle-hole symmet-
ric disorder we predict the localization length exponent
for the multicritical point to be νM = 2/3.

Previously we have addressed the eﬀects of generic
time-reversal invariant disorder and Coulomb interac-
tions on the topological QPT in three spatial dimensions
for class AII17. Beyond the critical disorder strength
associated with a semimetal to metal QPT16–18,34, the
topologically distinct insulating states become sepa-
rated by a diﬀusive metallic phase, allowing only metal-
insulator transitions. The perturbative calculations of
the critical properties within the one loop approximation
(leading order d = 2 +  expansion) suggest

z = 3/2, ν∆ = 1, νM = 2,

(1)

where ν∆ is the correlation length exponent of the disor-
der (describes the divergence of the mean free path in-
side the diﬀusive metal). The predictions regarding the
structure of the phase diagram and the dynamic scaling
exponent have been conﬁrmed through nonperturbative
numerical analysis35,36. Since all disorder perturbations

at the three dimensional massless Dirac ﬁxed point are
irrelevant in the renormalization group sense, the supe-
runiversality of the clean QCP has been found to re-
main unaltered by weak disorder. Recently, the related
semimetal-metal transition for Dirac and Weyl semimet-
als are being intensively studied through analytical37–40
and numerical calculations41–48. Even though there is
a general agreement regarding z ∼ 3/2, there are un-
certainties over the precise value of ν∆. However the
numerical determination of νM is still an open problem.
Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we con-
sider the clean, noninteracting Hamiltonian of diﬀerent
symmetry classes and elucidate the notion of superuni-
versality of massless Dirac fermion ﬁxed point. In Sec. III
we formulate a generalized Harris criterion for the stabil-
ity of massless Dirac ﬁxed point against diﬀerent types of
disorder, which can also be applied for assessing the sta-
bility of an infra-red stable non-Fermi liquid ﬁxed point.
The subgap states induced by weak disorder and their
localized nature are discussed in Sec. IV. In Sec. V we
present perturbative one loop calculations for obtain-
ing a qualitative description of the multicritical point
and localization-delocalization transition. We use singu-
lar Riesz potential as the ultraviolet regulator instead of
dimensional regularization. Some scaling properties for
class DIII are discussed in Sec. VI. Finally we summa-
rize our ﬁndings and provide some future directions in
Sec. VII.

II. TOPOLOGY AND MASSLESS DIRAC FIXED

POINT

In this section we consider toy models for topological
states in ﬁve diﬀerent symmetry classes in terms of low
energy massive Dirac fermions. This will set the ground
for clarifying the superuniversality of topological tran-
sitions in clean, gapped systems. We will ﬁrst discuss
the models pertinent to experimentally realized topolog-
ical systems such as superﬂuid 3He-B phase (class DIII)
Bi2Se3 (class AII) . Subsequently we consider the other
three classes, which do not yet have experimental real-
izations.

stant m corresponds to the uniform chemical potential of the
quasiparticles in normal state, and ∆− = ∆45 − ∆4 is a com-
bination of two underlying disorder couplings, ∆4 and ∆45.
For the typical examples of 3He-B ∆45 and ∆4 respectively
correspond to the strengths of random, real s-wave pairing
and a random chemical potential for normal quasiparticles,
while for a diﬀerent physical system they can represent re-
alization of diﬀerent random potentials. The disorder cou-
plings ∆45 and ∆4 are positive deﬁnite quantities, while ∆−
can have both positive and negative values. For d = 3 when
∆− is less than the critical strength ∆∗
−, the direct transition
between TSC and NSC is described by the massless, Dirac
fermion ﬁxed point with a dynamical exponent z = 1 and a
correlation/localization length exponent νM = 1 (anomalous
dimension of Dirac mass). The disorder controlled multicrit-
ical point (projection of a line of ﬁxed point on this plane)
is marked by the black dot, where the diﬀusive phase DIII
DM, TSC and NSC meet. At the multicritical point the
correlation/localization length ξM diverges with an exponent
νM = 2/3 for Gaussian white noise disorder. The correlation
length exponent for disorder (the mean free path of the dif-
fusive metal) ξ∆ diverges with an exponent ν∆. At one loop
level and Gaussian white noise disorder, ν∆ = 1. The dynam-
ical exponent for the localization-delocalization transition is
nonuniversal and depends on the ratio ∆45/∆4.

are four mutually anticommuting Dirac matrices: Γ1 =
−σ3 ⊗ τ1, Γ2 = −σ0 ⊗ τ2, Γ3 = σ1 ⊗ τ1, Γ4 = σ0 ⊗ τ3.
The Pauli matrices σµ and τµ respectively operate on
the spin and particle-hole and indices. Therefore, the
quasiparticles of the gapped B phase are four compo-
nent massive Dirac fermions with a momentum depen-
dent mass mk = −µ + 2k2/(2m). As a deﬁning crite-
rion for class DIII, the Hamiltonian possesses a discrete
particle-hole symmetry {ˆh1, Γ5} = 0, where Γ5 = σ2⊗τ1.
If ψ is an eigenstate of ˆh0(k) with energy E, Γ5ψ is an
eigenstate with energy −E. Due to the reality condi-
tion on the Nambu spinor we cannot multiply Γ5 by

odd powers of momentum.
If we added a term with
Γ5 matrix the resulting p + is paired state will break
time reversal symmetry and belong to class D49. We
also notice that after redeﬁning the Nambu spinor as

be brought into the form of conventional Dirac basis,
where Γj → αj for j = 1, 2, 3 and Γ4 → β, and Γ5 → iβγ5
with γ5 = iα1α2α3.
For classifying topology in class DIII we need to fo-
cus on the SO(4) unit vector ˆn = n/|n|. Inside the BCS
phase sgn(µm) > 0. At k = 0, the four component unit
vector ˆn points along (0, 0, 0,−1), while at k = ∞ it
points along (0, 0, 0, 1). Therefore the spatial inﬁnity has
been identiﬁed and we have compactiﬁed the three di-
mensional Euclidean space onto a three sphere S3. The
SO(4) unit vector has the form of an instanton in the
three Euclidean space, and its topological invariant is ob-
tained from the homotopy Π3(S3) = Z. The topological
invariant is deﬁned by the formula

where the unimodular SU(2) matrix U is deﬁned as

U = (imkσ0 + vk · σ)/|n(k)|.

(5)

(6)

Inside the B phase, the nontrivial topological invariant
is given by N = sgn(v). By contrast, inside the BEC
phase sgn(µm) < 0, and the unit vector points along
(0, 0, 0, 1) both at k = 0 and k = ∞. Consequently, the
instanton proﬁle is absent, and the topological invariant
for the BEC phase vanishes. Consequently, the topolog-
ical distinction between the BEC and BCS states arises
through the sign of the uniform Dirac mass or the chem-
ical potential of the normal quasiparticles. At µ = 0,
a topological quantum phase transition occurs between
these two phases, and the relevant Hamiltonian is

Due to the presence of momentum dependent mass term
k2/(2m)Γ4, the Hamiltonian at the quantum critical
point still possesses the discrete particle-hole symmetry
of class DIII.

B. Class AIII

Following Ref. 10, the low energy Hamiltonian opera-

tor for class AIII can be written as

where the Hamiltonian is block oﬀ-diagonal and we are
using the conventional Dirac matrices αj = σj ⊗ τ1,
β = σ0⊗τ3 and iβγ5 = σ0⊗τ2. The condition of chirality
leads to the discrete particle-hole symmetry {ˆh3, β} = 0.
Due to this condition we cannot allow any identity ma-
trix or a term with β in the Hamiltonian. The topological
invariant is an integer and follows the formula in Eq. (4).
At the topological transition M0 = 0. Notice that after a
suitable unitary transformation the class DIII Hamilto-
nian can also be written in the form announced for class
AIII. However an important diﬀerence between these two
classes is the precise nature of the quasiparticles. While
class DIII involves real or Majorana fermions, class AIII
involves complex fermions. For subsequent notational
clarity we will rewrite the class AIII Hamiltonian as

Γ4 = σ0 ⊗ τ3 and Γ5 = σ3 ⊗ τ1 are ﬁve mutually an-
ticommuting 4 × 4 gamma matrices, and 1 is the 4 × 4
identity matrix.
In contrast to the class DIII Hamil-
tonian, we have a Γ5 matrix with odd powers of mo-
mentum, as well as an identity matrix. Here these
terms are allowed as only the time reversal symmetry
has to be respected and there is no special requirement
of particle-hole symmetry for class AII. The asymmetry
between conduction and valence bands is captured by
(k) = C0 + C1k2
z + C2k2⊥, which does not have any role
in determining the topology. The other band parameters

M (k) = M0 + M1k2

M2. The topologically trivial and nontrivial states can be
understood by keeping the terms up to the quadratic or-
der, and they respectively correspond to sgn(M0Mj) < 0
and sgn(M0Mj) > 0. Consistent with the underlying
rhombohedral crystalline symmetry, the cubic terms pro-
portional to R1 and R2 break the O(2) rotational sym-
metry in kx − ky plane down to a three fold rotational
symmetry. As R2(3k2
x)Γ5 break the discrete par-
ticle hole symmetry deﬁned for class DIII, it produces a

ykx − k3

hexagonal warping in the dispersion relation of the sur-
face states. At the topological quantum phase transition
the uniform Dirac mass M0 vanishes, and the k2 and k3
terms emphasize that the problem still belongs to the
class AII. For simplicity now onwards we will ignore the
(k) term, as it does not aﬀect topological aspects.

Compared to the k-linear terms, the momentum de-
pendent mass term for any class (as well as cubic terms
in class AII) is irrelevant in the renormalization group
sense. Consequently the universal properties at low mo-
mentum for DIII (|k| < 2mv/), AIII (|k| < v/B) and
AII are captured by a ﬁxed point Hamiltonian of the four
component massless Dirac fermion
ˆh∗ = vk · Γ.

(12)

Therefore, the ﬁxed point Hamiltonian possesses a con-
tinuous chiral symmetry, i. e., [ˆh∗, Γ4Γ5] = 0. It is the
consequence of the continuous chiral symmetry, that the
ﬁxed point Hamiltonian can be a member of AII, DIII
as well AIII. Hence, a four component massless Dirac
fermion describes a simple example of superuniversal-
ity for the topological phase transition in noninteract-
ing, clean systems. In the similar spirit eight component
massless Dirac fermion describes the topological transi-
tion for classes CI and CII.

At the massless Dirac ﬁxed point the dynamic scal-
ing exponent is given by z = 1. Since the anomalous
dimension of the Dirac mass operator is −1, the correla-
tion length exponent associated with the mass operator
is given by νM = 1. This correlation length controls the
localization length or the penetration depth of the zero
energy surface states. The density of states for a mas-
sive Dirac fermion behaves as ρ(E) ∼ |E|Θ(E2 − µ2),
reﬂecting the existence of a hard spectral gap for µ (cid:54)= 0,
and |µ| > |E|. By using this density of states for cal-
culating free energy density we can infer that the quan-
tum critical fan (as shown in Fig. 2) corresponds to the
region kBT > |µ|, and the singular part of the thermo-
dynamic free energy in this region scales according to
f ∼ T d+1 → T 4. Now we are in a position to investigate
the eﬀects of weak quenched disorder.

III. GENERALIZED HARRIS CRITERION FOR

THE STABILITY OF MASSLESS DIRAC

FERMION

Usually the stability of a clean quantum critical point
is understood in terms of Harris criterion. In a conven-
tional set up of order parameter ﬁeld theory, one consid-
ers the random variation of critical coupling gc. The Har-
ris criterion implies that the clean quantum critical point
is stable against inﬁnitesimally weak disorder when the
correlation length exponent νpure > 2/d, where d is the
spatial dimension. For the marginal case of νpure = 2/d
one cannot make any heuristic statement about the sta-
bility. In the literature often the statement of Chayes-
Chayes-Fisher-Spencer (CCFS) theorem is confused with

5

FIG. 2: (Color Online)Direct quantum phase transition be-
tween topologically distinct localized states. In the absence
of disorder, the topologically distinct states possess sharp
spectral gap which is described by the Dirac mass.
In the
presence of disorder, there is no sharp spectral gap, and the
inverse Dirac mass describes the localization length for the
sub-gap states. Here, x represents an external tuning param-
eter, which is a combination of various disorder couplings.
At the critical strength xc the average Dirac mass vanishes,
and the localization length determined by inverse Dirac mass
diverges. The quantum critical behavior of massless Dirac
fermion is observed for kBT >> |x − xc|zνM , with dynamic
scaling exponent z = 1, and the localization length exponent
νM = 1. This picture is applicable for suﬃciently weak dis-
order. When disorder becomes stronger, the massless Dirac
fermion can undergo a semimetal to metal transition, and
there will be no direct transition between two topologically
distinct localized states. Here, T0 corresponds to a micro-
scopic energy scale, and for example T0 can be the average
mass gap in the absence of disorder.

that of heuristic Harris criterion. The precise statement
of CCFS theorem is that the average correlation length
exponent satisﬁes ¯ν > 2/d at any stable critical point in
the disordered systems. Therefore, CCFS theorem not
only asserts the stability of a clean critical point when
νpure > 2/d, it also implies that the average correlation
length exponent for disorder controlled critical point sat-
isﬁes ¯ν > 2/d. For assessing the stability of massless
Dirac ﬁxed point in the presence of randomly varying
band gap or Dirac mass (mass disorder), we can imme-
diately take over the Harris criterion. As the correlation
length exponent νM = 1 (> 2/3), the massless Dirac
ﬁxed point will be stable in three dimensions against
weak mass disorder. However, we cannot make such a
statement in the presence of any other type of disorder
without generalizing the Harris criterion.

A. Symmetry allowed disorder potentials

Before any further discussion of Harris criterion, we
ﬁrst consider the types of disorder allowed by the sym-
metry classiﬁcation. We begin with class DIII, for which

particles is captured by Vj5(x). We can choose V4(x),

with a = 4, 45, j5, j, and ∆a are the disorder coupling
constants.

For class AIII the disorder potentials have to anticom-
mute with Γ4. Therefore, we expect the disorder Hamil-
tonian for class AIII to be similar to the one for class
DIII, i.e., we just need to exchange Γ4 and Γ5. How-
ever, there is an important diﬀerence. In class AIII we
are dealing with complex fermions instead of real Majo-
rana fermions, and we can allow random vector potentials
for class AIII. The general disorder Hamiltonian has the
form

where V5, V45, Vj and Vj4 respectively denote random
mass, random axial chemical potential, random Abelian
vector potential and a random chiral vector potential.
For class CI and CII we again we have similar models
of particle-hole symmetric disorder but involving eight
component Dirac fermions. Thus in classes DIII, AIII, CI
and CII we are not allowed to consider conventional form
of scalar potential disorder which couples to the number
density Ψ†Ψ of the Dirac fermions. We also note that
class CI (time reversal invariant, spin singlet supercon-
ductor) can admit a nonAbelian SU(2) vector potential
(random spin gauge ﬁeld) in addition to the mass and
axial chemical potential disorders.

By contrast, all time reversal symmetric disorders are
allowed for class AII. As discussed in Ref. 17the most
important disorder operators for class AII are (i) a ran-
dom chemical potential V0(x)χ†1χ, (ii) a random mass
or band gap V4(x)χ†Γ4χ, (iii) a random axial potential

B. Generalized Harris criterion

Under the scale transformation x → xel, τ → τ ezl, the
random potentials and the disorder coupling constants
respectively transform as

Va → Vaelηa =⇒ ∆a → ∆ae(2ηa−d)l

(16)

where ηa is the scaling dimension of the associated
fermion bilinear. The disorder coupling ∆a is a relevant
(irrelevant) perturbation when

It is a spectacular property of the noninteracting Dirac
ﬁxed point that the anomalous dimension of any sym-
metry allowed bilinear Ψ† ˆMaΨ is equal to the dynamical
exponent z = 1. Therefore for the class DIII model,
η4 = η45 = 1, ηj5 = ηj = 0. Therefore, all of the allowed
disorder couplings are irrelevant perturbations, and the
massless Dirac ﬁxed point can survive against suﬃciently
weak disorder. Given that ∆j and ∆j5 are more irrele-
vant than ∆4 and ∆45, in the following discussions we
will mostly focus on the random mass and random axial
potentials for class DIII and AIII problems. For class
AII we also have identical stability criterion. The equal-
ity ηa = 1 for the massless Dirac ﬁxed point also shows
that the eﬀects of disorder can be studied by using a
d = 2 +  expansion.

We can formulate a similar criterion for a more general
disorder distribution function and develop an alternative
method of  expansion. For the Gaussian white noise dis-
tribution, the correlation between the disorder potentials
at diﬀerent spatial points is described by a Dirac delta
function, which is a simple example of tempered distri-
bution. Following the theory of harmonic functions we
can consider a more generalized tempered distribution in
terms of singular Riesz potential50, which as a special
limit reproduces the delta function. The Riesz potential
is deﬁned as

Iα(x) =

2απd/2Γ(α/2)

1

|x|(d−α)

(17)

and its Fourier transform is given by |q|−α.
In terms
of the singular potential Dirac delta distribution can be
regularized as

(18)

Motivated by this we can consider the disorder potentials

solving the Dirac equation for a spherical potential. The
even parity solutions are given by

Therefore at the clean ﬁxed point disorder is a relevant
(irrelevant) perturbation when

2ηa > d − α (2ηa < d − α),

and disorder is a marginal perturbation when α = d −
2ηa = d − 2. For d ≥ 2, we have an alternative regulator
α = d − 2 − , and setting  → d − 2 we can recover
the Gaussian white noise distribution. Later on we will
employ this regulator for obtaining the beta functions of
disorder coupling constants. Even though we have formu-
lated the generalization of Harris criterion by keeping a
quantum critical point (ultraviolet ﬁxed point) in mind,
it is readily applicable for non-Fermi liquid phases de-
scribed by infra-red ﬁxed points, as a non-Fermi liquid
ﬁxed point is characterized in terms of various anomalous
scaling dimensions.

IV. NONPERTURBATIVE RARE EVENTS AND

LOCALIZATION FOR WEAK DISORDER

Before considering the eﬀects of stronger disorder on
the quantum critical behavior,
it is important to ask
about the nonperturbative eﬀects of disorder on the
clean, gapped states and the direct topological quantum
phase transition. The perturbative calculations do sug-
gest that the density of states for any energy below the
average mass gap vanishes for suﬃciently weak disorder.
However, nonperturbative eﬀects due to statistically rare
events (corresponding to large ﬂuctuations) can destroy
such sharp spectral gaps by inducing density of states be-
low the disorder averaged mass gap. Unless these states
are localized, we cannot associate any sharp notion of
topologically distinct insulating states. Therefore, it is
best to consider the massless Dirac ﬁxed point as the
quantum critical point between topologically distinct lo-
calized states. Here we will derive simple formulas for the
low energy density of states and the localization length
for weak particle hole symmetric disorder. For concrete-
ness we will consider class DIII model.
Mathematically, the rare events are accessed by keep-
ing a ﬁxed average mass |µ| with max{kBT, ω, v/L} <
v/ξM . For simplicity we only consider the mass dis-
order. Imagine that a statistically rare event gives rise
to a compact TSC region of linear dimensions R, within
the NSC phase with an average ¯µ < 0. For simplic-
ity, we will consider this region to be a sphere of radius
R. Within this TSC region, the mass disorder poten-
tial satisﬁes ¯µ < V4 < ∞. Due to the change in the
topological invariant, such a domain supports low energy
bound/surface states when E < min{¯µ, ¯µ + V4}. The en-
ergy eigenvalues of such bound states can be obtained by

where the total angular momentum j = l + 1/2, l =
0, 1, .., and m = −j,−j + 1, ..., j − 1, j, while the odd

will take the mass proﬁle to be µ(r) = µ1Θ(R − r) −
µ2Θ(r − R), where µ2 = ¯µ > 0, and 0 < µ1 < ∞. After
1 − E2/(v) and κ2 =
2 − E2/(v), the bound state solutions for r < R are
written in terms of modiﬁed spherical Bessel functions
of the ﬁrst kind, while those in the region r > R are
expressed in terms of modiﬁed Bessel functions of second
kind. For j = l + 1/2, the radial functions are

V. LOCALIZATION-DELOCALIZATION

TRANSITIONS AT STRONGER DISORDER

Let us ﬁrst consider the eﬀects of mass disorder fol-
lowing Gaussian white noise distribution. The anoma-
lous dimension of the mass operator η4 is a complicated
unknown function of the disorder coupling ∆4. Within
the scheme of disorder averaged diagrammatic perturba-
tion theory of Abrikosov-Gorkov-Dzhyaloshinskii, η4 can
be obtained by extracting the ultraviolet divergence of
the fermion self-energy and disorder three point vertices.
These diagrams are shown up to two loop order in Fig. 3.
Notice that we are not dealing with any four point ver-
tex which only arises for studying diﬀusons and cooper-
ons. Therefore beta function for mass disorder coupling
is given by

,

(30)

d∆4
dl

= ∆4[2η4(∆4) − d].

(31)

where c is an eﬀective constant that depends on the na-
ture of the distribution functions. From this estimation
we see that the rare events give rise to a Lifshitz tail in
the average density of states and destroy the hard spec-
tral gap of the NSC and TSC phases. The asymptotic
behavior of the low energy density of states is given by
log(ρ(E)) ∼ −|E|−3, reﬂecting that the density of states
vanishes at zero energy. These weak Griﬃth singularities
do aﬀect the thermodynamic properties inside the local-
ized phase at low temperatures. But, they do not cause
any divergent density of states which is a hallmark of ac-
tivated dynamic scaling. Therefore, these weak Griﬃth
singularities are not expected to destroy the quantum
critical properties of massless Dirac fermions. While in
the above estimation the exponential part is quite ro-
bust, it is diﬃcult to obtain a reliable expression for en-
ergy dependent prefactor, and the prefactor |E|−2 can
be changed quite easily. For example, if we have inte-
grated the expression by taking c ∼ µ2/(2∆4) in the
range |¯µ| < µ < ∞, the prefactor would be modiﬁed to
|E|(d−2) ∼ |E|. This particular power is basically cap-
turing the density of states due to surface bound states
localized on the rare region, while exp(−c(cid:48)|E|−d) part is
accounting for its small probability. These considerations
are not qualitatively modiﬁed by the presence of random
axial chemical potential.

To summarize the nonperturbative rare regions for
particle-hole symmetric disorder cause ﬁnite density of
states below the average mass gap, which however van-
ishes at zero energy. The localization length for the low
energy states is given by inverse of the average Dirac
mass. When the disorder strength is gradually increased,
these bound states become more abundant. Tunneling
between the localized states can ultimately give rise to a
diﬀusive phase with ﬁnite density of states at zero energy.
However this is a diﬃcult problem to tackle analytically.
Hence, in the subsequent sections we will restrict our-
selves with disorder averaged perturbative analysis.

If a nontrivial zero of the beta function exists, then quite
generally it will require η(∆∗
4) = d/2 = 3/2. Since the
localization length exponent νM = 1/η4, any nontriv-
ial zero of the beta function will satisfy νM = 2/d =
2/3, which clearly saturates the bound obtained from
the Chayes-Chayes-Fisher-Spencer theorem. Notice that
the correlation length exponent of disorder is given by
ν−1
∆ = 2∆∗
4η(cid:48)
4), and we cannot make any concrete
statement about it without an explicit calculation.
Now we consider the eﬀects of random axial potential.
Due to the properties [Γj, Γ4Γ5] = 0, {Γj, Γ4} = 0 and
{Γ4, Γ4Γ5} = 0, we can show that η45 = η4. Therefore,
the beta function for axial disorder has the form

4(∆∗

d∆45

dl

= ∆45[2η45(∆45) − d] = ∆45[2η4(∆45) − d]. (32)

Therefore, a nontrivial ﬁxed point of the axial disorder
also gives rise to the relation νM = 2/d = 2/3. For
this reason we anticipate νM = 2/d = 2/3 to be valid
for a generic combination of disorder within class DIII.
Similar statements can be made for classes AIII, CI and
CII which can only possess particle-hole symmetric dis-
orders. Now we will perform explicit calculation of the
beta functions at one loop order.

Within the replica method of disorder averaging pro-
cedure we obtain four fermi interactions. We consider
the general probability distribution regularized in terms
of Riesz potential and control the ultra-violet divergence
of Feynmann diagrams through α = (d−2)− expansion.
The quartic interaction terms acquire the form

crossing diagrams similar to those in Fig. 4 generate four
fermion interaction (absent at the bare level). However
in the presence of a dynamic propagator (rather than a
constant) for the bosonic ﬁeld (analogous to our disor-
der propagator) these diagrams become ultraviolet con-
vergent within d = 4 −  expansion scheme and do not
contribute to the beta functions. Notice that the ladder
and crossing type of diagrams do behave as log Λ in d = 2
dimensions and contribute to the beta functions. To sum-
marize when the four fermion interaction obtained within
the replica formalism is properly regularized it gives rise
to the same beta functions as found from the conventional
diagrammatic perturbation theory of Abrikosov-Gorkov-
Dzhyaloshinskii without replica trick. Now we provide
the explicit forms of one loop beta functions for classes
DIII, AII and AIII.

FIG. 4: (Color Online) A class of diagrams arising for the
four fermion interaction vertex within the replica averaged
calculation. When Dirac delta function of the Gaussian white
noise distribution is treated as a homogeneous tempered dis-
tribution, and regularized in terms of singular Riesz poten-
tial, these Feynmann diagrams become ultraviolet ﬁnite and
do not contribute to the RG ﬂow equations of the disor-
der couplings. Therefore beta function of a disorder vertex
will be determined by anomalous dimension ηa as suggested
by diagrammatic perturbation theory of Abrikosov-Gorkov-
Dzhyaloshinskii. This aspect gets lost when Dirac delta func-
tion is treated at its face value to obtain a local interaction
and the theory is regulated with d = 2 +  expansion.

For class DIII we have two disorder coupling constants
∆4 and ∆45 respectively corresponding to mass and axial
chemical potentials. The one loop RG ﬂow equations for
these couplings are given by

dashed lines respectively denote fermion and disorder propa-
gators. At any given order of perturbation theory, the renor-
malized disorder vertex can be obtained by diﬀerentiating the
self-energy with respect to the appropriate source term as a
consequence of Ward identity. The beta function for disor-
der couplings can be obtained by extracting the ultra-violet
divergence of the self energy and the three-point vertex for
disorder, and it precisely depends on the anomalous dimen-
sion of an appropriate fermion bilinear. For example if we
consider a disorder denoted by VM (x) Ψ† ˆM Ψ, where ˆM is a
4 × 4 matrix, the beta function of the disorder coupling will
be determined by ηM .

those vertex functions which are related to the vertices of
Fig. 3. At the end of the calculation we can set  → (d−2)
for recovering the beta functions of Gaussian white noise
distribution. In the process of perturbative calculation
we also encounter additional four point vertices as shown
in Fig. 4. Within the adopted regularization scheme,
these are ultra-violet convergent diagrams and do not
contribute to the beta functions. For example, consider
a one loop diagram (either ladder or crossing type). Its
ultra-violet behavior is governed by the integral

dq q−d+1+2 →

dq q−d+1,

(35)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

and it is indeed ultra-violet convergent for d > 2. This
property can be demonstrated for higher order diagrams
as well. By contrast a regular vertex correction at one

loop order behaves as(cid:90)

dq q−1+ → log Λ

(36)

and contributes to the beta function for any spatial di-
mension d. This is reminiscent of diagrammatic cal-
culations for Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory (for itinerant
quantum criticality), QED and QCD where ladder and

(41)

for which the localization length exponent is given νM =
1/η4 = 2/(3 − α). Since the Gaussian white noise cor-
responds to α = 0 or  = 1, we ﬁnd νM = 2/3. How-
ever, the dynamical scaling exponent varies continuously
along this line according to z = (3 − α)/2 + 2∆∗
4. On
the other hand, the correlation length exponent for the
disorder coupling is given by ν∆ = 1/ = 1/(1 − α).
Since the fermion ﬁeld has a nontrivial anomalous di-
mension ηΨ = 3/8 + 2∆∗
4, the quasiparticle residue of
massless Dirac fermion vanishes according to δηΨν∆ upon
approaching the disorder controlled ﬁxed point. However
ηΨ, z and ν∆ will generally receive correction from higher
order diagrams.

B. Class AII

For class AII we have four coupling constants ∆1, ∆4,
∆45 and ∆4j. The RG ﬂow equations for these couplings
at one loop order have similar forms as in Eq. (37) and

does not preserve particle hole symmetry. Within the
subspace of scalar and axial chemical potential disorder
the diagrammatic perturbation theory will suggest z =

Gaussian white noise disorder becomes z = 3/2. But
along this line of ﬁxed points the anomalous dimension

approximation. If the transition is tuned by scalar po-
tential disorder the anomalous dimension of Dirac mass
becomes weaker than that for class DIII. The residue of
Dirac fermion also vanishes along this line of ﬁxed points
due to the nontrivial anomalous dimension of the fermion
ﬁeld.

C. Class AIII

For class AIII we have four particle-hole symmetry pre-
serving disorder couplings ∆5, ∆45, ∆A and ∆4j respec-
tively corresponding to Dirac mass, axial chemical po-
tential, random Abelian vector potential and an imag-
inary, random Abelian axial vector potential. The RG
ﬂow equations are determined by using the scaling di-

These equations supports a line of ﬁxed points similar to

dynamic scaling exponent. Therefore, for class AIII and
class DIII models with particle-hole symmetric disorder
we expect νM = 2/3 to be a robust result. We note
that the form of the beta functions evaluated within d =
2 +  expansion scheme are diﬀerent from the ones found
above. But, the line of ﬁxed points extracted here occur
within both schemes of calculation.

VI. SCALING PROPERTIES OF DISORDER

CONTROLLED FIXED POINTS

We consider the scaling properties of physical quanti-
ties as suggested by the one loop RG equations. For sim-
plicity we only discuss class DIII. The scaling behaviors
for other two classes can be derived in a similar man-
ner. The solutions to the ﬂow equations for the disorder
couplings are given by

the bare disorder strength exceeds the critical strength
( ∆−(0) > ∆∗
−), the renormalized disorder couplings di-
verge beyond a scale l∗
∆. Beyond this scale the RG equa-
tions derived for the ballistic Dirac fermions break down,
and the massless Dirac fermion undergoes a quantum
phase transition to the diﬀusive state, characterized by a

ﬁnite density of states at zero energy i. e., ρ(E = 0) (cid:54)= 0.
This scale deﬁnes the diverging correlation length

the quasiparticles inside the diﬀusive phase. The corre-
lation length exponent for disorder has been found to be
ν∆ = 1/. The quasiparticle life-time depends on the
dynamical exponent z∗ = 1 + ∆+(0), and

τ ∼ ξz∗

(55)

and due to the nonuniversality of the dynamical exponent
ν∆z∗ is also nonuniversal. After solving the recursion

(58)
where νM = 2/(3 − α) = 2/(2 + ). The scaling be-
havior of the localization-delocalization transition will be
governed by certain power of the reduced distance from
the phase boundary. Since Dirac mass is a more rele-
vant perturbation than the disorder (for any α > −1/2),
we expect that the scaling phenomena for the localiza-
tion delocalization transition will be mainly governed by
the localization length exponent νM . Inside the diﬀusive
phase, the thermodynamic and transport properties re-
semble those of a diﬀusive Fermi liquid. For example the
speciﬁc heat varies as C ∼ T and the thermal conductiv-
ity at low temperatures is κxx ∼ T . By contrast, the ratio
κxx/(kBT ) will vanish exponentially inside the localized
phase. When the temperature exceeds ξ−z
M , we
are in the critical regime of the localization-delocalization
transition, and κ ∼ T (z+1)/z. For the model with only
random axial chemical potential our calculations show
z−1 = νM = 2/(3 − α). Therefore critical κ ∼ T (5−α)/2.
We note that the physical properties of metallic phase can
alternatively be understood in terms of nonlinear sigma
model by following Ref. 51.

∆ and ξ−z

Finally we comment on the non-Fermi liquid nature of
the multicritical point. If we follow the semimetal-metal
transition from the weak disorder side the quasiparticle
residue of the Dirac fermion vanishes as δηΨν∆ 45. Simi-
larly the residue of the diﬀusons vanishes upon approach-
ing the critical point from the diﬀusive metal according

11

to δν∆z. The inﬂuence of this ﬁxed point can be seen
over a wide range of temperatures45, i.e., in the quantum
critical fan as shown in Fig. 5. We also emphasize that
the multicritical point denotes the maximum strength of
disorder for which a direct transition between two local-
ized states is allowed and the quantum critical fan for this
transition is similar to the one in Fig. 2, but with modi-
ﬁed νM z. For only axial disorder this product will remain
to be unity, and will continuously vary by depending on
the strength of mass disorder.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have considered the eﬀects of quenched disorder
on three dimensional, gapped topological states. The
direct quantum phase transitions between topologically
distinct states for all ﬁve symmetry classes are governed
by massless Dirac fermion ﬁxed point with emergent chi-
ral symmetry. This is a spectacular example of superuni-
versality and based on both perturbative and nonpertur-
bative calculations we have argued for its stability against
disorder. At the perturbative level, we have established
a generalized Harris criterion which can be applied for
all types of disorder. As the scaling dimension of all
fermion bilinears at the massless Dirac ﬁxed point satis-
ﬁes η < d/2 = 3/2, the superuniversality remains robust
for suﬃciently weak disorder. By considering nonper-
turbative rare events for weak particle-hole symmetric
disorder, we have found that the disorder induced Lif-
shitz tail destroys a sharp spectral gap, but the density of
states varies as − log ρ(E) ∼ |E|−3 and it vanishes at zero
energy. We have argued that these states are localized
with the localization length being determined by the dis-
order averaged Dirac mass. Therefore the massless Dirac
fermion ﬁxed point controls a direct topological quan-
tum phase transition between two topologically distinct
localized phases, with dynamical exponent z = 1 and
the localization length exponent νM = 1. The renormal-
ization group analysis shows that the superuniversality

DSMCDMQC(cid:68)(cid:45)(cid:68)cTis absent beyond a critical strength of disorder, and for
stronger disorder two localized states are separated by
a delocalized diﬀusive phase. Therefore, the robustness
of superuniversality for weak disorder and its eventual
demise at stronger disorder suggests a similar structure
for the global phase diagram for all ﬁve symmetry classes.
Our calculations can be immediately applied to the
dirty topological states in any dimension d ≥ 3. The
density of states due to the Lifshitz tail are expected to
vary as − log ρ(E) ∼ |E|−d, and the localization length
exponent for direct transition should be given by νM = 1.
In addition the generalized Harris criterion suggests the
stability of the massless Dirac ﬁxed point for any d ≥ 3
(for white noise distribution). Therefore, the phase dia-
grams of dirty topological states for all symmetry classes
in any dimension d ≥ 3 should be similar, with the folow-
ing features: at weak disorder a direct transition between
topologically distinct localized states controlled by mass-
less Dirac fermion, which eventually gives away to a diﬀu-
sive metal for suﬃciently strong disorder. Some interest-
ing examples are four dimensional quantum Hall plateau
transition, and the transition between four dimensional
class AII topological and trivial insulators (Z invariant).
Apart from describing the stability of fermionic quantum
critical points, the generalized Harris criterion described
here can also be employed for addressing the stability of
non-Fermi liquid phases.

Our work should stimulate nonperturbative analytical
and numerical analysis of the topological quantum phase
transitions for diﬀerent symmetry classes for d ≥ 3. On
the experimental side, there are some data for topolog-

12

ical insulator to trivial insulator transition for spin or-
bit coupled materials. However due to the presence of a
metallic bulk it is hard to obtain reliable information re-
garding the massless Dirac fermion nature of the critical
point. We anticipate that some of our predictions regard-
ing class DIII can be tested for 3He B phase on porous
vycor and aerogel. The pseudoscalar pairing of the four
component charged Dirac fermions52 is also experimen-
tally pertinent example of TSC in the class DIII. Upon
projection onto the low energy quasiparticles in the vicin-
ity of the Fermi surface, the eﬀective Hamiltonian for
pseudoscalar pairing maps onto the eﬀective Hamiltonian
of B-phase53. Following the suggestion of Ref. 52, there
has been experimental interest in the superconducting
CuxBi2Se3 and Sn1−xInxTe54–63. The actual topological
nature of the paired state in this material is still under
debate. However recent NMR experiments have provided
evidence for triplet pairing, with the d vector locked in
the ab plane. The state can still be topological65, but it
is not the pseudoscalar pairing of Dirac fermions. Since
these materials are quite dirty, disorder eﬀects can be im-
portant for determining the actual nature of the paired
state.
