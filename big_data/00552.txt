ABSTRACT
We present the results of a joint Swift-NuSTAR spectroscopy campaign on M31. We
focus on the ﬁve brightest globular cluster X-ray sources in our ﬁelds. Two of these
had previously been argued to be black hole candidates on the basis of apparent hard-
state spectra at luminosities above those for which neutron stars are in hard states.
We show that these two sources are likely to be Z-sources (i.e. low magnetic ﬁeld
neutron stars accreting near their Eddington limits), or perhaps bright atoll sources
(low magnetic ﬁeld neutron stars which are just a bit fainter than this level) on the
basis of simultaneous Swift and NuSTAR spectra which cover a broader range of
energies. These new observations reveal spectral curvature above 6-8 keV that would
be hard to detect without the broader energy coverage the NuSTAR data provide
relative to Chandra and XMM-Newton. We show that the other three sources are also
likely to be bright neutron star X-ray binaries, rather than black hole X-ray binaries.
We discuss why it should already have been realized that it was unlikely that these
objects were black holes on the basis of their being persistent sources, and we re-
examine past work which suggested that tidal capture products would be persistently
bright X-ray emitters. We discuss how this problem is likely due to neglecting disk
winds in older work that predict which systems will be persistent and which will be
transient.

1 INTRODUCTION

It has long been known that there are more X-ray binaries
per unit stellar mass in globular clusters than in ﬁeld stellar

2 Maccarone et al.

populations (Clark 1975). The process by which X-ray bina-
ries form in globular clusters is diﬀerent from X-ray binary
formation processes in low density ﬁeld star populations. In
globular clusters, close binaries are formed through inter-
actions between stars, be they tidal captures (Fabian et al.
1975), exchange encounters (Hills 1976), or direct collisions
(Verbunt & Hut 1987). As a result, the orbital period dis-
tributions of the systems may be quite diﬀerent from one
another.

Whether black holes exist in globular clusters is a topic
of great importance for understanding the dynamical evolu-
tion of clusters (e.g. Sippel & Hurley 2013; Heggie & Giersz
2014; Morscher et al. 2015), and the formation of gravi-
tational wave sources. Black holes in globular clusters are
likely to have a diﬀerent mass distribution than those in
ﬁeld X-ray binaries, extending up to higher masses , because
the black holes in ﬁeld X-ray binaries form predominantly
through common envelope evolution (e.g. van den Heuvel
1983), while the black holes in cluster X-ray binaries may
have formed in from single stars, or wide binary progenitors,
and then entered binaries through tidal capture (Fabian et
al. 1975) or exchange interactions (Hills 1976).. One can
compare, for example, the expected distribution of black
hole masses from single star evolution (Fryer & Kalogera
2001) with the observed distribution from X-ray binaries
( ¨Ozel et al. 2010; Farr et al. 2011). The observed black holes
are lighter than the distribution predicted in the case of sin-
gle star evolution, lending credence to the idea that common
envelopes lead to lower black hole masses. There have also
been suggestions that heavier black holes may also form at
low metallicity (e.g. Linden et al. 2010; Mapelli et al. 2010),
and many globular clusters are signiﬁcantly more metal poor
than the typical star in the Galactic ﬁeld. The overall level
of X-ray emission, and the luminosities of the brightest in-
dividual X-ray sources are highest in the most metal poor
star forming galaxies (Basu-Zych et al. 2013; Brorby et al.
2014) indicating that the metallicity must aﬀect either the
masses of the compact objects, or the number of close bina-
ries with compact objects. These claims had also appeared
to be supported by the reports of ∼ 30M(cid:12) black holes in
two low metallicty galaxies, in the binaries IC 10 X-1 and
NGC 300 X-1 (Prestwich et al. 2007; Crowther et al. 2010).
The mass estimates for both of these objects have recently
been called into question because the phasing of the X-ray
eclipses relative to the radial velocity curves indicate that
the radial velocity curves are not tracing the orbits of the
donor stars (Laycock et al. 2015a,b; Binder et al. 2015).

There are a few more reasons why identifying stellar
mass black hole X-ray binaries in globular clusters is of ma-
jor astrophysical importance. These objects are unlikely to
survive in the same globular clusters that contain intermedi-
ate mass black holes (Leigh et al. 2014); instead, dynamical
friction should cause them to sink to the center of the clus-
ter, where the IMBH will split the binaries. Additionally,
stellar mass black holes in globular clusters represent an ex-
treme case that can be used to test theories of space-times
with more than 4 dimensions in which Hawking radiation
might be far more eﬃcient than in a spacetime described
by standard general relativity (Emparan et al. 2002; Psaltis
2007); globular clusters give excellent “clocks” for proving
that the black hole in question is quite old, so stellar mass

black holes in globular clusters give the strongest available
constraints on this problem (Gnedin et al. 2009).

It has been suggested that the black hole X-ray bina-
ries that form via tidal capture should be persistent X-
ray sources, while those that form via exchange interac-
tions might be predominantly transient sources (Kalogera
et al. 2004). We deﬁne the boundary between persistent
and transient sources here to be sources which are unaf-
fected and aﬀected, respectively, by the ionization instabil-
ity in their accretion disks – i.e. persistent sources accrete
rapidly enough that their outer accretion disks are ionized
at all times, while transient sources are sources which have
low enough accretion rates that they spend most of their
times in states where the outer disk is neutral, and hence
they are subject to this instability (e.g. Cannizzo, Wheeler
& Ghosh 1985; Cannizzo, Chen & Livio 1995; King et al.
1996). In practice, this should be associated with variations
of a factor of ∼ 104 or more in luminosity, but given the
long outbursts of sources with long orbital periods (see e.g.
Truss & Done 2006), there may be objects which appear
to be persistent over the lifetime of X-ray astronomy, but
which are undergoing such outburst cycles. The basis for
the suggestion that tidal capture sources would be persis-
tent comes from King et al. (1996), where it was shown
that black hole X-ray binaries with orbital periods of a few
to ten hours would typically have mass transfer rates that
would make them persistent sources. Barnard et al. (2008)
use this as part of the argument for why it is reasonable to
ﬁnd many persistent objects at luminosities of 1038 erg/sec
in M31 globular clusters, and to associate them with black
hole accretors. On the other hand persistent black holes are
not seen in substantial numbers in the Galactic ﬁeld popu-
lations. The known black hole X-ray binaries in this period
range are predominantly transient sources – only one strong
candidate black hole X-ray binary with a low mass donor
star is persistent – 4U 1957+11 (Gomez et al. 2015) – and
even that object is not a dynamically conﬁrmed black hole.
For quite some time, it was thought that globular clus-
ters would not contain stellar mass black holes in substantial
numbers. Spitzer (1969) had shown that dynamical decou-
pling would result based on a criterion involving a critical
combination of the fraction of the cluster’s mass, and the
ratio of the masses of the heavy objects to the masses of the
light objects. This criterion would be satisﬁed for black holes
in most old star clusters. This then leads to a combination of
eﬀects that should eject a large numbers of the black holes
– dynamical evaporation and ejection in three body encoun-
ters being the two most important (Kulkarni et al. 1993; Sig-
urdsson & Hernquist 1993). Additionally, the gravitational
radiation rocket eﬀect (Redmount & Rees 1975) could also
eject a large fraction of any black holes that merge.

Additional discussion, both in the 1970’s and in the past
15 years, has concerned the possibility of ﬁnding intermedi-
ate mass black holes in globular clusters. In recent years,
searches have been partially motivated by placing globular
clusters on the MBH − σ relation for galaxies (Gebhardt et
al. 2000;Ferrarese & Merritt 2000) and ﬁnding that, if the
nature of the systems is the same, they should host interme-
diate mass black holes; and partly by numerical calculations
that suggest that either mergers of stellar mass black holes
(Miller & Hamilton 2002) or mergers of massive stars (Porte-
gies Zwart & McMillan 2002) could lead to the production of

intermediate mass black holes in globular clusters. Concrete
observational evidence has continued to be lacking. Dynami-
cal studies have, in some cases, shown evidence for increasing
mass-to-light ratios in the centers of globular clusters (e.g.
Newell et al. 1975; Gerssen et al. 2002; Noyola et al. 2008).
Dynamics theory has argued that mass segregation should
place an excess of stellar remnants in the centers of globular
clusters (Illingworth & King 1976; Baumgardt et al. 2003).
Proper motion studies of Omega Cen to date have not shown
a need for an intermediate mass black hole (van der Marel &
Anderson 2010; Watkins et al. 2013). Searches for accretion
signatures, both in X-rays (Grindlay et al. 2001; Haggard et
al. 2013) and in radio (e.g. Maccarone 2004; Strader et al.
2012a) have yielded only upper limits, which in some cases
are below the estimates from dynamical studies.

On the other hand, over the past decade, the evi-
dence for globular clusters with stellar mass black holes has
mounted. The ﬁrst evidence was seen from extremely bright,
strongly variable sources in galaxies within 20 Mpc (Mac-
carone et al. 2007; Brassington et al. 2008), followed by ob-
servations of “ultrasoft” spectra (White & Marshall 1984)
from moderately variable sources in NGC 4472 (Maccarone
et al. 2011). More recently, ﬂat spectrum radio sources have
been detected in the cores of many Milky Way clusters at
luminosities in excess of what is expected from neutron star
X-ray binaries (Strader et al. 2012b; Chomiuk et al. 2013).
In this paper, we use joint Swift-NuSTAR spectra of
several bright X-ray sources in M31 globular clusters to
help determine whether they are accreting black holes or
accreting neutron stars. The sources are selected on the ba-
sis of being bright globular cluster X-ray sources which are
in our NuSTAR ﬁelds and are suﬃciently isolated as to al-
low straightforward spectroscopy. Two of these have already
been claimed to be globular cluster black holes (Barnard et
al. 2011) on the basis of ﬁts to spectra taken by Chandra
and XMM-Newton. In this paper, we ﬁnd that the spectra
of both of those sources, as well as those of two other bright
globular cluster X-ray sources in M31, are much better ﬁt by
models typically used to ﬁt the spectra of neutron stars than
models typically used to ﬁt the spectra of black holes. We
also discuss in this paper possible reasons why the prediction
made in Kalogera et al. (2004) that tidal capture products
should be persistent sources is at odds with observations of
other Galactic black hole X-ray binaries in a similar orbital
period range.

2 SPECTRAL STATE PHENOMENOLOGY

Accreting compact objects typically show a few key spec-
tral states in which substantial amounts of time are spent.
Historically the nomenclature for these sources has been dif-
ferent for black holes and neutron stars, but in recent years,
terminology has begun to converge for the lower luminosity,
more stable source states.

The ﬁrst indications of spectral state dichotomy were
discovered by Tananbaum et al. (1972), who found,
in
Cygnus X-1, that the radio emission turned oﬀ as the X-ray
spectrum went from being dominated by hard X-rays to be-
ing dominated by soft X-rays. Hard states are well modelled
by thermal Comptonization in an optically thin, geometri-
cally thick hot ﬂow (Thorne & Price 1975). These states are

always seen at low luminosities (in the “low/hard states”,
typically seen below 2% of the Eddington limit – Maccarone
2003), and are often seen at higher luminosities at the starts
of transient outbursts, due to a hysteresis eﬀect seen in black
holes (Miyamoto et al. 1995) and found to show analogous
behavior in neutron stars (Maccarone & Coppi 2003) and
even in accreting white dwarfs (Wheatley et al. 2003). In
the accreting neutron stars, it was once common to refer to
such states as island states, following Hasinger & van der
Klis (1989), but in recent years, the term “hard state” has
been applied to both black hole and neutron star accretion
ﬂows.

X-ray binaries also often exhibit states well explained
by standard accretion disk models (e.g. Shakura & Sunayev
1973; Davis et al. 2005), in which the emission is ther-
mal with gravitational energy release balanced by radiation.
These states are dominated by soft X-rays, and are often
called soft states. Neutron stars with similar accretion rates
will typically show more complicated spectra, presumably
because there is emission from both the accretion disk and
the boundary layer (i.e. the region near the surface of the
star where the excess rotational energy of the inﬂow is dis-
sipated) – see e.g. White & Marshall (1984). With high
signal-to-noise ratio, it is often necessary to use two compo-
nents to model “soft state” neutron star spectra. The spec-
tra of neutron stars in such states tend to peak at higher
temperatures than the spectra of black holes, but they still
show strong curvature above 10 keV, rather than power law
spectra, and the diﬀerence in temperature is likely to be due
primarily to the M−1/4 temperature dependence for accre-
tion disks at a constant Eddington fraction which extend in
to the innermost stable circular orbit.

Bright neutron stars often behave as “Z-sources”, so
named because as they vary, they evolve through a colour-
colour diagram along a path that is shaped roughly like the
letter “Z” (Hasinger & van der Klis 1989). The spectral
shapes for these sources are not much diﬀerent from those of
the soft state sources. They can generally be well-modelled
by low temperature, moderate optical depth thermal Comp-
tonization models when the count rates are low, and often re-
quire two quasi-thermal components when observed at high
signal-to-noise ratio. The brightest atoll sources – i.e. the
brightest “soft state” neutron stars – have spectra that are
quite diﬃcult to distinguish from the Z-source spectra (e.g.
Di Salvo et al. 2002; Gierli´nski & Done 2002), and there
is even one source, XTE J1701-462, which transitions be-
tween the atoll and Z behaviours, but which does not show
any dramatic diﬀerence between Z-source aand bright atoll
source spectra (Lin, Remillard & Homan 2009) . The Z-
sources are generally a bit more strongly variable than the
brightest atoll sources (e.g. van der Klis 1995), but this dis-
tinction is not something of which we can take advantage
when working with sources in M31 due to the relatively low
count rates.

Extremely bright black hole accretion disks, as well
as black hole accretion disks observed during the transi-
tion between the hard state and the soft state, show dif-
ferent modes of behavior (Miyamoto et al. 1991; Homan et
al. 2001). The brightest accretors probably have radiation
pressure-dominated disks (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), and
can be moderately well modelled as steep power laws and
are sometimes called steep power law states (McClintock &

4 Maccarone et al.

Remillard 2006). These states are relatively uncommon and
short-lived in most systems. They are seen fairly often in
GRS 1915+105, but that object is typically near the Ed-
dington limit, and on the basis of its luminosity alone, it
would be classiﬁed as a black hole without much debate,
now that its distance is well established (Reid et al. 2014).1

3 OBSERVATIONS

We make use of data sets obtained from Swift and NuSTAR.
Both the NuSTAR data and the Swift data have been ex-
tracted with 45” apertures around the already-known source
positions (Galetti et al. 2004; Peacock et al. 2010). The
names, positions and magnitudes of the clusters are given
in Table 2. There do exist higher signal-to-noise archival
XMM and Chandra data for these sources, but we prefer
the quasi-simultaneous Swift data over the Chandra/XMM
data, because the systematic uncertainties that may be in-
duced due to source variability are hard to quantify and
likely are more important than the increased statistical er-
rors from the Swift data. The data are grouped to a min-
imum of 1 count per bin to avoid some poorly understood
statistical problems. In the plots, further rebinning is done
to help make the ﬁgures clearer, but these binnings are not
used for spectral ﬁtting. Source-free background regions
near the sources are used for creating background spectra
for both instruments, and response matrices are generated
with the standard tools for both satellites. For NuSTAR,
FMPA and FMPB data are combined, and an averaged re-
sponse matrix is produced.

We have three NuSTAR observations which were used

for this project. These are listed in Table 1.

4 CLASSIFICATION OF COMPACT OBJECT

CLASS BASED ON X-RAY DATA

The gold standard for identifying black holes has tradition-
ally been demonstration that the mass of the accretor ex-
cedes the maximum mass for a neutron star under equations
of state allowed by both general relativity and laboratory ex-
periments on dense matter (Kalogera & Baym 1996). The
masses are typically estimated using a combination of ra-
dial velocity curves, and some estimate of the binary in-
clination angle (McClintock & Remillard 1986; Casares &
Jonker 2014). In many cases, however, the distance, extinc-
tion and/or crowding make it diﬃcult or impossible to make

1 There is now an ultraluminous X-ray source, M82 X-2, which
has been established to have a neutron star primary on the basis
of pulsations (Bachetti et al. 2014). This source shows a spectrum
harder than that which is seem from black hole candidates at sim-
ilar luminosities, and shows pulsations, both of which distinguish
it from bright black hole X-ray binaries fairly clearly. Its existence
does suggest more caution on characterising sources solely based
on luminosity, but it is quite phenomenologically diﬀerent from
black holes accreting above the neutron star Eddington limit, and
the magnetic collimation that causes the pulsations to appear also
probably allows the apparent luminosity from M82 X-2 to exceed
the Eddington limit by such a large factor.

a measurement of an object’s radial velocity curve. Addi-
tionally, some sources are persistently bright, making it im-
possible to estimate their inclination angles from ellipsoidal
modulations.

A variety of tests exists for showing that an accreting
object is a neutron star rather than a black hole. The two
most prominent are detection of pulsations (Giacconi et al.
1971) and detection of Type I X-ray bursts (ﬁrst seen by
Grindlay et al. 1976, but ﬁrst associated with thermonu-
clear fusion on a neutron star by Maraschi & Cavaliere 1977
– see also Woosley & Taam 1976). These phenomena can be
used for nearby sources in crowded or reddened regions, but
typically do not provide suﬃciently strong signals to be de-
tected in extragalactic binaries, even in M31. Additionally,
the absence of bursts or pulsations is rather diﬃcult to use
as strong evidence in favor of a black hole. There may be
accretion regimes in which Type I bursts would be expected
if the object is a neutron star (e.g. Remillard et al. 2006)
such that strong indirect evidence would be provided.

At the same time, a phenomenology exists for demon-
strating that an object is a black hole rather than a neutron
star, given more and better X-ray data. The origins of the
ideas used date back to the 1980’s, and have been ﬂeshed
out to the extent that they have reached fairly wide accep-
tance, if not a total consensus. White & Marshall (1984)
suggested that the presence of an ultrasoft component in a
spectrum could be an indicator of a black hole rather than
neutron star accretor. This suggestion has stood up well
over time. Gradually, it has been found that high/soft state
black holes are well modelled by a series of optically thick
annuli with temperatures that decrease outwards. The disk
blackbody model (diskbb in XSPEC – Mitsuda et al. 1984)
provides an excellent phenomenological description of the
data. There do exist more models which treat the radiative
transfer and relativistic eﬀects in the disk in greater detail
(e.g. Davis et al. 2005) and have been used to estimate the
inner disk radii in order to make estimates of the spin of ac-
creting black holes (Zhang et al. 1997 for an early attempt;
Shafee et al. 2006). The newer disk models provide much
more precise parameter estimation, but typically do not ﬁt
the data any better, and for the purposes of this paper, in
which we merely aim to classify the type of source spectrum,
the higher level of complication in using such models is not
justiﬁed.

The spectra of neutron stars are considerably more
complex, and there is less consensus about the correct
models for describing the real physics of the systems (see
e.g. White et al. 1988; Mitsuda et al. 1989; Church &
Baluci´nska-Church 1995). In this paper we will use a sim-
ple thermal Comptonization model within XSPEC (comptt
– Titarchuk 1994). This model has been shown to provide
good spectral ﬁts to bright accreting neutron stars in the
past (e.g. Lavagetto et al. 2008).2 These sources typically
ﬁt to relatively high optical depths (τ ∼ 10) and low tem-

2 We are not particularly concerned with extracting detailed in-
formation about the spectra of the sources studied in this paper,
given that Galactic and Magellanic Cloud sources will be better
for that purpose. We are primarily interested in understanding
which sources are black holes and which are neutron stars. We
are thus concerned only about classiﬁcation and hence choose a
model with relatively few free parameters and which can param-

perature Comptonization (kBT ∼ 3 keV) models, with low
temperature seed photon distributions.

Additionally, state transitions from soft states to hard
states occur at a fairly uniform 2% of the Eddington lumi-
nosity (Maccarone 2003; Kalemci et al. 2013).3 Thus, if a
distance to a source is known, the state transition luminos-
ity can be used as an estimator of the compact object mass,
which is suﬃcient to distinguish between neutron stars of
≈ 1.4 − 2.0M(cid:12) and black holes of 5 − 10M(cid:12). Some hystere-
sis eﬀects are seen in black hole systems (Miyamoto et al.
1995) which are generally quite similar to those seen in neu-
tron star systems (Maccarone & Coppi 2003), but the high
luminosity hysteretic hard states are generally quite short
lived, and so are improbable to catch in a single snapshot,
and can be ruled out with monitoring observations. Based
on an earlier understanding of black hole/neutron star phe-
nomenology, Barret et al. (1996) proposed that observing a
source to have a hard X-ray (i.e. >20 keV) luminosity above
1037 erg/sec was evidence that a source is a black hole.

Single epoch X-ray spectroscopy can often separate out
black holes from neutron stars, as well. In low/hard states,
the spectra can often be quite diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate from
one another, but neutron stars often show cutoﬀs at some-
what lower energies than do black holes. In softer states,
the diﬀerences are much more pronounced. The neutron
stars have two quasi-thermal components – the disk and
the boundary layer – while black holes have only a disk.
Additionally, the characteristic temperatures of the neutron
stars’ disks are higher than those of the black holes because
of the M−1/4 scaling of inner disk temperatures. The combi-
nation of these factors makes the neutron stars have harder
spectra in their soft states than do soft state black holes.

eterize the data well, rather than a model which is physically
well-motivated.
3 Dunn et al. (2010) suggested that there was as much spread
in the soft-to-hard state transition luminosities as in the hard-
to-soft state transition luminosities, but those claims were based
entirely on including a set of objects without known black hole
masses or distances, and assuming them to be at distances of
5 kpc (closer than the Galactic Center distance), and to have
masses of 10 M(cid:12) (larger than the typical 8 M(cid:12) value for other
stellar mass black holes from ¨Ozel et al. 2010; Farr et al. 2011)
The combination of these assumption systematically drives down
the state transition luminosities for the poorly studied sources,
creating a substantial amount of scatter which does not exist for
the well-studied sources.

5 AN INTRODUCTION TO OUR

STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY

We use some methodology for ﬁtting and testing the spec-
tral models which is non-standard for X-ray spectroscopy,
but which have been used widely in other contexts, and is
well-developed. We use the cstat option within XSPEC
12.8, following Cash (1979). This statistic returns a likeli-
hood function which is maximized for the best ﬁtting value
for a particular model, but does not yield, in a straightfor-
ward manner, a goodness of ﬁt. We use the Swift data from
0.5-6.0 keV and the NuSTAR date from 4-20 keV. These
bands are chosen because they are well-calibrated and have
high ratios of source to background photons for the sources
we study here. All source ﬂuxes are reported by taking the
unabsorbed model and integrating between 0.5 and 20 keV.
We then note that the most likely problem with a ﬁt
is that the curvature of the spectral model will be diﬀer-
ent from the curvature of the data. This will lead to maxi-
mal diﬀerences between cumulative number of counts in the
data and the model, folded through the response matrix,
at the edges of the distribution. Such a diﬀerence between
data and model is identiﬁed most readily in an Anderson-
Darling (1954) test. XSPEC has a routine for computing
the Anderson-Darling parameter as a test statistic, which we
use. We can then use the Monte Carlo goodness command
in XSPEC to estimate the null hypothesis probability, by
running a set of simulations and determining how often the
simulations give ﬁts with a better Anderson-Darling statistic
than the model. We use 10000 simulations with the good-
ness command to estimate the null hypothesis probabilities.
We note that we rely on ﬁts to time-integrated spectra
for this work, rather than examining the source variability.
In principle, the source variability could provide very strong
constraints on the nature of the sources, but the number of
counts here is insuﬃcient for such an analysis. E.g., we have
approximately 15% statistical uncertainties on hardness ra-
tios between 6-10 keV and 10-20 keV in integrations with
about 100 ksec of good time, while Smale et al. (2003) show
that the deviations from the mean in that pair of bands is
about 25%; we thus do not have the data quality we need
to see if the colors follow a Z-track for the sources.

6 INDIVIDUAL SOURCES

For all sources for which we have good NuSTAR spectra, we
attempt to ﬁt three diﬀerent spectral models: a power law,
a disk blackbody, and a Comptonized blackbody (comptt).
In nearly every case, we consider absorption with the Galac-

tic value, and absorption which may ﬂoat freely; when a
statistically acceptable ﬁt is given without allowing the ab-
sorption to ﬂoat freely, we know already that the model can-
not be rejected, and we do not consider further the variable
absorption case. Given the low redshift of M31, we do not
treat Galactic absorption and intrinsic absorption as sepa-
rate components, but rather treat them as a single compo-
nent with a summed absorption column. We take the Galac-
tic absorption to the M31 ﬁelds to be 1021 cm−2 (Kaberla et
al. 2005). The results of the diﬀerent spectral ﬁts are given
in Table 3.

6.1 Bo 153

Bo 153 was suggested by Barnard et al. (2011) to be a strong
candidate for being a globular cluster black hole on the ba-
sis of appearing to ﬁt well to a low/hard state spectrum
while being at a luminosity (varying in the range from 0.8–
2.4×1038erg/sec
in the 0.3–10.0 keV band) above which
neutron stars do not show low hard states. With NuS-
TAR, the single power law model gives an unacceptable ﬁt
– clearly the data show more curvature than a single power
law allows. disk blackbody model with free temperature and
column density produces a ﬁt which is marginally statisti-
cally acceptable, but which requires an unphysically small
inner disk radius (i.e. much less than a Schwarzschild ra-
dius), unphysically large temperatures (i.e. > 2 keV), and
no Galactic column density. When the model is forced to
have an inner disc radius of 30 km, the ﬁt is no longer statis-
tically acceptable. The comptt model provides a ﬁt which
is statistically acceptable, and which has parameters in line
with typical Z sources and typical bright atoll sources. The
ﬂux from the comptt model, correcting for absorption, is
1.7 × 10−12 erg/sec/cm2, corresponding to a luminosity of
1.2 × 1038 erg/sec for a distance of 784 kpc (Stanek & Gar-
navich 1998), which is also a typical value for a Z source.
Figures are presented for the power law ﬁt – Figure 1, the
disk blackbody ﬁt – Figure 2, and the thermal Comptoniza-
tion model ﬁt – Figure 3. These ﬁgures are representative of
the results for all the sources, so we do not present ﬁgures
for the ﬁts to the other sources.

6.2 Bo 185

The results for this source are quite similar to those for
Bo 153. This source was also claimed by Barnard et al.
(2011) to be a strong globular cluster black hole candidate
on the ground of being a bright hard state object. Like for
Bo 153, we ﬁnd that the power law model ﬁts are not sta-
tistically acceptable, and that the statistically acceptable
disk blackbody model ﬁts have unphysically small inner disk

frozen to 1021 cm−2 for Bo 153’s X-ray spectrum. The data are
plotted after rebinning either until a signal to noise of 5 is reached,
or 100 bins have been used, but the input spectra grouped to one
count per bin have been used. From the plot, it is clear that the
data have a greater level of curvature than the model does. The
Swift data, and the model convolved through the Swift response
function are in red while the NuSTAR data and the model con-
volved through NuSTAR’s response function are in black.

radii and unphysically large temperatures. We ﬁnd that the
thermal comptonization model gives a ﬁt that is typical of
Z-sources and bright atoll sources. The ﬂux from the model,
correcting for absorption, is 1.0× 10−12 erg/sec/cm−2, cor-
responding to a luminosity of 7.3 × 1037 erg/sec, which is,
again, typical for Z-sources and bright atoll sources.

6.3 Bo 225

An additional bright X-ray source in M31 is Bo 225. This
object is less well studied than the two previously discussed
sources and has not been claimed in the past to be a black
hole candidate. The only model that ﬁts this source well
is the comptt model. this source, then, we may have run
into the limitations of using such a simple thermal Comp-
tonization model, and the data may be justifying a slightly
high level of complexity. Nonetheless, this model is clearly
the best of the group we have tried. The ﬂux from the un-
absorbed comptt model is 1.3 × 10−12erg/sec/cm−2, cor-
responding to a luminosity of 9 × 1037 erg/sec. The com-
bination of the luminosity of the source, and the fact that
comptt provides both a statistically acceptable ﬁt and rea-
sonable parameter values, indicates that the source can be
conﬁdently identiﬁed as a Z-source or a bright atoll source.

6.4 Bo 375

Bo 375 has also been observed with NuSTAR and Swift.
This is a bright source which has been previously classi-
ﬁed as a neutron star (Barnard et al 2008). For this source,
none of the models with a single continuum component pro-
vides a good ﬁt to the data. The data can be well ﬁt with

a model consisting of a disk blackbody plus a comptonized
blackbody, which is one of the models often used to ﬁt Z-
sources and bright atoll sources (null hypothesis probability
of 0.31) and marginally well-ﬁt by a disk blackbody plus
power law model (null hypothesis probability of 0.03). The
inner disk radius for the disk blackbody plus power law

after rebinning either until a signal to noise of 5 is reached, or 100
bins have been used, but the input spectra grouped to one count

model is unphysically small (12 km), so this model is ad-
ditionally disfavored. The ﬂux from the disk blackbody plus
comptonized blackbody model, correcting for absorption, is
8.1 × 10−12erg/sec/cm−2, corresponding to a luminosity of
6 × 1038 erg/sec for a distance of 784 kpc. This value is
slightly above the Eddington luminosity for a 1.4M(cid:12) neu-
tron star. This value is slightly above the highest luminosity
seen from Sco X-1 of 4.5×1038 erg/sec (Barnard et al. 2003),
which is robust given the geometric parallax distance (Brad-
shaw et al. 1999), but the discrepancy can be explained if
the neutron star in Bo 375 is a bit more massive than the
neutron star in Sco X-1, or if the neutron star in Bo 375 is ac-
creting hydrogen-poor gas. Given that ultracompact X-ray
binaries represent a substantial fraction of the X-ray binaries
in Milky Way globular clusters (Stella et al. 1987; Dieball et
al. 2005; Zurek et al. 2009), this latter interpretation would
not be surprising.

Barnard et al. (2008) had previously found with XMM-
Newton data that a single power law could not ﬁt the spec-
trum of that source, suggesting that it is a neutron star. We
thus favor a neutron star interpretation for the data, as it is
consistent with both our analysis and that of Barnard et al.
(2008).

6.5 SK182C

SK182C is located in the same ﬁeld of view as Bo 375, and
hence is included in the same observations.. This source is
fainter than the others, so our ability to rule out models
is somewhat diminished. For this source, we ﬁnd both the
power law and comptt models to be statistically acceptable
and to have reasonable parameter values.
The ﬂux from the model, correcting for absorption, is
7.6 × 10−13erg/sec/cm−2, corresponding to a luminosity of

data are plotted after rebinning either until a signal to noise of
5 is reached, or 100 bins have been used, but the input spectra
grouped to one count per bin have been used. The model can be
seen to be a good description of the data. The Swift data, and
the model convolved through the Swift response function are in
red while the NuSTAR data and the model convolved through
NuSTAR’s response function are in black. It is clear that the
model not only provides a good statistical ﬁt to the data, but
also matches the curvature of the data.

5 × 1037 erg/sec at the distance to M31. For the spectra
we analyze here, we ﬁnd that either a low hard state black
hole model or a neutron star model could ﬁt well to the data.
The disk blackbody models are all statistically unacceptable.
Given that the source is at about 5% of the Eddington lumi-
nosity for an 8 M(cid:12) black hole, and that black holes at such
a luminosity are usually in soft states unless they are caught
in the rise of a transient outburst (Maccarone 2003; Kalemci
et al. 2013), the black hole interpretation is disfavored for
this source, but not as strongly as for the other sources in
the sample. This source also has no previous identiﬁcation
as either a black hole or a neutron star.

7 DISCUSSION

These results cast doubt on many of the other claims of
globular cluster black holes in M31 globular clusters. Many
of these are based on the same methodology as the claims
for Bo 153 and Bo 185. The results also illustrate the im-
portance of having a broad bandpass, as from NuSTAR, for
making classiﬁcations of black hole and neutron star spec-
tra. In particular, the Z-source/bright atoll source spectral
models can be seen to be relatively similar to power law
spectra, as long as most of the counts are obtained below
about 10 keV where the spectra break sharply. This is, no-
tably, where the responses of Chandra and XMM-Newton
start to become poor.

Some additional support for the neutron star nature
of the sources can come from looking at the Milky Way’s
population of persistent black hole candidates. The only dy-
namically conﬁrmed black hole candidate which is persistent
is Cygnus X-1 (Gies & Bolton 1986; Caballero-Nieves et al.
2009; Orosz et al. 2011), which spends most of its time in

c(cid:13) RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–12

a hard state, but which is likely to be immune from the
full ionization instability due to having a high mass donor
star, and being wind-fed so that the circularization radius
of the disc is smaller than for Roche lobe overﬂow from a
star with the same orbital period (see discussion in Smith et
al. 2002a). Cygnus X-3 represents a similar case, although
its dynamical conﬁrmation is not clear (Szostek & Zdziarski
2008). SS 433 is even less securely a black hole, and is likely
intrinsically super-Eddington but observed edge-on so that
only scattered X-rays are seen (e.g. Charles et al. 2004).
4U 1957+11 is not dynamically conﬁrmed, but appears to
spend most of its time in soft states (Gomez et al. 2015).

There are two other persistent sources, 1E 1740.7-2942
and GRS 1758-258, which appear to be long X-ray periodic-
ities (12.73 and 18.45 days, respectively), and which spend
signiﬁcant fractions of their time in hard states, but these
objects are not dynamically conﬁrmed black holes, they have
unknown donor types (Smith et al. 2002b), and the periods
are signiﬁcantly longer than expected for tidal capture prod-
ucts. The persistent hard state black hole sources with low
mass donors thus may not exist at all, and are clearly, at
most, a small fraction of the total source population bright
enough to be detected with all-sky instruments in the Milky
Way (which is a similar luminosity limit to the luminosity
needed to detect a source at all in M31). There are, of course,
a number of relatively steady quiescent black hole sources,
which might be regarded as persistent hard state sources,
but all of these which are dynamically conﬁrmed as black
holes have undergone large outbursts.

There are selection eﬀects against dynamical conﬁrma-
tion of black holes in persistently bright X-ray binaries.
Nonetheless, there is only one candidate persistent black
hole low mass X-ray binary whose orbital period is short
enough to be in the ∼ 10hrrange where tidal capture might
work, 4U 1957+11. There are many black hole X-ray bi-
naries with both shorter and longer orbital periods which
are transients, and there are no other persistent X-ray emit-
ters whose X-ray emission properties mark them as likely
black hole accretors. As a result, it seems highly unlikely
that black hole X-ray binaries that form from tidal capture
are typically persistent, but it cannot be excluded that this
might occasionally happen.

7.1 Disk winds and the transient problem

One of the original motivations for considering these ob-
jects to be persistent black hole binaries formed by tidal
capture was that such objects had been predicted to exist.
Repeated claims exist in the literature (e.g., Kalogera et al.
2004; Barnard et al. 2009) that tidal capture black hole X-
ray binaries should be persistently X-ray bright. Thus, our
ﬁnding that these objects in M31 are likely neutron stars
gives us good cause to re-consider some of the assumptions
that went into these claims. In particular, it is worth consid-
ering why it may actually be unlikely for a large population
of persistent black hole X-ray binaries to exist, especially in
the orbital period range expected for tidal capture products.
Standard binary evolution and disk instability theory
predicts that systems with orbital periods of about 10 hours,
the range expected from tidal captures, should be persistent
sources (King et al. 1996; Kalogera et al. 2004). However, as
we describe below, this claim is not in line with phenomenol-

c(cid:13) RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–12

M31 globular cluster X-ray sources

ogy of outburst behaviour from black hole X-ray binaries,
and we suggest that mass loss in disk winds can explain the
discrepancy between observation and theory.

Comparison of ﬁgure 1 of King et al. (1996), which
shows the expected mass transfer rates as a function of or-
bital period, and ﬁgure 7 of Lasota (2001), which shows
observed mean accretion rates as a function of orbital pe-
riod indicates a clear discrepancy between the two values.
King et al. (1996) ﬁnd that the typical mass transfer rates
in black hole X-ray binaries in that orbital period range
should be 10−10 − 10−9M(cid:12)/yr, while the recurrence times
of X-ray transients indicate that the mass transfer rates are
more typically a few times 10−11M(cid:12)/yr. Indeed, the dis-
crepancy is already implicitly noted by King et al. (1996)
themselves, who point out that the known low mass X-ray
binaries with black hole primaries are predominantly soft X-
ray transients, rather than persistent emitters. Our ﬁnding
that these persistent sources in M31 are more likely neutron
stars than black holes underscores this point.

A few possible explanations exist for the paucity of per-
sistent black hole emitters. Perhaps the simplest is to invoke
a mechanism that lowers the accretion rate onto the cental
black hole relative to that predicted from the prescriptions
for binary evolution used in King et al. (1996). Two possi-
ble ways to change the mass accretion rates are to change
the mass transfer rates by invoking alternative prescriptions
for magnetic braking, and invoking non-conservative mass
transfer due to disk winds. The now-good agreement be-
tween theory and data for models of evolution of cataclysmic
variables (Knigge et al. 2011) casts doubt on the possibility
that magnetic braking prescriptions are badly ﬂawed, unless
the donor stars in black hole X-ray binaries are considerably
more bloated than those in cataclysmic variables.

Disk winds, on the other hand, show clear evidence of
being present and important in X-ray binaries. If we take,
for example, the best studied quiescent X-ray binary, A0620-
00 we see that it has an orbital period of 7.1 hours, and
a donor mass of 0.4 M(cid:12), meaning that its donor mass is
about 0.6 times as large as that of an unevolved star ﬁlling
its Roche lobe, given the well known relationship between
donor star mass and orbital period for main sequence stars.
This produces a reduction in mass transfer rate by a factor of
about 3.5 – a substantial factor, but not one large enough to
explain the discrepancy between the observed mean outburst
ﬂuence averaged over the best estimate of the source duty
cycle and the predicted mass transfer rates.

Therefore, it appears more likely that disk winds during
the outbursts of black hole X-ray binaries lead to highly
non-conservative mass transfer and hence make the mean
accretion rate by the compact object less than the mass loss
rate by the donor star. Three methods have been used to
estimate the mass loss due to disk winds, and all result in
the ﬁnding that ∼ 90% of the mass lost by the donor star is
also lost by the accretion disk. One method for making the
estimate is the result above, that transient outbursts seem to
have recurrence timescales about 10 times too long, and that
some objects which would be expected to be persistent are,
in fact, transient. Another is that estimates can be made
of the depths of absorption lines seen from the accretion
disks, the opening angles of the disk winds, and the chemical
composition and ionization state of the absorbing gas, and
convert these to mass loss rates in the disk wind (e.g. Neilsen

10 Maccarone et al.

et al. 2011). Additionally, one can estimate the mass transfer
rate from the luminosity of the hot spot where the accretion
stream impacts the outer accretion disk, and compare with
the quiescent X-ray luminosity and with the outburst duty
cycle (e.g. Froning et al. 2011).

Finally, two short-period X-ray binaries have period
derivatives that cannot be well explained in the light of
standard binary evolution scenarioes (Gonzalez Hernandez
et al. 2014). If mass loss is the cause of the latter eﬀect,
then strong mass loss takes place even for quiescent X-ray
binaries. This is at odds with prominent interpretations of
recent ﬁndings that strong X-ray absorption lines are seen
only when sources are in X-ray soft states (Neilsen & Lee
2009; Ponti et al. 2012). On the other hand, if the ionization
state of the wind, rather than the presence of the wind, is
what changes at state transitions, then the claims can be rec-
onciled. Additionally, there are detections of single-peaked
emission lines in GX 339-4 in hard states (Wu et al. 2001),
and single-peaked lines from accretors are often associated
with scatter broadening of lines by disk winds (e.g. Shlos-
man & Vitello 1993; Knigge & Drew 1996 Murray & Chiang
1996; Sim et al. 2010).

All these methods of estimating the actual accretion
rates in black hole X-ray binaries, and the amount of mass
loss in their winds, suggest that mass transfer is in black hole
binaries is highly non-conservative. Systems which would
be persistent can then be forced into quiescent regimes be-
cause the mass loss will reduce the central accretion rates
and reduce the irradiation of the outer disks by the inner
disks; additionally, just the mere loss of mass will reduce
the gas density, and hence the gas temperature in the outer
disks, even in the absence of irradiation. The duty cycles of
bright sources are then suppressed compared to what would
be expected. Importantly, in cataclysmic variables, the mass
loss rates in the wind are very small compared to mass accre-
tion rates by the central white dwarfs (Vitello & Shlosman
1988; Knigge et al. 1995), so disk winds should not be im-
portant for CV evolution. The same may be true for neutron
star accretors. Thus, in hindsight, one should not expect a
substantial population of persistent black hole X-ray bina-
ries, even if the systems are formed by tidal capture, and
persistent sources should be expected to more commonly be
neutron stars, as we have found here.

At the same time, a more detailed treatment of disk
winds would be well-justiﬁed. In this paper, we have dis-
cussed disk winds only in the context of removing mass from
the accretion disk at a constant accretion rate. A more de-
tailed treatment of nonconservative mass transfer would also
consider the angular momentum carried away by the mass
lost from the accretion disk and its subsequent eﬀects on the
mass transfer rate itself. Such a treatment lies beyond the
scope of this paper, but would be well-justiﬁed in light of
recent developments.

8 SUMMARY
We have examined 5 globular cluster sources at LX ∼ 1038
erg/sec in M31 with a combination of data from Swift and
NuSTAR. We have found that in all cases, the data can be
well ﬁtted with high optical depth (τ∼3− 10), low tempera-
ture (kBT < 10) keV comptonization models, while for four

of the ﬁve sources, the data argue strongly against a single
power law model ﬁtting the data, and for all the sources,
the data argue against a multi-temperature blackbody disk
model ﬁtting the data. As a result, we argue that these
sources are all likely to be high accretion rate neutron star
X-ray binaries, although the data are not presently good
enough to determine whether they are “Z-sources” or bright
atoll sources in soft states. Bolstering the idea that these
are neutron stars is the dearth of black hole X-ray binaries.
Because past theoretical work has argued that the accretion
rates expected within a particular range of orbital periods
should yield persistent black hole X-ray binaries, we have
discussed how non-conservative mass transfer due to disc
winds leads to a violation of the assumptions of the past
work.
