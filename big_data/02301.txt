Constructing Reducible Brill-Noether Curves

Eric Larson

Abstract

In [1], it was determined exactly through how many general points a nondegenerate
curve with nonspecial hyperplane section can pass. This gives rise to a method of con-
structing reducible curves C1 ∪Γ C2 → Pr with general nodes: We take a ﬁnite set Γ ⊂ Pr
of general points, and ﬁnd nondegenerate nonspecial curves C1 and C2 in Pr of speciﬁed
degrees and genera which pass through Γ.

The goal of this paper is to show that, subject to certain mild assumptions, curves

constructed in this manner lie in the closure of the locus of curves of general moduli.

Introduction

In the theory of algebraic curves, the technique of degeneration to a reducible curve has enabled
great advances in the understanding of general curves, including the Brill-Noether theorem and
many others [2].

One method to construct reducible curves is to ﬁrst take a ﬁnite set Γ of general points in
Pr, and ﬁnd nondegenerate nonspecial curves fi : Ci → Pr of speciﬁed degrees and genera which
pass through Γ. Results of [1] determine exactly when such curves may be found:

Theorem (Corollary 1.4 of [1]). There exists a nondegenerate nonspecial curve C → Pr of
degree d and genus g in Pr (with d ≥ g + r), passing through n general points, if and only if

((r − 1)n ≤ (r + 1)d − (r − 3)(g − 1)

n ≤ 9

if (d, g, r) /∈ {(5, 2, 3), (7, 2, 5)};
if (d, g, r) ∈ {(5, 2, 3), (7, 2, 5)}.

Remark 1.1. If the general nonspecial curve of degree d and genus g in Pr is degenerate, it is
easy to see it passes through n general points if and only if its linear span does, i.e. if and only
if n ≤ d + 1 − g.

We then pick subsets Γi ⊂ Ci which map injectively under fi onto Γ, and write C1 ∪Γ C2 for
(a choice of) the curve obtained from C1 and C2 by gluing Γ1 to Γ2 via the obvious isomorphism.
The maps fi give rise to a map f : C1 ∪Γ C2 → Pr. Note that even when the fi are immersions of
smooth curves, f could fail to be an immersion (for example if C1 and C2 meet at an additional
point not in Γ). This is the reason why we work with Kontsevich stable maps in this paper,
instead of taking the scheme-theoretic union of C1 and C2.

In this paper, we will show, subject to certain mild constraints, that the curves C1∪ΓC2 → Pr
In

constructed in this manner lie in the closure of the locus of curves of general moduli.
particular, they may therefore be used in the study of the geometry of general curves.

1

More precisely, write M g(Pr, d) for the Kontsevich space which classiﬁes stable maps C → Pr
of degree d, from a nodal curve C of genus g. There is a natural map M g(Pr, d) → M g; we
refer to a curve C → Pr as a Weak Brill-Noether curve (WBN-curve) if it corresponds to a
point in a component of M g(Pr, d) which both dominates M g, and whose generic member is a
map from a smooth curve, which an immersion if r ≥ 3, birational onto its image if r = 2, and
ﬁnite if r = 1; and which is either nonspecial or nondegenerate. In the latter case, we refer to
it as a Brill-Noether curve (BN-curve); in the former case, we refer to it as a limit NonSpecial
curve (NS-curve); and if both cases occur simultaneously, we refer to it as a Nondegenerate
NonSpecial curve (NNS-curve).

The Brill-Noether theorem asserts that BN-curves of degree d and genus g in Pr exist if and

only if the Brill-Noether number

ρ(d, g, r) := (r + 1)d − rg − r(r + 1) ≥ 0;

and that in this case, the locus of BN-curves forms an irreducible component of M g(Pr, d). We
shall also call a curve limit linearly normal if it is a limit of linearly normal curves. Note that
NNS-curves are BN-curves; and a BN-curve in is an NNS-curve (respectively is limit linearly
normal) if and only if d ≥ g + r (respectively d ≤ g + r).
In these terms, our main theorem is:
Theorem 1.2. Let Ci → Pr (for i ∈ {1, 2}) be NNS-curves of degree di and genus gi, which
pass through a set Γ ⊂ Pr of n general points. Suppose either that both curves are limit linearly
normal (equivalently di = gi + r for both i ∈ {1, 2}), or alternatively that for at least one
i ∈ {1, 2} we have

(r + 1)di − (r − 3)(gi − 1) − (r − 1)n ≥(2

4

if di > gi + r;
if di = gi + r.

Then C1 ∪Γ C2 → Pr is a BN-curve, provided it has nonnegative Brill-Noether number.

Note that if both curves pass through n + 1 general points (as opposed to just the n general
points we assumed), then the additional conditions in the above theorem are immediate (for
r ≥ 3). The extra numerical condition is thus quite mild.

Along the way, we shall also prove two other variants on Theorem 1.2, in which the curves are
allowed to be special or degenerate, but which are subject to much more restrictive numerical
inequalities:
Theorem 1.3. Let Ci → Pr (for i ∈ {1, 2}) be WBN-curves of degree di and genus gi, which
pass through a set Γ ⊂ Pr of n general points. Suppose that, for at least one i ∈ {1, 2}, we have

(r + 1)di − rgi + r ≥ rn.

Then C1 ∪Γ C2 → Pr is a WBN-curve.
Theorem 1.4. Let H ⊂ Pr be a hyperplane, and let C → Pr and D → H ֒→ Pr be WBN-
curves, with D lying in H and C transverse to H, which pass through a set Γ ⊂ H of n general
points in H. Suppose that, and that writing d and g for the degree and genus of C, we have

d − rg − 1 ≥ 0 and (r + 1)d − rg + r ≥ rn.

Then C ∪Γ D → Pr is a WBN-curve.

We begin in Section 2 by using results of [5] to establish Theorems 1.3 and 1.4. We then
turn to proving Theorem 1.2 by induction on n; the base cases are provided by Theorem 1.3.
The basic strategy in the proof of Theorem 1.2 is to degenerate one component, say C1 → Pr,
to a union C ′
1 ∪ C2 → Pr, and
then to C ′
1 ) ∪ C2 → Pr is a
BN-curve. Provided this curve lies in a unique component of M g(Pr, d), we may then conclude
that C1 ∪ C2 → Pr is a BN-curve.

1 → Pr. We can then apply induction twice, ﬁrst to C ′′

1 ∪ C2) → Pr, to conclude that C ′

2 WBN-curves and the Restricted Tangent Bundle

Lemma 2.1. Any component of M g,n(Pr, d) whose general member is a WBN-curve is generi-
cally reduced of the expected dimension (r + 1)d − (r − 3)(g − 1) + n.

Proof. Write r′ for the dimension of the linear span of the general member f : C → Pr. Our
component is then birational to a bundle over the Grassmanian Gr(r′, r), whose generic ﬁber
is the component N ⊆ M g,n(Pr′, d) corresponding to BN-curves.

By results of Griﬃths, Harris, and Gieseker [3, 4], the component N is generically reduced

of the expected dimension (r′ + 1)d − (r′ − 3)(g − 1) + n.

If r′ = r this completes the proof. Otherwise, since f is general, it must be linearly normal;
the deﬁnition of WBN-curves then implies d = g + r′, so our component is generically reduced
of dimension

dim Gr(r′, r) + dim N = (r′ + 1)(r − r′) + [(r′ + 1)d − (r′ − 3)(g − 1) + n]

= (d − g + 1)(r − d + g) + (d − g + 1)d − (d − g − 3)(g − 1) + n
= (r + 1)d − (r − 3)(g − 1) + n,

which is the expected dimension.

Lemma 2.2. Let f : C → Pr be a curve, and Γ ⊂ C a (possibly empty) set of points whose
images under f are linearly independent. If f is a general WBN-curve, H 1(f ∗TPr (−Γ)) = 0.
Conversely, if H 1(f ∗TPr (−Γ)) = 0, then f is a WBN-curve.

Proof. First we consider the case when Γ = ∅. By Lemma 2.1, the component of M g(Pr, d)
containing [f ] is smooth at [f ] of the expected dimension. Since this component by deﬁnition
dominates M g, the vertical tangent space H 0(f ∗TPr) of M g(Pr, d) → M g at [f ] is of the expected
dimension χ(f ∗TPr ); thus H 1(f ∗TPr ) = 0.

3

For the converse, H 1(f ∗TPr) = 0 implies the map M g(Pr, d) → M g is smooth at [f ], so [f ]
lies in a component of M g(Pr, d) dominating M g. If f fails to be nondegenerate, then writing
Λ for its linear span, the exact sequence

0 → f ∗TΛ → f ∗TPr → f ∗NΛ ≃ OC(1)codim Λ → 0

implies H 1(OC(1)) = 0.

Finally, we provide an isomorphism H 1(f ∗TPr(−Γ)) ≃ H 1(f ∗TPr ), which reduces the general

case to the case Γ = ∅. For this, we use the exact sequence

0 → f ∗TPr(−Γ) → f ∗TPr → f ∗TPr|Γ ≃ TPr|f (Γ) → 0.

The composition H 0(TPr) → H 0(f ∗TPr) → H 0(TPr|f (Γ)) is surjective (because f (Γ) is a collec-
tion of linearly independent points); consequently the restriction map H 0(f ∗TPr ) → H 0(TPr|f (Γ))
is surjective. Moreover TPr|f (Γ) is punctual, so H 1(TPr|f (Γ)) = 0. The long exact sequence in
cohomology for the above sequence thus gives the desired isomorphism.

Lemma 2.3. Let f : C1 ∪Γ C2 → Pr be a reducible curve, with H 1(f |∗
H 1(f |∗

C2TPr ) = 0. Then f is a WBN-curve.

C1TPr (−Γ)) = 0 and

Proof. Our assumptions imply, via the exact sequence

0 → f |∗

C1TPr (−Γ) → f ∗TPr → f |∗

C2TPr → 0,
that H 1(f ∗TPr ) = 0; consequently, f is a WBN-curve by Lemma 2.2.
Theorem 2.4 (Theorem 1.3). Let fi : Ci → Pr (for i ∈ {1, 2}) be WBN-curves of degree di and
genus gi, which pass through a set Γ ⊂ Pr of n general points. Suppose that, for at least one
i ∈ {1, 2}, we have

(r + 1)di − rgi + r ≥ rn.

Then C1 ∪Γ C2 → Pr is a WBN-curve.
Proof. Without loss of generality, suppose Ci is general in some component of M gi(Pr, di), for
both i ∈ {1, 2}; and also that (r + 1)d1 − rg1 + r ≥ rn. Note that H 1(f ∗
2 TPr ) = 0 by Lemma 2.2.
By Lemma 2.3, it therefore suﬃces to show H 1(f ∗

1 TPr(−Γ)) = 0.

If C1 is degenerate, then Γ is linearly independent (it is a general set of points which does
not span Pr); the result thus follows from Lemma 2.2. If C1 is nondegenerate, the result follows
from Theorem 1.2 of [5].

Theorem 2.5 (Theorem 1.4). Let H ⊂ Pr be a hyperplane, f : C → Pr and g : D → H ֒→ Pr
be WBN-curves, with D lying in H and C transverse to H, which pass through a set Γ ⊂ Pr of
n general points. Suppose that, writing d and g for the degree and genus of C, we have

d − rg − 1 ≥ 0 and (r + 1)d − rg + r ≥ rn.

Then C ∪Γ D → Pr is a WBN-curve.
Proof. Without loss of generality, suppose C is general in some component of M g(Pr, d), and D
is general in some component of M g′(H, d′) (for d′ and g′ the degree and genus of D). Note that
H 1(g∗TPr) = 0 by Lemma 2.2; by Lemma 2.3, it therefore suﬃces to show H 1(f ∗TPr (−Γ)) = 0.
As in the proof of Theorem 1.3, this follows from Lemma 2.2 when C1 is degenerate, and

from Theorem 1.4 of [5] when C1 is nondegenerate.

3 WBN-curves and Deformation Theory

In this section, we prove the key lemmas which enable us to use degeneration in the proof of
the main theorem.

We begin with a gentle reminder on the deformation theory of maps: If f : X → Y is an
immersion between lci schemes, then ﬁrst-order deformations of f and obstructions to lifting
them lie in the cohomology groups H 0(Nf ) and H 1(Nf ) respectively of the normal bundle:

Nf = Nf (C)/Pr := Hom(N ∨

f , OX ),

where N ∨

f is the conormal bundle:

ker(f ∗ΩY → ΩX ).

When f is no longer an immersion, the same holds provided we work in the derived category

Db(Coh(X)); we deﬁne the normal complex :

Nf := RHom(N ∨

f , OX ),

where N ∨

f denotes the conormal complex :

f ∗ΩY → ΩX

(with f ∗ΩY in degree 0 and ΩX in degree 1). First-order deformations of f and obstructions to
lifting them then lie in the hypercohomology groups H0(Nf ) and H1(Nf ).

The reader unaccustomed to derived categories is advised to assume all maps are immersions
in this section — in which case the same proofs work with “normal complex” replaced by
“normal bundle” et cetra — and then take the result when the necessary maps may not be
immersions on faith.

Deﬁnition 3.1. We say a stable curve f : C → Pr is an interior curve if it lies in a unique
component of the corresponding Kontsevich space.

Lemma 3.2. Let Γ ⊂ Pr be a general set of points, and f : C → Pr be general in some
component of the space of WBN-curves passing through Γ. Then H1(Nf (−Γ)) = 0 (where by
abuse of notation we write Γ ⊂ C for a set of points mapping injectively under f onto Γ).

Proof. Since (f, Γ) is a general marked WBN-curve, the component of M g,n(Pr, d) containing it
is generically reduced of the expected dimension by Lemma 2.1. By assumption, this component
dominates (Pr)n, so the vertical tangent space H0(Nf (−Γ)) of M g,n(Pr, d) → (Pr)n at [(f, Γ)]
is of the expected dimension χ(Nf (−Γ)).

By examination, the only nonvanishing cohomology groups of N ∨

Moreover, since f is a general WBN-curve, f is generically unramiﬁed; this implies H 1(N ∨
punctual. Using the spectral sequence

f are H 0(N ∨

f ) and H 1(N ∨

f ).
f ) is

Exti(H j(N ∨

f ), O(−Γ)) ⇒ Hi−j(Nf (−Γ)),

we conclude Hk(Nf (−Γ)) = 0 for k /∈ {0, 1}. Since dim H0(Nf (−Γ)) = χ(Nf (−Γ)) from above,
this implies H1(Nf (−Γ)) = 0 as desired.

Lemma 3.3. Let f : X ∪Γ Y → Pr be a reducible curve, and let F be a ﬂat sheaf on X. If
H1(N(f |X ) ⊗ F ) = 0, then H1((Nf )|X ⊗ F ) = 0.
Proof. The following diagram with exact columns

f |∗

XΩPr −−−→ ΩX

gives an exact triangle in Db(Coh(X)):

OΓ[1] → N ∨

f |X → N ∨

f |X → .

Upon applying RHom(−, OX ), twisting by F , and taking hypercohomology, we get a long exact
sequence

· · · → H1(Nf |X ⊗ F ) → H1(Nf |X ⊗ F ) → H1(RHom(OΓ[1], OX) ⊗ F ) → · · · .

It thus remains to show H1(RHom(OΓ[1], OX ) ⊗ F ) = 0. But

H1(RHom(OΓ[1], OX ) ⊗ F ) ≃ H1(RHom(OΓ[1], F )) ≃ Ext2(OΓ, F ) = 0.

Lemma 3.4. Let f : X ∪Γ Y → Pr be a reducible curve. If H1(Nf |X (−Γ)) = H1(Nf |Y ) = 0, then
H1(Nf ) = 0; thus f is an interior curve. (In particular, when f |X and f |Y are both immersions,
then H 1(NX(−Γ)) = H 1(NY ) = 0 implies f is an interior curve.)
Proof. Note that a smooth point of a scheme lies in a unique component; thus H1(Nf ) = 0
implies f is an interior curve. To show H1(Nf ) = 0 as desired, we use (the long exact sequence
in hypercohomology attached to) the normal complex exact triangle

Nf |X(−Γ) → Nf → Nf |Y →,

which reduces our problem to showing

H1(Nf |X(−Γ)) = H1(Nf |Y ) = 0.

i : C ◦

Using Lemma 3.3, this follows from our assumption H1(Nf |X (−Γ)) = H1(Nf |Y ) = 0.
i → Pr is a specialization of Ci → Pr in
Lemma 3.5. Fix i ∈ {1, 2}, and suppose f ◦
Proposition 1.2, which still passes through the general set of points Γ, and satisﬁes H1(Nf ◦
) = 0.
Then we can specialize Ci to C ◦
i in Proposition 1.2. (So long as we leave the other curve general.)
Proof. Without loss of generality, we suppose i = 1. Write Kj = M gj,n(Pr, dj) and P = (Pr)n.
Our pair of curves (C1, C2) in Proposition 1.2 then corresponds to a point (which we may
as well suppose is the generic point), in some component of the ﬁber product K1 ×P K2 which
dominates P. As K1 is irreducible, any component of K1 ×P K2 which dominates P in fact
dominates K1. This means there exists a specialization of (C1, C2) of the form (C ◦
1 , C2), where
C 2 satisﬁes the assumptions (and therefore conclusions) of Lemma 3.2.

i

Applying Lemma 3.4, the specialization C ◦

BN-curve, we can thus conclude C1 ∪Γ C2 → Pr is a BN-curve as desired.

4 Proof of Theorem 1.2

For this section, we adopt the notation of Theorem 1.2; that is, we let Ci → Pr (for i ∈ {1, 2})
be nonspecial BN-curves of degree di and genus gi, which pass through a set Γ ⊂ Pr of n general
points.

Our argument will be by induction on the total degree d1 + d2, and for ﬁxed total degree
by induction on n. There will be several cases to consider, but in each case our argument will
follow the following outline:

1 ∪Γ0 C ′′

We may begin by supposing without loss of generality that both curves Ci → Pr are gen-
eral in some component of the space of NNS-curves passing through Γ. As mentioned in
the introduction, our goal is to degenerate one curve, say f1 : C1 → Pr, to a reducible curve
1 → Pr are NNS-curves and NS-curves respectively,

1 + g′′
meeting eachother in a speciﬁed number of points n0 = #Γ0 (with g′
1 + n0 − 1 = g1). Let
n′ and n′′ be the integers with n′ + n′′ = n, for which we desire C ′
1 to pass through n′ points
Γ′ ⊆ Γ and C ′′

1 to pass through n′′ points Γ′′ ⊆ Γ, with Γ′ ∪ Γ′′ = Γ. We verify:

1 = d1), with speciﬁed genera g′

(b) Otherwise, d′′

1 − max(n′′, n0) ≥ 0. Note that when C ′′

1 is a line (i.e. d′′

1 = 1

and g′′

1 = 0), this inequality becomes max(n′′, n0) ≤ 2.

3. C ′

1 ∪Γ0 C ′′

1 → Pr satisﬁes the assumptions of Theorem 1.3. In every application, we can

just check n0 ≤ r + 2, since this implies

1 ∪Γ0 C ′′

These assumptions imply we can degenerate C1 → Pr to C ′

1 → Pr: Conditions 1
and 2 imply — via Corollary 1.4 of [1] (for 1/2a), or Remark 1.1 (for 2b) — that C ′
1 and C ′′
1
pass through a set Γ0 of n0 general points. Applying Theorem 1.3 and Condition 3, this shows
1 → Pr is a BN-curve. Additionally, our assumptions imply such a degeneration can
C ′
1 pass through sets Γ′ and Γ′′, of cardinality n′ and n′′, with
be performed so that C ′
Γ = Γ′ ∪ Γ′′: Indeed, the construction can be phrased as ﬁrst ﬁnding a curve C ′′
1 through Γ′′;
such a curve also passes through a general set Γ0 of n0 general points by assumption; we then
1 passing through Γ′ ∪ Γ0. Moreover, applying Lemma 3.2 and 3.4, and using
ﬁnd a curve C ′
the generality of Γ0, we see that H1(Nf ◦
1 ) = 0. From Lemma 3.5, it therefore suﬃces to show
(C ′

1 ) ∪Γ C2 → Pr is a BN-curve. We then verify:

1 and C ′′

1 ∪Γ0 C ′′

1 ∪Γ′′ C2 → Pr satisﬁes the assumptions of either

We then verify:

1 ∪Γ′′ C2 → Pr is a BN-curve, by application of Theorem 1.3 (for 4b), or by
1 + d2 < d1 + d2.

5. C ′

1 ∪Γ0∪Γ′ (C ′′

1 ∪Γ′′ C2) → Pr satisﬁes the assumptions of either

(a) Theorem 1.2, in which case we also have n0 ≤ n′′. In every application, we may
verify the assumptions of Theorem 1.2 by either checking that both curves are limit
linearly normal, i.e. checking that

d′
1 = g′

1 + r

and d′′

1 + d2 = g′′

1 + g2 + n′′ − 1 + r;

or by taking i = 2, for which it suﬃces to show

(r + 1)(d′′

1 + d2) − (r − 3)((g′′

1 + g2 + n′′ − 1) − 1) − (r − 1)(n0 + n′) ≥ 4.

(b) Theorem 1.3. In every application, we may check n0 + n′ ≤ r + 2, which implies the

required inequality (r + 1)d′

1 − rg′

1 + r ≥ r(n0 + n′) as in Condition 3.

This either completes the proof (for 5b), or reduces us inductively to another instance of
Theorem 1.2 (for 5a). This other instance has the same total degree; and since n0 ≤ n′′ implies
#(Γ0 ∪ Γ′) = n0 + n′ ≤ n′′ + n′ = n, the value of n does not increase. If n0 < n′′ in 5a, then
n decreases, so we are done by induction; otherwise, we must show this inequality is at least
strict eventually after running the entire argument a ﬁnite number of times.

Before starting the proof, let us rewrite our assumption that C1 ∪Γ C2 → Pr has nonnegative

Brill-Noether number in a more convenient form:

ρ(C1 ∪Γ C2 → Pr) = (r + 1)(d1 + d2) − r(g1 + g2 + n − 1) − r(r + 1)

= [(r + 1)d1 + rg1 − r(r + 1)] + [(r + 1)d1 + rg1 − r(r + 1)] − rn + r(r + 2)
= ρ(C1 → Pr) + ρ(C2 → Pr) − rn + r(r + 2);

and so our assumption is equivalent to

n ≤ r + 2 +

ρ(C1 → Pr) + ρ(C2 → Pr)

r

.

(1)

Proof when n ≤ r + 2. As in Condition 3, this implies the assumptions of Theorem 1.3 are
satisﬁed; applying Theorem 1.3 thus yields the desired result.

Proof when di = gi + r for both i ∈ {1, 2}. For ﬁxed d1 + d2 and ﬁxed n, we argue by induction
on min(g1, g2). Without loss of generality, suppose g1 ≤ g2. Since ρ(g +r, g, r) = g, Equation (1)
becomes

d1 = g1 + r, our second inequality rearranges to give

If g1 = 0, and (r − 1)n ≥ 4g2 + r
(g2, r) ∈ {(5, 3), (7, 5)}: Since C1 is a rational normal curve, it can only pass through n
points if

(r − 1)n ≤ (r + 1)d1 − (r − 3)(g1 − 1) = (r − 1)(r + 3) ⇔ n ≤ r + 3.

Our inequality then gives

with strict inequality unless (g2, r) ∈ {(5, 3), (7, 5)}. Thus g2 ≤ r − 1, so this falls into a case
already considered (“If g1 = 0 and g2 ≤ r − 1”).

If (r − 1)n ≥ 4g1 + r

Consequently,

4g1 + r2 + 2r − 7 ≤ (r − 1)n ≤ (r − 1)(r + 3) ⇔ g1 ≤ 1,

with strict inequality unless (g1, r) ∈ {(3, 3), (3, 5)}. In particular, g1 = 0, so this falls into a
case already considered (“If g1 = 0 and g2 ≤ r − 1”).

If (r − 1)n ≥ 4g1 + r
and (r − 1)n ≥ 4g2 + r
Adding these two inequalities together, we obtain

2 + 2r − 7 with strict inequality unless (g1, r) ∈ {(3, 3), (3, 5)},
2 − r − 4 with strict inequality unless (g2, r) ∈ {(5, 3), (7, 5)}:

(2r − 2)n ≥ 4(g1 + g2) + 2r2 + r − 11,

with strict inequality unless r ∈ {3, 5}. Combining with Equation (2),

(2r − 2)(cid:18)r + 2 +

g1 + g2

r (cid:19) ≥ 4(g1 + g2) + 2r2 + r − 11;

or upon rearrangement

g1 + g2 ≤

r2 + 7r
2r + 2

= r + 1 −

(r − 1)(r − 2)

2r + 2

.

This holds with strict inequality unless r ∈ {3, 5}; in particular we always have

g1 + g2 ≤ r.

Since the case g1 = 0 was already considered (“If g1 = 0, and (r − 1)(n − 1) ≥ 4g2 + r2 − 2r − 3
with strict inequality except when (g2, r) ∈ {(5, 3), (7, 5)}”), we may suppose g1 ≥ 1; the above
inequality then gives g2 ≤ r − 1, so we are again in a case already considered (“If (r − 1)n ≥
4g1 + r2 + 2r − 7 with strict inequality unless (g1, r) ∈ {(2, 3), (2, 5)}, and g2 ≤ r − 1”).

Except when both curves are limit linearly normal (which was considered above), we have

by assumption that for at least one i ∈ {1, 2},

(r + 1)di − (r − 3)(gi − 1) − (r − 1)n ≥(2 if di > gi + r;

4 if di = gi + r.

(3)

For the remainder of the paper, assume without loss of generality that this happens for i = 1.

Proof when d1 > g1 + r, assuming Equation (3) is strict if (d1, g1, r) ∈ {(6, 2, 3), (8, 2, 5)}.
First note that Equation (3) rearranges to give

(r − 1)(n − 1) ≤ (r + 1)(d1 − 1) − (r − 3)(g1 − 1),

with strict inequality in the cases (d1 − 1, g1, r) ∈ {(5, 2, 3), (7, 2, 5)}.

Next note that (r + 1)d2 − (r − 3)(g2 − 1) ≥ (r − 1)n (c.f. Corollary 1.4 of [1]); or upon

rearrangement,

(r + 1)(d2 + 1) − (r − 3)((g2 + 1) − 1) − (r − 1)(n − 1) ≥ r + 3 ≥ 4.

Proof when d1 = g1 + r. We may suppose d2 > g2 + r, since the case where di = gi + r for both
i ∈ {1, 2} has been considered already (“Proof when di = gi + r for both i ∈ {1, 2}”).

As above, note that (r + 1)d2 − (r − 3)(g2 − 1) ≥ (r − 1)n (c.f. Corollary 1.4 of [1]); or upon

rearrangement,

(r + 1)(d2 + 1) − (r − 3)((g2 + 1) − 1) − (r − 1)n ≥ 4 > 2.

First suppose that Equation (3) is strict if (d1, g1, r) ∈ {(6, 3, 3), (8, 3, 5)}. Upon rearrange-

ment, this gives

(r − 1)n ≤ (r + 1)(d1 − 1) − (r − 3)((g1 − 1) − 1),

1 = g1 − 1, and C ′′

with strict inequality in the cases (d1 − 1, g1, r) ∈ {(5, 2, 3), (7, 2, 5)}.

In this case, we degenerate C1 → Pr to C ′

and genus g′
1 = 0), and n0 = #Γ0 = 2; we let
n′ = n − 2 and n′′ = 2. Conditions 1, 2b, 3, 4b, and 5a (with i = 2), from the previous
discussion are easily veriﬁed. The inequality n0 ≤ n′′ in 5a is an equality; but upon exchanging
indices, we are in the previous case (“Proof when d1 > g1 + r, assuming Equation (3) is strict
if (d1, g1, r) ∈ {(6, 2, 3), (8, 2, 5)}”), so that completes the induction.

1 = 1 and g′′

1 is of degree d′

It remains to consider the cases where (d1, g1, r) ∈ {(6, 3, 3), (8, 3, 5)} and Equation (3) is

an equality, i.e.

(r + 1)d1 − (r − 3)(g1 − 1) − (r − 1)n = 4 ⇒ n =

(r + 1)d1 − (r − 3)(g1 − 1) − 4

r − 1

= 10.

From Equation (1), that gives

10 ≤ r + 2 +

3 + ρ(C2 → Pr)

r

⇒ ρ(C2 → Pr) ≥ −r2 + 8r − 3.

This gives

(r + 1)d2 − (r − 3)(g2 − 1) = [(r + 1)d2 − rg2 − r(r + 1)] + r(r + 2) + 3(g2 − 1)

≥ −r2 + 8r − 3 + r(r + 2) − 3
= 10r − 6.

Consequently,

(r + 1)d2 − (r − 3)(g2 − 1) − (r − 1)n ≥ 10r − 6 − 10(r − 1) = 4 > 2.

Exchanging indices, this falls into the previous case (“Proof when d1 > g1 + r, assuming (3)
is strict if (d1, g1, r) ∈ {(6, 2, 3), (8, 2, 5)}”).

11

Proof when (d1, g1, r) ∈ {(6, 2, 3), (8, 2, 5)} and Equation (3) is an equality. We have

(r + 1)d1 − (r − 3)(g1 − 1) − (r − 1)n = 2 ⇒ n =

(r + 1)d1 − (r − 3)(g1 − 1) − 2

r − 1

= 11.

From Equation (1), that gives

11 ≤ r + 2 +

(r + 3) + ρ(C2 → Pr)

r

⇒ ρ(C2 → Pr) ≥ −r2 + 8r − 3.

As before this implies

(r + 1)d2 − (r − 3)(g2 − 1) − (r − 1)n ≥ 4.

So exchanging indices, this falls into one of the previous two cases. (“Proof when d1 = g1 + r” or
“Proof when d1 > g1 + r, assuming Equation (3) is strict if (d1, g1, r) ∈ {(6, 2, 3), (8, 2, 5)}”).
