We report an investigation of

temperature and IrMn layered thickness dependence of
anomalous-Hall resistance (AHR), anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), and magnetization on
Pt/Ir20Mn80/Y3Fe5O12 (Pt/IrMn/YIG) heterostructures. The magnitude of AHR is dramatically
enhanced compared with Pt/YIG bilayers. The enhancement is much more profound at higher
temperatures and peaks at the IrMn thickness of 3 nm. The observed spin-Hall magnetoresistance
(SMR) in the temperature range of 10-300 K indicates that the spin current generated in the Pt
layer can penetrate the entire thickness of the IrMn layer to interact with the YIG layer. The
lack of conventional anisotropic magnetoresistance (CAMR) implies that the insertion of the IrMn
layer between Pt and YIG eﬃciently suppresses the magnetic proximity eﬀect (MPE) on induced
Pt moments by YIG. Our results suggest that the dual roles of the InMn insertion in Pt/IrMn/YIG
heterostructures are to block the MPE and to transport the spin current between Pt and YIG layers.
We discuss possible mechanisms for the enhanced AHR.

Antiferromagnts (AFMs) are promising candidates
for spintronic applications.1 Compared to ferromagnetic
(FM) materials, the AFMs exhibit unique advantages,
e.g., zero net magnetization, insensitivity to the exter-
nal magnetic perturbation, lack of stray ﬁeld, and ac-
cess to extremely high frequency. Recently, the gener-
ation and transmission of spin current in AFMs have
attracted great attention. The spin pumping studies
on (Pt, Ta)/(NiO, CoO)/Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) heterostruc-
tures demonstrate that the spin current generated in YIG
layer can pass through the antiferromagnetic (AFM) in-
sulator NiO or CoO layer and can be detected in Pt
or Ta layer by inverse spin-Hall eﬀect (ISHE).2–5 Sim-
ilar results were also revealed in (Pt, Ta)/IrMn/CoFeB
or Pt/NiO/FeNi heterostructures by spin-torque ferro-
magnetic resonance (ST-FMR) technique, where the spin
current generated by spin-Hall eﬀect (SHE) in Pt or
Ta layer can propagate through IrMn or NiO layer and
change the FMR linewidth.6–8 The spin current gen-
erated by spin pumping or spin Seebeck was also ob-
served in IrMn/YIG, Cr/YIG, and XMn/Py (X = Fe,
Pd, Ir, and Pt) bilayers through ISHE.9–12 Moreover,
the IrMn/YIG, Pt/Cr2O3, and Pt/MnF2 exhibit spin-
Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) and large ISHE voltage,
respectively, implying that the AFMs can be both spin-
current detector and generator.13–15 These investigations
open up new opportunities in developing the AFMs-
based spin-current devices.

The IrMn alloy, which have been widely used to pin
an adjacent FM layer in spin valve devices via exchange
bias,16 demonstrates large ISHE voltage when in con-
tacts with YIG.9 Recently, a large SHE and anomalous-

Hall eﬀect (AHE) have been theoretically proposed in
Cr, FeMn, and IrMn AFMs owing to their large spin-
orbit coupling (SOC) or Berry phase of the non-collinear
spin textures.17–19 These theoretical predictions were also
found to be valid for other cubic non-collinear AFMs,
e.g., SnMn3 and GeMn3, where the calculations have
been repeated with comparable results.20 The experimen-
tal investigation of AHE and SHE on the AFMs could be
helpful from both fundamental and practical viewpoints
for AFMs spintronics. As previously revealed in Cr/YIG
bilayers, the large anomalous-Hall resistance (AHR) in
thin unprotected Cr ﬁlm is likely caused by the surface
FM Cr oxides.10 Similar situation is expected in unpro-
tected IrMn/YIG bilayers. Since the Pt/YIG bilayer is
well studied,21 in this study, we choose the Pt as cap
layer to protect the IrMn from oxidation to investigate
the AHE and SHE of IrMn by measuring the spin trans-
port properties in Pt/IrMn/YIG heterostructures.

The Pt/IrMn/YIG heterostructures were prepared in
a combined ultra-high vacuum (10−9 Torr) pulsed laser
deposition (PLD) and magnetron sputter system. The
high quality epitaxial YIG ﬁlms were deposited on (111)-
orientated single crystalline Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG) sub-
strate via PLD technique as described elsewhere.22 The
Ir20Mn80 (IrMn) and Pt ﬁlms were sputtered at room
temperature in argon atmosphere in an in situ process.
The thickness and crystal structure of ﬁlms were char-
acterized by Bruker D8 Discover high-resolution x-ray
diﬀractometer (HRXRD). The thickness was estimated
by using the software package LEPTOS (Bruker AXS).
The surface topography of the ﬁlms was measured in a
Bruker Icon atomic force microscope. The ferromagnetic

resonance spectrometers. The measurements of trans-
verse Hall resistance, longitudinal resistance, and mag-
netization were carried out in a Quantum Design physi-
cal properties measurement system (PPMS) with a rota-
tion option and magnetic properties measurement system
(MPMS), respectively.

Figure 1(a) plots a representative room-temperature
2θ-ω XRD pattern of epitaxial YIG/GGG ﬁlm near the
(444) reﬂections. Clear Laue oscillations indicate the ﬂat-
ness and uniformity of the epitaxial YIG ﬁlm. As shown
in the Fig. 1(b), only the (222) and (444) reﬂections can
be observed, and no indication of impurities or misorien-
tation was detected in the full range of 2θ-ω scan. In this
study, the thicknesses of YIG and Pt ﬁlms, determined
by simulation of the x-ray reﬂectivity (XRR) spectra, are
approximately 60 nm and 3 nm, respectively, while the
IrMn thickness ranges from 0 nm to 8 nm. The atomic
force microscope surface topography of Pt/IrMn(3)/YIG
heterostructure over an area of 5 µm × 5 µm in Fig.

ﬁlms show similar surface roughness. The number in the

As shown in the top panel of Fig.

in order to
measure the transverse Hall resistance and longitudinal
resistance, all the Pt/IrMn/YIG heterostructures were
patterned into Hall-bar conﬁguration (central area: 0.3
mm × 10 mm; electrode 0.3 mm × 1 mm). The trans-
verse Hall resistance Rxy of Pt/IrMn/YIG was mea-
sured in the temperature range of 10 K to 300 K with
perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld ranging from -70 to 70
kOe.
In metal thin ﬁlm, the ordinary-Hall resistance
(OHR) ROHR is subtracted from the measured Rxy, i.e.,
RAHR = Rxy - ROHR×µ0H, where RAHR is AHR. As
shown in Figs. 2(d)-(e), the measured Rxy as a func-
tion of magnetic ﬁeld for Pt/YIG and Pt/IrMn(1)/YIG
are presented. The opposite coeﬃcient of OHR in
Pt/YIG and Pt/IrMn/YIG is related to the diﬀerent
type of carriers in Pt and IrMn layers.13,26 The result-

ing RAHR are plotted in Figs. 2(f)-(g), with the other
Pt/IrMn/YIG heterostructures showing similar behav-
iors to Pt/IrMn(1)/YIG. It is noted that the Pt becomes
magnetic when in contacts with the YIG due to its prox-
imity to the stoner ferromagnetic instability, i.e., mag-
netic proximity eﬀect (MPE), as previously shown exper-
imentally by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)
and theoretically by ﬁrst-principles calculation.23,24 The
magnetized Pt shares some common features as mag-
i.e., strong anisotropy.22 Thus, when
netic YIG ﬁlm,
the magnetic ﬁeld approaches zero, the magnetized Pt
moments are randomly distributed, the Rxy exhibits ir-
regular M-shaped behavior close to zero ﬁeld. How-
ever, for Pt/IrMn/YIG, the Rxy continuously decreases
as approaching zero ﬁeld, implying that the Pt/IrMn and
IrMn/YIG interfaces are free of MPE, being consistent
with the absence of conventional anisotropic magnetore-
sistance (CAMR) (see below). We summarize the derived
anomalous-Hall resistivity ρAHR of Pt/IrMn/YIG het-
erostrutures as functions of temperature (T ) and IrMn
thickness (tIrMn) in Figs. 2(h)-(i). The ρAHR(T ) for
all the Pt/IrMn/YIG exhibits rich characteristics whose
magnitude and sign are highly non-trivial, which were
also observed in Pt/LaCoO3 bilayers.25 As an example,
the AHR for Pt/YIG and Pt/IrMn(1)/YIG are plotted
in the inset of Fig. 2(h). Since the Pt/YIG exhibits siz-
able AHR and has the same sign as IrMn/YIG,13,22,26
we roughly estimate the IrMn contributions according to
∆ρAHR = ρAHR (Pt/IrMn/YIG) - ρAHR (Pt/YIG). As
shown in Fig. 2(h), the magnitude of ∆ρAHR decrease
with temperature and then it increases again below 100
K. Simultaneously, the ∆ρAHR change its sign at the tem-
perature which is independent of IrMn thickness. We also
replotted all the ∆ρAHR as a function of IrMn thickness
in Fig. 2(i). As increasing the tIrMn, the ∆ρAHR also

The

(AMR)

increases and reaches a maximum around tIrMn = 3 nm;
By further increasing tIrMn, the ∆ρAHR decreases to -14
pΩm and 28 pΩm for tIrMn = 8 nm at T = 10 K and 300
K, but they are still much larger than that of Pt/YIG
bilayers with the same Pt thickness.22,27
anisotropic magnetoresistance

for
Pt/IrMn/YIG was also measured down to low temper-
atures in a magnetic ﬁeld of 30 kOe. As an example,
the AMR of Pt/IrMn(1)/YIG for three diﬀerent ﬁeld
scans are presented in the left panel of Fig. 3. When
the magnetic ﬁeld scans within the xy plane [Fig. 3(a)],
both the CAMR and SMR contribute to the total AMR;
for the xz plane [Fig. 3(b)], the resistance changes are
attributed to the MPE-induced CAMR; for the yz plane
[Fig. 3(c)], the CAMR is zero, and only the SMR are
expected.28,29 As shown in Fig. 3(b), the θxz scan shows
negligible AMR and the resistance is almost independent
of θxz,
indicating the extremely weak MPE at the
interface even down to low temperatures. However, the
MPE is signiﬁcant at Pt/YIG interface: the amplitude
of CAMR is around 2.2 × 10−4, which is comparable to
the SMR.22 Thus, the IrMn can be used as clean spin
current detector and generator, similar to the normal Rh
or AFM Cr metals.10,22 Since the CAMR is negligible in
Pt/IrMn(1)/YIG, the SMR dominates the AMR when
the magnetic ﬁeld is varied within the xy plane, the
amplitudes of θxy scan are almost identical to θyz scan.
The temperature dependence of the SMR amplitudes
for both θxy and θyz scans are summarized in Fig. 3(d).
Upon decreasing the temperature, the SMR persists
down to 10 K, with the amplitudes monotonically
decreasing from 7.5 × 10−5 (300 K) to 3.0 × 10−5
(10 K) in Pt/IrMn(1)/YIG. For Pt/IrMn/YIG, the
amplitudes of SMR are almost an order smaller than
that of the Pt/YIG due to the smaller spin-Hall angle,
shorter spin diﬀusion length and larger electrical resis-
tivity of IrMn.9,11,28 The temperature characteristics
of SMR amplitudes in Pt/IrMn/YIG are signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from the Pt/YIG or Pd/YIG bilayers, where
the SMR amplitudes exhibit nonmonotonic temperature
dependence and acquire a maximum around 100 K.30,31
For Pt/YIG, the temperature dependence of SMR
amplitude can be described by a single spin-relaxation
mechanism,30 while for Pt/IrMn/YIG, the spin diﬀusion
length, spin-Hall angle, and electrical resistivity of IrMn
are diﬀerent from the Pt, further theoretical models are
needed to describe these phenomena. As increasing the
IrMn thickness, the Pt/IrMn(3)/YIG exhibits similar
temperature dependent characteristics but with diﬀerent
numerical values, as the green symbols shown in Fig.
3(d). However, in Pt/IrMn(5)/YIG, there is no visible
AMR in the studied temperature range due to short spin
diﬀusion length of IrMn.11 The sizable SMR observed in
Pt/IrMn/YIG heterostructures indicates that the spin
current can transport through IrMn layer.

Since the magnetic transitions of very thin AFMs
are expected to be well below the ordering temper-
ature of bulk forms, we measured the ﬁeld depen-

dence of magnetization down to low temperatures, from
which we can track the AFM blocking temperature
Tb for Pt/IrMn/YIG heterostructures. As an exam-
ple, the normalized magnetic hysteresis loops M /Ms for
Pt/IrMn(1)/YIG at various temperatures after ﬁeld cool-
ing from 300 K are presented in Fig. 4(a). The derived
exchange bias ﬁeld HE versus temperature are summa-
rized in Fig. 4(b), from which the Tb are approximately
estimated to be 150 K, 180 K, and 220 K for 1 nm, 3
nm and 5 nm IrMn, respectively, as the arrow indicated.
Similar blocking temperatures were previously reported
in IrMn/MgO/Ta tunnel junctions and IrMn/NiFe bi-
layer.32,33 Moreover, the coercivity HC also exhibits a
step-like increase near the blocking temperature, as the
arrow shown in the inset of Fig. 4(b), indicating the
strongly enhanced exchange coupling between IrMn and
YIG layer below Tb.

Based on the above experimental results, we discuss
the origins of the signiﬁcant AHR in Pt/IrMn/YIG het-
erostructures and the eﬀect of AFM order on spin trans-
port properties. There are at least four contributions
to the observed AHR in Pt/IrMn/YIG: MPE, spin-Hall
based SMR, spin-dependent interface scattering, and in-
trinsic properties of IrMn metal.
In contrast to the
Pt/YIG, the negligible CAMR in Pt/IrMn/YIG indi-
cates the extremely weak MPE at Pt/IrMn or IrMn/YIG
interfaces, which is diﬀerent from the previous studied
of IrMn/YIG bilayer.13 The SMR model based on SHE
also predicts an anomalous-Hall-like resistance,28 whose
magnitude and sign are determined by the spin diﬀu-
sion length and spin-Hall angle of the metal and the
imaginary part of the spin mixing conductance, respec-
tively. Though the thickness dependence of the AHR

4

in Pt/IrMn/YIG can be described by the SMR model,
it fails to explain the AHR by the following reasons:
(i) An arbitrary temperature dependence of the imag-
inary part of the spin mixing conductance parameter
is required to qualitatively describe the temperature-
dependent AHR data, i.e., sign reversal; (ii) According to
the spin pumping studies, both the spin-Hall angle and
the spin diﬀusion length of IrMn are smaller than Pt,
which cannot explain the enhancement of AHR by in-
creasing the IrMn thickness.9,11,12 Spin-dependent scat-
tering at the interface, combined with the conventional
skew-scattering and side-jump mechanisms, can also give
rise to AHR.34 Again, the enhancement of AHR by in-
creasing the IrMn thickness excludes the interfacial ori-
gin. Finally, the theoretical calculations predict a large
AHE and SHE in IrMn metal not only attributed to the
large SOC of heavy Ir atoms which is transferred to the
magnetic Mn atoms by hybridization eﬀect but also the
Berry phase of the non-collinear spin structures.17–19 We
conclude that the large AHR observed in Pt/IrMn/YIG
is likely associated with SOC and non-collinear magnetic
structure of IrMn. However, the non-trivial temperature
dependence of AHR demands further theoretical and ex-
perimental investigations.

Now we discuss the possible interplay between AFM
order and spin transport properties. As shown in Fig.
2 and Fig. 3, there is no clear anomalous in AHR or
SMR near the blocking temperatures of IrMn, imply-
ing weak correlations between the AHE or SHE and the
AFM order in IrMn. Similar results were also observed
in Cr/YIG bilayers, where the ISHE voltage and AHR
is also independent of AFM ordering temperature.10 Ac-
cording to our magnetization results (Fig. 4), the AFM
ordering temperatures of our IrMn ﬁlms are well below
room temperature. However, the enhancement of AHR
in Pt/IrMn/YIG happens in the whole studied tempera-
ture range [see Fig. 2(i)]. There are two possible reasons
for this phenomenon, one is that the AHE and SHE at-
tributed to non-collinear magnetism is generated on a
length scale of nanometer and is a local property not
relying on long range magnetic order, i.e., regardless of
how IrMn grains are orientated, as reported previously
in Mn5Si3 ﬁlm.35 The second one is that the strength of
SOC is independent of AFM order in IrMn metal, which
is mainly determined by the Ir atoms.

In summary, we report an investigation of AHE and
SHE by measuring the AHR and SMR in Pt/IrMn/YIG
heterostrucutres. The signiﬁcant AHR in Pt/IrMn/YIG
is likely associated with the strong SOC and non-collinear
magnetic structure of IrMn, and the sizable SMR in-
dicates that the spin current can transport through
IrMn. The observed non-trivial temperature dependence
of AHR cannot be consistently explained by the existing
theories, further investigations are needed to clarify this
issue. Moreover, both the AHR and SMR are uncoupled
to the AFM order of IrMn metal. The negligible MPE
at Pt/IrMn or IrMn/YIG interface and large ISHE indi-
cate that IrMn can be another model system to explore

physics and devices associated with antiferromagnetism
and pure spin current.
