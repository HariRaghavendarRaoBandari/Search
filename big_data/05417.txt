ABSTRACT
Gravity plays a determining role in the evolution of the molecular ISM. In Li & Burkert.
(2016), we proposed a measure called gravitational energy spectra to quantify the impor-
tance of gravity on multiple physical scales. In this work, using a wavelet-based decompo-
sition technique, we derive the gravitational energy spectra of the Orion A and the Orion B
molecular cloud from observational data. The gravitational energy spectra are found to exhibit
power-law-like behaviors. At sub-parsec scale, the Orion A and Orion B molecular cloud
have Ep(k) ∼ k−1.88 and Ep(k) ∼ k−2.09, respectively. These scaling exponents are close to
the scaling exponents of the kinetic energy power spectra of compressible turbulence (where
E ∼ k−2), with a near-equipartition of turbulent versus gravitational energy on multiple scales.
This provides a clear evidence that gravity is able to counteract eﬀectively against turbulent
motion for these length scales. The results conﬁrm our earlier analytical estimates. For the
Orion A molecular cloud, gravity inevitably dominates over turbulence inside the cloud. Our
work provides a clear observational proof that gravity is playing a determining role in the evo-
lution of star-forming molecular clouds from the cloud scale down to ∼ 0.1 pc. The method is
general and should be applicable to all the astrophysical problems where gravity plays a role.

INTRODUCTION

Star formation takes place at the dense and shielded parts of the in-
terstellar medium (see Dobbs et al. 2014, for a review). Gravity is
a long-range force, and plays a determining role in molecular cloud
evolution. Observational constraints on gravity in star-forming re-
gions are thus crucial for understanding the star formation process.
In the past, the importance of gravity has been quantiﬁed using the
virial parameter (Bertoldi & McKee 1992). However, to evaluate
the virial parameter one needs to specify the boundary of the re-
gion, which introduces additional uncertainties. As a result, it is
not even clear if the dynamics on the cloud scale is dominated by
gravity or not (Heyer et al. 2009; Kritsuk & Norman 2011). Part
of the diﬃculty come from the existence of complicated structures
in the molecular interstellar medium (ISM) reveal by observations
(Schneider & Elmegreen 1979; Williams et al. 2000; Goldsmith
et al. 2008; Men’shchikov et al. 2010).

A few attempts have been made to overcome the limitation
of the virial parameter. One can evaluate the virial parameter at
diﬀerent physical scales by applying it to a dendrogram represen-
tation of the observational data (Goodman et al. 2009; Rosolowsky
et al. 2008). Recently, Li et al. (2015) proposed a method called G-

virial which generalises the concept of the gravitational potential
to observations in the position-position-velocity space. They found
that molecular clouds are close to gravitationally bound when the
boundaries of the regions are determined from the G-virial map.
Gravitational can also behavein a non-uniform fashion, which leads
to fast collapse in localized regions in molecular clouds (Burkert &
Hartmann 2004), Li et al. (2016). However, constraints on the dy-
namical importance of gravity is limited.

To obtain constraints on gravity, one needs to ﬁrst ﬁnd ways
to quantify it. There are a few obvious diﬃculties: First, gravity
is a long-range force. It is not possible to gauge its importance by
isolating the observed cloud into individual regions. Rather, it is
necessary to take the spatial organization of the molecular gas into
account. Second, star formation is a multi-scaled physical process.
A better constraint on gravity needs to be properly formulated such,
that the multi-scaled nature of interstellar medium (ISM) structure
is properly represented.

Along this line of thought, Li et al. (2016) proposed a formal-
ism to represent the multi-scaled structure ISM reveal by the grav-
itational ﬁeld and and to quantify its impact on cloud evolution by
constructing a quantity called gravitational energy spectrum. The
derived gravitational energy spectra are directly comparable to e.g.
the turbulence power spectra. By studying the gravitational energy
spectra of a sample of 8 molecular clouds, Li et al. (2016) found

that molecular clouds are close to a state where the gravitational
energy is comparable to the energy expected from cascade of tur-
bulence. For star-forming clouds, gravity gradually takes over tur-
bulence as one moves from larger to smaller scales.

The fact that the gravitational energy can balance and even
dominate over turbulent motion in star-forming clouds has impor-
tant implications in cloud evolution theory. It provides support for
cloud evolution models such as the hierarchical gravitational col-
lapse model (Hoyle 1953; Elmegreen 1993; Vázquez-Semadeni
et al. 2003). See also (Burkert & Hartmann 2013). These theoretical
possibilities should be further explored. However, in Li et al (2016),
the results are inferred from the surface density PDF, where a shell
model was assumed. Although the authors provided justiﬁcations
why these assumptions are valid, a more detailed study is desired
to validate the simplications made in their model.

We provide observational constraints on the importance of
gravity by combining: (a) State-of-the-art observations of the sur-
face density structure of molecular clouds constructed from ESA’s
Planck and Herschel observations (Lombardi et al. 2014), (b) con-
structing 3D volume density distributions from observational data,
the method we use is an improved version of the method described
in Kainulainen et al. (2014), (c) a formalism to quantify the impor-
tance of gravity on a multiple of scales, proposed in Li et al. (2016),
and (d) a wave-based technique to decompose the gravitational ﬁeld
into multiple components.

We study the gravitational energy spectra of the Orion molec-
ular cloud. The cloud is the most massive active star-forming com-
plex in the solar neighborhood (Bally 2008), and is subject to inten-
sive studies. Based on the slope of the surface density PDFs derived
in Lombardi et al. (2014), Li et al. (2015) obtained constraints on
the gravitational energy spectra for both the Orion A and the Orion
B molecular cloud. They conclude that Orion A molecular cloud
is in a stage where gravity takes over turbulence at smaller scales,
and for Orion B they found that the cloud is close to a critical state
where the gravitational energy and turbulence kinetic energy are
comparable from the cloud scale to sub-parsec scale.

In this paper, we propose a wavelet-based method to construct
multi-scale gravitational energy spectra from observational data.
The method used in this paper is general, can can be applied to
structures with arbitrary geometries. In Sec. 2 we introduce the con-
cept of the gravitational energy spectra. We reconstruct the 3D den-
sity structure of the Orion molecular clouds from the observational
data (Sec. 3). Gravitational potentials of the clouds are constructed
based on the 3D density structures (Sec. 4). A wavelet-based de-
composition technique is used to obtain constraints on gravity over
a multitude of physical scales (Sec. 5). The results are presented
in Sec. 6. In Sec. 7 we compare the observed gravitational energy
spectra with the gravitational energy spectra of a Mach 5.6 com-
pressible turbulence. In Sec. 8 we conclude.

2 PROBING CLOUD FRAGMENTATION WITH

GRAVITATIONAL ENERGY SPECTRA

The meaning of the gravitational energy spectra is illustrated in
Fig. 1. In astrophysical settings, a density distribution ρ(x, y, z) is
composed of structures of diﬀerent sizes. Smaller structures tend to
have higher densities, and tend to reside inside larger structures.
On the coarsest (largest) scale, one can measure the masses m0
and sizes l0 (which satisfy lmin
and lmax
are the lower and upper bounds of the scale l0) of the structures,
and the gravitational energy of the cloud on the coarsest scale is

0 where lmin

0/l0. On a smaller scale, the cloud is composed of sub-
regions of sizes lmin
and masses m1(i), and the total
gravitational energy at this scale is El1
1(i)/l1. One can fur-
ther increase the resolution, and compute the gravitational energy
at even smaller scales e.g. l2, . . . ln until the resolution limit of the
data has been reached. By investigating the dependence of El on l
one can obtain a multi-scale picture of gravitation energy in molec-
ular clouds. For a cloud that has a simple morphology, this can be
achieved analytically (Li et al. 2016). Note that the picture here is
proposed to help achieve am intuitive understand of gravitational
energy spectra. An equivalent yet mathematically rigours way to
deﬁne the gravitationally energy spectra can be achieved by de-
composing the gravitational φ into components of diﬀerent scales
φl and evaluate
To achieve mathematical consistency, one also needs to nor-
malize the gravitational energy E by the range of physical scales
within which E is calculated. Either one has to work with El =
E/(lmax − lmin) or with Ek = E/(kmax − kmin) where k = 2π/l. The
gravitational energy spectra presented in this paper are normalized
according to k. Therefore Ek has a unit of energy divided by wave
number.

ρφld3x. This is explained in Sec. 5.

The gravitational energy spectra deﬁned in this work are a
generalization of those discussed in Li & Burkert (2016), because
here the regions are allowed to have arbitrarily complicated geome-
tries, and in Li & Burkert (2016) only close-to-spherical geometries
are considered.

3 OBSERVATIONS AND SURFACE DENSITY

MODELLING

We obtain observational data from Lombardi et al. (2014). The map
traces column densities 1 × 1021cm−2 < N < 2 × 1023cm−2, and
resolve down to ∼ 36(cid:48)(cid:48) (correspond to 0.07 pc at a distance of 414
pc (Menten et al. 2007)).

Kainulainen et al. (2014) developed a technique to construct
3D density distributions from observational data. The idea is based
on a simple assumption that a smaller gas clump observed in 2D is
related to a smaller clump in real 3D space. Thus, density structure
of a molecular cloud can be reconstructed by decomposing the ob-
servational map into a set of 2D ellipses and by linking the ellipses
with 3D ellipsoids.

Kainulainen et al. (2014) took a two-step approach to recon-
struct 3D density distributions. First, a 2D projected observational
map is decomposed into components of diﬀerent sizes, generating
a so-called size map. Second, each size map is decomposed into a
set of structures with masses Mi and areas Ai. The extent Hi of each
of the structure in the third dimension is estimated. An ellipsoid in
3D can be reconstructed based on Mi, Ai and Hi for each structure.
In this work, we reconstruct the 3D density distribution us-
ing a method that shares a similar spirit with that of Kainulainen
et al. (2014). However, several critical improvements have been
made. First, we have developed an improved method to decompose
the map into contributions from structures of diﬀerent sizes, gen-
erating the “size map”. Kainulainen et al. (2014) used a wavelet-
based method to construct the size map. However, for the Herschel-
Planck surface density map used in this work, because of the im-
proved dynamical range, the wavelet-based method produces nega-
tive artifacts around regions where the column densities have been
signiﬁcantly enhanced. We thus developed an improved decompo-
sition method where signiﬁcant structures of diﬀerent scales are
identiﬁed by an iterative approach. The size map derived from our

Figure 1. An illustration of the concept of the gravitational energy spectrum. Our object is composed of a set of nested structures. Smaller structures (in red)
tend to have higher densities, and tend to reside in larger structures (in yellow). In our gravitational energy spectra plot, the x-axis is the wave number k = 2π/l,
which is inversely proportional to the length scale l. The y-axis is the gravitational energy density (which has a unit of energy divided by the wave number k).
Gravitational energy at the large scale is usually contributed from structures of larger sizes (in yellow), and gravitational energy at small scales is contributed
from structures of small sizes (in red). See Sec. 2 for explanations. The detailed mathematical formula for evaluating the gravitational energy spectra are listed
in the box. The formulas are presented and explained in Sec. 5.

improved method is completely free of negative artifacts. Details
of the improved method can be found in Appendix A.

In the second step, structures are identiﬁed from the size map.
Properties such as masses and sizes are evaluated. This informa-
tion is then used to construct a 3D volume density map. Kainu-
lainen et al. (2014) used the algorithm “clumpﬁnd” (Williams et al.
1994) to detect structures. Masses and sizes of these structures are
estimated. By assuming that they are 3D ellipsoids, a 3D volume
density map can be reconstructed. In the formalism of Kainulainen
et al. (2014), the ellipsoids have sharp boundaries. These artiﬁcial
boundaries do not aﬀect the volume density PDF, but are not de-
sirable for other applications. To overcome this diﬃculty, we have
implemented a contour-based algorithm to reduce the artifacts pro-
duced at the boundaries of the ellipsoids. The details of the algo-
rithm can be found in Appendix B. The improved algorithm pro-
duces new data sets that are better for general-purpose analysis. In
Fig. 2 we present a volume rendering of the reconstructed 3D vol-
ume density map of the Orion A molecular cloud.

The gravitational potential is computed by solving the Poisson
Equation ∇2φ = 4πGρ. It can be solved eﬃciently in the Fourier
space according to

where φk and ρk are the Fourier transforms of φ(x, y, z) and ρ(x, y, z)
respectively.

Computing gravitational potentials in the Fourier space au-
tomatically assumes that the boundary condition is periodic. To
minimize the eﬀects of this limitation on our results, zero den-
sity paddings were added to the 3D volume density map before
the computation. Note also that molecular clouds are never isolated
but part of an inter-connected network of molecular structures that
might aﬀect the clouds gravitationally. More work will be required
in order to quantify this eﬀect on the cloud dynamics. The volume
density map after the padding procedure has a size of (N, N, N)

5 DERIVING THE GRAVITATIONAL ENERGY

SPECTRA

The importance of determining the gravitational energy at diﬀerent
physical scales has been discussed in Li et al. (2016), where they
also deﬁned the so-called multi-scale gravitational energy spectrum
– a measure that quantiﬁes the importance of gravity over multiple
physical scales. In this work, we evaluate the gravitational energy
spectra from observational data.

We employ a two step approach. First, we use the wavelet
transform a trous (see e.g. Starck et al. 1998) to decompose
the gravitational potential φ into components of diﬀerent physical
scales φl (where l denotes the characteristic length scale of a par-

ticular wavelet component):

φl(x, y, z) + R(x, y, z) ,

l

where l represents the physical scale. li = 2i where i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n.
R(x, y, z) is the residual.

For each 3D gravitational potential map of size (Nx, Ny, Nz),
we added zero paddings around the map so that a new map is cre-
ated with a size (N, N, N) where N = max(Nx, Ny, Nz) is created.
The minimum physical scale is the map resolution, and the maxi-
mum physical scale is determined by l = 2n < N/2.

Ep(k) contains the information how the gravitational energy
of a molecular cloud is distributed among diﬀerent physical scales.
It is formulated in exactly the same form as the turbulence power
spectra. By comparing Ep(k) with the turbulence power spectra one
can evaluate the relative importance of turbulence and gravity at
diﬀerent physical scales.

6 RESULTS

Lombardi et al. (2014) found that the Orion A and Orion B molec-
ular clouds have diﬀerent scaling exponents of the surface den-
sity PDFs, implying that they are probably at diﬀerent evolutionary
stages. In this work, we treat them as diﬀerent objects, and study
their gravitational energy spectra separately.

the spatial distribution of the gravitational binding energy that be-

wavelet components of the gravitational potential of the Orion A
molecular cloud. When l is small, the gravitational binding energy
comes from highly ﬁlamentary, thin gas structures in the cloud; and

when l is large, the gravitational binding energy is contributed from
a smoother distribution.

The gravitational energy spectra of the Orion A and Orion B
molecular clouds are presented in Figs. 5, ??, respectively. For both
clouds, the gravitational energy spectra exhibit power law forms.
The scaling exponents are close to 2. We ﬁtted power laws to these
gravitational energy spectra by taking all the measurements with
l (cid:46) 1pc. For Orion A we ﬁnd Ep(k) ∼ k−1.88 and for Orion B
Ep(k) ∼ k−2.09. A stepper slope means energy decreases faster with
decreasing length scales. Thus, on average, the Orion A molecu-
lar cloud has more gravitational energy per unit wavenumber on
smaller scales as compared to Orion B.

On the large scale, within observational uncertainties, molec-
ular clouds can be considered as being gravitationally bound. On
the largest scale, molecular clouds are close to being gravitational
bound (Roman-Duval et al. 2010; Heyer et al. 2009), and the
amount of turbulent energy is comparable to the gravitational bind-
ing energy. Many of the clumps in the clouds are also in appar-
ent virial equilibrium (Wienen et al. 2012). Li et al. (2015) have
demonstrated that by carefully choosing the boundaries of the re-
gions and applying the standard virial analysis, the cloud is much
more gravitationally bound than previously thought. Accretion has
been considered as a primary source that drives turbulence in the
cloud (Klessen & Hennebelle 2010). It this is the case, then one
does not expect clouds to deviate from the virial equilibrium by
much. Recently simulations also indicate that the gravitational col-
lapse is enough to explain the observed level of turbulent motion
(Ibáñez-Mejía et al. 2015). Thus, we assume that the gas is gravita-
tional bound on the cloud scale.

The scaling exponent of the gravitational energy spectra can
be compared with the kinetic energy spectra of Burgers turbulence.
For Kolmogorov turbulence Eturb(k) ∼ k−5/3 and for Burgers tur-
bulence Eturb(k) ∼ k−2. The turbulence in molecular cloud is be-
lieved to be closer to Burgers (Federrath et al. 2008). Here, for both
clouds, the scaling exponents of the gravitational energy spectra
are indeed close to the turbulent kinematic energy spectra. Thus,
if on the large scale, turbulence and gravity can reach rough equi-
librium, then at any smaller scales gravitational energy is at least
comparable to the energy from the turbulent cascade. For the Orion
A molecular cloud, the gravitational energy spectrum is shallower
than Burgers. At sub-parsec scale the gravitational energy should
should therefore become more important than turbulence, and dom-
inate the cloud evolution.

Li & Burkert (2016) gave an analytical expression, allowing
one to infer the gravitational energy spectrum from the observed
surface density PDF of the clouds. Based on observations of Lom-
bardi et al. (2015), they derived the scaling exponents of the gravi-
tational energy spectra for both clouds. Here, we compare the grav-
itational energy spectra derived using our wavelet-based analysis
with those derived using the observational-analytical approach in
Li et al. (2016). The results are summarised in Table 1. The scal-
ing exponents derived from observations are in excellent agreement
with those derived from the surface density PDFs using the analyt-
ical formula, to an accuracy of (cid:46) 10 %, suggesting that the formal-
ism developed in Li & Burkert (2016) does capture the essential
features of the cloud that are necessary for a proper evaluation of
Ep(k).

7 COMPARISON WITH NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

It is believed that turbulence plays a crucial role in molecular cloud
evolution (Kritsuk et al. 2007; Padoan & Nordlund 2011; Krumholz
& McKee 2005; Moeckel & Burkert 2015). Many numerical sim-
ulations of star formation are based on initial conditions that are
generated from a turbulent box. It is helpful to derive the gravita-
tional energy spectra of such a box, and understand the eﬀect of
gravity on the subsequent cloud evolution.

We achieve this using numerical simulations described in Fed-
errath et al. (2010). This also helps us to evaluate the eﬀect of the
volume density reconstruction process (in Sec. 3) on the resulting
gravitational energy spectra.

The simulations of Federrath et al. (2010) are avaliable
at
http://starformat.obspm.fr/starformat/project/
TURB_BOX. We used the simulation with compressible forcing with
Mach number M = 5.6. The snapshot was taken at t = 5T. The
simulation is rescaled to a mean H2 density of 103, a sound speed
of 0.5 km/s, and a size of 10 pc. A clump of ∼ 1 pc in size was
separated from the simulation box.

We then computed the gravitational energy spectrum of this
turbulent ﬂow, the results are presented in Fig. 6. The gravitational
energy spectra of the simulation can be described by E ∼ k−2.57,
steeper than what is seen in our observations, but a similar to that
of the California molecular cloud (see Li et al. 2016). For clouds
like the California molecular cloud, perhaps turbulence can bal-
ance gravity. But for clouds like those seen in the Orion complex,
the cloud structure diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the structures seen in
a typical turbulent box, suggesting that gravity is playing a role that
is more important that what one would expect from typical turbu-
lence simulations. Here, for illustrative reasons, we focused on the
gravitational energy spectrum of a clump in a Mach 5.6 turbulent
box. A detailed parameter study is planned planned, and will be
presented in a subsequent paper.

The simulation also allows us to evaluate the eﬀect of density
reconstruction process on the derived gravitational energy spectra.
We compare the gravitational energy spectrum computed directly
from the simulation with the spectrum, computed based on 3D re-
constructions of the 2D projected density distribution. The gravita-
tional spectra from the simulation and from the simulated observa-
tion exhibit a high degree of resemblance. The gravitational energy
spectrum extracted from the simulation is E ∼ k−2.57, and the grav-
itational energy spectrum extracted from the simulated observation
is E ∼ k−2.43. The diﬀerence in scaling exponents is around 5%.

8 CONCLUSIONS

Gravity plays an important role in the evolution of the molecular
ISM. In a previous work, we proposed a measure called gravita-
tional energy spectrum to quantify the importance of gravity on

multiple physical scales. In this work, using a wavelet-based de-
composition technique, we derived gravitational energy spectrum
of the Orion A and the Orion B molecular cloud. These energy
spectra cover the range from 0.1 pc to 10 pc, and provide con-
straints on the importance of gravity on these scales.

It is found that gravitational energy spectra have power law-
like shapes. At sub-parsec scale, the Orion A molecular cloud has
Ep(k) ∼ k−1.88 and Orion B has Ep(k) ∼ k−2.09. These scaling expo-
nents agree with our earlier analytical estimates (Li et al. 2016) to
an accuracy of 10 %. The fact that these scaling exponents are close
to the exponents of the kinetic energy power spectra of turbulence
(where Ep ∼ k−2) provides a clear evidence that gravity is able
to counteract eﬀectively with the kinetic pressure from the cloud
scale down to ∼ 0.1 pc scale. For the Orion A molecular cloud, if
the cloud as a whole is close to being gravitationally bound, gravity
inevitably dominates over turbulence inside the cloud. In contrast

to this, a simulation with a Mach 5.6 compressible turbulence box
has Ep ∼ k−2.43, which is signiﬁcantly steeper that of both clouds in
the Orion complex.

Our work provides a ﬁrst clear observational proof that grav-
ity is playing an important role in the evolution of turbulent star-
forming molecular clouds form the cloud scale down to ∼ 0.1 pc.
It also suggests that the dynamics of star-forming molecular clouds
could better be described by the hierarchical gravitational collapse
model (Hoyle 1953; Elmegreen 1993; Vázquez-Semadeni et al.
2003; Burkert & Hartmann 2013, 2004) where the collapse is un-
aﬀected by turbulence cascade from the large scale. Application of
the technique to diﬀerent numerical simulations will help to clarify
this issue, and are planned as our future work.

We note, however, that in general molecular clouds have di-
verse structures. Seen from the perspective of the gravitational en-
ergy spectrum, for clouds like Orion A and Orion B, gravity is

cloud, turbulence can still be dominate (Li et al. 2016).

APPENDIX A: MULTI-SCALE DECOMPOSITION OF
THE SURFACE DENSITY MAP

Kainulainen et al. (2014) proposed to decompose the surface den-
sity maps into contributions from structures at diﬀerent physical
scales using the a trous wavelet transform, in order to construct
the so-called size map. This can be implemented as a series of
convolution and subtraction operations. For casual purposes, this
approach can provide reasonable results. However, wavelet trans-
forms are known to produce negative artifacts when the input data
is not suﬃciently smooth and regular. We ﬁrst tried to decompose
the Herschel-Planck surface density map of Orion A, and found that
these negative artifacts contain a signiﬁcant fraction (∼ 20 %) of the

MNRAS 000, 1–?? (2015)

total mass. The articacts are particular pronounced around struc-
tures where the column densities are signiﬁcantly enhanced (e.g.
around the cores). We thus developed a new iterative algorithm to
decompose the emission map into contributions from structures at
diﬀerent physical scales.

The details of the new method will be presented elsewhere.
Here, we describe its implementation brieﬂy. The method works by
recursively removes signiﬁcant structures at diﬀerent resolutions.
For each map, the resolution of interest starts from the pixel size to
about half of the map size. The coarser resolution is always twice
the ﬁnner resolution. The procedure starts with the ﬁnest resolution.
For a given resolution level l = 2k (k = 0, 1, 2, , . . .), the
emission map I(x, y) is smoothed with a Gaussian kernel whose
size (measured in σ) is 2 times of the current resolution, yielding
Ism(x, y). Then signiﬁcant structures are identiﬁed as those where
(I(x, y) − Ism(x, y))/Ism(x, y) is larger than a given threshold. We
experimented with diﬀerent thresholds, and found that a thresh-
old of 2 gives reasonable results. A change of the threshold does
not change the results signiﬁcantly. These signiﬁcant structures are
stored as a separate array (Il(x, y), where l represents the current
resolution), and are subtracted from the map I(x, y). This process is
repeated until all the signiﬁcant structures have been removed from

measurements. The x-axis is the wave number k = 2π/l, l is the length scale, and the y-axis is the energy spectra. Ep(k) ∼ k−2.17 (dashed curve, superimposed

I(x, y) and stored in the array Il(x, y). Afterwards, the subtracted
emission map contains structures that are (cid:38) 2 times the current res-
olution. This residual map is smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with
ensuring that it is suﬃciently smooth at the next resolution level,
and is passed to the next level of resolution where l = 2k+1.

In Fig. A1 we present the size map of the Orion A molecular
cloud produced with our recursive algorithm. Diﬀerent from the
wavelet-based decomposition theme, the new algorithm does not
produce any negative artifacts.

APPENDIX B: CONTOUR-BASED VOLUME
MODELLING

In Kainulainen et al. (2014), after decomposing the input density
map into contributions from diﬀerent sizes, the clumpﬁnd algo-
rithm was used to identify structures that are later used in recon-
structing a 3D density distributions (this step was originally named
as “volume modelling” by these authors). However, in their original
formalism, the structures are identiﬁed by the clumpﬁnd algorithm
(Williams et al. 1994), and were treated as ellipsoids. This intro-
duced sharp edges to the resulting 3D volume density map.

These discontinuities are highly undesirable for our purposes.
We therefore improved the method using a new contour-based map
splitting technique.

Our improved method for volume modelling is described as

follows:

First, using the method described in Appendix. A, we decom-
pose the surface density map into components of diﬀerent sizes
Il(x, y).
For a surface density map Il(x, y) representing emission con-
tributed from structures of sizes ∼ l, we start from maximum sur-
face density as a threshold, identify the signiﬁcant structures above
this threshold, register them in a catalogue, remove these struc-
tures from the emission, and then further decrease the threshold
to include less signiﬁcant structures. This continues until a mini-
mum level is reached. In our calculations, the minimum level above
which structures are considered to be signiﬁcant is set to be 5 % of
the maximum level, and for each map we choose 50 equally-spaced
contour levels.

For each of the identiﬁed structure, its extent along the line of
sight is estimated by diagonalizing the tensors of the second mo-
ments of the pixel positions. A 3D density distribution is recon-
structed from all the identiﬁed structures based positions of pixels

on the 2D sky plane and the estimated extent along the third di-
mension. During the reconstruction, positions of the structures on
the (x, y) plane are determined by the positions of all the enclosed
pixels, and the mass distributions along the z direction are modelled
by assuming that they follow Gaussian proﬁles where σ is equal to
the estimated extent along the third dimension.

For regions like the Orion A, around 104 structures are identi-
ﬁed and folded into 3D to reconstruct the volume density map. The
reconstructed volume density map is in general very smooth.
