We present a general method to obtain the exact rate function Ψ[a,b](k) controlling the large deviation proba-
bility Prob[IN [a, b] = kN ] (cid:16) e−N Ψ[a,b](k) that a N×N sparse random matrix has IN [a, b] = kN eigenvalues
inside the interval [a, b]. The method is applied to study the eigenvalue statistics in two distinct examples: (i) the
shifted index number of eigenvalues for an ensemble of Erd¨os-R´enyi graphs and (ii) the number of eigenvalues
within a bounded region of the spectrum for the Anderson model on regular random graphs. A salient feature
of the rate function in both cases is that, unlike rotationally invariant random matrices, it is asymmetric with
respect to its minimum. The asymmetric character depends on the disorder in a way that is compatible with the
distinct eigenvalue statistics corresponding to localized and delocalized eigenstates. The results also show that
N ∝ N (N (cid:29) 1) for any nonzero
the number variance σ2
disorder, which is consistent with the absence of level-repulsion in the extended phase. Our theoretical ﬁndings
are thoroughly compared to numerical diagonalization in both cases, showing a reasonable good agreement.

N for the Anderson model on a regular graph scales as σ2

Since the fundamental works of Wigner [1] and Dyson [2–
4] that lay the foundations of random matrix theory, several
observables related to the eigenvalue statistics of N × N
random matrices have been studied and a wealth of quanti-
tative information is currently available, constituting an in-
valuable tool to address problems in various disciplines [5].
A primary observable is the number of eigenvalues IN [a, b]
within a bounded interval [a, b] on the real line. The statistics
of IN [a, b] describes the ground-state ﬂuctuations of many-
body fermionic systems [6, 7], whose experimental realiza-
tion may be achieved by conﬁning cold atoms in optical laser
traps [8]. From a more theoretical perspective, the ﬂuctuations
of IN [a, b] provide a criterion to distinguish between the lo-
calized and the extended phase in non-interacting disordered
electronic systems [5, 9], due to the striking different behavior
of the eigenvalue statistics in each phase. Several works have
been also devoted to the statistics of the number of eigenvalues
in an unbounded interval (−∞, b] [10–18], which is relevant
to problems in different areas, such as the study of the intri-
cate energy landscape of disordered systems [10, 19, 20], or
the meaningful analysis of the correlation matrix built from
large datasets [13, 17]. All these works deal with rotationally
invariant random matrices (RIRM), where the joint probabil-
ity distribution of eigenvalues is analytically known and the
Coulomb gas method can be readily applied, yielding analyt-
ical results not only for the typical statistical ﬂuctuations of
IN [a, b], but also for its atypical, rare ﬂuctuations, which re-
main ﬁnite in the limit N → ∞.

Although the Coulomb gas method has played a crucial role
in random matrix theory, its application is limited to RIRM.
The statistics of IN [a, b] in other interesting random matrix
ensembles has eluded a careful treatment, as the analytical
form of the joint distribution of eigenvalues is not generally
known. In this sense, the most relevant examples come from
spectral graph theory [21], in which the central interest lies in
the eigenvalue statistics of certain matrices related to sparse
random graphs, deﬁned as a set of N nodes connected ran-

domly by edges. The behavior of the statistical ﬂuctuations
of IN [a, b] is an interesting subject from the theoretical side,
due to the interplay between the distinct statistical properties
of eigenvalues corresponding to localized and extended states,
both usually coexisting in the spectra of random graphs [25–
27, 41, 47]. In the last decade, random graphs have become
a fundamental tool to explore different branches of science,
ﬁnding applications in topics as diverse as complex networks,
spin-glasses and information theory (see [22, 23] and refer-
ences therein). Another important application is the study of
transport properties in disordered electronic systems, where
random graphs give rise to mean-ﬁeld models [24–28]. Mo-
tivated largely by the connection between Anderson localiza-
tion on a regular random graph (RRG) and localization in the
Fock space of many-body quantum systems [29], there has
been a renewed interest in the Anderson model on a RRG due
to the possible existence of a novel, non-ergodic delocalized
phase [28, 30–34], which would be characterized by extended
eigenstates corresponding to uncorrelated energy levels [28].
In spite of this ubiquitousness, analytical techniques to pursue
an in-depth analysis of the eigenvalue ﬂuctuations of random
graphs are still lacking, even in the context of the well-studied
Anderson model on a RRG.

In this paper we introduce a powerful method to compute
analytically the rate function Ψ[a,b](k) describing the large de-
viations that a N × N matrix associated to a random graph
model has IN [a, b] = kN eigenvalues inside [a, b] in the limit
N → ∞. Our approach explores an analogy between spin-
glasses and random matrices by mapping the problem of com-
puting the cumulant generating function of IN [a, b] in a free-
energy calculation reminiscent from spin-glasses, which can
be pursued using the replica method [35]. In order to illus-
trate the general character of our technique, we present results
for two different examples: (i) the large deviation function
of IN (−∞, L] for Erd¨os-R´enyi (ER) random graphs; (ii) the
statistics of IN [−L, L] for the Anderson model on a RRG.
As a common ﬁnding in both examples, the large deviation

function of IN is asymmetric with respect to its minimum, in
contrast to its symmetric nature in the case of RIRM. We ar-
gue that the asymmetry of Ψ[a,b](k) comes from the presence
of both localized and extended states in the spectra of ran-
dom graphs. As another outcome of the method, our results
strongly indicate that, for large N, the variance of IN [−L, L]
for the Anderson model on a RRG scales linearly with N for
any nonzero disorder strength, which complies with the ab-
sence of strong level repulsion, supporting the non-ergodic
nature of the whole extended phase [30]. All results are com-
pared with numerical diagonalization of large random matri-
ces, showing a fairly good agreement.
Let us consider an N × N symmetric real matrix H with
eigenvalues λ = (λ1, . . . , λN ), where IN [a, b] denotes the
number of eigenvalues inside the interval [a, b] ⊆ R.

From large deviation theory we have that Prob[IN [a, b] =

function [36]. This quantity is related to the cumulant gen-
erating function F[a,b](y) by the Legendre transform

Thus, the cumulant generating function is the central object of
interest, since the computation of Ψ[a,b](k) and κ(cid:96)[a, b] boils
down to being able to calculate F[a,b](y).
Fortunately, the derivation of F[a,b](y) can be carried out
exactly in the thermodynamic limit using spin glass tech-
niques [35]. We describe the generalities of the method here
and provide the ﬁnal results of the derivation for two explicit
models of sparse random graphs. According to eqs. (4) and
(5), F[a,b](y) is obtained from the ensemble average of real
powers of Z(z), which is an unworkable calculation. In order
to overcome this obstacle, one employs the replica method as
discussed in [37], by rewriting eq. (5) as follows

(cid:68)(cid:2)Z(b(cid:63)

the replica space, that is Q[aη,bη](n±) ∼ (cid:82) D[σ]e

where n± are two positive integers. The ensemble average
can then be carried out, after which one is left with an ex-
pression for Q in terms of a path integral over a function σ in
−NAn± [σ].
The precise form of the functional An± [σ] depends, among
other things, on the speciﬁc ensemble of random matrices un-
der scrutiny. In the limit N → ∞, the path integral is eval-
uated by the saddle-point method and the analytical contin-
uation n± → ± iy
π can be performed after assuming a suit-
able replica symmetric (RS) ansatz for the order-parameter
σ [38, 39]. Deﬁning A[aη,bη](n±, ω) as the functional A at
the RS saddle-point, the cumulant generating function follows
from eq. (4)

F[a,b](y) = lim
η→0+

π

A[aη,bη](n±, ω) ,

(9)

where ω denotes a distribution arising from the RS assumption
for the saddle-point. Importantly, since the replica limit is not
taken to zero, as usual in the replica approach [38, 39], one
is left with standard self-consistent equations for ω [37, 38,
40, 41], but with a reweighting factor. This is not a problem,
as it is possible to use a weighted population dynamics [42]
to solve numerically that equation. The details of the replica
approach to compute Q[aη,bη](n±) are discussed in [37].

In order to illustrate the versatility of our approach, we
present results for two different examples: (i) the number of
eigenvalues that lie inside the interval (−∞, L], also known
as the shifted index number (SIN), in the case of Erd¨os-
R´enyi (ER) random graphs [43]; (ii) the number of eigenval-
ues within the box [−L, L] for the Anderson model on a RRG
[44]. The elements Hij of the associated N × N random ma-
trix H for both models are given by Hij = iδij + cijJij,
where the diagonal {i} and the off-diagonal {Jij} elements
are independent random variables drawn from the distribu-
tions P() and PJ (J), respectively. The structure of the ran-
dom graph is encoded in the entries {cij} of the underlying
adjacency matrix [43]: cij = 1 if nodes i and j are connected,
and cij = 0 otherwise. In the case of ER graphs, the variables

{cij} are distributed according to

with c denoting the so called average connectivity. The adja-
cency matrix of RRG can be also deﬁned through eq. (10),
with the additional constraint that each node is connected to
a ﬁxed number c of neighbors [37]. The sparse nature is en-
coded in the parameter c, which remains of O(1) as N → ∞.
In the case of the Anderson model, the random variables {i}
are on-site potentials, while {Jij} denote the hopping energies
between adjacent nodes [24].

L (k) and Ψ(a)

As the factor e
π θ(u) plays a role of reweighting term in eqs.
(17) and (18), these can be solved numerically by a weighted
population dynamics algorithm [42]. The subsequent numeri-
cal solutions can then be used to evaluate the cumulant gener-
ating functions (11) and (12) for different values of y, and the
corresponding large-deviation functions Ψ(p)
L (k)
follow simply from the transform (6). The easier way to pro-
ceed is to compute k = ∂F (p,a)
(y)/∂y for some ﬁxed y and
then plot the rate functions parametrically by varying y. For
y = 0, the reweighting factors do not play any role and eqs.
(17) and (18) have a standard form, already found in similar
problems [37, 38, 40, 41]. The details of the weighted popu-
lation dynamics algorithm will be presented elsewhere [45].
L (k) of the SIN in
the case of ER graphs with ﬁxed edges Jij = 1 and absent
diagonal disorder. The large deviation function for average
connectivity c = 3 is presented in the main panel of ﬁgure
1, in which we compare the results obtained from population
dynamics with those coming from numerical diagonalization.
Since the probability of observing IN (−∞, L] = kN be-

Firstly we consider the rate function Ψ(p)

FIG. 1. Rate function Ψ(p)
L (k) of the number of eigenvalues inside
the interval (−∞, L], with L = −1, in the case of Erd¨os-R´enyi
graphs with average connectivity c = 3. The solid-ﬁlled sym-
bols are results derived through population dynamics, while the un-
ﬁlled symbols correspond to numerical diagonalization of matrices
of sizes N = 50 (yellow pentagons), N = 100 (orange rhombic
symbols) and N = 300 (dark-red triangles), using ensembles with
Nsamples = 7 × 109, Nsamples = 6 × 108 and Nsamples = 2 × 108
samples, respectively.

The effect of the average connectivity on Ψ(p)

haves as e−N Ψ(p)
L (k) for large N, there is a compromise be-
tween considering larger and larger N to suppress ﬁnite size
effects while at the same time exploring a sizeable subinterval
of values of k ∈ [0, 1]. In spite of these difﬁculties, the numer-
ical diagonalization results exhibit the correct trend in ﬁgure
1, i. e., they approach the theoretical results for increasing N.
L (k) is
illustrated in the inset of ﬁgure 1. A notable feature
of the rate function is its asymmetry around the posi-
tion of its minimum, located at the typical value ktyp =
limN→∞ (cid:104)IN (−∞, L](cid:105) /N. This is at odds to the behav-
ior of the rate functions describing the eigenvalue statistics
in RIRM [6, 11–18], but consistent with the gradual change
of the eigenvalue statistical properties as c increases [25, 26].
For c < 1, the graph is composed of ﬁnite, disconnected clus-
ters, and all eigenvectors are localized [26, 46], while a giant
cluster emerges at c ≥ 1, with the spectrum presenting a mo-
bility edge that separates localized and extended eigenstates
[41, 46, 47]. Level repulsion between neighboring eigenval-
ues is stronger for c ≥ 1 and, accordingly, samples that in-
crease the SIN become less probable, resulting in rate func-
tions that grow faster for k > ktyp when compared to the
left branch k < ktyp. Since the probability of ﬁnding discon-
nected clusters decreases exponentially as a function of c [48],
Ψ(p)
L (k) becomes gradually more symmetric for increasing c,
consistently with the rate functions in RIRM [6, 11–18].
Next we consider the fraction of eigenvalues that lie within
the interval [−L, L] for the Anderson model on a RRG, with
ﬁxed edges Jij = 1 and on-site random potentials uniformly
distributed in [−W/2, W/2]. The statistics of this quantity
depends on how L scales with N when approaching the band
edge λedge [6]. Here we limit ourselves to the bulk regime,
in the sense that 1/N (cid:28) L < λedge [6]. The main graph
of ﬁgure 2 shows the reasonable accordance of our theoret-
ical results for Ψ(a)
L (k) with those derived through numeri-
cal diagonalization of an ensemble of graphs with c = 3 and
W = 4. As shown in the inset of ﬁgure 2, the asymmetric
nature of Ψ(a)
L (k) changes as a function of W , qualitatively
similar to the results for ER graphs. One expects that repul-
sion between neighboring levels becomes more prominent for
smaller W , which makes the ﬂuctuations that tend to raise
IN [−L, L] rarer. For W > Wc (cid:39) 17.5, all eigenstates are
localized and the level-spacing distribution follows a Poisson
law [24, 27, 28], with the rate function approaching that of a
binomial distribution for W → ∞ [45].
We ﬁnish by presenting results for the second cumulant κ2
of IN [−L, L] for the Anderson model on a RRG. From eq.
N(cid:105) − (cid:104)IN(cid:105)2
(7), we have that κ2 = σ2
is the number variance [6, 9]. Similarly to reference [37], an
equation for κ2 is obtained from the second derivative of eq.
(12) with respect to y, which can be evaluated using the pop-
ulation dynamics method. The explicit expressions for κ1 and
κ2 will be presented elsewhere [45]. The number variance al-
lows to distinguish between the statistics of uncorrelated ran-
dom eigenvalues, where σ2
N = O(N ), and the statistics of a

N /N, where σ2

N = (cid:104)I 2

FIG. 2. Population dynamics results for the rate function Ψ(a)
L (k) of
the fraction of eigenvalues inside the interval [−L, L] for the Ander-
son model on a regular random graph with ﬁxed connectivity c = 3,
L = 1 and different disorder strengths W . The dark-red triangles
and orange rhombic symbols correspond to the numerical diagonal-
ization of matrices of sizes N = 40 and N = 100, respectively. The
ensembles consist of Nsamples = 6 × 109 samples for N = 40 and
Nsamples = 2 × 109 samples for N = 100. The solid red line on the
inset is the rate function of a binomial distribution, where 2L/W is
the probability that an eigenvalue falls into [−L, L].

rigid spectrum, where neighboring eigenvalues strongly repel
each other, yielding the scaling σ2

N = O(ln N ) [9].

In ﬁgure 3 we present population dynamics results for κ2
as a function of W , for ﬁxed connectivity c = 3 and different
sizes L of the box, together with numerical diagonalization
results. The second cumulant displays a non-monotonic be-
havior, with a maximum close to the critical value Wc (cid:39) 17.5
for the localization transition. More interestingly, κ2 seems to
vanish strictly at W = 0 and, consequently, the number vari-
ance scales linearly with N for any ﬁnite disorder. This result
contrasts with the standard behavior of extended eigenstates
in RIRM, where κ2 = 0 due to the strong level-repulsion
between neighboring eigenvalues [6]. We point out that our
results for κ2 are free of ﬁnite size effects, as they arise from
the solution of eqs. (15) and (18), valid in the limit N → ∞.
We have presented an exact method to obtain, in the limit
N → ∞, the large deviation function controlling the ﬂuctua-
tions of the number of eigenvalues IN [a, b] inside an interval
[a, b] for sparse random matrices. Our approach is very gen-
eral in three different aspects: it allows to handle (i) bounded
and unbounded intervals [a, b]; (ii) different matrices deﬁned
on graphs, such as the Laplacian and the adjacency matrix
[21]; (iii) distinct random graph models, important in appli-
cations [23]. Moreover, our method can be easily extended
to consider similar statistic in a set of disjoint intervals. This
versatile character opens the possibility to study typical and
atypical eigenvalue ﬂuctuations in important models to sev-
eral areas. We have applied the technique to two cases and
have compared our analytical ﬁndings with results from nu-
merical diagonalization, obtaining a fairly good agreement.

A notable property of the rate function in both random

the replica method, the cavity approach should provide the
rate function for a single graph instance. Work along some of
these lines is underway [45].

FIG. 3. Results of populations dynamics (solid lines) for the sec-
ond cumulant κ2(W ) of the number of eigenvalues within the box
[−L, L] for the Anderson model on a regular random graph with
ﬁxed connectivity c = 3 and for L = 1/2 (blue), L = 1 (yellow)
and L = 2 (green). These are compared with results from numerical
diagonalization (symbols) for matrices of size N = 1000 and aver-
age over 5 × 103 samples, for L = 1/2 and L = 1, and over 104
samples for L = 2.

graph models considered here is its asymmetry around the
minimum, showing that deviations increasing or decreasing
IN [a, b] with respect to its typical value are of a rather differ-
ent nature. Overall, the asymmetry seems to depend on the
strength of the level-repulsion between neighboring eigenval-
ues, which should reﬂect decisively on the spectral ﬂuctua-
tions. We expect to unveil such asymmetry by disentangling
the contributions for the rate function coming from the dis-
crete and continuous parts of the spectrum [49]. In principle,
our method also allows to obtain all cumulants of IN [a, b].
We have computed the second cumulant κ2 for the Anderson
model on a RRG and the results suggest that κ2 > 0 for any
ﬁnite disorder. Although this is strikingly different from the
delocalized eigenstates of RIRM, in which one has κ2 = 0,
our results are consistent with the recently proposed scenario
of the non-ergodic nature of the entire extended phase in the
Anderson model on a RRG [30].

Finally, there are still a number of questions that need to be
addressed, both from the numerical and the theoretical point
of view. First of all, the weighted population dynamics en-
counters a numerical bottleneck when |y| (cid:29) 1, since the
weight factor becomes either too large or too small (see eqs.
(17) and (18)). Although the extent of this numerical difﬁculty
depends on the model at hand, more efﬁcient implementations
of population dynamics would be more than welcome. For
an homogeneous RRG without diagonal disorder, eq. (9) van-
ishes and one needs to take into account ﬁnite-size corrections
to the saddle-point integral in order to obtain the rate function.
A similar situation arises when one studies the typical index
ﬂuctuations of Gaussian random matrices using the replica ap-
proach [10, 50]. On the methodological perspective, a deriva-
tion of the rate function using the cavity method would be very
interesting. Besides being conceptually more transparent than
