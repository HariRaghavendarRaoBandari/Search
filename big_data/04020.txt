Abstract—In this paper, we experimentally investigate the
statistical distribution of intensity ﬂuctuations for underwater
wireless optical channels under different channel conditions,
namely fresh and salty underwater channels with and without air
bubbles. To do so, we ﬁrst measure the received optical signal with
a large number of samples. Based on the normalized acquired
data the channel coherence time and the ﬂuctuations probabil-
ity density function (PDF) are obtained for different channel
scenarios. Our experimental results show that salt attenuates the
received signal while air bubbles mainly introduce severe intensity
ﬂuctuations. Moreover, we observe that log-normal distribution
I )
precisely ﬁts the acquired data PDF for scintillation index (σ2
values less than 0.1, while Gamma-Gamma and K distributions
I > 1. Since neither
aptly predict the intensity ﬂuctuations for σ2
of these distributions are capable of predicting the received
I < 1, we propose a combination of an
irradiance for 0.1 < σ2
exponential and a log-normal distributions to perfectly describe
the acquired data PDF for such regimes of scintillation index.

herence time.

I. INTRODUCTION

The ever increasing demand for more secure, ecosystem
friendly and broadband underwater communication and ex-
ploration necessitates comprehensive studies on underwater
wireless optical communication (UWOC). Compared to its tra-
ditional counterpart, namely acoustic communication, UWOC
provides better security, lower time delay and higher band-
width [1], and is more compatible with underwater ecosystem.
Despite all these, propagation of light under water is affected
by three main degrading effects, namely absorption, scattering
and turbulence, which limit the viable communication ranges
of UWOC systems to typically less than 100 m.

In recent years, many valuable researches have been carried
out in the context of UWOC, from channel modeling to system
design. In [1]–[3] Petzold’s experimental data [4], [5] are
used to simulate the UWOC channel impulse response through
Monte Carlo numerical method. However, these prior works
only focused on the absorption and scattering effects of the
channel, many relevant studies have been performed on the
turbulence characterization. For example, in [6] an accurate
power spectrum has been derived for ﬂuctuations of turbulent
seawater refractive index. Rytov method has been used in [7]
to evaluate the scintillation index of optical plane and spherical
waves propagating in underwater turbulent medium. And in
[8], the on-axis scintillation index of a focused Gaussian beam
is formulated for weak oceanic turbulence and log-normal
distribution is considered for intensity ﬂuctuations to evaluate
the average bit error rate (BER) in such systems.

On the other hand, a cellular topology based on optical
code division multiple access (OCDMA) technique has been
recently proposed in [9] for underwater wireless optical net-
works, while the potential challenges and applications of such
a network is discussed in [10]. Besides, beneﬁcial applications
of multi-hop transmission (serial relaying) on the up-and
downlink performance of underwater users in an OCDMA
network and also in point-to-point UWOC links have been
investigated in [11] and [12], respectively, with respect to all
the degrading effects of UWOC channels. Furthermore, the
authors in [13], [14] have focused on the turbulence-induced
fading effects of UWOC channels and proposed multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) transmission to mitigate turbulence
effects through spatial diversity gain of MIMO technique.

Although,

the statistical distribution of fading for free-
space optical (FSO) channels is thoroughly investigated and
characterized [15]–[17], its probability density function (PDF)
for UWOC channels is not yet well determined. Prior works
on the context of UWOC mainly focused on weak oceanic
turbulence and adopted the same statistical distribution as
FSO channels, i.e., log-normal distribution for this regime
of underwater turbulence [8], [18], [19]. However, signiﬁcant
differences between the nature of atmospheric and oceanic
optical channels may result in a different PDF for underwater
fading statistics. The research in this paper is inspired by
the need to more speciﬁcally study the intensity ﬂuctuations
through UWOC channels. In this paper, we experimentally
investigate the effect of various phenomena on the ﬂuctuations
of the received optical signal within a laboratory water tank.
Since the severity of optical turbulence rapidly increases with
the link range, the short link range available with a labora-
tory water tank may typically result negligible ﬂuctuations
on the received optical signal. Therefore, at the ﬁrst step,
we artiﬁcially add air bubbles in our water tank to enlarge
the channel’s temporal ﬂuctuations. Then, for each channel
condition, we take sufﬁcient samples from the received optical
signal, normalize them to the received power mean, and
plot the normalized samples histogram to obtain the intensity
ﬂuctuations’ distribution and the channel coherence time; the
time period in which the channel fading coefﬁcient remains
approximately constant. It is worth mentioning that since many
of underwater vehicles, divers and submarines generate air
bubbles, study on the intensity ﬂuctuations due to the presence
of air bubbles has signiﬁcant importance in precise UWOC
channel modeling and system design.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II
the UWOC channel model is presented. The used evaluation

metrics, and general statistical distributions for optical turbu-
lence are brieﬂy described in Sections III and IV, respectively.
Section V provides the system model and experimental set up,
Section VI presents experimental results for various scenarios
and Section VII concludes the paper.

II. UWOC CHANNEL DESCRIPTION

Propagation of light under water is affected by three major
degrading effects, i.e., absorption, scattering and turbulence. In
fact, photons of a propagating light wave may encounter with
water molecules and particles. During this collision, energy
of each photon may be lost thermally, which is speciﬁed as
absorption process and is characterized by absorption coefﬁ-
cient a(λ), where λ is the wavelength of the propagating light
wave. Furthermore, in the aforementioned collision process
direction of each photon may be changed that is deﬁned as
scattering process and is determined by scattering coefﬁcient
b(λ). Besides,
total energy loss of non-scattered light
is
described by extinction coefﬁcient c(λ) = a(λ) + b(λ) [5].

The channel fading-free impulse response (FFIR), h0(t),
can be obtained through Monte Carlo simulations similar to
[1]–[3]. Although, this FFIR includes both absorption and scat-
tering effects, comprehensive characterization of the UWOC
channel
impulse response requires fading consideration as
well. To do so, the channel FFIR can be multiplied by a fading
coefﬁcient [13], [16]. However,
log-normal distribution is
mainly used for fading coefﬁcients’ PDF [8], [11], [13], [18],
inspired by the behaviour of optical turbulence in atmosphere,
an accurate characterization of fading coefﬁcients’ statistical
distribution necessitates more speciﬁc studies, that is carried
out in this paper.

In order to specify the fading strength, it is common in the
literature to deﬁne the scintillation index of a propagating light
wave as [7], [16];

E(cid:2)I 2(r, d0, λ)(cid:3) − E2 [I (r, d0, λ)]

σ2
I (r, d0, λ) =

E2 [I (r, d0, λ)]

,

(1)

in which I(r, d0, λ) is the instantaneous intensity at a point
with position vector (r, d0) = (x, y, d0), where d0 is the
propagation distance and E [I] denotes the expected value of
the random variable (RV) I.

III. EVALUATION METRICS

In order to investigate the UWOC channel’s fading statistic,
we ﬁrst, experimentally measure the channel coherence time
for different channel conditions. To do so, we measure the
time in which the temporal covariance coefﬁcient of irradiance,
deﬁned as Eq. (2), remains approximately constant [16], [20].

bτ,I (d0, τ ) =

Bτ,I (d0, τ )
Bτ,I (d0, 0)

,

(2)

(cid:52)
where Bτ,I (d0, τ )
= BI (r1, d0, t1; r2, d0, t2) with r1 = r2.
Moreover, τ = t1− t2, and BI (r1, d0, t1; r2, d0, t2) is deﬁned
as the covariance of irradiance for two points r1 and r2 at
different time instants t1 and t2.

As the next step of our work, we specify the channel fading
statistical distribution. We use the following two well-known
metrics to evaluate the accordance of different statistical
distributions with the experimental data.

1) Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): This metric de-
termines how well the considered distribution predicts the
experimental data, and is deﬁned as;

RM SE =

(Im,i − Ip,i)2,

(3)

(cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:116) 1

N

N(cid:88)

i=1

where N is the number of measured samples, Im,i is the
measured intensity through the experiment and Ip,i
is the
predicted intensity by the considered distribution.

2) Goodness of Fit: This metric, which is also known as
R2 measure, is used to test the distribution’s ﬁtness and is
expressed as;

(4)

R2 = 1 − SSreg
SStot

,

in which SSreg is the considered distribution’s sum of square
i=1 (fm,i − fp,i)2, where M is the
number of bins of the acquired data histogram, and fm,i and
fp,i are, respectively, the measured and the predicted proba-
bility values for a given received intensity level. And SStot
is the sum of the squares of distances between the measured

errors, i.e., SSreg = (cid:80)M
points and the mean of them, i.e., SStot =(cid:80)M
where ¯f =(cid:80)M

i=1 fm,i/M. As the value of the R2 measure,
for a given distribution, approaches its maximum (i.e., 1), the
distribution is considered to better ﬁt the measured data.

IV. GENERAL STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS USED FOR

OPTICAL TURBULENCE CHARACTERIZATION

For the sake of brevity, we only take into account the fol-
lowing statistical distributions which are widely accepted for
various regimes of atmospheric turbulence [16]. Moreover, we
propose a combined exponential and log-normal distribution
to better characterize the fading statistics for 0.1 < σ2

1) Log-Normal Distribution: Such a distribution is com-
monly used in literature for weak atmospheric turbulence
I < 1. Let ˜h = exp(2X) be the
regime, characterized by σ2
channel fading coefﬁcient (˜h > 0) with log-normal PDF as
[16];

I < 1.

(5)

Therefore, the fading log-amplitude X = 1/2 ln(˜h) has a
Gaussian distribution with mean µX and variance σ2
X. To
ensure that fading neither ampliﬁes nor attenuates the average
power, we normalize fading coefﬁcients such that E[˜h] = 1,
which implies that µX = −σ2
X [16]. It can be shown that for
log-normal fading the log-amplitude variance relates to the
scintillation index as σ2

X = 0.25 ln(1 + σ2

Inﬁniium oscilloscope. For each test, we have collected 32768
samples with the sampling rate of 25 kSa/s. Along with our
setup, an alcohol thermometer is attached to the lower side of
the tank to ensure that the water temperature remains constant
around 20 degrees Celsius. Finally, to produce air bubbles, a
tunable air blower with the maximum blowing capacity of 28
Litre/m is employed. Fig. 1 shows our experimental setup.

VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section, we present our experimental results for the
channel coherence time and the fading statistical distribution,
under various underwater channel conditions. For each sce-
nario we evaluate the validity of different distributions using
the deﬁned metrics in Section III. The considered channel
conditions include free-space link as well as fresh and salty
underwater channels with and without bubbles. For each
scenario, we adjusted the transmitter laser power to ensure
that a considerable power reaches the receiver.

Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) illustrate the received signal through the
free-space and fresh water links, respectively. As it can be
seen, for FSO and UWOC channels with low link ranges (like
our water tank) the received signal is approximately constant
over a large period of time, i.e., fading has a negligible effect
on the performance of low-range FSO and UWOC systems.
As a consequence, the channel impulse response for such
scenarios can be thoroughly described by a deterministic FFIR.
In order to investigate salinity effects on the underwater
optical channels, we added 700 g salt to our water tank. We
observed signiﬁcant loss on the received signal in comparison
to fresh water link. Therefore, we increased the transmitter
power to observe a notable signal at the receiver, and hence to
better investigate the fading ﬂuctuations due to water salinity.
Fig. 2(c) shows the received signal through the salty water. As
it is obvious, water salinity does not impose severe ﬂuctuations
on the propagating signal. We also used a water pump to ﬂow
water within the tank. Our extra experiments indicated that as
the velocity of moving medium increases, the received signal
experiences faster and more severe ﬂuctuations. This is mainly
due to the fact that as the water ﬂow increases, particles within
the water move more rapidly and this causes more randomness
on the transmitting signal path.

According to Figs. 2(a)-(c), due to the low link range
available by the laboratory water tank, the received signal
ﬂuctuations are typically negligible. In other words, optical
turbulence manifests its effect at longer link ranges, i.e., for
UWOC and FSO channels with typically d0 > 10 m and
d0 > 1 km link ranges, respectively [7], [21]. Therefore, an air
compressor is used to produce bubbles and hence to induce a
severe fading on the channel. Figs. 2(d) and 2(e) illustrates the
received signal through the bubbly fresh water, while Fig. 2(f)
shows the same result for the bubbly and salty underwater link.
As it is obvious from these ﬁgures, the presence of bubbles
within the channel causes the received signal
to severely
ﬂuctuate. This is mainly due to the random arrangement
of bubbles encountering the propagating signal across the

1Note that the PD’s generated current i(t) relates to the received optical
power p(t) as i(t) = ηp(t)/hf, where η is the PD’s quantum efﬁciency, h
is the Planck’s constant and f is the light frequency. Moreover, the ampliﬁed
signal is proportional to the PD’s current and hence to the received optical
signal. Therefore, normalized samples of the ampliﬁed photo-detected signal
are good representatives of the received optical power normalized samples.

3) Gamma-Gamma Distribution: Such a statistical model,
which factorizes the irradiance as the product of two indepen-
dent random processes each with a Gamma PDF, has been
introduced in literature to describe both small-scale and large-
scale atmospheric ﬂuctuations. The PDF of Gamma-Gamma
distribution is expressed as [21];

in which α and β are parameters related to effective atmo-
spheric conditions. The scintillation index for Gamma-Gamma
distribution is given by σ2

I = 1/α + 1/β + 1/αβ [21].

4) Proposed Combined Exponential and Log-Normal Distri-
bution: When the received optical signal has a large dynamic
range or equivalently the received signal lies either in large or
small levels, general single-lobe distributions cannot specify
the fading statistical distribution. In such circumstances, a two-
lobe statistical distribution is required to interpret the channel
intensity ﬂuctuations. Therefore, we propose the combination
of an exponential and a log-normal distributions with PDF of;

where, k determines the proportion between the exponential
and the log-normal distributions, γ is the exponential dis-
tribution mean, and µ and σ2 are the constants of the log-
normal distribution. Fading coefﬁcients normalization implies

that E[˜h] = kγ + (1 − k) exp(cid:0)µ + σ2/2(cid:1) = 1. Moreover,
I = 2kγ2 + (1 − k) exp(cid:0)2µ + 2σ2(cid:1) − 1 and E[˜hn] =
kγnn! + (1 − k) exp(cid:0)nµ + n2σ2/2(cid:1), respectively.

the scintillation index and the nth (n is a positive inte-
ger) moment for the above distribution can be obtained as

V. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP DESCRIPTION

Our setup is implemented in a 30× 40× 200 cm3 black col-
ored water tank. In the transmitter side, a 532 nm green laser
diode with the maximum output power of 100 mW is driven
by a MOS transistor to ensure a constant optical irradiance.
In the receiver side, an ultraviolate-visible photodetector (PD)
is used; the PD is covered by a convex outer lens in order to
collect the maximum amount of irradiance. Additionally, both
laser and PD are sealed by placing in transparent boxes. PD’s
generated current
is ampliﬁed through AD840 operational
ampliﬁer. The magniﬁed signal, which is proportional to the

channel conditions2. As it can be seen, for very small values
of scintillation index, i.e., σ2
I < 0.01 log-normal distribution
has an excellent goodness of ﬁt and a negligible RMSE.
However, both log-normal and Gamma-Gamma distributions

a positive quantity, the evaluation of K distribution is only possible when σ2

distribution fails to describe the intensity ﬂuctuations for such
a regime of scintillation index. Fig. 3 better illustrates the
ﬁtness of different statistical distributions with the acquired
data histograms for various channel scenarios. Based on the
summarized results of Table I, neither of the discussed general
statistical distributions are capable of predicting the intensity
ﬂuctuations when 0.1 < σ2
I < 1. As the received intensity
shapes in Figs. 2(d)-(f) and the histograms of the acquired data
in Figs. 3(d)-(f) show the presence of air bubbles causes the
received intensity to mainly lie either in large or small values.
Hence, typical single-lobe distributions cannot appropriately
ﬁt the experimental data and generally a two-lobe statistical
distribution is required. Therefore, we proposed a combined
exponential and log-normal distribution as discussed in Section
IV. As Table I and Fig. 3 illustrate the proposed distribution
excellently ﬁts the acquired experimental data for all
the
regions of scintillation index with an acceptable RMSE.

Fig. 4. Temporal covariance coefﬁcient for various channel scenarios.

Fig. 4 illustrates the temporal covariance coefﬁcient of
irradiance for different scenarios. As it can be seen, even in
strongest fading condition of bubbly channels the aforemen-
tioned coefﬁcient is larger than 10−3 seconds conﬁrming the
ﬂat fading, i.e., the same fading coefﬁcient over thousands up
to millions of consecutive bits. Moreover, this ﬁgure shows
that the channel temporal variation slightly increases with the
increase on the scintillation index value, i.e, the higher the
value of σ2

I , the less the value of bτ,I (d0, τ ).

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we experimentally investigated the statistical
distribution of intensity ﬂuctuations for underwater wireless
optical channels under different channel conditions. Our exper-
imental results showed that salt attenuates the received signal
while air bubbles mainly introduce severe intensity ﬂuctu-
ations. Moreover, we observed that log-normal distribution
precisely ﬁts the acquired data PDF for scintillation index
values less than 0.1, while Gamma-Gamma and K distributions
aptly predict the intensity ﬂuctuations for σ2
I > 1. Meanwhile,
neither of these distributions are capable of predicting the
I < 1. Therefore, we proposed
received irradiance for 0.1 < σ2
a combination of an exponential and a log-normal distributions
to perfectly describe the acquired data PDF for such regimes
of scintillation index. Furthermore, our study on the channel
coherence time have shown larger values than 10−3 seconds
for the channel temporal covariance coefﬁcient implying ﬂat
fading UWOC channels.
