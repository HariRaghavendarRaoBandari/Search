1. introduction

Let M be a Stein manifold and X ⊂ M a closed complex subspace. Cartan
extension theorem says that any holomorphic function f on X can be extended
to a holomorphic function F on the Stein manifold M . Then, it is natural to
ask that if the holomorphic function f has some special property, whether we can
ﬁnd an extension F possessing the same property. In [8], Ohsawa and Takegoshi
considered the extension of L2 holomorphic functions. More precisely, they proved
the following famous Ohsawa-Takegoshi L2 extension theorem:
Theorem 1.1. ([8]). Let Ω be a bounded pseudoconvex domain in Cn. Let ϕ be a
plurisubharmonic function on Ω. Let H be an m-dimensional complex plane in Cn.
Then for any holomorphic function on H∩Ω satisfying

ZH∩Ω

|f |2e−2ϕdλH < ∞,

there exists a holomorphic function F on Ω such that F |H∩Ω = f and

ZΩ

|F |2e−2ϕdλn ≤ CΩ ·ZH∩Ω

|f |2e−2ϕdλH ,

where dλH is the Lebesgue measure, and CΩ is a constant which only depends on
the diameter of Ω and m.

It is natural to ask:

Question. Let Ω ⊂ Cn be a domain and A ⊂ Ω an analytic set through the origin
o. If the above L2 extension theorem holds for any bounded pseudoconvex domain
˜Ω ∋ o such that A ∩ ˜Ω is an analytic set in ˜Ω, can one obtain that o is a regular
point of A?

In this article, we will present a positive answer, i.e.,

Theorem 1.2. Let Ω ⊂ Cn (n ≥ 2) be a domain, A ⊂ Ω an analytic set through
the origin o. Then, for small enough ball Br(0) ⊂ Ω, the L2 extension theorem
holds for (Br(0), A) if and only if o is a regular point of A.

We also present a necessary condition of the L2 extension of bounded holomor-

phic sections from singular analytic sets as follows:

Theorem 1.3. Let Ω ⊂ Cn (n ≥ 2) be a domain and o ∈ Ω the origin. Let A ⊂ Ω
be an analytic set through o with dimo A = d (1 ≤ d ≤ n − 1). If the germ (A, o)
of A at o is reducible or ordIA,o := min{ordo(f )|f ∈ IA,o} ≥ d + 1, then there
exists a small enough ball Br0 (0) ⊂ Ω, a holomorphic function f on Br0 (0)∩A and
a plurisubharmonic function ϕ on Br0(0) with bounded |f |2e−2ϕ such that, for any
r < r0, f has no holomorphic extension F to Br(0) satisfying

ZBr (0)

|F |2e−2ϕdλn < ∞,

In particular, we can take A to be hypersurfaces with Brieskorn singularities in
m = 0} ⊂ Cn, where 2 ≤ m ≤ n, αk ≥ n are

2 + · · · + zαm

Cn, i.e., A := {zα1
positive integers.

1 + zα2

Remark 1.1. In [3], Diederich and Mazzilli gave an example with a surface A deﬁned
by equation z2
2 = 0 in C3, where q > 3 is any ﬁxed uneven integer. Moreover,
Ohsawa also presented an example with A = {z1z2 = 0} ∈ C2 in [7].

2. proof of main results

For the convenience, ﬁrstly we recall the following notion of integral closure of

ideals.

Deﬁnition 2.1. (see [6]). Let R be a commutative ring and let I be an ideal of R.
An element h ∈ R is said to be integrally dependent on I if it satisﬁes a relation

hd + a1hd−1 + ... + ad = 0

(ai ∈ I i, 1 ≤ i ≤ d).

The set ¯I consisting of all elements in R which are integrally dependent on I is
called the integral closure of I in R, which is an ideal of R. I is called integrally
closed if I = ¯I.

To prove main results, we need the following Skoda’s division theorem.

Theorem 2.1. (see [2], Chapter VIII, Theorem 9.10). Let Ω be a pseudoconvex
open subset of Cn, let ϕ be a plurisubharmonic function and g = (g1, ..., gr) be a
r-tuple of holomorphic functions on Ω. Set m = min{n, r − 1}. Then for every
holomorphic function f on Ω such that

I = ZΩ

|f |2|g|−2(m+1+ε)e−ϕdλn < ∞,

there exist holomorphic functions (h1, ..., hr) on Ω such that f =

ZΩ

|h|2|g|−2(m+ε)e−ϕdλn ≤ (1 + m/ε)I,

where |g|2 = |g1|2 + |g2|2 + · · · + |gr|2.

Moreover, the following strong openness property of multiplier ideal sheaves is

also necessary.

Theorem 2.2. ([4, 5]). Let ϕ be a plurisubharmonic function on complex manifold
X and I+(ϕ) := ∪ε>0I ((1 + ε)ϕ). Then

where I (ϕ) is the sheaf of germs of holomorphic functions f such that |f |2e−ϕ is
locally integrable.

I+(ϕ) = I (ϕ),

Lemma 2.3. Let Ω ⊂ Cn (n ≥ 2) be a domain and A ⊂ Ω an analytic set with
pure dimension d through the origin o. Then, there exists a neighborhood U of o
such that

(|z1|2 + · · · + |zn|2)−(d−1)dVA < ∞

where dVA = (ωd|Areg )/d!, ω =

d

w = T z be a unitary transformation of coordinates satisfying, in the coordinates
w = (w1, ..., wn), there is a bounded neighborhood UI of o such that the projection
πI : UI ∩A → U ′I = UI ∩CI is a branched covering with the number of sheets sI for
every I with #I = d (see [1], p.33, Lemma 2). Thus, we have

P#I=d

′ZUI∩T −1(Areg )

|w|−2(d−1)dVw,I < ∞.

(cid:3)

We are now in a position to prove our main results.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. It is enough to prove the necessity.

Without loss of generality, we can assume 1 ≤ dimo A = d ≤ n − 1, and (A, o) is

irreducible by Remark 2.1.

Suppose that o is a singular point of A. It follows from the local parametriza-
tion theorem of analytic sets that there is a local coordinate system (z′; z′′) =
(z1, ..., zd; zd+1, ..., zn) near o such that for some constant C > 0, we have |z′′| ≤
C|z′| for any z ∈ A near o.

Let I ⊂ OA,o be the ideal generated by germs of holomorphic functions ¯z1, ..., ¯zd ∈

OA,o, where OA = OΩ/IA(cid:12)(cid:12)A and ¯zk are the residue classes of zk in OA,o. Since

o is a singularity of A, the embedding dimension dimC mA,o/m2
A,o of A at o is at
least d + 1 (see [2], Chapter II, Proposition 4.32), which implies that there exists
d + 1 ≤ k0 ≤ n such that ¯zk0 6∈ I.

4

QI’AN GUAN AND ZHENQIAN LI

It follows from |z′′| ≤ C|z′| for any z ∈ A near o that |zk0 |2 ≤ C2|z′|2 and
1+C 2 |z|2 on U ∩ A for some neighborhood U of o. By Lemma 2.3, for some

|z′|2 ≥ 1
smaller neighborhood U of o, we have

ZU∩A

|zk0 |2|z′|−2ddVA ≤ C2(1 + C2)d−1ZU∩A

|z|−2(d−1)dVA < ∞.

Take a small ball Br(0) ⊂ U . It follows from the L2 extension theorem that there
exists a holomorphic function F ∈ O(Br(0)) such that F |A = ¯zk0 and

ZBr (0)

|F |2|z′|−2ddλn < ∞.

By Theorem 2.2, for suﬃciently small ε > 0 and smaller Br(0) we have

ZBr (0)

|F |2|z′|−2(d+ε)dλn < ∞.

Then, we infer from Theorem 2.1 that there exist holomorphic functions fk ∈
k=1 fk·zk, i.e., F ∈ (z1, ..., zd) · On. By restricting to A,
(cid:3)

O(Br(0)) such that F = Pd

we have ¯zk0 ∈ I, which contradicts to ¯zk0 6∈ I.

Remark 2.1. Ohsawa’s argument in [7] implies that if (A, o) is reducible, then, for
any small ball Br(0) ⊂ Ω, the L2 extension theorem does not hold for (Br(0), A). In
fact, if (A, o) = (A1, o)∪(A2, o) with (Ai, o) are irreducible. Take fi ∈ On such that
fi|Ai ≡ 0 and fi|Aj 6≡ 0, i 6= j. Let ϕ = log |f1 − f2| and f = f1(f1 − f2)/(f1 + f2).
Then, f |A = f1|A and |f |2e−2ϕ is bounded on A near o. The holding of L2 extension
theorem implies that there exists a holomorphic function F ∈ On such that F =
g(f1 − f2) for some g ∈ On and F |A = f , which implies gf2|A1 ≡ 0, gf1|A2 = f1.
Then, we have g|A1 ≡ 0 and g|A2 ≡ 1, which is impossible.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. By Remark 2.1, it is suﬃcient to prove the case that (A, o)
is irreducible and ordIA,o ≥ d + 1. It follows from dimo A = d and Proposition 4.8
of Chapter II in [2] that, in some local coordinates (z′; z′′) = (z1, ..., zd; zd+1, ..., zn)
near o, there exist Weierstrass polynomials

Pk = zmk

k + a1kzmk−1

k

+ · · · + amkk ∈ Ok−1[zk] ∩ IA,o, k = d + 1, ..., n.

(∗)

with mk = ordoPk. Hence, we have

j

ajk(z1, ..., zk−1) ∈ m

k−1, d + 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ mk.

(∗∗)
Consider the ideal I in OA,o generated by germs of holomorphic functions
¯z1, ..., ¯zλ ∈ OA,o, where ¯zk are the residue classes of zk in OA,o and d ≤ λ ≤
min{ordIA,o − 1, n − 1}. Then, combining (∗) and (∗∗), we obtain that the inte-
gral closure I of I in OA,o is mA,o = (¯z1, ..., ¯zn) · OA,o, the maximal ideal of OA,o.
Moreover, since ordIA,o ≥ λ + 1, we have (¯zk)λ 6∈ I, λ + 1 ≤ k ≤ n. In particular,
(I)λ 6⊂ I.

Let Br(0) ⊂ Ω be a small enough ball such that all Pk, ¯zk are holomorphic on
A∩Br(0). Let ˆgk, 1 ≤ k ≤ λ, be arbitrarily holomorphic extension of gk to Br(0)
with gk = ¯zk and ϕ = λ
2 log |ˆg|2. Since OA,o is reduced, for any (f, o) ∈ (I)λ, we
have |f | ≤ C · |g|λ for some constant C > 0 by Theorem 2.1 vi) in [6]. Hence, for
some small ball Br0(0), we can assume that on A∩Br0(0), f is holomorphic and
|f |2 · e−2ϕ is bounded.

A CHARACTERIZATION OF REGULAR POINTS BY L2 EXTENSION THEOREM

Suppose that we have a L2 extension F ∈ O(Br(0)) with some r < r0 such that

F |A = f and

ZBr (0)

|F |2|ˆg|−2λdλn < ∞.

It follows from Theorem 2.2 that for suﬃciently small ε > 0 and smaller Br(0) we
have

ZBr (0)

|F |2|ˆg|−2(λ+ε)dλn < ∞.

By Theorem 2.1, there exist holomorphic functions fk ∈ O(Br(0)) such that F =
k=1 fk · ˆgk, which implies (F, o) ∈ (ˆg1, ..., ˆgλ) · On. By restricting to A, we have
(f, o) ∈ I. As (f, o) is arbitrary, we obtain (I)λ ⊂ I, which contradicts to (I)λ 6⊂ I.
