Abstract

We consider the N = 4 Liouville theory by varying the linear dilaton coupling constant

Q. It is known that at two diﬀerent values of coupling constant Q =q 2

system exhibits two diﬀerent small N = 4 superconformal symmetries with central charge
c = 6 and c = 6(N − 1), respectively. In the context of string theory these two theories
are considered to describe Coulumb and Higgs branch of the theory and expected to be

N ,−(N − 1)q 2

N

dual to each other. We study the Mathieu and umbral moonshine phenomena in these

two theories and discuss their dual description. We mainly consider the case of AN type

modular invariants.

Introduction

In this paper we study the N = 4 supersymmetric Liouville theory in order to have a deeper
understanding on the mathieu and umbral moonshine phenomena discovered recently [1, 2, 3].
It is known that when one perturbs the large N = 4 theory by varying the strength of the
linear dilaton term Q there are two special values of Q where the theory possesses the small
N = 4 supersymmetry with the central charges c = 6 and c = 6(N − 1). These two theories
have diﬀerent SU(2)R symmetry, i.e. diﬀerent components of SO(4) = SU(2)× SU(2) of large
N = 4 Liouville theory. In the context of string theory these describe Higgs and Coulumb
branches of the theory and are expected to have a description dual to each other.

While the values of central charges (c = 6, 6(N − 1)) appear to diﬀer greatly at large N, it
is known that the value of the eﬀective central charge does not vary much in Liouville theory
as dilaton coupling is varied. Thus we have dual pairs of N = 4 CFT’s (case 1 and 2) with
comparable degrees of freedom. We introduce various assumptions on the elliptic genera of case
1,2 theories and derive algebraic identities and inequalities. We can determine the shadows
and elliptic genera of case 1,2 theories which exhibit nice dual descriptions. We also discuss

the relation of the work [4] to case 1 theories.

We work mainly with A-type modular invariant in this paper; we have some subtleties in

the case of D, E type modular invariants of umbral moonshine which will be discussed in a
future publication.

2 Preliminaries : Free Field Realizations of N = 4 Su-

perconformal Systems

In this preliminary section we summarize the basic properties of the large/small N = 4 super-
conformal algebras and their free ﬁeld realizations.

2.1 Large N = 4 Superconformal Algebra
The large N = 4 superconformal algebra (often denoted as ‘Aγ’) is deﬁned as the SO(4) =
SU(2) × SU(2) extension of Virasoro algebra [5] (see also [6] for a good summary). We have
a stress-energy tensor T , four supercurrents Ga (a = 0, . . . , 3), two SU(2) currents A+,i, A−,i
(i = 1, . . . , 3) whose levels are k+, k−, one U(1) current U, and four Majorana fermions Qa
(a = 0, . . . , 3). The unitarity requires that k+, k− should be positive integers, and the central

c =

2.2 Free Field Realization of Large N = 4 SCA
Let us consider a conformal system composed of a free boson φ, four Majorana fermions ψa
(a = 0, . . . , 3), and SU(2)k current ji (i = 1, 2, 3). φ and ψa are normalized as φ(z)φ(w) ∼
1We are here using a slightly diﬀerent convention from that of [5, 6]. Our A±,i, U , Qa correspond to iA±,i,

iU , and iQa in [5, 6].

We next consider a deformation of (2.7) by turning on the linear dilaton (background charge)

along φ. We shall deform as

T (z) → eT (z) := T (z) − Q
Ga(z) → eGa(z) := Ga(z) + Qi∂ψa(z).

case 2. Q = −(N − 1)q 2

N : small N = 4 SCA of level k+ = N − 1

Here we point out a fact that will be crucial in our arguments: even though the central
charge (2.15) depends on the background charge Q, the eﬀective central charge [8], which
counts the net degrees of freedom, is unchanged under the deformation by linear dilaton. In
the relevant system, the eﬀective central charge should be

ceﬀ = c ≡ 6(cid:18)1 −

1

N(cid:19) ,

(2.18)

irrespective of the value of Q.

To conclude this section, we note that the whole SCA (2.16) reduces to the small N = 4

in (2.16), we ﬁnd that spin 1/2 currents Qa decouple when we set ˜γ = 0 or ˜γ = 1. We thus
obtain the next two ‘small N = 4 points’:

SCA, if we choose particular values of Q. In fact, inspecting the OPE of A±,i(z)eGa(0) given
case 1. Q =q 2

N : small N = 4 SCA of level k− = 1

This case is just the familiar CHS superconformal system [7]. We have ˜c = 6 and ˜γ = 0.

Then, A+,i(z), Qa(z), U(z) are decoupled, and {eT (z), eGa(z), A−,i(z)} generate the small

N = 4 SCA of level 1.

In this case, we have ˜c = 6(N − 1) and ˜γ = 1. Then, A−,i(z), Qa(z), U(z) are decoupled,

and {eT (z), eGa(z), A+,i(z)} generate the small N = 4 SCA with level k+ = N − 1.

These types of reductions from the large N = 4 to the small N = 4 with level k+ or k−
have been already discussed in [5], and also potentially utilized in [9] in order to construct the
Feigin-Fuchs representation of N = 4 SCFT. In the context of string theory on the NS5-NS1
background, the case 1 is identiﬁed with the world-sheet CFT for the ‘short string’ sector (or
that describing the ‘Coulomb branch tube’), while the case 2 corresponds to the ‘long string’

sector (or the ‘Higgs branch tube’) [10]. Therefore, they are expected to be dual to each
other from the viewpoints of AdS3/CFT2-duality.
In our discussions later, this fact would
suggest the existence of two diﬀerent descriptions of the umbral moonshine [2, 3] based on
the case 1 and 2. Indeed, these two theories have the equal eﬀective central charge as was
already mentioned, which implies the essentially same asymptotic growth of massive (non-BPS)

excitations characterizing the moonshine phenomena.

3 Elliptic Genera of N = 4 Liouville Model

3.1 Sketch of Outline

Our main purpose is to evaluate the elliptic genera of the N = 4 Liouville theory with suitable
Liouville potentials. However, it seems hard to directly carry out this computation because of
the complexity of the N = 4 Liouville potentials.

We shall thus take another route: regard the relevant N = 4 superconformal system as the

ZN -orbifold of

SU(2)N /U(1) ⊗ SL(2)N /U(1) ∼= SU(2)N /U(1) ⊗ [N = 2 Liouville]Q=√ 2

N

,

for the ’case 1’ (ˆc = 2) [11], and then, try to deform the system into the ’case 2’ (ˆc = 2(N −1)).
The next statements are crucial in our evaluation of the elliptic genus of the case 2.

(i) The case 1 and 2 correspond to theories with diﬀerent central charges. Nevertheless, these

two theories should possess the equal eﬀective central charge (2.18);

ceﬀ = 6(cid:18)1 −

1

N(cid:19) ,

as we already emphasized. ceﬀ characterizes the asymptotic growth of degeneracy of states
due to Cardy formula. In terms of the elliptic genus, since Z (NS)(τ ) ≡ Z (NS)(τ, 0) :=
q

2 (cid:1) is S-invariant, (2.18) implies that the IR-behavior of Z (NS)(τ ) becomes2

τ2 → +∞

4N ) (cid:12)(cid:12)Z (NS)(τ )(cid:12)(cid:12) < ∞.

For the case 1, we can easily conﬁrm that this condition is satisﬁed. We will later discuss
how we can reﬁne the constraint (3.1) due to the SU(2)N −2 symmetry that is a part of
N = 4 superconformal symmetry in the case 2. Indeed, the resultant constraint will play
a crucial role to determine the elliptic genus of the case 2.

(ii) When evaluating the elliptic genera, the contributing states in these systems are weighted

by diﬀerent U(1)-currents. Namely, setting

ψ± :=

1

√2(cid:0)ψ3 ∓ iψ0(cid:1) ,

χ± :=

1

√2(cid:0)ψ1 ± iψ2(cid:1) ,

(3.2)

the U(1)R-current for each case is written as follows;

2Here, we may have a subtlety, since Z (NS)(τ ) could be non-holomorphic due to the existence of modular
completions, of which correction terms show a continuous spectrum. Thus, the Cardy-type argument in this

context truly means that the asymptotic growth of the coeﬃcients of q-expansion of the holomorphic part
Z (NS)
hol (τ ), which only includes a discrete spectrum, is governed by the IR-behavior of total Z (NS)(τ ).

6

• case 1 :

• case 2 :

J (ˆc=2) := 2A−,3 = i(ψ3ψ0 − ψ1ψ2) = ψ+ψ− + χ+χ−.

(3.3)

J (ˆc=2(N −1)) ≡ 2A+,3 := i(−ψ3ψ0 − ψ1ψ2) + 2j3 = −ψ+ψ− + χ+χ− + 2j3.

(3.4)

(iii) Elliptic genera should be invariant under generic marginal deformations, at least, for
the holomorphic part that is contributed from the BPS states. Moreover, the non-

holomorphic part (‘holomorphic anomaly’) only includes the continuous spectrum prop-
agating in the asymptotic region where the relevant Liouville potentials are negligible.

These facts imply that both of holomorphic and non-holomorphic terms of elliptic genus
of the case 2 do not depend on the detail of Liouville potential.

Based on these considerations, we propose that the elliptic genus of the case 2 would be

uniquely determined in the following way;

• We ﬁrst evaluate the elliptic genus of case 1, that is, Z case 1(τ, z).
• Secondly, we deform the holomorphic anomaly term in Z case 1(τ, z), taking account of
the distinction of U(1)-currents between (3.3) and (3.4). The expected non-holomorphic
term should be expanded in terms of the N = 4 massive characters of ˆc = 2(N − 1).

• Finally, we determine the holomorphic part of the wanted elliptic genus, which is expected
to be written in terms of the N = 4 massless characters of ˆc = 2(N − 1). It will be
crucial that the possible ambiguity by adding general holomorphic Jacobi forms can be
removed by examining the IR-behavior of the NS-sector elliptic genus, which extends the

argument of eﬀective central charge given above.

3.2 Preliminaries

3.2.1 Branching Relation for the N = 2 Minimal Model
As a preparation, we start with recalling the coset construction of N = 2 minimal model.

The SU(2)k character for the spin ℓ/2-integrable representation is given as

χ(k)
ℓ (τ, z)

:=

≡

iθ1(τ, z)

and the string function cℓ

m(τ ) is deﬁned by the expansion;

cℓ
m(τ )Θm,k(τ, z).

(3.6)

m (τ, z) = Xr∈Zk

χℓ,s

where the branching function χℓ,s

m (τ, z) is explicitly written as

cℓ
m−s+4r(τ )Θ2m+(k+2)(−s+4r),2k(k+2)(τ, z/(k + 2)).

(3.8)

The characters of the N = 2 minimal model are written in terms of the branching functions
as follows;

ch(NS)
ℓ,m (τ, z) = χℓ,0
ch(fNS)
ℓ,m (τ, z) = χℓ,0
ch(R)
ℓ,m(τ, z) = χℓ,1
ch(eR)
ℓ,m(τ, z) = χℓ,1

m (τ, z) + χℓ,2
m (τ, z) − χℓ,2
m (τ, z) + χℓ,3
m (τ, z) − χℓ,3

m (τ, z),

m (τ, z),

m (τ, z),

m (τ, z).

(3.9)

Now, the parameter w in (3.7) is interpreted as the deformation parameter ˜γ (or Q) in the

previous section. It is explicitly identiﬁed as

w = 2˜γz,

and the corresponding U(1)R-current is given as

J ˜γ = 2˜γ(A+,3 − A−,3) + 2A−,3 ≡ 2˜γ(cid:0)j3 − ψ+ψ−(cid:1) +(cid:0)ψ+ψ− + χ+χ−(cid:1) .

We exhibit some useful computations related to the resultant formula (3.35) and make a few

remarks. For convenience, we deﬁne the non-holomorphic modular form bH (N )(τ ) of weight 2

by the relation;

in the holomorphic Jacobi form N −1

is anticipated. It precisely cancels the ‘graviton term’ included

12 φ0,1(τ, z) appearing in Z case 1(τ, z) (3.35).

in φ0,1(τ, z) yields the leading contribution (’graviton term’),

θ2(τ )(cid:17)2
In fact, the term(cid:16) θ2(τ,z)

∞Xn=1

(3.46)

with integer coeﬃcients an as long as N − 1 divides 24. Moreover, since the second term

in (A.7), we expect that all the coeﬃcients an are positive.

Amusingly, for the special case N = 2 of Mathieu moonshine, we have an alternative

4The holomorphic part of the identity (3.48) essentially means the familiar equivalence between the N = 4
massless character of level 1 and the spectral ﬂow sum of the N = 2 massless matter characters with ˆc = 2
[19], which is also presented in [4]. The identity (3.48) claims that this equivalence still holds after taking the

modular completions, and it is surely a non-trivial identity. One of its proof is obtained by setting N = 2 in
the identity (3.70) which we will prove. Note that the minimal character ch( eR)
2 Kronecker delta : δ(2)

0,m(τ, z) just reduces to the mod

m,−1 in the case of N = 2 (ˆcmin = 0).

5This is equivalent to the identity that Zagier gave in his lecture at the Durham workshop, August 2015.

The second line of (3.47) is again derived in Appendix B.

We can also rewrite the ﬁrst line of (3.47) by replacing 1/w in the integrand with an elliptic

function 1

3ξ(τ, w) deﬁned by

ξ(τ, w) :=

∂
∂w

ln(cid:18)

θ1(τ, w)3

θ2(τ, w)θ3(τ, w)θ4(τ, w)(cid:19) .

(3.52)

It is easy to see that ξ(τ, z) is an elliptic function of order 4 which possesses simple poles at
w = 0, 1

2 with the residues

2, τ

2 , τ +1

Resw=0[ξ(τ, w)] = 3, Resw= 1

2

[ξ(τ, w)] = Resw= τ

2

[ξ(τ, w)] = Resw= τ +1

2

[ξ(τ, w)] = −1.

Then, the integrand in (3.47) becomes an elliptic function with a cubic pole w = 0 and simple
poles w = 1

2 . We thus obtain by the contour deformation

Now, let us begin our analysis for the system of ’case 2’, i.e. the N = 4 theory with ˆc =
2(N − 1). According to our strategy addressed in subsection 3.1, we motivate Z case 2(τ, z) by
modifying the coupling of the variable z in Z case 1(τ, z). The relevant branching relation is

up to an overall phase factor. This is obtained by the replacement: −z 7→ (N − 1)z in the

function bF (N )(∗,∗) appearing in Z case 1 (3.22), which properly corrects the diﬀerence of the

17

U(1)R-charges between the case 1 and 2, and reproduces the expected holomorphic anomaly
terms expanded by the N = 4 massive characters. (Recall the branching relations (3.12) and

the form of non-holomorphic Poincare series (3.38);

of the lemma given in Appndix C.

3.4.2 Considerations on the eﬀective central charge

ℓ,ℓ+1+2a(τ, z)bF (N )(ℓ + 1, a; τ, (N − 1)z)

(3.79)

Namely, we claim that the elliptic genus of case 2 should be equal to the modular completion
(N − 1, 0; τ, z) itself. This has been suggested from
the consideration on the holomorphic anomaly (or the shadow) given at subsection 3.1. It is

of the N = 4 massless character ch(eR)

0

20

similar to the case of the elliptic genus of N = 2 Liouville theory (∼= SL(2)/U(1)-supercoset)
which is given only in terms of modular completions of N = 2 massless characters [16, 13].

However, one might still ask: The holomorphic anomaly remains unchanged even if we
add any holomorphic Jacobi form with weight 0, index N − 1 to (3.79). How can we reject
this possibility? In the simplest case of N = 2, the absence of holomorphic Jacobi form
(∝ φ0,1(τ, z)) just means the familiar fact of decoupling gravity in the non-compact models
(see e.g. [17]). However, for the cases with N > 2, we have a number of holomorphic Jacobi

forms, and the situation would get much more non-trivial.

To answer this question and conﬁrm the validity of above result (3.79), let us present a

consideration about the eﬀective central charge mentioned before. We start with reﬁning the
ceﬀ-condition (3.1) based on the aﬃne SU(2)-symmetry as the underlying structure of N = 4
SCA, as we promised. To exhibit it, we expand the elliptic genus in the NS-sector in terms of
the angular variable y ≡ e2πiz as

(3.81) is obviously satisﬁed.

6In fact, the coeﬃcients of massless characters aℓ can be uniquely determined from Z (NS)(τ, z) by this
assumption, while the massive coeﬃcients bj,n would not be necessarily unique. However, this ambiguity does

not aﬀect the following discussions.

22

The above result (3.79) is indeed consistent with this character expansion (3.88) (with vanishing
coeﬃcients b′

j,n).

On the other hand, as shown in [2], any holomorphic Jacobi form can never be written in
the form (3.88): i.e. we need additional contributions from the massless characters with ℓ ≥ 1,
or the massive characters with conformal weight ‘below the massgap’ h < h(j − 1) + 1
4 in order
to construct a holomorphic Jacobi form. In this way, we conclude that there is no room for
adding extra holomorphic Jacobi forms to (3.79).

3.4.3 Some remarks

We add a few remarks for the analyses in this subsection:

(i) It should be emphasized that the case 2 is not equivalent with

N(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ZN −orbifold

,

(3.89)

dilaton Q = −(N − 1)q 2

which is the superconformal system of the type studied in [21]. The same value of linear
N is expected for our case 2, but the N = 2 Liouville potential
does not preserve the N = 4 superconformal symmetry except for the special case N = 2
(ˆc = 2). In fact, we have

(v, a; τ, z) ≡

reduces the radius of asymptotic cylindrical region of the N = 2 Liouville theory so as
to be compatible with the N = 4 superconformal symmetry.

(ii) An important consequence of the ‘ceﬀ-condition’ (3.81), which physically means the nor-
malizability of spectrum, is the inevitable emergence of holomorphic anomaly in Z case 2(τ, z)
as long as we require its good modular property.

It would be also worthwhile to note the fact that the formulas of modular S-transformations

of any N = 4 superconformal characters in the eR-sector are schematically written as
[N = 4 character]|S = A ch(eR)

[N = 4 massive character],

(3.93)

0

(ℓ = 0) +Xj Zh≥h(j)

where the coeﬃcient A in the R.H.S does not vanish when the character of L.H.S is any
massless character. Namely, we ﬁnd the following facts for the representations in the

R.H.S of (3.93);

• Only the ℓ = 0 massless character can appear.
• The massive characters with conformal weight satisfying h ≥ h(j) (‘above mass

gap’) only appears.

These representations are precisely identical to those satisfying the condition (3.81). This

feature is indeed anticipated, since the modular invariant partition function (and thus
the elliptic genus) should only include the normalizable spectrum that contributes to the

net degrees of freedom.

’Duality’ in N = 4 Liouville Theory and Umbral Moon-

As we emphasized several times, these two N = 4 systems have the same degrees of freedom
even though the central charges diﬀer from each other, and are expected to be dual in the sense
of AdS3/CFT2-correspondence. We can explicitly observe a very simple correspondence

bF (N )(v, a; τ,−z) for case 1 ←→ bF (N )(v, a; τ, (N − 1)z) for case 2.

Now, we present some comments on the relation with the analyses on the ’umbral moon-

(4.1)

shine’ [2, 3, 4, 23]. In [4], the authors studied (the holomorphic part of) the extention of (3.22)
with general modular coeﬃcients determined by the simply-laced root system X corresponding
to each Niemeier lattice. We have rank X = 24 by deﬁnition, and let N be the Coxetor number

of X. A Niemeier lattice is explicitly expressed as

X =ai

Xi, Xi

rank Xi = 24,

(4.2)

where each Xi is the irreducible component of root system possessing the common Coxetor
number N.

We can schematically write

(4.3)

where N Xi
r,s denotes the modular invariant coeﬃcients of SU(2)N −2 associated to the simply-
laced root system Xi, and we set N X
r,s . One may identify Z case 1(Xi)(τ, z) as the
elliptic genus of the ALE space associated to the simple singularity of the type Xi. In [4] it

was suggested that the root system X =`i Xi should be identiﬁed as the geometrical data of

various K3-singularities.

25

Since we assume rank X (≡Pi rank Xi) = 24, we can rewrite (4.3) as

X (τ, z) = 2φ0,1(τ, z) −

This is derived from (4.3) with the help of the branching relation (3.27). (We recall that the

Let us next consider the type X generalization of (3.79), which is related to (4.3) via the

mined uniquely. For a suﬃciently large N, there exist non-trivial holomorphic weak Ja-
cobi forms of weight 1, index N, which we denote here, say, ψ1,N (τ, z). Then, we may add
2θ1(τ,z)2

1,N (τ, z) to the ﬁrst term of (4.8), while subtracting the same function from the

Let us discuss the relation of the present analysis with a closely related consideration given
1,N (τ, z)

in [4]. For this purpose it is convenient to introduce the meromorphic Jacobi form ΨX
with weight 1, index N deﬁned by

ΨX

2θ1(τ, z)2 ΦX
following [2, 3]. Then, (4.8) can be rewritten as

1,N (τ, z) :=

0,N −1(τ, z) ≡ bf (1)(τ, z)ΦX

iη(τ )3θ1(τ, 2z)

where the ﬁrst and second terms in R.H.S correspond to the polar and ﬁnite parts in the

terminology of [2, 3].

If X includes only the A-type components, our results are manifestly consistent with those

given in [4]. Namely, both the polar and ﬁnite parts in (4.14) (the ‘case 2 theory’ with
ˆc = 2(N − 1)) separately correspond to the ﬁrst and second terms in (4.4) (the ‘case 1 theory’
with ˆc = 2) under the transformation given in [4];

(4.15)

Here, we denoted a (holomorphic or non-holomorphic) weak Jacobi form of weight w and index
d by the symbol ’ϕw,d(τ, z)’, and the second line is identiﬁed as the Eichler-Zagier operator
W(N) (ZN -orbifolding). In fact, the ﬁrst term in R.H.S of (4.14) just becomes

bf (1)(τ, z)Z [ˆc=2(N −1)]

X

(τ, z) =

24

N − 1bf (N )(τ, z),

(4.16)

by substituting the identity (3.70) into (4.6), and the map (4.15) converts (4.14) into the
deﬁnition of Z [ˆc=2]
X (τ, z) itself. (Recall the formula of elliptic genus of the N = 2 minimal model
(3.24).) Furthermore, the correspondence of ﬁnite parts by (4.15) is found to be equivalent

with the relation (4.12) due to the branching relation (3.27). The fact (4.16) also implies that
ΨX
1,N (τ, z) here coincides with the ‘umbral Jacobi form’ constructed in [3]. It is also obvious
that (4.16) is consistent with our duality relation (4.7) because of the formula (3.35).

In the cases when X includes D or E-type components, however, ΨX

1,N (τ, z) generally
diﬀers from the umbral Jacobi form.
Indeed, according to the explicit construction of the
umbral Jacobi form given in [3], it would contain the n-torsion points with n|N created by the
Eichler-Zagier operator written schematically as

ciW(ni).

WX ≡Xni|N

28

On the other hand, ΨX

1,N (τ, z) given above possesses the n′-torsion points with n′|(N − 1),

Nevertheless, if we replace ΨX

which inherits from the functions bF (N )(r, a; τ, (N − 1)z) in the expression (4.6)8.
1,N (τ, z) with the umbral Jacobi form of [3] in the ‘elliptic
genus’ Z [ˆc=2(N −1)]
(τ, z), the duality relation (4.7) is still satisﬁed, because the diﬀerence of
these meromorphic Jacobi forms just yields a vanishing contribution to the contour integral.

X

How about the correspondence (4.15)? Indeed, one can show that the claim of [4] still holds
(τ, z)
X (τ, z) and Z K3(τ, z) ≡ 2φ0,1(τ, z) by the map (4.15),

even when we replace the umbral Jacobi form with ΨX
and ΨX
as shown by the following arguments;

1,N (τ, z). Namely, bf (1)(τ, z)Z [ˆc=2(N −1)]

1,N (τ, z) still correspond to the Z [ˆc=2]

X

(i) It turns out that the ﬁnite part of (4.14) is mapped to that of Z [ˆc=2]

X (τ, z), and the relation

(4.12) still holds.

(ii) When considering the map (4.15), all the n′-torsion points included in ΨX

1,N (τ, z) are
canceled out with the zeros of the factor θ1(τ, (N − 1)z) 9. We thus ﬁnd that ΨX
1,N (τ, z)
is always mapped to the unique holomorphic Jacobi form αφ0,1(τ, z) with some constant
coeﬃcient α.

(iii) This coeﬃcient α is, however, just determined from the ﬁnite part so that the contribution

of ‘graviton representation’ should be canceled out.
In fact, it is straightforward to
conﬁrm that (4.6) cannot include such a term after converting it into the ˆc = 2-system

by the transformation (4.15). This is quite similar to the argument given in the subsection
3.3.1 (see the discussions around (3.44), (3.45)). On the other hand, the ﬁnite part of
12 q− 1
in the NS-sector as in (3.45). Therefore, the cancellation of the graviton term implies
that

(4.6) is mapped tobhX(τ ) θ1(τ,z)2

η(τ )3 as noted above, yielding the h = 0 behavior ∼ − N −1

4

which completes the proof of our statement.

8Such torsion points are canceled out in the cases when X is made up only of the A-type components, as

we illustrated in subsection 3.4.1.

9On the other hand, the n-torsion points appearing in the umbral Jacobi form are canceled out by the factor

θ1(τ, N z).

5 Discussions

X

We conclude that our ansatz (4.6) for Z [ˆc=2(N −1)]
(τ, z) should reproduce the expected expan-
sion coeﬃcients bhX
r (τ ) whose holomorphic parts give the coeﬃcients of massive representa-
tions of Mathieu and umbral moonshine. Therefore, we naturally consider that there are two
world-sheet descriptions of the moonshine phenomena based on the theories Z [ˆc=2]
X (τ, z) and
Z [ˆc=2(N −1)]
(τ, z), depending on a diﬀerent choice of SU(2)R symmetry. Mathieu moonshine
sits at the self-dual point.

X

Our observation is related to the work [4] (also to the paper [23]). Without invoking the idea

of duality authors of [4] introduced the transformation rule between corresponding Jacobi forms
of the two theories which seem to ﬁt to our results very well. Possible geometrical interpretation

of the umbral moonshine based on particular types of singular K3 is also discussed. As we
brieﬂy discussed in section 4, the correspondence (4.15) proposed in [4] is likely to be consistent

with our ’duality relation’ (4.7).

Some of the results in this paper appear correct by symmetry arguments (modularity etc)

but are not veriﬁed explicitly: We have not computed the holomorphic parts of functionsbhX

r
except the case of Mathieu moonshine. In subsequent work we want to ﬁll these gaps. We also
discussed mainly A-type modular invariant and not D and E types.

One should keep it in mind that the Jacobi form ΦX
0,N −1(τ, z) given here is at most
meromorphic except for the purely A-type models, since ΨX
1,N (τ, z) generally includes torsion
points as we mentioned. Consequently, it would be subtle whether one can strictly interpret
Z [ˆc=2(N −1)]
(τ, z) as the elliptic genus of a well-deﬁned superconformal system. Of course, we
have no such subtlety for the ’dual’ ˆc = 2-realization (4.3) for an arbitrary X. We would like
to further discuss this point in a future work.

index r, and more crucially, allow non-holomorphic dependence on τ , while we keep the
holomorphicity with respect to z 10.

Appendix B: Derivation of the Formulas (3.39), (3.42)

and (3.47)

In this appendix, we derive the formulas (3.39), (3.42) and (3.47).

10According to the original terminology of [22], the ‘weak Jacobi form’ of weight k and index r (k, r ∈ Z≥0)

means that Φ(τ, z) should be Fourier expanded as

Φ(τ, z) = Xn∈Z≥0 Xℓ∈Z

c(n, ℓ)qnyℓ,

in addition to the conditions (A.14) and (A.15). It is called the ‘Jacobi form’ if it further satisﬁes the condition:
c(n, ℓ) = 0 for ∀n, ℓ s.t. 4nr − ℓ2 < 0.

Derivation of (3.39) :

We start with the deﬁnition of bH (N )(τ ) (3.37). Substituting (3.38) into (3.37), we obtain

Appendix C: A Lemma for Weak Jacobi Form

In this appendix, we present a simple lemma that is necessary for the proof of (3.70).

Lemma:

Let Φ(τ, z) be any holomorphic weak Jacobi form of weight 0 and index d(∈ Z>0). Then, the

d

4 yd Φ(cid:0)τ, z + τ +1

2 (cid:1) has the following behavior around τ ∼ i∞

’NS-counterpart’ Φ(NS)(τ, z) ≡ q
(for a generic value of z);

Φ(NS)(τ, z) ∼ qα,

(τ ∼ i∞).

(C.1)

[proof]

The proof is just straightforward. Let us recall that bases of holomorphic weak Jacobi

forms of weight 0 and index d(∈ Z>0) consist of the functions deﬁned by

φ(n1,n2,n3)(τ, z) ∝ Xσ∈S3 (cid:18) θ2(τ, z)

φ(n1,n2,n3)(τ, 0) = 1,

θ4(τ ) (cid:19)2nσ(3)

θ3(τ ) (cid:19)2nσ(2)(cid:18)θ4(τ, z)

θ2(τ ) (cid:19)2nσ(1)(cid:18) θ3(τ, z)
∀(n1, n2, n3) ∈ S (d),
≥0 ; n1 ≥ n2 ≥ n3 ≥ 0, n1 + n2 + n3 = d(cid:9) .

(C.3)

with

S (d) :=(cid:8)(n1, n2, n3) ∈ Z3

Now, we deﬁne the NS counterpart of the function φ(n1,n2,n3)(τ, z) by the spectral ﬂow

z 7→ z + τ +1
2 ;

φ(NS)
(n1,n2,n3)(τ, z) := q

Then, by using the evaluations around τ ∼ i∞

Since we are assuming n1 + n2 + n3 = d and n1 ≥ n2 ≥ n3 ≥ 0, we ﬁnd

Therefore, we obtain
