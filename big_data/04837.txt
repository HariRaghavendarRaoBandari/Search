ABSTRACT: The internal quantum eﬃciency (IQE) of an organic
photovoltaic device (OPV) is proportional to the number of free charge
carriers generated and their conductivity, per absorbed photon. How-
ever, both the IQE and the quantities that determine it, for exam-
ple, electron–hole binding, charge separation, electron–hole recombi-
nation, and conductivity, can only be inferred indirectly from experi-
ments. Using density functional theory, we calculate the excited-state
formation energy, charge transfer, and zero-bias conductance in the sin-
glet ground state and triplet excited state across polymer/fullerene and
polymer/single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) OPV donor/acceptor
bulk heterojunctions. Speciﬁcally, we compare polythiophene (PT) and
poly(3-methylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3MT) as donors and C60 chains
with (6,4), (6,5), and (10,5) SWNTs as acceptors. We ﬁnd the conduc-
tivity increases substantially for both the excited triplet relative to the singlet ground state and for PT compared with P3MT due to the
increased charge transfer and the resulting improvement in donor/acceptor level alignment. Similarly, the (6,4) SWNT, with a larger
SWNT band gap and greater conductivity than fullerenes, provides the highest conductivities of 5 and 9% of the theoretical maximum
for electron and hole carriers, respectively. This work has important implications for both the optimization of polymer/SWNT bulk
heterojunctions and the design of new OPV bulk heterojunctions in silico.

1. INTRODUCTION

The internal quantum eﬃciency (IQE) of a type II bulk heterojunc-
tion within an organic photovoltaic (OPV) device is simply the ra-
tio of free charge carrier generation to photon absorption at a given
photon energy. As such, the IQE depends on the ease of separating
electron and holes, and the resulting current through the OPV. The
former depends on the electron–hole binding, charge transfer from
donor to acceptor, and electron–hole recombination, while the latter
depends on the conductance from donor to acceptor across the bulk
heterojunction. Note that unlike the photovoltaic eﬃciency, 1 the
IQE is independent of the device’s optical absorption spectra, that
is, the number of absorbed photons, as it is calculated per absorbed
photon. 2

To estimate the relative exciton binding between type II bulk het-
erojunctions, one may compare the ﬁrst transition for the isolated
acceptor, for example, the E11 transition of a nanotube, with the
formation energy E f (↑↑) of the triplet excited state from the singlet
ground state, that is, their diﬀerence in total energy. A much smaller
triplet formation energy for the isolated acceptor, E f (↑↑) (cid:28) E11,
suggests that electron–hole separation may prove diﬃcult. This is
the case for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), where the
measured singlet exciton binding is ∼ 0.4 eV. 3–7 Conversely, if the
triplet formation energy in the bulk heterojunction is smaller than
that for the isolated acceptor, this is indicative of hole transfer to the
donor for type II bulk heterojunctions. In this way, the triplet for-
mation energy can be used to compare the relative ease or diﬃculty
of electron hole separation and the probability of recombination in
bulk heterojunctions.

The ease of electron–hole separation in the bulk heterojunction
may also be directly probed by considering the diﬀerence in charge
transfer from donor to acceptor between the triplet excited state
and the singlet ground state. 8,9 However, although a greater charge
transfer in the triplet excited state means the electron and hole are
separated onto diﬀerent molecules in the bulk heterojunction, it
does not address whether the separated electron and hole are free
charge carriers or remain bound within the junction.

To determine whether separated electrons and holes truly behave
as free charge carriers, the degree of scattering, and the result-
ing current through the OPV, one should compute the conductance
across the bulk heterojunction from the donor to the acceptor in the
excited state. In particular, one should consider the conductance at
the Fermi level of the excited electron/hole to determine the number
of free electron/hole carriers.

In this study, we carry out density functional theory (DFT) cal-
culations of the excited-state formation energy, charge transfer, and
zero-bias conductance of prototypical donor/acceptor bulk hetero-
junctions 10–23 in the singlet ground state and triplet excited state.
For the donor molecule we employ the prototypical photoactive
polymers: polythiophene (PT) 24 and poly(3-methylthiophene-2,5-
diyl) (P3MT). 25 For the acceptor molecule we compare fullerene
(C60) chains with semiconducting (6,4), (6,5), and (10,5) SWNTs,
whose band gaps range between 1 and 1.4 eV. 26 These systems ex-
hibit only a minor structural relaxation in the triplet excited state
(<25 meV). This justiﬁes our neglect of molecular vibration as a
ﬁrst approximation, 27 as done in previous studies of photovoltaic
eﬃciencies. 28–30

We model the excited-state formation energy using the total en-

ergy diﬀerence between the triplet excited state and the singlet
ground state from DFT. To obtain the charge transfer from donor
to acceptor in the bulk heterojunction, we perform a simpliﬁed
Bader analysis 31 of the DFT all-electron density. Finally, we cal-
culate the Landauer–Bütticker conductance of electron and hole
charge carriers from donor to acceptor across the bulk heterojunc-
tion based on the DFT tight-binding Hamiltonians using a multi-
terminal implementation 32 of the nonequilibrium Green’s function
(NEGF) method. 33–36 In this way, we obtain the conductance from
the isolated polymer, through the polymer/SWNT or polymer/C60
heterojunction, and out the SWNT or C60 chain, in the quantum
coherent regime. Our use of the NEGF method for calculating the
conductance across polymer/SWNT and polymer/C60 heterojunc-
tions is justiﬁed by the ballistic transport, long coherence length,
and high thermal conductivity of SWNTs, 32,37–40 and the domi-
nance of tunneling in transport processes across C60 chains. This
method provides a more sophisticated description of the transport
processes, and IQE of the device, than previous studies employing
the Newns-Anderson model. 28–30

2. METHODOLOGY

All DFT calculations were performed with locally centered atomic
orbitals (LCAOs) and the projector augmented wave (PAW) im-
plementation of the gpaw code, 41–43 within the generalized gra-
dient approximation (PBE) 44 for the exchange correlation (xc)-
functional. We employed a double-zeta polarized (DZP) LCAO
basis set for representing the density, wave functions, and tight-
binding Hamiltonian, which yields transmission functions in quan-
titative agreement (∆ < 50 meV) with plane-wave codes and max-
imally localized Wannier functions. 45 All calculations employed a
room temperature Fermi ﬁlling (kBT ≈ 25 meV), with total energies
extrapolated to T → 0 K, that is, excluding the electronic entropy
contribution to the free energy −S T. In this way we avoided an
unrealistic smearing of the excited electron and hole in the triplet
excited state calculations. We included two thirds of the number of
electrons (2⁄3Ne) many bands within the calculations. This has been
shown to be suﬃcient to converge the ﬁrst π → π∗ transitions of
graphene 46 and SWNT/polymer hybrid systems, 47 and the optical
spectra of polymers and oligomers 48 in the random phase approxi-
mation (RPA).

Structural optimization was performed within the atomic sim-
ulation environment (ASE), 49 until a maximum force below
0.05 eV/Å was obtained. We employed more than 5 Å of vac-
uum to the cell boundaries orthogonal to the C60 chain, (6,4), (6,5),
(10,5) SWNTs, polythiophene (PT), poly(3-methylthiophene-2,5-

2

diyl) (P3MT), and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), and
obtained the optimized unit cell parameters along their axes L(cid:107) =
18.811, 40.915, 11.348, 7.867, 7.846, and 7.797 Å, respectively.
Here PT, P3MT, and P3HT are modeled using two thiophene, 3-
methylthiophene, and 3-hexylthiophene units, respectively, in S -
trans conﬁguration. To sample the Brillouin zone, we included
three k points along the axis of PT, P3MT, P3HT, (6,4) SWNT, and
(10,5) SWNT and one k-point along the axis of the (6,5) SWNT.

The C60/polymer

junctions were modeled by aligning 10
thiophene/3-methylthiophene units orthogonal to a chain of three
C60 molecules and fully relaxing the resulting structure, shown in
Figure 1. The SWNT/polymer junctions were modeled by aligning
six thiophene/3-methylthiophene units for the smaller (6,4) and
(6,5) SWNTs and eight thiophene/3-methylthiophene units for the
(10,5) SWNT orthogonal to the tube, which was repeated once
along its axis, and performing single-point calculations for the
resulting conﬁgurations shown in Figure 1. This repetition of the
thiophene/3-methylthiophene units makes a single k-point sam-
pling along the polymer axis suﬃcient for describing the Brillouin
zone.

By orienting the polymer and SWNT orthogonal to each other,
this conﬁguration describes the limit of a minimal SWNT–polymer
overlap. In fact, by orienting diagonally across the SWNT axis a
ten thiophene unit oligomer, which should provide a reasonable de-
scription of PT, 48 one obtains a greater charge transfer and stronger
hybridization between the polymer and SWNT. 47

For the SWNT/polymer junctions, the intermolecular distances
were ﬁxed between one carbon atom located at the centered C–C
single bond of the polymer and a carbon atom of the tube, which
were both aligned in the axis orthogonal to the tube and the polymer
axis as shown in Figure 1. The alignment was achieved by shifting
the polymer along the tube axis. This chosen intermolecular C–C
distance is 3.35 for PT and 3.39 Å for P3MT. We slightly increased
the P3MT intermolecular distance to reduce the repulsive forces
from the hydrogen atoms of the methyl group. Both minimum dis-
tances employed are consistent with the interlayer distance of mul-
tiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and graphite, 50 of ∼ 3.4 Å.
We performed DFT calculations for each system in both the sin-
glet ground state (↑↓) and triplet excited state (↑↑). The triplet ex-
cited state calculations were performed by ﬁxing the total magnetic
moment µ of the system, and using separate Fermi levels for the

The charge densities associated with the excited electron ρe(r)
and hole ρh(r) in the triplet state are the negative and positive re-
gions, respectively, of the all-electron charge density diﬀerence be-
tween that of the triplet excited state (↑↑) and singlet ground state
(↑↓), that is, ∆ρ(r) = ρ↑↑(r)− ρ↑↓(r).

To quantify the charge transfer from donor to acceptor, we per-
form a simpliﬁed Bader analysis 31 of the all-electron charge den-
sity in the singlet ground state ρ↑↓(r) and triplet excited state ρ↑↑(r).
We begin by integrating the charge density over the plane A of
the donor and acceptor axes to obtain the linear charge density
λ(z) =
A ρ(r, ϕ,z)rdϕdr. We then partition λ(z) at its minimum
zmin in between the polymer and C60 chain or SWNT. The charge

The periodic DFT Hamiltonian and overlap matrices in the
LCAO basis, H and S, are employed within the NEGF formalism
to calculate the Landauer–Bütticker conductance for a multitermi-
nal conﬁguration. 32,34,36 To do so, one must ﬁrst remove overlap el-
ements between atomic sites separated by more than half the length
of the unit cell along the transmission direction, that is, L(cid:107)/2, to
obtain nonperiodic Hamiltonian and overlap matrices H and S .

The coupling matrix to the semi-inﬁnite leads V for the SWNTs
is obtained by repeating the periodic DFT Hamiltonian matrix for
the isolated SWNT H2×2 =

elements between atomic sites separated by more than L(cid:107), yielding
the nonperiodic Hamiltonian for semi-inﬁnite lead α Hα =

This is reasonable for the SWNTs considered herein, for which
L(cid:107) (cid:38) 20 Å. In this way we avoid performing a DFT calculation with
a repeated unit cell to obtain the Hamiltonian of the principle layer,
H, which only couples to the next principle layer through the cou-
pling matrix V. We then align the semi-inﬁnite lead Hamiltonian
Hα to the nonperiodic DFT Hamiltonian for the bulk heterojunction
using the ﬁrst onsite energy of the same SWNT carbon atom at the
cell boundary. This is unnecessary for PT, P3MT, and C60 because
their lead Hamiltonians are extracted directly from the bulk het-
erojunction Hamiltonian. In these cases two thiophene units, two
3-methylthiophene units, and a C60 molecule comprise a principle
layer, with couplings to the next nearest layer numerically zero.

bulk heterojunction from donor to acceptor is then obtained when
the input lead is that of a semi-inﬁnite polymer, and the output lead
is that of a semi-inﬁnite C60 chain or SWNT.

The conductance of electron and hole charge carriers is then
obtained by simply evaluating the transmission at their associ-
ated Fermi levels εe
F, respectively. However, to under-
stand the origin of diﬀerences in conductivity between the various
donor/acceptor bulk heterojunctions considered herein, we shall
ﬁnd it useful to also consider the transmission within an energy
window around the acceptor’s VBM and CBM. In this way, we
may diﬀerentiate between diﬀerences in conductivity owing to an
improved level alignment between donor and acceptor, an increased
overlap of their levels, or a greater number of available transmission
channels.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To quantify the diﬀerences in electronic properties among the
donors (PT, P3MT, and P3HT) and acceptors (C60 chain, (6,4),
(6,5), and (10,5) SWNTs), we ﬁrst consider the energy gaps for the
isolated polymers and the band gaps of the isolated fullerene chain
and SWNTs. Among the three functionalized thiophene polymers
considered, both the calculated Kohn-Sham (KS) energy gaps and
those measured via photoluminesence 21,24,25 diﬀer by less than 50
meV, with the largest diﬀerence from polythophene (PT) occurring
with the ﬁrst methyl functionalization group (P3MT). For this rea-
son, along with the accompanying reduction of computational ef-
fort, we shall restrict consideration from hereon to PT and P3MT
as donors.

The acceptors considered have been intentionally chosen to pro-
vide a range of electronic band gaps, as shown in Table 1, from 1

eV for the (10,5) SWNT to 1.9 eV for the C60 chain. In each case,
the calculated KS band gaps diﬀer from the ﬁrst E11 transition mea-
sured in photoluminescence (PL) experiments 26,51 by ∼ 25%. This
is consistent with previous results, and may be addressed through
many-body GW corrections to the self energy. 52–54 However, for
our purposes, it is more relevant to note that the diﬀerence is rather
systematic among the carbon-based materials considered herein.

A more reliable descriptor for diﬀerences in exciton binding be-
tween bulk heterojunctions is the triplet excited-state formation en-
ergy E f (↑↑), provided in Table 1. This is obtained from the total
energy diﬀerence between a system in the triplet excited state and
the singlet ground state, that is, E f (↑↑) = E(↑↑)− E(↑↓). Because
E f (↑↑) depends only on DFT total energies and not on KS eigen-
values, this quantity is in principle exact up to the approximation
for the xc-functional.
Comparing the measured E11 transition energy and the calcu-
lated triplet formation energy E f (↑↑) for the isolated C60 chain

and (6,5) SWNT, we ﬁnd that their diﬀerence is ∼ 0.4 eV. This
is consistent with the measured singlet exciton binding energy in
SWNTs. 3–7 Although diﬀerences between the excited singlet and
triplet states may occur, this demonstrates that the triplet excited
state provides a reasonable approximation to the singlet excited
state for fullerenes and SWNTs. For the (6,4) SWNT, we obtain
a somewhat smaller energy diﬀerence (0.3 eV), while for the (10,5)
SWNT it is signiﬁcantly reduced to 0.1 eV. The latter is related
to the reduction of the E11 transition energy for the (10,5) SWNT,
while the E f (↑↑) is unchanged relative to the (6,5) SWNT. Alto-
gether, this is indicative of a strong exciton binding in the isolated
C60 chain, (6,4) SWNT, and (6,5) SWNT, with a much weaker ex-
citon binding in the (10,5) SWNT. This suggests that charge sepa-
ration for isolated SWNTs may be easier for those with a smaller
band gap.

To compare performance between diﬀerent acceptors in bulk het-
erojunctions, we ﬁnd it is more relevant to compare the diﬀerence
between the triplet formation energy of the acceptor in the bulk
heterojunction and in isolation. For a type II bulk heterojunction, a
lower triplet formation energy in the bulk heterojunction suggests
the hole is transferred to the donor. From Table 1 we see that E f (↑↑)
is reduced for all the acceptors studied when in the bulk hetero-
junction. Furthermore, the triplet formation energy is in all cases
lower for the P3MT bulk heterojunction than the PT bulk hetero-
junction. We also clearly see that the C60 chain in the triplet state
is signiﬁcantly more stabilized upon inclusion in the PT or P3MT
bulk heterojunctions compared with the SWNTs. There, E f (↑↑)
is stabilized by ∼ 0.1 eV upon inclusion in a PT bulk heterojunc-
tion and a further 0.1 eV for the P3MT bulk heterojunction, for all
three SWNTs studied. Qualitatively, this suggests a signiﬁcantly
greater electron–hole separation for the C60 chain compared with
the SWNTs, which should all be rather similar, with P3MT bulk
heterojunctions having a more facile electron–hole separation than
PT bulk heterojunctions.

Alternatively, we may describe the degree of electron–hole sep-
aration directly by quantifying the charge transfer in the bulk het-
erojunction. This is obtained by partitioning the DFT all-electron
density between the donor and acceptor species in the bulk hetero-
junction via a simpliﬁed Bader analysis. The charge transfer from
donor to acceptor for each bulk heterojunction in the triplet excited
state, singlet ground state, and their diﬀerence, is provided in Ta-
ble 2.

From Table 2 we observe the following trends in the charge trans-
fer: (1) It is always from donor to acceptor, (2) it is always more
for P3MT than PT bulk heterojunctions by about −0.1 e, (3) for
SWNTs it is always about −0.25 e for P3MT bulk heterojunctions
and −0.17 e for PT bulk heterojunctions, and (4) it is signiﬁcantly
greater (−0.5 e) for C60 chains. All four ﬁndings are consistent with
our previously mentioned expectations based on the triplet excited-
state formation energy.

It is useful to consider the spatial distribution of the diﬀerence in

4

all electron density between triplet excited state and singlet ground
state shown in Figure 1 to determine the origin of these trends in the
bulk heterojunctions’ charge transfer. For each bulk heterojunction
studied, the hole density is mostly localized on the π-bonding high-
est occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of PT or P3MT, with the
electron density on π antibonding levels of the C60 chain or SWNT.
Comparing the PT and P3MT bulk heterojunctions, we notice that
the hole density clearly extends onto the methyl groups of P3MT.
We expect this spatial delocalization of the hole density onto the
methyl groups of P3MT makes hole transfer easier in P3MT than
PT bulk heterojunctions. For the (6,4), (6,5) and (10,5) SWNT bulk
heterojunctions, the electron and hole densities shown in Figure 1
are rather consistent, with the electron density on the upper surface
of the SWNT neighboring the PT or P3MT. Conversely, for the C60
chain, the electron density is delocalized over the entire surface of
all three fullerenes. This suggests the greater charge transfer onto
the C60 chains compared with the SWNTs may have a geometrical
origin.

F and hole εh

However, although these results clearly demonstrate a charge
transfer from donor to acceptor, it remains unclear whether the
excited electron and hole are truly free charge carriers or remain
bound at the donor/acceptor interface. To address this issue, we
provide the zero-bias conductance at the energy of the excited elec-
tron εe
F in the singlet ground state and triplet excited
state in Table 3.

Note that these conductances are across a single fullerene/polymer
or SWNT/polymer junction. This is because within the NEGF for-
malism, the fullerene chain, SWNT, and polymer are all modeled
as semi-inﬁnite leads. For this reason, the conductances provided
in Table 3 may be considered to be per absorbed photon. Further-
more, because there is only a single PT or P3MT band for this
energy range through which current may ﬂow, the quantum of con-
ductance, G0 = 2e2/h, provides a theoretical upper bound on the
conductance across the junction.
Overall, the conductances quoted in Table 3 vary by over 6 or-
ders of magnitude, from G0 × 10−7 to 0.1G0. Particularly impres-
sive is the (6,4) SWNT/PT junction, with conductances of 9 and
5% of G0 for free hole and electron carriers, respectively. While
the (6,4) SWNT junctions clearly provide the highest conductivity
in the triplet excited state, the C60 chain/P3MT junction is clearly
the most active in the singlet ground state. Comparing the con-
ductance for the junction in the singlet ground state and the triplet
excited state, we ﬁnd that the conductance is generally signiﬁcantly
greater when the system is in the triplet excited state. This suggests
that the level hybridization related to the charge transfer observed in
Figure 1 facilitates tunnelling across the donor/acceptor gap. How-
ever, the opposite is true for the C60 chain/P3MT junction. We
also ﬁnd the (6,5) and (10,5) SWNTs, with their smaller band gaps,
have quite low conductivities. This is consistent with recent experi-

mental ﬁndings, which showed that (6,5)SWNT/PCBM/P3HT bulk
heterojunctions perform rather poorly. 22

To provide insight into the reasons behind the great variability
in the free carrier conductance provided in Table 3 and the ori-
gin of the high conductance across the (6,4) SWNT junctions in
the triplet excited state, we plot the transmission function T (ε) =
Tr[GC ΓinG†
Γout] near the VBM and CBM for the C60/polymer and
SWNT/polymer junctions in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.

C

For the C60/polymer junction, depicted schematically as an inset
in Figure 2(a), we provide the conductance through the polymers
(PT→PT and P3MT→P3MT), along the C60 chain (C60 →C60),
and across the junction (PT→C60 and P3MT→C60). The trans-
mission along the polymers is simply G0 for energies below the
HOMO, zero within the energy gap, and G0 above the lowest unoc-
cupied molecular orbital (LUMO). This amounts to a simple count-
ing of the number of bands below the VBM and above the CBM.

5

In the singlet ground state, the HOMO of PT/P3MT is pinned
to the LUMO of C60 at the Fermi level, while in the triplet excited
state, the LUMO of PT/P3MT becomes pinned to the LUMO of
C60 at the Fermi level of the excited electron εe
F. This means any
diﬀerences in band gap between PT and P3MT do not play an im-
portant role for the polymer/fullerene bulk heterojunctions, as the
donor HOMO and LUMO are pinned to the LUMO of the acceptor
in the ground and excited states, respectively.

Conduction through the C60 chain is rather diﬀerent. It instead
exhibits narrow plateaus centered on the HOMO and LUMO of the
C60 chain. As a result, conduction across the polymer/fullerene
junction is limited to these narrow plateaus where the C60 chain
is conductive, as shown in Figure 2a,b. It is this limitation in the
conductivity of C60 chains, which limits their eﬀectiveness within
OPV bulk heterojunctions and motivates their replacement with
SWNTs. 21

Unlike the C60 chain, the transmission through semiconducting
SWNTs exhibits broad plateaus, and is typically 2G0 below the
VBM, zero within the band gap, and 2G0 above the VBM. As was
this case for transmission through the polymers, this amounts to
a simple counting of the number of bands below and above the
VBM and CBM, respectively. Because the transmission through
the polymers and SWNTs is rather trivial, up to scattering due
to transmission across the junction, it has been omitted in Fig-
ure 3.
Instead, we plot the HOMO, singly occupied molecular
level (SUMO), singly unoccupied molecular level (SOMO), and
LUMO energies below/above which the transmission from PT→PT
and P3MT→P3MT is G0 in Figure 3a–d.

For the SWNT/polymer junctions, we ﬁnd the conductance is
intimately related to the alignment of the SWNT/polymer HOMO
and LUMO levels (cf. Figure 3a–d). In fact, the conductance at εe
F
and εh
F depends exponentially on the alignment of the SWNT and
polymer HOMOs and LUMOs. 55

For the (6,4) SWNT, with a KS band gap a bit smaller than PT
and P3MT, we ﬁnd both the HOMO and LUMO levels of the poly-
mer and SWNT are aligned in the triplet excited state. Although the
resulting charge transfer is rather similar to the other SWNTs stud-
ied (cf. Table 2), the improvement in level alignment places εh
F and
εe
F at or near the polymer HOMO and LUMO, respectively. This
results in a very high conductivity across the (6,4) SWNT/polymer
junctions in the triplet excited state (cf. Table 3). Conversely, the
level alignment for the (10,5) SWNT is the poorest of those con-
sidered, as the CBM of the nanotube is shifted down relative to the
LUMO of the polymer as the band gap decreases.

In fact, if the transmission was measured above or below the
polymer LUMO or HOMO, respectively, the conductance across
all three polymer/SWNT junctions studied would be > 1% of G0.
This is not the case for the C60 chain, which is only conductive
within a narrow range of the chain’s HOMO and LUMO.

Essentially, the conductance across SWNT/polymer heterojunc-
tions can be dramatically improved by a better alignment of the
polymer’s HOMO and LUMO levels with the SWNT’s VBM and
CBM, respectively. This may be accomplished using a SWNT with
a larger band gap, for example, a (6,4) SWNT. However, improving
the level alignment too much may lead to a reduction of the electron
and hole transfer.

4. CONCLUSIONS

We have employed four descriptors: (1) the triplet state formation
energy E f (↑↑), (2) the donor to acceptor charge transfer, (3) the
conductance of free electron carriers G(εe
F), and (4) the conduc-
tance of free hole carriers G(εh
F), to assess the relative performance
of OPV bulk heterojunctions with PT and P3MT as donors, and

6

C60 chains, (6,4), (6,5), and (10,5) SWNTs as acceptors. We ﬁnd
P3MT, with its larger band gap, and greater ability to absorb a hole,
generally exhibits a greater charge transfer and conductance than
PT. The C60 chain accepts signiﬁcantly more charge (−0.5 e) than
the SWNTs (−0.25 e), which are rather consistent for all SWNTs
considered. These results are also consistent with the calculated
formation energies for the triplet excited state.

However, the conductance across the junctions via free hole and
electron carriers diﬀers by six orders of magnitude among the bulk
heterojunctions considered here. In the singlet ground state the C60
chain/P3MT junction has the greatest free hole and electron con-
ductivity of those considered (0.03 and 0.01% of G0), while the
(6,4) SWNT/PT junction shows a dramatic increase in conductivity
in the triplet excited state (9 and 5%). This suggests that by improv-
ing the level alignment of the polymer and SWNT through the use
of larger band gap SWNTs one may obtain a dramatic improvement
in OPV eﬃciency.

Altogether, these results demonstrate the importance of consid-
ering the hybridization of donor/acceptor levels in the excited state,
and the resulting dependence on level alignment of the conductivity.
This dramatic dependence on the level alignment observed herein
provides signiﬁcant motivation for future studies including the de-
pendence on the vibrational modes of the molecules, 27 and more
advanced quasiparticle calculations including anisotropic screening
eﬀects 56–60 in the polymer/SWNT level alignment. Furthermore,
a reformulation of the NEGF method to describe photoinduced
quantum transport is required to describe the optical absorption-
dependent photovoltaic eﬃciency of OPV devices. The techniques
employed herein provide a roadmap for the computational design
of OPV bulk heterojunctions in silico.
