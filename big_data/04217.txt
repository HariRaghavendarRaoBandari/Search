Abstract. Spectrum Broadcast Structures are a new and fresh concept in the
quantum-to-classical transition,
introduced recently in the context of decoherence
and the appearance of objective features in quantum mechanics. These are speciﬁc
quantum state structures, responsible for an apparent objectivity of a decohered state
of a system. Recently they have been shown to appear in the well known Quantum
Brownian Motion model, however the ﬁnal analysis relied on numerics. Here, after a
presentation of the main concepts, we perform analytical studies of the model, showing
the timescales and the eﬃciency of the spectrum broadcast structure formation. We
consider a massive central system and a somewhat simpliﬁed environment being
random with a uniform distribution of the frequencies.

1. Introduction

A measurement in quantum mechanics typically alters a state of the system, so that if
several observers try to measure a certain observable they will in general interfere with
each other. This is in stark contrast with classical world, where properties of systems
such as position, momentum, etc can be in principle observed by as many observers
as one wishes, they will all agree on the results (modulo eventual reference frame
transformations), and moreover will not disturb the system. This observer-independence
and non-disturbance may be taken as a basis of an intuitive deﬁnition of objectivity.
Thus a problem arises: How can one explain the observed objectivity of everyday world
with quantum mechanics? It can be seen as one of the aspects of the quantum-to-
classical transition—a problem present from the very beginning of quantum mechanics
[1].

One of the prominent attempts to address this problem has been known as quantum
Darwinism [2].
It is a reﬁned and more realistic version of decoherence theory (see
e.g.
[3, 4, 5]), where one realizes that often observations are made indirectly, through
portions of the environment rather than by a direct interaction with the object (e.g.
an illuminated object scatters photons, which are then detected by the eyes of the
observers). Hence, the environment is no longer treated merely as a source of noise
and dissipation but is recognized as an important ”information carrier”. This implies a
paradigmatic shift in the main object of studies in the theory of open quantum systems—
from the reduced state of the system ̺S alone [3, 4, 5] to a joint state of the system
and an observed fraction f E of the environment ̺S:f E. Objectivity is then linked to
”information redundancy”: If the environment acquires in the course of the decoherence
a large number of copies of the state of the system and this information can be read out
without disturbance, then the state of the system becomes objective [2]. In pictorial
terms, objective becomes information about the system which not only ”survives” the
interaction with the environment, but manages to proliferate in the latter. As a measure
of this eﬀect a family of scalar criteria based on the quantum mutual information has
been proposed. The criteria check for a change in the quantum mutual information
I(̺S:f E) between the system and a fraction of the environment as a function of this
fraction size (e.g. a number of scattered photons taken into account in f E). If at some
point no change is produced while increasing the fraction size (and the so called classical
plateau appears on partial information plots), it is then concluded that environment
stores a largely redundant amount of information about the system state (more precisely
about pointer states to which the system decoheres).

This approach has been reconsidered in [6] on a ground that scalar criteria, and
quantum mutual information in particular, might not be the right tools and more
convincing arguments for information proliferation are needed, preferably on the most
fundamental level available—that of quantum states. Such an approach has indeed
been proposed in [6] (for a somewhat complementary approach see [7]). Starting from
an intuitive deﬁnition of objectively existing state of the system [2, 8] it has been shown

Analytical studies of Spectrum Broadcast Structures in Quantum Brownian Motion

that, under certain assumptions, it singles out a structure of a partially reduced state
of the system and the observed fraction of the environment compatible with objectivity
to the following one, called Spectrum Broadcast Structure (SBS):

̺S:f E =Xi

pi|iihi| ⊗ ̺E1

i ⊗ . . . ⊗ ̺EM

i

,

̺Ek
i ̺Ek

i′6=i = 0,

(1)

i

i

where |ii is the pointer basis to which the system decoheres, pi are the initial pointer
probabilities and ̺Ek
are some states of the fragments of the environment E1, . . . , EM ∈
f E, which are supposed to be observed and hence cannot be traced out. The information
about the state of the system— the index i, is encoded in a number of copies 1, . . . , M
in the environment through the states ̺Ek
and can be perfectly recovered due to the
assumed non-overlap condition in (1) and without any disturbance (on average) to the
whole state ̺S:f E. By the foregoing discussion this leads to an apparent objectivity of
the state of the system. Quite surprisingly the converse is also true as shown in [6]
with a help of several assumptions. One of them is that ”non-disturbance” requirement
should be understood in the sense of Bohr’s reply [9] to the famous EPR paper [10]
and which has been further formalized in [11]. The other important assumption is a,
so called, strong independence condition, demanding that the only correlation between
parts of the environment is due to the common information about the system. Formally,
from quantum information point of view, states (1) realize a certain weak form of state
broadcasting [12], called spectrum broadcasting [13]: The spectrum pi of the reduced
state of the system ̺S is present in many copies in the environments E1, . . . , EM and can
be retrieved from there by projections on the supports of ̺Ek
(due to the non-overlap
condition in (1)). This broadcasting process can be also described by a channel [13]:

i

ΛS→f E(̺0S) =Xi

hi|̺S0|ii̺E1

i ⊗ · · · ⊗ ̺EM

i

,

(2)

where ̺0S is the initial state of the system. Thus, objectivity can be seen a s a result of
a certain broadcasting process given by the channel (2).

The power of the above result is that it links objectivity and quantum state
structures in a completely abstract, model
independent way. A natural question
then arises if those structures appear in the canonical models of decoherence [3]:
collisional decoherence, Quantum Brownian Motion (boson-boson), spin-spin and spin-
boson models. So far the ﬁrst two models were analyzed and the answer is in general
aﬃrmative: There exists parameter regimes of the models such that SBS are formed.
The ﬁrst studied example was the famous illuminated sphere model of collisional
decoherence of Joos and Zeh [14]. Following the quantum Darwinism inspired analysis
of [15], it has been shown in [16] that indeed spectrum broadcast structures (1) are
asymptotically formed in the course of the evolution, even if the environment is noisy
(initially in a mixed state) and the appropriate time scales were given.
Important,
from the perspective of the current work, are the methods introduced for checking
for the SBS, which will be reviewed in the next chapter. The sphere model, however
illustrative, is rather simple since the system has no self-dynamics. More realistic, and
richer, in this sense is Quantum Brownian Motion, where a central harmonic oscillator

Analytical studies of Spectrum Broadcast Structures in Quantum Brownian Motion

is linearly coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators. This is arguably one of the most
popular models describing quantum dissipative systems. Despite its long history [17],
only recently studies of the informational content of the environment has appeared
[18, 19, 20, 21]. The ﬁrst two works analyzed both numerically and analytically (in the
massive central system regime) the scalar condition of quantum Darwinism, assuming
initially pure environment and squeezed state of the system and showing that indeed the
characteristic classical plateau is being formed. On the other hand in [20, 21] the model
has been analyzed from the SBS perspective and, under somewhat similar conditions as
above but with thermal environment, a numerical evidence have been found that indeed
there are parameter regimes so that a SBS is formed. A distinctive feature of the found
structure is that it is dynamical and evolves in time: The pointer basis in (1) rotates
in time according to the self-Hamiltonian of the central oscillator and at any instant a
SBS is being formed, encoding traces of this motion. One has to stress that due to the
mentioned paradigmatic shift in the treatment of the environment, i.e. it may contain
useful information, one cannot assume it to be so inert as not to feel the presence of the
system, as it is done in the usual Born-Markov approximation and master equation
approach to open quantum systems (see e.g.
[3] for an introduction and standard
applications). Thus, in particular our study of Quantum Brownian Motion does not
rely on the Born-Markov approximation and master equation methods, but rather on
a direct state analysis (the details are presented in Section 3). The drawback of the
previous studies [20] is that the analysis of the SBS formation was at the end performed
numerically. Here, continuing the previous research, we overcome this diﬃculty and
show analytically that there is a parameter regime of the model such that a dynamical
SBS is formed. We give analytical expressions for the decoherence and the SBS formation
time-scales in both low- and high-temperature regimes.

2. Checking for Spectrum Broadcast Structures

The method of detection of SBS developed so far [16, 21] is rather direct and most
naturally apply to the situation when the system-environment interaction is of the von
Neumann measurement type:

N

ˆYk,

(3)

ˆHSE = ˆX ⊗

Xk=1

where ˆX, ˆYk are some observables of the system and the k-th environment respectively,
assumed for simplicity to have discrete spectra. Albeit of a special form, this class
of Hamiltonians is of a fundamental
importance both for the decoherence [3] and
measurement [23] theories and thus worth investigating. To illustrate the method, we
will neglect here the self-Hamiltonians of the system and the environment (quantum
measurement limit) as one can then calculate everything explicitly. The resulting unitary
evolution given by (3) is of a controlled unitary type, where the system controls the

Analytical studies of Spectrum Broadcast Structures in Quantum Brownian Motion

environments through eigenvalues ξ of ˆX:

ˆU(t) =Xξ

|ξihξ| ⊗ ˆU1(ξ; t) ⊗ · · · ⊗ ˆUN (ξ; t),

ˆUk(ξ; t) ≡ e−iξt ˆYk/.

(4)

Assuming, as it is usually done, a fully product initial state ̺0S ⊗ ̺01 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ̺0k, one
immediately obtains that after the tracing of some portion of the environment, denoted
(1 − f )E and containing a fraction f N, 0 < f < 1 subsytems, the state reads:

where:

trh̺0ke−i(ξ−ξ′)t ˆYk/i(8)
is the usual decoherence factor between the states |ξi, |ξ′i. A check for the SBS (1)
proceeds in two steps.

trh ˆUk(ξ; t)̺0k ˆUk(ξ′; t)i = Yk∈(1−f )E

First of all the coherent part (7), containing entanglement between the system and
the environment, should vanish and this is of course the usual decoherence process,
controlled by Γξ,ξ′(t). If one is able to show |Γξ,ξ′(t)| = 0 with time for all diﬀerent pair
of ξ, ξ′, one proves that decoherence has taken place and |ξi becomes the pointer basis.
Second, we check if the information deposited in the environment during the
if the system-dependent states of the

i.e.

decoherence can be perfectly read out,
environments:

̺ξk(t) ≡ Uk(ξ; t)̺0kUk(ξ; t)
have non-overlapping supports (cf. (1)):

̺ξk(t)̺ξ′k(t) = 0,

(9)

(10)

and hence are perfectly one-shot distinguishable. Among diﬀerent measures of
distinguishability [22], the most suitable turns out to be the generalized overlap

(5)

(6)

(7)

(11)

B(̺1, ̺2) ≡ trq√̺1̺2√̺1.

This is due to the fact that most interesting are the situations when the interaction with
each individual portion of the environment in (3) is vanishingly small (see e.g.
[14]).
Then, one cannot expect (10) to hold at the level of single environments. Right to the
contrary, since each of the unitaries ˆUk(ξ; t) weakly depends on the parameter ξ, the
states ̺ξk(t) are almost identical for diﬀerent ξ’s. In other words, the information about
ξ is diluted in the environment. However, it can happen that by grouping subsystems
of the observed part of environment f E into larger fractions, called macrofractions mac

and introduced in [16], one can approach the perfect distinguishability (10) at the level
of macrofraction states ̺mac
such tests due to its factorization with the tensor product:

(t) ≡ Nk∈mac ̺ξk(t). Generalized overlap is well suited for

Summarizing, if one is able to prove that for some time both functions vanish

(13)

then from (6,7) this is equivalent to the formation of the spectrum broadcast structure

The introduced above grouping into macrofractions (or equivalently coarse-graining
of the observed environment) can be seen as a reﬂection of detection thresholds of real-
life detectors, e.g. an eye. Since one is usually interested in a thermodynamic-type
of a limit N → ∞ it is important that those fractions scale with N (hence the name
”macrofractions”).

where ˆX, ˆP are the position and momentum of the central oscillator of mass M and
frequency Ω, ˆxk, ˆpk are the positions and momenta of the bath oscillators, each with
mass mk and frequency ωk, and Ck are the coupling constants. This model can be in
principle solved explicitly either directly [17] or using Wigner functions [24]. However,
as unlike in the standard treatments we are interested here not merely in the reduced
state of the central oscillator alone, but in the joint state of the central and a part of
bath oscillators, the mentioned exact methods do not produce manageable solutions. As
already stated in the Introduction, the standard master equation methods are of no use
either, since we are primarily interested in the inﬂuence of the system on the environment
and not the other way around. Following this ”inverted” logic, one can try to eliminate,
at least in the ﬁrst approximation, the recoil on the system due to the environment
(apart from the renormalization of the frequency). This suggest a greatly simplifying
assumption of a massive central system [18, 19], which we will adopt. One can then
use a non-adiabatic version of the Born-Oppenheimer (Non-Born-Oppenheimer, NBO)
approximation (see e.g. [25]), where the central system evolves unperturbed, according
to its self-Hamiltonian ˆHS = ˆP 2/(2M) + MΩ2 ˆX 2/2 (with the renormalized frequency

k)) and the environment follows this evolution in the following
way. The system propagator Kt(X; X0) ≡ hX|e−i ˆHSt/|X0i is rewritten with the help
of the classical trajectory X(t; X0), starting at t = 0 at X0 and reaching X at time t
(as it is well known for the oscillator this semi-classical approximation is exact; see e.g.
[26]) and this trajectory acts as a classical driving force for the environment through
the coupling term, leading to a controlled evolution:
∂
∂t|ψE(t)i = ˆHE (X(t; X0))|ψE(t)i,

system-environment state is then constructed using the Born-Oppenheimer type of an
ansatz:

with |φS0i,|ψE0i being the initial states of the system and the environment respectively,
and ˆUE(X(t; X0)) is a solution of (16).

From the type of the coupling in (15) and the analysis of the previous Section
it follows that the candidates for the pointer states will be related to the position
eigenstates. Hence, initial states of the system with large coherences in the position
are of the greatest interest and for the purpose of this study we choose an initially
momentum-squeezed ground state as the initial state of the system (studies of the
initially position-squeezed state from [20] suggest that there is no SBS formation; cf.
[19]). This reduces the classical trajectories to X(t; X0) = X0 cos Ωt [18, 19] and in this
case the evolution (17) can be formally re-written using [20]:

ˆUS:E(t) =Z dX0e−i ˆHS t/|X0ihX0| ⊗ ˆUE(X0 cos Ωt).

The driven evolution of the environment is easily solved and gives [20]:

The evolution (19) is formally a controlled-unitary type (4),

in which the
environment evolves accordingly to the initial position X0 of the central oscillator. To
study our central object—the partially reduced state (5), one should be careful with
the integral in (18) as not to loose the diagonal part (6). We rewrite the integral using
a ﬁnite division of the real line of X0 into intervals {∆i} with |X0ihX0| replaced by
orthogonal projectors ˆΠ∆ on the intervals ∆ (continuous distribution of X0 is recovered
in the limit of these divisions see e.g. [27]). The partially traced state then reads:

is the decoherence factor. Following the general procedure of Section 2, one has to
calculate it together with the generalized overlap (11) for the states (22): B(k)
(t) ≡
B(̺k(X0; t), ̺k(X ′
0; t)) as they serve as the indicator functions for the formation of
spectrum broadcast structures; cf.
(13). Assuming the environment oscillators are

We note that the factor coth (τT ωk) appearing in the decoherence factor is related to the

the environment, while information accumulation on its purity.

is nothing else but the purity tr(̺2

To proceed further with the analysis, one has to specify the environment. The
standard procedure [3, 4, 5, 17, 18, 19] is to pass to a continuum limit of frequencies ωk
and encode the properties of the environment in a speciﬁc continuous approximation to
k/(2mkωk)δ(ω−ωk) (e.g. in [18, 19] the Ohmic
spectral density has been chosen). In contrast, in [20] a somewhat diﬀerent idea has been
put forward: To keep the environment discrete but random, with frequencies ωk chosen

the spectral density function J(ω) =Pk C 2

Analytical studies of Spectrum Broadcast Structures in Quantum Brownian Motion

from some given ensemble. Randomness is needed to eﬀectively induce decoherence
in the spirit of [28], as the environment remains ﬁnite-dimensional. For deﬁniteness’
sake the simplest case has been studied, where the frequencies ωk are independently,
identically distributed (i.i.d.) with a uniform distribution over a ﬁnite interval [ωL, ωU ].
The interval is chosen so that the environment is oﬀ-resonant (cf. (24,26)), to avoid
decohereing of the system by a single environment, and ”fast”:

ωU , ωL ≫ Ω.

(27)

This choice of the environment may be considered as a direct, ”mechanstic”, as opposed
to the usual ﬁeld, treatment of the environment: The bath is a collection of identical
mechanical oscillators with masses mk and random frequencies ωk.
It leads to a
complication in the study of the conditions (13) as from (23, 24) and (12, 26) the
macroscopic indicator functions, associated with the traced over part of the environment
(1 − f )E and an observed macfraction mac respectively:

become almost periodic functions of time. Previously [20] those functions were studied
only numerically,
indicating that indeed there is a parameter regime that the time
averages over very long times of the above (non-negative) functions simultaneously
vanish, indicating small typical ﬂuctuations above zero. This in turn, implies that the
partially traced state (21) approaches dynamical spectrum broadcast form with respect
to the initial position X0:

̺S:f E(t) ≈ Z dX0 |hX0|φ0i|2 e−i ˆHSt|X0ihX0|ei ˆHS t ⊗

⊗ ̺mac1(X0; t) ⊗ · · · ⊗ ̺macM(X0; t),

(30)

with ̺mack (X0; t) having non-overlapping supports. The dynamical character of the
above structure is manifest in the time dependence of all the appearing states: The
pointer basis is rotating according to the system self-Hamiltonian (thanks to the recoil-
free assumption) |X(t)i ≡ e−i ˆHSt|X0i and this motion modulates the evolution of
the environment in such a way that an instantenous SBS is formed at any moment.
In a sense, the environment encodes the motion of the central oscillator. The main
parameters this process depends on through (28,29) are time, temperature, separation
∆X0 ≡ |X0 − X ′
0| [21], and macrofraction size Nmac. Trade-oﬀs between them dictate
if and when the structure (30) will be formed. In what follows we study this behavior
analytically, assuming large macrofraction size Nmax.

4. Analytical estimates of the SBS formation

frequencies ωk with some distribution P (ω). As a consequence, the functions
i.i.d.
f B
T (t; ωk) and f Γ
T (t; ωk), appearing in the SBS indicator functions (28,29), also become
i.i.d. random variables for a ﬁxed time t and temperature T . Analytical study of their

unobserved macrofraction (1 − f )E as well as each of the observed ones have the same

Law of Large Numbers (LLN) [29]. This will be our main tool. It states (in its strong
form) that the macrofraction averages 1/NmacPNmac

fT (t; ωk) a.s.→ Z dωP (ω)fT (t; ω) ≡ hhfT (t; ω)ii

(31)

(we will be neglecting the superscripts Γ, B unless it leads to a confusion) and, according
to the large deviation theory, the probability of error is exponentially small in Nmac with
the rate governed by the, so called, rate function (which we will not be interested in
here, only assuming that it exists and is non-zero). This allows us to approximate the

sums PNmac

k=1 fT (t; ωk) with Nmac hhfT (t; ω)ii.

We note that the invocation of LLN is, in this context, eﬀectively equivalent to
the continuous limit for the macrofractions of the environment with P (ω) determining
the spectral density. In other words, we divide the environment into fractions of such
a large size that the LLN may be applied. Following our approach, explained in the
previous Section, instead of the standard spectral densities, such as e.g. Ohmic, we will
use here a much simpler, uniform probability distribution over an interval [ωL, ωU ] due
to an ease of analysis:

hhfT (t; ω)ii =

1

∆ω Z ωU

ωL

dωfT (t; ω),

(32)

where ∆ω = ωU − ωL. In what follows we analyze the short- and long-time behavior
of this expression in the limits of high and low temperature. This will enable us to
estimate the macrofraction size Nmac needed in order for the functions (28,29) to attain
asymptotically values close to zero within a given error as well as give the timescales of
their initial decays, observed numerically in [20].

4.1. Low temperature

Let us ﬁrst assume that the temperature is so low, that the associated thermal energy
is much lower than the lowest oscillator energy: kBT ≪ ωL. Then in the leading order
the temperature dependence can be neglected coth(ωk/2kBT ) ≈ tanh(ωk/2kBT ) ≈ 1
and the behavior of decoherence and orthogonalization becomes identical:

f Γ
T (t; ωk) ≈ f B

T (t; ωk) ≈ |αk(t)|2 ≡ f0(t; ωk)

(33)

Analytical studies of Spectrum Broadcast Structures in Quantum Brownian Motion 11

with αk(t) given by (20). The calculation of the ensemble mean of f0(t; ωk) is rather
lengthy and is presented in Appendix C, with an assumption that the interaction

strengths Ck obey (cf. [18, 19]) Ck = 2p(Mmk ¯γ0)/π, with ¯γ0 a constant.
First, we are interested in the short-time behavior, valid for times much shorter
than the shortest timescale of the full Hamiltonian, which in this case is t ≪ ω−1
U (we
recall that we assume Ω to be much lower than the environmental frequencies in order
to be in the oﬀ-resonant regime, so that collections rather than individual environments
matter). By expanding the expression for hhf0(t; ω)ii in power series with respect to
time, we ﬁnd after a tedious calculation that (for details see Appendix C eq. (C.10)):

hhf0(t; ω)ii =

2M ¯γ0
π∆ω

log(cid:18)ωU

ωL(cid:19) t2 + O(t4),

which immediately implies that the initial behavior of both the decoherence and the
orthogonalization factors is a Gaussian decay (c.f. (24, 26)):

∆X0M ¯γ0

We note that it depends on the macrofraction size and the separation through the
product ∆X0√Nmac. Thus, in order to keep the same time-scale for small separations
the macrofraction size should increase quadratically with decreasing separation.

The initial Gaussian decay (35) by no means guarantees that the functions will
stay close to zero with negligible ﬂuctuations—revivals are possible, as has been shown
in [20]. Thus a long-time analysis is needed, governed in our case by the condition
t ≫ 1/(ωL − Ω) ≈ 1/ωL as Ω ≪ ωL The detailed calculation is tedious and is given in
the Appendix C, eq. (C.11). The result reads:

hhf0(t; ω)ii =

where:

(40)

Interestingly, for large times the mean has an oscillatory part with the system frequency
Ω, but for fast environments (27) this part is vanishingly small as A0 ≈ 0. The above
formulas allow us to solve a very important problem in the context of SBS: How big
should be choose macrofractions in order to get decoherence and orthogonalization with
a prescribed error ǫ (common in the low T limit for both functions):

|ΓX0,X ′

0(t)|, BX0,X ′

0(t) < ǫ.

(41)

Analytical studies of Spectrum Broadcast Structures in Quantum Brownian Motion 12

This in turn will determine the trace norm distance of the actual state ̺S:f E(t) to the
spectrum broadcast form. From (37) and (28,29) we immediately obtain that if:

then the functions will be bounded by (41) for all times t ≫ 1/(ωL− Ω). This result can
be treated as an analytical proof of SBS formation in the studied regime. Similarly to
0(t) is governed
the short-time decay (35), the asymptotic behavior of |ΓX0,X ′
by the product ∆X 2
0 Nmac, so that the increase of the macrofraction size is quadratic with
decreasing the spatial resolution of the SBS. This ﬁnite spatial resolution of the SBS
for a given error level and a macrofraction size is a manifestation of the ”macroscopic
objectivity” idea, introduced in [21] for simpliﬁed models of QBM. Namely, for a given
tolerance ǫ and a macrofraction size, the objective state of the system appear only on
the length scales greater than ones given by (42).

4.2. High temperature

Here we consider the opposite situation of a hot environment: kBT ≫ ωU . Intuitively,
a formation of the SBS should be quite compromized now, as high temperature, while
increasing the decoherence power of the environment through the increase of its energy
appearing in (24), decreases its information capacity, by decreasing the purity, on which
depends the orthogonalization factor (26). Indeed, this is what we show below. In the
leading order tanh(τT ω) = [coth(τT ω)]−1 ≈ τT ω and (24) and (26) read:

1
τT ωk|αk(t)|2,
f Γ
T (t; ωk) ≈
T (t; ωk) ≈ τT ωk|αk(t)|2.

The relevant means (32) can be calculated analytically again; see Appendix D.1 and
Appendix D.2. For short time-scales t ≪ ω−1
U we obtain the following behavior (for the
details see Appendix D, eq. (D.12), (D.23)):

(43)

However, this time the timescales are diﬀerent. For the decoherence one obtains (cf.

(50)

As one would expect, the key diﬀerence is in the temperature dependence through
the the thermal time τT = /(2kBT ). While τdec decreases as T −1 indicating faster
decoherence with higher temperature, τort ∼ T so that it may even happen that
the orthogonalization timescale τdec/√Nmac is larger than the validity of the short-
time approximation t ≪ ω−1
so that the short-time
is valid, puts a constraint on the
approximation, and hence the Gaussian decay,

We observe that unlike in the low T regime, the decoherence asymptotic keeps oscillating

while AB ≈ 0. We are now ready to solve the problem of the SBS formation in the high
temperature regime: In a given temperature T , how big should be the macrofraction
sizes to achieve decoherence and distinguishability, and hence the SBS, on a length-scale

where N Γ
mac is the size of the traced-over part of the environment (1 − f )E and N B
mac
is the size of (each of) the observed macrofraction. As predicted, keeping all other
parameters ﬁxed, the observed macrofraction size in high temperature must be much
larger than the unobserved one in order to come close to SBS. Indeed, from the above
results those sizes scale like the thermal-to-central-system energies:

Ω.

5. Conclusions

We have studied the process of formation of the spectrum broadcast structures in
Quantum Brownian Motion model, continuing the research initiated in [20]. Being
interested in the information gained by the environment about the system, we have
considered a rather non-standard limit of a massive central system (initially in the
momentum squeezed state), and somewhat simpliﬁed random environments with i.i.d.
uniformly distributed frequencies. The use of the Law of Large Numbers, assuming
the environment to be suﬃciently large, allowed us to obtain analytical results on the
spectrum broadcast structure formation.

In particular, we have investigated short-time behavior of decoherence and
generalized overlap factors in low and high temperatures.
In the low temperature
regime, we have shown that both factors admit Gaussian decay with the same timescale,
which depends on frequencies of unobserved environmental oscillators only. In the high
temperature regime they also decay in a Gaussian way. However the resulting timescales
are diﬀerent functions of temperature:
the decoherence rate is proportional to the
temperature, whereas the rate of decay of generalized overlap is inversely proportional
to temperature. This explains in a quantitative way previous numerical simulations
showing rapid decoherence and vanishing orthogonalization of remaining environmental
states in the studied model with growing temperature for ﬁxed number of environmental
systems.

Long-time analysis gave us the eﬃciency of the spectrum broadcast structure
formation in the sense of the required observed/unobserved macrofraction sizes to obtain
decoherence and the environmental state distinguishability within given errors. In low
temperatures these sizes are equal, but, as one would expect, in high temperature they
have the opposite temperature dependence as hot environments decohere the central
system eﬃciently but encode a vanishingly small amount of information due to high
noise.

An obvious generalization of the present work would be an analysis of more standard
environment models, e.g. the Ohmic one with a cut-oﬀ. The resulting functions will
be more complicated but we believe still analyzable, at least in certain approximate
regimes, similar to the studied above.

Appendix B is devoted to Sine and Cosine Integrals. In Appendix B.1 we introduce
notation for particular combinations of Sine and Cosine integrals that appear in

behavior of this functions are presented. Appendix C contains details of computations
for low-temperature Quantum Brownian Motion. The high-temperature case is treated

Appendix B.1. Notation

It will prove beneﬁcial for the sake of clarity to introduce the following notation for
combinations of Sine and Cosine integrals:

FSi(±,±,±,±) = [±1,±1,±1,±1] ·
[Si ((ωL − Ω)t) , Si ((ωU − Ω)t) , Si ((ωL + Ω)t) , Si ((ωU + Ω)t)]T

(B.2)
where [±1, . . . ± 1] is a vector, · denotes vector product and T stands for transposition.
The argument of FSi(±,±,±,±), FCi(±,±,±,±) speciﬁes signs’ pattern of functions
e.g.:

Now we turn our attention to short-time behavior of the mean. We expand the above
expressions up to the second order in time. This is a good approximation for t ≪ ω−1

(D.12)

In the case of long-time behavior, one reaches a similar qualitative conclusion as for
low-temperature case. Namely, for t ≫ (ωL−Ω)−1 I3 ≈ 0 and I4 ≈ 0 so the only relevant
terms are I1 and I2, what results in the following expression for long-time behavior of
the mean

where this time
