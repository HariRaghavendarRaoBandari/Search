Abstract

With only the tree level operator, the decay of Λb → pK is predicted to be one order smaller
than the experimental data. The QCD penguin eﬀects should be taken into account.
In this
paper, we explore the one-loop QCD corrections to the decay of Λb → pK within the framework
of QCD factorization approach. For the baryon system, the diquark approximation is adopted.
The transition hadronic matrix elements between Λb and p are calculated in the light front quark
model. The branching ratio of Λb → pK is predicted to be about 4.85 × 10−6 which is consistent
with experimental data (4.9 ± 0.9) × 10−6. The CP violation is about 5% in theory.

INTRODUCTION

The weak decays of the heavy baryon Λb provide an ideal place to extract information
about the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) parameters and explore the mechanism of
CP violation complementary to the B meson system. For the non-leptonic processes, the
strong interaction dynamics is very complicated. Thus, these processes are also good probes
to test diﬀerent QCD models and factorization approaches. In early works of [1, 2], the weak
decay of Λb to Λc and light baryons (p, Λ) are systematically studied. The hadronic transition
matrix elements parameterized by form factors are calculated by use of a light-front quark
model (LFQM) [3–8]. Since there are three valence quarks in a baryon, the quark-diquark
picture was employed for simpliﬁcation. It is found that the diquark approximation not only
greatly simpliﬁes the calculations, but also gives well theoretical predictions.

With a simple factorization hypothesis, many non-leptonic processes of Λb to a light
baryon and a meson are calculated in [1]. The theory predictions of branching ratios are well
consistent with the experiment data except one process of Λb → p K −. The theory result is
Br(Λb → p K −) = 2.58×10−7, which is one order smaller than the data (4.9±0.9)×10−6 [9].
What is the reason? In fact, the physics reason had been discussed in [1]. The calculations
are performed at the tree level. In most cases, the tree operator contribution is dominant.
However, for the Λb → p K − process, the tree level contribution is suppressed by the CKM
matrix elments VubV ∗
us. For the penguin diagram, the main contribution comes from the loop
where top quark is the dominant intermediate fermion. The CKM entry would be VtbV ∗
ts
which is almost 50 times larger than VubV ∗
us. Thus even though there is a loop suppression
of order αs/4π, it is compensated by the much larger CKM parameter, so the contributions
from penguin diagrams are dominant. The eﬀects of QCD penguin have been displayed in
B → πK processes. For example, the process of B0 → K +π− is QCD penguin dominated
and its branching ratio is (1.94±0.06)×10−5, while for a tree dominated process B0 → π+π−
with Br(B0 → π+π−) = (5.15 ± 0.22)× 10−6, the ratio is a factor of three smaller than that
of B0 → K +π−.
Using the method of perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach, Λb → p K − has been calcu-
lated in [10]. The result is 1.82 × 10−6 in conventional pQCD approach and 2.02 × 10−6 in
hybrid pQCD approach. We can see that it is smaller than a half of the experimental data
(4.9± 0.9)× 10−6. In this paper, we will study the QCD corrections in the decay Λb → p K −
at one-loop order within the framework of QCD factorization approach [11–14]. This factor-
ization approach provides a systematic method to treat the non-factorizable QCD eﬀects.
It has been widely applied into many B meson non-leptonic processes. We will employ this
approach into the heavy baryon decays, the Λb → p K − process in this study.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we list the eﬀective Hamiltonian for the
transition Λb → p K −, give the QCD factorization approach to Λb → p K −, the decay rate,
and then discuss CP asymmetry and the relation to decay of ¯B0 → K −π+. In Section III, we
will give the numerical calculations. In Section IV, a discussion and conclusion is provided.

II. THE DECAY Λb → p K −

A. Eﬀective Hamiltonian for Λb → p K −
In the decay Λb → p K −, the initial Λb and ﬁnal p are baryons with three valence quarks.
When the diquark picture is employed, i.e. the inner quark structure of Λb is b[ud] and p
is u[ud] where [ud] is a scalar diquark in this case and acted as a spectator. The eﬀective
Hamiltonian Hef f for b → s transitions can be written by:

Hef f =

Ou
2 = ¯sαγµLuβ · ¯uβγµLbα,

The usual tree-level W-exchange contribution in the eﬀective theory corresponds to O1 and
O2 emerges due to the QCD corrections. The QCD penguin operators O3 − O6 are

the quark ﬁelds that are active at the scale µ = O(mb), i.e. q′ = u, d, s, c, b. The diﬃcult
problem is how to calculate the hadronic matrix elements of the local eﬀective operators.

B. Λb → p K − in QCD factorization approach

The naive factorization neglects the strong interactions between the ﬁnal K meson and
two baryons. It is necessary to consider the non-factorizable contributions. There are several
approaches which are beyond the naive factorization. In this study, we use the method called
QCD factorization approach [11–14]. The QCD factorization proves that in the heavy quark
limit, the decay amplitude can be factorized into a product of hard scattering kennel and
non-perturbative part. The K meson and proton are both light hadron and energetic. The
interaction between them should be caused by large momentum transfer. Although the proof
is given for the B meson case, it would be valid for the baryon system, too. Since we adopt
the diquark approximation, the complications caused by more valence quarks nearly vanish.
The diquark, as a whole, seems to be a light quark (it should be noted that the diquark in
our case is a scalar while quark is a fermion). Thus, we assume that QCD factorization can
be applicable to Λb → p K −.
The diagram for the αs order QCD corrections to Λb → p K − is plotted in Fig. 1. The
ﬁst two rows represents one-loop vertex corrections and αs corrections to electromagnetic,
chromomagnetic dipole operators. The last row represents the hard spectator scattering. At
present, we don’t know the wave function for a baryon with a quark and a diquark. One may
use a meson like wave function, but a quantity like the decay constant is unknown. Thus, we
will neglect the hard spectator contributions. After this simpliﬁcation, the decay amplitude
of Λb → p K − can be written by

hp K −|Oi|Λbi = F Λb→p T 1

i ∗ fKΦK.

(6)

Here, F Λb→p represents the Λb → p form factors which will be deﬁned below; ∗ represents a
convolution in the light-cone momentum fraction space; T 1
i represents the four-quark hard
scattering kernel; ΦK represents the kaon meson light-cone wave function.

C. The decay rate

In Eq. (7), the ﬁrst factor hp|Jµ|Λbi in the hadronic matrix element is parameterized by
form factors. The calculations of these non-perturbative form factors is one essential work of
hadron physics. The form factors for the weak transition Λb → p are deﬁned in the standard
way as

The second factor of matrix element in Eq. (7) deﬁnes the decay constants as follows

hK −(P )|Aµ|0i = fKPµ.

(10)

In the above deﬁnition, we omit a factor (−i) for the pseudoscalar meson decay constant for
simpliﬁcation.
Substituting the expressions of hK − | ¯sγµ(1 − γ5)u | 0i and hp | ¯uγµ(1 − γ5)b | Λbi one

can obtain the decay amplitude of Λb → p K − as

M(Λb → p K −) = ¯up(A + Bγ5)uΛb,

where pc is the proton momentum in the rest frame of Λb.

D. CP asymmetry and relation to decay of ¯B0 → π+K −
The CP violation is deﬁned in the same way as PDG book [9] by

ACP ≡

Br(Λ0
Br(Λ0

b → p K −) − Br( ¯Λ0
b → p K −) + Br( ¯Λ0

b → ¯p K +)
b → ¯p K +)

,

(13)

At the quark level, the CP violation is represented by b quark decay minus ¯b quark. The
similar deﬁnition of CP violation for meson is

ACP ≡

Br( ¯B0 → f ) − Br(B0 → ¯f )
Br( ¯B0 → f ) + Br(B0 → ¯f )

.

(14)

Under the diquark approximation, the baryon is similar to a meson. In fact, at the quark
level, Λb → pK − has the same sub-processes b → su¯u as that in ¯B0 → π+K −. The amplitude
of ¯B0 → π+K − is

M( ¯B0 → π+K −) =

Compare it to Eq. (7), we can obtain a relation between the baryon and meson processes,

Br(Λb → p K −) = BrExp( ¯B0 → π+K −) ×

Brtree(Λb → p K −)
Brtree( ¯B0 → π+K −)

.

(16)

Where the ”tree” represents the branching ratio with only the tree operator contribution.
This relation will be used to estimate the branching ratio of Λb → p K − from the meson
process ¯B0 → K −π+. About the CP violation, under the above assumption, ACP in the two
processes should be equal.

(18)

Here, we take the value A = 0.822, λ = 0.22535, ρ = 0.155, η = 0.358.

By use of the above input parameters, we can get the Wilson coeﬃcients ai which is rele-
vant to the process of Λb → p K − with the αs order QCD corrections. The numerical results
are given in Table III. Considering the theoretical uncertainties, our results are consistent
with those in [13]. The small diﬀerence can be ascribed to the input parameters and the
hard spectator contributions we neglected. Although the scale µ dependence of the Wilson
coeﬃcients ai is reduced compared to the LO ones, there is still eﬀect which is not negligible.
This dependence implies the importance of higher order eﬀects.

Now, we can obtain the branching ratio of Λb → p K −. The predicted results at diﬀerent
scale µ are listed in Table IV. As discussed above, the results have an un-negligible depen-
dence on the choice of scale µ. The higher the scale is, the lower the prediction is. The
result at µ = mb/2 give prediction of 4.85 × 10−6 which is very well with the recent LHCb
data (4.9 ± 0.9) × 10−6. The good coincidence indicates that µ = mb/2 is more appropriate.
From phenomenological point of view, mb is the largest scale in b quark decay subprocess
and each quark in the ﬁnal hadrons does not carry the total momentum. The momentum
transfer between dirrerent quarks should be smaller than mb. So the choice of µ at µ = mb/2
is more reasonable than at mb.

Under the assumption by neglecting the strong interactions with the spectator quark (di-
quark for the baryon), Λb → p K − contains the same strong dynamics with ¯B0 → π+K −.
We can use the data of meson process to extract the strong interaction information. The
advantage of this method is that the scale µ dependence is eliminated and the theory un-
certainties of QCD factorization approach is reduced by experiment. By the aid of of the
experimental data of Br( ¯B0 → π+K −) and the Eq. (16), we estimate the decay rate with
Br(Λ0
b → p K −) = 4.82 × 10−6. It coincides with the experimental measurement very well.
The results of CP violation is displayed in Table V. Contrary to the branching ratio, the
numerical results of CP violation of Λb → p K − becomes smaller as the scale µ decreases.
At scale µ = mb/2, the CP violation is about 5%. The experimental data from LHCb is
0.37 ± 0.17 ± 0.03. The central value is several times larger than theory prediction. Because
the experimental error is still large, it’s too early to give a conclusion whether the theory
coincides with the experiment or not. It is interesting and necesaary to compare the CP
violation to the meson case. The data of CP violation in ¯B0 → π+K − is also provided
in Table V for comparison. The value is −0.080 ± 0.007 ± 0.003 with a negative sign. In
our calculations under the diquark approximation, the CP violation of ¯B0 → π+K − and
Λb → p K − should be equal. However, we see that the experimental data for the two
processes are quite diﬀerent, especially the sign is opposite. In fact, the CP violation for the
process of ¯B0 → π+K − in the QCD factorization approach is a challenging problem for a

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The weak decay of Λb contains fruitful information of strong interaction and provides
an important probe to test diﬀerent theory approaches. In this work, we extend the QCD
factorization approach to the heavy baryon decays, in particular the process of Λ0
b → p K −.
The previous literature considers only the tree diagram contribution and the theory result is
one order smaller than the experiment. The Λ0
b → p K − is a type of b → s transition which
the QCD penguin diagram contribution is more important than the tree diagram because of
the CKM parameter enhancement. The QCD correction is calculated to αs order and the
Wilson coeﬃcients at diﬀerent renormalization scale are given. For the baryon, the diquark
approximation is applied. The Λb → p form factors are calculated in the light-front quark
model. The branching ratio of Λ0
b → p K − is predicted to be 4.85 × 10−6 at scale µ = mb/2.
The theory coincides with the experimental data (4.9 ± 0.9) × 10−6 very well.
From the coincidence of theory and experiment, we can obtain some conclusions as fol-
lowing. (1) The perturbative contribution is dominant. The success provides a conﬁdence of
applicability of QCD factorization method to the more complicated heavy baryon processes.
(2) The choice of µ = mb/2 is appropriate. Because the largest scale is mb in the b quark
decay subprocess, the real momentum transfer cannot reach mb and should be smaller than
it. (3) The diquark ansatz works very well. The diquark approximation not only lead to a
clear physics picture but also a great simpliﬁcation for the numerical calculations. From this
study and the previous literatures on heavy baryon decays, we may say that the diquark is
really a working ansatz.

The main theory uncertainties come from several origins: the choice of scale µ, the Λ → p
form factors, and the non-perturbative power corrections. The problem of scale µ has been
discussed in the article. Its scale dependence is not negligible. The higher loop corrections
may help to reduce the dependence but are usually diﬃcult to be realized. Although the
Λ → p form factors depend on model calculations, the reliability can be ﬁtted by experiemnt.
In [1], it shows that our calculated Λ → p form factors give a well prediction for Λb →
p π−: the theory result of the branching ratio is 3.15 × 10−6 and the experimental data is
(3.5 ± 0.6(stat) ± 0.9(syst)) × 10−6. Thus, the model-dependent form factors don’t cause

large theoretical uncertainties. The higher power correction is diﬃcult to estimate. The
consistence of theory at µ = mb/2 with data indicates that the non-perturbative power
correction is less important and the perturbative contribution is dominant. One can use the
data from ¯B0 → π+K − to reduce the theory uncertainties in QCD factorization approach.
By this way, we obtain the decay rate with Br(Λ0
b → p K −) = 4.82 × 10−6 which coincides
the experiment very well.
About the CP violation, it provides us a very diﬀerent physics picture. Under the diquark
approximation and neglecting the spectator interactions, the theory predicts CP violation
b → p K − and meson case ¯B0 → π+K −.
at level of about 5% for both the baryon process Λ0
The origin of the strong phase in QCD factorization approach comes from the quark loop in
the vertex corrections. For the meson case, the theory result is positive. But the experiment
data is negative, about −10%. This obvious inconsistence implies the importance of non-
perturbative corrections for CP violation. For the baryon Λ0
b → p K −, the experiment data
gives a very large result: 0.37±0.17±0.03. In QCD factorization approach, the perturbative
contribution cannot reach 10%. Because it’s quite diﬃcult to estimate the non-perturbative
corrections, the prediction of CP violation in theory is a challenging research. We hope the
future LHCb data can provide us a more precise measurement of CP violation in Λ0
b → p K −
to improve the development of theory.

Note added

After we put the manuscript of this work on arXiv:1603.02800 [hep-ph],
we are noticed a similar research [18]. The authors had studied Λb → p M within the
generalized factorization approach. For the process of Λb → p K, the predicted branching
ratio and direct CP violation are similar to us. But it should be noted that the form factors
and the Wilson coeﬃcients in the two works are diﬀerent.
