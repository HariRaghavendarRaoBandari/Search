750 GeV Di-photon Excess and Strongly First-Order Electroweak Phase Transition

(Dated: March 16, 2016)

A new scalar particle, coupled to photons and gluons via loops of vector-like quarks, provides a
simple theoretical interpretation of the 750 GeV di-photon excess reported by the experiments at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this paper, we show that this model contains a large, phe-
nomenologically viable parameter space region in which the electroweak phase transition (EWPT)
is strongly ﬁrst-order, opening the possibility that electroweak baryogenesis mechanism can be real-
ized in this context. A large coupling between the Higgs doublet and the heavy scalar, required for
a strongly ﬁrst-order EWPT, can arise naturally in composite Higgs models. The scenario makes
robust predictions that will be tested in near-future experiments. The cross section of resonant
di-Higgs production at the 13 TeV LHC is predicted to be at least 20 fb, while the Higgs cubic
self-coupling is enhanced by 40% or more with respect to its Standard Model (SM) value.

Introduction — Experiments at the Large Hadron Col-
lider (LHC) have recently reported an intriguing hint of
a new resonance in the diphoton channel with an invari-
ant mass of approximately 750 GeV [1, 2]. If true, such
a resonance could not be explained within the Standard
Model (SM) of particle physics. Many theoretical in-
terpretations of this signal in terms of physics beyond
the SM have already been proposed. A simple and com-
pelling interpretation is to postulate the existence of a
new scalar (spin-0) particle, X, with mX ≈ 750 GeV,
which is singly produced as an s-channel resonance in
the collision of gluons, and decays directly into a pho-
ton pair. This scenario was explored, for example, in
Refs. [3–10].
(Production via photon collisions is also
possible, see e.g. [11–13], but will not be our focus in
this work.) While X itself does not have any SM quan-
tum numbers, its coupling to photons and gluons can be
mediated by loops of vector-like quarks (VLQ’s). This
simple structure can accommodate the observed dipho-
ton rate without contradicting the constraints on new
physics from the LHC Run 1 and elsewhere, and it arises
naturally in many new physics scenarios, including lit-
tle Higgs and composite Higgs models (see, for example,
Refs. [5, 9, 14, 15]).

The origin of the asymmetry between matter and
antimatter in the universe is one of the major open
questions in fundamental physics. Several mechanisms
that could generate this asymmetry have been proposed.
One of the most compelling scenarios, the electroweak
baryogenesis (for review, see e.g. Ref. [16]), requires
that the electroweak phase transition be strongly ﬁrst-
order.
In the SM, the transition from electroweak-
symmetric to electroweak-broken vacuum is known to be
a crossover [17], so that the electroweak baryogenesis sce-
nario cannot be realized. However, it is well known that
physics beyond the SM can change the nature of the tran-
sition.
In particular, the presence of extra scalar par-
ticles, with signiﬁcant interactions with the Higgs, can
trigger a strongly ﬁrst-order EWSB. In this paper, we
investigate whether the new scalar X, postulated to ex-

plain the 750 GeV diphoton excess, can play this role.
(For previous work on this subject, see Refs. [18, 19].)

Model — We introduce a real scalar ﬁeld S, which has
no SM quantum numbers. To avoid large mixing between
S and the SM Higgs H, we impose a reﬂection Z2 sym-
metry, under which S → −S and all SM ﬁelds, including
H, are even. The tree-level scalar potential has the form
S4 + λSH S2|H|2.
Vtree = −µ2|H|2 + λ|H|4 +
(1)
This is the most general renormalizable potential allowed
by the SM gauge symmetries and the Z2. Note that
no other renormalizable interactions of S with the SM
ﬁelds are allowed. The tree-level values of the parameters
known from experiment are µ ≈ 88 GeV, λ ≈ 0.13, and

(2)
where v ≈ 246 GeV is the SM Higgs vacuum expectation
value (vev). In our analysis, we will treat λSH as a free
parameter, and use (2) to ﬁx µS. The value of λS has
only a marginal eﬀect on the quantities of interest to us,
and we ﬁx it at 1.0 throughout the analysis.

In addition, we introduce a VLQ ﬁeld, a Dirac fermion

Q, with a Yukawa coupling to the S:

L ⊂ mQ ¯QQ + yQS ¯QQ.

(3)

We postulate that the left- and right-handed components
of Q have opposite charges under the Z2 symmetry, for
example QL → QL and QR → −QR. Then, the Yukawa
coupling is Z2-invariant, and the symmetry is only broken
softly by the VLQ mass term. We assume this breaking
to be spontaneous, i.e. the VLQ mass term arises from
a Z2-breaking vev of an additional scalar ﬁeld; in this
case, the Z2 is fully restored above the scale mQ. To me-
diate S interactions with gluons and photons, Q needs
to be colored and electrically charged; for concreteness,
we assume that SM quantum numbers of Q are (3, 1)5/3.
Such charge-5/3 quarks are common in composite Higgs

models. In the parameter range of interest, the interac-
tions of S with gluons and photons can be expressed in
the eﬀective operator formalism, by integrating out the
VLQ:

(5)

The VLQ loops will also induce the couplings of S to Zγ
and ZZ pairs.

Radiative corrections involving VLQ loops induce Z2-

violating terms in the scalar potential:

V/Z2 = a1S + a3S3 + δ1S|H|2.

(6)

The coeﬃcients a1 and a3 are induced at the one-loop
level. Using mQ as the ultraviolet cutoﬀ in the loop inte-
grals (since the Z2 symmetry is restored above this scale)
yields an estimate

a1 =

(7)

where A and B are order-one coeﬃcients that depend on
the details of the sector responsible for spontaneous Z2
violation at the scale mQ. The value of B has very small
eﬀect on our analysis, and for concreteness we set it to
1. We treat A as a parameter; however, note that values
of A far below 1 require ﬁne-tuning. The coeﬃcient δ1 is
ﬁrst generated at the two-loop level, and is numerically
negligible.

The tadpole term in the potential (6) inevitably causes
S to get a vev, which in turn induces a mixing of S and
H. Working to linear order in the small Z2-breaking
parameters, we obtain

(8)

Here θSH is the angle of rotation between the gauge
eigenbasis (S, h) and the mass eigenbasis (φ, X), with
mφ = 125 GeV and mX = 750 GeV:

φ = cos θSH h − sin θSH S,
X = sin θSH h + cos θSH S.

(9)

The parameter space region of interest for our analysis

has |(cid:104)S(cid:105)| <∼ 20 GeV, |θSH| <∼ 4 × 10−3, which justiﬁes
treating the Z2 breaking as a small perturbation.

With the assumptions outlined above, the model has
three input parameters, (λSH , mQ, yQ), in addition to the
constant A. An alternative basis is (λSH , κ, cg), where

κ ≡ a1/3
. In this basis, A only aﬀects the VLQ mass at
each parameter point, but is otherwise irrelevant, making
it a convenient choice.

LHC Phenomenology— A combined ﬁt to the event
rates of the 750 GeV diphoton excess seen at ATLAS
and CMS yields [4]

σ(pp → X) Br(X → γγ) = (4.4 ± 1.1) fb.

(10)

For illustration, we will use the central value in our nu-
merical analysis. We use Eq. (10) to ﬁx cg in terms of
the other two parameters, λSH and κ. The observed di-
photon spectrum has a slight preference for a non-trivial
X width of about 50 GeV; however, the statistical sig-
niﬁcance of this hint is small, and we do not use this
information in this study.

In addition to photon pairs, in our model X can decay
to gg, ZZ and γZ pairs through VLQ loops. The singlet-
doublet mixing also induces Higgs-like decay modes such
as X → t¯t, W +W −, and provides an additional (in fact,
dominant) contribution to X → ZZ. Finally, the S vev
as well as the mixing contribute to the decay X → φφ.
Rates in all these channels are constrained by searches
at the LHC Run-I; the strongest constraints on our
model are imposed by the ATLAS searches in the di-
Higgs [20, 21], W +W − [22, 23], and ZZ [22, 24] chan-
nels. In addition, the production and decay rates of the
125 GeV state, φ, are aﬀected by the doublet-singlet mix-
ing. The fractional deviations of the couplings of the 125
GeV state to photons and gluons from their SM values
are given by

κγ ≈ 1 + 12.0 cγθSH ,

κg ≈ 1 − 118 cgθSH .

(11)

Shifts in all other couplings are much smaller, being ei-
ther quadratic in the mixing angle θSH , or additionally
suppressed by loop factor(s). ATLAS and CMS ﬁts to
the Higgs data in the “loop-only new physics” frame-
work [25, 26] can then be used to place constraints on
our scenario.

The constraints imposed by the Run-I data are shown
in Fig. 1. The strongest constraints come from the
searches for W +W − and di-Higgs resonances at 750 GeV;
the ZZ channel and the 125 GeV Higgs decays are cur-
rently less constraining. Also shown are the contours of
VLQ mass, for A = 1 (top panel) and A = 0.1 (bot-
tom panel). For comparison, direct searches for VLQs of
charge 5/3 at the LHC Run-I place a lower bound on this
mass of 0.75 − 1.0 TeV in the simplest models where the
VLQ decays into a W boson and an SM quark.

Electroweak Phase Transition — Dynamics of the elec-
troweak phase transition is determined by the eﬀective
ﬁnite-temperature scalar potential:

Veﬀ (S, H; T ) = Vtree(S, H) + VCW(S, H) + VT (S, H; T ).
(12)
Here VCW is the Coleman-Weinberg potential which in-
cludes quantum corrections at zero temperature, while

3

while being accurate enough for our purposes.
(For a
more detailed discussion of these issues, see Ref. [30].)
For top and scalar-loop contributions to VT , we include
the full thermal functions, JB/F (x), without using high-
temperature approximations. We also include the “daisy
resummation” terms in VT , which capture the leading
corrections beyond the one-loop order [28, 29]. To study
the dynamics of the phase transition numerically, we
adopt the code used previously in Refs. [27, 30]. The
algorithm computes the eﬀective potential as a function
of temperature T , starting from low initial T and in-
creasing it in small increments. It searches for the criti-
cal temperature Tc, deﬁned as the temperature at which
Veﬀ (S, H; Tc) has two degenerate local minima, one with
(cid:104)H(cid:105) = 0 and one with (cid:104)H(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0. The procedure is re-
peated for a large set of points in the input parameter
space, (mQ, λSH ). If the search for Tc yields no result,
we conclude that no ﬁrst-order transition occurs at that
point. If the algorithm does ﬁnd a critical point, we com-
pute

v(Tc)

,

Tc

ξ =

(13)
where v(Tc) is the value of (cid:104)H(cid:105) in the local minimum
where it is non-zero. A necessary criterion for elec-
troweak baryogenesis is ξ >∼ 0.6 − 0.9; for smaller values

of ξ, sphaleron transitions inside the electroweak-broken
phase wash out the baryon asymmetry. We will adopt
this criterion and refer to points where it is satisﬁed as
having a “strongly ﬁrst-order” phase transition. Note
that non-zero values of (cid:104)S(cid:105) at one or both degenerate
minima would generally be present in our model. The
numerical algorithm automatically accounts for this by
searching for local minima in the two-dimensional ﬁeld
space. However, (cid:104)S(cid:105) does not aﬀect the sphaleron rate
and therefore does not enter our criterion for a strongly
ﬁrst-order transition.

the model (solid lines; the regions above and to the right
of the lines are ruled out). Contours of the constant VLQ
mass (in GeV) are also shown, with A = 1.0 (top panel)
and A = 0.1, corresponding to 10% ﬁne-tuning of the singlet
tadpole (bottom panel).

VT is the ﬁnite-temperature eﬀective potential. We com-
pute both VCW and VT at the one-loop level, including
contributions from the SM top and electroweak gauge
bosons, as well as S itself.
In the case of electroweak
gauge contribution, we expand VT in gauge coupling con-
stants g and g(cid:48), and truncate the expansion at order
g2. This avoids well-known diﬃculties that stem from
gauge-dependence of the full gauge contribution to VT ,

The regions in the parameter space with a strongly
ﬁrst-order EWPT are displayed in Fig. 2, together with
the constraints from X and φ decays. The key obser-
vation is that there is a region where all these require-
ments are compatible. In the limit of small κ, ﬁrst-order
EWPT is achieved for λSH >∼ 4.5, which is in good
agreement with the analysis of a Z2-symmetric model in
In the presence of Z2-violating terms in the

potential, a ﬁrst-order EWPT can occur for smaller val-
ues of λSH . However, given the LHC constraints on the
doublet-singlet mixing, the minimum λSH can only be
reduced by about 10%.

A large value of λSH required for a ﬁrst-order EWPT
raises questions concerning the validity of perturbative
analysis. A naive estimate, λSH <∼ 4π, leaves open a
broad range of λSH with a ﬁrst-order EWPT. This esti-
mate can be reﬁned by considering the singlet contribu-
tions to the one-loop Higgs potential, in particular the
Higgs quartic coupling renormalization [31]. The mini-

mal values of λSH that produce a ﬁrst-order EWPT in
our model correspond to ∆λ ∼ 0.3 − 0.4, which appears
to be safely perturbative. Thus, we conclude that the
use of perturbation theory in our analysis is justiﬁed,
although more work would be needed to establish the
upper bound on λSH beyond which a non-perturbative
approach would be required.

Comparing Figs. 1 and 2 indicates that without ﬁne-
tuning in the singlet tadpole (A ∼ 1), the VLQ mass
in the region where a ﬁrst-order EWPT occurs is in the
500 − 600 GeV range. This is ruled out in the simplest
models, although the bounds may be relaxed in more
complex models with non-SM decay channels for VLQ.
(For an example of such phenomenology in the case of
charge-2/3 top partners, see [32].) If 10% ﬁne-tuning in
the singlet tadpole is assumed, the VLQ mass in the re-
gion of interest is about 1 TeV, allowed by the current
searches even with conventional VLQ decays. Note that
the VLQ mass decreases with decreasing κ, so that direct
VLQ searches imply more ﬁne-tuning at lower κ. For this
reason, the region κ <∼ 100 GeV (not shown in the plots)
is disfavored. The values of the VLQ Yukawa coupling
yQ (see Eq. (3)) in the region of interest are ∼ 1.0 − 2.0
for A = 1, and ∼ 2.0 − 4.0 for A = 0.1. While higher
degree of ﬁne-tuning in the singlet tadpole would further
relax the bounds from direct VLQ searches, perturba-
tivity of yQ serves as a limiting factor, especially since
renormalization group evolution leads to further increase
in yQ with energy [33].

Predictions for Future Experiments — The strongly
ﬁrst-order EWPT scenario in our model produces spe-
ciﬁc predictions that can be tested in future colliders.

probing the scalar potential. In particular, the cross sec-
tion for resonant di-Higgs production at 750 GeV at the
13 TeV LHC is >∼ 20 fb throughout the parameter space
with a ﬁrst-order EWPT; see Fig. 3. This prediction will
be tested very soon.
It is, however, somewhat model-
dependent, since the rate would be reduced if non-SM
decay channels of S are present. A more robust pre-
diction concerns the deviations in the cubic self-coupling
of the 125 GeV Higgs boson, which are predicted to be
at the level of about 40% or more, see Fig. 4. This is
yet another example of a generic correlation found in
Ref. [34]. Deviations of this size can be probed by study-
ing double-Higgs production at the International Linear
Collider [35, 36] or a 100 TeV proton collider [37]. Many
other predictions of the model – the presence of VLQs
with masses around a TeV, W W and ZZ resonances at
750 GeV, and deviations in the 125 GeV Higgs couplings
to photons and gluons, typically at a few-% level – will
be tested at the LHC Run-II. While these predictions are
primarily sensitive to the size of the mixing angle θSH
and do not show a strong correlation with the ﬁrst-order
EWPT, these searches will of course play a crucial role
in testing the underlying framework.

Discussion — A 750 GeV gauge-singlet scalar particle,
coupled to gluons and photons through loops of vector-
like quarks, provides a simple interpretation of the LHC
diphoton excess. In this paper, we showed that such a
scalar can also lead to a strongly ﬁrst-order electroweak
phase transition, opening the possibility for the elec-
troweak baryogenesis mechanism to be realized. The sce-
nario requires rather large values of the singlet coupling
to the Higgs, λSH >∼ 5. Such couplings naturally arise in
composite Higgs models with compositeness scale around
a TeV, so that a ﬁrst-order electroweak phase transition
may in fact be a rather generic feature of such models.
(Of course, explaining the relatively low mass and small
quartic coupling of the Higgs doublet is more challenging
in this context.)

Beyond a ﬁrst-order EWPT, electroweak baryogenesis
scenario requires that additional sources of CP violation,
beyond that present in the SM, be introduced around the
weak scale. For example, this may be achieved if addi-
tional pseudo-scalar states are present in the spectrum,
as would typically be the case in composite Higgs mod-
els. A detailed analysis of possibilities for CP-violation
in this context would be well motivated.

The mechanism for strongly ﬁrst-order EWPT consid-
ered in this paper will be tested experimentally in the
near future. Among the various predictions made by the
underlying model, we identiﬁed two that appear to be
tightly correlated with the EWPT dynamics: the rate of
resonant di-Higgs signal at 750 GeV, and the deviation
in the Higgs cubic coupling. This highlights the power
of near-future experiments probing the Higgs sector to
shed light on the nature of the electroweak phase tran-

5

sition, and by extension on the viability of electroweak
baryogenesis mechanism.
