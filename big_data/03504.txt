Abstract

In this paper, an extension of the classiﬁcation of ﬂipped SU (5) heterotic-string vacua from [1]
with a variation of the SO(10) breaking α basis vector is presented. A statistical sampling in the
space of 245 ﬂipped SU (5) vacua is explored, where 1011 GGSO distinct conﬁgurations are scanned in
comparison to the 1012 GGSO distinct coeﬃcients scanned in the space of 244 vacua in [1]. A JAVA
code, akin to the one used for the classiﬁcation in [1], was implemented to explore these. Results
presented here indicate that no three generation exophobic vacua exist, which was also found to be
the case in [1] as all odd generations were projected out. This paper will also study the details on
the comparison between the two classiﬁcations achieved and then reﬂect on future directions in the
quest for ﬁnding three generation exophobic ﬂipped SU (5) heterotic-string models.

Introduction

To date vast amounts of work has been carried out using techniques in string model building to construct
physical spectrums consisting of 3 generations. Concrete examples of analysing semi-realistic string
vacua can be found in both symmetric and asymmetric Z2 × Z2 orbifold compactiﬁcations, especially
using the four-dimensional free-fermionic construction [2, 3, 4, 5] given by a worldsheet approach in the
heterotic string setting. Initially, the asymmetric Z2 × Z2 free-fermionic orbifold models corresponding
to the N = (2, 0) super-conformal worldsheet symmetry were studied from the late eighties. The gauge
group was the observable E8 in these cases, which was then broken to the SO(10) symmetry followed
by another breaking to its subgroup in the NAHE-based structure [6]. These subgroups consisted of the
ﬂipped SU (5) gauge group [7, 8], SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1)2 standard-like gauge group [9, 10, 11, 12, 13],
SU (3) × SU (2)2 × U (1) left-right symmetric gauge group [14, 15, 16], and the SO(6) × SO(4) Pati-Salam
gauge group [17, 18]. This aided in the development of the free-fermionic model building contemporary
research on exploring large classes of string vacua. In the late nineties, work focused on the symmetric
Z2 × Z2 free-fermionic orbifolds. These helped derive tools for the classiﬁcations, such as during the
last decade for the type II superstrings [19] and then extended to the heterotic-string free-fermionic
construction [20, 21, 22, 23, 24].

The free-fermionic classiﬁcations extracted many interesting properties including viable phenomenolog-
ical models at the string scale and beyond LHC physics predictions. Under the E6 and SO(10) GUT
symmetries, existence of a symmetry called the spinor-vector duality was shown in the space of Z2
and Z2 × Z2 string models. This symmetry generates the exchange of the vectorial 10 representa-
tions with the representations of the spinorial 16 plus anti-spinorial 16 under the SO(10) gauge group
[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. Such ﬁndings motivated further classiﬁcations, where then the
Pati-Salam SO(10) subgroup was investigated [32, 33]. Here the sectors containing only the massless
states revealed the existence of exophobic string vacua and therefore fractionally charged fermions (ex-
otics) [1, 5, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] only existed in the massive spectrum. It was also shown to generate
an abundance of 3 generation models. A detailed example of a phenomenologically viable 3 generation
Pati-Salam models can be found in [41]. Another detailed model was studied in [42], which enhanced
the Pati-Salam models to the SU (6) × SU (2) [42] maximal subgroup of the E6 symmetry. It was also
observed that an exophobic 3 generation model existed, admitting an anomaly free family universal U (1)

symmetry, which was additional to the U (1) generators of the SO(10) GUT symmetry [43, 44, 45, 46].
Later, the classiﬁcations undertaken for the ﬂipped SU (5) [1, 5] and the SU (4) × SU (2) × U (1) [5, 47]
SO(10) subgroup models, was shown to contain no exophobic 3 generation string vacua. The ﬂipped
SU (5) models contained only exophobic even generations, as all the exophobic odd generations where
projected out. As for ﬁnding 3 generation ﬂipped SU (5) vacua, models needed to be exophilic. The
SU (4) × SU (2) × U (1) models on the other hand, didn’t consist of any exophobic 3 generation vacua,
since in the massless spectrum all the right-handed particles were projected out, therefore it wasn’t pos-
sible to ﬁnd any generations. In fact, in the NAHE based basis vectors in [48], it was similarly shown
that 3 generation models are forbidden for the SU (4) × SU (2) × U (1) gauge group. A detailed discussion
on the free-fermionic landscape can be found in [5] and [49].

The free-fermionic classiﬁcations in [1, 5, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 33, 47] developed methodologies that
provided a pivotal tool set. This enabled an elegant way to analysing large sets of string vacua speciﬁc
to the free-fermionic construction. Analysis of large sets of string vacua carried out by other groups
can be found in [50]. In this paper, these techniques were used to analyse more large classes of string
vacua belonging to the ﬂipped SU (5) models. The SO(10) symmetry is constructed identical to [1] and
then is broken to the ﬂipped SU (5) with a variation of the SO(10) symmetry breaking α basis vector.
The diﬀerence between the two ﬂipped SU (5) models is the hidden gauge group being broken down
diﬀerently. Detailed properties of the ﬂipped SU (5) classiﬁcation under the variation of the SO(10)
symmetry breaking α basis vector followed by the discussion of the results for the existence of three
generation models in the free-fermionic landscape is presented. Comparison is then drawn between the
two explaining future directions to be taken.

2 The Free-Fermionic Flipped SU (5) Construction

The four-dimensional free-fermionic construction is represented in the light-cone gauge consisting of
20 real left-moving worldsheet fermions from ψµ
1,2, χ1,...,6, y1,...,6, ω1,...,6 and 44 real right-moving real
worldsheet fermions from y1,...,6, ω1,...,6, ψ1,...,5, η1,2,3, φ
. The worldsheet is given by a torus and as
the worldsheet fermions in the vacuum to vacuum amplitude are parallel transported along the two non-
contractible loops, they acquire a phase. Speciﬁc gauge groups under the modular invariance constraints
[2, 3, 5] are constructed by assigning particular choices of boundary conditions to the fermions in each
set of basis vectors. The basis vectors forming an additive group generates the entire string spectrum
consisting of 2N sectors in the space of Ξ, where N is the number of basis vectors. Here a sector is extracted
by a speciﬁc linear combination of the basis vectors and the space Ξ by all possible linear combinations
of the same basis vectors. The basis vectors also induces a speciﬁc generalised GSO projection on any
given string state |Sξ >, performed by an action. This can be written as

1,...,8

eiπvi·Fξ |Sξ >= δξ C(cid:18) ξ
vi(cid:19)∗

|Sξ >,

where the space-time spin statistics is given from δξ = ±1 and the fermion number operator is given by
Fξ. Each distinct string model is produced by varying the diﬀerent set of GGSO projection coeﬃcients

vi(cid:1) = ±1, ±i. Therefore, a model from the free-fermionic construction is given by a set of basis vectors
C(cid:0) ξ
vj(cid:1), i > j GGSO projection coeﬃcients.
v1, . . . , vN , a set of 2N (N −1)/2 string vacua and independent C(cid:0)vi

2.1 The α Basis Vector

As highlighted in [1], the choice of the basis vectors α that breaks the SO(10) symmetry to the SU (5) ×
U (1) gauge group is not unique. Although, the breaking to the SU (5) × U (1) symmetry is unique, the
diﬀerence lies in the breaking of the hidden gauge group. Here, the three complex worldsheet fermions
η1,2,3 = 1/2 boundary condition assignments is constrained by the term bj · α = 0 mod 1 given by
modular invariance. Whereas the ﬁve complex worldsheet fermions ψ1,...,5 = 1/2 boundary condition
assignments is ﬁxed to constructed the SU (5) × U (1) gauge symmetry. Therefore, the variation of the

2

α basis vectors exists in the assignment of the boundary conditions of the remaining eight worldsheet
complex fermions φ1,...,8.
In this case, modular invariance restricts the assignment of 1/2 boundary
conditions to 0, 4 or 8 worldsheet complex fermions of φ1,...,8. This leads to breaking the hidden gauge
group diﬀerently. The case with 0 enhances the SU (5) × U (1) gauge symmetry to SO(10) and therefore
is of no importance, the case with 4 was studied in [1] and in this paper, the α basis vector assigned with
1/2 boundary conditions to the 8 φ1,...,8 complex worldsheet fermions is presented, that is given by

α = {η1,2,3 =

1,...,5

}.

2.2 The Flipped SU(5) Basis Vectors

The SU (5) × U (1) models in the free-fermionic construction are obtained by the breaking of the SO(44)
gauge group to the SO(10) gauge group and then to the ﬂipped SU (5) by a series of basis vectors given
below:

v1 = S = {ψµ, χ1,...,6},

v1+i = ei = {yi, ωi|yi, ωi}, i = 1, . . . , 6,

v8 = b1 = {χ34, χ56, y34, y56|¯y34, y56, η1, ψ
v9 = b2 = {χ12, χ56, y12, y56|y12, y56, η2, ψ

v10 = z1 = {φ

v12 = α = {η1,2,3 =

}.

The SO(44) gauge symmetry is generated with the basis vector S that also makes the models N = 4
supersymmetric. In order to incorporate all the possible symmetric shifts from the six internal coordinates,
the next six vectors ei for i = 1, ..., 6 are formed, where the N = 4 supersymmetry is left intact together
with the breaking of the SO(44) gauge group to the SO(32)×U (1)6 symmetry. The set {b1, b2} leads to the
breaking of N = 4 to N = 1 supersymmetry, these vectors corresponds to the Z2 × Z2 orbifold twists that
also breaks the U (1)6 together with decomposing the SO(32) gauge symmetry to SO(10)×U (1)3×SO(16).
The SO(10) × U (1)3 group constructed here is deﬁned to represent the observable symmetry and the
other SO(16) group is deﬁned to represent the hidden symmetry. The set {z1, z2} is formed to further
break the SO(16) gauge group to the SO(8)1 × SO(8)2 symmetry. Lastly, as discussed before the α
basis vector breaks the SO(10) symmetry to the ﬂipped SU (5) group and then the overall gauge group
generated by the gauge bosons in the untwisted NS sector is given by

SU (5) × U (1) × U (1)3

× SU (4)1 × U (1)1 × SU (4)2 × U (1)2

Additionally, in order to satisfy the ABK rules [2, 3, 4, 5], the basis vector 1 must consist in the additive
group given by the above basis vectors. This is produced by the following sum

1 = S +

Xi=1

ei + 2α.

3 Classiﬁcation Methodology

The scanning of vast amounts of free-fermionic string vacua is facilitated by an advanced classiﬁcation
methodology, where the twisted sectors are identiﬁed and then deﬁned by the observable, hidden and
exotic sectors. These sectors are computed by the use of a written JAVA code which checks the viable phe-
nomenological properties. The observable sectors are scanned for chiral matter and Higgs states, whereas

3

the hidden sectors only contain SU (5) singlets and therefore are all neutral under all the observable U (1)s.
However, exotic sectors all contain fractionally charged massless fermion states [1, 5, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]
under the SU (5) × U (1) symmetry, as these representations do not fall into the Standard Model [40] or
its near predictions, they are all avoided in the scan for viable free-fermionic string vacua.

3.1 GGSO Projections Coeﬃcients

The free-fermionic string vacua is primarily deﬁned by the GGSO projection coeﬃcients c(cid:0)vi

in the one-loop partition function, are all free parameters. In order to extract viable phenomenological
models some of these GGSO projection coeﬃcients are ﬁxed. In total taking the coeﬃcients as spanning
a 12 × 12 matrix and then imposing modular invariance, only the elements belonging to i ≥ j are
independent. Moreover, the 66 lower triangle elements are deﬁned by the corresponding 66 upper triangle
elements. Including the remainder 12 diagonal elements, only 78 independent coeﬃcients are left as free
parameters. Further requirements such as imposing N = 1 space-time supersymmetry, ﬁxes the following
eleven coeﬃcients:

vj(cid:1) contained

C(cid:18)S

S(cid:19) = C(cid:18)S

ei(cid:19) = C(cid:18) S

bk(cid:19) = C(cid:18) S

zk(cid:19) = C(cid:18)S

α(cid:19) = −1,

This reduces the amount of free coeﬃcients to 67. The diagonal terms are ﬁxed by modular invariance
that are given as:

i = 1, ..., 5, k = 1, 2.

i6=j

1 =

Yj=1
bk(cid:19) = −
C(cid:18)bk

ei(cid:19),
C(cid:18)bk
C(cid:18)zk
ei(cid:19),
C(cid:18)α
ei(cid:19).

Here another eleven coeﬃcients are ﬁxed. After developments in the free-fermionic classiﬁcations, it was
found that additionally coeﬃcients do not aﬀect the free-fermionic string spectrums. Speciﬁc to the
models studied here, these are the following eleven coeﬃcients:

C(cid:18)ei

ei(cid:19), C(cid:18)e3

b1(cid:19), C(cid:18)e4

b1(cid:19), C(cid:18)e1

b2(cid:19), C(cid:18)e2

b2(cid:19), C(cid:18)b1
b2(cid:19),

Fixing these arbitrarily leaves in total 45 free parameters deﬁning the full spectrum. This corresponds
to 245 ≈ 3.52 × 1013 vacua in this class of free-fermionic superstring models.

i = 1, ..., 6.

3.2 Observable Matter Spectrum

The matter content arising from the string spectrum in the free-fermionic models is from the 27 repre-
sentation belonging to the E6 symmetry, which is then further broken to the SO(10) GUT symmetry at
the string scale. This leads to the particle content of the standard model to be found in the 16 spinorial
representations, whereas the light Higgs states is found in the 10 vectorial representations. The speciﬁc

4

sectors containing the chiral matter content in the symmetric free-fermionic constructions are generated
from the following equations:

B(1)

pqrs = S + b1 + pe3 + qe4 + re5 + se6

= {ψµ, χ12, (1 − p)y3y3, pω3ω3, (1 − q)y4y4, qω4ω4,

(1 − r)y5y5, rω5ω5, (1 − s)y6y6, sω6ω6, η1, ψ

},

(2)

B(2)
B(3)

pqrs = S + b2 + pe1 + qe2 + re5 + se6,
pqrs = S + b3 + pe1 + qe2 + re3 + se4.

Here p, q, r, s = 0, 1 and b3 = b1 + b2 + 2α + z1 + z2. These equations consist of 48 sectors that either
output the left- and right-handed particles from the 16 or the 16 spinorial representation of the SO(10).
Under the SU (5) × U (1) symmetry the SO(10) 16 and 16 representations decomposes as follows:

16 = (cid:0)5, − 3
16 = (cid:0)5, + 3

2(cid:1) +(cid:0)10, + 1
2(cid:1) +(cid:0)10, − 1

2(cid:1) +(cid:0)1, + 5
2(cid:1) ,
2(cid:1) +(cid:0)1, − 5
2(cid:1) .

3.3 The Enhancement Sectors

In the free-fermionic construction space-time vector bosons arise from the untwisted NS sector, generating
the SO(44) gauge group. This group is then broken to the ﬂipped SU (5) symmetry with a series of
GGSO projections with respect to the basis vectors as deﬁned in equation (1). However, the ﬂipped
SU (5) gauge group can then be enhanced to another gauge group depending on the GGSO projection
coeﬃcients chosen. This property emerges due to the extra space-time vector bosons arising from the
following sectors:

G = 


z1,
α,
3α,

z2,

z1 + α,
z1 + 3α,

z1 + z2,
z2 + α,
z2 + 3α,

z1 + z2 + 2α,
z1 + z2 + α,
z1 + z2 + 3α

.




In order to preserve the ﬂipped SU (5) symmetry, the imposed restriction here is that the only gauge
bosons that remain in the spectrum are those that are obtained from the untwisted NS sector and the
sectors that only enhance the hidden gauge group. The reason for allowing the enhancement of the hidden
gauge group is to provide extra freedom to ﬁnd three generation exophobic models which were not found
in [1] as will be discussed later.

3.4 Projectors

In equation (2), the sectors B(1,2,3)
pqrs produces matter states subject to surviving the GGSO projection. To
decide if the state is projected in or out, the GGSO projection coeﬃcients in relation to the basis vectors
e1, e2, z1 and z2 are checked. Therefore, generic formulas are deﬁned called the projectors, where P = 1
is the indicator for surviving states and P = 0 for projected out states. These projectors are given as:

Using methods developed in linear algebra, the JAVA code using these equations can easily check the
condition Rank(Matrix[∆i])=Rank(AugmentedMatrix[∆i, Y i]). Here when the condition is equal, the
computer code would instantly realise that there are 24−Rank(Matrix[∆i]) solutions and then after further
checking see if that particular model has any viable phenomenological properties, and therefore can decide
if to store the details of that model.

4 Classiﬁcation

An elegant technique in the classiﬁcation, is by use of the algebraic expressions as discussed in the pre-
vious section to analyse the entire massless free-fermionic string spectrum. These expressions are then
transformed into matrix equations that are solved by a JAVA code that randomly selects a conﬁgu-
ration of a set of GGSO projection coeﬃcients. The JAVA code is used to scan models in the space
of 245 ≈ 3.52 × 1013 string vacua. Since the entire string vacua is a large space, a random generator
was used to scan 1011 vacua that were randomly chosen in the total space of 245 vacua. However, the
classiﬁcation of ﬂipped SU (5) in [1] compared to here was also accomplished using a JAVA code that
scanned 1012 string vacua in the space of 244 vacua. The reason for having 45 free parameters here

compared to the 44 free parameters in [1] is due to the GGSO coeﬃcient C(cid:0)z2

the string spectrum unlike before. This is a property emerging from modular invariance that constrains
every GUT gauge group models diﬀerent from its given basis vectors. Therefore, a diﬀerent ﬂipped SU (5)
SO(10) breaking basis vectors was implemented here, to ﬁnd 3 generation models that were all projected
out in [1] in exophobic vacua. Furthermore, from every generated model desired phenomenological cri-
teria is analysed. As in the previous classiﬁcations, this paper also considers viable phenomenological
criteria as ﬁnding 3 generation models, GUT breaking heavy Higgs, electroweak breaking light Higgs,
exophobic vacua and anomaly free gauge group as its primary aim. For this reason, the observable sector
of a heterotic-string free-fermionic ﬂipped SU (5) model is characterised by the following 15 integers,
(n1, n1, n5s, n5s, n10, n10, ng, n10H , n5v, n5v, n5h, n1e, n1e, n5e, n5e):

z2(cid:1) being dependant on

n1 = # of (1, + 5
2 ),
n1 = # of (1, − 5
2 ),
n5s = # of (5, + 3
2 ),
n5s = # of (5, − 3
2 ),
n10 = # of (10, + 1
2 ),
n10 = # of (10, − 1
2 ),
ng = n10 − n10 = n5 − n5 = # of generations,
n10H = n10 + n10 = # of non chiral heavy Higgs pairs,
n5v = # of (5, +1),
n5v = # of (5, −1),
n5h = n5v + n5v = # of non chiral light Higgs pairs,
n1e = # of (1, − 5
4 )
n1e = # of (1, + 5
4 )
n5e = # of (5, − 1

n5e = # of (5, + 1

These numbers above are also identical to the criteria carried in [1] that are used for the classiﬁcation
and to extract viable data for low energy physics in the string scale. A unique feature is given from
the α projection that always projects the states n1, n5s and n1, n5s in or out together and therefore
are also given as pairs. This reduces the total number of integers determining viable vacua from 15 to
13. Additionally, the distinction is made with the ﬂipped SU (5) 5 and 5 representations decomposing
from the SO(10) spinorial 16 and vectorial 10 representations, where the Standard Model up-type quark
electroweak singlet and lepton-doublet is denoted by n5s and n5s respectively and the light electroweak
Higgs doublets is denoted by the pair n5v, n5v.
In order for the models to be semi-realistic, further
constraints are imposed on the integers given above, these include n5h = n5h, n1e = n1e and n5e = n5e.
This ensures that the ﬂipped SU (5) models are anomaly free. For the models to be phenomenologically

7

viable the following are also imposed:

Three light chiral number of generations,

ng = 3
n10H ≥ 1
At least one heavy Higgs pair to break the SU (5) × U (1) symmetry,
n5h ≥ 1
At least one pair of light minimal SM Higgs doublets,
n1e = n1e ≥ 0 Heavy mass can be generated for vector–like exotics,
n5e = n5e ≥ 0 Heavy mass can be generated for vector–like exotics.

This completes all the details necessary for the classiﬁcation of the ﬂipped SU (5) models to be carried
out and the methodology being applied. In the next section, the classiﬁcation results are given and a
discussion is carried out.

In this section, the classiﬁcation of the free-fermionic ﬂipped SU (5) string vacua is discussed and compared
to the one in [1], the classiﬁcation was carried out by statistical sampling 1011 models out of the 245 ≈
3.52 × 1013 vacua. In [1] the scan was carried out for 1012 models out of the 242 ≈ 1.76 × 1013 vacua.
The scan was accomplished here with a JAVA code similarly taken in [1], which essentially solved the
algebraic equations discussed in section 3.4 and checked for viable phenomenological data from the 13
integers discussed in the previous section. The JAVA routine was run using the nodes by the University
of Liverpool, Department of Physics ULGQCD cluster and several servers in the University of Liverpool,
Department of Mathematics. Results were gained in a week and are presented in this section with ﬁgures
1-3 and table 1.

In ﬁgure 1, the logarithmic distribution of the number of exophilic ﬂipped SU (5) models against the
number of chiral generations in a random sample of 1011 distinct conﬁgurations is displayed. The peak
is seen at 0 generations and as the number of generations increments the number of models decreases
logarithmic. The ﬁgure also presents the absences of 7, 9, 11, 13, 14 and 15 generations and it should
be noted that there are no models with greater than 16 generations. In comparison to ﬁgure 1 in [1], 16
generations models arise here and are excluded in [1], this is due to the extra freedom given by the hidden
gauge group enhancements. It is concluded here that no signiﬁcant changes are observed with a variation
of the ﬂipped SU (5) SO(10) breaking basis vector. Additionally, the results here are in agreement with
[1, 5, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 32, 33, 47, 49].

In ﬁgure 2, the logarithmic distribution of the number of exophobic ﬂipped SU (5) models against the
number of chrial generations in a random sample of 1011 distinct conﬁgurations is displayed. The striking
feature given in this ﬁgure is the repeat of the non-existence of three chiral generations from [1]. The
ﬁgure also presents the absences of odd generations, in addition to the exclusion of 14 and above 16
generations. In comparison to ﬁgure 2 in [1], 16 generations models again arise here and are excluded
in [1], due to the extra freedom given by the hidden gauge group enhancements. It is concluded that
no signiﬁcant changes are observed with a variation of the ﬂipped SU (5) SO(10) breaking basis vector
and results are in agreement with [1, 5, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 32, 33, 47, 49]. It should be emphasized
that these results hold in the space of models that were explored here and that it does not necessarily
indicate absence of 3 generation exophobic ﬂipped SU (5) models, however it might indicate the diﬃculty
of ﬁnding them if they exist.

In ﬁgure 3, the logarithmic distribution of the number of 3 chiral generations ﬂipped SU (5) models
against the number of exotic multiplets in a random sample of 1011 distinct conﬁgurations is displayed.
Similarly to [1], the ﬁgure shows that the minimal number of exotic multiplets is four, therefore as 3
chiral generations exist in exophilic ﬂipped SU (5) vacua and till experimental data can dictate otherwise,
all 3 chiral generations ﬂipped SU (5) models will be imposed with minimal exotic multiplets that being
four here.

Table 1: Table consisting of total number of viable ﬂipped SU (5) models with respect to the phenomeno-
logical constraints imposed given by a sequence of incrementing numbers. Details include: contraints
imposed with respect to low energy physics, remaining number of models with imposed contraints, prob-

the space of 245 vacua.

In table 1, the total number of viable ﬂipped SU (5) models with respect to the phenomenological con-
straints imposed given by a sequence of incrementing numbers is displayed. The column “Constraint”
shows the sequence of low energy physics constraints imposed. The column “# Of Models In Sample
Scanned” shows the remaining models in the scanned sample as each constraint is imposed. The column
“Probability” shows the probability of the occurrence of models with respect to the imposed constraints
in the sample scanned. The column “Estimated # Of Models In Class” predicts the number of models in
the entire space with such imposed constraints. The scan was carried out for a sample of 1011 vacua and
the tabulation initially after imposing that only anomaly free ﬂipped SU (5) models with no gauge group
enhancement of the four dimensional gauge symmetry, shows that only approximately 6.59×10−2% of the
models remain. Next, imposing the existence of both the heavy and light Higgs states to break the ﬂipped
SU (5) gauge symmetry to the Standard Model gauge group and the electroweak breaking respectively,
leads to a further reduction to approximately 1.60 × 10−5% remaining models. Additional reduction is
achieved by imposing minimal ﬂipped SU (5) heavy Higgs, SM light Higgs and minimal exotic states,
leaves 9.04 × 10−7% models. These models are believed to be semi-realistic models in nature, an example
of such a model is given by the following matrix of one-loop phases for a minimal three generation model:

The attribute of this models is ng = 3, n5s = 3, n5s = 0, n10 = 4, n10 = 1, n10H = 1, n5h = 4, n1e = 2
and n5e = 0. In conclusion, unlike the classiﬁcation of the free-fermionic Pati-Salam models [33], which
contained three chiral generation models free of massless exotic states, the free-fermionic ﬂipped SU (5)
models both in [1] and in this paper show that no three chiral generation models exist and that they

11

only exist with the inclusion of four exotic multiplets as given in the model above. Although this was a
surprising feature, however it is in line with related searches [51].

5 Conclusion

The Z2×Z2 free-fermionic orbifolds in four-dimensions that are given at special points in the moduli space,
has demonstrated many semi-realistic string models constructed to date [7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18]. This led to developing the symmetric Z2 × Z2 free-fermionic orbifold classiﬁcation methodology given
in [1, 5, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 41, 42, 47]. All these models adapted the classiﬁcation
methodology by containing the six additional basis vectors ei for i = 1, ..., 6 that consists of all the
possible symmetric Z2-shifts which are in the internal compactiﬁed directions. Moreover the ei basis
vectors allowed the writing of algebraic equations that could be written and calculated by a computer
code, which inevitably enabled the scanning of large number of free-fermionic string vacua. The ﬁrst
classiﬁcation in [20] scanned the chiral 16 and 16 spinorial SO(10) GUT representations, in order to
show viable phenomenology. The Higgs states were then tested in [22] with the scanning of SO(10)
GUT 10 vectorial representations. As more developments were made the spinor-vector duality [23, 24]
discrete symmetry was discovered using the x-map [25, 26]. From these developments the classiﬁcation
methodology was then known to elegantly extract the full massless spectrum from a given set of GGSO
coeﬃcient conﬁguration, with the writing of the GGSO projections in algebraic forms to be applied to a
computer code. As a result, the SO(10) models [31] were scanned in detail and became a success, as it
was shown to have an abundance of 3 generation models. When the classiﬁcation was done for a random
sample of 1011 string vacua, discrete properties began to emerge. Here, it was observed that the odd
generations above 5 vanished, whereas the even generations above 12 were incremented by 4 integers.

The advent of the SO(10) models saw the Pati-Salam models being investigated. Here, the Pati-Salam
models [33] contained identical discrete properties as the SO(10) models, with the exclusion of all the 24
generations, since they were all projected out. In this case, as the spinorial 16 representation of the SO(10)
was broken to the 4 and 4 representations transforming under the SU (4) of the Pati-Salam, therefore,
instead of one, two states were required to complete family of generations. However, the Pati-Salam
models also contained many 3 generations that were exophobic. Further to this, the ﬂipped SU (5) models
were then explored both in [1] and here. Contrary to the Pati-Salam classiﬁcation consisting of exophobic
3 generation models, the ﬂipped SU (5) models contained only 3 generation models with fractionally
charged exotic states, in a random sample of 1012 and 1011 string vacua scanned. An additional property
of the ﬂipped SU (5) models, is that it was more constrained, as the generations following a logarithmic
distribution together with all the odd generations being projected out. In hope of ﬁnding 3 generation
viable exophobic ﬂipped SU (5) string vacua, the next and ﬁnal ﬂipped SU (5) breaking basis vector is
under investigation, as discussed in section 2, this basis vector to construct such models are given by

α = {η1,2,3 =

1,...,5

, φ

= 1}.

Furthermore, in the event of not achieving the desired goal of ﬁnding 3 generation viable exophobic
ﬂipped SU (5) string vacua, the symmetric Z2 × Z2 free-fermionic orbifolds will be re-evaluated and a new
set of SO(10) breaking basis vectors will be constructed. In this new construction an additional hidden
gauge group breaking basis will be added to the ones in equation (1), which is given by

1,2

z3 = {φ

5,6

, φ

}.

However, it should be noted that models consisting of these three hidden gauge group breaking basis
vectors have not been studied before and are more complicated, therefore results might take considerable
more time to access.

Eventually, the SU (4) × SU (2) × U (1) models were explored. It was revealed that these models were even
more constrained than the ﬂipped SU (5) models. However, this was anticipated, due to the presence of
two SO(10) breaking basis vectors, which forbid complete generations. In actual fact, this was a rare
occurrence in the free-fermionic classiﬁcations, as the second SO(10) breaking basis vector was unique

12

and the GGSO projection on the 16 of SO(10) projected out all the right-handed particles. Thus, whole
family of generations were incomplete. The next stage will be the classiﬁcation of the standard-like and
left-right symmetric models, which are similar to the SU (4) × SU (2) × U (1) models, as they also require
two SO(10) breaking basis vectors. These GUT models are in working progress and preliminary scans
show interesting results.

In this paper, the discrete properties that emerged in the landscape of the free-fermionic heterotic-string
classiﬁcations were presented. At this point, emphasis should be put on that fact that a single JAVA
routine was used to classify the ﬂipped SU (5) models and that no 3 generation exophobic vacua were
found as in [1]. It should be noted that the classiﬁcation of the standard-like, left-right symmetric and
the remaining ﬂipped SU (5) models in the free-fermionic construction is work in progress and will be
considered extensively in future publications. To conclude, the current status of the uniﬁcation of gravity
with the gauge interactions seem to be heavily motivated by string theory that continues to provide
a viable consistent framework. Consequently, the 3 generation string models need to be obtained for
phenomenological purposes. Having said that, we are a long way away from pinning down a detailed
example. Nevertheless, string theory provides a sea of such established semi-realistic examples which are
explored as toy models in the quest for a theory of everything.
