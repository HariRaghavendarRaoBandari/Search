The dynamics of coupled condensates is a wide-encompassing problem with relevance to super-
conductors, BECs in traps, superﬂuids, etc. Here, we provide a uniﬁed picture of this fundamental
problem that includes i) detuning of the free energies, ii) diﬀerent self-interaction strengths and iii)
ﬁnite lifetime of the modes. At such, this is particularly relevant for the dynamics of polaritons,
both for their internal dynamics between their light and matter constituents, as well as for the more
conventional dynamics of two spatially separated condensates. Polaritons are short-lived, interact
only through their material fraction and are easily detuned. At such, they bring several variations
to their atomic counterpart. We show that the combination of these parameters results in important
twists to the phenomenology of the Josephson eﬀect, such as the behaviour of the relative phase
(running or oscillating) or the occurence of self-trapping. We undertake a comprehensive stability
analysis of the ﬁxed points on a normalized Bloch sphere, that allows us to provide a generalized
criterion to identify the Rabi and Josephson regimes in presence of detuning and decay.

INTRODUCTION

A superconductor can be described by an order param-
eter, that reduces in the simplest formulation the dynam-
ics of such a complex object to a simple complex num-
ber [1]. The question of what happens with the phases of
two superconductors put in contact through an insulating
barrier led Josephson to predict in 1962 with elementary
equations that a supercurrent should ﬂow between them,
driven by their phase diﬀerence [2]. The phenomenon
was quickly observed [3] and became emblematic of bro-
ken symmetries and quantum eﬀects at the macroscopic
scale. It was soon speculated that a similar phenomenol-
ogy should be observed with other macroscopically de-
generated quantum phases, such as superﬂuids or Bose–
Einstein condensates, even before the latter were experi-
mentally realized [4]. The role of the phase as the driving
agent of quantum ﬂuids was brought to the fore by An-
derson [5] who identiﬁed “phase slippage” as a source
of dissipation [6]. Notably, in the case of BECs, the
ﬁrst transposition of this physics was considering non-
interacting particles [4] and the role of the phase diﬀer-
ence as a drive for the superﬂow was the focus of atten-
tion. The question of the phase of macroscopically de-
generate quantum states remained anchored in the phe-
nomenon but also took a separate route of its own [7–9],
that is still actively investigated to this day [10, 11].

The Josephson eﬀect itself, on the other hand, was
put on its theoretical foothold by Leggett who deﬁnes it
as the dynamics of N bosons “restricted to occupy the

same two-dimensional single particle Hilbert space” [12].
Leggett introduced three regimes for such systems de-
pending on the relationship between tunelling and in-
teractions, namely the Rabi (non-interacting), Joseph-
son (weakly-interacting) and Fock (strongly-interacting)
regimes [13]. “Tunneling” refers to linear coupling be-
tween the condensates (quadratic in operators) while “in-
teractions” refer to a nonlinear self-particle quartic term.
In this sense, Josephson’s physics is a limiting case of the
Bose–Hubbard model [14], although the name retained a
strong bond with superconductors [15], possibly due to
the important applications it found as a quantum inter-
ference device [16, 17] or merely for historical reasons (the
Josephson–Bardeen debate on the existence of the eﬀect
is one highlight of scientiﬁc controversies [18]). To mark
this diﬀerence, one speaks of “Bosonic Josephson junc-
tions” (BJJ) for bosonic implementations of the Joseph-
son dynamics [19]. This typically relates to condensates
trapped in two wells, but due to its fundamental and
universal character as formulated by Leggett, numerous
platforms exhibit the eﬀect. A pioneering report came
from superﬂuids [20]. For proper BECs, a so-called “in-
ternal” Josephson eﬀect was deemed “more promising”
with alkali gases by involving diﬀerent hyperﬁne Zeeman
states rather than a straightforward coupling between
two spatially separated condensates [13]. Eventually, the
Josephson oscillation was observed in a single junction of
BEC [21]. In this text, we consider another platform that
can host Bose condensates: microcavity polaritons [22].
These systems having demonstrated Bose–Einstein con-
densation [23] and superﬂuid behaviour [24], are natu-
ral candidates to implement the Josephson physics of
coupled condensates—furthermore,
in strongly out-of-
equilibrium open systems—and several theoretical pro-

posals have been made [25–27], followed by experimen-
tal demonstrations, both in the linear (Rabi) [28] and
nonlinear (self-trapping) [29] regime. The polariton im-
plementation of Josephson eﬀects is increasingly inves-
tigated [30–38]. Recently, it was observed that polari-
tons are predisposed for Josephson physics from the very
nature of their light-matter composition [39], exhibiting
the internal type of such Josephson dynamics where the
exchange is not between two spatially separated conden-
sates but between the two internal degrees of freedom
that make up the polariton, namely, its exciton and pho-
ton components. This is an adequate picture, since con-
densates of polaritons are also condensates of photons
and excitons [40], with their Rabi coupling acting as the
tunneling. Interactions are then for the excitonic compo-
nent only, bringing a variation on the atomic counterpart
in space, and detuning of the free energies between the
modes acts as the external potential, so the analogy is
essentially complete. Bringing the framework of Joseph-
son dynamics to light-matter coupling sheds a new light
on polariton Rabi oscillations, in particular pointing out
the phase dynamics between the modes, which has been
essentially ignored in the description of such problems
when considered at the level of coupled oscillators [41–
43] rather than macroscopic wavefunctions. Since the
latter are reduced to an order parameter that does not
need in most cases vary in space (but see Refs. 44 and
45), both frameworks are tightly related, and we explore
such connections in the following. Speciﬁcally, we focus
on the general case where both detuning and diﬀerent
on-site interactions are possible, also in presence of de-
cay and pumping, as beﬁt light-matter interaction prob-
lems in dissipative quantum optics. We show how this
wider picture blurs the line between Rabi and Josephson
dynamics, or, rephrased more positively, provides an el-
egant and natural physical picture that brings the two
regimes closer together. We provide a general criterion
to take into account the new parameters and that should
be considered to claim the Josephson regime beyond the
simple observation of oscillations or of a running phase.

II. THEORY

The dynamics of the Bosonic Josephson eﬀect has been
considered extensively by Raghavan et al. [46] in a form
suitable for our discussion, including some considerations
of dissipation [47] (see Ref. 19 for a review). We now
brieﬂy introduce the main points and notations. We con-
sider the coupling between two weakly-interacting Bose
ﬁelds, a (photons) and b (excitons), with possibly diﬀer-
ent free energies a,b, ruled by the Hamiltonian:

H = H0 + V ,
H0 = aa†a + bb†b + g(a†b + b†a) ,
V = vb(b†b†bb) + va(a†a†aa) .

Of course our results and conclusions apply to other

II THEORY

systems than the internal Josephson dynamics of light-
matter coupling, as long as they are well described by
Eqs. (1), but we will keep this terminology for conve-
nience. In a Josephson workframe, a and b are ground
state annihilation operators and the averages (cid:104)a(cid:105) and (cid:104)b(cid:105)
are order parameters (c-numbers) for the two condensates
(we will note na ≡ (cid:104)a†a(cid:105) and nb ≡ (cid:104)b†b(cid:105) the populations
of each mode). The dynamics can be described in terms
of i) the population imbalance ρ ≡ ((cid:104)a†a(cid:105) − (cid:104)b†b(cid:105))/2 =
(na − nb)/2 between the two modes and ii) their rela-
tive phase σ = arg (cid:104)a†b(cid:105). Note that the relative phase is,
strictly speaking, S ≡ arg((cid:104)a(cid:105) − (cid:104)b(cid:105)) while we deﬁne it
here as σ, the argument of a ﬁrst-order cross-correlation.
This is done for greater generality as it allows us to de-
scribe all types of quantum states for coupled harmonic
oscillators, including mixed states, as will be discussed
in section V. For coherent states (describing ideal con-
densates), S = σ, and our convention thus causes no
loss of generality. Note that such mean-ﬁeld approxi-
mations that provide the pillars for the physics at play
have been relaxed in recent years and exact (numeri-
cal) solutions are now available [48, 49] that, interest-
ingly, depart considerably from the established picture,
in particular regarding the role of the phase.
In our
mean-ﬁeld approximation, where (cid:104)a†bb†b(cid:105) ≈ (cid:104)a†b(cid:105)(cid:104)b†b(cid:105)
and (cid:104)a†ba†a(cid:105) ≈ (cid:104)a†b(cid:105)(cid:104)a†a(cid:105) (this assumes that the states
remain coherent states), the two observables are ruled by
the following equations of motion [39, 46]:

∂t(ρ/N ) = F1(ρ, σ) ≡ −(cid:112)1 − 4(ρ/N )2 sin(σ) ,

where we introduce the notation F1,2 for future conve-
nience. N ≡ (cid:104)a†a(cid:105) + (cid:104)b†b(cid:105) is the total number of par-
ticles, δ = (a − b)/g is the bare modes detuning and
we highlight two particular parameters of importance to
describe the dynamics, an eﬀective detuning ∆E and an
eﬀective blueshift Λ:

∆E ≡ −δ + N (vb − va)/g ,

Λ ≡ (va + vb)N/g .

Equations (2) are the so-called BJJ equations [19] that
describe the dynamics of coupled BECs. They diﬀer in
several aspects from Superconducting Josephson Junc-
tion equations but also bear enough resemblances to lead
to similar physics. Voronova et al. [39] recently reported
a peculiar phase dynamics of BJJ when including detun-
ing, even in the linear regime: the phase oscillations are
strongly anharmonic and possibly even get in a regime of
phase-jumping (or freely running phase if unwrapped).
This is noteworthy as reminiscent of the Josephson dy-
namics, i.e., driven by interactions. Without interac-
tions, oscillations in populations remain harmonic for
all detunings, indeed with some renormalization of fre-
quencies and nonzero imbalance, as can be expected from

FIG. 1. Dynamics of the relative phase σ and population imbalance ρ in a variety of scenarios of the pure Rabi regime:

phase regime with strongly anharmonic oscillations of the phase. A zoom in inset shows that the phase is continuous. The
oscillations in the population remain sinusoidal. Parameters: ρ0 = 0.44N , σ0 = 0 and δ = −0.5. (e–f) Running-phase regime

phase (solid lines) to the running phase (dashed, not unwrapped) observed as a function of the population imbalance ρ0, from
ρ0 = 0.25N (smooth blue curve) below threshold to ρ0 = .305N (red–dashed line) above, passing by ρ0 = 0.299N (black,
kinky line) very close to threshold (from below). Other parameters are: δ = −1 and σ0 = 0. (h) Relative phase and (i)

the oscillating-phase to the running-phase regime at t1 and back at t2, with no notable feature in the population imbalance.

the conventional Rabi coupling picture out of resonance.
Particular cases of this time dynamics for ρ and σ are
shown in Fig. 1. In panel (a) and (c), σ oscillates in time,
while in panel (e), σ is running. Note how in panel (c),
close to the frontier between the two-cases, the phase
is highly deformed from harmonic oscillations. An inset
shows that the oscillation is continuous even though it
becomes very sharp. This is also seen in Fig. 1(g) for
three regimes around the transition, showing how the
phase abruptly changes from steep oscillations of π am-
plitudes (solid lines) to 2π phase jumps (dashed line).
In panel (e), we have unfolded the phase for clarity. In
all cases, particles transfer harmonically between the two
states as oscillations in ρ show. For such pure Hamilto-
nian dynamics, initial conditions as well as detuning de-
termine the possible regimes of relative phase. There fol-
lows a rich phase diagram that can be characterized an-
alytically [39] in the linear or weakly interacting regime.
Here it must be stressed again that the same phenomenol-
ogy that is usually attributed to Josephson dynamics is
observed without interactions, that is, in the pure Rabi
regime. This calls to reconsider what is meant, precisely,
by Josephson and Rabi dynamics. We clarify this point
below.

In the quantum-optical mindset, dissipation is an es-
sential part of the dynamics [42, 50]. This is also an ingre-
dient that is important to describe short-lived polaritons.

To do so, the formalism is upgraded from an Hamiltonian
to a Liouvillian description, leading to a master equation
for the density matrix : [51, 52]:

One example of the dissipative Rabi dynamics is shown
in Fig. 1(h–i). Remarkably, one observes a switching in

This switching is caused by the decay and depends on
the initial condition as well as detuning. The switching
happens if the occupation in one state becomes exactly
zero, with all the population residing in the other state,
although this is not a necessary condition. When this
occurs, the phase of the emptied state becomes ill-deﬁned
and so does the relative-phase. Such a change of regime
can appear two times, as shown in the ﬁgure, a single time
or none. In any case, the system always ends up in the
regime of oscillating phase, except at resonance where the
running mode can last forever. There is therefore only
one switching when the initial condition and detuning are
such that the dynamics starts in the running phase mode.
These are mere statements of the facts. We will explain
the reason for this peculiar behaviour in the following
and it will become clear that such an apparently rich
phenomenology is in fact trivial and bears no connection
to Rabi and Josephson dynamics.

Equations (2) and (5) are the traditional form for the
(bosonic) Josephson dynamics, coupling population im-
balance and relative phase in a way that supports the
notion that one drives the other. This form conceals,
however, the more fundamental structure that underpins
the relationship between the key variables: population
imbalance indeed, but the full complex correlator (cid:104)a†b(cid:105)
rather than merely its phase (once the connection is un-
derstood, however, one can indeed limit to the phase).
The dynamics is thus put in full view geometrically in
the (ρ,(cid:104)a†b(cid:105)) space. Since (cid:104)a†b(cid:105) is complex, the space
is three-dimensional. The trajectories can be obtained
from the full set of equations:

∂t(cid:104)a†b(cid:105) = (i(δ) + Γ+)(cid:104)a†b(cid:105) − i(cid:104)a†a(cid:105) + i(cid:104)b†b(cid:105)

where:
P(t) = − exp(2Γ+t)

−2ivb(cid:104)a†bb†b(cid:105) + 2iva(cid:104)a†ba†a(cid:105) , (7a)
∂t(cid:104)a†a(cid:105) = −i(cid:104)a†b(cid:105) + i(cid:104)b†a(cid:105) + (pa − γa)(cid:104)a†a(cid:105) + pa , (7b)
∂t(cid:104)b†b(cid:105) = i(cid:104)a†b(cid:105) − i(cid:104)b†a(cid:105) + (pb − γb)(cid:104)b†b(cid:105) + pb . (7c)
Diagonalizing these equations, we get one key result for
the dynamics:

|(cid:104)a

θ = (N (t)/2)2 + P(t) ,
(cid:90) t

exp(−2Γ+t(cid:48))(panb + pbna)dt(cid:48) .
(9)
This result holds even in the interacting case (with va (cid:54)= 0
and/or vb (cid:54)= 0), but since the Hamiltonian then needs be
diagonalized at all times, this is just a formal way to
rewrite the equation. In other cases, the geometric na-
ture of the dynamics is captured. Here, the main, albeit
obvious, argument is the introduction of the generic equa-
tion for θ, the mixing angle between exciton and photons,
describing a change of basis:

diagonalize the Hamiltonian (1b) and lead to the sim-
ple solution, Eq. (8). In the (ρ,(cid:104)a†b(cid:105)) space, the trajec-
tory is therefore simply that of “circles on a sphere”. In
non-Hamiltonian cases, the radius changes in time but
solutions remain equally simple if kept on a normalized
sphere. This sphere is a counterpart of the Bloch sphere,
that describes the dynamics of a two-level system. Here
the two levels are the exciton and photon amplitudes [40]
which yield the parametrization for the Bloch vector v:

The typical representation in a (ρ, σ) plane [19] produces
instead complex patterns, even in the linear case of sim-
ple circular motion, as a result of the transformation in-
volved by projecting from a sphere. In recent years, it has
however become more common to represent the Joseph-
son dynamics on its appropriate geometry [49, 53, 54].

III. HAMILTONIAN REGIME

A. Dynamics

We ﬁrst revisit the usual Hamiltonian case with no dis-
sipation, i.e., when pa = pb = γa = γb = 0. The pure
Rabi regime, when va and vb are zero, admits analyti-
cal solution for ρ and the phase [39]. Namely, for the
population imbalance ρ:

ρ(t) =(cid:8)δ(cid:0)2 cos(σ(0)) + ρ(0)δ) +
+ (4ρ(0) − δP (0) cos(σ(0))(cid:1) cos(Rt) +
+ RP (0) sin(σ(0)) sin(Rt)(cid:9)/R2 ,
where we introduced P ≡(cid:112)N 2 − 4ρ2 and R ≡ √

4 + δ2.
As for the relative phase σ(t) (it can also be obtained
from the real and imaginary parts of nab = (cid:104)a†b(cid:105)):

(12)

σ = − sin−1(∂tρ/P ) .

(13)

This is an exact, albeit obscure, description of the dy-
namics that is put in full view geometrically on the Bloch
sphere. Indeed, the comparison between the particular
case Eqs. (12–13) with the general solution Eq. (8) shows
the great simpliﬁcation brought by the geometric repre-
sentation. The nonlinear case has no closed-form solu-
tion to the best of our knowledge although as a two-
dimensional dynamical system, its solution are readily
obtained numerically (we provide separately an applet
to compute the trajectories in both the sphere and pro-
jected on the phase-space [55]). From Eqs. (12–13), for
instance, one can derive the conditions for oscillating or
running phase, by considering whether σ(t) is bounded
in time, in which case the function is oscillating. This
is achieved by ﬁnding zeros for its derivatives, leading to

FIG. 2. (a) The dynamics of two coupled condensates is clearly understood on a Bloch sphere. The polariton basis deﬁnes an
axis (cid:126)ρθ around which the pure Rabi dynamics evolves as a simple circle, whose distance from the center is determined by the
quantum state, with polaritons at the poles and the full-amplitude Rabi oscillations between the dressed states as the equator.
At resonance, δ = 0, (cid:126)ρ and (cid:126)ρθ are orthogonal. parameters are the same as Fig 1. (b) Projection of the dynamics of the two cases

as green dots, located at σ = 0 and σ = π. (c) The ﬁxed points are solutions of F2(ρ∗, σ∗) = 0, that is, the intersection of
the curve with the x axis, indicated by open circles. The solid line corresponds to σ = 0 and the dashed one to σ = π. The

initial conditions:

(14)

If ρ(0) is less than the rhs, then the phase is oscillating,
otherwise it is running. This perplexing result is easily
understood on the Bloch sphere, as shown in Fig. 2(a),
where the Rabi dynamics reduces to a simple circle. This
circle is concisely and fully described by its normal axis (cid:126)ρθ
and its distance ρθ from the equator in this basis. The
latter is given, on the normalized sphere, by:

(15)

This is a familiar result in quantum-optical terms.
In
the proper basis—of dressed states—the dynamics is that
of the free propagation (circular motion) of uncoupled
states. This is determined by the (cid:126)ρθ axis, around which
the dressed states evolve freely (harmonically) at a dis-
tance from the equator that is determined by their state
(their content of lower and upper polaritons), leading to a
linearly increasing phase. We can now explain that what
determines the dynamics of the phase (oscillating or run-
ning) is simply whether the trajectory on the sphere en-
circles or not the South–North ρ axis deﬁned by the labo-
ratory observables (i.e., of the bare states). In the proper
basis of dressed states, the phase is always running. Bare
states on the other hand are the familiar physical objects
of the system in which terms it is convenient to think.
In our case, they are the exciton and photon modes, and

5

are furthermore those typically observed experimentally
(only the photons in most experiments). This laboratory
basis is, in the case of optimal strong-coupling, orthog-
onal to the dressed state basis, with (cid:126)ρθ ⊥ (cid:126)ρ, and the
circular motion is observed as a sinusoidal oscillation (a
circle observed sidewise) in the general case, or even a
saw-tooth function when the quantum state maximizes
the amplitudes of oscillations by satisfying ρ/N = ±1/2
(for instance starting with all polaritons in one mode
at t = 0). This is shown in Fig. 1(a,b) and (e,f) that cor-
respond to the case of Fig. 2(a), namely, as initial condi-
tions: a 50-50 (light blue) superposition of θ-eigenstates
and another ratio (in blue), leading to a smaller circle,
both normal to the (cid:126)ρθ axis. As observed in the exciton-
photon basis, their ρ and σ dynamics is distorted. There
is no such distortion for the population imbalance, since
the circular motion from any circle on the sphere pro-
jected on any normal axis still results in a sine function.
However the relative phase is deﬁned by that of the vec-
tor that joins the center of the sphere and the circle itself.
If the circle lies outside the axis, the phase can remain
always unequivocally deﬁned in a 2π interval, leading
to oscillations as the trajectory reaches an apex on the
circle and turns back. This is the situation of the blue
circle in Fig. 2(a). In the other case where the circle goes
round the axis, there is no turning point and the phase
increases forever. This is the situation of the light blue
circle in Fig. 2(a). It is clear, then, that the dynamics
of the phase has no deep meaning of driving a ﬂow of
particles. Instead, it pertains to a choice of basis. The
oscillating phase regime corresponds to a case where the

natural for the system and the tilt between them is so

large that the phase is distorted into a qualitative dif-
ferent behaviour of oscillations instead of a linear drift.
In contrast, the running phase regime is that where the
system is described by observables close to the dressed
states of the system.

The rationale of Leggett in distinguishing between a
Rabi and Josephson regime was to set apart the cases
where tunneling g (in our case, Rabi coupling) dominates
from that where nonlinearity v dominates. At resonance
and for equal interaction on both sites, the exact crite-
rion is to compare 2vN/g to unity, (N the total number
of particles, v the self-interaction and g the tunneling
strength). This is indeed correct but, even in absence of
dissipation, is restricted to resonance and equal nonlin-
earities. Here we provide the general result to set apart
the Rabi and Josephson regimes in presence of detuning,
which is required in general since detuning may fake a
Josephson-looking dynamics even in non-interacting sys-
tems.

B. Classiﬁcation of ﬁxed points

As we are dealing with a dynamical system, the stan-
dard procedure to classify the possible trajectories is a
stability analysis around the ﬁxed points.
In the BJJ,
the ﬁxed points ρ∗ and σ∗ are by deﬁnition the solutions
Fi(ρ∗, σ∗) = 0 for i = 1, 2 (cf. Eqs. (2)). There are two
possible solutions for the phase, σ∗ = 0 and σ∗ = π (mod-
ulo 2π, so that σ∗ = −π is also a solution in a closed 2π
interval). Solving for the other variable, we exhaust the
possible ﬁxed points. Their stability is determined by the
eigenvalues λi of the Jacobian Matrix given by:

(cid:18) ∂ρF1 ∂σF1

∂ρF2 ∂σF2

(cid:19)

J =

,

(ρ∗,σ∗)

(16)

and the type can be mapped on a diagram with axes ∆ ≡
λ1λ2 and τ ≡ λ1 + λ2 [56], as shown in Fig. 3.

1. Non-interacting case

First, in the non-interacting case, the system admits

simple closed-form solutions:

As is clear on physical grounds, detuning can produce
a state with a large population imbalance, which can
bear resemblance to macroscopic quantum self-trapping
even in absence of interaction. Using the deﬁnition of
Raghavan et al. [46] that the system is macroscopically
self-trapped when its total energy balances the coupling

strength, we can ﬁnd a critical detuning that satisﬁes this
condition in absence of interactions, namely:

1 −(cid:112)1 − 4(ρ(0)/N )2 cos(σ(0))

δs =

Examples of dynamics on the Bloch sphere in this non-
interacting case are shown in Fig 2(a) and on the pro-
jected (ρ, σ) space in Fig. 2(b), with the two ﬁxed points
at σ = 0 and σ = π marked by (green) points. The
two orbits show the running and oscillatory phases sur-
rounding these ﬁxed points without being attracted nor
repelled by them. In the terminology of dynamical sys-
tems, this corresponds to ﬁxed points that are neutrally
stable. Geometrically, the ﬁxed points are the intersec-
tions with the x-axis of the curves shown in Fig. 2(c)
(zeros of F2).

4 + ∆E2 and λ2 = −i

For the stability that follows from Eq. (16), we ﬁnd
4 + ∆E2, implying that
λ1 = i
∆ > 0 and τ = 0. As a consequence, the two ﬁxed points
in the Rabi regime are centers, i.e., they are stable and
every near-enough trajectory is closed [56]. These are the
H(Λ≤Λc) points in Fig. 3 with Λ = 0.

2.

Interacting case

The general interacting case has ﬁxed points solutions

((cid:112)1 − 4(ρ∗/N )2(∆E − 2(ρ∗/N )Λ)) = 0 ,

in implicit form:
4(ρ∗/N ) + eiσ∗
(19)
also for σ∗ ∈ {0, π}. Solutions also exist in closed-form
but are too bulky to give here. The geometrical solution
is, in this case, convenient. It is shown in Fig. 4(d) for
various values of Λc. From the shape of the curve, one
can see that there are two or four ﬁxed points, and this
is the criterion one can unambiguously use to deﬁne the
Rabi and Josephson regimes, respectively. This can be
quantiﬁed by studying the order of the discriminant of
Eq. (19), yielding the Josephson regime when it is higher
than quadratic in ρ. This leads us to one important result
of this text: the generalized criterion for Josephson dy-
namics. The critical parameter that separates the Rabi
from Josephson regimes in the mean-ﬁeld approximation
is thus:

Λc =

4 + ∆E2 +

+ 3(2∆E2)1/3Ξ1/3 ,

(20)
with Ξ = 4 + ∆E2 +|4− ∆E2|. In the literature, the typ-
ical conﬁguration reduces to ∆E = 0 and yields Λc = 2.
The diagram in Fig. 5 shows the regions of Rabi (R or
blue) and Josephson (J or red) separated by the Λc fron-
tier (black solid line) according to this general criterion.
One expects the Josephson regime to occur with increas-
ing eﬀective interaction (Λ). However, this is strongly
countered by detuning, that tends to maintain the Rabi
regime with a steep increase of the threshold, that is

gion of oscillating phase for the case ρ0 = 0 and σ0 = π
(each initial condition yields its own boundary) separated
from the region of running phase by the dashed purple
line Λφ. While there is a correlation between the running
phase and the Josephson regime, one neither implies nor
is implied by the other.

Examples of orbits on the Bloch sphere in the Hamilto-
nian regime are shown in Fig. 4(a), starting with the blue
circle that corresponds to the pure Rabi regime (Λ = 0).
With increasing interactions, orbits take the shape of the
green trace, that is the frontier between the Rabi and
Josephson regimes. Increasing Λ slightly above the criti-
cal value, the saddle point appears, corresponding to the
Josephson regime. The same orbits are also shown in a
side view of the sphere, allowing to see their enclosing
or not of the (cid:126)ρ axis and, correspondingly, the running or
oscillatory-regime of the relative phase.

IV. OUT-OF-EQUILIBRIUM (LIOUVILLIAN)

REGIME

We now consider the out-of-equilibrium dynamics, here
in presence of decay only and in next Section also includ-
ing pumping.

A. Dynamics

We upgrade the Hamiltonian (H) case to include decay
by turning to a Liouvillian (L) description. Considering
only decay, this describes the dynamics of particles with
a lifetime, starting from an initial state, e.g., following a
pulsed excitation. In this regime, as already commented,
one can observe a perplexing switching between the two
regimes of relative phase, shown in Fig. 1(h–i). The rea-
son for this behaviour is readily understood on the nor-
malized Bloch sphere, where the running or oscillating
phase is a topological feature of a trajectory encircling,
or not, the axis of observables. The trajectory on this
sphere in presence of decay is shown in Fig. 6 (a). It is
helical as it drifts along the (cid:126)ρθ axis, from i) the initial
point P which distance from the center on the (cid:126)ρθ axis is
given by Eq. (15) and phase by

FIG. 3. Classiﬁcation of the ﬁxed points of the dissipative
Bosonic Josephson Junction. The axes are the functions
∆ ≡ λ1λ2 and τ ≡ λ1 + λ2 of the Jacobian’s eigenvalues,
cf. Eq. (16). Our terminology is spelled out at the bottom
of the ﬁgure, with (at most) three letters to label each case:
ﬁrst letter is either H (Hamiltonian) or L (Liouvillian) for the
cases without or with decay, respectively. Second letter is U
(uninteracting) or I (interacting) for the cases without or with
self-interactions, respectively. Third letter is R (resonance) or
D (detuned) for the cases δ = 0 or δ (cid:54)= 0, respectively. Fur-
ther criteria are speciﬁed as subscripts. For instance, LIΛ>Λc
are dissipative systems with interactions with both zero and
nonzero detuning such that Λ > Λc, in which case these sys-
tems have ﬁxed points with saddle instability. The fact that
Λ > Λc is equivalent to the existence of a saddle ﬁxed point
allows to use the latter as a necessary and suﬃcient criterion
for the Josephson regime. The Nodes area, separated from the
Spirals by τ 2−4∆ = 0, are not accesible. The purple and blue
arrows for the points LUD(|Γ−|<2) and LID(Λ≤Λc) mean that
these points belong to both the Unstable and Stable Spirals
regions. All the cases shown here are for ∆E = 0.

doubled for a detuning of one time the coupling strength
only. In highly detuned conditions, the Rabi regime pre-
dominates, even with large values of Λ.
The ﬁxed points analysis is done for each value of the
phase separately. The σ∗ = 0 solution yields eigenval-

1, 2), that imply τ = 0 and, as far as Λ ≤ Λc,
∆ > 0 meaning that the ﬁxed points remain cen-
ters (these are the H(Λ≤Λc) points with nonzero Λ
in Fig. 3). However for Λ > Λc, one ﬁxed point
falls in the region ∆ < 0 and becomes a saddle
point (H(Λ>Λc)). For σ∗ = π, the eigenvalues read

λν = ±i
1 − 4ρ∗ρ∗ (ν = 1, 2)
which, for all the values of Λ, results in ∆ > 0, meaning
that all ﬁxed points around σ∗ = π remain center points
(H(Λ≤Λc)), regardless of the strength of the interaction.
The existence of one saddle point is thus a criterion to

is not aligned with the observable (cid:126)ρ axis—which is all
the cases except at resonance—and if the initial and ﬁ-
nal points on (cid:126)ρθ are on opposite side of its zero, then
the circle will come to encircle for some time the (cid:126)ρ axis,
corresponding to the running regime of relative phase,
until it drifts again on the other side of the sphere, at
which point the system goes to the oscillatory regime.
It can happen that this spiral will pass by the north or
south pole of the (cid:126)ρ axis, which means that in the basis of
observables, one population becomes exactly zero, lead-
ing to an undeﬁned relative phase. This is not, however,

compulsory. In other cases, depending on the interplay
between decay and detuning, the trajectory remains the
whole time on one side of the sphere, in which case the
system is always in the oscillating-phase regime and there
is no switching.

There are other notable behaviours that are conve-
niently pictured on the sphere. At resonance (δ = 0)
and for dressed states (ρ0 = ±N/2), when Γ− = 0,
the relative phase starts at π/2 and is then locked at
±π/2 forever. This is a manifestation of optimal strong-
coupling with full-amplitude Rabi oscillations at the Rabi
frequency. Moreover, the population imbalance oscillates
in time around ρ = 0 while decaying toward zero. Still at
resonance, but now when Γ− (cid:54)= 0, the relative phase os-

the population imbalance decays faster as compared to
the former case. Out of resonance, δ (cid:54)= 0, when Γ− = 0
the relative phase exhibits the same trend as the Hamil-
tonian regime, however, the population decays in time.

B. Classiﬁcation of ﬁxed points

The stability analysis in the Liouvillian case shows that
the dynamics is richer and visits extended areas of the
stability diagram. This results in the family of L points in
Fig. 3 that we introduce and discuss individually below.
This new phenomenology is an important consideration
for polaritons that are inherently ﬁnite-lifetime particles.
The same stability treatment as before but now with

the system of Eqs. (5) yields for τ and ∆:

(23a)

τ = − 4Γ−ρ∗/N ,
∆ =(4/(1 − 4(ρ∗/N )2)) − Γ2−(1 − 4(ρ∗/N )2)) .
(23b)
This shows how Γ− ≡ γb−γa (as deﬁned in Eq. (6) but
here with pa = pb = 0) deﬁnes new types of ﬁxed points
in the ∆ > 0 region, namely, the system can also spiral
towards its ﬁxed points (LUD and LID(Λ≤Λc) points),
as expected from decay, instead of always orbiting them
as before (LUR and LIR(Λ≤Λc) points). An example of a
LUD trajectory, i.e., in the non-interacting (Rabi) regime
and in presence of detuning and decay, is given in Fig. 6.
From the layout of points in Fig. 3, the stability prop-
erty of the ﬁxed points in presence of decay thus remains
a good criterion to set apart the Rabi and Josephson

FIG. 6. (a) Example of the dynamics in the pure Rabi regime
(Λ = 0) in a dissipative system. The orbit is an helix on the
normalized Bloch sphere (Paria sphere), that starts from the
point P set by the initial condition and tends toward a steady
point on the ρθ axes, that remains well deﬁned thanks to the
normalization despite the steady state being the vacuum. Pa-
rameters are the same as in Fig. (1(h–i). (b) Projection of the

then drifts as the system enters in the running-phase regime,

regimes. Λc is still deﬁned according to Eq. (20), but
becomes time dependent when va (cid:54)= vb since in this
case it depends through ∆E—itself deﬁned in Eq. (3a)—
on the total population N that decays according to
N (t) ≈ N (0) exp(−(γa + γb)t/2) (the exact solution is
more complex than this overall pattern; it typically os-
cillates around this envelope due to interactions and may
exhibit complicated patterns with abrupt variations in
some particular cases, with a dynamics that would de-
serve an analysis of its own). The dependence of Λc
as function of time and the detuning in interactions,
va − vb, is shown in Fig. 7 for the case of bare mode
resonances, δ = 0, where it is seen that va = vb makes
it time-independent indeed and pinned to the textbook
value Λc = 2, while an interaction imbalance results

In the dissipative Rabi regime, that is, with decay but

no interactions, the ﬁxed points are given by:

FIG. 7. When the interactions of the two condensates are
not equal, va (cid:54)= vb, the critical Λc becomes time-dependent,
as shown here as a density plot for the case of zero detuning.
The smallest value is Λc = 2 which is the textbook value
for the Josephson regime in the case of equal interactions, at
resonance and without dissipation, as recovered here for this
particular case. Variations result in an increase of Λc, that
decays with time to tend towards this fundamental value.

Therefore, for zero detuning and |Γ−| ≤ 2, one ﬁnds the
ﬁxed points at (ρ∗ = 0, σ∗ = sin−1(Γ−/2)) and even
in the dissipative regime, these ﬁxed points remain cen-
ters (LUR|Γ−|<2). Increasing |Γ−| makes two consecutive
centers from the set of ﬁxed points approach each other
along the ρ = 0 axis until they meet when |Γ−| = 2
with the common phase σ = (2k + 1)π/2 for integer k, at
which point they become degenerate, as the LUR(|Γ−|=2)
points. For |Γ−| > 2, the ﬁxed points split again but
now along the σ axis, as they keep a common value for
the phase but depart in population imbalance accord-
(−4 + Γ2−)/4Γ2−. Past |Γ−| > 2, the
ﬁxed points also change their stability property to be-
come spiral points (LUR(|Γ−|>2)). Beside, they are now
connected by streamlines in the (ρ, σ) space, i.e., starting
close from the unstable point brings the system towards
the other point, that is stable. At non-zero detuning,
the ﬁxed points always are of the spiraling type, LUD.
Finally, it can be shown that the condition τ 2 − 4∆ < 0
separating spirals from nodal points is always satisﬁed,
so the system is at most spiraling.

Interacting case

in a dependence of Λc similar to that due to detun-
ing (cf. Fig. 5). That is, the threshold for the Joseph-
son regime is increased and decays in time down to the
value Λc of Eq. (20) at long times. The Rabi regime
is therefore always recovered since also Λ, Eq. (3b), de-
cays with time, proportionally to N . We now discuss
the various ﬁxed points in detail, starting with the non-
interacting case (va = vb = 0) and then considering in-
teractions. In both cases, however, note that with decay
only (no pumping), the steady state is the vacuum, but is
approached in a limit that is well-deﬁned and that allows
the following discussion. Even more enlighteningly, it can
be seen as a ﬁxed point on the normalized Bloch sphere,
showing again the value of this ghost object of varying
radius that uniﬁes the dynamics of relative phase and
population imbalance in a transparent way. To distin-
guish this variation of dynamically evolving sphere from
the conventional Bloch sphere, we would propose a ded-
icated terminology and refer to it as a “Paria sphere”
(after the American ghost city).

Clearly, with decay, the total number of particles de-
cays with time, and even if starting in the Josephson
regime, ultimately the system gets into the Rabi regime
where tunneling (or coupling) dominates over interac-
tions. That is, the system eventually follows the dynam-
ics of Eqs. (5), that yields the steady state of the previ-
ous Section through Eqs. (24). Such a transition between
the two regimes might in fact be the clearest evidence of
the Josephson regime in a dissipative context. This is
illustrated with the example of the dynamics in Fig. 8,
that starts from a point in the Josephson regime, i.e., a
LI(Λ>Λc) point in Fig. 3. Then Λ decays along with the
number of particles as time passes, and the helix drifts till
Λ = Λc at which point the dynamics switches to the Rabi
regime (now plotted in Blue as compared to Red in the
Josephson regime), and subsequently spirals along the ρθ
axis. Such a switching gives rise to two kinds of “popu-
lation trapping”, i.e., nonzero time-averaged population
imbalance (cid:104)ρ(cid:105). One trapping is caused by the interac-
tions, and occurs in the Josephson regime, while another

V PUMPING

cay mediates the change in the phase dynamics. In total,
we have four combinations that succeed to each others,
that illustrate well the complexity of the phenomenon
when considered in its full generality.

V. PUMPING

A. Dynamics

We now succinctly consider the dynamics of relative
phase from Eqs. 7 with nonzero pa and pb, that is, in
presence of incoherent pumping. The general case would
bring us too far astray and we therefore limit our dis-
cussion to the pure Rabi regime (non-interacting case).
We ﬁrst consider the transient, starting from the vacuum
and then brieﬂy describe the steady state situation before
giving it full attention in next section.

Starting from vacuum, the relative phase is ill-deﬁned
at t = 0. With pumping, populations in both states
increase and a relative phase is established. Note that
while S = 0 at all times since both (cid:104)a(cid:105) and (cid:104)b(cid:105) re-
main zero under incoherent pumping—that randomizes
the phase of each mode—the cross-correlator σ = (cid:104)a†b(cid:105)
is well deﬁned and gets interconnected to particles tun-
neling in a way similar to the Hamiltonian case. This
supports the idea that there is no absolute phase for
the condensate but a degree of cross-coherence, or cor-
relation, which, for the sake of convenience, we can still
refer to as a relative phase (its argument, σ is for all
purposes a relative phase). This phase sets itself at the
value ±π/2 at early times depending on the ratio pa/pb.
Figure 9(a-b) shows its subsequent evolution along with
the population imbalance. When pa/pb ≤ 1, the relative
phase starts from ≈ π/2 and then evolves oscillatory in
time towards its steady value of ≈ π. Meanwhile, the
population imbalance remains negative while its abso-
lute value increases. When pa/pb > 1, the relative phase
starts from ≈ −π/2. Also, its time evolution is diﬀer-
ent than the case pa/pb ≤ 1. As shown in Fig. 9(a-b)
for pa = 0.018g, there are oscillations around zero fol-
lowed by a jump to oscillations around π. This behavior
is connected to the population imbalance that changes
sign (from positive to negative), crossing zero. For the
oscillations in the relative phase to end up with its steady
state around 0, the population imbalance must remain
positive. At resonance (δ = 0), the relative phase re-
mains ±π/2 for any pumping ratio, and the population
imbalance shows damped oscillations around zero. This
is shown in Fig. 9(c).

Panels (d-f) of Fig. 9 shows the corresponding dy-
namics on the Bloch sphere for three pumping ratios.
The trajectory in each case starts from the point close
to the south or north pole of the observable axis, then
drifts toward a steady point near the eigenstate axis. As
can be seen in the ﬁgures, the trajectory is immediately
brought from the observable axis to the eigenstate one,
and thus has no chance to loop around or intersect the (cid:126)ρ

tem eventually switches to the Rabi regime, with the dy-

type of trapping is caused instead merely by detuning,
and occurs in the Rabi regime. Just as the distinction
between the Rabi and the Josephson regimes might be ar-
duous to make in cases where interactions, detuning and
decay compete, also the type of trapping could be am-
biguous. A decay-induced switching of regime is shown in
Fig. 8(b), with two types of trapping on both sides of the
switching. Figure 8(c) shows the behavior of the relative
phase versus time, changing from running-phase to oscil-
latory as Λ decays, up to the switching time, after which
point the phase runs again but in the Rabi regime un-
til, eventually, it is brought back to the oscillating-phase
regime (still in the Rabi regime). With this example, one
can see the diversity of the possible regimes, both for the
dynamics of the relative phase (running and oscillatory)
and for the type of the oscillations (Josephson and Rabi).
While the interaction mediates the change of regime, de-

axis. As a consequence, the relative phase only displays
damped oscillations. Consequently, the running-phase
regime is suppressed by incoherent pumping. Finally, we
have considered non-interacting systems only but also a
fairly simple model of pumping, through Lindblad op-
erators that are the direct counterpart of spontaneous
decay. Voronova et al. have reported interesting insta-
bilities akin to Kapitza’s pendulum in driven interacting
Rabi–Josephson systems with a more elaborate model of
pumping (through a reservoir) [54], hinting the complex-
ity of the more general cases.

B. Classiﬁcation of ﬁxed points

The stability analysis in presence of pumping brings
some qualitative novelties due to the randomization of
the phase. First, the ﬁxed points now lie in a four-
dimensional space instead of two before, since in the
steady state the phase acquires a deﬁnite complex value,
adding two dimensions and making obsolete the crite-
rion of running vs oscillating phase on the Paria (nor-

malized Bloch) sphere. Solving Eqs. (7) in the steady
state (with va = vb = 0), one ﬁnds:
n∗ = [pa(−4Γ+ + (Γ− − Γ+)(δ2 + Γ2
− pb(4Γ+ + (Γ− + Γ+)(δ2 + Γ2

that Eqs. (25c–25d) are more simply expressed as σ∗ =

larger, there is however a single ﬁxed point, due to the
unicity of the steady state solution. The stability of this
point follows from the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix,

values ±1 (we label them with the sign only, so that,
e.g., λ+− = Γ+ + i
X 2 + 4Γ2−δ2). The corre-
sponding eigenvectors vpq provide the directions in the
(ρ, n, σ) four-dimensional space along which the system
ﬂows when slightly perturbed. There is no obvious geo-
metrical features to characterize vpq. The stability prop-
erties are the following: if Γ+ < 0 and Y < 0, the ﬁxed
point is stable.
If only Γ+ < 0 is satisﬁed, the sub-
space spanned by {v−−, v−+, v+−} is stable while any
combination involving v++ is unstable. On the contrary,
if only Y < 0 is satisﬁed, the only stable subspace is
spanned by v++ while any other possible linear super-
position yields an unstable point. For Γ+ > 0, the dy-
namics is generally unstable, and, interestingly, can fea-
ture saddle-type of instability, that in the Hamiltonian
or dissipative regime (without pumping), was used as a
criterion for the Josephson regime, where the dynamics
is ruled by the (weak) interactions. Here the system has
no interactions, but can still manifest this type of saddle
instability and in diﬀerent ways, for instance when the
condition Γ+ > 0 and Y < 0 is met. The presence of
a saddle-type of instability in a non-interacting system
may be disconcerting, because this served in the previ-
ous cases as a robust criterion to identify the Josephson
regime, so arguably doubts may arise on what precisely
deﬁnes the Josephson regime in the most general situa-
tion. One could then look for a deeper characterization
to establish such a general criterion when also includ-
ing pumping, for instance, through the number of ﬁxed
points, or one could also upgrade the Josephson regime
to the realm of pumping non-interacting systems. How-
ever, these various approaches, although they match the
facts, lack a clear physical motivation, so we leave it an
open question whether a general deﬁnition is suitable in
the most general case that combines pumping, decay, de-
tuning and interactions. Another case worthy of interest
is Γ+ = 0 and Y = 0, that results in pure imaginary
eigenvalues. This gives rise to a center subspace, that
results in a type of bifurcation known as a “transcritical
bifurcation” [56], that is, the ﬁxed point exchanges its
stability when passing by Γ+ = 0 or Y = 0.

C. Dynamics in autocorrelations

We have clariﬁed the dynamics in real time thanks to a
normalized Bloch sphere, and articulated the fundamen-
tal links between the phase and population imbalance in
both pure Hamiltonian dynamics and in the transient dy-
namics of a driven dissipative system. In this section, we
explore possible similar relationships in a steady state sit-
uation, where the t dynamics has converged to constant
values by deﬁnition, with only dynamics in the correla-
tions remaining. The natural operators to consider are:

VI CONCLUSIONS

The former, the crossed ﬁrst order correlation func-
tion G1
ab(τ ), is related to coherence between the states
and suggests as an extension for steady states of σ, the
relative phase in autocorrelation time ϕ ≡ arg(G(1)
ab ).
The latter is related to ﬂuctuations of the population
imbalance in autocorrelation time. Correspondingly, the
question pauses itself whether these two observables are
geometrically connected or not. Using Eqs. (7) and the
quantum regression theorem, the following relationship
can be obtained:

phenomenology and, in particular, no preferred change
of basis, e.g., there is no counterpart of a regime of drift-
ing phase out of resonance and two-valued ±π/2 phase
at resonance. This is due to the Hamiltonian dynamics
being washed out by the incoherent pumping.

This shows that G(1)
ab are coupled indeed, with
a possible similar Josephson interpretation that one is
driving the other. However, their connection is through
a two-sheet hyperboloid and is thus completely diﬀerent
than the the dynamics of real-time observables, even for
the transient dynamics, where variables are connected
via a sphere of variable radius (the Paria sphere).

phase is a two-valued function, oscillating between ±π/2
(Fig. 10 (d)), which corresponds to the the oscillatory
regime of the relative phase. Correspondingly, G(1)
ab and
ab oscillate in time with a decay toward zero for G(1)

and N 2/4 for G(2)
ab . Comparing with panel (d), it is ob-
served that ϕ changes value whenever G(1)
ab becomes zero.
This shows a similar behaviour than in the real-time be-
haviour where whenever the relative phase becomes ill-
deﬁned due to one state becomings zero avoid, it changes
its regime. Here, ill-deﬁned coherence changes the value
of phase instead. Simultaneously, G(2)
reaches N 2/4,

which is the point of lowest possible ﬂuctuations. The
corresponding trajectory on the hyperboloid in panel (c)
shows a simple line (in the curved space) with Re[G(1)

0 and G(2)
ab swinging around the lowest point of the hy-
perboloid. The detuned case (δ (cid:54)= 0) is shown in Fig. 11.
This time, as seen in panel (d), the relative phase is run-
ning. Both G(1)
ab oscillate and decay toward
diﬀerent steady points as compared to resonance. The
trajectory on the hyperboloid shows this time an open
orbit, encircling the hyperboloid G(2)
ab axis without ever
touching it. In contrast to the real-time dynamics on the
Paria sphere, in autocorrelation time, there is a reduced

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have generalized and uniﬁed the
problem of Rabi and Josephson oscillations between two
weakly interacting condensates to include i) detuning,
ii) diﬀerent interactions for each condensate and iii) de-
cay. We have also overviewed the situation with pump-
ing, which, however, requires a dedicated analysis of its
own. Our results show that even at the simplest mean-
ﬁeld level, such a fundamental problem had kept some
fundamental features hidden through the particular cases
that had been focused on so far. For instance, the rela-
tive phase σ and population imbalance ρ appear in the
most general case as two sides of the same coin without
one driving the other, and their qualitative behaviour
depends on a choice of representation, with a basis that
can always be chosen in which there is a linear phase
drift in the pure Rabi regime. At such, the behaviour
of the relative phase can not be associated to neither
the Josephson nor the Rabi regime exclusively, although
it bears some degree of correlation with it, and is in-
stead a topological feature. Similar restrains apply to
self-trapping. Such relationships are elegantly captured
on a Bloch sphere of varying radius (that we termed Paria
sphere) that clariﬁes an otherwise perplexing dynamics
such as a shift of the regime of relative-phase from os-
cillating to running and oscillating again. An unambigu-
ous general criterion to identify the Rabi (Λ < Λc) and
Josephson (Λ > Λc) regimes has been provided through
the critical eﬀective interaction Λc, Eq. (20), that gener-
alizes the case found in the literature at resonance and for
equal interactions, in which case Λc = 2. In the Hamil-
tonian case, when Λ < Λc, there are two ﬁxed points
that are centers for the dynamics. When Λ > Λc, there
four ﬁxed points, the one at σ = 0 and lying between
the two other ﬁxed points being a saddle point, with all
other points being centers. Similar analyses have been
undertaken in the Liouvillian case and are summarized
in Fig. 3. Since in this case the number of particles dies
in time, the system always eventually shifts to the Rabi
regime. In the case of diﬀerent interaction strengths, also
the critical Λc becomes time dependent. Rather than the
observation of mere oscillations and/or population trap-
ping, a clear identiﬁcation of the Josephson regime in
ﬁnite-lifetime particles can instead be made by observ-
ing the transition in time from one regime to the other.
