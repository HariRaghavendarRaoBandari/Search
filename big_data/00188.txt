The Nonlinear Analytical Envelope Equation in quadratic nonlinear crystals

Morten Bache1,∗

We here derive the so-called Nonlinear Analytical Envelope Equation (NAEE) inspired by the work of Conforti et
al. [1], whose notation we follow. We present a complete model that includes χ(2) terms (see [2]), χ(3) terms (see [1]),
and then extend the model to delayed Raman eﬀects in the χ(3) term. We therefore get a complete model for ultrafast
pulse propagation in quadratic nonlinear crystals similar to the Nonlinear Wave Equation in Frequency domain [3],
but where the envelope is modelled rather than the electrical ﬁeld while still keeping a sub-carrier level resolution.
The advantage of the envelope formation is that the physical origin of the additional terms that are included to model
the physics at the carrier level becomes more clear, in contrast to the electric ﬁeld equations that are more ”black
box” expansions of the electrical ﬁeld. We also point out that by comparing our results to a very similar model and
widely used model [7], the Raman terms presented there will most likely lead to an artiﬁcially lower Raman eﬀect.

The basic forward propagation equation is

The connection to the analytical (and complex) ﬁeld E is

E(t, z) = π−1Z ∞

dωe−iωtEω(z)

so the Fourier transform of the (real) electrical ﬁeld is

Eω(z) = (Eω(z) + E ∗

ω(z))/2

which is real. The analytical envelope satisﬁes

Eω>0 = 2Eω

as well as Eω<0 = 0 and Eω=0 = Eω=0.

We will in what follows study only the case of a single pump ﬁeld, so we drop the traditional general subscripts
on all ﬁelds for the nonlinear parts. We also adopt the assumption of an isotropic nonlinear response and used scalar
notation for simplicity. The nonlinear polarization is

It is generally accepted that quadratic nonlinearities are instantaneous χ(2)(t, t1, t2) = χ(2)δ(t − t1)δ(t1 − t2), so that
P (2)
NL,t = χ(2)E2(t), meaning that in frequency domain P (2)
NL (ω) = χ(2)F {E2(t)}. For the cubic case, the standard
Born-Oppenheimer approximation implies that for optical ﬁelds one can write [4, Eq. (4.9)]

and therefore 1 − α is the fractional nonlinear response of the Raman eﬀect to the total nonlinearity χ(3)

−∞ dtg(t) = 1 (which implies that hR(t) is normalized as well),

In frequency domain this can be written as

where

(12)

(13)

(14)

We note that the Raman response does not depend on the absolute laser frequency but on the frequency oﬀset from
the laser frequency ω − ω0.

The envelope is now introduced as

A(z, t) = E(z, t)e−iβ0z+iω0t

(15)

which means we can now evaluate the nonlinear polarization response in time domain by carrying out the expansions.
Let us start with the instantaneous part

(16)

By deﬁning the analytical nonlinear polarization in the same way as for the ﬁeld, i.e. PNL,ω>0 = 2PNL,ω, we can

introduce a nonlinear polarization envelope

Using this, the instantaneous polarization envelope is

ANL(z, t) = P(z, t)e−iβ0z+iω0t

where the ’+’ subscript indicates that only the positive frequencies must be accounted for. This is also why the A∗3
term is no longer present.

A∗(z, t)e+iω0t−iβ0z[χ(3)

operates only at negative frequencies and is therefore neglected when writing the Raman polarization envelope

The Raman response one would get from a narrow-band sub-ps to ps pulse can be calculated if we keep only the
terms that are only oscillating at the carrier frequency (i.e. where the polarization envelope does not have any e±iω0t
terms) [5, equations below Eq. (8)]

(26)

Thus the fR value is somewhat smaller than the 1 − α value; the latter is in [5] reported to be 0.3 for silica, while
typically fR = 0.18 is used for silica, in good agreement with the 1 − α = 0.3 value.

With these deﬁnitions the Raman polarization envelope Eq. (20) becomes

Finally we refer to [2] for the polarization envelope in presence of a χ(2) nonlinearity. Note the equations there have
a diﬀerent deﬁnition of the exponential sign of the forward Fourier transform and the envelope, as well as a diﬀerent
deﬁnition of the nonlinear polarization. Rewriting to our deﬁnitions:

where for notational reasons we have suppressed the dependence of A on ζ and τ except in the Raman part where it is
spelled out for clarity. We have also switched to a moving reference frame ζ = z and τ = t − zβ1. This gives rise to the
NAEE phase-mismatch factor ∆kpg = β1ω0 − β0. In fact ∆kpgζ is the phase accumulated on the envelope due to the
velocity mismatch between the carrier phase velocity and the envelope group velocity. To see this we use β1 = 1/vg =
ng/c and β0 = npω0/c, where the ”phase index” np = n(ω0), to write ∆kpg = (ng − np)ω0/c = ω0(1/vg − 1/vp).

This is advantageous to model numerically because the cumbersome update of the phase mismatch in the nonlinear
step is moved to the linear dispersion operator.

R(t) = hR(t)ei2ω0t. It is important to note that this equation is reported in the stationary lab
where they deﬁne h′
frame and that the envelope ansatz is E+ = 1
+(z, t)e−iω0t], i.e. it does not include the e−iβ0z term.
Moreover, U is normalized so |U |2 gives the power. They also neglect the terms related to U U ∗2 both in the SPM
and Raman part. Despite this, we see some similarities: The SPM and THG terms seem the same, and components
of the Raman part are recognizable: both the standard term in Raman related to |U |2 and the non-standard Raman

2 [A+(z, t)eiω0t + A∗

term related to U 2 have the same forms as in our case. That being said, the factor 2
3 fR in front of the Raman terms
seems to indicate that the ”classical” limit of Eq. (25) has not been imposed, and that the value fR they report is
identical to the 1 − α value used by [5], see Eq. (22). This means that the Raman eﬀect is underestimated by a factor
of 2/3 when using classical values of the Raman eﬀect, such as the value fR = 0.18 for silica that they use, leading to
an artiﬁcial, smaller Raman eﬀect.
