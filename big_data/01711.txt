PROJECTIVE STRUCTURES AND ρ-CONNECTIONS

RADU PANTILIE

Abstract. We extend T. Y. Thomas’s approach to the projective structures, over
the complex analytic category, by involving the ρ-connections. This way, a better
control of the projective ﬂatness is obtained and, consequently, we have, for example,
the following application:
if the twistor space of a quaternionic manifold P is en-
dowed with a complex projective structure then P can be locally identiﬁed, through
quaternionic diﬀeomorphisms, with the quaternionic projective space.

This paper is dedicated to the 150th anniversary of the Romanian Academy.

Introduction

One of the problems with the Cartan connections approach to the projective struc-
tures is that there are much more ‘constant vector ﬁelds’, on the corresponding principal
bundle, than necessary to produce the geodesics. For example, the left invariant vector
ﬁelds corresponding to nilpotent elements of degree n ≥ 3 of sl(n) will, also, produce,
for example, Veronese curves, on the corresponding projective space.

Fortunately, in [14] (see [13] ; see, also, [4] for a nice review of projective structures in
the smooth setting) it is, essentially, shown that any projective structure on a smooth
manifold M corresponds to an invariant Ricci ﬂat torsion free connection on det(T M ) .
However, the extension of this approach over the complex analytic category is nontrivial
as, in this case, by [2] , the relevant bundles (for example, the tautological line bundle
over the complex projective space) can never be endowed with a connection.

Such an extension has been carried over in [9] , under the assumption that the canon-
ical line bundle admits an (n + 1)th root, where n is the dimension of the manifold
(see, also, [1] for an extension, of the T. Y. Thomas’s approach, over odd dimensional
complex manifolds).

In this paper, we work out this extension by involving the ρ-connections introduced in
[12] (see Deﬁnition 1.5 , below). The obtained main result (Theorem 2.1 ) then provides
a surprisingly simple (and improved) characterisation of projective ﬂatness (Corollary
3.1 ). From the applications, we mention, here, only the following: if the twistor space
of a quaternionic manifold P is endowed with a complex projective structure then P
can be locally identiﬁed, through quaternionic diﬀeomorphisms, with the quaternionic
projective space.

I am grateful to Ben McKay for informing me about [3] and [9] .

1. Complex projective structures and ρ-connections

In this paper, we work in the category of complex manifolds. (The corresponding

extensions over the smooth category is easy to be dealt with.)

Recall that two connections on a manifold are projectively equivalent if and only if

they have the same geodesics (up to parametrizations).

The following two results are well known. For the reader’s convenience, we sketch

their proofs.

Proposition 1.1. Let M be a manifold endowed with a connection ∇. Then there
exists a torsion free connection on M which is projectively equivalent to ∇.

Proof. This follows quickly from the following two facts. Firstly, the set of connections
on M , if nonempty, is an aﬃne space over the space of sections of End(T M ).

respect to local charts (cid:0)xi(cid:1)i on M (that is, ∇∂k ∂j = Γi

jk dxk(cid:1)i,j are the local connection forms of a connection ∇ on M , with
kj dxk(cid:1)i,j are the

jk∂i ), then (cid:0)Γi

Secondly, if (cid:0)Γi

local connection forms of a connection on M .

(cid:3)

Proposition 1.2. Let ∇ and e∇ be torsion free connections on M . Then the following
assertions are equivalent:

(i) ∇ and e∇ are projectively equivalent.
(ii) There exists a one-form α on M such that e∇XY = ∇XY + α(X)Y + α(Y )X,

for any local vector ﬁelds X and Y on M .

Proof. For this we only need the equivalence of the following facts, for a symmetric
(1, 2) tensor Γ on a vector space V :

(1) Γ(v, v) is proportional to v, for any v ∈ V .
(2) There exists α ∈ V ∗ such that Γ(u, v) = α(u)v + α(v)u , for any u, v ∈ V .

Indeed, if dim V = 1 then this is obvious, whilst, if dim V ≥ 2 and on assuming (1)

jkxjxkxi2 = Γi2

jkxjxkxi1, where (cid:0)xi(cid:1)i is

then, for any i1, i2 = 1, . . . , dim V , we have Γi1
any basis on V ∗ and xi ◦ Γ = Γi

jkxjxk.

Consequently, Γi

2(cid:0)Γi

iixi + 2Pj6=i Γi
α = 1
satisﬁes (2) , with u = v .

jk = 0 if j 6= i 6= k . Furthermore, with i ﬁxed, the one-form
ijxj(cid:1) is well deﬁned (that is, it does not depend of i ) and

(cid:3)

The following deﬁnition is, essentially, classical.

Deﬁnition 1.3. A projective covering on a manifold M is a family (cid:8)∇U(cid:9)U ∈U , where:

(a) U is an open covering of M ,
(b) ∇U is a torsion free connection on U , for any (nonempty) U ∈ U ,
(c) ∇U and ∇V are projectively equivalent on U ∩V , for any overlapping U, V ∈ U .
Two projective coverings are equivalent if their union is a projective covering. A

projective structure is an equivalence class of projective coverings.

For any manifold M , endowed with a projective structure, there exists a represen-

det(T U ) is ﬂat; such a representative will be called special. The existence of special

tative of it (cid:8)∇U(cid:9)U ∈U such that, for any U ∈ U , the connection induced by ∇U on
representatives (an essentially known fact) is proved as follows. Let (cid:8)e∇U(cid:9)U ∈U be any
representative of the projective structure. By passing to a reﬁnement of U , if neces-
sary, we may suppose that each U ∈ U is the domain of a frame ﬁeld (cid:0)u 1
U(cid:1) on
M , over U , where dim M = n . Let αU be the local connection form, with respect to
u 1
U ∧ . . . ∧ u n
n+1 αU and
∇U be given by ∇U
XY + βU (X)Y + βU (Y )X, for any U ∈ U and any local
vector ﬁelds X and Y on U . Then (cid:8)∇U(cid:9)U ∈U is as required.
Let (cid:8)∇U(cid:9)U ∈U be a representative of a projective structure on M . For any overlap-
ping U, V ∈ U , denote by αU V the one-form on U ∩ V which gives ∇V − ∇U , through
Proposition 1.2 . Then (cid:0)αU V (cid:1)(U,V )∈U ∗ is a cocycle representing, up to a nonzero fac-
tor, the obstruction [2] to the existence of a principal connection on det(T M ) , where
U ∗ = (cid:8)(U, V ) ∈ U × U | U ∩ V 6= ∅(cid:9) . Recall that this can be deﬁned as the obstruction
to the splitting of the following exact sequence of vector bundles

XY = e∇U

and ρ : E → T M is the projection induced by the diﬀerential of

Let L be a line bundle on M . Denote E = T (L∗\0)

C\{0} , and ρ : E → T M the projection.
Recall that the sheaf of sections of E is given by the sheaf of vector ﬁelds on L∗ \ 0
which are invariant under the action of C \ {0} . Therefore to any local sections s and t
of E (deﬁned over the same open set of M ) we can associate their bracket [s, t] . Then
[·, ·] is skew-symmetric, satisﬁes the Jacobi identity and ρ intertwines it and the usual
Lie bracket on local vector ﬁelds on M .

Remark 1.4. Let L be a line bundle on M and denote E = T (L∗\0)
Ln, for some n ∈ Z\{0} , then in the exact sequence 0 −→ M ×C
we just need to replace ι by (1/n) ι .

C\{0} . If we replace L by

ι−→ E

ρ

If F is a vector bundle over M we denote by Γ(F ) the corresponding sheaf of sections;

that is, Γ(U, F ) is the space of sections of F over U , for any open set U ⊆ M .

The following deﬁnition is taken from [12] .

Deﬁnition 1.5. 1) Let M be endowed with a vector bundle E, over it, and a morphism
of vector bundles ρ : E → T M .
If F is a vector bundle over M a ρ-connection on F is a linear sheaf morphism
∇ : Γ(F ) → Γ(cid:0)Hom(E, F )(cid:1) such that ∇s(f t) = ρ(s)(f ) t + f ∇st , for any local function
f on M , and any local sections s of E and t of F .

2) Suppose (for simplicity) that ρ : E → T M is the projection, with E = T (L∗\0)
C\{0}
and L a line bundle over M . Then the curvature form of a ρ-connection ∇ on F is the

4

Radu Pantilie

section R of End(F) ⊗ Λ2E∗ given by R(s1, s2) t = [∇s1, ∇s2] t − ∇[s1,s2] t , for any local
sections s1, s2 of E and t of F .

If ∇ is a ρ-connection on E then its torsion is the section T of E ⊗ Λ2E∗ given by

T (s1, s2) = ∇s1s2 − ∇s2s1 − [s1, s2] , for any local sections s1, s2 of E.

Remark 1.6. With the same notations as in Deﬁnition 1.5(2) , if L admits a (classical)
connection then any ρ-connection on F corresponds to pair formed of a C\{0} invariant
connection on π∗F , and a morphism of vector bundles from M × C to End(F ) , where
π : L \ 0 → M is the projection.

Any (classical) connection ∇ on F deﬁnes a ρ-connection e∇ given by e∇st = ∇ρ(s)t,

for any local sections s of E and t of F .

However, not all ρ-connections are obtained this way. For example, if a line bundle
over M admits a connection then its (ﬁrst) Chern class with complex coeﬃcients is
zero, and the converse also holds if M is compact K¨ahler [2] . Nevertheless, any line
bundle L is endowed with a canonical ﬂat ρ-connection ∇, where ρ : E → T M is the
projection, with E = T (L∗\0)
C\{0} . This can be deﬁned as follows. Firsly, recall that any
local section s of E over an open set U ⊆ M can be seen as a C \ {0} invariant vector
ﬁeld on L∗ \ 0 , whilst any section t of L over U corresponds to a function ft on π−1(U ) ,
where π : L∗ \ 0 → M is the projection. Then, by deﬁnition, ∇st = s(ft) .

For another example, let V be a vector space and let L be the dual of the tautological
line bundle over the projective space P V . From L∗\0 = V \{0} , it follows that T (L∗\0)
C\{0} =
L ⊗ (cid:0)P V × V ) . Thus, although P V does not admit a connection, we can associate
to it the canonical ﬂat ρ-connection given by the tensor product of the canonical ρ-
connection of L and the canonical ﬂat connection on P V × V . Note that, the canonical
ρ-connection of the projective space is torsion free.

The following fact will be used later on.

Remark 1.7. Let L be a line bundle over M and let V be a ﬁnite dimensional subspace
of the space of sections of L. Then V induces a section sV of L⊗V ∗(cid:0)= Hom(M ×V, L)(cid:1)
given by sV (x, s) = sx , for any x ∈ M and s ∈ V . Obviously, the base point set SV of
V is equal to the zero set of sV . Assume, for simplicity, that SV = ∅ .

Then the diﬀerential of the corresponding map ϕV : M → P V ∗ is induced by ∇sV :
E → L ⊗ V ∗, where E = T (L∗\0)
C\{0} and ∇ is the tensor product of the canonical ρ-
connection of L and the canonical ﬂat connection on M × V ∗. This means that, if we,
also, denote by dϕ the morphism T M → ϕ∗(cid:0)T (P V ∗)(cid:1) corresponding to the diﬀerential
of ϕ , then dϕ ◦ ρ = ρV ◦ (∇sV ) , where ρ : E → T M and ρV : L ⊗ V ∗ → ϕ∗(cid:0)T (P V ∗)(cid:1) ,
are the projections.

2. The main result on projective structures

In this section, we prove the following result (cf. [14] , [13] , [9] ).

Theorem 2.1. Let M be a manifold, dim M = n ≥ 2 , denote E = T (det(T M ))
and
let ρ : E → T M be the projection. There exists a natural correspondence between the
following:

C\{0}

(i) Projective structures on M .
(ii) Torsion free ρ-connections ∇ on E satisfying:

(ii1) ∇1s = − 1

n+1 s, for any local section s of E, where 1 is the section of E given

by x 7→ (x, 1) ∈ M × C ⊆ E ;

phism Λn+1E = Λn(T M ) , with the canonical ρ-connection of Λn(T M ) ;

(ii2) The ρ-connection induced by ∇ on Λn+1E corresponds, under the isomor-
(ii3) Ric = 0 , where Ric(s1, s2) = trace(cid:0)t 7→ R(t, s2)s1(cid:1) , for any s1, s2 ∈ E, with

R the curvature form of ∇.

Proof. Suppose that E is endowed with a torsion free ρ-connection ∇ such that, for
any local section s of E, we have ∇1s = − 1
n+1 s , as ∇ is
torsion free and [1, s] = 0 , for any local section s of E.

n+1 s . Then, also, ∇s1 = − 1

We deﬁne the geodesics of ∇ to be those immersed curves c in M for which, locally,
there exists a section s of E, over c , such that ρ ◦ s = ˙c and ∇ss = 0 (compare [11,
Remark 1.1] ). Obviously, this does not depend of the parametrization of c (as an
immersion in M ). Moreover, if t is another section of E, over c , such that ρ ◦ t = ˙c
then t = s + f 1 for some function f , on the domain of c , and, consequently, ∇tt = 0 if
and only if f = 0 ; that is, s = t .

We shall show that for any x ∈ M and any X ∈ TxM \ {0} there exists a curve c
on M and a section s of E, over c , such that ˙c(0) = X, ρ ◦ s = ˙c , and ∇ss = 0 ; in
particular, c is a geodesic (in a neighbourhood of x).
For this, let V be the typical ﬁbre of E and let (cid:0)P, M, GL(V )(cid:1) be the frame bundle
of E ; denote by π : P → M the projection. Then ∇ corresponds [12] to an equivariant
map C : P × V → T P satisfying:

(2.1)

dπ(cid:0)C(u, ξ)(cid:1) = ρ(uξ) ,
C(ua, a−1ξ) = dRa(cid:0)C(u, ξ)(cid:1) ,

for any u ∈ P , a ∈ GL(V ) and ξ ∈ V , and where Ra is the ‘(right) translation’ on P
deﬁned by a . Note that, similarly to the classical case, we have

(2.2)

∇uξs = u C(u, ξ)(fs) ,

for any local section s of E, any u ∈ P such that π(u) is in the domain of u , and any
ξ ∈ V , and where fs is the equivariant function on P corresponding to s.

For ξ ∈ V , we denote [12] by C(ξ) the vector ﬁeld on P given by u 7→ C(u, ξ) .
Now, let x ∈ M and X ∈ TxM \{0} . Choose u0 ∈ P and ξ ∈ V such that ρ(u0ξ) = X
and let c be the projection, through π , of the integral curve u of C(ξ) through u0 .

6

Radu Pantilie

Thus, if we denote s = uξ , then the ﬁrst relation of (2.1) implies ρ ◦ s = dπ( ˙u) = ˙c ; in
particular, ˙c(0) = X. Furthermore, by (2.2) , we have ∇ss = u C(u, ξ)(ξ) = 0 , where
the second ξ denotes the corresponding constant function along u .

To show that we have constructed, indeed, a projective structure, let cU : T U → E|U
be the local section of ρ corresponding to a connection on det(T U ) , for some open set
U ⊆ M (note that, we may cover M with such open sets U ). Then E|U = T U ⊕(U ×C) ,
where we have identiﬁed T U and the image of c ; in particular, ρ|U is just the projection
from E|U onto T U . Let ∇U be the (torsion free) connection on U given by ∇U
X Y =
ρ(∇X Y ) , for any local vector ﬁelds X and Y on U . Then if we intersect with U any
geodesic of ∇ we obtain a geodesic of the projective structure on U , determined by
∇U .

We have, thus, proved that any torsion free ρ-connection ∇ on E, satisfying the
n+1 s, for any local section s of E, determines a projective structure

condition ∇1s = − 1
on M .

Conversely, suppose that M is endowed with a projective structure given by the

special projective covering (cid:8)∇U(cid:9)U ∈U .

As ∇U induces a ﬂat connection on det(T U ) , it corresponds to a section cU , over
U , of ρ ; furthermore, c ◦ [X, Y ] = [c ◦ X, c ◦ Y ] for any local vector ﬁelds X and Y on
U . Therefore there exists a unique βU ∈ Γ(cid:0)E∗|U(cid:1) such that, for any t ∈ E|U , we have
t = cU(cid:0)ρ(t)(cid:1) + βU (t)1 .

Let U, V ∈ U , be such that U ∩ V 6= ∅ , and let αU V be the one-form on U ∩ V
given by Proposition 1.2 applied to ∇U |U ∩V and ∇V |U ∩V . Then, on U ∩ V , we have
cV = cU − (n + 1)αU V 1 ; equivalently, (n + 1)αU V (cid:0)ρ(t)(cid:1) = βV (t) − βU (t) , for any
t ∈ U ∩ V .

For any U ∈ U , we deﬁne a ρ-connection e∇U on E|U by
n+1 βU (t)ρ(s)(cid:1) + (cid:0)bU (s, t) + ρ(s)(cid:0)βU (t)(cid:1)(cid:1)1 ,
s t = cU(cid:0)∇U
e∇U
for any local sections s and t of E|U , where bU is some section of ⊙2E∗|U ; consequently,

ρ(s)(cid:0)ρ(t)(cid:1) − 1

n+1 βU (s)ρ(t) − 1

e∇U

s t − e∇U

t s = cU(cid:0)[ρ(s), ρ(t)](cid:1) + (cid:0)ρ(s)(cid:0)βU (t)(cid:1) − ρ(t)(cid:0)βU (s)(cid:1)(cid:1)1

= (cid:2)cU(cid:0)ρ(s)(cid:1), cU(cid:0)ρ(t)(cid:1)(cid:3) + (cid:0)ρ(s)(cid:0)βU (t)(cid:1) − ρ(t)(cid:0)βU (s)(cid:1)(cid:1)1 = [s, t] ,

that is, e∇U is torsion free.
Let U ∈ U , and denote by RicU the Ricci tensor of ∇U deﬁned by RicU (X, Y ) =
trace(cid:0)Z 7→ RU (Z, Y )X(cid:1) , for any X, Y ∈ T M , where RU is the curvature form of ∇.
For s, t ∈ E|U , we deﬁne

bU (s, t) = n+1

n−1 RicU(cid:0)ρ(s), ρ(t)(cid:1) − 1

n+1 βU (s)βU (t) .

Then a straightforward computation shows that e∇U |U ∩V = e∇V |U ∩V , for any U, V ∈ U ,
with U ∩ V 6= ∅ . We have, thus, obtained a torsion free ρ-connection ∇ on E which it
is easy to prove that it satisﬁes (ii1) .

Further, we may suppose that, for any U ∈ U , there exists an n-form ωU on U such

PROJECTIVE STRUCTURES AND ρ-CONNECTIONS

7

that ∇UωU = 0 . Consequently, ∇t(cid:0)ρ∗ωU(cid:1) = n

n+1 βU (t) ρ∗ωU , for any t ∈ E|U .

Note that, the isomorphism Λn(T ∗U ) = Λn+1(cid:0)E∗|U(cid:1) is expressed by ωU 7→ α∧ρ∗ωU ,
where α is any local section of E∗|U such that α(1) = 1 . Also, (ii1) implies that, for
any t ∈ E|U , we have ∇t(cid:0)α ∧ ρ∗ωU(cid:1) = βU (t) α ∧ ρ∗ωU .
On the other hand, the relation t = cU(cid:0)ρ(t)(cid:1) + βU (t)1 , for any t ∈ E|U , means
that βU is the ‘diﬀerence’ between the connection induced by ∇U on Λn(T U ) and
can
∇t ωU = βU (t) ωU , for any
the canonical ρ-connection
t ∈ E|U . Thus, ∇ satisﬁes (ii2) .

can
∇ on Λn(T U ) ; equivalently,

Finally, let R be the curvature form of ∇. Then a straightforward calculation shows

that, on each U ∈ U , we have

(2.3)

R = cU(cid:0)ρ∗W U(cid:1) + n+1

n−1(cid:0)ρ∗C U(cid:1) 1 ,

where W U and C U are the projective Weyl and Cotton-York tensors of ∇U , respectively,
given by

W U (X, Y )Z = RU (X, Y )Z + 1
C U (X, Y, Z) = (cid:0)∇U

X RicU(cid:1)(Y, Z) − (cid:0)∇U

Y RicU(cid:1)(X, Z) ,

n−1(cid:0)RicU (X, Z)Y − RicU (Y, Z)X(cid:1) ,

for any X, Y, Z ∈ T U . As (2.3) implies (ii3) , the proof is complete.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.2. 1) Suppose that, in Theorem 2.1 , there exists a line bundle L such
that Ln+1 = Λn(T M ) . Then we may replace det(T M ) by L∗ \ 0 , and, by Remark
1.4 , condition (ii1) becomes ∇1s = s, for any local section s of E, as satisﬁed by the
canonical ρ-connection of the projective space. Furthermore, the canonical ρ-connection
of the projective space, also, satisﬁes (ii2) and (ii3) , and the corresponding geodesics
are the projective lines (as the ‘the second fundamental form’, with respect to the
canonical ρ-connection, of any projective subspace is zero).

2) Condition (ii1) of Theorem 2.1 is necessary for ∇ to be able to deﬁne a projective
structure. Further, condition (ii2) ﬁxes the ‘horizontal’ part ρ ◦ ∇ of ∇ (among the
torsion free ρ-connections satisfying (ii1) ), whilst (ii3) ﬁxes the ‘vertical’ part βU ◦ ∇,
for U ∈ U .

3. Applications

In this section, ﬁrstly, we explain how the well known characterisation of ‘projective

ﬂatness’ can be improved by using our approach.

Corollary 3.1. Let M be endowed with a projective structure, given by the torsion
free ρ-connection ∇, and suppose that there exists a line bundle L over M such that
Ln+1 = Λn(T M ) , where dim M = n ≥ 2 .

Then ∇ is ﬂat if and only if there exists a (globally deﬁned) local diﬀeomorphism

from a covering space of M to CP n mapping the geodesics into projective lines.

8

Radu Pantilie

Proof. Assume, for simplicity, M simply-connected. Also, by Remark 2.2(1) , we may
suppose that E = T (L∗\0)
so that ∇1s = s, for any local section s of E. Then, on
C\{0}
denoting by V the typical ﬁbre of E, we have that ∇ is ﬂat if and only if L \ 0 is
a reduction to C \ {0} of the frame bundle of E, where C \ {0} ⊆ GL(V ) through
λ 7→ λ IdV . Equivalently, ∇ is ﬂat if and only if there exists an isomorphism of vector
bundles α : E → L ⊗ V , preserving the ρ-connections.
In particular, if we deﬁne
s = α(1) then s is a section of L ⊗ V which is nowhere zero; note, also, that ∇s = α .
Therefore s induces a section of P (L ⊗ V ) = M × P V given by x 7→ (cid:0)x, ϕ(x)(cid:1) , for any
x ∈ M , for some map ϕ : M → P V . Moreover, ϕ is as required, as, by Remark 1.7 ,
its diﬀerential is induced by α . The proof is complete.
(cid:3)

Recall that a rational curve on a manifold M is a nonconstant map from the pro-
jective line to M . Also, O(n) denotes the line bundle of Chern number n ∈ Z over the
projective line.

Corollary 3.2. Let M be a manifold endowed with a projective structure and a smooth
rational curve t ⊆ M with normal bundle kO(1) ⊕ (n − k − 1)O , where dim M = n ≥ 2
and k ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} .

Then t is a geodesic, k = n − 1 and the projective structure of M is ﬂat.

Proof. By using [8] , and by passing to an open neighbourhood of t , if necessary, we
may assume that M is covered with a locally complete (n + k − 1)-dimensional family
of smooth rational curves each of which has normal bundle kO(1) ⊕ (n − k − 1)O.

Denote E = T (det(T M ))

C\{0}

sequence

and let ρ : E → T M be the projection. We have an exact

0 −→ O −→ E|t

ρ|t−→ O(2) ⊕ kO(1) ⊕ (n − k − 1)O −→ 0 .

This exact sequence corresponds to k + 2 ∈ C = H 1(cid:0)t , O(−2) ⊕ kO(−1) ⊕ (n − k − 1)O(cid:1)
(the Chern number of O(k + 2) = det(T M )|t ), and, consequently, we must have E|t =
(k + 2)O(1) ⊕ (n − k − 1)O .

Let ∇ be the ρ-connection on E giving the projective structure of M . The second

fundamental form of t , with respect to ∇, is a section of

(cid:0)2O(1)(cid:1)∗ ⊗ (cid:0)2O(1)(cid:1)∗ ⊗ (cid:0)kO(1) ⊕ (n − k − 1)O(cid:1) = 4kO(−1) ⊕ 4(n − k − 1)O(−2)

and therefore it is zero. Thus, t is a geodesic and it follows that k = n − 1 (as the space
of rational geodesics has dimension 2n − 2).
Let R be the curvature form of ∇ and note that we can see it as a section of
E ⊗ N3 E∗. Then the restriction of R to any smooth rational curve, with normal
bundle (n − 1)O(1) , is a section of (n + 1)O(1) ⊗N3(cid:0)(n + 1)O(−1)(cid:1) = (n + 1)4O(−2)
and therefore it is zero. Consequently, R = 0 and the proof is complete.

(cid:3)

The ﬁrst application of Corrolaries 3.1 and 3.2 is that if the twistor space of a
quaternionic manifold P is endowed with a complex projective structure then P can

be locally identiﬁed, through quaternionic diﬀeomorphisms, with the quaternionic pro-
jective space.

Also (compare [5] ), any projective structure that admits a rational geodesic must be

ﬂat.

Finally, as any Fano manifold is compact simply-connected and admits rational
curves as in Corollary 3.2 (see [10] and the references therein) from Corrolary 3.1
we obtain the following fact [3] : the projective space is the only Fano manifold which
admits a projective structure (compare [7, (5.3)] , [6] , [10] ).
