ABSTRACT

We present a model-independent analysis of the short-timescale energy dependence of
low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the X-ray ﬂux of GRS 1915+105.
The QPO frequency in this source has previously been observed to depend on photon
energy, with the frequency increasing with energy for observations with a high ((cid:38) 2
Hz) QPO frequency, and decreasing with energy for observations with a low ((cid:46) 2 Hz)
QPO frequency. As this observed energy dependence is currently unexplained, we in-
vestigate if it is intrinsic to the QPO mechanism by tracking phase lags on (sub)second
timescales. We ﬁnd that the phase lag between two broad energy bands systematically
increases for 5 - 10 QPO cycles, after which the QPO becomes decoherent, the phase
lag resets and the pattern repeats. This shows that the band with the higher QPO
frequency is running away from the other band on short timescales, providing strong
evidence that the energy dependence of the QPO frequency is intrinsic. We also ﬁnd
that the faster the QPO decoheres, the faster the phase lag increases, suggesting that
the intrinsic frequency diﬀerence contributes to the decoherence of the QPO. We in-
terpret our results within a simple geometric QPO model, where diﬀerent radii in
the inner accretion ﬂow experience Lense-Thirring precession at diﬀerent frequencies,
causing the decoherence of the oscillation. By varying the spectral shape of the in-
ner accretion ﬂow as a function of radius, we are able to qualitatively explain the
energy-dependent behaviour of both QPO frequency and phase lag.

1 INTRODUCTION

Accreting stellar-mass black holes in binary systems regu-
larly display quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in their X-
ray ﬂux with frequencies drifting from ∼ 0.1 − 10 Hz (e.g.
Van der Klis 1989). Three main components can be identi-
ﬁed in the spectrum of these sources: disk blackbody emis-
sion, power law emission from the inner accretion ﬂow, and
a reﬂection spectrum from photons reﬂected oﬀ the disk
(Done et al. 2007). So-called ’Type-C’ low-frequency QPOs
(Casella et al. 2005) are believed to originate from the in-
ner accretion ﬂow/corona that is associated with the Comp-
tonized power-law component of the X-ray spectrum, as this
component shows a much larger variability amplitude than
the blackbody disk component (Sobolewska & Zycki 2006;
Axelsson et al. 2013). Since currently no consensus on the
origin of QPOs exists, we can generally divide QPO models
into two broad categories: geometric and intrinsic models.

In the former, the X-ray emission is constant but an oscillat-
ing accretion geometry quasi-periodically alters the observed
ﬂux. A possible origin for these geometric oscillations could
be Lense-Thirring precession of the Comptonizing medium,
due to misalignment of the black hole spin and the binary
orbit (Stella & Vietri 1997; Stella et al. 1999; Ingram et al.
2009). Alternatively, in intrinsic models the emitted lumi-
nosity itself varies, for example due to changes in mass ac-
cretion rate (Tagger & Pellat 1999; Cabanac et al. 2010) or
due to a standing shock in the accretion ﬂow (Chakrabarti &
Molteni 1993). Recently, Heil et al. (2015) and Motta et al.
(2015) conﬁrmed that the QPO amplitude depends on the
inclination of the binary orbit, strongly suggesting a geo-
metric origin (Schnittman et al. 2006). Ingram & Van der
Klis (2015) found that the iron line equivalent width changes
over a QPO cycle in GRS 1915+105, also strongly pointing
towards a geometric origin.

GRS 1915+105 is a galactic low-mass black hole binary
(BHB) located at a distance of 8.6+2.0−1.6 kpc (Reid et al. 2014),
that was discovered in 1992 by Castro-Tirado et al. (1992). It

shows a wide variety of variability properties (Belloni et al.
1997a,b), which are diﬃcult to interpret within the standard
picture of BHB accretion states (Belloni 2010, see Van Oers
et al. 2010 for a spectral comparison). Belloni et al. (2000)
report the presence of 12 accretion classes based on the prop-
erties of its lightcurve and color-color diagrams, which can
be interpreted as transition between three main states: a
hard state (C) where the disk is truncated, and two soft
states (A & B, with a low and high ﬂux respectively) where
the inner disk extends further inwards. However, all three
states show similarities to the canonical very-high state of
BHBs (Reig et al. 2003). GRS 1915+105 shows QPOs in var-
ious frequency ranges in several of its classes (Morgan et al.
1997). In this paper, we will focus on the low-frequency QPO
with frequencies between ∼ 0.5− 10 Hz, which occurs only
in the (hard) C state and is probably equivalent to Type-C
QPOs in other sources (Casella et al. 2005).

Recently, the QPO frequency has been found to change
with observed energy band in several BHBs. The energy de-
pendence of the QPO in GRS 1915+105 has been studied by
Qu et al. (2010) and Yan et al. (2012). Yan et al. (2012) anal-
ysed all RXTE observation of GRS 1915+105 up to 2010,
and found a smooth evolution of the dependence of QPO
frequency on photon energy. For observations with a low
QPO frequency (∼ 0.4 − 2.0 Hz) in the full energy band,
the QPO frequency decreases with energy, while for obser-
vations with a high QPO frequency (∼ 2.0− 8.0 Hz) in the
full energy band, the QPO frequency increases with energy.
Similarly, Li et al. (2013a) found an increase in QPO fre-
quency with energy in XTE J1550-564 for frequencies above
∼ 3.3 Hz. However, below ∼ 3.3 Hz no variations with en-
ergy were observed. Li et al. (2013b) reported comparable
behaviour in the QPO in H1743-322, also exclusively show-
ing frequency increases with photon energy. GRS 1915+105
is thus the only source to systematically show decreases of
QPO frequency with energy. As this decrease is particularly
surprising within the standard picture of accreting compact
objects, we have chosen GRS 1915+105 for our further anal-
ysis of the energy dependence.

Similarly, the QPO phase lag is known to be energy
dependent. Pahari et al. (2013), Qu et al. (2010) and Reig
et al. (2000) all found a smooth relation between this phase
lag and energy in GRS 1915+105. The same behaviour is
present in XTE J1550-564 (Wijnands et al. 1999). For GRS
1915+105, Qu et al. (2010) show that the slope of this energy
dependence changes systematically from positive for obser-
vations with low QPO frequency (i.e. hard photons lag soft
photons) to negative for observations with high frequency
(i.e. soft photons lag hard photons). Futhermore, by com-
paring multiple observations, Qu et al. (2010) and Pahari
et al. (2013) also show that the phase lag between hard and
soft photons decreases approximately log-linearly as a func-
tion of QPO frequency in the full band, switching from a
hard to soft lag around ∼ 2 Hz. This frequency of ∼ 2 Hz
is of particular interest; in observations with this QPO fre-
quency, also no energy dependence of the QPO frequency
and zero phase lag is observed. As such, this frequency sets
the border between the low and high QPO frequencies.

These recent results on the energy dependence of both
the QPO frequency and phase lags pose several challenges
for current QPO models: not all models predict an energy-
dependent QPO frequency, and none can account for the de-

crease of frequency with energy observed in GRS 1915+105
(Qu et al. 2010). Intuitively, both a higher frequency and
harder spectrum can be associated with a smaller radius in
the accretion ﬂow. Thus an increase of QPO frequency with
energy could be expected, but a decrease is counterintuitive.
Furthermore, no explanation exists for the energy and fre-
quency dependence of the phase lags. Finally, the link be-
tween all three is not fully understood. Hence, the simplest
explanation is that the QPO mechanism possesses only a
single oscillation frequency. The observed relation between
QPO frequency and energy could simply arise if the hardness
of the QPO lightcurve correlates with the QPO frequency.
In that interpretation, both the hard and soft band always
show the same frequency jitter, but the changing hardness
weights the QPO frequency diﬀerently in diﬀerent energy
bands. This would lead to observed diﬀerences in QPO fre-
quency between diﬀerent energy bands, even though there
is only a single underlying QPO frequency.

In this paper, we test this hypothesis that the observed
energy dependence of the QPO frequency arises due to
hardness-frequency correlations in the QPO lightcurve. We
have developed a novel, model-independent approach to in-
vestigate properties of the QPO, such as hardness, frequency
and phase lag, on the timescale of single QPO cycles, by re-
moving non-QPO variability from the observed lightcurves.
This allows us to test for biases causing the observed energy
dependence, as explained above, by tracking QPO frequen-
cies and hardness on short timescales. Unexpectedly, we ﬁnd
strong evidence that the observed frequency diﬀerences are
a genuine property of the underlying QPO mechanism. We
also ﬁnd that the phase lag at the QPO frequency increases
systemically on the timescale of 5− 10 QPO cycles as a re-
sult of this frequency diﬀerence, before resetting once the
QPO has become decoherent. We interpret our results in a
geometric toy model where the innermost accretion ﬂow is
subject to diﬀerential precession. By varying the shape of the
emitted X-ray spectrum as a function of radius, we are able
to qualitatively explain the observed energy dependencies of
the QPO properties.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND TIMING ANALYSIS

In this paper, we consider two plausibel origins for the en-
ergy dependence of the QPO frequency, which are depicted
schematically in Figure 1. In the left scenario, the QPO
lightcurves in the two energy bands always have the same
frequency. However, this frequency changes as a function
of time. Whenever the frequency is high, the hard band
lightcurve has a large amplitude compared to the soft band
lightcurve (where amplitude refers to the maximum devi-
ation from the mean and not the rms amplitude). When
the frequency is low, the amplitudes are reversed, i.e. the
amplitude is higher in the soft band. In this scenario, the
power spectra in the two energy bands would show a QPO
frequency weighted towards the high amplitude segments of
the lightcurve. Thus the power spectra would show a diﬀer-
ent QPO frequency, even though the frequencies are always
the same. In the alternative scenario, on the right, the QPO
lightcurves in the two energy bands simply posses a diﬀerent
frequency. While this might seem to be a simpler explanation
of the observed energy-dependence of the QPO frequency,

et al. (2010), Pahari et al. (2013) and Yan et al. (2013).
The observations are selected to evenly span a range in
QPO frequency from ∼ 0.5 to 8 Hz. Table 1 summarizes the
main properties of these observations. Using the standard
FTOOLS1 package, we extract binned mode data to pro-
duce light curves in three energy bands: a soft band from
∼ 2 to ∼ 6.7 keV, a hard band from ∼ 6.7 to ∼ 13 keV, and a
reference band covering both energy ranges. Due to changes
in the PCA gain, the exact energy bands diﬀer slightly be-
tween observations. The exact energy bands are indicated
in Table 1 for all observations. We extract all observations
using a 1/128 s time resolution, which yields a Nyquist fre-
quency of 64 Hz for the subsequent analysis.

We divide all lightcurves into 8 second segments and
for each one calculate the power density spectrum (PDS)
with a 1/8 Hz resolution. After applying the rms-squared
normalisation (Belloni & Hasinger 1990) we average the sep-
arate power spectra into one PDS per lightcurve to reduce
the standard errors. Using XSPEC v122, we ﬁt the aver-
age power spectra with a model consisting of a constant
white noise, two broad band noise (BBN) Lorentzians with
a ﬁxed centroid frequency of 0 Hz, and a Lorentzian for the
QPO fundamental and each (sub)harmonic. We ﬁt all en-
ergy bands within the same observation separately with the
same model, as linking parameters between energy bands
generally results in worse ﬁts. Details of the resulting ﬁts,
including reduced χ2 values and QPO frequencies, are listed
in Table 1. The errors shown are the one sigma conﬁdence
intervals.

In order to study the behaviour of only the QPO, and
remove broad band and Poisson noise contributions to the
variability, we apply an optimal ﬁltering technique based
on the method in Press et al. (1997). We assume that the
observed count rate c(t) consists of the true QPO signal q(t)
and an added noise component n(t):

c(t) = q(t) + n(t)

(1)

Our aim is to remove n(t) in order to estimate q(t) as accu-
rately as possible. The optimal ﬁlter provides such an esti-
mate of the true QPO signal, ˜q(t), by minimizing the squared
diﬀerence between q(t) and ˜q(t). In practice, the ﬁlter F(ν) is
applied by multiplication with the Fourier transform of the
count rate (capitalized variables indicate the Fourier trans-
form):
˜Q(ν) = F(ν)·C(ν)

(2)

The ﬁlter in Fourier space is given by

F(ν) =

|Q(ν)|2
|C(ν)|2

(3)

and thus requires an estimate of the actual QPO power spec-
trum |Q(ν)|2, for which we apply the ﬁtted QPO Lorentzian.
The remaining time series ˜q(t) estimates the true QPO
lightcurve, without other variability contributions.

The optimal ﬁlter assumes that the QPO signal q(t) and
the noise contribution n(t) are uncorrelated. In our method,
the noise consists of the white noise, the BBN and any
(sub)harmonic QPO peaks. Since the (sub)harmonics are

Figure 1. Cartoon depiction of the two considered scenarios for
the observed energy dependence of the QPO frequency. In the
scenario on the left, the frequencies in both energy bands are al-
ways the same, while in the scenario on the right, the frequencies
are diﬀerent. For clarity, the diﬀerences in frequency are exagger-
ated compared to actual observed frequency diﬀerences (listed in
Table 1).

the former scenario is more consistent with current mod-
els as there is only a single QPO frequency. Furthermore,
in the latter scenario, the diﬀerent QPO frequencies would
cause a runaway between diﬀerent energy bands over long
timescales, which is contradicted by the coherent nature of
the QPO.

There are two tests to distinguish between these two
possible explanations: ﬁrst, in the left scenario in Figure 1,
the amplitude of the QPO lightcurve should be either cor-
related with the frequency in the hard band and anticor-
related with frequency in the soft band, or vice versa. In
the right scenario, such (anti)correlations are not necessar-
ily expected. Secondly, if the QPO frequency in both energy
bands is always the same, the phase lag is expected to stay
constant. However, if both energy bands posses a diﬀerent
QPO frequency, this phase lag would systematically change
over time. As we know that the QPO is coherent on long
timescales, these changes in phase lag would occur only on
very short timescales.

We have developed a model-independent method to
search both for correlations between QPO frequency and
amplitude, and for short-timescale variations in phase lag.
The method consists of broadly four steps: we (1) extract
light curves in two broad energy bands and calculate their
power spectra, (2) ﬁlter these light curves in order to con-
serve only the QPOs, (3) determine the frequency and ampli-
tude of each QPO cycle, and (4) track the phase lag between
the energy bands on the timescale of individual QPO cycles.
Steps (1), (2) and (3) are desribed in section 2.1, while step
(4) is described in section 2.2.

clearly related to the fundamental QPO and correlations
between the BBN and the QPO are known to exist (Heil
et al. 2011), the assumption of uncorrelated noise does not
fully hold. This will especially spoil the ﬁlter at low frequen-
cies, where the BBN is dominant, and at the (sub)harmonic
frequencies. To cancel these eﬀects, we apply an extra cut
that removes all high and low frequencies outside the range
νQPO ± FWHM, where νQPO is the ﬁtted QPO frequency in
the considered energy band. As this does not remove the cor-
relations at the QPO frequency, the ﬁlter remains slightly
less then optimal. Alternative ﬁlters, that do not make as-
sumptions about noise correlations, exist: for example, the
tophat ﬁlter simply removes all power outside a certain fre-
quency range. These ﬁlters are less accurate than the opti-
mal ﬁlter and do not use any known properties of the QPO
peak. For this reason, we apply the optimal ﬁlter for the
subsequent analysis. However, our main results, presented
in the next section, do not diﬀer signiﬁcantly when using
the tophat ﬁlter.

Both the optimal and alternative ﬁlters only aﬀect
the amplitude of the power spectrum, while leaving the
phases unaltered. This implies that we can use the ﬁltered
lightcurves to measure phase lags in the subsequent analy-
sis. However, this also means that while the BBN amplitude
is removed, its phase lags are still present in the ﬁltered
lightcurve. This requires us the make the assumption that,
at νQPO, the phase lags are dominated by the QPO and the
contribution of the BBN is neglegible. We will discuss the

outside the allowed frequency range. We use 64 second seg-
ments of the light curves to produce the power spectra that
are ﬁltered, causing the diﬀerence in frequency resolution in
Figure 2. It is possible to select longer segments since the
power spectra are already ﬁtted, so there is no need to av-
erage many power spectra to reduce standard errors. Figure
3 shows the light curves corresponding to the power spec-
tra in Figure 2 in the same colors. As intended, the ﬁltered
light curve tracks the large overall oscillations, but does not
sample the added noise contributions.

In order to track each QPO cycle individually, we use
simple linear interpolation to estimate the mean-crossings
and extrema of the ﬁltered reference band light curves.
Deﬁning a QPO cycle as a light curve segment including
either three consecutive mean-crossings or two consecutive
maxima, we can determine both the maximum amplitude
and frequency of each individual cycle. This allows us to
perform the ﬁrst test of the energy-dependence of the QPO
frequency: the aforementioned presence of (anti)correlations
between amplitude and frequency.

2.2 Phase lags

The second method to test the energy-dependence of the
QPO frequency is to track the phase lag over time: if the
diﬀerent energy bands harbor a diﬀerent QPO frequency,
this phase lag should change systematically. But as was al-
ready stated, these changes should occur on short timescales
only, since the QPO is coherent on longer timescales. Hence,
we ﬁrst need to identify the timescale on which to search for
variations in phase lag.

As is visible in Figure 3, the ﬁltered lightcurves show
that the QPO amplitude repeatedly rises and falls in an
enveloping modulation. While the individual envelopes dif-
fer in length, the mean length of the envelopes in an ob-
served lightcurve is tightly correlated with the Q-factor
(νQPO/FWHM) in that lightcurve. In other words, the more
coherent the QPO, the longer the envelopes in the ﬁltered

QPO lightcurve. Hence, we name these envelopes coherent
intervals and select these as the timescales within which we
search for the changes in phase lag that might signal a gen-
uine energy dependence. We designed our subsequent anal-
ysis such that it allows us to track the phase lag throughout
these coherent intervals. As such, it consists of three inde-
pendent steps: (1) splitting each observation in segments,
(2) identifying the positions of these segments in coherent
intervals, and (3) calculating the phase lag by combining
lightcurve segments located at similar positions in their re-
spective coherent interval.

First, we divide the time-axis of each observation into
short segments of length 1/νref
is the QPO fre-
quency in the full 2− 13 keV band (hereafter referred to as
the full-band QPO frequency). Using the optimally-ﬁltered
reference band lightcurve, we search for minima in QPO am-
plitude and identify these as the start and end points of co-
herent intervals. For the second step, we label each segment
with a number based on its position inside its respective co-
herent interval, as illustrated in Figure 4: starting with zero
for the segment containing the start of the coherent interval,
we increase the label of each successive segment by one, up
until the end of the coherent interval. We deﬁne the absolute
position as the label of a segment, and the fractional position
as the ratio of the label to the total amount of segments in
the coherent interval. These positions are shown in Figure
4 as the upper and lower numbers, respectively. As we only
used the ﬁltered QPO amplitudes in this process of deﬁning
segment labels, this ﬁrst step is completely independent of
the phase or frequency properties of the QPO.

As the ﬁnal step, we ﬁlter the hard and the soft band
using their respective best ﬁtting parameters. We normalise
both lightcurves in each segment by subtracting their mean
and dividing by their standard deviation, and cross correlate
each set of simultaneous segments in the two energy bands.

function (CCF) indicates the time lag between the two en-
ergy bands in that speciﬁc segment. In order to increase the
signal-to-noise ratio in the CCFs, we average CCFs with ei-
ther the same absolute or similar relative positions. In order
to account for the uncertainty in our simple determination
of the starts of the coherent intervals, we do not consider
the zero-labeled segments in the subsequent analysis.

The time lag τ(νref

0 ) between the hard and soft band
can then be measured as the location of the peak of the av-
eraged CCF. Due to the extra cuts in the optimal ﬁlter and
the frequency diﬀerence between the two energy bands, no
analytical description of this CCF exists. Therefore, we ﬁt a
skewed Gaussian model to the central peak of the averaged
CCF. As the maximum of the skewed Gaussian model is
not represented by a single parameter, we then apply boot-
strapping to the averaging of the CCFs to determine the
one-sigma uncertainty on the time lag (see e.g. Press et al.
1997, section 15.6). Finally, we convert the time lags into
phase lags φ (νref
0 . Thus, we ob-
tain an estimate of the average phase lag between the hard
and soft band at diﬀerent absolute or fractional positions in
the coherent intervals.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Test 1: frequency-amplitude correlations

In Figure 5, we show a representative example of the rela-
tion between the amplitude and frequency of single QPO
cycles. The panels show a two-dimensional histogram of the
amplitude and frequency of individual QPO cycles, rescaled
such that the highest counts are equal to one. The left and
right panel show the relation for the soft and hard band,
respectively. Two immediate conclusions can be drawn from
the Figure: ﬁrst, both the soft and hard band show no ap-
parent (anti)correlation between frequency and amplitude.
Secondly, the panels of the energy bands appear strikingly
similar, even though the center of the distribution lies at a
diﬀerent QPO frequency. This lack of correlation and simi-
larity between the energy bands is present in all observations
analysed. Thus, this ﬁrst tests unexpectedly points towards
diﬀerent QPO frequencies in the diﬀerent energy bands, i.e.
a genuine energy dependence of the QPO frequency.

As a test of our method, we converted the observed
power spectra into maximally stochastic light curves using
the method of Timmer & Koenig (1995), i.e. the best ﬁtting
power spectra were used to generate simulated lightcurves
with the properties of Gaussian noise. After applying the
optimal ﬁltering and the tracking of QPO properties, these
simulated light curves show a completely similar relation be-
tween amplitude and frequency as the observed ones shown
in Figure 5. This similarity indicates that the triangular
shapes in the amplitude-frequency plane are simply an in-
herent property of a noise process with the observed power
spectra. The triangular shape itself is likely due to fact that
at lower amplitudes, the determination of individual QPO
cycles becomes less precise due to noise contributions.

3.2 Test 2: phase lag evolution

As a second test, we search for changes in the phase lag on
short timescales. In panel 1 of Figure 6, we show a repre-
sentative example of the evolution of the phase lag φ as
a function of fractional position within a coherent inter-
val, with φ > 0 corresponding to hard lags. The phase lag
clearly increases from no lag at the start of the coherent
intervals (fractional position of 0.0) to a signiﬁcant soft lag
at the end (fractional position of 1.0). This shows that the
hard band oscillation is systematically faster than, and hence
’runs away from’, the soft band within a coherent interval,
and thus that the two lightcurve possess a diﬀerent QPO
frequency. Furthermore, the phase lag resets at the start of
each coherent interval, causing the QPO to stay coherent on
longer timescales. This reset is already visible as the turnover
around a cycle fraction of 0.9, which is present in almost all
observations. We will discuss the presence and interpretation
of this turnover in more detail in the next section.

In order to test our method for systematic eﬀects and
biases, we repeat the analysis, but randomize the measured
start times of the coherent intervals. In other words, the as-
signed label of each segment is randomized, and does not
respresent the actual segment position. We show the result
of this check in panel 3 of Figure 6. All phase lags are consis-
tent with the grey band, which represents the average phase
lag, independently calculated by averaging all CCFs with-
out regard for their positions. This consistency indicates that
the increase in panel 1 is inherently linked to the existence
of and position within the coherent intervals.

Panels 2 and 4 show the phase lag behaviour as a func-
tion of absolute position. In order to compare phase lag be-
haviour between coherent intervals of diﬀerent lengths, we
apply an extra selection before averaging the CCFs: seg-
ments should not only have the same absolute position, but
also be located in coherent intervals of the same total length.
Interestingly, as can be seen in panel 2, shorter coherent
intervals systematically show a steeper phase lag increase,
but typically reach the same maximum lag before resetting.
This suggests an underlying relation between the origin of
the coherent intervals and the observed phase lag behaviour,
that we will discuss in section 4. Similar to panel 3, panel 4
shows the results of randomizing the assigned labels. Again,
the observed eﬀect disappears and only the average phase
lag remains.

In ﬁgure 7, we show the same relations for a lower
frequency QPO, where the frequency diﬀerence is opposite
(i.e. the QPO frequency decreases with energy). The general
trends are similar to, but, as expected, in the opposite direc-
tion as those in Figure 6. The main diﬀerence is the presence
of a non-zero phase lag at start of the coherent interval. The
similarity of the phase lag behaviour at both high and low
frequencies suggests that the runaway is a global character-
istic of the observed QPO.

As a quantiﬁcation of the increase in phase lag, we ﬁt
the phase lag as a function of fractional position with a
straight line with non-zero oﬀset:

φ (x) = αx + β

(4)

where x is the fractional position. We do not propose this
as the correct empirical representation of the lag behaviour,
but it allows us to characterize and compare all observa-

tions: the slope α quantiﬁes the total change in phase lag in
a full coherent interval and the oﬀset β estimates the starting
phase lag. In other words, the slope characterizes the run-
away between the two energy bands. Figure 8 summarizes all
observations by plotting the slope and oﬀset of this straight
line model against both full-band QPO frequency νref
0 and
QPO frequency diﬀerence between the hard and soft band,
∆ν0. The slope and oﬀset corresponding to the ﬁrst panel
in Figures 6 and 7 are shown as the red triangle and blue
square, respectively. Due to the relatively large uncertain-
ties at the fractional position of 0.95, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between ﬁtting all phase lags or disregarding the
turnover.

Figure 8 shows that the runaway eﬀect within coherent
intervals is present in all observations with a non-zero fre-
quency diﬀerence, and is small but signicant for small values
of ∆ν0. The sign of the slope, indicating which energy band
lags the other, is consistent within one sigma with the sign of
∆ν0 in all observations. Panel 2 clearly shows that the slope
increases as the frequency diﬀerence grows, as expected if the
runaway is caused by a frequency diﬀerence. Panel 3 shows
that the oﬀset, i.e. the phase lag at the start of the coherent
interval, follows a log-linear dependence on νref
0 , similar to
the behaviour of the average phase lag in Qu et al. (2010),
0 ∼ 3.5
Pahari et al. (2013) and Reig et al. (2000), up to νref
Hz. At higher frequencies, the oﬀset diverges from the log-
linear relation back to positive values. The observations with
these diverging oﬀsets correspond to the observations with
large frequency diﬀerences in panel 4. Using a completely
diﬀerent approach, Qu et al. (2010) concluded that the fre-
quency diﬀerence contributes only a small fraction to the
average phase lag at low frequency but becomes dominant
above νref

0 ∼ 3.5 Hz. In our analysis, this is visible in this

divergence of β from a log-linear dependency on frequency
above approximately the same value of 3.5 Hz.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

4.1 Robustness of the method

We have tested our method for systematic biases at several
important steps and have not found any signiﬁcant eﬀects.
The choice of energy band to determine the start times of
the coherent intervals has no eﬀect on our results: our con-
clusions hold when using either the full, hard or soft band
in this process. The same holds for the deﬁnition of a QPO
cycle used while tracking the ﬁltered lightcurves: we ﬁnd no
diﬀerence between deﬁning a QPO cycle as two consecutive
maxima or crossings of the mean photon rate. We ﬁnd slight
changes in our results if we replace the optimal ﬁlter by a
tophat ﬁlter, which simply removes all variability outside a
frequency range of νQPO ± FWHM. The phase lags do still
increase in the coherent interval, but with a shallower slope.
However, these changes can be expected since the tophat
ﬁlter is less eﬃcient than the optimal ﬁlter. This causes a
decrease in the accuracy of our ﬁltered QPO amplitude esti-
mation and thus the determination of the coherent intervals.
Finally, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant changes in our results if we ﬁt
the CCFs with other functions, such as a damped sine wave,
instead of a skewed Gaussian model. However, we apply the
skewed Gaussian model to more accurately account for the
asymmetry in the CCF when ∆ν0 is signiﬁcant.

The robustness of our method also follows from the ef-
fect of randomizing the coherent interval start times (panels
3 and 4 in Figures 6 and 7). In all observations, the phase

lag evolution disappears and only the average phase lag re-
mains. This shows that our method is capable of correctly
estimating known phase lags. It also indicates that the ob-
served phase lag evolution is inherently connected to the
coherent intervals and cannot be attributed to biases in our
method. Alternatively, if we distribute the start times evenly
over the full lightcurve, the phase lag evolution disappears
as well. This reinforces the notion that the evolution does
not simply occur in any short time scale segment, but only
in the actual coherent cycles.

In order to interpret our results as a property of the
QPO, we make the assumption that the phase lag at νQPO
is dominated by the QPO. For observations with a full-band
QPO frequency (cid:38) 5Hz, the lag spectrum shows a clear, dis-
tinct feature at the QPO frequency, while at other frequen-
cies it appears featureless and hovers around zero. This im-
plies that the phase lag is dominated by the QPO. At lower
full-band QPO frequencies, these features in the lag spec-
trum become more diluted. Hence, we apply another test
to our method: instead of calculating the CCF from opti-
mally ﬁltered lightcurves, we calculate it from lightcurves
produced using a narrow tophat ﬁlter. If this narrow tophat
ﬁlter is not centered on the QPO frequency, this method
simply searches for phase lag evolution associated with the
BBN. We perform this test several times per observation,
sliding the tophat ﬁlter from low to high frequency. We ﬁnd
that the observed phase lag evolution is only present when
applying the ﬁlter at the QPO frequency, and disappears
otherwise. This indicates that the phase lag evolution is fun-
damentally linked to the QPO mechanism, and not to the
BBN.

4.2 Phase lags

As previously shown by Qu et al. (2010), Pahari et al. (2013)
and Reig et al. (2000), the average phase lag measured for an
entire observation evolves smoothly with the QPO frequency
of that observation. We demonstrate this relation in Figure
9, where we plot average phase lag determined from the CCF
versus QPO frequency for each analysed observation. Our
results from the CCF conﬁrm the aforementioned smooth
evolution, which was previously only measured using the
cross spectrum. To quantify this evolution, we ﬁt the average
phase lags with a simple log-linear model
(cid:104)φ(cid:105) = k log(νref
(5)
which yields φ0 = 0.096± 0.001 rad and k = −0.348± 0.003
rad for νref
in Hz. These values correspond to a switch from
0
hard to soft lags at a QPO frequency of approximately 1.9
Hz. Interestingly, this is consistent with the frequency where
∆ν0 changes sign.

0 ) + φ0

It seems remarkable that the phase lags show such com-
plexity within each coherent interval, yet the average phase
lag falls on such a neat relation. An apparent discrepancy is
clearly visible in Figure 8. As long as the slope α is small
(νref
0 < 3.5 Hz), the oﬀset β follows a log-linear relation with
frequency. This is expected, since in the absence of any sig-
niﬁcant phase lag evolution, the oﬀset will simply track the
average phase diﬀerence. However, for higher QPO frequen-
cies, where ∆ν0 is large and the hard band quickly runs away
from the soft band in each coherent interval (νref
0 > 3.5 Hz,
α becomes signifcantly less than 0), the oﬀset β diverges
from the log-linear relation. This behaviour of the oﬀset al-
lows the average phase lags to remain on a log-linear re-

lation with QPO frequency, by compensating for the short
timescale phase lag evolution.

To demonstrate this compensating behaviour, we plot
the average phase lags measured from the CCF against those
measured from the phase lag evolution (Equation 4) in Fig-
ure 10. The latter are simply given by (cid:104)φ(cid:105) = (cid:104)αx + β(cid:105) =
α/2 + β . All observations clearly scatter around the dot-
ted line, which represents the diagonal. Even at the most
negative phase lags, corresponding to the highest QPO fre-
quencies and largest values of the slope α, the relation holds.
The relatively large errorbars in the y-direction are caused
by correlations between α and β in ﬁtting the phase lag
evolution, which are not large enough to explain the rela-
tion over the entire range of observations. Thus, this tight
agreement over the entire range indicates that the slope α
and oﬀset β of each observation indeed compensate such
that the average phase lag depends log-linearly on QPO fre-
quency. This shows that the phase lag evolution simply piv-
ots around the centre of each coherent interval. Of course,
this does not explain why on long timescales, fundamentally,
the average phase lag should follow a log-linear dependence
on QPO frequency.

A possible way to explain the smooth log-linear rela-
tion between the frequency and phase lag on long timescales,
could be by considering the dependence of phase lag on pho-
ton energy. Pahari et al. (2013) studied this energy depen-
dence and found that the phase lag at the QPO frequency
follows a log-linear dependence on photon energy. A simi-
lar relation is found by Qu et al. (2010), and hints of it are
present in Reig et al. (2000). The exact slope of this relation
varies between diﬀerent observations, and several observa-
tions also show hints of a break around ∼ 4− 6 keV. Next
to GRS 1915+105, Wijnands et al. (1999) showed log-linear
relations between phase lag and energy in XTE J1550-564.
The smooth relation between phase lag and QPO frequency
might be equivalent to a simple rotation of the dependence
of phase lag on energy, where the rotational angle depends
on the frequency of the QPO. This scenario is encouraged
by the presence of the same phase lag-frequency relation in
Pahari et al. (2013), Qu et al. (2010) and our results, de-
spite diﬀerences between the compared energy bands, both
in width of the bands and centroid energies. In section 4.4,
we propose a possible mechanism that can explain these two
observed dependencies of the phase lag and their possible
equivalence based on a simple toy model.

4.3 Decoherence of the QPO

As part of our analysis, we have identiﬁed the envelopes
in the QPO amplitude as so-called coherent intervals in
all observations. These successive coherent intervals can be
interpreted as subsequent, independent excitations of the
QPO mechanism with a lifetime of approximately a coher-
ence time. In this scenario, each single QPO excitation starts
with the same initial phase lag between the hard and soft
band. Subsequently, the frequency diﬀerence leads to the ob-
served phase lag evolution as the excitation decays through
the coherent interval. The observed turnover in the phase
lag evolution could arise from the emergence of the next
QPO excitation, which takes over from the previous one. In
this interpretation, the frequency diﬀerence would play a vi-
tal role in the decay of the coherence through each interval.

indicates that the latter is an adequate predictor of the average
phase lag at all QPO frequencies.

Here, we will discuss earlier evidence for separate QPO exci-
tations and the relation between QPO frequency diﬀerence
and (de)coherence. In section 4.4, we will discuss our results
in the light of a simple physical toy model.
Using adaptive decomposition in a single ∼ 4 Hz QPO
observation of XTE J1550-564, Su et al. (2015) identify in-
termittent oscillations of ∼ 3 seconds, where the QPO is
coherent. Similar to our coherent intervals, these intermit-
tent oscillations consist of high amplitude segments of the
QPO lightcurve and are separated by short, lower amplitude
segments. Su et al. (2015) interpret this behaviour within
the Lense-Thirring precession model as the alternation be-
tween steady precession (high amplitude) and unstable pre-
cession (low amplitude) of the inner hot ﬂow. The ∼ 3 sec-
ond timescale is interpreted as the the viscous timescale at
the outer radius of the inner hot ﬂow. BHB XTE J1550-564

11

A ﬁnal property of the coherent intervals is not directly
accounted for by the observed phase lag evolution: the QPO
shows coherent intervals in all observations, even when no
phase lag evolution is observed. In other words, the oscil-
lations are always quasi-periodic, regardless of the presence
of a frequency diﬀerence between energy bands. This can
be seen clearly in Figure 11, where we plot the Q-value of
the hard band as a function of relative frequency diﬀerence
∆ν0/νref
0 . In the Figure, no clear relation between ∆ν0 and Q
exists, contrary to what is expected if the frequency diﬀer-
ence and resulting phase lag evolution causes the decoher-
ence. In the next section, we oﬀer a toy model based on our
results that accounts for this last diﬃculty in explaining the
decoherence through the phase lag evolution.

4.4 A unifying model: diﬀerential precession and

spectral evolution

Any model to explain the decoherence of QPO excitations
should account for both the sign of the frequency diﬀerence
at low QPO frequencies and the link between phase lag evo-
lution, QPO frequency diﬀerence and length of the coherence
interval. The former is especially challenging: phenomeno-
logically, an increase of frequency with energy can be un-
derstood by considering diﬀerent radii in the accretion ﬂow.
If the QPO frequency can be associated with characteristic
timescales in the accretion ﬂow, a higher frequency would
correspond to a smaller radius. Simultaneously, from these
smaller radii, a harder spectrum is expected to be emitted.
In this simple picture, it is possible to account for a posi-
tive correlation between frequency and energy. However, this
simple scenario is unable to explain the anti-correlation be-
tween frequency and energy that is observed at low QPO
frequencies. This does not even touch upon the fact that the
slope of the relation between energy and QPO frequency
changes very systematically with νref
0 , which adds another
layer of diﬃculty to this problem. Since we conclude that
the frequency diﬀerence is intrinsic, any viable interpreta-
tion should relax either the assumption that a smaller radius
corresponds to shorter timescales, or to a harder emission.
Moreover, any model should also account for the observed
properties of the phase lags on long timescales, both as a
function of frequency and energy.

One possible interpretation of our results and the ob-
served sign of ∆ν0 incorporates spectral changes of the inner
accretion ﬂow as the full-band QPO frequency decreases. In
this approach, we stick to the anticorrelation between os-
cillation frequency and radius and instead loosen the view
that hardness tracks proximity to the black hole. As the
QPO amplitude is known to depend on inclination, favoring
a geometric QPO mechanism (Motta et al. 2015; Heil et al.
2015), we assume a toy model where the QPO is caused
by vertical precession of the inner ﬂow (as in e.g. Ingram
et al. 2009). In this toy model, we consider this inner ﬂow
to consist of two separate halves, which diﬀerentially precess
at slightly diﬀerent frequencies. In agreement with the ex-
pected dependence of frequency on radius, we assume that
the inner half always causes a higher QPO frequency than
the outer half: ∆ν0(Inner−Outer) > 0. Dividing the inner ﬂow
into two halves is of course an extremely simpliﬁed picture.
More realistically, the inner ﬂow might show a more contin-
uous evolution in precession frequency over radius. However,

shows energy-dependent QPO frequencies similar to GRS
1915+105 (Li et al. 2013a), suggesting that these intermit-
tent oscillations are in fact the same as coherent intervals.

Lachowicz & Done (2010) expanded the standard
Fourier methods using wavelet analysis and the Matching
Pursuit algorithm to track the QPO properties over time.
They are able to reconstruct the observed properties of the
QPO using multiple short timescale QPO signals with ran-
dom amplitudes. Given these existing results in XTE J1550-
564, the similarity between intermittent oscillations and co-
herent intervals, and the simple explanation of the short
timescale phase lag evolution, we adopt the interpretation
of coherent intervals as a manifestation of distinct, indepen-
dent excitations of the QPO mechanism.

Identifying coherent intervals as separate QPO excita-
tions does not provide an explanation for the decoherence
of the QPO through the interval. However, the systematic
phase lag evolution might be accountable for that. Interest-
ingly, we ﬁnd that the speed of the phase lag evolution is
linked to the length of the coherent interval: as is visible in
panel 2 in Figures 6 and 7, shorter coherent intervals have
a signiﬁcantly quicker phase lag evolution. Moreover, for all
coherence lengths, the phase lag reaches approximately the
same maximum value for the same QPO frequency before
turning over. Only when we account for the length of the
coherent interval, are all phase lag evolutions mapped onto
one relation (panel 1 in Figures 6 and 7). In other words: the
length of the coherent interval appears to be set at the start
of each interval and the phase lag evolves accordingly. This
suggests a causal relation between the length of a coher-
ent interval and the frequency diﬀerence in that particular
coherent interval: a larger frequency diﬀerence leads more
quickly to a large phase lag, which in turn reduces the co-
herence of the QPO and thus the length of the coherent
interval. This is consistent with the interpretation of coher-
ent intervals as independent QPO excitations, since in this
case each individual excitation can have a distinct frequency
diﬀerence. Even though the hard and soft band are not com-
pletely out of phase at the end of each coherent interval, the
phase lag could still contribute to the decoherence.

as our analysis only compares two broad energy bands, the
simpliﬁed approach is suﬃcient for a quantitative compari-
son with our results.

To qualitatively explain our results in the light of this
simpliﬁed model, we introduce an evolution of the spectral
properties of the inner and outer half of this diﬀerentially
precessing ﬂow. At high full-band QPO frequencies (> 2 Hz),
the inner half has a harder spectrum than the outer half, as
expected. As the full-band frequency decreases, the spec-
tral shapes change, such that at ∼ 2 Hz, both the inner and
outer spectrum have the same hardness. Below ∼ 2 Hz, the
spectral hardness of the inner and outer parts have switched
around so that the outer half is harder than the inner half. In
this scenario, the hard and soft band are not always accurate
tracers of the inner and outer parts of the inner ﬂow. This
causes the observed ∆ν0(hard− soft) to change from positive
to negative as frequency evolves from high to low, while the
physical frequency diﬀerence ∆ν0(Inner − Outer) stays posi-
tive, as expected. In Figure 12, we show a simpliﬁed sketch
of the model geometry and associated spectral evolution.

This diﬀerential precession model is able to explain sev-
eral of the observed features of the QPO frequency and phase
lag. A ﬁrst advantage is the fact that the diﬀerence in QPO
frequency is always intrinsically present, even when it is not
observed. Thus, the phase lag between the inner and outer
half can always evolve and decohere the precession. As each
QPO excitation ∆ν0 can change stochastically, coherent in-
tervals will vary in length. Thus, this mechanism can explain
both why the QPO is always quasi-periodic, even when no

frequency diﬀerence is observed, and why the phase lags
evolve quicker as the QPO decoheres faster. While intrin-
sically, the inner and outer half might get completely out
of phase as the QPO decoheres (φintrinsic = ±π), we observe
the spectrally weighted energy bands. Thus, the maximum
observed phase lags are actually smaller than φ = ±π, as in
our results.

Secondly, this model can explain the observed proper-
ties of the average phase lags as a function of both energy
and frequency. On average, the outer half will lag behind the
inner half with a lag of ∼ π/2, assuming that the two halves
get completely out of phase during a coherent interval. When
the inner half has a harder spectrum (high full-band QPO
frequencies), this causes an observed soft lag. However, when
the spectrum is reversed (low full-band QPO frequencies),
the observed phase lag becomes hard. Thus, this model can
explain the change from hard to soft lags as the QPO fre-
quency increases. This intrinsically constant average phase
lag will also display an energy dependence similar to the
QPO frequency, as is observed. An important argument for
our interpretation is the peculiarity that the energy depen-
dence of both the QPO frequency and phase lag ﬂip over at
∼ 2 Hz, where the lags change from hard to soft. In this
model, this frequency of ∼ 2 Hz is simply the frequency
where the spectra of the inner and outer halves have the
same shape.

This interpretation with a diﬀerentially precessing inner
ﬂow introduces a fairly complicated extra geometry, with
diﬀerent intrinsic precession frequencies. Nixon et al. (2012)
have shown that in cases with a suﬃcient misalignment be-
tween the outer disk and the black holes spin axis, Lense-
Thirring torques can break the inner ﬂow into separately
rotating rings. However, to explain the coherent intervals as
subsequent QPO excitations, these rings should set up and
decay on very short timescales. Thus, it could be envisioned
more as the introduction of a gradual warp in the inner ac-
cretion ﬂow. However, due to our limited energy resolution of
two broad energy bands, it is not possible to distinguish be-
tween a gradual warp or two independently precessing parts.
Several possible explanations for the required spectral
evolution could exist. Here, we discuss two options, although
others might be possible as well. First, the reﬂected spec-
trum could contribute: in the diﬀerential precession model,
this reﬂected spetrum is expected to be dominated by pho-
tons emitted by the outer precessing half, as this blocks
photons from the inner half. Thus, the reﬂected spectrum
will show a relatively low precession frequency. However,
the hardness of the reﬂected spectrum can change: based
on observed relations between spectral and timing proper-
ties of accreting black holes, the disk ionisation is expected
to increase with full-band QPO frequency (see e.g. Gilfanov
2010 for an overview or Shaposhnikov & Titarchuk 2009 and
Garcia et al. 2015 for speciﬁc examples). This would imply
a relatively soft reﬂected spectrum at high full-band QPO
frequencies, and a relatively hard reﬂected spectrum at low
full-band QPO frequencies. As the reﬂected spectrum shows
a slow precession, this eﬀect could possibly cause the QPO
frequency to change from increasing to decreasing as a func-
tion of energy.

A second explanation could be the presence of an ex-
tra cooling process very close to the black hole. At high
full-band QPO frequency, the diﬀerentially precessing inner

ﬂow is expected to be small. In this scenario, the cooling
process would be present in the entire ﬂow, leading to a
steepening of the spectrum everywhere. At lower full-band
QPO frequencies, the inner ﬂow extends further out - if the
extra cooling term is only present in the innermost part,
this might cause a steepening of the spectrum only for the
regions precessing most quickly. Thus, at these low frequen-
cies, this additional cooling term could cause the outer part
to be harder than the inner part. Such an extra cooling pro-
cess could for instance be pair-production and annihilation,
which, if present, would be expected close to the black hole
due to the high densities in the ﬂow (Fabian et al. 2015).

The origin of the spectral evolution as a function of full-
band QPO frequency might also account for the diﬀerences
in energy dependence of the QPO frequency between GRS
1915+105, XTE J1550-564 and H1743-322, and the lack of
observed energy dependence in other BHBs. For example, if
the reﬂected spectrum plays a signiﬁcant role, its inclination-
dependence could contribute to diﬀerences in behaviour be-
tween these sources. The role of reﬂection could be tested
by considering the energy-dependence of the QPO frequency
below ∼ 2 keV: if this role is indeed signiﬁcant, reprocessing
of photons by the disk is also expected at lower energies.
As the reprocessed photons also originate from the slower
oscillating outer half, this would cause a low observed QPO
frequency below ∼ 2 keV, similar to the QPO frequency in
our hard band. This energy range could in the future be
probed by for instance the Neutron star Interior Composi-
tion ExploreR (NICER; Gendreau et al. 2012) to search for
this eﬀect.

5 CONCLUSION

We have developed and implemented a new model-
independent method to compare QPO properties between
diﬀerent energy bands on short timescales. This has al-
lowed us to test whether the observed energy dependence
of the QPO frequency corresponds to a genuine diﬀerence
in this frequency between energy bands. We ﬁnd that no
clear (anti)correlations exist between QPO frequency and
amplitude in ﬁltered QPO lightcurves, and that the phase
lag between two energy bands increases throughout each co-
herent interval (∼ 5−10 QPO cycles), before resetting at the
end. We also ﬁnd that the speed of this phase lag evolution
is larger when the coherent interval is shorter. These results
lead us to conclude that the QPO possesses a genuinely dif-
ferent frequency in diﬀerent energy bands. We interpret this
in the context of a geometric toy model, where the QPO is
caused by diﬀerential precession of the innermost accretion
ﬂow. This toy model allows us to qualitatively explain (1)
the energy-dependence of the QPO frequency and phase lag,
(2) the smooth relation between full-band QPO frequency
and phase lag and (3) the decoherence of the QPO on the
timescale of ∼ 5− 10 QPO cycles.

Our newly developed method to track the evolution of
QPO properties on short timescales shows promise for a
more general coherent interval resolved analysis of the QPO.
For instance, next to the phase lag, it is possible to track the
QPO frequency and frequency diﬀerence and compare these
within and between coherent intervals. This would yield a
much more detailed look at the relations between the length

MNRAS 000, 1–14 (2016)

of coherent intervals, the QPO frequency diﬀerence and the
speed of the phase lag evolution. Such an analysis could shed
more light on the intricacies of the underlying QPO mech-
anism. Applying this method using narrower energy bands
could also provide a useful handle on the physical location
where the phase lag evolution and the frequency diﬀerence
originate. Finally, the method could be extended by imple-
menting the Hilbert-Huang transform (Huang et al. 1998, see
Su et al. 2015 for its application to QPO lightcurves) to ob-
tain the instantaneous frequency and amplitude in each po-
sition in the ﬁltered lightcurve. This would increase the ac-
curacy of the determination of the coherent intervals, which
would be especially useful when applying this technique to
sources with a lower X-ray ﬂux.
