Measuring the power spectral density of a stochastic process, such as a stochastic force or mag-
netic ﬁeld, is a fundamental task in many sensing applications. Quantum noise is becoming a major
limiting factor to such a task in future technology, especially in optomechanics for temperature,
stochastic gravitational wave, and decoherence measurements. Motivated by this concern, here we
prove a measurement-independent quantum limit to the accuracy of estimating the spectrum pa-
rameters of a classical stochastic process coupled to a quantum dynamical system. We demonstrate
our results by analyzing the data from a continuous optical phase estimation experiment and show-
ing that the experimental performance with homodyne detection is close to the quantum limit. We
further propose a spectral photon counting method that can attain quantum-optimal performance
for weak modulation and a coherent-state input, with an error scaling superior to that of homodyne
detection at low signal-to-noise ratios.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Recent technological advances, especially in optome-
chanics [1], suggest that quantum noise will soon be the
major limiting factor in many metrological applications
[2]. Many tasks in optomechanics force sensing, includ-
ing thermometry, estimation of stochastic gravitational-
wave background [3], and testing spontaneous wavefunc-
tion collapse [4, 5], involve the spectrum analysis of a
stochastic force, and the eﬀect of quantum noise on such
tasks has been of recent interest [4, 5]. To study the
quantitative eﬀect of experimental design on estimation
accuracy, it is important to use a rigorous statistical in-
ference framework to investigate the parameter estima-
tion error. While there exist many theoretical studies of
quantum parameter estimation for thermometry (see, for
example, Refs. [6–10]), their application to more complex
dynamical systems with broadband measurements such
as optomechanics remains unclear.

In this work, we propose a theoretical framework of
spectrum-parameter estimation with quantum dynami-
cal systems, proving fundamental limits and investigating
measurement and data analysis techniques that approach
the limits. An outstanding feature of our work is the
simple analytic results in terms of basic power spectral
densities (PSDs) in the problem, such that they can be
readily applied to optics and optomechanics experiments.
To illustrate our theory, we analyze a recent experiment

∗ mankei@nus.edu.sg

of continuous optical phase estimation and demonstrate
that the experimental performance using homodyne de-
tection is close to our quantum limit. We further pro-
pose a spectral photon counting method that can beat
homodyne detection and attain quantum-optimal perfor-
mance for weak modulation and a coherent-state input.
The advantage is especially signiﬁcant when the signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) is low, thus demonstrating the im-
portance of quantum-optimal measurements and coher-
ent optical information processing in the low-SNR regime
for gravitational-wave astronomy [11] and optical sensing
in general.

II. QUANTUM METROLOGY

A. Parameter estimation

Consider a quantum dynamical system with Hamil-
tonian ˆH[X, t] as a functional of a c-number hidden
stochastic process X(t), such as a classical force. As-
sume that the prior probability measure of X(t) depends
on a vector of unknown parameters θ. Let Y be the
quantum measurement outcome and ˇθ(Y ) be an estima-
tor of θ using Y . The central error ﬁgure of interest is
the mean-square estimation error matrix, deﬁned as

Σµν(θ) ≡ EY

(2.1)
with EY denoting the expectation over the random vari-
able Y . Our goal here is to compute analytic results

(cid:8)(cid:2)ˇθµ(Y ) − θµ

(cid:3)(cid:2)ˇθν(Y ) − θν

(cid:3)(cid:9) ,

2
where {ˆσ, PZ} is any ensemble of ˆρ with elements ˆσ
and mixing probability measure PZ such that ˆρ(θ) =
EZ|θ[ˆσ(Z|θ)].
The proof of extended convexity J ≤ J for one pa-
rameter in Ref. [24] relies on the assumption that there
exists an optimal POVM attaining j = J. Such an as-
sumption is questionable however [25], and here we use
instead the strong concavity of Uhlmann ﬁdelity [13] to
prove Eq. (2.7) for multiple parameters. Let {ˆσ, PZ} be
an ensemble for ˆρ(θ) such that

(cid:90)

ˆρ(θ) =

dzPZ(z|θ)ˆσ(z|θ).

Deﬁne the Uhlmann ﬁdelity as

F [ˆρ, ˆρ(cid:48)] ≡ tr

The strong concavity states that [13]

F [ˆρ(θ), ˆρ(θ(cid:48))] ≥

(cid:113)(cid:112)ˆρˆρ(cid:48)(cid:112)ˆρ.

(2.9)

× F [ˆσ(z|θ), ˆσ(z|θ(cid:48))].

(2.10)

concerning Σ and discover quantum measurement tech-
niques that can accurately estimate θ.

For any unbiased estimator (EY (ˆθ) = θ), the multipa-

rameter Cram´er-Rao bound states that

Σ ≥ j−1(PY ),

(2.2)

where j(PY ) is the classical Fisher information ma-
trix with respect to the observation probability measure
PY [12]. The matrix inequality means that Σ − j−1
is positive-semideﬁnite, that is, uµ(Σ − j−1)µνuν ≥ 0
for any real vector u (Einstein summation is assumed
throughout this paper). For a quantum system, let ˆρ(θ)
be a θ-dependent density operator and ˆE(y) be the pos-
itive operator-valued measure (POVM) that models the
measurement, such that

(cid:104) ˆE(y)ˆρ(θ)
(cid:105)

PY (y|θ) = tr

,

(2.3)

with tr being the operator trace. For dynamical systems,
ˆρ(θ) can be obtained using the principles of puriﬁcation
and deferred measurements [13–16]. For the purpose of
spectrum-parameter estimation, we model ˆρ as

ˆρ(θ) = EX|θ

where

To relate F to J, we use the fact [20]

F [ˆρ(θ), ˆρ(θ + u)] = 1 − 2

(2.5)

is the unitary time-ordered exponential of ˆH with total
evolution time T , |ψ(cid:105) is the initial quantum state, and the
expectation is with respect to the hidden process X(t),
the prior probability measure of which depends on θ. θ
is called hyperparameters in this context [17]. For any
POVM, a quantum Cram´er-Rao bound states that

j(PY ) ≤ J(ˆρ),

(2.6)

where J(ˆρ) is the quantum Fisher information matrix
with respect to the symmetric logarithmic derivatives of
ˆρ [18–20].

B. Extended convexity

While quantum parameter estimation bounds for dy-
namical systems have been studied previously in the con-
text of low-dimensional systems such as qubits (see, for
example, Refs. [21–23]), J is much more diﬃcult to evalu-
ate analytically for multimode high-dimensional dynami-
cal systems under continuous measurements. To proceed,
we exploit a recently discovered property of J known as
the extended convexity [24], which states that
J(ˆρ) ≤ J {ˆσ, PZ} ≡ EZ|θ [J (ˆσ)] + j(PZ),

(2.7)

where  is a scalar, u is any real vector with the same
dimension as θ, and o(2) denotes terms asymptotically
smaller than 2. It is also known that [26]

dz(cid:112)PZ(z|θ)PZ(z|θ + u) = 1 − 2

(cid:90)

uµjµν(PZ)uν

+ o(2).

(2.12)

and F [ˆσ(z|θ), ˆσ(z|θ(cid:48))]

Expanding F [ˆρ(θ), ˆρ(θ(cid:48))]
in
Eq. (2.10) using Eq. (2.11), applying Eq. (2.12) to the
right-hand side of Eq. (2.10), and comparing the 2
terms on both sides, we obtain
uµJµν(ˆρ)uν ≤ uµ

(cid:8)EZ|θ [Jµν(ˆσ)] + jµν(PZ)(cid:9) uν. (2.13)

Since this holds for any u, we obtain the matrix inequality
in Eq. (2.7). The classical simulation technique proposed
in Ref. [27] can be regarded as a special case of extended
convexity when J(ˆσ) = 0.

C. Dynamical systems

To compute simple analytic results for dynamical sys-
tems, we make further assumptions. Assume that X(t) is
zero-mean, Gaussian, and stationary, with a PSD given
by

SX (ω|θ) ≡

dτEX|θ[X(t)X(t + τ )] exp(iωτ ). (2.14)

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

For the quantum system, we assume that the Hamilto-
nian is of the form

ˆH = ˆH0 − ˆQX(t),

(2.15)

where ˆQ is the quantum generator and ˆH0 is the rest
of the Hamiltonian. For example, X(t) can be the clas-
sical force on a mechanical oscillator and ˆQ can be the
quantum position operator, as depicted in Fig. 1(a).

A modiﬁed puriﬁcation technique can transform the
problem in the interaction picture and produce an alter-
native and possibly tighter bound in terms of the optical
statistics alone [16]. For an optomechanical system, the
Hamiltonian is of the form [1]

ˆHOM = ˆHM + ˆHO + ˆh,

(2.16)

where ˆHM is the mechanical Hamiltonian, ˆHO is the opti-
cal Hamiltonian, and ˆh is the optomechanical interaction
Hamiltonian. For example, if the mechanical oscillator
with position operator ˆq interacts with one cavity opti-
cal mode with photon-number operator ˆn, ˆh = −g0 ˆnˆq,
where g0 is a coupling constant. A classical force f (t) on
the mechanical oscillator leads to a term −ˆqf (t) in ˆHM,
and if we assume ˆU to be the time-ordered exponential
of ˆHOM, f (t) can be regarded as the hidden process and
ˆq the generator.

In practice, measurements are made on the optics and
not the mechanics directly, so one is free to modify the
puriﬁcation [28] by applying any mechanical unitary to
the optomechanical one [16]. To be speciﬁc, let ˆUOM
be the time-ordered exponential of ˆHOM and ˆUM be the
time-ordered exponential of ˆHM. Since the POVM is not
applied to the mechanics, ˆU|ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ| ˆU† with ˆU = ˆU
ˆUOM
is also a valid puriﬁcation for a given force [16]. ˆU be-
comes the time-ordered exponential of the interaction-
picture Hamiltonian

†
M

ˆhM(t) ≡ ˆU

†
M(t)ˆh ˆUM(t).

ˆH(t) = ˆHO + ˆhM(t),

(2.17)
For cavity optomechanics, ˆhM(t) = −g0 ˆnˆqM(t), where
ˆqM(t) is the interaction-picture mechanical position. For
a linear mechanical system, ˆqM(t) = ˆq0(t) + X(t), where
ˆq0(t) is the operator-valued homogeneous component as a
function of the initial position and momentum operators
and X(t) is the c-number inhomogeneous component of
the displacement due to the classical force. We can hence
take X(t) to be the hidden process and ˆQ = g0 ˆn to be
the generator, obtaining uncertainty relations between
the displacement errors and the photon-number ﬂuctua-
tions, as depicted in Fig. 1(b).

In general, this interaction-picture puriﬁcation method
can be applied to any linear system with Hamiltonian of
the form ˆH0 − ˆQX(t), where ˆQ is a canonical coordinate
operator and ˆH0 is quadratic with respect to canonical
coordinates, as the eﬀect of X(t) remains a displacement
operation in any interaction picture.

Figure 1(c) and (d) depict two other examples of
Eq. (2.15) in the context of optical phase modulation, in
which case X(t) is the phase modulation on the optical
beam and ˆQ is proportional to the photon-ﬂux operator.
Other examples include the magnetometer, where X(t) is
an external magnetic ﬁeld and ˆQ is a spin operator [29],
and the voltmeter, where X(t) is an applied voltage and
ˆQ is a charge operator.

FIG. 1. (Color online). Some examples of the hidden stochas-
tic process X(t) and generator ˆQ.
(a) X(t) is the classi-
cal force and ˆQ is the mechanical position, (b) X(t) is the
c-number forced displacement and ˆQ is proportional to the
photon-number operator, (c) and (d) X(t) is the phase mod-
ulation and ˆQ is proportional to the photon-ﬂux operator.

D. Variational bound

As the extended convexity holds for any ensemble of ˆρ,
tighter bounds can be obtained by choosing the ensemble
judiciously [24]. Instead of the original ensemble given by
Eq. (2.4), we deﬁne a new stochastic process Z(t) by

restricting G to be nonzero for all frequencies of interest,
noting that the PSD of Z(t) is SX /|G|2, and making the
SPLOT assumption, Eq. (2.25) can be rewritten as

it can be

where g is an impulse-response function to be chosen
later. ˆρ can now be expressed as

(cid:110) ˆU [g ∗ Z, T ]|ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ| ˆU†[g ∗ Z, T ]
(cid:111)

ˆρ(θ) = EZ|θ

where ∗ denotes convolution. With

ˆσ = ˆU [g ∗ Z, T ]|ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ| ˆU†[g ∗ Z, T ],

(2.20)
this results in a family of ensembles {ˆσ, PZ} parameter-
ized by g for a given ˆρ.

(2.24)
We now assume that KQ(t, t(cid:48)) is independent of X(t);

tomechanics and optical-phase-modulation systems. The

This is the ﬁrst main result of this paper. Note that the
quantum state |ψ(cid:105) need not be Gaussian for the result to
hold.

For mechanical force measurements, the straightfor-
ward choice of the Hamiltonian leads to SX being the
force PSD and SQ being the mechanical position PSD.
For linear cavity optomechanics, the interaction-picture
puriﬁcation technique explained in Sec. II C leads to an
alternative Hamiltonian such that SX is the PSD of the
forced displacement and SQ is proportional to the cav-
ity photon-number PSD. For continuous optical phase
modulation [32–35], SX is the phase PSD and SQ/2 is
the photon-ﬂux PSD. In all cases, the frequency-domain
integral given by Eq. (2.32), together with the matrix
inequalities

Σ ≥ j−1 ≥ J−1 ≥ ˜J −1

(2.33)

that follow from Eqs. (2.2), (2.6), and (2.32), represent
a novel form of uncertainty relations and indicate a non-
trivial interplay between the classical noise characterized
by SX and a frequency-domain SNR given by SQSX /2
in bounding the estimation error and the Fisher informa-
tion quantities. Note also that ˜J is proportional to the
total time T , as are all the Fisher information quantities
we derive here. This means that a longer observation
time can improve the parameter estimation even if the
SNR is low, as is well known in statistics [36] but missed
by some of the previous quantum studies [4, 5].

III. CONTINUOUS OPTICAL PHASE

MODULATION

A. Error bounds

To illustrate our theory, consider the optics experiment
depicted in Fig. 1(c) or (d). An external stochastic source
X(t), such as a moving mirror or an electro-optic modu-
lator, modulates the phase of a continuous optical beam,
which is then measured to obtain information about the
source. The Hamiltonian is

ˆH =  ˆI(t)X(t),

(3.1)
where ˆI(t) is the photon-ﬂux operator, SX (ω|θ) is the
source PSD, and SI (ω) = SQ(ω)/2 is the photon-ﬂux
PSD. This model also applies to quantum optomechan-
ics if the dynamics can be linearized around a strong
optical mean ﬁeld and a suitable interaction picture is
used, as discussed in Sec. II C. The quantum limit given
by Eq. (2.32) becomes

˜Jµν = T

Equation (3.2) together with Eq. (2.33) represent an un-
certainty relation between the phase spectrum-parameter
estimation error and the photon-ﬂux PSD.

We can compare our bound with the Fisher infor-
mation for homodyne detection, a standard experimen-
tal phase measurement method [32–35], as illustrated in
Fig. 2(a). If the mean ﬁeld is strong, and the modulation
is weak or tight phase locking is achieved, the output
process can be linearized as

Y (t) ≈ X(t) + η(t),

(3.3)

Y

where η(t) is the phase-quadrature noise. The informa-
tion j(P (hom)
) can be computed analytically if η is Gaus-
sian and stationary with power spectral density Sη(ω)
such that Y is also Gaussian and stationary [31]; the re-

a extra factor of 1/(8S2

limit strictly worse than our quantum limit, especially if
SI SX is small.

B. Spectral photon counting

Although Eq. (2.33) sets rigorous lower bounds on the
estimation error Σ, there is no guarantee that the the er-
ror for any measurement can attain the ﬁnal bound ˜J−1.
Inspired by our previous work on astronomical quantum
optics [10, 38], here we analyze an alternative measure-
ment that we call spectral photon counting. Physically,
it is simply a conventional optical spectrometer with pho-
ton counting for each spectral mode [39, 40]. The ﬁrst
step of spectral photon counting is the coherent opti-
cal Fourier transform via a dispersive optical element,
such as a diﬀraction grating or a prism and a Fourier-

(a)Local OscillatorFilter(b)(c)Modulatortransform lens [39] as depicted in Fig. 2(b), or an ar-
ray of optical ring resonators with diﬀerent resonant fre-
quencies coupled to a cross grid of waveguides [41] as
depicted in Fig. 2(c). The second step is a measure-
ment of the photon numbers in the spectral modes, and
the ﬁnal step is a maximum-likelihood estimation of θ
from the spectral photon counting results. For the phase
spectrum-parameter estimation problem with weak mod-
ulation and a coherent-state input, this method turns out
) coinciding with ˜J for all
to have an information j(P (spc)
parameters.

Y

Let the positive-frequency electric ﬁeld at the input of

the phase modulator be

ˆE(+)(t) = ˆA(t) exp(−iΩt),

(3.7)

where ˆA(t) is an annihilation operator for the slowly vary-
ing envelope with commutation relation
[ ˆA(t), ˆA†(t(cid:48))] = δ(t − t(cid:48)),

(3.8)

and Ω is the optical carrier frequency. With a strong
mean ﬁeld

α ≡ (cid:104)ψ| ˆA(t)|ψ(cid:105)

(3.9)

and weak phase modulation, the output ﬁeld can be lin-
earized as

ˆB(t) ≈ ˆA(t) + iαX(t).

(3.10)

To model the optical Fourier transform, we follow
Shapiro [39] to express each frequency mode in terms
of the mode annihilation operator as

Assuming α to be time-constant,

ˆbm ≈ ˆam + iαxm,

(3.13)

(3.14)

where ˆam is the Fourier transform of ˆA(t) and xm is that
of X(t) in the same way as ˆbm.

The strong mean ﬁeld is contained in the m = 0 mode
only, and if the spectrum of xm is wide, negligible infor-
mation is lost if we neglect the m = 0 mode. The other
modes are coherent states for a given displacement iαxm
if the input beam is a coherent state [39]. For a given
xm, the photon-counting distribution for ˆnm ≡ ˆb†
ˆbm in
each mode is therefore Poissonian with mean |α|2|xm|2
and independent from one another.

Since X(t) is a hidden stochastic process, we must av-
erage the Poissonian distribution over the prior of X(t) to
obtain the ﬁnal likelihood function. For a Gaussian X(t)
with the SPLOT assumption, {xm; m > 0} are indepen-
dent complex Gaussian random variables with variances
SX (ωm|θ) [36], but since X(t) is real, the sidebands are
symmetric with xm = x∗
−m. This means that, averaged
over x, the photon numbers at opposite sideband frequen-
cies become correlated.

To simplify the analysis, suppose that, for each m > 0,
we sum the pair of measured photon numbers nm and
n−m at opposite sidebands and use a reduced set of mea-
surement record {Nm ≡ nm + n−m; m > 0} for estima-
tion. It can be shown that each Nm is also Poissonian
conditioned on the mean 2|α|2|xm|2, but now they remain
independent from one another in the set after averaging
over {xm; m > 0}.
With xm being complex Gaussian and Nm being con-
ditionally Poissonian with mean 2|α|2|xm|2, it can be
shown that the marginal distribution of Nm is a Bose-
Einstein distribution [37] with mean number

¯Nm = 2|α|2SX (ωm|θ).

where N is the average input photon ﬂux. Since SI (ω) =
N for a coherent state, Eq. (3.17) coincides with the
quantum bound in Eq. (3.2). This is the second main
result of this paper. Comparing Eq. (3.17) with the ho-
modyne limit given by Eq. (3.6), we can expect that spec-
tral photon counting becomes signiﬁcantly better than
homodyne detection when N SX is small.

C. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck spectrum analysis

For a more speciﬁc example, consider the experiments
in Refs. [33, 34], which can be modeled as the continuous-
optical-phase-modulation problem depicted in Fig. 1(d),
with adaptive homodyne detection depicted in Fig. 2(a)
and X(t) given by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The
PSD of X(t) is

SX (ω|θ) =

(3.18)

where θ1 = EX|θ[X 2(t)] is the area under SX and θ2 is the
bandwidth. The experimental SI can be assumed to be
constant for all frequencies of interest, and the quantum
limit given by Eq. (3.2) on the estimation of θ1 and θ2
can be computed analytically:

For homodyne detection, C is an upper limit on the ratio

and the homodyne performance
is near-quantum-
optimal. This asymptotic behavior is diﬀerent from that
of the bounds for single-parameter estimation, as both
1/ ˜Jµµ and 1/˜jµµ scale as C−1/2 and decrease indeﬁnitely
for increasing C. The matrix bounds thus demonstrate
the detrimental eﬀect of having two unknown parameters
that act as noise to each other. The C-independent lim-
its also suggest that, once an experiment is in the high-
SNR regime, no signiﬁcant improvement can be made by
increasing SI and reducing the noise ﬂoor via photon-
ﬂux increase, squeezing, or changing the measurement
method.

where the homodyne bounds on Σ11 and Σ22 diverge

from the quantum bounds by a large factor of 2/C (cid:29) 1.
The diverging bounds demonstrate the importance of
quantum-optimal measurement in the low-SNR limit: at
least for a coherent-state input and weak modulation, the
quantum-optimal performance of spectral photon count-
ing can exhibit a superior error scaling and oﬀer signiﬁ-
cant improvements over homodyne detection.

D. Experimental data analysis

To compare our theory with actual experimental per-
formance, we analyze the data from the experiment
reported in Ref. [33], which is in a high-SNR regime
(C ≥ 23.5) and the adaptive homodyne performance is
expected to be close to our quantum limit. We focus
on the experiment with coherent states and not the one
with squeezed states reported in Ref. [34], as Eqs. (3.22)
imply that squeezing oﬀers insigniﬁcant improvement in
this high-SNR regime.
The experiment reported in Ref. [33] used four diﬀerent
mean photon ﬂuxes N1 = 1.315 × 106 s−1, N2 = 3.616 ×
106 s−1, N3 = 6.327× 106 s−1, N4 = 1.418× 107 s−1. For
each photon ﬂux Nk, Mk traces of X(t) and Mk traces of
Y (t) were recorded (M1 = 21, M2 = 23, M3 = 24, M4 =
27). Each trace of Y (t) was obtained using a diﬀerent
feedback gain for the ﬁlter in the phase-locked loop, such
that the phase locking might not be optimal. The original
purpose of varying the feedback gains was to demonstrate
the existence of an optimal ﬁlter for phase estimation
in Ref. [33], but it is also coincidentally appropriate in
our present context, as θ1 and θ2 are supposed to be
unknown here and the optimal ﬁlter is not supposed to be
known. To make the data analysis tractable, we assume
that the phase locking remained tight even if the ﬁlter
was suboptimal, such that we can still use the linearized
model
Y (t) = sin[X(t) − ˇX(t)] + η(t) + ˇX(t) ≈ X(t) + η(t),
(3.25)

where ˇX(t) is the feedback phase modulation on the lo-
cal oscillator. Comparisons of the experimental X(t)
with ˇX(t) show that E[X(t) − ˇX(t)]2 <∼ 0.3 and the lin-

earized model is reasonable. Most metrological experi-
ments, such as gravitational-wave detectors, deal with ex-
tremely weak phase modulation, so the linearized model
is expected to be even more accurate in those cases. Ap-
pendix A describes further calibrations to ensure that
Eq. (3.25) is accurate.

For any observation time T , the maximum-likelihood
estimation can be performed using an expectation-
maximization algorithm [36, 42], but our numerical sim-
ulations suggest that it is safe here to use a simpler and
faster method due to Whittle [43], which exploits the
SPLOT assumption to simplify the likelihood function.
Consider a real discrete-time series
{Y (tl); l = 0, 1, . . . , L − 1} ,

tl = lδt,

(3.26)

and zero-mean Gaussian statistics conditioned on θ. De-
ﬁne the discrete Fourier transform as

ym =

δt√
T

Y (tl) exp(iωmtl), ωm =

2πm

T

,

(3.27)

with integer m and ym = y∗
L−m. It can be shown that,
with the SPLOT assumption, the positive-frequency
components {ym; 0 < m < L/2} are independent zero-
mean complex Gaussian random variables with variances
SY (ωm|θ) [36, 43]. This means that the log-likelihood
function, up to a θ-independent additive constant A, can
be approximated as

ln PY ≈ A − (cid:88)

(cid:20)

ln SY (ωm|θ) +

|ym|2

SY (ωm|θ)

0<m<L/2

(cid:21)

.

(3.28)

Approximate maximum-likelihood estimation can then
be performed by Fourier-transforming the time series
into {ym} and ﬁnding the parameters that maximize
Eq. (3.28). We use Matlab(cid:114) and its fft and fminunc
functions to implement this procedure on a desktop PC.
With T = 0.01 s for each Y (t) trace, we expect the
SPLOT assumption to be reasonable. We also perform
numerical simulations throughout our analysis to ensure
that our SPLOT and unbiased-estimator assumptions are
valid and our results are expected.

collective record of all (cid:80)

To prevent technical noise and model mismatch at
higher frequencies from contaminating our analysis, we
consider only the spectral components up to 6×105 rad/s
∼ 10θ2, rather than the full measurement bandwidth
π/δt = π × 108 rad/s. To estimate the true parameters
more accurately, we apply the Whittle method to the
k Mk = 95 experimental X(t)
traces, assuming the spectrum given by Eq. (3.18), and
obtain θ1 = 0.1323 and θ2 = 5.909 × 104 rad/s. We take
these to be the true parameters, as the estimates from
such a large number of X(t) traces are expected to be
much more accurate than those from each Y (t) trace.

We apply the Whittle method to each Y (t) trace and
evaluate the estimation errors by comparing the esti-
mates with the true parameters. For each photon ﬂux
we assume a noise ﬂoor that is estimated from high-
frequency data, and then we estimate θ using spectral
components of Y up to ω = 6 × 105 rad/s. Let the re-
sulting estimates be

; µ = 1, 2; k = 1, 2, 3, 4; mk = 1, . . . , Mk

where µ is the index for the two parameters, k is the
index for the photon ﬂuxes, and mk is the index for the
traces, and let the squared distance of each estimate from
the true parameter be

The plots demonstrate estimation errors close to both the
homodyne limit and the fundamental quantum limit, de-
spite experimental imperfections such as imperfect phase
locking.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have presented three key results in this paper: a
measurement-independent quantum limit to spectrum-
parameter estimation, the optimality of spectral photon
counting, and an experimental data analysis. The quan-
tum limit applies to a wide range of experiments and is
particularly relevant to optomechanics, where the spec-
trum parameters of a stochastic force are often of interest
to gravitational-wave astronomy [3–5, 11]. The proposed
spectral photon counting method will be useful whenever
the problem can be modeled as weak phase modulation
of a coherent state and the SNR is low. Most metrolog-
ical experiments, including gravitational-wave detectors,
involve extremely weak phase modulation and low SNR,
so the potential improvement over homodyne or hetero-
dyne detection without the need of squeezed light is an
important discovery. Our experimental data analysis fur-
ther demonstrates the relevance of our theory to current
technology and provides a recipe for future spectrum-
analysis experiments.

There are many interesting potential extensions of our
theory. Although quantum baths can often be modeled
classically, a generalization of our formalism to account

explicitly for nonclassical baths will make our theory ap-
plicable to an even wider range of experiments. A gen-
eralization for nonstationary processes and ﬁnite obser-
vation time will be valuable for the study of unstable
systems, which are potentially more sensitive than sta-
ble systems [44]. Tighter quantum limits that explicitly
account for decoherence may be derived by applying the
techniques in Refs. [16, 27, 28]. A Bayesian formulation
that removes the unbiased-estimator assumption should
be possible [12, 14, 16, 45, 46]. A more detailed study
of our theory in the context of optomechanics can serve

sured voltages to the various physical quantities deﬁned
throughout Ref. [33].
In the course of analysing that
experimental data for the purposes of the new estima-
tion task described here, we found that the data gives
non-negligible bias in the estimation of θ1. It turns out
that the original calibration of experimental data was
not accurate enough for the new task of estimating θ1
(note that θ2 is robust against this inaccuracy). The sys-
tematic calibration error had insigniﬁcant eﬀects on the
phase estimation task in Ref. [33] – making the estimate
slightly worse than it would have been without the bias
but generally within the uncertainty of the experiment as
reported in Ref. [33]. The bias might have been caused
by non-linearity or saturation of electronic circuits during
the calibration phase of the experiment or long timescale
drift. For the purpose of this new estimation task, we
reﬁne the calibration of the data from Ref. [33] so that
we can achieve an accurate estimate. To do this in a fair
way we use two extra data sets (k = 5, 6), which were not
shown in Ref. [33] but recorded by the same experimental
setup with diﬀerent experimental parameters. Mean pho-
ton ﬂuxes of these data sets are N5 = 6.198×106 s−1 and
N6 = 5.986×106 s−1. Number of traces are M5 = 24 and
M6 = 24. Note that we use these “training” data only
for the purposes of reﬁning the experimental calibration.
We apply the Whittle method to the two extra data sets
to obtain the true θ1 from the collective record of X(t),
and a mean value of the estimated θ1 from the collective
record of Y (t) traces using the coarse calibration from
Ref. [33]. We determine that a reﬁned calibration factor
of 0.8945 is required to cancel the unwanted bias in the
estimate of θ1 for the extra data sets k = 5, 6. We then
apply the reﬁned calibration factor to Y (t) of the original
data sets (k = 1 to 4). By this method, we can reﬁne
the calibration of the original data presented in Ref. [33]
by making use of independent, but contemporaneously
recorded data.

as an extension of Refs. [4, 5] and enable a more rigor-
ous analysis of quantum limits to testing wavefunction-
collapse models. Application of our theory to spin sys-
tems will provide a more rigorous foundation for stochas-
tic magnetometry [29].

The actual performance of spectral photon counting
depends on the bandwidth and spectral resolution of the
Fourier-transform device, as well as the quantum eﬃ-
ciency and dark counts of the photodetectors in prac-
tice. While a more detailed analysis of such practical
concerns is needed before one can judge the realistic per-
formance of spectral photon counting with current tech-
nology, the large potential improvement in the low-SNR
regime indicates the fundamental importance of coher-
ent optical information processing for sensing applica-
tions and should motivate further technological advances
in coherent quantum optical devices [10, 38, 47–51]. In
the high-SNR regime, on the other hand, our theory and
experimental data analysis suggest that current technol-
ogy can already approach the quantum limits with ho-
modyne or even heterodyne detection.
In this regime,
our quantum limit primarily serves as a no-go theorem,
proving that no other measurement can oﬀer signiﬁcant
improvement. The challenge for actual metrological ex-
periments will be to reach the high-SNR regime for weak
signals, in which case our theory should serve as a rigor-
ous foundation to guide future experimental designs.
