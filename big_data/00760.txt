Abstract. Let Fq stand for the ﬁnite ﬁeld of odd characteristic p with q
elements (q = pn, n ∈ N) and F∗
q denote the set of all the nonzero elements of
Fq. Let m and t be positive integers. In this paper, by using the Smith normal
form of the exponent matrix, we obtain a formula for the number of rational
points on the variety deﬁned by the following system of equations over Fq:

each variable is a positive integer. Furthermore, under some natural conditions,
we arrive at an explicit formula for the number of the above variety. It extends
the results obtained previously by Wolfmann, Sun, Wang, Song, Chen, Hong,

1 Introduction and statement of main result

Let Fq be the ﬁnite ﬁeld of q elements with odd characteristic p (q = pn, n ∈ N
(the set of positive integers)) and F∗
q denote the nonzero elements of Fq. By
fi(x1, ..., xn) (i = 1, ..., m) we denote some polynomials with n variables over
Fq and V stands for the following algebraic variety over Fq:



Let Nq(V ) denote the number of Fq-rational points on the algebraic variety V
in Fn
q |fi(x1, ..., xn) = 0, i = 1, ..., m}.
Especially, we use Nq(f ) to denote Nq(V ) if m = 1.

q . That is, Nq(V ) = #{(x1, ..., xn) ∈ Fn

Studying the exact value of Nq(V ) is one of the main topics in ﬁnite ﬁelds.
The degrees deg(fi) play an important role in the estimate of Nq(V ). Let ⌈x⌉
denote the least integer ≥ x and ordq denote the additive valuation such that
ordqq = 1.
In 1964, Ax [3] generalized the Chevalley-Warning theorem by
showing that

ordqNq(V ) ≥l n −Pm

Later, further works were done by Katz [17], Adolphson-Sperber [1] -[2], Moreno-
Moreno [19] and Wan [25]-[27].

It is diﬃcult to give an explicit formula for Nq(V ) in general. Finding explicit
formula for Nq(f ) under certain conditions has attracted many authors for many
years (see, for instance, [15] et al). It is well known that there exists an explicit
formula for Nq(f ) with deg(f ) ≤ 2 in Fq (see, for example, [16] and [18]). One
ﬁrst considered the diagonal hypersurface:

a1xe1

1 + ... + anxen

n − b = 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, ai ∈ F∗

q, b ∈ Fq, ei > 0,

(1.1)

and much work has been done to seek for the number of rational points of the hy-
persurface (1.1), see, for instance, [23] and [30]-[31]. Carlitz [7], Cohen [10] and
Hodges [11] counted the rational points on the following k-linear hypersurface

a1x11...x1k + a2x21...x2k + ... + anxn1...xnk − b = 0,

(1.2)

with ai ∈ F∗
on the following more general diagonal hypersurface

q, b ∈ Fq. Cao [4], Cao and Sun [5] [6] studied the rational points

with 1 ≤ i ≤ r, 1 ≤ j ≤ ni, eij ∈ N, ai ∈ F∗

(1.2) when b = 0. On the other hand, Pan, Zhao and Cao [20] considered the
following hypersurface (a1xm1

the results of Carlitz in [8] and [9].

1 ≤ i ≤ s and 1 ≤ j ≤ n, b ∈ Fq, then a formula for Nq(f ) was given by Sun
[24]. Moreover, if s = n and gcd(det(eij ), q − 1) = 1 (det(eij) represents the

determinant of the n × n matrix(cid:0)eij(cid:1), then Sun [24] gave the explicit formula

for the number of rational points as follows:

n − b with eij > 0 and ai ∈ F∗

q, b ∈ Fq. In 2005, Wang and Sun [29] extended the results
of [24] and [28]. Recently, Hu, Hong and Zhao [13] generalized Wang and Sun’s
results. In fact, they used the Smith normal form to present a formula for Nq(f )
with f being given by:

where the integers t > 0, r0 = 0 < r1 < r2 < ... < rt, 1 ≤ n1 < n2 < ... < nt,
b ∈ Fq, ai ∈ F∗
q (1 ≤ i ≤ rt) and the exponents eij of each variable are positive
integers.

On the other hand, Yang [32] followed Sun’s method and gave a formula for

the rational points Nq(V ) on the following variety V over Fq:

Very recently, Song and Chen [22] continued to make use of Sun’s method and
obtained a formula for Nq(V ) with V being the variety over Fq deﬁned by:

Meanwhile, they proposed an open problem. To state this question, we need to
introduce some notation. In what follows, we always let t, m, r1, ..., rt, n1, ..., nt
be positive integers such that r1 < ... < rt, 1 ≤ n1 < ... < nt and r0 = 0. For any
integers i, j and k with 1 ≤ i ≤ rt, 0 ≤ j ≤ t − 1 and 1 ≤ k ≤ m, let e(k)

The following interesting question was raised in [22].

Problem 1.1.

[22] Let f1(x), ..., fm(x) be given as in (1.3). What is the
formula for the number of rational points on the variety deﬁned by the following
system of equations over Fq:

f1(x) = 0,

fm(x) = 0?

When m = 1, this question has been answered by Hu, Hong and Zhao [13].
When t = 2, this question was answered by Song and Chen [22]. However, if
m ≥ 2 and t ≥ 3, then this problem has not been solved yet and is still kept
open so far. Note that a more general question was proposed in [13] and a
partial answer to this general question was given in [12].

In this paper, our main goal is to investigate Problem 1.1. We will follow
and develop the method of [13] to study Problem 1.1. To state the main result,
we ﬁrst need to introduce some related concept and notation. For 1 ≤ k ≤ m,
the exponent matrix of fk(x), denoted Efk , is deﬁned to be the rt × nt matrix

we deﬁne

denoted by indα(β) := r.

Evidently, Theorem 1.2 extends the main results of [13] and [22], and answers
completely Problem 1.1.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall some useful known
lemmas which will be needed later. Subsequently, in Section 3, we make use
of the results presented in Section 2 to show Theorem 1.2. Also we supply
some interesting corollaries. Finally, in Section 4, we provide two examples to
demonstrate the validity of Theorem 1.2.

Throughout this paper, we use gcd(a, m) to denote the greatest common

divisor of any positive integers a and m.

2 Preliminary lemmas

In this section, we present some useful lemmas that are needed in section 3. We
ﬁrst recall two well known deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 2.1. [14] Let M be a square integer matrix. If the determinant

of M is ±1, then M is called a unimodular matrix.

Deﬁnition 2.2. [14] For given any positive integers m and n, let P and Q
be two m × n integer matrices. Suppose that there are two modular matrices U
of order m and V of order n such that P = U QV . Then we say that P and Q
are equivalent and we write P ∼ Q.

Clearly, the equivalence has the three properties of being reﬂexive, symmet-

ric and transitive.

Lemma 2.1. [14] [21] Let P be a nonzero m × n integer matrix. Then P is

equivalent to a block matrix of the following form

(cid:18) D 0
0 (cid:19) ,

0

6

(2.1)

where D = diag(d1, ..., dr) with all the diagonal elements di being positive inte-
gers and satisfying that di|di+1 (1 ≤ i < r). In other words, there are unimod-
ular matrices U of order m and V of order n such that

U P V =(cid:18) diag(d1, ..., dr) 0
0 (cid:19) .

0

We call the diagonal matrix in (2.1) the Smith normal form of the matrix P .
Usually, one writes the Smith normal form of P as SNF(P ). The elements di
are unique up to multiplication by a unit and are called the elementary divisors,
invariants, or invariant factors.

For any system of linear congruences

j=1 h1jyj ≡ b1
............
j=1 hsjyj ≡ bs

(mod m),

(mod m),

(2.2)



Pn
Pn

let Y = (y1, ..., yn)T be the column of indeterminates y1, ..., yn, B = (b1, ..., bs)T
and H = (hij) be the matrix of its coeﬃcient. Then one can write (2.2) as

HY ≡ B (mod m).

(2.3)

By Lemma 2.1, there are unimodular matrices U of order s and V of order n
such that

U HV = SNF(H) =(cid:18) diag(d1, ..., dr) 0
0 (cid:19) .

0

Consequently, we have the following lemma.

Lemma 2.2. [13] Let B′ = (b′

linear congruences is solvable if and only if gcd(m, di)|b′
1 ≤ i ≤ r and m|b′

s)T = U B. Then the system (2.3) of
i for all integers i with
i for all integers i with r + 1 ≤ i ≤ s. Further, the number of

1, ..., b′

solutions of (2.3) is equal to mn−rQr

The following result is due to Sun [24].

i=1 gcd(m, di).

Lemma 2.3. [24] Let c1, ..., ck ∈ F∗

number of rational points (x1, ..., xk) ∈ (F∗
ckxk = c. Then

q and c ∈ Fq, and let N (c) denote the
q)k on the hypersurface c1x1 + ... +

N (c) =( (q−1)k+(−1)k(q−1)

(q−1)k−(−1)k

q

,

if c = 0,

, otherwise.

Lemma 2.4. Let cij ∈ F∗

q for all integers i and j with 1 ≤ i ≤ m and
1 ≤ j ≤ k and c1, ..., cm ∈ Fq. Let N (c1, ..., cm) denote the number of rational

7

points (x11, ..., x1k, ..., xm1, ..., xmk) ∈ (F∗

q)mk on the following variety



Then

c11x11 + ... + c1kx1k = c1,
......
cm1xm1 + ... + cmkxmk = cm.

(2.4)

N (c1, ..., cm) =

(q − 1)r

qm ((q − 1)k−1 + (−1)k)r((q − 1)k − (−1)k)m−r,

where r := #{1 ≤ i ≤ m|ci = 0}.

Proof. For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, let N (ci) denote the number of rational points
q)k on the hypersurface ci1xi1 + ... + cikxik = ci. Since for any
q)mk on the variety (2.4), the

(xi1, ..., xik) ∈ (F∗
rational points (x11, ..., x1k, ..., xm1, ..., xmk) ∈ (F∗
involved variables are diﬀerent from equation to equation, one has

N (c1, ..., cm) =

N (ci).

mYi=1

So Lemma 2.3 applied to N (ci) gives us the required result. Hence Lemma 2.4
is proved.
✷

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let k be a positive integer. We say that the column vec-

tor 

c1
...
ck

 ∈ Zk of dimension k divides the column vector 

d1
...
dk

dimension k if ci divides di for all integers i with 1 ≤ i ≤ k. The divisibility
between two row integer vectors can be deﬁned similarly.

 ∈ Zk of

Lemma 2.5. Let α, β be two primitive elements of F∗

q and k be a positive in-
teger. Let u1, ..., uk be nonzero elements of Fq and each of d1, ..., dk divides q −1.
Let U be a unimodular matrix. Then (d1, ..., dk)T divides U (indαu1, ..., indαuk)T
if and only if (d1, ..., dk)T divides U (indβu1, ..., indβuk)T .

Proof. First of all, for any integer i with 1 ≤ i ≤ k, one has

indαui ≡ indαβindβui

(mod q − 1).

It then follows that

U

indαu1

...

indαuk

 ≡ indαβ · U

indβu1

...

indβuk

 (mod q − 1).

(2.5)

On the one hand, since all of d1, ..., dk divide q − 1, by (2.5) one knows that
(d1, ..., dk)T divides U (indαu1, ..., indαuk)T if and only if (d1, ..., dk)T divides
indαβ · U (indβu1, ..., indβuk)T .

8

On the other hand, since α and β are primitive elements, indαβ is coprime
to q − 1. Hence indαβ is coprime to each of d1, ..., dk. Then one can derive that
(d1, ..., dk)T divides indαβ · U (indβu1, ..., indβuk)T if and only if (d1, ..., dk)T
divides U (indβu1, ..., indβuk)T .

Finally, the desired result follows immediately. So Lemma 2.5 is proved. ✷

Remark 2.1. If Nl(α) stands for the number of rational points (u11, ..., u1rl ,
q)mrl of (1.5) under the extra conditions (1.6) with respect
..., um1, ..., umrl) ∈ (F∗
to the primitive element α, then by Lemma 2.5 we have that Nl(β) = Nl(γ)
for any primitive elements β and γ. So we can use Nl to denote the number of
q )mrl of (1.5) under the extra
rational points (u11, ..., u1rl, ..., um1, ..., umrl) ∈ (F∗
conditions (1.6) with respect to any given primitive element α.

3 Proof of Theorem 1.2

In this section, we give the proof of Theorem 1.2. First, we present some notation
and two lemmas. For any given (u11, ..., u1rt, ..., um1, ..., um,rt) ∈ Fmrt

, we use

with bk and aki (1 6 k 6 m, 1 6 i 6 rt) being given as in (1.3).

Let T (0) consist of zero vector of dimension mrt. For any integer n with
1 ≤ n ≤ rt, let T (n) denote the subset of T in which the vector holds exactly
mn nonzero components. Deﬁne

Then we have the following lemma.

Lemma 3.1. One has

Now let (u11, ..., u1rt, ..., um1, ..., um,rt) ∈ T and consider the rational points

one can easily deduce that for any given integer i with 0 < i < rt, if uki =
0, then uk,i+1 = 0. Thus if (u11, ..., u1rt, ..., um1, ..., um,rt) ∈ T is a nonzero
vector, then it must hold exactly mn nonzero components for some integer n
with 1 ≤ n ≤ rt. For any integer n with 1 ≤ n ≤ rt, let T (n) denote the
subset of T in which the vector holds exactly mn nonzero components. So if
(u11, ..., u1rt, ..., um1, ..., um,rt) ∈ T (n), then we have that uk1 6= 0, ..., ukn 6= 0
and uk,n+1 = ... = uk,rt = 0 for all integers k with 1 ≤ k ≤ m. We claim that
if (u11, ..., u1rt, ..., um1, ..., um,rt) ∈ T holds exactly mn nonzero components,
then n equals one of r1, ..., rt.
In the following we will prove the claim. Let
n ∈ {1, 2, ..., rt} \ {r1, ..., rt}. Then one can ﬁnd an integer l with 1 ≤ l ≤ t such
that rl−1 < n < rl. Assume that T (n) is nonempty. On the one hand, by the
deﬁnition of T (n), one has uk1 6= 0, ..., ukn 6= 0 and uk,n+1 = ... = uk,rt = 0 for
all integers k with 1 ≤ k ≤ m. On the other hand, from uk,n+1 = 0, and noting

(k)
n,1

e(k)

that ukn = x
, we infer that ukn = 0.

This contradicts to ukn 6= 0. So the assumption is not true, and the claim is
proved.

Since ukrl 6= 0 and ukrl = x

i = uki, 1 ≤ k ≤ m, 1 ≤ i ≤ rl and xnl+1...xnl+1 = 0}.

11

Since each of the components xnl+1+1, ..., xnt can run over the whole ﬁnite ﬁeld

(3.8)

Notice that the choice of (x1, ..., xnl ) ∈ (F∗

(k = 1, ..., m, i = 1, ..., rl) is independent of the choice of (xnl+1, ..., xnl+1 ) ∈

So by (3.8) to (3.10), one obtains that

. This concludes the proof of Lemma 3.2.

✷

We can now turn our attention to the proof of Theorem 1.2.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. First we show that the following is true:

:=(cid:26) N (n1,...,nt)

r0

0,

if b1 = ... = bm = 0,
otherwise.

does not contain the original point (0, ..., 0) ∈ Fmrt
follows from (3.2) that M (n1,...,nt)

q

= 0. That is, the second part of (3.17) is true.
Now let b1 = ... = bm = 0. Then T (0) consists of zero vector of dimension

0

. So T (0) is empty. It then

mrt. Thus by (3.2), we have

M (n1,...,nt)

as required. This completes the proof of (3.17).

Consequently, we show that for all integers n ∈ {1, ..., rt} \ {r1, ..., rt}, one

has

(3.18)
To prove it, we choose an n ∈ {1, 2, ..., rt} \ {r1, ..., rt}. Then there exists an
integer l with 1 ≤ l ≤ t such that rl−1 < n < rl. Claim that T (n) is empty
which will be shown in what follows.

n

M (n1,...,nt)

Suppose that T (n) is nonempty. On the one hand, the deﬁnition of T (n)
gives us that for all integers k with 1 ≤ k ≤ m, we have uk1 6= 0,...,ukn 6= 0 and
uk,n+1 = ... = uk,rt = 0. On the other hand, from uk,n+1 = 0, and noting that

we deduce that ukn = 0. This contradicts with the fact ukn 6= 0. So the
assumption is not true. Hence T (n) = ∅. Thus by (3.2),

M (n1,...,nt)

n

= 0.

This ﬁnishes the proof of (3.18).

Finally, using Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2, (3.17) and (3.18), the desired result fol-

lows immediately. So Theorem 1.2 is proved.

In concluding this section, we present an interesting corollary.

Corollary 3.1. If SNF(E(l)) = (D(l) 0) and gcd(det D(l), q − 1) = 1 for all
integers l with 1 ≤ l ≤ t, then the number N (n1,...,nt) of rational points on the

Proof. Since SNF(E(l)) = (D(l)

0) and gcd(det D(l), q − 1) = 1 for all

integers l with 1 ≤ l ≤ t, we derive that

sl = mrl and gcd(q − 1, d(l)

j ) = 1

for all integers j with 1 ≤ j ≤ sl. Thus for any solution (u11, ..., u1,rl, ..., um1, ...,
q)mrl of (1.5), the extra conditions (1.6) are always true. It then
um,rl) ∈ (F∗
follows from Theorem 1.2 and Lemma 2.4 that the desired result follows imme-
diately. This ﬁnishes the proof of Corollary 3.1.

4 Two examples

In this section, we supply two examples to illustrate the validity of our main

We deduce that the conditions (1.6) that gcd(6, 9)|3 hold. It follows that N1 = 1.
So
