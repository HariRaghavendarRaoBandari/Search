1 ENCODABILITY AND OMNISCIENT REDUCTIONS

BENOIT MONIN AND LUDOVIC PATEY

Abstract. A set of integers A is computably encodable if every inﬁnite set
of integers has an inﬁnite subset computing A. By a result of Solovay, the
computably encodable sets are exactly the hyperarithmetic ones.
In this
paper, we extend this notion of computable encodability to subsets of the
Baire space and we characterize the Π0
1 encodable compact sets as those who
admit a non-empty Σ1
1 subset. Thanks to this equivalence, we prove that
weak weak K¨onig’s lemma is not strongly computably reducible to Ramsey’s
theorem. This answers a question of Hirschfeldt and Jockusch.

1. Introduction

A set A ⊆ ω is computably encodable if every inﬁnite set X ⊆ ω has an
inﬁnite subset computing A. Jockusch and Soare [15] introduced various notions
of encodability and Solovay [22] characterized the computably encodable sets as
the hyperarithmetical ones. We extend the notion of computable encodability
to collections of sets as follows. A set C ⊆ ωω is Π0
1 encodable if every inﬁnite set
X ⊆ ω has an inﬁnite subset Y such that C admits a non-empty Y -computably
bounded Π0,Y
subset D ⊆ ωω. By this, we mean that D = [T ] for some Y -
computable tree T whose nodes are bounded by a Y -computable function. Our
main result asserts that the compact sets that are Π0
1 encodable are exactly
those admitting a non-empty Σ1
1 subset. This extends Solovay’s theorem as the
members of the Σ1
1 singletons
are exactly the hyperarithmetic ones [23] and the computable ones, respectively.
Our motivations follow two axis.

First, the development of mass problems such as Muchnik and Medvedev
degrees [10] revealed ﬁner computational behaviors than those captured by the
Turing degrees. For example, the cone avoidance basis theorem [14] asserts
that the PA degrees are of no help to compute a single incomputable set of
integers. However, it would be simplistic to deduce that PA degrees carry no
computational power. For example, they enable one to compute separating sets
given two computably inseparable c.e. sets. This work can therefore be seen
as part of a program of extending core computability-theoretic theorems about
Turing degrees to their generalized statements about mass problems.

Our second motivation comes from the reverse mathematics and the com-
putable analysis of Ramsey’s theorem. Computable encodability is a very im-
portant feature of Ramsey’s theorem, as for every k-coloring of [ω]n, and every
inﬁnite set X, there is an inﬁnite homogeneous subset contained in X. Com-
putable encodability provides a formal setting to many intuitions about the
computational weakness of Ramsey’s theorem. In particular, we use this notion

to answer a question asked by Hirschfeldt and Jockusch [11] about the link be-
tween variants of K¨onig’s lemma and Ramsey’s theorem over strong computable
reducibility.

1.1. Reductions between mathematical problems

A mathematical problem P is speciﬁed by a collection of instances, coming
together with a collection of solutions. Many ordinary theorems can be seen as
mathematical problems. For example, K¨onig’s lemma (KL) asserts that every
inﬁnite, ﬁnitely branching tree admits an inﬁnite path. In this setting, an in-
stance of KL is an inﬁnite, ﬁnitely branching tree T , and a solution to T is any
inﬁnite path P ∈ [T ].

There are many ways to compare the strength of mathematical problems.
Among them, reverse mathematics study their logical consequences [21]. More
recently, various notions of eﬀective reductions have been proposed to compare
mathematical problems, namely, Weihrauch reductions [1, 3], computable reduc-
tions [11], computable entailment [20], among others. A problem P is computably
reducible to another problem Q (written P ≤c Q) if every P-instance I computes
a Q-instance J such that every solution to J computes relative to I a solu-
tion to I. P is Weihrauch reducible to Q (written P ≤W Q) if moreover this
computable reduction is witnessed by two ﬁxed Turing functionals. There ex-
ist strong variants of computable and Weihrauch reductions written P ≤sc Q
and P ≤sW Q, respectively, where no access to the P-instance I is allowed in
the backward reduction.
In this article, we shall focus on strong computable
reduction.

Due to the range of potential deﬁnitions of eﬀective reductions, there is a need
to give a justiﬁcation about the choices of the deﬁnition. An eﬀective reduction
from P to Q should reﬂect some computational aspect of the relationship between
P and Q. The more precise the reduction is, the more insights it gives about
the links between the two problems. As it happens, many proofs that P is not
strongly computably reducible to Q actually produce a single P-instance I such
that for every Q-instance J, computable in I or not, there is a solution to J
computing no solution to I. Such a relation suggests a deep structural diﬀerence
between the problems P and Q, in that even with a perfect knowledge of I,
there is no way to encode enough information in the Q-instance to solve I. We
shall therefore deﬁne P to be strongly omnisciently computably reducible to Q
(written P ≤soc Q) if for every P-instance I, there is a Q-instance J such that
every solution to J computes a solution to I.

1.2. K¨onig’s lemma and Ramsey’s theorem

K¨onig’s lemma and Ramsey’s theorem are core theorems from mathematics,

both enjoying a special status in reverse mathematics.

Deﬁnition 1.1 (Various K¨onig lemmas) KL is the statement “Every inﬁnite
ﬁnitely-branching tree has an inﬁnite path”. WKL is the restriction of KL to
binary trees. WWKL is the restriction of WKL to binary trees of positive measure
(A binary tree T ⊆ 2<ω has positive measure if lims

|{σ∈T :|σ|=s}|

2s

> 0).

Weak K¨onig’s lemma captures compactness arguments and naturally arises
from the study of ordinary theorems [21]. It is part of the so called Big Five [16].

On the other hand, weak weak K¨onig’s lemma can be thought of as asserting
the existence of randomness in the sense of Martin-L¨of [4]. Although weak
K¨onig’s lemma is strictly weaker than K¨onig’s lemma in reverse mathematics and
over computable reducibility, the statements are trivially equivalent over strong
omniscient computable reducibility.
Indeed, given any problem P admitting
an instance with at least one solution S, one can deﬁne a binary tree whose
unique path is a binary coding of S. In particular, KL ≤soc WKL. Weak weak
K¨onig’s lemma, as for him, remains strictly weaker than K¨onig’s lemma over
strong omniscient computable reducibility, since the measure of the set of oracles
computing a non-computable set is null [18]. Therefore one can choose any tree
with a unique incomputable path as an instance of K¨onig’s lemma to show that
KL (cid:2)soc WWKL

Deﬁnition 1.2 (Ramsey’s theorem) A subset H of ω is homogeneous for a
coloring f : [ω]n → k (or f -homogeneous) if each n-tuples over H are given the
same color by f . RTn
k is the statement “Every coloring f : [ω]n → k has an
inﬁnite f -homogeneous set”, RTn

k and RT is (∀n) RTn

<∞ is (∀k) RTn

<∞.

k is strictly in between RCA0 and RT3

Ramsey’s theorem received a lot of attention in reverse mathematics since it
is one of the ﬁrst examples of statements escaping the Big Five phenomenon.
There is profusion of litterature around the reverse mathematics and computable
analysis of Ramsey’s theorem [13, 19, 2, 12]. In particular, RTn
k is equivalent
to KL in reverse mathematics for any standard n ≥ 3 and k ≥ 2 [21] and
RT2
k [19]. More recently, there has been
studies of Ramsey’s theorem under various notions of reducibility. Let SRT2

denote the restriction of RT2
k to stable colorings, that is, functions f : [ω]2 →

and Rakotoniaina [1] and Hirschfeldt and Jockusch [11] studied the Weihrauch
degrees of Ramsey’s theorem and independently proved that RT1
k+1 6≤W SRT2
k
and RTn
k trivially holds.
From the point of view of omniscient reductions, the above discussion about
weak K¨onig’s lemma shows that RT ≤soc WKL. Dzhafarov and Jockusch [5]
proved that SRT2
<∞. Hirschfeldt and Jockusch [11] and Patey [17]
independently proved that RT1
k, later strengthened by Dzhafarov,
Patey, Solomon and Westrick [6], who proved that RT1
k and that
RT2
<∞. Some diﬀerences between strong computable reducibility and
strong omniscient computable reducibility are witnessed by Ramsey’s theorem.
For example, the second author [17] proved that SRT2
k, while the
following argument shows that SRT2
2: Given a stable coloring f :
[ω]2 → k, let g(x, y) = 1 iﬀ f (x, y) = lims f (y, s). Every inﬁnite g-homogeneous
set is for color 1 and is an f -homogeneous set.

over strong omniscient computable reducibility and proved that RT1

and that WKL 6≤soc RT. They asked whether weak weak K¨onig’s lemma is
a consequence of Ramsey’s theorem over strong computable reducibility. We
answer negatively by proving the stronger separation WWKL 6≤soc RT.

1.3. Notation

Given a set A and some integer n ∈ ω, we let [A]n denote the collection of all
unordered subsets of A of size n. Accordingly, we let A<ω and [A]ω denote the
collection of all ﬁnite and inﬁnite subsets of A, respectively. Given a ∈ [ω]<ω and
X ∈ [ω]ω such that max a < min X, we let ha, Xi denote the set of all B ∈ [ω]ω
such that a ⊆ B ⊆ a ∪ X. The pairs ha, Xi are called Mathias conditions and
form, together with ∅, the basic open sets of the Ellentuck topology.

Given a function f ∈ ωω and an integer t ∈ ω, we write f t for the set of all
strings σ ∈ ω<ω of length t such that (∀x < t)σ(x) ≤ f (x). Accordingly, we
write f <ω for St∈ω f t.

2. Computable encodability

A function f ∈ ωω is a Π0

1 modulus of a set C ⊆ ωω if C has a non-empty g-
computably bounded Π0,g
subset for every function g ≥ f . A function f ∈ ωω is
a modulus of a set A ∈ ωω if g ≥T A for every g ≥ f . Note that the notion of Π0
1
modulus of the singleton {A} coincides with the existing notion of modulus of the
set A since the members of computably bounded Π0
1 singletons are computable.
The purpose of this section is to prove the following main theorem.

Theorem 2.1 Fix a compact set C ⊆ ωω. The following are equivalent:

1 encodable

(i) C is Π0
(ii) C admits a Π0
(iii) C has a non-empty Σ1

1 modulus

1 subset

Proof. (ii) ⇒ (i): Let f be a Π0
1 modulus of C. For every set X ∈ [ω]ω, there is a
set Y ∈ [X]ω such that pY ≥ f , where pY (x) is the xth element of Y in increasing
order. In particular, C has a non-empty Π0,Y
subset. (iii) ⇒ (ii): Let R(X, Y, z)
be a computable predicate such that D = {X ∈ ωω : (∃Y ∈ ωω)(∀z)R(X, Y, z)}
is a non-empty subset of C. Since D 6= ∅, there are some X, Y ∈ ωω such that
R(X, Y, z) holds for every z ∈ ω. We claim that the function f deﬁned by f (x) =
max(X(x), Y (x)) is a Π0
1 modulus of C. To see this, pick any function g ≥ f .
The set {X ≤ g : (∀z ∈ ω)(∃ρ ∈ gz)(∀y < z)R(X, ρ, y)} is a non-empty Π0,g
subset of C bounded by g. The remainder of this section will be dedicated to the
proof of (i) ⇒ (iii).

Corollary 2.2 (Solovay [23], Groszek and Slaman [9]) Fix a set A ∈ ωω. The
following are equivalent:

(i) A is computably encodable
(ii) A admits a modulus
(iii) A is hyperarithmetic

Proof. By Theorem 2.1, it suﬃces to prove that A is computably encodable,
admits a modulus, and is hyperarithmetic if and only if {A} is Π0
1 encodable,
admits a Π0
1 subset, respectively.

1 modulus and has a non-empty Σ1

By Spector [23], a set A ∈ ωω is hyperarithmetic iﬀ it is the unique member of a
1 singleton set C ⊆ ωω. Therefore, A is hyperarithmetic iﬀ {A} has a non-empty
1 subset. Every modulus of A ∈ ωω is a Π0
1 modulus of {A}. Conversely, if {A}
1 modulus f , then for every g ≥ f , {A} is a g-computably bounded

computably encodable, then {A} is Π0
1 encodable since every X-computable set
is an X-computably bounded Π0,X
singleton. Conversely, suppose that {A} is Π0

encodable. Then, for every set X ∈ [ω]ω, there is a set Y ∈ [X]ω such that {A}
is a Y -computably bounded Π0

A basis for the Σ1

1 sets is a collection of sets B ⊆ ωω such that B ∩ D 6= ∅
for every non-empty Σ1
1 set D ⊆ ωω. Gandy, Kreisel and Tait [8] proved that
whenever a set A ∈ ωω is non-hyperarithmetic, every non-empty Σ1
1 set D ⊆
ωω has a member X such that A is not hyperarithmetic in X. We need to
extend their basis theorem by replacing non-hyperarithmetic sets by compact
sets with no non-empty Σ1
1 subsets in order to prove the remaining direction of
Theorem 2.1. Note that when we apply Theorem 2.3 with C = {A} for some
non-hyperarithmetic set A, we get back the non-hyperarithmetic basis theorem
of Gandy, Kreisel and Tait.

Theorem 2.3 is an easy consequence of the following lemma.

Proof. We reason by case analysis. In the ﬁrst case, {Y ∈ ωω : P (X, Y )} ( C
for some X ∈ D. Let Y 6∈ C be such that P (X, Y ) holds. By closure of C,
there is some ﬁnite initial segment σ ≺ Y such that [σ] ∩ C = ∅. The Σ1
1
set E = {X ∈ D : (∃Y ≻ σ)P (X, Y )} is non-empty and satisﬁes the desired
properties. In the second case, for every X ∈ D, {Y ∈ ωω : P (X, Y )} ⊆ C. Then
{Y ∈ ωω : (∃X ∈ D)P (X, Y )} is a Σ1
1 subset of C, and therefore must be empty.
We can simply choose E = D.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 2.3. Let us consider for any Σ1
1 predicate P (X, Y ), the union
UP of all the Σ1
1 sets E such that {Y ∈ ωω : P (X, Y )} 6⊆ C for every X ∈ E. By
Lemma 2.4, each UP is dense for the Gandy-Harrington topology (where open
sets are those generated by the Σ1
It is well known that ωω with the
Gandy-Harrington topology is a Baire space. It follows that TP UP is dense. In
particular it has a non-empty intersection with any Σ1

the deﬁnition of UP that C contains no Σ1,X

We will now prove the core lemma from which we will deduce the last direction
of Theorem 2.1. In what follows, we assume that Γ ranges over trees, that is, if
Γv(τ ) ↓, then Γv(σ) ↓ for every σ (cid:22) τ .

Lemma 2.5 Fix a set X ∈ [ω]ω and a compact set C ⊆ ωω with no non-
empty Σ1,X
subset. For every continuous function Γ and every t ∈ ω, there is a
set Y ∈ [X]ω such that for every G ∈ [Y ]ω, either C ∩ [ΓG] = ∅ or ΓG(σ) ↓= 1

for some string σ ∈ ω<ω of length at least t such that C ∩ [σ] = ∅. Moreover, we
can choose Y so that C has no Σ1,Y

subset.

Proof. Given v ∈ [ω]<ω and n ∈ ω, let Sv

Suppose ﬁrst that for every ℓ ∈ ω, there is some σ ∈ ω<ω of length ℓ such that
Qσ 6= ∅. If Qσ 6= ∅ for some σ ∈ ω<ω of length at least t such that C ∩ [σ] = ∅,
then by Theorem 2.3, there is some Y ∈ Qσ such that C has no non-empty
Σ1,Y
subset. Such a Y and σ satisfy the desired properties. If C ∩ [σ] 6= ∅ for
every σ ∈ ω<ω of length at least t such that Qσ 6= ∅, then by compactness
of C, the set {h ∈ ωω : (∀σ ≺ h)Qσ 6= ∅} is a non-empty Σ1,X
subset of C,
contradicting our hypothesis.

Suppose now that there is some ℓ ∈ ω such that Qσ = ∅ for every σ ∈ ω<ω
of length l. Let σ0, . . . , σn−1 be the ﬁnite sequence of all σ ∈ ωℓ such that
C ∩ [σ] 6= ∅. This sequence is ﬁnite by compactness of C. Let E be the Σ1,X
collection of all Y ∈ [X]ω such that for every v ∈ [Y ]<ω and every i < n,
σi 6∈ Sv
ℓ . We claim that E is non-empty. To see this, deﬁne a ﬁnite decreasing
sequence X = X0 ⊇ X1 ⊇ · · · ⊇ Xn of inﬁnite sets such that for every i < n and
every v ∈ [Xi+1]<ω, σi 6∈ Sv
ℓ as follows. Given i < n, and since Qσi = ∅, apply
the Galvin-Prikry theorem [7] relative to Xi to obtain a set Xn+1 ∈ [Xi]ω such
ℓ for every v ∈ [Xi+1]<ω. By Theorem 2.3, there is some Y ∈ E such
that σi 6∈ Sv
that C has no non-empty Σ1,Y
subset. Such a Y satisﬁes the desired conditions.
This completes the proof.

Lemma 2.6 Fix a Mathias condition ha, Xi and a compact set C ⊆ ωω with no

either C ∩ [ΓH] = ∅ or ΓH(σ) ↓= 1 for some string σ ∈ ω<ω of length at least t
such that C ∩ [σ] = ∅. Moreover, we can choose Y so that C has no Σ1,Y

Proof. Let a0, . . . , an−1 be the ﬁnite listing of all subsets of a, and for every i < n,
i = Γai∪Z. By iterating Lemma 2.5
let Γi be the continuous function deﬁned by ΓZ
on each Γi, we obtain a set Y ∈ [X]ω such that C has no non-empty Σ1,Y
subset,
and for every Z ∈ [Y ]ω, and every i < n, either C ∩ [ΓZ

Therefore, either C ∩ [ΓH] = C ∩ [ΓZ
string σ ∈ ω<ω of length at least t such that C ∩ [σ] = ∅.

Proof of Theorem 2.1, (i) ⇒ (iii). We now prove that if a compact set C ⊆ ωω

G ∈ [Y ]ω, every G-computably bounded Π0,G

set is not included in C.

By iterating Lemma 2.6, build an inﬁnite sequence of Mathias conditions

By construction, for every G ∈ [Y ]ω and every j ∈ ω, either C ∩ [ΦG

{σ ∈ ω<ω : ΦG

Corollary 2.7 WWKL 6≤soc RT.

Proof. Let T ⊆ 2<ω be a tree of positive measure such that [T ] has no non-empty
Σ1
1 subset. Take for example T to be a tree whose inﬁnite paths are the elements
of a Π0,O
set of Martin-L¨of randoms relatively to Kleene’s O. As the sets that
are Turing below Kleene’s O are a basis for the Σ1
1 subsets of 2ω, [T ] cannot have
any Σ1

1 subset.

Fix an RT-instance f and suppose that every inﬁnite f -homogeneous set H
computes a inﬁnite path through T . In particular, [T ] has a non-empty Π0,H
subset. Since for every set X ∈ [ω]ω, there is an f -homogeneous set Y ∈ [X]ω,

Proof. For any X ∈ [ω]ω, either X ∩ Z, or X ∩ Z is inﬁnite and therefore belongs
to CZ . Thus CZ is Π0
1 encodable. Also as the sets Turing below Kleene’s O are
a basis for the Σ1

In this last section, we summarize the relations between variants of Ramsey’s
theorem and of K¨onig’s lemma over strong omniscient computable reducibility,
and state two remaining open questions.

colors and the size of the tuples has a structural impact reﬂected over strong
omniscient computable reducibility.
