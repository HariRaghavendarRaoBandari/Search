A number of network structural characteristics have recently been the subject of particularly intense research,
including degree distributions [1], community structure [2, 3], and various measures of vertex centrality [4, 5],
to mention only a few. Vertices may have attributes associated with them; for example, properties of proteins
in protein-protein interaction networks [6], users’ social network proﬁles [7], or authors’ publication histories in
co-authorship networks [8]. In a network, two vertices might be considered similar if they have similar attributes
(features, properties), or they can be considered similar based solely on the network structure. Similarity of this
type is called structural similarity, to distinguish it from properties similarity, social similarity, textual similarity,
functional similarity or other similarity types found in networks. Here we focus on the similarity problem by com-
puting (1) for each vertex a vector of structural features, called signature vector, based on the number of graphlets
associated with the vertex, and (2) for the network its graphlet correlation matrix, measuring graphlets dependen-
cies and hence revealing unknown organizational principles of the network. Real-world networks are directed and
often have few types of vertices with well deﬁned structural (topological) characteristics. We found that real-world
networks generally have very different structural characteristics resulting in different graphlet correlation matrices.
In particular, the graphlet correlation matrix of the brain effective network is computed for 40 healthy subjects
and common (present in more than 70% subjects) dependencies are raveled. Thus, negative correlations are found
for 2-node graphlets and 3-node graphlets that are wedges and positive correlations are found only for 3-node
graphlets that are triangles. Graphlets characteristics in directed networks could further signiﬁcantly increase our
understanding of real-world networks.

Quantifying similarity between vertices in a network is an old problem. Researches have proposed comparable
vertex similarity measures predicating on the idea that vertices are similar if their neighbors are similar. In social
network analysis, Katz centrality [9] of a vertex equals to the sum of that vertex’s similarities to every other vertex
and is computed by taking into account the total number of walks between a pair of vertices. In computer science,
Jeh and Widom [10] have proposed a method that they call “SimRank,” implementing a recursive deﬁnition of
object similarity: two objects are similar if they relate to similar objects. SimRank similarity of two nodes i and j
has an elegant random walk interpretation as the probability that two independent simultaneous random walkers,
beginning at i and j, will eventually meet at some node. In physics, another similar concept which led to a self-
consistent matrix formulation of similarity that can be evaluated iteratively using only the knowledge of the graph
adjacency matrix is proposed by Newman and co-workers [11].

Here we measure structural similarity between vertices on directed network by considering directed graphlets
(induced sub-graphs) associated with vertices, and, subsequently probe the structure of graphs by computing cor-
relations of the frequencies of different graphlets present in the graph. Let G = (V, E) be a simple directed (un-
weighted) graph and let A = [aij] be its n×n adjacency matrix, where n is the number of vertices, such that aii = 0
(self-arcs are excluded). For an element of the edge set E we write (i, j) to denote i → j. A graphlet Gk = (Vk, Ek)
is an induced sub-graph that consists of a subset of k vertices of the graph G = (V, E) (i.e., Vk ⊂ V ) together with
all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset (i.e., Ek = {e ∈ E : e = (u, v) and u, v ∈ Vk}). Therefore,
graphlets are small induced sub-graphs of a large network that appear at any frequency and hence are independent
of a null model. Here, we consider only weakly connected graphlets.

Graphlets have found numerous applications as building blocks of network analysis in various disciplines rang-
ing from social science [12, 13] to biology [14, 15, 16, 2]. In social science, graphlet analysis (known as sub-graph
census) is widely adopted in sociometric studies [12]. Much of the work in this vein focused on analyzing triadic
tendencies as important structural features of social networks (e.g., transitivity or triadic closure) as well as ana-
lyzing triadic conﬁgurations as the basis for various social network theories (e.g., social balance, strength of weak
ties, stability of ties, or trust [18]). Directed graphs are treated as having two different types of edges: directed
and reciprocal. The research on reciprocal edges originates with the triad census work of Holland and Leinhardt
[12]. A reciprocal edge is technically a pair of directed edges, {(i, j), (j, i)}, that we treat as a single recipro-
cal edge. We deﬁne the set of in-neighbors S−
i = {j : (j, i) ∈ E and (i, j) /∈ E}, the set of out-neighbors
i = {j : (i, j) ∈ E and (j, i) /∈ E}, and the set of reciprocal-neighbors S◦
S+
For a node i of network G, the automorphism orbit of i is the set of nodes of G that can be mapped to i by an
automorphism, an isomorphism of a network with itself; i.e., a bijection of nodes that preserves node adjacency.
Automorphism orbits have been used to generalize the graph degree distribution [16, 2]. Given a family of graphlets
of size k nodes, 2 ≤ k ≤ 4, one can count the number of times a node is touched by an orbit. In directed graphs there
are 1695 orbits for up to 4-node graphlets, see SI. The larger number of such orbits makes a complete enumeration
unattractive, a problem which continues to worsen for larger graphlets. Therefore, here we restrict ourselves to
working with 3-node graphlets, reducing the number of orbits to 48. In addition, we further reduce it to 16 orbits
by considering only isomorphism triangle and wedge classes starting at vertex i (see SI).

i = {j : (i, j) ∈ E and (j, i) ∈ E}.

Triangle is a set of three nodes, each of which is connected to the other two. Let T = (Vt, Et) be a triangle
with nodes i, h, j and edges e1, e2, e3 between nodes i and h, h and j, and i and j respectively. We equip the edges
with an arbitrary orientation, as this is necessary for the further analysis. To be speciﬁc, we assume that directed
or reciprocal character of the edges between i and h and i and j are considered with respect of the node i and of
the edge between h and j with respect of the node j. Thus, for example, we write (+,−,◦) triangle to denote the
triangle T = (Vt, Et) with Vt = {i, h, j} and Et = {i → h, h → j, i ↔ j}. More generally we write (α, β, γ)
triangle to denote one of the triangle types, where α, β, γ = {◦, +,−}. In a similar fashion we denote (α, β)
wedges for the wedges in directed graphs. Since directed graphs have two types of edges: directed and reciprocal,
there exist 9 wedge types, which are arranged in 6 isomorphism wedge classes (Figure 1a), and 27 triangle types,
which can be grouped in 7 isomorphism triangle classes (Figure 1b). Finally, the 2-node graphlets orbits originating
at a node i are equivalent to the out-links, in-links and reciprocal links of node i.

The number of (α, β, γ) triangles starting at i is given by:

j | is the
where the entries aα, aβ, aγ of the graph adjacency matrix are provided in Figure 1c. Indeed, |Sα
number of the common α-neighbors of i and β-neighbors of j. Summarizing |Sα
j | for all j that are γ-neighbors
of i, one computes the number of (α, β, γ) triangles. The number of of (α, β) wedges starting at vertex i is
L(α,β)
γ T (α,β,γ)
.
Therefore 39 quantities dα
are associated with a vertex i. This number is further reduced
to 16 by considering only isomorphic wedge and triangle classes (SI). We deﬁne signature/feature vector of a vertex
i as Fi = [di, Wi, Ti]T where:

gree of the vertex, while Wi and Ti, called wedge-degree and triangle-degree, respectively, are the number of 3-node
graphlets starting at i. Signature vectors describe only local connectivity of directed edges. Indeed, by ﬂipping

is labeled i (wedge/triangle starts at i). Assuming that directed (and reciprocal) edges are considered with respect
to particular vertex in the wedge or the triangle (see the main text), each wedge and triangle can be labeled as
(α, β) and (α, β, γ), respectively, where α, β, γ ∈ {+,−,◦}. Hence, there are 9 wedges and 27 triangles starting
at i, which are clustered in 6 wedge isomorphic classes (a) and 7 triangle isomorphic classes (b). (c) Entries of

the direction of edges between all connected pairs of nodes with probability one-third (for out-,in-, and reciprocal-
edges), which keeps the undirected connectivity and thus the edge density unchanged, the information about the
direction of edges will be destroyed and normalized signature vectors will converge to [ 1
7 ]T
(see SI).
For each vertex in a network, we construct its signature vector consisting of 16 coordinates corresponding
to the number of 16 graphlets starting at the vertex. Then we construct an N × 16 matrix whose rows are the
signature vectors for each vertex. For a given network G, we compute Pearson correlation coefﬁcients between
all pairs of columns of the above described matrix and present them in a 16 × 16 symmetric matrix that is termed
[2] graphlet correlation matrix of network G. In this way, the network topology and its local direction patters,
regardless network size (the number of vertices) and network volume (the number of edges), are summarized into
a 16 × 16 matrix.

Different networks generally have very different graphlet dependencies and hence reveal unknown organiza-
tional principles of real-world networks. We study effective brain networks of 40 healthy subjects (see supplemen-
tary information). Brain connectivity refers to a pattern of anatomical links (“anatomical connectivity”), of statis-
tical dependencies (“functional connectivity”) or of causal interactions (“effective connectivity”) between distinct

The dataset represents effective connectivity of the brain network,
describing a network of directional effects of one neural region over another. (a) 116 regions (vertices) are consid-
ered in total (shown on the vertical axis); a directed edge represents causality of one region (vertex) over another.
Each region is represented by 16-dimensional feature vector (shown on horizontal axis). Ward agglomerative hi-
erarchical clustering procedure results in a heat-map representing clustered regions. Three clusters with similar
local structure are easily indentiﬁed. (b) Two regions from the same cluster are shown, both having similar local
structure; only for better visualization, sub-graph with 64 nodes is shown on which the local structures around two
(similar) vertices are shown. (c) Graphlet correlation matrix of a particular brain network is shown, only those

abcunits – region of interests (ROI) – within a nervous system [19]. Here, effective brain connectivity is studied using
Granger (G-) causality. Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST) is used and multivariate-coefﬁcients
ROI-wise G - causality analysis (GCA) is adopted to generate effective networks. REST-GCA supports signed-
path coefﬁcients multivariate GCA and integrates a batch mode coefﬁcients computation for ROI-wise GCA [20].
For each network the number of vertices (regions) is equal to 116, while the total number of edges in the networks
(after pruning) is 3466 ± 43. We construct a matrix such that the number of rows in the matrix is equal to the
number of vertices in the network and the number of columns equals the dimension of the signature vector (the
matrix has 16 columns), see Figure 2a. The signature vector represents the local structure around the vertex and
can be employed to understand organizational rules within a network and to reveal structural differences between
networks. We also compute correlation coefﬁcients between all pairs of columns of this matrix and present them in
a 16 × 16 symmetric matrix, Figure 2c.

Figure 3: Graphlet correlation matrices are computed for all 40 healthy subjects. Percentages of the healthy subjects
that have statistically signiﬁcant are colored. The correlation is considered signiﬁcant if the Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient is greater than 0.7 and for anti-correlation is signiﬁcant if the coefﬁcient is less than −0.7. The heat-
map indicates that there are many pairs of entries of the signature vector that are signiﬁcantly correlated or anti-
correlated for most of the subjects.

We then compute the percentage of subjects for which particular coordinates (similarity metrics) of the signature
vectors are signiﬁcantly correlated (> 0.7) or anti-correlated (< −0.7), Figure 3. We found that for brain effective
networks higher values of the number of out-degree is associated (signiﬁcantly anti-correlated) with lower values
of the number if in-degree in 95% subjects and with the number of reciprocal-degree in 64% subjects. Therefore,
regions which are involved in activations (G-causes) of other regions (higher values of G-causes manifested with
higher values of d+) at the same time are not activate (G-effects) by other regions (lower values of G-effects
shown in both d− and d◦). On the other hand, the number of in-degree and the number of reciprocal-degree are
correlated in 62% subjects. Moreover, we found that W (path) is anti-correlated with T (out+) (in 74% subjects),
T (cycle++) (in 85% subjects) and with T (rec) (in 79% subjects). The number of in-wedges W (in) is anti-correlated

5

with W (out+) (in 74% subjects), T (in+) (in 79% subjects), ), T (cycle++) (in 85% subjects) and with T (rec) (in
74% subjects). While the relationships between degrees, wedge-degrees, and wedge-degrees and triangle-degrees
are mostly negative (anti-correlated), we found that relationships between different number of triangles (involving
reciprocal edges) are positive (correlated): (1) T (out+) with T (in+) (69%), T (cycle++) (100%), T (rec) (97%); (2)
T (cycle+) with T (in+) (59%); (3) T (in+) with T (cycle++) (100%) and T (rec) (59%); (4) T (cycle++) with T (rec)
(100%). However, no signiﬁcant (positive or negative) relationships are found in which the number of acyclic
triangles and the number of cycle triangles are involved.

In conclusion vertex signature vector and graphlet correlation matrix are powerful tools for network analysis.
We found that the graphlet correlation matrix of the brain effective network has positive correlation between various
triangle-degrees only if at least one edge is reciprocal. Negative correlation was pronounced when comparing out-
degrees with in-degrees and reciprocal-degrees, as well as, when comparing degrees with wedge-degrees. How
this ﬁnding will further enhance our understanding of brain connectivity will be a subject of our future research
activities.

After submitting this paper we learned that Przulj’s group was working on similar problem using different

approach and data [21].

1 Graphlet-based similarity

In undirected graphs, there are eight 2- to 4-node graphlets resulting in 15 orbits [2] (of which 11 are non-redundant
[2]), that touch a vertex i. Since the number of up to 4-mode graphlets in directed networks is large, here we
consider only a subset of these orbits starting (originating) from a vertex. More speciﬁcally, let h1, ...hk, be nodes
belonging to graphlets with 2 ≤ k ≤ 4 nodes and deﬁne α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, α6 ∈ {+,−,◦}. We enumerate all
possible ways in which an orbit can touch the node h1 in these directed graphlets:

By ﬂipping the direction of edges between all connected pairs of nodes with probability one-third (for out-,in-, and
reciprocal-edges), which keeps the undirected connectivity and the edge density unchanged, information about the
direction of edges will be destroyed and normalized signature vectors should be close to [ 1
7 ]T .
This could be further exploited by studying normalized signature vectors for different real-world networks and
their distances to random directed network with no direction-generated structure (such graph could be generated by
considering arbitrary undirected connected graph and then transforming it to directed graph by assigning to each
edge of the graph a direction (out, in, or reciprocal) with probability 1/3).

The number of triangles (but also wedges) could also be normalized as follows. ti(α, β, γ) is the normalized

h xαxβ is the number of all (α, β) wedges starting at i. Thus, ti(α, β, γ) indicates the
ratio of (α, β) wedges that are (α, β, γ) triangles. This is a generalization of the concept of clustering coefﬁcient
of a graph to clustering coefﬁcient of (α, β, γ) triangle associated to the node i:

2 Effective brain networks
2.1 Data description
The effective brain networks were extracted from the rs - fMRI images of a group of healthy subjects and were
taken from the Beijing Enhanced data set for multimodal brain images [3]. In this study, a total of 40 healthy
subjects were used, aged from 18 to 26 years. The fMRI scans were taken during resting state of the subject, with
a SIMENS Trio Tim scanner (whose strength of magnetics ﬁeld of 3 Tesla, and EPI sequence). The following
parameters of the EPI sequence were used: repetition (TR) / time echo (TE) = 2000 / 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 90, ﬁeld
of view (FOV) = 200× 200mm2, voxel dimension = 3× 3× 3mm3, number of slices = 240. For preprocessing the
fMRI data the DPARSF toolbox [4] was used. First, the images of each subject were corrected for slice timing and
realigned (motion corrected). Then the images were normalized using the MNI EPI template with afﬁne registration
followed by nonlinear transformation. After, smoothing was applied using a Gaussian Kernel of 4mm Full Width at
Half Maximum and the signal was detrended to remove any noise that may have remained from the previous steps.
Finally, the data were ﬁltered to preserve low frequency ﬂuctuations (0.01 − 0.08 Hz). The effective connectivity
for each subject were reconstructed using Granger causality coefﬁcient between the time series of 116 regions of
interest (ROIs). After obtaining effective connectivity for each subject, the week connections from the effective
connectivity network were pruned using threshold value, independently for each subject using. Using a pruning
threshold must meet the following two criteria [5, 6, 7] : (i) 99 percent of the vertices (regions) are connected after
pruning and (ii) the minimum degree of each vertex is at least 2 × ln(N ), where N is the number of nodes in the
network according to Network based statatistic toolbox [8].

2.2 Graphlet correlation matrix
Here graphlet correlation matrices are provided for all 40 healthy subjects (Figure 1 to Figure 7).
