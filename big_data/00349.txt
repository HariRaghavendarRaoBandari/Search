Abstract

The majority of cancer-related fatalities are due to metastatic disease [17].

In chemora-
diotherapy, chemotherapeutic agents are administered along with radiation to increase damage
to the primary tumor and control systemic disease such as metastasis. This work introduces
a mathematical model to obtain optimal drug and radiation protocols in a chemoradiother-
apy scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing metastatic cancer cell populations at
multiple potential sites while maintaining a minimum level of damage to the primary tumor
site. We derive closed-form expressions for an optimal chemotherapy fractionation regimen. A
dynamic programming framework is used to determine the optimal radiotherapy fractionation
regimen. Results show that chemotherapeutic agents do not change the optimal radiation frac-
tionation regimens, and vice-versa. Interestingly, we observe that regardless of radio-sensitivity
parameters, hypo-fractionated schedules are optimal solutions for the radiotherapy fractionation
problem. Furthermore, it is optimal to immediately start radiotherapy. However, for chemother-
apy, we ﬁnd that the structure of the optimal schedule depends on model parameters such as
chemotherapy-induced cell-kill at primary and metastatic sites, as well as the ability of primary
tumor cells to initiate successful metastasis at diﬀerent body sites. We quantify the trade-oﬀ
between the new and traditional objectives of minimizing the metastatic population size and
maximizing the tumor control probability, respectively, for a cervical cancer case. The trade-oﬀ
information indicates the potential for signiﬁcant reduction in the metastatic population with
minimal loss in primary tumor control.

1 Introduction

Metastasis occurs when cancer cells spread from the location of a primary tumor to anatomically
distant locations. The process of cancer metastasis consists of the following steps: tumor cells detach
from the primary tumor site, invade a blood or lymphatic vessel, transit in the bloodstream, and
extravasate from the blood vessels to distant sites where they proliferate to form new colonies. It
is thought that cancer cells evolve a special set of traits that improve their ability to carry out this
process [9]. Single or multi-site metastasis is a common occurrence in cancer patients. For instance,
bone metastasis occurs in up to 70% of patients with advanced prostrate or breast cancer [35], or
20% of patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix develop single (32%) or multi-site (68%)
metastasis at distant locations such as lymph nodes, lung, bone, or abdomen [8]. The development

1

of metastases signiﬁcantly lessens the chances of successful therapy and represents a major cause
of mortality in cancer patients. For instance, only 20% of patients with breast cancer [35] and
less than 1% of patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix [8] are still alive ﬁve years after the
discovery of metastasis.

Many researchers have used mathematical modeling and various optimization techniques to ﬁnd
clinically relevant optimal radiation delivery schedules. The mathematical building block for the
majority of radiotherapy response modeling is the linear-quadratic (LQ) model [19]. This model
states that following exposure to d Gy of radiation, the surviving fraction of tumor cells is given by
e−αd−βd2, where α and β are cell-speciﬁc parameters. In a conventional radiotherapy fractionation
problem, the goal is to maximize the biological eﬀect of radiation on the tumor while inﬂicting the
least amount of healthy-tissue damage, which are evaluated using tumor control probability (TCP)
and normal-tissue complication probability (NTCP), respectively [44]. Some important questions
concern the best total treatment size, the best way to divide the total dose into fractional doses, and
the optimal inter-fraction interval times. An important result emerging from recent work is that
for low values of tumor [α/β], a hypo-fractionated schedule, where large fraction sizes are delivered
over a small number of treatment days, is optimal. However for large values of [α/β], a hyper-
fractionated schedule, where small fraction sizes are delivered over a large number of treatment
days, is optimal [29, 4, 2, 5].

For many inoperable tumors, radiotherapy alone is not enough to successfully control the pri-
mary tumor. For these tumors, chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care, in which one or several
chemotherapeutic agents are administered along with radiation. There are at least two basic mech-
anisms by which the combination of the two modalities may result in a therapeutic gain. First,
chemotherapy may be eﬀective against (occult) systemic disease, such as metastasis. This mecha-
nism is called spatial cooperation. Second, the two modalities act independently (so-called additiv-
ity) or dependently (so-called radio-sensitization) to enhance tumor cell-kill at the primary site [40].
Recently, Salari et al. [37] studied changes in optimal radiation fractionation regimens that result
from adding chemotherapeutic agents to radiotherapy when maximizing TCP. More speciﬁcally,
they incorporated additivity and radio-sensitization mechanisms into the radiation fractionation
decision to identify corresponding changes in optimal radiation fractionation schemes. Their re-
sults suggest that chemotherapeutic agents with only an additive eﬀect do not impact optimal
radiation fractionation schemes; however, radio-sensitizers may change the optimal fractionation
schemes and in particular may give rise to optimal nonstationary schemes.

In our very recent work [3], we introduced a novel biologically driven objective function that
takes into account metastatic risk instead of maximizing TCP. We observed that when design-
ing optimal radiotherapy treatments with the goal of minimizing metastatic production, hypo-
fractionation is preferable for many parameter choices, and standard fractionation is only preferable
when the [α/β] value of the tumor is suﬃciently large and the long-term metastasis risk (several
years after therapy) is considered.

Our prior results [3] demonstrated a proof of concept that radiation scheduling decisions have
the potential to signiﬁcantly impact metastatic risk. However, that work left out several important
features in the modeling of advanced carcinomas. First, we only considered single-site metastatic
disease. However, it is well known that some tumors, e.g., lung cancers, metastasize quickly to
multiple sites, whereas others, such as breast and prostate carcinomas, often take years to de-
velop metastatic colonies and then only in a relatively limited number of sites [22]. Importantly,
metastatic colonies at diﬀerent anatomical sites may respond diﬀerently to anti-cancer drugs or
have drastically diﬀerent growth kinetics. Another shortcoming of the previous work [3] was that

2

the mathmatical model ignored the growth of tumors at metastatic sites. In particular, [3] only
looked at metastatic risk, which was measured by the total number of successful metastatic cells
produced, and thus treated all successful metastatic cells equally, regardless of what point in time
they initiated metastatic lesions. However, a more accurate model of the clinical situation allows
for the metastatic cells to reproduce in their new location [9]. Incorporating this important phe-
nomenon now means that metastatic sites that are initiated earlier are much more dangerous than
metastatic lesions initiated late in the course of the disease. Finally, our prior work [3] focused
solely on radiotherapy. However, when studying the evolution of metastatic disease under treat-
ment, the role of chemotherapy is clearly paramount, given its systemic nature. This has been
born out in clinical trials where it has been observed that concurrent chemoradiotherapy reduces
the risk of distant metastasis compared to radiotherapy alone (e.g., see [43, 27]). In the current
work, we address these shortcomings by developing a mathematical model that allows for multi-site
metastatic disease with possible growth at each location, and include systemic chemotherapy as a
possible treatment.

In this work, we consider the problem of ﬁnding optimal radiotherapy dosing and a chemother-
apy regimen that minimizes the total expected number of metastatic tumor cells at multiple body
sites while keeping normal-tissue damage below clinically acceptable levels. To study the trade-oﬀ
between the conventional objective, maximizing TCP, and our novel approach of minimizing the
metastatic population, we consider an additional constraint requiring the tumor damage associated
with the optimal regimen to exceed a user-speciﬁed percentage of that of conventional regimens.
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the ﬁrst to address optimal chemoradiotherapy
fractionation in the context of targeting multi-site metastatic disease and primary tumor control.
We examine the mathematical properties of the optimal fractionation scheme in the context of
cervical tumors.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss a model for multi-
site metastasis production and how it can be used to develop a function that reﬂects metastatic
production at diﬀerent body locations. In Section 3, we formulate an optimization model for the
chemoradiotherapy fractionation problem, derive some mathematical results regarding the proper-
ties of optimal regimens, and develop a dynamic programming solution approach. In Section 4, we
present numerical results in the situation of cervical cancer. Finally, we summarize and conclude
the paper in Section 5.

2 Mathematical model of treatment and metastasis development

Consider a treatment regimen in which a radiation dose of di and a drug concentration of ci are
administered at treatment fraction i = 1, . . . , N . Our objective is to minimize total metastatic cell
population produced by the primary tumor at n diﬀerent sites within a patient’s body at time T ,
where the time horizon T consists of treatment days and a potentially long period of no treatment,
at the end of which total metastatic population is evaluated. We consider a suﬃciently large N to
include all three possible chemoradiotherapy regimens, which are neoadjuvant, concurrent, or adju-
vant, depending on whether, in the optimal solution, the chemotherapeutic agents are administered
before, during, or after the course of radiotherapy, respectively.

We start by assuming that the total population of primary tumor cells at time t is large enough
and that we can approximate it by a deterministic function Xt. To formulate the total population
of primary tumor cells at time t, we adopt the common approach used in most studies, i.e., survival
curves of irradiated cell lines follow a linear-quadratic ﬁt on a logarithmic scale (see [19] for a

3

discussion of the linear-quadratic model), and survival curves of cell lines that are exposed to
chemotherapeutic agents have an exponential form in terms of the drug’s concentration [39]. Taking
both models into account, we can compute the number of tumor cells at time t ∈ [0, T ] by (2.1):

where X0 is the initial tumor population, α and β are tumor radio-sensitivity parameters, θ is
the tissue-speciﬁc parameter associated with chemotherapy additive eﬀect, Tk is the tumor kick-oﬀ
time, and τd shows the tumor doubling time in units of days (see [33] and [11] for sources).

The choice of tumor growth function is strongly driven by the size of cancer being modeled.
Exponential growth is a good model for small-size tumors. However, limitations of the availability
of nutrients, oxygen, and space imply that exponential growth is not appropriate for the long-
term growth of solid tumors, so we must consider alternative formulations such as Gompertz or
logistic models. The current view of tumor-growth kinetics during therapy is based on the general
assumption that tumor cells grow exponentially due to the small population [19]. Here, we also
assume that the tumor is small enough and that it grows exponentially with a time lag during the
course of the treatment. In particular, we are interested in the long-term metastatic risk associated
with a chemoradiotherapy regimen evaluated at any time point between the conclusion of therapy
and the local recurrence, i.e., T < min{t > 0|Xt = X0}. During this time period, the primary
tumor has not yet reached a clinically detectable size again and thus is suﬃciently small in order
to use the exponential function in (2.1) to ﬁt the growth of the tumor cell population.

The notion of biologically equivalent dose (BED), originally motivated by the LQ model, is used
in clinical practice to quantify the biological damage caused by a radiation fractionation scheme in
a given structure. More speciﬁcally, the BED for a fractionation regimen with n treatment fractions
in which radiation dose di is administered in fraction i (i = 1, . . . , n) is given by

(cid:18)

n(cid:88)

i=1

(cid:19)

di

[α/β]

BED =

1 +

(2.2)

where [α/β] is a structure-speciﬁc radio-sensitivity parameter. Several clinical studies have asso-
ciated diﬀerent BED values, independent of the number of fractions and the radiation dose per
fraction di (i = 1, . . . , n), to TCP and NTCP values calculated, based on clinical data [13].

Metastasis is the process by which the primary tumor cells detach from the tumor, invade
the circulatory or lymph system, and colonize other parts of the body. To model the metastatic
formation and growth process, we assume that a fraction of the primary tumor cells are capable of
producing successful metastatic cells and that these cells do so at rate ν. This fraction is dictated
by the fractal dimension of the blood vessels inﬁltrating the tumor, which we denote by ξ ∈ [0, 1],
(see [23]). For example, if we assume that the tumor is roughly spherical and all cells on the
surface are capable of metastasis, then we would take ξ = 2/3; however, if we assume only the cells
along the boundary of a one-dimensional blood vessel are capable of metastasis, then we would set
ξ = 1/3 (see [21] for a more detailed discussion and estimation of this parameter). To summarize,
we assume that metastatic cells are produced according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process with
intensity function at time t given by νX ξ
t . Furthermore, we assume that each successful metastatic
cell, independent of other metastatic cells, initiates a metastatic colony at site i (i = 1, . . . , n) with
i=1 pi = 1) and that the probability of secondary metastasis, which is the formation
of new metastasis originating in other metastatic colonies, is negligible. Therefore, thinning our

probability pi ((cid:80)n

4

original Poisson process tells us that metastasis formation at site i follows a non-homogeneous
Poison process with rate bi(t) = piνX ξ
t .

We model the growth of each metastatic lesion using a non-homogeneous branching process with
a rate dependent on time t and the metastasis site. More speciﬁcally, the birth and death rates at
site i (i = 1, . . . , n) are denoted by ui(t) and vi(t), respectively. This is similar to the modeling
approach taken in [18], which used multi-type branching processes to study metastasis and then
applied the work to study pancreatic cancer data, thus ﬁtting the model to metastasis data from
patients. We consider the growth rate of metastatic cells µi(t) = ui(t) − vi(t) in the absence of
chemotherapeutic agents as a positive value that is constant with respect to time (µi(t) = µi).
During chemotherapy, we assume that the growth rate of metastatic cells decreases linearly as
a function of the magnitude of the last dose of chemotherapy drug administrated [30]. Written
mathematically we have

where ωi is a positive constant, depending on heterogeneity in drug concentrations among diﬀerent
sites and sensitivity of tumor cells to the chemotherapy at ith site.

If we have a total evaluation horizon of time T , then the expected number of total metastatic

cells at site i is given by the convolution (see [12])

is diﬃcult to estimate the total life history of a tumor prior to diagnosis. In addition our model is
primarily intended for locally advanced cancer cases, whereas metastasis formation typically occurs
in later stages of the disease once the tumor has reached a signiﬁcantly large size [20].

The objective function evaluates the cumulative metastasis production divided by ν at time T
at n diﬀerent body organs over all treatment fractions. Constraints (3.9) and (3.11) are toxicity
constraints associated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, respectively. More speciﬁcally, we use
the BED model in (2.2) to constrain the radiation side eﬀects in the surrounding healthy structures
around the tumor [19]. In doing so, we assume that there are M healthy tissues in the vicinity of
the tumor, and a dose d results in a homogeneous dose γjd in the jth normal tissue, where γj is the
sparing factor. Parameter [α/β]j represents the BED parameter, and BEDj speciﬁes the maximum
BED allowed in the jth healthy tissue. We limit the maximum cumulative chemotherapy dose
by Cmax, which is the total amount of a drug that can be delivered to a patient over the period
of treatment, measured in milligrams/meter squared [28]. Inequalities (3.12) and (3.13) limit the
maximum allowable daily radiation dose and chemotherapy drug concentration, respectively, where
dmax and cmax show the maximum tolerable dose, measured in Gy and milligrams/meter squared,
respectively, that can be delivered in a single day [28].
Finally, constraint (3.10) guarantees that tumor BED imposed by the optimal schedule is greater
than or equal to f × 100 percent of the tumor BED realized by the standard schedule. Note that
TCP is an increasing function of tumor BED for a homogeneous radiation dose, and thus TCP and
tumor BED maximization are equivalent. The parameter 0 ≤ f ≤ 1 is an input to our model and
characterizes the trade-oﬀ between maximizing TCP and minimizing metastatic cells population
(see, e.g., [10] for a review of optimization methods to characterize the trade-oﬀ between the two
objectives). If we assume that the primary cause of cancer-related death in a speciﬁc tumor (e.g.
pancreatic or cervical cancer) is metastatic dissemination, then we choose a low value of f , e.g.,
70%. However, if the primary tumor may cause patient death (e.g., lung cancer), then a high value
of f will be taken, e.g., 98%.

Formulation (3.8)–(3.13) is a nonconvex quadratically constrained program. Such problems are
computationally diﬃcult to solve in general. In the rest of this section, we ﬁrst derive some math-
ematical results regarding the structure of the optimal solution of (3.8)–(3.13) and then develop a
dynamic programming algorithm to solve the problem.

We start by discussing an important property of the optimal chemotherapy dose vector.

Lemma 1. Let the optimal drug vector of problem (3.8)–(3.13) be (cid:126)c∗ = {c∗

The proof is in Appendix A. Lemma 1 states that any optimal solution to (3.8)–(3.13) yields a
chemotherapy regimen with the maximum dose allowed. By using the result of Lemma 1, we can
rewrite function f ((cid:126)d, (cid:126)c) as

The proof is in Appendix B. In Lemma 2, we specify the general structure of the optimal
chemoradiotherapy regimen. In the following result, we ﬁnd the optimal chemotherapy drug vector
for two special cases.
Theorem 1. Let the optimal drug vector of problem (3.8)–(3.13) be (cid:126)c∗ = {c∗

The proof is in Appendix C. The following three important observations are made for optimal
treatment regimens associated with chemoradiotherapy based on the results of Lemma 2 and The-
orem 1. Note that in the following, we use the fact that in the traditional optimal fractionation
problem where one is interested in minimizing local tumor population (or maximizing TCP) at the
end of treatment, the ordering of d∗

i does not aﬀect the TCP (see [37] and [2]).

i and c∗

Remark 1. The non-increasing order of the optimal radiation dose vector obtained in Lemma 2
suggests that it is always optimal to immediately start the radiotherapy treatment. Furthermore, it
is optimal to immediately initiate chemotherapy if θξ ≥ maxi=1,...,n ωi, or to postpone chemother-
apy until the end of the treatment if θξ < mini=1,...,n ωi, suggesting a concurrent and adjuvant
chemoradiotherapy regimen, respectively. Hence, Lemma 2 tells us that it is never optimal to use
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimens, which is consistent with clinical observations [16](see
conclusion for more discussion).

Remark 2. The resulting radiotherapy fractionation schedules for minimizing total metastatic
cancer cells suggest a non-increasing radiation fractionated structure, which is due to the structure
of the model. Metastatic cells initiated at distant locations are not killed by radiotherapy doses.
Thus, in order to minimize the metastatic cell population using radiation, it is necessary to quickly
reduce the primary tumor cell population since this is the source of metastatic lesions. Also, note
that given the growth of metastatic lesions, we are particularly concerned with metastatic lesions
created early in the course of therapy.

Remark 3. The resulting chemotherapy fractionation schedules for minimizing total metastatic
cancer cells suggest a hypo-fractionated structure concentrated at the beginning or the end of the
schedule. This is due to the fact that if the combined eﬀect (θξ) of chemotherapy-induced cell-
kill (θ) and the fraction of cells capable of metastasis in the primary tumor (ξ) is larger than the
chemotherapy-induced metastatic cell-kill at all distant locations (maxi=1,...,n{ωi}), then we consider
the primary tumor cell population as dangerous, due to the inability of chemotherapy to control

8

the metastatic cell populations. Hence, it is preferable to target the primary tumor and reduce
its size as quickly as possible. However, if the eﬀect of the chemotherapeutic agents on all distant
metastatic sites (mini=1,...,n{ωi}) is larger than the product of chemotherapy-induced cell-kill (θ) and
the fraction of cells that are capable of metastasis in the primary tumor (ξ), then we consider that
the chemotherapeutic agents are more eﬀective in controlling metastatic disease than the primary
tumor control. Hence, we prefer to administer chemotherapy at the end of treatment when we can
target the accumulated metastatic cells.

Finally, we establish a result that describes the closed-form solution of the optimal radiotherapy
schedule for a special case where β = 0 and [α/β]j → ∞ (j = 1, . . . , M ), which implies the use of
linear log-survival, rather than LQ, and physical dose, rather than BED, to describe tumor cell-kill
and normal-tissue toxicity, respectively. This case is motivated by the fact that tissue response to
small radiation doses is dominated by the linear term [36, 1], which is applicable to our model when
dmax is suﬃciently small (around 2 Gy [31]).

Proposition 1. If we assume that radiation-induced tumor cell-kill has a linear form, i.e., β = 0
and radiation-induced toxicity in normal tissue j (j = 1, . . . , M ) is evaluated using the physical
dose, i.e., [α/β]j → ∞, then the optimal radiotherapy schedule is given by d∗

3 for the case of θξ ≥ maxi=1,...,n ωi can be implemented to derive the optimal dose vector.

If it is possible to apply Theorem 1, then we immediately know the optimal chemotherapy
concentrations. It then remains to ﬁnd the optimal radiation doses, which can be determined using
dynamic programming, similar to our work in [3]. The states of the system required to decide
the dose dt are Ut and Vt, which Ut and Vt are the cumulative dose and cumulative dose squared
delivered to the tumor immediately after time t, respectively. We can update states of the system
by

Ut = Ut−1 + dt
Vt = Vt−1 + d2

Using the functions introduced in (3.7) and (3.14), the forward recursion of our dynamic program-
ming algorithm can be written as

In both cases, since there are two or three state variables, we can solve our optimization problem
by discretizing the states and using the dynamic programming algorithm.

4 Numerical results

In this section, we apply our methods in the optimization of a chemoradiotherapy regimen for
locally advanced cervical tumors. We consider the toxicity eﬀects of radiotherapy in three diﬀerent
normal tissues: bladder, small intestine, and rectum [34], using the BED model introduced in (2.2).
A standard fractionated treatment for cervical cancer is to deliver 45 Gy to the tumor over ﬁve
weeks (25 working days). The maximum tolerated doses for each normal tissue are computed based
on the standard fractionation scheme (1.8 Gy × 25).

Treatment days comprise a course of external beam radiotherapy and chemotherapy administra-
tion, followed by a short rest period lasting Nr days, and low-dose-rate brachytherapy with a dose
rate of R Gy per day delivered within Nb days, respectively. The treatment sequence is motivated
by combined-modality treatment protocols for cervical cancer used in clinical practice that often
involve adjuvant brachytherapy. Equation (2.1) is adjusted in the presence of brachytherapy as
(4.15) (see [33] for the adjusted formulation in the presence of brachytherapy):

where σ is the monoexponential repair rate of sublethal damage [33] and eg represents the eﬀects
of the dose gradients around the brachytherapy sources (see [33] and [11]). We assume low-dose
brachytherapy is performed in two days within one week after the completion of pelvic external
radiotherapy [33]. Note that this assumption does not aﬀect the optimal solution, and our result
still applies to diﬀerent brachytherapy schedules.

The standard radiosensitizer agent used in locally advanced cervical tumors is Cisplatin, given
at low daily doses, and the standard chemotherapy agent is Fluorouracil (5-FU), given at high daily
doses, [25, 43]. We assume Cisplatin delivered at low doses augments the eﬀects of radiotherapy by
sensitizing tumor cells to radiation [7, 41], which can be modeled as an increase in the linear term of
the LQ model without any signiﬁcant change in the quadratic term [14]. Hence, the LQ parameter α
in (4.15) is substituted with α+κccis, where ccis shows the average daily dose of Cisplatin. Cisplatin
is usually administered intravenously at a dose of 40 mg per square meter of body-surface area per
week (mg/m2) [25], therefore we set ccis = 8 mg/m2. Note that Cisplatin is given at low doses;
hence, its resulting independent cell-kill is negligible. The agent 5-FU administrated at high doses
is considered to have an inherent cytotoxic activity and acts as a systemic therapeutic agent [38].
The standard chemotherapy protocol for delivering 5-FU concurrently with radiotherapy consists
of administrating a dose of 1, 000 mg/m2 per day for 8 days [32]. Hence, we set the maximum daily
dose of 5-FU to be cmax = 1, 000 mg/m2 and the total dose to be Cmax = 8, 000 mg/m2.

We set N to be 25 days (ﬁve weeks, considering weekends as breaks) since 5-FU is given
concurrently with radiotherapy. We employ the calibration method discussed in [33] to estimate the
value of κ and θ associated with the radiosensitizer (Cisplatin) and chemotherapeutic agent (5-FU),
respectively, from clinical trial studies. In particular, to estimate the κ and θ values, we compare
the progression-free survival rates reported in [25] (radiotherapy vs radiotherapy+Cisplatin) and
[32] (radiotherapy vs radiotherapy+Cisplatin+5-FU), respectively, among patients treated with
radiotherapy alone and those who were treated with chemoradiotherapy, which are denoted by
TCPr and TCPcr, respectively. This yields the following estimation for parameter κ and θ (see [33]
for more details):

κ = − ln(ln(TCPcr)/ ln(TCPr))

Note that in the above equations we use diﬀerent values of ccis, TCPr, and TCPcr, as reported in
[25] and [32], to estimate κ and θ, respectively. All of the tumor and normal tissue parameters are
summarized in Table 1. Note that to fully explore how the structure of the optimal solution relates
to the optimal conventional fractionation regimes in diﬀerent scenarios, we consider a wide range
of values for the parameter [α/β]. There is a signiﬁcant amount of debate as to whether or not the
linear quadratic model applies to large doses [26, 6]. In view of this, we set dmax to be 5 Gy.

τd

Distribution of the most common sites of cervical cancer metastases is outlined in Table 2 (see
[8]). Metastases often grow at the same rate as the primary tumor [15]; hence, it is natural to
assume µ1 = ··· = µn = ln 2
. Although distant metastases may appear any time after treatment,
approximately 88% of multi-organ metastases in cervical cancer occur within three years of the
conclusion of treatment [8]. Hence, we set parameter T to three years. Parameter ωi represents the
reduction in metastatic cell growth rate at site i in relation to the chemotherapy dose administrated
and has a unit of mg/m2 per day. There is a lack of reliable clinical data on the rate of chemotherapy-
induced cell-kill in metastatic lesions. Therefore, to estimate ωi, we compare it to the drug’s cell-kill
eﬀect in the primary tumor. More speciﬁcally, a chemotherapy dose of ct mg/m2 on day t reduces
the primary-tumor cell population by a factor of e−θct, in which θ has a m2/mg unit (see equation

(2.1)). It also reduces the metastatic cell population 24 hours after delivering the chemotherapy at
site i by a factor of e−ωict, and thus ωi has a m2/mg per day unit (see equation (2.3)). Comparing
the two cell-kill factors in the primary tumor and metastatic site i, we set the cell-kill parameter to
ωi = ζiθ, in which ζi (with unit day−1) is a positive constant depending on the drug’s concentration
and sensitivity of metastatic cells to chemotherapy at the ith site. The constant ζi = 1 represents
a similar drug’s concentration and cell-kill in both the primary tumor and the metastatic lesion at

For numerical implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm, we discretize the total
radiation dose and dose squared (Ut, Vt) and total chemotherapy drug (St) in the case where
conditions stated in Theorem 1 do not hold. In case of the two-dimensional (2D) state space, we
use 2,500 points for discretization of Ut and Vt for every time instant. When evaluating the cost-
to-go function Jt(Ut, Vt) for values in between discretization points, we use bilinear interpolation.
For the radiation dose fractions, we allow only multiples of 0.1 Gy. However, for the case of the
three-dimensional (3D) state space, the application of dynamic programming is computationally
very expensive. Hence, to ease the computational burden, we only allow integer multiples of dt and
multiples of 100 mg/m2 of ct. The allowed range for the cumulative dose, cumulative dose squared
and cumulative drug states are [0,(cid:98)BEDj/γj(cid:99)], [0,(cid:98) [α/β]j BEDj

(cid:99)], and [0, Cmax], respectively.

chemotherapy eﬀects at distant metastatic sites (ζ1 = ··· = ζn) for a wide range of values of
parameters ζi and ξ. In particular, when we assume equal ζi for all distant metastasis sites or the
goal is to minimize metastatic tumor cells at a single metastatic site, then conditions stated in
Theorem 1 are always satisﬁed, and the optimal regimen is delivering cmax mg/m2 at consecutive
treatment sessions concentrated at either the beginning or the end of the planning horizon.
Figure 2 plots the optimal radiotherapy fractionation schedule for three diﬀerent values of
[α/β] = {3, 12, 20} and f = {70%, 98%}. We observe that when we are evaluating metastatic cell
population, independent of the relationship between [α/β] and min{[α/β]j /γj}j=1,...,M , the result-
ing fractionation schedules for minimizing expected metastatic cell population is a hypo-fractionated
structure with large initial doses that taper oﬀ quickly. However, when [α/β] is suﬃciently large
and we choose a value for f close to 1, then in order to satisfy inequality (3.10), the optimal sched-
ule tends to be a semi-hypo-fractionation schedule with large initial doses that taper oﬀ slowly.
We perform an extensive sensitivity analysis of the radiotherapy optimal solution with respect to
model parameters (T , ξ, N , Tk). We observe that the radiotherapy optimal schedule is robust to
perturbations in these parameters and only depends on [α/β], {[α/β]i /γi}i=1,...,M and f .

To study the structure of the optimal schedules when conditions stated in Theorem 1 are not sat-
isﬁed, we use our dynamic programming approach with a 3D state space to solve our optimization
problem for a wide range of values of ξ and pi. We observe that the optimal radiotherapy schedule
is determined independently of ξ, θ, pi, and ωi and follows the same pattern as displayed in Figure
2. Figure 3 illustrates optimal chemotherapy regimens for diﬀerent values of pi and ξ when reduc-
ing ζ of the lung to one-third for ﬁxed values of [α/β] = 12 and f = 70%. By reducing the value
of ω in the lung, we ensure that a hypo-fractionated chemotherapy regimen concentrated at the
beginning of therapy minimizes the metastasis population in the lung, whereas a hypo-fractionated

in plots (a) and (b) indicate that when [α/β] ≤ minj{[α/β]j /γj}, a hypo-fractionated schedule

[α/β], i.e., [α/β] > minj{[α/β]j /γj}, where an equal-dosage routine (hyper-fractionated schedule)
minimizes the number of tumor cells at the conclusion of therapy, a hypo-fractionated schedules is
still the best solution to minimizing the metastatic cell population. By increasing the parameter f
for tumors with large values of [α/β], in order to satisfy the BED constraint stated in (3.10), we
observe that the resulting fractionation schedules is a semi-hypo-fractionated structure with large
initial doses that taper oﬀ slowly.

(a) Optimal chemotherapy regimen for diﬀerent values of plung.

chemotherapy regimen concentrated at the end of the planning horizon minimizes the metastasis
population at three other distant metastatic sites, i.e., nodes, bone, and abdomen. Figure 3 (a)
shows that if the probability of metastasis occurrence in the lung is small (large), then the optimal
chemotherapy regimen is dominated by the schedule that minimizes expected metastatic population
at the other three sites (lung), i.e., a hypo-fractionated chemotherapy regimen concentrated at the
end (beginning) of the planning horizon. For moderate values of plung, e.g., plung = 0.35, approxi-
mately half of the total chemotherapy doses is administrated at the beginning of the therapy, and
the rest is delivered toward the end of the planning horizon. Figure 3 (b) illustrates how parameter
ξ changes the optimal solution in the case where conditions stated in Theorem 1 do not hold, e.g.,
ξ ∈ (0.3, 1). In particular, we observe that for high (low) values of ξ, the overall structure of an
optimal solution is dominated by the schedule that minimizes the expected metastatic population
in the lung (nodes, bones and abdomen).

We consider the relative eﬀectiveness of an optimized schedule versus a standard schedule (de-
livering 45 Gy of radiotherapy with 1.8 Gy fractions per day in ﬁve weeks and 8, 000 m2/mg of
5-FU with 1, 000 m2/mg per day delivered on Tuesdays, Wednesday, Thursday, and Fridays of the
ﬁrst and fourth weeks [32]). In particular, we denote the approximate metastatic population at
n sites under the optimized schedule when setting f = x% in (3.10) by Rx
opt and the metastatic
population under a standard uniform fractionation by Rstd. Then we denote the BED delivered to
the primary tumor under optimized and standard schedules by BEDx
opt and BEDstd, respectively.
The ratios (Rstd − Rx
opt)/BEDstd will give us a measure of the pre-
dicted relative reduction in metastasis population and tumor BED, respectively, associated with
using the optimized schedule with f = x% instead of the standard schedule. The results illustrated
in Figure 4 show that the choice of f < 100% can lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in metastasis
population for all values of [α/β] and ξ. Note that for [α/β] ≥ (mini [α/β]i /γi = 3.3), the standard

regimen is indeed the optimal schedule for the conventional fractionation problem that maximizes
TCP [4, 2], whereas a hypo-fractionated radiotherapy schedule minimizes the metastatic population
size. Hence, Figure 4 illustrates the trade-oﬀ between the two conﬂicting objectives: (i) minimiz-
ing metastatic population size and (ii) maximizing tumor TCP for diﬀerent [α/β] and ξ values.
One can observe a diminishing return in the reduction of the metastatic population. In particular,
the fractionation solution obtained by setting 1 − f = 4% seems to yield an interesting trade-oﬀ
between the two objectives beyond which allowing for larger tumor BED reductions, i.e., using
smaller f = x%, does not lead to any signiﬁcant gain in metastatic-population reduction (with the
exception of very small values of ξ). Last, for the tumor [α/β] < 3.3, the two objectives (i) and (ii)
are not of a conﬂicting nature since a hypo-fractionated regimen is desired by both objectives.

5 Conclusion

In previous work that considers optimal fractionation of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the goal
has been to maximize the probability of controlling the primary tumor, i.e., local control. From the
observation that the majority of cancer fatalities are due to metastatic disease ([17]), we consider
an alternative objective: design fractionation schedules of chemotherapy and radiotherapy that
minimize the metastatic population over a suﬃciently long window of time. The current work is a
signiﬁcant extension of our previous work [3], which incorporates multi-site metastatic disease, cell
growth at the metastatic site, and additive and spatial cooperation mechanisms of chemoradiother-
apy. We modeled the metastasis population as a multi-type non-homogeneous branching process,
where each successful metastatic cell is able to colonize a new tumor at one of the several potential
distant sites with a known probability. We were able to derive closed-form solutions to optimal
chemotherapy regimens under easily veriﬁed conditions and proved an interesting structure of op-

16

timal radiotherapy schedules. We numerically solved this optimization problem using a dynamic
programming approach.

The resulting optimal schedules had an interesting structure that is quite diﬀerent from that
observed in the traditional optimal fractionation problem where, the goal is to minimize the local
tumor population at the conclusion of therapy. In the traditional optimal fractionation problem,
it was shown that if the tumor [α/β] ratio is smaller (bigger) than the eﬀective [α/β] ratio of all
organs-at-risk (OAR), then a hypo-fractionated (hyper-fractionated) schedule is optimal [29]. In
the current work, we proved that optimal radiation dose vector suggests a non-increasing structure
and furthermore that it is optimal to immediately start radiotherapy treatment. In this paper,
we numerically observed that, independent of the relationship between tumor [α/β] ratios and all
OARs, the fractionation schedule that minimizes the metastatic population is a hypo-fractionated
structure with large initial doses that taper oﬀ quickly. This result is partially consistent with our
previous work, where the beneﬁt of hypo-fractionation was observed for low values of the tumor
[α/β] ratio and high values of the tumor [α/β] ratio, if the length of time for which we evaluated
metastatic risk is short [3]. In the current work, we observed that if we consider metastases as
actively growing tumor cell colonies and model them as a non-homogeneous branching process,
then regardless of evaluation period and magnitude of tumor [α/β] ratio, our results show that a
hypo-fractionated schedule is nearly always optimal.

Our sensitivity analysis reveals that chemotherapeutic agents do not change the optimal radi-
ation fractionation regimens, and vice-versa. We proved that it is always optimal to deliver the
maximum drug concentration allowed during the course of therapy, Cmax. When the value θξ,
where θ is the chemotherapy-induced cell-kill at the primary site and ξ is the fractal dimension
of the primary tumor cells capable of metastasizing, is larger than the chemotherapy-induced cell-
kill at all distant sites (maxi=1,...,n{ωi}), the optimal chemotherapy fractionation regimen suggests
delivering Cmax in consecutive days starting from the ﬁrst day of the planning horizon and admin-
istering the maximum tolerable daily dose at each fraction (concurrent regimen). However, under
condition θξ < mini=1,...,n{ωi}, it is optimal to postpone delivering chemotherapy until the end of
treatment (adjuvant regimen). We observed that when these two conditions are not satisﬁed, the
optimal regimen is delivering a portion of the total chemotherapeutic agents at the beginning of
the planning horizon and administrating the remaining amount at the end of the therapy. This
portion is a function of θ, ξ, the probability that a successful metastatic cell colonizes at a spe-
ciﬁc distant site and ωi for each site. This can be compared to the chemoradiotherapy regimens
obtained by Salari et al. [37] for TCP maximization in which chemotherapeutic agents with only
an additive tumor cell-kill are administered at the maximum dose allowed without inﬂuencing the
optimal radiation fractionation scheme.

Interestingly, previous clinical trials (e.g., for a review see [16]) show the beneﬁt of chemora-
diotherapy on overall and progression-free survival, and local and distant control in patients with
cervical cancer. In particular, in clinical trials, it was observed that there is a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in the rate of distant metastases in patients diagnosed with cervical cancer treated with both
platinum and non-platinum chemotherapy. This reduction was achieved with a short course of
chemotherapy combined with local treatment. However, there is presently no evidence that neoad-
juvant chemoradiotherapy reduces the incidence of distant metastases, which is consistent with our
result discussed in Remark 1 of Section 3 [16].

Our goal here is not to recommend alternative clinical practice but to assist clinicians with
hypothesis generation to design novel chemoradiotherapy fractionation schemes that can be tested
in clinical trials. Our results provide a motivation for using hypo-fractionated schedules ordered in a

17

non-increasing structure and delivering maximum daily chemotherapeutic agents at the beginning or
towards the end of therapy in pursuit of the reduction of the metastatic population. Our numerical
results suggest that using optimal schedules instead of standard regimens has the potential of
reducing the metastatic population by more than 40%, and even for some cases where the tumor
[α/β] ratio is small, we can improve the tumor BED as well.

This paper motivates an initial idea at developing a new framework for designing more eﬃcient
chemoradiotherapy treatment regimens. Our framework can be elaborated in several directions as
follows.
In our model, it is assumed that the chemotherapeutic drugs administered at previous
treatment fractions do not carry over to the current fraction. However, this may not be necessarily
a valid assumption. Therefore, an important extension of this work will be to incorporate the
eﬀects of previously administered drugs to subsequent fractions. A possible solution to this could
be modeling the eﬀective dose at each fraction as a weighted moving average of the current and
previously administrated doses.

This work considers the problem of ﬁnding radiation and chemotherapy schedules that optimally
minimize the total metastatic populations. While the parameter values for the present work are
focused on cervical cancer, our work is applicable to a wider range of cancers that are treated via
radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In particular, we are very eager to further investigate additional
cancers where we can implement our model in order to ﬁnd the optimal chemoradiotherapy regimen
and see how these optimal fractionation schedules vary in diﬀerent cancer cases.

Last, our model is based on the assumption that the total population of the primary tumor can
be accurately approximated with a deterministic function. However, the nature of tumor response
to chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation is stochastic and varies across diﬀerent patients.
Therefore, a potentially interesting extension of this work could be modeling the primary tumor
site as a stochastic process as well.

Proof. We use contradiction to prove our result. Let the optimal dose vector be (cid:126)c(cid:48) = {c(cid:48)

t < Cmax. Then, we can always construct a feasible solution (cid:126)c(cid:48)(cid:48) based on (cid:126)c(cid:48) that
contradicts the optimality of (cid:126)c(cid:48). For example ﬁrst we set (cid:126)c(cid:48)(cid:48) = (cid:126)c(cid:48) and then for an arbitrary integer

order independent, i.e., if we change the order of the dose vector, then the resulting dose vector is
(cid:33)
still feasible with the same value for function g; hence, (cid:126)d(cid:48) is a feasible solution to (3.8)–(3.13) where

We can use the same approach to prove the same result for (cid:126)c∗ (see proof of Theorem 1 for more
details).

C Proof of Theorem 1
Proof. We ﬁrst prove our results when θξ ≥ maxi=1,...,n ωi. This condition implies that θ − ωi/ξ ≥
0 for all i = 1, . . . , n. First, we use contradiction to show that, in optimality, we must have
k = cmax for k = (cid:98)Cmax/cmax(cid:99). Assume that there exists an optimal dose vector
1 = ··· = c∗
c∗
(cid:126)c∗ = {c∗

t ≤ cmax for t = 1, . . . , N . Second, the value of

a feasible solution, since (cid:80)N
t =(cid:80)N
function g in (3.8) has the same value for both (cid:126)c∗ and (cid:126)c(cid:48), since(cid:80)N

Note that c(cid:48)
we have c(cid:48)
∀l ≥ j and ∀l < i.
t = Cmax. Hence, we can
repeat the above procedure to improve the optimal solution until we get c∗
k = cmax
for k = (cid:98)Cmax/cmax(cid:99), where no more improvement can be achieved. At this step, we have two
scenarios: ﬁrst, (cid:98)Cmax/cmax(cid:99) ∈ N, where we must have c∗
N = 0, which proves our
t=k+1 ct = Cmax − kcmax < cmax. In this case,
by using the same contradiction as before, we can show that if we choose ck+1 < Cmax − kcmax,
then we can always construct a feasible solution with a smaller objective function.
In this case, we have θ − ωi/ξ <
0, ∀i = 1, . . . , n. Therefore, for any schedule with c∗
i < cmax and c∗
j > 0 for i > j, we can construct
j} > c∗
a new feasible solution (cid:126)c(cid:48) = {c(cid:48)

We can use a similar approach when θξ < mini=1,...,n ωi.
