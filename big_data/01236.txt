Generating Asymptotics

for factorially divergent sequences

Michael Borinsky∗

Abstract

The algebraic properties of formal power series with factorial growth which admit a
certain well-behaved asymptotic expansion are discussed. These series form a subring of
R[[x]] which is closed under composition. An ‘asymptotic derivation’ is deﬁned which maps
a power series to its asymptotic expansion. Leibniz and chain rules for this derivation are
deduced. With these rules implicitly deﬁned power series can be solved for their asymptotic
expansions. The full asymptotic expansions of the number of connected chord diagrams and
the number of simple permutations are given as examples.

The subject of this article are sequences an which admit an asymptotic expansion of the form,

for some α, β ∈ R>0 and dk ∈ R. Sequences of this type appear in many enumeration problems,
which deal with coeﬃcients of factorial growth. For instance, generating functions of subclasses
of permutations and graphs of bounded valence show this behaviour. Furthermore, there are
countless examples where perturbative expansions of physical quantities, for example in quantum
mechanics, quantum ﬁeld theory, statistical physics, matrix models and ﬂuid dynamics, admit
an asymptotic expansions of this kind. In this article these sequences will be interpreted as the
coeﬃcients of a formal power series. It is well known that formal power series a ∈ R[[x]] whose
coeﬃcients are bounded by some factorial growth |an| ≤ CαnΓ(n + β) are closed under addition,
multiplication, inversion and composition. This article is an attempt to convince the reader that
even more structure can be found if we restrict ourselves to formal power series which admit a
well-behaved asymptotic expansion as above. This approach is inspired by the work of Bender
[6] in which the asymptotic behaviour of the composition of a mildly growing with a rapidly
growing power series is analyzed.

1.1 Statement of results

Power series with well-behaved asymptotic expansions, as in the example above, form a subring of
R[[x]], which will be denoted as R[[x]]α
β → R[[x]], can be deﬁned which
maps a power series to its own asymptotic expansion. This map turns out to be a derivation,
that means it fulﬁlls a Leibniz rule

where (f · g)(x) = f (x)g(x) and (f ◦ g)(x) = f (g(x)). Note that the chain rule involves a peculiar
correction term if f has a non-trivial asymptotic expansion. The formalism can therefore be
applied to calculate the asymptotic expansions of implicitly deﬁned power series. This procedure
is similar to the extraction of the ordinary derivative of an implicitly deﬁned function using
the implicit function theorem. In the sections 2-4 we will describe the derivation ring R[[x]]α
β
and prove our main theorem 4.2, which establishes the chain rule for the asymptotic derivation.
Additionally, we will sketch some possible connections to the broad theory of diﬀerential equations
and resummation in section 5. In section 6, we demonstrate the apparatus by stating the full
asymptotic expansions for the number of connected chord diagrams and for the number of simple
permutations.

1.2 Notation
We will denote a (formal) power series f ∈ R[[x]] in the usual ‘functional’ notation f (x) =
P∞n=0 fnxn. The coeﬃcients of a power series f will be expressed by the same symbol with
the index attached as a subscript fn or with the coeﬃcient extraction operator [xn]f (x) = fn.
Ordinary (formal) derivatives are expressed as f′(x) =P∞n=0 nfnxn−1. The ring of power series

which represent expansions of functions which are analytic at the origin or equivalently power

2

series with non-vanishing radius of convergence will be denoted as R{x}. We will make use of
the O-notation: O(an) denotes the set of all sequences bn such that limn→∞ | bn
an | < ∞ and o(an)
all sequences bn such that limn→∞ | bn
an| = 0. Equations of the form an = bn + O(cn) are to be
interpreted as statements an − bn ∈ O(cn) as usual. See [5] for an introduction to this notation.

2 Prerequisites

We start by establishing a suitable notion of a power series with a well-behaved asymptotic
expansion.
Deﬁnition 2.1. For given α, β ∈ R>0 let R[[x]]α
if and only if,

β be the subspace of R[[x]], such that f ∈ R[[x]]α

β

1. there exists some ﬁnite constant Cf ∈ R, such that

fn

αn+βΓ(n + β)

lim
n→∞

= Cf ,

(2.1)

2. and there exist a ˜f ∈ R[[x]]α

β , whose coeﬃcients are
˜fn = fn+1 − Cf αn+1+βΓ(n + 1 + β)

∀n ∈ N0.

(2.2)

This recursive deﬁnition guarantees the existence of a suitable asymptotic expansion of every

power series in R[[x]]α
Proposition 2.1. If f ∈ R[[x]]α
such that,

β as formulated in

β and R ∈ N0 given, then there are constants c0, . . . , cR−1 ∈ R

fn =

R−1

Xk=0

αn+β−kΓ(n + β − k)ck + O (αnΓ(n + β − R)) .

(2.3)

Proof. Solving eq. (2.2) for fn gives us the ﬁrst term for the asymptotic expansion,

(2.4)
because ˜fn−1 ∈ O(αnΓ(n+ β− 1)) as required in eq. (2.1). Since ˜f is required to be an element of
R[[x]]α
β as well, we can iterate this procedure and obtain an asymptotic expansion up to arbitrary
order:

fn = Cf αn+β Γ(n + β) + ˜fn−1,

fn = Cf αn+βΓ(n + β) + C ˜f αn−1+βΓ(n − 1 + β) + ˜˜fn−2
= Cf αn+βΓ(n + β) + C ˜f αn−1+βΓ(n − 1 + β) + C ˜˜f
. . .

αn−2+βΓ(n − 2 + β) +

˜˜˜fn−2

Remark 2.1. Eq. (2.5) represents an asymptotic expansion or Poincar´e expansion with the asymp-
totic scale αnΓ(n + β) [13, Ch. 1.5].
Remark 2.2. The subspace R[[x]]α
β includes all (real) power series whose coeﬃcients only grow
exponentially. These power series are expansions of real functions which are analytic at the
origin. They are denoted as R{x}.

3

Remark 2.3. Also series which only grow less than αnΓ(n + β − R) for all ﬁxed R ≥ 0 have a
trivial asymptotic expansion of the form in eq. (2.3) with all the ck = 0.
Remark 2.4. The power series in R[[x]]α
gevrey-1 is not suﬃcient for a power series to be in R[[x]]α
behaves for large n as an ∼ n!(1 + 1√n + O( 1

β are a subset of gevrey-1 sequences [15, Ch XI-2]. Being
β . For instance, a sequence which

n )) is gevrey-1, but not in R[[x]]α
β .

The central idea in this article is to interpret the coeﬃcients ck in the asymptotic expansion
β , which maps a formal

β on R[[x]]α

as another power series. Therefore, we deﬁne a linear map Aα
power series to its asymptotic expansion:
β : R[[x]]α
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let Aα
to every power series f ∈ R[[x]]α

β → R[[x]] be the map that associates a power series Aα
β such that,

β f ∈ R[[x]]

R−1

fn =

αn+β−kΓ(n + β − k)[xk](Aα

Xk=0
β also gives an algorithm to compute (Aα

β f )(x) + O (αnΓ(n + β − R)) .

(2.5)

Remark 2.5. The procedure given in deﬁnition 2.1 to decide if a power series f ∈ R[[x]] is
contained in R[[x]]α

β f )(x) order by order.

Example 2.1. The power series f ∈ R[[x]] associated to the sequence fn = n! clearly fulﬁlls the
requirements of deﬁnition 2.1 with α = 1 and β = 1. Therefore, f ∈ R[[x]]1
1f )(x) = 1.

It gives an

Xk=R1

Γ(k + β2)Γ(n − k + β1) ∈ O(Γ(n − R1 + β1)) ∪ O(Γ(n − R2 + β2)).

n−R2 ).

(3.2)

Proof. Note that the ﬁrst equation is only a statement for large n, as the O always refers to the
limit n → ∞ in the scope of this article.
The ﬁrst statement is a direct consequence of the second. Γ is a log-convex function. Hence,
Γ(k + β2)Γ(n − k + β1) is a convex function in k. For R1 ≤ k ≤ n − R2 it follows that

Γ(k + β1)Γ(n − k + β2)

≤ max(Γ(R1 + β1)Γ(n − R2 + β2), Γ(n − R1 + β1)Γ(R2 + β2)).

(3.3)

Using this inequality, we can estimate the sum Pn−R2

(3.5)

Additionally, we have n−R1−R2−2 ≤ n−R1−1+β1 as well as n−R1−R2−2 ≤ n−R2−1+β2.
The statement follows.

An immediate consequence of this observation on sums of products of Γ-functions is

β is a derivation. If f, g ∈ R[[x]]α

It remains to be shown that the last sum in eq. (3.7) is negligible. We can always ﬁnd
constants Cf and Cg such that |fn| ≤ Cf αnΓ(n + β) and |gn| ≤ CgαnΓ(n + β), because fn, gn ∈
O(αnΓ(n + β)). Hence, we can make the estimate

which is in O(αnΓ(n − R + β)) as a direct consequence of lemma 3.1.
Corollary 3.1. R[[x]]α

β forms a subring of R[[x]].

Remark 3.1. A shift of β by a positive integer shifts the asymptotic expansion by one coeﬃcient
as can easily be seen in eq. (2.5). Therefore,

R[[x]]α

β ⊂ R[[x]]α

β+1 ⊂ R[[x]]α

β+2 ⊂ . . . ⊂ R[[x]]α

β+m ⊂ . . .

commutes, where xm is the operator that multiplies xm. The requirement β > 0 is therefore
only a spurious restriction. We can always work in the ideal xmR[[x]]α
β , which can be associated
with R[[x]]α
β−m. Note that we consider an asymptotic expansion as in eq. (2.5) perfectly valid if
the ﬁrst coeﬃcients ck, for instance up to order m, vanish.

Remark 3.3. Note, that for all β1, β2 ∈ R>0 we have αn

Therefore, there is another hierarchy of rings: If α1, α2, β1, β2 ∈ R>0 with β1 = β2 + m where
m ∈ Z, then

β with β ≤ 0 is to use the ﬁeld of (formal)
β and demand that negative powers of x commute

Proof. Proof by induction using the Leibniz rule proved in proposition 3.1.

Of course, this also implies (Aα

β f )(x). Here, we have the ﬁrst hints
that Aα
β fulﬁlls a ‘chain rule’. This and the next section will deal with the question, how to
generalize this to more general compositions of power series. Eventually, we want to be able to
calculate the asymptotics for arbitrary compositions of power series in R[[x]]α
β in terms of the
asymptotics of the components.

Proof. The statement follows by substituting the asymptotic expansion ofQL

in lemma 4.1, into the left hand side of the equation. It is crucial that we are dealing with a
ﬁnite sum over the tl. Otherwise, we would not be able to neglect the term

which appears after the substitution of the expansion.

Although the right hand side of eq. (4.2) might suggest so, this identity does not equip us
β . The reason is that we only considered a truncated sum over the tl with
l=1 tl ≤ n. Furthermore, we
β f (x)t)(x) =

always require that R is a constant which does not depend on n. Accordingly (Aα
tf (x)t−1(Aα

β f )(x) does not imply any bounds on [xn]g(x)t for t of order n.

4.1 Composition by analytic functions

In [6] Edward Bender established conditions for the case L = 1 on the sequences fn and gn which
ensure that the remaining sum over the t1 in the lemma above can be neglected for n → ∞ and
the asymptotic expansion of f ◦ g is given by the right hand side of eq. (4.2) with L = 1. In fact,
he analyzed more general power series including sequences with even more rapid than factorial
growth. If for example g ∈ R[[x]]α
β and f ∈ R{x, y}, the power series expansion of an analytic
function at the origin, then his theorem 1 allows us to calculate the asymptotics of the power series
f (g(x), x). The next lemma and the theorem following it are a straightforward generalization
of Bender’s lemma 2 and theorem 1 in [6] to the multivariate case f ∈ R{y1, . . . , yL}. We will
follow Bender’s reasoning closely in

Lemma 4.3. If g1, . . . , gL ∈ R[[x]]α
a constant C such that,

β with g(l)

0 = 0 for all l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, then we can always ﬁnd

≤ C LαnΓ(n + β − L + 1)

∀n ∈ N0.

nγe
of the compositional inverse in eq. (4.40) can be obtained from this. Therefore, theorem 4.2 can
be seen as a generalization of Bender and Richmond’s result.

α gn + O(gn) if g ∈ R[[x]]α

In the same article Bender and Richmond proved a similar theorem as theorem 4.2 for power
series f which grow more rapidly than factorial such that nfn−1 ∈ o(fn). Theorem 4.2 establishes
a link to the excluded case nfn−1 = O(fn).
Remark 4.2. In quantum ﬁeld theory the coupling, an expansion parameter, needs to be reparametrized
in the process of renormalization [12]. Those reparametrizations are merely compositions of
power series which are believed to be gevrey-1. Therefore, theorem 4.2 might be useful for the
resummation of renormalized quantities in quantum ﬁeld theory.
Remark 4.3. The R[[x]]α
β is therefore closed under multiplication, addition and compositions of
power series g with g0 = 0 and g1 = 1. Note that g1 = 1 is not a serious restriction because
scalings f (Cx) with C ∈ R>0 are only trivial isomorphisms of rings R[[x]]α

5 Some remarks on diﬀerential equations

Theorem 4.1 serves as a good starting point to analyze diﬀerential equations with power series
solutions in R[[x]]α
β . Given an analytic function F ∈ R{x, y0, . . . , yL}, we can use the Aα
β -
derivation on the general diﬀerential equation

0 = F (x, f (x), f′(x), f′′(x), . . . , f (L)(x)).

(Aα

The diﬀerential equation becomes a linear equation for the asymptotic expansions of the deriva-
tives f (l). This raises the question how these diﬀerent asymptotic expansions relate to each other.
In fact there is a bijective correspondence between them.

Proposition 5.1. Let ∂x denote the ordinary diﬀerential on power series. Restricted to R[[x]]α
β
this operator has the properties

∂x : R[[x]]α

β+2,

β → R[[x]]α

commutes,

(5.4)

where the operator dα

β := α−1 − xβ + x2∂x is injective.

(5.5)

13

Proof. (5.3) and (5.4) can be veriﬁed by using ∂xf (x) =P∞n=0 nfnxn−1 on asymptotic expansions
in eq. (2.5). Set h(x) = x2∂xf such that, for n ≥ 1

hn = (n − 1)fn−1 =

αn−1+β−k(n − 1)Γ(n − 1 + β − k)[xk](Aα

β f )(x) + O (αnΓ(n − 1 + β − R)) .

(5.6)

An elementary calculation reveals,

Xk=0

β f )(x) + O (αnΓ(n − 1 + β − R)) .

(5.7)

β and Aα

β x2∂x = (α−1 − xβ + x2∂x)Aα

which shows that h ∈ R[[x]]α
follows that ∂xf ∈ R[[x]]α
β+2.
β = α−1 − xβ + x2∂x is not injective. Consequently, there must be some
Suppose, that dα
β . That means, (α−1 − xβ + x2∂x)f (x) = 0 with f (x) 6= 0. If f (x) 6= 0 there
non-trivial f ∈ ker dα
must be some n such that fn 6= 0 and fk = 0 for 0 ≤ k < n. Substituting this ﬁrst term gives
(α−1xk − xk+1β + kxk+1)fk = 0, which only has a solution if α−1 = 0, which is excluded.
Corollary 5.1. If F ∈ R{x, y0, . . . , yL} and f ∈ R[[x]]α
diﬀerential equation

β is a solution of the possibly non-linear

β . Since x2∂xf (x) = h(x), it

0 = F (x, f (x), f′(x), f′′(x), . . . , f (L)(x)),

(5.9)

Remark 5.1. Even if we know that a solution to a diﬀerential equation has a well-behaved
asymptotic expansion, corollary 5.1 provides this asymptotic expansion only up to the initial
values for the linear diﬀerential equation (5.9). Note that the form of the asymptotic expansion
can still depend non-trivially on the initial values of the solution f of the nonlinear diﬀerential
equation.

Remark 5.2. The linear diﬀerential equation (5.9) can be interpreted as an eigenvalue problem
with α−1, β as eigenvalues and the asymptotic expansion as eigenvector. In [4] this phenomenon
has been interpreted as a kind of quantization.
Remark 5.3. The linear diﬀerential equation (5.9) only has a non-trivial solution if α−1 is the
root of a certain polynomial. If this root is not real or if two roots have the same modulus, the
present formalism has to be generalized to also deal with complex α and multiple α to be able to
express the asymptotic expansion of a general solution. This generalization is straightforward.
We merely need to generalize the deﬁnition 2.1 of suitable sequences to:
Deﬁnition 5.1. With β ∈ R>0, α1, . . . , αL ∈ C and |α1| = |α2| = . . . = |αL| =: α > 0, f ∈

We will give a more detailed account to these spaces and their properties in a future publi-

cation [10].
Remark 5.4. The power series in R[[x]]α
β can be interpreted as expansions of solutions of dif-
ferential equations at an essential singularity. There are diﬀerent techniques, sometimes named
‘hyperasymptotics’, to reobtain a well deﬁned function from the formal power series or pertur-
bative expansion. One method is Borel-resummation, where the divergent series is expressed as
the Laplace-transformation of a well-behaved function.

In the present notation the constant α−1 gives the position of the ﬁrst singularity of the

Borel-transformation of a power series in R[[x]]α
β .

The asymptotic derivative Aα

The systematic study of these resummed functions is the subject of resurgence. A theory
introduced by Jean Ecalle. For an introduction aimed at a physically oriented audience see [2].
β , therefore gives information
about the behaviour of the Borel-transformation near this singularity at α−1. In this way the
alien derivative in resurgence theory seems to correspond to the Aα
β derivative, although the
notion of the alien derivative is highly intertwined with the notion of the Borel-transformation
of f .

β f of a power series f ∈ R[[x]]α

The phenomena described here can be interpreted as ‘resurgent’ in the way that the low
order expansion of a generating function appears in diﬀerent shape in the high order expansion.
One might say that there is an ‘interaction’ between both. This phenomenon will also become
apparent in the following applications.

6.1 Chord diagrams

A chord diagram with n-chords is a circle with 2n points, which are labeled with integers 1, . . . , 2n
and connected in disjoint pairs by n-chords. There are (2n − 1)!! of such diagrams.

6.1.1 Connected diagrams

A chord diagram is connected if no set of chords can be separated from the remaining chords by

a line which does not cross any chords. Let I(x) = Pn=0(2n − 1)!!xn and C(x) = Pn=0 Cnxn,

where Cn is the number of connected chord diagrams with n chords. I(x) and C(x) are related
by,

I(x) = 1 + C(xI(x)2).

(6.1)

See for instance [14] for a proof. This functional equation can be solved for the coeﬃcients of
C(x) by basic iterative methods. The ﬁrst few terms are,

C(x) = x + x2 + 4x3 + 27x4 + 248x5 + . . .

The ﬁrst term, e−1, in this expansion has been computed by Kleitman [16], Stein and Everett
[19] and Bender and Richmond [7] each using diﬀerent methods. With the present method an
arbitrary number of coeﬃcients can be computed.

6.1.2 Monolithic diagrams

A chord diagram is called monolithic if it consists only of a connected component and of isolated
chords which do not ‘contain’ each other [14]. That means with (a, b) and (c, d) the labels of

such edges we do not allow a < c < d < b or c < a < b < d. Let M (x) = Pn=0 Mnxn be the

generating function of monolithic chord diagrams. Following [14], M (x) fulﬁlls

A permutation is called simple if it does not map a non-trivial interval to another interval.
Expressed formally, the permutation π ∈ Ssimple
⊂ Sn if and only if π([i, j]) 6= [k, l] for all
i, j, k, l ∈ [0, n] with 2 ≤ |[i, j]| ≤ n − 1. See Albert et al. [1] for more detailed exposition of
simple permutations. Set S(x) = P∞n=4 |Ssimple
|xn and F (x) = P∞n=1 n!xn. Following [1], S(x)
and F (x) fulﬁll the functional equation
F (x) − F (x)2

= x + S(F (x)).

This can be solved iteratively for the coeﬃcients of S(x):

In Neil Sloane’s online encyclopedia this sequence is entry A111111 [18] with a slightly diﬀerent
convention: A111111 = 1 + 2x + S(x)/x.

as the diﬀerential equation x2F ′(x) + (x − 1)F (x) + x = 0, it is easily to solve this for (A1

Albert et al. [1] calculated the ﬁrst three terms of this expansion. With the presented methods
the calculation of the asymptotic expansion (A1
1S)(x) up to order n is as easy as calculating the
expansion of S(x) up to order n + 2.
Remark 6.1. The examples above are chosen to demonstrate that given a (functional) equation
which relates two power series in R[[x]]α
β , it is an easy task to calculate the full asymptotic
expansion of one of the power series from the asymptotic expansion of the other power series.

Applications include functional equations for ‘irreducible combinatorial objects’. The two
examples fall into this category. Irreducible combinatorial objects were studied in general by
Beissinger [3].
Remark 6.2. Dyson-Schwinger equations in quantum ﬁeld theory can be stated as functional
equations of this form [11, 8]. In a future publication [9] we will elaborate on this idea in the
scope of zero-dimensional quantum ﬁeld theory.
