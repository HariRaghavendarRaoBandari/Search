Abstract: We reformulate the Matrix theory of D-particles in a manifestly Lorentz-
covariant fashion in the sense of 11 dimesnional ﬂat Minkowski space-time, from the view-
point of the so-called DLCQ interpretation of the light-front Matrix theory. The theory
is characterized by various symmetry properties including higher gauge symmetries, which
contain the usual SU(N ) symmetry as a special case and are extended from the structure
naturally appearing in association with a discretized version of Nambu’s 3-bracket. The
theory is scale invariant, and the emergence of the 11 dimensional gravitational length,
or M-theory scale, is interpreted as a consequence of a breaking of the scaling symmetry
through a super-selection rule. In the light-front gauge with the DLCQ compactiﬁcation
of 11 dimensions, the theory reduces to the usual light-front formulation. In the time-like
gauge with the ordinary M-theory spatial compactiﬁcation, it reduces to a non-Abelian
Born-Infeld-like theory.

Keywords: M-theory, D0-branes, Matrix theory, Nambu bracket.

1. Introduction

From the viewpoint of exploring non-perturbative formulations of string theory, the conjec-
ture of 11 dimensional M-theory occupies a special pivotal position in providing a candidate
for the strong-coupling limit of the type IIA (and E8 × E8 Heterotic) string theory. Let us
ﬁrst recall the basic tenets of M-theory conjecture: The background space-time is (10,1)
space-times instead of (9,1) space-times of string theory. The 10-th spatial dimension is
compactiﬁed, x10 ∼ x10 + 2πR11, around a circle of radius R11 = gsℓs, with gs and ℓs being
the string coupling of type IIA superstrings and fundamental string-length constant, re-
spectively. The gravitational scale ℓ11 in 11 dimensions as the sole length scale of M-theory
is related to these string-theory constants by ℓ11 = g1/3
ℓs, so that the theory with a ﬁnite
gravitational length in inﬁnitely (R11 → ∞) extended 11 dimensional space-times corre-
sponds to a peculiar limit of string theory characterized by gs → ∞ and ℓ2
11/R11 → 0.
In particular, the gravitational interactions at long distance scales much larger than ℓ11 are
expected to be described by the classical theory of 11 dimensional supergravity. Dynami-
cal degrees of freedom corresponding to strings are expected to be (super) membranes (or
M2-branes): super membranes wrapped once around the compactiﬁed circle are supposed
to behave as fundamental strings in the remaining 10 dimensional space-time in the limit

gs → 0 with ﬁnite ℓs. Various D-brane (and other) excitations of string theory also ﬁnd
their roles naturally. For instance, D0-branes, namely D-particles, are special Kaluza-Klein
excitations of 11 dimensional gravitons with the single quantized unit p10 = 1/R11 of mo-
mentum along the circle in the 11th dimension. D2-branes are super-membranes lying
entirely in un-compactiﬁed 10 dimensional space-times, and D4-branes are wrapped M5-
branes which are 5-dimensionally extended objects, being dual to M2-branes in the sense
of electromagnetic duality of Dirac with respect to RR gauge ﬁelds, and so on.

In spite of various circumstantial evidence for this remarkable conjecture, only known
and perhaps practically workable example of concrete formulations of M-theory is the
so-called BFSS M(atrix) theory [1]. This proposal was originated from a coincidence of
eﬀective theories for two apparently diﬀerenct objects, namely, D-particles and super-
membranes.
In the limit of small ℓs, the eﬀective low-energy theory [2] for many-body
dynamics of D-particles is supersymmetric SU(N ) Yang-Mills quantum mechanics which
is obtained from the maximally supersymmetric super Yang-Mills theory in 10 dimensions
by dimensional reduction of the base (9,1) space-time to (0,1) world line, in which 9 spatial
components of gauge ﬁelds turn into matrix coordinates as collective variables represent-
ing motion (diagonal matrix elements) and interaction (oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements) of
D-particles in terms of short open strings. Essentially the same super Yang-Mills quantum
mechanics also appears [3] as a possible regularization of a single super membrane formu-
lated in the light-front quantization, approximating to a super membrane in an appropriate
limit of large N . In the latter case, the functional space of membrane coordinates deﬁned
on two-dimensional spatial parameter space of the membrane world-volume is replaced by
the ring of Hermitian N × N matrices. The crux of the proposal was to realize that, by
uniting these two seemingly diﬀerent interpretations as eﬀective theories, the super Yang-
Mills matrix model may hopefully provide not only a regularization of a single membrane,
but more importantly would describe also “partons” for membranes and in principle all
other excitations of M-theory in a more fundamental manner.

Suppose we consider the situation where all of constituent partons have a unit 10-th
momentum p10 = 1/R11 of the same sign (namely, no anti-D-paricles) along the compacti-
ﬁed circle, the total 10-th momentum of a system consisting of N partons is P10 = N/R11 =
N p10. In the limit of large N , it deﬁnes an inﬁnite momentum frame P10 → ∞ along the
compactifed circle. Then the coincidence between the eﬀective non-relativistic Yang-Mills
quantum mechanics of D-branes and the light-front regularization of supermembrane is un-
derstandable. Remember the case of a single relativistic particle with mass-shell condition
P µPµ + m2 = 0,

−P − ≡ P 0 − P 10 =q(P i)2 + m2 + (P 10)2 − P 10 →

(P i)2 + m2

2P 10

(1.1)

with the indices i = 1, 2, . . . , 9 running only over transverse directions. By making identi-
ﬁcation P 10 = N/R11 for the compactiﬁed 10-th direction, we expect that this form of P 0
corresponds to the center-of-mass energy of an N D-particle system, providing that m2 is
the eﬀective relativistically invariant squared mass of the system. We can also adopt an
alternative viewpoint, namely the so-called DLCQ (discrete light-cone quantization) inter-

– 2 –

pretation: instead of 10-th spatial direction, we can assume [4] that a light-like direction
x− ≡ x10 − x0 is compactiﬁed into a circle of radius R with periodicity x− ∼ x− + 2πR.
Then the light-like momentum P + ≡ P 10 + P 0 is discretized, P +/2 = N/R. With the
same proviso for N again as the size of matrices, we have the same expression as (1.1) now
as an exact relation without taking the large N limit

−P − =
but with R11 being replaced by R.

(1.2)

The diﬀerence of these two interpretations lies in the natures of Lorentz symmetry in
11 dimensions. In the former spatial compactiﬁcation scheme, a boost along the compact-
iﬁed 10-th direction is a discrete change of the quantum number N with ﬁxed (and hence
Lorentz invariant) R11, while in the latter that is nothing but a continuous rescaling of R
with ﬁxed N . Thus, in the DLCQ interpretation, N is Lorentz-invariant and P + is a contin-
uously varying dynamical variable. In both cases, however, the limit of un-compactiﬁcation
(namely, strong-coupling limit of type IIA string theory) requires the large N limit, because
in the DLCQ case the longitudinal momentum P + must also become a continuous ﬁnite
variable even in a ﬁxed Lorentz frame which is possible only by allowing inﬁnite R and
N . Further arguments [5] justifying the viewpoint of the DLCQ interpretation were given,
suggesting that it could be understood as a result of taking a limit of large boost from the
former interpretation with small spatial compactiﬁcation radius corresponding to a limit of
weak string coupling. In both cases, the parton interpretation of D-particles requires that
possible KK excitations with multiple units of momenta, such as p10 = 2/R11 or p+ = 4/R
and higher, are interpreted as composite states of two and higher numbers of partons.

It is also to be noted that the theory naturally describes general multi-body states of
these composite states, since N×N matrices contain as subsystems block-diagonal matrices
Ni × Ni with N = Pi Ni. The oﬀ-diagonal blocks then are responsible for interactions

of these subsystems. Therefore, it is essential to treat systems with all diﬀerent N ’s from
N = 2 to inﬁnity on an equal footing, even apart from the requirement of including
all possible values of the total longitudinal momentum. Note also that the exchanges of
longitudinal momentum p10 or p+ among constituent subsystems occur in principle as
processes of rearranging constituent partons in the internal dynamics of SU(N ) Yang-Mills
(super) quantum mechanics.

From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, numerous works testing the proposal appeared.
In particular, the DLCQ interpretation made us possible to perform certain perturbative
analyses of super Yang-Mills quantum mechanics in exploring whether it gives reasonable
gravitational interactions of D-particles and other excitations with respect to scatterings
of those excitations in reduced 10 dimensional space-time. Although we had various en-
couraging results supporting the M(atrix) theory conjecture, the ﬁnal conclusion has not
been reached yet.1

One of the problems left was whether and how fully Lorentz covariant formulations
of the theory would be possible. If we adopt the viewpoint of the DLCQ interpretation

review of the status with an extensive list of literature until around 2000. Unfortunately, we have not

supposing that the Matrix theory with ﬁnite N already gives an exact theory with special
light-like compactiﬁcation, it is not unreasonable to believe the existence of covariant ver-
sion of the ﬁnite N super Yang-Mills mechanics. This is particularly so, if we recall that
the above relation between the discretized light-like momentum and the size of matrices
still allows continuously varying P + with an arbitrary (real and positive) parameter R cor-
responding to boost transformations. Since N is invariant under boost by deﬁnition in the
DLCQ interpretation, it seems natural to imagine a generalization of super Yang-Mills me-
chanics with full covariance allowing general Lorentz transformations for ﬁxed ﬁnite N , not
restricted only to boost transformation along the compactiﬁed circle, with all of the 10+1
directions of eleven dimensional Minkowski space-time being treated equally as matrices or
some extensions of matrices. Otherwise, it seems diﬃcult to justify the DLCQ interpreta-
tion. If such a covariant theory exists as in the case of the ordinary particle mechanics, the
DLCQ matrix theory would be obtained as an exact theory from a covariantized Matrix
theory with a Lorentz-invariant eﬀective mass square. Although we have to take the limit
of large N to elevate it to a full ﬂedged formulation of M-theory, a consistent covariant
formulation with ﬁnite N could be an intermediate step toward our ultimate objective.

With this motivation in mind, we studied in ref. [9] the quantization (or more precisely
discretization) of the Nambu bracket [10]. The Nambu (-Poisson) bracket naturally appears
in covariant treatments of classical membranes. For instance, the bosonic action of a
membrane can be expressed in the form

Amem = −

e{X µ, X ν , X σ}N{Xµ, Xν, Xσ}N − e(cid:17),

(1.3)

(1.4)

giving the Dirac-Nambu-Goto form when the auxiliary variable e is eliminated. Note that
ξa (a, b, c ∈ (1, 2, 0)) parametrize the 3 dimensional world volume of a single membrane,
and space-time indices µ, ν, . . . run over 11 directions of the target space-time. This is
analogous to the treatments of strings where Poisson bracket plays a similar role [11].

In ref. [9] we proposed two possibilities of quantization: one was to use the ordinary
square matrices and their commutators, and the other was more radically to introduce new
objects, cubic matrices with three indices. A natural idea seemed to regularize the above
action (1.3) directly by replacing the NP bracket by a discretized version and the integral
over the world volume by an appropriate “Trace” operation in the algebra of quantized
coordinates corresponding to classical coordinates X µ(ξ). The usual light-front action
should appear as a result of an appropriate gauge ﬁxing of a higher gauge symmetry which
generalizes its continuous counterpart, the area-preserving diﬀeomorphism transformations

seen much progress since then. One thing among more recent works to be mentioned seems that we now
have some suggestive results on non-perturbative properties using numerical simulations. For instance, we
have reported results [7] about the correlation functions of super Yang-Mills quantum mechanics, which are
consistent with the predictions [8] obtained from a “holographic” approach on the relation between 10D
reduced 11D supergravity and super Yang-Mills quantum mechanics.

δX µ = {F, G, X µ}N,

(1.5)

with (F (ξ), G(ξ)) being two independent local gauge parameter-functions. At that time,
we could not accomplish this program. One of the stumbling blocks was our tacit demand
that the light-front time coordinate should also emerge automatically in the process of
gauge ﬁxing. This seemed to be necessary because (1.4) involves a time derivative.

In the present work, we reconsider the program of the covariantization of M(atrix)
theory.2 However, we do not pursue the above mentioned analogy with the theory of su-
per membrane too far. In particular, we do not assume the above relation between the
membrane action and Nambu bracket. Such an analogy does not seem to be essential from
the viewpoint of the DLCQ interpretation with ﬁnite N , since this analogy suggests the
covariance could only be recovered in a large N limit. We use Nambu-type transformations
only as a convenient tool to motivate higher gauge symmetries which would be necessarily
required for achieving manifest covariance using 11 dimensional matrix variables: an appro-
priate gauge-ﬁxing of such higher gauge symmetries would lead us to the usual light-front
theory with 9 dimensional matrix variables.

With regards to the problem of the emergence of time parameter describing the causal
dynamics of matrices, we reset our goal at a lower level. Namely, we introduce from
the outset a single Lorentz invariant (proper) time parameter τ together with an “ein-
bein” auxiliary variable e(τ ), which transforms as dτ e(τ ) = dτ ′e′(τ ′) under an arbitrary
re-parametrization τ → τ ′ and generates the mass-shell condition for the center-of-mass
variables with an eﬀective mass-square operator. Thus the proper-time is essentially as-
sociated with the trajectory of the center-of-mass. From the viewpoint of relativistically
covariant formulation of many-body systems in the conﬁguration-space picture, as opposed
to the usual second-quantized-ﬁeld theory picture, we would expect that the proper time-
parameter should be associated independently with each particle degree of freedom, since
we have to impose mass-shell conditions separately to each particle.3 This is possible in
the usual relativistic quantum mechanics where we can separately treat particle degrees
of freedom and ﬁeld degrees of freedom which mediate interactions among particles, espe-
cially using Dirac’s interaction representation. However, in matrix models such as super
Yang-Mills quantum mechanics, such a separation is not feasible, since the SU(N ) gauge
symmetry associated with matrices requires us to treat the coordinate degrees and inter-
action degrees of freedom embedded together in each matrix inextricably as a single entity.
2For examples of other attempts of applying Nambu brackets towards extended formulations of Matrix
theory, see e.g.
[12] and references therein. For earlier and diﬀerent approaches related to our subject,
see [13] most of which discussed only the bosonic part, and more recent works [14], based on the so-called
‘super-embedding’ method, the latter of which however introduced only SO(9) matrices in contrast to one
of basic requirements stressed in the present paper.

3For instance, we can recall the old many-time formalism [15].

It should be remembered that the
usual Feynman-diagram method is a version of covariant many-body theories in conﬁguration space. The
Feynman parameters or Schwinger parameters play the role of proper times introduced for each world line
separately. It is also to be recalled that one of the Virasoro constraints, P 2 +(X ′)2 = 0, in string theory (and
the similar constraints in membrane theory) can be viewed as a counterpart of the mass-shell condition,
imposed at each points on world sheets (or volumes).

– 5 –

In fact, in either case of M-theory compactiﬁcations formulated by the super Yang-Mills
quantum mechanics, there is no trace of such mass-shell conditions set independently for
each constituent parton. In our approach, the time parameters (not physical time compo-
nents) of all the dynamical degrees of freedom are by deﬁnition synchronized to a single
invariant time parameter of the center-of-mass degrees of freedom. Under this circum-
stance, we extend a higher gauge symmetry exhibited in our version of quantized Nambu
bracket, and argue that it can lead to a mechanism for formulating many-body systems
covariantly in a conﬁguration-space formalism without negative metric, replacing methods
with many independent proper-time parameters, and hopefully characterizing the peculiar
general-relativisitic nature of D-particles as partons of M-theory.

In section 2, we ﬁrst reformulate our old proposal for a discretized Nambu bracket
using matrix commutators in terms of ordinary square matrices to motivate higher gauge
symmetries, and introduce a covariant canonical formalism to develop higher gauge trans-
formations. In section 3, we present the bosonic part of our action. We discuss various
symmetry properties of the action and their implications. In particular, it will be demon-
strated that our theory reduces to the usual formulation of Matrix theory in a light-front
gauge.
In section 4, we extend our theory minimally to a supersymmetric theory, with
some details being relegated to two appendices. In section 5, we summarize our work and
conclude by mentioning various future possibilities and confronting problems.

2. Canonical formalism of higher gauge symmetries

In the present and next sections, for the purpose of elucidating the basic ideas and for-
malisms step by step in a simple setting without complications of fermionic degrees of
freedom, we restrict ourselves to bosonic variables. Extension to including fermionic vari-
ables in a supersymmetric fashion will be discussed later.

In the ﬁrst part, we start from brieﬂy recapitulating our old proposal for a discretized
version of the Nambu bracket in the matrix form as a motivation toward higher gauge
symmetries, and then in the sequel we will extend further and complete the higher gauge
symmetries in the framework of a ﬁrst-order canonical formalism in a relativistically co-
variant fashion.

2.1 From a discretized Nambu 3-bracket to a higher gauge symmetry

Let us denote N × N hermitian matrix variables using slanted boldface symbol,
like
X, Y , Z,··· , and introduce non-matrix variables associated with them and denoted by a
special subscript M , like XM, YM, ZM,··· . All these variables are functions of the invariant
time parameter τ and assumed to be scalar with respect to its re-parameterization. When
we deal with matrix elements explicitly, we designate them by Xab, . . . without boldface
symbol. Originally in ref. [9] we identiﬁed the XM’s to be the traces of the corresponding
matrices. But that is not necessary, and in the present work we treat them as independent
dynamical degrees of freedom.4 This is the price we have to pay to realize a higher gauge
symmetry, but we will have a reward too.

4This situation itself is similar to the so-called Lorentzian version of 3-algebra which was applied in

– 6 –

The discretized NP bracket, which we simply call 3-bracket, is deﬁned as 5

[X, Y, Z] ≡ (0, XM[Y , Z] + YM[Z, X] + ZM[X, Y ]).

(2.1)

Note that the M-component of [X, Y, Z] is zero by deﬁnition. This is totally skew-symmetric
and satisﬁes the so-called Fundamental Identity (FI) essentially as a consequence of the
usual Jacobi identity,

[F, G, [X, Y, Z]] = [[F, G, X], Y, Z] + [X, [F, G, Y ], Z] + [X, Y, [F, G, Z]].

(2.2)

The proof given in ref.
[9], to which we refer readers for further details and relevant
literature related to this identity, goes through as it stands for our slightly extended cases
too.
In particular, the absence ([X, Y, Z]M = 0) of the M-component for the 3-bracket
follows from the property that, for the matrix part of the right-hand side of (2.2), the
contributions involving the commutator [F , G] cancel out among themselves.

If we interpret the bracket [F, G, X] for arbitrary variable X as an inﬁnitesimal gauge
transformation with generators F and G, which are local with respect to the proper time
τ ,

δX ≡ i[F, G, X] = (0, i[FMG − GMF , X] + i[F , G]XM)

(2.3)

as a generalization of (1.5), the FI is nothing but the distribution law of gauge transforma-
tions for 3-bracket. Without losing generality, we deﬁne that the gauge-parameter matrix
functions F and G are both traceless. An important characteristic property [9] of this
gauge transformation is that it enables us to gauge away the traceless part of one of the
matrix variables whenever its M component is not zero, due to the second term in (2.3).
On the other hand, it should be kept in mind that both the trace-part of the matrices and
X µ
M ) against the gauge transformations (2.3). We will later
extend the gauge transformation slightly such that the center-of-mass coordinate (but still
not for XM) is also subject to extended gauge transformations.

M are inert (δX µ

◦ = 0 = δX µ

Actually, it is useful to generalize the above gauge transformation to

δX = iXr

[F r, Gr, X] =(cid:0)0,Xr

i[F r
M

Gr − Gr

M

F r, X] + iXr

[F r, Gr]XM(cid:1)

(2.4)

by introducing an arbitrary number of independent gauge functions discriminated by in-
dices r = 1, 2, . . ..6 Since the FI (2.2) is satisﬁed for each r separately, it is still valid after

attempting to extend the BLG model of conformal ﬁeld theory for M2 branes as a possible eﬀective low
energy description for inﬁnitely extended multiple M2 branes in an SO(8)-invariant fashion. See e.g. [16]
and references therein. However, our interpretation and treatment are quite diﬀerent from such attempts.
In our canonical treatment no indeﬁnite metric appears, except for the usual space-time Lorentz indices.

5This was motivated from Nambu’s deﬁnition of a triple commutator X[Y , Z] + Y [Z, X] + Z[X, Y ]

which, however, does not satisfy the FI.

6Such an extension has been considered already by Nambu [10] himself in his attempt toward a gener-

alized Hamiltonian mechanics.

M

Gr − Gr
[F r, Gr],

H ≡Xr
L ≡ iXr

F r,

(2.5)

(2.6)

can be regarded as being completely independent to each other. In what follows, we assume
this generalized form of gauge transformation,

δHLX ≡ δH X + δLX = (0, i[H, X] + LXM),

(2.7)

with an obvious decomposition into δH and δL. The 3-bracket form of gauge transformation
itself does not play any essential role for our development from this point on, though the
3-bracket notation will still be convenient symbolically in expressing action in a compact
form.

For any pair of two matrices X, Y with vanishing M-components XM = 0 = YM, the

trace of their bilinear product

hX, Y i ≡ Tr(X Y )

(2.8)

is invariant under the gauge transformation, because the gauge transformation then reduces
to a usual SU(N ) transformation δHLX = i[H, X] and δHLY = i[H, Y ] and hence satisﬁes
a derivation property (δHLX)Y + X(δHLY ) = i[H, X Y ]:

δHLhX, Y i ≡ hδHLX, Y i + hX, δHLY i = 0.

(2.9)

Since the 3-brackets of an arbitrary set of matrices always satisfy this condition as empha-
sized above, we have a non-trivial gauge invariant,

h[X, Y, Z], [U, V, W ]i

(2.10)

for arbitrary six variables X, Y,··· , W , due to the FI (2.2). It is to be kept in mind that
for the products of matrices with (either and/or both) non-vanishing M-components, the
gauge transformation does not satisfy the derivation property, and consequently that the
traces of their products are not in general gauge invariant. This constrains systems if we
require symmetry under our gauge transformations.

2.2 Coordinate-type variables

Now we extend a higher gauge symmetry exhibited in the previous subsection within the
framework of ordinary canonical formalism. To represent the dynamical degrees of freedom
in space-time, we endow them with (11 dimensional) space-time Lorentz indices µ, ν, σ,··· .
The generalized coordinate vectors of D-particles are symbolized as X µ = (X µ
M, X µ) by
following the above convention. Their gauge transformations are

δHLX µ

M = 0,

δHLX µ = i[H, X µ] + LX µ
M,

(2.11)

– 8 –

with H and L being traceless and scalar matrices. Thus we have a typical invariant
h[X µ, X ν , X σ], [Xµ, Xν , Xσ]i involving the coordinate-type variables. The center-of-mass
coordinate vector of N partons is X µ
◦ which can be deﬁned independently of N and desig-
nated with a special subscript ◦ as

X µ
◦ ≡

1
N

Tr(X µ), X µ = X µ

◦ + ˆX µ, Tr( ˆX µ) = 0

(2.12)

with ˆX µ being the traceless part. We will suppress the superscript ˆ for matrices which
are deﬁned to be traceless from the beginning, unless otherwise stated.

Since these dynamical variables in general are functions of the proper time parameter
τ , we need to deﬁne covariant derivatives in order to have gauge-invariant kinetic terms.
From the matrix form (2.3), we are led to introduce two kinds of traceless matrix ﬁelds as
gauge ﬁelds, each corresponding to H and L, which we denote by A and B, respectively.
Then, the covariant derivative is deﬁned as

Note that D′X µ

of this covariant derivative will be generalized later, taking into account further extensions
of gauge transformations. It is to be kept in mind that AM and BM are zero by deﬁnition
and also that we introduced the ein-bein e in order to render these expressions manifestly
covariant under re-parametrization of τ , assuming that the gauge ﬁelds are scalar under
the re-parametrization as well as Lorentz transformations.

It is perhaps here appropriate to pay attention to a possible interpretation of the
mysterious additional vector X µ
M. From the viewpoint of 11 dimensional supergravity, the
embedding of the (type IIA) string theory built on a ﬂat 10 dimensional Minkowski space-
time necessitates speciﬁng a background 11-dimensional metric with appropriate boundary
conditions. Remember that the dilaton (and hence, the string coupling gs) emerges in this
process. Consequently, it tacitly introduces a particular Lorentz frame in 11 dimensional
Minkowski space-time. The vector X µ
M can be regarded as playing a similar role in our
covariantized Matrix theory, and for this reason we call X µ
M and its conjugate momentum
P µ
M to be introduced below “M-variables”: hence, with the subscript “M”. We assume that

– 9 –

X µ
M is a conserved vector, and also that just as the 10-dimensional background metrics
and boundary conditions which are not Lorentz invariant are subject to 11-dimensional
Lorentz transformations, the M-variables transform as dynamical vector variables. Further
remarks on the role of the M-variables will be given in section 3.

2.3 Momentum-type variables

In the present paper, we develop a Lorentz-covariant ﬁrst-order formalism by introducing
the conjugate momenta as independent dynamical variables.
In other words, we use a
Hamiltonian formalism with respect to the Lorentz-invariant proper time τ . The canonical
conjugates of the generalized coordinates are denoted by

P µ = (P µ

M, P µ),

(2.18)

where P µ
Poisson algebra are7, exhibiting matrix indices explicitly,

M and P µ are conjugate to X µ

M and X µ, respectively. The equal-time canonical

cd}P = δadδbcηµν ,
ab, P ν

with all other Poisson brackets being zero (e.g. {X µ

M}P = 0, etc).

We demand that the canonical Poisson brackets are preserved by gauge transforma-
tions. The gauge symmetry of the canonical structure ensures us that we can consistently
implement various gauge constraints when we quantize the system. On the basis of this
requirement, we can determine the gauge transformations of canonical momenta uniquely
for the traceless part of matrix variables, together with the M-variables. The results are

δHL ˆP µ = i[H, ˆP µ] = δH P µ,

The mixing of P µ into P µ
and X µ

M in the coordinate part, is necessary to guarantee the vanishing of δHL{X µ

It should be kept in mind that the laws of gauge transformation are diﬀerent between
the coordinate-type and momentum-type variables. In particular, the transformation law
(2.21) ensures that the ordinary traces such as Tr(P µPµ) of products of purely momentum
variables are gauge invariant, as opposed to those involving the coordinate-type matrices.
For arbitrary functions O = O(XM, X, PM, P ) of the generalized coordinates and
momenta, the gauge transformation is expressed as a canonical transformation δHLO =
{O,CHL}P in terms of an inﬁnitesimal generator deﬁned as
M(cid:1)(cid:17),
CHL ≡ Tr(cid:16)Pµ(cid:0)i[H, X µ] + LX µ

(2.24)

7Our Lorentz metric is (1, 1, · · · , 1, −1).

– 10 –

making the invariance of canonical structure under the gauge transformations manifest. We
note that our canonical transformations are explicitly proper-time dependent through time-
dependent H and L. In the usual canonical formalism, such a time-dependent canonical
transformation changes the Hamiltonian by a shift

∂τ CHL ≡ Tr(cid:16)Pµ(cid:0)ih dH

dτ

dL
dτ

X µ

(2.25)

In our generalized relativistically-invariant canonical formalism, this shift-type contribution
is cancelled by the transformations of gauge ﬁelds. This is reasonable since the Hamilto-
nian in our system is zero after all, giving the Hamiltonian constraint associated with
re-parametrization invariance with respect to τ .

Being associated with these transformation laws, the covariant derivatives of momen-

tum variables are

(2.26)

(2.27)

(2.28)

(2.29)

It is important here to notice that these canonical structure and the associated co-
variant derivatives are invariant under a global (not as a local re-parametrization) scaling
transformation τ → λ2τ of the proper time, when the dynamical variables are transformed
as

X µ → λX µ, X µ
P µ → λ−1P µ, P µ
A → λ−2A, B → λ2B.

M → λ−3X µ
M,
M → λ3P µ
M,

Accordingly, the gauge functions must be scaled as

H → H, L → λ4L.

(2.30)

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)

Note that, by deﬁnition, the ein-bein e has zero-scaling dimension, i.e. e → e and also
that the canonical structure alone cannot ﬁx the scaling dimensions of M-variables relative
to those of the matrices and τ . We have chosen these scale dimensions such that the
representative invariants such as h[X µ, X ν , X σ], [Xµ, Xν , Xσ]i and Tr(P µPµ) mentioned
already are allowed to be main ingredients for the action. We also remark that this scaling
symmetry is a disguise of the “generalized conformal symmetry” which was motivated by

– 11 –

the concept of a space-time uncertainty relation and advocated in ref. [17] 8 in exploring
gauge/gravity correspondences in the cases of dilatonic D-branes and scale non-invariant
super Yang-Mills theories. It indeed played a useful role, for instance, in classifying the
behavior of correlation functions in the context of the light-front Matrix theory in [8].

Corresponding to the invariance of canonical Poisson brackets, we now have a gener-

alized one-dimensional Poincar´e bilinear integral

Because of the above mixing, it is essential to treat the matrix and non-matrix components
of generalized momenta as a single entity, as was the case of generalized coordinates,
except for the trace components of the matrices which do not participate in the above
gauge symmetry.

We stress that except for the Lorentz metric ηµν the metric appearing in the Poisson
bracket, which upon quantization ﬁxes the metric of Hilbert space, is the standard one.
On the other hand, we have to take care of possible dangers of ordinary indeﬁniteness
associated with the Minkowski nature of 11 dimensional target space. With respect to
the center-of-mass motion, the Hamiltonian constraint arising from the variation δe gives
the mass-shell condition, which allows us to express time-like (or light-like) momentum in
terms of spatial components. However, to deal with the time components of the traceless
part of matrix variables, without independent proper times for them, we need further gauge
symmetries as companions to δHL.

2.4 Completion of higher gauge symmetries

One of the reasons why we need still higher gauge symmetries beyond δHL, which already
extended the usual SU(N ) gauge symmetry δH, is that the unphysical gauge degrees of

8The scaling transformation introduced in ref. [17] is obtained from the present deﬁnition if we redeﬁne

M it sounds more natural to interchange the

and then trade oﬀ the scaling X µ

that in view of the signs of the scaling dimensions of X µ

freedom of phase-space pairs of vector-like variables must be at least two for each (traceless)
matrices in order to describe gravity, in analogy with string theory.9 This is necessary for
reproducing the light-front M(atrix) theory which is described by SO(9) vector matrices
and their super partners after an appropriate gauge-ﬁxing. Possibility of such higher gauge
symmetries reveals itself by noticing the existence of two natural conservation laws. We
assume that the whole theory, being deﬁned in the ﬂat 11-dimensional Minkowski space-
time, is symmetric under two rigid translations, namely, the usual coordinate translation
X µ
◦ → X µ
M + bµ in connection with the embedding of
10-dimensional string theory as emphasized already. As the equations of motion, we then
have conservation laws for P µ

We can then consistently demand that P µ
vector and, simultaneously, X µ
to each other,

◦ is a time-like (or light-like as a limiting case)
M is a space-like vector, and ﬁnally that they are orthogonal

P◦ · XM = 0.

(2.38)

Here and in what follows we often denote the Minkowskian scalar products by the “·”
symbol and also use an abbreviation such as X 2
M = XM · XM. Now the above orthogonality
condition allows us to impose a condition on the matrix coordinates in a way that is
invariant under the gauge transformation δHL ˆX µ,

P◦ · ˆX = 0,

(2.39)

which enables us to eliminate the time components of the traceless coordinate matrices.

Since these two constraints are of ﬁrst-class, we can treat them as the Gauss constraints
associated with new gauge symmetries. Corresponding to (2.38) and (2.39), respectively,
the local gauge transformations which preserve the canonical structure are given as

δwX µ

tively, as parameters of gauge transformations. It is to be noted that the other variables
not shown here explicitly are all inert in both cases, and also that the conserved vectors

9Heuristically, the Gauss constraints associated with the gauge ﬁeld B and a new one Z introduced below
will play analogous (in fact much stronger) roles as the non-zero-mode parts of the Virasoro constraints
P 2 + (X ′)2 = 0 and P · X ′ = 0, respectively, of string theory. The zero-mode part of the former Hamiltonian
constraint corresponds to our mass-shell constraint associated with ein-bein e.

CH+L+Y +w = wP◦ · XM + Tr(cid:16)−(P◦ · X)Y + iPµ[H, X µ] + (XM · P )L(cid:17).

We remark that, from the standpoint of the momentum-type variables, the combination
δHY = δH + δY can be regarded as the counterpart of δHL = δH + δL introduced previously
from the standpoint of the coordinate-type variables: in fact, δHY ˆP µ, if expressed in terms
of 3-bracket, is more akin to the original one introduced in [9], in the sense that it uses the
trace P µ

3. Bosonic action

We now have tools at our disposal to construct the action integral. For simplicity, we still
concentrate to the bosonic part in this section. Our basic requirement is that the action
should have symmetries, apart from the requirement of full SO(10,1) Lorentz-Poincar´e
invariance, under all transformations, namely, local τ -reparametrizations, gauge trans-
formations, as well as the global scale transformations and translations, which leave the
canonical structure invariant. Up to total derivatives, unique possibility for the ﬁrst-order

(with respect to derivative) term is the Poincar´e integral (2.57). As the simplest possible
potential term satisfying these requirements, we choose using (2.10),

It is to be noted that the numerical proportional constant in front of the potential is arbi-
trary, since we can always absorb it by making a global rescaling (X µ
M, ρ−1P µ
M),
(B◦, B) → ρ−1(B◦, B) which keeps the the ﬁrst-order term intact.

In order to have non-trivial dynamics, we need at least quadratic kinetic terms, typi-

which however apparently violates gauge symmetry under (2.41). The symmetry can be
recovered by the following procedure, which is analogous to a well known situation in
the covariant ﬁeld theory of a massive vector ﬁeld.10 Namely, we introduce an auxiliary
traceless matrix ﬁeld K transforming simply as

Then, by replacing P µ as P µ → P µ − P µ

this gauge choice is actually equivalent to the following choice of gauge condition

P◦ · ˆP = 0,

Note that we introduce an antisymmetric-tensor ﬁeld Fµν = −Fνµ as an independent variable. The ﬁrst
term as an analogue to our Poincar´e integral is invariant under two independent gauge transformations
2 ǫµναβ(∂αΛβ − ∂βΛα) up to total derivative, while the 2nd and 3rd quadratic
δAµ = ∂µλ and δF µν = 1
terms are not invariant, analogously to Tr(P 2). The equations of motion reduce to (∂2 − m2)Aµ = 0 and
∂µAµ = 0, the latter of which eliminates the negative norm. No inconsistency arises here. The quadratic
terms act partially as gauge-ﬁxing terms for the gauge symmetry of the ﬁrst term precisely as in the system
we are pursuing. As is well known, it is possible to recover the gauge symmetry by introducing further
unphysical degrees of freedom, the so-called Stueckelberg ﬁeld (or the ‘gauge part’ of a Higgs ﬁeld) which
corresponds to our K.

should be kept in mind that ultimately, after taking into account fermionic contribution
to be discussed in the next section, we are interested in states for which the eﬀective
mass-square is of order one in the large N limit.

In order to demonstrate that the above bosonic action has desirable properties as a

covariantized version of Matrix theory, we now check some expected features.

(1) Consistency of the Gauss constraints with the equations of motion

As a ﬁrst exercise, let us see brieﬂy how the Gauss constraints (3.9) and (3.10) are

consistent with the equations of motion,

dτ(cid:0)[X µ, Pµ](cid:1) = i[A, [X µ, Pµ]] + [B, XM · P ],

ensuring the consistency of the Gauss constraints (3.9) and (3.10). The consistency of
(2.38) and (2.39) with the equations of motion can also be easily checked: the conservation
of XM and P µ
◦ ensures the time independence of (2.38), while contracting P◦ µ with (3.15)
gives

d
dτ

(P◦ · ˆX) + ie[A, P◦ · X] − eP◦ · XM ˆB = 0.

(3.17)

One comment relevant here is that the dynamical role of the M-momentum P µ

M is to
lead the conservation of X µ
M, and that it does not participate in the dynamics of this system
actively, since there is no kinetic term for it. Its behavior is determined by the equation of
motion in terms of the other variables in a completely passive manner as

DP µ

(3.18)

where we denoted the potential term in the action by −V. Note that the center-of-mass
coordinate X µ
◦ is also of passive nature, similarly, leading to the conservation of the center-
of-mass momentum, and that its time derivative is expressed entirely in terms of the other
variables. In other words, both these variables are “cyclic” variables using the terminology
of analytical mechanics.

(2) Light-front and time-like gauge ﬁxings

As a next check, let us demonstrate that this system reduces to the bosonic part of light-
front Matrix theory after an appropriate gauge ﬁxing together with the condition of com-
pactiﬁcation. Without losing generality, we ﬁrst choose a two-dimensional (Minkowskian)
plane spanned by two conserved vectors P µ
M and introduce the light-front coordi-
nates (P ±
M) foliating this plane. For convenience, we
call this plane “M-plane”. Note that due to the space-like nature of X µ
M together with
the constraint (2.38), both of its light-front components X ±
M are non-vanishing, while by
deﬁnition two conserved vectors P µ
M have no transverse components orthogonal to
the M-plane. We can then choose the gauge using the δL-gauge symmetry such that

M ≡ X 10

that such deformed transformation laws are necessarily diﬀerent from those expected from

Remarks

(i) One of the novel characteristics in our model is that the 11 dimensional Planck
length ℓ11 emerges as the expectation value (3.27) of an invariant X 2
M, arising out of a
completely scale-free theory. Together with a compactiﬁed unit R11 (or R) of momen-
tum, they provide two independent constants gs and ℓs of string theory embedded in 11
dimensions. This emerges once we specify a particular solution for P µ
M as initial
conditions through these conserved quantities. However, the meaning of the Lorentz in-
variant X 2

time-evolution of traceless matrix variables in a Lorentz-invariant manner, while the latter
only speciﬁes the initial values of center-of-mass momentum which is essentially decoupled
from the dynamics of the traceless matrix part. It seems natural to postulate that the in-
variant X 2
M deﬁnes a super-selection rule with respect to the scale symmetry of our system.
In other words, we demand that no superposition is allowed among states with diﬀerent
values of X 2
M. Due to the scale symmetry, any pair of diﬀerent sectors of the Hilbert space
(after quantization) can be mapped into each other by an appropriate scale transformation,
and then all the diﬀerent super-selection sectors describe completely the same dynamics.
In this sense, the scale symmetry is spontaneously broken. Such a fundamental nature of 11
dimensional gravitational length is also one of the expected general properties of M-theory.

(ii) The fact that the system is reducible from 11 (10 spatial and 1 time-like) matrix
degrees of freedom to 9 spatial matrix degrees of freedom is of course due to the presence
of the higher gauge symmetries. From the viewpoint of ordinary relativistic mechanics
of many particles, this feature is also quite a peculiar phenomenon: our higher gauge
symmetries imply that two space-time directions corresponding to the M-plane are locally
unobservable with respect to the dynamics of M-theory partons. That is the reason why
we can eliminate both of the traceless parts, ˆX ± and ˆP ± of the matrix degrees of free-

of this term conforms to, at least qualitatively, one remarkable aspect of general-relativistic
interactions of M-theory partons. Due to the elimination of ˆX −, the static diagonal ma-
trices (with ˆP i = 0 and [Xi, Xj] = 0) for all directions transverse to the plane spanned

X −, as a passive variable which does not participate in the dynamics, in terms of transverse variables. In
contrast, in our model, we can eliminate the traceless part ˆX −, and thus our higher gauge symmetries
play a much stronger role than the re-parametrization invariance in string and membrane theories. The
possibility of diﬀerent formulations which are more analogous to strings and membrane might be worthwhile
to pursue. However, that would require a framework which is diﬀerent from the present paper.

is also a consequence of the structure of our 3-bracket. In classical particle pictures, this
corresponds to bundles of parallel (and collinear as a special degenerate limit) trajectories
of 11 dimensional gravitons. On the other hand, in classical general relativity, it is well
known that the parallel pencil-like trajectories of massless particles are non-interacting:
equivalently, for the metric of the form

ds2 = dxµdxµ + h−−(dx−)2

(3.45)

with coordinate condition ∂+h−− = 0, the vacuum Einstein equations reduce to the linear
Laplace equation ∂2
i h−− = 0 in the transverse space around such trajectories [18]. This
makes possible the interpretation of states with higher quantized momenta P +
◦ as compos-
ite states consisting of constituent states with unit momentum 1/R along the compactiﬁed
direction. Note that in ordinary local theories of point-like particles, a state of a single
particle with multiple units of momentum and a state of many particles of the same to-
tal momentum but with various diﬀerent distributions of constitutent’s momenta must be
treated as diﬀerent states which can be discriminated by relative positions in the coordi-
nate representation. In contrast to this, our higher gauge symmetries render the relative
positions along the x− directions unobservable as unphysical degrees of freedom.

(iii) As regards classical solutions with diagonal transverse degrees of matrices, there
is another curious property for non-static solutions with constant non-zero velocities for
ﬁnite N . The action (3.41) in the time-like gauge shows that the upper bound for the
magnitude of transverse relative velocities is described by

N ≥ Tr(cid:16) D ˆXi

D ˆXi

Dt (cid:17) ⇒

(3.46)

For diagonal conﬁgurations with SO(9) rotation symmetry, this bound corresponds to the
usual relativistic bound v ≤ c = 1 in terms of absolute (not relative) velocities. On the
other hand, for non-symmetrical conﬁgurations, this, being a bound averaged over relative
velocities of constituent partons and the oﬀ-diagonal degrees of freedom, does not forbid
the appearance of super-luminal velocities for a part of constituent partons, when other
partons have sub-luminal (or zero) velocities provided N ≥ 3. This situation is owing to
the absence of the mass-shell conditions set independently for each parton, and is actually
expected in any covariantized extensions of the light-front super quantum mechanics, which
itself has no such condition,14 as we have already mentioned in the Introduction. Note,
14For the system of a single particle as exempliﬁed in the Introduction, the relativistic upper bound is
automatically built-in, due to the mass-shell condition. The problem only appears for many-body systems
when the mass-shell condition for each particle-degree of freedom is not independently imposed. For compar-
ison, if we consider a system of N free massive particles designated by a = 1, 2, . . . N and impose mass-shell
condition for each particle, the usual relativistic upper bound |v(a)

mentum is time-like. In terms of independent light-front times x+ (a), the bounds are (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

and hence there is no restriction on the magnitude for transverse velocities, as the right-hand side can

4. Fermionic degrees of freedom and supersymmetry

Our next task is to extend foregoing constructions to a supersymmetric theory. Since we
already know a supersymmetric version reduced to the light-front gauge with the DLCQ
compactiﬁcation, all we need is to ﬁnd a way of reformulating it in terms of appropri-
ate languages which ﬁt consisitently to the structure of the previous bosonic part without
violating covariance in the sense of 11 dimensional Minkowski space-time and other symme-
tries. Corresponding to the traceless part of the bosonic matrices, we introduce Majonara
spinor Hermitian traceless matrices denoted by Θ. By this, we mean that all the would-
be real components of matrix elements are Majonara spinors with 32 components.15 The
Dirac conjugate is deﬁned by ¯Θab = ΘT
abΓ0 where the transposition symbol T is with resect
to spinor components treated as column and row vectors; but we mostly suppress the T-
symbol on Θ below, because it must be obvious by the position of Gamma matrices acting
on them.

To be a supersymmetric theory, we also need the fermionic partner for the center-of-
mass degrees of bosonic variables. The fermionic center-of-mass degrees of freedom, being
a single 32 component Majorana spinor, are denoted by Θ◦ with the subscript ◦ as in
the bosonic case. Unlike bosonic case, the relative normalization between the traceless
fermion matrices and Θ◦ can be chosen arbitrarily since it is completely decoupled from
the dynamics of the traceless matrices. We therefore treat the fermionic matrices Θ always
as traceless, being completely separated from the center-of-mass fermionic variables Θ◦.16
Note that in the bosonic case, the center-of-mass motion couples with the traceless part
through the Hamiltonian constraint, although their equations of motion are decoupled.
Under the τ -reparametrization, both Θ◦ and Θ transform as scalar.

We aim at a minimally possible extension of the light-front Matrix theory. A funda-
mental premise in what follows is that for fermionic variables, there is no counterpart of
the bosonic M-variables, a canonical (non-matrix) pair (X µ
M). This requires that the
Gauss constraints (2.38) and (3.10) involving them must themselves be invariant under su-
persymmetry transformations. This will be achieved by requiring that the center-of-mass
momentum P µ
◦ is super invariant, and consequently the Gauss constraint (2.39) should also
be super invariant. To be consistent with these demands, the fermionic variables are not

M, P µ

subject to gauge transformations except for δHLΘ = δHY Θ = δHΘ = (0, iPr[F r, Gr, Θ]),

which is reduced simply only to the usual SU(N ) gauge transformation corresponding to
the gauge ﬁeld A,

δH Θ = i[H, Θ].

(4.1)

15The Dirac matrices Γµ are in the Majonara real representation where all components are real numbers,
and {Γµ, Γν} = 2ηµν , (Γµ)T = Γ0ΓµΓ0, and Γµ1µ2...µn is a totally anti-symmetrized product of n matrices,
so that (Γ0Γµ1µ2...µn )T = (−1)n−1Γ0Γµnµn−1...µ1 .

16For notational brevity, we drop the symbol “ ˆ ” for fermionic matrices, as for other bosonic variables

such as A, B, Z which are deﬁned as traceless from the beginning.

– 24 –

Consequently the usual traces of the products of fermion matrices give gauge invariants,
provided they do not involve bosonic matrix variables, while the products involving both
fermionic and bosonic matrices can be made invariant by combining them into 3-brackets,
just as in the case of purely bosonic cases. Since the fermionic variables intrinsically obey
the ﬁrst-order formalism in which the generalized coordinates and momenta are mixed
inextricably among spinor components and hence the fermionic generalized coordinates and
momenta should have the same transformation laws, it would be very diﬃcult to extend the
structure of higher-gauge transformations for the bosonic variables to fermionic variables
covariantly if we assumed non-zero fermionic M-variables. But that is not necessary as we
shall argue below.

4.1 Center-of-mass part: 11 dimensional rigid supersymmetry

Let us now start from the center-of-mass degrees of freedom. Since we require that the
theory has at least 11 dimensional rigid supersymmetry, it is natural to set the center-of-
mass part in a standard fashion as for the case of a single point particle. Thus the fermionic
action is chosen to be

which is obtained by making a replacement dX µ

which is consistent with the ﬁrst order equations of motion.

Under the assumption that all the other variables not exhibited above are inert with
respect to the rigid super transformation, it is clear that the existence of these fermionic
center-of-mass degrees of freedom does not spoil any of symmetry properties introduced
in previous sections, provided that the remaining matrix part of the action decouples from

M. This ensures that the ﬁrst-order equations of motion for the canonical

(4.10)

where the unspeciﬁed functions f µ and gµ are contributions from the remaining part of
action and do not depend on these passive variables themselves. It should also be mentioned
that the scale dimensions of the fermion center-of-mass variables are

Θ◦ → λ1/2Θ◦,

ε → λ1/2ε.

The equation of motion for the fermionic center-of-mass spinor is then

(4.12)

For generic case with non-vanishing eﬀective mass square −P 2
vation law

◦ > 0, this leads to a conser-

dΘ◦
dτ

= 0.

(4.13)

In general, the quantum states consist of fundamental massive super-multiplets of dimen-
sion 216.

We here brieﬂy touch the canonical structure of the fermionic center-of-mass variables.

From the above action, there is a primary second-class constraint,

satisfying a Poisson bracket relation

Π◦ + ¯ΘP◦ · Γ = 0,

{Π◦ α + ( ¯ΘP◦ · Γ)α, Π◦ β + ( ¯ΘP◦ · Γ)β}P = 2(Γ0P◦ · Γ)αβ,

(4.14)

(4.15)

where Π◦ is canonically conjugate to Θ◦ and α, β, . . . are spinor indices. Correspondingly,
the Poisson bracket must be replaced by Dirac bracket, which is also required to render
the canonical structure supersymmetric. We give a brief account of this topic in appendix
A.

In the limit of light-like center-of-mass momentum P 2

◦ = 0, a one-half of the primary
constraints (4.14) becomes ﬁrst class because of the existence of zero eigenvalues for the
Dirac operator P◦ · Γ, and the fermionic equations of motion have a redundancy. In the
present work, we will not elaborate on remedying this complication, by assuming generic
massive case. Physically, this is allowed since the system, describing a general many-body

– 26 –

system with massless gravitons, has continuous mass spectrum without mass gap. When we
have to deal with the light-like case, we can always consider a slightly diﬀerent state with
a small but non-zero center-of-mass by adding soft gravitons propagating with a non-zero
small momentum along directions transverse to the original states.

As is well known, the singularity at P 2

◦ = 0 is associated with the emergence of a local

symmetry, called Siegel (or “κ”-) symmetry [19],

δκΘ◦ = P◦ · Γκ,

δκX µ

◦ = − ¯Θ◦ΓµδκΘ◦,

(4.16)

with arbitrary spinor function κ(τ ).17 This allows us to eliminate a half of components
of Θ◦ by a suitable redeﬁnition of X µ
◦ , and hence the super-multiplets are shorten to
216/2 = 28 = 256 dimensions (or to half-BPS states). This coincides with the dimension
of graviton super-multiplet in 11 dimensions which constitutes the basic physical ﬁeld-
degrees of freedom of 11 dimensional supergravity.
It should be noted, however, that
generic many-body states with time-like center-of-mass momenta composed of massless
short multiplets obey “longer” massive representations. For instance, a generic two-body
◦ > 0 would constitute a massive multiplet of 28×28 =
scattering state of gravitons with −P 2
216 dimensions. Therefore, it does not seem reasonable to demand a κ-symmetry as a
general condition in our case of the center-of-mass supersymmetry, since we are dealing
with N = 1 supersymmetry in the highest 11 dimensions.18

4.2 Traceless matrix part: dynamical supersymmetry

Next, we proceed to the traceless matrix part. A natural candidate for the transformation
law of the bosonic matrices is

δǫ ˆX µ = ¯ǫΓµΘ.

(4.17)

Superﬁcially the previous transformation (4.5) may be regarded as the trace part of this
form, but we will shortly see critical diﬀerences. To keep the diﬀerence in mind, the
spinor parameter is now denoted by a symbol ǫ which is distinct from that (ε) for the
center-of-mass degrees of freedom, since they are in principle independent of each other
and can be treated separately. This is natural, since the traceless matrices describe the
internal dynamics of relative degrees of freedom. Following common usage, we call the rigid
supersymmetry of the center-of-mass part “kinematical” which is essentially a superspace
translation as a partner of rigid space-time translation, and that of the traceless part

17The action is invariant, under the condition M2 = 0, by adjoining the transformation of ein-bain
dτ κ. Of course, the expression of the eﬀective mass square is to be extended by including the

δκe = −4 d ¯Θ◦
contribution of traceless fermionic matrices, as discussed below.

18Note that the situation is diﬀerent for a single supermembrane in 11 dimensions, where the ground state
is required to be a massless graviton supermultiplet. It is also to be mentioned that in lower space-time
dimensions the κ-symmetry can be generalized to massive case when we have an extended supersymmetry
with non-vanishing central charges. See e.g. [20]. This is consistent with the fact that such systems can
be obtained by dimensional reduction from massless theories of higher dimensions, by which massive states
can constitute a short multiplet with respect to extended supersymmetries.

– 27 –

“dynamical”, mixing between the bosonic and fermionic traceless matrices without any
inhomogeneous shift-type contributions. The dynamical supersymmetry of our system will
be related to rigid translations with respect to the invariant time parameter s (ds = edτ ).
Once these two independent supersymmetries are established, however, we can combine
them depending on diﬀerent situations. For instance, we can partially identify ǫ and ε up
to some proportional factor and projection (or twisting) conditions with respect to spinor
indices. That would occur through an identiﬁcation of the invariant proper-time parameter
with an external time coordinate as a gauge choice for re-parametrization invariance, as in
the case of the usual formulation of the light-front Matrix theory.

(1) Projection conditions

◦ and X µ

In discussing the transformation law for Θ, we have to take into account the existence
of the Gauss constraint (2.38) which characterizes the M-plane. We treat this constraint
as a strong constraint in studying dynamical supersymmetry. This is allowed, as long as
Lorentz covariance is not lost. We then have to assume the equations of motion for the
center-of-mass part and for the M-variables strongly, so that we can use the conservation
laws of P µ
M against
dynamical as well as kinematical super transformations. We do not expect any diﬃculty
with this restriction at least practically: for example, we can use the representation where
both of these vectors are diagonalized for quantization. Thus it should be kept in mind
that the supersymmetry transformation laws derived below have validity only “on shell”
with respect to these variables. With respect to the traceless matrix part, on the other
hand, they will be valid without using the equations of motion.

M, both of which are assumed to be inert δǫP µ

◦ = 0 = δǫX µ

Now we have to examine the compatibility of the other Gauss constraints (2.39) and
(3.10) with dynamical supersymmetry. Our assumptions, with the dynamical super trans-
formation (4.17), requires that δǫ(P◦ · ˆX) = 0, namely,

It is also necessary to demand δǫ(XM · ˆP ) = 0 for the momentum as

¯ǫP◦ · ΓΘ = 0.

XM · δǫ ˆP = 0.

(4.18)

(4.19)

We ﬁrst concentrate on the former. In any natural decomposition between generalized co-
ordinates and momenta for the spinor components of Θ, this is a second-class constraint.
This suggests that the traceless spinor matrix and parameter ǫ should obey certain projec-
tion condition strongly, rather than as a Gauss constraint associated with gauge symmetry,
such that (4.18) is obeyed. By the existence of two conserved vectors P µ
M which
are orthogonal to each other due to the strong constraint (2.38), we have a candidate for
Lorentz-invariant (real) projector:

We then introduce the projection condition by Γ◦ΓMΘ = −Θ, namely,

P−Θ = Θ, P+Θ = 0,

(or

equivalently

¯ΘP+ = ¯Θ, ¯ΘP− = 0)

(4.27)

together with the opposite projection on ǫ,

P+ǫ = ǫ, P−ǫ = 0,

(or

equivalently ¯ǫP− = ¯ǫ, ¯ǫP+ = 0).

(4.28)

Then as desired

¯ǫP◦ · ΓΘ = ¯ǫP−(P◦ · Γ)P−Θ = ¯ǫ(P◦ · Γ)P+P−Θ = 0,

and simultaneously we also have,

¯ǫXM · ΓΘ = ¯ǫP−(XM · Γ)P−Θ = ¯ǫXM · ΓP+P−Θ = 0,

while

¯ǫΓiΘ = ¯ǫP−ΓiP−Θ = ¯ǫΓiP−Θ = ¯ǫP−ΓiΘ

(4.31)

can be non-vanishing for all i’s, transverse to both P◦ and XM. The dynamical supersym-
metry is thus eﬀective essentially in the directions which are transverse to the M-plane, in
conformity with our requirement. This automatically ensures the remaining requirement
(4.19), as we will conﬁrm later.

It is to be noted that the condition (4.27) is equivalent to

(Γ◦ − ΓM)Θ = 0,

(4.32)

In the classical theory of a single supermembrane, the possibility of a similar projection
owes to the existence of the κ-symmetry.
In our system, by contrast, the existence of
the gauge-invariant Gauss constraints in the bosonic sector, involving dynamical variables
without fermionic partners, requires us, on our premise of a minimal extension, necessarily
to introduce projection condition for fermionic variables in a Lorentz-covariant and gauge-
invariant manner. Thus our strategy can be diﬀerent20: we need not bother about possible
imposition of a generalized κ-like symmetry for traceless matrix variables. The dynamical
supersymmetry requires that the physical degrees of freedom of traceless matrices match
between bosonic and fermionic variables. On the bosonic side, the number of physical de-
grees of freedom after imposing all contraints is 8, counting the pairs of canonical variables,
if we take into account all of the Gauss constraints including the A-gauge symmetry. The
number of physical degrees of freedom for the fermionic traceless matrices must therefore
be 16, and this was made possible by our covariant projection condition (4.27) as a part-
ner of the bosonic constraints represented by the set of Gauss constraints, thanks to the
existence of the M-variables.

(2) Fermion action and dynamical supersymmetry transformations

We are now ready to present the fermionic part of the action and supersymmetry
transformations. The total fermionic contribution to be added to the bosonic action (3.6)
is

MTr(cid:0) ¯ΘΓ◦Γi[Xi, Θ](cid:1) = 2qX 2

MTr(cid:0) ¯ΘΓ◦Γµ[X µ, Θ](cid:1),

due to the projection condition21 and the fact that no M-variables are associated with
fermionic matrices. A consequence of this is that, due to the fermion projection condition,
(4.35) depends on the coordinate matrices only of directions transverse to the M-plane.

20This does not exclude the possibility of introducing the fermionic partner even for the M-variables
in conjunction with some higher fermionic gauge symmetries. It does not seem however that elaboration
toward such a non-minimal extension is practically useful.

21Note that (cid:10) ¯Θ, Γµν [X µ, X ν , Θ](cid:11) = 2Tr(cid:0) ¯ΘΓµνX µ

M[X ν , Θ](cid:1), which is rewritten as (4.35) using ΓMΘ =

It is to be noted here that the traceless fermion matrices have zero scaling dimensions,
with the dimension of ǫ being 1 correspondingly, in contrast to the case of center-of-mass
fermion variables Θ◦ and ε whose scale dimensions are both 1/2. This convention is con-
venient here to simplify some of the expressions,22 and no inconsistency arises as noticed
before, since there is no coupling between Θ◦ and Θ, and the kinematical supersymme-
try transformation of the latter can be discussed independently of the former dynamical
supersymmetry.

The dynamical supersymmetry transformations for matrix variables are, with the pro-
jection conditions (4.27), (4.28) and the Gauss constraint (2.38) for the δw-gauge symmetry,

It is easy to check that due to our projection condition, (4.19) is satisﬁed as promised before.
Remember again that, as we have emphasized, the equations of motion for the center-of-
mass variables and the M-variables, especially conservation laws of P µ
M which are
completely inert against supersymmetry transformations as well as gauge transformaionts,
are assumed here. On the other hand, the behavior of their conjugates, namely the passive
variables, are ﬁxed by the ﬁrst order equations of motion. It is also to be noted that these
transformation laws are independent of the ein-bein e. This implies that the part of the
action involving τ -derivatives and the remaining part (essentially Hamiltonian H) including
contributions with gauge ﬁelds, which does not involve the τ -derivatives being proportional
to the ein-bein e are separately invariant under the supersymmetry transformations. This
is one of the merits of the ﬁrst-order formalism. A derivation of these results will be found
in appendix B.

◦ and X µ

In order to express the properties of these transformation laws from the viewpoint of
canonical formalism, we need Dirac bracket. With Π being the canonical conjugate to Θ,
the primary second-class constraint for the traceless fermion matrices is

which is the covariantized version of the supersymmetry algebra (with ﬁnite N ) in the usual
light-front formulation. Note that the second line of (4.53) represents a ﬁeld-dependent A-
gauge transformation, reﬂecting the fact that the dynamical supersymmetry transformation
intrinsically involves an A-gauge transformation. Thus, up to a ﬁeld-dependent gauge
transformation, the commutator [δǫ1, δǫ2] induces an inﬁnitesimal translation with respect
to the invariant time parameter s,

s → s − 2¯ǫ1Γ◦ǫ2.

sponding to the δHL-gauge symmetry are

equation of motion in the K = 0 gauge, respectively,

GZ ≡ P◦ · ˆX = 0, P◦ · ˆP = 0,

(4.59)

in addition to the other Gauss constraints. As stressed already in the treatment of the
bosonic part, the mass-shell condition must be understood in conjunction with these Gauss
constraints. The Gauss constraints together with the K equations of motion are themselves
invariant under the dynamical supersymmetry,

δǫGA = 0,

δǫGB = 0,

δǫGZ = 0,

δǫ(P◦ · ˆP ) = 0.

(4.60)

On the other hand, M2 itself is not super invariant, but the following combination
which involves gauge ﬁelds and corresponds to the total Hamiltonian H of our system is
invariant:

δǫ(cid:16) 1
eH(cid:17) = δǫ(cid:16)Tr(AGA − ˆBGB + ZGZ ) −

2N M2(cid:17) = 0,

(4.61)

since δǫP µ
◦ = 0, as we have already stressed before. Thus, the supersymmetry of the
eﬀective mass square is satisﬁed only after imposing the Gauss constraints ensuring the
consistency of our formalism. The same can be said concerning the positivity of the eﬀective
mass square M2, since the closure of the supersymmetry algebra (4.53) is also ensured in
conjunction with those Gauss constraints.

Finally, we derive the full eﬀective action in the light-front gauge using the light-

5. Concluding remarks

We have proposed a consistent re-formulation of Matrix theory with 11 dimensional Lorentz
covariance, as an intermediate step toward ultimate formulation of M-theory. We have not,
needless to say, proved the uniqueness of our construction. Possibilities to deform or extend
our formulation by modifying or relaxing some of the symmetry requirements or by adding
higher order terms for the potential and kinetic terms are not excluded.
In connection
with this, we stress again that our standpoint toward covariantized Matrix theory on the
basis of the DLCQ interpretation for ﬁnite N is not based on the naive analogies with
the structure of supermembrane action, which were mentioned in section 1 as a heuristic
motivation for discretized Nambu bracket. For example, from the classical dynamics of
supermembranes, there is no immediate analog for the M-variables, being responsible for
the scale invariance and covariant projection conditions as well as the crucial higher gauge
symmetries in our model.

To conclude, we brieﬂy mention some important issues unsolved or untouched in the

present work.
(1) We have not examined whether our covariant reformulation of Matrix theory is useful
for discussing various possible bound states of M-theory partons, especially in the limit of
inﬁnite N . It remains to see whether 11 dimensional coordinate matrices together with the
M-variables can provide any new insight for representing various currents and conserved
charges if we treat all components of the matrices in a manifestly covariant fashion.
(2) The problem of covariant formulation of currents is closely related to the problem of
background dependence. Our formulation is consistent on the completely ﬂat Minkowski
background. However, it is not at all obvious how to deform the theory to curved back-
grounds, since the theory is intrinsically non-local and satisﬁes novel gauge symmetries.
Unlike the light-front formulation, the analogy with super membranes does not work either.
For these reasons, it is not straightforward to deﬁne energy-momentum tensor and other
currents in our framework.26 Most probably, the higher gauge transformations themselves
are deformed or extended further in the presence of non-trivial backgrounds. The prob-
lem is also related to the fundamental issue of background independence of Matrix theory,
which is expected to be resolved only when the theory is treated fully quantum mechani-
cally, because the interactions among the actual gravitational degrees of freedom can only
emerge as loop eﬀects (see [6] for a review on this subject).
(3) In the present paper, we have restricted ourselves essentially to classical theory. Since
we have already given the whole structure in the setting of ﬁrst-order canonical formalism,
it would be relatively straightforward, at least formally, to formulate fully covariant and
BRST invariant quantizations of our theory both in path-integral and operator methods.

26Here possible connection of our approach to the super-embedding approach (see e.g. [14] and references
therein) may be worthwhile to pursue, since such a geometrical approach seems useful in clarifying the
relation at least with classical 11-dimensional supergravity. Note however that it is not at all clear how
such classical structure could be related the generation of non-linear gravitational interactions through the
quantum eﬀects of matrices, as demonstrated for instance in [25] and references therein. For bridging them,
something analogous to the renormalization group approach to world-sheet conformal symmetry in string
theory, is desirable.

– 35 –

If we adopt the gauge conditions involving τ -derivatives of the gauge ﬁelds, we can treat
them as unphysical propagating ﬁelds together with the vector matrix ﬁelds and ghost
ﬁelds. That would be useful, for example, in applying our formalism to study scattering
amplitudes and correlation functions, in addition to the problems related to the issue (1)
and (2), although we have to be very careful about the validity of perturbative methods.

(4) A problem of diﬀerent nature is whether our methods can be extended to a covariantiza-
tion of matrix string theory [22], in the sense of SO(9,1) Lorentz symmetry in 10 dimensions
with small gs. The matrix string theory can be regarded as a diﬀerent but equally possible
matrix regularization [23] of classical membrane theory, when the membranes are wrapped
around the M-theory circle. It should in principle be possible to extend our covariantized
Matrix theory by suitably reformulating the procedure of compactiﬁcation with windings.
We have to, however, ﬁnd a way of reformulating Virasoro conditions such that they cor-
respond to the Gauss constraints of some higher gauge symmetries associated with matrix
variables, in analogy with our higher gauge symmetries. It would provide us a new theory
of covariant second-quantized strings, diﬀering from the standard approach of string ﬁeld
theories.

(5) Another fundamental issue confronting us is to include anti D-particles. To do this
satisfactorily requires us to treat the size of matrices as a genuine dynamical variable, in
order to describe creation and annihilation of brane-anti-brane pairs as dynamical processes.
That would also improve somewhat ad hoc nature of relating the light-like momentum P +
and the size of the matrices in the present formulation. In particular, the higher gauge
symmetry must include SU(N )×SU(M ) with varying N and M . In other words, the theory
must be formulated in a Fock space with respect to the sizes of matrices. This seems to be
a notoriously diﬃcult problem, perhaps forcing us to invent a new theoretical framework.
For a tentative attempt related to this problem, see ref. [24].

A. Dirac brackets for the center-of-mass part

Let us present two alternative versions of Dirac brackets, depending upon whether (a) we
treat the orthogonality Gauss constraint (2.38) as a weak constraint imposed after com-
puting brackets, or (b) as a strong constraint taking into account (2.38) by appropriately
ﬁxing the δw-gauge symmetry.

If we use the second version (b) of
the Dirac bracket, Γµ is replaced by ˜Γµ. This is due to the fact that the gauge-ﬁxing
condition is not invariant against supersymmetry transformation, and hence we have to
perform a compensating gauge transformation together with a (ﬁeld-dependent) δw-gauge
transformations in recovering the gauge condition. Finally, using (A.13), it is easy to check
that the M-variables are inert under the super transformations.

B. Derivation of dynamical supersymmetry transformations

(1) Transformation laws

Since our formulation is completely covariant under 11 dimensional Lorentz trans-
formations, we are free to use an arbitrary Lorentz frame to study supersymmetry. A
convenient frame for this purpose is such that only non-zero component of P µ
◦ is the time
component P 0
M . By making a boost along
the 10-th spatial direction in terms of the usual light-front foliation this is alway possible:
this frame is characterized by P +
M due to (3.44). In this frame
the projection condition for fermionic variables become the ordinary light-like condition,

◦ , assuming a time-like P◦, and that of X µ

◦ and hence X +

◦ = −P −

M is X 10

M = X −

(Γ0 − Γ10)Θ = 0,

(Γ0 + Γ10)ǫ = 0.

Now, by re-deﬁnining the gauge ﬁeld B as

It should be kept in mind that we dropped the part involving the center-of-mass variables

M these part of the action behaves as a total derivative. As emphasized in the text,
we treat this reduced action together with the equations of motion for these variables,
with the Gauss constraint P◦ · XM = 0 being strongly imposed. Apart from the terms
in the ﬁrst line, the reduced action shown in the second line is formally the same as the
bosonic part of the action for the ordinary supersymmetric quantum mechanics expressed
in the ﬁrst-order formalism. Note however that the 11 dimensional covariance is not at all
lost in this process: using covariant language, non-covariant looking expressions should be
understood, together with (2.38) and (2.39), as

satisfying covariant orthogonality conditions,

P◦ · ˆX = 0, P◦ · ˆP = 0, XM · ˆX = 0, XM · ˆP = 0.

We now study the fermionic part of the action on the basis of the requirement of
supersymmetry, with understanding that all the fermion variables below are projected as
discussed in section 4. Since we are using somewhat unfamiliar ﬁrst-order formalism, we
start from scratch. First, the kinetic term is chosen to be

Comparing with the center-of-mass case, this amounts to a change of the normalization of
traceless part by Θ → (−P 2

dimensions of Θ and ǫ to zero and 1, respectively. The change due to the transformation

It is to be noted that in deriving (B.23) use was made of the Jacobi identity, which amounts
to the Fundamental Identity (2.2) in terms of the original 3-bracket notation for the po-
tential terms.

There remain the contributions of 3rd-order with respect to the fermion matrices, one
of which is the fermionic potential term substituted by δǫ ˆXi and another comes from the
fermion kinetic term substituted by (B.14). The cancellation of the sum of these two terms
is ensured by a well-known identity for the 11 dimensional Dirac matrices,

Tr(cid:0)Θa{Θb, Θc}(cid:1)ǫd(Γµ)(ac(Γ0Γµ)bd) = 0

(B.25)

where the spinor indices are totally symmetrized. Taking into account the projection con-
ditions and the symmetry properties of the 11 dimensional Dirac matrices in the Majorana
representation, this identity can be reduced to

1
2

Tr(cid:0)Θa{Θb, Θc}(cid:1)ǫd(Γi)ac(Γ0Γi)bd +

Tr(cid:0)Θa{Θb, Θc}(cid:1)ǫd(Γ0)adδbc = 0,

in which the ﬁrst and the second term on the left-hand side correspond, respectively, to
the former and latter contributions of 3rd order.

Now we have to go back to the redeﬁnitions, (B.2) and (B.3). Since our derivation
was made under the presumption δǫB′ = 0 and δǫZ′ = 0, the transformations of the gauge
ﬁelds B and Z are determined as

δǫB = i(X 2

It is to be noted, as one of the merits of our ﬁrst-order formalism, that the supersymmetry
is actually valid for the derivative part and the remaining part proportional to the ein-bein
e separately, corresponding to the fact that the transformation laws themselves do not
involve e explicitly.

◦ and X µ

As we have stressed, the super transformation laws derived above are valid under
the conservation laws of P µ
M with the Gauss constraint (2.38) being imposed
strongly. The cyclic variabels X µ
M corresponding to them are passively determined
by integrating their ﬁrst-order equations of motion. The following general argument shows
that transformation laws for them can also be expressed locally in terms of the variation of
supercharges with respect to their conjugate variables, on-shell after using the equations of
motion and the Gauss constraints for other non-cyclic variables including matrix variables.
The equations of motion for cyclic variables O in general take the form

∂ ˜O ≡ {O,H}D

(B.35)

with (O, ˜O) being a canonical pair of cyclic variables up to a sign, and H is the Hamiltonian,
the part of the Lagrangian which is proportional to the ein-bein e and, by the deﬁnition of

– 42 –

◦ and for O = P µ
the cyclic variables, does not involve O. For example, for O = X µ
M,
˜O = −X µ
M. Though we used notations with ordinary derivatives for the purpose of making
the concepts clear, it should be kept in mind that the derivatives with respect to canonical
variables here and in what follows are to be deﬁned through appropriate Dirac bracket as
indicated by the equality ≡. Under the Gauss constraints which are themselves invariant
under supersymmetry transformations, the supersymmetry of the action is equivalent to

◦ , ˜O = P µ

This leads to

{¯ǫQ,H}D = 0.

∂Q

∂H
∂ ˜O }D = 0.

(B.36)

(B.37)

Since H is completely independent of O, the super transformation of (B.35) directly gives
the time derivative of the super transformation of passive variable as

δǫO = −¯ǫ

∂Q
∂ ˜O ≡ ¯ǫ{O,Q}D.

(B.38)

(B.39)

For the validity of this argument, we have to deﬁne the Dirac bracket appropriately by
taking into account the gauge-ﬁxing conditions in order to treat the Gauss constraints
strongly. In the present paper, we do not elaborate further along this line.

(3) The equations of motion for matrix variables

As an example of checking the dynamical super transformation laws, let us conﬁrm
consistency with the equations of motion in a simplest case: the ﬁrst order equation of
motion for bosonic variables, including the Gauss constraint of the δY -gauge symmetry,

case is somewhat more cumbersome than above, we can check similarly that the super-
transformations of both sides matches on using the fermion equations of motion. The
simplest way of doing this is to use the special frame introduced in (1).
