Abstract

We discuss the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect in the presence of hidden photons kinetically
mixed with the ordinary electromagnetic photons. The hidden photon ﬁeld causes a
slight phase shift in the observable interference pattern.
It is then shown how the
limited sensitivity of this experiment can be largely improved. The key observation is
that the hidden photon ﬁeld causes a leakage of the ordinary magnetic ﬁeld into the
supposedly ﬁeld-free region. The direct measurement of this magnetic ﬁeld can provide
a sensitive experiment with a good discovery potential, particularly below the ∼ meV
mass range for hidden photons.

Introduction

Astrophysical and cosmological observations give clear evidence that 95% of the Universe is
made out of substances not represented in the Standard Model. Yet, again and again the
Standard Model persists in experimental tests and new physics remains elusive.

One possible explanation, of why new physics is so elusive is that it could reside in a
so-called hidden sector, that couples only very weakly with Standard Model particles and
therefore with our experiments.
In this case new particles do not need to be heavy to
evade detection. Thus, they would not be found by experimental eﬀorts that concentrate
on higher and higher energies. Instead, to probe such hidden sectors one needs new, very
precise experiments.

Besides the purely phenomenological argument that hidden sectors are a good way to
“hide” the new physics, theoretical model building also provides motivation for their exis-
tence.
Indeed, hidden sectors are a common feature of many proposed extensions to the
Standard Model. One of the simplest versions of a hidden sector is an extra U(1) gauge
degree of freedom, dubbed hidden photon (sometimes paraphoton, dark photon, etc.) [1].
Remarkably, such a new gauge boson can also be a suitable dark matter candidate [2–4].
Therefore, this has become a popular test-case [5–7]. Small interactions between hidden
photons and the Standard Model particles are most easily realized via kinetic mixing be-
tween the hidden photon and the ordinary photon [8–10], which quite naturally arises in
ﬁeld theory via loop interactions of heavy messengers or similar eﬀects in string theory. We
will review the main properties of this type of interaction in Sect. 2.

Several experiments constrain the parameter space of hidden photons and many dedi-
cated searches are running or planned for the future (see Refs. [7, 11, 12] for recent reviews).
However, since both the mass (m) and the coupling () are a priori unknown, a wide pa-
rameter range needs to be explored and it is worthwhile to search for possible new tests. In
particular in the mass range m ∼ meV, the limits are signiﬁcantly weaker than in neigh-
boring mass ranges. Naively, low energy experiments probing this region should have a
spatial size ∼ 1/m ∼ mm. Experiments probing the quantum mechanical interference of
particles can be realized at this spatial size. Famous examples are experiments testing the
Aharanov-Bohm eﬀect (ABE). Experiments of the ABE type have already been discussed
as a possibility to search for a non-vanishing photon mass [13]. In this paper we investigate
the potential sensitivity of such experiments for hidden photons and consider further related
experimental conﬁgurations that could improve the sensitivity.

The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we brieﬂy recall the essentials of hidden
photons kinetically mixed with ordinary photons. In Sect. 3 we show how the ABE can be
used to probe the existence of hidden photons and we give an estimate of the sensitivity
of such experiments.
In Sect. 4 we suggest improvements in the simple ABE setup. We
conclude in Sect. 5.

are the ﬁeld strength tensors of the photon ﬁeld and hidden photon ﬁelds. The photon
coupling to electromagnetic charges is implemented by minimal coupling to the electric
four current jµ. We have included a mass term for the hidden photon, m, arising from a
standard Higgs mechanism or a Stueckelberg mechanism. The quantity  accounts for the
strength of the coupling between visible and hidden sectors and arises, e.g., at loop level
via heavy messenger exchange.
It is constrained to be very small, typically in the range
10−12 (cid:46)  (cid:46) 10−3 [8, 14–26], with quite some dependence.

The kinetic mixing can be removed from the Lagrangian by rotating the ﬁelds to a new

The observable essence of the ABE is the path-dependent phase Φ of an electron wavefunc-
tion, which is shifted in the presence of an electromagnetic potential

≡ exp(i∆ϕ).

(7)

Where the phase shift ∆ϕ is related to the magnetic ﬂux enclosed by the path of the electron,
∆ϕ = eΦ. Conclusive experimental evidence for the ABE was obtained in 1986 with the

c

experiment performed by Osakabe et al [27]. They employed a toroidal magnet, surrounded
by a superconducting shielding to avoid magnetic leaking. An interference pattern was
observed.

The theoretical modiﬁcation of the ABE in presence of a non-zero photon mass was
discussed in [13]. Now let us highlight the analogous eﬀect in the presence of hidden photons.
Consider eqs. (5)-(6) in the static limit,

(cid:0)∇2 − m2(cid:1) (cid:126)A(cid:48) = (cid:126)j,

∇2 (cid:126)A = −(cid:126)j,

(8)

(9)

where we have used the gauge condition A0 = ˜A(cid:48)
0 = 0, which is consistent when j0 = 0. The
equation of motion for the ﬁeld (cid:126)A is the usual equation for a massless gauge ﬁeld, and the
equation for the heavy HP is the Proca equation.

In order to get an estimate of the potential sensitivity of an ABE applied to HP search,
we consider the following idealized situation: a cylindrical solenoid, of radius rsol, whose
magnetic ﬁeld (in the ordinary photon case) is entirely conﬁned to the inside of the cylinder.
Using cylindrical coordinates and following [13], we ﬁnd that the magnetic ﬁeld associated
to (cid:126)A(cid:48) given by (cid:126)B(cid:48) = ∇ × (cid:126)A(cid:48) is

(cid:126)B(cid:48) = −ˆz j Θ(rsol − r) − ˆzm2 Π(r),

(10)

where Θ is the Heaviside step function, j is the current per unit height of the solenoid, of
radius rsol, and the function Π(r) is given by

Π(r) = −j

− Θ(r − rsol)K0(mr)

Now we can return to the original basis and then ﬁnd the conventional magnetic ﬁeld
(the one directly coupling to electric currents, cf. eq. (1)), given by (cid:126)b = ∇ × (cid:126)a. From eq (3)
we have (cid:126)a = (cid:126)A −  (cid:126)A(cid:48) and taking the curl of this equation we get

(cid:126)b(r) = ˆz jΘ(rsol − r) + ˆz j2 Θ(rsol − r) + ˆz m22 Π(r).

(12)

Therefore, the eﬀect stops being purely topological in nature: there is an actual small leaking
of magnetic ﬁeld.

To observe the ABE, an electron wave is split into two beams which are sent to pass by
each side of the solenoid and then recombined after it. Besides the trivial dependence on
the path, the interference pattern will depend on the magnetic ﬂux enclosed in the cylinder.
Varying the magnetic ﬁeld while keeping the path of the electrons ﬁxed, the interference
pattern will shift according to

∆ϕ = eΦ,

can be obtained by integrating Eq. (12) over the surface enclosed by the path, and reads

where we have chosen a circular path of radius R around the solenoid.
The above formula is however not ﬁnal yet, since it is not properly normalized in the
limit m → 0. This is because the electric charge gets renormalized by the photon-HP
mixing [28, 29]. To properly renormalize and get a limit for the kinetic mixing one could
follow [28] (see [30] for details).

To get an estimate of the sensitivity of an ABE let us brieﬂy consider a solenoid of radius
rsol with internal magnetic ﬁeld of B = 1 T. Optimistically assuming that we can determine
the internal magnetic ﬁeld with a precision of ∆B = 10−8 T one quickly sees that we are
sensitive only to  > 10−4. Clearly the sensitivity of such experiment is very limited and
can only probe a region in parameter space that has already been ruled out. The reason
behind this poor sensitivity is that we are measuring a tiny signal on top of a huge standard
model eﬀect. In the following we aim to devise a null experiment where the standard model
expectation is zero.

4 Two improved setups and two solution methods

The major issue with the above setup is to overcome the limited sensitivity in the mea-
surement of the phase shift of the electron beam. This obstacle can be evaded by directly
measuring the leaking magnetic ﬁeld with an ultralow-noise magnetometer like a Super-
conducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) or using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) techniques. To maximise the sensitivity one should modulate the B-ﬁeld, and thus
the signal, with a low frequency.

Further, by shielding the solenoid with a layer of superconducting material we suppress
eﬀects of any imperfection of the solenoid, that could provide some B-ﬁeld leakage of the
solenoid. Even in this case we would still have a leakage through the shielding because of the
hidden photon eﬀect. Thus, the setup would actually be a null experiment. A related setup
to look for hidden photons [31] along these lines was proposed some time ago. The main idea
was to consider a superconducting shield near to a source of magnetic ﬁeld. The derivation
of the sensitivity of such an experiment was simpliﬁed to a one dimensional problem.

Here we explore the potential of two setups, in a now realistic fully two-dimensional
treatment. In the following we will treat these setups as if they were static. We assume that
the B-ﬁeld responds adiabatically to a suﬃciently low frequency modulation of the current

generating it. To implement the modulation we can ramp the current in the solenoid up and
down. The two setups are:

Out This setup considers a cylindric solenoid of radius rsol, surrounded by a superconducting
shielding of thickness δ, (placed at a distance rsc from the origin of coordinates) and a
sensitive magnetometer outside the shielding.

In This setup inverts the topology of ﬁrst setup. It considers a cylindric solenoid of radius
rsol containing a superconducting shielding of thickness δ and a sensitive magnetometer
inside the shielding.

Both conﬁgurations are sketched in ﬁgure 1. We choose to ﬁrst cool down the superconduct-
ing shield and only then to switch on the current. In scenario Out this is merely a convenient
choice but in scenario In this ensures that the magnetic ﬁeld at the detector would vanish
in the absence of HPs, and thus we have a true null experiment.

We have solved the coupled equations for both setups Out and In. However, since
the direct solution of the two dimensional problem involves numerous boundary conditions
and subtle numerical procedures at the limit of the machine precision, we opted for double
checking all results with a completely independent analytical approximation. In the following
subsections those two methods will be presented and compared.

6

4.1 Method 1: Imposing boundary conditions

Our ﬁrst method for solving Out and In is straightforward: we solve the equations of motion
in all spatial regions considering the corresponding electromagnetic currents, according to:
solenoid, vacuum and shielding. The solenoid is treated as inﬁnitely thin. In the supercon-
ductor, the current is given by the London current (cid:126)js = − M 2
2 aϕ(r) ˆϕ and hence proportional
to the vector potential in the ϕ-direction. Thus, the equations are second order and linear
in the ﬁelds in all four regions. The most general solution involves a combination of two
functions with corresponding integration constants. These are determined by demanding
that ﬁelds and derivatives are continuous.

L

Setup Out)

For this setup the superconducting shielding contains a cylindric solenoid of radius r = rsol,
surrounded with a current given by (cid:126)j = j δ(r − rsol) ˆϕ, where j is the current per unit height
in the solenoid and ϕ is the polar angle. The detector (magnetometer) is placed outside the
shielding. The four spatial regions are therefore:

• Region I: 0 ≤ r ≤ rsol (inside solenoid), (cid:126)j = j δ(r − rsol) ˆϕ.
• Region II: rsol ≤ r ≤ rsc (gap between the solenoid and the SC shielding).
• Region III: rsc ≤ r ≤ rsc + δ (inside the superconductor), (cid:126)js = − M 2
• Region IV: rsc + δ ≤ r (detector in vacuum), (cid:126)j = 0.

We normalize all scales by the distance from the center of the solenoid to the position of the

do not contribute to the magnetic ﬁelds, but appear in the vector potentials as AIV(r) = n1/r

ﬁnd s1 = s2 = u1 = u2 = 0, h1 = h2 and t1 = t2. The other constants have to be determined
numerically.

In ﬁg. 2 we show the magnetic ﬁeld as a function of the distance. The photon-like state
(solid blue curve) and the sterile state (red solid curve) are produced by the solenoid, in the
region r ≤ rsol. Because of the external electromagnetic current there is a discontinuity in
the visible magnetic ﬁeld at r = rsol. In the adjacent vacuum region (rsol ≤ r ≤ rsc) the
hidden photon state it is mainly given by −A, since the sterile state is almost zero. Inside
the superconductor (shaded region) the photon-like state is exponentially damped (Meissner
eﬀect). Meanwhile the sterile state propagates almost unperturbed (small suppression due
to non-zero m). The photon-like state recovers at the end of the shielding due to the fact
that the sterile state is not a propagation eigenstate.

Setup In)

In this setup, the detector is placed inside a superconducting shield, which in turn sits inside
the cylindrical solenoid. Again, we distinguish four regions:

• Region I: 0 ≤ r ≤ rsc (detector in vacuum), (cid:126)j = 0.
• Region II: rsc ≤ r ≤ rsc + δ (cylindrical superconducting shielding), (cid:126)j = js ˆϕ.
• Region III: rsc + δ ≤ r ≤ rsol (vacuum between the superconductor and the solenoid),
(cid:126)j = j δ(r − rsol) ˆϕ.
• Region IV: rsol < r (vacuum outside), (cid:126)j = 0.

Here, (cid:126)js corresponds to the superconducting current, generated to expel the magnetic ﬂux
inside the shielding. The region IV carries no relevant information. We will consider the
“zero ﬁeld cooling” case, where the superconducting sample is ﬁrst cooled to its critical
temperature at zero external magnetic ﬁeld. In this case, the superconducting current can
be written by the London current. Thus, (cid:126)js = − (M 2
L ∝ to the penetration
length of magnetic ﬁeld in the superconducting sample, the so-called London mass.
Deﬁning new dimensionless variables, parametrized by the cylinder radius, ri → ri/rsol,
mi → mirsol, Ai → Airsol, and solving for each region, we ﬁnd the magnitude of the magnetic
ﬁelds (normalized by the magnetic ﬁeld of the solenoid) for the propagation states as

ﬁelds are normalized by the magnetic ﬁeld of the solenoid. We have chosen the parameters rsc = 1/3 rsol, δ =

There are in total ten integration constants ci, di, ei, fi, g1 (i = 1, 2), and one more that
does not contribute to the magnetic ﬁeld, but appears in the vector potential AIII(r) and
goes as g2/r (this last one is of course the key for the original ABE). The function Π(r) is
the same as in eq. (11). Imposing continuity to the vector potentials (A and A(cid:48)) and their
derivatives in each boundary of region I, II and III, we ﬁnd g1 = f2 = 0. It is hard to ﬁnd
analytical expressions for the rest of the integration constants, so we again have computed
them numerically. In ﬁg. 4 we show the magnetic ﬁelds normalized by the magnetic ﬁeld of
the solenoid as a function of the dimensionless distance r/rsol. The solenoid mainly produces
the photon-like state B − B(cid:48) (solid blue line) and a small sterile component bS = B(cid:48) + B
(solid red line). Since the photon-like state couples directly to the electric current, it gets
exponentially damped inside the superconductor because of the Meissner eﬀect. On the
other hand the sterile component can penetrate unperturbed through the solenoid. Because
of this component, the photon-like state reappears inside the superconducting shielding. The

blue dashed and red dotted lines correspond to the B(r) and B(cid:48)(r) ﬁelds, respectively. For
better representation we have chosen rsc = rsol/3, δ = rsol/3, mrsol = 1, MLrsol = 100 and
 = 0.01.

A notable feature of ﬁg. 4 (see also ﬁg. 5 below) is the change of sign in the magnetic
ﬁeld b inside the shielding that is visible as a sharp dip in the logarithmic plot. We can
understand this from the requirement that the total magnetic ﬂux in that region is zero,
inherited from the periodicity of the wave-function of Cooper pairs inside the superconductor

In a realistic setup, the London mass (ML) is typically of the order of the eV, thus

much bigger than the mass of the hidden photon we are interested in probing.
useful then to take the limit ML → ∞ in the equations of the magnetic ﬁelds inside the
superconductor. Looking at eqs. (19) we can see that K0(MLr) → 0 in this limit. In ﬁg. 5
we plotted the visible magnetic ﬁeld b(r) = B − B(cid:48) for three diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the
shielding in the realistic scenario that MLδ (cid:29) 1. For plotting we have ﬁxed the thickness of
the superconductor to δ = 0.05 rsol, MLrsol = 500 and m rsol = 10, but we vary the position
of the superconductor with respect to the solenoid. For a given radius of the solenoid, the
strength of the magnetic ﬁeld in the region of the detector can be optimized by choosing the
appropriate position of the superconducting shielding (black dashed line). To do so we have
used the analytical approximation we describe in the next subsection (see eq. (36)).

One can achieve a substantial simpliﬁcation of the problem by assuming that the London
penetration length is much smaller than the other length scales involved in the problem.
This is a realistic approximation as long as the hidden photon mass is not too large,

m (cid:28) ML | log 2|.

(23)

The log arises because for a null experiment we want to suﬃciently suppress the standard
leaking of the B-ﬁeld, ∼ B exp(−MLδ), such that it is smaller than the regenerated ﬁeld
from the hidden photon ∼ 2 exp(−mδ).

Under this assumption the electrical current in the superconductor can be taken as a mere
surface current js. Thus, the description of the whole system will be given by a solenoid with
radius rsol with current per unit height j, and a superconductor with radius rsc with current
−js. In a magnetostatic setting one can solve the equations in the propagation eigenstate

Of course the problem is not completely solved yet since the superconducting current js is
not a free parameter of the experiment, it has to be determined in terms of the initial current
j, the model parameters , m, and the geometric conﬁguration of rsol, and rsc. This can be

achieved by using the physical condition that the superconductor will readjust its surface
current to maintain zero inner magnetic ﬂux

Solving the condition (31) for the scenario Out gives to leading order

Those currents have to be replaced in the ﬁnal expression for b(r). After some simpliﬁcations
and approximations to leading order in , the magnetic ﬁelds on the detector side of the
superconducting surface turn out to be rather simple. In scenario Out one ﬁnds
mj {rsolI1(mrsc) − rscI1(mrsol))} K0(mr) + O(4),

which implies that no charge renormalization is necessary.

In order to check the robustness of those analytical results, one compares the approxima-
tion from this subsection to the full numerical solution obtained in the previous subsection.
In ﬁgs. 6 and 7 a comparison of the numerical solution and the analytical approximation
is shown for both scenarios Out and In. In the region of interest (location of the detector)
one can see that both methods are in very good agreement.

for a superconducting shielding with ﬁnite thickness and ﬁnite London mass (MLrdet = 500). The red line is
the analytical approximation which gives in the outside region (r/rdet ≥ 1) the magnetic ﬁeld strength (35).

4.3 Experimental reach

Given the very good agreement between the two methods of calculating the magnetic ﬁelds,
the experimental sensitivity analysis will be based on the simpler analytical approximation.
In the following we assume that the detector has a sensitivity to magnetic ﬁelds of order
bdet = 1· 10−18 T. These sensitivities are within reach of the most precise magnetometers for
integration times of order of one week, see for instance [32, 33]. Thus, deviations from the
classical null result, like the hidden photon induced btot, would be detectable if

btot ≥ bdet.

(38)

Inserting (35) or (36) into this inequality and solving for  one gets the expected experimental
sensitivity range as a function of j, bdet, m, rsol, rsc, and r. For the scenario Out one gets

For the analysis of the parameter range the radius of the solenoid was ﬁxed to rsol = 2 cm

detector r was ﬁxed for both experimental scenarios. For the scenario Out the position of the
detector was chosen to be r = 1.01 rsol (close to the superconducting shielding). While for the
scenario In the position of the detector was chosen to be at the center of the solenoid r = 0.
Those settings left rsc and m as free parameters of (39) or (40). Since other experiments
leave an interesting mass window at m ∼ 10−4 eV, cf. Fig. 8, it would be interesting to
choose an optimal position for the superconducting shielding rsc for this mass range. This is
achieved by setting m ∼ 10−4 eV and maximizing btot as a function of rsc. For the scenario
Out one ﬁnds good sensitivity for

turns out to be a good choice.
Now one can take those tuned experimental choices of the superconductor radii rsc|Out
and rsc|In and insert them in eqs.
(39) and (40), respectively, while allowing m to take
arbitrary values. This will ﬁnally give the experimental sensitivity range as a function
of the hidden photon mass  = (m).
In ﬁg. 8 the sensitivity range of (39) and (40) is
compared to the currently existing bounds [5,7], see also [34–40]. In the mass range of 10−4.5
eV< m < 10−1 eV one ﬁnds a sensitivity range which would be superior to existing limits.
Further, one can check to which extend this high sensitivity is sensible to the “optimal”
choice of rsc. It turns out this dependence is rather mild, for example when varying rsc in

(solid line) the superconducting shielding is placed at rsc = 2.4 cm and the detector at r = 1.01 rsol.

scenario In by 50% only varies the maximal sensibility by 50%, which would appear as small
eﬀect on the logarithmic scale of Fig. 8.

5 Conclusions

In this paper we studied the potential of using quantum interference experiments with cylin-
drical symmetry for exploring the parameter space of models with hidden photons (, m).
As starting point we estimate the reach for a classical Aharonov-Bohm type phase measure-
ment. It is found that in this case, the systematic and experimental uncertainties prevent
a competitive experimental reach. We suggest an improvement of the experimental setting
such that it becomes a null experiment in the spirit of [31]. For this improvement we study
two experimental scenarios diﬀering in the position of the detector, inside and outside the

tially relying on numerical methods and the other one using an analytical approximation.
For both scenarios a very good agreement between the two methods is achieved. Based
on the analytical approximation, we calculate the discovery potential of the two improved
scenarios in comparison to existing experimental and observational bounds. We see that a
signiﬁcant area of un-probed parameter space can be tested with experiments of this type.
