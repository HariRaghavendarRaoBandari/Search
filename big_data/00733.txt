TOTALLY DECOMPOSABLE SYMPLECTIC AND UNITARY

INVOLUTIONS

ANDREW DOLPHIN

Abstract. We study totally decomposable symplectic and unitary involutions
on central simple algebras of index 2 and on split central simple algebras
respectively. We show that for every ﬁeld extension, these involutions are either
anisotropic or hyperbolic after extending scalars, and that the converse holds
if the algebras are of 2-power degree. These results are new in characteristic
2, otherwise were shown in [3] and [6] respectively.

Keywords: Central simple algebras, involutions, characteristic two, hermitian
forms, quadratic forms.

1. Introduction

An algebra with involution is totally decomposable if it is isomorphic to a ten-
sor product of quaternion algebras with involution. Over ﬁelds of characteristic
diﬀerent from two, the adjoint involution of a Pﬁster form is a totally decompos-
able involution. Pﬁster forms are a central part of the algebraic theory of quadratic
forms, and in [2] it was asked whether totally decomposable involutions share certain
characterising properties of Pﬁster forms. In particular, whether totally decompos-
able involutions are exactly those involutions on algebras of two-power degree that
are either anisotropic or hyperbolic after extending scalars. That totally decom-
posable orthogonal involutions over a ﬁeld of characteristic diﬀerent from two are
always either anisotropic or hyperbolic can be shown (see [6, (3.2)]) using the non-
hyperbolic splitting results of Karpenko, [10], and that any totally decomposable
orthogonal involution on a split algebra is adjoint to a Pﬁster form. The later result
is known as the Pﬁster Factor Conjecture, and was shown in [3]. The converse, that
any orthogonal involution on an algebra of two-power degree that is anisotropic or
hyperbolic after extending scalars to any ﬁeld extension is necessarily totally de-
composable, is clear for split algebras, but otherwise remains largely open. In [7],
this question is considered for orthogonal involutions in characteristic two, whose
behaviour is somewhat unusual.

Here we consider analogues of the property that a totally decomposable orthog-
onal involution on a split algebra is either anisotropic or hyperbolic, and its con-
verse, for symplectic and unitary involutions. As every split symplectic involution
is hyperbolic, and hence the question is trivial in this case, we consider symplec-
tic involutions on an algebra Brauer equivalent to a quaternion algebra. We show

tor Conjecture in Characteristic Two, BE 2614/4) and the FWO Odysseus programme (project

that for every ﬁeld extension, totally decomposable symplectic involutions on index
two algebras and unitary involutions on split algebras are either anisotropic or hy-
perbolic after extending scalars, and that the converse holds if the algebras are of
two-power degree. These results were ﬁrst proven in [3] and [6, (3.1)] respectively
under the assumption that the base ﬁeld was of characteristic diﬀerent from two.
Here we make no assumption on the characteristic of the base ﬁeld.

Our approach follows that used in [3]. The main tool is an index reduction
argument using the the so-called trace forms of Jacobson, ﬁrst introduced for char-
acteristic diﬀerent from two in [13]. These trace forms give a correspondence be-
tween hermitian forms over a quaternion algebra or a quadratic separable extension
with the respective canonical involutions and certain quadratic forms over the base
ﬁeld. In sections §4 and §5 we consider versions of these results that hold in any
characteristic and derive analogous statements for involutions.

2. Algebras with involution

Throughout, let F be a ﬁeld, char(F ) denote its characteristic and F × denote its
multiplicative group. We refer to [14] as a general reference on ﬁnite-dimensional
algebras over ﬁelds, and for central simple algebras in particular, and to [12] for
involutions. Let A be an (associative) F -algebra. We denote the centre of A by
Z(A). For a ﬁeld extension K/F , the K-algebra A ⊗F K is denoted by AK . An
F -involution on A is an F -linear map σ : A → A such that σ(xy) = σ(y)σ(x) for
all x, y ∈ A and σ2 = idA.

Assume now that A is ﬁnite-dimensional and simple (i.e. it has no nontrivial
two sided ideals). Then Z(A) is a ﬁeld, and by Wedderburn’s Theorem (see [12,
(1.1)]) we have A ≃ EndD(V ) for an F -division algebra D and a right D-vector
space V , and furthermore dimZ(A)(A) is a square number, whose positive square
root is called the degree of A and is denoted deg(A). The degree of D is called
the index of A and is denoted ind(A). We call A split if ind(A) = 1. We call a
ﬁeld extension K/F a splitting ﬁeld of A if AK is split. If Z(A) = F , then we call
the F -algebra A central simple. Two central simple F -algebras A and B are called
Brauer equivalent if A and B are isomorphic to endomorphism algebras of two right
vector spaces over the same F -division algebra. If A is a central simple F -algebra
let TrdA : A−→F denote the reduced trace map and NrdA : A−→F the reduced
norm map (see [12, (1.6)] for the deﬁnitions).

An F -algebra with involution is a pair (A, σ) of a ﬁnite-dimensional F -algebra A
and an F -involution σ on A such that one has F = {x ∈ Z(A) | σ(x) = x}, and such
that either A is simple or A is a product of two simple F -algebras that are mapped
to one another by σ. In this situation there are two possibilities: either Z(A) = F ,
so that A is a central simple F -algebra, or Z(A)/F is a quadratic ´etale extension
with σ restricting to the nontrivial F -automorphism of Z(A). To distinguish these
two situations, we speak of algebras with involution of the ﬁrst and second kind : we
say that the F -algebra with involution (A, σ) is of the ﬁrst kind if Z(A) = F and
of the second kind otherwise. For more information on involutions of the second
kind, also called unitary involutions, we refer to [12, §2.B]. Involutions of the ﬁrst
kind are divided into two types, orthogonal and symplectic (see §3).

Let (A, σ) be an F -algebra with involution. If Z(A) is a ﬁeld, then A is a central
simple Z(A)-algebra, and we say (A, σ) is split if A is split as Z(A)-algebra. If
Z(A) ≃ F × F , then (A, σ) ≃ (B × B op, ǫ) where B is a central simple F -algebra,

TOTALLY DECOMPOSABLE SYMPLECTIC AND UNITARY INVOLUTIONS

3

B op is its opposite algebra and ǫ is the map exchanging the components of elements
of B × B op; in this case we say (A, σ) is split if B is split as an F -algebra. Given
a ﬁeld extension K/F , we abbreviate σK = σ ⊗ idK and (A, σ)K = (AK, σK ) is a
K-algebra with involution. We call K a splitting ﬁeld of (A, σ) if (A, σ)K is split.
Let (A, σ) and (B, τ ) be F -algebras with involution. Letting (σ ⊗ τ )(a ⊗ b) =
σ(a) ⊗ τ (b) for a ∈ A and b ∈ B determines an F -involution σ ⊗ τ on the F -algebra
A ⊗F B. We denote the pair (A ⊗F B, σ ⊗ τ ) by (A, σ) ⊗ (B, τ ). By an isomorphism
of F -algebras with involution we mean an F -algebra isomorphism Φ : A → B
satisfying Φ ◦ σ = τ ◦ Φ. Let (A, σ) be an F -algebra with involution with centre
K. We call (A, σ) totally decomposable if there exists an n ∈ N and F -quaternion
algebras with involution (Q1, σ1), . . . , (Qn, σn) with common centre K such that
(A, σ) ≃ Nn

i=1(Qi, σi).

We call (A, σ) isotropic if there exists an element a ∈ A\{0} such that σ(a)a = 0,
and anisotropic otherwise. We call an idempotent e of A hyperbolic with respect
to σ if σ(e) = 1 − e. We call an F -algebra with involution (A, σ) hyperbolic if A
contains a hyperbolic idempotent with respect to σ. By [12, (12.35)] we have:

Proposition 2.1. Let (A, σ1) and (A, σ2) be hyperbolic F -algebras with involution
such that σ1|Z(A) = σ2|Z(A). Then (A, σ1) ≃ (A, σ2).

Let (A, σ) be an F -algebra with involution. For λ ∈ Z(A) such that λσ(λ) = 1,
let Symλ(A, σ) = {a ∈ A | λσ(a) = a} and Symdλ(A, σ) = {a + λσ(a) | a ∈ A}.
These are F -linear subspaces of A and we write Sym(A, σ) = Sym1(A, σ) and
Symd(A, σ) = Symd1(A, σ).

We also need to consider quadratic pairs for our main results. Let (A, σ) be
an F -algebra with involution of the ﬁrst kind. We call an F -linear map f :
Sym(A, σ) → F a semi-trace on (A, σ) if it satisﬁes f (x + σ(x)) = TrdA(x) for
all x ∈ A.
If char(F ) = 2, then the existence of a semi-trace on (A, σ) implies
that TrdA(Sym(A, σ)) = {0} and hence by [12, (2.6)] that (A, σ) is symplectic. An
F -algebra with quadratic pair is a triple (A, σ, f ) where (A, σ) is an F -algebra with
involution of the ﬁrst kind, assumed to be orthogonal if char(F ) 6= 2 and symplectic
if char(F ) = 2, and where f is a semi-trace on (A, σ). If char(F ) 6= 2, then the
semi-trace f is uniquely determined by (A, σ) (see [12, p.56]). Hence in character-
istic diﬀerent from 2 the concept of an algebra with quadratic pair is equivalent to
the concept of an algebra with orthogonal involution. An isomorphism of quadratic
pairs (A, σ, f ) and (B, τ, g) is an isomorphism Φ of the underlying F -algebras with
involution satisfying f = g ◦ Φ.

Let (A, σ) and (B, τ ) be F -algebras with involution of the ﬁrst kind and let f
be a semi-trace on (A, σ). There is a unique semi-trace g on (B, τ ) ⊗ (A, σ) such
that g(b ⊗ a) = TrdB(b) · f (a) for all a ∈ Sym(A, σ) and b ∈ Sym(B, τ ) (see [12,
(5.18)] for the case of char(F ) = 2, otherwise this is trivial). Assume that (A, σ)
and (B, τ ) are orthogonal if char(F ) 6= 2. Then by [12, (2.23)], (B, τ ) ⊗ (A, σ) is
orthogonal if char(F ) 6= 2 and symplectic if char(F ) = 2. Hence we obtain an F -
algebra with quadratic pair (B ⊗F A, τ ⊗σ, g), which we denote by (B, τ )⊗(A, σ, f ).
By [5, (5.3)], the tensor product of algebras with involution and the tensor product
of an algebra with involution and an algebra with quadratic pair are mutually
associative operations. In particular, for an F -algebra with quadratic pair (A, σ, f )
and F -algebras with involution of the ﬁrst kind (B, τ ) and (C, γ), we may write
(C, γ) ⊗ (B, τ ) ⊗ (A, σ, f ) without any ambiguity.

Assume now that (A, σ) and (B, τ ) are symplectic. We may deﬁne a semi-trace
h on (B, τ ) ⊗ (A, σ) in the following manner. If char(F ) = 2, then by [12, (5.20)]
there exists a unique semi-trace h on (B, τ ) ⊗ (A, σ) such that h(s1 ⊗ s2) = 0 for
all s1 ∈ Sym(A, σ) and s2 ∈ Sym(B, τ ). If char(F ) 6= 2, then (B, τ ) ⊗ (A, σ) is
orthogonal by [12, (2.23)] and we let h = 1
2 TrdA⊗F B. In either case, we denote
the F -algebra with quadratic pair (B ⊗F A, τ ⊗ σ, h) by (B, τ ) ⊠ (A, σ). Note that
by [5, (5.4)], (B, τ ) ⊠ (A, σ) ≃ (B, τ ) ⊗ (A, σ, f ) for any choice of semi-trace f on
(A, σ). Moreover, for any algebra with involution of the ﬁrst kind (C, γ) we have

(cid:0)(C, γ) ⊗ (B, τ )(cid:1) ⊠ (A, σ) ≃ (C, γ) ⊗ (B, τ ) ⊗ (A, σ, f ) ≃ (C, γ) ⊗ (cid:0)(B, τ ) ⊠ (A, σ)(cid:1) .

We therefore use the notation (C, γ) ⊗ (B, τ ) ⊠ (A, σ) for this tensor product.

3. Hermitian and quadratic forms

We recall certain results we use from hermitian and quadratic form theory. We
refer to [11, Chapter 1] and [9, Chapters 1 and 2] for standard notation and termi-
nology, and as general references on hermitian and quadratic forms respectively.

Throughout this section, let (D, θ) be an F -division algebra with involution. Fix
λ ∈ Z(D) such that λθ(λ) = 1. Note that if (D, θ) is of the ﬁrst kind one must have
that λ = ±1. A λ-hermitian form over (D, θ) is a pair (V, h) where V is a ﬁnite-
dimensional right D-vector space and h is a bi-additive map h : V × V → D such
that h(xd1, yd2) = θ(d1)h(x, y)d2 and h(y, x) = λθ(h(x, y)) hold for all x, y ∈ V
and d1, d2 ∈ D. If λ = 1 then we call a λ-hermitian form simply an hermitian form.
If h(x, y) = 0 for all y ∈ V implies x = 0, then we say that (V, h) is nondegenerate.
We say (V, h) represents an element a ∈ D if h(x, x) = a for some x ∈ V \ {0}. We
call (V, h) isotropic if it represents 0, and anisotropic otherwise.

We say that a λ-hermitian form (V, h) over (D, θ) is even if h(x, x) ∈ Symdλ(D, θ)
for all x ∈ V . Note that if char(F ) 6= 2 or (D, θ) is unitary then all λ-hermitian
forms over (D, θ) are even as in these cases Symdλ(D, θ) = Symλ(D, θ) (see [12,
(2.A) and (2.17)]). Assume (V, h) is even. We say that (V, h) is hyperbolic if there
exists a totally isotropic subspace W ⊆ V with dimD(W ) = 1
2 dim(V, h). The
following proposition follows easily from [11, Chapter 1, (3.7.3)].

Proposition 3.1. Let ϕ and ψ be hyperbolic even λ-hermitian forms over (D, θ).
If dim(ϕ) = dim(ψ) then ϕ ≃ ψ.

Proposition 3.2. Let ϕ and ψ be even λ-hermitian forms over (D, θ) of the same
dimension. Then ϕ ≃ ψ if and only if ϕ ⊥ (−ψ) is hyperbolic.

Proof. That ϕ ⊥ (−ψ) is hyperbolic if ϕ ≃ ψ is clear. For the converse, we have
that ϕ ⊥ (−ψ) and ψ ⊥ (−ψ) are hyperbolic and of the same dimension. Therefore
by Proposition 3.1 we have ϕ ⊥ (−ψ) ≃ ψ ⊥ (−ψ). As −ψ is even we have ϕ ≃ ψ
by [11, Chapter 1, (6.4.5)].
(cid:3)

For every nondegenerate λ-hermitian form ϕ = (V, h) over (D, θ), there is a
unique F -involution on EndD(V ), denoted adh, with adh(a) = θ(a) for all a ∈ E
such that h(f (x), y) = h(x, adh(f )(y)) for all x, y ∈ V and f ∈ EndD(V ) (see [12,
(4.1)]). We denote the F -algebra with involution (EndD(V ), adh) by Ad(ϕ) and
we refer to it as the F -algebra with involution adjoint to ϕ. We denote the 1-
dimensional hermitian form (D, h) over (D, θ) given by h(x, y) = θ(x)y for x, y ∈ D
by h1i(D,θ). It is easy to see that Ad(h1i(D,θ)) ≃ (D, θ).

By a bilinear form over F we mean a λ-hermitian form over (F, id) (in this
case we must have λ = ±1). Let ϕ = (V, b) be a bilinear form over F . We call
ϕ symmetric if b(x, y) = b(y, x) for all x, y ∈ V , i.e. ϕ is a hermitian form over
(F, id). We call ϕ alternating if b(x, x) = 0 for all x ∈ V . This is equivalent to
ϕ being an even (−1)-hermitian form over (F, id), as Symd−1(F, id) = {0}. Any
split F -algebra with involution of the ﬁrst kind is isomorphic to Ad(ϕ) for some
nondegenerate symmetric or alternating bilinear form ϕ over F (see [12, (2.1)]). An
F -algebra with involution of the ﬁrst kind is said to be symplectic if it is adjoint to
an alternating bilinear form over some splitting ﬁeld, and orthogonal otherwise.

Let ϕ = (V, b) be a symmetric bilinear form over F and ψ = (W, h) be a λ-
hermitian form over (D, θ). Then V ⊗F W is a ﬁnite dimensional right D-vector
space. Further, there is a unique F -bilinear map b ⊗ h : (V ⊗F W ) × (V ⊗F W ) →
F such that (b ⊗ h) ((v1 ⊗ w1), (v2 ⊗ w2)) = b(v1, v2) · h(w1, w2) for all w1, w2 ∈
W, v1, v2 ∈ V . We call the λ-hermitian form (V ⊗F W, b ⊗ h) over (D, θ) the tensor
product of ϕ and ψ, and denote it by ϕ ⊗ ψ (cf. [11, Chapter 1, §8]).

For b1, . . . , bn ∈ F × the symmetric F -bilinear map b : F n × F n → F given by
(x, y) 7→ Pn
i=1 bixiyi yields a symmetric bilinear form (F n, b), which we denote by
hb1, . . . , bni. For a nonnegative integer m, by an m-fold bilinear Pﬁster form we
mean a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form that is isometric to h1, a1i ⊗ . . . ⊗
h1, ami for some a1, . . . , am ∈ F ×, and we denote this form by hha1, . . . , amii. We
call h1i the the 0-fold bilinear Pﬁster form.

By a quadratic form over F we mean a pair (V, q) of a ﬁnite-dimensional F -vector
space V and a map q : V → F such that, ﬁrstly, q(λx) = λ2q(x) holds for all x ∈ V
and λ ∈ F , and secondly, the map bq : V × V → F , (x, y) 7−→ q(x + y) − q(x) − q(y)
is F -bilinear. We say that (V, q) is nonsingular if bq is nondegenerate. Quadratic
forms correspond on a one-to-one basis to symmetric bilinear forms if char(F ) 6= 2,
but not otherwise. We say two quadratic forms ρ1 and ρ2 over F are similar if
there exists an element c ∈ F × such that cρ1 ≃ ρ2.

Recall that there is a natural notion of the tensor product of a symmetric bilinear
form ϕ and a quadratic form ρ over F , denoted ϕ ⊗ ρ (see [9, p.51]). For a nonneg-
ative integer m, by an m-fold quadratic Pﬁster form over F (or simply an m-fold
Pﬁster form) we mean a quadratic form that is isometric to the tensor product
of a 2-dimensional nonsingular quadratic form representing 1 and an (m − 1)-fold
bilinear Pﬁster form over F . For the following result see [9, (9.10) and (23.4)].

Proposition 3.3. Let m be a nonnegative integer. A nonsingular quadratic form ρ
with dim(ρ) = 2m is similar to a Pﬁster form if and only if for every ﬁeld extension
K/F , πK is either anisotropic or hyperbolic.

Quadratic pairs correspond to quadratic forms a way similar to the correspon-
dence between involutions of the ﬁrst kind and bilinear forms. To any nonsingular
quadratic form ρ = (V, q) over F one may associated a uniquely determined qua-
dratic pair on EndF (V ), giving the F -algebra with quadratic pair adjoint to ρ,
denoted Ad(ρ). See [12, (5.11)] for a description. By [12, (5.11)], any quadratic
pair on a split algebra EndF (V ) is the adjoint of some nonsingular quadratic form
over F . The notions of isotropy and hyperbolicity of quadratic forms extend to
quadratic pairs; see [12, (6.5) and (6.12)] for the deﬁnitions.

The following proposition summarises the various functorial results for hermitian

forms and involutions (resp. quadratic forms and quadratic pairs) we use.

Proposition 3.4. Let ψ and ψ′ be either nondegenerate even λ-hermitian forms
over (D, θ) or quadratic forms over F and let ϕ be a nondegenerate symmetric
bilinear form over F . Then
(1) Ad(ψ) ≃ Ad(ψ′) if and only if ψ ≃ cψ′ for some c ∈ F ×.
(2) Ad(ψ) is isotropic (resp. hyperbolic) if and only if ψ is isotropic (resp. hyper-

bolic).

(3) Ad(ϕ ⊗ ψ) ≃ Ad(ϕ) ⊗ Ad(ψ).

Proof. (1) See [12, (4.2) and (5.11)].

(2) See [12, (6.3), (6.6) and (6.13)] for the result for quadratic forms. For ψ a
λ-hermitian form, see [12, (6.7)] for the statement on hyperbolicity. See [4, (3.2)]
for the isotropy result for ψ a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form over F . The
proof is easily generalised to the case of a λ-hermitian form over (D, θ).

(3) For ψ a quadratic form, see [12, (5.19)]. Otherwise, let ϕ = (V, b) and
ψ = (W, h). For all f ∈ EndF (V ), g ∈ EndD(W ), v, v′ ∈ V and w, w′ ∈ W we have

(b ⊗ h)(f ⊗ g(v ⊗ w), (v′ ⊗ w′)) = b(f (v), v′) · h(g(w), w′)

= b(v, adb(f )(v′)) · h(w, adh(g)(w′))
= (b ⊗ h)((v ⊗ w), (adb(f )(v′) ⊗ adh(g)(w′))) .

Therefore by the bilinearity of b ⊗ h we have that adb⊗h(f ⊗ g) = adb(f ) ⊗ adh(g).
Using this, it follows from the linearity of adb⊗h that the natural isomorphism of
F -algebras Φ : EndF (V ) ⊗F EndD(W ) → EndD(V ⊗D W ) is an isomorphism of the
F -algebras with involution in the statement.
(cid:3)

It follows from Proposition 3.4(2) and [9, (1.8)] that any split algebra with sym-
plectic involution is hyperbolic and from Proposition 3.4(3) that an F -algebra with
involution adjoint to a bilinear Pﬁster form over F is totally decomposable.

4. Jacobson’s trace forms

We now consider hermitian forms over a quaternion division algebra or a sep-
arable quadratic extension together with their respective canonical involution. It
was ﬁrst shown in [13] that, over ﬁelds of characteristic diﬀerent from 2, the theory
of hermitian forms over these division algebras with involution can be reduced to
the study of quadratic forms over the base ﬁeld that are multiples of the respective
norm forms. A version of this result with no assumption on the characteristic of the
base ﬁeld was given in [15]. In this case we do not get a correspondence between
all hermitian forms and quadratic forms, but rather only between even hermitian
forms and quadratic forms. This is no restriction for ﬁelds of characteristic diﬀerent
from 2 or for the separable quadratic extension case, as then all hermitian forms
are even. For the cases of a separable quadratic extension and quaternion algebras
in characteristic diﬀerent from two, the main result of this section is shown in [16,
(10.1.1) and (10.1.7)]. Here we give a uniform presentation for both cases and with
no restriction on the characteristic of the base ﬁeld.

First we recall some facts on quaternion algebras. An F -quaternion algebra is
a central simple F -algebra of degree 2. Any F -quaternion algebra has a basis
(1, u, v, w) such that

u2 = u + a, v2 = b and w = uv = v − vu

TOTALLY DECOMPOSABLE SYMPLECTIC AND UNITARY INVOLUTIONS

7

for some a ∈ F with −4a 6= 1, b ∈ F × (see [1, Chapter IX, Thm. 26]). Let Q be an
F -quaternion algebra. By [12, (2.21)], the map Q → Q given by x 7→ TrdQ(x) − x
is the unique symplectic involution on Q; it is called the canonical involution of
Q. With an F -basis (1, u, v, w) of Q as above, the canonical involution γ on Q is
determined by the conditions

γ(u) = 1 − u

and

γ(v) = −v .

By considering Q as an F -vector space, we can view (Q, NrdQ) as a 4-dimensional
quadratic form on F . Further, (Q, NrdQ) is a 2-fold Pﬁster form and Q is split if
and only if (Q, NrdQ) is hyperbolic (see [9, (12.5)]).

Now let K/F be a quadratic ´etale extension. That is, K/F is either a separable
quadratic extension or K ≃ F × F . We call the non-trivial F -automorphism τ on
K the canonical involution of K. For every quadratic ´etale extension K/F there
exists an element u ∈ K satisfying

τ (u) = 1 − u

and

u2 − u = a

for some a ∈ F with 4a 6= −1 such that K is F -isomorphic to F (u) (see [1,
Chapter IX, Lemma 8] if K is a ﬁeld, otherwise take u = (0, 1)). Viewing K
as a 2-dimensional vector-space over F , we may consider the (K, NrdK) as a 2-
dimensional quadratic form over F . One can then directly check that NrdF (u) is
given by (x, y) 7→ x2 + xy + ay2. In particular, (K, NrdK) is a 1-fold Pﬁster form.
Further K ≃ F × F if and only if (K, NrdK) is hyperbolic.

Throughout the rest of the section, let (D, θ) be either an F -quaternion di-
vision algebra or a separable quadratic extension of F together with the respec-
tive canonical involution. Let (V, h) be a nondegenerate even hermitian form over
(D, θ). As (V, h) is even we have that for all x ∈ V , h(x, x) ∈ Symd(D, θ). Since
Symd(D, θ) = F , we may deﬁne a map V → F by x 7→ h(x, x). We denote this
map by qh. The ﬁrst statement in the following result can be found in [15, Thm. 1],
but we provide a full proof for completeness.

Proposition 4.1. Let (V, h) be a nondegenerate even hermitian form over (D, θ).
Considering V as a vector space over F , the pair (V, qh) is a nonsingular quadratic
form over F . Further there exists a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form ϕ such
that (V, h) ≃ ϕ ⊗ h1i(D,θ) and (V, qh) ≃ ϕ ⊗ (D, NrdD).
Proof. We clearly have that qh : V → F is such that qh(λx) = λ2qh(x) for all λ ∈ F
and x ∈ V . Further, let b : V × V → F be given by

b(x, y) = qh(x + y) − qh(x) − qh(y) = h(x, y) + θ(h(x, y)),

for x, y ∈ V.

It is easily checked that (V, b) is a symmetric bilinear form over F . Hence (V, qh)
is a quadratic form over F .

By [11, Chapter I, (6.2.4)] there exists an orthogonal basis (v1, . . . , vn) of (V, h)
with h(vi, vi) ∈ Symd(D, θ) \ {0} = F × for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. Let h(vi, vi) = ai
for i = 1, . . . , n. Consider the F -vector space U = F v1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ F vn. Then ϕ =
(U, h|U ×U ) is a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form over F , and the natural
isomorphism of D-spaces U ⊗F D → V gives an isometry (V, h) ≃ ha1, . . . , ani ⊗
h1i(D,θ). Hence for x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ V we have

h(x, x) = a1θ(x)x + . . . + anθ(x)x .

As θ(x)x = NrdD(x) for all x ∈ D we therefore have that (V, qh) ≃ ϕ ⊗ (D, NrdD)
for ϕ = ha1, . . . , ani, and in particular (V, qh) is nonsingular.

Proposition 4.2. Let (V, h) be a nondegenerate even hermitian form over (D, θ).
Then (V, h) is isotropic (resp. hyperbolic) if and only if (V, qh) is isotropic (resp.
hyperbolic).

Proof. Clearly (V, qh) is isotropic if and only if (V, h) is isotropic. By Proposition 4.1
there exists a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form ϕ such that (V, h) ≃ ϕ ⊗
h1i(D,θ). Now suppose (V, h) is hyperbolic. Then n = dimD(V ) must be even and
by Proposition 3.1 we may assume that ϕ ≃ h1, −1, . . . , 1, −1i. Then as (V, qh) ≃
ϕ ⊗ (D, NrdD) by Proposition 4.1 we have that (V, qh) is hyperbolic.

Conversely, suppose (V, qh) is hyperbolic. Then there exists a vector x ∈ V \ {0}
such that h(x, x) = q(x) = 0. As (V, h) is nondegenerate and even, by [11, Chapter
1, (3.7.4)] there exists a vector y ∈ V \ {0} such that h(y, y) = 0 and h(x, y) = 1.
Let U be the subspace of V generated by x and y. Then (U, h|U ) is the hyperbolic
2-dimensional hermitian form over (D, θ) and hence there exists a hermitian form
(W, h′′) such that (V, h) ≃ (W, h′′) ⊥ (U, h|U ) by [11, Chapter 1, (3.7.1)]. It follows
that (V, qh) ≃ (W, qh′′ ) ⊥ (U, qh|U ). As (U, qh|U ) is hyperbolic by the ﬁrst part of
the proof, it follows by Witt cancellation, [9, (8.4)], that (W, qh′′ ) is hyperbolic, and
the result follows by induction on the dimension of V .
(cid:3)

Corollary 4.3. Let (V, h) and (W, h′) be nondegenerate even hermitian forms over
(D, θ). Then (V, h) ≃ (W, h′) if and only if (V, qh) ≃ (W, qh′ ).

Proof. By Proposition 3.2 we have (V, h) ≃ (W, h′) if and only if (V, h) ⊥ (−(W, h′))
is hyperbolic. Similarly, using [9, (8.4)] we see that (V, qh) ≃ (W, qh′ ) if and only if
(V, qh) ⊥ (−(W, qh′ )) is hyperbolic. The result follows from Proposition 4.2.

5. Trace forms for involutions

By [12, (4.2)] even hermitian forms over a division algebra with symplectic
(resp. unitary) involution correspond to algebras with symplectic (resp. unitary)
involutions. In this section we use this correspondence to translate the hermitian
form results from §4 to statements on symplectic and unitary involutions.

Throughout this section let (B, τ ) be either an F -quaternion algebra or a qua-
dratic ´etale extension of F with respective canonical involution and let (A, σ) be
an F -algebra with symplectic involution such that A is Brauer equivalent to Q or
a split F -algebra with unitary involution with Z(A) = Z(B) and σ|Z(A) = τ |Z(B)
respectively. Further, let π = (B, NrdB).

Proposition 5.1. There exists a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form ϕ over F
such that (A, σ) ≃ Ad(ϕ) ⊗ (B, τ ).

Proof. If B is a split F -quaternion algebra or B ≃ F × F then (A, σ) and (B, τ ) are
hyperbolic and the result follows from Proposition 2.1, taking ϕ to be any symmetric
bilinear form of the appropriate dimension. Otherwise by [12, (4.2)] there exists a
nondegenerate even hermitian form ψ over (B, τ ) such that Ad(ψ) ≃ (A, σ). By
Proposition 4.1 there exists a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form ϕ over F such
that ψ ≃ ϕ ⊗ h1i(B,τ ). The result then follows from Proposition 3.4(3).
(cid:3)

Proposition 5.2. Let ϕ be a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form over F . Then
Ad(ϕ)⊗(B, τ ) is isotropic (resp. hyperbolic) if and only if Ad(ϕ)⊗Ad(π) is isotropic
(resp. hyperbolic).

Proof. If B is a split F -quaternion algebra or B ≃ F × F , then Ad(ϕ) ⊗ (B, τ )
and π are hyperbolic. Hence as is ϕ ⊗ π and therefore also Ad(ϕ) ⊗ Ad(π) by
Proposition 3.4(2). Therefore we may assume that B is a division F -algebra. By
Proposition 3.4(3) we have Ad(ϕ ⊗ h1i(B,τ )) ≃ Ad(ϕ) ⊗ (B, τ ). Since ϕ ⊗ h1i(B,τ )
is isotropic (resp. hyperbolic) if and only if ϕ ⊗ π is isotropic (resp. hyperbolic)
by Proposition 4.2, by Proposition 3.4(2) we have that Ad(ϕ) ⊗ (B, τ ) is isotropic
(resp. hyperbolic) if and only if ϕ ⊗ π is isotropic (resp. hyperbolic). This is equiva-
lent to the isotropy (resp. hyperbolicity) of Ad(ϕ⊗π) by Proposition 3.4(2). Finally,
Ad(ϕ ⊗ π) ≃ Ad(ϕ) ⊗ Ad(π) by Proposition 3.4(3), giving the result.
(cid:3)

Proposition 5.3. Let ϕ1 and ϕ2 be nondegenerate symmetric bilinear forms over
F . Then Ad(ϕ1) ⊗ (B, τ ) ≃ Ad(ϕ2) ⊗ (B, τ ) if and only if Ad(ϕ1) ⊗ Ad(π) ≃
Ad(ϕ2) ⊗ Ad(π).

Proof. By Proposition 3.4(1) and (3) we have Ad(ϕ1) ⊗ Ad(π) ≃ Ad(ϕ2) ⊗ Ad(π) if
and only if ϕ1 ⊗ π ≃ cϕ2 ⊗ π for some c ∈ F ×. This is equivalent to ϕ1 ⊗ h1i(D,θ) ≃
cϕ2 ⊗ h1i(D,θ) by Corollary 4.3 which is further equivalent to Ad(ϕ1) ⊗ (B, τ ) ≃
Ad(ϕ2) ⊗ (B, τ ) by Proposition 3.4(1) and (3).
(cid:3)

In the case where (B, τ ) is an F -algebra with symplectic involution, we get the

following reformation of Propositions 5.2 and 5.3.

Corollary 5.4. Assume (B, τ ) is an F -algebra with symplectic involution Then
(A, σ) is isotropic (resp. hyperbolic) if and only if (A, σ) ⊠ (B, τ ) is isotropic (resp.
hyperbolic). Further, let (A′, σ′) be an F -algebra with symplectic involution such
that A′ is Brauer equivalent to B. Then (A, σ) ≃ (A′, σ′) if and only if (A, σ) ⊠
(B, τ ) ≃ (A′, σ′) ⊠ (B, τ ).

Proof. By [8, (2.9)] we have Ad(π) ≃ (B, τ ) ⊠ (B, τ ). As (A, σ) ≃ Ad(ϕ) ⊗ (B, τ )
for some nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form ϕ over F by Proposition 5.1, the
result follows immediately from Propositions 5.2 and 5.3.
(cid:3)

6. Totally Decomposable Involutions

We now give our results on totally decomposable symplectic and unitary invo-
lutions. We ﬁrst recall the notion of a function ﬁeld of a quadratic form. Let ρ
be a nonsingular quadratic form over F . If dim(ρ) > 3 or if ρ is anisotropic and
dim(ρ) = 2, then we call the function ﬁeld of the projective quadric over F given
by ρ the function ﬁeld of ρ and denote it by F (ρ). In the remaining cases we set
F (ρ) = F . This agrees with the deﬁnition in [9, §22].

Theorem 6.1. Let (Q, γ) be an F -quaternion algebra with canonical involution and
(A, σ) be an F -algebra with symplectic involution such that A is Brauer equivalent
to Q and deg(A) = 2n with n > 1. The following are equivalent:

(i) (A, σ) is totally decomposable.
(ii) (A, σ) ⊠ (Q, γ) is adjoint to a Pﬁster form.
(iii) (A, σ) ≃ Ad(ψ) ⊗ (Q, γ) for some bilinear Pﬁster form ψ over F .
(iv) For any ﬁeld extension K/F , (A, σ)K is either anisotropic or hyperbolic.

Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii): If char(F ) 6= 2 then (A, σ) ⊠ (Q, γ) is equivalent to a totally
decomposable orthogonal involution, and the result is a special case of [3, Thm. 1].
If char(F ) = 2 then the result is a special case of [5, (7.3)].

(ii) ⇒ (iii): Assume that (A, σ) ⊠ (Q, γ) ≃ Ad(ρ) for a Pﬁster form ρ over F . As
QF (π) is split, we have that (A, σ)F (π) is hyperbolic and hence ((A, σ) ⊠ (Q, γ))F (π)
is hyperbolic by Corollary 5.4. Hence ρF (π) is hyperbolic by Proposition 3.4(2)
and by [9, (23.6)] we have ρ ≃ ψ ⊗ π for some bilinear Pﬁster form ψ over F . As
Ad(π) ≃ (Q, γ)⊠(Q, γ) by [8, (2.9)] we have (A, σ)⊠(Q, γ) ≃ Ad(ψ)⊗(Q, γ)⊠(Q, γ)
by Proposition 3.4(3). Therefore (A, σ) ≃ Ad(ψ) ⊗ (Q, γ) by Corollary 5.4.

(iii) ⇒ (i): This follows easily from Proposition 3.4(3).
(ii) ⇒ (iv): Let K/F be a ﬁeld extension. As ((A, σ) ⊠ (Q, γ))K is adjoint to a
Pﬁster form, it is either anisotropic or hyperbolic by Propositions 3.3 and 3.4(2).
Hence (A, σ)K is either anisotropic or hyperbolic by Corollary 5.4.

(iv) ⇒ (ii): For a given ﬁeld extension K/F , (A, σ)K is anisotropic or hyperbolic
if and only if the same holds for ((A, σ) ⊠ (Q, γ))K by Corollary 5.4. Let ρ be a
quadratic form over F such that (A, σ) ⊠ (Q, γ) ≃ Ad(ρ). Then dim(ρ) = deg(A) =
2n and we have that ρK is either anisotropic or hyperbolic by Proposition 3.4(2).
As this holds for all ﬁeld extensions K/F , we have that ρ is similar to a Pﬁster
form by Proposition 3.3 and the result follows from Proposition 3.4(1).
(cid:3)

Theorem 6.2. Let (A, σ) be a split F -algebra with unitary involution with centre
K and deg(A) = 2n with n > 1 and let τ be the non-trivial F -automorphism on K.
The following are equivalent:

(i) (A, σ) is totally decomposable.
(ii) (A, σ) ≃ Ad(ψ) ⊗ (K, τ ) for some bilinear Pﬁster form ψ over F .
(iii) For any ﬁeld extension L/F , (A, σ)L is either anisotropic or hyperbolic.

Proof. If K is not a ﬁeld then (A, σ) and (K, τ ) are both hyperbolic and by Prop-
osition 2.1 we have (A, σ) ≃ Ad(ψ) ⊗ (K, τ ) for any symmetric bilinear form ψ with
dim(ψ) = deg(A). Hence the equivalencies all hold trivially. We therefore assume
that K is a ﬁeld and let π = (K, NrdK).

(i) ⇒ (ii): By [12, (2.22)] there exist F -quaternion algebras with involution of

the ﬁrst kind (Qi, σi) for i = 1, . . . , n such that

(A, σ) ≃ (Q1, σ1) ⊗ . . . ⊗ (Qn, σn) ⊗ (K, τ ) .

Again by [12, (2.22)], we may assume that (Qi, σi) is symplectic for i = 1, . . . , n,
and hence we may assume that (B, σ′) = (Q1, σ1) ⊗ . . . ⊗ (Qn, σn) is symplectic if
char(F ) = 2 by [12, (2.23)]. Since BK is split by the hypothesis, it follows from
[9, (98.5)] that B is Brauer equivalent to an F -quaternion algebra Q. It follows
by [3, Thm. 2] if (B, σ′) is orthogonal and by Theorem 6.1 if (B, σ′) is symplectic
that (B, σ′) ≃ Ad(ϕ) ⊗ (Q, δ) for some bilinear Pﬁster form ϕ over F , and some F -
quaternion algebra with involution (Q, δ). Hence (A, σ) ≃ Ad(ϕ) ⊗ (Q, δ) ⊗ (K, τ ).
We have that (Q, δ) ⊗ (K, τ ) ≃ Ad(ψ) ⊗ (K, τ ) for some 2-dimensional symmetric
bilinear form ψ over F by [4, (6.2)]. Hence by Proposition 3.4(3), (A, σ) ≃ Ad(ϕ ⊗
ψ) ⊗ (K, τ ) for the bilinear Pﬁster form ϕ ⊗ ψ over F .

(ii) ⇒ (i): This follows from Proposition 3.4(3).
(ii) ⇒ (iii): Let L/F be a ﬁeld extension. If Z(AL) is not a ﬁeld then (A, σ)L is
hyperbolic. Otherwise (A, σ)L is anisotropic or hyperbolic if and only if (ψ ⊗ π)L is
hyperbolic by Propositions 5.2 and 3.4(2). The result follows from Proposition 3.3.
(iii) ⇒ (ii): By Proposition 5.1 we have (A, σ) ≃ Ad(ϕ) ⊗ (K, τ ) for some sym-
metric bilinear form ϕ over F with dim(ϕ) = deg(A). Let ρ = ϕ ⊗ π. Let L/K be a
ﬁeld extension. If K ⊗F L = Z(AL) is not a ﬁeld then πL is hyperbolic. Otherwise
ρL is anisotropic or hyperbolic if and only if (A, σ)L is anisotropic or hyperbolic

by Proposition 5.2. In both cases, ρL is either anisotropic or hyperbolic. As this
holds for any ﬁeld extension L/F , ρ is similar to a Pﬁster form by Proposition 3.3.
Similarly, ρF (π) is isotropic, and hence hyperbolic. It then follows from [9, (23.6)
and (24.1)] that ρ ≃ cψ ⊗ π for some bilinear Pﬁster form ψ over F and some
c ∈ F ×. Hence by Proposition 3.4(1), Ad(ρ) ≃ Ad(ϕ) ⊗ Ad(π) ≃ Ad(ψ) ⊗ Ad(π).
It follows that Ad(ϕ)⊗ (K, τ ) ≃ Ad(ψ)⊗ (K, τ ) by Proposition 5.3, as required. (cid:3)
