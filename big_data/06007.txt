ABSTRACT
We present an in depth study on the evolution of galaxy properties in compact groups
over the past 3 Gyr. We are using the largest multi-wavelength sample to-date, com-
prised 1770 groups (containing 7417 galaxies), in the redshift range of 0.01<z<0.23. To
derive the physical properties of the galaxies we rely on ultraviolet (UV)-to-infrared
spectral energy distribution modeling, using CIGALE. Our results suggest that during
the 3 Gyr period covered by our sample, the star formation activity of galaxies in our
groups has been substantially reduced (3-10 times). Moreover, their star formation
histories as well as their UV-optical and mid-infrared colors are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from those of ﬁeld and cluster galaxies, indicating that compact group galaxies spend
more time transitioning through the green valley. The morphological transformation
from late-type spirals into early-type galaxies occurs in the mid-infrared transition
zone rather than in the UV-optical green valley. We ﬁnd evidence of shocks in the
emission line ratios and gas velocity dispersions of the late-type galaxies located below
the star forming main sequence. Our results suggest that in addition to gas stripping,
turbulence and shocks might play an important role in suppressing the star formation
in compact group galaxies.

INTRODUCTION

Over the past three decades, numerous studies indicated
that interactions between galaxies can aﬀect their evolu-
tion in terms of morphology, gas and dust content, as well
as star formation and nuclear activities. While it has been

shown that interactions can enhance star formation by fuel-
ing gas towards the central regions of galaxies and/or in-
crease their gas content via accretion and merging (e.g.
Struck 1999, and references therein), a number of stud-
ies indicated that the picture is more complex and other
physical phenomena, such as shocks and turbulence also
play a role (e.g. Appleton et al. 2006; Boselli et al. 2008;
Appleton et al. 2013; Alatalo et al. 2014). Since these pro-
cesses can inﬂuence the evolution of galaxies, the environ-

2

ment of galaxies is very relevant. Compact groups of galaxies
have been considered ideal targets to study environmental
eﬀects. Due to their high galaxy densities and low velocity
dispersions, their members have experienced numerous and
frequent interactions during their lifetimes (Hickson et al.
1992). Some studies have shown that a large fraction of clus-
ter galaxies might have been pre-processed in groups (e.g.
Cortese et al. 2006; Eckert et al. 2014), thus stressing even
more the importance of understanding the mechanisms driv-
ing the evolution of galaxies in diﬀerent kinds of groups.

The most studied compact group sample was the one
compiled by Hickson (1982), which consists of 100 local
(z<0.06) compact groups (hereafter HCGs), containing 451
galaxies. Further analysis using spectroscopic information
reduced this sample to 96 groups (Hickson et al. 1992). De-
tailed studies revealed that compact groups contain about
half of the late-type galaxy fraction that is observed in
the ﬁeld and almost double of what is seen in clusters
(Hickson 1982), and that they display ubiquitous signs
of tidal interactions (Mendes de Oliveira & Hickson 1994).
Verdes-Montenegro et al. (2001) reported gas deﬁciencies
in the individual galaxies, while Borthakur et al. (2010)
showed that the most evolved groups contain a diﬀuse com-
ponent of HI gas in their intra-group medium. They pro-
posed that as the groups evolve, neutral gas is ejected by
some mechanism into the group environment.

More recently, the advent of high-resolution infrared
telescopes (such as the Spitzer, Herschel, and the Wide-
ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer; WISE) made it possible to
study the dust obscured star formation activity, as well
as the cold dust properties of individual group galaxies.
Johnson et al. (2007) and Walker et al. (2012) examined a
sample of 12 HCGs and proposed that the observed deﬁcit
of galaxies in a given range of mid-IR colours could have
been due to their rapid evolution from the star forming
to the quiescent sequences. Warm H2 and [CII] imaging
revealed that the well known “Stephan’s Quintet” system
contains intergalactic material shock-heated by collisions
within the group (Appleton et al. 2006; Cluver et al. 2010;
Appleton et al. 2013). In a more comprehensive study of two
dozen HCGs, Cluver et al. (2013) found over 20 per cent of
the groups contained galaxies with enhanced shocked H2
emission, and these fell primarily in mid-infrared green val-
ley, a color space deﬁned by Spitzer IRAC colors. More re-
cent Herschel and CARMA observations from Alatalo et al.
(2015b) have shown that many of these same galaxies con-
tain molecular gas that is unable to form stars eﬃciently
– perhaps because of the existence of signiﬁcant turbulence
and shocks throughout the gas. Moreover, Lisenfeld et al.
(2014) showed that most of these warm H2 galaxies have
suﬀered a signiﬁcant decrease of the molecular gas content
and the associated star formation.

Using

data

multi-wavelength

(UV-to-IR),
Bitsakis et al. (2010, 2011) examined the dust obscured
star formation activity in HCGs. To interpret their results,
an evolutionary sequence was proposed, according to
the fraction of early-type galaxies each group contained.
Groups with more than 25 per cent early-type galaxies
were classiﬁed as “dynamically old”, while the remaining
groups (hosting mostly spiral and irregular galaxies) as
“dynamically young”. They showed that late-type galaxies
in dynamically old groups tend to exhibit redder UV-optical

colours, after correcting for dust attenuation. These galax-
ies also display more than an order of magnitude lower
speciﬁc star formation rates (SSFRs) and higher stellar
masses (Mstar), than the corresponding galaxies found
in dynamically young groups as well as galaxies in other
environments (such as the ﬁeld and early-stage interacting
pairs). Moreover, Bitsakis et al. (2014) examined the cold
dust emission in HCGs and showed that late-type galaxies
in dynamically old groups display high dust deﬁciencies
(almost an order of magnitude lower dust-to-stellar mass
ratios than dynamically young group and isolated ﬁeld
late-type galaxies).

Despite this progress, since HCGs are a local galaxy
sample, they cannot be used to unravel the evolutional his-
tory of galaxies in groups. For such an undertaking, a much
larger sample covering a wider range of redshifts is neces-
sary. In Bitsakis et al. (2015) we presented the largest multi-
wavelength compact group sample to-date. Having UV-to-
IR data for 7417 compact group galaxies, at 0.01<z<0.23,
this sample is suﬃcient to study the evolution of galaxy
properties over the past 3 Gyr. In that paper, we examined
the evolution of the nuclear activity and found that the frac-
tion of group-aﬃliated galaxies hosting an Active Galactic
Nucleus (AGN) increase signiﬁcantly with time, even though
their overall nuclear luminosities are reduced at that pe-
riod. We also identiﬁed a connection between the incidence
of AGN activity and the dynamical state of the group, with
galaxies in dynamically old groups being more likely to host
an AGN at a given stellar mass. In our current study we use
the same sample to explore the evolution of star formation
as well as the physical mechanisms that might aﬀect it. More
speciﬁcally, in §2 we describe the sample selection, data ac-
quisition and the method of calculating the properties of the
individual galaxies. In §3 we present our results, and in §4 we
discuss their implications in the context of galaxy evolution
and propose an new evolutionary scheme for groups. Finally,
in §5 we summarize the main conclusions of our study.

Throughout this work, a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmological model
is used, with parameters: H0=70 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm=0.30
and ΩΛ=0.70.

2 SAMPLE SELECTION

Our sample comprises 1770 compact groups, containing
7417 galaxies. The data acquisition and the spectral en-
ergy distribution (SED) ﬁtting, were described in detail
in Bitsakis et al. (2015). In the following paragraphs, we
present only a brief discussion of the selection process, the
morphological classiﬁcation, the SED ﬁtting as well as the
analysis and treatment of possible biases.

The sample originates from the so-called Catalogue-A of
McConnachie et al. (2009). These authors initially improved
the compact group selection criteria introduced by Hickson
(1982), and then applied them to the whole Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (Abazajian et al. 2009),
and compiled their Catalogue-A (containing 2217 compact
groups). In that manner, the catalogue is more complete that
the original compact group sample of Hickson (1982), as it
includes all galaxies that satisfy the selection criteria out to
a z∼0.25. To address the goals of our current study of exam-
ining the evolution of the nuclear and star formation activ-

ities in compact groups, a multi-wavelength coverage of the
sample is essential. We cross-correlated Catalogue-A with
the ultraviolet (UV) all sky survey of Galaxy Evolution Ex-
plorer (GALEX; Morrissey et al. 2005), as well as the near-
infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) surveys of 2MASS
(Skrutskie et al. 2006) and WISE (Wright et al. 2010) re-
spectively. Since the only selection criterion we applied was
the availability of UV-to-MIR observations for a group as
opposed to an individual galaxy, our sub-sample is also com-
plete as the original Catalogue-A. Due to SDSS ﬁber colli-
sion constraints, we recovered optical spectroscopy only for
4208 galaxies in our sample (57 per cent of the total sam-
ple). This constraint could introduce possible biases in our
sample, since the lack of optical spectroscopy will be pref-
erentially found in denser groups. However, since the origi-
nal compact group sample selection by McConnachie et al.
(2009), did not rely on spectroscopic data but instead used
simulations to ﬁne tune the brightness and compactness cri-
teria in order to establish group membership, this is not
an issue. As an additional precaution and after the ﬁnal
selection of the sample, you use spectroscopic information
to reject galaxies as group members if they were obvious
cases of interlopers (having line-of-sight velocity diﬀerences
>1200 km sec−1 from the brightest group member). Our
ﬁnal sample consists of 7417 galaxies, found in 1770 com-
pact groups (CGs), with N>3 members. As it was shown
in Duplancic et al. (2013) and Sohn et al. (2016), galaxy
triplets and compact groups with N>4 have similar proper-
ties, which are very diﬀerent from those observed in galaxy
pairs and clusters. Finally, for the purposes of this study,
galaxies with no available spectroscopy were assigned with
the redshift of their brightest neighbor.

To classify the morphologies of our galaxies, we use
the results of Simard et al. (2011). Based on their ﬁndings,
galaxies with ﬁtted radial parameters of bulge-to-disk ra-
tio (B/T) >0.35 and image smoothness parameter at half-
light radius (S2) >0.75, were classiﬁed as early-type galaxies
(hereafter ETGs; typically lenticular and elliptical galaxies),
whereas the remaining as late-type galaxies (hereafter LTGs;
refers to spiral and irregular galaxies). By applying this
classiﬁcation, we found 3045 LTGs (41 per cent) and 4367
ETGs (59 per cent) in our sample. To examine the validity
of this classiﬁcation, we compared them with independent
morphological classiﬁcations from the Galaxy Zoo project1
(Lintott et al. 2011) and found that there is a 96 per cent
agreement in the classiﬁcations of the 3955 galaxies in com-
mon. Using our derived morphologies, we also determined
the groups’ dynamical states, as described in Bitsakis et al.
(2010). Groups with more than 25 per cent of ETGs are clas-
siﬁed as dynamically old, and the rest as dynamically young.
We ﬁnd that 373 of our groups are dynamically young (21
per cent), and 1397 are dynamically old (79 per cent)

Using the state-of-the art SED code CIGALE (Noll et al.
2009), we ﬁtted the observed UV-to-IR SEDs of our galaxies,
and estimated some of their most important physical prop-
erties. The code is based on the total energy balance between
the energy absorbed in the UV-optical bands and that re-
emitted in the IR, and builds SED models which are then
compared to the data. The method uses a delayed star for-

mation history (SFH)2, which can provide good estimates3
of the stellar masses (Mstar) and star formation rates (SFR)
of the galaxies (for more details see Ciesla et al. 2015). This
star formation history is a user-provided parameter which
can be modiﬁed to explore various scenarios. CIGALE also
accounts for the presence of AGN, based on a library of the-
oretical models from Fritz et al. (2006), and can be used to
separate the amount of AGN emission from that due to star
formation.

To avoid Malmquist bias, when comparing galaxies at
diﬀerent redshifts, we select a mass range that contains
galaxies at all redshifts (10.4< log[Mstar (M⊙)]<11.3). This
covers the typical mass range where compact group galaxies
are usually found (estimated to be log(Mstar)∼10.66±0.74
M⊙ in Hickson compact groups; Bitsakis et al. 2011), and
it is used only in the cases of the comparison between
galaxies at diﬀerent redshifts. We also separate our sam-
ple into four diﬀerent redshift bins (Bin1: 0.01<z<0.078,
Bin2: 0.078<z<0.104, Bin3: 0.104<z<0.133, and Bin4:
0.133<z<0.23). The four bins were selected so that they
contain an equal number of galaxies (∼1100) after the mass
selection criterion was applied, although do not sample the
same co-moving volume (for more details see Table 1 of
Bitsakis et al. 2015).

3 RESULTS

3.1 The evolution of UV-optical colours

In Bitsakis et al. (2011), we studied the UV-optical colour
distribution of 135 galaxies, taken from the original Hick-
son nearby compact group sample (HCGs). Contrary to
what it is observed in the ﬁeld and in clusters, where
a strong bimodality appears between the [NUV-r] colours
of star-forming and quiescent galaxies (Wyder et al. 2007;
Haines et al. 2008), a large number of the HCG LTGs were
located in the intermediate area, the so-called “green val-
ley” (having 3<[NUV-r]<5). A detailed analysis, using SED
modeling, ruled out dust extinction as the major mechanism
reddening their colours. We also showed that the majority
of LTGs located in the green valley, were found in dynami-
cally old groups. We concluded that this behavior could be
attributed to past galaxy-galaxy interactions and possible
minor merging that may have reduced their star formation
activity, by removing gas, as well as, increasing their stellar
masses (thus the fraction of red stars).

In Fig. 1, we present the extinction corrected rest-
frame4 [NUV-r] colour distributions of 4355 galaxies in
our current sample, within the mass range 10.4< log[Mstar

2 The delayed SFH is deﬁned as: SFR(t) ∝ t exp(-t/τ1), where t
is the time and τ1 the e-folding time of the star forming activity.
A small value of τ ∼1 Gyr will model a typical early-type galaxy
whereas a higher value of 10 Gyr will provide a more constant
SFR with time, typically obtained for late-type galaxies.
3 The goodness of the ﬁt is given by the reduced-χ2. In our study
the median χ2 value is 2.37 (with those of the 25th and 75th
percentiles being 1.22 and 4.36, respectively).
4 The synthetic rest-frame colours are derived from the model-
SEDs, using the K-corrections described in Chilingarian et al.
(2012).

(M⊙)]<11.3 (as explained in §2). We separate them accord-
ing to their morphology and group dynamical state, as well
as the redshift range they are found. The results are given
in Table 1. In the same ﬁgure we also include the observed
rest-frame distributions (shown with dashed lines). The re-
sults suggest a signiﬁcant colour evolution towards redder
[NUV-r] colours, since z60.23. From Table 1, we notice that
the red-sequence LTGs have been increased by 10-20 per
cent and ETGs by ∼30 per cent, during the past 3 Gyr.

Moreover, dynamically old groups contain on average
more red galaxies (galaxies found in the green valley and red
sequence areas) than the dynamically young groups. This is
expected since –by deﬁnition– dynamically old groups con-
tain more ETGs. From Table 1 we can see that ETGs in
dynamically old groups are redder than those in dynam-
ically young groups, at all redshifts. What is surprising
is that LTGs in dynamically old groups also have redder
colours than those found in dynamically young groups. A

Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis reveals that the two LTG dis-
tributions are diﬀerent with PKS = 0.3 per cent5.

Based on the star formation histories of 210 HCG galax-
ies, Plauchu-Frayn et al. (2012) suggested that most com-
pact groups must have been formed approximately 3 Gyr ago
– also consistent with the hierarchical formation models (e.g
Fakhouri et al. 2010). Our results, reveal that even though
groups at z>0.104 do not have any red-sequence LTGs and
only a very small fraction (∼10 per cent) of red-sequence
ETGs, the evolution of those galaxies towards red colours is
rapid. Based on the colours of the diﬀerent redshift bins we
can see that it takes 1 Gyr for the ﬁrst galaxies to appear in
that region of colour-space, with the fastest evolution occur-
ring during the last 1-1.5 Gyr. Hickson et al. (1992) showed
that a typical timescale over which the gravitational inter-
actions can signiﬁcantly impact the member galaxies is ∼

ferent.

re-triggering from mergers and/or accumulation of stripped
gas. An additional explanation could arise from the UV-
upturn phenomenon (Code 1969; O’Connell 1999), which
is not treated properly by the stellar population synthe-
sis models. According to this, an enhancement of the UV-
band emission is observed in some elliptical galaxies, pro-
duced by a variety of evolved stars (e.g. old horizon-
tal branch stars) that typically dominate the emission at
λ <2000˚A (Boselli et al. 2005) of large elliptical galax-
ies (with log(Mstar) > 11.4 M⊙). This does not seem to
be the case here though, because, based on their stellar
masses (log(Mstar) < 11.3 M⊙; Fig 1) our ETGs are not
giant ellipticals. However, in order to completely rule out
emission from evolved stars, we also check the validity of
our model-derived SFRs (presented in dashed blue lines in
Fig. 2) by comparing them with those derived using diﬀer-
ent semi-empirical methods. The comparison is performed
with SFRs estimated from Hα line ﬂuxes, which are not
sensitive to UV-upturn, applying two diﬀerent methods. The
ﬁrst is described in Kennicutt (1998) after correcting Hα lu-
minosities from Dominguez S´anchez et al. (2012) (marked
as SFRH α−1 in the same ﬁgure). The second estimator
(marked as SFRH α−2) uses the updated Hα SFRs from
Kennicutt & Evans (2012), applying the extinction correc-
tions discussed in Garn & Best (2010). The small diﬀerences
among the three estimators (model-derived SFRs are higher
by ∼0.3dex, independent of the redshift bin), suggest that
the UV-upturn is not an important eﬀect in our sample, and
therefore the blue [NUV-r] colours are likely due to weak star
formation activity. In §3.3 we describe possible scenarios to
conserve and/or re-initiate the star formation in early-type
systems.

type galaxies in our sample, having 10.4< log[Mstar (M⊙)]<11.3.
With red solid and orange dotted lines we present SFRs estimated

and Kennicutt & Evans 2012, marked with indices 1 and 2 respec-
tively) and with blue dashed lines those from our SED model. The
vertical lines indicate the median values of each distribution, re-

200 Myr. This suggests that our galaxies, especially those
at lower-z’s had already enough time for the multiple inter-
actions and/or minor merging to shape their properties.

Examining the colours of the ETGs we ﬁnd that in
contrast to what is usually observed in clusters (where the
majority are found in the red sequence; see Haines et al.
2008), less than 30 per cent of our ETGs have such colours.
This can be either interpreted as residual star formation, or

a-d). The sub-panels indicate the four diﬀerent redshift bins used in this work, noted in the bottom right corners. At the bottom left
corners we mark the number of galaxies in each bin. Contours are in increments of 15 per cent. For comparison we also present the
late-type (panel e) and early-type (panel f) galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo (coloured contours; Schawinski et al. 2014), and a cluster
galaxy sample (black solid line contours; Lee et al. 2015). The dashed magenta lines bracket the infrared transition zone as described in
Alatalo et al. (2014). The R1-4 indicate the four regions described in §3.2. For the purposes of comparison between diﬀerent redshifts we
use galaxies within the mass range of 10.4< log[Mstar (M⊙)]<11.3 (A coloured version of this ﬁgure is available on the online journal)

3.2 The mid-infrared colours based on WISE

Johnson et al. (2007) examined the distribution of the
Spitzer mid-IR colours of HCG galaxies. They proposed that
the “gap” in the colours between star forming and quiescent
galaxies was only present in compact group samples, and
they attributed it to a rapid evolution of the galaxy colours.
Although not strictly a gap, as showed by Bitsakis et al.
(2011), the properties of the galaxies found in this area were
thoroughly studied by Walker et al. (2013), who showed that
galaxies in the mid-IR transition region (where that gap
was observed) were mainly located in the UV-optical red se-
quence. These galaxies have been considered a transitional
population, based on their star formation rates and molec-
ular gas properties (Lisenfeld et al. 2014).

A couple of other names have been used to describe this
colour “gap”, the “infrared green valley” (Cluver et al. 2013)
and the “infrared transition region” (IRTZ; Alatalo et al.
2014), when applied to WISE mid-IR colours. Examining
those mid-IR colours of the A2199 supercluster galaxies,
Lee et al. (2015) proposed an evolutionary scenario where
morphological transformation in galaxies occurs while they
are found within the mid-IR green valley.

Alatalo et al. (2014) presented the co-evolution of the
WISE mid-IR versus the SDSS [u-r] colours of several galaxy
samples (including star forming, post starburst, and AGN
hosting galaxies) and showed that those found in the IRTZ
were either classiﬁed as Seyferts or low-ionisation emission
line regions (LINER), whereas galaxies from the shocked

post-starburst galaxy survey (SPOGS; Alatalo et al. 2016)
are located near the star-forming edge, towards red optical
colours. They also proposed that galaxies in the IRTZ are
mostly late-stage green valley objects transitioning towards
red UV-optical colours, as they are shedding their remaining
interstellar gas.

Following the methodology of Alatalo et al. (2014), we
present in Fig. 3 the WISE [4.6]-[12.0]µm versus the extinc-
tion corrected SDSS [u-r] rest-frame colours of the galaxies
in our sample. As in Fig. 1, we separate galaxies according
to their optical morphologies, the dynamical state of their
group, and the redshift bin they are found. To compare our
observations with a large extragalactic sample that contains
galaxies found in various environments (mostly in the ﬁeld),
we present the colour distributions of the 47995 galaxies (65
per cent of which are LTGs) from the Galaxy Zoo sample
(Schawinski et al. 2014), found at 0.02<z<0.05 (presented
with coloured contours in panels e and f). We also com-
pare (using black contours) the 1529 late-type (panel e) and
early-type (panel f) cluster galaxies of z∼0.03 from Lee et al.
(2015), found in the same mass range as our sample. The
corresponding fractions of galaxies found in each of the three
regions of the mid-IR colour-space are also presented in Ta-
ble 2 (for simplicity we do not present the distributions of
the [u-r] colours, since they are very similar to those pre-
sented in Table 1). These regions include the active galaxy
region, which contains mostly luminous disk galaxies with
red colours (with [4.6]-[12.0]>2.4) , the IRTZ ( with 0.8 <
[4.6]-[12.0]< 2.4), and the passive galaxy region (with [4.6]-

[12.0]< 0.8). The latter mostly contains bulge dominates
quiescent galaxies.

As it was previously observed in the UV-optical, the
strong evolution of galaxy colours is also present in Fig. 3.
Typical LTGs in the ﬁeld are always located in the upper
left portion of the top panels (Region 1; marked with R1
in the same ﬁgure). One interpretation of the colour-colour
diagram is that as the star formation fades-out, galaxies

migrate towards the UV-optical green valley6, yet they still
display warm mid-IR colours (Region 2; R2). In the next
step, they shift towards the IRTZ (Region 3; R3), which is
mostly populated by ETGs (as one can see in the bottom
right panel of the same ﬁgure). Finally, ETGs move towards
the “red and dead” galaxy sequence in the bottom right

corner of the colour-space (Region 4; R4). Once again we
observe that LTGs in dynamically old groups are always
few steps ahead in this evolutionary scheme than LTGs in
dynamically young groups.

It is evident that compact group galaxies evolve dif-
ferently from both comparison samples. Unlike the diﬀer-
ences between compact groups and the ﬁeld, in the percent-
age of galaxies found in the blue cloud and red sequence,
both compact groups and clusters have a large fraction of
their galaxies in the green valley-IRTZ region (R3). Con-
trary to the galaxy populations of Galaxy Zoo, shown in
panels e and f of Fig. 3, the colours of LTGs in compact
groups – irrespective of their dynamical state – show an
“elbow” that is observed in the top right of all the sub-
ﬁgures (R2). One might hypothesize that this is due to en-
hanced warm dust emission from an AGN. However, CIGALE
is able to remove any dominant AGN component from the
WISE colors (more details of the process in Appendix A
and Ciesla et al. 2015). AGN-corrected colours are shown
as dotted contours in Fig. A1, where we can see that no sig-
niﬁcant changes occur in the colours of the LTGs. This re-
sult was expected since, as showed in Bitsakis et al. (2015),
there is a very small fraction (<1 per cent) of IR domi-
nant AGN in our sample. Therefore, the elbow in the colour
plane can be interpreted as residual star formation. Once
this fades-out, elbow galaxies will move towards the IRTZ.
Our results are thus in excellent agreement with the ﬁnd-
ings of Alatalo et al. (2015b), who observed a similar evo-
lution in the corresponding colours of a sample of 14 HCG
galaxies. According to their ﬁndings, galaxies located in the
elbow display star formation suppression (measured using
the Schmidt-Kennicutt diagram; Kennicutt 1998) by a fac-
tor of a few. That suppression is increases up to factors
of ten (80× for their most extreme object) as the galaxies
shift their colours towards the IRTZ. Alatalo et al. (2014)
showed that galaxies located in the elbow are mostly clas-
siﬁed as Seyferts and post-starburst, whereas those in the
IRTZ mostly exhibit LINER emission. An alternative ex-
planation for the creation of the elbow is also discussed by
these authors. According to this, it is likely that the [12µm]
band of WISE will contain a signiﬁcant contribution of the
11.3µm polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature. It
was shown that this emission can be signiﬁcantly altered by
relatively weak UV ﬁeld (i.e. LINER emission; Sturm et al.
2006). However, this band is very wide (covering the [7.1]-
[18.1]µm) and, it may also be aﬀected by the 9.7µm silicate
absorption feature. Thus, in the absence of mid-IR spectra
the interpretation on the variation of its strength is rather
speculative (Smith et al. 2007).

Examining the distributions of ETGs at higher-z’s we
can see that the majority is located within the IRTZ, and
during the next 2 Gyr their colours will likely evolve towards
the lower right corner of the colour-space. The majority of
IRTZ galaxies are early-type systems, both in groups and
clusters, but the IRTZ still contains a considerable fraction
of LTGs (∼10 per cent). It is, thus, possible that these LTGs
moved to IRTZ after crossing the star forming and the el-
bow regions. As a result the morphological transformation
of LTGs into ETGs seems to occur within the IRTZ. Our
results agree with the conclusions of Lee et al. (2015) and
Alatalo et al. (2015b), who suggested that LTGs in IRTZ
shed their gas content, which has as a result to cease their

star formation activity, and to eventually transform them
into ETGs.

Finally, in Fig. 4, we present the mid-IR colour distri-
butions of the low-z (z<0.078) galaxies of our sample and we
compare them with the corresponding distributions of the
Galaxy Zoo. As it was expected (see Bitsakis et al. 2011)
the distribution of the LTGs in compact groups is bimodal
with the majority located in the mid-IR active galaxy re-
gion and a smaller fraction in the IRTZ, just over the ETG
galaxy distribution. One can notice the lower concentration
of LTGs between the two regions, that is not observed in
the LTGs of the ﬁeld. This eﬀect was initially observed by
Walker et al. (2010), who interpreted it as an accelerated
evolution of LTGs from star-forming to quiescent.

3.3 Star formation activity

In Fig. 5, we present the distributions of the speciﬁc star for-
mation rates (SSFRs) of the galaxies in our sample. Galaxies
are separated as in Fig. 1. In Table 3, we also present the
median values of the SFRs and SSFRs of the sub-samples
that are shown in the corresponding panels of Fig. 5. Consis-
tent with the results of the previous sections, we can observe
a signiﬁcant decrease of the SSFRs throughout time, at all
galaxy subsamples. Moreover, galaxies in dynamically old
groups appear to have lower median SFRs and SSFRs from
those in dynamically young ones, the exception being LTGs
of Bin 3.

Elbaz et al. (2007) showed that the star formation-
environmental dependence we observe today, where galaxies
in dense environments tend to be redder and more quiescent,
reverses at z∼1, with the denser environments hosting most
of the star forming galaxies. In Fig. 6, we present the stellar
mass-SFR relation of the LTGs in our sample, found in the
mass range described earlier. The four panels correspond to
the regions described in §3.2. The magenta solid line indi-
cates the star forming main sequence derived for z60.1 SDSS
galaxies and the black dotted line for z60.3 galaxies from the
Millennium simulation (both described in Elbaz et al. 2007).
The dashed lines ﬁt the corresponding compact group data
in each panel. Galaxies in Region 1 follow the star forming
sequence, whereas those in Regions 2-4 are moving increas-
ingly away from it, despite the fact that they are still mor-
phologically classiﬁed as LTGs – which naturally follow the
main sequence. These results are in agreement with those
of Erfanianfar et al. (2015), where they show that, at low-
z’s, groups contain a large population of red disk-dominated
galaxies – not present in less dense environments – that are
located below the main sequence.

In Fig. 7, we present the distributions of the SFRs of all
the galaxies in our sample (both LTG and ETG), separating
them to the regions described in §3.2. We can see that galax-
ies in Region 1 display signiﬁcantly higher SFRs than galax-
ies in Region 2 (the elbow) – also according to Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test, with possibility of PKS <10−4. Despite that
galaxies in both Regions 1 and 2 have red WISE colors and
are classiﬁed as LTGs, the former display SFRs consistent
with those of typical LTGs, whereas the SFRs of the latter
are already suppressed. In addition, galaxies of Regions 3
and 4 have signiﬁcantly lower SFRs, with the distribution
of the galaxies in Region 3 covering partially both Regions
2 and 4. This result is very interesting given that Region 3

contains both LTGs and ETGs, and may be consistent with
the scenario of morphological transformation we described
in §3.2.

The high SFRs observed in ETGs are not due to ex-
cess UV due to the UV-upturn (see §3.1), but are rather
due to residual star formation activity or re-started star

formation due to gas accretion or mergers. Such increase
could occur by accretion and/or merging of their compan-
ions. In Bitsakis et al. (2014) we also found several dusty
green-valley ETGs that display similar MH 2-to-Mdust ratios
and SSFRs with green valley LTGs. It is worth noticing here
we detect them more often at higher z, which may be due

to the fact that at earlier epochs, the LTG companions from
which they could potentially accrete gas, have higher gas
fractions. However, such accretion may not always stimulate
star formation. Appleton et al. (2014) presented the case of
NGC3226, where the cold accretion from a tidal stream,
results in a net inhibition of star formation, by introduc-
ing turbulence into the interstellar medium (ISM) of this
galaxy. Another, possibility is that our ETGs may have some
residual star formation from remaining gas. It is not clear,
though, why these galaxies did not consume that gas earlier
to form stars. In the next paragraph we will describe mecha-
nisms that inhibit star formation by introducing shocks and
turbulence into the ISM of galaxies.

3.4 The possibility of shocks

Our results so far, as well as those from the analyses of sim-
ilar compact group samples (i.e. Alatalo et al. 2015b), sug-
gest that the suppression of star formation in LTGs occurs
before these galaxies morphologically transform into earlier
types. What possible mechanisms can produce such an ef-
fect? In addition to gas stripping, which is of a great impor-
tance in HCGs (see Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2001), several
compact group studies argued that shocks and turbulence
might be responsible (e.g Cluver et al. 2013; Lisenfeld et al.
2014). Although shocks are transient phenomena (usually
lasting 10-100 Myr; Guillard et al. 2009), galaxies in groups
are expected to experience multiple interactions that may
cause an almost constant input of tidal energy in their
ISM (Hickson et al. 1992, reports typical dynamical times
of 200 Myr). Alatalo et al. (2014) showed that Region 2
is mostly populated by Seyfert and post-starburst galaxies,
whereas Region 3 is dominated by galaxies showing LINER
or LINER-like emission that may be originated by shocks.

Figure 7. Distributions of the SFRs of all the galaxies in our sam-
ple within the stellar mass range 10.4< log[Mstar (M⊙)]<11.3.
The four panels correspond to the diﬀerent regions of the [u-r] vs
WISE colour-space, as presented in §3.2. (A coloured version of
this ﬁgure is available on the online journal)

However, detecting shocks is a diﬃcult task, especially
for a large sample. The kinetic energies of shocks are dissi-
pated through strong radiation ﬁelds (in the X-ray and UV
bands), resulting in the photoionisation of a large number of
species, which aﬀect the global emission line ratios of galax-
ies. Since no X-ray or UV spectroscopic data are available
for our sample, we can only rely on optical spectroscopy.
Simulations of Allen et al. (2008) showed that shocks can
aﬀect the Kewley et al. (2006) classiﬁcation diagrams, mak-
ing galaxies appear having a LINER-like classiﬁcation. On
the other hand, the emission of shock pre-cursors can imi-
tate that of Seyfert nuclei (Alatalo et al. 2016). In Fig. 8,
we present the optical emission line diagrams, described in
Kewley et al. (2006), of the diﬀerent regions of the [u-r]-
WISE colour-space, described in §3.2. Although, our spec-
troscopic data refer to the SDSS single-ﬁber coverage of the
central regions of our galaxies (see Fig. 7 in Bitsakis et al.
2015), the signiﬁcant evolution of the emission line ratios
from Regions 1 and 2 towards Regions 3 and 4 is evident.
Region 1 mostly contains normal star forming galaxies, in
agreement with the results of §3.3. On the other hand, al-
though Region 2 still contains a large fraction of star form-
ing galaxies (with much lower SFRs, as seen in §3.3), more
than 1/3 of its galaxies are found in the higher excitation
region (the threshold between Seyfert and LINER-like emis-
sion), suggesting the possibility of on-going shocks in some
of these sources, in addition to weak nuclear activity (as de-
scribed in Bitsakis et al. 2015). Finally, in addition to AGN,
shocks could also explain the behavior of the BPT diagrams
of galaxies in both Regions 3 and 4.

If shock excitation is important in our galaxies, then we
expect that the eﬀects of shocks will be also reﬂected in the
velocity dispersions of the forbidden higher-excitation lines
(i.e. [NII]λ6583, or [OI]λ6300). The reason is that shocks
will deposit kinetic energy on the gas increasing its turbu-
lence, broadening the emission lines – especially those of
higher excitation (see Rich et al. 2014, 2015). In Fig. 9 we
plot the emission line ratios versus the velocity dispersion

(σF orbidden) of these lines for the galaxies in our sample,
again separating them as in §3.2. We also present their me-
dian values in the second column of Table 4. Our results
suggest that only galaxies from Regions 3 and 4 (and a very
small minority from Region 2) display emission line ratios
as well as velocity dispersions that could be consistent with
shocks (i.e. σ >150 km sec−1). Nevertheless, the rotation of
these galaxies – especially those with higher inclinations –
could bias the gas velocity dispersions that we measure (en-
hancing them even by 30 percent; see Bellovary et al. 2014).
Using the results of the radial proﬁle ﬁtting of our galaxies
from Simard et al. (2011), we present in Fig. B1 and Table 4
the inclinations of our galaxies as a function of the velocity
dispersion of their gas. From the above it is evident that de-
spite galaxy inclination can be high in many cases, it could

not bias the results of Fig. 9, since it does not prefer any
particular region but its distribution is rather random.

In the last column of Table 4 we also present the median
values of the sodium D (NaD) equivalent widths (EW(NaD))
of the galaxies in these four regions. NaD (at 5889 and
5895˚A) is produced in stars – especially those of spectral
types F-G-K-M – and enrich the ISM via stellar winds,
where its depleted on dust grains. Large velocity shocks can
destroy those grains, and therefore increase the fraction of
gas-phase NaD in the ISM (Murray et al. 2007). NaD can
also probe outﬂows (see Rupke et al. 2005; Veilleux et al.
2005), and therefore is degenerate (Lehnert et al. 2011),
from Table 4 we can still see that EW(NaD)’s almost double
their value, from Region 1 to Region 4.

AGN feedback could also be an alternative mechanism

to explain the suppression of star formation, even if some-
times can also provide positive feedback (see Combes 2015;
Lanz et al. 2016). In Bitsakis et al. (2015) we showed how
the fraction of AGN hosting compact group galaxies in-
creases towards lower redshifts. We also showed that the vast
majority are classiﬁed as low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN),
displaying AGN Hα luminosities of ∼1-4×1040 erg sec−1, at
z>0.104 and decreasing to <0.6×1040 erg sec−1, at z<0.078.
Although, LLAGN can interact with the molecular content
of their hosts suppressing the global star formation (such
as the case of NGC1266 Alatalo et al. 2015), Alatalo et al.
(2015b) showed that in their sample of star-formation sup-
pressed HCG galaxies the energy introduced to the molec-
ular gas by shocks and turbulence is self-suﬃcient to stabi-
lize it against gravitational collapse, and therefore no AGN
feedback is necessary to explain the signiﬁcant suppression
of star formation observed.

4 DISCUSSION: A POSSIBLE

EVOLUTIONARY SEQUENCE FOR
GALAXIES IN GROUPS

Although the general belief about how galaxies age, whereby
LTGs deplete their gas content prior to their quench-
ing and the morphological transformation into ETGs (e.g.
Hopkins et al. 2006), the results of the current –as well as
several recent– studies suggest that reality is more com-
plicated. We showed that knowing the morphology of a
galaxy is not enough to infer its star formation activity
and colour. In addition, Alatalo et al. (2015b) concluded
that even knowing the molecular gas content of a galaxy
is not enough to deduce its star formation activity. We have
seen that in addition to tidal stripping, galaxies in compact
groups might also be subject to shocks and turbulence that
can signiﬁcantly alter their star formation activity. More-

over, we showed that the morphological transformation of
compact group late-type galaxies into earlier types occurs
not in the UV-optical green valley, as it is currently ac-
cepted, but rather in the mid-IR IRTZ. Based on these re-
sults, we present a new evolutionary scheme for galaxies in
groups. According to this, the evolution of member galaxies
is tightly connected with the dynamical evolution of their
group.

Initially, dynamically young groups contain mostly gas-
rich late-type galaxies. Later on, the frequent interactions
strip signiﬁcant amounts of gas out of their disks (i.e.
Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2001, reported HI deﬁciencies of
>40 per cent), and therefore to reduce their star forma-
tion activity. However, the gas in the central region of these
galaxies is less aﬀected by the tidal forces, and is not stripped
out easily. Therefore, some residual dust obscured star for-
mation may be present. This is supported by the fact that
cold dust appears less extended than stars in these galaxies
(Bitsakis et al. 2014). As a result, during this phase, galax-
ies will display red UV-optical but red mid-IR colours that
can explain the presence of the elbow seen in Fig. 3.

As the group evolves dynamically, increasing its veloc-
ity dispersion (∼408±50 km sec−1; Bitsakis et al. 2011) and
becoming more compact, galaxies will experience constant
harassment, with near-misses and in some cases direct colli-
sions at high speed that can introduce turbulence into their
ISM (the case of HCG 57; Alatalo et al. 2014b). Moreover,
the stripped gas will accumulate in the intra-group space.
This will result in the galaxies colliding with this medium.
These collisions can induce shocks and turbulence into their
ISM, as described in §3.4. Even though shocks are transient
phenomena (10-100 Myr), the frequency of the interactions
that trigger them can prevent the ISM of the galaxies from
relaxing. This will result in the suppression of star forma-
tion in these systems, the fading of which can also lead to
the appearance of the weak background AGN activity that
>40 per cent of these galaxies display (Martinez et al. 2010;
Sohn et al. 2013; Bitsakis et al. 2015). During that period
the frequent interactions will also transform the galaxies into
earlier type morphologies (as it is seen in the IRTZ; §3.2).
Although, initially that process is slow – with no signiﬁ-
cant changes occurring within the ﬁrst Gyr – the frequency
of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-debris interactions lead to its
acceleration (especially during the last 1-1.5 Gyr; §3.1, 3.2).

It is also likely that despite their morphology, these
early-type galaxies might contain considerable amounts of
ISM either from accretion and merging, or residual gas left
unable to further form stars because of the shocks. In cases
where the cooling processes had enough time to be com-
pleted, this will result into the re-ignition of star formation.
In those cases, the short-lived burst will change their colours
back to “green”. Eventually, star formation will cease and
these galaxies will move to the red galaxy sequence in the
bottom right corner of Fig. 3.

The above evolutionary scheme is consistent with the
idea that, although secular evolution is important in trans-
forming galaxies in the ﬁeld, it is only a minor eﬀect for
galaxies in compact groups, where the multiple interactions
that a given galaxy will experience during its lifetime will
aﬀect more drastically its evolution.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have studied the evolution of star formation
and the properties of the galaxies in compact groups, over
the past 3 Gyr. Our sample comprises 1770 compact groups
(containing 7417 galaxies) found at z=0.01-0.23, and it is the
largest multi-wavelength compact group sample to-date. To
estimate the properties of the galaxies we have ﬁtted their
UV-to-mid-IR spectral energy distributions with CIGALE.
Based on the analysis of these results we conclude that:

• The UV-optical and mid-IR colours of our galaxies as
well as their star formation activity, evolve diﬀerently from
galaxies in the ﬁeld and in clusters. We also observe a sig-
niﬁcant evolution of these properties with time, accelerating
towards lower redshifts. This change appears stronger for
galaxies in dynamically old groups.

• Late-type galaxies in compact groups found below the
star forming main sequence display the highest gas velocity
dispersions and excitation lines consistent with shocks. In
addition to gas stripping, shocks might also be responsible
for inhibiting the star formation in these systems.

• The morphological transformation of late-type galaxies
into earlier types occurs during their transition through the
mid-infrared green valley, rather than the UV-optical one.

• About 70 per cent of the early-type galaxies in com-
pact groups are located within the UV-optical green valley.
We rule-out the possibility that the UV-upturn has contam-
inated our SFR determination, and argue that it is due to
residual star formation.

• We propose an evolutionary scheme where, in addition
to gas stripping, the frequent and multiple interaction along
with turbulence and shocks, profoundly shape the morphol-
ogy and star formation activity of compact group galaxies.

APPENDIX A: REMOVING THE AGN CONTRIBUTION FROM THE PHOTOMETRY OF THE
GALAXIES

As described in §2, one of the parameters in the model we are using to ﬁt the observed SEDs of our galaxies, is the contribution
from an AGN power-law in the near- and mid-IR bands. This contribution can be speciﬁed using AGN Type-1, Type-2 or
intermediate type templates, as described in Ciesla et al. (2015), and can be considered only for AGN fractions of fAGN > 10
per cent. Using CIGALE we remove this contribution – where present – from our galaxies, and then with the use of specialized
IDL packages, we estimate their theoretical photometry. The results are shown in Fig. A1. We also perform Kolmogorov-
Smirnov analysis between the observed and AGN-removed WISE colours of the galaxies in each panel of this ﬁgure (presented
in Table A1). We can notice that no signiﬁcant changes occur between the observed (presented with solid contours) and the
theoretical colors (in dotted contours), with only exception ETGs in dynamically old groups at z>0.133. This result was
expected since, as already described in Bitsakis et al. (2015), there are no dust obscured AGN in our sample.

APPENDIX B: EVALUATING THE GAS VELOCITY DISPERSIONS

To test the validity of the results presented in Fig. 9, we plot in Fig. B1 the disk inclination of our galaxies, derived from the
radial proﬁle ﬁtting of Simard et al. (2011), as a function of the velocity dispersion of the forbidden lines. The results of this
test are also presented in the forth column of Table 4. As one can see there is no correlation between the velocity dispersion
of the forbidden lines and the inclination of the galaxies (especially in Regions 3 and 4) that would explain the enhancement
of the observer velocities to these regions due to the rotation of these galaxies. Performing a Spearman Rank test between
the inclination and the σF orbidden values, we ﬁnd signiﬁcance probabilities of 0.33, 0.08, 0.32 and 0.80 respectively (if less
than 0.01 there is a signiﬁcant correlation), suggesting that there is no correlation between the two parameters for any of the
four regions we are studying. These results support the conclusions of §3.4 that the velocity dispersion of the gas increases in
Regions 3 and 4 along with the higher excitation line ratios.
