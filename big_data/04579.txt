We study the eﬀect of impurity scattering eﬀect in black phosphorurene (BP) in this work. For
single impurity, we calculate impurity induced local density of states (LDOS) in momentum space
numerically based on tight-binding Hamiltonian. In real space, we calculate LDOS and Friedel os-
cillation analytically. LDOS shows strong anisotropy in BP. Many impurities in BP are investigated
using T -matrix approximation when the density is low. Midgap states appear in band gap with
peaks in DOS. The peaks of midgap states are dependent on impurity potential. For ﬁnite positive
potential, the impurity tends to bind negative charge carriers and vise versa. The inﬁnite impurity
potential problem is related to chiral symmetry in BP.

INTRODUCTION

Graphene has remarkable electronic, optical and me-
chanical properties and shows promising applications in
electronic devices.1 Since the successful procduction of
grpahene in 2004,2 there have been many studies on
graphene both experimentally and theoretically.1 How-
ever, due to its gapless spectrum, graphene is not a good
candidate for on-oﬀ devices.
It is desirable to ﬁnd 2-
dimensional materials with a tunable gap which can be
utilized as on-oﬀ devices. A promising candidate re-
ported in recent years is mono-layer BP which has a di-
rect band gap.3

Mono-layer BP has been fabricated in lab using exfo-
liation method.3 Since then, more and more works has
focused on single layer and few layer BP.4–10 Bulk BP
has a band gap of 0.31− 0.35 eV, and single layer BP has
a band gap of about 1.5 eV.3 Mono-layer BP has large
mobility as well as a band gap which makes it a promis-
ing material in electronic devices. It has diﬀerent masses
along armchair and zigzag direction respectively. This
anisotropy has great impact on its transport and optical
properties. For example, Tony Low et al6 studied the
plasmons in BP and found that the plasmon excitations
have diﬀerent dispersion along diﬀerent directions.

Impurity is introduced in processes of fabricating ma-
terials. So it is important to understand impurity eﬀects
in mono-layer BP because impurity can aﬀect properties
of devices remarkably.
Impurities could be introduced
in many ways. Substrates provide a source of impuri-
ties and the adsorbed atoms on BP or missing atoms in
BP can induce vacancies and so on.12 Impurities provide
scattering centers to carriers and are the main contribu-
tion to lifetime of carriers in the low-temperature limit.
We mainly focus on short-ranged impurities in this pa-
per.12 To understand impurities eﬀects in BP will provide
useful information about this new fabricated material.

To understand how impurity aﬀects carriers in BP,
it is necessary to study the density of states (DOS) of
carriers. The electronic DOS has many characteristics
showing presence of impurities. There are many phys-
ical properties closely related to DOS of carriers, such
as electric conductivity, optical conductivity, scanning-

tunneling microscope (STM) images. The DOS of carri-
ers is also related to the polarization of the system which
modiﬁes the electronic screening.

For a single impurity, the Fourier transform scanning
tunneling spectroscopy (FT-STS) which is Fourier trans-
formation of local density of states (FT-LDOS) can reveal
many informations about carriers13–17. The FT-STS are
interference patterns which originate from interference of
incoming waves and outgoing waves scattered by the im-
purity. The scattering occurs on contours of constant
energy and momentum is transferred from the impurity
to carriers, so the amplitudes in FT-STS can reveal what
kind of scattering can happen and also the properties of
the impurity. For example, the FT-STS in monolayer
graphene and bilayer graphene show diﬀerent signatures
which can be used to distinguish monolayer and bilayer
graphene.15 For surface states of 3-dimensional topolog-
ical insulator, the backscattering is forbidden. So in ex-
periment FT-STS amplitude is weak for the backscat-
tering which makes it a strong evidence for topological
insulator.17 Therefore, FT-STS is a useful method in ex-
periment to investigate material properties.

In real space, the disturbance of the impurity relocates
electrons, and the amplitude of LDOS oscillates and de-
cays away from the position of the impurity. So the elec-
tron density at position r which is obtained by summing
LDOS at r up to Fermi energy will oscillate and decay
in real space.
It is called Friedel oscillation (FO). In
graphene, FO has been studied in a series of papers.18,19
FO decays as r−3 in graphene, the oscillation wave vector
is 2kF with kF the Fermi surface wave vector.

For a ﬁnite but small density of impurities, peaks can
show up in DOS. The states associated with these peaks
are called midgap states because they appear in the band
gap.7 In graphene, the midgap states appear at Dirac
point where the DOS is zero.26 These midgap states can
be viewed as bound states attracted by impurity poten-
tial.

In this work, we ﬁrst study FT-STS in BP which is
caused by a single impurity, the numerical results are
based on four band tight-binding Hamiltonian in BP us-
ing T -matrix.20–26 This problem has been investigated in
graphene and in topological insulator,14,17 but the strong

anisotropy in BP has strong inﬂuence on FT-STS and it
is useful to study these anisotropy related eﬀects in BP.
We also investigate FO in real space based on two-band
model of BP.5 For the case of many impurities, we focus
on short-ranged and low density impurities. We present
calculations of DOS in BP using both T -matrix approxi-
mation (full Born approximation) and self-consistent T -
matrix approximation (full self-consistent Born approxi-
mation).24,25 T -matrix is exact for single impurity and is
a good approximation for many impurities as long as the
density is low and impurity is short ranged.25

II. HAMILTONIAN OF BP AND T -MATRIX

We start with our calculation using the tight-binding
model of monolayer BP. BP has the same structure as
graphene but with the atoms puckered. There are four
phosphorus atoms in the unit cell of BP shown in ﬁgure

fAD = t2e−ikxax + t5,
fBC = t2 + t5e−ikxax,
fBD = t4(1 + eikyay + e−ikxax + e−ikxax+iky ay ),
fCD = t1(1 + eikyay ) + t3(e−ikxax + e−ikxax+iky ay ) (2)

with ax, ay given in ﬁgure 1, A, B, C and D denote the
four atoms in unit cell. The tight-binding parameters
read as t1 = −1.220 eV, t2 = 3.665 eV, t3 = −0.205 eV,
t4 = −0.105 eV, t5 = −0.055 eV.11
In this work we assume the impurity is short ranged
and can be modeled as delta potential. In the vicinity
of Dirac point in graphene, long-ranged Coulomb im-
purity is the main source of scattering,12 while in BP
Coulomb impurity can be treated as short-ranged be-
cause of screening. So we mainly focus on short-ranged
impurity. The impurity potential written in k space is
assumed to be

U = u

where u is constant in k space. The only nonzero element
of U at ﬁrst row and ﬁrst column means the impurity is
near or resides on the single A atom.We take u → ∞
for vacancies. In the single impurity problem, we ﬁx the
position of the impurity in the ﬁrst unit cell and take the
impurity site as origin in real space. In the case of low
density concentration of impurities, we ﬁx the number of
impurities and their positions are randomly distributed
in the system. The ﬁnal results take the average of all
possible conﬁgurations of impurities. The Born approxi-
mation is often introduced in the calculation if u is small
and the impurity is short-ranged, but when bound state
is formed near the impurity, the Born approximation is
not justiﬁed.
In stead, T -matrix should be introduced
in calculation when bound states are formed.23 The T -
matrix is exact for single impurity for any value of u.
For low density concentration of impurities or vacancies,
the T -matrix approximation is also a good approxima-
tion.24 We also calculate the DOS using self-consistent
T -matrix approximation and ﬁnd that they do not make
big diﬀerences.

For a single impurity, the LDOS is obtained by taking
the imaginary part of full Green function. The full Green
function is carried out using T -matrix and Matsubara

For many impurities, we take the small density into
account, i.e. small ni = Ni/N , where Ni is the number
of impurities. We average over all possible positions of
impurities and approximate the Green function of car-
riers to ﬁrst order in ni using T -matrix approximation.
The Green function is

G(k, iωn) = G0(k, iωn) + G0(k, iωn)T (iωn)G(k, iωn),

which can be solved as

G(k, iωn) = [(G0(k, iωn))−1 − T (iωn)]−1.

In the above equations, T -matrix is T (iωn) =
U ni[1 − U G
If we use the self-consistent T -
matrix approach, T -matrix becomes T (iωn) = U ni[1 −
U G(iωn)]−1, where G(iωn) = 1/NPk G(k, iωn). The
diﬀerence between T -matrix approximation and self-
consistent T -matrix approximation is that T -matrix uses
the zeroth-order Green function while the latter uses the
full Green function in calculating T (iωn).

III. FT-STS FOR A SINGLE IMPURITY

It is necessary at beginning to clarify some issues re-
lating to experiments and conditions under which our
approach is appropriate. FT-STS is related to Fourier
transformed LDOS ρ(ri, iωn) with ri the position of unit
cell. The experimental situation is complicated. If the
tip of STM has high resolution, then the LDOS related to
the 4 atoms can be detected respectively. If the resolution

is low, the LDOS detected may bePX=A,B,C,D ρXX (ri).

In our work we calculate ρAA(ri) for simplicity. In the
zero temperature limit, it is assumed that all other in-
teractions, inelastic scattering can be incorporated into
the broadening for simplicity. The reason is that in the
low temperature limit, inelastic scattering is suppressed,
the electron-electron interaction is screened and Landau’s

Fermi liquids picture is valid.

The FT-LDOS is equation (10) which is a convolution
integral essentially. The steps in numerical calculation
based on tight-binding model are as follows: The
zeroth order Green function in k-space at right hand of
equation (4) is Fourier transformed to real space, and we
obtain G0(E + iη, ri) and G0(E + iη, −ri) respectively,
then Fourier transform their products back to k-space
including appropriate coeﬃcients.

Before the presentation of numerical results, we dis-
cuss how the scattering process inﬂuence the interference
pattern in FT-STS and do some analytical calculations.
First, the energy is conserved because the impurity is
time-independent, namely, scattering between states oc-
curs on the same energy contour. Second, from equation
(4), it is easily obtained that the dominant contribution
to FT-STS is where energy ω is close to the two poles of
the two Green function simultaneously. The associated
quantity is also called joint DOS.13 Following T. Pereg-
Barnea et al,16 we use the k· p Hamiltonian and consider
E lying in conduction band taking into interband cou-
pling as renormalzation of conduction eﬀective masses,
the Green function to ﬁrst order in u has the form

calculation, the broadening of levels cause FT-LDOS in
regions outside this contour nonzero. It is clear that the
largest part lies on this contour.

The numerical result is shown in ﬁgure 2 with (a)
E = 0.3 eV, (b) E = 0.7 eV, (c) E = 1.5 eV and (d)
E = 2.5 eV. The scattering occurs on the contours of
constant energy and the results show that large ampli-
tude of FT-LDOS comes from scattering exchanging mo-
mentum q = 2kE with kE corresponding to wave vector
on energy contour of E. There is only intraband scatter-
ing in BP while in graphene scattering can happen be-
tween two nonequivalent K points. However, BP shows
strong anisotropy in FT-STS. The prominent feature is
that the constructive interference occurs on elliptic con-
tours which is consistent with equation (16). The re-
sulting FT-LDOS in BP is diﬀerent from graphene. In
graphene, FT-LDOS has a circle around Γ and six trig-
onal contour around six vertex point of BZ,14 while in
BP, the contour is around Γ and its shape is elliptic due
to diﬀerent masses in two directions. This largest part
of FT-LDOS in BP is backscattering where momentum
transfer is two times Fermi wave vector, i.e. the scatter-
ing just reversed the wave vector.

interference patterns in-

on energy contour and q variable. This small contribu-
tion also exists in FT-LDOS in graphene, but the isotropy
in energy dispersion makes this part is the same in all di-
rections and it will not emerge. In BP, this small part
has diﬀerent values in diﬀerent directions, and the large
part emerges. The incoming waves interference with the
outgoing waves after scattering which is called FO in real
space. We will make detailed studies on it in next sec-
tion. The strong anisotropy in FT-STS of BP makes the
pattern more easily identiﬁed in STM experiments.

where subscript c(v) label the conduction (valence) band,
ηc,v and νc,v are related to the eﬀective masses by η(c,v) =
¯h2/2m(c,v)x, ν(c,v) = ¯h2/2m(c,v)y, the mass parameter
are mcx = 0.151me, mcy = 1.062me, mvx = 0.122me,
mvy = 0.708me with me the free electron mass. Ec =
0.34 eV (Ev = −1.018 eV) is the conduction (valence)
band edge, γ = −5.231 eV · ˚A is interband coupling co-
eﬃcient. This Hamiltonian can be obtained from tight-
binding Hamiltonian by low-energy expansion to second
order of k near Γ point based on D2h symmetry of BP.5
The k·p Hamiltonian has strong anisotropic masses along

the x and y directions and we will use it to calculate FO
in BP.

We brieﬂy describe how to obtained equation (18) from
tight-binding Hamiltonian (1) here. The details can be
found in references 5 and 11. The eigenvector of tight-
binding Hamiltonian (1) is given by [φAφBφC φD]. Using
unitary transformation

the tight-binding Hamiltonian can be reduced to a block
diagonal Hamiltonian with each block a 2×2 Hamiltonian
of which the eigenvector is

Ψ =

√2(cid:18) φA + φC

φB + φD (cid:19) .

(20)

So BP can be described by a 2 × 2 Hamiltonian. After a
rotation of the Pauli matrices τx 7→ τz followed by τy 7→
τx,5 this 2 × 2 Hamiltonian is transformed into equation
(18). Under this rotation, the impurity potential U is
transformed into

U = u/√2(cid:18) 1 −i
i 1 (cid:19) .

In this sec., we use Born approximation which is
enough for calculating FO. To ﬁrst order in U, the mod-
iﬁed Green function in real space is

From equation (27), it is seen that FO is anisotropic
in BP. The oscillating part in the numerator is due to
discontinuity at the Fermi surface. We conclude this
section with comparing FO in BP to that in graphene.
In graphene, the FO decay as r−3 due to cancelation of
modes on neighboring sites which decay as r−2.19 How-
ever, there is no such cancelation happening in BP be-
cause of the large gap.
In BP, the FO shows similar
behavior to ordinary 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)
which shows r−2 behavior. Due to diﬀerent masses of car-
riers in x and y directions, FO in BP oscillates anisotrop-
ically in x and y direction.

V. LOW DENSITY OF IMPURITIES

After the investigation of single-impurity problem, we
turn to many-impurity problem in this section. For low

density impurities which are short ranged and have ﬁ-
nite amplitude, Born approximation is often suﬃcient.
However, to study midgap states in band gap induced by
impurities, Born approximation is not appropriate and
we use T -matrix instead. Impurity is the main source of
life time for carriers in the low temperature limit, there-
fore it is useful to calculate the impurities induced DOS.
We ﬁrst study the problem of impurities with u → ∞,
then the t4 = 0 problem is considered. Next ﬁnite v case
is investigated. At last, we study impurities which have
amplitude on all four sites for completeness.

Before detailed analysis of numerical results, it is worth
understanding the origin of midgap states. For single im-
purity, it is seen from equation (4) that impurity induced
bound states comes from poles of Timp(E). For many im-
purities with small density, it will be seen midgap states
are related to poles of T (iω) in equation (12). Remember
that for low density impurity, T -matrix approximation is
(E + iη)]−1. The DOS
justiﬁed and T (E) = U ni[1− U G
is
ρX (E) = −1/N πIm[Xk

GXX(k, E + iη)]

with X denotes A, B, C or D and G(k, E + iη) is given
in equation (13). If there is no impurity, BP has crystal
symmetry D2h and DOS on A (B) is equal to C (D).5

The DOS is related to poles of Green function. Midgap
states come from new poles associated with impurity. Ex-
panding right hand side of equation (13) to ﬁrst order in
ni, i.e. G = G0 + G0T (iω)G0, it is seen that new poles
come from T (iω). The midgap states appear at E satis-
fying

det[I − V Xk

G0(k, E + iη)] = 0

(29)

just as bound states appear for a single impurity to ﬁst
order in ni, we denote the solution of this equation as
Eimp.
It is worth noting that our analysis is not suit-
able for long-range or high-density impurities where the
interference eﬀect is important.

We compute numerically the DOS in BP in the pres-
ence of impurities. The site dependent DOS is obtained
from equation (28). We ﬁrst consider impurities of the
form of equation (5) and take the limit u → ∞. As shown
in ﬁgure 3, we plot DOS on A, B, C and D site in BP
separately. As we see in ﬁgure 3, the DOS on A [ﬁgure
3(a)] atom shows little evidence of bound states while
DOS on B [ﬁgure 3(b)] has midgap states. The limit
u → ∞ means decoupling the atom A from the system,
the states belonging to the missing A atoms now have
zero amplitude on site A and bound states may emerge.
The DOS on C and D shows similar behavior to DOS
on A and B respectively, the reason of which is that A
(B) atom is connected to C (D) atom through small next
nearest neighbor t4 so the midgap state tend to stay on
B and D atom.

To get more deep understanding of midgap states in
BP, we note that the midgap states in BP are similar

FIG. 4. DOS on site A, B, C and D respectively with t4 = 0
and u → ∞. With t4 = 0, BP preserves chiral symmetry due
to which vacancies have bound states exactly at E = 0 eV

to midgap sates in graphene in the presence of vacan-
cies.
In graphene, that the midgap states in the pres-
ence of vacancies appear near E = 0 eV is due to chiral
symmetry of graphene Hamiltonian. Chiral symmetry in
graphene is a symmetry is deﬁned as σ3Hσ3 = −H where
σ are Pauli matrices acting on pseudo-spin.20 Due to chi-
ral symmetry, if there is a state at energy ε, then there
is also another state at energy −ε. For every k, there are
two eigenstates for the graphene Hamiltonian H(k) with
ε and −ε respectively. If one atom is decoupled from this
Hamiltonian, then only one state is allowed to exist and
this state must appear at ε = 0 eV.

Midgap states in BP can also be explained in this way

FIG. 5. DOS on A, B, C and D respectively at u = 10 eV.
For ﬁnite u, DOS on A and C have ﬁnite amplitudes. The
position of peaks move towards valence bands compared to
u → ∞.

For ﬁnite u, DOS on A and C have ﬁnite amplitudes. The
position of peaks move towards conduction bands compared

because BP regains chiral symmetry if we set t4 = 0 eV.
To see it more clearly, we start from 2 × 2 Hamiltonian
in reference [5] which reads

H2×2 =(cid:18) fAC

h∗

h

fAC (cid:19) ,

(30)

where h is given in reference [ 5] whose detailed expres-
sion is not relevant here. The Hamiltonian (30) has chi-
ral symmetry if we set t4 = 0 eV. So the midgap states
should appear near E = 0 eV if t4 = 0 eV, we verify this
by plotting DOS on A, B, C, and D sites respectively
in BP where we have omitted t4. The DOS is shown in
ﬁgure 4. As expected, midgap states appear near E = 0
eV which is similar to graphene. So midgap states in BP
given t4 nonzero also should exist except they are shifted
by an energy interval due to the nonzero t4.

For ﬁnite u, the position Eimp of midgap states shows
diﬀerent behaviors for positive u and negative u. We plot
u = 10 eV and −10 eV in ﬁgure 5 and 6 respectively. As
already discussed before, impurity density does not af-
fect position of midgap states though it may introduce
new energy scales nu and nW with W the width of band.
Impurity density only aﬀects heights of peaks. Position
Eimp is determined by u. Positive u intend to bound neg-
ative electrons or positive holes while negative u attracts
positive electrons. Note that there is a little diﬀerence
between DOS on A and on C (also between B and D).
The reason is that the presence of impurity at A break
D2h symmetry and A is not equivalent to C in the pres-
ence of impurity which reside on site A.

For completeness we study the DOS in the presence of
impurities which reside on all four sites, that is to say,

which has the same amplitude on all four sites. As shown
in ﬁgure 7 there is no midgap states in the gap if we take
u → ∞, the DOS on the four sites are the same so we
present DOS on A only. The impurity reside on all four
site in a unit cell so there is no site left to host a bound
state with ﬁnite energy. For ﬁnite u, there is a solution
Eimp to equation (29).
If Eimp lies between the gap,
midgap states will appear.21 On the other hand, if the
solution Eimp lies in the bands, the impurity will modify
the DOS in the bands and no midgap states is induced.7
At last self-consistent T -matrix is used to calculate
DOS. Self-consistent T -matrix is also called full self-

FIG. 8. Self-consistent T -matrix calculation of impurity of
the form in equation (5). We set u = 10 eV as in ﬁgure
5. Self-consistent calculation takes ﬁnite life time of carriers
into account, so the width of peaks is larger than results using
zeroth Green function.

consistent Born approximation, it replaces the full Green
function with zeroth order Green function in calculation
of T -matrix. The same impurity problem as in ﬁgure 5
is calculated again using self-consistent T -matrix here.
The numerical result is shown in ﬁgure 8. There is no
essential diﬀerence from T -matrix approximation which
is shown in ﬁgure 5, the position of Eimp is not changed
and amplitude is also proportional to height of peaks.
But there are some diﬀerences indeed. The height and
width of peaks have changed.
It can be explained as
follows, self-consistent calculation treats the imaginary
parts of self energy more exactly, so the width of peaks
in this approach is more reliable.

ference between incoming and outgoing waves forms pat-
terns in FT-STS. The largest part of the interference am-
plitude comes from backscattering in FT-STS. Because
of anisotropy in BP, there are two features: one is that
contours in FT-STS is elliptic, the other is that small
contours appear in the inside of large contours. FO also
shows anisotropy in oscillation and decaying directions.
FO in BP is diﬀerent from graphene in that it decays as

For the many-impurity problem, we calculated DOS
in BP and found that midgap states appear in the band
gap. The position Eimp of midgap states is related to am-
plitude of impurity potential u. The density determines
the height of peaks. The midgap states appear at E = 0
for u → ∞ when t4 is set to zero, which is due to chiral
symmetry of BP Hamiltonian in the absence of t4. For ﬁ-
nite u, the impurity site tends to bind negative (positive)
charge carriers for positive (negative) v. We also calcu-
lated DOS using self-consistent T -matrix approximation
and found the width of peaks is larger than DOS using
T -matrix approximation.

In this work we have assumed the zero-temperature
limit. We have omitted inelastic scattering due to
phonons and electron-electron interactions.
Indeed, at
ﬁnite temperature, phonon mediated scattering is no
longer energy conserved and it may have large eﬀect on
FT-STS. The states over a wide range of energy may take
part into scattering process and the phase space for scat-
tering is enlarged compared to zero-temperature limit.
So the phonon scattering may not be ignored in FT-
STS at ﬁnite temperature. For electron-electron inter-
action, it has shown in graphene electron-electron inter-
actions has strong inﬂuence on carriers near Dirac point
in graphene.27 The Fermi velocity will be reshaped and
even gap is opened at Dirac point due to exiton condensa-
tion.27 So it is expected that electron-electron may have
inﬂuence on DOS in BP.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

We have discussed impurity problem in BP. For a sin-
gle impurity we calculated FT-STS in momentum space
and FO in real space. Numerical results of FT-STS is
based on four band tight-binding Hamiltonian while FO
is analytically calculated based on 2 × 2 k · p Hamilto-
nian. The scattering is elastic so wave function will get
phase shift after scattering. Due to phase shift, the inter-
