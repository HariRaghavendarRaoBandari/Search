An improvement on the trivial lower bound

for the depth of a centerline

Alexander Magazinov∗, Attila Pór

March 8, 2016

1 Introduction

Let α be a k-ﬂat and µ a probability measure in Rd (0 ≤ k < d ). Deﬁne the depth
of α as follows:

depthµ(α) = inf{µ(H) : H is a closed half-space, α ⊂ ∂H }.

To distinguish with other notions of depth, the above deﬁned depth is some-
times called half-space depth or Tukey depth. We will write simply depth(α) if
the measure is clear from the context.

Throughout the paper we will deal only with probability measures. Thus we

will omit the word “probability”, however, keeping it in mind.

Bukh, Matoušek and Nivasch [2] proposed the following conjecture:

Conjecture 1.1. Let (d , k) be a pair of integers with 0 ≤ k < d . Then for every
measure µ in Rd there exists a k-ﬂat α in Rd (a centerﬂat) such that

depth(α) ≥

k + 1

k + d + 1

.

(1)

The conjecture is true for k = 0 (Radó’s centerpoint theorem, 1946, see [6]),

k = d − 1 (trivial), and k = d − 2 (due to Bukh, Matoušek and Nivasch [2]).

A result by Klartag [5] implies that, if d − k is ﬁxed, then for every ε > 0, with
d sufﬁciently large depending on ε, and for every measure µ in Rd there exists
a k-ﬂat α in Rd such that

depth(α) >

− ε.

One can see that for k = 0 and k = d − 1 the constant

k+1
k+d +1 in (1) cannot be

increased. This is also the case for k = 1, as shown by Buch and Nivasch [3].

Radó’s centerpoint theorem implies that for every d , k and µ as above one

can ﬁnd a k-ﬂat α such that

depth(α) ≥

1

d − k + 1

.

(2)

(In fact, such a k-ﬂat exists in any k-dimensional direction.) The bound of (2)
will be called the trivial bound.

It may be also convenient to think about a depth of a ﬂat in terms of projec-
tions. If µ is a measure in Rd , and α is a k-ﬂat, we will write πβ for the projection
from Rd onto Rd −k along α. Let µα be a projection of µ along α, i.e., a measure
in Rd −k such that for every Borel set X ⊆ Rd −k one has

Then for the point o = πα(α) one has the identity

µα(X ) = µ(π−1

α (X )).

depthµα

(o) = depthµ(α).

In this paper we prove that for k = 1 the trivial bound (2) is not optimal,

except for the case d = 2. Namely, we have the following result:
Theorem 1.2. For every d ≥ 3 and for every probability measure µ in Rd there
exists a (1-dimensional) line ℓ with

depth(ℓ) ≥

1

d

+

1
3d 3

.

(3)

We emphasize that there is still a huge gap between the inequality (3) we

were able to prove, and the conjectured inequality (1).

Theorem 1.2 also implies that the trivial bound (2) is optimal only for the

cases k = 0 and k = d − 1, as stated in the following corollary.

Corollary 1.3. For every d ≥ 3, every k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ d − 2 and every proba-
bilistic measure µ in Rd there exists a k-dimensional ﬂat α with

depth(α) ≥

1

d − k + 1

+

1

3(d − k + 1)3

.

Proof (reduction to Theorem 1.2. Choose an arbitrary (k−1)-dimensional ﬂat β.
After projecting along β onto Rd −k+1 we can apply Theorem 1.2. Namely, we
conclude that there is a line ℓ ⊂ Rd −k+1 such that

depthµβ

(ℓ) ≥

1

d − k + 1

+

1

3(d − k + 1)3

.

To ﬁnish the proof it is enough to put

α = π−1

β (ℓ).

2 Outline of the proof

First, it will be convenient for us to prove Theorem 1.2 for the (d +1)-dimensional
space rather than for the d -dimensional. Next, we aim for a proof by contradic-
tion. Therefore we assume that for every one-dimensional direction ℓ no point
of the (d -dimensional) plane πℓ(Rd +1) has depth

a0 = a0(d + 1) =

1

d + 1

+

1

3(d + 1)3

or greater.

Topological setup. We write RP d for the space of all one-dimensional direc-
tions Rd +1 as this is indeed the real projective space.

Let ξ = (E , RP d , p) be the quotient tautological bundle over RP d . That is,
for every ℓ ∈ RP d the ﬁber p −1(ℓ) is Rd = πℓ(Rd +1). Hence we can assume that
p −1(ℓ) is equipped with the measure µℓ.

We prove that there is no (d +1)-fold space cover E ′ ⊂ E with a certain prop-
erty (namely, that the origin of each ﬁber p −1(ℓ) is contained in the convex hull
of the (d + 1)-point set p −1(ℓ) ∩ E ′; see Section 8). Hence, if any assumption
allows us to construct such E ′, then the assumption is false.

Nice measures. We will call a measure nice, if it has an everywhere positive
density, and the density function decreases at least as an exponent of radius.
We supply the space of nice measures with a metric — the L1 distance between
density functions. If a measure µ is nice, then every its projection µα is nice,
and also µα is continuous with α.

In the proof of Theorem 1.2 we will assume that µ is nice. Then the case of

an arbitrary µ will follow from a standard approximation argument.

Centerpoints of measures µℓ. We show that each µℓ has a unique center-
point, i.e., a point at the largest depth. In the proof we use that all points of
p −1(ℓ) have small depth with respect to µℓ. We put the origin of each ﬁber at its
centerpoint (it is possible, because we show the continuity of the centerpoint).
The necessary lemmas concerning the centerpoint of a measure are proved in
Section 3.

Generating (d + 1)-tuples of half-spaces. Let Rd = p −1(ℓ) be a ﬁber and 0 its
origin. If a (d + 1)-tuple of closed half-spaces

H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1 ⊆ Rd

3

satisﬁes

then we call it generating.

Hi = 0,

d +1

\i =1

For such a (d + 1)-tuple of half-spaces we can consider the corresponding

(d + 1)-tuple of simplicial cones

namely,

B1, B2, . . . , Bd +1,

Bi = \1≤j ≤d +1

j 6=i

H j .

(4)

Clearly, different (d + 1)-tuples of half-spaces generate different (d + 1)-tuples
of simplicial cones.

A generating (d + 1)-tuple of half-spaces is said to have weight a, if

min

i

µℓ(Hi ) = 1 − a.

Generating (d + 1)-tuples of small weight. A generating (d + 1)-tuple of half-
spaces is, informally, a (d + 1)-tuple with weight equal to 1
d +1 or only slightly
greater. In Section 4 we pay special attention to generating (d + 1)-tuples of
small weight. Indeed, as we prove in Section 3, such (d +1)-tuples exist in every
ﬁber p −1(ℓ).

We show that all generating (d + 1)-tuples of small weight are in a certain
sense similar to each other. For instance, given an order for one such (d + 1)-
tuple, a natural order for all other such (d + 1)-tuples can be introduced. More-
over, a natural order is spanned for generating (d + 1)-tuples of small weight in
p −1(ℓ′) if ℓ′ is close enough to ℓ.

In Section 5, given a measure µ and a convex
Constructing the space cover.
d -dimensional convex cone C in Rd , we deﬁne the central vector of C . This
deﬁnition is used to obtain a space cover E ′ ⊂ E . The argument goes roughly
as follows. Given a ﬁber p −1(ℓ) consider all generating (d + 1)-tuples of small
weight, and take the i -th cone Bi (H ) corresponding to each such (d + 1)-tuple
H . Then average the central vector of Bi (H ) over all H . This would give the
i -th point of the set E ′ ∩ p −1(ℓ). All the details are provided in Section 7.

3 The centerpoint of a measure

If µ is a nice measure in Rd , then depth(x), considered as a function of a point
x ∈ Rd , is continuous. Since the limit of depth(x) is zero at inﬁnity, then depth(x)
attains its maximal value.

Given a nice measure µ, call a point o a centerpoint if

depth(x) ≤ depth(o)

for all x ∈ Rd .

We are going to prove the uniqueness of the centerpoint, provided that its
depth is small. The idea of such statement is certainly not new, see, for in-
stance, [1].

If n ∈ Rd is a unit vector, denote by H(n) the half-space such that the origin
0 belongs to ∂H(n) and n is the outer normal to ∂H(n), i.e., n is orthogonal to
∂H(n) and is directed outwards the half-space H(n).

Lemma 3.1. Let 0 ≤ ε <
depth(0) = a, then

1

3(d +1)3 , a = 1

d +1

+ ε.

If 0 is a centerpoint of µ and

1. There exists a generating (d + 1)-tuple of half-spaces H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1 of

weight a.

2. 0 is the unique centerpoint of µ.

Proof. Deﬁne N to be the set of all unit vectors n ∈ Rd such that µ(H(n)) = a.
Clearly, the set N is compact.

Assume that 0 ∉ conv N . Then conv N can be split from 0 by a plane. Or,

equivalently, there exists a unit vector v such that

〈n, v 〉 > 0.

inf
n∈N

This is impossible, since for small enough δ > 0 we have depth(δ · v ) > a.
Indeed, if we translate µ by a vector −δ · v , then depth(0) increases. The reason
is that translation of µ by −δ · v increases the measure of each H(n) for all n in
some open neighborhood of N and does not sufﬁciently decrease the measure
of all other half-spaces with 0 in the boundary. The contradiction shows that
0 ∈ conv N .

The Carathéodory principle implies that

0 ∈ conv{n1, n2, . . . , nk }

(ni ∈ N , 2 ≤ k ≤ d + 1).

We claim that k = d + 1. Indeed, by the choice of ni we have

µÃ k
\i =1

H(−ni )! = 0,

5

because the intersection is a (d +1−k)-dimensional afﬁne plane through o. But
this is not possible for k ≤ d , because

µ(H(−ni )) = 1 − a > 1 −

1
d

.

Consequently, the (d + 1)-tuple of half-spaces

H(−n1), H(−n2), . . . , H(−nd +1)

is generating and has weight a. Assertion 1 is proved.

For assertion 2, let o 6= 0. For some i we have o ∈ int H(ni ). Then for the

half-space H such that

o ∈ ∂H , ∂H ⊥ni ,

and H ⊂ H(ni )

we have µ(H) < µ(H(ni )) = a. Hence depth(o) < a.

Now let the measure µ change. Recall that we consider the space of nice
probability measures in Rd with L1-distance between density functions as the
metric. Notice that for every measurable set X one has

|µ(X ) − µ′(X )| ≤ k fµ − fµ′kL1.

Here fµ and fµ′ denote the density functions of the respective measures.

Lemma 3.2. Let o(µ) denote a centerpoint of µ. Assume that µ0 is a measure
such that

depthµ0(o(µ0)) <

Then

1

d + 1

+

3(d + 1)3 .

1. o(µ) is unique for all µ in some neighborhood of µ0.

2. depthµ(o(µ)) is continuous with µ at the point µ = µ0.

3. o(µ) is continuous with µ at the point µ = µ0.

Proof. Without loss of generality, let o(µ0) = 0. Let also depthµ0(o) = a.

If

k fµ − fµ0 kL1 <

1

d + 1

+

1

3(d + 1)3

− a,

then, for the measure µ, every point in Rd has depth less than 1
d +1
Application of Lemma 3.1 yields assertion 1.

3(d +1)3 .

Further,

a − k fµ − fµ0kL1 = depthµ0(0) − k fµ − fµ0kL1 ≤ depthµ(0)

≤ depthµ(o(µ)) ≤

depthµ0(o(µ)) + k fµ − fµ0 kL1 ≤ depthµ0(0) + k fµ − fµ0 kL1 = a + k fµ − fµ0 kL1.

(5)

Hence assertion 2 follows.

According to Lemma 3.1, there is a generating (d + 1)-tuple of half-spaces

H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1

of weight a, and thus µ0(Hi ) = 1 − a.

For any open ball U ⊂ Rd such that 0 ∈ U there exists a set of half-spaces

H ′

2, . . . , H ′

d +1

such that

∂Hi ∥ ∂H ′

Suppose that o = o(µ) ∉ S. According to (5), depthµ(o(µ)) > a − δ

2 . On the other

depthµ(o) ≤ µ(Rd \ H ′

i ) ≤ µ0(Rd \ H ′

a contradiction. Thus o(µ) ∈ S ⊂ U . But U is arbitrary, so o(µ) is continuous.

4 Generating (d + 1)-tuples of half-spaces

In this section we prove several auxiliary facts concerning generating (d + 1)-
tuples of cones.

Recall that a generating (d +1)-tuple of half-spaces generates a (d +1)-tuple

of simplicial cones according to formula (4).

7

Lemma 4.1. Let

be a generating (d + 1)-tuple of half-spaces and

H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1

B1, B2, . . . , Bd +1

the corresponding (d + 1)-tuple of simplicial cones. Let for each i a point bi ∈
int Bi be chosen. Then conv{b1, b2, . . . , bd +1} is a non-degenerate d -simplex, and

0 ∈ int conv{b1, b2, . . . , bd +1}.

Proof. For each plane ∂Hi denote by ni the unit normal vector directed out-
wards Hi . We have

0 ∈ int conv{n1, n2, . . . , nd +1},

(6)

otherwise

Hi 6= {0}.

d +1

\i =1

By construction, for every i 6= j we have

〈bi , ni 〉 > 0,

(cid:173)bi , n j® < 0.

Now we argue by contradiction. Assuming that the statement of lemma is
false, there is a plane α that separates 0 from every bi . (The separation need not
be strict.) If n is the normal vector to α pointing towards the open half-space
without any bi , then

Due to (6), we may assume without loss of generality that

〈bi , n〉 ≥ 0 for all i .

n = λ1n1 + λ2n2 + . . . + λd nd ,

where λi ≥ 0 and not all αi are zero. Then

〈bd +1, n〉 = λ1 〈bd +1, n1〉 + λ2 〈bd +1, n2〉 + . . . + λd 〈bd +1, nd 〉 < 0,

a contradiction.

Lemma 4.2. Let ε ≤

H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1

be the respective (d + 1)-tuples of simplicial cones. Then there is a permutation

Let

(Bi , B ′

j ) ∈ E (G) ⇐⇒ µ(Bi ∩ B ′

We claim that G is a perfect matching. First we prove that G has a perfect

matching as a subgraph.

Assume that there is no perfect matching in G. According to Hall’s marriage
lemma, we may assume, up to a permutation of indices, that B1, B2, . . . , Bm are
connected only with B ′

Since

,

this is a contradiction. Hence G contains a perfect matching.
Up to a permutation of indices we can assume that (Bi , B ′

i ) ∈ E (G) for each

i . Next we show that no other edge of G exists.

Without loss of generality assume that (B1, B ′

2) ∈ E (G). Choose a point b1 ∈

int B1 ∩ B ′

2. For each i > 1 choose a point bi ∈ Bi ∩ B ′
i .

We have bi ∈R Bi for each i . Hence, by Lemma 4.1,

0 ∈ int conv{b1, b2, . . . , bd +1}.

On the other hand,

0 ∉ int H ′

1 ⊃ conv{b1, b2, . . . , bd +1},

a contradiction. Therefore G is exactly a perfect matching.

5 The central ray of a simplicial cone

In this section µ denotes a nice measure in Rd .

Let B be a simplicial cone in Rd with vertex 0. For α ∈ (0, 1] deﬁne

H (B, α) = {H : H is a half-space, 0 ∈ ∂H, and µ(H ∩ B ) ≥ αµ(B )}.

Choose an arbitrary unit vector n such that 〈n, b〉 > 0 for every b ∈ B \ 0.

Since B contains no straight line, such n exists.

Consider the central projection πc of Rd with the center at 0 onto the plane

Deﬁne the probability measure µc in the plane Π as follows:

Π = {y :(cid:173)n, y® = 1}.

µc (X ) =

Let H be a half-space in Rd such that ∂H is not orthogonal to n. Then H ∩ Π

is a half-space in Π and

If α ≥ d −1

d , then, by Radó’s theorem,

µc (H ∩ Π) = µ(H ∩ B ).

(H ∩ Π) 6= ∅.

where d x is the standard volume form in Sd −1. We will call e(B ) the central
vector of B , and the ray along e(B ) the central ray of B .

Emphasize that e(B ) is a unit vector, and that e(B ) ∈ C (B ).
For the next proposition we do not give an explicit proof, but rather notice

that the proof does not require any non-standard arguments.

Proposition 5.1. C (B ) and e(B ) change continuously with a continuous change
of µ and B .

Remark. Actually, we need to deﬁne a continuous change of a cone. To do this,
it is enough to deﬁne a basic neighborhood of a cone. Given C (B ), choose an
arbitrary pair of closed convex cones Ci nt and Cext such that

Ci nt ⊂ intC (B ), C (B ) ⊂ intCext .

Then Ci nt and Cext span the following basic neighborhood of C (B ): the set of
all closed cones C satisfying

Basic neighborhoods of B are deﬁned in a similar way.

Ci nt ⊂ intC , C ⊂ intCext .

We will also need the following Lemma 5.2 and Corollary 5.3.

Lemma 5.2. Let B and B ′ be simplicial cones, both with vertex 0. Suppose that

.

B ⊇ C (B ′) and B ′ ⊇ C (B ).

Proof. The conditions are symmetric for B and B ′, so it is enough to prove that
B ⊇ C (B ′). Let C (B ′) \ B 6= ∅. Then there exists a half-space H such that

0 ∈ ∂H, B ⊂ H,

and C (B ′) \ H 6= ∅.

But we have

Hence C (B ′) ⊂ H by deﬁnition of C (B ′). A contradiction.

e(B ) ∈ B ′ and e(B ′) ∈ B.

Hence our main result, Theorem 1.2 says that for a measure µ in Rd +1 there
exists a line with depth a0 or greater. We remind that µ is considered to be nice
(see the deﬁnition in Section 2) because of a standard approximation argument.
In this section we assume that the statement of Theorem 1.2 is false. That
is, for every direction ℓ ∈ RP d of a line in Rd +1 the projected measure µℓ is such
that no point in Rd has depth a0 or greater.

Recall that we consider the quotient tautological bundle ξ = (E , RP d , p).
Each ﬁber p −1(ℓ) is isomorphic to Rd and can be treated as the domain for the

13

projected measure µℓ. Due to the uniqueness and continuity of the centerpoint
under our assumptions (Lemma 3.2), we can set the origin of the ﬁber p −1(ℓ)
to be the centerpoint of µℓ.

for each ℓ ∈ RP d .

Given ℓ ∈ RP d and a ∈ (0, 1), consider the ﬁber p −1(ℓ) with the measure
µℓ. For these ﬁber and measure, denote by Rℓ(a) the family of all (unordered)
generating (d + 1)-tuples of half-spaces with weight at most a.

Rather than the family Rℓ(a) of unordered (d + 1)-tuples we want to have a

family R∗

ℓ (a) of ordered (d + 1)-tuples with the following natural properties.

(R1) There is a bijection between Rℓ(a) and R∗

of the same half-spaces.

Hence R∗

ℓ(a) meets the required conditions.

One can notice that the proof above leads to the following.

Proposition 6.2. If a family R∗
ℓ(a) satisﬁes the conditions (R1) and (R2), then
any other family satisfying these conditions is obtained by choosing an arbitrary
permutation σ and applying it to each element of R∗

ℓ(a).

In the hypothesis of the next Lemma 6.3 we are given a direction ℓ ∈ RP d ,
its neighborhood U0 ⊂ RP d , and an isomorphism p −1(U0) ∼= U0 × Rd . The iso-
morphism is required to match each p −1(ℓ′) to {ℓ′}×Rd , and the set of origins of
ﬁbers to U0 × {0}. (Notice that such an isomorphism always exists if U0 is small
enough.)

Let t : U0 × Rd → Rd be the projection that erases the U0-coordinate. Then
ℓ′(a), which is deﬁned in p −1(ℓ′) (∼= ℓ′ × Rd ) has a natural counter-
ℓ′ (a)) in Rd , the image space of t . A measure µℓ′ in p −1(ℓ′) has also a

the family R∗
part t (R∗
counterpart µt

ℓ′ in Rd .

Lemma 6.3. Let a direction ℓ ∈ RP d , its neighborhood U0 ⊂ RP d , and an iso-
morphism p −1(U0) ∼= U0 × Rd be as above. Then there is a neighborhood U ⊂ U0
of ℓ and a choice of order for each R∗

ℓ′ (a1) (ℓ′ runs through U ) such that

t (R∗

ℓ′(a1)) ⊂ t (R∗

ℓ(a0)).

15

Proof. Let, fℓ′ : Rd → R+ denote the density function of the measure µt
U ⊆ U0 small enough to satisfy

ℓ′. Choose

k fℓ′ − fℓkL1 < a0 − a1

for every ℓ′ ∈ U .

If ℓ′ ∈ U and a half-space H ⊂ Rd satisﬁes µt
Therefore we have

ℓ′ (H) ≤ a1, then µt

ℓ(H) < a0.

whenever

(H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1) ∈ Rℓ(a0)

(H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1) ∈ Rℓ′ (a1).

For each (d +1)-tuple from Rℓ′(a1) choose the same order as in R∗

ℓ(a0). The
resulting family of ordered (d + 1)-tuples satisﬁes the conditions (R1) and (R2)
above and therefore is suitable to be R∗

ℓ′ (a1).

Let us consider the set of all (d +1)-tuples of half-spaces in Rd with 0 on the
boundary. We can consider it as (Sd −1)d +1 with the natural topology. We will
need the following lemma, formalizing the fact that generating (d +1)-tuples of
small weight are far enough from non-generating (d + 1)-tuples.

Lemma 6.4. For every ℓ ∈ RP d , 0 < a ≤ a0 the set R∗

ℓ(a) is compact.

Proof. Throughout the proof the notation relates to the space p −1(ℓ) and the
measure µℓ.

Let the sequence

(H

( j = 1, 2, . . .) converge and

As bi is separated from the boundary of C (Bi ), there exists δ > 0, indepen-

dent of j , such that for any 1 ≤ i , i ′ ≤ d + 1, i 6= i ′ one has

〈n(Hi ), bi 〉 ≥ δ,

〈n(Hi ′), bi 〉 ≤ −δ.

By Lemma 4.1,

0 ∈ int conv{b1, b2, . . . , bd +1}.

Hence, if H ∗
i

is a half-space such that bi = n(H ∗

i ), then the (d + 1)-tuple

(H ∗

1 , H ∗

2 , . . . , H ∗

d +1)

is generating. Let

(B ∗

1 , B ∗

2 , . . . , B ∗

d +1)

be the corresponding (d + 1)-tuple of simplicial cones. Then one has

n(Hi ) ∈ intB ∗
i .

Lemma 4.1 immediately yields

0 ∈ intconv{n(H1), n(H2), . . . , n(Hd +1)}.

Hence the (d + 1)-tuple

(H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1)

is generating and has the corresponding (d + 1)-tuple

(B1, B2, . . . , Bd +1)

of simplicial cones.

By continuity of the weight function, the (d + 1)-tuple

(H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1)

17

has weight at most a.

Finally, suppose that

(H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1) ∉ R∗

ℓ(a).

Then there is a non-trivial permutation σ such that

(Hσ(1), Hσ(2), . . . , Hσ(d +1)) ∈ R∗

ℓ(a).

Due to the property (R2), for each j = 1, 2, . . . we have

Taking the limit yields

which is impossible. A contradiction shows that

(H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1) ∈ R∗

ℓ(a).

Thus R∗

ℓ(a) is closed and hence compact.

7 Constructing the hypothetical (d +1)-fold space cover

E ′ ⊂ E (ξ)

We continue the argument using the assumptions and the notation of the pre-
vious section.

Let ℓ ∈ RP d and

(n1, n2, . . . , nd +1)

be an arbitrary (d +1)-tuple of unit vectors in p −1(ℓ). (Note that the space of all
such (d +1)-tuples is (Sd −1)d +1.) If Hi is a half-space of p −1(ℓ) such that 0 ∈ ∂Hi
and ni is the outer normal to ∂Hi , and the (d + 1)-tuple

(H1, H2, . . . Hd +1)

is generating, then we write weightℓ(n1, n2, . . . , nd +1) for the weight of that (d +
1)-tuple of half-spaces.

18

Let R∗

ℓ(a1) satisfy the properties (R1) and (R2) from the previous section.
ℓ(a1) according to Lemma 6.1,

(That means, we have (d + 1)! candidates for R∗
but we choose one of them, and ﬁx the choice for the next deﬁnition.)

Now we deﬁne the vector function

ei (ℓ, n1, n2, . . . , nd +1) : RP d × (Sd −1)d +1 → p −1(ℓ).

The deﬁnition will consist of two mutually disjoint cases.
Case 1. (H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1) ∉ R∗

ℓ(a1). Put

ei (ℓ, n1, n2, . . . , nd +1) = 0.

Case 2. (H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1) ∈ R∗

ℓ(a1). Put

ei (ℓ, n1, n2, . . . , nd +1) =¡a1 − weightℓ(n1, n2, . . . , nd +1)¢e(Bi ),

where (B1, B2, . . . , Bd +1) is the (d + 1)-tuple of simplicial cones corresponding to
the generating (d + 1)-tuple (H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1).

Now we are ready to deﬁne the (d + 1)-tuple of vectors E ′ ∩ p −1(ℓ). Namely,

the i -th element of the (d + 1)-tuple is deﬁned as follows:

ei (ℓ) = Z(Sd −1)d +1

ei (ℓ, n1, n2, . . . , nd +1) d n1d n2 . . . d nd +1.

(7)

We emphasize that the ordered (d + 1)-tuple

(e1(ℓ), e2(ℓ), . . . , ed +1(ℓ))

depends on the choice of R∗
ordered (d + 1)-tuple

ℓ(a1) from (d + 1)! possible variants, but the un-

{e1(ℓ), e2(ℓ), . . . , ed +1(ℓ)}

does not.

In order to continue, we ﬁrst clarify the notation. Consider an arbitrary di-
rection ℓ0 ∈ RP d . Then there is a small neighborhood U0 of ℓ0 such that there
exists an isomorphism between p −1(U0) and U0 × Rd . We will consider the pro-
jection

t : p −1(U0) ∼= U0 × Rd → Rd

that drops the U0-component of the Cartesian product. Further, reduce U0 to
a smaller neighborhood U1 ⊆ U0 of ℓ0 so that one can choose R∗
ℓ(a1) for each
ℓ ∈ U1 consistently in the sense of Lemma 6.3.

There is a map

ˆei : U1 × (Sd −1)d +1 → Rd

19

acting as follows. The input is ℓ ∈ U1 and d + 1 unit vectors

ˆn1, ˆn2, . . . , ˆnd +1 ∈ Rd .

If n j ∈ p −1(ℓ) is such that t (n j ) = ˆn j , then

ˆei = t ◦ ei (ℓ, n1, n2, . . . , nd +1).

Lemma 7.1. The map ˆei is continuous.

Proof. As this will cause no ambiguity, write ei instead of ˆei , µℓ instead of t (µℓ)
and R∗
ℓ(a)). In other words, we treat the measures µℓ and
the families R∗

ℓ(a) as objects placed in the same Rd .

ℓ(a) instead of t (R∗

Consider the two cases.

Case 1. ei (ℓ, n1, n2, . . . , nd +1) = 0. If, as before, H j is a half-space with outer
normal n j and 0 ∈ ∂H j , then there are four subcases.
Subcase 1.1. (H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1) is not a generating (d +1)-tuple. Then Lemma 6.4
immediately implies that any (d + 1)-tuple close enough to (H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1)
cannot belong to R∗
ℓ0

ℓ′ (a1) for any ℓ′ ∈ U1. Thus

(a0), and hence to R∗

ei (ℓ′, n′

2, . . . , n′

d +1) ≡ 0

for any ℓ′ ∈ U1 and any (n′
Subcase 1.2. weightℓ(n1, n2, . . . , nd +1) > a1. Then for any (ℓ′, n′
close enough to (ℓ, n1, n2, . . . , nd +1) we have

d +1) close enough to (n1, n2, . . . , nd +1).

and, consequently,

ei (ℓ′, n′

1, n′

2, . . . , n′

d +1) ≡ 0.

Subcase 1.3. There exists a non-trivial permutation σ such that

Then

and, therefore,

(Hσ(1), Hσ(2), . . . , Hσ(d +1)) ∈ R∗

ℓ(a1).

(Hσ(1), Hσ(2), . . . , Hσ(d +1)) ∈ R∗
ℓ0

(a0),

(H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1) ∉ R ∗
ℓ0

(a0).

The rest of the argument goes as in Subcase 1.1.
Subcase 1.4. (H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1) ∈ R ∗
ℓ (a1), weightℓ(n1, n2, . . . , nd +1) = a1. Then,
of course, the (d + 1)-tuple (H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1) is generating, and so are all close

20

enough (d + 1)-tuples of half-spaces. Moreover, for any δ > 0 we can restrict
ourselves to (ℓ′, n′

d +1) close enough to (ℓ, n1, n2, . . . , nd +1) so that

2, . . . , n′

1, n′

weightℓ′(n′

1, n′

2, . . . , n′

d +1) > a1 − δ.

The last inequality implies

kei (ℓ′, n′

1, n′

2, . . . , n′

d +1)k < δ,

which is sufﬁcient since δ is arbitrary.
Case 2. e j (ℓ′, n1, n2, . . . , nd +1) 6= 0.

Let, as above, (B1, B2, . . . , Bd +1) be the (d + 1)-tuple of simplicial cones cor-
responding to the generating (d + 1)-tuple (H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1), and C (B j ) — the
central cone of B j with respect to the measure µℓ.

Given δ > 0, choose two closed convex cones Ci nt and Cext such that

1. Ci nt ⊂ intC (Bi ), C (B j ) ⊂ intCext

2. For every convex cone C such that Ci nt ⊆ C ⊆ Cext one has

ke − e(Bi )k ≤ δ,

respectively.

Under all the conditions above, we have

As a consequence, given δ > 0, we have found a neighborhood of (ℓ′, n1, n2, . . . , nd +1)

such that e j changes at most by 2δ.

Lemma 7.2. The (unordered) (d + 1)-tuple

{e1(ℓ), e2(ℓ), . . . , ed +1(ℓ)}

depends continuously on ℓ.

Proof. Since Cauchy and Heine deﬁnitions of continuity are equivalent in our
case, we will use the latter.

Consider an arbitrary sequence {ℓ j } → ℓ. By Lemma 7.1, the sub-integral
function for ℓ j in (7) pointwise converges to that of ℓ. Hence ei (ℓ j ) converges
to ei (ℓ) by the Bounded Convergence Theorem (see, for example, [7, Section
4.2]).

Lemma 7.3. If ℓ ∈ RP d , Rd = p −1(ℓ), and 0 is the origin of Rd , then

0 ∈ conv{e1(ℓ), e2(ℓ), . . . , ed +1(ℓ)}.

(8)

Proof. Let (H1, H2, . . . , Hd +1) ∈ R∗
(d + 1)-tuple of simplicial cones.

ℓ(a1). Let B1, B2, . . . , Bd +1 be the corresponding

Choose an arbitrary (d + 1)-tuple

(if weightℓ(n′

2, . . . , n′

d +1) ∈ intC (B ′

22

(10)

Therefore either (9) or (10) holds for all possible

(n′

d +1) ∈ (Sd −1)d +1,

1, n′

2, . . . , n′

and, due to choice of a1, (10) holds in a set of positive measure.

Consequently, (7) implies that

ei (ℓ) ∈ intBi .

Applying Lemma 4.1, we immediately get (8).

8 Final topological argument

Lemma 8.1. Let d ≥ 2, ξ = (E , RP d , p) be the tautological quotient bundle. Then
there is no (d + 1)-fold space cover E ′ ⊂ E such that for every ℓ ∈ RP d

1. The simplex S(ℓ) = E ′ ∩ p −1(ℓ) is non-degenerate.

2. The origin of the ﬁber p −1(ℓ) is an interior point of S(ℓ).

Proof. Suppose that such E ′ exists. Since π1(RP d ) = Z2, then E ′ splits into 1-
fold and 2-fold subcovers.

We will show then that in each case ξ admits a non-vanishing section. That
is, there exists F ⊂ E such that p |F is a homeomorphism from F to RP d , and for
every ℓ ∈ RP d the point F ∩ p −1(ℓ) is not the origin of the ﬁber p −1(ℓ).

If there is a 1-fold subcover F ⊂ E , then it is a non-vanishing section itself. If

there is a 2-fold subcover G ⊂ E ′, then for each ℓ ∈ RP d deﬁne

f (ℓ) = g1 + g2,

where {g1, g2} = G ∩ p −1(ℓ).

(The sum of vectors is well deﬁned in the ﬁber p −1(ℓ).) Put

F = { f (ℓ) : ℓ ∈ RP d }.

Since d ≥ 2, and g1 and g2 are two vertices of the simplex S(ℓ), which contains
the origin inside, the sum g1 + g2 cannot vanish. Hence F is a non-vanishing
section.

Now notice that, if η is the tauological line bundle over RP d , then ξ ⊕ η is

trivial. Hence for the corresponding Stiefel-Whitney classes we have

sw (ξ)sw (η) = 1

23

in H ∗(RP d , Z2) = Z2[x]/(xd +1), where x ∈ H 1(RP d , Z2). But sw (η) = 1 + x, so
sw (ξ) = 1 + x + . . . + xd . (See the details, for example, in [4].)

Hence the top (d -th) Stiefel-Whitney class of ξ is non-zero. Therefore ξ can-

not have a non-vanishing section, a contradiction.

Remark. The present version of Lemma 8.1 was suggested by R. Karasev and
works for every dimension. For all dimensions, except d = 3 and d = 7 one can
consider the tangent bundle of Sd with an embedded (d + 1)-fold cover. This
gives d + 1 afﬁnely independent vector ﬁelds in Sd (and therefore d linearly
independent vector ﬁelds), which is also impossible.

Now we are ready to ﬁnish the proof of our main result.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. We will write d + 1 rather than d for the dimension of the
space. Assume that for some measure µ in Rd +1 no line has depth

a0 =

1

d + 1

+

1

3(d + 1)3

or more.

Due to a standard approximation argument, we can assume that the mea-
sure µ in Rd +1 is nice (every measure can be approximated with nice measures).
For the quotient tautological bundle ξ = (E , RP d , p) perform the construc-

tion from Section 7 to obtain E ′ — a (d + 1)-fold space cover of RP d .

On the other hand, by Lemma 7.3 and Lemma 8.1 such a space cover cannot

exist, a contradiction.
