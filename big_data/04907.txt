ABSTRACT

Recent X-ray observations of star-forming galaxies such as M82 have shown the
Lyβ/Lyα line ratio of Ne X to be in excess of predictions for thermal electron impact
excitation. Here we demonstrate that the observed line ratio may be due to charge
exchange and can be used to constrain the ion kinetic energy to be . 500 eV/u.
This is accomplished by computing spectra and line ratios via a range of theoretical
methods and comparing these to experiments with He over astrophysically relevant
collision energies. The charge exchange emission spectra calculations were performed
for Ne10++ H and Ne10++ He using widely applied approaches including the atomic
orbital close coupling, classical trajectory Monte Carlo, and multichannel Landau-
Zener (MCLZ) methods. A comparison of the results from these methods indicates
that for the considered energy range and neutrals (H, He) the so-called “low-energy
ℓ-distribution” MCLZ method provides the most likely reliable predictions.

INTRODUCTION

solar

X-ray emission from various
system environ-
ments (Cravens 2000; Lisse et al. 1996; Dennerl 2010;
Krasnopolsky et al. 2004) such as comets and planetary at-
mospheres (Dennerl et al. 2002) has been attributed to de-
excitation of highly excited product states following the
process of charge exchange (CX). Observations have sug-
gested that CX could be a signiﬁcant contributor to X-ray
emission outside the heliosphere, such as in supernova rem-
nants (Katsuda et al. 2011; Cumbee et al. 2014), starburst
galaxies (Liu et al. 2011), and extragalactic cooling ﬂows
(Fabian et al. 2011; Lallement 2004).

Within an environment in which both ions and neu-
tral atoms or molecules are present, CX can occur and may
dominate the ion emission spectra. During a collision, the
ion X q+ captures an electron from a neutral atom creating
a highly excited ion X (q−1)+(nℓ 2S+1L) that then emits one
or more photons in a cascade down to the ground state. To
accurately model the X-ray emission spectrum and hence
better understand neutral and ion density distributions, ion
temperatures, and ion charge state distributions in the envi-
ronments considered, it is essential to include the dominant

collisional processes, including CX, electronic recombination
and excitation, and photonic excitation for diﬀerent relevant
ion and neutral interactions.

For example, X-ray line emission has been shown to be
prominent in observations of hot plasma environments, and
Lallement (2004) and Konami et al. (2011) have suggested
that line emission in M82 may partially be due to CX in
which a highly ionized plasma collides with cold gas (see
also Zhang et al. 2014). Speciﬁcally, Konami et al. (2011)
suggest that CX emission from Ne X may make a signiﬁ-
cant contribution to the spectra. A better understanding of
the CX emission of Ne X in this environment could help
constrain ion and neutral densities in M82 as well as give
insight into what other environments CX is prominent.

Here we compare CX X-ray emission due to Ne10+ colli-
sions with H and He using a number of theoretical methods.
In the case of He, X-ray spectra are compared to a previous
experiment that used a coincident X-ray - ion charge state
and momentum detection approach that allowed determina-
tion of the charge exchange product state. Computed Lyman
series line ratios are compared to the Ne X Lyβ/Lyα ratio
in the disk of M82 and are found to be consistent with a CX
interpretation.

2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

2.1 Charge-Exchange Cross Sections

Cross sections for Ne10+ with H and He for capture to
state-resolved Ne9+(nℓ 2L) levels have been calculated us-
ing the classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC), atomic-
orbital close-coupling (AOCC), and multi-channel Landau-
Zener (MCLZ) methods. While both collision systems have
been studied for many decades (e.g., Schultz & Krsti´c 1995;
Liu et al. 2014), none of the previous studies have presented
a comprehensive set of state-resolved cross sections over a
range of energies relevant to astrophysics. The Ne10++ H
CX cross sections discussed in this paper are shown in Fig-
ure 1 for the dominant capture channel n = 6. Details of
the current MCLZ cross section calculations used here are
summarized in Lyons et al. (2016).

The AOCC method for the description of ion-atom colli-
sion processes is discussed in detail elsewhere (Fritsch & Lin
1991). We shall only outline it brieﬂy here. For a one-electron
two-center collision system the total electron wave function
is expanded over the traveling atomic orbitals centered on
each of the two centers (nuclei of the projectile ion and of
the target ion). Here, the determination of electronic states
centered on the target and on the projectile, is performed
by using the variational method with even-tempered trial
functions (Kuang & Lin 1997; Reeves 1963). The total elec-
tron wave function Ψ can be expanded in terms of atomic
orbitals, each multiplied by a plane wave electron trans-
lational factor (thus giving a traveling atomic orbital Ψ).
Inserting Ψ into the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
of the collision system, one can get the ﬁrst-order coupled
equations for the amplitudes centered on each of the nuclei.
After solving the coupled equations, one obtains the tran-
sition amplitudes, whose squared moduli at inﬁnitely large
times give the transition probabilities and from them the
state-selective CX cross sections that were computed for ki-
netic energies between 1 and 200 keV/u.

The CTMC method solves an n-body problem (i.e., con-
sisting of a projectile ion, target nucleus and inactive target
electrons, and active target electrons) by solving the classi-
cal Hamilton’s equations for a large ensemble of projectile-
target conﬁgurations (“trajectories”) to simulate ion-atom
collisions (Abrines & Precival 1966; Olson & Salop 1977).

The trajectories sample initial electronic orbitals pre-
pared to emulate the quantum mechanical electronic mo-
mentum distribution. At the end of the trajectory, at some
asymptotic distance, relative classical binding energies be-
tween particles are computed and used to ascertain whether
a reaction (charge exchange, excitation, or ionization) oc-
curred. In the case of charge exchange to produce Ne9+, the
ﬁnal nℓ quantum state is determined based on the binding
energy and classical angular momentum of the electron, if
bound to the projectile ion, following classical-quantum bin-
ning rules (Beckar & MacKellar 1984). Cross sections for H
collisions were obtained between 0.1 and 200 keV/u.

2.2 X-ray Spectra

In order to predict CX-induced spectra, a low density,
steady-state radiative cascade model was applied as de-
scribed by Rigazio, Kharchenko, & Dalgarno (2002). In this

model, the initial state populations are proportional to the
quantum-state-resolved CX cross sections. As the electron
cascades down to the lowest energy level, obeying quantum
mechanical selection rules, photons are emitted, including
X-rays.

When the initial charge q of the ion X q+ is greater
than ∼3, the electron will be primarily captured into an
excited state that decays to a lower state, such as the
ground state, and emits at least one photon. In the case
of Ne10++H that produces the hydrogen-like ion Ne9+ pri-
marily in the principal quantum level n = 6 (see, for exam-
ple, Krasnopolsky et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2014), the elec-
tron can be captured to any orbital angular momentum state
from ℓ = 0 (6s) to ℓ = 5 (6h) with a range of probabilities. In
the case that the electron is captured to the 6p state of Ne9+,
it will primarily decay to the 1s ground state emitting a 1322
eV X-ray photon, the Lyǫ line. In another case in which the
electron is captured to the 6h state, it can only decay by
a series of ∆ℓ = ∆n = −1 Yrast transitions that result in
infrared and visible photons. When the electron arrives at
the 2p level, it will decay to the ground state emitting the
1020 eV Lyα line. Lyβ, Lyγ, and Lyδ lines will also be pro-
duced from the cascade resulting from capture to other 6ℓ
states. While n = 6 is the dominant manifold for electron
capture with H, there are also signiﬁcant probabilities for
capture to n = 7 and n = 5 followed by cascade and X-ray
emission. Therefore, to fully predict the X-ray spectrum of
Ne9+ following CX collisions with H, or similarly with He,
requires knowledge of many nℓ-resolved cross sections.

While the basic CX process has been studied for
decades, the existing data are lacking in uniform reliabil-
ity, in coverage of projectile/target combinations, and in en-
ergy ranges relevant to astrophysics. Measurements of state-
selective cross sections (i.e., resolved by n and/or ℓ) are rare
and diﬃcult to perform. The energy resolution is typically
poor or the studies are restricted to the measurements of a
few ﬁnal states due to limited detector wavelength ranges.
Improvements have been made with experiments to directly
measure the X-ray spectrum (Greenwood et al. 2001), but
the measurement is of the total spectrum including the pho-
tons from all routes of the cascade. Hence, to directly de-
termine state-selective cross section data, one must turn to
theoretical methods. For product ions with more than one
electron, or for collisions on He, the status and reliability
of calculated cross sections is generally lower than for H.
Therefore, there is a need for measured cross sections and
for an estimation of them via empirical methods in addition
to theoretically predicted results.

In this paper, spectra were obtained for Ne10+ CX col-
lisions with H and He for a range of kinetic energies. For
Ne10++H CX, cross sections from the AOCC, CTMC, and
MCLZ methods are adopted. For the MCLZ method, cal-
culations were performed using the low energy and statis-
tical ℓ-distributions described in equations (15) and (16)
of Janev et al. (1983) (see also Krasnopolsky et al. 2004;
Smith et al. 2014). It is necessary to utilize ℓ-distribution
functions with MCLZ calculations for product H-like ions
(i.e., bare projectiles). Due to degeneracy of a given n-level
in a non-relativistic electronic description, only direct n-
resolved MCLZ computations are possible (Abramov et al.
1977). Calculations for Ne10+ + He CX were performed us-
ing only the MCLZ method here, with both the low energy

and statistical ℓ-distributions as with H. Nevertheless, the
present (and previously published) AOCC and CTMC data
for Ne10++ H CX, applicable primarily at higher impact
energies than of astrophysical relevance in nebular environ-
ments, are instructive for comparison with MCLZ calcula-
tions in order to assess their reasonableness in the range
of energies where they have overlapping applicability with
CTMC and AOCC. We note below the existence of CTMC
data for Ne10++ He CX presented previously in Ali et al.
(2010).

Among the theoretical methods for the energy range
and ion-atom systems considered here, at lower energies,
the MCLZ low energy ℓ-distribution is expected to describe
the CX mechanism most accurately. Spectra are shown in
Figure 2 for Ne10+ CX with H and He at collisional energies
of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 keV/u using this method.1 For Ne10+ CX
with H, as the collisional energy increases, the relative inten-
sities of the Lyβ and higher lines show a slight increase. For

Ne10+ CX with He, the trend is similar for the Lyγ line, but
reverses for the Lyδ line. The variation, however, is small.
Further, the Lyǫ line is practically missing for Ne10++ He
as the dominant n capture channel for CX with He is typ-
ically one smaller than for CX with H. Figure 3 shows the
similar spectra using the MCLZ statistical distribution. The
trends are the same for CX with both H and He, however, for
He, the higher Lyman lines have signiﬁcantly smaller inten-
sities giving a softer total X-ray spectrum. The statistical
distribution is likely not valid at this low collision energy.
Figures 4-5 show the CTMC, AOCC, and MCLZ low en-
ergy and statistical ℓ-distribution spectra for 1-20 keV/u.
The most notable diﬀerence in comparison to the MCLZ re-
sults using the low-energy ℓ-distribution is the decrease in
the Lyǫ line for all methods.

At higher energies (above ∼1-10 keV/u,) the statistical
ℓ-distribution2 is expected to be more realistic in describing

1 All line intensities are normalized such that Lyα has an inten-
sity of 1 and in most cases a Gaussian line-proﬁle with a resolution
of 10 eV full-width half-maximum (FWHM) is adopted.

2 The statistical model assumes that the internal states are pop-
ulated according to their degeneracy which results from strong
rotational mixing at small internuclear separation. Close internu-
clear distances become accessible for large kinetic energies.

CX emission than the low energy ℓ-distribution. Figure 6
shows the CX emission for Ne10+CX with He measured using
simultaneous cold-target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy
and X-ray spectroscopy as described in Ali et al. (2010)
at 4.55 keV/u. The experimental single electron capture
(SEC) CX emission is compared to spectra obtained with
the CTMC (Ali et al. 2005) and AOCC (Liu et al. 2014)
methods at the same energy, and the MCLZ low energy and
statistical ℓ-distributions at 4.8 keV/u. Both MCLZ meth-
ods provide a better ﬁt to the experimental data than the
CTMC or AOCC methods at this energy. The MCLZ statis-
tical ℓ-distribution results in slightly smaller Lyβ and higher
lines, while the MCLZ low-energy ℓ-distribution results in
slightly larger Lyβ and higher lines. At this resolution, the
Lyβ and Lyγ lines are not clearly resolved in the theoretical
spectra.

In addition to SEC, observed and experimental X-ray
emission spectra often contain contributions from multiple
electron capture (MEC), including double capture with sub-
sequent autoionization (DCAI) and transfer ionization (TI).
Emission from states populated by a combination of these
reaction channels may be present in astrophysical spectra.
Figure 7 shows a comparison of DCAI to SEC for Ne10+CX
with He using the CTMC method (Ali et al. 2005). While
TI has an insigniﬁcant contribution in the present ion-atom
systems at low collision energy, DCAI is shown to give a
contribution of 21% of the total spectrum for the CTMC
method. However, Table 1 in Ali et al. (2005) shows that
the experiment suggests a smaller 12% fraction of MEC,
which agrees with the MCLZ method from that work. This
small fraction of MEC to the total CX emission suggests
that ignoring MEC in Ne10+CX in an observed spectrum
and assuming that SEC is dominant is justiﬁable when con-
sidering He as the CX target, though exceptions for other
ions are possible.

2.3 Line Ratios

The ratio of the intensity of the Lyβ and higher lines to the
Lyα line vary for diﬀerent processes and for diﬀerent colli-
sion energies3. These ratios can give insight into what pro-
cesses may be occurring within astrophysical environments,
including, but not limited to, extracting the collisional en-
ergies and ion abundance ratios. Figures 8-9 show the ratios
of Lyβ/Lyα calculated over diﬀerent collisional energies us-
ing the four diﬀerent methods described in §2.1. Because the
astrophysical environments of present interest contain both
neutral H and He, line ratios for the collisions of Ne10++H
(Fig. 8), He (Fig. 9), and for the assumed fraction of 90% H
and 10% He (Fig. 9 for the MCLZ calculations) are shown.
the MCLZ statistical ℓ-
distribution and AOCC line ratios are almost equal at
1 keV/u, and are relatively consistent between 1 and 10
keV/u. The CTMC method is very similar to the AOCC
results for the range of 10-50 keV/u considered. The MCLZ
low energy ℓ-distribution method, however, gives a line ratio

For Ne10+ CX with helium, MCLZ cross sections have
been computed in the present work down to low energy
(∼100 eV/u) and CTMC results at one impact energy (4.5
keV/u, Ali et al. 2010) are available from previous work,
though they could easily be extended to higher and lower

3 APPLICATION TO M82

In Figures 8-9, the Lyβ to Lyα ratios for Ne10+ CX with
H and He are overlaid with line ratio observations (verti-
cal lines) for M82 from Suzaku described by Konami et al.
(2011). The observations give the Ne9+ Lyβ to Lyα ratio
for four diﬀerent regions in M82; the Disk, Wind-1, Wind-2,
and Wind-3. In their Figure 8, Konami et al. (2011) showed
that the line ratios for the three Wind regions can be repro-
duced by a collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) model,
but the Disk region cannot. The Lyβ to Lyα ratio from the
CIE model is signiﬁcantly smaller at ∼0.1 than the observed
Disk line ratio (∼0.25), indicating that the line ratio in the
Disk might be primarily due to CX. Assuming that CX has
a signiﬁcant contribution to the spectrum of M82, the col-
lisional energies at which the Lyβ to Lyα line ratios cross
the observed line ratio from Konami et al. (2011) gives a
constraint on the ion kinetic energy in M82.4

Figures 8 and 9 show that the MCLZ low energy ℓ-
distribution line ratios agree with the Disk region observa-
tion by Konami et al. (2011) for H and He over a wide range

4 The Ne IX Kβ line at 1074 eV may partially overlap the ob-
served Ne X Lyα line contaminating the line ratio. The Kβ is
expected, however, to account for less than ∼5% of the Ne IX
emission and the removal of its contribution would only enhance
the Lyβ/Lyα ratio.

Figure 8. Line ratios (Lyβ/Lyα) for the three methods shown in
Figures 3-5 as a function of collisional energy for charge exchange
of Ne10+ with H. The vertical lines represent the Disk, Wind-1,
Wind-2, and Wind-3 regions of M82 as described by Konami et al.
(2011). The results from the ACX model (Zhang et al. 2014) are
also shown. Note that the results from Konami et al. (2011) and
Zhang et al. (2014) have no ion kinetic energy dependence and
their placement on the right side of the plot is arbitrary.

of ion energies (0.1 to 5 keV/u), while the CTMC line ra-
tio for H approaches the observational result near 0.1 keV/u.
The MCLZ low energy ℓ-distribution is over an order of mag-
nitude higher than all other methods for the entire energy
range in Figure 8, making it fall within the range of the Disk
line ratio for M82. As postulated above, the transition from
statistical to a low-energy ℓ-distribution occurs between 0.1
and 1 keV/u, because the low energy ℓ-distribution Lyβ to
Lyα ratio curve lies within the Disk region uncertainty, we
can postulate that the ion kinetic energy in the disk is likely
.0.5 keV/u (300 km/s).

In the more unlikely case that all of the atomic H in
the Disk region has been ionized leaving only neutral He,
Figure 9 shows that again the Lyβ/Lyα ratio predicted by
the MCLZ cross sections with the low-energy ℓ-distribution
gives best agreement. The MCLZ statistical distribution for
He predicts line ratios in agreement with the Suzaku obser-
vation for ion velocities of ∼950-2000 km/s (1-10 keV/u).
Likewise, the measurements of Ali et al. (2010) performed
at 930 km/s are also consistent with the Disk observation,
but these high ion velocities likely cannot be produced in
starburst outﬂows. The CTMC and AOCC He results un-
derestimate the observation by a factor of ∼3 at the energy
for which data are available, namely, about 4.5 keV/u, which
is considerably larger than the estimated 0.5 keV/u identi-
ﬁed above as the likely maximum ion energy that is relevant
to CX in the Disk region.

Considering CX from both H and He, but with abun-
dance fractions of 90% and 10%, respectively, again the
MCLZ low-energy distribution result agrees best with the
observations in the Disk region. For all other methods, He
target contributions increase the predicted Lyβ/Lyα ratio,
but only to ∼0.1 at 4.55 keV/u (930 km/s).

Using XMM-Newton observations with its Reﬂection

MNRAS 000, 1–8 (2016)

Grating Spectrometer (RGS), Zhang et al. (2014) mod-
eled the X-ray spectrum of M82 assuming a two compo-
nent model consisting of hot single-temperature thermal
plasma emission (electron-impact excitation) and CX emis-
sion. They found that the Ne X Lyα line intensity can be
reproduced if 19% of the emission is due to CX. However,
the RGS spectrum covers the entire disk and outﬂow of
M82 (i.e., Disk, Wind-1, Wind-2, and Wind-3 regions of
Konami et al. 2011). This is consistent with the suggestion
of Konami et al. that the Wind components can be mod-
eled with thermal emission, while the Disk is dominated
by CX emission, the latter conﬁrmed here. Further, the
CX contribution in Zhang et al. (2014) was obtained with
the AtomDB Charge eXchange (ACX) model (Smith et al.
2012) that adopted the so-called separable ℓ-distribution.
The low-energy distribution peaks at ℓ = 1, while the sep-
arable distribution peaks at ℓ = 2 for Ne10+ that results in
the ACX Lyβ/Lyα ratio of 0.176, shown in Figure 8. This
line ratio is somewhat smaller than the observed Disk ratio
of ∼0.28 with Suzaku, but consistent with total line ratio of
0.182 Zhang et al. (2014) measured with the RGS. However,
one must remember the XMM-Newton/RGS measurement
includes all regions of the Disk and outﬂow.

To reproduce the observed Disk Lyβ/Lyα ratio assum-
ing only CX emission, our modeling suggests that the rel-
ative ion velocity is .300 km/s, independent of whether a
10% He component is included. While superwind models of
the M82 outﬂow typically adopt velocities greater than 1000
km/s, Zhang et al. (2014) suggest that a reasonable approx-
imation is closer to ∼500 km/s. Finally, a further test of the
contribution of CX to the X-ray emission could be made by
modeling the Lyδ and Lyǫ emission at 1308 and 1325 eV,
respectively. Figure 2 suggests that both line intensities (for
H) are larger than or comparable to that of Lyβ. The Lyǫ
to Lyδ ratio could be used to constrain the neutral He to H
fraction given the negligible Lyǫ emission for Ne10+ + He
collisions. In fact, there is some hint of this feature in the CX
modeling of Zhang et al. (2014), though blending of the Mg
XI Kα forbidden line may contaminate the Ne lines. Higher
resolution spectra, such as with Hitomi will better resolve
the emission lines and allow for better constraints on the
contribution of Ne X CX. A more thorough model, using for
example, XSPEC (Arnaud et al 1996), should be performed
including H and He-like C, N, O, Ne, Mg, and Si and Fe
XVII ions colliding with H and He targets, similar to the
approach of Zhang et al. (2014), but with reliable CX data.
Such a comprehensive approach would help in determining
the contribution of various mechanisms including, collisional
excitation (CIE), radiative recombination, CX, or other pro-
cesses such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity.

4 CONCLUSIONS

As shown here via our comparison of results of various
conventional theoretical approaches, the MCLZ low-energy
ℓ-distribution is likely the better method for producing
Ne10+CX line ratios with H and He below 5 keV/u. The
statistical distribution may be used above 1 keV/u, but the
AOCC method is preferred. As the AOCC and CTMC meth-
ods have agreement between 10 and 50 keV/u, either method
would work, but as the Lyǫ lines (due to H) are similar for

Ne X X-ray Emission due to Charge Exchange

the MCLZ statistical and AOCC methods for this energy,
the AOCC approach is likely more accurate.

The current charge exchange modeling of the Ne X X-
ray emission for the Disk of the starburst galaxy M82 sug-
gests that CX may account for the observed Lyβ/Lyα ra-
tio, a ratio that is not consistent with thermal emission due
to electron-impact excitation. Further, the emission may in-
clude contributions from CX with neutral H and He suggest-
ing a relative ion velocity of .300 km/s. While cross sections
obtained with the multichannel Landau-Zener method using
the so-called low-energy ℓ-distribution model predicts X-ray
line ratios consistent with the observations, calculations us-
ing the theoretical method known as the molecular-orbital
close-coupling approach, recognized to be among the most
complete treatments of ion-atom collisions at low-impact en-
ergies, but with signiﬁcantly greater computational eﬀort
and complexity, should be made to conﬁrm these results.

The MNRAS LATEX 2ε class ﬁle is implemented by placing the command

\documentclass[options]{mn2e}
at the start of the document.

The various option commands listed in the Monthly Notices LATEX style guide for authors can still be used. The following

additional options exist.

(i) useAMS – this enables the production of upright Greek characters π, µ and ∂ ($\upi$, $\umu$ and $\upartial$) and
slanted 6 and > ($\leq$ and $\geq$). Characters π, µ and ∂ appear upright only on systems that have the Euler roman
fonts (eurmxx ); characters 6 and > appear slanted only on systems that have the AMS series A fonts (msamxx ). On systems
that do not have these fonts, the standard forms of the characters appear in the printout; however, they should be correct in
the ﬁnal typeset paper if the correct LATEX commands have been used.

(ii) usedcolumn – this uses the package ﬁle dcolumn.sty to deﬁne two new types of column alignment for use in tables. If
the usedcolumn option has been speciﬁed then, within a table, d{x } can be used to produce a ‘ﬂush right’ decimal-aligned
column with x decimal places and . can be used to provide a decimal-aligned column centred on the decimal point (the
number of decimal places does not need to be speciﬁed for this column type). Note that the standard LATEX ‘tools’ packages
dcolumn.sty and array.sty are required in order to use the usedcolumn option.

(iii) usenatbib – this uses Patrick Daly’s natbib.sty package for cross-referencing. If the usenatbib option is speciﬁed,
citations in the text should be in one of the following forms (or one of the additional forms documented within natbib.sty
itself).

• \citet{key} produces text citations, e.g. Jones et al. (1990),
• \citep{key} produces citations in parentheses, e.g. (Jones et al. 1990),
• \citealt{key} produces citations with no parentheses, e.g. Jones et al. 1990.

For three-author papers, a full author list can be forced by putting a * just before the {. To add notes within the citation, use
the form \citep[pre reference text][post reference text]{key} (note that either of pre reference text and post reference text
can be blank).

Items in the reference list must be of the form

\bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{author names}{year }]{key} Text of reference ...
for one-, two- and multi-author papers, or
\bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{three author names}{ﬁrst author etal }{year }]{key} Text of reference ...
for three-author papers.

Note that Patrick Daly’s package natbib.sty is required in order to use the usenatbib option.
We recommend that authors use natbib.sty as their standard cross-referencing package, because of the ﬂexibility in citation

style that it provides.

(iv) usegraphicx – this loads the graphics package graphicx.sty, which authors can use to include ﬁgures in their papers.

Note that the standard LATEX graphics package graphicx.sty is required in order to use the usegraphicx option.

Other style ﬁles, or packages providing features such as graphics support, can be used in conjunction with mn.cls. To do

this, the command \usepackage{package name} is used.

An additional feature of the class ﬁle is that footnote symbols are now in the correct journal style (symbols for title page

footnotes, superscript arabic numbers for text footnotes).

A BibTeX style ﬁle, mn2e.bst, is now available for authors who wish to use BiBTeX. It is recommended that this should

be used in conjunction with natbib.sty.

authors, available on the CTAN sites in subdirectory /tex-archive/macros/latex209/mnras.
