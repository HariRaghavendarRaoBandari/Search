ABSTRACT

We report on the results of NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of the persistent X-ray source
1E1743.1-2843, located in the Galactic Center region. The source was observed between September
and October 2012 by NuSTAR and XMM-Newton, providing almost simultaneous observations in the
hard and soft X-ray bands. The high X-ray luminosity points to the presence of an accreting compact
object. We analyze the possibilities of this accreting compact object being either a neutron star (NS)
or a black hole, and conclude that the joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectrum from 0.3 to 40 keV
ﬁts to a black body spectrum with kT ∼ 1.8 keV emitted from a hot spot or an equatorial strip on
a neutron star surface. This spectrum is thermally Comptonized by electrons with kTe ∼ 4.6 keV.
Accepting this neutron star hypothesis, we probe the Low Mass (LMXB) or High Mass (HMXB)
X-ray Binary nature of the source. While the lack of Type-I bursts can be explained in the LMXB
scenario, the absence of pulsations in the 2 mHz - 49 Hz frequency range, the lack of eclipses and of
an IR companion, and the lack of a Kα line from neutral or moderately ionized iron strongly disfavor
interpreting this source as a HMXB. We therefore conclude that 1E1743.1-2843 is most likely a NS-
LMXB located beyond the Galactic Center. There is weak statistical evidence for a soft X-ray excess
possibly indicating thermal emission from an accretion disk. However, the disk normalization remains
unconstrained due to the high hydrogen column density (NH ∼ 1.6 × 1023 cm−2).

1. INTRODUCTION

The X-ray source 1E1743.1-2843 was discovered dur-
ing the ﬁrst soft X-ray imaging observation of the
Galactic Center, performed by the Einstein Observa-
tory (Watson et al. 1981), and has been detected in all
the subsequent observations performed by X-ray satel-
lites with imaging capabilities above 2 keV (Kawai et al.
1988; Sunyaev et al.
1994;
2009;

sition has been determined with Chandra to be

with a reported 0.21” 1 σ accuracy (Evans et al. 2010).
Because of its high column absorption (NH = 1.3 ±
0.1 × 1023 cm−2, see Cremonesi et al. 1999), the source
is likely in the Galactic Center (d = 7.9 ± 0.3 kpc,
McNamara et al. 2000) or beyond, while the orbital in-
clination is smaller than 70° (Cowley et al. 1983). The
analysis performed by Porquet et al. (2003) detected no
pulsations or quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) in the
2.4 mHz − 2.5 Hz frequency range using EPIC-MOS
and PN fullframe mode (time resolution 2.6 s and 200
ms, respectively). However, since many X-Ray Binaries
(XRB) present quasi-periodic variations above 2.5 Hz,
the XMM-Newton data were not suitable to probe the
millisecond pulsations that could indicate a Low Mass
X-ray Binary (LMXB) nature. In their analysis, Porquet
tested several single-component spectral models (i.e., ab-
sorbed power-law, absorbed black body, absorbed disk-
black body) but could not distinguish between these
models due to the narrow bandpass from 2 to 10 keV.
In this regard the NuSTAR capabilities to perform high
resolution broadband spectroscopy allow us to probe into
the nature of the high-energy emission from this source
more deeply.

The presence of an accreting object is required to ex-
plain the unabsorbed source luminosity, which is of the
order of L2−10 keV ∼ 1036 d2
10 kpc erg s−1, where d10 kpc
is the source distance expressed in units of 10 kpc, while
the absence of periodic oscillations and eclipses favors
a scenario in which a compact object (either a neutron
star or a black hole) accretes matter from a low mass

3 − 79 keV (Harrison et al. 2013). The mission carries
two identical telescopes with grazing incidence optics,
each one focusing on separate detector modules, Focal
Plane Modules A and B (FPMA, FPMB), at a distance
of 10 m. These CdZnTe detectors have a total Field of
View (FoV) of 13′ ×13′ (Harrison et al. 2013). The tele-
scope Point Spread Function (PSF) has an 18” FWHM
with extended tails resulting in a Half-Power-Diameter
of 58” (Harrison et al. 2013).

To improve the low-energy sampling of the source
spectrum we looked for other high-energy observations
of 1E1743.1-2843, performed approximately during the
same period. We adopted three XMM-Newton obser-
vations performed in imaging mode during September
2012, for a total exposure time of 90 ks. Observation
0694640401 however, is strongly contaminated by solar
emission, we therefore decided to not use it, reducing
the useful exposure time to 65 ks. The XMM-Newton
EPIC-pn camera provides data with nominal accuracy in
the 0.3 −10 keV energy band (XMM-Newton SOC team
2014), providing a good overlap with the NuSTAR data,
thereby minimizing possible bias in the spectral model-
ing.

The NuSTAR observations are not simultaneous with
XMM-Newton, but due to the small diﬀerence in time
(few weeks, see Table 1), and since 1E1743.1-2843
does not usually exhibit substantial spectral variability
(Cremonesi et al. 1999), we jointly ﬁt the two datasets
with a cross-normalization factor to account for any
ﬂux variation. During the observations the diﬀerence
of source ﬂuxes measured by the two instruments in the
overlapping energy band (3 − 10 keV) was below 1.3%,
indicating a good compatibility of the datasets.

the NuSTAR data

(obsID
40010005001) using
the NuSTAR Data Analysis
Software (NuSTARDAS) version 1.3.1 (9 December
2013), HEASOFT 6.15.1, and the most updated cali-
bration ﬁles and responses. The software applies oﬀset
correction factors to the energy response to account
for the movement of the mast that causes a varying
position of the focal spots on the detector planes. For
the data from each of the two modules, the pipeline
produces an image, spectrum and deadtime corrected
lightcurve. For each NuSTAR observation, the source
and background subtraction regions must be carefully
evaluated due to the possible presence of contaminating
sources outside the FoV that induce stray light patterns
on the detectors. Unfortunately the NuSTAR detectors
are not entirely shielded from unfocused X-rays, and
this stray light can be signiﬁcant if there are bright
X-ray sources within ∼ 2 − 3 degrees from the pointing
direction (Krivonos et al.
2014;
Mori et al. 2015). In this observation FPMB is highly
contaminated by two diﬀerent stray light patterns, as
can be seen in Figure 1, and furthermore the source
focal spot straddles the two diﬀerent patterns. Due to
the complexity of separating the source emission from
the stray light we decided to discard all the data from
FPMB.

companion (LMXB systems). LMXBs in this luminos-
ity range containing a neutron star are usually charac-
terized by thermonuclear ﬂashes of the accreted matter
that ignites on the neutron star surface (Type 1 X-ray
bursts), but these bursts have never been observed for
1E1743.1-2843 in 20 years of X-ray observations. This
has led so far to the conclusion that (1) the accretion
rate is high enough to allow stable burning of the ac-
˙M value com-
creted material, which would imply a
parable to the Eddington limit (Bildsten 2000), and
thus distance greater than 8 kpc, (2) the bursts are
suppressed by the presence of intense magnetic ﬁelds
(at least 109 G), (3) the accreting compact object is
a black hole (Porquet et al. 2003). The presence of
strong magnetic ﬁelds (> 1012 G), however, should be
accompanied by cyclotron absorption features and pul-
sations, neither of which have been observed in 1E1743.1-
2843. The source showed marginal variability on month
timescales in the 20 − 40 keV range (Del Santo et al.
2006), some variability on hour timescales (10-20%) in
the 1.3 − 10 keV energy range (Cremonesi et al. 1999),
and less than 18% of variability between 10−4 and 2.5 Hz
in the 2 − 10 keV energy range (Porquet et al. 2003).

We present here the results of four observations of
1E1743.1-2843 performed with the NuSTAR and XMM-
Newton satellites in September-October 2012. The two
satellites provided almost simultaneous broad-band X-
ray spectroscopy from 0.1 to 79 keV and, thanks to the
NuSTAR timing capabilities, we can also probe pulsa-
tions down to 2 milli-second timescales, providing un-
precedented opportunities to investigate this source. In
section 2 we describe the observations, in section 3 we
discuss the timing and spectral analysis. Our results and
discussion are presented in section 4.

2. OBSERVATIONS

All the observations were performed between Septem-
ber and October 2012. NuSTAR observed 1E1743.1-2843
during the a so-called “mini-survey” of the Galactic Cen-
ter, which took place shortly after the NuSTAR in-orbit
checkout. The observation was performed on October
15th 2012, and the total exposure time was 26 ks. The
source was ∼ 7′ oﬀ-axis in the NuSTAR observation and
appears distorted due to the asymmetric PSF shape at a
large oﬀ-axis angle (Madsen et al. 2015), as can be seen
in Figure 1.

NuSTAR is the ﬁrst X-ray satellite with multilayer
hard X-ray optics and is operational in the energy range

obtained by extracting photons in an elliptical region
of 95′′ × 46′′ semi axis, rotated by 35 degrees clockwise
relative to north and centered on the source centroid,
and subtracting count rate measured in a nearby circu-
lar background region of radius 114” (see Figure 1). The
diﬀerent area normalizations were taken into account in
the background subtraction. The dead layer thickness of
the two modules varies depending on the location on the
detector and, since the pipeline could fail to correct the
response matrix for this eﬀect to a suitable accuracy for
high oﬀ-axis angles, we decided to ignore the data below
5 keV. Also, due to imperfect background subtraction,
the data above 40 keV were ignored. All data bins were
grouped to reach at least 30 counts. The total source
count rate in this energy range is 2.10 ± 0.01 cts/s.

tion region. The red crosses indicate the source spectrum rebinned
to have at least 5σ signiﬁcance and 30 counts for each bin. The
blue line is the background spectrum.

3.2. XMM-Newton

We extracted the spectra of the EPIC-pn camera in
the 0.3 − 10 keV energy range following the standard
procedure described in the XMM-Newton software analy-
sis guide13 for the observations 0694640401, 0694640501,
and 0694641201, using the SAS software release xmm-
sas 20131209 1901-13.5.0. The lightcurves and spectra
of 1E1743.1-2843 were extracted from annular extraction
regions excluding zones where the number of counts ex-
ceeded 800 to avoid pileup if present (see Figure 3). The
lightcurves are shown in Figure 4.

EPIC-pn data below 0.3 keV are mostly re-

lated to artifacts and noise and were
(XMM-Newton SOC team 2014), and all the bins were
grouped to reach at least 30 counts. The mean count
rate for the two observations is 2.62 ± 0.01 cts/s.

3.3. Timing analysis

A lightcurve of the NuSTAR observation with 10 ms
time bin resolution was extracted for FPMA in the en-
ergy range 3–60 keV14 using nuproducts. Timing data
were corrected for deadtime and for arrival times at the
Solar System barycenter, using the JPL 2000 ephemeris
(Standish 1982) (for this purpose, we used the barycorr
tool in the HEASOFT 6.16 distribution). We then cal-
culated the power spectra on diﬀerent contiguous time
intervals and averaged them into a total spectrum. Each
single spectrum was built using intervals of 32768 bins,
and the total spectrum was built averaging 87 intervals
in a single frame. This was ﬁnally rebinned in frequency
channels for more statistics. An oﬀset constant term
was subtracted from the total spectrum to remove the
Poisson noise level and compensate for residual eﬀects
of the deadtime correction (this term was evaluated as
the average power in the frequency interval 10–49 Hz).
The resulting power spectrum is shown in Figure 5. The
statistics is too poor to model the power spectrum with a
multi-parameter function (such as a Lorentzian). Signal
is detected only up to frequencies of ∼ 0.1 Hz, with some
hint of complex structure, like the presence of a possible
break at frequencies > 0.02 Hz.

We also performed a Lomb-Scargle periodogram of
the same frequency interval as the power spectrum, and
found no signiﬁcant signal. The power spectrum and
Lomb period analysis were also performed for the two
XMM-Newton observations, also yielding no positive de-
tection of periodicities.

3.4. Spectral analysis

We analyzed the NuSTAR and the XMM-Newton
1996) version
datasets using XSPEC (Arnaud et al.
12.8.0, using the TBabs with abundances
set as
in Wilms et al. (2000) and cross sections set as in
Verner et al. (1996) to model the eﬀect of X-ray absorp-
tion. We performed the ﬁt allowing the normalizations
among the three diﬀerent observations to vary. These
normalizations relative to the diﬀerent XMM-Newton
datasets remained constant for every model, and were
found to be C1 = 0.99 ± 0.01, C2 = 1.00 ± 0.01 for ob-
servations 0694641201 and 0694640501, respectively.

We used the following four models to ﬁgure out the
nature of the source, the ﬁrst three of which were used
to test the origin of the low-energy emission:

while the pileup threshold was not exceeded in the leftmost one (thus no inner ellipse was plotted on the image).

• Model 2:

a disk black body (diskbb) plus a
power-law × highEcut. This is also a typical
single-component spectral model, but assumes the
compact source is a black hole binary.

• Model 3: a disk black body (diskbb), a black body
(bbodyrad), and the power-law × highEcut.
This model probes deeper into the neutron star
hypothesis, adding an accretion disk component to
model 1.

• Model 4: a disk black body (diskbb), a black
body (bbodyrad), and the compTT Comptonization
model. In this model the powerlaw in model 3 is
replaced by a more physical model.

To model the emission from the accretion disk we used
the multi-color disk black body diskbb model mentioned
before (Mitsuda et al. 1984; Makishima et al. 1986).

The ﬁt results shown in Table 2 indicate that the source
emission is mainly contributed by a prominent blackbody
component at ∼ 2 keV plus a high energy continuum
which can be described equally well by an empirical law
(power-law × highEcut) or by a thermal Comptoniza-
tion (compTT) component. As can be seen from Table 2
all the models provide a good ﬁt of the data.
In the
following we will assume as baseline model 3, since it
provides the lowest χ2 value, and a reasonable physical
interpretation of the data, as discussed in section 4.

Adding another absorption component with partial
covering (pcfabs) to model 1 did not improve the ﬁt
results, therefore we conclude that the source is not par-
tially obscured. Also, the spectroscopic data do not
need the addition of further high energy components such
as, for instance, reﬂection, as we veriﬁed by adding the
coplrefl (Ballantyne et al. 2012) reﬂection component

to model 3.

We then addressed the high-energy component taking
as a baseline model 3 and replacing the power-law plus
cutoﬀ component with a more physical model, specif-
ically compTT (Titarchuk et al. 1994), which describes
the Comptonization of soft photons in a thermal plasma
of high-energy electrons above the accreting source. In
the resulting model 4 the compTT component gives a
worse ﬁt than the power-law with an exponential cut-
oﬀ (model 3). However, model 4 still yields a better ﬁt
than models 1 and 2, and has the advantage of allowing
a more physical interpretation of the source spectrum
than the empirical model 3. Furthermore, we tested if a
single thermal component and a Comptonized one could
ﬁt the data, and replaced the power-law in model 1 with
the compTT model. However this resulted in a worse ﬁt
(χ2
∼ 1.07). Finally, if we test model 4 for the pres-
ence of the ﬂuorescence line of neutral iron, χ2
red rises to
1.2. Therefore the presence of the iron Kα line is also
not required. From model 4 we derive an upper limit on
the iron Kα equivalent width (EW) of 4.9 eV.

red

Summarizing, model 3 and model 4 give the best re-
sults. Model 3 has the lower reduced χ2 value among the
two, though the compTT model allows the determination
of the physical parameters of the source. The resulting
spectra for model 4 are shown in Figure 3.4, and the
results of the overall ﬁts in are reported in Table 2.

4. DISCUSSION

In this work we have reported on a broad band
(0.3 − 40 keV) spectral analysis of 1E1743.1-2843, ob-
served with NuSTAR and XMM-Newton. A similar
analysis had previously been performed using INTE-
GRAL data (Del Santo et al. 2006), but the improved
energy resolution and sensitivity of NuSTAR allows us
to better constrain the hard X-ray continuum, identify-
ing the presence of Comptonization and of a cutoﬀ in
the high-energy emission for the ﬁrst time. This allowed
to use more sophisticated models compared to previ-
ous works (Del Santo et al. 2006; Porquet et al. 2003;
Cremonesi et al. 1999). Below we summarize the re-
sults obtained and discuss the ones that support either

the LMXB or HMXB nature of the system.

Regarding the low-energy emission of the source, the
presence of the kT=1.8 keV black body is a strong in-
dication of a neutron star nature of the compact object.
The black body radius is ∼ 1 km if we assume the source
to be located in the Galactic Center, at d ∼ 8.8 kpc.
This is not compatible with emission from a boundary
layer near the neutron star surface (RBL − RN S ∼ 2 km
for low ˙M, Popham & Sunyaev 2001), but is consistent
with emission from a restricted region of the neutron
star surface (i.e., from an equatorial belt in the orbital
plane, or with magnetically driven accretion onto polar
caps). In the latter case the magnetic ﬁeld strength of the
compact source should be > 109 G. There is possibly a
soft excess which could be interpreted as weak emission
from an accretion disk (kT ∼ 0.1 keV). However, the
XMM-Newton data were unable to constrain the black
body normalization due to the high hydrogen column
absorption (NH ∼ 1.6 × 1023 cm−2).
In the HMXB
scenario this soft excess could also be interpreted as a
blend of emission lines, as thermal emission from the neu-
tron star surface, or Thomson scattering of the hot spot
emission by the accreting material (van der Meer et al.
2004). The reliability of the soft excess detection is worth
discussing, because the χ2 improvement it provides is
moderate. The use of the F-test could result in unreli-
able results (Protassov et al. 2002), so we performed a
series of Monte Carlo simulations with the simftest rou-
tine to conﬁrm the presence of such component, following
the approach described by Bhalerao et al.
(2015). The
highest ∆χ2 obtained in 10000 simulations is 18.7, sig-
niﬁcantly lower than ∆χ2 = 43.2 obtained by the real
data (see Figure 7). We estimate that > 109 simulations
would be required to get ∆χ2 > 40, corresponding to
a signiﬁcance higher than 6σ. Nevertheless, even if the
presence of the soft excess is statistically preferred, we
cannot exclude that the low energy spectrum is aﬀected
by systematics, which could arise, e.g., in adding two ex-
posures taken at diﬀerent epochs. We regard this as a
result that needs to be conﬁrmed by better quality low
energy data from future observations of this source.

The presence of a neutral iron Kα line at 6.4 keV is
not statistically required, with an upper limit on the
EW of 4.9 eV from model 4 (6.7 eV from model 3).
This value is compatible with the expected properties
of LMXB (Asai et al. 2000) and radio-quiet quasars
(George et al. 2000), as already pointed out by Por-
quet et al. (2003). This weakens the HMXB hypothesis
for this source, since the iron line is usually detected in
such systems. On the other hand, lack of the Fe Kα
line in LMXBs is very common, and is usually asso-
ciated with the Baldwin eﬀect: the high luminosity of
the X-ray source increases the degree of iron ionization
(Torrejon et al. 2010).

The high-energy emission is characterized by a power-
law (Γ ∼ 1.3) with a high-energy cutoﬀ (Ecut ∼ 7.2 keV),
identiﬁed for the ﬁrst time thanks to the NuSTAR hard
X-Ray sensitivity. The NuSTAR data also unambigu-
ously identiﬁed the presence of a Comptonization com-
ponent,
induced by an electron population with tem-

if X-rays are produced near the neutron star at ener-
gies of several tens of keV, the observed X-rays will
be shifted to lower energy due to Comptonization by
the more distant low-energy plasma with a tempera-
ture several keV. This Comptonization component has
a strong interplay with the 1.8 keV black body up to
∼ 20 keV, since the total hard X-ray spectrum cannot
be described as a single power-law. We tested for the
presence of a reﬂection component, and found that it is
not required to explain the data. A ﬁt with a power-
law model without breaks brought higher values of the

photon index (Γ = 2.3+0.08

ous results (Del Santo et al. 2006; Porquet et al. 2003;

for X-ray bursters (Cremonesi et al.
1999; Bildsten
2000). To investigate further, we have extracted the
Ks-band image of the Vista survey “VISTA Variables in
the Via Lactea (VVV)” (Minniti et al. 2010) (see Fig-
ure 4). Both the XMM-Newton and Chandra positions
of 1E1743.1-2843 are visible in the image, as well as the
position of the source UGPS J174621.12284343.3 as re-
ported in the UKIDSS catalogue (Lawrence et al. 2007).
The nominal accuracy of UKIDSS is ∼ 0.1 arcsec, but to
account for source confusion in this crowded region we
used a larger 0.3 arcsec positional error, as suggested
(2008). We should consider whether
by Lucas et al.
this source might be the counterpart.
In the UKIDSS
catalog, this source does not have a K-band magnitude
listed, but it has H = 16.82 ± 0.09 and J = 18.39 ± 0.08.
Assuming the 0.21′′ uncertainty on the Chandra posi-
tion (Evans et al. 2010), then this source is excluded,
as can be seen in the ﬁgure. Also, given the extreme
IR source crowding in the GC, the fraction of true-to-
candidate counterparts for hard Chandra sources is very
low (see, for instance De Witt et al. 2010). Further-
more, since the NuSTAR/XMM-Newton column densi-
ties are consistent with the overall Galactic Center value,
it not likely that the companion star is hidden by a cloud
either. However, we cannot exclude a high mass com-
panion solely on the basis of the absence of a bright IR
source. In fact, a B-type star placed at the distance of 8.5
kpc could have IR magnitudes fainter than the limiting
H-band magnitude of the vista surveys of the Galactic
Center (McMahon et al. 2013), assuming an IR absorp-
tion corresponding to the hydrogen column density we
measured for 1E1743.1-2843 (see Table 2).

In the LMXB hypothesis the fact that not a single
burst has been observed in over 20 years suggests that
the source is a rare burster (in ’t Zand et al. 2004). In
principle, the lack of bursts could be explained if the
source is located outside the Galaxy. Speciﬁcally, to
reach L = 2.9 × 1037 erg s−1, corresponding to the stable

burning of accreted material, 1E1743.1-2843 would need
to be placed at d ∼ 40 kpc. However, a study of the
stability conditions for accreting objects (Narayan et al.
2002) indicates that, for a neutron star with a surface
temperature of∼ 2 keV, there is a luminosity range
where stable accretion is possible, between the instabil-
ity regions where He and H bursts are triggered. This
“stability strip” corresponds roughly15 to luminosities
1.3 × 1036 < L < 6.5 × 1036 erg s−1. This implies that
if the source is located between the Galactic Center and
∼ 16 kpc the lack of bursts is to be expected, as well as
the lack of the detection of an IR companion.

Church et al.

(2014) recently proposed a uniﬁed
model for the LMXB sources. The model assumes the
presence of an extended accretion disk corona (ADC).
For L > 1 − 2 × 1037 erg s−1 the ADC is in thermal
equilibrium with the neutron star surface, giving rise to
a Comptonized spectrum with Ecut ∼ 6 keV, which
corresponds roughly to three times the actual tempera-
ture of the electrons (in the assumption of high optical
depth). For lower luminosities, the Comptonization be-
comes ineﬃcient in cooling the corona, the thermal equi-
librium assumption breaks down and, as a consequence,
the extended ADC heats up to several tens of keV. In
this scenario the ∼ 1 km black body radii in LMXBs
are explained by an emitting region in the shape of an
equatorial strip in the orbital plane with a half height
h ∼ 100 m. This scenario is described by a black body
plus a cutoﬀ power-law (our model 1). The authors also
note that compTT is not consistent with the evidence
for an extended corona. The outer regions of the ac-
cretion disk (kT ∼ 0.1 keV), which provide the seed
photons for the Compton scattering, are not expected
to be detected. Our results for the black body temper-
ature (kT ∼ 1.8 keV) and radius (r ∼ 1 km), for the
Ecut ∼ 3kTe− ∼ 6.6 keV of the Comptonized com-
ponent, and for the ratio of total to black body lumi-
nosity for 1E1743.1-2843 ﬁt within the expected ranges

Lotti et al.

for the scenario they depict as the Banana state of
the Atoll sources. This interpretation, however, implies
L > 2 × 1037 erg s−1 to explain the spectral cutoﬀ value
and the lack of bursting activity. This would require a
distance of a few tens of kpc to account for the observed
ﬂux, which could be explained if 1E1743.1-2843 were in
the Sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy (SAGDEG), one of
the small dwarf spheroidal galaxies that orbits the Milky
Way. SAGDEG is currently behind the GC at distance
d ∼ 26 kpc (Cole et al. 2009), and is in an advanced
state of destruction due to tidal interactions with the
Galaxy. Therefore a fraction of the stars that composed
this dwarf galaxy have likely scattered to even greater
distances.

In the HMXB scenario, the presence of a strong
magnetic ﬁeld (B ∼ 1012−13 G) suppresses the prop-
agation of the bursts across the neutron star surface
(Gilfanov et al. 2014). However the lack of eclipses, Fe
Kα line, and pulsations in the light curve, as well as
the missing detection of a companion star, makes the
HMXB hypothesis less favored, even though the value of
the spectral cutoﬀ (9 ± 1.8 keV) is compatible with the
one expected from HMXBs (10 − 20 keV).

We conclude that while an HMXB framework leaves
several unexplained features, interpreting 1E1743.1-2843
as a NS-LMXB scenario is more consistent, implying a
peculiar but not a unique object. In this case the source
could be located at a distance 9 < d < 16 kpc, between
the two instability luminosity intervals where He and H
bursts are triggered or, if we rely on the uniﬁed model
proposed by Church et al.
(2014), at a distance d >
36 kpc, corresponding to the stable burning of accreted
material.
