A NOTE ON SMOOTHING PROPERTIES OF THE BERGMAN

PROJECTION

SIVAGURU RAVISANKAR AND YUNUS E. ZEYTUNCU

Abstract. Recently Herbig, McNeal, and Straube have showed that the Bergman pro-
jection of conjugate holomorphic functions is smooth up to the boundary on a class of
pseudoconvex domains. We show that a further smoothing property holds on a family of
Reinhardt domains; namely, the Bergman projection of conjugate holomorphic functions is
holomorphic past the boundary.

1. Introduction

Let Ω be a bounded domain in Cn. The Bergman projection BΩ is the orthogonal projec-
tion operator from the space of square integrable functions L2(Ω) onto the closed subspace
of square integrable holomorphic functions A2(Ω). The boundedness of BΩ on other function
spaces is of considerable interest and it has deep connections with the geometry of the do-
main. For example, if Ω is strongly pseudoconvex then the projection operator is bounded
on all Lp-Sobolev spaces W p,k(Ω) for all p ∈ (1, ∞) and k ≥ 0 [PS77]. On the other hand,
if the operator BΩ is bounded on all L2-Sobolev spaces W k(Ω) for k ≥ 0 then any biholo-
moprhic map from a smooth Ω to another smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domain extends
smoothly to the closure of domains [Bel81].

The Bergman projection preserves holomorphic functions and hence the holomorphic
Sobolev space at each scale. Therefore, one can not expect any gain in the Sobolev scale
under BΩ. However, in two recent papers [HM12] and [HMS14] the authors have shown that
BΩ gains derivatives in certain directions on a class of bounded pseudoconvex domains. Out
of a few diﬀerent formulations of this gain, we highlight the following version. A domain Ω
satisﬁes condition R if BΩ maps the space of functions smooth up to the boundary C ∞(Ω)
to itself.

Theorem. [HMS14, Corollary 1.12] Let Ω be a smoothly bounded domain in Cn and assume
that the condition R holds on Ω. Then for any f ∈ A2(Ω), BΩ ¯f is smooth up to the boundary.

We note that even when the function f does not belong to any Sobolev space W k(Ω)
for k > 0, the projection BΩ ¯f automatically lands in all W k(Ω). In other words, on such
domains the Bergman projection BΩ smoothens conjugate holomorphic functions.

Moreover, the following observation on complete Reinhardt domains suggests a further
smoothing may hold. On such a domain Ω, BΩ ¯f is a constant for f ∈ A2(Ω). This follows
from {zα/cα} forming an orthonormal basis for A2(Ω). Consequently, not only is BΩ ¯f smooth

up to the boundary, it is, in fact, holomorphic on a larger domain (actually holomorphic on
Cn). This example suggests that BΩ may have a further smoothing property and we indeed
prove such a result on a family of Reinhardt domains.

Theorem 1.1. Let Ω ⊂ Cn be a bounded Reinhardt domain such that Ω does not intersect
the coordinate axes. Then, for every f ∈ A2(Ω), BΩ ¯f extends holomorphically to a (strictly)
larger log-convex Reinhardt domain.

In contrast to the result of Herbig, McNeal, and Straube, the above theorem describes a
new phenomenon on a diﬀerent class of domains. Even on smooth Reinhardt domains which
satisfy condition R (see [Boa84, Str86]), our result draws a stronger conclusion. Note that
on any smooth bounded domain there exists a holomorphic function that is smooth up to
the boundary and does not extend past any boundary point [Cat80]. Furthermore, it is not
known whether condition R holds on the domains we consider without smoothness of the
boundary.

Our main tool in proving this result is observing it in the special case of a product of
annuli in Cn. We show this in Proposition 3.1 and this can be rephrased as the following
local smoothing property. Once we prove the local statement, the global version follows from
a patching argument.

Theorem 1.2. Let Ω ⊂ Cn be a Reinhardt domain and P ⊂ Ω be a product of annuli such
that P does not intersect the coordinate axes. Then, for every f ∈ A2(Ω), BΩ ¯f extends
holomorphically past bP ∩ bΩ.

In the next section, we go over some basic facts about the Bergman projection and some
examples that lead into the main theorem. We prove the main statements in Section 3. We
conclude with some further remarks in the last section.

2. Setup and Examples

2A. Basic Setup. In this section, we focus on bounded Reinhardt domains. Let Ω be a
bounded Reinhardt domain in Cn; that is, if z ∈ Ω and |t| = 1 then tz ∈ Ω. We denote the
Hilbert space of square integrable functions with respect to the Lebesgue measure dV by
L2(Ω). The subspace of holomorphic functions in L2(Ω) is called the Bergman space and it
is denoted by A2(Ω). It follows from the mean value property of holomorphic functions that
A2(Ω) is a closed subspace of L2(Ω). Hence, there exists an orthogonal projection operator
from L2(Ω) onto A2(Ω) and it is called the Bergman projection BΩ.

The set (or a subset) of monomials {zα : α ∈ Zn} forms an orthogonal basis for A2(Ω).

Let c2
space. It turns out that A2(Ω) is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and we have the following
representation for the Bergman kernel by using this orthonormal basis,

α =RΩ |zα|2dV (z). Then, the set {zα/cα} forms an orthonormal basis for the Bergman

and the Bergman projection is the integral operator associated to this kernel,

BΩ(z, w) = Xα∈Zn

Originally deﬁned only on L2(Ω), it is known that BΩ is a bounded operator on other
function spaces under various geometric conditions. We refer to [BS99] for a survey of
results on Sobolev spaces and to [MS94, Zey13] and the references therein for a sample of
results on Lp spaces.

2B. Examples. We begin by studying a motivating example - an annulus in C. An ele-
mentary calculation yields that the Bergman projection of a conjugate holomorphic function
in L2 extends holomorphically to a larger domain. For 0 ≤ r < R, let A(r, R) denote the
annulus {r < |z| < R}.

Lemma 2.1. Let f ∈ A2 (A(r, 1)) for 0 < r < 1. Then, BA(r,1)

¯f is holomorphic extends

Proof. For j ∈ Z, let cj = kzjkL2(A(r,1)) so that {zj/cj} is an orthonormal basis for A2(A(r, 1)).

Let us use the Laurent expansion f =Pj fjzj of f ∈ A2(A(r, 1)) to compute BA(r,1) ¯f .

The conclusion follows by noting that the middle term converges (uniformly absolutely on

A simple scaling argument gives us the following generalization.

If we consider an annulus with inner radius 0, that is, the punctured disc, we are in a rather
simple situation where the Bergman projection of an L2 conjugate holomorphic function is
a constant; in particular, an entire function.

Example 2.3. Consider the punctured disc D \ {0} ⊂ C and let f ∈ A2(D \ {0}). Since f
has a removable singularity at 0 it extends to a function in A2(D) which we denote by f as
well. In particular, A2(D \ {0}) and A2(D) are spanned by {zj : j ≥ 0}. Since, the L2 norms
on D and D \ {0} agree, the Bergman projections on D \ {0} and D agree and we have

a constant.

The following example of the Hartogs’ triangle, in which the origin is in the closure of the
domain, however, presents a much subtler picture. The global version of the main theorem
fails to hold whereas the local version holds everywhere except at the origin. This highlights
the importance of the assumption that Ω not intersect the coordinate axes in Theorem 1.1.

Example 2.4 (Hartogs’ Triangle). Consider the Hartogs’ Triangle Ω = {|z| < |w| < 1} ⊂
C2. Then, A2(Ω) is spanned by {zjwk : j ≥ 0, j + k + 1 ≥ 0}. Furthermore, note that for
j, α ≥ 0, j + k + 1 ≥ 0, and α + β + 1 ≥ 0,

Notice that there is a larger domain Ω′ to which the functions BΩ ¯f extend holomorphically

but Ω 6⊂ Ω′.

By considering the fat Hartogs’ Triangle Ω = {|z|γ < |w| < 1}, for γ > 0, we can arrange

BΩ ¯f to have (up to) any prescribed ﬁnite order of blow-up at 0.

3. Main Theorem and its Proof

We begin with a proposition that proves the main theorem for a product of annuli. We
will use this result to prove the local version of the main theorem which in turn is used to
prove the main theorem.

Proposition 3.1. Let P ⊂ Cn be a product of annuli such that P does not intersect the
coordinate axes.

Then, there exists a product of annuli P ′ ⊂ Cn such that
(i) P ⊂ P ′,

(ii) P ′ does not intersect the coordinate axes, and
(iii) for every f ∈ A2(P ), BP ¯f ∈ A2(P ′). i.e., there exists F ∈ A2(P ′) such that F |P = BP ¯f .

Proof. Let P ′ ⊂ Cn be any product of annuli such that P ⊂ P ′ and P ′ does not intersect
the coordinate axes. We will place further restrictions on P ′ to ensure that it satisﬁes the
other conclusions in the statement.

For α ∈ Zn, let cα = kzαkL2(P ) and dα = kzαkL2(P ′) so that {zα/cα} and {zα/dα} are

orthonormal bases for A2(P ) and A2(P ′) respectively. Let f =Pα fα

That is, we need to ﬁnd P ′ so that the following holds:

L2(P ) < ∞, it suﬃces to choose P ′ so that dα ≤ c−αc2

α for all α ∈ Zn.

for all α ∈ Zn and some C > 0 which is independent of α.

Since P and P ′ are products of annuli, we will be done if we show the following: given an
annulus A ⊂ C there exists an annulus A′ ⊂ C such that A ⊂ A′, 0 /∈ A′, and the pair A
and A′ satisfy the above inequality. Suppose A = A(r, R) for some 0 < r < R. Then, one
can check that A′ = A(r′, R′) satisﬁes the above criteria for any r′ and R′ satisfying

r2
R

< r′ < R′ <

R2
r

.

This is in agreement with the conclusion of Corollary 2.2 which guaranteed holomorphic
extension of BA ¯f , for f ∈ A2(A), to A(r2/R, R2/r) from which it follows that the extension
is L2 in any compact subset of A(r2/R, R2/r). i.e., BA ¯f ∈ A2(A(r′, R′)).
(cid:3)

Note that the closure of P not intersecting the coordinate axes was crucial in the above
proof. This was highlighted earlier in Example 2.4 as well. Let us now proceed to prove the
local version of the main theorem.

Theorem 3.3 (Local Version). Let Ω ⊂ Cn be a Reinhardt domain and P ⊂ Ω be a product
of annuli such that P does not intersect the coordinate axes.

Then, for every f ∈ A2(Ω), BΩ
More precisely, there exists a product of annuli P ′ such that
(i) P ⊂ P ′, and hence bP ∩ bΩ ⊂ P ′,

¯f extends holomorphically past bP ∩ bΩ.

(ii) P ′ does not intersect the coordinate axes, and
(iii) for every f ∈ A2(Ω), BΩ ¯f ∈ A2(P ′).

i.e., there exists F ∈ A2(P ′) such that F |P =

BΩ ¯f(cid:12)(cid:12)P .

Proof. Write f ∈ A2(Ω) as f = Pα fαzα with fα = 0 when zα /∈ A2(Ω). For α ∈ Zn, let

cα = kzαkL2(Ω) and dα = kzαkL2(P ) noting that some of the cα’s might be inﬁnite. Hence,

By Proposition 3.1 there exists a larger product of annuli P ′ such that P ⊂ P ′ and BP ¯f ∈
A2(P ′). If we let eα = kzαkL2(P ′) for α ∈ Zn, we have,

More precisely, there exists a log-convex Reinhardt domain Ω′ ⊂ Cn such that
(i) Ω ⊂ Ω′, and

(ii) for every f ∈ A2(Ω), BΩ ¯f extends holomorphically to Ω′.

Proof. We apply the local version of the main theorem at each boundary point and show
that this gives us the result. For every z ∈ bΩ, let Pz be a product of annuli satisfying the
following properties: Pz ⊂ Ω, z ∈ bPz, and Pz does not intersect the coordinate axes. Note
that this can be done since Ω is a Reinhardt domain whose closure does not intersect the
coordinate axes. By Theorem 3.3, there exists P ′

Since {P ′

covers bΩ. In fact, this sub-collection covers a full neighbourhood of bΩ. Now, let

Clearly Ω ⊂ Ω′ and Ω′ is a Reinhardt domain. For f ∈ A2(Ω), BΩ

as noted earlier and BΩ ¯f ∈ A2(Ω) by deﬁnition. Hence, BΩ ¯f ∈ A2(Ω′) and, in particular, it
is holomorphic in Ω′.

¯f ∈ A2(P ′

Recall that a Reinhardt domain is pseudoconvex if and only if it is log-convex. If Ω′ is not
pseudoconvex, all holomorphic functions on Ω′ extend holomorphically to its pseudoconvex
hull. Hence, we may replace Ω′ by its pseudoconvex hull which is the smallest log-convex
Reinhardt domain containing it.
(cid:3)

4. Concluding Remarks

In light of the results presented here, it is natural to ask whether holomorphic extension

(at least for conjugate holomorphic functions) holds on other classes of domains.

Recently, in [CDM15] it is shown that the smoothing property observed in [HM12, HMS14]
also holds for weighted Bergman projections. A direct adaptation of our arguments here
would show that the same holomorphic extension also holds for weighted Bergman projec-
tions with multi-radial weights.

A version of the smoothing property shown in [HM12] also holds for the harmonic Bergman
projection [Her13]. Analogously, one can investigate harmonic extension phenomena enjoyed
by the harmonic Bergman projection on domains with certain symmetries.
