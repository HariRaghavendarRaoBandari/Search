We reinvestigate the putative giant spin splitting at the surface of SrTiO3 reported by Santander-
Syro et al. [Nature Mat. 13, 1085 (2014)]. Our spin- and angle-resolved photoemission experiments
on (001) oriented surfaces supporting a two-dimensional electron liquid with high carrier density
show no detectable spin polarization in the photocurrent. We demonstrate that this result excludes
a giant spin splitting while it is fully consistent with the unconventional Rashba-like splitting seen in
band structure calculations that reproduce the experimentally observed ladder of quantum conﬁned
subbands.

Two-dimensional electron liquids (2DELs) formed at
the interfaces between insulating transition metal ox-
ides are important for the rapidly growing ﬁeld of ox-
ide electronics. Their potential utility lies in their ex-
otic responses to external ﬁelds which, for the proto-
typical case of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) inter-
face, includes gate-tunable superconductivity1,2 possibly
coexisting with magnetism3, and gate-tunable Rashba
interaction4–6.
It has been shown that STO can sup-
port such a two-dimensional electron liquid in many other
conﬁgurations, for example when interfaced with amor-
phous LAO7, by electrolyte gating8 or by reduction of
the bare surface by UV radiation9,10 or Al capping11. Ir-
respective of their origin, all these systems show a similar
electronic structure with multiple subbands and a char-
acteristic orbital polarization, commonly understood as a
consequence of quantum conﬁnement of the Ti t2g states
in a potential well induced by band bending9,10,12–17.

Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) of both
interface and surface geometries predicts an unconven-
tional Rashba-like spin splitting of these quantum con-
ﬁned subbands due to broken inversion symmetry and
the interplay of orbital and spin degrees of freedom. The
lifting of spin degeneracy is found to be of the order
of ∼ 1 meV at the Fermi surface except in the vicinity
of avoided crossings of subbands with diﬀerent orbital
character where it can be enhanced by almost an order
of magnitude15,18–23. The resulting k-space spin texture
is complex and has not yet been observed experimentally.
However, the magnitude and carrier density dependence
of the Rashba splitting inferred from transport and quan-
tum oscillation experiments4,5,24,25 is in good agreement
with these calculations.

Recently, a completely diﬀerent interpretation of the

basic electronic structure of the 2DEL at the (001) sur-
face of STO has been proposed by Santander-Syro et
al.
to explain a large spin polarization signal in their
spin- and angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(SARPES) measurements26. The authors of Ref. 26 pro-
pose that the ﬁrst two light subbands of the STO 2DEL
(SB1, SB2 in Fig. 1) arise from a single band with a giant
Rashba splitting of approximately 100 meV at the chem-
ical potential. In order to reconcile this claim with the
large subband splitting at the Γ point that is well estab-
lished from high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (HR-ARPES)9–11,13,15, Santander-Syro et
al. propose the existence of strong ferromagnetism with
signiﬁcant out-of-plane moments. To date, a Rashba
splitting of this magnitude has not been reproduced ex-
perimentally or explained theoretically22,23,27. More-
over, a giant Rashba splitting is inconsistent with trans-
port measurements of both surface24,28 and interface4,5
2DELs in STO. It is also far greater than experimen-
tally observed spin-splittings in other systems with bro-
ken inversion symmetry whose constituent atoms, like
STO, have relatively low atomic numbers leading to weak
atomic spin-orbit interaction29,30.

Here we present low temperature SARPES meaure-
ments on fractured STO that show a negligible spin po-
larization of the photocurrent. We demonstrate that
this result is fully consistent with band structure calcula-
tions that reproduce the experimentally observed ladder
of subbands as well as the Rashba splitting deduced from
transport experiments, while it is inconsistent with the
giant spin-splitting reported by Santander-Syro et al.26.

ual bulk conductivity which helps to eliminate charging
eﬀects during ARPES measurements but does not other-
wise inﬂuence our results. Data were taken using photon
energies in the range 45 – 100 eV. HR-ARPES measure-
ments were performed at a temperature of 10 K with a
Scienta R4000 hemispherical analyser at the I05 beam-
line of the Diamond Light Source with angular resolu-
tion < 0.3◦ and energy resolution < 15 meV and pres-
sures < 1 × 10−10 mbar. SARPES experiments were per-
formed at a temperature of 20 K at pressures < 1×10−10
mbar, using polarized undulator radiation at the UE112-
PGM1 beamline of BESSY II. Spin analysis of the pho-
toelectrons was provided by a Rice University Mott-type
spin polarimeter31 operated at 26 kV and coupled to a
SPECS Phoibos 150 hemispherical analyzer. The energy
resolution of the SARPES experiment was ∼100 meV,
the angular resolution ∼0.8◦, and the Shermann func-
tion Seﬀ = 0.16. Samples were fractured in situ at the
measurement temperature and pressure.

We ﬁrst demonstrate that our HR-ARPES data is fully
consistent with a subband structure resulting from quan-
tum conﬁnement of the STO conduction band and the
ensuing unconventional Rashba spin splitting predicted
by several authors15,18–23. Fig. 1 (a) shows the energy-
momentum dispersion of the (001) STO surface 2DEL
measured with spin-integrated HR-ARPES. Three bands
with a light band mass and a fourth with a compar-
atively heavy band mass can be identiﬁed. The light
bands have dxy orbital character and are more spatially
conﬁned than the heavy band of dxz/yz orbital charac-
ter15. The ordering and conﬁnement energies of these
subbands are in good agreement with the band struc-
ture calculation following the approach of Refs. 15 and
32 that is overlaid on the right hand side of Fig. 1(a).
This calculation is the self-consistent solution of coupled
Poisson-Schr¨odinger equations with a tight-binding su-
percell Hamiltonian obtained from transfer integrals gen-
erated by downfolding ab initio DFT wave functions

onto maximally localized Wannier functions. A band
bending potential has been included as an on-site po-
tential term. The electrostatic boundary conditions are
chosen to conserve bulk charge neutrality and reproduce
the total experimental bandwidth of ≈ 250 meV. We in-
clude an electric ﬁeld dependent dielectric constant of the
form suggested in Ref. 33. Further details of the calcula-
tion can be found elsewhere15,32.

A small Rashba-like spin splitting is apparent through-
out the calculated subband structure. The spin expecta-
tion value (cid:104)Sy(cid:105) of each eigenstate is represented by the
red-white-blue color scale in Fig. 1(b) and corresponds to
spins locked perpendicular to the momentum. This is the
characteristic signature of the Rashba interaction result-
ing from broken inversion symmetry, which in this case
arises from the band bending potential at the surface.
However, it is evident from Fig. 1 (c) that the spin split-
ting deviates from a conventional Rashba picture near
avoided crossings of light and heavy bands. In these lim-
ited regions of k-space the wave functions are linear com-
binations of the t2g crystal ﬁeld eigenstates. Hence, their
orbital angular momentum L is no longer fully quenched
leading to a sizable spin-orbit coupling L · S and thus an
enhanced spin splitting15. A more detailed comparison to
the data shown in Fig. 1(c) highlights that the predicted
spin spitting, even at the avoided crossings where it can
be as large at 7 meV, would be obscured by resolution
and lifetime broadening in HR-ARPES, and as such is
consistent with the experimentally determined subband
structure.

While the good agreement between our band structure
calculations and spin-integrated HR-ARPES data is hard
to reconcile with a giant Rashba splitting as reported by
Ref. 26, it does not fully exclude it. Therefore, to rein-
vestigate this discrepancy, we performed new SARPES
measurements on fractured surfaces of (001) orientated
La doped STO, as were used in Fig. 1. To characterize
the sample surface prior to the spin-resolved measure-

ments, we acquired the spin-integrated dispersion shown
in Fig. 2(b), which conﬁrms the presence of a 2DEL.
The lower data quality as compared to Fig. 1 can be at-
tributed to resolution eﬀects. To demonstrate this we
show in Fig. 2 (c) a two-dimensional convolution of the
HR-ARPES measurement in Fig. 1(a) with a Gaussian,
representing the energy and momentum resolution of our
SARPES measurements. Comparison of Fig. 2(b) and
Fig. 2(c) conﬁrms that the states have similar carrier
density. The slight diﬀerences in spectral weight distri-
bution between Fig. 2 (b) and (c) can be attributed to
the photon energy dependence of matrix elements, which
increases the contribution of the shallow heavy subband
in Fig. 2 (b).

Our SARPES measurements are sensitive to the two
components of the spin polarization vector in the Mott
scattering plane. In the sample reference frame these cor-
respond to the y component of the spin polarization vec-
tor that lies entirely in the surface plane and is perpen-
dicular to the electron momentum kx, and a combination
of the x-component and out-of-plane z-component. The

evident from this data that all components of the spin-
polarization measured at diﬀerent photon energies and
polarizations are below the noise level. In particular, we
do not see any signatures of a Rashba-like spin-splitting,
which would be expected in the y channel within ≈ 0.3 eV
of the Fermi level for the STO surface 2DEL. The upper
limit on polarization features that may be obscured by
noise in our measurements is ∼ 0.05, which is far smaller
than the spin-polarization reported in Ref. 26. As we
will show in the following, our measurements rule out
a giant Rashba splitting, while they are fully consistent
with the much smaller, unconventional Rashba splitting
found consistently in our band structure calculations and
by several other authors15,18–23.

In order to facilitate the discussion of our SARPES
results, in Fig. 3 we show a minimal simulation of the
spin-polarization of the photocurrent expected from the
fully spin-polarized initial states of our band structure
calculations shown in Fig. 1. To this end we adopt a
non-interacting single particle description of the photoe-
mission process and neglect all matrix element eﬀects. In
this simple model, I↑↓

Experimental conditions are taken into account by mul-
tiplying I↑↓
y with a Fermi function at the measurement
temperature, and convolving the spectral function with
a 2D Gaussian of width 120 meV and 0.08 ˚A−1 (cor-
responding to 0.8◦). EDCs for this simulated I↑↓
are
shown in Fig. 3(a) and (c) (blue and red lines) for the
same k± as were measured experimentally. The eﬀect of
the experimental resolution is evident in the presence of
a single broad peak instead of multiple sharp peaks at
the energy-momentum positions of the eigenvalues of the
calculation in Fig. 1. This broad peak nevertheless shows
a small asymmetry which changes sign with k. The Py
corresponding to these EDCs is found using Eq. 2 and
is plotted in Fig. 3(a) and (c) as solid grey lines. The
features of this simulated polarization signal are < 0.02,
which is below the noise level in our data (black cross
symbols). Hence, our experimental resolution, which is
similar to the one in Ref. 26, completely masks the spin
polarization of the initial state. The absence of a sig-
niﬁcant polarization signal in our SARPES data is thus
fully consistent with the spin-polarized subband struc-
ture shown in Fig. 1.

y

We further note that the simulated polarization signal,
shown in Fig. 3 (b) over the full range of the 2DEL dis-

persion, has little similarity with the corresponding ini-
tial state polarization shown in Fig. 1 (b). SARPES data
from complex systems such as the STO 2DEL are thus
highly prone to misinterpretation.
Indeed, it is nearly
impossible to deconvolve the simulation and unambigu-
ously deduce the initial state polarization from the Py
signal shown in Fig. 3 (b). Even with much improved
resolution and detailed knowledge of the subband struc-
ture, it would remain challenging to extract the spin tex-
ture following the usual ﬁtting procedures. Moreover,
in cases like the STO 2DEL, where the predicted spin-
splitting is smaller than the intrinsic quasiparticle life-
time broadening over most of energy-momentum space,
spin-interference eﬀects will further complicate the inter-
pretation of SARPES data34. In this case the initial state
spin polarization can no longer be understood from band
structure calculations that neglect interactions and the
entire notion of well deﬁned spin-states becomes ques-
tionable.

Next, we use the same approach as above to simulate
Py for the single band electronic structure with a giant
Rashba splitting of 100 meV and a Zeeman gap at the
Γ point as proposed by Santander-Syro et al.26. This
results in a polarization up to Py = ±0.9, shown as grey
dashed lines in Fig. 3(a) and (c), which is signiﬁcantly
greater than the noise level in our measurements. We
can thus unambiguously exclude a Rashba splitting of
this magnitude in our data.

In conclusion, we have presented SARPES data from
the STO (001) surface 2DEL prepared on in-situ frac-
tured surfaces with a band dispersion in excellent agree-
ment with all published HR-ARPES data9–11,13,15,35,36.

cant spin-polarization signal which is consistent with the
predicted small, unconventional Rashba splitting of the
2DEL subbands. These results exclude the possibility of
a giant spin splitting as it was reported in Ref. 26. The
origin of this discrepancy remains unclear. It could be
related to diﬀerences in the surfaces measured in each
case, however this seems unlikely given that the sub-
band structure observed by conventional ARPES is ubiq-
uitous and observed consistently for very diﬀerent sur-
face preparations9–11,13,15,35,36. Alternatively, Altmeyer
et al.22 proposed that an SARPES signal as was observed
in Ref. 26 might arise from ferromagnetic domains with

exchange-split bands and a remnant Rashba-like spin tex-
ture. However, the small in-plane spin component calcu-
lated for this scenario is diﬃcult to rationalize with the
large spin polarization signal found in Ref. 26.
