The isospin-asymmetry dependence of the nuclear matter equation of state obtained from mi-
croscopic chiral two- and three-body interactions in second-order many-body perturbation theory
is examined in detail. The quadratic, quartic and sextic coeﬃcients in the Maclaurin expansion
of the free energy per particle of inﬁnite homogeneous nuclear matter with respect to the isospin
asymmetry are extracted numerically using ﬁnite diﬀerences, and the resulting polynomial isospin-
asymmetry parametrizations are compared to the full isospin-asymmetry dependence of the free
energy. It is found that in the low-temperature and high-density regime where the radius of con-
vergence of the expansion is generically zero, the inclusion of higher-order terms beyond the leading
quadratic approximation leads overall to a signiﬁcantly poorer description of the isospin-asymmetry
dependence. In contrast, at high temperatures and densities well below nuclear saturation density,
the interaction contributions to the higher-order coeﬃcients are negligible and the deviations from
the quadratic approximation are predominantly from the noninteracting term in the many-body
perturbation series. Furthermore, we extract the leading logarithmic term in the isospin-asymmetry
expansion of the equation of state at zero temperature from the analysis of linear combinations of
ﬁnite diﬀerences. It is shown that the logarithmic term leads to a considerably improved description
of the isospin-asymmetry dependence of the free energy.

INTRODUCTION

The isospin-asymmetry dependence of the nuclear
thermodynamic equation of state (EoS) is essential for in-
terpreting data from intermediate-energy heavy-ion colli-
sions and for understanding various nuclear astrophysical
phenomena (for recent reviews, see Refs. [1, 2]). Assum-
ing charge symmetry of the strong interaction [3, 4], pre-
vious parametrizations of the isospin-asymmetry depen-
dence of the free energy per particle F (T, ρ, δ) of inﬁnite
homogeneous nuclear matter have employed the Maclau-
rin expansion

A2n(T, ρ) δ2n =: F[2N ](T, ρ, δ),

where T is the temperature, ρ = ρn + ρp is the total
nucleon density, and δ = (ρn − ρp)/ρ is the isospin asym-
metry with ρn/p the neutron/proton density. In Eq. (1)
the diﬀerent expansion (Maclaurin) coeﬃcients are given
by

racy of the approximation polynomials F[2N ](T, ρ, δ) for
small values of N . The importance of terms beyond the

leading quadratic order on various properties of neutron
stars has been stressed in Refs. [5–7].
In the present
work we explore in detail the convergence behavior of
the isospin-asymmetry expansion of the nuclear matter
EoS at zero and ﬁnite temperature employing second-
order many-body perturbation theory.
In particular,
for astrophysical simulations of core-collapse supernovae
and binary neutron-star mergers we examine the accu-
racy of the quadratic, quartic, and sextic approximations
F[2],[4],[6](T, ρ, δ) at high temperatures and densities up to
around twice saturation density.

From global ﬁts to nuclear binding energies, one ex-
pects that at zero temperature and densities around
nuclear saturation density, already the leading-order
quadratic (N = 1) approximation provides a good ap-
proximation to the exact isospin-asymmetry dependence
of F (T, ρ, δ). This has been supported by various many-
body calculations with microscopic nuclear forces [8–13].
The quartic Maclaurin coeﬃcient A4 was found to be of
small size ((cid:46) 1 MeV) in self-consistent mean ﬁeld the-
ory calculations employing phenomenological [5–7] and
microscopic [5, 14, 15] nuclear forces. Recent work [16],
however, has shown that perturbative contributions be-
yond the Hartree-Fock level give rise to a quartic coef-
ﬁcient A4 at zero temperature that is in fact singular;
i.e., the second-order contribution to F (T = 0, ρ, δ) is
not a smooth function of δ, but of diﬀerentiability class
C 3 only. At ﬁnite T , however, the same contribution
is smooth (C∞), but at very low temperatures it can-
not be analytic (C ω) since for T → 0 its higher-order
Maclaurin coeﬃcients diverge. At very low tempera-
tures the isospin-asymmetry expansion (of the second-
order perturbative contribution to the EoS) therefore
represents an asymptotic expansion with zero radius of

convergence.1 The question remains whether the radius
of convergence becomes ﬁnite for higher temperatures,
and more importantly in what region of the parameter
space isospin-asymmetry parametrizations F[2N ](T, ρ, δ)
beyond the leading quadratic order are useful. Further-
more, using a simple contact interaction in Ref.
[16]
a diﬀerent expansion that includes logarithmic terms
∼ δ2n ln|δ| of the zero-temperature EoS was identiﬁed;
however, the applicability of this expansion in the case
of realistic nuclear interactions has not yet been studied.
In the present work we investigate these issues using
the modern chiral eﬀective ﬁeld theory (χEFT) approach
to low-momentum nuclear interactions.
In χEFT, nu-
clear interactions are organized in a systematic expansion
that naturally includes multi-nucleon forces. While the
low-energy expansion (power counting) can be adapted
for ﬁnite-density systems [18–22], a complementary ap-
proach is to use free-space χEFT interactions in nuclear
many-body calculations with the pertinent low-energy
constants ﬁtted to scattering observables and properties
of light nuclei. This approach amounts to a prediction
of nuclear many-body properties from the underlying ef-
fective microscopic theory without further ﬁne-tuning.
The framework allows to estimate theoretical uncertain-
ties (for recent developments see Refs. [23–27]), although
calculations with complete uncertainty propagation re-
main a challenge.

In an EFT the ultraviolet momentum cutoﬀ Λ is a
variable parameter. Employing interactions with suit-
ably low values of Λ enables a perturbative calculation
of nuclear thermodynamics. Using low-momentum chiral
nuclear interactions in many-body perturbation theory,
a realistic thermodynamic EoS of inﬁnite homogeneous
nuclear matter has been obtained in Refs. [28, 29]. More
speciﬁcally, the results for the EoS of isospin-symmetric
nuclear matter and the symmetry energy are consistent
with empirical constraints, and the EoS of pure neutron
matter at low fugacities reproduces approximately the
virial expansion [30]. This motivates a detailed study of
the isospin-asymmetry dependence of the EoS from per-
turbative calculations with chiral nuclear interactions.

In this paper we examine the isospin-asymmetry ex-
pansion of the nuclear EoS obtained from the sets of
microscopic chiral low-momentum N3LO two-body and
N2LO three-body interactions n3lo414 (Λ = 414MeV) and
n3lo450 (Λ = 450 MeV) constructed in Refs. [31–33] and
used in nuclear many-body calculations and astrophysical
studies in Refs. [28, 29, 32–37]. In particular, assuming
a quadratic dependence on the isospin asymmetry of the
interaction contributions to the free energy per particle,
in Ref. [29] a detailed study of the liquid-gas phase transi-
tion of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter was conducted.
In the present paper we now analyse in detail the isospin-

asymmetry dependence of the interaction contributions,
and extract the Maclaurin coeﬃcients A2,4,6(T, ρ) nu-
merically from higher-order ﬁnite-diﬀerence approxima-
tions. Using the results for A2,4,6(T, ρ) we then com-
pare the resulting approximation polynomials to the full
isospin-asymmetry dependence of the EoS. Since the dif-
ferent many-body contributions behave diﬀerently with
respect to the isospin-asymmetry expansion, we examine
the Maclaurin coeﬃcients for each contribution individ-
ually.

The paper is organized as follows. Sec. II provides
details of the calculations and an examination of the
Maclaurin expansion of the individual many-body con-
tributions. In addition, in Sec. II we extract the leading
logarithmic term in the isospin-asymmetry expansion of
the zero-temperature EoS. In Sec. III we discuss the re-
sults obtained for the quadratic, quartic and sextic co-
eﬃcients. In Sec. IV we then compare the full isospin-
asymmetry dependent free energy to various approxima-
tions. Finally, Sec. V provides a summary of the paper.

II. DETAILS OF THE CALCULATION

In this section we examine the isospin-asymmetry ex-
pansion of the noninteracting contribution2 and the inter-
action contributions to the nuclear matter EoS. For the
computation of the Maclaurin coeﬃcients correspond-
ing to the interaction contributions, ﬁnite-diﬀerence ap-
proximations have been used. We discuss the accu-
racy of the ﬁnite-diﬀerence method and (at zero tem-
perature) benchmark against the analytic results for the
second-order contribution with an S-wave contact inter-
action. The leading logarithmic term in the expansion of
the second-order contribution at zero temperature is ex-
tracted from the analysis of linear combinations of ﬁnite
diﬀerences.

A. Deﬁnitions

The symmetry free energy is deﬁned as the diﬀerence
between the free energy per particle of pure neutron mat-
ter (δ = 1) and the free energy per particle of isospin-
symmetric nuclear matter (δ = 0):

Fsym(T, ρ) = F (T, ρ, 1) − F (T, ρ, 0).

The accuracy of the leading-order quadratic isospin-
asymmetry approximation is inversely related to the

i.e., the radius of convergence of the Maclaurin expansion
of the noninteracting EoS is Rδ = 1.
Comparing ζ2N|ρ(cid:54)=0,T→0 ∈ {0.035, 0.044, 0.048, 0.050}
and ζ2N|T→∞ = ζ2N|T(cid:54)=0,ρ→0 ∈ { 0.120, 0.168, 0.194,
0.210 } for N ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5} with the associated values
of ξ → (0.054, 0.279), one can deduce that the isospin-
asymmetry expansion of the free Fermi gas EoS becomes
less accurate (at a ﬁxed order N ) for increasing values of
T and decreasing values of ρ. In particular, in Ref. [29]
it was shown that the ratios A2n/A2(n+1) are at ﬁnite
density monotonic decreasing functions of temperature
and at ﬁnite temperature monotonic increasing functions
of density, and the T → ∞ limiting values are approached
relatively quickly as the temperature is increased.

The Maclaurin coeﬃcients can in principle be com-
puted from the explicit expressions obtained for the
isospin-asymmetry derivatives (at ﬁxed density and tem-
perature) of the diﬀerent many-body contributions. The
length of these expressions however increases rapidly with
the order of the derivative. To avoid the numerical eval-
uation of these lengthy expressions we instead extract
the isospin-asymmetry derivatives numerically using ﬁ-
nite diﬀerences. The general form of the N -point central
ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation for A2n(T, ρ) is (using a
uniform grid with stepsize ∆δ and grid length N )

(12)
where N = 2N + 1 ≥ 2n + 1. The ﬁnite-diﬀerence
coeﬃcients ωN,k
can be determined by the algorithm
2n
given in Ref. [38]. The formal order of accuracy of the
ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation AN,∆δ
(T, ρ) for A2n(T, ρ)
is ∆δ2N−2n+2. Because F (T, ρ, δ) can be calculated only
to a ﬁnite accuracy, ∆δ cannot be chosen arbitrarily small
without the results being aﬀected by numerical noise.
Varying N and ∆δ provides a means to test the valid-
ity of the results for A2n(T, ρ).
If the ﬁnite-diﬀerence
approximation is valid, the result should not change un-
der (moderate) variations of N and ∆δ. Since the size
of the higher-order derivatives as well as the numerical
accuracy varies with the respective many-body contribu-
tion as well as the values of the external parameters T
and ρ, this variation needs to be carried out for every
individual contribution and for every single EoS point.
Carrying out this procedure and systematically increas-
ing the precision of the numerical integration routine in
the process, we were able to obtain accurate results for
the quadratic, quartic, sextic and to a slightly lesser de-
gree of precision also the octic Maclaurin coeﬃcients. In
addition, we have extracted the higher-order Maclaurin
coeﬃcients also by applying the ﬁnite-diﬀerence method
iteratively, i.e., by evaluating ﬁnite diﬀerences of

(13)

The iterative method involves variable stepsizes and grid
lengths at every iteration step and thus behaves diﬀer-
ently concerning error systematics; for adequate values
of ∆δ and N the iterative method gives matching re-
sults. Moreover, as an additional check we have ex-
tracted the Maclaurin coeﬃcients for the (total) free en-
ergy per particle F (T, ρ, δ) both by applying ﬁnite diﬀer-
ences to the data F (T, ρ, δ) and by summing the Maclau-
rin coeﬃcients obtained for the individual many-body

contributions. Finally, we note that in the case of the
Hartree-Fock contribution from chiral N2LO three-body
forces at zero temperature, semi-analytical expressions
for the Maclaurin coeﬃcients can be derived; the results
for the sextic coeﬃcient obtained in this way were found
to match the results predicted by the ﬁnite-diﬀerence
method up to four relevant digits.

D. Hartree-Fock level

In the following we examine the numerical results for
A2,4,6(T, ρ) associated with the ﬁrst-order contributions
from two- and three-nucleon interactions. We will ﬁnd
that at the Hartree-Fock level the Maclaurin coeﬃcients
are hierarchically ordered, A2 > A4 > A6 ( > A8), and
accordingly ζ4 (cid:39) ζ6 (cid:39) ξ, which indicates that the isospin-
asymmetry expansion converges at this level.

The results for the quadratic, quartic and sextic
Maclaurin coeﬃcients of F1,NN(T, ρ, δ) are displayed in
the left column of Fig. 1. Also shown are the results
for Fsym − A2. One sees that the quadratic coeﬃcient
A2 greatly outweighs the higher-order coeﬃcients and
matches the symmetry free energy Fsym with high accu-
racy. Only at high temperatures are the absolute values
of all Maclaurin coeﬃcients monotonic increasing func-
tions of density and decreasing functions of temperature;
at low temperatures 0 < T (cid:46) 5 MeV the quartic co-
eﬃcient exhibits nonmonotonic behavior. The Maclau-
rin coeﬃcients are hierarchically ordered in the high-
temperature regime, A2 (cid:29) A4 (cid:29) A6. This behavior
breaks down to some extent at low temperatures where
A4 and A6 are of similar size. Note that the deviations

between the n3lo414 and n3lo450 results are signiﬁcantly
reduced in the case of A4 and A6 as compared to A2.

part of the kernel K(Fock) given by Eq. (21) in Ref. [28]
proportional to the low-energy constant ci.

In the right column of Fig. 1 the Maclaurin coeﬃcients
for F1,3N(T, ρ, δ) are shown, as well as the corresponding
results for Fsym − A2. Overall, the temperature and den-
sity dependence of the ﬁrst-order three-body Maclaurin
coeﬃcients is similar to the behavior of the ﬁrst-order
two-body results (and opposite to the behavior for a non-
interacting two-species Fermi gas). Similar to the two-
body results, the n3lo414 and n3lo450 results are quite
similar for A4 and A6 while the A2 values diﬀer more sig-
niﬁcantly. However, A2 is relatively small and Fsym − A2
is signiﬁcantly larger for the three-body contribution, in
particular for n3lo414 where A4 > A2 at low values of T .
The relatively small size of A2 results from the cancella-
tion of contributions proportional to diﬀerent low-energy
constants (LECs). For diﬀerent choices of the LECs (for
example, Nijmegen LECs, cf. Ref. [28]) the overall size of
the ﬁrst-order three-body contribution to A2 (and also
to A0) can be increased.

where the single-particle energies are given by ε(k, τ ) =
k2/(2M ). At ﬁnite temperature the integrand in Eq.
(18) is smooth, but (for a gapless spectrum) at zero tem-
perature it diverges at the boundary of the integration
region. This is the origin of the singularity of A2n≥4 at
zero temperature.

At zero temperature the Fermi-Dirac distribution func-
tions in Eq. (19) become step functions, which can be
absorbed into the boundaries of the integrals. The ﬁrst
part of the numerator of G is associated with the follow-
ing conditions on the angular integrals:

At second order, the expressions for the contributions
involving 3N interactions become more involved. A sub-
set of the diagrams can be simpliﬁed by approximating
the genuine 3N interactions by a temperature-, isospin-
asymmetry- and density-dependent eﬀective two-body
(DDNN) potential ¯VDDNN(T, µn
0), cf. Refs. [28, 39],
which is constructed by closing one nucleon line and in-
tegrating over the ﬁlled Fermi sea (see also Refs. [26, 40–
44] for further details). In this approximation the total
second-order (normal) contribution is given by substitut-
ing in Eq. (18) for ¯VNN the quantity ¯Vtotal(T, µn
0) =
¯VNN + ¯VDDNN(T, µn
The np-channel results (using the NN potential only)
for A2,4,6(T, ρ) and Fsym(T, ρ) − A2(T, ρ) are displayed
in Fig. 2. Similar to the results for the ﬁrst-order two-
body contribution, Fsym − A2 is small. Again the dif-
ferences between the n3lo414 and n3lo450 results are
signiﬁcantly decreased for A4 and A6 as compared to
A2. In the high-temperature and low-density region it is
A2 (cid:29) A4 > A6 ( > A8), which indicates that the second-
order contribution is an analytic function of the isospin
asymmetry when the temperature (density) is suﬃciently
large (small). At high density and low temperature, how-
ever, this behavior breaks down, and terms beyond A2 di-
verge with alternating sign in the zero-temperature limit.
This observation will be addressed in detail in the follow-
ing subsection.

Up to now we have focused attention on the np-channel
(normal) contributions (from NN forces only) at sec-
ond order in many-body perturbation theory.
In fact,
this term gives the dominant contribution to the isospin-
asymmetry dependence. In Table I we compare the re-
sults for diﬀerent second-order (normal) contributions
to A2n(T, ρ), i.e., the np-channel NN contribution, the
total NN contribution, and the total contribution with
the combined NN and DDNN potential. One sees that
for the higher-order Maclaurin coeﬃcients the diﬀerence
between the total NN and the np-channel NN contri-
bution almost vanishes, which indicates that the nn-
and pp-channels are regular also for realistic nuclear in-
teractions.3 The deviations between the NN and the
NN+DDNN results are more sizable, but the Maclaurin
coeﬃcients are still of similar order of magnitude. Be-
cause the numerical evaluation of the second-order con-

tribution becomes more involved with the DDNN poten-
tial included, in the present paper we have restricted the
detailed examination of the isospin-asymmetry expansion
at second-order perturbation theory to the (np-channel)
NN contribution.

The calculations of Refs. [28, 29] include (ﬁrst-order)
self-energy corrections to the single-particle energies ap-
pearing in the expression for the second-order (normal)
diagram, i.e.,

where M∗ is called the eﬀective mass. At the Hartree-
Fock level, the eﬀective mass is a decreasing function of
density and ranges from 0.6− 0.7M in isospin-symmetric
nuclear matter at saturation density. Higher-order per-
turbative corrections increase the eﬀective mass close to
the bare mass [10, 43, 45, 46] in the vicinity of the Fermi
surface. In the present study, we have not included self-
energy insertions into the second-order diagrams, since
the global eﬀective mass plus energy shift approximation
in Eq. (21) does not provide suﬃcient accuracy when im-
plemented in the extraction of the higher-order Maclau-
rin coeﬃcients. A more precise treatment including the
exact momentum dependence may be warranted.

F. Extraction of leading logarithmic term at zero

temperature

To better understand the divergent behavior in the
higher-order Maclaurin coeﬃcients seen in the previous
section for the second-order (normal) diagram, we con-
sider now the simpler case of an S-wave contact interac-
tion Vcontact = πM−1(as + 3at + (at − as)(cid:126)σ1 · (cid:126)σ2).

3 Although at very low temperatures we were not able to obtain
accurate results for the nn- and pp-channel A4,6,8 (owing to the
structure of G), we have observed that the ﬁnite-diﬀerence results

are small and do not show an approximately logarithmic stepsize
dependence at zero temperature.

For the S-wave contact interaction the (dimensionally regularized [47]) second-order (normal) contribution can be
written as

i.e., the degree of divergence increases with n, and all

the δ → 0 limits of the isospin-asymmetry derivatives

possible at ﬁnite temperature where F2 ∈ C∞, and hence
∂2n+1F2/∂δ2n+1 = 0 at δ = 0 (by charge symmetry). If
∂4F2/∂δ4 has positive slope for T (cid:54)= 0 and δ → 0 then it
must be convex at δ = 0, thus ∂6F2/∂δ6 can only diverge
with positive sign and curvature for δ = 0 and T → 0,
etc.

Eq. (27) results in a stepsize dependence of the follow-
ing form in the quartic and sextic ﬁnite-diﬀerence formu-
las:

(29)

This is explained as follows. As can be inferred from
Eq. (28), at zero temperature the higher-order isospin-
asymmetry derivatives ∂2nF2/∂δ2n, for n ≥ 2, all have
positive (isospin-asymmetry) slope and negative (isospin-
asymmetry) curvature for δ = 0 + . This behavior is im-

The small contribution (cf. Fig. 3) to A4,reg from the second-order (normal) diagram is neglected.

approximately exhibit the logarithmic and

pected from Eqs. (30) and (31). In addition, Ξ4(N1, N2)

The results are plotted in the upper insets of Figs.

For large stepsizes the AN,∆δ
results are of similar size
for both cases, but the values obtained for A4,reg (cid:39)
AN,∆δ
are smaller for the chiral interactions as compared
to the spin-triplet S-wave contact interaction, where

Finally, in the lower insets of Figs. 3 and 4 we show

mately stepsize independent.

III. THRESHOLD FOR CONVERGENCE OF

THE MACLAURIN EXPANSION

The numerical results for the Maclaurin coeﬃcients
A2,4,6(T, ρ) of the EoS of inﬁnite homogeneous nuclear
matter obtained from the sets of chiral two- and three-
body interactions n3lo414 and n3lo450 are displayed in
Fig. 5. Only the dominant contributions at second or-
der in perturbation theory are included. Also shown is
the diﬀerence between the quadratic coeﬃcients A2(T, ρ)
and the symmetry free energy Fsym(T, ρ) = F (T, ρ, 1) −
F (T, ρ, 0). Overall, the results from n3lo414 and n3lo450
are very similar; the largest diﬀerences occur for the
quadratic coeﬃcient A2 at high densities. The devia-
tions between Fsym and A2 increase with temperature,
but whereas for a noninteracting nucleon gas Fsym − A2
(slightly) increases with density, for the interacting sys-
tem Fsym − A2 decreases with density. This diﬀerence in
behavior is predominantly from the Hartree-Fock three-
nucleon force contributions. Compared to the results for
Fsym(T, ρ) from Ref. [29] the temperature dependence of
A2(T, ρ) is decreased in the case of n3lo414 and inverted
for n3lo450 (at densities above saturation density).

In the high-temperature and low-density region the
Maclaurin coeﬃcients obey A2 > A4 > A6(> A8), with

Figure 6. (Color online) Threshold line for the convergence
of the isospin-asymmetry expansion of the free energy per
particle, see text for details.

|ξ − ζ6| < |ξ − ζ4|. This behavior breaks down when the
temperature is decreased and the density is increased,
leading to A2 (cid:28) A4 (cid:28) A6((cid:28) A8) at high densities and
low temperatures. In the sense that the expansion coef-
ﬁcients are hierarchically ordered at high temperatures
and low densities the Maclaurin expansion with respect

in the low-temperature and high-density region. To that
eﬀect, one can loosely identify a threshold line that sepa-
rates the two regions. This line (roughly corresponding to
|ξ − ζ4| = |ξ − ζ6|) is sketched in Fig. 6. Note that since
the divergent behavior is more pronounced for A2(n+1)
than for A2n (cf. also Fig. 7), one can expect that this
threshold line rises when the isospin-asymmetry expan-
sion is probed at increasing orders.

The strongly divergent behavior of the higher-order
Maclaurin coeﬃcients below the threshold line arises
solely from the second-order many-body contribution. At
the Hartree-Fock level the coeﬃcients are hierarchically
ordered A2 > A4 > A6(> A8) also at high densities
and low temperatures, and the Mauclaurin expansion is
overall well-converged. This explains why self-consistent
mean-ﬁeld theory calculations [5, 7, 14, 15, 48] have given
small values of A4 at zero temperature.

The question arises whether the nonanalyticity with
respect to the isospin-asymmetry at low temperatures
(i..e, the divergent behavior of the higher-order Maclau-
rin coeﬃcients) is a genuine feature of the nuclear EoS
or a feature that arises from probing higher-order deriva-
tives of a perturbation series. It is however unlikely that
this question can be resolved since nonperturbative ap-

proaches to the nuclear many-body problem presumably
lack the precision for the numerical extraction of higher-
order isospin-asymmetry derivatives. Quartic coeﬃcients
extracted from ﬁts to nuclear masses have been relatively
large, see Refs. [49, 50], which could indicate that the
isospin-asymmetry dependence of the (low-temperature)
nuclear EoS is indeed nonanalytic. More relevant for
practical purposes is the question of the accuracy of the
isospin-asymmetry parametrizations F[2],[4],[6](T, ρ, δ) at
and beyond the leading quadratic order in the regions
near and above the threshold line.

One sees that the numerical noise becomes visible only
for very small values of ∆δ, and is more pronounced

In the case of the ﬁrst-order
many-body contributions the results are well converged
for a large region of ∆δ values. At low temperatures the
isospin-asymmetry dependence of the ﬁrst-order DDNN
contribution approximately matches that of the ﬁrst-
order contribution with genuine 3N forces, but this be-

served as ∆δ is increased. This bending gradually in-
creases as the temperature is decreased and the den-
sity increased, cf. the results for AN,∆δ
at

T = 4 MeV and ρ = 0.30 fm
ing is the large isospin-asymmetry slope (for low values
of δ (cid:54)= 0) and subsequent ﬂattening of the higher-order
isospin-asymmetry derivatives ∂nF/∂δn, n ≥ 4, in the
low-temperature and high-density regime. In particular,
the isospin-asymmetry derivatives ∂nF/∂δn, n ≥ 4, are
convex at δ = 0, but concave for intermediate values
of δ (this behavior can be inferred from evaluating the
isospin-asymmetry derivatives of the function Γnp given
by Eq. (26)). If the stepsize is chosen too large, the be-
havior near δ = 0 is not resolved, which leads to the
observed bending. However, as seen from Fig. 7 even
in that case a region where the stepsize dependence of
the ﬁnite-diﬀerence results approximately vanishes can
be found for small values of ∆δ. Note also that in the re-
gion where the stepsize dependence nearly vanishes also
the grid-length dependence is decreased.

ISOSPIN-ASYMMETRY
APPROXIMATIONS

Here, we examine the accuracy of various isospin-
asymmetry approximations with respect to the full
isospin-asymmetry dependence of the free energy per
particle F (T, ρ, δ).
the
leading-order quadratic approximation F[2](T, ρ, δ) =
A0(T, ρ) + A2(T, ρ) δ2 is determined by the magnitude
of Fsym(T, ρ) − A2(T, ρ). In particular, it is F (T, ρ, δ) −
F[2](T, ρ, δ) δ→1−−−→ Fsym(T, ρ) − A2(T, ρ). From Fig. 5 it
can be inferred that the accuracy of F[2](T, ρ, δ) is de-
creased at the high temperatures probed in astrophys-
ical simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary
neutron-star mergers.

The accuracy of the higher-order polynomial isospin-
asymmetry parametrizations F[4],[6](T, ρ, δ) depends on
the convergence behavior of the Maclaurin expansion
roughly given by the threshold line in Fig. 6. At low
densities and high temperatures including the quartic
and sextic Maclaurin coeﬃcients leads to an improved
approximation also for large isospin asymmetries. For
high densities or low temperatures the approximations
F[4],[6](T, ρ, δ) improve upon F[2](T, ρ, δ) only for very
small values of δ. As a representative case we compare
in Fig. 8 the isospin-asymmetry dependence of F (T, ρ, δ)
with the one of the quadratic, quartic and sextic polyno-
mial approximations F[2],[4],[6](T, ρ, δ) for T = 4 MeV and

For small isospin asymmetries including the quartic and

δ. In the neutron-rich regime the sextic and to a lesser
extent also the quartic approximations deviate signiﬁ-
cantly from the exact result. The critical value of δ for
which the accuracy of the higher-order approximations
becomes inferior to the leading quadratic one decreases
below the threshold line and vanishes (i.e., exceeds δ = 1)
for temperatures and densities above it.

In the zero-temperature case the following approxima-
tion of the zero-temperature EoS can be constructed from
the values for the leading logarithmic term extracted in
Sec. II E:

F[4,log](T = 0, ρ, δ) =A0(0, ρ) + A2(0, ρ) δ2 + A4,reg(ρ) δ4
(35)

+ A4,log(ρ) δ4 ln|δ|.

To identify the eﬀect of including the logarithmic term
we consider also the quartic approximation of the zero-
temperature EoS without the logarithmic term, i.e.,

F[4,nonlog](T = 0, ρ, δ) =A0(0, ρ) + A2(0, ρ) δ2

+ A4,reg(ρ) δ4.

(36)

We emphasize that the higher-order approximations at
zero temperature based on Eq. (27) should be distin-
guished from those for the ﬁnite-temperature EoS based
on the Maclaurin expansion Eq. (1). The results ob-
tained from Eqs. (35) and (36) are compared to the
quadratic approximation and the exact results in Fig.
9. One sees that including the logarithmic term consid-
erably improves the description of the isospin-asymmetry

tions improve upon the leading-order quadratic approx-
imation only for very small values of δ, and fail in the
neutron-rich regime.

The accuracy of the leading-order quadratic isospin-
asymmetry approximation is inversely related to the
magnitude of the diﬀerence between the quadratic
Maclaurin coeﬃcient A2(T, ρ) and the symmetry free
energy Fsym(T, ρ) = F (T, ρ, δ = 1) − F (T, ρ, δ = 0).
The quantity Fsym − A2 is signiﬁcantly increased for the
high temperatures relevant for astrophysical simulations
of core-collapse supernovae and receives its main contri-
butions from the noninteracting term and the ﬁrst-order
contribution from chiral three-nucleon forces, with the
respective contributions carrying opposite signs (at high
temperatures or low densities the noninteracting contri-
bution dominates). Because the convergence rate of the
expansion of the noninteracting contribution decreases
signiﬁcantly with temperature (in contrast to the behav-
ior of the interaction contributions), a better approxi-
mation in the high-temperature regime is to calculate
the noninteracting term exactly, and employ polynomial
isospin-asymmetry parametrizations only for the interac-
tion contributions, cf. Ref. [29].

Based on the analytic results for an S-wave contact in-
teraction to second order, it was demonstrated that the
leading singular term at zero temperature is logarithmic,
∼ δ4 ln|δ|, also in the case of realistic chiral nuclear inter-
actions. The logarithmic term has been extracted from
the analysis of linear combinations of ﬁnite diﬀerences,
and it was found that the inclusion of this term leads
to a signiﬁcantly improved description of the isospin-
asymmetry dependence of the zero-temperature equation
of state. Future research will adress the inﬂuence of the
logarithmic term on properties of neutron stars.

For a ﬁnite system the higher-order Maclaurin coeﬃ-
cients are ﬁnite at zero temperature, but diverge in the
continuum limit. Hence, the higher-order perturbative
contributions are still nonanalytic functions of the isospin
asymmetry for suﬃciently large particle numbers (anal-
ogous to the behavior of the inﬁnite system at low tem-
peratures). Similar considerations apply for the case of
inﬁnite nuclear matter with a pairing gap. The ques-
tion remains whether this nonanalyticity with respect to
the isospin-asymmetry arises as a feature of perturbation
theory only or is a genuine feature of the nuclear equation
of state.

For neutron-rich matter it may be useful to consider an
alternative parametrization of the isospin-asymmetry de-
pendence in the form of an expansion in the proton frac-
tion Yp = (1 − δ)/2. Work along this line is in progress.

V. SUMMARY

In this work we have examined the isospin-asymmetry
expansion of the free energy per particle of
inﬁnite
homogeneous nuclear matter using second-order many-
body perturbation theory with microscopic chiral low-
momentum N3LO two- and N2LO three-body interac-
tions. The quadratic, quartic and sextic Maclaurin
coeﬃcients A2,4,6(T, ρ) corresponding to the expansion
of the various many-body contributions have been ex-
tracted numerically using ﬁnite-diﬀerence methods.
It
has been found that the higher-order Maclaurin coef-
ﬁcients A2n≥4(T, ρ) are hierarchically ordered at high
temperatures (and low densities), but diverge with alter-
nating sign (for even and odd values of n) and increas-
ing order of divergence for increasing values of n in the
zero-temperature limit. As a consequence, in the low-
temperature regime the free energy per particle is a non-
analytic (smooth for T (cid:54)= 0) function of the isospin asym-
metry δ, i.e., the Maclaurin expansion in terms of δ con-
stitutes a divergent asymptotic expansion in that regime.
The divergent behavior is caused solely by the np-channel
second-order contribution in the many-body expansion
and is therefore not visible in (self-consistent) mean-
ﬁeld calculations of the nuclear equation of state.
In
the low-temperature and high-density region, the quartic
and sextic polynomial isospin-asymmetry parametriza-
