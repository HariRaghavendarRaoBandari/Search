The magnetic orders in Na2IrO3 and α−RuCl3, honeycomb systems with strong spin-orbit cou-
pling and correlations, have been recently described by models with the dominant Kitaev interac-
tions. In this work we discuss how the orientation of magnetic order parameter is selected in this
class of models. We show that while the order-by-disorder mechanism in the models with solely Ki-
taev anisotropies always select cubic axes as easy axes for magnetic ordering, the additional eﬀect of
other small bond-dependent anisotropies, such as, e.g., Γ-terms, lead to a deviation of the order pa-
rameter from the cubic directions. We show that both the zigzag ground state and the face-diagonal
orientation of magnetic moments in Na2IrO3 can be obtained within the J1 − K1 − J2 − K2 − J3
model in the presence of perturbatively small Γ-terms. We also show that the zigzag phase found
in the nearest neighbor Kitaev-Heisenberg model, relevant for α−RuCl3, has some stability against
the Γ-term.

INTRODUCTION

onal geometries.7–11,28–30

The long-standing quest for a solid state realization
of the Kitaev honeycomb model1 has triggered much of
experimental and theoretical interest in 4d and 5d com-
pounds with hexagonal geometries, in which the interplay
of the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and electronic
correlations lead to a dominance of strongly anisotropic,
bond-dependent Kitaev-like interactions.3

The Kitaev model belongs to the class of the compass
models and is intrinsically frustrated due to its bond-
depended nature, which in the quantum case leads to
the appearance of the non-trivial spin liquid phase with
fractionalized excitations.1 Kitaev spin liquid is not a
unique example of non-trivial ground states of the com-
pass models,2,4 however, it is probably the only one which
allows an exact analytic solution.

In particular, a lot of experimental eﬀort has been
focused on iridium oxides belonging to the A2IrO3
family.5–11 In these compounds, edge-shared IrO6 octa-
hedra provide 90◦ paths for Kitaev-like super-exchange
coupling among the eﬀective J = 1/2 magnetic mo-
ments arising from Ir4+. A similar situation exists for
Ru3+ ions in the isostructural layered honeycomb mate-
rial α−RuCl3.12–18

The Kitaev interaction has the form(cid:80)

where K γ is an exchange interaction on a bond γ, which
can connect nearest or next nearest neighbor magnetic
ions, and may be either antiferro- and ferromagnetic de-
pending on the compound.19–25 Conventional isotropic
Heisenberg couplings are also present in these compounds
due to the octachedron edge sharing geometry and di-
rect overlap of 5d− or 4d−orbitals which due to their
extended nature often reach beyond nearest neighbors.
Further anisotropies, such as the isotropic oﬀ-diagonal
Γ interactions, have also been proposed, mainly as a re-
sult of crystal ﬁeld distortions.22,26,27 The competition
between all these couplings leads to a rich variety of mag-
netic structures including zigzag, spiral and non-coplanar
spirals observed in the 4d and 5d compounds with hexag-

temperature phase of Na2IrO3 has the collinear zigzag
long-range magnetic order.5–11 In addition, recent diﬀuse
magnetic x-ray scattering data clearly determined the
spin orientation in this zigzag state and showed that it is
along the 44.3◦ direction with respect to the a axis, which
corresponds to approximately half way in between the cu-
bic x and y axes.11 Both of these ﬁndings are in disagree-
ment with the original Kitaev-Heisenberg model,19,20
which predicts the zigzag phase only for the antiferro-
magnetic nearest neighbor Kitaev interaction, while the
Kitaev interaction in Na2IrO3 is ferromagnetic,21 and or-
dering of the magnetic moments occurs along cubic axes.
This shows that one needs to extend the nearest neighbor
model by including some additional interactions in order
to explain these experimental observations.
α−RuCl3 also shows collinear zigzag long-range mag-
netic order.14,16–18 However, the microscopic origin of the
zigzag ground state is quite diﬀerent, as in this compound
the Kitaev interaction is antiferromagnetic. Moreover, as
it was recently shown by X-ray and neutron scattering
diﬀraction data,17,18 the best ﬁt to the collinear structure
is obtained when the spin direction points 35◦ out of the
ab-plane, i.e. along one of the cubic directions. Thus, in
principle, this compound can be described by the nearest
neighbor Kitaev-Heisenberg model20 with other subdom-
inant anisotropic interactions, e.g., the Γ-term, which
must be constrained by these observations.

In both cases, the available experimental data provide
an important check of the validity of any model pro-
posed to describe the magnetic properties of Na2IrO3 and
α−RuCl3, as it should correctly predict not only the type
of the magnetic order but also its orientation in space. In
this work we consider two models, the nearest neighbor
Kitaev-Heisenberg model3,19,20 and its more complicated
counterpart, dubbed J1 − K1 − J2 − K2 − J3 model,22
and study how the preferred directions of the mean ﬁeld
order parameter vector are selected in these models. The

component of the pseudospin Sγ
ν,j = 1/2, on sublattices
ν = 0, 1. Hereafter, we call these pseudospins simply
spins. J and K correspond to the Heisenberg and Kitaev
interactions, which in the extended model can be both
AF and FM. γ = x, y, z denote the spin components in
the global reference frame.

The classical phase diagram of the model (1) contains
four magnetic phases:20,33 the ferromagnetic phase (Fig.
1 (a)), the N´eel antiferromagnet (Fig. 1(b)), the stripy
antiferromagnet (Fig. 1 (c)) and the zigzag antiferromag-
net (Fig. 1 (d)). The latter two magnetic states have four
sublattice structure.

All these phases have macroscopic classical degener-
acy. While the classical degeneracy of the simple FM
state and of the AF N´eel state comes straightforwardly
from the inﬁnite number of degenerate collinear states,
the macroscopic degeneracy of the AF stripy and zigzag
phases is more complex, and the degenerate ground state
manifold consists of six collinear states and a set of non-
collinear multi-Q states. In Appendix A we discuss this
question in detail and show that using the four-sublattice
Klein transformation for the stripy and the zigzag AF
states,19,27,44 the nature of the classical degeneracy of
all four magnetically ordered states can be understood
in a similar way. Importantly, in all cases, the classical
degeneracy is accidental and is removed by the order by
disorder mechanism which selects a set of collinear states,
each with a particular direction of the order parameter.
Following Chaloupka et al,19 we introduce four aux-
iliary sublattices A, B, C and D (see Fig.1 (e)), ﬁx the
direction of spins on the sublattice A and rotate the spins
on the subllatices B,C and D such that the component
of spin corresponding to the bond direction (x for B, y
for C and z for D) stays the same but two other spin
components change sign. This results in the transformed
Hamiltonian with the same form as (1) but with trans-
formed couplings.

Here we consider the Kitaev-Heisenberg model in the
full parameter space. For the parameters of the model
for which either stripy or zigzag are the ground states,
we perform four-sublattice transformation and treat the
model (1) in the rotated basis, in which the stripy state
maps to the FM and the zigzag state maps to the simple
two-sublattice AFM N´eel state.

Next, using a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation of
the partition function,31,32 we discuss how the preferred
directions of the order parameter in all these phases
are selected by thermal or quantum ﬂuctuations below

by determining which orientations of the order parameter
correspond to the free energy minimum. This approach
was outlined in Refs.31,32 to which we refer the reader for
technical details. We also explore the eﬀects of small Γ
anisotropy on the direction of the order parameter in the
zigzag phase in the two models.

The explicit expression for the matrix elements of the

(sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ) are given in Appendix B.

While the mean-ﬁeld part of the free energy has the full
rotational symmetry, its ﬂuctuational part, Fﬂuct, is sen-
sitive to the direction of the mean-ﬁeld order parameter.
Thus, by ﬁnding the minima of the ﬂuctuational part of
the free energy, we can pin the spontaneous magnetiza-
tion along some preferred direction of the lattice.
Fig.2 (a) shows the angular dependence of ﬂuctuational
free energy Fﬂuct(θ, φ) computed for representative pa-
rameters J = −2.9 meV and K = 8.1 meV, at which the
ground state order is the antiferromagnetic zigzag. The
magnitude of Fﬂuct(θ, φ) is presented as a color-coded
plot on the unit sphere, where the minima and maxima
of the free energy are shown by deep blue and red color,
correspondingly. We see that the minima of Fﬂuct(θ, φ)
are achieved when the magnetization is directed along
one of the cubic axes.

This ﬁnding shows that the contribution of ﬂuctuations
to the free energy removes the degeneracy of the ground
state found on the mean ﬁeld level. The states which

bor couplings were taken into account phenomenologi-
cally and only the isotropic part of these interactions was
included. The importance of additional nearest neigh-
bor C3-symmetric anisotropic terms (Γ-terms)26,27 or of
the spatial anisotropy of the nearest neighbor Kitaev
interactions,37 were also discussed in the literature as a
possible source for the stabilization of the zigzag phase.
Here we consider the J1 − K1 − J2 − K2 − J3 model,22
which still has the same symmetry as the original Kitaev-
Heisenberg model but contains Kitaev interactions be-
tween both nearest and second nearest neighbors. The

est neighbor and third nearest neighbor, respectively.
γ = x, y, z and ˜γ = ˜x, ˜y, ˜z denote the three types of
nearest neighbor and second nearest neighbor bonds of
the honeycomb lattice, respectively.
It is important to
note that the second neighbor Kitaev interactions do
not change the space group symmetries of the original
Kitaev-Heisenberg model.

For realistic sets of parameters describing Na2IrO3, the
second neighbor Kitaev interaction, K2, computed from
the microscopic approach based on the ab-initio calcula-
tion by Foevtsova et al,38,39 appeared to be the largest
interaction after the nearest neighbor Kitaev interaction,
K1, and turn out to be antiferromagnetic. The mech-
anism behind the large magnitude of K2 in Na2IrO3 is
physically very clear: It originates from the large diﬀusive
Na ions that reside in the middle of the exchange path-
ways, and the constructive interference of a large number
of pathways. Moreover, the K1-K2 model, that only in-
cludes Kitaev interactions,24 already stabilizes the zigzag
phase for the proper signs of K1 and K2. However, as
we have discussed in Ref.24, the K1-K2 model is still not
suﬃcient to comply with all available experimental data.
The classical degeneracy of the zigzag state obtained
within the J1 − K1 − J2 − K2 − J3 model with FM K1 is
diﬀerent from the one of the zigzag state realized in the
extended Kitaev-Heisenberg model with AFM K1 inter-
action. To see what diﬀerence the sign of K1 makes, let
us consider the zigzag pattern in Fig.1 (d). With AFM
K1, the pattern, that minimizes the classical energy in
the zigzag state with ferromagnegnetic y and z bonds,
has the spins pointing along the x−axis to take advan-
tage of the Kitaev interaction on the AFM x-bonds. On
the other hand the same pattern with FM K1 takes ad-
vantage of the Kitaev interaction on the FM y− and z−
bonds by putting spins in the yz−plane. Thus the de-
generate ground state manifold for a given zigzag pattern
is one of xy−, yz−, or zx− planes. Furthermore, when
the Klein duality 4-sublattice transformation19 is applied

with order parameter pointing along one of the cubic

simulations33–35 and spin wave analysis by Chaloupka et
al.19
We discuss the relevance of our ﬁndings for the nearest
neighbor Kitaev-Heisenberg model for α−RuCl3 in Sec.
IV. However in the next section, we will ﬁrst consider
the selection of the direction of the order parameter in
extensions of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model relevant for
Na2IrO3.

III. ORDER BY DISORDER IN

J1 − K1 − J2 − K2 − J3 MODEL

Despite extensive eﬀorts, no consensus concerning the
minimal model for Na2IrO3 has been reached yet. The
most natural extension of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model
with ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction which captures
the zigzag magnetic order can be obtained by inclusion
of farther neighbor couplings.
In Na2IrO3, these cou-
plings might be not-negligible due to the extended na-
ture of 5d-orbitals of Ir ions. In the early works suggest-
ing this possible extension,9,36 second and third neigh-

Γ-terms. The role of these terms in the nearest-neighbor
Kitaev model has been studied in Refs.26,27. These stud-
ies have shown that the small Γ-terms do not immediately
destabilize the zigzag phase, but lead to a deviation of
the magnetic moments from the cubic axes.

The origin of Γ-terms can be easily seen from the most
general form of the bilinear exchange coupling matrix,
which on the bond (i, j) has the form given by

 J xx J xy J xz

J yx J yy J yz
J zx J zy J zz

 .

Ξi,j =

(12)

i Sβ

i Sα

j + Sβ

While the Kitaev term comes from the anisotropy of the
diagonal matrix elements of Ξi,j, the symmetric and an-
tisymmetric combinations of oﬀ-diagonal elements rep-
resent other types of possible bond-anisotropies. In the
absence of the trigonal distortion, the inversion symme-
try prohibits the existence of antisymmetric interactions
but some of the symmetric combinations are allowed, i.e.
on a given γ-bond, the interaction between the other two
spin components, Γγ(Sα
j ), is non-zero. Our
previous results22 suggest that in Na2IrO3 the magni-
tude of the strength of Γ on the nearest neighbor bonds
is about 2-3 meV and vanishes for the second neighbors.
Here we consider the J1 − K1 − J2 − K2 − J3 − Γ model
with the previous choice of Heisenberg and Kitaev in-
teractions and treat Γ as a free parameter. A straight-
forward classical minimization in momentum space us-
ing Luttinger-Tisza approach41–43 shows that up to very
large values of Γ ∼ 20 meV the minima of the classical
energy are located at the M points corresponding to the
zigzag states. This is clearly seen in Fig. 3(a) where
we plot the lowest eigenvalues obtained for Γ = 1 meV.
At larger values of Γ, the minima shift along the lines
connecting M points and the center of the Brillouin zone
(see Fig. 3 (b) for Γ = 20 meV), indicating the tran-
sition to incommensurate order. The exact value of Γ
at which the transition occurs is diﬃcult to determine
due to the transition being so smooth, Note, however,
that the transition occurs at values of Γ far beyond those
predicted from our microscopic calculations at ambient
pressure.22
After we have demonstrated that adding small Γ in-
teractions to the J1 − K1 − J2 − K2 − J3 model does
not destabilize the zigzag order, let us now show that in
the presence of Γ the mean-ﬁeld degeneracy is already
lifted and the preferred directions of the order parameter
are selected. By inspection, we can see that non-zero Γ
selects the face diagonals as easy axes for magnetic order-
ing, and the sign of Γ determines which of the two face
diagonals are preferred. For concreteness, let us consider
the zigzag with AFM z−bonds. As we discussed above
the case for Γ = 0, the easy xy-plane is selected at the
mean-ﬁeld level of the J1 − K1 − J2 − K2 − J3 model.
Then, the inclusion of positive Γ interaction on x and y
bonds gives zero contribution to the energy since on these
bonds it involves one of the spin components perpendic-
ular to the easy plane, but it gives maximal lowering of

FIG. 3: The lowest eigenvalue of the J1 − K1 − J2 − K2 − J3
model obtained with the Luttinger-Tisza method is shown on
the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. We use J1 = 3 meV, K1 = −17 meV,
J2 = −3 meV, K2 = 6 meV, J3 = 1 meV, and (a) Γ1 = 1
meV and (b) Γ1 = 20 meV.

to the J1 − K1 − J2 − K2 − J3 zigzags, these states do
not turn into N´eel AFM state, and instead turn into non-
collinear states, that are more diﬃcult to work with than
the original zigzag states. Working with the zigzag states
directly increases the magnetic unit cell to 4 sites, labeled
in Fig 1(d).

The Hamiltonian matrix in the momentum space can
be again written in the form of Eq.
(3), however this
time due to the larger unit cell the exchange matrix ˆJq is
12× 12, instead of 6× 6. Its matrix elements are given in
Appendix C. The ﬂuctuations matrix Aq,νν(cid:48) is calculated
as before according to equation (B1), with the constraint
matrix Cq,µ,µ(cid:48) of equation (B3) now containing 4 iden-
tical blocks instead of 2. The ﬂuctuation matrix again
contains the information on the direction of the spins and
transmits this information to the free energy corrections
that we plot in Fig. 2(b). Since the spins are conﬁned to
a plane for a given zigzag state we have only the angle
of the direction of spins in that plane. The color of the
band at a given angle then gives the size of the ﬂuctu-
ational correction to the free energy, with violet being
lowest and red highest energy states. We see that again
the Kitaev anisotropies prefer to align the magnetization
along the cubic axes. Note, however, that unlike the ex-
tended KH model, where there were 6 equivalent states,
here there are 4 directions for each of the three zigzag
patterns, giving a total of 12 states.

IV. THE ROLE OF OFF-DIAGONAL

SYMMETRIC Γ-TERM.

A. Directions of the ordered moments in Na2IrO3.

The discussion above has clearly shown, that neither
the original Kitaev model nor the extended J1 − K1 −
J2 − K2 − J3 model can correctly explain the experimen-
tal data in Na2IrO3. Since the easy axes directions are
determined solely by the anisotropy terms, only the in-
clusion of other types of the anisotropies can improve the
situation. Here we consider the oﬀ-diagonal symmetric

For larger Γ-interaction, the system prefers states with
at least two nonzero spin components and, therefore, the
transition towards [111] preferred directions of the order
parameter is taken place. This is shown in Fig. 5 (b)
and (c), in which the ﬂuctuational energy is plotted for
Γ = 0.8 meV and 0.9 meV. While in Fig. 5 (b) only
very shallow minima are seen along [111] directions, in
Fig. 5 (c) both the pronounced minima along the cu-
bic body diagonals and maxima along the cubic axes are
very clearly seen. Remember that the computation is
done in the rotated reference frame. Therefore, only the
state with the orientation of order parameter along the
cubic axes will give the collinear state in the unrotated
reference frame. The states with order parameter point-
ing along [111] directions in the rotated reference frame
correspond to non-collinear states in the unrotated ref-
erence frame. Since recent experiments by Cao et al.18
have established that spins point along a cubic axis, by
calculating the ﬂuctuational corrections as a function of
Γ, we can ﬁnd an upper bound on its value, such that the
Kitaev ﬂuctuations dominate and keep the cubic axes as
the preferred directions. From our calculations it fol-
lows that for J1 = −2.9 meV and K1 = 8.1 meV the
upper bound for Γ is about 0.8 meV. Finally, for this
set of parameters the transition to the 120◦- AFM or-
der occurs around Γ = 1.6 meV. Note that this estimate
is far smaller than the Γ values resulting from ab initio
calculations.25.

the energy on the z-bonds if the spins point along [110]
and [¯1¯10], [¯110] and [¯110] directions correspondingly for
positive and negative values of Γ. The estimate for the
smallest Γ, at which the selection of face diagonals takes
place, can be done by comparing the mean-ﬁeld energy
gain due to Γ with the energy gain due to ﬂuctuations at
Γ = 0, which at T = 0 is equal to the zero point energy
and is a function of K1 and K2. At ﬁnite temperature,
the contribution to the energy from the Gaussian ﬂuctu-
ations at each T can be computed by our method, and
this energy will give the lower bound for the magnitude
of Γ needed to change the orientation of magnetic order
from the cubic to the face diagonal.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The microscopic calculations for α−RuCl3 empha-
sized the importance of oﬀ-diagonal nearest neighbor
Γ interactions.25 The eﬀect of adding Γ interaction to
the nearest neighbor Kitaev-Heisenberg model is eas-
iest to understand in the rotated reference frame of
the four-sublattice Klein transformation.27,44 The Kitaev
and Heisenberg interactions do not change their form and
only change the value of the coupling constants under this
transformation. On the other hand, Γ-interaction picks
up a bond dependent sign as shown in Fig. 1(e). In fact,
Γ changes the sign on half of the bonds, i.e. there are just
as many negative bonds as there are positive bonds for
each Kitaev type of bonds. Since the Klein transformed
version of the zigzag state is the AFM N´eel state, all the
bonds are AFM and involve the same pair of spins. Thus
the contribution of the Γ interaction to the mean-ﬁeld en-
ergy cancels out, and the set of states remains degenerate.
This means that as long as we remain in the small win-
dow where Γ does not destabilize the zigzag order found
by Rau et al.,26 we can perform our order-by-disorder
approach to see what state is chosen.
Fig. 5 shows the ﬂuctuation free energy computed for
the J − K − Γ model for the set of parameters, J1 = −2.9
meV and K1 = 8.1 meV, suggested by Banerjee et al.17
In Fig. 5 (a), Γ = 0.7 meV, and the minima of the
ﬂuctuational free energy are still along cubic directions.

In this paper we explored how the direction of the mag-
netic moments in the zigzag ground state order is chosen
in Na2IrO3 and α−RuCl3. In both compounds, the Ki-
taev interaction plays an important role. For the case of
FM nearest neighbor Kitaev interaction, like in Na2IrO3,
farther neighbor interactions are essential for stabilizing
the zigzag ground state. For the AFM nearest neigh-
bor Kitaev interaction, which was widely suggested to
be the dominant interaction in α−RuCl3,14,16–18,25 the
zigzag order can be stabilized already within the nearest
neighbor model.
We proposed that the J1−K1−J2−K2−J3−Γ model
can explain all the experimental ﬁnding in Na2IrO3.
In this model the selection of the experimentally ob-
served face diagonal direction of the order parameter hap-
pens already on the mean-ﬁeld level due to small bond-
dependent anisotropic term Γ.
In α−RuCl3, if the the nearest neighbor Kitaev inter-
action is AFM, the original Kitaev-Heisenberg model20
is suﬃcient to explain both the collinear zigzag ground
state and cubic directions of the order parameter. We
studied the eﬀect of the Γ-term and showed that while
on the mean-ﬁeld level it doesn’t eﬀect the ground state
degeneracy, it favors non-collinear 3-Q states, instead of
the experimentally observed zigzag state with spins along
cubic axes, once the Gaussian ﬂuctuations are included.

FIG. 5: (Color online) Fluctuational corrections to the free energy in the nearest neighbor Kitaev Heisenberg model with Γ
interaction. We used the following parameters: J = −2.9 meV, K = 8.1 meV and (a) Γ = 0.7 meV, (a) Γ = 0.8 meV, and (a)
Γ = 0.9 meV. The minima of the free energy are shown by deep blue color and the maxima but intense red color.

Thus, it appears to be an upper bound for Γ-term, which
can be estimated for a given set of nearest neighbor pa-
rameters.

After the completion of our paper, we became aware of
an independent study by Winter et al.40 of magnetic in-
teractions in the Kitaev materials Na2IrO3 and α−RuCl3
In this work, the authors treated all interactions up to
third neighbours on equal footing by combining exact di-
agonalization and ab-initio techniques. One of the main
ﬁndings of this work is that the third neighbor Heisen-
berg interaction is important in all Kitaev materials.

Let us brieﬂy compare the results of Ref.40 with our
ﬁndings. The conclusions of the authors of Ref.40 about
the ordering in Na2IrO3 are in agreement with our ﬁnd-
ings, despite the fact that their estimates for K2 sug-
gest signiﬁcantly smaller values than the ones that we
obtained by including only the dominant superexchange
processes between second neighbors. The agreement
holds because the second neighbor Kitaev interaction K2
and the third neighbor interaction J3 favor the same type
of AFM zigzag ground state.

For α−RuCl3, the authors of Ref.40 suggest (i) that
there may be possible variations of in-plane interactions
due to lattice distortions, and (ii) that the nearest neigh-
bor Kitaev interaction may be FM and the third neigh-
bor coupling J3 may be large and AFM. If this is indeed
the case, the physics of α−RuCl3 is similar to that of
Na2IrO3. This, however, still needs to be veriﬁed by a
detailed comparison with the experimental data.

Appendix A: The classical degeneracy of the

extended Kitaev-Heisenberg model

In this Appendix we provide detailed discussion of the
classical degeneracy of the extended Kitaev-Heisenberg
model at parameters for which either the stripy or the
zigzag AF phases are realized as a ground state and the
manifold of classically degenerate states is rather com-
plex.

To be speciﬁc, let us ﬁrst consider the stripy phase.
It contains six inequivalent collinear stripy states with
FM bonds along either Kitaev x−, y− or z−bonds. It
also contains inﬁnite number of non-collinear (coplanar
and non-coplanar) states. The spin order in the x−, y−
or z− stripy states can be described either with a help
√
of four magnetic sublattices or by a simple spiral char-
√
acterized by a single-Q wave vector: Qx = (π/
3, π),
Qy = (π/
3, 0). One of the
stripy states with FM z-bonds is shown in Fig.1 (c). In
each of these stripy states the spins are aligned along one
of the cubic directions which is locked to the spatial ori-
entation of a stripy pattern by the Kitaev interaction,
i.e. the direction of the order parameter is deﬁned by the
wave vector Q = Qx, Qy or Qz determining the breaking
of the translation symmetry.

√
3,−π) and Qz = (−2π/

The structure of the manifold of the non-collinear
states, which looks rather complex in the original model,
can be easily understood with the help of the four-
sublattice transformation (see Fig.1 (e) ) based on the
Klein duality.19,27,44 In the new rotated basis, the stripy
phase is mapped to the FM order with a unique ordering
vector Q = 0. Classically, all states with arbitrary direc-
tion of the FM order have the same energy. FM states
with order parameter along the cubic axes give the six
stripy phases in the unrotated spin basis discussed above.
Arbitrary directions of the FM order parameter lead to
a set of non-coplanar states in which each component of
spin, Sx, Sy, and Sz, transforms with its own Qx, Qy

and Qz wavevector, which coincide with the Q vectors
describing the spatial orientation of the stripes in the
respective collinear states.

Using these three ordering vectors, we can write the

non-coplanar phase of the unrotated spins as

Si,0 = (sθcφ eıQx·Ri, sθsφ eıQy·Ri, cθ eıQz·Ri ),

(A1)

where θ and φ are the polar and azimuthal angles of
the FM order parameter. Si,0 denote the spins on the
sublattice 0 and the spins on the sublattice 1 are obtained
from Si,0 by a constant phase shift coming from the spin
rotation on that bond as prescribed by the four sublattice
transformation. As in Fig.1 (c), the sublattices 0 and 1
are connected by z bond, the order of the spins on the
subllatice 1 is given by

Si,1 = (Sx

i,0 eıπ, Sy

i,0 eıπ, Sz

i,0)

(A2)

In the zigzag phase, the structure of the classical states
manifold is very similar to the stripy phase. The four-
sublattice transformation maps the zigzag phase onto the
N´eel AF phase. The generic state is again described by
the three-Q spiral state. The only diﬀerence is that the
spins on sublattice 1 have an overall phase factor of π,
Si,1 = (Sx

i,0eıπ).

Appendix B: The matrix elements Aq,νν(cid:48) computed

for the KH model.

The matrix elements Aq,νν(cid:48) can be written as

where a repeated index implies a summation over. The
ﬁrst term in (B1) is the contribution from the interac-
tion term and the second term is from the constraint
term.31,32 For convenience, the constraint matrix ˆCq can
be ﬁrst written in the original basis, in which the inter-
action term is not diagonal, and then transformed to the
eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian with a help of the unitary
transformation Uq. In the original basis the constraint
matrix ˆCq consists of two blocks, one for each sublat-
tice. The A-sublattice block has elements Cq,µ,µ(cid:48) with
µ, µ(cid:48) = 1, 2, 3 and the B-sublattice block has the elements
with µ, µ(cid:48) = 4, 5, 6. The two blocks are identical, so ˆCq
takes the following form:

39 In Ref.22 we obtained large K2 interaction by considering
only dominant super-exchange processes between second
neighbors. The authors of recent study40 claim that the
second neighbor Kitaev interaction might be suppressed
due to the interference of the various second and third
order hopping processes, which we did not include in our
derivation. However, as it is discussed in the text, the com-
bined eﬀect of K2 and J3 interactions leads to the same
physics.
