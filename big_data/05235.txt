CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED

SCALAR CURVATURE

RICHARD H BAMLER

Abstract. In this paper we prove convergence and compactness results for
Ricci ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature and entropy. More speciﬁcally, we
show that Ricci ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature converge smoothly away
from a singular set of codimension ≥ 4. We also establish a general form of
the Hamilton-Tian Conjecture, which is even true in the Riemannian case.
These results are based on a compactness theorem for Ricci ﬂows with
bounded scalar curvature, which states that any sequence of such Ricci ﬂows
converges, after passing to a subsequence, to a metric space that is smooth
away from a set of codimension ≥ 4. In the course of the proof, we will also
establish Lp<2-curvature bounds on time-slices of such ﬂows.

1. Introduction and statement of the main results

1.1. Introduction. In this paper, we analyze Ricci ﬂows (gt)t∈[0,T ),

∂tgt = −2 Ricgt,

as introduced by Hamilton (cf [Ham82]). An important goal in the study of
Ricci ﬂows is to characterize the formation process of ﬁnite-time singularities. In
dimensions 2 and 3, this process is reasonably well understood. In these dimen-
sions, the scalar curvature blows up at a singular time (cf [Ham82, Ham95]) and
the singularities can be characterized after normalizing the scalar curvature by
parabolic rescaling. In other words, the singularity formation can be understood
at the (local) scale of the scalar curvature. In dimension 2, Hamilton and Chow
showed (see [Ham88, Cho91]) that ﬁnite-time singularities can only occur on the
sphere or the projective plane and, after normalizing the scalar curvature, the
ﬂow converges to a round metric. In dimension 3, Perelman proved (see [Per02])
that, at the scale of the scalar curvature, singularities can be modeled by so-called
κ-solutions. These κ-solutions can be classiﬁed in a qualitative way.

In higher dimensions, the characterization and classiﬁcation of ﬁnite-time sin-
gularities is still completely open. An intermediate goal towards this charac-
terization is to understand the behavior of Ricci ﬂows at the scale of the scalar
curvature. To be more speciﬁc, one would like to understand the behavior of Ricci
ﬂows (gt)t∈[0,T ) on a compact manifold M for which the scalar curvature satisﬁes
certain upper bounds. Such Ricci ﬂows have recently been subject to increased
interest (see for example [TZ13b, TZ13a, CW12, CW14, BZ15a, BZ15b, Sim15b,
Sim15a]).

The following two questions are central to this ﬁeld of study:

Question 1. Suppose that the scalar curvature satisﬁes the bound R < C on
M × [0, T ) for some constant C < ∞. What can be said about the behavior of the
metric gt as t ր T ?
Question 2. Suppose that there is some constant C < ∞ such that the scalar
curvature satisﬁes R(·, t) < C(T − t)−1 and the diameter satisﬁes diamt M <
C(T − t)1/2 for all t ∈ [0, T ). What can be said about the behavior of the rescaled
metric (T − t)−1gt as t ր T ?

Note that by the weak maximum principle applied to the evolution equation

of the scalar curvature,

∂tR = △R + 2|Ric|2 ≥ △R +
we automatically have R > −C0 for some C0 < ∞.

One may conjecture that the answer to Question 1 is that gt converges to a
smooth metric gT as t ր T and hence that the ﬂow (gt)t∈[0,T ) can be extended
past time T . In other words, one may hope that if a Ricci ﬂow (gt)t∈[0,T ) develops
a ﬁnite-time singularity at time T , then the scalar curvature must become un-
bounded. This conjecture is true in dimensions n = 2, 3, as pointed out earlier,
and in the case in which (gt)t∈[0,T ) is a K¨ahler-Ricci ﬂow (see [Zha10]). More-
over, if we replace the assumption that R < C on M × [0, T ) by the stronger
assumption that |Ric| < C < ∞ on M × [0, T ), then Question 1 can be answered
aﬃrmatively (see [ˇSeˇs05]).
In
this dimension, it has, however, recently been proven that the L2-norm of the

Even in dimension 4, an exact answer to Question 1 is still unknown.

Riemannian curvature tensor, ´M |Rm|2dgt, remains uniformly bounded as t ր T
and that the metric gt converges to a C 0-orbifold (see [BZ15a, Sim15b, Sim15a]).
The techniques used to obtain these results are very speciﬁc to dimension 4 and
cannot be generalized to higher dimension. It was moreover shown in [Sim15a]
that in dimension 4, despite possible singularities, the ﬂow (gt)t∈[0,T ) can still be
extended past time T by a Ricci ﬂow on the limiting orbifold. In other words, the
ﬂow can be continued if we allow the underlying manifold to change its topology.
This insight raises the question of whether a similar behavior can be observed
in higher dimensions. So one may wonder whether in the context of Question 1,
the time-slices (M, gt) degenerate to a possibly singular limit (M∞, gT ) that is
“regular enough” such that gT can be evolved into a Ricci ﬂow which lives on the
singular space M∞.

The setting of Question 2 occurs naturally in the study of K¨ahler-Ricci ﬂows
on Fano manifolds (see [ST08]). By the recent resolution of the Yau-Tian-
Donaldson Conjecture (see [CDS15a, CDS15b, CDS15c, Tia15]), Fano manifolds
admit K¨ahler-Einstein metrics under certain algebro-geometric conditions.
If
these conditions are fulﬁlled, then the rescaled metric (T − t)−1gt smoothly con-
verges to one of the predicted K¨ahler-Einstein metrics as t ր T (see [TZ13c]). If
these conditions are not assumed, then we have the following conjecture:

Hamilton-Tian Conjecture. If (gt)t∈[0,T ) is a K¨ahler-Ricci ﬂow on a Fano
manifold M, then (T − t)−1gt subsequentially converges to a K¨ahler-Ricci soliton,
possibly away from a singular set of codimension ≥ 4 as t ր T .

Progress towards the Hamilton-Tian Conjecture has been made in [TZ13b],
[TZ13a] and [CW14]. The approach in [CW14] uses the Bergman kernel in a
crucial way, which is only available in the K¨ahler setting. This technique is non-
standard in proving compactness of geometric equations and very diﬀerent from
the techniques used in this paper.

In the present paper we will ﬁnd answers to Questions 1 and 2. The answer
to Question 2, restricted to the K¨ahler case, will then imply the Hamilton-Tian
Conjecture. Our proof is purely Riemannian and does not require any tools from
K¨ahler geometry.

1.2. Statement of the main results. In the setting of Question 1, the author
showed previously in collaboration with Qi Zhang (see [BZ15b]) that the induced
: M × M → [0,∞) converges uniformly to a pseudometric
length metric dt
dT : M × M → [0,∞) as t ր T , which is a metric with the exception that the
distance between some distinct points is allowed to be zero. The ﬁrst main result
of this paper is that this convergence is in fact smooth away from a small set of
Minkowski dimension ≤ n − 4:
Theorem 1.1 (evolution of the ﬂow under a uniform scalar curvature bound).
Suppose that R < C on M × [0, T ) for some C < ∞ and let dT : M × M → [0,∞)
be the limiting pseudometric on M.
Then there is an open subset R ⊂ M on which the metric gt smoothly converges
to a smooth Riemannian metric gT . The complement of this subset, M \ R,
has Minkowski dimension ≤ n − 4 with respect to dT . Moreover, the induced
metric space (M/ ∼, dT ) is isometric to the completion of the length metric of
the (incomplete) Riemannian manifold (R, gT ).

Similarly, in the setting of Question 2, we obtain smooth subconvergence of

the rescaled ﬂow to a singular gradient shrinking Ricci soliton:

Theorem 1.2 (degeneration towards a singular gradient shrinking soliton). As-
sume that for some constant C < ∞ we have

for all t ∈ [0, T ). Then for any sequence of times ti ր T and points qi ∈ M we
can choose a subsequence such that (M, (T − ti)−1gti, qi) converges to a pointed,
singular space (X , q∞) = (X, d,R, g, q∞) that has singularities of codimension 4 in
the sense of Deﬁnition 2.2 (this implies that the singular set X\R has Minkowski
dimension ≤ n− 4) and that is Y -regular at scale 1 in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.4
for some Y < ∞ which only depends on g0 and C.
Moreover, X is a shrinking gradient soliton in the following sense: There is
a smooth and bounded function f∞ ∈ C∞(R) that satisﬁes the shrinking soliton
equation

Ricg +∇2f∞ = 1
2g

on

R.

A precise deﬁnition of a singular space X can be found in subsection 2.1 (see
Deﬁnition 2.1). In a nutshell, a singular space is a metric space whose geometry
is given by a smooth Riemannian metric on a generic subset. The notion of
“convergence to a singular space” is also made more concrete in subsection 2.1
(see Deﬁnition 2.5).

In the K¨ahler-Fano case, Theorem 1.2 implies the Hamilton-Tian Conjecture:
Corollary 1.3. Let (M 2n, (gt)t∈[0,T )) be a K¨ahler-Ricci ﬂow on a Fano manifold
M 2n. Then for any sequence of times ti ր T we can ﬁnd a subsequence such
that (M, (T − ti)−1gti) converges to a singular space X = (X, d,R, g) that has
singularities of codimension 4, that is Y -regular at scale 1 for some Y < ∞ and
that is a shrinking soliton in the sense of Theorem 1.2.

1.3. Further results. Theorems 1.1, 1.2, and by proxy, Corollary 1.3 will follow
from a unifying compactness result for sequences of Ricci ﬂows with bounded
scalar curvature. This compactness result states that for any sequence of Ricci
ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature and uniformly bounded entropy, the ﬁnal
time-slices subconverge to a singular space, which is smooth away from a set of
Minkowski dimension ≤ n − 4.
Theorem 1.4 (compactness of Ricci ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature). Let
(Mi, (gi
t)t∈[−2,0]) be a sequence of Ricci ﬂows on compact, n-dimensional manifolds
Mi and assume that there is a uniform constant C < ∞ such that the following
holds:

(i) The scalar curvature satisﬁes the uniform bound

|R| < ρi < C

for some sequence ρi.

(For a deﬁnition of µ[gi

Let qi ∈ Mi be a sequence of basepoints. Then, after passing to a subsequence,
there is an n-dimensional, pointed singular space (X , q∞) (in the sense of Def-
inition 2.1) such that the sequence of pointed Riemannian manifolds (Mi, gi
0, qi)
converges to (X , q∞) (in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.5). Moreover, the singular
space X has singularities of codimension 4 (in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.2) and
X is Y -regular at scale 1 for some Y = Y (n, C) < ∞, which only depends on n
and C. Lastly, if ρi → 0, then X is Ricci ﬂat (in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.1) and
has mild singularities (in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.3).

We mention at this point that, using the techniques developed in this paper, it is
possible to characterize tangent cones of the singular limit spaces in Theorem 1.4
and show that these tangent cones are in fact metric cones. This result will be
explained in a subsequent paper.

Theorem 1.4 can be seen as a ﬁrst structure theory for Ricci ﬂows and it
generalizes the structure theory of Einstein metrics developed by Cheeger and
Naber (see [CN13, CN15]). It is to be expected that this structure theory for
Ricci ﬂows can be generalized further and the uniform scalar curvature bound
can be replaced by a weaker assumption, such as an Lp-bound on the scalar
curvature or a non-collapsing condition.

Theorem 1.4 and its proof implies an important geometric bound for Ricci ﬂows
with bounded scalar curvature. Before introducing this bound, we need to recall
the following terminology:

Deﬁnition 1.5 (curvature radius). Let (M, g) be a (not necessarily complete)
Riemannian manifold and let x ∈ M be a point. Then we deﬁne the curvature
radius rRm(x) at x to be the supremum over all r > 0 such that the ball B(x, r)
is relatively compact in M and such that |Rm| < r−2 on B(x, r).

6

rRm(x) with respect to the metric gt.

If (gt)t∈I is a Ricci ﬂow on M, then we denote by rRm(x, t) the curvature radius
We will often denote by {a < rRm < b} (in the static case) or {a < rRm(·, t) <
b} (in the dynamic case) the set of all points x ∈ M such that a < rRm(x) < b or
a < rRm(x, t) < b, respectively.

In the next result, we control the inverse of the curvature radius, (rRm(·, t))−1,
in the local Lp<4 sense on each time-slice of a Ricci ﬂow, in terms of a constant
that only depends on an upper bound on the scalar curvature and a lower bound
on the entropy. We furthermore obtain Lp<2-bounds on the Riemannian curvature
tensor.
Theorem 1.6 (bounds on the curvature radius). For any A < ∞, ε > 0 and n
there is an C = C(A, ε, n) < ∞ such that the following holds:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact n-dimensional manifold such
that the following holds:

(i) The scalar curvature satisﬁes the uniform upper bound

(ii) Perelman’s entropy satisﬁes the uniform lower bound

R < A

on

M × [−2, 0].

µ[g−2, τ ] > −A.
Then for any 0 < r < 1, t ∈ [−1, 0] and x ∈ M we have

ν[g−2, 4] = inf
0<τ≤4

ˆB(x,t,r) |Rm(·, t)|2−εdgt ≤ ˆB(x,t,r)(cid:0)rRm(·, t)(cid:1)−4+2εdgt < Crn−4+2ε.

Note that Theorem 1.6 can be seen as a generalization of the main result of

[CN15].

Lastly, we mention that the size of the time-interval [−2, 0] in Theorem 1.6 was
chosen for technical reasons and can be adjusted to any other size via parabolic
rescaling (see subsection 2.1 for more details). Likewise, the interval [−1, 0] in the
assertion of Theorem 1.6 can be chosen to be larger than half of the time-interval
[−2, 0].
1.4. Outline of the proof. In the following we give a brief outline of the proofs
of our main results. As mentioned before, Theorems 1.1, 1.2 and Corollary 1.3
are deduced as a consequence of the compactness result, Theorem 1.4. This com-
pactness result and the curvature bound, Theorem 1.6, will be proven virtually
simultaneously.

Before explaining the strategy of proof of Theorems 1.4 and 1.6, we ﬁrst make
the following observation: In order to obtain the (strong) Lp<4-bound in Theo-
rem 1.6, it suﬃces to establish a weak Lp′<4-bound for some p < p′ < 4. For
technical convenience, we will often work with this weak Lp′
-bound in this paper.
As there is no deeper reason for our preferred usage of the weak Lp-bounds, we
will neglect this aspect in the following outline and refer to a weak Lp-bound
simply as an “Lp-bound”.

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

7

The general strategy of our proof is the following: We ﬁrst introduce an a priori
assumption, which states that the inverse of the curvature radius, (rRm(·, t))−1,
is locally is bounded by some constant E < ∞ in the Lp-sense, similarly as in
the statement of Theorem 1.6. Here 3 < p < 4; it suﬃces choose p = 3.1.
Choose moreover p < p′ < 4 for future purposes. As a ﬁrst step we will de-
rive our compactness result, Theorem 1.4, under this additional a priori bound.
More speciﬁcally, we will show that the ﬁnal time slices of any pointed sequence
(Mi, (gi
t)t∈[−2,0], qi) of Ricci ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature and entropy sub-
converges to a singular space X if those ﬂows (Mi, (gi
t)t∈[−2,0]) satisfy the uniform
a priori Lp-curvature assumption involving the constant E, as chosen earlier. If
we assume furthermore that the scalar curvature of the ﬂows (Mi, (gi
t)t∈[−2,0]) is
not only uniformly bounded, but also converges to 0 uniformly (i.e.
the case
ρi → 0), then we will ﬁnd that the limiting singular space X is Ricci ﬂat. In
other words, blowups of Ricci ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature are Ricci ﬂat
singular spaces under our a priori assumption.

We can now use the results of [Bam16], where the theory of Cheeger, Colding
and Naber (see [Col97, CC96, CN13, CN15]) is adapted to the singular setting.
These results give us a universal Lp′
-bound C1 < ∞ for (rXRm(·))−1 on such (Ricci
ﬂat) blowups X . Here the bound C1 can be chosen independently of the constant
E, appearing in our a priori Lp-curvature assumption. Via a covering argument,
we can then pass from the limit X to the sequence (Mi, (gi
t)t∈[−2,0], qi) and conclude
that a similar bound holds on the Ricci ﬂows. That is, we can ﬁnd a universal
constant C2 < ∞, which is also independent of E, such that any Ricci ﬂow that
satisﬁes the a priori Lp-bound on (rRm(·, t))−1, involving the constant E, also
satisﬁes the same type of Lp-curvature bound with E replaced by C2, as long as
the scalar curvature is small enough (depending on E).

As C2 was chosen independently of E, it is now possible to ﬁx E ≫ C2. This
choice will allow us to draw the following conclusion, after parabolic rescaling:
There is a universal constant r0 > 0 (which may depend on E) such that if
a Ricci ﬂow with bounded scalar curvature satisﬁes the a priori Lp-curvature
assumption at scales less than r for some 0 < r < r0, then it also satisﬁes this
assumption at scales less than 2r. Since any Ricci ﬂow satisﬁes the a priori
assumption at scales less than r for some small 0 < r < r0, we will ﬁnd by
induction that it satisﬁes the a priori assumption at all scales less than some
universal r0. Via a covering argument, we will obtain similar Lp-bounds at larger
scales, thus implying Theorem 1.6. As a consequence, we can remove the a priori
assumption that we had to impose earlier for the compactness result, Theorem 1.4.
Moreover, the curvature bound, Theorem 1.6, follows immediately.

The most crucial part of our argument is the proof of the compactness result,
Theorem 1.4 under the additional a priori Lp-curvature assumption. For this
purpose, we invoke the compactness result of [Bam16], which holds for sequences
of general Riemannian manifolds that satisfy certain uniform geometric bounds.
While some of these geometric bounds follow more or less naturally from our
scalar curvature and entropy bounds and the a priori assumption, there are two

8

properties in particular whose veriﬁcation turns out to be highly non-trivial: The
ﬁrst property will imply that the limiting singular space X has “mild singularities”
(see Deﬁnition 2.3), which roughly means that almost every pair of regular points
in X can be connected by a regular minimizing geodesic. The second property is
an ε-regularity property, which allows us to obtain curvature bounds at centers
of balls in X whose volume is almost Euclidean. Both properties are essential
ingredients in [Bam16] for the derivation of the Lp-curvature bounds on X . The
main innovation of this paper lies in showing that these properties hold for ﬁnal
time-slices of the Ricci ﬂows under consideration. Our proofs of these properties
are based on several new L-geometric arguments and the estimates from [BZ15a]
and [BZ15b], which were recently developed by the author and Qi Zhang.
Another aspect of our proof is that we only obtain the Ricci ﬂatness of the
blowup limits on the regular part of the limit, where the geometry can be de-
scribed in terms of a smooth Riemannian metric. We don’t obtain a (synthetic)
curvature characterization on the singular part of the limit. Therefore, the adap-
tation of the theory of Cheeger, Colding and Naber to the singular setting more
subtle. This aspect is analyzed in detail in [Bam16].

The general inductive multi-scale approach of our proof is quite common in the
analysis of geometric PDEs and Ricci ﬂows in particular. The eﬀectiveness of this
approach in Ricci ﬂows was ﬁrst demonstrated by Perelman (cf [Per02, Per03]).
In the setting of Ricci ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature, the approach was also
used in [BZ15a]. In the K¨ahler case, it was furthermore used by Chen and Wang
(cf [CW14]). However, in their work, the authors needed to impose several strong
additional a priori assumptions that they had to verify subsequently. In our proof,
these additional properties will be derived directly, making the structure of our
argument more linear and transparent.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains the most important deﬁ-
nitions and conventions used in the statement of the main theorems and through-
out this paper.

In section 3, we review the results from [BZ15a] and [BZ15b] that will be needed

subsequently.

In section 4, we prove a result similar to the compactness statement of Theo-
rem 1.4 under the a prior Lp-bound on (rRm(·, t))−1, using the results of [Bam16].
The main part of this section is devoted to the proof of a condition of [Bam16],
which leads to the mildness of the singularities of the limiting space.

In section 5 we show that the limiting space from the previous section is Y -
regular (in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.4), meaning that balls with Y −1-almost max-
imal volume have bounded curvature at their center. Here the constant Y only
depends on a lower bound of the entropy of the ﬂow and not on the constant
E from the a priori assumptions, a fact which is important to avoid circular
arguments in our inductive multi-scale argument.

In section 6, we combine the compactness statement under the extra curvature
assumptions (from section 4) with the Y -regularity of the limit X (from section 5)
and its Lp bound on (rRm(·, t))−1 (from [Bam16]) to deduce the main Theorems 1.4

and 1.6. From these results, Theorems 1.1, 1.2 and Corollary 1.3 will follow
immediately.

2. Important terminology and conventions

2.1. Terminology. We now give a precise deﬁnition of the terminology that was
used in the theorems of corollaries of the previous subsection and which will be
used throughout this paper. Let us ﬁrst introduce the following notion: Given
a measurable subset S ⊂ M of a Riemannian manifold (M, g) we will denote by
|S| = |S|g the Riemannian measure of S with respect to the metric g. If (gt)t∈M
is a Ricci ﬂow, then we often write |S|t := |S|gt.
Next, we review Perelman’s entropy formulas (cf [Per02]). For any compact,
n-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M, g), any function C 1(M) and any τ > 0
we deﬁne

W[g, f, τ ] := ˆM(cid:0)τ (|∇f|2 + R) + f − n(cid:1)(4πτ )−n/2e−f dg.

We can then derive the following functionals: For τ > 0, we deﬁne

µ[g, τ ] :=

and

inf

f∈C1(M )

´M (4πτ )−n/2e−f dg=1

W[g, f, τ ]

ν[g, τ ] := inf

0<τ ′<τ

µ[g, τ′].

Note that ν[g, τ ] ≤ 0. If (gt)t∈[0,τ ) is a Ricci ﬂow, then the functions t 7→ µ[gt, τ−t],
t 7→ ν[gt, τ − t] and t 7→ ν[gt] are non-decreasing. Moreover, by replacing f ←
f − n
2 log τ2, we can deduce the following estimate for any 0 < τ1 ≤ τ2:

2 log τ1 + n

log τ1 −

µ[g, τ2] ≥ µ[g, τ1] +

and similarly

ν[g, τ1] ≥ ν[g, τ2] ≥ ν[g, τ1] +

n

log τ1 −

n
2

log τ2.

Lastly, note that the choice τ = 4 in the conditions on the entropy in the theorems
and corollaries of subsection 1.1 only serves our convenience and can be modiﬁed
to any other constant.

We now deﬁne what we mean by the singular spaces that appeared in Theo-
rem 1.4. The following deﬁnition comprises the most basic notions of a metric
space that is smooth on a generic subset.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (singular space). A tuple X = (X, d,R, g) is called an (n-
dimensional) singular space if the following holds:

(1) (X, d) is a locally compact, complete metric length space.
(2) R ⊂ X is an open and dense subset that is equipped with the structure of
a diﬀerentiable n-manifold whose topology is equal to the topology induced
by X.

(3) g is a smooth Riemannian metric on R.

10

RICHARD H BAMLER

(4) The length metric of (R, g) is equal to the restriction of d to R. In other
(5) There are constants 0 < κ1 < κ2 < ∞ such that for all 0 < r < 1

words, (X, d) is the completion of the length metric on (R, g).

κ1rn < |B(x, r) ∩ R| < κ2rn.

Here | · | denotes the Riemannian volume with respect to the metric g and
distance balls B(x, r) are measured with respect to the metric d.

If moreover Ricg = 0 everywhere on R, then X is said to be Ricci ﬂat. Also, if
q ∈ X is a point, then the tuple (X , q) or (X, d,R, g, q) is called pointed singular
space.
The subset R is called the regular part of X and its complement X \ R the

singular part of X .

We remark that this deﬁnition is similar to the corresponding deﬁnition in
[Bam16] with the only diﬀerence that g is assumed to be smooth in this paper.
We furthermore emphasize that a the metric d on X is induced by the length
metric of the Riemannian metric g on R (see item (4)). So the distance between
any two points in R can be approximated arbitrarily well by the length of a
smooth connecting curve in R. This is an important property, which will take us
some eﬀort to establish.
We can generalize the concept of curvature radius from Deﬁnition 1.5 to singu-
lar spaces X = (X, d,R, g) by deﬁning the function rRm : X → [0,∞] as follows:
we deﬁne rRm|X\R ≡ 0 and for any x ∈ R we let rRm(x) be the supremum over
all r > 0 such that B(x, r) ⊂ R and |Rm| < r−2 on B(x, r).

We will now deﬁne the following properties of singular spaces:

Deﬁnition 2.2 (singularities of codimension p0). A singular space X = (X, d,
R, g) is said to have singularities of codimension p0, for some p0 > 0, if for any
0 < p < p0, x ∈ X and r0 > 0 there is an Ep,x,r0 < ∞ (which may depend on
X ) such that the following holds: For any 0 < r < r0 and 0 < s < 1 we have

|{rRm < sr} ∩ B(x, r) ∩ R| ≤ Ep,x,rsprn.

It can be seen easily that if an n-dimensional singular space X has singularities
of codimension p0 in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.2, then its singular set X \ R has
Minkowski dimension ≤ n − p0.
Deﬁnition 2.3 (mild singularities). A singular space X = (X, d,R, g) is said
to have mild singularities if for any p ∈ X there is a closed subset Qp ⊂ R of
measure zero such that for any x ∈ R\ Qp there is a minimizing geodesic between
p and x that lies in R.

The idea behind the notion of mild singularities also occurs in the work of
Cheeger and Colding (see [CC00, Theorem 3.9] and Chen and Wang (see [CW14,
Deﬁnition 2.1]).
Deﬁnition 2.4 (Y -regularity). A singular space X is called Y -regular at scales
less than a, for some a, Y > 0, if for any p ∈ X and 0 < r < a the following

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

11

holds: If

|B(p, r) ∩ R| > (ωn − Y −1)rn,

then p ∈ R and rRm(y) > Y −1r. Here ωn denotes the volume of the standard
n-dimensional ball in Euclidean space. The space X is said to be Y -regular at all
scales, if it is Y -regular at scale a for all a > 0.

The notion of Y -regularity is standard in the study of Einstein metrics. A
similar notion has been used in [CC00] and [And89] and, in the setting of Ricci
ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature, in [CW14, Deﬁnition 3.3] and [TZ13a, The-
orem 2.35]. We also remark that Deﬁnitions 2.2 and 2.4 are similar to the cor-
responding deﬁnitions in [Bam16] with the only diﬀerence that the curvature
radius, as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1.5, that is used in these deﬁnitions here does not
involve higher derivatives of the curvature tensor. Due to parabolic regularity
and backwards pseudolocality (see Proposition 3.2), this diﬀerence will turn out
to be inessential.

It can be shown that in a Y -regular space with singularities of codimension p0
(for some p0 > 0), any point p ∈ X whose tangent cone is isometric to Rn, is
actually contained in R. Therefore, the regular set R and the metric g in such a
space is uniquely characterized by the metric d.
Next, we deﬁne what we understand by convergence towards a singular space.

Deﬁnition 2.5 (convergence and convergence scheme). Consider a sequence
(Mi, gi, qi) of pointed n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and a pointed, n-
dimensional singular space (X , q∞) = (X, d,R, g, q∞). Let Ui ⊂ R and Vi ⊂ Mi
be open subsets and Φi : Ui → Vi be (bijective) diﬀeomorphisms such that the
following holds:
(1) U1 ⊂ U2 ⊂ . . .
(2) S∞i=1 Ui = R.
(3) For any open and relatively compact W ⊂ R and any m ≥ 1 we have
(4) There exists a sequence q∗i ∈ Ui such that
dMi(Φi(q∗i ), qi) → 0.

Φ∗i gi → g on W in the C m-sense.

(5) For any R < ∞ and ε > 0 there is an iR,ε < ∞ such that for all i > iR,ε

and x, y ∈ BX (q∞, R) ∩ Ui we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)dMi(Φi(x), Φi(y)) − dX (x, y)(cid:12)(cid:12) < ε

and such that for any i > iR,ε and x ∈ BMi(qi, R) there is a y ∈ Vi such
that dMi(x, y) < ε.

Then the sequence {(Ui, Vi, Φi)}∞i=1 is called a convergence scheme for the se-
quence of pointed Riemannian manifolds (Mi, gi, qi) and the pointed singular
space (X , q∞). We say that (Mi, gi, qi) converges to (X , q∞) if such a conver-
gence scheme exists.

2.2. Conventions. In the following we will ﬁx a dimension n ≥ 3 and we will
omit the dependence of our constants on n. Note that all the theorems above
trivially hold in dimension 2.

3. Preliminaries on Ricci flows

3.1. Ricci ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature. In this subsection we re-
view some of the previous results on Ricci ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature
that we will need in the following.

We ﬁrst recall the following volume bounds for distance balls.

Proposition 3.1 (volume bound). For any A < ∞ there is a constant C =
C(A) < ∞ such that the following holds:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold that
satisﬁes

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ A on M × [−2, 0].

Then for any (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and r > 0 we have

C−1(cid:0) min{1, r}(cid:1)n ≤ |B(x, t, r)|t ≤ CrneCr.

The lower volume bound is due to Perelman’s No Local Collapsing Theorem
(cf [Per02]) and the upper bound is a consequence of the non-inﬂating property
from [Zha12] or [CW13], see also [BZ15b, Lemma 2.1].

Second, we recall the Backwards and Forward Pseudolocality Theorems for

Ricci ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature.

Proposition 3.2 (Pseudolocality, cf [Per02], [BZ15a, Theorem 1.5]). For any
A < ∞ there is a constant ε = ε(A) > 0 such that the following holds:
satisﬁes:

Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold that

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ A on M × [−2, 0].

on

Then for any (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and r := min{1, rRm(x, t)} we have
P (x, t, εr,−(εr)2) ∪ P (x, t, εr, min{(εr)2,−t}).

rRm > εr
(3.1)
Here, P (x, t, r, a) denotes the parabolic neighborhood B(x, t, r) × [t, t + a] or
B(x, t, r) × [t + a, t], depending on whether a is positive or negative.
Note that the minimum in (3.1) is placed in the second parabolic neighborhood
to ensure that the parabolic neighborhood does not reach past time 0, where the
ﬂow is not deﬁned.

Next, we recall the distance distortion bound from [BZ15b].

Proposition 3.3 (Distance distortion, cf [BZ15b, Theorem 1.1]). For any A, D <
∞ there is a constant C = C(A, D) < ∞ such that the following holds:
satisﬁes

Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold that

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

13

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ A on M × [−2, 0].

Let t1, t2 ∈ [−2, 0] and x, y ∈ M such that dt1(x, y) ≤ D. Then

(cid:12)(cid:12)dt1(x, y) − dt2(x, y)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Cp|t1 − t2|.

We will also need the Gaussian heat kernel bounds from [BZ15a].

Proposition 3.4 (Gaussian heat kernel bounds, cf [BZ15a, Theorem 1.4]). For
any A < ∞ there is a constant C = C(A) < ∞ such that the following holds:
satisﬁes:

Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold that

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ A on M × [−2, 0].

Let K(x, t; y, s) be the fundamental solution of the heat equation coupled with the
Ricci ﬂow and let −2 + A−1 ≤ s < t ≤ 0. Then
t − s (cid:17) < K(x, t; y, s) <

With the help of Proposition 3.3, the time-s distance ds(x, y) can also be replaced
by the time-t distance dt(x, y) in the formula above.

We will sometimes use the following corollary from Propositions 3.1 and 3.4.

Corollary 3.5. For any a > 0 and A < ∞ there is a constant C = C(a, A) < ∞
such that the following holds:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold that

satisﬁes:

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ A on M × [−2, 0].

Let K(x, t; y, s) be the fundamental solution of the heat equation coupled with the
Ricci ﬂow and let −1 ≤ s < t ≤ 0. Then for all r ≥ 0 and x0 ∈ M

ˆM\B(x0,t,r)

Similarly as in Proposition 3.4, the time-t balls B(x0, t, r) can be replaced by the
time-s balls B(x0, s, r) and the time-t measure dgt can be replaced by the time-s
measure dgs and vice versa.

Proof. Set τ := t − s ≤ 1. Let us ﬁrst check (3.2). This inequality holds trivially
for r2 ≤ τ if C is large enough, as its left-hand side is bounded by 1. So assume
that r2 > τ . Then we have, using Propositions 3.1 and 3.4, for some generic
constant C = C(A) < ∞

The bound (3.4) can be derived similarly. This ﬁnishes the proof.
Proposition 3.6. There are constants C0, C1, . . . < ∞, which only depend on the
dimension n such that the following holds: Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on
an n-dimensional manifold . Let (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r < 1 and assume
that the ball B(x, t, r) is relatively compact in M. Assume that |Rm| < r−2 and
|R| ≤ ρ on the parabolic neighborhood P (x, t, r,−r2) for some 0 < ρ < 1. Then
for all m ≥ 0
(3.5)

(cid:3)

|∇m Ric|(x, t) < Cmρ1/2r−m−1

and

|∇R|(x, t) < C0ρ3/4r−1.5

and

|∂t Rm|(x, t) < C0ρ1/2r−3.

(3.6)

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

Proof. For (3.5) see [BZ15a, Lemma 6.1] or [Wan12]. The second bound in (3.6)
can also be found in [BZ15a, Lemma 6.1]. To see the ﬁrst bound in (3.6), use
that |∇2R| ≤ |∇2 Ric| < 2C2ρ1/2r−3 and |R| ≤ ρ in a parabolic neighborhood of
(x, t) and the interpolation inequality at scale ρ1/4r1.5.
3.2. L-geometry. We now recall some of the basic deﬁnitions of L-geometry as
introduced in [Per02].
Let (M, (gt)[a,b]) be a Ricci ﬂow, t0 ∈ (a, b] and 0 ≤ τ1 < τ2 ≤ t0 − a and
consider a smooth curve γ : (τ1, τ2] → M. Then we deﬁne the L-length Lt0(γ)
based at time t0 as

(cid:3)

Lt0(γ) := ˆ τ2

τ1

√τ(cid:0)|γ′(τ )|2

t0−τ + R(γ(τ ), t0 − τ )(cid:1)dτ.

We will often consider the case τ1 = 0. We will also often omit the index t0 if the
base time is clear. For any basepoint (x0, t0) ∈ M × [a, b] and (x, t) ∈ M × [a, t0)
we deﬁne
L(x, t) = L(x0,t0)(x, t) := inf(cid:8)L(γ) : γ : [0, t0−t] → M, γ(0) = x0, γ(t0−t) = x(cid:9).

We also set

L(x, t) = L(x0,t0)(x, t) := 2√t0 − tL(x0,t0)(x, t)

and

l(x, t) = l(x0,t0)(x, t) :=

L(x0,t0)(x, t).

1

2√t0 − t

Critical points γ : [0, τ ] → M of the L-functional are called L-geodescis. An L-
geodesic γ is continuous on [0, τ ] and smooth on (0, τ ] and limτց0 √τ γ′(τ ) ∈ Tx0M
exists. Recall that for any τ > 0 the L-exponential map
L expτ = L exp(x0,t0),τ : Tx0M → M
is deﬁned such that γ(τ ) = L expτ (v) is an L-geodesic with limτց0 √τ γ′(τ ) = v.
The Jacobian of this map, with respect to the measures induced by gt0|x0 on
Tx0M and dgt0−τ on M is denoted by

JL(·, τ ) = JL(x0,t0)(·, τ ) : Tx0M → R.

We call an L-geodesic γ : [0, τ ] → M minimizing if for any other γ∗ : [0, τ ] → M
with γ∗(0) = γ(0) and γ∗(τ ) = γ(τ ) we have L(γ∗) ≥ L(γ). If M is compact, then
it was shown in [Per02] (see also [KL08, sec 17]) that for any (x, t) ∈ M × [a, t0)
there is a minimizing L-geodesic between (x0, t0) and (x, t). We deﬁne similarly
as in the Riemannian case
DLτ = DL(x0,t0),τ :=(cid:8)v ∈ Tx0M : τ′ 7→ L expτ ′(v)

is minimizing on

[0, (1 + λ)τ ]

for some λ > 0(cid:9)

and

GLτ = GL(x0,t0),τ := L exp(x0,t0),τ(cid:0)DL(x0,t0),τ(cid:1).

It was shown by Perelman (cf [Per02]), that DLτ and GLτ are open and that

L expτ : DLτ → GLτ

16

RICHARD H BAMLER

is a diﬀeomorphism and that the complement M \ GLτ has measure zero.
Finally, recall that Perelman showed that along any minimizing geodesic γ :
[0, τ ] → M, γ(τ′) = L expτ ′(v), the quantity τ−n/2e−l(γ(v),t0−τ )JL(v, τ ) is non-
increasing in τ . Therefore, the reduced volume
eV (τ ) = eV(x0,t0)(τ ) := ˆM

(4πτ )−n/2e−l(L expτ (v),−τ )JL(v, τ )dv

is non-increasing in τ as well.

4. Compactness of Ricci flows under a priori assumptions

4.1. Statement of the main result. The goal of this section is to prove a
compactness result for sequences of Ricci ﬂows with bounded scalar curvature
that satisfy an additional a priori uniform Lp-curvature bound. We will show that
such a sequence subconverges towards a singular space. Moreover, if the sequence
is obtained via a blow-up process, then the limiting singular space is Ricci ﬂat and
has certain regularity properties. For example, it has mild singularities and is Y -
tame at all scales, where Y does not depend on the a priori Lp-curvature bound.
This fact will become important in the proof of Theorem 1.6. The regularity
conditions and the Y -tameness property will enable us later to carry out some of
the steps in the theory of Cheeger, Colding and Naber (cf [Col97, CC96, CN13,
CN15]) on the limiting singular space in such a way that the constants involved
in this theory do not depend on the a priori Lp-curvature bound.

The theory of Cheeger, Colding and Naber adapted to the singular setting is
described in [Bam16]. Note that in the following result, we only obtain Ricci ﬂat-
ness of the limiting singular space on their regular part and we won’t characterize
the curvature on the singular part. This will not create any issues for us, as the
results in [Bam16] surprisingly don’t depend on such a curvature characterization.
Lastly, we mention that there is a further regularity property of singular spaces,
namely Y -regularity, whose proof we will postpone to section 5, as it relies on
the compactness result from this section. This Y -regularity property, will then
allow us to carry out all the necessary steps in the theory of Cheeger, Colding
and Naber, as described in [Bam16], in section 6 and deduce Lp-curvature bounds
that are independent of the a priori a priori Lp-curvature bounds.

The main compactness result of this section is the following:

Proposition 4.1 (compactness assuming a priori curvature bounds). Let (Mi,
(gi
t)t∈[−Ti,0]), Ti ≥ 2, be a sequence of Ricci ﬂows on compact, n-dimensional
manifolds Mi such that
(i) ν[gi
(ii) |R| ≤ ρi on Mi × [−Ti, 0] for some sequence 0 < ρi < 1.
(iii) There is a constant p0 > 2 such that for any 0 < p < p0 there is a
constant Ep < ∞ such that for all (x, t) ∈ Mi × [−Ti, 0] and 0 < r, s < 1

−Ti, 2Ti] ≥ −A for some uniform A < ∞.

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

we have

(cid:12)(cid:12){rRm(·, t) < s} ∩ BMi(x, t, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)t ≤ Epsprn.

Let qi ∈ Mi be a sequence of basepoints. Then, after passing to a subsequence,
the pointed Riemannian manifolds (Mi, gi
0, qi) converge (in the sense of Deﬁni-
tion 2.5) to a pointed singular space (X , q∞) = (X, d,R, g, q∞) (in the sense of
Deﬁnition 2.1) with singularities of codimension p0 (in the sense of Deﬁnition
2.2). Moreover:

(a) For all 0 < p < p0 and all x ∈ X and 0 < r, s < 1 we have

(cid:12)(cid:12){r∞Rm < s} ∩ BX(x, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Epsprn.

Here r∞Rm denotes the curvature radius on X .
(b) If ρi → 0, then Ric ≡ 0 on R and X has mild singularities (in the sense
of Deﬁnition 2.3). If furthermore p0 > 1, then X is Y (A)-tame at scales
c(A)√T∞, where T∞ := lim supi→∞ Ti and Y (A, p0) < ∞ can be chosen
only depending on A and p0 and c(A) > 0 can be chosen only depending
on A (in particular, both of these constants are independent of Ep).

0, qi) to (X , q∞) can be understood as follows: there is a

i→∞ (cid:12)(cid:12)BMi(Φi(x), 0, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)0

(d) For any x ∈ R we have

i→∞

rRm(Φi(x), 0).

i→∞ (cid:12)(cid:12)BMi(Φi(x), 0, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)0 ≤(cid:12)(cid:12)BX (x, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12).

(e) For any D < ∞ and σ > 0 and suﬃciently large i (depending on D and

σ) we have

rRm(·, 0) < σ

on

BMi(qi, 0, D) \ Vi

and

r∞Rm < σ

on

BX (q∞, D) \ Ui.

A more eﬀective version of Proposition 4.1 is the following:

Proposition 4.2. For any A, E < ∞ and η > 0 and p0 > 2 there is a ρ =
ρ(A, E, η, p0) > 0 such that the following holds: Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci
ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold M, x0 ∈ M a point and 0 < r0 < 1 a
scale and assume that
(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ ρ on M × [−2, 0].
(iii) For all (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r, s < 1 we have
|{rRm(·, t) < sr} ∩ B(x, t, r)|t ≤ Esp0rn.

18

RICHARD H BAMLER

Then for any (q, t) ∈ M × [−1/2, 0] there is a pointed singular space (X , q∞) =
(X, d,R, g, q∞) with Ric ≡ 0 on R and mild singularities (in the sense of Deﬁ-
nition 2.3), subsets U ⊂ R and V ⊂ M and a diﬀeomorphism Φ : U → V such
that the following holds:

(a) q∞ ∈ U and dt(Φ(q∞), q) < η.
(b) kΦ∗gt − gkC[µ−1](U ) < η.
(c) r∞Rm < η on BX(q∞, η−1) \ U, where r∞Rm denotes the curvature radius on
(d) rRm(·, t) < η on BM (q, t, η−1) \ V and

X .

|BX (q, t, η−1) \ V |t < η.

(e) For any y1, y2 ∈ U we have

|d(y1, y2) − dt(Φ(y1), Φ(y2))| < η.

(f ) For any 0 < r < η−1 we have

(1 − η)(cid:12)(cid:12)BX(q, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) − η <(cid:12)(cid:12)BM (q, t, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)t < (1 + η)(cid:12)(cid:12)BX (q∞, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) + η.

(g) For all x ∈ X and 0 < r, s < 1 we have

(cid:12)(cid:12){r∞Rm < sr} ∩ BX (x, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Esp0rn.

The major diﬃculty in the proof of Proposition 4.1 lies in verifying proper-
ties (C) and (E) of [Bam16, subsec 1.2] for the sequence of pointed Riemannian
manifolds (Mi, gi
0, qi). These properties will imply that the length metric on the
smooth part R of the limiting space X is equal to the restriction of its metric to
R, as well as the mildness of singularities of X . This will be achieved by con-
structing minimal time-0 geodesics as limits of certain L-geodesics, as explained
in subsection 4.2. The other statements will follow more or less using standard
techniques and the results of [Bam16].
4.2. Existence of short L-geodesics. In this subsection we will show that, in
a Ricci ﬂow with bounded scalar curvature, between almost any two points we
can ﬁnd an L-geodesic on a short time-interval that approximates a minimizing
geodesic at time 0.
We ﬁrst show that the L-length is bounded from below in terms of the distance.
This proof is similar to one direction of the distance distortion bound of [BZ15b].
Lemma 4.3 (L-length is almost bounded from below by distance). For any

Proof. Let x0 := γ(0), y0 := γ(θ) and η := θ2/3 ≥ 2θ. Observe ﬁrst that by
Proposition 3.3, we have

|dt1(x0, y0) − dt2(x0, y0)| < C1√η

Next consider the solution u ∈ C 0(M × [−η, 0])∩ C∞(M × (−η, 0]) to the heat

∂tu = △tu,

u(·,−η) = min{d−η(x0,·), D}.

Then by Corollary 3.5 we have for some constant C2 = C2(A) < ∞
u(x0, 0) = ˆM

K(x0, 0; z,−η) min{d−η(x0, z), D}dg−η(z)

≤ ˆM

K(x0, 0; z,−η)d−η(x0, z)dg−η(z) ≤ C2√η.

Next, by (4.1) we have

D ≥ d0(x0, y0) ≥ d−η(x0, y0) − C1√η.

So by the triangle inequality we have for all z ∈ M,
d−η(x0, y0) − min(cid:8)d−η(x0, z), D(cid:9)
≤ d−η(x0, y0) − min(cid:8)d−η(x0, z), d−η(x0, y0) − C1√η(cid:9) ≤ d−η(y0, z) + C1√η.
We now estimate u(y0,−θ). Recall that θ ≤ 1
as before,
u(y0,−θ) = d−η(x0, y0) − ˆM

2θ2/3 = 1

≥ d0(x0, y0) − C1√η −ˆM
≥ d0(x0, y0) − C3√η,

where C3 = C3(A) < ∞. So, in conclusion,

u(y0,−θ) − u(x0, 0) ≥ d0(x0, y0) − C4√η,

where C4 = C4(A) < ∞.

Consider now the quantity |∇u| on M × [−η, 0]. It is not hard to check that,

Since |∇u|(·,−η) ≤ 1, we have by the maximum principle that

|∇u| ≤ 1

We can control the time-derivative of u using [BZ15a, Lemma 3.1(a)]. We obtain
that there is a constant C5 = C5(D) < ∞ such that for all t ∈ (−η, 0]

Here L = L(x0,0) denotes the L-distance with respect to (x0, 0).
Proof. Assume that 0 < θ ≤ θ1, where θ1 will be determined in the course
of the proof of this claim. Due to Lemma 4.3, it suﬃces to verify the bound
L(y,−θ) < d2

Letting z vary over B(x0, 0, D+1) and using Fubini’s Theorem and Proposition 3.1

We can now choose θ1 = θ1(A, D, θ0, δ) ∈ (0, θ0) uniformly in such a way that

0(x0, y)(cid:1)+dg0(y) < δ2/2.
Let S′θ ⊂ B(x0, 0, D) be the set of points z ∈ B(x0, 0, D) such that

ˆB(x0,0,D)(cid:0)L(y,−θ) − d2

L(z,−θ) − d2

0(x0, z) < δ.

Then

|B(x0, 0, D) \ S′θ|0 · δ ≤ ˆB(x0,0,D)(cid:0)L(y,−θ) − d2
|B(x0, 0, D) \ S′θ|0 < δ/2.

It follows that

This ﬁnishes the proof of the claim.

0(x0, y)(cid:1)+dg0(y) < δ2/2.

(cid:3)

The set S will arise as a subset of S′θ for suﬃciently small θ ≤ θ1. By the Claim,
any subset S′θ already satisﬁes assertion (b1) of the lemma. We will now show
that for suﬃciently small θ, depending only on A, D, θ0, δ, the set S′θ also satisﬁes
assertion (b2) in the sense that for any y ∈ S′θ and any minimizing L-geodesic
γ : [0, θ] → M between x0 and y, γ(0) = x0, γ(θ) = y we have the bound from
assertion (b2). Consider such a minimizing L-geodesic γ. Then for any τ1 ∈ [0, θ],
we have

This shows assertion (b2), since D > 1. We will ﬁx θ from now on, set S′ := S′θ
and focus on assertion (b3).

For the rest of the proof let C = C(A, D, E, θ0, σ0, δ) < ∞ be a generic con-
stant. Using the estimates (4.7) and (4.8), we also obtain that for any such
L-geodesic γ : [0, θ] → M we have

Since θ was determined in terms of A, D, θ0, δ, this shows that we can choose a

d0(x0, γ(τ )) < εσ0

for all

τ ∈ [0, τ0].

(4.9)

Here ε = ε(A) is the constant from Proposition 3.2. Note that this bound can
also be derived using [KL08, equation (26.8)] and the upper bound on L(γ). See
also Lemma 4.6 below for a more precise result.

Consider now the L-exponential map at x0

L expτ = L expx0,τ : Tx0M → M.

and the subsets DLτ ⊂ Tx0M and GLτ ⊂ M as deﬁned in subsection 3.2. Set

f (x, τ ) :=(cid:0)rRm(x,−τ )(cid:1)−1.5.

Using assumption (iii), Propositions 3.1, 3.3 and a covering argument we deduce
that there is a constant E∗ = E∗(A, D, E) < ∞ such that for all t ∈ [−1, 0] and
0 < s < 1

Note that for any v ∈ U, the map τ 7→ L exp−τ (v) describes a minimizing
L-geodesic between (x0, 0) and (L expθ(v),−θ). Since L expθ(v) ∈ S′, we know
by Claim 1 that L expτ (v) ∈ B(x0, 0, D + 1) for all τ ∈ (0, θ]. In other words,
L expτ (U) ⊂ B(x0, 0, D + 1) for all τ ∈ (0, θ]. So for any τ ∈ (0, θ] we have

be a minimizing L-geodesic between x0 and y. Since y ∈ S ⊂ GLθ , this L-geodesic

We will now use the integral curvature bound in Lemma 4.4(b3) to integrate
the L-geodesic equation, under the assumption that the scalar curvature is small.
This will then enable us to bound the speed γ′(τ ) of any L-geodesic γ : [0, θ] → M
whose endpoint lies in S.
Lemma 4.5 (existence of L-geodesics with controlled speed). For any A, E, D <
∞ and σ0, θ0, δ > 0 there are constants θ = θ(A, D, θ0, δ) ∈ (0, θ0) and ρ =
ρ(A, E, D, θ0, σ0, δ) > 0 such that the following holds:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold M

and x0 ∈ M with the property that

(b) For any y ∈ S there is a minimizing L-geodesic γ : [0, θ] → M between x0

satisﬁes the assertions of this lemma if we assume that ρ is chosen suﬃciently
small, depending only on A, E, D, θ0, σ0, δ. Obviously, S satisﬁes assertion (a).

Before we continue with our analysis of L-geodesics, we establish the following
technical lemma, which we will later apply to L-geodesics of controlled speed.
This lemma can be seen as a generalization of (4.9) in the proof of Lemma 4.4 or
of [KL08, equation (26.8)].

Lemma 4.6 (curve of controlled speed cannot leave parabolic neighborhood too
soon). For any A, D < ∞ and σ0 > 0 there is a constant 0 < α0(A, D, σ0) < 1/2
such that the following holds:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold M

and x0 ∈ M with the property that

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ 1 on M × [−2, 0].

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

29

(iii) rRm(x0, 0) > σ0.
Assume that 0 < θ < 1 and that γ : (0, θ] → M, limτ→0 γ(τ ) = x0 is a smooth

curve such that

τ|γ′(τ )|2

−τ <

D2 + 1

4θ

for all

τ ∈ (0, θ].

Then

γ(τ ) ∈ B(x0, 0, σ0/10)

for all

τ ∈ [0, α0θ].

Proof. By Proposition 3.2 there is a constant 0 < ε = ε(A) < 1/10 such that

|Rm| < (ερ0)−2

on

P := P (x0, 0, εσ0,−(εσ0)2).

By a simple distance distortion estimate this implies that for all τ ∈ (0, (εσ0)2]

|γ′(τ )|0 ≤ 10|γ′(τ )|−τ

if

γ(τ ) ∈ B(x0, 0, εσ0).

Choose τ∗0 = α∗0θ ∈ (0, min{(εσ0)2, θ}] maximal with the property that γ(τ ) ∈
B(x0, 0, εσ0) for all τ ∈ [0, τ∗0 ). It suﬃces to derive a lower bound on α∗0 in terms
of A, D, σ0. For any τ′ ∈ [0, τ∗0 )

In the second case we obtain a lower bound on α∗0 in terms of A, D, σ0 immediately.
In the ﬁrst case we have τ∗0 = (εσ0)2 or τ∗0 = θ. This implies that α∗0 = (εσ0)2θ−1 >
(εσ0)2 or α∗0 = 1. So we still have a lower bound on α∗0 in terms of A, D, σ0. (cid:3)
Next, we improve the results of Lemmas 4.4 and 4.5 to ﬁnd even more regular
L-geodesics. The main innovation of the following lemma, is that the integral
curvature bound along short L-geodesics does not depend on the size of the time-
interval [0, θ] on which these L-geodesics are deﬁned or the size of the constant η
that governs the preciseness by which we can control the derivative of η. So we
will later be able to choose θ arbitrarily small, without deteriorating the integral
curvature bound.
In order to achieve this independence, however, we have to
assume that the scalar curvature is suﬃciently small.
Lemma 4.7 (Existence of L-geodesics with controlled speed along which the cur-
vature is bounded). For any A, E, D < ∞ and θ0, σ0, δ, η > 0 there are constants
C = C(A, E, D, σ0, δ) < ∞, θ = θ(A, E, D, θ0, σ0, δ, η) ∈ (0, θ0) and ρ = ρ(A, E,
D, θ0, σ0, δ, η) > 0 such that the following holds:

Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold M

and x0 ∈ M such that
(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ ρ on M × [−2, 0].
(iii) For all (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r, s < 0 we have
|{rRm(·, t) < sr} ∩ B(x, t, r)|t ≤ Es2rn.

(iv) rRm(x0, 0) > σ0.
Then there is a subset S ⊂ B(x0, 0, D) such that
(a) |B(x0, 0, D) \ S|0 < δ.
(b) For any y ∈ S there is a minimizing L-geodesic γ : [0, θ] → M between x0

and y, γ(0) = x0, γ(θ) = y such that
(b1) Its L-length satisﬁes

Note that here we take rRm at time 0 and not at time −τ as in
Lemma 4.4(b3).

Note that in this lemma the constant C does not depend on η or θ0.

Proof. We use a similar argument as in the proof of Lemma 4.4. The diﬀerence
is that this time we have a better estimate on the Jacobian of the L-exponential
map, due to assertion (b2) in Lemma 4.5. This fact will allow us to choose C
independently of θ.

Let us ﬁrst establish the following two bounds:

Claim. There is a constant E∗ = E∗(A, E, D) < ∞ such that

ˆB(x0,0,D+1)

r−1.5
Rm (x, 0)dg(x) < E∗.

and

|B(x0, 0, D)|0 < E∗.

Proof. These bounds follow from assumption (iii), Proposition 3.1 and a covering
argument.
(cid:3)

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

We can now choose the constants C, θ and ρ. Let α0 = α0(A, D, σ0) be the

constant from Lemma 4.6. Next, choose

E∗∗ = E∗∗(A, E, D, σ0) := 2eα−n/2

0 E∗ + 2(σ0/2)−1.5E∗

and

Note that C does not depend on the choice of θ0 or η. Next, we choose

C = C(A, E, D, σ0, δ) := 4E∗∗δ−1.

δ∗ := min{δ/2, η}

and we assume that ρ < min{ρ4.5(A, E, D, θ0, σ0, δ∗), 1/10}, where ρ4.5 is the
constant from Lemma 4.5.
We now apply Lemma 4.5 with A ← A, E ← E, D ← D, θ0 ← θ0, σ0 ← σ0
and δ ← δ∗, assuming ρ to be suﬃciently small. We obtain the constant θ =
θ(A, E, D, θ0, σ0, δ∗) ∈ (0, θ0) and a subset S ⊂ B(x0, 0, D), which we will denote
henceforth by S′, that satisﬁes assertions (a), (b) of that lemma. The subset
S ⊂ B(x0, 0, D), whose existence is claimed in this lemma, will arise as a subset
of S′.
Our proof uses again L-geometry and the terminology recalled in subsection 3.2.

Deﬁne

Then

For simplicity, we set

U := L exp−1
θ (S′) ∩ DLθ .
L expθ(U) = S′ ∩ GLθ .

f (x) := (rRm(x, 0))−1.5χB(x0,0,D+1)(x),

where χB(x0,0,D+1) is the characteristic function of B(x0, 0, D + 1). Note that by
the Claim, we have for all τ ∈ [0, θ] (assuming ρ < 1/10)

ˆM

f (x)dg−τ (x) < 2ˆM

f (x)dg0(x) < 2E∗.

So by the transformation formula, we have for all τ ∈ (0, θ]

ˆU

f(cid:0)L expτ (v)(cid:1)JL(v, τ )dv = ˆ

L expx0,τ (U )

f (x)dg−τ (x) < 2E∗

Using assertion (b3) of Lemma 4.5 and the estimate δ∗ < 1, we have for all

v ∈ U and τ ∈ (0, θ]

Moreover, by the monotonicity of τ−n/2e−l(v,−τ )J(v, τ ) we have

l(L expτ (v),−τ ) > l(L expτ (v),−θ) − 1.

θ−n/2e−l(L expτ (v),−θ)JL(v, θ) ≤ τ−n/2e−l(L expτ (v),−τ )JL(v, τ ).

Combining (4.19) with (4.20) yields that for all τ ∈ [α0θ, θ]

JL(v, θ) ≤ e(cid:16) θ

(4.21)
We now estimate the left-hand side of (4.21) for all τ ∈ (0, α0θ]. Observe that
by Lemma 4.6, we have L expτ (v) ∈ B(x0, 0, σ0/10) for all τ ∈ (0, α0θ]. Since
rRm(·, 0) is 1-Lipschitz with respect to g0, we have the bound f < (σ0/2)−1.5 on
B(x0, 0, σ0/10). So for all τ ∈ (0, τ0]
f(cid:0)L expτ (v)(cid:1)JL(v, θ)dv ≤ (σ0/2)−1.5ˆU

Then, by Fubini’s Theorem and (4.23),

ˆU

h(v)J(v, θ)dvdτ ≤ E∗∗θ.

Let

W := {v ∈ U : h(v) < Cθ} and S := L expθ(W ).

Then S ⊂ L expθ(U) ⊂ S′. We claim that S satisﬁes assertion (b). For any
y = L expθ(v), v ∈ W we choose the minimizing L-geodesic γ(τ ) := L expτ (v).
As y = γ(θ) ∈ GLθ , this L-geodesic is the only minimizing L-geodesic between x0
and y. So assertions (b1)–(b3) follow immediately from assertions (b1), (b2) and
(b4) of Lemma 4.5. For assertion (b4) observe that

ˆ θ

f (L expτ (v))dτ = h(v) < Cθ.

= 2ˆU\W

J(v, θ)dv ≤ 2ˆU\W

So

This ﬁnishes the proof.

Finally, we can improve the curvature bound in Lemma 4.7(b4) from an integral
bound to a pointwise bound. This bound will also enable us to show that the
L-geodesics are almost minimizing with respect to the time-0 metric.
Proposition 4.8. For any A, E, D < ∞ and σ0, δ, η > 0 there are constants
σ = σ(A, E, D, σ0, δ) and ρ = ρ(A, E, D, σ0, δ, η) > 0 such that the following
holds:

Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold M

and x0 ∈ M such that
(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ ρ on M × [−2, 0].
(iii) For all (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r, s < 1 we have
|{rRm(·, t) < sr} ∩ B(x, t, r)|t ≤ Es2rn.

(iv) rRm(x0, 0) ≥ σ0.

Then there is an open subset S ⊂ B(x0, 0, D) such that the following holds:

(a) |B(x0, 0, D) \ S|0 < δ.
(b) For any y ∈ S there is a curve γ : [0, 1] → M between x0 and y, γ(0) = x0,

γ(1) = y such that the following holds:
(b1) Its time-0 length satisﬁes

(b2) We have

ℓ0(γ) < d0(x0, y) + η.

rRm(γ(s), 0) > σ

for all

s ∈ [0, 1].

Note that the constant σ does not depend on the choice of η.

Proof. The idea of the proof will be to use the subset S and the L-geodesics γ
from Lemma 4.7. We will show that the function rRm(γ(τ ), 0) does not oscillate
too much and use assertion (b4) in Lemma 4.7 to establish a lower bound for
rRm(γ(τ ), 0). Using this bound and assertion (b3) of Lemma 4.7, we can then
derive an upper bound on the time-0 length of γ.

We will ﬁrst choose the relevant constants. Let ε = ε(A) > 0 be the con-
stant from Proposition 3.2. Let α0 = α0(A, D, σ0) < 1/2 be the constant from
Lemma 4.6 and set

a := min(cid:26)α1/2

0 (cid:0)2(D2 + 1)(cid:1)−1/2

,

1

10(cid:27).

(4.24)

Note that a depends only on A, E, D, σ0, δ. Next, let C = C(A, E, D, σ0, δ) be
the constant from Lemma 4.7 and choose σ > 0 small enough such that

1

2a(2σ)−0.5 > C,

aσ < α0/2,

σ < σ0/2 and σ < 1/10.

(4.25)

Note that all constants occurring in (4.25) only depend on A, E, D, σ0, δ. So σ
can be chosen depending only on these constants as well.

Next, choose and ﬁx a constant 0 < η∗ < 1, depending only on D, η, such that

(1 + η∗)(cid:0)d2 + η∗(cid:1)1/2

< d + η

for all

d ∈ [0, D).

RICHARD H BAMLER

Claim. There is a constant ρ1 = ρ1(A, E, D, σ0, δ, η) > 0 such that for all x ∈ M
with rRm(x, 0) ≥ σ, all v ∈ TxM and all t ∈ [−(εσ)2, 0] we have the distortion
estimate

|v|0 ≤ (1 + η∗)|v|t.

Proof. This fact follows from Propositions 3.2 and 3.6. The constant ρ2 can be
chosen depending only on ε, σ, which in turn only depend on A, E, D, σ0, δ,
η.
(cid:3)

Assume in the following that ρ < ρ1 and that ρ < ρ4.7(A, E, D, θ0, (εσ)2, δ, η∗),

where ρ4.7 is the constant from Lemma 4.7. Let furthermore

0 < θ = θ4.7(A, E, D, (εσ)2, σ0, δ, η∗) < (εσ)2

be the constant from Lemma 4.7.

We now apply Lemma 4.7 for A ← A, E ← E, D ← D, θ0 ← (εσ)2, σ0 ← σ0,
δ ← δ and η ← η∗. We obtain a subset S ⊂ B(x0, 0, D) that satisﬁes assertions
(a), (b) of Lemma 4.7. We claim that S satisﬁes assertions (a), (b) of this
proposition as well. Obviously, assertion (a) holds.

It remains to check assertion (b). Let y ∈ S and let γ : [0, θ] → M be the
L-geodesic from Lemma 4.7(b). In the following, we will show that γ satisﬁes
properties (b1), (b2), after reparameterization. By this we mean that ℓ0(γ) <
d0(x0, y) + η and

rRm(cid:0)γ(τ ), 0(cid:1) ≥ σ

for all

τ ∈ [0, θ].

(4.26)

An important tool in our analysis will be Lemma 4.7(b4), which states that

ˆ θ
0 (cid:0)rRm(γ(τ ), 0)(cid:1)−1.5dτ < Cθ.

(4.27)

We ﬁrst show that the bound (4.26) holds whenever τ ∈ [0, α0θ]. Indeed, for
all such τ , we have d0(x0, γ(τ )) < σ0/10 by Lemma 4.6 and thus, by the fact that
rRm is 1-Lipschitz with respect to g0, we have rRm(γ(τ ), 0) > σ0/2 > σ.

Next, we choose τ1 = α1θ maximal such that

rRm(γ(τ ), 0) ≥ σ
Then α1 = 1 or α1 < 1 and we have

for all

τ ∈ [0, τ1].

rRm(γ(α1θ), 0) = σ.

(4.28)

We will ﬁnd later that we indeed have α1 = 1, hence establishing assertion (b2).

Using the Claim, we ﬁnd that

|γ′(τ )|0 ≤ (1 + η∗)|γ′(τ )|−τ

for all

τ ∈ [0, τ1].

This inequality contradicts (4.25). So we indeed have α1 = 1 and τ1 = θ, which
proves assertion (b2).

To see assertion (b1), we apply (4.29) again for τ′ = 0 and obtain (using θ < 1

and D > 1)

If we don’t assume that the scalar curvature is small, we obtain a similar result

as Proposition 4.8, but this time σ depends on δ.
Corollary 4.9. For any A, E, D < ∞ and σ0, δ > 0 there is a constant σ =
σ(A, E, D, σ0, δ) > 0 such that the following holds:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold M

such that

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ 1 on M × [−2, 0].

(iii) For all (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r, s < 1 we have
|{rRm(·, t) < sr} ∩ B(x, t, r)|t ≤ Es2rn.

Then for any x, y ∈ M with d0(x, y) < D and

rRm(x, 0), rRm(y, 0) ≥ σ0

there is a smooth curve γ : [0, 1] → M between x and y, γ(0) = x, γ(1) = y whose
time-0 length satisﬁes

ℓ0(γ) < d0(x0, y) + δ

and such that

rRm(γ(s), 0) > σ

for all

s ∈ [0, θ].

Proof. The idea of the proof is to apply Proposition 4.8 several times at small
scales. We therefore ﬁrst derive the following claim.

Claim. For any δ∗, σ∗0 > 0 we can ﬁnd constants σ∗ = σ∗(A, E, σ∗0, δ∗), r∗0 = r∗0(A,
E, σ∗0, δ∗) > 0 such that the following holds:

For any 0 < r ≤ r∗0 and any z0 ∈ M with rRm(z0, 0) > σ∗0r there is an open

subset Sz0,r ⊂ B(z0, 0, r) such that

|B(z0, 0, r) \ Sz0,r|0 < δ∗rn

and such that for any z1 ∈ Sz0,r there is a smooth curve γ∗ : [0, 1] → M between
z0 and z1, γ(0) = z0, γ(1) = z1 such that

ℓ0(γ) < d0(z0, z1) + δ∗r

and such that

rRm(γ(s), 0) > σ∗r

for all

s ∈ [0, 1].

Proof. Using the constants σ and ρ from Proposition 4.8, we deﬁne σ∗(A, E, σ∗0,
δ∗) := σ(A, E, 1, σ∗0, δ∗) and r∗0(A, E, σ∗0, δ∗) = ρ1/2(A, E, 1, σ∗0, δ∗, δ∗). The claim
then follows from Proposition 4.8 for D ← 1 after rescaling by r−1.

4.3. Proof of the compactness result. Using Proposition 4.8 and Corol-
lary 4.9, we are now able to prove the main results of this section, Propositions 4.1
and 4.2.

Proof of Proposition 4.1. The proposition will essentially follow from [Bam16,
Theorem 1.2].
In order to apply this theorem, we have to verify that the se-
quence (Mi, gi
0, qi) of pointed Riemannian manifolds satisﬁes properties (A)–(F),
which are mentioned in [Bam16, subsec 1.2]. Before doing so, we mention that
in this paper we use a slightly diﬀerent deﬁnition of the curvature radius rRm
than in [Bam16]. The deﬁnition of the curvature radius in this paper (see Deﬁ-
nition 1.5) does not involve curvature derivatives, while the deﬁnition of rRm or

in our setting these three radii are comparable to one another: By deﬁnition, the

erRm in [Bam16] does. However, this diﬀerence does not create any issues, since
curvature radius rRm in our paper is bounded from below by rRm ≥ erRm from
CerRm ≤ CrRm from [Bam16], where C = C(A) < ∞ only depends on A.

[Bam16] and by Proposition 3.2 and Shi’s estimates, it is bounded from above by

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

39

Let us now verify the properties from [Bam16, subsec 1.2]: Property (A) is
a direct consequence of Proposition 3.1. Note that the constant A appearing in
property (A) can be chosen depending only on the constant A from assumption (i)
of this proposition. Also the constant T appearing in this property can be chosen
to be any T < lim supi→∞ Ti = T∞. Next, property (B) is a direct consequence
of assumption (iii). Here, the constant p0 appearing in this property has to be
chosen slightly smaller than the constant p0 in assumption (iii). Property (C) is
a direct consequence of Corollary 4.9. Property (D) follows from assumptions (i)
and (ii) of this proposition, where the constant A of this property depends on the
constant A of our proposition. Property (E) follows from Proposition 4.8 in the
case in which ρi → 0. Finally, property (F) follows from [BZ15a, Theorem 1.3].
The constants A and T appearing in this property can be chosen depending on
the constants A and T∞ of this proposition, respectively.
Now [Bam16, Theorem 1.2] implies that the pointed Riemannian manifolds
(Mi, gi
0, qi) converge to a pointed singular space (X , q∞) with singularities of codi-
mension p0. Note here, that in the context of [Bam16], the Riemannian metric
g on the regular part R of the singular space X = (X, d,R, g) as well as the
convergence of the metric were allowed to have regularity C 3 and in the present
paper, we require the regularity to be C∞. This extra regularity follows easily
from Proposition 3.2 and Shi’s estimates.

The ﬁrst part of assertion (b) of this proposition, namely the fact that Ric = 0,
follows from Propositions 3.2, 3.6 and the fact that ρi → 0. The statement about
the mildness in assertion (b) follows from assertion (a) of [Bam16, Theorem 1.2]
and the fact that property (E) of [Bam16] holds if ρi → 0. The statement about
the tameness in assertion (b) follows from assertion (b) of [Bam16, Theorem 1.2].
Assertions (c) and (e) of this proposition follow from assertions (a) and (c)
of [Bam16, Theorem 3.1], which is the more detailed version of [Bam16, Theo-
rem 1.2]. Assertion (b) of [Bam16, Theorem 3.1] and our discussion of the diﬀerent
deﬁnitions of the curvature radius implies that there is a C = C(A) < ∞ such
that for all x ∈ R
C−1 lim sup

(4.36)

rMi
Rm(Φi(x), 0).

rMi
Rm(Φi(x), 0) ≤ r∞Rm(x) ≤ C lim inf
i→∞

i→∞

We will now deduce assertion (d) of this proposition from this inequality. For this
let x ∈ R and ﬁx some 0 < r < r∞Rm(x). Then BX (x, r) ⊂ R is relatively compact
in R and |Rm| < r−2 on BX(x, r). By compactness, we have BX (x, r) ⊂ Ui for
large i. By lifting curves of length 0 < r′ < r that start in Φi(x), we can conclude
that for any 0 < r′ < r and large i we have BMi(Φi(x), r′) ⊂ Φi(BX(x, r)). So,
by the smooth convergence on R we have

lim inf
i→∞

rMi
Rm(Φi(x), 0) ≥ r∞Rm(x).

(4.37)

We now show the reverse inequality. So let x ∈ R and assume that 0 <
r ≤ lim supi→∞ rMi
Rm(Φi(x), 0). We want to show that then r∞Rm(x) ≥ r. To
see this, observe that for any 0 < r′ < r and y ∈ BX (x, r′) ∩ R we have
limi→∞ dMi
Rm(x,·) are 1-Lipschitz

0 (Φi(x), Φi(y)) = dX(x, y) < r′. So, since the rMi

40

0, we get

lim sup

i→∞

rMi
Rm(Φi(y), 0) ≥ lim sup
i→∞

rMi
Rm(Φi(x), 0) − r′ ≥ r − r′.

Using (4.36), we ﬁnd that for all y ∈ BX (x, r′)

r∞Rm(y) ≥ C−1(r − r′).

It follows that BX (x, r′) ⊂ R for all r′ < r and hence BX(x, r′) is relatively
compact in R for all r′ < r. By smooth convergence we have |Rm| < r−2 on
BX (x, r), which shows that r ≤ r∞Rm(x). So

lim sup

i→∞

rMi
Rm(Φi(x), 0) ≤ r∞Rm(x).

(4.38)

Combining (4.37) and (4.38) yields assertion (d).

Finally, assertion (a) is a consequence of assertion (d) and assumption (iii). (cid:3)

As a consequence, we obtain Proposition 4.2.

Proof of Proposition 4.2. First observe that by parabolic rescaling and rechoosing
the constants A, E it suﬃces to prove the proposition for t = 0. Fix now A, E, η
and p0 and assume that the statement was wrong. Choose a sequence ρi → 0 and
consider counterexamples (Mi, (gi
t)t∈[−2,0]) of Ricci ﬂows that satisfy assumptions
(i)–(iii) for ρ replaced by ρi and points qi ∈ M such that the conclusion does not
hold. Then we can use Proposition 4.1 to conclude that the (Mi, gi
0, qi) converge to
a pointed singular space (X, d,R, g, q∞) with Ric ≡ 0 on R and mild singularities.
Let (Ui, Vi, Φi) be a convergence scheme for this convergence. We claim that for
suﬃciently large i, the subsets U = U′i := Ui∩ B(xi, η−1− η/2), V = V ′i := Φi(U′i )
and Φ = Φ′i := Φi|U ′
To see this, observe that by deﬁnition of a convergence scheme assertions (a),
(b) and (e) hold automatically for large i. Assertions (c), (d) are a direct conse-
quence of Proposition 4.1(e). Assertion (f) follows from Proposition 4.1(c) and
the fact that due to volume comparison on X (see [Bam16, Proposition 4.1]) the
map r 7→ |BX(x, r) ∩ R| is continuous. Assertion (g) is a direct consequence of
Proposition 4.1(a).

satisfy assertions (a)–(g).

5. ε-regularity Theorem

5.1. Statement of the results. The main result of this section will be an ε-
regularity theorem for Ricci ﬂows with small scalar curvature that satisfy an
additional a priori Lp-curvature bound. More speciﬁcally, we will prove that
any ball with almost Euclidean volume has bounded curvature at its center,
if the scalar curvature bound is small enough. An important property of this
ε-regularity theorem is that the constants quantifying the curvature bound at
the center of this ball and the degree to which the volume of the ball is almost
Euclidean (namely ε) are independent of the imposed a priori Lp-curvature bound.
Only the scalar curvature bound will depend on this a priori Lp-curvature bound.
Based on the ε-regularity theorem and by passing to the limit we will further-
more show that the limiting singular space in Proposition 4.1 from section 4 is

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

41

Y -tame. Here Y only depends on a lower bound A on Perelman’s ν-functional
and not on the integral curvature bound Ep.

Let us now state the main results more precisely:

Proposition 5.1 (ε-regularity Theorem). For any A, E < ∞ and p > 3 there
are constants ε0 = ε0(A), σ0 = σ0(A), ρ = ρ(A, E, p) > 0 such that the following
holds:

Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional and orientable

manifold M and assume that

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ ρ on M × [−2, 0].
(iii) For all (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r, s < 1 we have
|{rRm(·, t) < sr} ∩ B(x, t, r)|t ≤ Esprn.

Then for any x0 ∈ M and 0 < r0 < 1 for which

we have rRm(x0, 0) > σ0r0.

|B(x0, 0, r0)|0 > (ωn − ε0)rn

0

Note that ε0 and σ0 don’t depend on E or p; only ρ does. This fact will be
important for us in section 6, where a value for E = E(A) will be determined
based on σ0 such that assumption (iii) always holds.

We also remark that a similar result was considered in [CW14, Proposition 4.16].
Using Proposition 5.1, we can reﬁne the compactness results of section 4.

Corollary 5.2 (regularity of the limit). For any A < ∞ there is a Y = Y (A) <
∞ such that the following holds:
Assume that we are in the setting of Proposition 4.1 and assume that ρi → 0,
p0 > 3 and that all Mi are orientable. Let X be the limiting singular space and
set T∞ := lim supi→∞ Ti.
Then X is Y -regular at scale √T∞ (in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.4).

5.2. Existence of almost geodesics that stay away from high curvature
regions. The main result of this subsection, Proposition 5.4, states that, as long
as the scalar curvature bound ρ is chosen small enough, we can ﬁnd an almost
geodesic between almost every pair of points with the following property: All
points on this almost geodesic have bounded curvature and small Ricci curvature
at all times of the time-interval [−1/2, 0].
geodesics on which the curvature is bounded at a single time.
Lemma 5.3. For any A, E, D < ∞, p > 1 and δ > 0 there are constants 0 <
σ∗ = σ∗(A, E, D, p, δ) < 1, C∗ = C∗(A, E, D) < ∞ and ρ = ρ(A, E, D, p, δ) > 0
such that the following holds:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold M

In order to show Proposition 5.4, we will ﬁrst show that we can ﬁnd such almost

with the property that
(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.

γy1,y2(ly1,y2) = y2 and

1 − δ < |γ′y1,y2(s)|t0 < 1 + δ

course of this proof, depending only on A, E, D, δ and choose ρ = ρ(A, E, η) > 0

can ﬁnd a pointed singular space (X , q∞) = (X, d,R, g, q∞) with Ric = 0 on R
and mild singularities, subsets U ⊂ R, V ⊂ M and a diﬀeomorphism Φ : U → V
such that assertions (a)–(g) of Proposition 4.2 hold. Moreover, by assertion (g)
of Proposition 4.2 and a covering argument involving volume comparison on X
(see [Bam16, Proposition 4.1]), we ﬁnd a constant E∗ = E∗(D, E) < ∞ such that
for all 0 < s < 1

Then S∗2 is closed in (BX(q∞, 2D)∩R)×(BX(q∞, 2D)∩R). By volume comparison
(see [Bam16, Proposition 4.1]) and Fubini’s Theorem, we have

[z1∈BX (q∞,2D)∩R

=

|S∗2| ≤(cid:12)(cid:12)BX (q∞, 2D) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) · ωnσn

Lastly, set

s ∈ [0, dX(z1, z2)](cid:9).
Then S∗3 is closed in ((BX (q∞, 2D)∩ R) × (BX(q∞, 2D)∩ R)) ∩ G∗. We will now
bound its measure. For this, let

r∞Rm(γ∗z1,z2(s)) ≤ 2σ∗

for some

:

W := {r∞Rm < 4σ∗} ∩ B(q∞, 4D) ∩ R.

Note that, since r∞Rm is 1-Lipschitz, we have for any (z1, z2) ∈ S∗3 \ S∗2

|{s ∈ [0, d(z1, z2)]

: γ∗z1,z2(s) ∈ W}| ≥ σ∗.

44

RICHARD H BAMLER

So setting f := χW in (5.1) yields

|S∗3 \ S∗2| · σ∗ ≤ CE∗(4σ∗)p < (δ/32)σ∗,

which implies

Set now

Then

(cid:12)(cid:12)S∗3 \ S∗2(cid:12)(cid:12) < δ/32.
S∗ := S∗1 ∪ S∗2 ∪ S∗3.

|S∗| = |S∗1 ∪ S∗2 ∪ (S∗3 \ S∗2)| < δ/16.

We will now construct S′ ⊂ M. For this, note that due to S∗3 ⊂ S∗ we have

(cid:0)BX(q∞, 2D) × BX(q∞, 2D)(cid:1) \ S∗ ⊂ {r∞Rm > σ∗} × {r∞Rm > σ∗}.

So, assuming η < σ∗ and using Proposition 4.2(c), we have

(cid:0)BX(q∞, 2D) × BX (q∞, 2D)(cid:1) \ S∗ ⊂ U × U.

Let now S′ be deﬁned as follows

S′ := B(x0, t0, D) × B(x0, t, D) \ (Φ × Φ)(cid:16)(cid:0)BX (q∞, 2D) × BX(q∞, 2D)(cid:1) \ S∗(cid:17).
Then S′ is closed in B(x0, t0, D) × B(x0, t, D) and can be expressed as the union
of

with

S′1 := (Φ × Φ)(S∗)

S′2 := (B(x0, t0, D) \ V ) × (B(x0, t, D) \ V ).

For suﬃciently small η (in a uniform way) we may assume that Jacobian of Φ is
bounded from above by 2 (see Proposition 4.2(b)) and hence

Furthermore, by Proposition 4.2(d)

|S′1|t0 ≤ 4|S∗| < δ/4.

So

|S′2|t0 ≤ |B(x0, t0, D) \ V |2

t0 < η2 < δ/4.

which implies assertion (a).

|S′|t0 ≤ |S′1|t0 + |S′2|t0 < δ/2,

Before we verify the remaining assertions, let us summarize our construction:

For any (y1, y2) ∈ (B(x0, t0, D) × B(x0, t0, D)) \ S′ ⊂ V × V , we have
(Φ−1(y1), Φ−1(y2)) ∈(cid:0)BX(q∞, 2D) × BX (q∞, 2D)(cid:1) \ S∗.

As S∗3 ⊂ S∗, this implies that for all s ∈ [0, dX(Φ−1(y1), Φ−1(y2))] we have

r∞Rm(γ∗Φ−1(y1),Φ−1(y2)(s)) > 2σ∗.

So, since we assumed η < σ∗, we conclude

γ∗Φ−1(y1),Φ−1(y2)(s) ∈ U.

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

Hence it is possible to make the following deﬁnition: for any (y1, y2) ∈ (B(x0, t0, D)×
B(x0, t0, D)) \ S′ ⊂ V × V let

ly1,y2 := dX(Φ−1(y1), Φ−1(y2))

and

γy1,y2(s) := Φ(cid:0)γ∗Φ−1(y1),Φ−1(y2)(s)(cid:1),

s ∈ [0, ly1,y2].

Assertions (b), (d), (e) now follow immediately for small enough η, depending on
δ. For assertion (c) observe that for small enough η, we have

rRm(γy1,y2(s), t0) > 1

2r∞Rm(Φ−1(γy1,y2(s))) = 1

2r∞Rm(Φ−1(γ∗y1,y2(s))) > σ∗.

Assertion (f) follows from (5.1) by replacing f : M → [0,∞) by (f ◦ Φ)χU : R →
[0,∞)

(cid:3)

We can now prove the main result of this subsection.

Proposition 5.4. For any A, E, D < ∞, p > 3 and δ > 0 there are constants
ρ = ρ(A, E, D, p, δ), σ(A, E, D, p, δ) > 0 such that the following holds:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold M

with the property that
(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ ρ on M × [−2, 0].
(iii) For all (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r, s < 1 we have
|{rRm(·, t) < sr} ∩ B(x, t, r)|t ≤ Esprn.

Let x0 ∈ M and t0 ∈ [− 1

2, 0]. Then there is a subset
S ⊂ B(x0, t0, D) × B(x0, t0, D)

such that the following holds:

(a) We have

with respect to the product measure dgt0 ⊗ dgt0

(b) For any

|S|t0 < δ

(y1, y2) ∈(cid:0)B(x0, t0, D) × B(x0, t0, D)(cid:1) \ S

there is a smooth curve γy1,y2 : [0, 1] → M with γy1,y2(0) = y1, γy1,y2(1) =
y2 such that

and such that

|ℓt0(γy1,y2) − dt0(y1, y2)| < δ

rRm(γy1,y2(s), t) > σ

for all

s ∈ [0, 1] and t ∈ [−1, 0]

and

|Ric|(γy1,y2(s), t) < δ

for all

s ∈ [0, 1] and t ∈ [−1, 0].

RICHARD H BAMLER

Proof. Fix A, E, D < ∞, p > 3 and δ > 0. Assume without loss of generality that
δ < 0.1. Assume that ρ is chosen small enough such that we can apply Lemma 5.3
at (x0, t0) and let 0 < σ∗ = σ∗(A, E, D, p, δ) < 1 and C∗(A, E, D) < ∞ be the
constants from this lemma. Next, using Proposition 3.3, we may choose a constant
D∗ = D∗(A, D) < ∞ such that

B(x0, t0, D) ⊂ B(x0, t, D∗)

for all

t ∈ [−1, 0].

And using assumption (iii), a covering argument and Proposition 3.1, we can ﬁnd
a constant E∗ = E∗(A, D, E) < ∞ such that for all 0 < s < 1 and t ∈ [−1, 0]

|{rRm(·, t) < s} ∩ B(x0, t0, D)|t < E∗sp.

(5.2)

Let ε = ε(A) > 0 be the constant from the Backwards and Forward Pseudolocality
Theorem, Proposition 3.2 and assume without loss of generality that ε < 0.1.
Moreover, choose an integer N = N(A, E, D, p, δ) < ∞ such that

N 1/2ε(cid:19)p−1

< 1

and

10

N 1/2ε

< εσ∗ < 1

(this is possible since p > 3) and determine σ0 = σ0(A, E, D, p, δ) > 0 by

σ0 :=

N 1/2ε

.

Then

σ0 < εσ∗,

We will assume in the following that ρ = ρ(A, E, D, p, δ) > 0 is chosen small
enough such that, using Proposition 3.6, we can conclude that |Ric|(y, t) < δ at
any (y, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] at which rRm(y, t) > σ.

Set for i = 0, . . . , N − 1

Consider now the subset S′ ⊂ B(x0, t0, D) × B(x0, t0, D) from Lemma 5.3 and
the family of curves

γy1,y2 : [0, ly1,y2] −→ M,

(y1, y2) ∈(cid:0)(B(x0, t0, D) × B(x0, t0, D)(cid:1) \ S′

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

Set

:

ˆ ly1,y2

0(cid:27).
f (γy1,y2(s))ds ≥ 2δ−1NC∗E∗σp

Then, using the segment inequality in assertion (e) of Lemma 5.3 combined with
(5.4), we ﬁnd

|S′′|t0 · 2δ−1NC∗E∗σp

0 < C∗NE∗σp
0 .

We will now verify assertion (b). To do this, observe that, by (5.3), for any

This implies |S′′|t0 < δ/2, so if we set S := S′ ∪ S′′, then assertion (a) holds.
(y1, y2) ∈ (B(x0, t0, D) × B(x0, t0, D)) \ S we have for any i = 0, . . . , N − 1

(5.5)

(5.6)

ˆ ly1,y2

0

χWi(γy1,y2(s))ds < 2δ−1NC∗E∗σp

0 < σ0/4.

We will use this bound to show that for all i = 0, . . . , N − 1 we have
s ∈ [0, ly1,y2].

rRm(cid:16)γy1,y2(s),−

N(cid:17) > σ0/2

for all

i

To see that (5.6) holds for all i = 0, . . . , N − 1, recall ﬁrst that by assertion (c)
of Lemma 5.3 we have rRm(γy1,y2(s), t0) > σ∗ for all s ∈ [0, ly1,y2]. It follows by
Proposition 3.2 and (5.3) that for all t ∈ [−1, 0] with |t − t0| ≤ (εσ∗)2 we have

rRm(γy1,y2(s), t) > εσ∗ > σ0/2

for all

s ∈ [0, ly1,y2].

So since (εσ∗)2 > 100
N (see (5.3)), there is at least one i for which (5.6) holds.
More speciﬁcally, there are i1, i2 ∈ {0, . . . , N − 1} such that − i2
N and
such that (5.6) holds for all i = i1, . . . , i2. Assume now that (5.6) does not hold
for all i = 0, . . . , N − 1 and pick i0 such that (5.6) does not hold for i = i0 and
such that |t0 + i0
N| is minimal with this property. In other words, (5.6) holds for
all i = 0, . . . , N − 1 for which |t0 + i
N| but not for i = i0. We will now
derive a contradiction to this assumption. Recall from (5.3) that (εσ0/2)2 = 1
N .
So, by Proposition 3.2, we have

N < t0 < − i1

N| < |t0 + i0

rRm(γy1,y2(s), t) > εσ0/2 = σ
N , t0] or t ∈ [t0,− i0

for all t ∈ [− i0
N ], depending on whether i0 > i2 or i0 < i1. As
discussed before, by our small choice of ρ, this implies that for all such t we have

for all

s ∈ [0, ly1,y2]

(5.7)

|Ric|(γy1,y2(s), t) < δ

(5.8)
So, since |γ′y1,y2(s)|t0 < 1 + δ and δ < 0.1, a distance distortion estimate yields
that |γ′y1,y2(s)|t < 2 for all t ∈ [− i0
N ]. So the function s 7→
rRm(γy1,y2(s),− i0
N ) is 2-Lipschitz. By the choice of i0, there is an s0 ∈ [0, ly1,y2]
such that

s ∈ [0, ly1,y2].

for all

N , t0] or t ∈ [t0,− i0
N(cid:17) ≤ σ0/2

i0

rRm(cid:16)γy1,y2(s0),−

48

RICHARD H BAMLER

Using the 2-Lipschitz property, we conclude that for all s ∈ [0, ly1,y2] with |s−s0| <
σ0/4 we have

rRm(cid:16)γy1,y2(s),−

i0

N(cid:17) < σ0.

In other words, γy1,y2(s) ∈ Wi0 for all s ∈ [0, ly1,y2] with |s− s0| < σ0/4. Since, by
Lemma 5.3(e), ly1,y2 > σ∗ > σ0/4, this contradicts (5.5).
So (5.6) holds for all i = 0, . . . , N − 1. As before, it follows that (5.7) and (5.8)
hold for all t ∈ [−1, 0]. This ﬁnishes the proof of assertion (b).
5.3. Existence of almost optimal L-geodesics and a reduced volume
bound. In this subsection, we will use the existence of almost geodesics that
avoid regions of high curvature to construct short L-geodesics between a given
basepoint and a set of points of large measure. Based on this construction we will
eventually derive a good lower bound on the reduced volume at that basepoint.
Lemma 5.5. For any A, E, D < ∞, p > 3, 0 < τ0 ≤ 1/2 and δ > 0 there is a
constant ρ = ρ(A, E, D, p, τ0, δ) > 0 such that the following holds:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional and orientable

(cid:3)

manifold M with the property that

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ ρ on M × [−2, 0].
(iii) For all (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r, s < 1 we have
|{rRm(·, t) < sr} ∩ B(x, t, r)|t ≤ Esprn.

Consider a point x0 ∈ M. Then there is a subset
S ⊂ B(x0, t0, D)

such that the following holds:

(a) We have

(b) For any

we have

|S|0 < δ.

z ∈ B(x0, 0, D) \ S

L(x0,0)(z,−τ0) = 2√τ0L(x0,0)(z,−τ0) < d2

0(x0, z) + δ.

Here L(x0,0) denotes the L-distance based at (x0, 0).

Moreover, the reduced volume at (x0, 0) satisﬁes

(5.9)

Proof. Let us ﬁrst construct S such that assertions (a) and (b) hold. The bound
(5.9) will then follow easily.

In order to construct S, we ﬁrst introduce a constant 0 < θ ≤ τ0 that will be
chosen small enough in the course of the proof depending only on A, E, D, τ0 and
δ. The constant ρ will be chosen small enough depending on A, E, D, τ0, δ and θ
in the course of this proof. In the following we will construct curves with bounded

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

49

L-length between (x0, 0) and a large set of points (z,−τ0). These curves will arise
as a concatenation of a short L-geodesic between (x0, 0) and some point (y,−θ)
and a reparameterization of the curves from Proposition 5.4 to the interval [θ, τ0].
Let us ﬁrst construct suﬃciently many short L-geodesics based at (x0, 0). For
this, we will argue similarly as in the Claim of Lemma 4.4. As explained in the
proof of this claim we obtain the following special case of (4.6) for z ← x0

ˆM

K(x0, 0; y,−θ)L(x0,0)(y,−θ)dg−θ(y) ≤ 2nθ.

Next, assuming ρ < 1,

L(x0,0)(y,−θ) > −2√θˆ θ

Consider now the integral

ˆM

K(x0, 0; y,−θ)(cid:0)L(x0,0)(y,−θ) + 2θ2(cid:1)dg−θ(y) ≤ 2nθ + 2θ2.

The integrand of this integral is positive everywhere. So, by volume distortion
estimates, the lower bound on the heat kernel (see Proposition 3.4) and the fact

that |B(x0, 0,√θ)|0 > cθn/2 for some uniform c = c(A) > 0 (see Proposition 3.1),
we can ﬁnd a constant C = C(A) < ∞ such that
L(x0,0)(y,−θ)dg0(y) ≤  B(x0,0,√θ)(cid:0)L(x0,0)(y,−θ) + 2θ2(cid:1)dg0(y) ≤ Cθ.
 B(x0,0,√θ)
U :=(cid:8)y ∈ B(x0, 0,√θ)

: L(x0,0)(y,−θ) < 2Cθ(cid:9),

It follows that if we set

then

Apply now Proposition 5.4 with A ← A, E ← E, D ← D, p ← p, δ ← δ′,
(x0, t0) ← (x0, 0) for suﬃciently small ρ (depending on A, E, D, τ0, δ) and let S′ ⊂
B(x0, 0, D) × B(x0, 0, D) be the subset that is denoted by S in that proposition.
For any z ∈ B(x0, 0, D) let m(z) := |S′ ∩ ({z} × B(x0, 0, D))|0 be the time-0
measure of the section through z. By Fubini’s Theorem

ˆB(x0,0,D)

m(y)dg0(y) = |S′|0 < δ′.

We now ﬁx the constant θ = θ(A, E, D, p, τ0, δ) > 0 small enough such that

0 < θ < τ0 and such that the following holds:

δ′(cid:16) c

δ′ < θ

and

θn/2(cid:17)−1

< δ.

Based on this choice, we pick δ′ = δ′(A, E, D, p, θ, δ) > 0 such that

for all

0 ≤ d < D. (5.10)

50

RICHARD H BAMLER

It follows that there is a point y ∈ U such that

Let now S ⊂ B(x0, 0, D) be the subset for which

m(y) < δ′(cid:16) c

{y} × S = S′ ∩(cid:0){y} × B(x0, 0, D)(cid:1).

Then S satisﬁes assertion (a).

Next, we show assertion (b). Choose an L-geodesic γ∗ : [0, θ] → M with

γ(0) = x0, γ(θ) = y and

L0(γ∗) = L(x0,0)(y, θ) =

1
2√θ

L(x0,0)(y, θ) < C√θ.

(5.11)

Let z ∈ S and recall that (y, z) ∈ S′. Let γ : [√θ,√τ0] → M be a constant speed
parameterization of the curve γz,y : [0, 1] → M obtained in Proposition 5.4(b)
2√τ γ′(√τ ). Thus,
and deﬁne γ : [θ, τ0] → M by γ(τ ) := γ(√τ ). So γ′(τ ) = 1
since by Proposition 5.4, we have |Ric|(γ(s), t) < δ′ < θ for all s ∈ [θ, τ0] and
t ∈ [−1, 0], we have

(5.10)

L(x0,0)(z, τ0) ≤ 2√τ0L0(γ∗∗)

This proves assertion (b).

(5.9).
(cid:3)
Lemma 5.6. For any A, E < ∞, p > 3 and δ > 0 there are constants 0 < ν =
ν(δ), ρ = ρ(A, E, p, δ) < 1 such that the following holds:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional and orientable

manifold M and x0 ∈ M and assume that

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ ρ on M × [−2, 0].
(iii) For all (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r, s < 1 we have
|{rRm(·, t) < sr} ∩ B(x, t, r)|t ≤ Es3.9rn.

(iv) We have

|B(x0, 0, ν−1)|0 > (ωn − ν)(ν−1)n.
Then for all x ∈ B(x0, 0, 1), the reduced volume satisﬁes.

Note that ν does not depend on A, E or p.

eV(x,0)(1/2) > 1 − δ.

Since X has mild singularities and satisﬁes Ric = 0 on R, we can apply Bishop-
Gromov volume comparison on X (see [Bam16, Proposition 4.1]) and obtain that

(cid:12)(cid:12)BX (q∞, r) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) > (ωn − 3ν)rn

Using assertion (f) of Proposition 4.2 again, we get

5.4. Proof of the regularity theorems. We ﬁrst need to establish the following
gap theorem for the reduced volume:
Lemma 5.7. For any A < ∞ there are constants δ = δ(A), σ = σ(A) > 0 such
that the following holds:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional and orientable

manifold M and x0 ∈ M and assume that

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ 1 on M × [−2, 0].
(iii) For all x ∈ B(x0, 0, 1) the reduced volume satisﬁes

Then rRm(x0, 0) > σ.

eV(x,0)(1/2) > 1 − δ.

Proof. Note that by the monotonicity of the reduced volume, we have

1 ≥ eV(x,0)(τ ) > 1 − δ

for all

τ ∈ (0, 1/2].

Assume now that the statement of the Lemma was false and pick arbitrary
t)t∈[−2,0]) and
0 ∈ Mi such that conditions (i)–(iii) of the lemma hold, but for which

sequences δi, σi → 0. Then we can ﬁnd a sequence of ﬂows (Mi, (gi

BMi(yi, 0, 1
t )t∈[−2Qi,0]) be the ﬂows that arise from
parabolic rescaling of (Mi, (gi
t)t∈[−2,0]) by Qi. Then, in these rescaled ﬂows we have
|Rm′|(yi, 0) = 1 and |Rm′|(·, 0) ≤ 4 on B′(yi, 0, 1
(τ ) > 1 − δ
2√ai) and 0 < τ ≤ Qi/2. Moreover, by Proposition 3.2, we
for all x ∈ B′(yi, 0, 1
have

P ′i := P ′(cid:0)yi, 0, 1
for some uniform ε = ε(A) > 0. Lastly, due to Proposition 3.1, we have
4√ai), where κ = κ(A) > 0 is some
|B′(x, 0, 1)|0 > κ for all x ∈ B′(yi, 0, 1

blow-up sequence, we have R ≡ 0 and hence Ric ≡ 0 on M∞ × (−ε2/4, 0].

Consider the L-exponential maps on (Mi, (g′i

L exp(xi,0),τ : TxiMi −→ Mi,

their Jacobians JL(xi,0)(·, τ ) : TxiMi → R and the subsets DL(xi,0),τ ⊂ TxiMi,
GL(xi,0),τ ⊂ Mi as deﬁned in subsection 3.2. Fix some constant D < ∞ and
deﬁne the subsets

SD,i := L exp(xi,0),τ(cid:0)TxiMi \ B(0xi, D)(cid:1) ⊂ Mi.

Due to the curvature bound (5.14), we ﬁnd that for suﬃciently large i (depending
on D) the following is true: for all v ∈ B(0xi, D) ⊂ TxiMi, the image of the L-
geodesic

γv : [0, τ ] → Mi,

τ′ 7→ L exp(xi,0),τ ′(v)

2√ai). So the maps L exp(xi,0),τ smoothly converge to L exp(x∞,0),τ
lies in B′(yi, 0, 1
on B(0xi, D) ⊂ TxiMi. Moreover, there is some constant D∗ < ∞, which does not
depend on i, such that Mi \ SD,i ⊂ B′(xi, 0, D∗) for all i. Note that, if i is large,
then for all z ∈ Mi \ SD,i, the L-distance L(xi,0)(z,−τ ) is given by the L-length
of an L-geodesic γv for some v ∈ B(0zi, D) ⊂ TxiMi. So for any z ∈ M∞ and
zi ∈ Mi with zi → z∞ for which zi ∈ Mi \ SD,i for inﬁnitely many i, we have

l(x∞,0)(z,−τ ) ≤ lim inf

Letting D → ∞ yields that the left-hand side of (5.15) is not smaller than the
right-hand side. The reverse inequality is always true by default.

We can ﬁnally prove Proposition 5.1 and Corollary 5.2.

Proof of Proposition 5.1. Let δ = δ(A), σ = σ(A) > 0 be the constants from
Lemma 5.7 and determine ν = ν(δ) from Lemma 5.6. Set ε0 = ε0(A) := ν.

RICHARD H BAMLER

By combining those lemmas we conclude that whenever ρ is suﬃciently small,
depending on A, E, p, and

|B(x0, 0, ν−1)|0 > (ωn − ν)(ν−1)n,

then rRm(x0, 0) > σ. The proposition now follows via parabolic rescaling by
(r0ν)2.
(cid:3)

Proof of Corollary 5.2. The Y -regularity of the limit follows immediately from
Proposition 5.1 and assertions (c) and (d) of Proposition 4.1. The constant Y
can be chosen only depending on ε0 and σ0 of Proposition 5.1, which in turn only
depend on A.

Alternatively, observe that Proposition 5.1 implies property (G) from [Bam16,
subsec 1.2] for an A that only depends on the A from Proposition 4.1. The
corollary follows now using [Bam16, Theorem 1.2(c)].
(cid:3)

6. Proof of the main theorems

6.1. Proof of the integral curvature bound. We ﬁrst prove the following
covering lemma, whose result we will iterate later.
Lemma 6.1. For any A < ∞ and 0 < p < 4 there is a constant H = H(A, p) <
∞ such that:
For any E′ < ∞ and 0 < λ < 1 there is a constant 0 < r = r(A, p, E′, λ) < 1
such that the following holds:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional and orientable

manifold M and 0 < r0 ≤ r a scale with the property that

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ 1 on M × [−2, 0].
(iii) For all (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r < r0 and 0 < s < 1 we have

|{rRm(·, t) < sr} ∩ B(x, t, r)|t ≤ E′s3.1rn.

Then for any x ∈ M and 0 < r ≤ 10r0 we can ﬁnd at most Hλp−n many points
y1, . . . , ym ∈ M, m < Hλp−n such that

{rRm(·, 0) < λr} ∩ B(x, 0, r) ⊂

B(yj, 0, λr).

(6.1)

m[j=1

Proof. Fix the constants A and p for the rest of the proof and determine Y =
Y (A) as the maximum of the corresponding constants from Proposition 4.1(b)
and Corollary 5.2. So every blow-up limit X of Ricci ﬂows (Mi, (gi
t)t∈[−2,0]) that
satisfy assumptions (i)–(iii), as obtained via Proposition 4.1, is a singular space
X = (X, d,R, g) with mild singularities of codimension 3.1 that satisﬁes Ric ≡ 0
on R, that is Y -tame and Y -regular at all scales. Consider such a blow-up limit
X for a moment. We can now apply [Bam16, Theorem 1.6] to X and we obtain
a constant E = E(p, Y (A)) < ∞, which only depends on p and Y and hence on
A, such that X satisﬁes the bound

|{rXRm < sr} ∩ BX(x∞, r) ∩ R| ≤ Esprn

(6.2)

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

57

for all x∞ ∈ X, r > 0 and 0 < s < 1. Fix this constant E = E(p, Y (A)) for the
rest of the proof and remember that E only depends on A and p.
Next, we show that for any E′ < ∞ and 0 < λ < 1 there is a constant

r = r(A, p, E′, λ) > 0 such that for any x ∈ M and 0 < r ≤ r

|{rRm(·, 0) < 2λr} ∩ B(x, 0, 2r)|0 < 2E(2λ)p(2r)n.

(6.3)
Assume that there was no such r for some ﬁxed E′, λ. Then we can ﬁnd a sequence
of Ricci ﬂows (Mi, (gi
t)t∈[−2,0]) that satisfy assumptions (i)–(iii) and points xi ∈
Mi, 0 < ri < 10r0,i with r0,i, ri → 0 such that for all i

i → 0 on M′i × [−r−2
Note that |R| ≤ r2
, 0]. So we can apply Proposition 4.1(b)
to conclude that, after passing to a subsequence, we have convergence of the
pointed Riemannian manifolds (M′i , g′i
0 , xi) to some singular space (X , x∞) with
mild singularities of codimension 3.1 that satisﬁes Ric ≡ 0 on R, that is Y -tame
and Y -regular at all scales. The convergence can be described by a convergence
scheme {(Ui, Vi, Φi)}∞i=1. Moreover, the limit space X satisﬁes (6.2).
We will now derive a contradiction by passing (6.4) to the limit. Fix some
ε > 0 for the moment and observe that we have by Proposition 4.1(e) for large i

t)t∈[−2,0]) by

(6.4)

So by the parabolically rescaled assumption (iii) we have for large i

i (xi, 0, 1) \ Vi

Combining this with (6.4) and Proposition 4.1(d), we ﬁnd

i

i (xi, 0, 2).

(cid:12)(cid:12){rXRm(·, 0) < 2λ + ε} ∩ BX(x∞, 2 + ε) ∩ R(cid:12)(cid:12) > 2Eλp − E′(cid:0)ε/2(cid:1)3.12n.

For suﬃciently small ε this contradicts (6.2) and hence shows (6.3).

We will now use (6.3) to show (6.1). To do this, choose m ∈ N maximal such
that we can ﬁnd points y1, . . . , ym ∈ {rRm(·, 0) < λr}∩B(x, 0, r) with the property
that the balls B(y1, 0, λr/2), . . . , B(ym, 0, λr/2) are pairwise disjoint. Then
B(y1, 0, λr/2), . . . , B(ym, 0, λr/2) ⊂ {rRm(·, 0) < 2λr} ∩ B(x, 0, 2r).

By Proposition 3.1 there is a constant c = c(A) > 0, which only depends on A,
such that

It follows using (6.3) that

|B(yj, 0, λr/2)|0 > c(λr/2)n.

m <

RICHARD H BAMLER

Note that H = H(A, p) only depends on A and p. By the maximal choice of m
we conclude (6.1), which ﬁnishes the proof.
(cid:3)

Applying Lemma 6.1 successively for suﬃciently small λ yields:

Lemma 6.2. For any A < ∞ and 0 < p < 4 there is a constant Ep(A) < ∞
such that:
For any E′ < ∞ there is a constant 0 < r = r(A, p, E′) < 1 such that the
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional and orientable

following holds:

manifold M and 0 < r0 ≤ r a scale with the property that

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ 1 on M × [−2, 0].
(iii) For all (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r < r0 and 0 < s < 1 we have

|{rRm(·, t) < sr} ∩ B(x, t, r)|t ≤ E′s3.1rn.
Then for any x ∈ M and 0 < r ≤ 10r0 and 0 < s < 1 we have
|{rRm(·, 0) < sr} ∩ B(x, 0, r)|0 < Epsprn.

(6.5)
Proof. Fix A < ∞ and 0 < p < 4 for the rest of the proof and choose some
p′ = p(p′) such that p < p′ < 4. Let H = H(A, p′) be the constant from
Lemma 6.1. Based on this constant choose 0 < λ = λ(A, p, p′) < 1 small enough
such that

Hλp

′−p < 1.

Consider now the constant E′ and choose r = r(A, p′, E′, λ) according to
Lemma 6.1. Applying Lemma 6.1 multiple times yields that for any integer
k ≥ 1 there are at most (Hλp

′−n)k many points y1, . . . , ym ∈ M such that

{rRm(·, 0) < λkr} ∩ B(x, 0, r) ⊂

B(yj, 0, λkr).

m[j=1

By Proposition 3.1 there is a constant C = C(A) < ∞, which only depends on
A, such that the time-0 volume of the balls B(yj, 0, λkr) is bounded from above
by C(λkr)n. Thus
|{rRm(·, 0) < λkr} ∩ B(x, 0, r)|0 < C(λkr)n(Hλp

′−n)k

= Cλpk(Hλp

′−p)krn < Cλpkrn.

As λ and C only depended on A and p, this bound implies (6.5) for some suitable
Ep = Ep(A) < ∞.
(cid:3)

Next, we show that assumption (iii) in Lemma 6.2 always holds for a suitable

E′ = E′(A).
Lemma 6.3. For any A < ∞ there are constants E′ = E′(A) < ∞ and r = r(A)
such that:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional and orientable

manifold M with the property that

CONVERGENCE OF RICCI FLOWS WITH BOUNDED SCALAR CURVATURE

59

(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ 1 on M × [−2, 0].

Then for any (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r < r and 0 < s < 1 we have

|{rRm(·, t) < sr} ∩ B(x, 0, r)|t < E′s3.1rn.

(6.6)
Proof. Fix A and choose E′ := E3.1(A) < ∞ according to Lemma 6.2. Next
choose 0 < r = r(A, 3.1, E′) < 1 according to Lemma 6.2. It follows that when-
ever for all (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r < r and 0 < s < 1 the bound (6.3)
holds, then it also holds for all x ∈ M and 0 < r ≤ 10r and 0 < s < 1.
Let us now apply this conclusions to parabolic rescalings of (gt)t∈[−2,0]. Let
0 < r0 ≤ 1 and t0 ∈ [−2 + 2r2
0, 0] and consider the parabolic rescaling g′t :=
r−2
0(t+t0), which is deﬁned for at least all times t ∈ [−2, 0]. The time-interval
0 gr2
[−2, 0] for (g′t)t∈[−2,0] corresponds to the time-interval [t0 − 2r2
0, t0] for (gt)t∈[−2,0].
By the monotonicity of the ν-functional we have

−2, 4] = ν(cid:2)gt0−2r2

0

, 4a2(cid:3) ≥ ν[g−2, 4r2

ν[g′

0 + (t0 − 2r2
= ν[g−2, 2r2

Whenever 0 < r0 ≤ 1 and t0 ∈ [−2 + 2r2

0 + 2)]
0 + t0 + 2] ≥ ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
So the rescaled ﬂow (g′)t∈[−2,0] still satisﬁes assumptions (i) and (ii). Hence, apply-
ing our previous conclusion to (g′)t∈[−2,0] and rescaling back shows the following:
0, 0] and whenever the bound (6.6) holds
for all (x, t) ∈ M × [t0 − r2
0, t0] and 0 < r < rr0 and 0 < s < 1, then it also holds
for all x ∈ M and 0 < r ≤ 10rr0 and 0 < s < 1.
Assume now that the conclusion of the Lemma was wrong with our choice of
E′. Then we can ﬁnd some (x1, t1) ∈ M × [−1, 0], 0 < r1 < r and 0 < s1 < 1
such that (6.6) fails for x ← x1, t ← t1, r ← r1 and s ← s1. By the contrapositive
of our previous conclusion for t0 ← t1, r0 ← 1
10r−1r1 this implies that we can
ﬁnd some x2 ∈ M, t2 ∈ [t1 − 2( 1

such that (6.6) fails for x ← x2, t ← t2, r ← r2 and s ← s2. Repeating this
argument yields a sequence (x1, t1, r1, s1), (x2, t2, r2, s2), . . . such that rk+1 ≤ 1
10rk
and |tk+1 − tk| ≤ 2( 1
10r−1rk)2 and such that (6.6) fails for x ← xk, t ← tk,
r ← rk and s ← sk for all k = 1, 2, . . .. As rk < ( 1
10)k−1r, we ﬁnd that tk stays
within [−1.5, 0]. So the process can be continued indeﬁnitely. However, by the
smoothness of (gt)t∈[−2,0] there is some large k for which the left-hand sided of
(6.6) is zero for x ← xk, t ← tk, r ← rk and s ← sk. This gives us the necessary
contradiction.

We can ﬁnally state our most general bound on the sublevel sets of rRm.

Proposition 6.4. For any A < ∞ and 0 < p < 4 there is a constant E =
Ep(A) < ∞ such that:
Let (M, (gt)t∈[−2,0]) be a Ricci ﬂow on a compact, n-dimensional manifold M
with the property that
(i) ν[g−2, 4] ≥ −A.
(ii) |R| ≤ 1 on M × [−2, 0].

Then for any (x, t) ∈ M × [−1, 0] and 0 < r, s < 1 we have
|{rRm(·, t) < sr} ∩ B(x, 0, r)|t < Epsprn.

Proof. This follows from Lemmas 6.2, 6.3 and a covering argument using Propo-
sition 3.1. In the non-orientable case, we need to pass to the orientable double
cover.
(cid:3)

As a consequence, we obtain Theorem 1.6.

Proof of Theorem 1.6. The theorem follows from Proposition 6.4 after parabolic
rescaling by A, a covering argument and the co-area formula.
(cid:3)

6.2. Convergence of the ﬂow away from a subset of codimension 4.
Theorem 1.4, except for the assertion involving the uniform convergence in the
case ρi → 0, now follows immediately:
Proof of Theorem 1.4. The theorem follows from Propositions 4.1 and 6.4

(cid:3)

Next we present the proof of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. By [BZ15b, Corollary 1.2], we have uniform convergence
dt → dT for t ր T . The function dT : M × M → [0,∞) is a pseudometric. Write
x ∼ y if d(x, y) = 0. Then (M, dT ) descends to a metric space (M∗ := M/ ∼, d∗T ).
Let q ∈ M. By the ﬁrst part of Theorem 1.4 (or Propositions 4.1 and 6.4), we
obtain that there is a sequence ti ր T such that (M, gti, q) converges to a pointed
singular space (X, d,R∗, g, q∞) with codimension 4 singularities, according to
some convergence scheme {(Ui, Vi, Φi)}∞i=1. It follows that (X, d) is isometric to
(M∗, d∗T ). So identify in the following (X, d) with (M∗, d∗T ) and view R∗ ⊂ M∗.
Let R ⊂ M be the preimage of R∗ under the canonical projection π : M → M∗ =
M/ ∼.
By looking at the construction of the convergence scheme {(Ui, Vi, Φi)}∞i=1, we
may assume that for all x ∈ R∗ we have Φi(π(x)) → x as i → ∞. Thus, by
Proposition 4.1(d) we have limi→∞ rRm(x, ti) = r∞Rm(x), where r∞Rm denotes the
curvature radius on X . Using forward pseudolocality, Proposition 3.2, we obtain
that the metric gt smoothly converges to some metric gT on R as t ր T and
rRm(x, T ) := limtրT rRm(x, t) exists for all x ∈ M.
Assume now that x ∈ R and y ∈ M such that x ∼ y. Then x = y, because for
t suﬃciently close to T we have dt(x, y) < rRm(x)/2 and the convergence gt → gT
is smooth on B(x, T, rRm(x, T )/2). So π|R : R → R∗ is a bijective map and
π∗g = gT . This ﬁnishes the proof of the theorem.
Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let x0 ∈ M be some basepoint, t∗i ր T a sequence and
consider the kernels

(cid:3)

Ki(x, t) := K(x0, t∗i ; x, t)

to the conjugate heat operator ∂t + △ − R. So for every ﬁxed t ∈ [0, T ) we have

Ki(x, t)dgt(x) = 1

and

− ∂tKi = △Ki − RKi.

We claim that there are uniform constants c > 0 and C < ∞ such that for any

t ∈ [0, T ) and large i we have

These bounds can be deduced using the reproduction formula

c(T − t)−n/2 < Ki(·, t) < C(T − t)−n/2.

the upper and lower heat kernel bounds for K(y, 1
2(T + t); x, t) from Proposi-
tion 3.4 and (6.7) applied at time 1
2 (T + t). By local parabolic regularity, we
obtain local bounds on higher covariant derivatives of Ki, which may depend
on space and time, but which are independent of i. So after passing to a sub-
sequence, we have smooth convergence Ki → u ∈ C∞(M × [0, T )) on compact
time-intervals. The limit u is a positive solution to the conjugate heat equation
−∂tu = △u − Ru and for all t ∈ [0, T ) we have

ˆM

u(x, t)dgt(x) = 1

and

c(T − t)−n/2 ≤ u(·, t) ≤ C(T − t)−n/2.

(6.8)

Write now
Ki(x, t) = (4π(t∗i − t))−n/2e−fi(x,t)

and u(x, t) = (4π(T − t))−n/2e−f (x,t).

Then fi → f smoothly on compact time-intervals and, by (6.8), f is uniformly
bounded from above and below on M × [0, T ). For any t ∈ [0, T ) we have

w(t) := W[gt, f (·, t), T − t] = lim

i→∞W[gt, fi(·, t), t∗i − t] ≤ 0.

Recall also that w(t) is non-decreasing in t. More speciﬁcally,

w′(t) = ˆM

So for any θ > 0 we have

2(T − t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) Ric(·, t) + ∇2f (·, t) −

We now use Theorem 1.4 (or Propositions 4.1 and 6.4) to conclude that (M, (T−
ti)−1, qi) converges to a pointed singular space (X , q∞) = (X, d,R, g, q∞) whose
singularities have codimension 4. Let {(Ui, Vi, Φi)}∞i=1 be a scheme for this con-
vergence. Consider now the functions f∗i (x) := f (Φi(x), ti), f∗i ∈ C∞(Ui). We
will show that, after passing to a subsequence, these functions limit to a smooth
function f∞ ∈ C∞(R) that satisﬁes the gradient Ricci soliton equation.

This question can be analyzed locally. So let x0 ∈ R and choose 0 < 2σ <
r∞Rm(x). Then for large i we have rRm(Φi(x0), ti) > σ(T − ti)1/2. Using backwards
pseudolocality, we ﬁnd that rRm(Φi(x0), ti) > εσ(T −ti)1/2 on P (Φi(x0), ti, εσ(T −

ti)1/2,−ε2σ2(T − ti)) for some uniform ε > 0. Using local parabolic derivative
estimates, we ﬁnd that the functions f∗∗i (x, t) := f (Φi(x), t + (T − ti)), deﬁned on
BX (x0, σ) × [−ε2σ2, 0] for large i, satisfy uniform derivative bounds. Thus, after
passing to a subsequence, these functions converge to a smooth function f∞ on
BX (x0, σ). If f∞ did not satisfy the gradient Ricci soliton equation, then, by the
uniform derivative estimates, the integrals in (6.9) would be bounded from below
by a constant that is independent of i (assuming θ = ε2σ2). This is however not
the case. So f∞ satisﬁes indeed (6.10).
(cid:3)

The Hamilton-Tian Conjecture follows now immediately.

Proof of Corollary 1.3. The Hamilton-Tian Conjecture follows from Theorem 1.2
and the upper bounds on the scalar curvature and the diameter as derived in
[ST08].
