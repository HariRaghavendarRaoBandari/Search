BETWEEN EXPERIENCED AND INEXPERIENCED ART

How do people look at art? Are there any diﬀerences between
how experienced and inexperienced art viewers look at a painting?
We approach these questions by analyzing and modeling eye move-
ment data from a cognitive art research experiment, where the eye
movements of twenty test subjects, ten experienced and ten inexperi-
enced art viewers, were recorded while they were looking at paintings.
Eye movements consist of stops of the gaze as well as jumps be-
tween the stops. Hence, the observed gaze stop locations can be
thought as a spatial point pattern, which can be modeled by a spatio-
temporal point process. We introduce some statistical tools to analyze
the spatio-temporal eye movement data, and compare the eye move-
ments of experienced and inexperienced art viewers. In addition, we
develop a stochastic model, which is rather simple but ﬁts quite well
to the eye movement data, to further investigate the diﬀerences be-
tween the two groups through functional summary statistics.

1. Introduction. Eye movements are outcomes of cognitive processes
in the human brain, and can be recorded with high spatial and tempo-
ral resolution by computerized eye trackers. Eye movements provide valu-
able information about cognitive processes [Duchowski, 2002, Rayner, 1998,
2009], and tracking of them is analyzed in a range of diﬀerent areas, such
as language and music reading [Rayner, 1998, Kinsler and Carpenter, 1995],
psychology [Findlay, 2009], and marketing research [Nagasawa, Yim, and
Hongo, 2005].

The ﬁrst measurements of eye movements were made in 1879 indepen-
dently by M. Lamare in France and Ewald Hering in Germany [Wade,
2010]. Both researchers used an acoustic approach, and noticed, much to
everyone’s surprise, that in reading text the gaze moves in jerks between

points of rest. These extremely rapid movements are called saccades. They
are essentially involuntary, so once a saccade starts it cannot be interrupted
[Findlay, 2009]. Thus researchers can predict saccade lengths from very few
observations early in the saccade [Komogartsev, Ryu, and Koh, 2009]. The
points of rest, periods in which the gaze is staying relatively still around a
location of the target space, are called ﬁxations [Barlow, 1952]. Eye move-
ments can thus be represented as an alternating sequence of ﬁxations and
saccades. In this paper we will mainly focus on sequences of ﬁxation loca-
tions and times in the target space, and call such a sequence of observations
a ﬁxation process. Our targets are pictures of paintings and the data consist
of recorded eye movements of subjects on the paintings. We will introduce
some new statistical tools and a model to analyze the ﬁxation process by
means of group comparisons.

The ﬁxation process is regarded as a spatio-temporal point process. We
are aware of only few studies that use point process methodology to an-
alyze ﬁxation processes. Barthelm´e, Trukenbrod, Engbert, and Wichmann
[2013] use inhomogeneous Poisson processes to model ﬁxation locations, and
Engbert, Trukenbrod, Barthelm´e, and Wichmann [2015] perform some pre-
liminary analysis of clustering of the ﬁxations by using inhomogeneous pair
correlation function. Furthermore, they construct a dynamic model for sac-
cade selection by discretizing the space.

We are interested in studying how people look at art. The ﬁrst such study
was carried out using two movie cameras by Buswell [1935]. His ﬁndings
indicated that much of the theory of how people look at art needed reformu-
lation. Another interesting eye movement study related to arts is brought
out by Locher [2006]. He developed a two-stage model for art viewing, where
the ﬁrst stage of viewing of a painting was to obtain a general view of its
structure and semantics. In Locher’s study, subjects describing a painting
orally while viewing it started to describe the painting only after a couple of
seconds after they had begun to look at it. At the second stage of the model
the viewer focuses on some interesting features, which are analysed from an
aesthetic point of view.

In this paper, we concentrate on comparing the ﬁxation process of inex-
perienced and experienced art viewers, novices and non-novices for short.
Already in his pioneering work Buswell [1935] compared the ﬁxation dura-
tions of 61 non-novices and 117 novices (originally ”art experts” and ”lay
persons”) by comparing the group averages based on the 25 ﬁrst ﬁxations. He
repeated the experiment for seven paintings, and in each case he concluded
that the non-novices made shorter ﬁxations than the novices. Nevertheless,
when comparing the ﬁxations in the areas of subdivided picture, he did

not report any major diﬀerences between the two groups. However, there
are some studies where some diﬀerences have been found. In Kristjanson
and Antes [1989] ten paintings were shown to a group of non-novices and a
group of novices (”artists” and ”non-artists” in the original paper). All the
subjects were familiar with three of the paintings (same for all subjects),
the non-novices group was familiar with another three paintings while the
remaining paintings were unknown to all subjects. The only statistically sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerence between the non-novice and novice groups found was that
non-novices made more ﬁxations on the parts of the paintings that were not
centers of interest when viewing unfamiliar paintings compared to novices.
The authors concluded that the non-novices made a more thorough inves-
tigation of all areas of the unfamiliar paintings than the novices. The ﬁnal
conclusion was that it is conceivable that the non-novices extract a diﬀerent
amount or diﬀerent kind of information during each ﬁxation, even though
the pattern of ﬁxations may vary little from the pattern of novices.

Vogt and Magnussen [2007] used eye movement patterns to investigate
how non-novices and novices (”artists” and ”artistically untrained people”
in the original paper) view art. Participants were shown realistic and ab-
stract works of art under two conditions: one asking them to free scan the
paintings, and the other asking them to memorize them. Participants’ eye
movements were tracked as they either looked at the images or tried to
memorize them, and their recall for the memorized images was recorded.
The researchers found no diﬀerences in the ﬁxation frequency or duration
between picture types for non-novices and novices. However, across the two
conditions, the novices had more short ﬁxations while free scanning the
works, and fewer long ﬁxations while trying to memorize. Non-novices fol-
lowed the opposite pattern. In addition, non-novices spend more time than
novices by scanning the areas which were not deﬁned as regions of interest.
There was no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the recall of the images
across groups, except that non-novices recalled abstract images better than
novices, and remembered more pictorial details.

Here, we investigate whether we can ﬁnd any diﬀerences between how non-
novices and novices view a particular painting by using a new set of tools to
study eye movements. As mentioned earlier, the ﬁxation process is described
by a spatio-temporal point process, and intensities of the point processes and
distributions of the ﬁxation and saccade durations are used to compare the
eye movements of novices and non-novices. We are mainly concentrating
on the eye movements of 20 subjects, 10 novices and 10 non-novices, on
the painting Koli landscape by Eero J¨arnefelt [Sundell, 1986] but give some
results based on the other ﬁve paintings as well. For example, we investigate

4

whether the ﬁxation duration distributions of the novice and non-novice
groups remain the same from painting to painting. Finally, based on the data
analysis we construct a rather simple stochastic model that further helps as
to describe the ﬁxation process and to investigate diﬀerences between the
non-novices and novices in terms of functional summary statistics.

The paper is organized as follows. The experimental set-up and the data
from the cognitive art research experiment as well as the results from the
preliminary data analysis are described in Section 2. In Section 3, we show
the results of a comparison of the two groups, novices and non-novices. A
stochastic model is constructed in Section 4, and it is used to make further
comparisons of the groups for the J¨arnefelt painting in Section 5. Finally, in
Section 6 we discuss the results.

2. Data and data analysis.

2.1. Art experiment. Twenty test subjects participated in an experi-
ment, where the task was to observe six pictures of paintings on a computer
screen, each during three minutes, and describe orally the mood in each
painting while their eye movements and voice were recorded. The paintings
can be seen in Figure 1. The eye movements were recorded by the SMI iView
XTMHi-Speed eye tracker with a temporal resolution of 500Hz. The resolu-
tion of the target screen was 1024 × 768 pixels and the distance between a
participant’s head and the screen was around 85 cm. A forehead rest was
used in order to avoid redundant movement of the head. The data were
collected by Pertti Saariluoma and Sari Kuuva (University of Jyv¨askyl¨a)
and Mar´ıa ´Alvarez Gil (University of Salamanca) with technical help from
Jarkko Hautala and Tuomo Kujala (University of Jyv¨askyl¨a). All subjects
were students at the University of Jyv¨askyl¨a at the time of the study. Ten
of the subjects were either art students (8) or students who had studied art
history and frequently visited art exhibitions (2). The remaining ten sub-
jects were students who did not have art as their major nor their hobby. We
call the participants in the ﬁrst group non-novices and participants in the
latter group novices. Five of the participants were men (three novices and
two non-novices) and 15 women (seven novices and eight non-novices).

In this article our main purpose is to introduce some new tools for eye
movement analysis. Therefore, instead of analyzing all the six paintings in
detail we concentrate mainly on the eye movements on one of the paintings,
namely the J¨arnefelt painting Koli landscape, shown in Figure 1(a). The
resolution of the image of the painting is 770 × 768 pixels, hence it does not
ﬁll the whole computer screen and there are white areas on both sides of
the painting. For some subjects, some of the ﬁxations were located in these

analysis. We will treat saccades going outside the image as missing values.

2.2. Data description. We ﬁrst look at the eye movement data as a whole
and later (Section 3) compare the eye movements of novices and non-novices.
An important way of describing the viewing of the painting is to look at a
smoothed plot of all ﬁxation locations of all subjects, which represents the
viewing foci of the painting. Technically, when describing the locations of
ﬁxations by a spatial point process this is an estimate of the intensity of the
ﬁxation process, marginalized over time. We use the R package spatstat for
the intensity estimation [Baddeley et al., 2015]. A chi-square test for quadrat
counts clearly rejects the hypothesis of constant intensity (p < 0.001). The
areas of the painting that have been visited most by the subjects are shown
in Figure 3 (left). We can see that the trunk of the main tree going down
almost the entire length of the painting and the top of the small tree next
to it seem to be the areas of particular interest in the painting. In Figure 3
(right) one can see the least visited areas, the edges of the painting in this
case.

The ﬁxation process varies a lot between subjects, and hence it is inter-
esting to look at some summary statistics for the data. The supplemental
article Ylitalo, S¨arkk¨a, and Guttorp [2016a] includes a table, which shows
the total number of ﬁxations and the number of short ﬁxations (less than
40 ms) inside the picture with means, medians and standard deviations of

ﬁxation durations for each subject. The number of ﬁxations during the three
minutes time period varies between 326 and 770, and the median ﬁxation
duration varies between 150 ms and 438 ms. The mean ﬁxation duration is
always greater than the median, indicating a right skewed distribution of
the ﬁxation duration.

Short ﬁxations are not included in our analysis because they are believed
to be microsaccades, or eye movements within a ﬁxation [Manor and Gor-
don, 2003]. The histogram on the left side of Figure 4 indicates that the
duration distribution may be a mixture of very short durations and regu-
lar ones. When excluding the short ﬁxations, the remaining durations seem
to follow a gamma distribution. The right panel shows a gamma quantile-
quantile plot [Wilk and Gnanadesikan, 1968] of the regular (longer than 40
ms) ﬁxation durations. The red line of slope 1 falls inside the simultaneous
conﬁdence band [Doksum and Sievers, 1976], indicating that the durations
can be described well by a gamma distribution.

As mentioned earlier, the complete eye movement process consists of ﬁx-
ations and saccades, the latter being the rapid movements between the ﬁxa-
tions. The supplemental article Ylitalo, S¨arkk¨a, and Guttorp [2016b] shows
summary statistics for saccade durations and saccade lengths, i.e., the dis-
tances between consecutive ﬁxation locations. The distribution of saccade
lengths as well as the distribution of saccade durations are skewed to the
right, and are also well described by gamma distributions. The temporal
dependence between ﬁxation durations is very weak, as judged by the auto-

correlation functions and ARIMA time series ﬁtting.

2.3. Temporal analysis. Art is considered to be a subjective ﬁeld. How
one views artwork is individually unique, and reﬂects one’s experience, knowl-
edge, preference, and emotions. According to Locher’s two-stage model [Locher,
2006], exploration of a picture starts with a global survey of the pictorial
ﬁeld in order to get an initial overall impression of the structural arrange-
ment and semantic meaning of the composition. The second phase of an
aesthetic episode consists of visual scrutiny or focal analysis of interesting
pictorial features detected initially to satisfy cognitive curiosity and to de-
velop aesthetic appreciation of the display. Some pioneering investigations
into visual exploratory behavior of paintings by Buswell [1935] and Yarbus
[1967], and subsequent studies on the informative details of an image by
Antes [1974] and Mackworth and Morandi [1967] revealed that observers fo-
cus their gaze on speciﬁc areas of the image, rather than in a random fashion.
The areas receiving high intensities of ﬁxations were interpreted as guiding
the observer’s interest in informative elements of the image [Henderson and
Hollingworth, 1999].

Since people do not look at all parts of the painting, but rather focus
on some features of interest, the ﬁxation process cannot be assumed to be
spatially stationary. Furthermore, the features people look at may vary in
time. To investigate the latter, we estimated the intensity surface of ﬁxa-
tion locations based on the ﬁxations of all subjects, and plotted residual
intensities in 30s intervals (Figure 5). The residual intensity is the diﬀerence

between the estimated intensity surface and the mean intensity surface of
the six intervals. The intensity in location x ∈ I, where I is the area of
the painting, is estimated using the edge-corrected kernel estimator (see e.g.
Gatrell, Bailey, Diggle, and Rowlingson [1996])

(1)

ˆλh(x) =

(cid:80)n
(cid:82)
i=1 h−2 K(h−1(x − xi))
I h−2K(h−1(x − u)) du

,

where xi, i = 1, ..., n, are the ﬁxation locations, h a bandwidth (a smooth-
ing parameter) and K a kernel function, here the standard two-dimensional
Gaussian density. The bandwidth for the mean intensity estimation is se-
lected by applying the cross-validation approach described in Diggle [1985]
and Berman and Diggle [1989] and that bandwidth (here 17) is the same for
all intervals.

One can notice in Figure 5 that during the ﬁrst 30s, the gaze is more con-
centrated on the tall pine tree on the left hand side of the painting and after
that more on the small tree in the middle than on average during the whole
three minutes time period. During the second and the third minutes ﬁxa-
tions are spread out a little more than during the ﬁrst minute. In addition,
during the last minute the areas which were of interest at the beginning (the
two trees) are now being avoided. Note that here we have only made some
visual observations. For a more formal comparison of intensity surfaces we
could use the test we introduce in Section 3 below.

We also investigate the diﬀerence in ﬁxation duration distributions be-
tween the diﬀerent 30s time intervals. Figure 6 shows a graphical way to
compare distributions, a shift function [Doksum and Sievers, 1976] deﬁned
as follows. If X has the cumulative distribution function F , written X ∼ F ,
and Y the cumulative distribution function G, Y ∼ G, the shift function is
deﬁned as

∆(x) = G−1(F (x)) − x,

and has the property that X + ∆(X) ∼ G. The idea of the shift function
is to compare two distributions based on how much one distribution func-
tion needs to be shifted in order to coincide with the other. In general, this
may depend on the abscissa at which the comparison is made. We have the
simplest case when the second distribution is simply the ﬁrst shifted by a
constant amount. The shift function is then just a horizontal line at the
level of the shift (in particular, if the distributions are the same, the shift
function is a horizontal line at the level zero). If a location-scale model is ap-
propriate, the shift function is a straight line with slope related to the scale
change. The shift function is easily estimated using empirical distribution
functions, and simultaneous conﬁdence intervals based on the distribution of

the intensity compared to the mean intensity surface; the more blue the color, the lower
the intensity.

the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic are given in Doksum and Sievers [1976].
If a horizontal line at level 0 falls inside the band, the two distributions
are statistically indistinguishable. The shift function estimates in Figure 6
represent the comparison of the second through the sixth 30s ﬁxation dis-
tributions to the ﬁrst 30s distribution. It seems that the later time intervals
tend to have slightly longer ﬁxations between about 200ms and 450ms than
the earlier intervals. This is also illustrated by the side-by-side box plots in
the lower right hand panel of the ﬁgure.

3. Comparison of novices and non-novices.

In the previous section
we introduced some tools to describe the ﬁxation process. Now these tools
are applied to compare the ﬁxation processes of novices and non-novices.
First, we compare the ﬁxation intensity surfaces of the two groups visually
and then, construct a test for more formal comparison. Second, we com-
pare the ﬁxation duration distributions in the two groups using shift plots.
Finally, we investigate whether the ﬁxation duration distributions change
within the two groups if the painting is replaced by another.

3.1. Visual comparison of intensity surfaces. To compare the spatial pat-
terns of ﬁxations, we ﬁrst estimate the overall intensity for each group by
using equation (1), see the top row in Figure 7. We see that both groups

concentrate on the middle part of the painting and do not look closely at the
edges, and that the ﬁxations of non-novices seem to be slightly more con-
centrated than the ﬁxations of novices. Non-novices look a lot at the large
pine and one of its branches (vertical alignment) while novices look at the
same branch of the tree but continue to the right of the branch (horizontal
alignment). We also plot the areas of the painting that are visited most (top
5% in yellow and top 1% in red) for each group (Figure 7, bottom row).
This veriﬁes the ﬁnding of non-novices’ interest in the vertical trunk while
novices have been concentrating more on the horizontal branch.

A more detailed investigation, where the time interval is divided into 30s
intervals (see supplemental article Ylitalo, S¨arkk¨a, and Guttorp [2016c]),
reveals that especially early on the non-novices are more concentrated on
the large tree and its branch than the novices. The gaze of novices starts
to spread out much earlier than the gaze of non-novices and novices have
more hot spots than non-novices. The gaze of non-novices mainly stays on
the large pine tree and in the end also on the small tree on the right side of
the large one, while novices investigate other areas of the painting as well.

3.2. Test for comparing two intensity surfaces.

In order to test whether
two intensity surfaces diﬀer signiﬁcantly from each other, i.e. whether the
subjects in the two groups have been looking at diﬀerent areas of the paint-
ing, we apply the method developed by Kelsall and Diggle [1995a,b]. They
considered a ratio of two kernel density estimates and used a Monte Carlo
test for testing if the ratio is constant, i.e. whether the kernel estimated in-
tensity surfaces can be considered similar. This ratio is used in epidemiology
to explore whether some diseased cases are randomly located among healthy
controls and is therefore, often called a relative risk function. The logarith-
mic relative risk function is deﬁned as ρ(x) = log(λ1(x)/λ2(x)), where λi’s
are computed using equation (1), and can reveal areas where the intensity
of ﬁxations diﬀers between novices and non-novices.

By conditioning on the observed number of ﬁxations, we may view the
ﬁxation locations of novices and non-novices as independent samples from
the densities f1(x) and f2(x), where

ˆfi(x) =

(cid:82)

ˆλi(x)
ˆλi(x)dx

,

I

for i = 1, 2. We can now deﬁne a logarithmic density ratio

(cid:82)
(cid:82)

I

where c = log(

I

r(x) = log

ˆf1(x)
ˆf2(x)

= ρ(x) − c,

ˆλ1(x)dx
ˆλ2(x)dx

) (see e.g. Wakeﬁeld, Kelsall, and Morris [2000],

Kelsall and Diggle [1995b]). We have

ˆr(x) = log

ˆf1(x)
ˆf2(x)

,

which contains all the information about the spatial variation in ρ(x).

According to Kelsall and Diggle [1995b], the choice of the kernel function
is not critical, but choosing the smoothing parameter h is. Furthermore, it is
not obvious whether one should use the same bandwidth for both densities
when computing the ratio. Kelsall and Diggle [1995b] suggest that if the
densities are expected to be nearly equal, the bandwidths should be equal
as well to reduce bias. They also warn that if the sample sizes are very
diﬀerent, one can get poor results when using the same bandwidth for both
samples. Furthermore, Bailey and Gatrell [1995] suggest that the kernel
estimate in the denominator should be deliberately oversmoothed (a larger

14

A.-K. YLITALO ET AL.

bandwidth should be used). In addition, Hazelton [2007] shows that edge
correction terms are not needed if a common bandwidth is used.

We test the null hypothesis that the intensity surfaces are equal, i.e. that
the logarithmic density ratio r(x) = 0, by the following Monte Carlo test
[Barnard, 1963]. Ten subjects were randomly selected from the twenty sub-
jects to form the novice group and the remaining ten subjects formed the
non-novice group. (Hence the possible dependence between the ﬁxation lo-
cations within a subject was taken into account.) By doing this random
grouping m times, we obtain m log-density surfaces ˆr1, . . . , ˆrm, under the
null hypothesis. As introduced by Kelsall and Diggle [1995b], we use the test
statistic

(cid:90)

I

Tj =

ˆrj(x)2dx,

j = 0, . . . , m.

The p-value is then p = k+1
m+1 , where k is the number of test statistics Tj
which are larger than or equal to the observed value of the test statistic, T0.
Since the number of ﬁxations vary quite a lot between the subjects, we
estimate the bandwidths separately for the two groups by using the cross-
validation method by Diggle [1985] and Berman and Diggle [1989] with Rip-
ley’s isotropic edge correction [Ripley, 1988]. The estimated bandwidth for
the novices was approximately 20 and for the non-novices 16. We obtained
T0 = 59604 and p = 0.108 after random grouping of subjects 10000 times.
This means that the diﬀerence between the intensity surfaces of novices and
non-novices is not statistically signiﬁcant even though there are some dis-
similarities in the intensities, see Figure 7. The largest diﬀerences between
the intensities of the two groups are near the edges of the painting, where
there are very few ﬁxations of either group.

We made the same comparisons for the other ﬁve paintings and ob-
tained similar results, see supplemental article Ylitalo, S¨arkk¨a, and Guttorp
[2016d]. None of the tests gave any signiﬁcant result, and Fisher’s combined
probability test resulted in p = 0.392 (χ2 = 12.685, df = 12). Therefore,
we did not ﬁnd any overall diﬀerences when comparing the intensities of
the two groups. However, it seems that the more abstract paintings could
reveal some diﬀerences between novices and non-novices, see results related
to Kandinsky’s painting in Ylitalo et al. [2016d].

3.3. Comparing duration distributions. To compare the ﬁxation duration
distributions of the novice and non-novice groups, we again look at the shift
plot, for the J¨arnefelt painting see Figure 8. Here, the novices have fewer
short ﬁxations (duration less than 125 ms), and more ﬁxations between
about 175 and 600 ms than non-novices. Similar results were found for the

remaining ﬁve paintings, see Ylitalo et al. [2016d]. This is in line with the
early ﬁndings of Buswell [1935], and may mean that novices more rarely only
glance a point on the painting but rather spend more time on each point
compared to non-novices.

3.4. Pairwise comparison of paintings. Since several paintings are avail-
able, we are also able to investigate whether the ﬁxation process is similar
for diﬀerent paintings, i.e. whether the ﬁxation process stays stable when
looking at paintings. We are particularly interested in whether we detect
any diﬀerences between the behavior in the novice and non-novice groups.
We started by comparing the J¨arnefelt painting and the painting Terrace at
Sainte-Adresse by Claude Monet (1867) shown in Figure 1(b) since both are
landscapes and hence similar to each other. The estimated intensity surface
of the ﬁxation locations for Monet’s painting is also shown separately for
novices and non-novices in Figure 9. The intensity surfaces of the two groups
look fairly similar, see also the formal test in Ylitalo et al. [2016d].

Since the pictures are completely diﬀerent, the intensity surfaces of ﬁx-
ations for the paintings are also diﬀerent and comparing them would be
meaningless. However, it is of interest to compare the ﬁxation duration dis-
tributions of novices and non-novices between two paintings in order to see
whether the way of looking at paintings remains stable between diﬀerent
paintings. The shift function comparisons of the duration distributions for
novices and non-novices are plotted in Figure 10 for the J¨arnefelt - Monet
pair. We can see that for non-novices there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence be-
tween the paintings, while for novices there are more ﬁxations that last

200-350 ms on the J¨arnefelt painting than on the Monet painting. We made
similar comparisons for the other pairs of paintings as well, see supplemental
article Ylitalo, S¨arkk¨a, and Guttorp [2016e]. Here, only the results based on
the comparisons of the ﬁxation duration distributions for the most similar
pairs of paintings, namely Suomi and Kandinsky which are abstract paint-
ings (see Figure 1(c) and (d)), and Poussin and Tammi which have people in
focus (see Figure 1(e) and (f)), are included. For novices, we see a diﬀerence
for each three pairs of paintings. For non-novices, however, we can only see a
clear diﬀerence for the Suomi - Kandinsky pair, but there is no diﬀerence for
the other two pairs of paintings. This indicates that the non-novices, being
used to looking at paintings, are more consistent in their ﬁxation durations
between paintings, but for novices, the duration of ﬁxations depends on the
painting.

4. Stochastic model. Above, we used intensity surfaces and shift plots
to compare the eye movements of novices and non-novices. Next, we will
construct a simple spatio-temporal model that describes the dynamics of
the ﬁxation process. We will ﬁt the model separately to the novice and
non-novice groups for the J¨arnefelt painting and see if we can ﬁnd some
further diﬀerences between the groups by comparing the ﬁtted models in
terms of functional summary statistics and their model based simultaneous
envelopes.

To build a spatio-temporal model for the ﬁxation process, we need to
model ﬁxation locations, ﬁxation durations, saccade durations and saccade
lengths. (Saccade durations are needed to ﬁll the whole three minutes time
period.) As building blocks we use the tools discussed in Section 2. Fixation
locations are modeled as a realization of a spatial point process, which is

characterized by its intensity function. Furthermore, appropriate distribu-
tions can be ﬁtted to the ﬁxation and saccade durations and for saccade
lengths. After having estimated the intensity surface and the distributions
mentioned above, we can simulate from the resulting model and compare
the behavior of the model to the behavior in the data, and ﬁnally compare
the models ﬁtted to the two groups.

A natural reference or null model for spatial point pattern data, locations
of ﬁxations in our case, is the homogeneous Poisson process, where the points
are located uniformly and independently of each other on the study area. In
our situation, however, only the more interesting parts of the painting are
visited, and we cannot assume that the ﬁnal set of locations of ﬁxations is
a realization of a homogeneous process. A homogeneous Poisson process is
therefore not a realistic reference process for the ﬁxation locations. Next, we
deﬁne our own reference model for the ﬁxation process.

Given an intensity surface, the ﬁrst ﬁxation location is drawn from the
probability distribution on the observation window by normalizing the in-
tensity to a bivariate distribution. The length l of the next saccade is drawn
from a saccade length distribution for the group in question. Then, the ex-
act location of the new ﬁxation is decided by taking a point at distance l
away from the current ﬁxation location according to the intensity surface.

Fig 11. Next ﬁxation location is chosen from the black circle at distance l from the current
ﬁxation xi according to the estimated intensity surface.

In other words, the new location is chosen from the conditional intensity of
points at the given distance from the current location, see Figure 11.

Concerning the temporal evolution, it seems natural to draw each ﬁxation

duration independently from the distribution of durations.

5. Model ﬁt and comparison between novices and non-novices
for the J¨arnefelt painting.
In what follows, we will ﬁrst give the partic-
ular choices of the distributions mentioned in the previous section, and intro-
duce some summary statistics that could be used to assess the goodness-of-ﬁt
of the ﬁtted models. Finally, we ﬁt the model to the data for the J¨arnefelt
painting, separately for novices and non-novices, simulate 200 realizations
of each process, and check the goodness-of-ﬁt of the ﬁtted models by com-
paring the summary statistics estimated from the data to those estimated
from the simulations.

5.1. Choice of distributions. The intensity surfaces of the ﬁxation loca-
tions are estimated separately for each group and the bandwidth is selected
by applying the cross-validation approach implemented in the R package
spatstat [Baddeley et al., 2015]. The same bandwidth is used for the data
and for the simulations. The ﬁrst location is drawn from the intensity sur-
face estimated from the locations of the ﬁrst ﬁxations of the subjects in the
group. Alternatively, the intensity surface estimated based on all the ﬁxation
locations in the group could be used. We believe that the choice of the ﬁrst

NoviceslSTOCHASTIC MODELING OF EYE MOVEMENTS

19

ﬁxation location is not crucial.

Given the summary statistics computed from the data (Section 2.2), an
appropriate distribution for the duration of ﬁxations and duration of sac-
cades is the gamma distribution. Therefore, we model the ﬁxation durations
by sampling from the estimated gamma distribution of ﬁxation durations
in the group. The duration of each saccade is modeled by drawing from the
common distribution of saccade durations estimated from all the subjects,
as saccades are involuntary, once started, and therefore not expected to vary
depending on viewing experience. The intensity surface, as well as the ﬁxa-
tion duration and saccade duration distributions, stay the same throughout
the observation period.

For saccade lengths we ﬁrst ﬁt a Gamma distribution separately for
novices and non-novices and then, use truncated versions of these distri-
butions in order to avoid jumps outside the painting. The truncation point
depends on the current location: if the process is at location xi, the longest
jump it can take is to the furthest corner of the painting. This distance is
called li,max and serves as the truncation point for the truncated gamma
distribution from which the next jump is sampled. We noticed, however,
that the truncated gamma distribution alone does not catch the long jumps
that the gaze makes when the person moves her/his attention to another
location. Therefore, we include such long jumps into the model and deﬁne
the distribution for saccade lengths to be a mixture of two distributions:
When the process is at location xi, the length of the next jump is sam-
pled from the uniform distribution U (li,max/2, li,max) with probability p and
from the truncated Gamma distribution with truncation point li,max with
probability 1− p. After some experimentation, we ﬁxed the probability p for
sampling the saccade length from the uniform distribution above to 0.2 for
both groups.

5.2. Summary statistics. To get some idea of how the gaze jumps be-
tween diﬀerent areas of the painting in the data and in the simulations, we
divide the painting into quarters and compute the transition frequencies be-
tween them. Each quarter is called a state and identiﬁed with numbers 1–4
(from upper left to lower right quarter).

In order to see how much of the painting is viewed, we use two functional
summary statistics, namely convex hull coverage and ball union coverage
deﬁned as follows. Let, as before, I represent the observation window and
xi ∈ I be the ith ﬁxation of the ﬁxation process {X(t)}. An ordered set of
nt ﬁxations up to a ﬁxed time t is denoted by x = {x1, . . . , xnt}. The convex

hull of this point set is

and the relative area of the convex hull is denoted by

(cid:40) 0

ACx(t) =

area(I)

if nt < 3
if nt ≥ 3.

This is called the convex hull coverage of the ﬁxation process. Hence the
convex hull coverage is computed every time a new ﬁxation appears.
Let b(xi, R) be a ball of ﬁxed radius R centered in a ﬁxation xi ∈ I. Deﬁne

and call

Ux(t) = {∪nt

i=1b(xi, R) ∩ W},

AUx(t) =

area(Ux(t))

the ball union coverage of the ﬁxation process.

In addition, to measure the total length of the distance the gaze has
moved, we use the scanpath length function [Noton and Stark, 1971], which
is the sum of the saccade lengths up to time t. Hence, the scanpath length
can be deﬁned as

nt−1(cid:88)

L(t) =

li1(ti+1 ≤ t),

i=1

where ti+1 is the time when the ﬁxation i + 1 at location xi+1 takes place
and li is the length of the jump just before that ﬁxation. That length is the
Euclidean distance between two successive ﬁxations, i.e. the length of the
saccade.

5.3. Model ﬁt. The estimated model based intensity surfaces for the
groups are diﬀerent, see Figure 12. As mentioned earlier, both groups look a
lot at the large pine tree and the top of the small tree next to it. The novice
group tends to follow the branch of the large tree while the non-novice group
follows the trunk.

The convex hull coverage, ball union coverage with disc radius 35 pixels,
and scanpath length for non-novices and novices are shown and compared
to the models in Figure 13. The 95 % simultaneous (rank) envelopes were
created by using the R package spptest [Myllym¨aki et al., 2013a,b]. Figure
13 shows that the coverage statistics based on the model describe the data

STOCHASTIC MODELING OF EYE MOVEMENTS

quite well. The model based scanpath length is, however, less variable and
somewhat shorter in the simulations than in the data. It seems that the
model is not able to catch all variation related to the scanpath length. In the
beginning (during the ﬁrst 30 seconds for novices and during the ﬁrst minute
for non-novices), the model describes the data well but later on, variation in
the data becomes too large to be caught by the model. One should also note
that the scanpath length is strongly aﬀected by the number of ﬁxations and
saccade lengths, which both vary quite a lot in our data, see supplemental
articles Ylitalo et al. [2016a] and Ylitalo et al. [2016b].

For both the novice data and the non-novice data, the estimated transition
probabilities between diﬀerent quarters of the painting indicate that the
model does an adequate job (Figure 14 and Figure 15). Recall that the
quarters of the painting are called states and numbered from 1 to 4 (from
upper left to lower right quarter).

The model seems to ﬁt quite well to the ﬁxation process for both groups.
The ﬁtted models are quite similar but also some diﬀerences can be found.
As can be seen in Figure 13, the model based coverage summaries are quite
similar for the two groups. However, the modeled gaze of non-novices seems
to move slightly more than the gaze of novices according to the scanpath
length (see Figure 13, bottom right plot). This is somewhat surprising, since
the intensity surface of non-novices seems to be more compact than the one
of novices, which would indicate that the gaze of non-novices takes shorter
jumps in smaller areas than the gaze of novices. However, ﬁxation durations
of novices are longer than the ones of non-novices in general, which means
that non-novices tend to make more jumps during the three minute period

compared to novices. Thus, it is possible that the gaze of non-novices makes
a larger number of short jumps than the gaze of novices which results in the
gaze traveling a longer path than the gaze of novices.

6. Conclusions and Discussion.

In this study we have analyzed eye
movement data from twenty subjects who had looked at six diﬀerent paint-
ings. We have been particularly interested in whether non-novices and novices
look at paintings in the same way, both when it comes to which parts of the
painting they look at and how long the gaze typically stays in one spot.
By regarding the ﬁxation process as a spatio-temporal point process and by
using a new set of tools we can study the diﬀerences from a slightly diﬀerent
perspective than what has been done earlier. Our main purpose has been to
see how useful our new approach is and therefore, we have mainly concen-
trated on one of the six paintings that we have had available, namely the
J¨arnefelt painting Koli landscape. However, some results based on the other
paintings are included.

By looking at the intensity surfaces of the point patterns formed by the
locations of ﬁxations we have been able to see some diﬀerences between the
eye movements of novices and non-novices on the Koli painting. The area
that is visited most is more concentrated and more stable in time for the
non-novice group than for the novice group. We also constructed a test to
compare the intensity surfaces of novices and non-novices. Even though the
observed diﬀerence was not statistically signiﬁcant, there was some indica-
tion that the intensities cannot be considered equal. By comparing ﬁxation
duration distributions instead of bare means we were able to see a clear dif-
ference between the two groups under study. Non-novices tend to have more
short ﬁxation durations than novices meaning that they may only glance
at some areas of the painting which novices do not tend to do. This was
conﬁrmed by the analysis based on the other paintings.

To have some idea whether the painting itself aﬀects how novices and
non-novices look at it we compared the ﬁxation processes of each group on
three pairs or paintings, J¨arnefelt - Monet, Suomi - Kandinsky, and Poussin -
Tammi. Intensity surface of ﬁxations vary of course from painting to painting
and it is not meaningful to compare them on diﬀerent paintings but it does
make sense to compare the duration distributions. An interesting observation
was that in the non-novice group the distribution of duration of ﬁxations is
more consistent from painting to painting than in the novice group.

Ideally, to be able to have a more detailed comparison of the eye move-
ments of novices and non-novices, we would like to be able to describe the
complete ﬁxation process on a painting, i.e. where, when and how long the

STOCHASTIC MODELING OF EYE MOVEMENTS

25

gaze of a person stays in diﬀerent parts of the painting. Therefore, we have
introduced a simple reference model for the ﬁxation process. The model is
a spatio-temporal point process model, where we used the ﬁxation intensity
and duration distributions estimated from the data. In order to restrict how
far the gaze usually jumps we also estimated the saccade length distribution
from the data. To mimic the tendency that after having stayed on one area
of the target painting for some time, the gaze jumps to another area on the
painting, the model suggests a long jump with some (small) probability p.
We ﬁtted the model to the non-novice and novice groups separately for
the eye movements on the J¨arnefelt painting and saw that the model ﬁts
quite well for both groups, except when measured by the scanpath length.
The structure of the ﬁxation process (described by our model) is similar in
nature for non-novices and novices. The model based simultaneous envelopes
for the functional summary statistics can be used like conﬁdence intervals
to compare the two groups. However, since the envelopes overlap, we were
not able to reveal any signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the groups based on
the model based summaries.

Our idea here was to ﬁnd a rather simple model that captures the most
important features of the ﬁxation process and the reference model is quite
good for this purpose. However, if the goal is to understand the complete
dynamics of the ﬁxation process, the model constructed here is not good
enough since it does not capture that the ﬁxation process is changing in
time. We noticed, for example, in Section 2 that both the intensity surface
and the ﬁxation duration distribution vary in time. Despite this we used the
same intensity surface and the same gamma distributions for the ﬁxation
durations and saccade lengths during the whole time period. We made some
experiments by using six intensity surfaces (for each 30 second interval) and
two distributions for saccade lengths (one for the ﬁrst 30 seconds and one
for the rest of the three minute time interval) in the reference model but
these modiﬁcations did not improve the goodness-of-ﬁt of the model.

One possible way to improve the model could be to take the order of
ﬁxations into account. The ﬁxation process could be regarded as a realization
of a sequential point process which can be used to access the non-stationarity
of the ﬁxation process. The ﬁrst author of this paper is currently working
on that issue (see preprint Penttinen and Ylitalo [2016]).

To conclude, our new set of tools allowed us to make more detailed com-
parisons between how novices and non-novices look at paintings than re-
ported in the literature. As far as we know such comparisons of ﬁxation
intensity surfaces, duration distributions and coverages have not been pre-
sented earlier in eye movement studies.
