Doppler shift generated by a moving diﬀraction grating under incidence by

polychromatic diﬀuse light

Kokou B. Dossou∗

We consider the spectral response of moving diﬀraction gratings, in which the incident light
extends over a broad angular range and where the diﬀracted light is observed from a speciﬁc angle.
We show that the dispersion relation between the frequency perceived by an observer who is looking
at a moving grating and the incident frequency can exhibit some unique features, such as a ﬂat
band (i.e., a local minimum). An observer can see the light diﬀracted into a non-specular diﬀraction
order from a multitude of incident light rays and the angle of incidence of each ray is frequency-
dependent; as a consequence, when the grating is moving, each incident ray experiences a Doppler
shift in frequency that depends on its angle of incidence. We ﬁnd that remarkable features appear
near a Wood anomaly where the angle of incidence, for a given diﬀraction angle, can change very
quickly with frequency. This means that light of multiple frequencies and incident from multiple
angles can be mixed by the motion of the grating into the same diﬀracted ray and their frequencies
can be compressed into a narrower range. The existence of a ﬂat band means that a moving grating
can be used as a device to increase the intensity of the perceived diﬀracted light due to spectral
compression. The properties of a grating in motion in sunlight can also be relevant to the study of
naturally occurring gratings which are typically in oscillatory motion.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The Doppler shift has been successfully used to un-
derstand the frequency shift generated by moving re-
ﬂectors, such as a mirror [1], a moving grating [2] or
a grating acousto-optic modulator [3].
In many appli-
cations, diﬀraction gratings are typically operated at a
ﬁxed incidence angle (and a ﬁxed non-specular diﬀrac-
tion order). For instance grating spectrometers are used
to split a polychromatic ray (at a given incidence angle)
into several diﬀracted monochromatic rays which propa-
gate in diﬀerent directions; the angle of the propagation
direction depends on the frequency and can change very
quickly with the frequency, near a Wood anomaly.

Here we are interested in the problem of an observer
who is watching a diﬀracted ray from a moving grat-
ing (at a ﬁxed non-specular diﬀraction order). Since at
any given time the observer’s viewing angle has a ﬁxed
value, this problem can be seen as a reciprocal situation
of the case where a single polychromatic ray is incident
on a grating: here the observer can only see the diﬀracted
ﬁelds which are propagating in a given direction; the cor-
responding incident rays are coming from several diﬀer-
ent directions and are merged into a single diﬀracted ray
(see Fig. 1). The incidence angle of each incident ray is
frequency-dependent and, again, can change rapidly with
frequencies near a Wood anomaly. In practice, polychro-
matic continuous diﬀuse light (e.g., direct sunlight, dif-
fuse skylight) can readily provide a light ray with the
required incidence angle.

The Doppler shift depends on the angle of incidence
and the fact that the angle of incidence is frequency-
dependent implies that, when the grating is moving,
there is variability in the frequency shift experienced by
each incident frequency. The main purpose of the current
work is to investigate the properties of the Doppler shift
created by a moving grating under a frequency-dependent
incidence angle. The angular dispersion of the incidence
angle with respect to the frequency can be very high near
a Wood anomaly. As a consequence, the Doppler disper-
sion relation (i.e., the observed frequency as a function of
the incident frequency) can be expected to exhibit some
interesting non-linear behavior.
In particular, we will
look for conditions which lead to the existence of a ﬂat
band. When a band of incident frequencies inside a ﬂat
band is Doppler-shifted into a narrower band of observed
frequencies (spectral compression), from energy conser-
vation, we can expect that the observer will perceive an
increased intensity of the light diﬀracted by a moving
grating compared to the light diﬀracted by a stationary
grating.

The properties of a grating in motion in polychromatic
diﬀuse light can also be relevant to the study of natural
diﬀraction gratings as they seem to be placed on surfaces
designed to undergo oscillatory motion, for instance, the
wings of butterﬂies, leaves and ﬂowers of plants (wind-
induced oscillations). Many species also display rapid cy-
cles of movement of iridescent colors in ritualized dances
during courtship, e.g., bird-of-paradise [4] and peacock
spider [5]. Since the work of Robert Hooke [6] and Isaac
Newton [7], it is known that the iridescent colors from
some animals and plant species are generated by grating
structures, although the functional purpose of the oscil-
lations of natural gratings is still not well understood [8].

For the numerical simulation of moving gratings, we
will consider a grating geometry based on the periodic
nanostructure found in the wing scales of a Morpho

rhetenor butterﬂy. Our choice is motived by several
reasons. First the blue nanostructure of the Morpho
rhetenor are one of the most studied butterﬂy nanos-
tructures. This nanostructure can also be modelled as
a one-dimensional diﬀraction grating, leading to a sub-
stantial reduction of the computer simulation time and
memory usage. The Morpho rhetenor is also well-known
for its ability to produce a bright blue color; for instance,
in 1864 the English naturalist and explorer Henry Bates
wrote that a Morpho rhetenor butterﬂy ﬂapping its wings
in the sunlight can produce a blue ﬂash that “is visible
a quarter of a mile oﬀ” [9] and it has been reported that
this ﬂash can even be seen from a low-ﬂying aircraft [10,
see p. 218]. The relatively long range of visibility of the
Morpho butterﬂy wing ﬂap is consistent with our pre-
diction that the motion of a grating under sunlight can
induce a strong reﬂection due to the spectral compres-
sion and so the grating model for the Morpho rhetenor
nanostructure is an appropriate example for a case study.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section II, we
will analyze the angular dispersion of the incidence angle
with respect to frequency. The properties of the Doppler
shift produced by a grating in a translational motion and
a rotational motion will be investigated, respectively, in
Sections III and IV. Some numerical simulation results
will be presented in Section V and a conclusion section
will follow.

frequency ν if p 6= 0 (see Eq. (2)).

II. ANGULAR DISPERSION AT A FIXED

ANGLE OF DIFFRACTION

As a model problem, we consider a one-dimensional
diﬀraction grating as illustrated in Fig. 2. The grating
is periodic in the x-direction, with a period Λ, invari-
ant with respect to y and has a ﬁnite thickness in the
z-direction. The analysis of the angular dependence is

based on the grating equation

sin φp = sin φ0 +

(1)

where λ is the wavelength, p is a given diﬀraction order,
φ0 and φp are respectively the angle of incidence and
the angle of diﬀraction. We consider an incidence by a
continuous polychromatic diﬀuse light with an observer
who is looking at the grating at an observation angle
φobs. For a given incident ﬁeld with a wavelength λ, the
observer can see the light diﬀracted into the order p when
φp = φobs and the corresponding angle of incidence φ0
can be obtained from the grating equation Eq. (1):

φ0 = arcsin(cid:18)sin φp −

ν (cid:19) ,

(2)

where ν = c/λ is the frequency of the incident light, c
being the speed of light in vacuum. The symbol Bp is
deﬁned as

Bp =

The angular dispersion of the angle of incidence with
respect to the frequency ν can be derived from Eq. (2):

since sin φp−Bp/ν = sin φp−p λ/Λ = sin φ0 (see Eq. (1)).
The incidence angle Eq. (2) exists as a real number φ0 ∈
R if and only if −1 ≤ sin φp − p λ/Λ ≤ 1, i.e., if p > 0,
we have

λ ≤ λcut = (1 + sin φp)

The curve in Fig. 3 shows the proﬁle of the cut-oﬀ fre-
quency νcut as the angle of diﬀraction φp varies (for the
case p > 0). The angle of incidence at the cut-oﬀ fre-
quency is either φ0 = −π/2 if p > 0 or φ0 = π/2 if p < 0.
This shows that the angular dispersion Eq. (4) can be
arbitrarily large when ν is near the cut-oﬀ frequency νcut
deﬁned in Eq. (5) or Eq. (6). The following asymptotic
relation is valid for a frequency ν near νcut:

φ0 ≈ −sign(p)  π

(7)

where sign(p) = 1 if p > 0 and sign(p) = −1 if p < 0. The
square root function in Eq. (7) shows that the incidence
angle φ0 can vary rapidly with frequencies ν near νcut.
The relation Eq. (7) can be derived from Eq. (2) by ﬁrst
writing

and since φ0 = −sign(p) π/2 at the cut-oﬀ frequency,
Eq. (2) gives sin φp − Bp/νcut = −sign(p), so that we
have

2 −√2 x for small values of x, we
lation arcsin (1 − x) ≈ π
immediately get Eq. (7) from Eq. (2) and Eq. (10).

non-specular orders. Note that we will consider in Sec-
tion IVIV D, some particular cases where the condition
Eq. (11) can be relaxed so that φp can be diﬀerent from
φobs.

Translational motion of the grating will create a
Doppler shift and we want to compute the frequency shift
perceived by the observer. The reﬂection of a wave from
a moving surface involves a double Doppler shift. First
at incidence, the point S can be seen as a receiver moving
at the velocity V = V z, the velocity component in the
direction of the light source is given by V cos φ0 so that
the Doppler shift (in the classical limit where |V /c| ≪ 1)
is

∆ν0 = ν

V cos φ0

(12)

On reﬂection, the point S can be seen as a light source
moving at the speed V ; the velocity component in the ob-
server’s direction is given by V cos φp so that the Doppler
shift is:

III. FREQUENCY SHIFTING BY A GRATING

IN A TRANSLATIONAL MOTION

We assume that the grating is in a translational motion
with a velocity parallel to the normal direction z. As
illustrated in Fig. 1, an observer, who is looking at a
point S on the grating at a viewing angle φobs, can see the
light diﬀracted into an order p if the angle of diﬀraction
is equal to the observation angle:

φp = φobs,

(11)

and the corresponding angle of incidence φ0 is given
by Eq. (2). The angle φ0 is frequency-dependent for

∆ν = ∆ν0 + ∆νp = ν

V (cos φ0 + cos φp)

c

,

(14)

and the observed frequency can be written as

ν ′ = ν + ∆ν = ν + ν A (cos φ0 + cos φp) ,

(15)

with

A =

V
c

.

(16)

The value of cos φ0 can be obtained by using the grating
equation Eq. (1):

cos φ0 =q1 − sin2 φ0 =s1 −(cid:18)sin φp −

Bp

ν (cid:19)2

.(17)

For the specular order p = 0, we have φ0 = φp and
Eq. (14) takes the form ∆ν = −2 ν A cos φ0, which is
the formula of the Doppler shift created by a ﬂat mirror
in a translational motion [1, p. 74]. The Doppler shift
Eq. (14) is also in agreement with the formula for the
frequency shift by a moving grating in [2, see Eq. (1)];
note that the grating considered in [2] was moving along
the x-direction and so the cosine function in Eq. (14) is
replaced by the sine function in [2].

There are some important diﬀerences between the
Doppler shift from a specular order and a non-specular
order. For the case of specular reﬂection, the angle of
incidence φ0 is equal to φobs, i.e., independent of the fre-
quency, and there is no cut-oﬀ frequency; in particular
the Doppler shift scales linearly with the frequency. In
a contrast, with a non-specular reﬂection, the angle of
incidence depends on the frequency and the diﬀracted

ﬁeld can propagate only for frequencies above a cut-oﬀ
frequency νcut; this means that, for an illumination by
a diﬀuse polychromatic light, the Doppler shift for non-
specular orders can display some unique and interesting
behaviors.

For a non-specular order p, the application of the
asymptotic relation Eq. (7) together with cos(π/2− x) =
sin x ≈ x, leads to the following approximation of cos φ0:

cos φ0 ≈ p2 |Bp| (ν − νcut)

νcut

,

(18)

so that the observed frequency Eq. (15) admits the
asymptotic expression for frequencies ν near νcut:

ν ′ ≈ ν + ν A cos φp + Aq2 |Bp| (ν − νcut),

(19)

where the estimate ν/νcut ≈ 1 is used for the factor of
the square root function. The presence of the square
root function in Eq. (19) indicates that the observed fre-
quency ν ′ changes rapidly when the incident frequency ν
varies near the cut-oﬀ νcut. In fact near νcut, the deriva-

tive of the shift ∆ν = 2 Ap2 |Bp| (ν − νcut) with respect

to the frequency ν dominates that of the linear terms
ν(1+V cos φp/c) and so the square root term determines
the sign of the slope of the Doppler dispersion relation
ν ′ = ν + ∆ν near a cut-oﬀ frequency. If V > 0, i.e., the
grating is moving toward the observer, the observed fre-
quency ν ′ increases monotonically with the frequency ν
(see Fig. 4 (a)). As illustrated in Fig. 4 (b), if V < 0, i.e.,
the grating is moving away from the observer, the asymp-
totic function Eq. (19) is a decreasing function when the
incident frequency ν is close enough to the cut-oﬀ νcut,
reaches a minimum and start increasing as the contribu-
tion of the linear term dominates when ν is far enough
from νcut. A detailed analysis of the radiated power for
frequencies near the minimum will be carried out in the
next section (for the case of a rotating grating) and will
not be repeated here as the results for a rotational motion
and a translational motion are very similar.

We note that if the grating is moving horizontally in-
stead of vertically then the observed frequency Eq. (15)
takes the form ν ′ = ν + ν A (sin φ0 + sin φp) as in [2]
and the asymptotic expression Eq. (19) becomes ν ′ ≈
ν + ν A sin φp + A (ν − |Bp| (ν − νcut)), since we have
sin φ0 = p1 − cos2 φ0 ≈ 1 − (cos2 φ0)/2. We can con-
clude that the observed frequency does not have a ﬂat
band since the square root term does not appear in the
asymptotic expression.

FIG. 4. Typical proﬁles of the non-specular Doppler disper-
sion relation Eq. (15) near a cut-oﬀ. The velocity V is respec-
tively positive and negative for the panels (a) and (b).

For a given diﬀraction order p, the diﬀracted wave will
also be rotating at an angular speed Ωp = dφp/dt, the
value of which can be obtained by diﬀerentiating Eq. (1).
The time-derivative of the grating equation Eq. (1), at
ﬁxed frequency, leads to the following angular momentum
conservation relation:

Ωp cos φp = Ω0 cos φ0,

(20)

so the angular velocity Ωp can be expressed in term of
Ω0 as

Ωp =

cos φ0
cos φp

Ω0.

(21)

We now apply a treatment similar to the one presented in
Section III, in order to ﬁnd the Doppler-shifted frequency
perceived by an observer watching the point S = (xS, 0)
on the grating interface z = 0. At incidence, the point
S can be seen as a receiver moving at the speed V0 =
−xS Ω0 z, the velocity component in the direction of the
light source is given by V0 cos φ0 so that the Doppler shift
is

∆ν0 = ν

V0 cos φ0

c

xS Ω0 cos φ0

c

.

(22)

Note that the minus sign in the expressionV0 = −xS Ω0 z
comes from the fact that when Ω0 > 0, a point S on the
left of the rotation axis moves upward while it moves
downward on the right side. At reﬂection, since the
diﬀracted ﬁeld is rotating at the angular speed Ωp, the
point S can be seen as a light source moving at the speed
Vp = −xS Ωp z, the component of Vp in the observer’s
direction is Vp cos φp so that the Doppler shift is:

We now suppose that the grating depicted in Fig. 1
is rotating around the y-axis. For a given incident ray,
as the grating is rotating, the angle of incidence φ0 of
the ray will change with an angular velocity denoted Ω0.

For the specular order p = 0, Eq. (24) takes the form
∆ν = −2 ν xS Ω0 cos φ0/c, which is the formula of the
Doppler shift created by a rotating ﬂat mirror. By
applying the angular momentum relation Eq. (20), we
can verify that Eq. (24) also takes the form ∆ν =

−2 ν xS Ω0 cos φ0/c, for non-specular orders. However,
for a non-specular order, the angle of incidence φ0 is
frequency-dependent and a cut-oﬀ exists; again, this
means that for a rotating grating illuminated by a dif-
fuse polychromatic light, the wave diﬀracted into a non-
specular order can display some non-trivial Doppler eﬀect
which will be studied at the next section.

A. Asymptotics of the frequency shift

An asymptotic treatment can provide some useful in-
sight into the physics of a moving grating in a polychro-
matic diﬀuse light. From Eq. (24) and the angular mo-
mentum relation Eq. (20), the observed frequency can be
written as

ν ′ = ν + ∆ν = ν + 2 ν A cos φ0,

(25)

with

A = −xS Ω0

c

.

(26)

By repeating the derivation for the asymptotic approxi-
mation Eq. (19), we can obtain the following asymptotic
expression of the observed frequency Eq. (25)

ν ′ ≈ ν + 2 Aq2 |Bp| (ν − νcut).

(27)

Numerical tests have shown that the asymptotic ap-
proximation Eq. (27) accurately reﬂects the behavior of
the Doppler dispersion relation Eq. (25) near a cut-oﬀ.
Accordingly we now carry out an analytic investigation of
Eq. (25) based on the asymptotic Eq. (27). If A > 0, the
observed frequency ν ′ increases monotonically with the
frequency ν (see Fig. 4 (a)). As illustrated in Fig. 4 (b),
if A < 0, the asymptotic function Eq. (27) is a decreasing
function when the incident frequency ν is close enough
to the cut-oﬀ νcut. We can verify that the asymptotic
function reaches a minimum when ν takes the value

νmin ≈ νcut + 2 A2 |Bp|,

(28)

and the corresponding observed frequency is

ν ′

min ≈ νmin + 2 Aq2 |Bp| (νmin − νcut) ≈ νcut − 2 A2|Bp|.

(29)

We note that the cut-oﬀ frequency νcut is the average
of ν ′
min and νmin. With the parameters considered in
this work, the frequency width (νmin − νcut) ≈ 2 A2 |Bp|
is very small compared to νmin or νcut ∈ [|Bp|/2,|Bp|]
(see Eqs. (5) and (6)). As an illustration, if the velocity
of the point S is V = 10 m/s, then we have (νmin −
νcut)/νcut ≤ 4 A2 = 4 (V /c)2 = 4.4×10−15. We will show
in Section IVIV D that a larger value for the parameter
A can be possible (see Eq. (44)) and this leads to an
increased value of the ratio (νmin − νcut)/νcut. The cut-
oﬀ frequency curve in Fig. 3 can also be relevant to the
frequencies νmin and ν ′

min when they are close to νcut.

B. Diﬀraction eﬃciency for frequencies ν near νmin

For scattering problems, the diﬀraction eﬃciency

ep = |ρ2

p| cos φp
cos φ0

(30)

into an order p is a quantity of interest and it needs to be
suﬃciently high in order to have a physically detectable
diﬀracted light. The symbol ρp in Eq. (30) is the diﬀrac-
tion coeﬃcient into the order p. For a stationary grating,
the diﬀraction eﬃciency is usually deﬁned for each fre-
quency. However with a rotating grating, the incident
frequencies can be Doppler-shifted in a non-uniform way
(especially inside a ﬂat band), and so it can be useful to
characterize the diﬀraction eﬃciency in terms of integrals
of the radiated powers over a given frequency band.

For frequencies ν in the vicinity of νmin, the asymptotic
function Eq. (27) can be replaced by its second order
Taylor series:

ν ′ ≈

(ν − νmin)2
8 A2 |Bp|

+ ν ′

min,

(31)

which can also be written as (see Eq. (28)):

ν ′ ≈

(ν − νmin)2
4 (νmin − νcut)

+ ν ′

min.

(32)

The parabolic approximation Eq. (32) shows that a
frequency band centered on νmin and of width W ≪
2 (νmin − νcut), i.e., ν ∈ [νmin − W/2, νmin + W/2], will
Doppler-shifted into the band ν ′ ∈ [ν ′
min +W ′], with
W ′ = W 2/(16 (νmin−νcut)). The ratio of the bandwidths
W and W ′ is:

min, ν ′

The energy ﬂow carried through the upper interface of
a grating unit cell by an incident plane wave with in-
tensity I is proportional to (I cos φ0) and the energy
ﬂow of the diﬀracted wave of order p is proportional
to (I |ρ2
p| cos φp). For incidence by plane waves with a
frequency ν in the band [νmin − W/2, νmin + W/2], the
normalized total energies radiated by the incident waves
and diﬀracted waves are respectively

(35)

If we assume that the width W is small enough so that
the integrals Eqs. (34) and (35) can be evaluated by the
midpoint numerical integration formula, we then have

E0 ≈ W I cos φ0,
Ep ≈ W I |ρ2

p| cos φp,

(36)
(37)

where φ0 = φ0(νmin), I = I(νmin), ρp = ρp(νmin).

For the case of a rotating grating, at a given time t,
the assumption can be made that the power E ′
p radiated
by a diﬀracted ﬁeld over the Doppler-shifted frequency
band [ν ′
min + W ′] is same as the power Ep radiated
by a stationary grating:

min, ν ′

E ′
p = Ep ≈ W I |ρ2

p| cos φp.

(38)

We could deﬁne an eﬀective diﬀraction eﬃciency as the
ratio of the diﬀracted power E ′
p by the incident power over
min + W ′]. But we intend to
min, ν ′
the frequency band [ν ′
compare the reﬂectance of a moving grating against that
of a perfectly reﬂecting mirror (both have same size), as
any reﬂector with an eﬀective reﬂectance equal or higher
than that of a perfect mirror can be expected to produce
exceptionally bright reﬂected light. Accordingly, we will
compare E ′
p to the maximum incident power ﬂow (i.e.,
cos φ0 = 1) for frequencies ν ′ ∈ [ν ′

C. Visual range of a moving grating

The visual range of a reﬂector (i.e., the maximum dis-
tance at which the reﬂector can be seen) can also be
used to characterize the strength of a reﬂected radiation.
Indeed the reﬂectivity of the Morpho rhetenor butter-
ﬂy is often described in term of a distance where it can
be seen [9, 10]. Here we assume that a perfect mirror
is observed at a distance equal to its visual range, and
by using a simpliﬁed but realistic model we will identify
conditions under which the diﬀracted light from a mov-
ing can also be seen at the same distance. We note that,
during daytime, the background radiation from the sky
or the sun is the main limiting factor for the visual range.

The power ratio Eq. (40) takes the value D′

in theory, this means that the moving grating can re-

FIG. 5. Diﬀracted intensity I(φ) obtained with the Fraun-
hofer diﬀraction formula Eq. (42) for the angles of diﬀraction
φp ∈ {0◦, 60◦, 89.9◦, 89.99◦}. The dashed curve is the in-
tensity I(0) under a normal incidence (I(0) is the maximum
intensity at a given distance R).

is rotating the light will then appear as a sudden bright
ﬂash.

In order to gain some qualitative insight, let us assume
that the reﬂected ﬁelds are monochromatic plane waves
emerging from a ﬁnite grating of length L. If the grating
is conceptualized as an aperture of width L (the interface
is located at z = 0 with x ∈ [−L/2, L/2]), the ﬁeld at a
point (x, y) = (R sin φ, R cos φ) can be calculated using
the Fraunhofer diﬀraction formula (far-ﬁeld approxima-
tion) [11, see Eq. (5)], [12]:

where I0 is the intensity of the plane wave at the aperture
interface. The intensity curves are plotted in Fig. 5 (red
continuous curves) for the angles of diﬀraction φp = 0◦,
φp = 60◦, φp = 89.9◦ and φp = 89.99◦. For the nu-
merical simulation in Fig. 5, the aperture of length is
set to L = 200 µm (as a one dimensional model of the
scales of Morpho rhetenor butterﬂies which are typically
75×200µm in size [13]) and the incident wavelength is set
to λ = 500 nm (blue light). The horizontal dashed lines
in Fig. 5 represent the intensity level I(0) = I0 L2/(λ R)
which is the maximum value of I(φ) for given values of
I0 and R (the maximum then occurs at a normal an-
gle of propagation φp = 0 for φ = 0). For each of the
panels in Fig. 5, the power ﬂow at the grating interface
from the ﬁeld associated with the red continuous curve
is four times that of the ﬁeld associated with the dashed
line (or the intensity I0 in Eq. (42) is set, respectively
for the continuous and dashed curves, to I0 = IA and
I0 = IB such that IA = 4 IB/ cos φp). So if R is the visual
range of a perfect reﬂector, the portion of the continu-
ous curve which is above the dashed curve, corresponds
to the directions where the ﬁeld radiated by the grating
can be seen beyond the visual range of a perfect reﬂec-

tor. We note that for the high grazing angle of diﬀraction
φp = 89.99◦, the intensity IA = 4 IB/ cos φp is very large
compared to IB and if the power ﬂow associated with
the red continuous curve is six time smaller (instead of
four times larger) than the power ﬂow associated with the
dashed line, i.e., IA = IB/(6 cos φp), the peak intensity
of the red continuous curve will still be above the dashed
line. So for grazing angles of diﬀraction, a diﬀracted light
can still be visible beyond the visual range of a perfect
reﬂector even if the power ratio D′
p is a small fraction of
one.

In practice, when a photodetector (e.g., eye) is used
to detect the reﬂected light from the grating, it can col-
lect the diﬀracted radiations (with an intensity above a
threshold) from the moving grating over a range of angles
A + ∆ν ′].
and frequencies (φp, ν) ∈ [φA, φA + ∆φp]× [ν ′
We assume that the photodetector is operated at a dis-
tance equal to the visual range of a perfect reﬂector
and so it can only detect a reﬂected light from the
grating if the intensity is higher or equal to that of a
perfect reﬂector. For an angle φp ∈ [φA, φA + ∆φp],
the spectrally compressed radiation appears over a band
[ν ′ ∈ [ν ′
min(φp) + W ′] and the detector can col-
lect the radiated energy from this band if it is a part of
A + ∆ν ′]. This is illustrated in Fig. 6, where the
[ν ′
A, ν ′
red continuous curve (for ν ′
min(φp)) and the blue dashed
curve (for ν ′
min(φp)+W ′) represent respectively the lower
and upper edges of the region where the detector can re-
ceive a signal from the moving grating.

min(φp), ν ′

The actual detection will also depend on the proper-
ties of the detector. For instance, since the grating is
rotating, the detector will be exposed to the bright light
for only a ﬁnite time duration and a detection may not
happen if the duration is too short for the detector. The
exposure duration also depends on the angular velocity
of the grating and the distance between the grating and
the detector. We can assume that a duration of a few
milliseconds can be enough as the duration speciﬁcations
of common photographic ﬂashes are typically in the or-
der of milliseconds. The Morpho butterﬂies ﬂap their

7

wings slowly and this should allow suﬃcient exposure
time within a few hundred of meters.

D. Cases where the angle of diﬀraction and the

angle of observation are diﬀerent

So far, we have assumed that the angle of diﬀraction
is equal to the observation angle (see Eq. (11)), although
the spreading wavefront, from the ﬁeld diﬀracted by a
grating of ﬁnite size, means that the light diﬀracted into
an order p can also be seen at an observation angle φobs
which is not necessarily equal to the angle of diﬀraction
φp. But in general we expect the brightest light to occur
when the diﬀracted light is pointing directly toward the
observer, and so it can be reasonable to assume, in prac-
tice, that φp is equal φobs in such situations. However a
notable exception to this rule can be the case of a grazing
angle of diﬀraction. Indeed, at a grazing angle of diﬀrac-
tion φp, the angular spread has an asymmetric proﬁle
and even the peak intensity (for observation at a ﬁxed
distance from the grating) can occur at a viewing angle
φobs diﬀerent from φp. For instance in Fig. 5, the peak
intensity for the grazing angle of diﬀraction φp = 89.9◦
appears at an angle φ = 87.54◦ and it has deviated from
the angle of diﬀraction φp by 2.36◦.

When φp is diﬀerent from φobs, the derivation leading
to Eq. (23) can be modiﬁed as follows: At reﬂection,
the point S can be seen as a light source moving at the
speed Vp = −xS Ωp z and the velocity component in the
observer’s direction is given by Vp cos φobs so that the
corresponding Doppler shift is:

xS Ωp cos φobs

xS Ω0 cos φ0 cos φobs

,(43)

c

= −ν

∆νp = −ν
and the frequency shift can still be written in the form
Eq. (25) if the deﬁnition Eq. (26) of the parameter A is
changed to:

c cos φp

A = −

xS Ω0

2 c (cid:18)1 +

cos φobs

cos φp (cid:19) .

(44)

Since the denominator term cos φp in Eq. (44) can be very
small at a grazing angle of diﬀraction φp, the absolute
value of the parameter A in Eq. (44) can be much higher
when φp is diﬀerent from φobs (with |φp| > |φobs|) than
when φp is equal to φobs. This can result in a stronger
Doppler shift. We also note that although Eq. (21) shows
that the angular velocity Ωp of a diﬀraction order at a
grazing angle of diﬀraction φp can be much higher than
Ω0, the linear velocity Vp = −xS Ωp z has a vertical di-
rection, which is almost perpendicular to the direction
of view of an observer when φp = φobs, resulting in a
smaller contribution to the Doppler shift than when φobs
is allowed to deviate from φp (toward the normal direc-
tion).

The results in this section can also be relevant to
multi-level micro/nanostructures such as butterﬂy wing

scales [14]. Each scale can be large enough to be modelled
as a nanostructured diﬀraction grating. The scales are in
turn arranged as a microstructured array which covers a
butterﬂy wing. In the far ﬁeld, constructive interference
between the scale scatterers can occur in other directions
than the original direction of the diﬀraction orders of the
individual scales, i.e., φp can be diﬀerent from φobs.

FIG. 7. The panels (a) and (b) show a unit cell of gratings
with, respectively, uniform alternating lamellae and apodized
alternating lamellae.

V. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

For the numerical simulations, we use the two grat-
ing geometries shown in Fig. 7. They are multilayer
gratings consisting of alternating lamellae attached to
a ridge structure. The refractive index of the lamellae
is n = 1.56 + 0.06 i (chitin) and they are surrounded
by air. The grating periods in the x and z directions
are dx = 746 nm and dz = 207 nm. The values of the
lamella length L0 and thickness h are L0 = 308 nm and
h = 62 nm. The thickness of the ridge is hR = 60 nm. For
the grating in Fig. 7 (b), a linear apodization is applied
to the length of the top 7 lamellae: Lm = L0 − 40 m,
for m ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 7}. The diﬀraction problem can be
solved numerically using the ﬁnite element method pre-
sented in [15] or a one-dimensional version of the ﬁnite
element-based modal method described in [16].

The grating in Fig. 7 (b) models the nanostructures
found in Morpho rhetenor wing scales [17, see Fig. 9].
This grating can be seen as an apodized (or tapered)
version of the one in Fig. 7(a). Apodization is a tech-
nique where the strength of a grating is slowly reduced
over a transition region, near an output or input end.
The proﬁle of the Morpho rhetenor grating has also some

8

similarity with structures consisting of a regular pho-
tonic crystal whose interface is corrugated or indented.
For instance with a photonic crystal consisting of lattice
of rods, the corrugation can be introduced by removing
some rods from the interface layer [18] or changing the
cylinder radius in the interface layer [19]. Such struc-
tures, sometimes referred to as photonic crystal gratings,
can combine the properties of photonic crystals (e.g.,
high reﬂectance or existence of surface modes inside a
band-gap) and diﬀraction gratings (e.g., eﬃcient scatter-
ing into higher diﬀraction orders) to deliver some inter-
esting diﬀraction properties. We will compare the scat-
tering properties of the two gratings in order to identify
some possible advantages for the use of apodization in
the nanostructures of Morpho butterﬂies.

FIG. 8. The sub-ﬁgures (a) and (b) represent the total
reﬂectance curves from the gratings shown respectively in
Fig. 7 (a) and (b). The red continuous curves and the blue
dashed curves correspond respectively to incidence by Hy-
polarized and Ey-polarized plane waves. The angle of inci-
dence is normal.

The total reﬂectance of the two gratings is shown in
Fig. 8, for normal incidence by Hy-polarized (red con-
tinuous curves) and Ey-polarized (blue dashed curves)
plane waves. We can observe in Fig. 8 (a) that the
non-apodized grating has a high reﬂectance band λ ∈
[400 nm, 510 nm]. The apodized grating can also re-
ﬂect strongly the ultraviolet radiations in the wavelength
range λ ∈ [340 nm, 400 nm]. We have noticed that the
apodized grating reduces substantially the reﬂection into
the specular order (this can be beneﬁcial to the re-
ﬂectance into higher diﬀraction orders). For instance the
diﬀraction eﬃciency e0 into the specular order is lower
than 0.1% for λ ∈ [400 nm, 500 nm] for both polariza-
tions. With the untapered grating, the diﬀraction eﬃ-

ciency e0 can reach 5% and 8% respectively for the Hy
and Ey-polarizations, over the same wavelength band.

Figure 9 shows that the orders p = −1, 2, 3 can have
a cut-oﬀ in the wavelength range λ ∈ [400 nm, 510 nm]
where the gratings can diﬀract strongly light from the
visible spectrum. Here we will carry out a numerical
simulation for the order p = 3, because its cut-oﬀ wave-
length at a grazing angle φobs occurs within the band
λ ∈ [400 nm, 510 nm]. For instance, when the angle of
diﬀraction is set to φp = 89◦, the cut-oﬀ wavelength of
the diﬀraction orders p=1, 2, 3 and 4 are respectively λcut
= 1491.89 nm, 745.943 nm, 497.295 nm and 372.972 nm.
The order p = 4 can be relevant for a study of the scat-
tering in the ultraviolet band.

The Doppler dispersion curves perceived by an ob-
server watching a point S on the grating interface are
shown in Fig. 10. For the numerical calculation, the lin-
ear velocity of the point S is set to V = −10 m/s, along
the direction z. This velocity V is supposed to be ap-
proximately in the same order of magnitude as the wing
movement of a butterﬂy in ﬂight. Figure 10(a) shows the
observed frequency from the specular order p = 0 (or a
moving ﬂat reﬂector). A specular order does not have a
cut-oﬀ frequency and so the parameter νcut can have an
arbitrary value; the choice of an arbitrary value for νcut
(or φ0) does not have any visually noticeable impact on
the shape of the curve in Fig. 10(a) since, from Eq. (15),
we have ν ′−ν ′
cut = (ν−νcut) (1+2 A cos φ0) ≈ (ν−νcut),
as |A| = |V /c| = 3.333 × 10−8 ≪ 1.

FIG. 9. The plots of the cut-oﬀ wavelength λcut (or cut-oﬀ
frequency νcut) in Eqs. (5) and (6) as a function of the angle
of diﬀraction φp, for the diﬀraction orders p = ±1, ±2, 3, 4.

Figures 10(b) and (c) show the perceived frequency,
from the diﬀracted order p = 3, respectively, under a
translational motion (see Eq. (15)) and under a rota-
tional motion with φ3 = φobs. Both curves exhibit a ﬂat
band where the Doppler eﬀect can be expected to am-
plify the perceived illumination. Note that in the case
of a translational movement, the frequency shift at the
cut-oﬀ frequency νcut is not zero, accordingly the shifted
frequency ν ′
cut = νcut (1 + V cos φ3/c) is used in the la-
bel (ν ′− ν ′
cut) for the vertical axis in Fig. 10(b) (a similar
rule is also applied to Fig. 10(a)). The value of the cut-oﬀ

9

frequency νcut depends on the diﬀraction angle φp (see
Eqs. (5)-(6) and Fig. 3), but the asymptotic approxima-
tions Eqs. (19) and (27) shows that, near the cut-oﬀ, the
shape of the Doppler dispersion curves in Fig. 10(b) and
(c) is almost independent from φp. The non-linear ef-
fect from the Doppler shift is stronger in Fig. 10(c) than
in Fig. 10(b), as the minimum frequency occurs further
away from the cut-oﬀ. Indeed, with Fig. 10(c) we have
νmin − νcut ≈ 2 A2 B3 = 2.68 (see Eq. (28)) and we can
verify that we get νmin − νcut ≈ A2 B3/2 = 0.670 Hz
with Fig. 10(b). The frequency separation (νmin − νcut)
is four times larger in Fig. 10(c) than in Fig. 10(b) be-
cause the square root term in the asymptotic approxima-
tion Eq. (27) for a rotational motion is multiplied by 2 A
while it is only multiplied by A in the asymptotic relation
Eq. (19) for a translational motion.

FIG. 10. The panel (a) shows a Doppler dispersion curve
from a ﬂat mirror under a translational motion (specular or-
der). The panels (b), (c) and (d) show respectively the non-
specular Doppler dispersion curves (order p = 3) from a grat-
ing under a translational motion, under a rotational motion
with φp = φobs and under a rotational motion with φp 6= φobs.

We can estimate the incidence angle φ0 at the fre-
quency νmin in Figs. 10(c) and (d) by substituting the
relation (νmin − νcut) ≈ 2 A2 B3 into the approximate
expression Eq. (7): φ0 ≈ − (π/2 − 2 |A| B3/νcut). For
φp ∈ [0, π/2[, we have 1 ≤ |Bp|/νcut < 2 (see Eqs. (5)),
so that (2 |A| B3/νcut) ∈ [2 |A|, 4 |A|]. We have |A| =
3.333 × 10−8 for Fig. 10(c), and this means that the an-
gle of incidence φ0 is less than 1.34 × 10−7 rad. (or less
than 7.64× 10−5◦
) from the right angle −π/2 when φp is
in the interval [0, π/2[. For an illustration based on the
parameters of Fig. 10(c), when φ3 is set to φ3 = 60◦,
we have νcut = 646.52 THz (or λcut = 464.018 nm),
(νmin − νcut) = 2.681 Hz; the angle of incidence at νmin
is φ0 = −89.999993 and the absolute value of the diﬀrac-
tion coeﬃcient ρ3 is very small at such high grazing angle
of incidence: ρ3 = 1.914 × 10−7 (from the apodized grat-
ing, with Hy-polarization). The value of the frequency
bandwidth W ′
in Eq. (41) is W ′ = 8.99 × 10−28 Hz

in order to obtain W ′, the incident bandwidth
and,
W = 1.96 × 10−13 Hz is compressed by a factor fp =
W/W ′ = 4/(|ρ2
3| cos φ3) = 2.184 × 1014 (see Eqs. (33)
and Eq. (41)). The bandwidth W ′ is very small com-
pared to the frequency νmin and its physical signiﬁcance
is uncertain. We can obtain much larger values with a
grazing angle of diﬀraction.

As pointed out in Section IVIV D, with a grazing an-
gle of diﬀraction φp,
it can be reasonable to consider
situations where the angle of diﬀraction φp is diﬀerent
from the angle of observation φobs. The interference
between neighboring scales of a butterﬂy wing can fur-
ther increase this angular deviation (for example most
of the non-evanescent diﬀraction orders of the scale lat-
tice will propagate in directions which deviate away from
the grazing direction). However we do not have a sim-
ple formula for evaluating such a deviation, and for an
illustration purpose, the value of the angular deviation is
set arbitrarily to 30◦ in this work (the main observations
will still hold for other non-zero deviation values). The
Doppler dispersion curve in Fig. 10(d) is obtained by us-
ing φ3 = 89.99◦ and φobs = φ3−30◦ = 59.99◦. We can see
that, in Fig. 10(d), the Doppler frequency shift is stronger
near the cut-oﬀ frequency than in Figs. 10(b) and (c) (in
Fig. 10(d) the frequency is in megahertz unit MHz). This
is due to the fact that the parameter A for Fig. 10(d) is
given by Eq. (44), i.e., A = −4.777×10−5, and it is about
1433 times larger than the value of the parameter A
(from Eqs. (16) and (26)) used in Figs. 10(b) and (c), i.e.,
A = −3.333×10−8. For the results in Fig. 10(d), the sep-
aration of the angle of incidence φ0 from −π/2 at the fre-
quency νmin is (φ0 + π/2) ≈ 2 |A| B3/νcut = 0.00019 rad
(or 0.0109◦) and it is much higher than the largest possi-
ble value in Fig. 10(c). As shown in Table I, the diﬀrac-
tion coeﬃcient ρ3 at νmin and the frequency bandwidth
W ′ in Eq. (41) are also larger at grazing angles of diﬀrac-
tion. Actually, from the results of Section IVIV C (espe-
cially the case φp = 89.99◦ in Fig. 5), we can expect that,
at high grazing angles of diﬀraction, the moving grating
can diﬀract a brighter light over a frequency band with
a width substantially larger than the values of W ′ in Ta-
ble I.

Since a grazing angle of diﬀraction φp (with φp 6= φobs)
can produce a stronger Doppler shift and a more favor-
able angle of incidence φ0 near the frequency νmin, it can
be desirable to use a diﬀraction grating which can de-
liver a relatively high diﬀraction eﬃciency ep when φp
is close to a right angle. For an example, Fig. 11 shows
the diﬀraction eﬃciency e3 of the untapered and tapered
gratings when the angle of diﬀraction is set to φ3 = 89◦.
Near the cut-oﬀ, the diﬀraction eﬃciency e3 of the ta-
pered grating is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the unta-
pered grating. The diﬀraction eﬃciency of the untapered
grating into the Hy-polarization is lower than 2 × 10−5
over the interval λ ∈ [495 nm, 497.295 nm] and it is at
least 100 times smaller than the eﬃciency of the tapered
grating into the Hy-polarization. For Ey-polarization,

at grazing angles of diﬀraction. The diﬀraction coeﬃcient ρ3
at νmin corresponds to an incidence by a Hy-polarized plane
wave over the apodized grating.

the diﬀraction eﬃciency of the tapered grating is about
5 times higher than the diﬀraction eﬃciency of the unta-
pered grating, over the interval λ ∈ [495 nm, 497.295 nm].
We have observed a similar superior behavior of the ta-
pered grating at other grazing angles and this shows that
the apodized grating is well-suited for the purpose of fre-
quency shifting at grazing angles of diﬀraction.

FIG. 11. Diﬀraction eﬃciency for the order p = 3 at an
angle of diﬀraction φ3 = 89◦. The panels (a) and (b) display
the diﬀraction eﬃciency e3 of, respectively, the gratings in
Figs. 7(a) and (b). The notations for the curves are same as
in Fig. 8.

VI. CONCLUSION

A light ray emerging from a point S on a grating, illu-
minated by a polychromatic diﬀuse light, can be seen as
a superposition of the diﬀracted ﬁelds from a multitude
of incident rays which are converging toward the point
S. For a given non-specular diﬀraction order p, the angle

of incidence of each incident ray is frequency-dependent
and so, as the grating moves, each incident ray (and its
diﬀracted ray) can experience a diﬀerent Doppler eﬀect.
The most dramatic Doppler eﬀect occurs near a Wood
anomaly, where the Doppler dispersion curve from a re-
ceding point S can exhibit a ﬂat band. The incident
frequencies inside a ﬂat band can be Doppler-shifted into
a narrower band of perceived frequencies (spectral com-
pression). From the principle of energy conservation, the
perceived light from the compressed frequency band can
be brighter than the light diﬀracted by a stationary grat-
ing or even brighter than the light reﬂected by a perfect
passive reﬂector with a reﬂectance of 100% (since the
spectral compression factor can be arbitrarily large).

be attributed to a spectral compression mechanism. Al-
though this can be possible according to our theoretical
results, a proper answer to this question can require fur-
ther research (e.g., a direct observation) and can be the
subject of a future work. Finally, although we have con-
sidered the simpliﬁed model of a one-dimensional grating,
with the incident and diﬀracted rays lying in a plane per-
pendicular to the grating grooves, our results can still
hold for more general grating geometries, as they are
mainly based on the strong angular dispersion near a
Wood anomaly.

In particular, this means that a moving grating, under
the sunlight, can be seen as a kind of a super reﬂector.
Our work also leads to the question as to whether the
intense blue ﬂash, which can be perceived when the Mor-
pho rhetenor butterﬂy is ﬂying under the sunlight, can
