ABSTRACT

We study the fragmentation of the most nearby high line-mass ﬁlament, the integral shaped ﬁlament (ISF) in the Orion A molecular
cloud. We have observed a 1.6 pc long section of the ISF with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 3 mm
continuum emission, at a resolution of ∼3′′ (1 200 AU). We identify from the region 40 dense cores with masses on the order of a
solar mass. The nearest neighbour separation distribution of the cores does not show a preferred fragmentation scale; the frequency of
short separations increases down to our resolution limit. We apply a two-point correlation analysis on the dense core separations and
show that the cores are signiﬁcantly grouped at separations below ∼17 000 AU and strongly grouped below ∼6 000 AU. In addition,
the two-point correlation function indicates periodic grouping of the cores into groups of ∼30 000 AU in size, separated by ∼55 000
AU. The groups coincide with dust column density peaks detected by Herschel. These results suggest a two-mode fragmentation in
which the maternal ﬁlament periodically fragments into groups of dense cores. The strong increase of separations below 6 000 AU
may be related to the regime of signiﬁcant core-to-core interactions. We also ﬁnd that the protostars in the northern ISF are grouped
at separations below ∼17 000 AU. The stars with disks do not show signiﬁcant grouping in the ALMA-covered region. This suggests
that the grouping of dense cores is partially retained over the protostar lifetime, but not over the lifetime of stars with disks. This is
in agreement with protostars being ejected from the maternal ﬁlament by the slingshot mechanism, a model recently proposed for
the ISF by Stutz & Gould. The separation distributions of the dense cores and protostars may also provide an evolutionary tracer of
ﬁlament fragmentation.

1. Introduction

Filamentary structures are fundamental building blocks of the
molecular clouds of the interstellar medium (ISM), mani-
festing themselves over wide ranges of sizes (∼0.1-100 pc),
masses (∼1-105 M⊙), and line-masses (.1 000 M⊙ pc−1) (e.g.,
Bally et al. 1987; Hacar et al. 2013; Alves de Oliveira et al.
2014; Kainulainen et al. 2013, 2016; Abreu-Vicente et al. 2016).
Especially, high line-mass ﬁlaments that have average line-
masses of several hundreds of M⊙ pc−1 contain large enough
mass reservoirs to give birth to high-mass stars and star
clusters (e.g., Pillai et al. 2006; Beuther et al. 2010, 2015a;
Henning et al. 2010; Schneider et al. 2012; Kainulainen et al.
2013; Stutz & Gould 2015; Contreras et al. 2016). The physics
governing their evolution may be radically diﬀerent from those
of low-mass ﬁlaments, especially due to their strong global
gravitational potential that may crucially aﬀect their evolution
(Stutz & Gould 2015). This makes understanding the fragmen-
tation and gravitational collapse of high line-mass ﬁlaments im-
portant for Galactic-scale star formation.

The main obstacle in studying the fragmentation of high
line-mass ﬁlaments is the observational challenge. High line-
mass ﬁlaments show fragmentation down to (at least) &1 500
AU scales (e.g., Takahashi et al. 2013; Teixeira et al. 2015) and

can be several parsecs long. This means that building a complete
view of their structure requires high resolution mapping over a
large area. Coupling the gas structure with star formation also
requires an accurate census of the young (proto-) stellar popu-
lation of the cloud; this limits the possible targets to distances
closer than ∼1 kpc where such a census can be attained (e.g.,
Evans et al. 2009; Gutermuth et al. 2011; Megeath et al. 2012;
Stutz et al. 2013; Megeath et al. 2016).

Currently, the above requirements limit the number of pos-
sible targets to exactly one: the ”integral-shaped ﬁlament” (ISF;
e.g., Bally et al. 1987; Peterson & Megeath 2008) in the Orion A
molecular cloud. At the distance of 420 pc (e.g., Schlaﬂy et al.
2014), Orion A is the most nearby high-mass star-forming site.
The ISF, located in the northern part of the cloud, is an ∼8
pc long structure with the line-mass of 385 × (d/pc)3/8 M⊙
pc−1 from 0.05 pc < d < 8.5 pc of projected separation
from the ﬁlament ridge (Stutz & Gould 2015). Importantly, the
young stellar population of Orion A is well characterised with
Spitzer (Megeath et al. 2012) and Herschel (the Herschel Orion
Protostar Survey, HOPS; Furlan et al. 2016). Combined, these
properties make the ISF an outstanding, and currently unique,
region in which to study the physics of how high line-mass ﬁla-
mentary gas fragments into (high- and low-mass) protostars.

While the Orion A cloud has been a target of a myriad of
studies (see Fig. 1 in Meingast et al. 2016), the sensitivity and
resolution of the interferometer arrays have only recently en-
abled detailed fragmentation studies of the ISF. Teixeira et al.
(2015) and Takahashi et al. (2013) have analysed fragmentation
in sub-parsec-sized sections of the ISF in ∼1 600 AU resolu-
tion (for studies in lower spatial resolution, see, e.g., Bally et al.
1987; Johnstone & Bally 1999; Chini et al. 1997; Stutz & Gould
2015). These observations have established evidence of quasi-
periodic fragment separations and hierarchical fragmentation in
the ﬁlament. However, the relatively small areas covered by the
surveys have hampered the statistical analyses of their fragment
distributions. Similarly, no work so far has directly linked the
distribution statistics of fragments to those of the young stellar
population in the ISF.

We report in this paper the most sensitive fragmentation
study of a high line-mass ﬁlament to date, based on our ALMA
interferometer study of the ISF and the census of the young stel-
lar population derived by HOPS. Our mapping more than dou-
bles the area of the ISF studied previously in a similar resolu-
tion, also reaching higher sensitivity. Our speciﬁc goals in this
paper are to determine the fragmentation length scales of the ﬁla-
ment, to look for preferential fragmentation scales and grouping
of fragments, and to establish the relationship of the fragmenta-
tion scales to the distribution of the young stellar population in
the ISF.

2. Observations and methods

We used the ALMA interferometer during Cycle 2 to observe the
northern part of the ISF at 3 mm continuum emission and C18O
line emission (ESO Project ID 2013.1.01114.S, PI Kainulainen).
In this paper we only use the continuum emission data. Both
the 12-m and the 7-m (Atacama Compact Array; ACA) arrays
were employed. The 7-m array observations were conducted on
16th August 2014 and the 12-m array observations in a com-
pact conﬁguration on 16th January 2015. We covered a region
∼3 × 11′ (∼0.37 × 1.34 pc) in size in OMC-2 and OMC-3 with
mosaicing observations. The footprints of the 12-m and 7-m ar-
rays are shown in Fig. 1. During the observations, three of the
four correlator sidebands, each 2 GHz wide, were set to central
frequencies of 107.29217 GHz, 96.97848 GHz, and 98.97848
GHz. The fourth sideband was set to the frequency of the C18O
line at 109.749042 GHz. The relevant observational parameters
are listed in Table 1.

During the 12-m array observations, J0423-0120 and Uranus
were observed in the beginning of the measurement set for band-
bass and ﬂux calibration, respectively. J0517-0520 was observed
every ∼10 min during the science observations for phase cali-
bration. A similar sequence was employed during the 7-m array
observations, using J0607-0834 for bandbass calibration, Uranus
or J0423-013 for ﬂux and amplitude calibration, and J0541-0541
for phase calibration.

Both the 7-m and 12-m array data were calibrated and im-
aged using the casa version 4.5.0. The 12-m array data were
calibrated using the ALMA calibration pipeline (part of casa
4.5.0). The 7-m data were calibrated using the calibration scripts
prepared by the ALMA Regional Center experts; these are in-
cluded in the standard data delivery and they available in the
archive with the data.

We imaged the 7-m and 12-m array data both separately and
simultaneously using the clean task of casa. Prior to cleaning,
the relative weights of the 7-m and 12-m array visibility data
were adjusted with the casa task statwt. We excluded from the
cleaning the channels at the edges of the bands and the channels
coinciding with prominent emission lines. The total bandwidth
used in the imaging was 11.1 GHz (including two polarizations).
During cleaning, we used the ‘natural’ weighting scheme.
We ﬁrst ran the clean task without any masking of emission;
the resulting image of this ﬁrst cleaning was used to make the
cleaning mask; this was done by setting boxes around signiﬁcant
emission structures in the cleaned map. The cleaning was then
repeated with this mask, yielding the ﬁnal, cleaned map. This
procedure was repeated for 7-m array and 12-m array separately,
and also for the two arrays together. The ﬁnal maps are shown
in Fig. 2. The ﬁnal synthesised beam size of the combined 7-
m and 12-m array map is 3.′′75 × 2.′′27 (∼1 600 AU × 950 AU)
and the beam position angle 71◦. The root-mean-square (rms)
noise measured from an approximately emission free area is 0.23
mJy beam−1. We use this combined map in the remainder of this
paper and refer to it as the ALMA map.

We also employ in this work the column density map of
the Orion A molecular cloud derived from Herschel far-infrared
emission observations by Stutz & Kainulainen (2015). The sec-
tion of the map covering the ISF is shown in Fig. 1. The map has
the spatial resolution of FWHM = 18′′ (7 600 AU). We refer to
Stutz & Kainulainen (2015) for the details of the map.

Finally, we also use the catalog of Spitzer-identiﬁed proto-
stars and stars with disks from the HOPS survey (Megeath et al.
2012 for the disks and Furlan et al. 2016 for the protostars). The
protostars and stars with disks are shown in Fig. 1.

2.1. Identiﬁcationofdensecores

To study the spatial distribution of dense cores in the ALMA
map, we ﬁrst need to identify such objects. Generally, identi-
fying “cores” from column density maps is an ill-deﬁned prob-
lem, because there is no common standard for what exactly con-
stitutes “a core”. Consequently, diﬀerent approaches undoubt-
edly result in somewhat diﬀerent results (e.g., Smith et al. 2008;
Kainulainen et al. 2009; Beaumont et al. 2013). Here, our em-
phasis is in taking the advantage of the high resolution of the
ALMA data, and hence, in identifying structures that are cen-
trally concentrated at scales a few times the beamsize (i.e.,
.3 000-4 000 AU). The ALMA data recover structures also at
larger spatial scales, up to ∼20 000 AU, thanks to the inclusion of
the ACA array. Since the ISF shows signiﬁcant extended struc-
tures (e.g., Fig 1), this results in a varying background for the
compact structures. Also, some regions of the map clearly con-
tain high surface densities of local maxima. These properties
are suited to a technique based on 2-dimensional model ﬁtting
(as opposed to segmentation). Finally, we also wish to adopt a
well-documented and publicly available algorithm that will be
straightforward to use in future studies.

With the above considerations, we chose to use the imple-
mentation of gaussclumps in the starlink/cupid package ver-

sion 2.01. gaussclumps identiﬁes cores by ﬁtting 2-dimensional
Gaussians at the locations deﬁned by the highest pixel values in
the map. Prior to ﬁtting, a background is subtracted from the map
using a median ﬁlter. After the peak identiﬁcation and the ﬁtting
of the Gaussian proﬁle, the proﬁle is subtracted from the map
and the residual map is used to search for the next object. The
most important parameters of the algorithm are the threshold
(GaussClumps.Thresh in cupid) deﬁning the minimum accept-
able value for the peak of the ﬁtted Gaussian function and the
width of the ﬁltering function that is used to subtract the back-
ground. We chose to use the threshold three times the rms noise
calculated from an emission free region in the ALMA map, i.e.,
0.23 mJy beam−1. The ﬁlter width for the background subtrac-
tion was chosen to be 10′′, keeping in mind that we here want
to concentrate on detection of objects at scales smaller than a
few times the beamsize (.4 000 AU). This restricts the reason-
able choices of the background to roughly 9′′-15′′ (3-5 times
the beamsize). We experimented with diﬀerent ﬁlter widths and
found that between 7.5′′-15′′ the choice of the width does not

Stutzki & Guesten (1990); see the cupid manual for the minute
diﬀerences between the cupid implementation and the original version.

change the conclusions based on the two-point correlation func-
tion (see Appendix A).

Running gaussclumps resulted in detection of 43 objects
from the ALMA map. The objects are listed in Table 2, together
with their intensities, integrated ﬂuxes, and sizes (shown in Fig.
3). 23 of the objects coincide with a HOPS protostar and 3 with
a HOPS star with a disk. The HOPS sources were considered to
be coincident with the ALMA objects if their location was closer
than 2′′ to the centroid of the ALMA source.

Three compact objects detected by ALMA coincide with
stars with disks. The median lifetime (∼age) of stars with disks
is about 2 Myr (Evans et al. 2009), and therefore, the sources
that coincide with disks may not be coeval with the current frag-
mentation episode of the ﬁlament. To take this into account, we
remove from the identiﬁed 3 mm objects those that coincide with
the known stars with disks. The remaining 40 objects identiﬁed
from the ALMA 3 mm data are considered to be dense cores.
We note that these three objects could also be misclassiﬁed pro-
tostars. It is possible that a protostar is viewed close-to face-on
and the disk emission dominates the observed luminosity, caus-
ing misclassiﬁcation. 18 of the cores do not coincide with proto-
stars and are considered to be starless cores.

We give rough estimates for the masses of the ALMA-

detected cores using the equation

where Fν is the total integrated ﬂux, d is the distance, Bν(T ) is
the Planck function at the temperature of T , and κν is the mass

absorption coeﬃcient. For the temperature, we adopt 20 K (see
Li et al. 2013 for gas temperature measurements from NH3). We
calculate the mass absorption coeﬃcient from the expression
κν = 0.1(ν/1000 GHz)β cm2 g−1, where β is taken to be 1.5
(e.g., Sadavoy et al. 2016). This expression assumes the gas-to-
dust ratio of 100. The resulting mass absorption coeﬃcient is

3. Results

3.1. StructureoftheOMC-2/3at1000AUresolution

The ALMA map reveals intricate details within the OMC-2/3
region (Fig. 3). Most structures identiﬁed in the previous stud-
ies at ∼10′′ resolution (Mezger et al. 1990; Chini et al. 1997;
Johnstone & Bally 1999), and in the Herschel data at ∼18′′ reso-

lution (Fig. 1; Stutz & Kainulainen 2015) are resolved into mul-
tiple sub-structures. Some of the sub-structures are ﬁlamentary.
In the following, we brieﬂy describe the morphology as revealed
by the ALMA map beyond the previous studies. We follow
the designations of Mezger et al. (1990) and Chini et al. (1997)
(shown in Fig. 1), proceeding from north to south.

MMS 7: The source is single peaked at the resolution of the
ALMA map (as already indicated by the 4′′ resolution data of
Takahashi et al. 2013 at 1300 µm). We detect a previously unde-

tected compact source 14′′ (5.800 AU) North-East from MMS 7
(core #1).

MMS 8-9: The prominent ﬁlamentary structure detected by
Mezger et al. (1990) and Chini et al. (1997) breaks into three
local maxima, north- and centre-most of which correspond to
MMS 8 and MMS 9, respectively.

MMS10: The appearance is similar to that evidenced by the
Chini et al. (1997) data, with one local maximum in an elongated
clump.

FIR 1a, b, c: The ALMA data resolves FIR 1a into four
dense cores (three of them have previously been detected from
arcsecond-resolution continuum emission data by Tobin et al.
2015). One of the peaks (core #11) is close (3.′′5, or ∼1 500 AU)
to a Class 0 protostar that has exceptionally high envelope den-
sity and mass-infall rate, discovered by Stutz et al. (2013) (re-
ferred to as the PACS Bright Red Sources, PBRSs). The con-
ﬁguration of the two strongest peaks (cores #11 and 12) bears
resemblance to the Bok Globule CB 244 in which a starless
core and a young protostar co-exist within a common envelope
(Stutz et al. 2010). FIR 1b is relatively extended in the ALMA
map and does not harbour a dense core. FIR 1c contains a single
compact source.

FIR 2: Two cores are found close to the peak identiﬁed by

Chini et al. (1997).

FIR 3-5: Chini et al. (1997) identiﬁes three sources in the re-
gion from mm-wavelength data. Mid-infrared imaging at ∼4′′
resolution resolves eight sources in the region (Adams et al.
2012) and mm-wavelength data detect 12 fragments altogether
(Shimajiri et al. 2008). The ALMA data shows how the region is
inter-connected by a ﬁlamentary structure from which we iden-
tify 13 dense cores. Four cores coincide with HOPS protostars.
The cores #20 and 25 coincide with the FIR 3 and 4 (see, e.g.,
Furlan et al. 2014). FIR 5 does not appear as a dense core in the
ALMA data, although, it is within ∼4′′of the cores #28 and 29.
Previously, Shimajiri et al. (2008) suggested that the fragmenta-
tion in the area is caused by interaction with the outﬂow driven
by FIR 3 with a nearby clump. In general, we ﬁnd a rather poor
correspondence between the ALMA-detected dense cores and
the fragments identiﬁed by Shimajiri et al. (2008). The ALMA
data indicate that the cores are primarily arranged along a ﬁla-
ment in this region.

FIR 6a-e: Another prominent ﬁlamentary structure in the
ALMA data. The sources FIR 6a-d identiﬁed by Chini et al.
(1997) are each resolved into at least two dense cores. The
source FIR 6e is ﬁlamentary in the ALMA data and does not
contain a compact source. Altogether, the region contains nine
dense cores. The south-most tip of the structure harbours four
sources within a ∼12.000 AU region, making it the second dens-
est concentration of sources in the mapped area after the FIR 3-5
ﬁlament.

Our ALMA map continues about 2′ south from the area
mapped by Chini et al. (1997). This area contains two promi-
nent structures elongated in north-south direction. The western
of these is clearly visible in the Herschel-derived column density
map (Stutz & Kainulainen 2015, see Fig. 1). The eastern struc-
ture is not visible in the Herschel data, but is partly visible in
the 850 µm map of Johnstone & Bally (1999). The area contains
four dense cores, listed in Table 2.

erential fragmentation scales, and to subsequently compare the
characteristics to those of the young stellar population of the ﬁla-
ment. First, we compute the basic statistics of the projected near-
est neighbour separations of the objects in the ALMA-covered
region. Note that the sample of 40 dense cores consists of 18
starless cores and 22 protostellar cores. However, there are al-
together 32 protostars in the mapped area; not all protostars co-
incide with an object identiﬁed as a core. We report the mean
and median nearest neighbour separation, dnn, for all diﬀerent
object classes in Table 3. The mean projected nearest neighbour
separations of the dense cores are similar to those seen in the
OMC-3 region of the ISF by Takahashi et al. (2013). They are a
factor of two larger than those measured in the ONC-1n region
by Teixeira et al. (2015). The mean nearest neighbour separa-
tions of protostars and stars with disks are roughly a factor of
two smaller than in Orion A on average (Megeath et al. 2016).
However, we show below and in Sect. 3.3 that the cores, proto-
stars, and disks are clearly grouped in diﬀerent ways. This im-
plies that the mean nearest neighbour separations may not be
very useful measures, especially when averaged over a variety
of environments.

Figure 4 shows the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs)
of the nearest neighbour separations of all cores, starless cores,
protostars, and stars with disks. The CDFs show that the near-
est neighbour distribution of starless cores and protostellar cores
are diﬀerent, with the starless cores exhibiting a larger fraction
of short separations. The short core separations increase down
to the resolution limit of the ALMA data (1 200 AU). Thus, we
do not detect a preferential nearest-neighbour separation for the
dense cores. The CDFs also show that the distribution of the
dense cores is diﬀerent from that of protostars and disks, speciﬁ-
cally so that cores have an excess of short separations compared
to disks and protostars.

3.3. Two-pointcorrelationfunctionofthedensecore,

protostar,anddiskseparations

To analyse the grouping of the cores, we examine the two-point
correlation function, ξ(r), of the core separations. The func-
tion describes the excess probability per unit area, in compari-
son to the expectation from random placement, of an object be-
ing located at a separation r from another object. We adopt the
Landy & Szalay (1993) estimator for the two-point correlation
function

ξ(r) =

DD − 2DR + RR

− 1,

where DD is the observed distribution of pair separations, DR
is the distribution of separations of an observed object and a
random object, and RR is the distribution of pair separations of
randomly placed objects. The ξ(r) = 0 indicates a distribution
similar to random distribution; the positive and negative values
indicate excess and deﬁcit of separations, respectively. We cal-

agreement with a signiﬁcant excess of short separations. To bet-
ter quantify the distribution of protostars in the ISF area, we cal-
culated the two-point correlation function for all 43 protostars
in the northern ISF area (see Fig. 1). For this higher number of
objects, the uncertainties are smaller and the function indicates
a signiﬁcant excess of separations shorter than ∼17 000 AU and
a marginal excess at separations shorter than roughly ∼40 000
AU. This is somewhat in contradiction with the earlier result
that the protostellar cores are in agreement with random dis-
tribution. This may result from the small number of protostel-
lar cores in the ALMA-covered region that prohibits detecting
a marginal excess of separations. In summary, the data suggest
that the dense cores and protostars in the northern ISF show a
similar excess of separations between ∼6 000 - 17 000 AU.

The two-point correlation function of the 54 stars with disks
within the ALMA-covered region is consistent with zero at al-
most all separations (there is a marginally signiﬁcant positive
peak at ∼5 000 AU, see Fig. 6). This indicates that the separation
distribution of disks in the region is in agreement with a random
distribution, and therefore, it is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the
distributions of the dense cores and protostars in the northern
ISF.

4. Discussion

Here, we ﬁrst discuss the fragmentation picture implied by
the observed separation statistics of the diﬀerent object classes
(Sect. 4.1). Then, we discuss the picture in the context of theo-
retical gravitational fragmentation models (Sect. 4.2).

4.1. Thefragmentationpictureimpliedbythespatial

distributionofthecores,protostars,anddisks

Most crucially, we detect increasing grouping of dense cores
at separations below ∼17 000 AU, and especially below ∼6 000
AU. We also show that the frequency of short nearest neighbour
separations of the cores increases down to our resolution limit
(1 200 AU); in other words, we do not detect any peaks in the
nearest neighbour separation indicating well-deﬁned preferen-
tial separations. These observations directly point towards hier-
archical, scale-dependent fragmentation of the ISF. The continu-
ous increase of short separations is especially interesting for the
models of multiplicity during star formation; numerical simula-
tions predict that one eﬃcient formation mechanism of bound
multiple systems is core fragmentation at scales between 500-
5 000 AU (e.g., Oﬀner et al. 2010). Especially, pairs formed at
separations below roughly 3 000-4 000 AU are likely to result in
a gravitationally bound multiple system. The strong increase of
short core separations we detect below ∼6 000 AU may mark the
regime of these systems (see, e.g., Pineda et al. 2015, for a dis-
covery of a bound core system at these scales). Future studies of
the core dynamics within this regime can address this hypothe-
sis. Importantly, the strong grouping of cores below 6 000 AU is
driven by the starless cores, while the protostellar cores do not
show such a grouping signature (cf., Fig. 5). While we cannot
address the origin of this signature using our data, one possibil-
ity is an evolutionary sequence in which the protostellar cores
have lost some of their grouping inherited from the fragmenta-
tion process; this signature is still imprinted in the grouping of
starless cores.

Previously, Teixeira et al. (2015) have studied a section of
the ISF in OMC-1n and claimed evidence of two preferred
nearest-neighbour core separation scales, at 5 500 AU and
13 000 AU. Our data does not indicate peaks in the preferred

est neighbour separations for all dense cores (solid black line),

limit of the ALMA data.

culate the separation distributions using a Gaussian density esti-
mator that has a FWHM = 5′′ (2 100 AU). We tested whether
the choice of the FWHM aﬀects the main conclusions we derive
using two-point correlation functions signiﬁcantly, and it does
not. We compute the random separation distributions (RR) with
a Monte Carlo simulation, in which we place Nobjects random
points in the observed area and compute the separation distribu-
tion; this is repeated 10 000 times to obtain adequate statistics.
The resulting distribution is then re-normalised to correspond
the observed number of cores. The cross term (DR) is com-
puted via a similar simulation, in which the separations between
an observed object and randomly placed objects are calculated.
We compute an uncertainty estimate of the two-point correla-
tion function using bootstrapping. We randomly draw samples of
Nobjects from the observed object locations (replacing the drawn
location before the next draw) and repeat the draw 10 000 times.
We use three times its 25% and 75% quartiles of the resulting
separation distribution as uncertainty estimates (shown in Figs.
5 and 6).

The two-point correlation functions of the 18 starless cores,
22 protostellar cores, and all 40 cores together are shown in
Fig. 5. All are close to zero above 17 000 AU, indicating no
strong grouping at larger separations (however, see Sect. 4). The
two-point correlation function of the starless cores is dramati-
cally diﬀerent from that of the protostellar cores. The starless
cores show a systematic increase of grouping at short separations
down to our resolution limit. The protostellar cores are in agree-
ment with a random distribution practically at all separations.
However, one has to recognise that the number of detections es-
pecially below ∼10 000 AU is very small, and consequently, the
uncertainty is large. The two-point correlation function of all 40
cores together is sampled reasonably well down to our resolu-
tion limit, and it shows signiﬁcant grouping below 17 000 AU
and strong grouping below ∼6 000 AU.

We then analyse the two-point correlation function of the
protostars (Fig. 6). For the 34 protostars in the ALMA-covered
area, the function is in agreement with a random distribution.
However, there are very few short (.10 000 AU) separations,
hampering the accuracy of the function; the function is also in

Our two-point correlation analysis has so far concentrated
on detecting grouping at small scales (short separations); with
the relatively low number of objects we detect, this results in a
high uncertainty of the function (cf., Figs. 5 and 6). We looked
for weaker (but signiﬁcant) signals in the two-point correlation
function of the dense cores by heavily smoothing it to gain a bet-
ter signal-to-noise. The two-point correlation function derived
with a smoothing function that has FWHM=20′′=8 400 AU is
shown in Fig. 7. The function shows a signiﬁcant negative fea-
ture between ∼20 000-40 000 AU, indicating a deﬁcit of cores
at these separations with respect to a random distribution (note
that by deﬁnition, the two-point correlation function cannot have
values lower than -1, see Eq. 2). This feature is followed by a
marginally signiﬁcant peak at ∼55 000 AU.

The above signatures have an intuitive interpretation in cylin-
dric geometry. Consider groups of cores along a line that have
the size D and that are separated by λ (with D < λ). Then, a
minimum is expected in the two-point correlation function at D,
and it is followed by a maximum at λ. We further illustrate the
signiﬁcance of such signature with a simple simulation. The sim-
ulation setup was guided by the surface number density of the
ALMA-detected cores (Fig. 7). We construct a simplistic model
in which groups of cores are located along a line with a constant
separation. The simulation area matches the dimensions of the
ALMA ﬁeld, and we place six groups in the ﬁeld. The groups

core separations, but rather a continuous increase of short sepa-
rations. This diﬀerence may be due to various reasons. For ex-
ample, Teixeira et al. (2015) only had a sample of 24 cores, ham-
pering the operation of statistical estimators; they do not present
an analysis of how signiﬁcant their detections of the preferred
scales are. Also, our core identiﬁcation method is diﬀerent from
that of Teixeira et al. (2015), making a direct comparison diﬃ-
cult. Studies targeting other massive ﬁlaments have commonly
quantiﬁed mean separations between structures detected at dif-
ferent spatial scales (e.g., Jackson et al. 2010; Miettinen 2012;
Kainulainen et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014; Beuther et al. 2015a;
Contreras et al. 2016). However, none of these works to our
knowledge has analysed the higher-order statistics of the frag-
ment separations and linked them to the young stellar distribu-
tion in the clouds.

J. Kainulainen et al.: Fragmentation of high line-mass ﬁlaments as revealed by ALMA: the integral shaped ﬁlament in Orion A

have the size of 42 000 AU and their separation is 56 000 AU.
The placement of cores within the groups is random. The bottom
right panel of Fig. 7 shows a typical two-point correlation func-
tion resulting for 40 simulated cores. The simulation illustrates
that the basic signatures of this conﬁguration, i.e., the deﬁcit of
cores at D (42 000 AU) and the excess at λ (56 000 AU), are
generally expected to be detectable with a sample of 40 cores.

Given the above, we conclude that the two-point correla-
tion function of the ALMA-detected cores indicates periodic
grouping into groups roughly 30 000 AU in size, separated by
roughly 55 000 AU. The separation corresponds exactly to the
size-scale of the dust structures seen periodically along the ﬁla-
ment crest in the Herschel-derived column density map (see Fig.
1; Stutz & Kainulainen 2015). At scales signiﬁcantly smaller
than 30 000 AU, i.e., inside the individual groups, the ALMA
cores group preferentially to separations below 6 000 AU (cf.,
Fig. 5).

The above picture is in agreement with previous studies that
have found signatures interpreted as co-existing spherical and
cylindric gravitational fragmentation modes in high line-mass
ﬁlaments, with the transition between the two occurring at a
few tenths of a parsec (0.3 pc = 60 000 AU; Kainulainen et al.
2013; Takahashi et al. 2013). Such a transition could result, for
example, from the ﬁnite-size eﬀects in ﬁlaments: below a cer-
tain size-scale local collapse may proceed faster than the global
collapse of the ﬁlament (e.g., Pon et al. 2011; Kainulainen et al.
2013). Regardless of its driver, our data suggests that a similar
signature is detectable in the separation distribution of the cores:
the 55 000 AU separations between the groups correspond to the
scale of the ﬁlamentary fragmentation mode, and the increasing
separations below ∼17 000 AU correspond to the scale of the
spherical fragmentation mode. We further address the feasibility
of this interpretation in Sect. 4.2.

The relationship between the separation distributions of the
dense cores, protostars, and disks can indicate temporal evolu-
tion. The dense core and protostar separation distributions show
similarity between ∼6 000 - 17 000 AU. This suggests that the
initial grouping of the dense cores is not totally erased over
the core life-time, nor the protostar life-time (∼0.5 Myr; e.g.,
Dunham et al. 2014). However, the diﬀerent grouping of stars
with disks shows that it is erased over the life-time of stars with
disks (∼2 Myr; e.g., Evans et al. 2009; Dunham et al. 2014).
This provides support for the dynamical slingshot model of
Stutz & Gould (2015), in which the gravitational potential well
of the surrounding gas reservoir in the ISF holds the protostars
close to their maternal ﬁlament section. However, the (proto-
)stars decouple from the gas reservoir due to the slingshot, at
which point they can loose their initial grouping properties. We
note a general caveat that our data probe a narrow ﬁeld centred
on the densest part of the ﬁlament. The disk population extends
to a signiﬁcantly larger volume than this ﬁeld, occupying also a
larger volume than dense cores and protostars do. We are insen-
sitive to the grouping signatures the disk population may show
outside this ﬁeld.

4.2. Comparisonagainstgravitationalfragmentationmodels

We now discuss the observational fragmentation picture in the
context of the gravitational fragmentation models that have been
developed for near-equilibrium spheres and cylinders in the
regime of linear evolution, i.e., small perturbations (e.g., Jeans
1902; Ostriker 1964; Fiege & Pudritz 2000a; Fischera & Martin
2012). Importantly, these models show that both in the spher-
ical and cylindric cases there is a well-deﬁned range of unsta-

ble wavelengths that lead to growing perturbations. Furthermore,
they show that within this range the growth rate has a well-
deﬁned maximum that deﬁnes the fastest-growing perturbation
wavelength. This results in the fundamental prediction of these

nation for the periodic grouping of the cores. Several other
works have also found fragmentation in massive ﬁlaments at
these scales (e.g., Busquet et al. 2013; Kainulainen et al. 2013;
Takahashi et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014; Beuther et al. 2015b;
Teixeira et al. 2015). One should note that, e.g., the presence
of magnetic ﬁelds can signiﬁcantly alter the prediction for the
fragmentation scale (e.g., Fiege & Pudritz 2000b). We also have
assumed an inclination angle of zero throughout this paper.

c

In summary,

the observational picture of fragmentation
within ISF is not in agreement with any single existing frag-
mentation model alone. Instead, a multi-scale model is needed.
We can speculate about the framework for such a model based
on the fragmentation time-scales predicted by the existing frag-
mentation models. A high-aspect ratio ﬁlament ﬁrst fragments
following the prediction of the cylindric gravitational fragmen-
tation model (in the ISF, this would correspond to the fragmen-
tation seen at 55 000 AU scale). The characteristic time-scale
for this is τm ≈ 3 × p1/(4πρcG) ≈ 0.2 Myr. By deﬁnition,
the fragments have a higher mean density than the initial ﬁla-
ment (assuming no mass is lost to stars at this point). This leads
to a shorter fragmentation time-scale within the fragment com-
pared to the initial fragmentation time, by a factor of ρ−1/2
(e.g.,
Fiege & Pudritz 2000a; Fischera & Martin 2012). If the global
collapse time-scale of the fragments is their free-fall time (about
0.1 Myr at the density of 105 cm−3), this leads to a competition
between the global collapse of the fragment and further fragmen-
tation inside it (e.g., Pon et al. 2011, 2012; Clarke & Whitworth
2015). Clearly, the latter must ensue faster, because we observe
fragmentation down to ∼1 000 AU scales. However, it is not ob-
vious how to arrive to this conclusion, because both the free-
fall time and the fragmentation time depend on density with the
same power (∝ ρ−0.5). One possible route is provided by mag-
netic ﬁelds that may provide support against a global collapse
while not strongly aﬀecting the fragmentation time-scale (e.g.,
Fiege & Pudritz 2000a,b, see also Seifried & Walch 2015 for a
numerical study showing an analogous eﬀect in ﬁlaments that
are thermally near-critical). Another possibility could be large-
enough, pre-existing density ﬂuctuations that can grow and col-
lapse faster than the global collapse ensues (Pon et al. 2011).
Developing this cartoon framework into a coherent theory is be-
yond this paper, but it would be a crucial topic for future works
that aim at understand the fragmentation of high line-mass ﬁla-
ments.

models: a preferential fragmentation scale at the fastest-growing
perturbation wavelength.

Here, we immediately notice a grounding problem in com-
paring our observations with these models. The fragmentation
of the ISF is not in agreement with one, well-deﬁned frag-
mentation scale. First of all, we do not detect a single pref-
erential fragmentation scale, but a more complicated picture:
an increase of short separations below 17 000 AU, especially
below 6 000 AU, and periodic grouping at 55 000 AU. Scale-
dependent, hierarchical fragmentation has also been detected
in other high line-mass ﬁlaments (e.g., Kainulainen et al. 2013;
Takahashi et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014; Beuther et al. 2015b;
Teixeira et al. 2015). These observations question the applica-
bility of the existing models (as such) to address the fragmenta-
tion of high-line mass ﬁlaments. Further, they call for theoretical
works aiming at explaining multi-scale, hierarchical fragmenta-
tion.

In the absence of a comprehensive multi-scale theory (and
acknowledging the caveat that the current theories may not be
applicable), we calculate the predictions of the spherical and
cylindric gravitational fragmentation models for the fragmenta-
tion scale of the ISF. Spherical gravitational fragmentation pre-
dicts preferential fragmentation at the Jeans’ length-scale, lJ =
cs(G/ρ)1/2, where cs is the isothermal sound speed. To evaluate
this, we adopt the temperature of 20 K as before. Stutz & Gould
(2015) have evaluated the (cylindric) density proﬁle of the ISF to
be 17 M⊙ pc−3(r/pc)−13/8 down to their resolution limit of 0.04
pc. If we use the density at 0.04 pc as the proxy of the density
relevant for Jeans’ fragmentation, the density of ∼ 105 cm−3 and
the fragmentation scale of ∼10.000 AU follows. We also make
another estimate of the relevant density by estimating the mean
densities of the six main structures in the Herschel-derived col-
umn density map of the area (see Fig. 7). We do this by summing
up all column densities in the area of the structures and assum-
ing the structures are spherical. This resulted in the mean density
of 2 × 105 cm−3, and from therein, in the fragmentation scale of
∼7 000 AU. These fragmentation scales are in the range of the
separations the cores show signiﬁcantly increased short separa-
tions, i.e., .17 000 AU. The scales are smaller by factors of six
and eight compared to the 55 000 AU separation between the
core groups identiﬁed from the ALMA data (or the separation
between the dust structures identiﬁed from the Herschel data,
cf., Fig. 7). Thus, from this point-of-view, the fragmentation at
∼10 000 AU scales is in a rough agreement with the prediction
of Jeans’ fragmentation, while the fragmentation at larger scales
seems less likely to be.

How can the 55 000 AU, periodic fragmentation scale along
the ﬁlament then be reconciled? In the gravitational fragmen-
tation of a near-equilibrium ﬁlament (i.e., cylinder), the wave-
length of the fastest growing unstable mode depends on the
FWHM of the ﬁlament, or equivalently, on the central density,
scale-radius, or line-mass (these are all inter-connected in the
equilibrium solution). The fragmentation scale is then ∼3 times
the FWHM of the ﬁlament (Fischera & Martin 2012, see also
Fiege & Pudritz 2000a). We do not know well the FWHM of
the ISF, but we can use the dependency of the FWHM on cen-
tral density to obtain an estimate. For a near-equilibrium ﬁla-
ment, FWHM ≈ 4 × cs(4πGρc)−0.5 (Fischera & Martin 2012). If
we again use the density at r = 0.04 pc as the relevant density,
the FWHM≈0.06 pc follows, yielding the fragmentation scale
of ∼40 000 AU. This is within a factor of 1.5 of the periodic sep-
aration between the ALMA-detected core groups, or between
the Herschel-detected dust structures (∼55 000 AU). Therefore,
ﬁlamentary gravitational fragmentation may provide an expla-

5. Conclusions

We present a fragmentation study of a 1.6 pc long section of the
ISF in the Orion A molecular cloud, speciﬁcally covering the
OMC-2 and a part of the OMC-3 region. We employ ALMA 3
mm continuum emission data that reach the spatial resolution of
∼3”, or 1 200 AU. We also study the relationship between the
distributions of the dense cores, protostars, and stars with disks
using the census of the young stellar population build by the
Spitzer Orion Survey and HOPS. Our conclusions are as follows.

1. The ALMA data reveal numerous substructures from the
ISF, including compact and extended structures and ﬁla-
ments. Most of the single-peaked structures detected pre-
viously in coarser resolution resolve into substructures.
Especially, we detect a prominent ﬁlament in the FIR 3-5
region connecting a series of dense cores and protostars.

2. We identify 40 dense cores from the ALMA data, 22 (55%)
of which coincide with protostars and 18 of which are
starless. The nearest neighbour separation distribution of

11

the cores increases down to our resolution limit, indicat-
ing that there is no preferential nearest-neighbour separa-
tion. The nearest-neighbour separation distributions of the
starless cores and protostellar cores are diﬀerent; the starless
cores show a higher fraction of short nearest-neighbour sep-
arations than the protostellar cores.

3. The two-point correlation analysis of the dense core separa-
tions shows that the cores are signiﬁcantly grouped at sep-
arations smaller than ∼17 000 AU and strongly grouped at
separations smaller than ∼6 000 AU. This signature is dif-
ferent for starless and protostellar cores: the starless cores
show strong grouping, while the protostellar cores show
only marginally signiﬁcant grouping. The strong increase
of grouping below 6 000 AU may be related to the regime
where interactions between the cores become abundant. The
two-point correlation function also indicates a quasi-periodic
grouping of the cores into groups ∼30 000 AU in size, sep-
arated by ∼55 000 AU. These groups corresponds to the gas
morphology traced by the Herschel column density map of
the region (Stutz & Kainulainen 2015).

4. The two-point correlation analysis shows that the protostars
in the entire northern ISF are signiﬁcantly grouped at sepa-
rations shorter than ∼17 000 AU. Thus, they show partially
similar grouping as the dense cores; however, the protostars
do not show strong grouping below ∼6 000 AU like the dense
cores do. The distribution of stars with disks is in agreement
with random distribution within the ALMA-covered region,
and it is thus signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that of the dense
cores and protostars. These results suggest that the group-
ing of dense cores, resulting from the fragmentation process,
is not totally erased during the protostar life-time, but it is
erased during the longer life-times of stars with disks. This
is in agreement with the picture of (Stutz & Gould 2015) in
which the protostars are ejected from the ﬁlament by the
slingshot mechanism.

5. The fragmentation signatures we extract from the spatial dis-
tribution of the cores are in agreement with a previously
detected scale-dependency of fragmentation in massive ﬁl-
aments (e.g., Kainulainen et al. 2013; Takahashi et al. 2013;
Wang et al. 2014). We use the density proﬁle along the ﬁl-
ament derived by Stutz & Gould (2015) and show that the
predictions for the Jeans’ fragmentation scale is ∼10 000 AU
and for the ﬁlamentary gravitational fragmentation scale is
∼40 000 AU. These scales are similar to the scales at which
the cores show grouping, however we note that neither of the
models, nor the two models together, can fully characterise
the entire hierarchy of the fragmentation in the ISF.

Our results provide the most sensitive view of the 1 000
AU scale fragmentation within a massive ﬁlament to date.
Especially, our detection of increasingly abundant separations
below 6 000 AU opens the question of the abundance of bound
groups at these separations. Further observations targeting the
dynamics of the cores and scales between 500-1 000 AU will
be able to quantify this and address the question of stellar mul-
tiplicity resulting from core fragmentation. Similarly, our work
highlights the need for theoretical work addressing the multi-
scale nature of fragmentation; our observations provide concrete
constraints for testing such models.

Appendix A: Effect of the background ﬁlter width

on the core identiﬁcation

We tested the eﬀect of the background ﬁlter width used in
the dense core identiﬁcation on the resulting two-point corre-
lation functions. We repeated the core identiﬁcation with the ﬁl-
ter widths between 7.5′′-15′′. The resulting two-point correla-
tion functions are shown in Fig. A.1. The functions are drawn
only above the minimum separation of the dense cores. The test
shows that the choice of the background ﬁlter does not aﬀect the
main conclusions derived from the two-point correlation func-
tions. This comes from the fact that the majority of the cores are
identiﬁed similarly regardless of the choice of the background
ﬁlter width. When a small ﬁlter is chosen, only the strongest
(most signiﬁcant) cores are detected. When the ﬁlter width ap-
proaches 15′′, structures identiﬁed as separate dense cores are
occasionally identiﬁed as one, larger core. The test shows that
optimum ﬁlter width for detecting cores in 3′′ resolution is be-
tween ∼7.5′′-12.5′′. Our ﬁnal choice, 10′′, is within this range.
