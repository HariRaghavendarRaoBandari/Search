Abstract As well-known, transition probabilities of jump Markov processes satisfy Kol-
mogorov’s backward and forward equations. In the seminal 1940 paper, William Feller in-
vestigated solutions of Kolmogorov’s equations for jump Markov processes. Recently the
authors solved the problem studied by Feller and showed that the minimal solution of Kol-
mogorov’s backward and forward equations is the transition probability of the correspond-
ing jump Markov process if the transition rate at each state is bounded. This paper presents
more general results. For Kolmogorov’s backward equation, the sufﬁcient condition for the
described property of the minimal solution is that the transition rate at each state is locally
integrable, and for Kolmogorov’s forward equation the corresponding sufﬁcient condition is
that the transition rate at each state is locally bounded.

1 Introduction

Continuous-time jump Markov processes are broadly used in stochastic models of opera-
tions research. In many applications continuous-time jump Markov processes are deﬁned by
transition rates often called Q-functions. Each Q-function deﬁnes Kolmogorov’s backward
and forward equations, and transition probabilities of jump Markov processes deﬁned by Q-
functions satisfy these equations. If transition rates are unbounded, Kolmogorov’s equations
may have multiple solutions, see, e.g., Anderson [1, Chap. 4, Example 1.2], Doob [4, Chap.

6], Kendall [12], Reuter [15], and the relation between Kolmogorov’s equations and the cor-
responding transition probabilities is not trivial. For example, in queueing theory birth and
death processes have unbounded transition rates in each of the following three situations:
arrival rates depend on the state of the system and are unbounded, queues with an inﬁnite
number of servers, queues with reneging.

This paper answers the questions on how a nonhomogeneous jump Markov process can
be deﬁned for a given Q-function and how can its transition probability be found as a so-
lution of Kolmogorov’s backward and forward equations. These questions were studied by
Feller [7] for continuous Q-functions and a standard Borel state space, by Ye et al. [17] for
measurable Q-functions and a countable state space, and by Feinberg et al. [6] for measur-
able Q-functions and a standard Borel state space. All these papers considered Q-functions
satisfying certain boundedness conditions. This paper generalizes the results from Feinberg
et al. [6] to more general classes of unbounded Q-functions, strengthens some of results
from [6], and provides proofs of the following two facts: (i) (Lemma 1(a)) Fellers’s assump-
tion on the boundedness of a Q-function, Assumption 1, is equivalent to the boundedness of
a Q-function at each state, Assumption 2, and (ii) (Theorem 4) Kolmogorov’s forward equa-
tion is equivalent to the integral equation (14). The ﬁrst fact is introduced and the validity of
equation (14) is stated in [6] without detailed proofs.

For a topological space S, its Borel s -ﬁeld (the s -ﬁeld generated by open subsets of
S) is always denoted by B(S), and the sets in B(S) are called Borel subsets of S. Let R
be the real line endowed with the Euclidean metric. A topological space (S, B(S)) is called
a standard Borel space if there exists a bijection f from (S, B(S)) to a Borel subset of R
such that the mappings f and f −1 are measurable. In this paper, measurability and Borel
measurability are used synonymously. Let (X, B(X)) be a standard Borel space, called the
state space, and let [T0, T1[ be a ﬁnite or an inﬁnite interval in R+ := [0,¥
[. In this paper, we
always assume that T0 < T1. A function P(u, x;t, B), where u ∈ [T0, T1[, t ∈]u, T1[, x ∈ X, and
B ∈ B(X), is called a transition function if it takes values in [0, 1] and satisﬁes the following
properties:

(i) for all u, x,t the function P(u, x;t, ·) is a measure on (X, B(X));
(ii) for all B the function P(u, x;t, B) is Borel measurable in (u, x,t);
(iii) P(u, x;t, B) satisﬁes the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation

P(u, x;t, B) =ZX

P(s, y;t, B)P(u, x; s, dy),

u < s < t.

(1)

A transition function P is called regular if P(u, x;t, X) = 1 for all u, x,t in the domain of P.
A stochastic process {Xt : t ∈ [T0, T1[} with values in X, deﬁned on the probability space
(W
, F , P) and adapted to the ﬁltration {Ft}t∈[T0,T1[, is called Markov if P(Xt ∈ B | Fu) =
P(Xt ∈ B | Xu), P − a.s. for all u ∈ [T0, T1[, t ∈]u, T1[, and B ∈ B(X). Each Markov pro-
cess has a transition function P such that P(Xt ∈ B | Xu) = P(u, Xu;t, B), P − a.s.; see
Kuznetsov [14], where the equivalence of two deﬁnitions of a Markov process given by
Kolmogorov [13] is established. In addition, if a Markov process is a jump process, that
is, if each sample path of the process is a right-continuous piecewise constant function in t
that has a ﬁnite or countable number of discontinuity points on t ∈ [T0, T1[, then the Markov
process is called a jump Markov process.

A function q(x,t, B), where x ∈ X, t ∈ [T0, T1[, and B ∈ B(X), is called a Q-function if it

satisﬁes the following properties:

(a) for all x,t the function q(x,t, ·) is a signed measure on (X, B(X)) such that q(x,t, X) ≤

0 and 0 ≤ q(x,t, B \ {x}) < ¥

for all B ∈ B(X);

Kolmogorov’s equations for jump Markov processes

(b) for all B the function q(x,t, B) is measurable in (x,t).
In addition to properties (a) and (b), if q(x,t, X) = 0 for all x,t, then the Q-function q is
called conservative. Note that any Q-function can be transformed into a conservative Q-
function by adding an absorbing state ¯x to X with q(x,t, { ¯x}) := −q(x,t, X), q( ¯x,t, X) :=
0, and q( ¯x,t, { ¯x}) := 0, where x ∈ X and t ∈ [T0, T1[. To simplify the presentation, in this
paper we always assume that q is conservative. The same arguments as in Remark 4.1 in
Feinberg et al. [6] explain how the main formulations change when the Q-function q is not
conservative. A Q-function q is called continuous if it is continuous in t ∈ [T0, T1[.

Feller [7] studied Kolmogorov’s backward and forward equations for continuous Q-
functions and provided explicit formulae for a transition function that satisﬁes Kolmogorov’s
backward and forward equations. If the constructed transition function is regular, Feller [7,
Theorem 3] showed that this transition function is the unique solution of Kolmogorov’s
backward equation. Though Feller [7] focused on regular transition functions, it follows
from the proof of Theorem 3 in Feller [7] that the transition function constructed there
is the minimal solution of Kolmogorov’s backward equation. Feinberg et al. [6] showed
for a measurable Q-function that the transition function constructed by Feller [7] is the
minimal solution of Kolmogorov’s backward and forward equations, and it is the transition
function of the jump Markov process deﬁned by the random measure whose compensator is
deﬁned via the Q-function. In this paper, we show that the minimal solution of Kolmogorov’s
backward and forward equations is the transition probability of the corresponding jump
Markov process under more general boundedness assumptions on Q-functions than those
assumed in [6].

2 Assumptions and description of main results

In this section, we describe several assumptions on unbounded Q-functions and the re-
sults of this paper. Let q(x,t) := −q(x,t, {x}) for x ∈ X and t ∈ [T0, T1[, and let ¯q(x) :=
supt∈[T0,T1[ q(x,t) for x ∈ X. Feller [7] studied Kolmogorov’s equations for continuous Q-
functions under the following assumption.

Assumption 1 (Feller’s assumption) There exists Borel subsets Bn, n = 1, 2, . . . , of X such
that supx∈Bn ¯q(x) < n for all n = 1, 2, . . . and Bn ↑ X as n → ¥

.

Feinberg et al. [6] studied Kolmogorov’s equations for measurable Q-functions under

the following assumption with T0 = 0 and T1 = ¥
Assumption 2 (Boundedness of q) ¯q(x) < ¥

.

for each x ∈ X.

As mentioned in Feinberg et al. [6, p. 262], Assumptions 1 and 2 are equivalent; see

Lemma 1(a) for details. In this section, we introduce two more general assumptions.
Assumption 3 (Local boundedness of q) supt∈[T0,s[ q(x,t) < ¥
q(x, s)ds < ¥
Assumption 4 (Local L 1 boundedness of q)R t

The following lemma compares Assumptions 1–4.

for each s ∈]T0, T1[ and x ∈ X.

for each t ∈]T0, T1[ and x ∈ X.

Lemma 1 The following statements hold for a measurable Q-function q :

(a) Assumptions 1 and 2 are equivalent;
(b) Assumption 2 implies Assumption 3;
(c) Assumption 3 implies Assumption 4.

Feinberg et al.

Proof (a) Let {Bn, n = 1, 2, . . .} be a sequence of Borel subsets of X satisfying the prop-
erties stated in Assumption 1. Then for each x ∈ X there exists an n ∈ {1, 2, . . .} such that
x ∈ Bn and therefore ¯q(x) < n. Thus, Assumption 1 implies Assumption 2. To prove that
Assumption 2 implies Assumption 1, deﬁne Cn := {x ∈ X : ¯q(x) ≥ n}, n = 1, 2, . . . . Since
Cn = pro jX({(x,t) ∈ (X × [T0, T1[) : q(x,t) ≥ n}) are projections of Borel sets, the sets Cn
are analytic for all n = 1, 2, . . .; see Bertsekas and Shreve [2, Proposition 7.39]. In addition,
n=1 Cn = /0. Thus, in view of the Novikov separation theorem,
Kechris [11, Theorem 28.5], there exist Borel subsets Zn, n = 1, 2, . . . , of X such that Cn ⊆ Zn
n and Cc

m for all n = 1, 2, . . . .

⊓⊔

Remark 1 Under Assumption 1, which, as stated in Lemma 1(a), is equivalent to Assump-
tion 2, Feller [7] studied Kolmogorov’s equations for the time parameter t ∈ [T0, T1[. Under
Assumption 2, Feinberg et al. [6] studied Kolmogorov’s equations for the time parameter
t ∈ [T0, T1[= [0,¥
[. It is apparent that the formulation of results for an arbitrary interval
[T0, T1[, where 0 ≤ T0 < T1 ≤ ¥
, is more general than their formulation for the interval
[0,¥
[. In fact, these two formulations are equivalent under Assumption 2 holding for the
corresponding time intervals. Indeed, a Q-function q, deﬁned for t ∈ [T0, T1[ and satisfying
Assumption 2 on this interval, can be extended to all t ∈ [0,¥
[ by setting q(x,t, B) := 0 for
x ∈ X, t ∈ [0, T0[∪[T1,¥
[, and B ∈ B(X). The extended Q-function satisﬁes Assumption 2
for t ∈ [0,¥
[. Since solutions of Kolmogorov’s equations (11) and (13) for the extended
Q-function are constants in t, when t ∈ [0, T0[ and t ∈ [T1,¥
[, and since Kolmogorov’s equa-
tions for the original Q-function q and the extended Q-function coincide when t ∈ [T0, T1[,
there is a one-to-one correspondence between solutions of Kolmogorov’s equations for the
Q-function q and for the extended Q-function. Since Assumption 2 is assumed in [6], the re-
sults obtained in [6] for the problem formulations for the interval [0,¥
[ hold for an arbitrary
interval [T0, T1[.

As explained in Remark 1, if a Q-function q satisﬁes Assumption 2 on the interval
[T0, T1[, its extension to t ∈ [0,¥
[.
The following example illustrates that this need not be the case if q satisﬁes Assumption 3
or Assumption 4. Hence, following Feller [7], we formulate the results in this paper for an
arbitrary interval [T0, T1[ with 0 ≤ T0 < T1 < ¥

[ deﬁned in Remark 1 satisﬁes the same assumption on [0,¥

.

Example 1 A Q-function q satisﬁes Assumption 3 on the interval [T0, T1[, while its extention
to t ∈ [0,¥
[ deﬁned in Remark 1 does not satisfy even the weaker Assumption 4 when T0 = 0
and T1 = ¥
. Fix an arbitrary T1 ∈]0,¥
T1−t for
all x ∈ X, 0 ≤ t < T1. Then supt∈[T0,s[ q(x,t) ≤ (T1 − s)−1 < ¥
for each s ∈]T0, T1[ and x ∈ X.
Thus the Q-function q satisﬁes Assumption 3.

[. Let T0 := 0, X := {1, 2, . . .}, and q(x,t) := 1

Consider the extension of q to t ∈ [0,¥

[ deﬁned in Remark 1 and the sequence {tm, m =

1, 2, . . .} ⊂ [0, T1[ with tm = T1 − 1

Kolmogorov’s equations for jump Markov processes

5

In Section 3 we show in Theorem 1 that under Assumption 4 the compensator deﬁned
by a Q-function and an initial probability measure deﬁne a jump Markov process, whose
transition function ¯P is described in (7), and Theorem 2 states that this function is the min-
imal function satisfying Kolmogorov’s backward equation. The function ¯P was introduced
in Feller [7]. Section 4 deals with Kolmogorov’s forward equation, when Assumption 3
holds, and Theorem 3 states that ¯P is the minimal function satisfying the forward equation.
Section 5 presents results on Kolmogorov’s forward equation under Assumption 2.

3 Jump Markov process deﬁned by a Q-function and Kolmogorov’s backward
equation

In this section, we show that a Q-function satisfying Assumption 4 deﬁnes a transition func-
tion for a jump Markov process. In addition, this transition function is the minimal function
satisfying Kolmogorov’s backward equation deﬁned by this Q-function.

Let x¥ /∈ X be an isolated point adjoined to the space X. Denote ¯X = X ∪ {x¥ }. Consider
the Borel s -ﬁeld B( ¯X) = s (B(X), {x¥ }) on ¯X, which is the minimal s -ﬁeld containing

B(X) and {x¥ }. Let ( ¯X×]T0, T1])
xn ∈ ¯X and tn+1 ∈]T0, T1] for all n = 0, 1, . . . . This set is endowed with the s -ﬁeld generated
by the products of the Borel s -ﬁelds B( ¯X) and B( ¯T ).

then tn+1 = tn and xn = x¥

the measurable space (W

all n = 0, 1, . . ., let xn(w ) = xn and tn+1(w ) = tn+1, where w ∈ W

deﬁned on the measurable space (W

all t ∈ [T0, T1], let Ft := s (B(X), Gt), where Gt := s (I{xn ∈ B}I{tn ≤ s} : n ≥ 1, T0 ≤ s ≤

Observe that n
is a predictable random measure. Indeed, formula (3) coincides with Fein-
berg et al. [6, Eq. (2)] when T0 = 0 and T1 = ¥
. Arguments similar to those following
Feinberg et al. [6, Eq. (2)], which show that the random measure n deﬁned in [6, Eq. (2)]
is a predictable random measure, imply that the measure n deﬁned in (3) is a predictable
random measure. Furthermore, n ({t} × X) ≤ 1 for all t ∈]T0, T1[ and n ([t¥

According to Jacod [10, Theorem 3.6], the predictable random measure n deﬁned in (3)
and a probability measure g on X deﬁne a unique probability measure P on (W

that P(x0 ∈ B) = g (B), B ∈ B(X), and n

For x ∈ X and t ∈ [T0, T1[, let q+(x,t, ·) be the measure on (X, B(X)) with values

q+(x,t, B) := q(x,t, B \ {x}), B ∈ B(X). In this paper, we use the notation

q(x,t, dz \ {x}) := q+(x,t, dz).

Following Feller [7, Theorem 2], for x ∈ X, u ∈ [T0, T1[, t ∈]u, T1[, and B ∈ B(X), deﬁne

Though Feller [7] considered continuous Q-functions, the proof of (8) given in Feller [7,
Theorem 4] remains correct for measurable Q-functions.

Observe that ¯P is a transition function if the Q-function q satisﬁes Assumption 4. For
continuous Q-functions satisfying Assumption 1, Feller [7, Theorems 2, 5] proved that: (a)
for ﬁxed u, x,t the function ¯P(u, x;t, ·) is a measure on (X, B(X)) such that 0 ≤ ¯P(u, x;t, ·) ≤
1, and (b) for all u, x,t, B the function ¯P(u, x;t, B) satisﬁes the Chapman-Kolmogorov equa-
tion (1). The proofs remain correct for measurable Q-functions satisfying Assumption 4.
The measurability of ¯P(u, x;t, B) in u, x,t for all B ∈ B(X) follows directly from the deﬁni-
tions (5), (6), and (7). Therefore, if q satisﬁes Assumption 4, the function ¯P takes values in
[0, 1] and satisﬁes properties (i)-(iii) from the deﬁnition of a transition function.
Theorem 1 (cp. Feinberg et al. [6, Theorem 2.2]) Given a probability measure g on X and
a Q-function q satisfying Assumption 4, the jump process {Xt : t ∈ [T0, T1[} deﬁned in (4) is
a jump Markov process with the transition function ¯P.

Proof The statement of the theorem follows from the same arguments as in the proof of
Feinberg et al. [6, Theorem 2.2], where the case T0 = 0 and T1 = ¥ was considered. We
remark that though it was assumed there that the Q-function q satisﬁes Assumption 2, the
arguments in the proof in [6] only require that,

Let P be the family of all real-valued non-negative functions P(u, x;t, B), deﬁned for
all t ∈]T0, T1[, u ∈ [T0,t[, x ∈ X, and B ∈ B(X), which are measurable in (u, x) ∈ [T0,t[×X
for all t ∈]T0, T1[ and B ∈ B(X). Observe that ¯P ∈ P.

f (x) ≤ g(x) holds for all x ∈ E. The following theorem generalizes Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 in
Feinberg et al. [6], stating the same statements under Assumption 2 which is stronger than
Assumption 4. The measurability in (u, x) of a function satisfying Kolmogorov’s backward
equation is implicitly assumed in Feinberg et al. [6].

Theorem 2 Under Assumption 4, the transition function ¯P is the minimal function in P
satisfying the following two properties:

(i) for all t ∈]T0, T1[, x ∈ X, and B ∈ B(X),

In addition, if the transition function ¯P is regular (that is, ¯P(u, x;t, X) = 1 for all u, x,
t in the domain of ¯P), then ¯P is the unique function in P satisfying properties (i), (ii) and
which is a measure on (X, B(X)) for all t ∈]T0, T1[, u ∈ [T0,t[, and x ∈ X, and taking values
in [0, 1].

Proof Under Assumption 2, this theorem is Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 from Feinberg et al. [6]
combined. However, the proofs there only use the property that (9) holds, and this property
is true under Assumption 4. Therefore, the statement of the theorem holds.

4 Kolmogorov’s forward equation

Under Assumption 2, Kolmogorov’s forward equation (13) was studied by Feller [7, The-
orem 1] for continuous Q-functions and by Feinberg et al. [6, Theorems 4.1, 4.3] for mea-
surable Q-functions. In this section, we study Kolmogorov’s forward equation (13) under
Assumption 3, which, in view of Lemma 1(b), is more general than Assumption 2.

ˆP be the family of real-valued functions ˆP(u, x;t, B), deﬁned for all u ∈ [T0, T1[,
t ∈]u, T1[, x ∈ X, and B ∈ B(X), which are measures on (X, B(X)) for ﬁxed u, x, t and are
measurable functions in t for ﬁxed u, x, B. In particular, ¯P ∈ ˆP, where ¯P is deﬁned in (7).

Let

Deﬁnition 1 For s ∈]T0, T1], a set B ∈ B(X) is called (q, s)-bounded if the function q(x,t)
is bounded on the set B × [T0, s[.

Deﬁnition 2 A (q, T1)-bounded set is called q-bounded.

In Deﬁnition 2 we follow the terminology from Feinberg et al. [6, p. 262]. Feller [7] called
such sets bounded.

The following theorem shows that the transition function ¯P is the minimal function satis-
fying Kolmogorov’s forward equation. Being applied to a function q satisfying the stronger
Assumption 2, this theorem implies Corollary 5, which is a stronger result than [6, Theorem
4.3]; see explanations before Corollary 5.

In addition, if the transition function ¯P is regular, then ¯P is the unique function in ˆP

satisfying properties (i), (ii) and taking values in [0, 1].

As stated in Theorem 3, the function ¯P satisﬁes Kolmogorov’s forward equation (13) for
(q, s)-bounded sets B ∈ B(X). In general, as the following example demonstrates, it is not
possible to extend (13) to all sets B ∈ B(X).

Example 2 For a set B ∈ B(X), Kolmogorov’s forward equation (13) does not hold at all
t ∈]u, T1[. Let X = Z, where Z denotes the set of integers, q(0,t) = 1, q(0,t, j) = 2−(| j|+1)
for all j 6= 0, and q( j,t, − j) = q( j,t) = 2| j| for all j 6= 0. If Xu = 0, then starting at time u
the process spends an exponentially distributed amount of time at state 0, then it jumps to a
state j 6= 0 with probability 2−(| j|+1), and then it oscillates between the states j and − j with
equal intensities. Thus for all u ∈ [T0, T1[ and t ∈]u, T1[

¯P(u, 0;t, 0) = e−(t−u)

and

¯P(u, 0;t, j) =

1 − e−(t−u)

2| j|+1

,

j 6= 0,

which implies

ZX

q(y,t, X \ {y}) ¯P(u, 0;t, dy) =ZX

= q(0,t) ¯P(u, 0;t, 0) + (cid:229)

q(y,t) ¯P(u, 0;t, dy)
q( j,t) ¯P(u, 0;t, j) = e−(t−u) + (cid:229)

(1 − e−(t−u)) = ¥

.

j6=0

j>0

Thus, if B = X, then (13) does not hold with P = ¯P because both integrals in (13) are inﬁnite.
⊓⊔

The following theorem describes the necessary and sufﬁcient condition for a function P
from ˆP to satisfy properties (i) and (ii) stated in Theorem 3. In other words, it provides a
necessary and sufﬁcient condition that a function P from ˆP satisﬁes Kolmogorov’s forward
equation. The necessity part of this theorem plays the central role in proving the minimality
property of ¯P stated in Theorem 3.
Theorem 4 Let Assumption 3 hold. A function P from ˆP satisﬁes properties (i) and (ii)
stated in Theorem 3 if and only if, for all u ∈ [T0, T1[, t ∈]u, T1[, x ∈ X, and B ∈ B(X),

Lemma 2 Under Assumption 3, the following statements hold:

(a) for each u ∈ [T0, T1[, s ∈]u, T1[, x ∈ X, and B ∈ B(X), the function ¯P(u, x;t, B) satisﬁes

the boundary condition (12) and is absolutely continuous in t ∈]u, s[.

(b) the function ¯P satisﬁes property (ii) stated in Theorem 3.

Proof (a) Under Assumption 2, statement (a) of this theorem is Theorem 4.1(i) in Feinberg
et al. [6], and the proof there is correct if (9) holds. In view of Lemma 1(c), formula (9) is
true under Assumption 3, and therefore, statement (a) of the lemma holds.

(b) Fix an arbitrary s ∈]T0, T1[. Observe that a Q function satisfying Assumption 3 sat-
isﬁes Assumption 2 with T1 = s. Then it follows from Feinberg et al. [6, Theorem 4.1(ii)]
that, for all u ∈ [T0, s[, x ∈ X, and (q, s)-bounded sets B ∈ B(X), the function ¯P(u, x;t, B)
satisﬁes Kolmogorov’s forward equation (13) for almost every t ∈]u, s[. Since s was chosen
arbitrarily, this fact implies that the function ¯P satisﬁes property (ii) stated in Theorem 3. ⊓⊔

To prove Theorems 3 and 4 we formulate and prove two lemmas. Lemmas 3 and 4
present Kolmogorov’s forward equation in integral forms (14), (17), which are equivalent to
its differential form (13). In particular, Theorem 4 follows from Lemma 4. Let u ∈ [T0, T1[,
s ∈]u, T1[, x ∈ X, and B ∈ B(X) be a (q, s)-bounded set. For any function P from ˆP,

q(y,t)P(u, x;t, dy) ≤  sup

y∈B,t∈]u,s[

q(y,t)!P(u, x;t, B) < ¥

ZB

,

t ∈]u, s[.

(15)

In addition, for u, s, x, and B described above, if the function P satisﬁes the boundary
condition (12) and is absolutely continuous in t ∈]u, s[, then it is bounded in t ∈]u, s[, which
along with (15) implies that

q(y, w)P(u, x; w, dy)dw < ¥

,

t ∈]u, s[.

Lemma 3 For arbitrary ﬁxed u ∈ [T0, T1[, s ∈]u, T1[, x ∈ X, and (q, s)-bounded set B ∈
B(X), a function P from ˆP satisﬁes the equality

(17)

if and only if it satisﬁes the boundary condition (12), is absolutely continuous in t ∈]u, s[,
and satisﬁes Kolmogorov’s forward equation (13) for almost every t ∈]u, s[.

Proof Suppose that a function P from ˆP satisﬁes the boundary condition (12), is absolutely
continuous in t ∈]u, s[, and satisﬁes Kolmogorov’s forward equation (13) for almost every
t ∈]u, s[ for u, s, x, and B described in the formulation of the lemma. Since every absolutely
continuous function is the integral of its derivative, equality (17) follows from integrating
equation (13) from u to t and using the boundary condition (12). In particular, both integrals
in equality (17) are ﬁnite because, in view of (16), the ﬁrst integral is ﬁnite.

Now, suppose (17) holds for u, s, x, and B described in the formulation of the lemma.
Observe that, for ﬁxed u, s, x, B, the real valued function P(u, x;t, B) is a constant plus the
the difference of two integrals from u to t of nonnegative integrable functions deﬁned for
w ∈]u, s[. Since an integral of an integrable function is an absolutely continuous function of
the upper limit of integration and its derivative is equal to the integrand almost everywhere
on its domain (Royden [16, Thms 10 on p. 107 and 14 on p. 110]), the function P(u, x;t, B) is

10

Feinberg et al.

absolutely continuous in t ∈]u, s[, and Kolmogorov’s forward equation (13) holds for almost
every t ∈]u, s[ for the ﬁxed u, s, x, and B. In addition, the absolute continuity of the integrals
in (17) implies that (12) holds.
⊓⊔

Lemma 4 Let u ∈ [T0, T1[, s ∈]u, T1[, x ∈ X, and C ∈ B(X) be a (q, s)-bounded set. A func-
tion P from ˆP satisﬁes the boundary condition (12), is absolutely continuous in t ∈]u, s[,
and satisﬁes Kolmogorov’s forward equation (13) for almost every t ∈]u, s[ if and only if it
satisﬁes equality (14) for all t ∈]u, s[ and B ∈ B(C).

Remark 2 The sufﬁciency statements of Theorem 4 and Lemma 4 are not used in the proofs
in this section.

Proof of Lemma 4 The following version of Fubini’s theorem from Halmos [9, Section 36,
Remark (3)] is used in the proof. Let (Z, S, m ) be a measure space with m (Z) < ¥
, and let
(Y, T) be a measurable space. Suppose that to almost every z ∈ Z there corresponds a ﬁnite
measure n z on T such that the function f (z) := n z(B) is measurable in z for each measurable
subset B of Y. Then, for any non-negative measurable function g on Y ,

where, for each measurable subset B of Y ,

Let us ﬁx P ∈ ˆP, u ∈ [T0, T1[, s ∈]u, T1[, x ∈ X, and a (q, s)-bounded set C ∈ B(X). To

(20)

Observe that, for j = 1, 2, the function G( j)(t, ·) is a measure on (C, B(C)) for every t ∈]u, s[,
and G( j)(·, B) is a measurable function on ]u, s[ for every B ∈ B(C).

Let t ∈]u, s[, w ∈]u,t[, and B ∈ B(C). Consider (Z, S, m ) = (X, B(X), P(u, x, w, ·)) and
for all

(Y, T) := (C, B(C)). For n z(·) = q+(z, w, ·), Assumption 3 implies that n z(Y ) < ¥

. Since the above equality holds for all t ∈]u, s[ for each
s ∈]u, T1[, formula (14) holds for all u ∈ [T0, T1[, t ∈]u, T1[, x ∈ X, and B ∈ B(X).
⊓⊔
Proof of Theorem 3 In view of Lemma 2, we need to prove only the minimality and unique-
ness properties of ¯P among functions from ˆP satisfying properties (i) and (ii) stated in The-
orem 3. Let P be a function from ˆP satisfying these properties. Let u ∈ [T0, T1[, t ∈]u, T1[,
x ∈ X, and B ∈ B(X). In view of Theorem 4, formula (14) holds. Since the last term in (14)
is non-negative,

P(u, x;t, B) ≥ I{x ∈ B}e−R t

u q(x,q )dq

= ¯P(0)(u, x;t, B),

where the last equality is (5). Assume that for some n = 0, 1, . . . ,

P(u, x;t, B) ≥

n(cid:229)

m=0

¯P(m)(u, x;t, B).

(41)

Then, from (8), (14), and (41), P(u, x;t, B) ≥ (cid:229) n+1
¯P(m)(u, x;t, B). Thus, by induction, (41)
m=0
holds for all n = 0, 1, . . . . Let n → ¥
. Then (41) and (7) imply that P(u, x;t, B) ≥ ¯P(u, x;t, B).
Therefore, the function ¯P is the minimal function from ˆP satisfying properties (i) and (ii)
stated in Theorem 3.

In conclusion, let the transition function ¯P be regular. If there is another function P,
which satisﬁes properties (i) and (ii) stated in Theorem 3 and takes values in [0, 1], then, since
¯P is the minimal solution, P(u, x;t, B) > ¯P(u, x;t, B) for some u ∈ [T0, T1[, x ∈ X, t ∈]u, T1[,
and B ∈ B(X). In addition, P(u, x;t, X \ B) ≥ ¯P(u, x;t, X \ B). Therefore, P(u, x;t, X) =
P(u, x;t, B) + P(u, x;t, X \ B) > ¯P(u, x;t, B) + ¯P(u, x;t, X \ B) = ¯P(u, x;t, X) = 1, and the in-
equality P(u, x;t, X) > 1 contradicts the property that P takes values in [0, 1].
⊓⊔

Theorems 3 and 4 imply the following two corollaries.

Corollary 1 Under Assumption 3, the following statements hold:

(a) for all u ∈ [T0, T1[, s ∈]u, T1[, x ∈ X, and (q, s)-bounded sets B, the function

¯P(u, x;t, B) satisﬁes (17).

(b) the function ¯P is the minimal function in ˆP for which statement (a) holds. In addi-
tion, if the transition function ¯P is regular, then ¯P is the unique function in ˆP with values in
[0, 1] for which statement (a) holds.
Proof In view of Lemma 3, any function P from ˆP satisﬁes statement (a) of the corollary if
and only if it satisﬁes properties (i) and (ii) stated in Theorem 3. Thus, the corollary follows

5 Kolmogorov’s forward equation for Q-functions bounded at each state

This section provides additional results on Kolmogorov’s forward equation when Assump-
tion 2 holds. Under Assumption 2 Kolmogorow’s forward equation is studied in Feinberg
et al. [6, Theorems 4.1, 4.3], and Corollary 5 is a more general statement than [6, Theorem
4.3]. In addition, Corollary 7 describes the minimality property of the function ¯P(T0, x;t, B)
that is useful for applications to continuous-time Markov decision processes.
Lemma 5 A function P ∈ ˆP satisﬁes for q-bounded sets B property (ii) stated in Theorem 3
if and only if, for all u ∈ [T0, T1[, x ∈ X, and q-bounded set B, the function P(u, x;t, B) satisﬁes
Kolmogorov’s forward equation (13) for almost every t ∈]u, T1[.

Proof The sufﬁciency statement of the lemma is straightforward. Let u ∈ [T0, T1[, x ∈ X,
and B ∈ B(X) be a q-bounded set. Let property (ii) stated in Theorem 3 hold for the q-
bounded set B. Consider an arbitrary sequence sn ↑ T1 as n → ¥ with s1 > u. Let Y be the
set of all t ∈]u, T1[ such that (13) does not hold at point t. It follows from property (ii) in
Theorem 3 that the Lebesgue measure of the sets Y ∩]u, sn[ is 0, n = 1, 2, . . . . This implies
that the Lebesgue measure of the set Y is 0. Therefore, the function P satisﬁes Kolmogorov’s
forward equation for almost every t ∈]u, T1[.
Corollary 3 A function P ∈ ˆP satisﬁes for q-bounded sets B property (i) and (ii) stated in
Theorem 3 if and only if the following two properties hold:

(a) for all u ∈ [T0, T1[, x ∈ X, and q-bounded sets B, the function P(u, x;t, B) satisﬁes the

boundary condition (12) and is absolutely continuous in t ∈]u, s[ for each s ∈]u, T1[;

(b) for all u ∈ [T0, T1[, x ∈ X, and q-bounded set B, the function P(u, x;t, B) satisﬁes

Kolmogorov’s forward equation (13) for almost every t ∈]u, T1[.

Proof For q-bounded sets B, property (i) stated in Theorem 3 coincides with property (a)
stated in the corollary. Lemma 5 implies that property (ii) stated in Theorem 3 holds for a
q-bounded set B if and only if property (b) stated in the corollary holds.
⊓⊔
Lemma 6 Under Assumption 2, a function P ∈ ˆP satisﬁes properties (i) and (ii) stated in
Theorem 3 if and only if it satisﬁes properties (a) and (b) stated in Corollary 3.

Proof Let the function P satisfy properties (i) and (ii) stated in Theorem 3. Since a q-
bounded set is (q, s)-bounded, it follows from Corollary 3 that properties (a) and (b) stated
in Corollary 3 hold.

Let properties (a) and (b) stated in Corollary 3 hold. Fix arbitrary u ∈ [T0, T1[, s ∈]u, T1[,
and x ∈ X. Lemma 4 implies that for every q-bounded set B equality (14) holds for all
t ∈]u, s[. In view of Assumption 2 and Lemma 1(a), there exist q-bounded sets B1, B2, . . .
n=1Bn. Let B ∈ B(X). Then Bn := Bn ∩ B, n =
such that Bn ⊆ Bn+1, n = 1, 2, . . . , and X = ∪
1, 2, . . . , are q-bounded sets. Therefore, for each set Bn, equality (14) holds for all t ∈]u, s[.
Since Bn ↑ B as n → ¥
, Lebesgue’s monotone convergence theorem implies that this formula
also holds for B. Thus, in view of Theorem 4, the function P satisﬁes properties (i) and (ii)
stated in Theorem 3.
⊓⊔

The following corollary generalizes Feinberg et al. [6, Theorem 4.1] since Assumption 3
is weaker than Assumption 2. We remark that absolute continuity in t ∈]u,¥
[ in [6, Theorem
4.1(i)] is meant in the sense that for each s ∈]u,¥
[ the function is absolutely continuous in
t ∈]u, s[. For T1 = ¥
this is equivalent to the absolutely continuity assumed in property (a)
stated in Corollary 3. For unbounded intervals, this type of absolute continuity is sometimes
called local absolute continuity.

Corollary 4 (cp. Feinberg et al. [6, Theorem 4.1]) Let Assumption 3 hold. Then, the function
¯P satisﬁes properties (a) and (b) stated in Corollary 3. In addition, property (a) stated in
Corollary 3 holds for all B ∈ B(X).

Proof In view of Lemma 2, the function ¯P satisﬁes properties (i) and (ii) stated in The-
orem 3. In particular, it satisﬁes these properties for the smaller class of q-bounded sets.
Thus, it follows from Corollary 3 that the function ¯P satisﬁes properties (a) and (b) stated
in Corollary 3. In addition, Lemma 2(a) implies that property (a) stated in Corollary 3 holds
for all B ∈ B(X).
⊓⊔

The following corollary has a more general formulation than [6, Theorem 4.3]. The dif-
ference is that Corollary 5 states that ¯P is the minimal solution within the class of functions
ˆP(x, u;t, B) that are absolutely continuous for all q-bounded sets B while [6, Theorem 4.3]
claims the minimality within the class of functions ˆP(x, u;t, B) that are a absolutely contin-
uous for all B ∈ B(X), and the former contains the later.

Corollary 5 (cp. Feinberg et al. [6, Theorem 4.3]) Let Assumption 2 hold. Then ¯P is the
minimal function in ˆP satisfying properties (a) and (b) stated in Corollary 3. Furthermore,
ˆP taking values in
if the transition function ¯P is regular, then ¯P is the unique element of
[0, 1] and satisfying properties (a) and (b) stated in Corollary 3.

Proof In view of Lemma 1(b), the corollary follows from Theorem 3 and Lemma 6.

⊓⊔

The following two corollaries from Corollary 5 are useful for applying the results of
this paper to continuous-time jump Markov decision processes; see Feinberg et al. [5, The-
orem 3.2].

Corollary 6 Under Assumption 2, the following statements hold:

(a) for all u ∈ [T0, T1[, x ∈ X, and q-bounded sets B ∈ B(X), the function ¯P(u, x;t, B)

satisﬁes the equality in formula (17) for all t ∈]u, T1[.

(b) the function ¯P is the minimal function in ˆP for which statement (a) holds. In addi-
tion, if the transition function ¯P is regular, then ¯P is the unique function in ˆP with values in
[0, 1] for which statement (a) holds.

Proof Lemma 3 and Corollary 3 imply that statement (a) of the corollary holds for a function
P from ˆP if and only if the function P satisﬁes properties (a) and (b) stated in Corollary 3.
Therefore, this corollary follows from Corollary 5.

When x is ﬁxed and u = T0, formula (17) is an equation in two variables t and B. Hence,
for simplicity, we write P(t, B) instead of P(T0, x;t, B) in (17) for any function P from ˆP
when x is ﬁxed and u = T0, and (17) becomes

P(t, B) = I{x ∈ B} +Z t

T0

dsZX

q(y, s, B \ {y})P(s, dy) −Z t

T0

dsZB

q(y, s)P(s, dy).

(42)

For ﬁxed x ∈ X and u = T0, the function ¯P(t, ·) is the marginal probability distribution of
the process {Xt : t ∈ [T0, T1[} at time t given XT0 = x. Under Assumption 2, the following
corollary describes the minimal solution of (42) and provides a sufﬁcient condition for its
uniqueness.

Corollary 7 Fix an arbitrary x ∈ X. Under Assumption 2, the following statements hold:
(a) for all t ∈]T0, T1[ and q-bounded sets B ∈ B(X), the function ¯P(t, B) satisﬁes (42);
(b) ¯P(t, B), where t ∈]T0, T1[ and B ∈ B(X), is the minimal non-negative function that
is a measure on (X, B(X)) for ﬁxed t, is measurable in t for ﬁxed B, and for which state-
ment (a) holds. In addition, if the function q(z,t) is bounded on the set X × [T0, T1[, then
¯P(t, B) is the unique non-negative function with values in [0, 1] and satisfying the conditions
stated in the ﬁrst sentence of this statement.

Proof Statement (a) of the corollary follows immediately from Corollary 6(a) when u =
T0. To prove statement (b), consider a non-negative function P(t, B), where t ∈]T0, T1[ and
B ∈ B(X), that satisﬁes the conditions given in the ﬁrst sentence of statement (b) of this
corollary. Deﬁne the function f (u, z;t, B) ∈ ˆP,

f (u, z;t, B) =(cid:26) P(t, B),

¯P(u, z;t, B),

if u = T0 and z = x,
otherwise.

(43)

Then, it follows from Corollary 6(a) and (43) that the function f satisﬁes the property given
in Corollary 6(a). Thus, Corollary 6(b) and (43) imply

P(t, B) = f (T0, x;t, B) ≥ ¯P(T0, x;t, B) = ¯P(t, B),

t ∈]T0, T1[, B ∈ B(X).

(44)

To show the uniqueness property, let the function P take values in [0, 1]. This fact and
the property that the function ¯P(u, z;t, B) takes values in [0, 1] for all u, z, t, B in the domain
of ¯P imply that the function f deﬁned in (43) takes values in [0, 1]. Observe that X is a q-
bounded set if the function q(z,t) is bounded on the set X × [T0, T1[. Then, as follows from
Corollary 6(a), ¯P(u, z;t, X) = 1 for all u ∈ [T0, T1[, t ∈]u, T1[, and z ∈ X. Therefore, it follows
from Corollary 6(b) that f (u, z;t, B) = ¯P(u, z;t, B) for all u, z,t, B in the domain of ¯P, which
along with (44) implies the uniqueness property of ¯P(t, B).
