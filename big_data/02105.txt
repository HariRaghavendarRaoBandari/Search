A NEW BICOMMUTANT THEOREM

I. FARAH

Abstract. We prove an analogue of Voiculescu’s theorem: Relative
bicommutant of a separable unital subalgebra A of an ultraproduct of
simple unital C*-algebras is equal to A.

Ultrapowers1 AU of separable algebras are, being subject to well-developed
model-theoretic methods, reasonably well-understood (see e.g.
[9, Theo-
rem 1.2] and §2). Since the early 1970s and the inﬂuential work of McDuﬀ
and Connes central sequence algebras A′ ∩ AU play an even more impor-
tant role than ultrapowers in classiﬁcation of II1 factors and (more recently)
C*-algebras. While they do not have a well-studied abstract analogue, in
[9, Theorem 1] it was shown that the central sequence algebra of a strongly
self-absorbing algebra ([17]) is isomorphic to its ultrapower. Relative com-
mutants B′ ∩ DU of separable subalgebras of ultrapowers of strongly self-
absorbing C*-algebras play an increasingly important role in classiﬁcation
program for separable C*-algebras ([12, §3], [4]; see also [16], [19]). We make
a step towards better understanding of these algebras.

Our setting is more general. C*-algebra is primitive if it has represen-
tation that is both faithful and irreducible. We prove an analogue of the
well-known consequence of Voiculescu’s theorem ([18, Corollary 1.9]) and
von Neumann’s bicommutant theorem (A
denotes the closure of A in
the weak operator topology).

At least two open problems are concerned with bicommutants of separable
subalgebras of massive operator algebras. As is well-known, central sequence
algebras M ′ ∩ M U of II1 factors in tracial ultrapowers behave diﬀerently
from the central sequence algebras of C*-algebras. For a II1 factor M with
separable predual the central sequence algebra M ′ ∩ M U can be abelian or
even trivial. Popa conjectured that if P is a separable subalgebra of an

ultraproduct of II1 factors then (P ′ ∩ QU Ni)′ = P implies P is amenable

([15, Conjecture 2.3.1]). In the domain of C*-algebras, Pedersen asked ([14,
Remark 10.11]) whether the following variant of Theorem 1 is true: If the
corona M (B)/B of a σ-unital C*-algebra B is simple and A is a separable
unital subalgebra, is (A′ ∩ M (B)/B)′ = A? (For the connection between
ultraproducts and coronas see the last paragraph of §3.)

The proof of Theorem 1 uses logic of metric structures ([3], [10]) and an

analysis of the interplay between C*-algebra B and its double dual B∗∗.

1. Model theory of representations

We expand the language of C*-algebras ([10, §2.3.1]) to representations
of C*-algebra. Reader’s familiarity with, or at least easy access to, [10,
§2] is assumed. A structure in the expanded language Lrep is a C*-algebra
together with its representation on a Hilbert space. As in [10], the domains
of quantiﬁcation on C*-algebra are Dn for n ∈ N and are interpreted as
the n-balls. The domains of quantiﬁcation on Hilbert space are DH
n for
n ∈ N and are also interpreted as the n-balls. On all domains the metric is
d(x, y) = kx − yk (we shall denote both the operator norm on C*-algebra
and the ℓ2-norm on Hilbert space by k · k). As in [10, §2.3.1], for every
λ ∈ C we have a unary function symbol λ to be interpreted as multiplication
by λ. We also have binary function + whose interpretation sends DH
m ×
DH
m+n. As the scalar product (·|·) is deﬁnable from the norm via
the polarization identity, we shall freely use it in our formulas, with the
understanding that (ξ|η) is an abbreviation for 1

n to DH

j=0 ijkξ + ijηk.

Language Lrep also contains a binary function symbol π whose interpre-
mn for all m and n. It is interpreted as an action

m to DH

tation sends Dn × DH
of A on H.

A NEW BICOMMUTANT THEOREM

3

Every variable is associated with a sort.

In particular variables x, y, z
range over the C*-algebra and variables ξ, η, ζ range over the Hilbert space,
all of them decorated with subscripts when needed.

We shall write ¯x for a tuple ¯x = (x1, . . . , xn) (with n either clear from
the context or irrelevant). Terms come in two varieties. On the C*-algebra
side, term is a noncommutative ∗-polynomial in C*-variables. On the Hilbert
space side terms are linear combinations of Hilbert space variables and ex-
pressions of the form π(α(¯x))ξ where α(¯x) is a term in the language of C*-
algebras. Formulas are deﬁned recursively. Atomic formulas are expressions
of the form ktk where t is a term.

The set of all formulas is the smallest set F containing all atomic formulas

with the following properties.

(i) for every n, all continuous f : [0, ∞)n → [0, ∞) and all ϕ1, . . . , ϕn in

F the expression f (ϕ1, . . . , ϕn) belongs to F and

(ii) if ϕ ∈ F and x, ξ are variable symbols then each of supkξk≤m ϕ,
inf kξk≤m ϕ, supkxk≤m ϕ and inf kxk≤m ϕ belongs to F (see [10, §2.4]).
Suppose π : A → B(H) is a representation of a C*-algebra A on Hilbert
space H. To (A, H, π) we associate the natural metric structure M(A, H, π)
in the above language.

Suppose ϕ(¯x, ¯ξ) is a formula whose free variables are included among ¯x
and ¯ξ.
If π : A → B(H) is a representation of a C*-algebra on Hilbert
space, ¯a are elements of A and ¯ξ are elements of H,2 then the interpretation
ϕ(¯a, ¯ξ)M(A,H,π) is deﬁned by recursion on the complexity of ϕ in the obvious
way (see [3, §3]).

Proposition 1.1. Triples (A, H, π) such that π is a representation of A on
H form an axiomatizable class.

Proof. As in [10, Deﬁnition 3.1], we need to deﬁne a Lrep-theory Trep such
that that the category of triples (A, H, π) where π : A → B(H) is a represen-
tation of a C*-algebra A is equivalent to the category of metric structures
that are models of Trep, via the map

(A, H, π) 7→ M(A, H, π).

We use the axiomatization of C*-algebras from [10, §3.1].
In addition to
the standard Hilbert space axioms, we need an axiom assuring that the
interpretation of DH

n equals the n-ball of the underlying Hilbert space:

kξk ≤ n

sup
kξk≤n

for all n and

(*) supkξk≤n(1 .− kξk) inf kηk≤1 kξ − ηk.

2Symbols ξ, η, ζ,. . . denote both Hilbert space variables and vectors in Hilbert space

due to the font shortage; this shall not lead to a confusion.

4

I. FARAH

The standard axioms,

π(xy)ξ = π(x)π(y)ξ,

π(x + y)ξ = π(x)ξ + π(y)ξ

(π(x)ξ|η) = (ξ|π(x∗)η)

are expressible as ﬁrst-order sentences.3 The axioms described here comprise
theory Trep.

One needs to check that the category of models of Trep is equivalent to the
category of triples (A, H, π). Every triple (A, H, π) uniquely deﬁnes a model
M(A, H, π). Conversely, assume M is a model of Trep. The algebra AM
obtained from the ﬁrst component of M is a C*-algebra by [10, Proposi-
tion 3.2]. Also, the linear space HM obtained from the second component
of M is a Hilbert space and the third component gives a representation πM
of A on H.

To see that this provides an equivalence of categories, we need to check
that M(AM, HM, πM) ∼= M for every model M of Trep. We need to show
that the domains on M are determined by AM and HM. The former was
proved in the second paragraph of [10, Proposition 3.2], and the latter follows
by (*).
(cid:3)

Proposition 1.1 gives us full access to the model-theoretic toolbox, such
as the  Lo´s’ theorem (see §2) and the L¨owenheim–Skolem Theorem ([10,
Theorem 4.6]). With it under our belt we shall identify triple (A, H, π)
with the associated metric structure M(A, H, π) and stop using the latter
notation.

Lemma 1.2. The following properties of a representation π of A are ax-
iomatizable:

(1) π is faithful
(2) π is irreducible.

Proof. We shall explicitly write the axioms for each of the properties of π.
Fix a representation π. It is faithful if and only if it is isometric, which can
be expressed as

sup
kxk≤1

inf
kξk≤1

|kxk − kπ(x)ξk| = 0.

Representation π is irreducible if and only if for all vectors ξ and η in H
such that kηk ≤ 1 and kξk = 1 the expression kη − π(a)ξk can be made
arbitrarily small when a ranges over the unit ball of A. In symbols (writing
s .− t := max(s − t, 0)),

sup
kξk≤1

sup
kηk≤1

inf
kxk≤1

|kξk .− 1|kη − π(x)ξk = 0.

The interpretation of this sentence in (A, H, π) is 0 if and only if π is irre-
ducible.
(cid:3)

3Our conventions are as described in [10, p. 485]. In particular α(x, ξ) = β(x, ξ) is an

abbreviation for supkxk≤n supξ kα(x, ξ) − β(x, ξ)k = 0, for all n.

A NEW BICOMMUTANT THEOREM

5

Triple (D, θ, K) is an elementary submodel of (B, π, H) (and (B, π, H) is
an elementary extension of (D, θ, K) if D ⊆ B, K ⊆ H θ(d) = π(d) ↾ H for
all d ∈ D, and

ϕ(¯a)(D,θ,K) = ϕ(¯a)(B,π,H)

for all formulas ϕ and all ¯a in (D, θ, K) of the appropriate sort. Axiomati-
zable properties, such as being irreducible or faithful, transfer between ele-
mentary submodels and elementary extensions. Therefore the Downwards
L¨owenheim–Skolem Theorem ([10, Theorem 4.6]) and Lemma 1.2 together
imply e.g. that if ϕ is a pure state of a nonseparable C*-algebra B then
B is an inductive limit of separable subalgebras D such that the restriction
of ϕ to D is pure. This fact was proved in [1] and its slightly more precise
version will be used in the proof of Lemma 3.2.

Other properties of representations (such as not being faithful) are ax-

iomatizable but we shall concentrate on proving Theorem 1.

2. Saturation and representations

It was known to logicians since the 1960s that the two deﬁning properties
of ultraproducts associated with nonprincipal ultraﬁlters on N in axioma-
tizable categories are  Lo´s’ Theorem ([10, Proposition 4.3]) and countable
saturation ([10, Proposition 4.11]). By the former, the diagonal embed-
ding of metric structure M into its ultrapower is elementary. More gener-
ally, if ϕ(¯x) is a formula and ¯a(j) ∈ Mj are of the appropriate sort then
ϕ(¯a)QU Mj = limj→U ϕ(¯a(j))Mj .

In order to deﬁne countable saturation, we review the notion of a type
from the logic of metric structures ([10, §4.3]). A condition is any expression
of the form ϕ ≤ r for formula ϕ and r ≥ 0 and type is a set of conditions ([10,
§4.3]). As every expression of the form ϕ = r is equivalent to the condition
max(ϕ, r) ≤ r and every expression of the form ϕ ≥ r is equivalent to
the condition min(0, r − ϕ) ≤ 0, we shall freely refer to such expressions
as conditions. For m and n in N such that m + n ≥ 1, (m, n)-type is a
type t such that all free variables occurring in conditions of t are among
{x1, . . . , xm} ∪ {ξ1, . . . , ξn}.

Given a structure (A, H, π) and a subset X of A ∪ H, we expand the lan-
guage Lrep by adding constants for the elements of X (as in [10, §2.4.1]). The
new language is denoted (Lrep)X . C*-terms in (Lrep)X are ∗-polynomials in
C*-variables and constants from X ∩ A. Hilbert space terms are linear com-
binations of Hilbert space variables, constants in X ∩ H, and expressions
of the form π(α)ξ where α is a C*-term in the expanded language. The
interpretation of (Lrep)X-formulas is deﬁned recursively in the natural way.
Type over X is a type in (Lrep)X . Such type is realized in some elementary
extension of (A, H, π) if the latter contains a tuple satisfying all conditions
from the type. A type is consistent if it is realized in some ultrapower of
(A, H, π). By  Lo´s’ Theorem, type t is consistent if and only every ﬁnite
subset of t is ε-realized in (A, H, π) for every ε > 0 ([10, Proposition 4.8]).

6

I. FARAH

A structure (A, H, π) is said to be countably saturated if every consistent
type over a countable (or equivalently, norm-separable) set is realized in
(A, H, π). Ultraproducts associated with nonprincipal ultraﬁlters on N are
always countably saturated ([10, Proposition 4.11]). A standard transﬁnite
back-and-forth argument shows that a structure of density character ℵ1 is
countably saturated if and only if it is an ultraproduct. (Density character
is the smallest cardinality of a dense subset.)

In the following, π will always be faithful and clear from the context and
we shall identify A with π(A) and suppress writing π. We shall therefore
write (A, H) in place of (A, H, id).

The following two lemmas are standard (they were used by Arveson in
the proof of Corollary 2 on p 344 of [2]) but we sketch the proofs for the
reader’s convenience.

Lemma 2.1. Suppose A is a C*-algebra and ϕ is a functional on A. Then
there are a representation π : A → B(K) and vectors ξ and η in K such that
ϕ(a) = (π(a)ξ|η) for all a ∈ A.

Proof. Let ¯ϕ be the unique extension of ϕ to a normal functional of the von
Neumann algebra A∗∗. By Sakai’s polar decomposition for normal linear
functionals (see e.g.
[13, Proposition 3.6.7]) there exists a normal state ψ
of A∗∗ and a partial isometry v such that ϕ(a) = ψ(av) for all a ∈ A∗∗. Let
π : A∗∗ → B(K) be the GNS representation corresponding to ψ. If η is the
corresponding cyclic vector and ξ = vη, then the restriction of π to A is as
required.
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.2. Suppose A is a proper unital subalgebra of C = C ∗(A, b).
Then there exists a representation π : C → B(K) and a projection q in
π(A)′ ∩ B(K) such that [q, b] 6= 0.

Proof. By the Hahn–Banach theorem there exists a functional ϕ on C of
norm 1 such that ϕ annihilates A and ϕ(b) = dist(A, b). Let π : C → B(K),
η and ξ be as guaranteed by Lemma 2.1. Let L be the norm-closure of π(A)ξ.
Since A is unital L 6= {0}. As 0 = ϕ(a) = (π(a)ξ|η) for all a ∈ A, η is
orthogonal to L and therefore the projection p to L is nontrivial. Clearly
p ∈ π(A)′ ∩B(K). Since (π(b)ξ|η) = ϕ(b) 6= 0, π(b) does not commute with p
and we therefore have q ∈ π(A)′ ∩ B(K) such that k[π(b), q]k > 0.
(cid:3)

The proof of Theorem 1 would be much simpler if Lemma 2.2 provided
an irreducible representation. This is impossible in general as the following
example shows. Let A be the unitization of the algebra of compact opera-
tors K(H) on an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space and let b be a projection
in B(H) Murray-von Neumann equivalent to 1 − b. Then C = C ∗(A, b) has
(up to equivalence) three irreducible representations. Two of those repre-
sentations annihilate A and send b to a scalar, and the third is faithful and
the image of b is in the weak operator closure of the image of A.

A NEW BICOMMUTANT THEOREM

7

It is well-known that for a Banach space X the double dual X ∗∗ can be
embedded into an ultrapower of X ([11, Proposition 6.7]). Here is a C*-
algebraic variant of this fact (as in [13, 3.3.6], two representations π1 and
π2 of A are equivalent if the identity map on A extends to an isomorphism
between π1(A)′′ and π2(A)′′).
Lemma 2.3. Assume (QU Bj,QU Hj) is an ultraproduct of faithful irre-

ducible representations of unital C*-algebras and C is a unital separable
subalgebra of BU .

(1) If C ∩ K(QU Hj) = {0} then the induced representation of C on

QU Hj is equivalent to the universal representation of C.

(2) In general, if

p = _{q : q is a projection in C ∩ K(YU

Hj)}

then p ∈ C ′ and c 7→ (1 − p)c is equivalent to the universal represen-

tation of C/(C ∩ K(QU Hj)) on (1 − p)QU Hj.

Proof. For a state ψ on C the (0, 1)-type tψ(ξ) of a vector ξ implementing
ψ consists of all conditions of the form (aξ|ξ) = ψ(a) for a ∈ C. (1) Fix
state ψ on C. By Glimm’s Lemma ([5, Lemma II.5.1]) type tψ is consistent

with the theory of (QU Bj,QU Hj). By the separability of C and countable
saturation, there exists a unit vector η ∈ QU Hj such that ψ(c) = (cη|η)
for all c ∈ C. Let L be the norm-closure of Cη in QU Hj. Then L is

a reducing subspace for C and the induced representation of C on L is
spatially isomorphic to the GNS representation of C corresponding to ψ.
Since ψ was arbitrary, by [13, Theorem 3.8.2] this completes the proof.

(2) If a ∈ C is such that qa 6= 0 for some projection q ∈ C ∩ K(QU Hj),
then a(1 − p) = 0. Therefore p ∈ C ′ ∩ B(QU Hj). Let pn, for n ∈ N, be a
maximal family of orthogonal projections in C ∩ K(QU Hj). It is countable
by the separability of C and p = Wn pn. Let ψ be a state of C that annihilates
C ∩ K(QU Hj). Let t+
ψ (ξ) be the type obtained from tψ(ξ) by adding to it
all conditions of the form pnξ = 0 for n ∈ N. By Glimm’s Lemma (as stated
in [5, Lemma II.5.1]) the type t+
ψ (ξ) is consistent, and by the countable
saturation we can ﬁnd ξ1 ∈ QU Hj that realizes this type. Then pξ1 = 0
and therefore ξ1 ∈ (1 − p)QU Hj. Therefore every GNS representation of
C/(C ∩ K(QU Hj)) is spatially equivalent to a subrepresentation of c 7→

(1 − p)c, and by [13, Theorem 3.8.2] this concludes the proof.

(cid:3)

3. Double dual and Day’s device

The natural embedding of a C*-algebra B into its double dual B∗∗ is
rarely elementary. For example, the existence of a nontrivial projection is
axiomatizable and B∗∗, being a von Neumann algebra, has an abundance
of projections while B may have no nontrivial projections at all. However,
certain inf-formulas with parameters in B have the same interpretation in B

8

I. FARAH

and in B∗∗, and this will suﬃce for our purposes. We shall consider the
language (Lrep)B expanded by adding new constants for parameters in B
(see §2). A term α(x) is linear if it is of the form xa+bx for some parameters
a and b.

A restricted B-linear formula is a formula of the form
(1) maxj≤m kαj(x) − bjk + maxj≤n(rj

.− kβj (x)k)

where

(2) all bj, for 1 ≤ j ≤ m are parameters in B,
(3) all rj, for 1 ≤ j ≤ n are positive real numbers,
(4) all αj for 1 ≤ j ≤ m are linear terms with parameters in B, and
(5) all βj for 1 ≤ j ≤ n are linear terms with parameters in B.
Proof of the following is based on a method ﬁrst used by Day ([6]; see also

[7, Section 2] for some uses of this method in the theory of C*-algebras).

Lemma 3.1. Suppose B is a unital C*-algebra and

γ(x) = max
j≤m

kαj(x) − bjk + max
j≤n

(rj

.− kβj(x)k).

is a restricted B-linear formula. Then the following are equivalent.

(6) inf x∈B γ(x) = 0
(7) inf x∈B∗∗ γ(x) = 0.

Proof. (6) implies (7). because B is isomorphic to a unital subalgebra of B∗∗
and therefore inf x∈B∗∗ γ(x) ≤ inf x∈B γ(x).

Assume (7) holds. Let aj and cj, for j ≤ n, be such that αj(x) = ajx+xcj.
For each j we shall identify αj with its interpretation, linear map from B
to B. The second adjoint α∗∗
j (x) = ajx + xcj,
hence α∗∗

j (x) is the interpretation of the term αj(x) in B∗∗. The set

j : B∗∗ → B∗∗ also satisﬁes α∗∗

Z := hαj(x) : x ∈ B≤1i

is, being an image of a convex set under a linear map, a convex subset of Bm
and by the Hahn–Banach theorem

Z1 := Bm ∩ hαj(x) : x ∈ B∗∗
≤1i

is included in the norm-closure of Z. By (7) we have (b1, . . . , bm) ∈ Z1.

Fix ε > 0 and let X1 := {x ∈ B≤1 : maxj≤m kαj(x) − bjk ≤ ε}. By the
above this is a convex subset of the unit ball of B and (by the Hahn–
Banach again) the weak∗-closure of X1 in B∗∗ is equal to {x ∈ B∗∗
≤1 :
maxj≤m kαj(x) − bjk ≤ ε}.

Let c ∈ B∗∗

≤1 be such that γ(c) < ε. Then c belongs to the weak∗-closure
of X1. For each j ≤ n we have kβj (c)k > rj − ε. Fix a norming functional
ϕj ∈ B∗ such that kϕjk = 1 and ϕj(βj(c)) > rj − ε. Then

U := {x ∈ B∗∗ : ϕj(βj(x)) > rj − ε for all j}

is a weak∗-open neighbourhood of c and, as c belongs to the weak∗-closure
of X1, U ∩ X1 is a nonempty subset of B≤1. Any b ∈ U ∩ X1 satisﬁes
γ(b) < ε. As ε > 0 was arbitrary, this shows that (6) holds.

suppose that there exists q ∈ A′ ∩ B(QU Hj) such that k[q, b]k = r > 0. We

Consider the (1, 0)-type t(x) consisting of all conditions of the form

k[x, b]k ≥ r

and [x, a] = 0

for a ∈ A. This type is satisﬁed in B(QU Hj) by q. Since all formulas

in t(x) are quantiﬁer-free, their interpretation is unchanged when passing
to a diﬀerent algebra. Although in general a quantiﬁer-free type realized in
a larger algebra is not necessarily consistent with the theory of the smaller
algebra, Lemma 3.1 implies that in our situation this is the case.

Suppose (Bj, Hj) is a faithful irreducible representation of Bj on Hj

C := C ∗(A, b).

By (2) of Lemma 3.2 we have A

WOT

such that r = dist(b, A) > 0. By (1) of Lemma 3.2 it suﬃces to ﬁnd

for j ∈ N and A is a separable subalgebra of QU Bj. By Lemma 1.2
(QU Bj,QU Hj) is an irreducible faithful representation of QU Bj.
∩ QU Bj = (A′ ∩ QU Bj)′. Since
A ⊆ (A′ ∩QU Bj)′, it remains to prove (A′ ∩QU Bj)′ ⊆ A. Fix b ∈ QU Bj
d ∈ A′ ∩ B(QU Hj) such that [d, b] 6= 0. Let
By Lemma 2.3 it suﬃces to ﬁnd a representation π : C/(C ∩ K(QU Hj)) →
B(K) and q ∈ π(A)′ ∩ B(K) such that [q, π(b)] 6= 0. If C ∩ K(QU Hj) = {0}
Let us now consider the general case when C ∩ K(QU Hj) is nontrivial.
projections in A ∩ K(QU Hj). The index-set J is countable (and possibly

then Lemma 2.2 implies the existence of such a representation, concluding
the proof in this case.

Let pn, for n ∈ J, be an enumeration of a maximal orthogonal set of minimal

ﬁnite or empty) since A is separable.

Suppose for a moment that there exists n such that pnbpn /∈ A. Since
the range of pn is ﬁnite-dimensional, by the Kadison Transitivity Theorem

pnbpn /∈ (A′∩B(QU Hj))′. By Lemma 3.2 we conclude pnbpn /∈ (A′∩QU Bj)′
and therefore b /∈ (A′ ∩QU Bj)′.
Let p = Wn pn. By (2) of Lemma 2.3 p ∈ A′ ∩ B(QU Hj), and we may
therefore assume [b, p] = 0. This implies that A ∩ K(QU Hj) is an ideal of C.

Let θ : C → C/(A∩K) be the quotient map. We claim that dist(θ(b), θ(A)) =
dist(b, A) > 0. Let r := dist(b, A). Fix a ∈ A. We need to show that
kθ(a − b)k ≥ r.

Consider the (0, 1)-type t(ξ) consisting of all conditions of the form

kξk = 1,

k(a − b)ξk ≥ r,

pnξ = 0,

for n ∈ J. To see that this type is consistent ﬁx a ﬁnite F ⊆ J. Let

q := Pn∈F pn and

a′ := (1 − q)a(1 − q) + Xn∈F

pnbpn.

As both summands belong to A, a′ ∈ A and therefore ka′ − bk ≥ r. Fix

then ξ′ = (1 − q)ξ has the same property since (a′ − b)q = 0. Since ε > 0
was arbitrary, t(ξ) is consistent. By the countable saturation there exists a

ε > 0. If ξ ∈ QU Hj is a vector of norm ≤ 1 such that k(a′ − b)ξk > r − ε
unit vector ξ ∈ QU Hj which realizes t(ξ). Since pnξ = 0 for all n we have

pξ = 0 and therefore kθ(a − b)k ≥ k(1 − p)(a − b)(1 − p)k ≥ r. Since a ∈ A
was arbitrary, we conclude that dist(θ(b), θ(A)) = r.

equivalent to the universal representation of C. Hence by Lemma 2.2 we

Suppose for a moment that (1 − p)C(1 − p) ∩ K(QU Hj) = {0}. By
(2) of Lemma 2.3 representation C ∋ c 7→ (1 − p)c ∈ B((1 − p)QU Hj) is
can ﬁnd d ∈ (1 − p)(A′ ∩ B(QU Hj)) that does not commute with b, and by
We may therefore assume that (1 − p)C(1 − p) ∩ K(QU Hj) 6= {0}. By the

spectral theorem for self-adjoint compact operators and continuous func-
tional calculus, there exists a nonzero projection q ∈ (1 − p)C(1 − p) of ﬁnite
rank. Fix c ∈ C such that (1 − p)c(1 − p) = q.

the above this concludes the proof in this case.

By Lemma 3.2 it suﬃces to ﬁnd d ∈ A′ ∩ (1 − p)B(QU Hj)(1 − p) such
that [d, c] 6= 0. Suppose otherwise, that c ∈ (A′ ∩QU Bj)′. (2) of Lemma 3.2

implies that c ∈ A
. By the Kaplansky Density Theorem there is a net
of positive contractions in A converging to c in the weak operator topology.
By the continuous functional calculus and the Kadison Transitivity Theorem
we may choose this net among the members of

WOT

Z := {a ∈ A+ : kak = 1, qaq = q}.

Consider the (0, 1)-type t1(ξ) consisting of all conditions of the form

kξk = 1,

aξ = ξ,

qξ = 0,

pnξ = 0

for n ∈ N and a ∈ Z.

We claim that t1(ξ) is consistent. Fix ε > 0 and a1, a2, . . . , an in Z. Let

a := a1a2 . . . an−1anan−1 . . . a2a1.

Then a ∈ Z and q ≤ a. By the choice of p the operator (1 − p)(a − s)
is not compact for any s < 1. Therefore there exists a unit vector ξ0 in

(1 − p − q)QU Hj such that kξ0 − aξ0k is arbitrarily small. By the countable
saturation there exists a unit vector ξ1 ∈ (1 − (p + q))QU Hj such that

aξ1 = ξ1. As each aj is a positive contraction, we have ajξ1 = ξ1 for
1 ≤ j ≤ n. Since a1, . . . , an was an arbitrary subset of Z, this shows that
t1(ξ) is consistent. Since Z is separable, by the countable saturation there

exists ξ ∈ QU Hj realizing t1(ξ). Then ξ is a unit vector in (1−(p+q))QU Hj

such that aξ = ξ for all a ∈ Z. As cξ = 0, this is in contradiction with c
being in the weak operator topology closure of Z. This concludes the proof.

I. FARAH

Proof. (1) is a consequence of the Kadison transitivity theorem and count-

able saturation of the structure (QU Bj,QU Hj). Let pn, for n ∈ N, be an

increasing sequence of ﬁnite-dimensional projections converging to pK in the
strong operator topology and let an, for n ∈ N, be a dense subset of A. We
need to check that the type t(x) consisting of all conditions of the form

kpn(x − T )pnk = 0,

kxk = kT k

ducible by Lemma 1.2, every ﬁnite subset of t(x) is consistent by the Kadison

for n ∈ N is consistent. Since the representation of QU Bj on QU Hj is irre-
Transitivity Theorem. We can therefore ﬁnd b ∈ QU Bj that satisﬁes t(x)

and therefore pKbpK = T and kbk = kT k.

(2) If T is self-adjoint, add the condition x = x∗ to t(x). By [13, The-
orem 2.7.5] the corresponding type is consistent, and the assertion again
follows by countable saturation. The case when T is a unitary also uses [13,
Theorem 2.7.5].
(cid:3)

An important consequence of full Voiculescu’s theorem is that any two
unital representations πj : A → B(H) of a separable unital C*-algebra A on
H such that ker(π1) = ker(π2) and π1(A) ∩ K(H) = π2(A) ∩ K(H) = {0}
are approximately unitarily equivalent ([18, Corollary 1.4]). The analogous
statement is in general false for the ultraproducts. Let Bn = Mn(C) for

n ∈ N and let A = C2. Group K0(QU Mn(C)) is isomorphic to ZN with

the natural ordering and the identity function id as the order-unit. Every
unital representation of A corresponds to an element of this group that
lies between 0 and id and there are 2ℵ0 inequivalent representations. Also,
Z and 2ℵ0 of these

K0(QU Mn(C)) is isomorphic to the ultraproduct QU

extensions remain inequivalent even after passing to the ultraproduct.
