The variance of the incipient inﬁnite cluster in two-dimensional

percolation

Yu Zhang

March 22, 2016

Abstract

Consider bond percolation on the square lattice. Let C be the incipient inﬁnite cluster with the
incipient measure ν. If a one-arm path exponent exists and equals 5/48, it is well known that Eν|C ∪
[−n, n]2| = n91/48+o(1).
In this paper, we focus on the variance of |C ∪ [−n, n]2| and show that
ν (|C ∪ [−n, n]2|) = n91/24+o(1).

Introduction and statement of results.

Consider bond percolation on the square lattice Z2. For a given (x, y) ∈ Z2, its nearest four neighbors are
deﬁned as (x ± 1, y) and (x, y ± 1). Edges between neighboring or adjacent vertices therefore correspond
to vertical or horizontal displacements of one unit. Each edge is independently open with probability p or
closed with probability 1 − p. The corresponding probability measure on the conﬁgurations of open and
closed edges is denoted by Pp. We also denote by Ep and σp the expectation and the variance with respect
to Pp. A path from u to v is a sequence (v0, e1, v1, ..., vi−1, ei, vi, ..., vn) with adjacent vertices vi and vi+1
by edge ei such that v0 = u and vn = v. A circuit is a path with distinct vertices vi (1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1) except
v0 = vn. A path is called open or closed if all of its edges are open or closed. The occupied cluster of the
vertex x, C(x), consists of all open edges that are connected to x by an open path. For any collection A
of vertices, |A| denotes the cardinality of A. We choose 0 as the origin.

The percolation probability is

and the critical probability is

θ(p) = Pp(|C(0)| = ∞),

pc = sup{p : θ(p) = 0}.

It is well known (see chapter 3 in Kesten (1982)) that for bond percolation on the square lattice

pc = 0.5.

(1.1)

It is also well known that there is no inﬁnite open cluster at pc. However, the mean open cluster size
is inﬁnity at pc. In other words, there should be a large open cluster around the origin at pc. Kesten

AMS classiﬁcation: 60K35.
Key words and phrases: percolation, incipient inﬁnite cluster, variance, critical exponents.

(1986) proposed building an inﬁnite open cluster by conditioning on the existence of a large cluster at
the origin. More precisely, for any cylinder event A, we write

νn(A) = Ppc(A | 0 → ∂[−n, n]2),

where A → B means that there is an open path from A to B. Kesten (1986) proved that

lim
n→∞

νn(A) = ν(A) for a cylinder event A.

(1.2)

The probability measure ν is called the incipient measure. Let Eν(·) and σ2
ν(·) be the expected value
and the variance respect with measure to ν. It is clear that the origin has ν-probability one of being
in an inﬁnite open cluster C. Physicists are interested in the geometry of the inﬁnite incipient cluster.
They believe that C should have a fractal between one and two. Before introducing the geometry results
for the inﬁnite incipient cluster, we would like to introduce a few basic estimates in percolation. Let us
introduce k-arm paths. Let B(n) = [−n, n]2 and Be(n) be all the edges in [−n, n]2. Consider the annulus

A(m, n) = {B(n) \ B(m)} ∪ {∂B(m)} for m < n.

Let Qk(b, m, n) be the event that there exist i disjoint occupied paths and j disjoint vacant paths with
i + j = k for all i, j ≥ 1 from b + ∂B(m) to b + ∂B(n) inside A(m, n). We call them k-arm paths. For
simplicity, let Qk(m, n) = Qk(0, m, n) and Qk(n) = Qk(0, 0, n). It is believed by Aizenman, Dulpantier,
and Alharony (1999) that

for k ≥ 2 and

Ppc(Qk(m, n)) = (cid:18) m

n (cid:19)(k2−1)/12+o(1)

Ppc(Q1(m, n)) = (cid:18) m

n (cid:19)5/48+o(1)

(1.3)

(1.4)

for a ﬁxed m as n → ∞. In fact, it is more important to show (1.3) when k = 4. Fortunately, by using the
Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) argument and Smirnov’s scaling limit on the triangular lattice, (1.3)
and (1.4) were proved (see Lawler, Schramm, and Werner (2002) for k = 1 and Smirnov and Werner’s
Theorem 4 (2001) for k = 4). Let Tn = |C ∩ [−n, n]2|. One of most important questions is to ask what
the fractal of Tn is. With (1.4), Kesten (1987) showed that

Eν Tn = n2−5/48+o(1) = n91/48+o(1).

(1.5)

In this paper, we investigate the variance of Tn to show the following result.

Theorem. For each n, if (1.4) holds, then

ν(Tn) = n91/24+o(1).

Remarks. 1. By Kesten’s argument in (1986) (see (2.1) below), we know that

EνT 2

n = n91/24+o(1).

(1.6)

ν(Tn) ≈ EνT 2

n . This tells us that Tn has a very large variance as the same order as its second

Thus, σ2
moments. In other words, Tn has a very large tail.
2. We may deﬁne Sn be the number of vertices in B(n) connecting to ∂B(2n) by open paths. By (1.4),
it is easy to obtain that

Similarly, by Kesten’s argument above, it can be show that

Epc(Sn) = n2−5/48+o(1).

EpcS2

n = n4−5/24+o(1) = n91/24+o(1).

We want to mention that by using the same proof of Theorem 1, we can also show that

σ2
pc(Sn) = n4−5/24+o(1) = n91/24+o(1).

(1.7)

If p > pc, then there is an inﬁnite open cluster from the origin with a positive probability. On the
existence of this cluster, we may still denote by Tn the open cluster from the origin inside B(n). By
Theorem 4 in Zhang (2001),

σ2
p(Tn) ≈ n.

Furthermore, Tn satisﬁes the central limit theorem (CLT) if p > pc. However, since Tn has a large tail,
we do not think that Tn satisﬁes the CLT at pc.
3. For the triangular lattice, since (1.4) holds as we mentioned above, the result of the theorem will hold
for the triangular lattice. Similarly, if (1.4) holds for the other two-dimensional lattices, we can also show
the theorem for these lattices.

2 Preliminaries.

In this section, we introduce a few basic properties and estimates of bond percolation in the square lattice.
Most results are obtained from Kesten (1982) and (1987). For any u, v ∈ Z2, let d(u, v) be the Euclidean
distance between u and v. We deﬁne the dual lattice Z∗2 = {v + (0.5, 0.5) : v ∈ Z2} and edges joining
all pairs of vertices, which are a unit distance apart. For each edge set A, we may denote by A∗ its dual
edges. For example, e∗ is bisected by the edge e. Given a ﬁnite connected graph G, a vertex u 6∈ G, but
is adjacent to G, is called the boundary of G. We denote by ∂G the boundary vertices of G. If a vertex
v ∈ ∆G, and there is an inﬁnite path from v without using G, then v is called the exterior boundary.
We denote by ∆G the exterior boundary of G. The edges not in G, but adjacent to ∆G, are called the
exterior edges. We introduce a topology result (see Lemma 2.23 in Kesten (1982) or Proposition 11.2 in
Grimmett (1999)).

Lemma 2.1. If G is a ﬁnite cluster, then ∆G is a circuit containing G in its interior. Furthermore,

∆G is the smallest vacant circuit containing G in its interior if G is occupied.

At pc, by symmetry, we can show that there is an open crossing or a closed dual crossing in any
square with a positive probability at pc. We can also extend this crossing two times longer with a positive
probability by using the RSW lemma. Together with the FKG inequality, we can show that there is an

3

open or closed dual circuit with a positive probability in any annulus A(n, 2n). We still call this argument
the RSW lemma.

By using (43)–(53) in Kesten (1986), we know that for any l ≥ 1 there exists C = C(l) > 0 such that

EνT l

n ≤ C(EνTn)l = nl(2−5/48+o(1)).

Similarly, by the exact proof in Kesten’s above estimate, we still have

EpcSl

n ≤ C(EpcSn)l = nl(2−5/48+o(1)).

By (2.2) and Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality, we have the followng lemma.

(2.1)

(2.2)

Lemma 2.2. For any ǫ > 0, there exists a positive constant C1 independent of n such that

Ppc (Sn ≥ n2−5/48−ǫ) ≥ C1.

Given four-arm paths in a square B(n) and four-arm paths in an annulus A(n, m) for n < m, one of
the major estimates (see Lemma 4 and Lemma 6 in Kesten (1987)) is to reconnect them by costing a
constant probability independent of n and m. It is a more general argument than the RSW lemma since
the RSW lemma only reconnects the open or closed paths. This connection is called the reconnection
lemma.

Reconnection lemma. (Kesten (1987)). For n ≤ m, there exists C > 0 (independent of n, m) such

that

Ppc(Q4(n)Pp(Q4(n, m))) ≤ CPpc(Q4(m)).

In fact, in Kesten’s reconnection lemma, if there are four-arm paths, then we can restrict the four-arm
paths in special locations. More precisely, we denote by E4(k) the event that there are four-arm paths
from some edge e and e∗ in B(2k−1) to ∂B(2k). We deﬁne the sub-event ¯E4(2k) of E4(2k) such that there
are four-arm paths r1, r∗

4 from e and e∗ in E4(2k) with (see Fig. 1)

2, r3, and r∗

r1 ∩ A(2k−1, 2k) ⊂ A1 := [−2k, −2k−1] × [−2k−1, 2k−1],
r3 ∩ A(2k−1, 2k) ⊂ A3 := [2k−1, 2k] × [−2k−1, 2k−1],
r∗
2 ∩ A(2k−1, 2k) ⊂ A2 := [−2k−1, 2k−1] × [2k−1, 2k],
r∗
4 ∩ A(2k−1, 2k) ⊂ A4 := [−2k−1, 2k−1] × [−2k, −2k−1].

In addition, we require that there exist an open vertical crossing on Ai for i = 1, 3 and a horizontal
vacant dual crossing on A∗
i for i = 2, 4. These extra vertical and horizontal crossings are called wings.
Kesten’s Lemma 4 (see Kesten (1987)) showed that there exists C > 0 such that for all k,

Ppc(E4(2k)) ≤ CPpc( ¯E4(2k)).

(2.3)

4

Here we want to remark that Kesten’s proof in (2.3) is for four-arm paths from a ﬁxed edge. However,
the exact proof can show our situation.

It is also easier to handle a one arm path in this way. We may replace E4(k) and ¯E4(k) with E1(k)

and ¯E1(k) by ignoring the paths r∗

2, r3, and r∗

4. We can use the same argument of (2.3) to show that

Ppc(E1(2k)) ≤ CPpc( ¯E1(2k)).

(2.4)

For n < m, we also deﬁne G1(k) to be the event that there is an open path r1 from the origin to ∂B(2k).
In addition, let ¯G1(k) be the sub-event of G1(k) such that r1 also crosses A1 vertically. It also follows
from the same argument of (2.4) that

Ppc(G1(2k)) ≤ CPpc( ¯G1(2k)).

(2.5)

We want to point out that the proof of (2.5) can be shown directly by using the FKG inequality and
the RSW lemma since we only need to deal with open paths, positive events. The proofs of Kesten’s
Lemma 4 is much more complicated since they need to deal with both open and closed paths, positive
and negative events.

For each e ∈ B(n) with two vertices v′ = v′(e) and v′′ = v′′(e), e is called a pivotal for the connection
of v′(e) and the origin if there is or isn’t an open path inside B(n) from v′(e) to the origin if e is open
or closed. By Lemma 2.1, it is easy to verify that if e is pivotal, then there is a dual path D∗(v′) from
one vertex of e∗ to the other inside B(n) such that all of its edges, except e∗ and its edges on ∂B(n), are
closed, and there is an open path from v′′(e) to the origin (see Fig. 2). Together with e∗, D∗(v′) ∪ e∗ is
a circuit, and the circuit separates v′(e) from v′′(e). Note that there might be many such circuits. We
always select one containing the smallest number of edges. It follows from Lemma 2.1 (see Fig. 2) that
D(v′) is the exterior boundary of the open cluster of v′(e). We denote by ¯D(v′) the open cluster of v′(e).
Let Hǫ(e) be the event that e is pivotal for v′(e), and D∗(v′) does not contain the edges in ∂B∗(n), and
|B(n) ∩ ¯D(v′)| ≥ n2−5/48−ǫ. Note that e can be either open or closed independent of Hǫ(e). On Hǫ(e), if
e is changed from open to closed, then C will lose at least n2−5/48−ǫ many vertices.

Lemma 2.3. If Hǫ = ∪e∈B(n)H(e), then for each ǫ > 0 there is a constant C > 0 (independent of ǫ

and n) such that

In addition, there exists a constant Ci for i = 1, 2 such that

Pν(Hǫ) ≥ C.

0.5Pν (Hǫ(e)) = Pν (Hǫ(e), e is open) = Pν (Hǫ(e), e is closed).

Proof. We focus on S = [n/16, 3n/16]2. Let v be the center of S. By using the RSW lemma, there
exists an edge e in v + [n/8, n/8]2 such that E4(v, n/8) occurs with a positive probability, where E4(v, n/8)
is the same event E4(n/8) by shifting each conﬁguration from the origin to v. That is,

Ppc(E4(v, n/8)) ≥ C1.

(2.6)

In fact, Kesten, Sidoravicius, and Zhang (1998) can show that there exist ﬁve-arm paths with a positive
probability. By (2.4), we have

Ppc( ¯E4(v, n/8)) ≥ C1.

Figure 1: The ﬁgure shows how to construct a few events together such that Hǫ occurs. N (Γ) is all vertices
in [5n/16, 7n/16] × [n/16, 3n/16] such that each of them is connected to Γ by an open path. E4(v, n/8) is
the event that there are four-arm paths from e and these closed paths have two wings.

Here we only need the closed wings in A2 and A4. On ¯E4(v, n/8), we deﬁne the following events (see
Fig. 1). Let D1(n) be the event that there is a closed dual path from [n/16, 3n/16] × {3n/16} to
[n/16, 3n/16] × {n/16} inside annulus

B1 = [n/16, 11n/16] × [−3n/16, 7n/16] \ [3n/16, 9n/16] × [−n/16, 5n/16].

Let D2(n) be the event that there is an open circuit in annulus

B2 = [3n/16, 9n/16] × [−n/16, 5n/16] \ [5n/16, 7n/16] × [n/16, 3n/16].

On D2(n), there might be many such circuits. We assume that D2(n) is the largest circuit among all the
circuits. By Proposition 2.3 in Kesten (1982), if D2(n) = Γ for a ﬁxed circuit Γ, then

conﬁgurations of edges inside ˙Γ and outside ˙Γ are independent,

(2.8)

where ˙Γ is the edges enclosed by Γ, but not in Γ. On D2(n) = Γ for a ﬁxed Γ, let N (Γ) be the event
that there are more than n2−5/48−ǫ many vertices inside [5n/16, 7n/16] × [n/16, 3n/16] such that each is
connected to Γ by open paths. Let N (D2(n)) = ∪ΓN (Γ). By Lemma 2.2, there exists C2 > 0 such that

Ppc(N (Γ) | D2(n) = Γ) ≥ Ppc(Sn/8 ≥ n5/48−ǫ) ≥ C2.

(2.9)

Let G2(n) be the event that there is an open vertical crossing in [−n/16, n/16] × [n/16, n]. Let D3(n)
be the event that there is an open circuit in the annulus A(11n/16, n), and let G(n, m) be the event that

6

there is an open path from B(11n/16) to ∂B(m). Now we put these events together. For any δ > 0, we
take m large such that

Pν (Hǫ) = lim
m→∞

P −1

pc (0 → ∂B(m))Ppc (Hǫ ∩ 0 → ∂B(m))

≥ P −1

pc (0 → ∂B(m))Ppc (Hǫ ∩ 0 → ∂B(m)) − δ.

(2.10)

Let us focus on Ppc(Hǫ ∩ 0 → ∂B(m)). As we deﬁned these events (see Fig. 1),

Ppc(Hǫ ∩ 0 → ∂B(m))

≥ Ppc( ¯E4(n/8) ∩ D1(n) ∩ D2(n) ∩ D3(n) ∩ N (D2(n)) ∩ ¯G1(n) ∩ G2(n) ∩ G(n, m)).

(2.11)

Note that open paths and closed paths are positive and negative events, so by Lemma 3 in Kesten (1987),

Ppc( ¯E4(n/8) ∩ D1(n) ∩ D2(n) ∩ D3(n) ∩ N (D2(n)) ∩ ¯G1(n) ∩ G2(n) ∩ G(n, m))

≥ Ppc( ¯E4(n/8))Ppc (D1(n) ∩ D2(n) ∩ D3(n) ∩ N (Dn(n)) ∩ ¯G1(n) ∩ G2(n) ∩ G(n, m)).

(2.12)

Note that D1 and D2 ∩ D3 ∩ N (D2) ∩ ¯G1(n) occur in diﬀerent areas (see Fig. 1), so by (2.7) together with
the RSW lemma,

Ppc(D1(n) ∩ D2(n) ∩ D3(n) ∩ N (Dn(n)) ∩ ¯G1(n) ∩ G2(n) ∩ G(n, m))

≥ CPpc(D2(n) ∩ D3(n) ∩ N (Dn(n)) ∩ ¯G1(n) ∩ G2(n) ∩ G(n, m)).

By (2.9),

Ppc(D2(n) ∩ D3(n) ∩ N (Dn(n)) ∩ ¯G1(n) ∩ G2(n) ∩ G(n, m))

Ppc(N (Γ) | D2(n) = Γ)Ppc(D3(n) ∩ ¯G1(n) ∩ G2(n) ∩ G(n, m) ∩ {D2(n) = Γ})

(2.13)

(2.14)

where the sum takes over all possible edge sets Γ. By the FKG inequality, the RSW lemma, and (2.5),

Ppc(D3(n) ∩ ¯G1(n) ∩ G2(n) ∩ G(n, m) ∩ D2(n)) ≥ C3Ppc(G1(n) ∩ G(n, m)) ≥ C3Ppc(0 → ∂B(m)). (2.15)

If we put (2.11)–(2.15) together, then

Pν(Hǫ) ≥ C3 − δ.

(2.16)

Since δ can be arbitrarily small, the ﬁrst inequality in Lemma 2.3 follows.

Let us show the second inequities in Lemma 2.3. By using Lemma 2.11, we can show that

Pν(Hǫ(e), e is open/closed) = lim
m→∞

P −1

pc (0 → ∂B(m))Ppc (Hǫ(e), e is open/closed, 0 → ∂B(m)).

(2.17)

Note that the open path from the origin to ∂B(m) will not use e, so the conﬁguration of e is open or
closed independent of {Hǫ(e) ∩ 0 → ∂B(m)}. Thus, the second inequality in Lemma 2.3 follows from
(2.17). ✷

3 A martingale construction for Tn.

The martingale construction has been used to estimate the variance of an open cluster in super-critical
percolation (see Zhang 2001). As we know, super-critical percolation does not have two large open
clusters, so it can use the edge-to-edge martingale construction. However, there might be two large open
clusters at the criticality. Thus, we need a much more complicated martingale construction. We order
the edges of B(n) in the following way. First, we order the edges in B(1) in a certain order. For example,
we can do it by spiral order. Suppose that we order the edges in B(i); then we can order the edges
B(i + 1) \ B(i) in a certain order. Thus, we order all edges in B(n) by {e1, e2, · · · , ei, ei+1, · · · , em}. Our
probability space is Ω = {0, 1}m, where m is the number of edges in B(n) and, the generic point of Ω is
{ω1, · · · , ωm}. In conﬁguration ω, the state of ek is ω(ek) = ωk, where random variable ωk takes value
zero or one if the edge is open or closed. Note that Tn is deﬁned on the conﬁguration of open and closed
edges in [−n, n]2. If we change the open edge by zero and the closed edge by one, then we can deﬁne
Tn(ω) for ω ∈ Ω. In particular, if the edges in B(n) are divided into two sub-edge sets B1 ∪ B2, then we
can write ω = (ω(B1), ω(B2)) and Tn(ω) = Tn(ω(B1), ω(B2)).

k and v′′

For ek, recall that we considered its two vertices v′

k in the last section. We also let D∗(v′
k)
be the exterior boundary of the open cluster of v′ inside B(n) separating v′
k (see Fig. 2). We
call ek the pivotal in the connection of v′
k and the origin. Now we construct random sets for each ek. If
ek is a pivotal edge, then let Wk be the edge set enclosed by D(v′
k) ∪ ek, including the boundary edges.
We also call ek the pivotal edge of Wk. Note that ek can be open or closed. If ek is open or closed, we
denote in particular by W +
k for Wk. If ek is not a pivotal edge, we simply denote by Wk = ek.
Note that if both Wi and Wj are non-single edge sets, then the open clusters inside Wi and Wj cannot
have a common vertex. We call this the disjoint property. We start e1 to construct W1. Suppose that
{Wj1, · · · , Wjt} is deﬁned by following the edge order: {e1, · · · , em}. Suppose that these edges are

k or by W −

k from v′′

{ei1, ei1+1, · · · , ei1+l1, ei2, ei2+1, · · · , ei2+l2, · · · , eik , eik+1, · · · , eik+lk}

for ij + lj < ij+1. Then we consider ei1+l1+1 and the random set Wi1+l1+1. We add this random set
Wi1+l1+1 to have {Wj1, · · · , Wjt, Wjt+1}. If we continue this way by following the edges {e1, · · · , em}, we
will construct all edge sets in B(n). Without loss of generality, we still denote them by {W1, W2, · · · , Wm}
(see Fig. 2). Note that if Wk is not a single edge with the pivotal edge e, then D∗(v′) exists as the
exterior boundary of the open cluster, denoted by ¯D(v′) of v′(e). We say random set Wk satisﬁes the
bubble condition if it indeed consists of the edge set enclosed by D∗(v′
k) ∪ ek.
For given sets {V1, · · · , Vt}, we may consider the event {W1 = V1, · · · , Wt = Vt}.
It follows from our
construction that

k together with D(v′

k) ∪ e∗

{W1 = V1, · · · , Wt = Vt} and {W1 = V ′

1, · · · , Wt = V ′

t } are disjoint if Vj 6= V ′

j for some j ≤ t.

(3.1)

In other words, this construction is unique for each conﬁguration of open and closed edges in B(n). We
call this set structure the spiral bubble structure.

Note that Wk is a random set, so we use ω(Wk) to represent the conﬁguration of Ω such that each
open or closed edge in Wk is changed to be zero or one. Now we will construct the following martingale
sequence with these sets {W1, W2, · · · , Wm}. Let ﬁltration

F0 = the trivial σ-ﬁeld = {∅, Ω}.

Fk = the σ-ﬁeld generated by {ω(e) : e ∈ [i≤k

Wi} for 0 ≤ k ≤ m.

More precisely, Fk is the smallest σ-ﬁeld that contains all the sets with the form

{ω ∈ Ω : [i≤k

Wi = {ej1, ej2, · · · , ejt} for (ω(ej1), · · · , ω(ejt )) ∈ B},

where B is an i-dimensional Borel set. If k > m, we simply deﬁne that

Note that ∪i≤kWi ⊂ ∪i≤k+1Wi, so

Fk = Fm.

F0 ⊂ F1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Fk ⊂ · · · .

Thus, {F0, · · · , Fk, · · ·} is a ﬁltration constructed by random sets {W1, · · · , Wm}. With these σ-ﬁelds, the
martingale representation of Tn − EνTn is

(3.3)

Let us carefully analyze the martingale diﬀerence {∆k,n}. By our deﬁnition, Eν(Tn | Fk) is Fk
measurable. For a set Γk, let ω(Γk) and c(Γk) be a random conﬁguration set and a ﬁxed conﬁguration
set, respectively. Thus, we may regard Eν(Tn | Fk) as a random variable on random set ∪i≤kWi = Γk.
For a random conﬁguration ω(Γk) = ω(∪i≤kWi),

Eν(Tn | Fk) = Xc(Be(n)\Γk)

Tn(ω(Γk), c(Be(n) \ Γk))Pν (c(Be(n) \ Γk))

where Be is the edge set in [−n, n]2 and

Pν(c(Be(n) \ Γk)) = Pν(ω(Be(n) \ Γk) = c(Be(n) \ Γk)),

and the sum takes all conﬁgurations c(Be(n) \Si≤k Wi). By this deﬁnition, we show the following lemma.

Lemma 3.1. For any random set Γk = ∪i≤kWi constructed in the spiral bubble structure,

Xc(B(n)\Γk)

Pν (c(B(n) \ Γk)) = 1.

Proof. For Γk = ∪i≤kWi, let I(ω(Γk)) be the indicator for the conﬁguration of ω(Γk). Thus,

Note that I(ω(Γk)) is Fk-measurable, so if we suppose that

Eν(Eν (I(ω(Γk)) | Fk)) = EνI(ω(Γk)).

Xc(B(n)\Γk)

Pν (c(B(n) \ Γk)) < 1,

then

Eν(Eν (I(ω(Γk)) | Fk)) = EνI(ω(Γk)

 Xc(B(n)\Γk )

Pν (c(B(n) \ Γk))

 < Eν(I(ω(Γk)).

The contradiction of (3.6) and (3.7) shows that Lemma 3.1 holds. ✷

4.1 A lower bound estimate of the theorem.

For a given ǫ > 0, we may decompose Hǫ deﬁned in Lemma 2.3 into Hǫ(k, t) ⊂ Hǫ with the ﬁrst k, by
following the order e0, · · · , em, such that D∗(v′
k) with t vertices larger
than n2−5/4−ǫ, where v′

k) contains its open cluster ¯D∗(v′

k and v′′

k are the two vertices of ek. Thus,

Hǫ = [k [t

Hǫ(k, t).

By Lemma 2.3, note that {Hǫ(k, t)} are disjoint in t and k, so there exists C > 0 such that

Pν (Hǫ) = Xk Xt

Pν (Hǫ(k, t)) > C.

(4.1)

k), where {W1, · · · , Wm} is constructed in the spiral bubble structure and D∗(v′

Now we choose a conﬁguration with random set Γk = ∪i≤kWi in Hǫ(k, t) such that ek is open and
Wk = D∗(v′
k) contains
the open cluster ¯D∗(v′
k) with vertex size t larger than n2−5/48−ǫ. We denote by It(ω(Γk)) the indicator
of these conﬁgurations such that ek is open and the open cluster of v′ above has t vertices larger than
n2−5/48−ǫ. We also let I(Γk, Hǫ(k, t)) be the indicator such that on Hǫ(k, t) the ﬁrst k spiral bubble
random sets are Γk = ∪i≤kWi. Thus,

It(ω(Γk)) ≤ I(Γk, Hǫ(k, t)).

(4.2)

11

Indeed, if I(Γk, Hǫ(k, t)) = 1, ek may or may not be open, but ek is open when It(ω(Γk)) = 1. In other
words, if I(Γk, Hǫ(k, t)) = 1, Wk may be W +
