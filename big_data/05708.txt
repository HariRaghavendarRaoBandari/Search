In this paper, we show the existence of static and rotating universal horizons and black holes
in gravitational theories with the broken Lorentz invariance. We pay particular attention on the
ultraviolet regime, and show that universal horizons and black holes exist not only in low energy
scales but also in the UV scales. This is realized by presenting various static and stationary exact
solutions of the full theory of the projectable Hoˇrava gravity with an extra U(1) symmetry in
(2+1)-dimensions, which, by construction, is power-counting renormalizable.

INTRODUCTION

Lorentz invariance (LI) has been the cornerstone of
modern physics and strongly supported by observations
[1].
In fact, all the experiments carried out so far are
consistent with it, and no evidence to show that such a
symmetry needs to be broken at a certain energy scale,
although it is arguable that the constraints in the matter
sector are much stronger than those in the gravitational
sector [2].

Nevertheless, there are various reasons to construct
gravitational theories with broken LI. In particular, when
spacetimes are quantized, space and time emerge from
some discrete substratum, as what we currently under-
stand from the point of view of quantum gravity [3, 4],
then this symmetry becomes meaningless, so it must be
an emergent one at the low energy physics. Following this
line of thinking, various gravitational theories that vio-
late LI have been proposed, such as ghost condensation
[5], Einstein-aether theory [6], and more recently, Horava
theory of gravity [7]. While the ghost condensation and
Einstein-aether theory are all considered as the low en-
ergy eﬀective theories of gravity, the Horava gravity is
attempted to be ultraviolet (UV) complete [7]. In par-
ticular, in this theory the LI is broken in the UV, so the
theory can include higher-dimensional spatial derivative
operators. As a result, the UV behavior of the theory is
dramatically improved and can be made power-counting
renormalizable. On the other hand, the exclusion of high-
dimensional time derivative operators prevents the ghost
instability, whereby the unitarity problem of the theory

- a problem that has been faced since 1977 [8], is re-
solved.
In the infrared (IR) the lower dimensional op-
erators take over, whereby a healthy low-energy limit is
presumably resulted [9]. Recently, it was shown that the
Horava theory is not only power-counting renormalizable
but also perturbatively renormalizable [10]. In addition,
it is also very encouraging that the theory is canonically
quantizable in (1+1)-dimensional spacetimes with [11] or
without [12] the projectability condition.

However, once LI is broken diﬀerent species of particles
can travel with diﬀerent velocities, and in certain theo-
ries, including the Horava theory mentioned above, they
can be even arbitrarily large. This suggests that black
holes may exist only at low energies [13]. In high ener-
gies, any signal initially trapped inside a horizon many
be able to penetrate it and propagate to inﬁnity, as long
as the signal has suﬃciently large velocity (or energy).
This seems in a sharp conﬂict with current observations,
which already showed that rotating black holes exist in
our universe [14].

The above situation was dramatically changed in 2011
[15, 16], in which it was found that there still exist abso-
lute causal boundaries, the so-called universal horizons,
and particles even with inﬁnitely large velocities would
just move around on these boundaries and cannot es-
cape to inﬁnity. The main idea is as follows: In a given
space-time, a globally timelike scalar ﬁeld, the so-called
khronon [15], might exist. Then, similar to the Newto-
nian theory, this khronon ﬁeld deﬁnes globally an abso-
lute time, and all particles are assumed to move along
the increasing direction of the khronon, so the causality
is still well deﬁned [Cf. Fig. 1].
In such a spacetime,
there may exist a surface as shown in Fig. 2, denoted by
the vertical solid line. Given that all particles move along
the increasing direction of the khronon, from Fig. 2 it is
clear that particle must cross this surface and move in-
ward, once they arrive at it. This is a one-way membrane,
and particles even with inﬁnitely large speed cannot es-

2

time, depending on the space-time considered. Then, we
showed that the universal horizons indeed exist, by con-
structing concrete static charged solutions of the Horava
gravity. Taking the khronon ﬁeld as a test ﬁeld, we fur-
ther showed that in the three well-known black hole so-
lutions, the Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild anti-de Sitter,
and Reissner-Nordstr¨om, universal horizons exist and are
always inside the Killing horizons [19]. It should be note
that these solutions are often also solutions of gravita-
tional theories with the broken LI, such as the Horava
theory [20], and the Einstien-aether theory [6].

At the universal horizon, a slightly modiﬁed ﬁrst law
of black hole mechanics exists for the neutral Einstein-
aether black holes [21], but for the charged Einstein-
aether black holes, such a ﬁrst law is still absent [22].
Using the tunneling method, the Hawking radiation at
the universal horizon for a scalar ﬁeld that violates the
local LI was studied, and found that the universal horizon
radiates as a blackbody at a ﬁxed temperature [23]. An-
other diﬀerent approach was taken in [24], in which ray
trajectories in such black hole backgrounds were studied,
and evidence was found, which shows that Hawking radi-
ation is associated with the universal horizon, while the
“lingering” of low-energy ray trajectories near the Killing
horizon hints a reprocessing there. However, the study
of a collapsing null shell showed that the mode pasting
across the shell is adiabatic at late time [25]. This im-
plies that large black holes emit a thermal ﬂux with a
temperature ﬁxed by the surface gravity of the Killing
horizon. This, in turn, suggests that the universal hori-
zon should play no role in the thermodynamic proper-
ties of these black holes, although it should be noted
that in such a setting, the khronon ﬁeld is not continu-
ous across the collapsing null shell. As mentioned above,
a globally-deﬁned khronon seemingly plays an essential
role in the existence of a universal horizon, so it is not
clear how the results presented in [25] will be aﬀected
once the continuity of the khronon ﬁeld is imposed. On
the other hand, using the Hamilton-Jacobi method, re-
cently we studied quantum tunneling of both relativistic
and non-relativistic particles at Killing as well as univer-
sal horizons of Einstein-Maxwell-aether black holes, after
high-order curvature corrections are taken into account
[26]. Our results showed that only relativistic particles
are created at the Killing horizon, and the corresponding
radiation is thermal with a temperature exactly the same
as that found in general relativity. In contrary, only non-
relativistic particles are created at the universal horizon
and are radiated out to inﬁnity with a thermal spectrum.
However, diﬀerent species of particles in general experi-
ence diﬀerent temperatures.

In this paper, our main purposes are two-fold. First,
we shall show that universal horizons exist not only in
the low energy limit, but also in the UV regime. To
show this, we consider solutions of the full theory of
Horava gravity, that is, with all the high-order deriva-
tive terms. In general, this is highly mathematically in-
volved. To make the problem trackable, we restrict our-

surfaces, and the existence of the universal horizon in the
Schwarzschild spacetime [19], where φ denotes the khronon
ﬁeld, and t and r are the Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates.
Particles move always along the increasing direction of φ. The
Killing vector ζ µ = δµ
t always points upward at each point of
the plane. The vertical dashed line is the location of the
Killing horizon, r = rU H . The universal horizon, denoted by
the vertical solid line, is located at r = rU H , which is always
inside the Killing horizon.

cape from it, once they are trapped inside it. So, it acts
as an absolute horizon to all particles (with any speed),
which is often called the universal horizon [15, 16]. Since
then, this subject has already attracted some attentions
[17].

However, in most studies of universal horizons carried
out so far the khronon plays a part of the gravitational
theory involved [17]. To generalize the conception of the
universal horizons to any gravitational theory with bro-
ken LI, recently we considered the khronon as a test ﬁeld,
and assumed it to play the same role as a Killing vec-
tor, so its existence does not aﬀect the space-time con-
sidered, but deﬁnes the properties of it [18]. By this
way, such a ﬁeld is no longer part of the gravitational
theory and it may or may not exist in a given space-

the projectable Horava theory with an extra U(1) sym-
metry [27–30]. It should be noted that in [31] the eﬀects
of high-order derivative terms on the existence of univer-
sal horizons were studied, and found that, if a three-Ricci
curvature squared term is joined in the ultraviolet modiﬁ-
cation, the universal horizon appearing in the low energy
limit was turned into a spacelike singularity. While this
is possible, as the universal horizons might not be sta-
ble against nonlinear perturbations [15], the results pre-
sented in this paper show that they do exist even in the
UV regime. Second, we shall show that universal hori-
zons exist not only in static spacetime, but also in the
ones with rotation. This is important both theoretically
and observationally, as in our universe black holes are
normally rotating ones [14]. In [32], it was shown that
rotating universal horizons exist in the IR limit, in the
framework of the non-projectable Horava gravity with-
out the extra U(1) symmetry [33]. In this paper we shall
show that this is true not only in the IR limit but also in
the UV.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec-
tion II, we give a brief consideration of the stability of the
(2+1)-dimensional Horava theory with both projectabil-
ity condition and the extra U(1) symmetry, while a more
complete review of the theory in (d+1)-dimensions is pre-
sented in Appendix A. In section III, we present var-
ious static and stationary solutions by working in the
Painleve-Gullstrand (PG) coordinates [34]. The main
reason to work with these coordinates is that the solu-
tions are free of coordinate singularities across the Killing
horizons. However, a price to pay is that the ﬁeld equa-
tions mathematically become very much involved. For-
tunately, they still allow us to ﬁnd analytical solutions
in closed forms. In Section IV, we study the locations of
Killing and universal horizons, and ﬁnd that such hori-
zons are indeed exist, even the high-order terms of the
curvatures are included. The paper is ended in Section
V, in which we present our main conclusions. There are
also two more appendices, Appendix B and Appendix C,
in which some mathematical expressions are presented.
Before proceeding further, we would like to note that
the studies of black holes in gravitational theories with
the broken LI is also crucial in the understanding of
quantization of gravity [3, 4] and the non-relativistic
AdS/CFT correspondence [35–38]. But, such studies are
all in its infancy, and more detailed investigations are
highly demanded.

Then, the potential part of the action of the Horava the-

where Λ is the cosmological constant, and gn’s are di-
mensionless coupling constants, and ζ has the dimension
of (mass)−1. However, in 2d spaces the Ricci scalar R
always takes a complete derivative form. Then, when
N = N (t) the action can be integrated once and this
term will be expressed as a boundary term. So does the
g3∆R term. Therefore, in the case with the projectabil-
ity condition, without loss of generality, we can always
drop the g1 and g3 terms.

In Appendix A, we provide a brief introduction to the
(d+1)-dimensional Horava theory with the projectabil-
ity condition (A.4) and the Diﬀ(M, F) symmetry (A.5).
Setting d = 2 and taking the above potential (with
g1 = g3 = 0) into account, one can obtain the ﬁeld equa-
tions. In particular, the relativistic case is recovered by
setting

(λ, g2)GR = (1, 0).

(2.3)

In addition, one can show that the Minkowski space-time

(N, N i, gij, A, ϕ) = (1, 0, δij, 0, 0),

(2.4)

is a solution of the ﬁeld equations with Λ = Λg = 0.
Then, its linear perturbations can be cast in the form 1,

N = 1 + φ, Ni = ∂iB,
gij = (1 − 2ψ)δij + 2∂i∂jE,
A = δA, ϕ = δϕ,

(2.5)

where φ, B, ψ, E, δA and δϕ represent the scalar pertur-
bations, and the projectability condition requires φ =
φ(t). Using the gauge freedom, without loss of general-
ity, we can always set [39]

φ = E = δϕ = 0,

(2.6)

which uniquely ﬁx the gauge. Then, the quadratic action
without matter takes the form,

From Eq.(2.8) it can be seen that the scalar ψ satisﬁes the
Laplacian equation. Thus, it does not represent a prop-
agative mode, and with proper boundary conditions, one
can always set it to zero. Similarly, this is also true for
other scalars. Hence, the spin-0 gravitons are not present
in (2+1)-dimensions, similar to the (3+1)-dimensional
case [30].

III. STATIC AND STATIONARY VACUUM

SOLUTIONS

In this section we are going to study vacuum solu-
tions of the projectable Horava theory with the extra
U(1) symmetry introduced in the last section in (2+1)-
dimensional static and stationary spacetimes. Since our
main purpose is to study the existence of universal hori-
zons in such spacetimes, we shall choose the gauge so
that the solutions do not have coordinate singularities
outside of universal horizons. This is because universal
horizons are always located inside the Killing horizons 2.
In the spherically symmetric spacetimes with a time-like
foliation, this is quite similar to the PG coordinates [34].
Therefore, in this paper we shall refer such a coordinate
system as the PG coordinates. To proceed further, let us
ﬁrst consider static spacetimes.

A. Static Spacetimes

The general static solutions with the projectability

condition N = N (t) can be cast in the form,

in the spatial coordinates xi = (r, θ). Using the U(1)
symmetry, without loss of the generality, we choose the
gauge,

ϕ = 0,

(ϕ,n) = 0 = f ij

so that F ij
ϕ . Then, we ﬁnd that the
ij , Fij and Li are given
quantities Kij, Rij, πij, F A
by Eq.(B.1) in Appendix B. Then, Eqs.(A.17), (A.18),
(A.20), (A.21), (A.23), (A.28), and (A.29) reduce, re-
spectively, to Eqs.(B.2) - (B.8) given in Appendix B.

When the space-time is vacuum, Eqs.(B.3) - (B.7) re-

duce, respectively, to,

(3.7)

where a, b, c, d, P, Q, U, V and W are given by Eq.(B.9)
in Appendix B.

It should be noted that not all of the above equations
are independent. In fact, Eq.(3.4) can be obtained from
Eqs.(3.3) and (3.5), while Eq.(3.7) can be obtained from
Eqs.(3.6) and (3.5). Therefore, in the present case there
are three independent equations, (3.3), (3.5) and (3.6),
for the three unknowns, f, h and A. In particular, one
can ﬁrst ﬁnd f from Eq.(3.5),

f (r) = C1 − Λgr2,

(3.8)

where C1 is an integration constant. Substituting it into
Eq.(3.3), one can ﬁnd h(r). Once f and h are known,
from Eq.(3.6), we ﬁnd that

A0 −

(cid:90) r Q(r(cid:48))dr(cid:48)
(cid:113)

C1 − Λgr(cid:48)2

 , (3.9)

A(r) =

C1 − Λgr2

(cid:113)

where A0 is another integration constant. Therefore, our
main task now becomes to solve Eq.(3.3) for h with f
given by Eq.(3.8). Once h is known, the gauge ﬁeld A
can be obtained by quadrature from Eq.(3.9). To solve
Eq.(3.3), we consider the two cases Λg = 0 and Λg (cid:54)= 0,
separately.

1. Λg = 0

When Λg = 0, we have

2 In this paper we deﬁne a Killing horizon as the location at which
the time-translation Killing vector ζµ becomes null. In the space-
times with rotations, this coincides with the ergosurface (ergo-
sphere), while in the static spacetimes it coincides with the event
horizon [19, 40]

Therefore, we need to consider the two cases λ = 1 and
λ (cid:54)= 1, separately.

Case with λ = 1: Then, Eq.(3.11) is satisﬁed iden-
tically, and h is undetermined. This is similar to the

Inserting it, together with f given by Eq.(3.8),
into
Eq.(3.9), we can obtain A. However, because of the com-
plexity of h, it is found that no explicit expression for
A can be obtained, except for the case where h = 0 (or
C4 = C5 = 0), for which we ﬁnd that Q(r) and A(r) are
given exactly by Eqs.(3.17) and (3.18).
In addition, Eq.(3.20) holds only for C1 (cid:54)= 0. When

(3.14)

C1 = 0, Eq.(3.3) has the general solution,

h(r) = C+rδ+ + C−rδ− ,

When Λg (cid:54)= 0, it is also found convenient to study the

two cases, λ = 1 and λ (cid:54)= 1, separately.

Case with λ = 1: In this case, Eq.(3.3) yields

h(r) = 0.

Then, from Eqs.(B.9) and (3.8), we ﬁnd that

Inserting it into Eq.(3.9), we obtain

A(r) = A0

(3.18)
where A1 ≡ 2g2Λg/ζ 2 − Λ/Λg. It can be shown that this
is the static BTZ solution with mass M = −C1, provided
that A1 = −1. When A1 (cid:54)= −1, we provide the main
properties of the corresponding solution in Appendix C.
Case with λ (cid:54)= 1: In this case, Eq.(3.3) takes the

To obtain the general analytic solutions in this case, it is
found very diﬃcult, and instead let us ﬁrst consider the
case where Rij = 0 = Λg. Then, depending on the values
of λ, we ﬁnd two classes of solutions. The ﬁrst class is
for λ = 1, given by

where C1, ha, hb and A0 are all integration constants, and
similar to the static case the function hr(r) is arbitrary.

IV. UNIVERSAL HORIZONS AND BLACK
HOLES WITHOUT OR WITH ROTATIONS

As mentioned above, the fundamental variables of
the gravitational ﬁeld in the Horava theory with the
Diﬀ(M, F) symmetry (A.5) are

(N, N i, gij, A, ϕ).

In the framework of the universal coupling [42], they are
related to the spacetime line element ds2 via the rela-
tions,

where γijγik = δj

k, Ni ≡ γijN j, and

N ≡ (1 − a1σ) N, N i ≡ N i + N gij∇jϕ,
γij ≡ (1 − a2σ)2 gij, σ ≡ A − A
A ≡ − ˙ϕ + N i∇iϕ +

N(cid:0)∇iϕ(cid:1) (∇iϕ) .

(4.3)

Here a1 and a2 are two arbitrary coupling constants. The
solar system test in (3+1)-dimensions require that they
must satisfy the conditions (A.37).
In particular, for
(a1, a2) = (1, 0), the PPN parameters will be the same as
those given in general relavitiy [43]. Although in (2+1)-
dimensions, no such constraints exist, to be compara-
ble with those obtained in (3+1)-dimensions, we shall
impose these conditions also in the (2+1)-dimensional
spacetimes considered in this paper.
In particular, we
shall only consider the case with

a1 = 1, a2 = 0.

(4.4)

Therefore, with the gauge choice ϕ = 0, Eq.(4.3) reduces
to

N = N − A, N i = N i, γij = gij.

(4.5)

This is also consistent with the one adopted in [27] in
(3+1)-dimensions, when the solar system test was con-
sidered.

On the other hand, the critical point for a universal
horizon to be present is the existence of a globally deﬁned
khronon ﬁeld φ, which is always timelike [44]. Then, the
causality is assured by assuming that all the particles
move along the increasing direction of φ. In this sense, φ
serves as an absolute time introduced in the Newtonian
theory. Setting

uµ ≡ ∂µφ√
X

(4.6)
one can see that uµ is always timelike, γµνuµuν = −1,
where X ≡ −gαβ∂αφ∂βφ. In addition, such deﬁned uµ is
invariant under the gauge transformation,

,

φ = F( ˜φ),

(4.7)
provided that F( ˜φ) is a monotonically increasing (or de-
creasing) and otherwise arbitrary function of ˜φ. Such
deﬁned uµ also satisﬁes the hypersurface-orthogonal con-
dition,

u[νDαuβ] = 0,

(4.8)

where Dα denotes the covariant derivative with respect
to γµν.

In (2+1)-dimensional spacetimes, the most general

form of action of khronon is described as [45]

where γµν is given by Eq.(A.13), that is,

ds2 = γµνdxµdxν, (µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3)

where aµ ≡ uαDαuµ, and ci’s denote the coupling con-
stants of the khronon ﬁeld. However, due to the identity
(4.8), not all the four terms are independent.
In fact,
from Eq.(4.8) we ﬁnd that
∆Lφ ≡ aµaµ + (Dµuν) (Dµuν) − (Dνuµ) (Dµuν) = 0.

Then, we can always add this term into Sφ with arbitrary
coupling constant c0, so that the coupling constants ci in
Lφ can be redeﬁned as

c(cid:48)
1 = c1 + c0,
3 = c3 − c0,
c(cid:48)

c(cid:48)
2 = c2,
4 = c4 − c0.
c(cid:48)
Thus, one can always set one of the terms c(cid:48)
4 to
zero by properly choosing c0. In the following, we shall
leave this possibility open.

3 and c(cid:48)

1, c(cid:48)

(4.10)

Then, the variation of Sφ with respect to φ yields the

khronon equation [46],

From the above expressions, we ﬁnd

uµAµ = 0,

(cid:1) Dβuν.

(4.12)

(4.13)

that is, Aµ is always orthogonal to uµ.

Eq.(4.11) is a second-order diﬀerential equation for
uµ, and to uniquely determine it, two boundary condi-
tions are needed. These two conditions in stationary and
asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes can be chosen as follows
[19, 44]: (i) uµ is aligned asymptotically with the time
translation Killing vector ζ µ,

uµ ∝ ζ µ.

(4.14)

(ii) The khronon has a regular future sound horizon,
which is a null surface of the eﬀective metric [47],

µν = gµν −(cid:0)c2

φ − 1(cid:1) uµuν,

where cφ denotes the speed of the khronon given by,

φ =

(4.16)
where c123 ≡ c1 + c2 + c3, c14 ≡ c1 + c4. It is interesting
to note that such a speed does not depend on the redeﬁ-
nition of the new parameters c(cid:48)
i given by Eq.(4.10), as it
is expected.

The universal horizon is the location at which uµ and

7

Since uµ is always timelike, and ζ µ is also timelike outside
theKilling horizon, Eq.(4.17) is possible only inside the
Killing horizon, in which ζ µ becomes spacelike. With
all the above in mind, now we are ready to consider the
locations of universal horizons in the solutions found in
the last section for static or stationary spacetimes.

A. Universal Horizons and Black Holes in Static

Spacetimes

In the static spacetimes of the solutions found in the

last section, the general form of metric is

ds2 = −N 2dt2 +

1

f (r)

[dr + h(r)dt]2 + r2dθ2,

(4.18)

as can be seen from Eqs.(3.1) and (4.5). Following [44],
it can be shown that Eq.(4.11) is equal to

Aµ = 0,

(4.19)

in asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes, in which we have

V → 0, N → 1, F → 1, ut → 1,
X → 1, h → 0,

(4.20)
as r → ∞. In the following we shall assume that this is
also true to other spacetimes. To simplify Eqs.(4.19), in
the following we only consider the case

c14 = 0,

(4.21)

for which the speed cφ of the khronon ﬁeld becomes in-
ﬁnitely large, as one can see form Eq.(4.16). In this case,
the sound horizon of the khronon coincides with the uni-
versal horizon, and the requirement that the khronon has
a regular future sound horizon reduces to that of the uni-
versal horizon.

It can be shown that Eq.(4.19) has only one indepen-
(cid:18)N (cid:48)
dent component, and with the assumption (4.21), it re-
duces to
N − f(cid:48)

On the other hand, the scalar and extrinsic curvatures

R and K are given by,

(4.31)

(4.32)

assume that G(r) ≥ 0 for any r ∈ (0,∞). Then, one can
see that the location of the universal horizon must be the
minimum of the function G(r), so that at r = rU H , we
must have [19],

G(r)|r=rUH = 0 = G(cid:48)(r)|r=rUH .

(4.25)

On the other hand, at the Killing horizon r = rKH we

have ζ µζµ = 0, or equivalently K (rKH ) = 0, where

K(r) ≡ N (r)2 − h(r)2
f (r)

.

(4.26)

Then, γµν and γµν are given by,

Therefore, in order for the metric to be free from coor-
dinate singularities across the Killing horizon, we must
require that both h (rKH ) and f (rKH ) are ﬁnite and non-
zero. In the (3+1)-dimensional case, we know that the
Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-de Sitter solutions sat-
isfy these conditions, but not for the Schwarzschild-anti-
de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstr¨om solutions [19]. For the
latter, one needs ﬁrst to make extensions across those
horizons, and then study the existence of universal hori-
zons inside of those Killing horizons.
In the following,
we shall show that even with such strong conditions so-
lutions that harbor universal horizons still exist.

1. Λg = 0, λ = 1

In this case the solutions are given by Eqs.(3.10) and
In order
(3.13) with h(r) being an arbitrary function.
to have the metric regular across the Killing horizon, we
assume that h(r) (cid:54)= 0, for which the metric takes the
form,

the ﬁnal form,

D(r)

D(r) ≡ H 2 − (Λr2 − 2 ¯A0)r2β.

Clearly, to avoid spacetime singularities occurring at ﬁ-
nite and non-zero r, we must assume that D(r) (cid:54)= 0 for
r ∈ (0,∞).

When Λ = 0, we have D(r) = H 2 +2 ¯A0r2β. Therefore,
for A0 > 0, we always have D(r) > 0. In this case, if we
further set H = 2 and β = 1/2, we ﬁnd that Eq.(4.31)
has the asymptotic solution,

V |r→∞ → u0
r

,

(4.33)
which satisﬁes the boundary condition uµ ∝ ξµ at inﬁn-
ity. But, an analytical solution of Eq.(4.31) for any r is
still absent even in this simple case. The corresponding
metric takes the form,

(4.34)

Since even in this simple case, analytically solving
Eq.(4.31) is not trivial, instead in the following we shall
use the shooting method ﬁrst to solve it, and then lo-
calize the positions of the Killing and universal horizons,
which satisﬁes, respectively, the equation K(rKH ) = 0,
and (4.25), where K(r) is given by Eq.(4.26).

In Fig.3, we show the curves of G(z), V (z) and K(z)
for various choices of the parameter cp ≡ c13/c123, and
ﬁnd the locations of the Killing and universal horizons,
denoted, respectively, by rKH and rU H , where z ≡ 1/r.
From this ﬁgure one can see that the locations of the
universal horizons depend on cp as it is expected.
When Λ (cid:54)= 0, the mathematics becomes more involved.
In the following we shall consider some representative
choices of the parameter β.
Case 1.a β = −1: In the case, to have D(r) (cid:54)= 0 for
Λ−H 2 ≤ 0. In Fig. 4, we
r ∈ (0,∞), we assume that
show the functions G, V and K and the locations of the
Killing and universal horizons for various choices of cp.
Case 1.b β < −1: In the case, to have D(r) (cid:54)= 0
for r ∈ (0,∞), we must assume that either ¯A0 ≥ 0 and
Λ < 0, or ¯A0 ≥ 0, Λ > 0. Then, in Fig. 5 we show the
functions G, V and K and the locations of the Killing and
universal horizons for various choices of cp with β = −2.
Case 1.c 0 > β > −1: In this case, we ﬁnd that we
must assume that either ¯A0 > 0, Λ < 0, or ¯A0 > 0, Λ >
0, in order not to have spacetime singularities at a ﬁnite
and non-zero r. In Fig.6, we show the functions G, V and
K and the locations of the Killing and universal horizons
for various choices of cp with β = −1/2.

¯A0

Case 1.d β = 0: In the case, we must assume that
≤ 0, and in Fig.7 we show the functions G, V and
2 ¯A0+H 2
K and the locations of the Killing and universal horizons.
Case 1.e β > 0: In this case, we require that Λ < 0.
Then, in Fig.8 we show the functions G, V and K and the
locations of the Killing and universal horizons for β = 2.

In this case, the solutions are given by Eqs.(3.10),
(3.14) and (3.15). Similar to the last case, without loss of
the generality, we can always set C1 = 1, and the metric
takes the form,

To study these solutions further, let us consider the cases
C3 = 0 and C3 (cid:54)= 0, separately.
When C3 = 0, we assume that C2 (cid:54)= 0. Otherwise, the
metric will be singular across the Killing horizons. Then,
the rescaling,

t → C−1

2 t, A0 → C2A0, Λ → C2Λ,

(4.36)

leads the metric to the form,

ds2 = −(cid:0)A0 − Λr2(cid:1)2

Thus, to avoid spacetime singularity at A0 − Λr2 = 0, we
shall assume A0Λ ≤ 0. On the other hand, the Killing
horizon is located at,

(A0 − Λr2

KH )2 − r2

(4.39)
which has real and positive roots only when 1+4A0Λ ≥ 0.
Moreover, in the present case Eq.(4.22) reduces to

When C3 (cid:54)= 0, the rescaling of the timelike coordinate

and the redeﬁnitions of the parameters,

lead the metric to the form,

Λg (cid:54)= 0

When Λg (cid:54)= 0, the solutions are mathematically much
involved, and in this subsection we only consider the case
where λ (cid:54)= 1 but C1 = 0. Then, the solutions are given by
Eqs.(3.8), (3.22)-(3.25), for which the extrinsic curvature
is given by

(4.45)

to have the metric real, as noticed in the last section, we
must have either λ ≤ 1 or λ ≥ 5. When λ ≤ 1, λ should
be larger than − 1

inﬁnity.

In Fig. 12, we show the functions K, V and G, and
numerically ﬁnd the radii of the Killing and universal
horizons for λ ≤ 1.
A similar consideration is presented in Fig. 13 for λ ≥
5. In particular, in this ﬁgure we have chosen λ = 19
3 ,
Λ2 = 1, Λg = −1, A0 = −2, C− = 2 and C+ = 1.

In all the cases considered above, a universal horizon
always exists inside a Killing horizon. To assure that no
coordinate singularities appear across the Killing hori-
zons, we are forced to use the PG-like coordinates, in
which N i does not vanishes identically. Although not all
of the solutions of the theory can be written in this form,
as we mentioned above, the solutions considered in this
paper indeed all possess these properties.

It is also important to note that the solutions pre-
sented above are the solutions of the full theory, that
is, including the contribution of the high-order derivative
term speciﬁed by the coeﬃcient g2. Therefore, our above
results show that universal horizons and black holes exist
not only in the infrared limit, but also in the ultraviolet
limit.

B. Universal Horizons and Black Holes in

Rotating Spacetimes

When spacetimes have rotations, the Killing horizons
are diﬀerent from event horizons. The former are often
called ergosurfaces (or ergospheres when its topology is
Sn, where n denotes the dimensions of the horizon), while
the latter is deﬁned by the existence of a null surface of
the normal vector, rµ ≡ ∂µr [40], that is,
= γrr (re) = 0.

γµνrµrν|r=re

(4.48)

In the following, we shall continuously denote the loca-
tions of the Killing horizons (or ergosurfaces) by rKH ,
while the locations of the event horizons by re.

In the rotating spacetimes described by Eqs.(3.26),
(3.27), (3.29) and (3.30), it is reasonable to assume that
the khronon ﬁeld φ depends only on t and r, as all the
metric coeﬃcients are independent of θ. Then, we ﬁnd
that uµ (∝ φ,µ) must take the form uµ = (ut(r), ur(r), 0),
where ut = ut (ur), as now we have γµνuµuν = −1. Note

that all of the three components uµ =(cid:0)ut, ur, uθ(cid:1) in gen-

(4.47)

eral do not vanish, due to the rotation, although both

Clearly, G < 0 as r → ∞, which is not allowed by the

3. Rij (cid:54)= 0

In this case, the solutions are given by Eqs.(3.29) and
(3.30), and the corresponding spacetimes with ai = (1, 0)
describes a spacetime, but the metric at the killing hori-
zon located at f (rKH ) = 0 becomes singular. Therefore,
to study the location of the universal horizon inside it, an
extension of the solution into the internal of the Killing
horizon is needed. Such extension is standard [32], so in
the following we shall not consider it further.

V. CONCLUSION

14

In this paper, we have studied the existence of univer-
sal horizons and black holes in gravitational theories with
the broken Lorentz invariance. We have paid particular
attention in the case where the gravitational ﬁeld is so
strong that the infrared limit does not exist, and higher-
order derivative terms must be included, in order for the
theory to be UV complete. We have shown that even in
the UV regime both static and rotating universal hori-
zons and black holes exist. Therefore, universal horizons
and black holes are not only the low energy phenomena
but also phenomena existing in the UV regime. To reach
this conclusion, we have ﬁrst constructed exact solutions
of the full theory of Horava gravity with the projectability
and U(1) symmetry in (2+1)-dimensions, which is power-
counting renormalizable [27–30]. To avoid coordinate sin-
gularities across the Killing horizons, we have chosen to
work with the PG-like coordinates [34]. Although this
normally makes the ﬁeld equations very complicated, we
are still fortunate enough to be able to ﬁnd analytical so-
lutions in both static and stationary spacetimes. Then,
we have numerically solved the khronon ﬁeld equations,
and identiﬁed the locations of the universal horizons. In
all the cases considered, universal horizons always exist,
and locate inside Killing horizons.

With these exact solutions, we hope that the studies of
thermodynamics of black holes at the universal horizons,
specially the ones with rotations, can be made more ac-
cessible. We also hope that they will help us to get more
deep insights into the problem of quantization of the the-
ory [3, 4], and the non-relativistic AdS/CFT correspon-
dence [35–38]. The studies of these important issues are
out of scope of this paper, and we wish to come back to
them in other occasions.

Finally, we would like to note that our main conclu-
sion regarding to the existence of universal horizons and
black holes in all energy scales (including the UV regime)
should be easily generalized to other versions of Horava
gravity [9, 13], although in this paper we have consid-
ered it only in the projectable Horava theory with an
extra U(1) symmetry [27–30].

Appendix A. Projectable Horava theory with U(1)

symmetry in (d+1) dimensions

In this Appendix, we give a brief introduction to the
projectable Horava theory with U(1) symmetry. for de-
tail, we refer readers to [27–30].

A. The Gauge Symmetries

The Horava theory is based on the perspective that
Lorentz symmetry should appear as an emergent symme-
try at long distances, but can be fundamentally absent at
short ones [48]. In the latter regime, the system exhibits
a strong anisotropic scaling between space and time,

x → (cid:96)x,

t → (cid:96)zt,

(A.1)
where z ≥ 3 in the (3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime [7, 49].
At long distances, high-order curvature corrections be-
come negligible, and the lowest order terms R and Λ
take over, whereby the Lorentz invariance is expected
to be “accidentally restored,” where R denotes the 3-
dimensional Ricci scalar, and Λ the cosmological con-
stant. Because of the anisotropic scaling, the gauge
symmetry of the theory is broken down to the foliation-
preserving diﬀeomorphism, Diﬀ(M, F),

˜t = t − f (t),

˜xi = xi − ζ i(t, x),

(A.2)

˙ζ k + ˙Nif + Ni

for which the lapse function N , shift vector N i, and 3-
spatial metric gij transform as
δN = ζ k∇kN + ˙N f + N ˙f ,
δNi = Nk∇iζ k + ζ k∇kNi + gik
δgij = ∇iζj + ∇jζi + f ˙gij,

(cid:0)t, xk(cid:1) −
(cid:0)t, xk(cid:1), etc. From these expressions one can see that

˙f ,
(A.3)
where ˙f ≡ df /dt, ∇i denotes the covariant derivative
with respect to gij, Ni = gikN k, and δgij ≡ γij
gij
N and N i play the role of gauge ﬁelds of the Diﬀ(M, F).
Therefore, it is natural to assume that N and N i inherit
the same dependence on space and time as the corre-
sponding generators [7],

N = N (t), N i = N i(t, x),

(A.4)

which is often referred to as the projectability condition.
Due to the Diﬀ(M, F) diﬀeomorphisms (A.2), one
more degree of freedom appears in the gravitational sec-
tor - a spin-0 graviton. This is potentially dangerous, and
needs to decouple in the IR regime, in order to be consis-
tent with observations. A very promising approach along
this direction is to eliminate the spin-0 graviton by intro-
ducing two auxiliary ﬁelds, the U (1) gauge ﬁeld A and the

16
Newtonian prepotentail ϕ, by extending the Diﬀ(M, F)
symmetry (A.2) to include a local U (1) symmetry [27],

U (1) (cid:110) Diﬀ(M, F).

(A.5)

Under this extended symmetry, the special status of time
maintains, so that the anisotropic scaling (A.1) can still
be realized, and the theory is UV complete. Meanwhile,
because of the elimination of the spin-0 graviton,
its
IR behavior can be signiﬁcantly improved. Under the
Diﬀ(M, F), A and ϕ transform as,

δA = ζ i∂iA + ˙f A + f ˙A,
δϕ = f ˙ϕ + ζ i∂iϕ.

(A.6)

Under the local U (1) symmetry, the ﬁelds transform as

δαA = ˙α − N i∇iα,
δαNi = N∇iα,

δαϕ = −α,

δαgij = 0,

δαN = 0,

(A.7)

where α is the generator of the local U (1) gauge symme-
try. For the detail, we refer readers to [27, 28].

The elimination of the spin-0 graviton was done ini-
tially in the case λ = 1 [27, 28], but soon generalized
to the case with any λ [29, 30, 50], where λ denotes a
coupling constant that characterizes the deviation of the
kinetic part of action from the corresponding one given
in GR with λGR = 1. For the analysis of Hamiltonian
consistency, see [27, 51].

given in [30] because here we took N i as the fundamental variable
instead of Ni as what we did in [30]. The subtle is that Ni now
are functions of gij via the relations Ni = gij N j , once N i are
considered as the fundamental variables, or vice versa. Of course,
they are equivalent, if one consistently uses either N i or Ni to
carry out the derivation of all the ﬁeld equations.

Note that the solar system tests (with d = 3) lead to

the constraints [42],

|a1 − 1| < 10−5,

|a2| < 10−5.

(A.37)

In particular, for

(a1, a2) = (1, 0),

(A.38)

the corresponding parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN)
parameters can take the same values as those given in
GR.
