Abstract

We propose a simple and new uniﬁed method to achieve lag, complete and
anticipatory synchronizations in coupled nonlinear systems. It can be consid-
ered as an alternative to the subsystem and intentional parameter mismatch
methods. This novel method is illustrated in a unidirectionally coupled RC
phase shift network based Chua’s circuit. Employing feedback coupling, dif-
ferent types of chaos synchronization are observed experimentally and nu-
merically in coupled identical chaotic oscillators without using time delay.
With a simple switch in the experimental set up we observe diﬀerent kinds
of synchronization. We also analyze the coupled system with numerical sim-
ulations.

1. Introduction

Synchronization is a fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon, ﬁrst dis-
covered in coupled pendula by Huygens [1]. Chaos synchronization properties
of uni- and bidirectionally coupled chaotic systems have attracted the atten-
tion of many researchers due to their potential applications in a variety of
ﬁelds [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Diﬀerent synchronization states have
been studied in the literature, including complete or identical synchronization
(CS) [2, 4, 13], in-phase synchronization(PS) [14, 15, 16], antiphase synchro-
nization (APS) [17, 18, 19], lag synchronization (LS) [8, 18], anticipatory syn-
chronization (AS) [18, 20, 21, 22], and generalized synchronization (GS) [23].
In the case of lag synchronization [8, 18] the response system trails behind
the drive system, while during anticipatory synchronization [18, 20, 21, 22]
the response system leads the drive system in time. Such time-shifted syn-
chronizations have been observed in lasers [24], neuronal models [25], and
electronic circuits [18] and oﬀer intriguing possibilities for possible techno-
logical applications [3, 26, 27, 28, 29].

Using an explicit time delay or a memory unit, both lag and anticipa-
tory synchronizations in unidirectionally coupled oscillators can be observed.
Lag synchronization can be obtained by coupling the response system to a
past state of the drive, whereas anticipatory synchronization can be obtained
through a feedback mechanism where the current state of the drive system
is coupled to the past state of the response system [25]. In either case, an
explicit time delay appears in the coupling.

An approximate lag synchronization in mutually coupled chaotic oscilla-
tor can be observed by having a parameter mismatch [30, 31, 32]. In particu-
lar, intermittent and continuous lag synchronizations have been observed as
intermittent steps in a route from phase to complete synchronization as the
coupling strength is increased [25]. In general, both lag and anticipatory syn-
chronizations in unidirectionally coupled chaotic oscillators can be achieved
using a speciﬁc intentional parameter mismatch between the drive and re-
sponse systems [30]. This type of lag and anticipatory synchronizations has
important technological implications in engineered systems.

In this paper we propose an alternative approach to the subsystem ap-
proach and the intentional parameter mismatch method and achieve diﬀer-
ent types of synchronization in a network of unidirectionally coupled identical
Chua’s circuit. Chua’s circuit and its variance are well known chaotic circuits
which exhibit a wide variety of nonlinear dynamical phenomena such as bifur-

2

cations and chaos [4, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. Recently, three of the present authors
along with others have constructed a new phase shift network based Chua’s
circuit [38], which exhibits period-doubling bifurcation route to chaotic at-
tractor.
In this manuscript, we study the occurrence of diﬀerent types of
chaos synchronization in unidirectionally coupled system of two identical RC
phase shift network based Chua’s circuits [38]. We ﬁrst demonstrate exper-
imentally and then verify them by numerical methods (which is needed to
conﬁrm the similarity functions as explained in the text) and obtain lag,
complete and anticipatory synchronizations. The method involves switching
the connection in the drive and response circuits which in turn produces the
above types of synchronization. In short, this mechanism is a very simple
and elegant way of achieving lag, complete and anticipatory synchronizations
in unidirectionally coupled chaotic oscillators.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec. 2, the circuit realiza-
tion of RC phase shift network based Chua’s circuit is discussed. The nature
of synchronizations of this coupled Chua’s circuit is studied both experimen-
tally and numerically for diﬀerent coupling conﬁgurations. We summarize
the results in Sec. 3.

2. Coupled RC phase shift network based Chua’s circuit

In the following we study the dynamics of a system of two coupled identi-
cal RC phase shift network based modiﬁed Chua’s circuits which is shown in
Fig. 1. In this circuit, v1, v2, v3, vLC and iL are the voltages across the capac-
itors C1, C2, C3 and CL and the current through the inductor L, respectively.
The drive system is connected to the response system through a buﬀer and a
coupling resistance (Rc). The buﬀer allows the current to ﬂow from drive to
response circuit only. Using the unidirectional feedback coupling approach,
we demonstrate three types of chaos synchronization, namely complete, lag
and anticipatory synchronizations in the proposed modiﬁed coupled Chua’s
circuit both experimentally and numerically without the introduction of any
time-delay or parameter mismatch. We also note that the motivation for car-
rying out numerical studies here is also to conﬁrm the nature of the similarity
functions in the following. By simply connecting (switching) the response
system and the drive system through any of the three terminals 1, 2 and 3 of
the drive and response systems (shown in Fig. 1), we observe the three types
of synchronization. The reason for introducing diﬀerent couplings of state
variables v1 , v2 and v3 is to observe all the three types of synchronizations,

namely lag, identical and anticipatory synchronizations, in a simple manner.
This is achieved by exploiting the ﬁnite phase-shift that is being introduced
by the individual RC network elements. We use the notation (m, n) to denote
that the mth terminal of the drive system is connected to the nth terminal
of the response system. The details are as follows.

2.1. Drive system connected to the terminal 2 of the response system

In this subsection we study the dynamics of the coupled RC phase shift
network based Chua’s circuit (Fig. 1) when various terminals of the drive
system are connected to the terminal 2 of the response system one by one.
First we study the dynamics of the circuit when the terminal 2 of the drive
systeme is connected to the terminal 2 of the response system, compactly
represented as (2,2). In this conﬁguration, the drive system variable v2 is
connected to the response system variable v(cid:48)
2 through a buﬀer and coupling
resistor Rc. This is obviously the case of two identical systems connected
by an error feedback coupling. The state equation of this coupled circuit is
obtained (Fig. 1) using Kirchoﬀ’s laws. The governing circuit equation is
given by

Note that the drive system drives the response by the drive component

the following. In the connection conﬁguration (2, 2) (see Fig. 1) we observe
complete synchronization for  = 1.3. The corresponding experimental time
series of the drive and response variables (v2 & v(cid:48)
2) are shown in Fig. 2(a)
and the corresponding numerical plot is shown in Fig. 3(a). In Fig. 2 the
horizontal axis is calibrated as 400 µs/div. and the vertical axis is 2 v/div.
From these ﬁgures, it is clear that both the phase and amplitude of the drive
and response systems are the same, implying that the coupled systems of

Fig. 1 exhibit complete synchronization. The same is observed in the phase
space plots as shown in Fig. 4(a). The degree of anticipatory synchronization
with the corresponding time shift τ can be quantiﬁed using the similarity
function [8] deﬁned as

S2(τ ) =

(cid:104)[y(cid:48)(t − τ ) − y(t)]2(cid:105)
[(cid:104)y2(t)(cid:105)(cid:104)y(cid:48)2(t)(cid:105)]1/2 ,

(7)

where (cid:104)y(cid:105) is the time average of y. In the case of lag synchronization the
numerator of the above expression for the similarity function has to modiﬁed
as (cid:104)[y(cid:48)(t + τ ) − y(t)]2(cid:105). So that τ is positive for both anticipatory and lag
synchronizations as per convention [39].
(t) are
independent, the diﬀerence between them is of the same order as the signals
themselves. If y(t) = y
(t), as in the case of complete synchronization, the
similarity function reaches a minimum, S2(τ ) = 0, for τ = 0. Figure 5(a)
shows the similarity function S2(τ ) as a function of the time shift τ between
the drive and response systems. One may note that the minimum of S2(τ ) ≈
0.00002 occurs at τ ≈ 0.0 for  = 1.3. This indicates that there exists no time
shift between the two signals in Fig. 3(a) such that y(cid:48)(t) = y(t) demonstrating

while the other equations in (2) and (5) remain the same. For  = 1.3 the
coupled oscillators exhibit anticipatory synchronization. Figures 2(b) and
3(b) depict the experimental and numerical time series plot of y and y(cid:48),
respectively. From these ﬁgures we can observe that y(cid:48) anticipates y.
In
other words, the response system anticipates the drive system, thereby we
can infer the anticipatory synchronization of the system shown in Fig. 1.
The corresponding phase space plot is shown in Fig. 4(b). We can again use
the similarity function S2(τ ) to characterize anticipatory synchronization.
For the case of a nonzero value of time shift τ , if S2(τ ) ≈ 0, there exists a
(t− τ ) = y(t),
time shift τ between the two signals y(t) and y
demonstrating anticipatory synchronization. Figure 5(b) shows the similarity
function S2(τ ) as a function of the time shift τ . One may note that the
minimum of S2(τ ) ≈ 0.328 (see Fig. 5(b)) occurs at τ ≈ 0.24 for  = 1.3.
This indicates that the response system leads the drive system by a time
shift τ ≈ 0.24 time units. However, we note that S2(τ ) is not close to zero,
and this is because the amplitude of oscillations of the response and drive
systems are mismatched. By suitably choosing an ampliﬁcation factor, one
can match the amplitudes of both the systems and make S2(τ ) ≈ 0. For
example by an ampliﬁcation of the response signal y(cid:48) by a factor 1.73, we
ﬁnd the similarity function S2(τ ) ≈ 0 for the time shift τ = 0.24 (see Figure

For  = 1.3 and the z-drive component coupled through one way coupling to
the response subsystem, the coupled oscillators exhibit lag synchronization.
Experimental and numerical plots of time series of v2 and v(cid:48)
2 or y and y(cid:48) are
shown in Figs. 2(c) and 3(c), respectively. In this case, the response system
variable y(cid:48) lags the drive system variable y. In other words the circuit (Fig. 1)
exhibits lag synchronization. The phase space plots for lag synchronizations
is shown in Fig. 4(c). The similarity function S2(τ ) characterizes the lag
synchronization with a positive time shift τ instead of the negative time shift
τ in Eq. (7). The curve in Fig. 5(c) shows the similarity function S2(τ ) vs
τ . The minimum of similarity function becomes S2(τ ) ≈ 0.13 at τ ≈ 0.07
indicating that there is a time shift [Fig. 3(c)] between the drive and response
(t + τ ) ≈ y(t), conﬁrming the occurrence
signals y(t) and y
of lag synchronization. The minimum of S2(τ ) ≈ 0.13 corresponds to a lag
synchronization with lag time τ ≈ 0.07 between y(t) and y
(t) in Fig. 3(c).
Note here that the minimum of S2(τ ) is again not close to zero because of the
mismatch in the amplitude of the drive and response signals (even though
the phases are matched). With suitable ampliﬁcation of the response signal
(by a factor 0.7, see in Figs. 2(c(cid:48)) and 3(c(cid:48))), we ﬁnd the minimum of S2(τ )
to be approximately zero, which is shown in Fig. 5(c’).

We wish to note here that the lag/anticipatory synchronization exhibited
by the system is only an average lag/average anticipatory synchronization
and it is because the output of the RC network depends on the frequency of
the input signal. We have used 20,000 data points with a step size of 0.01
for calculating all the similarity function after leaving a transient of 1,50,000
data points. We wish to emphasize that the value of τ calculated using the
similarity function is only an average value and we have used a fairly large set
of data points in calculating it. We have also tried using a larger data points
in calculating similarity function but it is found that it does not aﬀect the
value of τ . We also wish to point out that the amplitude diﬀerence between
the drive and response signal is also approximately a constant because the
output signal of RC network depends on the frequency of the input signal.
Therefore even after suitable ampliﬁcation of the response signal, there will
be a slight mismatch in the amplitude with the drive signal.

2.2. Drive system connected to the terminal 1 of response system

In this section, we study the dynamics of the two coupled circuits (Fig. 1)
when the terminal 1 of the response system is connected to one of the three

where V is any one of the drive signals v1, v2 and v3 and X is either x, y or
z.

As in the previous subsection we ﬁrst study the dynamics of the coupled
system when terminal 1 of the response system is connected to the terminal
1 of the drive system. In other words, when the response circuit voltage v(cid:48)
1 is

15

connected with the drive circuit voltage v1 through a coupling resistor Rc, we
observe complete synchronization. Time series of the drive (v2) and response
(v(cid:48)
2) voltage signals are shown in Fig. 6(a) and the corresponding numerical
plot is shown in Fig. 7(a). The same is also observed in the phase space
plots, shown in Fig. 9(a).

Next we study the coupling conﬁguation (2,1). For this conﬁguration
we ﬁnd that the drive and the response systems are in lag synchronization
for  = 1.3. Figures 6(b) and 7(b) depict the time series plot of y and
y(cid:48) numerically and experimentally. From these ﬁgures we observe that y(cid:48)
lags with y. The corresponding phase space plots are shown in Fig. 9(b).
Figure 8(a) shows the similarity function conﬁrming lag synchronization.

Finally we study the system for the coupling conﬁguration (3, 1). This
coupled circuit exhibits lag synchronization again. The time series plots
(experimental and numerical) showing the presence of lag synchronization
are given in Figs. 6(c) and 7(c), respectively. The phase plane plots are
shown in Fig. 9(c). The lag synchronization is conﬁrmed by the minimum of
the similarity function (Fig. 8(b)) and the amount of lag in the (3, 1) coupling
conﬁguration is found to be higher than the lag in (2, 1) conﬁguration. From
Figs. 8(a,b) we ﬁnd that the similarity function S2(τ ) is minimum at τ =
0.21 for (2, 1) coupling and S2(τ ) is minimum at τ = 0.27 for the coupling
conﬁguration (3, 1). Again we ﬁnd that the minimum values of the similarity
function S2(τ ) for both the conﬁgurations (2,1) and (3,1) are not close to zero
and the reason for this is the amplitude mismatch explained in Section 2.1.
With suitable ampliﬁcation to the response system the minimum of S2(τ )
becomes quite close to zero in each of the cases.

2.3. Drive system connected to the terminal 3 of the response system

In this subsection, we study the nature of synchronization in the coupled
circuits (Fig. 1) in the conﬁguration (m, 3), m = 1, 2, 3. In this conﬁguration,
the response system equations, Eqs. (2c) and (5c), get modiﬁed as

and

(16)

where V denotes any one of the drive signals v1, v2 and v3 and Z denotes
any one of the scaled variables x, y and z. For this coupling conﬁguration
the coupling terms in equations (2b) and (5b) are removed.

16

Let us ﬁrst consider the coupling conﬁguration (1, 3). This coupling con-
ﬁguration exhibits anticipatory synchronization. The time series plots of
drive and response system are shown in Figs. 10(a)(experimental) and 11(a)
(numerical), respectively. Figure 13 depicts the corresponding phase plane
plots of the drive and response systems. These ﬁgures clearly indicate the
anticipatory synchronization exhibited by the coupled circuits. Again the
synchronization is characterized using similarity function which is plotted in
Fig. 12(a). The minimum of the similarity function is found at τ = 0.32.

Changing the coupling conﬁguration to (2, 3) also results in anticipatory
synchronization. The time series plots obtained experimentally and numer-
ically are shown in Figs. 10(b) and 11(b) respectively. The corresponding
similarity function given in Fig. 12(b) clearly shows the anticipatory synchro-
nization of the coupled system (S2(τ ) minimum at τ = 0.07)]. As mentioned
in the previous cases, with suitable ampliﬁcation to the response signal one
can make the minimum of S2(τ ) close to zero. From the similarity function
plot we ﬁnd that the amount of lead in the conﬁguration (2, 3) is lower than
the lead in the (1, 3) conﬁguration. Figure 13(b) depicts the corresponding
phase plane plots of drive and response systems.

Finally, we connect the drive and response systems in the conﬁguration
(3, 3) and in this conﬁguration the coupled systems exhibit identical/complete
synchronization. Figures. 10(c), 11(c) and 13(c) clearly show the existence
of complete synchronization.

A summary of the nature of synchronizations is provided in detail in

Table 1.

3. Summary

In this paper we have developed a novel procedure by which lag, anticipa-
tory and complete sychronizations are observed in a coupled system without
using explicit time delay or parameter mismatch. We have experimentally
observed these synchronizations in a RC phase shifted network of modiﬁed
Chua’s ciruit and conﬁrmed the results by numerical studies for diﬀerent
coupling conﬁgurations. Anticipatory, complete and lag synchronizations
are observed when the second terminal of the response system is connected
to the ﬁrst, second and third terminals, respectively, of the drive system.
With a simple switching of the connecting terminals of the drive and the re-
sponse systems we observed diﬀerent types of chaotic synchronization. The
