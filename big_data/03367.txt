We report a detailed µSR study of the pressure evolution of the magnetic order in the manganese
based pnictide MnP, which has been recently found to undergo a superconducting transition under
pressure once the magnetic ground state is suppressed. Using the muon as a volume sensitive local
magnetic probe, we identify a ferromagnetic state as well as two incommensurate helical states
(with propagation vectors Q aligned along the crystallographic c− and b−directions, respectively)
which transform into each other through ﬁrst order phase transitions as a function of pressure and
temperature. Our data appear to support that the magnetic state from which superconductivity
develops at higher pressures is an incommensurate helical phase.

Recently, the binary pnictides CrAs and MnP have
attracted much interest due to discovery of supercon-
ductivity induced by hydrostatic pressure.1–4 The heli-
cal magnet CrAs becomes superconducting for pressures
exceeding p (cid:39) 0.4 GPa, whereas MnP possesses a criti-
cal pressure pc (cid:39) 8 GPa at which magnetism disappears
and superconductivity sets in. For CrAs, in the pressure
range of 0.4 (cid:46) p (cid:46) 0.7 GPa, one observes a phase separa-
tion between magnetic and paramagnetic volumes, with
the latter becoming superconducting with a critical tem-
perature Tc (cid:46) 2 K. Above 0.7 GPa the helical magnetic
order vanishes and superconductivity below Tc sets in
within the whole sample volume.5 Note that in CrAs the
single type of helical magnetic order remains unchanged
as a function pressure.5. In comparison to CrAs, MnP
possesses a more complicated phase diagram.4 At ambi-
ent pressure, MnP orders ferromagnetically at T (cid:39) 290 K
with the Mn magnetic moments aligned along the crystal-
lographic b−direction (according to the crystallographic
group P nma 62 with lattice constants c > a > b).6–8
The ordered moment is m (cid:39) 1.29 µB per Mn atom.6,9
At lower temperatures (T (cid:46) 50 K) another transition in
a double-spiral helical structure is reported.7,9,10 In this
helimagnetic state (helical−c state, Ref. 11) the Mn mo-
ments are rotated within the ab-plane (helical plane) with
the propagation vector Q = (0, 0, 0.117).7 By increasing
pressure the helical phase vanishes at p (cid:39) 1 − 1.5 GPa
and a new magnetic phase emerges for p (cid:38) 2 GPa.4 In
a narrow pressure region close to a critical pressure pc,
at which the new magnetic phase disappears, supercon-
ductivity is found below 1 K. It was suggested, there is a
quantum critical point at p = pc and that the quantum
ﬂuctuations persisting above pc give rise to occurrence
of superconductivity.4 Therefore, it is important to char-
acterize the high-pressure (HP) magnetic state of MnP
from which superconductivity emerges. At present, there
are three reports based on the results of non-resonant x-
ray, NMR, and neutron diﬀraction experiments pointing
to a helical magnetic order.11–13 Note, that the NMR

study does not allow one to identify the order, while the
non-resonant x-ray and neutron diﬀraction experiments
disagree on the type of HP helix. While the x-ray study
points to a similar helical−c structure as the one at ambi-
ent pressure, the neutron diﬀraction study suggests that
a conical or two-phase structure with Q (cid:107) b develops and
it gradually changes to the so-called helical−b structure
with Mn moments rotating within the ac-plane.

In this paper we report on a detailed study of the evolu-
tion of magnetic properties of MnP as a function of tem-
perature (5 K (cid:46) T (cid:46) 300 K) and pressure (0.1 MPa ≤
p (cid:46) 2.4 GPa) by means of muon-spin rotation (µSR).
The resulting p − T phase diagram (Fig. 1 a) consists of
three areas corresponding to the ferromagnetic (FM), the
helical−c (Hel−c) and the helical−b (Hel−b) orders with
the corresponding ﬁeld distributions [P (B)’s] presented
in Figs. 1 b, c and d, respectively. The phases FM/Hel−c
as well as FM/Hel−b are found to coexist within broad
range of pressures and temperatures. Transitions from
the high-temperature FM to the low-temperature low-
pressure (LT-LP) Hel−c, or the low-temperature high-
pressure (LT-HP) Hel−b phases are ﬁrst-order like. Our
experiments appear to conﬁrm that in MnP the high-
pressure magnetic phase which is the precursor of the
superconducting state is the incommensurate helical−b.
The magnetic response of MnP polycrystalline sample
was studied in zero ﬁeld (ZF) and weak transverse ﬁeld
(wTF) µSR experiments. A detailed description of µSR
experiments under pressure, the construction of the pres-
sure cell etc. are given in Ref. 14. In the following we
discuss the µSR data for the lowest (0.1 MPa) and the
highest (2.42 GPa) pressures.

At ambient pressure, transitions to two diﬀerent mag-
netic states are detected (Fig. 2 a). The ﬁrst one at
TFM (cid:39) 290 K corresponds to the ferromagnetic order.6,7
The spontaneous muon-spin precession is clearly ob-
served in the ZF µSR asymmetry spectra [A(t), Fig. 2 c].
The oscillatory part of A(t) is well ﬁtted by an exponen-
tially decaying cosine function with a zero initial phase

(see the Supplementary part), thus evidencing that the
magnetic order is commensurate.15 In the LT-LP region,
T (cid:46) 25 K, the oscillatory part of A(t) is accurately de-
scribed by a ﬁeld distribution characterized by a mini-
mum (Bmin) and a maximum (Bmax) cutoﬀ ﬁelds (see
Figs. 1 c and 2 e), which is consistent with the incom-
mensurate helimagnetic order.16 In a broad range of tem-
peratures (30 K (cid:46) T (cid:46) 50 K) both orders are detected
simultaneously (Fig. 2 d). Being a volume sensitive local
probe technique, µSR allows to follow the temperature
evolution of both magnetic phases as demonstrated in
Fig. 2 a. The corresponding internal ﬁelds in the FM
(Bint) and Hel−c (Bmin, Bmax) phases are presented in
Fig. 2 b. The internal magnetic ﬁeld in the FM phase
(i.e., the FM magnetic order parameter) decreases with
increasing temperature and vanishes at TFM. Analyzing
the data with a power law

Bint(T ) = Bint(T = 0)[1 − (T /TFM)α]β

(1)

yields TFM = 289.0(2) K, Bint(T = 0) = 0.2925(2) T,
α = 1.16(1) and β = 0.252(3). The value of β lies quite
close to the critical exponent β (cid:39) 1/3 expected for a sec-
ond order phase transition in a 3D magnetic system.17 In
contrast, both Bmin and Bmax, which are measures of the
magnetic order parameter of the Hel−c state, abruptly
drop to zero at the phase transition (Fig. 2 b). This, to-
gether with the coexistence of the FM and Hel−c phases
in a relatively large temperature region of ∼ 20 K indi-
cates the ﬁrst order character of the transition.

At p = 2.42 GPa, the transition into the FM state

is clearly detected via the observation of a spontaneous
muon-spin precession frequency for temperatures below
250 K. Upon decreasing the temperature, another phase,
with an internal ﬁeld approximately 2.5 times higher,
starts to develop for T (cid:46) 200 K and occupies the full
sample volume for T (cid:46) 50 K (Figs. 3a and b). This
phase corresponds to the ‘unknown antiferromagnetic’
phase which was ﬁrst reported in Ref. 4. A preliminary
analysis reveals that the oscillatory part of the µSR sig-
nal in the LT-HP phase is well ﬁtted by the Gaussian
decaying cosine function with zero initial phase. The
temperature dependences of the magnetic volume frac-
tions and the internals ﬁelds obtained for the FM and
LT-HP phases are shown in Figs. 3 a and b. The asym-
metry spectra taken at T (cid:39) 200 K (FM phase), (cid:39) 100 K
(mixture of FM and LT-HP magnetic phases), and (cid:39) 5 K
(LT-HP magnetic phase) are shown in panel c, d, and e,
respectively.

At ﬁrst glance the ambient pressure and p = 2.42 GPa
data presented in Figs. 2 and 3 look similar. Indeed, (i)
in both cases the ferromagnetic phase observed at high
temperatures is fully replaced by a LT phase. (ii) within
a broad range of temperatures the ferromagnetic and LT
phases coexist. (iii) the appearance of the LT phase is
always associated with an abrupt change of the internal
ﬁeld (magnetic order parameter), i.e. there is a ﬁrst order
transition between the FM and both LT phases.

There is, however, an important diﬀerence between
them. At ambient pressure the Mn moments form the
so-called ‘double helical’ structure with the propagation

whether this phase has a non-zero net magnetic moment.
Following Fig. S2 in the Supplementary part of Ref. 4 the
ferromagnetic component of the LT-HP phase might be
quite substantial and correspond to ∼ 5− 20% of that in
the FM phase. The authors of Ref. 11 have also suggested
a conical magnetic structure for p (cid:38) 1.5 GPa with a ferro-
magnetic component gradually decreasing with decreas-
ing temperature and increasing pressure. We checked for
a possible ferromagnetic component by studying the pres-
sure cell response in a wTF µSR experiments. Note that
the spins of the muons stopping in the pressure cell con-
taining the magnetic sample will undergo a precession
around the vector sum of the weak externally applied
ﬁeld and the straight ﬁelds induced by the sample.
If
these straight ﬁelds are sizable and inhomogeneous, as
expected around a ferromagnetic sample, the µSR signal
of the muons stopping in the cell will exhibit a relaxation
due to dephasing.18 Figure 4 shows the temperature de-
pendence of an additional exponential relaxation of the
spin polarization for the muons stopping in the pressure
cell (λpc). The magnetic ﬁeld µ0H = 10 mT, trans-
verse to the initial muon-spin polarization, was applied at
T (cid:39) 300 K (above the magnetic transition). For compar-
ison we also plot in this graph the temperature evolution
of the ferromagnetic volume fraction (fFM = fm−fhel−b)
as obtained in ZF µSR experiments (Fig. 3a). Below
T (cid:39) 250 K λpc follows exactly fFM. With decreasing tem-
perature both quantities ﬁrst increase, thus showing the
formation of the FM phase. Both, λpc and fFM, saturate
at T (cid:39) 200 K, and then decrease almost linearly with
temperature decrease from (cid:39) 200 K down to (cid:39) 50 K.
Below 50 K, where the FM phase completely vanishes,
the signal of the pressure cell becomes unaﬀected by the
sample. This proves that the magnetic order induced by
high pressure in MnP sample possesses no sizable ferro-
magnetic component and allows one to exclude from the
consideration the conical magnetic structure.

Additional experiments performed in the intermediate
range of pressures (p = 0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 1.56, 1.8, 2.05, and

vector Q = (0, 0, 0.117). Considering 4 Mn atoms per
unit cell, the term ‘double helical’ means that the Mn
spins are coupled in pairs (Mn1/Mn4 and Mn2/Mn3),
and rotate with a constant phase diﬀerence between the
diﬀerent pairs along Q (see Ref. 7). Such an incommensu-
rate magnetic structure leads to a ﬁeld distribution given
by:16

and is characterized by two peaks at a minimum (Bmin)
and a maximum(Bmax) cutoﬀ ﬁeld (Fig. 1 c).

The magnetic ﬁeld distribution in the LT-HP phase is,
however, diﬀerent. It is characterized by a single sym-
metric line (Fig. 1 d), though with a very broad width.
At ﬁrst glance such P (B) is inconsistent with the helical
order. However, as shown below, the unique situation
realized in MnP may lead to the formation of a quasi-
single peak structure. In short, in MnP muons stop at
four well deﬁned interstitial lattice sites within the unit
cell. The µSR asymmetry spectra consists, therefore, of
four contributions with each of them characterized by its
own Bmin and Bmax ﬁelds and corresponding P (B)’s de-
scribed by Eq. (2). Under certain conditions which, as
shown in the Supplementary part, are fulﬁlled in MnP for
a helical−b magnetic order, the sum of the four asymmet-
ric P (B) distributions results in a single broad symmetric
line.

for consistency of the LT-HP magnetic phase with 3 pos-
sible collinear antiferromagnetic structures reported in
Ref. 26 and the helical structure proposed in Ref. 12. The
analysis reveals that none of them are consistent with the
experimental data (see the Supplementary part).
To test whether the helical−b structure proposed in
Ref. 11 is compatible with our data, we started ﬁrst by
calculating the Bmin and Bmax ﬁelds for each particu-
lar muon site in the range of −0.14 ≤ δ ≤ 0.14 and
−0.16 ≤ e ≤ 0.16. Here δ is the component of the propa-
gation vector Q = (0, δ, 0) (the positive and the negative
sign correspond to a right and a left-handed helix, respec-
tively) and e = (ma−mc)/(ma+mc) is the eccentricity of
the elliptical helical−b structure (ma and mc are compo-
nents of m along the a− and c−axis, respectively). With
such determined sets of Bmin’s and Bmax’s the experi-
mental asymmetry spectra were ﬁtted. The correlation
plots χ2(δ, e) and m(δ, e) allow us to check for the range
of consistency of helical−b structure with the experimen-
tal data and to obtain the value of the average moment
m. With δ = ±0.09 (Ref. 11), e and m were found to
range −0.025 (cid:46) e (cid:46) 0.05 and 1.175 µB (cid:46) m (cid:46) 1.190 µB,
respectively. Note that the value of m in the helical−b
state is close to that determined in the ferromagnetic
state mFM = 1.17 µB. The details of calculations are
summarized in the Supplementary Information.
To conclude, the muon-spin rotation measurements of
MnP under the pressure up to (cid:39) 2.4 GPa were carried
out. The ferromagnetic ordering temperature and the
value of the ordered Mn moments decrease with the pres-
sure increase from TFM = 289.0(2) K and m = 1.29 µB
at p = 0.1 MPa, to TFM = 242.0(2.2) K and m = 1.17 µB
at p = 2.42 GPa, respectively. For pressures in the re-
gion 0.1 MPa ≤ p (cid:46) 1.2 GPa the ferromagnetic and the
LT-HP helical−c types of magnetic order were clearly
detected. The helical−c order becomes completely sup-
pressed for pressures exceeding 1.5 GPa. Above this
pressure the third magnetic phase, the helical−b phase,11
starts to grow. The transition temperature and the vol-
ume fraction of the helical−b phase increase continuously
with increasing pressure. At p = 2.42 Ga the helical−b
phase was clearly detected up to T (cid:39) 200 K. Pairs
of phases, FM/Hel−c and FM/Hel−b, coexist within
broad range of pressures and temperatures. Transitions
from the HT FM to the LT-LP helical−c, or the LT-HP
helical−b phases are ﬁrst-order like.

2.20 GPa) allow us to construct the full p − T phase
diagram as shown in Fig. 1a.
It resembles the one re-
ported in Ref. 4, with, however, some important diﬀer-
ences. Firstly, the transition temperature of the FM state
changes quite monotonically with pressure without a pro-
nounced dTc/dp slope change at p ∼ 2 GPa. The slope
dTc/dp = −17.5(9) K/GPa is in agreement with the re-
sults of Banus19 reporting dTc/dp = −18.5 K/GPa for
pressures ranging 0 ≤ p (cid:46) 2.0 GPa. Secondly, there is
a broad temperature range where FM and Hel−c (LT-
LP), and FM and Hel−b (LT-HP) orders coexist. We do
not detect, however, any coexistence of Hel−c and Hel−b
magnetic orders.

All above conclusions do not require any particular
modeling and are obvious already from the µSR raw
data. To obtain more quantitative information cal-
culations of local ﬁelds (Bloc) at the muon stopping
sites were carried out. The muon site was determined
based on the density-functional theory (DFT) approach,
which was shown to accurately determine the muon
sites in diﬀerent materials as e.g. wide-gap semiconduc-
tors, insulating systems or cuprate and iron-based high-
Tc superconductors.20–25 There are four equivalent min-
ima in the unit cell corresponding to the 4c [(x, 1/4, z),
xµ = 0.103, zµ = 0.921] Wyckoﬀ position (see the Sup-
plementary part). The calculations were started from
the known FM and Hel−c magnetic structures at ambi-
ent pressure (see Refs. 6,7,9,10). From this ﬁrst step one
could determine the coupling contact constant Acont (cid:39)
−0.447 T/µB. As a next step, by assuming Acont and the
relative positions of Mn ions and muon within the unit
cell are pressure independent, as well as accounting for
the pressure reduction of lattice constants,12 the pressure
dependence of the ordered moment m in the FM state
was calculated (Fig. 5). The internal ﬁeld at T = 0 was
obtained from the ﬁt of Bint(T ) by means of Eq. 1 mea-
sured at each particular pressure . We have also checked

A. Sample preparation

The manganese phosphide (MnP) polycrystalline sam-
ple was synthesized by using a high-pressure furnace.
Overall details of the sample cell assembly and high-
pressure synthesis process can be found in Ref. S1. The
mixture of manganese powder (99.99%) and red phospho-
rus powder (99.999%) in a molar ratio 1:1 was enclosed in
a boron-nitride crucible and placed inside a pyrophyllite
cube with a graphite heater. All the preparatory steps
were done in a glove box under argon atmosphere.
In
a typical run, the sample was compressed up to 1 GPa
at room temperature. While keeping pressure constant,
the temperature was ramped up within 3 h to the max-
imum value of 1200 oC, kept stable for 1 h, then cooled
to 950 oC in 14 h and ﬁnally quenched to the room tem-
perature. Afterwards, the pressure was released and the
ﬁnal solid product removed. Subsequently recorded x-ray
powder diﬀraction patterns showed no secondary phases.

B. Experimental Techniques

1. Pressure Cell

The pressure was generated in a double-wall piston-
cylinder type of cell made of MP35N alloy. As a pressure
transmitting medium 7373 Daphne oil was used. The
pressure was measured in situ by monitoring the pressure
shift of the superconducting transition temperature of In.
The details of the experimental setup for conducting µSR
under pressure experiments are given in Ref. S2.

2. Muon-spin rotation

µSR measurements at zero ﬁeld (ZF) and ﬁeld applied
transverse to the initial muon-spin polarization were per-
formed at the πM3 and µE1 beamlines (Paul Scherrer
Institute, Villigen, Switzerland), by using the dedicated
GPS and GPDS2 spectrometers, respectively. At the
GPS spectrometer, equipped with continues ﬂow 4He
cryostat, ZF experiments at ambient pressure and down
to temperatures 1.6 K were carried out. At the GPD
spectrometer, equipped with continuous ﬂow 4He cryo-
stat (base temperature (cid:39) 2.2 K), ZF, and 10 mT weak
transverse ﬁeld (wTF) µSR experiments under pressure
up to ∼2.4 GPa were conducted. All ZF experiments
were performed by stabilizing the temperature prior to
recording the muon-time spectra. In wTF experiments
the temperature was swept up with the rate (cid:39) 0.2 K/min.
The data were collected continuously. Each muon-time
spectra was recorded during approximately 5 minutes.

At ambient pressure MnP is either in the paramagnetic
state (PM, T (cid:38) 290 K) or exhibits ferromagnetic (FM,
50 (cid:46) T (cid:46) 290 K) or helical-c (Hel−c, T (cid:46) 50 K) magnetic
order.

In the PM state the muon-spin polarization is well de-

scribed by the single exponential decay function:

P PM(t) = e−λt.

(S1)

Here λ is the exponential relaxation rate.

In the FM state the muon-spin polarization follows:

P FM(t) =

e−λT t cos(γµBintt) +

e−λLt,

3

(S2)

where Bint is the internal ﬁeld on the muon stopping
site, γµ = 2π 135.5 MHz/T is the muon gyromagnetic
ratio, and λT and λL are the transverse and the longi-
tudinal exponential relaxation rates, respectively. The
occurrence of 2/3 oscillating and 1/3 non oscillating µSR
signal fractions originates from the spatial averaging in
powder samples, where 2/3 of the magnetic ﬁeld com-
ponents are perpendicular to the muon-spin and cause a
precession, while the 1/3 longitudinal ﬁeld components
do not.
In the helical−c state the magnetic ﬁeld distribution is
characterized by two peaks due to the minimum (Bmin)
and maximum(Bmax) cutoﬀ ﬁelds (see the Fig. 1c in the
main text). Following Ref. S3 the muon-spin polarization
for the helical type of magnetic order is well described as:
e−λT tJ0(γµ∆Bt) cos(γµBavt) + (S3)

3

P Hel(t) =

e−λLt.

+

Here J0 is the zeroth order Bessel function of the ﬁrst
kind, and the widths of the distribution ∆B and the
average ﬁeld Bav are ∆B = (Bmax − Bmin)/2 and
Bav = (Bmax + Bmin)/2, respectively.

Considering three above described states the ZF-µSR
asymmetry spectra of MnP at ambient pressure were an-
alyzed as:

As(t) = As(0){(1 − fm)P PM(t) +

+fm[(1 − fHel)P FM(t) + fHelP Hel(t)]}.

(S4)

Here As(0) is the initial asymmetry at t = 0, and fm
and fHel are the total magnetic volume fraction and the
volume fraction of the helical phase, respectively.

In pressure experiments a large fraction of the muons,
roughly 50%, stops in the pressure cell walls. The ﬁt
function consists of the ”sample” and the background
(pressure cell) contributions and is described as:

A(t) = As(0)Ps(t) + Apc(0)Ppc(t).

(S5)

Here As(0) and Apc(0) are the initial asymmetries and
Ps(t) and Ppc(t) are the muon-spin polarizations belong-
ing to the sample and the pressure cell, respectively. The

polarization of the pressure cell is generally studied in
separated set of experiments.S2
For pressures ranging from 0.1 MPa to (cid:39) 1.2 GPa,
where the MnP sample obeys transition from the FM to
the Hel−c state (see Fig. 1 a), the sample response was
analyzed by using Eq. S4 with the individual components
described by Eqs. S1, S2, and S3, respectively.
For pressures above 1.5 GPa the response of the sample
in the Hel−b phase, was found to be well described as:

P FM(t) =

T t2/2 cos(γµBintt) +

e−λLt,

3

(S6)

int (cid:39) 2.5BFM

where σT is the transverse Gaussian relaxation rate.
The average internal ﬁeld in the Hel−b phase is ap-
proximately 2.5 times higher than that in the FM phase
(BHel−b
int , Figs. 3 b, c and e in the main text).
Such big diﬀerence allows us easy to distinguish between
contributions of FM and Hel−b phases in the µSR asym-
metry spectra. Fits were made by using Eq. S4 with the
’Hel‘ part replaced by the ’Hel−b‘ one and the individ-
ual components were described by Eqs. S1, S2, and S6,
respectively.

D. wTF µSR data analysis procedure

Samples with a strong magnetization placed in a pres-
sure cell may induce a magnetic ﬁeld in the space around
the sample. Typical examples of such samples are super-
conductors (strong diamagnets), superparamagnets, and
ferro- or ferrimagnets. Thus, muons stopping in a pres-
sure cell containing the sample will undergo precession
in the vector sum of the applied ﬁeld and the ﬁeld in-
duced by the sample. This spatially inhomogeneous ﬁeld
leads to an additional depolarization of the muon spin
polarization, which depends on the applied ﬁeld and the
induced ﬁeld together with the spatial stopping distribu-
tion of the muons.S4

Figure S1 shows weak-transverse ﬁeld (wTF) µSR
asymmetry spectra taken at p = 2.42 GPa and T = 205 K
(panel a), 123 K (panel b) and 21 K (panel c). The mag-
netic ﬁeld µ0H = 10 mT was applied at T (cid:39) 300 K
(above the magnetic transition). Note that signals in
Fig. S1 are mostly determined by the muons stopped in
the pressure cell walls. The sample contribution, with in-
ternal ﬁelds Bint (cid:39) 250 mT in the FM state or (cid:39) 800 mT
in the Hel−b state, is suppressed with the proper selec-
tion of ’binning‘ [data points were grouped together with
the corresponding ﬁnal step of (cid:39) 70 ns ((cid:39) 1 mT)]. Ob-
viously, at T = 205 K there is a strong inﬂuence of the
sample magnetization on the pressure cell response. It
becomes much weaker at T = 123 K and vanishes at
T = 21 K. Note that at T = 21 K the signal corresponds
to the undistorted pressure cell response.

The data presented in Fig. S1 were analyzed by using

the following functional form:
Apc(t) = Apc(0) e−λpct e−σ2

Internal ﬁelds on muon stopping sites

1. MnP unit cell

The orthorhombic crystal structure of MnP (P nma,
62) is shown in Fig. S2. The unit cell dimensions are a =
5.268 ˚A, b = 3.172 ˚A and c = 5.918 ˚A at ambient pressure
and room temperature. Both the Mn and the P atoms
occupy the 4c (x, 1/4, z) crystallographic positions with
xMn = 0.0049(2), zMn = 0.1965(2) and xP = 0.1878(5),
zP = 0.5686(5).S5

was performed with the method described in Ref. S7.

total energy diﬀerences between the possible interstitial
sites is reported in Table I.

The identiﬁcation of multiple candidate sites

is
not an unexpected feature of DFT based muon site
assignements.S7,S15,S16,S17,S18 This is partially caused by
the structural optimization algorithm which neglects
both the zero point motion energy of the muon and the
eﬀects of temperature. Molecular dynamics approaches
would substantially improve the accuracy of the results,
but they would also result in a tremendous increase of
the computational costs. The selected convergence cri-
teria may also cause the relaxation algorithm to stop in
conﬁgurations which are not real minima but rather con-
stitute a ﬂat area between diﬀerent interstitial positions.
Since only one frequency is observed in the FM phase of
MnP, it is reasonable to assume that only one fully pop-
ulated muon site is present in this material. Simulations
performed with the double adiabatic approximation and
the exploration algorithm discussed in Ref. S7 show that
the energy barrier binding the muon in site 1 is larger
than 0.5 eV while the same analysis shows that sites 4
and 5 cannot bind a muon since their energy barriers
are of the order of 0.1 eV. Site 1 was therefore selected
for the subsequent analysis of the experimental data (see
Fig. S2).

3. Local ﬁeld on the muon stopping site

Muons probe the local ﬁeld, which is the vector sum
of the internal (dipolar) magnetic ﬁeld and the contact
ﬁeld at a particular site. The spontaneous local ﬁeld for
the site i was calculated as:

Bloc,i = Bdip,i + Bcont,i

FIG. S2: The orthorhombic crystal structure of MnP (P nma,
62). The muon stopping positions were obtained by ab −
initio calculations (see text for details). The structure was
visualized by using VESTA.S6

proach as implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO
suite of codes.S8 The reciprocal space was sampled with
a 6 × 8 × 12 Monkhorst-Pack grid.S9 The exchange-
correlation functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof
and the Methfessel-Paxton scheme with 0.01 Ry smear-
ing were used.S10,S11,S12 The ultrasoft pseudopotentials
described in Ref.S13 and a basis set expanded up to a
kinetic-energy cutoﬀ of 70 Ry and up to 500 Ry for charge
density were adopted.

These settings guarantee an accurate description of the
crystalline structure of the material. In the collinear spin
formalism, at ambient pressure, the ferromagnetic state
has the lowest enthalpy and it is therefore consider as the
ground state for the structural relaxations of the impurity
in the suprecells.

A supercell containing 129 atoms (including the muon
which is described as a hydrogen atom) is used to locate
the possible interstitial embedding positions occupied by
the muon. To get a reasonable compromise between
speed and accuracy, the kinetic energy cutoﬀ and the
charge density cutoﬀ were reduced to 60 Ry and 400 Ry
respectively. The Baldereschi point k = (1/4, 1/4, 1/4)
was used to sample the reciprocal space.S14 The lattice
cell parameters were kept ﬁxed during the relaxation.
A grid of 4 × 4 × 4 initial interstitial positions was se-
lected to explore the whole interstitial space of the unit
cell and identify all the possible embedding sites. Af-
ter removing the positions too close to the atoms of the
hosting system (less than 1 ˚A) and disregarding sym-
metry equivalent sites, the set of 9 interstitial locations
was obtained. The structural relaxations were performed
with the convergence criteria set to 10−4 Ry for the total
energy and to 10−3 Ry/a.u. for forces. Five interstitial
positions have been identiﬁed with this procedure. The

the component of the propagation vector Q = (0, δ, 0) (the positive and the negative sign correspond to the right and the left-
and right-handed helix, respectively) and e = (ma − mc)/(ma + mc) is the eccentricity of the elliptical helical−b structure (ma
and mc are components of m along the a− and c−axis, respectively). Black dots correspond to set of (δ, e) points where the

tance between the muon and j-th magnetic moment.

The contact ﬁeld Bcont was calculated by using Eq. S10
by considering 3 nearest neighbours for each particular
muon site.

4. Comparison of the HP-LT magnetic phase with the
helical−c structure from Ref. S20 and collinear AFM

structures from Ref. S21

The calculations of the local ﬁelds on the muon sites
were started from the known ferromagnetic and dou-
ble helical magnetic structures at ambient pressure (see
Refs. S22,S23,S24,S25). This allows us to determine the
coupling contact constant Acont (cid:39) −0.447 T/µB. Using
the so determined Acont and assuming that the relative
positions of Mn atoms and muons are independent on
pressure, the pressure dependence of Mn moment in the
FM state (Fig. 5 in the main text) was obtained. The
pressure dependence of the lattice constants a, b, and c
was taken from Ref. S20.
Calculations of the local ﬁelds at the muon sites for
HP helical−c structure with the propagation vector Q =
(0, 0, 0.25 + δ), suggested in Ref. S20, were performed by
assuming that the coupling contact constant Acont and

the relative positions of Mn atoms and muons are inde-
pendent on pressure. With m = 1.17 µB per Mn atom
two pairs of helical distributions with Bmin/Bmax ﬁeld
0.194/0.783 T and 0.236/0.587 T were obtained, which
is inconsistent with the single-peak ﬁeld distribution pre-
sented in Fig. 1 d in the main text.

Gercsi and Sandeman Ref. S21 have shown that 3
collinear antiferromagnetic structures could be realized
in MnP. The results of the calculations are summa-
rized in Table II. None of the structures result in Bloc
values comparable with the experimentally determined
Bint(5 K) (cid:39) 0.827 T.

bient pressure data.

Mn moments are coupled in pairs (Mn1/Mn2 and

Q = (0, δ, 0). The magnetic moment was found to be
elongated along the crystallographic a−axis. At p (cid:39)
1.8 GPa and T = 6 K, δ (cid:39) 0.09 and the elongation of the
moment e = (ma − mc)/(ma + mc) is 0.15(8).S26

The test of the helical−b structure was started form the
calculations of Bmin and Bmax ﬁelds for each particular
muon site in the range of −0.14 ≤ δ ≤ 0.14 and −0.16 ≤
e ≤ 0.16 (black dots in Fig. S3). With such determined
sets of Bmin and Bmax the oscillatory part of the muon-
asymmetry spectra was ﬁtted to:

Here i denotes the i−th muon site, σi is a Gaussian re-
laxation rate, ωi is the weight (ωi = 0.25 in our case since
all four muon sites are equivalent), ∆Bi = C ∗ (Bmax,i −
Bmin,i)/2, and Bav,i = C ∗ (Bmax,i + Bmin,i)/2. The
parameter C accounts for the possible deviation of the
magnetic moment m from m = 1.17 µB as determined
from calculations in the FM state (see Fig. 5 in the main
text). Note that according to Eqs. S8, S9, and S10 the lo-
cal ﬁeld at the muon stoping site is directly proportional
to m.

The goodness of ﬁts were checked by using the χ2 cri-
teria. As follows from Fig. S3 a for certain values of δ and
e the helical−b structure becomes consistent with the ex-
perimental data. The magnetic moment as a function of
δ and e is presented in Fig. S3 b. The µSR time-spectra
and ﬁts within the helical−b model for two representative
sets of δ and e parameters are shown in Fig. S4.
