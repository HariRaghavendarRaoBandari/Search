Abstract. We propose a novel approach for solving the scattering of light onto a
two-level atom coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. We ﬁrst express the physical
quantity of interest in terms of Feynman diagrams and treat the atom as a non-
saturable linear beamsplitter. By using the atomic response to our advantage, a
relevant substitution is then made that captures the nonlinearity of the atom, and
the ﬁnal result is obtained in terms of simple integrals over the initial incoming
wavepackets. The procedure is not limited to post-scattering quantities and allows
for instance to derive the atomic excitation during the scattering event.

1. Introduction

Solving analytically the scattering of an arbitrary state of light onto a quantum emitter
is a long-standing problem in Quantum Optics. Over the past decade, it has become
more and more relevant in the context of waveguide QED where the light ﬁeld is
strongly conﬁned along a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide, eﬀectively enhancing the
light-matter interaction. Rapid experimental progress is being made in this ﬁeld, with
unprecedented coupling eﬃciency for cesium atoms trapped near a 1D alligator photonic
crystal waveguide [1], and almost perfect coupling in superconducting-qubit [2] and
quantum-dot [3] based architectures. Such integrable platforms are especially promising
for using the atom as a mediator of photon-photon interaction [4], inducing non-trivial
correlations at the level of a few photons [5], and for testing proposals such as quantum
networks [6, 7].

From the theory point of view, the most elementary system of waveguide QED
consists of a single two-level atom coupled to a 1D waveguide. This system has
stimulated a lot of research aiming to characterize how would some speciﬁc states of
light be scattered in an experiment. Of the most notable is the seminal work [8] by
P. Domokos and co-authors who tackled the scattering of a singe-photon pulse as well
as coherent states. J. T. Shen and S. Fan later introduced a powerful framework based on

contributes in (2)) onto a two-level atom. The photons do not need to be identical and
can have arbitrary proﬁles, including correlations prior to the scattering event.

the Lippmann-Schwinger (L-S) equation for solving the transport of a single photon [9]
and the predicted extinction at resonance has been observed experimentally with low-
power coherent states [2, 3]. While the transport of two photons has been successfully
addressed immediately after [10], it was not until last year that several theoretical
proposals have been put forward to deal in a systematic way with the scattering of N
arbitrary photons. Among these are versatile approaches that leave aside the nature of
the scatterer and could in principle be applied to a wide variety of systems [11, 12]. In
the speciﬁc case of a two-level atom, an important step has been achieved in [13] where
the authors extended the L-S framework to the scattering of N photons.

The present work is motivated by the fact that the two-level atom is one of the
simplest nonlinear scatterer one could think of. As such, there should be a way of
describing the scattering event – including the dynamics – with few computations.
Moreover, this becomes more than a theoretical challenge as current experiments are
about to enter the realm of reliably generating arbitrary photonic states [14, 15].
Here we propose a systematic method, which for the ﬁrst time not only explains how
entanglement between the photons emerges during the scattering event, but uses this
very knowledge to greatly simplify the theoretical description. The key diﬀerence with
recent eﬀorts is that the end-user does not need to compute the system dynamics and
recalculate the response function for each arbitrary number of incoming photons N.
Instead, our main result is the operational translation of the well-known statement that
a two-level atom can only absorb or emit at most one photon at a given time.

2. Model

We consider the system illustrated in ﬁgure 1, consisting of a 1D waveguide strongly
coupled to a two-level atom with transition frequency ωA between ground |gi and
excited |ei states much larger than the cutoﬀ frequency of the waveguide. The dipole
Hamiltonian describing the interaction between the atom and propagating photons,
under rotating wave approximation, is then given by [8]

where gω is the coupling constant and ˆa(
ω ) is the annihilation operator of the left-
(right-) propagating photon mode at frequency ω. In the following we will work with the
Weisskopf-Wigner approximation, where the decay rate of the atom to the waveguide
reads γ ≡ 2πg2

ω (ˆa*

2πR dω f(ω)e−i(ω−ωA)τ, where τ is the time distance from the wavefront.

A key step to reveal the physics of the atom’s impact on the scattered light is to
work in the time domain. We will use the following convention for the Fourier transform
√
F[f](τ) = 1/
The wavefront is associated to the ﬁrst wavepacket that reaches the atom and sets the
start of the scattering event. It therefore coincidences with the atom’s position at initial
time t = 0. With this knowledge, we can now express the incoming state for a light ﬁeld
composed of N photons in the time domain as

the bosonic exchange symmetry.

Our results are obtained by deriving the Heisenberg equations for the atom and

Here the ﬁrst term corresponds to the relaxation of an initially excited atom while the
last term is less straightforward to interpret. Indeed, if the atom was to respond like a
linear beamsplitter, i.e. without being saturated and dealing with each photon as if the
others were absent, this last term would eﬀectively have the form

(5)
which is simply the emission of a photon at time t that could have been absorbed at
anytime t0 from the start of the scattering event. The probability of absorption appears
here in the form of the atomic exponential response function, which ensures that the
photon is most likely to have been absorbed in a time window of order γ−1 before the
emission. As a side comment, the minus sign corresponds to the well-known π phase
shift from a dipole emission [17].

photons. (a) Both photons did not interact with the atom. (b) and (c) Only one of
the photons has been absorbed and reemitted. (d) Both photons have been emitted
by the atom.

It is important to note here that the linear form (5) is not derived with the use
of the weak-excitation limit, where one would typically assume that the atom mostly
stays in the ground state and ˆσz → −1 is set by hand. Instead, we use the argument
that once ˆd0 has removed from the initial state a photon being scattered in the linear
regime, the subsequent atomic operator ˆσz in (4) eﬀectively acts on the empty state
|vaci ⊗ |gi, yielding −1. In fact, one way to naturally visualize the linear regime is to
imagine that the incoming photons are being sent on a set of N colocated atoms, where
each atom only sees one photon. This pictures that the atomic response to each photon
is dictated by the single-photon regime, which is the essence of the linear regime, while
no assumption is being made on the excitation of the atom.

Coming back to the actual response of the system (4), it is therefore the presence
of ˆσz(t0) that translates the nature of the atom as a saturable nonlinear scatterer and
imposes, somehow, that the atom can only absorb or emit at most one photon at a
given time. In the following, we will prove this statement and show how to use it to our
advantage when describing a scattering event.

3. Demonstrating the method in the 2-photon case

In this section we will restrict ourselves to the case of a two-photon pulse incoming
onto the atom initially in the ground state, that is |ψini = |ψ2i ⊗ |gi. Here the goal is
to introduce our novel approach in this preliminary situation before proceeding to the
general case.

In a scattering event, one is typically interested in the evolution of wavepackets as
a function of time. In particular, the L-S formalism gives access to the long-time limit
of these wavepackets [10, 13, 18]. To illustrate our method, let us study the wavepacket
associated with counter-propagating photons f1(τ1, τ2, t) ≡ h∅| ˆa(
τ1(t)|ψini, where
|∅i = |vaci⊗|gi and the initial state (2) implies f1(τ1, τ2, 0) = ξ1(τ1, τ2). Note that this
does not restrict the class of input states |ψini but is merely a choice of what output
we wish to look at, here being coincidence events. The study of the other wavepackets
follows the same procedure.

3.1. Step 1: drawing Feynman diagrams
First, we start by decomposing the possibilities of having counter-propagating photons
in terms of Feynman diagrams. Speciﬁcally, these diagrams correspond to the possible
photonic paths that shall be summed in order to obtain the amplitude of the process
under study [19]. Note that, contrary to particle physics [20], our system does not call
for a perturbative expansion as we can exhaustively list all the contributing diagrams.
This is a direct consequence of the fact that each photon is only given a single chance
to interact with the atom.

The diagrams are shown in ﬁgure 2 and translate as

ˆa(
τ2(t) ˆa*

τ1(t) = ˆa(

τ2(0) ˆa*

+ θ(t − τ1)θ(t − τ2)Thˆσ−(τ2) ˆσ−(τ1)i

τ2(0) + θ(t − τ2) ˆσ−(τ2) ˆa*
,

τ1(0)
(6)

where the Heaviside functions ensure that a photon that has not yet reached the atom
cannot originate from an atomic emission. Note that another straightforward way of
obtaining this decomposition would be to substitute the solution of (3b).

The ﬁrst thing to notice at this stage is that all the terms in the ﬁrst line of (6)
are trivially linear and contribute to f1(τ1, τ2, t) as simple functions of the incoming
wavepackets

h∅| ˆa(
τ2(0) ˆa*
h∅| ˆσlin− (τ1) ˆa(

Therefore in the process of solving the scattering of two photons, it is the last term
of (6), which involves two successive atomic emissions, that calls for a more thorough
analysis.

3.2. Step 2: treating the atom as a non-saturable linear beamsplitter with a twist
Let us assume here that τ2 is greater than τ1 without loss of generality. If the atom was
a linear scatterer (5), the last term in (6) would read

h∅| ˆσlin− (τ2) ˆσlin− (τ1)|ψini =

Now our main result is that the actual atomic response is in fact of the form

h∅| ˆσ−(τ2) ˆσ−(τ1)|ψini = h∅| ˆσlin− (τ2, τ1) ˆσlin− (τ1)|ψini ,

where

Z τ2

ˆσlin− (τ2, τ1) ≡ −

(10)
takes into account the fact that the photon emitted at τ2 has necessarily been absorbed
after the emission of the ﬁrst photon at τ1. Therefore, in practice, one simply needs

dt0 e−(τ2−t0) ˆd0(t0),

to shift the start of the ﬁrst integral in the linear expression (8) in order to fully
grasp the impact of the atomic nonlinearity onto the scattered light without doing any
computation. This simple substitution concludes the derivation of f1(τ1, τ2, t) which is
now expressed solely in terms of simple integrals over the incoming wavepackets.

3.3. Proof of the main result in the two-photon case
We will now present a detailed proof of the main result (9) for the input state
|ψini = |ψ2i ⊗ |gi. We start by expressing the nonlinear term using (4)

h∅| ˆσ−(τ2) ˆσ−(τ1)|ψini =

dt0 e−(τ1−t0) h∅| ˆσ−(τ2) ˆσz(t0) ˆd0(t0)|ψini , (11)

Z τ1

0

where we recall that τ2 is assumed to be greater than τ1.

As pointed out in section 2, it is the presence of ˆσz(t0) that dictates the nonlinear
response of the atom. However at this level it is not clear yet how to interpret its role.
In order to proceed further, we will use the solution of (3a)

ˆσz(t0) = e−2t0hˆ1 + ˆσz(0)i − 1 − 2

dt00 e−2(t0−t00)hˆσ+(t00) ˆd0(t00) + H.ci

.(12)

This gives us four contributions as follows

of initial excitation in the atom;

0 dt0 e−(τ1−t0)e−2t0 h∅| ˆσ−(τ2)hˆ1 + ˆσz(0)i ˆd0(t0)|ψini = 0 where we used the absence

0 dt0 e−(τ1−t0) h∅| ˆσ−(τ2) ˆd0(t0)|ψini = h∅| ˆσlin− (τ2) ˆσlin− (τ1)|ψini which corresponds
to a linear scatterer (8). The remaining terms will thus contain the nonlinear cor-
rection.

substituted ˆσ−(t00) using (3c).

Changing the order of integration between t00 and t000
in the last contribution and
performing the integral over t00, one is left with a term that cancels the third contribution
plus an additional term, the nonlinear correction, which reads

3.4. Atomic excitation during the scattering event
In fact, our method is not limited to describing the eﬀect of the atom onto the light
but also proves useful for instance to track the atomic excitation during the scattering
event. Indeed, the probability of excitation is given by

(14)

which corresponds to an excitation being present in the atom at time t while the other
photon is propagating in any direction.

Following step 1, we ﬁrst express the photon ﬁeld in terms of Feynman diagrams

as illustrated in ﬁgure 3
ˆσ−(t) ˆa*

τ (t) = ˆσ−(t) ˆa*

τ (0) + θ(t − τ) ˆσ−(t) ˆσ−(τ),

and similarly for ˆσ−(t) ˆa(
τ (t). Again the ﬁrst term’s contribution is trivially linear and
is readily given in terms of the initial wavepackets as shown in (7). On the other hand,
we recognize the second term and applying our main result (9) ends the derivation.

4. Main result in the case of N initial excitations

Having established the working principle of our method in the two-photon case, we
will now proceed to the most general situation where the number of incoming photons
is arbitrary and the atom is not necessarily in the ground state. Speciﬁcally, the
input state consists of N initial excitations distributed between the ﬁeld and the atom
|ψini = cg |ψNi ⊗ |gi + ce |ψN−1i ⊗ |ei.

4.1. An intuitive generalization
When decomposing in terms of Feynman diagrams, the possibility of having multiple
photons originating from atomic emissions gives rise to higher-order contributions.
These are responsible for the complexity of previous approaches which treat the atom
as a generic scatterer and require to solve the scattering problem for each of these
diagrams from scratch, recalculating the system’s response. Here lies the advantage of
our method, which is based on the physics of the atomic response and allows to bypass
calculations by capturing the system’s nonlinear response in a transparent substitution.

(a)(b)⌧⌧(a)(b)⌧⌧Indeed, our main result extends naturally to the case of N excitations

(15)

where τN > . . . > τ1 are time-ordered. This is a remarkably simple and intuitive
operational translation of the atomic nonlinearity, which allows one to derive any
quantity of interest as straightforwardly as if the atom was a linear beamsplitter.
Moreover, the fact that the scatterer could have some initial excitation before the
scattering event is nicely taken into account by the term e−τ1ˆσ−(0).

4.2. Proof of the main result in the N-excitation case
In this section we will prove the main result in the N-excitation manifold (15) by
induction based on the 2-excitation result. For the latter, in addition to (9) we also
need to consider the case where the atom is initially excited, which yields (we will
assume τi+1 > τi in the following)

h∅| ˆσ−(τ2) ˆσ−(τ1)(cid:16)|ψ1i ⊗ |ei(cid:17)
Z τ1

.

The base for our induction proof thus reads

where |2 exc.i stands for any initial state consisting of two excitations distributed
between the light ﬁeld and the atom.

Now let us assume that our result holds in the N-excitation manifold

h∅| ˆσ− (τN)··· ˆσ−(τ1)|N exc.i

= h∅| ˆσlin− (τN , τN−1)··· ˆσlin− (τ2, τ1)he−τ1ˆσ−(0) + ˆσlin− (τ1)i|N exc.i ,

(18)

and prove that this implies that our result also holds in the N + 1-excitation manifold.
This reads

h∅| ˆσ− (τN+1)··· ˆσ−(τ1)|N + 1 exc.i

= h∅| ˆσlin− (τN+1, τN)··· ˆσlin− (τ3, τ2)he−τ2ˆσ−(0) + ˆσlin− (τ2)i ˆσ−(τ1)|N + 1 exc.i

where we used the commutation relation hˆσlin− (τi+1, τi) , ˆσ−(τ1)i = 0 for any τi > τ1.

Now applying the previous result on the 2-excitation manifold (17) and rearranging the
terms concludes the proof and one ﬁnds

h∅| ˆσlin− (τN+1, τN)··· ˆσlin− (τ2, τ1)he−τ1ˆσ−(0) + ˆσlin− (τ1)i|N + 1 exc.i .

5. Solving the reﬂection of N photons

9

In order to illustrate the power of our method, we will go beyond the usual few-photon
examples addressed in the literature and tackle the reﬂection of N photons on the atom
initially in the ground state |ψini = |ψNi ⊗ |gi. For the sake of concreteness, we will
assume that these photons are all incoming from the left, such that only the wavepacket
ξN(τ1, . . . , τN) contributes to the input state (2). The most complete description of the
reﬂection event is given by the wavepacket corresponding to all the photons traveling
to the left f0(τ1, . . . , τN , t) ≡ h∅| ˆa(
N! with f0(τ1, . . . , τN , 0) = 0
at initial time.

When decomposing in terms of Feynman diagrams, it is clear that all the N photons
have to be absorbed by the atom in order to reverse their direction of propagation.
Therefore, the ﬁrst step reads

contributing Feynman diagrams to 1. From now on, let us assume τN > . . . > τ1 are
time-ordered without loss of generality. We can then apply our main result, which gives

h∅| ˆσ− (τN)··· ˆσ−(τ1)|ψini = h∅| ˆσlin− (τN , τN−1)··· ˆσlin− (τ2, τ1) ˆσlin− (τ1)|ψini

Intuitively, we are asking all the photons to be absorbed subsequently given their initial
distribution ξN(t1, . . . , tN).

As a practical example, we will consider the speciﬁc incoming light that would be
generated from the proposal [14]. There, the authors show how to use a large number
of three-level atoms in a superradiant conﬁguration as a source for deterministically
generating N-photon states in the 1D waveguide.
In the simplest case, the photons

(23)
Note that the frequency bandwidth of this mode Γ is essentially given by the
superradiant decay rate of the source and is therefore adjustable by adding or removing
atoms from the source. Since these photons are all emitted into the same mode, it is
straightforward to show using (22) that f0(τ1, . . . , τN , t) is given by a product of integrals
of the form

bandwidth Γ normalized to the atomic linewidth γ. The curves from right to left
correspond to a photon number N of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20}.

Therefore, using our method, we have obtained the probability of ﬁnding the N photons
reﬂected to the left as a function of their frequency bandwidth Γ. The result is given
in ﬁgure 4 for various N. Its qualitative features can be understood. In the limit of
large bandwidth, more and more frequency components of the pulse are oﬀ-resonant and
simply pass by the atom without interacting. This explains RN → 0 for Γ → ∞. In the
limit of very narrow bandwidth, the N-photon pulse is very long in time, thus the atom
eﬀectively responds to each photon separately; and for a single-photon at resonance,

full reﬂection is expected [9], whence RN → 1 for Γ → 0. Between these two cases, the
higher the number of photons, the faster RN drops. This is the manifestation of the fact
that the atom can absorb only one photon at a time: once one is absorbed, the others
pass through.

6. Conclusion

We have presented a novel approach for solving the scattering of N photons on a two-
level atom. At the heart of the method lies the operational translation of the atomic
nonlinear response, which allows to derive any quantity of interest in terms of the initial
wavepackets without eﬀort. Importantly, the method goes beyond the long-time limit,
giving access to quantities like the atomic excitation during the scattering event. This
is especially relevant in the context of an experiment, where one would ideally want to
fully characterize the dynamical evolution of the light ﬁeld and the atom. We have also
applied our method to a proposed protocol for reliably generating N-photon pulses in
the laboratory. An interesting perspective would be to consider the case of coherent
input light, as well as to extend the concept to a three-level atom, understanding how
this new level structure would translate at the operational level.
