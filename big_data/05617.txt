ABSTRACT

Context. Filamentary structures are common morphological features of the cold, molecular interstellar medium (ISM). Recent studies
have discovered massive, hundred-parsec-scale ﬁlaments that may be connected to the large-scale, Galactic spiral arm structure.
Addressing the nature of these Giant Molecular Filaments (GMFs) requires a census of their occurrence and properties.
Aims. We perform a systematic search of GMFs in the fourth Galactic quadrant and determine their basic physical properties.
Methods. We identify GMFs based on their dust extinction signatures in near- and mid-infrared and velocity structure probed by 13CO
line emission. We use the 13CO line emission and ATLASGAL dust emission data to estimate the total and dense gas masses of the
GMFs. We combine our sample with an earlier sample from literature and study the Galactic environment of the GMFs.
Results. We identify nine GMFs in the fourth Galactic quadrant; six are located in the Centaurus spiral arm and three in inter-arm
regions. Combining this sample with an earlier study using the same identiﬁcation criteria in the ﬁrst Galactic quadrant results in 16
GMFs, nine of which are located within spiral arms. The GMFs have sizes of 80-160 pc and 13CO-derived masses between 5−90×104
M(cid:12). Their dense gas mass fractions are between 1.5-37%, being higher in the GMFs connected to spiral arms. We also compare the
diﬀerent GMF-identiﬁcation methods and ﬁnd that emission and extinction based techniques overlap only partially, highlighting the
need to use both to achieve a complete census.

1. Introduction

Filamentary structures are present in the interstellar medium
(ISM) in a wide variety of environments, over a wide range of
scales, and they may play a major role in star formation (e.g.,
André et al. 2014). Especially, the presence of parsec-sized ﬁl-
amentary structures in the ISM and their close relationship with
star formation has been known for several decades (e.g., Schnei-
der & Elmegreen 1979; Bally et al. 1987; Beuther et al. 2011;
Hacar et al. 2013; Kainulainen et al. 2013; André et al. 2014;
Molinari et al. 2014; Stutz & Gould 2015). These ﬁlaments are
omnipresent in molecular clouds, no matter whether these clouds
are quiescent or harbour star-forming activity (e.g., Molinari
et al. 2014). Understanding the physical origin and evolution of
ﬁlaments is therefore mandatory to explain the whole process of
star formation.

The discovery of “Nessie” (Jackson et al. 2010; Goodman
et al. 2014), an 80 pc long ﬁlament associated with the Scutum-
Centaurus spiral arm, has initiated the study of a family of giant
molecular ﬁlaments (GMFs) in the Milky Way. In addition to
“Nessie”, four other GMFs had early on been discovered and
studied (Beuther et al. 2011; Kainulainen et al. 2011; Battersby
& Bally 2014; Li et al. 2013; Tackenberg et al. 2013). All these
ﬁve GMFs were identiﬁed ﬁrst as absorption features against the
mid-infrared (MIR) background of the Galaxy and conﬁrmed to
be continuous physical objects using additional spectral line in-
formation. The existence of such ﬁlaments raises the question
on whether they could be connected to the large-scale, Galac-

tic spiral arm structure. A systematic Galactic census of GMFs,
characterizing their occurrence and properties, is mandatory to
answer this question.

The ﬁrst systematic study of GMFs was carried out by Ra-
gan et al. (2014, hereafter, R14). Their study was focused on
the ﬁrst Galactic quadrant. R14 identiﬁed a series of ﬁlamen-
tary near-infrared (NIR) and MIR extinction features. They
used 13CO spectral information to search for “low-density gas
bridges” connecting the extinction features. Their goal was to
ﬁnd the longest possible extent of the gas connecting ﬁlamen-
tary structures. They found seven GMFs with lengths between
50-230 pc and masses on the order of 104-105 M(cid:12). They used the
Milky Way spiral-arm model of Vallée (2008) to investigate the
GMFs in the Galactic context. They found that, unlike “Nessie”,
most (six out of eight) of their GMFs lie in inter-arm regions,
rather than in spiral arms.

Goodman et al. (2014) suggested that “Nessie” may be a
part of a greatly longer structure that is located in the Galac-
tic midplane within a spiral arm. They called this structure a
“bone”. Using a method similar to R14, Zucker et al. (2015) re-
ported ten new “bones”. These bones are smaller and less mas-
sive than the GMFs of R14.

Recently, Wang et al. (2015) approached the census of GMFs
from a diﬀerent perspective. They used dust emission from Her-
schel to identify nine GMFs with masses and lenghts similar to
those found by R14. Generally, both ﬁlament-ﬁnding methods
do not usually identify the same ﬁlaments and, if they do so, the
size of the structures is not necesarily the same. Using a more
recent model of the spiral structure of our Galaxy (Reid et al.
2014), they found much higher coincidence between their GMFs
and spiral arms than R14 (who used the Vallée 2008, model),

with seven out of nine ﬁlaments located in Scutum-Centaurus
and Sagittarius spiral arms.

Due to the relatively low number of known GMFs and un-
certainties in the Galactic models, the relation of GMFs to the
Galactic structure remains an open question. Extending the cen-
sus of GMFs to other quadrants is key to obtain a Galaxy-wide
piture of the physical properties of the GMFs.

One key problem in identifying GMFs is that column den-
sity data (extinction or emission) alone are not suﬃcient; spec-
tral line data are needed to ascertain that the structure has a con-
tinuous velocity pattern (and hence is likely a continuous ob-
ject in three dimensions). In short, the extinction patterns must
be connected by a molecular gas tracer, usually 13CO, and ex-
hibit velocity coherence (i.e., the velocities of the ﬁlaments must
have no steep jumps, but rather show continuous velocity gra-
dients, if any). The requirement of having 13CO data greatly
hampers building a systematic census of GMFs: an unbiased
13CO survey exists only for the ﬁrst Galactic quadrant (Jack-
son et al. 2006, Galactic Ring Survey, GRS hereafter). The GRS
covered the region 17◦ ≤ l ≤ 55◦ and b ≤ |1◦|. The recent three-
mm Ultimate Mopra Milky Way Survey (Barnes et al. 2011,
2014, ThruMMS)1 presents a good opportunity to trace molecu-
lar cloud dynamics in the fourth Galactic quadrant. This ongoing
survey covers the fourth quadrant in 12CO, 13CO, C18O, and
CN.

In this paper, we extend the current census of GMFs to the
fourth Galactic quadrant. We identify the GMFs as NIR/MIR
extinction features that are connected structures in 13CO data as
probed by the ThruMMS survey. We present a sample of nine
newly identiﬁed GMFs and their physical properties. We place
the results in the Galactic context with the help of models of the
spiral-arm pattern of the Galaxy. Finally, we compare the dif-
ferent ﬁlament-ﬁnding methods to better understand their limi-
tations and complementarity with each others.

2. Data and methods
2.1. Data
2.1.1. 12CO and 13CO data
We use the 13CO(J=1–0) observations of the ThrUMMS survey
DR3 (Barnes et al. 2011, 2014) to test the velocity coherence
of the ﬁlament candidates. We also use the data to estimate the
distance to the GMFs and to obtain their total masses. This ongo-
ing survey is observing the fourth Galactic quadrant at latitudes
|b| < 1 deg in 12CO, 13CO, C18O and CN with an angular reso-
lution of 72(cid:48)(cid:48) and an approximate rms of 1.5 K km/s. ThruMMS
oﬀers full spectral coverage of the 13CO line at a spectral resolu-
tion ∼ 0.3 km/s. The observations of 12CO and 13CO are mostly
complete at |b| < 0.5◦. However, less than 25% is complete at
Galactic latitudes |b| > 0.5◦.

2.1.2. Dust continuum at 870 µm as a dense gas tracer
We employ the ATLASGAL survey (Schuller et al. 2009; Csen-
geri et al. 2014) to trace the dense gas component of the GMFs.
This survey observed cold dust emission in a large area (−80◦ ≤
l ≤ 60◦) of the Galactic plane at 870 µm, with a FWHM of 19.2 (cid:48)(cid:48)
and a rms ∼ 50 mJy/beam. Although dust emission at sub-mm
wavelengths does not generally trace only dense gas, ATLAS-
GAL ﬁlters out large scale (2.5(cid:48)) emission, thus making the ob-

servations specially sensitive to the densest gas component, gen-
erally located in the cold interior of molecular clouds.

2.1.3. Velocity data for the dense gas tracer
Unfortunately, with only ATLASGAL data, we cannot know
whether the emission arises from a GMF or from a diﬀerent
point along the line-of-sight. We need extra spectral information.
We employ several catalogs of star formation signposts to con-
ﬁrm that the dense gas is associated with the GMF. We search
for counterparts of these catalogs with ATLASGAL clumps and
compare the velocity of the sources with those of the GMFs.

We use the sources with radio recombination line counter-
parts in the WISE catalog of H ii regions (Anderson et al. 2014),
the Red MSX Survey (Lumsden et al. 2013, RMS), and the cata-
logs of NH3 (Purcell et al. 2012) and clumps H2O masers (Walsh
et al. 2011) of the HOPS survey. In addition, we use a se-
ries of follow-up studies of the ATLASGAL survey: the cata-
logs of CO depletion and isotopic ratios (Giannetti et al. 2014),
methanol massers (Urquhart et al. 2013), and massive star-
forming clumps (Urquhart et al. 2014). Further, we use the the
catalog of dense clumps from the MALT90 survey (Foster et al.
2011, 2013; Jackson et al. 2013). We list the dense gas tracers
associated to the GMFs in Table A.2.

2.2. Identifying giant molecular ﬁlaments
We identify the ﬁlament candidates following the same proce-
dure as in R14. The ﬁrst step is to identify ﬁlamentary extinc-
tion features by-eye at MIR and NIR wavelenghts in the Galac-
tic plane (see Fig. A.1–A.9). In this step, we use available data
from GLIMPSE (Benjamin et al. 2003) and 2MASS (Skrutskie
et al. 2006) surveys2, representing wide, unbiased and continu-
ous coverage of the Galactic plane at MIR and NIR wavelengths.
A group of 5 coauthors inspected the data by eye search-
ing for the extinction features. The GMF candidates must sat-
isfy two conditions: 1) the extinction features must have a pro-
jected length of (cid:38) 1◦, and 2) the group members, in pairs of two
persons, must independently conﬁrm the extinction feature as a
ﬁlament-like structure. Massive episodes of star-formation can
disrupt ﬁlaments, so we allow for gaps in the extinction struc-
tures if signs of massive star-formation are present (e.g., H ii re-
gions). We note that the PDRs surrounding H ii regions have
strong PAH emission. As a result, NIR extinction features may
coincide with emission at MIR wavelengths (e.g, 8 µm) if there
are H ii regions or strong radiation sources nearby (Draine 2011).
Following this procedure, we ﬁnd 12 GMF candidates within the
fourth Galactic quadrant. The candidates are listed in Table 1. In
the next section, we explore whether the GMF candidates are
physically connected using line emission data.

2.2.1. Velocity coherence of the candidates
To avoid projection eﬀects caused by physically unrelated
molecular clouds along the line-of-sight, we only consider the
candidates listed in Table 1 as GMFs once it is conﬁrmed that
they are velocity coherent structures. Very long ﬁlaments are
likely to show velocity gradients due to the diﬀerential rotation
of the Galaxy. These gradients depend on the location of the ﬁla-
ment in the Galaxy. For this reason, we do not restrict the veloc-

ity range of the ﬁlament candidates, but rather require them to
show continuous velocity variations, without steep jumps. The
ﬁlaments satisfying this requirement are considered velocity co-
herent.

We test

the velocity coherence of the candidates using
13CO observations of the ThrUMMS survey (see Sect. 2.1.1).
We create position-velocity (PV) diagrams for each GMF can-
didate integrating the full spectral coverage collapsed over the
whole latitude axis. In this step, we used the function sum of
python. In the cases in which the PV diagrams show a series
of diﬀerent PV-components, we create 13CO integrated intensity
maps for each component. We then compare the extinction fea-
tures with the 13CO integrated intensity maps. If they represent
a single 13CO structure, then the ﬁlament candidates are labeled
GMFs.

The following candidates are eliminated because their ex-
tinction features have no single coherent 13CO velocity compo-
nent: F354.7-349.7 and F329.3-326.5. The candidates F329.4-
327.1 and F326.7-325.8 could not be conﬁrmed because of the
lack of proper coverage in the ThrUMMS data. The remaining
nine candidates were classiﬁed as GMFs.

The spiral arms are seen as seen as a single 13CO component
with a wide-velocity range in the PV diagrams (see Fig. A.1–
A.9). If our GMFs lie inside spiral arms, then it is possible that
we are integrating over the full spiral arm, thus overestimating
the velocity range of the GMF. We do a “ﬁne tuning” of the
velocity range of the GMFs. We created position-velocity (PV)
diagrams over a line following the identiﬁed extinction features
for each candidate. This process can be done with the python
tool, Glue3. These PV diagrams are shown in the bottom panels
of Fig. A.1–A.9. We also show in Table A.1 the l–b–v tracks of
each ﬁlament.

2.2.2. Biases in the extinction-based ﬁlament ﬁnding method

We acknowledge that this method is necessarily subjective. We
make an eﬀort to reduce the subjectivity by requiring that at least
three group members agree with the ﬁlament identiﬁcation. In
addition, some GMFs that could have been potentially identiﬁed
may have been missed by our search approach.

Our ﬁlament ﬁnding method is biased towards the identiﬁ-
cation of quiescent structures (R14). Even though we allow for
gaps in ﬁlaments if they carry signs of massive star formation,
such violent episodes can disrupt molecular clouds, making them
diﬃcult (if not impossible) to be identiﬁed as GMFs.

The observation of extinction features against NIR and
MIR background requires intense background emission to have
enough contrast to identify extinction features. This is true at low
Galactic latitudes, where the star density is high, but it is not the
case at high latitudes. In general, this is not a severe issue in this
work since we target speciﬁcally the Galactic plane. However,
the region 325◦ < l < 320◦ shows low background emission
at MIR wavelengths. The identiﬁcation of extinction features in
this region is therefore more diﬃcult due to the lack of contrast
between the background and the dense foreground structures.

2.3. Estimating the total and dense molecular gas masses
2.3.1. Total molecular gas mass
To calculate the total gas mass of the ﬁlaments, we ﬁrst obtain
the column densities of 13CO. We do so following a standard
scheme in which the kinetic temperature of the 13CO, T13CO, is
assumed to be the same as that of 12CO, and equal to the ki-
netic temperature, Tk (e.g., Rohlfs & Wilson 2004). We obtain
Tk from the brightness temperature of the optically thick line
12CO, TB,12CO,

Tk =

with TB,12CO obtained from the peak of the 12CO emission. The
optical depth of the 13CO line, τ13CO, is obtained via

tain the total column density of 13CO

For consistency with R14, we convert N13CO into 12CO col-
umn densities, N12CO, using a 12CO/13CO ratio that varies
with galactocentric distance following the linear
relation
12CO/13CO = 5.41Rgal[kpc] + 19.3 (Milam et al. 2005). The
galactocentric distances of the ﬁlaments are listed in Table. 2.
Finally, the 12CO column densities are converted into column
densities of molecular gas following: N12CO/N(H2) = 1.1 × 10−4
(Pineda et al. 2010). We ﬁnd that 13CO integrated intensities of
1.5 K / km/s correspond to N(H2) ∼ 1.3 × 1021 cm−2.

where mH2 is the mass of the molecular hydrogen, Npix and Apix
the number and area of the pixels inside the GMF respectively,
and d the distance to the GMF (See Sect. 3.1.1).

Finally, we obtain the total molecular gas mass of the GMFs

2.3.2. Dense gas mass
We used the ATLASGAL data to estimate the dense gas mass of
the GMFs. We required the ATLASGAL emission to be detected
at 5σ (250 mJy/beam) for consistency with R14. This emission
is equivalent to N(H2) = 7 × 1021 cm−2. We estimate the dense
gas mass of each GMF via

Mdense =

Rd2F870µm

B870µm(Tdust)κ

,

(5)

where F870µm is the ATLASGAL ﬂux, d is the distance to the ﬁl-
ament, and B870µm(Tdust) is the blackbody radiation at 870 µm as
a function of temperature, Tdust, which we assume Tdust = 20 K.
R = 150 is the gas-to-dust ratio (Draine 2011). We used a dust
absorption coeﬃcient κ = 1.42 cm2g−1 at 870 µm, extrapolated
from the dust model of Ossenkopf & Henning (1994) for dust
grains with thin ice mantles and a mean density of n ∼ 105 cm−3.
It is possible that the ATLASGAL emission along the line-
of-sight of a ﬁlament is not related to the GMF, but rather with
molecular clouds at diﬀerent distances. To avoid this line-of-
sight confusion we use spectral information of the star-forming
signposts introduced in Sect. 2.1.3. If any of these signposts is
associated to an ATLASGAL clump in projection and its vLSR
lies inside the velocity range of the GMF, then we assume that
this ATLASGAL clump is part of the GMF. If we found no star-
forming signposts in an ATLASGAL clump, we also assume it
to be part of the GMF. If the vLSR of the signposts associated
with ATLASGAL emission is outside the range of velocities of
the GMF, then the associated ATLASGAL clumps are neglected.

3. Results
3.1. Physical properties of the GMFs
In this section we present physical properties of the GMFs:
length, velocity gradient, total mass, dense gas mass, and dense
gas mass fraction.

3.1.1. Kinematic distance, length and velocity gradient
Before obtaining the mass and length of the GMFs, we estimate
their kinematic distances using 13CO data. We ﬁt the spectrum
of each GMF with a Gaussian and deﬁne the vLSR as the cen-
troid of the ﬁt. We used the model of the Galactic spiral arm
pattern by Reid et al. (2014) to convert vLSR into kinematic dis-
tances, assuming the standard Galactic parameters. Our ﬁlament-
ﬁnding method favors identiﬁcation of nearby ﬁlaments. Al-
though infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) can be seen against the
MIR background at both sides of the Galaxy, only those in
the near side would appear as clear extinction features at NIR
wavelengths (Kainulainen et al. 2011). Our extinction method is
therefore limited to ﬁnd ﬁlaments up to ∼8 kpc distance (Kainu-
lainen et al. 2011). We therefore assumed the near kinematic dis-
tances to our GMFs. The velocities and distances to the GMFs
are listed in Table 2. We ﬁnd distances between 2.2–3.7 kpc.
These are similar to previously identiﬁed GMFs. For comparison
with the kinematic distances, we also list in Table 2 the distances
derived from dust extinction (Marshall et al. 2009). We estimated
the mean extinction distance to the GMFs as the average of every
counterpart in Marshall et al. (2009) associated to the GMFs and
assume their standard deviation as the uncertainty. In general we
obtain larger distances using this method. This is consistent with
a systematic oﬀset of 1.5 kpc between kinematic and extinction
derived distances, already reported in Marshall et al. (2009).

Article number, page 4 of 31

We estimate the angular length of the GMFs using a line
that follows the extinction and emission features at 8 µm from
end to end of the signiﬁcant 13CO emission (≥1.5 K km/s) of
each ﬁlament (see Fig. A.1–A.9). The signiﬁcant emission is
estimated measuring the noise of the CO integrated intensity
maps. We ﬁnd angular lengths between 1◦ and 3◦. The angular
length is converted into physical length using the distances pre-
viously estimated. No corrections are applied for the projection
eﬀects. These lengths are therefore lower limits. We found GMF
projected lengths between 40–170 pc, with a mean of ∼100 pc.
These values are similar to the ﬁlaments identiﬁed by R14.

We estimate the projected velocity gradient of the GMFs as
∇v = (vini-vend)/l, where vini and vend are the velocity centroids at
both ends of the GMF and l is the projected length of the GMF.
Most of the GMFs exhibit projected velocity gradients through-
out their extent, except the GMF 324.5-321.4, that shows no pro-
jected velocity gradient over its 120 pc size. We found projected
velocity gradients between 0–120 km/s kpc−1 (see Table 2). We
emphasize that these velocity gradients are projected. We did not
correct them from projection eﬀects. Therefore, these gradients
oﬀer a pure observational measure and should not be directly
connected to velocity gradients introduced by Galactic rotation
or shear motions.

3.1.2. Dense gas mass fraction (DGMF)

We estimate the total molecular gas mass and the dense gas mass
of the GMFs following the procedures described in Sect. 2.3.1
and Sect. 2.3.2. We obtain total molecular cloud masses in the
range of [1.4, 9.4]×105 M(cid:12). We found dense gas masses between
[2.1, 310] × 103 M(cid:12).

We calculate the dense gas mass fraction (DGMF) of the
GMFs as the ratio of the dense to total molecular gas masses
of the GMFs. This quantity has been recently connected to the
star-forming rate of molecular clouds (Heiderman et al. 2010;
Lada et al. 2010, 2012; Abreu-Vicente et al. 2015). In general,
we ﬁnd DGMFs between 1.5% and 15%. However, the ﬁlament
GMF 335.6-333.6 shows a larger DGMF, 37%. This large value
is related to the massive H ii complex G333, from which most
of the ATLASGAL emission of the GMF arises (see Fig A.5).
The DGMF of this ﬁlament agrees with values found in massive
(≥ 105 M(cid:12)) H ii regions in the Galactic plane (Abreu-Vicente
et al. 2015). The lower DGMF values found in the other ﬁla-
ments are consistent with those found in the GMF sample of R14
and other large molecular ﬁlaments (Battersby & Bally 2014;
Kainulainen et al. 2013). These values are also characteristic for
local star-forming clouds (Kainulainen et al. 2009; Lada et al.
2010, 2012) and high-mass star-forming clumps (Johnston et al.
2009; Battisti & Heyer 2014).

The main uncertainty in our dense gas mass estimates is
the distance to the ﬁlaments. This is also the case for the total
gas mass. Unfortunately, the ThruMMS data has a non-uniform
noise coverage that may lead to lose signiﬁcant 13CO emission
in some of our GMFs, limiting our ability to measure their total
gas mass. In addition, ﬁve of the GMFs are only partly covered
by the ThruMMS data. As a consequence of these issues, we can
only measure lower limits of the actual total gas mass in most of
our GMFs, resulting in upper limits for the DGMFs. These are
indicated in Table 3. We also show these regions in Fig. A.1–A.9.

3.2. Giant molecular ﬁlaments in the Galaxy

What is the role of the GMFs in the Galactic spiral structure?
Do they belong to the spiral arms or to inter-arm regions? We
explore the answer to these questions in Fig. 1, in which we show
the vLSR of the three inner spiral arms in the fourth quadrant as
function of their galactic longitude following Reid et al. (2014).
For simplicity, since our ﬁlament ﬁnding method is more likely
to reveal ﬁlaments in the near side of the Galaxy (Sect. 3.1.1),
we only show the near distance solutions of the spiral arms. We
measure the velocities at the ends of the ﬁlaments and plot them
in Fig. 1. We ﬁnd that six out of nine of our GMFs are connected
to the Centaurus spiral arm, while three GMFs lie in inter-arm
regions.

We also re-examine the locations of the GMFs identiﬁed by
R14 using the Reid et al. (2014) model. We ﬁnd that three out
of their seven GMFs are connected to spiral arms (see Fig. 1),
two of them to the Sagittarius arm and a third one to the Scutum

arm. If we put together the GMF samples of R14 and this work
we ﬁnd that nine out of 16 GMFs are related to spiral arms. The
percentage of spiral arm ﬁlaments higher in the fourth quadrant
(67%) than in the ﬁrst (<50%). In the ﬁrst quadrant the GMFs
are associated to the Sagittarius and Scutum arms, while in the
fourth quadrant they are preferentially connected to the Centau-
rus arm.

The higher fraction of spiral arm ﬁlaments found by us com-
pared to R14 is aﬀected by our use of the Reid et al. (2014)
model instead of the Vallée (2008) model. One of the main dif-
ferences between Vallée (2008) and (Reid et al. 2014) is that the
latter compare their model with typical spiral arm tracers such as
H ii regions or massers while this step is not done in the former
work. The velocities of the Sagittarius arm, the closest spiral arm
in the ﬁrst quadrant, are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in Vallée (2008)
and (Reid et al. 2014) models.

Now we study the relative orientations of the GMFs com-
pared to the spiral arms. Here we analyze together the GMF
samples of this work and R14. Figure 2 shows that there are
seven GMFs connected to the Scutum-Centaurus arm, two to the
Sagittarius arm and there are seven GMFs located in inter-arm
regions. Four of the GMFs connected to spiral arms in Fig. 2 are
connected only by one of their ends. We now address whether
the uncertainties are large enough to place part of a ﬁlament in
an inter-arm region even if it lies within a spiral arm.

There are three main sources of error that play a role in the
location of the ﬁlaments: the spiral arm width, the velocity reso-
lution of the 13CO spectra, and the uncertainty in the kinematic
distance. The latter is by far the most important. The distance
uncertainties of our GMFs, obtained from the Reid et al. (2014)
model, range between [0.7–0.3] kpc (see Table. 2). These un-
certainties are larger than the widths of the Scutum-Centaurus
and Sagittarius spiral arms, 0.17 kpc and 0.26 kpc respectively,
in the Reid et al. (2014) model. The estimates of the exact loca-
tion of the ﬁlaments, based on these kinetic distances alone, are
not enough to claim are not enough to claim that the GMFs are
located in spiral arms, inter-arm regions or connect both.
We now complement this study with PV diagrams of the
12CO emission, integrated between |b| ≤ 1◦. If a GMF lies in-
side a spiral arm, its velocity should be consistent with that of
the spiral arm. A spiral arm appears in a PV diagram as a strong
single component. We overlay a line showing the velocity of the
GMF as function of its Galactic longitude on the PV diagram.
If this line falls completely inside 12CO emission of any spiral
arm, we could say that the GMF is completely within it. If it
falls outside, we can conﬁrm that the GMF is located in an inter-
arm region. We show the results of this experiment in the bottom
panels of Fig. A.1–A.9. These ﬁgures conﬁrm that every GMF
connected to a spiral arm in Fig. 2 has velocities consistent with
the arm over its whole extent. These data oﬀer no support for
the hypothesis that some of the GMFs could be a “spur” (i.e., a
ﬁlament connecting spiral-arms with inter-arm regions observed
in external galaxies.) Similarly, the inter-arm GMFs show veloc-
ities not consistent with the spiral arms. We note that the spiral
arm positions of some of our GMFs are independently conﬁrmed
by previous works, focused on particular H ii regions or IRDCs
within them (see App. A).

4. Discussion

4.1. Comparing large-scale ﬁlament ﬁnding methods

Three methods have been used so far to systematically search
for tens-of-parsec scale ﬁlaments. Two of them, based on iden-
tiﬁcation of the ﬁlaments as extinction features against the
MIR/NIR background of the Galactic plane, have been used by
R14, Zucker et al. (2015), and this work. In this work and in
R14 we look for the largest ﬁlamentary structures in the Milky
Way, irrespective of their relative orientation with respect to the
galactic midplane or spiral arms. The ﬁlaments revealed by both
works are known as GMFs. Instead, Zucker et al. (2015) search
explicitly for “Nessie” analogues (i.e., ﬁlaments within spi-
ral arms and parallel to the Galactic midplane). They refer to
these ﬁlaments “bones”. The third method identiﬁes the ﬁla-
ments as extended emission features at far-infrared (FIR) wave-
lengths using Herschel data (Wang et al. 2015). We will refer to
these as “emission-identiﬁed ﬁlaments”. In principle, this nam-
ing scheme does not imply that the physical properties of the
objects are diﬀerent, nor that they should be called diﬀerently.

and Sagittarius-Carina (red) spiral arms as function of galactic longi-

is equivalent to the spatial width of the ﬁlaments from (Reid et al. 2014).
For simplicity, we only show the near kinetic distances of the spiral
arms. Each line segment represents a GMF, taking the vLSR values from
the ends of the ﬁlaments. The line segments ended with black circles
show GMFs of our sample while those with white stars belong to R14.
We also show “Nessie”, with a red line ended in red circles.

ing the Reid et al. (2014) model. We show the Norma (cyan), Scutum-

(Gray) spiral arms. The width of the spiral arms shows the width esti-
mated by Reid et al. (2014). The circled GC represents the Galactic Cen-
ter and (cid:12) represents the Sun. The black lines represent the GMF samples
of this work (at negative X values) and R14 (at positive X values). The
red lines show the ﬁlament sample from Wang et al. (2015), based on
Herchel emission data. The green line shows “Nessie” (Jackson et al.
2010; Goodman et al. 2014). The blue lines represent other previously
known ﬁlaments (Beuther et al. 2011; Battersby & Bally 2014; Li et al.
2013).

We compare ﬁrst the GMFs and the bones. In the galac-
tic plane areas covered by Zucker et al. (2015), R14, and this
work there are nine bones, including “Nessie”, and 16 GMFs,
seven from R14 and nine from this paper. At ﬁrst look, the bones
should be a sub-group of the GMFs in which only GMFs (or
sub regions within them) parallel to the Galactic mid-plane and

inside spiral arms would be identiﬁed as bones. However, only
three bones correspond to our GMFs. The ﬁlaments 10, 8 and
5 in Zucker et al. (2015) are sub-regions of the GMF 335.6-
333.6, GMF 358.9-357.4, and GMF 20-17.9, respectively. The
main reasons why only three out of nine bones of Zucker et al.
(2015) overlap with the GMFs is because these bones have angu-
lar lengths clearly below 1◦, which is one of our GMF require-
ments. This property makes the bones and GMFs not directly
comparable to each other.

We now compare the extinction and emission-identiﬁed ﬁla-
ments. Only three out of nine emission ﬁlaments in Wang et al.
(2015) have also been identiﬁed in extinction. These ﬁlaments,
labeled in Wang et al. (2015) as G339, G11, and G26, corre-
spond respectively to “Nessie”, the ﬁlament 6 in Zucker et al.
(2015), and the GMF 26.7-25.4 in R14. The emission-identiﬁed
ﬁlaments can be missed as extinction ﬁlaments because of lack
of contrast between the ﬁlament and the MIR/NIR background.
On the other hand, extinction ﬁlaments may not be identiﬁed
in emission due to background and foreground confusion along
the line-of-sight. Despite these diﬀerences both methods are
likely to reveal quiescent structures in the early stages of star-
formation. We conclude that the extinction and emission ﬁla-
ment ﬁnding methods compliment each other well, ﬁnding ﬁla-
ments that can only be identiﬁed using one of both methods.

Do the physical properties of the ﬁlaments identiﬁed with
the three diﬀerent techniques agree? The bones have lengths be-
tween 13 pc and 52 pc and are the smallest of the three samples.
The lengths of the emission-identiﬁed ﬁlaments (37–99 pc) are
comparable to those of the GMFs (see Table 2). The bones have
the lowest masses (M ≤ 103 M(cid:12)), followed by the emission-
identiﬁed ﬁlaments, M = [0.5 − 8.3] × 104 M(cid:12), and with the
GMFs being the most massive large-scale ﬁlaments (see Ta-
ble 3). The masses of the emission-identiﬁed ﬁlaments and the
bones are comparable to the dense gas masses of the GMFs. This
is a selection eﬀect. The masses of the bones are obtained over
an area equivalent to the extinction feature and not over the full
13CO emission as it is the case for our GMFs5. The similarity
between the masses of the emission-identiﬁed ﬁlaments and the
dense gas mass of the GMFs is a consequence of the dense gas
material traced by the FIR continuum at 350 µm and 500 µm. The
area covered by this emission is limited to dense regions that are
surrounded by more diﬀuse 13CO emission. The masses of the
emission ﬁlaments and bones are therefore comparable only to
the dense gas mass of the GMFs rather than to the total mass.

The direct comparison of the physical properties of the dif-
ferent kind of large ﬁlaments found so far is not straightforward.
Each of the techniques used so far measures the ﬁlament proper-
ties on its on way. We encourage the use of the technique used in
this paper to obtain the bulk properties of long ﬁlaments in the
future, so that they can be compared to the existing sample.

Do these ﬁlament techniques preferentially ﬁnd spiral- or
inter-arm ﬁlaments? In this discussion we do not include the
bones since they lie within spiral arms by deﬁnition. Seven
out of nine (78%) emission-identiﬁed ﬁlaments lie in spiral
arms (Wang et al. 2015), as shown with the red ﬁlaments of
Fig. 2. This percentage is lower for the extinction ﬁlaments (11
out of 18, 61%). Although the percentage of spiral arm emission-
identiﬁed ﬁlaments is larger than that of extinction ﬁlaments, we
acknowledge that with the small number of statistics we have
this diﬀerent may not be signiﬁcant.

5 Not to mention that they are generally smaller than the GMFs and
the emission-identiﬁed ﬁlaments

4.2. Dense gas mass fraction and its variation with the

ﬁlament location

R14 found a tentative anti-correlation between the DGMF of the
ﬁlaments and their distance to the Galactic midplane. They also
found that the ﬁlament with highest DGMF in their sample was
located in a spiral arm. This is also the case of the large-scale
ﬁlament with the highest DGMF known to date, “Nessie”, with
a DGMF∼ 50% (Goodman et al. 2014). However, we note that
the dense gas mass estimates in Goodman et al. (2014) are made
using HCN and not using sub-mm dust emission as in R14 or
this work. The results of R14 have however poor statistics due
to the low number of GMFs in their sample. We explore this
relationship further with our extended GMF sample.
The GMFs lie preferentially above the physical galactic mid-
plane, which is located at about b = −0.35◦ in the fourth quad-
rant. In Fig. 3 we show the relationship between the height above
the galactic plane, z, and the DGMFs of the GMF samples of this
work, R14, Battersby & Bally (2014) and “Nessie”. It shows
no correlation at all between z and the DGMFs. The two ﬁla-
ments with the largest DGMFs lie close to the galactic midplane.
However, the scatter in the DGMFs at any z, and particularly at
z < 10 pc, is also very high. We therefore conclude that there is
no evidence for correlation between the height above the galactic
plane and the DGMF of the ﬁlaments. However, in this work we
only cover z scales of a few tens of parsecs, while we are able to
study kilo-parsec scales along the line of sight. We cannot rule
out the possibility of a DGMF-z relation at larger scales.

Another interesting points to look at are the diﬀerence in the
DGMFs of spiral arm ﬁlaments and inter-arm ﬁlaments and the
diﬀerence in DGMFs within diﬀerent spiral arms. We found that
the DGMF of the GMFs that belong to the Scuttum-Crux arm
is 13.0 ± 10.1 %, while that of the GMFs in the Sagittarius arm
is 2.1 ± 0.5 %, where the uncertainties are the standard devia-
tion of the mean DGMFs. However, only two GMFs lie in the
Sagittarius arm, generating a very poor statistical sample. Now
we compare the DGMFs of arm and inter-arm GMFs. We esti-
mate the mean DGMFs for every giant ﬁlament (GMF or emis-

sion) with DGMF estimates. We ﬁnd that the mean DGMF in
spiral arm ﬁlaments is 14.3 ± 15.5 % while this value is lower in
the inter-arm ﬁlaments, 4.8 ± 1.7 %. We note the big scatter in
the DGMF of the spiral arm ﬁlaments, due mainly to “Nessie”
and GMF 335.6-333.6, with DGMFs of 50% and 37% respec-
tively. We performed an independent-samples t-test to compare
the DGMFs of spiral- and inter-arm GMFs. We used the task
ttest-ind from the package scipy in Python. This task re-
turns the t-value and also a p-value6 that is an indication on the
signiﬁcance of the means. We found a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in
the DGMFs of spiral-arm (14.3 ± 15.5 %) and inter-arm GMFS
(4.8± 1.7 %), with t=2.02 and p=0.07. We can therefore assume
that the mean DGMF of the spiral arm GMFs is higher than that
of the inter-arm ﬁlaments. This is in agreement with observations
in external galaxies, where the amount of dense gas is larger in
the spiral arms than in inter-arm regions (Hughes et al. 2013;
Schinnerer et al. 2013). The connection between the DGMF and
the star-forming activity of molecular clouds (Kainulainen et al.
2009; Lada et al. 2010, 2012; Abreu-Vicente et al. 2015) and
this result suggest that the spiral arm ﬁlaments have larger star-
forming potential than the inter-arm ﬁlaments. In other words,
the star-forming activity of the GMFs depend on its Galactic lo-
cation with respect to the spiral arms.

The masses of our GMFs, and also those of R14, are consis-
tent with the deﬁnition of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Stark
& Lee (2006) found, using a sample of 56 GMCs (deﬁned by
them as molecular clouds with M > 105 M(cid:12)), that all GMCs
were related to spiral arms. Only a 10% of less massive clouds
were found to be unrelated to spiral arms. Following the GMC
deﬁnition of Stark & Lee (2006), we found that ﬁve out of 14
GMFs consistent with GMC masses are in inter-arm regions.
We therefore ﬁnd that most of the GMCs in the Galaxy are re-
lated to spiral arms, as it was found by (Dame et al. 1986). Al-
though the GMC population is enhanced in the spiral arms, the
star-forming activity is not signiﬁcantly enhanced on them (Eden
et al. 2012, 2013; Moore et al. 2012). Our results agree with a
picture on which a non-negligible amount GMCs can be found
outside spiral arms, as also seen in external galaxies (Schinnerer
et al. 2013). Also in external galaxies, Foyle et al. (2010) have
reported signiﬁcant star-forming activity in inter-arm regions.

5. Conclusions
We have used the 2MASS, GLIMPSE, and ThruMMS surveys
to extend the GMF catalog initiated in R14 to the fourth Galac-
tic quadrant. We inspected visually the NIR/MIR images to look
for ﬁlamentary extinction features of at least one degree in an-
gular length. We then used spectral 13CO information from the
ThruMMS survey to conﬁrm that those features are continuous
in velocity.
– We present a sample of nine newly identiﬁed GMFs. The
projected lengths of the new GMFs range from 38 pc to
168 pc. Total masses as traced by 13CO are between 4 ×
104 M(cid:12) and 9.4 × 105 M(cid:12). We also used the cold dust emis-
sion at 870 µm to estimate the dense gas mass of the GMFs
and found that it ranges from 2.1 × 103 M(cid:12) to 3.1 × 105 M(cid:12).
– The ratio of the dense and total gas masses is the DGMF,
which ranges between 1.5% and 37%. The largest is related
with the H ii complex G333 in the GMF 335.6-333.6. This
value agrees with the DGMFs of massive (>105 M(cid:12)) molec-
ular clouds with H ii regions found in Abreu-Vicente et al.

If the p-value returned by ttest-ind is lower than 0.10, then both

6
means are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.

Article number, page 8 of 31

(2015). The other values, between 1.5% and 15%, are consis-
tent with typical DGMFs found in molecular clouds (Battisti
& Heyer 2014; Abreu-Vicente et al. 2015).

– We explored the role of the GMFs identiﬁed by us and R14 in
the Galactic context. Adopting the Reid et al. (2014) Galactic
model, we ﬁnd that nine out of 16 GMFs are connected to
spiral arms. Seven out of these nine ﬁlaments are connected
to the Scutum-Centaurus arm and two to the Sagittarius arm.
Three GMFs of R14 are related to spiral arms when the Reid
et al. (2014) model is used, while only one is if Vallée (2008)
model is used.

– We ﬁnd no correlation between the DGMFs of GMFs and the
distance from the Galactic midplane. This result disagrees
with the tentative correlation found by R14. However, we
note that we only observed GMFs within a few tens of par-
secs of the Galactic midplane. We found that the DGMFs
of the spiral arm GMFs are larger than those of the inter-
arm GMFs. This result agrees with observations of exter-
nal galaxies showing that the DGMFs of molecular clouds
within spiral arms have larger DGMFs than inter-arm clouds
(Hughes et al. 2013; Schinnerer et al. 2013). The DGMF
has a direct relationship with the star-forming activity (Kain-
ulainen et al. 2009; Lada et al. 2012). This result there-
fore suggests that the star-forming potential of the GMFs is
tightly connected to their relative position to the Galactic spi-
ral arms.

– We compared the diﬀerent methods used to date to iden-
tify large ﬁlaments: ﬁlaments identiﬁed as extinction features
(GMFs and bones) and emission-identiﬁed ﬁlaments. The
GMFs and the emission-identiﬁed ﬁlaments have compara-
ble sizes and are generally larger than the bones. The total
masses of the bones and the emission ﬁlaments are compara-
ble to the dense gas masses of our GMF sample. This result
is an observational eﬀect since both, bones and emission ﬁl-
aments, search preferentially dense gas. Emission ﬁlaments
are more preferentially connected to the spiral arms than our
GMFs. Due to the diﬀerent biases of the extinction and emis-
sion ﬁlament ﬁnding methods, each method can identify ﬁl-
aments that are missed by the other.

Appendix A: Notes on individual GMFs

Appendix A.1: GMF 307.2-305.4

The GMF 307.2-305.4 can be identiﬁed as a mixture of emission
and extinction features (see Fig. A.1). This ﬁlament shows the
widest velocity range of the sample [-29,-39] km/s. This wide
velocity spread can be caused by the location of the ﬁlament,
close to the tangent point (see also Fig. 2), or by the expanding
bubble generated by the massive G305 H ii complex (Hindson
et al. 2010; Davies et al. 2012), that can be identiﬁed as emission
in the 8 µm image. This H iiregion has a molecular gas mass of
∼ 6×105(cid:12) (Hindson et al. 2010). We ﬁnd several dense gas clumps
in this complex that have velocities consistent with the GMF.
GMF 307.2-305.4 lies within the Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm.
This is consistent with previous works that relate G 305 to the
Scutum-Centaurus arm (Hindson et al. 2010; Davies et al. 2012).

Appendix A.2: GMF 309.5-308.7

The only GMF aligned perpendicularly to the Galactic plane, it
can be seen at 8 µm as a vertical extinction feature connecting a
series of strong emitting regions, known to be regions of massive
star-forming activity: RCW79 (Saito et al. 2001; Russeil 2003;
Zavagno et al. 2006) in the north, and Gum 48d (Karr et al. 2009)
in the south, the latter connected to the Scutum-Centaurus arm.
Previous distance estimates of these H ii regions agree with those
found in this paper. Some supernova remnants are found within
GMF 309.5-308.7 and close to it at lower longitudes, conﬁrm-
ing the very active recent massive star-forming activity in the re-
gion. Unfortunately, ThruMMS does not fully cover the ﬁlament.
The southern region has not been observed in either 12CO or
13CO (see red boxes in Fig. A.2). The total molecular mass of
the GMF is therefore a lower limit.

Appendix A.3: GMF 319.0-318.7

We identiﬁed the GMF as an extinction feature connecting two
star-forming sites. However, a close look to the GMF presents it
as two dense ﬁlaments, both following extinction features con-
nected by a diﬀuse envelope (see Fig. A.3). This GMF is located
within the predicted Scutum-Centaurus arm.

Appendix A.4: GMF 324.5-321.4

is

the

extinction feature

IRDC
The most prominent
321.71+0.07 (Vasyunina et al. 2009), located at a distance
of 2.14kpc. The red box in the bottom-left corner of Fig. A.4
shows that there is no ThruMMS coverage of that area. The
red box in the middle of the ﬁlament shows a region with
very high noise. In this region the east and west ends of GMF
324.5-321.4 are barely connected. Although the 12CO map
shows a clear connection between both parts of the ﬁlament,
we proceed with caution, dividing this GMF in two possible
ﬁlaments: the whole ﬁlament from l = 321.5 ◦ to l = 324.5 ◦,
and a shorter version from l = 321.5 ◦ to l = 322.5 ◦ called GMF
324.5-321.4b. All the dense gas mass of this ﬁlament is located
in IRDC 321.71+0.07, so that the DGMF of GMF 324.5-321.4b
is considerably larger than that of the longer GMF 324.5-321.4.
This is the only ﬁlament showing no velocity gradient along it.
GMF 324.5-321.4 and GMF 324.5-321.4b are not connected to
any spiral arm.

Appendix A.5: GMF 335.6-333.6

It harbors one of the best studied H ii regions in the south-
ern Galactic hemisphere, G333 or RCW106 (Mookerjea et al.
2004; Roman-Lopes et al. 2009). This H ii region is located at
3.6 kpc (in agreement with the distance to our GMF), it has a
size of 30×90 pc and a mass of ∼ 2.7 × 105(cid:12) (Bains et al. 2006).
GMF 335.6-333.6 is seen as an extinction feature connected to

RCW106. The RCW106 complex is the main cause of the re-
markably high DGMF (∼ 37%) measured in GMF 335.6-333.6a.
The end at higher galactic longitudes is connected to the S40
bubble. There is a small region of the GMF that is not covered
by ThruMMS, as it is shown with the red box in Fig. A.5. This
GMF lies in the Scutum-Centaurus arm.

Appendix A.6: GMF 335.6-333.6b

This ﬁlament is very close to GMF 335.6-333.6a and it is rec-
ognizable as a prominent extinction feature connecting two star-
forming sites. It also has velocity close to that of GMF 335.6-
333.6. Although in the ﬁrst step we included GMF 335.6-333.6b
as part of GMF 335.6-333.6, we ﬁnally divided them for two
reasons: ﬁrst, because they are not connected in 13CO, and sec-
ond because their velocities slightly diﬀer. GMF 335.6-333.6b
has also been identiﬁed as a Milky Way bone (see Sect. 4.1)
by Zucker et al. (2015). GMF 335.6-333.6b lies in the Scutum-
Centaurus arm.

This ﬁlament seem to be part of “Nessie extended” (Good-
man et al. 2014). However, GMF 341.9-337.1 does not lie in
the Scutum-Centaurus arm, as “Nessie extended” does, but
rather in an inter-arm region (see Fig. A.7). We explore the rea-
sons of this discrepancy below. Figure A.7 shows that the emis-
sion of the Scutum-Centaurus arm has velocities of about [-35,-
25] km/s, while the velocities of GMF 341.9-337.1 are lower,
[-48,-43] km/s. This fact raises the question on whether GMF
341.9-337.1 is connected to “Nessie extended”.

Appendix A.7: GMF 341.9-337.1

GMF 341.9-337.1 has a H ii region in its low-longitude end and
another one, much more compact, in the middle. An extinction
feature connects both star-forming sites and extends towards in-
creasing longitudes. The southern part of the ﬁlament is not com-
pletely covered by ThruMMS (see the red boxes in Fig. A.7). As
shown in Fig. A.7, almost every ATLASGAL clump in this ﬁla-
ment has additional kinematic information conﬁrming the loca-
tion of the dense gas inside GMF 341.9-337.1.

We integrated the 13CO emission over the expected velocity
range of “Nessie extended” to investigate whether it overlaps
with GMF 341.9-337.1. In Fig. A.7 we show that both ﬁlaments
overlap each other. However, there are extinction features that
are only covered by GMF 341.9-337.1 and we also ﬁnd that most
of the star-forming sites known are connected to GMF 341.9-
337.1 rather than to “Nessie extended”. We conclude that there
are overlapping extinction features in this region, better matched
by GMF 341.9-337.1. This ﬁlament lies in an inter-arm region.

Appendix A.8: GMF 343.2-341.7
Two extinction features separated by a H ii region in projection.
The high longitude end of the GMF is connected to another
smaller H ii region. The signiﬁcant 13CO emission of this ﬁla-
ment shows two separated objects, although they are connected
by signiﬁcant 12CO emission. We note that there are high noise
features in the ThruMMS data exactly in those 13CO empty re-
gions that could hide a signiﬁcant connection between the two
parts of the 13CO ﬁlament (red boxes in Fig. A.8). The high lon-
gitude section of the ﬁlament shows no dense gas, nor dense
clumps connected to GMF 343.2-341.7. The GMF is not con-
nected to any spiral arm, as it is shown in the bottom panel of
Fig. A.8.

Appendix A.9: GMF 358.9-357.4
It lies in a very crowded region. Every spiral arm at these Galac-
tic latitudes has velocities close to 0 km/s. This makes it diﬃ-
cult to isolate single velocity components. The most prominent
extinction feature in GMF 358.9-357.4 is the IRDC known as
G357 (Marshall et al. 2009). After isolating its velocity compo-
nent we found that it lies inside a much larger 13CO complex.
The distance estimates in this region are particularly hard to ob-
tain using the Reid et al. (2014) model. We therefore rejected this
model for this ﬁlament and instead used the distances from the
literature: 3.3 kpc (Marshall et al. 2009). This distance estimate
places GMF 358.9-357.4 in the Scuttum-Crux arm.
