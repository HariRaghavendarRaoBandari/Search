ABSTRACT
We report the results of the deepest Galactic Plane (|b| < 17.5◦) survey in the 67.9 and
78.4 keV nuclear de-excitation lines of titanium-44 (44Ti) performed using the data
acquired with the IBIS/ISGRI instrument onboard the INTEGRAL satellite during
12 years of operation. The peak sensitivity of our survey reached an unprecedented
level of 4.8 × 10−6 ph cm−2 s−1 (3σ) that improves the sensitivity of the survey done
by CGRO/COMPTEL by a factor of ∼ 5. As a result, constraining upper limits for
all sources from the catalog of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs; Green 2014) are
derived. These upper limits can be used to estimate the exposure needed to detect
44Ti emission from any known SNR using existing and prospective X- and gamma-ray
telescopes. Among the youngest Galactic SNRs, only Cas A shows signiﬁcant 44Ti
emission ﬂux in good agreement with the NuSTAR measurements. We did not detect
any other sources of titanium emission in the Galactic Plane at signiﬁcance level higher
than 5σ conﬁrming previous claims of the rarity of such 44Ti-producing SNRs.

INTRODUCTION

Supernova (SN) explosions determine the chemical and
physical evolution of the Universe. An understanding of their
mechanism is the keystone of many branches of the modern
astrophysics. However, there is no way to observe directly
physical processes during the ﬁrst stages of the explosion
due to a very high opacity. The most promising solution of
this problem is to measure the amount of radioactive ele-
ments synthesised during SN explosion and based on that
to verify the existing models (see, e.g., Vink 2012).

Probably the best candidate to such explosion tracer is
radioactive isotope of titanium-44 (44Ti). It has a lifetime
of about 85 years (e.g., Ahmad et al. 2006), that is long
enough to guarantee the substantial fraction of the synthe-
sised titanium to remain active after the envelope become
transparent. Such lifetime is much shorter than for, e.g., 26Al
(τ ∼ 106 yr), that permits to associate the measured ﬂux

with a speciﬁc supernova remnant (SNR), thus increasing
chances to detect young (few hundred years) SNR.

44Ti is produced during SN explosions deep inside the
progenitor star and its yield is very sensitive to the par-
ticular conditions there. Mainly it is synthesised during core
collapse SN within an α-rich freeze-out, and, hence, depends
strongly on the expansion speed of the inner layers of the
ejecta (Arnett 1996; Magkotsios et al. 2010). Other factors
aﬀecting yield of 44Ti are the mass cut between the proto-
neutron star and the ejecta, progenitor mass and metallic-
ity, explosion asymmetry (Nagataki et al. 1998). Core col-
lapse SNe produce typically 10−5–10−4 M⊙ of titanium (e.g.
Timmes et al. 1996). The expected yield of 44Ti in type Ia
SNe is ranging from ∼ 10−6 M⊙ for a centrally ignited pure-
deﬂagration to ∼ 6 × 10−5 M⊙ for an oﬀ-center delayed
detonation (Iwamoto et al. 1999; Maeda et al. 2010). How-
ever, in the so-called double-detonation sub-Chandrasekhar
model it can reach ∼ 10−3 M⊙ (Fink et al. 2010).

From the observational point of view the signatures of
titanium decay through the chain 44Ti→44Sc→44Ca can be
observed in broad range of energies – it produces on average

2

Tsygankov et al.

∼0.17, ∼0.88, ∼0.95 and ∼1 photons per one decay in the
lines at energies 4.1, 67.9, 78.4, and 1157 keV, respectively.
Hence, it could be detected by telescopes based on com-
pletely diﬀerent principals (an overview of previous results
is presented in Section 3.3).

Based on the comparison of the survey done by COMP-
TEL telescope onboard Compton Gamma-Ray Observa-
tory (CGRO) in the 1.157 MeV line (Dupraz et al. 1997;
Iyudin et al. 1999) with theoretical expectations The et al.
(2006) concluded that SNe producing 44Ti are not typical
events. Particularly, they expect 5-6 positive detections of
44Ti sources above COMPTEL’s sensitivity limit (∼ 10−5
ph cm−2 s−1 at 1σ level). However at that moment Cas
A was the only conﬁdently detected source of 44Ti emis-
sion (Iyudin et al. 1994). It is worth noting that more re-
cent calculations performed by Dufour & Kaspi (2013) give
results consistent with one detected 44Ti source in the
survey with sensitivity reached by COMPTEL. Only re-
cently, thanks to signiﬁcant exposures collected by hard
X-ray space telescopes currently operating in orbit (INTE-
GRAL/IBIS, Swift/BAT, NuSTAR), new evidence of SNRs
emitting in 44Ti lines started to appear, in particular SN
1987A (Grebenev et al. 2012; Boggs et al. 2015) and Ty-
cho’s SNR (Troja et al. 2014).

One of the main goal of the current paper is to search
for new and previously unknown 44Ti emission sources,
serendipitous detections of which could provide us informa-
tion about SN activity in the Milky Way within the last
few centuries. Last systematic survey for 44Ti sources in
MeV domain was conducted by COMPTEL in the work of
Dupraz et al. (1997) and Iyudin et al. (1999). The authors
did not detect new unknown 44Ti sources that was in agree-
ment with canonical values of 2.5 to 3 Galactic SN events per
century. Later, Renaud et al. (2004) conﬁrmed the absence
of new sources of 44Ti line emission in the ﬁrst survey of the
Galactic Centre region (|l| < 30◦) using the INTEGRAL
IBIS/ISGRI data from the ﬁrst year of operation.

Core-collapse SNe can be embedded in the dense molec-
ular clouds that gave birth to their massive progenitors. The
high column densities of the Galactic, local molecular cloud,
and even circumstellar obscuration may prevent detection
of such a recent SN events. Undetectable at optical wave-
length, young SNRs could be revealed through the decay of
44Ti in emission lines at 67.9 and 78.4 keV thanks to high
penetrating power of hard X-rays. As shown by recent detec-
tion of 44Ti from SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) by Grebenev et al. (2012), INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI
has the potential for detecting these sources even in the
nearby galaxies.

With sensitivity achieved in the current 12 years sur-
vey by INTEGRAL/IBIS in the Galactic Plane (factor of
2–5 better than COMPTEL) we can improve our knowl-
edge about recent SN activity in the Galaxy by model inde-
pendent and systematic-free imaging at better angular res-
olution (12′) in comparison to the COMPTEL experiment
(∼1◦), which is, however still not enough to resolve spatial
morphology of SNRs with typical size of a few arcmins.

In this paper we utilize main advantages of the INTE-
GRAL/IBIS telescope (large ﬁeld of view, high sensitivity
and energy resolution, huge amount of collected data) to sys-
tematically search for 44Ti emission (in the two low-energy

lines at 67.9 and 78.4 keV) from the Galactic SNRs, selected
at |b| < 17.5◦.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS

The INTEGRAL observatory (Winkler et al. 2003) has
demonstrated a great success in surveying the sky in hard
X-rays at energies above 20 keV. Large ﬁeld of view of
28◦ × 28◦, moderate angular resolution of a few arcmins,
and one of the highest sensitivity for the class of its optical
design (coding aperture) led to many relevant survey pa-
pers (see, e.g., Krivonos et al. 2012 and references therein).
Thanks to eﬀective work of the IBIS coded-mask telescope
(Ubertini et al. 2003) over more than ten years, we can con-
duct the ﬁrst imaging survey of the whole Galactic Plane in
titanium emission lines, signiﬁcantly extending the work by
Renaud et al. (2004) in the Galactic Centre. The fact that
INTEGRAL spent most of its observational time towards
the Galactic Plane, where most of the SNRs reside, makes
the current survey unprecedented in sensitivity and cover-
age.

For the current analysis we utilized all the publicly
available data taken until October, 2014 (or spacecraft rev-
olution 1469). The data were screened and reduced in ac-
cordance with our previous surveys (see e.g. Churazov et al.
2005, 2014; Krivonos et al. 2010 and references therein). To
take into account the long-term ISGRI detector degradation
and subsequent decrease in the eﬃciency (Caballero et al.
2013) we corrected for a secular gain variations and adjusted
the eﬃciency in each IBIS/ISGRI energy bands using the
ﬂux of the Crab nebula measured in the observation that
is closest in time (for details see Krivonos et al. 2012). This
method corresponds to a smooth recalibration of the an-
cillary response function (ARF) over the time span of the
survey. In our IBIS/ISGRI data analysis we use the diago-
nal energy redistribution matrix designed to reproduce Crab
spectrum in the form

dN/dE = 10.0 × E−2.1

keV phot cm−2 s−1 keV−1

(1)

which is a good representation of the historic Crab observa-
tions (see, e.g., Churazov et al. 2007).

The total list of the available data over the full sky
contains 99108 individual INTEGRAL pointings with typi-
cal exposure of 2 ks, or so called Science Window s (ScW s),
which corresponds to ∼ 178 Ms of the eﬀective exposure.
The data of the ISGRI detector layer (Lebrun et al. 2003)
for each ScW were converted into sky images in the en-
ergy bands of interest (deﬁned below). Similar to the INTE-
GRAL nine-year Galactic Plane survey by Krivonos et al.
(2012), the survey mosaicing was organized in six overlap-
ping 70◦ × 35◦ Galactic cartesian map projections centered
at b = 0◦ and l = 0◦ (GC), ±50◦, ±115◦, and l = 180◦
(Galactic anticenter). The latitude coverage of the current
survey |b| < 17.5◦ was chosen to take advantage of the large
IBIS ﬁeld of view and INTEGRAL observational pattern
in the Galactic Plane. The ﬁnal data set used in this work
comprises 62509 ScW s or 104 Ms of dead-time corrected
exposure, which corresponds to about 60% of the full data
set.

The search for the 44Ti lines at 67.9 and 78.4 keV im-
poses severe requirements on energy calibration precision of

the instruments. We used the most up-to-date ISGRI energy
reconstruction available through the Oﬄine Scientiﬁc Anal-
ysis (OSA) version 10.1, provided by ISDC1. As described
by Caballero et al. (2013), the energy resolution of ISGRI at
tungsten (W) ﬂuorescent line located at 58.8297 keV shows
gradual broadening from ∼ 5 to ∼ 10 keV (FWHM) over 10
years of the current mission life span, which still makes it
possible to study narrow 44Ti emission lines. To trace con-
tinuum and line emission we deﬁned working energy bands
as shown in Table 1. Two 44Ti lines at 67.9 and 78.4 keV are
accommodated in the energy bands E3 and E5, respectively,
and both lines are placed in E7 band. E5 is wider than E3
by 1 keV owing to an initial ISGRI energy resolution of 8%
at 60 keV (Lebrun et al. 2003). According to our measure-
ments, the average energy resolution (FWHM) at 60 keV
over the survey data span is ∼ 7.5 keV, which is compara-
ble to the width of the selected energy bands and consistent
with Caballero et al. (2013). To prevent any losses in the
44Ti line emission due to the ﬁnite energy resolution as a
reference energy band we took much broader E7 band con-
taining both lines.

Despite the great improvement of the ISGRI detector
absolute energy reconstruction in OSA 10.1 compared to
previous versions, the ∼ 1.5% gain variations during each
orbit are still present, which lead to ∼ 1 keV uncertainty
at ∼ 80 keV. We applied additional gain correction based
on the position of the tungsten ﬂuorescent line, suppressing
the uncertainty of energy reconstruction for the detector-
averaged line centroid to less than 0.1 keV.

3 RESULTS

3.1 The search for new sources of 44Ti line

emission

The search for new sources has been performed on each
projected mosaic images in the reference energy band E7
(64.6 − 82.2 keV) containing both 44Ti lines and therefore
providing better statistics. We deﬁned detection threshold
allowing not more than one false detection assuming pure
photon counting statistics. Given the angular resolution of
the IBIS telescope (12′), the Galactic survey (|b| < 17.5◦)
contains ∼ 3 × 105 independent pixels which can generate
one statistical ﬂuctuation at 4.7σ. We should stress that the
sensitivity of our 44Ti survey is limited by count statistics
only and not aﬀected by systematics, which seriously lim-
its the sensitivity of IBIS telescope at lower energies, espe-
cially in the crowded region of the Galactic Centre (see, e.g.,
Krivonos et al. 2010b, 2012). Fig. 1 shows a signal-to-noise
distribution of pixel values in the sky mosaic at l = 0◦ (blue
line) and l = +50◦ (red line) along with the normal distribu-
tion representing a statistical noise. Note that the positive
tail of this distribution is formed by continuum sources. As
seen from the ﬁgure (overall shape and, in particular, nega-
tive side of the distribution), the observed noise distribution
can be very well described by normal distribution with zero
mean and unit variance.

The source detection sensitivity of our 44Ti survey is
not completely uniform over the Galactic Plane (Fig. 2). The
maximum IBIS/ISGRI sensitivity is achieved in the region of
the Galactic Center (GC) which exhibit the largest exposure
accumulated over 12 years. The survey sky coverage in 64.6–
82.2 keV energy band (E7) as a function of a 4.7σ limiting
ﬂux is demonstrated in Fig. 3. The peak sensitivity is about
0.7 mCrab (1.8×10−11 erg s−1 cm−2 in E7 band) in the GC.
Regarding the range of the Galactic latitudes |b| < 17.5◦,
the survey covers 10% of its geometrical area (12680 deg2) at

(1.4 × 10−10 erg s−1 cm−2).

The peak sensitivity of our survey reached in the region
of the Galactic centre is 1.0 × 10−5 ph cm−2 s−1 (3σ) in E7
energy band, containing both 67.9 keV and 78.4 keV lines.
Taking into account the approximate equality of intensities
in these two lines the 3σ sensitivity per one 44Ti line in
the current INTEGRAL/IBIS survey can be recalculated as
∼ 4.8 × 10−6 ph cm−2 s−1. According to the diﬀerent eﬃ-
ciencies of emission in diﬀerent lines the corresponding sen-
sitivity in the 1.157 MeV line is ∼ 5.2 × 10−6 ph cm−2 s−1.
This is factor of ∼ 5 better than sensitivity of 2.7 × 10−5
ph cm−2 s−1 in the 1.157 MeV line (3σ) reached with the
COMPTEL experiment in the Galactic Plane (Dupraz et al.
1997; Iyudin et al. 1999). Regarding the Galactic Plane at
|l| < 50◦ a factor of ∼ 2 improvement in sensitivity is

achieved. To illustrate the improvement of sensitivity in the
current survey in comparison to the COMPTEL one, we
constructed the age-distance diagram assuming a 44Ti yield
of Y44 = 1 × 10−4 M⊙ (see Fig. 4; ages and distances for the
plotted SNRs are listed in Table 3).

The list of candidate sources detected with S/N > 4.7σ
and within latitude range of the current survey (|b| < 17.5◦)
contains only one previously unknown object, the source
IGR J18406 + 0451 found at position R.A.=18h 40m 40.80s,
Decl.=04d 51m 36.0s (equinox J2000), which is 15′ away
from the known low mass X-ray binary Serpens X-1
(Liu et al. 2007, listed as 3A 1837+049). The source was
registered with a ﬂux of 1.4 ± 0.28 mCrab (5.0σ detection)
in the E7 energy band. The localization accuracy of the
sources detected with IBIS/ISGRI depends on the source
signiﬁcance (Gros et al. 2003; Bird et al. 2006). According
to Krivonos et al. (2007), the positional 1σ uncertainty of
the source detected at S/N ≃ 5 − 6σ is 2.1′.

signiﬁcant detection in E1 (< 0.23 mCrab, 3σ);
in E2
(< 0.35 mCrab, 3σ); and in E6 (< 0.84 mCrab, 3σ) but
exhibits marginal detection in E3 (1.09 ± 0.39 mCrab, 2.8σ);
E4 (1.51 ± 0.69 mCrab, 2.19σ), and E5 (1.63 ± 0.51 mCrab,
3.2σ).

Assuming IGR J18406+0451 is a 44Ti emission source,
the combined probability of 44Ti line detection in E3 and E5
is 7 × 10−6 (∼ 4.5σ), which is lower than the E7 signiﬁcance
(5.0σ). This tells us that intermediate energy band E4 can
contain some contribution from 44Ti lines probably due to
the ISGRI spectral resolution (5–10 keV) at these energies.
This assumption is conﬁrmed by the combined probability
of signal detection in E3/E4/E5 bands, which is 7 × 10−6 or
5.2σ.

In all energy bands of the continuum emission E1, E2
and E6, IGR J18406+0451 is below the detection threshold,
while the source shows signiﬁcant (∼ 5σ) emission in E7

energy band containing two 44Ti emission lines, and this ex-
cess is dominated by the ﬂux in E3 and E5 bands, where the
two low-energy 44Ti lines are located. Owing to a relatively
high Galactic latitude of 4.6◦, we can expect the source can-
didate IGR J18406+0451 to be nearby, in particular if it is
the remnant of a core-collapse SN, potentially located in the
Sagittarius spiral arm at 2–3 kpc (Zhang et al. 2009).

In spite of a relatively high S/N ratio for this new source
it is still not far from the detection threshold (4.7σ) corre-
sponding to the registration of one false source in our survey.
Therefore additional observational evidence are required to
establish if the source is real or not.

For this purpose, we asked for DDT observations of this
region with the XMM-Newton observatory. These observa-
tions were performed on October 9, 2015 with a total expo-
sure of ∼ 30 ksec. Data were reduced with the standard SAS
software2. No bright sources were detected inside the INTE-
GRAL error circle. The search for faint sources met some
diﬃculties due to the illumination from the bright nearby
source Serpens X-1. A conservative point-source upper limit
(3σ) on the ﬂux at the IGR J18406+0451 position is about
8 × 10−14 ph cm−2 s−1 in the 0.5-10 keV energy band (under
the assumption of a power-law spectrum with slope Γ = −2).
It is important to note, that apart from hard X-ray
emission lines at 67.9 and 78.4 keV, there is another one
originated from the 44Ti decay – the 44Sc ﬂuorescence line
with the 44Ti emission in this line (with a branching ratio
of 0.17 per decay). The averaged nuclear de-excitation lines
ﬂux measured from IGR J18406+0451 F44 = 1.27 × 10−5
ph cm−2 s−1 can be translated into the expected ﬂux in the
4.1 keV line F4.1keV = 2.16 × 10−6 ph cm−2 s−1. An upper
limit (3σ) for the ﬂux in the narrow energy band 3.9-4.3
keV, derived from the XMM-Newton data, is ≃ 8 × 10−7
ph cm−2 s−1, that is several times lower than the above es-
timations. Note that the expected ﬂux in the 4.1 keV line
is true for the fully transparent SNR envelope and with no
additional absorption by the ISM gas along the line of sight
at these soft X-ray energies.

The obtained results can be interpreted in two ways:
the source candidate IGR J18406+0451 is a false detection
or its emission in soft X-rays is strongly absorbed. Thus,
additional observations in hard X-rays by instruments with
a better sensitivity and angular resolution (like NuSTAR)
are required to conﬁrm the detection of IGR J18406+0451.

3.2 A catalogue of Galactic supernova remnants

Thanks to the wide ﬁeld of view and good angular resolution
of the IBIS telescope we can for the ﬁrst time put upper lim-
its on the 44Ti line emission from all known Galactic SNRs.
For this purpose we used the catalog of Galactic SNRs pre-
sented in Green (2014). The catalogue contains 294 sources
revealed through radio and infra-red surveys, as well as X-
ray observations. Most of the SNRs are old, and generally
we do not expect to detect signiﬁcant signal from them, but
no systematic search for 44Ti emission has been performed
so far. Since we are looking at known sky positions, we can
go below detection threshold of the current survey (4.7σ)
and provide marginal detection or conservative upper limit.

2 http://xmm2.esac.esa.int/sas/

Table 2 lists measured ﬂuxes or 3σ upper limits towards
294 SNRs from Green (2014). As indicated in the notes to
the table, 60 SNRs are subject to spatial confusion within 12′
(the IBIS/ISGRI angular resolution) from known hard X-ray
sources. The measured ﬂux of 9 SNRs is most probably dom-
inated by the continuum emission of the associated X-ray
source, rather than by putative 44Ti line emission. If signif-
icance of the detection of such source is above 3σ level, an
upper limit (3σ) in the 78.4 keV line is also shown assuming a
simple power-law continuum model. Marginal detection (at
less than 3σ) of the 44Ti line emission and/or continuum
is registered from Tycho SNR (see Sec.3.3), G065.7+01.2,
G069.0+02.7, G315.1+02.7 and G356.3–01.5.

One of the main goals of this survey was to verify the 44Ti
line ﬂuxes from historical SNRs reported in the literature
and to provide an independent estimate of the corresponding
amount of synthesised 44Ti with much larger statistics avail-
able thanks to the whole INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI dataset.
List of the young (with ages not more than ∼ 1000 years)
Galactic SNRs with known (or estimated) dates of explosion
and distances used in our study is presented in Table 3.

To estimate the 44Ti ﬂux in the most robust way we
used the simplest model for the continuum emission – power-
law. This model
is usually assumed for ﬁtting the con-
tinuum of SNRs in the hard X-ray domain although it
is known that synchrotron emission does exhibit spectral
steepening beyond the cutoﬀ energy (e.g. Reynolds 1998;
Zirakashvili & Aharonian 2007). To take into account 44Ti
emission lines we introduced to the model two Gaussians
with ﬁxed positions at 67.9 and 78.4 keV, and intrinsic
widths ﬁxed at 10−3 keV. Additionally ﬂuxes in the two
lines were tied as F68 = 0.93F78. For the ﬁtting procedure
we used XSPEC v.12.8.1g.

2000). Later,

Renaud et al. (2006a) using about 4.5 Ms of INTE-
GRAL/ISGRI total exposure time detected both 67.9 and
78.4 keV lines with a ﬂux of (2.5±0.3)×10−5ph cm−2 s−1that
corresponds to a synthesised 44Ti mass of 1.6+0.6
−0.3 ×10−4 M⊙.
In a more recent work by Siegert et al. (2015) the INTE-
GRAL/SPI data were utilized. Measured ﬂuxes in the 78.4
keV and 1157 keV lines are (2.1±0.4)×10−5 ph cm−2 s−1and
(3.5 ± 1.2) × 10−5ph cm−2 s−1, which corresponds to (1.5 ±
0.4) × 10−4 and (2.4 ± 0.9) × 10−4 M⊙ of 44Ti, respectively.
Authors also pointed out that the reason for a signiﬁcantly
larger ﬂux in the 1157 keV line possibly could be an addi-
tional contribution to this line from nuclear de-excitation
following energetic particle collisions in the remnant and
swept-up material.

Using the high spatial

resolution and sensitivity
of the NuSTAR focusing high-energy X-ray telescope,
Grefenstette et al. (2014) were able to map the distribu-
tion of 44Ti emission over the Cas A supernova remnant.
Their result conﬁrmed previous claims of a highly asym-
metric explosion, needed to explain the observed amount of
synthesised 44Ti. Spectroscopic studies also revealed a red-
shift of the 67.9 keV line by 0.47 ± 0.21 keV, with a ﬂux of
(1.5 ± 0.3) × 10−5ph cm−2 s−1.

Our analysis conﬁrmed the presence of a highly signif-
icant emission component in the E7 energy band above the
continuum described by a simple power-law model with pho-
ton index of 2.9 ± 0.1. The obtained ﬂux in the 67.9 keV line
is F68 = (1.3 ± 0.3) × 10−5 ph cm−2 s−1. Both continuum
and line parameters are compatible within 1 − 2σ with re-
sults from Renaud et al. (2006a) based on smaller sample

of IBIS/ISGRI data. Also this values agree very well with
the recent NuSTAR result and most of previously published
measurements.

G1.9+0.3

One of the most promising sources of 44Ti emission in
our sample is G1.9+0.3. Based on the detected expansion
between 1985 and 2007 Reynolds et al. (2008) estimated its
age around 100 years, making this SNR the youngest one
in the Galaxy at distance around 8.5 kpc from the Sun.
Using the Chandra observations Borkowski et al. (2010) de-
tected a 4.1 keV line which was attributed to 44Sc ﬂuores-
cence emission. The estimated mass of synthesised 44Ti is
(1–7) × 10−5 M⊙ that corresponds to an expected ﬂux in
the 67.9 and 78.4 keV nuclear de-excitation lines around
(0.3–2.3) × 10−5ph cm−2 s−1. Later, the NuSTAR observa-

and a yield of 1 × 10−4 M⊙ were assumed.

tory put a 95% upper limit for the 67.9 keV line around
1.5 × 10−5ph cm−2 s−1for an assumed line width (1 sigma)
of 4 keV (Zoglauer et al. 2015).

In our survey we did not detect a signiﬁcant ﬂux from
G1.9+0.3 with a corresponding 3σ upper limit of 9 × 10−6
ph cm−2 s−1. This upper limit is more constraining than the
one obtained with NuSTAR but still compatible within the
errors with the reported 4.1 keV line ﬂux.

GRO J0852-4642 / RX J0852.0-4622 / G266.2-1.2 /
Vela Jr

COMPTEL discovered a source of 44Ti

line emis-
sion from a previously unknown Galactic SNR in the
Vela region, named Vela Jr, with a ﬂux of (3.8 ± 0.7) ×
10−5ph cm−2 s−1in the 1.157 MeV line (Iyudin et al. 1998).
Later Sch¨onfelder et al. (2000) have shown this detection
to be much less signiﬁcant due to technical issues related to
the background modeling and event selection. Doubts about
the reality of the 44Ti line detection were also raised by
the age and distance estimates pointed towards a more dis-
tant and older SNR than originally thought (e.g. Slane et al.
2001; Katsuda, Tsunemi, & Mori 2008). At lower energies
some evidence of 4.1 keV line identiﬁed with 44Sc were re-
ported by Tsunemi et al. (2000), Iyudin et al. (2005) and
Bamba, Yamazaki, & Hiraga (2005). However, Slane et al.
(2001) and Hiraga et al. (2009) did not conﬁrm these detec-
tions, making future studies very important.

In our survey we did not detect the signal from the
44Ti decay. The corresponding 3σ upper limit is 1.8 × 10−5
ph cm−2 s−1. Thus the INTEGRAL/IBIS measurement ex-
cludes the detection made by the COMPTEL experiment
under assumption of a point-like source, conﬁrming results
of similar analysis performed by Renaud et al. (2006b). Tak-
ing into account that SNR has a diameter of 2◦, a more de-
tailed study should be carried out in order to properly derive
a consistent upper limit as a function of the source extent.

Tycho’s Supernova / SN 1572

The Swift/BAT telescope discovered a signiﬁcant emis-
sion excess above the continuum level in the 60–85 keV
energy band in the spectrum of Tycho SNR (Troja et al.
2014). It is the ﬁrst evidence for a detection of 44Ti de-
cay emission in a Type Ia SNR. The ﬂux in the 78.4 keV
line was measured to be (1.4 ± 0.6) × 10−5ph cm−2 s−1that
corresponds to a 44Ti mass around 10−4 M⊙ depending on
the distance to the SNR (see Troja et al. 2014). Marginal
detection (signiﬁcance level ∼ 2.6σ) of a bump feature
in the 60–90 keV band was reported also by Wang & Li
(2014) using the INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope data. The cor-
responding 3σ upper limit for the 44Ti
line emission of
1.5 × 10−5ph cm−2 s−1which coincides with earlier result ob-
tained by Renaud et al. (2006b) using the INTEGRAL/IBIS
data as well. An indication of the spatial co-location of the
post-shock Ti with other iron-peak nuclei was found using
XMM-Newton data (Miceli et al. 2015).

However, the more recent NuSTAR observations did
not ﬁnd evidence for 44Ti emission in the spectrum of
Tycho SNR with the upper limit F78 < 7.5 × 10−6
ph cm−2 s−1 (90% conﬁdence level), ruling out the above-
mentioned Swift/BAT and INTEGRAL/IBIS detections
(Lopez et al. 2015). The corresponding upper limit on the
44Ti yield was found to be M44 < 8.4 × 10−5 M⊙ assuming
distance to the SNR of 2.3 kpc.

To shed further light on the existence of the 44Ti emis-
sion in the spectrum of Tycho SNR we have performed a
ﬁt to the measured IBIS/ISGRI spectrum, as for the other
young SNRs in our sample. With the achieved sensitiv-
ity we can not conﬁdently conﬁrm the detection made by
Swift/BAT (Troja et al. 2014). Inclusion of the 44Ti lines
into the ﬁtting model consisting of a simple power-law gives
a ﬂux in the 78.4 keV line F78 = (5 ± 3) × 10−6 ph cm−2 s−1,
compatible with the above-mentioned upper limit obtained
with NuSTAR (Lopez et al. 2015).

Kepler

Detection of the 44Ti emission from the Kepler SNR
has not been claimed so far. 3σ upper limit in 1.157 MeV
line obtained in the COMPTEL Galactic survey is 1.8×10−5
ph cm−2 s−1 (Dupraz et al. 1997; Iyudin et al. 1999). We did
not detect a signiﬁcant ﬂux from the source in any working
energy bands (see Tab. 1) either. Upper limit obtained in
our survey is 6.3 × 10−6 ph cm−2 s−1(3σ) per line.

SN 1987A

The only known extragalactic source of 44Ti decay emis-
sion is SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud where the
INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope detected signiﬁcant ﬂux in the
67.9 and 78.4 keV lines (Grebenev et al. 2012). The com-
bined ﬂux in both lines was measured to be (1.5 ± 0.4) ×
10−5ph cm−2 s−1that can be translated into a 44Ti mass of
(3.1 ± 0.8) × 10−4 M⊙. Later the NuSTAR telescope con-
ﬁrmed the existence of both lines, but with somewhat lower
ﬂux corresponding to a 44Ti yield of (1.5 ± 0.3) × 10−4 M⊙
(Boggs et al. 2015).

The INTEGRAL survey described above includes ad-
ditional data compared to Grebenev et al. (2012) and

Because SN 1987A is located in another galaxy (LMC) a

(Grebenev et al., in preparation).

Per OB2

In addition to the aforementioned sources one can point
another potential source of 44Ti emission located in the re-
gion of Perseus OB2 association. Some hints of a weak signal
(at signiﬁcance level around ∼ 3σ) in the 1.157 MeV line
from this region was reported by Dupraz et al. (1997) us-
ing the COMPTEL data. We did not detect any signiﬁcant
point-like source in the vicinity of Per OB2 with 3σ upper
limit ∼ 1.5 mCrab (3.3 × 10−5 ph cm−2 s−1).

4 SUMMARY

In this work we performed a systematic search for 44Ti line
emission at 67.9 and 78.7 keV with the IBIS/ISGRI instru-
ment aboard the INTEGRAL observatory. The long expo-
sure collected by the mission in the Galactic Plane allowed
us to put strong limits on the 44Ti line emission and improve
the previous constraints made with COMPTEL experiment
in the 1.157 MeV 44Ti line emission by a factor of 2–5.

Sensitivity of the current survey is governed by pho-
tons count statistics only which allowed us to set up the
lowest possible detection threshold while not ﬂooding the
catalog of candidate sources by false detections. Expect-
ing only one statistical ﬂuctuation above 4.7σ, we detected
a 44Ti source candidate IGR J18406+0451 with S/N=5σ.
However, deep XMM-Newton observation does not show the
presence of a bright source in this region, indicating that
IGR J18406+0451 is either a false detection or its emission
in soft X-rays is strongly absorbed (either locally or due to
the ISM gas along the line of sight).

Among historical SNRs only Cas A shows signiﬁcant
detection with a ﬂux F68 = (1.3±0.3)×10−5 ph cm−2 s−1 in
agreement with most of previously published measurements.

This ﬂux corresponds to (1.1 ± 0.3) × 10−4 M⊙ of 44Ti that
is at the upper boundary of the theoretical predictions for
core-collapse SNe (see, e.g., Timmes et al. 1996).

We put strong upper limits on the detection of 44Ti
emission in other historical SNRs and potential 44Ti sources
mentioned in the literature: Vela Jr, Tycho (SN1572), Per
OB2 and G1.9+0.3. Regarding the latter, we derived a more
constraining upper limit on the 44Ti line emission than that
obtained with NuSTAR (Zoglauer et al. 2015) by a factor of
few.

Predicted 44Ti yield for Type Ia SNe is scattered from
∼ 8 × 10−6 M⊙ in the classical deﬂagration model (W7
in Nomoto, Thielemann, & Yokoi 1984; Maeda et al. 2010)
to f ew × 10−3 M⊙ in the so-called double detonation sub-
Chandrasekhar model, when the explosion is triggered by
an explosion at the surface of the white dwarf (models 1-4
in Fink et al. 2010).

Figure 5 shows the comparison of the 3σ upper limits
on the 44Ti yield from Type Ia SNe obtained in this work
with predictions of diﬀerent models. Such extreme models as
double detonation (Fink et al. 2010) or helium deﬂagration
(Woosley & Kasen 2011), predicting > 10−3 M⊙ of 44Ti,
are clearly ruled out by the observational data. At the same
time broad range of models predicting 44Ti yields below
∼ 10−5 M⊙ is consistent with our results. For the illus-
tration purposes in Fig. 5 the fast deﬂagration W7 model
(Nomoto, Thielemann, & Yokoi 1984) and delayed detona-
tion model which follows an extremely oﬀ-center deﬂagra-
tion (O-DDT model in Maeda et al. 2010) are shown by
dashed and dash-dot lines, respectively.

Finally we put strong upper limits for all Galactic SNRs
reported in the catalog by Green (2014). The obtained up-
per limits can be used to estimate the exposure times needed
to detect 44Ti emission from any known SNR using existing
and prospective X- and gamma-ray telescopes. Moreover,
more or less homogeneous coverage of the Galactic Plane
with INTEGRAL (see Fig. 2) permits to estimate an upper
limit on the titanium emission from any potentially interest-
ing place in the Galaxy: starburst regions, high-absorption
regions such as the spiral arm tangents, and to revisit the
issue about the main sources of Galactic 44Ca (The et al.
2006; Dufour & Kaspi 2013). In particular, well known gi-
ant molecular cloud Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) located about
120 pc from the center of the Milky Way emits not more
than 5.1 × 10−6 ph cm−2 s−1 (3σ upper limit) per 44Ti line;
the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex containing many bright
nebulae, dark clouds, and young stars has a 3σ upper limit
of 1.5 × 10−5 ph cm−2 s−1per line; a 3σ upper limit for the
ﬂux from the Norma and Sagittarius spiral arms tangents is
1.0×10−5 ph cm−2 s−1 per line. Among extragalactic objects
one of the most interesting is the Tarantula Nebula (known
as 30 Doradus) in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This most
active starburst region in the Local Group emits less than
0.9 × 10−6 ph cm−2 s−1.

1 Catalogue is sorted by source name, which is in turn, based on Galactic coordinates.
2 The upper limits are given at 3σ conﬁdence level. In case of a source detection, the signiﬁcance is shown in parenthesis.
3 The spatial confusion with a known hard X-ray source (shown in parenthesis) is indicated. SNRs dominated by the continuum ﬂux
are marked as well. If signiﬁcance of the detection of such source is above 3σ level, an upper limit (3σ) in the 78.4 keV line is shown
assuming a simple power-law continuum model.
