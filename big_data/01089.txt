Locally decreasing the impulse transmitted by periodic pulses is shown to be a reliable method of
taming chaos in starlike networks of dissipative nonlinear oscillators, leading to both synchronous
periodic states and equilibria (oscillation death). Speciﬁcally, the paradigmatic model of damped
kicked rotators is studied in which it is assumed that when the rotators are driven synchronously,
i.e., all driving pulses transmit the same impulse, the networks display chaotic dynamics. It is found
that the taming eﬀect of decreasing the impulse transmitted by the pulses acting on particular
nodes strongly depends on their number and degree of connectivity. A theoretical analysis is given
explaining the basic physical mechanism as well as the main features of the chaos-control scenario.

INTRODUCTION

Controlling the dynamical state of a complex network is a fundamental problem in science [1-5] with many potential
applications, including neuronal disorders in brain networks [6] and evaluation of risks in ﬁnancial markets [7]. While
most of these works consider networks of linear systems [1,2,5], only recently has the general and richer case of networks
of nonlinear systems [4] started to be investigated. Here we are interested in controlling networks in the sense of driving
the network from a subset of particular chaotic initial states to a subset of ﬁnal (stable) regular states with the view of
not merely identifying driver nodes but also their relative eﬀectiveness as well as obtaining estimates of the regions in
parameter space where suitable control signals are eﬀective. Regarding the control (suppression and enhancement) of
chaotic states, which is of fundamental interest partly because of the ubiquity of chaos in nature, including man-made
systems, and partly because of its practical relevance [8-10], it has been shown that the application of judiciously
chosen periodic external excitations is a reliable procedure for taming chaos in diverse coupled systems such as arrays
of electrochemical oscillators [11], Frenkel-Kontorova chains [12], and recurrent neural networks [13], just to cite a
few instances. Most studies of coupled nonlinear systems subjected to external excitations have focused on either
global (all-to-all) or local (homogeneous) diﬀusive-type coupling, while little attention has been paid to the possible
inﬂuences of a heterogeneous connectivity on the regularization of a network’s dynamics.

Many diverse real-world networks exhibit heterogeneous connectivity in the form of a scale-free topology [14] which
means that just a small set of nodes are highly connected −the so-called hubs− while the rest of the nodes have few
connections. Since starlike structures are the main motifs of scale-free networks, here we study the control of chaos
in starlike networks of dissipative driven nonlinear oscillators, expecting that the main features of such an impulse
control scenario may be extensible to the case of scale-free networks. This is a major motivation for the present work.
Chaos control and synchronization are deeply related phenomena [9], and there have been recent studies of diverse
synchronization phenomena in oscillator networks with starlike couplings [15-18].

We shall consider a topology-induced chaos-control scenario in starlike networks of dissipative non-autonomous
systems subjected to local chaos-suppressing (CS) external excitations. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁndings will be discussed
through the analysis of starlike networks of N damped kicked rotators (DKRs) – see Fig. 1 top. This system is
suﬃciently simple to allow analytical predictions while retaining the universal characteristics of a dissipative chaotic
system. The complete model system reads

2

i = 1, ..., N − 1, and where all variables and parameters are dimensionless: Ω = Ω (T, m) ≡ 2K(m)/T , T is the
excitation period, δ is the damping coeﬃcient, λ is the coupling constant, cn (·; m) is the Jacobian elliptic function of
parameter m, and K(m) is the complete elliptic integral of the ﬁrst kind. Equations (1) describe the dynamics of a
highly connected rotator (or hub), xH , and N − 1 linked rotators (or leaves), xi. The shape parameter is taken to be
m = 0 except for certain sets of rotators that are subjected to pulses of variable width (m ∈ [0, 1]). The wave form of
the pulse is varied solely by changing m between 0 and 1. Increasing m makes the pulse narrower, and for m ≃ 1 one
recovers a periodic sharply kicking excitation very close to the periodic δ function, but with ﬁnite amplitude and width
(see Fig. 1 bottom). Also, cn2 (Ωt; m = 0) = cos2 (πt/T ), while at the other limit, m = 1, the pulse area vanishes.
It is worth mentioning that the limiting case m = δ = λ = 0 corresponds to an isolated Hamiltonian kicked rotator
subjected to trigonometric pulses, which has been used to describe the center-of-mass motion of cold atoms in an
amplitude-modulated standing wave of light [19], and that numerical studies have shown the suppressory eﬀectiveness
of decreasing the impulse transmitted by localized periodic pulses in homogeneous chains of DKRs [20].

Here we describe theoretical and numerical studies of the new chaos-control scenario arising from Eq. (1) by
assuming parameter values such that each isolated rotator driven by trigonometric pulses (m = 0) displays chaotic
behavior characterized by a positive Lyapunov exponent [21,22]. The remainder of the communication is organized as
follows. Section II studies both the chaotic dynamics and the oscillation death (OD) [23] of isolated rotators (Eq.(1)
with λ = 0). Analytical estimates of the chaotic threshold in parameter space are obtained by using Melnikov’s
method (MM) [24,25], while the phenomenon of OD is anticipated theoretically with the aid of an energy analysis.
The interplay between heterogeneous connectivity and local decrease of the pulse’s impulse in networks described
by Eq. (1) is discussed in Sec. III. We characterize a fairly complex regularization scenario, and determine how the
eﬀectiveness of the local reshaping of pulses depends upon the number of control nodes and their degree of connectivity.
Finally, Sec. IV is devoted to a discussion of the major ﬁndings and to some concluding remarks.

II. DYNAMICS OF ISOLATED ROTATORS

Before considering the chaos-control scenario of DKRs coupled in a starlike topology, it is necessary to understand

the main features of the dynamics of an isolated DKR:

..
x + cn2 (Ωt; m) sin x = −δ

.
x.

(2)

In particular, we are interested in obtaining an analytical estimate of the order-chaos threshold in parameter space, and

in providing a theoretical argument showing that the equilibrium (cid:0)x = 0,

for pulses of a (certain) ﬁnite width (m < 1). For the sake of clarity, we shall consider these analyses separately.

.

x = 0(cid:1) may be a stable attractor of Eq. (2)

A. Order-chaos threshold

To obtain analytical estimates of the chaotic threshold in parameter space (T, m, δ), we ﬁrst note that Eq. (2) can

be recast into the form

..
x + sin x = −δ

.
x + sn2 (Ωt; m) sin x,

(3)

where sn (·; m) is the Jacobian elliptic function of parameter m, and assume that the DKR (3) satisﬁes the MM
requirements, i.e., the dissipation and parametric excitation terms are small-amplitude perturbations of the underlying
..
conservative pendulum
x + sin x = 0. Melnikov introduced a function (the so-called Melnikov function (MF), M (t0))
which measures the distance between the perturbed stable and unstable manifolds in the Poincar´e section at t0. If
the MF presents a simple zero, the manifolds intersect transversally and chaotic instabilities result. See Refs. [24,25]
for more details about MM. Regarding Eq. (3), note that, in keeping with the assumption of the MM [24,25], it is
assumed that one can write δ = εδ, where 0 < ε ≪ 1 while δ is of order unity. The term sn2 (Ωt; m) sin x in Eq. (3) is
not O (ε), and one should not consider it to be a perturbative term. However, this will be assumed in calculating the
MF so as to obtain an eﬀective estimate of the chaotic threshold in parameter space which may be useful in explaining
the results of the numerical experiments. Thus, bearing in mind this caveat, the application of MM to Eq. (3) yields

θ0 (t) = ±2 sech (t) .

(5)

If M ± (t0) has a simple zero, then a heteroclinic bifurcation occurs, signifying the onset of chaotic instabilities. From
Eq. (4) one sees that

If the damping coeﬃcient is such that

this relationship represents a suﬃcient condition for M ± (t0) to always have the same sign, i.e., M ± (t0) 6 0. Thus,
a necessary condition for M ± (t0) to change sign at some t0 is written

where the chaotic threshold damping is

δ < δth (T, m) ,

δth (T, m) ≡

From Eq. (7) one readily obtains

lim

T →0,∞

δth (T, m) = lim
m→1

δth (T, m) = 0,

(6)

(7)

i.e., in such limits chaotic dynamics is not expected. Also, one ﬁnds that δth (T, m) presents a maximum in the
m − T plane at (m = mmax, T = Tmax). A plot of δth (T, m) is shown in Fig. 2 top. Let us consider the chaotic
threshold damping as a function of T , holding m constant. Plots of δth (T, m = const) show that each curve presents
a maximum Tmax = Tmax(m) such that Tmax(m) increases from its value at m = 0 as m → 1 (see Fig. 2 medium).
Now we study the chaotic threshold damping as a function of m, holding T constant. Plots of δth (T = const, m)
show that each curve presents a maximum mmax = mmax(T ) such that mmax(T ) increases as T is increased (see Fig
2 bottom). Thus, these MM-based predictions indicate that by suﬃciently decreasing the impulse transmitted by the
pulses (time integral over a period), i.e., when m is suﬃciently near 1, is a reliable procedure for suppressing chaos
irrespective of the values of the remaining parameters. We will show in Sec. III how numerical simulations of starlike
networks of DKRs conﬁrmed the eﬀectiveness of this chaos-control procedure.

B. Energy-based analysis

By analyzing the variation of the system’s kinetic energy, one straightforwardly predicts the occurrence of the

phenomenon of OD. Indeed, Eq. (3) has the associated energy equation

Now, after applying the ﬁrst mean value theorem for integrals [26] together with well-known properties of the Jacobian
elliptic functions [27] to the last integral on the right-hand side of Eq. (9), one has

where t∗ ∈ [nT, nT + T ], while

(10)

(11)

is the impulse transmitted by the pulse over a period with E(m) being the complete elliptic integral of the second
kind. From Eq. (11) one straightforwardly obtains I (T, m = 0) = T /2, I (T, m = 1) = 0. A plot of I (T, m) is shown
in Fig. 3. Now, if we consider ﬁxing the parameters (δ, T ) for the DKR to exhibit chaotic dynamics at m = 0, there
always exists an n = n∗ such that the kinetic energy increment

∆Em=0

K ≡ EK (n∗T + T ) − EK (n∗T ) > 0.

In this situation, one decreases the impulse by increasing the shape parameter from m = 0 while holding the remaining
parameters constant. Equations (10) and (11) predict that, for each n∗, there always exists a minimum critical value
m = mc > 0 such that the corresponding energy increment ∆Em=mc
< 0 for all n > n∗, and hence the equilibrium
(cid:0)x = 0,

x = 0(cid:1) is the single attractor of the DKR for m > mc. Note that this property comes ultimately from the

behavior of the impulse I (T, m) as the shape parameter m → 1 (see Fig. 3), i.e., that the DKR eﬀectively behaves as
a purely damped pendulum for suﬃciently narrow pulses.

III. LOCALIZED CONTROL IN STARLIKE NETWORKS

In this section, we study the relative eﬀectiveness of locally reshaping the pulses cn2 (Ωt; m), in the sense of
decreasing their impulse, on M nodes of chaotic starlike networks of N DKRs (cf. Eq. (1), M < N ) while holding the
remaining parameters constant. Before applying any control, we assume parameter values (δ, T ) such that each isolated
rotator driven by trigonometric pulses (m = 0) displays chaotic behavior. Equation (1) was numerically integrated
using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm with a time step dt = 0.001. To visualize the global spatiotemporal
dynamics of networks, we calculated the average velocity

(12)

where j is an integer multiple of the pulse period T , while the degree of synchronization is characterized by the

cos [xi (jT ) − xl (jT )] ,

(13)

with the summation being over all pairs of rotators. Note that C(t) is 1(0) for the perfectly synchronized (desynchro-
nized) state.

A. Control on a single peripheral rotator

5

Let us ﬁrst consider the eﬀect of decreasing the pulses’ impulse on a single peripheral rotator (M = 1) while the
remaining rotators, including the hub, are subjected to trigonometric pulses (m = 0). Note that this could be, a
priori, the most unfavorable case in terms of completely regularizing the whole network. Numerical simulations
indicate, however, that regularization to periodic states is possible over certain coupling intervals even for relatively
wide pulses, such as for m = 0.9 (see Fig. 4(a)), as expected from the above MM-based predictions. The symmetry
of the bifurcation diagrams comes from the DKR’s symmetry with respect to the transformation (xi → −xi), i.e., if

(cid:2)xi(t),

xi (t)(cid:3) is a solution of Eq. (1), then so is (cid:2)−xi(t), −

xi (t)(cid:3). The bifurcation diagram was constructed by means

of a Poincar´e map at the parameters indicated in the caption to Fig. 4. Starting at λ = 0, and taking the transient
time as 500 pulse periods after every increment of ∆λ = 3.3 × 10−3, we sampled 20 pulse periods by picking up
the ﬁrst σ, C values of every pulse cycle, respectively. In accordance with the above energy analysis, we typically
ﬁnd that the phenomenon of OD occurs over certain coupling intervals for suﬃciently narrow pulses, the equilibrium

.

.

.

(cid:0)x = 0,
shown in Fig. 4(b) for m = 1 − 10−14. In general, the equilibrium (cid:0)x = 0,

x = 0(cid:1) being the asymptotic behavior of the perfectly synchronized network, as in the illustrative instance
x = 0(cid:1) becomes stable at a certain value

λ = λmin via a boundary crisis, while it becomes unstable at a certain higher value λ = λmax via a supercritical
Hopf bifurcation [28]. These threshold values of the coupling, λmax,min, depend upon the remaining parameters. In
particular, the dependence on the number of rotators N of the width of the coupling interval in which OD occurs,
∆λ = ∆λ (N ) ≡ λmax (N )−λmin (N ), follows a linear law, as is shown in Fig. 5. Note that ∆λ → 0 as N approximates
a suﬃciently large but ﬁnite number of rotators.

.

B. Control on an increasing number of peripheral rotators

It is interesting to study the accumulative eﬀect of decreasing the pulses’ impulse on an increasing number of
peripheral rotators (M > 1), while the hub remains subjected to trigonometric pulses, in the weak coupling regime
where synchronization phenomena do not yet dominate the networks’ dynamics. We start from a situation where
regularization is not possible for almost any value of the shape parameter m when the pulses’ impulse is decreased on a
single peripheral rotator (M = 1, see Fig. 6(a)). Then, by increasing M from unity, one typically obtains regularization
of the whole network for suﬃciently narrow pulses, on the one hand, and a deterioration of the synchronization of the
chaotic dynamics for wider pulses on the other (see Fig. 6(b)). This further eﬀect, which is especially noticeable when
M is near N/2 (compare the case M = 5 with the cases M = 1 and M = 7, cf. Figs. 6(b), 6(a), and 6(c), respectively),
is due to the appearance of two diﬀerent synchronized populations of rotators subjected respectively to pulses of
diﬀerent widths. As M approximates N − 1, i.e., when the impulse control is applied to all the peripheral rotators,
the width of the interval ∆m where reshaping-induced regularization occurs increases, while the synchronization
increases drastically even when the dynamics is chaotic, as for M = 9 = N − 1 (see Fig. 6(d)).

C. Control on the central rotator

In the present subsection and the next, we study the role played by the degree of connectivity in the reshaping-
induced chaos-control scenario by decreasing the pulses’ impulse on the central rotator. In the case of a single control
(the present subsection), one ﬁnds that controlling the most highly connected rotator is by far the most eﬀective
control procedure (compare Fig. 7 with Fig. 6(a)). Strikingly, solely decreasing the impulse of the pulses acting on
the hub (M = 0) is a much better choice than controlling even several peripheral rotators but not the hub, as in the
case M = 5 = N/2 shown in Fig. 6(b). The reason for this relatively good eﬀectiveness stems from two facts. First,
solely controlling the hub does not signiﬁcantly break the synchronization of the whole network when N is suﬃciently
large (as for N = 10, cf. Fig. 7). Second, its maximum degree of connectivity allows the hub to directly inﬂuence all
the remaining (peripheral) rotators−in the sense of taming their chaotic dynamics−due to it is behaving as an energy
sink for suﬃciently narrow pulses, as seen in the energy analysis above (cf. Sec. II B).

D. Control on both the central and the peripheral rotators

Once the hub has been subjected to impulse control, one could expect a priori that additionally controlling other
(peripheral) rotators should improve the network’s regularization. When the impulse transmitted by the control
pulses is comparable to that transmitted by the trigonometric pulses (see Fig. 3), one typically ﬁnds the opposite eﬀect

6

however: a deterioration of the network’s regularization, as for the case M = 1 (cf. Fig. 8(a)). This deterioration eﬀect,
which occurs together with increasing desynchronization, persists, and even increases, as the number of peripheral
rotators subjected to control is increased, as for the case M = 5 = N/2 (cf. Fig. 8(b)) where desynchronization is
maximum (compare Fig. 8(b) with Figs. 8(a) and 8(c) which correspond to the cases M = 1 and M = 7, respectively).
As expected, when all rotators are subjected to the same impulse control, as for the case M = 9 (cf. Fig. 8(d)), the
network synchronization becomes perfect and the regularization route as the shape parameter is varied coincides with
that of an isolated rotator subjected to the same remaining parameters, involving several consecutive crises followed

by an inverse period doubling to ﬁnally reach the equilibrium (cid:0)x = 0,

IV. DISCUSSION

.

x = 0(cid:1) when m is suﬃciently near 1.

To summarize, we have demonstrated theoretically and numerically that the impulse transmitted by periodic
pulses is a fundamental quantity for the reliable control of the chaotic behavior of starlike networks of damped kicked
rotators. We have shown how the eﬀectiveness of pulse reshaping, when it is applied to a single node, strongly
depends upon the degree of the target node: applying impulse-decreasing pulses to the highest-degree node is by
far the best suppressory strategy, while applying them to low-degree nodes is the poorest choice.
In the case of
applying pulse control to several nodes, we found rather counterintuitive results: more is not only diﬀerent but often
means poorer regularization. We have shown that this is due to desynchronization phenomena which result from
the competition between two comparable populations of rotators subjected to pulses transmitting comparable but
diﬀerent impulses. When the pulses’ impulse is suﬃciently small, the rotator subjected to control behaves as an
energy sink for the remaining rotators, and this is ultimately the basic physical mechanism leading to the network’s
regularization. Clearly, the eﬀectiveness of this localized dissipation of energy strongly depends upon the target node’s
degree, which explains why controlling the central node is a much better choice than controlling a peripheral node.
The decreasing-impulse-induced chaos-control scenario discussed could ﬁnd applications in diverse biological coupled
systems [29], including neuronal networks [30]. It may also be useful to optimally control chaos in scale-free networks
of dissipative periodically-kicked oscillators since a highly connected node in such a network can be thought of as a
hub of a locally starlike part of the network, with a degree of connectivity that belongs to the complete network’s
degree-of-connectivity distribution.
