Graded PI-exponents of simple Lie

superalgebras

Duˇsan Repovˇs and Mikhail Zaicev

Abstract. We study Z2-graded identities of simple Lie superalgebras over a ﬁeld of charac-

teristic zero. We prove the existence of the graded PI-exponent for such algebras.

1. Introduction

Let A be an algebra over a ﬁeld F with char F=0. A natural way of measuring
the polynomial identities satisﬁed by A is by studying the asymptotic behaviour
. If A is a ﬁnite dimensional
of its sequence of codimensions {cn(A)}, n=1, 2, ...
algebra then the sequence {cn(A)} is exponentially bounded.
In this case it is
natural to ask the question about existence of the limit

lim
n→∞

npcn(A)

(1)

called the PI-exponent of A. Such question was ﬁrst asked for associative algebras
by Amitsur at the end of 1980’s. A positive answer was given in [6]. Subsequently it
was shown that the same problem has a positive solution for ﬁnite dimensional Lie
algebras [14], for ﬁnite dimensional alternative and Jordan algebras [5] and for some
other classes. Recently it was shown that in general the limit (1) does not exist
even if {cn(A)} is exponentially bounded [15]. The counterexample constructed in
[15] is inﬁnite dimensional whereas for ﬁnite dimensional algebras the problem of
the existence of the PI-exponent is still open. Nevertheless, if dim A<∞ and A is
simple then the PI-exponent of A exists as it was proved in [8].

If in addition A has a group grading then graded identities, graded codimen-
In this paper we discuss

sions and graded PI-exponents can also be considered.

graded codimensions behaviour for ﬁnite dimensional simple Lie superalgebras.
Graded codimensions of ﬁnite dimensional Lie superalgebras were studied in a num-
ber of papers (see for example, [11] and [12]). In particular, in [11] an upper bound
of graded codimension growth was found for one of the series of simple Lie super-
algebras.

In the present paper we prove that the graded PI-exponent of any ﬁnite di-
mensional simple Lie superalgebra always exists. All details concerning numerical
PI-theory can be found in [7].

2. Main constructions and deﬁnitions

Let L=L0⊕L1 be a Lie superalgebra. Elements from the component L0 are
called even and elements from L1 are called odd. Denote by L(X, Y ) a free Lie super-
algebra with inﬁnite sets of even generators X and odd generators Y . A polynomial
f =f (x1, ..., xm, y1, ..., yn)∈L(X, Y ) is said to be a graded identity of Lie superalge-
bra L=L0⊕L1 if f (a1, ..., am, b1, ..., bn)=0 whenever a1, ..., am ∈L0, b1, ..., bn ∈L1.

Denote by Idgr(L) the set of all graded identities of L. Then Idgr(L) is an
ideal of L(X, Y ). Given non-negative integers 0≤k≤n, let Pk,n−k be the subspace
of all multilinear polynomials f =f (x1, ..., xk, y1, ..., yn−k)∈L(X, Y ) of degree k on
even variables and of degree n−k on odd variables. Then Pk,n−k ∩Idgr(L) is the
subspace of all multilinear graded identities of L of total degree n depending on k
even variables and n−k odd variables. Denote also by Pk,n−k(L) the quotient

Pk,n−k(L) =

Pk,n−k

Pk,n−k ∩Idgr(L)

.

Then the partial graded (k, n−k)-codimension of L is

ck,n−k(L) = dim Pk,n−k(L)

and the total graded nth codimension of L is

cgr
n (L) =

n

Xk=0

(cid:18)n
k(cid:19)ck,n−k(L).

(2)

If the sequence {cgr

n (L)}n≥1 is exponentially bounded then one can consider
n (L). The latter sequence has the following lower

and upper limits

called the lower and upper PI-exponents of L, respectively. If the ordinary limit
exists, it is called the (ordinary) graded PI-exponent of L,

expgr(L) = lim
n→∞

nqcgr

n (L).

Symmetric groups and their representations play an important role in the the-
ory of codimensions. In particular, in the case of graded identities one can con-
sider the Sk ×Sn−k-action on multilinear graded polynomials. Namely, the subspace
Pk,n−k ⊆L(X, Y ) has a natural structure of Sk ×Sn−k-module where Sk acts on even
variables x1, ..., xk while Sn−k acts on odd variables y1, ..., yn−k. Clearly, Pk,n−k ∩
Idgr(L) is the submodule under this action and we get an induced Sk ×Sn−k-action
on Pk,n−k(L). The character χk,n−k(L)=χ(Pk,n−k(L)) is called (k, n−k) cochar-
acter of L. Since char F=0, this character can be decomposed into the sum of
irreducible characters

χk,n−k(L) = Xλ⊢k

µ⊢n−k

mλ,µχλ,µ

(3)

where λ and µ are partitions of k and n−k, respectively. All details concerning
representations of symmetric groups can be found in [9]. An application of Sn-
representations in PI-theory can be found in [1,?,?].

Recall that an irreducible Sk ×Sn−k-module with the character χλ,µ is the
tensor product of Sk-module with the character χλ and Sn−k-module with the
character χµ. In particular, the dimension deg χλ,µ of this module is the product
dλdµ where dλ =deg χλ, dµ =deg χµ. Taking into account multiplicities mλ,µ in (3)
we get the relation

ck,n−k(L) = Xλ⊢k

µ⊢n−k

mλ,µdλdµ.

(4)

A number of irreducible components in the decomposition of χk,n−k(L), i.e. the
sum

lk,n−k(L) = Xλ⊢k

µ⊢n−k

mλ,µ

is called the (k, n−k)-colength of L. The total graded colength lgr

n (L) is

lgr
n (L) =

n

Xk=0

lk,n−k(L).

Now let L be a ﬁnite dimensional Lie superalgebra, dim L=d. Then

cgr
n (L) ≤ dn

(5)

4

Duˇsan Repovˇs and Mikhail Zaicev

by the results of [2] (see also [4]). On the other hand, there exists a polynomial ϕ
such that

lgr
n ≤ ϕ(n)

(6)

for all n=1, 2, ... as it was mentioned in [11]. Note also that mλ,µ 6=0 in (3) only if
λ⊢k, µ⊢n−k are partitions with at most d components, that is λ=(λ1, ..., λp), µ=
(µ1, ..., µq) and p, q≤d=dim L.

Since all partitions under our consideration are of the height at most d, we will
use the following agreement. If say, λ is a partition of k with p<d components then
we will write λ=(λ1, ..., λd) anyway, assuming that λp+1 =...=λd=0.

For studying asymptotic behaviour of codimensions it is convenient to use the
following function deﬁned on partitions. Let ν be a partition of m, ν =(ν1, ..., νd).
We introduce the following function of ν:

Φ(ν) =

1

ν1

.

νd
m

(cid:0) ν1
m(cid:1)

m ...(cid:0) νd
m(cid:1)

The values Φ(ν)m and dν =deg χν are very close in the following sense.

Lemma 2.1. [8, Lemma 1] Let m≥100. Then

Φ(ν)m
md2+d ≤ dν ≤ mΦ(ν)m.

Function Φ has also the following useful property. Let ν and ρ be two partitions
of m with the corresponding Young diagrams Dν, Dρ. We say that Dρ is obtained
from Dν by pushing down one box if there exist 1≤i<j ≤d such that ρi =νi−1, ρj =
νj +1 and ρt =νt for all remaining 1≤t≤d.

Lemma 2.2. (see [8, Lemma 3], [16, Lemma 2]) Let Dρ be obtained from Dν

by pushing down one box. Then Φ(ρ)≥Φ(ν).

3. Existence of graded PI-exponents

Throughout this section let L=L0⊕L1 be a ﬁnite dimensional simple Lie su-

peralgebra, dim L=d. Then by (5) its upper graded PI-exponent exists,

a = expgr(L) = lim sup
n→∞

nqcgr

n (L).

Note that the even component L0 of L is not solvable since L is simple (see [13,
Chapter 3, §2, Proposition 2]).

We shall need the following fact.

Remark 3.1. Let G be a non-solvable ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra over a ﬁeld
F of characteristic zero. Then the ordinary PI-exponent of G exists and is an integer
not less than 2.

Proof. It is known that cn(G) is either polynomially bounded or it grows ex-
ponentially not slower that 2n (see [10]). The ﬁrst option is possible only if G is
solvable. On the other hand exp(G) always exists and is an integer [14] therefore
we are done.
✷

By the previous remark Pn,0(L)&2n asymptotically and then

a ≥ 2.

The following lemma is the key technical step in the proof of our main result.

Lemma 3.2. For any ε>0 and any δ>0 there exists an increasing sequence

of positive integers n0, n1, ... such that

(i)
(ii) nq+1 −nq ≤n0+d.

npcgr

n (L)>(1−δ)(a−ε) for all n=nq, q=1, 2, ...,

Proof. Fix ε, δ>0. Since a is an upper limit there exist inﬁnitely many indices

n0 such that

n0 (L) > (a−ε)n0.
cgr

Fixing one of n0 we can ﬁnd an integer 0≤k0≤n0 such that

k0(cid:19)ck0,n0−k0 (L) >

(see (2)). Relation (6) shows that

mλ,µ ≤ ϕ(n)

Xλ⊢k

µ⊢n−k

for any 0≤k≤n where mλ,µ are taken from (3). Then (4) implies the existence of
partitions λ⊢k0, µ⊢n0−k0 such that

k0(cid:19)dλdµ >
(cid:18)n0

2n0ϕ(n0)

(a−ε)n0.

(9)

The latter inequality means that there exists a multilinear polynomial

f = f (x1, ..., xk0 , y1, ..., yn0−k0 ) ∈ Pk0,n0−k0

6

Duˇsan Repovˇs and Mikhail Zaicev

such that F [Sk0 ×Sn0−k0 ]f is an irreducible F [Sk0 ×Sn0−k0 ]-submodule Pk0,n0−k0
with the character χλ,µ and f 6∈Idgr(L).
In particular, there exist a1, ..., ak0 ∈
L0, b1, ..., bn0−k0 ∈L1 such that

A = f (a1, ..., ak0 , b1, ..., bn0−k0 ) 6= 0

in L. First we will show how to ﬁnd n1, k1 which are approximately equal to
2n0, 2k0, respectively, satisfying the same inequality as (8).

Since L is simple and A6=0 the ideal generated by A coincides with L. Clearly,
every simple Lie superalgebra is centerless. Hence one can ﬁnd c1, ..., cd1 ∈L0∪L1
such that

[A, c1, ..., cd1, A] 6= 0

and d1 ≤d−1. Here we use the left-normed notation [[a, b], c]=[a, b, c] for nonasso-
ciative products. It follows that a polynomial

[f1, z1, ..., zd1, f2] = g2 ∈ P2k0+p,2n0−2k0+r,

p+r = d1,

is also a non-identity of L where z1, ..., zd1 ∈X ∪Y are even or odd variables, whereas
f1 and f2 are copies of f written on disjoint sets of indeterminates,

f1 = f (x1

Consider the S2k0 ×S2n0−2k0-action on P2k0+p,2n0−2k0+r where S2k0 acts on
x1
1, ..., x1
. Denote by
k0

follows from Richardson-Littlewood rule that

more boxes of D2λ. Similarly, ρ is either equal to 2µ or ρ is obtained from 2µ by
pushing down one or more boxes of D2µ. Then by Lemma 2.2 we have

Φ(ν) ≥ Φ(2λ) = Φ(λ), Φ(ρ) ≥ Φ(2µ) = Φ(µ).

By Lemma 2.1 and (9) we have

Now we present the lower bound for binomial coeﬃcients in terms of function Φ.
Clearly, the pair (k, n−k) is a two-component partition of n if k≥n−k. Otherwise
(n−k, k) is a partition of n. Since x−xy−y =y−yx−x for all x, y ≥0, x+y =1, we will
use the notation Φ( k
n ) in both cases k≥n−k or n−k≥k. Then it easily follows
from the Stirling formula that

by virtue of (10).

Recall that we have constructed earlier a multilinear polynomial g2=[f1, z1, ..., zd1, f2]

which is not a graded identity of L and f1, f2 are copies of f . Applying the same
procedure we can construct a non-identity of the type

gq = [gq−1, w1, ..., wdq−1 , fq]

of total degree nq−1 =nq−2+n0+w1+...+wdq−1 where dq−1 ≤d and fq is again a
copy of f for all q≥2.

As in the case q=2 the F [Sqk0 ×Sqn0−qk0 ]-submodule of Pk,n−k(L) (where
n=nq−1=qn0+p′, k=kq−1 =qk0 +p′′) contains an irreducible summand with the
character χν,ρ where ν ⊢qk0, ρ⊢qn0−qk0, Φ(ν)≥Φ(λ), Φ(ρ)≥Φ(µ). Moreover, for
n=nq−1 we have

by Lemma 2.1 and the inequality (11). Now it follows from (12) that

. The second inequality nq+1 −nq ≤n0+d follows
from the construction of the sequence n0, n1, ..., and we have thus completed the
proof.
✷

Now we are ready to prove the main result of the paper.

Theorem 3.3. Let L be a ﬁnite dimensional simple Lie superalgebra over a

ﬁeld of characteristic zero. Then its graded PI-exponent

expgr(L) = lim
n→∞

nqcgr

n (L)

exists an is less than or equal to d=dim L.

Proof. First note that, given a multilinear polynomial h=h(x1, ..., xk, y1, ..., yn−k)∈

Pk,n−k, the linear span M of all its values in L is a L0-module since

[h, z] =Xi
+Xj

h(x1, ..., [xi, z], ..., xk, y1, ..., yn−k)

h(x1, ..., xk, y1, ..., [yj, z], ..., yn−k)

for any z ∈L(X, Y )0. Hence M L16=0 in L and 0≡[h, w] is not an identity of L for
odd variable w as soon as h6∈Idgr(L). It follows that

ck,n−k+1(L) ≥ ck,n−k(L)

Fix arbitrary small ε, δ>0. By Lemma 3.2 there exists an increasing se-
quence nq, q=1, 2, ... , such that cgr
n (L)>((1−δ)(a−ε))n for all n=nq, q=0, 1, ... ,
and nq+1 −nq ≤n0+d. Denote b=(1−δ)(a−ε) and take an arbitrary nq <n<nq+1.
Then cgr
nq (L) and n−nq ≤n0+d. Referring to (7) we may assume that b>1.
Then bnq ≥bn·b−(n0+d) and

n (L)≥cgr

n (L) ≥ (b1−
cgr

n0+d

n )n

for all nq ≤n≤nq+1 and all q=0, 1, ... , that is for all suﬃciently large n. The latter
inequality means that

lim inf
n→∞

n (L) ≥ (1−δ)b = (1−δ)2(a−ε).

nqcgr

Since ε, δ were chosen to be arbitrary, we have thus completed the proof of the
theorem.
