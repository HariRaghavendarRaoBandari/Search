DRAGOS GHIOCA AND HEXI YE

Abstract. In the moduli space MPd of degree d polynomials, special subvarieties are
those cut out by critical orbit relations, and then special points are the post-critically
ﬁnite polynomials.
It was conjectured that in MPd, subvarieties containing a Zariski-
dense set of special points are exactly these special subvarieties. In this article, we prove
the ﬁrst non-trivial case for this conjecture: the case d = 3.

1. Introduction

Our main result is the proof of the ﬁrst important case of the Dynamical Andr´e-Oort
Conjecture (posed by Baker and DeMarco [BD13]); see Theorem 1.2 for a more precise
version, which also includes a Bogomolov-type statement for our result.

Theorem 1.1. In the moduli space of cubic polynomials, the irreducible subvarieties con-
taining a Zariski-dense set of post-critically ﬁnite points are exactly those cut out by critical
orbit relations.

We describe next the background for both our result and for the Dynamical Andr´e-Oort
Conjecture. Given a variety X, a subvariety V ⊂ X, and given a family Y of subvarieties
Y ⊆ X, the principle of unlikely intersections predicts that

V ∩

[Y ∈Y

dim(Y )<codim(V )

Y

is not Zariski dense in V , unless V satisﬁes some rigid geometric property mirroring the
varieties contained in Y. Special cases of this principle of unlikely intersections in arithmetic
geometry are the Bombieri-Masser-Zannier [BMZ99], the Pink-Zilber and the Andr´e-Oort
conjectures; for a comprehensive discussion, see the beautiful book of Zannier [Zan12].
Motivated by a version of the Pink-Zilber Conjecture for semiabelian schemes, Masser and
Zannier (see [MZ10, MZ12]) proved that in a non-constant elliptic family Et parametrized
by t ∈ C, for any two sections {Pt}t and {Qt}t, if there exist inﬁnitely many t ∈ C such
that both Pt and Qt are torsion points on Et, then the two sections are linearly dependent.
The results of Masser-Zannier [MZ10, MZ12] have natural dynamical reformulations using
the Latt´es maps associated to the elliptic curves in the family {Et}. More generally, one
can consider the following problem: given a curve C deﬁned over C, given a family of
rational functions ft ∈ C(z) parametrized by the points t ∈ C(C), and given a, b : C −→ P1,

then one expects that there exist inﬁnitely many t ∈ C(C) such that both a(t) and b(t)
are preperiodic under the action of ft if and only if a and b are dynamically related with
respect to the family {ft} in a precise manner. The ﬁrst result in this direction, for a
family ft which was not induced by the endomorphism of an algebraic group was proven by
Baker and DeMarco [BD11]. They answered a question of Zannier, thus showing that for
an integer d ≥ 2, and for two complex numbers a and b, if there exist inﬁnitely many t ∈ C
such that both a and b are preperiodic under the action of z 7→ zd + t, then ad = bd. Several
new results followed (see [GHT12, BD13, GHT15, GKN16, GKNY]), but still the question
stated above remains open in its full generality; especially, it is particularly diﬃcult to treat
the case when C is an arbitrary curve, even when dealing with families of polynomials. For
example, in [GHT15] (which is one of the very few articles treating the case when C 6= P1),
the family of rational functions must have exactly one degenerate point on C and also
the family {ft} must satisfy additional technical conditions.
In [GKNY], the parameter
curve is arbitrary, but the result holds only for families of unicritical polynomials, which is
again quite restrictive. In this article, we release all the restrictions on the curve C, which
parametrizes a family of cubic polynomials. The dynamics of cubic polynomials is already
signiﬁcantly more involved than the dynamics of unicritical polynomials, and therefore our
analysis is signiﬁcantly more involved than in the article [GKNY].

In [BD13], Baker and DeMarco posed a very general question for families of dynamical
systems, which is motivated by the classical Andr´e-Oort conjecture. As a dynamical ana-
logue to the classical Andr´e-Oort Conjecture, Baker and DeMarco’s question asks that if a
subvariety V of the moduli space of rational maps of given degree contains a Zariski dense
set of post-critically ﬁnite points, then V itself is cut out by critical orbit relations, i.e., the
critical points of the rational functions in the family V are related dynamically (see condi-
tion (2) in Theorem 1.2; for more details, see [BD13]). We recall that a rational function f
is post-critically ﬁnite (PCF) if each critical point of f is preperiodic. Also, we recall the
classical notation and deﬁnition from algebraic dynamics that for a rational function f , its
n-th iterate is denoted by f n, and that a point c is preperiodic if and only if there exist
integers 0 ≤ m < n such that f m(c) = f n(c).

In this article we prove the ﬁrst case of the Dynamical Andr´e-Oort Conjecture (posed by
Baker and DeMarco [BD13]), solving completely their conjecture in the moduli space MP3
of cubic polynomials. Furthermore, we obtain a Bogomolov-type statement for our result,
i.e., the condition that a curve C ⊂ MP3 contains inﬁnitely many post-critically ﬁnite points
can be relaxed to asking that C contains inﬁnitely many points of small critical height. We
recall that for a polynomial f ∈ Q[z] of degree d ≥ 2, the canonical height of a point c ∈ Q
is equal to

(1.1)

ˆhf (c) := lim
n→∞

h(f n(c))

dn

,

where h(·) is the usual Weil height; for more details on the canonical height we refer the
reader to the article of Call and Silverman [CS93]. Then for a polynomial f ∈ Q[z] of degree

THE DYNAMICAL ANDR´E-OORT CONJECTURE FOR CUBIC POLYNOMIALS

3

d ≥ 2, we deﬁne the critical height of a polynomial be

(1.2)

ˆhcrit(f ) :=

d−1

Xi=1

ˆhf (ci),

where the ci’s are the critical points of f (other than ∞). Clearly, f ∈ Q[z] is post-critically
ﬁnite if and only if ˆhcrit(f ) = 0.

Theorem 1.2. Let C ⊂ C2 be an irreducible curve and let fa,b(z) = z3 − 3a2z + b; then the
two critical points of fa,b(z) are ±a. The following statements are equivalent:

(1) there are inﬁnitely many (a, b) ∈ C with fa,b being post-critically ﬁnite.
(2) C is the line in C2 given by the equation b = 0, or C is an irreducible component of

a curve deﬁned by one of the following equations:
(i) f n
(ii) f n
(iii) f n

a,b(a) = f m
a,b(−a) = f m
a,b(a) = f m

a,b(−a) for some n, m ≥ 0.

a,b(a) for some n > m ≥ 0; or

a,b(−a) for some n > m ≥ 0; or

(3) C is deﬁned over Q, and there is sequence of non-repeating points (an, bn) ∈ C(Q)

with limn→∞ ˆhcrit(fan,bn) = 0.

For the case b = 0, the two critical points ±a and also their orbits are related by σ(z) =
−z, where σ is the unique symmetry of the Julia set of fa,0 with fa,0 ◦ σ = σ ◦ fa,0. We
observe that condition (1) easily yields condition (3) in Theorem 1.2 since each post-critical
point in MP3 corresponds to a polynomial with algebraic coeﬃcients, and furthermore (as
shown in [CS93]), a point is preperiodic if and only if its canonical height equals 0. Also,
a curve of the form (2) as in the conclusion of Theorem 1.2 contains inﬁnitely many PCF
points. Therefore, the diﬃculty in Theorem 1.2 lies with proving that it is only curves
cut out by orbit relations which contain an inﬁnite sequence of points of critical height
converging to 0.

A key ingredient of our article (and also of all of the articles previously mentioned dealing
with the problem of unlikely intersection in algebraic dynamics) is the arithmetic equidis-
tribution of small points on an algebraic variety (in the case of P1, see [BR06, FRL06], in
the general case of curves, see [CL06, Thu], while for arbitrary varieties, see [Yua08]). One
of the signiﬁcant technical diﬃculties of this article is to show the equidistribution of prepe-
riodic parameters for a marked critical point of cubic polynomials on an arbitrary curve
C, not necessarily containing inﬁnitely PCF points. Precisely, it is delicate to prove the
continuity of potential functions of the bifurcation measures at inﬁnity points, especially
when the bifurcation locus is not compact. Moreover, because the sets S±\S±
0 in (2.3) can
be nonempty, unlike all of the previous articles on this theme, we cannot obtain the desired
metrized line bundle from a uniform limit of semi-positive metrics on the same line bundle.
See Remark 4.5 for the following result.

Theorem 1.3. Let C be an irreducible plane curve deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K, such
that ±a is not persistently preperiodic for fa,b on C. The set of preperiodic parameters

Preper± := {t ∈ C : ±a(t) is preperiodic for fa(t),b(t)}

4

DRAGOS GHIOCA AND HEXI YE

is equidistributed with respect to bifurcation measure µ±. More precisely, for any sequence
of non-repeating points tn ∈ Preper+, the discrete probability measures

µn =

1

| Gal(K/K) · tn| Xt∈Gal(K/K)·tn

δt

converge weakly to the normalized measure µ+/µ+(C); similarly for Preper− and µ−/µ−(C).

Outline of the article. Using the arithmetic equidistribution theorem [CL06, Yua08] we
show that preperiodic parameters for a marked critical point equidistribute on the curve
with respect to the bifurcation measure; see Theorem 4.4. Assuming there exist inﬁnitely
many points (a, b) on the plane curve C such that z3 − 3a2z + b is PCF, then the potential
(escape-rate) functions for the bifurcation measures (with respect to the starting points
±a) are proportional to each other; see Corollary 4.6. Finally, using the classiﬁcation
of Medvedev-Scanlon [MS14] for invariant plane curves under the coordinatewise action
of polynomials, we derive a polynomial relation between the critical points of the cubic
polynomial; see Theorem 5.1.

2. Dynamics of cubic polynomials

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce the moduli space MP3 of cubic polynomials, and then

study the dynamics of the two critical points of the cubic polynomials.

2.1. Moduli space of cubic polynomials. Let f : C → C be a polynomial of degree
d ≥ 2. Two polynomials f and g are conjugate to each other if there is an aﬃne map
A(z) = az + b with f = A−1 ◦ g ◦ A. The moduli space MPd of polynomials consists of
conjugacy classes [f ] of polynomials of d ≥ 2, and MPd is an aﬃne space of dimension d − 1.
Moreover, it is well known that PCF points in MPd are countable and Zariski-dense; in
particular, each PCF polynomial has coeﬃcients in Q.

In this article, we focus mainly on the moduli space MP3 ≃ C2 of degree three polyno-

mials. Each cubic polynomial can be conjugate to a monic and centred polynomial, i.e.

fa,b(z) := z3 − 3a2z + b

with two critical points ±a (counted with multiplicity). Two polynomials fa1,b1, fa2,b2 of
such form are in the same conjugacy class if and only if a1 = ±a2 and b1 = ±b2. Hence
the map from MPcm
3 ≃ C2 to MP3, given by fa,b → [fa,b] is a 4-to-1 map with ramiﬁcation
when a = 0 or b = 0. The two critical points of polynomials fa,b ∈ MPcm
3 have been marked
as ±a, so we call MPcm
the moduli space of cubic polynomials with marked critical points.

As +a and −a share lots of properties under the iteration of fa,b, we focus on the study of
the iterates of +a.

2.2. Order of poles. Let C be an irreducible curve in C2. By abuse of notation, we also
denote by C the normalization of its Zariski closure in P2; hence we view C also as a smooth
a,b(a), which is a rational map C −→ P1; also, cn can be viewed
projective curve. Let cn := f n
as a polynomial in the two rational maps a, b : C −→ P1. Finally, we note that not both a
and b are constant on C.

Lemma 2.1. On C, the marked critical point +a is persistently preperiodic under fa,b, if
and only if the degree of cn ∈ C(C) is uniformly bounded for n ≥ 1.

Proof. See [Bak09] and also [Dem]; note that the family of polynomials z3 − 3a2z + b is not
isotrivial since noth both a and b are constant functions in C(C).
(cid:3)

Let t0 ∈ C(C) which is a pole of either a or b on the smooth projective curve C. Note
that since not both a and b are constant on C, then there must exist such a pole t0 ∈ C.
Let γa := − ordt0 a, γb := − ordt0 b and

(2.1)

γmax := max{3γa, γb} > 0, and γn := − ordt0 cn.

Lemma 2.2. For a point t0 ∈ C with γmax > 0, we have

• if γmax < 3γn0 for some n0 ≥ 1, then for all n ≥ n0, γn = 3n−n0 · γn0. In particular,

if limt→t0 2a3(t)/b(t) 6= 1, then γn = 3n−1 · γmax.

• if limn→∞ γn 6= ∞, then γb = 3γa and γn = γa for all n ≥ 1.

Proof. From the fact that

(2.2)

cn+1 = fa,b(cn) = c3

n − 3a2cn + b,

it is clear that if 3γn > γmax then γn+1 = 3γn. Consequently, if 3γn0 > γmax, then
γn = 3n−n0 · γn0. When limt→t0 2a3(t)/b(t) 6= 1, γ1 = − ordt0(b − 2a3) = γmax, hence
γn = 3n−1 · γmax for all n ≥ 1.

Now suppose that limn→∞ γn 6= ∞. From the above analysis we get limt→t0 2a3(t)/b(t) =
1 and then γb = 3γa = γmax. Moreover, we have γn ≤ γa for all n. If there is some n1 with
γn1 < γa, then from equation (2.2), γn1+1 = γmax. Let n0 = n1 + 1, then 3γn0 > γmax and
consequently γn = 3n−n0·γmax would tend to inﬁnity as n → ∞, which is a contradiction. (cid:3)
From the behaviour of the order of poles in Lemma 2.2, we deﬁne the following sets in

the smooth projective curve C

(2.3)

γn = ∞}

S+ := {t0 ∈ C|γmax > 0} and S+

0 := {t0 ∈ C| lim
n→∞
0 is subset of S+, and similarly we can deﬁne S−

It is clear that S+
0 ⊂ S− ⊂ C for the marked
critical point −a. Since all the poles of cn ∈ C(C) are in S+, then Lemma 2.1 yields the
following result.

Lemma 2.3. The marked critical point +a (resp., −a) is persistently preperiodic under fa,b
on C, if and only if S+

0 (resp., S−

0 ) is empty.

6

2.3. Escape-rate function and bifurcation. For the marked critical points ±a, the
escape-rate functions G± are given by

(2.4)

G±(a, b) := lim
n→∞

1
3n log+ |f n

a,b(±a)|,

for (a, b) ∈ C2, where log+ |z| := max{log |z|, 0}. In the above formula, the convergence
is local and uniform on C2; see the proof of Lemma 3.2. Then the escape-rate functions
G+(a, b) are continuous and plurisubharmonic on C2, and then they are subharmonic when
restricted on an irreducible curve C ⊂ C2. The escape-rate function G±(a, b) ≥ 0 with
equality if and only if the iterates f n
a,b(±a) of the critical point ±a do not tend to inﬁnity
as n tends to inﬁnity.

The bifurcation measures µ± on C corresponding to marked critical points ±a are given

by

(2.5)

µ± := ddcG±.

The bifurcation locus Bif ± for marked critical points ±a is the set of parameters on C ⊂ C2,
such that

{f n

a(t),b(t)(±a(t))}n≥1

is not a normal family on any small neighbourhood of such parameters. Actually, Bif ± ⊂ C
is the boundary of the parameters t ∈ C with G±(a(t), b(t)) = 0, and then from the conti-
nuity of the escape-rate functions it has G± = 0 on Bif ±. The supports of the bifurcation
measures µ± on C are exactly Bif ±. The bifurcation locus Bif on C is the union of Bif +
and Bif −, and it is the set of parameters where the dynamical system fa(t),b(t)(z) is unstable
when we perturb the parameter t.

Proposition 2.4. For any irreducible curve C ⊂ C2, there are inﬁnitely many points
(a, b) ∈ C such that +a (or −a) is preperiodic under the iteration of fa,b.

Proof. This proposition follows from Montel’s Theorem; see [Dem, Theorem 5.1].

(cid:3)

We thank Xiaoguang Wang for suggesting the proof of the following proposition.

Proposition 2.5. Let C be an irreducible curve C ⊂ C2. Suppose µ+ = rµ− on C for
some r > 0, then we have G+ = rG− on C.

Proof. As Bif ± are the supports of the µ±, then Bif = Bif + = Bif −. Since µ+ = rµ−,
G+ − rG− is harmonic on C and zero on Bif. From [Mcm00], in any small neighbourhood
of a point in Bif, we can ﬁnd a small (topological) generalized Mandelbrot set with boundary
in Bif, then G+ − rG− is zero on the boundary of this small generalized Mandelbrot set.
Hence the harmonic function G+ −rG− is zero in the interior of this generalized Mandelbrot
set. Consequently, G+ − rG− is zero everywhere on C as it is harmonic.
(cid:3)

3. A line bundle with continuous metric

In this section, we construct metrized line bundles on an irreducible curve C ⊂ MPcm
3 ,
associated to a critical point which is not persistently preperiodic on C. One of the main
goals of this section is to show that the metric on the line bundle is continuous, which is
crucial in the next section for proving the equidistribution of small points.

3.1. Continuity of the escape-rate function. We show continuity of the escape-rate
function G+ restricted on the smooth projective curve C. A uniformizer at t0 ∈ C is a
rational function u ∈ C(C) such that ordt0 u = 1.

Theorem 3.1. For the escape-rate function G+ restricted on a smooth projective curve
C\S+, we have

• G+ can be extended to a continuous subharmonic function on C\(S+\S+

0 ), and

G+ = 0 at any t0 ∈ S+\S+
0 .

• For any t0 ∈ S+

0 and u being a uniformizer at t0, the function G+ + γn

3n log |u| can be
extended to a harmonic function in a neighbourhood of t0 for any suﬃciently large
n, where γn is deﬁned in (2.1).

The proof of this theorem follows easily from Lemmas 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5. First, we mention
the following convention for our forthcoming analysis. Given t ∈ C(C), for the sake of
simplifying our notation, we will often drop the dependence on t and simply use a, b, cn
instead of a(t), b(t), cn(t).

Lemma 3.2. The sequence of functions 1

t0 ∈ C, i.e., 1
a,b(+a)| is harmonic near t0 on C. From Lemma 2.2, we can pick a
large n0, such that γn+1 = 3γn >> γmax for any n ≥ n0. As cn+1 = c3
n − 3a2 + b, inductively,
|cn(t)| >> 1 grows exponentially fast as n → ∞ for t ∈ C very close to t0. So for t near t0

It is more delicate to show the continuity of the escape-rate function G± on C crossing

t0 ∈ S+\S+

0 ⊂ C. We ﬁrst prove a result which will be used later in Lemma 3.5.

Lemma 3.4. Let γ be a positive integer, and let ˜b(t) = 2 + β1t + β2t2 + β3t3 + · · · be a
holomorphic germ at t = 0. Deﬁne

g(z) := z3 − 3z + ˜b.

Suppose zn(t) is a sequence of holomorphic germs at t = 0, satisfying

• zn+1(t) = g(zn(t))/t2γ for n ≥ 1.
• ordt=0 zn(t) = 0 for all n ≥ 1.

We write zn(t) = P∞

i=0 xn,iti for each n ≥ 1. Then there is a ﬁnite set T such that xn,i ∈ T
for all n ≥ 1 and all 0 ≤ i ≤ γ; moreover, xn,0 is a solution of the equation x3 − 3x + 2 = 0.

Proof. Let

∞

Xi=0
Since g(zn) = zn+1 · t2γ and ordt=0 zn+1(t) = 0, we have

n − 3zn + ˜b =:

g(zn(t)) = z3

αn,iti.

αi = 0,

for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2γ and αn,2γ 6= 0.

Notice that since α0 = x3
n,0 − 3xn,0 + 2 = 0, then xn,0 ∈ {1, −2}. Now suppose xn,i is unique
up to ﬁnitely many choices for all 0 ≤ i ≤ j − 1 < γ, which is true when j = 1; we prove
next that also xn,j is unique up to ﬁnitely many choices.

Suppose xn,0 6= 1, i.e., xn,0 = −2. An easy computation shows that

αn,j = xn,j(3x2

n,0 − 3) + βj + Fj(xn,0, . . . , xn,j−1) = 0

where Fj is a unique polynomial in j variables obtained from the expansion of zn(t)3.
Because xn,0 = −2, then xn,j is uniquely determined by xn,0, . . . , xn,j−1 and βj.

Now suppose xn,0 = 1. Now, if xn,i = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ j − 1, we have that

α2j = 3x2

n,j + β2j.

If j < γ, then α2j = 3x2
n,j + β2j is the constant
term of zn+1(t) which must satisfy the equation x3 − 3x + 2 = 0. In any case, xn,j is unique
up to ﬁnitely many choices.

n,j + β2j = 0. Otherwise if j = γ, α2j = 3x2

Now, if xn,i 6= 0 for some 1 ≤ i ≤ j − 1 (also under the assumption that xn,0 = 1), we let

ℓ ≥ 1 be the smallest such integer with xn,ℓ 6= 0. Then

αℓ+j = 6xn,ℓxn,j + Gj,ℓ(xn,ℓ, . . . , xn,j−1) + βℓ+j = 0

where Gj,ℓ is a unique polynomial in j − ℓ variables obtained from the expansion of zn(t)3
(also taking into account that xn,0 = 1 and that xn,i = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ − 1). Hence xn,j is
also uniquely determined up to ﬁnitely many choices. By induction, for 0 ≤ i ≤ γ, we get
that xn,i is uniquely determined by ˜b up to ﬁnitely many choices.

Proof. From Lemma 2.3, γn = γa > 0 for all n, then the convergence statement is indepen-
dent on the choice of uniformizer u. For a suitable choice of the uniformizer and also for a
suitable analytic parameterization of a neighborhood of t0 ∈ C, we can assume that

t0 = 0, u(t) = t, a(t) = t−γa, b(t) = β0t−3γa + β1t−3γa+1 + β2t−3γa+2 + · · ·

and then cn(t) = f n

a(t),b(t)(a(t)). From Lemma 2.3, ordt=0 cn(t) = −γa for all n and

2a3(t)/b(t) = 1 = 2/β0 and thus β0 = 2.

The statement of this Lemma is equivalent to the statement that the sequence

1
3n log+ |tγacn(t)|

converges locally uniformly in a neighbourhood of t = 0 as n → ∞. Also, by Lemma 3.2,
3n log+ |tγa cn(t)| converges locally uniformly for t 6= 0. As log+ |tγa ci(t)| is always non-

negative, to prove this lemma, it suﬃces to show that there exists a sequence of positive
real numbers rn shrinking to zero as n → ∞, such that

Since ordt=0 cn(t) = −γa, the Taylor series of cn(t) can be written as

cn(t) = xn,0t−γa + xn,1t−γa+1 + xn,2t−γa+2 · · · .

For simplicity, we let

˜cn(t) := tγacn(t) = xn,0 + xn,1t + xn,2t2 + · · · .

As cn+1 = c3

Let r0 be a positive real number less than 1 such that if |t| ≤ r0 we have

(3.2)

|˜b(t)| < 3.

From Lemma 3.4, we know that there exists a ﬁnite set S such that xn,i ∈ S for each
n ≥ 1 and each 0 ≤ i ≤ γa; moreover, one has |xn,0| < 3. So, at the expense of replacing r0
by a smaller positive real number, we may also assume that if |t| ≤ r0, then

3.2. Metrized line bundle. Let L be a line bundle of a projective curve C. A metric k · k
on L is a collections of norms on L(t), one for each t ∈ C, such that for a section s

kα · s(t)k := |α|ks(t)k

for all constants α. The metric k · k is said to be continuous, if ks(t)k varies continuously as
we vary t locally. All metrics considered in this article are continuous. A continuous metric
k · k on L is said to be semi-positive if, locally log ks(t)k−1 is a subharmonic function for
any non vanishing holomorphic section s, and the curvature of this metric is given by

(3.9)

c1(L) = ddc log ks(t)k−1,

which can be viewed as a measure on C. It is clear the curvature does not depend on the
choice of the section s.

We work on the curve where the marked critical point is not persistently prepeiodic.

4. Equidistribution of small points

In this section, we show that the parameters, at which the marked critical point is
preperiodic are equidistributed on C with respect to the bifurcation measure of the marked
critical point.

4.1. Height functions. Let K be a number ﬁeld and let K be its algebraic closure. It is
well known that K is naturally equipped with a set ΩK of pairwise inequivalent nontrivial
absolute values, together with positive integers Nv for each v ∈ ΩK such that

• for each α ∈ K ∗, we have |α|v = 1 for all but ﬁnitely many places v ∈ ΩK.
• for every α ∈ K ∗, we have the product formula:

(4.1)

|α|Nv

v = 1.

Yv∈ΩK

For each v ∈ ΩK, let Kv be the completion of K at v, let K v be the algebraic closure
of Kv and let Cv denote the completion of K v. The ﬁeld Cv is algebraic closed; when v is
Archimedean, Cv ≃ C. We ﬁx an embedding of K into Cv for each v ∈ ΩK; hence we have
a ﬁxed extension of | · |v on K to K. Let f ∈ K[z] be a polynomial of degree ≥ 2. There is
a canonical height ˆhf on K (see also (1.1)), which is given by

(4.2)

ˆhf (x) :=

1

[K(x) : Q]

lim

n→∞ Xy∈Gal(K/K)·x Xv∈ΩK

Nv ·

log+ |f n(y)|v

dn

where Gal(K/K) · x is Galois orbit of x in K. As proven in [CS93], for any x ∈ K, we
have that ˆhf (x) ≥ 0 with equality if and only if x preperiodic under the iteration of f .
Counted with multiplicity, a degree d ≥ 2 polynomial f has exactly d − 1 critical points. As
introduced by Silverman, the critical height ˆhcrit of a polynomial is given by the sum of the
canonical heights of its (d − 1) critical points (see (1.2)). Clearly, ˆhcrit(f ) ≥ 0 with equality
if and only if f is PCF.

4.2. Arithmetic equidistribution theorem. Let X be an irreducible projective curve
deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K, and L be an ample line bundle of X. Replacing the absolute
value | · | in Section 3.2 by | · |v, we can deﬁne metrics k · kv on L corresponding to each
v ∈ Ω. Let X an
be the analytic space associated to X(Cv). When v is Archimedean,
Cv
X an
≃ X(C). For Archimedean v, a continuous metric k · kv on a line bundle is semi-
Cv
positive, if its curvature ddc log k · kv is non negative. For non-Archimedean place v, X an
Cv
is the Berkovich space associated X(Cv), and Chambert-Loir [CL06, CL11] constructed an
analog of curvature on X an
Cv

using methods from Berkovich spaces.

An adelic metrized line bundle

L := {L, {k · kv}v∈ΩK }

over L is a collection of metrics on L, one for each place v ∈ ΩK, satisfying certain continuity
and coherence conditions; see [Zha95a, Zha95b]. Precisely, the metric k · kv on L should be
continuous for each v ∈ ΩK. Moreover, we require that: there exists a model (X, L , e) over
the ring of integers of K inducing the given metrics for all but ﬁnitely many places v ∈ ΩK.
An adelic metrized line bundle is said to be semi-positive if the metrics are semi-positive at
all places; see [CL11] for more details.

For example, we can construct an adelic metrized line bundle from a non constant mor-
phism g : X(K) → P1(K) for an irreducible smooth projective curve X deﬁned over a
number ﬁeld K. Let

D := Xx∈X: ordx g<0

(− ordx g) · x

be the Weil divisor corresponding to the poles of g. For each v ∈ ΩK, the metric k · kv on
LD|X\D is deﬁned as

ks(x)kv := e− log+ |g|v · |ϕ(s(x))|v

for s being a section of LD|X\D and ϕ being the canonical isomorphism LD|X\D ≃ (X\D)×
Cv. This metric can be extended to the whole LD, and the extended metric is continuous
and semi-positive. The metrized line bundle LD := {LD, {k · kv}v∈ΩK } constructed this way
is adelic. The simplest one is when X = P1 and g is the identity map, i.e., we get an adelic
metrized line bundle OP1(1). For general non constant morphisms g : X → P1, it is obvious
LD ≃ g∗OP1(1).

For a semi-positive line bundle L of C, there is a height ˆhL(Y ) associated to it for each

subvariety Y of X; see [Zha95b]. In the case of points x ∈ X(K), the height is given by

(4.3)

ˆhL(x) :=

1

[K : Q] Xy∈Gal(K/K)·x Xv∈ΩK

−Nv · log ks(y)kv
| Gal(K/K) · x|

where | Gal(K/K)·x| is the number of points in the Galois orbit of x, and s is any meromor-
phic section of L with support disjoint from Gal(K/K) · x. A sequence of points xn ∈ X(K)
is said to be small if limn→∞ ˆhL(xn) = ˆhL(X). For all cases considered in this article, we
will see that ˆhL(X) is always zero.

Theorem 4.1. [CL06, Thu, Yua08] Suppose X is a projective curve over a number ﬁeld
K and L is a semi-positive adelic metrized line bundle on X with L being ample. Let {xn}
be a non-repeating sequence of points in X(K) which is small. Then for any v ∈ ΩK, the
Galois orbits of the sequence {xn} are equidistributed in the analytic space X an
with respect
Cv
to the probability measure µv = c1(L)v/ degL(X).

Here c1(L)v is the curvature of the metric on L for each place v ∈ ΩK.

We note that Thuillier [Thu] deﬁned the notion of being W 1-regular for a metric on a line
bundle at an arbitrary place v (both Archimedean and non-Archimedean); then Thuillier
[Thu, Theorem 4.3.7] proves the equidistribution theorem for points of small height with
respect to adelic, W 1-regular metrics on ample line bundles on a curve. Also, as proven
by Thuillier (we thank Laura DeMarco and Myrto Mavraki for sharing with us Thuillier’s
note), every continuous subharmonic metric is W 1-regular, and therefore Theorem 4.1 holds
for such metrics, as it is the case for the metrics we constructed on LD±
. We also thank

by employing [YZ, Proposition A.8]; Yuan and Zhang prove that the limit of semipositive
metrics is still semipositive, even when the underlying line bundles in the limit process are
not the same.

Combining Lemma 4.2 and Section 4.2, one obtains the following:

5. An algebraic relation between critical points

In this section, under certain conditions, we prove an algebraic relation of the iterated

critical points on a curve C; see Theorem 5.1.

Let K be a number ﬁeld and C ⊂ C2 is an irreducible curve deﬁned over K. Denote

c±
n := f n

a,b(±a) ∈ K(C)

Theorem 5.1. Suppose the following two conditions are satisﬁed:

• both +a and −a are not persistently preperiodic under fa,b on C.
• there is a sequence of non-repeating points tn ∈ C(K) with

Then there exist non constant polynomials P±(z) ∈ K(C)[z] with

lim
n→∞

ˆhcrit(fa(tn),b(tn)) = 0.

for all suﬃciently large n.

5.1. B¨ottcher coordinate. For each fa,b(z) = z3 − 3a2z + b there is a unique uniformized
B¨ottcher coordinate Φa,b(z), i.e., a univalent, analytic function deﬁned on a neighbourhood
of inﬁnity, which is uniquely determined by the conditions

Φa,b(fa,b(z)) = Φa,b(z)3, and Φa,b(z) = z + o(1).

Moreover, for the escape-rate function of the polynomial fa,b

we have

Ga,b(z) := lim

log |Φa,b(z)| = Ga,b(z)

for any z ∈ C with Ga,b(z) > max{Ga,b(+a), Ga,b(−a)}. Let

Φa,b(z) =: z +

From the relation Φa,b(fa,b(z)) = Φa,b(z)3, it is easy to see that αi is a polynomial of a and
b for all i ≥ 1 by induction. Moreover, let the k-th power of Φa,b(z) be written as:

The following result is implicitly used in the proof of [BD13, Lemma 5.5] and the ingre-
dients for its proof are all contained in [BD13], as it was kindly pointed out to us by Laura
DeMarco, whom we thank warmly for her help.

Lemma 5.2. We work under the above notation for the curve C and the corresponding
Φa(t),b(t) for the specialization of the B¨ottcher’s coordinate along the curve C; we also let
ft(z) := z3 −3a(t)2z +b(t) for t ∈ C(C). Let t0 ∈ S±
0 and let k ∈ N. Then for each c ∈ C(C)
with the property that − ordt0 f n

t (c(t)) → ∞, we have that

as n → ∞.

ordt0 (cid:16)Φa(t),b(t)(f n

t (c(t)))k − Pk(f n

t (c(t)))(cid:17) → ∞,

Proof. First, we know that each αk,i is a polynomial in a and b and so, specializing a and
b along the curve C we obtain that each αk,i becomes a function αk,i(t) ∈ C(C). We note
that the order of the pole of αk,i(t) at t0 grows at most polynomially fast as i → ∞ (for k
ﬁxed) (see [BD13, Lemma 5.4]).

Secondly, arguing as in the proof of Lemma 3.5, we choose a suitable analytic parametriza-
tion of a neighborhood of t0 and a suitable uniformizer u at t0 such that we may assume
t0 = 0 and u = t. Thus (from the deﬁnition of the B¨ottcher’s coordinate) we obtain that
the power series

F (t, z) := Xi≥1

αk,i(t)

zi

,

converges on open sets of C × C of the form

(5.2)

{(t, z) : |t| < s and |z| > Rt},

for any s < s0, where s0 is a given small positive real number, and |z| > Rt, where Rt is
larger than the radius of convergence for the B¨ottcher’s coordinate of the polynomial ft(z);
for example, one may take (see the proof of [BD13, Lemma 5.1])

(5.3)

Moreover, we let

Rt = O(cid:16)|t|2 min{ord0(a),ord0(b)/3}(cid:17) .

Rs := max{Rt : |t| = s}

for any s < s0; thus Rs < +∞. Also, since t0 ∈ S±
0 , at the expense of replacing s0 by a
smaller positive real number, we know that the function s 7→ Rs is decreasing on (0, s0) (see
(5.3)). Next we consider the function

(5.4)

U ℓ(t) := Xi≥1

αk,i(t)
f ℓ
t (c(t))i

,

for ℓ ∈ N, where c ∈ C(C) is a function such that limn→∞ − ord0 f n
to conclude that

t (c(t)) = ∞. Our goal is

(5.5)

ord0 U ℓ(t) = +∞.

lim
ℓ→∞

Now, since F (t, z) is analytic on open sets of the form (5.2), then the series deﬁning

F (t, z) converges uniformly on sets of the form

{t ∈ C(C) : s1 < |t| < s2} × {z : |z| > Rs1},

THE DYNAMICAL ANDR´E-OORT CONJECTURE FOR CUBIC POLYNOMIALS

19

where 0 < s1 < s2 < s0.

Fix now some s1 < s2 in the interval (0, s0). Then let ℓ ∈ N with the property that if

|t| < s2, we have that |f ℓ

t (c(t))| > Rs1. Then the series U ℓ(t) converges uniformly on

{t ∈ C(C) : s1 < |t| < s2}.

However, because both U ℓ(t) and also U ℓ

In particular, this means that the diﬀerence between U ℓ(t) and the partial sum U ℓ
n(t) which
is the sum of the ﬁrst n terms in the series (5.4) is uniformly bounded on the above annuli.
n(t) are analytic functions when |t| < s2, then
their diﬀerence is bounded by their diﬀerence on the closed set |t| = s2 (according to the
Maximum Value Theorem), which is in turn uniformly bounded (as we vary n) because of
n} converges uniformly to U ℓ when
the above uniform convergence on the annuli. So, {U ℓ
|t| < s2. Since each U ℓ
n is simply a ﬁnite
sum and each term vanishes at t0 of order depending on the order of vanishing for f ℓ
t (c(t))),
then also U ℓ(t) vanishes at 0 of high order, thus proving (5.5).
(cid:3)

n vanishes at 0 of high order (note that each U ℓ

5.2. Proof of Theorem 5.1. From the hypotheses of Theorem 5.1, by Corollary 4.6, it is
clear that for each large n0,

Let t0 ∈ S±

n (t) are in the univalent

|Φa(t),b(t)(c±

n (t))| = 3n · Ga(t),b(t)(±a(t)) = 3n · G±(a(t), b(t))

by Corollary 4.6, for all t close to t0, one has

deg(D−

n0) · |Φa(t),b(t)(c+

n (t))| = deg(D+

n0) · |Φa(t),b(t)(c−

n (t))|,

i.e., there is ζt0,n ∈ C of absolute value 1 such that

n (t)) = ζt0,n · Φ

ζt0,n = lim

In particular, this yields that ζt0,n ∈ K (because a and b are rational functions on the curve
C which is deﬁned over K). Now we want to show that for any non-Archimedean place
v ∈ ΩK, we also have |ζt0,n|v = 1. For large n, we know that for t close to t0 in the topology
determined by the non-Archimedean place v,

Then equalities (5.6) and (5.7) yield |ζt0,n|v = 1. As |ζt0,n|v = 1 for all v ∈ ΩK, we conclude
that ζt0,n a root of unity.

6. Proof of the main theorem

In this section we ﬁnish the proof of the main theorem stated in the introduction.

(cid:3)

a,b(+a) − f m1

a,b (+a) = 0 and f n2

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Notice that PCF points (a, b) ∈ C2 are the intersections of the zero
loci of f n1
a,b (−a) = 0 for some ni > mi ≥ 0 with
i = 1, 2. Because there are only countable many PCF points in MP3, all the parameters
⊂ C2. If an irreducible curve C ⊂ C2 contains a Zariski-
(a, b) with fa,b being PCF are in Q
2
, then C must be a curve deﬁned over Q. Since ˆhcrit(fa,b) ≥ 0 with
dense set of points in Q
equality if and only if fa,b is PCF, we conclude that statement (1) implies statement (3) in
the conclusion of Theorem 1.2.

a,b(−a) − f m2

2

a,b(+a) = f m

Suppose now that statement (2) holds. If one of the marked critical point is persistently
preperiodic on C, then by Proposition 2.4, there are inﬁnitely many (a, b) ∈ C with fa,b
being PCF. If f n
a,b(−a) on C for some n, m ≥ 0, then for any (a, b) ∈ C, +a
is preperiodic if and only if −a is preperiodic under fa,b. Moreover, if b = 0 on C, then
f n
a,0(−a) = −f n
a,0(+a) for all n on C, i.e., +a has ﬁnite forward orbit under fa,0 if and only
if so does −a. Hence by Proposition 2.4, in all cases there are inﬁnitely many (a, b) ∈ C
with fa,b being PCF. Therefore, statement (2) implies statement (1) in the conclusion of
Theorem 1.2.

THE DYNAMICAL ANDR´E-OORT CONJECTURE FOR CUBIC POLYNOMIALS

21

The only implication left to prove is to show that statement (3) implies statement (2)
in the conclusion of Theorem 1.2. So, suppose now that statement (3) holds. Let K be
a number ﬁeld such that C is deﬁned over K.
If one of the marked critical points ±a
is persistently preperiodic, then the second statement holds. We assume neither of the
critical points ±a is persistently preperiodic under fa,b on C. From Theorem 5.1, there
exist polynomials P±(z) ∈ K(C)[z] such that for all n ≥ n0 (for some large positive integer
n0), we have that P+(c+
n ) as functions in K(C). Consider the plane curve given
by the equation

n ) = P−(c−

{(x, y) : P+(x) − P−(y) = 0}.

n , c−

Since {(c+
n )}n≥n0 ⊂ K(C) × K(C) is an inﬁnite set lying on P+(x) − P−(y) = 0 and
invariant by the coordinatewise action of fa,b on A2, we can ﬁnd an irreducible component
of P+(x)−P−(y) = 0 containing inﬁnitely many points in {(c+
n )}n≥n0 and periodic under
(fa,b, fa,b). By [MS14, Theorem 6.24], such an irreducible component of P+(x) − P−(y) = 0
is a graph given by

n , c−

x = g(y) or y = g(x)

n1 = g(c−

for some g(z) ∈ K(C)[z] which commutes with f ℓ
a,b(z) ∈ K(C)[z] for some ℓ > 0. Without
loss of generality, we assume the curve is given x = g(y) and then c+
n1 ) for some
large positive integer n1. At all but ﬁnitely many points t ∈ C (as long as they are not poles
for the coeﬃcients of g(z) ∈ K(C)[z]), specializing g at each such point yields a polynomial
gt(z) ∈ C[z]. For t ∈ C such that a(t), b(t) 6= 0, ∞, there is no symmetry for the Julia
set Jfa(t),b(t). Since the polynomial gt(z) commutes with f ℓ
a(t),b(t)(z), we conclude that gt(z)
must be an iterate of fa(t),b(t) (see [SS95] and also [Ng15, Proposition 2.3]). Obviously, for
all but ﬁnitely many points t ∈ C, we also have that deg(gt) = deg(g). Therefore there
a,b. So if C ⊂ C2 is not the line given by
exists a nonnegative integer r such that g = f r
a = 0 or b = 0, then we can ﬁnd integers n, m ≥ 0 with f n
a,b(−a) on C. For the
case a = 0, we see f 0
(cid:3)

0,b(−0) = 0. This concludes the proof of Theorem 1.2.

a,b(+a) = f m
