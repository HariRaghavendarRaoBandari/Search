Abstract

Two triplet vectorlike quarks with hypercharges of Y = 2/3,−1/3 are embedded in the standard
model (SM). The Higgs- and Z-mediated ﬂavor changing neural currents are induced at the tree

level and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix is nonunitary. The constraints from

∆F = 2 processes and the measured CKM are investigated and discussed in detail. We ﬁnd that

the signal strength of diphoton Higgs decay can be 10% deviation from the SM prediction and

the upper limits of the branching ratios for top-quark ﬂavor changing neutral current processes
are BR(t → c(h, Z)) < (6.8, 0.48) × 10−5. To understand the single production cross sections
for exotic vectorlike quarks X±5/3 and Y∓4/3, we throughly analyze any single possible channel
through qiq′j annihilations in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV. It is found that the production cross
sections for X5/3d, Y−4/3u, and Y4/3d channels with mX = mY = 1 TeV can be 84.3, 72.3, and
157.8 fb, respectively, when the constraints from the low energy physics and Higgs measurements
are satisﬁed. The dominant decay modes are X5/3 → (c, t)W + and Y−4/3 → (s, b)W −, and each
branching ratio can be 1/2 in our chosen scheme.

INTRODUCTION

With the discovery of the standard model (SM) Higgs in the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2]

experiments, we have taken one step further toward understanding the electroweak symmetry

breaking (EWSB) through the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) mechanism in the

scalar sector. The next mission for the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is to

explore not only the detailed properties of the SM Higgs, but also the new physics eﬀects.

Since the problems, which are concerned with the origin of neutrino mass, dark matter

(DM), and matter-antimatter asymmetry, can not be resolved in the SM, it is believed that

the SM of particle physics is an eﬀective theory at the electroweak scale. If new physics exists

at TeV scale, the LHC can detect it. Some potential events for the existence of new eﬀects

indeed are indicated by the recent ATLAS and CMS experiments. For instance, diboson

excess of V V with V = W/Z at around 2 TeV is shown by ATLAS [3] and CMS [4]; the
branching ratio (BR) for lepton ﬂavor violating Higgs decay h → µτ with a 2.4σ signiﬁcance
is presented by CMS [5]; a resonance at mass of 750 GeV in the diphoton invariant mass

spectrum is reported by ATLAS [6] and CMS [7]. Although the results are not conclusive yet,

these experimental measurements inspire theorists to speculate various eﬀects to interpret

the excesses.

Since the SM Higgs was observed, the Higgs measurements are approaching to the pre-

cision level. It becomes an important issue to uncover the physics beyond the SM through

the Higgs portal. On the other hand, the precision Higgs measurements can also give strict
bounds on the new couplings, for instance, cos(β − α) in the two-Higgs-doublet model has
been limited to be close to the decoupling limit [8], the SM with a fourth generation of chiral

fermions is disfavored [9], etc.

Although the extension of the SM with chiral fermions has been severely limited, the

constraint on the vector-like quark (VLQ) models may not have the same situation due

to the diﬀerent representations and coupling structures. Unlike the chiral fermion models,

where the appearance of chiral quarks has to accompany with the chiral leptons due to gauge

anomaly, the gauge anomaly in VLQ model is cancelled automatically. Therefore, it is not

necessary to introduce the exotic heavy leptons into the SM when the VLQs are added.

Due to the interesting properties, the phenomena of some speciﬁc VLQs at the LHC have

been investigated from theoretical viewpoint [10–18]. In experiments, the single and pair

2

production of VLQs have been also performed at ATLAS [19–26] and CMS [27–31].

Based on the SM gauge symmetry SU(2)L × U(1)Y , the representations of VLQ basically
can be any SU(2) multiplets. However, in order to consider the VLQ decays, the possible

representations of VLQ couplings to the SM quarks are singlet, doublet, and triplet. To

interpret the excesses of diboson and diphoton indicated by ATLAS and CMS, we proposed

a model that contains one Higgs singlet and two triplet VLQs with hypercharges of Y = 2/3
and Y = −1/3 [17, 18]. Since the representations of the VLQs are diﬀerent from those
of the SM quarks, the Higgs- and Z-mediated ﬂavor changing natural currents (FCNCs)

are induced at the tree level and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix is not a

unitary matrix. In earlier studies, besides the resolutions of the excesses, we focused on the

leading eﬀects, which were from the left-handed ﬂavor mixing matrices, and found that they
led to interesting contributions to top FCNCs t → q(h, Z) and the SM Higgs production
and decays.

In this study, we systematically discuss the left-handed and right-handed ﬂavor mixing

eﬀects together. We revisit the constraints and present the bounds from ∆F = 2 processes

in detail. With the values of constrained parameters, it is found that the modiﬁed top

coupling to the SM Higgs, which arises from the right-handed ﬂavor mixing, can diminish

the inﬂuence of the SM Higgs production and decay to diphoton to be around 10% and
−2%, respectively. We demonstrate how the changes of the SM CKM matrix elements
can be smeared so that the severe bounds from the current measurements of CKM matrix

elements are satisﬁed [32].

In addition to the phenomena in ﬂavor physics, we also investigate the single and pair

production of VLQs in this work. In the proposed model, the new quarks are T1,2, B1,2,
X, and Y , in which the associated electric charges in turns are 2/3, −1/3, 5/3, and −4/3.
Therefore, T1,2 and B1,2 can be regarded as top and bottom partners, respectively. Since

VLQs X and Y carry the unusual electric charges, they do not have the FCNC couplings

to the SM quarks. As a result, their single production and decays are only through charged

weak interactions. Due to top and bottom partners involving more complicated FCNC

interactions, we concentrate the study on the VLQs X and Y . It is found that the single

production cross sections of X and Y can be larger than the pair production cross sections,

which are dominant from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In order to understand this
phenomenon, we are devoted to analyzing each process qiq′j → (X, Y )qk for single production

3

of X and Y . It is found that with mX(Y ) ∼ 1 TeV, the cross sections for Xd and ¯Y d modes
can be of the order of 100 fb while the pair production cross sections are smaller by a factor

of around 2. We postpone the study of event simulation in elsewhere.

The paper is organized as follows. We establish the model, discuss the new ﬂavor mixing

eﬀects, and derive the new Higgs and gauge couplings in Sec. II. We present the constraints

from low energy and Higgs measurements in Sec. III. In the same section, we study the
implications on top-quark FCNC processes t → q(h, Z). In Sec. IV, we discuss the pair
and single production for vector-like quarks X5/3 and Y−4/3, and thoroughly analyze the
production mechanism in pp collisions. The conclusions are given in Sec. V.

II. MODEL AND FLAVOR MIXINGS

A. Model and new interactions

We extend the SM by including one real Higgs singlet and two VLTQs, where the repre-
sentations of VLTQs in SU(3)c×SU(2)L×U(1)Y gauge symmetry are chosen as (3, 3)2/3 and
(3, 3)−1/3 [17]. For suppressing the mixing between Higgs single and doublet, we impose a Z2
discrete symmetry to the scalar potential, where the scalar ﬁelds follow the transformations
S → −S and H → H under the Z2 transformation. Thus, the scalar potential is expressed
as:

V (H, S) = µ2H†H + λ1(H†H)2 + m2

SS2 + λ2S4 + λ3S2(H†H) .

We adopt the representation of H to be:

(1)

(2)

H =


1√2

G+

(v + h + iG0)
 ,

where G+ and G0 are Goldstone bosons, h is the SM Higgs ﬁeld and v is the VEV of H. The

scalar potential in Eq. (1) can not develop a non-vanished VEV for S ﬁeld when λ2,3 > 0.

Due to the Z2 symmetry, h and S do not mix at the tree level; thus mS is the mass of S,

v = p−µ2/λ1, and mh = √2λ1v ≈ 125 GeV is the mass of the SM Higgs [1, 2]. We note

that the Z2 is softly broken by other sector of Lagrangian.

The gauge invariant Yukawa couplings of VLTQs to the SM quarks, the SM Higgs doublet,

4

and the new Higgs singlet are expressed as:

VLTQ = ¯QLY1F1R ˜H + ¯QLY2F2RH + y1T r( ¯F1LF1R)S + y2T r( ¯F2LF2R)S

− LY

+ MF1T r( ¯F1LF1R) + MF2T r( ¯F2LF2R) + H.c. ,

(3)

where QL is the left-handed SM quark doublet, all ﬂavor indices are hidden, ˜H = iτ2H∗,
F1(2) is the 2 × 2 VLTQ with hypercharge 2/3(−1/3), the representations of F1,2 are:

F1 =


U1/√2

X

D1 −U1/√2

 , F2 =


D2/√2

Y

U2

−D2/√2
 ,

(4)

and under Z2 transformation F1L,2L → −F1L,2L. The electric charges of U1,2, D1,2, X and Y
are 2/3, −1/3, 5/3 and −4/3, respectively. Therefore, U1,2(D1,2) can mix with up (down)
type SM quarks. The masses of VLTQs do not originate from the electroweak symmetry

breaking. Due to the gauge symmetry, the VLTQs in the same multiplet state are degenerate

and denoted by MF1(2). Since the mass terms of VLTQs do not involve S ﬁeld and the
associated operators are dimension-3, the discrete Z2 symmetry is softly broken by MF1,2

terms. It is worth mentioning that Y1,2 result in the mixture of the SM quarks and VLTQs;

consequently, the h coupling to top-quark is modiﬁed and the h couplings to VLTQs are

induced. As a result, the SM Higgs production cross section via gluon-gluon Fusion (ggF)

and its decays will be modiﬁed.

In the next subsection, we discuss the modiﬁcations in

detail.

Next, we discuss the weak interactions of VLTQs. As usual, we write the covariant

derivative of SU(2)L × U(1)Y as:
√2(cid:0)T +W +

Dµ = ∂µ + i

g

g

µ + T −W −µ(cid:1) + i

cW (cid:0)T 3 − s2

W Q(cid:1) Zµ + ieQAµ ,

(5)

where W ±µ , Zµ and Aµ stand for the gauge bosons in the SM, g is the gauge coupling of
SU(2)L, sW (cW ) = sin θW (cos θW ), θW is the Weinberg angle, T ± = T 1±iT 2, and the charge
operator Q = T 3 + Y with Y being the hypercharge of particle. Thus, the gauge interactions

of VLTQs are written as [17]:

LV F F = −g(cid:2)(cid:0) ¯XγµU1 + ¯U1γµD1 + ¯D2γµY + ¯U2γµD2(cid:1) W +

µ + h.c.(cid:3)

− (cid:20) g

where we express the triplet VLQs to be F T
2 = (U2, D2, Y ),
diagT 3 = (1, 0,−1), diagQ1 = (5/3, 2/3,−1/3), and diagQ2 = (2/3,−1/3,−4/3). For fur-
ther understanding the weak interactions in terms of physical states, we have to investigate

1 = (X, U1, D1) and F T

the structures of ﬂavor mixings when Y1,2 eﬀects in Eq. (3) are involved.

B. Flavor mixings and Higgs-mediated FCNCs

The introduced two SU(2)L triplet VLQs contain the quarks with electric charges +2/3
and −1/3. From the new Higgs Yukawa couplings to the SM Higgs and VLTQs, the mixture
between the SM quarks and VLTQs is generated after EWSB. In order to get the physical

mass eigenstates of quarks and the new ﬂavor mixings, we have to diagonalize the mass

matrices which are composed of the SM quarks and VLTQs. With the Yukawa couplings

Y1i and Y2i (i=1-3) in Eq. (3), the quark mass terms are given by:

− Lmass = ¯qLmqqR + ¯qLYqvFR + ¯FLmF FR + H.c. ,

(7)

where qT = (u, c, t) or (d, s, b) denotes the SM up- or down-type quarks, we have chosen the
basis such that mq is a 3 × 3 diagonal matrix, FT = (U1, U2) or (D1, D2) is the VLTQ with
charge +2/3 or −1/3 , diagmF = (mF1, mF2), and
, Yd =


Y11/√2 −Y21/2

Y13/2 Y23/√2

Yu =







We do not have ¯FLqR terms due to gauge invariance. The quark mass matrices for electric
charges +2/3 and −1/3 now become 5 × 5 matrices. One can introduce the 5 × 5 unitary
matrices V q
L MqV q†R . In order
to obtain the information of V q
L,R, we consider the multiplications of mass matrices to be
RM†q MqV q†R , where MqM†q and M†q Mq are

R to diagonalize the mass matrices, namely M dia

with m†q = mq, and m†F = mF. It is clear that the oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements in MqM†q are
related to vYqmF while those in M†q Mq are vmqYq. Due to mqj , vY q
ij ≪ mFi, the unitary
matrices V q
L,R can be expanded with respect to v/mFi and mq/MmFi; at the leading order

approximation, they can be formulated as:

where χ = L, R, εεεq

are suppressed by vmq/m2

F . We ﬁnd the eﬀects of εεεq
L = vYqmF /m2
R
L are associated with v/mFi. Since the top
and bottom quarks are much heavier than other SM quarks, in this study we keep the
contributions from εu(d)

F2, and ignore other
εRij which involve the light quark masses. We use the ﬂavor mixing matrices of Eq. (10) to

R23 = vmt(b)Y u(d)

R13 = vmt(b)Y u(d)

F1 and εu(d)

13 /m2

investigate the new ﬂavor couplings of the Higgs and the weak gauge bosons below.

From the Yukawa couplings in Eq. (3), the SM Higgs couplings to the quarks in ﬂavor

space are written as:

− Lhqq = ¯q′LV qq′Rh + H.c. ,

(11)

where q′ = (u, c, t, T1, T2) or (d, s, b, B1, B2), Ti and Bi are the physical states of VLTQs and
carry the electric charges 2/3 and −1/3, respectively, V q is the mixing matrix for q-type
quark and is given by

The small eﬀects, such as mqεεεq
R/v, have been dropped. Accord-
ing to Eq. (12), the h-mediated FCNCs for the SM quarks (e.g., h-q-q′′) are proportional to

R/v, εεεq†L Yqεεεq†R /v, and εεεq†L mqεεεq

mq, q′′v/m2

F . If the mass eﬀects of the ﬁrst two-generation quarks are neglected, we have the

where u1(2) = u(c) quark, d1(2) = d(s) quark, the deﬁnition of Yq in Eq. (8) is applied,
and ζij = vYij/mFi. The Bd − ¯Bd and Bs − ¯Bs oscillations can be induced via the tree-
level Higgs-mediation in the VLTQ model. Additionally, the BRs for the ﬂavor-changing
processes t → (c, u)h, which are highly suppressed in the SM, become sizable. In addition
to the new FCNC couplings, the ﬂavor-conserving couplings are also modiﬁed to be

(14)

The modiﬁcation of Higgs coupling to top-quark will aﬀect the SM Higgs production and

decays in the pp collisions at the LHC. If we take mF1 = mF2 = 1 TeV, Yij = 1, and v = 246

GeV, the h production cross section by top-quark loop will be reduced by 9% of the SM

prediction. That is, the inﬂuence of new eﬀects can not be ignored arbitrarily.

From the ﬂavor mixing matrix in Eq. (12), we can also obtain the SM Higgs interactions

with the VLTQs as

with ξij =Pk ζikYjk = mFj /vPk ζikζjk. Since VLTQs are color triplet states in SU(3)C and

carry the color charges the same as the SM quarks, the new couplings hF F also contribute

to the h production cross section via gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) channel. We will study their
inﬂuence on the process pp → h → γγ in the numerical analysis.

C. Weak interactions of the SM quarks and VLTQs

By combining the charged weak interactions of the SM quarks with those of VLTQs in

Eq. (6), the charged current interactions of quarks can be formulated by:

LW = −

where u = (u, c, t, T1, T2) and d = (d, s, b, B1, B2) in turn are the physical up and down type
quarks, and V L(R)
CKM is the 5 × 5 Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix for left(right)-

The 3 × 3 matrix VCKM is associated with the SM CKM matrix. Since the weak isospin of

CKM are not
unitary matrices.

By using the results of Eq. (10), the CKM matrix elements for the three-generation SM

quarks are modiﬁed to be:

(V SM

CKM)ij → (VCKM)ij +

2√2

(ζ1iζ1j − ζ2iζ2j) .

(18)

CKM)ij = V SM

With Y1i, Y2i < 1 and mF1,2 = 1 TeV, the changes of the SM CKM matrix elements are
roughly estimated as (∆V SM
CKM−VCKM < 3%. As indicated by the experiments [32],
the value of 3% has the same order of magnitude as (VCKM)cb,ts and is larger than (VCKM)ub,td.
To satisfy the constraints of (VCKM)ub,td, the possible schemes are: (a) |ζ 2
ij| is less than |Vub|
the smallest CKM matrix element, (b) ζ11,21 = 0 so that (∆V SM
CKM)td = 0, and
(c) ζ11ζ13 − ζ21ζ23 = 0 which leads to (∆V SM
CKM)td = 0. Moreover, if we adopt
ζ1i = ζ2i (i =1-3), all CKM matrix elements return to the SM ones. With the leading-order

The charged weak interactions of VLTQs could be directly read from Eq. (6).

In the following we discuss the neutral weak interactions. It is known that the left-handed

and right-handed quarks in the SM are SU(2)L doublets and singlets, respectively; however,

the VLTQs are SU(2)L triplets. Since the isospin of triplet is diﬀerent from that of doublet

and singlet, in order to combine the VLTQs with the SM quarks into the same representation
in ﬂavor space, we need to rewrite the vertex structure of Z-boson, T 3 − s2
W Q, in Eq. (6)
to ﬁt the cases of doublet and singlet, such as I3 − s2
W Q where I3 = ±1/2 for doublet and
I3 = 0 for singlet. Due to the isospin diﬀerence, Z-mediated FCNCs are induced at the tree

9

level. Since the VLTQs X and Y carry the electric charge of 5/3 and −4/3, respectively,
they can not mix up with other quarks in the neutral current interactions.

In terms of weak eigenstates, we write the weak neutral current interactions in Eq. (6)

to be

where T T = (U1, U2) and BT = (D1, D2) are composed of VLTQs with electric charges of
2/3 and −1/3, respectively, F = T, B, I3 = ±1/2 for T (B), QT = 2/3, and QB = −1/3.
We succeed in expressing the Z couplings to VLTQs by using the SM Z couplings. It is

clear that the ﬁrst two terms in Eq. (20) lead to the ﬂavor-conserving couplings when the

SM quarks and VLTQs form a representation in dimension-5 ﬂavor space. Since the SM

quarks do not have the interaction structures as shown in the last three terms of Eq. (20),

as a result, FCNCs via Z-mediation are generated. Hence, the Z-boson interactions with
quarks, which carry the electric charges of 2/3 and −1/3, can be formulated as:

and (ǫd, αd) = (−1, 4).

L,R are deﬁned in Eq. (10), (ǫu, αu) = (1, 5),

Using Eq. (10) and the leading-order approximation, the new gauge couplings of Z-boson

to the SM quarks are given by:

LZqiqj = −

(23)
where qi denote the up- or down-type SM quarks, au = bd = 1, and bu = ad = √2. It can be
seen that the FCNC eﬀects can contribute to ∆F = 2 neutral meson mixings. By comparing

neutral currents are diﬀerent. It is interesting to investigate the possible schemes that can

simultaneously satisfy the constraints from CKM matrix elements and the data of neutral

III. CONSTRAINTS AND TOP-QUARK FCNCS

In this section, we discuss the constraints from low energy ∆F = 2 processes and from

the data of the SM Higgs production and decay into diphoton.

A. P − ¯P mixings

From Eqs. (13) and (23), we have known that the h- and Z-mediated FCNCs appear in
this study and contribute to the ∆F = 2 processes, such as K − ¯K and Bq − ¯Bq mixings,
where the current experimental data can give strict constraints on the free parameters. Since

the FCNC couplings in the up-type quarks are the same as those in the down-type quarks

and the hadronic eﬀects in D-meson system are dominated by unclear non-perturbative

eﬀects, therefore, we focus on ∆K = 2 and ∆B = 2 processes.

Following the notations [33, 34], the transition matrix elements for K − ¯K and Bq − ¯Bq

mixings are given by:

Since we have ignored the eﬀects of light quark masses, the h-mediated FCNC has no
contribution to K − ¯K mixing.

To constrain the parameters, we assume that the obtained ∆mP in the model should be

less than the experimental measurements. For understanding the individual inﬂuence by h-
mediation and Z-mediation, we show their constraints separately. With ∆mK = 2|ReM K
12|,
∆mBq = 2|M Bq
K − ¯K mixing :

12 |, and the inputs of Table I, we obtain the constraints as:

|2ζ13ζ12 + ζ23ζ22| < 0.26 (h) ,
√2ζ13ζ12 − ζ23ζ22| < 0.012 (Z).
|

12

By these results, we ﬁnd that the constraint from ∆mK is only a factor of 2 stronger than that

from ∆mBd. Since the ratiop∆mBd/∆mBs in experiments is very close to the Wolfenstein’s
parameter λ ≈ 0.22 [32], the diﬀerence in a factor of 0.2 between Eq. (31) and Eq. (32) can
be understood.

From the deﬁnition ζij = vYij/mFi, if we take Y13,23 ≈ 1 and mFi = 1 TeV, we have
ζ13,23 ≈ 0.25. It is interesting to understand whether the values of ζ11,21,12,22 could be the
same orders of magnitude as ζ13,23 ≈ 0.25, when the constraints of Eqs. (30), (31), and (32)
are satisﬁed simultaneously. Recalling Eq. (18), in order to avoid the constraint from the

CKM matrix elements, one of possible schemes is ζ1i = ζ2i. With this scheme, however,

Z-mediated ∆Bd will give the bound to be ǫ11,21 < 0.013. That is, it is diﬃcult to require all

values of ζij to be as large as 0.25. To obey the constraints from CKM matrix elements and
∆F = 2 process, one can adopt the modiﬁed scheme ζ11 = ζ21 ≪ 1 and ζ12(13) = ζ22(23). As a
result, the SM CKM matrix is not changed and ∆mK,Bd, by the Z-mediated eﬀects, can be
automatically small; thus, the main constraint is from ∆mBs. If we set ζ12(22) ∼ ζ13(23) = ǫ,
from Eq. (32), we get ǫ2 < 0.087 by the h-mediation and ǫ2 < 0.029 (i.e., ǫ < 0.17 ) by the

Z-mediation. Clearly, the Z-boson FCNCs give a more strong bound on ǫ.

B. Constraint from diphoton Higgs decay

The Higgs measurement usually is described by the signal strength, deﬁned as the ratio

of observation to the SM prediction and expressed as:

where f stands for the possible channels. Although vector boson fusion (VBF) can also

µf =

σ(pp → h)BR(h → f )

σ(pp → h)SMBR(h → f )SM

,

(33)

produce the SM Higgs, we only consider the ggF process because it is the dominant one.

Since the new ﬂavor mixings directly aﬀect the Higgs production and the Higgs decay to

diphoton, we concentrate on the constraint from diphoton channel (i.e., f = γγ), where
the current results measured by ATLAS and CMS are µγγ = 1.17 ± 0.27 [35] and µγγ =
1.13 ± 0.24 [36], respectively.

It has been known that the h production is dominated by the loop with heavy quark; in the

SM, the top-quark loop gives the dominant contributions. Besides the top-quark, four heavy

VLTQs T1,2 and B1,2 in the model can contribute to the Higgs production. In addition, they

also aﬀect the Higgs decay to diphoton. In order to understand their inﬂuence, we discuss

the Higgs production and decay separately. According to the couplings in Eq. (14), the

Higgs coupling to top quark is modiﬁed as:

mt

from the limit of −4/3 for mt = 174 GeV and mFi = 1 TeV are only 3% and 0.09%,
respectively. Taking A1/2 = −4/3 as a good approximation, the eﬀective interaction of hgg

Next, we discuss the modiﬁcation on the partial decay width for the decay h → γγ.

Following the notations [37], we write the partial decay width for h → γγ to be:

where Nci is the number of colors carried by the internal particle i, Q2

i is the electric charge

square of particle i, and Ai is the corresponding loop integral function. In the SM, W -loop

and top-quark loop are the main eﬀects. The loop function from W -boson contribution is:

AW (τW ) = 2 + 3τW + 3τW (2 − τW )f (τW )2 ≈ 8.34
h. The loop integral function from top-quark is A1/2, which has been
deﬁned in Eq. (36). Since the introduced VLTQs are spin-1/2 particles, the resulted loop

(41)

integral function is also A1/2 but with diﬀerent argument τFi = 4m2

neglected. As discussed earlier, it is a good approximation to use the limit τt,Fi → ∞, i.e.,
A1/2 = −4/3. Using this limit and taking ǫ12,13,22,23 ∼ ǫ, the ratio of Γh
γγ to the SM result
can be simpliﬁed as:

With ǫ = 0.17, we ﬁnd that the deviation of Γh

γγ from the SM result is only −2%.

Since the inﬂuence of new physics on the Higgs width is small, the result in Eq. (43) can
be regarded as the result of BR(h → γγ)/BR(h → γγ)SM. According to our analysis, if we
take ǫ . 0.17, the signal strength for diphoton Higgs decay deﬁned in Eq. (33) is µγγ . 10%.

The result is consistent with the current measurements at the LHC.

C. Rare t → qh and t → qZ decays

It is known that the FCNCs in the SM arise from the charged weak interactions through

the loop eﬀects; even though, not all of them are sizable and detectable in the experiments,
such as the rare top-quark decays t → uih and t → uiZ (ui = u, c), in which the SM
results are highly suppressed. As discussed earlier, the tree-level h- and Z-meduated FCNC

couplings to the SM quarks occur in this model. Following Eqs. (13) and (23), the partial
decay rates for t → uih and t → uiZ are derived as:
t(cid:19)2

Taking ζ12 = ζ22 and ζ13 = ζ23, the constraints from ∆F = 2 processes in Eqs. (30), (31)

and (32) can be directly applied. As a result, we get:

BR(t → (u, c)h) < (0.08, 6.8) × 10−5 ,
BR(t → (u, c)Z) < (0.19, 4.8) × 10−6 .

(46)

The current upper limits from ATLAS and CMS for t → c(u)h are 0.46(0.45)% [38] and
0.47(0.42)% [39] and for t → uiZ are 7 × 10−4 [40] and 5 × 10−4[41], respectively. It can be

16

seen that the results for the decays t → c(h, Z) in Eq. (46) are still smaller than the current
data by two orders of magnitude.

IV. SINGLE PRODUCTION OF X±5/3 AND Y∓4/3

The introduced VLQs in the model are T1,2, B1,2, X and Y , where the ﬁrst two VLQs can

be regarded as the partners of up- and down-type quarks that carry the electric charges of

Qu = 2/3 and Qd = 1/3, respectively; however, the exotic particles X and Y in turn carry
the electric charges of 5/3 and −4/3. Since the couplings of X and Y to the SM particles
are QCD and charged weak interactions, in order to clearly understand the production

mechanism for the VLQs, we focus the studies on the VLQs X and Y . To present the
production of VLQs and its anti-particles, we use the notations of X±5/3 and Y∓4/3, where
the indices stand for the electric charge of particle.

The production cross section for a VLQ pair is lower than that for a single VLQ when the

mass of VLQ is as heavy as 1 TeV; therefore, in this study we discuss the single production
of X±5/3 and Y∓4/3 in detail. The relevant free parameters are the masses of VLQs and ζij.
In the numerical analysis, we adopt:

mX = mY = mF ∈ [750, 1200]GeV; ζ11 = ζ21 = 0.02;
ζ12 = ζ13 = ζ22 = ζ23 = ζ ∈ [0.1, 0.3].

(47)

These taken values are close to the constraints from the low energy physics and from the

Higgs measurements. We separately discuss the QCD and electroweak production pro-
cesses below. To calculate the production cross section in pp collision at √s = 13 TeV,
we implement our model in CalcHEP [42] and adopt CTEQ6L parton distribution functions

(PDFs) [43].

A. QCD production channels

Since the X±5/3 and Y∓4/3 are color triplet fermions, their couplings to the gluons are
the same as the SM quarks. In this subsection, we discuss the VLQ production through the

QCD processes. To compare with the single production, we present the VLQ-pair production

cross section with respect to mF in Table II, where the QCD and electroweak eﬀects have

17

been included and Q = X5/3, Y−4/3. Since QCD dominates the pair production, the Q-pair
production cross section only depends on the mass of VLQ.

As mentioned earlier, the relevant couplings of X and Y to the SM particles are strong

and charged weak interactions; therefore, the production of a single VLQ in the ﬁnal state
via QCD eﬀects is gq → QW , where q is the possible up (down) type quarks while Q =
X5/3(Y−4/3) and W = W −(W +). The Feynman diagrams are sketched in Fig. 1. With
ζ = 0.2 and ζ11,21 = 0.02, we show the production cross section for QW process with respect

to mF in Table III. Since the values of CP-conjugate processes are close to the results in

Table III, we do not show them repeatedly.

From the results of Table III, it can be seen that except Y−4/3W + mode with mY = 800
GeV that can have the cross section of O(1) fb, the others are below or far below 1 fb. In

18

addition, σ(pp → X5/3W −) is smaller than σ(pp → Y−4/3W +) by a factor of two. These
results can be understood as follows. The quark q in the gq scattering is dominated by a

sea quark, i.e., c-quark or s-quark. As known that the PDF of a sea quark is smaller than

that of a valence quark when the momentum fraction is roughly larger than 0.1. Therefore,

the single production cross section of VLQ via gq channel typically is small. Although the

initial state for X/Y production can be the valence u/d quark, the small production cross
sections result from the small couplings taken as ζ11,21 ≪ 1. If one uses ζ11,21 = 1 instead,
the production cross section for mF = 1 TeV then can reach 75 fb, which is few factors

larger than the case of pair production. By the same reasons, the production cross sections

for the CP-conjugate processes are the same as those shown in Table III. The factor of two
diﬀerence between X5/3W − and Y−4/3W + actually arises from the diﬀerent PDFs in the
initial quarks, where the averaged c-quark PDF for the former channel is a factor of around

two smaller than s-quark PDF for the latter channel. In sum, we conclude that the single

production cross section of VLQ via gq channel is far below 1 fb when the heavy quark mass

approaches to 1 TeV.

B. Electroweak production channels

One usually expects that the production of a heavy quark is dominated by the strong

interactions. As we showed before, the heavy quark-pair production cross section for mF = 1
TeV at √s = 13 TeV is around 20 fb while the single production of a heavy quark is far below
1 fb. In this subsection, we thoroughly investigate the single production of X and Y through

the electroweak interactions. We demonstrate that the single VLQ production cross section

by electroweak interactions is much larger larger than that for VLQ-pair production. Since
the initial quarks for producing X±5/3 and Y∓4/3 are diﬀerent, we discuss their situations
separately.

1. X±5/3+jet processes

A X5/3 accompanied with a quark jet can be produced by W -mediated channels in the
pp collisions, that is, pp → X5/3q, where q can be anti-up-type quarks ¯ui = (¯u, ¯c, ¯t) or down-
type quarks di = (d, s, b). Since the involved initial quarks for q = ¯ui and q = di ﬁnal states

19

are diﬀerent, in order to understand the contributions from diﬀerent situations, we discuss

them separately. Additionally, due to the diﬀerence in PDF between u(d)-quark and its
anti-quark, we distinguish the CP-conjugate mode X−5/3 ¯q from X5/3q mode.

We ﬁrst study the X5/3 ¯ui processes. The possible Feynman diagrams are sketched in

Fig. 2, where the left(right)-handed one is s(t)-channel q′ ¯q′′ annihilation diagrams. Since

the oﬀ-diagonal Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements are small,
in the
numerical estimations, we ignore their contributions. Due to ζ11 ≪ 1, the processes involved
the vertex u-X-W are small and their values are similar to those shown in Table III. Since

the coupling in the s-channel q′ ¯q′′ annihilation to X5/3 ¯ui is the SM vertex u-d-W , unlike the

case for the single VLQ production, the coupling from the valence u-quark is not suppressed.

FIG. 2: S-channel (left) and t-channel (right) q′ ¯q′′ annihilation Feynman diagrams for the pro-

We display the production cross sections for X5/3 ¯ui as a function of mX in Fig. 3(a),

where √s = 13 TeV, ζ11 = 0.02, and ζ = 0.2 are used.
It can be seen clearly that the
relative magnitude of each production cross section is σ(X5/3 ¯u) > σ(X5/3¯c) ≫ σ(X5/3¯t). For
mX = 1 TeV, we get σ(X5/3 ¯u) = 6.5 fb, σ(X5/3¯c) = 3.5 fb, and σ(X5/3¯t) = 0.3 fb. We take

mX = 1 TeV as the example to understand these results. The typical value of cross section
for mX = 1 TeV from s-channel u ¯d → X5/3(¯c, ¯t) is 0.1 fb; however, it becomes 10−3 fb for
c¯s → X5/3¯t, where the suppressed cross section originates from the two sea quarks in the
initial state. Accordingly, we can conclude that the production cross section arisen from

the s-channel is far less than 1 fb. The results above 1 fb indeed are from the t-channel
annihilations. For instance, the production cross section for t-channel process c ¯d → X5/3 ¯u
is 4.5 fb. We note that since ¯b and b have smaller PDFs, the cross section for t-channel
c¯b → X5/3¯t is of the order of 0.1 fb.

It is interesting to explore the diﬀerence between the CP-conjugate modes. With the
same values of parameters, we present X−5/3ui production cross section via W -mediation as

TeV, where plot (a) is for X5/3(¯u, ¯c, ¯t) processes while plot (b) is for X−5/3(u, c, t). ζ11 = 0.02 and
ζ = 0.2 are applied.

a function of mX in Fig. 3(b). It is apparent that σ(X−5/3u) in pp collisions is much larger
than σ(X5/3 ¯u), while the others are close to their CP-conjugate modes. For mX = 1 TeV,
we have σ(X−5/3u) = 28.3 fb, σ(X−5/3c) = 2.4 fb, and σ(X−5/3t) = 0.1 fb. The enhanced
cross section for X−5/3u mode originates from the valence d-quark, where the associated
PDF is larger, the process is dictated by t-channel d¯c → X−5/3u, and the corresponding
cross section is 27.6 fb. From the results, we see clearly that the production cross section
for X−5/3u mode can be as large as that for VLQ-pair production.

In addition to X5/3 ¯ui and X−5/3ui modes, where the net electric charges in the ﬁnal state
¯di ( di = d, s) modes, that are electrical charges
are ±1, we ﬁnd that X5/3di and X−5/3
of ±4/3, are allowed and important. Since the net charges of the initial quarks have to be
±4/3, the possible combinations of quarks are uu, uc, cc, and their anti-particles. Therefore,
only t-channel annihilation diagrams are involved. If the initial quarks are composed of ¯ui¯uj,

since they are sea quarks, we expect that the resulted cross sections should be similar to the

cases for X5/3 ¯ui. However, the situations for uiuj are diﬀerent. For instance, the processes
for X5/3d can be classiﬁed by (i) uu → X5/3d and (ii) cu → X5/3d. Although process (i)
depends on the small coupling ζ11, the two large u-quark PDFs compensate the suppression.

For process (ii), although it involves a sea quark c in the initial state, the related coupling is

ζ and one u-quark PDF can enhance the contributions. With mX = 1 TeV and ζ = 0.2, we

21

get σ(uu → X5/3d) = 14.5 fb and σ(uc → X5/3d) = 69.8 fb. Clearly, the production cross
section for X5/3d mode can be over 80 fb. Since the situation of X5/3s mode is similar to

the X5/3c mode, we expect that its production cross section is of the order of few fb. We
¯di modes as a function of mX in
present the production cross sections for X5/3di and X−5/3
Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. It can be seen that X5/3d production cross section can be

over 100 fb if the mass of LVQ is lighter than 950 GeV. Obviously, the result is over the

VLQ-pair production.

2. Y∓4/3+jet processes

We discuss the single production of Y−4/3 in this subsection. Similar to the production
of X±5/3, a Y−4/3 accompanied with a quark jet can be generated through the W -mediated
processes and is described by pp → Y−4/3 ¯q, where ¯q = ¯di = ( ¯d, ¯s, ¯b) or ¯q = ui = (u, c, t).
Since the involved PDFs for the CP-conjugate modes are diﬀerent, we discuss Y−4/3 ¯q and
Y4/3q modes separately.

We ﬁrst discuss the Y−4/3

¯di ﬁnal states, in which the W -mediated processes are through

the s- and t-channel di ¯uj annihilations; the corresponding Feynman diagrams are shown in
Fig. 5. Based on the analysis for the single X±5/3 production, one expects that t-channel
annihilation diagrams are dominant. With mY = 1 TeV, ζ21 = 0.02, and ζ = 0.2, we

illustrate the production cross section for s-channel to be σ(d¯u → Y−4/3(¯s, ¯b)) = 3.8 × 10−2
¯b) = 1.4×10−3 fb when the initial state involves two sea
fb; however, it becomes σ(s¯c → Y−4/3
¯di processes are electrical charge of −1 modes and the initial state mostly
quarks. Since Y−4/3
¯d and
involves two sea quarks, the t-channel production cross sections for (s, b)¯u → Y−4/3
s¯c → Y−4/3¯s are (6.9, 2.3) fb. Although the t-channel d(¯u, ¯c) → Y−4/3( ¯d, ¯s) processes have
one valence d-quark in the initial state, due to the small coupling ζ21 ≪ 1, their cross sections
¯di
are suppressed to be (0.68, 0.27) fb. We present the production cross sections for Y−4/3
modes as a function of mY in Fig. 6(a), where √s = 13 TeV, ζ21 = 0.02, and ζ = 0.2 are
used. For mY = 1 TeV, we have σ(Y−4/3 ¯d) = 10 fb, σ(Y−4/3¯s) = 3.3 fb, and σ(Y−4/3¯b) = 0.04
fb. All these results can be understood by the same discussions for pp → X5/3 ¯ui.

It is interesting to examine the processes pp → Y4/3di which is the CP-conjugate modes

¯di. As mentioned earlier, the t-channel σ(s¯u → Y−4/3d) with sea quarks in the initial
¯d, where the

of Y−4/3
state can be of the order of 10 fb; since the CP-conjugate process is u¯s → Y4/3
initial state involves a valence u-quark, the cross section for such mode should be much larger
than Y−4/3d. With mY = 1 TeV, ζ21 = 0.02, and ζ = 0.2, we obtain σ(u¯s → Y4/3d) = 111
fb and σ(u¯b → Y4/3d) = 45 fb. The production cross section for Y4/3d mode is one order of
¯d mode. Since the production mechanism for Y4/3(s, b) modes is
magnitude larger than Y−4/3
similar to their CP-conjugate modes, it is expected that the results are close to Y−4/3(¯s, ¯b).
In order to clearly see the numerical results, we plot the production cross sections for Y4/3di
as a function of mY in Fig. 6(b), where √s = 13 TeV, ζ21 = 0.02, and ζ = 0.2 are applied.
¯di and Y4/3di in which the net charges of ﬁnal states are ∓1, we can have the
single Y∓4/3 associated with a ui/¯ui quark in the ﬁnal state, which the net charges are ∓2/3.
The single Y∓4/3 production channels thus are from didj and ¯di ¯dj scatterings. Since the
initial states ¯di ¯dj are the sea quarks, it can be expected that the resultant production cross
¯di. On the other hand, the production
sections should be similar to the processes pp → Y−4/3
channels from didj scatterings can have larger cross sections. For instance, with mY = 1 TeV
and ζ = 0.2, we get σ(sd → Y−4/3u) = 49 fb and σ(bd → Y−3/4u) = 19 fb. In addition, even
the process dd → Y−4/3u involves the coupling ζ21 = 0.02, its contribution can still reach
σ(dd → Y−4/3u) = 3.6 fb. As to the Y−4/3c mode, it is similar to the result of Y4/3s. We
¯b modes which are from the s-channel, Y−4/3t
should mention that unlike the Y4/3b and Y−4/3
and Y4/3¯t are mainly from the t-channel sb and ¯s¯b annihilations, respectively. Although the
cross sections are still small, they are larger than those for Y4/3b and Y−4/3¯b modes. In sum,
we have σ(pp → Y−4/3u) = 72 fb, σ(pp → Y−4/3c) = 6.9 fb, and σ(pp → Y−4/3t) = 0.4 fb. We
numerically present the production cross sections for Y4/3¯ui and Y4/3ui modes as a function
of mY in Fig. 7, where √s = 13 TeV, ζ21 = 0.02, and ζ = 0.2 are applied.

For further understanding the ζ dependence of the single X and Y production processes,

we show the production cross section as a function of ζ in Fig. 8, where we use mX = mY =
900 GeV, the plot (a) is for X5/3d (solid line) and X−5/3u (dashed line), and the plot (b) is
for Y−4/3u (solid line) and Y4/3d (dashed line). With the scheme ζ12 ≈ ζ13 ≈ ζ22 ≈ ζ23, the
main decay channels for X5/3 and Y4/3 in turn are X5/3 → W +(t, c) and Y4/3 → W +(¯s, ¯b)
and each BR is almost equal to 1/2. Hence, the favorable channels to search for the single

production of VLQs X and Y are

V. CONCLUSION

We have studied the phenomenology of which two triplet vectorlike quarks with Y =
2/3,−1/3 and a Higgs singlet are embedded in the SM. Due to the isospin of vectorlike
quarks being diﬀerent from the SM quarks, it is a common knowledge that the Higgs- and

Z-mediated FCNCs are generated at the tree level and the new CKM matrix becomes a

nonunitary matrix. We ﬁnd that the modiﬁcations of the CKM matrix elements coupling to

the SM quarks can be smeared out if two triplet vectorlike quarks are introduced and the

scheme ζ1i = ζ2i is adopted, where ζij = vYij/mF are the parameters from ﬂavor mixings.

Although the tree-level FCNCs can not be removed, it is found that when the constraints
from ∆F = 2 processes are applied, the upper limits of branching ratios for t → c(h, Z)
decays are (6.8, 0.48) × 10−5, in which the results are two orders of magnitude smaller than

the current experimental bounds. With the values of constrained parameters, we examine

the inﬂuence of the model on the SM Higgs production and its diphoton decay; we ﬁnd
that σ(pp → h) and BR(h → γγ) can have 13% and −2% deviations from the SM results,
respectively. As a result, the signal strength for pp → h → γγ is thus changed by 10%.

The main purpose of this work is to explore the single production of exotic vectorlike
quarks X and Y in the pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV. We give a detailed analysis for each
possible qiq′j scattering, where qi and q′j stand for the possible initial quarks; and it is found
that the contributions of s-channel annihilations are much smaller than those of t-channel

annihilations. From this study, we comprehend the contribution of each subprocess to

the production cross section of a speciﬁc vectorlike quark. The interesting production
channels are X5/3d, Y−4/3u, and Y4/3d, where the corresponding production cross sections
for mX = mY = 1 TeV in tune are 84.3, 72.3, and 157.8 fb. From our analysis, it is clear

to see that the single production cross sections of the vectorlike quarks are much larger

than the pair production cross sections, which are through QCD processes. The dominant
decay modes of the vectorlike quarks are X5/3 → (c, t)W + and Y−4/3 → (s, b)W −, and each
branching ratio can be 1/2 in our chosen scheme.
