Low temperature ultrasound velocity measurements are presented on the frustrated spin system
SrDy2O4 that allow us to deﬁne high resolution phase diagrams with the magnetic ﬁeld applied
along all three principal axes. For H||b, a region of ﬁeld-induced long range order is delimited by a
dome of ﬁrst-order phase transitions. An unusual magnetization process is observed with signiﬁcant
irreversibility at very low temperatures when passing between the low-ﬁeld spin liquid phase and the
long range ordered phase which we attribute to large energy barriers. For H||c, the system appears
to remain eﬀectively one-dimensional, exhibiting two transitions as a function of magnetic ﬁeld, but
no ﬁnite-temperature long range order.

An attractive feature of rare-earth magnets is the pos-
sibility to grow isostructural materials with many diﬀer-
ent rare-earth ions, each with distinct total angular mo-
mentum, anisotropy and quantum ﬂuctuations, providing
a wealth of diverse physical phenomena for a given lattice
symmetry. While the pyrochlores are undoubtedly the
best studied set of isostructural rare-earth materials [1],
a new group of materials with the formula AR2O4 has
recently become a popular ﬁeld of study [2]. The A ion
can be either Sr or Ba and the rare-earth ion is highly
ﬂexible with materials containing Ho [3], Dy [4], Er [5],
and Yb [6] having recently been studied. When viewed
along the c-axis, these materials have a honeycomb struc-
ture (see Fig. 1). However, from the point of view of
interactions they are likely best represented by a model
of two inequivalent sets of frustrated zigzag spin chains
with weaker interchain coupling [2].

One of the most intriguing materials in this class is
SrDy2O4 which,
in zero-ﬁeld, shows no indications of
long-range order (LRO) down to very low temperatures,
suggesting a spin liquid ground state, an intriguing state
of matter that supports signiﬁcant quantum entangle-
ment and exotic excitations [7]. In magnetic ﬁeld, how-
ever, thermodynamic measurements have shown evidence
of magnetic order [4, 9].
In particular, with H||b, the
magnetization appears to show a plateau from 0.5 to
1.5 T and partial saturation above 2.5 T. The plateau
is found to be roughy 1/3 of the partially saturated mo-
ment, suggesting that an up-up-down (↑↑↓) state is sta-
bilized by quantum ﬂuctuations [9].
Inelastic neutron
scattering measurements and crystal ﬁeld calculations [3]
have allowed for a determination of crystal ﬁeld levels in
SrHo2O4 and SrDy2O4 and indicate that the easy axis
of site 1 (the red chains) is the c-direction whereas the
easy axis of site 2 (the blue chains) is along b (see Fig. 1).
Based on bond lengths in the zig-zag chains, they may
be well described by a highly frustrated 1d anisotropic

In this Letter we present a study of SrDy2O4 using
ultrasound velocity measurements down to low tempera-
tures, an order of magnitude below what was previously
obtained. The sound velocity shows precise anomalies at
magnetic phase transitions, providing a high-resolution
magnetic phase diagram. Notably, we ﬁnd that the eﬀec-
tive dimensionality of the system (with respect to mag-
netic degrees of freedom) depends heavily on the direc-
tion of the applied magnetic ﬁeld. We have also care-
fully studied the eﬀect of ﬁeld-history, making it possible
to identify ﬁrst-order phase transitions, glassy dynam-
ics and strong irreversibility when passing between spin
liquid and ordered phases.

technique, was cut with faces perpendicular to the or-
thorhombic axes a, b and c (2.26 × 2.36 × 2.30 mm3).
Transverse piezoelectric transducers were glued on oppo-
site faces of the crystal, oriented such that shear waves
were propagated along the c-axis (along the chains) with
polarization in the a-direction. An ultrasonic interferom-
eter was used to measure the velocity of the ﬁrst elastic
transmitted pulse (at 92 MHz) which is proportional to
the elastic constant C55. The absolute velocity is found
by time of ﬂight to be 1440 ± 15 m/s. The sample was
cooled to 50 mK in a dilution refrigerator and magnetic
ﬁelds were applied along the a-, b- and c-axes. Relative
changes in velocity, ∆v/v, primarily reﬂect changes in the
restoring forces between atoms due to magneto-elastic
coupling which provides a highly sensitive probe of the
magnetization and magnetic order parameters [10, 11].
The C44 elastic constant was also measured on a diﬀer-
ent sample of SrDy2O4 and gave essentially the same
results, although with overall larger variations (stronger
magnetoelastic coupling).

H||b (blue chains / Dy2) – We begin with a discus-
sion of the richest phase diagram, that is for H||b where
the ﬁeld is primarily inﬂuencing the spins on the blue
chains (Dy2). Anomalies in the sound velocity are pri-
marily associated with changes in the square of the mag-
netization, M 2
2b, the development of an order parameter,
S 2, and changes in low frequency spin ﬂuctuations. Rel-
ative changes in velocity are shown as a function of mag-
netic ﬁeld for various temperatures in Fig. 2(a). Below

2

∼ 1.5 K, we typically observe three separate anomalies
where the slope of v(B) changes sign.

The ﬁrst two critical ﬁelds, Hb1 and Hb2 are found to
converge as the temperature is raised, forming a dome,
inside of which is likely a long range ordered (LRO) mag-
netic state. Clear hysteresis loops indicate that the dome
of LRO is delimited by ﬁrst-order phase transitions. This
can be seen in Fig. 2a where solid (dotted) lines indicate
increasing (decreasing) ﬁeld. Temperature scans, shown
in Fig. 2b at various values of Hb, are also consistent with
a dome of hysteretic, ﬁrst-order phase transitions. As a
function of temperature the lattice is found to soften at
the transition (i.e. the velocity is reduced), indicating a
negative coupling to the square of the order parameter
S 2. Hence, in the phase diagram of Fig. 3c, we have used
a minimum in ∂v/∂H to signal the onset of the order pa-
rameter at Hb1 and the maximum of ∂v/∂H to signal the
disappearance of the order parameter at Hb2. Given that
the magnetization is close to 1/3 of the saturated value in
the region under the dome shown in Fig. 3 [9], this may
be an ↑↑↓ phase on chains formed by Dy2 ions with an
easy axis anisotropy pointing along the b-axis (see blue
chains in Fig. 1). Such a 1/3 magnetization plateau can
be seen in simulations of the highly frustrated 1d ANNNI
model that is thought to apply to this material [12].

Although we associate anomalies at Hb1 and Hb2 with
true phase transitions, the origin of the maximum ob-
served in the sound velocity at around Hb3 ≃ 2.5 T seems
quite diﬀerent (Fig. 2a) in that it is quickly smeared
out with increasing temperature. Consequently, we at-
tribute this maximum to a crossover at which the blue
chain spins reach their full polarization as shown in
magnetization data for H//b [9]. Despite full polar-
ization of Dy2 (blue chains) above Hb3, we nonetheless
observe that ∆v/v ∝ −H 2
In order to account for
b .
this signiﬁcant ﬁeld dependence of the velocity above
Hb3, we must invoke a negative magnetoelastic cou-
pling with spins on the other chain (red chain / Dy1),
which in this regime continue to show a small magne-
tization that is linear in magnetic ﬁeld, as measured in
Ref. [9]. The leading-order ﬁeld dependence of the ve-
locity of transverse acoustic waves then simply reduces
to ∆v/v = kM 2
1bH 2 [13] where k is a coupling
constant and χ1b is the constant magnetic susceptibility
of spins on the red chains (Dy1) with the ﬁeld along the
b-axis.

1b = kχ2

This material’s phase diagram shows several regions of
hysteresis with a complex ﬁeld-history dependence.
In
order to address this complication carefully we have per-
formed temperature scans using three diﬀerent protocols:
1) cooling in ﬁeld (FC), 2) warming after ﬁeld cooling
(FCW) and 3) warming after zero-ﬁeld cooling (ZFCW).
The FC and FCW curves primarily show the hystere-
sis associated with supercooling at the ﬁrst-order phase
transition, as shown in Fig. 2b. In Fig. 2c, we instead ob-
serve a strong diﬀerence between FCW and ZFCW curves

FIG. 3: Surface plots of the ﬁeld derivative of sound velocity, (∂v/∂H)/v as a function of Hb and temperature for (a) increasing
ﬁeld and (b) decreasing ﬁeld. In addition to a shift of the position of the dome of LRO (due to hysteresis at 1st order phase
transitions), the “up” curves demonstrate a great deal of increased structure in the vicinity of Hb1, with this line of transitions
appearing to bifurcate into three separate transitions. (c) Phase diagram for H||b. Blue circles are the two initial jumps seen
when raising the magnetic ﬁeld. Black triangles present the ﬁrst-order phase transitions that delimit what is likely the ↑↑↓
LRO phase, with the orientation of the triangles indicating the direction of ﬁeld or temperature sweeps. Red squares illustrate
the crossover to full polarization (of Dy2). The hatched region roughly shows where slow (glassy) dynamics are observed.

only below ∼ 500 mK. It seems that cooling the sample
in the liquid phase at zero ﬁeld locks in a signiﬁcant level
of disorder. On increasing the ﬁeld into the LRO phase,
some disorder remains frozen in, probably in the form of
domains.

Strangely, below ∼ 250 mK, the transition at Hb2
(Fig. 2a) no longer shows hysteresis and the same anoma-
lies are seen in both cooling and warming curves. The
values of critical ﬁelds in this region therefore become
somewhat ambiguous. The most peculiar behavior is seen
in the ﬁeld-history dependence of the low-temperature
phase transition at Hb1 which becomes very complex be-
low ∼ 300 mK. For decreasing magnetic ﬁeld only one
anomaly is observed at 0.36 T (we deﬁne the transition as
the minimum in ∂v/∂H). However, for increasing mag-
netic ﬁeld, Hb1 appears to bifurcate into three separate
anomalies which, at 100 mK, are found at 0.27, 0.44 and
0.91 T. This is evident in the surface plot of Fig. 3a,
where we show (∂v/∂H)/v, as well as in the phase dia-
gram presented in Fig. 3c.

This unusual irreversibility can likely be explained by
the slow dynamics that are observed at low-ﬁeld, for ex-
ample as a FC-ZFC splitting in magnetization measure-
ments [9]. We also ﬁnd a diﬀerence between cooling and
warming curves which indicate slow dynamics in the liq-
uid phase, but this diﬀerence depends on the sweep rate
and does not show a pronounced dip in velocity at a spe-
ciﬁc temperature as would be expected for a spin glass
transition [14]. Likely, this system can best be described
as a “classical” spin liquid, with slow dynamics and min-
imal quantum ﬂuctuations.

Similar to spin ice, SrDy2O4 in zero-ﬁeld may progres-
sively freeze into one of many possible degenerate disor-

dered ground states with relatively short-range correla-
tions. Many rare-earth Ising systems like this one can
even manifest extremely slow spin dynamics in paramag-
netic [15, 16] and spin liquid [17, 18] phases due to very
small quantum tunnelling matrix elements, although this
is not universally true (see for instance Ref. [19]) . When
the magnetic ﬁeld is increased, one selects a particular
ground state (likely an ↑↑↓ state), but the transition from
the disordered liquid state to LRO is a violent one as sig-
niﬁcant energy barriers must be overcome in order to re-
conﬁgure small domains into extended order. This tran-
sition is evidently achieved in three distinct steps. Only
once the ﬁeld reaches close to 1 T, much higher than the
0.5 T transition that is measured at slightly higher tem-
perature, is the system ﬁnally able to achieve LRO. Even
then, a domain structure must persist as evidenced by the
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between ZFCW and FCW curves in
Fig. 1c. On the other hand, when decreasing the mag-
netic ﬁeld across Hb1, the transition is able to proceed
much more smoothly as the ↑↑↓ conﬁguration may be
much closer to one of the many possible, short-range or-
dered ground states permissible in the spin liquid phase
and in this case a single anomaly is observed. Fennell
et al. [3] have demonstrated 1-dimensional, short-range,
↑↑↓↓ correlations in this phase, and it would be useful
to explore theoretically how the system passes between
such a short-range ordered state and ↑↑↓ order.

Strong irreversibility in ﬁeld-sweeps has also been ob-
served in spin ice, the most famous example of a classical
spin liquid. Speciﬁcally, with the ﬁeld along the [111] di-
rection, a strong irreversibility was seen well below any
phase transitions with magnetization [20], ultrasound ve-
locity [21], and thermal conductivity [22] measurements.

Again, signiﬁcant energy barriers, in this case connected
to hopping magnetic monopoles [23, 24], make it diﬃcult
to increase the level of order in the system, leading to
avalanches and irreversibility.

H||c (red chains / Dy1) – Relative sound velocity
is shown as a function of H||c in Fig. 4(a). These ﬁeld
sweeps show qualitatively similar behavior to those with
H||b including two hysteretic anomalies and a maximum
in the velocity. Quantitatively speaking, these transitions
occur at lower ﬁeld values: Hc1 = 0.295 (0.595) T and
Hc2 = 0.821 (1.07) T for decreasing (increasing) ﬁeld at
50 mK. Saturation of the red chain magnetization gives
a very pronounced maximum at Hc3 ≃ 1.3T , as opposed
to Hb3 ≃ 2.4 T. Above this point we again have a neg-
ative H 2 background.
In this case, we speculate that
the background comes from the uniform magnetization
of Dy2, M2c, which should be roughly linear for this ﬁeld
direction.

With increasing temperature, the Hc1 and Hc2 anoma-
lies disappear much more quickly than their counterparts
for H||b. The striking diﬀerence in the H||c data is the
lack of phase transitions as a function of temperature. In
other words, there does not appear to be a dome of long
range order for H||c. In particular, this can be seen in the
temperature sweep at 0.75 T in Fig. 4b (in between the
critical ﬁelds) which is quite featureless. Thus it appears
that the Dy1 sites (red chains) never develop true LRO
at a ﬁnite temperature, although at the lowest temper-
atures we may be approaching a zero-temperature LRO
that would be consistent with a strongly anisotropic 1d
system. It appears that due to some details of the sys-
tem’s Hamiltonian and crystal ﬁeld levels, the eﬀective
dimensionality of this material varies with ﬁeld direction.
Clear 3-dimensional LRO is found when H||b, but the
system remains eﬀectively 1-dimensional when H||c.

It is important to highlight the fact that signiﬁcant
slow (glassy) dynamics persist below 500 mK for essen-
tially all values of magnetic ﬁeld when H||c. This glassi-
ness becomes particularly evident above 1.5 T, as can be
seen in the hysteresis loops in Fig. 4, but this progressive
spin freezing does not develop at a sharp glass transition.
This is a point that deserves further research with tech-
niques like ac susceptibility or muon spin rotation (µSR)
which are better suited to studying slow spin dynamics.
H||a – When the magnetic ﬁeld is applied in the a-
direction, the obtained curves are relatively featureless,
as shown in the supplemental information document [31],
apart from some weak hysteresis at the lowest temper-
atures. ∆v/v initially increases as H 2
indicating a
a,
quadratic coupling to a linear Ma(Ha). This is not sur-
prising given that the a-direction is a hard axis for both
types of spin. Some levelling oﬀ (beginning of saturation)
is noticed by 3 T, as is the case in the magnetization
data [9].

There is a certain degree of similarity between this ma-
terial and others in the SrLn2O4 family in that one of-

ten encounters very diﬀerent physics on the two diﬀerent
rare-earth sites (the red or the blue chains) [25]. With the
exception of SrYb2O4 [6], LRO occurs on at most one of
the rare-earth sites in all members of this family of ma-
terials
In SrHo2O4, for instance, the red chains
appear to develop fairly conventional long range N´eel or-
der (↑↓↑↓) whereas the blue chains develop only short
range order with a double-N´eel (↑↑↓↓) conﬁguration [27].
In both SrHo2O4 and SrDy2O4, the crystal ﬁeld energy
gap is larger for site 2 (blue chains) than for site 1 (red
chains) [3] and Wen et al. [27] argue that this leads to
slower dynamics in the blue chains. It is proposed that
this slow dynamics, as well as the topological nature of
domain walls in the double-N´eel state, leads to the blue
chains being easily quenched into a state of short range
order (SRO). The red chains have much faster dynamics
(especially in the Ho compound) and therefore do not so
easily loose ergodicity and do ﬁnd a state of LRO [27].
This same logic evidently does not apply to SrDy2O4,
however, which has a rather similar crystal ﬁeld scheme,
but only seems to show LRO on the blue chains under
applied ﬁeld H||b. A similar coexistence of LRO and
SRO has been observed in SrEr2O4 [5], BaNd2O4 shows
LRO of the double-N´eel (↑↑↓↓) variety on only one of
the chains [28] and SrTb2O4 has incommensurate order
on only one of the chains [29].Two other systems in the
family, BaTb2O4 [26] and SrTm2O4 [30], do not show

any magnetic order in zero-ﬁeld but their ﬁeld-induced
phase diagrams have not yet been explored.

In conclusion, this work has elaborated the ﬁrst de-
tailed phase diagrams of SrDy2O4 for magnetic ﬁeld
along the b- and c-directions and for temperatures down
to 50 mK (Fig. 3c and Fig. 4c). Our results are consistent
with those of magnetization [9] and speciﬁc heat [4] mea-
surements, but extend to lower temperatures and pro-
vide much higher resolution. Whereas a clear dome of
long range order is found for H||b for spins with a b-axis
anisotropy (blue chains), the red chains appear to remain
disordered for all magnetic ﬁelds, with LRO only possi-
bly occurring in the zero-temperature limit when H||c.
This suggests a diﬀerence in eﬀective dimensionality de-
pending on the direction in which the magnetic ﬁeld is
applied. A very strong irreversibility at the ﬁrst critical
ﬁeld value seems to be consistent with a transition into or
out of a disordered spin liquid with large energy barriers
impeding ordering of the spins as the ﬁeld is increased.

Finally, using the highly sensitive ultrasound veloc-
ity technique, we have shown that there is no ordering
anomaly in zero-ﬁeld down to 50 mK, therefore provid-
ing strong evidence of frustration and a likely spin liquid
ground state. Previous thermodynamic measurements
have only reached ∼ 500 mK, which is just slightly lower
than the ordering transition in SrHo2O4 at ∼ 600 mK,
for instance [4, 9]. Slow dynamics suggest a “classical”
spin liquid with only short range correlations [3] along
with large energy barriers and a progressive slowing of
spin dynamics, similar to spin ice for example [17]. This
material’s rich behavior provides an interesting challenge
for theory. It remains to be seen whether the origin of
the spin liquid phase and the unusual transitions to LRO
can be understood within the context of fairly simple 1d
ANNNI models or whether additional complications like
the long-range dipolar interaction, interchain couplings
and additional crystal ﬁeld levels are essential to model-
ing the magnetism in SrDy2O4.
