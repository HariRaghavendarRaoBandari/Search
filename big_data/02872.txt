We study the interplay of topological bottlenecks and energetic barriers to equilibration in a
Coulomb spin liquid where a short-range energetic coupling between defects charged under an emer-
gent gauge ﬁeld supplements their entropic long-range Coulomb interaction. This work is motivated
by the prevalence of memory eﬀects observed across a wide range of geometrically frustrated mag-
netic materials, possibly including the spontaneous Hall eﬀect observed in Pr2Ir2O7. Our model
is canonical spin-ice model on the pyrochlore lattice, where farther-neighbour spin couplings give
rise to a nearest-neighbor interaction between topological defects which can easily be chosen to be
“unnatural” or not, i.e. attractive or repulsive between defects of equal gauge charge. Among the
novel features of this model are the following. After applying a ﬁeld quench, a rich dynamical ap-
proach to equilibrium emerges, dominated by multi-scale energy barriers responsible for long-lived
magnetization plateaux. These even allow for the metastability of a “fragmented” spin liquid, an
elusive regime where partial order co-exists with a spin liquid. Perhaps most strikingly, the attrac-
tion produces clusters of defects whose stability is due to a combination of energetic barriers for
their break-up and proximity of opposite charges along with an entropic barrier generated by the
topological requirement of annihilating a defect only together with an oppositely charged counter-
part. These clusters may take the form of a “jellyﬁsh” spin texture, comprising an arrangement
of same-sign gauge-charges, centered on a hexagonal ring with branches of arbitrary length. The
ring carries a clockwise or counterclockwise circular ﬂow of magnetisation. This emergent toroidal
degrees of freedom provides a possibility for time reversal symmetry breaking with possible relevance
to the spontaneous Hall eﬀect observed in Pr2Ir2O7.

INTRODUCTION

In spin glasses, frustration is an essential ingredient of
the glassiness1, responsible for nonequilibrium phenom-
ena such as memory eﬀects. But even in disorder-free
systems, frustration, now of geometrical origin, imposes
considerable constraints on the kinetics, responsible for a
diverse range of unconventional dynamical behavior. The
interplay between frustration and spin dynamics has been
a long-standing source of questions in condensed matter
and statistical mechanics2. For example, the peculiar
dynamical response observed in triangular-based organic
systems3 has been intensively discussed recently in terms
of geometrical frustration.

Indeed, while geometrically frustrated magnets lack
disorder to generate a rugged energy landscape, they
have topology as a new ingredient for the generation
of slow dynamics: in the simplest terms, gauge-charged
topological defects cannot spontaneously disappear but
rather only pair-annihilate with an oppositely charged
partner. This provides connections to the physics of
reaction-diﬀusion systems, as well as to the coarsening
literature, and more generally to the study of kinetically
constrained models4–6.

While such topological constraints provide hard con-
ditions on the kinds of allowed dynamical processes,
they can be supplemented by soft yet important, non-

topological energetic considerations. Adding short-range
interactions between topological defects can give rise to
a rich phenomenology which has not yet been thoroughly
or systematically explored–for a case study of quantum
Hall physics and the links to diﬀerent types of supercon-
ductivity, see Ref. [7]. Our work aims to add considera-
tions of non-equilibrium dynamics to this intriguing set
of phenomena.

A well-studied and experimentally relevant case in
point is provided by spin ice, a canonical model and fam-
ily of materials with strong geometrical frustration8,9,
whose equilibrium properties are well explored. The
ground state of the spin ice model has macroscopic de-
generacy, and its spatial structure can be described by a
free emergent gauge-ﬁeld arising from a divergence-free
condition on the spin density imposed energetically. Ex-
citations out of this ground-state ensemble are analogues
of magnetic monopoles10, interacting together via an ef-
fective magnetic Coulomb potential.

From a dynamical point of view, the divergence-free
condition and interaction between monopoles imposes
strong microscopic kinematical constraints on the motion
of spins. Among other consequences, the magnetic relax-
ation time diverges at low temperature in Dy2Ti2O7 and
Ho2Ti2O7 spin-ice materials, as measured by a variety of
experimental probes, such as AC-magnetic susceptibil-
ity11–13, thermal transport14, neutron spin echo15, neu-

tron scattering16 and muon spectroscopy17. This spin
freezing is due to the rarefaction of defects18,19, medi-
ated by impurities and surface eﬀects20. Indeed, defects
play a fundamental role in facilitating spin dynamics21.
In fact, spin ice has been shown to be a fantastic frame-
work for unconventional nonequilibrium physics22, where
monopoles can form non-contractible pairs23 (see below).
In this context of anomalous spin-ice dynamics, the
metallic spin-ice material, Pr2Ir2O7, has recently at-
tracted considerable attention. In this compound, the Ir
5d conduction electrons interact with a magnetic ‘spin-
ice’ texture formed by the localized Pr3+ moments. The
enhanced spin-ice correlations induce anomalous scatter-
ing of conduction electrons24–27, and the resultant un-
usual transport properties have generated considerable
theoretical interest28–33. For instance, the Hall conduc-
tivity shows non-monotonic magnetic ﬁeld dependence,
implying that the Hall response is dominated by the
topological Hall eﬀect due to the scattering of itiner-
ant electrons from spin triplets with ﬁnite spin scalar
chirality25,29.

Even more striking is the so-called spontaneous Hall
eﬀect observed in this system, where a ﬁnite Hall re-
sponse is obtained with neither magnetic ﬁeld nor spon-
taneous magnetization. This implies the formation of
exotic states with broken time-reversal symmetry, but
without ferromagnetic order. To describe the experimen-
tal setting more precisely, the system is initially placed in
a magnetic ﬁeld of 7 Tesla in the [111] direction. After the
magnetic ﬁeld is removed, magnetization relaxes to zero,
while the ﬁnite Hall signal remains25. This phenomenon
has invited several interpretations, such as chiral spin
liquid formation25.

Possibly, this spontaneous Hall eﬀect may alternatively
be attributed to the nature of low-energy excitations.
The initial state obviously breaks time-reversal symmetry
under a magnetic ﬁeld, and naturally shows a ﬁnite Hall
response. Accordingly, if there exist non-magnetic exci-
tations which somehow encode the information of time-
reversal symmetry breaking, then the population of these
excitations reﬂect the broken time-reversal symmetry of
the initial state, and the Hall response might persist for a
period after the ﬁeld quench. Moreover, if the excitation
has a long lifetime, and do not relax within observable
time scales, even the “steady” state may retain a ﬁnite
Hall response.

In fact, the existence of long-living composite exci-
tations is known in dipolar spin ice. Non-contractible
pairs of monopoles are formed through the attractive
interaction between monopoles, and they exhibit long
lifetime23, as their pair annihilation can only proceed
across an energy barrier. The formation of composite
excitations may also occur in metallic spin ice, where the
magnetic moments interact through an RKKY-type in-
teraction, where the farther-neighbor interaction brings
about eﬀective interactions between topological defects.
It is interesting to examine how the interaction between
topological defects aﬀects the macroscopic dynamics of

structure has a central ring composed of minimally 6 tetrahe-
dra from which branches of same-sign charges emerge. The
loop of spins running along the central ring possesses a chiral-
ity whose value (clockwise or counterclockwise) is independent
of the sign of the charges. In the branches however, there is an
unidirectional ﬂux of magnetization which is imposed by the
sign of the charges. In this example, the magnetization ﬂux

tions.

II. MODEL AND SUMMARY OF MAIN

RESULTS

We study the J1−J2−J3 spin-ice model, which extends
the nearest-neighbor spin-ice model, by adding second-
neighbor (J2) and third-neighbor (J3) couplings. In this
work, we focus on the case J2 = J3(≡ J), setting J1 = 1.
This model can elegantly be rewritten in terms of gauge-
charged degrees of freedom35. The spin-ice degeneracy is
preserved and remains in the ground state of the model
for an extended region of couplings J ∈ [−1/2 : 1/4].
While the ground state belongs to the vacuum sector of
a Coulomb phase, its excitations are described as positive
and negative charges, which are called monopoles in the
context of dipolar spin ice.
Interestingly, an emergent
part of the interaction between charges for J 6= 0 is short-
ranged, and its sign is tunable by changing that of J.
Quasi-particles with the same topological charge attract
(repel) for J > 0(< 0).

Given these basic properties of the model, we ﬁrst sum-

marize the main results of our analysis. Firstly, let us
focus on the region of J > 0. This region is unusual in
the sense that “like” charges, i.e. quasi-particles hav-
ing the same gauge charge, attract, in contrast to, e.g.,
monopoles in dipolar spin ice. This property immediately
leads to the existence of collective excitations composed
of like charges, which we pictorially name “jellyﬁsh”. A
jellyﬁsh excitation is an extended structure consisting of
a central ring with an arbitrary numbers of branches at-
tached. Its excitation energy decreases with increasing
interaction J, vanishing at the critical point, J = 1/4.
In addition to the energetic stability mentioned above,
the jellyﬁsh excitation enjoys “kinematic stability”, i.e.
the clustering of same charges decreases the opportunities
of pair-annihilation, which occurs only between opposite
charges. The behavior of these charges is the subject of
our analysis of their stochastic dynamics.

The dynamical bottleneck caused by the jellyﬁsh ex-
citations leads to the possibility of interesting memory
eﬀects, including an emergent chiral degree of freedom
which carries zero magnetization. Indeed, the ring part
of jellyﬁsh carries a clockwise or counterclockwise circu-
lar ﬂow of magnetization, which gives it a well-deﬁned
toroidal moment. The stability of jellyﬁsh excitations
implies a slow relaxation of these toroidal moments. Ac-
cordingly, once the system is subject to a perturbation
which breaks time-reversal symmetry, e.g. a magnetic
ﬁeld, this symmetry breaking can in principle persist for
a long time, even after relaxation of the magnetization.
In the context of a magnetic ﬁeld quench, this suggests
that a signal of broken time-reversal symmetry can be
detected a long time after the removal of the magnetic
ﬁeld, e.g. through the Hall response. This provides a pos-
sible scenario for the mysterious spontaneous Hall eﬀect
observed in Pr2Ir2O7.

As well as in the dynamical properties, the jellyﬁsh ex-
citations leave their ﬁngerprints in thermodynamic quan-
tities, which we reveal by combining Monte Carlo sim-
ulations and the analytical Bethe approximation. Ap-
proaching the critical point, J = 1/4, the charge density
exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, re-
ﬂecting the softening of jellyﬁsh excitations. An immedi-
ate consequence of the softening is found in the entropy.
At J = 1/4, the zero-energy jellyﬁsh add contribution
to the ground state degeneracy of the spin ice mani-
fold, enhancing the residual value of the entropy. The
crossover behavior at the energy scale of jellyﬁsh excita-
tion gives a clear signature in the magnetic susceptibility,
χz. Near J = 1/4, χzT approaches its high temperature
value as the population of jellyﬁsh excitation grows, in-
stead of showing a monotonic Curie-law crossover as in
ideal spin ice36. Moreover, in addition to these ther-
modynamic quantities, the jellyﬁsh aﬀects the magnetic
structure factor considerably. Instead of pinch point sin-
gularities, which serve as an icon of the vacuum of the
Coulomb phase, a “half-moon” pattern appears in the
magnetic structure factor. The detection of this pattern
through quasi-elastic neutron scattering can serve as a

3

signature of jellyﬁsh structures.

While the region of J > 0 exhibits rich behavior
both dynamically and thermodynamically, fertile non-
equilibrium behavior is also observed for J < 0, where
opposite charges attract as is “normal”. For small neg-
ative J, the magnetization shows markedly slow relax-
ation, compared to the charge density. The magneti-
zation takes a constant value over a wide time range.
The formation of this magnetization plateau is associ-
ated with the exhaustion of charges, and the time scale
of its termination can be understood from the “vacuum
creation” of pairs of gauge charges.

Approaching J = −1/2,

the dynamics changes
drastically and becomes dominated by the inﬂuence of
double charges. As a result, charge relaxation becomes
extremely slow, while the magnetization decays rather
quickly. The system ﬁnally forms the co-called frag-
mented Coulomb spin liquid (FCSL)37–39. In the FCSL
charges are long-range ordered but the spin texture re-
mains disordered, extensively degenerate and described
by a Coulomb gauge theory. We shall here make the
following distinction. A conﬁguration in the Coulomb
phase of spin ice is entirely covered with two-in two-out
tetrahedra, while a FCSL conﬁguration is alternatively
covered by 3-in 1-out and 3-out 1-in tetrahedra:
the
four nearest-neighbours of a 3-in 1-out tetrahedron are
3-out 1-in tetrahedra, and vice-versa. The FCSL has
been predicted theoretically40,41 and observed experi-
mentally42–44 in nano-lithographic artiﬁcial kagome ice
whose geometry prevents the existence of a charge-free
Coulomb phase45. But in three dimensions, it has so
far only been partially stabilized at equilibrium in the
spin-ice model with dipolar interactions46, or requires
four-body interactions39 or the suppression of double
charges37,38. The nonequilibrium magnetic-ﬁeld quench
proposed here provides a promising tool to realize this
state and demonstrates the possibility of engineering a
macroscopic state via nonequilibrium techniques47.

The organization of this paper is as follows.

In sec-
tion III, we present the general form of the spin model
with ﬁrst, second and third nearest-neighbor interactions.
We rewrite this model with gauge charge degrees of free-
dom, which we name nearest-neighbor dumbbell model,
for a speciﬁc line of parameters. The corresponding phase
diagram is discussed in section IV. The nonequilibrium
properties of the model for a ﬁeld quench are exten-
sively investigated in section V. These results identify
a promising point, J = 1/4, on the phase diagram with
an enhanced emergent degeneracy. We present a thor-
ough analysis of the equilibrium properties around this
point in section VI. Consequences and future directions
of research are discussed in the conclusions.

III. THE MODEL

A.

J1 − J2 − J3 spin ice model

We shall consider a set of Ising moments at each site
i of a pyrochlore lattice, Si = ηidi where di deﬁnes the
local easy axis, and ηi = ±1 is the Ising variable. The
four sublattices of the pyrochlore lattice are deﬁned in
Fig. 2, with the following easy-axes:

By deﬁnition, the vectors di point outward (resp.

hedra [see Fig. 2.(b)]. We deﬁne the Hamiltonian of the

including successively the ﬁrst, second and third nearest-
neighbor coupling [see Fig. 2]. The nearest-neighbor in-
teraction leads to the spin-ice model with the 2-in 2-out

4

Coulomb phase dominating the physics below a temper-
ature of order J1. Hereafter, we set J1 = 1, as a unit
of energy and temperature. Meanwhile the second and
third terms are expected to considerably alter the qual-
itative nature of the ground state. However, as we shall
discuss in this paper, if J2 = J3 ≡ J, the spin-ice ground
state is preserved for a broad range of values of J.
One of our motivations to consider the J1 − J2 − J3
spin-ice model comes from its application as an eﬀective
model for spin degrees of freedom in pyrochlore conduc-
tors. In a group of pyrochlore oxides, such as Pr2Ir2O7,
the rare-earth moments behave as Ising moments and in-
teract with each other through the RKKY interaction
mediated by itinerant electrons originated from, e.g., d
orbitals of transition metal ions. Usually, the RKKY in-
teraction is long-ranged, however, its fast-decaying and
oscillating nature makes it possible to approximate it
with a short-range model.
Indeed, the phase diagram
of the Ising Kondo lattice model, where the eﬀect of itin-
erant electrons is fully taken into account, is quite well
reproduced by the J1 − J2 − J3 spin-ice model48.

B. Gauge-charge representation: J2 = J3 = J

As mentioned in the previous section, the J1 − J2 − J3
spin-ice model completely preserves the two-in two-out
degeneracy, as long as J2 = J3 is satisﬁed. To see this,
it is convenient to rewrite the Hamiltonian (2) in terms
of charge degrees of freedom, Qp, as was ﬁrst done by
Ishizuka et al.35. For a tetrahedron p composed of the
sites, p1, p2, p3 and p4, the charge is deﬁned as

Qp = ζp(ηp1 + ηp2 + ηp3 + ηp4),

(3)

where ζp = +1(−1),
if p corresponds to an upward
(downward) tetrahedron. Please note that the sign con-
vention used here is opposite to the one of magnetic
monopoles in the dumbbell model10. This is an arbi-
trary choice, possible because while the sign of magnetic
monopoles is a physical quantity imposed by the inher-
ent nature of magnetic dipolar interactions, the objects
considered here are topological charges whose convention
is for us to select. If the conﬁguration of tetrahedron p
is two-in two-out, then Qp = 0, while Qp = ±2 or ±4 for
single and double charges respectively [see Fig. 2]. Then,
if we rewrite Hamiltonian (2) as a function of charge de-
grees of freedom for J2 = J3, we obtain the nearest-
neighbour dumbbell model:

H = (cid:16) 1

2 − J(cid:17)X

p

p − J X

hp,qi

Qp Qq.

(4)

The details of the derivation are given in appendix A. The
two terms in the Hamiltonian (4) allow for simple inter-
pretations: the creation cost and the nearest-neighbor
interaction between charges. The two-in two-out degen-
eracy is trivially preserved (Qp = 0 everywhere), and, as
we shall see, even remains the ground state of Hamilto-
nian (4) for small values of |J|. In other words, in order

to lift the degeneracy of spin ice with a short-ranged per-
turbation, the relevant energy scale is |J2 − J3|, rather
than |J2| or |J3|.
The main diﬀerence with the standard dumbbell model
of magnetic monopoles in spin ice10 is that the interaction
between charges is now nearest-neighbour and can be ei-
ther attractive or repulsive between same-sign charges.
Also, our model is a one-parameter problem, J, which
means that the creation cost of charges is directly linked
to the strength of the interaction.

IV. PHASE DIAGRAM AT EQUILIBRIUM

Before going into the analysis of the dynamics, we
shall discuss the equilibrium phase diagram of this
model. For J2 = J3 = J, the phase diagram is divided
into three regions, as shown in Fig. 3. At J = 0,
the model
is precisely the nearest-neighbor spin ice
model, and its ground state is the well-known Coulomb
phase where all tetrahedra are in the two-in two-out
conﬁgurations [see e.g. the pedagogical review by Chris
Henley [49]]. Remarkably, the nearest-neighbor and the
present spin ice models are projectively equivalent: the
extensive degeneracy of the Coulomb phase is preserved
for ﬁnite J, and it remains ground state of the model for
a wide region of parameters, −1/2 < J < 1/4.

FIG. 3.
(color online). Ground-state phase diagram of
Hamiltonian (4) as a function of J. This corresponds to
the J1 − J2 − J3 spin-ice model for J2 = J3 = J, and
J1 = 1. The Coulomb phase is stabilized over a broad re-
gion (−1/2 < J < 1/4). For J < −1/2, it gives way to the
antiferromagnetic phase made of alternating all-in and all-out
tetrahedra (double charges). At J = 1/4, the jellyﬁsh point
discussed in section VI appears.

To understand the robustness of the Coulomb phase,
we rewrite the charge Hamiltonian given in equation (4)
as

+ J(cid:17)X

p

Q2
p −

J
2 X

hp,qi

(Qp + Qq)2.

(5)

Since both sums are non-negative, one can immediately
conclude that for −1/2 < J ≤ 0 the ground-state conﬁg-

5

urations satisfy Qp = 0 for all tetrahedra p, those of the
Coulomb phase.

Meanwhile, for J < −1/2, the ﬁrst term of Eq. (5)
becomes negative and is now minimized if |Qp| is max-
imized, i.e., Qp = ±4 for all p. At the same time, the
second term is minimized if Qp + Qq = 0. These two
conditions are simultaneously achieved,
if and only if
Qp = +4(−4) for all upward (resp. downward) tetra-
hedra. In terms of spins, this corresponds to all-in / all-
out conﬁgurations, which can be seen as a double charge
crystal (zinc-blende structure).

Right at J = −1/2, the creation cost of charges
in Hamiltonian (5) vanishes, making the double charge
crystal degenerate with the Coulomb phase. Moreover,
charge crystals made of alternating charges with Qp =
+2 and −2 on upward and downward tetrahedra respec-
tively also minimize the energy [see an example of spin
conﬁguration in Fig. 14]. This corresponds to the frag-
mented Coulomb spin liquid37,38 where long-range charge
order co-exists with extensive spin degeneracy.

As for the other side of the phase diagram, J > 0, the
limit of stability of the Coulomb phase is more subtle. If
one rewrites the Hamiltonian(4) as

H = (cid:16) 1

2 − 3J(cid:17)X

p

J
2 X

(Qp − Qq)2,

(6)

it guarantees that the ground state satisﬁes Qp = 0 for
all tetrahedra p, at least up to J = 1/6. The inter-
action term [see Eq. (4)] clearly favors same-sign nearest
neighbours, a condition that causes topological problems.
First of all, charge neutrality must be preserved over the
entire system: there must be as many positive as negative
charges, which means that not all bonds can satisfy the
condition (Qp − Qq) = 0 for nearest neighbours p and q.
Furthermore, when one tries to cover the pyrochlore lat-
tice with only, say, positive charges, one quickly encoun-
ters steric problems imposing the inclusion of vacuum or
negative charges, even at a short length scale.

According to equation (4), it is relatively easy to see
that there are only two kinds of spin clusters that mini-
mize the interaction energy [Fig. 17]:

• a double charge surrounded by four same-sign sin-

gle charges,

• a closed ring of same-sign single charges (this will
give rise to the jellyﬁsh structure discussed in detail
in section VI).

In both cases, one gets locally for the tetrahedra which
are part of these minimal clusters
p = X

QpQq.

Furthermore,
it is possible to attach same-sign single
charges to these minimal clusters, but no more dou-
ble charges.
Indeed if one takes the example of nega-
tive charges, then all spins on the outskirt of the clus-
ter point outwards, which strictly forbids to attach any

more double-negative charges. The addition of same-
sign single charges to these minimal clusters also pre-
serves the equality of equation (7). But as we have just
discussed, not all hp, qi bonds can satisfy the condition
(Qp − Qq) = 0. It means that these clusters cannot cover
the entire system. When summed over all tetrahedra,
one gets

For 0 < J < 1/4, the two-in two-out Coulomb phase
thus remains the ground state of the system. Since we
have shown the existence of conﬁgurations where the in-
equality of equation (9) is a strict equality, the Coulomb
phase is not stable anymore for J > 1/4. As for the
physics at J = 1/4, this deserves a dedicated discussion
in section VI.

V. NONEQUILIBRIUM DYNAMICS VIA FIELD

QUENCHES

In this section, we investigate the stochastic dynamics
of the model (2). To characterize the system, we focus
on the single charge density ρ1, and magnetization along
[111] axis. ρ1 is deﬁned as the sum of positive and nega-
tive single charges, divided by the number of tetrahedra,
so that the maximal value of ρ1 is normalized as 1. M is
also normalized to be 1, if the system is in a saturation
ﬁeld in [111] direction.

A. Nearest-neighbor spin-ice model

1. Temperature quench as a test

Firstly, we review the results for nearest-neighbor spin
ice: J2 = J3 = 0 in Fig. 4. Here, the temperature is
initially set at T = 10, then suddenly quenched to T = 0
at time t = 0. J1 = 1 as reference energy. In Fig. 4, we
plot the time dependence of the charge density. In this
setting, a ﬁnite charge density of ρi = 0.487 is thermally
excited at t = 0. After the temperature quench, charges
start to annihilate in pairs, and their density decreases
monotonically. Their density time dependence can be
described by a simple reaction-type equation23.

used for a quench. In an anisotropic system such as spin

In a ﬁeld quench, the system is initially set under the
magnetic ﬁeld H k [111], i.e. parallel to one of the easy
axes, with |H| = 100, which can be practically regarded
as a saturation ﬁeld. Then, the ﬁeld is removed suddenly
at time t = 0. At the initial stage, all the spins are
aligned in the [111] direction, and all the tetrahedra are
occupied with charges accordingly [see conﬁguration in
Fig. 5].

As shown in Fig. 6, the charge density decreases mono-
tonically after the ﬁeld quench, within a time scale of
O(1). The decrease of charge density is dominated by a
simple pair-annihilation process of charges. This process
accompanies the reduction of energy 4J1, and takes place
within the same order of time scale.

B. Field quench of the nearest-neighbour dumbbell

model (J = J2 = J3)

From now on, we shall consider the stochastic dynam-
ics of Hamiltonian (4) (J2 = J3 ≡ J) after a ﬁeld quench
of a saturated [111] ﬁeld: from very large |H| = 100 to
H = 0. As presented previously, it is important that

We start with the negative region, J < 0. The simple
comparison of Figs. 6 and 7 for J = 0 and J = −0.1 re-
spectively shows that the introduction of J qualitatively
alters the dynamical properties of the system. In Fig. 7,
the total charge density and magnetization of the sys-
tem are plotted together with the sublattice magnetiza-
tion decomposed into triangular and kagome planes [see

FIG. 6. (color online). Time evolution of the charge density
after a ﬁeld quench for the nearest-neighbor spin-ice model
(J = 0). The results at T = 0.1 and 0.01 are plotted with
(+) and (×) symbols. These two temperatures lead to almost
identical relaxation curves.

the initial conﬁguration at t = 0 is made of alternat-
ing positive and negative charges on the diamond lattice
formed by the centers of the tetrahedra [see conﬁguration
in Fig. 5]. Thus not only is the magnetization fully satu-
rated in the [111] direction; the charge degrees-of-freedom
are also perfectly aligned. The multiple energy barriers
associated with the most relevant dynamical processes
are summarized in appendix E.

FIG. 7. (color online). Field quench process at J = −0.10 and
T = 0.10. The charge density and magnetization are plotted
together with the sublattice magnetizations on kagome and
triangular layers. The time domain is divided into four re-
gions I, II, III and IV, as shown with dashed lines, according
to the qualitative nature of the dynamics. The sublattice
magnetizations, mtriangular and mkagome, are measured along
the [111] direction and are normalized by the total saturated
magnetization, giving rise to the value of 0.5 at t = 0.

The charge density decays monotonically and quickly
reaches practically zero on a time scale of O(1), in a
similar way to the case of J = 0. But in contrast to
non-interacting spin ice, the magnetization shows a non-
trivial time dependence with a wide plateau region. The
dynamical process can be qualitatively divided into four
time domains.

The time evolution starts with a nucleation process.
Since the pyrochlore lattice is decomposed into triangular
and kagome planes [Fig. 5], the initial event should either
be a spin ﬂip on a triangular plane or a kagome plane.
The former process is unlikely to occur, since the spin ﬂip
on triangular plane gives rise to double charges Q = ±4
whose energy cost is ∆5 = 12 − 12|J| > 0 [see appendix
E for details]. In contrast, the spin ﬂip on the kagome
plane lowers the energy, ∆1 = −4 + 20|J| < 0, which
is why this process occurs within the time scale of order
O(1).

Consequently in the time domain I of Fig. 7, spins

ﬂip almost randomly but only on kagome layers, creat-
ing pairs of vacuum tetrahedra – two-in two-out states.
This is conﬁrmed by Fig. 7 where only the magnetiza-
tion on kagome planes decreases, while that on triangu-
lar planes remains constant. However, these spin ﬂips are
not completely random. Indeed, one could have thought
that the created pairs of vacuum tetrahedra can disso-
ciate and diﬀuse within their kagome planes. However,
vacuum tetrahedra are conﬁned for J < 0 because their
diﬀusion brings same-sign charges next to each other, a
process whose energy cost is roughly proportional to the
distance between the diﬀused pair of vacuum tetrahedra
[see Fig. 8]. This process is thus prohibited at the begin-
ning of the relaxation (time domain I), as opposed to the
J = 0 case.

The spin ﬂips on kagome layers strongly suppress the
density of charges in the system [see Fig. 7]. Once the
charges become dilute enough, they can move freely,
without contact with other charges. This is the beginning
of the second time domain where, in particular, charges
can tunnel between adjacent kagome layers by ﬂipping
spins on triangular planes, resulting in the decrease of
the triangular sublattice magnetization.

However, in addition to the diﬀusion of charges, their
density continues to decrease, which eventually causes an
exhaustion problem. The system may not have had the
time to fully decorrelate before the exhaustion of charges,
leaving a long time plateau with ﬁnite magnetization and
no charges. This is the third time domain of Fig. 7.
Please note that this time plateau may split into two
parts for very small temperatures [see discussion in ap-
pendix F].

The system then remains frozen until the creation
and dissociation of charge pairs spontaneously occur, on
a time scale of the order of exp[(∆3 + ∆4)/T ], where
∆3 = 4 + 4|J| and ∆4 = 4|J|. The dissociated charges
propagate through the system and bring the magnetiza-
tion to its equilibrium vanishingly small value, deﬁning
the fourth and ﬁnal time domain. In Fig. 9, the time tp
at which the charge density ﬁnally decays to zero is plot-
ted as a function of 1/T . tp clearly follows the predicted
scaling law

tp ∝ exp[(∆3 + ∆4)/T ] = exp[(4 + 8|J|)/T ].

(11)

This conﬁrms that the lifetime of the magnetization time
plateau is determined by the pair creation and dissocia-
tion process of charges.

To summarize so far, the nonequilibrium relaxation dy-
namics for −0.2 < J < 0.0 displays the rich multiscale
behaviour, well understood from microscopic processes.
However, in light of the possibility of spontaneous Hall
eﬀect where we are looking for broken time-reversal sym-
metry without magnetization, this region is not partic-
ularly relevant since magnetization persists on a much
longer time scale than the charge density.

2. −0.25 < J < −0.20

The nature of dynamics qualitatively changes at J =
−0.20. Both magnetization and single charge density re-
main saturated over a time scale growing exponentially
with 1/T after the magnetic ﬁeld is switched oﬀ at t = 0
[Fig. 10]. Their decay is then simultaneous and visible in
both triangular and kagome layers. After this decay, a
wide plateau follows and the dynamics becomes similar
to the region for smaller |J|.
The persistence of the initial state can be attributed
to the dynamical bottleneck of the initial process. As
discussed in the section V B 1, the initial process is given
by the spin ﬂip on the kagome plane, which costs ∆1 =
−4 + 20|J|. Consequently, for J < −0.20, this process
requires a ﬁnite energy and takes an exponentially long
time at low temperatures.

However, once a pair of charges is created, the next
process becomes immediately available, since it costs no
more energy to create a pair of vacuum tetrahedra adja-
cent to the nucleation pair: ∆2 = −4 + 16|J| < 0. Con-
sequently the ﬁrst spin ﬂip serves as a nucleation seed
for an avalanche eﬀect of charge annihilation, until the
charges completely disappear from the system. After the
exhaustion of charges, the system reaches a plateau with
residual magnetization before ﬁnally relaxing thanks to
the creation and dissociation of charges, as observed for
−0.2 < J < 0.0.

3. −0.50 < J < −0.25

a. Dynamics

In this parameter range, both the nu-
cleation (∆1 = −4 + 20|J| > 0) and the proliferation
(∆2 = −4 + 16|J| > 0) processes cost a ﬁnite en-
ergy, preventing the avalanche eﬀect that takes place for
−0.25 < J. As an alternative mechanism of relaxation,
one needs to consider the dynamics along the [111] di-
rection, perpendicular to the kagome planes. The ﬁrst
two steps correspond to the creation of a vacuum tetra-
hedron and a double charge [see Fig. 11]. The energy of
this two-step process is ∆1 + ∆9 = ∆5 + ∆6 = 4 + 8|J|
and is independent of whether the nucleation occurs in
a kagome or a triangular plane [see the appendix E for
details]. When J > −3/7 ≈ −0.43, this two-step mecha-
nism along the [111] direction remains more expensive in
energy than the two-step proliferation in kagome planes
previously considered, ∆1 + ∆2 6 4 + 8|J|. But the
dynamics after these two initial steps is mediated by co-
existing energy barriers with similar magnitudes, and the
system is subject to a rather complex dynamical compe-
tition for −3/7 < J < −0.25 which varies from short to
long length scales.
On the other hand for −0.5 < J < −3/7, the mecha-
nism along the [111] direction becomes the most favorable
source of relaxation, both for their two-step nucleation
(∆1 + ∆9 = ∆5 + ∆6 < ∆1 + ∆2) and their propagation
(−∆7 = ∆8 = 8 − 16|J| < ∆2) [see Fig. 11].

9

FIG. 8. (color online). Illustration of the relaxation dynamics for −0.2 < J < 0.0. (a) The initial process that occurs in the
saturated conﬁguration is the spin ﬂip on the kagome plane, which leads to the pair annihilation of charges. While the diﬀusion
of vacuum tetrahedra is energetically unfavorable, successive pair annihilations are possible, making the charge density more
and more dilute. After enough dilution, the charges start to diﬀuse, as highlighted by red circles. (b) Before the magnetization
relaxes to zero, charges are exhausted. The relaxation of magnetization is then only possible via pair-creation and dissociation
of charges. Spin ﬂips are highlighted by yellow circles when necessary.

This scenario is conﬁrmed by simulations in Figs. 12
and 13. Most appreciably, the total magnetization drops
to zero, while i) the charge density keeps its saturated
value for several orders of magnitude in time and ii) the
sublattice magnetizations on triangular and kagome lay-
ers both take ﬁnite values. The extinction time of the
total magnetization is in quantitative agreement with an
Arrhenius law exp[−(∆5 + ∆6)/T ] = exp[−(4 + 8|J|)/T ]
at low temperature, reﬂecting the magnitude of the en-
ergy barrier of the nucleation process.

As for the plateau of Fig. 12 after the extinction of
the total magnetization,
it comes from the fact that,
as opposed to the proliferation of vacuum tetrahedra
observed for −0.25 6 J, the mechanism along the [111]
direction is mediated by the propagation of pairs of local
excitations: vacuum tetrahedra and double charges39.
Both excitations can fragment into two single charges:
one which is ﬁxed and respects the initial charge order,
remnant of the ﬁeld quench, and the second one which
can move along the [111] direction. As a result, the
density of single charges varies only very weakly, in order
to accommodate a vanishingly small density of local
excitations. For the parameter region −0.5 < J < −3/7,

the propagation along the [111] direction costs zero
or little energy −∆7 = ∆8 = 8 − 16|J| ∈ [0; 1.14]
when compared to the nucleation process ∆1 + ∆9 =
∆5 + ∆6 = 4 + 8|J| ∈ [7.43; 8]. As a consequence the
system does not relax into the vacuum ground state
made of two-in two-out tetrahedra [see Fig. 3], but
conserves the initial long-range charge order illustrated
in Fig. 14.

b. Fragmented Coulomb spin liquid The FCSL
phase is partially ordered due to a broken Z2 symmetry
of the charge degrees-of-freedom: every positive charge
has four negative nearest-neighbour charges, and vice-
versa [see Fig. 14]. This leaves a Z2 degeneracy of the
charge order, as for the all-in / all-out phase. But as
opposed to the all-in / all-out order, the magnetic “crys-
tal” of the FCSL phase is made of single charges, which
retains an extensive spin degeneracy. It also supports an
emergent Coulomb gauge ﬁeld due to a local divergence-
free constraint on the magnetization ﬂux38. When av-
eraged over its Gibbs ensemble, the FCSL phase does
not bear any ﬁnite total magnetization. However, the
broken Z2 symmetry of the charge order gives rise to ﬁ-

Please note that this broken symmetry is not sponta-
neous, but selected by the initial [111] magnetic ﬁeld.
As illustrated on Fig. 5, a spin on a triangular layer al-
ways has a negative charge above, and a positive one
below, resulting in an averaged triangular magnetization

negative one below, resulting in an averaged kagome mag-

netization mkagome = +1/4. These values correspond to
the plateaux observed in Fig. 12 for t > 104, and imply
that a substantial part of the FCSL Gibbs ensemble is
visited during the relaxation.

A ferromagnetic analogue of the FCSL phase has been
predicted in the magnetization plateau of HgCr2O4 and
CdCr2O4 materials50,51, where the (partial) order param-
eter couples to the magnetic ﬁeld. However, the present
FCSL phase is an antiferromagnet.

With the peculiar exceptions of models where double
charges were explicitly forbidden37,38, and 2D artiﬁcial
kagome ice systems40–44, the FCSL has been noticeably
elusive at equilibrium in 3D spin-ice models46, despite its
deceptive simplicity.

In the present nearest-neighbour dumbbell model for
example, it is part of the ground-state ensemble only
for J = −0.5, degenerate with the all-in/all-out order
and the two-in two-out spin-ice ground state [see Fig. 3].
It disappears however at ﬁnite temperature in favor
of the two-in two-out spin-ice regime because of their
entropy diﬀerence. The present setup thus oﬀers a rare
mechanism able to stabilize a metastable form of the
FCSL phase, expanding the versatility of nonequilibrium
physics in spin ice22.

c. Hall response The ﬁnal question regarding the
FCSL phase is its relevance to the Hall eﬀect. For this
parameter range, the relaxation of the charge density is
much slower than that of the magnetization [see Fig. 12].
In this sense, the situation may be similar to the ex-
perimental condition of the spontaneous Hall eﬀect ob-
served in Pr2Ir2O7 [26]. However, based on symmetry
arguments, the Hall conductivity is exactly zero in the
FCSL phase. Quite generally, provided the spin con-
ﬁgurations on upward and downward tetrahedra can be
transformed into each other through time-reversal, then
the Hall conductivity becomes zero, if spatial homogene-
ity is preserved on average [see appendix G]. This means
that a ﬁnite Hall response is not expected to occur for
negative J, where positive charges tend to sit next to
negative ones.

4.

0.00 < J < 0.25

Now, let us consider the other side of the phase dia-
gram, with J > 0. Charges of opposite sign repel, mak-
ing the initial [111] polarized state particularly unstable.
The dynamical feature after the ﬁeld quench is plotted in
Fig. 15, where the decrease in charge density ρ1 and total
magnetization M start very quickly. After a time scale
of O(1), both ρ1 and M develop a shoulder-like feature
after which the relaxation process slows down. Never-
theless, the magnetization decays smoothly to zero, and
subsequently, charges also disappear completely. Inter-
estingly, the whole time dependence of ρ1 and M can be
scaled with a single parameter J/T [see Fig. 15].

The early stage of the relaxation is very similar to the

pairs of positive/negative single charges can separate
at no energy cost since they repel. There is thus
no energy barrier for the diﬀusion of charges. The
resulting separation of charges makes their eventual
annihilation statistically more scarce and energetically
unfavorable since a pair of positive/negative charges
needs to get close to each other before being able to
annihilate. Accordingly, in the absence of high-energy
charge creation processes, the dynamics in this time
domain is dominated by a single energy scale, the
nearest-neighbour repulsion, proportional to J [see

quasi-plateau of charge density observed in Fig.
15.
Furthermore, even if charge diﬀusion ﬁrst slows down
the magnetization decay (the diﬀusion process is mostly
uncorrelated with the direction of the spin), it ultimately
allows for the complete relaxation of the system down
to zero magnetization.

For larger values of J, the magnetization shows ap-
proximately the same curve as in Fig. 15, but the pre-
vious J/T scaling breaks down for the charge density ρ
on long time scales [see Fig. 16]. It implies the appear-

ance of a new energy barrier which is not simply pro-
portional to J, i.e. a dynamical mechanism involving
charge creation/annihilation [see Eq. (4)]. This is un-
derstood by the fact that the creation cost of charges in
equation (4) diminishes as J increases. The creation of
a pair of charges can be further facilitated if it occurs
in the appropriate “cage” of same-sign charges. This is
why, for large enough J, the energy barrier of the nearest-
neighbour repulsion which was responsible for the J/T
scaling can be replaced by a charge-creation barrier. Fi-
nally, when J reaches the value of 1/4, the relaxation
of ρ1 becomes non-monotonic, underlining a qualitative
change of physics at J = 1/4 as discussed in section IV.

Hence, the energy cost for creating a charge is exactly
balanced with the energy gain from placing a pair of
same-sign charges next to each other. As brieﬂy intro-
duced in section IV, there are two minimal clusters of
spins respecting this balance. The ﬁrst one is a closed
ring of charges, where the number of charges is equal to
the number of bonds between them. The ring is made
of at least six tetrahedra. The second type of cluster is
reminiscent of a methane molecule, composed of a double
charge next to four single charges [see Fig. 17].

FIG. 17.
(color online). Schematic ﬁgures of the minimal
clusters: (a) a ring made of six tetrahedra for the jellyﬁsh
and (b) methane-like structure.

These two clusters are actually the seeds of extended
zero-energy textures. Attaching same-sign charges to
these seeds does not cost energy since it adds the same
number of charges and bonds. As illustrated in Fig. 1, it
is possible to attach branches to the central ring, which
we pictorially refer to as a jellyﬁsh structure. Conse-
quently, for J = 1/4, the two-in two-out spin-ice ground
state receives additional macroscopic degeneracy coming
from these composite forms. Away from the J = 1/4
point, these structures become excitations with energy:

Ejellyﬁsh = 4(Nbranch + 6)(cid:16) 1
Emethane = 4(Nbranch + 8)(cid:16) 1

2 − 2J(cid:17),
2 − 2J(cid:17),

(13)

(14)

where Nbranch is the number of charges in the branch.

If the charge description is elegant, one should not for-
get the underlying spin texture. As illustrated in Fig. 1,
each tetrahedron in a branch hosts a gauge charge, and
therefore has three majority spins and one minority spin.
Each tetrahedron is connected to its “parent” tetrahe-
dron strictly and uniquely via the minority spin, which
means that the branches can bifurcate or trifurcate, but
never form closed loops nor connect to other jellyﬁsh or
methane-like structures. Such connection is energetically
unfavorable for opposite-sign structures and topologically
forbidden for same-sign structures. Moreover, the se-
quence of spins along the backbone of any branch form
an oriented path. Depending on the sign of the gauge
charges, this oriented path ﬂows either towards or away
from the central seed (the ring or the double charge).

For the jellyﬁsh structure, there is an additional
degree-of-freedom present in the central ring, which car-
ries a circular magnetization ﬂow with two choices of chi-
rality: clockwise or counterclockwise. Due to this circular
magnetization ﬂow, the ring acquires a toroidal moment,
Tring, deﬁned by

Tring = X

i

ri × Si,

(15)

where, ri is the relative coordinate of site i, measured
from the center of the ring. Consequently, T ﬂips its

13

sign when the magnetization ﬂow is reversed.
It is an
important property which allows the local encoding of
time-reversal symmetry in a zero-energy texture, inde-
pendently of the sign of the gauge charges it belongs to,
i.e. independently of global time-reversal symmetry.

This emergent toroidal moment takes an enhanced
ﬂavor in the context of ﬁeld-quench dynamics discussed
in the previous section.
If a coupling between spin
and spatial degrees of freedom is taken into account
– e.g. by adding spin-orbit coupling in our model –
the ﬁeld induced time-reversal symmetry breaking of
the initial state can be potentially encoded in the ring
of the jellyﬁsh structures.
In other words, toroidal
moments may persist long after the magnetic ﬁeld is
quenched.
It is tempting to associate this possibility
with the spontaneous Hall eﬀect observed in Pr2Ir2O7
[26]. Namely the residual Hall response may be ascribed
to the combined eﬀects of slow relaxation and toroidal
ordering due to the jellyﬁsh clusters. Indeed, the decay
of a jellyﬁsh cluster incurs an activation energy barrier
of the order J and becomes exponentially slow in J/T
at low temperatures (see Appendix H for a discussion of
the possible decay processes and their relative barriers).

B. Crossover into the jellyﬁsh regime

We have studied the emergence of the jellyﬁsh struc-
tures by the means of Monte Carlo simulations and
Bethe-lattice approximation at equilibrium. Technical
details of the methods are discussed in appendices C
and D.

Let us ﬁrst deﬁne the variable

MQ.Q =

1
N X

hp,qi

Qp.Qq

4

.

(16)

where N is the total number of pyrochlore sites. MQ.Q
is a spatially averaged measurement of the nearest-
neighbour ordering of charges. In the all-in/all-out anti-
ferromagnetic order and in the FCSL phase, it takes the
values MQ.Q = −4 and −1 respectively. Please note that
MQ.Q is not a proper order parameter of these phases,
since MQ.Q does not diﬀerentiate between the conﬁgura-
tions with broken Z2 symmetry. But it is a convenient
probe of the evolution of nearest-neighbour correlation
and it directly couples to the interaction term of equa-
tion (12).

MQ.Q takes a ﬁnite positive value as expected for
J = 1/4 > 0, and reaches a plateau for T < 0.2 [see
Fig. 18.(d)]. This plateau is a signature of the jellyﬁsh
regime and it is also revealed by a corresponding plateau
in the charge density ρ in Fig. 18.(e), as conﬁrmed by
the quantitative agreement between Monte Carlo simula-
tions and Bethe-lattice calculations [see the dashed lines
in Fig. 18 for the Bethe-lattice results].

Let us check if these values are consistent with our under-
standing of section VI A. Let N and Nt be the number of
spins and tetrahedra respectively, with N = 2Nt. Then
there are Ntρ2 double charges, each of them surrounded
by four single charges [see section VI A]. Thus 4Ntρ2 sin-
gle charges are directly linked to a double charge, while
Nt(ρ1 − 4ρ2) are linked to a single charge in the branches
of jellyﬁsh or methane structures. One can thus estimate

which quantitatively matches the measured value of
equation (20). Please note that the above formula is also
valid for Husimi calculations, but with somewhat lower
values of MQ.Q = 0.165, ρ1 = 0.316 and ρ2 = 0.00363.

For J = 1/4, the ground-state ensemble does not
break any symmetry of the Hamiltonian, and includes
all of the two-in two-out conﬁgurations (traditional spin-
ice ground states) and all of the conﬁgurations with
the structures discussed in section VI A (jellyﬁsh and
methane-like). The entropy of the J = 1/4 ground state
is thus extensively large and higher than the one of spin
ice [Fig. 18.(b)]. The absence of symmetry breaking and
the very high entropy justify why the passage from the
high-temperature paramagnet to the jellyﬁsh regime is
a crossover and not a phase transition, as conﬁrmed by
the speciﬁc heat Ch and the magnetic susceptibility χz
of Fig. 18.(a,c).

z i ≡ hM 2

The variance of the magnetization h∆M 2

zi −
hMzi2 ≡ N χz T directly measures the build-up of corre-
lations in classical spin liquids, visible in the Curie-law
crossover of Fig. 18.(a)36. The fact that it reaches the
value of 1/3 (within error bars) as T → 0+, i.e. as for a
standard paramagnet, is remarkable and consistent with
the fact that the long-range dipolar correlations of the
two-in two-out phase52 are cut oﬀ by the jellyﬁsh and
methane-like structures.

In the absence of a critical point, the Bethe lattice cal-
culations provide a very good approximation of the real
system. This is especially visible in Fig. 18.(e), where the
temperature dependence of the charge density is essen-
tially indistinguishable from simulations. There is how-
ever a small but clear diﬀerence for the second-order cu-
mulant of the energy and magnetisation [see 18.(a,c)].
This is probably a consequence of the de facto absence
of closed loops of spins in the Bethe lattice, preventing
the emergence of jellyﬁsh structures.

FIG. 19. (color online). Temperature dependence of the den-
sity of single charges probed by Monte Carlo simulations for
J = 0.24, just below the jellyﬁsh phase. Each curve corre-
sponds to a diﬀerent simulation time, from 105 to 108 Monte
Carlo steps. This shows that even if the thermalization pro-
cess is very slow, the density of charges eventually vanishes
for J < 1/4. We use the deﬁnition of a Monte Carlo step,
made of Nt single-spin ﬂip attempts and 10 worm updates,
with Nt, the number of tetrahedra. Monte Carlo dynamics
include 1 parallel tempering every 100 Monte Carlo steps.

C. On the way to the jellyﬁsh: J . 1/4

The increase of single-charge density in Fig. 16 can
now be understood by the emergence of charge structures
precisely at J = 1/4. However, even though these struc-
tures are excitations for J < 1/4, they visibly play a role
in the relaxation just below 1/4 [see the J = 0.24 curve
in Fig. 16]. We have conﬁrmed this inﬂuence by Monte
Carlo simulations in Fig. 19, where the low-temperature
single-charge density ρ1 tends to zero with increasing
Monte Carlo time. Despite the use of parallel temper-
ing and worm algorithm [see appendix C], and a very
slow decrease of the temperature during the preliminary
Monte Carlo equilibration – made of up to 10 million
Monte-Carlo steps (MCs) – simulations require 100 mil-
lion MCs to reach the equilibrium vanishing value of ρ1.
Such slow dynamics in absence of disorder is well-known
in spin ice11,12,18,22,23,53–55, even without any thermal or
ﬁeld quench, but relatively rare for a phase with a ﬁ-
nite density of charges, which are usually the source of
dynamics [see e.g. the third time domain of Fig. 7].

Both single and double charges completely vanish as
T → 0 for 0 6 J < 1/4 [see Fig. 21], but with a pro-
nounced shoulder at ﬁnite temperature as one gets closer
to the 1/4 value. This shoulder marks the change from
the low-temperature two-in two-out regime, and the en-
tropically induced apparition of jellyﬁsh structures at in-
termediate temperatures. The crossover temperature is
characterized by the energy scale Ejellyﬁsh of Eq. (13).

For J < 1/4, χzT ultimately goes to ≈ 2/3, characteristic of
the two-in two-out Coulomb phase36. For J = 1/4, χzT shows
a clear downturn towards ≈ 1/3, signature of a classical spin
liquid diﬀerent from the Coulomb phase. (b) Order parameter
MQ.Q deﬁned in eq. 16, showing partial ordering for J = 1/4,
but not J < 1/4. As J increases, MQ.Q remains strictly pos-
itive to lower and lower temperature, showing the growing
inﬂuence of the jellyﬁsh phase. The agreement between an-
alytics and simulations is quantitative for J = {0, 0.22} and
semi-quantitative for J = 0.24, where the inﬂuence of jellyﬁsh
structures at ﬁnite temperature comes into play – especially
the ring of single charges.

This behaviour is most visible in the Curie-law crossover
of Fig. 20.(a). The quantity χz T always reaches the 2/3
value characteristic of spin ice36, but delayed by an or-
der of magnitude in temperature between J = 0 (yel-
low curve) and J = 0.24 (red curve). The same abrupt
crossover is visible in MQ.Q [see Fig. 20.(b)]. The pres-
ence of a crossover instead of a phase transition is con-
ﬁrmed by Bethe-lattice calculations, but could not be
completely ruled out by simulations for 0.24 < J < 0.25.
On a side note, the small negative value of MQ.Q for
J = 0 (nearest-neighbor spin-ice model) is a consequence
of the entropic Coulomb interactions between topological
defects in spin ice39,49,56.

D. Neutron-scattering signature

Our ﬁnal question concerns the experimental detection
of the jellyﬁsh regime. A possible ﬁngerprint would be
the Curie-law crossover of Fig. 18.(a). But since χz T
reaches a value of 1/3 identical to a standard paramag-
net, the real signature lies in the bump of the crossover
which unfortunately could be modiﬁed by perturbations
pertinent at intermediate or high temperatures such as
ﬁnite single-ion anisotropy.

On the other hand, quasi-elastic neutron scattering
should be able to detect the ﬁngerprints of the jellyﬁsh
structures. Neutron scattering measures the structure
factor of the material

where S⊥
i are the spin components orthogonal to the vec-
tor q and ri is the position of site i. The structure factor

16

obtained from neutron scattering for J = 1/4 is shown
in Fig. 22 (top panels). At low temperature, distinctive
half-moon features of scattering appear. These features
are relatively broad and surround – i.e. do not sit on –
the Brillouin zone centers. They persist at higher temper-
atures, albeit more diﬀuse, and are conﬁrmed by a phe-
nomenological analysis taking into account only the con-
tributions from the ring part of the jellyﬁsh [see Fig. 23].
These half-moon scattering motifs are very exotic for a
spin-ice model and can thus serve as a solid signature of
the jellyﬁsh regime in experiments.

When stepping away from the J = 1/4 model, one
recovers the characteristic pinch points of the spin-ice
Coulomb phase at very low temperature [see Fig. 22 (bot-
tom panels) for J = 0.22], as predicted from the discus-
sion of section VI C. At higher temperatures (T = 1),
the higher entropy of the jellyﬁsh regime wins over the
Coulomb phase, and one recovers the half-moon features
of J = 1/4. In particular this broad scattering precisely
replaces the pinch points, consistent with the correlated
density of charges in the jellyﬁsh regime57,58.

VII. CONCLUSION

Motivated by the coupling between itinerant electrons
and localized spins in spin-ice materials, we have inves-
tigated the physics of Ising spins on the pyrochlore lat-
tice with ﬁrst, second- and third-neighbour interactions
[see equation (2)]. We have focused on the line where
J2 = J3 = J, where our model can be rewritten in terms
of charge degrees-of-freedom, giving rise to the nearest-
neighbour dumbbell model [see equation (4)].

The two-in two-out Coulomb phase remains the
ground state of the model over a broad range of pa-
rameters (−0.5 < J < 0.25). By varying J within this
window, the relaxation processes after a ﬁeld quench in
the [111] direction display a rich diversity of nonequilib-
rium phenomena, with e.g. glassy behavior in absence of
disorder due to multi-scale energy barriers, which can be
quantitatively understood by a microscopic approach.

For small values of J (−0.25 < J < 0), the magneti-
zation decay shows markedly slow relaxation when com-
pared to the charge density.
It gives rise to (multiple)
magnetization plateaux over several orders of magnitude
in time due to the exhaustion of charges. When ap-
proaching from J = −0.25 to the phase-diagram bound-
ary J = −1/2, the dynamics changes drastically and is
dominated by the diﬀusion of double charges and vacuum
tetrahedra. As a result, the initial charge order imposed
by the ﬁeld quench at t = 0 persists while the mag-
netization quickly vanishes. The resulting metastable
phase is known as the fragmented Coulomb spin liquid
(FCSL)37–39, where long-range (charge) order co-exists
with a (Coulomb) spin liquid. The FCSL is a very elu-
sive phase, which makes the present ﬁeld-quench protocol
a rare opportunity to realize it in a realistic model.

simulations for J = 0.25 (top) and 0.22 (bottom) at T = {0.1, 0.3, 1}. Top: For J = 1/4, the pattern of the structure factor
is relatively similar from T = 1 to 0.1, showing sharper intensities around the half-moon features upon cooling (in yellow at
T = 0.1). Bottom: For J = 0.22 on the other hand, one moves continuously from the low-temperature spin-ice regime with
sharp pinch points57 to the jellyﬁsh regime at T = 1 [see section VI C]. The half-moon features characteristic of the jellyﬁsh
regime sit at the same wavevectors as the pinch points in spin ice. The color scale is the same for all panels for each given value
of J.

As for positive J, the dynamics develop an interesting
J/T scaling law due to the repulsion between opposite-
sign charges, which hinders their ability to annihilate
pairwise. As approaching J = 1/4, this scaling breaks
down as the system acquires a ﬁnite gauge charge density
in thermodynamic equilibrium, due to the high popula-
tion of composite excitations which we have pictorially
termed methane and jellyﬁsh, as discussed in Sec. VI A.
These structures, once created, decay slowly because of
the high energy barriers accompanied with their collapse
[see Sec. H].

While the jellyﬁsh structure is non-magnetic, the cen-
tral ring carries an emergent chiral degree of freedom,
characterized by a toroidal moment. Accordingly, the
jellyﬁsh structure is able to encode the information of
time-reversal symmetry breaking with this toroidal de-
gree of freedom. This feature, combined with the long

lifetime, implies a potential relevance to the spontaneous
Hall eﬀect observed in Pr2Ir2O7.
Aiming at the detection of

jellyﬁsh, we combined
numerical/phenomenological analyses to show that the
“half-moon” structure in the S(q) is a clear signature of
the jellyﬁsh structure. Experimentally, the detection of
various types of composite excitations has been carried
out for frustrated magnets, such as Zn/Mg/HgCr2O4 and
59–64. Our analysis indicates that the quasi-
Tb2Ti2O7
elastic neutron scattering is a promising experimental
probe to detect the jellyﬁsh, which may clarify the origin
of spontaneous Hall eﬀect in Pr2Ir2O7.

The natural next step of this analysis would be to in-
vestigate what happens for J > 1/4. In this region the
two-in two-out Coulomb phase is not part of the ground
state anymore, and the ordering mechanism is completely
dominated by the attraction between same-sign charges,

states via nonequilibrium techniques47. We hope our
work will further motivate the exploration of nonequi-
librium phenomena in geometrically frustrated mag-
nets, ranging from topological ergodicity breaking74 to
glassiness without disorder18,23, and with connections to
kagome systems75,76 including their realization in artiﬁ-
cial spin ice40–44 and the 16-vertex model54,55.

Appendix A: Charge representation of the

J1 − J2 − J3 spin ice model

Here, we derive the charge representation of the J1 −
J2 − J3 spin ice model at J2 = J3 = J. For this purpose,
we rewrite the Hamiltonian (2), up to constant, in the
following form:

H =

1
2 X
+J X

p

(ηp1 + ηp2 + ηp3 + ηp4)2

(ηp1 + ηp2 + ηp3 + ηp4 − η[p,q])

hp,qi

× (ηq1 + ηq2 + ηq3 + ηq4 − η[p,q]).

(A1)

In the ﬁrst term, the summation is taken over the tetrahe-
dra, p, while in the second term, the summation is over
neighboring pairs of tetrahedra, hp, qi. The ﬁrst term
comes from the nearest-neighbor interactions which con-
nect spins on the same tetrahedron. Meanwhile, the sec-
ond term is due to the second- and third-neighbor cou-
plings which connect spins on neighboring tetrahedra.
For this rewriting, we named the sites on the neighbor-
ing tetrahedra, p and q, as p1− p4 and q1− q4, as shown
in Fig. 24 (a). These tetrahedra share one site, which
we call η[p,q].
In the convention shown in Fig. 24 (a),
η[p,q] = ηp4 = ηq4.

By introducing a charge variable, ˜Qp ≡ ηp1 + ηp2 +

ηp3 + ηp4, the ﬁrst term can be transformed into

seen around the Brillouin zone centers, consistent with the
results of Monte Carlo simulation [Fig. 22].

inducing strong steric and kinetic constraints. Our simu-
lations indicate an increase in single and double charges
below a ﬁrst order transition, but we found that this
phase is very diﬃcult to thermalize.

Beyond the original motivation of RKKY interactions
in metallic systems, our model directly applies to insulat-
ing pyrochlores with farther-neighbour exchange. Such
interactions might be present in spin-ice materials65–67
and be of importance for quantum spin ices where vir-
tual crystal ﬁeld excitations can induce coupling beyond
nearest-neighbors68,69. The J2 = J3 condition is an ar-
guably strong constraint, but very useful by its simplicity
in order to serve as a basis for perturbative approaches.
Our paper also provides a working example of what
happens when it is possible to tune the interactions be-
tween topological defects away from their natural set-
ting. Indeed, spin ice has often been described as a mag-
netic analogue of an electrolyte56,70–73, a picture which
relies on the Coulomb attraction between opposite-sign
charges. The possibility to reverse the sign of this interac-
tion, even just at the nearest-neighbour level, drastically
changes the physics of the problem. Clusters of quasi-
particles can be stabilized because i) charges of same
signs cannot annihilate by pair and ii) charges of opposite
signs – which could annihilate – are repelled from each
other. Such questions are certainly not limited to spin
ice, but extend naturally to phases prone to emergent
quasi-particles such as quantum spin liquids, topological

Appendix B: Waiting time Monte Carlo method

Since the J1 − J2 − J3 spin ice model is composed of
classical degrees of freedom, the rule of time evolution
is not determined a priori. Here, we assume a stochas-
tic dynamics deﬁned as follows. Suppose that the spin
conﬁguration Ωα ≡ {Si} is realized at time t, with prob-
ability P (Ωα). P (Ωα) evolves with time by the following

stochastic equation:

d
dt

P (Ωα) =

1

τ0 X

α6=β

19

[P (Ωβ)W (Ωβ → Ωα)

− P (Ωα)W (Ωα → Ωβ)],

(B1)

where τ0 gives the unit of time, and W (Ωα → Ωβ) is the
transition rate from the state Ωα to Ωβ. Here, we assume
only a single spin ﬂip process, i.e., W (Ωα → Ωβ) is ﬁnite,
if and only if the state Ωβ can be obtained from Ωα by
ﬂipping a single spin. For the two conﬁgurations, Ωα and
Ωβ, we assume a transition rate of thermal bath type,

W (Ωα → Ωβ) =

exp(−βE(Ωβ))

.(B2)

exp(−βE(Ωα)) + exp(−βE(Ωβ ))

In order to solve the stochastic equation (B1), we re-
sort to the waiting time Monte Carlo method. The pro-
cedure of this numerics is divided into several steps. Sup-
pose, the system is at n-th step with time, tn, then the
calculation goes as follows: (i) Make a table of transi-
tion probabilities: pi for all possible Ising variable, ηi,
to ﬂip, according to the transition rate (B2).
(ii) de-
termine which ηi to ﬂip, according to the probability
pi/ptot (ptot = Pi pi), by generating a random number
r1 ∈ [0, 1]. (iii) obtain the time τ taken to make the ﬂip
by τ = − 1
log(r2) (r2 ∈ [0, 1]). (iv) update the time
tn+1 = tn + τ . (v) repeat (i)-(iv) at suﬃcient times and
make a sample average.

ptot

In the actual calculations, we typical choose the system
size: Nsite = 16 × 16 × 16 × 4, number of steps: Nstep =
1000Nsite, and the number of samples: Nsample = 100.

Appendix C: Monte Carlo simulations

For the characterization of the J = 1/4 model dis-
cussed in section VI, we made extensive use of classical
Monte Carlo simulations with single spin ﬂip dynamics,
parallel tempering and worm algorithm. The worm al-
gorithm especially is a powerful method to decorrelate
systems where single spin ﬂip dynamics become ineﬃ-
cient because of a local ice rule77.
In spin ice, this is
the case for the two-in two-out Coulomb phase. In the
present study however, we are especially interested in the
presence of topological defects which break this ice rule.
To circumvent the problem, we used an extension of the
worm algorithm developed in Ref. [38].

The worm is made of a unidirectional closed chain of
spins where all spins point in the same direction along
the chain. It is constructed spin by spin until it closes on
itself. Let us arbitrarily choose that during its construc-
tion, the worm enters a tetrahedron via a spin pointing
inward. Then, the worm may enter

• a two-in two-out tetrahedron: there are two equiv-
alent outward spins to exit the tetrahedron, chosen
with probability 1/2.

• a three-in one-out tetrahedron: there is one out-
ward spin to exit the tetrahedron, chosen with
probability 1.

• a one-in three-out tetrahedron:

there are three
equivalent outward spins to exit the tetrahedron,
chosen with probability 1/3.

• an all-in tetrahedron: there are no possibilities to
exit the tetrahedron. The worm is stopped and
erased.

The procedure is repeated until the worm closes. Be-
cause such a worm is made of as many inward spins as
outward spins for every tetrahedron it encounters, ﬂip-
ping all spins in the worm does not modify the position
nor the sign of the charges. Since the Hamiltonian of
our model can be written in terms of charge degrees-of-
freedom only [se equation (4)], ﬂipping a worm does not
modify the energy of the system, and detailed balance is
thus naturally respected.

Appendix D: Bethe approximation

Thermodynamic properties of the J1 − J2 − J3 model
can be semi-analytically evaluated by Bethe approxima-
tion. This method is equivalent to approximating the py-
rochlore lattice with its loopless variant, the tetrahedron
Husimi cactus (THC) as shown in Fig. 24 (b). Themo-
dynamic quantities, such as speciﬁc heat and magnetic
susceptibility, as well as charge density can be evaluated
exactly on this network, and its temperature dependence
rather precisely matches the result of Monte Carlo simu-
lation [see section VI].

For the sake of explanation, we here summarize our
convention. Firstly, we introduce four sublattices and as-
sign anisotropy axis, dα(α = 1 − 4), as deﬁned in section
III A, to discuss magnetic susceptibility in this scheme.
The sublattice index of site i is denoted as αi. To discuss
the tetrahedron-based quantities, we choose one tetrahe-
dron, T0, and consider the array of tetrahedra, starting
from T0. In particular, we deﬁne TN as the N -th tetra-
hedron from T0 [Fig. 24(b)]. Each tetrahedron Tj has 24
possible states ζj(= 1 − 16) corresponding to the values
of spins, η, on its four sites. We assume that the state ζ
has charge Q[ζ], and the spin at sublattice α is denoted
as ηα[ζ].

1. Partition function on half cactus

The basic building blocks of this approximation are
the partial partition functions evaluated on half cac-
tus, which are obtained by terminating the tetrahedron
Husimi cactus at the “root site”, O, as shown in Fig. 25
(a). In particular, we call the tetrahedron involving the
site O, “root tetrahedron”. We consider the Hamiltonian
(2) on this network, and sum up the Boltzmann factors

20

for all the conﬁgurations of {ηi}, to obtain the partition
function, z. In particular, we focus on the partial sum-
mation of Boltzmann factors, with a ﬁxed conﬁguration
of η’s on the root tetrahedron.

FIG. 25. (color online). (a) A schematic ﬁgure of half cactus,
obtained by terminating the tetrahedron Husimi cactus at site
O. (b)-(e) The conﬁgurations of η’s on the root tetrahedron,
corresponding to the partial partition function, (b) z4, (c)
z3A, (d) z3B and (e) z2. ± signs correspond to η = ±1.

As shown in Fig. 25 (b), we deﬁne z4 as the partial sum
of Boltzmann factors, provided all η’s have the same sign
on the root tetrahedron. Similarly, we deﬁne z3A, z3B
and z2 as the partial summation with the 3-in 1-out or
2-in 2-out conﬁgurations on the root tetrahedron. We
distinguish z3A and z3B: For the former, the root site
has a minority spin, while not for the latter. Taking
account of the degeneracy of conﬁgurations on the root
tetrahedron, we obtain

z = 2z4 + 6z3B + 6z2 + 2z3A.

(D1)

The remarkable feature of the half cactus is its self-
similarity. By removing the root tetrahedron, one can
generate three separate copies of the original half cactus
network. By using this feature, one can prove that the
partial partition functions satisfy the following recursive
relations:



z2 = (cid:2)z4 + 3z3B + 3z2 + z3A(cid:3)3
z3A = e−4β( 1

,

(D2)

.

By solving these equations, we can get three ratios,
z4/z2, z3B/z2 and z3A/z2, which will serve as basic build-
ing blocks to obtain thermodynamic quantities, as we
discuss below.

2. Occupation rate

Next, we consider the probability that a particular spin
conﬁguration is realized in a single tetrahedron. The

p2 = e−16β( 1
p1 = e−4β( 1

probability that double charge, single charge, and vac-
uum state is realized in a certain tetrahedron, is propor-
tional to p2, p1, and p0, respectively, which are given by
2 −J)(cid:2)e−16βJ z4 + 3e−8βJz3B + 3z2 + e8βJ z3A(cid:3)4
2 −J)(cid:2)e−8βJ z4 + 3e−4βJz3B + 3z2 + e4βJ z3A(cid:3)3
× (cid:2)e8βJz4 + 3e4βJz3B + 3z2 + e−4βJ z3A(cid:3)
(D3)

p0 = (cid:2)z4 + 3z3B + 3z2 + z3A(cid:3)4
in which z4, z3B, z2 and z3A are the solution of the self-
consistent equation (D2).

3. Correlation function

In order to evaluate physical quantities, such as spe-
ciﬁc heat and magnetic susceptibility, one needs spin or
charge correlation function. To obtain these quantities,
we need the conditional probability, PN (ζ′|ζ): the prob-
ability that the tetrahedron TN takes the state ζ′, given
that T0 is in the state ζ.

With PN (ζ′|ζ), one can write down the spin correlation

between site i and j:

hηiηji = X

ζ,ζ ′

PN (ζ′|ζ)ηαi [ζ]ηαj [ζ′].

(D5)

Here, we assumed the site i (j) belongs to the sublattice
αi (αj ) of tetrahedron T0 (TN ).

And similarly, the charge correlation between the

tetrahedra, T0 and TN :

hQT0 QTNi = X

ζ,ζ ′

PN (ζ′|ζ)Q[ζ]Q[ζ′],

(D6)

To obtain PN (ζ′|ζ), one can resort to the method of
transfer matrix. Suppose a 16 × 16 matrix, K, whose
(ζ, ζ′) component, K(ζ|ζ′) means the conditional proba-
bility that the tetrahedron Tj+1 takes the state ζ, given
that Tj is in the state ζ′. This probability does not de-
pend on the index j. PN (ζN|ζ0) can be expressed as
PN (ζN|ζ0) = X
= K N

K(ζN|ζN −1)K(ζN −1|ζN −2)··· K(ζ1|ζ0)

ζ1···ζN −1

With the eigenvalue of K, λγ, and corresponding right

and left eigenvectors as uγ and vγ, one can write

To evaluate internal energy, the thermal expectation
value of square charge, hQ2
pi, and nearest-neighbor charge
correlation, hQpQqi are required. These quantities can
be easily obtained from the equation (D6). We can ob-
tain speciﬁc heat C by taking the numerical derivative
of E/Nsite in terms of temperature. We also estimate
MQ.Q, deﬁned with eq. (16), from hQpQqi. These quan-
tities are plotted in Fig. 18, together with the results of
Monte Carlo simulation.

5. Magnetic susceptibility

The magnetic susceptibility, χz, can be obtained from
the spin correlation introduced in equation (D5). By us-
ing the anisotropy axis dα associated with each sublat-
tice, α, one can write

Appendix E: Dynamical processes

For convenience, we summarize the important dynam-
ical processes and the energy barriers, ∆m, associated
with each process. ∆m is deﬁned as ∆m = Ef
m − Ei
m,
where Ef(i)
m is the total energy of the system after (be-
fore) the process m takes place.
(1) Creation of a “vacuum pair” from the [111] saturated
state by ﬂipping a spin in the kagome plane

∆1 = −4 − 20J.

pair created in process (1)

and double charge becomes a pair of vacuum tetrahedron

Appendix G: Absence of Hall eﬀect in the charge

crystal

We can show that the Hall conductivity vanishes for
the FCSL, on the basis of spatial symmetry of this state.
To prove this, it is instructive ﬁrst to consider the case of
all-in/all-out crystal [Fig. 29]. Here, we deﬁne all-in (all-
out) crystal as the state where all the upward tetrahedra
take the all-in (all-out) conﬁguration.

Firstly, the transverse conductivity σxy satisﬁes the

(G3)

Appendix F: Second plateau

For small negative J: −0.2 < J < 0.0, the magnetiza-
tion exhibits a wide plateau until it is terminated due to
the pair creation and dissociation processes of charges.
Here, we note one additional feature appearing in the
plateau region. At low enough temperatures, the plateau
splits into two regions, as shown in Fig. 27. The magne-
tization ﬁrst drops to a value M ∗ ∼ 0.198, then M stays
the same value for a certain time range. After a while, the
magnetization shows partial relaxation, and exhibits the
second plateau. After a long time determined from the
pair creation process, the second plateau also collapses.
As temperature is raised, this ﬁrst plateau shrinks, i.e.,
the collapse of ﬁrst plateau occurs earlier at higher tem-
perature, and it ﬁnally merges with the initial drop of
magnetization.

The origin of this ﬁrst plateau can be attributed to
the dissociation process of non-contractible charge pairs.
For negative J, charges with opposite sign attract with
each other in the nearest-neighbor sites, which leads
to the energy barrier ∆4 = 4|J| for their dessociation.
Consequently, once two charges are trapped in a non-
contractible position, it will take quite a long time to
overcome the energy barrier to escape from that posi-
tion. This mechanism is similar to that of slow relaxation
found in the dipolar spin ice model, where the energy bar-
rier is attributed to the long-range dipolar interaction23.
As plotted in Fig. 28, the time necessary to termi-
nate the ﬁrst plateau is well ﬁtted by an Arrehnius law:
exp(∆4/T ), with the value of energy barrier associated
with the dissociation process.

On the basis of this property, we prove that Hall con-
ductivity vanishes in the all-in/all-out ordered state. To
begin with, we note that the all-out state is obtained by
reversing all the spin directions from the all-out state. In
other words, T : Time-reversal operation maps the all-
in state to the all-out state, and vice versa. Next, we
deﬁne the spatial operation R, by combining rotational
and translational operations. Firstly, we consider the
90◦ rotation (of spin and position) around an line paral-
lel to z-axis, and through one of the sites with sublattice
B [Fig. 29]. Then, we successively translate the system
by R0. This combined operation, R, maps a group of β-
chains to those perpendicular to the former. At the same
time, this operation interchanges the upward and down-
ward tetrahedra, and accordingly, map the all-in state to
the all-out state, and vice versa. From the viewpoint of
Jy and Ex, the operation, R, acts as

Jy → −Jx,

Ex → Ey.

(G4)

So, the combination of T and R, maps the all-in and
all-out states to themselves. Consequently, T R (or RT )
does not change the value of σxy. Meanwhile, T R (or
RT ) map

Jy → Jx,

Ex → Ey.

Accordingly, we have

So, σyx = σxy, and consequently, σH

Jy = σxyEx → Jx = σxyEy.
xy = 0.

(G5)

(G6)

The same proof holds, if the exchange of upward and
downward tetrahedra can be considered equivalent to
time-reversal operation. In the FCSL, the upward and

23

highlighted with a yellow circle. The energy barriers associated with each processes are listed as equations (E1) to (E9).

downward tetrahedra are occupied with 3-in 1-out and 1-
in 3-out conﬁgurations, or vice versa. Accordingly, while
the FCSL is spin-disordered state, on a macroscopic scale,
the exchange of upward and downward tetrahedra lead to
the time-reversal conjugate state of initial state, resulting
in the absence of Hall signal in FCSL.

Appendix H: Collapse of jellyﬁsh

The jellyﬁsh structure is quite stable. Accordingly, the
toroidal moment associated with its ring part has quite
a long lifetime. Here, we discuss two dominant processes
which collapse the ring structure and destroy the toroidal
moment, accordingly. Both processes lead to a lifetime
of the order of at least ∼ exp(J1/T ) = exp(1/T ). Ac-
cordingly, this structure has a quite long lifetime at suf-

energy barriers

a.

double charge-vacuum creation

Since the jellyﬁsh is composed of the single charges
with the same sign, it is subject to the creation of double
charge-vacuum pair from the adjacent two single charges.
In particular, if it happens in the ring part, this event
immediately disturbs the chiral magnetization ﬂow. The
energy cost for this pair creation, ∆p−c, is estimated as

FIG. 30. (color online) The schematic ﬁgure of jellyﬁsh with
two branches, each of which has one charge, respectively. The
magnetization ﬂow is shown with red arrows. The reversal of
spin a costs the energy ∆p−c = 4(1 − J). Meanwhile the
energy cost of reversing spin b takes the lowest possible value,
∆min

p−c = 4(1 − 3J).

∆p−c = 4(1 − J), if the jellyﬁsh has no branches.
In
case the branches take the optimal conﬁguration for the
collapse, it is reduced to ∆min
p−c = 4(1 − 3J), but still this
lower-bound value takes ∼ 1 near J = 1/4, so this decay
process hardly occurs at T ≪ 1.

b.

pair annihilation of opposite charges

Pair annihilations of opposite charges is another pos-
sible process leading to the decay of jellyﬁsh. Due to the

topological constraint, the total charges in the system
must be equal to zero. Accordingly, if there is a jelly-
ﬁsh composed of a certain numbers of positive charges,
there must be the same numbers of negative charges else-
where in the system, which is likely to form a jellyﬁsh or
methane cluster to lower their energy, near J = 1/4.
Under the circumstances, to destroy the positive jelly-
ﬁsh, one can consider the following three-step process:
(i) one monopole is detached from the negative jelly-
ﬁsh/methane, (ii) it migrates to the positive jellyﬁsh, and
(iii) makes a pair-annihilation with one of the positive
charges composing the target positive jellyﬁsh.

25

Appendix I: Eﬀects of charge rings on structure

factor

To consider how the jellyﬁsh aﬀects the magnetic struc-
ture factor, we evaluate the contribution from the ring
part of jellyﬁsh to the spin correlation function. Namely,
we calculate

Sring(q) = hSring

q

· Sring
−q i,

(I1)

The energy barrier accompanying (i) is at least 4J. (iii)
also leads to the energy barrier of 4J, since it requires the
opposite charges to be placed in nearest-neighbor sites.
So the total energy cost for this pair-annihilation, ∆p−a,
is estimated as ∆p−a = 8J. However, if there are ﬁnite
numbers of stray charges, possibly due to thermal exci-
tation, the step (i) is not necessary. In this case, ∆p−a is
reduced to ∆min
p−a = 4J, and it gives a comparable value
to the lower bound of double charge-vacuum creation en-
ergy barrier: ∆min

p−a ∼ ∆min

p−c ∼ 1, near J = 1/4.

2. kinematic constraint

In addition to the energy barriers discussed above,
there are substantial contributions from the kinematic
constraint. Firstly, the double charge-vacuum creation
costs the energy ∆p−c ≥ ∆min
p−c = 4(1 − 3J). However,
the lower-bound value, ∆min
p−c is available, only if a special
conﬁguration is realized on a ring [see Fig. 30], which is
statistically rare.

Secondly,

the lifetime estimated from the pair-
annihilation process also requires substantial kinematic
correction. This process involves the migration of charge,
which we call step (ii) above. If the charge density is low,
the charge has to migrate for quite a long time until it
successfully go overs the energy barrier due to the step
(iii).

These kinematic features contrast with the dynamics
at J < 0, where the dynamical bottleneck is given by
a single energy barrier in most cases, and the dynamics
after overcoming the barrier is avalanche-like. The kine-
matic constraints give a substantially large correction to
the lifetime ∼ exp(1/T ) estimated purely from energetic
consideration, and contributes to the stability of jellyﬁsh
structures.

the sublattice indices and the relative positions from the cen-
ter of the hexagon are shown.

The ring part can be classiﬁed into four types, accord-
ing to its orientation: the hexagonal ring is perpendicular
to [111], [1-1-1], [-11-1] and [-1-11]. We assume these four
types of rings are equally populated, without any corre-
lations on their positions. For each ring, we take account
of the contribution from the 18 site-cluster, as shown,
in Fig. 31. For example, from the ring perpendicular to
[111], we obtain

S[111]
q ∝ ηch[dB sin(q · (eC − eD)) + dC sin(q · (eD − eB)) + dD sin(q · (eB − eC))]

+ ηpn[dB sin(q · (eC + eD − 2eB)) + dC sin(q · (eD + eB − 2eC)) + dD sin(q · (eB + eC − 2eD))
+ dA{sin(q · (eB + eC − eD − eA)) + sin(q · (eC + eD − eB − eA)) + sin(q · (eD + eB − eC − eA))}].

(I3)

Here, e{i=A,B,C,D} means the internal coordinate of sub-

lattice A, B, C, D within a unit cell. The ﬁrst term in

(I3) comes from the hexagonal ring, and ηch = ±1 deter-
mines the chirality of the spins. The other terms come
from the outer part, and ηpn = ±1 means the sign of
constituent charges.
