Abstract Random unimodular lattice triangulations have been recently used as an
embedded random graph model, which exhibit a crossover behaviour between an or-
dered, large-world and a disordered, small-world behaviour. Using the ergodic Pach-
ner ﬂips that transform such triangulations into another and an energy functional that
corresponds to the degree distribution variance, Markov chain Monte-Carlo simula-
tions can be applied to study these graphs. Here, we consider the spectra of the adja-
cency and the Laplacian matrix as well as the algebraic connectivity and the spectral
radius. Power law dependencies on the system size can clearly be identiﬁed and com-
pared to analytical solutions for periodic ground states. For random triangulations
we ﬁnd a qualitative agreement of the spectral properties with well-known random
graph models. In the microcanonical ensemble analytical approximations agree with
numerical simulations. In the canonical ensemble a crossover behaviour can be found
for the algebraic connectivity and the spectral radius, thus combining large-world and
small-world behavior in one model. The considered spectral properties can be applied
to transport problems on triangulation graphs and the crossover behaviour allows a
tuning of important transport quantities.

1 Introduction

Many real world systems consist of a set of equivalent objects and the pairwise in-
teraction among themselves, so that they can be described approximately in terms of
graph theory [59,17]. Excluding all quantitative aspects of the interactions and tak-
ing only into account whether two objects interact or not, the considered objects are

interpreted as the node of a graph, where edges exist between objects or nodes that do
interact. Examples for such systems are neural networks in biology, where dendrites
are modelled as nodes and axons between two dendrites are modelled as edges; or
the world-wide-web, where an edge between two website nodes exist if there is a link
from one website to the other.

A major tool in studying the physical properties of such graphs is spectral graph
theory, which examines the spectra of the adjacency and the Laplacian matrices asso-
ciated with the graph and some special eigenvalues of those, see e.g. [18]. The spectra
of graphs are studied e.g. for quantum percolation [30] and Anderson transition on
Bethe lattices [52,31,32] in terms of random matrices, as well as in biology [10] and
chemistry [71,28], for a review see [54] and the references therein. Special eigenval-
ues as the algebraic connectivity, the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplacian
matrix, are important for characterizing the topology of graphs [42], for transport
and dynamics on networks [4] and for optimisation problems [56,72], see [55,1]
for reviews. Additionally, spectral graph theory is well-connected with the common
mathematical theory of random matrices used in quantum physics [38]. An important
application of the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix are (quantum) random walks on
networks [14,57], where the Laplacian matrix corresponds to the discretization of the
operator used in Poisson and Schr¨odinger equations. In both cases the spectrum can
be used for calculating return probabilities and inverse participation ratios.

For understanding and modelling the important features of real world networks
artiﬁcially constructed graphs can be used, mainly random graphs [2]. Common ex-
amples are the Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph [25,26,27], the Watts-Strogatz random
graph [75] (and a slightly altered version denoted as Newman-Watts random graph
[60]) and the Barab´asi-Albert random graph [11]. These random graphs were mainly
constructed and optimised for creating models for real small-world and scale-free
networks, but also their spectral properties arise much interest [58,4].

Recently, a new type of (embedded) random graph model was proposed by us-
ing canonical ensembles of unimodular lattice triangulations [47]. Random lattice
triangulations are comparable with the usual random graph models; in the canoni-
cal ensemble a crossover behaviour from ordered triangulations showing large-world
to disordered triangulations exhibiting small-world and scale-free behaviour can be
found. The triangulations used are tessellations of the convex hull of a given point
set into triangles that do not intersect [19]. Triangulations have been used as random-
graphs before [6,81,67,7,46,3], but only the topological degrees of freedom were
used there. In contrast to these models the actual coordinates of the nodes become
important in lattice triangulations [47], which adds some (numerical) difﬁculties, but
can be a concept useful in real networks where spatial coordinates of nodes and the
induced length of the edges become important. The considered lattice triangulations
are maximal planar graphs in the sense that no interior edge can be inserted without
violating the planarity. Furthermore, one can always ﬁnd an embedding of a planar
graph with rational coordinates, by choosing ﬁrst an arbitrary embedding with real
coordinates and then wiggling the non-rational ones, since the rational numbers are
dense in the reals. By scaling one can ﬁnd an embedding with integer coordinates, so
lattice triangulations can be considered as the supergraphs of all planar graphs.

Triangulations in general are used in quantum geometry for describing curved
space-times in the approaches of causal dynamical triangulations [5] and in spin
foams [65]. In topology and geometry one is interested in the number of triangu-
lations of manifolds [69]. They can also be used as a tool for studying foams [70,61,
8,23], since the Voronoi tessellation is the dual of the Delaunay triangulation, which
is a special triangulation of a point set.

In this paper we extend the results of [47] by considering spectral properties of
lattice triangulations in order to relate graphs to physical properties. We measure the
spectra of the adjacency and the Laplacian matrix of random triangulations, which
is the ensemble of all triangulations with constant weights, using Metropolis Monte
Carlo simulations, and compare the results with common models of random graphs.
Deﬁning an energy of a triangulation, which is well known in the literature, and that
corresponds to the variance of the degree distribution (the histogram of the node de-
grees, which is the number of incident edges), we calculate the microcanonical and
canonical expectation values of the algebraic connectivity and the spectral radius
with Metropolis and Wang-Landau simulations. For the maximal ordered triangula-
tions, which are the ground state of the energy functional used, analytical calculations
are possible, as well as approximations for triangulations with low energies near the
ground state. As an application of our results, we calculate the inverse participation
ratio of certain eigenstates and show that random lattice triangulations on average
exhibit stronger localization than comparable random graphs.

2 Triangulations and spectral graph theory

2.1 Unimodular lattice triangulations
In this section we follow the notations of [19,47]. Let A = {x1, . . .xK},xi ∈ R2 be
a ﬁnite set of points in the plane and let conv(A) be the convex hull of this point
set A. A triangulation T (A) of the point set A is a tessellation of conv(A) into
triangles σi ∈ A3 generated by three points of A, so that ﬁrstly the interiors σi \ ∂σi
and σ j \ ∂σ j of two distinct triangles σi (cid:54)= σ j do not intersect and so that secondly
each point is corner point of at least one triangle. Sometimes the second deﬁning
property is dropped and triangulations that fulﬁl this property are called full. In this
paper we consider only full triangulations of two-dimensional integer M × N-lattices

A =(cid:26)(cid:18)m

n(cid:19) | m ∈ ZM := {0,1, . . . ,M − 1},n ∈ ZN(cid:27) .

These triangulations are unimodular, that is that all triangles have equal area 1/2.
Examples of such triangulations can be found in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Each triangulation
is also a simplicial complex if one includes for each triangle σi = {xi1,xi2,xi3} ∈ T
the 1-simplices (edges) {xi1,xi2}, {xi1,xi3} and {xi2,xi3} that consist of two of the
triangle points, and the 0-simplices (vertices) {xi1}, {xi2} and {xi3} consisting of one
point.
One special triangulation used throughout this paper is the maximal ordered tri-
angulation. It is deﬁned as the full triangulation of the M×N integer lattice where the

4

vertex with coordinates (i, j) is connected with at most six vertices with coordinates
(i, j± 1), (i± 1, j) and (i± 1, j± 1) whenever these coordinates are in ZM or ZN re-
spectively. Note that postulating connections to vertices with coordinates (i±1, j±1)
is a convention, one could also use connections to (i± 1, j∓ 1) instead. The maximal
ordered lattice is often denoted as triangular lattice in the literature.
To determine the number of possible triangulations of an integer lattice is a non-
trivial question. There are exact enumeration results and analytical bounds [43] as
well as numerical approximations of this number [45] using Monte-Carlo simula-
tions, both show that there are exponentially many triangulations in terms of the
system size M × N. So lattice triangulations are extensive and can be treated as a
well-deﬁned statistical system. Additionally the convergence of Glauber dynamics
on lattice triangulations was examined in [15,68] for different parameter sets.

A graph can be constructed from a triangulation by using the 0-simplices (ver-
tices) as graph nodes and the 1-simplices (edges) as graph edges. In the notation of
graph theory triangulations are planar, which is trivial since the graphs are deﬁned
in the actual embedding into an euclidean plane, they are even maximal planar with
respect to the convex hull of the vertices, i.e. that by including an arbitrary other edge
between two nodes that does not leave the convex hull of the vertices the planarity of
the triangulation graph is violated.

In order to calculate ensemble averages using Markov-chain Monte Carlo simula-
tions some elementary moves have to be deﬁned that are able to sample all triangula-
tions of a given point set ergodically, so that every triangulation can be reached from
every other triangulation in terms of these moves. For triangulations Pachner ﬂips
[62] can be used as such an elementary move. For a Pachner ﬂip select an interior
edge {xi,x j} of the triangulation. This edge is a common edge of the two neighbour-
ing triangles {xi,x j,xk} and {xi,x j,xl}. If the quadrangle {xi,x j,xk,xl} is convex (in
lattice triangulations, this is equivalent with the quadrangle being a parallelogram),
the Pachner ﬂip is the replacement

{xi,x j,xk},{xi,x j,xl} → {xi,xk,xl},{x j,xk,xl}.

(1)

If the quadrangle is not convex (i.e. there is a ﬂat or concave angle), the ﬂip is not exe-
cutable and must be discarded. Such an exclusion of a ﬂip due to non-convexity does
not occur in topological triangulations as considered in [46,7], because there only
topological degrees of freedom are considered, i.e. the connection structure of the
vertices; the actual coordinates of the vertices and therewith concavity and convexity
depend on the actual embedding and cannot be considered. (Note that in topologi-
cal triangulations ﬂips that would include already present edges must be excluded.)
In Fig. 1 some executable and non-executable ﬂips are displayed in a small lattice
triangulation. The ergodicity of the Pachner ﬂips (1) for triangulations of arbitrary
two-dimensional point sets was proven in [49], they also conserve the unimodularity
of the triangulations as well as the number of vertices and edges. There are additional
Pachner moves [62] that consist of inserting or removing vertices of a triangulation,
but these are not needed for ergodicity in our setup and lead to non-full triangulations
which are no longer unimodular.

Fig. 1 (Color online) Pachner moves in lattice triangulations. Every black, solid edge can be ﬂipped
into the other diagonal of the quadrangle consisting of the two triangles incident with this edge. The red,
dashed edges cannot be ﬂipped because they would lead to structures that are not triangulations. The ﬂips
associated with the grey quadrangles are executed from left to right and vice versa. Note that the ﬂippability
of an edge can change if neighbouring edges are ﬂipped.

To be able to use ensembles of triangulations that are weighted in terms of their

order or disorder, we introduce the energy function

E(T ) := J ∑

v∈A(cid:16)k(T )

v − k(T0)

v

(cid:17)2

(2)

v

v

v

for a triangulation T with k(T )
being the number of incident edges at vertex v. The
triangulation T0 is a reference triangulation and at the same time the ground state
of the energy function. Throughout the paper we use the maximal ordered triangu-
lation as reference triangulation, which is displayed in Fig. 2. The introduction of
the reference term k(T0)
may seem somewhat randomly, but if one uses an energy
function ∝ ∑v∈A k(T )
the contribution of boundary vertices would make a disordered
triangulation the ground state of the energy function. This would conﬂict with the
energy measuring order and disorder of a system. Another interpretation of intro-
ducing the maximal ordered triangulation as reference state is that it introduces a
ﬁxed layer of triangulations around the miscellaneous triangulations (see Fig. 2) that
cannot be ﬂipped and whose vertices are not taken into account for calculating the
energy, which leads to ﬁxed boundary conditions. Note that it is not possible to use
periodic boundary conditions (i.e. using a triangulation on a torus) for embedded tri-
angulations, because the line segment between two points is not deﬁned uniquely
on a torus, and so one cannot decide whether a quadrangle is convex. Examples for
triangulations with different energy can be found in Fig. 2.

Since all full triangulations of a given point set have the same number of vertices,
edges and triangles, and since the number of triangles incident with a vertex depends
only on the number of edges incident, the energy function (2) is the simplest possible
local and polynomial energy function in terms of these topological numbers (taking
the linear term would lead to a constant energy function). The same energy function
was used for triangulations in [47,45], a modiﬁcation using the average number of
adjacent edges instead of the reference term was used in [9,46,7] for topological
triangulations. It can also be applied to usual graphs as in [33] and is related to the
integrated squared curvature used in the discrete form of the Einstein-Hilbert action
in the approaches of (causal) dynamical triangulations [5].

2.2 Spectral graph theory

An undirected simple graph G := (A,E) is a pair consisting of a set A (called vertices)
with n = |A| elements and a set E (called edges) of two-element subsets of A. A
triangulation can be interpreted as a graph using the point set A as vertices and the
1-simplices of the triangulation as edges E.

Important properties of graphs can be found by examining spectral properties (the
set of eigenvalues) of matrices associated with graphs. In the literature mostly the
following three n× n-matrices (with n being the number of vertices) are considered
for a graph G [16]:
– The adjacency matrix A(G ) with

A(G )i j :=(cid:40)1

0

{vi,v j} ∈ E
{vi,v j} /∈ E

is a traceless, symmetric matrix that indicates whether two different vertices are
connected. The matrix elements A(G )k
i j equal the number of paths from vi to v j
containing exactly k edges. We will denote its sorted eigenvalues by α0 ≤ α1 ≤
··· ≤ αn−1.
– The Laplacian matrix L(G ) := D(G )− A(G ) with degree matrix

D(G )i j := δi jkvi

is a discretization of the usual Laplace operator ∇2. The Laplacian matrix is sym-
metric and positive-semideﬁnite, the smallest eigenvalue is always 0. We denote
the sorted eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix by λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ ··· ≤ λn−1. The mul-
tiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is the number of connected components of the graph.
– The normalised Laplacian matrix

L (G ) := 1− D(G )−1/2A(G )D(G )−1/2

Spectral properties of unimodular lattice triangulations

7

is useful for describing random walks on arbitrary geometries. This matrix is
not considered in this paper, but our calculations can be extended simply to the
normalised Laplacian.
The spectrum specM(x) of a n×n-matrix M with eigenvalues µ0, . . . , µn−1 is given

by the distribution

specM(x) :=

1
n

n−1
∑
i=0

δ (x− µi)

For large graphs (n → ∞) the spectrum can be approximated by a continuous function.
A well known result is that the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix can be used to
calculate the number of spanning trees, which is λ1·λ2·····λn−1/n [44]. The second-
smallest eigenvalues λ1 of the Laplacian spectrum is called algebraic connectivity,
the largest eigenvalue λn−1 is called spectral radius. The algebraic connectivity is 0
if and only if the graph is not connected, it can be shown that it increases if one inserts
additional vertices into a graph, so it is in fact a good measure for the connectedness
of a graph. Additionally it can be used to bound other quantities of graphs that are
more difﬁcult to calculate, e.g. the isoperimetric number [53]. Fiedler [35] and Mo-
har [54] state that there are the following lower and upper bounds for the algebraic
connectivity λ1 of a graph G :

2η(G )(cid:104)1− cos(cid:16)π

n(cid:17)(cid:105) < λ1(G ) < v(G )

Here η(G ) is the edge connectivity and v(G ) is the vertex connectivity, the smallest
number of edges or vertices (with incident edges) that must be removed from the
graph to create at least two non-connected components. For the spectral radius λn−1
there are the following general bounds ([54,80]) for a graph G :

(3)

(4)

n
n− 1

max{ki | vi ∈ A} ≤ λn−1(G ) ≤ max(cid:8)ki + k j | {vi,v j} ∈ G(cid:9)

where ki is the degree (number of incident edges) of vertex vi.

One can show that the algebraic connectivity is proportional to the inverse of the
synchronization time in consensus dynamics on networks [4]. Additionally, for the
return probability it governs the large-time in classical and the small frequency be-
haviour in quantum random walks on networks, whereas the spectral radius governs
short-time, respectivly, the large frequency behaviour [58]. It is also possible to ﬁnd a
bound for the sum of the j largest eigenvalues in terms of the k-largest vertex degrees
[37]. The sum of the exponentiated eigenvalues of the adjacency and the Laplacian
matrix is known as the (Laplacian) Estrada index and has many applications in the
study of chemical molecules [28,29,22].

The eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix can be used for examining localization
on graphs in terms of the inverse participation ration (IPR) χm of the normalized
eigenvector |m(cid:105) corresponding to eigenvalue λm [13,57], which is given by

χm := ∑

k

4

(|m(cid:105)k)

,

(5)

8

Benedikt Kr¨uger et al.

where |m(cid:105)k denotes the k-th component of the eigenvector. Since the normal basis cor-
responds to the vertices of the graph, these components are the overlap of the eigen-
vectors and the vertices, so large IPRs correspond to strong localization, whereas
small IPRs correspong to delocalization of the corresponding eigenvector. To exam-
ine the localization properties for lattice triangulations, we consider the IPR χ1 of
the algebraic connectivity, the IPR χMN−1 of the spectral radius and the average IPR
χ := (∑m χm)/MN.

2.3 Random graphs

In this paper we compare the graph interpretation of unimodular lattice triangulations
with some common random graph models. Similar to [47] where graph measures as
the clustering coefﬁcient (which is the average ratio of the numbers of actual present
and possible edges between the neighbours of a node) and the average shortest path
length (the shortest path length between two nodes is the minimal number of edges
that have to be run through to go from the one to the other node within the graph)
were compared to these random graph models, we choose the respective parameters
of the random graph models such that the average numbers of nodes and edges are
equal to the number MN of triangulation vertices and to the number 3MN − 2(M +
N) + 1 of triangulation edges for comparing the spectral properties. In the following
we describe shortly the different models of random graphs we are comparing the
lattice triangulation graphs to, as well as our choice of parameters for these random
graphs.

Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph The earliest model of a random graph is the Erd¨os-R´enyi
random graph Gn,p with n vertices and the probability p for two distinct vertices to
be connected [25,26,27]. Since the average number of edges in this random graph is
pn(n− 1)/2 we choose the parameters

n = MN and pER =

3MN − 2(M + N) + 1

MN(MN − 1)/2

M,N→∞
−−−−−→

6
MN

(6)

to get an Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph with a comparable number of nodes and edges.
Erd¨os and R´enyi [25] categorised the random graphs Gn,p according to the asymp-
totics of the average number np of edges incident with a vertex. For our choice of
parameters (6) with np → 6 they found that the graph has one giant component with
n· (1− 2.5· 10−3) vertices on average, and n· 0.25· 10−3 connected components for
np = 6 and n → ∞. The latter result implies that the average Erd¨os-R´enyi random
graph is not connected for a sufﬁcient high number of vertices for our choice of
parameters, in contrast to the considered lattice triangulations which are always con-
nected.

Watts-Strogatz and Newman-Watts random graph Another common random graph
model was proposed by Newmann and Watts [60]. It consists of a regular graph on a
periodic lattice of n vertices (a ring in one dimension), where each vertex is connected

Spectral properties of unimodular lattice triangulations

9

with its L = 2k·d nearest neighbours (with d being the dimension of the lattice and in-
teger k), superimposed with a Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph with connection probability
p. Numerical calculations for a similiar model [75] showed that there is a crossover
region in the parameter p where this model shows a small-world (but not scale-free)
behaviour.

For a Newman-Watts random graph with n = MN nodes the requirement of the
average number of edges to match the number of triangulation edges implies the
rewiring probability p:

|E| =

1
2

LMN +

1
2

pMN(MN − L− 1) ⇒ p =

(6− L)MN − 4(M + N) + 2

MN(MN − L− 1)

Since no edges are deleted in the Newman-Watts model, the number of edges in the
original regular lattice must be smaller than the number of edges in the triangulation.
For the 1d Newman-Watts model this implies L = 2 or L = 4, for the 2d model one
has to choose L = 4. In the further considerations we will only use the 1d case with
L = 4, because for the two other cases the original regular lattice has only edges to
the nearest neighbours and a clustering coefﬁcient C(p = 0) = 0, which differs from
the behaviour of triangulations.

Barab´asi-Albert random graph Barab´asi and Albert [11] proposed a preferential at-
tachment random graph model with the following construction in order to achieve a
power-law degree distribution: Start from a graph of m vertices without edges. Then
execute t of the following steps: Insert one vertex and edges from this vertex to m
existing vertices so that the probability pi for an edge between vertex vi and the new
vertex is proportional to the node degree ki. Hence vertices with high vertex degree
have a high probability to be linked to the new vertex (preferential attachment). The
resulting graph consists of n = m +t vertices and m·t edges.
To compare the Barab´asi-Albert random graph to a random triangulation on an
M × N integer lattice, we choose m = 3 and t = MN − 3 so that the corresponding
Barab´asi-Albert random graph has 3MN vertices and MN − 9 edges. The number of
vertices matches the number of triangulation vertices, for M,N (cid:29) 1 also the number
of edges match.

3 Analytical solution

If one extends the ground state to periodic boundaries (resulting in a periodic, trian-
gular lattice), also analytical solutions for the eigenvalues of the adjacency and the
Laplacian matrix can be found. It is even possible to use perturbation theory to cal-
culate the effect of ﬂips on the spectrum and therewith to approximate the spectral
properties of low-energy triangulations.

Adjacency and Laplacian spectrum (ground state) In this section we calculate the
spectrum of the adjacency and the Laplacian matrix for a triangular M × N-lattice
graph with periodic boundary conditions. This is an approximation for the ground

The eigenvalues and (up to a scaling factor) the eigenvectors depend only on the
relative indices m/M and n/N. So the spectrum as visualised in Fig. 3 is independent

which are visualised in Fig. 3. These Laplacian eigenvalues of a periodic triangular
lattice were also found in [40]. The lowest eigenvector λ0 = λ0,0 is zero since the
triangulation is connected. The algebraic connectivity λ1 is

The absolute value of all components of the eigenvectors (9) is (MN)−1, this
implies that the inverse participation ratio of every eigenvector and also the average
IPR takes its minimal value χ = χm = (MN)−1.

Adjacency and Laplacian spectrum (low energy states) As a next step we use the
usual quantum mechanical perturbation theory to calculate analytically the inﬂuence
of a single and multiple ﬂips on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator. Consider
a ﬂip of the edge {(a,b)(a− 1,b + 1)} into the new edge {(a− 1,b)(a,b + 1)}. The
Laplacian operator L(cid:48) = L +V of the ﬂipped state can be calculated using the Lapla-
cian operator L of the ground state and a perturbation matrix V with the following
non-vanishing components:

Vab,ab = V(a−1)(b+1),(a−1)(b+1) = −1

V(a−1)b,(a−1)b = Va(b+1),a(b+1) = 1
Vab,(a−1)(b+1) = V(a−1)(b+1),ab = 1
V(a−1)b,a(b+1) = Va(b+1),(a−1)b = −1

In the following we consider only quadratic lattices M = N, the rectangular case
can be treated in an analogue fashion. For calculating the ﬁrst order correction for
the spectral radius one has to take into account that λN/3,2N/3 = λ2N/3,N/3 is two fold
degenerate, so one has to calculate the perturbation matrix and to diagonalise it. The
relevant terms of the perturbation matrix are the diagonal element

and the complex off-diagonal element

The eigenvalues of the resulting hermitian 2× 2-matrix are 0 and 6/N2, so in ﬁrst
order perturbation theory the spectral radius becomes

(13)

with the second being the important contribution since the spectral radius needs to
be the biggest eigenvalue. This relation will be used later on to estimate the energy
dependence of the spectral radius for small energies.

The perturbation theory unfortunately fails if one considers the algebraic connec-
tivity. For the case M = N the corresponding eigenvalue is six-fold degenerated and
the perturbation matrix has to be diagonalised numerically. This leads for all M,N to
a decrease in the algebraic connectivity, which is consistent with a direct diagonal-
isation of the new Laplacian L +V for the periodic case. In contrast to that, if one
diagonalises L +V directly for the non-periodic case, the algebraic connectivity in-
creases. So for the small eigenvalues the difference between a regular and a periodic
triangulation leads to a qualitative change in the behaviour of the algebraic connec-
tivity, which is quite comprehensible since the algebraic connectivity is dominated
by the vertices with low degree (two for non-periodic and six for periodic triangula-
tions), which can be seen already in the bounds (3). The spectral radius is determined
by the vertices with high degree, which is six for both periodic and non-periodic
triangulations, also apparent in the bounds (4).

4 Triangulation ensembles as random graph models

In this section we calculate spectral graph observables (Laplacian and adjacency
spectrum, algebraic connectivity and spectral radius) numerically for various en-
sembles of triangulations. Other graph observables as the degree distribution, the
clustering coefﬁcient and the average minimal path length were calculated before in
Ref. [47]. Let ΩA be the set of all possible triangulations of the given vertices A. An
ensemble is deﬁned as a map P : ΩA → [0,1] that assigns every possible triangulation
of A a weight so that ∑T ∈ΩA P(T ) = 1. An ensemble average of an observable O
can then be calculated using

(cid:104)O(cid:105) := ∑
T ∈ΩA

P(T )O(T )

(14)

This notion of ensembles was already applied to random graphs in [33].

In this paper we consider three different ensembles that are well-known in statis-

tical physics:

– The random ensemble assigns to each triangulation the constant probability P =
1/|ΩA| and can be viewed as a democratic sum since each triangulation con-
tributes in equal measure. This ensemble is independent of the deﬁnition of an
triangulation energy. Ensemble averages of the observable O in the random en-
semble will be denoted by (cid:104)O(cid:105)rnd or simply (cid:104)O(cid:105)
– The microcanonical ensemble at constant energy E assigns every triangulation
with energy E a constant probability, and every triangulation with a different en-
ergy the probability 0. This ensemble is a random ensemble in the subset of all
triangulations ΩA|E := {T ∈ ΩA | E(T ) = E} with energy E. Microcanonical
ensemble averages of an observable O at energy E will be denoted by (cid:104)O(cid:105)mc(E)
– The canonical ensemble at constant inverse temperature β assigns every triangu-
lation T with energy E the Boltzmann probability P(T ) = exp(−β E)/Z with
Z = ∑T ∈ΩA exp(−β E(T )). Formally one can deﬁne the canonical ensemble also
for negative temperatures β < 0. In the case of triangulations with the considered
energy functional (2) negative temperatures correspond to the usual positive tem-
peratures with negative coupling constant J < 0. The canonical ensemble at inﬁ-
nite temperature (β = 0) equals the ensemble of random triangulations. Canonical
ensemble averages of an observable O at inverses temperature β will be denoted
by (cid:104)O(cid:105)c(β )
Usually the set of all triangulations ΩA of the vertices A is too big to generate, so
calculating the ensemble average using Eq. (14) is impossible. So one has to restrict
to a suitable subset of all triangulations to approximate the ensemble average. For the
random ensemble one can simply generate randomly a certain number of triangula-
tions as the desired subset (simple sampling), for other ensembles the problem of the
simple sampling procedure is that in most cases only triangulations with low weights
P(T ) are encountered, and the probability to ﬁnd a highly contributing triangulation
is low. One better uses an importance sampling algorithm that preferentially selects
triangulations with a high ensemble weight.

14

Benedikt Kr¨uger et al.

The most common possibility called Metropolis Monte Carlo [51] is to create a
sequence of triangulations, a so-called Markov chain, so that the probability for a
triangulation to appear in the Markov chain equals the weight of this triangulation
in the ensemble. For the triangulation one generates the sequence by executing sin-
gle Pachner moves that transform a triangulation T1 into a triangulation T2 with a
probability P(T1 → T2) that is chosen so that
P(T1 → T2)
=
P(T2 → T1)

P(T1)
P(T2)

This equation commonly is denoted as the detailed balance condition. The step prob-
ability

P(T1 → T2) = S(T1 → T2)· A(T1 → T2)

is usually split into the probability S(T1 → T2) for selecting a given step T1 → T2
and the probability A(T1 → T2) for accepting a previously selected step. If choos-
ing the Pachner moves by choosing the ﬂip edge uniformly from the set of all interior
edges and using A = 0 for non-executable ﬂips, the contribution of the selection prob-
abilities cancels and one can use the standard Metropolis choice for the acceptance
probabilities [51]:

A(T1 → T2) = min(cid:20)1,

P(T2)

P(T1)(cid:21)

(15)

An important requirement for the use of the Metropolis or similar algorithms is that
the steps constructing the Markov chain must be ergodic, i.e. every two possible states
of the system must be connected by a ﬁnite number of steps with non-vanishing
step probability. The requirement is fulﬁlled for Pachner moves in two-dimensional
triangulations [49] as long as no step probability is chosen to be zero.

For the random ensemble the Metropolis acceptance probability (15) is always
equal to 1 due to the fact that every triangulation has the same weight. For the canon-
ical ensemble (15) the acceptance probability has the following well-known form:

A(T1 → T2) = min(cid:104)1,e−β∆E(T1→T2)(cid:105); ∆E(T1 → T2) := E(T2)− E(T1) (16)

Note that the sampling algorithm has to be modiﬁed for the microcanonical ensemble,
as described in Sec. 4.2. For the canonical ensemble we also do not use Metropolis,
but Wang-Landau sampling, which will be explained in details in Sec. 4.3.

4.1 Random triangulation

In this section we consider spectral graph observables of random lattice triangulations
and their scaling behaviour in terms of the size of the integer lattice. The results of
these calculations are especially interesting because they do not depend on the choice
of the energy functional, since every possible triangulation contributes with constant
weight.

The spectral observables of the random ensemble are calculated using the Metropo-
lis algorithm [51] averaging over more than 1000 different random triangulations.

Spectral properties of unimodular lattice triangulations

15

Due to the fact that every triangulation occurs in the random ensemble with constant
probability, the acceptance probability (15) used in the Metropolis algorithm is al-
ways 1, so every possible and suggested Pachner move will be executed. To obtain
a stationary distribution of random triangulations, we start with the maximal ordered
triangulation and propose 105M· N Pachner moves, which is well above the diameter
o(MN(M + N)) of the ﬂip graph [15] for the considered system sizes. In order to
avoid an inﬂuence of the autocorrelation of successive triangulations in the Markov
chain, we ensure that the number of steps between two measurements is larger than
100 autocorrelation times, which we measured to be smaller than 10M · N for the
considered spectral observables and system sizes, and which was measured for other
graph observables before in Ref. [47].

For the calculations in this paper we use only quadratic lattice sizes N × N; con-
sidering rectangular lattices is possible but does not change the results much, for
large lattices the only relevant parameter is the number of vertices M · N [47]. The
accessible system sizes are rather limited compared to topological triangulations [46,
7] for two reasons: First, one has to check whether a proposed ﬂip is executable
(compare Sec. 2.1), which can be done for two-dimensional lattice triangulations by
checking whether the two diagonals have the same mids, or by testing for convexity
in more general cases. These checks consume more computation time for a ﬂip than
in the topological case, where only incidences have to be looked up. Second, every
time encountering a non-executable ﬂip the triangulation remains unchanged, which
increases e.g. the autocorrelation time of the algorithm. Note that proposing only
executable ﬂips is not suitable, because this makes it difﬁcult to fulﬁll the detailed
balance. We were able to calculate the spectral properties of random triangulations
for system sizes between 4× 4 and 64× 64.
We compare the ensemble averages for random triangulations as graphs with the
Erd¨os-R´enyi, the Newman-Watts and the Barab´asi-Albert random graphs with pa-
rameters chosen according to Sec. 2.3, the generation of these random graphs was
done using the NetworkX framework [39].

Spectrum of the adjacency matrix For the Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph there are some
analytical results for the spectrum of the adjacency matrix. The random graph adja-
cency spectra are strongly related with the spectra of random matrices, which follows
in most cases a semi-circle distribution [76,77,41].

Numerical investigations showed that for constant edge probability p (cid:54)= 0,1 the
adjacency spectrum of the Erd¨os-R´enyi model converges to the semi-circle distribu-
tion up to the largest eigenvalue, but there are additional peaks for p ∝ n−1, which we
actually choose to compare with random triangulations (see [31,32] for investigations
on the level of random matrices and [12,34] for investigations on random graphs).

In Fig. 4 the probability density function (PDF) for the spectrum of the adja-
cency matrix of random triangulations is displayed in an index-resolved and an index-
summed way for different lattice sizes. The spectrum is compared with the spectra
of the maximal ordered triangulations and the Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph. Fig. 5 dis-
plays cuts through the random triangulation and the Erd¨os-R´enyi adjacency PDF for
the eigenvalue index i = MN/2 and the eigenvalue magnitude α = 0. The displayed

of the Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph with 322 vertices. One sees a convergence of the spectrum for increasing
system size. The index-summed PDF (b) is compared with the Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph and the spectrum
of the maximal ordered triangulation (dashed black line). The dotted lines in the index-resolved spectrum
show the cuts that are displayed in Fig. 5

PDFs are created using a kernel density estimation [64,63] with Gaussian kernel and
Silverman’s rule [66] for the width of the Gaussian.

The adjacency spectra of random and maximal ordered triangulations both have
a main peak around the eigenvalue magnitude of -2. The only difference is that at
α ≈ 0 the random PDF has a higher value than the maximal ordered one, and vice
versa at α ≈ 4.5.
In contrast to the random triangulations the numerically calculated adjacency
spectrum of the Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph is symmetric with respect to α ≈ 0 and
behaves like Wigner’s semicircle law with an additional peak at α = 0. The peak is
due to the eigenvalue αMN/2 = 0 occurring in all random graphs that were calculated
numerically and can also be seen as a small horizontal piece in the index-resolved
adjacency PDF.

Considering the values of the index-resolved PDF one can see for each eigenvalue
index a peaked distribution of the eigenvalue magnitudes with increasing height and
decreasing width for growing system size. One can assume that this is due to the
number of eigenvalues MN growing with the lattice sizes, but all having values in
a ﬁxed interval ≈ [−4,6]. This behaviour can be quantiﬁed using order statistics:
Assume that one draws n random variables Xi from a uniform distribution on the
ﬁxed interval [a,b] and sorts them so that Xi ≤ Xj for i < j. Then the probability
density function (PDF) for the Xk is given by the beta distribution

where ξ = k/(n− 1) denotes the relative index and Stirling’s formula was used for
calculating the asymptotics of the factorials. So one expects that the maximal value
of the PDF scales ∝ (MN)0.5 independently for each relative index ξ = k/(n− 1).
This is in fact the scaling behaviour that can be found in the Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 for the
adjacency spectrum.

Spectrum of the Laplacian matrix The same considerations as for the adjacency
spectrum can also be done for the Laplacian spectrum of random triangulations and
graphs. In Fig. 6 the index-resolved and index-summed probability density function
(PDF) for the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix of random triangulations is displayed.
For comparison also the Laplacian spectra of the maximal ordered triangulation and
an Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph with the same number of vertices are plotted. Fig. 7
displays cuts through the PDF for a given eigenvalue index and a given eigenvalue
magnitude. As for the spectra of the adjacency matrix, the PDFs are calculated using a
Gaussian kernel density estimation and normalised with the order statistics expected
maximal values (17).

If one compares the Laplacian random spectrum with the spectrum of the max-
imal ordered triangulation two main things differ: For the maximal ordered trian-
gulation the largest possible eigenvalue is 9 (as shown analytically for the periodic
maximal ordered triangulation), whereas the largest eigenvalues of the random tri-
angulations are much higher for increasing lattices sizes, which can be understood
in terms of the lower bound (4) of the spectral radius given by the maximal vertex

( ), Erd¨os-R´enyi ( ), Newman-Watts ( ) and Barab´asi-Albert ( ) random graphs for different number of
vertices MN. The displayed lines are power law ﬁts for the numerical data.

For the considered parameter set of Erd¨os-R´enyi random graphs there are ap-
proximative analytical calculations [20] for the spectrum of the Laplacian that coin-
cide with earlier numerical calculations [13]. Ding and Jiang [21] showed that the
spectrum of the adjacency matrix of a random (Erd¨os-R´enyi) graph converges to the
semi-circle distribution, and the spectrum of the Laplacian matrix converges to a free
convolution of the semi-circle distribution and a normal distribution.

The Laplacian spectrum of the Erd¨os-R´enyi random graph looks similar to the
spectrum of the triangulations for eigenvalue magnitudes bigger than 6, both exhibit
a linear density decrease for increasing eigenvalue magnitudes. For eigenvalue mag-
nitudes between 2 and 6 there are several peaks in the spectrum of the random trian-
gulation which also survive if one considers the limit MN → ∞, whereas the random
graph spectrum in this interval is nearly linear. Between eigenvalue magnitudes 0 and
2 the Laplacian spectrum of the random graph shows two peaks and three dips, while
the spectrum of the random triangulation is smooth at most for large lattice sizes.

Comparing the Laplacian spectra cuts of the random triangulations and the Erd¨os-
R´enyi random graphs with the expectations from the order statistics in Fig. 7, one can
ﬁnd similar results as in the case of the adjacency spectra.

Algebraic connectivity and spectral radius In this section we examine the depen-
dence of the smallest Laplacian eigenvalue λ1 (algebraic connectivity) and the biggest
Laplacian eigenvalue λMN−1 (spectral radius) of random triangulations on the lattice
size. The results of the Monte-Carlo simulations for random triangulations can be
found in Fig. 8, as well as the values of the algebraic connectivity and the spectral
radius for the different considered models of random graphs.

Using a power law ﬁt for the algebraic connectivity of random triangulations one

ﬁnds that

(cid:104)λ1(cid:105) ≈ (10.7± 0.2)(MN)−0.949±0.003

This compares well with the analytical result for the periodic maximal ordered trian-
gulation (11)

because the algebraic connectivity is determined by the edge and vertex connectivity
(compare the bounds (3)), which are themselves determined by the vertices with small
degree mainly located at the boundary. For the algebraic connectivity of the Erd¨os-
R´enyi random graph one ﬁnds a different behaviour: For MN (cid:47) 200 there is a power
law behaviour ∝ x−0.44, but for MN (cid:39) 200 there is a power law behaviour ≈ x−2.
The change in the power law exponent corresponds to the fact that for large number
of vertices MN and p → 6/MN some of the random graphs become disconnected as
described in Sec. 2.3 and have an algebraic connectivity λ1 = 0. So the fraction of
disconnected random graphs increases with MN which inﬂuences the averaging of
the algebraic connectivity. The algebraic connectivities of the Newman-Watts model
and the Barab´asi-Albert model converge to the ﬁnite values λ1,NW = 0.553± 0.003
and λ1,BA = 1.238± 0.001.

For the spectral radius of the random triangulation the power law ﬁt yields

(cid:104)λMN−1(cid:105) = (27.4± 0.5)− (27.6± 0.3)· (MN)−0.147±0.006,

which is much larger than the value 9 for the maximal ordered triangulation, since the
bounds (4) of the spectral radius are governed by the maximal degree of the vertices,
which is much larger for random triangulations (see Ref. [47]). For the Erd¨os-R´enyi
model one gets a limit of 21.1± 0.2 and power law exponent −0.259± 0.006, for the
Newman-Watts model the limit is 15.46± 0.09 with power law exponent −0.337±
0.007. For the Barab´asi-Albert model the spectral radius grows much more quickly,
because the preferential attachment and the resulting power law degree distribution
lead to nodes with much higher degrees than in random triangulations and the other
random graphs. Since in Eq. (4) the maximal vertex degree is a lower bound for the
spectral radius this implies a higher spectral radius for the Barab´asi-Albert model.

The parameters obtained by the ﬁts of the spectral radius and the algebraic con-

nectivity are summarised in Tab. 1.

Inverse participation ratio and localization In this section the inverse participation
ratio (IPR) (5) of the Laplacian spectrum of random triangulations is examined in
terms of the system size. In Fig. 9 the average IPR (cid:104)χ(cid:105), as well as the IPR of the alge-
braic connectivity (cid:104)χ1(cid:105) and the spectral radius (cid:104)χMN−1(cid:105) are displayed and compared
with the common random graph models.

For random triangulations the average IPR (cid:104)χ(cid:105) decreases with a power law

(cid:104)χ(cid:105) ≈ (0.671± 0.008)· (MN)−0.512±0.004 + (0.05334± 0.0005)

for increasing system size (similiar to the other considered random graph models), the
exponent −0.512±0.004 being smaller than the analyical calculated exponent −1 for
periodic maximal ordered triangulations. Since the data obtained for random lattice
triangulations does not allow for a power-law ﬁt without constant offset, one can con-
clude that for random triangulations there is a non-vanishing limit (0.05334±0.0005)
for inﬁnite system sizes, in contrast to Newman-Watts and Barab´asi-Albert random
graphs (compare Tab. 1, for Erd¨os-R´enyi the situation is ambiguous, both possible
ﬁts are done there). This implies that on average the localization of eigenvectors for
random triangulations is higher than for comparable random graphs.

different random graphs for 322 vertices (e).

The IPR (cid:104)χ1(cid:105) of the algebraic connectivity random lattice triangulations is ap-
proximatly equal to that of the maximal ordered triangulation and decreases with a
power law ∝ x−0.896±0.006, since the algebraic connectivity is determined by the ver-
tices with low degree (which are the vertices at the corner of the lattice), and the
degree is likely to be unchanged for the random triangulations. One can ﬁnd a simil-
iar decrease for Barab´asi-Albert , but not for Erd¨os-R´enyi or Newman-Watts random
graphs (which converge towards a ﬁnite value for increasing system size). The IPR
of the spectral radius converges to a value above 0.8, with a similiar functional de-
pendency as the other random graph models.

The probability distribution function of the IPRs for random triangulations is
comparable to the one of random graphs, there are differences only in the probability
of the largest IPRs, which correspond to the strongest localization.

a microcanonical ensemble and examine the Laplacian spectrum, the algebraic con-
nectivity λ1 and the spectral radius λMN−1 in terms of the energy for different system

sizes. For each lattice size we measure the energy in units of the average energy (cid:104)E(cid:105)rnd
of random triangulations on an equal sized lattice to make the results for different lat-
tice sizes comparable. We will use ε = E/Ernd to denote this rescaled energy.

Since in general the Pachner moves are not ergodic if restricting to the subset of
triangulations with energy E, we use the following algorithm for generating sample
triangulations with given energy E:
– Start with a random triangulation with arbitrary energy, generated as described in

Sec. 4.1.

– Perform Metropolis Monte Carlo steps [51] with the acceptance probability

AMetropolis(T1 → T2) := min(cid:18)1,

exp[−β E(T1)](cid:19)
exp[−β E(T2)]

(18)

and check after each step whether the obtained triangulation has the desired en-
ergy, then stop (the inverse temperature β can be tuned to ﬁnd the desired energy
more quickly). Note that the actual number of steps necessary to ﬁnd a suitable
triangulation depends on the given energy and cannot be predicted.

– If the desired energy was reached, take the triangulation for measuring the ob-
servables and perform 1000MN steps at β = 0 to randomise the triangulation and
avoid autocorrelations between successive measurements. Note that the autocor-
relation time is always below 10MN as explained in Sec. 4.1.

These steps are repeated until the desired number of sample triangulations with the
correct energy are found. In this paper we use 1000 samples for each energy and
system size.
For relative energies ε (cid:38) 2 one must use negative inverse temperatures in Eq. (18),
but there are many local minima where the simulation can get stucked in, which

make searching speciﬁc energies difﬁcult. In these situations we use the acceptance
probability

Aﬂat(T1 → T2) := min (1,exp (H[E(T1)]− H[E(T2)])) ,

for locating triangulations with the proper energy. This acceptance probability weights
every energy level E with the inverse exponential of the number H(E) the simulation
has visited the energy level before. Intuitively this means the longer the system stays
at a certain energy, the larger is the probability for leaving it, which avoids getting
stuck in local energy minima. Basically this procedure is the Wang-Landau algorithm
[74,73] that will be explained in detail in the following Sec. 4.3, using only a single
modiﬁcation factor.

Laplacian spectrum The microcanonical average of the Laplacian spectrum prob-
ability distribution function (PDF) for different values of the relative energy ε =
E/(cid:104)E(cid:105)rnd is plotted in Fig. 10. With increasing energy the eigenvalues λi become
smaller for relative index i/MN (cid:46) 0.75 and bigger for relative index i/MN (cid:38) 0.75, at
index i/MN ≈ 0.75 the eigenvalues do not change in a signiﬁcant way. As expected
the index-summed PDF looks similar to the ground state for ε (cid:38) 0 with a broad and
dominating peak around the eigenvalue magnitude of λ ≈ 8 and a smooth decrease for
λ < 6, and for ε ≈ 1 it is comparable with the spectrum of the random triangulation
with small and narrow peaks emerging. For relative energies ε > 2.0 narrow peaks
emerge in the eigenvalue range 2 < λ < 6, which can be seen as nearly horizontal
lines in the index-resolved PDF.

Algebraic connectivity and spectral radius Fig. 11 shows the algebraic connectivity
λ1, which is the second-smallest Laplacian eigenvalue, and the spectral radius λMN−1,
which is the biggest Laplacian eigenvalue, for microcanonical triangulations in terms
of the normalised energy for different lattice sizes. For energies around the average
random energy and smaller (ε = E/(cid:104)Ernd(cid:105) ≤ 1.5) both eigenvalues depend linearly
on the energy of the triangulation

where slope m(M,N) increases with growing system size M,N. The linear depen-
dence of the eigenvalues is more clearly for the spectral radius than for the algebraic
connectivity, and so the ﬁts have smaller errors.

The slope m(M,N) can be ﬁtted for the algebraic connectivity and the spectral

4.3 Canonical ensemble

The results for the microcanonical ensemble of triangulations as calculated in the pre-
vious section depend strongly on the choice of the energy functional. In this section
we present some results for canonical averages of observables in lattice triangula-
tions. These have in our opinion the advantage that the results should not change qual-
itatively if one changes the energy functional quantitatively. Especially the canonical
average inﬁnite temperature (β = 0, which is equivalent to the ensemble of random
triangulations) is independent of the choice of the energy functional, additionally the
limits for β → ±∞ should agree qualitatively.
One can use the standard Metropolis Monte-Carlo simulations [51] for calculating
canonical ensemble averages for triangulations by using the acceptance probability
(18), but there is a problem occurring in our setup if trying to access the regime of
negative temperatures, which can also be identiﬁed with negative coupling and pos-
itive temperatures [45,47]: For high energies there are triangulations that are local
minima in the energy landscape, i.e. all triangulations that are connected with these
triangulations have a higher energy, so for all possible steps the Metropolis accep-
tance probabilities (18) are small. For β < 0 small enough the algorithm cannot leave
these states in the available computation time, although of course there are other
states that contribute to the canonical expectation values. So the Metropolis results
are wrong and the system is not computationally ergodic anymore. Using a parallel
tempering approach [24] also fails since there is a quasi phase transition for small
negative β due to the large free energy barrier [47].

For negative temperatures there can also be a problem with increasing autocor-
relation time, as considered numerically in [47]. A similar problem was considered
analytically for lattice triangulations in Refs. [15,68], where Glauber dynamics was
used, which is basically the Metropolis algorithm with a slightly different choice of
the acceptance probabilities. Therein, the authors used an energy function that mea-
sures the sum of the edge lengths that qualitatively agrees with the energy function
(2). Instead of using the inverse temperature as control parameter, the coupling con-
stant of the energy was modiﬁed and allows to create ordered and disordered lattice

triangulations. It was shown in Ref. [15] that the mixing time, which is the time un-
til the Markov chain is near to statistical equilibrium, scales exponentially with the
system size for the analog of β < 0, and polynomial for the analog of a sufﬁciently
high β > β0 > 0, furthermore it was conjectured that the mixing time is polynomial
for all β > 0. For random triangulations (which is equal to β = 0) no result could
be obtained. Although these results are for the mixing and not for the autocorrelation
time, one can conjecture a strong relation between both.

A solution to both problems can be the usage of ﬂat histogram methods as en-
tropic sampling [50], or our method of choice, the Wang-Landau algorithm [74,73]:
Let g(E) be the density of states (DOS) of the system, which is the (normalised)
number of states with energy E. Instead of sampling according to the Boltzmann dis-
tribution P(T ) ∝ exp(−β E(T )), the Wang-Landau algorithm samples according to
the inverse DOS

PWL(T ) ∝

1

g (E(T )) ⇒ PWL(T1 → T2) := min(cid:18)1,

g(E(T1))

g(E(T2))(cid:19)

(20)

so each possible value of the energy will be sampled equally often (hence one speaks
of ﬂat-histogram sampling). Of course in most problems the DOS is a priori un-
known, such as for lattice triangulations. The Wang-Landau algorithm starts with an
initial guess for the DOS g0(E) and gradually improves the estimation gi(E) by in-
creasing the value of the estimation at energy levels that are visited in the simulation
by g(cid:48)i(E) = gi(E)· fi. The modiﬁcation factor fi is decreased throughout the simula-
tion whenever the incidence histogram H(E) (which counts the number of visits to
the energy level E since the last decrease of the modiﬁcation factor) is ﬂat. The esti-
mations then approach the actual DOS g(E) (see [74,73] for a detailed discussion of
the algorithm, [45] for the numerical calculations of g(E) for 2d lattice triangulations
and Fig. 12 for the DOS of 8× 8 lattice triangulations). For our simulations we use
an initial modiﬁcation factor of finitial = exp(1) and decrease it to fﬁnal = exp(10−8)
using fi+1 = 0.9· fi. The decrease of the modiﬁcation factor is chosen carefully com-
pared to fi+1 = 0.5· fi proposed in [74,73] to reduce possible statistical errors. The
incidence histogram H(E) is considered to be ﬂat if minH(E) ≥ 0.8· avgH(E). One
simulation for the largest considered system size, 10× 10 lattice triangulations, took
around 4 to 5 days of computing time on a single core, and a total of 8.1· 1010 at-
tempted steps, which correspond to 3.4· 108 attempted steps per ﬂippable edge in the
triangulation. We performed 10 independent Wang-Landau simulations for system
sizes smaller or equal than 8×8, and 5 independent simulations for the larger system
sizes. The relative statistical error of g(E) is below 0.02 in the former and below 0.03
in the latter case for all energies E.

After estimating g(E) of the density of states, canonical averages of an observable

O(T ) = O(E(T )) that only depends on the energy can be calculated using

(cid:104)O(cid:105)(β ) =

∑E O(E)g(E)exp(−β E)

∑E g(E)exp(−β E)

(21)

This means that the probability P(E) ∝ g(E)exp(−β E) to ﬁnd the system at energy
E at inverse temperature β weights the observables at the respective energy. In Fig. 12

P(E) (coloured lines) for the triangulation to have energy E in the canonical ensemble for different values
of the inverse temperature β .

the probability P(E) is plotted for different values of the inverse temperature β , as
well as the density of states g(E).

If the desired observable does not depend only on the energy (as the spectrum of
the triangulation), but on some other details of the state, one cannot apply Eq. (21)
and has the following two options: First one can extend the simulation and perform
a sampling of the extended density of states g(E, O) [48]. In many cases this is not
applicable, such as in lattice triangulations, since the resulting phase space is more
complicated and the sampling of the extended density of states needs too much com-
putation time. The second option is to calculate ﬁrst the density of states g(E) using
the standard Wang-Landau algorithm and then to use the obtained estimation of g(E)
to do a ﬂat-histogram sampling with weights (20) and to record the combined (nor-
malised) histogram H(E,A) which counts the occurrence of observable outcomes A
at certain energies E [36,78,79]. The canonical expectation value of the observable
can then be calculated using

(cid:104)O(cid:105)(β ) =

∑E ∑O O · H(E, O)· g(E)exp(−β E)

=

∑E g(E)exp(−β E)

∑E(cid:104)O(cid:105)mc · g(E)exp(−β E)

∑E g(E)exp(−β E)

(22)
which means that one weights the microcanonical expectation value with the Boltz-
mann factor.

For two-dimensional unimodular lattice triangulations the density of states can
only be calculated for all possible energies up to 11 × 11 triangulations using the
Wang-Landau algorithm, but it is possible to calculate the density of states for ener-
gies E ≤ Ec smaller than a cutoff Ec for up to 25×25 triangulations [45]. This density
of states with cutoff can only be used for calculating canonical expectation values for
β > βc, where βc is a cutoff in the inverse temperatures, which is negative for the
DOS calculated in [45].

code (a) left shows the index-resolved probability density function (PDF) in terms of the index of the
eigenvalue and the magnitude of the eigenvalues for inverse temperatures β = −0.1,−0.04,0,0.2. The
index-summed PDF (b) is also displayed for the different inverse temperatures.

One has to keep in mind that the regime of negative couplings (β < 0) is not
well deﬁned in the thermodynamic limit (inﬁnite system sizes) since the new speciﬁc
ground-state energy (which is the negative maximal energy of the positive-coupling
model) is not bounded from below [47]. So one can consider only ﬁnite system sizes
for β < 0.

Laplacian spectrum In Fig. 13 the results for the canonical averages of the Lapla-
cian spectrum of 8× 8-triangulations are displayed. The indexed-resolved spectrum
shows similar behaviour as for the different energies in the microcanonical ensem-
ble. For ﬁnite positive temperatures (β = 0.1) the spectrum approaches the Laplacian
spectrum of the ground state. For ﬁnite negative temperatures/couplings (β = −0.04)
the spectrum gets more irregular, which can be seen in the rich peak structure of the
summed probability density functions. This means that the peaked eigenvalues oc-
cur very often in the triangulations that contribute to the ensemble average at these
temperature with height weight.

Algebraic connectivity and spectral radius The results for the canonical expectation
values of algebraic connectivity λ1 and the spectral radius λMN−1 are displayed in
Fig. 14 for lattice size 8× 8.
Both eigenvalues show the same step-like behaviour as the energy, the clustering
coefﬁcient and the shortest path length at a negative quasi-critical temperature [47].
The algebraic connectivity is almost independent of the lattice size for β → −∞ and
decreases for larger lattices in the limit β → ∞, while the spectral radius is approx-
imately independent of the lattice size in the limit β → ∞ and increases for larger
lattices in the limit β → −∞. The latter behaviour can be understood completely by
considering the bounds (4) of the spectral radius. For β → ∞ the triangulation with

verse temperature β for different lattice sizes, calculated using the Wang-Landau algorithm. The algebraic

the biggest weight are the triangulations near the ground state, where most vertex
degrees are 6 independently of the size, which bounds the spectral radius between 6
and 12. For β → −∞ the ensemble average is dominated by the triangulation with
high energy, which are the triangulations where one edge is connected with almost
all possible edges. Since the degree of this maximal connected vertex, which is the
lower bound for the spectral radius, is increasing with the size of the lattice, also the
spectral radius must increase.

For a possible application of the canonical ensemble of lattice triangulations one
can consider the relation of the algebraic connectivity and the spectral radius with the
synchronization time and the return probability [4,58]. Here the canonical ensem-
ble with the inverse temperature as control parameter can be used for continuously
ﬁne-tuning these quantities on lattice triangulation networks. For negative inverse
temperatures (small-world behaviour of the triangulation graph ensemble) with high
algebraic connectivity and spectral radius one ﬁnds a short synchronization time and
a fast decrease of the return probability, which implies a fast delocalization. For grow-
ing inverse temperatures (approaching the large-world behaviour of the triangulation
graph ensemble) the synchronization time decreases and the delocalization is slower
than in the previous region.

Inverse participation ratio In Fig. 15 the average inverse participation ratio (IPR) and
the IPRs of the algebraic connectivity and the spectral radius are plotted in terms of
the inverse temperatures. As expected, all considered IPRs and therewith the localiza-
tion increases for increasing disorder in the triangulations. Near the quasi-critical in-
verse temperature βqc one observes that the IPRs scale with the logarithm log|β −βqc|
of the reduced inverse temperature.

5 Conclusions

In this paper we examined the spectral properties of the graph interpretation of two-
dimensional unimodular lattice triangulations. These triangulations show a transition
from ordered large-world to disordered small-world behaviour.

For the random triangulations we calculated the spectrum of the adjacency and
the Laplacian matrix numerically and compared them with common random graph
models. The algebraic connectivity, which is the smallest non-vanishing eigenvalue
of the Laplacian matrix, vanished with a power law in terms of the system size,
which is similar to the Erd¨os-R´enyi graph, but different to the Newman-Watts and
Barab´asi-Albert random graph, which tend to a ﬁxed value for increasing lattice size.
Calculating the average inverse participation ratio we showed that random lattice tri-
angulations on average exhibit stronger localization than comparable random graphs.
We introduced an energy function that corresponds to the order and the disorder
of the lattice triangulation to calculate the dependence of the spectral observables on
the order of the triangulation in the microcanonical and the canonical ensemble.

For the microcanonical ensemble we ﬁnd for small energies a linear dependence
of the algebraic connectivity and the spectral radius on the energy of the triangu-
lations. In the case of the spectral radius the linear dependence can be understood
analytically using the ground state values, that can be calculated analytically, and
perturbation theory. For the algebraic connectivity perturbation theory fails because
the ﬁxed boundary conditions have stronger inﬂuence than the perturbation of the
ﬂip.

In the canonical ensemble, that was numerically calculated with the Wang-Landau
algorithm, we ﬁnd a crossover between ordered, large-world behaviour with a system-
size independent spectral radius and a disordered, small-world behaviour with a system-
size independent algebraic connectivity and stronger localization than in the ordered

phase. This crossover behaviour can also be found in other observables as the mean
energy, the clustering coefﬁcient and the average shortest path length [47].

Our results can be applied to planar real-world graphs where the actual coordi-
nates of the vertices or the distance between vertices becomes important or must be
optimised, e.g. in the power grid or in transport problems. Using also the inserting
and removing Pachner moves that lead to non-full triangulations the properties of a
grand-canonical ensemble of triangulations can be studied in the future. In order to
take into account arbitrary embedded planar networks, one can also examine trian-
gulations of random point sets instead of a square lattice. It can also be promising to
study the localization in greater detail to understand better the underlying mechanism,
