Abstract

We present the outline and ﬁrst results of a project using the synergies of the long term blazar radio-
millimetre monitoring program f-gamma, the continued scanning of the millimetre-submillimetre
sky by the Planck satellite, together with several dedicated observing programs at the Eﬀelsberg
100m telescope, to obtain a data sample unprecedented in both time resolution and frequency span.

Introduction

Highly time resolved multifrequency observations of blazars are the key to our understanding of the
extreme physics of supermassive black holes and their jets, called active galactic nuclei (AGN). A
particular role play here the non-thermal fringes of the electromagnetic spectrum, the radio and γ-ray
regime, where strongly variable emission from relativistic jets directed towards the observer dominates
the AGN spectrum. Since the launch of the Fermi -GST in June 2008, the correlation of the emission of
these regimes has been the subject of intensive research, most prominently with the Fermi -GST related
f-gamma program [1, 2]. Less investigated is for such highly variable sources the submillimetre
regime, marking the transition to the thermal emission of AGN. Here, the Planck satellite, built to
investigate the structure of the cosmic microwave background [3, 4], provides a valuable data set, which
partly overlaps the wavebands covered by the f-gamma program, but extends the range to 857 GHz
(350 µm). This can give insight on possible submillimetre variability and its relation to classical radio
variability, and set the path for future observations and monitoring involving instruments like ALMA,
covering the same frequency range as Planck with signiﬁcantly higher sensitivity and resolution.

2 Targets and observations

2.1 F-GAMMA observations
The Fermi -GST related monitoring program of gamma-ray blazars (f-gamma) closely coordinated
Eﬀelsberg 100m observations with the more general ﬂux monitoring at the IRAM 30m telescope
between 2008 and 2014. Eﬀelsberg measurements were conducted with the secondary focus heterodyne

receivers at 2.64, 4.85, 8.35, 10.45, 14.60, 23.05, 32.00 and 43.00 GHz, performed quasi-simultaneously
with cross-scans, slewing over the source position in azimuth and elevation direction with an adaptive
number of sub-scans [1, 2, 5]. The IRAM 30m observations were carried out with calibrated cross-
scans using the EMIR bands at 86.2 and 142.3 GHz in horizontal and vertical polarization. The
opacity corrected intensities were converted into the standard temperature scale and ﬁnally corrected
for pointing oﬀsets and systematic gain-elevation eﬀects. The conversion to standard ﬂux densities was
done using frequently observed primary (Mars, Uranus) and secondary (W3(OH), K3-50A, NGC 7027)
calibrators. The f-gamma target sample is based on a collection of about 90 Fermi -bright blazars, of
which 60 have been regularly monitored with a cadence of about 1 month. Subsamples of these have
been scientiﬁcally analysed in Refs. [2, 5], where also a full description of the sample can be found.

2.2 Complete sample of ﬂat spectrum blazars and other targets

To allow solid statistical analysis of combined Planck-Eﬀelsberg data, we have deﬁned a complete
sample of ﬂat spectrum blazars derived from the crates catalog [6], applying the spectral index
cuts α<4.8GHz > −0.3 and α<8.4GHz < 0.1 (convention: Fν ∝ ν−α), a ﬂux limit F8.4GHz > 1.0 Jy, and
declination δ > −10◦. These criteria focus on sources with ﬂat cm-spectra, but exclude GPS objects.
To ensure observability by Planck, we further required F≥143GHz > 700 mJy, for which we used the
Planck ercsc at 143 and 217 GHz [7]. The total sample of 32 sources is listed in Table 1. It has an
overlap of 9 sources with the core f-gamma sample, and 26 sources with the Mets¨ahovi sample of
northern radio sources otherwise used for blazar research with Planck [8]. Five sources are located
in the so-called Planck deep ﬁeld around the ecliptic north-pole, which are much more frequently hit
by Planck than other sources of the sky [3, 4]. Because of the importance of sources in this region
for analysis of Planck measured ﬂux variations on short time scales (see below), we have observed
two more deep ﬁeld blazars, S4 1749+70 and S4 1849+67, which will be individually analysed but not
included in statistical analysis. All sources in this target list were observed with the Eﬀelsberg 100m
telescope between April 2011 and February 2012 with a cadence of about one month and a two week
oﬀset from f-gamma observations. Observations of individual sources have been restricted to times
maximally 2 months from a Planck scan, thus following Planck during its 4th and 5th sky survey.
Most observations were using ﬁve Eﬀelsberg receivers at 4.85, 8.35, 14.60, 23.05, and 32.00 GHz, but
some were performed using all the receivers used by the f-gamma program.

analysis and discussion. Fluxes at 8.4 GHz and 143 GHz, taken from crates and Planck ercsc, respectively,
are given in Jy, z denotes the source redshift.

Figure 1: f-gamma light curves from 8.35 to 142.3 GHz for the bright blazar 3C84 between Aug 2009 and Dec 2013,
with ﬂuxes of the Planck LFI 30, 44, and 70 GHz radiometers, HFI 100 GHz PSBs and HFI 143 GHz SWBs, noted at
their central bandpass frequencies [3, 4, and references therein]. Planck ﬂuxes are derived from TOI mapping as weighted
averages over full scans and all detectors at one frequency combined, errors express the rms scattering of the single PID
ﬂuxes during each scan (see text and Ref. [12]).

2.3 Time-resolved Planck ﬂuxes

In most Planck related analysis of CMB foregrounds, point sources are extracted from time-restricted
sky maps [8, 9, 10, and subsequent work]. Such extraction methods are well established and validated,
but restricted to pre-deﬁned time cuts of the available maps, and potentially subject to artifacts in
the sources spectra at the edges of survey cuts [11]. To overcome this restriction, Planck ﬂuxes used
here are directly extracted from the Planck time ordered information (TOI), utilising tools developed
for blind variability searches in Planck data [12] based on the beam-deconvolution code ArtDeco [13].
These tools detect ﬂux variations in a given sky position and associate them with bright variable
sources within the beam. For every pointing ID (PID) and each detector, a source ﬂux is estimated by
de-convolving with the detector beam to the position of the source. While sweeping over the source,
Planck produces a “survey scan” proﬁle with roughly one hour time resolution. Such “single PID ﬂux
deviation estimates” suﬀer stongly from instrument noise, systematics due to our incomplete knowledge
of scanning beam proﬁles, precise pointing, and gain variations, plus technical limitations of the method
applied, and thus show a large scattering between individual PIDs. To obtain reasonable ﬂux estimates,
they are therfore combined to single-survey ﬂuxes, which represent the average deviations from the
mean ﬂux over several hours to one day, with errors conservatively taken as the standard deviation
of individual PID ﬂuxes over the survey scan. Total ﬂuxes are determined by adding the measured
average deviation to the source ﬂux listed in the Second Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources [14],
which contains ﬂuxes of point sources averaged over the entire mission. Figure 1 shows single survey
ﬂuxes for the bight blazar 3C84 together with f-gamma monitoring data. More options are given for
blazars in the Planck deep ﬁeld, where single PID results can be combined according to signal-to-noise
requirements to long time lines at selected frequencies.

3 Project goals

3.1 Radio to submillimetre monitoring of blazars on long and short time scales

Planck time resolved ﬂuxes combined with cm-mm data can add to our knowledge on blazar vari-
ability in several ways: First, by determining quasi-simultaneous spectra extending over 2.5 orders of
magnitude in frequency, where Planck reﬁnes and extends the frequency coverage, as demonstrated in
Refs. [8, 10, 11]. Second, for sources located in the Planck deep ﬁeld it allows, albeit in irregular pat-
ters, monitoring at single frequencies on sub-day-scale resolution. A tentative detection of a ﬂare with
one week time scale in the blazar S5 1803+78 at 30 GHz (starting April 2, 2012), which was entirely
missed by the f-gamma monitoring, might be a ﬁrst result in this direction, but still requires checks
for instrumental systematics. The potential of Planck for such investigation is given in particular for
frequencies with large beamwidths (30 and 44 GHz) or covering several detector rows in the Planck
focal plane (70, 143, 217 GHz). A particular case is the Planck 44 GHz channel, which has detectors
at both ends of the focal plane and thus allows conclusions on one-week scale variability for essentially
all sources in the sky (see Refs. [11, 15] for details).

3.2 External validation of Planck variability analysis and project time line

Another important role of this project is the external validation of the Planck blind variability detec-
tion method [12], as it allows to check the reliability of detected ﬂux variations on PID time scales
and the discrimination from instrumental eﬀects by comparing TOI-derived ﬂuxes with quasi simulta-
neous measuremets with external telescopes. First comparisons made for the nine f-gamma sources
in our complete sample have shown an excellent agreement between HFI 143 GHz SWB ﬂuxes and
IRAM 30m 143 GHz, while the comparison of LFI 30 GHz with Eﬀelsberg 32 GHz shows systematically
higher Planck ﬂuxes, which may be explained by the oﬀset in center frequencies, the very diﬀerent
beam sizes of Planck and Eﬀelsberg, or methodological systematics. Further investigations are un-
derway, and we expect that both the blind search for variability and the time resolved ﬂux extraction
will be ﬁnished well before the ﬁnal release of Planck results.
