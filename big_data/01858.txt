We investigate Non-Linear Plane-Wave solutions of the classical Minkowskian Yang-Mills (YM) equations of
motion. By imposing a suitable ansatz which solves Gauss’ law for the SU (3) theory, we derive solutions which
consist of Jacobi elliptic functions depending on an enumerable set of elliptic modulus values. The solutions
represent periodic anharmonic plane waves which possess arbitrary non-zero mass and are exact extrema of the
non-linear YM action. Among them, a unique harmonic plane wave with a non-trivial pattern in phase, spin and
color is identiﬁed. Similar solutions are present in the SU (4) case while are absent from the SU (2) theory.

INTRODUCTION

Classical solutions of ﬁeld theories remain of central in-
terest in the understanding of the structure and dynamics of
the Standard Model particle interactions. Regarding the pure
Yang-Mills (YM) theory, major attention has been drawn on
the extrema of the Euclidean action –the instantons– whose
structure and properties are determined by topology (for a Re-
view see [1]). A lot of work has been produced on the rel-
evance of the instanton conﬁgurations to the conﬁning prop-
erties of the YM quantum vacuum as well as the quark dy-
namics coupled to the gauge bosons. On the other hand, in
the Minkowskian 3+1-D spacetime, solitary waves, solitons or
travelling localized lumps with a ﬁnite energy are forbidden in
the SU (N ) gauge theory as Coleman has shown generally [2]
that ﬁnite-energy non-singular gauge ﬁeld conﬁgurations that
do not radiate out to spatial inﬁnity are not allowed to exist.
Minkowskian Non-Linear Plane Waves (NLPW) have been
shown to exist for the SU (2) theory [3] and have the form
of the Jacobian Elliptic function cn(ω t − ~k · ~x; 1/2) with
ﬁxed elliptic parameter 1/2 and relativistic dispersion rela-
tion ω2 = ~k2 + m2 for an arbitrary mass parameter m. The
self-interaction term is reﬂected in the anharmonic form of
the cn-wave while scale invariance leaves free the value of
mass m. Other solutions of the SU (2) Minkowskian equa-
tions of motion (EoM) are generated from the massless scalar
φ4 theory extrema via the Corrigan-Fairlie-’t Hooft-Wilczek
ansatz [4],[5] or generalized forms [6].

Regarding the SU (3) theory, a restrictive form of massless
plane waves were initially shown to exist by Coleman [7], and
in a more general form in [8], technically dropping out the
interaction. A class of massive plane-wave solutions of the
non-abelian theory can be constructed from classical solutions
of the massless φ4 theory [9]. These are anharmonic waves
of the cn(ω t − ~k · ~x; 1/2) type and are essentially the waves
contructed via the ’multiple copies trick’ [10]. Such solutions
have also been shown to become relevant to the properties of
the quantum theory in the strong coupling limit [9].

It is the purpose of this work to investigate if more gen-
eral NLPW solutions exist for the SU (3) gauge theory EoM.
For this reason we present in Section 2 the detailed form
of the EoM for the general SU (N ) NLPW ansatz based on
Lorentz symmetry and the scale invariance of the theory.
In Section 3 we review the so-called ’multiple copies trick’

[10] which determines SU (N ) solutions proportional to the
cn(ω t − ~k · ~x; 1/2) ﬁeld with appropriate Non-Abelian con-
stant factors and derive in particular the form of the constants
for the SU (3) theory. In Section 4 we propose a more general
ansatz that solves the Gauss law constraint equations for the
SU (3) gauge theory. We arrive to a set of coupled cubic equa-
tions for complex ﬁelds which correspond to planar point par-
ticle dynamics bounded by the r4 potential. The gauge ﬁeld
color and polarization indices of the solution are mixed in a
non-trivial scheme. The general solution is ﬁxed by the angu-
lar momentum L of the particle in the sense that the elliptic
parameter k2 of the Jacobian Elliptic functions is connected
to L via a non-linear equation. It is interesting that for the
highest value of L allowed, a harmonic massive plane wave is
shown to exist solving the SU (3) EoM even in the presence of
the interaction terms. In Section 5 we show that plane waves
other than the ones in [3] do not exist for the SU (2) theory.
We ﬁnally outline the relevant ansatz for SU (4) and the em-
bedding of the SU (3) solutions in it. The possible utility of
such solutions is commented in the ﬁnal section.

The corresponding classical EoM for the gauge ﬁeld are 1:

The ν = 0 set of the above equations constitute the Gauss law
constraint obeyed by the non-dynamical ﬁelds Aa

ν = 1, 2, 3 eqs provide the evolution of the dynamical spatial
components. We introduce generic plane wave solutions, i.e.
ﬁelds depending explicitly on the plane wave phase

ξ = ω t − ~k · ~x

(6)

with the momentum four-vector kµ = (ω, ~k) satisfying the
dispersion relation ω2 = ~k2 + m2 for an arbitrary mass pa-
rameter m. In the physical system of units, the gauge ﬁeld
also has the dimension of mass so we scale the ﬁelds as fol-
lows, eliminating at the same time completely the coupling g
from the classical EoM:

III. THE MULTIPLE COPIES TECHNIQUE

Now we make use of Lorentz covariance of eq. (9) by boosting
the vector ﬁelds Aa
µ on the proper time frame, where kµ →
(m,~0) and ξ → mt, via a Lorentz transformation Λ(~β) with
boost parameters

A standard trick which solves the Gauss law constraint (for
any SU (N )) is the so-called multiple copies technique [10].
This is the selection of copies of a color-independent ﬁeld
(Φx, Φy, Φz) as

IV. SU(3)

We present here a more general way to solve the Gauss law
constraint (eq. 16) for the SU (3) theory. The idea is to arrange
the matrix-vector ~A in such a way that it becomes orthogonal
to the matrix-vector multiplication with itself. This can be
achieved by “staggering” the color ﬁelds of the fundamental
3×3 matrix along the three orthogonal vectors of the R3 basis
(ˆe1, ˆe2, ˆe3) in the following way:
~A =


3(cid:16)D1ˆe1 + D2ˆe2 + D3ˆe3(cid:17)I3

(27)
with D1, D2, D3 real functions and Ψ1, Ψ2, Ψ3 complex func-
tions of ξ. Essentially, each complex SU (3) root pair –
which corresponds to a doublet of non-diagonal color ﬁelds–
is aligned along one of the three spatial directions. The ex-
plicit connection with the octet ﬁelds is given below (with all
other components zero):

A direct check of the Gauss law is straightforward, since the
trace piece (second term in (27)) drops out of the commutator.
By construction each column (row) of the ﬁrst term in (27)) is
orthogonal to any other column (row) and thus the Gauss law
is written:

Implementation of the Gauss law requires:

(30)

(31)

with the classes of solutions distinguished from now on by the
L 6= 0 and L = 0 cases.
The dynamical EoM (24 in total) are derived according
to (27). We separate them in to three different groups.
Group 1:

¨Ψ1 + Ψ1h|Ψ2|2 + |Ψ3|2 + D2
¨Ψ2 + Ψ2h|Ψ1|2 + |Ψ3|2 + D2

D2Ψ1Ψ2 = 0 , D2Ψ2Ψ3 = 0
D3Ψ1Ψ3 = 0 , D3Ψ2Ψ3 = 0

A. L 6= 0 solutions

(32)

(33)

(34)

Admitting L 6= 0 requires Ψ1 6= 0, Ψ2 6= 0 and Ψ3 6= 0.
From the ’Group 3’ equations we are lead to

D1 = D2 = D3 = 0 ,

(35)

and the coupled system of equations:

¨Ψ1 + Ψ1h|Ψ2|2 + |Ψ3|2i = 0
¨Ψ2 + Ψ2h|Ψ1|2 + |Ψ3|2i = 0
¨Ψ3 + Ψ3h|Ψ1|2 + |Ψ2|2i = 0

(36)

The above system has the interpretation of three coupled pla-
nar point dynamics on the Ψ1, Ψ2 and Ψ3 planes respectively
(which are the 1 − 2, 4 − 5 and 6 − 7 planes in the adjoint
representation). One may use equivalently a polar coordinate
description

Ψ1 = r1eiθ1 , Ψ2 = r2eiθ2 , Ψ3 = r3eiθ3

(37)

with (ri, θi) functions of the phase ξ. The dynamics on each
plane is invariant under independent global U (1) rotations

Ψ1 → Ψ1eiω1 , Ψ2 → Ψ2eiω2 , Ψ3 → Ψ3eiω3 ,

(38)

or equivalently under independent SO(2) rotations on the
(ri, θi) planes. From this we identify L1, L2, L3 in eq. (29)
as the conserved angular momenta of the three coupled rotat-
ing particles,

Imposing the Gauss law L1 = L2 = L3, relates the complex
functions Ψ1, Ψ2, Ψ3 via linear transformations. These are
well known, e.g.

Ψ2 = aΨ1 + bΨ∗

1 , aa∗ − bb∗ = 1

(40)

where a, b arbitrary complex constants. Equivalently, in the
cartesian form they act as SL(2, R) transformations 3, e.g.

Up to constant angles, this also leads to θ1 = θ2 = θ3 = θ

We scaled the constant (8E/3)1/4 = 1 in (45) by absorbing it
from now on in the mass parameter m. Eq. (46) is solved by
a Weierstrass elliptic function, P, which is a doubly periodic
function on the complex plane. We look for real, positive,
bounded solutions to describe periodic closed orbits on the
(r, θ) plane and the suitable solution is expressed in terms of
the Jacobi elliptic functions sn(ξ; k2), cn(ξ; k2), dn(ξ; k2) of
elliptic modulus k (or elliptic parameter k2),

The parameter α = √e3 − e1 and e1, e2, e3 are the three real
roots of 3u − 4u3 − λ = 0. Three real roots exist only for
0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 and are conveniently expressed via an angle φ
which satisﬁes λ = cosφ,

The solution (47) oscillates between e2 and e3 with a period

the ﬁrst kind of elliptic modulus k). The angular ﬁeld θ is

am(x; k2) is the Jacobi amplitude function, which satisﬁes
sin(am(x; k2)) = sn(x; k2). A periodic solution for the
gauge ﬁelds is equivalent to a closed orbit for the rotor (43)
on the (r, θ) plane. Thus a “quantization” condition on the
parameter λ of the solution is enforced from the periodicity of
θ for integers N, N ′ such that:

takes the value N ′/N , i.e. on the set of rationals. From known
properties and a Taylor analysis of Q(φ) for φ near π/2 we
deduce that Q(φ) increases monotonically in the (1/√6, 1/2)
interval (see Fig. 1). Effectively, Eq.(52) becomes a “quan-
tization” condition on the angular momentum L of the ro-
tor since λ = 4L2. Solutions of (52) are obtained easily
numerically by selecting pairs of integers (N ′, N ) such that
1/√6 < N ′/N < 1/2. The lowest pairs of integers satisfy-
ing Eq.(52) are shown in Table I. For a given (large) N , one
expects based on the density of primes that the number of so-
lutions are roughly ∼ 0.1N/ log N .
The elliptic modulus k as determined from eq. (47) takes an
enumerable, inﬁnite set of values in the interval 0 ≤ k2 ≤
1/2. A particularly interesting solution is represented by
the circular orbit, λ = 1, (φ = 0), which has the maximal
angular momentum, L = 1/2. At this point k = 0 and
the Jacobi elliptic functions become harmonic (sn(ξ; 0) =
sin ξ, cn(ξ; 0) = cos ξ, dn(ξ; 0) = 1). Since r = 1/√2 and
θ = ξ, a massive, harmonic wave solution of the interacting
YM EoM is given on the proper frame by 4

The other limiting solution is obtained for φ = π/2, (λ =

boost, eqs (10-11). The R3 basis (ˆe1, ˆe2, ˆe3) is boosted to the

monic plane wave solution is recovered for r = 1/√2 and
θ = ωt−~k·~x. Note that the solution (57) satisﬁes the Lorentz
gauge condition ∂µAµa = 0 on any frame and this is a direct
consequence of the ansatz (27) chosen on the proper frame.
It may also be called ’diagonal’ in the sense that the complex
SU (3) algebra roots are aligned with the three gluon polariza-
tion states. Global SU (3) transformations on the solution (57)
are allowed since they do not spoil the Lorentz gauge condi-

B. L = 0 solutions

Solutions satisfying L = 0 are also possible. In that case the
angles θ1, θ2, θ3 are necessarily constants.

• The case Ψ1 = Ψ2 = Ψ3 = 0 does not lead to interest-
ing (periodic) solutions.

• The case Ψ1 6= 0, Ψ2 = Ψ3 = 0, from the ’Group 2’
equations, in order to avoid unbounded solutions for D2
and D3 leads also to D1 = D2 = D3 = 0, and ﬁnally
forbids any bounded solution.

• The case Ψ1 6= 0, Ψ2 6= 0, Ψ3 = 0, from the ’Group 3’
equations, leads to D1 = D2 = 0. This allows the
following set of coupled equations for the remaining
ﬁelds:

thus generate additional color ﬁelds in the Cartan subalgebra

For the case of SU (4) gauge theory we propose the following
ansatz for the gauge potential which similar to eq. (27) has by
construction orthogonal rows (columns) to each other:

cases are

and the similar permutations.

From the above analysis we conclude that the L = 0 solu-
tions are less interesting and are always of the cn(ξ; 1/2) -type
which solves also the SU (2) theory.

V. OTHER GAUGE GROUPS

A. SU(2)

For SU (2) we solve the Gauss’ law via the following ansatz:

~A =

1

2(cid:18)

Dˆe3

Ψ1ˆe1 + Ψ∗

2ˆe2

Ψ∗

1ˆe1 + Ψ2ˆe2
−Dˆe3

(cid:19)

(63)

with D a real function and Ψ1, Ψ2 complex functions of ξ.
The Gauss law is written

GaT a = ~A ·

˙~A −

˙~A · ~A =

where we introduced

L2 − L1(cid:19) (64)

Lj =

(Ψj ˙Ψ∗

j − Ψ∗

j

˙Ψj) , j = 1, 2.

(65)

Implementation of the Gauss law requires L1 = L2 = L. The
EoM for the ansatz (64) are:

¨Ψ1 + Ψ1D2 +

¨Ψ2 + Ψ2D2 +

Ψ∗

¨D + Dh|Ψ1|2 + |Ψ2|2i = 0
2i = 0
2i = 0

1hΨ1Ψ2 − Ψ∗

1
2

2

1Ψ∗

1Ψ∗

Ψ∗

(66)

The above equations do not admit harmonic plane-wave solu-
tions. Assuming the ansatz Ψ1 = c1eiω1ξ, Ψ2 = c2eiω2ξ with
constants c1, c2, ω1, ω2 and enforcing the Gauss’ law L1 = L2
it is shown easily that such solutions are not allowed. The only
integrable case of (66) appears for Ψ1 = iΨ2 = D which is
non-other than the original solution in [3].

(67)

The Gauss law for the above ansatz is written

˙~A · ~A = −2i diag(cid:16)L1 + L2 + L3,
GaT a = ~A ·
−L1 + L5 + L6,−L2 + L4 − L6,−L3 + L4 − L5(cid:17) (68)

where we introduced

Lj =

i
2

(Ψj ˙Ψ∗

j − Ψ∗

j

˙Ψj) , j = 1, 2, ..., 6.

(69)

Implementation of the Gauss law requires:

L1 + L2 + L3 = 0, −L1 + L5 + L6 = 0
−L2 + L4 − L6 = 0, −L3 + L4 − L5 = 0

(70)

The EoM contain cubic terms of the ﬁelds Ψi and a general
solution goes beyond the scope of this work. Here, we sim-
ply note that SU (3) solutions can be readily immersed into
SU (4) in four different ways:

Ψ1 = Ψ2 = Ψ3 = 0 , Ψ1 = Ψ5 = Ψ6 = 0
Ψ2 = Ψ4 = Ψ6 = 0 , Ψ3 = Ψ4 = Ψ5 = 0

(71)

For each of the choises, the remaining three ﬁelds are iden-
tiﬁed with the SU (3) solution, Eq.(57). Thus, plane waves,
and particularly harmonic, can also propagate in the SU (4)
theory, limited –at least– in the SU (3) subspaces.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

We have presented plane wave solutions for the SU (3)
Yang-Mills EoM in 3 + 1 dimensions. The solutions represent
massive non-linear plane waves, for arbitrary values of the
mass parameter –reﬂecting the scale invariance of the action–
and obeying the relativistic dispersion relation. The solution is
designed by alignining the non-diagonal color ﬁelds with the
polarization states of the massive vector boson. Via a global
SU (3) transformation all the octet ﬁelds participate in the so-
lution. The functional form is described by the dynamics of
a planar particle bounded with the r4 potential. The periodic
particle orbits on the plane are characterized from the value of
the angular momentum L which is bounded (in scaled units)
between zero and 1/2. The value of angular momentum is
related to the elliptic modulus k of the Jacobi elliptic func-
tions which describe the solution. Each rational number in the
(1/√6, 1/2) interval gives a solution, and at the edge of the
interval, with L = 1/2, a harmonic massive plane-wave solu-
tion of the interacting YM theory is recovered. Compared to

the SU (2) theory which possesses only the k2 = 1/2 plane
wave, the SU (3) theory presents a far more rich spectrum of
solutions with k2 obtaining an inﬁnite, enumerable set of val-
ues covering densely the interval 0 ≤ k2 ≤ 1/2.

The coupling to fermions is straightforward for static quark
matter in the Cartan (T 3, T 8) subalgebra. The Gauss law,
Eq. (29), admits quark densities on the r.h.s if angular mo-
menta values L1 6= L2 6= L3 are used.

Plane wave solutions, and in particular the harmonic ones,
may be of use in quantization schemes or particular perturba-
tive treatments of the quantum theory since they incorporate

8

automatically a gluon mass. The impact of such conﬁgura-
tions to the properties of the quantum theory is worthwhile to
assess. In addition, classical Minkowskian solutions may also
be useful in the study of gluon radiation, or the thermodynam-
ical properties near the phase transition where semiclassical
conﬁgurations become relevant.

Finally, we note that higher rank gauge groups admit sim-
ilar treatment. For the SU (4) theory, the Gauss law can be
solved following the same strategy. In the SU (3) subgroups
the plane wave solutions remain valid, while the issue of exis-
tence of more generic SU (4) solutions is left for future inves-
tigations.
