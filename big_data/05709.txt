For isotropic ﬂuids, classical nucleation theory predicts the nucleation rate, barrier height and
critical droplet size by accounting for the competition between a bulk free energy and a surface
interfacial tension. The situation for anisotropic ﬂuids is less understood. Here, we numerically
investigate nucleation phenomena in nematogenic ﬂuids, using a mesoscopic framework based on
a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau-de Gennes description of isotropic and nematic phases. We
compare the nucleation of uniaxial nematic droplets in isotropic background near and above the
supercooling spinodal line with the nucleation of isotropic droplets in uniaxial nematic medium
near and below the superheating spinodal line in a quasi two-dimensional geometry. The ratio
between the anisotropic and isotropic elastic distortion κ is found to play a key role in determining
the geometric structure of the droplets. We ﬁnd that nematic droplets have an elliptical morphology
with a homogeneous director orientation for κ ≶ 0, while the shapes of these droplets are circular
for κ = 0. However for κ (cid:29) 0, an elliptical droplet with an integer topological charge accompanied
by a biaxial ring at the outer core of the droplet is obtained.
In contrast to the growth of the
nematic, isotropic bubbles that grow and coalesce in a superheated nematic medium are seen at early
stages. We obtain a growth law of the form L ∼ (at2 + bt + c)0.5 for both pathways, although the
nucleation of isotropic droplets follows an unusual two-stage nucleation and growth mechanism. The
temporal distribution of successive nucleation events signals the relevance of long ranged elasticity
mediated interactions in the nematic. We critically discuss the consequences of our results for
classical nucleation theory extended to anisotropic situations.

INTRODUCTION

A ﬂuid that exhibits a ﬁrst order phase transition
can transit from the unstable state to the stable phase
through spinodal coarsening, where domains of the sta-
ble phase spontaneously emerge and combine to mini-
mize the surface energy. However, transformations from
a metastable state occur via a nucleation and growth pro-
cess, where the metastable state hosts droplets of stable
phase that then coalesce. A classic example is that of
supercooled water freezing into ice via nucleation and
growth when driven by an external force, as noted by
Fahrenheit almost three centuries ago [1]. Nucleation
kinetics in solid solution proceeds via Ostwald ripening
[2], while metallic alloys and bulk metallic glasses con-
ventionally display dendritic growth due to anisotropic
surface eﬀects [3].

A set of fundamental problems in surface and interface
science concern the morphology of the nucleated phase,
its growth rate, the ﬁrst passage time as well as kinetic
routes to equilibrium. Questions of droplet morphology
are especially pertinent in studies of nematogenic ﬂuids
where such morphology is a key factor in determining the
nucleation rate [4, 5]. The microstructure of the nucleus
is decided by a nontrivial coupling amongst competing
energies: (i) the anisotropy associated with the deforma-
tion of the tensorial order in the bulk, (ii) an anisotropic
interfacial tension associated with the anchoring condi-

tion at the interface and (iii) external forcing (e.g. ther-
mal ﬂuctuations in equilibrium). Thus, one expects that
the droplet shape will not be spherical. In addition, com-
plex growth laws are expected and the nucleation rate
may itself lack a precise deﬁnition [6].

In recent years, liquid crystalline phases have found a
number of applications in nanoscience [7]. Droplet shapes
play a crucial role in ink-jet technology [8], switching
and bistable devices [9], in photovoltaics as well as in
bio-sensor applications, e.g. nucleation in living liquid
crystals [10]. Ref. [11] provides a concise introduction to
recent developments in nematic nanodroplets in experi-
ments, simulations and in industrial applications. Early
experiments on nucleation and growth in anisotropic sys-
tems by Bernal and Fankuchen, found evidence for as-
pherical spindle-shaped nematic droplets (called “tac-
toids”) in a metastable isotropic background [12]. Her-
ring, Chandrasekhar and Virga obtained nonspherical
nuclei, making the speciﬁc assumption of a homogeneous
director ﬁeld inside the droplet [13–15]. Experiments
however could only characterize late stage kinetics and
thus progress was hindered for several decades until fairly
recently, where unusually long size of carbon nanotubes
are used in optical microscopy to study the nucleation of
nematic tactoids [16].

Computer simulations, on the other hand, face the
challenge of deﬁning clusters unequivocally as well as
in developing algorithms to sample rare events. Monte
Carlo (MC) studies of nucleation events on hard sphe-
rocylinders (HSC) of two diﬀerent aspect ratios are per-
formed by Cuetos et al [4, 17], who reported nucleation
and growth as well as spinodal coarsening kinetics de-

pending on the degree of supersaturation. For a higher
aspect ratio of HSC molecules, they found an ellipsoidal
nematic cluster with homogeneous director conﬁguration
that eventually grew to span the system size. More re-
cently, in MC simulations, spherical nanodroplets with
a radial hedgehog defect with a Saturn-ring at the core,
bipolar pole-centered boojum defects and a uniform ﬁeld
structure has been reported [18]. It is worth mentioning
that kinetic pathways obtained through MC technique
may be misleading, as the algorithm samples the Gibbs
distribution in equilibrium without an insight of a deﬁ-
nite route to equilibrium when perturbed. More recent
studies by Vanzo and coworkers use coarse-grained molec-
ular dynamics (MD) simulation on Gay-Berne mesogens,
where morphology of freely suspended aspherical nan-
odroplets are studied [11]. Although MD provides a more
well-deﬁned temporal route than the MC technique, ne-
matic ordering is often best discussed through coarse-
grained methods. Nonetheless, a top-down approach
from a mesoscopic theory to nanoscale, as Vanzo and
coworkers mention is amazingly good even on the nano-
range, while a scale invariant form of the dynamical equa-
tions can be constructed, thus allowing the applicability
of equations from astrophysical scales (e.g. Kibble mech-
anism [19]) down to nanoscales, when the phenomeno-
logical parameters of the theory can be identiﬁed.

Within

mesoscopic

Ginzburg-Landau-deGennes
(GLdG) ﬁeld theory using deterministic overdamped
kinetics, the geometric structure of droplets have been
studied in the past two decades by making several
simplifying assumptions [20–22] and later through a
method of lines (MOL) computation of the tensorial
equations by the author and coworkers [23]. Prinsen et
al studied conformation of nematic tactoids in isotropic
medium within a Frank-Oseen description of the elastic
free energy [24], where not only the uniaxial and
biaxial scalar order are assumed invariant but a planar
anchoring of the director with curved interface was also
enforced through a phenomenological Rapini-Papoular
(RP) surface energy term [25]. Minimization of the
energy yielded diﬀerent morphologies of tactoids de-
pending on the elastic stiﬀness and anchoring strength.
It is worth highlighting that in nucleation studies, both
(i) the deﬁnition of the appropriate free energy, and (ii)
the dynamical prescription, are not obvious a priori.
For a pure component bulk nematogenic ﬂuid,
the
surface terms are solely encoded in the inhomogeneous
contributions to the GLdG energy, when surface to
bulk energy ratio is small and ﬁnite size eﬀects are
not important. For a two dimensional nematic ﬁlm,
Lansac et al studied the nucleation of nematic (isotropic)
droplets in isotropic (nematic) medium by accounting
for contributions from elastic anisotropy without a
RP-term [20], ﬁnding ellipsoidal nematic droplets with
integer topological charge for both positive and negative
values of anisotropy. Bubble coalescence resulted in a
nematic ﬁlm with half-integer defect - anti defect pairs.
This state is quenched to a superheated metastable ne-

2

matic state, where defect cores served as heterogeneous
nucleation centres. Heating generated isotropic bubbles
at defect cores that coalesced to span the system size
with a ballistic growth law.

In a deterministic GLdG prescription, a droplet can-
not spontaneously nucleate due to the absence of thermal
ﬂuctuations. To understand how thermal ﬂuctuations in-
ﬂuence the surface elasticity and hence the dynamic and
structural evolution, two major advancement are needed
in (i) the theoretical formulation of a stochastic GLdG
description and (ii) a numerical prescription to integrate
the ﬂuctuating equations of motion of the orientation ten-
sor [26] paying special attention to the structure of the
noise and satisfying discrete ﬂuctuation-dissipation the-
orem (FDT) in equilibrium. The former question (i) was
addressed by Stratonovich [26], while the computational
challenge (ii) was overcome in recent work by the author
and coworkers [27]. The development of this technique
motivated the current study.

In this article, we examine the nucleation of uniaxial
nematic droplets in a metastable supercooled isotropic
medium and the nucleation of isotropic droplets in a
metastable superheated nematic medium, where thermal
ﬂuctuations drive the metastable state to spontaneously
nucleate droplets of stable phase that grow to span the
system size. By incorporating a GLdG description in low-
est order in derivatives excluding a RP-term and employ-
ing a stochastic relaxational kinetics, we address: (i) the
eﬀect of anisotropic elasticity on the transient geometric
structure of the droplets, (ii) the role of long-range inter-
actions in the temporal distribution of nucleation events
and (iii) the applicability of classical nucleation theory
(CNT) in studies of nucleation in anisotropic phases.

The paper is organized as follows: Section II delivers
a concise description of the GLdG model, stochastic dy-
namics as well as existing kinetic theories, while our nu-
merical procedure and cluster identiﬁcation criteria are
elaborated in Appendix (A-C). We discuss our central
ﬁndings in Sec III while Sec. IV contains our conclusions.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

A. GLdG theory and ﬂuctuating dynamics

The order parameter for isotropic-nematic phase tran-
sition is characterized by a symmetric, traceless tensor Q
which in component form reads [29],

where α, β ≡ x, y, z denote the Cartesian directions in
a local frame of reference, with S = (cid:104)cos2 θ − 1/3(cid:105), T =
(cid:104)sin2 θ cos 2φ(cid:105) are the scalar degree of uniaxial and biaxial
order (θ, φ are polar and azimuth angle in that frame and
angular average is over suﬃciently coarse-grained space),
n, l, m denote the director, codirector and joint normal

scription of Q =(cid:82) dΩf (x, u, t) uu , where Ω is the sub-

that forms an orthonormal triad. From a microscopic de-

tended solid angle at origin by an anisotropic molecule
positioned at x with orientation u at time t deﬁned by a
distribution f and uu denoting symmetric and traceless
part of the tensor uu, eq.(1) can be derived by expand-
ing f in a suitable basis and then identifying the coarse
grained variables [30]. The GLdG free energy consists of
homogeneous bulk term and distortions due to inhomo-
geneity, namely F = Fbulk + Felastic where

The bulk free energy Fbulk is displayed in ﬁg.[1(A)]
and exhibits an asymmetric well landscape, character-
izing the weakly ﬁrst order feature of the phase transi-
tion. T ∗, T ∗∗ denote the supercooling and superheating
spinodal temperature with Tc the clearing temperature.
The phase diagram, shown in ﬁg.[1(B)] is derived from
the free energy, where the phenomenological parameters
A{= A0(1−T /T ∗)} controls the sample temperature and
B the size disparity [31].
The ﬁrst two terms in the distortion energy Felastic
correspond to the isotropic and anisotropic elasticity with
the ﬁnal term being a higher order contribution. The
elastic constants L1, L2, L3 can be calculated from exper-
imental measurements of Frank-Oseen elastic constants,
splay (K1), twist (K2) and bend (K3) via the relation
[32],

K1 =

K3 =

4
9S2
4

(2L1 + L2 − L3S), K2 =

9S2
4

(2L1 − L3S),

(2L1 + L2).

(4)

Typically the third order term is neglected (L3 = 0) when
distortions are assumed to be concealed in the second

order terms only, leading to degenerate splay and bend
with twist constant either large or small depending on
the sign of L2 [29]. This is symbolically represented by
the ratio κ = L2/L1 (L1 > 0). For analytical conve-
nience, a common practice is to consider nematics in the
one-elastic approximation, where K1 = K2 = K3 results
to L2 = 0. However, experimentally measured values of
the constants in units of 10−7dyn for (a) 5CB at 25◦C
are K1 = 6.4, K2 = 0.3, K3 = 1.0 and (b) MBBA at
25◦C are K1 = 6, K2 = 4, K3 = 7.5 [33]. GLdG parame-
ters in units of Jcm−3 for (a) 5CB are B = 7.2, C = 8.8
and (b) B = 2.66, C = 2.76 for MBBA. These yields for
A = 10−3, (a) L1 = 0.649, κ = 40.667 for 5CB and (b)
L1 = 8.6534, κ = 1.2 for MBBA. Such clear contrast in κ
justiﬁes why one-elastic approximation is inappropriate
in a suitable description of diﬀerent nematogenic materi-
als. Recall that Felastic uniquely deﬁnes the surface cost
in a bulk ﬂuid without a need to include RP-term when
no impurities are embedded. RP-term is however nec-
essary when impurities are inserted to set the director
anchoring on the surface of the impurity [34].

The overdamped Langevin equation for nematic orien-
tation tensor in a limit where hydrodynamic interactions
be neglected can be written as [27],

∂tQαβ = −Γ[δαµδβν + δανδβµ − 2

δαβδµν] ×

+ ξαβ,

where the coeﬃcient of isotropic rotational diﬀusion Γ
controls the rate and the tensorial random force ξξξ, sym-
metrized and detraced, satisﬁes FDT to ensure Boltz-
mann distribution at equilibrium [35].

Details of the numerical procedure are outlined in Ap-
pendix (A-B) and the algorithm for the characterization
of the nucleus is presented in Appendix C.

and time step ∆t = 1. Deﬁnition of the parameters other than the GLdG free energy parameters are presented in Appendix A.

B. Nucleation kinetics

Below supercooling (above superheating) line in ﬁg.(1)
without any external drive, the system spontaneously
proceeds towards the nematic (isotropic) medium via
spinodal coarsening kinetics. The ﬁrst order nature of
the transition is manifest in a nucleation and growth ki-
netics, bounded by the binodal and spinodal lines. CNT
studies the critical size of the droplet, the energy of
the barrier height and the nucleation rate with the ba-
sic assumption, ﬁrst conjectured by Rayleigh [36], that
nucleation proceeds through the formation of growing
spherical droplets. The free energy of a blob consists
of competing bulk energy (a surface energy in two di-
mensions) and surface tension (a line tension in two di-
mensions) required to create an interface between stable
and metastable medium. This can be written as

F = − 4
3

πR3ρN ∆µ + 4πR2σ,

(6)

where R is droplet radius, ρN is the density of the nucle-
ated stable phase, ∆µ = L∆T /T ∗ is the chemical poten-
tial diﬀerence of the phases with L the emitted latent heat
due to change in temperature ∆T and σ being the interfa-
cial tension. Depending on supersaturation, any droplet
smaller than a critical size Rc shrinks to zero, while larger
than Rc disseminate till coalesce with other droplets to
span the system size. The critical droplet shape is ob-
tained by maximizing F resulting to Rc = 2σ/ρN|∆µ|
and the barrier height Fc = 16πσ3/3ρ2
N (∆µ)2. The nu-
cleation rate from Becker-D¨oring theory [37] is deﬁned
as I = Aexp[−Fc/kBT ], where A is a kinetic prefactor.
Typically in CNT, rate calculation is a formidable prob-
lem as computing A is outside the scope of experimen-
tal measures, thus other theories (Volmer-Weber) predict
higher rates too [38].

In nematics, due to the inherent anisotropy of the ﬁeld

variables, the free energy reads

(cid:90)

d3x[ρN ∆µ(Q)] +

d2x[σ(∂Q)].

(7)

(cid:90)

F = −

The non-trivial coupling between the principal values and
principal axes of the Q-tensor makes this problem com-

plex and renders analytical insight diﬃcult. For an ellip-
soidal droplet with homogeneous n, analytic expressions
can be derived from the above equations [17, 40]. How-
ever in Sec. III, we will show that in the presence of
aspherical droplets with embedded integer charged topo-
logical defect, the singular volume and surface integral re-
stricts the applicability of analytic approach at all stages
of the kinetics.

Nucleation and growth kinetics are often character-
ized by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK)
equation [41], which is

x(t) = 1 − e(t/T )m

,

(8)

where x(t) is the volume fraction of the nucleated sta-
ble phase at time t and m depends on the shape of the
droplet, T is a constant related with the growth veloc-
ity v of the droplet. For spherical isolated droplets with
number density n, simple analysis shows, m = 3,T =
(3/4πnv3)1/3. However, if we consider growing ellipsoidal
droplets with long axis h and short axis r, then the expo-
nent turns out to be m = 3,T = (9/8πnv3)1/3. Higher
exponents and fractional exponents are also seen in ex-
periments, conventionally calculated through a plot of
the equation,

ln[−ln{1 − x(t)}] = mln(t) − mlnT .

(9)

While the exponent m in JMAK equation is dictated by
the dimensionality of the droplet, departure from pre-
dicted value shows the inapplicability of simple theory
[eq.(8)], also inspiring belief of a breakdown of CNT.

III. RESULTS

Our central ﬁndings are summarized in terms of
droplet conformation, evolution of orientational order
and free energy, the growth law as well as temporal dis-
tribution of nucleation events, by comparing nucleation
pathways for transition from (a) isotropic to nematic
(I → N ) and from (b) nematic to isotropic (N → I)
state, where the initial phase is kept in a metastable
state. Two sets of numerical parameters used in both
computations are tabulated in Table I.

A. Nucleation of nematic droplets in isotropic

1. Droplet conformation

medium

We inspect the nucleation of nematic droplets in su-
percooled isotropic medium with the stochastic thermal
force driving the phase towards a uniaxial stable nematic
state. By incorporating diﬀerent magnitude and sign of
κ ensuring positivity of the Frank elastic constants, we
systematically discuss diﬀerent cases while comparing re-
sults with the athermal GLdG calculation [23].

Fig.(2) displays the scalar uniaxial order S, biaxial
order T , the director and codirector distribution {n, l}
as well as the Schlieren texture [∝ sin2(2θ)] for dif-
ferent κ at early and late stages of the dynamics. As
noted in panel(A-C) in uniaxial order, the incipient nu-
cleated droplet is circular for κ = 0, that corresponds
to K1 = K2, while the conformation for κ ≶ 0 is ellip-
tical. Uniform black and white domains in panel(D-F)

indicate diﬀerently oriented homogeneous droplets in an
isotropic environment, as also seen in the director dis-
tribution embedded atop the textures. Homeotropic an-
choring is preferred with the interface for κ = −1, corre-
sponding to K2 = 2K1, and planar degenerate anchoring
is favoured for κ = 1, corresponding to K2 = 2K1/3.
This is attributed to the fact that the total energy is
lowered for parallel (planar degenerate) or perpendicular
(homeotropic) anchoring of the director with the inter-
face, depending on whether twist constant is smaller or
larger than splay or bend. Therefore the results agree
well with previous ﬁnding using MOL computations [23],
where a circular nematic nucleus greater than Rc embed-
ded in the isotropic medium were allowed to evolve, as
well as MC and MD simulations [4, 11].
This portrayal however changes dramatically, as
prominently displayed in panel(G-I) for κ (cid:29) 0, where
conformation at κ = 18 corresponding to K2 = 0.1K1
are depicted. Panel(H) shows an elliptical droplet in S,

rier height for diﬀerent κ. A total of 800 independent runs

and the schlieren texture and the director architecture
in panel(G) illustrate an encapsulated singular defect of
topological charge −1, quantiﬁed through a Volterra pro-
cess [29]. The codirector l in panel(I) also has a singular
structure with the biaxiality T being maximum on an
ellipsoidal ring in the outer core of the droplet. This is
consistent with the understanding that planar I-N inter-
face exhibit local biaxiality for an increasing κ [42], that
manifests at curved interfaces.

The intermediate stage of the kinetics proceeds with
the growth of droplets to coalesce, where the homoge-
neous director conformation inside the droplet distort
abruptly. For κ ≤ 0, half-integer topological defects with
two-brush textures emerge due to coalescence, that cor-
responds to a lower value of S in the defect core. The
ordering kinetics proceed via defect - anti defect pair an-
nihilation, thus reducing the total free energy of the sys-
tem. For κ = 1, nontrivial defect structures, similar to
boojum defects, emerge at opposite poles of the droplet,
where S have saturated to the equilibrium value without
displaying any half-integer defects. For κ = 18, nega-
tive integer defects persist after coalescence even at late
stages while the nematic media gradually encroaches the
isotropic domain. This imply that the ﬂuctuations for-
bid generation of half-integer defects for κ > 0. Recall
that {n, l} being the hydrodynamic variables, relaxation
of the smallest Fourier mode takes longer time scale than
other non-hydrodynamic variables S and T . Thus, inho-
mogeneity in director and codirector distribution persist
at late stages of the kinetics.

By computing and visualizing results in three spatial
dimensions, we have checked the pictorial consistency of
the results [30]. However, nontrivial coupling between
space and orientation due to anisotropy can manifest
in quantitative mismatch, which is beyond the present
study.

2. Evolution of orientational order, free energy and growth

law

The growth and decay of average scalar uniaxial and
biaxial order is shown in panel(A) of ﬁg.(3). The sig-
moidal proﬁle of (cid:104)S(cid:105) in the upper panel with higher in-
termediate slope between two smaller slopes at early and
late stage of the kinetics is a typical characteristic of nu-
cleation followed by growth process. Nucleation takes a
longer time as κ is increased from negative to a large pos-
itive value. This is because critical nuclei appear when
the volume energy is large compared to the surface con-
tributions, with the later increases with an increasing κ.
Biaxiality (cid:104)T(cid:105) in the lower panel decreases in a step pro-
cess as the nematic phase is approached. A nonzero value
of (cid:104)T(cid:105) in equilibrium conveys departure from purely uni-
axial nematic medium, however the value decreases for
increasing κ. For high value of κ, (cid:104)T(cid:105) attains a max-
imum between a step decrease that corresponds to the
coalescence of biaxial rings in ﬁg.[2(I)].

Y = ln[−ln{1 − x(t)}] is computed from the proﬁle of
(cid:104)S(cid:105). Panel(C) of ﬁg.(3) displays the ﬁt to the JMAK
equation(9) with the intermediate slope, sketched with
grey lines, with scaling exponent m > 2 for all values of
κ, indicating to a breakdown of the simple theory and
applicability of CNT description. The inset shows the
growth of the ﬁrst nucleated cluster (cid:104)Nc(cid:105) at various stages
before and after coalescence. The growth law follows a
simple scaling form, (cid:104)Nc(cid:105) = at2 + bt + c, where a, b, c
are ﬁt parameters. While (cid:104)Nc(cid:105) for circular or elliptical
droplet scales ∼ L2, the growth law can be predicted as,

L(t) ∼ (at2 + bt + c)0.5.

(10)

This matches with the experimental ﬁnding that the dy-
namics evolve from a diﬀusive, thermally limited regime
to a ballistic, volume driven growth regime (see Ref.[6]
and references therein). The dashed vertical line in the
inset of panel(C) distinguishes between the nucleation
and growth regime at the early stage before droplet coa-
lescence and the long time diﬀusive dynamics, that cor-
responds to the late stage kinetics of the non-conserved
order parameter Q.

The total GLdG free energy and the contributions from
bulk and distortion energy are displayed in ﬁg.[3(B)]. The
elastic energy is an order less than the bulk energy, with
the later monotonically decreasing to the stable nematic
state. The elastic energy slowly increases and exhibits
an overshoot before decreasing to the equilibrium value.
The overshoot being maximum for κ = −1 corresponds
to the coalescence of droplets when the elastic energy is
maximized due to homeotropic director anchoring with
the interface. Total energy is found to be a monotonically
decreasing function in time.

Finally, panel(D) shows the nucleation rate as a func-
tion of barrier height for diﬀerent κ. A signiﬁcant depar-
ture from a decaying exponential signals the breakdown
of Becker-D¨oring theory.

3. Temporal distribution of consecutive nucleation events

Fig.(4) renders diﬀerent normalized histograms of ﬁrst
passage time of two consecutive nucleation events τ1, τ2.
As witnessed, both the distributions are sharply peaked
for κ < 0, that broadens further as κ is increased to a
positive value. Also, the distribution of ﬁrst and second
event is highly correlated for κ < 0. This can be jus-
tiﬁed by considering that due to lowest surface energy
compared to the bulk energy of the droplet, two nucle-
ation events are strongly correlated in time, although the
medium in supercooled isotropic state forbid long ranged
elastic interactions. As κ is increased further, the sur-
face energy dominates over the bulk energy, thus mak-
ing the nucleation events more independent. In inset to
panel(C), we show spatial proximity of two such inde-
pendent events in the isotropic environment. For κ = 18,

both distribution falls on top of each other depicting of
no memory of the nucleation events.

B. Nucleation of isotropic droplets in nematic

medium

Next we investigate isotropic droplet morphology, evo-
lution of the Q-tensor, growth kinetics and temporal
distribution of subsequent nucleation events in a super-
heated nematic medium, where thermal ﬂuctuations ren-
der the nematic state unstable towards a stable isotropic
phase. The numerical procedure is elaborated in Ap-
pendix B and similar to I → N nucleation scenario, we
consider both negative and positive values of κ. However
within feasible computational time, nucleation clusters
could be obtained only for κ ≤ 6.

1. Droplet conformation

Fig.(5) displays the scalar order S, Schlieren texture
and distribution of the director ﬁeld n for diﬀerent κ at
early and late stage of the dynamics. As seen in panel(A-
H), incipient droplets nucleate for diﬀerent κ ≶ 0. We
have conﬁrmed by increasing the correlation length λκ≶0,
that the droplet morphology is circular (elliptical) for
κ = 0(κ ≶ 0). A random distribution of white and black
patches inside the droplet is indicative of isotropicity,
while the planar degenerate anchored nematic medium
does not distort to host any integer or half-integer de-
fects.
In late stages of the dynamics, as displayed in
panel(I-L), uniform regions of uniaxial nematic domains
are squeezed to disperse from the equilibrium isotropic
state, that are marked with rectangular dashed boxes.

Unlike in the nematic nucleation scenario, the dynamic
process involved in orientational order to disorder tran-
sition proceeds with S → 0 and n → random ordering
following each other.

2. Evolution of orientational order, free energy and growth

law

Panel(A) of ﬁg.(6) shows the evolution of uniaxial and
biaxial order as well as the growth of isotropic nuclei for
diﬀerent κ. As found in upper panel, (cid:104)S(cid:105) takes a two step
decay process from nematic to isotropic state, while (cid:104)T(cid:105)
also depicts two minima before reaching the equilibrium
value. This is rather surprising, while intuitively nucle-
ation is followed by a growth process. The physical pic-
ture we speculate is that thermal ﬂuctuations change the
athermal energy maximum dramatically, thus droplet co-
alescence does not initiate after formation of the isotropic
bubbles. Although the athermal energy in ﬁg.(1) at su-
perheating spinodal has a maximum at a ﬁxed value of S,
but thermal ﬂuctuations broaden the zero curvature val-

ues to form a plateau. Thus only after an order higher
in time when volume energy gains over surface energy,
growth and coalescence of droplets initiates de novo. Re-
call that minimum in (cid:104)S(cid:105) corresponds to maximum in
(cid:104)T(cid:105), hence in lower panel, occurrence of two minimas
separated with a plateau is observed.

JMAK equation characterizes the intermediate growth
stage, sketched in panel(C) with grey lines with analo-
gous exponents m obtained during the growth stage in
nematic nucleation study. We show growth of critical
cluster (cid:104)Nc(cid:105) only for κ = 1, 6 in panel(D), while it was
not possible to keep track of single clusters due to very
small correlation length λ(κ≤0). The growth law is found
to obey eq.(10).

Finally panel(B) displays the total free energy and the
contributions from bulk energy and elastic distortions.
The elastic energy is one order less than the bulk energy,
as also found in the nematic nucleation kinetics. The
elastic energy slowly decreases while exhibiting two over-
shoots, with one prominent at late stage, before saturat-
ing to the equilibrium value. The overshoot corresponds
to maximization of the elastic energy during coalescence

of droplets. Both bulk and total free energy displays the
plateau where the growth process remains frozen in time.
As also evident, the plateau increases with an increasing
κ, thus increasing more surface energy to overcome by
the bulk energy.

3. Temporal distribution of consecutive nucleation events

Fig.(7) displays diﬀerent normalized histograms of ﬁrst
passage time of the nucleation event. As seen, the distri-
bution is sharply peaked for κ = −1, that broadens more
as κ is increased. The ﬁrst and second nucleation event
are always correlated, which is manifest by the long range
elastic interaction of the nematic superheated medium.
One of the surprising ﬁndings however is the bimodality
exhibited by the distribution at κ = 1. As ampliﬁed in
the inset to panel(C), the second peak in subsequent time
are also correlated. The reason for bimodality can be
understood as follows: quenching a planar anchored ne-
matic medium into superheated metastability introduces

FIG. 7.

distortion in the director distribution without any defor-
mation of the scalar order. The ordering process of the
director leads to a local melting of the nematic environ-
ment and thus onset of isotropic bubble nucleation. This
results into the ﬁrst peak in the histogram in panel(C).
However in the post nucleation stage, due to higher sur-
face to volume energy, bubbles shrink to expel from the
nematic medium. As shown in the upper inset, nucle-
ation happen once again at a later stage, with two con-
secutive events widely separated in space, marked with
numbers 1 and 2, however temporally correlated. This
should be compared with the nematic bubble nucleation
scenario displayed in the inset of ﬁg.[4(C)], where albeit
events 1 and 2 are spatially proximate, but the events are
temporally uncorrelated. Due to higher surface energy
cost for κ (cid:29) 0, the nucleation events in panel(D) are
monomodal, nonetheless correlated with a much wider
distribution extending over more than two decades in
time compared to smaller κ.

IV. CONCLUSION

By performing an extensive study of the ﬂuctuating ne-
matodynamic equation of the orientation tensor, where
director and codirector orient in three Cartesian direc-
tions but spatial variations are restricted to a plane, in
this article we have presented two distinct homogeneous
nucleation kinetic pathways of phase transformation. In
particular, we examined the role of (i) thermal ﬂuctua-
tions, (ii) anisotropic elasticity in bulk and (iii) surface
interfacial tension in determining droplet morphology,
growth kinetics as well as temporal distribution of suc-

cessive nucleation events. By applying a cluster labelling
algorithm, we have quantitatively compared the onset
of (a) nematic globules in supercooled isotropic medium
in I → N transition and (b) isotropic droplets in super-
heated nematic medium during N → I transition. Subtle
diﬀerence in nematic nucleation kinetics can be found, if
performed a spinodal coarsening following a quench below
the supercooling line, where coarsening of domains pro-
duce defect - anti defect pairs to annihilate. Conversely
above superheating line, disordered domain coarsening
leads to the stable isotropic state.

Our ﬁndings in nematic nucleation kinetics is pictori-
ally consistent when spatial variations are considered in
three dimensions. However quantitative diﬀerences may
exist, also in studies of conﬁned two dimensional geome-
try, for example, coverslips restricting the director, codi-
rector variation in the third dimension of a nematic ﬁlm,
while position and orientation are coupled due to inher-
ent anisotropy. Our ﬁndings are summarized below,
(a) Nucleation of nematic droplets in I → N tran-
sition: At early stage for small values of κ, ellipsoidal
droplets nucleate while the absence of anisotropy leads
to a circular shape of droplets. The director anchoring
inside the blob is homogeneous while degenerate planar
(homeotropic) anchoring with the interface is observed
for κ > 0(κ < 0). This is consistent with the numerical
ﬁndings in MC [4], MD [11] and MOL study of GLdG
equation [23], but contradictory with the predictions of
Lansac et al [20], where encapsulated integer charged de-
fects are seen for κ = {−4/7, 4/3} [parameter K = ±0.4
in their study can be recognized as κ = 2K/(1 − K)].
For large positive values of κ, we ﬁnd ellipsoidal droplets
with encapsulated defect of topological charge −1 and
biaxial elliptic rings at the outer droplet surface. The
width of the ring is dictated by the correlation length
λ(κ(cid:29)0). While κ cannot be arbitrarily small due to the
theoretical lower bound κ > −6 [43], we always ﬁnd ho-
mogeneous director conﬁguration for negative values of
κ.
At an intermediate stage, the sigmoidal proﬁle of (cid:104)S(cid:105)
is well-characterized by the JMAK equation, revealing
agreement of nucleation followed by a growth model,
though the exponents are found higher than m = 2,
thus signifying departure from a CNT description. (cid:104)T(cid:105)
on the other hand for small values of κ displays a step
decay to equilibrium value with an overshoot for large
κ, that corresponds to the coalescence of biaxial rings.
The bulk free energy shows a step decay during the tran-
sition, while elastic energy increases due to the bub-
ble coalescence, only to decay at a later stage with a
pronounced overshoot. The growth law is found to be
L ∼ (at2 + bt + c)0.5. Moreover, time distribution of
consecutive nucleation events are decorrelated as κ is
increased, gesturing to the fact that increased surface
energy and an absence of long range order in isotropic
medium makes two nucleation event temporally indepen-
dent.

At late stage of the dynamics, defect pairs of half-

10
integer charge appear for κ ≤ 0, while no defect pairs
are seen for any positive values of κ.

(b) Nucleation of isotropic droplets in N → I transi-
tion: At early stage for all values of κ ≶ 0, ellipsoidal
droplets nucleate while circular droplets emerge in the
absence of elastic anisotropy. Yet the kinetic pathway en-
coded in (cid:104)S(cid:105), unlike case (a), does not proceed via nucle-
ation following a growth model but surprisingly, spends
signiﬁcant time in the free-energy maximum, implying
that the point in thermal energy diagram been signiﬁ-
cantly broadened and the nucleation proceeds via a two-
step process. The temporal distribution of consecutive
events are always correlated and exhibited bimodality in
0 < κ < 6 domain. The physical picture being for κ = 1,
quenching to superheated state randomize {n, l} that re-
sulted into local melting of the nematic medium to host
isotropic bubbles (not topological defects), that dissolve
at early stage as the nematic ﬁlm self adjusted the di-
rector orientation into uniformity. The other peak of the
bimodal distribution is obtained when isotropic clusters
reappear at an intermediate stage of the dynamics.

Growth is triggered only when the volume energy wins
over the surface energy at an intermediate stage, to span
the system size which is well-characterized by JMAK
equation. The growth kinetics turned out to be iden-
tical with the nematic bubble nucleation study. Also,
biaxiality (cid:104)T(cid:105) indicates behavior as expected from the
(cid:104)S(cid:105) proﬁle, which is a two-step increment towards equi-
librium value. The spatial and temporal correlation due
to long range interaction of the anisotropic medium is
seen in subsequent nucleation events.

Finally, encroachment of uniform nematic domains by
coalesced isotropic droplets prevail the late stage kinetics
without formation of topological defect pairs. We seek
temperature-controlled novel experimental measures in
liquid crystalline system to verify the presented claims.

to expand Q =(cid:80)

i aiTi and ξξξ =(cid:80)

The tensorial equation (5) is solved on a regular two
and three dimensional lattice of size Lx, Ly, Lz in x, y and
z dimension. A direct numerical integration is forbidden
due to the fact that by choosing a principal frame (equiv-
alently by performing a similarity transformation), any
symmetric tensor can be diagonalized at a point which
does not diagonalize the matrix at other grid points. By
utilizing a property that any symmetric traceless tensor
can be expanded in a basis of ﬁve matrices T in three
dimensions, a legitimate way to project the equations is
i ζiTi (i = 1, . . . , 5)
so as the dynamics is contained in the basis coeﬃcients
ai(x, t) and ζi(x, t) [27]. One of the major contributions
gained in the stochastic dynamics been the construction
of the symmetrized detraced noise ξξξ with ﬁve ζi that cor-
responds to zero mean, unit variance independent Gaus-
sian white noise processes. This thus validates discrete-
FDT spectrum in all Fourier modes and we ﬁnd excellent
agreement in the static and dynamic correlation of Q
with theoretical result in isotropic and uniaxial nematic
phase [27]. Eq.(5) in the basis coeﬃcients reads as,

Appendix B: Procedure for in-silico experiments

To study I → N transformation, we prepare the initial
isotropic state by drawing S and T randomly from a nor-
mal distribution N (0, 2kBT ). cosθ is obtained from an
uniform distribution between −1 and 1, and φ between 0
and 2π to generate director n and codirector l. The joint
normal m is obtained through Gram-Schmidt orthogo-
nalization procedure. After making the transformation
Q → a, we evolve the nematodynamic equation(A1) for
800 diﬀerent random initial conﬁgurations for 103 SMOL
steps to sample the state space in isotropic phase. Start-
ing from this state point corresponding to a temperature
slightly above supercooling spinodal line, the production
runs are performed for 2 × 104 SMOL steps. Finally, an
inverse transformation a → Q is made to reconstruct the
tensor in every space point to analyze the results.
To study the N → I transformation, a uniaxial ne-
matic phase is constructed from a normal distribution
by S = Sc + N (0, Sc/100). We choose planar anchoring
for director n = (1/
2) where cosθ
is similarly sampled as previous. Evolving equation(A1)
for 400 initial conﬁgurations deep in the uniaxial nematic
phase are sampled for 103 SMOL steps. The ﬁnal state
served as the initial conﬁgurations for production runs,
where the nematic state was pushed to metastability by
quenching to a temperature nearly below the superheat-
ing spinodal line. Q ↔ a transformation, as in previous
case is performed to reconstruct Q at every grid point.

Appendix C: Identiﬁcation of nucleation event

To unambiguously sample the nucleation events and
identify clusters, we store results on every computational
step within a time interval in which the nucleation clus-
ter eventuates. We apply Hoshen Kopelman (HK76) al-
gorithm [45], ﬁrst developed in identiﬁcation of cluster
percolation in a lattice without periodicity, to label con-
nected clusters on the grid which are above (below) cer-
tain threshold. To identify nematic nuclei, we choose the
threshold value to be 70% of Seq. We implement peri-
odicity in both directions to overcome double counting
of connected clusters through periodic boundaries, miss-
ing in the original algorithm, and record ﬁrst and second
nucleation event. In case of isotropic nucleation, the al-

gorithm is set up to perform reversely, that is we choose
the threshold value to be 30% of Seq.

HK76 algorithm particularly ﬁnds usefulness in count-
ing the total number of grid points pertaining to a tagged
cluster of the stable phase that grows in time as the clus-

ter swells. This makes it simple to extract a length scale
and thus in obtaining a growth law without comput-
ing length scale from other conventional procedure, for
instance, scaling laws encoded in the direct correlation
function [23].
