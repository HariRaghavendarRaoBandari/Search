AN INTEGRAL FORMULA AND ITS APPLICATIONS

ON SUB-STATIC MANIFOLDS

JUNFANG LI AND CHAO XIA

Abstract. In this article, we ﬁrst establish the main tool - an in-
tegral formula (1.1) for Riemannian manifolds with multiple bound-
ary components (or without boundary). This formula generalizes
Reilly’s original formula from [15] and the recent result from [17].
It provides a robust tool for sub-static manifolds regardless of the
underlying topology.

Using (1.1) and suitable elliptic PDEs, we prove Heintze-Karcher
type inequalities for bounded domains in general sub-static mani-
folds which recovers some of the results from Brendle [2] as special
cases.

On the other hand, we prove a Minkowski inequality for static
convex hypersurfaces in a sub-static warped product manifold.
Moreover, we obtain an almost Schur lemma for horo-convex hy-
persurfaces in the hyperbolic space and convex hypersurfaces in the
hemi-sphere, which can be viewed as a special Alexandrov-Fenchel
inequality.

1. Introduction

Reilly established a series of integral formulas on hypersurfaces in
Euclidean space in [14] in early 70s and later generalized them to Rie-
mannian manifolds in [15]. Since then, this type of integral formulas
have been used for many problems in geometric analysis during the
past decades. Reilly’s formula is particularly useful for manifolds with
nonnegative Ricci curvature. However, for rest of the cases, not much
information can be obtained from the formula. Very recently, the sec-
ond named author together with Qiu, made a ﬁrst try to establish a
formula which is useful when manifolds allow negative curvature [17].
In particular, they can prove geometric inequalities which are sharp in
space forms.

Along the line of [17], we will prove a more general integral formula
which includes the previous work of [14, 15, 17] as special cases. More

interestingly, this new integral formula leads to geometric inequalities
which are sharp in a much larger class of Riemannian manifolds besides
the space forms.

The rest of the introduction will split into several parts. First, we
introduce the new integral formula. Then we give several Heintze-
Karcher type inequalities which can be proved by the new formula.
We note these inequalities, when on substatic warped product spaces,
are due to Brendle [2] by a completely diﬀerent method. In the end,
we will show that our elliptic method can be used to prove Minkowski
type inequalities and almost Schur type theorems.

The most general form of our integral formula is presented in Section
3, see Theorem 3.1. For applications in this article, we will only focus
on the following special case.

Theorem 1.1. Let (M n, ¯g) be an n-dimensional smooth Riemannian
manifold and Ω ⊂ M be a bounded domain with smooth boundary ∂Ω.
Let V ∈ C ∞(Ω) be a smooth function such that ∇
is continuous up
V
to ∂Ω.

where Ric is the Ricci curvature of (M, ¯g).

Section 2. Clearly, when V ≡ 1 and V · Q = Ric, we recover Reilly’s
original formula. Just as in Reilly’s original formula where non-negative

AN INTEGRAL FORMULA ON SUB-STATIC MANIFOLDS

Ricci in the interior integral is crucial for any likely applications, non-
negative deﬁnite (0, 2)-tensor Q in our integral formula plays a crucial
role in our setting.

For convenience, we introduce a Riemannian triple (M n, ¯g, V ) which
constitutes an n-dimensional smooth connected manifold M, a Rie-
mannian metric ¯g on M and a smooth nontrivial function V on M.
Throughout this paper, we assume n ≥ 3. We give the following deﬁ-
nitions.

Deﬁnition 1.2. A Riemannian triple (M, ¯g, V ) is called static if

(1.3)

∆V ¯g − ∇

2

V + V Ric = 0.

A Riemannian triple (M, ¯g, V ) is called sub-static if there exists a
smooth (0, 2)-tensor Q on M such that

(1.4)

V Q := ∆V ¯g − ∇

2

V + V Ric ≥ 0.

In both cases, we call V a potential function.

Our deﬁnition of static and sub-static Riemannian triples comes nat-
urally from and has roots in the study of static spacetime in general
relativity. More background details can be found in Section 2.

We now focus on using the integral formula to prove geometric in-
equalities for domains in static or sub-static Riemannian triples. Some
of the inequalities was initiated by Brendle et. al. [2, 4].

As the ﬁrst application of (1.1), we establish the Heintze-Karcher
type inequalities. Similar type inequalities have been studied [2] using
a parabolic approach, see also [20].

Diﬀerent from the previous work, besides assuming the Riemannian
triple is sub-static, we do not impose any rotational symmetry or topo-
logical constraints for the ambient manifolds. In particular, we allow
the domain to have multiple boundary components which corresponds
to a bounded region containing multiple event horizons on a time slice
of a static spacetime.

Theorem 1.3 (Heintze-Karcher type inequality). Let (M n, ¯g, V ) be an
n-dimensional sub-static Riemannian triple. Let Ω ⊂ M be a bounded
l=1 Nl satisfying the inner boundary condition
deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.3 and suppose the outermost boundary hyper-
surface Σ is mean convex. Assume V > 0 in Ω.

are constants. Moreover, if equality in (1.5) holds, then Σ is umbilical.
When τ = 0, i.e. ∂Ω has only one component Σ, then (1.5) is reduced

to

For relation between the constant cl, the scalar curvature R of (M, ¯g)
and the scalar curvature RNl of Nl, see Remark 2.4 (4). By assuming a
locally warped product structure around the horizon(s), c.f. Deﬁnition
2.1, we have the following results similar to the work in [2] but with
possibly ﬁnitely many horizons.

Corollary 1.4. Let (M n, ¯g, V ) and Ω be as Theorem 1.3. We further
assume M n has local warped product structure ¯g = dr2 + λ2
l (r)gNl, r ∈
[0, ǫl) for a small ǫl > 0 around its inner boundary component Nl.
Assume near the boundary Nl, V = λ′

where Vol(Nl, gNl) is the volume of the boundary component with respect
to its metric gNl. Moreover, if equality in (1.7) holds, then the boundary
Σ is umbilical.

As in the works of Ros [18] and Brendle [2], the Heintze-Karcher
inequality together with a Minkowski identity (or inequality) immedi-
ately imply an Alexandrov type rigidity theorem. The following theo-
rem is due to Brendle [2]. The only diﬀerence is when the base manifold
N satisﬁes RicN = (n − 2)ρgN , we drop conditions (H4) and (H4’) to
show umbilic hypersurfaces must be slice.

Theorem 1.5. (Brendle [2]) Let M n = [0, ¯r) × N n−1 be a sub-static
warped product manifold with metric ¯g = dr2 + λ(r)2gN , where N is
a closed manifold with RicN = (n − 2)ρgN for some ρ ∈ R, and the
potential function V = λ′(r) satisﬁes H.1 or H.2 (see Section 2.1).

Let Σ ⊂ M be a closed orientable embedded hypersurface with con-
stant mean curvature. Then Σ is either a geodesic slice of an event
horizon or it is a geodesic sphere lying in the region with constant sec-
tional curvature.

Several remarks about Theorem 1.3–1.5 are given below.

Remark 1.6.

(i) Theorem 1.3 works for domains in general sub-static Riemann-
ian manifolds and allows more than two boundary components.
(ii) Our proof is completely diﬀerent from [2] and avoids the subtle

lemmata and Greene-Wu’s approximation technique.

(iii) In Theorem 1.5, by adding RicN = (n − 2)ρgN , we remove

conditions (H4) and (H4′) from [2].

In the past several decades, we have witnessed much successes of ap-
plying geometric ﬂows to prove geometric inequalities and there have
been numerous references which we will not list here. As an imme-
diately related example, Brendle’s proof on the Heintz-Karcher type
inequality [2] is based on a parabolic approach. The key of a success-
ful parabolic approach is ﬁnding monotonic quantities along the ﬂow.
When such a property of monotonicity is not available, we may have
to seek other ways. For instance, the following classical Minkowski
inequality for convex domains in Rn,

(1.8)

(cid:18)ZΣ

dA(cid:19)2

≥

describes a sharp relation among three geometric quantities, the volume
of a bounded convex domain, the surface area of the smooth boundary,
and the total mean curvature over the boundary. To our knowledge,
there is no geometric ﬂow approach for this type of inequalities.
It
seems unlikely to ﬁnd a monotonic quantity involving three quantities.

By an elliptic method together with (1.1), we can generalize Minkowski

type inequality (1.8) to sub-static Riemannian triples. For simplicity,
we only state the results for domains with one or two boundary com-
ponents. Domains with more boundary components can be similarly
considered.
Theorem 1.7. Let (M n, ¯g, V ) be an n-dimensional sub-static Rie-
mannian triple. Let Ω ⊂ M be a bounded domain with a connected
boundary ∂Ω = Σ on which V > 0. We further assume the second
fundamental form of Σ satisﬁes

Moreover, if there is one point in Σ at which the strict inequality holds
in (1.9), and equality in (1.10) holds, then Σ is umbilical and of con-
stant mean curvature.
Theorem 1.8. Let M n = [0, ¯r) × N n−1 be a sub-static warped prod-
uct manifold with metric ¯g = dr2 + λ(r)2gN , where N is an (n − 1)-
dimensional closed manifold and the potential function V = λ′(r) sat-
isﬁes H.2 (see Section 2.1).Assume Σ is homologous to ∂M, namely,
there is a bounded domain Ω such that ∂Ω = Σ ∪ ∂M. We further
assume the second fundamental form of Σ satisﬁes (1.9).

Then the following inequality holds:

Moreover, if there is one point of Σ at which the strict inequality holds
in (1.9), then equality in (1.11) holds if and only if Σ is a slice N × {r}
for some r ∈ (0, ¯r).

HV dA.

Theorem 1.7 recovers the result of the second named author in [21]
where the ambient spaces M were restricted to space forms. We follows
closely but simpliﬁes the argument in [21]. As observed in [21], the
condition (1.9) is satisﬁed when Σ is horoconvex in the hyperbolic
space or Σ is convex in the hemi-sphere. This strong convexity is
named as static convex by Brendle-Wang [5] for its correspondence in
static spacetime.

In the end, we prove a weighted Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality or a
weighted almost Schur lemma for closed hypersurfaces in space forms.
We use Hn to denote the hyperbolic space with curvature −1 and Sn
+
to denote the open hemi-sphere with curvature 1.

Theorem 1.9. Let Σ be a smooth, closed hypersurface in Hn (Sn
+
resp.). Let V = cosh r (cos r resp.), where r(x) = dist(x, p) for some
ﬁxed point p ∈ Hn (p ∈ Sn
+ resp.). In case of Hn we assume that the
second fundamental form of Σ satisﬁes (1.9), in particular, assume Σ
is horo-convex. In case of Sn

+ we assume Σ is convex.

Then the following inequality holds:

+. We believe the
weighted Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality holds true in general.

The almost Schur lemma in terms of scalar curvature has been shown
by de Lellis-Topping [8]. Later Ge-Wang [11] observed the equivalence
of the almost Schur lemma and the Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequality.
For closed hypersurfaces in space forms, an unweighted almost Schur
lemma in terms of mean curvature has been proved by Perez [13] along
the line of [8], see also [6]. Our proof of Theorem 1.9 relies on the
integral formula for closed hypersurfaces and the crucial observation
that a horo-convex (convex resp.) hypersurface in Hn (Sn
+ resp.) is a
closed sub-static manifold.

A similar weighted almost Schur lemma for sub-static closed mani-
folds, in the ﬂavor of de Lellis-Topping, is also presented at the end of
this paper.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we in-
troduce our notations and preliminaries.
In Section 3, we prove the
integral formula and also its variations. Section 4-6 will be devoted
to prove the Heintze-Karcher type inequality, the Minkowski type in-
equality and the Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequality.

We note that a similar result on Heintze-Karcher type inequality
appeared on arXiv in [19] recently. However, the method in [19] is
diﬀerent. The authors were interested in static manifolds motivated
from applications from general relativity.

2. Notations and preliminaries

Throughout this paper, we denote by ∇, ∆ and ∇

the gradient, the
Laplacian and the Hessian on (M, ¯g) respectively, while by g, ∇, ∆ and
∇2 the induced metric, the gradient, the Laplacian and the Hessian on
∂Ω respectively. Let ν be the unit outward normal of ∂Ω. We denote
by h(X, Y ) = ¯g(∇Xν, Y ) and H = tr¯gh the second fundamental form
and the mean curvature (with respect to −ν) of ∂Ω respectively. Let
dΩ and dA be the canonical measure of (M, ¯g) and ∂Ω respectively,
which will be omitted frequently for simplicity. Let Ric and R be the

8

JUNFANG LI AND CHAO XIA

Ricci curvature tensor and the scalar curvature of (M, ¯g) respectively.
For simplicity, we use a subscript to denote the covariant derivative
with respect to g, and a comma plus a subscript to denote that with
respect to ¯g, for example fα = ∇αf , R,i = ∇iR. We will use the
Einstein summation convention and also the convention that the Latin
indices run through 1 to n while the Greek indices run through 1 to
n − 1.

Our deﬁnitions of the static and the sub-static Riemannian triples in
Deﬁnition 1.2 has a deep background in the study of general relativity.

Let (M n, ¯g) be a time slice of a static spacetime cM n+1 = R × M n
with Lorentzian metricbg = −V 2dt2 + ¯g. Then the (0, 2)-tensor Q has
a natural physical meaning in the static spacetime. (cM ,bg) is said to
satisfy the Null Convergence Condition (NCC) if cRic(X, X) ≥ 0 for all
null vector ﬁelds X in TcM. It is known that the sub-static condition
the corresponding static spacetime (cM ,bg), c.f. [20]. More speciﬁcally,
Qij = bRijXiXj under orthnormal frames.

It is also well-known that a static Riemannian triple must be of
constant scalar curvature and the zero set {V = 0} is a totally geodesic
regular hypersurface, see e.g. [9, 7].

of a Riemannian triple (M, ¯g, V ) is equivalent to the NCC condition of

2.1. Local and global warped product spaces. The class of warped
product manifolds always serves as nontrivial examples in the theory of
general relativity. We brieﬂy review some elementary fact for warped
product manifolds here.

Let M n = [0, ¯r) × N n−1 be a warped product manifold with metric
¯g = dr2 + λ(r)2gN , where N is an (n − 1)-dimensional closed manifold
and λ : [0, ¯r) → R is a smooth positive function. Usually the following
two type of conditions are assumed:

H.1 λ′(0) = 1, λ′′(0) = 0 and λ′(r) > 0 for r ∈ (0, ¯r);
H.2 λ′(0) = 0, λ′′(0) > 0 and λ′(r) > 0 for r ∈ (0, ¯r).

In H.1 case, M is complete around N × {0} and this case corresponds
to condition (H1’-H2’) in [2]. In H.2 case, M has a horizon N × {0}
which corresponds to condition (H1-H2) in [2].

By a parameter transformation s = λ(r) so that s ∈ [s, ¯s), the metric

is transformed as

¯g =

V (s)2

Deﬁnition 2.1. A Riemannian triple (M, ¯g, V ) is said to have local
warped product structure near the the inner boundary horizons Nl (see
Deﬁnition 2.3) if locally around Nl the metric has the warped product
structure ¯g = dr2 + λ2
l (r)gNl, r ∈ [0, ǫl) for small ǫl > 0, where λl(r) is
a positive function on [0, ǫl).

Assume inside the ǫ-neighborhood of Nl, the potential function V =
(0) =

l(r). Then on each horizon, we have V (0) = λ′

2.2. Inner boundary condition. In this paper, the ambient man-
ifold M n may be complete without boundary, such as Rn and Hn;
may be compact with one or more boundaries such as Sn
+ and the
deSitter-Schwarzschild space; may also have a complete end together

10

JUNFANG LI AND CHAO XIA

with one or more compact boundary components, such as the anti-
deSitter-Schwarzschild space etc..

We ﬁrst modify the topology of M n by compactifying all of the ends
of M n except the chosen end by adding the points {∞k}. Consequently,
any compact orientable hypersurface divides M n into two regions, an
inside (the open set) and an outside which contains the chosen end. It
then makes sense to say one closed hypersurface is contained entirely
inside another one. We given the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Suppose the boundary of a domain Ω has several
connected embedded compact hypersurfaces as components, say ∂Ω =

Σ ∪

Nl. Σ is called the outermost boundary hypersurface if all the

τ[l=1

τ[l=1

other components Nl, l = 1, · · · , τ , are contained entirely inside it.

We mainly consider a bounded domain which possesses an outer-
most boundary component Σ together with no or several compact inner
boundary components. These inner boundaries are typically horizons,
see the deﬁnition of horizons in [1]. For convenience, we also introduce
the following inner boundary condition for a domain Ω in M.

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let (M n, ¯g, V ) be a Riemannian triple. Let Ω ⊂ M n

be a domain with smooth boundary ∂Ω = Σ ∪

Nl where Σ is an

outermost boundary component and Nl are compact inner boundaries.
Ω satisﬁes inner boundary condition if the following conditions on the
inner boundary components hold:

(i) Nl are minimal hypersurfaces;
(ii) The potential function V > 0 in Ω and V = 0 on each Nl,

l = 1, · · · , τ ;

(iii) On each of the inner boundary components (horizons),

(2.3)

∆V ¯gνν − ∇ννV

V

(z) > 0

for any z ∈ Nl.

Remark 2.4. We notice that

(1) Ω trivially satisﬁes the inner boundary condition when ∂Ω has

only one boundary component Σ.

(2) For proving theorems in this paper, it is enough to assume the
inner boundaries are minimal hypersurfaces instead of totally
geodesic.

AN INTEGRAL FORMULA ON SUB-STATIC MANIFOLDS

(3) If the manifold has a local warped product structure around the
horizons with the static potential being λ′(r) where λ(r) is the
warping function, then the inner boundary conditions are au-
tomatically satisﬁed in view of (2.2). Moreover, the quotient in
(2.3) are constants on each horizon.

(4) In case M n is a static manifold, then the event horizons are
all totally geodesic. Moreover by the Gauss equation and static
equation,on each inner boundary (event horizon), we have

where R is the scalar curvature of the static manifold which is

JUNFANG LI AND CHAO XIA

To prove the last statement, we recall the fact that if one bounded

domain is strictly contained in another one, e.g., Ω ( Ω′, then

λ1(Ω) > λ1(Ω′).

If Ω 6= ˚M , then there exists a bounded domain Ω′ ⊂ ˚M which strictly
contains Ω, i.e., Ω ( Ω′ ⊂ ˚M , then combining with (i), we have

λ1(Ω) > λ1(Ω′) ≥ 0.

3. An integral formula

In this section we will prove Theorem 1.1. For that purpose, we ﬁrst

prove a more general integral formula.

Theorem 3.1 (General Integral Formula). Let (M, ¯g) and Ω be as in
Theorem 1.1. Let Pij be a smooth symmetric (0, 2)-tensor on Ω and
P be the trace of Pij with respect to ¯g. We deﬁne Aij(f ) := f,ij +
n−1 P f ¯gij − f Pij and its trace with respect to ¯g is A(f ) = ∆f + P
n−1 f .

Then for any smooth functions V, f ∈ C ∞(Ω), we have

Remark 3.2. When V ≡ 1 and Pij = 0, (3.1) reduces to Reilly’s
original formula [14, 15]. when Pij = Rκ
ij = (n − 1)κ¯gij, (3.1) reduces
to the integral formula in [17].

Proof. It is direct to verify that

(cid:3)

Remark 3.5. It is direct to see from Lemma 3.4 that a static mani-
fold with potential V must be of constant scalar curvature at the point
with V = 0. One can show that the set {V = 0} is indeed a regular
embedded hypersurface and thus a static manifold must be of constant
scalar curvature everywhere see e.g. [9, 7].

We continue to prove Theorem 1.1. We ﬁrst analyze the second

boundary integration in (3.1). Using the deﬁnition of Pij, we have

In the second equality we also used (3.14). We arrive at (1.1) by re-
placing (3.15) and (3.16) into (3.1). The proof is completed.

An immediate consequence of Theorem 1.1 applying on a sub-static

Riemmannian triple is the following

In the last equality we used the Ricci identity.

4. Heintze-Karcher type inequality

In this section, we prove the Heintze-Karcher type inequalities.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. Suppose Ω 6= ˚M . By virtue of Lemma 2.5, we
know from the standard elliptic PDE theory that the following Dirichlet
boundary value problem

where cl = max

(l = 1, · · · , τ ), admits a unique smooth solution f ∈ C ∞(Ω). Notice
that by the inner boundary condition (c.f. Deﬁnition 2.3), on each Nl,
V = 0, HNl = 0 and cl < 0.

It now follows from the integral formula (1.1), the equation (4.1) and

the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality that

using the equation (4.1), we have

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.5. Clearly both geodesic slices and umbilical hy-
persurfaces lying in the region with constant sectional curvature are of
constant mean curvature.

Conversely, if Σ is of constant mean curvature, then the equality
holds in the Heintze-Karcher inequality. From Theorem 1.3, we know
Σ is umbilical and thus hαβ = cgαβ for some constant c. By the same
proof as in Theorem 1.1 of [2], Ric(eα, ν) = 0 for eα ∈ T Σ and thus the
normal vector ﬁled ν is an eigenvector of the Ricci tensor.

In the rest, we will show Σ is either a slice or an umbilical hypersur-
face lying in the region with constant sectional curvature. By direct
computations, we have the following decomposition of Ricci tensor, see
equation (2) in [2] or equation (1) in [3],

(4.6)

Ric = − Ψ(r)¯g − Φ(r)dr ⊗ dr.

where Ψ(r) =

and Φ(r) = (n − 2)(cid:18)λ′′

λ2 (cid:19).

Choose normal coordinates {∂r, ∂1, · · · , ∂n−1} at a point, where ∂α,

α = 1, · · · , n − 1 are coordinates of the base manifold N. Then

(4.7)

Ric(∂r) = −(Ψ + Φ)∂r, Ric(∂α) = −Ψ∂α.

This implies that ∂r is an eigenvector of the Ricci tensor with respect
to the eigenvalue −Ψ and {∂1, · · · , ∂n−1} constitutes a basis of the
eigenspace of Ricci tensor with respect to the eigenvalue −(Ψ + Φ).
When Φ(r) 6= 0 for some point on Σ, then Ricci tensor has two distinct
eigenvalues. Thus ν, as an eigenvector, is either parallel or orthogonal
to ∂r at this point.

In general, we denote S := {x ∈ Σ : Φ(r(x)) 6= 0}. There are two

alternatives: (i) S 6= ∅; (ii) S = ∅.

If S 6= ∅, there exists some point p and its neighborhood Np in S. We
claim ∂r is parallel to ν on S. In fact, if otherwise ∂r ⊥ ν, then ∂r is a
tangent vector ﬁeld for points in S and c = h(∂r, ∂r) = h∇∂r ∂r, νi = 0,
which is impossible. Therefore ∂r is parallel to ν on S and Φ(r(x)) is a

20

JUNFANG LI AND CHAO XIA

constant on S. We have now S is a non-empty open and closed set. It
follows from the connectedness of Σ that S = Σ. Hence ∂r is parallel
to ν on Σ which implies Σ is a geodesic slice.

If S = ∅, then Σ is contained in the region where Φ(r) = 0. By

computation, we have

(4.8)

Rijij = λ(r)2(ρ − λ′(r)2), Ririr = −λ(r)λ′′(r),

where {∂i} are coordinates vector for N and Rijij is the Riemannian
curvature tensor.
It is direct to see from (4.8) that the points with
Φ(r) = 0 are isotropic. We conclude from Schur’s Theorem that Σ is
contained in the region with constant sectional curvature. The proof
is completed.
(cid:3)

5. Minkowski type inequality

In this section, we prove the Minkowski type inequality. We ﬁrst
make some rearrangement for the boundary terms in the integral for-
mula (1.1).

connected boundary component Σ on which V > 0, then

V 2∇νw = cV on Σ,

Let S := {x ∈ Σ : (hαβ − V,ν

is non-empty, say p ∈ S. It is clear that S is open. Thus there is a
neighborhood Np ⊂ Σ such that (hαβ − V,ν
V gαβ) > 0 in Np. It follows
from (5.8) that z = αV for some α ∈ R in Np ⊂ Σ. We also have from

argument applied on Σ, we ﬁnd Σ is umbilical and of constant mean

We apply the solution f of (5.9) to the integral formula (5.1).
We take care of the integral over ∂Ω \ Σ = ∂M in (5.1). Since V = 0
and V,ν∂M = −λ′′(0) 6= 0 on ∂M, we see from the boundary condition
on ∂M that z = c0 on ∂M. Note also H = 0 on ∂M. It follows that

We are remained with the equality assertion. We ﬁrst show a ge-
odesic slice N × {r} satisﬁes the equality in (1.11). Let X = λ(r)∂r
be a conformal Killing vector ﬁeld such that ∇X = V ¯g and in turn
∇X = V ¯g − hX, νih. Thus we have the Minkowski identity

Conversely, if the equality holds, the same argument as in the proof
of Theorem 1.7 shows that Σ is of constant mean curvature. It follows
from Theorem 1.5 that Σ is a slice. The proof is completed.

6. Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequality in space forms

In this section we prove the weighted Alexandrov-Fenchel type in-

equality.
Proof of Theorem 1.9. Let K = 1 in the case Σ ⊂ Sn
+ and K = −1 in
the case Σ ⊂ Hn. We claim that under our assumption, Σ is a closed
sub-static manifold, namely

(6.1)

∆V gαβ − Vαβ + V RΣ

αβ ≥ 0,

where RΣ

αβ is the Ricci tensor of Σ.

Indeed, by the Gauss formula and the Gauss equation, we have

∆V = ∆V − V,νν − HV,ν = −K(n − 1)V − HV,ν,

Vαβ = V,αβ − V,νhαβ = −KV gαβ − V,νhαβ,

RΣ

αβ = Hhαβ − hαγhβγ + K(n − 2)gαβ,

Thus

(6.2)

∆V gαβ − Vαβ + V RΣ

αβ = (V hβγ − V,νgβγ)(Hgαγ − hαγ).

In the case Σ ⊂ Sn
+, Σ is convex. Thus Hgαγ − hαγ ≥ 0 and hβγ ≥
0 > V,ν
V gβγ ≥ 0 by assumption and
hβγ > 0 follows from this. In view of (6.2), we have (6.1) in both cases.

In the third equality, we used the Codazzi property of hαβ, which is a

we used the H¨older inequality.

On the other hand, applying the integral formula (1.1) for Ω = Σ
(note that Σ is an (n−1)-dimensional closed manifold) and using (6.1),
we have

It follows that

Combining (6.4) and (6.5), using again the equation (6.3), we con-
clude (1.12) holds. Inequality (1.13) follows from (1.12) by an algebra
computation. This is a key observation due to Ge-Wang [11].

Next we prove the assertion for the equality for the case Hn. Obvi-
ously, if Σ is a geodesic ball, then H and σ2(h) are both constants and
the equality holds.

Conversely, if the equality in (1.12) holds, by checking the above

proof, we see that

V(cid:19) = 0.

Since Σ is closed, we know there exists at least one elliptic point p at
which all the principal curvatures are larger than 1. It follows from (6.2)
that ∆V g − ∇2V + V RicΣ is positive-deﬁnite at p. From continuity we
know that ∆V g−∇2V +V RicΣ is positive-deﬁnite in a neighborhood Np
of p. In view of (6.7), we have f = V in Np. It follows then from (6.6)
that hαβ = H
n−1 gαβ = cgαβ in Np for some constant c > 1. Using (6.2)
again, we see that ∆V g − ∇2V + V RicΣ = n−2
n−1 c(cV − V,ν)g is positive-
deﬁnite in Np. Therefore the set S := {x ∈ Σ : ∆V g − ∇2V + V RicΣ >
0} is open and closed and thus S = Σ due to the connectedness of Σ.
Applying the above argument to all point in Σ, we conclude that Σ is
umbilical.

The proof for the case Sn

proof is completed.

A similar consideration as Theorem 1.9 gives a weighted version of

de Lellis-Topping type almost Schur lemma.
Theorem 6.1. Let (M n, ¯g, V ) be an n-dimensional (n ≥ 3) closed
sub-static Riemannian triple. Then the following inequality holds:

strict sub-static inequality holds, then equality in (6.8) holds if and only
if M is Einstein.

Since the proof is the same as that of Theorem 1.9. So we omit it.
