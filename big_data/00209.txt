GROUP C∗-ALGEBRAS WITHOUT THE COMPLETELY BOUNDED

APPROXIMATION PROPERTY

UFFE HAAGERUP

ABSTRACT. It is proved that:

(1) The Fourier algebra A(G) of a simple Lie group G of real rank at least 2 with ﬁnite

center does not have a multiplier bounded approximate unit.

(2) The reduced C ∗-algebra C ∗

r (Γ) of any lattice Γ in a non-compact simple Lie group
of real rank at least 2 with ﬁnite center does not have the completely bounded ap-
proximation property.

Hence, the results obtained by J. de Canniere and the author [dCH85] for SOe(n, 1),
n ≥ 2, and by M. Cowling [Cow83] for SU(n, 1) do not generalize to simple Lie groups
of real rank at least 2.

PREAMBLE BY ALAIN VALETTE

In spring 2015, I contacted Uffe Haagerup about his manuscript “Group
C∗-algebras without the completely bounded approximation property”,
written in 1986, and never published. I mentioned that Journal of Lie
Theory might be a good place to publish it. Uffe Haagerup liked the idea
and said he was willing to update the paper after the summer.

By a sad twist of fate, Uffe Haagerup tragically passed away in July
2015. After his untimely death, Maria Ramirez Solano volunteered to
type the manuscript, and Søren Knudby accepted to write an introduc-
tion and update the bibliography. We heartily thank both of them for
their help in making the manuscript available to the community. We also
thank Søren Haagerup for giving us permission to publish his father’s
paper.

INTRODUCTION

The Fourier algebra A(G) of a locally compact group, introduced by Eymard [Eym64],
consists of the matrix coefﬁcients of the regular representation. The Fourier algebra is the
predual of the group von Neumann algebra M(G) generated by the regular representation.
The multipliers M A(G) of the Fourier algebra consists of those continuous functions ϕ
on G such that ϕψ ∈ A(G) for every ψ ∈ A(G). One identiﬁes ϕ with the corresponding
operator mϕ on A(G), and the multiplier norm kϕkMA is the operator norm of mϕ. If the
transposed operator m∗
ϕ on M(G) is completely bounded, we say that ϕ is a completely
bounded multiplier. The space of completely bounded multipliers is denoted M0A(G),
and the completely bounded multiplier norm kϕkM0A is the completely bounded operator
norm of m∗

ϕ. We refer to the papers [Cow89, dCH85] for details.

Leptin [Lep68] showed that the Fourier algebra A(G) has an approximate unit bounded in
norm if and only if G is amenable. In [dCH85], de Cannière and the author showed that
the Fourier algebra of the non-amenable group SOe(n, 1), n ≥ 2, admits an approximate
unit bounded in the completely bounded multiplier norm. In [Cow83], Cowling obtained
similar results for SU(n, 1). In the ﬁrst half of the paper, we show these results do not
generalize to simple Lie groups of real rank at least 2:

Theorem 1. The Fourier algebra A(G) of a simple Lie group G of real rank at least 2
with ﬁnite center does not have an approximate unit bounded in multiplier norm.

The second half of the paper is concerned with applications to operator algebras. It is
shown that the Fourier algebra A(Γ) of a lattice Γ in a second countable locally compact
group G has an approximate unit bounded in the completely bounded multiplier norm if
and only if the Fourier algebra A(G) of G has such an approximate unit (Theorem 2.3).
It is also shown that, for a discrete group Γ, the Fourier algebra A(Γ) has an approximate
unit bounded in the completely bounded multiplier norm if and only if the reduced group
r (Γ) has the completely bounded approximation property, if and only if the
C∗-algebra C∗
group von Neumann algebra M(Γ) has the (σ-weak) completely bounded approximation
property (Theorem 2.6). As a corollary, C∗
r (Γ) does not have the completely bounded
approximation property when Γ is a lattice in a simple Lie group of real rank at least 2
with ﬁnite center (Corollary 2.7).
The paper ends with an appendix containing a characterization, due to Bo˙zejko and Fendler,
of completely bounded multipliers.
A preliminary version of this paper was completed in 1986 and has circulated among ex-
perts in the ﬁeld. We now mention some of the developments related to this paper up until
its publication.
In 1989, Cowling and the author [CH89] showed that the Fourier algebra of a simple Lie
group with ﬁnite center and real rank 1 admits an approximate unit bounded in the com-
pletely bounded multiplier norm. This generalized the results of [Cow83, dCH85]. The
condition of ﬁnite center was subsequently removed by Hansen [Han90].
In 1996, Dorofaeff [Dor93, Dor96] removed the ﬁnite center condition from Theorem 1,
thus giving a complete characterization of simple Lie groups whose Fourier algebras ad-
mits multiplier bounded approximate units.
In 2005, Cowling, Dorofaeff, Seeger, and Wright [CDSW05] extended the previous results
to cover many non-simple Lie groups including all real algebraic linear groups.
In 2012, Ozawa gave a short proof of Theorem 1 (see [Oza12] and [Knu15]).
In 1994, a weaker approximation property (called the Approximation Property or simply
the AP) than the one considered in Theorem 1 was introduced by Kraus and the author in
[HK94]. In 2011–2013, it was shown by Lafforgue, de la Salle, de Laat and the author
[HdL13, LDlS11] that simple Lie groups G of real rank at least 2 with ﬁnite center do not
even have the AP, thus improving Theorem 1. The ﬁnite center condition was subsequently
removed in [HdL16].

1. PROOF OF THEOREM 1

Reducing the problem to SL(3, R) and Sp(2, R). In [Wan69], Wang proved that any
simple Lie group G with ﬁnite center and real rank at least 2 has Kazhdan’s property (T ),

GROUP C∗-ALGEBRAS WITHOUT THE COMPLETELY BOUNDED APPROXIMATION PROPERTY

by using the fact that all these groups contain a closed subgroup G′ with ﬁnite center and
locally isomorphic to either SL(3, R) or SO(2, 3) (cf. [BT65, Theorem 7.2]). If G′ fails to
have a multiplier bounded approximate unit for its Fourier algebra, so does G (cf. [dCH85,
Proposition 1.12]). It is elementary to check, that if F is a ﬁnite normal subgroup of a
locally compact group H, then A(H) has a multiplier bounded approximate unit if and
only if A(H/F ) has a multiplier bounded approximate unit. Thus if G′ and G′′ are locally
isomorphic simple Lie groups with ﬁnite center, then A(G′) has a multiplier bounded
approximate unit if and only if A(G′′) has a multiplier bounded approximate unit. Hence,
to prove Theorem 1 it sufﬁces to consider the two groups SL(3, R) and SO(2, 3) of real
rank 2. But SO(2, 3) is locally isomorphic to Sp(2, R) (cf. [Hel78, p. 519]). So we can as
well work with SL(3, R) and Sp(2, R).

Case SL(3, R). Consider the closed subgroup G0 of SL(3, R) consisting of the 3 × 3-
matrices of the form

A ∈ SL(2, R), b1, b2 ∈ R.

Note that G0 is isomorphic to the semidirect product SL(2, R)×α R2, where α is the usual
action of SL(2, R) on R2. We will show that already G0 fails to have a multiplier bounded
approximate unit. Put

intervals around the zeroes of y2 − z2, and let the length of the intervals go to zero).
Moreover

I(ϕ) − J(ϕ) = π2ϕ(0, 0).

Proof (sketch). I, J are the distributions on R2, whose Fourier transforms are given by the
L∞-functions

bI(t, u) = π2χ{u2>t2},
bJ(t, u) = −π2χ{u2<t2},

where χ denotes the characteristic function, and D → bD is the natural extension of the

Fourier transform on R2, which on the L1-functions is given by

ei(ty+uz)f (y, z) dy dz.

bf (t, u) =ZZR2

Hence bI − bJ = π2, which is the Fourier transform of π2 times the Dirac measure at

where J0 is the zero-order Bessel function.

Proof (sketch). To compute bK, observe that K is SO(1, 1)-invariant. Hence bK can only
depend on u2−t2, so it is sufﬁcient to compute bK(t, 0) and bK(0, u). But bK(0, u) = J0(u)

Proof (sketch). Note that one cannot permute the order of integrations dz, dy (cf. Lemma
B). However, it is not hard to check that dy and dx can be permuted. We have to prove that
D corresponds to an operator T ∈ M(N ), the von Neumann algebra associated to the left
regular representation of N , such that kTk ≤ 2π3 (cf. [Eym64]). The Heisenberg group
N is of type I, and the inﬁnite dimensional irreducible representations of N are given by
(ρa)a∈R\{0} acting on L2(R) by:

(ρa(x, 0, 0)f )(t) = eiaxtf (t)
(ρa(0, y, 0)f )(t) = f (t − y)
(ρa(0, 0, z)f )(t) = eiazf (t)

where f ∈ L2(R). The remaining irreducible representations are all one-dimensional, and
they form a null set for the Plancherel measure on bN . For f, g ∈ C∞

Moreover, K is the kernel of a bounded operator on L2(R) of norm ≤ π because it is the

The lemma follows now from Lemma D.

Proof of Theorem 1 for SL(3, R). It is sufﬁcient to show that the subgroup G0 does not
have a multiplier bounded approximate unit for A(G0):

Assume that there existseϕn ∈ A(G0), n ∈ N, such that supn keϕnkMA(G0) < ∞ and

for all ϕ ∈ A(G0).

Since C∞

c (G0) is dense in A(G0), we can choose the eϕn-functions in C∞
averaging by K0-elements from left and right, we can also obtain that that eϕn is K0-
biinvariant. Note that eϕn → 1 uniformly on compact subsets of G0. Put

c (G0), and by

lim

n→∞kϕeϕn − ϕkA(G0) = 0

Then

ϕn = eϕn|N .

n we get

ϕn(x, 0, 0)2

kϕnkA(N ) = kϕnkMA(N ) ≤ keϕnkMA(G0).
The ﬁrst equality holds because N is amenable. Thus supn kϕnkA(N ) < ∞, and by
Lemma A, ϕn = ϕn ◦ γ for all n ∈ N. By using Lemma E to ϕ2

Case Sp(2, R). The group Sp(2, R) is the set of g ∈ GL(4, R) that leaves invariant the
exterior form

x1x3 − x3x1 + x2x4 − x4x2,

(cf. [Hel78, p. 445]). For our purpose, it is convenient to permute the third and fourth
coordinate in R4, so we will instead consider the group G ∼= Sp(2, R) of invertible 4 × 4-
matrices that leave invariant the form:

x1x4 − x4x1 + x2x3 − x3x2.
G is a 10 dimensional connected Lie group with Lie algebra

Let (s, u, v) be the dual coordinates to (x, z, w). The transpose of θy is

θy(x, z, w) = (x, z − yx, w − 2yz + y2x).
bθy(s, u, v) = (s − yu + y2v, u − 2yv, v).

The irreducible representation of N can now be obtained by the Mackey machine (cf.

Since {(s, u, v)| v = 0} is a null set in R3, the ﬁrst type of orbits gives sufﬁciently many
irreducible representations to disintegrate the regular representation of N . Let ρa,b be
the irreducible representation coming from the parabolic orbit with vertex (b, 0, a), a ∈

2. RESULTS ABOUT LATTICES IN LIE GROUPS

A lattice Γ in a locally compact group G is a closed discrete subgroup, for which G/Γ has a
bounded G-invariant measure. A locally compact group that admits a lattice is necessarily
unimodular (cf. Deﬁnition 1.8 and Remark 1.9 in [Rag72]).
In the following, Γ denotes a lattice in a second countable locally compact group G. In this
case, Γ is countable and the quotient map ρ : G → G/Γ has a a Borel cross section. Let Ω
be the range of a Borel cross section. Then

G = [γ∈Γ

Ωγ

(disjoint union).

Let µ be the Haar measure on G. Since Γ is countable, µ(Ω) > 0. Moreover, the quotient
map ρ is a bijection of Ω onto G/Γ, that carries µ|Ω onto a G-invariant measure on G/Γ.
Thus by the assumption that Γ is a lattice, µ(Ω) < ∞. In the following we will assume
that µ is normalized such that

µ(Ω) = 1.

Let µΓ be the counting measure on Γ. For every bounded function ϕ on Γ, the function

is a well-deﬁned bounded continuous function on G because χΩ ∈ L1(G), G is unimodu-
lar, and because χΩ ∗ ϕµΓ is the bounded function given by

bϕ = χΩ ∗ ϕµΓ ∗eχΩ

Lemma 2.1.

(χΩ ∗ ϕµΓ)(ωγ) = ϕ(γ),

γ ∈ Γ, ω ∈ Ω.

kbϕkA(G) ≤ kϕkA(Γ)
kbϕkM0A(G) ≤ kϕkM0A(Γ).

(1) If ϕ ∈ A(Γ) then bϕ ∈ A(G) and
(2) If ϕ ∈ M0A(Γ) thenbϕ ∈ M0A(G) and
(1) If ϕ ∈ A(Γ), then there exists f, g ∈ ℓ2(Γ) such that ϕ = f ∗eg, kfk2kgk2 = kϕkA(Γ).
kϕkA(Γ), and f1 ∗eg1 = bϕ. This proves (1).

Put f1 = χΩ ∗ f µΓ, g1 = χΩ ∗ gµΓ. Then f1, g1 ∈ L2(G), kf1k2kg1k2 = kfk2kgk2 =

(2) Every z ∈ G has a unique decomposition

Proof.

z = ωγ,

ω ∈ Ω, γ ∈ Γ.

GROUP C∗-ALGEBRAS WITHOUT THE COMPLETELY BOUNDED APPROXIMATION PROPERTY

11

The γ-part in the decomposition will be denoted by γ(z). For x ∈ G, we let τx : Ω → Ω be
the map given by τx(ω) = ω′, where ω′ is the Ω-component of xw in the decomposition

xω = ω′γ′,

ω′ ∈ Ω, γ′ ∈ Γ.

Each τx is a Borel isomorphism of Ω because τx corresponds to left translation by x in
G/Γ with the Borel isomorphism Ω → G/Γ given by the quotient map. Since the latter
Borel isomorphism carries µ|Ω to an invariant measure on G/Γ, it follows that µ|Ω is τx-
invariant.

We rewrite the functionbϕ = χΩ ∗ ϕµΓ ∗eχΩ in a suitable way. Observe ﬁrst that

(χΩ ∗ ϕµΓ)(ωγ) = ϕ(γ),

ω ∈ Ω, γ ∈ Γ,

or equivalently,

Therefore,

(χΩ ∗ ϕµΓ)(x) = ϕ(γ(x)),

x ∈ G.

bϕ(x) =ZG
=ZxΩ
=ZΩ

ϕ(γ(y))χΩ(x−1y) dµ(y)

ϕ(γ(y)) dy

ϕ(γ(xω)) dµ(ω).

For x, y ∈ G and ω ∈ Ω:

Thus,

xω = τx(ω)γ(xω)
yω = τy(ω)γ(yω).

yx−1τx(ω) = yω(xω)−1τx(ω)

= τy(ω)γ(yω)γ(xω)−1.

Since τx(ω) ∈ Ω and γ(yω)γ(xω)−1 ∈ Γ, it follows that

γ(yx−1τx(ω)) = γ(yω)γ(xω)−1.

Hence

ZΩ

ϕ(γ(yω)γ(xω)−1) dµ(ω) =ZΩ

However, since dµ(ω) is invariant under τx, the latter integral is equal to

ϕ(γ(yx−1τx(ω))) dµ(ω).

(2.1)

Hence, ∀x, y ∈ G:

ZΩ
ϕ(γ(yx−1ω)) dµ(ω) = bϕ(yx−1).
bϕ(yx−1) =ZΩ

ϕ(γ(yω)γ(xω)−1) dµ(ω).

We can now apply Bozejko-Fendler’s result that M0A(G) coincides with the space of
Herz-Shur multipliers on G with same norm [BF84]: Since Γ is discrete, it implies, that
there exist a Hilbert space H and bounded maps ξ, η from Γ to H such that

Let K ⊆ G be compact. Then the functions h(x · ), x ∈ K form a compact subset of

Similarly,

By the assumption on ϕα, gα → χK−1L uniformly on K −1L. Moreover, gα vanishes

Remark. The proof of (2) =⇒ (3) in Lemma 2.2 is due to Michael Cowling (private
communication). It substitutes a previous proof of ours, that was valid only for Lie groups.

Theorem 2.3. Let Γ be a lattice in a second countable locally compact group G, and let
k ∈ [1,∞[. then the following conditions are equivalent.

(1) A(G) has an approximate unit (ϕα), such that kϕαkM0A(G) ≤ k, for all α.
(2) A(Γ) has an approximate unit (ψα), such that kψαkM0A(Γ) ≤ k for all α.

Proof. (1) =⇒ (2) follows from [dCH85], and is valid for any closed subgroup Γ ⊆ G.
(2) =⇒ (1): Assume that (ψα) ⊆ A(Γ) satisﬁes (2), and put bψα = χΩ ∗ ψαµΓ∗eχΩ, where

net (ψα) is uniformly bounded, and since ψα → 1 pointwise in Γ, also
It is easy to check that the map ϕ 7→ bϕ = χΩ ∗ ϕµΓ ∗ eχΩ from ℓ∞(Γ) to L∞(G) is
the transpose of a bounded map from L1(G) to ℓ1(Γ). Hence, bψα → 1G in σ(L∞, L1)-

Corollary 2.4. Every lattice Γ in a simple Lie group of real rank at least 2 fails to have a
complete multiplier bounded approximate unit.

Proof. Follows from Theorem 2.3 and Theorem 1.

Let Γ be a discrete group, and let M(Γ) be the von Neumann algebra associated with the

Then tr is a normal faithful trace on M(Γ).

(1) If T is completely bounded, then ϕT ∈ M0A(G), and

kϕTkM0A(Γ) ≤ kTkCB.

(2) If T is of ﬁnite rank, then ϕT ∈ ℓ2(Γ).

Proof. (1): Since λ ⊗ λ is unitarily equivalent to λ ⊗ 1ℓ2(Γ) where 1ℓ2(Γ) is the trivial
[Dix77, 13.11.3] and [Fel62]), there exists a normal
representation of Γ on ℓ2(Γ) (cf.
*-isomorphism π of M = M(Γ) onto a von Neumann subalgebra N of M ⊗ M such that

π(λ(x)) = λ(x) ⊗ λ(x),

x ∈ G.

Let ε be the normal conditional expectation of M⊗ M onto N that leaves tr⊗ tr invariant.
Then, since ε is orthogonal with respect to the inner product given by tr ⊗ tr, one gets
easily that

instead T is a completely bounded map on M(Γ), then we let,

3. APPENDIX: ON COMPLETELY BOUNDED MULTIPLIERS AND

HERZ-SHUR-MULTIPLIERS.

In Section 2, we used Bozejko and Fendler’s results [BF84] that M0A(G) coincides iso-
metrically with the space B2(G) introduced by Herz in [Her74]. Their result relies heavily
on a characterization of B2(G) found by Gilbert ([Gil, Theorem 4.7]). However, Gilbert’s
paper, has never been published, so for the convenience of the reader, we give below a
self-contained proof of the result needed in Section 2.
Let a∗ b denote the Schur product (a∗ b)ij = aij bij of complex n× n-matrices in Mn(C),
the operator norm of a when Mn(C) acts
and let kak be the C∗-norm on Mn(C), i.e.
on the Euclidean space ℓ2({1, . . . , n}). We let k kS denote the Schur multiplier norm on
Mn(C), i.e.

kakS = sup{ka ∗ bk | b ∈ Mn(C), kbk ≤ 1}.

Let ≤ be the usual ordering in Mn(C) as a C∗-algebra, i.e. a ≥ 0 iff a = a∗ and all
eigenvalues of a are nonnegative. It is well known that

Hence, if a ≥ 0 then the operator Ma : b 7→ a ∗ b is positive on the C∗-algebra Mn(C),
and therefore,

a ≥ 0, b ≥ 0 =⇒ a ∗ b ≥ 0.

we get aij = hξi, ηji, and kξik2 = dn+i,n+i ≤ 1, kηik2 = dii ≤ 1, for i = 1 . . . , n.
(3) =⇒ (2): Let ξi, ηj be as in (3), put

If we let ηn+i = ξi, i = 1, . . . , n. Then

This implies that d is positive hermitian, because, for λ1, . . . , λ2n ∈ C,

(4) There exist a Hilbert space H and two bounded maps ξ, η : G → H as in (3) with
the additional property that the coordinate functions ξi and ηi (with respect to
any orthonormal basis (ei)i∈I of H) are continuous and the families {ξi}i∈I and
{ηi}i∈I are locally countable.

It is elementary to check that f ∗

preserve norms,

i=1 fii = 1, so N =

Proof. (1) =⇒ (2) (cf. [BF84]): Let x1, . . . , xn ∈ G and let (eij)n

αij ∈ C.
Let Mϕ : M(G) → M(G) be as in [dCH85, Section 1]. Then by (1),

where in is the identity on Mn(C). But,

kMϕ ⊗ ink ≤ k,

Therefore

and hence for aij ∈ C,

Mϕλ(x) = ϕ(x)λ(x),

x ∈ G.

Since fij in this inequality can be exchanged by the standard matrix units eij of Mn(C), it
follows that the matrix (ϕ(x−1
i xj ))i,j=1,...,n as well as its transpose has Schur multiplier
norm ≤ k.
(2) =⇒ (3): Let (F ,⊆) be the family of all ﬁnite subsets of G ordered by inclusion.
Assuming (2), we can for each F ∈ F ﬁnd a Hilbert space HF and bounded maps

with

and

ξF , ηF : F → HF .

x∈F kξF (x)k ≤ k1/2,
sup

x∈F kηF (x)k ≤ k1/2,

ϕ(y−1x) = hξ(x), η(y)i,

x, y ∈ F.

(3) follows now easily by a standard ultraproduct argument: Let namely U be a coﬁnal
ultraﬁlter on (F ,⊆) (i.e. an ultraﬁlter that contains all sets of the form {F ′ ∈ F | F ′ ⊇

GROUP C∗-ALGEBRAS WITHOUT THE COMPLETELY BOUNDED APPROXIMATION PROPERTY

20

F}, where F ∈ F), and let HU be the ultraproduct of (HF )F ∈F corresponding to U. For
x ∈ G, we let ξ(x), and η(x) be the elements in HU with representing sequences

ξ(x) = (ξF (x))F ∈F
η(x) = (ηF (x))F ∈F

where we set ξF (x) = ηF (x) = 0 if x 6∈ F . Since for ﬁxed x, y ∈ G, x, y ∈ F eventually,
we have

Moreover,

hξ(x), η(y)i = lim

U hξF (x), ηF (y)i = ϕ(y−1x),

x, y ∈ G.

x∈Gkξ(x)k ≤ k1/2,
sup

x∈Gkη(x)k ≤ k1/2,
sup

(3) =⇒ (4): Let ξ, η : G → H satisfy the conditions in (3). Let ξ′(x) = P ξ(x), where P
is the orthogonal projection on the closed linear span of

{η(x) | x ∈ G},

and put η′(y) = Qη(y), where Q is the orthogonal projection on the closed linear span of
{ξ′(x) | x ∈ G}. Then

ϕ(y−1x) = hξ′(x), η(y)i = hξ′(x), η′(y)i,

x, y ∈ H,

and both {ξ′(x)}x∈G and {η′(x)}x∈G are total sets in the Hilbert space H ′ = Q(H).
There is therefore no loss of generality to assume, that {ξ(x)}x∈G and {η(x)}x∈G are
total in H. Since ϕ is continuous, the map

(x, y) → hξ(x), η(y)i

is separately continuous, and by the uniform boundedness, and totality of {ξ(x)}x∈G and
{η(x)}x∈G, it follows that ξ, η : G → H are continuous from G to H with σ(H, H ∗)-
topology. Let {ξi(x)}i∈I and {ηi(x)}i∈I be the coordinates of ξ(x) and η(x) with respect
to a ﬁxed basis (ei)i∈I in H. Then ξi and ηi are continuous complex valued functions.
Moreover, for any open relative compact set U in G,

Xi∈IZU |ξi(x)|2 dx ≤ZU kξ(x)k2 dx < ∞.

By the continuity of ξi and the fact, that no non-empty open set has Haar measure zero,
it follows that all except countably many of the ξi’s vanish on the set U , i.e. {ξi}i∈I is
locally countable, and similarly, {ηi}i∈I is locally countable.
(4) =⇒ (1): For f ∈ L∞(G), we let m(f ) denote the multiplication operator g 7→ f g on
L2(G). For x ∈ G
where γx(f )(y) = f (x−1y). Put now,

qηi(y)(γx(qξi)(y)) =Xi∈I
Xi∈I

ηi(y−1)ξi(y−1x) = hξ(y−1x), η(y−1)i = ϕ(y(y−1x)) = ϕ(x).

Hence Φ(λ(x)) = ϕ(x)λ(x). This implies that

Corollary 3.3 ([BF84] and [Her74]). Let Gd be the group G with discrete topology. Then

and the M0A-norms on the two spaces coincide.

M0A(G) = M0A(Gd) ∩ C(G),

(cid:3)

Proof. Immediate from (1) ⇐⇒ (2).
Remark 3.4. It is not hard to see that the functions ξ, η : G → H in (3) of Theorem 3.2
can actually be chosen to be continuous:
From the proof of (3) =⇒ (4) it follows that ξ, η can be chosen such that they are contin-
uous from G to H with respect to the σ(H, H ∗)-topology on H, and such that for every
open relative compact set U ⊆ G, ξ(U ) and η(U ) are contained in a separable subspace of
H. This implies that ξ, η ∈ L∞(G, H). Let now f ∈ Cc(G) with kfk2 = 1, and deﬁne

(cid:3)

by

bξ(x),bη(x) ∈ L2(G, H)
bξ(x)(z) = f (z)ξ(zx)
bη(x)(z) = f (z)η(zx)

for all x ∈ G

z ∈ G,
z ∈ G.

Finally, using the fact that the group of right translations (Rx)x∈G deﬁned by

(Rxh)(z) = ∆1/2

G (x)h(zx),

h ∈ L2(G, H)

acts norm-continuously on L2(G, H), it is not not hard to check that x 7→ bξ(x) and y 7→
bη(y) are norm continuous from G to L2(G, H).
