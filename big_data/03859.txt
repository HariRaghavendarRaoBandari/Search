ABSTRACT

There are 15 cataclysmic variables (CVs) observed in the ﬁrst two campaigns
of the K2 mission. In this paper, the eight CVs showing distinct features are an-
alyzed in detail. Among these eight, modulations during quiescence are evident
at the known orbital periods in the SU UMa stars QZ Vir and RZ Leo, and at
our newly determined orbital periods of 1RXS J0632+2536 and WD 1144+011.
The periodogram analysis for the quiescent light curve of QZ Vir reveals multi-
period modulations and the coexistence of orbital and superhump periods. The
phased orbital light curves for the other 3 CVs in quiescence display wide (about
half cycle) and shallow (< 0.5 mag) eclipse features. Besides these modulations,
their quiescent light curves reveal several transient events: a sudden decrease of
system light in 1RXS J0632+2536, a low level ﬂare-like event in QZ Vir, a short
brightening event in RZ Leo and a temporary disappearance of the orbital mod-
ulation in WD 1144+011. The two known dwarf novae UV Gem and TW Vir and
the CVs USNO-B1.01144-00115322 and CSS130516:111236.7+002807 show out-
bursts, including 1 complete and 3 incomplete normal outbursts and 2 complete
superoutbursts. An incomplete but typical normal outburst conﬁrms the dwarf

nova identiﬁcation of the USNO-B1.01144-00115322. The one complete normal
outburst in UV Gem possibly provides the orbital period, since its modulations
are shorter than the previously observed superhump period. The superoutbursts
of TW Vir and CSS130516:111236.7+002807, along with their corresponding su-
perhump periods, indicate that both objects are SU UMa stars. The derived
superhump period of CSS130516:111236.7+002807 is 1.44 hr, implying that this
new SU UMa star is close to the period minimum.

Introduction

Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are interacting close binary systems consisting of a white
dwarf primary and a Roche-lobe ﬁlling low-mass companion in a tight orbit with a period
of ∼ 80 min - 10 hr. Some subsets of CVs with weak magnetic ﬁelds of the white dwarfs
(B < 106 G), are classiﬁed as non-magnetic CVs including novalikes (NL), dwarf novae (DN),
classic novae (CN) and recurrent novae (RN). In these systems, the material transferred from
the secondary spreads into an accretion disk surrounding the primary due to the viscous
processes between the adjacent accretion annulus (e.g.
friction and shear). The viscosity
within the accretion disk gives rise to the outward angular momentum migration and inward
material ﬂow through the disk releasing gravitational potential energy (cf. Cannizzo et al.
1988; Warner 2003; Frank et al. 2002). The disk is typically the brightest component in a non-
magnetic CV system and dominates most of the observed features, such as quasi-periodic DN
outbursts of ∼ 4 - 9 mag and the nearly constant system light of the NL subtype. Although
there are some discussions about the relationship between the accretion disk and a nova
outburst caused by a thermonuclear runaway (e.g. Retter & Leibowitz 1998; Lipunova &
Shakura 2002), the accretion disk in a DN system is a dominant light source in optical, UV
and X-ray bands and plays a key role in DN normal outbursts and superoutbursts (outbursts
in short orbital period systems which are brighter and last longer than normal outbursts).
Comprehensive reviews of DN outbursts in disk systems are given in Osaki (1996) and
Patterson et al. (2005).

During the four-year NASA Kepler mission from 2009 March to 2013 May (Borucki et
al. 2010; Haas et al. 2010), 15 of the 27 CVs located in the Kepler ﬁeld were monitored
successfully with results currently published for 8 (e.g. Howell et al. 2013; Scaringi et al.
2013a,b). Since the orbital periods of most CVs are ∼ 1.5 - 4 hrs, the current all-sky surveys
(e.g. CRTS, ASAS and PanSTARRS) with the cadence of ∼ 1 - 2 obs/24 hrs at best can

– 3 –

only provide information on outbursts but little on orbital variability during quiescence and
outburst. Therefore, Kepler holds an enormous potential for stringent tests of accretion
disk dynamics and precession at quiescence and outburst thanks to the unprecedented light
curves with nearly continuous photometric coverage (e.g. Wood et al. 2011; Cannizzo et al.
2012; Smak 2013; Osaki & Kato 2013, 2014). Despite the end of the Kepler prime mission
due to the loss of two of the spacecraft’s reaction wheels, the K2 mission (Howell et al. 2014),
as a new ecliptic-plane mission with continuous high-precision data (∼ 50 ppm from 6.5-hrs
S/N for a 12th mag G star, close to the sensitivity of the primary mission) over an 80 day
period for each campaign ﬁeld, continues Kepler’s ground-breaking discoveries on CVs. In
particular, the short-cadence observations in the K2 mission extend the studies of sporadic
variability and the changes in the disk and stream impact area (i.e., hot spot) during normal
outbursts and superoutbursts.

In this paper, we report on the 15 CVs, of which 6 and 9 are in the K2 Campaign 0
(K2-C0) and Campaign 1 (K2-C1) ﬁelds, respectively. These targets include 8 known DN,
one possible intermediate polar (IP), one new DN candidate, one peculiar CV and 4 unknown
type CVs from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS).

2. K2 Observations and Data Reductions

The RK catalogue (Version 7.21 released by Ritter & Kolb (2003b)), the Downes web
catalogue (i.e., cvcat), the CRTS database (Drake et al. 2009), the SDSS database (Szkody
et al. 2011) and SIMBAD were used to search all known CVs which likely fall within the
ﬁelds of view of K2-C0 and K2-C1 by using the code K2fov developed by the Kepler team.
There are 12 and 10 known CVs found in our proposals of C0 and C1, respectively, with
6 targets in C0 and 9 in C1 actually observed. Table 1 lists these 15 CVs. Although each
campaign of the K2 mission is originally designed for a period of over 80 days, the available
data provided by C0 only cover ∼ 35 days on average, since the Kepler spacecraft was not in
ﬁne point during the beginning part of C0, which was just an engineering test operated from
March 12 to May 27, 2014. The following C1 as the ﬁrst full length observing campaign
from May 30 to August 20, 2014, provided long cadence (LC; 30 min) observations for all
objects as well as short cadence (SC; 1 min) observations for the three DN: QZ Vir, TW Vir
and RZ Leo. There is a 3-day data gap in C1 between BJD 2456848 and BJD 2456851.

2.1. Light Curve Extractions

The Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) provides Target Pixel Files (TPF)
stored under the sole Ecliptic Plane Input Catalogue (EPIC) identiﬁcation number (see Ta-
ble 1). All 15 CV light curves were extracted from the original TPFs in C0 (data release 2)
and C1 (data release 3) by using the program PyKE, which was developed by the Guest Ob-
server Oﬃce (Still & Barclay 2012). The four pipeline tasks of PyKE: kepmask, kepextract,
kepdraw and kepconvert were used to reduce the TPFs.

The masks for the targets in a chosen frame with the brightest target were ﬁrst deﬁned
manually, then the background was automatically subtracted from the TPF in the kepextract
task. Finally, the tasks of kepdraw and kepconvert were used to plot the extracted light curve
and convert the data from FITS to ASCII. The original light curve plotted from the original
ASCII data ﬁle was separated into several small parts to remove cosmic rays by ﬁltering with
a simple median ﬁlter. The converted and clariﬁed ASCII data ﬁle has the three columns,
i.e., Barycentric Julian Day (BJD), Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP) ﬂux and the ﬂux
error. Note that SAP ﬂux is expressed in electrons per second.

2.2. Magnitude Conversion

By convention, the transformation from the SAP ﬂux fkep to the K2 magnitude Kp2 can

be approximated by the same formula used in the primary Kepler mission, i.e.,

fkep

1.74 × 105 = 10−0.4(Kp2−12)

(1)

During this transformation, we removed most of the single data points with obviously large
scatter.
In order to further verify this transformation, a simple comparison between the
results from the PyKE and IRAF1 was carried out. The task kepimages in PyKE was used
to separate the TPF ﬁles into a series of time-series FITS images. Then, they were measured
by using QPHOT in the aperture photometry package of IRAF. The ﬁnal comparison indicate
that there is only a small systemic diﬀerence between the two light curves. On the other hand,
Vanderburg & Johnson (2014) and Vanderburg (2014) have proposed a ’self-ﬂat-ﬁelding’
(SFF) method to remove the eﬀect of K2’s trends. They deﬁned a parameter of improvement
percentage to describe their K2 light curves reduced by using the SFF method. All the SFF

1IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility) is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is
operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, under cooperative agreement with the National Science
Foundation.

– 5 –

corrected light curves are available to the community online at their own website. However,
the SFF method does not always work well for the CVs. Table 1 lists the improvement
percentages given by Vanderburg & Johnson (2014) and Vanderburg (2014), which are made
by the SFF correction for all 15 CVs, of which 11 are less than 50%, and 3 are negative. This
means that the SFF method failed for three systems CSS130516:111236.7+002807 (hereafter
CSS1112+0028), SDSS J113826.72+061919.5 (hereafter J1138+0619) and RZ Leo. Since
QZ Vir, TW Vir and RZ Leo were observed in short cadence mode which provides more
information than their simultaneous LC data, we only discuss the SC light curves for these
three CVs.

2.3. Subtraction of Pseudo Periodic Signals

There were two signiﬁcant periodicities in all K2 observations. The ﬁrst is a 6-hr periodic
correction for the drift in the satellite pointing due to the loss of two reaction wheels. The
second is a period at 48 hrs due to thruster ﬁrings to remove momentum. This periodicity is
only seen clearly in the three original light curves in short cadence plotted from the direct
output data ﬁles of the PyKE, which show a nearly strict period of 3.9256 day (Dai et al.
2015). Note that this period is the second harmonic of the period 48 hr due to the plausible
two models of thruster ﬁring event. Both eﬀects are common in the K2 ﬁeld (e.g. Dai et al.
2015; Hakala et al. 2015; Kraus et al. 2015). The pseudo periodic signals resulting from the
jitter of the spacecraft in all of the extracted K2 light curves must be removed or minimized
during the K2 data reduction. After several experiments, we found that the best mask
covering 9 pixels can almost mitigate the impact of the 6-hr jitter of the target positions on
the CCD, since the peak at the period of ∼ 6 hr completely disappeared in the periodograms
of our deduced K2 data for all CVs discussed in this paper. Considering that the 48-hr
pseudo periodic signal is a series of distinctly separated dips, it was easy to manually remove
them from the three SC light curves in the following analysis.

3. Results and Discussion

The EPIC identiﬁcations for the targets in the K2 mission are listed in Table 1 along with
the discovery name or standard variable star designation if available. Of the 15 CVs observed
in K2-C0 and K2-C1, seven targets marked in Table 1 only show relatively featureless light
curves in LC since they were very faint during the K2 observations. Hence, they will not be
discussed. The basic parameters of the remaining eight CVs are listed in Table 2. Table 3
lists four transient events that were detected in the quiescent CVs with diﬀerent subtypes.

– 6 –

Since these events all have diﬀerent proﬁles, durations, amplitudes and occurred at diﬀerent
times in the light curves of each campaign, they are likely not due to the data reduction
process. While their origin is not clear as they are singular events in each case, it is likely
that they are related to slight changes in accretion rates. Figure 1 shows the 3 CVs with
normal outbursts observed in K2-C0. Figures 2 and 3 display the 5 CVs in quiescence and
2 CVs with superoutbursts.

3.1. CVs in quiescence

3.1.1. EPIC 202061317 = 1RXS J0632+2536 = SDSS J063213.1+253623

This CV was named 1RXS J0632+2536 (hereafter J0632+2536) in SIMBAD. Ritter &
Kolb (2003b) and Watson et al. (2015) have classiﬁed this target as a DN with an unﬁl-
tered magnitude range of 12.4 - 15.3 in the updated catalogue of cataclysmic binaries and
the AAVSO International Variable Star Index (VSX), respectively, based on the reports from
the vsnet-alert archives (e.g. de Miguel et al. 2012a,b). It is also listed in several other cata-
logues in the infrared, optical, UV and X-ray bands, such as the 2MASS all-sky catalogue of
point sources (Cutri et al. 2003), WISE All-Sky Data Release (Cutri et al. 2012, 2014), the
USNO-A2.0 and B1.0 catalogues (Monet 1998; Monet et al. 2003), the SDSS DR7 (Adelman-
McCarthy et al. 2009), the GALEX-DR5 (GR5) sources from AIS and MIS (Bianchi et al.
2012), and the ROSAT All-Sky Survey Faint Source Catalog (Voges et al. 2000). Despite
these detections, it is still a poorly studied CV. GALEX measurements of FUV=18.42±0.05
mags, NUV=17.90±0.03 mags and the ROSAT X-ray count rate of 0.02 cts/s are typical for
CVs. Several DN outbursts in March 2009 and January 2012 are reported in the literature
(e.g. Korotkiy & Sokolovsky 2012; Masi 2012; Ohshima 2012a) and are the basis for its clas-
siﬁcation as a dwarf nova. The two discovery images obtained by a small telescope (13.5 cm)
in Ka-Dar Observatory located at the Mountain station of Kazan State University show
obvious position deviation from the other observations (Korotkiy & Sokolovsky 2012). Both
discrepant observations may be caused by their underestimated errors. All K2 measurements
are of the brighter source in the DSS ﬁnding chart.

Considering that the SFF corrected light curve has only a negligible improvement of
3.6% for this target, we only analyzed our reduced K2 light curve which is shown in the
top panel of Figure 1. Besides a long-term periodic variation clearly seen in the zoomed
light curve, there is a sharp decrease of system light occurring around BJD 2456790 with
an amplitude of ∼ 0.25 mag. After the normalization by removing the systematic variations
from the original K2 light curve, a periodogram analysis clearly indicates two signiﬁcant
peaks at the period of 0.1621 day (3.89 hr) and 0.3240 day (7.78 hr). The method of phase

– 7 –

dispersion minimization (PDM; (Stellingwerf 1978)), conﬁrms the result of the periodogram.
The top plot in Figure 4 shows that the period of 3.89 hr has more power than that of
7.78 hr. However, the phased light curve of the 35-day K2 data folded on the 7.78 hr period,
shown in the top panel of Figure 5, proves that this period is the correct one, showing two
distinct peaks and dips during the orbit. A photometric period of ∼ 0.32521 day (7.81 hr)
was observed during a previous photometric campaign launched by the VSNET during an
outburst that occurred in 2012 late January to early February (e.g. de Miguel et al. 2012a,b;
Dubovsky et al. 2012; Dubovsky 2012b). The period of 3.89 hr was also detected in the
vsnet-alert report proposed by Kato (2012) while other VSNET reports during the decline
from outburst claim that it was variable (Ohshima 2012b,c). The 35-day K2 data clearly
demonstrate the stability of the period of 7.78 hr. It is very likely that this is the orbital
period of the system and the longer period of 7.81 hrs was a superhump period.

Several spectra were obtained over a timespan of one hour on 2015 February using
the MODS spectrograph (Pogge et al. 2010) on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The
spectra cover 3400 - 7400 ˚A using 2 gratings with a resolution of about 2000. The summed
spectra are shown in Figure 6 while the red spectra at the beginning and end of the timespan
are shown in Figure 7. These spectra show many absorption features yielding an approx-
imate spectral type of K5V, which is consistent with a long orbital period system. The
strong doubled nature of the Balmer emission lines indicates a peak-to-peak separation of
∼ 620 km/s. During the hour timespan, the doubled lines changed to a single feature, as is
typically viewed in DN as a disk structure such as a hot spot moves through the emission
lines.

Ohshima (2012a) ﬁrst regarded that the dips in the light curve are caused by eclipse,
but the wide widths (about half an orbital cycle) and shallow depths (0.3 mag and 0.1 mag)
are not consistent with eclipses. The light curve is similar to that of the long period (7.3 hr)
system TT Crt (Szkody et al. 1992), where the modulations can be explained by ellipsoidal
variations due to the K secondary if the mass ratio Mwd/Msec is > 1 and the inclination
is close to eclipsing (∼ 50 - 65 degree). The stream ﬂow over the disk for the high mass
transfer rates expected for long period systems can create hot spots that contribute to the
large amplitude of the ellipsoidal variation. However, it is surprising that the maximum
brightness comes after the deepest minimum, whereas a hot spot is normally expected prior
to the deep minimum. Spectroscopy throughout the orbit can provide conﬁrmation of the
correct scenario.

3.1.2. QZ Vir

This is a well-known SU UMa type DN (former name of T Leo) with the explicit
detection of several superoutbursts and their corresponding superhumps (e.g. Lemm et al.
1993; Kunjaya et al. 1994; Kato 1997; Patterson et al. 2005; Kato et al. 2009). Shafter
& Szkody (1984) and Kato et al. (2009) obtained its orbital and superhump periods of
0.05882 day (1.41 hr) and 0.0604 day (1.45 hr), respectively. There are also other proposed
identiﬁcations as a WZ Sge type star (Howell et al. 1999) or Intermediate Polar (IP). The
latter identiﬁcation was suggested by Shafter & Szkody (1984) and Vrielmann et al. (2004)
because of a 414 sec period observed in the XMM-Newton X-ray light curve that could be
the spin period of the white dwarf. Wenzel (1983) derived a mean cycle length of 420 day
for its superoutbursts based on four early eruptions reported in the literature. There are
ﬁve known superoutbursts in 1993, 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2009 observed in the optical band
(Kato et al. 2009), and one superoutburst in 1988 observed in the UV band (Hamilton &
Sion 2004). Compared with other typical WZ Sge type stars, the supercycle of QZ Vir is
shorter, and more coherent.

During the 80-day K2-C1 observations in short cadence, there was no outburst event,
but a secular decline with an amplitude of ∼ 1 mag. AAVSO data show that a superoutburst
began May 13 and lasted until about June 18 (about 16 days after the start of the K2-C1
observations). So, the decline is consistent with the end of the superoutburst. Quadratic and
linear functions were used to normalize the original K2 light curve before and after the data
gap of K2-C1, respectively. The normalized light curve is shown in Figure 2. Considering
the long-cadence SFF corrected light curve had an improvement percentage of less than
10%, the following discussions are based on our deduced light curve in short cadence, which
shows quasi-periodic modulations with a mean amplitude of ∼ 0.6 mag. Note that this
amplitude can occasionally reach up to over 1 mag. Moreover, a special ﬂare-like transient
with a duration of ∼ 8 day and an amplitude of ∼ 0.8 mag marked by the dash rectangles
in Figure 2 occurs around BJD 2456878. The zoomed light curve of this transient shown in
the top panel of Figure 8 further reveals that this event is also surrounded by other low-
level modulations. Although the periodicity of this modulation cannot be visibly seen as
in J0632+2536, the DFT result plotted in the second panel of Figure 4 using the program
Period04 deﬁnitely indicates two signiﬁcant peaks at the close periods of 0.0588 day (1.41 hr)
and 0.0597 day (1.43 hr), which are nearly consistent with the previously derived orbital and
superhump periods, respectively. The other peak at the period of 0.0294 day (0.71 hr) shown
in this periodogram is the harmonic of the orbital period. In addition, we found that a group
of peaks at the central period of 7.92 hr may be related to the pseudo 6-hr period.

Since the decline at the beginning of the K2-C1 light curve is the end of a superoutburst,

– 9 –

the fact that the detected period of 1.43 hr derived from the whole K2 dataset is a little less
than that obtained in the literature can be reasonably explained by the transition from
the long superhump period to the short orbital period after the superoutburst. Since the
data gap basically separates this K2 light curve into the decline and quiescent parts, the
two periodograms for the two parts of light curves shown in the top two panels of Figure 9
further verify that the decline is the end of the superoutburst. The top panel indicates that
the decay part of the superoutburst only shows the superhump period. The middle panel
illustrates that the highest peak has been shifted from the superhump to the orbital period in
quiescence. Besides these two periods, the quiescent light curve also includes many unknown
periods (sum of these periods may be beat periods), which result in the complicated and
irregular variations. Thus, we cannot obtain the distinct orbital and superhump modulations.
Note that the peak at the superhump period does not disappear or become very weak in
this plot. This may imply that the superhump period of 1.43 hr in QZ Vir is permanent
and coexists with the orbital period. Although many periods were detected in quiescence,
we cannot detect the spin period of the white dwarf at 414 sec and its harmonics, as found
by Vrielmann et al. (2004). The shortest period with a considerably weak power is 18.6 min.
Additionally, the periodogram for the ﬂare-like transient shown in the (c) panel of Figure 9
reveals a curious feature in that both orbital and superhump periods nearly vanished, but the
higher harmonic of the orbital period is signiﬁcant. Furthermore, there is another notable
peak at a new period of 2.67 hr, which is not displayed in the other two panels.

3.1.3. RZ Leo

Wolf (1919) ﬁrst classiﬁed RZ Leo as a possible nova in 1918 with a maximum at
10.5 mag. But, the second outburst in 1984 and the strong double-peaked emission lines
suggest that RZ Leo should be a member of WZ Sge-type stars (Mateo et al. 1985; Cristiani
et al. 1985). Then, Green (1985), Howell & Szkody (1988) and Ishioka et al. (2001) further
proposed that RZ Leo should be a SU UMa star due to the detection of superoutbursts lasting
14 days and corresponding superhumps with a period of 0.07616(21) - 0.0806(2) day and an
amplitude of ∼ 0.15 - 0.2 mag. The secondary of RZ Leo is regarded as a normal red dwarf
instead of a brown dwarf as implied by the typical WZ Sge stars (Mennickent et al. 1999;
Ishioka et al. 2001). In the literature, there were 7 recorded outbursts in 1918, 1935, 1952,
1976, 1984, 1989 and 2000 (see Ishioka et al. 2001, and references therein). Hence, Stubbings
(2000) estimated that the supercycle of RZ Leo is approximately ten years. In quiescence, the
photometric period of 0.0756(12) day derived by Mennickent et al. (1999) is a little smaller
than the spectroscopic period of 0.07651(26) day (Mennickent & Tappert 2001). Patterson
et al. (2003) obtained similar photometric and spectroscopic periods with higher precision,

– 10 –

which are 0.0760383(4) day and 0.0761(2) day, respectively. Both periods are smaller than
the derived superhump period of 0.07868(19) day (Kato et al. 2009; Patterson et al. 2003).

In K2-C1, RZ Leo is another one of three CVs observed in short cadence. The SFF
method failed to improve its K2 light curve due to the negative improvement percentage
listed in Table 1. The nearly ﬂat K2 light curve in short cadence shown in the middle panel
of Figure 2 never shows any long-term variation, but does have regular and low-amplitude
oscillations (∼ 0.5 mag on average) in quiescence. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram plotted
in the middle panel of Figure 4 indicates two notable periods of 0.03801 day (0.91 hr) and
0.07603 day (1.82 hr). This periodogram is similar to Figure 8 of Patterson et al. (2003).
Additionally, the PDM method also conﬁrmed this result. Hence, like J0632+2536, the
period of 0.07603 day with less power should be an authentic period, which agrees with the
previous result derived from the double-hump photometric light curves (Patterson et al.
2003). Furthermore, based on the 82-day K2-C1 data in short cadence, this period can be
improved by the O-C technique due to the high time resolution of the K2 data. Considering
that the irregular proﬁle of the second hump seriously distorts the two dips, the maximum
time of primary hump should be the best periodic signal for our O-C analysis. The ﬁrst
maximum time and the period obtained from the periodogram were set to be an initial
epoch and period, respectively. A primary ephemeris based on a time baseline over 1000
cycles can be used to rephase the short-cadence K2 data. However, when binning this phased
light curve with a phase resolution 0.001, there is a small zero-drift in phase ∼ 0.015 due to
the incorrect epoch. The new ephemeris after removing this zero-drift eﬀect was deduced as:

Tmax = BJD 2456808.23662(2) + 0.07602997(4) E,

(2)
with a variance of 7.4× 10−7 day. The precision of the period shown in Equation (2) is about
one order of magnitude higher than the period derived by Patterson et al. (2003). Figure
10 displays all the O-Cs of the maximum times of primary hump based on the ephemeris
Equation (2). By using the new derived period listed in Equation (2) to fold the linearly
normalized K2 light curve, we found that the phased light curve shows very large scatter,
∼ 0.43 mag on average. Compared with the phased light curve derived by Patterson et al.
(2003), our smooth binned light curve with higher phase resolution shown in the middle
panel of Figure 5 distinctly illustrates more details of the orbital light curve including a
round bottom at the primary dip and the round tops at the two peaks. A ﬂat bottom at the
second dip lasting phase 0.05 (∼ 5.5 min) is a consistent feature.

This phased light curve illustrates a brightening transient event with an amplitude of
∼ 0.6 mag, which is also displayed in the middle panel of Figure 8. Both plots clearly
demonstrate that this event takes place at BJD 2456845.1, which is coincident with the
original second hump. In the phased light curve, the top part of this transient event between

– 11 –

phase 0.3 and 0.9 obviously changes the normal second hump. The complete proﬁle of this
transient shown in the plot of time series indicates that its duration is ∼ 1.88 hr, which is
a little longer than the orbital period, and it is composed of a rapid rise with a rate of ∼
1.6 mag hr−1, a ﬂat peak with a rate of ∼ 0.05 mag hr−1 and a slow decline with a rate of ∼
0.5 mag hr−1. This event looks like a mini DN outburst with a faster and lower amplitude. In
addition, there is a weak rebrightening event occurring in the decay with a typical luminosity
level compared with the other primary peaks. This event is consistent with the ephemeris
of Equation (2). So it is a normal primary hump and is marked by a short vertical line in
the middle panel of Figure 8.

3.1.4. EPIC 201525706 = WD 1144+011 = SDSS J114633.93+005510.3

LBQS 1144+0111, an alias of this target, was ﬁrst observed in the Large, Bright QSO
Survey (LBQS, Foltz et al. (1987, 1989)), and classiﬁed as a DA+dMe binary, which is
composed of a DA type white dwarf and a normal M dwarf star with strong emission features
(Berg et al. 1992). Additionally, it was listed in a catalog of spectroscopically identiﬁed
white dwarfs in the ﬁrst data release of the SDSS (g=18.09 mag, Kleinman et al. (2004)).
Although Tappert et al. (2004) did not detect any variability in later time-series photometry,
it was claimed as a cataclysmic variable named WD 1144+011 in SIMBAD. However, its
optical spectrum obtained by Berg et al. (1992), shows many absorption lines and a low blue
continuum, which is atypical for a normal CV. Thus, its CV identiﬁcation is still doubtful.

The continuous K2 light curve in long cadence covering 80 days shows an orbital mod-
ulation but no outburst or transient event. There is a long-term rise of the system light
after the data gap of K2-C1. Therefore, we used linear and quadratic functions to normalize
the K2 light curves before and after the data gap, respectively. Note that a small transient
event marked by the dash rectangle in the bottom panel of Figure 2 appears at the end of
the K2 light curve around BJD 2456888. The zoomed light curve of this transient shown in
the bottom panel of Figure 8 illustrates that it is a short-timescale event lasting ∼ 0.5 day,
which involves a temporary disappearance of the orbital modulation. Since there is no notice
in the data release notes for K2-C1 nor any similar variation in the other CVs in K2-C1,
this appears to be a real feature of WD 1144+011. The orbital modulation with an average
amplitude of 0.03 mag reappears after this transient event. By using the Lomb-Scargle pe-
riodogram and PDM methods, a highly signiﬁcant period of 0.40859 day (9.806 hr) and its
harmonics are found based on the normalized data. Since the K2 light curve cannot be used
for a reliable O-C analysis like RZ Leo due to the sparse data points, we attempted to use a
sinusoidal function to ﬁt the normalized light curve according to the Levenberg-Marquardt

– 12 –

algorithm. The best least-square ﬁtting curve shown in Figure 11 can be deduced as follow,
− 2.524317(2)], (3)
Mnor = −9.9650(2)×10−4 +1.905555(2)×10−2 SIN [2π

TBJD

0.408680655(1)

where Mnor and TBJD are the normalized magnitude and the modiﬁed BJD (i.e., TBJD = BJD -
2456000), respectively. The best ﬁtting period of 0.408680655(1) day in Equation (3) basi-
cally accords with the primary period shown in the periodogram. Since the SFF improvement
percentage is 10.6%, we attempted to phase the SFF corrected light curve based on the pe-
riod in Equation (3) and obtained a nearly equal phase gap at a frequency of 20 cycle/day
(i.e., ∼ 19 min interval) shown in the (a) row of Figure 12. Although our normalized light
curve folded by the same period shown in the (c) row presents a similar gap, the zoomed-in
light curve in the right-side panel of the (c) row indicates that each section of the phased
light curve is smoother than that of the (a) row. In addition, by using the DFT method
(Period04 program), we obtained a new period of 0.408741 day (9.81 hr), which only has a
small diﬀerence 5.2 sec from the period listed in Equation (3). In spite of this small discrep-
ancy, the new phased SFF corrected light curve shown in the (b) row illustrates a distinctly
diﬀerent pattern of a sine-like modulation with a phased period of 0.02 day (i.e., ∼ 29.4 min)
superimposed on the original phased light curve without any gap. This modulation is totally
invisible in the new phased light curve for the normalized data, which only displays smooth
scatter. Note that the modulation period of 29.4 min presented in the (b) row is exactly the
same as the sampling rate of the K2 in LC and one 20th of the folding period of 9.81 hr.
Therefore, this sine-like modulation derived from the SFF corrected data is likely not real
since it could be removed after a simple normalization. The 19-min phase gaps shown in the
a) and c) rows may be caused by the inaccurate folding period. The binned phased light
curve shown in the bottom panel of Figure 5 has a slow rise and fast decline. The long period
and the light curve shape imply this system is likely a pre-CV with the modulation caused
by the changing view of the M star that is heated by the hot white dwarf. Time resolved
spectroscopy throughout the 9.81 hr period should show noticeable changes in the emission
lines.

3.2. CVs in outburst

3.2.1. EPIC 202061315 = USNO-B1.01144-00115322

This object named USNO-B1.01144-00115322 (hereafter USNO 01144) was ﬁrst listed
in the USNO-B1.0 catalogue (Monet et al. 2003). Kryachko et al. (2009) claimed that it
showed a DN outburst with a duration of > 7 day and an amplitude of > 4 mag as observed
at KSU Astrotel Observatory in November, 2009. Its optical spectra on 2009 November 19

– 13 –

obtained by Pejcha (2009) show broad Balmer absorption lines with a narrow emission core
and a weak Hα emission line in the blue and red wavelengths, respectively. In addition, the
continuum in the blue end is obviously stronger than that in the red end.

During the observations with K2-C0 in long cadence, a brightening event was detected
around BJD 2456770. Although the K2 light curve shown in Figure 1 was incomplete due
to missing the beginning part of the outburst, it was enough to conﬁrm that this is a
typical normal outburst with an outburst amplitude of ∼ 3.5 mag, which further supports
the previous classiﬁcation of DN. However, the SFF corrected light curve with the signiﬁcant
improvement percentage 209.6% never recorded this brightening event since the SFF data
just began from BJD 2456772.109, close to the end of this normal outburst. Based on the
systematic diﬀerence between our normalized SAP ﬂux and the SFF corrected data, the SFF
corrected light curve was replotted in the middle panel of Figure 1 with the same scale as
our deduced K2 light curve. We found that the large scatter with an amplitude of ∼ 1 mag
has been almost eliminated by the SFF method. Especially, the sudden introduced large
scatters at the end of the smooth decay of normal outburtst can be naturally explained by
its faint quiescence. The plot of the diﬀerences between the two light curves illustrate an
obvious deviation lasting ∼ 5 days at the end of the decay section, which is caused by the
very ﬂat SFF light curve. Considering that the diagram of the diﬀerences between the two
light curves in quiescence is basically ﬂat as shown in the middle panel of Figure 1, the
normal outburst with a smooth and consecutive proﬁle presented in our deduced K2 light
curve is authentic. Thus, a new and complete K2 light curve of this object can be composed
of our deduced part in outburst and the SFF corrected part in quiescence. A period search
based on this complete K2 light curve only gives the null result.

3.2.2. UV Gem

The three superoutbursts recorded in 2003, 2008 and 2011 accompanied with super-
humps deﬁnitely classify UV Gem as a SU UMa-type star with a long superhump period
(e.g. Kato & Makoto 2001; Kato et al. 2009). The O-C diagram of the superhumps derived
by Kato (2013) show a downward quadratic curve covering these three superoutbursts with
an extremely negative decline rate of -5.34×10−4 on the basis of the superhump period of
0.0936 day derived from the superoutburst in 2003. Kato & Makoto (2001) estimated that
the cycle length of the normal outbursts is ∼ 13.5 day, but there is not enough data to derive
the supercycle length (Otulakowska-Hypka & Olech 2013). Until now, only one quiescent
spectrum with a weak Hα emission line and typical continuum covering 4600 - 9000 ˚A was
obtained by Zwitter & Munari (1994). Thus, its orbital period is still unclear (Ritter & Kolb

– 14 –

2003b)

Fortunately, a complete normal outburst lasting 5 days with an amplitude of around
3 mag occurring around BJD 2456788 was detected in K2-C0. Considering that the SFF
method successfully improved the quiescent light curve of USNO 01144, the SFF corrected
light curve was checked but there was a very low improvement percentage 0.8% for UV Gem.
In order to clearly demonstrate the coherence of the two light curves, they are replotted into
the same frame and their almost ﬂat diﬀerences are shown in the bottom panel of Figure 1
except for a systematic shifting ∼ 0.1 mag from BJD 2456783 to BJD 2456794, which totally
covers the whole outburst. Like USNO 01144, the ﬂat diﬀerences imply that the normal
outburst detected in our deduced light curve is also real. In addition, the large scatter and
the quasi-periodic jitters at the peak and decay parts of the outburst light curve clearly
appeared in the SFF corrected light curve. The two Lomb-Scargle periodograms for our
deduced data and the SFF corrected data shown in the UV Gem (a) and (b) panels of
Figure 13 demonstrate that the known 6-hr pseudo periodic signal caused by the regular
thrusting event of the Kepler satellite is not eliminated in the SFF data, but is removed
from our deduced data. Additionally, the two signiﬁcant peaks at the period of 0.086089 day
( 2.07 hr) and 0.088342 day (2.12 hr), respectively, appeared in the UV Gem (a) panel of
Figure 13. Both periods are less than the orbital period of 0.0895 day (2.15 hr) listed in
the updated CVs catalog (RKcat 7.21, Ritter & Kolb (2003b)), that was estimated from
the superhump period of 0.0935 day (2.24 hr) using an empirical relation given by Stolz &
Schoembs (1984). Hence, the K2 data allow the ﬁrst determination of a plausible orbital
period for UV Gem. Moreover, there is still a weak but analogous frequency feature displayed
in the UV Gem (b) panel of Figure 13. Considering that this periodogram is similar to QZ
Vir, the longer 2.12 hr period with less power may be the remaining superhump period after
an unrecorded superoutburst. However, the phased light curve cannot be obtained due to
the sparse K2 data available in long cadence.

3.2.3. EPIC 210282487 = 1RXS J111236.7+002807 = CSS1112+0028 = SDSS 111236.7+002807

In SIMBAD, this target named 1RXS J111236.7+002807 is classiﬁed as an X-ray source
as it ﬁrst appeared in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey Faint Source Catalogue (Voges et al.
2000), and has a typical CV count rate of 0.02368. However, it was regarded as a galaxy
(g = 22.46 mag) in the SDSS DR 9 in spite of a position deviation of ∼ 14.8 arcsec compared
with the coordinates in SIMBAD. Recently, the CRTS classiﬁed this target as a CV due to
the detection of several transient variations with a nearly 4 mag amplitude (i.e., 17 - 21 mag)
in low time resolution data obtained during the last ten years (Drake et al. 2009). Hence,

– 15 –

the faint g-band magnitude listed in the SDSS catalog corresponds to quiescence during the
SDSS observations.

A typical superoutburst lasting 17 days with a weak precursor and an amplitude of
∼ 5.6 mag was detected in the long cadence K2-C1 data. The converted K2 magnitude is
consistent with the previous observations of the CRTS and the SDSS. Although the scatter
in the quiescent light curve is not apparent in the upper panel of Figure 3, it is obviously
present in the magnitude plot (i.e., the log graph) since quiescence may reach the detection
limit of the satellite. Considering that the SFF method only provides a negative improvement
percentage -19.5%, we cannot expect that the scatter in quiescence can be reduced by the SFF
method. In order to visually display the superhumps on the plateau of the superoutburst,
we used the dotted lines to connect the adjoining data points due to the low time resolution
in long cadence. The zoomed plots in SAP ﬂux and Kp2 are shown in the (a) and (b) panels
of Figure 14, respectively. Both diagrams further demonstrate that it is hard to reliably
detect the superhump from such sparse time series, which only has 4 - 5 data points in each
superhump cycle at most. In spite of this, we attempted to use a linear function to normalize
the plateau in magnitude, which can be described as follow,

Kp2 = −59.813(±0.499) + 0.088639(±0.000574) TBJD.

(4)

This can be converted into an exponential function for describing the plateau in SAP ﬂux
by using Equation (1). However, the normalized plateau in magnitude shown in the (c)
panel of Figure 14 shows a quasi-sinusoidal variation with an amplitude of ∼ 0.05 mag and
a period of ∼ 7.6 day except for the small deviation at the end of the plateau. After a
further normalization by subtracting this sine curve, a ﬂat plateau shown in the (d) panel of
Figure 14 was obtained. Based on this ﬁnal normalized data, a Lomb-Scargle periodogram
shown in the bottom panel of Figure 4 reveals two signiﬁcant peaks with comparable power
at 0.060137 day (1.44 hr) and 0.30068 day (0.72 hr). However, the PDM method cannot ﬁnd
any period from the same data. Considering that the minimum orbital period for hydrogen-
rich CVs is ∼ 70 min (Warner 2003), it is reasonable to conclude that the smaller period of
0.30068 day is only a harmonic, but the superhump period of this object is the other period
of 0.060137 day due to the lack of peaks at longer periods. This implies that this object is
a short-period SU UMa type star. Although the superhump period derived from this sparse
K2 data may be not very accurate, the K2 light curve in long cadence can deﬁnitely conﬁrm
the detection of a typical superoutburst and the corresponding superhump with a plausible
period of 1.44 hr. This means that CSS1112+0028 is a SU UMa type DN close to the period
minimum. Note that the known 6-hr pseudo period is also not visible in the periodogram.
Further followup observations in higher time resolution are necessary to precisely certify its
superhump and orbital periods.

– 16 –

3.2.4. TW Vir

This is a well-known UG Gem type DN since 1932 (O(cid:48)Connell 1932). Shafter (1983) ﬁrst
obtained its orbital period of 4.38 hr, the orbital inclination 43◦ and the mass ratio of 0.44.
Ak et al. (2002) claimed that there were 7872 observations including 62 normal outbursts
for TW Vir from 1955 to 1997. Based on these observations, they derived that the average
outburst duration and the quiescent interval of TW Vir should be 6 and 22 day by setting the
two reference lines at 12.2 and 13.5 mag. Besides this optical photometry, there were some
detailed UV and IR observations. It’s UV spectrum in outburst taken by the IUE shows a
P Cygnic proﬁle of the CIV 1550 line, which indicates a strong accretion disk wind (C´ordova
& Mason 1982; Hamilton et al. 2007). Szkody (1985) analyzed other IUE spectra when TW
Vir switched to quiescence, and found that the CIV line returned back to a normal emission
line with a larger equivalent width (145 ˚A) than the Balmer lines. Additionally, Mateo et al.
(1985) obtained a sinusoidal IR light curve with a period of 2.2 hr (i.e., one-half the orbital
period) and a half amplitude of 0.063 mag. They estimated that the secondary of TW Vir
is a M3V red dwarf of 0.4 M(cid:12).

Like QZ Vir and RZ Leo, TW Vir was observed in short cadence with K2-C1. The K2
light curve shown in the bottom panel of Figure 3 recorded two incomplete normal outbursts
and one completed superoutburst lasting 16 days with a typical precursor on the rise to
superoutburst. The amplitude of this superoutburst is ∼ 4.5 mag, which is 0.5 mag larger
than the following two normal outbursts. The quiescent interval between them is less than 26
days, which is consistent with the average result derived by Ak et al. (2002). The amplitude
and the duration of this superoutburst of TW Vir are 1.1 mag and 1 day shorter than those
of CSS1112+0028, respectively. Considering that the improvement percentage by the SFF
method is 16.9% for the light curve in long cadence, the SFF corrected data and our reduced
data were replotted in the same diagram like USNO 01144 and UV Gem. Inspection of the
bottom panel of Figure 3 indicates that the obvious deviations between the two light curves
are at the beginning of the time series including the plateau of the superoutburst, where the
SFF data present larger scatter. But, the remaining parts of the two light curves are similar.
The two panels illustrate that the SFF light curve undergoes an unexpected break-oﬀ point
near the end of the plateau. A periodogram for the plateau of the superoutburst based on
the SFF data is shown in the TW Vir (b) panel of Figure 13. A peak at the period of 6 hr
is the only signiﬁcant feature, and there is not any signal around the orbital period. For
comparison, the periodogram of our deduced data in the same data range shown in the TW
Vir (a) panel indicates that the plateau also seriously suﬀers from the eﬀect of the pseudo
6-hr period. But, there are some weak peaks around the orbital period of 4.38 hr.

4. Conclusion

The extracted light curves of the 15 CVs observed in the K2-C0 and K2-C1 ﬁelds reveal
interesting details. J0632+2536, QZ Vir, RZ Leo and SDSS J1146 were observed only in
quiescence while USNO 01144, UV Gem, CSS1112+0028 and TW Vir also show outburst
and/or superourtbursts. The major results from these light curves are listed below.

J0632+2536: A consistent period of 7.78 hr derived from the normalized data is likely
the orbital period, and the 7.81 hr period previously during outburst is likely the superhump
period. The phased light curve based on this period shows a regular orbital modulation
with two distinct humps and dips superimposed on a long-term variation of system light.
Based on the large width and shallow depth of the two dips, combined with our optical
spectra showing a prominent K5 star, we regard this object as a moderate inclination CV
with ellipsoidal variations in combination with one or more hot spots. A decrease of system
light with an amplitude of 0.25 mag and a duration of 2.5 day was detected during the latter
half of the K2-C0 light curve, likely indicating a change in accretion rate.

QZ Vir: The short cadence K2-C1 data demonstrate the coexistence of orbital and
superhump periods in quiescence, which are similar to those in the literature. A declining
light curve with an amplitude of ∼ 1 mag and a duration of ∼ 25 day before the data gap
of K2-C1 is connected to the decay of a superoutburst and only one signiﬁcant peak at the
superhump period appears in the periodogram. Additionally, a ﬂare-like transient event
in quiescence with an amplitude of ∼ 0.8 mag and a duration of ∼ 8 day was apparent and
surrounded by low-level modulations. During this transient event, the orbital and superhump
periods vanished, but the 0.71 hr harmonic of the orbital period and a new period of 2.67 hr
were apparent. Although the spin period of the white dwarf at 414 sec detected in X-ray and
its harmonics were not detected in the K2 light curve, multi-period variations were present.

RZ Leo: A new orbital ephemeris based on the 82-day K2-C1 data further conﬁrms the
period derived by Patterson et al. (2003). However, the phased light curve shows a large
average scatter of ∼ 0.43 mag. After binning into 0.001 bins and using our reﬁned ephemeris,
we obtained a smooth phased light curve, with primary and secondary minima. Additionally,
an unusual brightening event with an amplitude of ∼ 0.6 mag and a duration of ∼ 1.88 hr is
apparent in one orbit.

WD 1144+011: The K2 light curve in long cadence reveals a strong 5% modulation of
the light curve at a period of 9.81 hrs. The analysis is complicated by a beat between this
period and the LC sampling rate. It appears that this system is likely a pre-CV, with the
modulation resulting from the changing view of the M dwarf which is heated by the white
dwarf. The light curve shows a peculiar transient event lasting about a half day when the

– 18 –

regular modulation almost disappears.

USNO 01144: An incomplete normal outburst with a typical amplitude of ∼ 3.5 mag
was detected at the beginning of K2-C0. This event was totally missed by the start times
of the SFF corrected data. However, the SFF method greatly reduces the large scatter with
an amplitude of ∼ 1 mag during quiescence time. This outburst event detected by K2-C0
classiﬁes this target as a DN.

UV Gem: A complete and typical normal outburst with a duration of 5 day and an
amplitude of 3 mag was observed in K2-C0. The SFF corrected and our deduced light curves
are basically consistent. The two close periods of 0.086089 day and 0.088342 day shown in
the periodogram are likely the superhump and orbital periods.

CSS1112+0028: This is a faint CV with large scatter in quiescence. The K2-C1 light
curve in long cadence illustrates a typical superoutburst with an amplitude of ∼ 5.6 mag
and a duration of ∼ 17 day. After the linear normalization, the plateau of the superoutburst
shows a sine-like variation with a period of ∼ 7.6 day and an amplitude of ∼ 0.05 mag.
After removing this sine-like variation, the ﬁnal ﬂat normalized plateau clearly reveals a
superhump period 1.44 hr. This means that this target is a new SU UMa type star close to
the period minimum.

TW Vir: A superoutburst with a duration of ∼ 16 day and an amplitude of ∼ 4.5 mag
followed by two incomplete normal outbursts was detected by K2-C1 in short cadence. In
addition, the K2-C1 data indicates that the quiescent interval is close to 26 days.
