Abstract

We study D-instanton solutions in type IIB supergravity on AdS5 × T 1,1,
which has a dual N = 1 SU (N ) × SU (N ) super Yang-Mills theory. Apart
from ordinary D(-1)-brane instantons, we discuss wrapped D1-branes over
minimal 2-cycles and derive explicit solutions preserving half the supersym-
metries. These solutions are identiﬁed with Yang-Mills instantons which are
(anti)self-dual in both gauge group factors with instanton charge (k, k′). By
examining the boundary behaviour of the solutions we discuss the coupling to
the corresponding dual boundary operators, and identify their vacuum expec-
tation values. We also discuss the boundary terms and compute the action
for these solutions.

Introduction

AdS/CFT correspondence has provided us with a duality between type IIB string
theory on AdS5 × S 5 and N = 4 SYM theory in four dimensions [1]. Since the
duality relates weak coupling of one theory to the strong coupling of the other, to
examine it one needs some quantities to be computed nonperturbatively on both
sides of the correspondence. Instantons on the Yang-Mills side, and D-instantons
on the supergravity side, being exact solutions of the equations of motion, provide
a tool for this purpose.

The main reasons that allow us to identify instantons with D-instantons – and
also their corresponding contributions in gauge and string theory – are as follows.
First, both of these conﬁgurations are exact solutions of the equations of motion:
instantons being solutions of Yang-Mills equations on ﬂat space, and D-instantons
being solutions of supergravity equations in the background of AdS5 × S 5 supple-
mented with a 5-form ﬁeld strength. Second, the action attains its absolute minimum
for these conﬁgurations. And ﬁnally, they both preserve equal amount of supersym-
metries. These two last properties are especially important in arguing the stability
of such solutions when interpolating between weak and strong couplings.

In this note we look at the model put forth by Klebanov and Witten (KW)
aimed at providing AdS/CFT dualities with less supersymmetries [2]. The model is
concerned with the dynamics of N D3-branes at the tip of a conifold, which, in turn,
results in a duality between an N = 1 SU(N)× SU(N) superconformal ﬁeld theory
and type IIB string theory on AdS5×T 1,1, where T 1,1 is the base of the conifold. We
will be mainly interested in the supergravity equations of motion in this background,
which has the characteristic of having two moduli [2]. The ﬁrst moduli consists of
the constant dilaton and the axion, and the second one arises since the second betti
number of T 1,1 is one. Hence, one can take non-trivial B ﬁelds with vanishing ﬁeld
strengths. Generically, adding any extra D-branes to this set up would backreact on
the geometry, and thus one needs to solve the whole equations of motion from the
start. However, there exist supersymmetric D-instantons which have a zero energy
momentum tensor and thus the background remains the same as before adding the
D-instantons.

As in type IIB supergravity on AdS5 × S 5, one can consider D(-1)-branes in the
KW model which source the axion and dilaton ﬁelds in the bulk. However, since
T 1,1 admits a harmonic 2-form one can wrap (Euclidean) D1-branes, or F-strings,
around the dual cycle to get extra point charges in AdS5. Moreover, in this model
axion couples to the sum of the instanton densities in the corresponding two gauge
groups, whereas C2 (for which D1-brane is a source) couples to the diﬀerence of
these densities. Therefore, D(-1)-branes in the bulk (when C2 = 0) correspond to
instantons of charge (k, k) on the boundary,1 while D1-branes in the bulk correspond
to instantons of charge (k, k′) with k 6= k′. This shows that we need both D(-1)-
branes and D1-branes to get a complete set of supersymmetric instanton charges on

the boundary.

In the next section, ﬁrst we look at the supergravity ﬁeld equations and write
down a consistent ansatz to reduce them to some coupled scalar ﬁeld equations on
AdS5. In section 3, we look at the supersymmetry of the solutions and ﬁnd that they
preserve half the supersymmetries. In section 4, we solve the scalar ﬁeld equations
and ﬁnd explicit solutions. The solutions correspond to D(-1)-branes and D1-branes
smeared over T 1,1. Further, we study the behaviour of solutions near the boundary
of AdS5 which allows us to identify the vacuum expectation values (vev) of the dual
operators. In the last section, we write down the action in a dual description and
derive a lower bound which is saturated by the D-instanton solutions. We argue
that the bound is set by a boundary term which we then explicitly compute for the
solutions we have found.

2 The background and dual operators

D-instantons in AdS5 × S 5 background are characterized with a non-trivial proﬁle
of dilaton and axion. In fact, preserving supersymmetry requires

de−φ = ±idc ,

(1)

where φ and c are the dilaton and axion ﬁelds, respectively. Moreover, with this
ansatz D-instantons will have a zero contribution to the energy momentum tensor
such that there is no backreaction on the metric. The equation of motion for the
dilaton reduces to:

(2)
which then has an exact solution on AdS5 × S 5 background [3, 4]. In this article, we
would like to study D-instanton conﬁgurations in the Klebanov-Witten model [2].
The case of D(-1)-branes will be similar to what we have in AdS5 × S 5 background,
though, in the KW model axion at the boundary couples to

∇2eφ = 0 ,

Z tr (F1 ∧ F1 + F2 ∧ F2) ,

(3)

where F1 and F2 are the ﬁeld strengths taking value in the corresponding gauge
group SU(N) × SU(N).
To start, let us brieﬂy go through the KW model and see how the couplings to
the dual operators are arranged. The type IIB supergravity background that we are
concerned with is characterized by a metric on EAdS5 × T 1,1

L2

ds2 =

z2 (cid:16)dz2 + dxidxi(cid:17) + L2ds2

5 ,

where i = 1, . . . , 4, L4 = 4πgsN(α′)2, and

ds2

Xa=1

(4)

(5)

which is the metric on T 1,1 = (SU(2)× SU(2))/U(1) ∼ S 2 × S 3. The ﬁve form ﬁeld
strength reads
(6)

F5 = 4L4(cid:16)vol(AdS5) + vol(T 1,1)(cid:17) .

The dilaton and axion are constant, whereas B = b ω2 with a constant b, and ω2 a
harmonic 2-form proportional to the volume of S 2 in T 1,1:

ω2 =

1
√2

(sin θ1dθ1 ∧ dφ1 − sin θ2dθ2 ∧ dφ2) ,

so that

and

dω2 = d ∗5 ω2 = 0 ,

ω2 ∧ ∗5ω2 = vol(T 1,1) .

(9)

As argued in [2], we identify the couplings and the theta angles of the gauge

theory with the boundary values of the supergravity ﬁelds as follows

(10)

where n is an integer, and 1 and 2 subindices refer to the two SU(N) gauge factors.
Therefore, to identify the topological charges of the supergravity D-instantons, it is
useful to rearrange the instanton numbers as follows:

θ1Z tr (F1 ∧ F1) + θ2Z tr (F2 ∧ F2) =
(θ1 + θ2)Z tr (F1 ∧ F1 + F2 ∧ F2) +

1
2

1
2

(θ1 − θ2)Z tr (F1 ∧ F1 − F2 ∧ F2) ,

so comparing with (10), we see that if we turn on a non-trivial c ﬁeld in the bulk
its boundary value acts as a source for the ﬁrst term, while the second term couples
to the boundary value of C2 ﬁeld. Note, in particular that if C2 = 0 then, as we
will argue in Sec. 3.3, the vev of the second operator vanishes and thus it would
correspond to instantons of (k, k) charge at the boundary. So we conclude that for
having instantons of (k, k′) charge (with k 6= k′) it is necessary to turn on D1-branes.

3 Smeared D-instantons

To start our discussion of solutions in the KW model, let us look at the type IIB
ﬁeld equations and see how by making suitable ansatz we can reduce them to scalar
ﬁeld equations in AdS5. Next, we consider the supersymmetry transformations and
ﬁnd that the ansatz solutions preserve half of the supersymmetries.

˜F5 ∧ ∗ ˜F5 + C4 ∧ H3 ∧ F3(cid:19) ,

where

and,

F3 = dC2 , F5 = dC4 , H3 = dB ,
˜F3 = F3 − cH3 ,

˜F5 = F5 − C2 ∧ H3 ,

∗ ˜F5 = ˜F5 .

The type IIB equations of motion derived from the above action read:

d ∗ (eφ ˜F3) = −H ∧ F5
d ∗ ˜F5 = H ∧ F3 .

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

Now, by examining the supersymmetry transformations and the energy momen-

tum tensor we are led to consider the following ansatz

de−φ = ±idc ,

˜F3 = ±ie−φH .

(15)

In fact, by looking at the energy momentum tensor

with µ, ν = 0, . . . , 10, we see that T inst
µν vanishes for the conﬁgurations which satisfy
(15). Therefore, if we ﬁnd D-instanton solutions with the above ansatz they will
have no backreaction on the background metric, and the Einstein equations are
satisﬁed in their presence.

Next, let us see how the ﬁeld equations are reduced by the above ansatz. For

deﬁniteness, however, we choose

˜F3 = −ie−φH ,

4

(16)

so that the equations of motion read

d ∗ dφ = e2φdc ∧ ∗dc − e−φH ∧ ∗H
d(e2φ ∗ dc) = iH ∧ ∗H
d ∗ (e−φH + icH) = F3 ∧ F5
d ∗ H = − iH ∧ F5
d ∗ ˜F5 = H ∧ F3 .

Now, set

H = dT ∧ ω2,

(17)

(18)

where T is a scalar function on AdS5, and ω2 the harmonic 2-form on T 1,1 as deﬁned
in (7). The third and fourth equations above imply that we must have

d(e−φ + ic) = 0 ,

whereas, the ﬁrst and the second equations collapse to
d(eφ ∗5 dφ) = −dT ∧ ∗5dT

together with

where the subindex 5 now refers to the AdS5 space.

d ∗5 dT = 0 ,

3.1 Supersymmetry

(19)

(20)

(21)

Before discussing the explicit D-instanton solutions, we would like to determine
whether the solutions satisfying ansatz (15) preserve any supersymmetry. For D(-1)-
branes it is known that they preserve half of the supersymmetries of the background.
To ﬁnd a bosonic supersymmetric background the fermionic ﬁelds are set to
zero, then for consistency the supersymmetry variations of these ﬁelds must vanish
too. Hence, in type IIB supergravity we need to check the supersymmetry trans-
formations of dilatino and gravitino [5]. In Euclidean space, for the supersymmetry
variation of dilatino we have

(24)

Note that in Euclidean space the spinors and their complex conjugates are in diﬀer-
ent representations and thus are treated as independent ﬁelds (parameters).

Now for the background to be supersymmetric we choose ε∗ = 0. Setting the

dilatino variation to zero implies

∂µ¯τ = 0 ,

Γµνρǫ Gµνρ = 0 ,

(28)

The ansatz in the previous section, (16) and (19), already satisfy the following
equations

∂µ¯τ = 0 ,

¯Gµνρ = 0 ,

so that the ﬁrst equation of (25) and eq. (27) are satisﬁed. Therefore, for being
supersymmetric, we further need to check the second equation of (25), i.e.,

Γµνρε Gµνρ = 0 .

(29)

To show this, we use the following vielbein basis for the metric on T 1,1:

R3131 = R3ˆ13ˆ1 = R3232 = R3ˆ23ˆ2 = R1ˆ2ˆ12 = R12ˆ2ˆ1 = 1 ,

R1ˆ11ˆ1 = R2ˆ22ˆ2 = 3

from which the non-vanishing components of the Weyl tensor can be derived

C 1ˆ1ˆ22 = C 1ˆ11ˆ1 = C 2ˆ22ˆ2 = 2
C 1ˆ21ˆ2 = C
ˆ12ˆ12 = C 1212 = C

ˆ1ˆ2ˆ1ˆ2 = C 1ˆ22ˆ1 = C 12ˆ1ˆ2 = −1 .

percharges determined by the integrability condition along T 1,1:2

where η indicates a constant spinor on T 1,1. For a = 1, b = ˆ1, this implies

C abcdγcd η = 0 ,

(36)

(37)

where we have used the ansatz (16), (18), and the last line follows because of (36).
At the end, there remains to check eq. (26). However, this equation is the same that
appears when we have only D(-1)-branes, which are known to be half supersymmet-
ric. So we conclude that our D-instanton solutions preserve 1/2 supersymmetries.

3.2 Solutions

Let us now turn to solving the last two equations in Sec. 3. Eq. (21), with a delta
function singularity on the right hand side (here the location of D-instanton) in fact
deﬁnes the Green function of massless scalars in AdS5. The general case of mas-
sive scalar propagators have been discussed and derived in terms of hypergeometric
functions in [6, 7]. However, for massless scalars, the solutions are easier to ﬁnd.

To begin with, let us write eq. (21) in the Poincare coordinates, (4), and set

L = 1 for convenience

(38)

(39)

This equation can be conveniently solved by ﬁrst deﬁning

z3∂z(cid:18) 1

z3 ∂zT(cid:19) + ∂i∂iT = 0 .

ξ =

z2 + z2

2zz1

1 + (~x − ~x1)2 ,

in terms of which the geodesic distance is usually expressed. If we write eq. (38) in
terms of ξ, it reduces to an ordinary diﬀerential equation in variable ξ:

4ξ 2(1 − ξ 2)T ′′(ξ 2) − 2(2 + 3ξ 2)T ′(ξ 2) = 0 .

(40)

2For the Gamma matrices we take Γn = σ1 ⊗ ˆγ n ⊗ 1, for n = 1, . . . , 5, and Γa = σ2 ⊗ 1 ⊗ γ a,
for a = 6, . . . , 10, with ε =(cid:18) 1

0 (cid:19) ⊗ ǫ ⊗ η.

7

The solution is the D1-branes instanton (smeared along T 1,1) in AdS5 space

T (ξ 2) = a1 + b1  3ξ 2 − 2

(1 − ξ 2)3/2! ,

(41)

which has a delta function singularity at ξ 2 = 1, the location of the D-instanton

z = z1 ,

~x = ~x1 .

(42)

a1 and b1 are two constant parameters and the boundary value of T , when z → 0,
is T0 = a1 − 2b1.
Now, let us discuss dilaton equation (20). Substituting solution (41) for T on
the right hand side of (20), it reduces to

4ξ 2(1 − ξ 2)(eφ)′′ − 2(2 + 3ξ 2)(eφ)′ +

9b2

(1 − ξ 2)4 = 0 ,

where again prime indicates the derivative with respect to ξ 2. This equation can be
integrated to get the particular solution

eφ
s = −

b2
1 (3ξ 2 − 2)2
2(1 − ξ 2)3

(44)

To this we can add the solution of the homogeneous equation to get the general
solution for the dilaton:

eφ = a0 + b0   3 ˜ξ 2 − 2

(1 − ˜ξ 2)3/2! −

1 (3ξ 2 − 2)2
b2

where, to keep track of the diﬀerent moduli, the solution of the homogeneous equa-
tion is now written in terms of

˜ξ =

Here, a0 and b0 are two constant parameters so that eφ → eφ0 = a0 − 2b0 − 2b2
the boundary.

3.3 Near boundary behaviour

Having a scalar ﬁeld of mass m in AdSd+1, we can examine its boundary behaviour.
According to the AdS/CFT correspondence [8], the boundary value of the scalar
ﬁeld acts as a source for the dual operator of dimension ∆

∆ =

1
2

(d + √d2 + 4m2) .

8

(47)

Furthermore, the subleading term in fact determines the vacuum expectation value
of the dual operator [9, 10]. More explicitly, near the boundary we have

φ(z, ~x) ∼ zd−∆ φ0(~x) + z∆ φ1(~x) ,

(48)

so that φ0(~x) acts as a source of the dual operator, while φ1(~x) determines its
expectation value.

The scalar ﬁelds we are concerned with have zero masses, and we discussed the
dual operators in Sec. 2. Now that we have explicit exact solutions of these scalars
we can look at the boundary behaviour and read oﬀ the vacuum expectation values
of the dual operators. When z → 0, for the dilaton we ﬁnd

eφ ∼ eφ0 − 44 b0

O1(~x) ≡ tr (F1 ∧ F1 + F2 ∧ F2) (~x) ,

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

(55)

(56)

which, as explained in Sec. 2, couple to c and C2, respectively. Now, recall from
(15) that

while (18) implies

d(e−φ + ic) = 0 ,

F3 = dC2 = −id((e−φ + ic)B) = −id((e−φ + ic)T ω) ,

(53)

(54)

therefore, we can obtain the corresponding solutions for c and C2, i.e., c ∼ e−φ, and
C2 ∼ T ω. Further, using the above recipe the coeﬃcients of the subleading terms
in (49) and (50) determine the vevs:

hO1(~x)i ∼

(z2

1 + (~x − ~x1)2)4 .

As expected from the gauge theory side, the vev of the operators O1 and O1 are
proportional to the Yang-Mills instanton densities. This observation, as in the case
of D(-1)-branes, further supports the identiﬁcation of D-instantons with Yang-Mills
instantons of the boundary theory. Note that, if b0 6= 0, and b1 = 0, namely if

9

we have only D(-1)-branes, then hO2i = 0 and thus it would correspond to having
instantons of charge (k, k) on the boundary sitting on top of each other at ~x = ~x0
with size z0. On the other hand, when b1 6= 0, and b0 = 0, i.e., having only D1-
branes, then hO1i and hO2i 6= 0 and therefore we have instantons of charge (k, k′),
with k 6= k′, on the boundary. They are all located at ~x = ~x1 with size z1. The more
general case of b0, b1 6= 0, is simply the sum of the above instantons at two diﬀerent
locations ~x = ~x0, and ~x = ~x1. From (55), we see that if we take (z0, ~x0) = (z1, ~x1)
and let b0 = 42b2
1/11 then we have hO1i = 0, which corresponds on the boundary
with two instantons of opposite charge sitting on top of each other.

4 Action and the dual description

To motivate the boundary terms and hence the action of D-instantons, it is useful
to rewrite the action in terms of dual ﬁelds. This has a twofold beneﬁt of getting
the boundary term as well as deriving the saturating bounds. The bounds will be
the same as those we get from supersymmetry [11]. So, let us assume that the
Chern-Simons term is vanishing (as is the case for the solutions we have found), and
start with the following action:

S = −

1
4k2

10 Z (cid:16)dφ∧ ∗ dφ + e−φH∧ ∗ H + e−2φ ˜F9∧ ∗ ˜F9 + e−φF7∧ ∗ F7

which upon integration over c and C2 yields the dual description

−2c (d ˜F9 − F7∧H) − 2 C2∧dF7(cid:17) ,

S = −

1
4k2

10 Z (cid:16)dφ∧ ∗ dφ + e−φH∧ ∗ H + e−2φ ˜F9∧ ∗ ˜F9 + e−φF7∧ ∗ F7(cid:17) ,

supplemented with the Bianchi identities

˜F9 = dC8 + C6∧H ,

F7 = dC6 .

Further, let us deﬁne the Euclidean action by S = iSE, and write (58) as3

(57)

(58)

(59)

SE = −

10 Z (cid:16)(dφ − e−φ ∗ ˜F9)∧ ∗ (dφ − e−φ ∗ ˜F9) + e−φ(H − ∗F7)∧ ∗ (H − ∗F7)

(60)

−2 e−φdφ∧ ˜F9 − 2 e−φH∧F7(cid:17) .

Using the Bianchi identities, (59), the last two terms combine to a boundary term

−2Z (e−φdφ∧ ˜F9 + e−φH∧F7)
= 2Z (de−φ∧(dC8 + C6∧H) + e−φF7∧H) = 2Z d(e−φ ˜F9)

(61)

(62)

3For ω an r-form on an m-dimensional manifold, we have ∗2ω = (−1)r(m−r) ω for a Riemannian

metric, and ∗2ω = (−1)1+r(m−r) ω when the metric is Lorentzian.

10

therefore, since the ﬁrst two terms in (60) are semi positive-deﬁnite, we get a lower
bound on the Euclidean action

SE ≥ −

1
2k2

10 Z d(e−φ ˜F9) ,

and the bound is saturated whenever

By reversing the signs in (60), we could saturate the bound with

dφ = e−φ ∗ ˜F9 ,

H = ∗F7 .

dφ = −e−φ ∗ ˜F9 ,

H = − ∗ F7 ,

(63)

(64)

(65)

for which the boundary term ﬂips its sign. However, for a conﬁguration with opposite
signs; i.e., dφ = −e−φ∗ ˜F9 , H = ∗F7 , we do not get a lower bound set by a boundary
term.
Next, we wish to write the action in a dual description. First, let us write action

(57) in Euclidean space and vary with respect to ˜F9 and F7:

δSE = −1
2k2

10Z (cid:16)e−2φδ ˜F9∧ ∗ ˜F9 + e−φδF7∧ ∗ F7 + ic (dδ ˜F9 − δF7∧H) + i C2∧dδF7(cid:17)

where i comes from rotating to Euclidean signature. Setting δSE = 0, we get

˜F9 = ie2φ ∗ dc ,

F7 = ieφ ∗ ˜F3 .

(66)

Plugging this back into the action gives back the original action (11), now accom-
panied by the boundary terms:

SE = −

1
4k2

10 Z (cid:16)dφ∧ ∗ dφ + e2φdc∧ ∗ dc + e−φH∧ ∗ H + eφ ˜F3∧ ∗ ˜F3

−2d(c e2φ ∗ dc + eφC2∧ ∗ ˜F3)(cid:17) .

(67)

(68)

We can now see that equations (64) for which the bound is saturated are in fact
conﬁgurations (15) that preserve supersymmetry. Using (64) and (66), we have

dφ = e−φ ∗ ˜F9 = −ieφdc
H = ∗F7 = −ieφ ˜F3 ,

(69)
(70)

which are the same equations as (15). Further, using the above equations we can
see that the boundary terms in both descriptions, i.e., (62) and (68), coincide.

Having obtained the lower bound on the action, let us now compute it for the

(saturated) solutions that we found in the Sec. 3. From (63), we have

SE = −

d(e−φ ˜F9) = −

where boundary ∂M consists of a part at z → 0, and two small spheres around the
D(-1)-brane at (z0, ~x0), and D1-brane at (z1, ~x1). Taking the exterior derivative of
dilaton solution (45), doing the Hodge dual and then taking the limit z → 0 we
obtain

and the fact that the integral over the two small spheres around the D-instantons,
when their size is shrinking to zero, vanishes.

5 Conclusions

In this article, we derived explicit exact solutions of smeared D-instantons in the KW
model. The D-instantons consist of D(-1)-branes together with D1-branes. Following
[2], we argued that in this model D(-1)-branes source the sum of the instanton
densities in the gauge theory, whereas D1-branes provide a source to the diﬀerence
of these densities. We saw that with a suitable ansatz the equations of motion can be
reduced to a coupled scalar ﬁeld equations, which we then solved and examined its
boundary behaviour. This allowed us to determine the vev of the corresponding dual
operators in the gauge theory. In particular, we observed that to get and identify
instantons of charge (k, k′), with k 6= k′, on the boundary we need to include D1-
branes in the bulk. We further examined the supersymmetry of the solutions and
found that, like D(-1)-branes, they preserve half the supersymmetries. We also
discussed the dual description of the D-instantons and described the dual action
which then enabled us to write down the boundary terms and ﬁnd the saturating
bounds. At the end, we computed the action of these D-instanton solutions.
