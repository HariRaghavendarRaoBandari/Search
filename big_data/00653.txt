ABSTRACT
We formulate a set of linear equations that describe the behaviour of small eccentricities in
a protoplanetary system consisting of a gaseous disc and a planet. Eccentricity propagates
through the disc by means of pressure and self-gravity, and is exchanged with the planet
via secular interactions. Excitation and damping of eccentricity can occur through Lindblad
and corotation resonances, as well as viscosity. We compute normal modes of the coupled
disc–planet system in the case of short-period giant planets orbiting inside an inner cavity,
possibly carved by the stellar magnetosphere. Three-dimensional effects allow for a mode to
be trapped in the inner parts of the disc. This mode can easily grow within the disc’s lifetime.
An eccentric mode dominated by the planet can also grow, although less rapidly. We compute
the structure and growth rates of these modes and their dependence on the assumed properties
of the disc.

1 INTRODUCTION

A signiﬁcant fraction of extrasolar planets that have so far been dis-
covered are known to have large orbital eccentricities. In particular,
radial-velocity surveys have shown that giant planets far enough
from their host stars not to suffer strong tidal circularization have
eccentricities spanning the whole range from zero to near-unity
(see, e.g., Marcy et al. 2005; Butler et al. 2006). Kane et al. (2012)
conﬁrmed that this feature was still present in the transit survey
obtained with the Kepler mission, and argued that the mean eccen-
tricity increases with planet size, although Plavchan et al. (2014)
cautioned that uncertainties in the measurement of stellar radii in
the Kepler sample can affect this result. Theories of the formation
and evolution of planetary systems have yet to explain this wide
distribution of eccentricities.

It is likely that mutual gravitational interactions between plan-
ets in a gas-free environment can cause their eccentricities to
grow to near-unity values. This can be the result of a violent
scattering (Rasio & Ford 1996; Weidenschilling & Marzari 1996;
Chatterjee et al. 2008; Juri´c & Tremaine 2008) or dynamical re-
laxation (Papaloizou & Terquem 2001; Adams & Laughlin 2003)
of a large population of planets. Kozai-Lidov oscillations, caused
by a stellar companion (Wu & Murray 2003; Fabrycky & Tremaine
2007; Naoz et al. 2012), a planet (Naoz et al. 2011), or a disc
(Terquem & Ajmia 2010; Teyssandier et al. 2013a), can also pump
up eccentricities. Finally, chaotic diffusion of angular momen-
tum deﬁcit can increase eccentricities and inclinations over very
long timescales, a process known as secular chaos (Wu & Lithwick

⋆ E-mail: jt591@cam.ac.uk

2011). However, the initial conditions required to trigger these
mechanisms often require the planets to have a certain amount of
eccentricity to start with. It is unclear whether this amount is real-
istic or not, as it is currently difﬁcult to predict planetary eccentric-
ities at the beginning of the gas-free stage of dynamical evolution.
Another mechanism by which planets could gain eccentrici-
ties is their gravitational interaction with the protoplanetary disc in
which they formed, in particular through mean-motion resonances
between the planet and the disc. Since the resonant interactions in-
volve an exchange of energy and angular momentum between the
planet and disc, as well as a dissipative loss of energy from the sys-
tem, they can affect the orbital eccentricities of both the planet and
the disc.

It is now widely accepted that low-mass planets with small
eccentricities that are unable to open a gap in a circular disc are
expected to experience a relatively rapid eccentricity damping.
Ward (1988) showed that material orbiting at the same radius as
the planet exerts a strong torque via coorbital resonances. This
torque overcomes that of the non-coorbital resonances discussed
by Goldreich & Tremaine (1980) and results in eccentricity damp-
ing. This result holds as long as the surface density in the coorbital
region is not strongly depleted. A reﬁned analytical treatment of
this problem was carried out by Artymowicz (1993), and a similar
result was obtained semi-analytically by Tanaka & Ward (2004).
Numerical simulations of eccentric low-mass planets embedded in
2D and 3D discs (see, e.g., Cresswell et al. 2007; Bitsch & Kley
2010) have conﬁrmed these ﬁndings.

One the other hand, Goldreich & Tremaine (1980) considered
a satellite that is massive enough to open a gap in a circular disc
(the same applies to gap-opening giant planets in protoplanetary

2

Teyssandier & Ogilvie

discs), and showed that eccentric Lindblad resonances (ELRs) act
to increase the eccentricity of the satellite, while the net effect
of eccentric corotation resonances (ECRs) is to decrease the ec-
centricity. They concluded that, to lowest order in eccentricity,
ECRs dominate by a small margin, and prevent eccentricity growth.
An important breakthrough was achieved by Goldreich & Sari
(2003) and Ogilvie & Lubow (2003) in their study of the satura-
tion of the corotation torque (see also Goldreich & Tremaine 1981).
Goldreich & Sari (2003) noted that, unlike Lindblad resonances,
corotation resonances readily undergo a nonlinear saturation. Thus
there is a ﬁnite-amplitude instability which can occur if the ec-
centricity exceeds a small critical value. Ogilvie & Lubow (2003)
derived an expression for the level of saturation of the corotation
torque in a three-dimensional gaseous disc.

The above description makes the signiﬁcant assumption that
the disc remains circular. However, a general Keplerian disc in-
volves nested elliptical orbits, and the secular interaction between
the planet and the disc inevitably leads them to exchange eccen-
tricity. Excitation of the eccentricity of a disc has been found to
be important in various astrophysical contexts, such as in the rings
of Uranus (Goldreich & Tremaine 1981), or in superhump binary
stars (Whitehurst 1988; Lubow 1991). A more general description
is therefore desirable, in which both the planet and the disc are al-
lowed to have eccentric orbits. Theories of eccentric gaseous discs
have been discussed in the past by, e.g., Kato (1983) and Ogilvie
(2001). Moreover, Ogilvie & Barker (2014) recently developed a
local model of eccentric discs, in which they explored non-linear
vertical oscillations and deduced the linear global evolution of ec-
centricity, and then studied the hydrodynamical instability of such
discs in Barker & Ogilvie (2014).

Away from the coorbital region, the disc–planet interaction
can be regarded as twofold. First, for the long-term orbit-averaged
(secular) interaction, an analogy with planetary dynamics can be
made. In celestial mechanics, the secular interaction between plan-
ets can be described by an eigenvalue problem, usually known
as the Laplace–Lagrange theory (Murray & Dermott 1999). In
this theory, a reversible exchange of eccentricity occurs on long
timescales (compared to orbital periods), and the total angular mo-
mentum deﬁcit (AMD, a positive-deﬁnite measure of the eccen-
tricity of the coupled system) of the system is conserved. (At this
level of approximation, the inclinations undergo a similar, although
decoupled, evolution.) A similar process can occur in disc–planet
interactions, where the disc can be regarded as a continuum of rings
of matter interacting with the planet, and with each other. As in the
case of a planetary system, AMD is conserved in gravitational sec-
ular disc–planet interactions. We remark here that for a planet on
an initially eccentric orbit interacting with a circular disc, secular
exchange of angular momentum would cause the eccentricity of the
planet to decay at ﬁrst, while that of the disc increases.

The second part of the interaction occurs through mean-
motion resonances, leading to an irreversible evolution in which
the AMD can either increase or decrease. A theory of mean-motion
resonances allowing for the eccentricities and inclinations of both
the satellite and the disc to vary was formulated by Ogilvie (2007).
Previously, a linear theory of disc–planet interactions was formu-
lated by Lubow & Ogilvie (2001) in the case of inclination, em-
bodying secular and resonant contributions. Unlike previous work
(see, e.g., Borderies et al. 1984), the disc was allowed to develop
a warped shape, which is likely if the planet and the disc have
comparable angular momenta. The linear theory allows for a set of
normal modes which can grow or decay according to the balance
between resonances (which mostly increase the AMD) and viscous

dissipation of the warp (which decreases it). Unlike Borderies et al.
(1984), Lubow & Ogilvie (2001) found that, after allowing the disc
to become warped, inclination growth was suppressed by viscous
damping for typical estimates of viscosity and disc parameters (al-
though Borderies et al. (1984) were concerned with interaction be-
tween planetary rings and moons, while Lubow & Ogilvie (2001)
were studying protoplanetary discs).

The results of Lubow & Ogilvie (2001) regarding inclination
highlight the fact that the secular evolution of the disc and that of
the planet(s) are strongly coupled, and should be treated together
rather than separately. The same statement can be made for eccen-
tricities: in a system consisting of a disc and one or more plan-
ets, having comparable angular momenta, eccentricity is freely ex-
changed between the various components on secular timescales.
To address the origin of eccentricity in protoplanetary systems, it
is therefore more appropriate to ask under what conditions the to-
tal AMD of the coupled system, rather than the eccentricity of a
planet, can grow.

Several numerical simulations of disc–planet interactions (or
related systems) have investigated the possibility of eccentricity
growth. Artymowicz et al. (1991) found, using smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH), that the eccentricity of a binary star can
increase through its interaction with a circumbinary disc. In this
case the gap is so wide that only the 1:3 ELR is present (and
no ECR), so that the damping argument of Goldreich & Tremaine
(1980) is not applicable. The mechanism is analogous to that op-
erating in superhump binary stars, where the eccentricity of the
circumstellar disc is excited and only the 3:1 resonance is oper-
ative. Such excitation was readily observed in grid-based simula-
tions by Kley et al. (2008), with rapid growth rates. In the case
of disc–planet interactions, Papaloizou et al. (2001) showed that
massive planets (e.g., those of 20 Jupiter masses) could experi-
ence eccentricity growth, with the exterior disc also becoming no-
ticeably eccentric. Kley & Dirksen (2006) found that, even if the
planet is held on a ﬁxed circular orbit, the disc can become ec-
centric for planets exceeding about 3 Jupiter masses (for typical
disc parameters). Without ﬁxing the planet’s orbit, d’Angelo et al.
(2006) found growing eccentricities for planetary masses as small
as 1 Jupiter mass. This extension of the work by Artymowicz et al.
(1991) and Papaloizou et al. (2001) was made possible through
the use of high-resolution two-dimensional numerical simulations
over several thousand planetary orbits. In contrast with circumbi-
nary discs, they found that the 1:3 ELR was highly ineffective at
pumping the eccentricity, and that the 2:4 and 3:5 ELRs were the
most efﬁcient ones, with additional contributions arising from res-
onances located within the gap. Cresswell et al. (2007) studied the
evolution of eccentricity and inclination of non-gap-opening plan-
ets, and conﬁrmed that their eccentricities (and inclinations) would
be damped by the disc, in good agreement with the semi-analytical
work by Tanaka & Ward (2004). This result was later conﬁrmed
by Bitsch & Kley (2010) for various planet masses, up to 1 Jupiter
mass, in three-dimensional isothermal and fully radiative discs.
Perhaps most relevant to the present work is the study by Rice et al.
(2008) of a hot Jupiter orbiting inside the magnetospheric cavity of
the star. The authors found eccentricity growth for massive planets,
which would eventually lead to the destruction of the planet, and
possibly explain the paucity of very massive planets on short-period
orbits. We will discuss these claims in the present paper. More re-
cently, Dunhill et al. (2013) have claimed, using SPH simulations,
that only very massive planets (e.g., those of 20 Jupiter masses) em-
bedded in discs with high surface densities could experience eccen-
tricity growth, although their simulations were limited to a few hun-

dred orbital periods. One the other hand, Duffell & Chiang (2015)
recently argued that disc–planet interactions can indeed increase
the eccentricity of a Jupiter-mass planet embedded in an isother-
mal disc. Such growth is possible when the planet opens a deep
gap, and only if its initial eccentricity exceeds a threshold value,
similarly to what was predicted analytically by Goldreich & Sari
(2003). Finally, Tsang et al. (2014) argued in favour of eccentric-
ity growth for gap-opening planets in non-barotropic discs. They
showed that when stellar illumination heats the gap to a certain
threshold, the corotation torque can be reduced to a point where it
is not able to damp eccentricity.

In this paper we present a linear theory of eccentricity evo-
lution in disc–planet systems. Our theory is analogous to the one
established for inclination by Lubow & Ogilvie (2001). It is also
related to the work by Papaloizou (2002) but differs by including
a new treatment of mean-motion resonances between planets and
discs (Ogilvie 2007) and a three-dimensional description of the dy-
namics of eccentric discs (Ogilvie 2001, 2008). We aim to compare
our results with previous analytical studies (e.g., Goldreich & Sari
2003) as well as numerical simulations such as that of Rice et al.
(2008). The equations describing the behaviour of eccentricity are
presented in Section 2. The associated conservation laws and equa-
tions for the angular momentum deﬁcit of the system are obtained
in Section 3, together with integral relations for the precession
rates and the growth rates of normal modes. An analogy with the
Schrödinger equation and an application to a numerical solution for
a non-self-gravitating disc are presented in Section 5, while a more
complete study that includes additional physics is carried out in
Section 6. In Section 7 we conduct a numerical exploration of the
inﬂuence of various physical parameters. In Section 8 we discuss
our results, and we conclude in Section 9.

2 EVOLUTIONARY EQUATIONS FOR AN ECCENTRIC

DISC–PLANET SYSTEM

In this section we present a set of linear equations that describe the
evolution of small eccentricities in a disc–planet system. To a ﬁrst
approximation, ﬂuid elements in an eccentric disc follow elliptical
Keplerian orbits. The eccentricity e and argument of pericenter ̟
can vary smoothly with the orbital semi-major axis a. For small
gradients in e and ̟, the orbits are nested without intersections
(Ogilvie 2001).

Throughout this paper the results are presented in terms of the
complex eccentricity E = e ei̟. Since |E| = e and arg (E) = ̟,
this variable conveniently describes both the shape and the orienta-
tion of the elliptical orbits. With similar notations, the planet has a
complex eccentricity Ep = ep ei̟p. We also denote by ap, Ωp and
Mp the semi-major axis, orbital frequency and mass of the planet,
with qp = Mp/M∗ the planet-to-star mass ratio. In addition we
denote by Md the total mass of the disc and qd = Md/M∗.

2.1 Pressure

Goodchild & Ogilvie (2006) derived a linear partial differential
equation governing the propagation of a small complex eccen-
tricity E(r, t) in a two-dimensional, non-self-gravitating, adiabatic
disc. It has the form of a dispersive wave equation related to the
Schrödinger equation. In Appendix A1 we derive a similar equa-
tion for a three-dimensional disc in which the isothermal sound
speed cs is a speciﬁed function of radius, as is commonly assumed
in numerical simulations of disc–planet systems. A similar method

can be used to derive an equation for a 3D adiabatic disc (see also

Here Ω = (GM∗/r3)1/2 is the Keplerian angular velocity around
a star of mass M∗, although our equations do take into account
the small departure from Keplerian rotation arising from the radial
pressure gradient. In addition, Σ is the surface density, P is the
vertically integrated pressure, and γ is the adiabatic index. (In the
2D model, Σ and P are simply the density and pressure that ap-
pear in the two-dimensional ﬂuid-dynamical equations.) Note that
P = Σc2
s in a locally isothermal disc. There is an equivalence be-
tween the adiabatic and isothermal models when setting γ = 1 and
assuming that cs is independent of r.

Differences between the 2D and 3D models arise from the pe-
riodic variation of the vertical gravitational force exerted on a ﬂuid
element as it goes along its elliptical orbit. The vertical variation of
the radial gravitational force also makes a difference. These effects
account for the last term in each of the 3D equations, as well as for
the different coefﬁcients in the adiabatic case. In Eq. (4) the last
term derives from 3D effects, while the preceding ‘non-adiabatic’
term results from the variation of the isothermal sound speed with
radius. The very signiﬁcant role of the 3D term for eccentric discs
around Be stars has already been demonstrated by Ogilvie (2008).

2.2 Self-gravity and secular interactions with a companion

The self-gravity of the disc can be in treated in a secular way as a
continuum version of the classical Laplace–Lagrange theory (see,
e.g., Murray & Dermott 1999). In Appendix A2, we show that self-
gravity gives rise to the following contribution:

Σr2Ω(cid:18) ∂E

=Z iGΣ(r)Σ(r′)

∂t (cid:19)dd
×(cid:2)K1(r, r′)E(r, t) − K2(r, r′)E(r′, t)(cid:3) 2πr′ dr′,

4

Teyssandier & Ogilvie

is a symmetric kernel representing the strength of the gravitational
interaction between slightly elliptical rings at radii r and r′. In
equation (5) the term K1(r, r′) represents the contribution to the
precession of the annulus at r arising from the axisymmetric grav-
itational potential generated by the annulus at r′, while K2(r, r′)
represents the forcing of the eccentricity of the ﬁrst annulus by that
of the second. We resolve the singularity at r = r′ by replacing
Km with a softened symmetric kernel:

(1 − 2β cos θ + β2)k ,

and β is the smaller solution (β < 1) of the quadratic equation

1 + β2

β

=

r2 + r′2

rr′ + s2.

The softening length is then s(rr′)1/2, and, in the limit s → 0,
β → min(r, r′)/ max(r, r′). We set s to be the scaling factor h0
which appears in the expression for the disc aspect ratio (see the
description of the disc model in Section 4.3). This gives an approx-
imation of the averaging of the gravitational potential of the disc
over its vertical extent.

Self-gravity is therefore an additional means of propagation
of eccentricity, as it gives rise to a global coupling of eccentric-
ity between different parts of the disc. The role of self-gravity in
eccentric discs was already discussed by Tremaine (2001).

The secular potential of a planet can be regarded as that of an
elliptical ring whose mass is that of the planet. Hence its contri-
bution to the eccentricity evolution is not fundamentally different
from that of self-gravity:

Σr2Ω(cid:18) ∂E

∂t (cid:19)pd

= iGMpΣ(r)

× [K1(r, ap)E(r, t) − K2(r, ap)Ep] .

(10)

Likewise, the contribution to the eccentricity evolution of the planet
is

Mpa2

pΩp(cid:18) dEp

dt (cid:19)pd

=Z iGMpΣ(r)

× [K1(ap, r)Ep − K2(ap, r)E(r, t)] 2πr dr.

(11)

We note that in the linear theory of Lubow & Ogilvie (2001), the
gravitational couplings in disc–planet systems lead to identical
equations for the complex inclination, except for a change of sign
and the replacement of K2 with K1. It is straightforward to gener-
alize the equations to the case of a multiple-planet system.

2.3 Viscosity

The mechanism by which angular momentum is transported in pro-
toplanetary discs remains poorly understood. Even if this is mod-
elled as an effective shear viscosity, its inﬂuence on the eccen-
tricity is complicated and can even lead to growth rather than de-
cay in some circumstances (Latter & Ogilvie 2006). In the present
we adopt a simpliﬁed model of eccentricity damping. Following

Goodchild & Ogilvie (2006), we employ an effective bulk viscosity
described by a Shakura-Sunyaev α-parametrization, which leads to

Σr2Ω(cid:18) ∂E

∂t (cid:19)visc

=

1
2r

∂

∂r (cid:18)αbP r3 ∂E
∂r (cid:19) ,

(12)

where αb is a dimensionless parameter such that the effective bulk
viscosity is given in terms of the pressure p by αbp/Ω. This diffu-
sive term reduces the AMD of the system, and is therefore a con-
venient representation of eccentricity damping. This effective bulk
viscosity represents whichever process (thermal or mechanical),
apart from resonances, acts to damp the eccentricity, and should
not necessarily be regarded as a hydrodynamic viscosity.

2.4 Resonances

When the planet is on an eccentric orbit, its gravitational potential
can be expanded in a Fourier series of the form

ψl,m(r) exp [i(mφ − lΩpt)]

(13)

where
Goldreich & Tremaine (1978). Here we simply state that they are
proportional to e|l−m|
where ep ≪ 1 is the planet’s eccentricity.
For a planet on a circular orbit, only terms with l = m appear.
At the ﬁrst order in eccentricity, we keep terms with l = m ± 1.
Here and in the remaining of Section 2.4 (and also in Section
3), we adopt the convention that the upper sign applies to inner
resonances (i.e., a disc interior to the planet) and the lower sign
applies to outer resonances (i.e., a disc exterior to the planet).

In a linear theory in which we work to ﬁrst order in e, two
types of resonances need to be considered. Eccentric Lindblad res-
onances (ELRs) correspond to locations in the disc where the per-
turbing frequency in the rotating frame lΩp − mΩ matches ∓κ,
the epicyclic frequency . We further assume a Keplerian disc, for
which κ = Ω. Hence, inner (resp. outer) ELRs are of the form
Ω/Ωp = j/(j − 2) (resp. Ω/Ωp = (j − 2)/j) for j > 3, where
j = m + 1. Eccentric corotation resonances (ECRs) correspond
to lΩp − mΩ = 0. Hence they occur at commensurabilities of the
form Ω/Ωp = j/(j − 1) and Ω/Ωp = (j − 1)/j for j > 2, with
j = m + 1 for an inner ECR and j = m for an outer ECR, re-
spectively. Irreversible growth and decay of eccentricity may occur
because of resonant interactions between the planet and the disc.

2.4.1 Eccentric Lindblad resonances

As we show in Appendix B, based on Ogilvie (2007), a single ELR
will contribute to the equation for the complex eccentricities of the
disc and planet in the following way:

Table 1. Resonant radii and coefﬁcients for eccentric Lindblad resonances

Table 2. Resonant radii and coefﬁcients for eccentric corotation resonances

of the disc or that of the planet, if the other is circular. In gen-
eral it is a ‘relative’ eccentricity, as measured by the linear com-
bination of A E − BEp, that tends to grow. The radial proﬁle
of the resonance is described through the dimensionless function
∆ and a resonant width wL, which represents the broadening of
Lindblad resonances by collective effects such as pressure and self-
gravity. Meyer-Vernet & Sicardy (1987) showed that the radial dis-
tribution of the torque exerted at a Lindblad resonance in a non-
self-gravitating disc is given by an Airy function of a scaled ra-
dial coordinate. The peak of the Airy function Ai(x) is very close
to x = −1, which is on the side of the resonance on which a
density wave is emitted. We model the torque distribution using
a Gaussian function ∆(x) = (2π)−1/2 exp(−x2/2) that is off-
centred by one resonant width. We ﬁnd that a Gaussian evaluated
at ((r −rres)/wL)±1 gives a reasonable representation of the Airy
function. We recall that, following our convention, the + (resp. −)
sign is for an inner (resp. outer) Lindblad resonance. As we will
discuss further, the off-centred torque distribution has the impor-
tant effect of pushing more resonances inside the disc.

A simple estimate of the resonant width wL can found from
the dispersion relation for density waves in a Keplerian disc (κ =
Ω), where self-gravity is neglected:

(lΩp − mΩ)2 = Ω2 + c2

s k2
r .

(16)

Here kr is the radial wavenumber, which vanishes at the resonance.
Lindblad resonances launch a wave in the disc, which propagates
away from the planet. Differentiating equation (16) gives

(17)

r / dr ≈

Substituting lΩp − mΩ by ∓Ω and assuming that dk2

(18)

where h0 is a typical value of the aspect ratio of the disc (see Sec-
tion 4.3). Indeed, Meyer-Vernet & Sicardy (1987) already showed
that the width of Lindblad resonances in a non-self-gravitating disc
was proportional to (H/r)2/3. Lubow (2010) found that the non-
zero width of the 3:1 ELR was important for the eccentric mode
in superhump binaries. Table 1 shows that resonances with large

values of j are intrinsically stronger than those with low values of
j, but accumulate close to the planet, where the surface density is
likely to be zero. The dependence of equation (18) on m = j − 1
means that resonances with large values of j have a decreasing
width. In the remainder of this paper, we apply a torque cutoff at
j & r/H which ensures that resonances with higher j are ineffec-
tive (Goldreich & Tremaine 1980). Finally, we note that the coef-
ﬁcient A is greatly reduced for the 1:3 resonance, because of the
contribution of the indirect term in equation (B6). Hence we expect
this resonance to give only a small contribution to the eccentric-
ity growth in the disc, especially if the planet is ﬁxed on a circular
orbit.

2.4.2 Eccentric corotation resonances

Similarly to what we derived for ELRs, a single ECR gives the
following contribution:

(20)

where again, the + (resp. −) sign is for an inner (resp. outer) coro-
tation resonance. Fluid elements in the corotation region are sub-
ject to libration around the nominal resonant radius. In the absence
of dissipative effects such as viscosity, the corotation region is a
closed system with a limited budget of angular momentum to trans-
fer to the planet. Hence, the corotation torque will eventually satu-
rate in a non-dissipative disc. When viscosity is included, the torque
will also eventually vanish if the viscous diffusion timescale across
the libration region is larger than the libration timescale. Thus,
there exists a critical viscosity below which eccentricity growth is
possible. In this picture, the resonant width is deﬁned by the size
of the libration zone. An estimate of this width was obtained by
Goldreich & Tremaine (1981) using a ballistic treatment.

Following Masset & Ogilvie (2004), we adopt the following

mmeqp(cid:1)1/2

where C ±
m are coefﬁcients which can be found in Tables 1 and 2 of
Ogilvie & Lubow (2003), and which we set to unity for simplicity,
as most of the uncertainty in our knowledge of the width lies in
our choice for e (where e could be the eccentricity of the planet,
that of the disc, or a linear combination of the two). The formula
of Masset & Ogilvie (2004) gives the full width of the resonance,
and thus should be divided by a factor of ∼ 5 to give the correct
Gaussian width. In practice, this means that the width of ECRs can
be signiﬁcantly smaller than the width of ELRs.

2.5 Short-range forces

2.5.1 General relativity correction

Relativistic corrections at the ﬁrst order in post-Newtonian expan-
sion cause an additional, prograde, contribution to the apsidal mo-
tion of the planet and the disc. Its effect has long been incorporated
and appreciated in the framework of secular planetary dynamics
(see, e.g., Adams & Laughlin 2006). To leading order in eccentric-
ity, it reads

2.5.2 Stellar oblateness

The stellar rotation causes the star to become oblate, generating a
force on the orbit that causes it to progress in a prograde manner.
This can be easily included in the framework of secular theory (see,
e.g., Murray & Dermott 1999) as

(25)

where R∗ is the stellar radius. In addition J2 represents the leading
order correction from a spherically symmetric gravitational poten-
tial. Values of J2 are poorly known and depend on the stellar spin
frequency. Values for the Sun are typically low (about 2 × 10−6),
but could be higher for fast-rotating T Tauri-type stars.

Although we give the expression for the stellar oblateness, we
have not included it in any of the calculations in the remaining of
the paper. Here we merely state that for rapidly rotating stars, its
inﬂuence on the precession of a hot Jupiter could be as important
as that of general relativity, but we chose not to include it because
of our poor knowledge of J2. Both effects simply add a prograde
contribution to the precession (see equation 39), and the absence of
the J2 term does not affect the overall conclusions of the paper.

3.1 Angular momentum deﬁcit

By analogy with celestial mechanics, it is useful to consider the
angular momentum deﬁcit (AMD) of the system. For small eccen-
tricities, the total AMD of the disc is

|E|2 Σr2Ω 2πr dr.

(26)

Ad =Z 1

2

In this Section and in Section 3.2, all integrals are carried from rin
to rout, the radial extent of the disc. With appropriate boundary
conditions, the AMD is conserved for adiabatic discs, in the ab-
sence of viscous damping or resonances (see Goodchild & Ogilvie
2006, and details in Appendix C).

A planet with a complex eccentricity Ep has an associated

AMD of the form (for small |Ep|)

Ap =

1
2

|Ep|2Mpa2

pΩp.

(27)

When secular interactions between the disc and the planet are in-
cluded (equations 10 and 11), AMD is exchanged between the disc
and the planet. For an adiabatic, inviscid disc, the conserved quan-
tity is now the total AMD of the system,

A = Ad + Ap.

(28)

Including the self-gravity of the disc (equation 5) does not affect
the AMD conservation. However, resonances will affect the AMD.
When resonances are included (equations 14–15 and 19–20), the
rate of change of AMD associated with each ELR and ECR is

We note that ELRs always act to increase the AMD, with an ef-
fect that depends on the linear combination A E − BEp of the
complex eccentricities of the planet and the disc near the resonant
location (and is approximately proportional to E − Ep). Individual
ECRs can either increase or decrease the AMD depending on their
location and the local vortensity gradient. ECR saturation, albeit
a non-linear effect, should be considered here as it can operate at
very small eccentricities. Linear equations can be obtained in the
two bracketing cases in which ECRs are either completely unsatu-
rated or completely saturated.

Viscosity acts to damp the AMD at a rate

3.2 Normal modes and integral relations

The simplest solutions of our system are normal modes of the form
E(r) eiωt, where ω is a complex eigenfrequency. Such a mode cor-
responds to a ﬁxed distribution of elliptical orbits of the disc and

planet(s), which precesses at a rate given by the real part of ω and
grows at a rate given by minus the imgainary part of ω. If the sys-
tem supports one or more normal mode with a positive growth rate,
we may expect the fastest-growing mode to dominate the evolution
of the system until it grows into a nonlinear regime.

Using the integral relations we derived in Appendix C, and
adding contributions from the planet, self-gravity and short-range
forces, we ﬁnd that the precession rate can be written

ℜ(ω) =

Ip1 + Ip2 + Ina + I3D + Idd + Ipd + ISRF

It can be shown that K1 > K2, and therefore Idd and Ipd are pos-
itive deﬁnite. Gravitational coupling leads to prograde precession,
as do the short-range forces. In the 2D case, which was already
studied by Goodchild & Ogilvie (2006), we see that the two terms
associated with pressure cause a retrograde precession of the mode,
provided that the pressure gradient is negative. The 3D term gives
rise to a prograde precession rate, and so do the terms coming from
the planet and short-range forces. The total precession rate of the
mode depends on the net contribution of all these effects.

for eccentric Lindblad resonances, eccentric corotation resonances,
viscosity and non-adiabatic effects (in the locally isothermal model
only), respectively. It clearly shows that the contribution from each
ELR always acts to increase the growth rate, while viscosity re-
duces it. The effect of each ECR depends on the local vortensity
gradient, but their net effect usually contributes to the damping of
eccentricity. It is important to notice that, in expression (41) for
the growth rate, the AMD of the mode appears in the denomina-
tor. In anticipation of the solutions in terms of normal modes that
will be presented in the remainder of the paper, we can expect that,
if an eccentric mode is conﬁned in the inner parts of the disc, and
decays towards zero in the outer parts, it should present a higher
growth rate than a less conﬁned mode, if the source terms due to
resonances are comparable.

4 SOLUTION IN TERMS OF NORMAL MODES

4.1 Numerical methods

In order to solve the eccentricity equations of Section 2, we seek
normal modes of the form E(r) eiωt for the complex eccentricity.
We can then solve the resulting eigenvalue problem for the (usu-
ally complex) frequencies ω. This is achieved by dividing the disc
into N rings, spaced equally in the variable ln r, and associating
an eccentricity to each ring. The discrete model that results from
this scheme is described in Appendix C. We use LAPACK to solve
for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the generalized eigenvalue
problem. Some spurious solutions can be generated that show os-
cillations on the grid scale, and which should be discarded. Each
mode represents a radial eccentricity distribution, and its preces-
sion and growth rates are given by the real and (negative) imaginary
part of the eigenfrequency, respectively. As a measure of the mode
order, we take the number of zeros of the real part of the eigenvec-
tor. While this is strictly valid only for a “classical” Sturm-Liouville
problem with real functions of r, we also use it as an indicator of the
mode order for our more general problem. When necessary, inte-
grals are solved numerically using a Romberg method (Press et al.
1992).

The disc extends from an inner radius rin to an outer radius

rout. For a disc with free boundaries at both edges, the boundary
conditions are

F

∂E
∂r

= 0

(46)

at rin and rout, where F is a function of r deﬁned in Appendix C.
These conditions are automatically satisﬁed by our prescription for
the surface density and pressure, as both fall to zero at each edge
(see below).

The grid resolution has to be such as the low-order modes that
are of interest here do not show any variation with resolution. We
ﬁnd that dividing the disc into N = 1000 rings gives consistent
results. A good internal check on the accuracy can be obtained by
comparing the real and imaginary parts of the eigenfrequency with
the ones obtained using the integral formulae in Section 3.2.

4.2 Units

We choose to work in physical units (astronomical units, solar
masses and years). For most parts, the disc–planet interactions
could be described in arbitrary units, but the inclusion of short-
range forces such as the general relativistic correction, which de-
pend on the distance to the star, make it more convenient to choose
physical units. Unless mentioned otherwise, the precession and
growth rates are given in units of the planet’s orbital frequency.
We keep this convention even when the planet is not included,
in order to help the comparison between the various models. In
our ﬁducial example, the planet’s orbital frequency is calculated at
ap = 0.049 au (∼ 4 d), a distance typical of hot Jupiters. Finally
we recall that since we are solving a normal mode problem, the so-
lution can be scaled by any factor and should not be interpreted as
the true eccentricity, but as being arbitrarily normalized.

4.3 Disc model

In order to solve the eccentricity equation, one needs a description
of the disc structure. Following Bell & Lin (1994), we note that in
the inner parts of the disc (from ∼ 0.1 to . 10 au), the temperature
ranges from 100 to 1000 K. In this region the opacity is mostly pro-
portional to T 1/2. This allows us to construct a simple disc model
in which the surface density is given by

wout (cid:19) ,
tanh(cid:18) rout − r

(47)

(48)

Σ = Σ0(cid:18) r

r0(cid:19)−1/2(cid:18)1 −r rin

r (cid:19)5/9

and the aspect ratio follows

H
r

= h0(cid:18)1 −r rin

r (cid:19)2/9

,

where Σ0 and r0 are characteristic values of surface density and
radius, and h0 is the limiting value of the aspect ratio at large radius.
H is deﬁned such that the vertically integrated pressure is

P = ΣΩ2H 2,

(49)

as follows from vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. With our choice
for Σ and H/r, we have

P = P0(cid:18) r

r0(cid:19)−3/2(cid:18)1 −r rin

wout (cid:19) .
r (cid:19) tanh(cid:18) rout − r

(50)

In the locally isothermal case, we relate the isothermal sound speed
to H through

cs = HΩ.

(51)

Apart from the tanh factor, this model corresponds to a steady
accretion disc with constant alpha viscosity and opacity ∝ T 1/2. In
this model, the surface density, aspect ratio and pressure naturally
go to zero at the inner edge of the disc. At the outer edge, we also
wish to have zero surface density and pressure, which is achieved
by using a tanh taper function, in which the drop to zero occurs on
a width deﬁned through wout. Here wout is taken to be 0.01rout.
The value has to be chosen according to the resolution so that quan-
tities smoothly drop off to zero over a few grid points. The exact
value has no important effect on the solution. We plot the surface
density, aspect ratio and pressure radial proﬁles in Fig. 1.

In this model, one expects the surface density to be around
1000 g cm−2 at r0 = 0.1 au (Bell et al. 1997). This implies that
Σ0 is of the order a few times 10−4 in our units.

5 A NON-SELF-GRAVITATING AND INVISCID DISC

In this section we solve the normal mode problem described in
Section 4, where the eccentricity is assumed to be of the form
E(r) eiωt. We start with the case of a disc in which viscosity,
self-gravity and resonant interactions with the planet are excluded.
However, we keep the secular part of the planet–disc interaction.
The eccentricity evolution is governed by one of the models de-
scribed by equations (1) to (4), and equation (10) with Ep = 0.

We ﬁrst illustrate the solution for a disc that extends from
rin = 0.07 au to rout = 10 au, with a mass ratio qd = 0.005,
an aspect ratio h0 = 0.05, and a viscosity αb = 4 × 10−3. In the
adiabatic case, we take the adiabatic index to be γ = 1.41. The
planet is on a ﬁxed circular orbit at ap = 0.049 au, with a mass
ratio of qp = 0.003, and we neglect the self-gravity of the disc.

The total mass of the disc is a somewhat arbitrary parameter,
since for a given surface density proﬁle it depends on the inner and
outer disc radius. Here our mass is chosen such as Σ0 = 1.3 ×
10−4, in the range of values expected for such discs. It ensures that
self-gravity can be neglected. We note here that if the disc–planet
interaction is localized in the inner part of the disc, the total disc
mass is irrelevant, as most of it is located in the outer part. A more
relevant quantity is the local disc mass near the inner edge which
we deﬁne as πΣ0r2
in. With our disc parameters, the local disc mass
is expected to be much lower than the mass of a Jovian planet.

5.1 Bound states in a potential well

In the absence of self-gravity and viscosity, the eccentricity propa-
gates through the disc solely by means of pressure, as a one-armed
density wave. The evolutionary equations of Section 2.1 are disper-
sive wave equations related to the Schrödinger equation of quantum
mechanics. A basic understanding of the physics at play can be
achieved by rewriting the equation for an eccentric normal mode as
a time-independent Schrödinger equation:

−

d2ψ
dx2 + [V (x) − E ] ψ = 0,

(52)

where x is a new independent variable related to r, ψ(x) is the
wavefunction, V (x) is an effective potential and E is the effective
energy eigenvalue. In the following we assume that the sound speed
can be written cs = ǫrΩ, where ǫ is taken to be the characteristic

1 Bitsch et al. (2013) pointed out that the adiabatic index can vary from
5/3 to 7/5 with increasing disc temperature. However the exact value of the
adiabatic index does not signiﬁcantly change our results.

while in 3D we have a = 2 − γ−1, b = 4 − 3γ−1, c = 3(1 + γ−1).
In both cases, the shape of the effective potential V can help
in understanding the trapping of the modes by analogy with bound
states of the Schrödinger equation. Typical potentials are plotted
in Fig. 2. The results are rather similar in the locally isothermal
and adiabatic cases. The proﬁles show that a deep potential well
exists in 3D, which could support a bound state in the form of a
conﬁned eccentric mode that decays at r → ∞. Since V → 0 as
r → ∞, a bound state has E < 0, and is therefore a prograde mode
(ω > 0). In 2D, the potential well is less deep, and bound states
might not exist. This distinction, which arises from the additional
prograde precession due to pressure in a 3D disc, was identiﬁed as
important by Ogilvie (2008). The potential arising from the planet
also contributes to deepening the potential well. It will turn out
to be of importance for helping the conﬁnement of 2D growing
modes.

5.2 Mode analysis for a non-self-gravitating disc

We start by solving the eigenvalue problem for a simple case of
a non-self-gravitating, inviscid disc without a planet, short-range
forces or self-gravity. We use the parameters given at the beginning
of Section 5.

In Fig. 3, we represent the mode shape of the four lowest-order
modes. In this simple model, major differences between 2D and 3D
adiabatic and isothermal discs appear. In 3D, there exists a mode of
order 0 which is conﬁned in the inner parts of the disc, in agreement
with what we speculated in Section 5.1. This mode decays on the
characteristic length of 1 au, and is insensitive to the outer bound-
ary condition as long as rout & 1 au. Higher-order modes do not
always decay to zero at large radii, and might therefore be sensi-
tive to the outer radius. However they contain a signiﬁcantly larger
amount of AMD, and are therefore expected to grow less rapidly, as
we will conﬁrm in Section 6.1. In Table 3 we show the precession
rates of these modes. The disc supports three prograde modes, all
the others being retrograde. Although we do not include a planet
in this calculation, we still give the precession and growth rates in
units of the planet’s orbital frequency at ap = 0.049 au, since it
will help comparing with the next section where we include the
planet.

In 2D, there no longer exists a mode which is trapped in the
inner parts of the disc (see right panels of Fig. 11). This is especially
true in the adiabatic case where all modes show a large eccentricity
distribution at large radii. As can be seen in Table 3, 2D discs only
support a set of retrograde modes.

5.3 Secular perturbations from a planet

The secular perturbation from the planet gives rise to an additional
source of prograde precession in the disc. Previously, we have noted
that the planet helps to deepen the effective potential well, and
could therefore assist the trapping of a mode in the inner part of
the disc (see Section 5.1 and Fig. 2).

Our choice of semi-major axis is such that ap/rin = 0.7.
The planet is expected to migrate into the cavity via tidal inter-
action with the disc, until its 1:2 outer Lindblad resonance (OLR)
lies just inside the inner edge of the disc, which here would be
ap/rin ≈ 0.63. The planet should then remain at a constant semi-
major axis, a convenient setup in our secular framework. With our
choice of surface density proﬁle, motivated by the truncation of the
disc by a magnetospheric cavity, the surface density falls to zero
at r = rin and exerts no torque on the planet within this radius.
Instead we expect the planet to mostly interact with the peak of
the surface density just outside the inner edge. Therefore the planet
should stop slightly closer to the disc than the 1:2 orbital commen-

surability with the inner edge, and we choose the ﬁducial value of
ap/rin = 0.7. We point out that in the study of planets in cav-
ities by Rice et al. (2008), Jupiter-mass planets stalled at orbital
distances ap/rin = 0.6 to 0.7 over the few hundred orbits over
which the simulations were performed. We recall that in our sec-
ular treatment of disc–planet interactions, it was assumed that the
semi-major axis of the planet was constant in time. We discuss the
inﬂuence of ap in Section 7.3.

In Fig. 4 we show the mode shape, and the associated pre-
cession rates are displayed in Table 4. In 3D, the effect of adding
a planet on the mode shape is negligible, as the mode is already
trapped in the deep effective potential due to 3D pressure effects
and discussed in Section 5.1. The planet enhances the prograde
precession of these modes, but does not strongly affect the retro-
grade modes, which are pure disc modes. In 2D, the planet is ob-
served to reduce the amplitude of the mode in the outer parts of
the disc compared to that of the inner parts. Here a signiﬁcant dif-
ference arises between the 2D isothermal and adiabatic cases. In
the isothermal case, the additional contribution of the planet to the
potential well is enough to conﬁne the lowest-order mode in the in-
ner parts of the disc, while in the adiabatic case this mode ‘leaks’
into the outer disc. When resonant and viscous effects are added
in the next section, this will have important consequences for the
growth of the mode. In Table 4 we can see that the lowest-order 2D
isothermal mode has become prograde owing to the inclusion of
the planet, while the 2D adiabatic modes are only weakly affected
by the planet (see Table 3 for comparison). In the example that we
show here, the perturbation from the planet is not strong enough to
cause any mode to precess progradely in the 2D adiabatic calcula-
tion. However more massive planets closer to the disc’s inner edge
could assist the conﬁnement of a 2D progade mode.

6 A MORE REALISTIC EXAMPLE

In this Section, we progressively add more physical effects to our
disc model, and show how they affect the shape, precession rate
and growth rate of the modes. The physical parameters for the disc
and the planet are the same as in Section 5.

6.1 Viscosity and resonant interactions

We ﬁrst add effects that will contribute to the growth rate: viscosity,
and eccentric Lindblad and corotation resonances. The planet is
kept on a ﬁxed circular orbit. The shape of the modes is shown
in Fig. 5, and the corresponding precession rates and growth rates
are displayed in Table 5. The shape of the 3D modes is slightly
different from Fig. 4 because the eccentricity now has an imaginary
component that shifts the location of local minima away from zero.
However, comparing Table 5 with Table 4 shows that the precession
rate of these modes remain similar. In 3D, the lowest-order mode,
which is conﬁned in the inner parts of the disc, contains a very

small amount of AMD. This mode therefore has the highest growth
rate. The growth rates are fairly similar in the adiabatic and locally
isothermal 3D cases, and the fastest growing mode can grow in
3 × 103 orbital periods of the planet, which is short compared to
the disc’s lifetime if the planet has an orbital period of 3 to 4 days.
In 2D, the lowest-order modes in the adiabatic case do not
present signiﬁcant differences from what was found in Section 5.3.
The precession rates are similar and, because no mode is conﬁned
in the inner disc, all modes have relatively low growth rates, much
lower than in 3D. However there exists a series of higher-order
modes that decay slowly at large radii, but do not show the large-
amplitude oscillations of the lowest-order mode. These modes are
of order 6 to 10, and all show growth rates of about 10−5. We show
in Fig. 5 and Table 5 the fastest growing of these modes, which is
of order 7.

The 2D isothermal case is more subtle. As can be seen in Ta-
ble 5, the only prograde mode that was found in Table 4 has now
disappeared. The fastest growing mode is of order 2 (see Fig. 5),
and seems at odds with other growing modes because its growth
rate is faster than its precession rate. These peculiar modes only ap-
pear because of the resonant effects, which can impose a very fast
growth rate to a mode, which then decays rapidly towards the outer
boundary. This decay occurs before the mode has time to prop-
agate to the outer boundary and reﬂect to form a standing wave.
Because this mode is conﬁned in the inner disc it grows faster than
the fastest growing mode in the 2D adiabatic case. As we will see
in Section 7.1 these modes can also appear in 3D. The analogy with
a Schrödinger equation is harder to establish in this case since the
potential now contains an imaginary part as well. In particular it is
possible for a mode to be trapped in a complex effective potential
with a retrograde precession rate and a positive growth rate. The
three other modes in the 2D adiabatic regime have an equivalent in
Table 4, although the mode order can be different.

Using Equations (42)–(45), we can study the contribution of
different physical effects to the growth and decay of eccentricity. In
Fig. 6 we show, in the case of a 3D adiabatic disc, the normalized
contribution from the ﬁrst few ELRs and ECRs. The contribution of
ECRs is actually negative (causing a damping of eccentricity), and
we plot its absolute value. The contribution from viscosity is negli-
gible in this case. It clearly appears that the only ECR contributing
to the damping is the 1:2. Regarding ELRs, the 1:3 is rather ineffec-
tive at exciting the eccentricity. The main contributions come from
the 2:4 and 3:5 ELRs, with a smaller contribution from the 4:6. Al-
though the 2:4 ELR shares the same nominal radius as the 1:2 ECR,
we recall that the peak of the torque distribution of the ELR is actu-
ally slightly shifted away from the planet. In addition, the width of
ELRs is signiﬁcantly larger than the width of ECRs, allowing for a
larger part of the disc to contribute to the growth. The consequence
of the shift of the centre of the resonance is even more visible when
comparing the 4:6 ELR with the 2:3 ECR. The 2:3 ECR lies in the
cavity and is inoperative in the disc, while the 4:6 ELR is partly in
the disc and contributes to the eccentricity growth.

planet (qp = 0.005, ap = 0.07), in the 2D and 3D abiabatic and isothermal cases. The shape of the corresponding modes is shown in Fig. 4.

6.2 Back-reaction on the planet

We now allow the disc to act back on the eccentricity of the planet
(i.e. we do not assume Ep = 0 any more in all the equations where
Ep appears). Fig. 7 and Table 6 show a few modes of interest for
the disc, and the mode that is dominated by the planet (deﬁned
as the mode for which the AMD is predominantly in the planet,
and labelled “P”). The planet-dominated mode undergoes a small
prograde precession, and has a slow growth rate.

We ﬁnd that the growth rate of the planet-dominated mode is
signiﬁcantly smaller than that of the disc mode, when they both ex-
ist. Interestingly, the 2D planet mode grows on a timescale equal
to, or larger than that in 3D. This effect will appear consistently
for a large range of parameters described in Section 7. In 2D, the
planet mode does not propagate very far into the disc, and therefore
its AMD is low. On the other hand, the 3D planet mode is more

strongly coupled to the disc. It shows some oscillations and propa-
gates further into the disc. Its AMD is therefore larger, reducing its
growth rate.

In this calculation, we also include the relativistic precession
term. It appears that its effect on the disc is negligible compared
to the effect of pressure, but it provides the dominant source of
precession on the planet, competing with the precession induced
by the gravitational potential of the disc. For instance, in the 3D
adiabatic case, the precession rate of the planet-dominated mode is
4.4 × 10−7 without the GR term, while it is 1.0 × 10−6 when GR
is included.

6.3 Self-gravity

Finally, we add self-gravity to the disc. In our ﬁducial example with
qd = 0.005, the effect of self-gravity is negligible, so we arbitrarily

Figure 7. The four lowest-order modes of our ﬁducial example for a viscous, non-self-gravitating disc, including secular and resonant interactions with a planet,
and back-reaction on the planet, for the four different models: 3D adiabatic, 2D adiabatic, 3D isothermal and 2D isothermal. The relativistic contribution to
precession is also included. We show here the distribution of eccentricity in the disc, truncated at the disc’s inner edge rin = 0.07. All modes but one have a
negligible amount of eccentricity (or AMD) in the planet, and we do not show it here. For the mode dominated by the planet, the eccentricity in the planet is
represented by a black dot at the location of the planet (ap = 0.049), which links to the corresponding mode in the disc. The number in the top right corner
indicates the order of the corresponding mode. Their precession rates are given in Table 6.

multiply it by a factor of 100 in this section. In Fig. 8 and Table 7
we show, for the 3D adiabatic model only, how self-gravity affects
the modes when it is included compared to when it is not. Without
self-gravity, the disc modes are not signiﬁcantly affected when the
mass of the disc is increased, but the growth rate of the planet-
dominated mode is signiﬁcantly increased, since it depends on the
mass of the disc. The main effect of adding self-gravity is to cause
more modes to precess progradely in the disc. There still exists a
zero-order conﬁned mode that is equivalent to the one that is found
when self-gravity is not included. However the higher-order disc
modes are affected by self-gravity. Most notably, there is now a
low-order mode that propagates outwards in the disc, with a large
AMD in its outer part, and hence a low growth rate.

The planet-dominated mode remains mostly unchanged, al-
though its growth rate is slightly lower with the inclusion of self-
gravity. While the planet mode decays to zero in the inner part of
the disc without self-gravity, it now becomes oscillatory, and there-
fore carries more AMD, reducing its growth rate.

In this example we have chosen a high value of surface den-
sity, perhaps unrealistic, in order to highlight the role of self-
gravity. For more realistic surface density values, we ﬁnd that self-
gravity does not play an important role in the eccentricity evolution.

7 INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS PARAMETERS

Using a complete description of the disc–planet interactions that
encompasses all the effects described above, we explore the be-
haviour of the precession rate and growth rate when varying differ-
ent physical parameters.

In what follows, we study only the adiabatic case, in 2D and
3D. We identify the mode in the disc with the largest growth rate,
which we label “disc mode” in all ﬁgures. We also characterize
the evolution of the planet, by identifying the growing mode whose
AMD is mostly located in the planet. We label this mode the “planet
mode”.

Our parameter survey is based on the previous ﬁducial values:
Σ0 = 1.3 × 10−4 (i.e. qd = 0.005), rin = 0.07, rout = 10,
h0 = 0.05, αb = 0.004, ap = 0.049 (such that ap/rin = 0.7)
and qp = 0.003. In each case, we allow one parameter to vary and
discuss how it affects the precession and growth rates.

7.1 Mass of the planet

By analogy with the Schrödinger equation, we expect that the more
massive the planet is, the deeper the effective potential well near
the inner edge of the disc will be. This, in turn, can help the con-

ﬁnement of a mode in the inner parts of the disc, with small AMD,
and hence a large growth rate. In this Section we explore the vari-

ation of the precession and growth rate as functions of the planet
mass. Results are shown in Fig. 9.

In the disc, 3D effects allow for the conﬁnement of a mode,
but the growth of this mode is determined by the balance between
resonant effects and viscosity. For low-mass planets, viscosity pre-
vents the resonant growth. This explains why, in Fig. 9, the growth
of the eccentric mode in the 3D disc becomes possible only when
qp & 3 × 10−4. In 2D, the growth only happens for qp & 8 × 10−4
with our choice of parameters. When the mass of the planet is too
low, the main contribution to the growth rate (Eq. [41]) comes from
the viscous term (Eq. [44]) which prevents damping. In addition, a
small planet mass prevents the conﬁnement of a mode in 2D. Only
when the planet becomes sufﬁciently massive can the mode be-
come signiﬁcantly trapped, which in turn favours the growth. For
very massive planets, the 2D mode is trapped in the deep potential
created by the planet, and can grow on a timescale similar to the
3D case.

As we have already noted in Section 6.2, the planet-dominated
mode experiences a faster growth in 2D than in 3D, but its growth
is overall much smaller than the growth of disc-dominated modes.
In 2D, the fastest growing disc-mode is retrograde, and we
plot the absolute value of its precession rate in Fig. 9. The 3D disc
supports a series of low-order prograde modes that are conﬁned
in the inner parts of the disc. An additional interesting feature ap-
pears in the 3D case: when qp & 0.005, the fastest growing mode
becomes retrograde (and therefore is not plotted in Fig. 9, which
is in logarithmic scale). Such modes, which we already discussed
in 2D in Section 6.1, are in apparent contradiction with the re-

qp & 5 × 10−3, and therefore does not appear on this logarithmic scale plot. Similarly, the disc mode is decaying for qp . 3 × 10−4 (resp. 8 × 10−4) in
3D (resp. 2D), and is not shown here.

sults of Section 5.1, which predicted that the conﬁned mode should
be prograde. Conﬁned retrograde modes are purely a consequence
of the resonant growth of eccentricity. When the planet’s mass is
large enough, the growth rate becomes faster than the precession
rate. Physically, this corresponds to a mode that grows faster in the
vicinity of the planet than it propagates towards the outer parts of
the disc. Such 3D retrograde modes however are rather rare, and in
most cases the 3D conﬁned growing mode is progade.

7.2 Mass of the disc

One can expect that, when self-gravity is negligible, the precession
and growth rates of the eccentricity of the disc do not depend on
the disc mass. Indeed, the evolutionary equations (1)–(4), or equiv-
alently the effective potentials given in equations (53) and (54), are
independent of the scaling factor Σ0 that determines the total mass
of the disc, provided that the contribution of the planet to the mode
is negligible.

For the planet mode, since most of the AMD is contained in
the planet, we have A ∼ |Ep|2Mpa2
pΩp/2, which is independent
of Σ0, while all contributions to the growth rate are proportional to
Σ0, so we expect the growth rate to scale linearly with the disc mass
(see Eq. 41). Regarding the precession rate of the planet-dominated
mode, the secular contribution from the disc also scales linearly
with disc mass (see Eq. 38). At low disc mass, the precession rate of
the planet is only weakly affected by the secular contribution from
the disc. The main contribution in this regime comes from gen-
eral relativity (and other short-range forces if they were included),
which is independent of disc mass (see Eq. 39).

The behaviours described above can be seen in Fig. 10, where
the precession and growth rates are plotted against the disc-to-star
mass ratio qd. There exists a 3D disc mode that precesses pro-
gradely and independently of disc mass (an equivalent 2D mode
exists, but has a retrograde precession rate which does not appear
on this logarithmic plot). As explained above, the precession rate
of the planet mode is a combination of general relativity (indepen-
dent of the disc mass) at low disc mass and secular effects from the
disc (proportional to the disc mass) at high disc mass. There ex-
ists a growing eccentric mode in the disc, which grows much more

rapidly in 3D than in 2D. This is mostly due to our choice of param-
eters: the planet is not massive enough and close enough to the in-
ner edge of the disc to allow for the conﬁnement of a mode in the in-
ner part of the disc in 2D. Both in 2D and 3D, the disc modes show
no dependence on disc mass, as expected. The planet modes scale
linearly with the disc mass, as was also expected. As discussed at
the end of Section 7.1, there is a tendency for the 2D planet mode
to contain less AMD than its 3D counterpart, and therefore grow
more rapidly.

The total mass of the disc is not necessarily an appropriate
measurement of the perturbation induced by the disc on the planet.
It is the local mass of the disc near the inner edge that mostly in-
teracts with the planet. It can be deﬁned as πΣ0r2
in, the amount of
mass near the inner edge of the disc if its surface density was not
decaying to zero. In Fig. 10 we also show this quantity for a given
disc mass on the top x-axis. For the disc masses considered here,
the local inner mass of the disc is lower than the mass of the planet.
In addition, self-gravity is not expected to play an important role
for these discs. In Section 8.1, where we compare our results with
existing simulations in the literature, we will see an example where
the local mass in the inner disc is larger than the mass of the planet,
and how this leads to a mode switching.

7.3 Location of the planet

The theory of disc–planet interactions suggests that, once a planet
enters the central cavity of the disc, it will stop migrating when the
torque exerted by the Lindblad resonances vanishes, as the reso-
nances all fall into the clean gap. In this Section we investigate the
inﬂuence of the orbital radius of the planet on the precession and
growth rates of eccentric modes.

The semi-major axis of the planet is expected to be of primary
importance regarding the possibility for eccentric modes to grow in
a disc. In addition to determining how many resonances are located
in the disc, it plays a major role in shaping the potential well in
which a mode can be conﬁned, especially in 2D (see Eq. 53–54).

The precession and growth rates of the fastest growing mode
are displayed in Fig. 11, as functions of ap/rin. We choose this
variable as it help visualizing the effect of resonances. We recall

that we have chosen rin = 0.07 au, and our ﬁducial example de-
scribed above has ap/rin = 0.7. In 3D, when the planet is far
enough from the disc, eccentricity evolution is dominated by vis-
cous damping, which prevents any mode to grow. Only when the
planet starts getting closer to the disc can the 1:3 ELR eventually
overcome viscous damping and give rise to eccentricity growth.
However, as discussed in Section 6.1, the amplitude of the contri-
bution from the 1:3 ELR is rather weak, and the overall growth rate
is small. As the planet gets closer to the disc’s inner edge, the 2:4
ELR and 3:5 ELR become the major source of eccentricity growth,
while the 1:2 ECR damps it. The dip in eccentricity growth seen
at ap/rin ∼ 0.64 corresponds to the location where the 1:2 ECR
is most effective at damping AMD (we prefer to talk about AMD
rather than eccentricity here, since it is the eccentricity weighted by
the surface density proﬁle that really matters for the growth of the
mode).

It might seem puzzling at ﬁrst that such a growing mode exists
and that ECRs are rather ineffective at damping it. We ﬁnd that the
resonant widths of both ELRs and ECRs play a major role in this
process. As we have noted in Section 2.4, ELRs are better modelled
if their centre is shifted by one resonant width in the direction away
from the planet. Hence, ELRs for which the nominal radius is in the
cavity can actually operate quite strongly in the disc. From Table 1,
one would expect that, if ap/rin = 0.7, only the 1:3 ELR would be
located deeply in the disc, with the 2:4 ELR just at the edge of the
disc, and all the other resonances in the cavity. However, allowing
all the ELRs to be shifted and to have a ﬁnite width enables for
the 2:4, 3:5, 4:6 and possibly higher order ELRs to sit in the disc.
On the other hand, ECRs do not have this shift, and have a very
narrow width. Hence, only the 1:2 resonance can operate in the
disc, and it does not provide enough damping to strongly affect the
net growth rate. According to Fig. 11, only when the planet orbits at
ap/rin ≈ 0.64 can the growth rate be signiﬁcantly reduced. This is
not surprising as it corresponds to the radius at which the 1:2 ECR
starts being located inside the disc. As the planet gets closer to the
disc, more and more ELRs enter the disc and progressively make
the 1:2 ECR ineffective, recovering the result where only ELRs are
taken into account. Hence, even without saturation of the corotation
torque, eccentric modes can grow because of eccentric Lindblad
resonances.

In 2D, the growing mode appears when the planet is slightly

closer to the inner edge of the disc, compared to the 3D case. As
we have seen in Section 5.1, it is much harder to trap a mode in
a deep potential well in 2D than in 3D. In fact, while a 3D disc
naturally supports a set of conﬁned prograde modes, the equivalent
mode in 2D can only be found when a planet is close enough to
the disc (and/or massive enough) to allow a relative conﬁnement of
the mode near the inner edge, which in turns allows the mode to
grow. We have also run a similar calculation with qp = 0.001, all
other parameters being equal, and we found that a growing mode in
2D only appeared for ap/rin & 0.67. Reducing the planet’s mass
decreases the depth of the effective potential well, so that only a
planet close to the inner disc can help trap a mode in 2D.

The precession rate of the planet mode is always positive (pro-
grade mode) and only weakly depends on the planet’s semi-major
axis. The disc mode has a negative precession rate in 2D (retro-
grade mode) and we plot its absolute value in Fig. 11. It precesses
progadely in 3D, with a signiﬁcant jump in precession rate as soon
as the mode is allow to grow.

These results depend on the value we adopt for the resonant

width. We explore this dependence in Section 7.6.

7.4 Disc aspect ratio

We vary the disc aspect ratio h0 in Fig. 12. How the precession
and growth rates should vary with h0 is not obvious from Section
3.2. Several contributions to the precession rate are proportional to
pressure and therefore to h2
0; however, these integrals also depend
on the mode shape, which in turn depends in a non-trivial way on
h0. The aspect ratio also appears indirectly in the ELR width (see
equation 18).

The precession rate of a 2D disc shows that for small h0 the
fastest growing mode in the disc has a progade precession, which
decreases as h0 increases, until it becomes negative. In 2D the
pressure-induced precession scales as h2
0, such as for thin discs, the
precession rate is dominated by the prograde contribution coming
from the planet. This prograde contribution is eventually overcome
by the pressure term when the disc becomes sufﬁciently thick, and
the precession is retrograde. When h0 is small, the potential well in
which the mode is trapped arises mainly from the planet, with little

contribution from pressure. In this regime, the growth rates in 2D
and 3D are therefore similar.

At large h0, the growth rate in 2D is signiﬁcantly smaller than
in 3D. A similar calculation but with qp = 0.001 instead of 0.003
showed that the growth of a 2D mode was completely suppressed
for h0 & 0.065. The 2D adiabatic case does not allow generally for
a bound state to be supported in the inner disc. Only the presence
of a planet can, in some cases, deepen the potential well and allow
for a trapped mode. This can be understood from the effective po-
tential that we derived in Eq. (54). In this equation, the last term in
the effective potential V (x) shows the competition between the po-
tential well of the planet and the disc aspect ratio (where we recall
that ǫ = h0). When h0 becomes large enough, it causes the term
due to the planet to become ineffective, and no bound state can be
supported.

In the 3D case, the growth rate of the disc-dominated mode
ﬁrst decreases before increasing again. As in the 2D case, the de-
crease can be interpreted as a consequence of the weaker conﬁne-
ment of the mode by the planet as h0 increases. However, the width
of the ELRs is an increasing function of h0, which in turns allows
for a larger growth rate, as a larger part of the disc contributes to the

growth. This explains why the growth rate slightly increases again
at large h0.

7.5 Viscosity

From the integral relations derived in Section 3.2 (see eq. 44), one
can expect the viscous damping of eccentricity to scale linearly
with αb. We have set up a calculation in which αb varies from
10−4 to 10−1, not shown here. We ﬁnd that the scaling is indeed
linear. It is important to remember that we are using an effective
bulk viscosity in this paper, representing whichever thermal or me-
chanical processes (apart from resonant effects) damp the eccen-
tricity. While it provides a convenient formulation of eccentricity
damping in a linear theory, it does not necessarily represent the
effective shear viscosity that is driving accretion. In any case our
results indicate that the bulk viscosity is not strong enough to op-
pose the resonant growth of eccentricity. Only in the case where
the 1:3 ELR is the only resonance in the disc can viscosity compete
with it (and possibly suppress the growth rate).

In the case where the planet was orbiting in a gap instead of a
cavity, viscosity would presumably play an important role in setting

the gap’s shape, and therefore in the surface density proﬁle. It is
not the case here, since we consider a planet in a cavity, whose
origin is supposed to be the truncation of the disc by the stellar
magnetosphere.

7.6 Resonant width

In Section 2.4 we have allowed the resonances to spread over a few
rings by giving them a ﬁnite width. As discussed in Section 7.3, it is
the resonant width of ELRs that allows for a large number of ELRs
to sit in the disc and contribute positively to the growth rate. How-
ever, there are some uncertainties on the exact value of the width,
for both ELRs and ECRs. Estimating the inﬂuence of the resonant
width is made difﬁcult by the parametrization we used in section
2.4 (see equations 18 and 21): each resonant width depends on the
wavenumber m, and the ELRs’ width decreases with increasing m,
while it increases for ECRs.

In order to estimate how the growth rates might be affected
by the resonant width, we adopt the following parametrization for
ELRs:

= λ(cid:18)

h2
0

3(m + 1)(cid:19)1/3

,

(55)

wL

r (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ELR

and we vary λ. In Fig. 13, we show the growth rates for 0.1 < λ <
1. For ECRs, we have varied the value of e in eq. (21) from 10−6
to 10−2 and checked that it has no signiﬁcant effect on the growth
rate, as it is always so narrow that only the 1:2 ECR lies in the disc.
We do not show the effect of varying the ECR width here, as the
plots would be similar to Fig. 13. As the width of ELRs increases,
a larger part of the disc contributes to the growth of eccentricity,
while the precession rates remain unaffected.

Although Table 1 suggests that resonances with higher j
should be stronger, this is not necessarily the case. Indeed, these
resonances lie close to the planet, and according to eq. (18), their
width decreases as j increase, and they are not broad enough to af-
fect the disc. In addition, we recall that we have applied a cutoff so
that resonances with j & r/H are not included.

Note that in Section 2.4, we have derived the resonant width
for ELRs from a dispersion relation. In principle, this dispersion
relation is modiﬁed when self-gravity is included. We ﬁnd that the
resonant width is now approximately given by the solution of the
equation

3(m + 1)

w3
L
r3 + 2π

Σ(rres)r2

0.

(56)

The additional term due to self-gravity will be zero when Σ(rres) =
0 (i.e., when the resonant radius is not in the disc). In addition,
when local disc mass at the resonant location πΣ(rres)r2
res is small,
the addition of this new term brings a negligible modiﬁcation to the
resonant width, and can be ignored. Note that we have neglected
the subtle effect caused by the shifting of the resonance location
away from the nominal resonant radius rres. This effect does not
change the general conclusion that the effect of self-gravity on the
resonant width is negligible.

8 DISCUSSION

8.1 Comparison with Rice et al. 2008

Rice et al. (2008) suggested that the paucity of hot Jupiters could
be caused by their interactions with the inner disc as they orbit

Disc–planet eccentricities

19

in the stellar magnetospheric cavity. They found that, for a wide
range of parameters, eccentricity can grow and eventually lead to
collision with the star. In order to speed up their calculations, they
increased the mass of the disc, arguing that it would simply change
the timescale on which the eccentricity grows, and that everything
can be rescaled linearly. They choose a surface density of 10−2 in
their units, which corresponds to 104 times the expected value for
such a disc.

We set up a calculation similar to theirs, of a 2D locally
isothermal disc with Σ(r) ∝ r−1 (but we keep the two taper func-
tions which cause Σ to be zero at each edge). We take h0 = 0.05,
αb = 10−3, rin = 1, rout = 10, ap = 0.7 and qp = 0.005. We
let the mass of the disc vary to cover the range from both physi-
cal values to the unrealistic (yet convenient) values of Rice et al.
(2008). The calculation does not include self-gravity or relativistic
precession.

In Fig. 14 we plot the growth rates of the disc-dominated and
planet-dominated modes, as a function of the mass of the disc qd,
and as function of the more meaningful quantity, the local disc mass
near the planet πΣ0r2
in. Since in this calculation rin = 1, it also
gives a direct measure of Σ0. Note that for a better comparison
with the results of Rice et al. (2008), we give here the growth rate
divided by the orbital period at r = rin = 1.

For Σ0 = 10−2, the growth rate is about 4 × 10−3 orbits at
r = 1, a value 10 times larger than what was found by Rice et al.
(2008). This discrepancy could arise from the different boundary
conditions at the inner radius in the two calculations (an outﬂow in
Rice et al. (2008) and a free edge in our calculation). It is also pos-
sible that a 5 Jupiter-mass planet at ap = 0.7 experiences inward
migration. We have repeated the calculation with a 1 Jupiter mass
planet, which shows no migration in Rice et al. (2008), but still ﬁnd
a higher growth rate than the authors (although the growth rate for
a 1 Jupiter mass planet is only poorly constrained in their work).

The scaling of growth rate with disc mass is linear for a wide
range of masses, as claimed by the authors. However, for a disc
with real physically motivated parameters, Σ0 would be in the
range of ∼ 10−6 in the units used for this calculation. At this
point the growth rate of the planet is lower than the growth rate
of eccentricity in the disc by 5 order of magnitudes. Therefore, in
a real disc–planet system of this kind, one expects the eccentric-
ity to grow much more rapidly in the disc-dominated mode than
in the planet-dominated mode. Here our linear model fails to pre-
dict what would happen to the coupled system in the limit of large
eccentricities. Presumably the disc mode will eventually undergo
a non-linear saturation. One could speculate that, as the disc pos-
sesses a large reservoir of AMD, it could slowly and chaotically
diffuse it in the planet, therefore exciting its eccentricity in a pro-
cess similar to secular chaos in planetary systems (Wu & Lithwick
2011). If the chaotic behaviour ﬁnds its origin in the overlapping of
two secular resonances (see, e.g., Lithwick & Wu 2011), it may be
necessary to invoke the presence of two different eccentric modes
in the disc, or additional planets. However it is possible that the
timescale of such non-linear interaction might be longer than the
disc lifetime.

Finally, we remark that the fastest growing mode in the system
switches from being a disc-dominated mode to a planet-dominated
mode when the local mass in the disc is of the order of the mass of
the planet. In the regime where the two masses are nearly equal,
there exists a strong coupling between the planet and the disc,
where they share an almost equal amount of AMD. Away from
this mode transition region, the scaling of mode with growth rate is
roughly linear.

8.2 Disc model

Our disc model described in Section 4.3 is based on a strong as-
sumption regarding the opacity in the inner parts of the disc. We
have conducted a series of runs in which the disc is described using
an α-disc model for which the surface density and aspect ratio read

Σ = Σ0(cid:18) r

r0(cid:19)−1/2(cid:18)1 −r rin

r (cid:19)7/10

and

H

= h0(cid:18)1 −r rin

r (cid:19)3/20(cid:18) r

rin(cid:19)1/8

wout (cid:19) ,
tanh(cid:18) rout − r

(57)

.

(58)

Such a model implies a slight ﬂaring of the disc with radius. We
found that the overall results described in this paper remain un-
changed with this description. A mode can still be trapped in the in-
ner part of the disc, which grows on the same timescale, and shares
the same properties regarding the difference between 2D and 3D
models.

We have chosen γ = 7/5 in the adiabatic case, but checked
that results remain similar for other values (e.g., γ = 5/3). Non-
adiabatic effects could in principle affect the eccentricity growth or
decay, but are beyond the scope of this paper.

Finally, the lowest-order mode is fairly independent of the
outer radius rout, since it decays rapidly with radius. Higher-order
trapped prograde modes are expected to decay to zero at large radii,
provided the disc’s outer radius is large enough, and should be in-
dependent of rout as rout → ∞. However they usually contain
more AMD and thus grow less rapidly than the lowest-order con-
ﬁned mode. Global retrograde modes will depend on our choice of
rout.

9 CONCLUSION

In this paper we have formulated a system of linear equations gov-
erning the evolution of small eccentricities in systems consisting of
one or more planet coupled to a gaseous disc through secular and
resonant interactions. We have applied this formalism to the prob-
lem of a planet orbiting in the cavity of a protoplanetary disc, under
the inﬂuence of various physical effects.

The inclusion of 3D effects allows for the existence of an ec-
centric mode trapped in the inner parts of the disc. The existence
of this mode is very robust over a large range of parameters. The
distribution of AMD in this mode allows for a rapid growth rate,
compared with 2D models. For a wide range of disc and planet pa-
rameters, an eccentric mode can grow in the disc on a timescale
smaller than the disc’s lifetime, although usually beyond the scope
of current direct numerical simulations of disc–planet systems.

We ﬁnd that allowing for a ﬁnite resonant width and shifting
the resonance away from its nominal radius leads to several ELRs
operating in the disc. It is mostly the 2:4 and 3:5 ELRs that dom-
inate the growth rate, with a small contribution from the 4:6. The
1:3 ELR is found to have little impact on the growth rate, because
of its small amplitude. The only ECR that signiﬁcantly contributes
to the damping of eccentricity is the 1:2. Other ECRs might be
present in the disc if the planet orbits closer to the inner edge, but
we ﬁnd that eccentricity readily grows nonetheless, because of the
presence of several ELRs. This suggests that, even when the coro-
tation resonances are not saturated, eccentricity can grow even for
Jupiter-mass planets. If such growth was not observed in some nu-
merical simulations, it is most likely because it occurs on (at least)

thousands of orbital periods of the planet. In addition, growth in
the disc occurs more rapidly than in the planet, and it is not clear
whether the disc’s eccentricity will undergo a nonlinear saturation,
and how would it affect the planet.

We have compared our results with those of Rice et al. (2008).
For the same unrealistically massive disc, we also ﬁnd that an
eccentric mode can grow, which is dominated by the planet.
Rice et al. (2008) argued that the growth rates could be scaled down
linearly with the disc mass, and that massive planets could there-
fore experience eccentricity growth within the disc lifetime. How-
ever we caution that when scaling down the system, one enters the
regime where the growth of eccentricity is dominated by a disc
mode whose growth is much more rapid than the planet-dominated
mode (Fig. 14). It is not clear what the outcome of disc–planet in-
teractions could be for a system with an eccentric disc.

In this paper we have not considered planets orbiting in a gap,
such as that created by massive planets undergoing type-II migra-
tion. This is because the gap proﬁle is not easy to model in such
case, and should evolve in time as the planet migrates. In addition,
the planet is supposed to undergo type-II migration on a timescale
that can be comparable to the growth rate of eccentricity. The as-
sumption of a constant semi-major axis that is made here may no
longer be a good approximation, and the contribution from the in-
ner and outer discs will change as the planet comes closer to the
star.

It remains to be understood how, as the disc–planet system
evolves in time, AMD is redistributed between the two compo-
nents. In the case where the disc contains most of the AMD, it
is possible that, as the it becomes more and more depleted, AMD
is given to the planet, allowing its eccentricity to grow. We remark
that the same mechanism could potentially allow for inclination
growth as well. This mechanism has important consequences, as
it dictates the orbital architecture of the planetary systems at the
beginning of the gas-free stage of planetary evolution.

The angular velocity correction at O(ǫ2) is given by equation (A6)
at O(ǫ2),

A1 Linear theory in a three-dimensional inviscid disc

The derivation of the eccentricity equation is similar to that for the
2D inviscid disc as described by Goodchild & Ogilvie (2006). In
cylindrical polar coordinates (r, φ, z), if the ﬂuid has velocity com-
ponents (u, v, w), density ρ, pressure p and orbits in a gravitational
potential Φ, then the ﬂuid equations are

We assume in this derivation that the disc is locally isothermal and
therefore has the equation of state
p = c2
where the locally isothermal sound speed cs(r) is a function of the
radial coordinate only. This equation can be justiﬁed physically if
the temperature of the disc is determined by the radiation of the
central star, and any excess is rapidly radiated away by the disc.

(A5)

s ρ,

In the basic state, representing a steady, circular disc, the ve-
locity is (u, v, w) = (0, rΩ(r, z), 0), and the density is ρ(r, z).
Therefore equations (A1) and (A3) become

To solve these equations, each quantity is expanded as an asymp-
totic series in a small parameter ǫ2 ≪ 1, as in Ogilvie (2001). Here
ǫ represents a characteristic value of H/r, where H(r) is the semi-
thickness of the disc. Each quantity X is then written as
X = ǫs(X0 + X2ǫ2 + · · · ),
where the parameter s is chosen in each case to provide appropriate
scaling for the various quantities.

(A8)

In a system of units such as r and Ω are O(1), the sound speed
is O(ǫ), so we write cs = ǫcs0. We use a new coordinate ζ to
describe the vertical structure of the disc, where z = ǫζ so that
ζ = O(1) within the disc. The potential can be split into two com-
ponents, Φ∗ due to the central star and Φp,d due to the planet and
the disc. As Φ∗ is much larger than Φp,d, the latter is taken formally
to be of O(ǫ2). Using equation (A6) at O(1) gives the usual expres-
sion for the Keplerian angular velocity Ω0 = (GM∗/r3)1/2, and
we can use this to write the series for Φ∗ = −GM∗(r2 + z2)−1/2,

Φ∗ = −r2Ω2

We then introduce perturbed quantities

ℜ[X ′(r, z, t)e−iφ] for the velocity, density and potential. The an-

Since we are interested in the evolution of the disc on a
timescale much longer than the orbital timescale, all time deriva-
tives are assumed to be of O(ǫ2), so that ∂t 7→ ǫ2∂T with a slow
time variable T . The perturbed quantities can be expanded as se-
ries in ǫ2 in the same way as the steady-state quantities, with u′,
v′ and ρ′ being O(1) while w′ is O(ǫ) (we note that the overall
normalization of the perturbations in a linear theory is arbitrary).
Considering equations (A13) and (A14) at O(1) we have, as in
Goodchild & Ogilvie (2006), a general solution allowing veloci-
ties that describe a small eccentric perturbation expressed using the

The complex eccentricity could also depend on the vertical coordi-
nate, but we neglect this possibility here. Physically, this requires a
shear viscosity or some kind of stress to link the ellipses at different
heights together (Latter & Ogilvie 2006).

In order to ﬁnd an equation describing the slow time-evolution
of the eccentricity, we consider equations (A13) and (A14) at
O(ǫ2). This expression includes the vertical velocity perturbation
w′
0, so ﬁrst an expression for this needs to be found. Substituting
for u′

an expression for the density perturbation,

By taking a linear combination of equations (A13) and (A14)

to eliminate Ω2, ρ′

A2 The perturbing potential

In a prototplanetary disc, the gravitational potential deviates from
that of a point mass because of the presence of the planet(s) and
the disc. We ﬁrst derive the orbital-averaged perturbing potential
arising from a planet. The result can then be extended to derive the
potential arising from the disc, by treating the latter as a collection
of annuli of matter. We evaluate the potential in the midplane z = 0
since this is equivalent to the lowest-order term in ǫ2 which is the
only one to enter the eccentricity equation.

The orbit-averaged potential of a planet can be calculated
using the Gauss averaging method (see, e.g., Murray & Dermott
1999) in which the planet is smeared out along its orbit in such
way that the mass along any part of the orbit is proportional to the
time taken to traverse that part. If the planet is located at coordi-
nates (rp, φp) then the averaged potential is

(cid:27)σp dl,

(A23)

where σp is the line density for the planet and dl is the line element
along the orbit. In this expression, the ﬁrst term is the direct term
due to the planet’s gravity and the second is the indirect term due to
the fact that the coordinate origin is not at the center of mass. The
planet follows a Keplerian orbit with orbital elements (ap, ep, ̟p).
We have:

rp =

ap(1 − e2
p)

1 + ep cos(̟p − φp)

.

(A24)

Since equal masses are traversed in equal times, and by Kepler’s
second law dφp/ dt ∝ r−2

p , the mass element is given by

σp dl =

where the ﬁrst integral is carried over the radial extent of the disc.
To evaluate the effect of self-gravity in the disc we need to insert
the density distribution in the disc, taking into account the density
perturbation given by equation (A18). When this is integrated ver-
tically the second term vanishes and we are left with an overall
surface density

Σ(r, φ) = Σ0(r) + ℜ(cid:20)r

correct to ﬁrst order. The ﬁrst term of this expression contributes
to the axisymmetric potential Φp,d, while the second contributes to
the potential perturbation Φ′
p,d in equation (A22). The axisymmet-
ric term is easy to evaluate in terms of Laplace coefﬁcients,

Φd = −Z πGΣ(r′)b(0)

1/2(cid:16) r

r′(cid:17) dr′.

The second term can be integrated by parts if the boundary condi-
tions are such that ρE vanishes at the edges of the disc. Then we
ﬁnd

d =Z πGΣ(r′)E(r′)(cid:18)1 + r′ ∂

∂r′(cid:19) b(1)

1/2 dr′.

With β = r/r′ these are the continuous version of equation
(A27) and (A28), which can be recovered by setting Σ(r) =
(Mp/2πap)δ(r − ap)

A similar equation can be obtain for the evolution of the com-
plex eccentricity of the planet. This can be achieved by considering
once again the planet as an elliptical ring, equivalent to an annulus
of the disc. In equation (A29) the role of the annulus of disc matter
at radius r and the planet at distance ap can be inverted: Simply ap-
ply the transformation (r, Ω, Σ, E) ↔ (ap, Ωp, (Mp/2πap)δ(r −
ap), Ep) to all quantities in equation (A29), and integrate over the
radial extent of the disc, to obtain equation (11) before smoothing
is introduced.

A general method for deriving the rates of change of the complex
eccentricities of the disc and planet due to a mean-motion res-
onance was derived in Ogilvie (2007). From equations (99) and
(101) of that paper we ﬁnd that the local growth rates due to an

to the local vortencity gradient of the disc, and we obtain by a simi-

functions of radius.

(C25)

A = 2Σr3Ω

B = aP r3,

C = br2 dP
dr

+ crP

(D2)

(D3)

(D4)

(C26)

In 2D we have a = γ, b = 1 and c = 0. In 3D we have a =
2 − γ−1, b = 4 − 3γ−1 and c = 3(1 + γ−1).

In the isothermal case the transformation is achieved by mul-
s to get Equation (D1) with

tiplying Equation (3) or (4) by 2r/c2

As in the adiabatic case, resonances, self-gravity and gravita-
tional interactions with a planet simply add real or complex terms
to G, and the problem can still be formulated as a Sturm-Liouville
equation. It is worth noting that when viscosity is included, it is not
possible to formulate the problem in the form of a Sturm-Liouville
equation. The locally isothermal discretized model with viscosity
reads

where δ3D = 0 in 2D and δ3D = 1 in 3D. We note that the way
we have written the isothermal evolution equation here is different
from the one we used for the discretization method (Eq. C18), but
both formulations are equivalent.

In order to rewrite Equation (D1) into a Schrödinger equation,

we transform r and E to a new independent variable x(r) and a
new dependent variable Ψ(x) such that

The solution presented in this appendix is a generalisation of
that of Section 5.1. The effect of a planet or short-range forces can
easily be included in Equation (D13). However we ﬁnd that the
solution we present here does not signiﬁcantly affect the shape of
the effective potential well, and hence the physical interpretation
remains the same.
