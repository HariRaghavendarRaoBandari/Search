AN ULTRAMASSIVE 1.28 M⊙ WHITE DWARF IN NGC 20991

Draft version March 3, 2016

ABSTRACT

With the Keck I Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer we have observed nine white dwarf candi-
dates in the very rich open cluster NGC 2099 (M37). The spectroscopy shows seven to be DA white
dwarfs, one to be a DB white dwarf, and one to be a DZ white dwarf. Three of these DA white
dwarfs are consistent with singly evolved cluster membership: an ultramassive (1.28+0.05
−0.08 M⊙) and
two intermediate-mass (0.70 and 0.75 M⊙) white dwarfs. Analysis of their cooling ages allows us to
calculate their progenitor masses and establish new constraints on the initial-ﬁnal mass relation. The
intermediate-mass white dwarfs are in strong agreement with previous work over this mass regime.
The ultramassive white dwarf has V = 24.5, ∼2 mag fainter than the other two remnants. The
spectrum of this star has lower quality, so the derived stellar properties (e.g., Teﬀ , log g) have uncer-
tainties that are several times higher than the brighter counterparts. We measure these uncertainties
and establish the star’s ﬁnal mass as the highest-mass white dwarf discovered thus far in a cluster, but
we are unable to calculate its progenitor mass because at this high mass and cooler Teﬀ its inferred
cooling age is highly sensitive to its mass. At the highest temperatures, however, this sensitivity of
cooling age to an ultramassive white dwarf’s mass is only moderate. This demonstrates that future
investigations of the upper-mass end of the initial-ﬁnal mass relation must identify massive, newly
formed white dwarfs (i.e., in young clusters with ages 50-150 Myr).

1. INTRODUCTION

White dwarfs that are members of well-studied star
clusters are extremely valuable for understanding the
process of stellar evolution and mass loss. The progeni-
tor masses (hereafter Minitial) of these white dwarfs can
be calculated by comparing the remnant’s cooling age
to the cluster age, a technique that has now led to a
well established initial-ﬁnal mass relation (IFMR) from
Minitial = 0.8 to 5 M⊙ (e.g., Claver et al. 2001; Dobbie
et al. 2004, 2006a; Williams et al. 2004; Kalirai et al.
2005; Liebert et al. 2005; Williams & Bolte 2007; Kalirai
et al. 2007; Kalirai et al. 2008; Rubin et al. 2008; Kalirai
et al. 2009; Williams et al. 2009; Dobbie et al. 2012;
Cummings et al. 2015, hereafter Paper I; Cummings
et al. 2016, hereafter Paper II). At higher white dwarf
masses (hereafter Mﬁnal), the relation remains poorly
constrained. The progenitors of these massive white
dwarfs are intermediate-mass stars that quickly evolve to
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, which lose mass
through dust driven outﬂows and thermal pulses. This
phase of stellar evolution is poorly understood from ﬁrst

principles and is diﬃcult to model through direct obser-
vations. New constraints on the IFMR in this regime
would be a breakthrough for stellar astrophysics.

Finding and characterizing high-mass white dwarfs is
longstanding challenge due to their scarcity. In the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey and Palomar Green Survey only 1.5%
and 2.6%, respectively, of the ﬁeld white dwarfs have a
Mﬁnal≥1.05 M⊙ (e.g., Kleinman et al. 2013; Kepler et al.
2016; Liebert et al. 2005). In star clusters their number
remains limited at six. A long known high-mass white
dwarf is LB 1497 from the young Pleiades star cluster at
1.05 M⊙ (Gianninas et al. 2011). The remaining ﬁve have
been recently discovered: NGC 2287-4 (Dobbie et al.
2012), NGC 2168-LAWDS27 (Williams et al. 2009), two
white dwarfs in NGC 2323 (Paper II), and VPHASJ1103-
5837 in NGC 3532 (Raddi et al. 2016). VPHASJ1103-
5837 has a Mﬁnal∼1.13 M⊙ and the four others all have a
Mﬁnal∼1.07 M⊙ (Paper II). Two special cases are GD50
at 1.25±0.02 M⊙ and PG 0136+251 at 1.19±0.03 M⊙,
which are ultramassive white dwarfs with possible con-
nection to the Pleiades. Based on GD50’s space motion,
Dobbie et al. (2006b) ﬁnd a high probability it is coeval
with the young Pleiades and that it was ejected from
the cluster. Similar analysis of PG 0136+251 ﬁnds pro-
visional connections to the Pleiades based on its proper
motion, but its radial velocity is still needed to verify this
connection (Dobbie et al. 2006b). The scarcity of massive
white dwarfs in the Galactic ﬁeld, but even more so in
stellar clusters, has led to arguments that most massive
white dwarfs are formed through mass transfer or white
dwarf mergers, which theoretically can form such massive
white dwarfs (e.g., Dan et al. 2014). These merger pro-
cesses may create excess massive white dwarfs in the ﬁeld
but would not yet play a signiﬁcant role in the younger
cluster populations.

Cummings et al.

There are several reasons, however, that can explain
this scarcity besides the challenge that their progeni-
tors (Minitial > 6 M⊙) are rare. These include that:
(1) Increasingly higher-mass white dwarfs become more
compact under their strong gravities, which gives them
signiﬁcantly smaller radii and luminosity in compari-
son to their lower-mass companions.
(2) These white
dwarfs form from rapidly evolving higher-mass stars,
which means that in most clusters they have already
undergone signiﬁcant cooling, further limiting their vis-
ibility. (3) High-mass white dwarfs may be prone to be
ejected from their parent clusters, either due to dynam-
ical interactions or velocity kicks resulting from asym-
metric mass loss during their formation (Fellhauer et al.
2003; Tremblay et al. 2012).

Our search for ultramassive white dwarfs begins with
the very rich NGC 2099 with a large population of 50
white dwarf candidates (e.g., Kalirai et al. 2001; 2005;
Paper I). In Paper I we spectroscopically conﬁrmed the
white dwarf nature of 19 of the brighter white dwarf can-
didates in the cluster and measured their masses. That
work set the bulk of the constraints on the intermediate
mass range of the IFMR (e.g., Minitial = 2.5 to 4.0 M⊙).
In this letter, we push the initial study to fainter lumi-
nosities in search of more massive white dwarfs.

In Section 2 we discuss the spectroscopic white dwarf
observations of NGC 2099 and describe the reduction
and analysis techniques. In Section 3 we discuss the clus-
ter membership of the white dwarf candidates in NGC
2099. In Section 4 we look at the Minitial and Mﬁnal of
each white dwarf cluster member and analysis in detail
the errors of ultramassive white dwarfs. In Section 5 we
summarize our results.

2. OBSERVATIONS, REDUCTIONS & ANALYSIS

Our previous Keck I Low Resolution Imaging Spec-
trometer (LRIS; Oke et al. 1995) observations of NGC
2099, presented in Paper I, observed a faint candidate
(WD33) at V = 24.49±0.065. The resulting WD33 spec-
trum was not suitable for publication, but it suggested
that this faint white dwarf had a high mass. We ob-
tained new Keck/LRIS observations during 2015 Febru-
ary 18 and 19 with a slitmask to re-observe WD33 and
eight new white dwarf candidates in NGC 2099. These
additional eight targets span V from 22.3 to 24.3 and
were selected based on the 11 white dwarfs in Paper I
that were found to be consistent with NGC 2099 mem-
bership. Five hours of observation were acquired on this
mask.

Continuing with the methods from Paper I and II, we
reduced and ﬂux calibrated the new LRIS observations
using the IDL based XIDL pipeline7. Of the total ob-
served sample of nine white dwarf candidates, seven are
DA white dwarfs, one is a DB white dwarf, and one is a
DZ white dwarf. The new observations of WD33 have
been coadded to the original observations taken with
Keck/LRIS under the same conﬁguration.

For the spectroscopic DA analysis, we adopted the
same techniques as described in Paper II but with up-
dated oxygen/neon (ONe) white dwarf models. In brief,
we used the white dwarf spectroscopic models of Trem-
blay et al. (2011) with the Stark proﬁles of Tremblay &

7 Available at http://www.ucolick.org/∼xavier/IDL/

Bergeron (2009), and the automated ﬁtting techniques
from Bergeron et al. (1992) to ﬁt the Balmer line spec-
tra and derive Teﬀ and log g. For the spectroscopic
DB analysis, we adopted the methods in Bergeron et al.
(2011). For deriving Mﬁnal, luminosity, and cooling age
of the lower mass (<1.10 M⊙) DA white dwarfs and the
DB white dwarf, the cooling models by Fontaine et al.
(2001) were used for a carbon/oxygen (CO) core compo-
sition with a thick and thin hydrogen layer, for hydrogen
and helium atmospheres, respectively. Lastly, for mas-
sive white dwarfs up to 1.28 M⊙ we derived Mﬁnal, lu-
minosity, and cooling age based on the ONe-core models
of Althaus et al. (2007), up to 1.38 M⊙ we used un-
published ultramassive models using consistent physics
(L.G. Althaus; private communication 2016). This both
expands the mass range and updates our adopted ONe
mass-radius relationship to that from the Althaus et al.
(2007) models. In contrast, the Paper II analysis used
the older mass-radius relationship from Althaus et al.
(2005).

Table 1 presents the observed and derived parameters
for the new white dwarf candidates from NGC 2099. We
have organized these white dwarfs by type and member-
ship (see Section 3), but we also separate the DZ WD26
because we cannot analyze it and WD30, WD31, and
WD32 because they have very low S/N spectra with mass
uncertainties >0.1 M⊙. Their membership analysis is
unreliable so we did not use them in the IFMR.

and PG 0136+251 (Gianninas et al. 2011).
The
spectroscopic analysis techniques in both studies were
equivalent to ours, so we applied their Teﬀ and log
g directly (we added external errors [see Paper I] to
VPHASJ1103-5837’s published errors), and we derived
both the masses and cooling ages from the ONe models
of Althaus et al. (2007).

3. WHITE DWARF MEMBERSHIP IN NGC 2099

To apply these white dwarfs to the IFMR, cluster mem-
bership must be veriﬁed to be able to infer their Minitial.
For WD33, the signiﬁcant mass and high Teﬀ is by it-
self a strong argument for membership, but to reﬁne its
membership and determine the membership status of the
other observed white dwarfs we compared the predicted
colors and magnitudes to the photometry (see Table 1).
This is similar to the procedure from Paper I, where
we compared to the NGC 2099 photometry from Kali-
rai et al. (2001), but we now have an expanded sample
and color range to both reﬁne the white dwarf based dis-
tance modulus and reddening and to also look for trends
with color.

Figure 1 compares the apparent distance moduli and
reddenings for each observed white dwarf with suﬃcient
signal and plots them versus their model-based predicted
color. Their 1σ distance modulus and reddening errors
are shown, which are the photometric and model-based
errors added in quadrature. In both cases, we ﬁnd color
trends for distance modulus and reddening. These trends
may be the result of the photometric standardization,
which can be less precise in both blue stars and in faint
stars. Additionally, the reddening in NGC 2099 is quite
large, and as discussed in Paper I (see also Fernie et al.

with single star membership in NGC 2099 because they
are within 2σ of the trend in both distance modulus and
reddening.

Fig. 3.— The IFMR data from Paper I and II (gray) are plotted with the three newly observed members of NGC 2099 (black). WD25
and WD28 are strongly consistent with the previous data, while the ultramassive WD33 gives a very low Minitial but with signiﬁcant mass
errors (1σ-black; 2σ-red). Because the initial and ﬁnal mass errors in WD33 are not independent, we also display a curve showing the
direct and strong relation between adopted Mﬁnal and the resulting Minitial. We also include VPHASJ1103-5837 and the updated Pleiades
white dwarfs. The ﬁt relation displayed does not consider WD33 due to its signiﬁcant errors.

WD27 is 0.84±0.17 magnitudes too bright to be con-
sistent with single star membership. However, if it is
a binary member of two comparable luminosity white
dwarfs its observed magnitude would be ∼0.75 magni-
tudes brighter than the model predicts. The inferred red-
dening of this DB white dwarf is ∼2σ lower than expected
for a member, which may suggest it is a less-reddened
foreground DB white dwarf, but it is still within the red-
dening membership criterion. Additionally, its younger
cooling age of 204 Myr is well within the NGC 2099 clus-
ter age of 520±50 Myr (Kalirai et al. 2001; Paper I). How-
ever, we note the unlikelihood of a binary with two nearly
equivalent DB white dwarfs and the lack of Balmer fea-
tures in the spectrum (see Figure 2) that would indicate
a DA companion.
Irrespective of membership, WD27
is an interesting and very rare DB because it is both
moderately hot and high mass (see Bergeron et al. 2011;
Koester & Kepler 2015).

Figure 2 displays the spectral ﬁts of the three white
dwarf members WD25, WD28, and WD33, and the DB
white dwarf WD27. While the WD33 spectrum has low
S/N, most notably at the two highest-order Balmer lines,
at this high mass and moderate Teﬀ these highest-order
lines become increasingly less sensitive to log g. For ex-
ample, ﬁtting only the ﬁrst four Balmer lines derives log
g=9.23±0.22 and only the ﬁrst three lines derives log
g=9.30±0.24. Lastly, spectral analysis of 831 synthetic
spectra with input parameters of Teﬀ=32,900 K and log
g=9.27 and S/N=22 ﬁnds a normally distributed series
of log g measurements with a mean consistent with the
input, and the distribution’s σ matches our spectral anal-
ysis’s ﬁtting error.

4.

INITIAL-FINAL MASS RELATION

We measured the IFMR by comparing each white
dwarf’s cooling age to the NGC 2099 cluster age (520
Myr). The diﬀerence between these ages gives the evolu-
tionary time to the tip of the AGB for each white dwarf’s
progenitor. We applied these times to the PARSEC evo-
lutionary models (Bressan et al. 2012) to determine each
white dwarf’s Minitial. These Minitial values are given in
Table 1, including two Minitial errors based on the white
dwarf parameter errors and from the cluster age errors
(520±50 Myr). For the Minitial of VPHASJ1103-5837
we adopted for NGC 3532 the Paper II cluster age of
320 Myr. For GD50 and PG 0136+251 we adopted for
Pleiades the Paper II cluster age of 135 Myr.

Beginning with the high-mass DB white dwarf WD27,
if WD27 is a double degenerate consistent with cluster
membership it may have undergone some level of binary
interaction in its past. This could potentially explain
its nature, but this would also make its inferred Minitial
unreliable. Testing this, its relatively short cooling time
of 204+39
−0.12 M⊙,
while our IFMR ﬁt gives that a singly evolved 1.0 M⊙
white dwarf would have a ∼5.0 M⊙ progenitor.

−34 Myr implies a Minitial of only 3.46+0.16

Figure 3 compares the Paper I and II IMFR data
with VPHASJ1103-5837, the updated Pleiades white
dwarfs, and the three newly observed NGC 2099 mem-
bers. WD25, WD28, VPHASJ1103-5837, PG 0136+251,
and GD50 are strongly consistent with the Paper II
IFMR trend. The ultramassive WD33, however, is very
discrepant, but there are several possible explanations
for this. First, is it a supermassive white dwarf formed
through a merger of two lower-mass white dwarfs? Based
on the models of white dwarf mergers from Dan et al.
(2014), the mechanism to create a stable supermassive

time to still cool for 233 Myr.

Lastly, another possibility relates to both the analysis
and systematic errors in the ONe cooling models them-
selves. The errors in black in Figure 3 are the 1σ errors
in both Mﬁnal and Minitial. Expanding our error anal-
ysis in WD33 to look at 2σ variations in log g (in red)
ﬁnds that at higher masses the uncertainty in the cooling
age rapidly expands. This results from a white dwarf’s
radius becoming increasingly sensitive to mass in this
regime (Althaus et al. 2005; 2007). Figure 4 displays the
Althaus et al. (2007) mass-radius relationship at WD33’s
Teﬀ of 32,900 K. This mass sensitivity in radius also leads
to a signiﬁcant sensitivity in log g, cooling age, and lumi-
nosity at higher masses. In Figure 4, we also analyze the
sensitivity to WD33’s 1σ Teﬀ error (1100 K) for cooling
age and luminosity, with a high-Teﬀ (blue) and low-Teﬀ
(red) curve. This illustrates that at the highest masses
the sensitivity of the cooling age to Teﬀ errors is minor
relative to the mass dependence.

In application to the ultramassive IFMR, one advan-
tage of these strong dependencies is that large errors in
the spectroscopically derived log g result in only moder-
ate to minor errors in Mﬁnal. A second advantage is that
the increasing sensitivity of luminosity to Mﬁnal can be
used to independently infer mass from photometry, but
uncertainties in WD33’s observed magnitude and NGC
2099’s visual distance modulus currently limit how accu-
rately we can observationally derive its MV.

The signiﬁcant challenge for the ultramassive IFMR
is the extreme sensitivity to Mﬁnal of cooling age, and
hence Minitial. As seen in Table 1 and Figure 4, WD33’s
parameters only derive a modest cooling age of 233 Myr,
and with the adopted cluster age of 520 Myr this gives
a very low Mﬁnal of 3.58 M⊙. A 1σ increase in WD33’s
mass to 1.33 M⊙ increases the derived cooling age to 331
Myr. While a 2σ increase in white dwarf mass, from
propagating a 2σ increase in log g, to 1.36 M⊙ increases
the cooling age to 546 Myr, surpassing the cluster age.
Figure 3 demonstrates this strong dependence of initial
and ﬁnal mass errors with a single curve passing through
WD33. This also illustrates the additional challenge that
as Minitial increases the sensitivity of derived Minitial to
evolutionary lifetime increases rapidly.

These cooling age challenges, reassuringly, do not
equally aﬀect all ultramassive white dwarfs.
The
youngest and hottest white dwarfs in this mass range
are signiﬁcantly less susceptible to these complications
(e.g., GD50). First, these young white dwarfs are higher
luminosity, increasing the ease of acquiring high-signal
spectra. Second, the sensitivity of cooling age on white
dwarf mass signiﬁcantly decreases at high Teﬀ. For ex-
ample, at WD33’s Teﬀ of 32,900 K, a decrease in Mﬁnal
from 3.36 to 3.34 M⊙ causes a 191 Myr decrease in in-
ferred cooling age. For a young white dwarf at Teﬀ of
65,000 K, this same change in Mﬁnal would result in a
decrease in inferred cooling age of 37 Myr (see full com-
parison in Figure 4). A third advantage for young and
ultramassive white dwarfs is that cooling ages are further
complicated by dependencies on both the input physics
and composition in the adopted cooling model, where
potential systematics introduced in the cooling age grow
rapidly with increasing cooling age.

Fig. 4.— These panels illustrate how log radius, log g, cooling
age, and log L/L⊙ vary with Mﬁnal at constant Teﬀ in the ONe
models of Althaus et al. (2007) plus consistent higher-mass mod-
els. Green represents the derived Teﬀ of WD33 at 32,900 K. The
lower two panels illustrate the eﬀects of the ±1100 K Teﬀ errors
by plotting 34,000 K (blue) and 31,800 K (red). The cooling age
at 1.38 M⊙ is not displayed but is 1168+114
−101 Myr. For cooling age,
we also illustrate the weakened sensitivity to mass at a higher Teﬀ
of 65,000 K (black).

white dwarf requires the merging of two comparable
white dwarfs of approximately half its mass (∼0.64 M⊙).
Based on the age of NGC 2099 this is pushing the mini-
mum mass of a white dwarf that could have formed after
520 Myr. Binary interactions could have aﬀected their
evolutionary timescales, but they still would have likely
just formed in the recent past and would not have had
the time to both merge to create WD33 and subsequently
cool for 233 Myr.

Second, WD33 could be the result of a binary merger
event that occurred while the components were still
evolving. Two binary components of both ∼3.5 M⊙
could have undergone interaction and subsequent merger.
This would have created a short-lived ∼7 M⊙ blue strag-
gler that quickly formed into WD33 and had suﬃcient

5. SUMMARY

We have observed nine new white dwarf candidates in
NGC 2099. Two intermediate-mass (WD25, WD28) and
one ultramassive (WD33) DA white dwarfs were found
to be consistent with membership. We also compared
to the self-consistently analyzed GD50, PG 0136+251,
and the newly discovered VPHASJ1103-5837. Applica-
tion of these data to the IFMR ﬁnds strong consistency
with our previous work for all but WD33, but this may
be explained by WD33’s signiﬁcant Minitial errors. Ac-
quiring additional spectroscopic signal on WD33 may be
of interest, and more accurate photometry would also be
useful, but overcoming these errors at this mass and Teﬀ
currently may not be viable at V=24.49. For precise
application of ultramassive white dwarfs to the IFMR,
future studies should focus on clusters of age ∼50 to 150

Myr. Nevertheless, because GD50 and PG 0136+251 are
only kinematically connected to the Pleiades, WD33 is
the ﬁrst ultramassive white dwarf that is photometrically
consistent with membership in a star cluster.
