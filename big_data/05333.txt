Existence of Projective Planes

Xander Perrott

March 18, 2016

Abstract

This report gives an overview of the history of ﬁnite projective planes
and their properties before going on to outline the proof that no projective
plane of order 10 exists. The report also investigates the search carried
out by MacWilliams, Sloane and Thompson in 1970 [12] and conﬁrms
their result by providing independent veriﬁcation that there is no vector
of weight 15 in the code generated by the projective plane of order 10.

Introduction

This report introduces the concept of projective planes and gives an under-
standing of their properties. Section 2 details the history of research into the
existence of projective planes including an overview of the search for the projec-
tive plane of order 10. This is developed further in Section 3 where we outline
the method and theory used in the search for the projective plane of order 10.
Finally, Section 4 details how A15 was shown to be 0 and gives the results of an
independent search for code words of weight 15.

1.1 Properties of Projective Planes

Projective planes were deﬁned in order to develop the notion of a plane to
include the additional property that any two distinct lines should have a unique
intersection point. At this point we are thinking of a plane as a ﬂat surface
of two dimensions and a line as being a one dimensional subspace that is
embedded in this plane, but we should redeﬁne lines as sets of points contained
in the plane. In a plane which is not projective two lines can be parallel and
each contain a distinct set of points. They do not have a point in common at
which they intersect. In a projective plane we will ensure that for every pair of
distinct lines there is exactly one point that belongs to both.

Example 1. The Euclidean plane is not a projective plane as we can ﬁnd pairs
of parallel lines, e.g. x = 0 and x = 1. We can create a projective plane by
starting with the Euclidean plane and adding points to make sure every distinct
pair of lines has a unique intersection. Currently a set of lines with the same
gradient are all parallel to each other and do not intersect so we take all the
lines of a particular gradient, called a parallel class, and add the same point

1

to each of them. Now all of the lines of the parallel class intersect at this new
point. This new point does not lie on the in the plane and is called a ‘point at
inﬁnity’. We add a point at inﬁnity for every parallel class so there are now an
inﬁnite number, one for every value the gradient could take and then add one
additional line which contains every point at inﬁnity and is known as the ‘line
at inﬁnity’. Now the plane is a projective plane as all pairs of distinct lines
have a single intersection point, there are only three cases to check.
1. Two distinct lines which are not parallel (and neither is the line at inﬁnity)
have one intersection in the Euclidean plane as before.
2. Two distinct lines which are parallel meet on the line at inﬁnity as they are
in the same parallel class.
3. The line at inﬁnity and any other line meet in a point on the line at inﬁnity
as every line belongs to some parallel class and therefore has one point on the
line at inﬁnity. Note that by adding the line at inﬁnity we have retained the
important property of planes that any two points of the plane are both contained
in a line of the plane.

It is natural for us to choose to extend the Euclidean plane in this way since it is
the plane we are most familiar with. However, it is not particularly manageable
since it has an inﬁnite number of points and lines. In order to gain further under-
standing about projective planes we need to ﬁnd planes with ﬁnite numbers of
points and lines. By limiting the projective plane to a ﬁnite, but nontrivial size
we get an interesting result; the number of lines that pass through each point
is equal and furthermore is equal to the number of points that are contained in
each line. This can be seen by considering a point p, contained in k lines in a
projective plane. From our requirement that the plane is nontrivial we assume
there exists a quadrangle, a set of four points where no three are contained in
one line. Thus we can take l, a line that doesn’t contain p, and each of the k
lines through p must intersect l in exactly one point. Each of the k points of
intersection must be distinct as the lines already have a unique intersection at
p so l contains at least k points. If l contains more than k points then there is
some point, x, on l that is not on one of the k lines. This is not possible as it
suggests there is no line containing p and x, a contradiction to the properties of
planes. Now consider a point, q, also not on the line l, and then there must be
k lines containing q paired with each of the k lines of l. Any more than k lines
containing q would suggest that the additional lines do not intersect l; again, a
contradiction. Repeating this argument for all points and lines gives the result.

This gives us an easy way of classifying ﬁnite projective planes based on their
size.
Deﬁnition 2. A projective plane of order n where n ≥ 2 is a ﬁnite set of points
and lines (deﬁned as sets of points), such that:

1. Every line contains n + 1 points

2. Every point lies on n + 1 lines

3. Any two distinct lines intersect in a unique point

4. Any two distinct points lie on a unique line.

2

This deﬁnition is the same under duality meaning that if we change statements
into their dual statements then the deﬁnition is unchanged. A dual statement
is achieved by switching words relating to lines such as ‘line’, ‘intersect’ and
‘contains’ with an appropriate choice of word relating to points, ‘point’ and
‘lies’. This changes which statements are about lines and which are about points.

Example 3. The projective plane of order 2 (The Fano plane) is shown
here. There are seven lines (six straight and one curved) and seven points
with each line containing three (2 + 1) points and each point lying on three
lines. This also gives the plane a high degree of symmetry as by relabeling
the points it can be seen that all the lines are equivalent in the structure.
Additionally we can choose to view the points as lines of the plane and the lines
as points and the diagram still represents the same structure (by the duality
mentioned previously). The plane is said to be non-Euclidean as there is no way
to draw the conﬁguration in the Euclidean plane without the use of a curved line.

Lemma 4. In a projective plane of order n there are n2 + n + 1 points and
n2 + n + 1 lines.

Proof. Consider a projective plane of order n and take any point of the plane, p.
There are n+1 lines passing through p and each of these lines has n points other
than p on it. This accounts for all points in the plane since for any two distinct
points there must be a line containing both of them, therefore any point which
is not p must lie on a line that passes through p. Note also, if some point x lies
on more than one line passing through p (and would therefore be counted twice
in this method of counting the points) this would cause two lines through p to
intersect in two points, p and x, which contradicts our deﬁnition of a projective
plane. This means we have n + 1 lines times n points and the point p, resulting
in n(n + 1) + 1 = n2 + n + 1 points in the projective plane of order n. By duality
a similar argument can be made to show there are also n2 + n + 1 lines in the
projective plane of order n.

1.2

Incidence Matrices

Another way for us to view projective planes is as an incidence matrix. The
rows of the matrix correspond to lines of the plane and the columns correspond
to points in the plane so we need a matrix of size (n2 + n + 1) × (n2 + n + 1).
The matrix tells us which points are contained in each line and which lines lie

3

on each of the points. We deﬁne the entries of the matrix as

(cid:40)

Aij =

1
0

line i contains point j
otherwise

The incidence matrix needs to represent the structure of a projective plane of
order n so it should have have the properties:

1. Every row contains n + 1 ones

2. Every column contains n + 1 ones

3. Two distinct rows have exactly one column where they both have one as

an entry

4. Two distinct columns have exactly one row where they both have one as

an entry.

The existence of such a matrix of size (n2 + n + 1) × (n2 + n + 1) is equivalent
to the existence of a projective plane of order n.

Example 5. Shown below are two incidence matrices for the Fano plane. There
are multiple representations of any incidence matrix as there are many possible
ways to label the points and lines of the plane which changes the order of rows
and columns in the matrix. Naturally, the two matrices here are the same up
to switching rows or columns as there is only one representation of the Fano
plane excluding relabeling. Matrix A is an intuitive way of constructing the
incidence matrix by going through the points sequentially and listing all lines
on the point that have not yet been expressed in the matrix. Matrix B has a
nicer cyclic representation, but it is not possible to ﬁnd such a representation
for every ﬁnite projective plane.

These are incidence matrices for the Fano plane (order 2) so the number of
points and lines is n2 + n + 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 hence these are 7 × 7 matrices.
There are three ones in each row and column representing the fact that every
line contains three points and every point lies on three lines of the plane. Let u
and v be rows of the incidence matrix where u (cid:54)= v. Then u · v = 1 as there is
only one point in common on lines u and v. We also have v · v = 3 as all lines
have three points on them so taking the inner product of two of the same rows
gives three points where both lines have one as an entry. Thus we can deduce

AAT = 2I + J

where J is the 7 × 7 matrix with 1 for every entry, I is the identity matrix and
AT is the transpose of A. This is a direct result of the inner products we have

4

just calculated. On the main diagonal the values are the inner product of two
identical rows giving the value of three. Oﬀ the diagonal each entry is one since
we are taking the inner product of distinct rows. In general, where A is the
incidence matrix of the projective plane of order n

AAT = nI + J.

Something that will be of interest to us in a later section is the determinant of
A. Let C = nI + J so that AAT = C. Then we have

det(C) = det(AAT ) = det(A) · det(AT ) = (det(A))2.

Since we have a way of relating them it is easiest to ﬁnd det(A) by ﬁnding
det(C) ﬁrst. C is a (n2 + n + 1) × (n2 + n + 1) matrix with entries of n + 1 on
the diagonal and one everywhere else, therefore we can calculate the following:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = ±

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

The ﬁrst equality comes from subtracting the ﬁrst row from every other, an
operation which preserves the determinant. The second equality is the result of
adding every other column to the ﬁrst one. Again this operation does not change
the determinant. Note that the top left entry is given by (n + 1) + (n2 + n)· 1 =
n2 + 2n + 1 = (n + 1)2. Finally, the determinant can be equated by taking the
product of the diagonal elements of the last matrix since it is in upper triangular
form. Therefore

det(A) =(cid:112)det(C) = ±(n + 1)n(n2+n)/2.

det(C) = (n + 1)2nn2+n

1.3 Vector Spaces
Deﬁnition 6. Let A be a set of vectors, {a1, a2, . . . , an}. The vector space
generated by A over a ﬁeld F is given by

{x | x = f1a1 + f2a2 + ··· + fnan, fi ∈ F}.

We will be working in binary so F = Z/2Z = {0, 1} where 1 + 1 = 0. This
means that the generated vectors are actually the sum of a subset of vectors
from A. The reason we introduce vector spaces here is that we want to
consider the vector space generated by the rows of the incidence matrix of a
projective plane. Since the rows of the incidence matrix correspond to lines
of the projective plane we are actually looking for all conﬁgurations of points
which are the sum of lines of the plane. We can also call this vector subspace
a code and vectors in the code are called code words. We say a point is on
a conﬁguration if the entry of the code word corresponding to the point is a one.

5

Example 7. We can ﬁnd the binary code generated by the rows of the incidence
matrix for the projective plane of order 2 using matrix B above. Any vector
generated is a sum of rows in B so ﬁrst note that if we take the sum of the
empty set of rows we get the vector (0,0,0,0,0,0,0) in the code. Next consider
three lines which all pass through the same point, p. Adding these three rows
gives (1,1,1,1,1,1,1) since every point is on this conﬁguration of lines; p is on
three lines and every other point lies on a single line. One line conﬁgurations
contain three points as they are naturally the rows making up B, this gives us

{(1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0), . . . , (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)}.

Two line conﬁgurations contain four points since each line contains three points,
but they have one point of intersection, p. p therefore is not on the conﬁguration,
but the other two points on each line are giving four points in total. Additionally,
there is always a third line passing through p and the sum of all three lines is
(1,1,1,1,1,1,1) so the sum of two lines intersecting at p is always the complement
of the points on the third line through p. This gives us seven more vectors in
the vector space

{(0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1), . . . , (0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0)}.

Any third line added to the sum of two lines will either result in (1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
or another line of the plane. Thus any further addition of lines does not
generate anything beyond the 16 vectors we have found so they are only vectors
generated by the incidence matrix.

When we take the sum of a number of code words, a point a is on the resulting
code word if it was on an odd number of the summed conﬁgurations. Since each
entry of the code words is summed independently if a is in k of the summed
code words then the entry of a is given by k · 1 = k. If k is even then k = 0
(mod 2) and a is not on the conﬁguration whereas if k is odd then k = 1 (mod
2) so a is on the conﬁguration.

Deﬁnition 8. The weight of a code word v is the number of non-zero compo-
nents of the code word. It is denoted w(v).

This is equivalent to the number of ones in the code word since we are only
using a binary code. Therefore the weight of the code word is also the number
of points in the conﬁguration.

Example 9. If v = (1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0), w(v) = 3.
Lemma 10. Let C be a binary code and v, u ∈ C. Then
w(v + u) = w(v) + w(u) − 2w(v ∩ u).

Proof. Points that are in the intersection of v and u are on an even number of
summed conﬁgurations so are not in v + u. Points that are on either v or u

6

however are on the conﬁguration v + u. Thus we have

w(v + u) = w(v\u) + w(u\v)

= (w(v\u) + w(v ∩ u)) + (w(u\v) + w(u ∩ v)) − 2w(v ∩ u)
= w(v) + w(u) − 2w(v ∩ u).

Deﬁnition 11. The weight-enumerator polynomial of a code C is given by

N(cid:88)

WC(x, y) =

AixN−iyi

i=0

where N = n2 + n + 1 and Ai is the number of vectors of weight i in C.

Example 12. Continuing our example of the vector space V generated by the
incidence matrix of the Fano plane we want to ﬁnd its weight-enumerator poly-
nomial. Previously we saw that it has one weight zero vector, seven weight
three vectors corresponding to lines of the plane, seven weight four vectors rep-
resenting complements of lines and one weight seven vector. Using the previous
deﬁnition this gives us

WV (x, y) = x7 + 7x4y3 + 7x3y4 + y7.

2 History of Projective Planes

The concept of ﬁnite projective planes has been around since the very early
1900s [14].
It was of interest to mathematicians to determine the orders for
which planes could exist. The strongest proof of existence was that projective
planes of order n exist whenever n is a prime power i.e. for any n = pq, where
p is prime and q is an integer [7].

This left the projective plane of order 6 as the smallest whose existence was
unknown.
In the 1930s, Bose came up with a condition that if a projective
plane of order n exists then n − 1 orthogonal Latin squares of order n must
exist [2]. Euler [6] had been interested in orthogonal Latin squares in 1782
and created the 36 oﬃcer problem requiring two orthogonal Latin squares of
size 6 which he believed was unsolvable. He went on to theorise that for any
n = 2 (mod 4) orthogonal Latin squares of order n do not exist, but this was
only certain for n = 2 at the time. Euler’s conjecture has since been proven
false, but he was correct in thinking his 36 oﬃcer problem had no solution. In
1901, Tarry hand checked all Latin squares of order 6 to ﬁnd that no two were
mutually orthogonal, let alone ﬁve [13]. In conjunction with Bose’s result this
proved the non-existance of the projective plane of order 6.

The Bruck-Ryser Theorem [3] conﬁrmed this result, an improvement over
enumeration which is fallible. The theorem said that for n = 1, 2 (mod 4) a
projective plane of order n can only exist when n is the sum of two squares. As
six is not the sum of two squares the projective plane of order 6 must not exist.
This result however did not say anything about the existence of the projective
plane of order 10 as 10 = 32 + 12.

Searching for a projective plane of order 10 is equivalent to ﬁnding a suitable
111 × 111 incidence matrix, A, where AAT = 10I + J ensuring the properties
of projective planes hold. The reasoning and computer search that showed no
projective plane of order 10 existed began to take shape in the early 1970s.
Lam [8] explains that a talk given by Assmus introduced the concept of working
with vector spaces which increased interest in the problem. Maybe the code
space would return an easily reached contradiction proving non-existence.

The weight-enumerator polynomial
for the vector space generated by the
projective plane of order 10 was a natural construction as it gave information
about the structure of the plane. MacWilliams, Sloane and Thompson [12]
explain that Assmus’ article [1] and 1970 talk, along with unpublished reasoning
by Thompson, show that the weight-enumerator can be expressed in terms of
Ai for i = 12, 15 and 16. This means that once the numbers of vectors of
weight 12, 15 and 16 in the vector space are found the entire weight-enumerator
polynomial is known.

The ﬁrst of these to be calculated was A15, shown to be zero by MacWilliams,

8

Sloane and Thompson in an exhaustive computer search [12]. This was shown
again by Bruen and Fisher [4] using a diﬀerent method based on previous work
by Denniston [5]. In 1983, Lam, Thiel and Swiercz found that A12 = 0 [11] and
proceeded to ﬁnish the search for A16 started by Carter to demonstrate that
A16 was also zero [10].

Once A12, A15 and A16 were all known to be zero the weight-enumerator poly-
nomial could be calculated. It was seen that A0 = 0 and A11 = 111 as expected
and the next smallest non-zero vector weight is A19 = 24, 675. This means
that the incidence matrix for the projective plane of order 10 should be able
to be constructed starting with a 19 point conﬁguration. When Lam, Thiel
and Swiercz ruled out all such 19 point conﬁgurations as starting vectors in the
space [9] it proved that no incidence matrix could exist. Therefore the projective
plane of order 10 does not exist.

9

3 Speciﬁcs of the non-existence argument

In this section we will go through a more rigorous explanation of the method
that was used to show the projective plane of order 10 does not exist. We will
follow the structure of K˚arhstr¨om [7].

3.1 Theories of Projective Plane Codes

Whereas the properties of projective planes discussed in the introduction
applied to all orders, here we will present some more speciﬁc theories relating
to the projective plane of order 10.

Lemma 13. Let x be a code word of the code generated by a ﬁnite projective
plane of order 10. A line, l, of the projective plane intersects x in an odd number
of points if and only if x is a sum of an odd number of lines of the projective
plane.

Proof. First we consider the case where l is not one of the lines in x. Let x be
the sum of i lines where i is an odd number. As the line, l, intersects each of
the lines that sum to x precisely once, there are i intersections of l with lines
of x. Let j be the number of points on l where an odd number of lines of x
intersect and 11 − j be the number of points where an even number intersect.
Then i = 1 · j + 0 · (11 − j) (mod 2) so j must be odd. If an odd number of the
lines of x intersect l at a point a then a is in x since it is on an odd number of
lines of x. Similarly the points where an even number of lines of x intersect l
are not in x. Therefore the number of points where l intersects x is j which is
odd.

Retaining the same notation, if the number of places l intersects x is odd then
so is j, the number of points where an odd number of lines of x intersect l. The
equation i = 1 · j + 0 · (11 − j) tells us that i is also odd so x is the sum of an
odd number of lines.

Now let x be the sum of an odd number of lines including l. Then consider the
conﬁguration x − l which is the sum of an even number of lines. Since l is not
a line of x − l, l intersects x − l in an even number of points (from previous
case). Points of l that are on x − l lie on an odd number of lines in x − l, but
therefore lie on an even number of lines in x so are not in x. Similarly, points
of l that are not on x − l are on x. Therefore the points of l that intersect with
x are the complement of the points that intersect with x− l. As l has 11 points
the complement of an even number of points must be an odd number of points.
Note that if x is the sum of an even number of lines a similar argument shows
that the number of points in the intersection of x and l is even.

Lemma 14. The weights of code words in the code generated by the incidence
matrix for the projective plane of order 10 are 0 or 3 (mod 4) for even or odd
numbers of summed lines, respectively.

Proof. Start with the base case of the sum of zero lines from the incidence
matrix. This is the zero code word and has weight 0 (mod 4). Any single row of

10

the incidence matrix as a code word has weight 11 = 3 (mod 4). Now consider
adding a line l, to a code word x, that is the sum of an even number of lines of
the incidence matrix. The additional line will intersect the code word an even
number of times, 2p. Then the weight of the resulting code word has

w(x) + w(l) − 2 · 2p = 0 + 3 − 4p (mod 4) = 3 (mod 4).

If adding a line l to a code word x that is the sum of an odd number of lines,
then the line will intersect the code word in an odd number of points, 2p + 1.
Then the weight of the new code word is

w(x) + w(l) − 2(2p + 1) = 3 + 3 − 4p − 2 (mod 4) = 0 (mod 4).

This allows us to express the weight enumerator more neatly since we now have
A4i+1 = A4i+2 = 0 for all i. Therefore we get separate sums for conﬁgurations
of even weights and odd weights:

27(cid:88)

27(cid:88)

WC(x, y) =

A4ix111−4iy4i +

A4i+3x108−4iy4i+3.

i=0

Deﬁnition 15. For a code C the orthogonal dual code C⊥ is a code of the
same length as C deﬁned as

C⊥ = {x | ∀y ∈ C, y · x = 0 (mod 2)}

For ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces the orthogonal subspace has complementary
dimension to the original subspace. That is, where C is code space of length N

dim(C) + dim(C⊥) = N.

Example 16. Let C be any code of length n. The zero code word 0 = (0, . . . , 0)
is in the orthogonal dual code as for any c = (c1, . . . , cn) ∈ C we get

n(cid:88)

c · 0 =

ci · 0 = 0

i=1

Lemma 17. If C is the code for the projective plane of order 10 and x ∈ C
then x ∈ C⊥ if and only if x is the sum of an even number of lines.
Proof. Let x ∈ C be the sum of an even number of lines and let y be any code
word from C which we can write as the sum of lines, y = l1 + ··· + lk. Any li
from y intersects x in an even number of points by Lemma 13 which means that
there are an even number of places in the code where both li and x have one as
an entry. Then li · x is the sum of an even number of ones so li · x = 0. By the
distributive property of inner product we have

x · y = x · (l1 + ··· + lk) = x · l1 + ··· + x · lk = 0 + ··· + 0 = 0

so x ∈ C⊥. If x is the sum of an odd number of lines then take any line, l ∈ C
and the number of intersection points of l and x is odd. This means that the
number of columns where l and x both have the entry one is odd and l · x = 1.
Therefore x /∈ C⊥.

11

Lemma 18. If C is the binary code for a ﬁnite projective plane then

dim(C ∩ C⊥) = dim(C) − 1.

Proof. Lemma 17 tells us that where x ∈ C is the sum of an odd number of
lines x /∈ C⊥. This tells us

dim(C ∩ C⊥) ≤ dim(C⊥) < dim(C).

Let us now assume that dim(C) = k so we can choose a set of k vectors of
the code that form a basis for C. The lines of the plane are the generators for
the code so they must be able to provide such a basis which we will write as
{l1, l2, . . . , lk}. Next consider the vectors generated by {l2+l1, l3+l1, . . . , lk +l1},
a linearly independent set of k − 1 code words. These code words are a basis
for a vector subspace L ⊂ C as the dimension of L is less than that of C.
Additionally, since the generators for L are all the sum of an even number of
lines, every code word of L is the sum of an even number of vectors. As a result,
L ⊆ C⊥ by Lemma 17 so L ⊆ C ∩ C⊥ resulting in

k − 1 = dim(L) ≤ dim(C ∩ C⊥) < dim(C) = k.

As the dimension can only take integer values we know

dim(C ∩ C⊥) = k − 1 = dim(C) − 1.

Lemma 19. For n divisible by 2 exactly once, the code space C of a projective
plane of order n has the properties:

1. C⊥ ⊂ C

2. dim(C) =

n2 + n + 2

2

and

dim(C⊥) =

n2 + n

2

.

Proof. For an incidence matrix of the projective plane A recall that A has
dimensions (n2 + n + 1)× (n2 + n + 1). To simplify notation let N = n2 + n + 1.
Now we perform determinant preserving operations on A since we previously
calculated the determinant:

det(A) = ±(n + 1)n(n2+n)/2.

First, we add each of the ﬁrst N − 1 columns to the last column resulting in

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Then we subtract the bottom row from each of the others giving

det(A) =

The last equality derives from using cofactor expansion on the last column of the
matrix. The determinant of A is non-zero so we can infer that the determinant
of B2 is also non-zero and therefore B2 can be diagonalised by row operations
which do not change the absolute value of the determinant.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = ±|A2|

As this matrix is lower triangular we can ﬁnd the determinant by taking the
product of the diagonal elements.

det(A) = ±h1h2 ··· hN−1(n + 1) = ±(n + 1)n(n2+n)/2

h1h2 ··· hn2+n = ±n(n2+n)/2

As we have n divisible by 2 only once then (n2 +n)/2 is the maximum number of
hi that are divisible by 2. Now we consider a representation of A2 over a binary
ﬁeld by taking each entry modulo 2. The hi which were divisible by 2 are now
zero in the matrix and so the corresponding rows are zero rows and dependent.
Each of the other rows (of which there are at least N−(n2+n)/2 = (n2+n+2)/2)
contains a one on the diagonal (noting that n + 1 = 1 (mod 2) as n is divisible
by 2) and therefore they are linearly independent. Then

dim(C) ≥ (n2 + n + 2)/2

and by Lemma 18

dim(C⊥) ≥ dim(C ∩ C⊥) = dim(C) − 1 ≥ (n2 + n)/2.

As dim(C) and dim(C⊥) must sum to the length of the code N = n2 + n + 1 the
preceding equations must be equalities. The ﬁrst property follows from dim(C∩
C⊥) = dim(C) − 1 = dim(C⊥) given by Lemma 18. Since the intersection is a
subset of C⊥ with the dimension of C⊥ the intersection is the entirety of C⊥.
Therefore C⊥ ⊂ C.

3.2 Weight-enumerator equating

Finding the weight-enumerator polynomial for the projective plane of order
10 will tell us about its structure.
It reﬂects the number of code words of
each weight in the code which should be a natural number, so a negative or
non-integer coeﬃcient for any term of the polynomial would indicate the plane
could not exist. A theorem given here without proof will be immensely useful.

Theorem 20. (MacWilliams) For a binary code C and its orthogonal dual code
C⊥ the weight enumerators have the property

WC⊥ (x, y) =

1

|C| WC(x + y, x − y).

13

Along with the MacWilliams identity we need to try and ﬁnd as many Ai
values that are easily determined. Firstly, we know from Lemma 14 that there
are no code words of weight 1 or 2 (mod 4). We also know that A0 = 1 because
the zero code word is the unique weight zero conﬁguration in the code.

Lemma 21. For the code of the projective plane of order 10, there are no
conﬁgurations containing k points for 1 ≤ k ≤ 10 so A1 = A2 = ··· = A10 = 0.
Proof. Let x ∈ C be a conﬁguration of odd weight less than 111. Then consider
a point p not on x. There are 11 lines passing through p which must all
intersect x in an odd number of points by Lemma 13. Therefore each line must
intersect x at least once and the points must all be distinct as the lines have
their only intersection at p. Therefore w(x) ≥ 11.

If instead x ∈ C is a conﬁguration of even weight greater than 0, consider a
point p on x. There are 11 lines on p and each must intersect x in an even
number of points (Lemma 13) and therefore at least twice. Each line intersects
x at a point other than p and these 11 points are all distinct since the lines
intersect at p. Therefore w(x) ≥ 12.
Lemma 22. The projective plane of order 10 has 111 conﬁgurations of weight
11 so A11 = 111.

Proof. There are 111 lines of the projective plane which each contain 11 points.
If we show that every code word with weight 11 is a line of the plane then we
know they are equivalent and A11 = 111. Consider x ∈ C where w(x) = 11.
Then x is the sum of an odd number of lines (Lemma 14) so every line of the
plane intersects it an odd number of times (Lemma 13). Choose points a, b on
x which must lie on a unique line. Now we have two possibilities; There is some
point p on the line and not on x or all the points of x lie on this line. In the ﬁrst
case consider the 10 other lines passing through p which must each intersect
x at least once. All of the points of intersection must be distinct as the lines
already have an intersection at p. This implies there are 10 more points on x
other than a and b which is impossible. Therefore the second case must occur
and the line ab contains all points of x so x is a line.
This gives us A0 = 1, A1 = A2 = ··· = A10 = 0 and A11 = 111. Finally, note
that the values come in pairs where Ai = A111−i as the sum of all the lines
contains every point. This means that for all sum of k lines containing m points
the other 111− k lines sum to the other 111− m points and so every code word
has a matching conﬁguration of opposite weight.

From Lemma 19 we know that the dimension of C is 56. Being a binary code
we can deduce |C| = 256. Now we can use the MacWilliams identity to equate:

A4i(x + y)111−4i(x − y)4i +

A4i+3(x + y)108−4i(x − y)4i+3

i=0

(cid:35)

Equating the coeﬃcients for the polynomials gives a system of linear equations in
terms of A4i as A4i+3 = A111−(4i+3) = A4(27−i). Reducing in Mathematica tells
us that the system is underdetermined and there are three degrees of freedom.
The workbook used in equating the polynomials can be found at goo.gl/Gl0gCi.
As shown by the output three more Ai values need to be calculated to ﬁnd the
weight enumerator. Computer searches provided answers, ﬁnding A12 = A15 =
A19 = 0 [11, 12, 10]. The method used for the searches will be explained in
more depth in Section 4.

Now all the Ai are determined and are given here:

3.3 Code word of weight 19

Now that the weight enumerator has been determined it can be seen that A19 =
24, 675 is the smallest conﬁguration which is the sum of more than one line that
is present in the code. The fact that a weight 19 conﬁguration exists in the code
provides information about the possible structure of the incidence matrix so it
can be used as a basis for generating the matrix.
Let x ∈ C be a code word of weight 19. As x contains an odd number of points
it is the sum of an odd number of lines and therefore any line, l, intersects x
in an odd number of points. More speciﬁcally, l must intersect x in 1, 3 or
5 points. This is because if there are 11, 9 or 7 points of intersection for x
and l then w(x + l) = 8, 12 or 16 respectively. We already know there are no
conﬁgurations of these weights from the weight enumerator so there must be 1,
3 or 5 intersections from lines of the plane and we will call them “single lines”,
“triple lines” and “heavy lines” correspondingly.

15

Now we make a system of equations to ﬁnd the number of lines of the plane
intersecting x in 1, 3 or 5 points which we will represent by l1, l3 and l5. There
are 111 lines of the plane in total and they are partitioned by how many times
they intersect x giving

l1 + l3 + l5 = 111.

Another equation is formed by considering how many lines need to lie on the
points of x. Each of the 19 points in x is on 11 lines so collectively the lines
need to intersect x 19× 11 = 209 times. Since each l1 intersects x once; l3, three
times and the l5 intersect x ﬁve times we have

Lastly, we expect any two points of x to lie on exactly one line. The number of

distinct pairs of points in x is(cid:0)19
x but each triple line contains three points of x so provides a line for (cid:0)3
(cid:0)5
(cid:1) = 10 pairs in x. Therefore our third equation is

(cid:1) = 171. No single line contains two points of
(cid:1) = 3

distinct pairs. Similarly each heavy line contains ﬁve points of x so contains

l1 + 3l3 + 5l5 = 209.

2

2

2

Solving the system gives us these solutions:

3l3 + 10l5 = 171.

l1 = 68 l3 = 37 l5 = 6

Next we can consider how the incidence matrix might look. We can write it as

(cid:35)

(cid:34)

19

92
6 A1 A2
37 B1 B2
68 C1 C2

where the ﬁrst 19 columns (A1, B1, C1) of the matrix represent the points in x.
In the matrix A1 and A2 are the 6 heavy lines; B1 and B2 are the 37 triple lines
and C1 and C2 are the 68 single lines.

Now we want to know more about the structure of the lines passing through x.
Consider a point p ∈ x and let p1, p3 and p5 be the number of single, triple and
heavy lines containing p. Then as p is on 11 lines we conclude

p1 + p3 + p5 = 11.

The other 18 points of x must each lie on precisely one line through p. Each
triple line passes through two other points of x and each heavy line passes
through four other points of x so we get the equation

2p3 + 4p5 = 18.

16

Choosing integer values for p5 allows us to generate the following table of pos-
sibilities.

Now we can consider options for A1. This is the incidence matrix where the
heavy lines intersect x. There are 66 non-isomorphic matrices meaning the
starting points diﬀer in structure so they cannot be made to look the same by
simply changing the order of rows or columns. Two examples of non-isomorphic
conﬁgurations for A1 are:

Both conﬁgurations look like they have potential to be part of our incidence
matrix. However, it can be shown that neither of these are viable as A1.

In X we can see there are four ones in the ﬁrst column so this point of x has
four heavy lines on it. From the table we expect it to also have one triple line on
it. This triple line must have points 1, 18 and 19 on it since every point other
than 18 and 19 is already on a line through 1. The 6th row already has 18 and
19 on it which is a contradiction since there should only be one line containing
both. Therefore X cannot be A1 for the incidence matrix of a projective plane
of order 10.

Starting with Y also leads to contradictions. Notice that the last three rows
of Y have no intersection within x. They must intersect somewhere outside x,
but not in a single point p or this point lies on three heavy lines and has eight
other lines which intersect x at least once. This would mean the lines through
p would intersect x in at least 23 distinct points, clearly impossible for a code
word of weight 19. Consider the code word generated by adding x and the last
three lines. Since none of the lines intersect in x, a point in x is either on one
line or none of them. The points of x that are in the resulting code word are 1,

17

5, 9 and 13. Points outside x that are in the code word are points on one of the
heavy lines and not at the intersection of two of them. Each of the three heavy
lines contains six points outside of x, 4 distinct points and two points providing
intersections with the other two heavy lines. Therefore the code word has 1,
5, 9, and 13 from x and four points from outside of x for each heavy line for a
total of 16 points. As this was already excluded as a possibility by the weight
enumerator Y is not a possible start for the incidence matrix.

Of the 66 possibilities for A1 similar arguments rule out 21 of the A1 conﬁgura-
tions. This leaves 45 starting submatrices of size 6 × 19 that have the potential
to be extended. The process undertaken by computer search was ﬁrst to extend
the 6× 19 submatrix to one of size 43× 19 by ﬁnding all possible ways the triple
lines could lie on the 19 points of x. Each of these has a unique extension (up to
isomorphism) to a 111 × 19 conﬁguration by adding the incidence of the single
lines on x.

Next the incidence of points not in x needed to be found. Each heavy line
contains six points outside of x so the six columns corresponding to one of the
heavy lines is completed ﬁrst. After this the external points of another heavy
line are chosen to continue the matrix. This next addition might only consist
of ﬁve new columns if the heavy lines intersect outside x and this makes the
search more eﬃcient where possible. When the computer search was carried out,
although every conﬁguration could be extended to some incidence submatrix on
the points of 4 heavy lines, none of the 45 starting arrangements could generate
incidence on a 5th heavy line that was consistent with the rest of the matrix.
Therefore it was concluded that no incidence matrix exists for the projective
plane of order 10 and that the plane too cannot exist.

18

4 A Search for Code Words of Weight 15

In this section we will explore how MacWilliams, Thompson and Sloane [12]
demonstrated that there are no code words, x, of weight 15 generated by the
incidence matrix of the projective plane of order 10. We will follow the reasoning
of their article and carry out a search for code words of weight 15 in order to
conﬁrm their result. The method used is similar to that shown in the previous
section where the existence of such a conﬁguration x generates a submatrix
which cannot be extended to an entire incidence matrix.

The Lemmas from section 3 provide almost enough background for us to start
looking at properties of a projective plane where there is a 15 point conﬁgura-
tion. Beforehand however, we need to talk about properties of hyperovals of the
plane.

4.1 Hyperovals of the Plane

Deﬁnition 23. A hyperoval of a projective plane of order n where n is even is
a set of n + 2 points, no three of which are collinear.

Lemma 24. Code words of weight 12 in the code are precisely the hyperovals
of the plane.

Proof. Let x be a code word of weight 12. Every line of the plane intersects x in
an even number of points by Lemma 13. Consider any point p on x. Then p has
11 lines passing through it and each line must intersect x in at least one other
point to have an even number of intersections. Each of these additional points
must be distinct since the lines intersect at p so the 11 points and p account
for all 12 points and no line can intersect more than twice. Therefore x is a
hyperoval.

Now take a hyperoval, σ. Let L be the set of (cid:0)12

with σ. Consider the submatrix of the incidence matrix corresponding to the
lines of L.

The ﬁrst 12 columns each contain 11 ones since the 11 lines lying on each point
of σ must be part of the line set L. Each of the 66 rows also contains 11 ones
as they are entire lines of the projective plane containing 11 points. This leaves
66 · 11 − 12 · 11 = 54 · 11 = 6 · 99 ones in columns 13 onward. No point p /∈ σ

19

lies on more than 6 lines as that implies there are 7 lines passing through p that
intersect σ. Each line must intersect σ twice and the points of intersection must
be distinct as the lines all pass through p and this is not possible as σ does not
contain 14 points. As there are 99 points not in σ and 6· 99 points to distribute
among them with no more than 6 in each then there must be precisely 6 ones
in each of the columns 13-111. Now if we take the linear combination that is
the sum of all 66 of these lines in binary then p ∈ σ lies on an odd number (11)
and p /∈ σ lies on an even number of lines (6). The resulting conﬁguration is a
vector of weight 12 in the code space.

4.2 Assuming a Weight 15 Code Word Exists

We will assume there is some code word of weight 15 and see what is implied.
Let A = {1, 2, . . . , 15} be the set of points contained in such a code word.

Lemma 25. Every line of the projective plane intersects A in 1, 3 or 5 points.

Proof. Let l be any line of the projective plane. It must intersect A in an odd
number of points by Lemma 13. Then by Lemma 10 we get

w(A + l) = w(A) + w(l) − 2w(A ∩ l)

= 15 + 11 − 2w(A ∩ l)

Lemma 21 tells us that weight of A + l cannot be 8 or 4 so w(A ∩ l) cannot be
9 or 11. Lastly, the number of intersections of A and l cannot be 7 or A + l
contains 12 points and is therefore a hyperoval, yet l intersects A + l in the
4 points of l not in A. This contradicts our earlier deﬁnition of hyperovals.
Therefore A and l intersect in 1, 3 or 5 points.

Lemma 26. Of the 111 lines in the projective plane, 90 intersect A once, 15
intersect A three times and the remaining 6 intersect ﬁve times.

Proof. We will use the same notation and technique as we used when looking at
the weight 19 code word in the last section. This means we will give the names
single lines, triple lines and heavy lines to lines with 1,3 or 5 intersections with
A and let the number of each be l1, l3 and l5 respectively.

Every line of the projective plane intersects A in one of 1,3 or 5 points so one
equation is

We can also consider the fact that every pair of points in A (of which there

(cid:1) = 105) must have a line passing through both. Each triple line passes
(cid:1) = 3 pairs of points of A and each heavy line passes through(cid:0)5

A third equation is generated by noting that each point of A has 11 lines passing
through it so the total number of intersection of lines with points in A is 11· 15.
We also know how many times each single, triple and heavy line intersects points
of A so

l1 + 3l3 + 5l5 = 11 · 15.

20

Solving the 3 equations gives us the result

l1 = 90

l3 = 15

l5 = 6.

Using notation consistent with [12] we label the heavy lines B1, . . . , B6.

Lemma 27. The intersection of two distinct Bis is a point in A.
Proof. If there is a point p /∈ A where two Bis intersect then p has 9 other lines
passing through it. Each of these 9 lines intersects A at least once by Lemma
13, but each of the intersections should be distinct from each other and also the
10 points of the Bis. This is not possible as A only has 15 points. Therefore
the Bis must intersect in an element of A.

Lemma 28. No point lies on more than two Bis
Proof. Let point p ∈ A lie on lines B1, B2 and B3. It is not possible for another
heavy line to contain p as there are only two remaining points of A. Let B4
contain one point of each of B1,B2 and B3 and both of the two remaining
points of A. Then B5 can only contain a maximum of one point from each of
the previous lines and then can only have four points of intersection with A
which is a contradiction.

intersect at a single point. There are (cid:0)6

(cid:1) = 15 pairs of Bis so the distinct

Now we know that each pair of Bis intersects in a point of A, but no three

intersection points mean that each point of A is the intersection of two heavy
lines. Without loss of generality we can now write a matrix representing the
points of A on each B1, . . . , B6.

As the intersections of these lines is in A all the remaining points on Bi must
be distinct. We let B={76,. . . ,111} be the 36 other points on the Bis. Now we
want to move on to looking at how the triple lines intersect A. Let C1, . . . , C15
be the lines that intersect A in 3 points.

Lemma 29. Each point of A lies on exactly three Cis
Proof. Each p ∈ A is on two heavy lines containing four other points of A. This
only leaves six other points of A for Cis on p to pass through so there must be
a maximum of 3. In total the 15 Cis intersect A 45 times (3 each) so this is an
average of 3 Cis through each point of A. Therefore, as no point lies on more
than 3, each point of A is incident with precisely 3 Cis.

21

Now we can form a matrix representing the incidence of the Cis on A based on
the Bi matrix we already have. Up to permutation we must have the following
arrangement.

Every Ci intersects with each Bi in a point in A. Therefore there are 60 points
remaining with which to ﬁnish the entries of the Ci rows. These points will be
represented by the set C = {16, . . . , 75}.

Lemma 30. Each point in C is the intersection of exactly two Ci
Proof. If a point p ∈ C is on three Cis then these Cis already intersect 9 points of
A. The remaining 8 lines containing p should each have at least one intersection
with A, but there are only 6 points of A left which is a contradiction. Therefore
each point of C can be contained in two Cis at most. Each Ci contains 8 points
from C. As there are 15 of these lines there are 120 points needed to ﬁll in the
incidence table. There are only 60 points in C, none of which can be in more
than 2 rows so each must be used exactly twice to create the Ci lines.

Now we can complete the Bi and Ci rows.

Lemma 31. The 90 single lines of the projective plane each contain four points
of B and six points of C.

Proof. Let l be a single line. Then l intersects A at one point, which will be the
intersection of two Bis. As l contains no other points of A it must contain four
points of B in order to intersect with the other four Bis which have distinct
points of B. The total number of points on l is 11 so the remaining six points
are in C.

4.3 Group Operations on A

Next we want to examine the structure of our current arrangement to reduce the
computation we need to carry out. Let points of A correspond to transpositions
of the symbols t1, . . . , t6 decided by the Bi lines each point of A lies on:

Then the operations τi representing conjugation by (ti, ti+1) for i=1,. . . ,5 act
on A and generate a group of operations, G. Furthermore, the set A is invariant
under G as shown by the following table of τis operating on A.

The set of transpositions representing the ﬁve points of A on B1 is

{(t1t2), (t1t3), (t1t4), (t1t5), (t1t6)}

and we use it to represent the line B1. The other Bis are also represented as
the set of 5 points from A they contain and together the set of 6 Bis is invariant
under the operations of G. The Ci lines are also related by conjugation, but are
identiﬁed with a set of three transpositions. The line C1 can be viewed as

{(t1t2), (t3t4), (t5t6)}.

Similarly the set of Cis is invariant under the operations of G and this gives us
a way of extending G to operate on the points of C. Since every point of C is
the intersection of two Cis we consider how G acts on those two lines and ﬁnd
the new intersection point so as to maintain incidence under G.
Example 32. Consider the point 16 ∈ C. This point lies on C1 and C5 which
are represented by {(t1t2), (t3t4), (t5t6)} and {(t1t3), (t2t5), (t4t6)}. If we apply
τ4 as an operation on 16 we need to look at how τ4 aﬀects C1 and C5.
τ4(C1) = {(t4t5)(t1t2)(t4t5), (t4t5)(t3t4)(t4t5), (t4t5)(t5t6)(t4t5)}

= {(t1t2), (t3t5), (t4t6)}
= {1, 11, 14}
= C2

τ4(C5) = {(t4t5)(t1t3)(t4t5), (t4t5)(t2t5)(t4t5), (t4t5)(t4t6)(t4t5)}

= {(t1t3), (t2t4), (t5t6)}
= {2, 7, 15}
= C4

Now we ﬁnd the point of intersection of C2 and C4 which is 24, therefore
τ4(16) = 24. The table below shows the behaviour of each element of C un-
der each τi.

We can reduce computation in a later section by noting that the only τi which
does not ﬁx the point 1 is τ2. Therefore, let G1 be the subgroup generated by
τ1, τ3, τ4 and τ5 under which 1 is unchanged.

4.4 The 90 Single Lines

Here we employ the help of a computer in trying to complete the 90 rows
corresponding to the single lines of the projective plane. We start by considering
the remaining lines passing through the point 1. There are already 2 heavy
lines and 3 triples lines that contain 1 so we need to ﬁnd the 6 single lines that
complete the set of lines incident with 1. Each of these lines contains 6 points
of C by Lemma 31. The 6 points must be points that are not already on a
line containing 1 so they must be selected from the numbers that have not been
crossed out in the following table. Additionally these 6 points must provide
exactly one intersection with each Ci not passing through 1. This means each
row other than the ﬁrst three must have exactly one of the 6 points on it. One
collection of 6 numbers that could lie on a single line has been given in the last
column with each number shown beside both rows in which it occurs.

Each set of 6 points fulﬁlling the above conditions is called a 6-set. There are
344 6-sets for the point 1 and we will let L1 represent the set of all 344 of
them. We then generalise this to let Li denote the set of 6-sets which are being
considered as points of the single lines through point i ∈ A. It is possible to
generate all the Lis from L1 by using elements of G. An element of G that
maps 1 to i ∈ A maps a 6-set of L1s to a 6-set of Li.

Example 33. We can map our sample 6-set for the point 1 to a 6-set for
another point by using an element of G. We already have a table for how the
generators, τi act on points of C so using a transformation of τ2 will be the
easiest to demonstrate. As τ2(1) = 2 we will get a 6-set for L2.
τ2{41, 46, 53, 71, 72, 75} = {18, 26, 35, 70, 74, 73}

We want to choose 6 6-sets from L1 to be elements of C on the lines through
1. As the lines intersect at 1 we need to ﬁnd all 6 elements subsets L1 where
the 6-sets are distinct. Each of these subsets is called a K6 which arises from
viewing the elements of L1 as vertices of a graph. Two elements are connected
by an edge if the 6-sets corresponding to the vertices do not have any points in
common. This means that a set of 6 6-sets looks like a fully connected graph
on 6 vertices, a K6, if the 6-sets are all mutually distinct.

We calculated that there are 42,496 possible K6s for the point 1. In order to
reduce the number we need to further investigate we consider the permutation
G1 and how it acts on these K6s. If a projective plane does exist then it must
have these K6s through each point of A that make up the 90 single lines of the
plane. Applying a permutation from G1 will map K6s to K6s, however they may
now be K6s for a diﬀerent point of A depending on the action of that element of
G1 on the points from A seen on page 27. We picked G1 to preserve the number
1 so we know that the K6 on 1 will remain on the point 1. We may consider
these 42,496 K6s through 1 as being separated into 1021 diﬀerent orbits under
G1 and by selecting any one K6 from each orbit we only need to investigate 1021
cases. If any of the K6s through 1 from a particular orbit can be completed into

26

a plane then it means there is a consistent set of 15 K6s through each point of A
including this K6. This can be transformed to the representative case from that
orbit by an operation of G1 which will preserve the K6s such that there is still a
K6 going through each point of A. Thus it does not matter which selection we
make from the orbit, if we can show that any point of A does not have a viable
K6 passing through it then no starting K6 from the orbit is part of a projective
plane of order 10.

Each of the 1021 K6s for the lines passing through 1 is considered individually
now, so let U be the K6 selected. We have chosen the 6 points from C on each
line, but the six lines passing though 1 each still need to contain 4 points from
B. As B1 and B2 contain the point 1 there are only 24 points of B remaining
to be part of the the 6 single lines through 1 and each one of these 24 points
must be contained in exactly one line. Each single line must contain one point
from each of B3-B6 so as not to intersect more than once with any of the Bi
lines and the points from these lines are currently all equivalent so without loss
of generality we may assume the arrangement below.

Next for any potential set of single lines passing through 1 we can look at the
set of 6-sets for another point in A in order to try and ﬁnd the 6 single lines
passing through that point. To reduce calculation times as much as possible
we choose the next point to be 10 as points 2 to 9 are contained in a heavy line
with 1 and thus have less overlap in the matching vector discussed later. For
U , a K6 chosen through 1, the viable 6-sets through 10 is reduced from the
344 candidates of L10 as no pair of points contained in one of the six lines of
U are not permitted to be contained in another single line through 10 so some
previously viable 6-sets must be discarded.

Though we don’t know much about the points from B and their arrangement
on U we can discern information from which points of B are in U . As 10 is
contained in the heavy lines B3 and B4 each of the 6 single lines through 10
must contain one point of B from each of B1,B2,B5 and B6. For any one of the
6 lines through 10 the two points of intersection with B5 and B6 will each be
a point of intersection with a distinct line of U as all the points of B on those
lines were used in the array above. They must be distinct lines or a line passing
through 10 and a line passing through 1 would have two intersection points.
As each of the 6 lines through 10 intersects 2 lines of U in a point of B they
must intersect the remaining 4 lines of U in C. Therefore in order to still be a
potential single line a 6-set from L10 should intersect four 6-sets of U in C.

Example 34. Here is one possible arrangement of the points in B for the 6
lines through 10. It can be observed that each line intersects two of the lines

through 1 shown above.

In order to ensure the K6 from L10 intersects U correctly we introduce the
concept of a matching vector. We let mi be the number of intersections a 6-set
from L10 has with the i-th row of U , then the matching vector is given by

m = m1, m2, . . . , m6.

For each U the 6-sets that do not have a matching vector containing 4 ones
and 2 zeros are discarded from L10. All possible K6s that can be generated
from the remaining 6-sets of L10 are found and we call each possible K6 V and
record it as a pair with U . At this point the number of {U, V } pairs varies
depending on the set of representations chosen as options for U , but we had
16,205 in our calculation.

Now that we have the lines through 1 and 10 we want to ﬁnd the 6 lines that
intersect A at point 15 for maximum overlap with the two sets of lines we already
have. Any single line through 15 intersects with two lines through 1 and two
lines through 10 in points of B. This means for each choice of U and V we can
use two matching vectors; one checking the intersection of 6-sets with U and
one checking intersections with V . If either matching vector does not contain
4 ones and 2 zeros then the 6-set is removed from L15. As before all sets of
6 disjoint 6-sets are found from the reﬁned L15 and one is chosen as W . At
this point we had 226 possibilities for {U, V, W} and 96 diﬀerent U s could be
extended to ﬁnd a W .

For each selection of U , V and W a K6, X, from L11 needs to be found. Here
we have to modify our matching vector a little. Since the point 11 is on C2
with 1 it still needs to have 4 ones and 2 zeros with respect to the intersections
with U , but the 6-sets should intersect each 6-set of V and W 3 times. The
lines through 11 intersect three of the lines in V in the points contained in B1,
B2 and B6 and intersect three of the lines in W in points contained in B1, B2
and B4 leaving 3 intersections in C for lines passing through 11 and V and also
their intersection with W . After eliminating unsuitable L11 elements we create
the possibilities for K6 as usual and ﬁnd 17 diﬀerent collections of U , V , W
and X. None of the 17 can be extended to include Y , a K6 from L14 using the
same method. Therefore it is not possible to construct the 90 single lines of the
projective plane so our assumption that there is a vector of weight 15 in the
projective plane of order 10 must be incorrect.

4.5 Computer Veriﬁcation

The results presented so far are those found by our computer search. The
results given by MacWilliams, Sloane and Thompson in [12] are slightly

28

diﬀerent beyond the 1021 representative K6s as expected. This is because
the existence of an entire plane containing any of the K6s from an orbit is
equivalent to the entire orbit being viable, but since we are looking at K6s
through point 10 ﬁrst for our representation it might be a diﬀerent set of K6s
under G1. This makes conﬁrming their search more diﬃcult, but our search
also came to the conclusion that no K6, Y , could be found to extend the set
of U , V , W and X. We found 17 {U, V, W, X}s which is comparable with the
result of 25 found by MacWilliams, Sloane and Thompson. The workbook for
the search can be found at https://goo.gl/DUrCFJ
