C 1,α ESTIMATES FOR THE FULLY NONLINEAR

SIGNORINI PROBLEM

XAVIER FERN ´ANDEZ-REAL

Abstract. We study the regularity of solutions to the fully nonlinear thin ob-
stacle problem. We establish local C 1,α estimates on each side of the smooth
obstacle, for some small α > 0.

Our results extend those of Milakis-Silvestre [MS08] in two ways: ﬁrst, we do
not assume solutions nor operators to be symmetric, and second, our estimates
are local, in the sense that do not rely on the boundary data.

As a consequence, we prove C 1,α regularity even when the problem is posed in

general Lipschitz domains.

1. Introduction

The aim of this work is to study the regularity of the solutions to the Signorini

or thin obstacle problem for fully nonlinear operators.

Given a domain D ⊂ Rn, the thin obstacle problem involves a function u : D → R,
an obstacle ϕ : S → R deﬁned on a (n − 1)-dimensional manifold S, a Dirichlet
boundary condition given by g : ∂D → R, and a second order elliptic operator L,

Intuitively, one can think of it as ﬁnding the shape of a membrane with pre-
scribed boundary conditions considering that there is a very thin obstacle forcing
the membrane to be above it.

When L is the Laplacian, the C 1,α regularity of solutions was ﬁrst proved in 1979
by Caﬀarelli in [Caf79]. Later, the optimal value of α was found by Athanasopoulos
and Caﬀarelli in [AC04], where solutions were proved to be in C 1, 1
2 on either side
of the obstacle. More recently, this has been extended to linear operators with x

dependence L =P aij(x)∂iju in [Gui09, GS14, KRS15].

Here, we study a nonlinear version of problem (1.1). More precisely, we study
(1.1) with Lu = F (D2u), a convex fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic operator. Since

all of our estimates are of local character, we consider the problem in B1,

(1.2)

u ≥ ϕ on B1 ∩ {xn = 0}.

Here, ϕ : B1 ∩ {xn = 0} → R is the obstacle, and we assume that it is C 1,1. We
study the regularity of solutions on either side of the obstacle.

We assume that




F is convex, uniformly elliptic
with ellipticity constants 0 < λ ≤ Λ, and with F (0) = 0.

When u is symmetric, this problem was studied by Milakis and Silvestre in [MS08],

and is equivalent to

on B1 ∩ {xn = 0}.

Moreover, they also implicitly assume a symmetry condition on the operator F , in
particular, that F (A) = F ( ˜A), where ˜Ain = ˜Ani = −Ain = −Ani for i < n and
˜Aij = Aij otherwise. Under this assumption, they proved interior C 1,α regularity up
to the obstacle on either side by also assuming that u ≥ ϕ + ε on ∂B1 ∩ {xn = 0},
for some ε > 0. Equivalently, they assume that the coincidence set is contained in
some ball B1−δ for some δ > 0. This assumption is important in [MS08] to prove
semiconvexity of solutions.

Our main result, Theorem 1.1 below, extends the result of [MS08] in two ways.
First, we do not assume anything on the boundary data, so that we give a local
estimate. Second, we consider also non-symmetric solutions u to (1.2) with operators
not necessarily satisfying any symmetry assumption, and prove C 1,α regularity for
such solutions.

In the linear case, one can symmetrise solutions to (1.2), and then the study of
such solutions reduces to problem (1.4). However, in the present nonlinear setting
an estimate for (1.4) does not imply one for (1.2).

Our main result is the following, stating that any solution to (1.2) is C 1,α on either

side of the obstacle, for some small α > 0.

Theorem 1.1. Let F be a nonlinear operator satisfying (1.3) and let u be any
viscosity solution to (1.2) with ϕ ∈ C 1,1. Then, u ∈ C 1,α(B+

1/2) and,

for some constants α > 0 and C depending only on n, λ, and Λ.

Our proof of the semiconvexity of solutions is completely diﬀerent from the one
done in [MS08] and follows by means of a Bernstein’s technique. On the other hand,
to prove the C 1,α regularity in the non symmetric case we follow [Caf79, MS08], but
new ideas are needed. We deﬁne a symmetrised solution to the problem and follow

the steps in [Caf79] and [MS08] using appropriate inequalities satisﬁed by the sym-
metrised solution. This yields the regularity of the symmetrised normal derivative
at free boundary points. Then, we show that this implies the C 1,α regularity of the
original function u at free boundary points, by using the ideas from [Caf89]. Fi-
nally, we show that the regularity of u at free boundary points yields the regularity
of the symmetrized normal derivative at all points on xn = 0, and that this yields
the regularity of u on either side of the obstacle.

As an immediate corollary it follows an estimate when the thin obstacle problem

is posed in a bounded Lipschitz domain D ⊂ Rn.
Corollary 1.2. Let D ⊂ Rn be a bounded Lipschitz domain, and let K ⋐ D. Let
F be a nonlinear operator satisfying (1.3). Let ϕ : D ∩ {xn = 0} → R be a C 1,1
function, and let u be the solution to

n, λ, Λ, D, and K.

2. Lipschitz estimate and semiconvexity

2.1. Lipschitz estimate. We begin with a proposition showing that any solution
to (1.2) is Lipschitz, as long as the obstacle is C 1,1.

Proposition 2.1. Let u be any solution to (1.2) with F satisfying (1.3) and ϕ ∈
C 1,1. Then u is Lipschitz in B1/2 with,

for some C depending only on n and the ellipticity constants λ and Λ.

Proof. We will extend the obstacle ϕ to a function h deﬁned in the whole B1, and we
treat u as a solution to a classical “thick” obstacle problem. We deﬁne h separately
in B+

Notice that h is Lipschitz in B7/8; see [MS06, Proposition 2.2]. By denoting

we have

1 ),
K0 := kukL∞(B1) + kϕkC 1,1(B∗

khkLip(B7/8) ≤ CK0,

and by the maximum principle u ≥ h. Moreover, u is a solution to a classical
obstacle problem in B1 with h as the obstacle. We show next that this implies u is
Lipschitz, with a quantitative estimate.

To begin with, since h is Lipschitz, ﬁxed any x0 ∈ B1/2 and 0 < r < 1/4, there

exists some C0 depending only on n, λ, and Λ such that
sup
Br(x0)|h(x) − h(x0)| ≤ C0K0r.

(2.4)

Notice that, by the strong maximum principle, the coincidence set {u = h} is ∆,
the coincidence set of the thin obstacle problem. Suppose then that x0 ∈ ∆, i.e.,
u(x0) = h(x0). Since u ≥ h, in particular we have that

inf
Br(x0)

(u(x) − u(x0)) ≥ −C0K0r.

(2.5)

because h is Lipschitz. Now let

q(x) = u(x) − u(x0) + C0K0r.

C 1,α ESTIMATES FOR THE FULLY NONLINEAR SIGNORINI PROBLEM

5

We already know q ≥ 0 in Br(x0). On the other hand, from (2.4),

q(x) ≤ 2C0K0r

on Br(x0) ∩ ∆.

Moreover, q is a supersolution,

F (D2q) = F (D2u) ≤ 0

in Br(x0).

Let ¯q be the viscosity solution to F (D2¯q) = 0 in Br(x0) with ¯q = q on ∂Br(x0).
We have ¯q ≤ q in Br(x0) and by the non-negativity of ¯q on the boundary, ¯q ≥ 0 in
Br(x0).
Thus, q < ¯q + 2C0K0r on ∂Br(x0), and q ≤ ¯q + 2C0K0r in Br(x0)∩ ∆. Therefore,

q ≤ ¯q + 2C0K0r

in Br(x0).

On the other hand, we know 0 ≤ ¯q(x0) ≤ q(x0) = C0K0r, and by the Harnack
inequality, ¯q ≤ CC0K0r in Br/2(x0). Putting all together we obtain that u(x) −
u(x0) ≤ CC0K0r for some constant C > 0. Thus, combining this with (2.5),

sup

Br(x0)|u(x) − u(x0)| ≤ C(cid:0)kukL∞(B1) + kϕkC 1,1(B∗

1 )(cid:1) r,

for some constant C depending only on n, λ, and Λ.

(2.6)

We have obtained that the solution is Lipschitz on points of the coincidence set.

Let us use interior estimates to deduce Lipschitz regularity inside B1/2.

Take any points x, y ∈ B1/2, and let r = |x − y|. Deﬁne
ρ := min{dist(x, ∆), dist(y, ∆)},

and let x∗, y∗ ∈ ∆, x∗ = (x′, 0), y∗ = (y′, 0) for x′, y′ ∈ ∆∗, be such that dist(x, ∆) =
|x − x∗| and dist(y, ∆) = |y − y∗|. We now separate two cases:

• If ρ ≤ 4r, then

|u(x) − u(y)| ≤ |u(x) − u(x∗)| + |u(y) − u(y∗)| + |ϕ(x′) − ϕ(y′)|

≤ Cρ + C(r + ρ) + 2C(r + ρ) ≤ Cr

for some constant C. We are using here that ϕ is Lipschitz and that if |x − x∗| = ρ,
then |y − y∗| ≤ r + ρ and |x∗ − y∗| ≤ 2(r + ρ).
• If ρ > 4r, we can use interior estimates. Suppose x is such that dist(x, ∆) = ρ,
and notice Bρ/2(x) ⊂ B1 \ ∆, so that in Bρ/2(x), F (D2u) = 0. We can now use the
interior Lipschitz estimates (see, for example, [CC95, Chapter 5]),

[u]Lip(Bρ/4) ≤

oscBρ/2(x)u ≤ C

for some constant C. We are using here that the supremum and the inﬁmum of u
in Bρ/2(x) are controlled respectively by Cρ + ϕ(x∗) and −Cρ + ϕ(x∗).
(2.1).

Thus, we have proved that the solution is Lipschitz in B1/2, with the estimate

2.2. Preliminary consideration. Before continuing to prove the semiconvexity
and semiconcavity result, we introduce a change of variables that will be useful in
this section and the next one. Notice that, given a function w, we can express the
nonlinear operator F as

F (D2w(x)) = sup

γ∈Γ(cid:0)Lij

γ ∂xixj w(x) + cγ(cid:1) ,

for some family of symmetric uniformly elliptic operators with ellipticity constants
λ and Λ, Lij
γ ∂xixj , indexed by γ ∈ Γ. Since F (0) = 0, there is some symmetric
uniformly elliptic operator from this family given by a matrix ˆL such that

tr( ˆLD2w(x)) = ˆLij∂xixj w(x) ≤ F (D2w(x)).

We now change coordinates in such a way that the matrix of this operator in the
new coordinates, denoted ˆLA, fulﬁls ˆLin
A = 0 for i < n. More precisely, if we
denote ˆL′ the matrix in Symn−1 given by the n − 1 ﬁrst indices of ˆL, and we denote
n = ( ˆLin)1≤i≤n−1 the vector of Rn−1, we change variables as
ˆL′

A = ˆLni

where A is the matrix given by

x 7→ y = Ax,

A :=


Idn−1 −¯a

0 . . . 0

,




and ¯a = ( ˆL′)−1 · ˆL′

n is a vector in Rn−1. We deﬁne the new nonlinear operator ˜F as

˜F (N) = F (AT NA), for all N ∈ Symn,

so that it is consistent with the change of variables, in the sense that if ˜w(y) =
w(A−1y), then F (D2w(x)) = ˜F (D2 ˜w(y)).

We trivially have that ˜F is convex and ˜F (0) = 0. In the new coordinates we still
have that ˆLij
A∂yiyj is a symmetric uniformly elliptic operator, but now the ellipticity
constants λ and Λ have changed depending only on n, λ, and Λ. The same occurs
with all the operators in the family deﬁning F , so that after changing coordinates, F
is still a convex uniformly elliptic operator with ellipticity constants depending only
on n, λ, and Λ. Indeed, for any matrices N, NP ∈ Symn−1 with NP ≥ 0 we have
that (using the deﬁnition of uniform ellipticity in [CC95, Chapter 2] and noticing
that AT NP A ≥ 0),
kA−1k−2kNPk ≤ λkAT NP Ak ≤ ˜F (N + NP ) − ˜F (N) ≤ ΛkAT NP Ak ≤ ΛkAk2kNPk,
and it is easy to bound kA−1k and kAk from the deﬁnition of A, depending only on
n, λ and Λ.
After changing variables, the regularity of the solution remains the same up to

multiplicative constants in the bounds depending only on n, λ, and Λ.

C 1,α ESTIMATES FOR THE FULLY NONLINEAR SIGNORINI PROBLEM

7

As an abuse of notation we will call the new variables (x′, xn), the new operator F ,
and the new ellipticity constants λ and Λ, understanding that they might depend on
the original ellipticity constants and the dimension, n. This will not be a problem,
since in all the statements of the present work n, λ, and Λ appear together in the
dependence of the constants.

Thus, throughout the paper we will assume that there exists a ﬁxed symmetric

uniformly elliptic operator ˆL such that

ˆLij∂xixj w ≤ F (D2w), and ˆLin = ˆLni = 0 for i < n.

(2.7)

This change of variables is useful because, for any function w,
ˆLij∂xixj (w(x′,−xn)) = ˆLij(∂xixj w)(x′,−xn),

which will allow us to symmetrise the solution and still have a supersolution for the
Pucci extremal operator M−. We also use it to prove a semiconcavity result from
semiconvexity in the following proof of Proposition 2.2.

2.3. Semiconvexity and semiconcavity estimates. We next prove the semicon-
vexity of solutions in the directions parallel to the domain of the obstacle. To do it,
we use a Bernstein’s technique in the spirit of [AC04].

Proof. The second part, (b), follows from (a) using the deﬁnition of uniformly elliptic
operator and the fact that we changed variables (in the previous subsection) in order
to have matrix ˆL fulﬁlling (2.7). We denote by ˆL′ and D2

corresponding to the n − 1 ﬁrst indices of ˆL and D2u respectively. Now, from

occurs along the free boundary. By the deﬁnition of ¯hε and recalling that hε = ¯hε
in the coincidence set, this implies ∂τ τ uε ≥ −CK0 in {uε = hε} ∩ B7/8, for some

Let us assume now that the minimum x0 of fε in B7/8 is attained at some interior

point x0 outside the coincidence set {uε = hε}.
Let us also assume that the operator F not only is convex, but also F ∈ C ∞, so
that solutions are C 4 outside the coincidence set (see the end of the proof for the
general case F Lipschitz). In this case, the linearised operator of F at x0,

L0v = aijvij := Fij(D2uε(x0))vij,

is uniformly elliptic with ellipticity constants λ and Λ. Moreover, for any ρ ∈ Sn−1,
(2.13)

L0uε(x0) ≥ 0, L0∂ρuε(x0) = 0, L0∂ρρuε(x0) ≤ 0.
This is a standard result, which can be found in [CC95, Lemma 9.2].

For simplicity in the following computations we denote w = uε. If x0 is an interior

minimum of fε (which is a C 2 function) in B7/8, then

0 = ∇fε(x0) = (∇ηwτ τ + η∇wτ τ − 2µwi∇wi)(x0),

If F is not smooth, then it can be regularised convoluting with a molliﬁer in the
space of symmetric matrices, so that it can be approximated uniformly in compact
sets by a sequence {Fk}k∈N of convex smooth uniformly elliptic operators with el-
lipticity constants λ and Λ; also, by subtracting Fk(0), we can assume Fk(0) = 0.
Note that, in B7/8 and for every ε > 0 we have uniform C 1,γ estimates in k for the
solutions to (2.10) with operators Fk, since the obstacle h is in C 1,1 in a neighbour-
hood of the free boundary. By Arzel`a-Ascoli there exists a subsequence converging
uniformly, and therefore, the estimate (2.18) can be extended to solutions of (2.10)
with operators not necessarily smooth. Thus, (2.18) follows for any F not necessarily
C ∞.

Note that uε converges uniformly to u, since for all δ > 0, there exists some ε > 0

Since the right-hand side of (2.18) is independent of ε, and uε converges uniformly

small enough such that u + δ > uε ≥ u in B1.

α > 0. We will prove this in this section.

A main step towards Theorem 1.1 consists of proving that σ ∈ C α(B∗
We begin by noticing that σ(x′) = 0 for x′ ∈ Ω∗ (by the C 2,α interior estimates),
1 : u(x′, 0) > ϕ(x′)}. In general, however, we

where we recall that Ω∗ := {x′ ∈ B∗
have the following:
Lemma 3.1. The function σ deﬁned by (3.1) is non-positive, i.e., σ ≤ 0 in B∗
1.
Proof. Suppose it is not true, and there exists some ¯x′ ∈ B∗
1 such that σ(¯x′) > 0.
Let δ > 0 be such that B∗
1, so that by the semiconcavity in Proposition 2.2
applied to Bδ/2((¯x′, 0)), uxnxn(¯x′, 0) ≤ C for some constant C, that now depends
also on δ. However,

δ (¯x′) ⊂ B∗

which means

σ(¯x′) = lim

(uxn(¯x′, xn) − uxn(¯x′,−xn)) > 0,

uxn(¯x′, xn) − uxn(¯x′,−xn)

2xn

→ +∞, as xn ↓ 0+,

a contradiction with the bound in uxnxn.

(cid:3)

We will now adapt the ideas of [Caf79] to our non-symmetric setting. For this,

we use a symmetrised solution, deﬁned as follows
u(x′, xn) + u(x′,−xn)

v(x′, xn) :=

,

for (x′, xn) ∈ B1.

Here u is any solution to (1.2).

Notice that

vxn(x′, xn) ≤ 0

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

σ(x′) = 2vxn(x′, 0) = 0, for x′ ∈ Ω∗.

The following result follows from the results in the previous section. We will
use the notation M+ and M− to refer to the Pucci’s extremal operators with the
implicit ellipticity constants λ and Λ (see [CC95, Chapter 2] for the deﬁnition and
basic properties of such operators).

Lemma 3.2. Let u be a solution to the nonlinear thin obstacle problem (1.2), and
let v be deﬁned by (3.2). Then v is Lipschitz in B+

for some constant C depending only on n, λ, and Λ.

Proof. The Lipschitz regularity comes from the Lipschitz regularity in u, proved in
Proposition 2.1.

In (3.5) the ﬁrst inequality follows thanks to the change of variables introduced in
Subsection 2.2. Indeed, there exists some operator given by a matrix ˆL as in (2.7)
uniformly elliptic with ellipticity constants λ and Λ such that

ˆLij∂xixj (u(x′,−xn)) = ˆLij(∂xixj u)(x′,−xn) ≤ F ((D2u)(x′,−xn)) ≤ 0,

so that

as we wanted.

M−(D2v) ≤ ˆLij∂xixj v ≤ 0,

The second expression in (3.5) follows from equations (3.3)-(3.4), Lemma 3.1 and

the fact that v(x′, 0) = u(x′, 0) for x′ ∈ B∗
1.

Finally, the semiconvexity and semiconcavity follow from Proposition 2.2.

3.2. Regularity for σ on free boundary points. The next steps are very similar
to those in [Caf79] (and [MS08]), but we adapt them to the symmetrised solution
v instead of u. For completeness, we provide all the details. We begin with the
following lemma, corresponding to [Caf79, Lemma 2] (or [MS08, Lemma 3.3]).

In the next result, we call ϕ the extension of the obstacle to B1, i.e. ϕ(x′, xn) :=

ϕ(x′).

Lemma 3.3. Let v be the symmetrised solution (3.2). Let κ be a constant such that
κ > sup|ϕτ τ| for any τ a unit vector in Rn−1×{0}. Let x0 ∈ Ω ﬁxed and ψx0 denote
the function

Then, for any open set Ux0 such that x0 ∈ Ux0 ⊂ B1,

Proof. Deﬁne w = v − ψx0 and notice that by deﬁnition of ψx0 and the fact that v
is a supersolution for M−, we have w(x0) ≥ 0 and M−(D2w) ≤ 0. Therefore, we
can apply the maximum principle on Ux0 \ ∆ (recall ∆ is the coincidence set) and
use the symmetry of w to obtain that

sup

(v − ψx0) ≥ 0.

∂(Ux0 \∆)∩{xn≥0}

C 1,α ESTIMATES FOR THE FULLY NONLINEAR SIGNORINI PROBLEM

Now notice that on the set {v = u = ϕ} we have that ψx0 > ϕ, since x0 ∈ Ω and

κ > sup|ϕτ τ|. Thus, v − ψx0 < 0 on this set, so that

sup

i.e., ψ approximates w as η goes to 0.

Proof. Let us argue by contradiction. Suppose that there exists some ﬁxed ε > 0,

By Arzel`a-Ascoli, up to a subsequence, wk converges to some function ¯w uniformly
in B1, with k ¯wkL∞(B1) = 1. On the other hand, since Fk(0) = 0 and they are
uniformly elliptic and convex, they converge up to subsequences, uniformly over
compact sets, to some convex nonlinear operator ¯F uniformly elliptic with ellipticity
constants λ and Λ such that ¯F (0) = 0. Notice also that ψk converges uniformly to

Fk(D2(wk + ηk|xn|)) ≥ 0,

Now, passing to the limit, noticing that wk + ηk|xn| converges uniformly to ¯w and

using [CC95, Proposition 2.9], we immediately reach that, in the viscosity sense,

Repeating the same argument for wk − ηk|xn| we reach ¯F (D2 ¯w) ≤ 0 in B1, to ﬁnally
obtain

¯F (D2 ¯w) ≥ 0,

in B1.

¯F (D2 ¯w) = 0,

This implies ¯w = ¯ψ in B1, which is a contradiction with (3.14).

Using the previous results, we now give the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We separate the proof into three steps. In the ﬁrst step we

As in the proof of Lemma 3.6 we assume

to avoid having this constant on each estimate throughout the proof.

Notice that from Lemma 3.6 we know that there exists η > 0 such that

(3.16)
Up to replacing from the beginning u(x) by u(r0x) with r0 ≪ 1, we can make η as
small as necessary. The choice of the value of r0, and consequently the magnitude
in which the constant η is made small, will depend only on n, λ, and Λ.

|σ(x′)| ≤ η|x′|α,

kwk − lkkL∞(Bρ) ≤ kwk − vkkL∞(Bρ) + kvk − lkkL∞(Bρ)

≤ ε + Cρ2 ≤ ρ1+α,

where C depends only on n, λ, and Λ, ρ is chosen small enough depending only
on α, n, λ, and Λ so that Cρ2 ≤ 1
2ρ1+α, and η is chosen so that ε ≤ 1
2ρ1+α. It is
important to remark that the choice of η depends only on n, λ, and Λ.

Now, recalling the deﬁnition of wk, we reach

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
u − Lk − ρk(1+α)lk(cid:18) ·

ρk(cid:19)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞(Bρk+1 ) ≤ ρ(k+1)(1+α),

so that the inductive step is concluded by taking

ρk(cid:19) .
Lk+1(x) = Lk(x) + ρk(1+α)lk(cid:18) x

By noticing that there are bounds on the coeﬃcients of the linearisation of vk

depending only on n, λ, and Λ, the inequalities in (3.19) are obtained.

Once one has (3.17), (3.18), and (3.19), deﬁne L as the limit of Lk as k → ∞
(which exists, by (3.19)), and notice that, given any 0 < r = ρk for some k ∈ N,
then

ku − LkL∞(Br ) ≤ ku − LkkL∞(Br) +Xj≥k

kLj+1 − LjkL∞(Br) ≤ Cr1+α

for some C depending only on n, λ, and Λ; as we wanted.

Step 2: In this step we prove that the function σ deﬁned in (3.1)-(3.3) is C α(B∗
for some α = α(n, λ, Λ) > 0, and

(3.21)

for some constant C depending only on n, λ, and Λ.

We already know σ is regular in the interior of ∆∗ (by boundary estimates) and

Ω∗; respectively the coincidence set and its complement in B∗

the interior estimates σ ≡ 0 in Ω∗. From Lemma 3.6 we also obtain C α regularity
at points in ∂∆∗. Namely, we have that given (x′

0, 0) = x0 ∈ ∂∆∗,

|σ(x′)| ≤ C|x′ − x′

0|α, for x′ ∈ B∗
1,

(3.22)

for some constant C depending only on n, λ, and Λ.

Therefore, we only need to check that given x, y ∈ ∆, x = (x′, 0), y = (y′, 0), then

there exists some C depending only on n, λ, and Λ such that, if |x − y| = r,

|σ(x′) − σ(y′)| ≤ Crα.

Let R := dist(x, Ω) and suppose that dist(x, Ω) ≤ dist(y, Ω). Let z = (z′, 0), z′ ∈
∂∆∗, be such that dist(x, z) = dist(x, Ω), and assume that limxn↓0+ ∇u(z′, xn) = 0
and ∇x′ϕ(z′) = 0 by subtracting an aﬃne function if necessary. Notice that we can
do so because we already know from the ﬁrst step that u has a C 1,α estimate around
z′. Let us then separate two cases:

• If R < 4r, then using (3.21)

|σ(x′) − σ(y′)| ≤ |σ(x′) − σ(z′)| + |σ(y′) − σ(z′)|

≤ C (Rα + (R + r)α)
≤ Crα.

• In the case R ≥ 4r we need to use known boundary estimates for this fully

nonlinear problem and the previous step of the proof. Notice that x′, y′ ∈ B∗
B∗
R(x′) is thus a C 1,1 function, since u = ϕ there.
R(x′) ⊂ ∆∗, and u restricted to B∗
In particular, we use that under these hypotheses

R/2(x)) ≤ C(cid:16)oscB+

R (x)u + R2[ϕ]C 1,1(B∗

see, for example, [MS06, Proposition 2.2]. Now, remember that the gradient of u at
z is 0, so that from the previous step using the bound (3.15) around z,

|u(p) − ϕ(z′)| ≤ C|p − z|1+α ≤ CR1+α for p ∈ B+

R (x).

In particular, oscB+

R (x)u ≤ CR1+α, and thus, this yields

(3.23)

from which (3.21) is proved.

C 1,α(B+

R/2(x)) ≤ C,

Step 3: Our conclusion now follows by repeating Step 1 around every point on B∗
1.
Notice that in the ﬁrst step we only used that the origin was a free boundary point
to be able to apply Lemma 3.6 in (3.16).

Now, given any point z′ ∈ B∗

1/2, we can consider the function uz given by

where (xn)+ denotes the positive part of xn.

uz(x) := u(x) − σ(z′)(xn)+,

To ﬁnish the proof, we could now repeat a procedure like the one done in Step 2,
or directly notice that solutions to the nonlinear problem with C 1,α boundary data
are C 1,α up to the boundary (see, for example, [MS06, Proposition 2.2]).
(cid:3)

We ﬁnally give the:

Proof of Corollary 1.2. It is an immediate consequence of Theorem 1.1.
Indeed,
consider balls of radius R0 := dist(K, ∂D) around points on K ∩{xn = 0} and apply
Theorem 1.1. To cover the rest of K we use interior estimates, and the result follows
by noticing that kukL∞(D) ≤ kgkL∞(∂D) + kϕkL∞ by the maximum principle.
