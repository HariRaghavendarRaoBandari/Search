Abstract

Free-standing thin ﬁlms of magnetic ion intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides are produced using
ultramicrotoming techniques. Films of thicknesses ranging from 30 nm to 250 nm were achieved and char-
acterized using transmission electron diﬀraction and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism. Diﬀraction mea-
surements visualize the long range crystallographic ordering of the intercalated ions, while the dichroism
measurements directly assess the orbital contributions to the total magnetic moment. We thus verify the un-
quenched orbital moment in Fe0.25TaS2 and measure the fully quenched orbital contribution in Mn0.25TaS2.
Such ﬁlms can be used in a wide variety of ultrafast X-ray and electron techniques that beneﬁt from trans-
mission geometries, and allow measurements of ultrafast structural, electronic, and magnetization dynamics
in space and time.

1. Introduction

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are a
broad class of layered materials with a variety of
structural and electronic properties. Depending on
the speciﬁc compound and layer stacking, TMDCs
can exhibit metallic (e.g. TaS2), semi-metallic
(e.g. WTe2), semiconducting (e.g. MoSe2), or
insulating (e.g. HfS2) behaviour [1, 2]. Recent
work has focused on the emergence and dynamics
of charge density wave formation (commensurate
and incommensurate) concomitant with metal-to-
insulator transitions [3, 4]. Yet other work dealt
with the properties of monolayers of these mate-
rials. Loose interlayer bonding via van der Waals

forces allows the fabrication of single monolayers of
material which often exhibit electronic phases that
are starkly diﬀerent from bulk properties. Studies
on monolayers have brought forth possibilities in
optoelectronics and valleytronics [5, 6], and spin-
tronics [7].

The intrinsic properties of the bulk materials can
be further expanded by intercalation of atoms and
small molecules between the layers. In particular,
the incorporation of 3d transition metals results in
the onset of an array of magnetic properties which
can be tuned by intercalation concentration, choice
of intercalated species, and choice of host lattice
[8].
In total, the range of magnetic properties is
enormous, providing a platform on which to study
magnetism and domain structure as well as their
dynamics.

Here we discuss a sample preparation technique

that provides free-standing thin ﬁlms of magnetic
ion intercalated TaS2.
In thin ﬁlm form, these
samples open the possibility for a number of mag-
netization dynamics studies with new techniques
such as ultrafast electron diﬀraction [9, 10] and
microscopy [11], as well as X-ray absorption [12],
all of which beneﬁt from transmission geometries
where the penetration depth of both pump and
probe can be easily matched. Moreover, for X-
ray absorption studies, the transmission geometry
is the most robust when compared to its total elec-
tron yield (TIY) or ﬂuorescence yield (FY) counter-
parts in that it provides a direct measure of dichroic
absorption and is unaﬀected by electronic satura-
tion eﬀects [13]. The samples were prepared using
ultramicrotoming techniques [14], and their struc-
tural and magnetic properties were measured using
transmission electron diﬀraction and X-ray circu-
lar magnetic dichroism, respectively. Two diﬀerent
materials were studied, Mn0.25TaS2 and Fe0.25TaS2,
which diﬀer in their magnetic properties while shar-
ing the same structure.

2. Material Description

TMDCs (chemical formula MX2 where X is a
chalcogen and M a transition metal) consist of
stacks of X–M–X sandwich layers which are van
der Waals bonded along the c-axis [15]. Variations
in layer stacking result in a wide range of physical
properties, while particular stacking conﬁgurations
promote intercalation. For TaS2, the metallic 2H
polytype facilitates intercalation. Upon intercala-
tion, the new chemical formula is AyMX2, which in
the context of TMDCs is understood to maintain
the MX2 structure, while new ions are incorporated
between the host layers. The process of 3d ion inter-
calation occurs during the growth phase, for exam-
ple using iodine vapor transport. Interestingly, par-
ticular intercalant concentrations lead to long-range
crystalline order of intercalants between the host
layers. This is the case for two situations, that of
intercalant density y = 1/4 and y = 1/3, where the
intercalants form an ordered 2×2 or
3 super-
lattice, respectively [8, 16, 17]. When such ordered
states occur, the intercalated ion is known to re-
side in speciﬁc sites of the host lattice (the trigonal
antiprismatic hollow site between the layers of 2H -
TaS2), ensuring that the local environment of the
magnetic ion is unchanged as one varies the inter-
calant species or host lattice. A three-dimensional
view of the crystallographic structure is shown in

the intercalant ion between X–M–X sheets. The
crystallization of intercalants is best visualized in a
planar view along the c-axis, as shown in Fig. 1(b).
Bulk materials are characterized by Curie tem-
peratures of 80 K for Mn0.25TaS2 [8] and 155 K [18]
for Fe0.25TaS2. The large intercalant-intercalant
distance inhibits direct exchange mechanisms, and
an indirect RKKY interaction is understood to play
a crucial role [8, 19].
In this case, the exchange
interaction between local moments is mediated by
the conduction electrons of the host lattice. The
isolated ions thus exhibit structural aspects remi-
niscent of local-moment magnetic systems. At the
same time, there are indications of itinerant mag-
netism in Mn0.25TaS2 due to a strong hybridisation
between the intercalant’s 3d states with the Ta 5dz2
states which form the conduction band [20]. This
class of materials thus bridges the divide between
truly local-moment magnetism (as in 4f systems)
and itinerant ferromagnetism observed in 3d tran-
sition metals.

The two materials are further distinguished by
their magnetic orientation. While Mn0.25TaS2 is
an easy plane ferromagnet with low coercivity [21],
Fe0.25TaS2 exhibits a strong out-of-plane magnetic
anisotropy with high coercivity [22]. Additionally,

a large orbital contribution to the magnetization,
while the orbital contribution in Mn0.25TaS2 is fully
quenched.

3. Preparation of Free-Standing Thin Films

TMDCs can be readily thinned down to mono-
layer thickness using the ‘scotch tape method’ [1],
as well as by lithium intercalation [23] or by ultra-
soniﬁcation [24]. However, due to charge transfer
from the intercalant to the host and a concomi-
tant change of the interlayer bonding towards a co-
valent bond [25], standard cleaving methods must
be abandoned in the case of 3d ion intercalated
TMDCs. To our knowledge, there have been no re-
ports of exfoliation of thin samples of Mn0.25TaS2
and Fe0.25TaS2.

Recently, the preparation of free-standing ﬁlms
of 1T -TaS2 using an ultramicrotome was reported
[26]. The resulting ﬁlms had lateral dimensions
of ∼ 200 µm and thickness of 30 nm. On the ba-
sis of supporting transmission electron microscope
(TEM) diﬀraction images, it has been shown that
the crystallinity of the sample and the transition
temperatures between the diﬀerent charge density
wave phases are unaﬀected, and that the prepara-
tion principle is suitable for making thin TMDC
samples. Following this demonstration, we applied
similar methodologies, however here to the more
strongly bonded 3d ion intercalated TMDCs.

Following standard techniques used in speci-
men sectioning [14], we embedded Mn0.25TaS2 and
Fe0.25TaS2 bulk crystals with lateral dimensions
of ∼ 500 µm in transparent epoxy (Epoﬁx Cold-
Setting Embedding Resin) for cutting in a Leica
EM UC6 ultramicrotome. After mixing resin and
hardener, the epoxy was heated for a few minutes
in an oven at 60 ◦C in order to lower its viscosity
and remove air bubbles. Afterwards, we covered
the bottom of 15 mm × 7 mm-sized molds with a
thin epoxy ﬁlm and cured the epoxy for ∼ 30 min
at 60 ◦C. Then we cut scratches in the epoxy lay-
ers using a razor blade, introduced bulk crystals in
an upright position and ﬁlled the rest of the molds
with epoxy. After another ∼ 3 h of curing at 60 ◦C,
the epoxy blocks were ready for sectioning. Epoxy
blocks were trimmed to expose the ab-plane of the
sample material. After pre-sectioning with a glass
knife, a diamond knife (dEYEmond ULTRA 45°)
was used to produce thin sections from the block

3

face. These were transferred onto square mesh cop-
per TEM grids using a metallic loop suspending the
sections in a thin water ﬁlm (‘perfect loop’). As
read out from the ultramicrotome settings, we were
able to obtain large area sections from 250 nm down
to 30 nm in thickness. We found that Mn0.25TaS2
was more easily sectioned than Fe0.25TaS2, which
had a tendency to disintegrate during cutting. We
attribute this to deformations of the Fe0.25TaS2 lat-
tice induced during the clipping of a small fraction
from a spatially more extended crystal platelet. For
Mn0.25TaS2 in contrast, we had suitably sized bulk
crystals available from the start.

4. Characterization

4.1. Optical Microscopy

Optical microscopy was conducted for every sam-
ple, representative images of which are shown in
Fig. 1(c) and (d). The sectioned samples showed
large lateral areas of several hundreds of microns
for Mn0.25TaS2 and slightly smaller for Fe0.25TaS2,
and a good adhesion to the grids.

In the optical images, we can identify regions of
the samples that appear grooved. This is most
easily seen as horizontal lines near the bottom of
Fig. 1(c). The grooves correspond to the cutting
direction of the ultramicrotome and indicate im-
perfections that develop during multiple uses of the
diamond knife. In Ref. [26], it is suggested that this
is caused by a reaction of the tantalum with the dia-
mond blade. In our studies, we did not use a virgin
knife, and thus we are unable to classify the origin
of the knife damage. However, over the course of
many cuts, we note that the density of scratches
and nicks in the blade did not noticeably increase,
while the sample quality remained unchanged.

4.2. Transmission Electron Diﬀraction

In order to verify the crystallinity of the sectioned
samples, and particularly to investigate the order-
ing of intercalated ions, we recorded selected area
electron diﬀraction (SAED) patterns in a TEM. Im-
ages recorded at 200 keV electron energy are shown
in Fig. 2. For Fe0.25TaS2, a thinner edge region was
required in order to clearly witness a nice diﬀrac-
tion pattern. Importantly, both diﬀraction patterns
exhibit the expected superlattice reﬂections mid-
way between the structural reﬂections of the host
lattice, indicative of the 2 × 2 ordering of the in-
tercalants. Furthermore, we observe no sign of a

of (a) 50 nm sample of Mn0.25TaS2, and (b) 200 nm sample
of Fe0.25TaS2. Weak superlattice spots are visible in both
diﬀraction patterns halfway between the structural reﬂec-
tions of 2H -TaS2. The images are scaled to accommodate
diﬀerent camera lengths.

3 superlattice which would emerge in case of
intercalant excess or disorder [27]. In general, good
quality diﬀraction patterns were acquired on the
thinnest samples (XMCD measurements discussed
below can be performed on all sample thicknesses),
while Mn0.25TaS2 showed better spatial homogene-
ity in intercalant concentration than Fe0.25TaS2.

4.3. XMCD Spectroscopy

To assess

the magnetic properties of

the
thinned samples, X-ray magnetic circular dichro-
ism (XMCD) measurements in a transmission ge-
ometry were performed using the ALICE chamber
at beamline PM3 of the BESSY II synchrotron at
Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. The ALICE chamber
features a liquid helium cooled sample holder and
an electromagnet, both of which rotate with respect
to the incoming beam direction and facilitate the
study of both out-of-plane and in-plane magneti-
zation characteristics. Details on the broader ver-
satility of ALICE can be found in Ref. [28]. Mea-
surements were conducted at a range of tempera-
tures below the respective Curie temperatures of
the two samples. Full spectroscopic information
over the L3,2 absorption edges of Fe and Mn was
collected. Since XMCD is sensitive to the magne-
tization component parallel to the X-ray wave vec-
tor, measurements of Fe0.25TaS2 were performed at
normal incidence, while Mn0.25TaS2 (and the ap-
plied ﬁeld) was rotated by an angle Θ with respect
to the X-ray beam direction to maximize the pro-
jection of the magnetization onto the X-ray wave
vector. Rotation angles achieved did not exceed
40° from normal. For a ﬁxed X-ray helicity, the
direction of the magnetic ﬁeld was switched, and

for two orientations of applied magnetic ﬁeld. The sample
and applied ﬁeld were rotated 40° with respect to the incom-
ing beam for Mn0.25TaS2, while Fe0.25TaS2 was acquired at
normal incidence. XMCD spectra are shown in blue. The
asymmetry in L3 and L2 for the case of Fe0.25TaS2 indicates
a large unquenched orbital moment.

the transmitted intensity was acquired for oppo-
sitely magnetized ﬁlms, denoted as I+ and I−, from
which we calculate the absorption cross sections
µ± = − log (I±/I0) for the two magnetization di-
rections (I0 is the incident photon ﬂux).

Figure 3 shows representative X-ray absorption
spectra µ± (red) for Mn0.25TaS2 and Fe0.25TaS2
across the respective L3,2 edges for both orienta-
tions of the magnetic ﬁeld. Included in the ﬁgure
is the extracted XMCD signal µXMCD (blue) for the
two materials, calculated following standard treat-
ments for XMCD analysis [29, 30]:

µXMCD(E) =

γ cos (Θ)

[µ+(E) − µ−(E)]

(1)

The XMCD signal has been corrected for both angle
of incidence Θ and degree of helicity of the source
γ. We used γ ≈ .925 which is characteristic for the
oﬀ-axis emission of the bend magnet radiation at
beamline PM3 (speciﬁcally at the Fe L edge) [31].
A cursory comparison between the XMCD spec-
tra for the two materials unveils a notable diﬀer-
ence, namely, the integrated intensity of the L3,2
edges are vastly diﬀerent. As is well known from
XMCD analysis, diﬀerences in the integrated inten-
sity at the two edges is a manifestation of varying
degrees of spin and orbital contributions to the to-
tal magnetization.

The measured ratio of orbital to spin magnetic mo-
ment for Fe0.25TaS2 is found to be .39 ± .04 and
in close agreement with previously obtained val-
ues of .33 [19]. Meanwhile the measured value for
Mn0.25TaS2 is −.06 ± .06, which to our knowledge
is the ﬁrst direct measurement of the fully quenched
orbital moment in this material. The results and
corresponding error bars are derived from the en-
semble of measurements below 50 K and 110 K for
Mn0.25TaS2 and Fe0.25TaS2, respectively.

As a ﬁnal measurement, hysteresis curves were
obtained at the peak of the L3 edge for both sam-
ples, as shown in Fig. 4. In the case of Mn0.25TaS2,
the hysteresis vanishes above 90 K, in close agree-
ment with our independent measurements on the
bulk samples prior to sectioning (TC = 96 K) using
a magnetic property measurement system (MPMS).
This lies 10 K above the literature value of 80 K [8]
mentioned at the outset and indicates good sam-
ple quality, since oﬀ-stoichiometry drastically re-
duces the ferromagnetic transition temperature in
3d ion intercalated TMDCs [32]. For Fe0.25TaS2,
we measure a Curie temperature of ∼ 110 K, which
agrees reasonably well with our independent MPMS
measurements on the bulk samples (in zero-ﬁeld-
cooled measurements, we witness a broad transi-
tion region extending from 160 K to 120 K). How-
ever, the measured transition temperature lies be-
low the literature value of 155 K [18] for phase pure
Fe0.25TaS2, and is likely indicative of regions of oﬀ-
stoichiometry [32]. This is also corroborated by our
SAED results which indicate a degree of spatial in-
homogeneity. Nonetheless, the expected high coer-
civity of the iron intercalated sample as compared
to the manganese intercalated sample is clearly vis-
ible.

ple of Mn0.25TaS2, and (b) 200 nm sample of Fe0.25TaS2.

5. Conclusion and Outlook

In conclusion, we prepared free-standing thin
ﬁlms of magnetic ion intercalated transition metal
dichalcogenides using ultramicrotoming techniques.
Thicknesses ranging between 30 nm and 250 nm
were achieved and characterized by transmission
electron diﬀraction and XMCD spectroscopy. Us-
ing transmission electron diﬀraction, we witness the
intercalant 2 × 2 crystallographic ordering in both
materials, a characteristic of the intercalation con-
centration y = 1/4. Using XMCD spectroscopy,
we measured the orbital contribution to the total
magnetization for the two materials. Thin ﬁlms fa-
cilitate true absorption measurements, and are pre-
ferred for quantitative measurements over ﬂuores-
cence and electron yield geometries. This has al-
lowed us to verify the unquenched orbital moment
in Fe0.25TaS2, as well as the fully quenched orbital
moment in Mn0.25TaS2.

Looking ahead, we note that thin ﬁlms of inter-
calated dichalcogenides have wide applicability in
time-resolved X-ray and electron diﬀraction stud-
ies.
In both cases, the sample thickness can be
optimized to easily match the absorption depth
of both pump and probe pulses, ensuring that
measurements are performed on uniformly excited
materials. With respect to time-resolved XMCD
[33, 34], we foresee the capability of measuring mag-
netization dynamics of ‘local moment’ orbital and
spin components on the intercalant site, as well as
dynamics of itinerant conduction electrons of the
host lattice (measured at a suitable host absorption

electrons acquire a modest spin polarization which
we expect exhibits diﬀerent magnetization dynam-
ics. In the broader context of intercalated dichalco-
genides, as one measures dynamics in a variety of
members of this family, the orbital, spin, and con-
duction electron contribution to the total magneti-
zation can be varied, providing a robust platform
on which to study ultrafast magnetism.

Finally, we also envisage a range of time-resolved
coherent X-ray scattering measurements to re-
solve the dynamics of magnetic domains on sub-
picosecond timescales, and length scales of a few
tens of nanometers.
For the case of ultrafast
transmission electron microscopy (UTEM) [35, 36],
thin magnetic ﬁlms open the door to ultrafast
Lorentz microscopy, thus providing a measure of
magnetic domain motion and domain wall dynam-
ics on timescales approaching femtoseconds, and
spatial length scales of a few nanometers [37].
