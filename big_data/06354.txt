The Buda-Lund model describes an expanding hydrodynamical system with ellipsoidal symmetry
and ﬁts the observed elliptic ﬂow and oscillating HBT radii successfully. The ellipsoidal symmetry
can be characterized by the second order harmonics of the transverse momentum distribution, and it
can be also observed in the azimuthal oscillation of the HBT radii measured versus the second order
reaction plane. The model may have to be changed to describe the experimentally indicated higher
order asymmetries. In this paper we detail an extension of the Buda Lund hydro model to investigate
higher order ﬂow harmonics and the triangular dependence of the azimuthally sensitive HBT radii.

1. Introduction

The investigation of the correlation functions is a useful tool to measure properties of the strongly
interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) such as the size or the asymmetries of the medium. The method
originally had been discovered by Hanbury-Brown and Twiss [1] in radioastronomy and Goldhaber et.
al. developed it to measure the size of the source in heavy ion reactions [2].
If the system is not
spherically symmetric there could be azimuthal dependence of the HBT radii. In the framework of
the Buda-Lund model the 2nd order oscillation of these radii can be investigated (see [3]) but the
experiments show that (e.g.
in [4]) there are triangular (3rd order) oscillations too. To observed the
azimuthal dependence of the radii it has to be investigated in the corresponding reaction plane. In the
extended Buda-Lund model v3 has non-zero value contrary to the elliptical one and the third order
oscillation amplitudes can be investigated too.

Generally the source function assumed in hydrodynamical model is

sQGP there are two kinds of asymmetries that can be important to understand the phenomenology of
the dynamics, the asymmetry of the space-time distribution and the velocity ﬁeld distribution. The
asymmetry of the space-time distribution is ensured by a scale parameter s. An example spatial dis-
tribution is shown in Fig. 1. We can generalize the model through this parameter.

Let us write up s in a cylindrical coordinate system instead of Cartesian with r2 = r2
cos(ϕ) = rx

r , and prescribe the azimuthal angle dependence. A general case can be written up like:

x + r2

y and

s =

The ellipsoidal case corresponds to n = 2. There is a known solution of the hydrodynamics with
similar generalization of the s in Ref. [5] however in that solution the velocity ﬁeld distribution was
not generalized to arbitrary asymmetry. We can generalize the velocity ﬁeld in the present framework
with the generalization of the velocity ﬁeld potential Φ, deﬁned as uµ = γ(1,∇Φ). A general case can
be expressed:

(Ref. [5]) is in the center ﬁgure where the value of the asymmetry parameter is 3 = 0.5. On the right hand
side there is the triangular ﬂow pattern with χ3 = 0.2

3. Observables

The invariant transverse momentum distribution, the n-order ﬂows and the azimuthally sensitive
HBT radii can be derived from the model. The asymmetries and their eﬀects on the observables can be
investigated versus the proper reaction plane. If we explore quantities respect to the 2nd order reaction
plane we have to average on the angle between the 2nd and 3rd order reaction plane and vice versa.
The ﬂow coeﬃcients can be obtained from the Fourier-series of the invariant momentum distribution
and can be expressed in the form vn(pt) = (cid:104)cos(nα)(cid:105)N1(p). The investigations show that the n-th order
asymmetry coeﬃcients aﬀect only the n-th order ﬂow, however both of the spatial and the velocity
ﬁeld asymmetry have eﬀects. For example 2 and χ2 has eﬀect on the v2 but has no eﬀect on v3. This

asymmetry so the values of these cannot be extracted only from the measurements of the ﬂows.
The azimuthally sensitive HBT radii are important in the survey of the geometry and the size of the
source. Generally the two particle momentum correlation function can be expressed as the Fourier-
transform of the source function. Based on Ref. [7] the HBT radii can be calculated as

where rout = r cos(ϕ− α)− βtt and rside = r sin(ϕ− α), ϕ is the spatial angle and α is the momentum

angle. Average (cid:104)·(cid:105) means for example (cid:104)r(cid:105) =(cid:82) rS(x, p)d4x where in our case S(x, p) is deﬁned in Eq.

(1). We can calculate the azimuthal angle dependence of the HBT radii from Eq. (4) and parametrize
them with the following functions:

side = (cid:104)r2

side(cid:105) − (cid:104)rside(cid:105)2

Elliptical case: R2
Triangular case: R2

out = R2
out = R2

o,0 + R2
o,0 + R2

o,2 cos(2α) + R2
o,3 cos(3α) + R2

o,4 cos(4α) + R2
o,6 cos(6α) + R2

o,6 cos(6α)
o,9 cos(9α)

(6)

The additional terms are caused by the rotation to the (out, side, long) system as it detailed in Ref. [8].
These amplitudes are aﬀected by both of the asymmetry parameters so there is also a mixing in this
case. Yielding the value of the parameters from only the azimuthally sensitive HBT radii measurements
is not possible but combined with the ﬂow measurements the value of the asymmetry coeﬃcients can
be determined.

4. Summary and acknowledgements

We can generalized the space-time and velocity ﬁeld distribution in the framework of the Buda-Lund
hydro model. Observables can be derived from the extended model and the eﬀects of the higher order
asymmetries can be investigated on the ﬂows and the azimuthally sensitive HBT radii. However there
is a mixing between the diﬀerent type of the asymmetry coeﬃcients but combining the measurements
together could be a method to disentangle the value of these parameters. This work was partially
supported by the OTKA NK 101438 grant.
