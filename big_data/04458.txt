Abstract

The site reduction of U(1) lattice gauge theory is used to model the dynam-

ics of magnetic monopoles. The reduced lattice theory is the 1D plane-rotator

model of the angle-valued coordinates on the discrete world-line. The energy

spectrum is obtained exactly, with a minimum in the ground-state at coupling
gc = 1.125. For g < gc and T < Tc = 0.247/a the model exhibits two phases
of real and imaginary velocities, like particles facing a potential barrier. In

the gauge theory side the real velocity phase corresponds to magnetic energy

exceeding the electric energy, indicating the dominance of monopole density.
For g > gc or T > Tc the monopoles always dominate.

According to string theory the gauge ﬁelds and coordinates are interchanged
In particular, upon the compactiﬁcations some

directions of space, the gauge ﬁelds arising from open strings would emerge as the
transverse coordinates of Dp-branes in the dual compactiﬁed space, leading to the
correspondence [1, 2]

Ai ←→ Xi/l2

Y M = λ−1

in which ls is the string theory length. Dp-branes are proposed to represent the
solutions of the eﬀective ﬁeld theory, possessing charge and mass proportional to
the inverse string coupling λs, similar to gauge theory magnetic monopoles with
m ∝ g−2
s . The dynamics of the coordinates Xi’s is captured by a theory
resulted from dimensional reduction of the ordinary gauge theory for Ai’s (now
Xi’s) to the world-volume of D-branes [1, 3]. In the case of D0-branes, all spatial
components of the gauge ﬁeld would appear as the time dependent space coordinates
of D0-branes [1].
In the case of N Dp-branes, the transverse coordinates would
appear as N dimensional hermitian matrices [3].

It is reasonable to look for the application of the correspondence between gauge
ﬁelds and coordinates at strong coupling regime.
In this way the lattice gauge
theories are the natural candidates, as they have shown their capacity to capture the
essential features expected at strong coupling limit [4]. Interestingly, in the lattice
formulation of gauge theories the gauge ﬁelds appear to be periodic variables [4], as
the same is expected generally for the coordinates of Dp-branes [1]. Accordingly,
here the aim is to adapt the above correspondence for the lattice gauge theories and
to look for possible implications. The pure gauge sector of compact U(1) theory on
4D Euclidean lattice is given by [4]:

In the process of dimensional reduction the dependence on spatial directions is re-
moved, and the spatial components of the gauge ﬁelds are interpreted as coordinates
Xi’s. Based on (1) we assume the following between dimensionless quantities:

which is the sum of three copies of the Hamiltonian of the 1D plane-rotator model of
magnetic systems. In fact the close relation between lattice gauge theories and spin
systems was recognized from the ﬁrst appearance of lattice gauge theories [4,5], and
has been used widely for better understanding the gauge theory side. In particular,
the so-called Villain model [6], as an approximation to the plane-rotator model, was
used for gauge theory purposes [7–9]. Here the model is interpreted as a discrete
world-line endowed by the compact coordinates xi’s

This action describes the dynamics of a free particle with mass m0 = a/(g2R2).
It is mentioned, as far as the dependence on coupling constant is concerned, this
mass corresponds to that of a magnetic monopole. We will see shortly that the
emergent dynamics by action (7) supports the correspondence with monopoles as
well. Following [4] it is useful to deﬁne the new variables yi = xi/R taking values in

Most interestingly about the spectrum (21) is the behavior of the energy of
ground-state for diﬀerent values of coupling constant g. In fact the lowest energy
E0(κ) has a minimum at the critical value κc = 0.790 (see Fig. 1). The existence
of this minimum implies that at suﬃciently low temperature the mean-value of the
conjugate variable would encounter a change in its sign for κ ≈ κc. At temperatures
T (cid:28) E1(κc) − E0(κc), in which even the ﬁrst excited state is not accessible, the
one-particle partition function takes the form

Z1(κ) (cid:39) exp(−E0(κ)/T )

This result shows that for κ > κc the velocity ˙x is an imaginary number. This
situation is quite similar to the case when particles inside a barrier have potential

As a consequence, although the particles have ﬁnite density inside the barrier, they
are not detectable. For κ < κc instead, the particles have the ordinary behavior and
are directly detectable.

The implication of the above behavior on the original lattice gauge theory is as

follows. By the conjugate variable of κ = g−2 in the ﬁeld theory side we expect

which is interpreted as the dominance of the density of magnetic monopoles in the
deﬁning vacuum of the theory. This is an evidence for the picture by which the
reduced model is in fact describing the monopoles of the gauge theory. According
to the dual Meissner eﬀect scenario for the conﬁned phase of gauge theories [11–13],
the phase with (33) should be the conﬁned one, in which the abundantly available
monopoles prevent spreading of the electric ﬁelds originated from electric charges.
In fact the theoretical studies [5, 7–9] as well as several lattice simulations [14] have
found strong evidence for such a phase transition in U(1) compact lattice theory.

At higher temperatures the excited states make contributions to the partition
function, leading to diﬀerent behaviors in the mean-value (28) (see Fig. 2). There
is a critical temperature Tc = 0.246 a−1 above which whatever the coupling is the
mean-value is positive, meaning that at suﬃciently high temperatures the monopoles
always are detectable. One can present the whole picture in a T -g phase diagram
for the mean-value (32) (see Fig. 3).

Setting a2R2 → l4
s, the above action is known as the matrix dynamics governing the
dynamics of N 0-branes [1,3], with the interpretation that the N 2− N extra degrees
encoded in matrices are capturing the dynamics of strings stretched between 0-
branes. In a series of works, it has been suggested that the 0-brane matrix dynamics
is used to model the bound-states of quarks and emergent QCD-strings [15–17]. It
is argued that the matrix coordinate description of gauge variables might generate
the stringy aspects expected from gauge theories, without the need to treat the
world-sheet anomalies encountered in the non-critical space-time dimensions. The
relevance of matrix coordinates to non-Abelian theories has been discussed in [17,18].
The symmetry aspects of the above picture is discussed in [19].

By the action (36) the analytic expressions as the U(1) case are not expected.
Instead, the numerical analysis are certainly possible, and expected to give more
information about the phase structure of non-Abelian gauge theories.
