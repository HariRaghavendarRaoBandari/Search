Quantum diﬀusion in the Kronig-Penney model

Abstract

In this paper we consider the 1D Schr¨odinger operator H with periodic point
interactions. We show an L1 − L∞ bound for the time evolution operator e−itH
restricted to each energy band with decay order O(t−1/3) as t → ∞, which comes
from some kind of resonant state. The order O(t−1/3) is optimal for our model.
We also give an asymptotic bound for the coeﬃcient in the high energy limit. For
the proof, we give an asymptotic analysis for the band functions and the Bloch
waves in the high energy limit. Especially we give the asymptotics for the inﬂection
points in the graphs of band functions, which is crucial for the asymptotics of the
coeﬃcient in our estimate.

Introduction

The one-electron models of solids are based on the study of Schr¨odinger operator with
periodic potential. There are a lot of studies on the periodic potential, in particular, for
periodic point interactions, we can show the spectral set explicitly (Albeverio et. al. [2]
is the best guide to this ﬁeld for readers). Most fundamental case is the one-dimensional
Schr¨odinger operator with periodic point interactions, called the Kronig–Penney model
(see Kronig–Penney [10]), given by

H = −

d2
dx2 + V

∞

Xj=−∞

δ(x − j) on L2(R),

(1)

where V is a non-zero real constant, and δ(· − j) is the Dirac delta measure at j ∈
Z. The positive sign of V corresponds the repulsive interaction, while the negative
one corresponds the attractive one. More precisely, H is the negative Laplacian with
boundary conditions on integer points:

H = −

where

D = {u ∈ H 1(R) ∩ H 2(R \ Z) : u′(j+) − u′(j−) = V u(j), j ∈ Z}.

(3)
Here u(j±) = limǫ→+0 u(j ± ǫ) and H p(Ω) is the usual Sobolev space of order p on the
open set Ω. From Sobolev’s embedding theorem H 1(R) ֒→ C 0
b (R), every elements of D
are continuous (classical sense) and uniformly bounded functions. It is well-known that
H is self-adjoint [4, 2] and is a model describing electrons on the quantum wire. The
spectrum of this model is explicitly given by

σ(H) =nE ∈ R : −2 ≤ D(√E) ≤ 2o ,

(4)

where

D(k) = 2 cos k + V

k

sin k

.

D(k) is so-called discriminant and D(√E) can be regarded as an entire function with
respect to E ∈ C. The spectrum σ(H) of H consists of inﬁnitely many closed intervals
(spectral bands) and is purely absolutely continuous.
On the other hand, for the Schr¨odinger operator H = −∆ + V on Rd with decaying
potential V , the dispersive estimate for the Schr¨odinger time evolution operator e−itH is
stated as follows:

kPace−itHukLp(Rd) ≤ C|t|−d( 1
(2 < p ≤ ∞, 1/p + 1/q = 1),

2 − 1

p )kukLq(Rd),

u ∈ L2(Rd) ∩ Lq(Rd)

(5)

where Pac denotes the spectral projection to the absolutely continuous subspace for H.
The dispersive estimate is a quantitative representation of the diﬀusion phenomena in
quantum mechanics, and is extensively studied recently, because of its usefulness in
the theory of the non-linear Schr¨odinger operator (see e.g. Journ´e–Soﬀer–Sogge [11],
Weder [18], Yajima [17], Mizutani [12], and references therein). The estimate (5) is
also obtained in the case of the one-dimensional point interaction. Adami–Sacchetti [1]
obtain (5) when V is one point δ potential, and so do Kovaˇr´ık–Sacchetti [9] when V is
the sum of δ potentials at two points. The motivation of the present paper is to obtain a
similar estimate for our periodic model (1). Though this problem is quite fundamental,
we could not ﬁnd such kind of results in the literature, probably because the deduction
of the result requires a detailed analysis of the band functions, as we shall see below.

Since the spectrum of the Schr¨odinger operator with periodic potential is absolutely
continuous, one may expect some dispersion type estimate holds also in this case. How-
ever, there seems to be few results about the dispersive type estimate for the time
evolution operator of the diﬀerential equation with periodic coeﬃcients.1 An example is
the paper by Cuccagna [3], in which the Klein–Gordon equation

utt + Hu + µu = 0, H = −
ut(0, x) = g(x)
u(0, x) = 0,

d2
dx2 + P (x) on R,

1Some authors study the pointwise asymptotics for the integral kernel of the time evolution operator
in the large time limit; see e.g. Korotyaev [8] and references therein. But we could not ﬁnd the dispersive
type estimate for the periodic Schr¨odinger operator itself in the literature.

is considered, where P (x) is a smooth real-valued periodic function with period 1.
Cuccagna proves the solution u(t, x) satisﬁes

ku(t,·)kL∞(R) ≤ Cµhti−1/3kg(·)kW 1,1(R),

hti = √1 + t2

(6)

for µ ∈ (0,∞) \ D, where D is some bounded discrete set. The peculiar power −1/3
comes from the following reason. The integral kernel for the time evolution operator is
written as the sum of oscillatory integrals

Kn,t(x, y) =

1

2πZ π

−π

e−it(λn(θ)−sθ)an(θ, x′, y′) dθ

(n = 1, 2, . . .),

(7)

where x = [x] + x′, y = [y] + y′, [x], [y] ∈ Z, x′, y′ ∈ (0, 1), and s = ([x] − [y])/t. The
function λn(θ) is called the band function for the n-th band, which is a real-analytic
function of θ with period 2π. In the large time limit t → ∞, it is well-known that the
main contribution of the oscillatory integral (7) comes from the part nearby the stationary
phase point θs (the solution of λ′
n(θ) = s), and the stationary phase method tells us the
principal term in the asymptotic bound is a constant multiple of |λ′′
n(θs)|−1/2t−1/2 (see
e.g. Stein [15, Chapter VIII] or Lemma 15 below). However, since λn(θ) is a periodic
function, there exists a point θ0 so that λ′′
n(θ0) = 0. If the stationary phase point θs
coincides with θ0, then the previous bound no longer makes sense. Instead, the stationary
phase method concludes the principal term is a constant multiple of |λ(3)
n (θ0)|−1/3t−1/3.
Since the integral kernel of our operator has the same form as (7) (see (125) below), we
expect a result similar to (6) also holds in our case.

Let us formulate our main result. Let H be the Hamiltonian for the Kronig-Penney
model given in (2) and (3). As stated above, the spectrum of H has the band structure,
that is,

∞

σ(H) =

In,

[n=1

where the n-th band In is a closed interval of ﬁnite length (for the precise deﬁnition, see
(22) below). Our main result is as follows.

Theorem 1. Let Pn be the spectral projection onto the n-th energy band In. Then,

for suﬃciently large n, there exist positive constants C1,n and C2,n such that

for any u ∈ L1(R) and any t ∈ R, where hti = √1 + t2. The coeﬃcients obey the bound

(cid:13)(cid:13)Pne−itH u(cid:13)(cid:13)L∞ ≤ (C1,nhti−1/2 + C2,nhti−1/3)kukL1

(8)

C1,n = O(1), C2,n = O(n−1/9)

as n → ∞.
The power −1/2 in the ﬁrst term of the coeﬃcient in (8) is the same as in (5) with d = 1
and p = ∞, since it comes from the states corresponding to the energy near the band
center, which behaves like a free particle. This fact can be understood from the graph

3

of λ = λn(θ) (Figure 1).2 The part of the graph corresponding to the band center is
similar to the parabola λ = θ2 or its translation, which is the band function for the free
Hamiltonian H0 = −d2/dx2. On the other hand, the power −1/3 comes from part of the
integral (7) given by

˜Kn,t(x, y) =

1

2πZJn

e−it(λn(θ)−sθ)an(θ, x′, y′) dθ,

(9)

where Jn is some open set including two solutions θ0 to the equation λ′′
n(θ) = 0. Notice
that (θ0, λn(θ0)) is an inﬂection point in the graph of λ = λn(θ); see Figure 1. The
estimates for the coeﬃcients are obtained from the lower bounds for the derivatives of
λn(θ). Actually, we can choose Jn so that

inf

θ∈[−π,π]\Jn |λ′′

n(θ)| ≥ C,

θ∈Jn |λ(3)
inf

n (θ)| ≥ Cn1/3,

(10)

where C is a positive constant independent of n. By (10) and the estimates for the
amplitude function (Proposition 14), we can prove Theorem 1 by using a lemma for
estimating oscillatory integrals, given in Stein’s book (see Stein [15, page 334] or Lemma
15 below). We can also prove the power −1/3 is optimal, by considering the case s =
λ′(θ0) (so, θ0 is a stationary phase point), and applying the asymptotic expansion formula
in the stationary phase method (see e.g. Stein [15, Page 334]).

Figure 1: The graphs of the band functions λ = λn(θ) (n = 1, 2, 3) for V > 0. The range
of λn(θ) is the n-th band In. We ﬁnd two inﬂection points of λ = λn(θ) near (nπ, (nπ)2),
for every n.

2All the graphs are written by using Mathematica 9.0.

The physical implication of the result is as follows. By deﬁnition, the parameter
s = ([x] − [y])/t represents the propagation velocity of a quantum particle. The wave
packet with energy near λ(θ0) has the maximal group speed in the n-th band, and the
speed of the quantum diﬀusion is slowest in that band. Thus such state has a bit longer
life-span (in the sense of L∞-norm) than the ordinary state has; the state is in some sense
a resonant state, caused by the meeting of two stationary phase points θs as s tends to
s0 = λ′(θ0). It is well-known that the existence of resonant states makes the decay of
the solution with respect to t slower (see Jensen–Kato [6] or Mizutani [12]).

Since the estimate (8) is given bandwise, it is natural to ask we can obtain the
dispersive type estimate for the whole Schr¨odinger time evolution operator e−itH , like
Cuccagna’s result (6). However, it turns out to be diﬃcult in the present case, from the
following reason. A reasonable strategy to prove such estimate is as follows. First, we
divide the integral Kn,t into two parts ˜Kn,t and the rest, where ˜Kn,t is given in (9) with Jn
some open set including θ = 0,±π. Next, we show the sum of ˜Kn,t converges and gives
O(t−1/3), and the sum of the rests also converges and gives O(t−1/2). However, for ﬁxed
x and y, we ﬁnd that our upper bound for ˜Kn,t(x, y) is not better than O(n−1t−1/2),
and the sum of the upper bounds does not converge (see the last part of Section 4).
One reason for this divergence is very strong singularity of our potential, the sum of
δ-functions. Because of this singularity, the width of the band gap, say gn (n is the band
number), does not decay at all in the high energy limit n → ∞.3 Then we cannot take
the open set Jn so small,4 and the sum of the lengths |Jn| diverges; if this sum converges,
we can use a simple bound | ˜Kn,t| ≤ C|Jn| to control the sum. Thus we do not succeed
to obtain a bound for the sum of ˜Kn,t(x, y) at present.
On the other hand, for the Schr¨odinger operator H = −d2/dx2 + V on R1 with real-
valued periodic potential V , it is known that the decay rate of the width of the band
gap gn reﬂects the smoothness of the potential V . Hochstadt [5] says gn = o(n−(m−1)) if
V is in C m, and Trubowitz [16] says gn = O(e−cn) (c is some positive constant) if V is
real analytic. So, if V is suﬃciently smooth, it is expected that we can control the sum
of ˜Kn,t, and obtain the dispersive type estimate for the whole operator e−itH (i.e. (8)
without the projection Pn). We hope to argue this matter elsewhere in the near future.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the Floquet–Bloch theory
for our operator H and give the explicit form of the integral kernel of e−itH . In Section
3, we give more concrete analysis for the band functions, especially give some estimates
for the derivatives. In Section 4, we prove Theorem 1, and give some comment for the
summability with respect to n of the estimates (8).

2 Floquet–Bloch theory

In this section, we shall calculate the integral kernel of the operator e−itH by using
the Floquet-Bloch theory. Most results in this section are already written in another
literature (e.g. Reed-Simon [14, XIII.16] and Albeverio et. al. [2, III.2.3]), but we shall
give it here again for the completeness.

3 Proposition 10 implies gn → 2|V | as n → ∞.
4 We take |Jn| = O(n−1/3) in the proof of Theorem 1.

First we shall calculate the generalized eigenfunctions for our model, i.e., the solutions

to the equations

−ϕ′′(x) = λϕ(x)
(x ∈ R \ Z),
ϕ(j+) = ϕ(j−)
(j ∈ Z),
ϕ′(j+) − ϕ′(j−) = V ϕ(j)

ϕ(j) = ϕ(j±) in (13).

(13)

Proposition 2. Let λ ∈ C, V ∈ R, and take k ∈ C so that λ = k2. Then, the

equations (11)-(13) have a solution ϕ(x) of the following form.

ϕ(x) = Aj cos k(x − j) + Bjk−1 sin k(x − j)

(j < x < j + 1),

(14)

where Aj and Bj are constants. When k = 0, we interpret k−1 sin k(x − j) = x − j. The
coeﬃcients Aj and Bj satisfy the following recurrence relation.

Bj(cid:19) = T (k)(cid:18)Aj−1

The matrix T (k) satisﬁes det T (k) = 1 and the discriminant D(k) = tr T (k) is

(16)
The proof is a simple calculation, so we shall omit it. Notice that D(k) = D(√λ) is an
entire function with respect to λ, since D(k) is an even function.

D(k) = 2 cos k + V k−1 sin k.

Next we shall calculate the Bloch waves, the solution to (11)-(13) with the quasi-

periodic condition

for some θ ∈ R.

Proposition 3.

ϕ(x + 1) = eiθϕ(x)

(x ∈ R \ Z)

(i) For θ ∈ R, there exists a non-trivial solution ϕ to (11)-(13)

D(k) = 2 cos θ.

(18)

(ii) When (18) holds, a solution ϕ(x) to (11)-(13) and (17) is given by (14) with the

coeﬃcients

B0(cid:19) =(cid:18)−k−1 sin k
(cid:18)A0

cos k − eiθ(cid:19) , (cid:18)Aj

Bj(cid:19) = eijθ(cid:18)A0

B0(cid:19) (j ∈ Z).

(19)

Proof. (i) It is easy to see a non-trivial solution to (11)-(13) and (17) exists if and
only if T (k) has an eigenvalue eiθ, and the latter condition is equivalent to (18), since
det T (k) = 1 and tr T (k) = D(k). (ii) When (18) holds, the vector t(A0 B0) given in
(19) is an eigenvector of T (k) with the eigenvalue eiθ. Thus the second equation in (19)
follows from (15).

Proposition 3 and the Bloch theorem imply λ ∈ σ(H) if and only if (18) holds for
(20)

some θ ∈ R, that is,

− 2 ≤ D(√λ) ≤ 2,

as already stated in (4). For λ < 0, we have

D(√λ) = 2 cosh√−λ + V (√−λ)−1 sinh √−λ.

(21)

If V > 0, the right hand side of (21) is larger than 2 and (20) does not hold for λ < 0.
Thus, there is no negative part in σ(H). If V < 0, then some negative value λ belongs to
σ(H), and the corresponding k is pure imaginary. However, we concentrate on the high
energy limit in the present paper, and the existence of the negative spectrum does not
aﬀect our argument. So we sometimes assume V > 0 in the sequel, in order to simplify
the notation. In this case, the results for V < 0 will be stated in the remark.

By an elementary inspection of the graph of y = D(k), we ﬁnd the following proper-

ties.

Proposition 4. Assume V > 0. Then,
(i) D(0) = 2 + V and D(nπ) = 2 · (−1)n for n = 1, 2, . . ..
(ii) The equation D(k) = 2 · (−1)n has a unique solution k = kn in the open interval

(nπ, (n + 1)π) for n = 0, 1, 2, . . ..

(iii) The equation D′(k) = 0 has a unique solution k = ln in the open interval (nπ, (n +

1)π) for n = 1, 2, . . ., and nπ < ln < kn.

(iv) For convenience, we put l0 = 0. Then, D(k) is monotone decreasing on [ln, ln+1]

for even n, and monotone increasing on [ln, ln+1] for odd n.

Remark. When V < 0, we denote the solution to D(k) = 2· (−1)n in ((n− 1)π, nπ)
When V > 0, the spectrum of H is given as

by kn, and the solution to D′(k) = 0 in ((n − 1)π, nπ) by ln, for n = 2, 3, . . ..

σ(H) = [n=1

In = [k2

by (20) and Proposition 4. The closed interval In is called the n-th band. By the
expression (22), the band gap ((nπ)2, k2
n) is non-empty for every n = 1, 2, . . .. Proposition
4 also implies the function y = D(k) (ln−1 ≤ k ≤ ln) has the unique inverse function
k = D−1(y). Then the band function λn(θ) is deﬁned by

λn(θ) = (k(θ))2,

k(θ) = D−1(2 cos θ)

(kn−1 ≤ k(θ) ≤ nπ).

Remark. When V < 0, the same result holds for n = 2, 3, . . ., but the range of the

function k = k(θ) is [(n − 1)π, kn].
Wronskian of two functions ϕ and ψ is deﬁned as

Before the proof, we prepare a lemma about the Wronskian of the Bloch waves. The

W (ϕ, ψ) = ϕψ′ − ϕ′ψ.

Lemma 6.

(i) For any two solutions ϕ and ψ to (11)-(13), the Wronskian W (ϕ, ψ)

is a constant function on R \ Z.

(ii) Let k = k(θ) and ϕn,θ given in Proposition 5. Let un,θ be the normalized Bloch

wave function deﬁned by

Proof. (i) It is well-known that W (ϕ, ψ) is constant on (j, j + 1) for every j ∈ Z, since
ϕ and ψ are solutions to (11). Moreover, (12) and (13) imply

ϕ′(j+) ψ′(j+)(cid:19)
W (ϕ, ψ)(j+) = det(cid:18) ϕ(j+) ψ(j+)

ϕ′(j−) ψ′(j−)(cid:19) = W (ϕ, ψ)(j−)

for every j ∈ Z. Thus W (ϕ, ψ) is constant on R \ Z.
We introduce an auxiliary function vn,θ(x) by un,θ(x) = eixθvn,θ(x). Then we have

(vn,θ, vn,θ) = 1,

By diﬀerentiating both sides of (33) with respect to θ, we have

(∂θvn,θ, vn,θ) + (vn,θ, ∂θvn,θ) = 0,

(35)

where ∂θ = ∂/∂θ. By diﬀerentiating both sides of (34) with respect to θ, we have

(∂θvn,θ, D(θ)2vn,θ) + 2(vn,θ, D(θ)vn,θ) + (vn,θ, D(θ)2∂θvn,θ) = 2k∂θk.

(36)

By diﬀerentiating (30)-(32) with respect to θ, we see that the derivative ∂θvn,θ also
satisﬁes the same relations (30)-(32). Then we have by integration by parts

(vn,θ, D(θ)2∂θvn,θ) = (D(θ)2vn,θ, ∂θvn,θ).

(37)

By (29), (35) and (37), the ﬁrst term and the third in the left hand side of (36) cancel
with each other. Thus we have

Since the whole operator H has the direct integral decomposition H =R ⊕
Let x, y ∈ (0, 1) and j, m ∈ Z. Since λn(θ) = k(θ)2, un,θ(x + j) = eijθun,θ(x), and

3 Analysis of band functions

In this section, we analyze the band function λn(θ), which is explicitly given by

λn(θ) = (k(θ))2,

k(θ) = D−1(2 cos θ),

(47)

especially its asymptotics as n → ∞. Here k = D−1(y) is the inverse function of

y = D(k) = 2 cos k + V

sin k

k

: [ln−1, ln] → [yn−1, yn],

ln is given in Proposition 4 and its remark, and we put yn = D(ln). By the formula (47),
we can draw the graphs of λn(θ), 5 which are illustrated in Figure 1 in the introduction.
From Figure 1, we notice that λ = λn(θ) is similar to the parabola λ = θ2 on the interval
[(n − 1)π, nπ], except near the edge points. From this reason, we mainly consider the
function λn(θ) on the interval [(n−1)π, nπ], thereby we can simplify some formulas given
below. Figure 1 also suggests us it is better to analyze λn(θ) when its value is near the
band edge, and near the band center, separately.

5 The inverse correspondence θ = arccos(D(k)/2) is useful for the numerical calculation.

3.1 Explicit formulas for derivatives

Our goal is to give an asymptotic bound for the oscillatory integral (24), by using Lemma
15 in Section 4. Then we need lower bounds for the derivatives of λn(θ) up to the third
order, which are calculated explicitly as follows.

k′(θ) = −D′(k)−1 · 2 sin θ,
k′′(θ) = (D−1)′′(2 cos θ) · (2 sin θ)2 − (D−1)′(2 cos θ) · 2 cos θ

= −D′(k)−3D′′(k)(4 − D(k)2) − D′(k)−1D(k),

(2 cos θ) · 2 sin θ · 2 cos θ

where we used the formulas

2 cos θ = D(k), (2 sin θ)2 = 4 − D(k)2,
(D−1)′(D(k)) = D′(k)−1, (D−1)′′(D(k)) = −D′(k)−3D′′(k),
(D−1)(3)(D(k)) = 3D′(k)−5D′′(k)2 − D′(k)−4D(3)(k).

The derivatives of D(k) are given as follows.

D(k) = 2 cos k + V k−1 sin k,
D′(k) = −2 sin k + V (k−1 cos k − k−2 sin k),
D′′(k) = −2 cos k + V (−k−1 sin k − 2k−2 cos k + 2k−3 sin k),
D(3)(k) = 2 sin k + V (−k−1 cos k + 3k−2 sin k + 6k−3 cos k − 6k−4 sin k),
D(4)(k) = 2 cos k + V (k−1 sin k + 4k−2 cos k − 12k−3 sin k − 24k−4 cos k

D(5)(k) = −2 sin k + V (k−1 cos k − 5k−2 sin k − 20k−3 cos k + 60k−4 sin k

D(6)(k) = −2 cos k + V (−k−1 sin k − 6k−2 cos k + 30k−3 sin k + 120k−4 cos k

By the formulas (48)-(53), we can write λ(j)

n (θ) (j = 1, 2, 3) as functions of k, which is
useful for numerical calculation. The graphs of λ′
n(θ) on the interval (n−1)π ≤
θ ≤ nπ (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are illustrated in Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively. From
Figure 5, we see that the solution θ0 to λ′′
n(θ) = 0 exists nearby θ = nπ. Later we give
the asymptotics of θ0 as n → ∞ in Proposition 11.

Though the formulas (48)-(53) are explicit, it is still not easy to obtain the precise
lower bound for the derivatives of λn(θ), especially when λn(θ) is near the band edge.
For this reason, we employ the Puiseux expansion of the inverse function D−1(y), which
makes our analysis clear. This kind of expansion is studied in the classical work by Kohn
[7].

3.2 Asymptotics of kn and ln

First let us analyze the asymptotics of kn and ln given in Proposition 4. A related result
is written in Albeverio et. al. [2, Theorem 2.3.3].

Proposition 7. Let kn and ln as in Proposition 4 and its remark. Then,

kn = nπ + V (nπ)−1 −(cid:18)V 2 +

(n → ∞).

(63)

(64)

Proof. We assume V > 0 for simplicity (in the case V < 0, we only need to change the
sign of h given below). First we prove (63). The number kn is the solution to

D(k) = 2 cos k + V

sin k

k

= 2(−1)n

(nπ < k < (n + 1)π).

(65)

Put k = nπ + h. Then (65) is equivalent to

h = f (h),

f (h) = arcsin(cid:18)1 + cos h

2

V

nπ + h(cid:19) .

(66)

Then, for suﬃciently large n, it is easy to see that the solution to (66) is the limit of the
sequence {hj}j=0 given by6

h0 = 0,

hj = f (hj−1)

(j = 1, 2, . . .).

(67)

6For the rigorous proof, we apply the contraction mapping theorem in the following form:

‘Let
I = [a, b], 0 ∈ I, f ∈ C1(I) and assume f (I) ⊂ I and kf ′kL∞(I) < 1. Then f has the unique ﬁxed point
in I which is the limit of the sequence (67)’. If we take f as in (66) and I = [0, 2V /(nπ)], we can apply
the contraction mapping theorem for suﬃciently large n.

(68)

Then twice substitution of (68) into (67) gives the formula (63) (three times substitution
gives the same formula).

Next we prove (64). Put k = nπ + h. Then the deﬁning equation of ln

D′(k) = −2 sin k + V (k−1 cos k − k−2 sin k) = 0

is equivalent to

h = g(h),

g(h) = arctan(cid:18) V k

2k2 + V (cid:19) ,

k = nπ + h.

Then we can obtain the formula (64) by using the following expansion recursively.

3.3 Analysis on λn(θ) near the band edge
In order to calculate the Puiseux expansion of k = D−1(y), ﬁrst we calculate the Taylor
expansion of y = D(k).

by substituting the following formulas into (56)-(62). From (64), we have

Next we shall calculate the Puiseux expansion of D−1(y) near y = yn. Since k = kn
is the zero of order 2 of D(k), D−1(y) is a double-valued function with respect to the
complex variable y.

Proposition 9. The Puiseux expansion of k = D−1(y) near y = yn is written as

Since the expansions of cm = (−1)n+1dm are obtained from (71)-(75), we can calculate
the coeﬃcients (77)-(81) by solving the above equations.

Remark. 1. The branch points of k = D−1(y) are y = yn, and yn is nearby 2· (−1)n
by (70). Thus the radius of convergence of the Puiseux expansion (76) is about 4, for
suﬃciently large n. This fact justiﬁes the calculus in the sequel.

2. In the case V = 0, the expansion (76) coincides with the Puiseux expansion

(near y = ±2),

Substituting y = 2 cos θ into (76), we obtain the function k = k(θ) = D−1(2 cos θ).

Since the Puiseux expansion (76) has two branches, we obtain two functions

k±(θ) = ln ± e1h1/2 + e2h ± e3h3/2 + e4h2 ± e5h5/2 + · · · ,
h = (−1)n(yn − 2 cos θ).

Notice that h is positive for real θ, so hp/2 in (83) is uniquely deﬁned as a positive

Proof. The proof can be done simply by substituting the expansion (83), (64) and (77)-
(81) into λ± = k2
± and taking the derivative with respect to θ (or τ ) repeatedly. The
formulas (86)-(90) help the calculation.

By construction, we have

λ+(θ) = λn+1(θ),

λ−(θ) = λn(θ),

θ = nπ + τ

(98)

for small τ . Using (98) and the expansion (92), we can ﬁnd the asymptotics of the
solution to λ′′

n(θ) = 0.

Proposition 11. The equation

d2λn
dθ2 = 0,

(n − 1)π ≤ θ ≤ nπ

has a unique solution θ = θ0 for suﬃciently large n. The asymptotics of θ0 is given as

θ0 = nπ −(cid:18) V 2

4nπ(cid:19)1/3

+ O(n−1) as n → ∞.

(99)

Before the proof, we give a numerical result by using the explicit formulas (48)-(53),

in Figure 6. The result shows the formula (99) gives a good approximation.

Figure 6: The graph of λ′′

n , δn = V 2/(4nπ). Here we take V = 1,

Proof. Put δn = V 2/(4nπ). We divide the interval [(n − 1)π, nπ] into three intervals

I1 = [(n − 1)π, (n − 1)π + δ1/4
n ],
I3 = [nπ − δ1/4

n , nπ].

I2 = [(n − 1)π + δ1/4

n , nπ − δ1/4

For θ ∈ I1, we apply the ﬁrst equality of (98) with n replaced by n − 1, so λn = λ+ and
θ = (n − 1)π + τ . Then the expansion (92) for d2λ+/dθ2 implies λ′′
n(θ) > 0 for θ ∈ I1,

for suﬃciently large n. Moreover, the formula (107) given later in Proposition 13 shows

n(θ) > 0 for θ ∈ I2, for suﬃciently large n.
For θ ∈ I3, we apply the second equality of (98), so λn = λ− and θ = nπ + τ . Then
−δ1/4
n < τ < 0, and (97) for λ− implies λ(3)
n (θ) < 0 for θ ∈ I3 \{nπ}, for suﬃciently large
n(θ) is monotone decreasing on this interval, and (92) for d2λ−/dθ2 implies
n. Thus λ′′
n(nπ − δ1/4
λ′′
n(nπ) < 0 for suﬃciently large n.7 Thus there exists a unique
n ) > 0 and λ′′
θ0 ∈ [(n − 1)π, nπ] with λ′′
n(θ0) = 0 for suﬃciently large n, and θ0 ∈ I3.
Let us ﬁnd more detailed asymptotics of θ0. By (92) for d2λ−/dθ2,

d2λn
dθ2 = 0 ⇔ −λ2,−3h−3/2 − λ2,−1h−1/2 + λ2,0 − λ2,1h1/2 + O(h) = 0
f (h) =(cid:18)λ2,−3 + λ2,−1h + λ2,1h2 + O(h5/2)

⇔ h = f (h),

λ2,0

(cid:19)2/3

. (100)

If θ ∈ I3, then τ = O(n−1/4) and h = O(n−1/2) by (87). So, if h is the solution to (100),
the expansions of the coeﬃcients (93)-(96) imply h = O(n−2/3), and again by (100)

h = f (h) = (cid:0)δn + O(n−5/3)(cid:1)2/3
n (cid:0)1 + O(n−2/3)(cid:1) .

= δ2/3

Thus (101) and (87) imply

τ = −δ1/3
Since θ = nπ + τ , we have the conclusion.

n + O(n−1).

(101)

3.4 Analysis on λn(θ) near the band center
Let us prove λn(θ) is similar to the parabola λ = θ2 near the band center, that is, for θ
in the interval

"(n − 1)π +(cid:18) V 2

4nπ(cid:19)1/4

4nπ(cid:19)1/4# .

(102)

Notice that the asymptotics (99) implies θ0 is not in the interval (102) for large n.

Lemma 12. Let k(θ) = D−1(2 cos θ) given in (47), and θ in the interval (102).

Then, we have the following expansion.

k = θ − V D′(θ)−1 sin θ

7When V > 0, the latter fact can also be proved by the explicit value λ′′

n(nπ) = −4(nπ)2/V ; see

((138) below).

Proof. The Taylor expansion of k = D−1(y) around y = D(θ) is

(D−1)′′(D(θ))

k = D−1(D(θ)) + (D−1)′(D(θ)) · (y − D(θ))

Substituting the equality

into (104) and (105), we obtain the conclusion since

(105)

D−1(D(θ)) = θ,

(D−1)′(D(θ)) = D′(θ)−1,
(D−1)′′(D(θ)) = −D′(θ)−3D′′(θ),

where we used (55).

Proposition 13. Let n be a suﬃciently large integer. Then, for θ in the interval

(102), we have the expansion of k = D−1(2 cos θ) given in (47) as follows.

When θ is in the interval (102), we have

θ−1 = O(n−1),

(sin θ)−1 = O(n1/4),

cot θ = O(n1/4).

(109)

Thus the ﬁrst three terms in (108) coincide the formula (106). Let us show that the
remainder term R3 is negligible. By the diﬀerentiation of the inverse function, we can
prove that

(D−1)()(y) = D′(k)−(2j−1) · (Polynomial of D′(k), . . . , D(j)(k)).

(111)

The polynomial part is bounded uniformly with respect to n. By the expansion (76) and
the monotonicity of k = k(θ), we see that k = k(θ) satisﬁes

and

(n − 1)π +(cid:18) V 2

4nπ(cid:19)1/4
4nπ(cid:19)1/4
D′(k)−1 = (−2 sin k + O(n−1))−1 = O(n1/4).

(113)
Put kz = D−1(D(θ) − zV sin θ/θ) (0 ≤ z ≤ 1), then kz lies between k = D−1(2 cos θ) and
θ = D−1(D(θ)), and by (111)-(113)

+ O(n−3/4),

(112)

(D−1)(3)(cid:18)D(θ) − zV

sin θ

θ (cid:19)

= D′(kz)−5 · (Polynomial of D′(kz), D′′(kz), D(3)(kz))
= O(n5/4).

Thus, we once have a rough estimate

|R3| = O(n−3) · O(n5/4) = O(n−7/4),

so the equation (106) holds with the worse remainder term O(n−7/4). However, this
conclusion implies

|k(θ) − θ| = O(n−1),

(114)

22

which also implies

(sin θ)3 · (D−1)(3)(cid:18)D(θ) − zV
D′(kz)(cid:19)3

= (cid:18) sin θ

= O(n1/2),

sin θ

θ (cid:19)

· D′(kz)−2 · (Polynomial of D′(kz), D′′(kz), D(3)(kz))

Thus we have |R3| = O(n−5/2) and (106) holds.
Other estimates can be obtained by diﬀerentiating the formula (103). Then we ﬁnd
the estimate for the remainder term becomes worse by the power n1/4 per one diﬀer-
entiation. For example, the leading term in the remainder in (110) is up to constant
multiple

θ−2 cot2 θ = O(n−3/2).

Diﬀerentiating this term, we get

−2θ−3 cot2 θ + θ−2 · 2 cot θ ·(cid:18)−

1

sin2 θ(cid:19) = O(n−5/4),

and the result is worse than O(n−3/2) by n1/4. As for R3,

(115)

For the ﬁrst term of (115), one sin θ in the numerator changed into cos θ by diﬀerentiation,
and the estimate becomes worse by n1/4, because of (109). For the second term, that
‘(D−1)(3) turned into (D−1)(4)’ makes two D′(kz) in the denominator (see (111)), one of
which cancels with D′(θ) appeared next. Thus the estimate also becomes worse by n1/4,
in total. We can treat the other remainder terms similarly.

Proposition 14. Let an(θ, x, y) given in (116).
(i) The function an is bounded uniformly with respect to θ ∈ R, x, y ∈ (0, 1) and

n = 1, 2, . . ..

(ii) Put δ1 = |V |/(nπ), δ2 = (V 2/(4nπ))1/4, and

I1 = [(n − 1)π, (n − 1)π + δ1],
I3 = [(n − 1)π + δ2, nπ − δ2],

I2 = [(n − 1)π + δ1, (n − 1)π + δ2],
I4 = [nπ − δ2, nπ − δ1],

I5 = [nπ − δ1, nπ].

For suﬃciently large n, the derivative a′

where C is a positive constant independent of θ, x, y, and n. Especially,

is bounded uniformly with respect to n, x, y.

Proof. (i) First we prove dk/dθ = −2 sin θ/D′(k) is bounded uniformly with respect to
n and θ ∈ [(n − 1)π, nπ)]. For θ ∈ I4 ∪ I5, we have τ = θ − nπ = O(n−1/4), and
h = (−1)n(yn − 2 cos θ) = O(n−1/2) by (87). Then we have by the expansions (69) and
(83)

k − ln = k− − ln = −e1h1/2(1 + O(n−1/2)) = −h1/2(1 + O(n−1/2)),
D′(k) = 2d2(k − ln)(1 + O(n−1/2)) = (−1)nh1/2(1 + O(n−1/2)).

Let zn = (−1)nyn as in (85). Since zn ≥ 2,

h = zn − 2 cos τ ≥ 2 − 2 cos τ = 4 sin2 τ

.

Thus

2 sin(τ /2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(1 + O(n−1/2)) = |2 cos(τ /2)| (1 + O(n−1/2)),

and the right hand side is uniformly bounded. We can prove dk/dθ is uniformly bounded
for θ ∈ I1 ∪ I2 in a similar way. For θ ∈ I3, the bounds (109) and (114) hold, so (109)
holds even if θ is replaced by k. Then

−2 sin θ

24

= 1 + O(n−3/4).

(120)

Thus dk/dθ is uniformly bounded on all the intervals I1, . . . , I5. Similarly we can prove
−2 sin k/D′(k) and −2 sin2 θ/(sin k·D′(k)) are uniformly bounded. The remaining factors
are clearly bounded, so we have the conclusion.

(ii) It is suﬃcient to show the three functions

f1(θ) =

dθ(cid:18)−2 sin k
D′(k) (cid:19) ,

f2(θ) =

f3(θ) =

d

dθ(cid:18) −2 sin2 θ
sin k · D′(k)(cid:19)

obey the bound (117), since the derivatives of the remaining factors are bounded.

First, by (57), (58) and (25)

f1(θ) = −2 cos kD′(k) + 2 sin kD′′(k)

For θ ∈ I4 ∪ I5, the expansion (118) implies

−2 sin θ
D′(k)3 = −2 · sin τ · h−3/2(1 + O(n−1/2)).

(121)

(122)

For θ ∈ I5, by (86)

sin τ = O(n−1),

h = zn − 2 cos τ ≥ zn − 2 =

V 2
4

(nπ)−2 + O(n−4),

h−3/2 = O(n3).

(123)

Thus (121), (122) and (123) imply |f1(θ)| = O(n) for θ ∈ I5. For θ ∈ I4, we have
|τ| = O(n−1/4) and by (119)

sin τ = τ (1 + O(n−1/2)),
h ≥ τ 2(1 + O(n−1/2)),

h−3/2 ≤ τ −3(1 + O(n−1/2))

(124)

for large n. Thus (121), (122) and (124) imply |f1(θ)| ≤ Cn−1τ −2 for θ ∈ I4, for some
positive constant C independent of n. For θ ∈ I3, we have by (120)

2 sin θ
D′(k)

−

= O(1), D′(k)−1 = O(n1/4).

So (121) implies |f1(θ)| = O(n−1/2) for θ ∈ I3. Similarly we can prove |f1(θ)| = O(n−1(θ−
(n − 1)π)−2) for θ ∈ I2 and |f1(θ)| = O(n) for θ ∈ I1, thus f1(θ) obeys the bound (117).

25

Next, we shall estimate f2(θ). By (54), (56)-(58) and (25), we have

f2(θ) = −2 cos θ · D′(k) + 2 sin θ · D′′(k) · (−2 sin θ)/D′(k)

D′(k)2

= −D(k)D′(k)2 − (4 − D(k)2)D′′(k)

This equality and (118), (123), (124) and (109) (with θ replaced by k) gives the same
conclusion for f2(θ) (actually, we obtain a bit faster decay for θ ∈ I2 ∪ I3 ∪ I4).

Finally, by (54), (56)-(58) and (25),
D(k)2 − 4
2 sin k · D′(k)

−2 sin2 θ
sin k · D′(k)
f3(θ) = −2 sin θ

,

This estimate is the same as (121). So the same conclusion holds for f3(θ).

4 Proof of Theorem 1

The L1 − L∞ norm of the operator Pne−itH is just the supremum with respect to x, y ∈
R\ Z of the absolute value of the integral kernel Kn,t(x, y) given in (24). Put x = [x]+x′,
y = [y] + y′, [x], [y] ∈ Z, x′, y′ ∈ (0, 1), and s = ([x] − [y])/t, then (24) is rewritten as8

where an is the amplitude function given in (116). The following lemma, taken from
Stein’s book [15, page 334], gives the decay order of the oscillatory integral with respect

Lemma 15. Let I = (a, b) be a ﬁnite open interval and k = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Let φ ∈

C k(I; R), and assume

mk = inf

x∈I |φ(k)(x)| > 0.

If k = 1, we additionally assume φ′ is a monotone function on I. Let ψ ∈ C 1(I; C) and
assume ψ′ ∈ L1(I). Then we have

of the wave front in a periodic media is studied.

Remark. Here, we say f (x) is monotone if f (x) ≤ f (y) (x < y) or f (x) ≥ f (y)
(x < y). The assumption ‘I is ﬁnite’ can be removed if the integral in the left hand side
converges. The proof is done by integration by parts and a mathematical induction (see
Stein [15, page 332-334]).

Proof of Theorem 1. The statement for |t| ≤ 1 immediately follows from Proposition
14. By taking the complex conjugate if necessary, we can assume t > 1 without loss of
generality.

Let θ0 as in Proposition 11. Let vmax = |λ′
n(θ0)| be the maximum of the function
|λ′
n(θ)|. Put θ0 = nπ+τ0 and h0 = (−1)n(yn−2 cos θ0) = zn−2 sin τ0. Put δn = V 2/(4nπ).
Then we have by (99) and (87),

for suﬃciently large n, where C is a constant independent of n. Thus Lemma 15 implies

|K1| + |K3| ≤ Ct−1/3n−1/9,

and the conclusion holds.

10 We can make sure the accuracy of the formulas (133) and (134) in Figure 6.

We conclude the paper by arguing the summability of the bandwise estimates. If we
ﬁx x, y and take the limit n → ∞, then |s| ≤ vmax for suﬃciently large n, by (129)
(see also Figure 4). So there always exists the stationary phase point θs (the solution to
λ′
n(θ) = s) nearby θ = nπ, for suﬃciently large n. For simplicity, assume V > 0 in the
sequel. When θ = nπ, we have by the formulas (48)-(53), (55), (57) and (58)

k′(nπ) = k(3)(nπ) = 0,

k(nπ) = nπ,
k′′(nπ) = D′(nπ)−1(−2 cos nπ) = nπ(V cos nπ)−1 · (−2 cos nπ) = −

we already know the sum P∞

Thus, even if we cut out a small interval Jn around θ = nπ, the bound for the integral over
Jn is not better than O(n−1t−1/2), which is not summable with respect to n. However,
n=1 Pne−itH converges in the strong operator topology in
L2(R). Thus it seems that the sum of the integral kernels converges only conditionally.
We have to analyze the cancellation between the integral kernels for two adjacent bands
more carefully, in order to obtain a better estimate. We hope to argue this subject in
the future.
