Abstract: Motivated by the work of Busse et al. [6] on turbulent convection in
a rotating layer, we exploit the long-run behavior for stochastic Lotka-Volterra
(LV) systems both in pull-back trajectory and in stationary measure. It is proved
stochastic decomposition formula describing the relation between solutions of
stochastic and deterministic LV systems and stochastic Logistic equation. By
virtue of this formula, it is veriﬁed that every pull-back omega limit set is an
omega limit set for deterministic LV systems multiplied by the random equi-
librium of the stochastic Logistic equation. This formula is used to derive the
existence of a stationary measure, its support and ergodicity. We prove the tight-
ness for the set of stationary measures and the invariance for their weak limits as
the noise intensity vanishes, whose supports are contained in the Birkhoﬀ center.

The developed theory is successfully utilized to completely classify three di-
mensional competitive stochastic LV systems into 37 classes. Time average prob-
ability measures weakly converge to an ergodic stationary measure on the at-
tracting domain of an omega limit set in all classes except class 27 c). Among
them there are two classes possessing a continuum of random closed orbits and
ergodic stationary measures supported in cone surfaces, which weakly converge
to the Haar measures of periodic orbits as the noise intensity vanishes. In the
exceptional class, almost every pull-back trajectory cyclically oscillates around
the boundary of the stochastic carrying simplex characterized by three unsta-
ble stationary solutions. The limit for the time average probability measures is
neither unique nor ergodic. These are subject to turbulent characteristics.

1. Introduction

Turbulent convection in a ﬂuid layer heated from below and rotating about a
vertical axis was studied by Busse et al. [5, 6, 16]. They proved that turbulence
occurs when both the Rayleigh number and the Taylor number exceed their
critical values. This kind of turbulence is understood in terms of a manifold of
stationary solutions, each of which is unstable relative to some other solution in
the manifold so that the system evolves in time by realizing cyclically the diﬀer-
ent solutions of the manifold. This cyclically ﬂuctuating solution was achieved by
May and Leonard [29] in the context of population biology, which was conﬁrmed
by experiment in [6,16].
Using the depth d of the layer, the temperature diﬀerence between the upper
and lower boundaries divided by the Rayleigh number (T2−T1)
, and the thermal
diﬀusion time d2
κ as scales for length, temperature and time, respectively, the
convection model described as above is formulated by the Navier-Stokes equa-
tions for the velocity vector v and the heat equation for the deviation θ of the
temperature from the static state:

Here γ, g, κ and ν are the thermal expansion coeﬃcient, the gravitational accel-
eration constant, the thermal diﬀusivity and the kinematic viscosity, respectively.
Ω is the angular velocity rotating about the vertical axis through the center of
the layer. A stress-free condition is applied at the boundaries.

The vertical component of the velocity ﬁeld in the limit of small amplitudes

can be approximately expressed by

vz = f (z, αc)

n(cid:88)

j=−n

cj(t)exp(ikj · r),

(2)

2 and 1

where z (normalized between − 1
2 ) is the vertical component of the posi-
tion vector r, αc is the critical wave number predicted by linear analysis, cj(t) is
the time-dependent amplitude and kj is the horizontal wave vector. The equa-
tion for f (z, αc) together with the boundary conditions at z = ± 1
2 represents an
eigenvalue problem for R(αc). At a ﬁnite value αc this function reaches its min-
imum Rc at which the onset of convection occurs. The horizontal wave vectors
are subject to the conditions |kj| = αc and k−j = −kj. The time-dependent am-
plitudes cj(t) are subject to the conditions cj(t) = −c∗
j (t) denotes
the complex conjugate of cj(t) (see [5,16] for more details). Then it follows from
[5] that ci satisﬁes the equations

j (t), where c∗

where the matrix elements Tij obey the symmetry relationships

Tij = Ti−j = T−ij.

(4)

When the Rayleigh number R exceeds the critical value Rc depending on the
Taylor number T , the static state becomes unstable and convective motions set
in. Restricting the analysis to the case n = 3, setting yi = |ci|2 for i = 1, 2, 3
and making suitable renormalization, Busse et al. [5,6,16] transformed (3) into
the standard symmetric May-Leonard system [29]:

= y1(1 − y1 − αy2 − βy3),
= y2(1 − βy1 − y2 − αy3), 0 < α < 1 < β,
= y3(1 − αy1 − βy2 − y3),

(5)

where yi ≥ 0, i = 1, 2, 3. If the Taylor number T exceeds the critical value Tc,
then α + β > 2 and α < 1. A well-known result of May-Leonard [29] applies
here to arrive at that system (5) exhibits nonperiodic oscillations of bounded
amplitude which have an ever increasing cycle time. Hence, Busse et al. [5,6,
16] concluded that turbulent convection in a rotating layer is approximately de-
scribed by a manifold of three stationary solutions, all of which are unstable with
respect to each other. Such a manifold is spanned by the three axial equilibria
and approached rapidly from arbitrary initial conditions. We interestingly point

4

L. Chen, Z. Dong, J. Jiang, L. Niu, J. Zhai

out that this manifold is just the carrying simplex which would be founded by
Hirsch [17] nearly ten years later.
However, Busse and Heikes [6, p.174] pointed out:“small-amplitude distur-
bances are present at all times and not just at the initial moment, ···. The
existence of a noise level prevents the amplitudes yi from decaying to arbitrary
small levels. At the same time it introduces a random element into the time
dependence of the system; ···.” In the second paragraph of introduction, Heikes
and Busse [16] clearly showed that this randomness occurs for Rayleigh number
R close to the critical value for the onset of convection, Rc. These statements
mean that the deviation of the Rayleigh number and its critical value is an av-
erage size in some sense. Aﬀected by randomness, Heikes and Busse [16, p.31]
expected that the transition from one set of rolls (stationary solutions) to the
next becomes nearly periodic, with a transition time which ﬂuctuates statisti-
cally about a mean value.
ﬂuctuating solution exists when R − Rc is perturbed by a white noise

This stimulates us to exploit that whether stochastic version of cyclically

(R − Rc) + σBt(ω).

Let yi = |ci|2 for i = 1, 2, ..., n and rescale the time by M t. Then the perturbed
equations read

n(cid:88)

(Eσ) : dyi = yi(r +

aijyj)dt + σyidBt, i = 1, 2, ..., n

(6)

j=1

on the positive orthant, where r = (R− Rc)K, aij = −Tij and σ are parameters,
Bt is a Brownian motion. (Eσ) is called Itˆo stochastic diﬀerential equations. Our
main purpose is to investigate an approach to prove the existence of cyclically
ﬂuctuating solutions in path for three dimensional system (6) provided that the
Rayleigh number and the Taylor number exceed their critical values, and that
these cyclically ﬂuctuating solutions concentrate around each axial equilibrium
(it is a saddle), which theoretically shows that turbulence still occurs under
stochastic disturbances. The system (Eσ) is well-known Lotka-Volterra equations
with the growth rate r and a white noise perturbation. Lotka-Volterra equations
have been playing an important role in population dynamics and game dynamics
(see [28,18]).

Following the pioneer work of Khasminskii [26,25] for locally Lipschitz coeﬃ-
cients, the existence and uniqueness of regular stationary measures for stochastic
ordinary diﬀerential equations in Rn have been extensively studied. However,
the feasible domain for (Eσ) is the positive orthant of Rn. Recently, in a general
domain of Rn, Huang, Ji, Liu and Yi [20,21,22, 23, 19] have systematically in-
vestigated stationary measures for stochastic ordinary diﬀerential equations via
Fokker-Plank equations. In [20], they provide several useful measure estimates of
complement of a compact subset of regular stationary measures, such estimates
can be used to obtain tightness of a family of stationary measures. Their key tech-
nique tool is the level set method, in particular, the integral identity they prove.
This tool is used to give several new existence, respectively, non-existence results
for stationary measures by applying Lyapunov-like, respectively, anti-Lyapunov-
like functions in [21,22,23]. Their results only need weaker regularity conditions
and are applicable to both non-degenerate and degenerate equations. All they

consider are regular stationary measures. Bogachev, R¨ockner and Stannat [4]
and Shaposhnikov [33] provided examples to admit multiple or even inﬁnite sta-
tionary measures, and more results stated in the paper of literature reviews [3].
For the attractors for random dynamical systems, one can refer the works of [1,
11,12,10] and the references therein. Huang, Ji, Liu and Yi [19] show that limit-
ing measures as diﬀusion matrices vanish are invariant for the ﬂow generated by
drift vector ﬁeld, and are supported in the global attractor of the ﬂow if the ﬂow
generated by drift vector ﬁeld is dissipative. Due to the limitation on the size of
this article, the list of references contains less than a quarter of the bibliography
we collected.

The purpose of this paper is generally to exploit the long-run behavior for
stochastic Lotka-Volterra systems (Eσ) both in limit of pull-back trajectories and
in stationary measures. Motivated by [9], we will ﬁrst investigate the relation
between solutions of (Eσ) and those of (E0) and stochastic Logistic equation

dg = g(r − rg)dt + σgdBt

(cid:90) t

(8)

and prove the Stochastic Decomposition Formula in the sense that

Φ(t, ω, y) = g(t, ω, g0)Ψ (

g(s, ω, g0)ds,

y
g0

),

where Φ(t, ω, y), Ψ (t, y) are the solutions of (Eσ) and (E0) through the initial
point y, respectively, and g(t, ω, g0) is the solution of (7) through the initial point
g0 > 0.

The stochastic decomposition formula (8) will play an important role to
achieve our goal. By virtue of this formula, it is veriﬁed that every pull-back
omega limit set for (Eσ) is an omega limit set of (E0) multiplied by the random
equilibrium of the scalar stochastic Logistic equation (7). We also investigate
the weak convergence for the transition probability function of solution process
as the time tends to inﬁnity. Using the stochastic decomposition formula (8),
the Khasminskii theorem [26, p.65] and the Portmanteau theorem, it is shown
that a bounded orbit for (E0) deduces the existence of a stationary measure
for (Eσ) supported in a lower dimensional cone consisting of all rays connect-
ing the origin and all points in the omega limit of this orbit. This means that
any stationary measure is not regular and the system possesses a continuum of
stationary measures or multiple isolated stationary measures. Furthermore, we
provide the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for Markov semigroup to have a
unique and ergodic stationary measure on some lower dimensional manifolds. If
(E0) is dissipative, then we prove that the set of stationary measures with small
noise intensity is tight, and that their limiting measures in weak topology are
invariant with respect to the ﬂow of (E0) as the noise intensity σ tends to zero,
whose supports are contained in the Birkhoﬀ center of (E0). This means that on
the global attractor of (E0) any limiting measure takes the complement of the
Birkhoﬀ center measure zero. In section 6, we provide a complete classiﬁcation
for three dimensional competitive (Eσ) with identical intrinsic growth rate both
in pull-back trajectory and in stationary motion. There are exactly 37 scenarios
in terms of competitive coeﬃcients. Among them, each pull-back trajectory in
34 classes is asymptotically stationary, but possibly diﬀerent stationary solution
for diﬀerent trajectory in same class. All stationary measures are given for every
system in these 34 classes, all limiting measures are the convex combination of

6

its Dirac measures at equilibria. Two of the remain classes possess a family of
stochastic closed orbits, and a continuum of ergodic stationary measures sup-
ported in cone surfaces decided by periodic orbits for (E0), respectively, which
weakly converge to the Haar measures of periodic orbits as the noise intensity
tends to zero. All stationary measures are decided by these ergodic stationary
measures via ergodic decomposition theorem. Among all above 36 classes, for any
given solution of (Eσ) through a point y, its time average probability measure for
transition probability function weakly converges to a stationary measure, which
is ergodic in the attracting domain of the omega limit set for y. The ﬁnal class,
the most interesting and complicated one, violates this law. The time average
probability measure for transition probability function of a solution not passing
through the ray connecting the origin and the positive equilibrium of (E0) does
not weakly converge, but has inﬁnite limit measures which are not ergodic and
support in three positive axes. As the noise intensity tends to zero, these sta-
tionary measures weakly converge to a convex combination of Dirac measures
on three unstable axis equilibria. We will reveal that the essential reason for
both peculiar characteristics is that solutions concentrate around three equilib-
ria very long time (approximately inﬁnite) with probability nearly one. Besides,
almost every pull-back trajectory cyclically oscillates around the boundary of
the stochastic carrying simplex which is characterized by three unstable station-
ary solutions. All these are subject to turbulent characteristics. This rigorously
proves that a stochastic version for so called statistical limit cycle exists and that
the turbulence in a ﬂuid layer heated from below and rotating about a vertical
axis is robust under stochastic disturbances.

2. Stochastic Decomposition Formula
A continuous random process B = {Bt,Ft : t ∈ R}, deﬁned on some proba-
bility space (Ω,F, P), is called a two-sided time Brownian motion, if B0 = 0
a.s., for any t (cid:54)= s, Bt − Bs is normally distributed with mean zero and vari-
ance |t − s|, and B has independent increments. In a canonical way, we may
assume Ω = C0(R, R) endowed with the compact-open topology, and F is its
Borel σ−algebra, P is Wiener measure on (Ω,F), and Bt(ω) can be regarded as
coordinate process ω(t). We deﬁne the shift by

θt : Ω → Ω, θtω(s) := ω(s + t) − ω(t), s, t ∈ R.

Then θt is a homeomorphism for each t and (t, ω) → θtω is continuous, hence
measurable. Thus the Brownian motion generates an ergodic metric dynamical
system (Ω,F, P,{θt : t ∈ R}) (see the Appendix A.3 in Arnold [1] for details).

Theorem 1 (Stochastic Decomposition Formula for Itˆo Type). Let Φ(t, ω, y)
and Ψ (t, y) be the solutions of (Eσ) and (E0), respectively. Then

and let ˜Φ(t, ω, y) denote the right hand of (9). Since g(t, ω, g0) is a solution of
(10), it is adapted to the ﬁltration {Ft}. By the deﬁnition of Riemann integral,
the integral for g(t, ω, g0) with variable upper limit is still adapted to the ﬁl-
tration {Ft}. Therefore, G(x, ω, u) is adapted with respect to (ω, u), continuous
with respect to (x, u), continuously diﬀerentiable with respect to u, and linear
with respect to x, which implies that all conditions for the extension of Itˆo’s
Formula hold (see Exercise 3.12 in [31, p.152]).

Applying the extension of Itˆo’s Formula, we obtain that for each i = 1, 2, ..., n,

Theorem 2 (Stochastic Decomposition Formula for Stratonovich Type).
Assume that Φ(t, ω, y) and Ψ (t, y) be the solutions of (11) and (12), respectively,
and g(t, ω, g0) is a positive solution of the Logistic equation of (13). Then

Thus, the conclusion can be obtained in the same manner as that of Theorem 1.

3. The Long-Run Behavior for (11)

The stochastic Logistic equation (13) can be solved, its solutions may be repre-
sented in the form

g(t, ω, x) =

xexp{rt + σBt(ω)}

, x ≥ 0,

whose random equilibrium (or stationary solution) is

that is,

g(t, ω, u(ω)) = u(θtω), for all t ∈ R and all ω ∈ Ω.

Similarly, we can deﬁne a random equilibrium for (11). It is easy to see that
u(θtω) is a unique stationary solution, whose probability density function satis-
ﬁes the Fokker-Plank equation

Corollary 1. Suppose that Φ(t, ω, u(ω)y) and Ψ (t, y) be the solutions of (11)

The pull-back trajectory for (13) ((11)) emanating from x (y) is deﬁned by
g(t, θ−tω, x) (Φ(t, θ−tω, y)), which describes the internal evolution of the envi-
ronment and θ−tω represents the state of the environment at time −t which
transforms into the “real” state (ω) at the time of observation (time 0, after a
time t has elapsed). Chueshov [10, p.202] proved the following.

Lemma 1. Every positive pull-back trajectory for stochastic Logistic equation
(13) is convergent to the random equilibrium u(ω).

Proof. Denote by z(ω) the random variable in R such that z(t, ω) := z(θtω) is
Stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process in R which solves the OU-equation

dz = −µzdt + dBt, µ > 0.

Let us ﬁrst introduce a conjugate transformation:

h(t, ω, x) = g(t, ω, x)exp{−z(θtω)}.

Applying Itˆo formula to the function h(t, ω) = g(t, ω, x)exp{−z(θtω)}, we trans-
form the stochastic equation (13) into

= (1 + µz(θtω))h − h2exp{z(θtω)}.

(24)

Since (24) is Bernoulli’s, it can be transformed into a linear equation with neg-
ative Lyapunov exponent, which implies that (24) has a positive random equi-
librium such that it is exponentially stable.
For any ﬁxed t, x > 0, ω ∈ Ω, h(s, θ−tω, x) is a solution of (24) on 0 ≤ s ≤ t.
Putting h(s, θ−tω, x) into the equation (24), dividing by h(s, θ−tω, x), integrating
from 0 to t, and then dividing by t, we have

Theorems 5, 6 and 7 serve us to provide examples to have a continuum of sta-
tionary motions, which comes from the continuum of equilibria for deterministic
systems.

Example 4.1. Consider three-dimensional competitive LV system:

dy1 = y1(1 − y1 − y2 − y3)dt + σy1 ◦ dBt,
dy2 = y2(1 − y1 − y2 − y3)dt + σy2 ◦ dBt,

The standard simplex ∆ := {(y1, y2, y3) : y1 +y2 +y3 = 1, y1 ≥ 0, y2 ≥ 0, y3 ≥ 0}

The nonzero equilibria set for corresponding system without noise is

}.

Nontrivial stationary motions for (38) are {u(ω)P : P ∈ E} and (30) holds for
y ∈ A(P ), which is a surface.

The stationary measure discussed above all originate from equilibria for sys-
tem (12) via the decomposition formula (14). We will investigate the other types
of stationary measure coming from nontrivial omega limit sets of (12).

Theorem 8 (The Existence of Stationary Solution by Limit Set). Sup-
pose that Ψ (t, y) is a bounded trajectory for (12) with y ∈ Rn
+. Then the system
(11) admits a stationary measure. Furthermore, if the origin O is a repeller and
initial value y (cid:54)= O, then this stationary measure is not the Dirac measure at the
origin.

Proof. Since the trajectory of Ψ (t, y) for (12) is bounded, there exists positive
constant N such that

(cid:107)Ψ (t, y)(cid:107) ≤ N, for all t > 0.

(39)

By the Khasminskii theorem [26, p.65] and Chebyshev inequality, for proving
the existence of stationary measure for system (11), it will suﬃce to prove that
there exists a constant M such that

E(cid:107)Φ(t, ω, y)(cid:107)2 ≤ M, for all t ≥ 0.

This shows that (40) holds. The Khasminskii theorem [26, p.65] asserts that

Remark 4. Suppose that Ψ (t, y) is a nontrivial periodic orbit Γ for (12). Then
Λ(Γ ) is a cone surface with the origin as vertex. It follows from [9, Proposition
4.13] that ωF (x) = Γ for all x ∈ Λ(Γ )\{O}, that is, Γ is a global attractor when
the ﬂow Ψ is restricted to Λ(Γ )\{O}. By the cone invariance, Λ(Γ ) is invariant
for both Φ(t, ω,·) and Φ(t, θ−tω,·). Applying Theorem 4, we know that u(ω)Γ
is a global attractor for pull-back ﬂow Φ(t, θ−tω,·) restricted on Λ(Γ ) \ {O}. In

It is easy to calculate that the system (51) has a unique positive equilibrium
E0 = ( 3

cone surfaces Λ(h):

(2y1 + 3y2 + 2y3)3 ≡ h, 0 < h ≤ 1

on which there is no equilibrium except h = 1
324 . Hence, every trajectory on
Λ(h) will converge to a periodic orbit on it. These periodic orbits must lie on
the center manifold for P0, which is transversal to each Λ(h) and intersects with
Λ(h) on the unique closed orbit Γ (h).

Now we study the noise disturbed system:

dy1 = y1(1 − y1 + 2y2 − 3y3)dt + σy1 ◦ dBt,
dy2 = y2(1 − 3y1 − y2 + y3)dt + σy2 ◦ dBt,
dy3 = y3(1 + y1 − 4y2 − y3)dt + σy3 ◦ dBt.

(52)

Applying Theorems 9, 5, and 4, we conclude that there exists a stationary mea-
h supported on Λ(h)(0 < h ≤ 1

324 ) and every nontrivial pull-back trajec-
tory on Λ(h) tends to u(ω)Γ (h) as t → ∞. The subsequent theorem will show
h converges weakly to the Haar measure on the closed orbit Γ (h) as σ → 0.

5. Limiting Measures for Stationary Measures and Their Supports

In this section, we will exploit the weak convergence for stationary measures
as the noise intensity σ tends to zero. The paper [7] has established the frame

22

L. Chen, Z. Dong, J. Jiang, L. Niu, J. Zhai

to study limiting behavior of stationary measures with small noise intensity.
According to the frame, the study is divided into three steps: the ﬁrst step is
to prove that the solution of (11) converges to the solution of (12) uniformly
starting from the same initial point on any compact set as σ → 0; the second
step is to prove the tightness for the family of stationary measures and then to
show that any limiting measure is an invariant measure for deterministic system
(12); the third step is to deduce that any limiting measure is supported in the
Birkhoﬀ center for (12).

Let us start with the ﬁrst step. Before that, we will present the dissipation

assumption.

+ → R : V (Ψ (t, y)) < V (y) if t > 0, y ∈ Rn

The system (12) is said to be dissipative, if there is a compact invariant
set D, called the fundamental attractor, which uniformly attracts each compact
set of initial values. Wilson [36] proved that D has a C∞ Lyapunov function
+ \ D with V (y) → ∞ as
V : Rn
y → ∞. By the Sard theorem [32], V has a sequence of regular values αn → ∞.
Then V −1(αn) is the boundary of the compact set Mn = V −1(−∞, αn], which is
a neighborhood of D; and the ﬂow enters Mn transversely along ∂Mn = V −1(αn)
for each n ≥ 0.
use the notation M0 = V −1(−∞, α0], where α0 is a regular point for V .
Because we are concerned with the variation for the solution Φ(t, ω, y) as
σ → 0, we let Φσ(t, ω, y) denote the solution of (11) from now on, similarly for
gσ(t, ω, 1).
Proposition 1. Let K ⊂ Rn
Then there is a constant C depending on K and T , such that

Throughout this section, we assume that the system (12) is dissipative and

+ be a compact set and T > 0 an arbitrary number.

E[(cid:107)Φσ(T, ω, y) − Ψ (T, y)(cid:107)] ≤ C|σ|,

which implies that for any δ > 0

(55)

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that K ⊂ M0. Let F (y) denote
the vector ﬁeld for the right hand of (12). Since M0 is compact, there is a constant
C0 such that (cid:107)y(cid:107) + (cid:107)F (y)(cid:107) ≤ C0 for all y ∈ M0.

Utilizing the decomposition formula (14), we get that

Hence, for all y ∈ M0, we have

PT (y,·) :=

P (t, y,·)dt,

(61)

is a stationary measure for (11) (see Theorem 8), where y ∈ Rn
+. Because what
we are interested in is limit behavior for stationary measures as σ → 0, we pay
our attention to small σ. Hence, we restrict 0 < |σ| ≤ σ0 for σ0 suﬃciently
small. Now denote by MS(σ0) all the stationary measures obtained in a manner
just stated. The following proposition answers the tightness of this stationary
measures set.
Proposition 2. MS(σ0) is tight.
Proof. For any N > 0 and νσ

Since M0 is compact and Ψ (t, y) is bounded, there are positive constants C0 and
Cy such that (cid:107)x(cid:107) ≤ C0 for all x ∈ M0 and (cid:107)Ψ (t, y)(cid:107) ≤ Cy for any t ≥ 0. The
dissipation assumption implies that there is a t0 such that Ψ (t, y) ∈ M0 for all
t ≥ t0. By (49), τ (ω, t0) is a stopping time satisfying (50) and τ (ω, t0) < ∞.
Therefore,

By the Poincar´e recurrence theorem (see, e.g., Ma˜n´e [27, Theorem 2.3, p.

29]), we can obtain the following consequence immediately.

Proposition 4. Assume that µ is an invariant probability measure of the ﬂow
Ψ . Let supp(µ) denote the support of µ and B(Ψ ) be the Birkhoﬀ’s center of Ψ .
Then the support of µ is contained in the Birkhoﬀ’s center of Ψ , i.e.,

where B(Ψ ) = {y ∈ Rn

+ : y ∈ ωF (y)}.

supp(µ) ⊂ B(Ψ ),

The main result in this section is summarized as follows.

Theorem 10. Let Ψ be dissipative. Then MS(σ0) is tight. If µi

then µ is an invariant measure of Ψ , whose support is contained in its Birkhoﬀ ’s

6. The Complete Classiﬁcation for 3-Dim Stochastic Competitive LV
System

This section focuses on three dimensional Stratonovich stochastic competitive
LV equations:

dy1 = y1(r − a11y1 − a12y2 − a13y3)dt + σy1 ◦ dBt,
dy2 = y2(r − a21y1 − a22y2 − a23y3)dt + σy2 ◦ dBt,
dy3 = y3(r − a31y1 − a32y2 − a33y3)dt + σy3 ◦ dBt.

(72)

Here r > 0, aij > 0, i, j = 1, 2, 3. We will classify the long-run behavior of
stochastic system (72) both in pull-back trajectory and in stationary measure.
To achieve this goal, we have to introduce the classiﬁcation results for the cor-
responding deterministic three dimensional competitive LV equations:

= y1(r − a11y1 − a12y2 − a13y3),
= y2(r − a21y1 − a22y2 − a23y3),
= y3(r − a31y1 − a32y2 − a33y3),

6.1. Review Classiﬁcation for 3-Dim Deterministic Competitive LV System. Zee-
man [37] classiﬁed the stable nullcline classes for general three dimensional com-
petitive LV equations, which permit diﬀerent intrinsic growth rates. The stable
nullcline class means that their boundary equilibria are hyperbolic and have the
same local dynamics on Σ after a permutation of the indices {1, 2, 3}. She got
that general three dimensional competitive LV equations admit in total 33 sta-
ble nullcline classes. Nevertheless, among the same stable nullcline class, two
systems may have diﬀerent dynamics, global dynamics is unknown for six sta-
ble nullcline classes. However, in the case of the identical intrinsic growth rate,
global dynamics for all stable nullcline classes can be classiﬁed in the competitive
parameters aij, as done in [9].

Theorem 13. ([9, Theorem 4.12]) There are exactly 37 dynamical classes in 33
stable nullcline classes for system (73). Each class is given by inequalities in
competitive coeﬃcients permitting permutation of indices, all trajectories tend
to equilibria for classes 1-25, 26 a), 26 c), 27 a) and 28-33, a center on Σ only
occurs in 26 b) and 27 b), and the heteroclinic cycle attracts all orbits except
L(P ) in class 27 c). All are depicted on Σ and presented in Table 1 in Appendix
A.

Let us explain what the notations on Σ in Table 1 mean and how to get global
dynamical behavior from the pictures in Table 1. By Hirsch’s Theorem 11, the
carrying simplex Σ is homeomorphic to the closed unit simplex S3 by radial
projection. So we regard S3 as Σ and draw pictures on the standard simplex
S3, where three vertexes {R1, R2, R3} represent three axial equilibria for (73).

30

L. Chen, Z. Dong, J. Jiang, L. Niu, J. Zhai

Let us take the class 14 in Appendix A (see Fig.1) as an example to explain the
notations and their meaning. A closed dot • denotes an attracting equilibrium
(see R2, V2) on Σ, an open dot ◦ denotes the repelling one (see R1) on Σ, and
the intersection of stable and unstable manifolds is a saddle on Σ (see R3, V1).
The asymptotic behavior for every trajectory on Σ is clearly seen from Fig. 1.

Fig. 1: The dynamics in Σ.

Let AΣ(Q) denote the attracting domain for an equilibrium Q ∈ E on Σ. It
follows from [9, Proposition 4.13] that any pair of nonzero points on L(y) have
the same omega limit set. We can obtain the attracting domain for Q as follows

(cid:91){L(y) \ {O} : y ∈ AΣ(Q)}.

A(Q) =

(74)
Therefore, the attracting domain for a given Q can be derived by AΣ(Q) drawn
in Table 1 and (74). This has given precise long-term behavior for 34 classes
:1-25, 26 a), 26 c), 27 a) and 28-33 in Table 1.

It remains to describe the rest three classes: class 26 b), class 27 b), and class

27 c). For this aim, deﬁne

The system (73) admits nontrivial periodic orbits if and only if θ = 0 (see [9,
Theorem 4.3]), which only occurs in class 26 b) and class 27 b). Both classes
possess heteroclinic cycle connecting three equilibria, interior of which on Σ a
family of continuum periodic orbits {Γ (h)} : h ∈ I} are full of. Each closed orbit
{Γ (h)} is the intersection of the carrying simplex Σ and invariant cone surface
given by

and αi, βi are given in (75). We depict typical closed orbit and its attracting
cone surface for these two classes in Fig.2 and Fig.3. The readers are referred to
[9, Theorem 4.13] for details.

Now we summarize the long-run behavior for these three classes as follows.

(a) Let the competitive parameters satisfy inequalities in class 26 b) besides θ = 0.
Then the unique positive equilibrium P attracts L(P ) \ {O}; the closed orbit
Γ (h) attracts Λ(h) \ {O}; all other trajectories converge an equilibrium.
(b) Let the competitive parameters satisfy inequalities in class 27 b) besides θ = 0.
Then the unique positive equilibrium P attracts L(P ) \ {O}; the closed orbit
Γ (h) attracts Λ(h) \ {O}.

Remark 6. Among 37 classes, the class 27 c) is the only one for statistical limit
cycle, or turbulence founded in Busse et al. [5, 6, 16], to occur.

6.2. The Complete Classiﬁcation for Long-Run Behavior via Pull-Back Trajec-
tory. Combing Theorems 4, 13 and 14, we can completely classify the long-run
behavior of pull-back trajectories for three dimensional stochastic competitive
LV system (72).

Theorem 15. Among classes 1-25, 26 a), 26 c), 27 a) and 28-33, each pull-back
trajectory Φ(t, θ−tω, y) converges a random equilibrium. More precisely, for a
given equilibrium Q ∈ E, Φ(t, θ−tω, y) → u(ω)Q as t → ∞ for all y ∈ A(Q). The
same result hold for the remain three classes when y is located in an attracting
domain of an equilibrium.

Theorem 16. Assume that θ = 0 and the competitive parameters inequalities in
class 26 b) or class 27 b) hold. Then the pull-back omega-limit set Γy(ω) of the
trajectory Φ(t, θ−tω, y) emanating from y is u(ω)Γ (h) if and only if y ∈ Λ(h).
Theorem 17. Assume that θ > 0 and the competitive parameters inequalities
in class 27 c) hold. Then the pull-back omega-limit set Γy(ω) of the trajectory
Φ(t, θ−tω, y) emanating from y is u(ω)H if and only if y /∈ L(P ), where H is the
heteroclinic orbit for (73).

Remark 7. When a random element is introduced into the time dependence of
the system, every sample path not emanating from L(P ) cyclically ﬂuctuates
in class 27 c). The turbulent ﬂuid state is characterized by three stationary
solutions, all of which are unstable so that the actually realized state wanders
from a neighbourhood of one of the stationary solutions to that of the next.

6.3. The Classiﬁcation via Stationary Measures. First, let us consider the case
for trajectory of (73) to converge to an equilibrium.
Theorem 18. Let Q ∈ E. Then for each y ∈ A(Q), P (t, y,·)→ µσ
t → ∞, and

Q weakly as

(78)

t→∞ P (t, y, A) = µσ
lim

Q(A), for any A ∈ B(R3
+).

Moreover, µσ
Q is the unique stationary measure for the Markov semigroup Pt
in A(Q), and hence, it is ergodic when the system is restricted on A(Q), and
Q(·) w→ δQ(·) as σ → 0. These results are available for classes 1-25, 26 a), 26
µσ
c), 27 a) and 28-33 as well as any equilibrium in classes 26 b), 27 b) and 27 c)
when we restrict the state space in its stable manifold.
Proof. For a given equilibrium Q ∈ E, it follows from the cone invariance that
Φ(t, ω, y) ∈ A(Q) for any y ∈ A(Q). Then the probability distribution function
P (t, y,·) only supports in A(Q) if y ∈ A(Q). Thus, replacing IntRn
+ by A(Q),
we can verify this theorem in the quite same manner as that of Theorem 6. We
omit it.

Theorem 19. Suppose that (73) is one of systems in classes 1-25, 26 a), 26 c),
27 a) and 28-33. Then all its stationary measures are the convex combinations of
ergodic stationary measures {µσ

are the convex combinations of the Dirac measures {δQ(·) : Q ∈ E}.

h converges
weakly to the Haar measure on the closed orbit Γ (h) as σ → 0.
Proof. Fix h ∈ I and y0 ∈ Γ (h), deﬁne ϕ(y) = inf{t > 0, Ψ (t, y0) = y} for any
y ∈ Γ (h), and denote Υ = ϕ(y0) which is the period of the orbit Ψ (t, y0). Let
S := R+ mod Υ denote a circle. Then it is diﬃcult to see that ϕ : Γ (h) → S is
a homeomorphism. By Theorem 11, for any Λ(h) \ {O}, there are unique λ > 0
and z ∈ Γ (h) such that y = λz. Deﬁne ψ : Λ(h) \ {O} → R × S by

where y = λz with λ > 0 and z ∈ Γ (h). It is easy to see that ψ : Λ(h) \ {O} →
R × S is a homeomorphism, its inverse is ψ−1(x, τ ) = exΨ (τ, y0).

For any y = λz ∈ Λ(h) \ {O} with λ > 0 and z ∈ Γ (h), it follows from (8)

that

Obviously, Ψ ((cid:82) t

Denote by H0 and T0 the numbers ln λ and ϕ(z), respectively. Then applying

Decomposition Formula and Stationary Measures for SLVS

The second inequality follows from the fact of Classical Wiener space (see e.g.
[30,34]). This implies that (H, T ) is irreducible on R × S and that Φ is ergodic
on Λ(h)\{O}. Furthermore, combining [13, Theorem 3.2.4(iii)] and the fact that
νσ
h takes zero measure at the origin (see Theorem 8), Φ is also ergodic on Λ(h).
Again using [13, Theorem 3.2.4(iii)], we obtain that νσ

Theorems 18 and 20 have given all ergodic stationary measures for all classes
except class 27c). From ergodic decomposition theorem [35, §1.2], every station-
ary measure is expressed by ergodic stationary measures, which is stated in the
following.

Theorem 21. Assume that θ = 0 and the competitive parameters inequalities
in class 26 b) or class 27 b) hold. Let E 26 = {O, P, V1, V2, R1, R2, R3} and E 27 =
{O, P, R1, R2, R3} denote the equilibria set of the classes 26 and 27, respectively.
Then the ergodic stationary measure set is

Theorem 22. Assume that θ = 0 and the competitive parameters inequalities
in class 26 b) or class 27 b) hold. Let µi := νσi
and µi w→ µ as i → ∞, where νσi
is the unique ergodic nontrivial stationary
measure supporting on the cone Λ(hi). Suppose that each Γ (yi
0) is the closed
orbit generating the cone Λ(hi), i = 1, 2,··· and that yi
0 → y0 as i → ∞. Then
if y0 lies in the interior of the heteroclinic cycle H, then µ is the Haar measure
on Γ (y0) for y0 (cid:54)= P , or the Dirac measure δP (·) at P for y0 = P . If y0 ∈ H,

Proof. Let µi := νσi

that each Γ (yi

that yi
of H on Σ with y0 (cid:54)= P . If there is a subsequence of {yi
0} lying on Γ (y0), then
Theorem 20 implies that µ is the Haar measure on Γ (y0). Otherwise, we suppose
0} are in the interior of Γ (y0) on Σ, then
that all points in {yi

we may assume that yi
0))) = 1 for i = 1, 2,··· . Let Di and
the ﬁrst part result deduces that µi(Λ(Γ (yi
D0 denote the interior of the closed orbits Γ (yi
0) and Γ (y0) on Σ, respectively.
Then µk(Λ(Di)) = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. However, Λ(Di) \ {O} is an open subset in
+. For each i ≥ 1, it follows from the Portmanteau theorem (see [2, Theorem
R3
2.1(iv)]) that

k→∞ µk(Λ(Di) \ {O}) = 0.

Secondly, we assume that y0 = P , yi

(87)
In addition, µ({O}) = 0 by Corollary 3. This proves that µ(Λ(Di)) = 0 for
each i ≥ 1. Using the continuity of probability measure, µ(Λ(D0)) = 0. Again
utilizing the Portmanteau theorem (see [2, Theorem 2.1(iii)]) that µ(Λ(D0)) = 1.
Hence µ(Λ(Γ (y0))) = 1. Since the recurrent points on Λ(D0) is Γ (y0) ∪ {O}, µ
is the Haar measure on Γ (y0). The case that y0 lies outside of Γ (y0) on Σ can
be treated analogously.
0 lies in the
) on Σ for i = 2, 3,··· . Then µk(Λ(Di)) = 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. The
interior of Γ (yi−1
Portmanteau theorem (see [2, Theorem 2.1(iii)]) implies that µ(Λ(Di)) = 1 for
each given i. µ(L(P )) = 1 follows from the continuity of the probability measure
µ.
Thirdly, suppose y0 ∈ H. Then without loss of generality, we may assume that
0 ∈ Di+1 for each i. By a similar way, we can obtain (87) and µ(Λ(Di)) = 0
yi
for i = 1, 2,··· . Let D∗ denote the interior of H on Σ. Then µ(Λ(D∗)) = 0.
Applying [2, Theorem 2.1(iii)], we conclude that µ(Λ(D∗) ∪ Λ(H)) = 1, and
hence that µ(Λ(H)) = 1. It is not diﬃcult to see that the recurrent points on
H are {E1, E2, E3, O}. Consequently, (86) follows from Corollary 3. The proof
is complete.

respect to initial points, the time length from entering B(C) to going out of
B(C) for the trajectory Ψ (t, y) is approximately s. However, since R1, R2 and

Remark 9. According to Busse et al. [5,6,16], 27 c) corresponds to the case for
turbulence to occur in deterministic system. Theorem 17 illustrates that al-
most every pull-back trajectory cyclically oscillates around the boundary of the
stochastic carrying simplex which is characterized by three unstable station-
ary solutions. Theorem 23 only describes the support of stationary measures.
Appendix B will show that stochastic turbulence has nonuniqueness and non-
ergodicity characteristics in the limit of time average of probability measures.
We will reveal that the essential reason for both peculiar characteristics is that
solutions concentrate around R1, R2, R3 very long time (approximately inﬁnite)
with probability nearly one.

7. Conclusions and Discussion

This paper has proved the stochastic decomposition formula: every solution pro-
cess for stochastic Lotka-Volterra systems with identical intrinsic growth rate
is expressed in terms of a solution for the corresponding deterministic Lotka-
Volterra system without noise perturbation multiplied by an appropriate solution
process of the scalar Logistic equation with the same type noise perturbation.
Using this decomposition, we have shown that every pull-back omega limit set
for the considered stochastic Lotka-Volterra systems is an omega limit set of
the corresponding deterministic Lotka-Volterra system multiplied by the ran-
dom equilibrium of the scalar stochastic Logistic equation with the same type
of noise. This illustrates the interesting dynamics in trajectory of deterministic
Lotka-Volterra system is preserved if identical intrinsic growth rate is perturbed
by a white noise. Employing the stochastic decomposition formula, the Khasmin-
skii theorem and the Portmanteau theorem, it is shown that a bounded orbit for
deterministic Lotka-Volterra system deduces the existence of a stationary mea-
sure for stochastic Lotka-Volterra system supported in a lower dimensional cone
which consists of all rays connecting the origin and all points in the omega limit
set of this orbit. In particular, an equilibrium Q for deterministic Lotka-Volterra

42

system produces a stationary measure µσ
Q for stochastic Lotka-Volterra system
supported in a ray connecting the origin and the equilibrium Q, which has a
continuous distribution function and weakly converges to the Dirac measure at
Q as σ vanishes by the Weierstrass theorem. Besides, that a trajectory Ψ (t, y)
converges to Q is equivalent to that the pull-back trajectory through y converges
to the stationary solution corresponding to µσ
Q. This means that the probability
transition function P (t, y, A) converges to µσ
Q(A) for any Borel set A as the time
tends to inﬁnity, which helps us to provide the necessary and suﬃcient condi-
tions for Markov semigroup to have a unique and ergodic stationary measure.
A closed orbit Ψ (t, y) for deterministic Lotka-Volterra system deduces the exis-
tence of stationary measure νσ for stochastic Lotka-Volterra system supported
in a two dimensional cone surface with the origin as the vertex decided by this
closed orbit, which weakly converges to the Haar measure on the closed orbit
as σ vanishes. The solutions for stochastic Lotka-Volterra system are invariant
when restricted on this cone surface. As above, any stationary measure is always
not regular. This paper reveals the close connection between the dynamics of
deterministic Lotka-Volterra system and long-run behavior for stochastic Lotka-
Volterra system. This makes us to be able to construct many examples to possess
a continuum of stationary measures or multiple isolated stationary measures or
even others, which are not obtained by the way of convex combination of them.
Suppose that the deterministic Lotka-Volterra system (E0) is dissipative.
Then we prove that the set of stationary measures with small noise intensity
is tight, and that their limiting measures in weak topology are invariant with
respect to the ﬂow of (E0) as the noise intensity σ tends to zero, whose supports
are contained in the Birkhoﬀ center of (E0). This means that on the global at-
tractor of (E0) any limiting measure takes the complement of the Birkhoﬀ center
measure zero. In the case that (E0) is competitive, the global attractor is the
compact invariant set surrounded by the carrying simplex Σ and the boundary
of Rn
+. However, the Birkhoﬀ center consists of the recurrent points in the carry-
ing simplex and the origin. This means that our result gives much more precise
description for support of limiting measures than that Huang, Ji, Liu and Yi
[19] have given.

Finally, we provide the complete dynamics classiﬁcation for three dimensional
competitive (Eσ) both in pull-back trajectory and in stationary motion. There
are exactly 37 dynamic scenarios in terms of competitive coeﬃcients. Among
them, each pull-back trajectory in 34 classes is asymptotically stationary, but
possibly diﬀerent stationary solution for diﬀerent trajectory in same class. For
any given system in these 34 classes, all its stationary measures are the convex
combinations of {µσ
Q : Q ∈ E}. As σ → 0, all their limiting measures are the
convex combinations of the Dirac measures {δQ(·) : Q ∈ E}. Two of the remain
classes possess a family of stochastic closed orbits, and there exists a continuum
of invariant cone surfaces Λ(h) decided by the origin and the closed orbits for the
corresponding deterministic Lotka-Volterra system. For each Λ(h), the system
admits a unique nontrivial ergodic stationary measures νσ
h supported in it, which
weakly converge to the Haar measures of periodic orbits as the noise intensity
tends to zero. In addition, any limiting measure for a sequence of stationary
measures νσi
+, will
yi
support in the three equilibria on H. In the ﬁnal class, the most interesting and
0
complicated one, almost every pull-back trajectory cyclically oscillates around

the boundary of the stochastic carrying simplex which is characterized by three
unstable stationary solutions u(θtω)Ri, i = 1, 2, 3. The time average probability
measure for transition probability function of a solution not passing through the
ray connecting the origin and the positive equilibrium of (E0) does not weakly
converge, but has inﬁnite limit measures which are not ergodic and support
in three positive axes. As the noise intensity tends to zero, these stationary
measures weakly converge to a convex combination of Dirac measures on three
unstable axis equilibrium. We will reveal in the Appendix B that the essential
reason for these peculiar characteristics is that solutions concentrate around
R1, R2, R3 very long time (approximately inﬁnite) with probability nearly one.
All these are subject to the turbulent characteristics. This rigorously proves
that a stochastic version for so called statistical limit cycle exists and that the
turbulence in a ﬂuid layer heated from below and rotating about a vertical axis
is robust under stochastic disturbances.

Observing Table 1, there are four classes to possess a heteroclinic cycle, which
are 26 b), 27 a), 27 b), and 27 c). In the classes 26 b), 27 b), and 27 c), it holds
, i = 1, 2,··· ,
that any limiting measure for a sequence of stationary measures νσi
yi
satisfying σi → 0 and yi
0
+, will support in the three
equilibria on H. However, in the class 27 a), νσ
P for any y ∈ IntR3
+. What
is the reason for this diﬀerence? The reason is that in the classes 26 b), 27 b),
and 27 c), the heteroclinic cycle H is either neutrally stable, or asymptotically
stable, while in the class 27 a), the heteroclinic cycle H is unstable. Solutions
for stochastic ordinary diﬀerential equations (SODEs) is usually deﬁned in the
nonnegative time, therefore, its probability transition function is deﬁned in the
nonnegative time, which causes νσ
+. If one considers two-
sided Brownian motion, then solutions for SODEs can be deﬁned in the entire
real time (see [1]). This consideration permits Tn → −∞ in (61) and may prove
the existence of stationary measures in generalized meaning supported in the
boundary of the ﬁrst orthant, which weakly converges to an invariant measure
supported in three equilibria on H.

y = µσ

P for any y ∈ IntR3

Before ﬁnishing this paper, we point out that although all results are pre-
sented for Stratonovich stochastic diﬀerential equations (11) they are valid for
Itˆo stochastic diﬀerential equations (6) as long as σ2 < 2r.

8. Appendix A. The Complete Dynamical Classiﬁcation for both
Autonomous and Stochastic Three Dimensional Competitive LV
Systems with Identical Intrinsic Growth Rate on the Carrying
Simplex

Table 1. Description How to Understand the Dynamics on the Carrying Simplex.

Autonomous Case: The total of 37 dynamical classes among the 33 stable
nullcline equivalence classes for (73), where the parameters aij and Σ are given
by a representative system of that class. The notation • and ◦ denote an attractor
and a repeller on Σ, respectively, while a saddle on Σ is the intersection of its
stable and unstable manifolds (We refer to [9]).
Stochastic Perturbation Case: The carrying simplex Σ in autonomous case
is replaced by the ﬁber u(ω)Σ (ω ∈ Ω); an equilibrium Q, a closed orbit Γ and
a heteroclinic cycle H are understood as u(ω)Q, u(ω)Γ and u(ω)H, respectively.
All trajectories are understood pull-back ones.

9. Appendix B. Turbulent Characteristics: Nonuniqueness and
Nonergodicity in Limit for the Time Average Probability Measures

The time average of transition probability function for each solution weakly
converges to an ergodic stationary measure for (72) on the attracting domain of
the omega limit set of the orbit for the (73) through the same initial point in all
classes except class 27 c). But class 27 c) is quite diﬀerent. If y ∈ IntR3
+\L(P ),
the corresponding time average of transition probability function has inﬁnite
weak limit points, which are not ergodic. We will reveal that the essential reason
for both peculiar characteristics is that solutions concentrate around R1, R2, R3
very long time (approximately inﬁnite) with probability nearly one.
Theorem 12 tells us that nontrivial stationary measures are produced by the
solutions through points in Σ. So we ﬁx y ∈ Σ with y (cid:54)= P . In order to prove these
(cid:82) T
by speciﬁc estimations, we will consider the symmetric May-Leonard system (5)
with α = 0.8 and β = 1.3. The other cases are similar.
