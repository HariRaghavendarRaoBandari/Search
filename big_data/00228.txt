In the present work, we estimate the decays of the X(5568) and X(5616) in a B ¯K and a B∗ ¯K S -wave hadronic
molecule scenarios, respectively, which may corresponding to the structure observed by D0 Collaboration. Our
estimation indicates both B ¯K and B∗ ¯K hadronic molecule decay widths could explain the experimental data in
a proper model parameter range.

INTRODUCTION

s and B0

−1.9(syst) MeV and 21.9 ± 6.4(stat)+5.0

Very recently, the D0 Collaboration observed a new nar-
row structure in the B0
sπ± invariant mass spectrum, named
X(5568), the mass and width of the structure are 5567.8 ±
2.9(stat)+0.9
−2.5(syst) MeV, re-
spectively [1]. The observed channel indicates the isospin
of the X(5568) is 1. If the structure decays into B0
sπ± via a
S−wave, the quantum numbers of the X(5568) are JPC = 0++.
As indicated in Ref. [1], the observed structure may decay
through the chain B0∗s π0, B0∗s → B0
sγ, in which the soft photon
may not be detected since the mass gap of B0∗s and B0
s is less
than 50 MeV. In this case, this structure decays into B∗0
s π±,
and the mass of the structure should be shifted by addition of
the mass diﬀerence of B∗0
s, which is about 5616 MeV,
while the width remains unchanged. This structure would be
named X(5616) with the quantum number JPC = 1++ if it cou-
ples to B0∗s π± via the lowest S−wave.
and π± are ¯bs and u ¯d/¯ud,
The quark components of the B(∗)0
respectively, thus X(5568) is a kind of structures with four dif-
ferent ﬂavors of quarks, which is observed for the ﬁrst time.
This peculiar property of the X(5568) indicates that it could
not be a conventional meson formed by a quark and a anti-
quark. For a system composed of two quarks and two an-
tiquarks, the color factorization property of the system indi-
cates a two-mesons deuteron-like hadronic molecule struc-
ture. Some newly observed hadron states have been exten-
sively investigated in hadronic molecule scenario. For ex-
[2–6], the properties of the Y(4260) were
ample, in Refs.
studied, in which the Y(4260) were assigned as a DD1(2420)
molecule. Similarly, the masses and decay behaviors of the
Zc(3900)/Zc(4020) and Zb(10610)/Zb(10650) were estimated
in the D∗ ¯D+h.c/D∗ ¯D∗ and B∗ ¯B+h.c/B∗ ¯B∗ hadronic molecular
pictures, respectively [7–14].

s

As for the discussed X(5568) or X(5616), we can ﬁnd that
this structure could be decomposed into a bottom-strange me-
son and a light meson or a bottom meson and a strange me-
son. For the former case, the bottom-strange meson and light

meson could not interact by exchanging a conventional quark-
antiquark meson and form a bound state. While for the later
case, the bottom and strange mesons could form a hadronic
molecule state by exchanging a proper light meson. We no-
tice that the thresholds of B ¯K and B∗ ¯K are 5777 and 5822
MeV, respectively [15]. The observed masses of the X(5568)
and X(5616) are about 200 MeV below the thresholds of B ¯K
and B∗ ¯K, respectively. Thus, we can assign the X(5568)
and X(5616) reported by the D0 Collaboration as a deeply
bounded B ¯K or B∗ ¯K hadronic molecule state with I = 1,
which is diﬀerent with the one discussed in Ref. [16].

To further check the possibilities of the X(5565) and
X(5616) as a B ¯K and a B∗ ¯K hadronic molecule state, we study
the strong decays of the B ¯K and B∗ ¯K hadronic molecule states
in present work. Due to the kinematic limit, the X(5565) and
X(5616) can only strongly decay into Bsπ and B∗sπ, respec-
tively, which is the observed channel of these states. The ap-
proach for describing and treating the deuteron-like hadronic
molecule state has been proposed in Refs. [17, 18] and devel-
oped in Refs. [19–21]. This approach has been widely used
to study the decay behaviors of the hadronic molecule [5, 12–
14, 19–23].

This work is organized as follows: The molecule structure
of the X(5568) and X(5616) and their decays are present in
the following section. The numerical results and discussions
for the decays are presented in Section III, and Section IV is
dedicated to a short summary.

X(5568) AND X(5616) AND THEIR DECAYS

hadronic molecule structure.— In the present work, we
consider the X(5568) and X(5616) as hadronic molecules with
I = 1, represented by a B ¯K and B∗ ¯K S−wave bound state,
respectively. The JPC quantum numbers of the X(5568) and
X(5616) are 0++ and 1++, respectively. The interactions of
the hadronic molecule states with their components could be

ωi j = mi/(mi + m j) is the kinematical parameter. The corre-
lation function Φ(y) is employed to describe the distributions
of the molecular components in the hadronic molecule and
to render the Feynman diagrams ultraviolet ﬁnite as well. In
the present calculations, a Gaussian form of the correlation
function is adopted, which has been widely used to investi-
gate the hadronic molecule decays [5, 12–14, 19–23]. The
Fourier transform of the correlation function ˜Φ(PE) is in the
form,

˜Φ(PE) ˙=exp(−P2

E/Λ2)

(2)

where PE is the Jacobi momentum in the Euclidean space, and
Λ is a model parameter which characterizes the distribution of
the components in the hadronic molecule. The concrete value
of the Λ should be of order 1 GeV and dependent on a diﬀerent
molecular system [5, 12–14, 19–23].

The coupling strength of a hadronic molecule to its com-
ponents could be evaluated from the compositeness condition
[17, 18], in which the renormalization constant of a compos-
ite particle wave function is zero. As for the discussed scalar
hadronic molecule, X(5568), the renormalization constants is

which would overlap in the Bsπ invariant mass spectra.
In
this case, the present experimental measurement could not
distinguish this two states [1]. However, the X(5616) state
can radiatively transit into B∗s and Bs, while the X(5568) can
only decay to B∗sγ. The future experimental measurements of
the radiative decays of the neutral X(5568) and X(5616) could
provide us more information about the structure observed by
the D0 Collaboration [1].

IV. SUMMARY

To summarize, we interpret the newly observed structure
X(5568) and X(5616) as S−wave deeply bound state of B ¯K
and B∗ ¯K, respectively. With an eﬀective Lagrangian ap-
proach, we estimate the partial decay widths X(5568) → B0
sπ+
and X(5616) → B∗0
s π+. Our results indicate both explana-
tions could be acceptable since the constrained model param-
eter Λ are of order 1.0 GeV. Since both BK and B∗K hadronic
molecule could exist in the structure observed by D0 collabo-
ration [1], we propose to study these states by radiative decay
experimentally, which would help us to further understand the
observed structure in the Bsπ invariant mass spectrum by the
D0 Collaboration [1].
