Abstract

We consider a system of urns of Polya-type, with balls of two colors; the reinforcement
of each urn depends both on the content of the same urn and on the average content of all
urns. We show that the urns synchronize almost surely, in the sense that the fraction of balls
of a given color converges almost surely, as the time goes to inﬁnity, to the same limit for all
urns. A normal approximation for a large number of urns is also obtained.

1 Introduction

Synchronization phenomena for stochastic systems have raised a considerable interest in the last
decade, both for their impact in applications and their intrinsic mathematical beauty. We make
no attempt of giving an overview of the many lines of research related to synchronization; we
rather mention only two of them, which are related but developed mostly independently.

The word synchronization is often referred to phase synchronization of pulsating systems.
Interesting examples are provided by cellular dynamics. Concentration of certain molecules within
cells vary over time due to chemical reaction, and may lead to a periodic behavior. Chemical
reactions may also involve molecules in the extracellular space, producing interaction between
diﬀerent cells: phase synchronization is actually observed when the interaction is suﬃciently
strong (see [13] for an account and a remarkable application). For this and other applications, a

stochastic model that reasonably approximates the dynamics of phases is a noisy version of the
Kuramoto model ([6, 1]). It is a system of N coupled random rotators that, for a suﬃciently small
coupling parameter show decoherence of phases: if θj(t) denotes the phase of the j-th oscillator
at time t, then the distribution of

eiθj (t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

is, for large N and large t, concentrated near zero. Such decoherence is lost as the coupling
parameter is increased beyond a critical value.

In other contexts, the notion of synchronization is used even in absence of an underlying
periodic motion. In some models for metastable behavior (see e.g. [2, 3]), one considers a system
of many particles subject to a symmetric, double-well potential, and interacting through an
attractive potential that, in the models that are more mathematically treatable, is assumed of
mean ﬁeld type. At suﬃciently low temperature, the majority of particles are found in the same
well, thus breaking the symmetry of the model. Synchronization, in this context, is this coherent
behavior of the majority.

In this paper we also consider a system whose components are subject to an attractive, mean
ﬁeld interaction. We however add an ingredient to the model: reinforcement. Generally speaking,
by reinforcement in a stochastic dynamic we mean any mechanism for which the probability that
a given transition occurs has an increasing dependence on the number of times that “similar”
transitions has taken place in the past. The most elementary model of reinforcement is the Polya
urn.

The simplest Polya urn model consists of an urn which contains balls of two diﬀerent colors
(for example, at time t = 0, b white and a red balls). At each discrete time a ball is drawn out
and it is replaced in the urn together with another ball of the same color.
Let Zt be the fraction of red balls at time t, namely, the conditional probability of drawing a red
ball at time t + 1, given the fraction of red balls at time t.
A well known result (see for instance [5]) says that Zt is a bounded martingale and in particular
limt→∞ Zt = Z∞ a.s., where Z∞ has Beta distribution with parameters a and b.

Here we present a modiﬁed model, in which we consider a set of N Polya’s urns and we

introduce a “mean ﬁeld interaction” among them:

• at time 0, each urn contains a red and b white balls, a ≥ 1, b ≥ 1;
• at each time t + 1, given the fraction Zt(j), for j = 1, . . . , N , of red balls in each urn j at
time t, independently of what happens in all the other urns, a new red ball is replaced in
urn i with conditional probability αZt + (1 − α)Zt(i), where Zt is the total fraction of red
balls at time t, i.e. Zt = 1

i=1 Zt(i) and α ∈ [0, 1].

The case α = 0 corresponds to N independent copies of the classical Polya’s urn described
above. Thus, for i = 1, 2, . . . , N , the Zt(i)’s converge, as t → +∞, to i.i.d. random variables,
whose distribution is Beta with parameters a, b. We show that, for α > 0, Zi(t) is no longer
a martingale; however its almost sure limit as t → +∞ exists, and it is the same for all i =
1, 2, . . . , N . We refer to this phenomenon as almost sure synchronization. We also obtain bounds
on the L2 distance between Zi(t) and Zj(t), i 6= j, which goes to zero uniformly in N and as a
power law in t.
We remark that more general and complex models of interacting Polya urns have been con-
[12, 4, 11, 9]). In particular, urns with mean-ﬁeld

sidered recently by various authors (see e.g.

interaction have been considered in [7, 8], but with a diﬀerent reinforcement scheme: the prob-
ability of drawing a red (or black) ball is proportional to the exponential of the number of red
balls, rather than to the number of red balls, leading to a quite diﬀerent synchronization picture.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give some basic properties of the model,
while Section 3 is devoted to synchronization. Finally, in Section 4 we prove a Central Limit
Theorem for Z(t), in the limit as N → +∞.

2.1 Deﬁnition

Consider a probability space in which a family {U (t, i); t, i ∈ N} of i.i.d. random variables with
uniform distribution on [0, 1] is deﬁned.
For example, we take Ω = [0, 1]N2
(where B([0, 1]) and λ denote
respectively the Borel sigma-algebra and the Lebesgue measure on [0, 1]), and the U (t, i)’s are

, F = B([0, 1])⊗N2

, P = λ⊗N2

the canonical projections. We pose Ft = σ(cid:0)U (s, i); 0 ≤ s ≤ t, i ∈ N(cid:1).

3 Synchronization

In this section we show that, as soon as α > 0, the urns synchronize almost surely, i.e. for each
i = 1, . . . , N ,

almost surely. We proceeds in two steps. First we show L2-synchronization, i.e.

lim
t→+∞

Zt(i) = lim

Then, using bounds on the L2-rate of convergence, we derive the almost sure synchronization.

Eh(Zt(i) − Zt)2i = 0.

By Lemma 1, Var[Zt] tends to zero as N → +∞. Finally, since xt satisﬁes (2), it is easily proved
by induction on t that xt has a limit x∞t as N → +∞, and this limit satisﬁes (8).
