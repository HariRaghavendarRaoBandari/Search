Existence of Strong and Nontrivial Solutions to Strongly

Coupled Elliptic Systems

Dung Le1

Abstract

We establish the existence of strong solutions to a class of nonlinear strongly coupled
and uniform elliptic systems consisting of more than two equations. The existence of of
nontrivial and non constant solutions (or pattern formations) will also be studied.

Introduction

In this paper, we study the existence of strong solutions and other nontrivial solutions to
the following nonlinear strongly coupled and nonregular but uniform elliptic system

( −div(A(u, Du)) = ˆf (u, Du) in Ω,

u satisﬁes Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on ∂Ω.

(1.1)

Here, Ω is a bounded domain with smooth boundary ∂Ω in IRn, n ≥ 2. A typical point

in IRn is denoted by x. The k-order derivatives of a vector valued function

u(x) = (u1(x), . . . , um(x)) m ≥ 2

are denoted by Dku. A(u, Du) is a full matrix m × n and ˆf : IRm × IRnm → IRm. Also, for
a vector or matrix valued function f (u, ζ), u ∈ IRm and ζ ∈ IRd, its partial derivatives will
be denoted by fu, fζ.

Throughout this paper, we always assume the following on the diﬀusion matrix A(u, Du).

A) A(u, ζ) is C 1 in u ∈ IRm and ζ ∈ IRmn. There are a constant C∗ > 0 and a nonnegative

scalar C 1 function λ(u) such that for any u ∈ IRm and ζ, ξ ∈ IRnm

λ(u)|ζ|2 ≤ hAζ(u, ζ)ξ, ξi and |Aζ(u, ζ)| ≤ C∗λ(u).

(1.2)

Moreover, there are positive constants C, λ0 such that λ(u) ≥ λ0 and |Au(u, ζ)| ≤
C|λu(u)||ζ|. In addition, A(u, 0) = 0 for all u ∈ IRm.

The ﬁrst condition in (1.2) is to say that the system (1.1) is elliptic.

If λ(u) is also
bounded from above by a constant for all u ∈ IRm, we say that A is regular elliptic.
Otherwise, A is uniform elliptic if (1.2) holds.

Furthermore, the constant C∗ in (1.2) concerns the ratio betweeen the largest and small-
est eigenvalues of Aζ. We assume that these constants are not too far apart in the following
sense.

SG) (The spectral gap condition) C∗ < (n − 2)/(n − 4) if n > 4.

We note that if SG) is somewhat violated, i.e. C∗ is large, then examples of blowing up
in ﬁnite time can occur for the corresponding parabolic systems (see [2]). Of course, this
condition is void in many applications when we usually have n ≤ 4.

By a strong solution of (1.1) we mean a vector valued function u ∈ W 2,p(Ω, IRm) for any

p > 1 that solves (3.1) a.e. in Ω and Du ∈ C α(Ω, , IRm), α ∈ (0, 1).

As usual, W k,p(Ω, IRm), where k is an integer and p ≥ 1, denotes the standard Sobolev

spaces whose elements are vector valued functions u : Ω → IRm with ﬁnite norm

kukW k,p(Ω,IRm) = kukLp(Ω,IRm) +

kDkukLp(Ω,IRkmn).

k

Xi=1

Similarly, C k,α(Ω, IRm) denotes the space of (vector valued) functions u on Ω such that Dlu,
l = 0, . . . , k, are H¨older continuous with exponent α ∈ (0, 1). If the range IRm is understood
from the context we will usually omit it from the above notations.

The system (1.1) occurs in many applications concerning steady states of diﬀusion pro-
cesses with cross diﬀusion taken into account, i.e. A(u, Du) is a full matrix (see [11] and the
reference therein). In the last few decades, there are many studies of (1.1) under the main
assumption that its solutions are bounded. The lack of maximum principles for systems of
more than one equations has limited the range of application of those results. Occasionally,
works in this direction usually tried to establish L∞ bounds for solutions via ad hoc tech-
niques and thus imposed restrictive assumptions on the structural conditions of the systems.
On the other hand, even if L∞ boundedness of solutions were known, counterexamples in
[10] showed that this does not suﬃce to guarantee higher regularity of the solutions.

Our ﬁrst goal is to establish the existence of a strong solution to the general (1.1) when
its L∞ boundedness is not available. Since the system is not variational and comparison
principles are generally unvailable, techniques in variational methods and monotone dy-
namical systems are not applicable here. Fixed point index theories will then be more
appropriate to study the existence of solutions to (1.1). However, it is well known that the
main ingredients of this approach are: 1) to deﬁne compact map T , whose ﬁxed points are
solutions to (1.1), on some appropriate Banach space X; 2) to show that the Leray Schauder
ﬁxed point index of T is nonzero. The second part requires some uniform estimates of the
ﬁxed points of T and regularity properties of solutions to (1.1). Those are the fundamental
and most technical problems in the theory of partial diﬀerential equations. In this work, we
will show that the crucial regularity property can be obtained if we know a priori that the
solutions are VMO or BMO in the case of large self diﬀusion. We will show that the result
applies to the generalized SKT systems ([25]) when the dimension of Ω is less than 5.

To this end, and throughout this work, we will impose the following structural conditions

on the reaction term ˆf .

F) There exists a constant C such that for any C 1 functions u : Ω → IRm and p : Ω → IRmn

satisfying |Du| ≤ |p| the following holds.

|D ˆf (u, p)| ≤ C[λ(u)|Dp| + |λu(u)||Du||p| + λ(u)||p|].

(1.3)

2

In addition, we can see that F) typically holds if there exist a constant C and a function

f (u) which is C 1 in u such that

| ˆf (u, p)| ≤ Cλ(u)|p| + f (u),

|fu(u)| ≤ Cλ(u).

(1.4)

For simplicity, we are assuming a linear growth in p on ˆf . In fact, the main existence

results in this work allow the following nonlinear growth for ˆf

| ˆf (u, p)| ≤ Cλ(u)|p|α + f (u)

for some α ∈ [1, 2),

and such that

|D ˆf (u, p)| ≤ C[λ(u)|p|α−1|Dp| + |λu(u)||Du||p|α + λ(u)|p|α].

The proof is similar with minor modiﬁcations (see Remark 2.7).

To establish the existence of a strong solution, we embed (1.1) in a suitable family of

systems with σ ∈ [0, 1]

( −div( ˆAσ(U, DU )) = ˆFσ(U, DU ) in Ω,

Homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on ∂Ω.

(1.5)

The data ˆAσ, ˆFσ satisfy A), F) and SG) with the same set of constants. We then consider
a family of compact maps T (σ, ·) associated to the above systems and use a homotopy
argument to compute the ﬁxed point index of T . Again, the key point is to establish some
uniform estimates of the ﬁxed points of T (σ, ·) and regularity properties of their ﬁxed points.
The uniform estimates for H¨older norms and then higher norms of solutions to the above
systems come from the crucial and technical Proposition 2.1 in Section 2 which shows that
one needs only a uniform control of the W 1,2(Ω) and V M O(Ω) norms of (unbounded) strong
solutions to the systems. Roughly speaking, we assume that for any given µ0 > 0 there is
a positive Rµ0 for which the strong solutions to the systems in (1.5) satisfy

Λ2 sup
x0∈ ¯Ω

kU k2

BM O(Bx0 ) ≤ µ0.

(1.6)

The proof of this result relies on a combination of a local weighted Gagliardo-Nirenberg
inequality which is proved in our recent work [17] (see also [14]) and a new iteration argument
using decay estimates. This technique was used in our work [17] to establish the global
existence of solutions to strongly coupled parabolic systems. The proof for the elliptic case
in this paper is somewhat simpler and requires less assumptions but needs some subtle
modiﬁcations. For the sake of completeness and the convenience of the readers we present
the details.

The fact that bounded weak V M O solutions to regular elliptic systems are H¨older con-
tinuous is now well known (see [8]). Here, using a completely diﬀerent approach, we deal
with unbounded strong V M O solutions and our Proposition 2.1 applies to nonregular sys-
tems. Eventually, we obtain that the strong solutions to the systems of (1.5) are uniformly
H¨older continuous. Desired uniform estimates for higher norms of the solutions then follow.
Once this technical result is established, our ﬁrst main result in Section 3, Theorem 3.2,
then shows that (1.1) has a strong solution if the strong solutions of (1.5) are uniformly
bounded in W 1,2(Ω) and V M O(Ω).

3

We present some examples in applications where Theorem 3.2 can apply. The main
theme in these examples is to establish the uniform boundedness of the of solutions to (1.1)
in W 1,n(Ω), so that the solutions are in W 1,2(Ω) and V M O(Ω). In fact, under suitable
assumptions, which occur in many mathematical models in biology and ecology, on the
structural of (1.1) we will show that it is suﬃcient to control the very weak L1 norms of the
solutions if the dimension n ≤ 4. Typical example in applications are the generalized SKT
models (see [25]) consisting of more than 2 equations and allowing arbitrary growth condi-
tions in the diﬀusion and reaction terms (see Corollary 3.10). For n = 2 our Corollary 3.9
generalizes a result of [21] where A(u, Du) was assumed to be independent of u.

Next, we will discuss the existence of nontrivial solutions in Section 4. We now see
that Theorem 3.2 establishes the existence of a strong solution in X to (1.1). However,
this result provides no interesting information if some ’trivial’ or ’semi trivial’ solutions,
which are solutions to a subsystem of (1.1), are obviously guaranteed by other means. We
will be interested in ﬁnding other nontrivial solutions to (1.1) and the uniform estimates in
Section 3 still play a crucial role here. Although many results in this section, in particular
the abstract results in Section 4.1, can apply to the general (1.1) we restrict ourselves to
the system

( −div(A(u)Du) = ˆf (u)

Homogenenous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on ∂Ω.

in Ω,

(1.7)

This problem is the prototype of a general class of nonlinear elliptic systems which arise
in numerous applications, where u usually denotes population/chemical density vector of
species/agents. Therefore, we will also be interested in ﬁnding positive solutions of this
system, i.e. those are in the positive cone

P := {u ∈ X : u = (u1, . . . , um), ui(x) ≥ 0 ∀x ∈ Ω}.

Under suitable assumptions on ˆf , we will show that T can be deﬁned as a map on a bounded
set of P into P, i.e. T is a positive map.

If ˆf (0) = 0 then (1.7) has the trivial solution u = 0. A solution u is a semi trivial
solution if some components of u are zero. Roughly speaking, we decompose X = X1 ⊕ X2,
accordingly P = P1 ⊕ P2 with Pi being the positive cone of Xi, and write an element of
X as (u, v) with u ∈ X1, v ∈ X2. Then w = (u, 0), with u > 0, is a semi trivial positive
ﬁxed point if w is a ﬁxed point of T in P and u is a ﬁxed point of T |P1, the restriction
of T to P1. We then show that the local indices of T at these semi ﬁxed points are solely
determined by those of T |P1 at P2-stable ﬁxed points.

Finally,

The existence of nontrivial solutions then follows if the sum of the local ﬁxed point
indices at trivial and semi trivial solutions does not at up to the ﬁxed point index of T in
P. Several results on the structure of (1.1) will be given to show that this will be the case.
in Section 5 if Neumann boundary conditions are considered then it could
happen that a nontrivial and constant solution of (1.7) exists and solves ˆf (u) = 0.
In
this case, the conclusion in the previous section does not provide useful information. We
are then interested in ﬁnding nontrivial nonconstant solutions to (1.7). The results in this
section greatly improve those in [12, 16], which dealt only with systems of two equations,
and establish the eﬀect of cross diﬀusions in ’pattern formation’ problems in mathematical

4

biology and chemistry. Besides the fact that our results here can be used for large systems,
the analysis provides a systematic way to study pattern formation problems. Further studies
and examples will be reported in our forthcoming paper [18]. We conclude the paper by
presenting a simple proof of the fact that nonconstant solutions do not exist if the diﬀusion
is suﬃciently large.

2 A-priori estimates in W 1,p(Ω) and H¨older continuity

In this section we will establish key estimates for the proof of our main theorem Theorem 3.2
asserting the existence of strong solutions. Throughout this section, we consider two vector
valued functions U, W from Ω into IRm and solve the following system

− div(A(W, DU )) = ˆf (W, DU ).

(2.1)

We will consider the following assumptions on U, W in (2.1).

U.0) A, ˆf satisfy A),F) and SG) with u = W and ζ = DU .

U.1) U ∈ W 2,2(Ω) ∩ C 1(Ω) and W ∈ C 1(Ω). On the boundary ∂Ω, U satisﬁes Neumann

or Dirichlet boundary conditions.

U.2) There is a constant C such that |DW | ≤ C|DU | a.e. in Ω.

U.3) The following number is ﬁnite:

Λ = sup

W ∈IRm

|λW (W )|

λ(W )

.

(2.2)

In the sequel, we will ﬁx a number q0 > 1 if n ≤ 4 and, otherwise, q0 > (n − 2)/2 such

that

2q0 − 2

2q0

= δq0C −1

∗

for some δq0 ∈ (0, 1).

(2.3)

Such numbers q0, δq0 always exist if A) and SG) hold. In fact, if n ≤ 4 we choose q0 > 1
and suﬃciently close to 1; if n > 4, by our assumption SG), we have n−4
and we
can choose q0 > (n − 2)/2 and q0 is suﬃciently close to (n − 2)/2.

n−2 < C −1

∗

The main result of this section shows that if kU kBM O(BR(x0)∩Ω) is suﬃciently small when

R is uniformly small then for some p > n kDU kLp(Ω) can be controlled.

Proposition 2.1 Suppose that U.0)-U.3) hold. Assume that there exists µ0 ∈ (0, 1), which
is suﬃciently small, in terms of the constants in A) and F), such that the following holds.

D) there is a positive Rµ0 such that

Λ2 sup
x0∈ ¯Ω

kU k2

BM O(Bµ0

(x0)∩Ω) ≤ µ0,

(2.4)

Then there are q > n/2 and a constant C depending on the constants in U.0)-U.3),

q, Rµ0, the geometry of Ω and kDU kL2(Ω) such that

|DU |2q dx ≤ C.

ZΩ

(2.5)

In particular, if U is also in L1(Ω) then U belongs to C α(Ω) for some α > 0 and its

norm is bounded by a similar constant C as in (2.5).

The dependence of C in (2.5) on the geometry of Ω is in the following sense: Let µ0 be

as in D). We can ﬁnd balls BRµ0

(xi), xi ∈ ¯Ω, such that

¯Ω ⊂ ∪

Nµ0
i=1 BRµ0

(xi),

(2.6)

then C in (2.5) also depends on the number Nµ0.

The proof of Proposition 2.1 relies on local estimates for the integral of |DU | in ﬁnitely
many balls BR(xi) with suﬃciently small radius R to be determined by the condition D).
We will establish local estimates for DU in these balls and then add up the results to obtain
the global estimate (2.5).

2.1 Local Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities involving BMO norms

We ﬁrst present Lemma 2.4, one of our main ingredients in the the proof of Proposition 2.1.
This lemma is a simple consequence of the following local weighted Gagliardo-Nirenberg
inequality which is proved in our recent work [17]. In order to state the assumption for that
inequality, we recall some well known notions from Harmonic Analysis. For γ ∈ (1, ∞) we
say that a nonnegative locally integrable function w belongs to the class Aγ or w is an Aγ
weight if the quantity

[w]γ := sup

BR(y)⊂Ω ZBR(y)

w dx! ZBR(y)

w1−γ ′

dx!γ−1

is ﬁnite.

(2.7)

Here, γ′ = γ/(γ − 1). For more details on these classes we refer the readers to [6, 22, 26].

We proved in [17] the following result.

Lemma 2.2 [17, Lemma 2.2] Let u, U : Ω → IRm be vector valued functions with u ∈
C 1(Ω), U ∈ C 2(Ω) and Φ : IRm → IR be a C 1 function such that

GN) Φ(u)

2
p+2 belongs to the A p

p+2 +1 class.

For any ball Bt in Ω we set

I1(t) := ZBt

Φ2(u)|DU |2p+2 dx, ˆI1(t) := ZBt

Φ2(u)|Du|2p+2 dx,

¯I1(t) := ZBt

|Φu(u)|2(|DU |2p+2 + |Du|2p+2) dx,

(2.8)

(2.9)

and

I2(t) := ZBt

Φ2(u)|DU |2p−2|D2U |2 dx.

(2.10)

Consider any ball Bs concentric with Bt, 0 < s < t, and any nonnegative C 1 function
ψ such that ψ = 1 in Bs and ψ = 0 outside Bt. Then, for any ε > 0 there are positive
constants Cε, Cε,Φ, depending on ε and [Φ

p+2 +1, such that

I1(s) ≤ ε[I1(t) + ˆI1(t)] + Cε,ΦkU k2

BM O(Bt)(cid:2) ¯I1(t) + I2(t)(cid:3)

|Φ|2(u)|DU |2p dx.

(2.11)

Remark 2.3 By approximation, see [24], the lemma also holds for u ∈ W 1,2(Ω) and U ∈
W 2,2(Ω) provided that the quantities I1, I2 and ˆI1 deﬁned in (2.8)-(2.10) are ﬁnite.

If Φ ≡ 1 then ¯I1 ≡ 0 and we can take u = U . The condition GN) is clearly satisﬁed as
[Φ]γ = 1 for all γ > 1 (see (2.7)) and Φu = 0. It is then clear that we have the following
special version of the above lemma.

Lemma 2.4 Let U : Ω → IRm be a vector valued function in C 2(Ω). For any ball Bt in Ω
we set

I1(t) := ZBt

|DU |2p+2 dx, I2(t) := ZBt

|DU |2p−2|D2U |2 dx.

(2.12)

Consider any ball Bs concentric with Bt, 0 < s < t, and any nonnegative C 1 function
ψ such that ψ = 1 in Bs and ψ = 0 outside Bt. Then, for any ε > 0 there is a positive
constant Cε such that

I1(s) ≤ εI1(t) + CεkU k2

BM O(Bt)I2(t)

+CεkU kBM O(Bt) supx∈Bt |Dψ(x)|2ZBt

|DU |2p dx.

(2.13)

2.2 The proof of Proposition 2.1

In the proof, we will only consider the case when BR(xi) ⊂ Ω. The boundary case (xi ∈ ∂Ω)
is similar, using the fact that ∂Ω is smooth and a reﬂection argument to extend the function
U or DU outside Ω, see Remark 2.9 and Remark 2.10.

For any x0 ∈ ¯Ω and t > 0 we will denote Bt(x0) = Bt(x0) ∩ Ω. For q ≥ 1 we introduce

the following quantities.

Bq(t, x0) = ZBt(x0)

|DU |2q+2 dx,

Hq(t, x0) = ZBt(x0)

|DU |2q−2|D2U |2 dx,

Gq(t, x0) = ZBt(x0)

|DU |2q dx.

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

In the rest of this section, let us ﬁx a point x0 in Ω and drop x0 in the notations

(2.14)-(2.16).

7

For any s, t such that 0 < s < t ≤ R let ψ be a cutoﬀ function for two balls Bs, Bt
centered at x0. That is, ψ is nonnegative, ψ ≡ 1 in Bs and ψ ≡ 0 outside Bt with
|Dψ| ≤ 1/(t − s).

We ﬁrst have the following local energy estimate.

Lemma 2.5 Asume U.0)-U.3). Assume that q ≥ 1 satisﬁes the condition

2q − 2

2q

= δqC −1

∗

for some δq ∈ (0, 1).

(2.17)

There is a constant C1(q) depending also on the constants in A) and F) such that

Hq(s) ≤ C1(q)(cid:20)Λ2Bq(t) +

1

(t − s)2 Gq(t)(cid:21)

0 < s < t ≤ R.

(2.18)

Proof: By the assumption U.1), we can formally diﬀerentiate (2.1) with respect to x,

more precisely we can use diﬀerence quotients (see Remark 2.6), to get the weak form of

− div(Aζ(W, DU )D2U + AW (W, DU )DW DU ) = D ˆf (W, DU ).

(2.19)

We denote β(W ) = λ−1(W ). Testing (2.19) with φ = β(W )|DU |2q−2DU ψ2, which is

legitimate since Hq is ﬁnite, integrating by parts in x and rearranging, we have

ZΩ

hAζ(W, DU )D2U + AW (W, DU )DW DU, Dφi dx = ZQ

hD ˆf (W, DU ), φi dx.

(2.20)

For simplicity, we will assume in the proof that ˆf ≡ 0. As Dφ = I0 + I1 + I2 with

I0 := β(W )D(|DU |2q−2DU )ψ2, I1 := |DU |2q−2DU βW DW ψ2,

and I2 := 2β(W )|DU |2q−2DU ψDψ, we can rewrite (2.20) as

ZΩ

β(W )hAζ (W, DU )D2U, D(|DU |2q−2DU )ψ2i dx

= −ZΩ

[hAζ (W, DU )D2U, I1 + I2i + hAW (W, DU )DW, Dφi] dx.

(2.21)

Let us ﬁrst consider the integral on the left hand side. By U.0) and the uniform ellipticity
of Aζ(W, DU ), we can ﬁnd a constant C∗ such that |Aζ(W, DU )ζ| ≤ C∗λ(W )|ζ|. On the
other hand, By (2.17), α = 2q − 2 satisﬁes

α

By [2, Lemma 2.1], or [14, Lemma 6.2], for such α, q there is a positive constant C(q) such
that

hAζ(W, DU )D2U, D(|DU |2q−2DU )i ≥ C(q)λ(W )|DU |2q−2|D2U |2.

(2.22)

Because β(W )λ(W ) = 1, we then obtain from (2.21)

C0(q)ZQ

[hAζ (W, DU )D2U, I1 + I2i + hAW (W, DU )DW, Dφi] dx.

(2.23)

The terms I1, I2 in the integrands on the right hand side of (2.23) can be easily handled

by using the fact that |Dψ| ≤ 1/(t − s) and the assumption A) which gives

|Aζ(W, DU )| ≤ C|λ(W )| and |AW (W, DU )| ≤ C|λW (W )||DU |.

We also note that |βW (W )| = λ−2(W )|λW (W )| ≤ λ−1(W )Λ (see (2.2)).

Concerning the ﬁrst integrand on the right of (2.21), using the deﬁnition of Ii and

Young’s inequality, for any ε > 0 we can ﬁnd a constant C(ε) such that

|hAζ(W, DU )D2U, I1i| ≤ ε|DU |2q−2|D2U |2ψ2 + C(ε)Λ2|DW |2|DU |2qψ2,

|hAζ (W, DU )D2U, I2i| ≤ ε|DU |2q−2|D2U |2ψ2 + C(ε)|DU |2q|Dψ|2.

Similarly, for the second integrand on the right of (2.21) we have

|hAW (W, DU )DW, I0i| ≤ ε|DU |2q−2|D2U |2ψ2 + C(ε)Λ2|DW |2|DU |2qψ2,

|hAW (W, DU )DW, I1i| ≤ CΛ2|DW |2|DU |2qψ2,

|hAW (W, DU )DW, I2i| ≤ CΛ2|DW |2|DU |2qψ2 + C|DU |2q|Dψ|2.

Choosing ε suﬃciently small, we then obtain from the above inequalities and the as-

sumption |DW | ≤ C|DU | that

ZBs

|DU |2q−2|D2U |2 dx ≤ C1Λ2ZBt

|DU |2q+2 dx + C1

1

(t − s)2ZBt

|DU |2q dx.

From the notations (2.14)-(2.16), the above estimate gives the lemma.

Remark 2.6 For i = 1, . . . , n and h 6= 0 we denote by δi,h the diﬀerence quotient operator
δi,hu = h−1(u(x + hei) − u(x)), with ei being the unit vector of the i-th axis in IRn. We
then apply δi,h to the system for U and then test the result with |δi,hU |2q−2δi,hU ψ2. The
proof then continues to give the desired energy estimate by letting h tend to 0.

Remark 2.7 If ˆf 6= 0 then there is an extra term |D ˆf (W, DU )||DU |2q−1ψ2 in (2.23). This
term will give rise to similar terms in the proof. Indeed, by (1.3) in F) with u = W and
p = DU ,

|D ˆf (W, DU )| ≤ C[λ(W )|D2U | + |λW (W )||DW ||DU | + λ(W )|DU |].

As β(W ) = λ−1(W ) and |DW | ≤ C|DU |, for any ε > 0 we can use Young’s inequality and
the deﬁnition of Λ to ﬁnd a constant C(ε) such that

|D ˆf (W, DU )|β(W )|DU |2q−1 ≤ C[|D2U ||DU |2q−1 + Λ|DU |2q+1 + |DU |2q]

≤ ε|DU |2q−2|D2U |2 + Λ2|DU |2q+2 + C(ε)|DU |2q.

Choosing ε > 0 suﬃciently small, we then see that the proof can continue to obtain the

energy estimate (2.18).

Similarly, if we can allow ˆf to have nonlinear growth in DU by replacing (1.3) with

|D ˆf (u, p)| ≤ C[λ(u)|p|α−1|Dp| + |λu(u)||Du||p|α + λ(u)|p|α]

for some α ∈ [1, 2).

Then |D ˆf (W, DU )|β(W )|DU |2q−1 can be estimated by

C[|D2U ||DU |2q+α−2 + Λ|DU |2q+α + |DU |2q+α−1]

Again, by Young’s inequality and q ≥ 1 and α < 2, it is not diﬃcult to see that there is
some exponent γ > 0 depending on α such that the above is bounded by

ε|DU |2q−2|D2U |2 + (Λ2 + ε)|DU |2q+2 + C(ε)|DU |2q + C(ε)(Λγ + 1),

and the proof can continues.

Remark 2.8 Inspecting our proof here and the proof of [14, Lemma 6.2], we can see that
the constant C(q) in (2.22) is decreasing in q and hence C1(q) is increasing in q. Note also
that this is the only place where we need (2.17).

Remark 2.9 We discuss the case when the centers of Bρ, BR are on the boundary ∂Ω.
We assume that U satisﬁes the Neumann boundary condition on ∂Ω. By ﬂattening the
boundary we can assume that BR ∩ Ω is the set

B+ = {x : x = (x1, . . . , xn) with xn ≥ 0 and |x| < R}.

For any point x = (x1, . . . , xn) we denote by ¯x its reﬂection across the plane xn = 0,
i.e., ¯x = (x1, . . . , −xn). Accordingly, we denote by B− the reﬂection of B+. For a function
u given on B+ we denote its even reﬂection by ¯u(x) = u(¯x) for x ∈ B−. We then consider
the even extension of ˆu in B = B+ ∪ B−

ˆu(x) = ( u(x)

¯u(x)

if x ∈ B+,
if x ∈ B−.

With these notations, for x ∈ B+ we observe that divx(DxU ) = div¯x(D¯x ¯U ) and
DxW DxU = D¯x ¯W D¯x ¯U. Therefore, it is easy to see that ˆU satisﬁes in B a system similar
to the one for U in B+. Thus, the proof can apply to ˆU to obtain the same energy estimate
near the boundary.

Remark 2.10 For the Dirichlet boundary condition we make use of the odd reﬂection
¯u(x) = −u(¯x) and then deﬁne ˆu as in Remark 2.9. Since DxiU = 0 on ∂Ω if i 6= n, we
can test the system (2.19), obtained by diﬀerentiating the system of U with respect to xi,
with |DxiU |2q−2DxiU ψ2 and the proof goes as before because no boundary integral terms
ˆU is
appear in the calculation. We need only consider the case i = n. We observe that Dxn
the even extension of DxnU in B therefore ˆU satisﬁes a system similar to (2.19). The proof
then continues.

Next, let us recall the following elementary iteration result in [17] (which is a consequence

of [8, Lemma 6.1, p.192]).

Lemma 2.11 Let F, G, g, h be bounded nonnegative functions in the interval [ρ, R] with g, h
being increasing. Assume that for ρ ≤ s < t ≤ R we have

F (s) ≤ ε0[F (t) + G(t)] + [(t − s)−αg(t) + h(t)],

G(s) ≤ C[F (t) + (t − s)−αg(t) + h(t)]

(2.24)

(2.25)

with C ≥ 0, α, ε0 > 0.

If 2Cε0 < 1 then there is constant c(C, α, ε0) such that

F (s) + G(s) ≤ c(C, α, ε0)[(t − s)−αg(t) + h(t)] ρ ≤ s < t ≤ R.

(2.26)

We are now ready to give the proof of the main result, Proposition 2.1, of this section.
Proof: For any given R0, ε > 0, multiplying (2.13) by Λ2 and using the notations

(2.14)-(2.16), we can ﬁnd a constant Cε such that

Λ2Bq(s) ≤ εΛ2Bq(t) + CεΛ2kU k2

BM O(Bt)Hq(t) + CεkU kBM O(Bt)

Λ2

(t − s)2 Gq(t)

(2.27)

for all s, t such that 0 < s < t ≤ R0.

On the other hand, let q0 > 1 and satisﬁes (2.3). We then have

2q − 2

2q

< C −1

∗

∀q ∈ [1, q0].

Hence (2.17) of Lemma 2.5 holds for q ∈ [1, q0] and we obtain from (2.18) that

Hq(s) ≤ C1(q)Λ2Bq(t) +

C1(q)
(t − s)2 Gq(t),

0 < s < t ≤ R0.

(2.28)

We deﬁne

F (t) = Λ2Bq(t), G(t) = Hq(t), g(t) = max{C1(q0), CεkU kBM O(BR0 )Λ2}Gq(t),

ε0 = max{ε, CεΛ2kU k2

BM O(BR0 )}.

It is clear that (2.27),(2.28) respectively imply (2.24) and (2.25) of Lemma 2.11 with

C = C1(q0), using the fact that (see Remark 2.8) C1(q) is increasing in q.

We ﬁrst choose ε such that 2C1(q0)ε < 1 and then R0 > 0 such that

2C1(q0)CεΛ2kU k2

BM O(BR0 ) < 1.

(2.29)

We thus have 2C1(q)ε0 < 1 so that (2.26) of Lemma 2.11 provide a constant C2 depending
on C1(q0), ε0 such that

Hq(s) + Λ2Bq(s) ≤

C2

(t − s)2 Gq(t),

0 < s < t ≤ R0.

For t = 2s the above gives (if q satisﬁes (2.17))

derive

(2.31)

Now, we will argue by induction to obtain a bound for Aq for some q > n/2. Suppose

that for some q ≥ 1 and q satisﬁes (2.17) we can ﬁnd a constant Cq such that

|DU |2q dx ≤ Cq,

ZΩ

(2.32)

and that (2.29) holds then (2.31) implies similar bound for Hq(R1). We now can cover Ω by
NR1 balls BR1, see (2.6), and add up the estimate (2.31) for Hq(R1) to obtain a constant
C(Ω, R1, NR1 , q) such that

|DU |2q−2|D2U |2 dx ≤ C(Ω, R1, NR1, q, Cq).

(2.33)

ZΩ

Hence, (2.32) and (2.33) yield another constant C(Ω, R1, NR1, q, , Cq) such that

ZΩ

|DU |2q dx +ZΩ

|DU |2q−2|D2U |2 dx ≤ C(Ω, R1, NR1 , q, , Cq).

Therefore, the W 1,2(Ω) norm of |DU |q is bounded. Let n∗ = n/(n − 2) (or any number
greater than 1 if n = 2). By Sobolev’s inequality, the above implies that there is a constant
C(Ω, R1, q∗) such that

|DU |2qq∗ dx ≤ C(Ω, R1, NR1, q∗)

for any q∗ ∈ (1, n∗].

(2.34)

ZΩ

We now see that (2.32) holds again with the exponent q being replaced by qq∗.
Of course, (2.32) holds for q = 1 with C1 = kDU k2

L2(Ω). Hence, for suitable choice of an
integer k0 and q∗ ∈ (1, n∗) to be determined later we deﬁne Lk = qk
∗ and repeat the above
argument, with q = Lk, k0 times as long as Lk ≤ q0, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , k0. We then obtain
from (2.34)

|DU |2Lk0 n∗ dx ≤ C(kDU kL2(Ω), Ω, R1, NR1, q∗, k0).

(2.35)

ZΩ

We now determine q∗ and k0. If n ≤ 4 we let k0 = 1 and q∗ = min{q0, n∗}. Otherwise,
if n > 4, it is clear that we can ﬁnd q∗ ∈ (1, n∗) and an integer k0 such that Lk0 = qk0
∗ = q0.
Since q0 > 1 if n ≤ 4 and q0 > (n − 2)/2 otherwise, it is clear that 2Lk0n∗ > n in both
cases.

Therefore, (2.35) shows that (2.5) holds for q = Lk0n∗ > n/2. Since q∗, k0 depend on q0,
the constant in (2.35) essentially depends on the parameters in U.0)-U.3) and the geometry
of Ω. The proof is complete.

Remark 2.12 From Remark 2.3, we can see that the conclusion of Proposition 2.1 contin-
ues to hold for U ∈ W 2,2 as long as the quantities (2.14)-(2.16) are ﬁnite for q ∈ [1, q0], q0
is ﬁxed in (2.3).

3 Existence of Strong Solutions

We now consider the system (1.1) in this section. Recall that

− div(A(u, Du)) = ˆf (u, Du)

(3.1)

in Ω and u satisﬁes homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on ∂Ω. Through-
out this section we will assume that A, ˆf satisfy A), F) and SG).

To establish the existence of a strong solution, we embed the systems (3.1) in the

following family of systems with σ ∈ [0, 1]

( −div( ˆAσ(U, DU )) = ˆFσ(U, DU ) in Ω,

U satisﬁes homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann BC on ∂Ω.

We will introduce a family of maps T (σ, ·), σ ∈ [0, 1], acting in some suitable Banach
space X such that their ﬁxed points are strong solutions to the above system. We then
use Leray-Schauder’s ﬁxed point index theory to establish the existence of a ﬁxed point of
T (1, ·), which is a strong solution to (3.1).

Fixing some α0 ∈ (0, 1), we consider the Banach space

X := C 1,α0(Ω) (resp. C 1,α0(Ω) ∩ C0(Ω))

(3.2)

if Neumann (resp. Dirichlet) boundary conditions are assumed for (3.1).

For each w ∈ X and σ ∈ [0, 1], we deﬁne

Aσ(w) = Z 1

0

∂2A(σw, tσDw)dt.

Here and in the sequel, we will also use the notations ∂1g(u, ζ), ∂2g(u, ζ) to denote the
partial derivatives of a function g(u, ζ) with respect to its variables u, ζ.

Assume that there is a family of vector valued functions ˆfσ(U, ζ) with σ ∈ [0, 1], U ∈ IRn

and ζ ∈ IRnm such that

f.0) ˆfσ(U, ζ) is continuous in σ and C 1 in U, ζ.

f.1) ˆf0(U, ζ) ≡ 0 and ˆf1(U, ζ) = ˆf (U, ζ) for all U, ζ.

f.2) ˆfσ satisﬁes F) uniformly for σ ∈ [0, 1]. That is, there is a constant C such that for

U ∈ W 2,2(Ω) and W = σU

|D ˆfσ(U, DU )| ≤ C[λ(W )|D2U | + |λW (W )||DW ||DU | + λ(W )|DU |],

a.e. in Ω.

Let K be any constant matrix satisfying

hKu, ui ≥ k|u|2

for some k > 0 and all u ∈ IRm.

(3.3)

13

For a given w ∈ X and σ ∈ [0, 1] we consider the following linear elliptic system for u

( −div(Aσ(w)Du) + Ku + u = ˆfσ(w, Dw) + Kw + σw

Homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on ∂Ω.

in Ω,

(3.4)

From A) and (3.3) we easily see that the system

( −div(Aσ(w)Du) + Ku + u = 0

Homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on ∂Ω

in Ω

has u = 0 as the only solution. From the theory of linear elliptic systems with H¨older
continuous coeﬃcient, (3.4) has a unique strong solution u. We then deﬁne T (σ, w) = u.

As A satisﬁes A), A(σU, 0) = 0. Hence, for σ ∈ (0, 1]

Aσ(U )DU = Z 1

0

Meanwhile A0(U ) = ∂2A(0, 0).

We now deﬁne

∂2A(σU, tσDU )dtDU = σ−1A(σU, σDU ).

(3.5)

ˆAσ(U, ζ) = σ−1A(σU, σζ) σ ∈ (0, 1], ˆA0(U, ζ) = ∂2A(0, 0)ζ.

(3.6)

The ﬁxed points of T (σ, ·), deﬁned by (3.4) with σ ∈ [0, 1], are solutions the following

family of systems

( −div( ˆAσ(U, DU )) = ˆfσ(U, DU ) + (σ − 1)U in Ω,

U satisﬁes homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann BC on ∂Ω.

(3.7)

Remark 3.1 A typical choice of ˆfσ in applications is ˆfσ(U, ζ) = ˆf (σU, σζ).
diﬃcult to see that ˆfσ(U, ζ) satisﬁes f.1)-f.2) if ˆf does.

It is not

3.1 Existence of Strong Solutions:

The main result of this section is the following result.

Theorem 3.2 We assume that A, ˆfσ satisfy A), f.0)-f.2) and SG) and that the following
number is ﬁnite:

Λ = sup

W ∈IRm

|λW (W )|

λ(W )

.

(3.8)

In addition, we assume that the following conditions hold uniformly for any solution U to
(3.7).

U) There is a constant C such that

kU kW 1,2(Ω) ≤ C.

(3.9)

14

M) for any given µ0 > 0 there is a positive Rµ0 for which

Λ2 sup
x0∈ ¯Ω

kU k2

BM O(Bx0 ) ≤ µ0.

(3.10)

Then (3.1) has at least one strong solution.

Proof: We will use Leray-Schauder’s ﬁxed point index theory to establish the existence
of a ﬁxed point of T (1, ·), which is a strong solution to (3.1) and the theorem then follows.
To this end, we will establish the facts.

i) T (σ, ·) : X → X is compact for σ ∈ (0, 1].

ii) ind(T (0, ·), B, X) = 1 (see the deﬁnition of indices below).

iii) A ﬁxed point u = T (σ, u) is a solution to (3.7). For σ = 1, such ﬁxed points are

solutions to (3.1).

iv) There is M > 0, independent of σ ∈ [0, 1] and K, such that any ﬁxed point u(σ) ∈ X

of T (σ, ·) satisﬁes ku(σ)kX < M .

Once i)-iv) are established, the theorem follows from the Leray-Schauder index theory.
Indeed, we let B be the ball centered at 0 with radius M of X and consider the Leray-
Schauder indices

ind(T (σ, ·), B, X)

def
= deg(Id − T (σ, ·), B, 0),

(3.11)

where the right hand side denote the Leray-Schauder degree with respect to zero of the
vector ﬁeld Id − T (σ, ·). This number is well deﬁned because T (σ, ·) is compact (by i)) and
Id − T (σ, ·) does not have zero on ∂B (by iv)).

By the homotopy invariance of the indices, ind(T (σ, ·), B, X) = ind(T (0, ·), B, X), which
is 1 because of ii). Thus, T (σ, ·) has a ﬁxed point in B for all σ ∈ [0, 1]. Our theorem then
follows from iii).

Using regularity properties of solutions to linear elliptic systems with H¨older continuous
coeﬃcients, we see that i) holds. The proof of ii) is standard (see Remark 3.3 after the
proof). Next, iii) follows from the assumption on ˆf1 in f.1).

Finally, the main point of the proof is iv). We have to establish a uniform estimate
for the ﬁxed points of T (σ, ·) in X. To check iv), let u(σ) ∈ X be a ﬁxed point of T (σ, ·),
σ ∈ [0, 1]. We need only consider the case σ > 0. Clearly, u(σ) solves

−div(Aσ(u(σ))Du(σ)) = ˆfσ(u(σ), Du(σ)) + (σ − 1)u(σ)

so that U = u(σ) is a strong solution of (3.7). We need to show that kU kX is uniformly
bounded for σ ∈ [0, 1].

We now denote W = σU and will show that Proposition 2.1 can be applied to the
systems (3.7). As we assume (3.8) and W = σU , with u(σ) ∈ X and U is a strong solution,
the conditions U.1) and U.2) are clearly veriﬁed.

We will see that U.0) is veriﬁed. Firstly, from (3.5) and the assumption that A satisﬁes

A) and we will show that ˆAσ(U, ζ) satisﬁes A) too. Indeed,

h ˆAσ(U, ζ), ζi = hσ−1A(σU, σζ), ζi = hσ−2A(σU, σζ), σζi ≥ λ(σU )|ζ|2,

15

k ˆAσ(U, ζ)k = σ−1kA(σU, σζ)k ≤ C∗λ(σU )|ζ|,

k

∂
∂U

ˆAσ(U, ζ)k = k∂1A(σU, ζ)k ≤ λσU (σU )|ζ|.

Therefore ˆAσ satisﬁes A) with u = σU .

Secondly, from the assumption f.2) on ˆfσ(U, ζ), satisfying F) uniformly for σ ∈ [0, 1],
and the fact that λ(W ) is bounded from below we see that the right hand side of (3.7)
satisﬁes F). Thus, U.0) is satisﬁed for the system (3.7).

Finally, it is clear that (3.10) in the assumption M) gives the condition D) of Proposi-
tion 2.1. The assumption (3.9) of U) yields that kDU kL2(Ω) is bounded (see also Remark 3.4
after the proof). More importantly, the uniform bound in (3.10) then gives some positive
constants µ0, R(µ0) such that Proposition 2.1 applies to U = u(σ), W = σU and gives a uni-
form estimate for ku(σ)kW 1,2q(Ω) for some q > n/2 and σ ∈ [0, 1]. By Sobolev’s imbedding
theorems this shows that u(σ) is H¨older continuous with its norm uniformly bounded with
respect to σ ∈ [0, 1]. Since A is C 1 in u, the results in [8] then imply that Du(σ) ∈ C α(Ω)
for any α ∈ (0, 1) and its norm is uniformly bounded by a constant independent of σ, K.
We then obtain a uniform estimate for ku(σ)kX and iv) is veriﬁed.

We then see that (3.1) has a solution u in X. Furthermore, [8, Chapter 10] shows that

u is a strong solution. The proof is complete.

Remark 3.3 The map T (0, ·) is deﬁned by the following linear elliptic system with constant
coeﬀcients (A0 := A0(w) = ∂2A(0, 0) and ˆf0(w, Dw) ≡ 0)

− div(A0Du) + Ku + u = Kw

(3.12)

with homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. We then consider the fol-
lowing family of systems, with the same boundary conditions, for τ ∈ [0, 1]

− div(A0Du) + Ku + u = τ Kw

(3.13)

and deﬁne the maps H(τ, ·) on X by H(τ, w) = u. The ﬁxed points u of H(τ, ·) satisfy
(3.13) with u = w so that by testing this with u and using A) and (3.3) we easily see that
u = 0. Similarly, H(0, ·) = 0, a constant map. Thus, by homotopy, ind(H(1, ·), B, X) =
ind(H(0, ·), B, X) = 1. Obviously, T (0, ·) = H(1, ·) so that ind(T (0, ·), B, X) = 1.

Remark 3.4 In applications, the assumption on the boundedness of kU kW 1,2(Ω) in U) can
be removed if λ(u) has a polynomial growth in |u| and kU kL1(Ω) is bounded uniformly. We
sketch the proof here. We ﬁrst observe that kU kLq (Ω) is uniformly bounded. In fact, by [8,
Corollary 2.2] and then M), there are constants Cq, C(q, µ0) such that for R ≤ Rµ0

(cid:18) 1
|BR|ZBR

|U − UR|q dx(cid:19)

1
q

≤ CqkU kBM O(BR) ≤ C(q, µ0).

(3.14)

We easily deduct from the above estimate that there is a constant C depending on µ0, Rµ0, Λ
and kU kL1(Ω) such that kU kLq(BRµ0

) ≤ C.

16

For W = σU we now test the system (2.1) with and ψ = (U − U2R)φ2, where φ is a cut

oﬀ function for BR, B2R and satisﬁes |Dφ| ≤ CR−1. We get

ZB2R

λ(W )|DU |2φ2 dx ≤ CZB2R

(|A(W, DU )||U − U2R||Dφ|φ + | ˆf (W, DU )||ψ|) dx.

Inspired by the condition f.2), if λ has a polynomial growth then we can assume that

| ˆf (W, DU )| ≤ Cλ(W )|DU | + Cλ(W )|U |.

Thus, we can use Young’s inequality to obtain the following Caccioppoli type estimate

ZBR

λ(W )|DU |2 dx ≤ CZB2R hR−2λ(W ) + λ(W )|U |i |U − U2R|2 dx.

(3.15)

Let R = Rµ0/2. If λ(W ) has a polynomial growth in W and |W | ≤ |U |, we can apply Young’s
inequality to the right hand side to see that it is bounded in terms of Rµ0, kU kq
Lq (BRµ0
)
and the constant C(q, µ0) in (3.14). Using a ﬁnite covering of Ω and the fact that λ(W )
is bounded from below, we add the above inequalities to obtain a uniform bound for
kDU kL2(Ω). Hence, the assumption U) can be removed in this case.

Remark 3.5 We applied Proposition 2.1 to strong solution in the space X so that U, DU
are bounded and the key quantities B, H are ﬁnite. However, the bound provided by the
proposition did not involve the supremum norms of U, DU but the local BMO norm of U
in M) and the constants in A) and F).

In applications, the following corollary of the above theorem will be more applicable.

Corollary 3.6 The conclusion of Theorem 3.2 holds true if U) and M) are replaced by the
following condition.

M’) There is a constant C such that for any solution U to (3.7).

kU kL1(Ω), kDU kLn(Ω) ≤ C.

(3.16)

Proof: By H¨older’s inequality it is clear that M’) implies U). To establish the uniform
smallness condition M) we can argue by contradiction. We only sketch the idea of the
argument here. If M) is not true then there are sequences of reals {σn} in [0, 1] and {Un}
of solutions of (3.7) converges weakly to some U in W 1,2(Ω) and strongly in L2(Ω) but
kUnkBM O(Brn ) > ε0 for some ε0 > 0 and a positive sequence {rn} coverging to 0. We then
have kUnkBM O(BR) converge to kU kBM O(BR) for any given R > 0. Since DUn is uniformly
bounded in Ln(Ω), it is not diﬃcult to see that DU ∈ Ln(Ω). Hence, by Poincar´e’s inequality
and the continuity of the integral of |DU |n, kU kBM O(BR) can be arbitrarily small. Clearly,
if rn < R then kUnkBM O(Brn ) ≤ kUnkBM O(BR). Choosing R suﬃciently small and letting n
tend to inﬁnity, kUnkBM O(Brn ) can be arbitrarily small. We obtain a contradiction. Hence,
M) is true and the proof is complete.

17

Remark 3.7 Consider a family of systems (not necessarily deﬁned as in the proof)

( −div( ˆAσ(U, DU )) = ˆFσ(U, DU ) in Ω,

U satisﬁes homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann BC on ∂Ω,

which satisﬁes uniformly the assumptions A), f.0)-f.2) and SG) and that the number Λ
in (3.8) is bounded. If any strong solutions U of the family satisﬁes U) and M) (or M’))
uniformly then argument in the proof of Theorem 3.2 shows that there is a constant C
depending only on the parameters in A), f.0)-f.2), SG), U),M) and Λ in (3.8) such that
kU kX ≤ C.

3.2 Some Examples:

We now present some examples in applications where Theorem 3.2 or Corollary 3.6 can
apply. The main theme in these examples is to establish the uniform bounds (3.16) for the
norms k·kL1(Ω) and kD(·)kLn (Ω) of solutions to (3.7). In fact, under suitable assumptions on
the structural of (3.7), we will show that it is suﬃcient to control L1 norms of the solutions
(see Remark 3.4).

For simplicity we will consider only the following quasilinear system

( −div(A(u)Du) = f (u) in Ω,

u satisﬁes homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann BC on ∂Ω.

(3.17)

Following Remark 3.1, we deﬁne ˆfσ(u, ζ) = f (σu). The corresponding version of (3.7)

is

( −div(A(σu)Du) = f (σu) in Ω, σ ∈ [0, 1],

u satisﬁes homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann BC on ∂Ω.

(3.18)

It is clear that (3.17) is (3.1) with A(u, ζ), ˆf (u, ζ) being A(u)ζ, f (u). We will assume
that these data satisfy A) and F) and that λ(u), f (u) have comparable polynomial growths.

G) Assume that λ(u) ∼ (1+|u|)k and |f (u)| ≤ C|u|l+1 +C for some C, k > 0 and 0 ≤ l ≤ k.

We ﬁrst have the following

Lemma 3.8 Assume G). There is a constant C such that the following holds true for any
solution u to (3.18).

(1 + |σu|k)|D(σu)|2 dx ≤ Cσk+3kukk+2

L1(Ω) + Cσ2kukL1(Ω).

(3.19)

ZΩ

Proof: Testing the system (3.18) with σ2u and using the ellipticity assumption, we

obtain

σ2ZΩ

λ(σu)|Du|2 dx ≤ CσZΩ

hf (σu), σui dx.

From the growth assumptions on λ(u), f (u) in G) and a simple use of Young’s inequality

applying to the right hand side of the above inequality, one gets

ZΩ

(1 + |σu|k)|D(σu)|2 dx ≤ CσZΩ

(|σu|k+2 + |σu|) dx.

(3.20)

We now recall the following inequality, which can be proved easily by using a contra-
diction argument and the fact that W 1,2(Ω) is embedded compactly in L2(Ω): For any
w ∈ W 1,2(Ω), ε > 0 and α ∈ (0, 1] there exists a constant C(ε, α) such that

ZΩ

|w|2 dx ≤ εZΩ

|Dw|2 dx + C(ε, α)(cid:18)ZΩ

|w|α dx(cid:19)

.

(3.21)

Setting w = |σu|

2 and noting that w2 = |σu|k+2 and |Dw|2 ∼ |σu|k|D(σu)|2. Using
the above inequality for α = 2/(k + 2) and suﬃciently small ε > 0, we deduce from (3.20)

k+2

ZΩ

(1 + |σu|k)|D(σu)|2 dx ≤ Cσk+3(cid:18)ZΩ

|u| dx(cid:19)k+2

+ Cσ2ZΩ

|u| dx.

This is (3.19) and the proof is complete.

In particular, (3.19) implies that

|Du|2 dx ≤ Cσk+1kukk+2

L1(Ω) + CkukL1(Ω).

ZΩ

Hence, as k > 0 and σ ∈ [0, 1], there is a constant C depending only on kukL1(Ω) such that
kDukL2(Ω) ≤ C for all solutions to (3.18). The following result immediately follows from
this fact and Corollary 3.6.

Corollary 3.9 Assume G) and that n = 2. If the solutions of (3.18) are uniformly bounded
in L1(Ω) then the system (3.17) has a strong solution.

For the case n = 3, 4 we consider some C 2 map P : IRm → IRm we consider the

generalized SKT system

( −∆(P (u)) = f (u) in Ω,

u satisﬁes homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann BC on ∂Ω.

(3.22)

This system is a generalized version of the SKT model (see [25] where m = 2, n ≤ 2 and
the components of P (u) are assumed to be quadratics). The above system is a special case
of (3.17) if we set A(u) = Pu(u) and assume A) and F).

We then have the following

Corollary 3.10 Assume G) and that n ≤ 4.
bounded in L1(Ω) then the system (3.22) has a strong solution.

If the solutions of (3.23) are uniformly

Proof: Since D(P (σu)) = σA(σu)Du, the system (3.18) now reads

( −∆(P (σu)) = σf (σu) in Ω,

u satisﬁes homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann BC on ∂Ω.

(3.23)

If n = 2 the result was proved in Corollary 3.9. We only consider the case n = 4 as the
case n = 3 is similar and simpler. Again, in this proof, let us denote w := |σu|
and

k+2

M := kukL1(Ω). From (3.19) we see that w ∈ W 1,2(Ω) and we can ﬁnd constants Ci(M )
such that

kwkW 1,2(Ω) ≤ σC1(M ) ⇒ kwkL4(Ω) ≤ σC2(M ),

(3.24)

using Sobolev’s imbedding theorem. From the growth condition on f in G) and Young’s
inequality, |f (σu)| ≤ C(w2 + 1). Therefore, the above estimates and the equation in (3.23)
imply

kf (σu)kL2(Ω) ≤ C3(M ) ⇒ k∆(P (σu))kL2(Ω) ≤ σC4(M ).

(3.25)

On the other hand, since |D(P (σu))| ∼ (1+|σu|k)|D(σu)|, we can use H¨older’s inequality

and (3.19) the bound for kf (σu)kL2(Ω) to see that

|D(P (σu))| dx ≤ k(1 + |σu|k)kL2(Ω)kD(σu)kL2(Ω) ≤ σC5(M ).

ZΩ

Thus, D(P (σu)) ∈ L1(Ω). The last inequality in (3.25) and Schauder’s estimates imply
kD2(P (σu))kL2(Ω) ≤ σC6(M ) for some constant C6(M ). By Sobolev’s inequality,

kD(P (σu))kL4(Ω) ≤ σC7(M ).

Because A(u) = Pu(u) and D(P (σu)) = σA(σu)Du, we have Du = σ−1A−1(σu)D(P (σu)).

As A(u) is elliptic, its inverse is bounded by some constant C. We derive from these facts
and the above estimate that

kDukL4(Ω) ≤ σ−1CkD(P (σu))kL4(Ω) ≤ CC7(M ).

This gives a uniform estimate for kDukL4(Ω) and completes the proof.

We end this section by discussing some special cases where the L1 norm can actually be

controlled uniformly so that the above corollaries are applicable.

Inspired by the SKT model in [25] with competitive Lotka-Volterra reactions, we consider

the following situation.

SKT) For some k > 0 assume that λ(u) ∼ (1 + |u|)k and fi(u) = ui(di − gi(u)) for some

C 1 function g(u) = (g1(u), . . . , gm(u)) satisfying

|g(u)|, |u||∂ug(u)| ≤ C|u|k

(3.26)

for some positive constant C.

Corollary 3.11 Assume SKT). Suppose that there is a positive constants C1 such that

huigi(u), uii ≥ C1|u|k+2.

Xi

(3.27)

Then there is a strong solution to (3.17) (resp. (3.22) when n = 2 (resp. n ≤ 4).

In addition, if Neumann boundary condition is assumed then (3.27) can be replaced by

gi(u)ui ≥ C1|u|k+1.

Xi

20

(3.28)

Proof: We now replace f (σu) in (3.18) by fσ(u) = (f1,σ(u), . . . , fm,σ(u)) with

fi,σ(u) = σkdiui − uigi(σu).

Since |Dfσ(u)| ≤ C[στ + |g(σu)| + σ|u||∂σug(σu)|]|Du|, we see that fσ will satisfy f.0)-
f.2) if the growth condition (3.26) holds. It is easy to see that the argument in the proof
of Lemma 3.8 continues to hold with this new choice of fσ and gives (3.19). Hence, the
assertions on existence of strong solutions of the above corollaries continues to hold if we
can uniformly control the L1(Ω) norm of the solutions. This is exactly what we will do in
the sequel.

Let us consider the assumption (3.27) ﬁrst. We deduce from (3.27) that huigi(σu), uii ≥

C1σk|u|k+2. Therefore, testing the system (3.7) with u, we obtain

ZΩ

λ(σu)|Du|2 dx ≤ C1σkZΩ

|u|2 dx − C2σkZΩ

|u|k+2 dx.

Let w = u in (3.21) and multiply the result with σk to have

σkZΩ

|u|2 dx ≤ εσkZΩ

|Du|2 dx + C(ε, α)σk(cid:18)ZΩ

|u| dx(cid:19)2

.

Because λ(σu) ≥ λ0 > 0, for suﬃciently small ε we deduce from the above two inequal-

ities that there is a constant C4 such that

C2σkZΩ

|u|k+2 dx ≤ C4σk(cid:18)ZΩ

|u| dx(cid:19)2

.

Applying H¨older’s inequality to the left hand side integral, we derive

C5(cid:18)ZΩ

|u| dx(cid:19)k+2

≤ C4(cid:18)ZΩ

|u| dx(cid:19)2

, C5 > 0.

Since k > 0, the above inequality shows that kukL1(Ω) is bounded by a ﬁxed constant.

We now consider the assumption (3.28) and assume the Neumann boundary condition.

Testing the system with 1, we obtain

ZΩ

gi(σu)ui dx = σkZΩ

diui dx.

From (3.28), Pi gi(σu)ui ≥ C1σk|u|k+1. We then derive from the above equation the

following

Again, applying H¨older’s inequality to the left hand side integral, we derive

C1σkZΩ

C2(cid:18)ZΩ

|u|k+1 dx ≤ C(di)σkZΩ
|u| dx(cid:19)k+1

≤ C(di)ZΩ

|u| dx.

|u| dx

for some positive constant C2. Again, as k > 0, the above gives the desired uniform estimate
for kukL1(Ω). The proof is complete.

Remark 3.12 The conditions (3.27) and (3.28) on the positive deﬁniteness of g need only
be assumed for u such that |u| ≥ M for some positive M .

4 On Trivial and Semi Trivial Solutions

We now see that Theorem 3.2 establishes the existence of a strong solution in X to (3.1).
However, the conclusion of this theorem does not provide useful information if some ’triv-
ial’ or ’semi trivial’ solutions, which are solutions to a subsystem of (3.1), are obviously
guaranteed by other means. We will be interested in ﬁnding other nontrivial solutions to
(3.1). To this end, we will ﬁrst investigate these ’trivial’ or ’semi trivial’ solutions. Several
suﬃcient conditions for nontrivial solutions to exist will be presented in Section 4.2.

Many results in this section, in particular the abstract results in Section 4.1, can apply
to the general (3.1). However, for simplicity of our presentation we restrict ourselves to the
system

( −div(A(u)Du) = ˆf (u)

Homogenenous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on ∂Ω.

in Ω,

(4.1)

As in the previous section, we ﬁx some α0 > 0 and let X be C 1,α0(Ω, IRm) (or C 1,α0(Ω) ∩
C0(Ω) if Dirichlet boundary conditions are considered). Under appropriate assumptions,
Theorem 3.2 gives the existence of a strong solution in X to (4.1). This solution may be
trivial. For examples, the trivial solution u = 0 is a solution to the system if ˆf (0) = 0.

Let us discuss the existence of semi trivial solutions. We write IRm = IRm1 ⊕ IRm2
for some m1, m2 ≥ 0 and denote Xi = C 1,α0(Ω, IRmi). By reordering the equations and
variables, we write X = X1 ⊕ X2, an element of X as (u, v) with u ∈ X1, v ∈ X2, and

A(u, v) = " P (u)(u, v) P (v)(u, v)

Q(u)(u, v) Q(v)(u, v) # and ˆf (u, v) = " f (u)(u, v)

f (v)(u, v) # .

Here, P (u)(u, v) and Q(v)(u, v) are matrices of sizes m1 × m1 and m2 × m2 respectively.

Suppose that

Q(u)(u, 0) = 0 and f (v)(u, 0) = 0 ∀u ∈ X1,

(4.2)

then (u, 0), with u 6= 0, is a semi trivial solution if u solves the subsystem

−div(P (u)(u, 0)Du) = f (u)(u, 0).

For each u ∈ X and some constant matrix K we consider the following linear elliptic

system for w.

( −div(A(u)Dw) + Kw = ˆf (u) + Ku

Homogenenous boundary conditions on ∂Ω.

in Ω,

(4.3)

For a suitable choice of K, see (3.3), we can always assume that (4.3) has a unique weak

solution w ∈ X. This is equivalent to say that the elliptic system

( −div(A(u)Dw) + Kw = 0

x ∈ Ω,
Homogenenous boundary conditions on ∂Ω

(4.4)

has w = 0 as the only solution. This is the case if we assume that there is k > 0 such that

hKu, ui ≥ k|u|2 ∀u ∈ IRm.

22

We then deﬁne T (u) := w with w being the weak solution to (4.3). It is clear that the

ﬁxed point solutions of T (u) = u are solutions to (4.1), where w = u.

Since A(u) is C 1 in u, A(u(x)) is H¨older continuous on Ω. The regularity theory of linear
elliptic systems then shows that w ∈ C 1,α(Ω, IRm) for all α ∈ (0, 1) so that T is compact in
X. Furthermore, T is a diﬀerentiable map.

If (4.1) satisﬁes the assumptions of Theorem 3.2 then there is M > 0 such that

T (u) = u ⇒ kukX < M.

(4.5)

In applications, we are also interested in ﬁnding solutions that are positive. We then

consider the positive cone in X

P := {u ∈ X : u = (u1, . . . , um), ui ≥ 0 ∀i},

which has nonempty interior

˙P := {u ∈ X : u = (u1, . . . , um), ui > 0 ∀i}.

Let M be the number provided by Theorem 3.2 in (4.5). We denote by B := BX(0, M )
the ball in X centered at 0 with radius M . If T maps B ∩ P into P then, since P is closed
in X and convex and it is a retract of X (see [4]), we can deﬁne the cone index ind(T, U, P)
for any open subset U of B ∩ P as long as T has no ﬁxed point on ∂U , the boundary of U
in P ([1, Theorem 11.1]).

The argument in the proof of Theorem 3.2 can apply here to give

ind(T, B ∩ P, P) = 1.

This yields the existence of a ﬁxed point of T , or a solution to (4.1), in P. From the
previous discussion, this solution may be trivial or semi trivial. To establish the existence
of a nontrivial positive solution u, i.e. u ∈ ˙P, we will compute the local indices of T at its
trivial and semi trivial ﬁxed points. If these indices do not add up to ind(T, B ∩ P, P) = 1
then the existence of nontrivial solutions follows from [1, Corollary 11.2].

4.1 Some general index results

We then consider the case when (4.1) has trivial or semi trivial solutions. That is when
u = 0 or some components of u is zero. We will compute the local indices of the map T (u)
at these trivial or semi trivial solutions. The abstract results in this section are in fact
independent of (4.1) and thus can apply to (3.1) and other general situations as well.

We decompse X as X = X1 ⊕ X2 and denote by Pi and ˙Pi, i = 1, 2, the positive cones
and their nonempty interiors in Xi’s. We assume (see also (4.5)) that there is M > 0 such
that the map T is well deﬁned as a map from the ball B centered at 0 with radius M into
P. Accordingly, we denote Bi = B ∩ Xi.

For (u, v) ∈ B1 ⊕ B2, we write

T (u, v) = (F1(u, v), F2(u, v)),

23

where Fi’s are maps from B into Xi. We also write ∂uFi, ∂vFi, ... for the partial Fr´echet
derivatives of these maps.

It is clear that for φ = (φ1, φ2) ∈ X1 ⊕ X2

T ′(u, v)φ = (∂uF1(u, v)φ1 + ∂vF1(u, v)φ2, ∂uF2(u, v)φ1 + ∂vF2(u, v)φ2).

For any ﬁxed u ∈ B1 and v ∈ B2, we will think of F1(·, v) and F2(u, ·) as maps from
B1 into X1 and from B2 into X2 respectively. With a slight abuse of the notation, we still
write ∂uF1, ∂vF2 for the Fr´echet derivatives of these maps.

Taking into account of (4.2), we will therefore assume in the sequel that

F2(u, 0) = 0 ∀u ∈ P1.

F2(u, tv) = tZ 1

0

∂vF2(u, tsv)v ds,

(4.6)

(4.7)

This implies

where ∂vF2(u, ·) is the derivative of F2(u, ·) : B2 → X2.

Let Z1 be the set of ﬁxed points of F1(·, 0) in P1 and assume that Z1 6= ∅. Of course,

u ∈ Z1 iﬀ F1(u, 0) = u and F2(u, 0) = 0.

For each u ∈ B1 we consider the spectral radius rv(u) of ∂vF2(u, 0).

rv(u) = lim
k→∞

k∂vF2(u, 0)k1/k

L(X2 ).

We also consider the following subsets of Z1

Z +
1 = {u ∈ Z1 : rv(u) > 1}, Z −

1 = {u ∈ Z1 : rv(u) < 1}.

(4.8)

Roughly speaking, Z +
the P2-direction. Sometimes we simply say that an element in Z +
(resp. v-stable).

1 ) consists of unstable (resp. stable) ﬁxed points of T in
1 ) is v-unstable

1 (resp. Z −

1 (resp. Z −

Let us ﬁx an open neighborhood U of Z1 in P1. We ﬁrst need to show that the index
ind(T, U ⊕ V ) is well deﬁned for some appropriate neighborhood of V 0 in P2, i.e. U ⊕ V
is a neighborhood of Z1 as a subset of P and T has no ﬁxed point on its boundary. To this
end, we will always assume that

Z) If u ∈ Z1 then ∂vF2(u, 0), the Frechet derivative of F2(u, ·) : B2 → X2, does not have a

positive eigenvector to the eigenvalue 1.

In what follows, if G is a map from an open subset W of Pi into Pi and there is no
ambiguity can arise then we will abbreviate ind(G, W, Pi) by ind(G, W ). We also say that
G is a strongly positive endomorphism on W into Xi if G maps W ∩ ˙Pi into ˙Pi).

The following main result of this section shows that ind(T, U ⊕ V ) is determined by the

index of the restriction T |X1, i.e. F1(·, 0), at v-stable ﬁxed points (in Z −

1 ).

Theorem 4.1 Assume Z). There is a neighborhood of V of 0 in P2 such that ind(T, U ⊕ V )
is well deﬁned.

Suppose also the following.

24

i) T is a positive map. That is, T maps B ∩ P into P.

ii) F2(u, 0) = 0 for all u ∈ B1.

iii) At each semi trivial ﬁxed point u ∈ Z1, ∂vF2(u, 0) is a strongly positive map on B2

into X2.

Then there exist two disjoint open sets U +, U − in U such that Z +

1 ⊂ U + and Z −

1 ⊂ U −

and

ind(T, U ⊕ V ) = ind(T, U − ⊕ V ) = ind(F1(·, 0), U −).

Remark 4.2 For u ∈ Z1, i) implies that ∂vF2(u, 0) is a positive endomorphism on X2. In
fact, for any u ∈ Z1, x > 0 and positive small t such that tx ∈ V we have by our assumptions
that F2(u, tx) ≥ 0 and F2(u, 0) = 0. Hence, ∂vF2(u, 0)x = limt→0+ t−1F2(u, tx) ≥ 0. So
that ∂vF2(u, 0) is positive. If certain strong maximum principle for the linear elliptic system
deﬁning ∂vF2(u, 0) is available, see [1, Theorem 4.2], then ∂vF2(u, 0) is strongly positive and
iii) follows. This assumption can be relaxed if Z1 is a singleton (see Remark 4.7).

Remark 4.3 If ∂vF2(u, 0) is strongly positive then rv(u) is the only eigenvalue with pos-
itive eigenfunction. Therefore, the assumptions rv(u) < 1 and rv(u) > 1 are respectively
equivalent to the followings

I’.1) ∂vF2(u, 0) does not have any positive eigenvector to any eigenvalue λ > 1.

I’.2) ∂vF2(u, 0) has a positive eigenvector to some eigenvalue λ > 1.

The proof of Theorem 4.1 will be divided into several lemmas which can be of interest

in themselves.

Our ﬁrst lemma shows that there exists a neighborhood V claimed in Theorem 4.1 such

that ind(T, U ⊕ V ) is well deﬁned.

Lemma 4.4 Assume Z). There is r > 0 such that for V = B(0, r) ∩ P2, the ball in P2
centered at 0 with radius r > 0, there is no ﬁxed point of T (u, v) = (u, v) with v > 0 in the
closure of U ⊕ V in P.

Proof: By contradiction, suppose that there are sequences {rn} of positives rn → 0

and {un} ⊂ U , {vn} ⊂ P2 with kvnk = rn such that, using (4.7)

un = F1(un, vn), vn = F2(un, vn) = Z 1

0

∂vF2(un, svn)vn ds.

Setting wn = vn/kvnk we have

wn = Z 1

0

∂vF2(un, srnwn)wn ds.

By compactness, via a subsequence of {un}, and continuity we can let n → ∞ and
obtain un → u for some u ∈ Z1, vn → 0 and wn → w in X2 such that u = F (u, 0) and
kwk = 1. Hence, w > 0 and satisﬁes

w = Z 1

0

∂vF2(u, 0)w ds = ∂vF2(u, 0)w.

25

Thus, w is a positive eigenvector of ∂vF2(u, 0) to the eigenvalue 1. This is a contradiction
to Z) and completes the proof.

In the sequel, we will always denote by V the neighborhood of 0 in P2 as in the above

lemma.

Our next lemma on the index of T shows that T can be computed by using its restriction

and partial derivatives.

Lemma 4.5 We have

ind(T, U ⊕ V ) = ind(T∗, U ⊕ V ),

where T∗(u, v) = (F1(u, 0), ∂vF2(u, 0)v).

Proof: Consider the following homotopy

H(t, u, v) = (cid:18)F1(u, tv),Z 1

0

∂vF2(u, tsv)v ds(cid:19) for t ∈ [0, 1].

(4.9)

We show that this homotopy is well deﬁned on U ⊕ V . Indeed, if H(t, u, v) has a ﬁxed point
(u, v) on the boundary of U ⊕ V for some t ∈ [0, 1] then

F1(u, tv) = u,

Z 1

0

∂vF2(u, tsv)v ds = v,

(u, v) ∈ ∂(U ⊕ V ).

Assume ﬁrst that t > 0. If v = 0 then the ﬁrst equation gives that F1(u, 0) = u so that
u ∈ Z1. But then (u, 0) /∈ ∂(U ⊕ V ). Thus, v > 0 and the second equation (see (4.7)) yields
F2(u, tv) = tv. This means (u, tv) is a ﬁxed point of T in the closure of U ⊕ V with tv > 0.
But there is no such ﬁxed point of T (u, v) = (u, v) in the closure of U ⊕ V by Lemma 4.4.
Hence, H(t, u, v) cannot have a ﬁxed point (u, v) on the boundary of U ⊕ V if t > 0. We
then consider H(0, u, v) whose ﬁxed points (u, v) ∈ ∂(U ⊕ V ) must satisfy u = F1(u, 0) so
that u ∈ Z1 and ∂vF2(u, 0)v = v with v > 0. But this contradicts Z).

Thus the homotopy is well deﬁned and we have that

ind(T, U ⊕ V ) = ind(H(1, ·), U ⊕ V ) = ind(H(0, ·), U ⊕ V ).

By (4.9), H(0, u, v) = (F1(u, 0), ∂vF2(u, 0)v) = T∗(u, v). The proof is complete.

We now compute ind(T∗, U ⊕ V ).

Lemma 4.6 Assume that ∂vF2(u, 0) is a strongly positive endomorphism on B2 into X2
for each u ∈ Z1. The following holds

I.1) If rv(u) < 1 for any u ∈ Z1 then ind(T∗, U ⊕ V ) = ind(F1(·, 0), U ).

I.2) If rv(u) > 1 for any u ∈ Z1 then ind(T∗, U ⊕ V ) = 0.

Proof: First of all, we see that ∂vF2(u, 0) is a compact map. In fact, we have F2(u, 0) =

0 so that ∂vF2(u, 0)x = limt→0+ t−1F2(u, tx). Since F2 is compact, so is ∂vF2(u, 0).

26

To prove I.1), we consider the following hopmotopy

H(u, v, t) = (F1(u, 0), t∂vF2(u, 0)v),

t ∈ [0, 1].

This homotopy is well deﬁned on U ⊕ V . Indeed, a ﬁxed point of (u, v) of H(·, ·, t) on
∂(U ⊕ V ) must satisﬁes u ∈ Z1 and tv > 0. But this means v > 0 is a positive eigenfunction
to the eigenvalue t−1 ≥ 1. This is a contradiction to Z) and the Krein-Ruthman theorem,
see [1, Theorem 3.2, ii)] for strongly positive compact endomorphism on X2, ∂vF2(u, 0) has
no positive eigenvector diﬀerent from rv(u), which is asumed to be less than 1 in this case.
Thus,

ind(T∗, U ⊕ V ) = ind(H(·, ·, 0), U ⊕ V ).

But H(u, v, 0) = (F1(u, 0), 0) so that, by index product theorem, ind(H(·, ·, 0), U ⊕ V ) =
ind(F1(·, 0), U ). Hence, ind(T∗, U ⊕ V ) = ind(F1(·, 0), U ).

We now consider I.2). Let h be any element in ˙P2, the interior of P2. We ﬁrst consider

the following homotopy

H(u, v, t) = (F1(u, 0), t∂vF2(u, 0)v + th),

t ≥ 1.

(4.10)

If H(·, t) has a ﬁxed point (u, v) in ∂(U ⊕ V ) then u ∈ Z1 and v > 0. Thus, there is
some v∗ > 0 such that v∗ = t∂vF2(u, 0)v∗ + th. This means t−1v∗ − ∂vF2(u, 0)v∗ = h. Since
t−1 ≤ 1 < rv(u), this contradicts the following consequence of the Krein-Rutman theorem
(see [1, Theorem 3.2, iv)] for strongly positive compact operators:

λx − ∂vF2(u, 0)x = h has no positive solution if λ ≤ rv(u).

Thus the homotopy is well deﬁned on U ⊕V . Because ∂vF2(u, 0)v∗ ≥ 0, t∂vF2(u, 0)v∗+th
becomes unbounded as t → ∞, it is clear that H(u, v, t) has no ﬁxed point in U ⊕ V for t
large. We then have ind(H(·, ·, 1), U ⊕ V ) = 0.

We now consider the homotopy

G(u, v, t) = (F1(u, 0), ∂vF2(u, 0)v + th)

t ∈ [0, 1].

We will see that this homotopy is well deﬁned on U ⊕ V if khkX2 is suﬃciently small.
First of all, since ∂vF2(u, 0) is a compact map, the map f (v) = v − ∂vF2(u, 0)v is a closed
map so that f (∂V ) is closed. By Z), if u ∈ Z1 then 0 6∈ f (∂V ) so that there is ε > 0 such
that Bε(0) ∩ f (∂V ) = ∅. This means

kv − ∂vF2(u, 0)vkX2 > ε ∀v ∈ ∂V.

(4.11)

We now take h such that khkX2 < ε/2. If G(·, ·, t) has a ﬁxed point (u, v) ∈ ∂(U ⊕ V )

then u ∈ Z1, v ∈ ∂V and v − ∂vF2(u, 0)v = th. This fact and (4.11) then yield

kv − ∂vF2(u, 0)vkX2 > ε > kthkX2 ∀t ∈ [0, 1].

This means v − ∂vF2(u, 0)v 6= th for all u ∈ Z1, v ∈ ∂V . Hence, the homotopy deﬁned by
G is well deﬁned on U ⊕ V . We then have

ind(T∗, U ⊕ V ) = ind(G(·, ·, 0), U ⊕ V ) = ind(H(·, ·, 1), U ⊕ V ) = 0.

The proof is complete.

Remark 4.7 If we drop the assumption that ∂vF2(u, 0) is strongly positive then the con-
clusion of Lemma 4.6 continues to hold if I.1) is replaced by I’.1), which is essentially used
in the argument. This is also the case, if we assume I’.2) in place of I.2) and Z1 a singleton,
Z1 = {u}. In fact, let h be such a positive eigenvector of ∂vF2(u, 0) for some λu > 1. We
consider the following homotopy.

H(u, v, t) = (F1(u, 0), ∂vF2(u, 0)v + th),

t ≥ 0.

We will show that the homotopy is well deﬁned. The case t = 0 is easy.

Indeed, if
H(·, ·, 0) has a ﬁxed point (u, v) in ∂(U ⊕ V ) then u ∈ Z1 and ∂vF2(u, 0)v = v. But this
gives v = 0, by Z), and u is not in ∂U .

We consider the case t > 0. If H(·, t) has a ﬁx point (u, v) in ∂(U ⊕ V ) then u ∈ Z1 and
v > 0. Thus, there is some v∗ > 0 such that v∗ = ∂vF2(u, 0)v∗ + th. Let τ0 be the maximal
number such that v∗ > τ0h. We then have ∂vF2(u, 0)v∗ ≥ ∂vF2(u, 0)τ0h so that (as λ > 1)

v∗ = ∂vF2(u, 0)v∗ + th ≥ ∂vF2(u, 0)τ0h + th = (λτ0 + t)h > (τ0 + t)h.

Since t > 0, the above contradicts the maximality of τ0. Thus the homotopy is well de-
ﬁned. Again, when t is suﬃciently large H(u, v, t) has no solution in U ⊕ V . Therefore,
ind(H(·, ·, 1), U ⊕ V ) = 0.

Proof of Theorem 4.1: The assumption i) and the regularity results in the previous
section show that T is a compact map on X so that ind(T, O, P) is well deﬁned whenever
T has no ﬁxed point on the boundary of an open set O in P. The assumptions ii) and iii)
allow us to make use of the lemmas in this section.

We ﬁrst prove that rv(u) is continuous in u ∈ Z1 (see also Remark 4.8). Let {un} ⊂ Z1 be
a sequence converging to some u∗ ∈ Z1. Accordingly, let hn be the normalized eigenfunction
(khnk = 1) to the eigenvalue λn = rv(un). Because k∂vF2(un, 0)kL(X2) is bounded for all
n, we see that {λn} is bounded from the deﬁnition of the spectral radius. Let {λnk } be
a convergent subsequence of {λn} converges to some λ. The regularity of elliptic systems
yields that the corresponding eigenfunction sequence {hnk} has a convergent subsequence
converges to a solution h > 0 of the eigenvalue problem ∂vF2(u∗, 0)h = λh. By uniqueness
of the positive eigenfunction (see [1, Theorem 3.2, ii)]), λ = rv(u∗). We now see that all
convergent subsequences of {λn} converge to rv(u∗). Thus, lim sup λn = lim inf λn and
λn = rv(un) → rv(u∗) as n → ∞. Hence, rv(u) is continuous in u ∈ Z1.

Therefore, Z +

1 , Z −

1 are disjoint open sets in Z1. By Z), their union is the compact set
Z1 so that they are also closed in Z1 and compact in X1. Hence, there are disjoint open
sets U +, U − in X1 such that Z1+ ⊂ U +, Z −

1 ⊂ U −. We then have

ind(T∗, U ⊕ V ) = ind(T∗, (U + ∪ U −) ⊕ V ) = ind(T∗, U + ⊕ V ) + ind(T∗, U − ⊕ V ).

Applying case I.2) of Lemma 4.6 for U = U +, we see that ind(T∗, U + ⊕ V ) is zero. It

follows that

ind(T∗, U ⊕ V ) = ind(T∗, U − ⊕ V ) = ind(F1(·, 0), U −).

By Lemma 4.5, ind(T, U ⊕ V ) = ind(T∗, U ⊕ V ), the theorem then follows.

28

Remark 4.8 The strong positiveness of ∂vF2 is essential in several places of our proof.
Under this assumption, we provided a simple proof of the continuity of rv(u) on Z1. In
general, as ∂vF2 is always compact, the continuity of rv(u) follows from [3, Theorem 2.1],
where it was proved that the spectral radius is continuous on the subspace of compact
operators.

We end this section by the following well known result which is a special case of Theo-

rem 4.1.

Corollary 4.9 Let X be a Banach space with positive cone P and F is a postive compact
map on P . Suppose that F (0) = 0 and the directional Frec´et derivative F ′
+(0) exists (i.e.
+(0)x = limt→0+ t−1F (tx)). Assume also that F ′
F ′
+(0) does not have any positive eigenvector
to the eigenvalue 1 and that the following holds.

F ′

+(0) does not have any positive eigenvector to any eigenvalue λ > 1.

(4.12)

Then we can ﬁnd a neighborhood V of 0 in P such that 0 is the only ﬁxed point of F in V
and

ind(F, V ) = ( 1 if (4.12) holds,

0 otherwise.

(4.13)

To see this, we let X = {0} ⊕ X, i.e. X1 = {0} and X2 = X, and T (·) = (0, F (·)).
Obviously, Theorem 4.1, with F1 is the constant map and F2 = F , Z1 being the singleton
{0} (see Remark 4.7) and U = {0}, provides a neighborhood U − of Z −
1 in X1 such that
ind(T, {0}⊕V ) = ind(0, U −). Clearly, as F1 is a constant map, if (4.12) holds then U − = {0}
and ind(F1(·, 0), U −) = 1; otherwise U − = ∅ and ind(F1(·, 0), U −) = 0. By the product
theorem of indices, ind(T, {0} ⊕ V ) = ind(F, V ), (4.13) then follows.

4.2 Applications

In this section, we will show that the abstract results on the local indices of T at trivial and
semi trivial solutions in Theorem 4.1 can apply to the map T deﬁned by (4.1) satisfying a
suitable set of assumptions.

Going back to the deﬁnition of T , for each (u, v) ∈ X and some suitable constant matrix

K we consider the following linear elliptic system for w = T (u, v).

( −div(A(u, v)Dw) + Kw = ˆf (u, v) + K(u, v)

Homogenenous boundary conditions for w

in Ω,
on ∂Ω .

(4.14)

Remark 4.10 We observe that the choice of the matrix K is not important here as long as
the map T is well deﬁned (as a positive map). In fact, let K1, K2 be two diﬀerent matrices
and T1, T2 be the corresponding maps deﬁned by (4.14). It is clear that these maps have
the same set of ﬁxed points consisting of solutions to (4.1). Hence, via a simple homotopy
tT1 + (1 − t)T2 for t ∈ [0, 1], the indices ind(Ti, U ) are equal whenever one of their indices
is deﬁned (i.e. (4.1) does not have any solution on ∂U ).

29

Trivial solution: It is clear that 0 is a solution if ˆf (0) = 0. In this case, we can apply

Corollary 4.9 with F = T . The eigenvalue problem of T ′(0)h = λh now is

− div(A(0)Dh) + Kh = λ−1( ˆfu(0) + K)h.

(4.15)

We then have the following result from Corollary 4.9.

Lemma 4.11 There is a neighborhood V0 of 0 in P such that if (4.15) has a positive solution
h to some eigenvalue λ > 1 then ind(T, V0) = 0. Otherwise, ind(T, V0) = 1.

Semitrivial solution: By reordering the equations and variables, we will write an

element of X as (u, v) and

A(u, v) = " P (u)(u, v) P (v)(u, v)

Q(u)(u, v) Q(v)(u, v) # and ˆf (u, v) = " f (u)(u, v)

f (v)(u, v) # .

The existence of semitrivial solutions (u, 0) usually comes from the assumption that

Q(u)(u, 0) = 0 and f (v)(u, 0) = 0 ∀u ∈ X1.

(4.16)

If (4.16) holds then it is clear that (u, 0) is a solution of (4.1) if and only if u solves the

following subsystem

− div(P (u)(u, 0)Du) = f (u)(u, 0).

(4.17)

Let us then assume that the set Z1 of positive solutions to (4.17) is nonempty.
To compute the local index of T at a semi trivial solution we consider the following

matrix

K = " K (u)

1 K (v)
0 K (v)

# ,

(4.18)

where the matrices K (u)

We will consider the following assumptions on the above subsystems.

K.0) Assume that there are k1, k2 > 0 such that

hK (u)

( −div(A(u, v)Dw) + Kw ≥ 0

Homogenenous boundary conditions on ∂Ω

in Ω,

then w ≥ 0.

K.2) For any u ∈ Z1 and φ2 ∈ ˙P2 a strong maximum principle holds for the system

v (u, 0)Duφ2 in K.2) we have used the following notation:

For u ∈ Z1 we will also consider the following eigenvalue problem for an eigenfunction h

The main theorem of this subsection is the following.

Theorem 4.12 Assume K.0)-K.4) with k1 in K.0) being suﬃciently large. Then the map T
described in (4.14) is well deﬁned on B∩P and maps B∩X into P. There are neighborhoods
U, U − respectively of Z1, Z −

1 in P1 and a neighborhood V on 0 in P2 such that

ind(T, U ⊕ V ) = ind(F1(·, 0), U −).

Here, F1(·, 0) maps B ∩ P1 into P1 and w1 = F1(u, 0), u ∈ B ∩ P1, is the unique solution
to

(4.25)

The above theorem is just a consequence of Theorem 4.1 applying to the system (4.14).
We need only to verify the assumption of the theorem. For this purpose and later use in
the section we will divide its proof into lemmas which also contain additional and useful
facts.

We ﬁrst have the following lemma which shows that the assumption (4.6), that F2(u, 0) =

0 for all u ∈ X1, in the previous section is satisﬁed.

Lemma 4.13 Let T be deﬁned by (4.14). If K.0) holds for some suﬃciently large k1 then
T is well deﬁned by (4.14) for any given matrix K (v)
1 . The components F1, F2 of T satisfy

i) F2(u, 0) = 0 for all u ∈ X1.

ii) w1 = F1(u, 0) solves (4.25). In addition, ind(F1(·, 0), B ∩ P1) = 1.

Proof: We write w = T (u, v) = (F1(u, v), F2(u, v)) in (4.14) by (w1, w2), with wi ∈ Xi.

Because

hKw, wi = hK (u)

1 w1, w1i + hK (v)

1 w2, w1i + hK (v)

2 w2, w2i,

a simple use of Young’s inequality and (4.21) show that if k1 suﬃciently large then hKx, xi ≥
|x|2 for any given K (v)

1 ,. Hence, T is well deﬁned by (4.14).

At (u, 0), since ˆf (v)(u, 0) = 0 and Q(u)(u, 0) = 0, the subsystem (4.20) deﬁning w2 =

F2(u, 0) now is

−div(Q(v)(u, 0)Dw2) + K (v)

2 w2 = 0.

This system has w2 = 0 as the only solution because of the assumption (4.21) on K (v)
2
the ellipticity of Q(v)(u, 0). This gives i).

and

Next, as w2 and Dw2 are zero, (4.19) gives that w1 = F1(u, 0) solves

−div(P (u)(u, 0)Dw1) + K (u)

1 w1 = f (u)(u, 0) + K (u)

1 u.

Again, for a given u ∈ X1 this subsystem has a unique solution w1 if hK (u)
for some k1 > 0. Moreover, the ﬁxed point of u = F1(u, 0) solves

1 x, xi ≥ k1|x|2

−div(P (u)(u, 0)Du) = f (u)(u, 0).

This system satisﬁes the same set of structural conditions for the full system (4.1) so that
Theorem 3.2 can apply here to give ii).

From the proof of Theorem 4.1 we need study the Frechet (directional) derivative of T
deﬁned by (4.14). For this purpose and later use, we consider a more general linear system
deﬁning w = T (u)

( −div(A(u)Dw + B(u, Du)w) + C(u, Du)w = ˆf (u, Du) x ∈ Ω,

w = 0 on ∂Ω,

(4.26)

for some matrix valued functions A, B, C, ˆf .

We then recall the following elementary result on the linearization of the above system

at u.

32

Lemma 4.14 Let u, φ be in X. If w = T (u) is deﬁned by (4.26) then W = T ′(u)φ solves
the following system

−div(A(u)DW + B(u, Du)W + B(u, w, φ)) + C(u, W, w, φ) = F(u, φ),

where

B(u, w, φ) = Au(u)φDw + Bu(u, Du)φw + Bζ(u, Du)Dφw,

C(u, W, w, φ) = C(u, Du)W + Cu(u, Du)φw + Cζ(u, Du)Dφw,

F(u, φ) = ˆfu(u, Du)φ + ˆfζ(u, Du)Dφ.

The proof of this lemma is standard. Because A, ˆf are C 1 in u, it is easy to see that T
is diﬀerentiable. In fact, for any u, φ ∈ X we can compute T ′(u)φ = limh→0 δh,φT (u), where
δh,φ is the diﬀerence quotient operator

δh,φT (u) = h−1(T (u + hφ) − T (u)).

Subtracting (4.3) at u being u + hφ and u and dividing the result by h, we get

−div(δh,φ[A(u)DT (u) + B(u, Du)T (u)])+

δh,φ[C(u, Du)T (u)] = δh,φ ˆf (u, Du).

(4.27)

It is elementary to see that if g is a C 1 function in u, ζ = Du, w = T (u), Dw then

δh,φg(u, Du, w, Dw) = guφ + gζDφ + gwT ′(u)φ + gDwD(T ′(u)φ).

lim
h→0

Using the above in (4.27) and rearranging the terms, we obtain the lemma.
Applying Lemma 4.14 to the system (4.20), we have the following lemma concerning

the map ∂vF2(u, 0) at u ∈ Z1.

Lemma 4.15 Let u ∈ Z1. An eigenvector function h of ∂vF2(u, 0)h = λh satisﬁes the
system

− div(λQ(v)(u, 0)Dh + Q(u)

v (u, 0)Duh) + λK (v)

2 h = f (v)

(u, 0)h + K (v)

2 h.

(4.28)

v

In addition, if K.2) holds then ∂vF2(u, 0) is strongly positive.

Proof: Let φ = (0, φ2) and u ∈ Z1. We have

w := T (u, 0), W := T ′(u, 0)φ = (∂vF1(u, 0)φ2, ∂vF2(u, 0)φ2)

satisfy, by Lemma 4.14 with B(u, Du) = 0 and C(u, Du) = K

−div(A(u, 0)DW + ∂u,vA(u, 0)φDw) + KW = ˆfu,v(u, 0)φ + Kφ.

At (u, 0), we have that v, Dv are zero and Dw = D(T (u, 0)) = (Du, 0) so that

A(u, 0) =" P (u)(u, 0) P (v)(u, 0)

Q(v)(u, 0) # ,

33

∂u,vA(u, 0)φDw = " P (u)

v
Q(u)

(u, 0)Duφ2

v (u, 0)Duφ2 # .

Thus, U1 := ∂vF1(u, 0)φ2 and U2 := ∂vF2(u, 0)φ2, the components of T ′(u, 0)φ, satisfy

−div(P (u)(u, 0)DU1 + P (v)(u, 0)DU2 + P (u)

v (u, 0)Duφ2) + K (v)

2 U2 = f (v)

v

(u, 0)φ2 + K (v)

2 φ2.

(4.29)

We consider the eigenvalue problem ∂vF2(u, 0)h = λh. Set φ2 = h then U2 = λh and it

is clear from (4.29) that h is the solution to (4.28).

Finally, the system (4.29) deﬁning U2 := ∂vF2(u, 0)φ2) is exactly (4.22) in K.2). Thus,

the strong maximum principle for (4.22) yields that ∂vF2(u, 0) is strongly positive.

Proof of Theorem 4.12: Lemma 4.13 shows that T is well deﬁned and maps B∩P into
P if K.1) is assumed. Lemma 4.15 and K.2) then gives the strong positivity of ∂vF2(u, 0)
for any u ∈ Z1. In addition, the equation in the condition K.3) is (4.28) of Lemma 4.15
when λ = 1 so that K.3) means that the condition Z) of the previous section holds here.
Thus, our theorem is just a consequence of Theorem 4.1.

We now turn to semi trivial ﬁxed points of T in X2. These ﬁxed points are determined

by the following system, setting w1 = u = 0, w2 = v in (4.19) and (4.20)

( −div(P (v)(0, v)Dv) = f (u)(0, v),

−div(Q(v)(0, v)Dv) = f (v)(0, v).

(4.30)

We will assume that this system has no positive solution v. In fact, if P (v)(0, v) 6= 0 the
above system is overdetermined so that the existence of a nonzero solution v of the second
subsystem satisfying the ﬁrst subsystem is very unlikely. In fact, assuming f (v)(0, 0) = 0,
it could happen that the second subsystem already has v = 0 as the only solution.

At (u, v) = (0, 0), the eigenvalue problem ∂vF2(0, 0)h2 = λh2 for h2 ∈ X2 is

− div(Q(v)(0, 0)Dh2) + K (v)

2 h2 = λ−1(f (v)

v

(0, 0) + K (v)

2 )h2.

(4.31)

From ii) of Lemma 4.13, the eigenvalue problem ∂uF1(0, 0)h1 = λh1 for h1 ∈ X1 is

− div(P (u)(0, 0)Dh1) + K (u)

1 h1 = λ−1(f (u)

u (0, 0) + K (u)

1

)h1.

(4.32)

Again, we will say that 0 ∈ X1 is u-stable if the above has no positive eigenvector h1 to any
eigenvalue λ > 1. Otherwise, we say that 0 is u-unstable.

Our ﬁrst application of Theorem 4.1 is to give suﬃcient conditions such that semi trivial

and nontrivial solutions exist.

34

Theorem 4.16 Suppose that (4.30) has no positive solution. Assume K.0)-K.4) and that
the system

− div(P (u)(0, 0)Dh1) = f (u)

u (0, 0)h1 has no solution h1 ∈ ˙P1.

(4.33)

If either one of the followings holds

i.1) 0 is u-stable and Z +

1 = {0};

i.2) 0 is u-unstable and Z −

1 = {0};

then there is a nontrivial positive solution to (4.1).

Proof: We denote Zp = {u ∈ Z1 : u > 0}. Thus Zp is the set of semi trivial solutions
and Z1 = {0}∪Zp. Accordingly, we denote by Z +
p ) the v-unstable (resp. v-stable)
subset of Zp. The assumption (4.33) means ∂uF1(0, 0) does not have positive eigenfunction
to the eigenvalue 1 in P1. Applying Corollary 4.9 with X = X1 and F (·) = F1(·, 0), we can
ﬁnd a neighborhood U0 in X1 of 0 such that 0 is the only ﬁxed point of F1(·, 0) in U0 and
(4.13) gives

p (resp. Z −

ind(F1(·, 0), U0) = ( 1 if 0 is u-stable,

0 if 0 is u-unstable.

(4.34)

Since Z1 is compact and Z1 = {0} ∪ Zp, the above argument shows that Zp is compact.
p and U +
p in X1
p are disjoint so

From the proof of Theorem 4.1, there are disjoint open neighborhoods U −
p and U +
of Z −
that for U = U0 ∪ U +

p respectively. Of course, we can assume that U0, U −

p and Z +

p ∪ U −
p

ind(F1(·, 0), U ) = ind(F1(·, 0), U0) + ind(F1(·, 0), U +

p ) + ind(F1(·, 0), U −

p ).

(4.35)

p = ∅ and U − = U −
p

p = ∅ and we can take U +

By Lemma 4.13, ind(F1(·, 0), B ∩ P1) = 1. This implies ind(F1(·, 0), U ) = 1.

ind(F1(·, 0), U0) = 1 so that (4.35) implies ind(F1(·, 0), U −
1 = {0} and Z −

holds then Z +
(4.34),
ind(F1(·, 0), U −) = 0. Similarly, If i.2) holds then Z −
U −

If i.1)
in Theorem 4.1. From
p ) = 0. This yields
p = ∅ and we can take
p = ∅ and U − = U0 in Theorem 4.1. From (4.35), ind(F1(·, 0), U −) = ind(F1(·, 0), U0) = 0.
Hence, ind(F1(·, 0), U −) = 0 in both cases. By Theorem 4.12, we ﬁnd a neighborhood
V of 0 in P2 such that ind(T, U ⊕ V ) = ind(F1(·, 0), U −) = 0. Since ind(T, B ∩ X) = 1,
we see that T has a ﬁxed point in B \ U ⊕ V . This ﬁxed point is nontrivial because we are
assuming that T has no semi trivial ﬁxed point in P2.

4.3 Notes on a more special case and a diﬀerent way to deﬁne T :

In many applications, it is reasonable to assume that the cross diﬀusion eﬀects by other
components should be proportional to the density of a given component. This is to say that
if A(u) = (aij(u)) then there are smooth functions bij such that

aij(u) = uibij(u)

if j 6= i.

(4.36)

35

In this case, instead of using (4.14), we can deﬁne the i-th component wi of T (u) by

Li(u)wi +Xj

kijwj = fi(u) +Xj

kijuj,

(4.37)

where

Li(u)w = −div(aii(u)Dw + w(Xj6=i

bij(u)Duj)).

(4.38)

As u ∈ B ∩ P, (4.37) is a weakly coupled system with H¨older continuous coeﬃcients.
We will see that the condition K.1) on the positivity of solutions in the previous section
is veriﬁed. To this end, we recall the maximum principles for cooperative linear systems
in [19, 20] and give here an alternative and simple proof to [19, Theorem 1.1].
In fact,
we consider a more general setting that covers both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
conditions.

Let us deﬁne

(4.39)
where αi ∈ L∞(Ω), βi ∈ L∞(Ω, IRn). Denote F = (F1, · · · , Fm). We then have the following
weak minimum principle.

Liw = −div(αi(x)Dw + βi(x)w),

Lemma 4.17 Let w be a weak solution to the system

( Liwi + Kw = Fi,

i = 1, . . . , m, in Ω,

Homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on ∂Ω.

Assume that αi(x) ≥ λi for some λi > 0 and Fi ≥ 0 for all i. If kij ≤ 0 for i 6= j and kii
are suﬃciently large, in terms of supΩ βi(u(x)), then w ≥ 0.

i.e. hγx, xi ≥ c|x|2 for some positive c. Thus, (4.41) forces w−

i = 0 a.e. and w ≥ 0.

Thanks to this lemma, we now see how to construct a matrix K such that T maps B∩ P

into P. To this end, we note thatf (u)(0, 0) = 0 and f (v)(u, 0) = 0 so that we can write

Since k ˆfu(u)kX is bounded for u ∈ B = B(0, M ) (the bound M is independent of K),
ˆfj ≥ 0 for i 6= j, then we
it is not diﬃcult to see that if the reaction is ’cooperative’, i.e., ∂ui
can always ﬁnd K with kij = 0 for i 6= j and kii > 0 suﬃciently large such that the matrix
integrands in the above equations are all positive. Therefore, F := ˆf (u, v) + K(u, v) ≥ 0
for (u, v) ∈ B ∩ P and the lemma can apply here.

Finally, for future use in the next section we now explicitly describe the map T ′(u) in
this case. For Φ = (φ1, . . . , φm), by Lemma 4.14, the components wi = Ti(u) of T (u) and
Wi = T ′

5 Nonconstant and Nontrivial Solutions

We devote this section to the study of (4.1) with Neumann boundary conditions. The-
orem 4.16 gives the existence of positive nontrivial solution but this solution may be a
constant solution. This is the case when there is a constant vector u∗ = (u∗
m) such
that f (u∗) = 0. Obviously u = u∗ is a nontrivial solution to (4.1) and Theorem 4.16 then
yields no useful information. In applications, we are interested in ﬁnding a nonconstant
solution besides this obvious solution. We will assume throughout this section that the
semi trivial solutions are all constant and show that cross diﬀusion will play an important
role for the existence of nonconstant and nontrivial solutions.

1, . . . , u∗

Inspired by the SKT systems, we assume that the diﬀusion is given by (4.36) as in
Section 4.3 and the reaction term in the i-th equation is also proportional to the density
ui. This means,

fi(u) = uigi(u)

(5.1)

for some C 1 functions gi’s. A constant solution u∗ exists if it is a solution to the equations
gi(u∗) = 0 for all i.

Throughout this section, we denote by ψi’s the eigenfunctions of −∆, satisfying Neu-
mann boundary condition, to the eigenvalue ˆλi such that {ψi} is a basis for W 1,2(Ω). That
is,

( −∆ψ = ˆλiψ in Ω,

ψ satisﬁes homogeneous Neumann boundary condition.

5.1 Semi trivial constant solutions

We consider a semi trivial solution (u, 0) with u = (u1, . . . , um1) for some integer m1 =
0, . . . , m. Following the analysis of Section 4.1, we need to consider the eigenvalue problem

38

∂vF2(u, 0)Φ2 = µΦ2 with Φ2 = (φm1 , . . . , φm) and Φ = (0, Φ2). Then the equation (4.45),
with Wi = µφi for i = m1 + 1, . . . , m, gives

−div(aii(u, 0)Dφi + Xj≤m1

bij(u, 0)Duj φi) + Xj>m1

kijφj = µ−1 Xj>m1

(∂uj fi(u, 0) + kij)φj.

If u is a constant vector then Duj = 0 and the above reduces to

− div(aii(u, 0)Dφi) + Xj>m1

kijφj = µ−1 Xj>m1

(∂uj fi(u, 0) + kij)φj,

(5.2)

which is an elliptic system with constant coeﬃcients. We then need the following lemma.

Lemma 5.1 Let A, B be constant matrices. Then the solution space of the problem

( −div(ADΦ) = BΦ,

Neumann boundary conditions.

has a basis {ci,jψi} where ci,j’s are the basis vectors of Ker(ˆλiA − B).

The proof of this lemma is elementary. If Φ solves its equation of the lemma then we can

write Φ = P kiψi, in W 1,2(Ω), with ki ∈ IRm. We then have Pi

{ψi} is a basis of W 1,2(Ω), this equation implies ˆλiAki = Bki for all i. Thus, ki is a linear
combination of ci,j’s. It is easy to see that {ci,jψj} is linearly independent if {ci,j}, {ψj }
are. The lemma then follows.

ˆλiAkiψi = Pi Bkiψi. Since

Lemma 5.2 Let m1 be a nonnegative integer less than m and u = (u1, . . . , um1) be a
constant function such that T (u, 0) = (u, 0). Then

∂vf (v)(u, 0)c = λK (v)
2 c

has a positive eigenvector c to a positive (respectively, negative) eigenvalue λ if and only
if the eigenvalue problem ∂vF2(u, 0)Φ2 = µΦ2 has a positive solution for some µ > 1
(respectively, µ < 1).

Proof: By (5.2) , the eigenvalue problem ∂vF2(u, 0)Φ2 = µΦ2 (or Wi = µφi) is deter-

mined by the following system

− µdiv(A(m1)(u, 0)DΦ2) + µK (v)

2 Φ2 = [∂vf (v)(u, 0) + K (v)

2 ]Φ2,

(5.3)

where A(m1)(u, 0) = diag[aii(u, 0)]i>m1 . The coeﬃcients of the above system are constant

and Lemma 5.1 yields that the solutions to the above is P ciψi with ci solving

µ[ˆλiA(m1)(u, 0) + K (v)

2 ]c = [∂vf (v)(u, 0) + K (v)

2 ]c.

Note that the only positive eigenfunction of −∆ is ψ0 = 1 to the eigenvalue ˆλ0 = 0.

Therefore, from the above system with i = 0 we see that if the system

µK (v)

2 c = [∂vf (v)(u, 0) + K (v)

2 ]c ⇔ ∂vf (v)(u, 0)c = (µ − 1)K (v)
2 c

39

has a positive solution c then the constant function c is a positive eigenfunction for ∂vF2(u, 0).
Conversely, if ∂vF2(u, 0)Φ2 = µΦ2 has a positive solution Φ2 then we integrate (5.3) over
Φ2 dx is a positive solution

Ω, using the Neumann boundary conditions, to see that c =ZΩ

to the above system. The lemma then follows.

Remark 5.3 By the Krein-Ruthman theorem, if ∂vF2(u, 0) is strongly positive then µ =
rv(u) is the only eigenvalue with positive eigenvector. The eigenvalue problem ∂vF2(u, 0)Φ2 =
µΦ2 has a positive solution for µ = 1 if and only if the matrix ∂vf (v)(u, 0) has a positive
eigenvector to the zero eigenvalue.

We now discuss the special case fi(u) = uigi(u).

Lemma 5.4 Assume that fi(u) = uigi(u). Let m1 be a nonnegative integer less than m
and u = (u1, . . . , um1 ) be a constant vector such that T (u, 0) = (u, 0). Then the eigenvalue
problem ∂vF2(u, 0)Φ2 = µΦ2

i.1) has no nonzero solution for µ = 1 if and only if gi(u, 0) 6= 0 for any i > m1;

i.2) has a positive solution for some µ > 1 if and only if gi(u, 0) > 0 for some i > m1;

i.3) has no positive solution for µ > 1 if and only gi(u, 0) < 0 for any i > m1.

Proof: We now let K = kI. By Lemma 5.2 the existence of positive eigenvectors of

∂vF2(u, 0)Φ2 = µΦ2 is equivalent to that of

∂vf (v)(u, 0)c = kλc with c = (cm1+1, . . . , cm) > 0 and λ = µ − 1.

(5.4)

Since fi(u) = uigi(u) and ui = 0 for i > m1, we have ∂uk fi(u, 0) = δikgi(u, 0), where δik
is the Kronecker symbol, for i, k > m1. Thus, ∂vf (v)(u, 0) is a diagonal matrix and (5.4) is
simply

gi(u, 0)ci = kλci ∀i > m1.

Clearly i.1) holds because then the above system has nonzero eigenvector to λ = 0. For
i.2) we can take λ = gi(u, 0)/k > 0 and ci = 1, other components of c can be zero. i.3) is
obvious. The proof is complete.

We then have the following theorem for systems of two equations.

Theorem 5.5 Assume that fi(u) = uigi(u) for i ∈ {1, 2}. Suppose that the trivial and
semi trivial solutions are only the constant ones (0, 0), u1,∗ and u2,∗. This means, gi(ui,∗) =
0.Then there is a nontrivial solution (u1, u2) > 0 in the following situations:

a) gi(0) > 0, i = 1, 2, and g1(u2,∗) and g2(u1,∗) are positive.

b) gi(0) > 0, i = 1, 2, and g1(u2,∗) and g2(u1,∗) are negative.

c) g1(0) > 0, g2(0) < 0, and g2(u1,∗) > 0.

40

Proof: We just need to compute the local indices of T at the trivial and semi trivial

solutions and show that the sum of these indices is not 1.

First of all, by i.1) of Lemma 5.4, it is clear that the condition Z) at these solutions are

satisﬁed in the above situations.

The conditions in case a) and i.2) of Lemma 5.4 imply that 0 and the semi trivial
solutions are unstable in theirs complement directions. Theorem 4.12, with Z −
1 = ∅, gives
that the local indices at these solutions are all zero. Similarly, in case b), the local index at 0
is 0 and the local indices at the semi trivial solutions, which are stable in theirs complement
directions, are 1. In these cases, the sum of the indices is either 0 or 2.

In case c), because g2(0) < 0 we see that 0 is u2-stable so that T2 := T |X2, the restriction
of the map T to X2, has its local index at 0 equal 1 and therefore its local index at u2,∗ is zero
(see also the proof of Theorem 4.16). The assumption g1(0) > 0 also yields a neighborhood
V1 in X1 of 0 such that ind(T, V1 ⊕ X2) = 0 (the stability of u2,∗ in the u1 direction does
not matter). On the other hand, because g1(0) > 0 we see that 0 is u1-unstable so that
T1 := T |X1, the restriction of the map T to X1, has its local index at 0 equal 0 and therefore
its local index at u1,∗ is 1. But u1,∗ is u2-unstable, because g2(u1,∗) > 0, so that there is a
neighborhood V2 in X2 of 0 such that ind(T, X1 ⊕ V2) = 0.

In three cases, we have shown that the sum of the local indices at the trivial and semi

trivial solutions is not 1. Hence, there is a positive nontrivial ﬁxed point (u1, u2).

Remark 5.6 If the system gi(u) = 0, i = 1, 2, has no positive constant solution then the
above theorem gives conditions for the existence of nonconstant and nontrivial solutions.
This means pattern formations occur.

5.2 Nontrivial constant solutions

Suppose now that u∗ = (u1, . . . , um) is a nontrivial constant ﬁxed point of T with ui 6= 0 for
all i. We will use the Leray Schauder theorem to compute the local index of T at u∗. Since
u∗ is in the interior of P, we do not need that T is positive as in the previous discussion so
that we can take K = 0. The main result of this section, Theorem 5.8, yields a formula to
compute the indices at nontrivial constant ﬁxed points. In applications, the sum of these
indices and those at semi trivial ﬁxed points will shows the possibility of nontrivial and
nonconstant ﬁxed points to exist.

In the sequel, we will denote

dA(u∗) = diag[a11(u∗), . . . , amm(u∗)].

(5.5)

From the ellipticity assumption on A, we easily see that aii(u∗) > 0 for all i and thus dA(u∗)
is invertible.

The following lemma describes the eigenspaces of T ′(u∗).

Lemma 5.7 The solution space of T ′(u∗)Φ = µΦ is spanned by ciψi with ci solving

ˆλi[A(u∗) + (µ − 1)dA(u∗)]ci = ∂uF (u∗)ci.

(5.6)

41

Proof: We have D(T (u∗)) = Du∗ = 0 so that (4.42)-(4.44), with w = u∗, show that

the i-th component Wi of T ′(u∗)Φ solves

−div(aii(u∗)DWi + wiXj6=i

bij(u∗)Dφj) = ∂uk fi(u∗)φk.

Since wibij(u∗) = uibij(u∗) = aij(u∗), the eigenvalue problem W = T ′(u∗)Φ = µΦ is

−div(aii(u∗)D(µφi) +Xj6=i

aij(u∗)Dφj) = ∂uk fi(u∗)φk.

In matrix form, the above can be written as

− div([A(u∗) + (µ − 1)dA(u∗)]DΦ) = ∂uF (u∗)Φ.

(5.7)

Since u∗ is a constant vector, by Lemma 5.1 we can write Φ = P ciψi with ci solving

ˆλi[A(u∗) + (µ − 1)dA(u∗)]ci = ∂uF (u∗)ci ∀i.

This is (5.6) and the lemma is proved.

We now have the following explicit formula for ind(T, u∗).

Theorem 5.8 Assume that

Ker(ˆλiA(u∗) − ∂uF (u∗)) = {0} ∀i.

(5.8)

For i > 0 let Ai = A(u∗) − ˆλ−1

i ∂uF (u∗) and

dim(Ker(dA(u∗)−1Ai − λI)).

Ni = Xλ<0

We also denote by Mi the multiplicity of ˆλi.
Then there exists an integer L0 such that

ind(T, u∗) = (−1)γ ,

NiMi.

γ = Xi≤L0

(5.9)

Proof: We will apply Leray-Schauder’s theorem to compute ind(T, u∗). First of all,
Lemma 5.7 and (5.8) show that Φ = 0 is the only solution to T ′(u∗)Φ = Φ so that µ = 1 is
not an eigenvalue of T ′(u∗).

By Leray-Schauder’s theorem, we have that ind(T, u∗) = (−1)γ, where γ is the sum of
multiplicities of eigenvalues µ of T ′(u∗) which are greater than 1. Lemma 5.7 then clearly
shows that γ is the sum of the dimensions of solution spaces of (5.6) and

γ∗
i Mi,

γ := Xi

(5.10)

and γ∗

i = Pµ>1 ni,µ, where ni,µ is the dimension of the solution space of

ˆλi[A(u∗) + (µ − 1)dA(u∗)]c − ∂uF (u∗)c = 0.

42

For i = 0 we have ˆλ0 = 0 so that n0,µ = dim(Ker(∂uF (u∗))), which is zero because of
(5.8). For i > 0 and µ > 1 let Ai = A(u∗) − ˆλ−1
i ∂uF (u∗), as being deﬁned in this theorem,
and λ = 1 − µ < 0. The above equation can be rewritten as Aic = λdA(u∗)c so that c
is an eigenvector to a negative eigenvalue λ of the matrix dA(u∗)−1Ai. It is clear that the
i in (5.10) is the sum of the dimensions of eigenspaces of dA(u∗)−1Ai to negative
number γ∗
eigenvalues. That is γ∗

i = Ni.

From the ellipticity assumption on A, it is not diﬃcult to see that dA(u∗)−1A(u∗) is
positive deﬁnite. Therefore, dA(u∗)−1Ai is positive if ˆλi is large. Thus, as limi→∞ ˆλi = ∞,
there is an integer L0 such that dA(u∗)−1Ai has no negative eigenvalues if i > L0. Hence,
γ∗
i = Ni = 0 if i > L0. The theorem then follows.

Remark 5.9 Since ˆλ0 = 0, (5.8) implies that Ker(∂uF (u∗)) = {0} so that u∗ is an isolated
constant solution to F (u∗) = 0. Also, as A(u∗) is positive deﬁnite and limi→∞ ˆλi = ∞, we
see that (5.8) is true when i is large.

Combining Theorem 5.8 and Theorem 5.5, we obtain

Corollary 5.10 Assume as in Theorem 5.5. Suppose further that there is only one non-
trivial constant solution u∗. Let γ be as in (5.9). There is a nontrivial nonconstant solution
(u1, u2) > 0 in the following situations:

1) γ is odd and a) or c) of the theorem hold.

2) γ is even and b) of the theorem holds.

Proof: We have seen from the proof of Theorem 5.5 that the sum of the local indices
at the trivial and semi trivial solutions is 0 in the cases a) and c).
If γ is odd then
ind(T, u∗) = −1. Similarly, if b) holds then the sum of the indices at the trivial and
semi trivial solutions is 2.
If γ is even then ind(T, u∗) = 1. Thus, the sum of the local
indices at constant solutions is not 1 in both cases. Since ind(T, B ∩ X) = 1, a nonconstant
and nontrivial solution must exist.

5.3 Some nonexistent results

We conclude this paper by some nonexistence results showing that if the parameter λ0 is
suﬃciently large then there is no nonconstant solutions. We consider the following system

( −div(A(u, Du) = f (u) + B(u, Du)

homogenenous Neumann boundary conditions on ∂Ω,

in Ω,

(5.11)

We ﬁrst have the following nonexistent result under a strong assumption on the uniform

boundedness of solutions. This assumption will be relaxed later in Corollary 5.13.

Theorem 5.11 Assume that A satisﬁes A) and ˆf (u, Du) := f (u) + B(u, Du) for some f ∈
C 1(IRm, IRm) and B : IRm × IRmn → IRm such that |B(u, p)| ≤ b(u)|p| for some continuous

43

nonnegative function b on IRm. Suppose also that there is a constant C independent of λ0
such that for any solutions of (5.11)

kukL∞(Ω) ≤ C.

If the constant λ0 in A) is suﬃciently large then there is no nonconstant solution to (5.11).

Proof: For any function g on Ω let us denote the average of g over Ω by gΩ. That is,

gΩ =

1

|Ω|ZΩ

g dx.

Integrating (5.11) and using Neumann boundary conditions, we have f (u)Ω+B(u, Du)Ω =

0. Thanks to this, we test the system with u − uΩ to get

ZΩ

hA(u, Du), Dui dx = ZΩ

[hf (u) − f (u)Ω, u − uΩi − hB(u, Du)Ω, u − uΩi] dx.

(5.12)

We estimate the terms on the right hand side. First of all, by H¨older’s inequality

ZΩ

hf (u) − f (u)Ω, u − uΩi dx ≤ (cid:18)ZΩ

|f (u) − f (u)Ω|2 dx(cid:19)

1

2 (cid:18)ZΩ

|u − uΩ|2 dx(cid:19)

.

Applying Poincar´e’s inequality to the functions f (u), u on the right hand side of the above
inequality, we can bound it by

diam(Ω)2(cid:18)ZΩ

|fu(u)|2|Du|2 dx(cid:19)

2 (cid:18)ZΩ

|Du|2 dx(cid:19)

≤ F∗diam(Ω)2kDuk2

L2(Ω),

where F∗ := supΩ |fu(u(x))|. This number is ﬁnite because we are assuming that kukL∞(Ω)
is bounded uniformly.

Similarly, we deﬁne B∗ := supΩ b(u(x)). Using the facts that |B(u, Du)| ≤ b(u)|Du| ≤
B∗|Du|, we have |B(u, Du)Ω| ≤ B∗|Ω|−1kDukL1(Ω). Furthermore, by H¨older’s and Poincar´e’s
inequalities

kDukL1(Ω) ≤ |Ω|

1

2 kDukL2(Ω), ku − uΩkL1(Ω) ≤ C|Ω|

2 diam(Ω)kDukL2(Ω).

We then obtain

Using the above estimates and the ellipticity condition A) in (5.12), we get

If λ0 is suﬃciently large then the above inequality clearly shows that kDukL2(Ω) = 0

and thus u must be a constant vector.

Remark 5.12 If we assume Dirichlet boundary conditions and f (0) ≡ 0 then 0 is the only
solution if λ0 is suﬃciently large. To see this we test the system with u and repeat the
argument in the proof.

The assumption on the boundedness of the L∞ norms of the solutions in Theorem 5.11

can be weakened if λ(u) has a polynomial growth. We have the following result.

Corollary 5.13 The conclusion of Theorem 5.11 continues to hold for the system if one
has a uniform estimate for kukW 1,2(Ω) and λ(u) ∼ λ0 + (1 + |u|)k for some k > 0.

Proof: We just need to show that the two assumptions in fact provide the uniform
bound of L∞ norms needed in the previous proof. From the growth assumption on λ, we
see that the number Λ in (2.2) of Section 2 is now

Λ = sup

W ∈IRm

|λW (W )|

λ(W )

∼ sup

W ∈IRm

(1 + |W |)k−1
λ0 + (1 + |W |)k .

By considering the cases (1 + |W |)k is greater or less that λ0, we can easily see that Λ can
be arbitrarily small if λ0 is suﬃciently large. On the other hand, our assumptions yield
that kukL1(Ω) is uniformly bounded. Thus, we can ﬁx a R0 > 0 and use the fact that
kukBM O(BR0 ) ≤ C(R0)kukL1(Ω) to see that the condition D) of Proposition 2.1 holds if λ0 is
suﬃciently large. We then have that the H¨older norms, and then L∞ norms, of the solutions
to (5.11) are uniformly bounded, independently of λ0. This is the key assumption of the
proof of Theorem 5.11 so that the proof can continue as before.

Remark 5.14 From the examples in Section 3.2, e.g. Lemma 3.8 and Corollary 3.9, we
see that the assumption on uniform bound for W 1,2(Ω) norms can be further weakened by
the same assumption on L1(Ω) norms.
