Abstract. Starting from the deﬁnition of mechanical work for an ideal gas, we present a novel derivation linking global wind
power to measurable atmospheric parameters. The resulting expression distinguishes three components: the kinetic power as-

sociated with horizontal motion, the kinetic power associated with vertical motion and the gravitational power of precipitation.

We discuss the caveats associated with integration of material derivatives in the presence of phase transitions and how these

affect published analyses of global atmospheric power. Using the MERRA database for the years 2009-2015 (three hourly
data on the 1.25◦ × 1.25◦grid at 42 pressure levels) we estimate total atmospheric power at 3.1 W m−2 and kinetic power
at 2.6 W m−2. The difference between the two (0.5 W m−2) is about half the independently estimated gravitational power
of precipitation (1 W m−2). We explain how this discrepancy arises from the limited spatial and temporal resolution of the
database. Our analysis suggests that the total atmospheric power calculated with a spatial resolution of the order of one kilo-
meter (thus capturing the small moist convective eddies) should be around 5 W m−2. We discuss the physical constraints on
global atmospheric power and how considering the dynamic effects of water vapor condensation offers new opportunities.

Introduction

How much power does our atmosphere generate and why? These questions have long challenged theorists (Lorenz, 1967) and

have gained renewed signiﬁcance given how our climate is affected by changes in atmospheric circulation (e.g., Bates, 2012;

Shepherd, 2014). A particular problem is the mismatch between model predictions and observed trends (e.g., Kociuba and Power,

2015). While models suggest general circulation should slow as global temperatures rise, independent observations indicate cir-

culation is getting faster (e.g., de Boisséson et al., 2014). Global wind power appears to be rising as well (Huang and McElroy,

2015). On the other hand, global circulation models tend to overestimate wind power (Boer and Lambert, 2008). For exam-
ple, using the CAM3.5 model Marvel et al. (2013) estimated the global kinetic power of the atmosphere1 at 3.4 W m−2,

1Note however that Boville and Bretherton (2003) cited 2 W m−2 as the kinetic power for the same model. To our knowledge, the inconsistency between

their estimate and that of Marvel et al. (2013) has not been addressed.

1

while published observational estimates range from 2 to 2.5 W m−2 (Kim and Kim, 2013; Schubert and Mitchell, 2013;
Huang and McElroy, 2015).

Our motivation here is to clarify what is meant by total atmospheric power and how we can assess it. Suppose that we know

at a given moment in time the air velocity and pressure gradient for each point in the atmosphere with good resolution. Would

this information be sufﬁcient to estimate the instantaneous global atmospheric power? We found that for us at least the answer

to this question was not self-evident. In Section 2 we explore how the derivation of an expression for the global atmospheric

power is affected by the presence of phase transitions.

In Section 3 we show how the derived relationships require a revision of the recent estimates of atmospheric wind power

proposed by Laliberté et al. (2015). In Section 4 we discuss how the global wind power in a hydrostatic atmosphere can be

represented as a sum of three distinct physical components. Two components dominate in a hydrostatic atmosphere: the kinetic

power of the wind generated by horizontal pressure gradients and the gravitational power of precipitation generated by the

ascending air. In Section 5 we illustrate our formulations by analysing the atmospheric power budget using the MERRA

database (Rienecker et al., 2011). We discuss how estimates of atmospheric power are affected by resolution of the data.

In the concluding section we discuss theoretical constraints on atmospheric power. There are two problems: to explain

why wind power on Earth is signiﬁcantly different from zero (minimal threshold) and to ﬁnd a constraint from above on this

power (maximum threshold). We discuss the opportunities provided by consideration of the dynamic effects of condensation

in combination with conventional thermodynamic approach.

2 Atmospheric power in the presence of phase transitions

The atmosphere comprises compressible gases and small amounts of incompressible solid and liquid water. We begin with

calculating work performed by the atmospheric gases. We treat them as ideal gases with the equation of state

p = N RT.

(1)

Here T is temperature, N is air molar density (mol m−3), V ≡ N −1 is the atmospheric volume occupied by one mole of air, p
is air pressure and R = 8.3 J mol−1 K−1 is the universal gas constant.

Work per unit time (power) of an air parcel containing ˜N moles and occupying volume ˜V ≡ ˜N V (m3) is

d ˜V

We now consider an atmosphere composed of n air parcels with total volume V ≡Pn

(2)

i=1

˜Vi =RV dV (subscript i refers to

the i-th air parcel). We deﬁne V as the volume bounded by the Earth’s surface and the surface corresponding to some ﬁxed
pressure level pT at the top of the atmosphere, e.g. to pT = 0.1 hPa. This is the uppermost level in many atmospheric datasets
including those in the MERRA project.

The number of molecules (moles) ˜N in each air parcel can only change via an inﬂow (outﬂow) of molecules through
the parcel’s boundary. This change results from either diffusion of molecules between the adjacent parcels or from phase

2

transitions or from both. Since in the case of diffusion any molecule leaving one parcel, d ˜N1/dt < 0, arrives to some other
parcel, d ˜N2/dt = −d ˜N1/dt > 0, all the diffusion terms cancel in the global sum of the last term in Eq. (2) over all parcels.
What remains corresponds to phase transitions:

where ˙N is the molar rate of phase transitions per unit volume (mol m−3 s−1). Its integral over volume V is equal to the total
˙N includes the inﬂow (outﬂow)
rate of phase transitions in all the n air parcels. By virtue of the conservation relationship (3)
into all the air parcels from all liquid or solid surfaces (droplet surface in the atmospheric interior or the Earth’s surface).

Using Eqs. (2) and (3) we can write total power W of the n air parcels composing the atmosphere as

Here S is the Earth’s surface area and W is in W m−2.

(4)

The exact differential dX/dt for X = {p, T, V, ...} that describes change within each air parcel in the atmospheric context

corresponds to the material derivative:

dX

≡

∂X
∂t

+ v · ∇X,

where v is the mean velocity of gas molecules within the parcel.

Using the continuity equation

˙N =

dN
dt

+ N (∇ · v)

and the ideal gas law (1) in the form dp/dt = RN dT /dt + RT dN/dt we obtain for W from Eq. (4):

W =

(7)

The magnitude of ∇ · v is the rate of relative volume change of a material element at a given point (e.g., Batchelor, 2000,
p. 75). This change, (1/ ˜V )d ˜V /dt depends only on the difference in velocities of its bounding material surfaces which are not
directly impacted by phase transitions. Therefore, W (7) does not explicitly depend on ˙N .
We can use the divergence theorem (Gauss-Ostrogradsky theorem) to re-write W (7) as

W = IS −

(v · n)dS.

(8)

(9)

Here n is the outward-pointing unit vector perpendicular to the surface area dS; the surface integral is taken over the Earth’s
surface and the upper boundary z = z(pT ), where z(pT ) is the altitude of the pressure level p = pT . Since the macroscopic

3

air parcels do not penetrate the Earth’s surface2, for z = 0 we have v · n = 0. At the upper boundary v is zero in the steady
state only, when the total volume V of the air parcels does not change. Generally for z = z(pT ) we have v · n 6= 0 (a similar
condition of non-zero velocity at the upper boundary (the oceanic surface) is commonly used in oceanic science, e.g. Tailleux

(2015)).

3 Practical implications of the obtained relationships

3.1 The material derivative of enthalpy

In a recent effort to constrain the atmospheric power budget, Laliberté et al. (2015) used the thermodynamic identity

T

≡

dh
dt

−

1
ρ

+ µ

(10)

where s is entropy, h is enthalpy, µ is chemical potential (all per unit mass of wet air), 1/ρ is speciﬁc air volume and qT is the
mass fraction of total water3. Laliberté et al. (2015) neglected, as we do, the atmospheric liquid and solid water content4 and
approximated qT = qv, where qv is the mass fraction of water vapor.

When integrating Eq. (10) over atmospheric mass, Laliberté et al. (2015) assumed that the enthalpy term vanishes,RM(dh/dt)dM =

0. This assumption was justiﬁed by noting that the atmosphere is approximately in a steady state. However, the correct condition
for the steady atmospheric state is different. It corresponds to zero enthalpy change in all air parcels combined:

where d˜hi/dt is the change of enthalpy ˜hi of the i-th air parcel which has mass mi and mass-speciﬁc enthalpy hi.

where ˙ρ is the mass rate of phase transitions per unit volume (kg m−3 s−1) obeying the steady-state continuity equation

∇ · (ρv) = ˙ρ.

(11)

(12)

(13)

2The molecular process of evaporation from the Earth’s surface can be viewed as an upward ﬂux of gaseous molecules that are concentrated within one free
path length l from the evaporating surface and have mean vertical velocity wE of the order of mean molecular velocity. Molar density NE of such molecules is
obtained from evaporation rate E (kg m−2 s−1) as NE wE = E/Mv, where Mv is molar mass of water. Due to the presence of these molecules, macroscopic
air parcels adjacent to the surface could have a non-zero vertical velocity ws deﬁned as the mean vertical velocity of all molecules in the parcel. If lp is the
linear size of this parcel, we have ws = wENE l/(Nslp), where Ns = ps/(RTs) is molar density of air at the surface, Ts and ps are surface temperature
and pressure. Then for the vertical term p(v · n) at the surface, Eq. (9), we have psws = (l/lp)ERTs/Mv. Since as we will see in Sections 5 and 6 global
atmospheric power is of the order of P RTs/Mv, where P = E is the global mean precipitation and evaporation, the surface term psws can be neglected in
Eq. (9) if l/lp ≪ 1, i.e. on any macroscopic length scale.

3The unconventional sign at the chemical potential term follows from µ being deﬁned in Eq. (10) relative to dry air: hence, when the relative dry air content

diminishes this term is negative. For details see p. 8 in the Supplementary Materials of Laliberté et al. (2015).

4This assumption corresponds to an instantaneous removal of the non-gaseous water from the atmosphere by precipitation.

4

As is clear from Eq. (11), when the atmosphere is in a steady state (∂htot/∂t = 0) the mass integral of the material derivative
of enthalpy is not zero. It can be roughly estimated by assuming that all evaporation occurs at the surface z = 0, while all
condensation occurs at mean condensation height z = HP :

˙ρ(x, y, z) = E(x, y)δ(z) − P (x, y)δ(z − HP ), E = P, E ≡

(14)

(15)

Here E(x, y) and P (x, y) are local evaporation and precipitation at the surface (kg m−2 s−1) with global averages E and P ;
subscript s denotes surface values z = 0; δ(z) is the Dirac delta function; cp = 103 J kg−1 K−1 is heat capacity of air at constant
pressure, L = 2.5×106 J kg−1 is latent heat of vaporization. For HP ≈ 2.5 km (Makarieva et al., 2013a) and qv(HP ) ≪ qvs we
have −P ∆hc = −P (cpHP Γ + Lqvs) ≈ −1 W m−2. Here qvs = 0.0083 corresponds to global mean surface temperature Ts =
288 K and relative humidity 80%; mean tropospheric lapse rate is Γ = 6.5 K km−1. Global mean precipitation P (measured in
a system of units where liquid water density ρw = 103 kg m−3 is set to unity) is equal to P ∼ 1 m year−1, which in SI units
corresponds to P = 3.2 × 10−5 kg m−2 s−1. A more sophisticated estimate5 of integral (15) presented in Appendix A yields
−1.6 W m−2 with an accuracy of about 30%.

These estimates show that the enthalpy term cannot be neglected in Eq. (10) on either theoretical or quantitative grounds.
By absolute magnitude the integral (15) is greater than one third of the total atmospheric power W ≈ 4 W m−2 estimated by
Laliberté et al. (2015) for the MERRA re-analysis (3.66 W m−2) and the CESM model (4.01 W m−2).

Laliberté et al. (2015) ﬁrst calculated the mass integral of T ds/dt from the right-hand side of Eq. (10), then calculated
µdqT /dt from atmospheric data and then used the obtained values and again Eq. 10 to estimate the total atmospheric power

as −(1/S)RM(1/ρ)(dp/dt)dM. In such a procedure, putting RM(dh/dt)dM = 0 should have overestimated W by about

1.6 W m−2. Since the omitted term is proportional to the global precipitation rate, it is crucial not only for a correct estimate
of the mean value of W , but also for the determination of any trends related to precipitation.

Note also that even in the correct form, with the enthalpy term retained, Eq. (10) does not provide a theoretical constraint on
W . This equation is an identity: it essentially deﬁnes ds/dt in terms of measurable atmospheric data. As is clear from Eq. (8),
W can be estimated from the same data directly without involving entropy, see Section 5.

3.2 Material derivative of pressure dp/dt and atmospheric power

Equations (2)-(8) clarify the relationship between atmospheric power and dp/dt (W m−3). Global atmospheric power W
is, in the general case, not equal to the mass integral of −(1/ρ)dp/dt (or volume integral of dp/dt, which is the same since

5The physical meaning of the negative sign of the enthalpy integral (15) can be understood as follows. This integral describes how much air belongs to
the air parcels decreasing their enthalpy (dh/dt < 0) compared to how much air belongs to the air parcels increasing their enthalpy (dh/dt > 0). In the
absence of phase transitions these masses are equal. There is as much gas going upwards, as there is going downwards. Hence, RM(dh/dt)dM = 0. In the
presence of condensation and evaporation, these masses are not equal. Water vapor is "created" by evaporation at the planetary surface and then "destroyed"
by condensation at some height HP > 0. In the result, at any height z > 0 there is, on average, more gas going upwards than downwards. In the ascending
air dh/dt < 0 (it cools and loses water vapor). Therefore, RM(dh/dt)dM < 0.

dM = ρdV). While the deﬁnition of material derivative (5) includes partial derivative over time, we have seen that atmospheric
work output W does not depend on ∂p/∂t, see Eqs. (8), (7). Indeed, from Eq. (8) and (5) we ﬁnd:

W = −

SZV

dp
dt

dV +

S ZV

∂p
∂t

dV + IS.

(16)

In the steady state, when the volume of the atmosphere is constant, the last two terms in the right-hand side of Eq. (16) are zero.
Since the distribution of pressure versus altitude in the atmosphere is approximately exponential and since IS is proportional
to pT , by choosing a sufﬁciently small upper boundary pressure pT it is possible to ensure that the instantaneous value of IS
(9) is arbitrarily small compared to the instantaneous W (see Fig. 6d in Appendix C). Everywhere below we put IS = 0.

The long-term average of the second integral in the right-hand side of (16) is also zero. However, its instantaneous value de-
pends on temperature tendency ∂T /∂t and is not necessarily negligible compared to W . This term describes pressure changes
that are not related to power output but reﬂect how internal energy of the atmosphere varies with changing atmospheric volume

and/or mass (see Appendix C for details).

Locally, even in the stationary case when ∂p/∂t = 0, material derivative of pressure −dp/dt ≡ −v·∇p is not equal to power
output per unit volume of the local air parcel (pd ˜V /dt)/ ˜V (W m−3). From Eq. (7), which holds true for an arbitrary volume
V, we have

p

1
˜V

d ˜V
dt

= p(∇ · v) = −v · ∇p + ∇ · (pv).

(17)

These magnitudes have different physical meaning. While p(∇ · v) describes power output per unit volume of the local air
parcel, −v ·∇p describes power output per unit volume of the local pressure gradient. It is work performed per unit time by the
force of the local pressure gradient on the air contained in the considered unit volume. Global integrals of −v · ∇p and p(∇ · v)
coincide and equal global atmospheric power W when IS in (8) is zero.

4 Revisiting the current understanding of the atmospheric power budget

We now show how total atmospheric power (8) can be decomposed into distinct terms. In Eq. (8) the expression −v · ∇p =
−u · ∇p − w · ∇p represents total work performed by the pressure gradient per unit time per unit air volume. The horizontal
pressure gradient generates the kinetic energy of the horizontal wind u. The vertical pressure gradient generates the kinetic

energy of the vertical wind w plus it changes the potential energy of air in the gravitational ﬁeld.

In hydrostatic equilibrium we have

∇zp = ρg,

(18)

where ρ = N M is air density (kg m−3), M is air molar mass (kg mol−1). In the real atmosphere due to the presence of
non-gaseous water the air distribution deviates from Eq. (18) such that we have ∇zp = (ρ + ρl)g and in Eq. (8) −w · ∇p =
−ρw · g − ρlw · g, where ρl is mass density of the non-gaseous water in the air.

6

Term −ρw·g = −ρv·g represents the vertical ﬂux of air: it is positive (negative) for the ascending (descending) air. Recalling

that g = −g∇z and using the divergence theorem and the stationary continuity equation (13) we can write

WP ≡ −

(19)

The surface integral in (19) is taken at the Earth’s surface (here it is zero because z = 0) and z = z(pT ) (here it is also zero,
because ρn · v = 0).

For a dry atmosphere where ˙ρ = 0, the last volume integral in Eq. (19) is zero and WP = 0: indeed, in this case at any height
z there is as much air going upwards as there is going downwards6. In a moist atmosphere, evaporation ˙ρ > 0 (condensation
˙ρ < 0) makes a negative (positive) contribution to WP . This is because WP reﬂects the work of water vapor as it travels from
the level where evaporation occurs (where water vapor arises) to the level where condensation occurs (where water vapor

disappears). When condensation takes place above where evaporation occurs, the water vapor expands as it moves upwards

towards condensation, and the work is positive.

When evaporation occurs at the Earth’s surface z = 0, WP (19) is equal to P gHP , where HP is the global mean height of
condensation. It is natural to call WP the "gravitational power of precipitation". Pauluis et al. (2000) estimated the value of
WP for the tropics. Their estimate was revised by Pauluis and Dias (2012) and by Makarieva et al. (2013a) who also estimated
global WP as 0.8 W m−2. (Here we revised this latter estimate upwards by 20%, see Appendix A).

(22)

Equations Eqs. (20)-(22) and their derivation have not been previously published. These equations clarify the physical
meaning of the atmospheric power budget. While we deﬁne W (4) as the power output of ideal gas parcels, this power includes
WP – the gravitational power of precipitation. The meaning is that hydrometeors perform work at the expense of their potential
energy. To acquire this energy, a corresponding amount of water vapor must be raised by air parcels. We can also see that WP
does not depend on the interaction between the air and the falling hydrometeors. This term would be present in the atmospheric

power budget even if hydrometeors were experiencing free fall and did not interact with the air at all (such that no frictional

dissipation on hydrometeors occurred).

The term −ρlw · g in Eq. (21) is not related to the gravitational power of precipitation. It describes kinetic energy gen-
eration on the vertical scale of the order of the atmospheric scale height H ≡ −p/(∂p/∂z) = RT /(M g) ∼ 10 km. This en-
ergy is generated because the vertical air distribution deviates from the hydrostatic equilibrium (18). Hydrometeors act as

6Note that using the continuity equations for dry air ∇ · (ρd v) = 0 and water vapor ∇ · (ρv v) = ˙ρ, where ρd and ρv are densities of dry air and water

vapor, we ﬁnd from Eq. (19) that WP = −(1/S) RV ρvw · gdV.

resistance preventing the pressure difference ∆p ∼ ρlgH from converting to the kinetic energy of a vertical wind. In the at-
mosphere on average ρl/ρ ∼ 10−5 (Makarieva et al., 2013a). Without hydrometeors, the non-equilibrium pressure difference
∆p ∼ 10−5ρgH ∼ 1 Pa would produce maximum vertical velocity of about wm ∼ 1 m s−1 (ρw2
m/2 = ∆p). This is two orders
of magnitude larger than the characteristic vertical velocities w ∼ 10−2 m s−1 of large-scale air motions. (Hydrometeors thus
inhibit vertical motion in a similar way turbulent friction at the surface inhibit horizontal air motion. For example, the observed
meridional surface pressure differences of the order of ∆ph ∼ 10 hPa in the tropics, if friction were absent, could have pro-
duced maximum horizontal air velocities of about um ∼ 40 m s−1 (ρu2
m/2 = ∆ph).) Quantitatively, −ρlw · g is less than 1%
of W and can be neglected: its volume integral taken per unit surface area is less than ρlgHw ∼ 10−5pw ∼ 10−2 W m−2,
where p = ρgH = 105 Pa is air pressure at the surface.

In some publications kinetic power is assumed equal to the volume integral of dp/dt (e.g., Robertson et al., 2011, their Eq. 1).
Here we have seen that the long-term mean of this integral is equal to total power W , Eq. (16). However, the instantaneous value
of this integral is not equal to the instantantaneous value of W , see also Appendix (C). In other studies kinetic power is correctly
deﬁned and estimated from horizontal velocities as WK (21) (see, e.g., Boville and Bretherton, 2003; Huang and McElroy,
2015). In such studies WK is sometimes confused with total atmospheric power: i.e. in the total power budget the gravitational
power of precipitation, WP , is overlooked (e.g., Huang and McElroy, 2015, their Fig. 10). We also note that the gravitational
power of precipitation WP has not been explicitly identiﬁed in past studies assessing the conversion rates between available
potential and kinetic energies in the framework of the Lorenz energy cycle (see, e.g., Kim and Kim, 2013, and references

therein).

The fact that kinetic power WK (21) depends on horizontal and not vertical velocities is essential for comparing theory and
observations. Horizontal pressure gradients and wind velocities are observed directly, while vertical velocities are inferred only

indirectly and with signiﬁcant uncertainty (see Appendix C).

5 Observation-based estimates of global atmospheric power

5.1 Total power W

In meteorological databases including the MERRA dataset MAI3CPASM that we used (see Appendix B for details), dp/dt is
often represented as a separate variable named pressure velocity (omega). We estimated W as

W = hΩi, Ω ≡ −

Time averaging denoted as hi was made over seven years, 2009-2015. Using instantaneous omega values provided each three
hours at 42 pressure levels on the 1.25◦ × 1.25◦grid we obtained two estimates, W1 = 2.97 W m−2 and W2 = 3.24 W m−2
depending on how the local omega value at the Earth’s surface was estimated. The value of W1 ≡ hΩ1i was obtained by linearly
extrapolating the omega value from the two nearest pressure levels, see Eq. (B3), while W2 ≡ hΩ2i was obtained assuming

that omega at the surface is equal to the surface pressure tendency ∂ps/∂t, see Eq. (B4). The results are shown in Fig. 1a and
Table 1.

Laliberté et al. (2015) using their Eq. (10) estimated total atmospheric power from the MERRA database as WL = 3.66 W m−2.

Both W1 and W2 are signiﬁcantly smaller. We have W1 − WL = −0.69 W m−2 (19%) and W2 − WL = −0.42 W m−2 (12%).
As discussed in Section 3, the difference between W and WL, caused by the omission of the enthalpy term in Eq. (10), should
be equal to the enthalpy term (15) of about −1.6 W m−2. The actual difference is the same order of magnitude with our
estimate (15) but is about 60% smaller, Table 1.

This discrepancy may be a consequence of Laliberté et al. (2015) using different MERRA datasets (MAI3NECHM, MAI6NVANA,

MAT3NVCHM). These data have a 0.67◦ × 0.5◦ lon-lat resolution and are provided on 72 vertical levels. However, pressure
velocity is not provided. It was calculated by Laliberté et al. (2015) from horizontal velocities using a correction procedure

to ensure mass conservation (see the Supplementary Materials of Laliberté et al., 2015, for details). The impact of this proce-

dure on the obtained results was not investigated. We employed the "ready-to-use" omega values from the MERRA dataset

providers. Another reason for the discrepancy is the resolution of the data – this is a topic we examine further below.

5.2 Kinetic power WK

Two estimates of kinetic power were obtained (Fig. 1a and Table 1): WK1 = 2.70 W m−2 by extrapolating u · ∇p linearly
to the surface from the two nearest pressure levels, see Eq. (B12), and WK2 = 2.53 W m−2 assuming v = 0 and u · ∇p = 0
at the surface, see Eq. (B13). The second estimate is close to the long-term mean kinetic power 2.46 W m−2 obtained by
Huang and McElroy (2015) for 1979-2010.

The difference between the estimates W1 and W2 and WK1 and WK2 stems from different assumptions about the value of
the integrated quantity (ω or u·∇p) at the surface. The surface layer averages about 13 hPa higher pressure than p1 = 1000 hPa,

the pressure of the ﬁrst layer in the MERRA database. This difference corresponds to an atmospheric layer about H1 ∼ 100 m
thick. Estimates W2 and WK2 are based on the assumption that at the surface v = 0 and u·∇p = 0 (see Appendix B). However,
within the boundary layer air velocity becomes essentially non-zero reaching a few meters per second at a height Hv of
the order of a few meters (e.g., Beare et al., 2006). Thus, linear extrapolation from v = 0 at the surface to its known value
at pressure level p1, i.e. from z = 0 to z = H1 ≫ Hv, does not accurately reﬂect the velocity proﬁle of the surface layer
between ps and p1. Estimates W1 and WK1, on the other hand, assume that within the surface layer the integrated quantity
varies in the vertical in the same manner as it does between the two pressure levels nearest to the surface (e.g., between
p1 = 1000 hPa and p2 = 975 hPa), see Eqs. (B3) and (B12). With increasing vertical resolution, the two estimates should
coincide. At present resolution, they differ by 10% for W1 and W2 and by 6% for WK1 and WK2. Lacking better guidance,
we will use the mean of the two estimates as a representative value. We then have W = (W1 + W2)/2 = 3.1 W m−2 and
WK = (WK1 + WK2)/2 = 2.6 W m−2, Table 1.

The interannual variation of global atmospheric power is relatively small. Total power W had its minimum of 3.05 W m−2
in 2011 and maximum of 3.21 W m−2 in 2015. Kinetic power WK had its minimum of 2.57 W m−2 in 2009 and 2011 and
maximum of 2.72 W m−2 in 2015, see Table 3 in Appendix B.

While the global mean values of W and WK differ by a relatively small margin, their local values differ by more than
an order of magnitude and have different spatial distributions, Fig. 2. Total atmospheric power is positive (negative) in the

regions of ascent (descent); local values may exceed the global mean by nearly two orders of magnitude. The kinetic power

is more spatially uniform. It is nearly ubiquitously positive in the lower atmosphere below the 800 hPa pressure level: 58% of

global kinetic power is generated below 800 hPa. In the upper atmosphere negative kinetic power occurs in the region of the

atmospheric heat pumps (Ferrel cells) (Makarieva et al., 2015c).

The difference between W and WK should be equal to the gravitational power of precipitation WP , Eq. (20). As estimated
from the MERRA database, this difference amounts to 0.5 W m−2, Table 1. This is half the independent estimate of WP =
1 W m−2 obtained using the observed precipitation, see Appendix A.

This shortfall arises from the coarse resolution in the MERRA database. In convection eddies, air rises approximately moist

adiabatically and descends dry adiabatically. Provided most condensed moisture is removed by precipitation, within such

eddies the water vapor mixing ratio decreases in the ascending air and remains approximately constant in the descending

air. In consequence, if we average over many such eddies we will ﬁnd that the mean mixing ratio decreases with height

everywhere within the averaging area. Now, if the considered area has on average a negative large-scale vertical velocity
w < 0, this means that in this descending air the mixing ratio is increasing – this is equivalent to a source of water vapor in
the atmospheric interior. Here we will call this artifact "spurious evaporation". Since according to Eq. (22) evaporation in the
atmospheric interior reduces WP , spatial averaging over an area larger than that of individual convective eddies (∼ 1 − 10 km)
underestimates WP .

The difference between the monthly mean values of the volume integral of pressure velocity (23) and WK does not correlate
positively with monthly mean precipitation (as WP should). In particular, the summer maximum of precipitation corresponds
to a minimum of Ω − WK, Fig. 1b. One possible reason is that the integral of the pressure tendency ∂p/∂t that distinguishes Ω

affecting the monthly estimate of atmospheric power. In Appendix C we consider the seasonal cycle of the volume integral of

the pressure tendency and evaluate its magnitude in greater detail.

Kinetic power WK , on the other hand, is better correlated with global precipitation, Fig. 1c and Fig. 3. Relative changes of
WK are the same order of magnitude as changes of P . Both WK and P have two peaks, one in summer and another in winter,
Fig. 3.

6 Discussion and conclusions: Towards constraining the atmospheric power

We have shown how atmospheric power W can be deﬁned in terms of measurable atmospheric variables, Eqs. (20)-(22).
We used the MERRA database to quantify the atmospheric power budget, Table 1. We found that the gravitational power of
precipitation WP estimated as the difference between total power W and kinetic power WK is around 30-70% smaller than
independent estimates obtained from observations of precipitation. This discrepancy results from the limited resolution of the

MERRA database. Coarse spatial and temporal averaging causes "spurious evaporation" to occur in the large-scale descending
air motions thus reducing the magnitude of all quantities - including WP - proportional to condensation rate (Section 5.2).

That the data resolution has a major impact on WP gains further support from the analyses of the water budget in the MERRA
database (Bosilovich et al., 2011). Here an atmospheric moisture budget consistent with observations cannot be retrieved from

the observed wind speeds and water vapor mixing ratios alone: an additional correction ("analysis") term must be added to

the mass equation for atmospheric water. This correction term is of the order of the difference between local evaporation and
˙ρdz in the vertically integrated continuity equation (13).
Thus WP cannot be retrieved from the MERRA database based on only the continuity equations (6), (13) that underlie the
estimate of atmospheric power W .

Next we consider how our results are relevant to the problem of ﬁnding constraints on global atmospheric power.

6.1 The upper limit

Power output of a system cannot exceed the power output WC of the Carnot cycle. To quantify this limit on atmospheric power,
three variables are required: input temperature Tin, output temperature Tout and heat ﬂux F :

WC = F

∆TC
Tin

, ∆TC ≡ Tin − Tout, F = FL + FS.

(24)

13

Here F (W m−2) is equal to the sum of latent FL and sensible FS heat ﬂuxes. The heat ﬂux available to the Earth’s atmospheric
engine is limited by the incoming ﬂux of solar radiation. The minimum output temperature Tout = TE is set by the Earth’s
albedo and orbital position: it is the temperature at which the atmosphere emits thermal radiation to space. The actual output
temperature of the atmospheric engine can be higher, Tout ≥ TE: in this case the part of the atmosphere that produces work
would release heat not directly to space but to the upper atmospheric layers. The upper atmosphere will further transmit heat to
space without generating work. The input temperature is bounded from above by temperature Ts of the Earth’s surface, Tin ≤
Ts, and thus depends on the magnitude of the greenhouse effect ∆T ≡ Ts − TE. However, this magnitude is a priori unknown.
With the Earth’s extensive oceans, there is a positive feedback between surface temperature and atmospheric moisture, since

this moisture is itself a major greenhouse substance. This means that the greenhouse effect on an Earth-like planet could range
within broad limits. Even among the planets of the solar system the maximum Carnot efﬁciency ∆T /Ts varies at least six-fold
(Schubert and Mitchell, 2013).

If we cannot predict ∆T from theory, there is only one robust theoretical limit on W that we can infer from thermodynamics:
W cannot be larger than approximately F (TS − TE)/TS, where TS is the Sun’s temperature. This is the upper limit that is
given by consideration of entropy production on the Earth. The global efﬁciency of solar energy conversion into useful work

amounts to about 90% (Wu and Liu (2010); see also Pelkowski (2012) for a rigorous theoretical discussion). This is about two

orders of magnitude larger than the observed efﬁciency of atmospheric circulation, which is of the order of 1% of the incoming

solar radiation. The thermodynamic theoretical upper limit alone is therefore of limited use for constraining the atmospheric

power.

We need additional constraints on atmospheric power. One arises from consideration of the dynamic properties of atmo-

spheric water vapor. The pressure of saturated water vapor is controlled by temperature (unlike temperature and molar density

as occurs for any non-condensable gas). In the presence of a gravitational ﬁeld, this property has important consequences:

while dry air can rise adiabatically in a state inﬁnitely close to hydrostatic equilibrium, the saturated water vapor cannot.

The resulting dynamics can be illustrated on the example of a simple system: a horizontally homogeneous atmosphere
composed of pure water vapor, where there is only vertical motion, v = w. The water vapor condenses as it rises and water
returns to the Earth in its solid or liquid form. In this case kinetic energy is produced per unit volume at a rate of −w(∂pv/∂z +
ρvg) = −w(∂pv/∂z + pv/Hv). Here ρv is mass density of water vapor and Hv ≡ RT /(Mvg) ≈ 13 km is the hydrostatic scale
height for water vapor (see also Makarieva et al., 2013b, 2014, and references therein). If the pressure distribution of water
vapor were hydrostatic, then total power −w · ∇p (W m−3) would be spent to raise the potential energy of the ascending
gas, leaving nothing to kinetic power. When saturated water vapor rises and cools, its partial pressure diminishes governed by

decreasing temperature, the sum in braces is not zero and the hydrostatic equilibrium is not possible.

In the real atmosphere, in the presence of a sufﬁcient amount of non-condensable gases a hydrostatic equilibrium is possi-
ble. If it is realized, the kinetic power WKc that derives from condensation of water vapor (which retains a non-hydrostatic

14

distribution) is generated in the horizontal plane:

Hv ≡ RTc/(Mvg), H ≡ RTc/(M g); Tc is mean temperature at which condensation occurs. Its global value Tc = 270 K is
estimated in Appendix A. Details of theoretical estimate (25) were elaborated elsewhere (see Makarieva et al., 2013b, 2015a,

and references therein). Here we discuss not the result per se, but its implications for understanding the atmosphere as a heat

engine.

From Eqs. (20)-(22) and (25) for total power Wc of the condensation-driven circulation we obtain

(28)

Here L = 45 × 103 J mol−1 is the latent heat of vaporization, Π = FL/L. A remarkable property of Eq. (28) is that total power
is proportional to the absolute temperature Tc and, unlike the Carnot equation (24), is not related to any temperature difference.
For cases when ∆TC ≪ Ts ≈ Tc, the two equations combined constrain ∆TC. Putting Wc = WC in Eqs. (28) and (24) we ﬁnd

∆TC = Tc(cid:18) RTs

L (cid:19) 1 + HP /Hv

≈ 15 K.

(29)

Here we used FL = 85 W m−2, FS = 19 W m−2 (Ohmura and Raschke, 2005), HP = 3.4 km, see Appendix A, Hv =
RTc/(Mvg) = 12.7 km, and Ts = 288 K as the global mean surface temperature.

This theoretical estimate of ∆TC obtained under the assumption (25) that the circulation on Earth is condensation-driven
coincides within 20% with an independent estimate of ∆Tc ≡ Ts − Tc = 18 K between the surface temperature and the mean
condensation temperature Tc, Eq. (A5). This consistency suggests that the condensation-driven circulation on Earth is equiv-
alent to Carnot cycle operating between the surface temperature and the mean temperature Tc = 270 K where condensation
occurs. This agrees with the observation that a major part of kinetic power is generated in the lower atmosphere, Fig. 2. The

gravitational power of precipitation follows the vertical proﬁle of the water vapor mixing ratio and is also maximum in the

lower atmosphere, see Fig. 2 of Pauluis and Dias (2012) and Fig. 2 of Makarieva et al. (2013a).

The global kinetic power estimated from Eq. (25) using Tc = 270 K and P = 0.96 m year−1 is 3.8 W m−2, Table 1. This
theoretical estimate is 30% higher than our estimate of WK = 2.6 W m−2 obtained using the MERRA re-analysis. Similarly,
theoretical estimate of the gravitational power of precipitation WP derived from global precipitation is about 50% higher than
its MERRA-derived estimate as the difference between W and WK (20), Table 1. The theoretical estimate of the mass integral
of dh/dt (15) is also about 70% higher (by absolute magnitude) than its MERRA-derived estimate.

15

We have suggested that in the latter two cases this discrepancy can be attributed to the coarse spatial and temporal resolution

of the MERRA database. Averaging air velocity and water vapor mixing ratios over areas and time periods exceeding the area

and lifespan of air motions associated with condensation decreases mean condensation rate. In the result, all variables that are
proportional to condensation, including WP (22) and the dh/dt integral (15), are underestimated in the MERRA database.
From this logic we can expect that with increasing spatial and temporal resolution the atmospheric power estimated from

observations should grow. In agreement with these ideas, Kim and Kim (2013) using the daily averaged MERRA data obtained
WK = 2 W m−2, which is 20% less than the value obtained by Huang and McElroy (2015) and by us here using three hourly
data. Total atmospheric power calculated with a sufﬁcient resolution capturing the motions that cause condensation is thus
likely to be around 5 W m−2, Table 1.

The fact that WKc is likewise higher than our MERRA-derived kinetic power, testiﬁes in favor of the theoretical estimate
(25). To explain this point in greater detail: Eq. (15) and Eq. (22), which estimate, respectively, the mass integral of dh/dt and
the gravitational power of precipitation WP , are not dependent on the assumption that air circulation on Earth is condensation-
driven. These equations describe how the corresponding variables can be estimated from observations. Both variables are

approximately proportional to the volume integral of net condensation rate in the atmospheric interior −Rz>0 ˙ρdV. We notice

that both variables estimated from the MERRA database are by 50-70% smaller than when estimated independently from the
observed global precipitation P . We attribute this to the insufﬁcient spatial resolution of the air motions associated with con-
densation. Now, we predict that if atmospheric circulation is condensation-driven, kinetic power generation is also proportional
to P , as described by Eq. (25). Since we already know that not all condensation is resolved in the MERRA dataset, we can ex-
pect that kinetic energy generation estimated from MERRA using Eq. (21) will be smaller by a comparable magnitude than its

theoretical estimate (25). This is what we ﬁnd. If kinetic power was unrelated to precipitation, we could not expect that its value

would be smaller than the precipitation-based theoretical estimate (25). If, on the other hand, our theoretical estimate turned
out to be smaller than the MERRA-derived estimate, WKc < WK, this would testify against condensation-induced dynamics.

6.2 The lower limit

Why does the atmosphere generate any appreciable power at all, i.e. what determines the lower limit of W ? Atmospheric power
W can be viewed as a measure of the dynamic disequilibrium of the Earth’s atmosphere. In equilibrium, for example, under
conditions of hydrostatic and geostrophic or cyclostrophic balance, no power is generated: W = 0. There is no vertical air
motion and practically no precipitation. There are no surface ﬂuxes of sensible and latent heat. In global circulation models a

non-zero rate of kinetic energy generation is achieved by introducing an ad hoc intensity of turbulent diffusion, which is chosen

by ﬁtting the model to observations. Turbulent diffusion determines the rate at which kinetic energy is dissipated (and, in the

steady state, generated) (see also discussion in Makarieva et al., 2015b). It is this, and related parameterizations of dissipative
processes, that postulate a certain non-zero value of W in the terrestrial atmosphere and control its behavior. For example,
putting turbulent diffusion in the atmospheric interior close to zero, Held and Hou (1980) described an otherwise realistic

general circulation in a dry atmosphere that was about an order of magnitude less intense than observed on Earth. We ﬁnd no

obvious grounds to expect that the atmospheric circulation on Earth could not be signiﬁcantly weaker than it is today.

16

To what degree does atmospheric power depend on the Earth possessing a moist atmosphere? A moist atmosphere dif-

fers from a dry atmosphere by manifesting distinct processes that can generate air motion. One, the release of latent heat in

the ascending air, has received much attention in studies of the atmospheric heat engine (e.g., Goody, 2003; Pauluis, 2011;

Kleidon et al., 2014; Kieu, 2015).

Condensation-induced dynamics introduces a distinct mechanism: any upward motion of a saturated air parcel results in

condensation and precipitation which diminishes local surface pressure via a hydrostatic adjustment. This leads to air conver-

gence towards the resulting low pressure. Irrespective of whether this initial air motion gets extinguished or sustains itself via
persistent condensation of laterally imported water vapor, a certain amount of kinetic energy is generated7. In a dry atmosphere
this mechanism does not exist, since upward displacements of dry air do not change the amount of gas.

These condensation-related mechanisms permit self-induced air motion. Condensation occurs and the condensation-related

potential energy is released as the air rises in the gravitational ﬁeld of Earth. This implies a positive feedback between the

motion of moist air and the release of potential energy that sustains it. In a dry atmosphere such positive feedback is absent.

One can expect that this positive feedback will drive the atmosphere to a state when it will consume all available power such

that condensation rate is maximized. Such an atmosphere will be circulating in the vertical dimension with its vertical velocity

constrained by the absorbed solar power and the condition of maximum precipitation and minimum net radiative and sensible

heat ﬂuxes. On Earth, precipitation accounts for a major part of the solar power absorbed so this situation is realistic. In a dry

atmosphere, with such mechanisms for self-induced air motions absent, atmospheric power can remain much lower.

Whether the atmospheric power would be negligible on a dry Earth is a theoretical question. The parameterization of turbu-

lence in current models is generally unrelated to the hydrological cycle (i.e. one and the same turbulent diffusion coefﬁcient can
be used in both dry and moist models). Therefore, comparing W across current models with varying intensity of the hydrologi-
cal cycle cannot clarify the role of water vapor. What is needed are theoretical insights that could be tested against observations.

Direct tests are unfeasable – one cannot dry the Earth’s atmosphere to see what happens. But one can study phenomena such as

tropical cyclones that require condensation and see whether similar processes can clarify global atmospheric circulation (see,

e.g., Makarieva et al., 2015a). One can investigate circulation power on planets with or without intense phase transitions.

Furthermore, one could re-formulate dissipative processes in the existing global circulation models such that they conform

to condensation-driven dynamics and see how they perform. Currently the parameterization of dissipative processes is gov-

erned by the requirement that the observed pressure gradients must yield the observed wind velocities. Within broad limits

any model, dry or moist, can be parameterized to yield any desirable rate of wind power generation/dissipation. However, if

indeed wind power is linked to condensation, then models that neglect this relationship – though they may be calibrated to

replicate observed wind velocities – cannot predict circulation intensity, precipitation patterns and other related phenomena

under changing climatic conditions (Bony et al., 2015).

By showing that condensation-induced dynamics can readily explain the magnitude of observed wind power, our work

suggests that in the absence of condensation the atmospheric power on Earth would be substantially smaller. This offers

7Whether latent heat release generates any positive atmospheric power is wholly dependent on the sufﬁciently rapid cooling of the descending air (Goody,

2003). Without such cooling, atmospheric power production from latent heat is impossible.

important insights into regional moisture regimes and the inﬂuence of land cover. Deforestation disturbs terrestrial evaporation

and resulting condensation and diminishes the soil moisture store. One possible effect is changed partitioning between small-

scale atmospheric power generated on the scale of convective eddies and large-scale atmospheric power generated at continental

scale. This would inﬂuence air circulation and the terrestrial water cycle. Such mechanisms may explain the shifts in rainfall

recently observed in world regions affected by deforestation like Brazil and the Mediterranean (Marengo and Espinoza, 2015;

Dobrovolski and Rattis, 2015; Cook et al., 2016). We urge increased attention to the dynamic effects of condensation.

Appendix A: Estimating the enthalpy integral (15), WP (22) and Tc (27)

We follow the approach of Makarieva et al. (2013a). We assume that moist air having temperature Ts and relative humidity 80%
at the surface ﬁrst rises dry adiabatically up to height z1 where water vapor becomes saturated. Then it rises moist adiabatically
to z2, where condensation ceases. At z2 the air preserves share ζ of its initial water vapor content, ζ ≡ γ(z2)/γs = γ(z2)/γ(z1).
Here γ ≡ pv/p, where pv is water vapor partial pressure and p is air pressure. Moist adiabatic distributions of γ(z), T (z) and
p(z) with ps = 1000 hPa were calculated according to Eqs. (A3)-(A5) of Makarieva et al. (2013a).

For Ts ranging from 260 to 310 K and for ζ ranging from 0.001 (complete condensation) to 3/4, we estimated mean
condensation height HP , mean condensation temperature Tc and mean condensation enthalpy per mole hc, Fig. 4 and Table 2:

To ﬁnd the corresponding global mean values we consider the tropics (the area between 30◦S and 30◦N) and the extratropics
separately. The two regions have equal areas. The mean annual temperatures for 2009-2014 at 1000 hPa are 296.5 K and
277 K for the tropics and the extratropics, respectively. Most tropical rainfall is associated with temperatures above 299 K
(Johnson and Xie, 2010; Sabin et al., 2013), so we take Tst = 300 K as a representative value for tropical rainfall. In the
extratropics there is also a tendency for higher rainfall at higher temperature, Fig. 5, we take Tse = 280 K. According to the
Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) version 2.2 dataset, tropical and extratropical precipitation in 2009-2014
was, respectively, Pt = 3.03 mm day−1 and Pe = 2.24 mm day−1. We estimated mean global values of HP , ∆Tc and ∆hc
from Eqs. (A1)-(A3) as

X(ζ) =

X(Tst, ζ)Pt + X(Tse, ζ)Pe

Pt + Pe

.

The results are shown in Table 2.

Assuming that tropical WP t = 1.5 W m−2 according to the TRMM measurements analyzed by Pauluis and Dias (2012), we
conclude from Table 2 that under our assumptions the results with ζ > 0.4 (more than 40% of water vapor does not condense)
corresponding to the global mean WP < 0.75 W m−2 are not realistic. This is smaller than half the tropical average and is
thus impossible. For the same reason our previous estimate WP = 0.8 W m−2, which corresponds to a negligible contribution
from the extratropical rainfall to total gravitational power, appears an underestimate8. The tropical estimate WP t coincides
with the TRMM-derived estimate of Pauluis and Dias (2012) for ζ = 0.2. In this case WP = 1 W m−2. We will thus use the

8The estimate of WP = 0.8 W m−2 was obtained by Makarieva et al. (2013a) from Eq. (22) assuming that HP = 2.5 km is a representative value for
the global average. This height corresponds to the following case: at the surface the ascending air has a global mean surface temperature 288 K and relative
humidity 80%; above the point of saturation it rises with mean tropospheric lapse rate 6.5 K km−1; about one quarter of the water vapor does not condense
and remains in the ascending air, i.e. ζ = 1/4.

The MERRA dataset MAI3CPASM version 5.2.0 was downloaded for the years 2010-2015 (it contains one ﬁle for each day)
from http://mirador.gsfc.nasa.gov. We chose this dataset because it contained the pressure velocity ω necessary for calculating
total atmospheric power. The data are provided for eight times of the day (t = 1, ..., 8): 00, 03, 06, 09, 12, 15, 18 and 21 hours.

The latitude/longitude grid has a resolution of 1.25◦. Latitude coordinate of the grid cell center spans from −90 + 1.25/2 to
90 − 1.25/2 degrees Northern latitude (i = 1, ..., 144). Longitude coordinate of the grid cell center spans from −180 + 1.25/2
to 180 − 1.25/2 degrees Eastern longitude (j = 1, ..., 288). The vertical dimension is represented by 42 ﬁxed pressure levels
(k = 1, ..., 42), from p1 = 1000 hPa to p42 = 0.1 hPa (1000, 975, 950, 925, 900, 875, 850, 825, 800, 775, 750, 725, 700, 650,

day in the studied years we used the following variables Xk(t, i, j): geopotential height H, meridional and zonal velocity v and
u, pressure velocity omega ω, temperature T and the mass fraction of water vapor qv ≡ ρv/ρ. We also used surface pressure
ps(t, i, j). To calculate ∂X/∂t for time t in a given grid cell we used the next (i.e. 3 hours after the considered time point) and
the previous (3 hours before) X values and divided their difference by ∆t = 6 hr.

B1 Calculation of W

The procedure is best illustrated using an example. For example, we are interested in the time point 15.00 (t = 6) on 1 July 2010
for a grid cell with numbers i = 80 (latitude) and j = 100 (longitude). This grid cell is centered at 9.375◦ Northern latitude and
−55.625◦ Eastern longitude and has an area of S(i) = 1.906 × 1010 m2. The atmospheric column is composed of elementary

21

volumes ∆Vk that are enclosed by the neighboring pressure levels k and k + 1:

∆Vk(t, i, j) = S(i)[Hk+1(t, i, j) − Hk(t, i, j)],

(B1)

where Hk(t, i, j) is the geopotential height of the k-th pressure level. For example, for k = 1 (pressure level p1 = 1000 hPa) we
have in the time and place of interest H1 = 125 m, H2 = 348 m and ∆V1 = 4.25 × 1012 m3. The omega value corresponding
to each elementary volume ∆Vk (B1) was calculated as ω = (ωk + ωk+1)/2, i.e. as the average of the omega values at the
neighboring pressure levels deﬁning the elementary volume.

We also need to calculate the contribution of the near surface layer that is enclosed between the pressure levels ps (surface
pressure) and pkmin, where kmin(t, i, j) is the number of the level with maximum pressure for which the data exists for a given
grid cell and time point. For example, in mountainous areas there are no atmospheric layers with k = 1 and p1 = 1000 hPa: in
such areas kmin > 1.

To ﬁnd the vertical thickness ∆z of the surface layer we used the hydrostatic equation ∂p/∂z = −p/H, where H = RT /M g

is the local exponential scale height for air pressure. We estimated the elementary volume ∆Vs(t, i, j) in the surface layer as

∆Vs = S(i)∆z = S(i)

ps − pkmin

.

(B2)

Here Md = 0.0289 kg mol−1 and Mv = 0.018 kg mol−1 are molar masses of dry air and water vapor, respectively. For our cell
(t = 6, i = 80, j = 100) we have kmin = 1, pkmin = p1 = 105 Pa, ps = 101409 Pa, qv1 = 0.0179, M1 = 0.0286 kg mol −1,
T1 = 299.2 K and ∆Vs = 2.38 × 1012 m3.

We now need to ﬁnd the omega value at the surface ωs. (While there are surface data in the MERRA database, they are
provided with a different spatial resolution than in MAI3CPASM.) This can be done in two ways, which should give identical
results in the limit of inﬁnitely small elementary volumes, ∆Vk → 0, but different results for ﬁnite ∆V. The ﬁrst way is to
extrapolate the omega dependence on pressure linearly to the surface assuming that the derivative of omega over pressure does
not change from the surface to the (kmin + 1)-th layer:

ωs − ωkmin
ps − pkmin

=

ωkmin+1 − ωkmin
pkmin+1 − pkmin

.

(B3)

The second way is to assume that at the surface wind velocity is zero, such that ∇ · v = 0 and omega is by deﬁnition equal

to surface pressure tendency, see Eq. (23):

ωs =

∂ps
∂t

.

Finally, the integral of omega over the atmospheric column in each grid cell is given by

Appendix C: Volume integral of pressure tendency

As noted in Section 4, any magnitudes related to vertical velocity, including total atmospheric power W (20), are associated
with signiﬁcant uncertainty. The vertical velocity is usually small compared to horizontal velocity. Rather than being observed

directly, the vertical velocity is estimated from the generally larger horizontal velocities using the continuity equation. Minor

uncertainties in the horizontal components permit major uncertainties in the vertical components.

Pressure velocity (23), which depends on vertical velocity, is calculated using the additional assumption of hydrostatic

equilibrium from the continuity equation in the following form:

∇p · u +

∂ω
∂p

= 0, ω(p) = −

Zps

p

(∇p′ · u)dp′ + ω(ps).

(C1)

Here subscript p at the nabla operator indicates that it is evaluated at constant pressure. For details see, for example, Kasahara
(1974, his Eq. 6.4).

Pressure velocity calculated from Eq. (C1) is apparently not equal to the actual material derivative of pressure dp/dt (5). This
can be illustrated with the following simple example. Consider a dry axisymmetric uniformly heated hydrostatic non-rotating

atmosphere, which experiences slow periodic cooling and warming. In such an atmosphere the surface pressure tendency
∂ps/∂t is always zero (because the amount of gas does not change) and horizontal velocity u is also zero (because of the
spherical symmetry), so ω(ps) = 0. Therefore, according to Eq. (C1), omega must be zero at all heights and at all times.

However, it is clear that for any height z > 0 the instantaneous pressure tendency (and hence the material derivative of
pressure) is not zero: it must reﬂect the temperature variation. In the simplest case when p(z) = ps exp(−z/H), where H =
RT /(M g) is independent of z (an isothermal atmosphere), we have ∂p/∂t = p(z/H2)∂H/∂t. In such an atmosphere the
volume integral of ∂p/∂t = dp/dt is positive when the atmosphere is warming, and negative when it is cooling:

We calculated the global integral of pressure tendency Ψ (B8) for the year 2010. It is shown in Fig. 6a together with
Ω (23), (B6) and WK (21). We can see that Ψ does indeed reﬂect the change of global temperature, Fig. 6b. By absolute

Figure 6. Time series (30-day running mean of daily values for the year 2010) of (a) the global integral of the pressure tendency Ψ (B8),
the omega integral (23) and kinetic power WK (21), cf. Fig. 1; global mean surface temperature (b), global mean surface pressure (c)
and global mean geopotential height at pT = 0.1 hPa (d). This pressure level moves with vertical velocity wT of about 300 m in half a
year, wT ∼ 2 × 10−5 m s−1, which corresponds to IS ∼ pT wT ∼ 10−4 W m−2 ≪ W in Eqs. (8) and (16). Ticks on the horizontal axes
correspond to the 15th day of each month.

magnitude, Ψ constitutes a considerable part (about one quarter) of total long-term atmospheric power W estimated from
pressure velocity. This magnitude is readily derived from Eq. (C2) for a slowly warming/cooling atmosphere. Global mean
temperature T changes by 3◦ or by about 1% in half a year, (1/T )(∂T /∂t) ∼ 6 × 10−10 s−1, Fig. 6b. Global mean surface
pressure changes insigniﬁcantly (by about 0.04% ) over the same period, Fig. 6c. So during the warming phase (the ﬁrst half
of the year) with ps = 105 Pa and H = 104 m we obtain Ψ = 0.6 W m−2. This agrees well with Fig. 6a.

If we formally added the integral of pressure tendency to the integral of omega, see Eq. (16), we would have obtained an

absurd result whereby at certain times of the year total power would have been smaller than kinetic power, Fig. 6a, dashed curve.

25

This illustrates that omega includes only those contributions from the pressure tendency that are associated with macroscopic

air motions and thus non-zero gradients of horizontal velocity, Eq. (C1).

Since the long-term average of Ψ is zero (for the year 2010 we have Ψ = 0.017 W m−2 ≪ W), it does not affect the long-
term mean estimate of W . However, this term can be important for quantifying conversion rates of the available potential
energy to kinetic energy. Different means of calculating pressure tendency, either via Eq. (C1) or via temperature tendency

Eq. (B8) should give different results for these rates (see,e.g., Kim and Kim, 2013).

Generally, Fig. 6 shows that instantaneous values of Ω do not reﬂect the instantaneous values of global atmospheric power
W . Consequently, the difference Ω − WK is not equal to the instantaneous value of the gravitational power of precipitation
WP . This explains why they are not correlated in Fig. 1b.
