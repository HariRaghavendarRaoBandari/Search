SIMPLE HOMOTOPY EQUIVALENCE OF NEARBY

LAGRANGIANS

MOHAMMED ABOUZAID AND THOMAS KRAGH

Abstract. Given a closed exact Lagrangian in the cotangent bundle of a
closed smooth manifold, we prove that the projection to the base is a simple
homotopy equivalence.

1. Introduction

Let N be a closed smooth manifold. In accordance with conjectures of Arnol’d
and Eliashberg, the symplectic topology of the cotangent bundle T ∗N is expected
to be deeply tied to the smooth topology of N . One way to study the symplectic
topology of T ∗N is to consider its Lagrangian submanifolds; symplectic topologists
have traditionally focused on those Lagrangians which are exact with respect to the
canonical Liouville form on the cotangent bundle. The main result of this paper is
the following:

Theorem 1. Let L ⊂ T ∗N be a closed exact Lagrangian. The canonical map
L ⊂ T ∗N → N is a simple homotopy equivalence.

We shall presently explain our strategy for proving this result, after highlighting
the following consequence: recall that a lens space is a quotient of S2n−1 ⊂ C2n
by a ﬁnite cyclic subgroup of U (n). It was classically known following Franz and
Reidemeister that the simple homotopy type of lens spaces determines their diﬀeo-
morphism type (a modern account is provided by Milnor in [9, Section 9]). From
Theorem 1, we therefore conclude an answer to a long-standing open question:

Corollary 1.1. A pair of lens spaces are diﬀeomorphic if and only if their cotangent
bundles are symplectomorphic.
(cid:3)

The proof of Theorem 1 can be broken into three diﬀerent steps: ﬁrst, we in-
troduce a notion of Whitehead torsion for a Floer theoretic equivalence. Here, a
Floer theoretic equivalence should be interpreted as an equivalence in the Fukaya
category of a symplectic manifold, though our usage of this machinery is quite lim-
ited, and we give a self-contained discussion of this notion in terms of the existence
of Floer cocycles whose products satisfy a certain non-degeneracy condition. At a
technical level, the study of torsion invariants for equivalences is a minor generali-
sation of the work of Sullivan [15] and Hutching and Lee [6] whose work considered
the torsion of acyclic Floer complexes. However, we ﬁnd it convenient to provide

our own account for the construction of this invariant, as the speciﬁc context we
are studying allows for greatly simpliﬁed proofs. This is the content of Section 3.

The next step is to appeal to the results of [10, 5, 2, 7] showing that every closed
Lagrangian in a cotangent bundle gives rise to an object of the Fukaya category
which is Floer-theoretically equivalent to the 0-section.
In particular, it makes
sense to consider the torsion of this Floer-theoretic equivalence, and we prove that
this vanishes in Section 4. This section is at the heart of the paper, and the key
idea that it uses is a large-scale Hamiltonian deformation (see also [8]) which allows
us to reduce the computation of torsion to a computation at the level of certain
associated graded groups which admit a particularly simple description.

Finally, we show in Section 5 that the Floer-theoretic torsion which we introduce
agrees, in the setting of cotangent bundles, with the classical torsion. Here, the
main ingredients is the compatibility of Floer and Morse theoretic constructions
in the exact setting, reminiscent of the constructions of Puinikin-Schwarz-Salamon
relating Floer and Quantum cohomology.

From the above ingredients, the proof of Theorem 1 is immediate. We make it

explicit for the record:

Proof. Proposition 5.2 shows that the Whitehead torsion of the map L → N agrees
with the torsion of the Floer theoretic equivalence between L and N . Proposition
4.3 implies that this torsion vanishes.

2. Whitehead Torsion

In this section we give a crash course in Whitehead torsion and Whitehead
groups (more details can be found in [16]). We also prove a lemma about ﬁltrations
and Whitehead torsion which will be needed at several points later. Note that
everything here is formulated in terms of Z-graded chain complexes, but it works
equally well for Z/2 graded complexes (with one exception, which we will point
out).

Let R = Z[G] be the group ring of a discrete group G, and let C∗ = (R[αi], d)
be a ﬁnitely generated acyclic chain complex of left R modules freely generated
by some αi with degree |αi| - we assume that the diﬀerential always increases the
degree. The Whitehead torsion of the pair (C∗, {αi}) is deﬁned as the equivalence
class under the relations generated by

• A very simple expansion given by direct sum with the chain complex

· · · → 0 → R Id−→ R → 0 → · · ·

with the obvious choice of generators.

• A handle slide given by replacing a basis element by itself plus a linear

combination of the other basis elements in the same degree.

• A simple base change given by replacing any αi with (±g)αi for g ∈ G.

These equivalence classes form a group Wh(G) (the Whitehead group of G) under
direct sum. We speak of the Whitehead torsion of a complex when the choice of
basis is self-evident (as it is for Floer, Morse, and simplicial complexes).

SIMPLE HOMOTOPY EQUIVALENCE OF NEARBY LAGRANGIANS

Using the chosen basis (and choosing an auxiliary ordering) we can identify each
diﬀerential with a matrix with coeﬃcients in Z[G]. Whitehead proved in [16] that
using these moves any chain complex is equivalent to one with support in any
two adjacent degrees, and a single non-zero diﬀerential, which then has to be an
isomorphism in Gln(Z[G]). Note, that this does not hold for Z/2 graded complexes;
and therefore the analogue of the Whitehead group in that case can be larger. The
inverse in the Whitehead group is given by the chain complex with the inverse
diﬀerential. Indeed, one can show using simple base changes and handle slides that
the diﬀerential

(cid:18)A
0 A−1(cid:19) ∼(cid:18)AA−1

0

0

0

I(cid:19) = I.

Here ∼ should be interpreted as equality in the Whitehead group between the
two-term chain complexes obtained from the two matrices.

For any chain homotopy equivalence f : (C, dC ) → (D, dD) of left Z[G]-module

chain complexes (with bases) we can deﬁne the mapping cone as

(C[1] ⊕ D, d) =(cid:18)dC [1]

0

f

dD(cid:19)

(with the direct sum basis). Here C[1] means the chain complex shifted up by 1 in
degree and changing the sign on the diﬀerential. This is an acyclic chain complex
and so deﬁnes an element τ (f ) in Wh(G). An important property of this that we
will use repeatedly is that

(2.1)

τ (f ◦ g) = τ (f ) + τ (g)

for the composition of chain homotopy equivalences.

Now let X and Y be ﬁnite CW complexes and f : X → Y a cellular homotopy
equivalence with G = π1(Y ) ∼= π1(X). By considering the universal covering spaces

eX → X and eY → Y with their natural CW structure we get (after a choice of base-

points compatible with f ) an induced chain homotopy equivalence

ef∗ : C∗(eX, Z) → C∗(eY , Z).

Here our convention is that a n-dimensional cell contributes a generator of degree
−n, so that the diﬀerential raises degree as with the rest of the chain complexes we
shall study. Using the choice of base-points and choosing a lift of each cell in X and
Y this lifts to a chain homotopy equivalence of Z[G]-modules complexes (complete
with choices of basis as above)

(X, Z[G]) → C CW

∗

(Y, Z[G]).

∗

ef∗ : C CW

using the mapping cone construction as above. This deﬁnes the Whitehead torsion

τ (f ) = τ (ef∗) ∈ Wh(G) of f . This is well-deﬁned since diﬀerent choices of lifts

of cells corresponds to simple base changes, and so does the choice of base-point
(but it aﬀects many generators simultaneously). The Whitehead torsion of f is
preserved under the notion of a simple expansion of X (or Y ) given by

• A simple expansion is given by attaching the two cells (with positive xn+1)
in an upper half sphere Dn+1 ∩ {xn+1 ≥ 0} by any cellular map Dn → X.
The inverse of this is called s simple contraction. A simple expansion can be divided
into to two moves (after choosing a base-point):

4

M. ABOUZAID AND T. KRAGH

• A very simple expansion given by attaching the two cells by the trivial map
Dn → X. This is the same as wedging with Dn+1 (having two cells and a
base-point).

• A handle slide given by changing any attaching map of a cell to a homotopic
cellular attaching map. By the homotopy extension property this extends
to a homotopy equivalence of X to the new representative of X (well-deﬁned
up to handle slides of the higher dimensional cells).

One can prove that these two generates the same equivalence classes of ﬁnite CW
complexes as the one move above - called the simple homotopy type. However we
are more interested in the relative version for the map f , which asks whether the
map is a simple homotopy equivalence, which is stronger than asking if there is an
abstract simple homotopy equivalence between X and Y . This requires the moves
to be done on the pair (Mf , X) where

Mf = X × I ∪ Y /(x, 1) ∼ f (x)

is the mapping cylinder and X = X × {0} is the sub CW complex. Applying the
moves on a pair (A, B) means applying them to A without changing the sub-space
B, and f is called a simple homotopy equivalence if (Mf , X) ∼ (X, X). Whitehead
proved that this is equivalent to τ (f ) = 0 in the Whitehead group. The reason that
one does not pass to the quotient space Mf /X is that it kills the fundamental group
and thus there are no longer any obstructions for a homotopy equivalence to be a
simple homotopy equivalence. However, one way to think of this as a quotient is to

instead consider the universal covers quotient: gMf /eX which have a free action of π1

(except on the base-point) and the moves are really π1 equivariant moves (adding a
π1 worth of cells at a time), and then the question is whether or not we can perform
such moves to get to the trivial space (consisting of just the base-point).

Whitehead torsion do not generally behave well when it comes to ﬁltrations and
spectral sequences, but we will need the following algebraic lemma, which is a very
special case of using a spectral sequence to compute Whitehead torsion.

Lemma 2.1. Let F pC be a ﬁltered acyclic chain complex (of free based Z[G] left
modules) such that each ﬁltered quotient F pC/F p−1C is free (using a subset of the
same generators), acyclic, and has trivial Whitehead torsion. Then C has trivial
Whitehead torsion.

Note that the condition on the ﬁltration to respect the basis in this way really

means that it is a ﬁltration of the basis elements.

Proof. Since we have ﬁnitely many generators the ﬁltration is ﬁnite (and we may
assume it starts with F 0C = 0). Let k be minimal such that F k+1C = C. We will
prove that C is equivalent in the Whitehead group to F kC and hence the lemma
follows by induction.

Consider the entire chain complex as one module (ignoring degree) and order
the basis such that it starts with the basis elements in the top ﬁltration degree
and descends trough the ﬁltration. This means that the diﬀerential for the entire

SIMPLE HOMOTOPY EQUIVALENCE OF NEARBY LAGRANGIANS

complex can be written in the following upper triangular block form:






where dp is the diﬀerential on F pC/F p−1C. Now since the top quotient F k+1C/F kC
has trivial Whitehead torsion there is a sequence of moves reducing it to the 0 com-
plex. Using the same sequence of moves but expanded by extra handle slides just
before canceling a pair of generators we see that the complex is equivalent in the
Whitehead group to F kC. Indeed, right before we (in the original sequence) do
a cancellation the diﬀerential on the top-left block has a 1 which has only zeros
above, below, to its left and to its right (inside the block). However, to be able
to extend this cancellation to all of C we need to clear the possibles non-zero ele-
ments further to the right of it, but this is easily done by adding an extra handle
slide. Indeed, if this situation represents da = b+(lower ﬁltration terms), where a
and b are generators in the top ﬁltration - then we simply replace b by b+(these
lower ﬁltration terms) and consider this new generator as still being a generator
in top ﬁltration. This way the complex is still ﬁltered in the way speciﬁed by the
lemma.
(cid:3)

The following lemma is not immediately clear from the deﬁnition, but will be
needed to prove perturbation invariance in Floer and Morse theoretic contexts.
However, the lemma should be rather intuitive given the description above of the
moves as G equivariant moves.
Indeed, a Z[G] homotopy is like a G invariant
homotopy, and hence can be realized by a sequence of G invariant simple moves.

Lemma 2.2. If f, g : C∗ → D∗ are chain homotopic maps (as left Z[G]-modules)
then their Whitehead torsions agree.

Proof. Let Φ : C[1] → D be a left Z[G]-module chain homotopy from f to g, i.e. we
have dΦ + Φd = f − g. Then there are sequences of moves showing the equivalence
of the chain complexes

C[1] ⊕ D ∼ C[2] ⊕ C[1] ⊕ C[1] ⊕ D ∼ C[1] ⊕ D

The moves can be obtained as in the proof of Lemma 2.1 by considering the two
canonical two-stage ﬁltrations of the middle complex

C[1] ⊕ D ⊂ C[2] ⊕ C[1] ⊕ C[1] ⊕ D;

the ﬁltrations diﬀer by which factor of C[1] we include (the presence of a 0 entry
above the diagonal ensures that these are both subcomplexes). In both cases, the
ﬁrst quotient F 2/F 1 has no Whitehead torsion (since it is equivalent to the mapping
cone of the identity) so we can proceed to remove it as in the proof of the Lemma
2.1.

3. Whitehead torsion and the Fukaya category

Whitehead groups have been deﬁned and used before in the context of intersec-
tion Floer homology, the work by M. Sullivan in [15] is the most relevant for this
paper (see also [6] which studies a much harder problem). Our treatment will how-
ever be essentially self-contained, in part because we will discuss torsion for Floer
theoretic equivalences, but also because we will only consider such groups in the
exact setting. This means that the action ﬁltration will allow us to use Lemma 2.1
to give a much shorter proof of the invariance of Whitehead torsion. We shall use
Seidel’s book [11] as reference for various points in Lagrangian Floer theory.

3.1. Floer cohomology and the action ﬁltration. We begin by considering the
following context: let (M, λ) be a Liouville domain with symplectic form ω = dλ,

equipped with a grading fGrΛ(M ) and a background class b ∈ H 2(M, Z2). Here, the

grading is a choice of cover of the Grasmannian bundle of Lagrangian subspace in
T M , which restricts over each point in M to a universal cover for the Grasmannian
of linear Lagrangians (see [11, Section 11h]). To simplify the exposition, we shall
assume throughout that b is the second Stiefel-Whitney class of an orientable vector
bundle V on M . In the example of interest, M is the cotangent bundle of a smooth
manifold N , the cotangent ﬁbres lift to a section of the preferred grading and V is
the pullback of T N ⊕ (det N )⊕3, whose second Stiefel-Whitney class is the pullback
of w2(N ).

Consider an exact Lagrangian L which is a brane relative to the background
class b: this means that we ﬁxed a function f : L → R such that df = λ|L, and

L is equipped with a lift to fGrΛ(M ), as well as a Spin structure on the direct

sum of the tangent space with the restriction of the vector bundle V . The ﬁrst
structure implies that the Lagrangian has vanishing Maslov class, and the second
that the second Stiefel-Whitney class agrees with the restriction of b. In the case of
a cotangent bundle, it is clear that the zero section is a brane relative the pullback
of w2(N ).

If (L0, f0) and (L1, f1) are transverse branes, we can associate to each intersection
point x ∈ L0 ∩ L1 a Maslov index deg(x) ∈ Z and a graded one dimensional real
vector space, which we denote ox as in [11, Section 12f] (see also [1, Appendix A]), so
that, whenever J is a generic ω-tame almost complex structure on M , the following
holds: for each pair (x, y) intersection points such that deg(y) + 1 = deg(x), every
element u of the moduli space M(x, y) of J-holomorphic strips induces a canonical
isomorphism

(3.1)

κu : ox → oy.

More precisely, we deﬁne M(x, y) to be the quotient by R-translation of the space
of holomorphic maps from R × [0, 1] to M with boundary conditions L0 along
R × {0} and L1 along R × {1}, with asymptotic conditions x at −∞ × [0, 1] and x
at ∞ × [0, 1].

The Lagrangian Floer cochains are then deﬁned to be the direct sum

(3.2)

CF ∗(L0, L1; Z) = Mx∈L0∩L1

|ox|,

where |ox| is the orientation line of ox (i.e. the free abelian group generated by
the two orientation of this vector space, with the relation that their sum vanishes).

SIMPLE HOMOTOPY EQUIVALENCE OF NEARBY LAGRANGIANS

7

The diﬀerential is the sum, over all u ∈ M(x, y), of the maps on orientation lines
induced by Equation (3.1).

Since we are considering the exact setting, we can associate to each intersection

point its action

An easy consequence of Stokes’s theorem and the fact that R u∗ω is positive when-

ever u is a holomorphic curve is that the moduli space M(x, y) is empty whenever
A(x) ≤ A(y) and x 6= y (see [11, Section 8g]). At the level of Floer complexes, we
obtain a ﬁltration by subcomplexes

(3.3)

A(x) = f1(x) − f0(x) ∈ R.

F aCF ∗(L0, L1; Z) = MA(x)≥a

|ox|.

The reader should keep in mind that, with the conventions we have adopted, the
diﬀerential raises action.

Whenever L = L0 = L1, we follow Biran-Cornea[3], Seidel [12] and Sheridan [13],
and pick a Riemannian metric together with a Morse-Smale function h : L → R
with a unique minimum, and deﬁne

(3.4)

CF ∗(L, L; Z) = CM ∗(L, h; Z)

where the right hand side are Morse cochains. The minimum of h deﬁnes a cocycle
e ∈ CM 0(L, h; Z) which, at the level of cohomology, corresponds to the unit in [e] ∈
H 0(L, Z) under the isomorphism of Morse cohomology with ordinary cohomology.
We set the action ﬁltration on CF ∗(L, L; Z) so that all generators have 0 action.

3.2. The product on Floer cohomology. Given a triple of Lagrangian branes
(L0, L1, L2), which are in transverse position, we have a co-chain map

(3.5)

CF ∗(L1, L2; Z) ⊗ CF ∗(L0, L1; Z)

µ2−→ CF ∗(L0, L2; Z)

given by a count of rigid triangles. More precisely, say that (J01, J12, J02) are
a triple of almost complex structures used to deﬁne the above Floer complexes.
Choosing a (generic) family J of almost complex structures on the disc, which
agrees at three boundary marked points (ordered clockwise) with the above triple,
we obtain a moduli space of M(x0, x1, x2) associates to every triple of intersection
points x0 ∈ L0 ∩ L2, x1 ∈ L0 ∩ L1 and x2 ∈ L1 ∩ L2 as follows: elements of
M(x0, x1, x2) are holomorphic maps from the disc to M , mapping the three marked
points to x0, x1, and x2, with boundary conditions along the boundary given by
the triple of Lagrangians L0, L1 and L2 (see Figure 1). Whenever two of these

Lagrangians agree, we instead count conﬁgurations consisting of holomorphic discs
and (perturbed) gradient ﬂow lines (see Figure 2). Applying this to the special

case when L1 = L2, and two choices of almost complex structures J01 and J ′
obtain a map

01, we

(3.6)

CM ∗(L1, L1; Z) ⊗ CF ∗(L0, L1, J01; Z) −→ CF ∗(L0, L1, J ′

01; Z),

where we temporarily introduce notation which incorporates the choice of almost
complex structure. If we input the class of the minimum in CM ∗(L1, L1; Z), we
obtain a map

(3.7)

CF ∗(L0, L1, J01; Z) −→ CF ∗(L0, L1, J ′

01; Z)

which is a continuation map for almost complex structures.

Lemma 3.1. The continuation map for almost complex structures is a chain iso-
morphism.

Proof. At the chain level, the map is upper triangular with respect to the action
ﬁltration; it suﬃces therefore to show that the entries along the diagonal at ±1.
These entries count constant holomorphic discs at the intersection points of L0 with
L1 (together with a negative gradient ﬂow line to the minimum).
(cid:3)

More generally, one can show that the unit e ∈ HF ∗(L, L; Z) acts as a 2-sided

identity for the product.

The product is part of the A∞ structure on the Fukaya category, as discussed
in [11, Section 12]. We shall only need the fact that it is homotopy commutative.
Concretely, the count of holomorphic discs with boundary mapping to a quadruple
of Lagrangian branes (L0, L1, L2, L3) deﬁnes a homotopy µ3 for the diagram
(3.8)
CF ∗(L2, L3; Z) ⊗ CF ∗(L1, L2; Z) ⊗ CF ∗(L0, L1; Z)

CF ∗(L2, L3; Z) ⊗ CF ∗(L0, L2; Z)

CF ∗(L1, L3; Z) ⊗ CF ∗(L0, L1; Z)

/ CF ∗(L0, L3; Z).

This homotopy again preserves the action ﬁltration.

Deﬁnition 3.2. A pair of Lagrangians L0 and L1 are Floer theoretically equivalent
if there exist cocycles α ∈ CF ∗(L0, L1; Z) and β ∈ CF ∗(L1, L0; Z) such that

(3.9)

(3.10)

[β] · [α] = [e0] ∈ HF ∗(L0, L0; Z)
[α] · [β] = [e1] ∈ HF ∗(L1, L1; Z).

Above, we have used the notation · to denote the map induced by µ2 on coho-

mology. The cycles α and β are called (Floer theoretic) equivalences.

Remark 3.3. Whenever L0 and L1 are connected, the cohomology class of Floer
theoretic equivalences are uniquely determined up to sign, because they induce
isomorphisms

HF ∗(L0, L1; Z) ∼= HF ∗(L0, L0; Z) ∼= HF ∗(L1, L0; Z),

(3.11)
and the group HF ∗(L0, L0; Z) is isomorphic to H ∗(L; Z), which is of course of
rank-1 in degree 0.

Assuming for simplicity that α and β are represented by unique intersection
points x and y, the condition that L0 and L1 are Floer-theoretically equivalent
can be equivalently stated as the fact that the signed count of elements of M(x, y)
whose boundary passes through any ﬁxed point of L0 is 1, as is the count of such
elements passing through a ﬁxed point of L1 (see Figure 3). In the general case,

x

Figure 3. The circled point at the boundary goes through a ﬁxed
point on the Lagrangian.

one requires instead that a linear combination of such counts equal 1.

It follows immediately from the associativity of multiplication at the cohomo-
logical level that Floer theoretic equivalence is transitive. We record a precise
formulation for future use:

Lemma 3.4. If (α1, β1) and (α2, β2) are Floer theoretic equivalences for pairs
(L0, L1) and (L0, L2), then (α2 · α1, β1 · β2) are Floer theoretic equivalences for the
pair (L0, L2).

The most geometric way of producing Floer theoretic equivalences arises from
Hamiltonian isotopies {Kt}t∈[0,1]. In this case, Floer’s invariance result implies [4]
that the Lagrangian Floer cohomology is isomorphic to ordinary cohomology, hence
we have:

(3.12)

HF 0(K0, K1; Z) ∼= Z ∼= HF 0(K1, K0; Z).

If the isotopy is suﬃciently C2-small, a minor variant of Floer’s argument implies
that the product

(3.13)

HF 0(K0, K1; Z) ⊗ HF 0(K1, K0; Z) → HF 0(K0, K0; Z)

is an isomorphism, hence that K0 and K1 are Floer-theoretically isomorphic. De-
composing an arbitrary path into a concatenation of short ones, and using Lemma
3.4, we conclude that any two Hamiltonian isotopic Lagrangians are Floer theoret-
ically equivalent.

Remark 3.5. We note that Floer’s original argument for invariance was rather deli-
cate, using bifurcation analysis at birth-death singularities. This can be replaced by
the most abstract method of continuation maps, or moving Lagrangian boundary

10

M. ABOUZAID AND T. KRAGH

condition [11, Section 8k]: one can deﬁne an cocyle in CF 0(K1, K0; Z) by count-
ing holomorphic discs with boundary conditions given by the path {Kt}t∈[0,1]. A
path of boundary conditions gives a homotopy between the cocyclies deﬁned by its
endpoints, so that the corresponding element of Floer cohomology is well-deﬁned.
The proof that such elements give rise to Floer theoretic isomorphisms amounts to
the fact that the concatenation of a path with the inverse path is homotopic to the
constant path.

3.3. Floer chains with coeﬃcients in the group ring of M . Let us now, ﬁx
a base-point ⋆ ∈ M and consider the local coeﬃcient system R on M whose value
at a point x is the free abelian group Rx on the components of the space of paths
from ⋆ to x. The ﬁbre at the basepoint is the group ring Z[π1(M, ⋆)], which acts
on all other ﬁbres by concatenation. We shall deﬁne a Floer homology group with
values in the coeﬃcient system R.

Given transverse Lagrangian branes L0 and L1 as before, the underlying graded

R module for this vector space is

(3.14)

CF−i(L0, L1; R) = Mx∈K∩L

deg(x)=i

|ox|∨ ⊗ Rx,

where |ox|∨ is the linear dual of the graded line |ox| appearing in Equation (3.2).
The diﬀerential is deﬁned as before by counting rigid elements of moduli spaces of
rigid strips M(x, y), noting that such a map u induces (by concatenation with the
path u(R × {t})) a Z[π1(M, ⋆)]-linear map

Rx → Ry.

Taking the tensor product with the map induced by Equation (3.1) on dual orien-
tation lines, we obtain

∂u : |ox|∨ ⊗ Rx → |oy|∨ ⊗ Ry.

By construction, Floer chains are equipped with a ﬁltration by subcomplexes

(3.15)

F aC∗(L0, L1; R) = Mx∈K∩L

A(x)≤−a

|ox|∨ ⊗ Rx.

We extend this deﬁnition as before to the case L0 = L = L1 by picking a Morse

function h on L, and deﬁning

(3.16)

CF∗(L, L; R) = CM−∗(h; R).

In other words, a generator of this complex corresponds to a choice of a homotopy
class of paths from a critical point of h to the basepoint in M . The ﬁltration on
the self-Floer group is trivial, i.e. supported at the zero level.

The construction of operations on the Fukaya category naturally extends to give
rise to an A∞ bimodule structure on such groups. Of key importance are the ﬁrst
two structure maps (ρ and λ stand for right and left multiplication)
CF ∗(L0, L1; Z) ⊗ CF∗(L0, L2; R) λ−→ CF∗(L1, L2; R)
CF∗(L2, L0; R) ⊗ CF ∗(L1, L0; Z)

ρ
−→ CF∗(L2, L1; R).

These maps are induced by the moduli spaces of holomorphic triangles as follows:
given intersection points x0 ∈ L0 ∩ L2, x1 ∈ L0 ∩ L1 and x2 ∈ L1 ∩ L2, any element
of the moduli space M(x0, x1, x2) determines a canonical homotopy class of paths

from x0 to x2. Left and right multiplication are then deﬁned by taking the tensor
product of the induced map Rx0 → Rx2 with the map induced on orientation lines.
By construction, these are maps of ﬁltered complexes.

The right action is compatible with the product µ2 in the sense that, given a
quadruple (L0, L1, L2, L3), the count of holomorphic discs with 4 marked points
deﬁnes a ﬁltered homotopy in the following diagram:
(3.17)
CF∗(L3, L0; R) ⊗ CF ∗(L1, L0; Z) ⊗ CF ∗(L2, L1; Z)

CF∗(L3, L0; R) ⊗ CF ∗(L2, L0; Z)

CF∗(L3, L1; R) ⊗ CF ∗(L2, L1; Z)

/ CF∗(L3, L2; R).

The left action is similarly compatible via a diagram which we omit. Finally, we
shall use the fact that the left and right actions are homotopically compatible with
each other, i.e. we obtain a bimodule by passing to cohomology. Concretely, this
is given by the homotopy in the diagram
(3.18)
CF ∗(L0, L1; Z) ⊗ CF∗(L0, L3; R) ⊗ CF ∗(L2, L3; Z)

CF∗(L1, L3; R) ⊗ CF ∗(L2, L3; Z)

CF ∗(L0, L1; Z) ⊗ CF∗(L0, L2; R)

/ CF∗(L1, L2; R).

3.4. The torsion of a Floer theoretic equivalence. Consider a pair of con-
nected Lagrangians K and Q, and cocycles α ∈ CF ∗(K, Q; Z) and β ∈ CF ∗(Q, K; Z)
which give rise to a Floer theoretic equivalence.

Using the bimodule structure, we obtain chain homotopy equivalences

(3.19)

(3.20)

λ(α ⊗ −) : CF∗(K, L; R) → CF∗(Q, L; R)
λ(β ⊗ −) : CF∗(Q, L; R) → CF∗(K, L; R)

which are quasi-inverses, and similarly for the maps induced by ρ(− ⊗ α) and
ρ(− ⊗ β).

Deﬁnition 3.6. The Floer-theoretic torsion of a pair (K, L) of Floer-theoretically
equivalent Lagrangians is the torsion of the map

(3.21)

CF∗(L, L; R) → CF∗(K, K; R)

induced by left and right multiplication by equivalences.

Explicitly, if α ∈ CF ∗(L, K; Z) and β ∈ CF ∗(K, L; Z) are equivalences, then we

consider the composition

CF∗(L, L; R)

λ(α⊗−)
−−−−−→ CF∗(K, L; R)

ρ(−⊗β)
−−−−−→ CF∗(K, K; R).

Lemma 3.7. The Whitehead torsion of λ(α ⊗ −) is independent of the choice
of Floer theoretic equivalence and almost complex structure. Similarly for map
ρ(− ⊗ α).

Proof. Changing α to α + dα′: the map λ(α′ ⊗ −) provides a chain homotopy
between λ(α ⊗ −) and λ((α + dα′) ⊗ −), which by Lemma 2.2 does not change
the Whitehead torsion. By Remark 3.3, a Floer theoretic equivalences is uniquely
determined up to sign, which does not aﬀect the torsion.

The continuation map for complex structures is deﬁned using the ﬁrst picture
in Figure 2. The resulting matrix, with respect to the action ﬁltration, is upper
triangular with entries 1 along the diagonal as in the proof of Lemma 3.1. Combined
with Lemma 2.2 we see that the Whitehead torsion of the continuation map is
trivial. Since composing λ(α ⊗ −) with a continuation map gives a chain homotopic
map, Lemma 2.2 and Equation (2.1) prove that the torsion is independent of the
choice of almost complex structure.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.8. The Floer-theoretic torsion is independent of the choice of equiva-
lences and almost complex structures.

3.5. Torsion is Hamiltonian invariant. We shall presently strengthen Lemma
3.12 by showing that torsion is in fact invariant under Hamiltonian isotopies. To
this end, we consider Hamiltonian isotopic Lagrangians K0 and K1, and a ﬁxed
Lagrangian L which is transverse to both. We begin by choosing a generic Hamil-
tonian isotopy {Kt}t∈I so that the following conditions hold:

(1) The Lagrangians Kt and Ks are transverse for almost all (s, t) ∈ I × I.
(2) There are ﬁnitely many t ∈ I for which Kt ∩ L is non-transverse.
(3) For each t ∈ I there are ﬁnitely many points in Kt ∩ L.

Consider an arbitrary member Kt in this isotopy. Choosing ε suﬃciently small, we
may assume that Kt±ε ∩ L is arbitrarily close to Kt ∩ L. In particular, since the
intersection points are isolated, each intersection point of Kt±ε with L is close to a
unique intersection point of Kt with L. We obtain a decomposition:

(3.23)

Kt±ε ∩ L = [x∈Kt∩L

B±
x ,

where B±

x consists of those intersection points which are close to x.

Lemma 3.9. For each t ∈ [0, 1] and δ > 0 which is suﬃciently small, there is a
constant ε so that

• Kt+ε and Kt−ε are δ-close to Kt and mutually transverse, with |A(z)| ≪ δ

for all z ∈ Kt+ε ∩ Kt−ε.

• For any intersection point x± ∈ B±

x , we have |A(x±) − A(x)| ≪ δ.

Proof. Given any t ∈ [0, 1], we can choose ε suﬃciently small so that the La-
grangians (Kt+ε, L, Kt−ε) are pairwise transverse. Since the action and the distance
to an intersection point of L with Kt are continuous in ε, the desired condition can
be achieved for ε suﬃciently small.
(cid:3)

The above result, together with the monotonicity lemma, gives the following

constraint on moduli spaces of holomorphic triangles:

Corollary 3.10. Given distinct intersection points x and y of L and Kt, with
A(x) ≤ A(y), and ε suﬃciently small, the moduli space M(x+, z, y−) is empty for
each z ∈ Kt−ε ∩ Kt+ε, x+ ∈ B+
y . Moreover, there is a contractible
neighbourhood Ux of each intersection point x such that if x± ∈ B±
x then any
element of M(x+, z, x−) is homotopic to a map into Ux relative the two marked
points which map to x+ and x−.

x , and y− ∈ B−

Proof. Choose disjoint neighbourhoods Ux of the intersection points of Kt with L,
so that the conclusion of Lemma A.1 holds for Ux, then choose ε small enough so
that B±

x ⊂ Ux, and the conclusions of Lemma 3.9 hold.

SIMPLE HOMOTOPY EQUIVALENCE OF NEARBY LAGRANGIANS

Whenever x 6= y, Stokes’s theorem implies that the energy of any element of

M(x+, z, y−) is given by

(3.24) A(x+) − A(y−) − A(z) =

(A(x+) − A(x)) + (A(x) − A(y)) + (A(y) − A(y−)) − A(z) ≪ δ,

where the second inequality follows from the conclusion of Lemma 3.9, and the
assumption that A(x) ≤ A(y). On the other hand, Lemma A.1 implies that the
energy must be greater than δ, so the moduli space is empty.

The second statement follows from Corollary A.2.

(cid:3)

We now arrive at the main result of this section:

Proposition 3.11. The Whitehead torsion of a Floer theoretic equivalence of
Hamiltonian isotopic Lagrangians is trivial.

Proof. Choosing a Hamiltonian isotopy as above, it suﬃces to prove that the con-
tinuation map

(3.25)

CF∗(Kt−ε, L; R) → CF∗(Kt+ε, L; R)

has trivial Whitehead torsion.

Consider the action ﬁltration given by the critical values of the action functional.
If c0 < · · · < cd are the values of the action functional on Kt ∩ L, we put a(p) =
− cp−cp−1
(with a(0) > −c0 and a(d + 1) < −cd) and consider the corresponding
action ﬁltration. We write

2

(3.26) GpCF∗(Kt±ε, L; R) ≡ F a(p)CF∗(Kt±ε, L; R)/F a(p+1)CF∗(Kt±ε, L; R)

for the associated graded group. By Corollary 3.10, the chain homotopy equivalence
induced on the quotients

GpCF∗(Kt−ε, L; R) → GpCF∗(Kt+ε, L; R)

splits as a direct sum - one for each of the original intersection points in Kt ∩ L.
Moreover, there is a ﬁxed contractible set which contains the image (up to homotopy
relative the essential marked points) of each holomorphic triangle which contributes
to the map of associated graded spaces. This means that the continuation map on
these quotients can be identiﬁed with the standard continuation map

GpCF∗(Kt−ε, L; Z) → GpCF∗(Kt+ε, L; Z)

tensored with R (and multiplication with the identity) - hence it has trivial White-
head torsion. So, Lemma 2.1 shows that the entire continuation map in Equa-
tion (3.25) has trivial torsion.
(cid:3)

The above result has the following straightforward generalisation:

Corollary 3.12. The Whitehead torsions of Equation (3.19) and (3.20) are in-
variant under Hamiltonian isotopy of K, L and Q.

14

M. ABOUZAID AND T. KRAGH

Proof. Let L0 and L1 be Hamiltonian isotopic. As a special case of Equation (3.18),
we have a chain homotopy commutative diagram

CF∗(K, L0; R)

where the vertical maps are the continuation maps considered in Lemma 3.11
which up to homotopy do not depend on the choice of β ∈ CF 0(L0, L1; Z). Using
Lemma 3.11, Lemma 2.2 and Equation (2.1) we see that the two horizontal maps
have the same Whitehead torsion.

Changing K or Q involves slightly diﬀerent diagrams:

CF∗(K, L; R)

CF∗(Q0, L; R)

(◗◗◗◗◗◗◗◗◗◗◗◗

but the conclusion is the same since in each case the additional map has trivial
torsion by Lemma 3.11, and the diagrams homotopy commute by using Equation
(3.17) and its analogue for the left module action.
(cid:3)

4. The Floer-theoretic torsion vanishes

In this section we specialise to the setting of cotangent bundles: recall that, if N
is a closed manifold, every closed exact Lagrangian in T ∗N is Floer-theoretically
equivalent to the 0-section ([10, 5, 2, 7]). Our main result will be the following:

Proposition 4.1. If L ⊂ T ∗N is an exact Lagrangian, then the torsion of the
Floer-theoretic equivalence with the 0-section vanishes.

We shall prove this result by appealing to the Hamiltonian invariance of tor-
sion and a large-scale deformation of the Lagrangian L. The deformation of L is
essentially the same as that used in [8].

Denote by ψr the time log r Liouville ﬂow (which corresponds to dilating the
ﬁbres by r), and by φg the Hamiltonian ﬂow of g ◦ q, where g : N → R is a Morse
function with distinct critical values. We deﬁne

(4.1)

Lr= ψrL
Lr

1= φgLr,

and note that Corollary 3.12 implies that the Floer theoretic torsion of the equiv-
alence of L with the zero section agrees with the torsion of the map

CF∗(Lr, Lr

(4.2)
induced by left and right multiplication with Floer theoretic equivalences αr ∈
CF ∗(Lr, N ) and βr
1 ∈ CF ∗(Lr
1, N1), noting the fact that N is invariant under the
Liouville ﬂow, hence N r = N .

1; R) → CF∗(N, N1; R),

By construction, intersection points of N and N1 occur at critical points of g,
and A(x) = −g(x). In particular, if −cd < · · · < −c0 are the critical values of g
then we consider the action ﬁltration

using the actions a(p) = − cp−cp−1
of action cp implies that the associated graded group is

, the fact that there is a unique intersection xp

(4.4)

GpCF∗(N, N1; R) ∼= Rxp.

We shall now assume that r ≪ 1 in which case we have:

• The cocycles αr and βr
• The intersection points of Lr and Lr

1 are supported in action level ≪ 1.

(4.5)

(4.6)

We now consider the ﬁltration on CF∗(Lr, Lr

1; R) given by the same action levels
as the above ﬁltration on CF∗(N, N1; R), i.e. cp−cp−1
. The pth associated graded
group is generated by intersection points of action between cp−cp−1
and cp+1−cp
.
By Equation (4.6), all such intersection points in fact have action approximately
equal to cp and lie in the set Br
p of intersection points which are close to xp. This
associated graded group is therefore given by

and is equipped with the induced diﬀerential.

Since left and right multiplication induce maps which preserve action ﬁltrations,
and the equivalences αr and βr
1 have small action, we conclude that Equation (4.2)
descends to the associated graded with respect to the ﬁltration, as does the chain
homotopy inverse induced by multiplication with the quasi-inverses of αr and βr
1.
We conclude:

Lemma 4.2. The equivalences αr and βr

1 induce a chain homotopy equivalence

(4.8)

GpCF∗(Lr, Lr

1; R) → GpCF∗(N, N1; R).

(cid:3)

On the other hand, Equation (4.8) agrees with the map obtained from

(4.9)

GpCF∗(Lr, Lr

1; Z) → GpCF∗(N, N1; Z)

by extension of scalars from Z to R. Indeed, using Corollary A.2 with K = N and
Q = N1, we see (as in the proof of Proposition 3.11) that the homotopy class of
the path deﬁned by any rigid disc counted in these maps is homotopic relative to
end points to a path inside a small contractible neighbourhood of xp.

In particular, the Whitehead torsion of Equation (4.8) vanishes. Since this is the
map on associated graded groups of Equation (4.2), we conclude from Lemma 2.1
that the Whitehead torsion vanishes. Using invariance of torsion under Hamiltonian
isotopies, we arrive at the main result of this section:

Proposition 4.3. The Whitehead torsion of any Floer-theoretic equivalence of
closed exact Lagrangians in T ∗N vanishes.
(cid:3)

16

M. ABOUZAID AND T. KRAGH

5. From cellular to Floer cochains

In this section, we prove that the Whitehead torsion of the projection map
L → N , which we call the classical torsion, agrees with the Floer theoretic torsion.
We will prove this by passing through a sequence of intermediary maps which are
deﬁned using Morse and Floer theory in disc cotangent bundle D∗N ⊂ T ∗N (which
we assume contains L in its interior).

On the Morse theoretic side, we consider the following speciﬁc context:

let
h : L → R be any Morse function on L, which we extend to a small tubular
neighborhood of L inside D∗N by

(5.1)

H(z) = h(π(z)) + dL(z)2

where dL(−) denotes the distance to L with respect to some Riemannian metric on
D∗N , and π(z) is the nearest point to z in L. Each critical point of h gives rise to a
critical point of H whose descending manifolds agree (i.e. the descending manifolds
with respect to H are contained in L). Extend this to a Morse function H : D∗N →
R which has outwards pointing gradient at the boundary, we conclude that the
Morse complex CM∗(L, H; R) embeds as a sub-complex into CM∗(D∗N, H; R).

Lemma 5.1. The classical torsion agrees with the torsion of the inclusion

(5.2)

CM∗(L; h, R) → CM∗(D∗N ; H, R).

Proof. We ﬁrst use the factorisation

(5.3)
to see that the classical torsion agrees with the torsion of the map L → D∗N we
note that the second map has trivial torsion since D∗N has a sequence of simple
collapses to N .

L → D∗N → N,

We now appeal to the fact that union of the descending manifolds of H yield a

CW subcomplex XD∗N → D∗N , so that we obtain a further factorisation
(5.4)
We claim that the inclusion XD∗N → D∗N has trivial torsion. Indeed, this is in fact
a sequence of trivial expansions, as can be seen by deforming the Morse function
H outside a compact set so that its restriction to a neighbourhood of ∂D∗N agrees
with

L → XD∗N → D∗N.

f (π(z)) − d∂D∗N (z),

(5.5)
with f a Morse function on ∂D∗N . The descending manifolds give rise to a cell-
decomposition of D∗N as XD∗N with two extra cells attached for each critical point
of f . This collapses to XD∗N by starting with the top dimensional cells and going
down in dimension. Combining the above arguments, we conclude that the torsion
of L → N agrees with the torsion of L → XD∗N .

To complete the argument, we observe that the map L → XD∗N is cellular
with respect to the Morse-theoretic CW structure on L, and we have a natural
commutative diagram

(cid:3)

We have arranged our ﬁxed choice of pair of Morse functions so that Equation
(5.2) is an inclusion. This inclusion can also be interpreted as a count of conﬁgu-
rations shown in Figure 4, which consist of: (1) a ﬂow line γ− of h parametrised
by (−∞, 0] (2) a ﬂow line γ+ of H parametrised by [0, ∞), and (3) holomorphic
map u : D2 → M mapping the boundary to L, such that u(−1) = γ−(0) and
u(0) = γ+(0). The key point is that all such rigid conﬁgurations are constant: the
exactness of L implies that all holomorphic discs are constant, and Equation (5.1)
implies that all negative gradient ﬂow lines of H starting on L are contained in L.

Proof. Consider the composition

CM∗(L; h, R)

ρ

−→ CF∗(L, N ) λ−→ CM∗(N, N ; R) m−→ CM∗(D∗N ; H, R)

By Lemma 5.1 the last map has trivial Whitehead torsion. Indeed, the standard
inclusion N ⊂ D∗N has trivial Whitehead torsion. The proposition will thus
follow from the claim that the composition of these is homotopic to the map from
Lemma 5.1, which is represented in Figure 4.

Let α ∈ CF ∗(L, N ) and β ∈ CF ∗(N, L) be Floer cochains inducing the Floer
theoretic equivalences, and let f : N → R be any Morse function on N which has
generic intersection of its stable manifolds with the unstable manifolds of H. The
maps in the sequence are given by counting rigid objects in moduli spaces of maps
as in Figure 5.

Here marked points on the boundary of a disc should be mapped to an intersec-

To create a homotopy between the two maps we construct a 1-parameter family
of moduli spaces, parametrised by s ∈ [−1, 1], interpolating between Figures 5 and

• Near s = −1, we glue the ﬂow lines in the right and center of Figure

has dimension 2.

• For 0 < s < 1 we pick a path in the moduli space of such discs, as shown
in Figure 8, between the conﬁguration appearing at s = 0, and the conﬁg-

equivalences α and β.

In this way, we have produced a homotopy between the composition appearing in
Equation (5.7), and the map deﬁned by the moduli spaces for s = 1. Since α and
β are Floer theoretic equivalences, the (signed) count of holomorphic bigons with
corners labelled α and β passing thought a generic point of L is 1. This implies
that the (signed) count of conﬁgurations shown in Figure 9 is the same as the count
of the moduli space appearing in Figure 4, which, by Lemma 5.1, agrees with the
classical torsion. Note in particular that each contribution to the local coeﬃcient
system is the same since this is given by the path (unique up to homotopy) from
the far left of the diagram to the marked point at the end of the arrow decorated
with H.

Appendix A. The monotonicity Lemma

Let M be any symplectic manifold (possibly non-compact) with a given almost
complex structure J, and let K and Q be two proper Lagrangians in M with an
isolated intersection point x ∈ K ∩ Q.

Let Ux be a neighbourhood of x, and consider J-holomorphic discs u : D2 → M

which satisfy the following conditions with respect to a constant 0 < δ:

(A.1)

(A.2)

u(1) ∈ Ux and u(−1) /∈ Ux
u maps the upper semi-circle in ∂D2 to a δ neighbourhood of K, and
the lower semi-circle to a δ neighbourhood of Q.

The following technical result about minimal areas of holomorphic curves is a vari-
ant of the monotonicity Lemma, and is crucially used in Sections 3 and 4:

Lemma A.1. For each suﬃciently small neighborhood Ux, there is a constant δ
such that all holomorphic discs satisfying the Conditions (A.1) and (A.2) have area
greater than δ.

Proof. Pick a Darboux chart D2n
ε → M mapping the origin to x such that Q
is identiﬁed with Dn
ε , and such that the image of the tangent space of K at x
has trivial intersection with iRn (i.e.
is non-vertical). Locally K is given by the
diﬀerential of a function, and by making ε smaller we may assume that f : Dn
ε → R
is such a function, and that the diﬀerential deﬁnes K in a neighborhood of the type
Dn

ε × iDn
ε′ .

20

M. ABOUZAID AND T. KRAGH

Since f has an isolated critical point at 0, we have a co-dimension 2 manifold

W = {(q, p) ∈ Dn

ε × iDn

ε′ | kqk = ε/2, kpk = kdqf k/2}

which is an Sn−1 bundle over the sphere of radius ε/2 in Rn.

We shall presently appeal to the monotonicity Lemma [14, Proposition 4.4.1]:
there is a constant C so that any holomorphic curve which intersects W and has
boundary in the complement of the C · A neighbourhood of W has area greater
than A, whenever A is suﬃciently small.

Let us therefore choose some neighbourhood U of x which is disjoint from W ,

and pick δ so that the following properties hold in the Darboux chart:

(1) The δ neighbourhoods of Q and K are disjoint away from U .
(2) The Cδ neighbourhood of W is disjoint from U and from the δ neighbour-

hoods of Q and K.

The ﬁrst assumption implies that u(−1) lies outside of the chart. The image of the
boundary of u under the collapse map M → D2n
is therefore a loop which
winds once around W . The algebraic intersection number of u with W is hence
non-trivial modulo 2. The image of u therefore intersects W , while the image of
its boundary lies outside the Cδ-neighbourhood of W . The monotonicity Lemma
implies that such a curve has area greater than δ, completing the proof.
(cid:3)

ε /∂D2n
ε

We shall also consider the following variant:

Corollary A.2. For each suﬃciently small neighbourhood of x, there is a constant
δ such that, if Condition (A.2) holds, the image of ±1 under u lie in Ux, and the
area of u is less than δ, then the path {u(t)}t∈[−1,1] is homotopic relative its end
points to a map with image in Ux.

Proof. Assume by contradiction that there is such a disc for which the path from
u(−1) to u(1) is not homotopic to a path with image in Ux, we then see that the lift
of u to the universal cover of M has endpoints mapping to distinct inverse images
of Ux. Replacing K and Q by their inverse images, we ﬁnd a contradiction to the
previous Lemma.
