ABSTRACT
We propose an analytic model for the normal YORP and diurnal Yarkovsky eﬀects
experienced by a convex asteroid. Both the YORP torque and the Yarkovsky force are
expressed as integrals of a universal function over the surface of an asteroid. Although
in general this function can only be calculated numerically from the solution of the
heat conductivity equation, approximate solutions can be obtained in quadratures for
important limiting cases. We consider 3 such simpliﬁed models: Rubincam’s approx-
imation (zero heat conductivity), low thermal inertia limit (including the next order
correction and thus valid for small heat conductivity), and high thermal inertia limit
(valid for large heat conductivity). All three simpliﬁed models are compared with the
exact solution.

Key words: minor planets, asteroids, general

1 INTRODUCTION

The Yarkovsky–O’Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack (YORP) ef-
fect alters the rotation rate of asteroids and the orientations
of their rotation axes (Rubincam 2000; Bottke et al. 2006;
Vokrouhlick´y et al. 2015). The vector of the YORP torque
has 3 components. The ‘axial’ component of YORP Tz ac-
celerates or decelerates the asteroid’s rotation, changing its
angular velocity ω. The ‘obliquity’ component Tε turns the
rotational axis, changing the obliquity ε. The third, ‘preces-
sion’ component TΨ causes the precession of the asteroid’s
axis (Bottke et al. 2006). For large asteroids this contribu-
tion is negligible compared to gravitational tides that also
cause precession ( ˇCapek & Vokrouhlick´y 2004), however for
100-meter sized asteroids TΨ can already dominate over the
tides.

Initial studies of YORP calculated the eﬀect via inte-
grating the torque over the surface of an asteroid and then
averaging it over time (Rubincam 2000; Vokrouhlick´y &
ˇCapek 2002), but later it was found more convenient for
some applications to change the order of the procedures,
ﬁrst averaging the force acting on a surface element over
time and only then integrating the force over the surface.
Scheeres (2007) used this approach in his approximate ana-
lytic consideration of YORP, and Breiter et al. (2009) used
it in their numeric simulations of asteroid 25 143 Itokawa.

Golubov & Krugly (2010) constructed in this manner an ex-
act analytic theory for the axial component of YORP. They
performed averaging over time in quadratures, and thus the
YORP acceleration was expressed as an integral over the
surface of an asteroid of an analytic function pz depending
on only 2 free parametres, namely the latitude ψ and the
obliquity ε. Golubov & Krugly (2010) limited their analysis
to the axial component of YORP Tz, but Steinberg & Sari
(2011) applied the same methods to get the obliquity com-
ponent Tε and the precession component TΨ. An important
drawback of Golubov & Krugly (2010) and Steinberg & Sari
(2011) was that both conducted their analysis under the as-
sumption of zero thermal inertia of the surface. Although
this assumption makes no diﬀerence for the computation of
Tz, which is independent of thermal inertia at all, Tε strongly
depends on thermal inertia ( ˇCapek & Vokrouhlick´y 2004).

In this article we generalize these results for the case of
non-zero thermal inertia. For a convex asteroid we express
Tε and TΨ as integrals over the asteroid’s surface. Two uni-
versal functions psin and pcos, participating in the integrals,
incorporate all the necessary information about the thermal
model of the asteroid. In contrast to the function pz, they
depend on three parametres, thermal inertia of the surface
θ being the third.

We ﬁnd functions psin and pcos by numerically solving
the heat conductivity equation. Also we consider limiting
cases of very large and very small thermal inertia of the
surface, and develop approximate methods to get solutions

ordinate system is centred at the centre of the asteroid, but does
not rotate with it and moves only translationally. Oz is the rota-
tion axis of the asteroid, Oxy is its equatorial plane. γ stands for
the point of the spring equinox of the asteroid. ε is the obliquity of
the asteroid, the angle between its equatorial and orbital planes.
υ is the angle between the equinox γ and the vector s directed
from the asteroid towards the Sun, and υ corresponds to the time
of the year on the asteroid. In the course of the asteroid’s mo-
tion around the Sun, the angle υ changes, and the vector s circles
around the orbit as it is shown in the ﬁgure with an ellipsis.

in these cases analytically. The case of zero heat conductivity
corresponds to Rubincam’s approximation.

In Section 2 we introduce basic equations describing
the YORP and Yarkovsky eﬀects. We determine the ther-
mal model of the asteroid, derive general expressions for
the YORP and Yarkovsky forces created by a surface el-
ement, and ultimately deﬁne the overal YORP torque and
the Yarkovsky force as integrals over the surface of the aster-
oid. We express the YORP and Yarkovsky forces as integrals
of non-dimensionalized temperature, which is in turn to be
determined from a partial diﬀerential equation with a non-
linear boundary condition. We call these integrals p with
corresponding indices, as physically they mean diﬀerently
averaged non-dimensionalized pressure. All these integrals p
appear to depend solely on three free parametres, and once
parameterized, can be applied to any convex asteroid.

Then in Section 3 we propose three simple analytical
models to estimate the expressions for p derived in the pre-
vious section. Rubincam’s approximation is valid in the case
of zero heat conductivity, the low thermal inertia limit im-
plements a correction for small non-zero heat conductivity,
and the high thermal inertia limit is valid if heat conductiv-
ity is very large.

In Section 4 we present results of our numeric computa-
tions of integrals p, study how these depend on all three free
parametres, and compare them with analytical expressions
from Section 3.

All these results are obtained under several essential
limitations: the asteroid is assumed convex, its orbit circu-
lar, and light scattering Lambertian. In Section 5 we discuss
importance of these limitations and possibilities of their sur-
pression.

2 GENERAL THEORY

2.1 Heat model

Assuming that on scales essential for heat conductivity the
asteroid is large and its surface is ﬂat, temperature under

ement with respect to the coordinate system. ψ is latitude of
the surface element, determined as the angle between the normal
vector n and the equatorial plane Oxy of the asteroid. The angle
φ between Ox axis and the projection of n onto the plane Oxy
corresponds to the sidereal time of the surface element. With the
lapse of time the angle φ changes, and the vector n rotates around
the axis Oz.

the surface is governed by the heat conductivity equation in
a semispace (Lagerros 1996),

(2.1)

Here T (Z, t) is temperature, t is time and Z is height above
the ground, so that the semi-space under consideration is
Z (cid:54) 0. Heat conductivity of the material constituting the
asteroid surface is κ, its heat capacity is C, and its density
is ρ.

Equation (2.1) requires two boundary conditions and
one initial condition. The boundary condition on the surface
of the asteroid is

= E (t) − εσ T 4

.

The left-hand side and the second term in the right-hand
side are related to the surface of the asteroid, Z = 0.
E (t) is the radiation ﬂux absorbed by the asteroid’s sur-

is the ﬂux irradiated by the surface, with

thermal emissivity ε and the Stefan–Boltzmann constant σ.
For the second boundary condition, we assume that the as-
teroid is suﬃciently big and ﬂat for the heat ﬂux in its depth
to vanish,

(2.3)

Finally, instead of the initial condition we assume periodicity
of the solution,

.

(2.4)

This periodic solution is attained if rotation of the asteroid
around its axis is much faster than its rotation around the
Sun, that holds in almost all cases. Boundary condition in
the form of Eqn. (2.4) removes from our consideration such
eﬀects as seasonal temperature waves and variations of day
length for eccentric orbits.

The absorbed radiation ﬂux in Eqn. (2.2) is determined
by the relative orientation of the Sun and the surface ele-
ment. Unit vector s directed towards the Sun is

s = (cos υ, cos ε sin υ, sin ε sin υ) ,

where ε is obliquity, i.e. inclination of the asteroid’s equator
to its orbit, and υ is the angle between the equinoctial point
and the direction towards the Sun (the solar true anomaly).

Normal vector n of the element dS is given by

where ψ is the angle between the normal vector n and the
equatorial plane (x, y), and φ is the angle between x axis
and projection of n on the plane (x, y). φ can be thought as
sidereal time.
dence angle of the radiation s · n is given by
s · n = cos ψ cos φ cos υ+

According to Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6), cosine of the inci-

(2.7)

Therefore, the absorbed radiation ﬂux is
E (t) = (1 − A) Φ α,

(2.8)

where A is the albedo of the surface, Φ is solar radiation
ﬂux at the asteroid’s orbit, and the dimensionless radiation
ﬂux α is given by
α =(s · n) · H(s · n),

(2.9)

with H standing for the Heaviside step function.

Let us introduce new dimensionless variables. It is ap-
propriate to scale time to the rotation period, depth to the
thermal wave length, and temperature to the equilibrium
temperature for subsolar point, thus introducing

Finally, we average Eqn. (2.12) over time, substitute Eqn.
(2.17) into its right-hand side, and get

(cid:10)τ 4(cid:12)(cid:12)ζ=0

(cid:11) = (cid:104)α(cid:105).

(2.18)

This equation implies that the mean energy emitted by the
surface equals the mean energy absorbed by the surface.

2.2 Instantaneous YORP torque

The total recoil force df experienced by each surface element
consists of three parts: df i produced by the incident solar
light, df s produced by solar light scattered by the surface,
and df e produced by the infrared light emitted by the heated
asteroid’s surface.

The ﬁrst component, df i, is proved to produce no net
YORP torque (Rubincam & Paddack 2010). So further on
we disregard the direct solar light pressure df i.

The expression for the second component depends on
the scattering law used. The simplest and most widely used
assumption is Lambert’s scattering law. It assumes no de-
pendence on the direction of the incident light, and intensity
of the emitted light proportional to cosine of the angle with
the normal. Under such assumptions, we get
f s = − 2AΦ
3c

(2.19)

αdS.

The coeﬃcient 2/3 is caused by Lambert’s scattering indi-
catrix.

The ultimate term, which acts on the surface element

due to re-emission of infrared light, is

dS =

T 4(cid:12)(cid:12)Z=0

τ 4(cid:12)(cid:12)ζ=0

dS.

(2.20)

We again assume Lambert’s indicatrix, which results in the
same coeﬃcient 2/3.

To compute the YORP torque, take the cross product
of the radius-vector r of the element dS with the recoil force
df s + df e. The radius-vector is

r = r (cos η cos (φ + ∆), cos η sin (φ + ∆), sin η) ,

(2.21)

where η is the angle between the radius-vector r and the
plane (x, y), and ∆ is the angle between projections of r
and n onto the plane (x, y).

Thus the torque dT created by the recoil force acting

upon the surface element dS, is given by the formula

(Aα + (1 − A)τ 4(cid:12)(cid:12)ζ=0

dT =

2ΦdS

(2.22)

The dimensionless thermal parameter θ participating in the
boundary condition is deﬁned as

θ =

(cρωκ)1/2

(εσ)1/4 (1 − A)3/4 Φ3/4

.

(2.15)

It expresses the relative importance of thermal inertia of the
surface. If θ (cid:28) 1, then the left-hand side in Eqn. (2.12) is
unimportant, and the surface aquires the equillibrium tem-
perature almost instantly, without any signiﬁcant thermal
lag. In the opposite case, if θ (cid:29) 1, the thermal lag is so
large, that the surface temperature barely changes at all
throughout a rotation period.

It is more convenient to transform Eqn. (2.13) into a
diﬀerent form. First we integrate Eqn. (2.11) over φ from 0

c(cid:13) 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, L1–L14

4 Golubov et al.

This torque rapidly changes as the asteroid rotates. To
study the secular evolution we must average dT over time.
If spin and orbital periods are non-commensurate, this is
equivalent to separate averaging over spin phase φ and or-
bital phase υ. This averaging is carried out in the next two
subsections, ﬁrst for the axial component dTz, and then for
the obliquity component dTε and the precession component
dTΨ. Such separation is convenient because of some essen-
tial simpliﬁcations, which can be done only for the axial
component.

(2007) in a simpliﬁed model of YORP with a constant ther-
mal lag, by Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y (2008) in a linearized
heat conductivity model, and by Breiter et al. (2010a) via
Fourier decomposition of heat conductivity equation. Al-
though the latter proof is already general enough, we ﬁnd
our proof more straightforward. Here we have proved axial
YORP independence of the thermal model only for a convex
asteroid and Lambert’s scattering law. A more general proof
of this fact is given in Appendix A.

with φ and υ cancel, so that dTz depends on time only via

(2.26)

Equations (2.25) and (2.26) were previously derived by

Golubov & Krugly (2010) and Steinberg & Sari (2011).

An important and robust by-product of our analysis is
that the axial component of YORP does not depend on the
thermal model of the surface, and is determined purely ge-
ometrically. This result is physically very sensible: for a big
locally ﬂat asteroid all energy obtained by a surface element
is eventually emitted by the same surface element, and what-
ever the time lag for this emission is the lever arm around
the rotation axis stays the same, thus the mean axial torque
depends solely on the mean absorbed power. This does not
hold for the obliquity component of YORP, whose lever arm
alters during rotation period of the asteroid, thus the time
lag between absorption aand re-emission matters.

The fact that the axial component of YORP is inde-
pendent of the thermal model was ﬁrst spotted in numerical
simulations by ˇCapek & Vokrouhlick´y (2004), although the
authors were hesitant to acknowledge generality of their re-
sult. Later this result was proved theoretically by Scheeres

These equations must be averaged over φ and υ. This
will lead to terms proportional to α cos φ vanishing, which
can be seen by performing the transformation φ → π − φ,
υ → π − υ: physically it should not aﬀect the result as we
still average over the same domain of φ and υ; but, on the
other hand, this transformation changes sign of cos φ while
conserving α, and thus should change sign of (cid:104)α cos φ(cid:105). It is
possible only if (cid:104)α cos φ(cid:105) = 0. Thus after averaging over φ

2.5 Yarkovsky force

A similar method can be used to get the diurnal compo-
nent of the Yarkovsky force created by the surface element.
The force produced by the incident solar light df i gives no
contribution to the Yarkovsky force, as the impinging solar
photons carry momentum in the radial direction only, and
thus can not change the angular momentum of the aster-
oid with respect to the Sun. The remaining two forces df s
and df e given by Eqs. (2.19) and (2.20) respectively must
be projected on the direction of the asteroid’s orbital mo-
tion, and then averaged over time. The normal of the orbit
is norb = (0,− sin ε, cos ε). The direction of the asteroid’s
motion is s × norb. So we must average the mixed product
(f s + f e) · (s × norb) over φ and υ, thus getting

The dimensionless temperature τ must be deﬁned from Eqn.
(2.11), which is a partial diﬀerential equation with boundary
condition Eqn. (2.12), where the expression for α from Eqn.
(2.9) must be substituted. One can see that according to
these equations psin and pcos depend only on 3 parameters:
the latitude ψ of the surface element, the obliquity ε of the
asteroid, and the thermal parameter θ.

Similarly to Eqn. (2.26), we can perform integration

over υ, thus transforming Eqn. (2.31) into

Equation (2.34) is also equivalent to the one derived
by Steinberg & Sari (2011), but Eqs. (2.32) and (2.33) de-
pend on the thermal model, which can substantially alter
the result.

mation φ → π+φ−2 arctan(cos ε tan υ), υ → π−υ. Its phys-
ical meaning is that we are considering the season with the
same day length (with the equal number of days before and
after solstice), and the same time of day. The formula for φ
is complicated because angle υ measured in the orbital plane
must be projected onto the equatorial plane. This transfor-
mation is just a translation in φ, so it conserves ∂/∂φ. It
also conserves α, which has a lenthy algebraic proof, but is
also pretty evident geometrically. So Eqs. (2.11) and (2.12)
are invariant under this transformation. It implies that their
periodic solution τ is also conserved. But cos υ changes its

and therefore must be 0.

To get the overal YORP torque and Yarkovsky force acting
on an asteroid, we must integrate Eqs. (2.24), (2.29), (2.30),

3 APPROXIMATE ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS

Equations (2.38)-(2.41) express the YORP torque and the
Yarkovsky force in terms of several universal functions. In
general case, these functions must be obtained from a nu-
meric solution of the heat conductivity equation. But in
several important general cases they can be expressed in
quadratures.

3.1 Zero thermal inertia

This approximation was ﬁrst used by Rubincam (2000), and
now it is often called Rubincam’s approximation. It corre-
sponds to instant re-emission of absorbed light by the aster-
oid’s surface.
To obtain Rubincam’s approximation from our general
approach, we must consider limiting case θ → 0. Then the
left-hand side of Eqn. (2.12) vanishes, reducing it to

that uniquely determines the surface temperature in the ab-
sence of conduction.

We substitute the expression for τ into Eqs. (2.32),
(2.33), (2.37), simplify the results similarly to the previous
section, and obtain

3.2 Low thermal inertia
Now, instead of substituting θ = 0, we will assume θ (cid:28) 1,
and treat θ as a small parameter, solving Eqs. (2.11) and
(2.12) perturbatively.

So, at ﬁrst we disregard the left-hand side of Eqn. (2.12),
and solve Eqn. (2.11) with the boundary condition Eqn.
(3.1). The solution is a Fourier series

Substituting Eqn. (3.5) in the left-hand side of Eqn.
(2.12), we obtain the corrected expression for the surface
temperature. Then we substitute this temperature into Eqs.
(2.32), (2.33) and (2.37). All terms except for the ones with
n = 1 vanish after integration. Substituting Eqn. (2.9) into
Eqn. (3.6), one can see that A1 = 0. Therefore B1 is the only
Fourier coeﬃcient contributing to the result, and we get

In the limiting case θ = 0 Eqs. (3.7)-(3.9) reduce to
Eqs. (3.2)-(3.4). In Eqn. (3.7) the ﬁrst-order term derived
in this subsection represents a correction to the zero-order
term from Rubincam’s approximation, while in Eqs. (3.8)-
(3.9) the ﬁrst-order terms proportional to θ are the ﬁrst
non-vanishing terms. Interestingly, the ﬁrst-order terms in
Eqs. (3.7) and (3.8) are the same.

In principle, it is possible to further extend the series in
terms of θ. One might substitute the obtained solution for τ
back into Eqn. (2.12), equate coeﬃcients of diﬀerent Fourier
harmonics, and ﬁnd the next correction, proportional to θ2,
and so on. The cost for better accuracy are more complicated
expressions. Equations (3.7)-(3.9) are relatively simple, but
make error of the order of θ2.

3.3 High thermal inertia

Consider the opposite limiting case of very high thermal in-
ertia, θ (cid:29) 1. It happens if the asteroid rotates very rapidly,
or has very large heat conductivity. In this case the temper-
ature at each point of the surface varies only slightly during
the asteroid’s day, and always remains close to its mean, τ0.

Then the boundary condition reduces to,

Comparing the solution given by Eqs. (3.5) and (3.12) with

diﬀerence between τ and τ0 is indeed of order of θ−1 and
thus can be neglected with respect to other terms, so our
assumptions are justiﬁed.

Considering that temperature variations are small, we
can substitute the term τ 4 in Eqs. (2.32), (2.33) and (2.37)
0 (τ −τ0). Only terms proportional to A1 and B1
with τ 4
remain non-zero after integration over φ. Substituting them

We see that in high thermal inertia limit all dimension-
Yark decay as θ−1. The follow-
less pressures pτ
ing correction proportional to θ−2 might also be obtained via
taking next order term proportional to τ − τ0 in the right-
hand side of Eqn. (3.10), substituting there the approximate
solution, and equating the corresponding terms of the series.
Our approximation disregards this correction, thus error of
Eqs. (3.13)-(3.15) is of the order of θ−2.

This approach is more general, than the results by My-
sen (2008) and Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y (2008), as Mysen
(2008) limits his consideration to a simpliﬁed approximate
expression for insolation α, while Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y
(2008) consider only near-spherical shapes of asteroids. The

cost for this generality is a ﬁnal expression more coplicated,
than the ones obtained with additional constraints.

4 NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS FOR THE

GENERAL CASE

We created a C++ program, which employed implicit Eu-
ler method. We simulate heat conductivity in a horizontal
slab to then follow the temperature distribution for several
asteroid days giving it enough time to reach the periodic os-
cillation. Then we compute the YORP torque during the last
day. Such computation is repeated for several points evenly
distributed along the orbit and the result is averaged. We
choose the integration step in time, discretization in space,
thickness of the slab, relaxation time, and the number of
points on the orbit, such that the result does not change if
these parameters are improved.

Thus our program numerically solves Eqn. (2.11) with
initial and boundary conditions Eqn. (2.12–2.14) and cal-
culates the dimensionless pressures from Eqs. (2.32), (2.33)
sin, pτ
and (2.37). The resulting pressures pτ
Yark are
functions of three parametres ψ, ε, and θ.

In Figure 4 we present some cross-sections of these

90◦. Two pressures corresponding to obliquity component

attain their maximum inbetween.
Yark also steadily increases from a
maximum at ψ = 0◦ to 0 at ψ = 90◦, while pτ

The black line in the three left panels corresponds to
zero heat inertia and is constructed via numeric integration
of Eqn. (3.2). Numeric solutions of heat conductivity equa-
tion approach this line as θ → 0.

Dashed lines are calculated using Eqs. (3.7)-(3.9) in low
thermal inertia approximation, and dash-dot lines are calcu-
lated in high thermal inertia approximation with Eqs. (3.13)-
(3.15). Colour coding for these approximate formulae is the
same as for exact solutions plotted with solid lines. Low and
high thermal inertia approximations are in good agreement
with exact solutions for θ (cid:28) 1 and θ (cid:29) 1 respectively. The
accuracy of 10% for pτ
sin is attained if respectively θ < 0.3
and θ > 10. For pτ
Yark this accuracy is attained if
θ < 0.1 and θ > 30.
Some lines demonstrate kinks at ψ = 90◦ − ε. These
kinks are the most prominent in the plot for pτ
cos (middle

appearance and disappearance of polar day and polar night.

5 ROBUSTNESS OF RESULTS

Results obtained in this paper rely on several assumptions,
and strictly speaking are applicable only for convex asteroids
on circular orbits with Lambert’s scattering and emission
indicatrices and locally ﬂat surface. Now we shall examine
these assumptions and discuss their impact on the applica-
bility of our results.

5.1 Convexity of the asteroid

Calculation of incoming energy for each surface element is
based on the assumption of the asteroid to be convex. Con-
cave shape leads to two complications: shadowing and self-
heating. However if the asteroid is only moderately concave,
shadowing occurs only for rays with glancing angle of inci-
dence, which anyway contribute little energy per unit area
due to small projection onto the normal. Self-heating for
such asteroid can be even less important because in this
case glancing angles of incidence mean not only small pro-
jection onto the normal, but also small emitted intensity in
Lambert’s law. Thus we expect that proposed formalism, al-
though developed under the assumption of a convex shape,
will also work reasonably well for moderately concave aster-
oids.

To test this assumption, we are using a ray tracing pro-
gram, which calculates the YORP acceleration experienced
by non-convex asteroids. The program randomly casts rays
on the surface of the asteroid, allowing for each of them to be
randomly scattered with the directions distributed in accor-
dance with Lambert’s law, tests if it is absorbed by another
surface element after the scattering, and if so, it is scattered
again, and so on. The program computes the angular mo-
mentum conveyed to the asteroid by the rays. It assumes
instant re-emission of each ray, and thus works in Rubin-
cam’s approximation. We do not separate light into visible
and infrared, but assume that Lambert’s law describes both
scattering and re-emission, so we just trace a ray of constant
energy, and only frequency distribution of energy changes in
the ray after scattering/re-emission events.

Plots of the axial component of YORP computed by
the program for radar models of three asteroids are shown
in Figure 5. Results of the computation using Eqn. (2.38) are
shown for comparison. We see that moderately non-convex
4179 Toutatis demonstrates a very good agreement between
Eqn. (2.38) and the ray tracing program. Even for strongly
non-convex contact binary 216 Kleopatra the two computa-
tions at least qualitatively agree with each other. And only
for extremely non-conxex 6489 Golevka the two curves com-
pletely diﬀer. All other shapes we tested (1620 Geographos,
2063 Bacchus, 1998 KY26) demonstrate good agreement be-
tween the two curves, similar to the case with Toutatis. Thus
we conclude, that although Eqs. (2.38)–(2.41) were derived
under the assumption of convex shape, for most real shapes
of asteroids they also work reasonably well.

Our simulations are similar to the ones performed by
Rozitis & Green (2013). We see a perfect agreement of the
shapes of both our analytic and ray tracing plots for 4179
Toutatis and 6489 Golevka with the corresponding plots in
ﬁgure 7 in Rozitis & Green (2013), although the normaliza-
tion of the plots is diﬀerent.

Our program assumes instant re-emission of the ab-

sorbed light, and thus relies on the assumption that Ru-
bincam’s approximation can be used for precize calculation
of the axial component of YORP. Although we have proved
this theorem only for convex asteroids, it can be also gener-
alized for the case of concave asteroids. A proof of this the-
orem under very general assumptions is given in Appendix
A.

5.2 Circularity of the orbit

Throughout the article we assumed the orbit to be circular.
If the orbit is elliptical, the solar energy ﬂux Φ decreases with
the increase of heloicentric distance r(cid:12). The angular speed of
orbital motion dυ/dt also decreases with the increase of r(cid:12).
In Rubincam’s approximation these two factors depending
on r(cid:12) cancel out, and ellipticity of the orbit only results

in a prefactor depending on eccentricity being added to all
equations (see Appendix B for detail).

Beyond Rubincam’s approximation the eﬀect of eccen-
tricity is more substantial. Still most of our analytic and
numerical results can be easily modiﬁed to account for ec-
centricity. The exact modiﬁcations needed are described in
Appendix B. Equations do not become much more compli-
cated, but the number of free parameters increases from 3
to 5, making the result more diﬃcult to analyze and param-
eterize.

5.3 Lambert’s law

We assumed Lambert’s law for scattered and emitted light.
If Lambert’s law does not hold true for emitted light,
but its indicatrix is still independent on the incidence an-
gle, it causes only a minor correction to our theory. Indeed,
assume we have some emission indicatrix F e(δ), where δ is
the angle of the emitted ray with the normal to the sur-
face. Then the recoil pressure created by the emitted light is
P = K eεσT 4, with the coeﬃcient K e given by the formula

π/2(cid:90)

K e =

2π cos i sin i F e(δ)dδ.

(5.1)

0

For Lambert’s scattering law F e(δ) = 1
π cos(δ) we have
K e = 2/3, which we used in Eqn. (2.19). A diﬀerent in-
dicatrix will result into coeﬃcient 2/3 being substituted for
the new K e in Eqn. (2.19) and all the consequent equations
for the force and torque generated by emitted light.

If scattered light is symmetric with respect to the nor-
mal, the same consideration also works for it. However most
scattering laws assume that the intensity of scattered light
depends not only on the angle δ, but also on the direction
of the incident light. The same happens if beaming is taken
into account for the emitted light (Rozitis & Green 2012).
The corresponding general theory is developed in Appendix
C and applied to Lommel–Seeliger law. Mathematically such
general theory is not much more complicated than the Lam-
bertian case, but the formulae are lenghtier and harder
to grasp. Our analysis also shows that corrections due to
Lommel–Seeliger law do not substantially change the results.
Therefore Lambert’s law for scattered light provides a use-
ful basic approximation. This agrees with analyzis by Bre-
iter & Vokrouhlick´y (2011), who integrated the torque over

the surface of the asteroid and also found that for Lommel–
Seeliger reﬂection the YORP eﬀect is not very diﬀerent from
the standard Lambertian calculations.

5.4 Locally ﬂat surface

Eqs. (2.1) and (2.12) assume that heat conductivity is 1-
dimensional and occures in an inﬁnite semispace under the
surface.

These assumptions break if the asteroid is small enough
for heat ﬂuxes to propagate from one side of the asteroid to
the other. This case has been extensively studied by Breiter
et al. (2010b).

Another important case when heat conductivity may no
longer be considered as occuring in 1-dimensional semispace
is the case of rough surface, e.g. stones lying on the surface of
an asteroid. This case analyzed by Golubov & Krugly (2012),
Golubov et al. (2014) and ˇSeveˇcek et al. (2015) leads to a
concept of tangential YORP, which appears due to asym-
metric emission of light by symmetric stones and manifests
itself in a tangential drag force acting on the surface.

Thus results of this article are applicable only to larger
asteroids (at least tens of metres) with relatively smooth
surface.

6 RESULTS

The main results of this article can be split in three parts.
Firstly, we propose a uniﬁed theory for the YORP and
Yarkovsky eﬀects, expressing torques and forces experienced
by an asteroid as integrals over its surface. These integrals
include functions, which must be obtained from solutions
of heat conductivity equation. Although these can not be
expressed analytically, they depend only on three free pa-
rameters, and once parameterized can be used to calculate
the YORP torque and the Yarkovsky force experienced by
any asteroid. This approach is a generalization of results
by Golubov & Krugly (2010) and Steinberg & Sari (2011),
which were obtained under the assumption of zero heat con-
ductivity.
Secondly, we introduce approximate methods to express
these functions in quadratures for the cases of θ (cid:28) 1 and
θ (cid:29) 1. Despite that we only use these approximations to

plied to a much broader range of problems connected with
thermal models of asteroidal and planetary surfaces.

Thirdly, we examine the area of applicability of stan-
dard treatment of the YORP eﬀect. We ﬁnd that moderately
concave asteroids still may be safely simulated with our con-
vex model for YORP. Our model can be generalized for the
case of non-Lambertian scattering laws, but the results are
very similar to the ones obtained for Lambert’s scattering.
Elliptical orbits can also be easily incorporated into our gen-
eral formalizm. The independence of the axial component of
YORP on the thermal model appears to be very robust, and
holds for concave asteroids and non-Lambertian scattering
laws. This result allows simulating YORP acceleration in
Rubincam’s approximation.

APPENDIX A: INDEPENDENCE OF TZ ON
THE THERMAL MODEL

In Subsection 2.3 we have demonstrated that the axial com-
ponent of YORP Tz is independent of the thermal model.
Although we restricted our proof to convex asteroids only,
it appears that this result does not depend on the convex-
ity of the asteroid and can be proved under much broader
assumptions.

Concavity of the asteroid’s shape adds more complica-
tions to the proof of applicability of Rubincam’s approxima-
tion, but it still appears to hold as long as scattering indi-
catrix remains independent of the wavelength and emission
indicatrix stays independent of the temperature. Denoting
power coming from surface element i to surface element j at
wavelength λ via P λ

i→j, we have

P λ
i→j = a(cid:12)ij(t)P λ(cid:12)→i(t) +

akijP λ

k→i + bijP λ

i→.

(A1)

k

Here P λ
i→ corresponds to the power emitted by element i
at wavelength λ due to heat radiation, and P λ(cid:12)→i(t) is the
power coming directly from the Sun to element i at wave-
length λ. Coeﬃcients bij here describe the emission indica-
trix, whereas coeﬃcients akij and a(cid:12)ij the scattering indica-
trix. The ﬁrst term in the right hand side of Eqn. (A1) corre-
sponds to direct sunlight scattered in the direction i → j, the
sum represents light coming from all other surface elements,
which is re-scattered in this direction, and the ﬁnal term ac-
counts for emitted light. Here a(cid:12)ij(t) and P λ(cid:12)→i(t) explicitly
depend on time via position of the Sun. Coeﬃcients a and
b are assumed to be independent of wavelength.

Equation (A1) is being integrated over the wavelength
and the result being averaged over time. Denoting all powers
integrated over wavelength by the same symbol without su-
percript λ, and assuming chevrons for time averaging, Eqn.
(A1) transforms into
(cid:104)Pi→j(cid:105) = (cid:104)a(cid:12)ij(t)P(cid:12)→i(t)(cid:105)+

akij(cid:104)Pk→i(cid:105)+bij(cid:104)Pi→(cid:105). (A2)

Substituting Eqn. (A3) into Eqn. (A2), we get

(cid:104)Pk→i(cid:105) =
= (cid:104)a(cid:12)ij(t)P(cid:12)→i(t)(cid:105) + bij(cid:104)P(cid:12)→i(t)(cid:105).

(A4)

Taken in complex for all i and j, Eqn. (A4) corresponds
to a set of linear equations, which deﬁnes functions (cid:104)Pi→j(cid:105),
independently of the thermal model. This leads to Eqn. (A3)
implying the mean emitted powers (cid:104)Pi→(cid:105) to be independent
of thermal model. Therefore the recoil pressures and the
YORP eﬀect created by this emission are also constant. (The
latter conclusion also relies on the emission indicatrix being
independent of the wavelength.)

Both assumptions of scattering and emission indicatri-
ces being independent of wavelength are essential for the
axial component of YORP to stay independent of the ther-
mal model. If either of these assumptions breaks down, Eqn.
(A1) no longer leads to Eqn. (A2), and the heat model en-
ters the YORP eﬀect computations via the wavelength at
which heat emission will predominantly occur.

APPENDIX B: YORP FOR ELLIPTICAL
ORBITS
If the orbit is elliptical with eccentricity e (cid:54)= 0, we get two
important complications in the calculation of YORP.

Firstly, the insolation Φ is not constant anymore, but

depends on the heliocentric distance r(cid:12) as

Φ =

Φ0
r2(cid:12)

,

(B1)

where Φ0 is solar constant (solar radiation ﬂux at 1 AU),
and r(cid:12) is measured in astronomic units.

Secondly, angular speed of the asteroid on the orbit
varies, so that orbit average is no longer equal to average
over orbital phase υ: time dtorb stands in the same propor-
tion to the area of orbit segment r2(cid:12)dυ/2 covered with the
elapse of this time, as the orbital period Torb stands to the
1 − e2. From this proportion we

total area of the orbit πa2√

obtain

dtorb =

√

Torbr2(cid:12)dυ
1 − e2

2πa2

.

(B2)

In Rubincam’s approximation all our integrals are pro-
portional to Φdtorb, thus factors r2(cid:12) cancel, and all our anal-
ysis for circular orbits is valid, if only Φ is substituted with
the combination

Φ1 =

√
Φ0
1 − e2

.

(B3)

To go beyond Rubincam’s approximation we need to
modify our equations more substancially. First of all, we
need the dependence of r(cid:12) on υ, which for elliptic orbit is

r(cid:12) =

a(1 − e2)

1 + e cos (υ − ω)

,

(B4)

where ω is argument of perihelion of the asteroid in its own

We go through the entire derivation again, and end up
with the same expressions as before, but with the following
substitutions:

(1 − e2)3/2

Φ → Φ1.
Deﬁnitions of τ and θ must be also slightly changed by sub-
stituting Φ1 instead of Φ in Eqs. (2.10) and (2.15).

(B7)

(B6)

Similarly to Section 3 we get expressions for Rubincam’s
approximation, low and high thermal inertia limits. Analo-
gously to Section 4 we can simulate Eqs. (2.10) and (2.15)
with α modiﬁed numerically, and then numerically average
it with the modiﬁed dυ.

For pα

z and pα

sin additional factors in Eqs. (B5) and (B6)
cancel, and the impact of ellipticity is reduced to alteration
of Φ according to Eqn. (B1).

For pτ

cos the impact of ellipticity is more pro-
found. We must substitute Eqn. (B5) into Eqn. (2.12), and
Eqn. (B6) into Eqs. (2.32) and (2.33), thus obtaining cor-
rected expressions for pτ
cos are
plotted in Figure B1. They depend not only on ψ, ε and
θ, but also on e and ω. Additional free parameters make
these formulae for elliptical orbits harder to paremeterize,
and thus less useful. Still, these formulae provide us with
the quantitative estimate of impact of ellipticity of the orbit
on the results obtained for circular orbits.

Interestingly, for eccentric orbits pτ

be non-zero even for ε = 0. This behavior agrees with Breiter
et al. (2010a), who predicted non-zero obliquity component
of YORP for ε = 0 and e (cid:54)= 0, and called it seasonal YORP
eﬀect in attitude by analogy with the seasonal Yarkovsky
eﬀect in orbital motion. Still our analysis proves the anal-
ogy relatively weak: the seasonal Yarkovsky eﬀect is caused
by seasonal temperature waves, while the seasonal YORP
eﬀect in attitude appears in our model with periodic ini-
tial conditions, which exclude seasonal temperature waves.
Thus the simplest possible explanation is that in nonlinear
heat conductivity model the mean thermal re-emission lag
is smaller for higher temperatures, so that the torques ex-
perienced by the asteroid in diﬀerent points of its orbit do
not compensate each other. Although the seasonal temper-

ature variations are in turn caused by seasonal temperature
waves.

APPENDIX C: NON-LAMBERTIAN
SCATTERING LAWS

Throughout this paper we assumed Lambert’s law to govern
scattering of light by the surface of the asteroid. In this
appendix we shall get rid of this assumption and generalize
our treatment for any scattering indicatrix. Let us assume
an arbitrary scattering law for visible light,

Bα(i, δ, α) = Φ cos iF α(i, δ, α).

(C1)

Here Bα is the brightness of the surface, i.e. energy ﬂux
sent by a unit surface element into a unit solid angle. The
angle i between the incident light ray and the normal to
the surface can be found from Eqn. (2.7) by substituting
cos i = s · n (see Figure C2). Also, δ represents the angle
between the emitted light ray and the normal to the surface,
α is the angle between the projections of the incident and
the scattered light rays onto the surface of the asteroid, and
Φ is the incident radiation ﬂux. The function F α determines
the scattering law.

from the equations

+ cos ψ sin ε sin v)/ (sin φ cos v − cos φ cos ε sin v) ,

sign (cos β) = sign (sin φ cos v − cos φ cos ε sin v) .

(C3)
For isotropic surfaces F α(i, δ, α) = F α(i, δ,−α). Thus,
if we consider two time instances of the same day, one of
which is as close to dawn as the other is to setting (i1 = i2,
β1 = −β2), and two rays emitted at these instances so that
δ1 = δ2, α1 = −α2, we see that the term proportional to m
cancels itself after time averaging. The two resulting terms
lead to the following expression for the mean torque created
by scattered visible light,

Finally, adding torque from Eqs. (C4) and (C9) we end
up with the same formula Eqn. (2.38) for the total torque

for the latitude factor. Instead of Eqn. (2.26), now we have

If scattering indicatrix depends on the wavelength, then
averaging over the entire spectrum must be performed in
Eqn. (C10). If emission indicatrix is also diﬀerent for diﬀer-
ent wavelengths of the emitted light, and the ratio between
the wavelengths depends on the temperature, then Rubin-
cam’s approximation breaks down as it was discussed at the
end of Appendix A, and our approach can not be used any
longer.

Anyway, it appears, that Eqn. (2.38) has a fairly wide
area of applicability, and only the expression for the latitude
factor must be modiﬁed for diﬀerent scattering and emis-
sion laws. Even though the general expression Eqn. (2.38) is
pretty complex, it can be tabulated for any practically im-
portant set of scattering and emission laws, and then used
for any shape of an asteroid.

For instance, we can study the latitude factor for
