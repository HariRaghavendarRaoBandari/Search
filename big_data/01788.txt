Abstract

We construct, in the work, chiral SU (3) Lagrangian with D mesons of spin J P = 0− and J P = 1−

and charmed baryons of spin J P = 1/2+ and J P = 3/2+. There are 42 leading two-body counter-

terms involving two charmed baryon ﬁelds and two D meson ﬁelds in the constructed Lagrangian.

The heavy-quark spin symmetry leads to 35 sum rules while the large-Nc operator analysis predicts

29 ones at the next-to leading order of 1/Nc expansion. The combination of the sum rules from

both the heavy-quark symmetry and the large-Nc analysis results in 38 independent sum rules

which reduces the number of free parameters in the chiral Lagrangian down to 4 only. This is

a remarkable result demonstrating the consistency of the heavy-quark symmetry and large-Nc

operator analysis.

INTRODUCTION

The chiral SU(3) Lagrangian with mesons and baryons has been a very useful tool to

study the nature of baryon resonant states [1–4]. It is also extensively applied for studying

meson and baryon resonances in the charm sector. For instance, the leading order chiral

Lagrangian is used to study on s-wave scattering of Goldstone bosons oﬀ D mesons which

is based on coupled-channel calculation [5–8]. This leads to the formation of scalar and

axial-vector D mesons with properties compatible with the available experimental data. In

addition, the couple channel scheme has been utilized to study the s-wave scattering by

using chiral Lagrangian interaction of Goldstone boson with the octet and decuplet baryons

[9–11] as well as with the ground state open charmed baryon [12, 13]. In particular, a rich

spectrum of s- and d-wave for exotic charmed baryon resonances is dynamically generated

by zero-range of t-channel vector meson exchange interactions [14–16].

Moreover, the application of chiral Lagrangian in the hidden charmed baryons is also

received a number of attentions by using the couple channel dynamics framework. This study
is motivated by FAIR at GSI with ¯PANDA experiment which will be in a promising position

to provide more data on new exotic states of charm and strangeness degree of freedom [17].

The couple channel calculations with the chiral Lagrangian have been done to explore new

resonances in the high energy region. For example, the nucleon like resonances with the

hidden charm quantum number are dynamically generated by using chiral Lagrangian with

various models such as t-channel vector meson exchange picture with SU(4) ﬂavor-symmetry

[14, 18], local hidden gauge formalism [19, 20], Weinberg-Tomozawa interaction with heavy-

quark symmetry [21] and a combination of heavy-quark and local hidden gauge symmetries

[22]. Noting that most of those approaches have been employed the heavy-quark symmetry

to incorporate the chiral Lagrangian in their works. The main idea of heavy-quark symmetry

is that in the inﬁnite limit of heavy-quark mass the pseudoscalar and vector mesons with

one heavy-quark form a degeneracy state [23] as well as for charmed baryons with spin-
2 and 3
in the heavy quark sector. However, deviations of the heavy-quark symmetry is expected

It is well known that the heavy quark symmetry plays an important role

1

2 [24].

because the charm quark mass is not extremely larger than a typical conﬁnement scale

ΛQCD [25]. Therefore, in order to relate more closely to QCD, one might take an additional

approximated symmetry of QCD into account.

2

Large-Nc QCD, on the other hand, is another approximated symmetry of QCD. This

idea is originally suggested by ref. [26] which notes that one can consider the color number

of degrees of freedom (Nc) to be large and expand it in power of 1/Nc. By using such

expansion, a number of simpliﬁcations of QCD occurs in the large number of colors limit.

This approach has been shown that it is very useful in the study of baryons at the low-

energy regime (for review see [28, 29]). An interesting prediction of large-Nc QCD is the

approximate degeneracy of the baryon octet and decuplet states [27]. The octet and decuplet
+ form a super multiplet in the large-Nc limit. According

states with J P = 1
2

+ and J P = 3
2

to Nc counting rules for meson-baryon system [27], subsequently, this leads to a spin-ﬂavor

symmetry for baryons at the large-Nc limit [30, 31]. In particular, a combination of heavy-

quark symmetry and large-Nc provides some predictions of heavy baryons with excited and

exotic states for example [32–38].

Since the leading order interaction of the Goldstone bosons with any hadron is dictated

by the chiral symmetry. Namely, the long-range part of the interaction is controlled by chiral

interactions only. But this is not the case for the interaction of the D mesons with baryons.

The D mesons interact with baryons via local contact terms which can not be constrained

by chiral symmetry. The short range part needs to be parameterized in terms of a priori

unknown contact interactions. In order to compute a complete couple channel calculation,

one needs to include both of the short-rang and long-range interactions in to account. In a

previous work [39], such counter terms were studied systematically in the light of the heavy-

quark symmetry and large-Nc sum rules. The 26 counter terms were correlated so that

only 7 unknown parameters remain. Furthermore, a corresponding analysis for describing

the short-range interaction of the Goldstone bosons with the charmed baryons has been

performed by ref. [40]. The 36 counter terms were reduced down to 6 unknown parameters

only.

This work is to prepare for systematic coupled-channel computations on resonances of

hidden-charm baryon (charm quantum number equals to zero for example anti-D mesons and

charmed baryons interactions) and doubly charmed baryon (charm quantum number equals

to two e.g. D mesons with charmed baryons system) sectors. A systematic construction of

the leading 2-body counter terms for the D mesons with J P = 0− and 1− and the charmed
+ quantum numbers is considered. The low-energy constants of

baryons with J P = 1
2

+ and 3
2

the chiral Lagrangian are correlated by using heavy-quark symmetry with a suitable super

3

multiplets of D mesons [6, 41–44] and charmed baryons [24, 45, 46]. To work out the sum

rules from large-Nc scheme, we study baryon matrix elements of the correlation functions

[39, 40, 47, 48]. The matrix elements are expanded in the power of 1/Nc by applying the

operator identities of [51, 52]. The technology of large-Nc operator analysis is developed

by [40, 48–52]. It has been shown that this technology is well suitable for application to

charmed baryons [40].

This paper is organized as follows. In section II the chiral Lagrangian with D mesons and

charmed baryons will be constructed. The next section is that the implications of the heavy-

quark spin symmetry for D mesons and charmed baryons on the low- energy constants are

worked out. A corresponding large-Nc operators analysis is performed in section IV. Finally,

section V is a summary of the main results.

II. CHIRAL LAGRANGIAN WITH D MESONS AND CHARMED BARYONS

In this section, the construction rules for the chiral SU(3) Lagrangian density are recalled.

We refer to refs.

to describe the pseudoscalar and vector D mesons [6]. Explicit chiral symmetry-breaking
is included in terms of scalar and pseudoscalar source ﬁelds χ± proportional to the quark
mass matrix of QCD with χ0 = 2 B0 diag(mu, md, ms). The merit of the particular ﬁeld
combinations in Eq. (1) is their identical transformation property under chiral SUL(3) ⊗
SUR(3) rotations.

It is convenient to decompose the ﬁelds in terms of their isospin multiplets. They are

given by,

Φ = τ · π(140) + α† · K(494) + K†(494) · α + η(547) λ8 ,

The matrices λi are the Gell-Mann matrices. The open-charm meson ﬁelds D and Dµν form
ﬂavor antitriplets with e.g. D = (D0,−D+, D+
s ).

The chiral Lagrangian consists of all possible interaction terms formed with the ﬁelds
Uµ, B[¯3], B[6], Bµ
[6], D , Dµν and χ±. Derivatives of the ﬁelds must be included in compliance
with the local chiral SU(3) symmetry. This leads to the notion of a covariant derivative Dµ
which is identical for all ﬁelds in Eq. (1). The covariant derivative Dµ acts on the anti-triplet
(D , B[¯3]) and sextet (B[6]) ﬁelds as follows:

µ,a Db ,

(Dµ D)a = ∂µDa − Γb
(DµB[¯3])ab = ∂µBab
[¯3] + Γa
(DµB[6])ab = ∂µBab + Γa

with Γµ = −Γ†µ given by
Γµ = 1

2 u†h∂µ − i (vµ + aµ)i u + 1

2 uh∂µ − i (vµ − aµ)i u† .

The chiral Lagrangian is a powerful tool once it is combined with appropriate counting

rules leading to a systematic approximation strategy. We apply here conventional chiral-

power counting rules with [47]

χ± ∼ Q2 ,
γ5 ∼ Q ,

Uµ ∼ Q ,
14×4 , γµ , γµ γ5 , σµν ∼ Q0 ,

Γµ ∼ Q ,

(4)

where Q is a typical small scale. If the covariant derivative Dµ acts on any meson ﬁeld it is
counted as order Q. In contrast, owing to the large baryon masses, if the covariant derivative
Dµ acts on a baryon mass and it is counted as order Q0. Nevertheless, speciﬁc combinations
like i γµ Dµ − M ∼ Q are suppressed if acting on a baryon ﬁeld. Here M denotes the chiral
limit value of a baryon mass. The proper leading chiral power of a vertex involving baryon

ﬁelds is identiﬁed upon a non-relativistic on-shell expansion, where any 3-momentum is

5

assigned the chiral order Q. Our goal is to study hadronic interactions at low-energy by

constructing an expansion in small momenta and small quark masses. In the following, we

construct the leading order two-body counter terms involving two D meson and two charmed

baryon ﬁelds. The main purpose of this work is to study the interaction of the D mesons

with the charmed baryons. We focus on the residual short-range interactions described by

local two-body counter terms. Since we are interested in D mesons and charmed baryons

with small 3-momentum controlling the chiral power counting, we construct the two-body

terms with the minimal number of derivatives. We discriminate terms with two spin- 1
2
2 charmed baryon ﬁelds, L(d), and the mixing spin- 1
charmed baryon ﬁelds, L(c), two spin- 3
and 3

2 terms, L(e). We write

Lcounter = L(c) + L(d) + L(e) .

We begin with the terms with two baryon spin- 1

Altogether we constructed 20 + 10 + 12 = 42 leading order two-body counter terms. In the

following sections, we will use the heavy-quark symmetry and the large Nc operator analysis

to correlate the coupling constants introduced here.

III. HEAVY QUARK MASS EXPANSION

At the limit of an inﬁnite charm quark mass, the D mesons with spin-0− and -1− are

replaced by a spin ﬂip of the charm quark. This is also true for the charmed baryons with

With the same manner, the transformation properties of H[¯3] are implied. In contrast to the
H ﬁeld case, there is a nontrivial Dirac matrix neither left to the ﬁelds H µ

[6] and ¯H[¯3] are invariant under the spin group SUv(2) [40]. With help

of above rules, we are ready to construct SUv(2)-invariant interaction terms.

Now it is straightforward to construct the SUv(2)-invariant eﬀective Lagrange density

bearing the structures detailed in Eq. (5). We introduce

We recall that the ﬁelds H and H[6,¯3] are three-dimensional row and square matrices in ﬂavor
space, each of its components consisting of a 4 dimensional Dirac matrix. In addition, Tr

and tr stand for traces in Dirac and ﬂavor spaces respectively.

With help of Eq. (9) and Eq. (10), the chiral and the SUv(2)-invariant eﬀective La-

grangians can be expressed in terms of the ﬁelds P+ , P µ

According to the heavy-quark symmetry, the 42 parameters of the chiral Lagrangian with D-

IV. LARGE-Nc OPERATOR ANALYSIS

In this section, we follow the works of [39, 40, 48–51], where a formalism for systematic

expansion of baryon-matrix elements of QCD quark currents in powers of 1/Nc was devel-

oped. Here we will use the main results and basic ideas. Refs. [39, 40, 48] have performed

applications of this framework to correlation functions with a production of two axial-vector

or vector quark currents. The main objective of this section is to derive correlations amongst

the low-energy constants introduced in the chiral Lagrangian as they follow from a 1/Nc ex-

pansion. For that purpose, we consider the correlation functions of the product of vector

and axial-vector currents. We utilize the formalism for the case of charm changing quark

currents which introduced in ref.

[39]. In section II, we constructed the chiral Lagrangian

with D mesons and charmed baryons that introduced in Eq. (5). While from the construc-

tion it follows that the various terms are invariant under chiral transformations, the relation

to QCD’s Greens function is less transparent. In order to connect more closely to QCD, it

is useful to consider charm-changing axial-vector and vector currents in the generating func-

tional [47, 53]. In turn the eﬀective Lagrangian and generating functional will then depend

on such external and charm-changing sources. We introduce charm-changing axial-vector

and vector currents

Aµ(x) = (cid:16) ¯u(x) , ¯d(x) , ¯s(x)(cid:17) γµ γ5 c(x) ,
Vµ(x) = (cid:16) ¯u(x) , ¯d(x) , ¯s(x)(cid:17) γµ c(x) ,

¯Aµ(x) = ¯c(x) γµ γ5

,

¯Vµ(x) = ¯c(x) γµ




(17)

with the quark-ﬁeld operators u(x), d(x), s(x), c(x) of the up, down, strange and charm

quarks. The charm changing vector and axial-vector currents are accessed by coupling to
the classical source functions Aµ(x) and V µ(x) directly [39]. Then one can introduce a direct
coupling of these classical sources to the D meson ﬁelds as

L(V A) = fAhAµ (∂µ ¯D) + (∂µ D) ¯Aµi +

fV

MV hV ν (∂µ ¯Dµν) + (∂µ Dµν) ¯V νi ,

(18)

where fA and fV are some coupling constants.

In this work, we consider baryon matrix elements of the following products of two quark

11

currents [39]:

C AA

C V V

µν,a(q) = i Z d4x e−i q·x T Aµ(0) λ¯a ¯Aν(x) ,
µν,a(q) = i Z d4x e−i q·x T Vµ(0) λ¯a ¯Vν(x) ,
µν,a(q) = i Z d4x e−i q·x T Vµ(0) λ¯a ¯Aν(x) ,

C V A

¯Aµ(x) = A†µ(x) ,

¯Vµ(x) = V †µ (x) ,

(19)

with the quark ﬁeld operators u(x), d(x), s(x), c(x) of the up, down, strange and charm
quarks where λ¯a with ¯a = 0,· · · , 8 and T is time ordering operator. We denote the Gell-
Mann matrices supplemented with a singlet matrix λ0 = p2/3 1 3×3. We are interested in

such matrix elements, since they receive contributions from the chiral Lagrangian in Eq. (5)

and they deﬁne a rigorous basis for the derivation of large-Nc sum rules in the latter.

In the following, we derive and analyze the contributions of the chiral Lagrangian in

section II. Following [40], the physical baryon states,

|p, ij±, S, χi ,

(20)

are speciﬁed by the momentum p and the ﬂavor indices i, j = 1, 2, 3. The spin S and the
spin-polarization are χ = 1, 2 for the spin one-half (S = 1/2) and χ = 1,· · · , 4 for the spin
three-half states (S = 3/2). The ﬂavor sextet and the anti-triplet are discriminated by their
symmetric (index +) and anti-symmetric (index −) behaviour under the exchange of i ↔ j.
By using the LSZ reduction formalism, one notes that charmed baryon matrix elements

of the correlation operators in Eq. (19) have contributions from the on-shell D meson propa-

gators (we refer to ref. [18] for technical details of pseudoscalar and vector D mesons). They

are identiﬁed unambiguously by taking the residuum of poles generated by the incoming and

outgoing D meson. For sake of a simplicity, we introduce the new notation,

¯C XY

µν, ¯a(¯q, q) =

¯q2 − M 2

X

fX

C XY

µν, ¯a(¯q, q)

q2 − M 2

Y

fY

,

(21)

with X, Y = V, A and MA and MV the masses of the pseudo-scalar and vector D mesons

in the ﬂavor SU(3) limit. In Eq. (21), we identify qµ and ¯qµ with the 4-momenta of the

incoming and outgoing D mesons.

According to the chiral Lagrangian in Eq. (5), we calculate the charmed baryon matrix

elements at leading order of non-relativistic expansion of the correlation functions in Eq. (21).
For technical convenience, we choose the center-of-momentum frame with qi = − pi and ¯qi =

12

− ¯pi where qi (pi) and ¯qi (¯pi) are incoming and outgoing 3-momentum of D mesons (charmed
baryons) respectively. We focus on the space components of the correlation functions. The

leading terms in the low-momentum expansion of the matrix elements of the product of the

two axial-vector currents are

where the ﬂavor indices a = 1,· · · , 8 . We note that the charmed baryon matrix elements

expansion.

Our plan for this section is to match the spin-ﬂavor structures of the given matrix elements

of the correlation functions in Eqs. (22), (25) and (26) with the 1/Nc operator expansion of

the matrix elements in Eq. (21) which will be worked out in the latter.

The large-Nc operator analysis of baryons containing light quarks in refs. [39, 48, 49, 51]
rewrites matrix elements in the physical baryon states |p, χi in terms of auxiliary states |χ)
which reﬂect the spin and ﬂavor structure of the baryons only. Here |p, χi stands for the
charmed baryon states with spin- 1
2 , χi, introduced
already in Eq. (20). In terms of 1/Nc expansion, all dynamical information of the correlation

2 , χi, and spin- 3

2 , |p , ij+, 3

2 , |p , ij±, 1

functions with physical states is transferred into eﬀective operators with eﬀective states. The

1/Nc expansion of the correlation functions takes a generic form

h¯p, ¯χ| ¯Cµν,a(¯q, q) |p, χi = Xr

cr(¯p, p)( ¯χ| O(r)

µν,a |χ) ,

(27)

where we assume all 4-momenta to be on-shell. The correlation operator ¯Cµν,a(¯q, q) was
introduced already in (21). In the the center-of-momentum frame, the two 3-momenta ¯p

and p characterize the kinematics. In particular for the case of baryon containing the light-
and heavy-quarks, one can generalize the 1/Nc eﬀective operator O(r) in the following form

O(r) = N r

containing Nl light and Nh heavy quarks with Nc = Nl + Nh [52]. In this work, our eﬀective
charmed baryon staes, |ij± , χ), are composed of light- and heavy-quarks. In order to apply
the 1/Nc expansion for the baryon matrix elements, one needs to provide the action of the

spin, ﬂavor and spin-ﬂavor operators on the eﬀective charmed baryon states. The complete

set of corresponding eﬀective operators of the light- and heavy-quarks are given in details

in refs. [40, 52]. Here we recall the results for Nc = 3 ,

It is important to note that one may write down the eﬀective operators product expan-

sion of Eq. (28) in an inﬁnite way at a given order of the 1/Nc expansion. However, one

can eliminate redundant operators by using operator identities [39, 48, 50]. The operator

identities are very useful framework for a systematic 1/Nc expansion. It allows a systematic

summation of the inﬁnite number of relevant operators at a given 1/Nc order. The opera-

tor identities are ﬁrst derived in [50] for the light-quarks operators. Later this framework

is generalized for the baryon containing the heavy-quarks [52]. In addition, the complete

stet of operator identities has been worked out for the matrix elements of charmed baryon

states in the ref. [40]. The structure of operator identities and its derivation for the baryon

containing the light- and heavy-quarks are given in technical details in refs.

[40, 52]. We

use only the main results here.

We turn to consider the 1/Nc expansion of the operators product of the charmed baryon

matrix elements in Eq. (21). With help of the operator identities, the baryon matrix elements

17

of the time-ordered product of two axial-vector and vector quark currents are expanded in

powers of the eﬀective one-body operators according to Eq. (27). This ansatz has been

worked out in ref. [39] with the matrix element of the octet and decuplet eﬀective baryon

states.

In terms of the construction of the eﬀective operators parity and time-reversal

transformation properties are taken into account. To the next-leading order in the power of

1/Nc expansion we ﬁnd the relevance of the following 11 eﬀective operators

where the ﬂavor index ¯a in Eq. (31) runs from 0 to 8. In addition, the matrix elements of

all symmetric combinations of two one-body eﬀective operators in the appendix of ref. [40]

are taken into account for our analysis of 1/Nc expansion.

Matching the spin-ﬂavor structures between the non-relativistic expansions Eqs. (22),

(25) and (26) and the charmed baryon matrix elements of the 1/Nc eﬀective quark operator

product expansions in Eq. (31), leads to the correlations between the unknown parameters

in both expansions. One ﬁnds

Considering only the large-Nc operator expansion analysis, the free parameters in the La-
grangian are reduced from 42 to 42 − 29 = 13.

The combination of the large-Nc sum rules Eq. (33) with the ones from the heavy-quark

19

symmetry in Eq. (16) leads to 3 additional sum rules,

f (S)
2 = f (S)

4 = f (T )

2 = 0 .

(34)

That is, the heavy-quark symmetry and large-Nc operator analysis together arise totally

38 sum rules, and hence the unknown parameters in the Lagrangian are reduced down to
42−38 = 4 only.

V. SUMMARY

We have constructed chiral SU(3) Lagrangian with D mesons of spin J P = 0− and

J P = 1− and charmed baryons of spin J P = 1/2+ and J P = 3/2+. There are altogether

42 independent terms in the chiral Lagrangian, which contribute, at chiral order Q0, to

scattering processes of the D mesons and charmed baryons. We have applied both the

heavy-quark symmetry and the large-Nc analysis to constraint the coupling constants. The

heavy-quark mass expansion provides 35 sum rules at leading order, while the 1/Nc analysis

at next-leading order of 1/Nc expansion predicts 29 sum rules. Combining the sum rules of

the two groups, we obtain 38 independent sum rules, and hence reduce the coupling constants

to 4 from 42. That is, the free chiral parameters are reduced by a factor of 10 approximately.

The result remarkably demonstrates the consistence of the heavy-quark symmetry and the

large-Nc analysis for the chiral Lagrangian with D mesons and charmed baryons. The sum

rules are useful constraints in establishing a systematic coupled-channel chiral eﬀective ﬁeld

theory for the D meson and charmed-baryon scattering beyond the threshold region in the

hidden and doubly charmed baryon systems.
