A fundamental property of any quantum device is its communication capacity, i.e. the maximal
amount of information that can be reliably conveyed per single use in the asymptotic limit. For
quantum measurements, this quantity is equivalent to the informational power, that is the maximal
amount of information that can be conveyed through a single use. Here, we operationally intro-
duce mixed quantum t designs as the most general arbitrary-rank extension of projective quantum
t designs which preserves indistinguishability from the uniform distribution for t copies, and we
quantify the communication capacity of mixed quantum t measurements. Our result is twofold.
First, we derive upper bounds on the communication capacity of any mixed t design measurement,
for t ∈ [1, 5]. Second, we explicitly compute the capacity of several mixed t designs measurements,
including of the depolarized version of: any qubit and qutrit symmetric, informationally complete
(SIC) measurement and complete mutually unbiased bases (MUB), the qubit icosahedral measure-
ment, the Hoggar SIC measurement, and the uniform distribution over pure states, for any value of
the depolarizing parameter.

INTRODUCTION

By establishing the most general description of any en-
coding and decoding devices, quantum theory provides
the ultimate limit of any communication protocol. Such
a limit is naturally quantiﬁed by the communication ca-
pacity, namely the highest rate at which information can
be reliably transmitted through any given device. The
quantiﬁcation of the communication capacity is therefore
of the utmost importance in both theoretical and exper-
imental quantum information theory. While quantifying
the communication capacity of any given quantum encod-
ing and decoding [1–10] device is operationally crucial, it
generally poses many technical challenges.

In quantum theory, the most general encoding and de-
coding devices are represented by quantum ensembles
and measurements, respectively. Arguably, the class
of ensembles and measurements with the largest num-
ber of applications in quantum information processing
is that of projective t designs (in their weighted and un-
weighted, discrete [11–16] or continuous [17] forms). Pro-
jective t designs are operationally deﬁned as ensembles
of pure states such that, upon input of (up to) t copies,
they cannot be discriminated from the uniformly distrib-
uted source other than by trivial guessing. For instance,
such a class includes symmetric,
informationally com-
plete (SIC) ensembles and measurements and mutually
unbiased bases (MUB). Their crucial role is celebrated in
a plethora of cryptographic [18], tomographic [19], com-
munication [1, 41], and information-locking [20] proto-
cols, as well as in the study of uncertainty relations [21]

and foundations of quantum theory [22–26].

Previous generalizations of projective t designs to the
arbitrary-rank case were either limited to speciﬁc sub-
sets, such as SICs or MUBs [27–31], or relaxed the prop-
erty of operational indistinguishability from the uniform
distribution for k < t copies [32]. Here we introduce
mixed t design quantum ensembles and measurements
as the most general arbitrary-rank extension of project-
ive t designs that preserve indistinguishability from the
uniform distribution given (up to) t copies. First, we de-
rive upper bounds on the communication capacity of any
mixed t-design measurement for t ∈ [1, 5]. Second, we
explicitly compute the capacity of the following mixed
t-design measurements:

• the qubit depolarized SIC,

• the qubit depolarized complete MUB,

• the qubit depolarized icosahedral conﬁguration,

• any qutrit depolarized SIC,

• the qutrit depolarized complete MUB,

• the 8-dimensional depolarized Hoggar SIC,

• any depolarized anti SIC, where each element is

orthogonal to one of the original SIC,

• the depolarized uniform distribution.

The work is structured as follows. In Sec. II A we intro-
duce mixed t designs and derive some of their basic prop-
erties.
In Sec. II B we discuss some fundamental facts
about the communication capacity of quantum measure-
ments.
In Sec. II C we present our main results about
the capacity of mixed t designs measurements. Finally,
we summarize our results and discuss some outlooks in
Sec. III.

DESIGNS

A. Mixed t designs

Let us ﬁrst recall some standard deﬁnitions and facts
Let H be a (ﬁnite) d-
from quantum theory [33].
dimensional Hilbert space, L(H) be the space of lin-
ear operators on H and L+(H) all positive-semideﬁnite
operators on H. The most general quantum state in
H is described by a density matrix, namely a positive-
semideﬁnite trace-one operator in L(H). Let (A, Σ) be
a Borel locally compact metric space equipped with a
Borel measure µ (In particular, it can be a ﬁnite set with
the uniform measure or a locally compact group with the
Haar measure.) The most general quantum preparation
in H is described by a quantum ensemble, namely a meas-
urable function ρ : A ∋ x 7→ ρx := px ˆρx ∈ L+(H), where
ˆρx is a quantum state, and x 7→ px is a probability dens-
ity (with respect to µ). The most general quantum meas-
urement in H is described by a positive operator-valued
measure (POVM). In particular, a POVM can be deﬁned
by a measurable function π : A ∋ y 7→ πy := dpy ˆπy ∈
L+(H), where ˆπy is a quantum state, y 7→ py is a probab-

the identity operator in L(H).

ility density (with respect to µ), and dR dµ(y)py ˆπy = 11,

We introduce in the following some quantities that
characterize ensembles and POVMs. For any measur-
able function χ from A to positive semideﬁnite operators
x 7→ χx := νpx ˆχx such that ν is a normalization, x 7→ px
is a probability density and ˆχx a quantum state, we call

µk(χ) :=Z dµ(x)px Tr[ ˆχk

x],

the k-th moment of χ. For any pure state φ, the index of
coincidence γk is deﬁned as

γk(χ, φ) :=Z dµ(x)px hφ| ˆχ⊗k

x |φi .

Operationally, a projective quantum t design ensemble
is an ensemble x 7→ φx := px ˆφx of pure states that
cannot be discriminated from the uniformly distributed
ensemble of pure states – other than by trivial guess-
ing – when given t copies. Analogously, a project-
ive quantum t design POVM is operationally deﬁned
as a POVM y 7→ πy := qy ˆπy such that the ensemble
φy := Tr2[Φ+(11 ⊗ πy)] = 1
d πy steered on a maxim-

ally mixed state |Φ+i := 1√dPi |i, ii is a projective

quantum t design ensemble. More generally, a project-
ive quantum t design is deﬁned as a measurable func-
tion φ from A to rank-one positive semideﬁnite operators
x 7→ φx := νpx ˆφx such that

We introduce mixed t designs as a generalization of
projective t designs that relax the constraint on being
rank-one projectors while preserving indistinguishability
from the uniform distribution given t copies. Operation-
ally, we deﬁne mixed t design ensembles x 7→ ρx := px ˆρx
as ensembles of (possibly) mixed states that cannot be
distinguished from the uniform distribution given t cop-
ies. Analogously, we operationally deﬁne mixed t design
POVMs such that the ensemble steered over a maxim-
ally entangled state is a mixed t design ensemble. More
generally, we deﬁne mixed quantum t designs as follows.

Deﬁnition 1 (Mixed t design). We call a mixed quantum
t design any measurable function χ from A to positive
semideﬁnite operators x 7→ χx := νpx ˆχx, where x 7→ px
is a probability density (with respect to µ) if

Z dµ(x)px ˆχ⊗t

x :=Z dg(Ug ˆχU†g )⊗t,

(1)

where dg is the Haar probability measure on U (d) and ˆχ
is some unit-trace positive-semideﬁnite operator.

In the following, for brevity we refer to mixed t designs
simply as t designs. Let us prove some important prop-
erties of t designs. Notice that by partial tracing Eq. (1)
it immediately follows that any t design is also a k design
for any 1 ≤ k ≤ t, and therefore in particular

Z dµ(x)px ˆχx =

11
d

,

for any t design χ.

The moments up to t of any t design χ are given by

µk(χ) = Tr[ ˆχk].

(2)

for any 1 ≤ k ≤ t. This uniquely identiﬁes ˆχ up to
unitaries if t ≥ d. Equation (2) can be readily veriﬁed
by ﬁrst multiplying Eq. (1) by the shift operator St :=
j=1 |ij⊕1i hij| that replaces the state of Hj⊕1

with Hj (here ⊕ denotes sum modulus t and {|iji}d
i=1
is an orthonormal basis of space Hj), and then tracing
using the property of the shift operator that Tr[StV ⊗t] =
Tr[V t] for any t and any Hermitian operator V .

Pi1,...itNt

For quantum t designs χ it follows from the deﬁnition
that for any 1 ≤ k ≤ t the index of coincidence γk is
independent of φ and is given by

γk(χ) =(cid:18)d + k − 1

where Pk denotes the projector over the symmetric sub-
space of H⊗k, xi := (i − 1)! Tr[ ˆχi], and Bk(x1, . . . xk)
is the complete exponential Bell polynomial [34]. The
second equality follows from a lengthy but straightfor-
ward counting argument. Therefore explicitly for k ∈

Relevant classes of t designs include symmetric, in-

Let us ﬁrst recall some standard deﬁnitions and facts
from statistics [35]. A measure of the distance between
any two given probability densities p and q on A (with

respect to µ) is given by the relative entropy D(cid:18)p(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

D(cid:18)p(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

A measure of the correlation between any two given ran-
dom variables X and Y distributed according to the joint
probability density p(X,Y ), is given by the mutual inform-
ation I(X; Y ) deﬁned as

for any x, y, x′, and y′ deﬁnes a set {χx,y}x,y which we
call a mutually unbiased set. For simplicity, we use the
notation χx,y = χdx+y.

An explicit way to construct families of mixed t designs
is by aﬃne combination of any mixed t design x 7→ χx :=
px ˆχx with the maximally mixed operator as follow:

Dλ(χx) = λχx + (1 − λ) Tr[χx]

11

,

for any λ such that Dλ(χx) ≥ 0 ∀x, as follows by applying
D⊗t
λ to both sides of Eq. (1) and noticing that the map Dλ
commutes with any unitary channel. More precisely, let

ˆχx := Pk αx,k |φx,ki hφx,k| be a spectral decomposition

and let αmax := maxx,k αx,k and αmin := minx,k αx,k.
Then by direct inspection it follows that Dλ(χx) ≥ 0 if

Furthermore,

Then it follows that the depolarized version of any
t design is a t design.
for any t
design χ, we deﬁne the corresponding anti t design as
D(1−dαmax)−1 (χ). Notice that due to Eq. (4) any anti t
design is a t design. Finally one has the following simple
relation between the moments of any t design χ and those
of its depolarized version Dλ(χ):

where pX and pY are the marginal probability distribu-
tions. For any ensemble ρ and POVM π we denote with
I(ρ, π) the mutual information I(X; Y ) between random
variables X and Y distributed according to (x, y) 7→
px,y := Tr[ρxπy].

Following Ref. [3], we deﬁne the capacity of any POVM

as follows.

Deﬁnition 2 (Unassisted classical capacity of POVMs).
The unassisted classical capacity of any POVM π is given
by

The operational

interpretation of Deﬁnition 2 is
provided by Shannon’s noisy-channel
coding the-
orem [36], which proves that the capacity represents the
maximum amount of information that can be reliably
conveyed through POVM π per use of the device, in the
asymptotic limit.

Its explicit computation is in general very challenging.
To proceed, let us ﬁrst notice that the problem can be
simpliﬁed as follows

C(π) = W (π) := max

ρ

I(ρ, π),

(5)

where W (π) is the informational power [1–10] of POVM
π, respectively, and its additivity has been proved in
Ref. [1].

A further simpliﬁcation in the calculation of W (π) fol-
lows from the fact that, without loss of generality, the
maximum in Eq. (5) can be taken over pure ensembles,
as proved in Ref. [1].

We can now introduce the following important prelim-

inary result.

Lemma 1. The capacity C(π) of any POVM y 7→ dqy ˆπy
is upper bounded by

whenever there exists a probability density x 7→ px such
that σ = 11/d and all the states ˆφx optimize Eq. (6).

Proof. For any pure ensemble x 7→ φx := px | ˆφxi h ˆφx|, let

I(φx, πy)

σ :=R dµ(x)px ˆφx be the average state. Then one has

Since one has

Tr[σˆπy]

it follows that

From the non-negativity of the relative entropy one has

qy(cid:19) .

I(φx, πy)

D(cid:18)dqy h ˆφx| ˆπy | ˆφxi(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where the last inequality follows from upper bounding
the average with the largest element. Notice that both in-
equalities are saturated iﬀ Tr[σˆπy] = 1/d which is fulﬁlled

qy(cid:19) ,

Notice that, as a trivial consequence of Holevo’s the-
orem [41], the quantity ln d − C(π), for which Lemma 1
provides a lower bound, can be interpreted as a measure
of how suboptimal measurement π is for communication
tasks.

The maximization of the communication capacity can
now be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed in some cases. Indeed, let
us set a := miny,ψ hψ| ˆπy |ψi, b := maxy,ψ hψ| ˆπy |ψi, and
let r : [a, b] → R be the Hermite interpolating polynomial
of η such that the assumptions of Lemma 3 in the Ap-
pendix are fulﬁlled (and so r interpolates η from below).
Then

Z dµ(y)pyη(hφ| ˆπy |φi) ≥Z dµ(y)pyr(hφ| ˆπy |φi) =: Q(φ),

with equality if and only if φ is such that all the points of
interpolation xi are of the form hφ| ˆπy |φi (then necessar-
ily the set of all overlaps {hφ| ˆπy |φi}y∈A has to be ﬁnite).
In consequence, we get

C(π) ≤ ln d − min

φ

Q(φ).

Let us now assume that we have some predictions about
the state that minimizes the lhs of the ﬁrst inequality and
let φ0 be the supposed minimizer. Then, if the points of
interpolation are chosen to be {hφ0| ˆπy |φ0i}y∈A, in order
to show that φ0 is indeed a minimizer, it is enough to
show that φ0 minimizes Q. In particular, this becomes
trivial whenever Q(φ) is constant.
In consequence, we
get the equality in the second inequality exactly as in
Lemma 1. The remainder of this work is devoted to the
quantiﬁcation of C(π) through the optimization of Q(φ),
for the speciﬁc case of t designs.

C. Main results

Our ﬁrst main result is an upper bound on the capa-
city C(π) of any t design POVM π, as a function of the
dimension and of the indices of coincidence γk(χ) (or,
equivalently, of the moments µk(π)), for t ∈ [1, 5].

Notice that, as expected, the bounds in Theorem 1

Moreover, the optimal ensembles for the depolarized ver-
sions of π are exactly the same as for π and they all
average to the maximally mixed state.

Proof. It is well known that all the rank-one POVMs π
included in the theorem are projective t designs, with
t = 3 if π is a 2-dimensional complete MUB, t = 5 if π
is an icosahedron, t = ∞ if π is the uniform distribution,
and t = 2 otherwise.
It is easy to observe that the d-
dimensional anti-SIC is a mixed 2-design. Thus, due to
Eq. (4), Dλ(π) is also a t design.

Let us ﬁrst discuss the case where t is ﬁnite. Let us
recall what the optimal ensembles are for POVMs π, as
given in Refs. [5–10]. We get the dual tetrahedron for tet-
rahedral SIC and ’dual’ Hoggar lines for the Hoggar SIC,
(the same) octahedron and icosahedron for octahedral
and icosahedral POVMs, respectively, the Hesse SIC for
3-dimensional complete MUB and ﬁnally an orthonormal
basis consisting of states orthogonal to exactly 3 diﬀerent
πy for generic 3-dimensional SIC or the complete MUB
for the Hesse SIC (note that the existence of such a basis
[38] for the group-covariant (Weyl-
was proved in Ref.
Heisenberg) case while just recently Ref.
[39] gave the
proof that there are no other qutrit SICs). We shall also

show that for the anti-SIC, the optimal ensemble is given
by the SIC itself. Notice that all these ensembles average
to the maximally mixed state.

For any state φ of such an ensemble one has

hφ| ˆπy |φi =


x0 × m0,
. . .
xl × ml

,

where x1 ≤ · · · ≤ xl, x1 = 0 and xl = 1 whenever t is
odd. Here the notation xk × mk denotes the value xk
with multiplicity mk. Moreover, in all these cases there
are exactly ⌈ t
2 ⌉.
Therefore one has

2 ⌉ + 1 diﬀerent values of xk, thus l := ⌈ t

hφ| Dλ(ˆπ) |φi =

Notice that

Therefore, according to Lemma 3, the Hermite inter-
polating polynomial r such that r(xk) = η(xk) for any
k ∈ [0, ⌈ t

is such that deg r ≤ t and r(x) ≤ η(x) for any x ∈

mial has to be constant and according to our remarks at

by φ.

Notice that, as expected, the capacities in Theorem 2
reduce to those given in Refs. [1, 5–10, 45] for projective

The results of Theorems 1 and 2 are represented in
Figs. 1, 2, and 3, in the 2-, 3-, and 8-dimensional cases,
respectively.

Finally,

let us notice that the capacity C(π) of
any measurement π can be expressed in terms of
the well-known accessible information [40–46] A(ρ) :=
maxπ I(ρ, π) of ensemble ρ, where the maximum is
over any POVM π. The relation is given by C(π) =
maxσ A(σ1/2πσ1/2), where by σ1/2πσ1/2 we mean the
ensemble y 7→ 1
d σ1/2πyσ1/2 and the maximum is taken
over all states σ. Therefore, in general one has W (π) ≥
A( 1
d π), and thus the upper bound on C(π) provided
in Thm. 1 also upper bounds the accessible informa-
tion A( 1
d π). Moreover, whenever the ensemble attain-

III. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

In this work we introduced mixed t design quantum en-
sembles and measurements as the most general arbitrary-
rank extension of projective t designs that preserves in-
distinguishability from the uniform distribution given t
copies. We addressed the problem of quantifying the
communication capacity of mixed t design measurements
by deriving upper bounds on such a quantity for any
t ∈ [1, 5]. We reﬁned our results by providing a closed-
form solution for the communication capacity of several
mixed t designs measurements, including the depolarized
version of: any qubit and qutrit SIC and MUBs, any
qubit icosahedral measurement, any Hoggar SIC, and the
uniform distribution.

One might conjecture that the quantiﬁcation of the
communication capacity of mixed (t = ∞)-design meas-
urements would shine new light on the problem of lower
bounding the communication capacity of mixed quantum
POVMs, in the same way as the quantiﬁcation [45] of
the accessible information of projective (t = ∞)-designs
allowed for the computation of a lower bound on the ac-
cessible information of ensembles of pure states.

Appendix A: Hermite interpolation

In this section we describe brieﬂy the optimization
method based on Hermite interpolation, ﬁrst introduced
in this context and discussed in detail in Ref. [5]. Let
us ﬁrst recall the well known formula for the Hermite
interpolation error.

Lemma 2. Let a ≤ x0 < · · · < xm−1 ≤ b be reals and let
{ji}m−1
i=0 be positive integers. Let η(x) be a real function
with at least t + 1 continuous derivatives on [a, b] and let
q(x) be its Hermite interpolating polynomial, namely the

polynomial of degree at most t := Pi ji − 1 that agrees

with η(x) at xi up to derivative of order ji − 1 for all i,
i.e.

q(k)(xi) = η(k)(xi),

∀0 ≤ k ≤ ji − 1, 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1.

there exists x′ such that

Then for any x ∈ [a, b]
min(x, x0) < x′ < max(x, xm−1) and
m−1
Yi=0

η(t+1)(x′)
(t + 1)!

η(x) − q(x) =

(x − xi)ji .

Proof. See, e.g. Ref. [47].

In this work we set η(x) := −x ln(x).

Lemma 3. Let m ≥ 2, x0 = a and j0 = 1. Then
whenever

a. xm−1 = b, jm−1 = 1 and ji = 2 for 0 < i < m − 1, or
b. xm−1 < b, and ji = 2 for 0 < i,
one has η(x) − q(x) ≥ 0 for any x ∈ [a, b].

Proof. The proof was ﬁrst derived in Ref. [5]. We report
it here for clarity.

a. In this case one has

(x − xi)ji = (x − a)(x − b)

(x − xi)2 ≤ 0.
