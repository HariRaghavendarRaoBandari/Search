An accurate and consistent theory of phonons in metals requires that all long-range Coulomb
interactions between charged particles (electrons and ions) be treated on equal footing. So far, all
attempts to deal with this non-perturbative problem were relying on uncontrolled approximations
in the absence of small parameters.
In this work, we present the ﬁrst demonstration that the
Diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique does provide a solution with controlled accuracy by computing
vertex corrections from higher-order skeleton graphs. We calculate the spectrum of longitudinal
acoustic phonons in a simple cubic lattice, determine their sound velocity, and obtain the phonon
spectral densities by analytic continuation of the Matsubara Green’s functions. Final results are
checked against the lowest-order fully self-consistent GW-approximation in both adiabatic and non-
adiabatic regimes.

Standard theory of electron-phonon interaction (EPI)
in metals involves a number of approximations. While
some of them are based on the small adiabatic parame-
ter γ = ωD/ǫF ∼ pm/M ≪ 1 (where ωD is the Debye
frequency, ǫF is the Fermi energy, m and M are the elec-
tron and ion masses, respectively), other approximations
remain uncontrolled. The main diﬃculty is linked to the
observation that EPI in metals cannot be separated from
strong Coulomb forces between the electrons. Indeed, un-
screened interactions between the ions prevent formation
of longitudinal acoustic phonons because their energies
are shifted all the way up to the ionic plasma frequency,
ωp = p4πnee2/M ǫ∞, where ne = ni is the conduction
electron/ion charge density and ǫ∞ is the ion-core di-
electric constant. Once the long-range electron-phonon
and Coulomb interactions between the electrons are ac-
counted for, the acoustic spectrum is recovered back due
to screening [1].

In the adiabatic approximation it is assumed that
all interactions between (and with) the heavy ions are
screened by the static dielectric function of a metal,
ǫ(k, ω = 0), and the phonon spectrum is determined from
the corresponding dynamic matrix of a solid. Thus trans-
formed crystal vibrations and EPI are no longer singu-
lar at small momenta. When further progress is made
by separating eﬀects of electron-electron and electron-
phonon interactions [2, 3], double-counting is dealt with
approximately by excluding static electronic polarization
terms from the renormalization of phonon propagators,
and vertex corrections based on EPI are neglected be-
cause they are small in γ. These approximations break
down when γ ≥ 1 is considered to explain enhancement
of the critical temperature in phonon-mediated supercon-
ductors [4–6].

mains strong and does not involve natural small param-
eters in materials. In particular, it successfully competes
with Coulomb repulsion by mediating s-wave supercon-
ductivity in numerous systems. This literally means
that even the ﬁrst step in the adiabatic approximation
(screening of long-range interactions) is ill-deﬁned since
the static dielectric function itself should be the outcome
of the non-perturbative calculation based on all relevant
interactions, including EPI.

The importance of EPI-based vertex corrections was
studied by various groups in application to superconduc-
tors [7–9], Dirac materials [10], and polarons [11, 12],
but never in a systematic way when all long-range forces
are treated on an equal footing and all uncertainties are
quantiﬁed. In this letter, we describe the bold-line Dia-
grammatic Monte Carlo (BDMC) technique that allows
us to deal with all Coulomb interactions in a fully self-
consistent way and obtain ﬁnal results with controlled
accuracy by accounting for relevant vertex corrections
from higher-order skeleton diagrams. Our model simu-
lation considers a simple cubic lattice of vibrating ions
coupled to conduction electrons, and aims at computing
the spectrum of longitudinal phonons and their velocity
of sound in the thermodynamic limit. We also perform
spectral analysis of the phonon Matsubara Green’s func-
tion in the most diﬃcult parameter regime γ ∼ 1 where
the adiabatic approximation starts to break down. We
show that vertex corrections to the lowest-order (GW)
approximation signiﬁcantly soften the sound velocity at
γ & 1, and reduce the amplitude of the giant Kohn
anomaly at small γ. As far as we know, this kind of
studies were simply not possible to perform in the past.

However, regardless of the γ parameter value, EPI re-

Our interacting lattice model of a metal is deﬁned by

the Hamiltonian

H = HF H + Hc + Hph + Hel−ph ,

(1)

where HF H is the standard Fermi-Hubbard model on a
simple cubic lattice. It is parameterized by the n.n. hop-
ping amplitude t (leading to the tight-binding dispersion
relation ǫ(k)), the on-site repulsion U , and the chemical
potential µ. In what follows we use the lattice constant a
and hopping t as units of length and energy, respectively.
The second term describes Coulomb electron-electron
interaction, Hc = Pi<j,σ,σ′ Vc(rij ) niσnjσ′ , where niσ =
a†
iσaiσ is the electron density operator for the spin com-
ponent σ =↑, ↓ on site i (here and below we employ stan-
dard second-quantization notations for creation and an-
nihilation operators), and Vc(rij ) = Uc/|i − j|; in Fourier
space, Vc(q → 0) = 4πUc/q2. We consider Uc = e2/ǫ∞ as
an independent (from U ) parameter; the bare electron-
electron interaction is deﬁned as the sum of local and
non-local terms: Vee(rij ) = U δrij + Vc(rij ).

The Hamiltonian of ionic system is assumed to be
harmonic and described by a collection of longitudinal
phonons [13], Hph = Pq ω(q)b†
qbq. Their spectrum is
gapped at small momenta: ω(q → 0) = ωp.

The electron-ion interaction has the standard density-

displacement form,

Hel−ph = i X

(with respect to cutting one line) diagrams for self-energy
Σ and polarization function Π are expressed in terms
of fully-dressed Green’s functions, G, and screened in-
teractions, W , that are deﬁned self-consistently through
Dyson equations in the Matsubara frequency-momentum
representation (for brevity, we do not explicitly mention
the tensor structure of irreducible objects, interactions,
and propagators in the spin space):

G−1 = G−1

0 − Σ ,

W −1 = ¯V −1 − Π .

(3)

0 = [ω2

0 = iωn + µ − ǫ(k) and D−1

Here G−1
m +
ω2(q)]/2ω(q), are the bare electron and phonon Green’s
functions, respectively. Their Matsubara frequencies are
deﬁned diﬀerently:
for fermions, ωn = 2πT (n + 1/2)
with integer n; for bosons, ωm = 2πT m with integer
m. Within the G2W -expansion framework, one has to
combine the bare electron-electron potential with the
phonon-mediated term to form the frequency-dependent
potential ¯V = Vee −D0Vep appearing in the second Dyson
equation. This formulation is complete in a sense that
exponential convergence of the skeleton sequences with
increasing the diagram order leads to the ﬁnal solution
of the problem [14].

To determine properties of the phonon subsystem, we
ﬁrst deﬁne the polarization function irreducible with re-
spect to cutting one phonon line

By construction, in combination with Vep, it serves as
an irreducible self-energy for the renormalized phonon
propagator

D−1 = D−1

0 − Σph;

Σph = −VepΠP .

Our implementation of the BDMC technique is closely
following that described in Ref. [15]. We sample the
conﬁguration space of the irreducible [16] skeleton free-
energy diagrams in the (r, τ )-representation with one of
the lines always being marked (by red cross in Fig.1(b-
c)) as the “measuring” one; its functional dependence
on space-time coordinates of its end-points is arbitrary.
When the “measuring line” is removed, the remain-
ing diagram contributes either to Π, see Fig. 1(b), or
to Σ, see Fig.1(c).
In the imaginary-time represen-
tation, we need to split W into the sum of the bare
electron-electron potential, Vee(rij )δ(τ1 − τ2), and the
rest, W − Vee(rij )δ(τ1 − τ2), because δ-functional and
generic functional dependencies on time are incompati-
ble. This implies, in particular, that the measuring line
cannot be of the Vee-type [15].

Both Σ and Π are computed as sums of skeleton
graphs, up to order N (there are 2N vertexes in the N -th
order graph); we will denote these sums as ΣN and ΠN .
The lowest-order contributions are known right away be-
cause they are nothing but products of G and W func-
tions; in the skeleton formulation, Σ1 and Π1 are equiva-
lent to the GW-approximation with fully self-consistent

with the interaction vertex M (q) based on the derivative
of the Coulomb electron-ion potential. Since in all ex-
pressions we always have to deal with |M (q)|2, it makes
sense to introduce Vep(q) = |M (q)|2 whose asymptotic
form [ωp/2]Vc(q) at q → 0 is unambiguously ﬁxed by
electro-neutrality of the system. Solely for the purpose
of minimizing the number of model parameters, we con-
ﬁne ourselves to ω(q) = ωp and Vep(r) = (ωp/2)Vee(r)
with ωp/t = 0.5.

treatment of EPI eﬀects on polarization. By charge neu-
trality, Hartree terms involving Vc(r 6= 0) have to be re-
moved. Thus, Monte Carlo statistics has to be collected
only from higher-order diagrams and then added to the
GW-result. The self-consistency loop is closed after Σ
and Π are used in Dyson equations to deﬁne new G and
W functions that are subsequently used in all diagrams
as the simulation continues. To solve Dyson equations
(3-5) we employ Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithms to go
to the momentum-frequency representation where these
equations are algebraic.

FIG. 2: Convergence properties of the skeleton sequence for
system size L = 16 (other parameters are speciﬁed in the
legends).
In the left panel the local polarization Π(0, τ ) =
Pσ Πσσ(r = 0, τ ) and its order-by-order contributions are
shown as functions of τ to demonstrate that Π3 result (red
line) is an order of magnitude larger than its partial contri-
bution from diagrams of the second order (blue); third-order
diagrams make an even smaller contribution (green line). In
the right panel an identical analysis is presented for local self-
energy Σσ(0, τ ) = Σ↑(0, τ ) = Σ↓(0, τ ), with the same color
scheme meaning.

The largest system size simulated in this work was
L3 = 643, with periodic boundary conditions. The ther-
modynamic limit was recovered by extrapolating results
obtained for L = 16, 32, and 64 to inﬁnity. We also
have to perform an extrapolation to the N → ∞ limit,
or observe good convergence of results with increasing
N .
In two panels of Fig.2 we plot local polarization
Π(r = 0, τ ) and self-energy Σσ(r = 0, τ ) along with their
partial order-by-order contributions. Clearly, contribu-
tions from the third-order skeleton graphs are already
very small, but understanding their role is required for
estimating accuracy limits of calculations truncated at
N = 2.

Results. The tight-binding model on a simple cubic
lattice at half-ﬁlling satisﬁes the “nesting” condition at
momentum QN = (π, π, π). This leads to singularity in
the density of states, logarithmic divergence of polariza-
tion at zero temperature, Π(q → QN ) ∼ ln |q−QN |, and
the corresponding “giant” Kohn anomaly in the phonon
spectrum (typical for one-dimensional systems) [17]. It is
expected then that at low temperature the phonon spec-
trum is anomalously soft at QN and there is a structural
phase transition with the dominant density modulation

3

at QN . In contrast, the conventional Kohn anomaly is
linked to the logarithmic divergence of the polarization
derivative ∂Π/∂q at momentum transfer q = 2kF (at
T = 0).

In Fig. 3 we show the dramatic temperature depen-
dence of the renormalized phonon dispersion Ω(q) (along
the h111i direction) at half-ﬁlling. The spectrum was
deduced from poles of D, see Eqs.(5). As temperature
decreases, the cusp at QN is getting more and more pro-
nounced and the phonon spectrum softens; temperature
scales (appropriate system sizes) required for studying
the structural transition point are exponentially small
(large) in this case. Note that vertex corrections substan-
tially reduce the amplitude of the Giant Kohn anomaly,
see inset in Fig. 3, but do not eliminating it. [Within the
GW-approximation the phonon spectrum goes unstable
at T . 0.03 already.]

FIG. 3: Giant Kohn anomaly in the renormalized phonon
spectrum Ω(q) at the nesting vector QN = (π, π, π) for L =
32, ne = 1, and N = 2. In the inset we show how Ω(q) at
T /t = 0.1 depends on the diagram order: GW-approximation
(magenta), N = 2 (blue).

Away from half-ﬁlling, the phonon spectrum should
demonstrate the standard Kohn anomaly at q = 2kF
smeared by ﬁnite-temperature eﬀects.
It can be seen,
for instance, as a wiggle on the phonon dispersion curve
corresponding to density ne = 0.7 in the momentum in-
terval 4.5 < q < 5 (at this ﬁlling factor, kF ≈ 2.4 along
the h111i direction), see the main plot in Fig.4.

As far as screening eﬀects are concerned, the plasmon
gap at q → 0 is closed at all densities, and Ω(q → 0)
clearly demonstrates the characteristic sound-wave de-
pendence csq, see Figs. 3 and 4. When ne decreases
(at constant Uc and ωp this implies that ions are getting
lighter, M = (4πUc/ω2
p)ne) the spectrum at large val-
ues of q > 2kF saturates at ωp, see the main panel in
Fig.4, and the sound velocity increases, see Fig.4 inset.
This behavior is in complete agreement with the Fermi-
liquid theory prediction cs ∝ (kF /m)pm/M ∝ n−1/6
at
constant plasma frequency.

Near half-ﬁlling, ne & 0.5, where the adiabatic pa-
rameter is small, γ . 0.1, the eﬀect of higher-order ver-
tex corrections on sound velocity appears to be small,
and phonon spectra at small momenta are indistinguish-
able within the error bars (this is not the case for large
momenta, especially at QN , see the inset in Fig.3). As
expected, higher-order diagrams start playing a role at
low density when the adiabatic parameter is approach-
ing unity. In the inset of Fig.4 we show how the sound
velocity depends on γ and how strong the eﬀect of vertex
corrections is. At densities ne . 0.2 (or γ & 0.2) the
GW-approximation becomes rather unsatisfactory.

approximation (red) and with N = 2 vertex corrections
(blue). Both curves are extrapolated to the thermodynamic
limit from the L = 16, 32, 64 set. Error bars are smaller
than symbol sizes.

To gain additional information on dynamic properties
of phonons, we perform analytic continuation of the Mat-
subara Green’s function D(q, τ ) into the real frequency
domain. This is done by a combination of the unbi-
ased stochastic optimization and consistent constraints
methods [18, 19].
In Fig.5 we show the phonon spec-
tral function for several values of momenta along the
h111i direction at T = ωp/2 = 0.25t, and compare GW
with N = 2 results. This is done in the most diﬃcult
low-density limit ne = 0.025 where γ ∼ 1. Note the
large width of phonon peaks that is often comparable to
their energies. Strong damping of longitudinal phonons
is an inevitable property accompanying screening of long
range interactions, which has been observed in metals
since early neutron scattering experiments [20]. Rather
counter-intuitively the phonon damping is the strongest
at small momenta, while at larger values of q the phonon
life-time is much longer (except near the Brillouin zone
boundary (q = 5.44) where the line-time slightly de-
creases again). For the three largest values of q > 2kF ,
the phonon energy (ﬁrst moment of the spectral function)

saturates at ωp, in accordance with Fig.4.

Conclusions. We developed the BDMC technique to
deal consistently and accurately with all Coulomb inter-
actions in a metal. We ﬁnd that the skeleton sequence
converges fast for our parameters, and if ﬁnal results are
desired with accuracy of the order of one percent then it
is suﬃcient to account only for the lowest order vertex
corrections in most cases. To arrive at this conclusion,
we had to quantify the contributions from higher-order
graphs.

We demonstrated that our calculations capture the
essence of all screening eﬀects in metals, and allow precise
calculations of the renormalized phonon spectrum and
sound velocity for all values of the adiabatic parameter
γ. In this work we focused on basic principles and dis-
cussed only the longitudinal acoustic phonons; including
other phonon branches is left for future work but we do
not see any diﬃculty in this regard. The other important
generalization would be to implement this treatment for
multi-orbital systems in view of applications in material
science.
