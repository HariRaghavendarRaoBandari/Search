FOUR-DIMENSIONAL GRADIENT SHRINKING SOLITONS WITH

POSITIVE ISOTROPIC CURVATURE

XIAOLONG LI, LEI NI, AND KUI WANG

Abstract. We show that a four-dimensional complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton
with positive isotropic curvature is either a quotient of S4 or a quotient of S3 × R. This
gives a clean classiﬁcation result removing the earlier additional assumptions in [13] by
Wallach and the second author.

1. Introduction

A gradient shrinking Ricci soliton is a triple (M, g, f ), a complete Riemannian manifold

with a smooth potential function f whose Hessian satisfying

(1.1)

Ric +∇∇f =

1
2

g.

The gradient shrinking soliton arises naturally in the study of the singularity analysis of the
Ricci ﬂow [3, 14]. It also attracts the study since (1.1) generalizes the Einstein metrics. The
main purpose of this article concerns a classiﬁcation of such four-manifolds with positive
isotropic curvature. The positive isotropic curvature condition was ﬁrst introduced by Mi-
calleﬀ and Moore [6] in applying the index computation of harmonic spheres to the study of
the topology of manifolds. The Ricci ﬂow on four-manifolds with positive isotropic curvature
was studied by Hamilton [4]. This condition was proven to be invariant under Ricci ﬂow
in dimension four by Hamilton and in high dimensions by Brendle-Schoen [1] and Nguyen
[11].
It is hence then interesting to understand the solitons under the positive isotropic
curvature condition. In [13], Wallach and the second author classiﬁed the four-dimensional
gradient shrinking solitons under some extra assumptions, including the nonnegative cur-
vature operator, a pinching condition and a curvature growth condition. Since then, there
have been much progresses in understanding the general shrinking solitons [2, 5, 7, 9, 10] and
particularly the four-dimensional ones [8]. In particular, a classiﬁcation result was obtained
in [9] for solitons with nonnegative curvature operator for all dimensions. The purpose of
this article is to prove the following classiﬁcation result on shrinking solitons with positive
isotropic curvature by removing all the additional assumptions in [13].

Theorem 1.1. Any four dimensional complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton with positive

isotropic curvature is either a quotient of S4 or a quotient of S3 × R.
It remains an interesting question whether or not the same result holds in high dimensions.

We plan to return to this in the future.

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we collect some results on gradient shrinking Ricci solitons that will be

used in this paper.

After normalizing the potential function f via translating, we have the following identities

[3]:

Lemma 2.1.

,

S + ∆f =

n
2
S + |∇f|2 = f,

where S denotes the scalar curvature of M .

Regarding the growth of the potential function f and the volume of geodesic balls, Cao

and Zhou [2] showed that

Lemma 2.2. Let (M n, g) be a complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton of dimension n and
p ∈ M . Then there are positive constants c1, c2 and C such that

1
4

(d(x, p) − c1)2

+ ≤ f (x) ≤

1
4

(d(x, p) + c2)2 ,

Vol(Bp(r)) ≤ Crn.

Munteanu and Sesum [7] proved the following integral bound for the Ricci curvature.

Lemma 2.3. Let (M, g) be a complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton. Then for any λ > 0,
we have

ˆM | Ric|2e−λf < ∞.

The above mentioned results are valid in all dimensions. In the following, we recall some
special properties in four dimension. It is well known that, in dimension four, the curvature
operator R can be written as

R =(cid:18) A B
Bt C(cid:19)

according to the natural splitting ∧2(R4) = ∧+ ⊕ ∧−, where ∧+ and ∧− are the self-dual
and anti-self-dual parts respectively. It is easy to see that A and C are symmetric. Denote
A1 ≤ A2 ≤ A3 and C1 ≤ C2 ≤ C3 the eigenvalues of A and C, respectively. Also let B1 ≤
B2 ≤ B3 be the singular eigenvalues of B. Note that a direct consequence of the ﬁrst Bianchi
identity is that tr(A) = tr(C) = S
4 , where S is the scalar curvature. In [13], Wallach and the
◦Ric can be expressed in terms of components of B, where ◦Ric
second author computed that
is the traceless part of the Ricci tensor. In particular, 4kBk2 = |
i = 24 det B,
where λi’s are the eigenvalues of ◦Ric. It was also observed in [13, Proposition 3.1] that these
components of the curvature operator satisfy certain diﬀerential inequalities, which play a
signiﬁcant role in the classiﬁcation results.

Proposition 2.1. If (M, g(t)) is a solution to the Ricci ﬂow, then we have the following
diﬀerential inequalities

in the distributional sense.

We now summarize the ideas used to prove the classiﬁcation result in [13] and explain our
strategy of removing all the assumptions except positive isotropic curvature. First of all, it
was shown in [12, Proposition 4.2] that if S 6= 0, then
∂t − ∆(cid:19)(cid:18)|Rijkl|2

where P is deﬁned by

P = 4ShR2 + R♯, Ri − | Ric|2|Rijkl|2.

Here # is the operator deﬁned using the Lie algebraic structure of ∧2TpM (see for example
[3]). Under a certain curvature growth assumption, the classiﬁcation result follows from
the proof of the main theorem in [12] if one can show that P ≤ 0. In dimension four, P
can be expressed in terms of A, B and C. Let ◦A and ◦C be the traceless parts of A and C,
respectively. By choosing suitable basis of ∧+ and ∧−, we may diagonalize ◦A and ◦C such

that

A key observation in [13] is that for several basic examples, one always has BBt = b2 id
(A1+A2)2(C1+C2)2 and
and P = 0. By considering the evolution equation of the quantity
applying integration by parts, Wallach and the second author proved that BBt = b2 id

is indeed valid for all four-dimensional shrinking Ricci solitons satisfying two very weak
curvature assumptions:

(2.1)

(2.2)

B2
3

(A1 + A2)(C1 + C2)

(x) ≤ exp(a(r(x) + 1)),

|Rijkl|(x) ≤ exp(a(r(x) + 1))

for some a > 0, where r(x) is the distance function to a ﬁxed point on the manifold. These
two assumptions are only needed to ensure that all the integrals involved in the integration
by parts argument are ﬁnite. To remove these two curvature assumptions, we show that
BBt = b2 id in fact holds on all four-dimensional shrinking Ricci solitons. Our strategy is
to consider the evolution equation of
and sharpen the integration by parts

B3

√(A1+A2)(C1+C2)

argument in [13]. In the proof, in order to guarantee that all the integrals involved are ﬁnite,
we use the integral bound of the Ricci curvature in Lemma 2.3.

Now under the assumption BBt = b2 id, P has a much simpler expression:

Then by further assuming that M has nonnegative curvature operator, namely, A and C

By solving another optimization problem under weaker constraints, we achieve in this
paper that P ≤ 0 without assuming M has nonnegative curvature operator. In the last step
we also sharpen the integration by parts argument in [12] instead of appealing the result in
[12] as in [13] since we no longer assume a curvature growth condition (2.2). These three
improvements allow us to prove the main result without any additional assumptions.

3. Proof of Theorem 1.1

For brevity, we introduce the same notations as in [13]: ψ1 = A1 + A2, ψ2 = C1 + C2,

ϕ = B3 and

−E = −

−

(A1 − B1)2 + (A2 − B2)2 + 2A2(B2 − B1)

A1 + A2
(C1 − B1)2 + (C2 − B2)2 + 2C2(B2 − B1)

−

B3

.

C1 + C2

It is clear that −E ≤ 0 with equality holds only if A1 = C1 = B1 = B2 = A2 = C2 = B3.
In particular we have BBt = b2 id for some b. Also notice that M has positive isotropic
curvature amounts to ψ1 > 0 and ψ2 > 0.

Proposition 3.1. The following diﬀerential inequality holds in the sense of distribution:

Trying to use integration by parts here would require a stronger integral bound of the Ricci
curvature than we actually have in Lemma 2.3. To overcome this diﬃculty, we adopt a
similar idea that was used to prove BBt = b2 id. We consider, instead, u = |Rijkl|

T = Rijkl

Therefore we know that u is a positive constant and P = 0 by letting r → ∞. Then it

proof of the main theorem in [12].

(cid:3)

The strong maximum principle together with the classiﬁcation of positive case implies the

following corollary for the solitons with nonnegative isotropic curvature.

Corollary 3.1. If (M, g, f ) is a complete gradient shrinking soliton with nonnegative isotropic
curvature then its universal cover must be one of the following spaces S4, CP 2, S2 × S2,
S2 × R2 and S3 × R.
