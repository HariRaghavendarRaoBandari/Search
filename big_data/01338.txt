Given a multi-variant polynomial inequality with a parameter, how to ﬁnd the best
possible value of this parameter that satisﬁes the inequality? For instance, ﬁnd the
greatest number k that satisﬁes a3+b3+c3+k(a2b+b2c+c2a)−(k+1)(ab2+bc2+ca2) ≥ 0
for all nonnegative real numbers a, b, c. Analogues problems often appeared in studies of
inequalities and were dealt with by various methods. In this paper, a general algorithm
is proposed for ﬁnding the required best possible constant. The algorithm can be easily
implemented by computer algebra tools such as Maple.

1 Construct a set including all critical values

This paper is aimed at the kind of problems as the following:

Problem 1. Given a polynomial F (k, x, y, z), ﬁnd the greatest number k that

satisﬁes F ≥ 0 for all real numbers x, y, z.

Constraint F ≥ 0 deﬁne a closed set, so the greatest or least value of k can only be

reached on the boundary F (k, x, y, z) = 0.

Therefore, the required greatest number must be a critical value of k where k is taken

as an implicit function deﬁned by F (k, x, y, z) = 0.

Based on the above consideration, the suggested procedure of solving Problem 1

consists of two steps:

• construct a real number set S which includes all the critical values of k, where k

is taken as an implicit function deﬁned by F = 0

• distinguish the greatest or least value of k from other members of S

In the present paper, the treatment method for the ﬁrst step is as same as that in
the author’s earlier articles [6, 7, 8], however, for the second step, the approach is taken
in a somewhat diﬀerent way - just use a MAPLE internal package without any external
software such as BOTTEMA.

1

Example 1. Find the greatest number k that satisﬁes

a3 + b3 + c3 + k (a2b + b2c + c2a) − (k + 1)(ab2 + bc2 + ca2) ≥ 0

(1)

for all nonnegative real numbers a, b, c.

By f denote a3 + b3 + c3 + k (a2b + b2c + c2a) − (k + 1)(ab2 + bc2 + ca2).
To conﬁrm the existance of such a greatest value, we need to prove that the feasible
set of k has an upper bound. There are several ways to be used, say, substituting 2, 3, 1
for a, b, c respectively, the inequality (1) becomes 11 − 2 k ≥ 0, hence k < 6. So, such a
greatest value actually exists since the feasible set is a closed one.

In order to convert the problem to an unconstrained optimization, we replace a, b, c

with x2, y2, z2 respectively, and denote the resulted polynomial by F ,

F := x6 + y6 + z6 + k (x4y2 + y4z2 + z4x2) − (k + 1)(x2y4 + y2z4 + z2x4).

According to the procedure stated above, ﬁrst construct a set including all the critical
values of k. To do this, we may employ an elimination algorithm, Successive Resultant
Projection, which is sketched as follows:

Given a polynomial ϕ in x1, x2, ··· , compute the resultant of ϕ and ∂ϕ

with respect
to x1, remove the multiple factors, and denote that by ϕ1; compute the resultant of ϕ1
and ∂ϕ1
with respect to x2, remove the multiple factors, and denote by ϕ2; ··· , repeat
∂x2
this procedure successively until the last resultant becomes a univariate polynomial.

∂x1

We may use the following self-compiled short program with Maple to remove multiple

factors:

> powerfree:= proc (poly, vset) local P, W, fs;

P:= 1; fs:= factors(poly)[2];
if nops(fs)= 1 then return fs[1][1] end if;
for W in op(map(L->L[1], fs)) do

if has(W, vset) = true then P:= P*W end if

end do;
P

end proc

This program is able to remove not only multiple factors but other useless or redundant
factors as well.

Let’s go back to Example 1.
At ﬁrst, when k is taken as an implicit function deﬁned by f (k, a, b, c) = 0, ﬁnd a set
including all the critical values of k by means of the Successive Resultant Projection,
with Maple.

> F:= x^6+y^6+z^6+k*(x^4*y^2+x^2*z^4+y^4*z^2)-(k+1)*(x^4*z^2+x^2*y^4+y^2*z^4)
> f1:= powerfree(resultant(F, diff(F, x), x), k)
> f2:= powerfree(resultant(f1, diff(f1, y), y), k)
Now we have

f2 = (k2+k+1)(k4+2 k3−

whereof each interval contains one and only one real root of f2.

So, k has at most 4 critical values because the real roots of f2 include all the critical
values of k, consequently, if the greatest value of k (denoted by kmax) exists, it must
belong to one of the 4 intervals above.

On the other hand, there may also be some intervals where none critical value of k

is in, because resultant computation can sometimes produce extra-factors.

So far the ﬁrst step of our procedure has been done.

2 Directly down to Real-Root-Classiﬁcation

Consider a semi-algebraic system:

Φ(k) = 0,
Ψ (k, x, y, z) ≥ 0,
k − α > 0, β − k > 0,




where α, β are constants.

We ask for a necessary and suﬃcient condition on parameters x, y, z such that the
equation Φ(k) = 0 has a speciﬁed number of roots satisfying all the inequalities above.

F = x6 + y6 + z 6 + k (x4y2 + y4z 2 + z 4x2) − (k + 1)(x2y4 + y2z 4 + z 2x4)
and ask for a necessary and suﬃcient condition on parameters x, y, z such that the
equation f2 = 0 has a unique real root satisfying all the inequalities in the following
system:

There has been a Maple function, RealRootClassiﬁcation, which is specially designed
to solve this kind of problems. To get the required condition, we ﬁrst start Maple and
load some relative internal packages as follows.

> with(RegularChains):
> with(ParametricSystemTools):
> with(SemiAlgebraicSetTools):

Then deﬁne an order of the variables:

> R:= PolynomialRing([k,x,y,z]):

and choose a more direct output

> infolevel[RegularChains]:= 1:

Input the relative polynomials:

> f2:= (k^2+k+1)*(k^4+2*k^3-107/7*k^2-114/7*k-89/7)*(k^4+2*k^3-5*k^2-6*k-23)

*(k^2+k+19/27)

> F:= x^6+y^6+z^6+k*(x^4*y^2+x^2*z^4+y^4*z^2)-(k+1)*(x^4*z^2+x^2*y^4+y^2*z^4)

Now, by calling

> RealRootClassification([f2],[F],[k-159/64,319/128-k],[ ],3,1..n,R)

the screen displays the following output:

There is always given number of real solution(s)!

64 , 319
That means, for any reals x, y, z, polynomial f2 always has some root in (cid:0) 159
128(cid:1)
which satisﬁes F ≥ 0. Such a root is unique because f2 has only one root in this
interval. By k1 denote this unique root, then

x6 + y6 + z6 + k1(x4y2 + y4z2 + z4x2) − (k1 + 1)(x2y4 + y2z4 + z2x4) ≥ 0

(5)

for all reals x, y, z. Hence,

a3 + b3 + c3 + k1(a2b + b2c + c2a) − (k1 + 1)(ab2 + bc2 + ca2) ≥ 0

(6)

for all nonnegative real numbers a, b, c.

On the other hand, by k0 denote the greatest value of k taken over (cid:2) 159
128(cid:3) that
satisfying F ≥ 0 for all x, y, z. Since k0 is a local maximum, so is a critical value of k,
hence a real root of f2.
However, f2 has only one root in (cid:2) 159
128(cid:3), so k0 = k1, that is, k1 is the local
maximum of k taken over (cid:2) 159

128(cid:3).

64 , 319

To compute k1, by calling

the screen displays the ﬂoating-point value of k1:

k1 = 2.484435332···

In this way, for any interval in list (3), say, (cid:2) 117

128(cid:3), we can decide if it contains a

By calling

> RealRootClassification([f2],[F],[k-117/32,469/128-k],[ ],3,1..n,R)

the screen displays the following output:

The system has given number of real solution(s) IF AND ONLY IF

[[R[1]<=0]

OR

· · · · · · · · · · · ·

That means, the root of f2 in (cid:2) 117
128(cid:3) does not satisfy F ≥ 0 when R1 > 0, R2 < 0,
i.e. it even cannot satisfy F ≥ 0 for some x, y, z, not to mention being a local maximum
of k we asked for.

32 , 469

Note that the intervals of list (3) are displayed automatically in increasing order, i.e.
the numbers in one interval are not greater than those in the next interval. Therefore, on
distinguishing which interval contains the global maximum of k, the ﬁrst two intervals

can be ignored, and on the other hand, the last interval, (cid:2) 117
excluded, so k1 is not only a local maximum but also the global maximum of k, the
greatest number which satisﬁes F ≥ 0 for all real numbers x, y, z.

128(cid:3), has already been

By establishing the corresponding relation between each interval of list (3) and the
real roots of polynomial f2, we know that k1 is the unique real root of k4 + 2 k3 − 5 k2 −

Next, we consider a analogous problem.

Example 2. Find the greatest number k that satisﬁes

2 (a3 + b3 + c3) + 3 k a b c − (k + 2)(a2b + b2c + c2a) ≥ 0

for all nonnegative real numbers a, b, c.

By f denote 2 (a3 + b3 + c3) + 3 k a b c − (k + 2)(a2b + b2c + c2a).
Observe that f is a decreasing function with respect to k, because

∂f
∂k

= 3 abc − (a2b + b2c + c2a) ≤ 0

by Arithmetic-mean-Geometric-mean inequality.

(7)

(8)

In order to convert the problem to an unconstrained optimization, we replace a, b, c

with x2, y2, z2 respectively, and denote the resulted polynomial by F ,

F := 2 (x6 + y6 + z6) + 3 k x2y2z2 − (k + 2)(x4y2 + y4z2 + z4x2).

Perform the ﬁrst step of the procedure as done previously, to construct a set including

all the critical values of k by means of the Successive Resultant Projection:

> F := 2*(x^6+y^6+z^6)+3*k*x^2*y^2*z^2-(k+2)*(x^4*y^2+y^4*z^2+z^4*x^2)
> f1:= powerfree(resultant(F, diff(F, x), x), k)
> f2:= powerfree(resultant(f1, diff(f1, y), y), k)
Now we have

,

where each interval contains one and only one real root of f2. Among the 12 intervals,
we need to decide which one contains the global maximum of k.

It was pointed out that f is a decreasing function with respect to k, so is F . This

fact allows us to use a more eﬃcient method.

Let [α, β] be an interval and α is not a critical value of k. We have the following

assertion:

Proposition 1. If F (α, x, y, z) ≥ 0 holds for all real numbers x, y, z, but F (β, x, y, z) ≥

0 does not hold for some reals x, y, z, then, the global maximum of k must belong to
[α, β].

This is almost obvious. By kmax denote the global maximum of k. That kmax > α
because kmax is “the greatest number” satisfying F ≥ 0 for all reals x, y, z, and kmax 6= α
for α is not a critical value of k. On the other hand, F is decreasing with respect to k,
since F (β, x, y, z) ≥ 0 does not hold for some reals x, y, z, not to mention any number
greater than β, so we have α < kmax < β.

Now, the problem of ﬁnding kmax has been converted to inequality proving.

For instance, to check if the interval (cid:2) 227

t, and make use of RealRootClassiﬁcation as follows.

32(cid:3) contains kmax, introduce a slack variable

128 , 57

> F:= 2*(x^6+y^6+z^6)+3*k*x^2*y^2*z^2-(k+2)*(x^4*y^2+y^4*z^2+z^4*x^2)

> g2:= subs(k=57/32, F)

> with(RegularChains):
> with(ParametricSystemTools):
> with(SemiAlgebraicSetTools):
> R:= PolynomialRing([t,x,y,z]):
> infolevel[RegularChains]:= 1:

and then, by calling

> RealRootClassification([g1+t],[ ],[t],[ ],3,0,R)

the screen displays the following output:

There is always given number of real solution(s)!

Let’s interpret what the meaning is. The ﬁrst argument of the input, g1 + t, means
given an equation g1 + t = 0, where t is a slack variable; the third argument, t,
means a requirement t > 0; the sixth argument, 0, means “none real root”. So,

6

the input means: regarding t as the unknown and x, y, z as parameters, to find a
sufficient and necessary condition under which the equation g1 + t = 0 has none
positive root.

The output, there is always given number of real solution(s), gives the an-
swer that the equation g1 + t = 0 has none positive root for any x, y, z, i.e. g1 ≥ 0 for
all reals x, y, z.

Let’s go on, by calling

> RealRootClassification([g2+t],[ ],[t],[ ],3,0,R)

the screen displays the following output:

The system has given number of real solution(s) IF AND ONLY IF

[0 < R[1]]

where

R[1] = 64*x^6-121*x^4*y^2+171*x^2*y^2*z^2-121*x^2*z^4+ · · · · · ·

That means, g2 + t = 0 has none positive root only if R1 > 0 but it will have a positive
root when R1 < 0, i.e. g2 ≥ 0 does not hold for some reals x, y, z.
interval (cid:2) 227

Therefore, according to Proposition 1, the global maximum kmax must belong to the

128 , 57
32(cid:3).

To compute kmax, by calling

> k[max] = fsolve(f2, k, 227/128..57/32)

the screen displays the ﬂoating-point value of k1:

kmax = 1.779763150···

By establishing the corresponding relation between each interval in list (9) and the
real roots of polynomial f2, we know that kmax is the unique real root of k3 + 6 k2 +
12 k − 46. Then,

kmax = 3 3√2 − 2 ≈ 1.779763150···

In Example 1 and Example 2, the best possible constant can be written in radicals,

but frequently cannot be in some other cases.

Remark. List (9) contains a “degenerate” interval [α, α] indicates that α is a
rational root of f2. Then, α is the global maximum of k if and only if F (α, x, y, z) ≥ 0
for all x, y, z and any number which is greater than α does not satisfy this constraint.
The same argument also applies to the list (3) in Example 1.

Example 3.[2] Find the greatest number k that satisﬁes

a2b4 − k ab3 +pa2 + b4 ab3 + b3 + a ≥ 0

(10)

for all nonnegative real numbers a, b.

By f denote a2b4 − k ab3 + √a2 + b4 ab3 + b3 + a.

Clearly f is a decreasing function with respect to k.

7

In order to convert the problem to an unconstrained optimization, we replace a, b, c

with x2, y2, z2 respectively, and denote the resulted polynomial by Φ,

Φ := x4y8 − k x2y6 +px4 + y8 x2y6 + y6 + x2.

To remove the radical, let h := x4 + y8 − u2 so that Φ can be replaced with the

rational polynomial,

F := x4y8 − k x2y6 + u x2y6 + y6 + x2.

(11)

Perform the ﬁrst step of the procedure as done previously, to construct a set including

all the critical values of k by means of the Successive Resultant Projection:

> F := x^4*y^8-k*x^2*y^6+u*x^2*y^6+y^6+x^2
> h := x^4+y^8-u^2
> f0:= powerfree(resultant(F, h, u), k)
> f1:= powerfree(resultant(f0, diff(f0, x), x), k)
> f2:= powerfree(resultant(f1, diff(f1, y), y), k)
The screen displays that f2 is the product of three factors which are of degrees 34, 32,

Let’s go on, by calling

the screen displays the following output:

That means, regarding u as the unknown, when R1 < 0 and R2 > 0, the equation h = 0
will have a positive root such that g2 < 0, i.e. g2 ≥ 0 does not hold for some reals x, y.
Therefore, according to Proposition 1, the global maximum kmax must belong to the
interval (cid:2) 69

16 , 553
128(cid:3).

To compute kmax, by calling

> k[max] = fsolve(f2, k, 69/16..533/128)

the screen displays the ﬂoating-point value of k1:

kmax = 4.315351626···

By establishing the corresponding relation between each interval in list (13) and the
real roots of polynomial f2, we know that kmax is the greatest real root of an irreducible
polynomial of degree 34.

The method used in this section does not apply to the Example 1, because the
Proposition 1 is invalid as the polynomial a3 + b3 + c3 + k (a2b+ b2c+ c2a)− (k + 1)(ab2 +
bc2 + ca2) is neither decreasing nor increasing with respect to k for all nonnegative
numbers a, b, c.

4 Conclusion

We demonstrated a symbolic method with Maple for ﬁnding the best possible value
of a parameter satisfying some constraints of inequalities and equalities. This method
does not employ the external packages.

A recent article [3] gave a proof of the correctness of successive resultant projection
and proposed a simpliﬁed projection operator of which the projection scale is smaller
so it is more eﬀective for many problems. However, the optimization method provided
in that article does not seem to solve some constrained problems such as the third
example in the present paper.

The equivalence between successive resultant projection and Brown-McCallum’s pro-

jection [1, 5, 4] was proven in [9].
