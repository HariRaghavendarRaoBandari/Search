Abstract

Preventing infectious disease like ﬂu from spreading to large communities is one of the most important issues for
humans. One eﬀective strategy is voluntary vaccination, however, there is always the temptation for people refusing
to be vaccinated because once herd immunity is achieved, infection risk is greatly reduced. In this paper, we study
the eﬀect of social impact on the vaccination behavior resulting in preventing infectious disease in networks. The
evolutionary simulation results show that the social impact has both positive and negative eﬀects on the vaccination
behavior. Especially, in heterogeneous networks, if the vaccination cost is low the behavior is more promoted than
the case without social impact. In contrast, if the cost is high, the behavior is reduced compared to the case without
social impact. Moreover, the vaccination behavior is eﬀective in heterogeneous networks more than in homogeneous
networks. This implies that the social impact puts people at risk in homogeneous networks.

1. Introduction

From the past to the present, infectious diseases have threatened humans all over the world [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. One
of the eﬀective ways to prevent diseases is voluntary (preemptive) vaccination. However, the behavior has a social
dilemma structure. Basically, people can prevent diseases by getting vaccinated but hesitate to do so because they
will bear the cost. Nevertheless, if people do not get vaccinated, they may be infected, which is worse than paying
the vaccination cost. Here, once “herd immunity” [6] is achieved in communities, not getting vaccinated is more
attractive to people because the risk to be infected is greatly reduced in such a situation. Thus, people want other
people to get vaccinated but do not want to be vaccinated themselves. People want a free ride on other people’s
cooperative behavior. Because of this dilemma, it is diﬃcult to spread the voluntary vaccination.

Many studies have been done to investigate situations which promote voluntary vaccination. First, game theoretic
models with epidemic dynamics have been used to explain the individual vaccination in well-mixed populations [7, 8,
9, 10], random networks [11, 12], or scale-free networks [13]. The game theoretic analysis commonly assumes that
the strategy for vaccination is static. However, in reality, it can be changed over time as the epidemic spreads. Then,
evolutionary game theoretic models combined with epidemiological dynamics classiﬁed as “evolutionary vaccination
games” have been developed [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Since real human interactions can be described by networked
populations, some studies focused on evolutionary vaccination games using heterogeneous networks [19, 20, 21, 22].
Fu et al. and Cardillo et al. revealed that vaccination is eﬀective despite the high cost in heterogeneous networks
compared to homogeneous networks, because once hub nodes are vaccinated, the behavior immediately spreads to
the whole population [19, 20]. Cardillo et al. , however, have shown that if the vaccine is imperfect, homogeneous
networks conversely outperform heterogeneous networks [20]. Recently, Han and Sun considered a dynamic model
of the evolutionary vaccination game in which the relationship among individuals is dynamically changed over time
[23].

In those networked models, when imitation of the strategy is conducted, only the payoﬀ information of one partic-
ular neighbor is obvious. If people use broader information, what happens to the dynamics? Based on this motivation,
several studies used various types of information such as, social status information [24], memory [25], memory and
conformism [26], and other-regarding tendencies [27]. Fukuda et al. investigated the eﬀect of social status information

Figure 1: Our model consists of two stages: decision-making and epidemic spreading. In the decision-making stage, each individual makes a
decision whether to get vaccinated or not. If an individual chooses to get vaccinated, his payoﬀ is −C because of the vaccine cost but results in
the perfect immunity against the ﬂu-like disease. After that, the epidemic spreading takes place according to SIR dynamics. If an individual gets
infected, his payoﬀ is −1. If an individual can avoid the disease, his payoﬀ is 0 because he does not need to pay any cost. The vaccinated individuals
never get infected. Since we suppose a seasonal inﬂuenza-like disease, it disappears at the end of the season. At the beginning of the next season,
individuals have to make a decision again based on the last year’s outcome, and then the next epidemic starts. These two stages are repeated every
year.

in which each individual can use the information of the average payoﬀ of its neighbors instead of the payoﬀ of one
randomly selected neighbor [24]. They showed that the eﬀectiveness of the social status depends on both network
structures and the cost of vaccination. In a similar study, Zhang incorporated the eﬀect of the neighbors’ payoﬀs,
called “other-regarding tendency”, and showed that the tendency inﬂuences the vaccination coverage diﬀerently de-
pending on the vaccination cost [27]. Moreover, Han and Sun considered the situation that hub players can greatly
inﬂuence others on networks [26]. They showed that not following such hubs contributes to the large vaccination
coverage.

Those studies use the payoﬀ of others as the broader information. In reality, people sometimes follow their neigh-
bors’ decisions irrespective of the payoﬀ. In other words, people may compare the number of vaccinated neighbors
with non-vaccinated neighbors and then imitate the majority of them. In this paper, we propose a new model in which
the eﬀect of such “social impact” [28] is incorporated on networks. Our computer simulation results show that, in
heterogeneous networks, when the cost of vaccination is low, inﬂuential social impact increases the vaccination cover-
age. On the other hand, the impact reduces the coverage if the cost is high. Moreover, since the vaccination coverage
of homogeneous networks is lower than that of heterogeneous networks as we will show, following the social impact
in homogeneous networks may pose a great threat to society.

2. Model

We developed a model in which an epidemic spreading and individual decision-making take place alternately.
Before the epidemic spreads, individuals make a decision whether to get vaccinated or not based on their vaccination
strategy. The decision is aﬀected by both the payoﬀ of others and the social impact, which is controlled by the
parameter α. Then, epidemic spreading takes place based on the standard susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR)
model. Here, we assume seasonal inﬂuenza as the target disease. To realize them, we consider two stages: decision-
making stage and epidemic spreading stage (Fig. 1). The detail of each dynamic is the following.

2

2.1. Decision-making stage

Each individual makes a decision whether to take vaccination or not. We assume that the vaccine gives the perfect
immunity to vaccinated individuals. Once an individual decides to get vaccinated, his payoﬀ is −C as the vaccination
cost (0 ≤ C ≤ 1). The cost may include the monetary cost and the side eﬀects. When an individual chooses not to get
vaccinated, there are two situations. If the individual is infected, the payoﬀ is −1 because getting infected is the worst
case. In contrast, if the individual is not infected, the payoﬀ is 0 as the ideal case. We also calculate the payoﬀs of the
neighbors of individual i in the same way.

With the weight 1 − α, the focal individual i compares his payoﬀ with one randomly selected neighbor, j’s payoﬀ,
and then updates his strategy (payoﬀ-based strategy updating). With the weight α, the focal individual i ignores his
payoﬀ and neighbors’ payoﬀs and counts his neighbors’ strategies, and then updates his strategy (popularity-based
strategy updating). Based on these conditions, the probability P(si ← s j) that the individual i with the strategy si
imitates j’s strategy s j is given by a pairwise comparison according to the Fermi function [29, 30].

where κ is a measure of noise and controls the strength of selection (0 < κ < ∞). For κ → 0, individuals are
sensitive to the diﬀerence of payoﬀ and popularity. In this paper, we ﬁxed the value of κ to be κ = 0.1 to be the same
as the typical studies [26, 24]. α controls the intensity between the payoﬀ factor and the popularity factor (0 ≤ α ≤ 1).
Nvac(i) (Nnon(i)) is the number of the vaccinated (non-vaccinated) neighbors of i.

2.2. Epidemic spreading stage

After the individuals have been or not have not been vaccinated by the above decision-process, the epidemic
spreading stage takes place. The dynamics are described by the standard SIR model in which the population is di-
vided into three types: Susceptible (S ), Infectious (I), and Recovered (R) individuals. First, the disease is triggered
by randomly selected infectious individuals I0. After the disease breaks out, each non-vaccinated individual i gets
infected with the probability 1 − (1 − β)Nin f (i) where Nin f (i) is the number of infected neighbors and β is the transmission
rate per day. β is diﬀerent depending on the network topology as described in the next subsection. There is no risk of
infection for the vaccinated individuals because the vaccination provides perfect immunity. Once each individual is
infected, he recovers from the infection with rate γ per day. We set γ = 1/3 day−1. Since it is diﬃcult to mathemati-
cally describe the dynamics of structured populations, we numerically simulate the epidemic dynamics by using the
Gillespie algorithm [31, 19]. The values of β and γ are determined by assuming the ﬂu-like disease.

2.3. Network structure

The above two stages of dynamics are conducted on networks. Here, each individual is represented as a node
and each edge means that there is an interaction between two individuals. In this paper, along the same lines as the
previous study [24], we consider three typical networks: a square lattice, a random regular graph (RRG) [32], and
the Barab´asi-Albert scale-free (BA) network [33]. Without vaccination, the same β yields the diﬀerent ﬁnal epidemic
size [19]. Thus, with 0.9 as the same ﬁnal epidemic size for the baseline [24], we select the diﬀerent transmission
rate for each network: β = 0.46 day−1 person−1 for the square lattice, β = 0.37 day−1 person−1 for the RRG, and
β = 0.55 day−1 person−1 for the BA network.

3. Results and discussions

We conducted simulation experiments using the individual-based model. The parameter setting used for the
experiments is as follows unless noted otherwise: population size N = 1600, average degree k = 4, recovery rate
γ = 1/3 day−1, transmission rate β is diﬀerent depending on each network, seeds of disease spreading I0 = 5. The
population size is enough to be evaluated because it is consistent with the results of larger populations [24]. In the
ﬁrst iteration, equal fractions of the vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals are randomly located in each network,
then the epidemic starts. From the second iteration, individuals decide their strategy based on the algorithm of the
decision-making stage followed by the spread of the epidemic. The iterations ﬁnish at 1000. The last 100 iterations
are averaged and used as the equilibrium results in all ﬁgures.

3.1. Eﬀect of social impact on voluntary vaccination

We systematically varied values of α to know the eﬀect on the vaccination coverage and the ﬁnal epidemic size
in the diﬀerent networks. Figure 2 shows vaccination coverage and the ﬁnal epidemic size as the functions of the
vaccination cost and the value of α. First, we focus on α = 0, which means that individuals care only about the payoﬀ
diﬀerence with one randomly selected neighbor and do not pay attention to the popularity of the neighbors. In this
case, the BA network most enhanced the vaccination behavior; the RRG was the second; the square lattice was the
last. The results are consistent with the previous ones [19, 24]. If there is no vaccine, infectious diseases easily spread
to the population in the BA network and the RRG compared to the square lattice. This is because the heterogeneity in
the BA network or the randomness in the RRG makes the average path length of the network shorter. This conversely
promotes vaccination coverage since, in this situation, herd immunity is diﬃcult to achieve and then there is less
incentive to free-ride by not getting vaccinated. Therefore, these two networks enhance voluntary vaccination.

Then, we focus on how the social impact factor α aﬀects voluntary vaccination. In the square lattice and the RRG
populations, the vaccination behavior is greatly suppressed (Fig. 2). Basically, for these networks, the vaccination
coverage is less than 0.5 at α = 0, which means that getting vaccinated is not popular. This behavior is negatively
facilitated by the social impact and the behavior is promoted further as α becomes larger. Thus, we can conclude that
the social impact is harmful for both networks. We shift to the result of the BA network. In this case, the social impact
has both positive and negative eﬀects on voluntary vaccination. If the vaccination cost is low (Cr < 0.4), the social
impact positively facilitates voluntary vaccination because the behavior is already common (> 0.5) even without the
factor α = 0. Conversely, the social impact has the reverse eﬀect when the vaccination cost is high (Cr > 0.5). The
behavior is suppressed similar to the square lattice and the RRG cases.

Note that in the BA network, if α is too high, the lower α facilitates a positive or negative eﬀect moreso than the
higher value (see the entire α dynamics in Fig. 3). For example, comparing α = 0.9 (the lower) with α = 0.95 (the
higher), the former case easily facilitates both positive and negative eﬀects. In the case of α = 1.0, the vaccination cost
has no meaning any more. This leads to random ﬂuctuation and causes almost 0.5 vaccination coverage on average.
Thus, if α is too high, the payoﬀ-based optimization does not work well. In other words, there is an optimal point of
the value of α for the vaccination behavior depending on the balance between the payoﬀ-based and popularity-based
imitation behaviors.

3.2. Eﬀect of initial vaccinated individuals

So far, we described that the social impact has positive and negative eﬀects for facilitating voluntary vaccination.
We reasoned that the cases obtained depend on the existing popularity of the population. To verify this, the initial
fraction of the vaccinated individuals is changed in the BA network; most individuals are vaccinated is 0.9 whereas
individuals are vaccinated is 0.1. Figure 4 shows the vaccination coverage in those cases. When α = 0.1, the initial
fraction of the vaccinated individuals has little eﬀect on the ﬁnal vaccination coverage. This is because the individuals
mostly care about the payoﬀ diﬀerence with others and results in the optimal coverage threshold based on the payoﬀ.
In contrast, the initial fraction heavily aﬀects the ﬁnal vaccination coverage in the case of high α (α = 0.9). In this
case, because the initial fraction is larger than 0.5, vaccinated individuals are already the majority. Then, even if the
voluntary vaccination is unfavorable from the viewpoint of the payoﬀ, the behavior is positively facilitated by the
social impact due to the initial advantage. Through this experiment, we found that the social impact certainly has the
facilitating eﬀect both in positive and negative ways.

4. Conclusions

In this paper, we investigated the eﬀect of social impact on voluntary vaccination and the ﬁnal epidemic size in
a network population model. We found that pursuing popular behavior has both positive and negative eﬀects on the
amount of the vaccination. When the vaccination behavior is the majority in the population, the behavior is promoted
further by the social impact. The reverse result is obtained when the vaccination is minor in the population. This fact
is experimentally conﬁrmed by modifying the initial fraction of the vaccinated individuals.

We also found that the eﬀect of the social impact greatly depends on the network structures. Basically, the square
lattice and the RRG do not promote the vaccination behavior even if the social impact is absent. Thus, in these
networks, the social impact negatively aﬀected the vaccination behavior. Conversely, in the BA network, the social

hundred independent simulation runs are averaged and the data interval is 0.05. The results of α = 0 correspond to the previous studies [19, 24].
In the square lattice and the RRG, the social impact negatively facilitates the vaccination coverage and the ﬁnal epidemic size. In contrast, the
BA network both positively and negatively facilitate them. This is because the majority at the speciﬁc vaccination cost is inﬂuenced by the social
impact. The entire α dynamics are shown in Fig. 3. Social impacts α = 0.0, 0.50, 0.90, 0.95 are shown. Transmission rate: for each network:
β = 0.46 day−1 person−1 for the square lattice, β = 0.37 day−1 person−1 for the RRG, and β = 0.55 day−1 person−1 for the BA network.

interval is 0.05. If α is the highest (α = 1.0), individuals do not care getting infected and the vaccination cost, resulting in random ﬂuctuation of
the vaccination coverage. Consequently, the coverage reaches 0.5 on average after 30 independent simulations.

impact positively facilitates the vaccination behavior as long as the vaccination cost is low. Similar results have also
been obtained in the previous study in which individuals make a decision whether to get vaccinated or not from both
payoﬀ-based and popularity-based factors probabilistically [34]. The critical diﬀerence between our model and their
model is the following two points. First, we considered how the strategy for the vaccination behavior changes over
time based on evolutionary games. Secondly, we used various network structures to investigate the spread of the
vaccination behavior and found that the results are quite diﬀerent depending on the structures. These two situations
are not considered in the previous study [34].

From the viewpoint of a society level, what we showed is that societies should take into account the network
structures of the population when they make policies for vaccination. When societies are composed of homogeneous
interactions, people should be careful not to be aﬀected by others because following the majority may put people at
risk in such a situation. Also, the prevalence of the social impact becomes large when people can easily get information
on popular behavior. Therefore, societies may need to control the information available to the public depending on
the situation.
