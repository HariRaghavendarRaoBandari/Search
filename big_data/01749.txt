Here we report on the translocation of folded polymers through nano-pores using molecular dy-
namic simulations. Two cases are studied; one in which a folded molecule unfolds upon passage and
one in which the folding remains intact as the molecule passes through the nano-pore. The topology
of a folded polymer chain is deﬁned as the arrangement of the intramolecular contacts, known as
circuit topology. In the case where intramolecular contacts remain intact, we show that the dynam-
ics of passage through a nano-pore varies for molecules with diﬀering topologies: a phenomenon
that can be exploited to enrich certain topologies in mixtures. We ﬁnd that the nano-pore allows
reading of topology for short chains. Moreover, when the passage is coupled with unfolding, the
nano-pore enables discrimination between pure states, i.e., states for which the majority of contacts
are arranged identically. In this case, as we show here, it is also possible to read the positions of
the contact sites along a chain. Our results demonstrate the applicability of nano-pore technology
to characterize and sort molecules based on their topology.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Most biopolymers, such as RNAs [1], proteins [2, 3]
and genomic DNA [4], are found in folded conﬁgurations.
Folding involves the formation of one or more intramolec-
ular interactions, termed contacts. Proper folding of
these molecules is often necessary for their function. In-
tensive eﬀorts have been made to measure the geomet-
ric and topological properties of protein and RNA folds,
and to ﬁnd generic relations between those properties and
molecular function, dynamics and evolution [1–4]. Like-
wise, topological properties of synthetic molecules have
been subject to intense research, and their signiﬁcance
for polymer chemistry [5, 6] and physics [7–9] has been
widely recognized.

Topology is a mathematical term, which is used to de-
scribe the properties of objects that remain unchanged
under continuous deformation [10]. Diﬀerent approaches
have been discussed in the literature to describe the
topology of branched [11] or knotted polymers [12]. How-
ever, many important biopolymers, such as proteins and
nucleic acids, are unknotted linear chains. The circuit
topology approach has recently been introduced to char-
acterize the folded conﬁguration of linear polymers. Cir-
cuit topology of a linear chain elucidates generically the
arrangement of intra-chain contacts of a folded-chain con-
ﬁguration [13] (see Fig. 1). The arrangement of the con-
tacts has been shown to be a determinant of the folding
rates and unfolding pathways of biomolecules, [14] and
has important implications for bimolecular evolution and
molecular engineering [15, 16].

Topology characterization and sorting of polymers has
been the subject of intense research in recent years; bulk

puriﬁcation of theta-shaped and three-armed star poly-
mers is performed using chromatography [17, 18]; linear
and circular DNA are separated in nano-grooves embed-
ded in a nano-slit [19]; and star-branched polymers with
diﬀerent number of arms are shown to travel with diﬀer-
ent speeds through a nano-channel [20]. In the context of
characterization, linear and circular DNA molecules are
probed by conﬁning them in a nano-channel and using
ﬂuorescence microscopy [21]. We know little about how
to sort folded linear polymers based on topology. This is
in contrast to size sorting of folded linear polymers which
has been studied extensively in the literature [22–24].

Nano-pore technology represents a versatile tool for
single-molecule studies and biosensing. A typical setting
involves a voltage diﬀerence across the nano-pore in an
ionic solution containing the desired molecule. The ion
current through the nano-pore decreases as the molecule
enters the pore. The level of current reduction and its
duration reveals information about the molecule [25, 26].
Prior to the current project, diﬀerent properties of nucleic
acids and proteins have been studied using nano-pore
technology, for example: DNA sequencing [27, 28], unzip-
ping of nucleic acids [29, 30], protein detection [31, 32],
unfolding of proteins [33–35], and interactions between
nucleic acids and proteins [36, 37].

In our study, we used simple models of polymer chains
and molecular dynamic simulations to determine how the
circuit topology of a chain inﬂuences its passage through
a nano-pore. We investigated whether nano-pores can be
used for topology-based sorting and characterization of
folded chains. Two scenarios were considered: (1) pas-
sage through pores large enough to permit the chain to
pass through without breaking its contacts, and (2) pas-
sage of chains through small nano-pores, during which
contacts were ripped apart. In the ﬁrst scenario, nano-
pore technology enabled puriﬁcation of chains with cer-
tain topologies and allowed us to read the topology of a

folded molecule as it passed through the pore. In the sec-
ond scenario, we used the nano-pore to read the circuit
topology of a single fold. We also asked if translocation
time and chain topology are correlated. This technology
has been subject to intense research for simple-structured
polynucleotides [38]; however, the current study is the
ﬁrst to use nano-pores to systematically measure contact
arrangements of folded molecules [13] (Fig. 1).

All simulations were performed by ESPResSo [39] as
detailed below. Initially, the ﬁrst monomer is ﬁxed in-
side the nano-pore. After the whole polymer is equi-
librated, the ﬁrst monomer is unﬁxed and force, F , is
applied to pull it through the nano-pore. For pore diam-
eters smaller than two monomers, passage of the polymer
inevitably leads to breakage of the contacts. In this case,
the bond between the contact sites is replaced with a sim-

Number of passed monomers and position of the ﬁrst
monomer versus time are studied in simulations. These
quantities are averaged over diﬀerent realizations. For
longer passages, the averages are again window-averaged
over intervals equal to 10 time units. Window-averaging
is used to reduce the data points and the noise in the
plots. To minimize the eﬀect of determinants other than
topology, we take equal spacing, l, between the contact
sites (connected monomers) and two tails on the sides
equal to the spacings. The total length of the polymer is
5l + 4. If the monomers are numbered consecutively from
one end, then, the position of the contact sites along the
chain would be l + 1, 2l + 2, 3l + 3 and 4l + 4. The spacing
is taken equal to 12 monomers, unless otherwise stated.
Some chains become knotted when the bonds are formed
in the chain or when the chain is pulled suddenly with
a strong force. Passage times of these knotted chains
are extremely long. The data related to these unusual
passages is removed before averaging.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Passage of folded chains

Consider translocation of 2-contact chains through a
nano-pore with an internal diameter equal to 3b. First we
assume contacts are permanent and unbreakable. Two
diﬀerent strengths for the pulling force, F = 6 kB T
and
b
10 kBT
, are examined. 50 realizations are performed for
b
each of the three topologies (Fig. 1(a)) and the two
forces. The average number of monomers passed through
the nano-pore versus time is shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b).
Shoulders in the curves correspond to pauses during the
passage of the polymer when the contacts encounter the
nano-pore. We ﬁrst examine the passage dynamics under
stronger force, F = 10 kBT
(Fig. 2(a)). One shoulder is
b
observed during the passages of the cross and the parallel
topologies, while the series topology is markedly diﬀerent
with two clear shoulders during its passage. The average
number of passed monomers at the shoulders coincides
with the position of the contact sites (shown with hor-
izontal lines in the plot). This conﬁrms interpretation
of the shoulders as the pauses related to the passage of
the contacts. The average number of monomers inside
the nano-pore versus time is also signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
for the series topology (inset of Fig. 2(a)). Two distinct
peaks are observed for the series topology, while only
one peak is seen for the cross and the parallel topologies.
The peaks in the inset plot occur simultaneously with the
shoulders in the main plot.

Force has a dramatic eﬀect on the passage dynam-
ics of chains. Fig. 2(b) plots the average number of
monomers passed through the nano-pore versus time un-
der F = 6 kB T
. Here, the maximum passage time for the
b
chain with parallel topology is larger relative to other
topologies, while the one with the series topology had
the largest maximum passage time under the stronger
force. By reducing the force, the passage time gets much
longer and the entropic eﬀects become dominant. As a
result, the shoulders in the number of passed monomers
are not as clear as before. One shoulder is observed for all
topologies at the position of the ﬁrst contact site. Two
other shoulders are observed during the passage of the
chain with parallel contact arrangemenet. The second
shoulder corresponds to the time when the large loop of
the chain is midway inside the nano-pore. Furthermore,
the third shoulder is due to the second contact and the
pause caused by the entropy of the second small loop in
the parallel topology (shown schematically in the inset).
Additionally, two peaks are seen in the time proﬁle of
the average number of monomers inside the nano-pore.
These peaks appear simultaneously with the described
shoulders in the time proﬁle of the number of passed
monomers (inset of Fig. 2(b)). We note that the ﬁrst
and the third shoulders are also seen in the average po-
sition of the ﬁrst monomer versus time (Fig. S2).

The results show that it is possible to distinguish the
series and parallel from other topologies using nano-pores

with strong and weak forces, respectively. The number
of passed monomers and the number of monomers inside
the nano-pore can be readily measured in experiments.
The former can be measured by pulling the end of the
polymer using optical tweezers [26], while the latter is
readable by measuring the ion current through the nano-
pore. The ion current has been shown to take discrete
values with the number of monomers in the nano-pore
[40]. Finally, the maximum passage time in each pulling
force is also diﬀerent for the three topologies and can
be used alternatively for identifying the topology of a 2-
contact unbreakable chain. To generalize the obtained
results to molecules of various sizes (chain lengths), we
investigate the passage of a chain with two unbreakable
contacts and double spacing between the contact sites
under weak and strong pulling forces. Position of the
shoulders and the peaks are in agreement with the above
descriptions (Fig. S3). Also, it is seen that the maximum
passage time is longer for the series topology under the
strong force and for the parallel topology under the weak
force. (see ESI section 1)

Next, we consider folded molecules with more than two
intramolecular contacts. Nano-pores of various sizes are
needed to pass these complex unbreakable topologies un-
der usual pulling forces. This gives the opportunity to
use the nano-pore for purifying topologies or for enrich-
ment of a certain topology from a mixture of diﬀerent
topologies. To test this idea, we examine the passage of
3-contact chains through a pore with an internal diameter
equal to 3b under the pulling force F = 10 kBT
. There are
b
15 topologically diﬀerent conﬁgurations for a 3-contact
chain. Among these, three conﬁgurations have two par-
allel relations in their topologies, shown in Fig 1(b). Two
of them (among all 15 conﬁgurations) do not pass the
nano-pore in usual time intervals. This is in agreement

with the expectation that chains with a higher number
of parallel topologies tend to interlock more, and do not
pass through smaller pores. The three chains shown in
Fig. 1(b) behave similarly when they enter the nano-pore
from either end. This means that the chain direction is
not important in purifying the topologies using a nano-
pore.

We then extended the simulations to 5-contact chains
as a representation of real chains with increasing com-
plexities. There are (2*5-1)!!=1500 topologically diﬀer-
ent conﬁgurations for a 5-contact chain, so we chose con-
ﬁgurations at random and passed them through the nano-
pore under the pulling force F = 10 kBT
. The chains are
b
examined to see whether they pass through the nano-
pore in a reasonable time. A ﬁrst-order measure of the
circuit topology of a chain is the number of contact pairs
that are in series, cross, or parallel arrangements. Fig.
3 shows the average numbers of the three topological
arrangements versus the internal diameter of the nano-
pore, d, for chains that pass and do not pass through
the nano-pore. The average number of series topology is
higher in the passed chains compared to the chains that
do not pass. The average number of parallel topology is
smaller in the passed chains, for pore diameters smaller
than four times the monomer size. Average number of
cross topology is smaller for passed chains. In a realistic
setting, when a mixture of randomly connected chains
are allowed to pass through a nano-pore (smaller than
4b), we predict that the ﬂow through would be enriched
in series topology. However, the fraction of the mixture
that fails to pass through the pore would contain chains
with high number of parallel and cross topologies.

This can be justiﬁed by the fact that in parallel and
cross topologies, the contact sites are relatively far from
each other along the chain. Thus, chains with a high

B. Passage coupled to chain unfolding

There are two parameters that determine the time
needed for the passage of a chain coupled to bond
breakup; the bond strength and the pulling force. We
ﬁrst studied pulling of 2-contact chains through a nano-
pore with internal diameter equal to 1.4b, under a force
comparable to the bond strength (see ESI section 2 for
a theoretical description). For very weak bonds, with a
bond strength equal to 5kB T , the contacts break before
reaching the pore. This is due to the tension propagated
along the chain from the pulled end [41]. For medium
to strong bonds between 10 − 40kBT , it is possible to
see shoulders in the time proﬁle of the position of the
ﬁrst monomer, using suitable pulling forces (Figs. 4(a)
and 4(b)). For shoulders to become prominent, a large
pulling force is required to dominate the entropic ﬂuctua-
tions. However, it should not be too strong to completely
eliminate the eﬀect of topology. As the leading end of the
chain is stretched completely with large pulling forces,
the shoulders can be used to ﬁnd position of the contact
sites along the chain (horizontal lines in Figs. 4(a) and
4(b)).

FIG. 2. Average number of monomers passed through the
nano-pore versus time for a chain with two unbreakable con-
tacts. The pulling forces are equal to (a) F = 10 kB T
and (b)
b
F = 6 kB T
. The shoulders correspond to pauses in the pas-
b
sage process and can be used to read the chain topology. The
series topology shows two shoulders under the strong force
(a) and the parallel topology shows three shoulders under the
weak force (b). Insets: Average number of monomers inside
the nano-pore versus time. The peaks in the inset plots oc-
cur at the same time with the shoulders in the main plots.
Schematics shows the parallel topology and the arrow points
to the smaller loop. Entropy of the smaller loop causes the
last pause in the passage of the parallel topology under the
weak force.

number of contacts with parallel and cross arrangements
are bulkier and have more interlocking conﬁgurations. In
contrast, in series topology, the contacts are local and do
not connect distant points along the chain. As a result,
the chains with a high number of contacts with series
arrangements are more extended in conﬁguration and can
pass through the nano-pore more easily. As it is evident
from our study, the excluded volume interaction is the
main deriving force behind separation in a narrow nano-
pore; this interaction has not been considered in previous
theoretical works [17, 18].

Finally, simulations with a four times stronger pulling

sites. Position of the shoulders can give information about

sage times of the three topologies. The diﬀerence in-
creases by decreasing the pulling force. For very weak
forces, however, the entropic eﬀects become signiﬁcant
and hide the eﬀect of topology on the translocation time.
Moreover, the simulation time becomes very large and
simulations (experiments) are not cost-eﬀective. The re-
sults indicate that moderately weak forces can be used to
discriminate the three topologies. For this purpose, we
calculate the average passage times of the three topolo-
gies using a suitable pulling force (considering the bond
strength). Then, the maximum and the minimum av-
erage passage time is found among the three topolo-
gies. Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) show the topologies that have
the minimum and the maximum of the average passage
times, respectively. We note that changing the dataset
used for averaging does not alter the order of the av-
erage passage times of the three topologies for all bond

strengths and the corresponding suitable forces (Fig. S7
and Table S1). Therefore, the average translocation time
can be regarded as a tool for reading the chain topology.
(See ESI section 3)

To generalize our ﬁndings, we investigate translocation
of 5-contact chains to ﬁnd a correlation between topol-
ogy of the chain and its average passage time. In three
sets of simulations, one of the cross, parallel, and series
relations is taken to be dominant in the topology of the
chain, meaning that the majority of the contact pairs
have the dominant arrangement. We call such states as
”pure states”. More speciﬁcally, 8 out of 10 total binary
relations are taken the same; however, the numbers of the
other two relations are not determined. The average pas-
sage time in each set is calculated over 150 randomly cho-
sen chains that fulﬁll the mentioned conditions; Nc = 8,
Np = 8 or Ns = 8. For each bond energy and pulling
force, we also calculate the average passage time for a
fourth set which contains 150 completely random chains.
Again, we calculate the average passage times for the
three pure states. Then, the maximum and the minimum
passage times are found between the three sets. Pure
states that have the maximum and the minimum of the
average passage times are shown in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d).
Extremely large passage times, which occur due to chain
knotting, are removed from the data prior to averaging.
The order of the average passage time among pure states

does not depend on the data set used, while the data set
contains enough data points (Table S2). This shows that
the dominant topology in pure states can be recognized
by using the passage time through a nano-pore. (See ESI
section 4)

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we studied translocation of folded poly-
mers through nano-pores using molecular dynamics sim-
ulations. We found settings that are required for a nano-
pore setup to be able to read and sort molecules based
on their molecular topology. We showed that nano-pores
can be used to eﬃciently enrich certain topologies from
mixtures of random 5-contact chains and that this puriﬁ-

6

cation is not sensitive to chain orientation in the nano-
pore. We also showed that nano-pores can be used to
determine the chain topology for 2-contact chains when
the intact folded chains pass through the pore. When
the chain unfolds upon passing through the nano-pore,
we showed that the nano-pore enables determining the
position of the contacts along a 2-contact chain in large
pulling forces.
In this condition, by using moderate
forces, we could discriminate between pure states (i.e.,
states for which the majority of contacts were arranged
identically) by using the average passage time.
