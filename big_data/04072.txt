We report perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in the half-metallic ferromagnetic Heusler alloy
Co2Fe0.4Mn0.6Si (CFMS) in a MgO/CFMS/Pd trilayer stack. PMA is found for CFMS thicknesses be-
tween 1 and 2 nm, with a magnetic anisotropy energy density of KU = 1.5× 106 erg/cm3 for tCFMS = 1.5 nm.
Both the MgO and Pd layer are necessary to induce the PMA. We measure a tunable anomalous Hall eﬀect,
where its sign and magnitude vary with both the CFMS and Pd thickness.

A magnetic thin ﬁlm will generally prefer to have its
magnetic moment lying in the plane of the sample owing
to the large demagnetizing ﬁeld. New magnetic devices
have made it desirable to fabricate thin magnetic lay-
ers which instead have an easy axis of magnetization di-
rected perpendicular to the ﬁlm plane, a condition known
as perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA).1 In par-
ticular, spin-transfer-torque (STT) based devices require
that a magnetic free layer can be easily ﬂipped by a
spin-polarized current while maintaining a high stabil-
ity against thermal ﬂuctuations.2 Magnetic layers with
PMA are well suited to optimize this trade-oﬀ for device
applications.

In order to realize a high eﬃciency STT device, a
high degree of spin-polarization in the magnetic layers
is also desirable. CoFeB, with approximately 65% spin
polarization, has been the most widely studied mate-
rial so far, because it can be grown with PMA and in-
corporated into device structures with very large tun-
neling magnetoresistance (TMR).3 There is a strong
motivation to incorporate a half-metallic ferromagnet
(HMFM) with higher spin polarization in these devices,
and Heusler alloys are promising in this regard.4 In
particular, Co2FeSi and Co2MnSi both have 100% spin
polarization5–7 and high Curie temperatures (c. 1000◦C).
Recent studies have shown the intermediary compound
Co2FexMn(1−x)Si with x≈0.4 to be eminently promis-
ing for device applications with a low Gilbert damp-
ing parameter8 and record 75% room temperature GMR
ratio.9

Eﬀorts to induce PMA in the Heuslers have focused on
compounds containing Fe on MgO (eg. Co2FeAl10,11).
This was guided by earlier studies of CoFeB/MgO where
the PMA is thought to have its origin in the Fe-
O hybridization.3 PMA has recently been reported in
Co2MnSi in CMS/Pd multilayer stacks on MgO,12 and
for Pd buﬀered Co2FexMn1−xSi on MgO,13 but the de-
tails of the PMA and the contribution of the various in-
terfaces remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate PMA in
MgO/CFMS/Pd stacks, and show that both interfaces
are important for this eﬀect.

Samples were grown by DC magnetron sputtering in a
Kurt J Lesker CMS-18 UHV system with a base pres-

sure of 2 × 10−8 Torr. Multilayer stacks consisting

of MgO(2)/CFMS(tCFMS)/Pd(2.5), where the number in
parentheses is the nominal layer thickness in nm, were
grown on 10 × 10mm Si/SiO2 substrates at room tem-
perature and post-growth annealed in-situ for 1 hour at
300◦C with an in-plane magnetic ﬁeld of 170 Oe. MgO
was RF sputtered with 100 W power in 3 mTorr Ar, giv-
ing a growth rate of 0.05 ˚A/s. CFMS was DC sputtered
at 100 W and 5 mTorr Ar, giving a growth rate of 0.43
˚A/s, and Pd was DC sputtered at 175 W in 8 mTorr Ar,
with a growth rate of 4.0 ˚A/s. Growth rates were calcu-
lated by growing a thick (> 50 nm) ﬁlm and measuring
the thickness with a Dektak proﬁlometer. The composi-
tion of the Co2Fe0.4Mn0.6Si target was veriﬁed by energy
dispersive x-ray analysis in a SEM. Magnetization and
Hall resistance measurements were done in a Quantum
Design SQUID and PPMS respectively, at room temper-
ature. The Hall measurements were made using sam-
pleholders from Wimbush Science & Technology, with
spring-loaded contacts in a van der Pauw geometry.

In Figs. 1(a)-(d), magnetization measurements with
the ﬁeld applied parallel to the ﬁlm plane and perpen-
dicular to the ﬁlm plane demonstrate PMA for CFMS
ﬁlms with thicknesses between 1 & 2 nm. Samples in
this thickness range are easily magnetized out-of-plane,
having a small saturation ﬁeld (Hs < 100 Oe), and high
remanence [Fig. 1(e)]. With the ﬁeld applied in-plane, a
larger applied ﬁeld is required to saturate the magnetiza-
tion, and the remanence is close to zero. Conversely, the
magnetic behavior of a 3 nm thick CFMS ﬁlm shown in
Fig. 1(d) indicates an in-plane easy axis of magnetization.
The uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy density KU
is a quantitative measure of the PMA strength, and is
determined from the diﬀerence in area under the out-
of-plane and in-plane magnetization curves, where pos-
itive values correspond to PMA. KU is plotted as a
function of tCFMS in Fig. 1(g), showing that the PMA is
strongest for the tCFMS = 1.5 nm ﬁlm, having a value
KU = 1.5 × 106 erg/cm3. This is comparable to val-
ues found for other Heusler alloys, which are typically
1 − 3 × 106 erg/cm3.10,12–14
The decreasing KU with increasing ﬁlm thickness and
the transition to in-plane magnetic anisotropy (negative
KU ) in Fig. 1(g) is a feature of magnetic thin ﬁlms usu-
ally attributed to the competition between interface in-

zation, while the tCFMS = 3 nm sample in (d) has an in-
plane easy axis.

duced PMA and the volume anisotropy, which tends to
favor an in-plane easy axis.15 The uniaxial anisotropy is
given by KU = KV − 2πM 2
s + KS/t, where KV and KS
are the bulk and interface anisotropy terms respectively,
and the term 2πM 2
s is the shape anisotropy. KU .tCFMS
is plotted against tCFMS in Fig. 1(h), where the intercept
of the linear extrapolation indicates KS = 1.08 erg/cm2.
The slope is equal to the eﬀective volume contribu-
tion KVef f = KV − 2πM 2
s = 5.3 × 106 erg/cm3. The
value of KS reported here is similar to that reported in
Co2FeAl10,16 (KS = 0.8 − 1.0 erg/cm2), but larger than
what has been measured in Co2MnSi stacks13 (KS =
0.5 erg/cm2) or multilayers12 (KS = 0.16 erg/cm2).

The Hall resistivity measured in a ferromagnetic ma-
terial is empirically given by ρxy = RH Hz + RAHEMz.17
It is the sum of the normal Hall eﬀect, linear in applied
ﬁeld (Hz), and the anomalous Hall eﬀect (AHE), which
is proportional to the out-of-plane magnetization (Mz).

with 0.75 ≤ tCFMS ≤ 3 nm. (f) Temperature dependent Hall
measurements for the sample with tCFMS = 0.75 nm showing
evidence of superparamagnetism. The AHE coeﬃcient shown
in (g) is determined by the zero-ﬁeld extrapolation of the
positive high-ﬁeld Hall data. RAHE shows an approximately
linear dependence on tCFMS with a sign change between 1.5
and 2 nm.

Therefore, measurements of the Hall eﬀect can be used
to probe PMA in thin ﬁlms. The AHE in Figs. 2(a)-(e)
conﬁrms the PMA for CFMS ﬁlm thicknesses 1 nm ≤
tCFMS ≤ 2 nm, which show 100 % remanence and a coer-
cive ﬁeld of around 25 Oe. The thicker 3 nm CFMS ﬁlm
in Fig. 2(e) shows an AHE characteristic of an in-plane
easy magnetic axis, with a saturation ﬁeld of about 3
kOe, in agreement with the magnetisation measurements
in Fig. 1(d).

Data for the 0.75 nm CFMS ﬁlm shown in Fig. 2(a)
shows superparamagnetic behaviour, similar to observa-
tions in CoFeB thin ﬁlms below the thickness threshold
for PMA.18 A large, hysteretic AHE only becomes ap-
parent at low temperature, as shown in Fig. 2(f). This
is probably an indication that the ﬁlm is not continu-
ous, with the discontinuous regions of the ﬁlm acting as
superparamagnetic particles at room temperature.

PMA in magnetic thin ﬁlms generally results from a
modiﬁcation of the orbital angular momentum due to hy-
bridization of orbitals at the interfaces. In MgO/CoFeB,
it is thought to be the Fe-O hybridization at the interface
that leads to the PMA3 although a thin metallic capping
layer, often Ta, has been shown to contribute also.19,20
PMA has also been observed and studied in Co/Pd and
Co/Pt multilayers,21 but in these cases, it is the Co 3d-
(Pd, Pt) 5d hybridization that is understood to induce
the PMA.22,23 While the data presented here indicate an
interfacial origin of the PMA in CFMS thin ﬁlms, sam-
ples with diﬀerent interfaces were prepared in order to

FIG. 3.
Similarly, a
MgO/CFMS(1.5)/MgO trilayer in (b) shows no evidence of PMA. (c) Hall measurements on a similar stack with a 3 nm CFMS
layer show in-plane magnetic anisotropy, as expected. Replacing the Pd with Cu results in in-plane magnetic anisotropy, shown
in the Hall measurement in (d). Hall measurements of MgO/CFMS/Pd trilayers with varying Pd thickness are shown in (e)-(g).
A thin Pd layer (tPd = 1.25 nm) in (e) gives no PMA, while thicker Pd layers do, as shown by the sharp, hysteretic AHE
observed for tPd ≥ 2.5 nm in (f) and (g).

understand which interface is important.

(i) Pd(2.5)/CFMS(1.5)/Pd(2.5):

SQUID measure-
ments show an in-plane easy axis for this stack [Fig. 3(a)],
demonstrating that the PMA is not from the CFMS-Pd
interface alone, and that the MgO layer plays an impor-
tant role.

(ii) MgO(2)/CFMS(1.5)/MgO(2): Magnetization
measurements of this stack in Fig. 3(b) show no evidence
of PMA. Interestingly, Hall and resistivity measurements
were not possible on this sample, suggesting the metallic
CFMS layer does not form a continuous ﬁlm. Hall mea-
surements were made on a similar stack with a thicker
CFMS layer (tCFMS = 3 nm) and are shown in Fig. 3(c).
The AHE with a large saturation ﬁeld is consistent with
an in-plane easy axis.

(iii) MgO(2)/CFMS(1.5)/Cu(3): Replacing the Pd
capping layer with a Cu layer of similar thickness (3 nm)
also destroyed the PMA. The Hall eﬀect measurement
in Fig. 3(d) shows a large saturation ﬁeld of 5 kOe and
zero remanence. This demonstrates the importance of
the CFMS/Pd interface for attaining PMA.

The thickness of the Pd layer also plays a role in
attaining PMA in the CFMS thin ﬁlm.
Figs. 3(e)-
(g) show Hall measurements for layers of the structure
MgO(2)/CFMS(1.5)/Pd(tPd) for tPd = 1.25, 2.5, 3.75 nm.
For tPd ≥ 2.5 nm, the CFMS has PMA, evidenced by
the sharp, hysteretic AHE in Figs. 3(f) and (g). For the
thinnest Pd layer (tPd = 1.25 nm), the ﬁlm reverts to
an in-plane magnetic anisotropy with a saturation ﬁeld
of about 1 kOe and no remanence or coercivity. This is
again similar to what is reported for CoFeB on MgO,
where a Ta layer above a threshold thickness is required
to attain PMA.24

While the AHE is proportional to the out-of-plane
magnetization, its sign and magnitude also depend on
a number of other properties of the material, including
the band structure, and various scattering mechanisms.17
The AHE coeﬃcient is deﬁned here as the zero-ﬁeld ex-

trapolation of the high-ﬁeld Hall eﬀect data for positive
applied ﬁelds. For CFMS thin ﬁlms in a MgO/CFMS/Pd
stack, we observe a thickness dependent AHE, as shown
in Fig.2(g). There is a change in the sign of RAHE between
tCFMS = 1.5 and tCFMS = 2.0 nm. This trend, and the sign
change, appears independent of the magnetic anisotropy,
which transforms from PMA to in-plane anisotropy be-
tween tCFMS = 2.0 and tCFMS = 3.0 nm. It is worth not-
ing that this AHE sign change also occurs with a change
in the Pd capping layer thickness, shown in Figs. 2(e-g).
While further work is required to understand the origin
of this eﬀect, we note that the AHE depends on spin- and
spin-orbit dependent scattering,17 and this system pro-
vides an opportunity to correlate these phenomena with
the structural, magnetic and electronic properties of a
highly spin-polarized magnetic material.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated PMA in
Co2FexMn1−xSi with x = 0.4 for thin ﬁlms in a
MgO/CFMS/Pd trilayer stack. Both the MgO and the
Pd layers are necessary to generate the PMA. This stack
shows promise for incorporation into a spin-transfer-
torque device with high thermal stability, low switching
current, and high output power. The observation of a
thickness-tunable AHE is an interesting, novel eﬀect, and
further work is required to elucidate its origin.
