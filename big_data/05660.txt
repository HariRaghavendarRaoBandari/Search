ABSTRACT

We present post–cryogenic Spitzer imaging at 3.6 and 4.5 µm with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) of the
Spitzer/HETDEX Exploratory Large-Area (SHELA) survey. SHELA covers ≈24 deg2 of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey “Stripe 82” region, and falls within the footprints of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy
Experiment (HETDEX) and the Dark Energy Survey. The HETDEX blind R ∼ 800 spectroscopy will produce
∼ 200,000 redshifts from the Lyman-α emission for galaxies in the range 1.9 < z < 3.5, and an additional
∼ 200,000 redshifts from the [O II] emission for galaxies at z < 0.5. When combined with deep ugriz im-
ages from the Dark Energy Camera, K-band images from NEWFIRM, and other ancillary data, the IRAC
photometry from Spitzer will enable a broad range of scientiﬁc studies of the relationship between structure
formation, galaxy stellar mass, halo mass, AGN, and environment over a co-moving volume of ∼0.5 Gpc3 at
1.9 < z < 3.5. Here, we discuss the properties of the SHELA IRAC dataset, including the data acquisition,
reduction, validation, and source catalogs. Our tests show the images and catalogs are 80% (50%) complete
to limiting magnitudes of 22.0 (22.6) AB mag in the detection image, which is constructed from the weighted
sum of the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 µm images. The catalogs reach limiting sensitivities of 1.1 µJy at both 3.6 and
4.5 µm (1σ, for R = 2′′ circular apertures). As a demonstration of science, we present IRAC number counts,
examples of highly temporally variable sources, and galaxy surface density proﬁles of rich galaxy clusters. In
the spirit of Spitzer Exploratory programs we provide all images and catalogs as part of the publication.

1. INTRODUCTION

The launch of the Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al.
2004) allowed for large surveys of galaxies at near-IR wave-
lengths, which are free from foreground terrestrial thermal
emission and are sensitive to the rest-frame peak of the stellar

emission in galaxies (λrest ∼ 1.6 µm) over redshifts z ∼ 1 - 2

(e.g., Eisenhardt et al. 2008; Papovich 2008; Muzzin et al.
2013a). During the cryogenic mission, Spitzer executed a va-
riety of initial, wide-area surveys (e.g., Lonsdale et al. 2003;
Ashby et al. 2009; Wilson et al. 2009), and the post-cryogenic
(“warm”) mission enabled much larger surveys with increas-
ingly larger combinations of depth and area (Mauduit et al.
2012; Ashby et al. 2013a,b, 2015; Labbé et al. 2013, 2015;
Timlin et al. 2015; Baronchelli et al. 2016).

The size and depth of the near-IR imaging surveys carried
out by Spitzer have expanded our knowledge of how dark mat-
ter halos accumulate baryons and convert them into stars. The

physics governing this formation involves a range of com-
plex processes (see the recent review by Somerville & Davé
2015, and references therein). The processes for the growth
of galaxies include baryon and dark-matter accretion histo-
ries, gas cooling, star formation, and galaxy mergers, while
the processes that inhibit this growth include energetic winds
from massive stars and supernovae, radiation and kinematic
feedback from AGN, and shock heating of gas in large dark
matter halos. Distinguishing the importance of these differ-
ent processes, and their dependence on halo and stellar mass,
redshift, and environment is one of the main goals of galaxy
formation theory.

Spitzer has allowed us to test some of the theoretical physi-
cal processes by comparing measurements of the galaxy stel-
lar mass distribution with model predictions. These processes
should manifest themselves as a function of galaxy stellar
mass, halo mass, redshift, and environment. By connect-

ing galaxies to their halos, we can identify and constrain the
relative importance of the physical processes responsible for
galaxy growth at different stages of their evolution. For ex-
ample, recent studies have attempted to measure the ratio
of galaxy stellar mass to halo mass (SM–HM) as a func-
tion of halo mass (e.g., Moster et al. 2010; Leauthaud et al.
2012; Moster et al. 2013; Behroozi et al. 2013; Kravtsov et al.
2014). The SM–HM relation provides a powerful mecha-
nism for connecting the predictions for the halo mass func-
tion (which is well understood, e.g., Springel et al. 2005;
Tinker et al. 2008; Behroozi et al. 2010, 2013) to the observed
stellar mass functions and mass–dependent spatial clustering
of galaxies (e.g., Weinberg et al. 2004; Reddick et al. 2013;
Hearin et al. 2014; Skibba et al. 2015).

ical volume at both moderate redshifts, 0.5 < z < 2.0, and at
high redshifts, 2.0 < z < 3.5, and opens the distant Universe
in the way that large-area, shallow surveys, such as the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, Alam et al. 2015) have expanded
our knowledge of the local Universe. As an equatorial ﬁeld,
the SHELA ﬁeld is accessible to terrestrial telescopes in both
hemispheres, which gives it a high and lasting legacy value for
studies of galaxy evolution, AGN, and large-scale structure.

1.1. Overview of Paper

Expanding tests of galaxy formation derived from the SM–
HM relation requires observational measurements of galaxies
over large areas to measure both the bulk statistics and scat-
ter in the halo- and stellar-mass distributions. This drives the
need for larger extragalactic surveys that cover areas contain-
ing the full range of environments in which galaxies form, and
during the epochs when the physical processes manifest.

Here, we describe one such program,

The post-cryogenic Spitzer mission has enabled such
surveys.
the
Spitzer/HETDEX Exploratory Large Area (SHELA) survey,
which is designed to measure the evolution of the nature of
the SM–HM relation for galaxies over a large baseline in red-
shift, 1.9 < z < 3.5. SHELA targets a ≈24 deg2 ﬁeld in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 ﬁeld (Annis et al.
2014), and covers a portion of the footprint of the Hobby-
Eberly Telescope (HET) Dark Energy eXperiment (HET-
DEX, Hill et al. 2008). The SHELA ﬁeld contains a large
amount of ground-based imaging, including griz data from
the Dark Energy Survey, additional ugriz data from our own
DECam imaging program (Wold et al. 2016, in preparation),
K-band data from the NEWFIRM instrument (Stevans et al.
2016, in preparation), and data in the far-IR, sub-mm, and X-
ray wavelengths (LaMassa et al. 2013a,b; Viero et al. 2014).
The large SHELA ﬁeld covers nearly 0.5 Gpc3 in cosmolog-

Here we present the overview of the Spitzer/IRAC imaging
dataset and catalogs for SHELA. The outline for this Paper
is as follows. In § 2, we describe the SHELA survey ﬁeld
and the survey strategy with the Spitzer space telescope. In
§ 3, we describe the data reduction and mosaicking of the
Spitzer dataset, and we describe astrometric and photometric
quality checks on the imaging data. In § 4, we discuss the
construction of the source catalog, and the catalog properties,
including source completeness. We also discuss estimates of
photometric errors. In § 5, we discuss basic scientiﬁc results,
including source number counts, temporally varying objects,
and the galaxy surface density of rich clusters.
In § 6, we
summarize the work.

Throughout, we denote photometric magnitudes measured
in the IRAC channel 1 and channel 2 as [3.6] and [4.5], re-
spectively. Unless stated otherwise, all magnitudes here are
relative to the AB system (Oke & Gunn 1983). For conve-
nience, we provide conversions between the AB system and
the system relative to Vega, [3.6]AB -
[3.6]Vega = 2.79 mag
and [4.5]AB -
[4.5]Vega = 3.26 mag, derived from a compari-
son to the spectrum a A0V spectral type star. Users of the
catalog may apply these to the ﬂux densities in the catalog to
convert them to the magnitude system relative to Vega. For
any derived, physical quantity, we assume a cosmology with
Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, and H0 = 70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1, consistent
with the WMAP seven-year data (Komatsu et al. 2011) and
Planck 2013 data (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014).

1.2. Overview of Data Products

Included with this paper we release science–quality ver-
sions of the reduced IRAC imaging and catalogs. All data
products are available through the NASA/IPAC Infrared Sci-
ence Archive (IRSA2). A full description of the imaging is
given in § 3.2, and the contents of our catalogs are detailed in
§ 4. Users may wish to skip to those sections. Here, we pro-
vide a high-level overview and some recommendations for the
use of these data.

The catalogs contain source ﬂux densities and their asso-
ciated errors in units of µJy, where the absolute bolometric
magnitude is then given by mAB = 23.9 - 2.5 log( fν /µJy) (see
§ 1.1). The catalog contains four different ﬂux density mea-
surements: one deﬁned using a circular 4′′ diameter aperture
(extension 4ARCS), one derived using a circular 6′′ diame-
ter aperture (extension 6ARCS), one formed using each ob-
jects’ isophotal apertures (extension ISO), and one created
using an elliptical aperture deﬁned from the objects’ light pro-
ﬁles using the Kron (1980) deﬁnition (extension AUTO). Each
of these ﬂux estimates has an associated uncertainty. Note
that we have used the IRAC point-response functions (PRFs;
see § 3.4 and § 3.5) to correct our ﬁnite aperture (i.e., the
4ARCS and 6ARCS) measurements for light falling outside
the deﬁned aperture; thus, these data should represent the to-
tal ﬂuxes for point sources. In contrast, the isophotal aperture
(i.e., ISO) measurements have not been corrected for missing
light. (By deﬁnition, the ﬂux densities measured in the Kron
[AUTO] aperture are “total” and require no correction.)

The choice of aperture will depend on the exact user re-
quirements of the application. For faint point sources, we
recommend using the ﬂux densities measured in 4′′-diameter
apertures (4ARCS), as these data contain the fewest low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) pixels, and hence have the highest
SNR overall. For brighter objects, or sources more extended
than ∼ 2′′, the larger aperture measurements are more appro-
priate. When the choice is uncertain, we recommend that
users compare the 4′′-diameter aperture ﬂux measurements
with those derived using the other apertures and check for ev-
idence of light loss.

2. FIELD AND SURVEY CHARACTERIZATION

2.1. HETDEX

HETDEX is a survey which will measure the redshifts of
8× ∼ 105 Lyα emitting galaxies (LAEs) between 1.9 < z <
3.5 using a suite of 78 wide-ﬁeld integral ﬁeld units (IFU)
spectrographs covering the wavelength region 350 - 550 nm
(Hill et al. 2008). The goal of these observations will be to
provide sub-percent level measurements of the Hubble expan-
sion parameter and the angular diameter distance at z ∼ 2 via
the large scale distribution of galaxies in the redshift range of
HETDEX. The result will be a signiﬁcant constraint on the
evolution of dark energy that is competitive with (and inde-
pendent of) values based on surveys of the Lyα forest (e.g.,
Slosar et al. 2013; Delubac et al. 2015).

The entire HETDEX survey will cover 420 deg2 with a
1/4.5 ﬁlling factor over two ﬁelds: a ∼ 300 deg2 northern
ﬁeld, and a ∼ 140 deg2 equatorial region. The ≈ 24 deg2
SHELA ﬁeld falls within the equatorial region, and, within
its borders, HETDEX will increase its ﬁll factor to unity (i.e.,
every portion of the SHELA ﬁeld will be targeted for spec-
troscopy). The 10σ detection limit for these spectra will be

Figure 2. Comparison of optical and IR magnitude limits for the SHELA
ﬁeld compared with ﬁducial model stellar populations. The colored bars
show the 3σ limits for the SHELA IRAC imaging derived in this Paper,
with preliminary values from our DECam and NEWFIRM imaging, as well
as the 50% completeness limits for the SDSS Stripe 82 survey data. The
curves show model stellar populations of a z = 2.5 star-forming “Lyman-break
galaxy” (LBG) with stellar mass log(M/M∗) = 10 and moderate extinction,
E(B - V) = 0.25, and a z = 1.5 passively evolving galaxy with age logt/yr =
9.3 and stellar mass log(M/M∗) = 10.3.

3.4× 10- 17 ergs cm- 2 s- 1 at 500 nm, or equivalently for con-
tinuum objects, gAB = 21.9 mag.

Figure 1 shows the location of the equatorial HETDEX ﬁeld
and the SHELA ﬁeld. The SHELA/IRAC imaging will de-
tect >200,000 galaxies at 1.9 < z < 3.5 down to a limiting
stellar mass of ≃ 2 - 3× 1010 M⊙. Figure 2 shows how the
SHELA IRAC 3σ ﬂux limits compare to the spectrum of a
star-forming galaxy at z = 2.5 (expected in both the LAE and
non–LAE populations), including the effects of nebular emis-
sion lines (Salmon et al. 2015), and a spectrum of a passive
galaxy at z = 1.5. The ﬁgure also shows the preliminary 3σ
magnitude limits from our DECam data (Wold et al. 2016,
in preparation) and NEWFIRM data (Stevans et al. 2016, in
preparation) and the 50% completeness limits for the opti-
cal imaging in the SDSS Stripe 82 ﬁeld (Annis et al. 2014).
The combined depths of the optical (ugriz), near-IR (Ks), and
mid-IR (3.6–4.5 µm) data will enable one to measure stellar
masses of galaxies to down to these ﬂux limits. This enables
the goal the combined HETDEX–SHELA dataset, which is
measure the stellar masses z ∼ 2.5 galaxies past the character-
istic mass, M∗, at these redshifts (e.g. Muzzin et al. 2013b;
Tomczak et al. 2014). Moreover, the combined HETDEX-
SHELA dataset will enable the measurement of the relation-
ship between halo mass (constrained by the HETDEX density
ﬁeld) and stellar mass (derived from the optical/IR photome-
try) over a survey volume large enough to minimize statistical
uncertainties.

Results from the HETDEX pilot survey using a prototype
of the HETDEX IFU on the McDonald 2.7m illustrate the im-
pact of joint spectroscopy and stellar-population modeling of
the LAE populations in small-area ﬁelds where optical/near-
IR imaging and Spitzer/IRAC imaging already exist. These
include results published in Adams et al. (2011), Blanc et al.
(2011), Finkelstein et al. (2011), Hagen et al. (2014), and
Chiang et al. (2015). The results of the pilot survey also give
us conﬁdence that we understand the properties of our LAE
selection, including their luminosity function and our ability
to select LAEs for HETDEX with little contamination.

2.2. Field Location and Ancillary Data

The SHELA ﬁeld is centered at R.A. = 1h22m00s, Decl.
= +00◦00′00′′ (J2000), (Galactic coordinates, l = 138.294◦,
b = - 62.017◦) and extends approximately ±6.5 deg in R.A.
and ±1.25 deg in Decl. The ﬁeld was chosen to have low IR
background (Schlegel et al. 1998) within the SDSS Stripe 82
and DES ﬁelds. As illustrated in Figure 1, the 100 µm back-
ground ranges from 1.2 to 1.7 MJy/sr across the ﬁeld, and
with a mean value of approximately 1.5 MJy/sr.
Because of its equatorial location, the SHELA ﬁeld lies
near the Ecliptic (λ = 18.93◦, β = - 8.01◦, and ranges in lat-
itude from β = - 4◦ to - 11◦). Because the primary compo-
nent of the background for Spitzer/IRAC is the Zodiacal light,
this results in a higher background than higher (Ecliptic) lat-
itude ﬁelds. The Ecliptic latitude for SHELA falls between
the values assumed for the “medium” and “high” background
in the Spitzer sensitivity performance estimation tool (SENS-
PET)3. Therefore, it is expected that the SHELA ﬁeld will
suffer higher-than average Zodiacal backgrounds, which ad-
versely effects the ﬂux sensitivity of the IRAC data.

An advantage of the equatorial location is that the SHELA
ﬁeld is readily observable by current and future optical/IR and
radio telescopes. The SHELA ﬁeld is centered on the equator,
and overlaps with the DES optical imaging, and the optical
imaging from the deeper SDSS/Stripe 82 coadd (Annis et al.
2014). These data are supplemented with our own deeper
CTIO/DECam ugriz data, which reaches 3σ limiting magni-
tudes of u = 26.0, g = 25.6, r = 25.4, i = 25.0, and z = 24.5
(in 2′′-diameter apertures). In addition, the ﬁeld is being im-
aged in the Ks band down to a 5σ depth of 22.8 mag using the
NEWFIRM camera at Kitt Peak (PI: S. Finkelstein). The DE-
Cam and NEWFIRM limits are illustrated in Figure 2. The
SHELA ﬁeld also has 250, 350, and 500 µm images from the
SPIRE instrument taken as part of the Herschel Stripe 82 Sur-
vey (HerS, Viero et al. 2014), and X-ray coverage from Chan-
dra and XMM-Newton (LaMassa et al. 2013a,b). Finally, the
SHELA ﬁeld has received microwave observations at 148,
218, and 270 GHz from the Equatorial Survey of the At-
acama Cosmology Telescope (ACT, Hasselﬁeld et al. 2013).
The growing amount of multiwavelength data makes SHELA
a unique resource for the study of physical properties of evo-
lution of galaxies as a function of environment.

Additional Spitzer/IRAC imaging of the SDSS Stripe 82
ﬁeld exists from the Spitzer IRAC Equatorial Survey (SpIES,
proposal ID (PID) 90045, PI: G. Richards; Timlin et al. 2015).
The SpIES data cover an additional ∼115 deg2 outside the
SHELA footprint along SDSS Stripe 82, with an effective
IRAC integration time of 120 s. Scaling by integration times,
the SHELA data are approximately 2.5 log(p270/120) =
0.44 mag deeper than SpIES. The reader is referred to
Timlin et al., for a description of SpIES and its data products.

from AOR 42817792 of SHELA. Each panel shows the same region of the
IRAC detector in a time series of sequential BCDs, from 0061–0066.
In
the ﬁrst three BCDs (0061-0063), the bright star (HD 9670, V = 6.9 mag)
falls at position 1, 2, and 3 in this portion of the IRAC detector. The bright
star leaves a fractionally small persistence effect (< 0.01% of the ﬂuence) in
the same x,y pixels in subsequent BCDs (0064–0066), which decays with an
exponential timescale.

2.3. SHELA IRAC Survey Strategy

IRAC (Fazio et al. 2004b) observes simultaneously in chan-
nel 1 (at 3.6 µm) and channel 2 (at 4.5 µm), with each chan-
nel covering a 5.′2× 5.′2 ﬁeld. The ﬁeld centers observed by
each channel are separated on the sky by approximately 6.7
arcminutes, with a gap of about 1.52 arcminutes between the
ﬁelds. We designed the mapping strategy for SHELA to ob-
tain coverage in both channels over approximately the same
area of sky.

Several constraints affected the design of our survey. We
desired multiple dithers with slightly different position angles
to allow redundancy, to identify cosmic rays, and to guard
against image defects. We desired observations during several
epochs to ease Spitzer scheduling requirements. The multiple
epochs are separated by long enough periods of time (approx-
imately 4–7 months) to identify time–variable objects includ-
ing asteroids (as our observations are close to the ecliptic we
expect asteroids to be detected at higher rates than higher–
latitude extragalactic ﬁelds). We also required that all astro-
nomical observation requests (AORs) be shorter than the max-
imum observing time, about 6 hours for Spitzer.

We divided the SHELA observations into three epochs, sep-
arated by approximately six months. There were two, 30-day
duration observing windows each year for Spitzer to observe
SHELA at position angles optimal for our survey strategy.

During each epoch we observed the entire SHELA ﬁeld
to one-third of the total depth, covering approximately 12 ×
2.5 deg2. Each AOR used a three point dither pattern, with 1
× 30 s frame time per position (where the array observes with
23.6 s of exposure time for a 30 s frame). Each AOR obtained
a map divided into 8 rows by 10 columns of IRAC pointings,
with a step size of 280′′ between each pointing. The area cov-
ered by each AOR is approximately 38′× 47′, and each epoch
tiled the entire SHELA ﬁeld using 64 AORS (epochs 1 and 3)
or 63 AORs (epoch 2). A single AOR required approximately
2.75 hrs of clock time. As there are 191 AORs, the total clock
time for SHELA required 525 hrs of Spitzer observations. The
Spitzer observations of SHELA occurred in the three epochs
using these AORS under program PID 80100 (PI: Papovich),
with dates listed in Table 1. The table also gives the position
angles of IRAC during the observations and the number of

AORs observed during each epoch.

The SHELA IRAC data reduction began with the data
pipeline processing version S19.0.0 of the IRAC Corrected
Basic Calibrated Data (cBCDs) provided by the Spitzer Sci-
ence Center (SSC). The data processing includes a subtrac-
tion of the dark current and application of the ﬂat ﬁeld, as
well as a photometric and astrometric calibration. Starting
with the cBCD products, we next applied several steps to
correct for variations and features in the image backgrounds.
We corrected each image for column–pulldown effects asso-
ciated with bright sources using custom software (“ﬁxpull-
down.pro”)4. We next constructed a median frame from all
cBCDs in a single AOR, clipping outliers.
In this way we
make a sky frame from all images in an AOR. We subtracted
this image from each individual cBCD to eliminate structure
and residuals. We then removed additional striping in the
backgrounds by averaging over ﬁve columns in each image
(clipping for objects), and subtracted this from each column.
We also excluded the ﬁrst frame from each series of exposures
in a given AOR sequence to remove any variable instrument
bias level associated with idiosyncrasies of the post-cryogenic
IRAC electronics (the “ﬁrst frame effect”5).

Our inspection of preliminary reductions showed some in-
stances where persistence from bright stars produced spuri-
ous sources in the ﬁnal mosaics. This occurs even though
the data-reduction pipeline ﬂags for image persistence (and
we set persistence–ﬂagged pixels as “fatal” during the mosaic
stage, see below), and suspect this occurs because the pipeline
ﬂags only persistence from the brightest objects (and fainter
objects, which still cause persistence, are missed). Figure 3
shows an example of the persistence caused by a bright star
(HD 9670, V = 6.9 mag) in a consecutive series of cBCDs
from one of the SHELA AORs. Following our observing
strategy, the star is dithered to 3 different positions on the de-
tector, before the IRAC array is stepped to a new location on
the sky. The persistence from the star is evident in several sub-
sequent exposures. The persistence fades with an exponential
timescale (as expected for trapped electron decay rates) and is
mainly a problem in the 3.6 µm images (it is nearly negligible
in the 4.5 µm images, see footnote 5).

To correct for the strongest persistence residuals, one of us
(CL) inspected visually each channel 1 cBCD sequentially in
the order they were observed, identifying persistence events.
We then ﬂagged those pixels with persistence using the loca-
tions of the bright objects in the previous cBCDs in the ob-
serving sequence. We combined these ﬂag maps with the
mask ﬁles produced by the SSC pipeline and included the
masked pixels as fatal bits in the mosaicking steps. Even so,
we have likely not accounted for all possible persistence in
the images. Persistence can manifest as “sources” that vary
in the time domain between observations in different epochs,
and users of the catalogs (especially for time-domain stud-
ies or sources detected in a single channel of an observing
epoch) should be wary that some time-variable sources may
be a result of faint persistence missed by our inspection of the
images.

We used a combination of the MOPEX software (v18.5.4)
provided by the SSC6 and SWarp (v2.19.1 Bertin et al. 2002)
to produce mosaics of the IRAC data. Our choice to use
SWarp is a result of the fact that the memory limitations of
MOPEX are too stringent for a dataset with the size of the
SHELA data volume. We ﬁrst produced a mosaic for each
AOR separately using MOPEX. MOPEX includes full propa-
gation of errors for each pixel and masks pixels set to fatal bit
patterns (including pixels we estimate to contain persistence,
see above).

We next used SWarp to mosaic the output

from
MOPEX for each AOR into images covering the full
SHELA ﬁeld. We employed a background subtrac-
tion with BACK_SIZE=128 and BACK_FILTERSIZE=3
within SWarp to account for (small) offsets in the back-
grounds between AORs. We combined AORs using a
weighted average (COMBINE_TYPE=WEIGHTED) from the
exposure-time maps for each AOR, and we resampled the im-
ages to a common ﬁeld center and pixel scale of 0.′′8 pixel- 1.
We produced full mosaics of all the data at 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm.
We also produced mosaics in each channel in each of the 3
observing epochs separately. Figures 4 and 5 show the com-
bined, three-epoch mosaics at 3.6 and 4.5 µm, respectively.

We also combined the weight maps using SWarp. Figures 4
and 5 show the weight map coverage for the full mosaic at
3.6 and 4.5 µm, respectively. The values in the weight map
correspond to the number of IRAC exposures for each pixel
on the sky, and the weight map is therefore proportional to
the effective exposure time, teff = 23.6 s × W , where W is
the value of the weight map. Figure 6 shows the distribution
of area covered to a given exposure time in the 3.6 µm and
4.5 µm full mosaics compared to the coverage from epoch 1
only. A single epoch covers each region of a 26 deg2 area with
three pointings from the dither pattern (W = 3), for an effective
exposure time, teff ≃71 s. The full mosaic covers an area of
30 deg2 with W = 6 pointings (teff = 142 s depth), 24.2 deg2
with W = 8.5 pointings (teff>200 s depth), and 22.4 deg2 with
W > 9 pointings reaching the full survey depth (teff > 212 s
depth).

3.3. Astrometric Quality

In preliminary versions of the SHELA IRAC mosaics, we
identiﬁed small astrometric offsets between cBCDs from dif-
ferent AORs. On subsequent re-reductions, we corrected for
these inter-AOR shifts using multiple tests.

We computed coarse astrometric offsets by cross-
correlating the positions of objects in each cBCD with sources
detected in the SDSS DR7 (Abazajian et al. 2009) catalog and
updating the image headers. The astrometric offsets were
mostly small, with shifts of up to ≈0.′′2 in both R.A. and
Decl. We then combined all cBCDs from all mosaics from
each epoch, and we again checked the absolute astrometry of
each mosaic, using the newer SDSS DR7 as a reference frame.
Finally, we corrected for the remaining (small) relative shifts
between each individual epoch. Compared to SDSS DR7 the
offsets of the 3.6 micron images were: ∆α = αSHELA - αDR7 =
- 140, +180, - 140 mas, and ∆δ = δSHELA - δDR7 = +60, - 80,
+50 mas, for epochs 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The offsets to
the 4.5 micron images were slightly different: ∆α = - 134,
+140, - 130 mas; and ∆δ = - 140, +110, - 150 mas, for epochs

1, 2, and 3, respectively. The origin of the offsets is unclear,
but may be related to the errors measured in the positions of
the stars in the Spitzer star trackers for the different space-
craft orientations (where the errors may be a combination of
uncertainties in the proper motions in the guide star catalog,
proper motions of stars in the 2MASS catalog used for the
pointing reﬁnement step of the IRAC pipeline, and intrapixel
sensitivity variations that add noise to the measured star posi-
tions). The orientation of epochs 1 and 3 were approximately
the same, while the spacecraft orientation for epoch 2 was dif-
ferent by approximately 180 degrees, and indeed, the largest
offsets were between epoch 1 and 2 and epochs 2 and 3 (see
above). We corrected for these astrometric offsets between
each epoch before combining the data into the ﬁnal mosaics.
Our tests showed that correcting for astrometric shifts for each
epoch improved the image quality of point sources in the ﬁnal
mosaic.

We remosaicked all the data using the improved astromet-
ric corrections. As a result, the ﬁnal astrometric solutions
are very good compared to SDSS DR7. Figure 7 shows
that offsets between SHELA and DR7 are indeed very small,
∆α = αSHELA - αDR7 = - 14 mas and ∆δ = δSHELA - δDR7 =
7 mas. For comparison, the scatter is σ(α) = 180 mas and
σ(δ) = 160 mas in each dimension. The scatter is compara-
ble to the quoted uncertainty in the SDSS DR7 astrometric
solution (Abazajian et al. 2009). We also rechecked the as-
trometry between SHELA and the newer SDSS DR9 coordi-
nates, and obtained similar values, with systematic shifts of
∆α = - 23 mas and ∆δ = 18 mas, and an overall scatter of
σ(α) = 160 mas and σ(δ) = 150 mas. The slight increase in the
offset between DR7 and DR9 is well within the uncertainty
in the absolute astrometric calibration of SDSS (Ivezi´c et al.
2007). The offsets are also small between SDSS DR7 and the
IRAC images from each individual epoch.

We also compared the astrometry between SHELA and the
2MASS all-sky point-source catalog (Skrutskie et al. 2006).
There are very small shifts of ∆α = - 8 mas and ∆δ = - 30 mas,
with scatter σ(α) = 270 mas and σ(δ) = 260 mas in each di-
mension. This is larger than the typical positional uncer-
tainty for Ks < 14 mag sources (. 100 mas, Skrutskie et al.

2006), but we have made no correction for proper motion
of stars, and the accuracy is consistent with that reported in
Sanders et al. (2007), who state an accuracy of ∼200 mas for
their Spitzer IRAC data.
There are larger shifts between the SHELA IRAC astrome-
try and the astrometry of point sources in the AllWISE catalog
(Cutri et al. 2013). Figure 7 shows that the offsets are ∆α =
- 53 mas and ∆δ = 69 mas, with scatter of σ(α) = 190 mas
and σ(δ) = 200 mas in each dimension. The scatter is consis-
tent with the astrometric uncertainty of the AllWISE catalogs
(Cutri et al. 2013), but the larger offsets in the astrometry (ap-
proaching a tenth of an arcsecond) may be non-negligible for
some applications.

3.4. Point Response Functions

For a variety of quality tests of the data and catalogs, it
is useful to have an empirical point response function (PRF)
for the 3.6 and 4.5 µm images. In each SHELA image, we
identiﬁed point sources from the AllWISE catalog brighter
than W 1 < 15 Vega mag with ﬂag value ex= 0. We kept ob-
jects only in the magnitude range 14 < W 1 < 15 Vega mag
as these have high signal-to-noise, are well away from being
saturated, and because brighter objects are weighted more in
the construction of the PRF. We constructed average PRFs us-
ing the routines provided in IDLPhot7, which is based on the
DAOPhot software (Stetson 1987). Figure 8 shows the PRFs
for the 3.6 and 4.5 µm data.8

We use the empirical PRF for tests of object photometric
accuracy and completeness in § 4.1 and § 4.2 below. We
measure a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 1.′′97 and
1.′′99 from Gaussian ﬁts to the 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm PRFs, re-
spectively. These agree with the expected values at the native
IRAC pixel scale for the IRAC channel 1 and 2 detectors dur-
ing the warm mission.9

We measured a curve-of-growth of the PRFs using circular
apertures and compared those to the ﬂux measured with the
ﬁducial IRAC aperture (radius R = 12′′) used to derive the
IRAC ﬂux calibration (see the IRAC Instrument Handbook,
link in footnote 5). The curve of growth provides an estimate
of the amount of light lost outside the photometric aperture.
For large apertures (R >2′′) these corrections are identical to
the ones we adopt below (§ 3.5), but they differ at the 0.05–
0.10 mag level for apertures R < 1 - 2′′.

3.5. Photometric Aperture Corrections

Because we used the SExtractor software package for ob-
ject photometry in our SHELA catalog (§ 4, below), we found
it advantageous to derive aperture corrections for point-source
photometry from the images themselves using the same pho-
tometric software package. We used the same bright (W 1 <
15 Vega mag) objects selected from the AllWISE catalogs
used for the construction of the PRF (see § 3.4). We then
photometered those objects in the IRAC images using SEx-
tractor with the same paramaters as the source catalog (see
§ 4 and and Table 3), using the AllWISE point sources as an
associated list with a search radius of 5 pixels (4′′). SExtrac-
tor photometered these sources with circular apertures rang-

these PRFs are available through IRSA, see

FWHMs for the PRFs ≈15% larger than for data taken during the the cold
Spitzer mission, see the IRAC instrument handbook, link in footnote 5.

the AllWISE astrometry has a non-negligible offset of ≈60–70 mas in both R.A. and Decl., with a scatter of 0.2′′ in each dimension.

ing in radius from 1′′ to 12′′, where the 12′′-radius aperture
“deﬁnes” the total aperture (see § 3.4, above).

Figures 9 and 10 compare the total R = 12′′ aperture magni-
tudes of the AllWISE stars in the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 µm frames
to measurements performed in smaller apertures. As is clear
from the ﬁgures, there are offsets owing to light lost outside
the smaller apertures. We measure aperture corrections based
on the median m(< R) - m(< 12′′) magnitude for stars with
magnitudes between 13.5 and 16 (AB) mag. (These median
offsets are denoted by the long-dashed red lines in the ﬁg-
ures.) At brighter magnitudes, .14 mag, the effects of satura-
tion cause the offsets to increase sharply, and become function
of magnitude. We caution against using small aperture mag-
nitudes in this regime, as they are unreliable.

Figure 11 shows the aperture corrections for the IRAC 3.6
and 4.5 µm data measured for point sources with magni-
tude between 13.5 and 16 mag in circular apertures, assum-
ing an R = 12′′ aperture encompasses the total light of a point
source. Table 2 lists the aperture corrections. Our measure-
ments are consistent with those of the IRAC Instrument Hand-
book (see footnote 5) and those derived in the literature (e.g.,
Ashby et al. 2009, 2013b) with differences at the < 0.05 mag
level. These differences likely depend on the method of pho-
tometry. We advocate the use of the aperture corrections de-
rived here as they use the same photometric parameters as the
source catalog. These corrections are accurate to better than
0.03 mag based on our comparison of the IRAC photometry

3.6. Photometric Quality:

Comparison between SHELA IRAC and AllWISE

A test of the photometric accuracy of the SHELA IRAC
data is possible by comparing the IRAC photometry to that
measured by WISE at 3.4 µm (W 1) and 4.6 µm (W 2). For
this test, we use the same point sources selected from the
AllWISE catalog matched to the IRAC data discussed in
§ 3.5, above, while applying an additional color cut, - 0.1 ≤
[3.6]Vega -
[4.5]Vega ≤ 0.0 to minimize potential color terms
in the stellar atmospheres10. Figure 12 shows the magni-
tude difference between the IRAC [3.6] and WISE W 1 pho-
tometry and between IRAC [4.5] and WISE W 2 photometry.
The AllWISE W 1 and W 2 catalogs have 5σ sensitivity lim-
its &16 mag (Vega, Cutri et al. 2013) so our comparison is
for stars well above this limit and biases should be minimal.
The difference between [3.6] - W 1 is negligible. The ﬁgure
shows this distribution, and a Gaussian ﬁt, which gives a mean
µ=0.001 mag and standard deviation, σ=0.023 mag.
Figure 12 shows the distribution of [4.5] - W 2, where a
Gaussian ﬁt gives a mean of µ = - 0.028 mag with σ =
0.021 mag. While this offset is small (- 0.028 mag), its ori-

gin is unclear. The offset is 1.4σ times the scatter, and corre-
sponds to a ﬂux ratio of 1.8%. Jarrett et al. (2011) ﬁnd similar
offsets and conclude these are consistent with the differences
in the IRAC and WISE bandpasses (the “relative system re-
sponse” curves), and the uncertainty in the calibration. A sim-
ilar offset is found by Cutri et al. (2013) between W 2 -
[4.5]
(see footnote 10) This offset persists regardless of the size of
the photometric aperture (once corrected to total), so a sys-
tematic offset in the aperture correction seems unlikely.
It
therefore seems to be consistent with differences in the WISE
W 2 and IRAC [4.5] spectral response curves.

sions for IRAC, this implies an IRAC–WISE color offset of
∼ 0.1 mag for Vega-like stars on the AB system (see also
Richards et al. 2015).
Furthermore, because the WISE bands are broader in wave-
length than the IRAC bands, they are more sensitive to the
molecular absorption in later-type stellar atmospheres (e.g.,
H2O, HCN, C2H2, CO), especially in the red giants, whose
contribution to the SHELA ﬁeld star counts may be substan-
tial. As illustrated in Figure 13 late-type supergiants should
have a IRAC–Wise photometric offset of of [4.5] - W 2 ≈
- 0.02 mag, a value consistent with that observed in the data
and that given in the literature (e.g., Jarrett et al. 2011). The
offset between [3.6] - W 1 is similarly small, though the fact
that the bandpass contains of very different set of absorption
features — H2O, C2H2+HCN bands at 3.8 µm as opposed to
CO bands at 5.0 µm (see Matsuura et al. 2005, 2014) — calls
this interpretation into question. Therefore, while the color
terms likely can explain the scatter in the IRAC–AllWISE
colors (Figure 12), they likely are not the cause of the system-
atic offset between the IRAC 4.5 µm and AllWISE 4.6 µm
photometry discussed above.

We furthermore considered (and rejected) the possibility
that there are additional color terms between the IRAC and
WISE photometry. Figure 13 shows the expected color be-
tween the IRAC and WISE bands for different stellar types,
using models from Kurucz (1993) over a range of luminos-
ity class and spectral type. The IRAC–WISE colors are zero
(relative to Vega) for early-type (i.e., Vega-analogs) main-
sequence stars. This is expected as these stars are used for
the calibration of the instruments.
However, the IRAC
and WISE ﬁlters have different central wavelengths and ﬁl-
ter widths. Therefore, there will be color terms depend-
ing on the source spectral energy distributions between the
IRAC and WISE bands. These color terms include color-
dependent transformations from the Vega to AB magnitude
system. Nominally, the WISE AB-to-Vega system conversion
constants are W 1AB - W 1Vega = 2.699 and W 2AB - W 2Vega =
3.338 (Jarrett et al. 2011). When compared to the conver-

Regardless of its origin, the offset is small, and is within
the uncertainty of the absolute IRAC calibration (Reach et al.
2005). Jarrett et al. (2011) argue the offset likely results from
a combination of absolute calibrations, aperture corrections,
and/or color corrections. The photometry is sufﬁciently ac-
curate for most science applications, although those requir-
ing better than 2% absolute photometric accuracy should be

4. SHELA IRAC CATALOGS

We used Source Extractor

(SExtractor v. 2.19.5;
Bertin & Arnouts 1996) to detect and to photometer sources
in the IRAC images. To detect sources, we constructed a
detection image as the weighted sum of the 3.6 and 4.5 µm

Note. — SExtractor was run using the weighted sum of the 3.6
and 4.5 µm images for detection, and using the images separately for
photometry. All SExtractor parameters are identical for both images.
All other SExtractor parameters are set to the program defaults (for
SExtractor v.2.19.5).

compares the transmittance of the IRAC [3.6] and [4.5] ﬁlters to the WISE

models for dwarfs (luminosity class V), giants (class III), and supergiants
(class I) over a range of effective temperature (spectral type). Because the
WISE instrumental ﬁlters are wider, they can include bandhead absorption
features in late-type stars, affecting the IRAC–WISE color up to 0.03 mag.

tively, and I1 and I2 are the science (ﬂux) images for channel 1
and 2, respectively. We then ran SExtractor in “double image
mode” using the detection image and science images with the
parameters listed in Table 3. Tables 7 and 8 provide all the

information from the full-mosaic catalogs.

We also constructed catalogs for the mosaics from each
of the three observing epochs individually. For each epoch,
we used the detection for the combined images (see eq. 1
above). In this way, sources detected in the combined epoch,
3.6+4.5 µm image are photometered in each image from each
epoch. We used the identical SExtractor parameters as for the
full-mosaic catalogs (Table 3). Tables 9–11 provide the pho-
tometry from the individual epoch data.

4.1. Completeness Simulations

We performed simulations to estimate the completeness
in the SHELA IRAC catalogs following the method in
Papovich et al. (2015). We inserted fake point sources into the
3.6 and 4.5 images using the empirical PRFs derived above
(§ 3.4). We inserted each fake source at the same (α, δ) loca-
tion in the 3.6 and 4.5 µm images, where the source has the

Figure 14. Completeness for point-sources in the SHELA data as a function
of the input source magnitude. The plot shows the recovery fraction as a func-
tion of magnitude for simulated point sources, which are added to both the 3.6
and 4.5 µm images with the same AB magnitude. The solid–line histogram
shows the raw completeness fraction. The dashed–line histogram shows the
completeness corrected for “false positives” (sources that are “recovered” in
the image, in which no simulated sources are added), which shows only slight
differences with respect to the raw completeness fraction. The solid, dashed,
and dot-dashed horizontal lines show 100%, 80%, and 50% completeness.
same total brightness (AB magnitude) in each channel. Fake
sources were assigned magnitudes chosen randomly from a
wide distribution (17–24th magnitude), and the sources are
located randomly in the images.
In this way fake sources
may fall within the isophotes of real objects in the image,
and therefore our completeness simulations include the ef-
fects from blended objects. We reconstructed the detection
image as the weighted sum of the 3.6 and 4.5 µm images and
reran SExtractor. This latter step was computationally expen-
sive given the size of the images (see above; Equation 1). We
repeated the simulation only 15 times, where we inserted into
each simulated image 10,000 fake sources (≈0.4% the total
number of real sources).
In this way we sampled the full
range of source magnitude using a minimum investment of
resources.

We computed the completeness as the ratio of the number
of recovered (detected) fake sources to the number of input
fake sources in bins of source magnitude. Figure 14 shows
the completeness, where the 50% (80%) completeness limit
is 22.6 (22.0) AB mag. Table 4 gives these as the “raw” com-
pleteness as a function of source magnitude in the detection
image. We also added to the completeness a correction for
“false positives”, sources at the location of the fake that are
“recovered” even when no sources are added to the image.
Table 4 gives these as the “completeness”. As illustrated in
Figure 15 the difference between the raw completeness and
the completeness corrected for false positives is small, ac-
counting for only 1% of recovered sources down to the 50%
completeness limit.

4.2. Error Estimates

We estimate uncertainties for sources in the IRAC catalogs
using two methods. We ﬁrst used the simulations from § 4.1
to estimate the uncertainty for point sources of a given mag-
nitude.
In each of the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 µm images, we

computed the difference between the input (“true”) magni-
tude and measured magnitude from SExtractor in R = 2′′ radii
(corrected to total using the aperture corrections in Table 2).
Figure 15 shows the median and inter-68-percentile of the
distributions of these differences as a function of [3.6] and
[4.5]magnitude. The mean offset is near zero down to ≈22.2
mag (below the 80% completeness limit). In each bin of mag-
nitude, we compute the ratio σ/Fν (the inverse of the SNR) as
a measure of the relative error for sources of that magnitude.
The solid black line of Figure 16 shows this ratio as a function
of [3.6] and [4.5]. This yields a limiting SNR=5 at 22.0 AB
mag, or a 1σ limit of 1.1 µJy for both [3.6] and [4.5].

This 1σ ﬂux-density limit is consistent with estimates from
the Spitzer SENS-PET for ﬁelds with higher background.
SENS-PET gives for the “warm” Spitzer mission a 1σ limit
for point sources of 0.9–1.2 µJy and 1.1–1.6 µJy for 3.6 and
4.5 µm observations for “medium” and “high” background
(where as noted above, the medium and highs backgrounds in
SENS-PET assume a sightline with latitude β = 40◦ and 0◦
from the Ecliptic); therefore the values we derive are reason-
able.

Figure 16 shows a “kink” in the error estimated from the
simulations for both [3.6] and [4.5] below & 22.5 mag (black,
solid-lined curves in each panel of the ﬁgure). This is likely
a bias owing to incompleteness of recovered sources. The
50 and 80% completeness limits are 22.6 and 22.0 mag, re-
spectively. Figure 15 shows that in this magnitude range, the
median difference between recovered and input photometry is
biased to positive values because fainter sources are missed in
the catalog. Therefore, at these magnitudes, the distribution
is clipped, and the inter-68 percentile range is biased smaller.
This means the errors estimated from the simulations underes-
timate the true photometric uncertainty for sources with mag-
nitudes below about the 80% completeness limit. Partly for
this reason we will adopt the alternative method to estimate
errors, described in the rest of this subsection below.

Second, we derived error estimates from the noise in the
images in apertures of increasing number of pixels, N, where
N ∝ A, the area of the photometric aperture. The ﬂux uncer-
tainty within an aperture has a contribution from photon statis-
tics. The theoretical uncertainty in an aperture with N pixels
√N, where σ1 is the standard
would then scale as σN = σ1 ×
deviation of background pixels. This relation assumes that
the pixel values are independent (uncorrelated). In practice,
multiple effects are expected to introduce some pixel–to–pixel
correlation, such as image alignment and mosaicking, sky
subtraction, the extended wings of bright sources, and the ﬂux
from undetected objects. The limiting case of perfect correla-
tions between pixels implies that the uncertainty in an aperture
of N pixels should scale as σN = σ1 × N (Quadri et al. 2007).
Generalizing, we expect the uncertainty to scale with Nβ with
0.5 < β < 1, between the limiting cases of uncorrelated pix-
els and perfectly correlated pixels (see also Labbé et al. 2003;
Gawiser et al. 2006; Blanc et al. 2008; Whitaker et al. 2011).
We estimated the noise as a function of pixels by measuring
the sky counts in circular apertures of varying size in ≈5000
randomly placed regions in the SHELA IRAC images, ensur-
ing that apertures do not overlap, and excluding regions con-
taining objects. We then computed the standard deviation of
the distribution of aperture ﬂuxes from the normalized median
absolute deviation, σnmad (Beers et al. 1990), as an estimate
for σN for each aperture with N pixels. Figure 17 shows the
measured relation of σN as a function of √N for the 3-epoch

decrease roughly with the square-root of the exposure time
such that the value of σ1 for the 3-epoch combined image is
roughly √3 lower than that for an individual epoch. The ﬁtted
values for the slope in the ﬁrst term, β ∼ 0.6 - 0.7, are consis-

tent with partially correlated pixels, as found in other imaging
surveys (e.g., Gawiser et al. 2006; Quadri et al. 2007). The
values for γ are relatively small (the ratio of the coefﬁcients
is α/γ ∼ 5 × 102 - 5 × 105), implying there is a small, but

increasing correction to the noise model for apertures with
larger numbers of pixels.

The red points in Figure 16 show the magnitude uncertainty
calculated for 2′′-radius apertures (scaled up to the total aper-
ture) as a function of [3.6] and [4.5]. There is generally good
agreement between the estimated uncertainties from σN and
those from the simulations described above. For objects with
<22 AB mag, there is a slight offset, where the estimates from
σN are lower at about the 0.02 mag level compared to the es-
timates from the completeness simulations. This could arise
from several effects, including the fact that the completeness
simulations allow fake objects to fall on image regions that
contain other (real) galaxies. As this will tend to increase the
average difference between the input and recovered magni-
tude, an offset is not unexpected. We include an additional
0.02 mag systematic uncertainty into our estimates to account
for this effect (see below).

For the IRAC catalogs, we computed errors using Equa-
tion 2 for the number of pixels N in the aperture used to mea-
sure the object, scaled up to the total aperture. We add these
errors in quadrature with an additional error σsys = 0.02 mag,
to account for systematics derived from the completeness sim-
ulations (see § 4.1 and Table 2). The total photometric error,
σi,c on each source i in IRAC channel c is then given by,

Figure 17. Scaling relation between the measured noise in the SHELA IRAC
images and the square root of the number of pixels, √N, in the area of the
photometric aperture. Both panels show the measured noise, σN , in each
aperture of N pixels. The top panel shows the 3.6 µm data and the bottom
panel shows the 4.5 µm data. In each panel, the bottom-most dashed line
shows the theoretical relation assuming uncorrelated pixels in the Gaussian
√N. The top-most dashed line shows the relation for perfectly

shows the parameterized ﬁt to the data, which we use to deﬁne the ﬂux un-
certainties measured in different-sized apertures.

IRAC [3.6] and [4.5] images.

Following the suggestion in Labbé et al. (2003), we ﬁt a
parameterized function to estimate the noise in an arbitrary
aperture of linear size N,

σN = σ1 (cid:0)αNβ + γNδ(cid:1)

(2)
where σ1 is the pixel-to-pixel standard deviation in the sky
background, and α, β, γ, and δ are free parameters. We re-
quired that α and γ be non-negative, that 0.5 < β < 1, and
we placed no restrictions on δ. In this way the ﬁrst term of
Equation 2 represents the expected noise for partially corre-
lated pixels. The second term includes an additional correc-
tion that better reproduces the noise in large apertures (see
also, Labbé et al. 2003). Table 5 lists the parameters for the
ﬁts in Equation 2 for the combined, 3 epoch IRAC 3.6 and
4.5 µm data. The table also includes ﬁts for the individual
IRAC epoch data (where our tests showed each individual
epoch had noise properties consistent with being the same, so
we combined the random apertures of all individual images
for a single ﬁt).

The product of σ1α reﬂects the pixel-to-pixel rms, and these

where Fi,c is the ﬂux density of each object in each channel,
σ2
N,c is given by Equation 2 for each channel, wi,c is the value
of the weight map at the location of each object, and wmed,c
is the median value of the weight map in each channel. We
opted to use these uncertainty estimates as they can be scaled
to arbitrarily sized apertures (unlike the errors on the simula-
tions, which are otherwise valid only for point sources).

4.3. Catalogs

With this Paper, we publish the full SHELA photometric
catalog. The catalogs include the IRAC ﬂuxes measured in
multiple apertures (4′′ and 6′′ diameter circular apertures, cor-
rected to total magnitudes, isophotal magnitudes, and the “to-
tal” (MAG_AUTO) magnitudes from SExtractor). Errors are
estimated from Equation 2 and Table 5 for the number of pix-
els for each object/aperture. In addition, we include a catalog
with photometry for the IRAC sources from the SDSS Stripe
82 coadd ﬁeld (Annis et al. 2014) in ugriz, where sources
in the SHELA catalog have been matched to the astromet-
ric positions of sources in the SDSS Stripe 82 catalogs using
a 1′′ search radius. Only SDSS sources matched to SHELA
sources are included in the catalog, and we include only the
closest source in the cases where multiple SDSS sources are
located within 1′′ of a given SHELA source.

Table 6 provides a description of each column name in the
tables and the binary FITS tables. Table 7 contains object
astrometry and quantities measured from the detection im-

age and weight maps. Tables 8–11 present the SHELA cat-
alogs for the data release. This includes a catalog for the full,
combined 3-epoch data (Table 8) and catalogs for each indi-
vidual epoch (Tables 9-11). The full catalogs are provided
as binary tables in Flexible Image Transport System (FITS,
Hanisch et al. 2001) format.

The SExtractor ﬂags (FLAGS (3.6µm) and FLAGS
(4.5µm)) are stored as bits and coded in decimal as the sum
of powers of 2 (2bit) for bits that are ﬂagged. Common ﬂag bit
values are:
bit 1 The object has bright neighbors that may bias the pho-
tometry, or the object has more than 10% of its pixels
ﬂagged as bad or have zero weight;

bit 2 The object was deblended from another object.
Neither ﬂag bit value is fatal, but users may require a more
thorough vetting of these sources depending on their needs.

Other, higher (very uncommon in the SHELA catalogs) bit
values denote objects whose photometry is dubious. These
objects should likely be excluded from use. These bits are
available in the SExtractor User’s Manual (v2.13).

The column descriptions for the binary FITS table and ta-
ble for the merged SHELA–SDSS Stripe 82 catalog are listed
in Table 12. Table 13 presents the photometric data for the
merged SHELA–SDSS Stripe 82 catalog.

In the catalogs, objects with no coverage (in a given wave-
length and/or epoch) will have weight = 0 and zero ﬂux den-
sity and error. These objects also have SExtractor bit=1 set
in their ﬂag values. The catalogs and images are available as
part of this publication through IRSA, see footnote 2

Because sources are detected in the weighted sum combina-
tion of the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 µm data, the catalogs contain dif-
ferent numbers of sources detected in 3.6 µm and 4.5 µm indi-

vidually. Table 14 provides the number of sources detected in
different combinations of the 3.6 and 4.5 µm bands based on
the requirement that sources be detected in at least one of the
two channels with signiﬁcance SNR ≥ 3. The table shows the
number of sources for the SNR deﬁned in different apertures.
Clearly, the 4′′–diameter apertures provide SNR ≥ 3 for the
most sources. This is expected as this aperture encompasses
∼75% of the light for unresolved objects, while containing
the fewest low SNR pixels. Therefore for objects whose light
is well contained with 4′′–diameters, we recommend this cat-
alog as it maximizes the SNR. Catalog users can determine if
the 4′′–diameter aperture is too small by comparing the ﬂux
densities measured in this aperture and those in larger aper-
tures (the 6′′–diameter aperture and the Kron, _AUTO aper-
ture, for example), and make decisions about aperture choice
for their speciﬁc requirements.

5. A MODICUM OF SCIENCE

5.1. Number Counts

Galaxy number counts provide tests of galaxy evolu-
tion and cosmology (e.g., Peebles 1993).
The number
counts are the integral over the luminosity function and dis-
tance (redshift), containing the total contribution of galax-
ies of a given luminosity and distance to the cosmic back-
ground emission. The galaxy number counts in the mid-
IR are particularly useful as they contain information about
stellar-mass growth, dust–obscured populations, and AGN.

Galaxy number counts with Spitzer have demonstrated the
abundance of faint sources attributed to (rest-frame) near-
IR and mid-IR emission from distant galaxies and their
contribution to the IR background (e.g., Fazio et al. 2004a;
Papovich et al. 2004; Dole et al. 2004; Sanders et al. 2007;
Ashby et al. 2009, 2013b; Mauduit et al. 2012).

Figure 18 shows the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 µm number counts
for the full SHELA data. The raw counts (uncorrected for
completeness, see § 4.1) are provided in Table 15. The
SHELA counts agree well with previous measurements (e.g.,
Fazio et al. 2004a; Sanders et al. 2007). At bright magnitudes
(AB . 18) the counts follow roughly the expected contribu-
tion from Galactic stars (e.g., Fazio et al. 2004a; Ashby et al.
2013b, and references therein). The SHELA counts show a
slight excess of bright counts compared to the data in Fazio
et al. and Sanders et al. This is likely a result of the different
Galactic sight lines among the surveys, and is therefore not
too surprising.

The counts provide an independent measure of the com-
pleteness of the SHELA IRAC catalogs. As illustrated in
Figure 18, the SHELA counts agree with those of the deeper
imaging in Fazio et al. (2004a) and Sanders et al. (2007) to
better than 10% near the peak of the distribution. Similarly,
when corrected for incompleteness (§ 4.1), the SHELA data
are consistent with the counts in Fazio et al. and Sanders et
al. at least down to the 50% completeness level of mAB ∼
22.5 mag. At fainter magnitudes, the completeness correc-

pleteness corrections in Table 4.
tions for the SHELA data are signiﬁcantly higher and the
uncertainties on the completeness corrections dominate the
counts (and Eddington–type biases are most severe). There-
fore, we have conﬁdence in the completeness corrections and
the number counts down to the 50% completeness limit.

5.2. Time-Variable Objects

The combination of the large area and multi-epoch nature
of the SHELA dataset allows for the identiﬁcation of sources
whose brightness varies across the ∼6 and 12 month baselines
in time. This includes rare sources that show large changes
in brightness, and sources with high proper motion (see also,
Ashby et al. 2009).

As an illustration, we selected objects from the SHELA cat-
alog that are detected in both the combined 3.6 and 4.5 µm
data, have coverage in all three observing epochs, but vary by
more than 2.5 mag (a factor of 10 in brightness) between any
two observing epochs. There are 291 objects in the SHELA
ﬁeld that satisfy these requirements with [3.6]≤ 20.5 AB mag
or [4.5]≤ 20.5 AB mag. An inspection of these objects shows
they are all consistent with point sources, with several “dou-
ble” (resolved, or multiple component) objects and some ob-
jects that appear to show astrometric centroid shifts between
the 3.6 and 4.5 µm image (which would imply very high
proper motions, indicative of asteroids). Figure 19 shows four
objects that appear in only a single observing epoch. Because
such objects make it into the ﬁnal, three-epoch, combined cat-
alog, care must be taken when creating object sets that require
no (signiﬁcant) temporal variations.

5.3. The Relation between the Scale Radius and Mass of

Dark-Matter Halos

The ACT survey includes the SHELA IRAC footprint, and
its catalog includes SZ emission from distant (z < 1) clusters
in the Stripe 82 ﬁeld (Hasselﬁeld et al. 2013). The thermal SZ
effect is a decrement in the emission from the CMB owing to
the presence of a massive (virialized) galaxy cluster along the

line of sight. The hot (T ∼ 107 - 108 K) ICM gas associated

with the galaxy cluster causes inverse Compton scattering of
the CMB photons, leaving a distortion in the direction of the
cluster. The strength of the distortion is proportional to the
line-of-sight integral of the thermal pressure (the Compton y
parameter), which correlates with the total mass (M500) as-
sociated with the galaxy cluster (e.g., Vikhlinin et al. 2009;
Marrone et al. 2012; Sifón et al. 2013).

in the SHELA/IRAC footprint

Five of the ACT clusters from Hasselﬁeld et al. (2013)
fall
(ACT CLJ0059.1-
0049, ACT CLJ0127.2+0020, ACT CLJ0119.9+0055, ACT
CLJ0058.0+0030, ACT CLJ0104.8+0002). The IRAC data
probe the amount of starlight associated with the galaxies in
these clusters, and measure the galaxy spatial distribution.
The combination of IRAC and ACT data therefore allows us
to study the structural size of the dark matter halo (as traced
by the galaxies in the IRAC image) and compare it with the
halo mass as estimated from the SZ signal. Figure 20 shows
false-color images of the ﬁve clusters in the SHELA IRAC
3.6 µm image (red-color) combined with i– and g–band im-
ages from our DECam imaging (Wold et al., in preparation).
Studies have shown that the surface density of satellites
roughly trace the distribution of dark matter (e.g., Tal et al.
2012; Kawinwanichakij et al. 2014; van der Burg et al. 2015)
predicted by the density proﬁle of the dark matter from nu-
merical simulations (e.g., Navarro et al. 1996, NFW here-
after). The Spitzer/IRAC data allow the measurement of
the radial distribution of galaxies, and therefore a tracer of
the dark matter density distribution. Following the method
of Kawinwanichakij et al. (2014), we counted the number of
SHELA galaxies with 17 < m3.6 < 22 mag in concentric an-
nuli centered on each cluster. To correct for the background,
we measured the average (median) number of galaxies in each

for the IRAC 3.6 µm data. The top right panel shows the results for the 4.5 µm data. The bottom panels show the differential number counts normalized to a

In each panel the heavy black histogram shows the IRAC counts with no correction for completeness. The

counts from S-COSMOS (Sanders et al. 2007) and the dot-dashed line shows counts from the IRAC GTO data (Fazio et al. 2004a). The counts near the “peak”
of the emission (in the lower panels) are consistent to better than 10%.

projected NFW proﬁle with a best ﬁt scale radius, θs = 0.51±
0.14 arcmin, which corresponds to a physical scale radius of
rs = 223± 65 kpc (for h = 0.7, Ωm = 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7).
The combination of data on the radial distribution of clus-
ter galaxies and measures of the total mass of the clus-
ters is a potentially powerful way to study properties of
dark matter halos.
the scale ra-
dius is expected to increase with halo mass as rs ∼ M0.45
200
(Navarro et al. 1996), where M200 is the mass within a ra-
dius where the density is 200 times the critical density. Sim-
ulations predict that this relation should be constant con-
stant with redshift (e.g., Bullock et al. 2001; Eke et al. 2001;
Diemer & Kravtsov 2015).

For an NFW proﬁle,

Figure 22 shows the ratio of rs/M0.45

200 for the ﬁve ACT SZ
clusters in the SHELA ﬁeld as a function of their redshift. The
rs values come from the projected NFW proﬁle ﬁts to the ra-
dial distributions of galaxies for each cluster from the IRAC
catalogs (as described for CLJ0058.0+0030 in the previous
paragraph). The M200 values come from the estimates of M500
from the SZ y-parameter measurements (Hasselﬁeld et al.
2013), where we have adjusted the M500 values by 0.1 dex
to convert them to M200. Figure 22 also shows the values
of rs/M0.45
200 for the simulated model halos from Navarro et al.
(1996), for halos ranging from M200 = 1013 - 1015 M⊙. The
200 ≃ 0.1 - 0.2 Mpc / (1014 M⊙)0.45,
values range from rs/M0.45
and agree remarkably well with the observations for the 5
ACT-SZ clusters. These are consistent with the expected
evolution of more modern simulations for a halo of mass
1013 - 1015 M⊙ (Diemer & Kravtsov 2015). The observations
show indications that the shape of the dark–matter proﬁles has
only a weak dependence on mass and redshift in accordance
with predictions from ΛCDM (Bullock et al. 2001).

6. SUMMARY

We presented the Spitzer IRAC imaging at 3.6 and 4.5 µm
of the SHELA survey, a Spitzer Exploratory program which
covers a ≈24 deg2 ﬁeld within the footprint of HETDEX. This
ﬁeld has a rich set of multiwavelength data, including opti-
cal imaging from SDSS Stripe 82 and CTIO/DECam, near-
IR imaging from NEWFIRM K-band, far-IR imaging from
Herschel, and X–ray observations from Chandra and XMM-
Newton.

The HETDEX survey will obtain redshifts in this ﬁeld for
∼ 200,000 galaxies at 1.9 < z < 3.5 based on Lyman-α emis-
sion (covering a volume of 0.5 Gpc3), and redshifts for an
additional ∼ 200,000 galaxies at z < 0.5 based on their [O II]
emission. The SHELA IRAC data are sensitive to galaxies
with stellar masses down to ≃ 2× 1010 M⊙ through the red-
shift range of Lyman-α probed by HETDEX. Thus, the com-
bination of the HETDEX spectroscopy data, ground-based
optical/near-IR imaging, and the SHELA IRAC data allow the
study of the relationship between structure formation, galaxy
stellar mass, dark halo mass, and environment during over a
large range of cosmic history.

In this Paper we discussed the properties of the SHELA
IRAC data, including the data acquisition, reduction, valida-
tion, and source catalogs. The imaging includes three ob-
serving epochs separated by approximately 6 months between
epochs. The combined three-epoch dataset covers 24.2 deg2
with an exposure time of at least ≈200 s. Our tests show the
images and catalogs are 80% (50%) complete to limiting mag-
nitudes of 22.0 (22.6) AB mag in the detection image, which
is constructed from the weighted-sum of the IRAC 3.6 and

Figure 21. The left panel shows the SHELA IRAC 3.6 µm image of the ACT
SZ-selected cluster CLJ0058.0+0030 at z = 0.76 (Hasselﬁeld et al. 2013).
The right panel shows the projected surface-density distribution of galaxies
centered on the peak of the SZ signal of the cluster. The surface density is
the number of galaxies in the SHELA IRAC data measured in concentric an-
nuli centered on the cluster, corrected for the average density of galaxies in
random apertures in the IRAC image. The surface density is consistent with
a projected NFW proﬁle with scale radius 0.51± 0.14 arcmin.

Figure 22. The evolution of the ratio between the NFW-proﬁle scale radius,
rs and halo mass, M200. The boxes and error bars show values derived for
the ACT-selected clusters in SHELA. The scale radii are measured by ﬁt-
ting projected NFW proﬁles to the surface density of galaxies in each ACT
cluster. The asterisks show the predicted ratio of rs/M0.45
200 for galaxy ha-
los from NFW96. The hatched swaths show the expected ratio for halos of
log M200/M⊙ = 13, 14, and 15 (as labeled in the ﬁgure legend) including
the scatter in halo concentration using the relations in Diemer & Kravtsov
(2015). The data are consistent with a near unevolving ratio of rs/M0.45 over
a large baseline in redshift, with values consistent with DM halo scaling re-
lations as expected from the distribution of predicted ratios for a CDM–type
cosmology.

annulus for 104 randomly placed apertures around the SHELA
image (taking care to avoid the image edges). We then mea-
sured the radial proﬁle, and ﬁt the projected NFW proﬁle
(Bartelmann 1996) using two parameters, the NFW scale an-
gular radius, θs, and a normalization. The results from these
ﬁts for the NFW scale radii for each cluster are given in Ta-
ble 16.

Figure 21 shows the distribution of galaxies centered on one
of the ACT clusters in SHELA, ACT CLJ0058.0+0030 at z =
0.76. The galaxy distribution has been corrected statistically
for the galaxies associated with the ﬁeld as discussed above.
The ﬁgure shows that the surface density of galaxies follows a

4.5 µm images. The catalogs reach limiting (1σ) sensitivities
of 1.1 µJy in each IRAC channel. The photometric accuracy
is consistent with AllWISE with essentially no different be-
tween the [3.6] and W1 bands and a possible 0.02 mag offset
between [4.5] and W2 bands.

The astrometric solution of SHELA is tied to SDSS DR7,
where the astrometric uncertainty is <0.′′2, comparable to
the uncertainty in the SDSS catalogs. The astrometric solu-
tions are accurate compared to 2MASS, but show a (possibly)
non-negligible offset compared to AllWISE approaching one-
tenth of an arcsecond.

The IRAC data enable a broad range of scientiﬁc explo-
rations, including studies of galaxy and AGN evolution, and
the formation of large-scale structure. As a demonstration of
science, we present IRAC number counts, examples of highly
temporally variable sources, and galaxy surface density pro-
ﬁles of rich galaxy clusters. At faint magnitudes, the source
number counts are consistent with other IRAC datasets, which
provides conﬁdence in our estimated completeness correc-
tions. At bright magnitudes we observe a possible excess of
counts, which we attribute to variations in the surface density
of Galactic stars.

We use a sample of ﬁve ACT SZ–selected galaxy clusters
between 0.2 < z < 0.8 to study the relation between cluster
mass (traced by the SZ Compton parameter) and the scale ra-
dius, rs, of the cluster halos as traced by the surface distri-
bution of galaxies as measured from the SHELA IRAC data.
All clusters show galaxy surface densities in agreement with
a projected NFW halo, with a ratio of rs/M0.45
200 that is consis-
tent with simulations of dark matter halos and is unevolving
in redshift, as predicted by ΛCDM models.

In the spirit of Spitzer Exploratory programs we provide
all images and catalogs as part of this Paper. We describe
the source IRAC catalogs and imaging products released for
the SHELA data, which will be available through IRSA (see
footnote 2).
