Supersymmetric Standard Model

Abstract

We study the 2010 speciﬁc version of the 2002 proposed U (1)X extension of the su-
persymmetric standard model, which has no µ term and conserves baryon number and
lepton number separately and automatically. We consider in detail the scalar sector
as well as the extra ZX gauge boson, and their interactions with the necessary extra
color-triplet particles of this model, which behave as leptoquarks. We show how the
diphoton excess at 750 GeV, recently observed at the LHC, may be explained within
this context. We identify a new fermion dark-matter candidate and discuss its proper-
ties. An important byproduct of this study is the discovery of relaxed supersymmetric
constraints on the Higgs boson’s mass of 125 GeV.

1

Introduction

Since the recent announcements [1, 2] by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the Large

Hadron Collider (LHC) of a diphoton excess around 750 GeV, numerous papers [3] have

appeared explaining its presence or discussing its implications. In this paper, we study the

phenomenology of a model proposed in 2002 [4], which has exactly all the necessary and

suﬃcient particles and interactions for this purpose. They were of course there for solving

other issues in particle physics. However, the observed diphoton excess may well be a ﬁrst

revelation [5] of this model, including its connection to dark matter.

This 2002 model extends the supersymmetric standard model by a new U (1)X gauge

symmetry. It replaces the µ term with a singlet scalar superﬁeld which also couples to heavy

color-triplet superﬁelds which are electroweak singlets. The latter are not ad hoc inventions,

but are necessary for the cancellation of axial-vector anomalies. It was shown in Ref. [4] how

this was accomplished by the remarkable exact factorization of the sum of eleven cubic terms,

resulting in two generic classes of solutions [6]. Both are able to enforce the conservation of

baryon number and lepton number up to dimension-ﬁve terms. As such, the scalar singlet

and the vectorlike quarks are indispensible ingredients of this 2002 model. They are thus

naturally suited for explaining the observed diphoton excess. In 2010 [7], a speciﬁc version

was discussed, which will be the subject of this paper as well. An important byproduct of

this study is the discovery of relaxed supersymmetric constraints on the Higgs boson’s mass

of 125 GeV. This is independent of whether the diphoton excess is conﬁrmed or not.

2 Model

Consider the gauge group SU (3)C × SU (2)L × U (1)Y × U (1)X with the particle content of

Ref. [4]. For n1 = 0 and n4 = 1/3 in Solution (A), the various superﬁelds transform as shown

2

in Table 1. There are three copies of Q, uc, dc, L, ec, N c, S1, S2; two copies of U, U c, S3; and

one copy of φ1, φ2, D, Dc. The only allowed terms of the superpotential are thus trilinear,

The absence of any bilinear term means that all masses come from soft supersymmetry

breaking, thus explaining why the U (1)X and electroweak symmetry breaking scales are

not far from that of supersymmetry breaking. As S1,2,3 acquire nonzero vacuum expectation
values (VEVs), the exotic (U, U c) and (D, Dc) fermions obtain Dirac masses from (cid:104)S3(cid:105), which
also generates the µ term. The singlet N c fermion gets a large Majorana mass from (cid:104)S1(cid:105), so

3

that the neutrino ν gets a small seesaw mass in the usual way. The singlet S1,2,3 fermions
themselves get Majorana masses from their scalar counterparts (cid:104)S1,2,3(cid:105) through the S1S2S3

terms. The only massless ﬁelds left are the usual quarks and leptons. They then become

massive as φ0

1,2 acquire VEVs, as in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM).
Because of U (1)X, the structure of the superpotential conserves both B and (−1)L, with
B = 1/3 for Q, U, D, and B = −1/3 for uc, dc, U c, Dc; (−1)L odd for L, ec, N c, U, U c, D, Dc,
and even for all others. Hence the exotic U, U c, D, Dc scalars are leptoquarks and decay into

ordinary quarks and leptons. The R parity of the MSSM is deﬁned here in the same way,
i.e. R ≡ (−)2j+3B+L, and is conserved. Note also that the quadrilinear terms QQQL and
ucucdcec (allowed in the MSSM) as well as ucdcdcN c are forbidden by U (1)X. Proton decay

is thus strongly suppressed. It may proceed through the quintilinear term QQQLS1 as the

S1 ﬁelds acquire VEVs, but this is a dimension-six term in the eﬀective Lagrangian, which

is suppressed by two powers of a very large mass, say the Planck mass, and may safely be

allowed.

3 Gauge Sector

The new ZX gauge boson of this model becomes massive through (cid:104)S1,2,3(cid:105) = u1,2,3, whereas
1,2(cid:105) = v1,2 contribute to both Z and ZX. The resulting 2× 2 mass-squared matrix is given

Since precision electroweak measurements require Z−ZX mixing to be very small [9], v1 = v2,

i.e. tan β = 1, is preferred. With the 2012 discovery [10, 11] of the 125 GeV particle, and

identiﬁed as the one Higgs boson h responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking, tan β = 1

is not compatible with the MSSM, but is perfectly consistent here, as shown already in Ref. [7]

To estimate B(Z(cid:48) → l−l+), we assume ZX decays to all SM quarks and leptons with eﬀective

zero mass, all the scalar leptons with eﬀective mass of 500 GeV, all the scalar quarks with

eﬀective mass of 800 GeV, the exotic U, D fermions with eﬀective mass of 400 GeV (needed

to explain the diphoton excess), and one pseudo-Dirac fermion from combining ˜S1,2 (the dark
matter candidate to be discussed) with mass of 200 GeV. We ﬁnd B(Z(cid:48) → l−l+) = 0.04, and

for gX = 0.53, a lower bound of 2.85 TeV on mZX is obtained from the LHC data based on

the 7 and 8 TeV runs.

where tan β = v2/v1. For v1 = v2 as in this model, mh would be zero. There is of course the

important radiative correction from Eq. (14), but that alone will not reach 125 GeV. Hence

the MSSM requires both large tan β and large radiative correction, but a signiﬁcant tension

remains in accommodating all data. In this model, as Eq. (23) shows, m2

where v = 123 GeV. This is a very interesting and important result, allowing the Higgs boson

mass to be determined by the gauge U (1)X coupling gX in addition to the Yukawa coupling

f which replaces the µ parameter, i.e. µ = f u3. There is no tension between mh = 125
GeV and the superparticle mass spectrum. Since λ2 (cid:39) 0.25 for ˜mt (cid:39) 1 TeV, we have the

important constraint

(cid:113)

X + 2f 2 (cid:39) 0.885.

For illustration, we have already chosen gX = 0.53. Hence f = 0.5 and for u3 = 2 TeV,

f u3 = 1 TeV is the value of the µ parameter of the MSSM. Let us choose u2 = 4 TeV, then

mZX = 2.87 TeV, which is slightly above the present experimental lower bound of 2.85 TeV

using gX = 0.53 discussed earlier.

As for the heavy Higgs doublet, the four components (H±, H, A) are all degenerate in

mass, i.e. m2 (cid:39) (4f 2 − 2g2

In the S1,2,3 sector, the three physical scalars are mixtures of all three Re(Si) components,

9

whereas the physical pseudoscalar A12 has no Im(S3) component. Since only S3 couples to

U U c, DDc, and φ1φ2, a candidate for the 750 GeV diphoton resonance must have an S3

component. It could be one of the three scalars or the pseudoscalar AS, or the other S3

without VEV. In the following, we will consider the last option, speciﬁcally a pseudoscalar

χ with a signiﬁcant component of this other S3. This allows the χU U c, χDDc and χφ1φ2

couplings to be independent of the masses of U , D, and the charged higgsino. The other

scalars and pseudoscalars are assumed to be much heavier, and yet to be discovered.

6 Diphoton Excess

In this model, other than the addition of N c for seesaw neutrino masses, the only new

particles are U, U c, D, Dc and S1,2,3, which are exactly the ingredients needed to explain the

diphoton excess at the LHC. The allowed S3U U c and S3DDc couplings enable the one-loop

gluon production of S3 in analogy to that of h. The one-loop decay of S3 to two photons

comes from these couplings as well as S3φ1φ2. In addition, the direct S1S2S3 couplings enable

the decay of S3 to other ﬁnal states, including those of the dark sector, which contribute

to its total width. The fact that the exotic U, U c, D, Dc scalars are leptoquarks is also very

useful for understanding [15] other possible LHC ﬂavor anomalies. In a nutshell, a desirable

comprehensive picture of possible new physics beyond the standard model is encapsulated

by this existing model. In the following, we assume that the pseudoscalar χ is the 750 GeV

particle, and show how its production and decay are consistent with the present data.

The production cross section through gluon fusion is given by

where ψ = U, U, D, φ± and Nψ is the number of copies of ψ. Using f 2
φ/4π = 0.21 as well,
λγ = 0.069 TeV−1 is obtained. We then have Γ(χ → γγ) = 10 MeV and Γ(χ → gg) = 4.0
GeV. If B(χ → γγ) = 2.5× 10−4, then σ = 6 fb, and the total width of χ is 40 GeV, in good

agreement with data [1, 2].

As mentioned earlier, there are 2 copies of S3 and 3 copies each of S1,2. In addition to the
ones with VEVs in their scalar components, there are 5 other superﬁelds. One pair ˜S1,2 may

form a pseudo-Dirac fermion, and be the lightest particle with odd R parity. It will couple to

χ, say with strength fS which is independent of all other couplings that we have discussed,
then the tree-level decay χ → ˜S1

˜S2 dominates the total width of χ and is invisible.

For mχ = 750 GeV and mS = 200 GeV, we ﬁnd Γ = 36 GeV if fS = 1.2. These numbers

reinforce our numerical analysis to support the claim that χ is a possible candidate for the

750 GeV diphoton excess. Note also that λg and λγ have scalar contributions which we

have not considered. Adding them will allow us to reduce the fermion contributions we have

assumed and still get the same ﬁnal reuslts.

If we disregard the decay to dark matter (fS = 0), then the total width of χ is dominated
by Γ(χ → gg), which is then less than a GeV. Assuming that the cross section for the
diphoton resonance is 6.2 ± 1 fb [16], we plot the allowed values of f 2

Q/4π versus mQ for

both fS = 1.2 which gives a total width of about 40 GeV for χ, and fS = 0 which requires

much smaller values of f 2
exclusion upper limits (∼ 2 pb) from the 8 TeV data in each case as well.

In the MSSM, ˜ν is ruled out as a dark-matter candidate because it interacts elastically with

nuclei through the Z boson. Here, the AN term allows a mass splitting between the real and

imaginary parts of the scalar ﬁelds, and avoids this elastic-scattering constraint by virtue of

kinematics. However, we still assume their masses to be heavier than that of ˜S1,2, discussed

in the previous section.

In the neutralino sector, in addition to the 4 × 4 mass matrix of the MSSM spanning

( ˜B, ˜W3, ˜φ0

1, ˜φ0

there is also the 4 × 4 mass matrix spanning ( ˜X, ˜S3, ˜S2, ˜S1), i.e.

These neutral fermions are odd under R parity and the lightest could in principle be a dark-

matter candidate. To avoid the stringent bounds on dark matter with the MSSM alone, we

14

assume again that all these particles are heavier than ˜S1,2, as the dark matter discussed in

the previous section.

8 Dark Matter

The 5 × 5 mass matrix spanning the 5 singlet fermions ( ˜S1, ˜S2, ˜S1, ˜S2, ˜S3), corresponding to

superﬁelds with zero VEV for their scalar components, is given by

(54)

Note that the 4 × 4 submatrix spanning ( ˜S1, ˜S2, ˜S1, ˜S2) has been diagonalized to form two

Dirac fermions. We can choose m0 to be small, say 200 GeV, and M1,2,3 to be large, of order

TeV. However, because of the mixing terms m13, m23, the light Dirac fermion gets split into

two Majorana fermions, so it should be called a pseudo-Dirac fermion.

The dark matter with odd R parity is the lighter of the two Majorana fermions, call it ˜S,

contained in the pseudo-Dirac fermion formed out of ˜S1,2 as discussed in Sec. 6. It couples

to the ZX gauge boson, but in the nonrelativistic limit, its elastic scattering cross section

with nuclei through ZX vanishes because it is Majorana. It also does not couple directly to

the Higgs boson h, so its direct detection at underground search experiments is very much

suppressed. However, it does couple to AS which couples also to quarks through the very

small mixing of AS with A. This is further suppressed because it contributes only to the

spin-dependent cross section. To obtain a spin-independent cross section at tree level, the

constraint of Eqs. (17) to (19) have to be relaxed so that h mixes with S1,2,3.

Let the coupling of h to ˜S ˜S be , then the eﬀective interaction for elastic scattering of ˜S

We have already invoked the χ ˜S1

˜S2 coupling to obtain a large invisible width for χ.
Consider now the fermion counterpart of χ, call it ˜S(cid:48), and the scalar counterparts of ˜S1,2,
then the couplings ˜S(cid:48) ˜S1S2 and ˜S(cid:48) ˜S2S1 are also fS = 1.2. Suppose one linear combination of

S1,2 , call it ζ, is lighter than 200 GeV, then the thermal relic abundance of dark matter is
determined by the annihilation ˜S ˜S → ζζ, with a cross section times relative velocity given

by

TeV, mS = 200 GeV, and mζ = 150 GeV. Note that ζ stays in thermal equilibrium through

its interaction with h from a term in VD. It is also very diﬃcult to be produced at the LHC,

because it is an SM singlet, so its mass of 150 GeV is allowed.

9 Conclusion

The utilitarian supersymmetric U (1)X gauge extension of the Standard Model of particle

interactions proposed 14 years ago [4] allows for two classes of anomaly-free models which

have no µ term and conserve baryon number and lepton number automatically. A simple

version [7] with leptoquark superﬁelds is especially interesting because of existing LHC ﬂavor

anomalies.

The new ZX gauge boson of this model has speciﬁed couplings to quarks and leptons

which are distinct from other gauge extensions and may be tested at the LHC. On the other

hand, a hint may already be discovered with the recent announcements by ATLAS and CMS

of a diphoton excess at around 750 GeV. It may well be the revelation of the singlet scalar

(or pseudoscalar) S3 predicted by this model which also predicts that there should be singlet

leptoquarks and other particles that S3 must couple to. Consequently, gluon fusion will

produce S3 which will then decay to two photons together with other particles, including

those of the dark sector. This scenario explains the observed diphoton excess, all within the

context of the original model, and not an invention after the fact.

Since S3 couples to leptoquarks, the S3 → l+
i l

−
j decay must occur at some level. As such,
S3 → e+µ− would be a very distinct signature at the LHC. Its branching fraction depends

on unknown Yukawa couplings which need not be very small. Similarly, the S3 couplings to

φ1φ2 as well as leptoquarks imply decays to ZZ and Zγ with rates comparable to γγ.

straints on the Higgs boson’s mass of 125 GeV. It is now given by Eq. (23), i.e. m2

An important byproduct of this study is the discovery of relaxed supersymmetric con-
h (cid:39)
X + 2f 2 + λ2)v2, which allows it to be free of the tension encountered in the MSSM. This

(g2

prediction is independent of whether the diphoton excess is conﬁrmed or not.

Most importantly, since S3 replaces the µ parameter, its identiﬁcation with the 750 GeV

17

excess implies the existence of supersymmetry. If conﬁrmed and supported by subsequent

data, it may even be considered in retrospect as the ﬁrst evidence for the long-sought exis-

tence of supersymmetry.
