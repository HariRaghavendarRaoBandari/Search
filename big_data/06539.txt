The index of shrinkers of the mean curvature ﬂow

Zihan Hans Liu

Abstract

We introduce a notion of index for shrinkers of the mean curvature
ﬂow. We then prove a gap theorem for the index of rotationally symmetric
immersed shrinkers in R3, namely, that such shrinkers have index at least
3, unless they are one of the stable ones: the sphere, the cylinder, or the
plane. We also provide a generalization of the result to higher dimensions.

1 Introduction

Self-similar shrinkers of the mean curvature ﬂow are submanifolds of Rn+1 which
satisfy the equation

~H +

x⊥ = 0.

1
2

They arise naturally as tangent ﬂows at singularities of the mean curvature ﬂow:
If the spacetime point (x0, t0) is a singularity of a mean curvature ﬂow, then
(subsequential) limits of parabolic rescalings of the ﬂow around this point will
converge to a shrinker; see [Hui90] and [Ilm95]. For this reason, the stability
(or instability) of those singularities is related to the stability of shrinkers.

Self-shrinkers are stationary with respect to the Gaussian integral

F0,1(Σ) = (4π)−n/2ZΣ

e−|x|2/4,

and in fact, by Huisken’s monotonicity formula [Hui90], this integral is non-
increasing under a rescaled version of mean curvature ﬂow.

If one na¨ıvely considers stability with respect to this functional, all shrinkers
turn out to be unstable. Indeed, if Σs is a one-parameter family of translations
or dilations of Σ, with Σ0 = Σ, then s 7→ F (Σs) has a local maximum at s = 0;
see [CM12] or [Rig96]. But our real interest is in the stability of mean curvature
ﬂow singularity, for which the shrinker is a blow-up limit.
In that context,
translations and dilations of the shrinker correspond to moving the singularity
around in space and time without changing its shape. As such, they do not
represent true instabilities of the singularity.

Instead, in [CM12], Colding and Minicozzi introduce an entropy functional,
obtained by taking the supremum of the F -functional centered at diﬀerent
scales. This entropy is monotonically decreasing under the mean curvature
ﬂow. Based on this, they introduce the notion of entropy-stability for shrinkers,

1

which better captures what it means for the corresponding singularity to be sta-
ble. They then show that the only entropy-stable self-shrinking hypersurfaces
are the sphere, the cylinders, and the plane.

To do so, they deﬁne a diﬀerent stability notion for shrinkers, which they
call F -stability. Essentially, this is the same as linear stability of the shrinker
with respect to the F -functional, except that one “quotients out” by the linear
subspace generated by translations and dilatations of the shrinker. Colding and
Minicozzi show that entropy-stability and F -stability are closely related, and in
fact equivalent except when the shrinker is the isometric product of a line with
a lower-dimensional submanifold.

In this work, we introduce the notions of entropy index and F -index of a
shrinker. Simply put, these count the number of linearly independent varia-
tions that demonstrate entropy-instability and F -instability in Colding’s and
Minicozzi’s sense. A more precise deﬁnition of F -index will be given as Deﬁni-
tion 2.13, and a more precise deﬁnition of entropy index as Deﬁnition 5.7. We
will ﬁrst prove results for the F -index, and then in Section 5.4, we will relate
these results to the entropy index.

This work focuses on smooth self-shrinking hypersurfaces with a rotational
symmetry. The results are easiest to state in dimension 3, where we can give
the following as a special case of corollaries to our main theorem:

Theorem 1.1. Let Σ2 be an immersed, oriented shrinker with polynomial vol-
ume growth. Suppose that it is rotationally symmetric, but not isometric to the
sphere, the cylinder, or the plane. Then it has F -index and entropy index at
least 3.

The main theorem itself is valid in any dimension, and we will only need one
degree of rotational symmetry. The price is that we need to assume an extra
geometric condition:
Theorem 1.2. Let Σn ⊆ Rn+1 be an immersed, oriented shrinker with polyno-
mial volume growth, and assume that Σ is invariant under a subgroup SO(2) ⊂
SO(n + 1) of rotations of the ambient Rn+1. Assume that er · n takes on both
positive and negative values on Σ, where n is the unit normal to Σ, and er is
the vector ﬁeld in Rn+1 consisting of unit vector pointing away from the “rota-
tional axis”, i.e. the ﬁxed-point set of the symmetry group SO(2). Then Σ has
F -index at least 3.

The additional geometric condition can be understood as ruling out im-
mersed shrinkers which are locally “radial graphs” over the ﬁxed-point set of
the SO(2).
If we have a full SO(n) worth of rotational symmetry, then this
condition automatically holds:
Corollary 1.3. Let Σn ⊆ Rn+1 be an immersed, oriented shrinker with poly-
nomial volume growth. Assume that Σ is invariant under a subgroup SO(n) ⊂
SO(n + 1) of the rotations of the ambient Rn+1, and that Σ is not isometric

to either the plane, the cylinder Sn−1(p2(n − 1)) × R, or the sphere Sn(√2n).

Then Σ has F -index at least 3.

2

Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.3 only give results for the F -index. With a
little more work, it will follow that the shrinkers we consider also have entropy
index at least 3:

Corollary 1.4. Suppose that Σ is a shrinker which satisﬁes the hypotheses of
either Theorem 1.2 or Corollary 1.3. Then Σ has entropy index at least 3.

Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.3 will be proved in section 5.3, Corollary 1.4
will be proved in section 5.4. Theorem 1.1 is just the special case n = 2 in
Corollaries 1.3 and 1.4.

In terms of a “generic mean curvature ﬂow” suggested in [CM12] (see also
[CMP15]), this means that singularities corresponding to those shrinkers are
expected to be easier to “perturb away.” That is, it should be possible to
do so even if one adds up to two dimensions worth of restrictions on what
perturbations are permissible. Note, however, that the results here only concern
stability in a linearized sense; more work is needed to turn this into a statement
about the dynamical stability of singularities of the nonlinear mean curvature
ﬂow.

There are many examples of shrinkers satisfying the hypotheses of Corol-
lary 1.3. The earliest rigorously constructed ones are the “Angenent tori”,
embedded surfaces diﬀeomorphic to S1 × Sn−1, found in [Ang92]. In that work,
Angenent also gives numerical examples for several other immersed shrinkers
with the same rotational symmetry. In [DK13], Drugan and Kleene construct
inﬁnitely many immersed shrinkers in Rn+1 with an SO(n) rotational sym-
metry, and in [Dru15], Drugan constructs a non-embedded rotationally sym-
metric shrinker homeomorphic to S2 (diﬀerent from the numerical examples
of Angenent). More recently, in [McG15], McGrath constructs embedded self-
shrinkers in R2n with an SO(n) × SO(n) symmetry. Corollary 1.3 and Corol-
lary 1.4 apply to all of the above examples, and show that they have entropy
index at least 3.

In [KM14], Møller and Kleene studied shrinkers satisfying the symmetry
condition in Corollary 1.3, and classify the embedded ones. In fact, the proof
of Corollary 1.3 will be based on this classiﬁcation.

The main idea behind the proof of Theorem 1.2 is the following simple obser-
vation: Under the SO(2) symmetry hypothesis, the stability operator L turns
out to be a separable partial diﬀerential operator. We can ﬁnd a complete set
of eigenfunctions of the form ueikθ, where θ is the angular variable, and u is
independent of θ. This way, we divide the spectrum of L into parts correspond-
ing to diﬀerent values of k, and analyze these “restricted spectra” separately.
All shrinkers have certain eigenfunctions in the k = 0 and k = 1 parts, and
when these change sign, we can construct unstable variations in both of the
corresponding subspaces.

When Σ is compact and does not intersect the ﬁxed-point set of the SO(2)
symmetry group, the above outline easily translates into a complete proof.
When Σ is non-compact, or when Σ contains ﬁxed points of the SO(2), there
are more technical diﬃculties to overcome, a task which takes up the bulk of
this paper.

The results in the paper can be compared [Urb90], in which Urbano shows
that the index of a minimal surface in S3 is at least ﬁve, unless it is totally
geodesic, with equality only for the Cliﬀord torus.

2 Self-shrinkers

2.1 Deﬁnition and notation

Deﬁnition 2.1. A shrinker is a smooth, complete, immersed hypersurface Σn
in Rn+1 whose mean curvature vector satisﬁes ~H + 1
2 x⊥ = 0, where x is the
position vector in Rn+1, and ⊥ denotes orthogonal projection onto the normal
bundle of Σ. Furthermore, we require that Σ have polynomial volume growth,
i.e. that voln(Σ ∩ BR(0)) ≤ p(R) for some polynomial p (which may depend
on Σ).

Remark 2.2. In general, one can also consider shrinkers with higher codimen-
sion. However, less is known about the stability of these (see e.g. [ALW14] and
[LL15]), and we will assume that all of our shrinkers have codimension 1.

Remark 2.3. In this work, we only consider shrinkers with polynomial vol-
ume growth.
In practice, this is not very restrictive. For example, Colding
and Minicozzi show that any time slice of limit ﬂow of a mean curvature ﬂow
starting from a smooth, closed, embedded hypersurface has polynomial (in fact
Euclidean) volume growth; see Corollary 2.13 in [CM12]. Furthermore, Ding
and Xin ([DX13]) have shown that any properly immersed hypersurface satis-
fying the shrinker equation has Euclidean volume growth.

Remark 2.4. All the results in this paper apply to both immersed and em-
bedded shrinkers. However, in terms of notation, we will often pretend that
Σ is embedded. For example, we may write Σ ∩ BR(0) in a situation where
i−1(BR(0)) would be more correct, with i : Σ → Rn+1 being the immersion
map. This will not alter the substance of the statements made; it will always
be possible to translate them into the more cumbersome but technically correct
notation.
Deﬁnition 2.5. If x0 ∈ Rn+1 and t0 ∈ R, we use Fx0,t0 to denote the F -
functional centered at x0 with timescale t0. It is deﬁned by

Fx0,t0(Σ) = (4πt0)−n/2ZΣ

e−|x−x0|2/(4t0)d voln .

Here, Σ is any immersed hypersurface in Rn+1.

Remark 2.6. Self-shrinkers are precisely the stationary points of the func-
tional F0,1. In fact, more is true: a suitably rescaled version of mean curvature
ﬂow is actually the negative gradient ﬂow for the F -functional. For more details,
see e.g. [Hui90].

Colding and Minicozzi also deﬁne the entropy of a hypersurface:

4

Deﬁnition 2.7. Suppose that Σ is an immersed hypersurface in Rn+1. Then
its entropy is

λ(Σ) =

sup

Fx0,t0(Σ).

x0∈Rn+1,t0>0

As a consequence of Huisken’s monotonicity formula ([Hui90]), the entropy is
non-increasing under mean curvature ﬂow. In particular, a mean curvature ﬂow
starting from a hypersurface of a certain entropy cannot develop singularities
represented by shrinkers of higher entropy.

A shrinker can be seen as a minimal surface in the weighted manifold
(Rn+1, e−|x|2/4d voln+1). It will be convenient to view the shrinker itself as a
weighted manifold with the same weight, and use special notation for weighted
integrals:

Notation.

• We will use the following notation for weighted integrals:

[f ]D = (4π)−n/2ZD

f e−|x|2/4d voln ,

where D is a subset of Σ (possibly Σ itself) and f is a function on D.

• L2

w(D) will denote the corresponding weighted L2-space, i.e. the comple-

tion of C∞

c (D) with respect to the norm given by kfk2 = [f 2]D.

• If D is open and bounded, we will also use H 1

0,w(D) to denote the com-
c (D) with respect to the weighted H 1-norm given by kfk2 =

pletion of C∞
[|∇f|2 + f 2]D.

• L will denote the corresponding drift Laplacian, deﬁned by

Lf = ∆Σf −

1
2

xT · ∇f ,

for f a function on Σ. Here, (·)T denotes orthogonal projection onto the
tangent space of Σ, and · denotes the inner product in Rn+1.

The operator L is formally self-adjoint with respect to a weighted inner

product:
Proposition 2.8. Suppose that f, g ∈ C∞
hypersurface in Rn+1. Then [−fLg]Σ = [∇f · ∇g]Σ = [−gLf ]Σ.
Proof. This is a simple consequence of the divergence theorem, using the fact
that ∇e−|x|2/4 = − 1

c (Σ), where Σ is a complete immersed

2 xT e−|x|2/4.

2.2 Second variation and F -stability

In studying the stability of shrinkers, Colding and Minicozzi introduced the
notion of F -stability. We will repeat the essentials of this deﬁnition below,
for easy reference. We will also deﬁne the F -index, which, roughly speaking,
is the dimension of the space of unstable variations, modulo translations and
dilatations

Since the rescaled mean curvature is a negative gradient ﬂow for the F -
functional, stability of shrinkers should be related to the second variation of
this functional. We will begin by stating the second variation formula.
Deﬁnition 2.9. Suppose that is : Σ → Rn+1 is a family of immersions of a
hypersurface. We say that is is a variation of the immersed hypersurface i0(Σ).
The variation vector ﬁeld X is given by X = ∂is/∂s|s=0.
If we can write
X = f n, where f is a scalar function on Σ and n is the unit normal to i0(Σ),
then we call f the corresponding variation function.

Remark 2.10. We will often use the notation Σs = is(Σ) for the variation, and
ignore the questions of how the hypersurface Σs is parametrized. It will then be
understood that we make the parametrization in such a way that the variation
vector ﬁeld is normal to Σ0, something which can always be achieved. The
properties we study will be independent of parametrization, so this represents
no loss of generality.

Proposition 2.11. Let Σ be an immersed shrinker of polynomial volume growth.
Suppose that Σs is a compactly supported variation of Σ with variation func-
tion f , and that xs ∈ Rn+1 and ts ∈ R+ are smooth variations around x0 = 0
and t0 = 1, where d

ds xs|s=0 = y, d

ds ts|s=0 = h. Then

Fxs,ts(Σs) = (cid:20)−f Lf + 2f hH − h2H 2 + f y · n −

Here, the stability operator L, acting on functions on Σ, is given by

n denotes the normal vector to Σ; and · denotes the inner product in Rn+1.
Proof. See Theorem 4.14 in [CM12].

It turns out that the stability operator L always has certain negative eigen-
values (here and in the rest of the article, we will use the convention that λ is
an eigenvalue for L if Lu + λu = 0 for some function u).

Proposition 2.12. Let Σ be an oriented shrinker in Rn+1, let H denote its
mean curvature, and let n denote its (consistently oriented) unit normal. Then

(ii) L(y · n) = 1

2 y · n, for any ﬁxed vector y ∈ Rn+1.

These variations correspond to translating and scaling the shrinker. Do-
ing so does lower the value of the F -functional. However, as mentioned in the
introduction, these variations correspond to just moving a singularity around,
so we do not want to consider them true instabilities. A better stability deﬁni-
tion, Colding and Minicozzi’s F -stability from [CM12], “quotients out” by these
variations.
Deﬁnition 2.13. Let Σn ⊂ Rn+1 be an immersed shrinker of polynomial vol-
ume growth.

(i) Let Σs be a compactly supported variation of Σ = Σ0 with variation func-
tion f . We say that the variation is stable if there exists some variations
xs ∈ Rn+1, ts ∈ R with xs = 0, ts = 1 such that

otherwise we say it is unstable.

d2

ds2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s=0

Fxs,ts(Σs) ≥ 0;

From Proposition 2.11 we see that this property only depends on the vari-
ation function f , so we will also say that f is stable or unstable.

(ii) Σ is F -stable if every compactly supported variation is stable. Otherwise

it is F -unstable.

(iii) The F -index of Σ is the maximal dimension of a linear subspace consisting

entirely of compactly supported unstable variation functions.

Remark 2.14. With these deﬁnitions, being F -stable is equivalent to having
F -index 0.

3 Rotationally symmetric shrinkers

3.1 Deﬁnition and notation
Fix a one-parameter subgroup G ≃ SO(2) of SO(n + 1), the group of rotations
of Rn+1.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let S be any subset of Rn+1. We say that S is rotationally
symmetric if it is invariant under G.

If Σ is an immersed hypersurface in Rn+1, we say that Σ is rotationally

symmetric if its image is rotationally symmetric as a subset of Rn+1.

Notation.

• Q will denote the quotient Rn+1/G. We will identify Q with a half-

space Rn−1 × R≥0.

• A will denote the ﬁxed-point set of Rn+1 under the action of G, i.e. A =
{x ∈ Rn+1 | gx = x ∀g ∈ G}. We will sometimes call this the symmetry
axis.

• (x1, . . . , xn+1) will be used as Cartesian coordinates on Rn+1. These are
arranged so that G acts by changing only xn and xn+1. x will denote the
position vector on Rn+1.

• (x1, . . . , xn−1; r, θ) will be used as cylindrical coordinates on Rn+1, deﬁned

by xn = r cos θ and xn+1 = r sin θ. Thus, for example, A = {r = 0}.

• (x′

1, . . . , x′

n) will be used as coordinates on Q = Rn−1 × R≥0. Sometimes
n, to emphasize the connections with the cylindrical

we will write r = x′
coordinates on Rn+1. x′ will denote the position vector in Q.

• Σ′ will denote the image of Σ in Q, assuming that Σ is rotationally sym-
metric. Similarly, if S is any rotationally symmetric subset of Rn+1, then
S′ will denote its image in Q.

In studying a rotationally symmetric shrinker Σ, it will be helpful to pass to

the quotient Σ′. We will establish some basic properties of this quotient.

An immersed submanifold will be called connected if the domain of the
immersion is connected, i.e. if it cannot be decomposed non-trivially as two
immersed submanifolds.

Lemma 3.2. Suppose that Σ is a smooth, complete, connected and rotationally
symmetric immersed hypersurface in Rn+1. Then Σ′ is a smooth immersed
hypersurface-with-boundary in Q, whose boundary lies on ∂Q. Furthermore, the
interior of Σ′ is connected.
Proof. Let i : Σ → Rn+1 denote the immersion and let H be some hyperplane
in Rn+1 containing A. Note that i(Σ) cannot be tangent to H anywhere; if
it were, then, by rotational symmetry, the image of i would contain an open
subset of Rn+1 b, contradicting Sard’s theorem. It follows that i intersects H
transversely, and thus i(Σ) ∩ H is a smooth, complete, immersed hypersurface
in H.
Since Σ′ can be viewed as the intersection of i(Σ) with one half of H, it
follows that Σ′ is (the image of) a smooth, immersed hypersurface in Q, with
boundary lying in ∂Q.

It remains to show that the interior of Σ′ is connected. First, we will show
that i also intersects A transversely. Suppose not. Then there must be a point
x ∈ i−1(A) where i∗(TxΣ) is hyperplane H containing A. This leads to a
contradiction by the same reasoning as in the ﬁrst paragraph. Thus, i−1(A) is
a submanifold of codimension two in Σ.

Since Σ is connected, Σ \ i−1(A) is connected too, so any two points p, q ∈
Σ\ i−1(A) can be joined by a path which avoids i−1(A). Since this path can be
pushed down to Σ′, this shows that Σ′ \ ∂Σ′ is connected as well.

As with L, this operator is formally self-adjoint:

Proposition 3.3. Let Σ′ be an immersed hypersurface in Q with ∂Σ′ ⊂ ∂Q.
Suppose that f, g ∈ C∞
c (Σ′) (where we allow the possibility that f and g are
non-zero on ∂Σ′). Then [−fL′g]′

f (x) = u(x′) cos(kθ), and
f (x) = u(x′) sin(kθ),

where u is a function on Σ′ only. We will introduce some spaces of functions of

Remark 3.4. Because of the rotational symmetry, the spaces deﬁned using
the sines behave in the same way as the ones using cosines. We will focus on
the latter, with the tacit understanding that corresponding results hold for the
former as well.

Given a function f on Σ, we can decompose it as a Fourier series:

Proposition 3.5. Let Σ be a rotationally symmetric immersed hypersurface
in Rn+1, and let D be a rotationally symmetric subset of Σ. Then we can

The fact that the decomposition is orthogonal simply follows from the or-
thogonality of the basis functions cos(kθ) and sin(lθ) in L2(S1). For example,
suppose that f = u(x′) cos(kθ) and g = v(x′) cos(lθ), with k 6= l. Then

By adding (5) and (6), and integrating with respect to x′ (with weight

(ii) This follows from part (i) by an approximation argument.

Due to smoothness, functions in C∞(k, D) are restricted in their possible
behavior near the symmetry axis A = {r = 0}, as the following lemma shows.
This will be useful later in dealing boundary terms at A.

Lemma 3.7. Suppose that Σ′ is a rotationally symmetric, smooth, immersed
hypersurface in Rn+1. Take a function f ∈ C∞(k, D), and write f = u(x′) cos(kθ).
Let p′ ∈ ∂Σ′, and let X ′ ∈ Tp′Σ′ be the unit normal to ∂Σ′.
(i) If k 6= 1, then X ′ · ∇u vanishes at p′.
(ii) If k ≥ 1, then u = 0 at p′.
Proof.
(i) Let p ∈ A ⊆ Rn+1 denote the unique preimage of p′ under the quotient
map Rn+1 → Q. Given an angle φ, let Xφ ∈ TpΣ denote the unit vector
pointing in the direction given by θ = φ. Then

Xφ · ∇f = cos(kθ)X ′ · ∇u.

(7)

When k ≥ 2, let φj = 2πj/k for 1 ≤ j ≤ k. We note that cos(kφj ) = 1 for
all j, and that Pk
j=1 Xφj = 0. Therefore, we obtain the desired result by
taking the sum of k instances of (7) for these values of φ.

When k = 0, any angle φ has cos(kφ) = 1, so we can get the same result
by taking the same sum with, for example, X0 and Xπ.

(ii) If k ≥ 1, then the function cos(kθ) takes the value 0 for some θ.

In
other words, f vanishes on certain half-spaces with boundary A, and by
continuity must vanish on Σ ∩ A as well.

3.3 Stability operator

It turns out that the stability operator L maps the subsets C∞(k, Σ) into them-
selves. This will be a key point in the analysis of the spectrum of L.

Proposition 3.8. Suppose that Σ is a rotationally symmetric shrinker, and
that f ∈ C∞(k, Σ), with f (x) = u(x′) cos(kθ). Then

Lf = Lku cos(kθ)

where the operator Lk, acting on functions on Σ′, is given by

Lku = L′u +(cid:18)|A|2 +

where ⊥ denotes orthogonal projection onto the normal bundle of Σ′.

In particular, if f ∈ C∞(k, Σ), then Lf ∈ C∞(k, Σ).

Proof. We can view f as a function f (x′, θ) on Σ′ × S1. The result will follow
from the following three identities:
(i) xT · ∇Σf = (x′)T · ∇Σ′
(ii) |AΣ|2 = |AΣ′|2 + r−2(cid:12)(cid:12)e⊥

f .

To establish some notation, pick an arbitrary point x ∈ Σ. Thinking of Σ as
Σ′ × S1 (with a warped metric), we write x = (x′, θ), and let Σ′
x = Σ′ ×{θ} and
Γ = {x′}× S1 denote the copies of Σ′ and S1, respectively, that pass through x.
We will think of these as submanifolds of Σ, and hence immersed submanifolds
of Rn+1; Γ is then just a circle around A and Σ′
x an isometric copy of Σ′ which
is contained in a half-space with boundary A.
We will show identities (i) to (iii) in turn:

(i) This is immediate, the key point being that the position vector x does not

have any component in the θ-direction.

(ii) Consider the unit vector eθ = 1
r

∂
∂θ . Then eθ, thought of as a vector
X eθ)⊥ =
x is totally

in Rn+1, depends only on θ, and it follows that AΣ(eθ, X) = (∇Rn+1
0 for any vector X ∈ TpΣ′
x. From this, and the fact that Σ′
geodesic in Σ, we conclude that |AΣ|2 = |AΣ′|2 + |AΣ(eθ, eθ)|2.
On the other hand, we can easily calculate AΣ(eθ, eθ) = (∇Rn+1

∆Σu = ∆Σ′

at x, where ~κ is the geodesic curvature of Γ in Σ.

13

The geodesic curvature vector κ of Γ in Σ is just the orthogonal projection
of the curvature vector of Γ in the ambient space Rn+1 onto the tangent
space of Σ. It follows that ~κ = −eT
r /r. Furthermore, on the circle Γ, the
Laplacian is given by∆Γ = 1
r2

∂ 2
∂θ2 , and (iii) follows.

Substituting in the identities (i), (ii), and (iii) into the formula for L, given in
Proposition 2.11, we get the result.

As the above proposition suggests, the known eigenfunctions of L from

Proposition 2.12 ﬁt in well in the framework of C∞(k, Σ) functions:

Proposition 3.9. Suppose that Σ is a rotationally symmetric shrinker with
mean curvature H and normal vector n.

(i) The function H belongs to C∞(0, Σ).
(ii) For i = 1, . . . , n − 1, the functions ei · n also belong to C∞(0, Σ).
(iii) The function en · n belongs to C∞(1, Σ), and the function en+1 · n belongs

to C∞

sin(1, Σ).

Proof. (i) and (ii) are easy consequences of rotational symmetry. To see that
(iii) is true, note that the projection of n onto the xnxn+1-plane is a vector of
magnitude nΣ′ · er and direction parallel to er = en cos θ + en+1 sin θ. In other
words, n · en = (nΣ′ · er) cos θ, and similarly nΣ · en+1 = (nΣ′ · er) sin θ.

4 Spectrum of the stability operator

4.1 Restricted spectra on compact domains

In this section, we will study the spectrum of the operator L. In light of Propo-
sitions 3.5 and 3.8, it is natural to do so by decomposing the spectrum into
separate parts corresponding to each C∞(k, Σ).

We will develop this spectral theory in the compact setting ﬁrst. Let D be

a bounded, rotationally symmetric subdomain of Σ.

Deﬁnition 4.1. By the k-th restricted (Dirichlet) eigenvalue spectrum of L on
D, we mean the set of µ ∈ R for which there exists a nonzero function f ∈
C∞
0 (k, D) such that Lu + µu = 0.
Remark 4.2. If Σ ∩ A = ∅, then the restricted spectrum is just the spectrum
of the operator Lk, and the results of this section are standard consequences of
the spectral theory of self-adjoint elliptic operators.

When Σ does intersect A, we need to work harder. On one hand, the co-
eﬃcients of Lk are unbounded near A, and the standard elliptic theory of Lk
does not immediately give enough control on the behavior of the solutions near
this boundary. On the other hand, functions in C∞(D′) coming from C∞(k, D)
have restrictions on their behavior near ∂Σ′ (see Lemma 3.7), and this will help
us ﬁnish the proof.

14

We will work in a (weighted) Sobolev setting, and it will be convenient to

deﬁne a bilinear form corresponding to L. If f, g ∈ C∞
BL(f, g) = [−f Lg]D =(cid:20)∇f · ∇g −(cid:18)|A|2 +

c (D), we let

1

2(cid:19) f g(cid:21)D

.

In light of the second expression, BL extends to a bounded bilinear form on H 1

0,w(D).

The restricted spectra satisfy all the usual properties we expect from spectra

of second-order elliptic operators:

Theorem 4.3. Fix k, and let D be a rotationally symmetric, bounded, open
subset of the rotationally symmetric shrinker Σ.

(i) The k-th restricted eigenvalue spectrum of L consists of real eigenvalues
µ1 < µ2 ≤ µ3 ≤ ··· , where the corresponding eigenfunctions f1, f2, . . .
form an orthonormal basis for L2

u > 0 in the interior of D′ \ ∂Σ′.

Remark 4.4. For unrestricted spectra, these results are standard; see e.g.
Section 6.5 of [Eva10], where the results are proved in a slightly simpler setting.
The proof here uses the same ideas, with the next lemma being the only new
ingredient. The lemma can be thought of as a weak version of the statement
that L acts on the spaces C∞(k, D).

Lemma 4.5. Let D be a rotationally symmetric, bounded, open subset of the
rotationally symmetric shrinker Σ, and ﬁx an integer k ≥ 0.
(i) Suppose that f ∈ H 1

0,w(k, D) and g ∈ H 1

0,w(D), and let gk denote the L2
w-
w(k, D). Then BL(f, g) =

orthogonal projection of g onto the subspace L2
BL(f, gk).
(ii) Let f ∈ H 1

0,w(k, D) and let α ∈ R. Suppose that the equation

BL(f, h) + α[f h]D = 0

holds for all h ∈ H 1
any g ∈ H 1
0,w(D).

0,w(k, D). Then in fact BL(f, g) + α[f g]D = 0 holds for

15

Proof.

(i) Suppose ﬁrst that f and g are smooth. Proposition 3.8 gives Lf ∈

C∞(k, D), and by orthogonality of the spaces L2

w(k, D), we have

BL(f, g) = −[(Lf )g]D = −[(Lf )gk]D = BL(f, gk),

which is the desired identity.
In the general case, Lemma 3.6 implies that g 7→ gk is continuous as a map
0,w(D) → H 1
H 1
0,w(k, D), and the result follows from a continuity argument.

(ii) Decompose g as g = gk + g′. By part (i), BL(f, g) = BL(f, gk), and by

simple orthogonality α[f g]D = α[f gk]D. Thus

BL(f, g) + α[f g]D = BL(f, gk) + α[f gk]D,

which is zero by assumption.

Proof of Theorem 4.3.
(i) We can pick γ > supD |A|2 + 1

2 and deﬁne Bγ(f, g) = BL(f, g) + [f g]D.
w ≤

0,w(k, D), which satisﬁes kfkH 1

Then Bγ deﬁnes an inner product on H 1
CBγ(f, f ) for some C.
We now deﬁne an operator R : L2
h ∈ L2
space (H 1
Bγ(f, g) = [hg]D for all g ∈ H 1
see that R is bounded.

0,w(k, D) as follows. Let
w(k, D). By the Riesz representation theorem, applied to the Hilbert

0,w(k, D). We then set Rh = f ; it is easy to

0,w(k, D), Bγ), we can ﬁnd a unique f ∈ H 1

w(k, D) → H 1

w(k, D) → L2

By the Rellich-Kondrachov theorem, R is compact when thought of as a
operator L2
w(k, D). It is also self-adjoint and positive deﬁnite,
and it follows that it has a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues λ1 ≥ λ2 ≥
··· > 0, with λi → 0, and with the corresponding eigenfunctions fi forming
an orthonormal basis of L2

w(k, D).

By the deﬁnition of R, the eigenfunctions fi satisfy

Bγ(fi, g) = λ−1

(11)

for all g ∈ H 1
0,w(k, D). By Lemma 4.5(ii), the equation (11) in fact holds
for all g ∈ H 1

λ−1
i fi. By standard elliptic regularity, it follows that the fi are smooth,
and that the relation (L + γ)fi = λ−1
Setting µi = λ−1
which we will leave for later.

i − γ, this proves (i), except for the assertion that µ1 < µ2,

i fi holds in the classical sense.

(ii) On one hand, BL(f1, f1) = µ1, so the inﬁmum is at most µ1.

0,w(k, D), with kfkL2

On the other hand, suppose f ∈ H 1
w(D) = 1. We need
to show that BL(f, f ) ≥ µ1, or equivalently, that Bγ(f, f ) ≥ µ1 + γ = λ−1
1 .
Since the eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis for L2
w(k, D), we can
write f = P∞
w. The coeﬃcients ai

Bγ(f, f ) ≥ PN

i . This holds for all N , so
we conclude that Bγ(f, f ) ≥ µi + γ, which proves (ii).

ds BL(f + sg, f + sg) = 0,
or in other words, BL(f, g) = 0. This proves (12) for g ∈ H 1
0,w(k, D).
By Lemma 4.5(ii), the equation (12) is in fact valid for all g ∈ H 1
0,w(D).
In other words, Lf + µ1f = 0 in the weak sense, and by elliptic regularity
this holds in the classical sense as well.

(iv) Suppose that f1 ∈ C∞

˜f1(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)D

BL( ˜f1, ˜f1) = BL(f1, f1) = µ1 and (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

0 (k, D) satisﬁes Lf1 + µ1f1 = 0. Without loss of
generality, assume that kf1kD = 1. Write f1 = u(x′) cos(kθ), for some
function u on D′ ⊂ Σ′. Consider the function ˜f1 = |u| cos(kθ). Since
= 1, it follows from part (iii)
that L ˜fk + µ1 ˜f1 = 0, and by Proposition 3.8, we get Lk |w| + µ1 |w| = 0.
In any compact region away from the boundary of D′, Lk is a uniformly
elliptic operator with bounded coeﬃcients. By applying the Harnack in-
equality (see e.g. Theorem 8.20 of [GT83]), we conclude that |u| > 0 away
from ∂D′. In other words, u does not vanish anywhere except possibly
on ∂Σ′. By Lemma 3.2, Σ′ \ ∂Σ′ is connected, and by changing the sign
of u if necessary, we have shown that u > 0 in the interior of D′.
This also shows that µ1 < µ2. Assume otherwise. Then there are two
linearly independent eigenfunctions of eigenvalue µ1. By taking linear
combinations of those, we can construct an eigenfunction of the form f1 =
u cos(kθ) where u changes sign. However, such an eigenfunction cannot
exist by the preceding argument. This ﬁnishes the proof of part (i).

17

(v) By standard spectral theory, L2

w(D) has an orthonormal basis consisting
of Dirichlet eigenfunctions of L. Furthermore, the lowest eigenfunction g
is unique, and positive in the interior of D. Since it is unique, it must be
rotationally invariant, i.e. g ∈ C∞(0, Σ). Thus, the eigenvalue correspond-
ing to g is µ1, and by the uniqueness of the lowest eigenvalue (i.e the fact
that µ1 < µ2), we conclude that g = cf for some constant c. The claimed
properties then follow.

4.2 Non-compact domains

When Σ is non-compact, we will analyze the spectrum of L by taking a exhaus-
tion of Σ by compact (rotationally symmetric) domains. The actual choice of
domains will not matter, but for deﬁniteness, we will deﬁne

DR = Σ ∩ BRn+1

R

(0)

(R ≥ 0),

where BRn+1

R

(0) denotes the ball of radius R centered at the origin in Rn+1.

Let µ1(k, DR) denote the lowest eigenvalue in the k-th restricted Dirichlet
eigenvalue spectrum of L on the domain DR. From the characterization in
part (ii) of Theorem 4.3, we see that µ1(k, DS) ≤ µ1(k, DR) whenever S ≥ R.
So we can make the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 4.6. Given a smooth immersed hypersurface Σ, we deﬁne the bottom
of the k-th restricted spectrum of L, denoted µ1(k, Σ), by

µ1(k, Σ) = lim
R→∞

µ1(k, DR).

We allow the value µ1(k, Σ) = −∞.

We can also take a limit of the corresponding eigenfunctions:

Lemma 4.7. Let Σ be a rotationally symmetric shrinker. Fix a compact sub-
set K ′ of Σ′ \ ∂Σ′, a point x′ ∈ K ′, and an integer k ≥ 0. For each R > 0, let
fR denote (some multiple of ) the eigenfunction of L corresponding to the eigen-
value µ1(k, DR). We write it as fR = vR cos(kθ), where vR is a function on D′
R
which is positive in the interior of D′
R.. (This is possible by Theorem 4.3(iv).)
We scale fR so that vR(x′) = 1.

Assume that µ1(k, Σ) > −∞. Then the following hold:
(i) The bounds 0 < c ≤ vR ≤ C hold inside K ′, where the constants c and C

do not depend on R (but do depend on K ′).

(ii) We can ﬁnd a sequence Ri → ∞ such that vRi|K ′ converges in C1(K ′).
(iii) Let wR = log vR. Then wRi also converges in C1(K ′) to some w∞ ∈

C1(K ′).

18

Proof.

(i) vR satisﬁes the elliptic equation LkvR +µ1(k, DR)vR = 0. Since µ1(k, Σ) >
−∞, this equation has bounded coeﬃcients, with the bound not depend-
ing on R. Since we normalized the solution to have vR(x′) = 1, a standard
Harnack inequality (see e.g. Theorem 8.20 of [GT83]) now gives the esti-
mate 0 < c ≤ vR ≤ C in the compact domain K ′.

(ii) Let E′ be a slightly larger compact domain, such that K ′ is contained in
the interior of E′. Applying part (i) to the domain E′, we have |vR| ≤ C
in E′, for some diﬀerent constant C.
We can now apply a standard interior C1,α-estimate for elliptic equations,
Theorem 8.32 of [GT83], in the domain E′ to show that that the C1,α-norm
of vR in K ′ is bounded.
Finally, the Arzel`a-Ascoli theorem then gives a subsequence vRi which
converges in the C1-norm on K ′.

(iii) This is an immediate consequence of parts (i) and (ii). Note that the lower
bound 0 < c ≤ vR is needed to control the denominator of |∇ log uR| =
|∇vR| / |wR|.

Before we state the main result of this section, we need another lemma,

containing a calculation that will be helpful later:

Lemma 4.8. Let Σ be a rotationally symmetric immersed hypersurface in
Rn+1.
(i) Suppose that f, φ ∈ C∞(Σ) and that φ has compact support. Then

h|∇(φf )|2iΣ

=h|∇φ|2 f 2 − φ2fLfiΣ

.

(ii) Suppose that u, φ ∈ C∞(Σ′) (up to the boundary), and that φ has compact

support. Then

h|∇(φu)|2i′

Σ′

=h|∇φ|2 u2 − φ2uL′ui′

Σ′

Proof.

(i) Using the Leibniz rule and expanding, we get

h|∇(φf )|2iΣ

=h|∇φ|2 f 2 + 2φf∇φ · ∇f + φ2 |∇f|2iΣ

By integrating by parts (see Proposition 2.8), we have

−(cid:2)φ2fLf(cid:3)Σ =(cid:2)∇(φ2f ) · ∇f(cid:3)Σ

=h2φf∇φ · ∇f + φ2 |∇f|2iΣ

Substituting this into (13) gives the result.

19

(ii) The proof follows the same steps as in case (i). First, we expand to get

h|∇(φu)|2i′

Σ′

By Proposition 3.3, we have

Σ′

=h2φu∇φ · ∇u + φ2 |∇u|2i′

Σ′

Σ′

−(cid:2)φ2uL′u(cid:3)′

and substitution into (ii) gives the result.

We now come to the main result of this section, which allows us to use global

eigenfunctions to gain spectral information, even in the non-compact case.

Theorem 4.9. Let Σ be a rotationally symmetric shrinker with polynomial
volume growth, and suppose that f ∈ C∞(k, Σ) satisﬁes Lf + λf = 0. Assume
also that f has polynomial growth, i.e. that |f| ≤ p(|x|) for some polynomial p.
(i) Then µ1(k, Σ) ≤ λ.
(ii) We can write f (x) = u(x′) cos(kθ).

If, in addition, u changes sign in

Σ′ \ ∂Σ′, then µ1(k, Σ) < λ.

Proof.
(i) Let φR ∈ C∞(Σ) be a cut-oﬀ function which depends only on |x|, takes
the value 0 outside of DR, takes the value 1 inside DR/2, and which is
approximately linear in |x| in between. We will use φRf as a test function
in the deﬁnition of µ1(k, DR).
Using Lemma 4.8(i), we have

h|∇(φRf )|2iΣ

This means that

We now take the limit R → ∞. Note that the term [|∇φR|2 f 2]Σ is a
weighted integral with weight e−|x|2/4 and integrand supported only in Σ\

20

DR. From the polynomial growth of f , the fact that |∇φR| ≤ C/R for
some constant C, and the fact that Σ has polynomial volume growth, it
follows that this term vanishes in the limit. In other words,

as R → ∞. Since [φ2
obtain

[−φRf L(φRf )]Σ − λ[φ2
Rf 2]Σ is increasing in R, we can divide through to

Rf 2]Σ → 0

For any ﬁxed large R, φRf is a member of C∞

,
and it follows that µ1(k, Σ) ≤ λ.

(ii) Assume, for contradiction, that λ = µ1(k, Σ). Let gR denote the lowest
eigenfunction for L in the k-th restricted spectrum, i.e. corresponding to
the eigenvalue µ1(k, DR). By Theorem 4.3(iv), we can write gR(x) =
vR(x′) cos(kθ), where vR > 0 in the interior of D′
R \ {r = 0}. We can
then deﬁne wR : D′

We will use two diﬀerent cut-oﬀ functions, one to change u to have
compact support, and one to move the support away from the bound-
ary ∂Σ′:
• φR ∈ C∞(Σ′) has compact support inside D′
• ψρ ∈ C∞(Σ′) takes the value 0 in the region Σ′ ∩ {r < ρ}, takes
the value 1 in the region Σ′ ∩ {r > 2ρ}, and is approximately
linear in r in between.
We can choose these functions so that |∇φR| ≤ C/R, and |∇ψρ| ≤
C/ρ, for some universal constant C.

for some constant C′ that depends on R but not on ρ. Furthermore,
u → 0 as r → 0 by Lemma 3.7(ii), and since D′

Now we take the limit R → ∞. This is simpler: µ1(k, DR) → λ by
assumption, and h|∇φR|2 u2i′
R → 0 by the bounds on |∇φR| and
because u has polynomial growth. We thus get lim supR→∞ I R ≤ 0.
On the other hand, we can take the limit directly in the deﬁnition
of I R. Let K ′ be a ﬁxed connected compact subset of Σ′ \ ∂Σ′. By
Lemma 4.7(iii), we can ﬁnd radii Ri → ∞ and a function w∞ such
that wRi → w∞ in C1(K ′). Fatou’s lemma then gives

Combining with lim supR→∞ I R ≤ 0, we conclude that

K ′

This means that ∇u = u∇w∞ everywhere in K ′. Since K ′ is con-
it follows that u = Dew∞ for some constance D, and in
nected,
particular, u does not change sign on K ′. Since K ′ is an arbitrary
connected compact subset of the interior of Σ′, and Σ′ is connected,
this contradicts the assumption that u changes sign, and ﬁnishes the
proof.

Case 2: k = 0. In this case, we do not have the result that u → 0 near
the boundary ∂Σ′. On the other hand, Theorem 4.3(v) ensures that
wR can be deﬁned on the boundary ∂Σ′, which removes the need for
the cutoﬀ function ψρ altogether, and we end up with a simpler proof.
Let uR = φRu, and consider the integral

Because k = 0, Theorem 4.3(v) guarantees that wR is smooth up to

5 F -unstable variations

5.1 Almost orthogonality of spacetime translations

The proof of our main result, Theorem 1.2, will depend on the spectral theory
developed in the previous section, combined with an analysis of the two classes of
eigenfunctions of L we already know, namely H and y· n from Proposition 2.12.
Throughout this section, Σ will be an immersed shrinker of polynomial vol-
ume growth, and like in the previous section, DR will be used to denote the
subdomain Σ ∩ BRn+1
orthogonal:

First of all, we show that the eigenfunctions from Proposition 2.12 are almost

(0).

R

Lemma 5.1. Suppose that the rotationally symmetric shrinker Σ, with poly-
nomial volume growth, satisﬁes µ1(0, Σ) > −∞. Let y ∈ Rn+1 be a constant
vector. Then

[H(y · n)]DR → 0

as R → ∞.
Proof. Let φ be a cutoﬀ function which takes the values 1 inside DR and 0
outside DR+1, and which is approximately linear in |x| in between. We can
choose φ such that |∇φ| ≤ C for some universal constant C.

Using Proposition 2.12, we have

1
2

[φHy · n]Σ = [φ (HL(y · n) − LHy · n)]Σ
= [φ (HL(y · n) − LHy · n)]Σ
= [∇(φy · n) · ∇H − ∇(φH) · ∇(y · n)]Σ
= [∇φ · (∇Hy · n − H∇(y · n))]Σ .

By the shrinker equation, we have H = 1
and so |∇H| ≤ |A||x|. Similarly, |∇(y · n)| ≤ |A||y|. We get

2 x · n. Therefore ∇X H = 1

2 A(xT , X),

1
2 |[φHy · n]Σ| ≤ 2 [|∇φ| |A||x||y|]Σ .

Applying Cauchy-Schwarz, we get

|[φHy · n]Σ| ≤ C |y|h|A|2 |x|2iΣ
Since µ1(0, Σ) > −∞, we know that h|A|2 |x|2iΣ
< ∞ from [CM12] (see Step 1
in the proof of Theorem 9.36, and in particular formula (9.39)). By polynomial
volume growth, we have that [1]DR+1\DR ≤ vol(DR+1)e−R2/4 → 0, and it follows
that

[1]DR+1\DR

.

[φHy · n]Σ → 0.

25

On the other hand, we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

[φHy · n]Σ\DR(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ [|x||y|]DR+1\DR ≤ vol(DR+1)(R + 1)|y| e−R2/4

which tends to zero by polynomial volume growth. Since [H(y · n)]DR =
[φHy · n]Σ − [φHy · n]Σ\DR

, the result follows.

In fact, we need a slightly stronger result, showing that Lemma 5.1 holds as

a uniform limit in a certain sense:

Lemma 5.2. Suppose that the rotationally symmetric shrinker Σ, with polyno-
mial volume growth, satisﬁes µ1(0, Σ) > −∞. Let ∈ Rn+1 be a constant vector
and let ǫ > 0 be arbitrary. Then there exists an R0, depending on ǫ and Σ but
not on y, such that

(20)

[H(y · n)]DR ≤ ǫ(cid:2)H 2(cid:3)1/2

DR(cid:2)(y · n)2(cid:3)1/2

DR

holds whenever R ≥ R0.
Proof. The main idea of the proof is a simple compactness argument, but the
possibility of y · n ≡ 0 gives rise to some technical complications.
If [H 2]Σ = 0, then H ≡ 0 and so [H(y· n)]DR = 0 for all R, and so the result
is trivially true. Thus, we can assume that [H 2]Σ 6= 0, and we let R1 be such
that [H 2]DR1
For any R, we let AR be the set of all y ∈ Rn+1 such that [(y · n)2]DR = 0.
Since this condition is equivalent to y · n being zero everywhere in DR, AR
is a linear subspace of Rn+1. Since R 7→ AR is monotonic, we can let A =
limR→∞ AR. Because Rn+1 is ﬁnite-dimensional, there is some R2 such that
AR = A for all R ≥ R2. We then let B be the orthogonal complement of A in
Rn+1.

Consider the family of functions

which we deﬁne for y ∈ B \ {0} and R ≥ max{R1, R2}. Since the denominator
is positive and increasing in R, Lemma 5.1 shows that fR(y) → 0 as R → ∞, for
each ﬁxed y ∈ B\{0}. Furthermore, note that f is homogeneous of degree 0 in y.
From the fact that each fR is continuous in y, and the fact that the unit sphere
in B is compact, it then follows that fR → 0 as R → ∞, with the convergence
being uniform in y. This means that we can choose an R0 ≥ max{R1, R2} such
that
(21)

fR(y) ≤ ǫ

for all y ∈ B.
y as y = y1 + y2 with y1 ∈ A and y2 ∈ B. Since y1 · n ≡ 0, we get

Suppose now that R ≥ R0, and that y ∈ Rn+1 is arbitrary. We decompose

[H(y · n)]DR
(cid:2)(y · n)2(cid:3)DR

= [H(y2 · n)]DR
=(cid:2)(y2 · n)2(cid:3)DR

.

, and

26

Thus (20) reduces to

[H(y2 · n)]DR ≤ ǫ(cid:2)H 2(cid:3)1/2

DR(cid:2)(y2 · n)2(cid:3)1/2

DR

.

If y2 = 0, then this is trivial; otherwise it follows from (21).

5.2 Bounds for the second variation

To prove Theorem 1.2, we will construct some unstable variations. To show that
they are actually F -unstable, the strategy is to split the terms of the second
variation formula (Proposition 2.11) up into diﬀerent parts, corresponding to
the diﬀerent restricted spectra, and deal with each separately.

For one step, we will need the following elementary “almost Bessel inequal-

ity”:

Lemma 5.3. Suppose that V is a real vector space equipped with an inner
product h·,·i and corresponding norm k·k. Let a, b, v ∈ V , with a and b nonzero
and |ha, bi| ≤ ǫkakkbk, for some small ǫ. Then

We have

By rearranging, we get

(1 − ǫ)(cid:16)hv, ˆai2 + hv, ˆbi2(cid:17) ≤ kvk2 ,

and the desired result follows.

(iii) If either hH or y · n is identically zero on DR, we can easily prove this
using the same technique as in parts (i) and (ii). So we may assume that
they are not.
We note that 0 ≤ ([h2H 2]DR − [f hH]DR)2, from which it follows that

5.3 Proof of the main theorem

The main new content of this section is the following lemma, which constructs
unstable variations assuming spectral information about L.

Let f0 ∈ C∞

0 (0, DR) and f1 ∈ C∞

Lemma 5.5. Let Σ be an immersed, rotationally symmetric, self-shrinking hy-
persurface in Rn+1 with polynomial volume growth, satisfying µ1(0, Σ) < −1
and µ1(1, Σ) < −1/2. For R suﬃciently large (depending on Σ), the following
holds:
0 (1, DR) be eigenfunctions corresponding to
µ1(0, DR) and µ1(1, DR), respectively. Let also g1 ∈ C∞
0,sin(1, DR) be the lowest
eigenfunction of L in C∞
0,sin(1, DR) (i.e. g1 = f1 tan θ). Then any nonzero linear
combination f = αf0 + βf1 + γg1 represents an unstable variation of Σ in the
sense of Deﬁnition 2.13.
Proof. Fix an R ≥ R0, with R0 to be chosen later, and let y ∈ Rn+1 and
h, α, β, γ ∈ R be arbitrary, with the restriction that α, β, and γ not all be zero.
We take f = αf0 + βf1 + γf1,s as in the statement. By Proposition 2.11,
our task is to show that

(cid:20)−f Lf + 2f hH − h2H 2 + f y · n −

1
2

(y · n)2(cid:21)DR

< 0.

(24)

Note that f0, f1, f1,s depend on R, so we will need to take care to ensure that
the conditions we impose on R do not depend on f , nor on y, h, α, β, or γ.

Write y = y0 + y1 + y1,s, where y1 is parallel to en, y1,s is parallel to en+1,
and y0 is orthogonal to both en and en+1. By Proposition 3.9, it follows that
y0 · n ∈ C∞(0, Σ), y1 · n ∈ C∞(1, Σ) and y1,s · n ∈ C∞
sin(1, Σ). Furthermore, we
also have H ∈ C∞(0, Σ).
to the three spaces C∞(0, Σ), C∞(1, Σ), and C∞

We thus have decompositions of f and y · n into components corresponding

sin(1, Σ):

f = αf0 + βf1 + γg1

y · n = y0 · n + y1 · n + y1,s · n.

By substituting these formulas for f and y · n, the left-hand side of (24) can be
split up into components corresponding to those three spaces:

(cid:20)−f Lf + 2f hH − h2H 2 + f y · n −

2

(y · n)2(cid:21)DR

= A + B + C

where

A =(cid:20)−α2f0Lf0 + 2αf0hH − h2H 2 + αf0y0 · n −

(cid:21)DR

, and

,

2

2

29

and where all the other cross terms vanish because of orthogonality between the
spaces.

Note that −f1Lf1 = µ1(1, DR)f 2

1 . Since µ1(1, Σ) < −1/2, we can pick R1
such that µ1(1, DR1) < −1/2. Assuming that R0 ≥ R1, we then have R ≥ R1,
and µ1(1, DR) < −1/2. Thus
B ≤(cid:20)−

and Lemma 5.4(i) now shows that B ≤ 0. Equality holds only when β = 0.
The same argument shows that C ≤ 0, with equality only when γ = 0.
As for A, we have −f0Lf0 = µ0(1, DR)f 2
A =(cid:20)α2µ0(1, DR) + 2αf0hH − h2H 2 + αf0y0 · n −

(y0 · n)2

(cid:21)DR

2

.

To show that A ≤ 0, we will split into two cases:
Case 1: µ1(0, Σ) = −∞. In this case, we can choose R2 such that µ1(0, DR2) <
−3/2. Assuming that R ≥ R2, we get µ0(1, DR) ≤ −3/2, and Lemma
5.4(ii) then shows that A ≤ 0, with equality only if α = 0.

Case 2: −∞ < µ1(0, Σ) < −1. In this case, we ﬁrst choose a large R3 such

that µ1(0, DR3) < −1, and then an ǫ > 0 such that

µ1(0, DR3) < −

1
1 − ǫ

.

(25)

Since µ1(0, Σ) > −∞, Lemma 5.2 shows that we can ﬁnd an R2 ≥ R3,
independent of y, such that

(cid:12)(cid:12)[H(y · n)]DR(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ ǫ [H]1/2

DR(cid:2)(y · n)2(cid:3)1/2

DR

,

whenever R ≥ R2. By monotonicity of µ1(0, DR), (25) also gives

µ1(0, DR) < −

1
1 − ǫ

,

(26)

and we get

A ≤(cid:20)−

1
1 − ǫ

0 + 2αf0hH − hH 2 + αf0y0 · n −
f 2

(y0 · n)2

2

(cid:21)DR

.

Now, we can apply Lemma 5.4(iii) to show that A ≤ 0. Again, equality is
only possible if α = 0.

Assuming that we initially picked R0 = max{R2, R3}, we have shown that
A ≤ 0, B ≤ 0, and C ≤ 0, with simultaneous equality only happening when
α = β = γ = 0. Since f is assumed non-zero, we in fact get A + B + C < 0. This
holds for all possible y and h, and thus f represents an unstable variation.

Lemma 5.6. Suppose Σ is an immersed, rotationally symmetric self-shrinking
hypersurface with polynomial volume growth. Write en · n = u(x′) cos(θ), where
u is a function on Σ′, and assume that u changes sign in the interior of Σ′.
Then H changes sign on Σ.

Proof. Suppose not, i.e. that H ≥ 0 for a suitable choice of normal direction. If
Σ is embedded, Theorem 10.1 of [CM12] gives that Σ is a sphere, a cylinder, or
a plane. For these shrinkers, u does not change sign, which rules them out.

Since our Σ is not necessarily embedded, we need to say a little more. The
proof of Theorem 10.1 in [CM12] (see also the remarks below Theorem 0.17 in
the same work) reveals that embeddedness is only used to rule out shrinkers of
the form Σ = C × Rn−1, where C is one of the non-embedded self-shrinking
curves discovered by Abresch and Langer in [AL86]. However, these shrinkers
are only rotationally symmetric if n − 1 ≥ 2 and the rotation axis is orthogonal
to the Rn−1 part. In that case, we have en · n ≡ 0, and so u does not change
sign. This ﬁnishes the proof even in the immersed case.

Finally, we are in a position to prove the main theorem:

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Consider the functions H and en · n on Σ. By Proposi-
tion 2.12, they are eigenfunctions of L of eigenvalues −1 and −1/2, respectively.
By Proposition 3.9, we have H ∈ C∞(0, Σ) and en·n ∈ C∞(1, Σ). Furthermore,
since |H| = |x · n| /2 ≤ |x| /2 and |en · n| ≤ 1, both functions have polynomial
growth. We can write en · n = u(x′) cos(θ), where u changes sign on Σ′ by
assumption. By Lemma 5.6, H = v cos(0) changes sign too. Theorem 4.9 now
tells us that µ1(0, Σ) < −1 and µ1(0, Σ) < −1/2, and Lemma 5.5 shows that
the F -index of Σ is at least 3.

Proof of Corollary 1.3. Let C ⊂ R≥0 × R be the image of Σ under the quotient
map Rn+1 → Rn+1/SO(n). By the same reasoning as in the proof of Lemma 3.2,
C is an immersed curve whose interior is connected.
Let eR denote the ﬁrst standard basis vector in R≥0 × R. We will ﬁrst show
that eR · n changes sign on C. If Σ is embedded, then by the classiﬁcation in
Theorem 2 of [KM14], C is a closed curve, and thus eR · n must change sign on
C. On the other hand, if Σ is not embedded, then C is not embedded either.
Since C is connected, one section of C must be a closed loop, and again, it
follows that eR · n must change sign on C.
Now, C can be identiﬁed with a particular one-dimensional slice of Σ, on
which er · n is equal to the function eR · n on C. Thus er · n changes sign on Σ,
and we can apply Theorem 1.2.

5.4 Entropy index

In this section, we will prove Corollary 1.4, which says that under the hypotheses
of either Theorem 1.2 or Corollary 1.3, the entropy index is at least 3.

First of all, we specify what is meant by this conclusion. Being a supremum
of F -functionals, the entropy is not twice diﬀerentiable even in a formal sense,

31

so it is not immediately clear what the entropy index means. We make the
following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 5.7. Suppose that Σ is an immersed shrinker in Rn+1. We say
that Σ has entropy index at least k if we can ﬁnd a linear space V , consisting
of smooth, normal vector ﬁelds to Σ, with dim V = k, satisfying the following
property: If X is any nonzero vector ﬁeld in V , and Σs is any variation of Σ
with variation vector ﬁeld V , then there is some ǫ > 0 such that λ(Σs) < λ(Σ)
for all s ∈ (−ǫ, ǫ) \ {0}.

In the situation when the shrinker Σ does not split oﬀ a line isometrically,
results in [CM12] give Corollary 1.4 as a direct consequence of Theorem 1.2 and
Corollary 1.3. In the case when Σ does split oﬀ a line, we will supply a little
more reasoning, in the form of the two following lemmas.

Lemma 5.8. Suppose that Σ is an immersed, self-shrinking hypersurface in
Rn+1. Write Σ as an isometric product ˜Σ × Rm. If Σ satisﬁes the hypotheses
of either Theorem 1.2 or Corollary 1.3, then so does ˜Σ.
Proof. We decompose Rn+1 as V1 ⊕ V2, where dim V1 = m, and V1 consists of
the same directions as the factor Rm in the decomposition Σ = ˜Σ× Rm. In this
way, we can view ˜Σ as an immersed hypersurface in V2, and it is easy to see
that ˜Σ is a shrinker.

We now split into two cases:

Case 1: Σ satisﬁes the hypotheses of Corollary 1.3. Σ is not a sphere,
cylinder or a plane, and therefore, neither is ˜Σ. Furthermore, Σ is in-
variant under a subgroup SO(n) ⊂ SO(n + 1). Letting W denote the
n-dimensional hyperplane in Rn+1 on which this SO(n) acts, a simple di-
mension count shows that dim W ∩ V2 ≥ dim V2 − 1. It follows that ˜Σ, as
an immersed hypersurface in V2, is invariant under a subgroup SO(n− m)
of SO(n + 1 − m). Thus, ˜Σ also satisﬁes the hypotheses of Corollary 1.3.

Case 2: Σ satisﬁes the hypotheses of Theorem 1.2. In particular, this means

that we can ﬁnd a decomposition Rn+1 = W1 ⊕ W2, where dim W1 = 2,
and where Σ is invariant under the group SO(2) acting as rotations in
W1.
Assume, as a hypothesis for contradiction, that W1 not perpendicular to
V1. Let v ∈ V1 be a vector whose orthogonal projection onto W1, which
we will call Πv, is non-zero. Let also R denote rotation by an angle π in
W1. By assumption, Σ is invariant under both R and translation by cv,
for any c ∈ R. Therefore, it must be invariant under the composition

x 7→ R−1(cid:18)R(cid:18)x +

1
2

cv(cid:19) −

1
2

cv(cid:19) .

A little algebra reveals that the right-hand side simpliﬁes to x + cΠv; in
other words, Σ is invariant under translations by cΠv as well. Since Πv is

32

nonzero, we can show that Σ is invariant under translations by any vector
in W1 by considering conjugations of translations by cΠv and rotations
in W1. This means that the tangent plane TxΣ of Σ must be parallel
to W1 for all x ∈ Σ., which in turn implies that er · n = 0 everywhere
(where er is a vector parallel to W1 which points radially outward), which
contradicts the second hypothesis of Theorem 1.2. Thus we see that W1
must be perpendicular to V1, or in other words, contained in V2.
From this, it now follows easily that ˜Σ is invariant under this copy of
SO(2), thought of as acting on V2. Furthermore, er · n must then change
sign on ˜Σ, because it does on Σ. Thus, we conclude that ˜Σ satisﬁes the
hypotheses of Theorem 1.2.

Lemma 5.9. Suppose that Σ is an immersed, self-shrinking hypersurface in
Rn+1. Write Σ as an isometric product ˜Σ× Rm. If ˜Σ has entropy index at least
k, then so does does Σ.

Proof. Given a variation ˜Σs of ˜Σ, we can extend it to a variation of Σ by taking
Σs = ˜Σs × Rm. It is fairly easy to see that λ(Σs) = λ( ˜Σs) (see the proof of
Theorem 0.12 in Section 11.2 of [CM12]).
This way, any variation of ˜Σ which is unstable for the entropy (in the sense
of Deﬁnition 5.7) gives an unstable variation of ˜Σ. Since ˜Σ has a k-dimensional
vector space worth of such variations, so does Σ.

Proof of Corollary 1.4. Assume ﬁrst that Σ does not split oﬀ a line isometrically.
By Theorem 1.2 or Corollary 1.3, we can ﬁnd a subspace V , of dimension 3,
consisting of F -unstable variation vector ﬁelds. Suppose that X is a vector ﬁeld
in V , and that Σs is a variation with variation vector ﬁeld X. By Theorem 0.15
of [CM12] (or more precisely, by the proof, which is found in section 7.2 of that
work), we have λ(Σs) < λ(Σ) for s nonzero and suﬃciently small. Since this
holds for any X ∈ V , this shows that Σ has entropy index at least 3.
If Σ does split oﬀ a line, Theorem 0.15 of [CM12] does not apply. However, we
can write Σ = ˜Σ× Rm, where ˜Σ does not split oﬀ a further line. By Lemma 5.8,
˜Σ also satisﬁes the hypotheses of either Theorem 1.2 or Corollary 1.3. By the
previous reasoning, this means that ˜Σ has entropy index at least 3, and by
Lemma 5.9, Σ also has entropy index at least 3.

6 Regularity

The analysis of the preceding sections assumes that the shrinker is smooth. In
this section, we will make some remarks on the connection between index and
regularity.

The main theorem is this:

Theorem 6.1. Let Σ be an n-dimensional integral varifold in Rn+1 which is
stationary with respect to the functional F0,1, and suppose that Σ satisﬁes the

33

volume bound vol(Br(x) ∩ Σ) ≤ V rn for all 0 < r < 1. Assume that n ≤ 6, and
also that Σ satisﬁes the α-Structural Hypothesis of Wickramasekera([Wic14])
for some α ∈ (0, 1).Then the F -index of the regular part of Σ is greater than or
equal to the number of singular points of Σ.

Proof. The proof is adapted from Section 12 of [CM12].

First of all, if U is an open set in Rn+1, we will call Σ¬U F -stable if any
function φ which has compact support in reg Σ ∩ U is a stable variation in the
sense of Deﬁnition 2.13.
Assume that Σ¬U is F -stable. Given ǫ > 0, Lemma 12.7 of [CM12] shows

that

• Σ is a stationary varifold in the Riemannian manifold U ⊂ Rn+1 with

respect to the metric gij = e−|x|2/4δij.

• For r0 small enough (depending on ǫ), if φ is a function supported in some

ball Br0(x0) ∩ reg Σ satisﬁes

ZΣ |Ag|2

g φ2d volg ≤ (1 + ǫ)ZΣ |∇gφ|2

g d volg .

By the version of Wickramasekera’s main regularity theorem ([Wic14]) formu-
lated as Proposition 12.25 in [CM12], in fact Σ¬U is smooth.

Suppose now that we have k distinct singular points x1, . . . , xk in Σ. Let
U1, . . . , Uk be disjoint open neighborhoods of x1, . . . , xk in Rn+1. For each i,
since Σ¬Ui has a singularity, the preceding argument shows that we must have
a function φi with support in reg Σ ∩ U such that φi represents an unstable
variation of Σ. Since these φi have disjoint supports, any linear combination
Pk
i=1 aiφi will also represent an unstable variation. It follows that Σ has F -

index at least k.
