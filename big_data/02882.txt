A Dual Representation of Functions

on Wasserstein Spaces

Yun Shen∗

March 9, 2016

Abstract

We prove a duality theorem of the Fenchel-Moreau type for convex and lower
semicontinuous functions of probability measures on Polish spaces equipped
with the Wasserstein metric of order 1. The derived dual representation is in
form of its conjugate function on Lipschitz functions.

Introduction

Dual representation, supported by the Fenchel-Moreau theorem (see e.g., [1, 12]),
plays an important role in convex analysis and has wide applications in various ﬁelds
(see e.g., [2, 3]). In mathematical ﬁnance, especially in the research of risk measures
[5, Chapter 4], there is an ongoing interest to obtain a dual representation of risk
measures [7] on various settings.

More speciﬁcally, let Cb be the set of all bounded continuous functions on a Polish
space X and P be the space of all probability measures on X. A function ρ : Cb → R
is said to be a risk measure, if it is (i) monotone, i.e., ρ(f ) ≤ ρ(g), whenever f (x) ≤
g(x), ∀x ∈ X; and (ii) translation invariance, i.e., ρ(f + r) = ρ(f ) + r, ∀f ∈ Cb, r ∈ R.
Then, it is known [5, Theorem 4.22] that if a risk measure is convex and lower

semicontinuous, then it has the dual representation ρ(f ) = maxµ∈P(cid:0)R f dµ − φ(µ)(cid:1) ,
where φ : P → R satisﬁes that φ(µ) = supf ∈Cb(cid:0)R f dµ − ρ(µ)(cid:1) . This result can be

viewed as an application of the Fenchel-Moreau theorem on Cb, whose, endowed with
the weak topology, dual space is the space of all ﬁnitely additive measures ba ⊃ P.
Since then, much eﬀects have been taken to obtain a similar duality for function
spaces other than Cb, e.g., L0 (see [7]), whose dual space is not identiﬁed.

In this paper, we are interested in the conjugate function of risk measures, which
is a function on probability measures. This type of functions emerges not only from
the above dual representation of risk measures, but also from many stochastic optimal
control problems. For instance, in partially observable Markov control problems (see

∗Fakult¨at Elektrotechnik und Informatik, Technische Universit¨at Berlin, Marchstr. 23, 10587,

Berlin, Germany (yun.shen@tu-berlin.de).

e.g., [4]), it is known that the optimal solution is a function on probability measures.
More speciﬁcally, given a convex and lower semicontinuous function φ : P → ¯R :=
R ∪ {±∞}, we would like to ask whether its has a dual representation as the one for
risk measures.

Note that we cannot apply Fenchel-Moreau theorem, because it is diﬃcult to
identify the dual space of P, endowed with the weak topology. Besides, we hope
also that the derived dual space has good features and is easy to deal with. Our
solution here is to apply the Wasserstein metric (see e.g., [10, Chapter 6]), which
yields nice topological properties.

Main result Let (X, d) be a Polish space and P1 be the Wasserstein space of
probability measures on X with order 1, equipped with the Wasserstein metric W1.
Let L denote the space of all real-valued Lipschitz functions on X. A formal deﬁni-
tion is given in Section 2. Consider a function φ : P1 → ¯R. The (Fenchel) conjugate
function of φ, ρ : L → ¯R, is deﬁned as

ρ(f ) := sup

µ∈P1(cid:18)Z f dµ − φ(µ)(cid:19)

and the second conjugate function φc : P1 → ¯R is deﬁned as

φc(µ) := sup

f ∈L(cid:18)Z f dµ − ρ(f )(cid:19) .

It is easy to verify that ρ is a risk measure on L . We state now the main theorem
of this paper.

Theorem 1.1. Let φ : P1 → ¯R be a convex and lower semicontinuous function on
(P1, W1) satisfying φ(µ) > −∞ for all µ ∈ P1 and there exists a µ ∈ P1 such that
φ(µ) ∈ R. Then φ(µ) = φc(µ), ∀µ ∈ P1.

It is remarkable that we cannot derive the above result directly from the Fenchel-
Moreau theorem, since it requires to know the dual space of (P1, W1), which, to our
best knowledge, has not been identiﬁed yet.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce brieﬂy
the Wasserstein space and its key properties. In Section 3, we present the proof of
the duality Theorem 1.1. Finally, in Section 4, we state a similar duality theorem in
the weighted norm space, where the weight function is related to the metric of the
underlying Polish space.

2 Wasserstein space

Let (X, d) be a Polish space. Let P be the space of all probability measures on X.
Then the Wasserstein space of order p, p ≥ 1 is deﬁned as

Pp :=(cid:26)µ ∈ P|Z d(x0, x)pµ(dx) < ∞(cid:27)

where x0 ∈ X is arbitrary and its distance (called Wasserstein distance) is deﬁned as

Wp(µ, ν) := infn[E (d(X, Y )p)]1/p(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

law(X) = µ, law(Y ) = νo .

2

For any real-valued function f : X → R, its Lipschitz seminorm is deﬁned as

kf kLip := sup
x6=y

|f (x) − f (y)|

d(x, y)

.

Denote by L the space of all real-valued Lipschitz functions on X

L := {f : X → R|kf kLip < ∞} .

Deﬁne [L ]1 := {f ∈ L |kf kLip ≤ 1} as the unit ball of L .

Note that it is easy to verify the integral R f dµ is well deﬁned for any f ∈ L

and µ ∈ P1. Furthermore, when p = 1, we have the following duality formula [10,
Chapter 5]

W1(µ, ν) = sup

f ∈[L ]1(cid:26)Z f dµ −Z f dν(cid:27) .

(1)

In this case, the above distance is also called Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.

We state below the key property of Wasserstein spaces.

Theorem 2.1. Let (X, d) be a Polish space. Then, for each p ≥ 1, (Pp, Wp) is also a
Polish space, i.e., a complete separable metric space. In particular, let D := {xi, i =
1, 2, . . .} be a dense subset of X, then for any µ ∈ Pp(X) and ǫ > 0, there exists a
subset of {xk, k = 1, 2, . . . , n} ⊂ D and rational numbers {ak, k = 1, 2, . . . , ak ≥ 0}
k=1 ak = 1 and δx denotes

such that Wp(µ,Pn

the Dirac measure at x.

k=1 akδxk ) < ǫ, where {ak} satisfying Pn

Proof. See the proof of Theorem 6.18 in [10].

In the rest of this paper, we focus on the Wasserstein space with order 1, P1.

3 Proof of duality

We ﬁrst consider the dense subset of P1. Let D := {xi, i = 1, 2, . . .} be a dense
subset of X. Let D be the space of all probability measures in P with a ﬁnite
support, which is contained in D, i.e.,

D :=( n
Xi=1

aiδxi(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

n ∈ N, ai ∈ R+i = 1, 2, . . . , n,

ai = 1) ,

(2)

n

Xi=1

By Theorem 2.1, D is dense in P1 equipped with the Wasserstein metric W1. Re-
placing the Dirac measure with the indicator function

in D, we deﬁne the following set of real-valued functions on X

1x(y) :=(cid:26) 1 x = y

0 x 6= y

n ∈ N, ai ∈ R+, i = 1, 2, . . . , n,

ai = 1) .

(3)

n

Xi=1

Apparently D and D are isometric and let ψ : D → D be the bijective mapping. Fix
a point ν0 ∈ D. Then we have

D :=( n
Xi=1

ai1xi(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
Xx∈D

ψ(ν)(x) − ψ(ν0)(x) = 0, ∀ν ∈ D.

We will see below that ψ(ν) − ψ(ν0) is in fact an element of the Arens-Eells space,
whose dual space is exactly the space of all Lipschitz functions, L .

3

3.1 The Arens-Eells space

We recall some results of the Arens-Eells space based on [11, Section 2.2 and 2.3].

Definition 3.1. Let (X, d) be a metric space. A molecule of X is a function m :

X → R which is supported on a ﬁnite set and which satisﬁes Px∈X m(x) = 0.

For any x, y ∈ X deﬁne the molecule mxy = 1x − 1y, where 1x denotes the

indicator function on the singleton set {x}. Deﬁne the following seminorm

|ai|d(xi, yi)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
kmkÆ := inf( n
Xi=1

m =

aimxiyi)

n

Xi=1

and let Æ be the completion of the space of molecules, which is also called Arens-
Eells sapce. The following theorem states that Æ is one predual of L , the space of
Lipschitz functions.

Theorem 3.2 (Theorem 2.2.2 [11]). Let (X, d) be a metric space with at least one
point x0. Then the space of Lipschitz functions L is an isometric isomorphism of
Æ∗, the dual space of Æ, i.e., Æ∗ = L . In particular, for any f ∈ Æ∗, kf k = kf kLip.

For any f ∈ L and m ∈ Æ, we deﬁne

hf, mi :=Xx∈X

f (x)m(x).

Corollary 3.3. (i) kmkÆ = maxf ∈[L ]1 hf, mi. (ii) k·kÆ is a norm on Æ .

Proof. See [11, Corollary 2.2.3].

Recall that D deﬁned in (2) is the space of all probability measures in P with a
ﬁnite support, which is contained in a dense subset D ⊂ X, and D deﬁned in (3) is
its corresponding space of functions on X, with ψ : D − D being the bijective map.

Proposition 3.4. W1(ν, ν0) = k ˜ψ(ν) − ψ(ν0)kÆ, for any ν ∈ D and ν0 ∈ D.

Proof. By the dual representation of W1, we have

W1(ν, ν0) = sup

(ψ(ν)(x) − ψ(ν0)(x)) f (x)

f ∈[L ]1Z f dν −Z f ν0
f ∈[L ]1Xx∈X

= sup

=k ˜ψ(ν) − ψ(ν0)kÆ,

where the last equality is due to Corollary 3.3(ii).

3.2 A separation theorem on D

We are now ready to state a separation theorem on D. We ﬁrst restate the Nirenberg-
Luenberger theorem (see Section 5.13, [8], also known as the minimum norm duality
theorem).

Definition 3.5. Let K be a convex set in a real normed vector space X. Let X ∗
be its dual space. The function h(x∗) = supx∈Khx, x∗i on X ∗ is called the support
functional of K.

4

Theorem 3.6. Let x1 be a point in a real normed space X and let d > 0 denotes its
distance rom the convex set K having support functional h. Then

d = kx − x1k = max
kx∗k≤1

[hx1, x∗i − h(x∗)]

where the maximum on the right is achieved by some x∗

0 ∈ X ∗.

Theorem 3.7. Let K be a convex set of D and ν0 ∈ D be a point not contained in
K satisfying W1(ν, ν0) ≥ ǫ > 0, ∀ν ∈ K. Then there exists a function f ∈ [L ]1 such

that R f dν ≥R f dν0 + ǫ, ∀ν ∈ K.

Proof. Since K is convex, K ′ := {ψ(ν) − ψ(µ0) | ν ∈ K} is also convex in Æ . To
apply Theorem 3.6, we set X = Æ and its dual is X ∗ = Æ∗ = L . By the deﬁnition
of h, we have

h(f ) = sup
m∈K ′

hf, mi = sup

ν∈K(cid:26)Z f dν −Z f dν0(cid:27) , f ∈ L .

Then by Theorem 3.6, we obtain

ǫ ≤ inf
ν∈K

W1(ν, ν0) = inf

m∈K ′

kmkÆ = max
f ∈[L ]1

[−h(f )] ,

which yields

max

f ∈[L ]1(cid:20) inf

ν∈KZ (−f )dν −Z (−f )dν0(cid:21) ≥ ǫ.

Suppose the maximum is attained at f0. Then

inf

ν∈KZ (−f0)dν −Z (−f0)dν0 ≥ ǫ.
which implies that R (−f0)dν ≥R (−f0)dν0 + ǫ, ∀ν ∈ K.

In later sections, we need to consider the dual space of the Cartesian product
Æ ×R, where we can obtain a similar result as above. The operator ∨ is deﬁned as
a ∨ b := max(a, b).
Theorem 3.8. Let ˜K be a convex set of D × R and (ν0, r0) ∈ D × R be a point
not contained in K. Suppose W1(ν, ν0) ∨ |r − r0| ≥ ǫ > 0, ∀(ν, r) ∈ ˜K. Then
there exists a function (f, α) ∈ [L ]1 × [−1, 1] satisfying kf kLip + |α| ≤ 1 such that

R f dν + αr ≥R f dν0 + αr0ǫ, ∀(ν, r) ∈ ˜K.

Proof. Let Æ ×R be equipped with the canonical norm k(m, r)k := kmkÆ ∨ |r|. An
easy extension of Theorem 3.2 shows that its dual space is isometric with L × R
with the norm k(f, r)k = kf kLip + |r|, i.e., (Æ ×R)∗ = L × R.

The rest of the proof follows similarly as in the proof of Theorem 3.7 and is

therefore omitted.

3.3 A separation theorem on Wasserstein space

We extend the separation Theorem 3.7 to the whole Wasserstein space P1.

Theorem 3.9. Let A be a convex and closed subset in P1 under the Wasserstein
metric W1. Let µ0 ∈ P1 be a point not contained in A. Then there exists a function

f ∈ L such that R f dµ >R f dµ0, ∀µ ∈ A.

5

Proof. Step 1. We ﬁrst show that there exists a positive constant ǫ0 > 0 satisfying

W1(µ, µ0) ≥ ǫ0, ∀µ ∈ A.

for any ǫ > 0, there exists some µ ∈ A satisfy-
Indeed, suppose the opposite:
ing W1(µ, µ0) < ǫ. Then we can ﬁnd a set of {µn ∈ A, n = 1, 2, . . .} satisfying
W1(µn, µ0) < 1/n, n = 1, 2, . . . . Hence, µn → µ0 implies that µ0 ∈ A due to the fact
that A is closed. It contradicts the assumption µ0 /∈ A.

Step 2. Let D := {x1, x2, . . .} be a dense set in X and D as deﬁned in (2), i.e., the
space of all probability measures with ﬁnite support contained in D. By Theorem
2.1, we can approximate µ by a point ν ∈ D with any accuracy. Furthermore, D is
essentially embedded in Æ, whose dual space is known to be L . Finally, Theorem
3.7 can be applied to ﬁnd the required separation function in L .

More speciﬁcally, take ǫ1 = ǫ0/5 and deﬁne subsets of D as follows

Bǫ1(µ) := {ν ∈ D | W1(µ, ν) < ǫ1}, Aǫ1 := [µ∈A

Bǫ1(µ).

Since D is dense in (P1, W1), Bǫ1(µ) 6= ∅, ∀µ ∈ P1. Hence, for any νi ∈ Aǫ1 there
exists a µi ∈ P1 such that W1(νi, µi) < ǫ1, i = 1, 2. Let να := αν1 + (1 − α)ν2 and
µα := αµ1 + (1 − α)µ2, α ∈ (0, 1). We have, by the dual representation (1) of W1,

W1(να, µα) ≤ αW1(ν1, µ1) + (1 − α)W1(ν2, µ2) < ǫ1,

which implies that Aǫ1 is convex. Similarly, we can ﬁnd a ν0 ∈ D such that
W1(µ0, ν0) < ǫ1. Note that

W1(ν, µ) ≥W1(µ0, µ) − W1(µ0, ν0) − W1(ν0, ν)

≥ǫ0 − ǫ1 − W1(ν0, ν),

∀ν ∈ Aǫ1, µ ∈ A,

yields inf µ∈A W1(ν, µ) ≥ ǫ0 − ǫ1 − W1(ν0, ν), ∀ν ∈ Aǫ1 . Since ǫ1 ≥ inf µ∈A W1(ν, µ),
we have W1(ν0, ν) ≥ ǫ0 − 2ǫ1 > 0, ∀ν ∈ Aǫ1 . Hence, by Theorem 3.7, there exists a
function f0 ∈ L : kf0kLip ≤ 1 such that

Z f0dν ≥Z f0dν0 + ǫ0 − 2ǫ1, ∀ν ∈ Aǫ1.

(4)

Step 3. Finally, we show that f0 is the required Lipschitz function. For each

µ ∈ A there exists an νµ ∈ Aǫ1 such that W1(µ, νµ) < ǫ1 and hence R f dµ ≥
R f dνµ − ǫ1, ∀f ∈ [L ]1. This implies,

Z f0dµ ≥Z f0dνµ − ǫ1.

(5)

Similarly, W1(µ0, ν0) < ǫ1 implies

Z f0dν0 ≥Z f0dµ0 − ǫ1.

(6)

Combining (4) – (6), we obtain

Z f0dµ ≥Z f0dµ0 + ǫ0 − 4ǫ1 =Z f0dµ0 +

ǫ0
5

, ∀µ ∈ A,

which yields the required separability.

6

Analogously, we can obtain the same separation result in the space of P1 × R

which will be used in the next subsection.

Theorem 3.10. Let ˜A be a convex and closed subset in P1 × R with the metric
˜d((µ, r1), (ν, r2)) := W1(µ, ν) ∨ |r1 − r2|. Let (µ0, r0) ∈ P1 × R be a point not
contained in A. Then there exists a function (f, α) ∈ L ∈ R such that

Z f dµ + αr >Z f dµ0 + αr0, ∀(µ, r) ∈ ˜A.

Proof. The proof follows similarly as the proof of Theorem 3.9 and is therefore omit-
ted.

3.4 Proof of the duality

We shall prove the main duality theorem in this subsection. It is remarkable that
our proofs of Lemma 3.13 and the duality theorem (Theorem 3.14) mainly follow the
line of the proof of Theorem 2.2.15 of [1].

Definition 3.11. For a function φ : P1 → ¯R, its domain is dom(φ) := {µ ∈ P1 :
φ(µ) < +∞}. φ is said to be proper if φ(µ) > −∞ for all µ ∈ P1 and dom(φ) 6= ∅.
The epigraph of φ is deﬁned as epi(φ) := {(µ, r) ∈ P1 × R | φ(µ) ≤ r}.

Proposition 3.12. If φ : P1 → ¯R is convex and lower semicontinuous (equipped
with the metric W1), then epi(φ) is convex and closed under the metric

˜d((µ, a), (ν, b)) := W1(µ, ν) ∨ |a − b|.

Proof. The convexity is easy to verify. We show here only the closeness. Let
{(µn, an) ∈ P1 × R, n = 1, 2, . . .} be any converging sequence in epi(φ) under the
metric ˜d. Hence, we have φ(µn) ≤ an, ∀n = 1, 2, . . . . Note that converging under ˜d
implies that µn converges to a probability measure µ0 ∈ P1 (equipped with W1) and
an converges to a real number a0 ∈ R. By the lower semicontinuity, we have

φ(µ0) ≤ lim inf
n→∞

φ(µn) ≤ lim inf
n→∞

an = a0,

which implies that (µ0, a0) ∈ epi(φ). Hence, epi(φ) is closed.

Note that by the deﬁnition of the second dual function, φc, we have

φc(µ0) = sup

(f,η)∈M(cid:26)Z f dµ0 + η(cid:27) , where,

M :=(cid:26)(f, η) ∈ L × R(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Z f dµ + η ≤ φ(µ), ∀µ ∈ P1(cid:27) .

(7)

(8)

Lemma 3.13. Let φ : P1 → ¯R be a proper, convex and lower semicontinuous function
(equipped with the metric W1). Then the set M is not empty.

Proof. Since φ is proper, there exists an element ν ∈ P1 such that φ(ν) ∈ R. Then
epi(φ) 6= ∅ and (ν, φ(ν) − 1) /∈ epi(φ). By Theorem 3.10, there exists (f0, η0) ∈ L × R
such that

Z f0dν + η0(φ(ν) − 1) <Z f0dµ + η0r, ∀(µ, r) ∈ epi(f ).

7

Since (ν, φ(ν)) ∈ epi(f ), we have η0 > 0 and (1/η0)(cid:0)R f0dν −R f0dµ(cid:1) + φ(ν) − 1 <

r, ∀(µ, r) ∈ epi(φ). For any µ ∈ dom(f ), (µ, φ(µ)) ∈ epi(φ) and hence

1

η0 (cid:18)Z f0dν −Z f0dµ(cid:19) + φ(ν) − 1 < φ(µ).

This inequality can in fact be extended to all µ ∈ P1. Thus, (−f0/η0, φ(ν) − 1 +

R f0dν/η0) is one element of M .

We restate Theorem 1.1 as follows.

Theorem 3.14. Let φ : P1 → ¯R be a proper, convex and lower semicontinuous
function on (P1, W1). Then φ(µ) = φc(µ), ∀µ ∈ P1.

Proof. By deﬁnition, we have ρ(f ) ≥R f dµ − φ(µ), ∀(µ, f ) ∈ P1 × L , which implies
R f dµ − ρ(f ) ≤ φ(µ), ∀(µ, f ) ∈ P1 × L , and hence φc(µ) ≤ φ(µ), ∀µ ∈ P1.

Below we show that φ(µ) ≤ φc(µ), ∀µ ∈ P1. Assume the opposite: there exists

a µ0 ∈ P1 and r0 ∈ R such that

φ(µ0) > r0 > φc(µ0) = sup

(f,η)∈M(cid:26)Z f dµ0 + η(cid:27) ,

(9)

where M is deﬁne in (8). It is clear that (µ0, r0) /∈ epi(φ). Note that by Proposition
3.12, epi(φ) is closed. Hence, by Theorem 3.10, there exists a (f0, η0) ∈ L × R such
that

Z f0dµ + η0r >Z f0dµ0 + η0r0 + ǫ, ∀(µ, r) ∈ epi(φ),

(10)

Note that if (µ, r) ∈ epi(φ), then (µ, r + s) ∈ A for any s ≥ 0. Thus η0 ≥ 0.

Suppose φ(µ0) ∈ R. Using the fact that (µ0, φ(µ0)) ∈ A, we obtain η0(φ(µ0) −

r0) > 0. Hence η0 > 0. Since (µ, φ(µ)) ∈ R, we obtain φ(µ) > 1
1

η0 R f0dµ + r0. Now setting η = r0 + 1
R f dµ0 + η = r0, which contradicts (9).
becomes R f0dµ > R f0dµ0 + ǫ, ∀(µ, r) ∈ epi(φ). By Lemma 3.13, the set M deﬁned

Hence, φ(µ0) = +∞. If η0 > 0, the contradiction remains. Thus η0 = 0 and (10)

η0 R f0dµ0 and f = − f0

in (8) is not empty. Hence, there exists (f1, a1) ∈ M such that

η0 R f0dµ0 −

in (9), we have

η0

Z f1dµ + a1 ≤ φ(µ), ∀µ ∈ P1.

By the assumption made in (9), b := (r0 −R f1dµ0 − a1)/ǫ > 0. For all µ ∈ dom(f ),

(11)

Z (f1 − bf0)dµ +Z bf0dµ0 + a1 + bǫ
=Z f1dµ + a1 + b(cid:18)−Z f0dµ +Z f0dµ0 + ǫ(cid:19)
≤Z f1dµ + a1 ≤ φ(µ).

This can be extended to all µ ∈ P1. Hence, (f1 − bf0,R bf0dµ0 + a1 + bǫ) ∈ M.
Taking µ = µ0 in (11), we haveR (f1 − bf0)dµ0 +R bf0dµ0 + a1 + bǫ = r0, which again

contradicts (9).

4 Duality in weighted space

The weighted norm space is proved to be quite useful in understanding the properties
of Markov processes (see e.g., [9, 6]).

Let (X, d) be a Polish space with a point x0 ∈ X. We specify a weight function

w : X → [1, ∞) as follows

w(x) := 1 + β · d(x0, x), β > 0, ∀x ∈ X.

It is easy to verify that w is Lipschitz, and therefore continuous and measurable.

Denote by Lw the space of all continuous functions on X such that

kf kw := sup
x∈X

|f (x)|
w(x)

< ∞.

Definition 4.1. We say µn weakly converges to µ in Pw, if for each f ∈ Lw,

Let Pw ⊂ P be the space of probability measures on X, µ, satisfying R wdµ < ∞.
R f dµn →R f dµ.

Proposition 4.2. (i ) L ⊂ Lw. (ii) Pw = P1. (iii) The weak convergence in Pw
is equivalent to the convergence in (P1, W1).

Proof. It is easy to verify (i). We show below only (ii) and (iii).

(ii). If µ ∈ Pw, then we have

∞ >Z wdµ ≥Z (1 + βd(x0, ·)) dµ = 1 + βZ d(x0, ·)dµ

implies that Pw ⊂ P1. Now take one µ ∈ P1. Then

Z (w − w(x0)) dµ =Z wdµ − w(x0) ≤ kwkLipZ d(x0, ·)dµ < ∞.

Hence, P1 ⊂ Pw, which yields Pw = P1.

(iii) Note that d′(x, y) = βd(x, y) induced the same topological space and there-

fore the same probability space. The rest is due to Theorem 6.9 of [10].

Hence, (iii) implies that (P1, W1) equals to the Pw endowed with the weak
topology. Now we consider the duality problem on Pw and Lw. The conjugate
function of φ : Pw → ¯R on Lw, ρ : Lw → ¯R, is deﬁned as

ρ(f ) := sup

µ∈Pw(cid:18)Z f dµ − φ(µ)(cid:19)

and the second conjugate function φc : P1 → ¯R is deﬁned as

φc(µ) := sup

f ∈Lw(cid:18)Z f dµ − ρ(f )(cid:19) .

Theorem 4.3. Let φ : Pw → ¯R be a proper, convex and weakly lower semicontinuous
function. Then φ(µ) = φc(µ), ∀µ ∈ Pw.

Proof. By Proposition 4.2(iii), the weak convergence is equivalent to the convergence
in W1. This yields the closeness of the epigraph of φ under the metric W1 ∨ |·|. The
rest of the proof follows similarly by replacing L with Lw, which contains L .
