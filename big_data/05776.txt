The products of weak values of quantum observables are shown to be of value in deriving quantum uncertainty
and complementarity relations, for both weak and strong measurement statistics. First, a ‘product representation
formula’ allows the standard Heisenberg uncertainty relation to be derived from a classical uncertainty relation
for complex random variables. We show this formula also leads to strong uncertainty relations for unitary op-
erators, and underlies an interpretation of weak values as optimal (complex) estimates of quantum observables.
Furthermore, the two system observables that are weakly and strongly measured in a weak measurement con-
text are shown to obey a complementarity relation under the interchange of these observables, in the form of an
upper bound on the product of the corresponding weak values. Moreover, general tradeoff relations, between
weak purity, quantum purity and quantum incompatibility, and also between weak and strong joint probability
distributions, are obtained based on products of real and imaginary components of weak values, where these
relations quantify the degree to which weak probabilities can take anomalous values in a given context.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum theory has many counter intuitive features such
as wave-particle duality, interference, entanglement and non-
locality, and these features make the subject exciting even af-
ter ninety years since its initial formulation. To this weird
list, the weak value adds another twist making quantum the-
ory even more stranger than before. The concept of weak
value was introduced by Aharonov, Albert and Vaidman [1, 2]
while investigating the properties of a quantum system in pre
and post-selected ensembles. If a system is weakly coupled to
an apparatus, then upon post-selection of the system state, the
apparatus pointer observable is shifted on average by (the real
part of) a weak value [3].

The weak value can have strange properties. For exam-
ple, it is a complex number in general, and its real part can
take values outside the spectrum of the observable being mea-
sured. This is in sharp contrast to the average value of an ob-
servable when measured by a strong coupling to an apparatus,
which is always bounded by the smallest and largest eigenval-
ues. This gives rise to the notion of anomalous weak value
for an observable [1, 2], recently sharpened in [4]. The con-
cepts of weak measurements and weak values have since been
generalized in various directions [5–9] and have found numer-
ous applications [10–21]. However, while the separate real
and imaginary components of weak values have been given
various interpretations in the literature [20, 22–27], the weak
value itself as a complex number has not. This paper is in part
concerned with redressing this issue, via the consideration of
products of weak values.

It is well known that weak values respect sums, but not
products. That is, the weak value of the sum of two observ-
ables is just the sum of their weak values, whereas the weak

∗ akpati@hri.res.in

value of the product of the two observables is not equal to the
product of their weak values. The latter feature has been sug-
gested as underlying curious phenomena such as the quantum
Chesire cat, where one property of a quantum system, such as
its spin, appears to be spatially separated from another prop-
erty, such as its position [28–30]. Nevertheless, we show in
this paper that the products of weak values are well worth in-
vestigating, leading to a direct connection between quantum
and classical uncertainty relations, the interpretation of weak
values as optimal estimates, a form of complementarity for
weak measurement scenarios, and tradeoffs between the in-
compatibility of quantum observables and the purity of their
weak joint probability distribution.

We ﬁrst review and generalise a beautiful representation
theorem by Shikano and Hosoya in Sec. II.A, that directly
connects the average of the product of two quantum observ-
ables with the corresponding average product of their corre-
sponding weak values [9]. This is of direct operational sig-
niﬁcance in allowing the quantum average of any product to
be reconstructed from the weak values of the corresponding
observables, and in this sense weak values provide a hidden
variable model for the averages of a given set of quantum
observables and their products.
In Sec. II.B we show that
the representation formula provides a simple derivation of the
Heisenberg uncertainty relation. In fact, the latter may be rein-
terpreted as a classical dispersion relation for complex random
variables. We also use the representation formula to obtain a
strong uncertainty relation for unitary operators, with a simple
geometric interpretation. We further show in Sec. II.C that the
representation formula leads naturally to the interpretation of
a weak value as the optimal estimate of a given observable,
based on the measurement outcome of a second observable.
This interpretation is of particular interest in that makes no
reference to the decomposition of the weak value into real and
imaginary parts (nor to weak meaurements), unlike previous
connections between weak values and estimates [22, 23, 27].

We then consider various scenarios in which products of
weak values lead to physical implications that are not based
on the product representation formula. Thus, in Sec. III we
obtain a complementarity relation for the weak values of two
non-commuting projection operators, that restricts the degree
to which they can take anomalous values outside the interval
[0, 1]. In particular, it is possible to weakly measure the pro-
jection |a(cid:105)(cid:104)a| with postselection on projection |b(cid:105)(cid:104)b|, and vice
versa. We show that the product of the corresponding weak
values for these complementary scenarios is restricted to be
a positive real number, no greater than |(cid:104)a|b(cid:105)|2, with equality
for all pure initial states.

Further, in Sec. IV we obtain general tradeoff relations that
connect the weak joint probability distribution of two observ-
ables [27, 31] with their degree of incompatibility, and with
the corresponding strong joint probability distribution. It is
also shown that, despite weak probabilities having anomalous
values, the corresponding ‘weak purity’ cannot exceed unity.
Finally, conclusions are given in Sec. V.

II. UNCERTAINTY RELATIONS AND OPTIMAL
ESTIMATES FROM PRODUCTS OF WEAK VALUES

A. Representation of products

The weak value of a Hermitian operator A, for the pre-
selected state |ψ(cid:105) and the post-selected state |φ(cid:105), is deﬁned
by [1, 2]

(cid:104)φ|A|ψ(cid:105)
(cid:104)φ|ψ(cid:105) .

Aw(φ|ψ) :=

(1)
The real part of Aw(φ|ψ) corresponds to the average value of
a weak measurement carried out on |ψ(cid:105), when postselected on
the ﬁnal state |φ(cid:105) [3], although it may also be measured via
averages of suitable strong measurements [24]. The imagi-
nary part may similarly be measured via suitable weak and/or
strong measurements [24, 25]. The real and imaginary parts
can also be directly related to properties of optimal estimates
of A from strong measurements on state |ψ(cid:105) [22, 23, 27, 33],
and to measurement-induced disturbance [20, 26]. It follows,
therefore, that weak values have operational signiﬁcance in-
dependently of weak measurements per se.
More generally, the role of the postselected state |φ(cid:105) may
be replaced by the outcome of measuring some maximal pos-
itive operator valued measure (POVM) M ≡ {|m(cid:105)(cid:104)m|}, with

(cid:80)
m |m(cid:105)(cid:104)m| = ˆ1, leading to the expression
(cid:104)m|A|ψ(cid:105)
(cid:104)m|ψ(cid:105) ,

Aw(m|ψ) :=

(2)

for the weak value of A postselected on measurement outcome
M = m. Since the probability of measurement outcome m on
state |ψ(cid:105) is p(m|ψ) = |(cid:104)m|ψ(cid:105)|2, it immediately follows that
the average of the weak value, over all possible outcomes, is
given by [1, 2]
(cid:104)Aw(cid:105)p :=

p(m|ψ) Aw(m|ψ) = (cid:104)ψ|A|ψ(cid:105) =: (cid:104)A(cid:105)ψ,

(cid:88)

(3)

m

2
i.e, by the average value of A for state |ψ(cid:105). Note that this re-
construction formula holds for any maximal measurement M,
and also applies to non-Hermitian operators A via linearity.

Remarkably, the above reconstruction formula for the av-
erage of an observable may be extended to a similar formula
for products [9] (generalised here to arbitrary non-Hermitian

operators):(cid:88)

p(m|ψ) Aw(m|ψ)∗ Bw(m|ψ) = (cid:104)ψ|A†B|ψ(cid:105)

m

i.e.,

(cid:104)A∗

wBw(cid:105)p = (cid:104)A†B(cid:105)ψ,

(4)

as is readily checked by direct substitution. Thus, the aver-
age of an operator product, with respect to a quantum state
|ψ(cid:105), can be replaced by a average of a product of weak
values, with respect to the classical probability distribution
p(m|ψ). Note that this equation can alternatively be written
as a relation between quantum and classical inner products,
(Aw, Bw) = (A, B). Equation (4) reduces to Eq. (3) when
A = A† and B = ˆ1.

The product representation formula has a clear operational
signiﬁcance. For example, if the weak values of two Hermi-
tian operators A and B, postselected on measurement M, are
determined experimentally, then one can immediately recover
not only the averages of the observables A and B, but also
the averages of A2, B2, and AB—and, hence, the variances
and covariances of A and B [9]. One can also experimen-
tally recover the average of the operator (A − B)2 from the
weak values of A and B, where this average appears in various
error-disturbance and joint-measurement uncertainty relations
[23, 32–36].

We note from Eqs. (3) and (4) that weak values also pro-
vide a (complex) hidden variable model for the averages of a
given set of quantum observables and their pairwise products.
For example, the average values of all linear and quadratic
functions of the annihilation and creation operators a and a†
of a single mode ﬁeld, including the quadrature observable
Xθ = aeiθ + a†e−iθ and the number operator a†a, can be
modelled for any state |ψ(cid:105), via the corresponding weak values
aw(m|ψ) and a†
w(m|ψ) and classical probability distribution
p(m|ψ) (and for any choice of POVM M ≡ {|m(cid:105)(cid:104)m|}) [37].
We give two particular applications of the product represen-

tation formula in the following subsections.

B. Uncertainty relations from weak values

Complex random variables are standard tools in classical
signal processing and information theory [38, 39]. A com-
plex random variable α = α1 + iα2 is described by some real
and positive probability density p(α). The expectation value

of function f (α) is then given by (cid:104)f (α)(cid:105) :=(cid:82) dα p(α)f (α),

where the integral is over the complex plane with respect to
the uniform measure. A well known example in quantum me-
chanics is the outcome, α, of a balanced homodyne measure-
ment on a single-mode ﬁeld. This measurement is described

by the coherent state POVM {π−1|α(cid:105)(cid:104)α|}, with correspond-
ing probability density for ﬁeld state ρ given by the Husimi
Q-function p(α) = π−1(cid:104)α|ρ|α(cid:105) [40].

The variance of α is just the average mean square distance

between α and its mean value [38, 39], i.e.,

Var α := (cid:104)|α − (cid:104)α(cid:105)|2(cid:105) = (cid:104)|α|2(cid:105) − |(cid:104)α(cid:105)|2.

(5)

Similarly, the covariance of two such random variables, α and
β, with respect to a joint probability distribution p(α, β), is
deﬁned by
Cov(α, β) := (cid:104) (α − (cid:104)α(cid:105))∗(β − (cid:104)β(cid:105))(cid:105) = (cid:104) α∗β(cid:105) − (cid:104)α∗(cid:105)(cid:104)β(cid:105)
(6)

with (cid:104)f (α, β)(cid:105) := (cid:82) dαdβ p(α, β) f (α, β). Thus, Var α =

Cov(α, α), and one immediately has the classical uncertainty
relation [39]

Var α Var β ≥ |Cov(α, β)|2

(7)

from the Schwarz inequality for complex numbers. Choosing
α = Aw(m|ψ), β = Bw(m|ψ), and probability distribution
p(m|ψ), this classical uncertainty relation reduces to
VarpAw VarpBw ≥ |Covp(Aw, Bw)|2 .

(8)

for the case of weak values. We now apply this relation in two
scenarios of fundamental interest.

1. Heisenberg inequality as a classical uncertainty relation

The standard Heisenberg uncertainty relation [41–43] for
two non-commuting observables follows directly from the
product representation formula in Eq. (4) and the classical un-
certainty relation in Eq. (8). In particular, for the case of two
Hermitian operators A and B, substituting the ﬁrst equation
into the second and decomposing the right hand side into real
and imaginary parts yields

VarψA VarψB ≥ |(cid:104)AB(cid:105)ψ − (cid:104)A(cid:105)ψ(cid:104)B(cid:105)ψ|2

= Covψ(A, B)2 +

|(cid:104)[A, B](cid:105)ψ|2 ,

(9)

4

with the quantum covariance deﬁned by Covψ(A, B) :=
2(cid:104)AB + BA(cid:105)ψ − (cid:104)A(cid:105)ψ(cid:104)B(cid:105)ψ. This may be recognised as
1
Schr¨odinger’s strengthened form of the Heisenberg uncer-
tainty relation [44]. Thus, the standard quantum uncertainty
relation may be reinterpreted as a classical uncertainty rela-
tion for weak values.

It is a curious fact that one of the fundamental relations of
quantum mechanics, namely, the Heisenberg uncertainty rela-
tion, can be understood as a classical uncertainty relation for
complex random variables. In this sense the weak value ap-
proach removes the mystery associated with this uncertainty
relation. Recently, quantum uncertainty relations have been
proved [45] which go beyond the Robertson-Schr¨odinger un-
certainty relation. It may be interesting to explore if one can
view these also as classical uncertainty relations for weak val-
ues.

2. Uncertainty relations for unitary operators

It is straightforward to also obtain useful uncertainty rela-
tions for non-Hermitian operators. First, note that the variance
of a general operator is deﬁned by [46]

VarψA := (cid:104)A†A(cid:105)ψ − |(cid:104)A(cid:105)ψ|2 = VarpAw,

(10)

where the second equality follows from the product represen-
tation formula (4). This quantity has the desirable properties
of vanishing if and only if |ψ(cid:105) is an eigenstate of A, and of
reducing to the usual variance in the Hermitian case A = A†.
Thus, for example, recalling that the annihilation and cre-
ation operators a and a† of a single-mode bosonic ﬁeld satisfy
[a, a†] = 1, their variances are related by

Var a† = (cid:104)aa†(cid:105) − |(cid:104)a(cid:105)|2 = Var a + 1 ≥ 1,

(11)

implying immediately that a† has no eigenstates.

The classical uncertainty relation in Eq. (8) yields the gen-

eralisation

VarψA VarψB ≥ |Covp(Aw, Bw)|2

=(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:104)A†B(cid:105)ψ − (cid:104)A†(cid:105)ψ(cid:104)B(cid:105)ψ

(cid:12)(cid:12)2

(12)

of Eq. (9), to general operators A and B, where the second
line follows via the product representation formula (4) and
the deﬁnition in Eq. (6). This quantum uncertainty relation is
equivalent to Eq. (8) of Pati et al. [47], and again is seen to be
equivalent to a classical uncertainty relation for weak values.
As an application of the generalised uncertainty rela-
tion (12), consider the case of two unitary operators U and
V . Deﬁning

u := |(cid:104)U(cid:105)ψ|,

v := |(cid:104)V (cid:105)ψ|,

the variance of U is given by 1 − u2, in agreement with pre-
vious proposals in the literature [46–49], and substitution into
Eq. (12) yields

(1 − u2) (1 − v2) ≥(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:104)U†V (cid:105)ψ − (cid:104)U†(cid:105)ψ(cid:104)V (cid:105)ψ

(cid:12)(cid:12)2

≥(cid:12)(cid:12)|(cid:104)U†V (cid:105)ψ| − uv(cid:12)(cid:12)2

,

(13)

which may be rewritten as the uncertainty relation

u2 + v2 − 2uv|(cid:104)U†V (cid:105)ψ| ≤ 1 − |(cid:104)U†V (cid:105)ψ|2.

(14)
for two unitary operators. Note that |(cid:104)U†V (cid:105)ψ|2 is the overlap
of the states U|ψ(cid:105) and V |ψ(cid:105). Hence, the overlap plays a role
analogous to the commutator in the Heisenberg uncertainty
relation.

Zero uncertainties for U and V correspond to u = v = 1.

Noting that the weaker uncertainty relation

uv ≤ 1 + |(cid:104)U†V (cid:105)ψ|

(15)
follows directly from Eq. (14), using the inequality 2uv ≤
u2 + v2, it follows that zero uncertainties are possibly only in
the case of a unit overlap, |(cid:104)U†V (cid:105)ψ|2 = 1, as expected.

4

Uncertainty relation (17) yields an ellipse in the uv-plane,
similarly to the weaker relation in Eq. (14) (where the latter
corresponds to Φ = 0), but bounds a smaller region in the
positive uv-quadrant, as shown in Fig. 1. Note, however, that
the stronger relation requires further knowledge in addition to
the overlap of U and V for state |ψ(cid:105). This is analogous to the
strengthened Heisenberg inequality in Eq. (9), which requires
further knowledge in addition to the average commutator of A
and B for state |ψ(cid:105).
Finally, note that it is easy to extend the above uncertainty
relations to any density operator ρ, by replacing |ψ(cid:105) with a
puriﬁcation of ρ on a suitably extended Hilbert space. This
has the effect of replacing averages over |ψ(cid:105) with averages
over ρ in the above results.

C. Weak values as optimal estimates

We have shown that quantum uncertainty relations for the
variances of Hermitian and non-Hermitian operators corre-
spond to classical uncertainty relations for weak values. This
suggests that the ‘quantumness’ in these relations is modelled
by the assignment of a complex value Aw(m|ψ) to observable
A, for measurement outcome M = m on state |ψ(cid:105).

Here we show that this can be given a more precise sense:
the weak value Aw(m) in Eq. (2) may be interpreted as
the best possible estimate of A, from measurement outcome
M = m on state |ψ(cid:105), provided that complex numbers are per-
mitted as estimates (as is the case, for example, in balanced
homodyne detection, where one estimates a via the complex
outcomes of the coherent state POVM {π−1|α(cid:105)(cid:104)α|} [40]).

Aest := (cid:80)

For simplicity we will restrict attention to the case that M
corresponds to a Hermitian operator. Any estimate A = αm
from outcome M = m then corresponds to measurement of
m αm |m(cid:105)(cid:104)m|. The weak value of Aest for out-
w (m|ψ) = αm, using Eq. (2). Now,
come m follows as Aest
one possible measure of the degree to which Aest provides a
‘good’ estimate of A is the average value of |A − Aest|2 [52].
Thus, we deﬁne the mean square deviation of the estimate by
2 := (cid:104)|A − Aest|2(cid:105)ψ = (cid:104)|Aw − Aest

w |2(cid:105)p

(cid:88)

m

=

p(m|ψ) |(Aw(m|ψ) − αm)|2 ,
(18)

where the equality in the ﬁrst line follows from the product
representation formula in Eq. (4). This quantity is nonnega-
tive, and clearly vanishes if and only if the optimal estimate

m := Aw(m|ψ).
αopt

(19)

is made. Thus the best possible estimate of A is its weak
value, as claimed.

The above result is of interest in providing an interpretation
of the weak value that does not rely on decomposing it into
real and imaginary parts, and which is, moreover, independent
of the concept of weak measurements.
It may be regarded
as a generalisation of the case where the optimal estimate is
constrained to be a real number (in which case the optimal

FIG. 1. (color online). Uncertainty relations for unitary operators.
The uncertainty relation in Eq. (14) is depicted for an overlap of 1/4,
and restricts u and v to lie in the intersection of an ellipse with the
positive quadrant (purple region). The corresponding weaker uncer-
tainty relation in Eq. (15) is also shown, corresponding to the region
below a hyperbola that is tangent to the ellipse (solid red curve). Fi-
nally, the stronger uncertainty relation in Eq. (17) is depicted for the
case Φ = π, and constrains u and v to lie in the elliptical region
below the dashed blue curve.

1 − |(cid:104)U†V (cid:105)ψ| ≤ 1

(16)

Hence, the uncertainty relation constrains u and v to lie within
an ellipse oriented diagonally in the uv-plane, determined by
the overlap of U|ψ(cid:105) and V |ψ(cid:105), as depicted in Fig. 1. Note that
the area of this ellipse is proportional to the square root of 1−
|(cid:104)U†V (cid:105)ψ|2, and hence the uncertainty relation becomes more
constraining as the overlap increases. The weaker uncertainty
relation in Eq. (15) is also depicted in Fig. 1.

Similar elliptical constraints for u and v have been ob-
tained previously by Massar and Spindel for the special case
U V = eiφV U [48] (see also [50]). A circular constraint for
the general case has been recently obtained by Bagchi and Pati
[49], which is typically tighter than that given in Ref. [48].
We can obtain an even stronger constraint by proceeding di-
rectly from the ﬁrst inequality in Eq. (13) above, to obtain the
stronger uncertainty relation (see also Eq. (4) of Ref. [49])

u2 + v2 − 2uv|(cid:104)U†V (cid:105)ψ| cos Φ ≤ 1 − |(cid:104)U†V (cid:105)ψ|2.

Here Φ denotes
the complex number

ant associated with |ψ(cid:105), U|ψ(cid:105) and V |ψ(cid:105) [49, 51].

the phase of

0.20.40.60.81.0u0.20.40.60.81.0v5

similar deﬁnitions hold for the other projector Πb. This shows
that the weak values of these projectors can be large, and lie
outside the eigenvalue range [0, 1] of the projectors. However,
both weak values cannot be large at the same time. Indeed,
using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we see that the product
of these weak values satisﬁes

w(b|ψ) Bb
Aa

w(a|ψ) = |(cid:104)a|b(cid:105)|2 ≤ 1.

(24)

Thus, even though individually each of these weak values can
be complex, with arbitrarily large moduluses, their product
is real, independent of the pre-selected state, and bounded by
unity. This represents a new kind of complementarity between
the weak and strong components of quantum weak measure-
ments.

A similar complementarity also holds for the scenario of a
weak momentum measurement postselected on the result of
a strong position measurement, and its converse. In this case
the corresponding weak values for state |ψ(cid:105) are given by

w(x|ψ) =
P p

and it is easily checked that the product of these two weak
values satisfy the condition

w(p|ψ) P p

w(x|ψ) =

2π .

(26)

Thus,
the complementarity of weak values of two non-
commuting projectors is a general feature of quantum sys-
tems, that holds in both ﬁnite and inﬁnite dimensions.

Finally, we note that it is straightforward to generalise the
above complementarity relations to density operators. In par-
ticular, recalling that the weak value of observable A for den-
sity operator ρ postselected on POVM M ≡ {Mm} is given
by [23, 27]

III. COMPLEMENTARITY OF WEAK VALUES

In quantum theory complementarity imposes limitations on
our ability to display two mutually exclusive properties of a
quantum system at the same time. The principle of comple-
mentarity for the wave-particle duality as formulated by Bohr
is a famous example of this. In the context of weak measure-
ments, it is possible that one can probe two complementary as-
pects of a quantum system at some price (for e.g. introducing
more noise) as the apparatus interacts with the system weakly
allowing a gentle observation without disturbing the system
too much. However, it turns out that there is a strong comple-
mentarity between the weak and the strong components of the
weak measurement.

We consider the case of weak measurements involving pro-

jection operators

(20)

Aa = |a(cid:105)(cid:104)a|,

Bb = |b(cid:105)(cid:104)b|,

a aAa and B =(cid:80)

degenerate observables A =(cid:80)

corresponding to the eigenvalue decompositions of two non-
b bBb. For
a given initial state |ψ(cid:105) there are then two complementary
weak measurement scenarios: a weak measurement of pro-
jector Aa postselected on state |b(cid:105), i.e, on B = b, and a weak
measurement of projector Bb postselected on state |a(cid:105), i.e., on
A = a. The corresponding weak values follow from either of
Eqs. (1) and (2) as

w(b|ψ) =
Aa

(cid:104)b|a(cid:105)(cid:104)a|ψ(cid:105)

(cid:104)b|ψ(cid:105)

, Bb

w(a|ψ) =

(cid:104)a|b(cid:105)(cid:104)b|ψ(cid:105)

(cid:104)a|ψ(cid:105)

.

(21)

We see that the weak values connect wavefunctions directly

in complementary bases. For example, we have
w(b|ψ) ψ(b) = (cid:104)b|a(cid:105) ψ(a),
Aa
w(a|ψ) ψ(a) = (cid:104)a|b(cid:105) ψ(b),
Bb

where ψ(a) and ψ(b) are the wavefunctions in the eigenbasis
representations of A and B, respectively. The interesting point
to note here is ψ(a) and ψ(b) are directly related without a
unitary transformation:
the weak values act as ‘ﬁlters’ that
connect two complementary aspects directly.

Next, we ask can these two weak values be arbitrarily large
at the same time? Strangely, not. First, note that the weak
values for the projectors Aa and Bb can be expressed as the
sum of the average of the projectors in the state |ψ(cid:105) plus an
anomalous part [4]

w(b|ψ) = (cid:104)Aa(cid:105)ψ + ∆ψAa (cid:104)b| ¯ψa(cid:105)
(cid:104)b|ψ(cid:105) ,
w(a|ψ) = (cid:104)Bb(cid:105)ψ + ∆ψBb (cid:104)a| ¯ψb(cid:105)
(cid:104)a|ψ(cid:105) ,

Aa

Bb

where the ﬁrst inequality follows from the Schwarz inequality.
Thus, the product is again a positive real number, and one ob-
tains a simple generalisation of the complementarity relation
in Eq. (24).

In the next section, we make more precise the notion of
complementarity, by making connections to weak probabili-
ties, weak purity and incompatibility.

(23)

IV. WEAK PROBABILITIES AND INCOMPATIBILITY

where ∆ψAa := (VarψAa)1/2 is the uncertainty of the pro-
jector in the state |ψ(cid:105), | ¯ψa(cid:105) is a state orthogonal to |ψ(cid:105), and

In the previous sections we have adressed the signiﬁcance
and applications of products of complex weak values. Here

we focus on products related to their real and imaginary com-
ponents. In particular, we give natural and logically indepen-
dent deﬁnitions of the weak purity and the incompatibility
of observables, in Secs. IV.A and IV.B, and then show that
these satisfy a number of tradeoff relations, related to proper-
ties of quantum purities and strong probability distributions,
in Secs. IV.C and IV.D.

A. Weak joint probabilities and weak purity

The weak values Aa(b|ψ) and Aa

w(a|ρ) in Eqs. (21) and
(28), for the projection operator Aa postselected on measure-
ment result B = b, are sometimes referred to as ‘weak proba-
bilities’ [16, 17, 53]. However, here we will follow the com-
mon practice of identifying the real part of this quantity as a
weak probability [24, 27, 31, 33, 54, 55]. More generally, for
two arbitrary POVM observables A ≡ {Aa} and B ≡ {Bb}
we deﬁne the weak conditional probability of A = a postse-
lected on outcome B = b by

pw(a|b) := Re

.

(29)

(cid:110) Tr[ρAaBb]

(cid:111)

Tr[ρBb]

Note that it is not assumed that Aa and Bb are rank-1 pro-
jection operators, in contrast to Aa and Bb of the previous
section.

The weak conditional probability distribution is physically
measurable via suitable weak measurements, as is the correp-
sonding weak joint probability distribution [27, 31, 33, 54]

pw(a, b) := pw(a|b) p(b) = 1

Here p(b) := Tr(cid:2)ρBb(cid:3) is the probability of measurement out-

2(cid:104)AaBb + BbAa(cid:105)ρ,

(30)

come B = b. The weak joint probability distribution may also
be recognised as the Margeneau-Hill quasiprobability distri-
bution [56], and satisﬁes

(cid:88)

pw(a, b) = p(a),

pw(a, b) = p(b),

b

a

just as for classical joint distributions. However, the weak
joint probabilities pw(a, b) can take anomalous values, lying
outside the unit interval [0, 1].

In particular, at least one value of pw(a, b) is anomalous if

and only if

|pw(a, b)| > 1,

(31)

(cid:88)

a,b

(cid:88)

which is equivalent to at least one value being negative.
Clearly, a sufﬁcient condition for an anomalous value is then
that

PW :=

pw(a, b)2 > 1,

(32)

a,b

where PW will be called the weak purity of pw(a, b) in anal-
ogy to classical and quantum purities. Surprisingly, however,
it will be shown further below that this condition is never sat-
isﬁed! That is, while individual weak probabilities can be neg-
ative, the weak purity is always bounded by unity, just as for
classical distributions. This property turns out to be closely re-
lated to limits on the incompatibility of quantum observables.

(cid:88)

B.

Incompatibility

6

A natural measure of the incompatibility between two
POVM elements Aa and Bb in a quantum state ρ is given by

I(a, b) :=

|(cid:104)[Aa, Bb](cid:105)ρ|2 ≥ 0.

1
4

(33)

Note that I(a, b) vanishes if and only if [Aa, Bb]ρ = 0. It
follows from a result of Busch [57] that if one of Aa and Bb
is a projector, then I(a, b) = 0 is equivalent to pw(a, b) ≥ 0.
Thus there is a connection between anomalous weak proba-
bilities and incompatibility, which will be sharpened further
below.

The incompatibility of two measurements A and B is nat-
urally deﬁned as the total incompatibility of their POVM ele-
ments, i.e.,

I(A, B) :=

I(a, b).

(34)

a,b

Note that this measure is independent of the particular values
assigned to the outcomes of A and B, and hence characterises
incompatibility in an invariant manner. The incompatibility
ranges between 0 and 1, i.e.,

0 ≤ I(A, B) ≤ 1.

(35)
The lower bound is is reached if and only and if [Aa, Bb]ρ = 0
for all a and b. To demonstrate the upper bound, note that

(cid:88)

(cid:104)

I(a, b) = (Im{Tr [ρAaBb]})2

(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2
≤(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Tr
≤ Tr(cid:2)ρ(Aa)2(cid:3) Tr(cid:2)ρ(Bb)2(cid:3)

(Bbρ1/2) (ρ1/2Aa)

≤ Tr [ρAa] Tr [ρBb]
= p(a) p(b),

(36)
where the Schwarz inequality and 0 ≤ Aa, Bb ≤ 1 have
been used. Summing over a and b yields the desired result.
Stronger upper bounds, involving the weak purity and the
quantum purity, are given below.

C. Tradeoff relations for purity and incompatibility

To connect the ideas of the previous two subsections, and
also relate them to results of section III, note that one has the
relation

pw(a, b)2 + I(a, b) = |Tr [ρAaBb]|2.

(37)
Upper bounding the right hand side yields a number of inter-
esting results which we explore below.

1. Pure states and nondegenerate observables

First, consider the special case of a pure state and nonde-

generate (or maximal) observables, i.e.,

ρ = |ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ|, Aa = |a(cid:105)(cid:104)a|, Bb = |b(cid:105)(cid:104)b|.

when some of the weak probabilities are negative, thus re-
stricting the degree to which the weak probabilities can take
anomalous values. Second, the greater the incompatibility of
A and B, the smaller the weak purity, and vice versa. Third,
the incompatibility of A and B is upper-bounded by the dif-
ference between the quantum purity and the weak purity. This
difference can, therefore, be considered a resource for incom-
patibility, analogous to the manner in which the difference be-
tween a quantum purity and a classical purity acts as a re-
source for quantum coherence [59].

Finally, note that an alternative application of the Schwarz

inequality in the general case yields

(cid:104)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Tr

|Tr [ρAaBb]|2 =

(Bbρ1/2)(ρ1/2Aa)

≤ (cid:104)(Bb)2(cid:105)ρ (cid:104)(Aa)2(cid:105)ρ
≤ (cid:104)Aa(cid:105)ρ (cid:104)Bb(cid:105)ρ,

(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

7

(45)
(46)

(47)

(48)

Here the states {|a(cid:105)} and {|b(cid:105)} are not assumed to be or-
thonormal. Equation (37) then simpliﬁes to

pw(a, b)2 + I(a, b) = |(cid:104)a|b(cid:105)|2 p(a) p(b).

(38)

It may be shown, via Eqs.(29), (30) and (33), that this is equiv-
alent to the equality in the complementarity relation Eq. (24).
Thus, the latter relation may also be interpreted as relating
weak joint probabilities and incompatibility. Further, from
Eq. (30) and recalling I(a, b) ≥ 0, one has the weaker com-
plementarity relation

pw(a|b) pw(b|a) ≤ |(cid:104)a|b(cid:105)|2 ≤ 1,

(39)

relating weak probabilities for a weak measurement of A post-
selected on a strong measurement of B and vice versa. Thus,
if the weak probability of A = a, postselected on B = b,
is greater than 1, then the converse weak probability must be
less than 1.

Summing Eq. (38) over a and b yields the tradeoff relation

PW + I(A, B) ≤ cAB := max

a,b

|(cid:104)a|b(cid:105)|2 ≤ 1,

(40)

between the weak purity and the total incompatibility of A and
B. Note that the maximum overlap of the POVM elements,
cAB, commonly appears in entropic uncertainty relations [58].
This relation provides a far stronger upper bound for I(A, B)
than does Eq. (35), and will be discussed further below in its
more general form.

Substitution into Eq. (37) then gives

pw(a, b)2 + I(a, b) ≤ p(a) p(b),

leading immediately to the generalisation,
pw(a|b) pw(b|a) ≤ 1

of the complementarity relation in Eq. (39), to arbitrary den-
sity operators and observables.

2. General tradeoff relations

D. Weak probabilities vs strong probabilities

For the general case of arbitrary states and observables, one

has from the Schwarz inequality that

(41)
where the ﬁnal inequality makes use of the property 0 ≤
Aa, Bb ≤ 1. Substitution into Eq. (37) then gives

|Tr [ρAaBb]|2 = |Tr [ρ(AaBb)]|2

≤ Tr(cid:2)ρ2(cid:3) Tr(cid:2)(Aa)2(Bb)2(cid:3)
≤ Tr(cid:2)ρ2(cid:3) Tr [AaBb] ,
pw(a, b)2 + I(a, b) ≤ Tr(cid:2)ρ2(cid:3) Tr [AaBb] ,
PW + I(A, B) ≤ Tr(cid:2)ρ2(cid:3) =: PQ,

and summation over a and b yields the tradeoff relation

(42)

(43)

where PQ denotes the quantum purity. It also follows, recall-
ing I(A, B) ≥ 0, that

Weak measurements are considered to be ‘weak’ because
they involve a weak interaction between the system and an ap-
paratus. Here we demonstrate a connection between the statis-
tics of weak and strong measurements that yields a different
sense of ‘weakness’ for weak measurements: anomalous val-
ues of weak joint probabilities are restricted by the values of
corresponding strong joint probabilities.

In particular, taking A and B to be projective measurements

for simplicity, the Schwarz inequality yields

(cid:104)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Tr

(cid:105)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

|Tr [ρAaBb]|2 =

ρ1/2(ρ1/2AaBb)

≤ Tr [AaρAaBb] =: ps(a, b).

The quantity ps(a, b) may be recognised as the joint probabil-
ity of outcomes A = a and B = b, for the scenario in which
a strong measurement of A is followed by a strong measure-
ment of B. Substitution into Eq. (37) then gives the fascinat-
ing connection

PW ≤ PQ,

(44)

pw(a, b)2 + I(a, b) ≤ ps(a, b),

(49)

i.e., the weak purity can never exceed the quantum purity.

The tradeoff relation in Eq. (43) generalises Eq. (40) to all
states and observables, and has several physical implications.
First, as discussed in the previous section, the weak purity
is never greater than the classical maximum value of 1, even

linking weak probabilities, strong probabilities, and incom-
patibility.

For example, we have from Eq. (49) that

|pw(a, b)| ≤(cid:112)ps(a, b) ≤ 1.

(50)

Hence, individual weak joint probabilities are bounded in
modulus by the square root of a classical probability. Noting
Eq. (31), this yields the necessary condition

(cid:88)

(cid:112)ps(a, b) > 1

(51)

a,b

on strong probabilities for the existence of anomalous weak
probabilities.

As a second example, note from Eq. (49) that

I(a, b) ≤ ps(a, b),

(52)

i.e., the statistics of two successive strong projective measure-
ments bound the incompatibility of the corresponding mea-
surement outcomes. Generalizations of these results can ob-
tained for non-projective measurements, but will not be con-
sidered here.

to derive strong uncertainty relations for pairs of unitary oper-
ators; and to obtain an interpretation of weak values as optimal
estimates. Further, for two complementary weak measure-
ment scenarios, in which the weakly and strongly measured
observables are interchanged, there is a complementarity rela-
tion in the form of an upper bound on the product of the cor-
responding weak values. Finally, general trade-off relations
have been obtained between weak purities, quantum purities
and the degree of incompatibility of two observables, and also
between the corresponding weak and strong joint probabil-
ity distributions, which quantify the extent to which weak
probabilities can take anomalous values. We hope that our
results will open up new ways of thinking about uncertainty
and complementarity relations using products of weak values.
In future, it may be worth exploring if the complex random
variable model and the product representation formula for the
weak value can reproduce the nonlocal correlations of entan-
gled states.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that the products of weak values of quan-
tum observables have many physical applications. For exam-
ple, a product representation formula can be used to recover
quantum averages of products of observables from experimen-
tally determined weak values of the observables; to show that
the standard Heisenberg uncertainty relation is equivalent to
a classical uncertainty relation for complex random variables;
