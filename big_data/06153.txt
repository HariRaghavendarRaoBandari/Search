Rotational invariance conditions in elasticity, gradient elasticity and

its connection to isotropy

Ingo M¨unch1 and Patrizio Neﬀ2

March 22, 2016

Abstract

For homogeneous higher gradient elasticity models we discuss frame-indiﬀerence and isotropy require-
ments. To this end, we introduce the notions of local versus global SO(3)-invariance and identify frame-
indiﬀerence (traditionally) with global left SO(3)-invariance and isotropy with global right SO(3)-invariance.
For speciﬁc restricted representations, the energy may also be local left SO(3)-invariant as well as local right
SO(3)-invariant. Then we turn to linear models and consider a consequence of frame-indiﬀerence together
with isotropy in nonlinear elasticity and apply this joint invariance condition to some speciﬁc linear models.
The interesting point is the appearance of ﬁnite rotations in transformations of a geometrically linear model.
It is shown that when starting with a linear model deﬁned already in the inﬁnitesimal symmetric strain
ε = sym Grad[u], the new invariance condition is equivalent to isotropy of the linear formulation. Therefore,
it may be used also in higher gradient elasticity models for a simple check of isotropy and for extensions to
anisotropy. In this respect we consider in more detail variational formulations of the linear indeterminate
couple stress model, a new variant of it with symmetric force stresses and general linear gradient elasticity.

Introduction

This paper is motivated by our endeavour to better understand isotropy conditions in higher gradient elasticity
theories. Therefore, we make use of the old idea expressed by Truesdell [52, Lecture 6] albeit including higher
gradient continua.1 To this end we reconsider frame-indiﬀerence and isotropy ﬁrst in nonlinear elasticity and
then in classical linear elasticity theories. These investigations are extended to linear higher gradient elasticity
with a focus on the indeterminate couple stress theory. We do not discuss general material symmetry conditions
a la Noll’s group theoretic framework, as e.g. presented in [10, 48].

In nonlinear elasticity, isotropy requirements are fundamentally diﬀerent from frame-indiﬀerence require-
ments. Indeed, isotropy rotates the referential coordinate system, while frame-indiﬀerence rotates the spatial
coordinate system. Both spaces, referential and spatial, are clearly independent of each other and the corre-
sponding rotations of frames are not connected to each other.

1Truesdell writes [52, Lecture 6]: ”In the older literature a material is said to be ”isotropic” if it is ”unaﬀected by rotations.”
This means that if we ﬁrst rotate a specimen of material and then do an experiment upon it, the outcome is the same as if the
specimen had not been rotated. In other words, within the class of eﬀects considered by the theory, [referential] rotations cannot
be detected by any experiment. The response of the material with respect to the reference conﬁguration κ is the same as that with
respect to any other obtained from it by rotation.”

In this paper, however, we will later apply the same rotation to the referential and spatial frame simulta-
neously. It is clear that this is not equivalent to frame-indiﬀerence or isotropy as we show with simple explicit
examples. What, then, is the use of such a speciﬁc transformation (which we will call the ♯-transformation in
Section 4). Indeed, once we consider reduced energy expressions which already encode frame-indiﬀerence, then
applying the ♯-transformation and requiring form-invariance of the energy under this transformation is equiva-
lent to isotropy. Surprisingly, the ♯-transformation remains operative in exactly the same way when applying
it to the geometrically linear context. It is this insight that we follow when discussing isotropy conditions for
higher gradient continua. We do not believe that our development leads to new results for the representation of
isotropic formulations,2 but we believe that there is a conceptual gain of understanding when working directly
with transformation connected to ﬁnite rotations.
In this respect we remind the reader that for linearized
frame-indiﬀerence it would be suﬃcient to work with the Lie-algebra of skew-symmetric rotations instead of the
orthogonal group. This is, however, not possible with respect to isotropy considerations.

Further, we give a contribution to the discussion in [31], where a fundamental aspect of strain gradient elas-
ticity as proposed by Mindlin [35] is doubted. There we read: ”However, the approach described by equation
(1) includes a serious ﬂaw:3 Couple stresses are components of a tensor which has a rank higher than two. In
conclusion, the torque arising from an asymmetric stress tensor cannot consequently be compensated by the
torque associated with a tensor of higher rank. In fact, there are diﬀerent transformation rules for tensors of
diﬀerent rank during rotation of a coordinate system. Therefore, couple stress theory does not consequently
fulﬁll the requirement of invariance with respect to rotation of the coordinate system. In spite of this deﬁciency,
strain gradient theory still contains important aspects which are corrected.” Motivated by this statement we
show to the contrary that all proper invariance requirements are satisﬁed.

The paper is now structured as follows. After notational agreements we recall the gradient of continuum
rotation, which is the curvature measure in linear couple stress-elasticity.
Identities from the scalar triple
product built a basis to study transformation rules for this curvature measure later in the text. In Section 2 we
start our investigation in the context of nonlinear hyperelasticity by discussing frame-indiﬀerence and isotropy
for ﬁrst and second gradient continua. Then we consider the simultaneous transformation of the deformation to
new spatial and referential coordinates. The consequence of this transformation in linearized elasticity follows in
Section 3. Further, we prepare for higher gradient elasticity by giving details on transformation rules and apply
them to the linear momentum balance equations of several models in Section 4. We then deﬁne form-invariance
in higher gradient elasticity in Section 5 and specify our result for several couple stress theories in Section 6.
Finally, we conclude and give an outlook.

1.1 Notational agreements and preliminary results
By R3×3 we denote the set of real 3 × 3 second order tensors, written with capital letters. Vectors in R3 are
denoted by small letters. Additionally, tensors in R3×3×3 are necessary for our discussion, where signiﬁcant
symbols like ǫ, m, and n will be used. The components of vectors and tensors are given according to orthogonal
unit vectors e1, e2, e3, which may be rotated by Q ∈ SO(3). Throughout this paper Latin subscripts specify
the direction of components in index notation and take the values 1, 2, 3. For repeating subscripts Einstein’s
summation convention applies.

We adopt the usual abbreviations of Lie-algebra theory, i.e., so(3) := {X ∈ R3×3 |X T = −X} is the Lie-
algebra of skew symmetric tensors and sl(3) := {X ∈ R3×3 | tr(X) = 0} is the Lie-algebra of traceless tensors.
For all X ∈ R3×3 we set sym X = 1
2 (X − X T ) ∈ so(3) and the deviatoric part
dev X = X − 1

3 tr(X) 1 ∈ sl(3) and we have the orthogonal Cartan-decomposition of the Lie-algebra gl(3)

2 (X T + X) ∈ Sym(3), skew X = 1

gl(3) = {sl(3) ∩ Sym(3)} ⊕ so(3) ⊕ R· 1 ,

X = dev sym X + skew X +

Here, m is the second-order couple stress tensor and σ21 − σ12 = 2 axl( skeweσ) represents the skew-symmetric part of the total
force stress tensor eσ. The equation is given for the planar situation, see also eq.(6.11).

In index notation the typical conventions for diﬀerential operations are implied such as comma followed by a
subscript to denote the partial derivative with respect to the corresponding coordinate. The gradient of a scalar
ﬁeld φ ∈ R and the gradient of a vector ﬁeld b ∈ R3 are given by

For vectors a, b ∈ R3 we let

denote the inner and outer product on R3 with associated vector norm kak2
inner product on R3×3 is given by

R3 = ha, aiR3. The standard Euclidean

(1.9)

hX, Y iR3×3 = Xij Yij

∈ R ,

(1.10)

and thus the Frobenius tensor norm is kXk2 = hX, XiR3×3. Similarly, on R3×3×3 we consider the inner product
(1.11)

hm, niR3×3×3 = mijk nijk

∈ R ,

and the tensor norm kmk2
R3×3×3 = hm, miR3×3×3 . The identity tensor on R3×3 will be denoted by 1 = δij ei ⊗ ej,
so that tr(X) = hX, 1iR3×3 = Xij δij = Xii and hX, Y iR3×3 = tr(X Y T ). Further, we will make repeated use of
the identity tr[X Y Z] = hX Y Z, 1i = hY, X T Zi. The divergence of a vector ﬁeld v reads:

divxv := tr(Gradx[v]) = hGradx[v], 1i = vi,j δij = vi,i ∈ R .

(1.12)

Note that we do not introduce symbolic notation for the double contraction or more complicated contractions
for higher order tensors, since this may be confusing and also limited for certain cases. Instead, we use generally

4

index notation for contractions being not deﬁned by the scalar product. Thus, the divergence of a second order
tensor is given by

DivxY := (GRAD[Y ])ijk δjk ei = Yij,j ei ∈ R3 .

Similarly, the divergence of a third order tensor reads

DIVxm := mijk,k ei ⊗ ej

∈ R3×3 .

The curl of a vector v is given by

curlxv := −va,b ǫabi ei ∈ R3 .
Similarly, the Curl of a second order tensor ﬁeld X ∈ R3×3 is deﬁned by

In this work we consider a body which occupies a bounded open set Ω ⊆ R3 of the three-dimensional Euclidian
space R3 and assume that its boundary ∂Ω is a piecewise smooth surface. An elastic material ﬁlls the domain
Ω ⊂ R3 and we refer the motion of the body to the displacement ﬁeld u(x) : Ω ⊆ R3 7→ R3 shifting any point x
of the reference conﬁguration to the actual conﬁguration x + u(x).

Since the gradient of a scalar φ is curl-free

curlxgradx[φ] = curlx[φ,i ei] = −φ,ij ǫijk ek

= −(φ,12 − φ,21) e3 − (φ,23 − φ,32) e1 − (φ,31 − φ,13) e2 = 0 ,

the deﬁnition in eq.(1.16) is such that the gradient of a vector ﬁeld u is also curl-free:

CurlxGradx[u] = Curlx[ui,j ei ⊗ ej] = −ui,jb ǫjbk ei ⊗ ek

= −(ui,12 − ui,21) ei ⊗ e3 − (ui,23 − ui,32) ei ⊗ e1 − (ui,31 − ui,13) ei ⊗ e2 = 0 .

However, the skew-symmetric part of the gradient of a vector ﬁeld u is generally not curl-free:

The representations ofek(x) with the skew-symmetric gradient in eq.(1.22) on the one hand, and the symmetric

gradient in eq.(1.23) on the other hand seems amazing. For the proof of relation (1.23) we use eq.(1.19), (1.20),
and X = sym X + skew X to obtain the above statement:

ek(x) = (Curlx sym Gradx[u(x)])T .

1.2

Identities from the Levi-Civita tensor

In section 1.1 we have used the baseless permutation ǫijk to deﬁne some functions. Therefore, the base of the
functions argument yields the base of the function automatically. On the one hand, this is convenient but on
the other hand not suﬃciently precise to investigate some transformation rules to be considered in section 4.
Thus, we make use of the third order Levi-Civita tensor

ǫ := hei, ej × eki ei ⊗ ej ⊗ ek = ǫijk ei ⊗ ej ⊗ ek

∈ R3×3×3 .

(1.26)

The components of the Levi-Civita tensor are the scalar triple product of an orthogonal unit base, which may
be rotated. Therefore, let Q be a constant rotation tensor with QT Q = Q QT = 1 and det Q = +1, mapping
the orthogonal referential system of Euclidean vectors ei to a rotated system di via

di = Q ei ,

Q = di ⊗ ei ,

Qia = hdi, eai = hea, dii ,

i = 1, 2, 3 ,

a = 1, 2, 3 .

(1.27)

Note that the components Qia are deﬁned by the commutative inner product. However, the rotation tensor Q
is generally not symmetric: Q 6= QT . Since the referential basis vectors ei are considered to be orthogonal and
of unit length the rotated basis vectors di are orthogonal and of unit length as well:

hdi, dji = hQia ea, Qjb ebi = Qia Qjb δab = Qia Qja = Qia QT

aj = δij .

(1.28)

Thus, the Levi-Civita tensor ǫ = ǫ♯

ǫ♯
ijk = hdi, dj × dki = hQia ea, Qjb eb × Qkc eci = Qia Qjb Qkc hei, ej × eki = Qia Qjb Qkc ǫabc .

ijk di ⊗ dj ⊗ dk can be written in terms of the rotated base with components
(1.29)

Since the scalar triple product does not depend on the direction of the orthogonal unit base, the components of
the Levi-Civita tensor are independent concerning the direction of the orthogonal unit base4 in R3×3×3. Thus,
the Levi-Civita tensor is an isotropic tensor of order 3 with respect to proper orthogonal transformations, which
is reading ǫ♯

ijk = ǫijk in eq.(1.29), and yielding the identity

ǫijk = Qia Qjb Qkc ǫabc .

(1.30)

Since the symbolic notation of tensor products is only established in R3×3 we prescind from deﬁning a new kind
of simple contraction. This would be necessary to switch from index to symbolic notation in eq.(1.30), where

4This is similar to the identity tensor 1 ∈ R3×3. Its components are independent concerning the direction of the orthogonal

unit base.

6

each rotation tensor Q has one simple contraction with the corresponding index of the permutation.5 Since the
rotation Q in eq.(1.30) is arbitrary, the identity must also hold for the transposed of Q, which is also in SO(3).
Thus, a similar identity to eq.(1.30) is easily deduced:

Another identity can be found via simple contraction of Q and the Levi-Civita tensor, which is considered in
the basis ei on the left hand side and by the basis di on the right hand side:

ǫijk = Qai Qbj Qck ǫabc .

2 Objectivity and isotropy in nonlinear elasticity

2.1 Objectivity and isotropy in nonlinear elasticity - the local case

In geometrically nonlinear hyperelasticity we know that frame-indiﬀerence is left-invariance of the energy under
SO(3)-action and isotropy is right-invariance under SO(3), i.e.6 for the energy density W we have

frame − indiﬀerence :
isotropy :

W (Q1 F ) = W (F )
W (F Q2) = W (F )

∀ Q1 ∈ SO(3) ,
∀ Q2 ∈ SO(3) .

Therefore, by specifying Q2 = QT

1 we obtain also the necessary invariance condition

W (Q F QT ) = W (F )

∀ Q ∈ SO(3) .

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

Note that condition (2.3) does not imply objectivity, as can be seen from considering the energy expressions

W (F ) = k F − 1k2 6= k Q F − 1k2 = W (Q F ) ,
W (F ) = k sym(F − 1)k2 6= k sym(Q F − 1)k2 = W (Q F ) ,

(2.4)

satisfying (2.3) but not being frame-indiﬀerent [18]. With the same example one sees that condition (2.3) does
not imply isotropy. Therefore, applying the transformation F 7→ Q F QT (i.e. the ♯-transformation deﬁned in
eq.(2.9)) has no intrinsic meaning in nonlinear elasticity theory as such.

It is clear that every frame-indiﬀerent elastic energy W can be expressed in the right Cauchy-Green tensor
C = F T F in the sense that there is a function Ψ : Sym+(3) 7→ R such that ∀ F ∈ R3×3

W (F ) = Ψ(F T F ) .

(2.5)

Of course, any W of the form (2.5) is automatically frame-indiﬀerent. Applying the isotropy condition (2.2) to
the representation in eq. (2.5) we must have

W (F Q) = W (F ) ⇔ Ψ(QT F T F Q) = W (F Q) = W (F ) = Ψ(F T F )

∀ Q ∈ SO(3) .

(2.6)

5The simple contraction concerning the index b in eq.(1.30) is not possible via standard symbolic notation.
6We do not discuss O(3)-invariance for simplicity.

7

Therefore, for reduced energy expressions (2.5) the isotropy requirement can be equivalently stated as

Ψ(Q C QT ) = Ψ(C)

∀ Q ∈ SO(3) .

(2.7)

In eq.(2.7) we see that isotropy is invariance of the function Ψ under simultaneous spatial and referential
rotation of the coordinate system with the same rotation Q by interpreting the Cauchy-Green tensor C as a
linear mapping C : R3 → R3, which transforms under such a change of coordinate system as

We may now deﬁne a transformation of the deformation ϕ : Ω ⊆ R3 7→ R3 to new spatial and referential
coordinates via7

Gathering our ﬁndings so far we can state:

The nonlinear hyperelastic formulation is

frame-indiﬀerent and isotropic if and
there exists Ψ : Sym+(3) → R such that W (F ) = Ψ(F T F ) and

z}|{=

(2.12)

In nonlinear elasticity, invariance of the formulation under eq.(2.9) is a consequence of objectivity (left SO(3)-
invariance of the energy). Therefore, the transformation in eq.(2.9) may be used to probe objectivity and
isotropy of the formulation, while it is not equivalent to both. If we assume already the reduced representation
in Ψ, then rotational invariance of the formulation under eq.(2.9) is equivalent to isotropy, see also [34, p. 220] .

The well-known representation theorems imply that any W satisfying the isotropy condition and the classical
format of material frame-indiﬀerence,

W (QF ) = W (F ) = Ψ(C) ∀Q ∈ SO(3) ,
must be expressible in terms of the principal invariants of C = F T F , i.e.,

where

W (F ) = Ψ(C) = bΨ(I1(C), I2(C), I3(C)) ,

I1(C) := tr(C) ,

I2(C) := tr(Cof C)

I3(C) := det C .

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

Incidentally, W (F ) = Ψ(C) = bΨ(I1(C), I2(C), I3(C)) is not only invariant under compatible changes of the

reference conﬁguration with rigid rotations Q (constant rotations), but also under inhomogeneous rotation
ﬁelds Q(x), that is,

7For isotropy considerations it is useful to think of the domain Ω ⊆ R3 to be a ﬁnite-sized ball B ⊆ R3 which is invariant under

W (F Q(x)) = W (F )

∀Q(x) ∈ SO(3) ,

(2.16)

rotations. Then ϕ♯ : B ⊆ R3 7→ R3.

8Antman [2, p. 470] starts directly by considering F ♯ = Q F QT in his discussion of isotropy for frame-indiﬀerent formulations,

however, he remains on the level of stresses.

8

since

Ik((F Q(x))T F Q(x)) = Ik(Q(x)T F T F Q(x)) = Ik(F T F ) ,

k = 1, 2, 3 .

(2.17)

Therefore, the principal invariants Ik are unaﬀected by inhomogeneous rotations. However, we must stress that
isotropy per se is not deﬁned as invariance under right multiplication with Q = Q(x) ∈ SO(3). The diﬀerence
between form-invariance under compatible transformations with rigid rotations Q (isotropy) and right-invariance
under inhomogeneous rotation ﬁelds Q = Q(x) ∈ SO(3) will only become visible in higher gradient elasticity
treated in the next section. In any ﬁrst gradient theory both requirements coincide. Note that likewise, (2.16)
is invariant under left multiplication with inhomogeneous rotation ﬁelds. We deﬁne for further use

left-local SO(3)-invariance

: W (Q(x) F (x)) = W (F (x)) ∀Q(x) ∈ SO(3)
right-local SO(3)-invariance : W (F (x) Q(x)) = W (F (x)) ∀Q(x) ∈ SO(3) .

Similarly, we deﬁne for constant rotations Q ∈ SO(3)

left-global SO(3)-invariance

right-global SO(3)-invariance : W (F (x) Q) = W (F (x)) ∀Q ∈ SO(3)

: W (Q F (x)) = W (F (x)) ∀Q ∈ SO(3) objectivity
isotropy .

(2.18)

(2.19)

With these deﬁnitions we have shown that for W (F ) = bΨ(I1(C), I2(C), I3(C)) both, local and global, left and

right SO(3) invariance are satisﬁed. Left-global SO(3)-invariance is identical to the Cosserat’s invariance under
”action euclidienne” [7].

2.2

Isotropy in second gradient nonlinear elasticity

In this subsection we would like to extend the ”local” picture of the previous subsection to second gradient
materials. For the sake of clarity we leave ﬁrst objectivity aside and discuss only isotropy. Moreover, we make
the following simplifying assumptions.

We consider a homogeneous material given as a ﬁnite-sized ball B ⊂ R3 and we want to formalize the
statement that ﬁrst rotating the ball B and then to apply the loads leaves invariant the response in the sense
that this is indistinguishable from not rotating the ball, see Fig. 1. This is in accordance with the statement
in Truesdell & Noll [53, p. 78]: ”For an isotropic material in an undistorted state, a physical test cannot detect
whether or not the material has been rotated arbitrarily before the test ist made.”

Let the elastic energy of the body B ⊂ R3 depend also on second gradients of the deformation, i.e. we

consider therefore,

Zx ∈ B
W (F (x), GRADx[F (x)]) dx = Zx ∈ B

W (Gradx[ϕ(x)], GRADx[Gradx[ϕ(x)]]) dx .

(2.20)

We ﬁrst transform eq.(2.20) to new coordinates ξ ∈ R3 via introducing an orientation preserving diﬀeomorphism
ζ : B ⊂ R3 7→ R3,

x = ζ(ξ) ,

ξ = ζ −1(x) ,

x = ζ(ζ −1(x)) ,

(2.21)

see also [38, 49]. For further reference, we compute some relations connected to the transformation (2.21).
Taking the ﬁrst and second derivative with respect to x in (2.21)3 and using (2.21)2 we obtain

1 = Gradξ[ζ(ζ −1(x))] Gradx[ζ −1(x)] ⇔ Gradx[ζ −1(x)] = (Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1 ,

(2.22)

Figure 1: Isotropy: We consider a ﬁnite-sized ball B of homogeneous material in an initial undistorted conﬁg-
uration, which may be rotated by a constant rotation Q ∈ SO(3) (left). Isotropy requires that the deformation
response is independent of Q if we apply the same loading to both conﬁgurations: there is no preferred direction
(right).

and

0 = GRADx[Gradξ[ζ(ζ −1(x))] Gradx[ζ −1(x)]]
0 = GRADx[Gradξ[ζ(ζ −1(x))]] Gradx[ζ −1(x)] + Gradξ[ζ(ζ −1(x))] GRADx[Gradx[ζ −1(x)]]

⇔ 0 = GRADξ [Gradξ[ζ(ζ −1(x))]] Gradx[ζ −1(x)] Gradx[ζ −1(x)] + Gradξ [ζ(ζ −1(x))] GRADx[Gradx[ζ −1(x)]]
⇔ Gradξ[ζ(ζ −1(x))] GRADx[Gradx[ζ −1(x)]] = −GRADξ [Gradξ[ζ(ξ)]] Gradx[ζ −1(x)] Gradx[ζ −1(x)] .
(2.23)

With help of eq.(2.22) the latter implies

GRADx[Gradx[ζ −1(x)]] = −(Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1 GRADξ [Gradξ[ζ(ξ)]] (Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1 (Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1 .

(2.24)

Connected to the coordinate transformation (2.21) we consider the deformation expressed in these new coordi-
nates via setting

ϕ♭(ξ) := ϕ(ζ(ξ)) ,

ϕ♭(ζ −1(x)) = ϕ(x) .

(2.25)

The standard chain rule induces for the ﬁrst and second derivative of ϕ(x) with respect to x the following
relations

Gradx[ϕ(x)] = Gradξ[ϕ♭(ζ −1(x))] Gradx[ζ −1(x)] ,

(2.26)

10

and

GRADx[Gradx[ϕ(x)]]

= GRADξ[Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)]] Gradx[ζ −1(x)] Gradx[ζ −1(x)] + Gradξ [ϕ♭(ξ)] GRADx[Gradx[ζ −1(x)]] .

(2.27)

The elastic energy (2.20), expressed in new coordinates via the transformation of integrals formula reads then,
inserting (2.26) and (2.27)

ξ ∈ ζ −1(B)

Z

W(cid:18)Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)] Gradx[ζ −1(x)], GRADξ[Gradξ [ϕ♭(ξ)]] Gradx[ζ −1(x)] Gradx[ζ −1(x)]

W(cid:18)Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)] (Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1, GRADξ [Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)]] (Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1 (Gradξ [ζ(ξ)])−1

We rewrite (2.28) as follows, using again Gradx[ζ −1(x)] = (Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1 from (2.22)

ξ ∈ ζ −1(B)

(2.28)

+ Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)] GRADx[Gradx[ζ −1(x)]](cid:19) det(Gradξ[ζ(ξ)]) dξ . (2.29)

Further, we use relation (2.24) to substitute GRADx[Gradx[ζ −1(x)]] yielding

Z

W(cid:18)Gradξ [ϕ♭(ξ)] (Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1, GRADξ[Gradξ [ϕ♭(ξ)]] (Gradξ [ζ(ξ)])−1 (Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1

− Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)] (Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1 GRADξ [Gradξ[ζ(ξ)]] (Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1 (Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1(cid:19) det(Gradξ [ζ(ξ)]) dξ .

(2.30)

We say that the elastic energy (2.20) is form-invariant with respect to the (referential) coordinate transfor-
mation ζ if and only if

Z

ξ ∈ ζ −1(B)

(2.31)

and we call then ζ a material symmetry transformation, cf. [10, eq.(11)], [13, 12] and [6, p. 75, Def. 2.4].
It is simple to see that for equality (2.31) to be satisﬁed at all, we must have

It can be shown as well that we may restrict attention to the situation

det(Gradξ[ζ(ξ)]) = 1 .

Gradξ[ζ(ξ)] ∈ G ⊆ SO(3)

∀ ξ ∈ ζ −1(B) ,

(2.32)

(2.33)

which is consistent with the local statement in the previous subsection 5.1. Here, G ⊆ SO(3) is a subgroup of the
proper rotation group SO(3).9 The group G can be discrete10 (for e.g. orthotropy) or continuous (continuous

9If G ⊆ O(3) and −1 ∈ G then the material is called centro-symmetric. We do not discuss this possibility.
10The ﬁrst classiﬁcation of discrete subgroups G ⊆ SO(3) has been given in Hessel [25].

11

for transverse isotropy and isotropy). We may therefore specify (2.31) to the case of G ⊆ SO(3) and writing

(Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1 = Q(ξ) ,

(2.34)

we obtain as ﬁrst concise form-invariance statement for material symmetry

Z

W(cid:18)Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)], GRADξ[Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)]](cid:19) dξ ∀Q(ξ) ∈ G . (2.35)

=

ξ ∈ ζ −1(B)

The format (2.35) can be found e.g. in [11, 37]. The homogeneous material is usually said to be isotropic follow-
ing the local reasoning,11 whenever G ≡ SO(3) and (2.35) holds for all non-constant rotation ﬁelds Q(ξ) ∈ SO(3).
In the following, consistent with previous deﬁnitions, we will call (2.35) right-local SO(3)-invariance.

Let us proceed by showing that right-local SO(3)-invariance in (2.35) is, however, misconceived as a general
condition for isotropy. The misconception in (2.35) consists in suggesting a generality of transformation be-
haviour followed for the rotation ﬁeld Q(ξ) that is, in reality, not present. To see this we refer to Figure 1.
Requiring in (2.34) that

(Gradξ[ζ(ξ)])−1 = QT (ξ) ∈ SO(3) ⇔ Gradξ[ζ(ξ)] = Q(ξ) ∈ SO(3)

(2.36)

means, by a classical geometric rigidity result (see e.g. [44]) that indeed

Gradξ [ζ(ξ)] = Q(ξ) ∈ SO(3) ⇒ Q(ξ) = Q = const. and ζ(ξ) = Q ξ + b
compatibility of rotations .
and therefore GRADξ[Gradξ[ζ(ξ)]] = 0

(2.37)

Thus, the correct statement for isotropy, in our view is,12 noting that for a global rotation of the coordinates
we have ζ −1(B) = B

11In Bertram [6, p. 75] we read ”This group is used to deﬁne isotropy or anisotropy. If the symmetry group is a subgroup of
[SO(3)] in the ﬁrst entry and the zero in the second, (Q, 0), these transformations can be interpreted as rigid rotations, and we call
the respective reference placement an undistorted state. If a material allows for such undistorted states, it is a solid. If it contains
all orthogonal dyadics in the ﬁrst entry, then the material is called isotropic”. This statement leaves open that for isotropy, we
may choose inhomogeneous rotations Q(x). In our setting we understand by isotropy using necessarily rigid rotations and therefore
only (Q, 0).

12Consistent with condition (2.38) Huang [26, eq.(3),(4)] arrives at the isotropy requirement

where W is the free-energy of the nonlinear couple stress model of Toupin [51]. Additionally, in [27] also the anisotropic case is
given, c.f. [14, 15, 16].

12

We will refer to this condition as right-global SO(3)-invariance, which, for us, is isotropy.13 We appreciate
that the right-local SO(3)-invariance condition (2.35) is much to restrictive in that arbitrary, inhomogeneous
rotation ﬁelds are allowed instead of only constant rotations Q. The reader should carefully note that we started
by using a coordinate transformation x = ζ(ξ) and therefore we require in the end that ζ(ξ) = Q ξ + ¯b, in line
with our understanding to really rotate the ﬁnite sized ball. There is no other coordinate transformation ζ such
that Gradξ[ζ(ξ)] = Q(ξ) ∈ SO(3) everywhere, provided a minimum level of smoothness is assumed. We note
that (2.35) ⇒ (2.38).14

right-local SO(3)-invariance ⇒ right-global SO(3)-invariance ⇔ isotropy

(2.35)

(2.38)

The condition (2.38) is consistent with [37, eq.16] in that the term with additional ﬁrst ξ-derivatives on Q in
(2.35) is absent. We remark again, that in the local theory the condition

Zξ ∈ B
W(cid:16)Gradξ [ϕ♭(ξ)] Q

T(cid:17) dξ = Zξ ∈ B

W(cid:16)Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)](cid:17) dξ ∀Q ∈ SO(3)

(2.39)

cannot distinguish between constant or non-constant rotations, as seen in (2.17). This means for the local
theory that (2.39) implies and is therefore equivalent to

Zξ ∈ B
W(cid:16)Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)] Q

T

(ξ)(cid:17) dξ = Zξ ∈ B

W(cid:16)Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)](cid:17) dξ .

(2.40)

The latter might explain why one may be inclined to allow non-constant rotation ﬁelds in (2.35), which is
forbidden for higher gradient materials, as we saw.

2.3 Objectivity and isotropy in nonlinear elasticity - the non-local case

In higher gradient elasticity, however, not every (left-global SO(3)-invariant) objective energy is also left-local
SO(3)-invariant.15 This can be seen by looking at

W (F, GRAD[F ]) = Ψ(C) +

k F T ∂F

∂xi k2 .

13Toupin [51, p. 108] notes: ”The material symmetry group of a homogeneous, isotropic material is the set of all distance-

preserving transformations [Q x + b].”

14More can be said in case of splitted energies W (F, GRAD[F ]) = Wlocal(F )+Wcurv(GRAD[F ]). There, Wlocal must be isotropic

and the condition on Wcurv can be localized, yielding in the end

Z

Wcurv(GRADξ [Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)]] QT(ξ) QT(ξ)) dξ = Z

Wcurv(GRADξ [Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)]]) dx ∀Q(ξ) ∈ SO(3) .

Thus, (2.38) can be expressed with inhomogeneous rotation ﬁelds since the space derivatives do not act on the rotations in this
representation.

Note that (2.41) is right-global SO(3)-invariant, but not right-local SO(3)-invariant, which can be seen similarly
to the above discussion.

Next, we assume for simplicity a free energy density of the form W = W (F )+ Wcurv(GRADx[F ]). Moreover,
we already consider a further reduced objective format W = Ψ(F T F ) + Ψcurv(GRADx[F T F ]), which is left-
local and left-global SO(3) invariant as seen above. Now, for investigation of isotropy, it suﬃces to concentrate
on the induced conditions on Ψcurv(GRADx[F T F ]). We repeat the (referential) coordinate transformation and
we already observed in (2.47) that we can always write

Moreover, from the results of the previous section right-global SO(3)-invariance under constant rotations
Q ∈ SO(3) is equivalent to

Ψcurv(GRADx[F T F ]) = bΨcurv(F T GRADx[F ]) .

As an example, let us quickly check that the objective (left-global SO(3)-invariant) curvature expression

k GRADx[Gradx[ϕ(x)]]k2 ,

is isotropic in the sense of right-global SO(3)-invariance (2.38). Indeed, we have to check only that

Note, however, that (2.51) is a prototype expression which does not satisfy the right-local SO(3)-invariance
condition (2.35). This is the case, since for inhomogeneous rotation ﬁelds Q(ξ) ∈ SO(3) we have

k GRADξ [Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)]]Q(ξ) Q(ξ) − Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)] Q(ξ) GRADξ[Q(ξ)] Q(ξ) Q(ξ)k2

6= k GRADξ[Gradξ[ϕ♭(ξ)]]k2 .

(2.54)

It is instructive to see that the right-local SO(3)-invariance (2.35) can be satisﬁed nevertheless within a second
gradient model by taking

W (F, GRADx[F ]) = Ψ(C, GRADx[C]) = bΨ(I1(C), I2(C), I3(C)) +

(2.55)

with bΨ : R3 7→ R arbitrary. In this formulation, objectivity is clear, as the functional dependence is expressed

only in C = F T F and isotropy will be secured by working only with the principal invariants Ik and their
derivatives. In order to see that right-local SO(3)-invariance (2.35) is satisﬁed we look exemplarily at

2.3.1 Right-local SO(3)-invariant energies

R3 is already right-local SO(3)-invariant.

In the lack of having an encompassing representation theorem for right-local SO(3)-invariant functions let us
describe a large class of such expressions. For this we assume that

(2.60)

Ψ(C, GRADx[C]) = bΨ(I1(C), I2(C), I3(C)) +bΨcurv(Gradx[bI(C)]) ,

where we deﬁned the vector of principal invariants bI : Sym+(3) 7→ R3, bI(C) := ((I1(C), I2(C), I3(C)) and we

specify, furthermore, that16

bΨcurv(Gradx[bI(C)]) = bbΨcurv((Gradx[bI(C)])T Gradx[bI(C)]) .
Then right-local SO(3)-invariance is entirely dependent upon properties of bbΨ, namely
bbΨcurv(Q(ξ) Gradx[bI(C)]T Gradx[bI(C)] Q(ξ)T ) = bbΨcurv(Gradx[bI(C)]T Gradx[bI(C)]) ∀ Q(ξ) ∈ SO(3) .
Thus, similar to the local case, bbΨcurv can be further reduced to a symmetric function of the singular values
of Gradx[bI(C)].
In fact, another representation, also reminiscent of the local theory suggests itself. Any bΨcurv(Gradx[bI(C)])

satisﬁes right-local SO(3)-invariance if an only if

(2.61)

(2.62)

The latter may be used to obtain the reduced format

where

bΨcurv(Gradx[bI(C)] Q(ξ)) = bΨcurv(Gradx[bI(C)]) .
bΨcurv(Gradx[bI(C)]) = eΨcurv(Gradx[bI(C)] (Gradx[bI(C)])T

16Note that the reduction in eq.(2.61) is not warranted by objectivity assumptions but just a simpliﬁcation.
17In the local theory it would follow that B 7→ σ(B) is an isotropic tensor function and the strain energy is an isotropic function
of B. However, this further reduction possibility is not viable here since we would need an additional objectivity requirement. This
is absent in (2.64).

2.4 A problem with compatibility and left-local SO(3)-invariance

∂xi k2 is frame-
indiﬀerent (left-global SO(3)-invariant) but not left-local SO(3)-invariant. However, using an involved compat-
ibility argument [54, 30] one can show that

Let us approach the problem with an easy example. We have seen in Sect.2.3 thatP3
∂xi k2 = bΨ(√F T F , GRAD[√F T F ]) = bbΨ(C, GRAD[C]) ,

and the right-hand side is clearly left-local SO(3)-invariant. In fact, it can be shown that every objective second
gradient energy can be represented as18

(2.66)

W (F, GRAD[F ]) = Ψ(F T F, F T GRAD[F ]) = bbΨ(C, GRAD[C]) ,

see Toupin [51, eq.(10.24)+(10.26)] and [50, eq.(5.12)]. This may lead one to assume that working solely with

bbΨ(C, GRAD[C]) exhausts all possible fomulations for frame-indiﬀerent second gradient models. Surprisingly,

the situation is more complicated. Returning to (2.66) we observe

(2.69)

The situation is completely analogous to the linearized case in which e.g.

1
4 k Grad[curl(u)]k2 = k Grad[axl( skew Grad[u])]k2 = k Curl sym Grad[u]k2 ,

see eq.(1.22) and (1.23), and both expressions are (left) global so(3)-invariant, i.e.
invariant w.r.t. the trans-
formation Grad[u] 7→ A + Grad[u] , A ∈ so(3). Equality in (2.69) holds only for gradients Grad[u] and uses
compatibility. As equal energy expressions, both terms in (2.69) give rise to equivalent Euler-Lagrange equa-
tions, while the formulation based on Grad[axl( skew Grad[u])] delivers non-symmetric force-stresses and
the formulation based on Curl sym Grad[u] gives symmetric force stresses, see (6.19). The diﬀerence resides
in an extra stress contribution which has zero divergence, see [19]. Therefore, both formulas, although based
on the same energy, may yield essentially diﬀerent boundary value problems. The diﬀerence occurs for certain
boundary conditions and load cases [33]. Thus it makes a fundamental diﬀerence starting with the left or right
term in (2.69), similarly with (2.66). In summary,

the complete model formulation based on left-global SO(3)-invariance is not necessarily cap-
tured by starting with a left-local SO(3)-invariant expression. Hence, not all frame-indiﬀerent
variational formulations can be obtained by assuming W (F, GRAD[F ]) = Ψ(C, GRAD[C]) and
working with the latter expression Ψ(C, GRAD[C]).19

Moreover, while representation theorems for isotropic energies in the reduced format Ψ(C, GRAD[C]) are well-
known, cf. Sect.A.5 and [9], the more complete format is given by Ψ(F T F, F T GRAD[F ]) and representation
theorems for isotropic models in this extended setting are not standard.

18A further equivalent possibility is to use the ”connection” F −1Grad[F ] = C−1(F T Grad[F ]). This is done in Bertram [6].

3 A short look at objectivity and isotropy in linearized elasticity

The form of the stress-strain law for linear elastic solids [32] reads

σ = C ε .

(3.1)

In order to discuss isotropy, the classical procedure is to consider σ and ε as linear mappings and refer these linear
mappings to new axes of coordinates. We note that any linear mapping has a meaning independent of the used
coordinate system. Then isotropy means that the formula connecting stress components with strain components
is independent of the direction of the new axis. In this case the quadratic energy function Ψlin(ε) = 1
2hC ε, εi is
invariant for all transformations from one set of orthogonal axes to another:

σ♯ := Q σ QT ,

ε♯ := Q ε QT ,

Ψlin(ε♯)

Hence, isotropy is equivalent to

invariance

z}|{= Ψlin(ε) .

Ψlin(ε♯) = Ψlin(Q ε QT )

In terms of the elasticity tensor, eq.(3.3) implies

isotropy

z}|{= Ψlin(ε) ∀ Q ∈ SO(3) .

C =

2

D2

εΨlin(ε) =

1
2

D2

ε♯Ψlin(ε♯) = C♯ .

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

In an isotropic material, when we do not want to directly work with the elastic energy, the principal axes of
stress σ and strain ε must coincide:

C ε♯ = C (Q ε QT ) = Q (C ε) QT ,

σ♯ = C♯ ε♯ = Q σ QT .

(3.5)

Up to this point, the isotropy condition in eq.(3.2) is not directly related to our ♯-transformation since (σ, ε)
are taken merely as linear mappings. Next we show that by properly introducing the ♯-transformation, isotropy
in linear elasticity can be completely characterized. Due to linear isotropic elasticity the simultaneous transfor-
mation of spatial and referential coordinates20 yields the Cauchy stress σ = 2 µ sym Grad[u] + λ tr(Grad[u]) 1
in the transformed representation

σ♯(ξ) = σ♯(Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]) = 2 µ sym(Q Gradξ [u♯(ξ)]QT ) + λ tr(Q Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]QT )1
= 2 µ sym(Q Gradx[u(x)]QT ) + λ tr(Q Gradx[u(x)]QT )1
= Q {2 µ sym Gradx[u(x)] + λ tr(Gradx[u(x)])1}QT
= Q σ(Gradx[u(x)])QT = Q σ(x) QT .

(3.6)

But in any (rotated) coordinate system the elasticity tensor has the same format from assuming isotropy21

where

σ(x) = C ε(x)

and

σ♯(ξ) = C♯ ε♯(ξ) ,

σ♯(ξ) = Q σ(x) QT

and

ε♯(ξ) = Q ε(x) QT .

Thus, the requirement for isotropy is simply

C = C♯ ,

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

20Note that rotating the spatial and referential frame by the same rotation for a linear elastic framework makes sense since

linear elasticity does not distinguish between these two frames.

21Eringen [17, p. 151]: ”An elastic material is said to be isotropic in its natural state if the constitutive equation [σ♯ = Q σ QT ]

is form-invariant with respect to a full orthogonal group of transformations of the natural state...”

18

in terms of our ♯-transformation. This yields

Q σ(x) QT = C♯(Q ε(x) QT )

Q (C ε(x)) QT = C♯(Q ε(x) QT ) ∀ Q ∈ SO(3)

ε ∈ Sym(3) .

(3.10)

Eq.(3.9) and (3.10) imply Q (C ε) QT = C (Q ε QT ). Since this is true for any ε ∈ Sym(3) we have in components:
(3.11)

Cijkl = Qia Qjb Qkc Qld Cabcd ,

the general solution, for symmetric tensors ε is the well-known relation

C ε = 2 µ ε + λ tr(ε) 1 ,

where µ is the shear modulus and λ is the second Lam´e parameter.
In linear elasticity the quadratic energy Wlin is deﬁned as a function of the displacement gradient

Linearized frame-indiﬀerence requires that

Gradx[u(x)] = Grad[ϕ(x)] − 1

for ϕ(x) = x + u(x) .

This implies the reduced representation

Wlin(Grad[u] + W ) = Wlin(Grad[u])

∀ W ∈ so(3) .

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

Wlin(Grad[u]) = Ψlin(sym Grad[u]) = Ψlin(ε) ,

ε := sym Grad[u] .

(3.15)

Describing the deformation ϕ(x) = x + u(x) by the displacement ﬁeld u(x) one also gets

ϕ♯(ξ) = Q ϕ(QT ξ) = Q [QT ξ + u(QT ξ)] = ξ + Q u(QT ξ) = ξ + u♯(ξ) ,

(3.16)

which shows that the tranformation in eq.(2.9) is compatible with respect to displacements and deformations.
Considering

(Gradξ [ϕ♯])T Gradξ[ϕ♯] = Q (Gradx[ϕ])T QT Q Gradx[ϕ] QT = Q (Gradx[ϕ])T Gradx[ϕ] QT

= Q [1 + 2 sym Gradx[u(x)] + h.o.t.] QT = 1 + 2 Q sym Gradx[u(x)] QT + h.o.t.
= 1 + 2 sym Q Gradx[u(x)] QT + h.o.t. = 1 + 2 sym Gradξ[u♯(ξ)] + h.o.t. ,

(3.17)

we may use transformation (2.9) for a geometrically linear displacement formulation and probe objectivity and
isotropy in problems with linearized kinematics, which is investigated in the next section22. As a preliminary,
for the isotropic Cauchy stress tensor σ in linear elasticity

σ = 2 µ sym Gradx[u(x)] + λ tr(sym Gradx[u(x)]) 1 ,

σ♯(ξ) = Q σ(x) QT = 2 µ sym Gradξ [u♯(ξ)] + λ tr(sym Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]) 1 ,

(3.18)

(3.19)

we obtain

as expected.

22Only transforming the referential coordinate system by deﬁning ϕ♭(ξ) := ϕ(QT ξ) is not compatible with the linear displacement

formulation, since, Gradξ [ϕ♭(ξ)] = (Gradx[ϕ(x)]) Q and

(Gradξ [ϕ♭])T Gradξ[ϕ♭] = Q (Gradx[ϕ])T Gradx[ϕ] QT = Q [1 + 2 sym(Gradx[u(x)] + h.o.t.) QT

= 1 + 2 Q sym(Gradx[u(x)]) QT + h.o.t. = 1 + 2 sym(Q Gradx[u(x)] QT ) + h.o.t.
6= 1 + 2 sym Gradξ [u♭(ξ)] + h.o.t. = 1 + 2 sym(Gradx[u(x)] Q) + h.o.t.

Note that ϕ♭(ξ) = ϕ♭(QT ξ) is the correct transformation in nonlinear elasticity when we only want to discuss isotropy there as
seen in Section 2.3.

19

It is illuminating to see that, although in a linearized context, we may still use the full ♯-transformation23

u♯(ξ) := Q u(QT ξ) ,

Gradξ[u♯(ξ)] = Q Gradx[u(x)] QT

(3.20)

for the displacement u, since it is fully consistent with the corresponding transformation for the deformation:

ϕ♯(ξ) = Q ϕ(QT ξ) ,

Gradξ [ϕ♯(ξ)] = Q Gradx[ϕ(x)] QT

and

Gradξ[ϕ♯(ξ)] − 1 = Q Gradx[ϕ(x)] QT − 1 = Q (Gradx[ϕ(x)] − 1) QT = Q Gradx[u(x)] QT

= Gradξ[u♯(ξ)] .

With the help of the ♯-transformation we may alternatively characterize frame-indiﬀerence and isotropy.

The linear hyperelastic formulation is (linearized) frame-indiﬀerent and isotropic if and only
if there exists Ψlin : Sym(3) → R such that

linearized

Ψlin(sym Grad[u]) ,

and

frame−indifferent

z}|{=

Wlin(Gradξ [u♯(ξ)])

z}|{=

Wlin(Gradx[u(x)])

(cid:2)i.e. Ψlin(Q ε QT ) = Ψlin(ε)∀ Q ∈ SO(3) .(cid:3)

(3.21)

(3.22)

(3.23)

The latter result is in complete correspondence to the ﬁnite strain setting in eq.(2.12). In conclusion: if we work
already within the reduced format of

Wlin(Grad[u]) = Ψlin(sym Grad[u]) → (linearized frame − indiﬀerence) ,

(3.24)

then, isotropy is nothing else but form-invariance of the energy Wlin under the ♯-transformation. It is this simple
observation that will be subsequently made operable for linear higher-gradient elasticity.

The reader should carefully note that linearized elasticity, as we treat it here, is not frame-indiﬀerent in the
precise sense that it is not left-invariant under rotations in SO(3). By this we mean that for ϕ(x) = x + u(x)
one can write, formally, the linear elastic energy (wether isotropic or anisotropic) as

Wlin(Grad[ϕ]) = Wlin (sym(Grad[ϕ] − 1)) ,
and in this representation, Wlin is not left-invariant under the SO(3)-action.24

4 Simultaneous rotation of spatial and referential coordinates

Let us consider the Lagrangian description of the displacement ﬁeld

with components ui in the basis ei at the referential position x.

u(x) = ui(x) ei ,

We investigate transformation rules for the simultaneous transformation of
spatial and referential coordinates by the same rigid rotation Q ∈ SO(3)

u♯(Q x) := Q u(x) ,

ξ := Q x ,

x := QT ξ

u♯(ξ) = Q u(QT ξ) ⇔ u(x) = QT u♯(ξ) .

(3.25)

(4.1)

(4.2)

23c.f. [6, eq. 3.18].
24 The claim in [48] on frame-invariance of linear elasticity seems to be due to a non-standard re-interpretation of objectivity,

see also [55] and [18].

20

Then the Jacobian matrix is given by the transposition of the rotation tensor:

∂(x(ξ))i

∂ξj

=

∂(QT
ia ξa)
∂ξj

= QT

ia δaj = QT

ij .

(4.3)

The simultaneous rotation of spatial and referential coordinates leaves the energy content stored due to defor-
mation of a ﬁnite sized ball invariant. It depends only on the shape of the ellipse, not on its (irrelevant) inner
structure nor its rotation in space, see Fig. 2.

Figure 2: Left: Consider a ﬁnite-sized ball B in an undistorted initial conﬁguration, which may be rotated by
a constant rotation Q ∈ SO(3). Right: Isotropy requires that deformation is rotated by Q if we apply loading
rotated by the same Q: the energy content again depends only on the shape of the ellipse.

4.1 Standard transformation rules

In this section the transformation (4.2) of standard vectorial and tensorial functions is under investigation. As
already seen in eq.(2.11) the gradient of the displacement ﬁeld u transforms via

Gradξ[u♯(ξ)] = Gradξ [Q u(QT ξ)] =

∂ [Q u(QT ξ)]

∂ ξ

= Q

∂ u(x)

∂ x

∂ x
∂ ξ

= Q Gradx[u(x)] QT .

(4.4)

The divergence of the displacement ﬁeld yields

divξ[u♯(ξ)] = tr(Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]) = tr(Gradξ[Q u(QT ξ)]) = tr(Q Gradx[u(x)] QT )

= hQ Gradx[u(x)] QT , 1i = hGradx[u(x)], QT Qi = hGradx[u(x)], 1i = tr(Gradx[u(x)])
= divx[u(x)] ,

(4.6)

The curl of the displacement gradient is given by deﬁnition (1.16) for a second order tensor X ∈ R3×3. From
eq.(1.19) it follows

Curlx{Gradx[u(x)]} = Curlξ{Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]} = 0 .

(4.7)

Of course, eq.(4.7) is not a transformation rule since the Curl of the gradient of the displacement ﬁeld is generally
zero. However, the transformation rule for an arbitrary argument which is not the gradient of a vector ﬁeld will
be discussed in section 4.2. Before, let us see that the transformation (4.2) is compatible with the application
of a sym or skew operator to the gradient of the displacement:

sym{Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]} = sym{Gradξ[Q u(QT ξ)]} = sym{Q Gradx[u(x)] QT}

=

1
2{Q Gradx[u(x)] QT + Q Gradx[u(x)]T QT} = Q sym{Gradx[u(x)]} QT ,

skew{Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]} = skew{Gradξ[Q u(QT ξ)]} = skew{Q Gradx[u(x)] QT}

=

1
2{Q Gradx[u(x)] QT − Q Gradx[u(x)]T QT} = Q skew{Gradx[u(x)]} QT .

From eq.(4.5) it follows that the trace of Grad[u] is invariant under the ♯-transformation, yielding

tr{sym(Gradξ[u♯(ξ)])} = tr{Gradξ [u♯(ξ)]} = tr{Gradx[u(x)]} ,
tr{ skew (Gradξ[u♯(ξ)])} = tr{ skew (Gradx[u(x)])} = 0 .

Thus, the deviator of the symmetric gradient of u transforms accordingly as

dev sym(Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]) = Q sym{Gradx[u(x)]} QT −
1
3

= Q {sym(Gradx[u(x)]) −
= Q {dev sym(Gradx[u(x)])} QT .

1
tr{Gradx[u(x)]} 1
3
tr{Gradx[u(x)]}1} QT

The divergence of the symmetric and skew-symmetric part of Grad[u] then transforms according to

Divξ{sym(Gradξ[u♯(ξ)])} = Divξ{sym(Gradξ[Q u(QT ξ)])} = Divξ{sym(Q Gradx[u(x)] QT )}

= Divξ{Q sym Gradx[u(x)] QT} = Q Divx{sym Gradx[u(x)]} ,

Divξ{ skew (Gradξ[u♯(ξ)])} = Divξ{ skew (Gradξ [Q u(QT ξ)])} = Divξ{ skew (Q Gradx[u(x)] QT )}

= Divξ{Q skew Gradx[u(x)] QT )} = Q Divx{ skew Gradx[u(x)]} .

components of the tensor A in the basis ek, reading

a = axl A = −

Aij ǫijk ek .

(4.15)

Two transformation rules can be found in eq.(4.16): the transformation for the axial-operator and how the
simultaneous transformation of spatial and referential coordinates transform a tensor, reading

A♯ = Q A QT .

(4.17)

Additionally, the transformation of anti : R3 → so(3) is given by eq.(4.16), reading

anti[a♯] = anti[Q a] = anti axl[A♯] = anti axl[Q A QT ] = Q A QT

⇔

anti[a♯] = Q anti[a]QT .

(4.18)

With help of eq.(4.9) and (4.16) we obtain for the curl of the displacement ﬁeld u:

curlξ[u♯(ξ)] = 2 axl skew [Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]] = 2 axl skew [Q Gradx[u(x)] QT ] = 2 axl[Q skew Gradx[u(x)] QT ]

= Q [2 axl skew Gradx[u(x)]] = Q curlx[u(x)] .

The gradient of the curl of the displacement ﬁeld transforms via

4.2 Advanced transformation rules

For the transformations in this section we often use the Cauchy stress tensor σ as the argument, which is a
second order tensor. The divergence lowers a tensor of second order, transforming according to

Next, let us discuss the transformation of the Curl operator for arbitrary second order tensors in R3×3. Therefore,
we consider a generally non-symmetric ﬁeld P : R3 7→ R3×3. The transformation to rotated coordinates is given,
similarly to the gradient Grad[u], see eq.(4.4), by P ♯(ξ) := Q P (QT ξ) QT . Then

Curlξ[P ♯(ξ)] = Curlξ [Q P (QT ξ) QT ] = Q Curlx[P (x)] QT .

(4.28)

This last formula can be seen in several ways. First, with the help of eq.(1.32) we obtain

where LinP (QT ξ) is a linear operator, we obtain formally

+Q Curlξ[P (QT ξ)] ,

Curlξ[Q P (QT ξ) QT ] = Q Curlξ[P (x) QT ] = Q Curlx[P (x)] QT .

Obviously, repeating Curl operators yield the same structure of transformation as in eq.(4.28), e.g.

Note that the Curl of a second order tensor ﬁeld has generally no divergence

(4.34)

which is independent of Q, reading Divξ (Curlξ[σ♯(ξ)]) = Divx(Curlx[σ(x)]) = 0.
Let us reformulate the result in eq.(4.25) by using Grad[u] instead of σ as second order argument:

m♯(ξ) ∼= GRADξ[Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]] = GRADξ[Q Gradx[u(x)] QT ]

Since Q is a constant rotation tensor it is possible to reformulate the result of eq.(4.36) into

4.3 Form-invariance of the linear momentum balance equation

In this subsection we consider the question of form-invariance of the balance equations. To start these consider-
ations, we consider the Laplace equation. Note that the Laplacian △ of a scalar ﬁeld h(x) = h(QT ξ) = h♯(ξ) is
form-invariant concerning our simultaneous transformation of spatial and referential coordinates by the same
rigid rotation:

△ξ h♯(ξ) := divξ gradξ[h♯(ξ)] = divξ gradξ [h(QT ξ)] = divξ(cid:20) ∂ h(QT ξ)

∂ξ

(cid:21) = divξ(cid:20) ∂ h(x)

∂ (Q gradx[h(x)])

∂ ξ

Therefore, the Laplace-equation is form-invariant with respect to the ♯-transformation for scalars25, as is well-
known.

25The Dirichlet-integral for scalar-valued functions is easily seen to be form-invariant under coordinate rotations:

h : R3 → R .

Consider h♭(ξ) := h(QT ξ). Then gradξ [h♭(ξ)] is a row-vector and it holds

Moreover,

The classical balance of linear momentum in linear elasticity includes the divergence of the Cauchy stress σ and
the net force f which both transform via

Divξ[σ♯(ξ)] + f ♯(ξ) = 0 ,
⇔ Divξ[Q σ(QT ξ) QT ] + Q f (QT ξ) = 0
Divξ[Q σ(x) QT ] + Q f (x) = 0
⇔
Q Divx[σ(x)] + Q f (x) = 0
⇔
⇔
Q {Divx[σ(x)] + f (x)} = 0
Divx[σ(x)] + f (x) = 0 .
⇔

f ♯( ξ) := Q f (QT ξ)

(4.40)

Therefore, the linear elasticity equations are form-invariant with respect to the ♯-transformation.

concerning its symmetric part

The transformation with Q from the left also holds for the divergence of second order couple stress m ∼ek♯(ξ)

and also concerning its skew-symmetric part

Divξ (sym[ek♯(ξ)]) = Divξ[Q sym[ek(x)] QT ] = Q Divx(sym[ek(x)]) ,
Divξ( skew [ek♯(ξ)]) = Divξ [Q skew [ek(x)] QT ] = Q Divx( skew [ek(x)]) .

that its transformation reads for the symmetric part

In the isotropic indeterminate couple stress theory the nonlocal force stress is given byeτ = − 1
adds to the local force stress yielding the total stress eσ = σ +eτ . Since m ∼ek we ﬁnd with help of eq.(4.18)
anti{Divξ(sym[ek♯(ξ)])} = anti{Q Divx (sym[ek(x)])} = Q anti{Divx(sym[ek(x)])} QT ,
anti{Divξ( skew [ek♯(ξ)])} = anti{Q Divx ( skew [ek(x)])} = Q anti{Divx( skew [ek(x)])} QT .

Thus, the divergence of the nonlocal stress contribution transforms like the local stress via

and similarly for its skew-symmetric part

2 anti Div m and

(4.44)

(4.43)

(4.41)

(4.42)

(4.45)

(4.46)

Divξ [anti{Divξ (sym[ek♯(ξ)])}] = Divξ [Q anti{Divx (sym[ek(x)])} QT ]
= Q Divx[anti{Divx(sym[ek(x)])}] ,

and

Divξ [anti{Divξ ( skew [ek♯(ξ)])}] = Divξ [Q anti{Divx ( skew [ek(x)])} QT ]
= Q Divx[anti{Divx( skew [ek(x)])}] .

This can also be seen if we directly write the (extended) balance of linear momentum of the indeterminate
couple stress model via

Divξ{σ♯(ξ) − 1

Divξ{Q σ(x) QT − 1

⇔ Divξ{Q σ(QT ξ) QT − 1
⇔
⇔
⇔
⇔

Divξ{Q σ(x) QT − 1

2 anti Divξ[m♯(ξ)]} + f ♯(ξ) = 0
2 anti Divξ[Q m(x) QT ]} + Q f (QT ξ) = 0
2 anti(Q Divx[m(x)])} + Q f (x) = 0
2 Q (anti Divx[m(x)]) QT} + Q f (x) = 0
2 anti Divx[m(x)]} + Q f (x) = 0
2 anti Divx[m(x)]} + f (x) = 0 .

Divx{σ(x) − 1

Q Divx{σ(x) − 1

(4.47)

27

Therefore, the balance equations of the indeterminate couple stress model are form-invariant with respect to
the ♯-transformation.

Alternatively, the hyperstress tensor m of third order may appear in higher gradient theories via

m♯(ξ) = L.GRADξ [Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]] = L.D2
the identity L.n = n for any n ∈ R3×3×3 for simplicity. Thus, we obtain from eq.(4.38) the transformation

ξ u♯(ξ), where L is a 6th order tensor. We only consider L to map like

DivξDIVξ[m♯(ξ)] = DivξDIVξ{GRADξ[Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]]} = Q Divx(Gradx[Divx{Gradx[u(x)]}])

= Q DivxDIVx {GRADx[Gradx[u(x)]]}

|

= Q Divx{DIVx[m(x)]} .

= m(x)

{z

}

Hence the balance of linear momentum in a full higher gradient theory transforms according to

Divξ[σ♯(ξ) + DIVξ[m♯(ξ)]] + f ♯(ξ) = 0
Divξ [σ♯(ξ)] + f ♯(ξ) + Divξ DIVξ [m♯(ξ)] = 0
Divξ[Q σ(QT ξ) QT ] + Q f (QT ξ) + Divξ DIVξ [m♯(ξ)] = 0
Q Divx[σ(x)] + Q f (x) + Q {Divx DIVx[m(x)]} = 0
Divx[σ(x) + DIVxm(x)] + f (x) = 0 .

⇔
⇔
⇔
⇔

(4.48)

(4.49)

Therefore, the balance equations of the higher gradient model are form-invariant with respect to the ♯-transformation.

Finally, we show that the form invariance condition for the system of eq.(6.19) in a variant of the indeter-

minate couple stress theory [19] always holds true:26

Divξ[σ♯(ξ) + sym Curlξ(m♯(ξ))] + f ♯(ξ) = 0
⇔ Divξ[Q σ(QT ξ) QT + sym Curlξ(Q m(QT ξ) QT )] + Q f (QT ξ) = 0
Divξ [Q σ(x) QT + sym{Q Curlx(m(x)) QT}] + Q f (x) = 0
⇔
Divξ[Q σ(x) QT + Q sym Curlx(m(x)) QT ] + Q f (x) = 0
⇔
Divξ[Q {σ(x) + sym Curlx(m(x))} QT ] + Q f (x) = 0
⇔
Q Divx[σ(x) + sym Curlx(m(x))] + Q f (x) = 0
⇔
⇔
Q {Divx[σ(x) + sym Curlx(m(x))] + f (x)} = 0
Divx[σ(x) + sym Curlx(m(x))] + f (x) = 0 .
⇔

(4.50)

5 Objectivity and isotropy in linear higher gradient elasticity

Now we turn back to the invariance considerations in Sections 2 and 3. Motivated by the insights obtained
there, we require form-invariance of the energy expression also in higher gradient or couple-stress models.
As a primer, consider the higher order curvature expression

Wcurv = µ L2

c k sym Curl (sym Grad[u])k2 .

(5.1)

26In the physics oriented literature, form-invariance of objects under certain coordinate transformations is called covariance.
Obviously, we discuss here covariance of the balance equations under simultaneous rotations of the referential and spatial coordinates,
c.f. [34, p. 156].

28

Linearized objectivity in eq.(5.1) is clear, since the curvature is deﬁned in terms of linear combinations of partial
derivatives of ε = sym Grad[u]. Moreover, since

Curlξ(sym{Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]}) = Gradξ[axl skew Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]] = Gradξ[axl skew (Q Gradx[u(x)] QT )]

= Gradξ[axl(Q ( skew Gradx[u(x)]) QT )] = Gradξ[Q (axl skew Gradx[u(x)])
]

= Gradξ[Q v(QT ξ)] = Q Gradx[v(x)] QT = Q (Gradx[axl skew Gradx[u(x)]])
= Q Curlx(sym Gradx[u(x)]) QT ,

(5.2)

|

:= v(x)

{z

}

eq.(4.21) yields

Thus, the curvature energy in eq.(5.1) is form-invariant since

Curlξ(sym{Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]}) = (ek♯(ξ))T = Q (ek(x))T QT .

k sym Curlξ (sym{Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]})k2 = k sym(ek♯(ξ)k2 = k sym Qek(x) QTk2 = k symek(x)k2

= k sym Curlx sym Gradx[u(x)]k2 .

(5.3)

(5.4)

5.1 Energetic considerations

Here, we consider (linearized) frame-indiﬀerent second gradient elasticity written in the reduced format27

W (Grad[u], GRAD[Grad[u]]) = W (sym Grad[u], GRAD[sym Grad[u]]) ,

(5.5)

where W is a quadratic form. Assuming the natural additive split

W (sym Grad[u], GRAD[sym Grad[u]]) = Wlin(sym Grad[u]) + Wcurv(GRAD[sym Grad[u]]) ,

(5.6)

we are interested in further reduced forms for isotropy. The reduced format for Wlin is nothing but isotropic
linear elasticity, in which isotropy is in eﬀect the requirement of form-invariance of

Wlin(sym Gradξ [u♯(ξ)])

Wlin(sym Gradx[u(x)]) ,

form−invariant

z}|{=

under the transformation (4.2). From eq.(5.7) we obtain the standard condition

Wlin(Q sym Grad[u] QT ) = Wlin(sym Grad[u])

∀ Q ∈ SO(3) ,

which implies, as is well-known, the representation

Wlin(sym Grad[u]) = µk sym Grad[u]k2 +

(5.7)

(5.8)

(5.9)

where µ, λ are the classical Lam´e-constants, and κ is the bulk modulus.

For the general curvature term in eq.(5.6) we require for isotropy the same formal form-invariance as in eq.(5.7),
namely

Wcurv(GRADξ [sym Gradξ[u♯(ξ)]])

Wcurv(GRADx[sym Gradx[u(x)]]) .

(5.10)

27Here,

it must be noted that W (sym Grad[u], Grad[Grad[u]]) is also (linearized) frame-indiﬀerent. The reduction to
is a linear combination of gra-
W (sym Grad[u], Grad[sym Grad[u]]) is possible since any second derivative Grad[Grad[u]]
dients of strain sym Grad[u].
there remains a subtle diﬀerence between W (sym Grad[u], Grad[Grad[u]]) and
W (sym Grad[u], Grad[sym Grad[u]]) in that formulations based on either expression may diﬀer in the higher order traction boundary
conditions while the energies coincide, see subsection 2.4.

However,

From eq.(4.8) and (4.35) we obtain

yielding

Wcurv(GRADx[sym Q Gradx[u(x)] QT ] QT ) = Wcurv(GRADx[sym Gradx[u(x)]])

(5.12)

in this general case of a strain gradient model.

In the case of the indeterminate couple stress model with symmetric total stress tensor we have that

and we obtain similarly the form-invariance condition

which implies

Wcurv(GRADx[sym Gradx[u(x)]]) =cWcurv(cid:0)(Curlxsym Gradx[u(x)])T(cid:1) ,
cWcurv((Curlxsym Gradx[u(x)])T ) ,

30

and this is an immediate consequence of (5.17). Considering condition (5.18) in the case of the theory without
higher gradients we have

Ψlin(sym Gradx[u(x)]) = Ψlin(cid:0)Q (sym Gradx[u(x)]) QT(cid:1)

∀Q ∈ SO(3)

(5.19)

and we may probe (5.19) also with non-constant rotation ﬁelds Q = Q(x) ∈ SO(3) without altering the imposed
invariance condition. However, it is important to realize that the adopted invariance requirement for isotropy
in higher-gradient materials via the ♯-transformation (5.17) does not allow for space dependent rotation ﬁelds
and the invariance condition for isotropy does not read

bΨlin(sym Gradx[u(x)] , GRADx[sym Gradx[u(x)]])
= bΨlin(cid:0)Q(x) (sym Gradx[u(x)]) QT (x) , GRADx[Q(x) (sym Gradx[u(x)]) QT (x)] QT (x)(cid:1) .

6 The isotropic linear indeterminate couple stress theory

(5.20)

This section does not contain new results but is included to connect our investigation of isotropy conditions
to speciﬁc models proposed in the literature. The linear indeterminate couple stress model is a speciﬁc second
gradient elastic model, in which the higher order interaction is restricted to the continuum rotation curl u,
where u : Ω 7→ R3 is the displacement of the body. It is therefore interpreted to be sensitive to rotations of
material points and it is possible to prescribe boundary conditions of rotational type.
Superﬁcially, this is the simplest possible generalization of linear elasticity in order to include the gradient
of the local continuum rotation as a source of additional strains and stress with an associated energy. In this
paper, therefore, we limit our analysis to isotropic materials and only to the second gradient of the displacement:

is the symmetric linear strain tensor. Thus, from eq.(6.1) all second derivatives of the displacement ﬁeld u
can be obtained from linear combinations of derivatives of ε. In general, strain gradient models do not intro-
duce additional independent degrees of freedoms30 aside the displacement ﬁeld u. Thus, the higher derivatives
introduce a “latent-microstructure” (constraint microstructure [21]). However, this apparent simplicity has to
be payed with more complicated and intransparent boundary conditions, as treated in a series of papers [33, 40].

admitting unique minimizers under some appropriate boundary condition. Here λ, µ are the Lam´e constitutive
coeﬃcients of isotropic linear elasticity, which is fundamental to small deformation gradient elasticity. If the
curvature energy has the form Wcurv(D2
xu) = Wcurv(Dx sym Gradx[u]), the model is called a strain gradient
model. We deﬁne the hyperstress tensor of third order as m = DD2
xu). Note that Div m is in general
not symmetric.

xuWcurv(D2

In the following we recall some curvature energies proposed in diﬀerent isotropic second gradient elasticity

models:

• the indeterminate couple stress model (Grioli-Koiter-Mindlin-Toupin model) [20, 1, 29, 36, 51, 47, 21]
in which the higher derivatives (apparently) appear only through derivatives of the inﬁnitesimal continuum
rotation curl u. Hence, the curvature energy has the equivalent forms

k2 ,

(6.13)

(6.14)

Although this energy admits the equivalent forms (6.13)1 and (6.13)2, the equations and the boundary
value problem of the indeterminate couple stress model is usually formulated only using the form (6.13)

of the energy. We remark that the spherical part of the couple stress tensor is zero since tr(2ek) =

tr(∇ curl u) = div(curl u) = 0 as seen before. In order to ensure the pointwise uniform positive deﬁniteness
it is assumed that α1 > 0, α3 > 0. Note that pointwise uniform positivity is often assumed [29] when
deriving analytical solutions for simple boundary value problems because it allows to invert the couple
stress-curvature relation.

• the modiﬁed symmetric couple stress model - the conformal model. On the other hand, in the
conformal case [43, 42] one may consider α3 = 0, which makes the couple stress tensor m symmetric and
trace free [8]. This conformal curvature case has been derived by Neﬀ in [43], the curvature energy having
the form

Wcurv(ek) = µ L2

c α1 k dev symekk2,

m = 2 µ L2

c α1 dev symek .

Indeed, there are two major reasons uncovered in [43] for using the modiﬁed couple stress model. First,
in order to avoid non physical singular stiﬀening behaviour for smaller and smaller samples in bending
[41] one has to take α3 = 0. Second, based on a homogenization procedure invoking a natural “micro-
randomness” assumption (a strong statement of microstructural isotropy) implies conformal invariance,
which is again α3 = 0. Such a modell is still well-posed [28] leading to existence and uniqueness results
with only one additional material length scale parameter, while it is not pointwise uniformly positive
deﬁnite.

(6.15)

• the skew-symmetric couple stress model. Hadjesfandiari and Dargush strongly advocate [22, 23, 24]

the opposite extreme case, α1 = 0 and α3 > 0, i.e. they used the curvature energy

Wcurv(ek) = µ L2

c

α3
4 k skew Grad[curl u]k2 = µ L2

c α3 k skewekk2 ,

m = 2 µ L2

(6.16)

c α3 skewek .

In that model the nonlocal force stress tesnor eτ is skew-symmetric and the couple stress tensor m is

assumed to be completely skew-symmetric. Their reasoning, based on boundary conditions, is critically
discussed in Neﬀ et al.[45].

6.2 A variant of the indeterminate couple stress model with symmetric total force

stress

In Ghiba et al.[19] the isotropic, linear indeterminate couple stress model has been modiﬁed so as to have

symmetric total force stress bσ, while retaining the same weak form of the Euler-Lagrange equations. This is

possible since the force stresses appearing in the balance of forces is only determined up to a self-equilibrated
stress-ﬁeld ¯σ, i.e.

The curvature energy expression of this new model is

Diveσ + f = 0 ⇔ Div (eσ + ¯σ) + f = 0 ,
c(α1 k dev sym Curl (sym Grad[u])k2 + α2 k skew Curl (sym Grad[u])k2) .

for any ¯σ with Div ¯σ = 0 .

Wcurv(D2

xu) = µ L2

The strong form of the new model reads

c(α1 dev sym Curl (sym Grad[u]) + α2 skew Curl (sym Grad[u])) .

total force stress

bτ = sym Curl (bm) ∈ Sym(3)

σ = 2 µ sym Grad[u] + λ tr(Grad[u])1 ,

bσ = σ +bτ ∈ Sym(3) ,

Divbσ + f = 0 ,
bm = 2 µ L2

(6.17)

(6.18)

(6.19)

The total force stress tensor is nowbσ = σ +bτ and the second order couple stress tensor is bm. Note that similarly
as in the indeterminate couple stress theory we have tr(bm) = 0. Compared to the indeterminate couple stress
theory on can show that Div (eσ −bσ) = 0, as claimed. Thus, eq.(6.19) is a couple stress model with symmetric
total force stress bσ and trace free couple stress tensor bm. Moreover, the couple stress tensor m is symmetric

itself for the possible choice α2 = 0.

6.3 The general strain gradient model

The strong form of the general strain gradient model reads

Div (σ + DIV m) + f = 0 ,

m third order hyperstress tensor

σ = 2 µ sym Grad[u] + λ tr(Grad[u])1 ,

˘τ = DIV m /∈ Sym(3)

˘σ = σ + ˘τ /∈ Sym(3) ,

Div ˘σ + f = 0

(6.20)

linear 6th order tensor.

For isotropy, it has been shown in [9] that L has 5 independent coeﬃcients.

7 Conclusions and outlook

We have investigated the isotropy requirements in elasticity theory by going back to the basic invariance re-
quirements under transformation of coordinates. In nonlinear elasticity it is important to observe the diﬀerence
between right-local SO(3)-invariance and right-global SO(3)-invariance. We have given examples that both
notions do not coincide in general and have shown another example where even right-local SO(3)-invariance is
satisﬁed. For us, isotropy is right-global SO(3)-invariance while right-local SO(3)-invariance is a stronger condi-
tion imposing more restrictive invariance requirements. Next, in linear theories (whether ﬁrst or second gradient

34

or indeed higher order gradient theories) deﬁned in the linearized frame-indiﬀerent object ε = sym Grad[u] and
gradients of it, isotropy can be probed by simultaneous rigid rotation of spatial and referential coordinates. We
have called this transformation the ♯-mapping. Isotropy then is equivalent to form-invariance of all energy
terms with respect to the ♯-transformation. Similarly, isotropy is equivalent to form-invariance of the balance
equations with respect to the ♯-transformation. We have investigated, in this respect, several variants of higher-
gradient models.

Our approach can be immediately extended to discuss anisotropy for higher gradient theories simply by requir-
ing form-invariance of the energy in the ♯-transformation not for all Q ∈ SO(3) (isotropy) but only for Q ∈ G
(material symmetry group). This will lead to very succinct statements of anisotropy for higher gradient models.

A.1 Overview

For the convenience of the reader we gather some further calculations in this appendix. We deﬁne the simulta-
neous change of spatial and referential coordinates by a rigid rotation

• for a scalar function

• for a vector

• for a tensor of second order

Note that the latter is motivated by

h♯(ξ) := h(QT ξ) ,

ϕ♯(ξ) := Q ϕ(QT ξ) ,

σ♯(ξ) := Q σ(QT ξ) QT .

ϕ♯(ξ) ⊗ ϕ♯(ξ) = Q ϕ(QT ξ) ⊗ Q ϕ(QT ξ) = Q [ϕ(QT ξ) ⊗ ϕ(QT ξ)] QT .

(A.1)

(A.2)

(A.3)

(A.4)

For a tensor of third order the standard symbolic notation is not suﬃcient to express the simultaneous change
of spatial and referential coordinates, which can be seen from

ϕ♯(ξ) ⊗ ϕ♯(ξ) ⊗ ϕ♯(ξ) = Q ϕ(QT ξ) ⊗ Q ϕ(QT ξ) ⊗ Q ϕ(QT ξ) = Q [ϕ(QT ξ) ⊗ ϕ(QT ξ)] QT ⊗ ϕ(QT ξ) QT .

(A.5)

It is not possible to separate the three rotations Q from a central dyadic product, such that e.g. m♯(ξ) =
Q m(QT ξ) QT QT does not hold true. Therefore, we need to use index notation in case of third order tensors
to be precise.

A.2 Quadratic norms

The quadratic norm of the second gradient of the displacement ﬁeld reads
k GRADx[Gradx[u(x)]]k2 = hua,bc ea ⊗ eb ⊗ ec , ui,jk ei ⊗ ej ⊗ eki = ua,bc ui,jk δai δbj δck = ua,bc ua,bc ,
which is form-invariant under our transformation since

which is also form-invariant under our transformation. Therefore, from eq.(A.8) and eq.(A.10) it follows that
k GRAD[dev(sym Grad[u(x)])]k2 is also form-invariant meaning that

k GRADξ [dev(sym Gradξ[u♯(ξ)])]k2 = k GRADx[dev(sym Gradx[u(x)])]k2 .
Further, the norm of the curl of the right Cauchy-Green tensor C = F T F is form-invariant:

A.3 Transformation law for Kr¨oner’s incompatibility tensor

We consider Kr¨oners’s incompatibility tensor inc(sym P ) := Curl(cid:0)(Curl sym P )T(cid:1) ∈ Sym(3) ⊆ R3×3. By

substituting σ♯(ξ) = sym P ♯(ξ) in eq.(4.33) we ﬁnd

CurlξCurlξ[sym P ♯(ξ)] = Curlξ[Q Curlx[sym P (x)] QT ] = Q Curlx[Curlx[sym P (x)]] QT ,

(A.13)

where eq.(4.22) yielding sym P ♯(ξ) = Q sym P (x) QT has been used. Finally we obtain

incξ(sym P ♯(ξ)) := Curlξ(cid:16)(Curlξ [sym P ♯(ξ)])T(cid:17) = Curlξ(cid:0)Q (Curlx[sym P (x)])T QT(cid:1)

= Q Curlx(cid:0)(Curlx[sym P (x)])T(cid:1) QT = Q incx(sym P (x)) QT .

(A.14)

Therefore, inc transforms similarly as any other second order tensor. Note again that inhomogeneous rotation
ﬁelds are not allowed in (A.14).

A.4 Transformation law for the dislocation density tensor
We also consider the dislocation density tensor Curl P ∈ R3×3. By looking back at eq.(4.32) we note

Curlξ [P ♯(ξ)] = Curlξ[Q P (QT ξ) QT ] = Q Curlξ[P (x) QT ] = Q Curlx[P (x)] QT ,

(A.15)

where again it is clear that the rotation Q must be homogeneous.

A.5 The Rayleigh product

The Rayleigh product [4, p. 46] for a (symmetric) second order tensor C is deﬁned by the algebraic operation

Following [3], where the Rayleigh product is deﬁned for arbitrary tensorial rank, it reads for a third order tensor
m

Q ∗ C := Qia Qjb Cab = Q C QT .

(A.16)

Q ∗ m := Qia Qjb Qkc mabc .

(A.17)

In contrast to [4, 5] we abstain from introducing symbolic notation in eq.(A.17). Note that the Rayleigh product
is the simple result of rotating the basis of any tensor component by Q in accordance with eq.(1.27). A triad
di ⊗ dj ⊗ dk from rotated basis vectors di = Q ei, dj = Q ej, and dk = Q ek reads

di ⊗ dj ⊗ dk = Q ∗ ei ⊗ ej ⊗ ek = Qia ea ⊗ Qjb eb ⊗ Qkc ec = Qia Qjb Qkc ea ⊗ eb ⊗ ec .

(A.18)

Note that the ♯-transformation generates the action of the Rayleigh-product when applied to objective quantities
like C. By now it is clear that we are not directly working on the level of (isotropic) scalar or tensor functions.
An algebraic characterization of isotropy for a reduced format of strain energies can be obtained with help
of the Rayleigh-product. Indeed, a free energy depending on a number of tensorial variables

Ψ = Ψ( C|{z}

2+n. order

induces an isotropic formulation if and only if

) = Ψ(C, GRADx[C], GRADx[GRADx[C]], . . .) ,

(A.19)

Ψ(Q(2)∗ C, Q(3)∗ ∇C, . . . , Q(2+n)∗ ∇nC) = Ψ(C, ∇C, ∇2C, . . . , ∇nC) ∀Q ∈ SO(3) ,

(A.20)

where Q(n) ∗ M denotes the Rayleigh product acting on n-th. order tensors.33 Similarly, for the linearized
kinematics, isotropy, and second strain gradient material we need to have

Ψlin(Q(2)∗ sym∇u, Q(3)∗ ∇ sym∇u) = Ψlin(sym∇u, ∇ sym∇u) ∀Q ∈ SO(3) .

(A.21)

As we have seen in the main body of this work, special gradient elasticity formulations employ certain reduced
representations. For these we note the isotropy conditions as well. For the indeterminate couple stress model
we obtain

Ψlin(Q(2)∗ sym∇u, Q(2)∗ ∇ axl( skew∇u)) = Ψlin(sym∇u, ∇ axl( skew∇u)) ∀Q ∈ SO(3) .

(A.22)

And for the version with symmetric stresses we get

Ψlin(Q(2)∗ sym∇u, Q(2)∗ Curl sym∇u) = Ψlin(sym∇u, Curl sym∇u) ∀Q ∈ SO(3) .

(A.23)

The following remark is in order. It is true that the second order tensor Curl sym∇u is a linear combination
of components of the third order tensor ∇ sym∇u. The isotropy condition based on ∇ sym∇u needs the
Rayleigh product with Q(3) (i.e. 3 rotations) in (A.21), while Curl sym∇u necessitates to take Q(2) in (A.23).
This apparent inconsistency is resolved by observing that Curl sym∇u is not just any linear combination of
∇ sym∇u, but such that it holds

Q(2)∗ Curl sym∇u = Q(2)∗bLCurl∇ sym∇u =bLCurl(Q(3)∗ ∇ sym∇u) ,

where bLCurl : R3×3×3 7→ R3×3 is such that
In general, for arbitrary L : R3×3×3 7→ R3×3

Curl sym∇u =bLCurl∇ sym∇u .
L(Q(3)∗ ∇ sym∇u) 6= Q(2)∗ L∇ sym∇u .

(A.24)

(A.25)

(A.26)

The same observation applies to ∇ axl( skew∇u) in (A.22).
33Since in this special representation the rotations are appearing already derivative free, the condition could be formulated

with inhomogeneous rotation ﬁelds without altering the result.
