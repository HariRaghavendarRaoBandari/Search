ABSTRACT

For studies of quark matter in astrophysical scenarios the thermodynamic bag model (tdBag) is
commonly employed. Although successful, it does not account for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking
(DχSB) and repulsions due to the vector interaction which is crucial to explain recent observations of
massive, two solar mass neutron stars. In Kl¨ahn & Fischer (2015) we developed the novel vBag quark
matter model which takes these eﬀects into account. This article extends vBag to ﬁnite temperatures
and isospin asymmetry. Another particular feature of vBag is the determination of the deconﬁnement
bag constant Bdc from a given hadronic equation of state (EoS) in order to ensure that chiral and
deconﬁnement transitions coincide. We discuss consequences of this novel approach for the phase
transition construction and the phase diagram.

1. INTRODUCTION

The theory of strong interactions, i.e. Quantum Chro-
modynamics (QCD), considers hadrons and mesons as
color neutral compound objects of quarks and gluons.
Besides conﬁnement a second key feature of QCD is
dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DχSB) and its
restoration at large densities and high temperatures.
Currently,
lattice-QCD is the only ab-initio approach
to solve QCD numerically (cf. Fodor & Katz 2004;
Aoki et al. 2006, and references therein).
In the vicin-
ity of vanishing chemical potentials lattice-QCD predicts
a cross-over phase transition for both deconﬁnement
and chiral symmetry breaking in the temperature range
150 < T < 170 MeV (the currently considered value
is 154 ± 9 MeV, cf. Bors´anyi et al. 2012; Bazavov et al.
2012a,b; Bazavov et al. 2014; Bors´anyi et al. 2014). This
predicted temperature is in agreement with hadron
freeze out data from heavy-ion collision experiments (cf.
Braun-Munzinger et al. 2015, and references therein).
However, lattice-QCD calculations are restricted to low
chemical potentials. On the other hand, in astrophysi-
cal systems, e.g., the interior of neutron stars and core
collapse supernovae, we usually encounter large chemical
potentials (or equivalently high densities even in excess
of normal nuclear density) and ﬁnite temperatures. Such
conditions are inaccessible by lattice-QCD and the cur-
rent generation of heavy-ion collision experiments.

The

two most

commonly used eﬀective quark
matter models
in astrophysics are the thermody-
namic bag model (tdBag) of Farhi & Jaﬀe (1984) and
models of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type (cf.
Nambu & Jona-Lasinio 1961; Klevansky 1992; Buballa
2005). Recently, we illustrated in Kl¨ahn & Fischer
(2015) that both approaches can be understood as lim-
iting solutions of QCD’s in-medium Dyson-Schwinger
gap equations within a particular set of approximations.
The advantage of the Dyson-Schwinger formalism is a
closer connection to QCD in comparison to the aforemen-

tioned phenomenological approaches. First explorations
of the EoS of deconﬁned quark matter within this ap-
proach have been performed (cf. Chen et al. 2008, 2011;
Chen et al. 2015; Kl¨ahn et al. 2010). Perturbative QCD
is valid in the limit of asymptotic freedom where quarks
are no longer strongly coupled (cf. Kurkela et al. 2014,
and references therein). Therefore, it provides a valu-
able benchmark for the asymptotic behaviour of realistic
quark matter model EoS.

Currently, no consistent approach exists to describe
medium properties of hadrons and mesons at the level
of quarks and gluons,
in particular at high density.
Hence, the deconﬁnement phase transition is usually con-
structed from a given hadronic EoS with hadrons and
mesons as the fundamental degrees of freedom and an
independently computed quark matter EoS. Construc-
tions based on Maxwell’s conditions by deﬁnition result
in a 1st-order phase transition (cf. Rischke et al. 1988;
Barz et al. 1989). In Fischer et al. (2011) a Gibbs con-
struction based on tdBag as the quark matter EoS at
ﬁnite temperatures has been employed for applications
in astrophysics. Yasutake et al. (2014) considered pasta-
structures at the quark-hadron interface and compared
the results with standard Maxwell and Gibbs construc-
tions. Further alternative approaches for the construc-
tion of possible quark-hadron phase transitions were dis-
cussed in Masuda et al. (2013) and in Kojo et al. (2015).
In Kl¨ahn & Fischer (2015) we introduced the novel
quark matter EoS vBag in particular for applications
in astrophysics. vBag accounts for DχSB and repul-
sive vector interactions explicitly. The latter property
is essential for a stiﬀening of the EoS towards high den-
sities and results in maximum neutron star masses in
agreement with the current constraint of about 2 M⊙
from the observations of Antoniadis et al. (2013) and
Demorest et al. (2010), the latter recently revised to
1.928 ± 0.017 M⊙ by Fonseca et al. (2016). Moreover,
vBag mimics (de)conﬁnement via a phenomenological

2

correction to the EoS. It is determined by the hadronic
EoS chosen for the construction of the phase transition
and it ensures that chiral and deconﬁnement phase tran-
sitions coincide, which is generally not provided for a
‘standard’ Maxwell or Gibbs construction which is usu-
ally based on independent hadronic and quark matter
EoS.

In this article we extend vBag to ﬁnite tempera-
tures and isospin asymmetry. As a consequence of our
model prescription the deconﬁnement bag constant Bdc
is medium dependent and closely related to the hadronic
EoS. For illustration we select a nuclear EoS from
the catalogue of Hempel & Schaﬀner-Bielich (2010). It
treats the nuclear medium within a quasi-particle pic-
ture of the relativistic mean-ﬁeld (RMF) framework
for conditions in excess of normal nuclear matter den-
sity and high temperatures.
Speciﬁcally, we choose
the parametrization DD2 from Typel et al. (2010). We
aim to make vBag accessible to a broader spectrum
of astrophysics applications where the appearance of
quark matter can be studied, e.g., simulations of neutron
star mergers, core collapse supernovae and protoneu-
tron star cooling (cf. Pons et al. 2001; Sagert et al. 2009;
Nakazato et al. 2008; Fischer et al. 2011).

In Sec. 2 we review the basic equations of vBag in-
cluding novel aspects due to the extension to ﬁnite tem-
perature and isospin asymmetry.
In Sec. 3 we con-
struct the hybrid EoS HS(DD2)–vBag based on a quark
matter EoS parametrization that was already used in
Kl¨ahn & Fischer (2015). We describe the resulting phase
diagram and diﬀerences to the standard approach for the
construction of the phase transition. In Sec. 4 we discuss
limitations of this study and close the manuscript with
the summary in Sec. 5.

2. VBAG AS A HYBRID APPROACH

2.1. Chiral symmetry and vector interaction

In Kl¨ahn & Fischer (2015) we introduced the vBag
model as an extension of tdBag, which in turn was in-
troduced in Farhi & Jaﬀe (1984). As typical for quasi-
particle approaches the thermodynamical behavior of
vBag is fully expressed in terms of non-interacting Fermi
gas integrals. The model considers only the chirally re-
stored phase where the quark mass is well approximated
by the bare quark mass. Despite this similarity to the
standard bag model vBag accounts explicitly for the re-
pulsive vector interaction and the dynamical breaking
of chiral symmetry at a critical chemical potential µχ,f ,
where f denotes the quark ﬂavor.

For µf < µχ,f chiral symmetry is broken and we as-
sume that quarks are conﬁned in hadron and meson
states which are not accessible for vBag. The chiral phase
transition and the corresponding critical chemical poten-
tial µχ,f is deﬁned by the value of the chiral bag constant
Bχ, demanding that at µf = µχ,f the pressure of a single
quark ﬂavor, that is given as

Pf (µf ) = P kin

FG,f (µ∗

f ) +

Kv
2

n2
FG,f (µ∗

f ) − Bχ,f ,

(1)

turns positive (for
(1) of
Kl¨ahn & Fischer (2015)). Bχ,f is a ﬂavor dependent pa-
rameter which can be computed from a microscopic ap-
proach as the diﬀerence between the vacuum pressure of

illustrations cf.

Fig.

the chirally broken and the chirally restored phase.

As this prescription is applied for each ﬂavor inde-
pendently it would result in sequential chiral transitions
of light and heavy quarks (more details are given in
Kl¨ahn & Fischer 2015). We return to this point at the
discussion of the phase transition in Sec. 3.

The constant Kv in the second term in Eq. (1) re-
lates directly to the coupling strength Gv of the vec-
tor current-current interaction as one would deﬁne it
in NJL type models. As explained in more detail in
Kl¨ahn & Fischer (2015), Bχ,f (besides the regularization
scheme and involved parameters) depends on a corre-
sponding scalar coupling constant Gs which itself relates
to Gv by Gv = Gs/2. Hence, Kv and Bχ,f are not strictly
independent quantities. However, as the latter relation
is not expected to hold strictly in a realistic model we
consider these two as rather independent model parame-
ters of vBag. A consequence of accounting for the vector
interaction which leads beyond the tdBag model is the
appearance of the eﬀective chemical potential µ∗
f which
enters all Fermi gas expressions. The actual chemical
potential µf in the sense of a thermodynamic variable is
determined post-priori as

µf = µ∗

f + KvnFG,f (µ∗

f ) .

(2)

This again is common for quasi-particle models where in-
teractions dynamically alter particle in-medium proper-
ties, e.g., mass and chemical potential but not the struc-
ture of the Fermi integrals.

With Eqs. (1) and (2) the EoS at zero temperature
is given and the two relations can be used to determine
the energy density and quark number density of a given
ﬂavor,

εf (µf ) = εkin

FG,f (µ∗
nf (µf ) = nFG,f (µ∗

f ) +

f ) .

Kv
2

n2
FG,f (µ∗

f ) + Bχ,f ,

(3)

(4)

To extend the model to ﬁnite temperatures we replace
the zero temperature Fermi-gas integrals by the equiva-
lent ﬁnite temperature expressions. The entropy density
of the system is expressed in the quasi-particle picture
again,

sf (T, µf ) =

∂Pf (T, µf )

∂T

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)µf

= sFG,f (T, µ∗

f ).

(5)

One easily veriﬁes the Euler equation ε + P = µn + T s
to be fulﬁlled. Notice, that in this study we assume a
constant, medium independent Bχ,f . This is not a per-
fect or in general correct choice – the scalar condensate
is known to melt with increasing temperature – and we
assume for the moment not to reach high enough tem-
peratures to induce signiﬁcant changes of the pressure
due to this melting. We brieﬂy discuss the limitations of
this assumption in Sec. 4.

2.2. Deconﬁnement

The previous section described how vBag accounts for
the repulsive vector interaction and the chiral phase tran-
sition of a single quark ﬂavor. These results can be
perfectly understood in terms of a simple NJL model
or more general in the framework of Dyson-Schwinger

model studies assuming an underlying gluon contact in-
teraction as illustrated in Kl¨ahn & Fischer (2015). vBag
is a limit of these models in the chirally restored phase
assuming that in this domain the bare quark mass is a
suﬃcient approximation of the real mass gap solutions
to describe the thermodynamical behavior of chirally re-
stored quark matter. The condition Pf (µχ,f ) = 0 which
determines µχ,f does not imply that the chiral bag con-
stant describes the pressure under a conﬁning force but
simply accounts for the fact that chiral symmetry in con-
ﬁned matter is broken and subsequently the restoration
of chiral symmetry induces pressure to the system.

If the chiral symmetry restoration takes place in con-
ﬁned hadronic matter it is worth to consider the follow-
ing two aspects: First, a description of hadronic matter
that does not take chiral symmetry breaking on the quark
level into account is likely inaccurate. It is ﬂawed already
on the level of the ‘fundamental’ bare hadron masses
independently from the speciﬁc modeling of nucleon-
nucleon interactions. Second, hadronic matter will de-
conﬁne after the system reaches a suﬃcient critical chem-
ical potential µB,dc and related pressure. It is a common
approach to describe hybrid nuclear-quark EoS including
the chiral/deconﬁnement transition without giving any
of these two statements too many thoughts by perform-
ing a Maxwell or Gibbs construction to connect nuclear
and quark EoS; both EoS can be – and in astrophysical
applications usually are – obtained from diﬀerent, inde-
pendent models.

We now aim to model a hybrid, nuclear–light-quark
EoS for applications at ﬁnite temperature and arbitrary
isospin-asymmety. While an extension to ﬁnite tempera-
tures is easily achieved, isospin-asymmetry, i.e. µu 6= µd
raises the problem that diﬀerent light quark chemical po-
tentials imply situations where, e.g., µd < µχ,(u,d) < µu,
and consequently u-quarks are chirally restored while d-
quarks are not. This can lead to interesting scenarios (cf.
Blaschke et al. 2009). However, in this work we model
an EoS where light ﬂavors appear at the same critical
baryon chemical potential in analogy to the results ob-
tained with the ‘standard’ approach for ﬁrst order phase
transitions. To achieve this we redeﬁne the chiral thresh-
old condition to hold for the total light quark pressure
instead for each single ﬂavor independently,

Pf (T, µχ,f ) = 0 .

(6)

X

f =u,d

Here, Pf (T, µf ) is deﬁned as the total quark pressure of
a single quark ﬂavor according to Eq. (1).

It is useful to introduce the baryon and charge chemical
potentials for light quark matter, which follow in general
from µf = Bf µB + Qf µC , with Bf and Qf being the
baryon and electric charge number of the corresponding
quark ﬂavor f . This allows us to rewrite

µB = µu + 2µd,
µC = µu − µd.

(7)
(8)

At given T and µC we denote our critical chemical po-
tentials for DχSB and conﬁnement as µB,χ and µB,dc
respectively. The general thermodynamic identities,

∂P
∂µB

= nB ,

∂P
∂µC

∂P
∂T

= s ,

(9)

3

relate the pressure derivatives with respect to the bary-
onic and charge chemical potentials to the baryon and
charge number densities as well as the temperature
derivative to the entropy.

In this work, we assume that at least at suﬃciently low
temperatures the assumption of a ﬁrst order transition is
correct. The condition for the transition from hadronic
(H) to quark matter (Q) for the total pressure of each
phase reads P H (µB,dc) = P Q(µB,dc) at given T and µC .
It deﬁnes the deconﬁnement baryonic chemical potential
µB,dc. We observe: (i) evidently deconﬁnement occurs
at ﬁnite pressure, and (ii) without further modiﬁcations
Eq. (1) enforces zero pressure at the chiral transition.
Hence, chiral and deconﬁnement transition are necessar-
ily located at diﬀerent chemical potentials, µB,χ < µB,dc.
In fact, the gap between these critical chemical potentials
easily spans several 100 MeV. The gap region in this 2-
phase approach is constructed by comparing a nuclear
matter EoS which does not know about chiral symme-
try breaking on the quark level with a quark matter EoS
which does not know about conﬁnement. The thermody-
namically favored solution in this domain is the hadron
EoS (blind to the restoration of chiral symmetry on the
quark level) due to its higher pressure, and hence the chi-
ral restoration of quark matter is eﬀectively postponed
ad hoc until µB,dc is reached. Note, that in this line
of argumentation µB,χ is eﬀectively increased to match
µB,dc for the price that it is assumed to be larger than
the chiral quark model actually predicts.

We go the opposite way and want our model to ac-
count for chiral symmetry breaking and the conﬁnement
transition simultaneously at µB,χ. To do this µB,dc has
to decrease and match µB,χ in agreement with Eq. (1).
This is achieved by exploiting that the total pressure of
our system is ﬁxed by the previous equations only up to
a constant Bdc,

P Q = X

Pf (T, µf ) + Bdc.

(10)

f

Introducing Bdc thus enables us to ensure that the pres-
sure of hadronic and quark matter equals at the crit-
ical chemical potential µB,χ for the chiral transition.
In order to match both pressures one easily ﬁnds the
value of Bdc = P H (µB,χ) at given T and µC. In gen-
eral, we expect Bdc to depend on all thermodynamic
variables, T , µC , and µB. However, our prescription
ﬁxes Bdc only on a hyper-surface within this three-
dimensional parameter space which leaves one free vari-
able and the corresponding dependence of Bdc remains
undetermined. We eliminate this degree of freedom
by assuming Bdc(T, µC, µB) = Bdc(T, µC , µB,χ), where
µB,χ itself is a function of T and µC .

There is evidence but no strict proof that chiral sym-
metry breaking and deconﬁnement are tied to the same
or close values of the corresponding critical chemical po-
tentials. Whether this will be supported by future re-
search or not, the previous paragraph outlined that both
approaches we described imply µB,χ = µB,dc; the tradi-
tional phase transition construction of two independent
phases by shifting µB,χ → µB,dc, the Bdc approach by
shifting µB,dc → µB,χ. We prefer the latter as it keeps
the insights from a chiral description on the quark level
and as we show in the following results in an inherent

connection of nuclear and quark EoS that goes beyond
the ‘standard’ two-phase approach. vBag does not re-
quire this procedure, and in principle we could obtain
any value for µB,dc with a corresponding choice of Bdc.
However, the problem of an existing domain where the
favored nuclear EoS is blind to the restoration of chiral
symmetry on the quark level would still stand.

Ignoring the vector interaction induced terms for the
moment, vBag behaves very similar to the thermody-
namic bag model as it results in an eﬀective bag con-
stant

Kl¨ahn & Fischer (2015).

As outlined earlier the deconﬁnement bag constant Bdc
depends on the nuclear EoS. According to our prescrip-
tion for the phase transition it will vary with tempera-
ture and asymmetry, Bdc → Bdc(T, µC ), while we keep it
constant with respect to µB. This medium dependence
of Bdc results in additional contributions to the charge
number and entropy density,

which takes similar values as one is used to from the
bag model. We emphasize that unlike for the stan-
dard bag model in vBag the positive value of Beﬀ orig-
inates from DχSB only, while conﬁnement reduces it.
In this sense Bdc is understood as a conﬁning binding
energy. Moreover, Beﬀ can take values smaller than in
the thermodynamic bag model without predicting de-
conﬁned (light)-quark matter to be energetically favored
over nuclear matter. This is explained in more detail in

with ˜nQ

dent phases. One obtains

At µC = 0 one has isospin symmetric matter and hence
C = ˜Y Q
Y H
C = 0.5 (with the charge fractions YC de-
ﬁned as nC /nB), which implies nC,dc(T, µC = 0) = 0.
Similary at T = 0 holds sH = ˜sQ = 0 and thus
sdc(T = 0, µC ) = 0.
It is evident that the deﬁni-
tion of Bdc(T, µC ) := PH (T, µC , µB,χ) entangles vBag
with the hadron EoS (labeled H). In this very aspect
the ﬁnite temperature and isospin asymmetry extension
of vBag(T, µC) diﬀers from the T = 0 case vBag dis-
cussed in Kl¨ahn & Fischer (2015). While the procedure
does not induce a deconﬁnement baryon density,
i.e.,
B = ˜nQ

3 (nu + nd), one has to
take corrections to the energy density into account,

B = Pf =u,d Bf nf = 1

εQ(T, µC, µB) = ˜εQ(T, µC , µB) − Bdc(T, µC)

+ T sdc(T, µC) + µC nC,dc(T, µC) ,(16)
with ˜εQ = Pf =u,d εf . The correction terms we name
as the deconﬁnement energy density, εdc(T, µC ) =
T sdc(T, µC ) + µC nC,dc(T, µC). In Sec. 3 we will evaluate
this correction to the total energy density in relation to
˜εQ.

3. PHASE DIAGRAM

Fig. 1 illustrates the diﬀerence of our approach to the
‘standard’ phase transition construction. We choose a
point in the phase diagram (µB = 1125 MeV, µC = −150
MeV, T = 30 MeV) and examine the pressure depen-
dence to changes of one of these variables.
In general
the vector coupling is set to zero except for set (a) where
we show two cases, Kv=0 and Kv = 2 × 10−6 MeV−2.
Note, that only quarks, neutrons and protons are consid-

We refer to the ‘standard’ phase transition construc-
tion as a prescription that takes the EoS of both phases
as independent input and favors the phase with higher
pressure at given chemical potential. Such a model is
represented by the green line in Fig. 1, where the light
quark single ﬂavor chiral bag constant has a value of
B1/4
χ = 152.7 MeV (see Table 1 in Kl¨ahn & Fischer
(2015)) while we set Bdc ≡ 0, thus reproducing the
underlying NJL model. Here, the model predicts the
restoration of chiral symmetry at µB,χ ≈ 1150 MeV
deﬁned by the condition P Q(µB,χ, µC, T ) = 0. How-
ever, deconﬁnement as the transition from nuclear to
quark matter occurs at higher chemical potential (as
P H (µB,dc) = P Q(µB,dc) > 0), in this particular case
at µB,dc ≈ 1400 MeV. For all µB < µB,dc HS(DD2) is
determined as the thermodynamically favored EoS, al-
though the quark matter model predicts the restoration
of chiral symmetry on the quark level already at a signif-
icantly lower value. The restoration of chiral symmetry
is by construction not accounted for by HS(DD2)2.

In our approach we mimic conﬁnement by introduc-
ing Bdc(T, µC) = P H (T, µC , µB = µB,χ) as a positive
shift of the quark pressure as discussed in the previous
section, and therefore (i) lower the onset of deconﬁne-
ment µB,dc → µB,χ, and (ii) do not favor the nuclear
EoS in a region where the dressed nucleon mass due to
DχSB should be lower than HS(DD2) accounts for. The
result of our approach is illustrated by the solid blue
line in Fig. 1. As we wish to study the consequences of
our approach for the QCD phase transition in the phase
diagram we ignore the inﬂuence of vector coupling de-

If a quarkyonic phase (cf. McLerran & Pisarski 2007;
McLerran et al. 2009; Andronic et al. 2010) existed for µB,χ <
µB < µB,dc this would require to reformulate the nuclear RMF
approach underlying HS(DDS) to account for medium dependent

pendent terms in our model. The reason is easily under-
stood from the red dashed line in the same ﬁgure. Here
we chose a typical value for the vector coupling constant,
Kv = 2 × 10−6 MeV−2. Although the thermodynamic
correction terms induced by the vector interaction do vis-
ibly play an important role at higher densities they have
an almost negligible inﬂuence on the position of µB,χ and
the thermodynamical quantities at this value.

Fig. 5.— Temperature dependence of the deconﬁnement bag con-
stant for varying chiral bag constants Bχ in symmetric matter
(µC = 0).

The lower left panel of Fig. 1 translates the chemical
potential from the upper left panel into corresponding
baryon number densities. Both, the onset baryon densi-
ties of the mixed phase (nB,0) and of pure quark matter
(nB,χ) are shifted to smaller densities, and the phase co-
existence region [nB,0, nB,χ] shrinks in comparison to the
standard approach. Our construction implies that nB,χ
depends only on the chiral quark model (nB,χ is the slope
of P Q(µB) with respect to µB at µB,χ. Bdc does not de-
pend on µB and consequently does not contribute to nB),
while nB,0 is sensitive to both, the nuclear and quark
matter EoS, as µB,dc = µB,χ and nB,0 = nH
B (µB,dc). We
consider the eﬀect as dramatic. While the ‘standard’ ap-
proach predicts an onset of the phase transition at about
3.5 nS, our approach shifts the onset close to 2.5 nS (the
saturation density for HS(DD2) is nS = 0.155 fm−3).
Further, the density range covered by the phase coexis-
tence region (visible as a plateau in the lower panel of
Fig. 1) is reduced from 2 nS to less than 0.5 nS. Qualita-
tively we ﬁnd this shift of the phase transition towards
smaller values for all thermodynamic degrees of freedom
(µB, µC , and T) together with a narrowing of the transi-
B, nQ
tion region in terms of the conjugated quantities (nQ
C ,
sQ). This is illustrated in the remaining panels of Fig. 1.
While the phase transition along the temperature axis
(b) behaves qualitatively similar to what we observe in
dependence of the baryochemical potential (a) we notice
a sequence of two phase transitions (quark to hadron (I)
and hadron to quark (II)) along the axis of the electronic
chemical potential in column (c).

We further illustrate the diﬀerences of our and the
‘standard’ approach by showing the phase boundary at

ﬁnite temperatures and chemical potentials for two se-
lected values of the charge chemical potential (µC =
(−200, 0) MeV) in Fig. 2. As to be expected µB,χ reduces
with increasing temperature. Moreover, our approach
suggests a widening of the instability region in terms of
density with increasing temperature while the ‘standard’
approach describes a narrowing. This is related to the
diﬀerent temperature behavior of HS(DD2) and vBag,
with a faster softening for the hadronic EoS. In our ap-
proach the upper border of the instability region (solid
black and red lines in panel (b)) is exclusively deﬁned
by the chiral transition line predicted by vBag. In the
standard approach, the restoration of chiral symmetry is
explicitly ignored and unlike to vBag the upper border
of the transition region is inﬂuenced by the underlying
nuclear matter EoS. In comparison to the diﬀerences due
to a diﬀerent modeling of the phase transition only small
variations in terms of µB,χ and ρχ are found for varying

Kv (see Fig. 1) or the isospin asymmetry (Fig. 2).

The signiﬁcant changes of location and width of the
phase transition region are a direct result of the introduc-
tion of the medium dependent deconﬁnement bag con-
stant Bdc. As stated earlier it maps the nuclear EoS at
µB,χ in order to align chiral and deconﬁnement phase
transition. The critical chemical potential for the chiral
transition depends on the particular value for the chi-
ral bag constant Bχ, the temperature T and the isospin
In Figs. 3 and 4 we illustrate the depen-
asymmetry.
dence of Bdc on temperature and charge chemical po-
tential. For any choice of Bχ (we further discuss this
model dependence in Sec. 4) it decreases with increasing
temperature. Simultaneously the critical baryo-chemical
potential decreases. The related critical temperature
where the phase transition line hits the temperature axis
dependends on Bχ and is indicated together with the
corrsponding value of Bdc by ﬁlled circles in Fig. 5.

8

By construction, Bdc corresponds to the pressure of
the hadronic and the quark phase at the phase transi-
tion. Therefore, Figs. 3, 4, and 5 can also be interpreted
as pressure-temperature,
respectively pressure-charge
chemical potential phase diagrams. The fact that Bdc is
decreasing with temperature implies dP/dT |P T,µC
< 0
which is opposite to the behavior in the nuclear liquid-gas
phase transition, sometimes called an “entropic” phase
transition (cf. Hempel et al. 2013; Iosilevskiy 2013, 2015,
and references therein). This property could lead to in-
teresting consequences for neutron stars and core collapse
supernovae (Yudin et al. 2016; Hempel et al. 2015).

According to our interpretation Bdc is a measure of
the binding energy of quarks in conﬁned hadrons. The
decreasing of this quantity with increasing tempera-
ture indicates nicely that the system indeed becomes
less bound. Of course, the Maxwell-like approach and
resulting ﬁrst order transition are not an appropriate
choice in this domain where a cross-over transition is
expected. This happens in vicinity to the critical tem-
perature 150 < Tc < 170 MeV (cf. Bors´anyi et al. 2012;
Bazavov et al. 2012a,b; Bors´anyi et al. 2014). Our model
is not designed to describe a cross-over phase transition
and for this reason should not be applied at temperatures
where one would expect the critical end point and be-
yond. However, the drastic decrease of Bdc with increas-
ing temperature (it is rather insensitive to the isospin
asymmetry as we illustrate in Fig. 4) conﬁrms our inter-
pretation of Bdc as conﬁning binding energy.

Although derivative terms due to the isospin asym-
metry and temperature dependence of Bdc, Eqs. (14)
and (15) respectively, play no role in determining the
phase transition surface (in terms of µB, µC , and T ),
they enter the EoS as they contribute to charge den-
sity (12), entropy (13) and energy density (16). For
the total energy density of quark matter we introduced
εQ = ˜εQ + Bdc + εdc where εdc accounts for all medium
dependent corrections due to derivative terms of Bdc.
The resulting relative deviation on the phase transition
hypersurface we deﬁne as Rε = εdc/εQ. These correc-
tion terms become smaller when going to higher values
of µB > µB,χ, and go to zero for µB → ∞; Rε repre-
sents the maximal contribution of the correction terms
to the energy density. The upper left panel of Fig. 6
illustrates that it is always negative and that the magni-
tude of these corrections is relatively small compared to
the dominant direct contribution of Bdc to εQ. As ex-
pected, at low temperatures and small isospin asymme-
try Rε turns neglible small. Even with increasing tem-
perature and isospin asymmetry it remains small with
values up to a magnitude of 10%. However, the oppo-
site is true for derivative corrections to the entropy and
charge fraction. The top right panel of Fig. 6 shows the
relative contribution of the derivative term of Bdc with
respect to T to the total entropy density, Rs = sdc/sQ,
which is always negative. While this quantity can reach
a value of minus one at small temperatures, thus reduc-
ing the total entropy by a factor of one, one has to keep
in mind that at low temperature the entropy is small
and hence this is a large relative modiﬁcation of a quan-
tity with small value. However, at intermediate temper-
atures the changes of the entropy due to the medium
dependence of Bdc are far from being negligible. The

B = ˜Y Q

situation turns even more extreme for the charge density
nQ
C = ˜nQ
C + nC,dc or the corresponding charge fractions
Y Q
C /nQ
C = nQ
C + YC,dc. The bottom left panel of
Fig. 6 illustrates that derivate corrections vanish for val-
ues of µC close to zero. However, with more negative
values of µC the correction term YC,dc can reach values
of up to 0.5. For the total charge fraction (bottom right
panel) this results in signiﬁcant changes, generally shift-
ing the charge fraction towards more positive values.

4. MODEL LIMITATIONS

We motivated that the deconﬁnement bag constant has
a temperature and isospin dependence which is implic-
itly given via the hadronic EoS. The chiral condensate
and therefore the bag constant Bχ should show an ex-
plicit temperature dependence as well. We neglect such
dependencies and assume the same ﬁxed value for Bχ at
all T and study the impact of varying conditions for the
chiral transition to construct our phase diagrams. Fig. 7
illustrates that with decreasing Bχ also µB,χ and nB,χ
will reduce substantially. It is formally not diﬃcult to
rewrite our approach for a fully medium dependent chi-
ral bag constant Bχ. However, modeling a meaningful
medium dependence requires a more elaborate approach
than our phenomenological model. We therefore leave
this important issue for future investigations.
In ad-
dition, the hadronic EoS HS(DD2) is not an adequate

choice at large temperatures and small chemical poten-
tials to study the QCD phase transition as in particular
in the transition domain the thermally excited pion gas
and additional nuclear resonances have to be taken into
account.

5. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

In this article we introduced an important extension
of the recently introduced quark matter EOS vBag (for
details, see Kl¨ahn & Fischer 2015) to ﬁnite temperature
and arbitrary isospin asymmetry. As an extension of td-
Bag it takes DχSB explicitly into account in terms of the
chiral bag constant Bχ. It imposes the restoration of chi-
ral symmetry at an associated critical chemical potential
(µB,χ). This ﬁrst model parameter is complemented by a
second one, Kv, which is the vector coupling constant due
to repulsive vector interactions – not included in tdBag –
which stiﬀens the EoS with increasing density. The last
main characteristics of vBag is the inherent connection
to a given hadronic EoS in terms of the deconﬁnement
bag constant (Bdc). It is determined entirely by the chi-
ral transition and a selected hadronic EoS – and in this
sense is not a free parameter of vBag. With this pro-
cedure we assure that chiral and deconﬁnement phase
transitions coincide, assuming that the transition is of
ﬁrst order.

With vBag and the extension to ﬁnite tempera-
tures and isospin asymmetry we provide a novel quark-
matter EoS for a broad spectrum of applications in
astrophysics, e.g., simulations of neutron star merg-
ers, core collapse supernovae and protoneutron star
cooling, where commonly the simple tdBag-model has
been employed (cf. Pons et al. 2001; Sagert et al. 2009;
Nakazato et al. 2008; Fischer et al. 2011, and references
therein). tdBag does not account for chiral physics and
without perturbative corrections violates the 2 M⊙ neu-
tron star mass constraint due to missing repulsive inter-
actions. Here, vBag provides solutions that cure both
problems without losing the simplicity and ﬂexibility of
tdBag.

A natural consequence of the extension to ﬁnite tem-
peratures and isospin asymmetry is the emergence of an
implicit temperature and isospin asymmetry dependence
of the deconﬁnement bag constant, Bdc(T, µC ). It is de-
termined by the pressure of the hadronic EoS at the chi-
ral transition.
In addition, corrections to entropy and
charge density arise from a thermodynamically consis-
tent treatment. The phase transition surface in the phase
diagram (in terms of µB, µC , and T ) is independent from
these correction terms. Furthermore, the resulting cor-

9

rections to the energy density are small while we ﬁnd sig-
niﬁcant contributions to the entropy density and charge
fraction of quark matter due to derivative terms result-
ing from the medium dependence of Bdc. Overall we ﬁnd
that a simultaneous chiral symmetry restoration and de-
conﬁnement make the quark phase more similar to the
hadronic phase regarding its temperature and asymme-
try dependence.

The hybrid EoS is constructed based on our choice of
the nuclear RMF EoS HS(DD2). Starting from the as-
sumption µB,dc = µB,χ the phase boundary in the phase
diagram shows distinct diﬀerences to the common ap-
proach which is used in astrophysics. The standard pro-
cedure results in signiﬁcantly higher transition densities
than our approach with ﬁnite Bdc. Moreover, we ﬁnd
a diﬀerent behavior of the phase boundary towards in-
creasing temperatures. The coexistence region between
the onset of quark matter and pure quark matter broad-
ens, unlike to the ‘standard’ approach. Since the decon-
ﬁnement bag constant maps the pressure of the hadronic
EoS at the transition line,
its medium dependence is
represented by the hadronic EoS entirely.
It decreases
with increasing temperature and rather weakly depends
on the isospin asymmetry. Furthermore, we brieﬂy dis-
cussed the expected impact of a temperature dependent
chiral bag constant by choosing diﬀerent values of Bχ.
The phase boundaries shift to lower(higher) densities for
lower(larger) values of Bχ. This important aspect will
be further explored in future studies, as it is beyond the
scope of the presented article.

At temperatures in excess of about 100 MeV we are
leaving the domain of validity of our purely nucleonic
EoS; nuclear resonances and mesons such as the pion are
not explicitly included in the description of the hadronic
medium of HS(DD2). Nevertheless, the qualitative be-
havior of the vBag phase boundary seems to be in agree-
ment with predictions of lattice QCD and data from
heavy-ion collision experiments with one important ex-
ception: the phase transition we describe in our approach
is by construction always of 1st-order.
