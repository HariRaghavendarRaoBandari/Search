A major breakthrough in our understanding of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) prompt emis-
sion physics occurred in the last few years, with the realization that a thermal component
accompanies the over-all non-thermal prompt spectra. This thermal part is important
by itself, as it provides direct probe of the physics in the innermost outﬂow regions.
It further has an indirect importance, as a source of seed photons for inverse-Compton
scattering, thereby it contributs to the non-thermal part as well. In this short review, we
highlight some key recent developments. Observationally, although so far it was clearly
identiﬁed only in a minority of bursts, there are indirect evidence that thermal com-
ponent exists in a very large fraction of GRBs, possibly close to 100%. Theoretically,
the existence of thermal component have a large number of implications as a probe of
underlying GRB physics. Some surprising implications include its use as a probe of the
jet dynamics, geometry and magnetization.

1. Introduction

Our understanding of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) prompt emission have been revo-
lutionized in the past few years. This is thanks to new observatories, in particular
the Swift and Fermi satellites, new methods of data analysis, and new theoretical
ideas of interpreting these results. As a result of these progresses, we think that it is
fair to claim that we reached a point in time where we are witnessing a ’paradigm
shift’ in our understanding of this phenomena. A major part of this paradigm shift
is attributed to the realization that a thermal component exists in a large fraction
of GRBs, and the realization of its importance as providing a new tool to study the
underlying GRB physics.

This rapid progress in this ﬁeld manifests itself in a large number of excellent
reviews that were written in the last few years. A partial list of reviews that were
published only in the last ﬁve years include reviews by references.1–10 This short
review is not aimed at competing with any of the above, but rather to highlight
one aspect of the progress, which we ﬁnd of particular importance: that of thermal
emission component that is observed during the prompt phase of many GRBs. There
are currently good reasons to believe that such a component in fact exists in many
GRBs in which it is not directly observed, the reason for this being its distortion by
various processes. As we will discuss here, this component, whether independently

as well as in combination with other, non-thermal parts of the spectra, provides a
wealth of novel ways of interpreting and understanding the data. It can be used to
study underlying physical properties of the GRB outﬂow such as the jet geometry
or jet magnetization, that do not seem, at ﬁrst sight, to be related to thermal
emission. As a consequence, it may very well hold the key to a more complete
understanding of the underlying physics of the chain of events that eventually results
in the production of a GRB.

We begin this review by a short historical overview in section 2. We then discuss
the current observational status in section 3, and present theoretical ideas in section
4. We summarize and conclude in section 5.

2. Historical overview

Interestingly, the very ﬁrst works in which it was realized that GRBs are of cosmo-
logical origin, proposed that the emission should be (quasi)-thermal.11–16 This idea
originates from the realization that the huge amount of energy, >∼ 1053 erg released
in a small volume, of typical size r ∼ 107 − 108 cm (that is deduced from light
crossing time arguments and the rapid, >∼ ms variability observed) must result in
an extremely high optical depth to scattering by particles in the plasma. The rapid
interactions between the energetic photons and particles / low energy photons (in
producing pairs) lead to the formation of a “ﬁreball”, similar in nature to the early
evolution of the expanding universe.17 In this regime of optical depth τ ≫ 1, all
emerging radiation must be thermal. The observed spectrum, though, was predicted
to be somewhat distorted from a pure “Planck” function, due to light aberration
eﬀects in the relativistically expanding winds (see Ref. 11).

These ideas could be tested in the early 1990’s, following the launch of the
Compton gamma ray observatory (CGRO) in 1991 that led to the accumulation of
detailed spectral data. Contrary to the initial expectations, CGRO spectral data
was found to be inconsistent with the initial predictions. Data accumulated mainly
by the BATSE instrument on board the CGRO showed clearly that the observed
spectral shape of the vast majority of GRBs do not resemble a “Planck” function.
Rather, the (time integrated) spectra could be easily ﬁtted with a nearly featureless
broken power law spectra, which peaks at the sub MeV energy range. This became
known is as the “Band” function (after the late David Band;18–22).

The leading theoretical interpretation of this non-thermal spectra was, and still
is, synchrotron emission by relativistic electrons.23–30 This is a very common mech-
anism that is capable of explaining non-thermal emission in many diﬀerent astro-
nomical objects, from solar ﬂares to active galaxies. As such, it is well studied
since the 1960’s,31 and its basic theoretical framework appears in many textbooks
[e.g.,32]. Further support of this idea came from the fact that synchrotron emission
ﬁts very well GRB afterglow emission (at least during late times; see33 onward).
The synchrotron emission (presumably peaking at the sub MeV range to match the
prompt emission data) is expected to be accompanied by inverse-Compton scat-

tering at higher energies (synchrotron self-Compton; SSC). Alternative models sug-
gested that energetic protons may have a substantial contribution to the spectra via
proton-synchrotron emission or photo-pair production.28,34 The hadronic models,
though typically require the deposition of a very large amount of kinetic energy,
due to the much less eﬃcient emission from protons as compared to electrons.

Although the synchrotron emission model became widely accepted by the mid
1990’s, already in the late 1990’s evidence began to accumulate that the low energy
spectral slopes (below the sub MeV peak) observed in the vast majority of GRBs are
steeper than allowed by the synchrotron or synchrotron-SSC models.35–38 A second
diﬃculty is the inability of this model to explain the observed correlation between
peak energy and luminosity39,40 without invoking additional assumptions.41,42

From a theoretical perspective, the synchrotron model relies on the existence of
energetic particles and strong magnetic ﬁelds. Within the context of the internal
shock model, particles gain their energy following internal shocks that dissipate the
outﬂow kinetic energy. However, a well known problem is the very low eﬃciency
in energy conversion, typically no more than a few %.43–50 A second theoretical
problem that arises from ﬁtting the data is that the required values of the magnetic
ﬁeld needed to produce the sub MeV peak are close to equipartition, while ﬁts of
the afterglow show that the magnetic ﬁeld produces at shock fronts is typically
two orders of magnitude below equipartition, and in many cases less.33,51 A third
problem is the fact that the energy of the peak is very sensitive to the model
parameters (bulk Lorentz factor, Γ, electron’s temperature, θe and magnetic ﬁeld,
B): Epeak ∝ Γθ2
e B. Given the large diﬀerences among the various GRBs, it is
diﬃcult to explain the observed narrow clustering of the peak energy without ﬁne
tuning the model’s free parameters.

These observational and theoretical drawbacks of the purely non-thermal emis-
sion models have led to renewed interest in thermal models.52–57 A key diﬀerence
between these new thermal models and earlier models is the realization that a ther-
mal component is not the sole emission component, and is in most cases accompa-
nied by a non-thermal component. One diﬀerence between the diﬀerent theoretical
ideas is the relative strength of the thermal vs. non-thermal parts of the overall
non-thermal spectra. Within the framework of the basic “ﬁreball” model, such dif-
ferences are explained by the diﬀerent photospheric radii: during the coasting phase,
the photons suﬀer a substantial adiabatic losses, and both the temperature and the
thermal luminosity drop as ∝ r−2/3. As the photospheric radius is uncertain, weak
thermal signal can be explained as originating from large photospheric radius.

In many of these hybrid models, the observed sub-MeV peak was thought to
originate from the thermal component, while the non-thermal part acts to broaden
the “Planck” spectra. These assumptions enabled these models to overcome many
of the drawbacks of the pure thermal and pure non-thermal models. In particular:
(1) the existence of hard low energy spectral slopes; (2) temporal variations in
the spectral shape; (3) the observed spectral correlations between the peak energy
and luminosity; (4) the high eﬃciency (thermal photons originate directly from

March 17, 2016 0:28

4

the explosion, and as such no kinetic or magnetic energy dissipation is needed in
producing them); and (5) they naturally explain the existence of a complex spectral
shape.

Despite these successes, these models were, by large, heuristic in nature. For
example, the thermal and non-thermal parts were treated as a completely separate
entities. Another example is that temporal evolution was not treated in a quanti-
tative way. In fact, a major breakthrough took place when it was realized58,59 that
one needs to look at time-resolved spectra. As the emission mechanisms vary with
time, time-integrated spectra can easily smear out any signal. Clearly, this produces
a much larger technical challenge. In many GRBs (certainly in the BATSE era),
there were simply not enough photons observed to enable spectral analysis on short
times. Still, there were several bright GRBs for which such an analysis could be
done.

3. Observational status

A key point which is particularly confusing to many people, is the fact that one
needs to discriminate between direct and indirect evidence for the existence of a
thermal component. A direct evidence for a thermal component - namely, a direct
observation of black body, or grey body spectra in GRBs is relatively rare. Fur-
thermore, in most cases in which it is observed, it is accompanied by a non-thermal
part. Nonetheless, the fraction of GRBs in which a pure thermal component is
observed increases with (1) the GRB brightness; and (2) when time resolved spec-
troscopy is performed. These two facts strongly points towards the possibility that
in many bursts this component is simply smeared, due to the low number of photons
detected: nearly by deﬁnition, the ﬂux of most bursts observed is close to the detec-
tor’s limit, and thus only very few photons are observed for most GRBs reported.
Combined with the fact that both the thermal and non-thermal parts of the spectra
vary with time, it is clear why direct observation of thermal component is diﬃcult
and rare.

As opposed to this, indirect evidence for the existence of thermal component
exist in a very large fraction of bursts. These evidence are based mainly on ﬁtting
the low energy spectral slopes (below the peak energy) in “Band” model ﬁts. The
theory of synchrotron radiation provides a robust upper limit on the low energy
spectral slope that can be observed: Fν ∝ ν−α, with α ≥ 1/2 (in the “fast cool-
ing” regime).32,60,61 This upper limit, though, is lower than the spectral slopes
observed in the majority of GRBs.35–38 This result implies that the (simple ver-
sion) of the synchrotron model by itself cannot explain the spectra. This motivated
several authors to suggest modiﬁcations to the model, by altering one or more of
its underlying assumptions. Suggestions include addition of a spatial scale for the
decay of this ﬁeld,62–65 modify the acceleration process66,67 or substantial modiﬁ-
cation of the low energy particle distribution due to inverse-Compton scattering.68
When such modiﬁcations are made, much better ﬁts to the spectra can be made.69

March 17, 2016 0:28

Nonetheless, recent works suggested an even more robust way of testing the syn-
chrotron prediction, by looking at the spectral width of the entire spectrum (rather
than focusing on the low energy spectral slope). The results of these works,70,71 in
fact, suggest that a thermal emission component exists in nearly 100% of all GRBs.

3.1. Direct evidence

The most robust way of claiming the detection of a thermal component is by ﬁtting
the spectra - or part of the spectra, with a “Planck” (or modiﬁed Planck) function.
This provides a direct probe of (1) the thermal ﬂux, and (2) the temperature of the
thermal component. However, unfortunately, as is stated above, this is often not an
easy task.

There are two reasons for this diﬃculty, and both are related to the analysis
method. First, for most GRBs the spectral analysis is based on analyzing ﬂux in-
tegrated over the entire duration of the prompt emission, namely the spectra is
time-integrated. Clearly, this is a trade oﬀ, as enough photons need to be collected
in order to analyze the spectra. For weak bursts this is the only thing one can do.
However, obviously this inevitably leads to smearing of any time-dependent signal,
and produce artifacts.72

Second, the analysis is done by a forward folding method, which implies the
following: a model spectrum is convolved with the detector response, and compared
to the detected counts spectrum. The model parameters are varied in search for
the minimal diﬀerence between model and data; this gives the best ﬁtted model’s
parameters. However, this method implies that the outcome of the analysis are
biased by the initial hypothesis: as the ﬁtted results depend on the model that was
initially chosen, two diﬀerent models can provide equally good ﬁts to the
same data.

A particular source of diﬃculty is the wide-spread use of the “Band” model
in ﬁtting the prompt emission spectra. Having only 4 free parameters, ﬁtting the
data using this model is unable to capture any “wiggles” or “bumps” that may
exist in the spectra. But the existence of such wiggles are exactly the indicators
for a possible thermal component atop a non-thermal spectrum! In particular, a
composite spectra, in which a thermal component is only one ingredient would be
completely smeared. This is the key reason why study of a thermal component in
GRBs was delayed for over a decade.

In order to overcome both problems, a diﬀerent analysis method was suggested
by F. Ryde.58,59 Firstly, ﬁts to the prompt emission spectra were carried using
a “hybrid” model, that contains a thermal component (a “Planck” function) in
addition to a single power law (see Figure 1). The rational was to keep the number
of free parameters to four (same as in the “Band” model), for ease of comparison
of quality of ﬁts. On the downside, clearly a single power law cannot represent
any physical emission process; it can, though, be acceptable over a limited energy
range, as was available during the BATSE era. A second novelty was the use of time

resolved spectral analysis. While this limited the number of bursts in which the
analysis could be carried to only O(10), it enabled, for the ﬁrst time, the detection
of a temporal evolution of the properties of the thermal component (see Figure 2).
This analysis was extended by Ref. 73, to study the properties of 56 BATSE
GRBs, the largest sample at that date. That analysis revealed a clear repetitive
behavior in the properties of the thermal component, which were found to be dis-
tinctive from those of the non-thermal part. The temporal evolution of both the
temperature and thermal ﬂux show a well-deﬁned, broken power law behavior. The
temperature was found to be nearly constant at t ≤ tbrk ∼few s, and then de-
cayed as T (t) ∝ t−α, with hαi = 0.68. The thermal ﬂux ﬁrst rise as F (t) ∝ tβ
with hβi = 0.63, and after break time (which typically coincide with the break
time observed in the evolution of the temperature) it decays with an average index

is within the errors of the break time in the temperature evolution.

hβi = −2 (Figure 3). This repetitive temporal behavior serves as an independent
indicator for the existence of a distinct thermal component; for the least, a compo-
nent that is distinct from the non-thermal part of the spectrum in both its spectral
and temporal properties (see discussion on the theoretical interpretation below).

The launch of Fermi gamma-ray space telescope in 2008, enabled much broader
spectral range than was available prior to its launch. The increase in spectral range
made it clear that in many GRBs a simple 4 component “Band” function is insuﬃ-
cient to describe the broad band spectrum. Contrary to some initial expectations,74
it was found that in many GRBs the prompt spectra can only be ﬁtted with multi-
ple spectral components, that contain several “wiggles”. In some basic sense, this is
of no surprise, as the “ﬁreball” model was constructed to enable multiple emission
zones with diﬀerent physical conditions. There is thus no a-priori reason to believe
that all emission zones will produce identical spectra. This conclusion is further
strengthen by Fermi’s detection of a typical delay of few seconds in observations of
the high energy photons [e.g.,75–78].

Despite this progress, still in the Fermi era it is found that the “Band” function
provides reasonable ﬁts to the vast majority of GRBs.79–84 Many of these ﬁts diﬀer
than earlier ﬁts by the use of time-resolved analysis. Still, as explained above, in
these ﬁts “Band” model template was a-priori assumed, implying that “wiggles”
could not be detected. Thus, these ﬁts cannot exclude the possibility that thermal
component does exist, and could be revealed if more sophisticated templates were
in use. Furthermore, it is found that the deviations from the “Band” ﬁts are more
likely to occur in bright GRBs,85 emphasizing the important of suﬃcient photon
number statistics in drawing conclusions about GRB spectral properties. Nonethe-
less, these analyses imply that in most GRBs the observed spectrum is, by large,
non-thermal and the thermal component, if indeed exist, is not dominant - it is
always accompanied by a non-thermal part.

An exceptional burst was the very bright burst GRB090902B.75,86,87 Its spectra
showed an extremely bright thermal component, well distinct from the non-thermal
part (see Figure 4). The thermal component was so pronounced, that the spectra
rejected any attempt to be ﬁtted with a “Band” model, despite numerous eﬀorts.

ponent. Left: countes spectrum. Right: unfolded νFν spectrum. Figure adopted from Ref.75

Attempts to ﬁt only the thermal part with a “Band” model concluded that both the
low and high energy slopes are so steep that only a “Planck” spectrum could pro-
vide a physical origin to the ﬁt. Furthermore, being so bright, it was easy to follow
the temporal evolution of the prompt emission. After a few seconds, the thermal
component began to spread, resembling more and more a “standard” “Band” func-
tion.87

While GRB090902B was a single event, its appearance clearly demonstrated
the fact that multiple spectral components indeed exist in the prompt emission
spectra. Furthermore, their relative strength can vary during the prompt phase.
These ﬁndings encouraged several authors to abandon the “Band” ﬁts and search
for thermal emission, by modifying the a-priori assumed template. Indeed, once more
complicated templates began to be used, a thermal component (on top of a non-
thermal spectra) was found in several bursts. A few notable ones are GRB090510
[76], GRB090618[88,89], GRB110721A [90,91], GRB100724B [92], GRB100507 [93],
GRB120323A [94], GRB110920A [95], and GRB101219B [96].

Many of these ﬁts used an “advanced” version of Ryde’s original “hybrid” model,
by modeling the non-thermal part of the spectra with a “Band” function. This
implies that these models are semi-physical (the thermal part has clear physical
origin, while the origin of the “Band” function is unclear). A repeated result is
that, using these ﬁts, the thermal component often does not coincide with the
peak energy, but is observed as a lower energy “wiggle” on top of the “Band” low
energy spectral slope (see Figure 5). The observed thermal ﬂux is at the range of
tens of % of the total ﬂux. This result, though may be attributed to a selection

March 17, 2016 0:28

bias: if the fraction of thermal photons was lower than that, they could not have
been detected. Recetly, it was shown that the “Band” function in these ﬁts can be
associated with (slow cooled) synchrotron emission, at least in a few bursts97,98

Fig. 5. The spectra of GRB110721A is best ﬁt with a “Band” model (peaking at Epeak ∼ 1 MeV),
and a blackbody component (having temperature T ∼ 100 keV). The advantage over using just a
“Band” function is evident when looking at the residuals (Taken from91)

There are therefore two key conclusions from these works.

(1) The main conclusion is that thermal component is most likely ubiquitous. A
main reason why it is not observed in many bursts is simply that many ﬁts are
done using templates that don’t enable its discovery. A secondary reason is that
(by deﬁnition) most bursts will be seen with very low photon statistics, that
will not enable its detection.

(2) In most cases in which a thermal component was detected, it was accompanied
by a non-thermal part, which typically was seen to be with higher ﬂux. Fur-
thermore, for most bursts in which a thermal component is observed, the peak
of the thermal component does not coincide with the spectral peak. In several
cases, the observed peak of the “Band” spectrum is too energetic to be explain
by a thermal component.99

3.2. Thermal emission observed at late times

A few authors have reported a thermal component that was detected not in the
γ-rays, but rather in the X-ray band. In these bursts, the typical temperature of
the thermal component is at the ∼ keV range, as opposed to ∼ 100 keV observed
in the bursts discussed above. Furthermore, in these bursts the thermal component
was observed to last hundreds of seconds, extending well into the afterglow phase.

March 17, 2016 0:28

WSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in ms

10

In this category, there are both low luminosity GRBs such as GRB060218 [100,101]
or GRB100316D [102] but also many GRBs with typical luminosities, e.g.,88,103–109
Common to all GRBs in this category are (1) the fact that the thermal com-
ponent is observed well into the afterglow phase; and (2) the inferred values of the
Lorentz factors are at least an order of magnitude lower than that of “standard”
GRBs: Γ . few tens, and in some cases much lower, Γ & 1. These results indicate
that the physical origin of the thermal component in these bursts may be diﬀerent
than those bursts in which a thermal component is seen at higher energies. Lead-
ing models are supernovae shock breakout and emission from the emerging cocoon
(which we will brieﬂy discuss below). Overall, these detections imply that there is
more than a single way of producing a thermal component in GRBs.

3.3. Indirect evidence

As explained above, direct detection of a thermal emission (observation of a
“Planck” function) is still relatively rare. A major part of this is the use of the
“Band” ﬁtting function. A second reason is the lack of suﬃcient photon statis-
tics; and a third possible reason (which will be described below) is possible various
physical mechanisms that act to smear the pure “Planck” function. In fact, such
mechanisms, if indeed operate, will make it very diﬃcult to claim any detection of
the thermal component.

Nonetheless, there are ample of indirect evidence for the existence of a ther-
mal emission component in the vast majority of bursts. These evidence are based
on the fact that the “Band” ﬁt, by itself, does not contain any physical meaning.
Thus, it needs to be interpreted in the framework of one (or more) known radiative
mechanisms. Clearly, there is more than one way of interpreting the data. Nonethe-
less, some of the key observed properties cannot be explained in the framework of
any of the alternative radiative mechanisms, or that they require “ﬁne tuning” of
the model parameters. These same properties can, in some cases, be much easier
explained if one assumes that the observed spectrum is composed of a (modiﬁed)
Planck component.

Among the key observed properties, one ﬁnds the following:

(1) Steep low energy spectral slopes. As discussed above, when ﬁtting the
prompt spectrum with a “Band” function, the average low energy spectral slope
obtained is hαi = −1. The low energy spectral slope of about 85% of the GRBs
ﬁtted in this way are found to be steeper than −1.5, which is the upper limit al-
lowed by synchrotron emission (in the “fast cooling” regime).20,22,35–38,80,98,110
This result therefore implies that the (optically thin) synchrotron emission can-
not be responsible to this emission, at least without signiﬁcant modiﬁcations to
its underlying assumptions.

(2) Spectral width. Recent works measured the spectral width of the prompt
emission. The advantage of this method is that it is not sensitive to any as-
sumptions about the initial particle distribution (power law or not) or to the

March 17, 2016 0:28

11

question of fast vs. slow cooling. The results of these works [Ref.70,71] clearly
indicate that synchrotron emission - even from a Maxwellian distribution of
particles produces a much wider spectrum than is observed. We point out that
a full assessment of these results require direct ﬁts to the synchrotron model,
in order to overcome the ambiguity caused by the forward-folding technique.

(3) Observed correlations. Several correlations have been reported between the
peak energy and the total energy or luminosity of a GRB [e.g.,39,40,111,112].
Within the framework of the “synchrotron” model, the peak energy has a strong
dependence on the free model parameters, Epeak ∝ Γθ2
elB, where Γ is the bulk
Lorentz factor, B is the magnetic ﬁeld and θel is the characteristic electron’s
temperature. Thus, ﬁrst, there is no a-priori reason why the peak energy in all
GRBs should be roughly at the sub-MeV range; the values of all these three
parameters can vary substantially between the bursts. Furthermore, there is
no a-priori simple explanation to the observed peaks, without adding further
assumptions.41,42
Explaining the observed peak with a thermal emission also requires tuning of
the parameters [e.g.,53,56,113], though it seem to be less restrictive than in the
synchrotron model. Similarly, while thermal emission by itself cannot explain
any of the observed correlations, it can do so with a relatively minor modiﬁca-
tions [e.g.,114–117].

4. Theory

4.1. Existence of a thermal component

As discussed in section 2 above, a thermal emission component was expected from
the very early days following the realization that GRBs are cosmological. The huge
optical depth at the base of the ﬂow (τ ∼ 1015) implies that any existing radiation
will thermalize before escaping. Thus, a thermal component is an inherent part
of the cosmological “ﬁreball” model that was expected very early on.11–13 This
conclusion is not changed if the acceleration is mediated not by photons but by
reconnection of strong magnetic ﬁelds that may exist in the innermost regions of the
outﬂow.16,118–120 None of the early models, though provided any robust predictions
about the relative importance of the thermal vs. the non-thermal part. The expected
thermal to non-thermal ﬂux ratio depends on several unknown factors such as the
radius of the photosphere, the radii of the energy dissipation episodes that lead to
the emission of the non-thermal radiation, and the eﬃciency in producing the non-
thermal photons. As a result, a variety of models exist, in which the relative strength
of the thermal component vary - from dominant52,54 to sub-dominant.53,55,56

Lacking any clear theoretical prediction, the values of the unknown models pa-
rameters were deduced from observations. The lack of a clear thermal signal in the
observed data therefore led many people to consider a parameter space region in
which a thermal component is sub-dominant. This can be easily obtained if the pho-
tospheric radius, rph is large enough, so that the thermal photons suﬀer substantial

adiabatic losses prior to their escape. In such a scenario, it was concluded by many
authors that the origin of the observed peak energy at the sub-MeV range is most
likely due to synchrotron emission [for a very partial list, see Refs.15,23,25,26,121–127].
This line of reasoning was forced to be reconsidered once evidence began to accu-
mulate for the inconsistency of the observed spectra with the theoretical predictions
of the synchrotron model, in the early 2000’s.

Even in those versions of the GRB “ﬁreball” model in which only a small num-
ber of thermal photons is initially assumed, the theory allows the creation of a
large number of thermal photons at a later stage. These photons can be created
by friction between the jet components, or the jet component and the surround-
ing material. For example, free neutrons are expected to decouple the protons at
small radii, below the photosphere, due to the lower cross section for proton-neutron
collision relative to Thomson cross section. The friction between the neutrons and
protons can result in energy dissipation, that eventually heats the jet and is capa-
ble of producing a large number of thermal photons128,129 (provided, of course that
this energy dissipation occurs suﬃciently below the photosphere). It was further
proposed that these photons may be associated with the peak energy.130

The association of

long GRBs with core-collapse supernovae of

type
Ib/c100,102,131–135 led to the conclusion that at least long GRBs are associated with
the death of massive star. In this so-called “collapsar” model,136–142 the GRB jet
drills its way through the collapsing material.143,144 Interaction between the jet and
the stellar envelope will lead to the formation of shock waves which will heat the
plasma. These shock waves could potentially occur below the photosphere, thereby
providing another channel for producing thermal photons.145,146 A prediction of this
model is the association of the thermal (and non-thermal) emission time with the
time it takes the stellar material to collapse, which is of the order of ∼ 10 s.143,147–149
Once the jet completes its crossing through the stellar envelope, the external pres-
sure rapidly drops, and the radii of these recollimation shocks would gradually
increase until they would eventually disappear and the ﬂow becomes free. However,
this stage typically lasts a duration of a few sound crossing times, ≃ 10 s.147,148,150
During this epoch, these shocks are roughly at their initial location, thereby are
capable of producing a thermal emission component.

On its way out of the collapsing star, the jet heats and pushes the collapsing
stellar material, forming a hot “cocoon”, that expands outside of the stellar envelope
following the emergence of the jet. This hot cocoon, which is much slower than the
jet itself (estimates based on numerical models reveal Γc ∼ 10) is optically thick,
with optical depth that can reach few hundreds.151 It may therefore be responsible
for the late time thermal emission observed.152 Finally, additional source of thermal
emission may be the interaction of the relativistic GRB jet with the supernova
shell.153

Thus, to summarize this section, in fact there is a consensus that a thermal
emission component should exist in cosmological GRBs; this is agreed by many
diﬀerent models that consider diﬀerent dynamical scenarios. None of currently ex-

isting models, though, give any robust prediction on the expected strength of the
thermal component, and the models diﬀer in the relative importance of this com-
ponent. Lacking a clear theoretical prediction, in fact in nearly all models the role
of a thermal component is left as a free parameter that is scaled by observations.

4.2. Broadening of the thermal components

The fact that thermal emission was predicted to exist (and in some models predicted
to be dominant) in the GRB prompt spectra, naturally raise the question of its lack
or weakness in the observed spectra. One immediate answer for its lack is adiabatic
energy losses below the photosphere. As discussed above, these are expected in
parameter space region in which the photospheric radius is very large. In such a
case, the thermal photons loose their energy below the photosphere at the expense
of the plasma’s bulk kinetic energy. As a result, when the thermal photons decouple
the plasma at the photosphere, both their temperature and thermal ﬂux are low -
close to, or even below the detection limit. This view was the leading view up until
the ﬁrst half of the 2000’s, and is still a leading view by several scientists.

In this scenario the dominant emission processes responsible for the observed
signal therefore take place way above the photosphere. As such, they must be non-
thermal in nature: the leading mechanisms are synchrotron, inverse Compton or,
alternatively, emission from energetic hadrons. These processes follow episode(s) of
energy dissipation (either kinetic or magnetic), which accelerate particles that pro-
duce the non-thermal radiation. According to this picture, the thermal component
plays a very small or negligible role in shaping the observed spectra.

As explained above, this view was challenged in the early 2000’s by various
observations that were found to be in contradiction to the optically thin emission
model predictions. One branch of solutions was, and still is, to modify one or more
of the underlying assumptions of the optically thin models (see discussion in sec-
tion 3 above). An alternative approach is to look at mechanisms that may modify
the thermal component itself in such a way that the modiﬁed spectral shape will
resemble the observed one. If this line of reasoning is correct, the thermal emission
component in fact plays a very central role in determining the observed spectra.
The observed GRB spectra deviates from a “Planck” function (and thus seem as
being non-thermal) due to various physical processes and geometrical eﬀects.

In this section we discuss some possible mechanisms that can act to modify the
Planck spectra and their implications. Of course, if this is the correct scenario, it
is much more diﬃcult to prove the existence of an initial thermal component from
the observed signal.

4.2.1. Physical broadening and connection with the non-thermal spectra

The most natural way of modifying a “pure” thermal component is by assuming
that some part of the available energy (kinetic or magnetic) is dissipated below, or
close to the photosphere. In fact, this is a natural part of the classical “ﬁreball”

March 17, 2016 0:28

WSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in ms

14

model, in which the jet’s kinetic energy is dissipated by instabilities in the outﬂow
that lead to internal shock waves.154,155 As we pointed out above, the “ﬁreball”
model (in all its diﬀerent versions) does not provide strong constraints on the radii
of the internal collisions between the outﬂow components that dissipate its kinetic
energy. Part of these collisions may very well occur below the photosphere. Similarly,
in models in which the outﬂow is highly magnetized, it is often assumed that the
magnetic energy is dissipated at a constant rate from the fast magnetosonic radius
onward,118–120,156 implying that part of the energy is dissipated below (but close
to) the photosphere.

This dissipated energy is used (at least in part) to heat and/or accelerate plasma
particle (electrons and possibly protons). A leading mechanism by which this dis-
sipation can occur is by sub-photospheric (radiation-mediated) shock waves. The
microphysics of particle acceleration in shock waves is of yet an open question. It
was recently argued that sub-photospheric shock waves lack the the structure that
enable the acceleration of particles to high energies.157 This, however, is expected to
have only little eﬀect on the emerging spectra, with respect to a scenario in which
the particles are thermally heated by the shock waves. The reason is as follows. Once
the particles are heated or accelerated, they radiatively cool extremely rapidly by
upscattering the thermal photons. Due to the fact that below the photosphere the
number of thermal photons in the plasma is much greater than the number of parti-
cles, any energetic particle undergoes very many scattering, and therefore its cooling
time is many orders of magnitude shorter than the dynamical time.158 This means
that the energetic particles will form a (quasi-) steady state very rapidly, which
could be characterized by a (quasi-) Maxwellian distribution. Their temperature is
determined by balance between the heating (whose details depend on the unknown
details of the dissipation mechanism) on the one hand, and radiative cooling on the
other hand. As long as the external heating is active, the particle’s temperature will
inevitably be higher than the temperature of the thermal photons in the plasma,
that are not directly aﬀected by the heating process. The result is the formation
of a ’two temperature’ plasma, containing a population of thermal photons with
(comoving) temperature T ′
γ, and a population of hotter electrons, characterized by
a higher temperature, T ′

el > T ′
γ.

As was discussed in Ref.,158 the particle’s temperature is highly regulated, and is
very weakly depending on the model’s parameters. It depends on only two parame-
ters: (i) the ratio between heating rate and cooling rate (or, alternatively the energy
density in the particles and the thermal photons), and (ii) the optical depth in which
the dissipation takes place, which is governed by the radius of energy dissipation.
The optical depth determines the number of scattering. For optical depth at the
range 1 . τ . 100, the electron’s steady state (comoving) normalized temperature
is kT ′

el/mec2 ∼ 0.1 − 1.
The electron’s distribution settle to the quasi steady state on a time scale much
shorter then the dynamical time. Thus, during most of the dynamical time, the
hotter electrons up-scatter the thermal photons, forming a secondary distribution

at energies above T ′

γ.159–164 This is demonstrated in Figure 6, taken from Ref.159

The resulting spectral shape depends on the optical depth in which the dissipa-
tion takes place. This is most easily understood when looking at the two extremes.
If the radius at which the dissipation occurs is much greater than the photosphere
(τ ≪ 1), then the thermal photons will have very few interactions with the ener-
getic particles, and will be observed as an independent spectral component. Some
thermal photons would serve as seed photons for Compton scattering by the ener-
getic particles; the relative strength in the observed spectra would depend on the
Compton Y parameter. In such a scenario, the energetic particles (that may be
energized already below the photosphere; see165) will radiate non-thermal emission.
Two additional peaks may therefore be seen - due to synchrotron emission at lower
energies, and synchrotron self Compton (SSC) peak at higher energies.

At the other extreme, in which the dissipation occurs in a very small radius
(τ ≫ 1), the up-scattered photons will have ample of time to re-distribute their
energy, and a new thermal distribution would emerge; simply, the energy given to
the particles by the dissipation mechanism would be distributed among the particles
and photons. The resulting spectrum will be thermal. Interestingly, in order for this
to happen, it is enough that the dissipation takes place in region in which the optical
depth is greater than few hundreds (see Figure 6).

The most interesting signal is observed if the dissipation occurs at intermediate
values of the optical depth, τ ∼ few - few tens. The addition of hot particles below
the photosphere implies that some of the thermal photons will be up-scattered; but
since by assumption τ is not very high, full re-thermalization could not be achieved.
As explained above, since the number of photons is much greater than the number
of particles, each particle will undergo very many scattering, and so the particle’s
distribution will be quasi Maxwellian, as opposed to the photon distribution.

The initial thermal component is expected to somewhat weaken, as thermal
photons are up-scattered; though the thermal component will maintain its original
temperature. The main radiative process above the thermal peak will be inverse-
Compton scattering, by the quasi thermal electrons. It is not hard to show that
at the range Tγ < E < Tel, the emerging spectra is a power law in energy. For a
relatively large parameter space region, the resulting spectra will be ﬂat.159,166,167
Additional radiative mechanisms, such as synchrotron emission, may contribute to
the lower energy part of the spectrum (below the thermal peak). Thus, in this case,
one does not expect a continuation of the power law from above the thermal peak to
below it. This is consistent with the negative results found when a search for a single
power law extending both above and below the thermal peak were conducted.168,169
The results presented in Figure 6 are calculated for a single dissipation episode.
In explaining the complex GRB lightcurve, multiple such episodes (e.g., internal
collisions) are expected. Thus, in reality, a variety of observed spectra, which are
superposition of the diﬀerent spectra that are obtained by dissipation at diﬀerent
optical depth are expected.170

The key results of this model do not change if one considers highly magnetized

Fig. 6. Time averaged broad band spectra expected following kinetic energy dissipation at various
optical depths. For low optical depth, the two low energy bumps are due to synchrotron emission
and the original thermal component, and the high energy bumps are due to inverse Compton
phenomenon. At high optical depth, τ ≥ 100, a Wien peak is formed at ∼ 10 keV, and is blue-
shifted to the MeV range by the bulk Lorentz factor ≃ 100 expected in GRBs. In the intermediate
regime, 0.1 < τ < 100, a ﬂat energy spectrum above the thermal peak is obtained by multiple

plasma.162,166,167,171,172 A main diﬀerence between the highly magnetized models
and the radiative dominated ones is the assumption that the source of energy that
is used in heating the plasma is reconnection of magnetic ﬁeld lines. As opposed to
internal shock waves which are discrete in nature, the magnetic energy dissipation
is expected to occur in a more gradual way along the ﬂow. Thus, in this model,
gradual heating of the plasma particles is expected from below the photosphere to
above it. The resulting spectra is surprisingly similar to the one obtained in the
discrete dissipation case; see Figure 7, taken from Ref.167

The model of sub-photospheric energy dissipation thus have four very impor-
tant advantages. First, it enables to explain some of the key properties of the ob-
served spectra that cannot be explained in the framework of the optically thin,
non-thermal emission models.173,174 Equally important is the fact that the pre-
dicted spectra of this model are only weakly sensitive to many of the uncertainties,
such as the unknown outﬂow magnetization, etc. This was investigated numerically
by several authors for diﬀerent dynamical models,116,175–177 as well as magnetiza-
tion parameter.178 Third, by slight modiﬁcation of a single parameter - the optical
depth in which the dissipation (or most of it) takes place, the emerging spectra can
have very diﬀerent shapes (see Figures 8, 9, taken from179). The sub-photospheric

respectively. The high σ0 ﬂows are characterized broader spectra. The model predicts that bright
prompt optical and UV emission is accompanied by powerful ∼GeV emission. For bright optical
emission, the optical spectrum is expected to be hard. Figure taken from Ref.167

dissipation model therefore uniﬁes diﬀerent spectra that seem to be qualitatively
diﬀerent when ﬁtted with a “Band” model into one framework. It can further be
tested by comparing high energies spectral cutoﬀs.180 Finally, as the origin of most
of the photons is thermal, the eﬃciency problem in kinetic or magnetic energy con-
version discussed above is much less severe. Most of the radiated energy is already in
the form of thermal photons, and the dissipated energy acts to re-distribute them.
Due to these advantages, this model attracted a lot of attention in recent years
[e.g.,114,116,128,130,145,157,160,161,163,165,173,176,181–187].

4.2.2. Geometrical broadening

Even if sub-photospheric dissipation does not exist in GRB jets, still the observed
spectrum emerging from the photosphere is expected to somewhat deviate from a
pure “Planck” shape. The reason is the “limb darkening” eﬀect: the optical path of
photons emerging from oﬀ the line of sight is larger than the optical path of photons
emerging on-axis. As a result of that, photons that originate oﬀ-axis will be cooler
than photons originating on-axis. As an observer cannot discriminate between the
two photons, the integrated spectral shape will be a distorted “Planck” spectrum.
The limb darkening eﬀect is well known in astronomy. Furthermore, the under-
standing that it will play some role in shaping the observed GRB spectra is also
not new.11,189,190 However, full treatment of this eﬀect for relativistic outﬂows, as
occur in GRB, was carried out only recently.5,185,191–195

When considering spherical, relativistic explosion characterized by Γ ≫ 1, one
can show that the photospheric radius is a strong function of the angle to the line

(see Ref.191), where the proportionality constant is a function of the mass ejection

This angular dependence implies that oﬀ-axis photons are observed at lower en-
ergies than on-axis photons, due to two eﬀects. First, they suﬀer enhanced adiabatic

losses as they travel longer path below the photosphere; and second, their Doppler
boost is reduced relative to photons emitted on-axis. Combined together, these two
eﬀects lead to ﬂattening of the Rayleigh-Jeans (low energy) part of the thermal
spectrum.

An in-depth calculation of the expected spectra, reveals the fact that the “pho-
tospheric radius”, deﬁned as the surface of last scattering, is in fact ill-deﬁned. A
photospheric radius gives only a very crude approximation to the probability of
photons to escape the plasma (which is equal to e−1 at rph). In reality, photons
have ﬁnite probability of being scattered at every location in space where parti-
cles exist. This realization led to the concept of a “vague photosphere” (See Figure
10).5,128,191,194–197 In a spherical explosion scenario, the eﬀect of the vague pho-
tosphere on the observed spectral shape is not large; it somewhat modiﬁes the
Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectrum, that reads Fν ∝ ν3/2 (Ref.185,196). However,
this assumes an idealistic scenario of spherical explosion, with a smooth velocity
proﬁle. More realistic numerical models that consider outﬂow instabilities due to
the interaction of the jet with the stellar envelope reveal a much more pronounced
eﬀect.198,199 Furthermore, as will be shortly discussed below, for non-spherical ex-
plosion, the eﬀect of the “vague photosphere” on the observed spectrum becomes
dramatic.

Even for a spherical case, emission from the “vague photosphere” implies that
late time photons are more likely to originate from oﬀ-axis angles. This provides a
robust prediction for the late time asymptotic decay law (assuming that the central
engine is abruptly shut), of F (t) ∝ t−2 and T (t) ∝ t−2/3.185,191,192 This limit is
obtained for the “pure” spherical scenario.

While the exact geometry of GRB jets, namely Γ(r, θ, φ) are unknown, numerical
simulations of jets propagating through the stellar core (e.g., Ref.200) suggest a jet
proﬁle of the form Γ(θ) ∼ Γ0/(1 + (θ/θj)2p), at least for non-magnetized outﬂows.
Such a jet proﬁle thus assumes a constant Lorentz factor, Γ ∼ Γ0 for θ <∼ θj (the
“jet core”, or inner jet), and decaying Lorentz factor at larger angles, Γ(θ) ∝ θ−p
(outer jet, or jet sheath). As the Lorentz factor is Γ ∝ L/ ˙M , such a proﬁle can
result from excess of mass load close to the jet edge, by mass collected from the star
( ˙M = ˙M (θ)), or alternatively by angle dependent luminosity.

The eﬀect of angle-dependence mass loading,

˙M = ˙M (θ) on the observed pho-
tospheric signal is dramatic. While emission from the inner parts of the jet re-
sult in mild modiﬁcation to the black body spectrum, photons emitted from the
outer jet’s photosphere dominate the spectra at low energies (see Figure 11, taken
<∼ few), this leads to ﬂat low energy spec-
from Ref.197). For narrow jets (θjΓ0
tra, dN/dE ∝ E−1, which is independent on the viewing angle, and very weakly
dependent on the exact jet proﬁle. This result thus raises the possibility that the
low energy slopes are in fact part of the photospheric emission itself, even if the
observed power law is substantially diﬀerent than a Rayleigh-Jeans. Furthermore,
it raises the possibility that study of the low energy slopes can be used to infer the
jet geometry.

Fig. 10. The green line represent the (normalized) photospheric radius rph as a function of the
angle to the line of sight, θ, for spherical explosion (see equation 1). The red dots represent the
last scattering locations of photons ejected in the center of relativistic expanding “ﬁreball” (using
a Monte-Carlo simulation). The black lines show contours. Clearly, photons can undergo their
last scattering at a range of radii and angles, leading to the concept of “vague photosphere”. The
observed photospheric signal is therefore smeared both in time and energy. Figure taken from.191

A second aspect of this scenario is that the photospheric emission can be ob-
served to be highly polarized, with up to ≈ 40% polarization.201–203 While inverse-
Compton (IC) scattering produces highly polarized light, in spherical models the
polarization from diﬀerent viewing angles cancels. However, this cancellation is in-
complete in jet-like models observed oﬀ-axis. Clearly, for an oﬀ-axis observer the
observed ﬂux will be reduced; nonetheless, for a large parameter space region it is
still high enough to be detected, in which case it will be seen to be highly polar-
ized.201

A non-spherical jet geometry has a third unique aspect, which is photon energy
gain by Fermi-like process. Below the photosphere, photons are scattered back and
forth between the jet core and the sheath. Due to the diﬀerence in velocity in
between the diﬀerent regions, on the average the photons gain energy. This leads to
a high energy power law tail, extending above the thermal peak.197,204 Similar to
the low energy case, this eﬀect may potentially be used as a new probe in studying
the jet geometry [Lundman et. al., in prep.].

4.3. Implications of observations of a thermal component

A great advantage of the photospheric emission is its relative simplicity. By deﬁ-
nition, the photosphere is the inner most region from which electromagnetic signal

Fig. 11. Left. The expected (observed) spectrum from a relativistic, optically thick outﬂow. The
resulting spectra does not resemble the naively expected “Planck” spectrum. Separate integration

can reach the observer. Thus, the properties of the emission site are much more con-
strained, relative, e.g., to synchrotron emission (whose emission radius, magnetic
ﬁeld strength and particle distribution are not known).

This advantage enables the use of an observed thermal component as a probe to
some key parts of the underlying GRB physics. The GRB environment is compli-
cated, and characterized by several processes of energy transfer that are obscured.
Gravitational energy is converted to kinetic energy (jet launching); kinetic and pos-
sibly magnetic energy is dissipated; particles are heated; and radiation is emitted.
We can only probe the ﬁnal outcome - the observed spectra and its temporal evo-
lution, from which all the previous stages and their physical ingredients need to be
deduced.

The relative simplicity of the thermal emission is therefore of a great advantage,
as it enables us to deduce several properties of GRB physics that are very diﬃcult to
probe. There are four main properties that have been discussed so far in the litera-
ture. First, if thermal photons are indeed the seed photons for Compton scattering,
then by comparing the thermal part to the non-thermal part of the spectrum, one
can directly probe the temperature of the hot electrons, as well as the optical depth
in which these electrons were introduced into the plasma (which is where the en-
ergy dissipation took place). Thus, by ﬁtting the data, one can provide information
about the properties of the energy dissipation process. This had been discussed in
section 4.2.1 [see Ref.179].

Second, as discussed in section 4.2.2, low and high energy spectral slopes as
well as polarization measurements may be used to probe the geometry of GRB
jets, and possibly even the viewing angle. Nonetheless, the ability to obtain similar

22

spectral slopes by more than a single way implies that further theoretical work is
needed before ﬁrm conclusions could be drawn. Third, the properties of the thermal
emission could be used to infer the dynamics of the outﬂow; and fourth, it may
even be used to constrain the outﬂow magnetization. Here, we discuss these last
two probes. A word of caution: in order to perform these analyses one has to be
able to clearly identify the properties of the thermal component (temperature and
ﬂux). Thus, these analysis can only be performed if the thermal component is not
strongly distorted by sub-photospheric dissipation or geometrical eﬀects.

4.3.1. Probing outﬂow dynamics

In the framework of the “hot” ﬁreball model in which the magnetic ﬁeld is dy-
namically sub-dominant, the (1-d) photospheric radius is a function of only two
parameters: the luminosity (which can be measured once the distance is known)
and the Lorentz factor. The photospheric radius is related to the observed temper-
)1/4, where σ is Stefan’s constant, and the
ature and ﬂux via rph/Γ ∝ (F ob
extra factor of Γ−1 is due to light aberration. Since rph ∝ LΓ−3, measurements of
the temperature and ﬂux for bursts with known redshift enables an independent
measurement of the Lorentz factor at the photosphere, Γ, the photospheric radius,
rph, and the acceleration radius, r0.205 These, in turn, can be used to determine the
full dynamical properties of the outﬂow.

bb /σT ob4

A very interesting result is that by using this method, it is found that r0, the
>∼ 108 cm, nearly two orders of magnitude
size of the jet base (Γ(r0) = 1), is r0
above the gravitational radius of 10 M⊙ black hole86,205–207 (see Figure 12). While
in many works it is assumed that r0 is ≈ few gravitational radii, in fact there is no
evidence for that in the data; the shortest variability time scale observed in GRBs,
δt = r0/c >∼ 10 ms, with average value of ≈ 500 ms.208 These results are therefore
consistent with the results obtained by analyzing the thermal data.

The high value of r0 may be interpreted as an indication for recollimation
shocks that occur at this radius. These shocks originate from interactions be-
tween the outﬂow and the collapsing star, and are clearly seen in numerical simu-
lations.147,148,150,200,209,210 Thus, this result may serve as an indirect probe for the
collapsar scenario.

Furthermore, the values of the Lorentz factor found using this method are at the
range 102 . Γ . 103. These values are similar to those inferred by other methods.
The results obtained by analyzing the thermal component are aligned with recent
constraints found by Ref.,183 that showed that the conditions for full thermalization
takes place only if dissipation takes place at intermediate radii, ∼ 1010 cm, where
the outﬂow Lorentz factor is mild, Γ ∼ 10. Interestingly, similar results albeit with
somewhat lower values of the Lorentz factor, Γ ∼ 102 were found when analyzing
X-ray ﬂares in a similar method.211 Thus, overall, the results obtained point towards
a new understanding of the early phases of jet dynamics.

4.3.2. Probing outﬂow magnetization

One of the key open questions in the study of GRBs is the role played by the
magnetic ﬁelds. Within the framework of the original “ﬁreball” model,15,154 the
ﬂow accelerates to relativistic velocities by radiative pressure, and magnetic ﬁelds
are dynamically unimportant. They do, though, play an important role in extracting
the energy from the hot electrons that radiate via synchrotron mechanism.

In contrast to this picture, the leading mechanism for accelerating jets in ac-
tive galactic nuclei (AGNs) is the Blandford-Znajek process,212 which involves
strong magnetic ﬁelds. It was therefore suggested that magnetic ﬁelds may be en-
ergetically dominated, hence play a central role in determining the dynamics of
GRB as well.118–120,156 This scenario could be valid if the progenitor of GRBs
are rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized neutron star - the so called “magne-
tars”.16,213–217,217–219 In this case, the main source of energy available for heating
the particles is reconnection of the magnetic ﬁeld lines,16,118–120 possibly enhanced
by turbulentic outﬂows.220

There are several diﬀerences between magnetically dominated outﬂow and bary-
onic dominated outﬂows. One such diﬀerence is the location of the photospheric
radius, which has a somewhat diﬀerent dependence on the free model parameters.
A second diﬀerence is the fact that the strong magnetic ﬁelds serve as “energy
reservoir”, dissipating their energy gradually. This implies that the ﬂux of the ther-
mal photons is weaker in magnetized models in comparison with baryon-dominated
ones. Based on this realization, it was argued that a weak - or lack thereof of a
thermal component could be attributed to a strong outﬂow magnetization.41,54,221
This argument was used by Ref.221 to claim that the outﬂow in GRB080916, which
did not show any clear evidence for the existence of a thermal component, could be
highly magnetized, with σ ≥ 20 (see Figure 13). This model further predicts high

polarization.222

Furthermore, strong magnetic ﬁeld would lead to rapid radiative cooling of the
energetic particles. This puts strong constraints on the properties of the particle
acceleration mechanism that could reproduce the observed signal.172 In a recent
work,223 it was shown that in the framework of continuous magnetic reconnection
model, conditions for full thermalization do not exist in the entire region below the
photosphere. As a result, the produced photons are up-scattered, and the resulting
peak of the Wien distribution formed is at >∼ 10 MeV. This again leads to the
same conclusion as drawn above, namely that identiﬁcation of thermal component
at energies of <∼ 100 keV must imply that the outﬂow cannot be highly magnetized.

5. Summary

A major breakthrough in our understanding of GRB prompt emission occurred in
recent years, with the realization that a thermal emission component exists on top
of the over all non-thermal spectra. This realization opens up a completely new
window into studying the physics of GRBs. In this short review, we highlighted
some of the major aspects of this realization.

In section 2 we pointed out to the fact that thermal emission was predicted
already by the very early models of cosmological GRBs. It was later abandoned,
as the observed spectra did not reveal a clear evidence of a “Planck” spectrum.

March 17, 2016 0:28

25

However, it was re-considered in the early 2000’s, following the realization that
known non-thermal models suﬀer diﬃculties in ﬁtting the observed data.

In section 3, we described the observational status. There are several key results

that need to be emphasized.

(1) The “Band” function provides good ﬁts to most of GRB data, with only a
relatively small fraction of GRBs that are of an exception. Nonetheless, the use
of “Band” ﬁts is highly misleading, as the “Band” model, from its very nature,
is not capable of capturing any “wiggles” that may indicate the existence of a
thermal emission. Furthermore, by deﬁnition, most bursts are detected close to
the detection limit, in which case a weak thermal signal could not be observed.
(2) The fraction of GRBs in which a thermal component is detected increases with
their observed luminosity. In most cases in which a thermal component was
detected, it was accompanied by a non-thermal emission. Furthermore, attempts
to associate a sole non-thermal radiative mechanism to the observed spectra
show inconsistency. These facts suggest that a thermal component is in fact
very ubiquitous among GRBs.

(3) In all cases in which a thermal component was detected, both the temperature
and thermal ﬂux show well deﬁned, repetitive temporal behavior, which is dis-
tinct from the non-thermal behavior. Although a theory that can explain this
behavior is of yet incomplete, the repetitive behavior strengthen the interpre-
tation of this component to be distinct.

(4) As a consequence, in order to make further progress, the logical step is to
abandon the “Band” ﬁts, and ﬁt the data with physically-motivated models,
that would include a thermal component, in addition to non-thermal emission
processes. Several such models already exist, though they are still not in wide
use. We can anticipate that with a more wider use, the existence of a thermal
emission would become more and more clear.

Section 4 was devoted to an overview of the theoretical status. We pointed out
that all leading theoretical models predict the existence of a thermal component,
though no existing theory provides robust predictions about its strength. We then
discussed various mechanisms that act to broaden the naively expected “Planck”
function. As we showed, the “Planck” function may be so heavily distorted, that
the resulting spectra would resemble the observed one. If this is indeed the case,
then the thermal component plays a very central role in the entire observed prompt
emission. In particular, we discussed the following points:

(1) Sub-photospheric energy dissipation is expected by many theoretical models. If
the dissipation occurs not too-far below the photosphere, a “two temperature”
plasma emerges. In this case, there is a complicated connection between the
thermal and non-thermal parts of the spectrum, as the thermal photons serve
as seed photons for scattering by the hotter electrons. In this scenario, the
leading radiative process above the thermal peak is IC scattering, rather than

26

synchrotron.

(2) Relativistic “limb darkening” eﬀect will further broaden the “Planck” spectra,
irrespective of any energy dissipation that may or may not exist. Study of this
eﬀect lead to the realization that the photosphere is, in fact “vague”. While
this results in only a minor modiﬁcation in the spherical explosion case, it
has a dramatic eﬀect on the observed spectra if the outﬂow is not spherical.
In this later case, photons can be accelerated by Fermi-like process below the
photosphere.

(3) If the thermal emission is not strongly distorted, its properties can be used
as a direct probe of the dynamics of the outﬂow. In particular, it can provide
an indirect evidence for the “collapsar” model. If the outﬂow is highly magne-
tized, the thermal component is expected to weaken. Therefore, weak, or lack
of thermal component can be used to constrain the outﬂow magnetization.

Nearly all of the realizations described here- both observational and theoretical
- occurred only in the last decade or so. Thus, while a major progress had been
made in recent years, clearly there are still several very important open questions in
the study of GRBs. These include, e.g., the questions of progenitor, magnetization
and energy dissipation.

It is diﬃcult to state at this point the role that thermal emission will play in
the future in resolving these issues. A main concern is the fact that the observed
signal is often degenerated, namely it can be explained by more than one model. A
good example is the fact that a weak “Planck” component can result from either
(1) adiabatic losses; (2) strong distortion due to sub-photospheric dissipation; or
(3) strong magnetization. Each of these models is very diﬀerent in nature than the
other ones. Thus, one needs to combine the thermal signal with additional clues
- both observational (broad-band non-thermal signal, temporal evolution) as well
as theoretical models, in order to achieve a comprehensive understanding of GRB
physics. Nonetheless, we believe that it is clear that the study of a thermal compo-
nent will continue to provide new probes that will eventually lead to answering the
open questions.
