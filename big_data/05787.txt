POWER SUMS OVER FINITE COMMUTATIVE UNITAL RINGS

JOS´E MAR´IA GRAU AND ANTONIO M. OLLER-MARC´EN

Abstract. In this paper we compute the sum of the k-th powers over any
ﬁnite commutative unital rings, thus generalizing known results for ﬁnite ﬁelds,
the rings of integers modulo n or the ring of Gaussian integers modulo n. As
an application we focus on quotient rings of the form Z/nZ[x]/(f (x)) for any
polynomial f ∈ Z[x].

1. Introduction

For a ﬁnite ring R and k ≥ 1, we deﬁne the power sum

Sk(R) := Xr∈R

rk.

Throughout the paper we will deal only with ﬁnite commutative unital rings and
our main objective will be the computation of Sk(R) in such case.

The problem of computing Sk(R) is completely solved only for some particular
families of ﬁnite rings. If R is a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq, the value of Sk(Fq) is well-known. If
R = Z/nZ, the study of Sk(Z/nZ) dates back to 1840 [10] and has been completed
in various works [2, 6, 9]. More recently, the case R = Z/nZ[i] has been solved in
[3]. In these cases, we have the following results.
Proposition 1. Let k ≥ 1 be an integer.
Sk(Fq) =(−1,

otherwise.

ii) Integers modulo n:

otherwise.

and p || n means that p | n, but p2 ∤ n.

On the other hand, there are not many works dealing with the non-commutative
case. The case of square matrices over ﬁnite ﬁelds is studied in [1], where the
following result is proved.

Proposition 2. Let k, d ≥ 1 be integers. Then Sk(Md(Fq)) = 0 unless q = 2 = d
and 1 < k ≡ −1, 0, 1 (mod 6) in which case Sk(Md(Fq)) = I2.

In [4] some general results for Sk(Md(Z/nZ)) are proved and the following con-

jecture is made about power sums of matrix rings over ﬁnite commutative rings.

Conjecture 1. Let d > 1 and let R be a ﬁnite commutative ring. Then, Sk(Md(R)) =
0 unless the following conditions hold:

i) d = 2,
ii) |R| ≡ 2 (mod 4) and 1 < k ≡ −1, 0, 1 (mod 6),
iii) The unique element e ∈ R \ {0} such that 2e = 0 is idempotent.

Moreover, in this case

Sk(Md(R)) =(cid:18)e

0

0

e(cid:19) .

In this paper, we completely solve the problem of computing Sk(R) for any ﬁnite
commutative unital ring. To do so, we ﬁrst recall some well-known ring-theoretic
facts. If R is a ﬁnite commutative unital ring with char(R) = n = pt1
l , then
we have a decomposition of R as a direct product of rings

1 ··· ptl

(1)

R ∼= R1 × ··· × Rl,

where char(Ri) = pti
a Z/pti

i . Moreover, for every i ∈ {1, . . . , l}, the ring Ri can be seen as
i Z-module and hence it can be decomposed as a direct sum of cyclic modules

(2)

Ri ∼= Ri,1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ Ri,mi ,

with ann(Ri,j ) = (ptj

i ) and 1 ≤ tj ≤ ti.

2. The prime-power characteristic case

Decomposition (1) above implies that, in order to get a general result, we can
restrict ourselves to the prime-power characteristic case. Hence, throughout this
section R will be a ﬁnite commutative unital ring with char(R) = pt.

Due to decomposition (2), R is the direct sum of cyclic modules. If R is itself a
cyclic Z/ptZ-module, then R ∼= Z/ptZ and Proposition 1 ii) applies to obtain that
Sk(R) = −pt−1 if p − 1 | k and Sk(R) = 0 otherwise. Thus, we will focus on the
non-cyclic case.
First of all, we will prove that if t > 1; i.e., if the characteristic is a prime-power

but not a prime then Sk(R) = 0.

Proposition 3. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative unital ring such that char(R) = pt
with t > 1. If R is not a cyclic Z/ptZ-module, then Sk(R) = 0 for every k ≥ 1.
Proof. Due to decomposition (2) we have that R ∼= R1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ Rm with m ≥ 2, Ri
cyclic and ann(Ri) = (pti ) with 1 ≤ ti ≤ t.

Hence, if we denote by xi a generator of Ri, then every element of R can be
uniquely written in the form a1x1 + ··· + amxm with ai ∈ {0, . . . , pti − 1} for every
i ∈ {1, . . . , m}. Thus,

Sk(R) =

(a1x1 +··· + amxm)k =

Xai=0

k

Xs=0

pti −1

Xai=0 (cid:18)k

s(cid:19)(a1x1)s(a2x2 +··· + amxm)k−s

and we will proceed inductively.

First of all, assume that m = 2. In this case,

Sk(R) =

Xs=0(cid:18)k

and note that either t1 ≥ 2 or t2 ≥ 2, for if t1, t2 < 2 then t = 1 which is not
possible.

For every s ∈ {0, . . . , k}, denote by A(s) :=

since ptixi = 0 we have that
pt1 −1

pt2 −1

Xa1=0

Xa2=0

pt2 −1

(a1x1)s(a2x2)k−s. Now,

On the other hand, if 0 < s < k,

A(s) =

(a2x2)k−s

and due to Proposition 1 ii) we have that

pt2 −1

Xa2=0

also that

(a2x2)k−s is either 0 or −pt2−1xk−s

. Consequently, it follows that

either A(s) = 0 or A(s) = pt1+t2−2xs
or t2 ≥ 2, it also follows that A(s) = 0 as claimed.

Now, if m > 2,

and for every 0 ≤ s ≤ k at least one of the summatories appearing in the latter
expression is 0 by induction hypothesis.

(cid:3)

The following series of technical lemmata will be useful when we consider the

case t = 1 in the sequel. In what follows Fq will denote the ﬁeld with q elements.

Lemma 1. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative unital Fq-algebra with q > 2 such that
there exists x ∈ R − {0} with x2 = 0. Then, Sk(R) = 0 for every k.

4

JOS ´E MAR´IA GRAU AND ANTONIO M. OLLER-MARC´EN

Proof. Given x ∈ R − {0} with x2 = 0 we can decompose R as the direct sum of
vector subspaces R =< x > ⊕R. Thus,

ktk−1x = 0,

aXt∈R

(tk + ktk−1ax) =

Sk(R) = Xa∈FqXt∈R
= qXt∈R

(ax + t)k = Xa∈FqXt∈R
tk + Xa∈Fq
because, for q > 2, it holds that Xa∈Fq
Lemma 2. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative unital Fq-algebra such that there exist a
free family {x, y} with xy = 0. Then, Sk(R) = 0 for every k.
Proof. Given a free family {x, y} with xy = 0 we can decompose R as the direct
sum of vector subspaces R =< x > ⊕ < y > ⊕R. Thus,
Sk(R) = Xa∈Fq Xb∈FqXt∈R

a = 0 due to Proposition 1 i).

(ax + by + t)k =

k

Xs=1(cid:18)k

s(cid:19)bsystk−s = 0

as claimed.
Lemma 3. Let R ∼= (Z/2Z)[x]/(x2) and let u be the only non-zero idempotent of
R. Then, Sk(R) = u if k > 1 is odd and Sk(R) = 0 otherwise.
Proof. In this situation, R = {0, 1, u, 1 + u} and since char(R) = 2, we have that

(cid:3)

Sk(R) = 0k + 1k + uk + (1 + u)k = ku

and the result follows.

(cid:3)

Now, we are in the conditions to prove the main result of this section.

Theorem 1. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative unital ring of prime-power character-
istic. Then, Sk(R) 6= 0 if and only if one of the following conditions hold.

i) |R| − 1 | k and R is a ﬁeld.
ii) R ∼= Z/psZ and p − 1 | k.
iii) R ∼= (Z/2Z)[x]/(x2) and k > 1 is odd.

Proof. If condition i) holds, then Sk(R) 6= 0 due to Proposition 1 i). If condition
If condition iii) holds, then
ii) holds, then Sk(R) 6= 0 due to Proposition 1 ii).
Sk(R) 6= 0 due to Lemma 3.
Conversely, assume that Sk(R) 6= 0. Proposition 3 implies that R must be cyclic
or it must have prime characteristic.
If it is cyclic, then Proposition 1 i) or ii)
applies (depending on wether R is a ﬁeld or not) and condition i) or ii) holds,
respectively. If R is not cyclic and has prime characteristic, Lemma 2 implies that
R cannot contain two diﬀerent zero-divisors. Consequently, not being a ﬁeld, R
must contain idempotents but in this case Lemma 1 implies that char(R) = 2. But

all the previous restrictions lead to R ∼= (Z/2Z)[x]/(x2) so Lemma 3 applies and
the result follows.

(cid:3)

As a consequence, we obtain the following corollary that gives a characterization
of ﬁnite ﬁelds in terms of power sums. The proof is straightforward and we omit.

Corollary 1. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative unital ring such that |R| is a prime-
power. Then, the following are equivalent.

i) R is a ﬁeld.
ii) Sk(R) = 0 or Sk(R) = −1 for every k ≥ 1.
iii) Sk(R) = −1 for k = |R| − 1.
iv) There exists k ≥ 1 such that Sk(R) = −1.

Remark. Corollary 1 provides an elementary (although ineﬃcient) algorithm to
determine if a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients is irreducible over Z/pZ. Its com-
putational complexity is exponential, thus it is worse than the fast already known
algorithms for the factorization of polynomials [8]. Moreover, it also determines if
an ideal in Z/pZ[x1, . . . , xm] is maximal.

For instance, let us consider I = (1 + x2 + y2,−1 − x + y2) ⊳ Z/3Z[x, y]. We will

prove that this ideal is maximal. To do so, we compute the sum

(a + bx + cy + dxy)80,

X0<=a,b,c,d<3

doing repeatedly the substitutions xn → xn−2(2 + 2y2) and yn → yn−2(1 + x) when
necessary until we arrive to an expression of the form A + Bx + Cy + Dxy. The
ideal I is maximal if and only if A ≡ 2 (mod 3) and B ≡ C ≡ D ≡ 0 (mod 3),
which is the case.

3. The general case

In the previous section we have focused on the case when the characteristic of
the ring is a prime-power. Now, we will focus on the general case. Let R be a
ﬁnite commutative unital ring and assume that |R| = ps1
l . This implies that
char(R) = pt1
l with 1 ≤ ti ≤ si for every i. Note that ti = si if and only if
Ri isomorphic to Z/psi
i R for every
i and, moreover, R ∼= R1 × ··· × Rl is
i ∈ {1, . . . , l}. Note that char(Ri) = pti
precisely the decomposition given in (1).

i . In this situation, we deﬁne rings Ri = R/pti

1 ··· psl

1 ··· ptl

In this setting, given k ≥ 1, let us deﬁne the sets
i − 1 | k},

Pk(R) := {pi : Ri is a ﬁeld and psi
P k(R) := {pi : Ri is isomorphic to Z/psi

i Z with si > 1 and pi − 1 | k}.

The following lemma is straightforward.

Lemma 4. Let R1 and R2 be ﬁnite commutative unital ring and let R = R1 × R2
be its direct sum. Then,

Sk(R) = (|R2|Sk(R1),|R1|Sk(R2)).

Now, we are in the condition to prove the main result of the paper.
Theorem 2. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative unital ring with |R| = ps1
let k ≥ 1 be an integer. Then, with the previous notation

precisely the previous ones.

Given a ﬁnite commutative unital ring R, let i : Z −→ R be the unique ring
homomorphism deﬁned by i(1) = 1. The previous result clearly implies that the
power sum Sk(R) is an element of Im(i) unless R ∼= Z/2Z[x]/(x2) × S with k > 1
odd and |S| odd.
Corollary 2. If k > 1 is odd and R contains a unique non-zero nilpotent element
u such that 2u = 0, then Sk(R) = u. Otherwise, Sk(R) ∈ i(Z).

Now, we characterize those ﬁnite commutative unital rings such that the power

sum Sk(R) is a unit.
Corollary 3. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative unital ring and let k ≥ 1 be an integer.
Then, Sk(R) is a unit if and only if the following conditions hold:
i) There exist ﬁelds F1, . . . , Fl such that R ∼= F1 × ··· × Fl.
ii) char(Fi) 6= char(Fj) for every i 6= j.
iii) (|Fi| − 1) | k for every 1 ≤ i ≤ l.

Proof. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative unital ring. We know that R ∼= R1 ×···× Rl
with Ri rings with coprime prime-power characteristic. Due to Lemma 4 it is clear
that Sk(R) is a unit in R if and only if Sk(Ri) is a unit in Ri for every i. But by
Theorem 1 and Proposition 1, this happens if and only if conditions i), ii) and iii)
hold.
(cid:3)

problem of determining the integers n for which

From the previous results the question of determining those ﬁnite commutative
unital rings R such that S|R|(R) = 1 naturally arises. This question generalizes the
in ≡ 1 (mod n). This latter
problem was solved in [7, Proposition 1] where it was proved that 1, 2, 6, 42 and
1806 are the only possibilities.

Corollary 4. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative unital ring such that |R| is square-free
and S|R|(R) = 1. Then, R is isomoprhic to one of the following rings: the Zero

In addition to the aforementioned rings, there is only one more ﬁnite commuta-

tive unital ring R with order smaller than 107 satisfying S|R|(R) = 1. Namely,

F16 × F9 × F5.

There are not many rings R with S|R|(R) = −1 either. The following result,
whose proof is identical to that of Theorem 3 (and hence we omit) characterizes
them.
Theorem 4. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative unital ring. Then, S|R|(R) = −1 if

iii) |R| ≡ psi (mod psi+1) for every 1 ≤ i ≤ l.
We have only been able to ﬁnd 5 rings with this property: the Zero Ring, F2,
F4 × F3, F16 × F81 × F25, F16 × F81 × F5 × F11. The orders of the non-zero cases
are: 2, 12, 32400 and 71280.

4. Power sums over Z/nZ[x]/(f (x))

As an application of the previous results, we are interested in computing the
power sum Sk(Z/nZ[x]/(f (x))), where f (x) is a monic polynomial. When deg f =
1, the result is straightforward because Z/nZ[x]/(f (x)) ∼= Z/nZ and Proposition 1
ii) applies.

In order to study the case when deg f > 1 we will ﬁrst focus on the quadratic

case.

4.1. Power sums over Z/nZ[x]/(x2 + bx + c).

Before we proceed, let us introduce some notation. Given any positive integer n

and integers b, c we deﬁne

Rb,c

n := Z/nZ[x]/(x2 + bx + c).

As usual, to compute the value of Sk(Rb,c

If s = 1, b is odd and c is even, then Rb,c

0 = x2 + x = x(x + 1), we can apply Lemma 2 to obtain that Sk(Rb,c

Finally, if both b and c are odd, then Rb,c

2s = Z/2Z/(x2 + x + 1) ∼= F4
because x2 + x + 1 is irreducible. Hence, we apply Proposition 1 i) to obtain
that Sk(Rb,c

If s = 1, observe that x2 + bx + c is reducible if and only if b2 − 4c is a
quadratic residue modulo p. Now, if x2 + bx + c is reducible we can apply
Lemma 1 or Lemma 2 to obtain that Sk(Rb,c
ps ) = 0 for every k. Finally, if
ps ∼= Fp2 and Proposition 1 i) ends the
x2 + bx + c is irreducible then Rb,c
proof.

With this proposition, we can prove the general result.

Theorem 5. Let n be any positive integer. Given integers k ≥ 1, b and c we deﬁne
the following set:

P b,c(k, n) := {prime p : p || n, p2−1 | k, b2−4c is not a quadratic residue modulo p}.

Proof. Observe that for coprime n1 and n2 we have that Rb,c
it suﬃces to apply Proposition 4 above.

As an interesting consequence of this result, we can compute the power sum over

the rings Z/nZ[√D] for a square-free integer D.

Corollary 5. Let k, n ≥ 1 be integers and let D be an square-free integer. Consider
the set

Proof. Just take f (x) = x2 − D and apply Theorem 5.
Remark. If we consider the case D = −1, the previous corollary immediately gives
Proposition 1 iii), which was proved in [3] using diﬀerent, more direct, techniques.

4.2. Power sums over Z/nZ[x]/(f (x)) with deg f > 2.

Now, we focus on the case when the degree of the considered polynomial is
greater than 2. The involved ideas are quite similar to those previously used. We
introduce the following notation:
Rf

n := Z/nZ[x]/(f (x)).

Theorem 6. Let f (x) be monic polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that
deg f > 2 and let k, n ≥ 1 be integers. Consider the set

P f (k, n) := {prime p : p || n, pdeg f − 1 | k, f (x) is irreducible modulo n}.

Then,

5. Future perspectives

5.1. Power sums over non-commutative rings. A natural sequel for this work
would be to focus on the computation of Sk(R) for more general rings. In particular,
the non-commutative case seems interesting and we can pose the following question.

Question 1. Is there any ﬁnite non-commutative ring R with odd characteristic
such that Sk(R) 6= 0 for some k?

This question is nontrivial and it is enough to restric it to prime characteristic
rings. Moreover, we have a lower bound for the cardinality of a candidate to answer
Question 1 in the aﬃrmative.

Proposition 5. Let R be a ﬁnite non-commutative unital ring with odd character-
istic. If Sk(R) 6= 0 for some k ≥ 1, then |R| ≥ 81.
Proof. A ﬁnite non-commutative unital ring with prime-power characteristic must
have cardinality ps for some prime p and s > 2. Thus, |R| = ps con s > 2. Now, if
|R| = p3 we have that

R ∼= Z/pZ < 1, x, y > /(x2 = 0, y2 = 0, xy = x, yx = 0)

because, up to isomorphism, there exists just one ﬁnite non-commutative unital
ring with p3 elements. Since, in this case it is easy to see that Sk(R) = 0 the result
follows.

5.2. Finite commutative unital rings such that S|R|(R) = ±1. At the end of
Section 3, we have given the characterizations of ﬁnite commutative unital rings
satisfying S|R|(R) = ±1. Those characterizations allowed us to ﬁnd, by computa-
tional means, rings with these properties. Hence, it arises the question of ﬁnding
some strategies to search for these rings and even to ﬁnd out if there is a ﬁnite
number of them (as in the case of square-free |R|)

5.3. Rings such that S|R|−1(R) = −1. Generalized Giuga’s conjecture. If R
is a ﬁeld S|R|−1(R) = −1. The converse is true (see Corollary 1) if we restric to rings
with prime-power characteristic. This immediately suggests the question about the
existence of a ring R which is not a ﬁeld and satisfying that S|R|−1(R) = −1. The
following result gives a characterization of such a ring.
Theorem 7. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative unital ring. Then, S|R|−1(R) = −1 if
and only if the following conditions hold:

s1

1 × ··· × Fp

sl
l

with pi 6= pj for every i 6= j.

i − 1 | |R| − 1 for every 1 ≤ i ≤ l.

i) R ∼= Fp
ii) psi
iii) |R| ≡ psi (mod psi+1) for every 1 ≤ i ≤ l.
Condition ii) is satisﬁed by many integers (by Carmichael numbers, for instance).
Nevertheless, we have not been able to ﬁnd among them any integer satisfying also
condition iii). This question is closely related to Giuga’s conjecture [5] that states
that there are no square-free compound integers satisfying conditions ii) and iii)
in−1 ≡ −1 (mod n) if
and only if n is prime. Hence, we propose the following generalization of Giuga’s
conjecture.

above. In other words, Giuga’s conjecture states that

Conjecture 2. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative unital ring. Then Xr∈R
