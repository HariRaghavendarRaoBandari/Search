ABSTRACT

The halo shape plays a central role in determining important observational proper-
ties of the halos such as mass, concentration and lensing cross sections. The triaxiality
of lensing galaxy clusters has a substantial impact on the distribution of the largest
Einstein radii, while weak lensing techniques are sensitive to the intrinsic halo elliptic-
ity. In this work, we provide scaling relations for the shapes of dark matter halos as a
function of mass (peak height) and redshift over more than four orders of magnitude in
halo masses, namely from 1011.5h−1M(cid:12) to 1015.8h−1M(cid:12). We have analysed four dark
matter only simulations from the MultiDark cosmological simulation suite with more
than 56 billion particles within boxes of 4.0, 2.5, 1.0 and 0.4 h−1Gpc size assuming
Planck cosmology. The dark matter halos have been identiﬁed in the simulations using
the RockStar halo ﬁnder, which also determines the axis ratios in terms of the diag-
onalisation of the inertia tensor. The minor-to-major and intermediate-to-major axis
ratios are well described by simple functional forms. We provide the corresponding
ﬁtting functions in order to infer the axis ratios for an hypothetical halo of a given
mass at a given redshift.

1 INTRODUCTION

According to the current paradigm of structure formation
isolated galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies are hosted
by dark matter halos of increasing mass. Quantum ﬂuctu-
ations generated during an early, inﬂationary epoch of the
Universe become classical density ﬂuctuations: the seed of
today’s observed large scale structures. In an expanding Uni-
verse dominated by weakly interacting dark matter, these
ﬂuctuations grow with time due to the gravitational insta-
bility which leads to the formation of self-gravitating dark
matter halos. The ﬁrst halos emerge from small scale ﬂuctu-
ations and progressively merge to form later generations of
more massive halos, where groups and clusters of galaxies are
hosted. These halos can be associated with the peaks in the
primordial Gaussian density ﬁeld of dark matter, and their
mass distributions can be derived in terms of the statistics
of Gaussian random ﬁelds and the spherical collapse model
of halo formation (Press & Schechter 1974).

Contrary to the model assumption the mass accretion
onto halos comes along a preferential direction (mostly along
a ﬁlament) and tends to be clumpy, i.e. massive halos form
by merging with smaller halos. For these reasons, one should
not expect that dark matter halos show a spherical shape
if their relaxation times are longer than the time between
mergers or their accretion events occur from a preferred di-
rection. For the most massive halos which host clusters of
galaxies, this can be directly observed. In fact, the non-
circular projection of optical and density maps (Carter &
Metcalfe 1980; Binggeli 1982), X-ray and surface brightness
maps (Fabricant et al. 1984; Buote & Canizares 1992, 1996;
Kawahara 2010; Lau et al. 2013), Sunyaev Zel’dovich pres-
sure maps (Sayers et al. 2011), strong gravitational lens-
ing (Soucail et al. 1987), and weak gravitational lensing
(Evans & Bridle 2009; Oguri et al. 2010, 2012), indicates
that cluster-size dark matter halos are not spherical at all.

Additionally, the study of dark matter halos formed in
cosmological simulations has shown that their shapes are
well described by a triaxial model, with a preference for
prolateness over oblateness (Frenk et al. 1988; Dubinski &

Carlberg 1991; Warren et al. 1992; Cole & Lacey 1996; Jing
& Suto 2002; Hopkins et al. 2005; Bailin & Steinmetz 2005;
Kasun & Evrard 2005; Paz et al. 2006; Allgood et al. 2006;
Bett et al. 2007; Mu˜noz-Cuartas et al. 2011; Gao et al. 2012;
Schneider et al. 2012; Despali et al. 2013). Clusters of galax-
ies seem to be less spherical towards their centres (Warren
et al. 1992; Jing & Suto 2002; Bailin & Steinmetz 2005; All-
good et al. 2006; Schneider et al. 2012), probably due to
interactions with the surrounding environment. Besides, tri-
axiality of clusters increases with increasing both the mass
or the redshift of the cluster (Jing & Suto 2002; Allgood
et al. 2006; Mu˜noz-Cuartas et al. 2011), essentially because
they still retain memory of their original shape (which is
inﬂuenced by the direction of the surrounding ﬁlaments or
of the last major merger) and because massive halos were
formed later on (Despali et al. 2014). This scenario has been
conﬁrmed by the recent work of Bonamigo et al. (2015) on
the shape of simulated dark matter halos extracted from the
Millenium XXL simulation (Angulo et al. 2012).

It is well known that the triaxiality of dark matter halos
is particularly important for the study of clusters of galaixes.
In fact, the triaxiality of dark matter halos is supposed to
play a central role in several important properties: cluster
mass and concentration, slope of the inner dark matter den-
sity proﬁle and strong lensing cross sections (Bartelmann
et al. 1998; Meneghetti et al. 2000, 2001; Oguri et al. 2005;
Giocoli et al. 2012a,b). In particular, the triaxiality of lens-
ing galaxy clusters has a substantial impact on the distri-
bution of the largest Einstein radii (Waizmann et al. 2012,
2014). Moreover, semi-analytic models designed to derive
the gravitational lensing properties in galaxy clusters gener-
ally described the mass distribution by a triaxial model as
proposed by Jing & Suto (2002). The results presented by
Jing & Suto (2002) were obtained from numerical simula-
tions which hardly contained any halo above 1014 M(cid:12)h−1.
Therefore, arc statistics from galaxy clusters inferred by
these models (see Giocoli et al. 2012b; Redlich et al. 2012,
for some examples) rely on extrapolations from lower mass
halos. In order to study the impact of the triaxiality, Waiz-
mann et al. (2012) introduced a cut-oﬀ in the distribution
of axis ratios of Jing & Suto (2002) to remove extreme axis
ratios, ﬁnding that the impact of the tail of the axis ra-
tio distribution on the largest Einstein radii distribution is
substantial. However, due to the limited knowledge of the
statistics of halos with extremely small axis ratios, it is not
possible to clearly deﬁne a proper choice of the cut-oﬀ (if
present) until the triaxiality distributions of large halo sam-
ples (up to cluster masses) are derived from large volume
numerical simulations.

Apart from some analyses over few massive clusters
(Schneider et al. 2012; Mu˜noz-Cuartas et al. 2011; Despali
et al. 2014), the work of Bonamigo et al. (2015) is the only
one which presents statistically signiﬁcant predictions on the
shapes of halos with masses above 3×1014 h−1M(cid:12). The Mul-
tiDark suite of cosmological simulations (Klypin et al. 2016)
– in particular the Huge-MultiDark simulation (HMD), con-
taining almost 70 billion particles in a 4h−1Gpc box volume
– allows us to study in detail the shape of simulated dark
matter halos in the cluster mass range with unprecedented
statistics and in the most up-to-date cosmological parame-
ters consistent with the recent results from the Planck col-
laboration.

Moreover, weak gravitational lensing (see Bartelmann
& Schneider 2001, for more details) has been successfully
used in a wide variety of applications: from the mass cali-
bration of galaxy clusters (Ford et al. 2015; Hoekstra et al.
2015; Kettula et al. 2015; Applegate et al. 2016; Mo et al.
2016; Medezinski et al. 2016) to the measurement of the el-
lipticity of dark matter halos (Natarajan & Refregier 2000;
Evans & Bridle 2009; Oguri et al. 2010, 2012; Schrabback
et al. 2015). Since weak lensing is sensitive to halo elliptic-
ity (or triaxiality), a detailed study of the intrinsic shapes of
galaxy-scale simulated halos is essential for present and fu-
ture weak lensing studies, specially in the time of “precision
cosmology”.

In this paper, we aim at characterizing the shape of
simulated dark matter halos over more than four orders of
magnitude in halo masses. To this end:

(i) we have analysed four high resolution dark matter only

simulations within boxes of 4.0, 2.5, 1.0 and 0.4 h−1Gpc

(ii) we investigate the shapes of halos with more than
1000 particles and provide predictions within the halos mass
range 8 × 1015 M(cid:12)h−1 (cid:38) M (cid:38) 3 × 1011 M(cid:12)h−1;

(iii) we investigate the radial dependence of the halo
shapes by measuring the axis ratios: at virial radius (de-
ﬁned at an overdensity ∆virρb) and at an overdensity of
500ρc, along with the alignment of the major axis at these
overdensities;

(iv) additionally, we examine the probability distribution

of the minima (minor-to-major) axis ratio.

This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we
present the simulations and the methodology used to extract
halos and measure their shapes. In Section 3, we present our
results for the four simulated boxes. In Section 4 we compare
our ﬁndings with previous works. We discuss our results and
conclude in Section 5.

2 HALO CATALOGUES

We derived the shape of simulated dark matter halos over
more than four orders of magnitude in halo masses. To this
end we analysed four dark matter only simulations from the
MultiDark cosmological simulation suite. This set of sim-
ulations consist on four cosmological volumes of 4.0, 2.5,
1.0 and 0.4 h−1Gpc cube sides, which are labelled here
as Huge-MultiDark (HMD), Big-MultiDark (BMD), New-
MultiDark (NMD) and Small-MultiDark (SMD), respec-
tively. The largest simulation volume (i.e. the HMD) con-
tains 40963 particles, while the other simulations are per-
formed with 38403 particles. All the simulations were per-
formed in the ΛCDM cosmological model with Planck cos-
mological parameters (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014):
(ΩM , Ωb, ΩΛ, σ8, ns, h) = (0.307, 0.048, 0.693, 0.829, 0.96,
0.678). The particle masses along with the parameters for
each simulation are shown in Table 1. All the information
concerning these simulations is available at the MultiDark
database1 and the CosmoSim database2.

halo ﬁnder (Behroozi et al. 2013). From the Rockstar halo
catalogues we select all the distinct halos at four diﬀerent
redshifts, z = (0.00, 0.33, 0.66, 1.00). Among other parame-
ters, the RockStar halo ﬁnder provides virial masses and
the length of the minor, intermediate and major axis. There-
after we use the deﬁnition of the virial mass as the mass in-
side the radius encompassing a given density contrast ∆virρb
and 500ρc, where ρb and ρc are the mean and the critical
density of the Universe, respectively. The overdensity ∆vir is
computed using the approximation given by Bryan & Nor-
man (1998). For the given cosmology, ∆vir ≈ 333 times the
mean density of the Universe at z = 0.

To ensure a good resolution we limited our analysis to
distinct halos with more than 3,000 particles within Rvir. A
sample build in this way also constitutes a complete volume
limited sample of the HMD, BMD, NMD and SMD box
volumes. In Fig. 1 we show the halo mass function for the
diﬀerent simulations with the Planck cosmology. The Tinker
et al. (2008) mass function provides an excellent ﬁt to z =
0 results and slightly underestimates the mass function at
z = 1.

Additionally, the modelling of non spherical objects is
not simple and can lead to uncertain results. Since highly
elongated halos are mostly due to unrelaxed or merging ha-
los, we restrict the analyses to relaxed halos which are de-
ﬁned by these three criteria (Klypin et al. 2016)
roﬀ < 0.07 , λ < 0.07 , 2K/|W| < 1.5 ,

(1)

where λ is the spin parameter as introduced by Peebles
(1969), 2K/|W| is the virial parameter and roﬀ = |rcm −
(cid:126)rφ|/Rvir is deﬁned as the oﬀset between the centre of mass
(rcm) and the centre of the potential ((cid:126)rφ), in units of the
virial radius. The fractions of relaxed halos as a function
of the halo mass for the diﬀerent simulations are shown
in Fig. 2. At redshift z = 0, this fraction drops from 80%
down to 50% in the mass range considered in this work. The
more massive halos are still forming and are often undergo-
ing merging processes, explaining the negative slope in the
relaxed fraction. At z = 1, this fraction is smaller in about
25% than that at z = 0 within the whole mass range. The
fractions of relaxed halos at z = 0 for each simulation are
shown in Table 1.

3 HALO SHAPES

The common procedure to determine the shape of halos is
to model them as ellipsoids. The length of the minor, inter-
mediate and major axis (c (cid:54) b (cid:54) a) of the ellipsoid can be
computed by diagonalizing the inertia tensor. In this work

cosmological parameters. Diﬀerent colour points correspond to
the diﬀerent simulations at z = 0 (circles) and z = 1 (diamonds).
Error bars are computed considering that the error in the number

and slightly underestimates the mass function at z = 1.

we determine the axis ratios using two forms of the iner-

and the weighted (or reduced) inertia tensor,

is the elliptical distance in the eigenvector coordinate system
from the halo centre to the nth particle. The square root of
the eigenvalues obtained from the diagonalisation of both
expressions provides the axis ratios (c (cid:54) b (cid:54) a), while the
corresponding eigenvectors determine their orientations.
The minor-to-major and intermediate-to-major axis ra-
tios are deﬁned as s ≡ c/a and q ≡ b/a, respectively. Here-

√

after, we denote the virial axis ratios measured at an over-
density ∆virρb (i.e. Rvir) as s and q. Additionally, the axis
ratios measured at an overdensity of 500ρc (R500) are de-
noted as s500 and q500.

The procedure used to recover the shape begins by de-
termining the inertia tensor with s = 1 and q = 1, including
all the particles inside a sphere of a given overdensity. Subse-
quently, new values for s and q are computed as the volume
analysis is deformed along the eigenvectors (proportionally
to the eigenvalues), while keeping the major axis equal to the
original spherical radius. After the deformations of the orig-
inal spherical region, the inertia tensor is calculated again
using the new values of s and q, and including only the parti-
cles within the new ellipsoidal region. This iterative process
can be repeated until the variance in both axis ratios, s and
q, is less than a given tolerance (see Allgood et al. 2006, for
more details). In this work we derive the axis ratios using
three diﬀerent methods:

one iteration) with axis ratios labeled as ssph;

• a weighted inertia tensor in a spherical window (i.e. only
• an iterative weighted inertia tensor (10 iterations) with
• an iterative unweighted or reduced inertia tensor (10

axis ratios labeled as sw;

iterations) with axis ratios labeled as sun.

In order to compare between the diﬀerent methods, we
computed the axis ratios considering the three methods de-
scribed above for relaxed halos in the HMD simulation at
z = 0.00. In Fig. 3 we show the distribution of the dif-
ferent virial axis ratios. For a direct comparison we also
show a scatter plot for the axis ratios sw vs ssph. We per-
form a power-law ﬁt to the data ﬁnding sw = sγ
sph with
γ = 1.86 ± 0.13 and R2 = 0.969 (where R2 is the coeﬃcient
of determination). A similar result was found in Bailin &

Steinmetz (2005) with α =

sw = (−0.13 ± 0.02) + (0.89 ± 0.02)ssph ,

(5)

with higher R2 = 0.996 and σ = 0.02. We also examined
the diﬀerence in the determination of the virial axis ratios
derived with the weighted (sw) and the unweighted (sun)
iterative inertia tensor. Both methods give similar results as
can be clearly seen in Fig. 3 (right panel). Data points are
best ﬁtted by a linear relation as well

sw = (0.096 ± 0.002) + (0.755 ± 0.004)sun ,

with a dispersion of σ = 0.004.

3.1 Minor-to-major axis ratio

As already proposed by many authors (Jing & Suto 2002;
Allgood et al. 2006; Bett et al. 2007; Schneider et al. 2012),
the axis ratios depend on the mass and the redshift of
the halo, however this dependence needs to be tested for
the most massive halos in large simulation boxes. Recently,
Bonamigo et al. (2015) proposed an interesting procedure
to account for the redshift dependence of the halo shapes in
terms of the peak height ν = δc/σ(M), based on the analy-
sis of dark matter halos extracted from the Millennium XXL
simulation. The initial density required for a ﬂuctuation to
collapse at redshift z increases with z as δc(z) = δc/D(z),
with D(z) being the linear growth rate of a density ﬂuctu-
ation normalized to unity at the present time; while σ(M),
which is the variance in the initial density ﬁeld smoothed on
a scale of a uniform sphere of mass M, is higher for small
masses. Given that halos in the past were less massive, the
dependence on time of both quantities compensate with each
other. Within this framework, the characteristic mass (M∗)
is deﬁned as the mass giving ν(z, M∗) = 1 and therefore,
dark matter halos with ν > 1 will have masses larger than
the typical halos collapsing at a given redshift. See appendix
A for the details on how to compute the peak height ν for
an halo of a given mass M.

Hereafter, we used as reference the axis ratios derived

from the iterative weighted inertia tensor (i.e., s = sw).

In Fig. 4 we show the axis ratio s distributions as a func-
tion of the peak height ν of the halo for the four simulated
box volumes (z = 0). Since massive halos still retain memory
of their original shape (which is inﬂuenced by the direction
of the surrounding ﬁlaments or of the last major merger) and
because massive halos were formed later, we expect them to
show smaller axis ratio than low mass halos (with median
s ≈ 0.4), as already pointed out by Jing & Suto (2002);
Allgood et al. (2006); Mu˜noz-Cuartas et al. (2011); Despali
et al. (2014). Moreover, halos at higher redshift are also more
elongated, in agreement with the ﬁndings of Mu˜noz-Cuartas
et al. (2011); Despali et al. (2014). At the same time, axis
ratios for a given halo mass are slightly smaller as the simu-
lated box volume increases (mostly at z = 1). This eﬀect can
be explained because the halo shape is noisier (and there-
fore more likely to be aspherical) for lower particle counts.
Nevertheless, these diﬀerences are less than 20% of the in-
terquartile range of the relation (i.e. IQR = Q3 − Q1).

It is also important to notice that using the same proce-
dure as in Bonamigo et al. (2015), we do not completely re-
move the redshift dependence on the axis ratio distributions

peak. The red solid line indicates the result of the ﬁt with a power-law to the data points (sw (cid:39) s1.86

(Fig. 4). For this reason, we proposed a modiﬁed scaling rela-
tion between the peak height ν and the axis ratio s in log-log
space, which explicitly includes the redshift dependence as
function of the linear growth rate D(z) as follows:

(cid:48)

) ,

log(s) = b + a log (ν

(7)
where we have deﬁned ν(cid:48) = ν D(z)c. Since D(0) = 1 by def-
inition, this scaling relation is identical to the one presented
by Bonamigo et al. (2015) only at z = 0 (or in the case
of c = 0). Therefore, the redshift dependence of the scaling
relation s − ν(cid:48) can be assessed considering that

(cid:48)

(M, z) = ν(M, z) D(z)c = ν0(M)D(z)c−1 .

In Fig. 5 we show the median values for the axis ratio s
as a function of ν(cid:48) for the relaxed halos in the four simulated
boxes. We binned the halos according to their ν in log-log
space and considering ∆log ν = 0.06. The error bars in
the ﬁgure correspond to the 25% and 75% probabilities of
ν(cid:48) in each bin. Data points are best ﬁtted by Eq. 7 with
ac = 0.08 ± 0.01, which reveals a stronger dependence with
redshift than found by Bonamigo et al. (2015). The standard
deviation of the residuals of the ﬁt is σ = 0.008, deﬁned as

where Ri is the residual measured in the i-th bin and Ndof is
the number of degrees of freedom, i.e. the number of bins mi-
nus the number of free parameters in the ﬁt. The procedure
used to perform the ﬁt is a general-purpose optimization
based on Nelder & Mead (1965) algorithm. The best ﬁtted
parameters are shown in Table 2. We also show the results
for the axis ratio measured at ∆ = 500ρc as function of the
corresponding peak height (ν500) for a halo of a given mass
M500 at redshift z.
Given the linear dependence (in log scale) of the axis
ratio as a function of the peak height (ν(cid:48)), we derived
the scaled axis ratios in a similar way as performed by
previous authors: log (s) = a log (ν(cid:48)) + b ⇒ ˜s = 10b =

log-log space for the four simulated boxes. Colour lines correspond
to the median values of s (solid lines and circles for z = 0, while
dashed lines and diamonds for z = 1) in each bin considered. The
dotted lines enclosed the Q1 and Q3 quartiles for the distribution
of s at z = 0.

10log s−a log(ν(cid:48)) = s (ν(cid:48))−a. The black line in Fig. 5 corre-
sponds to the best ﬁt to the median axis ratios with slope
a = −0.295 ± 0.005. The y-intercept point is the logarithm
of the median axis ratio at ν(cid:48) = 1, which is true for M = M∗
at z = 0. Thus, the ﬁt yields to ˜s(z = 0, M∗) = 10b ≈ 0.59.
The scaled axis ratio distribution ˜s shows a fairly uni-
versal distribution almost independently on the mass and
redshift of the halos (Fig. 6). The probability distribution

deviation of the Gaussian distribution:

(eσ2 − 1)e2µ+σ2 = 0.11 .

(11)

In the case of axis ratios measured at 500ρc (see Table 2
for the parameters of the scaling relation), the best ﬁt pa-
rameters are in good agreement within errors with the values
for ∆virρb, but with a lower normalization ˜s500(z = 0, M∗) =
10b ≈ 0.54. The parameters of the log-normal distribution
for ˜s500 are µ = −0.62 and σ = 0.19 (median = 0.54 and
std = 0.10, respectively).

Therefore, we can now study the distribution of axis
ratios for any halo of a given mass (i.e. peak height) and
redshift. First we generate one random value of the scaled
axis from the log-normal distributions, either for ˜s or ˜s500.
Then, by inverting the rescaling relation, s = ˜s ν(cid:48)a, it is also
possible to infer the axis ratio of the halo with peak height
ν(z, M ) = ν(cid:48) D(z)−c, which can then be converted in mass
for a given cosmology at a given redshift.

bins. Diﬀerent line types show the distributions for each simulated
box (including all the redshifts). The black line corresponds to the
best ﬁt log-normal distribution (Eq. 10).

3.2 Intermediate-to-major axis ratio

As already proposed by several authors (Schneider et al.
2012; Bonamigo et al. 2015), the minor-to-major axis ratio is
better described by the rescaled quantity ˜q = (q− s)/(1− s),
that eliminates the limited interval at which q is deﬁned by
construction (q (cid:62) s and q < 1). Fig 7 shows the correlation
between the rescaled axis ratio ˜q and s. We computed the
probability distributions of ˜q in bins of diﬀerent s. We have
ﬁtted the probability distribution of ˜q in each bin of s to a
beta-function (Bonamigo et al. 2015)

p(˜q, α, β) =

1

B(α, β)

˜qα−1(1 − ˜q)β−1 ,

(12)

with two shape parameters α and β and the normalization
factor 1/B(α, β) (requiring that the integral of the probabil-
ity distribution function is equal to unity). The mean value
of the beta distribution is deﬁned as µ = 1/(1 + β/α). From
the ﬁtting procedure, we derived µ and β parameters for
each bin in s. Fig. 8 shows the dependence of these param-
eters on the axis ratio s. The black solid lines in the ﬁgure
correspond to the best ﬁt of these two parameters as follows:

µ(s) = −0.002 + 0.661s
−1.865 .

β(s) = 1.170s

(13)

These results are in fairly good agreement with those re-
ported by Bonamigo et al. (2015). Nevertheless we ﬁnd a
slightly higher mean value of the beta distribution for low

values of s. These two equations give us a functional form of
p(˜q|s), which allows to infer the distribution of ˜q for a given
s along with its scatter.

Additionally, we have repeated this calculation consid-
ering the axis ratios at an overdensity 500ρc (denoted as s500
and ˜q500). The probability distributions of ˜q500 in diﬀerent
bins of s500 are also well described by a beta distribution
with parameters µ500 and β500. The best ﬁt of these two
parameters are

3.3 Triaxiality and major axis alignment

The triaxiality of an ellipsoid can be expressed as (Franx
et al. 1991):

t ≡ a2 − b2

a2 − c2 =

1 − q2
1 − s2 .

(15)

Depending on the value of the parameter t, an ellipsoid is
considered as: oblate if 0 < t < 1/3; triaxial if 1/3 < t < 2/3;
and prolate if 2/3 < t < 1. In Fig. 9 we show the fractions
of halos classiﬁed in this way as a function of the halo mass
for relaxed halos at z = 0. Halos with masses larger than
1014h−1M(cid:12) are dominated by a prolate shape (with frac-
tions above 0.70), while only a few massive halos are found
to be oblate in shape (with fractions below 0.05). Most mas-
sive halos are almost entirely prolate in shape mainly due to
merging processes. This is in support of the idea that halos
with peak height ν > 1 are expected to be undergoing a
higher rate of merging processes than halos with ν < 1, and
that the mergings happen along preferred directions (Knebe
et al. 2004; Faltenbacher et al. 2005; Zentner et al. 2005).
On the other hand, halos with lower masses are described by
a combination of oblate, triaxial and prolate shapes. For the

results of Bonamigo et al. (2015).

less massive halos, the fraction of oblate halos increases up
to 0.20, while the fractions of triaxial and oblate halos vary
between 0.30 and 0.60. Although we do not ﬁnd a strong de-
pendence on the radius at which the triaxiality is measured,
halos seem to be less prolate at Rvir compared to R500.

Since we measured the axis ratios at two diﬀerent over-
densities, we deﬁne θ as the angle between the major axis
at ∆virρb and 500ρc. For the given cosmology, the radius
measured at 500ρc, denoted as R500, roughly corresponds to
0.5Rvir. In Fig. 10 we show the alignment of the major axis
as a function of the axis ratio (s). We ﬁnd that the major

√

axis aligns pretty well with 75% probabilities within θ < 11
deg for the whole range in s (Fig. 10). There is almost no
redshift dependence of the majos axis alignment. Besides,
more spherical halos show larger misalignments with θ (cid:39)
10–11 deg (in median) for s (cid:38) 0.75. The angle between the
major axis decreases to θ (cid:39) 4–5 deg (in median) for halos
s (cid:46) 0.5. Therefore, the alignment seems slightly better for
cluster-sized halos, but this would be simply because less
massive halos are more spherical and thus the direction of
the major axis is less accurate than in the case of cluster-
sized halos. Moreover, since less massive halos tend to show
larger q (thus b ≈ a), the direction of the major axis is arbi-
trary within a plane. In fact, although in a very small frac-
tion, we ﬁnd some halos with misalignments close to θ = 90
deg for halos with the larger axis ratio (close to s = 1).

3.4 Distribution of the minima axis ratio s

As already mentioned, triaxiality of dark matter halos has
a strong impact on the lensing cross sections. Since massive
halos are more prolate than less massive ones, this eﬀect is
even stronger in the case of clusters of galaxies. In partic-
ular, Waizmann et al. (2012) found that the impact of the
tail of the axis ratio distribution on the largest Einstein radii
distribution is substantial. However, they also argued that
due to the limited knowledge of the statistics of extremely
small axis ratios, it is not possible to clearly deﬁne a proper
choice of the cut-oﬀ (if present) until the triaxiality distribu-
tions of large halo samples (up to cluster masses) are studied
in numerical simulations. The results presented in this work
provide scaling relations to characterise the halo triaxiality

grees) as a function of the major axis ratio (s) for relaxed halos

dian values of the distribution at diﬀerent redshifts, while error
bars enclosed the Q1 and Q3 quartiles of s in each bin considered.

which are derived from a huge sample of halos (including
thousands of galaxy clusters).

Since new semi-analytic lensing models could be imple-
mented with our prescriptions on the shape of dark matter
halos, we consider important to check that extremely elon-
gated halos do not propagate through the sampling proce-
dure. For this reason and in order to clarify whether a cut-
oﬀ in the minor-to-major axis ratio distribution is needed or
not, we present in this section the distribution of the min-
ima of the minor-to-major axis ratio. In this analysis we
include all the relaxed halos in the four simulated boxes at
the four redshifts analysed. The cumulative distribution of s,
denoted as P (< s), is shown in Fig. 11. It is clear that more
massive halos are those with lower axis ratios, thus more
elongated. The probability of ﬁnding a halo with s < 0.3
is P (< 0.3) ≈ 10−2 = 0.01, while for extreme values of s
it decreases at P (< 0.1) ≈ 10−5.5 (about 3 halos per mil-
lion). Although not plotted, we do not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant
dependence with redshift on the P (< s) distribution.

4 COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS RESULTS

In Fig. 12 we present a comparison of the results presented
in this work with the measurement of axis ratios from liter-
ature. The median minor-to-major axis ratios (s) as a func-
tion of the halo mass from the four simulated boxes at z = 0
are shown with blue circles (weighted inertia tensor, sw),
while the solid blue line represents the best ﬁt to the data
points. We also show the median axis ratios derived from the
unweighted and spherical inertia tensor using the scaling re-
lations given in Eq. 5 and Eq. 6. Additionally, the red solid
line correspond to the axis ratio s500. Results from other

ertia tensor. The results are in good agreement when com-
paring with our results for sun (dashed blue line). On the
other hand, we ﬁnd slightly lower values of sun for massive
clusters than in Bonamigo et al. (2015). It should be no-
ticed that most of the halos analysed in Bonamigo et al.
(2015) are extracted from the Millenium XXL simulation,
which is performed with WMAP1 cosmological parameters
(ΩM = 0.25, Ωb = 0.045, ΩΛ = 0.75, σ8 = 0.9, h = 0.73).

Finally, the ﬁndings of Despali et al. (2014) are ob-
tained from a set of simulations performed with almost the
same cosmological parameters as the simulations used in this
work, and based on the unweighted inertia tensor. We ﬁnd
a very good agreement with their predictions, even though
they included in the analysis all the halos regardless of their
state of relaxation. Nevertheless, given that their simulated
volumes are smaller than the ones analysed in this work and
the unrelaxed fractions are smaller at lower masses, we do
not expect a strong impact on the distribution of the median
axis ratios. In fact, since unrelaxed halos are typically more
elongated (i.e. with lower axis ratios), we ﬁnd slightly lower
values of s for the unweighted inertia tensor (blue dashed
line) than in Despali et al. (2014).

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a detailed analysis on the triaxiality of
dark matter halos in four diﬀerent computational volumes
from the MultiDark Planck Simulation suite (Klypin et al.
2016). In particular, the Huge-MultiDark simulation allows
us to characterise the shapes of cluster mass halos with
unprecedented statistics (almost 400,000 halos with masses
above 2 × 1014 M(cid:12)h−1). Using the three simulations with
smaller box volumes we extend out analysis to lower masses
down to 3 × 1011 M(cid:12)h−1. The main results of our analysis
can be summarised as follows:

• dark matter haloes are well described by a triaxial
model. In particular, more massive halos are less spheri-
cal than less massive ones, with a tendency of being pro-
late; since modelling of non spherical objects is not simple
and highly elongated halos are mostly due to unrelaxed, we
only analyse relaxed halos based on the criteria proposed by
Klypin et al. (2016);
• the iterative weighted and unweighted inertia tensors
give similar results, while the inertia tensor in a spherical
window is considerably higher than the formers.
• minor-to-major axis ratio can be expressed by a uni-
versal function in terms of the peak heigh ν (Eq. 7). The
peak heigh is related to the halo mass and incorporates the
dependence on the cosmological parameters;
• rescaled minor-to-major axis ratio obtained from this
functional form is well described by a log-normal distribu-
tion within the whole mass range considered;
• dark matter halos are less spherical at inner radius, with
axis ratios measured at R500 lower than those measured at
Rvir on about 9%;
• the conditional intermediate-to-major axis ratio distri-
bution (p(q|s)) is well ﬁtted by a beta distribution, which
depends only on the minor-to-major axis ratio (but not on
the halo mass);
• the angle between the major axis measured at R500 and

authors are shown with thiner lines, the solid part of the
curves represent the mass limits studied in each case.

As it can be seen in Fig. 12, there is a general agreement
in the dependence of s on the halo mass, with more massive
halos showing less spherical shapes. The scatter in the axis
ratio relations, which is constrained within ∼ 15%, is mainly
due to the diﬀerences in the method of measuring the shapes
(Sect. 3) and the deﬁnition of the axis radius (i.e. the over-
density at which it is measured). Besides, it is important
to note that the set of cosmological parameters used in this
work is an updated version of the one used by the rest of
the references. Nevertheless, results from other authors have
been converted to redshift z = 0 for the cosmology assumed
in this work.

Jing & Suto (2002) measured the axis ratios using par-
ticles within the isodensity surface of 2500ρc, which roughly
corresponds to 0.3Rvir. Therefore, for a better comparison
these results should be compared with our results for s500
(red solid line): there is a good agreement, although we ﬁnd a
steeper slope in the relation. In addition, Jing & Suto (2002)
derived the shape properties of dark matter halos extracted
from ﬁve realizations of 100 h−1Mpc box size and from 12
halos with 106 particles within the virial radius, and there-
fore they studied a narrower mass range. In the case of All-
good et al. (2006), where analytical expressions on the radial
dependence of the axis ratios are explicitly given, we convert
their axis ratio relation from 0.3Rvir to Rvir. Although we
ﬁnd a lower slope than Allgood et al. (2006), the results are
in good agreement within the mass range analysed.

Both Allgood et al. (2006) and Schneider et al. (2012)
used the method based on the weighted inertia tensor. In
particular, Schneider et al. (2012) derived the axis ratios
measured at the virial radius, which allows a meaningful
comparison with our results for s (solid blue line). On the
other hand, Mu˜noz-Cuartas et al. (2011) and Bonamigo
et al. (2015) studied the shapes using the unweighted in-

the unweighted inertia tensor at Rvir. Blue circles correspond to the median axis ratio derived from the weighted inertia tensor at Rvir.
Thinner solid lines show the results from other studies in the mass range analysed in each case, while extrapolation outside the mass
range is denoted by thinner dashed lines.

Rvir is below 12 deg for the 75% of the halos analysed, mean-
ing that the direction of the major axis at 0.5Rvir aligns
pretty well with the direction of the major axis at Rvir;
• spherical halos show larger misalignments than triaxial
ones, while halos tend to be more prolate towards the halo
center;
• extremely low axis ratio are mostly due to massive ha-
los; overall, the probability of ﬁnding a halo with s < 0.3
is P (< 0.3) ≈ 10−2 = 0.01, while for extreme values of s it
decreases at P (< 0.1) ≈ 10−5.5 (about 3 halos per million).

Finally, in section 4 we have compared our results with
previous studies. Although there is an overall agreement
with previous works, we ﬁnd a ∼ 15% scatter mainly due to
the diﬀerent methods used to determine the axis ratios (i.e.
inertia tensor, the radius at which the axis are measured).
The best agreement is obtained when comparing simulated
volumes with the same cosmological parameters, as in the
case of Despali et al. (2014).

APPENDIX A: DENSITY PEAK HEIGHT

The density peak height ν for a virialized halo with mass M
at redshift z for a given cosmological model is given by:

ν ≡ δc(z)
σ(M )

,

(A1)

where δc(z) is the critical overdensity of the spherical col-
lapse model (i.e. the initial density required for a ﬂuctua-
tion to collapse at redshift z) and σ(M ) is the variance in
the initial density ﬁeld smoothed on a linear scale R (which
corresponds to the radius of a uniform sphere of mass M ).

12

Vega, J. et al. 2016

The critical overdensity can be rewritten as the collapse
overdensity at present time (δc(z = 0) = δc ≈ 1.69) rescaled
to a given time as follows: δc(z) = δc/D(z), with D(z) being
the linear growth rate of a density ﬂuctuation normalised to
unity at the present time.

For the computation of D(z) we use the approximation
given by Carroll et al. (1992), which can be expressed as
D(z) ∝ g(z)/(1 + z) with:

g(z) =

m − ΩΛ(z) + [1 + Ωm(z)/2] [1 + ΩΛ(z)/70]
Ω4/7

5/2 Ωm(z)

.

The variance in the initial density ﬁeld, σ(M ), is deﬁned

from the power spectrum as:

Figure A1. Peak height as a function of the virial halo mass
for the Planck cosmology. Solid lines correspond with the results
obtained in this work, while dashed lines show the ﬁndings of
Ludlow et al. (2016). Blue and red lines indicate the corresponding
redshift, z = 0 and z = 1, respectively. The green dashed lines
correspond to the best-ﬁt with Eq. A4. The vertical lines indicate
the characteristic masses at each redshift given by ν(z, M∗) = 1.

where ˜W is the Fourier transform of the top-hat window
function. For a given cosmology, both the power spectrum
(P (k)) and the variance in the initial density ﬁeld (σ(M ))
can be computed using a software like HMFcalc (Murray
et al. 2013).

On one hand, the overdensity δc, which depends only
on redshift and not on the mass, increases with redshift due
to D(z); while, on the other hand, the σ(M ) depends on
the mass but not on redshift (since σ(M ) = σ(M, z = 0) by
deﬁnition). Therefore, to compute the peak height ν for an
halo of mass M only the linear growth rate D(z) and the
initial power spectrum P (k) are needed.

Additionally, we proposed a relation between the halo
mass M and the peak height ν. For the cosmological param-
eters given in Sect. 2. At present time, the relation between
ν(z = 0) = ν0 and the halo mass (in log-log space) can be
expressed as a third order polynomial:

log ν0 = n0 + n1 x + n2 x2 + n3 x3 ,

(A4)

with x = log M. As can be clearly seen in Fig. A1, this
relation gives an excellent ﬁt within the whole mass range
studied here with best ﬁt parameters: n0 = −2.42 ± 0.04,
n1 = 0.504 ± 0.009, n2 = −0.0434 ± 0.0007 and n3 =
0.00158 ± 0.00002. This result is in good agreement with
the functional form proposed by Ludlow et al. (2016) for a
similar set of cosmological parameters.
