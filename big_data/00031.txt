We study a simple model of three-dimensional fermions close to a quadratic band touching point,
built from the celebrated Luttinger single-particle Hamiltonian and an attractive contact interac-
tion between the particles. Such a system displays a novel quantum critical point between the
semimetallic and an s-wave superconducting phase at which the low-energy “Luttinger fermions”
are inextricably coupled to the order parameter ﬂuctuations. The quantum critical point is pertur-
batively accessible near four spatial dimensions, where it features nontrivial scaling with dynamical
exponent 1 < z < 2 and emergent rotational and particle-hole symmetries. Some features of the
criticality, such as oscillatory corrections to scaling and its enhanced symmetry, are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Materials with Fermi points such as Dirac or Weyl
semimetals have attracted immense interest recently as
the modiﬁed electronic dispersion provides a portal to the
fascinating phenomenology of quantum condensed mat-
ter. From the point of view of electron-electron correla-
tions, three-dimensional (3D) systems with a quadratic
band touching (QBT) point could be particularly inter-
esting. For example, it has been pointed out long ago
by Abrikosov [1], and reexamined closely more recently
[2], that the long-range nature of the Coulomb interac-
tion may cause the ground state of such a system to be
possibly the simplest instance of a non-Fermi liquid. The
required dispersion arises naturally in 3D gapless semi-
conductors in which spin-orbit coupling is strong enough
so that band inversion causes the Fermi level to lie at
a QBT point [3], famously exempliﬁed by gray tin or
mercury telluride. As the low-energy electronic degrees
of freedom in these systems are described by the Lut-
tinger Hamiltonian [4, 5], one might call them “Luttinger
semimetals”.

Due to the generation of a short-range part of repul-
sive interactions by the long-range Coulomb forces, it has
been argued that Abrikosov’s non-Fermi liquid may be
unstable towards a gapped nematic phase, in which rota-
tional symmetry is spontaneously broken [6, 7]. In par-
ticular, the structure of the 3D Luttinger Hamiltonian
results in a certain frustration which complicates lower-
ing the ground state energy by gapping out the “Lut-
tinger fermions”: Indeed, the rotationally symmetric ex-
citonic (particle-hole) gap is not even available, and the
next best option for the reduction of the energy of the
ﬁlled Fermi sea is to open the cylindrically symmetric
gap, which transforms as a second-rank irreducible ten-
sor under rotations. Novel magnetic instabilities in the
iridates, believed to have an equivalent low-energy quasi-
particle spectrum [8, 9], have also been proposed and
studied [10, 11].

From the point of view of the theory of phase transi-
tions, quantum criticality in the 3D QBT system would
present an interesting and novel example in which low-
energy fermions are coupled to the order parameter, but
within a ﬁeld theory that has at most Galilean, and

not Lorentz invariance. One may wonder, for example,
whether the Galilean invariance [12, 13], similarly to the
Lorentz case, also imposes some constraints on universal
quantities at the transition. For example, the dynami-
cal critical exponent z is ﬁxed to unity in the Lorentz
case [14–18]. Some of these issues have been studied for
the aforementioned nematic quantum critical point [19].
In that case, one can show that for the nematic transi-
tion z remains equal to two to the leading order in the
appropriately formulated ε-expansion.

The Luttinger Hamiltonian describes a spin-orbit cou-
pled system with total angular momentum j = 3/2 and
a parabolic dispersion. The half-integer nature of the
representation of the rotational group dictates that the
(unique) anti-unitary operator that provides the time-
reversal symmetry (TRS) of the Hamiltonian has a neg-
ative square [20], which, as usual, implies Kramers de-
generacy of the spectrum. The same feature of the TRS
operator, however, also guarantees that the energy spec-
trum can be gapped in a rotationally invariant way, but
in the particle-particle channel [21]. The resulting or-
der, which breaks the particle number U (1) symmetry, is
nothing but rotationally invariant s-wave superconduc-
tivity in the present context of spin-orbit coupled sys-
tems. Equivalently, it can be understood as the Ma-
jorana mass in the Galilean-invariant fermionic system
under consideration [21].

Motivated by the growing experimental relevance of 3D
materials with QBT, as well as by the potentially inter-
esting theoretical issues discussed above, we consider here
a 3D system with the Fermi level at the QBT point and
with an attractive, contact, density-density interaction
between the Luttinger fermions. One assumes that such
a featureless interaction, in the spirit of BCS [22], crudely,
may arise from the underlying electron-phonon interac-
tion after the phonons have been integrated out. Since
the non-interacting Gaussian ﬁxed point of the theory is
attractive, as a consequence of the vanishing density of
states at the QBT, the system can have a phase transi-
tion only at a ﬁnite value of the coupling constant [6].
Using the Fierz identities [15] we show that besides the
anticipated s-wave channel, the interaction term is also
equally attractive in yet another, unconventional, super-
conducting channel of the d-wave type, in which ﬁve com-

plex order parameters transform under rotations as the
components of an irreducible tensor of rank (cid:96) = 2. This
more exotic possibility notwithstanding, we argue that
by increasing the coupling constant the zero temperature
transition is still into the isotropic s-wave state, which
we study in detail.
In this work we neglect the repul-
sive long-range Coulomb interaction between fermions,
assuming it to be made suﬃciently weak by a large di-
electric constant of the lattice.

We construct the minimal ﬁeld theory for the com-
plex s-wave superconducting order parameter coupled to
the Luttinger fermions near the QBT point, and study
its universal properties. This is achieved in a controlled
manner within a careful generalization of the ﬁeld the-
ory to d = 4 spatial dimensions, which is identiﬁed as
the upper critical dimension [23]. As a consequence of
the dynamical critical exponent z being equal to two at
the Gaussian ﬁxed point only the “Yukawa” coupling be-
tween the fermions and the order parameter is relevant in
dimensions 2 < d < 4. The universal critical properties
are governed by a ﬁxed point with an enhanced symme-
try, at which, among other things, the dynamical critical
exponent is reduced, z < 2. Both the reduction of the
full rotational symmetry down to the cubic symmetry of
the lattice and the natural particle-hole asymmetry of the
Luttinger Hamiltonian, present away from criticality, are
shown to be irrelevant perturbations at the critical point.
The former perturbation is found to represent the lead-
ing, and remarkably weak, irrelevant coupling. Particle-
hole asymmetry turns out to be particularly interesting
as it provides a rare example of oscillatory corrections to
scaling.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section
we motivate and deﬁne the interacting Hamiltonian we
wish to examine.
In section III we construct the ﬁeld
theory for the Luttinger fermions coupled to the scalar
superconducting order parameter and discuss the struc-
ture of the quantum critical point near the upper critical
dimension. We provide a broader discussion of our ﬁnd-
ings in section IV. Numerous technical details necessary
to derive our results, including the necessary algebra of
real Gell-Mann matrices, are presented in three long ap-
pendices.

II. LUTTINGER FERMIONS WITH

ATTRACTION

A. Luttinger Hamiltonian

We are interested in low-energy excitations described

by the standard Luttinger Hamiltonian [4] given by

2
Herein, (cid:126)p = −i∇, and Ji are spin j = 3/2 angular mo-
mentum operators, which can be represented by 4 × 4
matrices. The phenomenological Luttinger parameters
γ1,2,3 and the band mass m may be determined experi-
mentally or from numerical simulations for a given ma-
terial under consideration. The form of H is dictated by
k · p perturbation theory and the crystal’s cubic symme-
try. We assume |γ1| < 2|γ2|, corresponding to an inverted
band structure, and place the Fermi level at µ = 0 so
that the highest occupied valence band and the (empty)
conduction band touch quadratically. For γ2 = γ3 the
Hamiltonian is fully rotationally symmetric, whereas for
γ2 (cid:54)= γ3 the rotation symmetry is only cubic.
The same Hamiltonian can also be written in an eco-
nomical form by using 4 × 4 euclidean Dirac matrices γa
as

with the γa providing one of the (two possible) irre-
ducible, four-dimensional Hermitian representations of
the ﬁve-component Cliﬀord algebra deﬁned by the an-
ticommutator {γa, γb} = 2δab. The ﬁve functions da((cid:126)p)
are the real (cid:96) = 2 spherical harmonics, given by

For later purpose of generalization to other spatial di-

where d = 3 and Λa are the ﬁve real Gell-Mann matrices
in 3D [19]. The parameters x and δ in Eq. (2) are related
to the Luttinger parameters by means of x = 2γ1/2m
and 1 ∓ δ = −2γ2,3/m. We have chosen units such that
−2(γ2 + γ3)/2m = 1. The energy spectrum of H for
δ = 0 is simply given by (x± 1)p2. Hence, the parameter
0 ≤ x < 1 measures the amount of particle-hole asym-
metry. For nonzero δ the full rotational symmetry is
reduced to the cubic subgroup thereof. In the anisotropy
term proportional to δ, the factor sa distinguishes be-
tween the two diagonal and the three oﬀ-diagonal Gell-
Mann matrices in the deﬁnition in Eq. (4). We choose
sa = +1 for the oﬀ-diagonal (indices 2,3,4) and sa = −1
for the diagonal (indices 1,5) matrices.

The Luttinger Hamiltonian is time-reversal symmetric.
One can construct a representation-independent time-
reversal operator by recalling that the ﬁve anticommutat-
ing γ-matrices can always be chosen such that three are

real and two are imaginary [24]. The reader may under-
stand this as a generalization of the more familiar feature
of the Pauli matrices, where two are real and one imag-
inary. Let us choose a representation in which the two
imaginary ones are γ4 and γ5. The unique anti-unitary
operator which commutes with H and thus represents
the operation of time reversal is then

T = γ45K,

(5)

where γ45 = iγ4γ5 and K is complex conjugation. Ev-
idently, T 2 = −1, and the spectrum of H is doubly
Kramers degenerate. This expresses the fact that the
four-dimensional spinor representation of SO(5), gener-
ated by the ten generators γab = iγaγb, a < b, is pseudo-
real [25]. This, of course, also agrees with the Luttinger
Hamiltonian describing particles of half-integer spin [20].

C. Attractive interactions

We now deﬁne the euclidean zero temperature quan-

tum mechanical action by

S[ψ] =

dτ ddx

(cid:90)

(cid:16)

ψ†(∂τ + H)ψ + u(ψ†ψ)2(cid:17)

3

the (cid:96) = 2 spherical harmonics da transform as the com-
ponents of an irreducible second-rank tensor, the γa do
so as well [6, 19]. Hence, the ﬁve components of the order
parameters φa transform under rotations like the (cid:96) = 2
spherical harmonics, and thus constitute a d-wave order
parameter.

It is easy to show, however, that although the strength
of attraction in both s-wave and d-wave channels appears
to be the same, s-wave ordering is energetically preferred
at the mean-ﬁeld level. The physical reason is that al-
lowing φ (cid:54)= 0 opens up a full rotationally invariant gap,
whereas φa (cid:54)= 0 does not.
In more formal terms, only
a ﬁnite φ would appear in the mean-ﬁeld quasiparticle
Hamiltonian as a rotational invariant (Majorana) mass
term, and as such represents the dominant symmetry
breaking channel [24]. The ground state energy of the
system is therefore reduced more by distributing all of
the condensation energy into the s-wave channel, at least
near the transition point. Therefore, we set φa = 0 here-
after and for the time being only consider the s-wave
transition.

III. QUANTUM CRITICAL POINT

with imaginary time τ , attractive coupling constant
u < 0, and four-component Grassmann ﬁeld ψ(τ, (cid:126)x) =
(ψ1, ψ2, ψ3, ψ4)T. By perturbative power counting we
deduce u ∼ (length)d+z−4, so that for a quadratic dis-
persion with z = 2, a suﬃciently weak coupling u is ir-
relevant for d = 3. There is therefore no usual Cooper
instability for inﬁnitesimal u, essentially because the den-
sity of states vanishes at the QBT [26]. Nevertheless, a
quantum phase transition is still expected to occur at
suﬃciently large coupling, where the system may lower
its ground state energy by opening a gap at the Fermi
level. Furthermore, using the Fierz identity (A11) one
can show that

A. Field theory

We now formulate the non-relativistic ﬁeld theory de-
scribing the system close to its superconducting quan-
tum phase transition and determine its universal prop-
erties. The corresponding Lagrangian comprises low-
energy Luttinger fermions coupled to the ﬂuctuating,
complex, bosonic ﬁeld, whose expectation value repre-
sents the superconducting s-wave order parameter. The
ﬁeld theory needs to reﬂect the cubic symmetry of
the lattice, time-reversal invariance, and a global U (1)-
symmetry due to particle number conservation. The ef-
fective Lagrangian has the form

(ψ†ψ)2 =

(Ls + Ld)

with

Ls = (ψ†γ45ψ∗)(ψTγ45ψ),

5(cid:88)

Ld =

(ψ†γaγ45ψ∗)(ψTγ45γaψ).

(7)

(8)

(9)

a=1

The decomposition in Eq.
(7) suggests that there are
two competing superconducting orders: φ = (cid:104)ψTγ45ψ(cid:105)
and φa = (cid:104)ψTγ45γaψ(cid:105). Since γ45ψ∗ = T ψ, and the time
reversal operator commutes with all spatial transforma-
tions such as rotations, φ is clearly a scalar. Therefore, φ
is the s-wave superconducting order parameter. For the
same reason, the ﬁve ﬁelds φa transform under rotations
the same way as the ﬁve gamma matrices γa. Since the
term daγa in the Hamiltonian is obviously a scalar, and

L(ψ, φ) = ψ†(∂τ + H)ψ + g(φψ†γ45ψ∗ + φ∗ψTγ45ψ)

+ φ∗(y∂τ − c2∂2

τ − ∇2 + r)φ + λ|φ|4.

(10)

The tuning parameter r should be understood as being
proportional to u − uc, where uc < 0 is the critical value
of the attractive interaction. The critical point in this
language is thus located at r = 0. The complex bosonic
ﬁeld φ is coupled to the fermions precisely as a Majorana
mass [21] and its ﬂuctuations are incorporated by the
kinetic term in the second line. We rescaled the ﬁelds
and the time coordinate so that the coeﬃcients of the
terms |∇φ|2, ψ†∂τ ψ, and ψ†Hψ are unity, as discussed
in appendix B. This leaves us with the previously intro-
duced coeﬃcients x and δ, the new coeﬃcients y and c2,
and the Yukawa and self-interaction couplings g and λ,
respectively.

Power counting at the non-interacting Gaussian ﬁxed
point (g = λ = 0) yields the engineering scaling dimen-

sions

dim[g] =

6 − d − z

,

dim[x] = dim[δ] = 0,
dim[y] = 2 − z,
dim[c] = 1 − z,
dim[λ] = 4 − d − z,

(11)

(12)
(13)
(14)
(15)

with z = 2. Hence, for d = 4 the coupling g is marginal,
whereas c and the boson self-interaction term λ are irrel-
evant for any dimensions d > 2. Therefore, we will study
the interacting critical point of the system by generaliz-
ing the theory to d = 4 − ε spatial dimensions, assuming
0 < ε (cid:28) 1. In this way the universal properties of the
quantum phase transition can be captured by retaining
only the couplings which are relevant and marginal at
the Gaussian ﬁxed point, i.e., g, x, y, δ only.

As noted above, for δ = 0 the theory acquires full
rotational symmetry. For x = y = 0 it also possesses
particle-hole symmetry under the discrete transformation

ψ → ψ∗, φ → φ∗, γa → −γ∗
a.

(16)

The third mapping changes the sign of an odd number
of γ-matrices, namely the real ones, and thus exchanges
the two inequivalent irreducible representations of the
ﬁve component Cliﬀord algebra [24]. Due to the enlarged
symmetry of the theory at x = y = δ = 0, these condi-
tions remain invariant under the renormalization group
(RG) transformation which varies the momentum cutoﬀ.
Once the critical point of the RG is found, however, one
needs to check its stability with respect to small but ﬁnite
symmetry breaking parameters. As described shortly, we
will ﬁnd them all to be irrelevant perturbations.

Based on the power counting in Eqs.

(11)-(15) we
are led to studying the superconducting quantum crit-
ical point of the system close to d = 4 dimensions in
terms of the critical (r = 0) eﬀective Lagrangian
Lc(ψ, φ) = ψ†(∂τ + H)ψ + φ∗(y∂τ − ∇2)φ
+ g(φψ†γ45ψ∗ + φ∗ψTγ45ψ),

(17)

which includes all relevant and marginal couplings at the
Gaussian ﬁxed point. The Lagrangian Lc constitutes the
eﬀective low-energy description of the critical theory after
ﬂuctuations with momenta larger than Λ have been inte-
grated out. It will feature the following form-invariance
property under the scale transformation: When integrat-
ing out ﬂuctuations in the momentum interval [Λ/b, Λ]
in a Wilsonian RG procedure with b > 1 and at small
ε = 4 − d > 0, the eﬀective Lagrangian Lc(b) for the mo-
mentum modes lower than Λ/b will remain in the form
of Eq. (17) when the couplings are replaced by appro-
priate b-dependent running couplings [23]. This is true
at the critical point given by r = 0. For small r (cid:54)= 0,
however, there will still be a signiﬁcant crossover range
of momenta (or energies, or temperatures), where critical
scaling can be observed.

leading order in the ε-expansion. Panels a) and b) show the
diagrams for the fermion self-energy Σψ(P ) and boson self-
energy Σφ(P ) in Eqs. (B9) and (B10), respectively. A con-
tinuous line represents a fermion propagator, a dashed one a
boson propagator.

B. RG ﬂow

To the leading, one-loop order in the Yukawa coupling
g, there are only two (self-energy) diagrams to compute,
as depicted in Fig. 1. The usual one-loop diagram that
would renormalize the interaction vertex, as in Fig. 2,
cannot be formed in the present case, so that the ﬂow of
the Yukawa coupling g is solely due to anomalous scaling
terms at this order. The RG evolution of the running
couplings deﬁned by Eq.
(17) for small x, y, δ is then
given by

˙x = −ηψx + 2yg2,

(24)

The coeﬃcients in the RG equations are computed near
d = 4 spatial dimensions in the following sense. The form
of the theory in Eq. (17) is speciﬁc to d = 3, due to the
form of the time reversal operator T , which is dimension-
dependent. In the perturbation theory we therefore fol-
low the γ-matrix algebra as in d = 3, but consider the
remaining loop integrals in general dimension. This, for
example, requires a generalization of the (cid:96) = 2 spherical
harmonics to dimensions other than d = 3, but, never-
theless, can be done unambiguously and fully consistent.
The reader is invited to consult the appendices about the
details of this procedure.

The set of RG ﬂow equations possesses two ﬁxed
points, where the right hand sides of the equations van-
ishes. The ﬁrst describes the Gaussian ﬁxed point with

  matrix elements

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)G(cid:63)

,

Mij =

(28)

is the beta function of the coupling Gi ∈
where βGi
{r, g, x, y, δ}. A stable ﬁxed point is characterized by
having at most one relevant direction, deﬁned through
an eigenvalue θk with positive real part. One relevant
direction in coupling space for both the Gaussian ﬁxed
point and the QCP consists in r, corresponding to the
ﬁne-tuning which is required to ensure r = 0. At the
Gaussian ﬁxed point, the eigenvalues of M are given by
the perturbative scaling dimensions of the coupling in
Eqs. (11)-(13) and thus read {θk} = (2, ε/2, 0, 0, 0) such
that the Gaussian ﬁxed point is not stable.

We now show that, in contrast, the interacting QCP is
stable. For this purpose we ﬁrst discuss the relevant di-
rection, r, and then explore the interesting scaling prop-
erties of the irrelevant couplings. From Eq. (B38) we
deduce the RG ﬂow of r close to the QCP to be

˙r = (2 − ηφ)r − 4g2 + O(g4).

(29)
For log b → ∞ we deﬁne the correlation length exponent
ν such that r(b) ∼ r(1)b1/ν. If ν > 0, we need to ﬁne-
tune r(1) for the critical theory such that this expression
remains ﬁnite for all b. Hence we have

(25)

Since x, y, δ vanish in both cases, it is consistent to con-
sider the RG equations for small x, y, δ only. Never-
theless, it is possible to derive more general beta func-
tions, still proportional to g2 but non-perturbative in
x, y, which we present in appendices B 2 and B 3.

The anomalous scaling behavior at the quantum criti-

cal point (QCP) in Eq. (25) is determined by

(26)

Extrapolating these formulas to ε = 1, i.e., d = 3, one
can estimate that

Equivalently,

ηψ(cid:63) = 0.18, ηφ(cid:63) = 0.82, z(cid:63) = 1.82.

(27)

We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension, and
the consequent deviation of z from two are, albeit ﬁnite,
reasonably small. The boson anomalous dimension, on
the other hand, is rather large, since it is proportional
to the number of fermionic components, which here is
four. This is a common property of this Yukawa-type of
theories [16–18, 27–32].

The corresponding anomalous scaling of observables
can be measured in frequency- and momentum-resolved
experiments such as, for instance, determinations of the
spectral function from ARPES. The dynamical critical
exponent z (cid:54)= 2 will also inﬂuence the temperature de-
pendence of several observables, such as the speciﬁc heat
at the critical point, and the frequency dependence of the
conductivity. The nontrivial behavior of the fermionic
dispersion, encoded in ηψ and z, reﬂects the fact that
the discovered QCP describes fermionic quantum matter
without classical analogue.

C. Corrections to scaling

In order to determine the stability of the QCP we com-
pute the eigenvalues {θk} of the stability matrix M with

ν =

ε + O(ε2).

(31)

The susceptibility exponent γ, which satisﬁes the scaling
relation γ = ν(2 − ηφ), is therefore found to be γ(cid:63) =
1 + O(2) at the QCP, i.e. unchanged from the mean-
ﬁeld value to this order in calculation.
The scaling behavior of the irrelevant couplings {g −
g(cid:63), x, y, δ} close to the critical point, which decouples
from that of r, is given by the eigenvalues

Indeed, we observe all real parts to be negative for ε > 0.
We ﬁnd the leading correction to scaling to be governed
by the parameter δ, i.e., the reduction of full rotation
symmetry to cubic symmetry. As the corresponding
eigenvalue −(2/55)ε is exceptionally small, the leading
correction to scaling needs to be incorporated in any at-
tempt to observe scaling for a realization of the QBT
system on a cubic lattice.

  On the other hand, for possible realizations of the QBT
system with full rotational invariance, such as could be
implementations of the Luttinger Hamiltonian (1) with
ultracold fermions in four distinct hyperﬁne states, we
would have δ = 0 and the leading corrections to scaling
are given by the complex exponents θ1,2 in Eqs.

and (34). The ﬁnite imaginary parts of these eigenvalues
mean that the ﬂow of the couplings is oscillatory in the
x − y plane.

D. Dynamical scaling

Although the term yφ∗∂τ φ disappears at the QCP due
to y(cid:63) = 0, the frequency dependence of the boson prop-
agator is still present, being encoded in the coupling c2
that multiplies ∂2
τ in Eq. (10). Note that c2 as a dimen-
sionful coupling is irrelevant at the Gaussian ﬁxed point.
From the boson self-energy, however, we ﬁnd that when
the Yukawa coupling is ﬁnite, the coupling c is generated
even if absent initially. This can be expressed as the ﬂow
equation

˙c2 = (2 − 2z − ηφ)c2 + g2.

(36)

The coeﬃcient c is thus attracted to a small but ﬁnite
ﬁxed point value

c2
(cid:63) =

3
22

ε.

(37)

Hence, whereas c2 vanishes at the Gaussian ﬁxed point,
it acquires a nonvanishing value c > 0 at the interacting
QCP. Since the ﬁxed point value of the coeﬃcient c2 is
of order of ε, it can be neglected in the lowest order
calculation performed here. It would need to be taken
into account, however, in the two-loop computation.
The ﬁxed point solution from Eq. (37) implies that c
scales as c2 ∼ ξ2z+ηφ−2 relative to the diverging corre-
lation length ξ. The inverse two-point function (or self-
energy) of the bosons at the transition (ξ = ∞) thus
exhibits the scaling form

(cid:16) ω1/z

(cid:17)

,

(38)

p

(cid:104)φ∗(ω, (cid:126)p) φ(ω, (cid:126)p)(cid:105)−1 = p2−ηφfφ

where the scaling function fφ is such that

(cid:40)

fφ(x) ∼

x → 0

1
x2−ηφ x → ∞ .

(39)

Through this mechanism the order parameter inherits the
dynamical scaling from the fermions [19]. An analogous
scaling form, with ηφ replaced by ηψ, can be derived for
the two-point function of the fermions.

IV. DISCUSSION

6

a Feshbach resonance [33–37]. In fact, within a particu-
lar representation the Yukawa vertex can be written as
γ45 = iJ with the Sp(4) invariant tensor J from Ref. [34]
for a four-component Fermi gas. The main diﬀerence, of
course, is that the critical point in the atom gas corre-
sponds to zero particle number density, which facilitates
an exact computation of the universal quantities. This is
not the case here since the Luttinger Hamiltonian is chi-
ral with positive and negative eigenstates, which leads
to nonvanishing particle-hole diagrams, such as those in
Fig. 1 a). One therefore has to deal with the full-blown
many body problem at criticality, resulting in nontrivial
critical exponents.

It may not be too surprising that the cubic anisotropy
turned out to be irrelevant at the critical point, as such
“isotropization” is a rather common feature of RG ﬂow.
Indeed, it is diﬃcult to imagine a discrete spatial sym-
metry alone coexisting with the scale invariance that
emerges at the critical point.
It is still interesting to
observe that the two leading order terms in Eq. (20) al-
most cancelled, leaving a rather small eigenvalue behind.
In this way, the cubic anisotropy assumes the role of the
least irrelevant coupling, which yields the leading correc-
tion to scaling, and which is typically reserved for the
deviation of the interaction from the ﬁxed point value
[23]. A diﬀerent scenario has been observed in Ref. [10],
where the critical point features an emergent anisotropy.
As pointed out in the same reference, this is due to the
Yukawa vertex being γa in this case, such that the trans-
positions appearing in Eq.
(B9) and (B10) cannot be
removed by commutating through the vertex inside the
trace.

Maybe a more remarkable feature of the ﬁeld theory in
Eq. (17) is the irrelevance of the particle-hole asymmetry
in the infrared. In purely bosonic theories that describe
the superﬂuid-to-Mott insulator transition in the Bose–
Hubbard model, for example, the particle-hole symmetry
breaking parameter y is relevant at the XY critical point
[23, 38]. In our case, however, there are two parameters,
x and y, which together account for the asymmetry, and
which are coupled by the RG ﬂow. Their irrelevance then
arises partly as a result of their interplay, and partly due
to the fact that the anomalous dimensions are such that
ηφ > ηψ. It is easy to conceive diﬀerent coeﬃcients in
Eqs. (18) and (19), hypothetical ηψ (cid:29) ηφ for example,
that would yield the opposite result. It is remarkable in
this regard that this does not happen. It is also inter-
esting that the particle-hole asymmetry eigenvalues turn
out to be complex, which is also, to the best of our knowl-
edge, only rarely the case. (Some examples do exist, but
seem to inevitably involve disorder average. See Refs.
[39, 40].) This feature, in particular, also implies that
the ﬂow equations cannot be represented as a gradient
ﬂow, with an underlying positive-deﬁnite metric behind
it [41].

The ﬁeld theory studied in this paper bears some re-
semblance to the theory of the attractive Fermi gas near

To the order of our calculation, we found that the sum
of the fermionic and bosonic anomalous dimensions is

7

which is a relevant perturbation at the Gaussian ﬁxed
point of the Luttinger Hamiltonian [1, 2, 6, 7]. We have
in eﬀect assumed that although the Coulomb interactions
cannot be screened when the chemical potential is right
at the QBT, we can neglect their growth under RG at
the scales of interest due to a suﬃciently large dielectric
constant of the host crystal. A preliminary calculation
suggests, however, that the Coulomb coupling remains
relevant at the interacting QCP studied in this paper as
well. The full treatment that would include the ﬂow of
the Coulomb interaction is somewhat beyond the scope
of the present paper, and will be presented in a future
publication.

Appendix A: Fierz identities

For completeness we brieﬂy recall the derivation of the
Fierz identities by closely following the presentation given
[15]. Let X be the space of Hermitean 4 × 4
in Ref.
matrices and let {ΓA}A=1,...,16 be an orthogonal basis of
X satisfying tr(ΓAΓB) = 4δAB. Every matrix M ∈ X
can then be uniquely represented as

M =

1
4

tr(M ΓA)ΓA.

(A1)

Written in terms of matrix elements this identity reads
Mkl(ΓA)lk(ΓA)ij = 4Mij = 4δikδjlMkl. Since M was
arbitrary we conclude that the relation

δikδjl =

1
4

(ΓA)ij(ΓA)lk

(A2)

holds between the basis vectors ΓA. Given two matrices
M, N ∈ X we consider the expression

tr(M ΓAN ΓB) = MijNkl(ΓA)jk(ΓB)li.

(A3)

Contracting both sides with (ΓA)mn(ΓB)op and using Eq.
(A2) we arrive at

MijNmn =

1
16

tr(M ΓAN ΓB)(ΓA)mj(ΓB)in.

(A4)

Fierz identities consist in the application of Eq.
(A4)
to products of fermion bilinears. Given M, N ∈ X and

simply ε. More precisely, from Eq. (21) it follows that

ηψ + ηφ = ε + O(ε2).

(40)

We expect the higher order terms, however, to modify
this simple looking relation, in contrast to a similar, but
exact result in Higgs scalar electrodynamics [42, 43]. The
two-loop diagram which can be constructed from the
Feynman rules of the critical theory and which poten-
tially leads to a direct renormalization of the Yukawa ver-
tex g, that is, the ﬁnite O(ε2)-contribution in the above
equation, is displayed in Fig. 3.

It is worth noting that quantum ﬂuctuations, as ex-
pected in general, in the present case as well suppress
the superconducting transition temperature. When the
chemical potential is right at the QBT, as being the case
throughout the paper, the critical temperature near the
quantum critical point at T = 0 and u = uc scales as [23]

Tc ∼ (uc − u)zν,

(41)

and we found the relevant combination of the critical
exponents to the leading order to be

zν =

2 − ηψ
2 − ηφ

= 1 +

7
22

ε + O(ε2),

(42)

which is larger than the Gaussian value zν = 1. When
the chemical potential is away from the QBT, on the
other hand, the critical temperature is ﬁnite at an in-
ﬁnitesimal attractive interaction u, and assumes the char-
acteristic BCS form

ln Tc ∝ −

1

(43)

with N (µ) the density of states at the Fermi level µ (cid:54)= 0.
At u = uc, for example,

N (µ) ∼ |µ| d

z −1,

(44)

and is therefore reduced near the QBT by virtue of hav-
ing z < 2. Note that, to the leading order, it is the in-
equality ηφ > ηψ that is related to both the anticipated
suppression of Tc, and to the irrelevance of particle-hole
asymmetry (Eq. (19)).

An important ingredient left out in our considerations
is the long-range Coulomb repulsion between electrons,

  We now aim at relating the term (ψ†ψ)2 to Ls, Ld in
Eqs. (8), (9) by means of the Fierz identity at (cid:126)x = (cid:126)y.
For this purpose we choose

{ΓA} =

1, {γa}a=1,...,5, {γab = iγaγb}a<b

,

(A7)

(cid:110)

(cid:111)

which satisﬁes tr(ΓAΓB) = 4δAB. For the s-wave term
Ls we have M = N = γ45 in Eq. (A6), and ﬁnd

tr(γ45ΓAγ45ΓB) = 4σAδAB,

(A8)
where σA is such that (ΓA)T = σAΓA for ΓA ∈ {1, γa},
whereas (ΓA)T = −σAΓA for ΓA ∈ {γab}. Consequently,

Note that when writing (ψ†γabψ)2 we implicitly assume
a sum over a < b only. In the case of the d-wave term Ld
we have M = γaγ45 and N = M† = γ45γa. Analogous to
the s-wave case we ﬁnd

5(ψ†ψ)2 − 3(ψ†γaψ)2 − (ψ†γabψ)2(cid:105)

Ld =

With Eqs. (A9) and (A10) we have rewritten the su-
perconducting terms Ls and Ld as a linear combination
of the bilinears (ψ†ψ)2, (ψ†γaψ)2, and (ψ†γabψ)2. One
of these terms can be eliminated, however, by expressing
it in terms of the other two. For this we evaluate Eq.
(A5) for M = N = 1 to obtain

(ψ†ψ)2 = − 1

(ψ†ΓAψ)2,

(A11)

hence

Ls + Ld =

(cid:104)
8(ψ†ψ)2 − 2(ψ†ΓAψ)2(cid:105)

= 4(ψ†ψ), (A12)

as stated in Eq. (7) in the main text. One can show that
no further reduction of the fermion bilinears is possible
[6].

Appendix B: Renormalization group equations

In this appendix we provide details on the derivation
of the RG equations (18)-(24) which are used in the main
text to study the superconducting QCP. We ﬁrst recall
general facts about the anomalous scaling of running cou-
plings [23], and then derive the RG equations for the cases
of δ = 0 and δ (cid:54)= 0, separately. Within this section N = 4
is the number of fermion components.

1. Anomalous scaling

To discuss the scaling properties of running couplings
we consider the Lagrangian close to the transition given
by

¯L( ¯ψ, ¯φ) = ¯ψ†( ¯S∂¯τ + Aψda(−i∇)γa − ¯x∇2) ¯ψ
¯τ + ¯r) ¯φ
¯ψ).

+ ¯φ∗(¯y∂¯τ − Aφ∇2 − ¯c2∂2
+ ¯g( ¯φ ¯ψ†γ45
¯ψ∗ + ¯φ∗ ¯ψTγ45

(B1)

For simplicity we assume δ = 0. Notice that we have not
set S = Aψ = Aφ = 1 in Eq. (B1) and label this choice
of parameters by an overbar to the quantities.

Since we are free to re-parametrize the ﬁelds ¯φ and
¯ψ in ¯L we ﬁrst choose them such that the prefactors of
ψ†daγaψ and φ∗(−∇2)φ remain unity during the RG pro-
cedure. This is accomplished by choosing ˆψ = A1/2
¯ψ and
ˆφ = A1/2

¯φ. We then ﬁnd

for the kinetic term. Let us denote S = ¯S/Aψ. Due to
the absence of Lorentz invariance in the non-relativistic
setting we have the additional freedom to choose an
adjusted time-coordinate τ = ¯τ /S such that the pref-
actor of ψ†∂τ ψ is kept at unity as well. The kinetic

part of the action, ¯Skin = (cid:82) d¯τ ddx ¯Lkin, remains in-

L(ψ, φ) = ψ†(cid:16)

variant under this transformation if we rescale ﬁelds
a second time according to ψ = S1/2 ˆψ and φ =
S1/2 ˆφ. The interaction part of the action becomes
ψ S−3/2(φψ†γ45ψ∗ + h.c.). The La-

grangian in the new ﬁeld coordinates is given by

We conclude that the Lagrangian can be brought into the
form (10) by proper re-parametrization of the ﬁelds, and
that the couplings of the rescaled theory acquire multi-
plicative factors of Aψ, Aφ, and S. This manifests in
additive anomalous scaling terms in the beta functions,
as we outline here.

Consider an arbitrary coupling ¯λ (such as ¯x, ¯y, ¯g, . . . )
with scaling dimension d1 = dim[¯λ]. The ﬂow equation
for ¯λ will then have the form

˙¯λ = d1

¯λ + β¯λ.

and the dynamical critical exponent z by means of

˙S = (z − 2)S.

(B7)
The appearance of ηφ, ηψ and ηS = z − 2 on the same
footing as the canonical dimension d1 justiﬁes calling
them anomalous dimensions. By rescaling all running
couplings of the theory by appropriate powers of Aψ, Aφ,
and S, the latter three will eventually disappear from the
beta functions. For practical purposes it is convenient to
compute β¯λ by setting Aψ = Aφ = 1 from the outset and
add the anomalous scaling terms by hand. We apply this
procedure in the following. However, we keep track of
S (cid:54)= 1 and trade it for z at the end of the calculation.

From the construction just presented it is clear that
we might equally well choose the time-coordinate such
that the prefactor of φ∗∂2
τ φ remains unity, and the cor-
responding dynamical critical exponent of bosons thus
necessarily coincides with the fermionic one [7].

2. RG ﬂow with full rotation invariance

We now derive the RG equations assuming δ = 0.
By integrating out ﬂuctuations in the momentum shell
[Λ/b, Λ] to one-loop order we generate a contribution to
the eﬀective Lagrangian (B1) given by
¯ψ + ¯φ∗Σφ

δ ¯L = ¯ψ†Σψ

(B8)

¯φ.

The additional terms Σψ and Σφ constitute loop correc-
tions to the fermion and boson self-energies, respectively.
Their graphic representation is shown in Fig. 1. Note
that there is no renormalization of the coupling ¯g to one-
loop order as no such diagram can be constructed from
the Feynman rules dictated by L. The explicit expres-
sions for the self-energy corrections are

The expressions for the self-energy corrections can be

deed, in our representation where γ1,2,3 are real and γ4,5
are imaginary we have

We now employ an expansion of Eqs. (B18) and (B19)
in powers of ip0 and p2 to read oﬀ the one-loop contribu-
tion to the couplings of Lc. In the loops, the frequency
integration can be evaluated analytically. The momen-
tum integration is facilitated by means of the d-function

area of the d-dimensional unit ball. Furthermore, on the
right hand side of the ﬂow equations we set r = 0, thus
assuming the theory to be close to its critical point, and
neglect the feedback of ¯c2, which is an irrelevant coupling.
To explicate this procedure we ﬁrst compute the con-
tributions to the beta functions which result from Σψ.
They are technically simple as the external momenta and
frequencies can be shifted to the boson propagator. We

and Aψ can now be read oﬀ as the coeﬃcients multiplying
ip01N , p21N , and da((cid:126)p)γa, respectively.

Together with x and y, the coupling δ constitutes a
marginal coupling which could be potentially relevant at
the QCP with δ(cid:63) = x(cid:63) = y(cid:63) = 0.
In this section we
derive the corrections due to δ (cid:54)= 0 onto Σψ and Σφ. We
ﬁnd that δ is irrelevant and attracted to the ﬁxed point
value δ(cid:63) = 0 at the QCP. Furthermore, the corrections
to ˙x and ˙y are of order O(yδ) and O(xδ), respectively.
Hence, the derivation of ﬂow equations from App. B 2
where we set δ = 0 remains valid for the study of the
ﬁxed point structure of the QCP, which only requires the
ﬂow equations for small x, y, δ. Note that, in the spirit of
the discussion in the beginning of App. B 1, we may ﬁrst
introduce the coupling ¯δ in ¯L and then deﬁne δ = ¯δ/Aψ.
Below we show that the corrections to Σψ and Σφ for

small x, y to order O(δ2) are given by

that z and ˙x also acquire an implicit dependence on δ

section we give a closed formula for the computation of
such integrals.

We start by discussing the cases n = 1, 2. For n = 1

the following we give an alternative route to evaluate the
integral.

We show that for any function f (q2) we have

(cid:126)q

The integrand is odd except for the terms with i = j.
We can thus replace qiqj = q2δij and arrive at

f (q2)da((cid:126)q) =

d

2(d − 1)

f (q2)q2(Λa)ii = 0

Again we have to build a symmetric tensor out of the qi.
We apply the ansatz

qiqjqmqn = Aq4(δijδmn + δimδjn + δinδjm)

and contract the pairs (i, j) and (m, n). This leaves us
with A = 1

n = 1, 2 also applies to the cases n > 2: Rewrite the
integrand in terms of the Gell-Mann matrices and sym-
metrize it such that it is even under sign changes of the
qi. The remaining integrand is f (q2)q2n times a prefactor
depending on d, n, and the structure constants Jab...c. In

2. Some sums of real Gell-Mann matrices

In this section we proof Eqs. (B70)-(B72). For this

purpose we denote the square of Λa by

We claim that Da is a diagonal matrix. This is obvious
for the diagonal Λas. For an oﬀ-diagonal Λa we use the
bra-ket notation of Ref. [19] and write Λa = |j(cid:105)(cid:104)k|+|k(cid:105)(cid:104)j|
with 1 ≤ j, k ≤ d and j (cid:54)= k. We then ﬁnd (Λa)2 =
|j(cid:105)(cid:104)j| + |k(cid:105)(cid:104)k|, which is diagonal.
In fact, for an oﬀ-
diagonal Λa, Da is zero except for two entries of unity
along the diagonal. The positions of these unities along
the diagonal are uniformly distributed among the oﬀ-
diagonal Λas. Thus when summing up all d(d − 1)/2
ones of them, each contributes two unities to some of the
d diagonal elements and we arrive at
