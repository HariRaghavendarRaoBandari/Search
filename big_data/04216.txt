QUARTER-BPS SOLUTIONS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL N = 16

SUPERGRAVITY AND THE LIOUVILLE EQUATION

GEORGE MOUTSOPOULOS

Abstract. We show how by assuming at least 8 real timelike supersymmetries in the
maximally supersymmetric three-dimensional ungauged supergravity and a further sim-
plifying Ansatz, we are naturally led to a pair of Liouville ﬁeld equations. We also show
that there are no solutions that preserve only 6 real timelike supersymmetries. The solu-
tion relies on the classiﬁcation of complex spinors of Spin(8) to which the problem quickly
reduces.

1. Introduction

The three-dimensional, maximally supersymmetric, ungauged supergravity was found
in [1] and is related to the dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity on an
internal torus. The size of the E8 global symmetry and N = 16 supersymmetry means that
the solution space can be easily probed by assuming those solutions that preserve enough
symmetry or supersymmetry. These solutions are interesting for the study of the theory on
its own merit as a three-dimensional supersymmetric model, but also because they oxidize
to higher-dimensional supersymmetric string backgrounds. The latter are of special interest

in string theory, for instance when the E8-monodromies are not in the automorphisms of
the internal torus and so the higher-dimensional geometry is only locally well-deﬁned [2, 3].
The bosonic content of the three-dimensional maximally supersymmetric supergravity
multiplet is a metric and an E8/Spin(16) coset scalar. A timelike solution of a supergravity
theory is by deﬁnition one with a Killing spinor that squares to a timelike vector. Since
they are related to the BPS projection equations of supersymmetric branes in the higher-
dimensional theory, we will also call them BPS solutions. The timelike solutions of the
N = 16 theory were classiﬁed recently in [3] by using a novel scheme: each timelike solution
is necessarily related to an element Pz ∈ (e8/spin(16))C that is nilpotent as an element in
8 . There are ten such nilpotent orbits under the action of Spin(16)C that correspond to
eC
timelike solutions, which preserve diﬀerent amounts of supersymmetry, and for each orbit
a representative Pz of the orbit was given that is indeed a solution to the theory.

The classiﬁcation of [3] is a novel and ingenious classiﬁcation scheme, where (a) not
all the equations of motion are imposed and the classiﬁcation becomes algebraic, and (b)
the solutions are classiﬁed up to the action of Spin(16)C on certain degrees of freedom.
That is, one uses the complexiﬁcation of the local symmetry of the theory that is not a
symmetry of the theory and the classiﬁcation is not on-shell. Finding known solutions that
fall into each class is then a separate task, which completes the classiﬁcation. Our original
motivation was an attempt to solve for (all) timelike supersymmetric solutions, where we
would use the equations of motion fully and only use the local symmetry of the theory to
identify solutions. This is a very diﬃcult problem, if indeed solvable in full generality. One
method that follows [3] is to split each relevant supersymmetric Spin(16)C-orbit in [3] into
its constituent Spin(16)-orbits, each of which is a distinct candidate solution to the theory,
but that is a again a daunting task.

What we present here is a relatively straightforward method, diﬀerent to the classiﬁcation
of [3], in order to address our problem. Namely, in our method we begin by classifying the
solutions under the real [sic] local symmetry Spin(16) of the theory - directly. But it is a
method with which we soon reach a deadlock and we make two simplifying assumptions
in order to proceed. Firstly, we assume enough supersymmetry in order to simplify the
problem. More precisely, a quarter supersymmetry reduces some of the scalar degrees
of freedom to spinors of Spin(8) that we know how to classify. Secondly, a simplifying
Ansatz on the remaining scalar degrees of freedom, which is expressed very naturally in our
formalism, reduces all equations of motion to two independent two-dimensional Liouville
ﬁeld equations in euclidean signature. A summary of this work is then how the Liouville
equation appears naturally in quarter-BPS solutions of the theory. Our note presents an
immediate proposal for future work, which is how to overcome these two assumptions.

In the following sections, we consecutively present the theory (§2), describe the implica-
tions of one (§3) and more than one (§4) timelike supersymmetries, and give our solution
for quarter-BPS solutions (§5) under a simplifying Ansatz. The naturalness or generality
of this Ansatz, which ﬁrst appears in equation (72), is discussed in section §6. In section
§7 we show that 3/16-BPS implies 1/4-BPS solutions. We conclude with a short discussion

and there are two supplementary appendices. The spinor representations that we use are
ﬁrst introduced in the second half of section §4.

The split real form e8 is the Lie algebra that decomposes symmetrically under the Cartan

involution as

deﬁnite metric η on V16. The second bracket is the spin representation ρspin of spin(16)

Here, η was naturally extended to a metric on spin(16) ∼= Λ2V16 ⊂ V16 ⊗ V16. Note that all
positive-deﬁnite choices for h−, −i give isomorphic Lie algebras, but a change of sign in (9)
deﬁnes the maximally compact real form. Explicit bases and representations for spin(16),
V16 and ∆16 will only be introduced in section §4. More generally, we will use the symbols

The pull-pack of the bundle E8 → E8/Spin(16) by the map V deﬁnes a principal Spin(16)
bundle over M with which we associate the spacetime fermions. The gravitino is a real
Rarita-Schwinger ﬁeld with values in V16, and the dilatino is a real spacetime-chiral spinor
with values in ∆−
16. The supersymmetries of the theory are given by real spacetime-chiral
spinor ﬁelds with values in V16. Since spin(1, 2) ∼= sl(2, R), there are in total 2 × 16 = 32
real local supersymmetries.

The action of the full theory and the supersymmetry variations were found in [1]. In this
note we are only interested in bosonic backgrounds given by (g, V). In practice, we denote
by V a representative in the coset E8/Spin(16), which depends on a choice of a local section
of E8 → E8/Spin(16). That is, we use the so-called gauge formulation of the non-linear
sigma model instead of coordinates on E8/Spin(16). We decompose the pull-back of the
Maurer-Cartan form V−1dV under (1) and deﬁne

V−1dV = Q + P ∈ Γ(cid:0)spin(16) ⊗ T ∗M ⊕ ∆+

16 ⊗ T ∗M(cid:1) .

Here and in the following, Γ (E) denotes the space of sections of a bundle E over M, or of
a bundle over M with ﬁber E. The equations of motion are given by the non-linear sigma
model action coupled to Einstein gravity without cosmological constant

(11)

Under a global γ ∈ E8 transformation with local compensating gauge tranformation h ∈
Spin(16), that is V(x) 7→ γV(x)h, the element P transforms as a spinor P 7→ e[h,−]P and
since h−, −i is Spin(16)-invariant, the action is E8-invariant.

Let us introduce local spacetime coordinate indices µ, ν = 0, 1, 2. The Einstein equation

and scalars’ equation are respectively

Rµν − hPµ, Pν i = 0 ,
(∇µ + Qµ) P µ = 0 ,

we may solve for P and Q subject to the integrability equations (14)-(15).

Since the Killing spinor ǫ appears linearly in its deﬁning equations, we will treat it as
commuting (Grassmann-even). We will call a n/32-supersymmetric solution one that pre-
serves n real supersymmetries, i.e. admits n independent Killing spinors, and a quarter-
supersymmetric solution is one that admits 8 independent Killing spinors.

for X ∈ T M .

3. One Timelike Supersymmetry

Assume now a solution that possesses a Killing spinor ǫ. It follows from the closure of
the local supersymmetry algebra of a supergravity theory that, a Killing vector may always
be formed from a Killing spinor. For the theory at hand

K = η(¯ǫ, dxµ · ǫ) ∂µ ∈ Γ (T M ) ,

(21)
is a Killing vector. In the deﬁnition of K above, ¯ǫ is the Spin(1, 2) = SL(2, R) dual of ǫ, dxµ
acts by Cliﬀord multiplication of Cl(T M ) on ǫ, and η contracts the V16 components of the
two appearances of the ǫ. The Killing vector K is either null or timelike with respect to the
metric g. In the ﬁrst case, the spacetime takes the form of a supersymmetric pp-wave and
has been solved completely, see e.g. [3]. Our focus here is on the timelike case, g(K, K) > 0.
The timelike case is also very restrictive in the theory at hand. Indeed, notice that since
ǫ is parallel with respect to ∇ + Q and Q is in spin(16), then K which is a spin(16)-scalar is
also parallel with respect to ∇, i.e. ∇K = 0. A ∇-parallel timelike vector K implies that
we may bring the metric to the ultrastatic form

g = dt2 − e2σ(z,¯z)dzd¯z ,

(22)

where K = ∂t is deﬁned everywhere, t is a global function, and the complex coordinate

(23)
and σ are deﬁned at least locally. The Killing vector K also leaves V invariant up to a local
spin(16) transformation and we choose a gauge for which Qt = Pt = 0 and the

are independent of t.

As was shown in [3], the equations of motion and Killing spinor equations simplify for a
timelike solution in the complex coordinates (23). The dilatino variation (18) is central in
the simpliﬁcation. We choose the spacetime gamma matrices

and from the spin(1, 2) spinor components ǫα, α = 1, 2, we deﬁne

The dilatino Killing spinor (18) then becomes

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

with ǫ¯z again, by using the Cliﬀord algebra (5) we can show that ǫz is a complex vector of

16(cid:1) acts with Cliﬀord multiplication on Pz ∈ Γ(cid:0)(∆+

16)C(cid:1). If we act on (28)

ǫ¯z · Pz = 0 ,

where ǫ¯z ∈ Γ(cid:0)V C
16(cid:1) that is null:
Γ(cid:0)V C

Complex null vectors can only be of the form

ǫz · ǫz = 0 .

ǫz = N (e1 + i e2)

where e1 and e2 are real vectors of V16 that are orthonormal with respect to η, while N can
be chosen to be real and positive. The dilatino Killing spinor equation (28) becomes the
projection condition

− i e1 · e2 · Pz = Pz .

(31)
Note that here and in the following, what we call a supersymmetry projection condition is a
projection on Pz with the projection operator constructed out of the Killing spinor. This is
diﬀerent to the usual notion of a BPS projection in higher dimensions, that is a projection on
the Killing spinor with the projection operator constructed out of a supersymmetric brane
worldvolume. In our case, we use it to restrict Pz. We may now turn to the equations of
motion for a timelike solution.

Let us extend the inner product h−, −i on ∆+

that we also denote by h−, −i,

16(cid:1)C
16 to the hermitian inner product on(cid:0)∆+

.

(32)

Because of the condition (31) and that h−, −i is spin(16)-invariant, we may show that

(cid:10)p, i p′(cid:11) =(cid:10)−i p, p′(cid:11) = i(cid:10)p, p′(cid:11)

for p, p′ ∈(cid:0)∆+
16(cid:1)C

hP¯z, Pzi = hP¯z, i e1 ∧ e2 · Pzi = hi e1 ∧ e2 · P¯z, Pzi = − hP¯z, Pzi = 0 .

(33)

The Ricci tensor for the ultrastatic metric has Rtt = 0, Rxx = Ryy and Rxy = 0 which is
consistent with the Einstein equation of motion (12) with Pt = 0 and hP¯z, Pzi = 0 as in
(33). The only remaining non-trivial component of the Einstein equation of motion is

− 2∂z∂¯zσ = hPz, Pzi .

(34)

1/4−BPS SOLUTIONS IN 3D N = 16 AND LIOUVILLE

The equation of motion (13) for Pz and the integrability equation (14) for Pz are respectively
the real and imaginary part of the single complex equation

(35)

(36)

Finally, the integrability equation (15) for Q is

(∂¯z + Q¯z) Pz = 0 .

Im(cid:18)∂¯zQz +

[Q¯z, Qz](cid:19) =

i[P¯z, Pz] .

Here, we have extended complex-bilinearly the bracket [−, −] on eC
8 .

The t-component of the gravitino Killing spinor equation (17) is simply that the Killing
spinor is t-independent. Interestingly, the integrability of the gravitino Killing spinor equa-
tion in the x − y components is automatically satisﬁed provided the dilatino Killing spinor
equation (28), the Einstein equation (34) and the integrability equation (36) for Q hold,
see [3] for the proof. A timelike solution of the theory is thus subject to the equations of
motion (34), (35), (36) and the projection condition (31). We note that (34) is the only
one that involves the conformal factor e2σ of the ultrastatic metric and we may thus focus
on the rest.

In the next section we will also introduce explicit spinor representations, and it will be

useful to denote complex conjugation on Pz as an anti-linear involution C, i.e.

(37)
Let us extend complex-bilinearly the metric η on (V16)C and the Lie bracket [−, −] on eC

16(cid:1)C and q ∈ spin(16)C. We will use this formula to calculate the Lie

4. Many Timelike Supersymmetries

In this section, we investigate the consequences of the existence of more than one Killing
spinor, generalizing the projection (31) on Pz for one Killing spinor. We also introduce
an explicit ∆+
16 representation in terms of an auxiliary vector space U, in which we write
the conditions on Pz. We observe that a timelike supersymmetric solution preserves an
even amount of real supersymmetry, because if ǫz is a Killing spinor then so is i ǫz. This is
clear from the dilatino Killing spinor equation (28), which deﬁnes timelike Killing spinors
subject to the equations of motion (34)-(36). We henceforth assume a timelike solution
that preserves 2n real supersymmetries.

Let us then assume n linearly independent over C Killing spinors ǫi

For each Killing spinor equation, i.e. ǫi
over (i, j) and use the Cliﬀord algebra (5). We may thus show that the ǫi
and orthogonal to each other:

¯z · Pz = 0, we Cliﬀord multiply with ǫj

z ∈ Γ(cid:0)V C

16(cid:1), i = 1, . . . n.

z) = 0 .

GEORGE MOUTSOPOULOS

Let us use an orthonormal basis eI, I = 1, . . . , 16, of V16. We may use SO(16) to rotate the
ǫi
z to the canonical form

ǫ1
z = N11 (e1 + i e9) ,
ǫ2
z = N21 (e1 + i e9) + N22 (e2 + i e10) ,
...
ǫn
z = Nn1 (e1 + i e9) + Nn2 (e2 + i e10) + · · · + Nnn (en + i en+8) .

(40)

Indeed, assuming we have rotated the ﬁrst n′ < n Killing spinors, the stabilizer is SO(16 −
2n′) that can be used to rotate the real and imaginary part of the next Killing spinor so that
it is in the span of the previous Killing spinors plus en′ and en′+8. The coeﬃcients in (40)
are restricted by (39), and we arrive at a generalization of the left-diagonal decomposition
of a matrix. This proof by construction is complete provided the diagonal coeﬃcients Nii
are not zero, which we show in the appendix A. Since Spin(16) is a local symmetry of the
theory, we are studying the same timelike solution.

The Killing spinor equations (28) for ǫi

z in the canonical form (40) are equivalent to the

compatible supersymmetry projection conditions

− i ei · ei+8 · Pz = Pz ,

(41)
Note that these are projection conditions on Pz, and not projections on the Killing spinor
ǫz. In writing the projection conditions, we have used Spin(16), which rotated the Killing
spinors and Pz. The remaining freedom in Spin(16) is the group U (1)n × Spin(16 − 2n)
generated by

i = 1, 2, . . . , n .

{ei ∧ ei+8}1≤i≤n ⊕ {ei ∧ ej+8, ei ∧ ej, ei+8 ∧ ej+8}n<i,j≤8 .

(42)

It leaves the projections in (41) invariant and acts on Pz as a complex spinor of Spin(16−2n)
with weights under the U (1)’s given by (41).

The main result of this section is (41), but in order to proceed we need an explicit solution

to the projection conditions, and so we need an explicit representation of(cid:0)∆+

Pz belongs. We use a representation of Cl(V16) in terms of Λ∗U C, the exterior algebra of
the complexiﬁcation of an 8-dimensional real metric vector space U,

16(cid:1)C to which

(43)
where the basis vectors ˜ei, i = 1, 2, . . . , 8, are to be thought of as orthonormal. Let p ∈ Λ∗U C
be a complex form. The representation of the Cliﬀord algebra is given by

U = R8 h˜e1, . . . , ˜e8i ,

ei · p = ˜ei ∧ p − i˜eip ,

e8+i · p = i (˜ei ∧ p + i˜eip) ,

(44a)
(44b)

for i = 1, . . . , 8. One may indeed conﬁrm that (5) is satisﬁed

(45)
for all I, J = 1, . . . , 16. The form p is a complex spinor of Spin(16) with indeﬁnite chirality,
i.e. Λ∗U C ∼= ∆C

We denote by dvol8 = ˜e1 ∧ ˜e2 ∧ · · · ∧ ˜e8 the volume form of U and by ∗8 the Hodge star.

A hermitian inner product on Λ∗U C is deﬁned by

for any p, p′ ∈ Λ∗U C. Note that here we use complex conjugation p∗ with respect to the
real space U and is not the same as C in (37). By using the identity ˜ei ∧ ∗8p = ∗8i˜eip and
(44), one may show that the eI are anti-hermitian wih respect to h−, −i,

It follows that h−, −i is Spin(16)-invariant,

to ﬁx P 0

z to a given form.

5. Quarter-BPS Solutions

In this section we will focus on n = 4. That is, we assume a solution with at least 4
complex Killing spinors that preserve 8 real supersymmetries out of a possible 32. The

group Spin(8) acts transitively on(cid:0)∆+

Spin(8)-orbits of spinors in order to ﬁx P 0
z and Pz in (53). However, in order to solve the
equations of motion, we will need one further assumption on Qz, which we make towards
the end of this section.

We use the spin representation of Spin(8) in terms of Λ∗W C, where

W = R4 h˜e5, ˜e6, ˜e7, ˜e8i .

(56)

It is well-known that a real chiral spinor in ∆+
8 is in the same Spin(8)-orbit as 1 + ˜e5 ∧
˜e6 ∧ ˜e7 ∧ ˜e8 up to scale with stability Spin(7)+, under which the representations of Spin(8)
reduce as follows:

Spin(7)+

Spin(7)+

= ∆7 .

(57)

(58)

(59)

The last equation can be seen as a consequence of Spin(8) triality. The vector representation
V7 of Spin(7)+ is spanned by

V7 = R hi(1 − ˜e5 ∧ ˜e6 ∧ ˜e7 ∧ ˜e8)i ⊕nλ ∈ Λ2W C : λ = ∗8λ∗o ,

(60)

while ∆7 in (59) is the real 8-dimensional spin representation of Spin(7)+. Since we need
z , we use the stabilizer Spin(7)+ to ﬁx a second real spinor in ∆+
to ﬁx a complex spinor P 0
8 .
A second spinor in ∆+
8 decomposes as in (58) with a component along 1 + ˜e5 ∧ ˜e6 ∧ ˜e7 ∧ ˜e8
and a part in V7, but Spin(7)+ acts on the vector representation V7 transitively. The part in
V7 can thus be brought to i(1 − ˜e5 ∧ ˜e6 ∧ ˜e7 ∧ ˜e8) with stability Spin(6) = SU(4) ⊂ Spin(7)+.
The representations of Spin(7)+ decompose under SU(4)

with ˜a, ˜b, ˜c ∈ R. It is convenient to write P 0

in terms of the Cliﬀord representation (44). By using et L1, we can make either a or b real,
which would leave us again with three real parameters. The subgroup SU(4) ⊂ Spin(8)
that leaves P 0

z invariant is generated by the Lie algebra elements

It is time to turn to the element

Pz = ˜e1 ∧ ˜e2 ∧ ˜e3 ∧ ˜e4 ∧ (a + b ˜e5 ∧ ˜e6 ∧ ˜e7 ∧ ˜e8)

(70)

and since Qz belongs to the complexiﬁed Spin(16)C, it is convenient to allow a, b ∈ C. There
are two U (1)’s in Spin(16) that are central to our analysis. The ﬁrst U (1) is generated by
L1 that was deﬁned in (67) and acts on Pz by sending (a, b) 7→ (ia, −ib). The second U (1)
is generated by

and acts on Pz sending (a, b) 7→ (−ia, −ib). We promote the linear analysis to local sections
over the manifold and a, b become functions of (z, ¯z). Let us then write the Ansatz

for complex functions q1(z, ¯z) and q2(z, ¯z). The equation of motion (35) for Pz and the
integrability of Qz (36) via (38) become

Qz = q1 L1 + q2 L2

(72)

∂¯za + i¯q1a − i¯q2a = 0 ,
∂¯zb − i¯q1b − i¯q2b = 0 ,
2 Im (∂¯zq1) = i hPz, L1Pzi = |b|2 − |a|2 ,
2 Im (∂¯zq2) = i hPz, L2Pzi = |b|2 + |a|2 .

(73)
(74)
(75)
(76)

We may use the U (1) × U (1) ⊂ Spin(16) symmetry that is generated by L1 and L2 in order
to set a and b real. If both a and b are non-zero, we may substitute the equations for ∂¯zq1
and ∂¯zq2 in order to derive the quadratic equations
∂z∂¯z ln a = a2 ,
∂z∂¯z ln b = b2 .

(77)
(78)

This is a pair of Liouville’s ﬁeld equation. If one of a or b is zero, we only get one Liouville
ﬁeld equation.

The Ansatz (72) is interesting, as far as test solutions go, because it leads to a local

closed-form solution:

|∂zf1|2

a2 =

b2 =

(1 − |f1|2)2 = −∂z∂¯z ln(cid:0)1 − |f1(z)|2(cid:1) ,
(1 − |f2|2)2 = −∂z∂¯z ln(cid:0)1 − |f2(z)|2(cid:1) ,

(80)

(81)

for two arbitrary functions f1,2(z) that are deﬁned locally on some patch. In solving the
equations of motion (34)-(36), we have ﬁxed the conformal Liouville symmetry completely.

6. The Ansatz

The solutions (79)-(81) are a very large class of local solutions that are interesting to
study. For instance, we may generalize the local holomorphic functions to meromorphic
functions on an N-punctured two-sphere, with ∞ representing spatial inﬁnity and the
poles representing compatible 1/4−BPS states. One may then study their properties such
as coset charges, asymptotics, monodromies, etc. Yet another point of interest, which is
relevant to this work, is how general the Ansatz (72) is and whether it can be somehow
relaxed. We were not able to show that the Ansatz is the most general solution, but at the
same time we did not ﬁnd any straightforward way of generalizing it. In this section, we
present a few details about the naturalness of the Ansatz in our formalism.

1/4−BPS SOLUTIONS IN 3D N = 16 AND LIOUVILLE

Let us not assume (72), but the element Pz is brought to the form (70) on any local patch
at will. It is convenient to rewrite the equation of motion (35) for Pz and the integrability
of Qz (36), again here:

Im(cid:18)∂¯zQz +

i[P¯z, Pz] .

∂¯zPz + Q¯zPz = 0 ,
1
2

[Q¯z, Qz](cid:19) =

1
2

(82)

(83)

Having ﬁxed Pz as in (70), then due to the terms ∂¯zPz and Q¯zPz in (82), the connection
one-form Q¯z has to belong to the subalgebra of spin(16)C that preserves the form of Pz

in terms of generic (a, b) ∈ Γ(cid:0)C2(cid:1). That is, Q¯z has to eﬀectively act on (a, b) as a C-
linear endomorphism of Γ(cid:0)C2(cid:1), but it may also have components in the stabilizer of Pz in

spin(16)C. There is no other possibility. Note that the part of Q¯z that acts eﬀectively on
(a, b) can only be deﬁned modulo the stabilizer. A linear algebra calculation shows that the
full subalgebra is generated by the L1 and L2 that act eﬀectively on Pz and the stabilizer
of Pz in spin(16)C. That is, modulo the stabilizer the eﬀective action is only given by the
action of L1 and L2. The Ansatz (72) assumes that Qz only has components in L1 and L2.
The stability subalgebra of Pz in spin(16)C, in which a putative solution for Q¯z might

have some components, is generated by three types of elements:

(a) elements in the complexiﬁcation of u(1)3 ⊂ u(1)4 ⊂ u(1)4 ⊕ spin(8) that are gener-

ated by

e1 ∧ e9 − e2 ∧ e10 ,

e1 ∧ e9 − e3 ∧ e11 and

e1 ∧ e9 − e4 ∧ e12 ,

(84)

which anninhilate Pz because of the projection conditions,

(b) elements in the complexiﬁcation su(4)C = sl(4, C), where su(4) was deﬁned in (68),

and

(c) elements generated by

4Xi,j=1

ηij (ei+4 ∧ ej+4 − ei+12 ∧ ej+12) +

4Xi,j=1

provided that η and ζ are related as

ζij (ei+4 ∧ ej+12 − ej+4 ∧ ei+12) ,

(85)

a ζ − b ∗4 ζ + i a η + i b ∗4 η = 0

(86)

where we think of η and ζ as complex two-forms in Λ2W C.

The elements of type (a) and (b) with real coeﬃcients also describe the real stability sub-
algebra u(1)3 ⊕ su(4) of Pz in spin(16). The elements of type (c) have non-trivial solutions
and, in contrast to the stability generators of type (a) and (b), they depend on the a and
b in Pz. For instance, if we write the dual and anti-self-dual parts of η and ζ as η± and ζ ±
respectively, then (86) becomes

i(a ∓ b)ζ ± = (a ± b)η± .

(87)

14

GEORGE MOUTSOPOULOS

There is no purely real solution of (87), that is a solution with η∗ = η and ζ ∗ = ζ, unless
|a| = |b|. Nevertheless, Qz might have components in spin(16)C and in particular of type
(c).

The real holonomy that is generated by Qz is in the curvature

RQ

xy = ∂xQy − ∂yQx + [Qx, Qy]

(88)

that is on the left-hand side of (83). However, by using the right-hand side of (83), we
can show that RQ
xy does not have any components in the directions generated by the real
stabilizer of Pz in spin(16). Indeed, for q ∈ spin(16) such that q · Pz = 0, we have

η(q, [P¯z , Pz]) = 2 hPz, q · Pzi = 0 ,

(89)

where the ﬁrst equality is due to the deﬁnition in (38). By using the expressions in the
appendix B and (38), we may ultimately show that RQ
xy only has components in L1 and L2:

RQ

xy =(cid:0)|b|2 − |a|2(cid:1) L1 +(cid:0)|a|2 + |b|2(cid:1) L2 .

However, the assumption (72) further assumes that the same is true for Qz. That is, our
problem is to show, if possible, that (90) implies (72).

Let us assume for simplicity that Qz does not contain any elements of type (c),

We may show that the L1 and L2 commute with u(1)3 ⊕ su(4). We may further assert that

Qz ∈ Γ(cid:16)C2 hL1, L2i ⊕(cid:0)u(1)3 ⊕ su(4)(cid:1)C(cid:17) .
the preimage of (cid:0)u(1)3 ⊕ su(4)(cid:1)C under the Lie bracket does not contain any L1 ∧ (−) or
L2 ∧ (−) components. If we then restrict Qz to(cid:0)u(1)3 ⊕ su(4)(cid:1)C ,

(91)

(92)

we ﬁnd that the curvature R

xy = ∂xeQy − ∂yeQx + [eQx,eQy] ,

eQ
xy = 0, due to (90) and the fact that the L1, L2 components in Qz are

= 0 .

(94)

If the space is simply connected, or we restrict to a simply-connected patch, there is a local

u(1)3 ⊕ su(4) gauge transformation that brings eQz = 0. Since this gauge transformation

leaves L1 and L2 invariant, we are led to the Ansatz

Qz = q1 L1 + q2 L2

again, as a solution to (82), (83) and (91). The assumption (72) essentially assumes that
there are no elements of type (c) in Qz and any way to relax the assumption necessarily
involves including such elements in Qz. We leave it as an open question whether this is
possible.

7. 3⁄16-BPS Solutions

In this section we show that if we assume 3 complex Killing spinors that preserve 6 real
supersymmetry out of 32, then the solution necessarily preserves a quarter of supersymme-
try as in section §5. The element P 0
z that was deﬁned in (53) is a complex odd-degree form
in the exterior algebra of

W = R5 h˜e4, ˜e5, ˜e6, ˜e7, ˜e8i ⊂ U .

(96)
The complex chiral spin representation of Spin(10) is the complex representation ∆10 ∼=
ΛoddW C ∼= C16 and P 0
z is a complex chiral spinor of Spin(10). Note that in signature (10, 0),
one cannot impose a reality condition on chiral spinors, only Majoranna and (complex) Weyl
spinors exist similarly to four-dimensional Minkowski space.

The classiﬁcation of spinors in ∆10 under the action of Spin(10) is described in [4]. There
is a locally real two-dimensional orbit space O that is parametrized by a quadratic and a
quartic on ∆10. A spinor P 0
z that is a representative of a generic orbit in O has stability
subgroup SU(4) in Spin(10). At critical points of O, the stability is enhanced to either
SU(5) or Spin(7). In order to ﬁnd the ﬁxed form of a generic P 0
z with stability SU(4) we
choose ˜e4 ∈ ΛoddW C whose stability SU(4) ⊂ Spin(10) is the same group we described in
(68). That is, SU(4) acts only on ˜e5, . . . ˜e8. We may then decompose

ΛoddW C SU(4)

= C h˜e4i ⊕ C h˜e4 ∧ ˜e5 ∧ ˜e6 ∧ ˜e7 ∧ ˜e8i ⊕ C4 ⊕± 2Λ2

±

C4 .

(97)

The C4 are complex one-forms with no component along ˜e4 and the two Λ2
±W C are complex
three-forms with either one or no components along ˜e4, and with (anti-)self-duality with
respect to SU(4) suitably imposed. We then identify the SU(4)-invariant subspace in which
Pz belongs. This way, we assert that the generic P 0

z is ﬁxed to be

P 0

z = a ˜e4 + b ˜e4 ∧ ˜e5 ∧ ˜e6 ∧ ˜e7 ∧ ˜e8 .

(98)

The constants a, b can be ﬁxed to be real by using, for instance, the U (1) × U (1) that is
generated by e4 ∧ e12 and e5 ∧ e13, see (109c) in the appendix.

Let us elaborate on the enhancement of the stabilizer. If a = 0 or b = 0, then the stability
is enhanced to SU(5) ⊂ Spin(10). In the ﬁrst case, a = 0, we simply deﬁne SU(5) ⊂ Spin(10)
analogously to what we did for SU(4) in (68), and which clearly preserves the volume form
˜e4 ∧ ˜e5 ∧ ˜e6 ∧ ˜e7 ∧ ˜e8 and hence the special P 0
z . In the second case, b = 0, we may add to
the generators of SU(4) the elements

e4 ∧ ei+8 − ei ∧ e12 ,
e4 ∧ ei − e12 ∧ ei+8 ,
e4 ∧ e12 + e5 ∧ e13 ,

(99)
(100)
(101)

for i = 5, 6, 7, 8. It is easy to show that they annihilate ˜e4, see (109) for how these act,
and so they also annihilate the special P 0
If |a| = |b|, then the stability is enhanced
z .
to Spin(7)+ ⊂ Spin(8) ⊂ Spin(10), where Spin(7)+ leaves invariant 1 + ˜e5 ∧ . . . ˜e8 as we
described in section §5.

16

GEORGE MOUTSOPOULOS

In any case, it is clear that if Pz admits three complex supersymmetries. that is

− i ei · ei+8 · Pz = Pz ,

i = 1, 2, 3 ,

then it can be brought to the form

Pz = ˜e1 ∧ ˜e2 ∧ ˜e3 ∧ (a ˜e4 + b ˜e4 ∧ ˜e5 ∧ ˜e6 ∧ ˜e7 ∧ ˜e8) .

But then it also satisﬁes the projection condition

− i e4 · e12 · Pz = (−1 + 2˜e4 ∧ i˜e4) Pz = Pz .

(102)

(103)

(104)

Since the projection conditions are equivalent to the dilatino Killing spinor equation, which
is in turn suﬃcient for supersymmetry because the gravitino Killing spinor is integrable on-
shell, we conclude that 3/16-susy solutions preserve at least four complex supersymmetries.

8. Conclusion

In this note we showed how the Liouville ﬁeld equations arise naturally for quarter-BPS
solutions. The Ansatz that leads to the Liouville ﬁelds is on its own a small interesting
result because it yields a large class of solutions whose properties are amenable for analysis.
We also showed that 3/16-BPS solutions are necessarily 1/4-BPS. This reproduces a result
that stems from the classiﬁcation of [3], that the timelike supersymmetric solutions can
only preserve a fraction of 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, or 1/16 supersymmetries. In our case, setting
a or b to zero enhances the supersymmetry from 1/4 to 1/2. Setting a = b, upon which
the real stabilizer su(4) enhances to spin(7), should also be interesting but was not studied
further.

It is natural to look for generalizations of our solutions. There are two directions one may
take. The ﬁrst involves studying solutions that preserve less that 3/16-BPS solutions. The
diﬃculty of this direction is that we know less about the Spin(16 − 2 × 2)-orbits of spinors,
which is required if we are to repeat our method. Ideally, one would like to characterize
all timelike supersymmetric solutions, i.e. preserving at least one timelike supersymmetry,
which requires the classiﬁcation of Spin(16 − 2 × 1) spinors. The second direction is to
try and see whether the Ansatz (72) can be generalized or relaxed, a point on which we
commented a bit in section §6.

Appendix A. Linearity of Timelike Killing Spinors

Assume n Killing spinors ǫi

z, i = 1, . . . n, that are C-linearly independent. We may bring
them to the form of (40) by SO(16) rotations. First we rotate ǫ1
z so that the real and
imaginary part span the directions e1 and e9. Because it is complex null, it has to be of
the form in (40):

ǫ1
z = N11 (e1 + ie9) .

z using the stabilizer SO(16 − 2) of ǫ1

Then rotate ǫ2
span the directions e1, e2, e9 and e10. Because ǫ2
coeﬃcients of ǫ2

z have to be related as in (40),

z so that the real and imaginary part
z and null itself, the

z is orthogonal to ǫ1

(106)
We proceed analogously for the rest, the k-th spinor has to be null along ei + iei+8, i ≤ k,
and so

ǫ2
z = N21 (e1 + ie9) + N22 (e2 + ie10) .

Nki (ei + iei+8) .

(107)

ǫk
z =

kXi=1

k−1Xi=1

At this point, we have assumed that Nii 6= 0 in our iteration.

We will prove now that in (107), the diagonal coeﬃcient Nkk cannot be zero. Assume
there is a coeﬃcient Nkk = 0, for some k > 1, and Nii 6= 0 for all i < k. Then clearly the
k-th spinor ǫi

z is C(M )-linearly dependent on the (k − 1) spinors ǫi

z, i < k,

ǫk
z =

ci(z, ¯z)ǫi

z .

(108)

But since the ǫi
z, i < k, are C(M )-linearly independent, by taking the gravitino Killing
spinor equations and using the Leibniz identity, we may show that the ci are constants.
The k-th Killing spinor is thus C-linearly dependent on its predecessors.

Appendix B. Spinor Basis

Elements of the spin algebra in the Cliﬀord representation (44) appear often in the

following combinations

ei ∧ ej + ei+8 ∧ ej+8 = −8˜e[i ∧ i˜ej] ,

ei ∧ ej − ei+8 ∧ ej+8 = 4(cid:0)˜ei ∧ ˜ej + i˜eii˜ej(cid:1) ,
ei ∧ ej+8 + ej ∧ ei+8 = 4i(cid:16)−δij + 2˜e(i ∧ i˜ej)(cid:17) ,
ei ∧ ej+8 − ej ∧ ei+8 = 4i(cid:0)˜ei ∧ ˜ej − i˜eii˜ej(cid:1) .

Note that in these equalities we use the convention that

On the other hand, the spin representation is minus one quarter the Cliﬀord action, see (6).
This one quarter is included on the right-hand side of (67), (68) and (71).
