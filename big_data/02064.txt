ON THE INTEGRAL D’ALEMBERT’S AND WILSON’S

FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS

BOUIKHALENE BELAID AND ELQORACHI ELHOUCIEN

Abstract. Let G be a locally compact group, and let K be a compact sub-
group of G. Let µ : G −→ C\{0} be a character of G. In this paper, we deal
with the integral equations

Wµ(K) : ZK

f (xkyk−1)dk + µ(y)ZK

f (xky−1k−1)dk = 2f (x)g(y),

and

Dµ(K) : ZK

f (xkyk−1)dk + µ(y)ZK

f (xky−1k−1)dk = 2f (x)f (y)

for all x, y ∈ G where f, g : G −→ C, to be determined, are complex continuous
functions on G. When K ⊂ Z(G), the center of G, Dµ(K) reduces to the new
version of d’Almbert’s functional equation f (xy) + µ(y)f (xy−1) = 2f (x)f (y),
recently studied by Davison [18] and Stetkær [35]. We derive the following link
between the solutions of Wµ(K) and Dµ(K) in the following way : If (f, g) is

a solution of equation Wµ(K) such that CK f = RK f (kxk−1)dωK (k) 6= 0 then

g is a solution of Dµ(K). This result is used to establish the superstability
problem of Wµ(K). In the case where (G, K) is a central pair, we show that
the solutions are expressed by means of K-spherical functions and related
functions. Also we give explicit formulas of solutions of Dµ(K) in terms of
irreducible representations of G. These formulas generalize Euler’s formula
cos(x) = e

on G = R.

1. Introduction and Preliminaries

1.1. Throughout this paper, G will be a locally compact group, K be a compact
subgroup of G and dk the normalized Haar measure of the compact group K. The
unit element of G is denoted by e. The center of G is dented by Z(G). For any
function f on G we deﬁne the function ˇf (x) = f (x−1) for any x ∈ G. The space
of all complex continuous functions on G having compact support is designed by
K(G). We denote by C(G) the space of all complex continuous functions on G. For
each ﬁxed x ∈ G, we deﬁne the left translation operator by (Lxf )(y) = f (x−1y) for
all y ∈ G.
For a given character µ : G −→ C\{0} we consider the following integral equation

(1.1)

ZK

f (xkyk−1)dk + µ(y)ZK

f (xky−1k−1)dk = 2f (x)g(y), x, y ∈ G.

This equation is a generalization of the following functional equations :

(1.2)

ZK

f (xkyk−1)dk + µ(y)ZK

f (xky−1k−1)dk = 2f (x)f (y), x, y ∈ G,

which was studied in [7] when µ = 1 and (G, K) is a central pair.
If K ⊂ Z(G) the subgroup center of G and f = g, (1.1) becomes d’Alembert’s

B. BOUIKHALENE AND E. ELQORACHI

functional equation

(1.3)

f (xy) + µ(y)f (xy−1) = 2f (x)f (y), x, y ∈ G.

In the case where µ = 1, many authors studied the functional equation (1.3) (see
[3], [15], [16], [17], [26], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [49]).
When f (kxh) = f (x) for any x ∈ G and k, h ∈ K, we obtain the functional equation

(1.4)

ZK

f (xky)dk + ZK

f (xky−1)dk = 2f (x)g(y), x, y ∈ G.

If K ⊂ Z(G), (1.1) reduces to the following version of Wilson’s functional equation

(1.5)

f (xy) + µ(y)f (xy−1) = 2f (x)g(y), x, y ∈ G.

IF K ⊂ Z(G) and µ = 1, (1.1) becomes the Wilson’s functional equation

(1.6)

f (xy) + f (xy−1) = 2f (x)g(y), x, y ∈ G.

If f (xk) = χ(k)f (x), where x ∈ G, k ∈ K and χ is a unitary character of K we
obtain the functional equation

(1.7)

ZK

f (xky)χ(k)k + µ(y)ZK

f (xky−1)χ(k)dk = 2f (x)g(y), x, y ∈ G.

If G is compact we can take K = G and consider the functional equation

(1.8)

ZG

f (xtyt−1)dt + µ(y)ZG

f (xty−1t−1)dt = 2f (x)f (y), x, y ∈ G.

The equations (1.4), (1.7) and (1.8) were studied in [1], [7], [9], [10] and [21]. The
functional equation (1.6) appeared in several works by H. Stetkær, see for example
[31], [32] and [33]. For equation (1.3), we refer to the recent studies by Davison [18]
and Stetkær [36].

1.2. Recall on the central pairs. For a function f on G, we say that the function
f is K-central if f (kx) = f (xk) for all k ∈ K and for all x ∈ G. We put KK(G) =
{f ∈ K(G) : f (kx) = f (xk), x ∈ G, k ∈ K}. Under convolution, denoted ⋆, KK (G)
is a subalgebra of the algebra K(G). We recall (see [7]) that the pair (G, K) is said
to be a central pair if the algebra (KK(G), ⋆) is commutative.
A non-zero continuous function ϕ on G is called K-spherical function, if

(1.9)

ZK

ϕ(xkyk−1)dk = ϕ(x)ϕ(y), x, y ∈ G.

for all x, y ∈ G. We will say that a function f ∈ C(G) satisfying

(1.10)

ZK

f (xkyk−1)dk = f (x)ϕ(y) + f (y)ϕ(x), x, y ∈ G.

is associated with the K-spherical function ϕ. Let CK : C(G) −→ C(G) be the
operator given by

(CK f )(x) = ZK

f (kxk−1)dk, x ∈ G.

By easy computations we show that f is K-central if and only if CK f = f . For
more results on the operator CK we refer to [7, Propositions 2.1, Proposition 2.2].
We say that f ∈ C(G) satisﬁes the Kannappan type condition if

ZK ZK

f (zkxk−1hyh−1)dkdh = ZK ZK

f (zkyk−1hxh−1)dkdh, x, y ∈ G (∗)

ON THE INTEGRAL FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS

When K ⊂ Z(G), (∗) reduces to Kannappan condition f (xyz) = f (yxz) for all
x, y, z ∈ G (see [27]).
The results of the present paper are organised as follows : In section 2 we establish
relationship between functional equation (1.1) and (1.2). In Theorem 2.3 we show
that if (f, g) is a solution of (1.1) such that f 6= 0 and CK f 6= 0, without the
assumption that f satisﬁes (*), then g is a solution of (1.2). In section 4 we show
that if (G, K) is a central pair and f is a solution of (1.2), then f has the form
f = ϕ+µ ˇϕ
where ϕ is a K-spherical function. Furthermore we give a complete
description of the solutions of equations of (1.1) and (1.2) in the case where (G, K)
is a central pair. The solutions are expressed by means of K-spherical functions
and solutions of the functional equation

(1.11)

ZK

f (xkyk−1)dk = f (x)ϕ(y) + f (y)ϕ(x), x, y ∈ G

in which ϕ is a K-spherical function. In Corollaries 4.3 and 4.4 we give explicit
formulas of solutions of (1.2) and (1.8) in terms of irreducible representations of
G. Theses formulas generalize Euler’s formula cos(x) = eix+e−ix
on G = R. In the
last section we study stability [48] and Baker’s superstability (see [5] and [6]) of
the functional equations (1.1), (1.2), (1.3), (1.4), (1.5), (1.6) and (1.7). For more
information concerning the stability problem we refer to [3], [5], [6], [11], [12], [22],
[40],[41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47] and [48]. The results of the last sections
generalize the ones obtained in [12] and [21].

2. General properties of equations Wµ(K)

In this section we deal with the integral Wilson’s functional equation (1.1) on a
locally compact group G. We prove, without the assumption that f satisﬁes (*),
that if (f, g) is a solution of Wilson’s functional equation (1.1) then g is a solution
of d’Alembert’s functional equation (1.2).

For later use we need the following proposition

Proposition 2.1. Let G be a locally compact group. Let µ : G −→ C\{0} be a
continuous character of G and let ϕ ∈ C(G) be a K-spherical function. Then
i) µϕ is a K-spherical function.
ii) ϕ+µ ˇϕ
is a solution of (1.2).
iii) Assuming (f, g) is a solution of (1.1) we have : (1) the pair (Lxf, g) for all
x ∈ G is a solution of (1.1), and (2) the pair (CK f, g) is a solution of (1.1).

Proof. We get i) and ii) by easy computations
iii) Let x ∈ G. For all y, z ∈ G we have

Proposition 2.2. Let G be a locally compact group. Let µ : G −→ C\{0} be a
character of G and let f, g ∈ C(G) such that f 6= 0 be a solution of (1.1). Then
i) g is K-central.
ii) g(x) = µ(x)g(x−1) for all x ∈ G.
iii) If f is K-central with f (e) = 0, then f (x) = −µ(x)f (x−1) for all x ∈ G.
iv) g(e) = 1.

(cid:3)

Proof. i) by easy computations.
ii) let a ∈ G such that f (a) 6= 0, then for any y ∈ G we have

(2.1)

ZK

f (aky−1k−1)dk + µ(y−1)ZK

f (akyk−1)dk = 2f (a)g(y−1).

Multiplying (2.1) by µ(y) and using the fact that µ(yy−1) = 1 we get for all y ∈ G

2f (a)µ(y)g(y−1) = ZK

f (akyk−1)k + µ(y)ZK

f (aky−1k−1)dk

= 2f (a)g(y)

which implies that g(y) = µ(y)g(y−1) for any y ∈ G.
iii) since f is a solution of (1.1) we get by setting x = e in (1.1) that

ZK

f (kyk−1)dk + µ(y)ZK

f (ky−1k−1)dk = 2f (e)g(y).

Since f is K-central and f (e) = 0 we get for all y ∈ G that f (y) + µ(y)f (y−1) = 0.
By easy computations we get the remainder.
(cid:3)

The next theorem is the main result of this section. We establish a relation
between Wilson’s functional equation (1.1) and d’Alembert’s functional equation
(1.2) on a locally compact group G, without the assumption that f satisﬁes (∗).

Theorem 2.3. Let G be a locally compact group. Let f, g ∈ C(G) be a solution
of Wilson’s functional equation (1.1) such that CK f 6= 0. Then g is a solution of
d’Alembert’s functional equation (1.2).

Proof. By getting ideas from [13] and [36], and [19] we discuss the following possi-
bilities :
The ﬁrst possibility is f (x) = −µ(x)f (x−1) for all x ∈ G. We let x ∈ G and we put

Φx(y) = ZK

g(xkyk−1)dk + µ(y)ZK

g(y−1kxk−1)dk − 2g(x)g(y), y ∈ G.

According to Proposition 2.1 and the fact that (f, g) is a solution of (1.1) we get
for any x, y, z ∈ G that

Then for any x ∈ G we have

0.

(2.2)

f (z)Φx(y) + f (y)Φx(z) = 0, x, y ∈ G.

Since f 6= 0, then there exists a ∈ G such that f (a) = 0. According to (2.2) we get
that f (a)Φx(y) + f (y)Φx(a) = 0 and then Φx(y) = − Φx(a)
f (a) f (y) = cxf (y) for any
y ∈ G. By setting y = a in (2.2) we get that cxf (a)2 = 0. This implies that cx = 0
and then Φx = 0 for any x ∈ G. According to Proposition 2.2 we get we get by
using the fact that Φx(y) = 0 for any x, y ∈ G that

2g(x)g(y) = ZK

g(xkyk−1)dk + µ(y)ZK

g(y−1xkxk−1)dk

= µ(x)µ(y)ZK
= µ(y)[ZK

g(y−1kx−1k−1)dk + µ(y)ZK

g(y−1kxk−1)dk

g(y−1kxk−1)dk + µ(x)ZK

g(y−1kx−1k−1)dk].

This implies that

ZK

g(y−1kxk−1)dk + µ(x)ZK

g(y−1kx−1k−1)dk = 2g(x)µ(y−1)g(y) = 2g(y−1)g(x).

This completes the proof in the ﬁrst possibility.
Now we ﬁx g and we consider

Wg = {f ∈ C(G) : f is K − central, satisﬁes (1.1) and f (e) = 0}.

If Wg 6= {0}, then by using the above computations we get the desired result,
so we may assume Wg = {0}. Let f ∈ C(G) \ {0} be a solution of (1.1) such
that CK f 6= 0. According to Proposition 2.1 it follows that CK f is a solution
of (1.1). Since Wg = {0} and CK(CK f ) = CK f then CK f (e) = f (e) 6= 0. Re-
placing CK f by CK f
CK f (e) , we may assume that CK f (e) = 1. Let h be a solution
of (1.1), then CK h − (CK h)(e)CK f ∈ Wg = {0}. So CK h = (CK h)(e)CK f .
According to Proposition 2.1 we have for any x ∈ G that CK (Lx−1CK f )(y) =

CK(Lx−1 CK f ). So that CK(Lx−1 CK f ) = CK(Lx−1 CK f )(e)CK f = CK f (x)CK f .

RK f (xkyk−1)dk for any y ∈ G is a solution of (1.1) and that CK (CK(Lx−1 CK f )) =
Then RK CK f (xkyk−1)dk = CK(Lx−1 CK f )(y) = CK f (x)CK f (y), which show that

ON THE INTEGRAL FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS

CK f is a K-spherical function i.e. RK CK f (xkyk−1)dk = CK f (x)CK f (y) for all

x, y ∈ G. Substituting this result into

ZK

CK f (xkyk−1)dk + µ(y)ZK
we get g(y) = CK f (y)+µ(y)CK f (y−1)
satisﬁes equation (2.1). This ﬁnishes the proof of theorem.

CK f (xky−1k−1)dk = 2CK f (x)g(y), x, y ∈ G

. According to Proposition 2.1 ii) we get that g

3. Study of integral Wilson’s functional equation Wµ(K) on a

central pair

Let f : G −→ C. For x ∈ G we deﬁne

(3.1)

fx(y) = ZK

f (xkyk−1)dk − f (x)f (y), y ∈ G.

When f is K-spherical, then fx ≡ 0. A generalized symmetrized sine addition law
is given by

(3.2)

ZK

ω(xkyk−1)dk + ZK

ω(ykxk−1)dk = 2ω(x)f (y) + 2ω(y)f (x), x, y ∈ G

For later use we need the following results :

Proposition 3.1. ([7]) Let (G, K) be a central pair and let f ∈ C(G). Then we
have
i) f satisﬁes the Kannappan type condition (∗).
ii) If f is K-central, then

ZK

f (xkyk−1)dk = ZK

f (ykxk−1)dk, x, y ∈ G.

As an immediate consequence we get the following corollary

Corollary 3.2. Let (G, K) be a central pair and let ω ∈ C(G). If ω is K-central
then (3.2) reduces to the generalized sine addition formula

(3.3)

ZK

ω(xkyk−1)dk = ω(x)f (y) + ω(y)f (x), x, y ∈ G.

Proposition 3.3. Let f ∈ C \ {0} be a solution of the functional equation (1.2).
Then
i) f (e) = 1,
ii) f is K-central,
iii) f (x) = µ(x)f (x−1) for all x ∈ G,
iv)

ZK

f (xkyk−1)dk = ZK

f (ykxk−1)dk, x, y ∈ G.

v) For any x ∈ G, (fx, f ) is a solution of (3.2).

Proof. i) By setting y = e in (1.2) and by using the fact that f 6= 0 we get that
f (e) = 1.

f (xhy−1h−1)dh

= 2f (x)f (y).

So that f (y) = RK f (kyk−1)dk for all y ∈ G, from which we get that f is K-central.

iii) Since f is K-central we get by putting x = e in (1.2) that f (y) + µ(y)f (y−1) =
2f (y) for all y ∈ G. Hence f (y) = µ(y)f (y−1) for all y ∈ G.
iv) In view of iii) we have for all x, y ∈ G that

So that we get RK f (ykxk−1)dk = RK f (xkyk−1)dk for all x, y ∈ G.

fx(zkyk−1)dk = 2fx(y)f (z) + 2fx(z)f (y).

Hence for all x ∈ G, the pair (fx, f ) is a solution of (3.2).

f (xkyk−1)dk = f (x)g(y) + g(x)f (y), x, y ∈ G.

Then one of the following statements hold
i) f = 0 and g arbitrary in C(G).

iv) g is a K-spherical function and f is associated to g.

Proof. The proof is similar to one used in [20].

4. Solution of equation Wµ(K) on a central pair

In this section we obtain solution of equation (1.1) in the case where (G, K) is a

central pair.

In the next theorem we solve the functional equation (1.2). We will adapt the
method used in [35].

Theorem 4.1. Let (G, K) be a central pair. Let µ : G −→ C∗ be a character on G
and let f : G −→ C be a non-zero solution of the functional equation (2.1). Then
there exists a K-spherical function ϕ : G −→ C such that f = ϕ+µ ˇϕ

.

2

Proof. By using 5i) in Proposition 3.3 we get for all x ∈ G that the pair (fx, f ) is
a solution of (3.2).
First case : There exists x ∈ G such that fx 6= 0. According to iii) in Theorem 3.4,
there exist two K-spherical functions ϕ and ψ such that ϕ 6= ψ and that f = ϕ+ψ
2 .
By substituting this in (1.2) we get for all x, y ∈ G that

ϕ(x)[µ(y)ϕ(y−1) − ψ(y)] + ψ(x)[µ(y)ψ(y−1) − ϕ(y)] = 0.

Since ϕ 6= ψ, according to [19] we get that ϕ and ψ are linearly independent. Hence
ψ(y) = µ(y)ϕ(y−1) for any y ∈ G.
By iv) of Theorem 3.4 we get by a small computation the desired result.
Second case :
all x, y ∈ G. Then by subsisting f in (1.2) we get that f (x) = µ(x)f (x−1) for all
x ∈ G. Hence f = ϕ = ϕ+µ ˇϕ
(cid:3)

if fx = 0, for all x ∈ G then RK f (xkyk−1)dωK(k) = f (x)f (y) for

2 where ϕ is K-spherical function.

In the next theorem we solve the functional equation (1.1).

Theorem 4.2. Let (G, K) be a central pair. If (f, g) is a solution of (1.1) such
that CK f 6= 0, then there exists a K-spherical function ϕ such that
1)

g =

ϕ + µ ˇϕ

2

.

2)
i) When ϕ 6= µ ˇϕ, then there exist α, β ∈ C such that

f = α

ϕ + µ ˇϕ

2

+ β

ϕ − µ ˇϕ

2

.

ii) When ϕ = µ ˇϕ, then f = αϕ + l where α ∈ C and l is a solution of the functional
equation

(4.1)

ZK

l(xkyk−1)dk = l(x)ϕ(y) + ϕ(x)l(y), x, y ∈ G.

Proof. Let f, g ∈ C(G) \ {0} be a solution of (1.2), then by Theorem 2.3 we get
that g is a solution of (1.2). According to Theorem 4.1 there exists a K-spherical

function such that g(x) = ϕ(x)+µ(x)ϕ(x−1)
following way we get for any x ∈ G that

2

for any x ∈ G. By decomposing f in the

f (x) =

f (x) + µ(x)f (x−1)

2

+

f (x) − µ(x)f (x−1)

2

= f1(x) + f2(x)

where f1(x) = f (x)+µ(x)f (x−1)
for all x ∈ G. By easy
computations we get that f1(x) = µ(x)f1(x−1) and f2(x) = −µ(x)f2(x−1) for all
x ∈ G. By using the fact that RK f (xkyk−1)dk = RK f (ykxk−1)dk for all x, y ∈ G

and f2(x) = f (x)−µ(x)f (x−1)

we get that

2

2

(4.2)

ZK

f1(xkyk−1)dk + µ(y)ZK

f1(xky−1k−1)dk = 2f1(x)g(y), x, y ∈ G.

By setting x = e in (4.3) we get that f1(y) = f1(e)g(y) = αg(y) for any y ∈ G.
On the other hand by small computations we show that f2 is a solution of the
functional equation

(4.3)

ZK

f2(xkyk−1)dk = f2(x)g(y) + f2(y)g(x), x, y ∈ G.

According to iii) and iv) in Theorem 3.4 we get the remainder.

(cid:3)

In the next corollary we use R. Godement’s spherical functions theory [27] to give
explicit formulas in terms of irreducible representations of G : Let (π, H) be a com-
pletely irreducible representation of G, δ be an irreducible representation of K and
χδ the normalized character of δ. The set of vectors in H which under k −→ π(k)

transform according to δ is denoted by Hδ. The operator E(δ) = RK π(k)χδ(k)dk

is a continuous projection of H onto Hδ.

We will say that a function f is quasi-bounded if there exists a semi-norm ρ(x)
|f (x)|
such that supx∈G
ρ(x) < +∞ (see [27]). According to [7, Theorem 4.1, Theorem
6.2] we have the following corollary

Corollary 4.3. Let (G, K) be a central pair. Let f be a non-zero quasi-bounded
continuous function on G satisfying χδ ⋆ f = f . Then f is a solution of (1.2) if and
only if there exists a completely irreducible representation (π, H) of G such that

f (x) =

1

2dim(δ)

(tr(E(δ)π(x)) + µ(x)tr(E(δ)π(x−1)), x ∈ G

where tr is the trace on H and dim(δ) is the dimension of δ.

In the next corollary we assume that G is a compact. Then (G, G) is a central

pair (see [7] and [9]).

Corollary 4.4. Let G be a compact group and let f be a continuous function on G.
Then f is is a solution of (1.8) if and only if there exists a continuous irreducible
representation (π, H) such that

f (x) =

χπ(x) + µ(x)χπ(x−1)

2d(π)

, x ∈ G

where χπ and d(π) are respectively the character and the dimension of π.

5. Superstablity of Wµ(K) on a locally compact group

In this section, by using Theorem 2.4, we study the superstability problem of

equations Wµ(K) and Dµ(K) on non abelian case

Lemma 5.1. Let δ > 0. Let µ : G −→ C be a unitary character of G.
f, g ∈ C(G) such that f is unbounded and (f, g) is a solution of the inequality

let

(5.1)

|ZK

f (xkyk−1)dωK(k) + µ(y)ZK

f (xky−1k−1)dk − 2f (x)g(y)| ≤ δ, x, y ∈ G.

Then
i) For all x ∈ G, (CK (Lx−1 f ), g) is a solution of the inequality (5.1).
ii) g(y) = µ(y)g(y−1) for all y ∈ G.
iii) g is K central.

Proof. i) and iii) by easy computation.
ii) Since (f, g) is a solution of (5.1), then we get for any x, y ∈ G

|ZK

f (xkyk−1)dk + µ(y)ZK

f (xky−1k−1)dk − 2f (x)g(y)| ≤ δ

and

|ZK

f (xky−1k−1)dk + µ(y−1)ZK

f (xkyk−1)dk − 2f (x)g(y−1)| ≤ δ.

By multiplying the last inequality by µ(y) we get that

|µ(y)ZK

f (xky−1k−1)dk + ZK

By triangle inequality we get

f (xkyk−1)dk − 2f (x)µ(y)g(y−1)| ≤ δ.

|2f (x)||g(y) − µ(y)g(y−1)| ≤ 2δ

for all y ∈ G. Since f is unbounded we get that g(y) = µ(y)g(y−1) for all y ∈ G. (cid:3)

Lemma 5.2. Let δ > 0. Let µ : G −→ C∗ be a unitary character of G. Let
f, g ∈ C(G) such that g is unbounded solution of inequality (5.1). Then g is a
solution of d’Alembert’s functional equation (1.2).

Proof. By using the same method as in [14, Corollary 2.7 iii] we get that g is a
solution of (1.2)
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.3. Let δ > 0. Let µ : G −→ C∗ be a unitary character of G. Let
f, g ∈ C(G) such that f is unbounded solution of inequality (5.1) and that the
function x −→ f (x) + µ(x)f (x−1) is bounded and CK f 6= 0. Then g is a solution
of d’Alembert’s functional equation (1.2).

Proof. First case: g is bounded. Let

ψ(x, y) = ZK

g(xkyk−1)dk + µ(y)ZK

g(y−1kxk−1)dk − 2g(x)g(y), x, y ∈ G.

Then according to the proof of Theorem 2.4 we get for all x, y, z ∈ G that

2f (z)ψ(x, y) + 2f (y)ψ(x, z) = 2g(x)[ZK

f (zkyk−1)dk + ZK

Since the function x −→ f (x) + µ(x)f (x−1) is bounded, then there exists β > 0
such that |f (x) + µ(x)f (x−1)| ≤ β for all x ∈ G. So that we get for any x, y, z ∈ G
that

(5.2)

|2f (z)ψ(x, y) + 2f (y)ψ(x, z)| ≤ 2β(1 + |g(x)|).

Since f is unbounded, then there exists a sequence (zn)n∈N such that limn−→∞ |f (zn)| =
+∞. By using the inequality (5.2), it follows that there exists cx ∈ C such that
ψ(x, y) = cxf (y) for all x, y ∈ G. So that the function (x, y, z) −→ 2f (z)cxf (y) +
2f (y)cxf (z) is bounded. Since f is unbounded it follows that cx = 0 for all x ∈ G.
As in the proof of Theorem 2.4, we get that g is a solution of functional equation
(1.2).
Second case: g is unbounded. According to lemma 5.2 we get that g is a solution
of (1.2).
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.4. Let δ > 0. Let µ : G −→ C∗ be a unitary character of G. Let
f, g ∈ C(G) such that f is an unbounded solution of inequality (5.1). Then g is a
solution of d’Alembert’s long functional equation

Since f is bounded we conclude that g is solution of functional equation (5.3). (cid:3)

In the next corollary we assume that K is a discrete subgroup of G

Lemma 5.5. Let δ > 0. Let µ : G −→ C be a unitary character of G. Let
f, g ∈ C(G) such that f is an unbounded K-central solution of the inequality (5.1)
such that CK f 6= 0. Then g is a solution of d’Alembert’s functional equation (1.2).

Proof. Since (f, g) is a solution of the inequality (5.1) we get according to lemma
5.1 that (CK f, g) is also a solution of (5.1). By setting x = e in (5.1) and by the
fact that CK f is K-central it follows that

|CK f (y) + µ(y)CK f (y−1) − 2f (e)g(y)| ≤ δ, y ∈ G.

If f (e) = 0 we get that the function y −→ CK f (y) + µ(y)CK f (y−1) is bounded.
According to Lemma 5.3 we have that g is a solution of d’Alembert’s functional
equation (1.2).
If f (e) 6= 0. Replacing CK f by CK f
f (e) we may assume that f (e) = 1. Consider the
function CK (Laf )(x) = RK f (akxk−1)dωK(k) for all x ∈ G. According to lemma

5.1 we get that (CK(Laf ), g) is a solution of (5.1). Let a ∈ G such that

h = CK(Laf ) − CK(Laf )(e)CK f.

If there exists a ∈ G such that h is unbounded on G. Since h(e) = 0 and CK h = h
and that the function h is a solution of the inequality (5.1) it follows that x −→
h(x) + µ(x)h(x−1) is bounded. According to lemma 5.3 we get that g is a solution
d’Alembert’s functional equation (1.2).
Now assume that h is bounded, that is there exists M (x) > 0 such that

|ZK

f (xkyk−1)dk − f (x)CK f (y)| ≤ M (x)

for all x, y ∈ G. Since f is K-central we get for all x, y ∈ G that

|ZK

f (xkyk−1)dk − f (x)f (y)| ≤ M (x).

By using triangle inequality we get for all x, y, z ∈ G that

|f (z)||ZK

M (xkyk−1)dk + M (x) + |f (x)|M (y)|.

Since f is unbounded it follows that RK f (xkyk−1)dk − f (x)f (y) for all x, y ∈ G.

Substituting this result into inequality (5.1) it follows that

|f (x)||f (y) + µ(y)f (y−1) − 2g(y)| ≤ δ

for all x, y ∈ G. Since f is unbounded we get that g(y) = f (y)+µ(y)f (y−1)
for all
y ∈ G. According to Proposition 2.1 we get that g is a solution of d’Alembert’s
functional equation (1.2).

The next theorem is the main result of this section

Theorem 5.6. Let δ > 0 be ﬁxed, µ be a unitary character of G and let f, g :
G −→ C such that (f, g) satisﬁes (5.1) and f is K-central. Then
1) f, g are bounded or
2) f is unbounded and g satisﬁes d’Alembert’s functional equation (1.2) or
3) g is unbounded and f satisﬁes the functional equation (1.1) (if f 6= 0 such that
CK f 6= 0, then g satisﬁes the d’Alembert’s functional equation (1.2)).

Proof. We get 1) by easy computations.
2) Assume that f is unbounded. According to Lemmas 5.1, 5.3 and 5.5 we get the
proof.
3) Assume that g is unbounded, then for f = 0 the pair (f, g) is a solution of
equation (5.1). Afterward we suppose that f 6= 0. By using (5.1) and the following
