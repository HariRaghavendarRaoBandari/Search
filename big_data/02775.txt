Canonical description of 1D few-body systems with short range interaction

(Dated: March 10, 2016)

We address the fundamental interplay between indistinguishability and interactions when dis-
creteness eﬀects are neglected in systems with strictly ﬁxed number of particles. For this end we
supplement cluster expansions (many-body canonical techniques where quantum statistics is treated
exactly) with short-time/large volume dynamical information where interparticle forces are described
non-perturbatively. This approach, specially suitable for the few-body case where it overcomes the
inappropriate use of virial expansions, can be consistently combined with scaling considerations,
minimal ground-state information and strong coupling expansions in such a way that a single inter-
action event provides most of the thermodynamic and spectral properties of 1D systems with short
range interactions. Our analytical results, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, show
a form of universal integrability of interaction eﬀects for arbitrary conﬁnements.

The description of the physical properties of systems
with many (in general interacting) particles is one of the
most intriguing and at the same time problematic sub-
jects in modern physics. As in most cases no exact solu-
tions can be found one falls back either on full numerical
simulations or on the problem of identifying simple, basic
key features that build up the more complex systems as
a whole and their emergent phenomena. Progress in this
direction can be achieved by the combination of quasi-
particle, mean ﬁeld and perturbative methods, with the
physical picture corresponding to a system of particle-
like excitations evolving under an eﬀective external ﬁeld
and a weak residual interaction [1, 2].

There are basically three reasons for the success of this
approach in the past. First, the previously unsurmount-
able diﬃculty in producing high excited states and the
consequent focus on ground-state properties where the
quasi-particle plus mean-ﬁeld picture is valid. Second,
the natural interest on extreme regimes where a small
parameter can be identiﬁed, thus justifying perturbation
expansions. Third, the macroscopically large number
of particles typically involved, pushing the system into
the limit where well developed grand-canonical methods
could be used instead of the fundamental, but far less
understood, canonical or microcanonical description.

The recent experimental realization of quantum sys-
tems made of few interacting, identical particles [3–5]
and the consequent measurement of their spectral, ther-
modynamical and dynamical properties poses then a the-
oretical challenge: while for realistic few-body systems
the very concept of mean-ﬁeld is problematic, the fun-
damental issue is the lack of analytical tools to describe
the interplay between indistinguishability and interaction
within a strictly number-constraining formalism.

In this paper we ﬁll this gap with a method that pro-
vides analytical results (given by sums over a ﬁnite set of
diagrams) for spectral and thermodynamical properties
of few-body systems where indistinguishability is treated
exactly, interactions are treated non-perturbatively, and
the total number of particles is strictly ﬁxed. At the

heart of our approach lies the fact that the consistent
use of short-time information responsible for the smooth
properties of many-body spectra demands that inter-
action eﬀects are universally given by cluster functions
characteristic of quantum integrable models. We further

show that this consistence must be applied order by order
in the cluster expansion and therefore bounds any extra
physical input like scaling considerations, condensation
eﬀects and fermionization. In this way most thermody-
namic and spectral properties of interacting many-body
systems, being quantum integrable or not, turned out to
be analytical obtained in terms of a single interaction
diagram.

The quality of our approach, the Quantum Cluster Ex-
pansion (QCE), is illustrated in Fig. 1 where we check
our results against expensive numerical calculations of
thermodynamic and spectral properties of a system made
from few interacting bosonic atoms which are harmoni-
cally conﬁned, a 1d many-body system of experimental
relevance. As is clearly seen in Fig. 1a, the failure of
grand canonical approaches to describe the thermody-
namics in this few-body system is not just a practical is-
sue: already in the non-interacting limit, including more
and more terms of the inﬁnite virial expansions [6] does
not reproduce the correct canonical description. On the
contrary, the QCE (here used in its simplest form where
condensation eﬀects due to the discreteness of the ground
state are not included) provides accurate results down to
ultra low temperatures. As shown in Fig. 1b, when inter-
actions are switched on the consistent combination of one
single interaction cluster with scaling and strong coupling
expansions provides analytical results for the many-body
density of states in excellent agreement with numerical
simulations.

The analytical description of few-body systems within
the QCE requires two ingredients. First, all informa-
tion about the discreteness of the many-body spectra is
dropped, or included only to account for condensation
eﬀects. Like in text-book derivations of grand-canonical
potentials for non-interacting systems, this is a standard
assumption justiﬁed by the high level density of many
body systems. Second, interactions will be included only
at the pairwise level, but now in a way that is fully consis-
tent with particle exchange symmetry and, importantly,
with the short time expansion implicit in the smooth con-
tribution to the spectrum.

The technical implementation of these assumptions be-
gins with an exact, ﬁnite cluster expansion [7, 8] of the
quantum propagator K (N ) for N distinguishable but in-
teracting particles which to ﬁrst order reads

proach of [10], Weyl’s method to obtain the smooth

the many-body, interacting case. In the case of N identi-

where Ainter
(n1,n2) is the amplitude of two cycles with n1
and n2 particles involving the interacting part ∆K (2) for
a pair of particles, one of which living in each of the two
cycles (see Fig. 2e). Note that in deﬁnition (7) the cardi-
nality of N may diﬀer from the upper index N , which is
the case in (8) and that c(N−2)
has the meaning of count-
ing the number of permutations of N with two distinct
cycles of length n1 and n2 involving particle 1 and 2 re-
spectively and the remaining N −n1−n2 being composed
of cycles with lengths N. Finally, for the case n1+n2 = N
we consistently deﬁne A{} := 1 and c(N−2)

contribution to Z corresponding to a permutation P ∈

a subset of the particles as large as the cycle-lengths in
the cycle-decomposition of P . Let NP denote the mul-

and we may use N without subscript wherever the as-
signment is clear from context. The contribution to the

teraction term ∆K (2)((qP (k), qP (l)), (qk, ql); t) deﬁned
in (2) (see Fig. 2d).
In the corresponding corrections
to AN, the interaction can link two particles involved in
either the same or in two diﬀerent cycles of P , referred
as intra-cycle- and inter-cycle-contributions respectively.

and its extension for the case with multiple distinguish-
able species in [11].

At the level of general interactions, equation (10) is
the main result of this paper.
It results from the con-
sistent use of short-time dynamical information, in the
spirit of the celebrated Weyl expansion, to obtain ther-
modynamic and spectral properties that are not sensitive
to the discreteness of the many-body spectrum. It is or-
ganized in a way such that all contributions coming from
indistinguishability are included, while interaction takes
place among one pair of particles at the time.

In the following we will show how the QCE can be used
to further provide analytical results in situations where
the explicit calculation of A(n1,n2) is possible. Remark-
ably, this is the case for the broad case of 1D systems
with contact interactions that covers both the integrable
Lieb-Liniger model [12] as well as the non-integrable and
experimentally important case of homogeneous (in par-
ticular harmonic) conﬁnement.
We choose units by setting 2/2m = 1 such that the
thermal wavelength becomes λT = √4πβ. In these units,
the Hamiltonian of the N particle system with coordi-
nates xi is

tial [13], Ainter

For δ-interactions it turns out that Aintra

λT
ing F¯ν (s) into A(n1,n2) in Eq. (14) and using the later
into Eq. (10) we obtain an analytical expression for the
canonical partition function (for speciﬁc applications the
alternative form of (15) given in [11] improves accuracy
in the numerical integration).

Up to this point, we have used the QCE in its sim-
plest form where only one interaction event is taken into
count, valid from vanishing to moderately high inter-
action strength α. The quality of the results is, how-
ever, drastically extended to higher values of α using the
same reduced information by means of a shifting method
based on the following universal scaling of A(n1,n2) with
the (eﬀective) system size, temperature and interaction
strength. The main contribution to the n-fold integrals
in Eq. (4) after pairwise replacement with the interacting
parts ∆K (2) comes from the region where all n particles
are close to each other, implying fast convergence and
allowing us to extend all integrals over relative coordi-
nates to inﬁnity, whereas changes in the center-of-mass
are only subject to the external potential, thus yielding
the (eﬀective) size Veﬀ of the system as prefactor. From
dimensional analysis the scaling behavior with Veﬀ /λd
T
and βα then follows as is discussed to more detail in [11].

4
Remarkably, the scaling with 1/√n reminds of the scal-
ing of a non-interacting cycle (4) and ﬁts to the physical
picture that all particles that are connected by either
symmetry-permutations and/or interaction form a sin-
gle cluster whose internal wavefunction spreads with a
velocity proportional to n.

Since the previous arguments hold also for other di-
mensions (as long as the interaction is “short-ranged” in
the sense above and can be expressed in terms of a single
energy-type parameter α representing its strength) we
expect the universal form

paring its thermodynamical and spectral consequences

FIG. 3. Mechanical equation of state for the three par-
ticle Lieb-Liniger model [12] with thermal coupling βα =
0.01, 0.1, 0.5. Comparison of numerical calculations (sym-
bols) and the analytical QCE (19) combined with minimal
analytic information about the lowest two MB states to ac-
count for condensation eﬀects (22). The system-speciﬁc non-
monotonous behavior comes from the interplay between repul-
sive interactions and quasicondensation in the single-particle
ground state of zero energy, and is perfectly reproduced by
our analytical results.

where the second term between brackets corresponds to
the interacting part and the functions fl can be ex-
pressed through elementary functions in the case of δ-
interaction [11]. Note that (20) shows that the eﬀect of
interactions gets suppressed either when the total energy
E ≫ α or E ≪ α for interaction potentials that vanish
for α → 0 or α → ∞, respectively.
A special feature of 1D systems with contact interac-
tions that is clearly seen in the numerical results is the
apparent mapping linking the limits α → 0 with α → ∞.
This correspondence can be made precise using an exact
boson-fermion duality valid for arbitrary α [15]. Thus, we
can construct the QCE expansion around the strongly in-
teracting regime as an eﬀective spinless fermionic theory,
providing again analytical expressions for the partition
function [11] that perfectly describe the numerical ob-
servations in the corresponding regime of large α.
In
particular, for inﬁnitely strong repulsion, the system be-
haves as a gas of free fermions in the currently relevant
aspects. For harmonic conﬁnement, fermionization is ad-
ditionally reﬂected by the rigid shift ∆E∞ between the
DOS in the two limits. This feature is incorporated by a
suitable generalization/extension of our approach.

Motivated by the general scaling property (20) we pro-

pose the ansatz

∆Eα = χ(E/α)∆E∞

(21)

for the energy shift ∆Eα for ﬁnite interaction strength.
In [11] we show that the universal scaling χ(E/α) is
uniquely obtained from the ﬁrst order QCE itself.
It
interpolates between the diﬀerent regimes for α without
any ﬁtting. The shifting method provides again analyti-
cal results in good agreement with numerical calculations

5

shown in Fig. 1b.

Besides the possibility of including consistently short-
time dynamics into the analytical description given by
the QCE when the later is supplemented with scaling
considerations and fermionization, a ﬁnal point is the
description of condensation phenomena. Here, and simi-
larly to the usual grand canonical approach, within QCE
ultra low temperature eﬀects require that the ground
state is treated separately. Within QCE, this can be
achieved by a consistent method where minimal infor-
mation about the lowest two MB states is combined with
the QCE for non-zero temperatures by the ansatz

Z(β) = e−βE0(Veff ) + e−βE1(Veff )

(22)
which can be analytically matched order by order for
large Veﬀ with (17) to determine the wl functions. With
this minimal modiﬁcation, and using only one interac-
tion event, the corresponding modiﬁcation to (19) shows
again excellent agreement with numerical results for the
Lieb-Liniger model covering a large regime of interactions
and all system sizes (see Fig. 3). Moreover, numerical
simulations require thousands of many-body energy lev-
els to achieve convergence, and therefore are feasible only
because the model at hand is quantum integrable.

Although the QCE exploits the universality of the
smooth part of the many-body density of states, in the
sense of its dependence with a very restricted set of uni-
versal functions together with few geometrical parame-
ters, it can be used to study system speciﬁc eﬀects. This
is again illustrated in Fig. 3 where the non-monotonicity
of the pressure as a function of the system’s length for
three interacting bosons on a ring, a very peculiar con-
sequence of the competition between interactions and
bunching, is fully reproduced by our analytical formu-
las.

In conclusion, we have shown that the consistent use
of short-time/large-volume dynamical information in the
description of interacting 1d few-body systems leads to
the emergence of robust features depending on a very
restricted set of universal functions. In particular, most
spectral and thermodynamical observable properties that
are not sensitive to the discreteness of the spectrum
are resembled by only two-body eﬀects even for non-
integrable models. Our results show that the condition
of integrability is too restrictive when one is not inter-
ested in the precise form of the many-body spectrum but
instead on its smooth part and analytical results can be
found for smooth observables for the, previously consid-
ered intractable, non-integrable cases.

Appendix A: Formal derivation of QCE in

path-integral formulation

section is

This
intended to give analytic support
to Eq. (1) of the main text. To ﬁnd the ﬁrst correction
to the N -body propagator within QCE we start with the
exact path-integral representation of the distinguishable
propagator

Vint(qk(s) − ql(s))ds(cid:21) .

(23)

Analogous to the Mayer functions in the cluster expan-
sion in classical statistical mechanics we deﬁne the Mayer
functionals fkl[q(s)] by

i

Z t

Vint(qk(s) − ql(s))ds(cid:21) .
1 + fkl[q(s)] := exp(cid:20)−
The next step is to expand the product Qk<l over pairs

into a sum and order its terms by the number of Mayer
functionals involved.

(25)

In ﬁrst order QCE we truncate all terms that involve
more than one Mayer functional which physically corre-
sponds to neglecting interaction eﬀects that are aﬀect-
ing more than one pair of particles at a time. Since
fo indistinguishable particles all kinds of symmetry re-
lated cycle-structures are applied afterwards this will still
give non-trivial interaction-induced contributions involv-
ing more than two particles. The ﬁrst summand involving
no Mayer functional gives the non-interacting propaga-
tor whereas the next term is evaluated by factorizing the
path-integral into independent factors and using the two-
body identity

of the two-body propagator K (2). Together with the
N−2 independent path-integrals for the remaining parti-
cles j 6= k, l, which lead to non-interacting single-particle
propagators we obtain Eq. (1) of the main text.

Appendix B: Multiple species

If multiple distinguishable species of particles are in-
volved the full ﬁrst order contribution to the overall par-
tition function reads

∆Z (N1,...,Ns) =

(27)

where N1, . . . , Ns are the numbers of particles in each
of the s species and ǫi = ± reﬂects the exchange sym-
metry within species i. The special case s = 2 of (27)
can be used for calculations on the Gaudin-Yang model.
In the given general form, (27) is valid for arbitrary
short-ranged interactions addressable with the QCE ap-
proach using Eq. (10) of the main text. The interaction-
related two-body information then ﬁnds its way into (27)
through the diagrammatic calculation of Ainter
(n1,n2) and
Aintra
(n1,n2) (see Fig. 2e,f of the Letter) depending on the
interacting part of the propagator of two particles living
in free space and being subject to the speciﬁc interactions
(see Fig. 2d of the Letter).

In the case of δ-interactions

the given expres-
sion Eq. (12) of the main text can be used in (27). Spe-
cial care has to be taken if some of the particle species
are allowed to diﬀer in mass. Then one has to relax the
speciﬁc choice of units 2/(2m) = 1 because of ambiguity
and take care of the correct masses mi in all calculations.
This is done by substituting the corresponding thermal
de-Broglie wavelength λT → λi
T in all expressions involv-
ing only one species i on the one hand. We denote the
modiﬁed quantities with a tilde and ﬁnd the two trivial
substitutions

˜Z0,ǫi = Z0,ǫi|λT→λi
∆ ˜Zǫi = ∆Zǫi|λT→λi

On the other hand, the inter-cycle contributions Ainter

[see Eq. (12) of the main text] between two diﬀerent

species i and j have to be altered by the prescription

The terms in the ﬁrst row of this equation are well be-
haved numerically, since the asymptotics ex2
erfc(x) =
1/(√πx) + O(x−3) for x ≫ 1 are very well known. The

numerical problem now lies in cancellation eﬀects be-
tween the two terms of the second row. To overcome
this, we split the Owen T function

which gets obvious after derivation with respect to s, and
therefore compensates exactly the term erfc(√s) in (37).
From the remaining integral a factor can be extracted to
compensate for the exponential prefactor while keeping
it still bounded. In total one numerically well behaved
form of the function F is

F¯ν(s) = e(1+¯ν 2)sherfc(p(1 + ¯ν2)s) − erfc(¯ν√s)erfc(√s)i

Appendix D: Calculation of QCE contributions

For comparisons with exact or numerically calculated
spectra it is more convenient to use the level counting
dE′ ¯̺(E′) rather than the DOS
¯̺(E). Therefore we will give the explicit expressions for
the ﬁrst order QCE-contributions to the coeﬃcients of
the former. One may write

function ¯N (E) = R E

Naturally, it is also possible to put diﬀerent interaction-
strengths αij between diﬀerent species.

Appendix C: Numerically stable representation

of F¯ν (s)

The integral given in Eq. (15) of the main text is sub-
ject to numerical instability for large values of s. In or-
der to represent the function F¯ν (s) in a form where the
numerical accuracy is not an essential issue, one can par-
tially treat the integral analytically in a way that the
remaining integral gives only small contributions also for
large values of s. To acchieve this we ﬁrst recognize that
F¯ν (s) can be written in terms of Owen’s T -function

T (a, b) =

Calculation of b(l)

First, we remove the exponential prefactor by deﬁning

˜F¯ν(s) := e−(1+¯ν 2)sF¯ν (s) .

(52)

The integral in ˜F¯ν(s) can not be evaluated to elemen-
tary expressions directly. In contrast to that its inverse
Laplace transform can be related to the solvable deriva-
tive given by

Appendix E: QCE in fermionization regime

For arbitrary interaction strengths α a 1D bosonic
system with δ-interaction maps exactly to a spinless
fermionic system with an eﬀective attractive 0-range in-
teraction potential [15] which will here simply be referred
to as the anti-δ-interaction. In order to apply the ﬁrst
order QCE in the eﬀective fermionic theory we need to
derive the two-body propagator for the anti-δ-interaction
which can be completely achieved on an abstract level
relating it back to the propagator in the δ-interacting
system. First, for any two-body propagator K we deﬁne
the swapping operation denoted by ¯K as

¯K((q′1, q′2), (q1, q2))

=(K((q′1, q′2), (q1, q2)),
−K((q′1, q′2), (q1, q2)),

for (q1 − q2)(q′1 − q′2) > 0,
for (q1 − q2)(q′1 − q′2) < 0 ,
(68)

which gives a relative sign inversion when the two parti-
cles have to cross each other along any classical path from
(q1, q2) to (q′1, q′2). Now consider the interacting propa-
gator K of two distinguishable particles subject to the
δ-interaction. It is built from its symmetric part K+ and
its antisymmetric part K− w.r.t. to particle exchange,

K = K+ + K− ,
is
eigenfunctions ψ±(R, r)

deﬁned

where K+(K−)
symmet-
ric(antisymmetric)
of
the
two-body system, where R, r denote center-of-mass and
relative coordinates, respectively.
The δ-interaction
only has an eﬀect on the symmetric wavefunctions

(69)

by

all

11

ψ+(R, r), whereas the antisymmetric ones are unaﬀected
ψ−(R, r) = ψ0,−(R, r), thus we write
K+ = K0,+ + Kα ,
K− = K0,− ,

(71)

(70)

where K0,± denotes the (anti)symmetric part of the non-
interacting propagator and Kα the modiﬁcation to the
symmetric part due to ﬁnite interaction.

For the anti-δ-interaction (which will be denoted by
a tilde) the opposite is the case and one has unaﬀected
symmetric wavefunction ˜ψ+(R, r) = ψ0,+(R, r) whereas
the antisymmetric wavefunctions ˜ψ−(R, r) feel the inter-
action in form of a jump discontinuity at vanishing rel-
ative distance r of the particles. Because of the exact
mapping, those antisymmetric wavefunctions are equiv-
alent with the symmetric ones for the δ-interaction with
a conditional sign-inversion

˜ψ−(R, r) = sign(r)ψ+(R, r) .

(72)

This sign-inversion is then reﬂected in the propagator ˜K
of two distinguishable particles being subject to the anti-
δ-interaction as

˜K = K0,+ + ¯K+

= K0,+ + ¯K0,+ + ¯Kα .

(73)

For ﬁrst order QCE calculations one needs then only
the modiﬁcation ˜Kα of the porpagator due to anti-δ-
interaction, thus we write

˜K = K0 + ˜Kα

= K0,+ + K0,− + ˜Kα ,

and obtain the ﬁnal result

˜Kα = ¯K0,+ + ¯Kα − K0,− .

(74)

(75)

A simple test of this result can be done in the limit
α → ∞ where the symmetric propagator for δ-interaction
becomes just the swapped version of the free antisymmet-
ric propagator

so that

combinations of the mentioned, and maybe other more
exotic constructions. The reason for this exception is
that those potentials intrinsically are given by dimension-
less couplings that cannot be transformed into energy-like
couplings α by means of the available constants. At the
same time this means that such potentials yield scale-
invariant Hamiltonians which need to be regularized to
give them physical meaning. To acchieve that usually the
regularized forms are equipped with a physical parame-
ter of the system that is to be modelled. This parameter
must not be dimensionless and is often given as a bound
state energy or a scattering length. Therefore also those
exceptional cases are in their ﬁnal regularized physically
meaningful versions again admitting the form (82).

Appendix F: Universal Scaling

Generic scaling of spatial potentials

Suppose the system under observation with (in total)
D spatial degrees of freedom is described by a Hamilto-
nian

ˆH = ˆT + V (ˆq) ,

(81)

where ˆT is the kinetic energy and V is a spatial poten-
tial energy that can be an external potential as well as
an interaction potential aﬀecting diﬀerent particle coor-
dinates. Suppose further that the potential V scales with
parameter α of unit energy that represents its strength.
Other dimensionless parameters λ might also be in-
volved. Moreover, two further constants  and a mass
m are allowed to be arguments of the potential. In case
that more than just one mass are entering the Hamilto-
nian (e.g. diﬀerent particle species or anisotropic mass)
the dependence of V on various masses can be substi-
tuted by a dependence on one reference-mass (then sim-
ply called m) and a number of dimensionless parameters

V (α, , m, λ, q) = α ˜V (α, , m, λ, q) ,

(83)

where ˜V is dimensionless. Therefore its functional depen-
dence on all arguments must be in a way that the latter
are combined to dimensionless quantities. The unique
way (up to a dimensionless factor) to do so is given by
the scaled coordinates (√2mα/)q which allows one to
write

V (α, , m, λ, q) = α ¯V λ,r 2mα

2

q! ,

(84)

where ¯V is again dimensionless. The last step introduces
a temperature T and related inverse temperature β =
1/kBT which yields the thermal de-Broglie wavelength

as dimensionless, scaled coordinates. The ﬁnal general
scaling of the potential in terms of x is given by

V (α, , m, λ, q) = αU(cid:16)λ,pβαx(cid:17) .

(87)

Generic scaling of the propagator

In this section we consider the evolution of quantum
states in the system given by (81) in imaginary time
t = −iβ. The corresponding (non-unitary) evolution
operator for a ﬁxed relaxation “time” β is e−β ˆH.

Let |qi denote the eigenstates of ˆq with eigenvalues q

normalized as

hq′|qi = δ(D)(q′ − q) ,

(88)

and let further denote |ψi an arbitrary state of the system
and ψ(q) = hq|ψi its wavefunction. The action of the
evolution operator is given by the action of its exponent
which is (everything non-relativistic)

hq|β ˆH|ψi ="−βXi

(89)
where the scaled version of the potential energy is used
(see last subsection). Here, ∇2
q,i are Laplacians with re-
spect to some components of q. The diﬀerent masses
mi can be accounted for by deﬁning a reference mass m
and additional dimensionless parameters λi = m/mi that
might also be arguments to the potential U . In addition
T∇2
we rewrite the Laplacians as derivatives ∇2

state |ψ(β)i in terms of the scaled positions is then given
by

}

The scaled evolution kernel k only depends on xf , xi, λ,
and βα (but not on α or β alone) and hence the scaling of
the evolution kernel (or propagator) in real coordinates
is given by

{z

K(qf , qi; β) = hqf|e−β ˆH|qii
T k(λ−1

T qf ; λ, βα) .

(95)

The sole dependence of k on the scaled variables xi, xf ,
and βα is due to the scaling of the evolution operator (91)
on the one hand and the normalization condition (93) on
the other hand. The latter is here crucial, which can for
example be seen when deﬁning k by its diﬀerential equa-
tion in xi and βα together with an initial condition. One
should distinguish two cases.
i) If the potential energy
vanishes for α → 0, the initial condition can be taken
at β0 = 0 whereas ii) in case that the potential energy
vanishes for α → ∞, the reference point will be β0 → ∞.
Since the scaled kinetic part does not depend on β, both
cases are then summarized by the initial condition

(96)
The ﬁniteness of the initial condition is thereby guaran-
teed by the proper normalization of |xi states. Note that
the ﬁnite width of the gaussian in (96) is not contradic-
tory to the point-like initial condition of the propagator
in real coordinates

This essentially shows that the evolution operator only
involves the scaled coordinates x, some dimensionless pa-
rameters λ and the product βα of inverse temperature
(or relaxation “time”) and the potential coupling. We
write

e−β ˆH = e−ˆh(x,λ,βα) .

(91)

In order to express the (imaginary) time evolution of
any state in the scaled coordinates x, we deﬁne the posi-
tion eigenstates associated to the scaled coordinates (86)
as

D
2

|xi = λ

T |qi ,

(92)

which satisfy the normalization condition

Thq′|qi = λD

T δ(D)(λTx′−λTx) = δ(D)(x′−x) ,
hx′|xi = λD
(93)
only dependent on scaled coordinates x, x′. The evolu-
tion of any initial state |ψ(0)i to the corresponding ﬁnal

lim

β→0hqf|e−β ˆH|qii = δ(D)(qf − qi) ,

(97)

because the scaling ratio between x and q vanishes for
β → 0.
The speciﬁc form of the diﬀerential equation for
k(xf , xi; λ, βα) is not important for this argument, rather
it is the fact that it is an equation involving only xf , xi,
and βα which is crucial here. Nevertheless for complete-
ness the diﬀerential equation will be given in an abstract
form here and in an explicit form in the next subsection.
To ease notation we drop the dependence on λ, deﬁne the
thermal coupling s := βα and write ˆh(x, λ, βα) = ˆh(s).
The derivative w.r.t. s is given by

∂
∂s

k(xf , xi; s) = hxf|
∞Xj=0


(j + 1)! 
[−ˆh(s),− ∂ˆh

(98)

with the multiple commutator deﬁned as

[ ˆA, ˆB]j = [ ˆA, [ ˆA, ˆB]j−1] with [ ˆA, ˆB]0 := ˆB .

(99)

Since both ˆh(s) as well as ∂ˆh
∂s are built from the opera-
tors ˆx and the corresponding conjugate variables ˆk with
[ˆka, ˆxb] = −iδab, the term in brackets in (98) acts as a
diﬀerential operator on x that depends on s. Meaning
one can write

∂

k(xf , xi; s) = →

Dxf (s)k(xf , xi; s) ,

(100)

with some diﬀerential operator →
Dxf (s) acting on xf . The

is also independent of α, the scaled evolution kernel is
completely deﬁned independently of α, meaning there is

no explicit dependence on α. Therefore one can ommit
the subscript and write the scaling property for the prop-
agator in real coordinates and imaginary time as

Kα(qf , qi; β) = λ−D

T ksc(λ−1

T qi, λ−1

T qf ; βα) .

(111)

For simplicity we dropped the dependence on dimen-
sionless parameters λ in ksc which can always exist im-
plicitely.

In the following section, the scaling property (111) will
be used to derive universal scaling properties for QCE
contributions.

Universal scaling properties of QCE including

external potentials

Since (111) is a general property regardless of the di-
mension and explicit form of the potential V it holds also
for the propagator of systems of N distinguishable parti-

cles where V (q) =Pij vij (qi − qj) is an interaction po-

tential relating diﬀerent particles. Remarkably this holds
also if the interaction is applied only on a subset of par-
ticles. Furthermore, also diﬀerences of two propagators
where the interaction links diﬀerent subsets of particles
in the two cases are still subject to the general scaling
with βα. This enables us to write Ursell operators of
arbitrary order n as

α (qf , qi; β) = λ−nD
U (n)

T

˜u(n)(xf , xi; s) .

(112)

Moving to the indistinguishable case, an arbittrary
cluster contribution involves a product of Ursell oper-
ators and the ﬁnal conﬁguarions are given as a permuta-
tion of the initial conﬁguration qf = P (qi). This means
the integrand for an arbitrary cluster contribution of n
particles is given by a function

K (n)

α (P (q), q; β) = λ−nD

T

˜k(n)(P (x), x; s) ,

(113)

where K stands now for a product of ursell opera-
tors (112) and ˜k for its scaled version. The cluster con-
tribution is then the amplitude

ZΩ

dDq1 . . .ZΩ

dDqnK (n)

α (P (q), q; β) .

(114)

Since we talk about a single cluster, there is only one
invariant direction in q-space of a so constructed inte-
grand, which corresponds to the center-of-mass motion.
Otherwise the integral (114) would be seperable into dis-
tinct cluster-contributions per deﬁnition.

If additionally a smooth external conﬁnement poten-

tial Vext(q) = Pi vext(qi) is applied, we address it by

assuming it to be simultaniously constant for all n in-
volved particles. This is consistent with the short-time
philosophy of the QCE since for short times, the rele-
vant spread of the cluster is small compared to the scale

of variations in the external potential. This assumption
separates the amplitude (114) into an internal part

15

Zint =Z dDq2 . . .Z dDqn

× K (n)

α,int(P ((0, q2, . . . , qn)), (0, q2, . . . , qn); β) ,

(115)

that ﬁxes one of the coordinates, extends the integra-
tion over the others to inﬁnity and assumes zero external
potential, and an external part

Zext =Z dDq1K (1)

ext,n(q1, q1; β) ,

(116)

which corresponds to a single particle feeling the n-fold
external potential.

For the external potential we may use the generic scal-
ing property again, now introducing a parameter αext to
write

and consequently

Vext(q1) = αextUext(pβαextx1) ,
Zext =Z dDx1˜k(1)

ext,n(x1, βαext) .

(117)

(118)

The short-time eﬀect of the external potential can
thereby be considered as a local phase shift

K (1)
ext,n(q1, q1; β) ≃ λ−D

T e−βnVext(q1) ,

which leads to

where

Zext = nD/2ξ(pnβαext) ,
ξ(a) :=Z dDy e−a2Uext(ay) .

(119)

(120)

(121)

For homogeneously scaling external potentials this gives

Zext =(cid:18)n−d/2 Veﬀ

T (cid:19) nD/2 ,

λd

(122)

with the deﬁnitions of eﬀective dimension d and eﬀective
volume Veﬀ given in the main text.

Using the scaling (113) for the internal part gives

Zint(βα) =Z dDx2 . . . dDxn

× ˜k(n)

int (P ((0, x2, . . . , xn)), (0, x2, . . . , xn); s) ,

(123)

which is a function of only s = βα so that we are free to
write

Zint = nD/2a(βα) ,

(124)

which deﬁnes the internal amplitude a and where the
prefactor is inspired by the free case and explicit QCE(1)
calculations in the case of δ-interaction but can be deﬁned
like that in any case.

In total, the contribution (114) from a speciﬁc cluster

in homogeneous external potentials has the form

α (β) = n−d/2 Veﬀ
A(C)

T

a(C)(βα) ,

(125)

where C denotes a speciﬁc internal cluster-structure that
does not depend on any system parameters.

Appendix G: Energy shifting method

For the purpose of this section we write the non-

interacting counting function as

N0( ˜E) = cN ˜EN d/2 + cN−1 ˜E(N−1)d/2 + . . . ,

(126)

with the scaled total energy

˜E = E(cid:18) 2

2m

V −2/d

eﬀ (cid:19)−1

,

(127)

which is a quantity depending on the (eﬀective) system
size. The observation of full shifts ∆E∞ between the
limits α → 0 and α → ∞ is

∆ ˜E∞ = ˜aN (2/d−1)/N ,

(128)

with some constant ˜a, so that the fully shifted counting
function

N∞( ˜E) = N0(E − ∆E∞)

(129)

can be expanded in the large ˜E limit (which is at the
same time a large Veﬀ limit) to

N∞( ˜E)

= cN ˜EN d

(130)

16

Thus the leading correction from the shift is of the same
order in ˜E as the ﬁrst sub-leading term in (126), so that
it can be matched to the sub-leading term of the non-
interacting fermionic counting function, which is simply
a negative of the free bosonic term. We identify

cN−1 + N

(131)

to ﬁx the constant ˜a for the full shift.

In the case of arbitrary interaction strength α, the

ansatz is

∆ ˜Eα = ˜χ(E/α)N (2/d−1)/N ,

(132)

where now one has to do a clear distinction between the
variables ˜E (which scales with the volume) and E
α (which
scales with the interaction strength). Meaning, we are
free to do an expansion for large ˜E while considering E
α
as independent variable.
In other words one can do a
large Veﬀ expansion to get
Nα( ˜E)

(133)

As also the ﬁrst order QCE correction is in general of
the order ˜E(N−1) d
2 , the shifting fraction ˜χ can be exactly
matched to the later. In the 1D case with δ-interaction
and without external potential this can be expressed in
terms of (41) as

χ(E/α) = −

Γ( N +1
2 )
2zN−1

g(N )

α(cid:19) ,
N−1(cid:18) E

(134)

where χ(E/α) = ˜χ(E/α)˜a−1 is now the unscaled energy
shift fraction fulﬁlling

∆Eα = χ(E/α)∆E∞ .

(135)

The corresponding expression for homogeneous external
potentials is then related by the general scaling property
(see appendix F).
