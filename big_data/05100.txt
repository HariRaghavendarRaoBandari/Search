Abstract

In recent works on nuclear magnetic moments in which some of the current authors participated
it was felt that missing conﬁgurations which were too hard to handle could nevertheless be important.
Motivated by this we here construct a simple model which will enable us to evaluate the eﬀects of high
lying conﬁgurations.We start with 2 neutrons in the g9/2 shell and then admix systematically other
conﬁgurations : h11/2h11/2 , h11/2h9/2 and h9/2h9/2 and examine how conﬁgurations aﬀect the magnetic
moments (g factors) of J = 2+,4+and 6+states.

Introduction

The nuclear magnetic moment of a free neutron in units of µN is −1.913 ( +2.793 for a proton). The
magnetic moment operator is gsS + glL .
Allowing for quenching we have for a neutron gs = −3.826x where for x = 1 there is no quenching . Also
for a neutron we have gl = 0 while for a proton gl = 1. However often the values gl = −0.2 Z/A is used for
the neutron and 1 + 0.2N/A for the proton.

For some odd-odd nucleon, where the two nucleons are in diﬀerent shells, we may use total momentum
J = J1 + J2 to characterize the state of the system, where J1 and J2 are angular momentum operators of
nucleon 1 and nucleon. Then we have

g =

2

(g1 + g2) + (g1 − g2)

j1(j1 + 1) − j2(j2 + 1)

2j(j + 1)

Where g1 and g2 are g factors of nucleon 1 and nucleon 2. We will use this equation to calculate the g

factors of single nucleon state and two mixed nucleon state in the end of this section.

Often when large scale shell model calculations of nuclear magnetic moments are performed, one is
frustrated by the fact that one cannot include conﬁgurations that might be important. Because the model
space becomes too large to handle. One example in which some of the current authors were involved is the
work of Kumartzki et al[1].

In this work we will consider a very simple system of 2 neutrons in various shells. We start with the

conﬁguration

[g7/2g7/2]J with J = 2, 4 and 6. The g factors for all 3 cases are the same and are equal to the single
particle g factor in the g7/2 shell. The free value is 0.42511. We will see how this number changes when we

1

use a more elaborate wave function:

ΨJ = a[g/2g7/2]J + b[h11/2h11/2]J + c

√2
2

([h11/2(1)h9/2(2)]J − [h11/2(2)h9/2(1)]J ) + d[h9/2h9/2]J

The four terms in the wave function associated with a,b,c,d are chosen to be the basis states and |a|2 is
the probability ﬁnding the system in the state of g7/2g7/2,so as |b|2,|c|2,|d|2 The g factors of the basis states
are respectively +0.42511, −0.34782, −0.63767/J(J + 1) and +0.34782. The g factor for h9/2 is equal but
opposite to that of h11/2. g factor of the mixed state of h11/2 and h9/2 is J dependant.

Calculations.

We will obtain the wave functions and g factors using a surface delta interaction. This was used previously
for g factor calculations[2, 3].

The matrix element of the SDI interaction can be written as follows:

< j1j2|SDI|j3j4 >= C0f (j1, j2)f (j3, j4)

(1)

where f (j1, j2) = (−1)j2+ 1

2q (2j1+1)(2j2+1)

(2J+1)(1+δj1 j2 ) · Dj1j2

Note that the expression is separable. We have used this interaction in previous works [2, 3]. We choose
c0 to be −0.200M eV . In Table I we have the same single particle splitting for the three h conﬁgurations
E, and show resits for E = +0.5M ev and E = 1.0M ev. It is really the ratio E/C0 that is the relevant
parameter.

Initial Case: [g7/2g7/2] All J

0.4251

In case 1, we only include [h11/2h11/2] and [g7/2g7/2], since c and d are set to be 0. For Case 2, we will
also include [h9/2h9/2], that is, only c is set to zero. Lastly in Case 3, we include all 4 conﬁgurations, that
is a, b, c, and d are not 0. Let us ﬁrst focus on the g factors of J = 2+ state. The g factor of initial case is
0.4251, and it reduces to 0.2870 when we include [h11/2h11/2],(c = d = 0) i.e. a 32.5% reduction. This is
due to the fact that the h11/2h11/2 conﬁguration has a g factor that is the opposite sign of that of g7/2g7/2.
In general a g factor of j = l + 1/2 state has the opposite sign diﬀer from that of j = l − 1/2 state.
We then set c = 0. Here is the counter-intuitivity comes in. The g factor of the h9/2 neutron is equal
and opposite to that of a h11/2 neutron. This would suggest that h9/2 would undo the damage done by h11/2
leading to a g factor closer to that of a pure g7/2g7/2 conﬁguration. But the opposite is true. The value in
this case is 0.2497 as compared with 0.2870.

To understand what is happening, we show the detailed wave functions in Table II for the case E =
+0.5.The important point is that the amplitude a is much smaller in case 2.
Introducing the conﬁgura-
tion h9/2h9/2 causes the g7/2g7/2 probability be depleted. However the h11/2h11/2 component does not get
depleted. In fact g is slightly enhanced. Clearly these eﬀects are beyond ﬁrst order perturbation theory.

We note that the g factors, which were J independent for the conﬁguration g7/2g7/2 are now all diﬀerent.

With J = 2, g factor is the smallest, g(J = 4) is in middle, and g(J = 6) is the largest.

In closing we note that more often than not experiments are performed for nuclei which are diﬃcult to
handle theoretically. We view this work as exploratory. We start with the simplest conﬁgurations. This
enables us to include conﬁgurations that are not possible for in general. The way the high lying conﬁgurations
aﬀect the physical properties (in this case g factors) in this simple case gives us a clue of what is missing in
the more complex situations.

In the Table III we show the values of G(2) for various values of E. The behavior is a bit complex. Up
to E = +0.2 the values in Case 1 ([h11/2h11/2] are included)are smaller than those in case 2([h11/2h11/2] and
[h9/2h9/2] are included). But small E corresponds to strong coupling. For E = +0.3 and beyond we get a
reversal with Case 2 yielding g factors smaller than that of Case 1. But higher E means weaker coupling so
one might have expected the opposite behavior. In table II there is a considerable depletion of the g7/2g7/2
conﬁguration when one goes from Case 1 to Case 2.

In Table IV we show the results with all the conﬁgurations present. We do it for Case 3 as before, where
the h11/2 and h9/2 are degenerate at and energy E above g7/2 and a new case 4 where h11/2 is at an energy
E and h9/2 is at an energy E = +0.25.

We would, priori expect Case 4 to give smaller values than case 3 because we have raised the energy of
the h9/2 energy relative to h11/2. This is indeed true up to E = 0.5 but for E = 1 and 2 there is a reversal.
But for E = 4 and 5 we are back to the ordering for E equal or less than 0.5. It is not surprising that as E
getting very large, g(2) approaches to the singe particle value of g9/2 ,which equals 0.42511.

Explanation

To attempt an explanation of the counter-intuitive results we compare the results for Case 1 (We will denote
G as g factor to avoid confusion between g of g factor and g of g state):

[g7/2g7/2] + [h11/2h11/2] with Case 2: [g7/2g7/2] + [h11/2h11/2] + [h9/2h9/2].
In Case 1 the value of G(J) = a2G(g7/2) + b2g(h11/2) = g(g7/2) + b2(G(h11/2) − G(g7/2))
In Case 2 the value is c2G(g7/2) + d2G(h11/2) + e2G(h9/2) . Since c2 + d2 + e2 = 1
G(J) = G(g7/2)(1 − d2 − e2) + (d2 − e2)G(h11/2)
We see G(Case1) − G(Case2) = (d2 + e2 − b2)G(g7/2) + (b2 − d2 + e2)G(h11/2).
In perturbation theory we have b = d. Using this we ﬁnd
G(Case1) − G(Case2) = e2(G(g7/2) + G(h11/2) = e2(1.913/4.5 − 1.913/5.5) = +0.07729e2
We see that Case 1 gives a larger value than case 2 for all e2 in this approximation. Weak coupling or
strong coupling- we get the same qualitative behavior i.e.introducing h9/2 to the existing h11/2 admixture
does not cancel out the eﬀect of the h11/2 admixture but rather enhances it.

We can simulate perturbation theory by simply setting a to one. Let use the E = 0.5 as an example.
Whereas in the “exact” calculation, the values in the 3 cases were respectively (0.2870,0.2497, 0.2015) , now
with a = 1 we obtain (0.3629,0.4123,0.3738). Whereas in the case where a is less than one we go from large
l to smaller one ,in the perturbation calculation (a = 1) we go from small to large smallest. There is a
qualitative diﬀerence.

We repeat that it is of value to study simple systems.in this case the 2 neutron conﬁguration , because
it enables us to include more conﬁgurations than is at present possible for more complicated conﬁgurations.
We can get some idea of what the missing elements of these more complex conﬁgurations do.

Appendix: Expressions for the G factors

Again, we use the symbol G for the g factors so as to distinguish them form the g in g7/2. Note that in a
single j shell of particles of one kind all g factors are the same.In particular for this case the g factor of 2
g7/2 is the same as that of one. The same is true for h9/2 and h11/2.

Te expression for the g factors is:
G(J) = a2G(g7/2) + b2G(h11/2) + c2(G(h11/2h9/2) + d2G(h9/2) + CrosstermA + CrosstermB
Here we have:
G(h11/2h9/2) = [G(h11/2) + G(h9/2)]/2 + [G(h11/2) − G(h9/2)]/(2J(J + 1))(11/2∗13/2 − 9/2∗11/2)
CrossA = 1/p2(J(J + 1) · 4bc · U (1, 4.5, J; 5.5, 5.5, J) < h11/2||µ||h9/2 >
CrossB = −1/p2J(J + 1) · 4cd · U (1, 5.5, J, 4.5; 4.5, J) < h9/2||µ||h11/2 >
The numerical values for bare operators are:
G(g7/2) = 0.4251 , G(h11/2) = −0.3478, G(h9/2) = +0.34782.
G(h11/2h9/2) = −3.8260/(J(J + 1)). The respective values for J = 2, 4, and 6 are −0.6377, −0.1913 and
−0.0911
In the above U is a unitary Racah coeﬃcient and at the end we have reduced matrix elements of the
magnetic moment operator µ = gLL + gSσ/2. The bare values are gL = 0 and gS = −3.826. Our reduced
matrix element is one used by Lawson[4] :
