Abstract
A series of experiments was performed to obtain permeability data on FiberForm R(cid:13),
a commercial carbon preform used for manufacturing thermal protection sys-

tems. A porous sample was placed in a quartz ﬂow-tube heated by an isothermal

furnace. The setup was instrumented to measure mass ﬂow through and pres-

sure drop across the sample. The intrinsic permeability and the Klinkenberg

correction, which accounts for rareﬁed eﬀects, were computed from the exper-

imental data. The role of the gas temperature and pressure on the eﬀective

permeability is shown, and it is demonstrated that with proper data reduction,

the intrinsic permeability is strictly a function of the micro-structure of the

material. A function for the eﬀective permeability of FiberForm, dependent on

temperature, pressure, pore geometry, and type of gas is proposed. The intrin-
sic permeability was evaluated at K0 = 5.57 × 10−11 m2, with a Klinkenberg
parameter of 8c/dp = 2.51 × 105 m−1 and a reference porosity of φ† = 0.87.

1. Introduction

The entry process into a planetary atmosphere requires spacecraft to be

equipped with a thermal protection system (TPS). The TPS protects the space-

craft from the high enthalpy and thermochemical conditions of entry, during

which the hypersonic ﬂow surrounding the vehicle generates strong aerothermal

2

heating. An ablator is usually used as a TPS material for the harshest entry

conditions due to the chemical and physical phenomena that take place when

high heat ﬂuxes are experienced. The ablator materials signiﬁcantly reduce the

heat to the inner parts of the vehicle, protecting the payload [1]. In recent years

the focus has veered toward a new class of low-density carbon/resin ablators, the

most successful of which is NASA’s own phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator

(PICA) [2], used in Earth return and Mars exploration missions [3, 4].

Figure 1: Scanning electron micrograph of FiberForm.

PICA uses FiberForm R(cid:13) (Fiber Materials, Inc.) [5], a rigid carbon ﬁber com-
posite, as a substrate. As shown by the scanning electron micrograph in Fig. 1,
its micro-structure is characterized by thin carbon ﬁbers (≈ 10 m in diameter)
and pores of ≈ 50 m in diameter [6]. The pores occupy nearly a 90% fraction
of the volume of the material, providing it with excellent insulation properties.

Because of their high porosity, gases can easily ﬂow within the ablative ma-

terials. For example, pyrolysis gases produced by decomposition of the phenolic

3

resin travels through the charred structure – potentially reacting with the ﬁbers

– before exiting the material. Likewise, reactants from the boundary layer can

enter the material microstructure and ﬂow within the pores. This gas transport

has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the overall material response [7–9].

The ﬂow behavior through a porous structure is characterized by the perme-

ability, as it dominates the momentum transport within the medium. Perme-

ability is therefore a key material property when modeling porous media ﬂow.

When the mean free path λ of the gas molecules approaches the dimensions

of the material pores, the gas ﬂow within the material is considered transitional

between the continuum and Knudsen regimes. In this regime, slip eﬀects become

important.

A method for measuring the permeability of porous refractory insulators was

proposed by Marschall and Milos [10, 11] and applied to various materials, such

as silica-based tiles, PICA (in virgin and charred from), ceramics, and to a lesser

extent, FiberForm. Data on FiberForm in Ref. [10] were obtained up to 300 K

on an older, less dense version of the material with large observed variabilities

in the samples.

The experiments documented in the current work provide an updated set

of FiberForm permeability values at temperatures ranging from 298 to 1500

K, in inert atmosphere. The data generated also constitute a baseline for the

numerical rebuilding of eﬀective reactivity data from experiments on the high-

temperature decomposition of FiberForm [12].

2. Experiment

A high-temperature ﬂow-tube setup (Fig. 2) was assembled to perform gas/material

interaction experiments on porous samples. The system consisted of a 129.5 cm

long, 22 mm inner diameter quartz tube positioned inside of an open-ended

furnace providing temperatures up to 1675 K by means of a radiative ceramic

element. The cylindrical plug samples (FiberForm) were inserted in the tube by

interference ﬁtting, and positioned in the center of the furnace, using a plastic

4

dowel rod. As discussed in the related literature [10, 11], the axial geometry of

the porous material plays a major role in the permeability.

Because of its manufacturing method, FiberForm is an orthotropic material.

More speciﬁcally, it is transverse isotropic, since most of the ﬁbers are oriented
within ±15◦ of the compression plane. The direction perpendicular to this plane
is deﬁned as “Through-Thickness” (TT) and that parallel as “In-Plane” (IP).

The bulk of the experiments described here were performed on samples machined

with a TT orientation, in which the carbon ﬁbers are preferentially aligned

perpendicular to the gas ﬂow direction. One experiment was also performed

with a sample oriented in the IP direction. A dedicated mass ﬂow controller

(Aalborg Model: UFC 8160) calibrated to nitrogen triﬂuoride was controlled

by a Tylan RO-28 Readout/Control Box to feed the argon gas at ﬁxed ﬂow

rates ranging between 10 and 100 sccm. The system was evacuated by means
of an Alcatel R301B Roots pump using Fomblin R(cid:13) oil and backed by an Alcatel
BF ADP 81 dry pump. The pumping manifold was outﬁtted with a copper

mesh to collect particulates that might be emitted during the experiment. The

outlet of the ﬂow-tube was connected to the vacuum system through a manual

The main tube was equipped with both an upstream (P1) and downstream

(P2) port from the furnace, which were connected to a manifold of calibrated
diﬀerential pressure transducers measuring the pressure loss (P1−P2) across the
sample. A separate set of pressure gauges were also used to monitor absolute

pressure conditions.

A valving manifold was used to control gas ﬂows and normalize pressure in

the system when starting experiment operations. One set of these valves was

used as a by-pass to prevent the formation of strong pressure gradients across

the sample during evacuation or venting operations that could potentially move

the sample from the desired initial position. Thermocouple (TC) sensors were

installed at diﬀerent strategic positions along the tube as depicted in Fig. 2. Two

Type-K thermocouples were used to measure the temperature T1 and T2 at the

pressure ports P1 and P2, respectively, and two other Type-K TCs monitored

the temperature Tin and Tout at the inlet and outlet of the furnace. A Type-S

and Type-K TC were used to measure the temperature of the sample Ts and

the temperature of the furnace Tf , respectively, at the position of the carbon

plug. A two-color pyrometer (Mikron M90-R2) pointed at the upstream surface

of the sample was also used as a redundant temperature measurement for the

tests at temperature above 1200 K. All of these temperature measurements

agreed within 10 K.

Pressure and temperature measurements were acquired at 4 s intervals by

a dedicated acquisition card (NI Model USB-6210). A customized LabView

interface recorded each parameter directly to a computer.

The protocol for the experiments followed that of Marschall and Milos [10].

First, length and mass of the FiberForm samples were measured, and sample

densities were calculated. The samples were then inserted into the Quartz tube,

the system was evacuated to a base pressure P < 13.33 Pa, and the background

temperature was stabilized to a steady target while supplying a constant 10

sccm Ar ﬂow to the system.

The permeability of virgin char in an Ar environment was measured as fol-

6

lows. Absolute pressure, diﬀerential pressure, and temperature data were col-

lected at a frequency resolution of δf = 0.25 Hz until a steady state was reached.

Gas ﬂow was stopped following the measurement.

The furnace was then cooled, and the FiberForm samples were removed by

pushing from the backside of the plug toward the pyrometer. Post-testing mass

and length measurements were performed on the samples. Negligible mass loss

and length changes were measured compared with pre-testing measurements.

3. Permeability in the slip regime

The permeability of FiberForm was determined by measuring the pressure

gradient ∆P across the sample for a given combination of temperature T , mass

ﬂow rate ˙m, and gas mixture including viscosity µ and molar mass M . Klinken-

berg derived an expression that accounts for non-continuum eﬀects in porous

media [13]. This equation describes the permeability as a function of the Knud-

sen number Kn = λ/dp. Here, λ is the mean free path of gas molecules and

dp is the mean pore diameter of the material, assumed to be the characteristic

length of the porous medium. This Klinkenberg expression takes the form of an

eﬀective permeability

Keﬀ = K0

1 + 8c

(1)

where K0 is the value of the permeability in the limit of continuum ﬂow regime,

and c is a proportional constant. Accounting for pressure and temperature, the

mean free path can be expressed as:

thus obtaining the Klinkenberg expression for the eﬀective permeability:

Because the ﬂow-tube conﬁguration produces a well-deﬁned and well-characterized

ﬂow, it is possible to analyze the ﬂow ﬁeld using an analytical approach and ex-

tract the permeability parameters from the experimental results. By combining

Eq. 4 with the conservation of mass, ideal gas law, the geometry of the sample,

and Darcy’s Law, the following relationship can be derived for one dimensional,

laminar and isothermal ﬂows:

(7)

In these equations, L and D are length and diameter of the sample, and

Pavg = 0.5(P1 + P2) is the average pressure in the sample. As for F , it is a force

that results from the material permeability, and is only dependent on known

constants or measured experimental values.

For the conditions of the current experiments, the argon ﬂow within the

porous medium is in the rareﬁed regime. For temperatures between 1000 and

2000 K, and pressures between 1 and 10 kPa, the Knudsen number remains

between 0.06 and 2. This wide variation supports the use of the Klinkenberg

equation to correct the permeability.

4. High-temperature permeability measurements

Since all quantities in the left-hand side of Eq. 7 are known or measured, K0

and b can be obtained by a linear least-squares ﬁt of F = F (Pavg). The slope

provides the value for K0, and depends on the material micro-structure only.

The abscissa at zero ordinate divided by K0 provides b and depends on the ﬂow

temperature, the type of gas, as well as on the material micro-structure through

the average pore diameter.

An example of permeability measurements in Ar ﬂow, at temperatures from

310 to 1320 K, is shown in Fig. 3 for sample TT07. F is a linear function of P

with constant slope. To build a representative database for the permeability of

FiberForm, multiple samples were tested at various conditions. The results from

these tests are presented in Table 1. The full set of measured data is provided

in Table 4 of the supplementary material.

The dependency of parameter b on the temperature and the type of gas can

be removed by normalizing the data to a standard condition for the gas, here

chosen to be 298 K. Replacing temperature-dependent terms with an asterisk,
Eq. 7 becomes F ∗ = K0(Pavg + b∗), where b∗ is calculated by normalizing Eq. 3
as

Fig. 4 also illustrates the strong transverse isotropic properties of FiberForm

with a comparison to the IP conﬁguration. This geometry allows the gas to ﬂow

more easily along the axial direction of the planar alignment of the ﬁbers, and

diﬀerent slopes, which results into distinctive intrinsic permeability values K0.

The numerical values, presented in Table 2, also show that the rareﬁed term,

8c/dp does not vary with direction, as expected, since it is only a function of

the average pore size.

Table 2 shows a non-negligible scatter in the measured density of the samples

due to the method of fabrication of FiberForm that generates inhomogeneities,
as can be seen in Fig. 1. To further normalize the samples, F ∗ becomes F † using
a factor φ†/φ that accounts for the deviation of the density of each sample from
the nominal density.

In this factor, the porosity φ is calculated according to:

φ = 1 − ρ
ρC

(9)

where ρC is the density of the ﬁbers. A value of ρC = 1400 kg/m3 is calculated
by using the average density of the samples ρ† = 183.6 kg/m3 and the average
reported open porosity of FiberForm is φ† = 0.869 [5]. The new normalized
results using F † are plotted in Fig. 5.

Despite this density normalization, some scatter remains, likely due to the

non-uniformity of the speciﬁc micro-structure of each sample, or the Forch-

heimer eﬀects, which account for inertial deviations to Darcy’s law at high

velocities [14, 15]. As was also the case for other classes of porous ablators [10],

the scatter is most pronounced at high mass ﬂow rates, reinforcing the Forch-

heimer eﬀect hypothesis. Nevertheless, a parametric curve can be ﬁtted to the

data, and a single expression for the permeability, based on the normalization

and Eqs. 1 and 2, can be obtained:

where K0 = 5.57 × 10−11 m2, 8c/dp = 2.51 × 105 m−1 and φ† = 0.87.
Equation 10 can therefore be directly used in Material Response codes when

modeling FiberForm, and is valid at any temperature and pressure.

The proportionality constant c can be evaluated using the mean pore diam-

Using an average ﬁber diameter df of 11 µm, a value of dp,IP ≈ 96 µm is

there is no perfect match, since Eq. 10 uses all the dispersed experimental data

based on Eq. 4 is closer to the experimental values since it was generated using

these. Outside of the pressure range where measurements were collected, the

ﬁt is less accurate but still within acceptable errors, and the use of Eq. 10 is

recommended for modeling the permeability in numerical simulations.

5. Error Analysis

The uncertainty associated with the calculation of F depends on the un-

certainty contained in the measured and calculated parameters found in Eq. 7,
which are xi = {µ, ˙m, R, T, L, D, M, ∆P}. If the uncertainty given by the vari-
ables δxi is small and there is no covariance between them, the error contained

in F can be written as:

(cid:34) N(cid:88)

(cid:19)2

∂xi

(13)

It should be noted that, since µ and T are dependent variables, the null

covariance condition for the Taylor series expansion is not strictly satisﬁed;

however, it is estimated that considering µ and T as independent variables does

not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the values of the calculated uncertainty.

In order to

simplify Eq. 13, F can be expressed as:

F =

If suﬃciently small (≤ 20 %), the standard deviation of the natural logarithm
of a random variable is approximately equal to the relative standard error, i.e.,

i=1

δln xi = δxi/xi. Therefore, Eq. 13 can be approximated with suﬃcient accuracy

In Eq. 18, δR and δM are negligible, and δL and δD are very small. There-

fore, the main contributions to errors on F are associated with mass ﬂow rate,

temperature, and consequently gas viscosity and pressure measurements. A list

of the determined uncertainties associated with each input variable is provided

in Table 1. The total uncertainty associated with F was calculated using Eq. 18
to be ± 8.2 %.

One additional source of error in K0 and b is due to the least-square ﬁt of the

F = F (Pav) function. For the experiments presented above, the coeﬃcient of

determination was found to be R2 > 0.99 for each of the acquired measurements.

Using the parameters in Table 3, by numerical ﬁts, the uncertainty associated
with K0 was found to be ±10% and with b was found to be ±2%.

A ﬁnal remark on the overall uncertainty in permeability is related to the

large-scale variability of FiberForm. As shown in Section 4, small material sam-

ples show a scatter in density on the order of 10%. The experiment presented

here captures the dependence of local permeability parameters with local den-

sity. However, visual inspection of larger samples reveals density variations in

the Through-Thickness direction, more speciﬁcally compressed and expanded

layers, and also wavy areas where the local Through-Thickness vector varies in

orientation, perhaps by 10 of 15 degrees. It may be appropriate to consider such

large-scale variabilities when modeling a large volume of FiberForm.

6. Conclusions

The presented work provides a benchmark dataset of the permeability prop-

erties of FiberForm. This approach is fundamental in that it allows for a wide

variety of experimental testing on internal oxidation reactions in partially dis-

sociated air ﬂows and the chemical evolution of representative pyrolysis gas

mixtures by heterogeneous surface reactions with a hot char. Furthermore, a

standard practice has been deﬁned for handling porous materials in a ﬂow-tube,

which can be applied to oxidation experiments with reactive gas species. In our

protocol, the acquisition of permeability data at both room temperature and at

18

oxidation temperature, prior to the start of the reactive gas/material interaction

and material recession phase, can be used as a tool for comparison to verify the

absence of leakage in the interference ﬁtting of the sample in the tube.

Finally, by deﬁning temperature- and pressure-independent permeability pa-

rameters, the work presented here provides an improvement to the material

property databases used in high-ﬁdelity Computational Fluid Dynamics and

Material Response codes, which are of the utmost importance as the need for

more accurate spacecraft re-entry simulations increases.
