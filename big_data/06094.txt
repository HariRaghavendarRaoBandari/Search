In this paper, we provided conditions for an entire constant mean curvature

Killing graph lying inside a possible unbounded region to be necessarily a slice.

Abstract

Let N n+1 denote a complete Riemannian manifold carrying a warped product struc-
ture N n+1 = M n ×ρ R with warping function ρ ∈ C ∞(M) such that M n is noncompact.
Let s ∈ R parametrize the line factor in N n+1. Then Y = ∂/∂s is a Killing vector
ﬁeld free of singularities with integrable orthogonal distribution and ρ = |Y |. Moreover,
the leaves M n × {s0}, s0 ∈ R, of the orthogonal distribution to Y form a foliation by
complete isometric totally geodesic hypersurfaces called slices.
Fix a slice M n = M n × {0} and denote by Ψ : R × M n → N n+1 the ﬂux generated
by Y . The Killing graph Σ(u) associated to a function u ∈ C 2(M) is the hypersurface

Σ(u) = {Ψ(u(x), x) : x ∈ M n}.

Recently we proved in [4] that under certain conditions any entire bounded Killing graph
with constant mean curvature must be a slice. Bounded means that the graph lies inside
a slab, i.e., a set M n × I where I ⊂ R is a closed interval.
It is a natural question if the condition that the graph is bounded can be weakened.
In fact, this was recently shown to be the case by Rosenberg, Schulze and Spruck [9]
for minimal graphs in a Riemannian product in M n × R where only a lower bound
was required.
In turn, their result extended a well known theorem due to Bombieri,
De Giorgi and Miranda [1] for hypersurfaces in the Euclidean space that also holds for
constant mean curvature due to independent work of Chern [2] and Flanders [5].

We denote by d(x) = dist(x, p) the geodesic distance from p ∈ M n and by BR(p) the
geodesic ball centered at p with radius R > 0. We also will make use of the notations
ρ0 = supM ρ and ρ1 = supM |∇ρ|.

Theorem 1. Let N n+1 = M n ×ρ R be a Riemannian warped product manifold where
M n is complete, noncompact such that KM ≥ −K0 for K0 ≥ 0 and RicM ≥ 0. Assume
inf M ρ > 0 and kρkC 2(M ) < ∞. Then, any Killing graph with constant mean curvature
H ≤ 0 lying inside a region of the form

R = (cid:26)Ψ(s, x) : 0 ≤ s ≤

1
αβ

(C − log αρ(x))(cid:27)

for constants α > 1, C > log αρ0 and β ≥ n|H|ρ0 + 2ρ1 positive must be a slice.

From the above theorem one can easily recover the result in [4] by a slight addition

to the proof; see Remark 1 for details.

The proof of Theorem 1 is done assuming kρkC 1(M ) < ∞ and RicN ≥ −L for some
constant L ≥ 0. That these conditions are weaker than kρkC 2(M ) < ∞ follows from the
relation between the Ricci curvatures of N n+1 and M n given by

RicN (v, v) = RicM (π∗v, π∗ v) −

HessM ρ(π∗ v, π∗ v) −
where π denotes the projection from N n+1 to the factor M n.

The region R in the above result is determined by the warping function ρ and may

be unbounded as shown in the following example.
Example 1. Let M n be a complete noncompact manifold with a pole at p ∈ M n and
denote the radial coordinate by r. Take ρ(r) = c + e−ψ(r) for some constant c > 0 and a
smooth function ψ > 0 with ψ′ > 0 such that ψ(r) → +∞ and ψ′(r) → 0 as r → +∞.
In this situation, the region R is unbounded.

The main achievement in this paper is a strong improvement of the gradient estimate
for Killing graphs when compared with the one in [4]. Here as there, we make use of the
Korevaar-Simon method [7] to show the existence of an a priori gradient estimate for a
nonnegative solution of the corresponding PDE for constant mean curvature H over a
geodesic ball BR(p).

The function G ∈ C ∞([0, +∞)) in the following result veriﬁes that f ′′ = Gf where
f ∈ C ∞([0, +∞)) satisﬁes f (0) = 0, f ′(0) = 1, that f > 0 outside the origin and f ′ ≥ 0.
We also use the notation ̺0 = supBR(p) ρ and ̺1 = supBR(p) |∇ρ|.
Theorem 2. Let N n+1 = M n ×ρ R be a complete Riemannian manifold satisfying that
RicN ≥ −L for some constant L ≥ 0. Assume that the radial sectional curvatures on
M n along the geodesics issuing from a ﬁxed point p ∈ M n satisfy K M
rad ≥ −G(d). Let
Σ(u) be a Killing graph with constant mean curvature H over BR(p) such that

0 ≤ u ≤

(1)

for constants α > 1, C > log α̺0 and β ≥ n|H|̺0 + 2̺1 positive. Then, we have that

|∇M u(p)| ≤ D

where the constant D = D(α, C, β,|H|, u(p)) is given by (20).
Proof: It was shown in [3] that a Killing graph Σ(u) has mean curvature H if and only
if the function u ∈ C 2(M) satisﬁes the elliptic PDE of divergence form

Here H is computed with respect to the orientation of the Gauss map given by

(γY − Ψ∗∇M u) where W = pγ + |∇M u|2.

(2)

In the sequel ∇ and ∆ denote the gradient and Laplace operator on Σ(u). If H is

constant it is well-known [6] that

∆hY,Ni = −(|A|2 + RicN (N ))hY,Ni

where |A| stands for the norm of the second fundamental form of Σ(u). Thus, using
that hY,Ni = 1/W we obtain

where s parametrizes the line factor R in N n+1. Let K+ denote the solid half-cylinder
Ψ(R+ × BR) with BR = BR(p) and let φ : K+ → R be the function

φ(y) = (1 − h(d(x)) − C0ξ(s))+ if y = Ψ(s, x) ∈ K+

where C0 = 1/2 ξ(u(p)) > 0 and + means taking the positive part. Let η be the function
supported in the portion of the graph Σ(u) over BR given by

η(y) = eKφ(y) − 1,
3

y = Ψ(u(x), x),

for some constant K > 0 and set U = ηW .

Let Ψ(u(q), q) with q ∈ BR be a (necessarily interior) point of maximum of U. We
ﬁrst consider the case when q ∈ BR\C(p), where C(p) is the cut locus of p in M n, thus
U is smooth near q. Without further reference in the sequel we compute at Ψ(u(q), q).
It holds that

Since the Hessian form of U is nonpositive, we have from (3) that

Making use of the Ricci curvature assumption, we obtain

∆U = W(cid:0)∆η + (|A|2 + RicN (N ))η(cid:1) ≤ 0.

or, equivalently, that

∆η ≤ Lη

(4)
In the sequel, we estimate both terms in the left hand side of (4). We have ¯∇s = γY
where ¯∇ denotes the gradient in N n+1 but also will stand for the Riemannian connection
in N n+1. Where the function φ is diﬀerentiable and positive, we have

To conclude the proof we observe that the same argument given in [9] proves that
(cid:3)

the restriction that q 6∈ C(p) can be dropped.

taking R → +∞ in Theorem 2. To see this we choose the function

We now make use of part of the argument in [4] to prove that H = 0. It was shown
there the Omori-Yau maximum principle for the Laplacian holds on Σ(u). Moreover,
we have that u = s|Σ satisﬁes

H +

(21)

∆u =

pγ + |∇M u|2

Being u a bounded function from below on Σ(u), the Omori-Yau maximum principle
assures that there exists a sequence {yk}k∈N such that

|∇u(yk)| < 1/k and ∆u(yk) > −1/k.

Since we have already shown that the coeﬃcient of H is bounded from below by a
positive number, we obtain from (21) that H = 0.

Remark 1. Notice that the above argument can be used to show that a graph of any
constant mean curvature H inside a slab must be minimal.

We conclude the proof with an argument from [4] or [9]. Now the PDE can be

written as Lu = 0 where

Lu = e−ϕdivΣeϕ∇u, ϕ = 2 log ρ.

In a system of coordinates {xi}n

i=1 in M n with σij = h∂xi, ∂xji, we have
L = e−ϕdivΣ(eϕgijui∂xj )

where

gij = σij −

uiuj
W 2 and ui = σikuk.

Since there is a global gradient estimate, then L is an uniformly elliptic operator in
divergence form. Hence, if we view L as a operator acting on M n and since RicM ≥ 0,
it follows from Theorem 7.4 in [10] that u is constant.
