For quantum ﬁeld theories with topological sectors, Monte Carlo simulations
on ﬁne lattices tend to be obstructed by an extremely long auto-correlation
time with respect to the topological charge. Then reliable numerical mea-
surements are feasible only within individual sectors. The challenge is to
assemble such restricted measurements in a way that leads to a substanti-
ated approximation to the fully ﬂedged result, which would correspond to the
correct sampling over the entire set of conﬁgurations. We test an approach
for such a topological summation, which was suggested by Brower, Chan-
drasekharan, Negele and Wiese. Under suitable conditions, energy levels
and susceptibilities can be obtained to a good accuracy, as we demonstrate
for O(N) models, SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, and for the Schwinger model.

We consider quantum ﬁeld theories with topological sectors, in Euclidean
spacetime. These sectors are characterized by a topological charge Q ∈
Z, which is a functional of the ﬁeld conﬁguration. In inﬁnite volume, the
conﬁgurations with ﬁnite action are divided into these disjoint sectors. The
same property holds in ﬁnite volume with periodic boundary conditions.

2

Examples are O(N) models in d = N − 1 dimensions, all 2d CP(N − 1)
models, 4d SU(N) Yang-Mills gauge theories (N ≥ 2), as well as QCD, and
2d U(1) gauge theory, as well as the Schwinger model. In all these models,
a continuous deformation of a given conﬁguration (at ﬁnite action) can only
lead to conﬁgurations within the same topological sector, i.e. the deformation
cannot alter the topological charge Q.

In light of this deﬁnition, lattice regularized models have in general no
topological sectors — strictly speaking. Nevertheless, it is often useful to
divide the set of lattice ﬁeld conﬁgurations into sectors, which turn into
the topological sectors in the continuum limit. The deﬁnition of a topo-
logical charge on the lattice is somewhat arbitrary.
In presence of chiral
fermions (where the lattice Dirac operator obeys the Ginsparg-Wilson re-
lation), the fermion index provides a sound formulation [1]. For the O(N)
models the geometric deﬁnition [2] is optimal, since it guarantees integer
topological charges on periodic lattices (for all conﬁgurations except for a
subset of measure zero). In gauge theory, ﬁeld theoretic deﬁnitions are of-
ten applied, usually combined with smearing or cooling techniques, see e.g.
Ref. [3]. These techniques are computationally cheap and provide, on ﬁne lat-
tices or at ﬁxed topology, results which agree well with the computationally
demanding fermion index [4–6].

As we proceed to ﬁner and ﬁner lattices, the formulation becomes more
continuum-like, and changing a (suitably deﬁned) topological sector of the
lattice ﬁeld is getting more and more tedious — for this purpose, continuous
deformations have to pass through a statistically suppressed domain of high
Euclidean action. To a large extent, this property persists for ﬁnite but small
deformations, as they are carried out in the Markov chain of a Monte Carlo
simulation which performs small update steps.

In QCD simulations with dynamical quarks, the gauge conﬁgurations
are usually generated with a Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm, with
small updates, on lattices of a spacing a in the range 0.05 fm <
∼ 0.15 fm.
The artifacts due to the ﬁnite lattice spacing tend to be the main source
of systematic errors. Therefore, the lattice community will try to suppress
them further by proceeding to even ﬁner lattices, a < 0.05 fm.

∼ a <

This will provide continuum-like features, which are highly welcome in
general, but as a draw-back it will become harder to change the topological
sector. A HMC simulation may well be trapped in a single sector over a
tremendously long trajectory; in particular, this is the experience in QCD
simulations with dynamical overlap quarks [7].

3

In some circumstances it is even motivated to suppress topological transi-
tions on purpose, in particular when dealing with dynamical chiral fermions.
In that context, conﬁgurations in a transition region cause technical prob-
lems, like a bad condition number of an overlap or domain wall Dirac opera-
tor. This can be avoided by the use of unconventional lattice gauge actions,
known as “topology conserving gauge actions” [4, 8] (see also Ref. [9] for a
very similar formulation).

A further option is the use of a “mixed action”, where one implements
chiral symmetry only for the valence quarks, which requires just a moderate
computational eﬀort. In particular, overlap valence quarks have been com-
bined with Wilson sea quarks. However, in this set-up the continuum limit
is not on safe ground, because (approximate) valence quark zero modes are
not compensated by the sea quark spectrum [10]. This problem might be
avoided by ﬁxing the topological sector particularly to Q = 0.

In such settings, there are obvious questions about the (eﬀective) ergodic-
ity of the algorithm, since the simulation does not sample properly the entire
space of all conﬁgurations. Even if we ignore this conceptual question, in
practice the measurement of an observable may well be distorted. This is
the issue to be addressed in this work.

Section 2 describes the Brower-Chandrasekharan-Negele-Wiese (BCNW)
approach, and Sections 3 and 4 probe it in the 1d O(2) and the 2d O(3)
non-linear σ-model.
It is explored further in 4d SU(2) Yang-Mills theory
in Section 5, and in the Schwinger model in Section 6. The ﬁeld theoretic
models discussed in Sections 4 to 6 share fundamental features with QCD.
Section 7 is devoted to our conclusions.

2 The BCNW method

As a remedy against the topological freezing of Monte Carlo histories, L¨uscher
suggested the use of open boundary conditions, such that the topological
charge can change continuously [11]. This overcomes the problem, but it
breaks translational invariance and one gives up integer topological charges
Q. However, Q ∈ Z provides a valuable link to aspects, which are analytically
known or conjectured in the continuum, for instance regarding the ǫ-regime
of QCD, or properties based on an instanton picture.

In this work we maintain periodic boundary conditions (in some volume
V ) for the bosonic ﬁelds involved, so the topological charges Q are integers.

4

Moreover we consider models with parity invariance. This implies hQi = 0,
and the topological susceptibility is given by

χt =

1
V hQ2i .

(2.1)

In this framework, we are going to test the BCNW approximation [12]. It
can be written in the form of an expansion in inverse powers of V χt,

hOiQ ≃ hOi +

1

V χt

c +

1

(V χt)2 (¯c − c Q2) −

2

(V χt)3 ¯c Q2 .

(2.2)

The left-hand-side refers to the expectation value of some observable O (Refs.
[12] inserted speciﬁcally the pion mass) within the sectors of topological
charges ±Q. It is accessible even in simulations which are conﬁned to one —
or a few — topological sectors.
All the unknown terms on the right-hand-side, i.e. the expectation value
hOi, χt and the coeﬃcients c and ¯c, are quantities that asymptotically sta-
bilize in large volume. Hence this form enables the use of results for hOiQ,
measured in several volumes and for distinct |Q|, to determine these un-
known terms. In particular we are interested in hOi and χt; the coeﬃcients
are determined as well, but their values are hardly of physical interest (for
instance c = 1

Actually the third order in approximation (2.2) is incomplete, but the ad-
ditional term in this order would bring along another free parameter. These
terms are identiﬁed and discussed in detail in Refs. [13–15]. Here we mostly
focus on the simplest form which captures the Q-dependence of hOiQ, and
which involves only three parameters (though an incomplete second order),

2hOi′′(θ)|θ=0).

hOiQ ≈ hOi +

c

V χt (cid:18)1 −

Q2

V χt(cid:19) .

(2.3)

In the following, we will refer to this approximation as the BCNW formula.
Obviously we cannot determine the quantities hOi, χt and c within a single
volume; for instance

hOiQ1 − hOiQ2 ≈

c

(V χt)2 (Q2

2 − Q2
1)

(2.4)

only determines the ratio c/χ2
however, we could use e.g. hOi0(V1)−hOi0(V2) ≈ c

t . If we include diﬀerent volumes V1 and V2,
χt (1/V1−1/V2) to ﬁx c/χt,

5

and we obtain — along with relation (2.4) — all three quantities, hOi, χt
and c (we repeat that only the former two are of interest). In practice one
would rather involve several volumes and topological sectors, and perform a
3-parameter ﬁt to the (over-determined) system.

We distinguish three regimes for the volume V

• Small volume: there are signiﬁcant ﬁnite size eﬀects of the ordinary

type, not related to topology ﬁxing, in particular in hOi and χt.

• Moderate volume: ordinary ﬁnite size eﬀects are negligible (they tend
to be exponentially suppressed), but hOiQ still depends signiﬁcantly
on |Q| and V .

• Large volume: there are hardly any ﬁnite size eﬀects left, even the

correction terms in approximations (2.2), (2.3) are negligible.

In small volumes, the formulae (2.3) and (2.2) cannot be applied, because
results from various volumes cannot be used for the same ﬁt.1 In large vol-
umes, we obtain the correct value for hOi anyhow, without worrying about
frozen topology, as we see from the expansions (2.2) and (2.3). However,
such large volumes may be inaccessible in realistic simulations, due to limi-
tations of the computational resources. Hence we are interested in moderate
volumes, where the determination of hOi is diﬃcult, but possibly feasible by
means of the BCNW approximation. Moreover, that regime also provides an
estimate for χt, which is particularly hard to measure directly.

The derivation of formula (2.2) involves approximations, which assume:2

• hQ2i = V χt is large. As we mentioned before, eq. (2.2) takes the form
of an expansion in 1/hQ2i. Once χt is stable, this can also be viewed
as a large volume expansion.

• |Q|/hQ2i is small, so we should work in the sectors with a small abso-
lute value |Q|. This is less obvious from the formulae (2.2) and (2.3)
1An extension of the BCNW approximation (2.3) including ordinary ﬁnite size eﬀects
has been derived in Refs. [16]. This extension can be used for ﬁts to data obtained from
small volumes. It involves, however, additional ﬁtting parameters.

2For convenience, this formula has been re-derived in Subsection 5.2 of Ref. [17] in a

way, which highlights the rˆole of these two assumptions.

6

(although the terms ∝ Q2 are related to this condition), but it is re-
quired for a step in its derivation, which relies on a stationary phase
approximation.

Here we employ numerical data to explore how large hQ2i has to be for
this approximation to be sensible, and up to which absolute value |Q| the
data are useful in this context. In practice it is rather easy to work at small
|Q|, but the former condition could be a serious obstacle.
So far there have been only few attempts to apply this approximation
to simulation data. This was done for the 2-ﬂavor Schwinger model with
dynamical overlap fermions [17, 18] with respect to the pseudo-scalar mass
Mπ and the chiral condensate Σ. Tests for a quantum rotor — more precisely
a scalar particle on a circle with a potential — are reported in Refs. [13, 14].
Another approach was derived — similarly to the BCNW approximation
— in Ref. [19]. It refers to the long-distance correlation of the topological

charge density q(x), Q = R ddx q(x). The applicability of that method has

been tested in a set of models [20], and variants had been studied previously
[21]. Further approaches to extract physics from topologically frozen Markov
chains include Refs. [22–24]. Preliminary results of this work have been
anticipated in some proceeding contributions [13, 15, 16, 25].

3 Tests for the quantum rotor

As a simple but precise test, we ﬁrst consider a toy model from quantum
mechanics (i.e. 1d quantum ﬁeld theory), namely the quantum rotor, or
1d XY model, or 1d O(2) model. It describes a free quantum mechanical
particle moving on a circle, with a periodicity condition in Euclidean time.
A theoretical discussion of this system, in the continuum and for diﬀerent
lattice actions, is given in Ref. [26].3 Below we write down the continuum
action, and on the lattice the standard action and the Manton action [28] (in

3For the analytic treatment, Ref. [26] uses the Hamiltonian formalism. A discussion in

terms of path integrals is given in Ref. [27].

Lcont and L are the extent of the periodic Euclidean time interval in the
continuum and on the lattice, respectively, ϕ(t) and ϕt are time dependent
angles, with ϕ(Lcont + t) = ϕ(t), ϕL+t = ϕt. βcont and β can be interpreted
as an inverse temperature, or in this case also as the moment of inertia. In
the terms for the lattice actions we deﬁne

∆ϕt = (ϕt+1 − ϕt) mod 2π ∈ (−π, π] ,

(3.2)

i.e. the modulo function is implemented such that it minimizes |∆ϕt|. Thus
∆ϕt also deﬁnes the lattice topological charge density qt (geometric deﬁni-
tion) and the charge Q,

qt =

In the continuum and inﬁnite size Lcont, the correlation length and its

product with the topological susceptibility amount to

ξcont = 2βcont , χt ξcont =

2π2 .

(3.4)

Analytic expressions for the corresponding quantities on the lattice, with the
standard action and the Manton action, are given in Ref. [26].

Our simulations were carried out with the Wolﬀ cluster algorithm [29],
which performs non-local update steps. This algorithm is highly eﬃcient
and provided a statistics of 5 × 109 measurements for each setting. Since it
changes the topological sector frequently, in this case the observables could
also be measured directly to high precision, which allows for a detailed test
of the BCNW method. In most quantum ﬁeld theoretic models no eﬃcient

8

cluster algorithm is known, in particular in the presence of gauge ﬁelds. Then
one has to resort to local update algorithms, which motivates this project,
as we pointed out in Section 1.

For our tests we set β = 4 and consider six lattice sizes in the range
L = 150 . . . 400. This is large compared to the correlation length, which was
measured at L = 400 as

ξstandard = 6.81495(4) ,

ξManton = 7.9989(1) ,

(3.5)

very close to the analytic values at L = ∞. This demonstrates that ordinary
ﬁnite size eﬀects are very small, but — as we are going to see — there are
signiﬁcant ﬁxed topology ﬁnite size eﬀects. Hence we are in the regime of
moderate volumes, as desired. Moreover, this regime is sensible also because
lattice artifacts are quite well suppressed.

The BCNW formula consists of leading terms in an expansion in 1/hQ2i,

cf. Section 1. In the range L = 150 . . . 400 we obtain

hQ2istandard = 1.13 . . . 3.02 ,

hQ2iManton = 0.95 . . . 2.53 .

(3.6)

This suggests that we are in the transition regime to the validity of this
method, which is interesting to explore.

3.1 Action density

We ﬁrst consider the action density

s = hSi/V .

(3.7)

This quantity is not directly physical, but it is suitable for testing the BCNW
method, based on topologically restricted expectation values s|Q| = hSi|Q|/V .
Moreover, the corresponding ﬁts provide a value for χt, which is physical.
Figure 1 shows the action density for both lattice actions under consid-
eration, measured at ﬁxed |Q| = 0 . . . 4, and by including all sectors (the
way the simulation samples them). The latter is constant to high accuracy
for L = 150 . . . 400, which conﬁrms that ordinary ﬁnite size eﬀects are neg-
ligible. On the other hand, at ﬁxed |Q| we see deviations far beyond the
statistical errors, depending on L and |Q|, so this setting is appropriate for
the application of the BCNW method.
Table 1 presents our results obtained by least-square ﬁts to the BCNW
approximation (2.3): we use data for s|Q| in all six volumes, and in the

displays s measured in all sectors at L = 400, and the analytic value of χt at
L = ∞.

Regarding the value of s, the method works perfectly (to the given preci-
sion) for the standard action, and up to a deviation of about 0.006 % for the
Manton action. For the standard action the ﬁts yield values for χt, which are
again compatible with the correct value, with uncertainties around 0.05 %.

10

In case of the Manton action a systematic discrepancy of 3 % is observed, as
a consequence of the approximations in formula (2.3).

In summary, this ﬁrst numerical experiment can be considered a success
of the BCNW method. The good results for s are highly non-trivial in view
of the sizable diﬀerences in the individual sectors (shown in Figure 1), and
exactly these diﬀerences give rise to quite good estimates for χt. As a generic
property, it is easy to measure s|Q| accurately (in gauge theories it is given
by the mean plaquette value), so it is motived to estimate χt in this way also
in higher dimensional models.

3.2 Magnetic susceptibility

In this model, the correlation function in a ﬁxed sector of topological charge
Q has a peculiar form. For a continuous time variable t it reads [14]

h~e(0) · ~e(t)iQ =

(3.8)

The unusual last factor in eq. (3.8) obstructs the determination of a corre-
lation length ξQ6=0, and we recall that the BCNW method does not apply to
results, which are obtained in various volumes, but always at Q = 0.

By integrating over the time shift t, however, we obtain a quantity, which

where ~M = R Lcont

in our case due to the global O(2) invariance, h ~Mi = ~0. The magnetic

interpret a conﬁguration [~e ] as a spin chain. Based on eq. (3.8) we obtain
for its topologically restricted counterpart

χm,|Q| = 2Z Lcont/2
In each sector, the limit Lcont → ∞ leads to χm = χm,|Q| = 4βcont. If we insert

(3.12)

and in this case the third order is complete. If we only consider the second
order and neglect its ¯c-term, we are left with the BCNW approximation (2.3).
Therefore the magnetic susceptibility is fully appropriate for numerical
tests of the validity of this approximation, where we use the corresponding
t=1 ~et. The sources of systematic errors (errors
in the BCNW approximation) are sub-leading ﬁnite size eﬀects and lattice
artifacts.

lattice terms, like ~M = PL

In analogy to Subsection 3.1, Figure 2 gives an overview over the values of
χm,|Q| up to |Q| = 3, at diﬀerent L. Again we see that the value measured in
all sectors is stable in L, whereas the topologically restricted results strongly
depend on L and |Q|. Hence the setting is suitable for the BCNW method
also with respect to the magnetic susceptibility.
We proceed to the ﬁts to search the optimal values — according to formula
(2.3) — for the (over-determined) susceptibilities χm and χt. Table 2 shows
the results in the ﬁtting ranges L = Lmin . . . 400, Lmin = 150, 250, 300, and
|Q| = 0 . . .|Q|max, with |Q|max = 2 or 3.
The ﬁtting results for both susceptibilities are compatible with the cor-
rect values, albeit the uncertainty of χt is rather large. Without knowing the
exact value one could combine the results of separate ﬁts, which reduces the
uncertainty, but it leads to a χt-value which is somewhat too small. On the
other hand, for χm the values are far more precise, and the relative uncer-
tainty is on the percent level (or below) in each case. Here a combination
which reduces the uncertainty is welcome, although it has to be done with
care since the partial results are not independent of each other. We add that

the ﬁtting results for the coeﬃcient c are consistent with eq. (3.12), c ≃ 1.6,
within (considerable) uncertainties.
The observed precisions for χm and χt can be understood if we consider
the impact of the sub-leading contributions, which are missing in the BCNW
formula (2.3): taking into account the additional terms up to the incomplete
third order modiﬁes the ﬁtting results for χm only on the permille level, but
those for χt in O(10) %, both with somewhat enhanced errors. Also a variety
of further ﬁtting variants, with the terms of a complete second or complete

13

third order of approximation (3.11), with ﬁxed or free additional terms, leads
to consistent results for χm and χt, but with enlarged errors. In summary,
there seems to be no ﬁtting strategy which improves the results compared to
the simple 3-parameter ﬁt based on the BCNW approximation (2.3).

4 Applications to the 2d Heisenberg model

Our study of the 2d Heisenberg model, or 2d O(3) model, uses quadratic
lattices of unit spacing and square-shaped volumes V = L × L. On each
lattice site x there is a classical spin ~ex ∈ S2, and we implement periodic
boundary conditions in both directions. We consider the standard lattice
action as well as the constraint action [30],

(1 − ~ex · ~ex+ˆµ) ,

S[~e ]standard = βXx,µ
S[~e ]constraint = (cid:26) 0

where δ is the constraint angle, and ˆµ is the unit vector in µ-direction.

Our simulations were performed at β = 1.5 and δ = 0.55 π, respectively,

with the correlation lengths

constraint action (L = 96)

: ξ = 9.42(2) ,
: ξ = 3.58(5) .

(4.2)
The cluster algorithm allowed us to perform O(107) measurements at each
lattice size shown in Figures 3 and 4.
For the topological charge we use again a geometric deﬁnition [2]. To this
end, each plaquette is split into two triangles, in alternating orientation. We
consider the oriented solid angle of the spins at the corners of a triangle: the
sum of the two angles (divided by 4π) within a plaquette (associated with
the site x) amounts to its topological charge density qx. Due to the periodic

boundary conditions, their sum must be an integer, Q = Px qx ∈ Z. Details

and explicit formulae are given in Refs. [20, 30].

4.1 Action density

A study of the BCNW formula with respect to the action density (3.7) can
only be performed with the standard action (in case of the constraint action

14

all contributing conﬁgurations have action Sconstraint = 0). Figure 3 shows the
values of s and s|Q|, |Q| ≤ 2 in the range L = 32 . . . 84. The total expectation
value s is stable within 0.0003 for L ≥ 56, while the topologically constrained
results diﬀer by O(10−3) even at L = 84. Therefore L = 56 . . . 84 is a regime
of moderate volumes, which is suitable for testing the BCNW formula.

the standard lattice action, in the sectors with topological charge |Q| = 0, 1,
2, and summed over all sectors (i.e. all conﬁgurations used for the numerical
measurements). The latter stabilizes to 0.3 permille for L ≥ 56.

The ﬁtting results, for |Q| ≤ 2 and various ranges of L are listed in Table
3. The ﬁts do not match the BCNW formula perfectly, as expected, since
the latter is an approximation, and the input data have very small statistical
errors of O(10−5).5 Nevertheless, the value of s is obtained correctly up to a
high precision of 0.2 permille. On the other hand, the determination of the
topological susceptibility is less successful; only the ﬁt with L = 76 and 84
yields a result, which is correct within the errors.

5Of course, the ratio χ2/d.o.f. could be reduced by adding more terms to the 1/V -
expansion. However, in Table 4 we are going to demonstrate that this does not improve
the results for the observable and for χt, in qualitative agreement with Section 3.

4.2 Magnetic susceptibility and correlation length

We proceed to the constraint action (4.1) where our choice of δ yields a
shorter correlation length, which favors the stabilization of observables (mea-
sured in all sectors) at smaller L. This can be seen in Figure 4, which shows
the magnetic susceptibility χm, analogous to eq. (3.9) (again the disconnected
part vanishes due to rotational symmetry), and the correlation length ξ. Sta-
bilization within the errors is attained for χm at L ≥ 48 (with errors around
0.2 permille), and for ξ already at L ≥ 16 (with errors of O(1) %). On the
other hand, for L = 128 the χm,|Q|-values are not distinguished anymore from
χm beyond the errors, and the same happens for ξ|Q| already at L = 96. Fi-
nally, we have to exclude L = 16, because here we only obtain hQ2i ≃ 0.63,
hence its inverse is not suitable as an expansion parameter. This singles out
the regime of moderate volumes, where the BCNW formula is appropriate,
to the range L = 48 . . . 96 for χm, and L = 32 . . . 64 for ξ.

Our ﬁtting results are given in Table 4. In the case of χm we probe the
BCNW formula (2.3) (with its incomplete second order, O(1/V 2)), as well
as its extensions to the second order plus an incomplete third order as given
in formula (2.2). For the latter option, the approximation is more precise,
but an additional free parameter ¯c hampers the ﬁts.

For both ﬁtting versions, the results for χm and χt are compatible with the
directly measured values. We observe, however, that the inclusion of terms
beyond the BCNW formula enhances the uncertainty (due to the additional
ﬁtting parameter). The uncertainty is on the permille level for χm, but large
for χt, in particular with extra terms. (Without these terms it is around

results in Table 4 are correct, within percent level for ξ, but again with a
large uncertainty of the χt-value.

We add that we also tried ﬁts to the complete second order approximation,
without the third order term that appears in formula (2.2). However, this
scenario (which also involves the ﬁtting parameter ¯c) is clearly unfavorable:
in this case, it often happens that the least-square ﬁt even fails to converge
to values in the correct magnitude.

To conclude, this study suggests that the simple BCNW formula, with
only three free parameters, is in fact optimal for extracting values for the
considered observable, and for χt. Moreover, we conﬁrm that the method
works best for the determination of the observable; it is less successful with
respect to the determination of χt.

to remove local ﬂuctuations in the gauge conﬁgurations, while preserving the
topological structure.

A cooling sweep amounts to a local minimization of the action, i.e. a

minimization we use again an improved lattice Yang-Mills action,

where W (✷×✷)
[U] is a clover averaged loop of size ✷× ✷ with the coeﬃcients
c✷ given above (for comparison, the standard plaquette action corresponds
to (c1, c2, c3) = (1, 0, 0)). Choosing an appropriate number of cooling sweeps
is a subtle and somewhat ambiguous task, which is carried out for each gauge
conﬁguration one by one. After every cooling sweep we compute Q[U] ac-
cording to eq. (5.3). As soon as Q[U] is stable (it varies by less than 10 % and
is close to an integer for at least 50 cooling sweeps), the corresponding close
integer is the topological charge that we assign to the gauge conﬁguration
[U]. Figure 5 shows examples for typical cooling histories of gauge conﬁgu-
rations with Q = 0, 1 and 2. (Details of this procedure, and a comparison
to other deﬁnitions of the topological charge, are discussed in Ref. [6].)

Our simulations were performed with a heatbath algorithm, see e.g. Ref.
[31]. We set β = 2.5, which corresponds to a lattice spacing a ≈ 0.073 fm,
if the scale is set with the QCD Sommer parameter r0 = 0.46 fm [32]. This
value is in the range of lattice spacings 0.05 fm <
∼ 0.15 fm typically used
in contemporary QCD simulations. We generated gauge conﬁgurations in
lattice volumes V = L4, with L = 12, 14, 15, 16, 18.6
In each volume,
observables were measured on 4000 conﬁgurations, separated by 100 heatbath
sweeps. This guarantees their statistical independence; in particular, even
the auto-correlation time with respect to the topological charge Q is below
20 heatbath sweeps.

5.2 Computation of observables
The observable we focus on is the static quark-antiquark potential Vq ¯q(r) for
separations r = 1, 2 . . . 6. This quantity can be interpreted as the mass of a
static-static meson. To determine Vq ¯q(r), we consider temporal correlation
functions of operators

Oq ¯q(r) = ¯q(~r1) U APE(~r1, ~r2) q(~r2) ,

r = |~r1 − ~r2| ,

(5.5)

where ¯q, q represent spinless static quarks, while U APE(~r1, ~r2) denotes a prod-
uct of APE smeared spatial links [34] along a straight line connecting the
lattice sites ~r1 and ~r2 on a given time slice. For the quarks we use the HYP2
static action, which is designed to reduce UV ﬂuctuations and, therefore, to
improve the signal-to-noise ratio [33]. These temporal correlation functions
can be simpliﬁed analytically resulting in Wilson loop averages hW (r, t)i with

6Unless stated otherwise, we continue using lattice units.

APE smeared spatial and HYP2 smeared temporal lines of length r and t,
respectively. Thus we arrive at the vacuum expectation value

hΩ|O†

¯qq(t)O¯qq(0)|Ωi ∝ DW (r, t)E .

(5.6)

We chose the APE smearing parameters as NAPE = 15 and αAPE = 0.5,
which (roughly) optimizes the overlap of O¯qq|Ωi with the ground state of the
static potential (for details of the smearing procedure we refer to Ref. [35],
where a similar setup had been used).

5.3 Numerical results

5.3.1 The static potential

Figure 6 shows results for the static potential measured in all topological
sectors, i.e. for each r and t the Wilson loop average is computed on all
conﬁgurations, which are available in some volume.7 The volumes 144, 154,
164 and 184 yield identical results within statistical errors, but the static po-
tential in the 124 volume diﬀers by several σ for quark-antiquark separations
r ≥ 3. We conclude that V = 124 entails sizable ordinary ﬁnite volume
eﬀects (not associated with topology ﬁxing), whereas for volumes V ≥ 144
such ordinary ﬁnite volume eﬀects are negligible. Consequently, we do not
use the 124 lattice in the following ﬁxed topology studies.8

For V = 154, Figure 7 demonstrates that static potentials obtained at
ﬁxed topology from diﬀerent sectors |Q| = 0 . . . 5 (by averaging only over
conﬁgurations of a ﬁxed charge |Q|), Vq ¯q,|Q|, diﬀer signiﬁcantly.9 For ex-
ample Vq ¯q,0(r = 6) and Vq ¯q,4(r = 6) diﬀer by more than 6σ. They are
also well distinct from the corresponding result in all sectors, Vq ¯q,|Q|≤1(6) <
Vq ¯q(6) < Vq ¯q,|Q|≥2(6). These observations show that V = 144 . . . 184 is in
the regime that we denoted as moderate volumes (cf. Section 2), where the
BCNW method is appropriate to extract observables from ﬁxed topology
measurements. Similar results for the static potential in SU(3) Yang-Mills
theory have been reported in Ref. [4].

7As usual, we determined Vq ¯q(r) by searching for a plateau value of the eﬀective mass

measurement, in agreement with the ﬁxed topology study in Ref. [20].
Moreover, we checked that the resulting ﬁt parameters are stable within
errors when we vary tmin and tmax by ±1.

• The results for hWV (r, t)i|Q| entering the ﬁt are restricted to those |Q|
and V values for which 1/(χtV ), |Q|/(χtV ) < 1 or < 0.5; we recall
that the approximations (5.7) and (5.8) are only valid for suﬃciently
large χtV = hQ2i, and small |Q|. To implement this selection we insert
χt = 7 × 10−5 [3]; Table 5 gives an overview.

23

• We either perform a single combined ﬁt to all considered separations
r = 1 . . . 6, or six separate ﬁts, one for each r. In the latter case we
obtain six results for χt, which agree within the errors in most cases,
cf. Subsection 5.3.2.

Table 6 collects the results for Vq ¯q(r) from ﬁxed topology computations
(using four volumes, V = 144, 154, 164, 184), and computed in all sectors at
V = 184. There is agreement between most of these results within about 2σ.
Only for r = 1, and the relaxed constraint 1/(χtV ), |Q|/(χtV ) < 1, there
are a few cases with discrepancies beyond 3σ, in particular for the expansion
(5.7) (the corresponding data in Table 6 are displayed in italics).

The extent of the errors of the ﬁtting results is fairly independent of the
choice of the expansion ((5.7), or (5.8), or (5.8) with χt = 7 × 10−5 ﬁxed).
The errors increase, however, by factors up to ≈ 2, when we implement the
stringent constraint 1/(χtV ), |Q|/(χtV ) < 0.5, which is expected, since less
input data are involved, see Table 5. All ﬁts of the expansions (5.7) and (5.8)
capture well the ﬁxed topology results.

For the extraction of the potential it seems essentially irrelevant whether
a single combined ﬁt or six separate ﬁts are performed. Both the mean
values and the statistical errors of Vq ¯q(r) are in most cases very similar. A
single combined ﬁt, however, seems somewhat advantageous regarding the
determination of χt, see Subsection 5.3.2.

Figure 8 compares the static potential obtained from ﬁxed topology Wil-
son loops, and computed without topology ﬁxing at V = 184. As reﬂected
by Table 6 there is excellent agreement within the errors.

The expansion (5.7) of ﬁxed topology Wilson loop averages hWV (r, t)i|Q|
is a decaying exponential in t. This suggests to deﬁne a static potential at
ﬁxed topological charge |Q| and volume V ,

Vq ¯q,|Q|,V (r) = −

d
dt

ln(cid:16)DWV (r, t)E|Q|(cid:17)

(5.9)

for some value of t, where formula (5.7) is a rather precise approximation.
Within statistical errors Vq ¯q,|Q|,V (r) is independent of t for tmin ≤ t ≤ tmax.
Therefore, we determine Vq ¯q,|Q|,V (r) by a χ2 minimizing ﬁt of a constant
to the right-hand-side of eq. (5.9), with the derivative replaced by a ﬁnite
diﬀerence (this is the common deﬁnition of an eﬀective mass) in the interval
tmin ≤ t ≤ tmax. For |Q| = 0 . . . 4 and V = 144, 154, 164, 184, the values for
Vq ¯q,|Q|,V (r = 6) are plotted in Figure 9. As already shown in Figure 7, there

shown in Figure 9. One clearly sees that approximation (5.10) nicely de-
scribes the numerical results for Vq ¯q,|Q|,V (r = 6).
We conclude that one can obtain a correct and accurate physical static
potential from Wilson loops separately computed in diﬀerent topological sec-
tors. The errors are larger by factors ≈ 2 . . . 5 (cf. Table 6) for a ﬁxed topol-
ogy computation using four ensembles, compared to a corresponding direct
computation using a single ensemble (V = 184).

5.3.2 The topological susceptibility

In Table 7 we present results for the topological susceptibility extracted from
ﬁxed topology Wilson loops hWV (r, t)i|Q|. Again we use the 1/V expansions
(5.7) or (5.8), the constraints 1/(χtV ), |Q|/(χtV ) < 1 or < 0.5, and either a
single combined ﬁt to all considered separations r = 1 . . . 6, or six separate
ﬁts, one for each r. The latter yields six diﬀerent results for χt.

Not all of the extracted χt values perfectly agree with each other or with
the result χt = (7.0 ± 0.9) × 10−5 from Ref. [3], which we take as a refer-
ence. Using the weak constraint 1/(χtV ), |Q|/(χtV ) < 1 there seems to be
a slight tension in form of ≈ 2σ discrepancies, when performing ﬁts with
formula (5.7). The extended expansion (5.8) gives somewhat better results:
no tension shows up, and most results agree with the reference value within
σ.

One might hope for further improvement by using the stronger constraint
1/(χtV ), |Q|/(χtV ) < 0.5, since then formulae (5.7) and (5.8) are more ac-
curate. Indeed this leads to consistency with the reference value, but in most
cases the errors are very large, of the order of 100 % or even more. For this

computations of the static potential Vq ¯q(r) for various separations r = 1 . . . 6.
In the column “method” the equation number of the expansion is listed,
“c” denotes a single combined ﬁt for all separations r = 1 . . . 6, and “s”
denotes a separate ﬁt for each separation. The reference value from a direct
computation is χt × 105 = (7.0 ± 0.9) [3].

strong constraint the available Vq ¯q,|Q|-data are not suﬃcient to extract a use-
ful result for χt. Note that here the error for one combined ﬁt is signiﬁcantly
smaller than those for the separate ﬁts.

We conclude that — in principle — one can extract the topological sus-
ceptibility in Yang-Mills theory from the static potential at ﬁxed topology
using formulae like (5.7) or (5.8). In practice, however, one needs precise data
in several large volumes. Only when a variation of the input data (e.g. by us-
ing diﬀerent bounds with respect to 1/(χtV ), |Q|/(χtV )) leads to precise and
stable χt values, one should consider the result trustworthy. The data used in
this work are not suﬃcient to achieve this standard. As we mentioned before,
more promising methods to determine χt from simulations at ﬁxed topology
using the same lattice setup have recently been explored [20–22, 24].

6 Results in the Schwinger model

6.1 Simulation setup

We ﬁnally proceed to the Schwinger model — or 2d Quantum Electrody-
namics — as a test model with dynamical fermions. This model has the
continuum Lagrangian

Lcont(ψ, ¯ψ, A) =

Nf

Xf=1

¯ψ(f)(cid:16)γµ(∂µ + igcontAµ) + m(f)(cid:17)ψ(f) +

1
4

FµνFµν ,

(6.1)

where Nf is the number of fermion ﬂavors. It is a widely used toy model,
which shares important features with QCD. In particular the U(1) gauge the-
ory in two (spacetime) dimensions allows for topologically non-trivial gauge
conﬁgurations, similar to instantons in 4d Yang-Mills theories and in QCD.
The topological charge is given by

Q[A] =

1

π Z d2x ǫµνFµν .

(6.2)

Moreover, for Nf = 2 the low lying energy eigenstates contain a light iso-
triplet composed of quasi Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which we are going to
denote as “pions”. This model also exhibits fermion conﬁnement.

We simulated the Schwinger model on periodic lattices of volume V =
L × L (as before we use lattice units), with Nf = 2 mass degenerate ﬂavors.
They are represented by Wilson fermions, and we use the standard plaquette
gauge action (see e.g. Ref. [36]).

One can approach the continuum limit by increasing L, while keeping the
terms gL and MπL ﬁxed, where Mπ denotes the pion mass.10 This requires
decreasing both g and Mπ proportional to 1/L (for the latter the fermion
mass has to be adjusted). It is also common to refer to β = 1/g2, in analogy
to the previous sections.

As in Sections 3 and 4, we employ a geometric deﬁnition of the topological

charge on the lattice [37],

Q[U] =

1

2π XP

φ(P ) ,

(6.3)

10In physical units, g has the dimension of a mass, so these products are both dimen-

sionless. This also introduces a dimensional lattice spacing a ∝ g.

29

where PP denotes the sum over all plaquettes P = eiφ(P ), −π < φ(P ) ≤ π.
With this deﬁnition, Q ∈ Z holds for any stochastic gauge conﬁguration.
We performed simulations at various values of β, m and L using the HMC
algorithm of Ref. [38], with multiple timescale integration and mass precon-
ditioning [39]. We started with rather short simulations (≈ 50 000 . . . 100 000
HMC trajectories) on small lattices (L = 8 . . . 28), to investigate the transi-
tion probability between topological sectors per HMC trajectory. This prob-
ability is plotted in Figure 10, as a function of g = 1/√β and m/g, while
gL = 24/√5 is kept constant. (The ratio m/g is proportional to the bare
fermion mass in physical units.) As expected, topological transitions are fre-
quent at large couplings g (coarse lattices), whereas at weak coupling (ﬁne
lattices) topology freezing is observed. Such a freezing is also observed in
QCD, which is the main motivation of this work. We see that the depen-
dence of the transition probability on the ratio m/g, and therefore on the
dimensional bare fermion mass, is rather weak.

units) at gL = 24/√5 (ﬁxed dimensional volume and coupling constant).

Similar to the previous two sections we now explore the possibility to
extract physical energy levels (the “hadron” masses in the Schwinger model)
from simulations at ﬁxed topology. To obtain such results with small statis-

30

tical errors, we focused on a single coupling and a single “quark” mass,

β = 4 , m = 0.1 ,

(6.4)

and we performed long simulations (≈ 500 000 HMC trajectories) for volumes
V = L × L, with L = 40, 44 , 48 , 52 , 56 , 60.

6.2 Computation of observables

We determine the topological charge Q[U] for each gauge conﬁguration U
according to deﬁnition (6.3). (To measure observables at ﬁxed topological
charge ν, we only use the conﬁgurations with Q[U] = ν.)

The hadron masses that we investigate are the static potential V¯qq(r),
which has been discussed before in Yang-Mills theory (Subsection 5.2), and
the pion mass Mπ. A suitable pion creation operator reads

Oπ = Xx

¯ψ(u)
x γ3ψ(d)
x

,

(6.5)

where u and d label the two (degenerate) fermion ﬂavors.11 For the static
potential we use again

Oq ¯q = ¯q(r1)U(r1; r2)q(r2) ,

r = |r1 − r2| .

(6.6)

Also here ¯q and q represent spinless static fermions and U(r1; r2) denotes the
product of spatial links connecting the lattice sites r1 and r2 on a given time
slice. Since there is only one spatial dimension, we do not apply any gauge
link smearing.

6.3 Numerical results

for some value of t, where approximation (5.7) is quite precise. Within statis-
tical errors, Mπ,|Q|,V is independent of t for large t. Therefore, we determine
Mπ,|Q|,V by a χ2 minimizing ﬁt of a constant to the right-hand-side of eq.
(6.7) (with the derivative replaced by a ﬁnite diﬀerence).

Figure 11 shows that pion masses obtained at ﬁxed topology in diﬀerent
topological sectors, Mπ,|Q|, diﬀer signiﬁcantly at V = 402. For example Mπ,0
and Mπ,3 diﬀer by more than 6σ. The physically meaningful value measured
in all sectors, Mπ, also deviates e.g. from Mπ,0 by more than 7σ. Figure 11
demonstrates also here the necessity to analytically assemble ﬁxed topol-
ogy results, when the Monte Carlo algorithm is unable to generate frequent
changes in Q.

To determine the pion mass and the static potential from correlation func-
tions evaluated in single topological sectors, Mπ,|Q| and Vq ¯q,|Q|, we follow the
lines of Section 5. We perform least-square ﬁts using expansion (5.7) or (5.8)
of the correlation functions. We choose a suitable ﬁtting range tmin . . . tmax,
which typically leads to χ2/d.o.f. <
∼ 1. The stability of the resulting Mπ,|Q|
and Vq ¯q,|Q| has been checked by varying tmin and tmax by ±1. The t ranges
used for the determination of the pion mass are listed in Table 8.
We perform ﬁts in three diﬀerent ways: (“c”) a single combined ﬁt to

(“cV”) a single combined ﬁt to the four static potential observables; (“s”) ﬁve
separate ﬁts, one to each of the ﬁve observables. The results are collected in
Table 9, along with reference values obtained in all sectors at V = 602.12

The conclusions are essentially the same as for Yang-Mills theory dis-
cussed in Section 5. Results extracted indirectly, from simulations at ﬁxed
topology, are in agreement with those obtained directly. The magnitude of
the errors is the same for the two expansions (5.7) and (5.8), and for the
ﬁtting methods “c”, “cV” and “s”. They are, however, larger by factors of
≈ 2 when we use the stringent constraint 1/(χtV ), |Q|/(χtV ) < 0.5, since
less input data are involved compared to 1/(χtV ), |Q|/(χtV ) < 1. The ﬁts
all yield uncorrelated χ2/d.o.f. <
∼ 1, indicating that the ﬁxed topology results
are well described by both formulae (5.7) and (5.8).

For |Q| = 0 . . . 4 and V = 402 . . . 602, the Mπ,|Q|,V values are plotted in
Figure 12. Again we observe a strong dependence on the topological sector,
in particular in small volumes. From the expansion (5.7), Mπ,|Q|,V is expected
to behave as approximation (2.3),

yields Mπ ≃ 0.343.

We conclude, similar to our study in Yang-Mills theory, that it is possible
to extract correct and accurate values for the pion mass and the static po-
tential from correlation functions computed in a number of ﬁxed topological
sectors and volumes. The errors are somewhat larger than for direct compu-
tation, in our case by factors of ≈ 2 . . . 7. This is partly due to the smaller
amount of gauge conﬁgurations of the ﬁxed Q ensembles at diﬀerent V , and
partly due to the extrapolation to inﬁnite volume.

6.3.2 The topological susceptibility

Table 10 presents results for the topological susceptibility extracted from
our data for Mπ,|Q| and Vq ¯q,|Q|. These values for χt are obtained from the
same ﬁts, which lead to the results in Table 9. The results for χt and their
interpretation are similar to those obtained in Yang-Mills theory. We observe
a slight tension of ≈ 2σ for some values, when using expansion (5.7) and
the relaxed constraint (1/(χtV ),|Q|/(χtV ) < 1). This tension disappears
when we apply the improved expansion (5.8). When imposing the strict

35

constraint (1/χtV, |Q|/χtV < 0.5), we encounter the same problem as in
Subsection 5.3.2: all results are in agreement with the directly measured
χt = hQ2i/V (at V = 602), but the errors are very large.13

Table 10: Results for the topological susceptibility χt, directly measured (at
V = 602), and based on ﬁxed topology computations of Mπ,|Q| and Vq ¯q,|Q|(r)
for separations r = 1, 2, 3, 4. In the column “method” the equation num-
ber of the expansion is listed, “c” denotes a single combined ﬁt to all ﬁve
observables, “cV” means a single combined ﬁt to the four static potential
observables, and “s” denotes a separate ﬁt to each of the ﬁve observables.

We infer that a reasonably accurate determination of the topological sus-
ceptibility from Mπ,|Q| and Vq ¯q,|Q| requires extremely precise input data. The
ﬁxed topology ensembles and correlation functions of this work are not suf-
ﬁcient to extract an accurate and stable value for χt.

13Ref. [42] presents results for χt in the 2-ﬂavor Schwinger model with staggered and
overlap fermions, with or without link smearing. The results at β = 4 and m = 0.1 (in
large volume) are in the range χt ≃ 0.044 . . . 0.064. This agrees with our value in Table 10,
which conﬁrms the mild renormalization of our bare fermion mass (cf. footnote 12).

7 Conclusions

We have systematically explored the applicability of the Brower-Chandra-
sekharan-Negele-Wiese (BCNW) method [12] with lattice data in ﬁxed topo-
logical sectors. Our study encompasses the quantum rotor, the Heisenberg
model, 4d SU(2) Yang-Mills theory and the 2-ﬂavor Schwinger model. The
originally suggested application to the pion mass has been extended to other
observables, like the magnetic susceptibility and the static quark-antiquark
potential.

The primary goal of this method is the determination of a physical ob-
servable if only ﬁxed topology results are available. Our observations show
that this can be achieved to a good precision with input data from various
volumes and topological sectors, which obey the (rather relaxed) constraint
1/(χtV ), |Q|/(χtV ) < 1. Hence this method is promising for application in
QCD, where lattice spacings below a ≃ 0.05 fm are expected to conﬁne HMC
simulations to a single topological sector over extremely long trajectories.
As a second goal, this method also enables — in principle — the deter-
mination of the topological susceptibility χt. In our study we obtained the
right magnitude also for χt, but the results were usually plagued by large un-
certainties. For this purpose, i.e. for the measurement of χt based on ﬁxed
topology simulation results, other methods are more appropriate, based on
the topological charge density correlation [19–21], or on an analysis of χt in
sub-volumes [22, 24].

Regarding the optimal way to apply this method, it seems — for lattice
data of typical statistical precision — not really helpful to add additional
terms of the 1/(χtV ) expansion, beyond the incomplete second order that
was suggested in Ref. [12]. Higher terms were elaborated in Ref. [14], and
they improve the agreement with the ﬁxed topology lattice data, but due to
the appearance of additional free parameters they hardly improve the results
for the physical observable and for χt.

A step beyond, which deserves being explored in more detail, is the inclu-
sion of ordinary ﬁnite size eﬀects (not related to topology ﬁxing) [16], which
even allows for the use of small volumes (in the terminology of Section 2).

At this point, we recommend the application of the simple formulae (2.3)
and (5.7) or (slightly better) (5.8), with only three free parameters, for the
determination of hadron masses in QCD on ﬁne lattices, in particular in the
presence of very light quarks.
