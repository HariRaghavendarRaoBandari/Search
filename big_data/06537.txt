Critical Test Of Gamma Ray Burst Theories

Department of Physics and Space Research Institute, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel

Shlomo Dado and Arnon Dar

Long and precise follow-up measurements of the X-ray afterglow (AG) of very intense gamma ray
bursts (GRBs) provide a critical test of GRB afterglow theories. Here we show that the power-law
decline with time of X-ray AG of GRB 130427A, the longest measured X-ray AG of an intense
GRB with the Swift, Chandra and XMM Newton satellites, and of all other well measured late-time
X-ray afterglow of intense GRBs, is that predicted by the cannonball (CB) model of GRBs from
their measured spectral index, while it disagrees with that predicted by the widely accepted ﬁreball
(FB) models of GRBs.

PACS numbers: 98.70.Rz, 98.38.Fs

Introduction: Gamma-ray bursts are brief ﬂashes of
gamma rays lasting between few milliseconds and several
hours [1] from extremely energetic cosmic explosions [2].
They are usually followed by a longer-lived ”afterglow”
emitted mainly at longer wavelengths [3] (X-ray, ultra-
violet, optical, infrared, microwave and radio). Roughly
they fall into two classes, long duration ones (GRBs) that
last more than ∼ 2 seconds, and short hard bursts (SHBs)
that typically last less than ∼ 2 seconds [4]. The GRBs
seem to be the beamed radiation emitted by highly rela-
tivistic jets [5] ejected in supernova explosions of type Ic
[6], following collapse of rapidly rotating stripped enve-
lope high mass stars to form a neutron star, quark star,
or black hole. The origin of SHBs is not known yet,
but it is widely believed to be highly relativistic jets pre-
sumably emitted in a phase transition in/of a compact
star (white dwarf, neutron star or quark star) to a more
compact state following cooling and loss of angular mo-
mentum, or in merger of compact stars in close binaries
due to gravitational wave emission [7].

In the past two decades, two theoretical models of
GRBs and their afterglows that are based on the above
origin of GRBs, the ﬁreball (FB) model [8] and the can-
nonball (CB) model [9], have been used extensively to
interpret the mounting observational data on GRBs and
their afterglows. Both models were claimed to describe
successfully the observational data. But, despite their
similar names, the two models were and still are entirely
diﬀerent in their assumptions and predictions (compare,
e.g., [10] and [11]). Hence, at most, only one of them can
provide a correct physical description of GRBs and their
afterglows.

But, GRBs and their afterglows are very diverse and
complex astrophysical phenomena, which depend on a
variety of physical parameters whose unknown values
change from GRB to GRB. These unknown values are
usually treated in GRB models as free parameters, which
are adjusted to best ﬁt the observational data. As a re-
sult, when successful ﬁts to observational data were ob-
tained, it was not clear whether they were due to the
validity of the theory or the use of several free adjustable
parameters. Scientiﬁc theories, however, must be falsi-
ﬁable [12]. Hence, only confrontation of key predictions

of GRB models, which are free of adjustable parame-
ters, with accurate observational data can serve as criti-
cal tests of GRB models.

A key prediction of both the colimated FB and CB
models of GRBs that can be used for a critical test of
these models is their predicted relation between the spec-
tral index and the temporal decay of the synchrotron
afterglow of GRBs that in both models decays at late
time like a single power-law. Speciﬁcally, in both mod-
els the predicted temporal decay index depends only on
the spectral index of the measured synchrotron afterglow.
This dependence is diﬀerent in the two models, both for a
constant or a wind-like circumburst density proﬁle. But,
usually the errors in the measured spectral and temporal
decay indices of the late time afterglow, when available,
are not small enough, and/or the circumburst density is
not smooth enough, as evident from small deviations of
the afterglow light-curve from a simple power-law decline,
to allow a decisive test of the models. Recently, how-
ever, the X-ray afterglow of GRB 130427A, the bright-
est gamma-ray burst detected in the last 30 years, was
measured with a high precision by the sensitive X-ray
observatories Chandra and XMM Newton for a record-
breaking baseline longer than 80 million seconds, which
allows a critical test of the standard FB model and the
CB model. While the measured afterglow challenges the
FB model relation for either a wind-like or a constant
inter stellar medium (ISM) density proﬁle [13], here we
show that the CB model relation is in excellent agreement
with the combined data from Swift XRT [14], Chandra
and XMM Newton [13] on the X-ray afterglow of GRB
130427A. Moreover, we show that the CB model relation
is also satisﬁed well by the late time X-ray afterglows
of all the 28 most intense GRBs with known redshift z,
whose late-time afterglow was well measured.

The X-ray Afterglow In The CB Model: In the CB model
[9], GRBs and their afterglows are produced by the in-
teraction of bipolar jets of highly relativistic plasmoids
(CBs) of ordinary matter with the radiation and matter
along their trajectory [5]. Such jetted CBs are presum-
ably ejected in accretion episodes on the newly formed
compact stellar object in stripped envelope core-collapse
supernova (SN) explosions, in the merger of compact ob-

jects in close binary systems, in mass accretion episodes
in microquasars, and in phase transitions in compact
stars.

The circumburst medium in front of a CB moving with
a highly relativistic bulk motion Lorentz factor γ ≫ 1 is
completely ionized by the CB’s radiation. In the CB’s
rest frame, the ions of the medium that are swept in
generate within the CB turbulent magnetic ﬁelds whose
energy density is assumed to be in approximate equipar-
tition with that of the impinging particles. The elec-
trons that enter the CB with a relative Lorentz factor
γ ′
e(t) = γ(t) in the CB’s rest frame are Fermi acceler-
ated there and cool by emission of synchrotron radiation
(SR), which is isotropic in the CB’s rest frame and has a
smoothly broken power-law. In the observer frame, the
emitted photons are beamed into a narrow cone along the
CB’s direction of motion by its highly relativistic motion,
their arrival times are aberrated, and their energies are
boosted by its Doppler factor δ and redshifted by the cos-
mic expansion during their travel time to the observer.
For γ2 ≫ 1 and a viewing angle θ2 ≪ 1 relative to the CB
motion, the Doppler factor satisﬁes δ ≈ 2 γ/[1 + θ2 γ2].
The observed spectral energy density (SED) of the
unabsorbed synchrotron X-rays has the form (see, e.g.,
Eq. (29) in [10])

Fν ∝ n(βx+1)/2 [γ(t)]3 βx−1 [δ(t)]βx+3 ν−βx ,

(1)

where the spectral index βx of the emitted radiation is
related to the photon spectral index Γx of the unabsorbed
X-ray afterglow by βx = Γx − 1. For a constant density,
Γx and βx stay constant as function of time.
The swept-in ionized material decelerates the CB mo-
tion. Energy-momentum conservation for such a plastic
collision between a CB of a baryon number NB , a radius
R and an initial Lorentz factor γ(0) ≫ 1, which propa-
gates in an ISM of a constant density n at a redshift z
yields the deceleration law (Eq. (4) in [15])

γ(t) =

γ0

[p(1 + θ2 γ2

0 )2 + t/td − θ2 γ2

0 ]1/2

,

(2)

where t is the time in the observer frame since the begin-
ning of the afterglow and td = (1+z) NB/8 c n π R2 γ3
0 is
the deceleration time-scale.

As can be seen from Eqs. (1) and (2), for a constant-
density ISM, the shape of the AG light-curve depends on
three parameters: the product γ0 θ, the deceleration time
scale td, and the spectral index βx(t). As long as t<
∼tb =
(1 + θ2 γ2
0 )2 td, γ(t) and consequently also δ(t) change
rather slowly with t and generate the plateau phase of
Fν (t), which lasts until, t ≈ tb. Well beyond the break
time tb, Eqs. (1),(2) yield δ(t) ≈ γ(t) ∝ t−1/4, which
results in a power-law decline of the late-time SED,

Fν (t) ∝ [γ(t)](4 βx+2) ν−βx ∝ t−αx ν−βx

where

αx = βx + 1/2 = Γx − 1/2.

GRB 060729
(0.3-10 keV)

↓tb

FIG. 1: The 0.3-10keV X-ray light-curve of GRB 060729 that
was measured with the Swift XRT [14] and its best ﬁt CB
model light-curve [15]. The late time afterglow as measured
with the Swift XRT between 1.5 × 105 − 1.5 × 107 had a
photon spectral index Γx = 1.99 ± 0.07 [14], which yields
αx = Γx − 1/2 = 1.49 ± 0.07, in good agreement with the best
ﬁt [14] late-time temporal decline index αx = 1.46 ± 0.025.

Such a canonical behavior of the X-ray afterglow of GRBs
(which was predicted by the CB model [16] long before
its empirical discovery with Swift [17]), is demonstrated
in Figure 1 where the 0.3-10 keV X-ray light-curve of
GRB 060729 that was measured with the Swift XRT [14]
is plotted together with its best ﬁt CB model light-curve
[10]. Its late time afterglow, as measured with Swift XRT
between 1.5× 105− 1.5× 107 s, shows a power-law decline
with αx = 1.46± 0.025 and a photon spectral index Γx =
1.99±0.07 [14], which yields an expected αx = Γx−1/2 =
1.49 ± 0.07, in good agreement with its observed value.
In the CB model, the break/bend time of the afterglow
in the GRB rest frame satisﬁes [18] tb ∝ 1/[Ep E1/3
iso ],
where Eiso and Ep are, respectively, the GRB equivalent
isotropic gamma-ray energy and the peak photon energy.
Hence, very intense GRBs with relatively large Ep and
Eiso values have a relatively small tb, which can be hidden
under the prompt X-ray emission or its fast decline phase
[10]. Consequently, only the post break temporal decline
of the afterglow with a decay index αx = βx + 1/2 =
Γx − 1/2 is observed [15]. This is demonstrated in Figure
2 where the light-curve of the 0.3-10 keV X-ray afterglow
of the very intense GRB 061007 (Eiso ≈ 1054 erg [19])
that was measured with the Swift XRT [14], is plotted
together with the best ﬁt single power-law decay, which
yields αx = 1.55 ± 0.04 compared to the CB model pre-
diction αx = βx + 1/2 = 1.03 ± 0.05 + 1/2 = 1.53 ± 0.05.

FIG. 2: The X-ray light-curve of the intense GRB 061007
that was measured with the Swift XRT [14] and its CB model
best ﬁt, which yields an early break and a start time hidden
under the prompt emission phase and a post break late-time
temporal decay index αx = 1.55. The temporal decay index
in the CB model that is expected from the measured spectral
index βx = 1.03 ± 0.05 is αx = βx + 1/2 = 1.53 ± 0.05.

FIG. 3: The ratio R = αx/(Γx − 1/2) obtained from the X-
ray afterglows of the 28 intense GRBs (Eiso > 5 × 1053 erg)
listed in Table 1, which was obtained from the long follow-
up measurements with Beppo-SAX, Swift XMM Newton and
Chandra space based observatories. The heavy line is their
average value, < R >= 1.002 + 0.004.

X-ray afterglows of all intense GRBs, we have extended
our test to the X-ray afterglows of all the 28 most intense
GRBs measured todate to have Eiso > 5 × 1053 erg) and
were followed up with an X-ray space based observatory
for at least a few days. These GRBs are listed in Table
1 together with their measured redshift z, Eiso, mean
photon spectral index Γx, and best ﬁt temporal index αx
assuming a single power-law decline (corresponding to a
constant ISM density along the CB trajectory). The val-
ues of the ratio R = αx/(Γx − 1/2) obtained for these
28 intense GRBs are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen
from Figure 3, only in two GRBs out of 28, the ratio
R deviates signiﬁcantly (by more than a standard devi-
ation) from the CB model prediction R = 1. However,
both measuring errors and bumpy circumburst/ISM den-
sity can cause deviations from a simple power-law light-
curve and R = 1 (e.g., GRB 080319B [14]). The mean
value of R, however, for a large enough sample of intense
GRBs is expected to converge to 1.
Indeed, the mean
value of R for the entire sample of the 28 intense GRBs
is < R >= 1.002 + 0.004.

The most accurate test, however, of the prediction
αx = Γx − 1/2 for a single GRB is provided by the
follow-up measurements of the X-ray afterglow of GRB
130427A, the most intense GRB ever detected by the
Swift Burst Alert Telescope, with the Swift XRT and the
sensitive X-ray observatories XMM Newton and Chandra
up to a record time of 83 Ms after burst [13]. The mea-
sured light-curve showed a single power-law decline with

αx = 1.309 ± 0.007 in the time interval 47 ks - 83 Ms.
The measured spectral index βx = 0.79 ± 0.03, yields
αx = βx + 1/2 = 1.29 ± 0.03, in remarkable agreement.
Moreover, a CB model best ﬁt to the combined measure-
ments of the X-ray light-curve of GRB 130427A with
Swift-XRT [14] XMM Newton and Chandra [13] that is
shown in Figure 4 yielded αx = βx + 1/2 = 1.294 ± 0.03.
No doubt, the assumptions of a constant ISM density
or a wind-like circumburst density (with no deviations)
during the afterglow phase, is an over simpliﬁcations (see,
e.g., GRB080319B [14]). Moreover, the distance of a CB
from its source in a constant density ISM, at a late time
is given roughly by,

L =

2c R t γδdt

1 + z ≈

4cγ2

0√tb t
1 + z

.

(5)

This distance may exceed the scale-height of the nearly
constant density ISM disk of the GRB host galaxy. The
transition of a CB into the Galactic halo in face-on disk
galaxies will break the late-time power-law decline into
a faster decline, ∼ t−βx+1), as may have been observed
in several GRBs, e.g., in GRB 060729 with Chandra at
t > ×107 s [21].
Conclusions: The 83 Ms record-long follow-up mea-
surements of the X-ray afterglow of GRB 130427A, the
brightest gamma-ray burst detected in the last 30 years,
with the sensitive Chandra and XMM Newton observa-
tories [13], provide an accurate test of a key prediction of
GRB theories - the relation between the spectral index

FIG. 4: The X-ray light-curve of the intense GRB 130427A
that was measured with Swift XRT [14] and with XMM New-
ton and Chandra [13] up to 83 Ms after burst, and its CB
model best ﬁt with a start time and early break hidden under
the prompt emission phase. The late-time post-break power-
law decline has an index αx = 1.29. The temporal decay index
predicted by the CB model for a measured spectral index [13]
βx = 0.79 ± 0.03 is αx = βx + 1/2 = 1.29 ± 0.03.

and the temporal decay of the late-time GRB afterglows.

While the measurements challenge [13] the relations pre-
dicted by the standard FB model for a constant inter-
stellar or a wind-like circumburst density [22], the single
power-law decline of the observed light-curve of the 0.3-
10 keV X-ray afterglow of GRB 130427A is exactly that
predicted by the CB model of GRBs for a constant in-
terstellar density from the precisely measured spectral
index.

Moreover, the late-time X-ray afterglows of the 28
most intense GRBs with known redshift that have been
followed long enough after burst with either Beppo-SAX,
Swift, Chandra or XMM Newton, show within errors a
single power-law decline with a decay index and spectral
index which satisfy within errors the CB model relation
αx = βx + 1/2 for a constant ISM.

Furthermore, the ’missing jet breaks’ in the X-ray af-
terglows of the very intense GRBs, such as 061007 and
130427A, most probably, are hidden under the prompt
emission or their fast declining tails, as expected from
the well satisﬁed CB model correlation [18] tb ∝ 1/[(1 +
z)Ep E1/3
iso ].

Unlike the FB models, the CB model has provided
many falsiﬁable predictions, which have been veriﬁed by
the mounting data on GRB afterglows, such as the canon-
ical behavior of X-ray afterglows, which was predicted
[16] long before its empirical discovery with Swift [17], the
universal dependence of the late-time temporal decline
of afterglows on the spectral index of the afterglows [23],
and many correlations among afterglow observables and
between them and prompt emission observables [18],[24].
