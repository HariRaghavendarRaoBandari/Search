An exploration of normalish subgroups of R. Thompson’s

groups F and T

Collin Bleak

March 8, 2016

Abstract

In this short note, we show that R. Thompson’s group F admits a normalish
amenable subgroup, and that the standard copy of F in R. Thompson’s group T
is normalish in T . We further conjecture that if F is non-amenable, then T does not
admit a normalish amenable subgroup, and therefore that the reduced C ∗ algebra of
T is in fact simple in that case.

Keywords: R. Thompson Groups, Normalish Subgroups, C∗-simplicity

Introduction

In [7], the authors show that if R. Thompson’s group T has a simple reduced C ∗ algebra
(T is C ∗-simple), then F is non-amenable. Later, in [1] it is shown that the Kesten
Test (commonly used to detect Powers’ Criterion for C ∗-simplicity) cannot be used in
the case of the group T . This and other anecdotal evidence has lead some to speculate
that T might fail to be C ∗-simple despite the fact that T is a group with trace. If true,
T would provide a new and interesting example of this rare phenomenon (see [6] for
Adrien Le Boudec’s examples of such groups).

The paper [3] provides a new test for C ∗-simplicity for a group. Namely, if a
group admits no normalish amenable subgroups, then it is C ∗-simple. A group M is
normalish in a group G if and only if given any ﬁnite set K := {k1, k2, . . . km} ⊂ G we
have

∩m
i=1M ki 6= {1G}.

Focussing now on the R. Thompson groups, consider S1 = R/Z (we use the pa-
rameterisation provided by the map t 7→ e2πit). The standard R. Thompson’s groups
F < T are groups of orientation-preserving piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of S1
which preserve the dyadic rationals and which admit at most ﬁnitely many breaks in
slope, appearing only over the dyadic rationals (cid:8) a
2k | a, k ∈ Z(cid:9), and with all slopes of
aﬃne components being integral powers of 2. In this case, T is the full group of such
homeomorphisms, whereas F is the subgroup of T which stabilises the point 0 under

1

the natural action of T on S1. See [5] for a survey of the important R. Thompson
groups.

Our ﬁrst result has bearing on R. Thompson’s group F .

Theorem 1. R. Thompson’s group F admits a normalish amenable subgroup.

Our second observation is that the canonical version of F in T is a normalish

subgroup in R. Thompson’s group T .

Remark 2. For the standard R. Thompson groups F < T , we have that F is normalish
in T .

In particular, in the case that F is amenable, then T admits a normalish amenable
subgroup. This of course agrees with the Haagerup-Olesen result that if T is C ∗-simple,
then F is non-amenable.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Emmanuel Breuillard and Kate Juschenko
for interesting discussions of the C ∗-simplicity of the groups F and T , where their
questions and discussions motivated the creation of this note.

1.1 Further explorations

It is of abiding interest whether the converse of the Haagerup-Olesen result is also true.
As mentioned before, some researchers have noted that the result in [1] provides a ﬁrst
indication that T may not be C ∗-simple even if F is non-amenable. We do not take
this view.

The set X of subgroups of T which admit no embedded copies of R. Thompson’s
group F , and no embedded non-abelian free subgroups, is a very interesting and com-
plex set. Two key results which may be of assistance in understanding constraints on
the elements of groups in the set X are Brin’s Ubiquity Theorem, and Lemma 1.9 of
[2]. To state Brin’s Ubiquity Theorem, we require Brin’s notion of orbital. We say a
group H ≤ PLo(I) has an orbital (a, b) if (a, b) is an open interval in I := [0, 1] and the
interval (a, b) is a component of support of the action of H on I. Likewise, if g ∈ H,
we say an interval (c, d) is an orbital of g if it is an orbital of hgi. If H has an orbital
(a, b) and c ∈ (a, b), and g ∈ H has an orbital of the form (a, c) or (c, b) then we say g
approaches a (or respectively b) in (a, b).

Theorem 3 (Brin’s Ubiquity). Let H be a subgroup of PLo(I). Assume that H has
an orbital (a, b) and that some element of H approaches one end a or b in (a, b) but
not the other. Then H contains a subgroup isomorphic to F .

A form of the contrapositive of Lemma 1.9 of [2] is the following lemma.

Lemma 4. Let 1 < k ∈ N and suppose F := {g1, g2, . . . , gk} is a set of orientation-
preserving homeomorphisms of S1 each of which admits a non-trivial ﬁxed set, and
suppose further that

then hg1, g2, . . . , gki contains non-abelian free subgroups.

∩1≤i≤k Fix(gi) = ∅,

Together, these results imply that for any H ∈ X the elements of H admit very
strong conditions on how their components of support can overlap. While we will not
investigate this further here, we note that our proof that F is normalish in T does
not appear to translate directly to apply to such a group H, and so we conjecture the
following.

Conjecture 5. Every normalish subgroup of T contains embedded copies of R. Thomp-
son’s group F or of non-abelian free subgroups.

2 Normalish subgroups exist

In this section we show our Theorem 1 and Remark 2. First though, we recall some
notation.

Let g ∈ F ∪ T , and recall the deﬁnition

Supp(g) := {x ∈ (0, 1) | x · b 6= x}.

We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.

Proof. Consider the standard generator x0 of F , and another function b ∈ F so that
Supp(b) = (1/4, 1/2). Since 1/4 · x0 = 1/2, we have that W = hx0, bi ∼= Z ≀r Z,
noting that this is a standard construction. We observe that the base group D of W
is generated by X := {bxk
0 | k ∈ Z} which is all of the conjugates of b by x0. Further
note that

D ∼= M

Z

Z

as the generators in the set X are pairwise disjoint.

We now observe that as any element of F is linear near some neighbourhood of 0,
with slope some value 2k, we have that |X c ∩ X| = ∞ for any conjugator c, since many
of these generators will be taken to each other in a small neighbourhood of 0 by the
conjugation action of the ﬁrst linear part of c.

Therefore D is a normalish amenable subgroup of F .

Similarly, we will now show that the standard version of R. Thompson’s group F

in T is normalish in T .

Proof. Let K = {k1, k2, . . . km} ⊂ T and consider the set

Y := {F ki | 1 ≤ i ≤ km}

which consists of subgroups of T which are conjugates of F .

From the deﬁnition of F given in the introduction, F contains all orientation-
preserving dyadic pl-homeomorphisms of [0, 1]; these are the homeomorphisms which
ﬁx 0 and 1 (identiﬁed in the circle S1), having (only ﬁnitely many) breaks in slope, all
of which are occurring at dyadic rationals, and where all slopes of aﬃne components
are integral powers of 2. In particular, for any dyadic interval ( a
2k ), consider the
set B( a
2k ), which set is commonly

known to generate a subgroup of F isomorphic to F (this follows easily from Cannon,
Floyd and Parry’s survey [5]). It is now immediately the case that the intersection

I := ∩1≤i≤mF ki

is an inﬁnite set. This is easy to see, since it contains any such set B( a
interval ( a

2k ) is disjoint from the set

2j , b

2j , b

2k ) where the

{0 · ki | 1 ≤ i ≤ m} ∪ {0}.

We comment that there are other arguments for our Remark 2 which might be
easier than the above, but, one should be careful: T admits subgroups with global
ﬁxed point set not empty, which are not conjugate in T to subgroups of the canonical
embedding of F in T .
