3D Sisyphus Cooling of Trapped Ions

(Dated: March 1, 2016)

Using a laser polarization gradient, we realize 3D Sisyphus cooling of 171Yb+ ions conﬁned in and
near the Lamb-Dicke regime in a linear Paul trap. The cooling rate and ﬁnal mean motional energy
of a single ion are characterized as a function of laser intensity and compared to semiclassical and
quantum simulations. Sisyphus cooling is also applied to a linear string of four ions to obtain a mean
energy of 1–3 quanta for all vibrational modes, an approximately order–of–magnitude reduction
below Doppler cooled energies. This is used to enable subsequent, eﬃcient sideband laser cooling.

PACS numbers: 37.10.De, 37.10.Ty

Applications of laser–cooled, trapped ions range from
quantum information processing [1–6] and spectroscopy
and metrology [7–10] to the study of interactions with
cold atoms [11–13] and the study of few-body “phase
transitions” [14–18]. Central to many of these appli-
cations is the manipulation of the collective vibrational
modes of a string of Coulomb-coupled ions. The modes
of interest are often required to be prepared in their
quantum mechanical ground state, which is commonly
achieved with sideband laser cooling [19–21] or electro-
magnetically induced transparency (EIT) cooling [22,
23].
In practice, these techniques are implemented for
reasons of eﬃciency in the Lamb-Dicke regime, where the
ions’ residual amplitude of vibration is small compared
to the wavelength of the cooling laser [2, 24, 25]. Doppler
laser pre-cooling is usually suﬃcient to attain this con-
dition, but if the trap is somewhat weaker, the ions will
not begin close to the ground state, or deep in the Lamb-
Dicke regime. In the case of Raman-transition sideband
cooling [20], this lengthens and complicates the sequence
to walk the vibrational modes down the ladder of energy
levels. Here we consider Sisyphus laser cooling [26, 27],
well known for neutral atoms, to act as a bridge between
Doppler and ground-state laser cooling for ions. This
relaxes the requirement on trapping strength, which is
of technological relevance for larger mass ions, and for
the weaker axial conﬁnement necessary to maintain lin-
ear strings of larger ion number. As a convenient means
to reach near-ground-state energies, Sisyphus cooling of
trapped ions is a technique of potential broad applicabil-
ity in analogy with experiments with neutral atoms.

Since Sisyphus cooling was ﬁrst demonstrated in a
3D optical molasses [28], the technique has been widely
adopted to cool neutral atomic gasses to sub-Doppler
temperatures [29]. Sisyphus cooling, primarily due to
polarization gradients, has also been used for the cooling
and localization of atoms in optical lattices [30–34], opti-
cal cavities [35, 36] and optical tweezers [37–39]. Several
theoretical investigations, both semiclassical and quan-
tum, have extended the concept of Sisyphus cooling to a
single ion conﬁned in the Lamb-Dicke regime, with pro-
posals considering cooling in both intensity [40, 41] and

polarization [42, 43] gradients. Semiclassical simulations
have also been used to study the ﬁnal cooling energy in
the crossover from the case of a bound ion in the Lamb-
Dicke limit to the free-particle case [44]. Despite these
theoretical works, the Sisyphus cooling of trapped ions
has been reported only once, for one and two ions [45].
In this case, however, the conﬁnement along the axis be-
ing cooled was so weak that the cooling was essentially
the same as for free atoms.

In this Letter we realize the 3D Sisyphus cooling of
ions conﬁned in and near the Lamb-Dicke regime. We
ﬁrst characterize the cooling, based on a polarization gra-
dient, as a function of laser intensity for a single ion.
We then extend the technique to a linear string of four
ions to demonstrate simultaneous cooling of all its vi-
brational modes. For our case of 171Yb+ ions with an
F = 1 → F = 0 cooling transition [Fig. 1(a)], we con-
struct a periodic polarization gradient in a transverse
magnetic ﬁeld as shown in Fig. 1(b) [46]. For high enough
magnetic ﬁeld (low enough intensity), the ground state
coherences associated with coherent population trap-
ping [47, 48] can be ignored. A polarization gradient
at the ion trap then gives rise to state-dependent light
shift potentials and spatially dependent optical pumping
such that a Sisyphus cooling eﬀect occurs for blue detun-
ing (∆ > 0). A single-ion cooling limit corresponding to
a mean motional quantum number of ¯n ≈ 1 is expected
when the depth of the light shift potentials is on the order
of the zero-point energy in the harmonic trap [42, 44].

Our detailed studies of Sisyphus cooling with a sin-
gle 171Yb+ ion are done in a linear Paul trap operating
at a radio frequency of ΩT /2π = 17.4 MHz [48]. Typical
secular trap frequencies are {ωx, ωy}/2π = {0.790, 0.766}
MHz in the transverse direction and ωz/2π = 0.525 MHz
in the axial direction. An applied 5.9–G magnetic ﬁeld
gives a Zeeman shift of δB/2π = 8.2 MHz between the
6s2S1/2|F = 1, mF i sub-levels. A laser beam detuned by
–10 MHz of the 6s2S1/2(F = 1) − 6p2P1/2(F = 0) tran-
sition at λ = 369.5 nm provides ﬂuorescence detection
and Doppler cooling with ¯n ∼ 20 in all trap directions.
Optical pumping for initialization of the ion into the
2S1/2|0, 0i state is achieved with a laser modulation side-

formed by counter-propagating, linearly polarized Sisyphus beams in a transverse magnetic ﬁeld. (c) Laser beam conﬁguration:
Double-pass acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) are used to control the power and frequency of the Sisyphus beams, which
enter the vacuum chamber and trap from the north and south sides. Perpendicular Raman beams entering from the east and
south are used to probe ion motion in the axial (ˆz) trap direction; west and south beams are used for the transverse (ˆx and ˆy)
directions. Shown at right are the axial and transverse Raman wavevector directions overlaid on the principal axes of the trap.

band driving the 2S1/2(F = 1) − 2P1/2(F = 1) transition.
A polarization–gradient ﬁeld overlapping the trap is
created by two counter-propagating and cross-polarized
laser beams with ∼40-µm waists. The beams are derived
from the Doppler cooling laser [Fig. 1(c)]. Acousto-optic
modulators are used to obtain a detuning of ∆/2π = 310
MHz above the 2S1/2(F = 1) − 2P1/2(F = 0) resonance
and allow for independent adjustment of the power (<45
µW) and frequency of the Sisyphus beams. The projec-
tions of either beam’s wavevector along the trap direc-
tions (υ = {x, y, z}) have magnitudes kυ = 2π
}
such that cooling is provided in 3D. The Lamb-Dicke
parameters ηυ = kυrυ in terms of the ground-state sizes
rυ = (/2mωυ)1/2 are {0.052, 0.053, 0.090}. The polar-
ization of each beam is calibrated in situ from ac Stark
shifts measured using microwave Ramsey interferometry
between the 2S1/2|0, 0i ≡ |↓i and 2S1/2|1, 0i ≡ |↑i states.
The single-beam intensities I, or equivalently on-resonant
saturation parameters s0 = I/(51 mW/cm2), are also
determined in this way, and are balanced to better than
10%. During Sisyphus cooling, the ion can be weakly op-
tically pumped via the 2P1/2|F = 1i state into the dark
|↓i state and so out of the cooling cycle. To repump the
ion, we use a pulsed sequence consisting of periods of
Sisyphus cooling interleaved with reset operations com-
posed of a 10-µs optical pumping pulse followed by a 90-
µs microwave π-pulse to prepare the ion in the |↑i state.
For optimal Sisyphus cooling of a single ion we should set
the maximum of the polarization gradient at the center
of the trap [40, 42], which requires interferometric stabil-
ity between the Sisyphus beams. Instead, we introduce
a 0.080–MHz frequency diﬀerence between the beams to
average over their relative phase – and its slow drifts –
with a concomitant decrease in cooling rate and increase
in cooling limit.

based on motion-sensitive, two-photon carrier transi-
tions, for example |↓i|nzi ↔ |↑i|nzi [2]. A set of three
oﬀ-resonant Raman beams (detuned by 100 GHz) allows
us to obtain a carrier transition that is sensitive to motion
in either the axial or transverse direction (see Fig. 1(c)).
The experiment sequence [Fig. 2(a)] involves 6.6 ms of
Doppler cooling, then Sisyphus cooling, and ﬁnally ther-
mometry operations. The thermometry involves the ac-
quisition of a carrier Rabi oscillation with initialization
via optical pumping to |↓i, and internal-state readout via
state-sensitive ﬂuorescence detection.

We ﬁrst measure the Sisyphus cooling rate as a func-
tion of laser intensity. The cooling rate at each intensity
value is extracted from a set of measurements of ¯n at
diﬀerent Sisyphus cooling times, where the value of ¯n at
each time is obtained from a ﬁt to the carrier Rabi os-
cillation [Figs. 2(b)–2(e)]. We vary the Sisyphus cooling
time by varying the number of Sisyphus pulses with their
duration kept constant. The pulse duration for a given
beam intensity is set to keep the probability of pumping
out of the cooling cycle to 15%. The ﬁt function for the
Rabi oscillation assumes an initial thermal distribution
of motional Fock states and includes ﬁxed corrections for
detection eﬃciencies. The only free ﬁt parameters are
¯n and a carrier Rabi frequency scale. In the transverse
direction, our Raman setup couples to both x and y mo-
tions with equal Raman wavevector projection onto each
axis [Fig. 1(c)]. We use an approximate 2D model for
the transverse ﬁts in which we assume the same ¯n for
both axes and ignore the eﬀect of Raman transitions re-
lated to cross-mode coupling between the axes [2]. Even
though we do not resolve the closest of these transitions
to the carrier, simulations show that the ﬁt model is ade-
quate for the ¯n range considered (≤5% systematic eﬀect
at highest ¯n values) [49].

Fig. 2(f) for both the axial and transverse directions. An
exponential ﬁt is used to extract a cooling time constant
τ . Since on average the ion is cooled 85% of the time, due
to the eﬀect of pumping dark, our plotted cooling rate is
1. Figures 3(a)–3(b) show
calculated as Γc = (τ /0.85)−
the intensity dependence of the axial and transverse cool-
ing rates. The cooling rates in the two directions com-
pare within a factor of 2 of each other over the measured
range, spanning more than a factor of 40. Power-law ﬁts
of the axial and transverse data give exponents 1.98(6)
and 1.91(3) respectively, which match well with the ex-
pected s2
0 scaling in the Lamb-Dicke regime and in the
absence of coherences between Zeeman levels [42, 49].

Next, we measure the steady-state mean occupation
number ¯nss as a function of laser intensity. Potential
heating sources such as micro-motion and laser power
noise are checked and minimized (if necessary) on a reg-
ular basis during data collection. At each intensity, the
single-pulse cooling time is set to keep the probability of
pumping out of the cooling cycle at a ﬁxed value of 20%,
and a cooling time in excess of 9τ is chosen to allow the
energy of the ion to reach equilibrium. Figures 3(c)–3(d)
show the intensity dependence of ¯nss for both the axial
and transverse directions. In each case, a cooling limit
of ¯nss ≃ 1.5–2 is obtained at an optimum intensity. The
lower optimum intensity in the less strongly conﬁned ax-
ial direction is consistent with the theoretical expectation
for an ion in the Lamb-Dicke regime [40, 42].

formed to assess the experimental results. For all simula-
tions the trap is treated in the pseudo-potential approx-
imation, and a 0.080–MHz frequency diﬀerence between
the Sisyphus beams is included. We consider both 1D and
3D semiclassical Monte Carlo simulations, which treat
the motion of the ion classically and include a period of
Doppler cooling followed by Sisyphus cooling to match
the experiment. The Sisyphus cooling model follows the
rate-equation approach of [44] with the appropriate diﬀu-
sion heating terms calculated according to [50, 51]. The
eﬀect of photon scattering from the 2P1/2|F = 1i states,
which is omitted in the simulations, is included in the ¯nss
values presented through an intensity–dependent correc-
tion determined analytically [49]. The quantum simula-
tion is implemented in 1D with the Monte-Carlo wave-
function method [52] according to [53]. It includes the
hyperﬁne structure of the 2S1/2–2P1/2 transition and co-
herences between Zeeman levels, but ignores any coher-
ences between F –levels. The 2S1/2|0, 0i state is eﬀec-
tively eliminated by assuming an instantaneous recoilless
repump. The majority of our quantum simulations use

an initial Fock state of ni = 8 and are limited to a Hilbert
space of 20 motional n–levels in order to restrict the com-
putational time required. A limited subset of points is
repeated with a thermal initial state at Doppler temper-
ature and a Hilbert space of 200 n–levels.

For the transverse cooling rate [Fig. 3(a)], all the simu-
lation models match the experimental results fairly well.
In the weaker axial direction [Fig. 3(b)], the 3D semi-
classical simulation matches the data better overall than
the 1D semiclassical simulation and distinctly better than
the quantum simulation with ni = 8. The discrepancy
between the 1D and 3D semiclassical simulations (by a
factor of 2–3) suggests that the axial cooling behavior is
aﬀected by the transverse motion, perhaps due to mo-
tional coupling or due to the additional delocalization of
the ion. Simulations in a tighter trap by a factor of three
(that is deeper in the Lamb-Dicke regime) do not show
this diﬀerence. The higher axial cooling rate predicted
by the 1D quantum simulation with ni = 8, by an over-
all factor of 3–4, is related to the lower initial motional
energy used in the calculation. As shown in Fig. 3(b),
a thermal initial state with a Doppler cooled value of
¯n = 22 brings the quantum result in line with the 1D
semiclassical simulation and closer to the experimental
data, indicating the eﬀect of deviations from the Lamb-
Dicke regime in the early cooling dynamics.

For the transverse ¯nss in Fig. 3(c), the quantum and
semiclassical simulations lie close to one another and only
show a small discrepancy with the data over the inten-
sity range considered. In the axial direction, there is a
much stronger discrepancy between the experiment and
theory by up to a factor of 2, although the general be-
haviors still agree. While the source of the discrepancies
remains to be identiﬁed, we have veriﬁed that the carrier
thermometry does not present a measurement limit.

In the ﬁnal experiment, we extend Sisyphus cooling to
a linear string of ions, speciﬁcally N = 4 ions conﬁned
in a slightly weaker axial trap with ωz/2π = 0.34 MHz.
All the ions in the 16-µm long string interact with the
polarizaton gradient ﬁeld. We choose s0 = 15 and apply
the cooling for a duration of 30 × 0.2 ms. The experimen-
tal sequence is the same as for a single ion; however, for
thermometry of each vibrational normal mode, we mea-
sure red-sideband Rabi oscillations starting from either
the | ↓↓↓↓i or the | ↑↑↑↑i state, and ﬁt the oscillations
together to ﬁnd ¯nss for an assumed thermal distribu-
tion [54]. The Raman beams nominally uniformly illumi-
nate the ions. Figure 4(a) shows an example of the Rabi
oscillations for the y-axis zigzag mode. The ﬁt function
ignores spectator–mode eﬀects [2], which are expected to
be small given that all modes are Sisyphus cooled. We
also modify the ﬁt function to account for experimental
imperfections in the Raman transition, including optical
pumping as a result of spontaneous emission and loss of
contrast due to residual intensity inhomogeneities across
the ion string. Figure 4(b) shows the mean vibrational

number ¯nss following Sisyphus cooling for all of the 3N
normal modes as a function of their frequency. The Sisy-
phus cooling reduces the energy of all modes to ¯nss ≤ 3.
Starting from the Sisyphus cooled string, we have im-
plemented separate sideband cooling of all modes with a
typical result of ¯n ≤ 0.05 (for example, Fig. 4(c)).

In conclusion, Sisyphus laser cooling has been used
to reduce the thermal energy of trapped ions in 3D by
approximately an order of magnitude, thereby bridging
Doppler and sideband cooling in our setup. In addition
to providing near ground-state cooling, Sisyphus cooling
beneﬁts from a simplicity and robustness because it is not
a resonant process, and so does not require ﬁne tuning
of multiple cooling parameters. The Sisyphus technique
is convenient to implement since it requires only modest
optical power and uses the same single direction of opti-
cal access as for Doppler cooling. In future, the Sisyphus
cooling time could be reduced in our setup by eliminating
the pulsed reset in favor of a continuously active repump
laser. Further investigation of the cooling performance
with respect to a range of parameters, and the cross-over
to behavior outside the Lamb-Dicke regime [44], will be
presented elsewhere [49]. The Sisyphus technique should
immediately extend to ion strings at least moderately
larger than four ions. This opens up the possibility in
our setup to explore dynamics of the linear-zigzag tran-
sition in and near the quantum regime [55], and should be
of interest for recent proposals to study heat transport in
ion strings [56–60]. Sisyphus cooling may also be useful
in quantum information applications where ground-state
cooling is not required, for example in microwave-based
quantum logic [61–63] or other proposed schemes [64].
