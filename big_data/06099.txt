Abstract

The Wiener index W (G) is the sum of distances of all pairs of vertices of
the graph G. The Wiener polarity index Wp(G) of a graph G is the number of
unordered pairs of vertices u and v of G such that the distance dG(u, v) between u
and v is 3. In this paper the Wiener and the Wiener polarity indices of sun graphs
are computed. A relationship between those indices with some other topological
indices are presented. Finally, we ﬁnd the Hosoya (Wiener) polynomial for sun
graphs.

Introduction

In theoretical chemistry, distance based molecular structure descriptors are used for
modeling physical, pharmacologic, biologic and others properties of chemical com-
pounds [13, 14].

Let G = (V, E) be a ﬁnite undirected connected graph. The distance between two
vertices u and v in G, denoted by dG(u, v), is the length of a shortest path between u
and v in G. A tree is a connected acyclic graph. Let dG(v) of a vertex v be the sum of
all distances between v and all other vertices of G.

The Wiener index W (G) of G is deﬁned by

W (G) = X

dG(u, v).

u,v⊆V (G)

One can deﬁne the Wiener index also in a slightly diﬀerent way

W (G) =

1
2

X

dG(v).

v∈V (G)

The Wiener polarity index WP (G) of a graph G of order n is deﬁned as the number
of unordered pairs of vertices u and v of G such that the distance dG(u, v) between u
and v is 3. WP (G) was recently introduced and receive more attention. The authors
in [12] demonstrated quantitative structure-property relationships in a series of acyclic
and cycle-containing hydrocarbons by using WP (G). Hosoya [9] found a physical-
chemical interpretation of WP (G). Recently, [5] gives all trees (resp. unicyclic graphs)
of order n minimizing and maximizing the Wiener polarity. Some extremal properties
on particular trees were given in [4, 2, 3, 11].

A k−sun graph (k ≥ 3), is the graph on 2k vertices obtained from a clique c1, ..., ck
on k vertices and an independent set s1, ..., sk on k vertices. The set of edges is deﬁned
by couples sici, sici+1, 1 ≤ i < k, and skck, skc1, see ﬁgure 1.

The paper is organized as follow, the Wiener and the Wiener polarity indices of sun
graphs are computed in section 2. In section 3, a relationship between those indices
with some other topological indices are presented. Finally, in section 4 we ﬁnd the
Hosoya (Wiener) polynomial for sun graphs.

2 Exact Wiener and Wiener Polarity Index of k-sun graphs

Let G = (V, E) be a k-sun graph for k ≥ 3, obtained from a clique c1, ..., ck on k vertices
and an independent set s1, ..., sk.

Theorem 1 Let G be a k−sun graph (k ≥ 3) then, W (G) = k(4k − 5).

Proof. We have by deﬁnition

W (G) =

1
2

=

X

dG(v),

v∈V (G)
1
2

X

v∈U (G)

dG(v) +

2

X

dG(v).

v∈C(G)

2

Where C(G) a clique c1, ..., ck on k vertices and U (G) an independent set s1, ..., sk of
G.

Let U = X

dG(v) and C = X

dG(v). Then, for a vertex ui chosen arbitrar-

v∈U (G)

v∈C(G)

ily, then

U = k.(d(ui, ci) + d(ui, ci+1) + d(ui, ui+1) + d(ui, ui−1)

+(k − 2)d(ui, cj) + (k − 3)d(ui, uj))

with d(ui, ci) = 1, d(ui, ci+1) = 1, d(ui, ui+1) = 2, d(ui, ui−1) = 2, d(ui, cj) = 2
and d(ui, uj) = 3. Hence, U = k.(5k − 7).

Moreover, for a vertex ci chosen arbitrarily, we have

C = k.((k − 1)d(ci, cj) + d(ci, ui) + d(ci, ui+1) + (k − 2)d(ci, uj))
with d(ci, cj) = 1, d(ci, ui) = 1, d(ci, ui+1) = 1, d(ci, uj) = 2.
Then, C = k.(3k − 3), proving a result.

Theorem 2 Let G be a k−sun graph then WP (G) =

k(k − 3)

2

.

If k = 3, then Wp(G) = 0 since diam(G) = 2.

Proof.
Let G = (V, E) be a k-sun graph for k ≥ 4.
Let compute WP (G) =| {{u, v} | dG(u, v) = 3, u, v ∈ V } |.

All distances of all pairs of vertices {u, v} such that dG(u, v) = 3 are resumed below

If u = ci and v = cj then dG(u, v) ≤ 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k, 1 ≤ j ≤ k,

If u = si and v = ci then dG(u, v) = 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k,

If u = si and v = ci+1 then dG(u, v) = 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k,

dG(u, v) = 2, for all u = si, v = cj, j 6= i + 1, i 6= k and j 6= 1, with 1 ≤ i ≤ k,

1 ≤ j ≤ k,

Finally, dG(u, v) = 3 if and only if u = si, v = sj, with i 6= j j 6= i + 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ k,

1 ≤ j ≤ k. |{{u, v}/dG(u, v) = 3}| = k − 3, proving the result.

3 Relation between Wiener and Wiener Polarity index

The ﬁrst Zagreb index M1(G), is deﬁned as the summation of squares of the degrees
of the vertices, and the second Zagreb index M2(G), is the sum of the products of the
degrees of pairs of adjacent vertices of the graph G. These topological indices were
introduced by Gutman and Trinajsti´c [6].

In [10] and for d ≥ 1, authors deﬁne a generalization of Wiener polarity index as
the number of unordered pairs of vertices {u, v} of G such that the shortest distance
between u and v is d.

Wd(G) =| {{u, v} | dG(u, v) = d, u, v ∈ V }.

So we have

W (G) =

diam(G)

P
d=1

Wd(G).

Lemma 3 [1] Let G be a graph then

Wp(G) ≤

n(n − 1)

2

−

2

M1(G),

with equality if diam(G) = 3.

Corollary 4 [1] If diam(G) ≤ 3 then W (G) =

3n(n − 1)

2

−

1
2

M1(G) − m.

This corollary is valid for sun graphs since their diameter is ≤ 3 with n = 2k.

Corollary 5 Let G be a sun graph then W (G) =

3n(n − 1)

2

−

1
2

M1(G) − m.

Proposition 6 Let G be a sun graph then W (G) = n(n − 1) + Wp(G) − m.

Proof. From corollary 1, 2 and lemma 1, we have

M1(G) = n(n − 1) + Wp(G) − m,

W (G) =

3n(n − 1)

2

−

1
2

n(n − 1) + Wp(G) − m − m,

hence W (G) = n(n − 1) + Wp(G) − m.

4 The Hosoya (Wiener) polynomial of sun graphs

The Hosoya (Wiener) polynomial of graphs is deﬁned by:

H(G, t) =

D
X
k=1

d(G, k)tk.

The wiener index of a graph G can be determined as the ﬁrst derivative of the

polynomial H(G, t) at t = 1, such that W (G) =

D
X
k=1

k.tk

Theorem 7 Let G be a sun graph, then we have
.t3.

k(k + 3).t + k(k − 1).t2 +

H(G, t) =

k(k − 3)

1
2

2

Proof.

We have H(G, t) =

3
X
k=1

d(G, k)tk, since G is a sun graph.

We have d(G, 1) = |{(u, v) d(u, v) = 1}|, the pairs are {ui, ci}k

i=1; {ci, ui+1}k

i=1, and

{ci, cj }k

i,j=1. Then d(G, 1) = k + k +

k(k − 1)

.

2

d(G, 2) = |{(u, v) d(u, v) = 2}|, the pairs are {ui, ui+1}k

i=1; {ui, cj}k

i=1,i6=1,k. Then

d(G, 2) = k + k(k − 2) = k(k − 1).

d(G, 3) = |{(u, v) d(u, v) = 3}|, the pairs are {ui, uj}k

i=1,j6=i+1,i,i−1. Then d(G, 3) =

k(k − 3)

2

, proving the result.

Remark 8 The wiener index of a sun graph G can be calculated in another way such
as the ﬁrst derivative of the polynomial H(G, t) at t = 1, then

W (G) =

1
2

k(k + 3) + 2k(k − 1) + 3

k(k − 3)

2

= k(4k − 5)

Corollary 9 Let G = S3 be the 3-sun graph, then H(S3, t) = 9.t + 6.t2.
