STRONG EXPONENT BOUNDS FOR THE

LOCAL RANKIN-SELBERG CONVOLUTION

March 2016

Abstract. Let F be a non-Archimedean locally compact ﬁeld. Let σ and τ
be ﬁnite-dimensional semisimple representations of the Weil-Deligne group of F .
We give strong upper and lower bounds for the Artin and Swan exponents of
σ ⊗ τ in terms of those of σ and τ . We give a diﬀerent lower bound in terms of
σ ⊗ ˇσ and τ ⊗ ˇτ . Using the Langlands correspondence, we obtain the bounds for
Rankin-Selberg exponents.

1. Let F be a non-Archimedean, locally compact ﬁeld. For integers m, n > 1
let π, ρ be irreducible, smooth, complex representations of the general linear
groups GLm(F ), GLn(F ) respectively. If s is a complex variable and ψ a non-
trivial smooth character of F , we consider the L-function L(π × ρ, s) and the
local constant ε(π × ρ, s, ψ) of [17] or [21], [22]. If q is the cardinality of the
residue ﬁeld of F , the local constant takes the form

ε(π × ρ, s, ψ) = ε(π × ρ, 0, ψ) q−s(Ar(π×ρ)+mnc(ψ)).

Here, c(ψ) is an integer depending only on ψ. The integer Ar(π × ρ) depends
only on the pair (π, ρ). Here we call it the Rankin-Selberg exponent of (π, ρ).

If we take n = 1 and let ρ be the trivial character 1 of F × ∼= GL1(F ),
then ε(π × 1, s, ψ) is the Godement-Jacquet local constant ε(π, s, ψ) [10], and
Ar(π × 1) is denoted simply Ar(π). The aim of this paper is to give strong,
universal estimates for Ar(π × ρ) in terms of Ar(π) and Ar(ρ). We give a second
lower bound in terms of exponents of the pairs (π, ˇπ), (ρ, ˇρ). These results are

F , of dimension d, let ε(σ, s, ψ) be the Langlands-Deligne local
constant [3],[23] of σ. Again, ε(σ, s, ψ) = ε(σ, 0, ψ) q−s(Ar(σ)+dc(ψ)) and the
integer Ar(σ) is the Artin exponent of σ. A deﬁning property of the Langlands
correspondence [14], [16] is that

respectively.

ε(π × ρ, s, ψ) = ε(Lπ ⊗ Lρ, s, ψ).

Consequently, Ar(π × ρ) = Ar(Lπ ⊗ Lρ) and Ar(π) = Ar(Lπ). We may therefore
tackle the Rankin-Selberg exponent via the Artin exponent of tensor products
of representations of the Weil-Deligne group.

3. We state our results for representations of the Weil-Deligne group. If σ ∈

F , σ 6= 0, write

bWD

η(σ) = Ar(σ)/ dim σ,

F , σ 6= 0.

σ ∈ bWD

Convention. When σ is the zero representation, η(σ) is undeﬁned. So, use of
the symbol η(σ) here will always entail the implicit assumption σ 6= 0.

Say that σ is η-minimal if Ar(σ) 6 Ar(χ ⊗ σ), for any character χ of WF .

F is η-minimal, then
η(σ ⊗ τ ) > 1

2 max {η(σ), η(τ )},

Theorem A. If σ ∈ bWD

F .

A trivial example shows that some hypothesis of minimality is required for
a result of this kind:
F and a character χ of WF , one has
η((χ ⊗ σ) ⊗ (χ−1 ⊗ τ )) = η(σ ⊗ τ ). For suitable choice of χ, one has η(χ ⊗ σ) =
η(χ−1 ⊗ τ ) = η(χ) and this may be taken as large as desired.

for ﬁxed σ, τ ∈ bWD

Further examples show that the constant 1

2 is best possible: there are many
pairs of irreducible representations (σ, τ ), with σ being η-minimal, for which
2η(σ ⊗ τ ) = η(σ) = η(τ ). However, by restricting the class of representation one
can get better constants: see the examples in 2.3 and 3.5.

There is a second, rather diﬀerent, lower bound. This avoids the necessity
for a minimality condition by using the operation σ 7→ ˇσ of contragredience on

F , then

If σ and τ are indecomposable, then η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) > max {η(σ ⊗ ˇσ), η(τ ⊗ ˇτ )}.

The easy example σ = τ shows that the constant 1

2 is again best possible.

With regard to upper bounds, we prove:

Theorem C. Let σ, τ ∈ bWD

F have dimensions m, n respectively. The Artin

Ar(σ ⊗ τ ) 6 nAr(σ) + mAr(τ ) − min {Ar(σ), Ar(τ )}.

F are irreducible, then

If σ, τ ∈ bWD

η(σ ⊗ τ ) 6 max {η(σ), η(τ )}.

Both aspects of the result are best possible.

4. Let π, ρ be irreducible, smooth, complex representations of GLm(F ), GLn(F )
respectively. Set η(π × ρ) = Ar(π × ρ)/mn and η(π) = Ar(π)/m, with the
same convention regarding zero representations. Say that π is η-minimal
if
η(π) 6 η(χπ) for all characters χ of F ×. The Langlands correspondence re-
spects contragredience and twisting with characters, so we have the following
consequences of Theorems A–C.

Corollary A. Let π, ρ be irreducible representations of the groups GLm(F ),
GLn(F ) respectively. If π is η-minimal, then

η(π × ρ) > 1

2 max {η(π), η(ρ)}.

Corollary B. If π, ρ are irreducible representations of the groups GLm(F ),
GLn(F ) respectively, then

η(π × ˇρ) > 1

2(cid:0)η(π × ˇπ) + η(ρ × ˇρ)(cid:1).

If π and ρ are essentially square-integrable, then

η(π × ˇρ) > max {η(π × ˇπ), η(ρ × ˇρ)}.

Corollary C. Let π, ρ be irreducible representations of the groups GLm(F ),
GLn(F ) respectively. The Rankin-Selberg exponent satisﬁes

Ar(π × ρ) 6 nAr(π) + mAr(ρ) − min {Ar(π), Ar(ρ)}.

If the representations π and ρ are cuspidal, then

η(π × ρ) 6 max η(π), η(ρ)}.

In all of these statements, the representations π, ρ are assumed smooth. Corol-

lary C may also be found in [1], where it receives a diﬀerent proof.

that the concepts of η-minimality and ς-minimality are distinct.) We then have
the following results.

6. We review some background material in section 1. The proof of Theorem A
starts in section 2, where we deal with irreducible representations. At present,
these can only be treated via parallel properties for irreducible cuspidal represen-
tations of general linear groups and then using the Langlands correspondence.
The method relies on the explicit formula for Ar(π × ρ) in [6], combining the
classiﬁcation theory of [7], [8], [9] with the interpretation [22] of the Rankin-
Selberg exponent as a relative Plancherel measure. This is where the factor 1
2 of
Theorem A ﬁrst appears and reveals itself as best possible. The main part of the
proofs of Theorems A and AS is in section 3. The arguments are all conducted
on the Galois side. They are essentially elementary although, in places, they
feel intricate.

Theorem B and BS are treated in section 4. The proofs start from relatively
simple properties of tensor products of irreducible representations observed in
[12], [5] but are equally intricate. For the pairs A/AS, B/BS of parallel theorems,
the proofs start together. We then concentrate on the more involved case of the
Artin exponent. That done, the argument for the Swan exponent follows a
shorter version of the same route, obtained by a simple change of vocabulary.
We indicate the process brieﬂy at the ends of the relevant sections. The results
are not so easy to deduce from each other, and nothing seems to be gained from
constructing an artiﬁcal framework in which they can be treated together. The
proofs of Theorems C and CS are short, and combined in section 5.

the unique character of WF that is trivial on the inertia subgroup of WF and
takes the value q−1 on geometric Frobenius elements.

For our purposes, a representation σ of the Weil-Deligne group of F is a pair
(σW, n) consisting of a ﬁnite-dimensional, smooth, semisimple representation
σW : WF → AutC(V ) and a nilpotent endomorphism n of the vector space V
such that

To deﬁne the tensor product (σ, m) ⊗ (τ, n), let σ act on a vector space V and

τ on W . One sets

(σ, m) ⊗ (τ, n) = (σ ⊗ τ, m ⊗ 1W + 1V ⊗ n).

F denote the direct sum of the characters x 7→ kxki, for

nilpotent endomorphism n such that Spn(1) = (spn, n) is a representation of
the Weil-Deligne group. The isomorphism class of Spn(1) is independent of the
choice of n.

More generally, let σ ∈ bWirr

F . We deﬁne

Spn(σ) = σ ⊗ Spn(1).

An exercise [23] (4.1.5) yields:

Let ψ be a non-trivial smooth character of F and s a complex variable. The

ε(σ, s, ψ) = ε(σ, 0, ψ) q−(Ar(σ)+nc(ψ))s.

The constant ε(σ, 0, ψ) is non-zero. The exponent Ar(σ) is a non-negative integer
depending only on σ and c(ψ) is an integer depending only on ψ. The function
σ 7→ Ar(σ) is additive with respect to direct sums. In simple cases, it is given
as follows.

Fact 1.

(1) If χ is an unramiﬁed character of WF , then Ar(Spr(χ)) = r−1.

F . If σ is a direct sum of unramiﬁed characters of WF ,

then Ar(σ, n) equals the rank of the linear operator n.

F is not an unramiﬁed character, then Ar(Spr(σ)) = rAr(σ).

We make repeated use of the following observation.

Fact 2. If σ ∈ bWirr
Lemma. If σ, τ ∈ bWirr

F , then
ς(σ ⊗ τ ) 6 max {ς(σ), ς(τ )},

and

η(σ ⊗ τ ) 6 max {η(σ), η(τ )}.

Equality holds in the ﬁrst instance if ς(τ ) 6= ς(σ), in the second if η(τ ) 6= η(σ).

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion follows from Fact 2. A simple calculation from the
deﬁnition then gives the second. (cid:3)

Note. We have proved the parts of Theorems C and CS relating to irreducible
representations. We do not return to those results until section 5.

Proposition. Let m, n be positive integers. If χ, ξ are unramiﬁed characters
of WF then

Ar(Spm(χ) ⊗ Spn(ξ)) = mn − min {m, n},

η(Spm(χ) ⊗ Spn(ξ)) = max {η(Spm(χ)), η(Spn(ξ))}.

Proof. The two assertions are visibly equivalent so we prove the ﬁrst. There are
positive integers ri and unramiﬁed characters χi of WF , 1 6 i 6 l, so that

Spm(χ) ⊗ Spn(ξ) =

Spri(χi).

i=1 ri = mn. Using the deﬁnition of η and the additivity of the

exponent Ar, we get

Write Spm(χ) = (σ, m), where m is a regular nilpotent endomorphism of Cm.
Likewise write Spn(ξ) = (τ, n), so that Spm(χ) ⊗ Spn(ξ) = (σ ⊗ τ, l), where
l = m ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ n. In this form, the integer mn−l is the rank of the nilpotent
operator l (1.3 Fact 1(2)). It is therefore enough to recall:

BOUNDS FOR RANKIN-SELBERG EXPONENTS

Lemma. Let m (resp. n) be a regular nilpotent endomorphism of the vector
space V = Cm (resp. W = Cn). The operator l = m ⊗ 1W + 1V ⊗ n has rank
mn − min{m, n}.

The proof of the lemma is a straightforward exercise which completes the

proof of the proposition. (cid:3)

2. Irreducible representations

We prove Theorems A and AS for irreducible representations of WF , taking an
indirect approach. We state and prove analogous results for irreducible cuspidal
representations of general linear groups GLn(F ) and then use the Langlands
correspondence.

2.1. We need some deﬁnitions. Let π be an irreducible cuspidal representation
of GLn(F ), for an integer n > 1. If χ is a character of F ×, then χπ denotes the
representation g 7→ χ(det g)π(g), g ∈ GLn(F ).

We recalled in the introduction the deﬁnition of the Artin exponent Ar(π) of

π. We also use the notation η(π) = Ar(π)/n.

The Swan exponent Sw(π) of π is deﬁned by Sw(π) = Ar(π)−n except in
the case where n = 1 and χ is an unramiﬁed character of F × = GL1(F ). In
that case, Sw(π) = 0.
In all cases, Sw(π) > 0. We also use the notation
ς(π) = Sw(π)/n.

If σ = Lπ ∈ bWirr

F is the irreducible representation of WF attached to π by
the Langlands correspondence, then Ar(σ) = Ar(π) and η(σ) = η(π). The
deﬁnitions ensure that Sw(π) = Sw(σ) and ς(π) = ς(σ).

We make a similar modiﬁcation to the Rankin-Selberg exponent Ar(π × ρ)

deﬁned in the introduction.

Deﬁnition. Let ρ (resp. π) be an irreducible cuspidal representation of GLm(F )
(resp. GLn(F )). Let d be the number of unramiﬁed characters χ of F × such that
χρ ∼= ˇπ. Set

Sw(π × ρ) = Ar(π × ρ) − mn + d,

ς(π × ρ) = Sw(π × ρ)/mn.

Note that if, in this deﬁnition, we have d 6= 0, then m = n and d divides
n. As a consequence of the deﬁnition and corresponding properties of the Artin
exponent, we have:

10

C.J. BUSHNELL AND G. HENNIART

Fact. Let π be an irreducible cuspidal representation of GLn(F ).

(2) If ρ is an irreducible cuspidal representation of GLm(F ) and Lρ = τ ,

F , then Sw(π) = Sw(σ) and ς(π) = ς(σ).

(1) If σ = Lπ ∈ bWirr

then Sw(π × ρ) = Sw(σ ⊗ τ ) and ς(π × ρ) = ς(σ ⊗ τ ).

2.2. We remark on some upper bounds.

Proposition. For i = 1, 2, let πi be an irreducible cuspidal representation of
GLni (F ).

(1) We have ς(π1 × π2) 6 max {ς(π1), ς(π2)}. If ς(π1) 6= ς(π2), then ς(π1 ×

π2) = max {ς(π1), ς(π2)}.

(2) We have η(π1 × π2) 6 max {η(π1), η(π2)}, with equality in the case

η(π1) 6= η(π2).

Proof. This follows from 1.3 Lemma via the Langlands correspondence. (cid:3)

2.3. We consider the more substantial problem of lower bounds.

Proposition. For i = 1, 2, let πi be an irreducible cuspidal representation of
GLni (F ). If π1 is ς-minimal then ς(π1 × π2) > 1

2 max {ς(π1), ς(π2)}.

Proof. By 2.2 Proposition, we have ς(π1 × π2) = max {ς(π1), ς(π2)} provided
ς(π1) 6= ς(π2). Assume therefore that ς(π1) = ς(π2). In that case, ς(π1 × π2) >
ς(π1 × ˇπ1), by 2.2 Theorem of [2]. We therefore need to prove the following
crucial result.

Lemma. Let π be an irreducible cuspidal representation of GLn(F ), for some
n > 1. If π is ς-minimal, then ς(π × ˇπ) > ς(π)/2.

Proof. If ς(π) = 0, then also ς(π × ˇπ) = 0, as an instance of [6] 6.5 Theorem. We
therefore assume ς(π) > 0. Thus π contains a simple character θ, attached to a
simple stratum [a, m, 0, β] in the matrix algebra Mn(F ). The algebra F [β] is a
ﬁeld, of degree dβ, say, over F and ramiﬁcation index eβ. Indeed, θ is “m-simple”
(cf. [4], especially Corollary 1), so eβ equals the F -period of the hereditary order
a and ς(π) = m/eβ. The element β determines a certain non-negative integer
c(β), as in [6] 6.4, such that ς(π × ˇπ) = c(β)/d2
β.

We next choose a simple stratum [a, m, m−1, α] equivalent to [a, m, m−1, β].
It

Let the ﬁeld extension F [α]/F have degree dα and ramiﬁcation index eα.

BOUNDS FOR RANKIN-SELBERG EXPONENTS

11

minimal over F (in the sense of [7] 1.4.14) and, since π is ς-minimal, dα > 1.
To calculate c(α), we take a simple stratum [a′, m′, 0, α] in the matrix algebra
EndF (F [α]) ∼= Mdα (F ). The integer m′ is meα/eβ and, by 4.1 Proposition of
[5], c(α) = m′dα(dα−1))/eα. Therefore

ς(π × ˇπ) > c(α)/d2

2 ς(π),

α = (1 − d−1

α ) m/eβ > m/2eβ = 1

as required. (cid:3)

This completes the proof of the proposition. (cid:3)

Example 1. Let π be an irreducible, cuspidal representation of GL2(F ). Sup-
pose that π is ς-minimal and ς(π) > 0. In the proof of the last lemma, we get
α = β and dα = 2. This implies ς(π × ˇπ) = 1
2 in the
proposition is therefore best possible as applied to arbitrary representations.

2 ς(π). The constant 1

Example 2. One can improve the constant by restricting the class of represen-
tations under consideration. For example, if ℓ > 3 is a prime number and if ρ is
an irreducible, ς-minimal, cuspidal representation of GLℓ(F ) with ς(ρ) > 0, the
same argument gives ς(ρ × ˇρ) = (1−ℓ−1)ς(ρ) > 1

2 ς(ρ).

We translate in terms of Artin exponents. Let π be an irreducible cuspidal
representation of GLn(F ). If π is η-minimal, it is then ς-minimal. (The converse
does not hold: the case n = 1 and Ar(π) = 1 provides an example).

Corollary. For i = 1, 2, let πi be an irreducible cuspidal representation of
GLni (F ). If π1 is η-minimal then η(π1 × π2) > 1

2 max {η(π1), η(π2)}.

Proof. If either πi is an unramiﬁed character of F ×, there is nothing to prove
so we assume otherwise. Suppose next that π2 is not an unramiﬁed twist of ˇπ1.
Thus

η(π1 × π2) = ς(π1 × π2)+1 > 1
= 1

2 max {ς(π1), ς(π2)}+1
2 max {η(π1), η(π2)} + 1
2 .

Finally suppose π2 is an unramiﬁed twist of ˇπ1. Thus ς(π1×π2) = ς(π1×ˇπ1). The
lemma then gives ς(π1 × π2) > 1
2 ς(π2). In this case, n1 = n2 and, since
π1 is not an unramiﬁed character of F ×, we have n1 > 1. If d(π1) is the number
of unramiﬁed characters χ for which χπ1 ∼= π1, we have d(π1)/n2

αjη(τj) = η(τ ),

as required. (cid:3)

3.2. Let σ ∈ bWD

F . Say that σ is η-homogeneous if there exists a ∈ R such that
η(τ ) = a, for every irreducible factor τ of σ on WF . When this holds, we write
ℓ0(σ) = a.

Example. If τ is irreducible and σ = Spr(τ ), then σ is η-homogeneous with
ℓ0(σ) = η(τ ). Moreover, ℓ0(σ) = η(σ) if ℓ0(σ) 6= 0. If ℓ0(σ) = 0, then τ is an
unramiﬁed character and η(σ) = 1−r−1.

Proposition. Let σ ∈ bWD

where the τj are irreducible and rj > 1.

F be η-homogeneous and write σ = Lj∈J Sprj (τj),

(1) The representation σ is η-minimal if and only if each τj is η-minimal.
(2) If σ is η-minimal, then

η(χ ⊗ σ) = max {η(σ), η(χ)},

for all characters χ of WF .

Proof. Set a = ℓ0(σ). If a = 0, then σ is η-minimal, each Sprj (τj) is η-minimal
and (2) is immediate. We assume henceforth that a > 0.

Take ﬁrst the case where σ is indecomposable, say σ = Spr(τ ). If dim τ = 1,
it is clear that σ is η-minimal if and only if η(τ ) = 0, contrary to hypothesis.
Therefore dim τ > 1 and a = η(σ) = η(τ ). Let χ be a character of WF , and set
η(χ) = c. If c > a, then

η(χ ⊗ σ) = η(χ ⊗ τ ) = c > a = η(σ),

(1.3 Lemma). If, however, c < a, we get η(χ ⊗ σ) = a = η(σ) > c. Suppose
ﬁnally that c = a. Since dim τ > 1, we get η(χ ⊗ σ) = η(χ ⊗ τ ).
If τ is
not η-minimal, we may choose χ so that η(χ ⊗ τ ) < η(τ ) and so σ is not η-
minimal. If τ is η-minimal, η(χ ⊗ τ ) = η(τ ) and we are done with the case of σ
indecomposable.

For the general case, we set σ =Lj∈J σj, where σj is indecomposable. Put

αj = dim σj/ dim σ, so that

Xj

αj = 1 and η(χ ⊗ σ) =Xj

αjη(χ ⊗ σj).

Suppose σj is not η-minimal, for some j ∈ J. We have just shown that there
exists χ with η(χ) = a and η(χ ⊗ σj) < η(σj). On the other hand, η(χ ⊗ σk) 6
η(σk) for k 6= j (cf. 1.3 Lemma), so

η(χ ⊗ σ) =Xi∈J

αiη(χ ⊗ σi) <Xi∈J

αiη(σj) = η(σ),

14

C.J. BUSHNELL AND G. HENNIART

whence σ is not η-minimal.

Assume, therefore, that every σj is η-minimal. Let c = η(χ). If c > a, the
discussion of the indecomposable case gives η(χ ⊗ σj) = c, j ∈ J, so η(χ ⊗ σ) =
c > η(σ). If, however, c < a, we get η(χ ⊗ σ) = a = η(σ). Thus σ is η-minimal
and we have also proven (2). (cid:3)

3.3. We use 3.2 Proposition to prove a special case of 3.1 Theorem.

Proposition. Let σ ∈ bWD

irreducible, then

F be η-minimal and η-homogeneous. If τ ∈ bWD

F is

η(σ ⊗ τ ) > 1

2 max {η(σ), η(τ )}.

Proof. Combining 3.2 Proposition with the decomposition technique used in 3.1,
we reduce to the case where σ is indecomposable and η-minimal. Let a = ℓ0(σ).

Consider ﬁrst the case where a = 0, that is, σ = Spr(χ) with χ an unramiﬁed
character of WF and r > 1. Thus η(σ) = (r−1)/r. On the other hand, σ ⊗ τ =
Spr(χ ⊗ τ ) and so

η(σ ⊗ τ ) =( η(τ )

η(σ)

if η(τ ) 6= 0,

if η(τ ) = 0.

In the ﬁrst case, we have η(τ ) > 1 > η(σ) while, in the second, η(τ ) 6 η(σ).
The result therefore holds when a = 0.

From now on, we assume a > 0. We write σ as Spr(ρ), where ρ is irreducible
and η-minimal. We have η(ρ) = η(σ) = a and dim ρ > 1. Assume initially that
there is no unramiﬁed character χ of WF such that χ ⊗ ρ ∼= ˇτ . This means that
no irreducible component of ρ ⊗ τ is unramiﬁed, so Ar(σ ⊗ τ ) = rAr(ρ ⊗ τ ) and

2η(σ ⊗ τ ) = 2η(ρ ⊗ τ ) > max {η(ρ), η(τ )},

by 2.3 Corollary. Since η(σ) = η(ρ), we are done in this case.

For the remaining case, we may assume ˇτ ∼= ρ: in particular, η(τ ) = a. Let d
be the number of unramiﬁed characters χ for which χ ⊗ ρ ∼= ρ. Thus d divides
m = dim ρ > 1. To estimate Ar(σ ⊗ τ ) = Ar(Spr(1) ⊗ ρ ⊗ ˇρ), we write

ρ ⊗ ˇρ = ρ′ ⊕ χ1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ χd,

where the χi are unramiﬁed characters of WF and every irreducible component
of ρ′ has strictly positive exponent. Thus

η(ρ ⊗ ˇρ) = (1 − d/m2)η(ρ′).

BOUNDS FOR RANKIN-SELBERG EXPONENTS

15

Also, η(ρ ⊗ ˇρ) > 1

2 η(ρ) by 2.3 Corollary. Taking this into account, we have

η(σ ⊗ τ ) = η(cid:0)(Spr(1) ⊗ ρ′) ⊕

dXi=1

Spr(χi)(cid:1)

= (1−d/m2) η(Spr(1) ⊗ ρ′) + d(r−1)/rm2
= (1−d/m2) η(ρ′) + d(r−1)/rm2
> (1−d/m2) η(ρ′)
> 1

2 η(ρ) = 1

2 η(τ ).

Since, in this case, η(ρ) = η(σ) the proof is complete. (cid:3)

We may now deal with 3.1 Theorem in the case where σ is η-homogeneous.

Corollary. Let σ ∈ bWD

indecomposable, then η(σ ⊗ τ ) > 1

2 max {η(σ), η(τ )}.

F is

If τ ∈ bWD

Proof. As in the proof of the proposition, it is enough to treat the case where
σ is indecomposable and η-minimal. Thus σ = Spr(σ′) and τ = Sps(τ ′), for
integers r, s > 1 and irreducible representations σ′, τ ′. We have

σ ⊗ τ =(cid:0)Spr(1) ⊗ Sps(1) ⊗ σ′(cid:1) ⊗ τ ′.

The representation σ′′ = Spr(1) ⊗ Sps(1) ⊗ σ′ is η-minimal and η-homogeneous
with ℓ0(σ′′) = ℓ0(σ) = η(σ′), so the proposition gives

η(σ ⊗ τ ) = η(σ′′ ⊗ τ ′) > 1

2 max {η(σ′′), η(τ ′)}.

It is therefore enough to show that

(∗)

max {η(σ′′), η(τ ′)} > max {η(σ), η(τ )}.

To do this, we write the tensor product Spr(1) ⊗ Sps(1) as a sum of indecom-
posable representations: there are unramiﬁed characters χi and positive integers
ri, 1 6 i 6 l, such that

We havePl

i=1 ri = rs and, by 1.4 Proposition, l = min {r, s}. Accordingly,

Spr(1) ⊗ Sps(1) =

lMi=1

Spri (χi).

σ′′ =

lMi=1

Spri(χi ⊗ σ′).

16

C.J. BUSHNELL AND G. HENNIART

is not unramiﬁed, then η(σ′′) = η(σ′) = η(σ). Likewise,

If σ′
if τ is not
unramiﬁed then η(τ ′) = η(τ ). So, if neither σ′ nor τ ′ is unramiﬁed, we get
max {η(σ′′), η(τ ′)} = max {η(σ), η(τ )}, proving (∗) in this case.

Suppose next that σ′ is unramiﬁed. By 1.4 Proposition, we have

η(σ′′) =Xi

(ri−1)/rs = 1 − l

rs ,

while η(σ) = (r−1)/r 6 η(σ′′). If τ ′ is not unramiﬁed, then η(τ ′) = η(τ ) and
we are done. If τ ′ is unramiﬁed, then η(τ ′) = 0 and η(τ ) = (s−1)/s 6 η(σ′′),
since l 6 s. This proves (∗) in all cases, and the proof is complete. (cid:3)

3.4. We enter the ﬁnal stage of the proof of 3.1 Theorem. We proceed in two
steps.

F is η-minimal then η(σ ⊗ τ ) > 1

2 η(σ), for all inde-

Proposition 1. If σ ∈ bWD
composable τ ∈ bWD

F .

Proof. It is enough to prove that η(ξi ⊗ τ ) > 1
2 η(ξi), for each indecomposable
component ξi of σ. There is a character χ such that χ ⊗ τ is η-minimal. Since
τ is indecomposable, χ ⊗ τ is η-homogeneous so 3.3 Corollary gives

η(ξi ⊗ τ ) = η(cid:0)(χ−1 ⊗ ξi) ⊗ (χ ⊗ τ )(cid:1) > 1

2 η(χ−1 ⊗ ξi).

Consequently,

η(σ ⊗ τ ) = η(χ−1 ⊗ σ ⊗ χ ⊗ τ ) > 1

2 η(χ−1 ⊗ σ).

As σ is η-minimal, so η(χ−1 ⊗ σ) > η(σ) and the result follows. (cid:3)

It now remains only to prove:

Proposition 2. If σ ∈ bWD

η(σ ⊗ τ ) > 1

2 η(τ ).

F is η-minimal and τ ∈ bWD

F is indecomposable, then

Proof. The representation τ is η-homogeneous. If τ is η-minimal the result fol-
lows from 3.3 Corollary and 3.1 Proposition. We therefore assume the contrary.

To proceed further, we need to extend 3.2 Proposition. Write

σ =Mi∈I

Spri(ξi),

for irreducible representations ξi and integers ri > 1. Let c = max η(ξi). Deﬁne
σmax as the sum of all factors Spri (ξi) for which η(ξi) = c, and σ′ as the sum of
the others.

BOUNDS FOR RANKIN-SELBERG EXPONENTS

Lemma. The representation σ′ is either zero or η-minimal.

Proof. Assume σ′
6= 0. Let dmax = dim σmax and d′ = dim σ′. Set d =
dmax+d′ = dim σ. Let φ be a character of WF and write s = η(φ). We compare
the expressions

dη(σ) = dmaxη(σmax) + d′η(σ′),

dη(φ ⊗ σ) = dmaxη(φ ⊗ σmax) + d′η(φ ⊗ σ′).

If s < c, then η(φ ⊗ σmax) = η(σmax) = c. Since η(φ ⊗ σ) > η(σ), we have
η(φ ⊗ σ′) > η(σ′). On the other hand, if s > c, then η(φ ⊗ σ′) = s > c > η(σ′).
This shows that η(φ ⊗ σ′) > η(σ′) for all φ. (cid:3)

If the representation σ′ is zero, then σ = σmax is η-homogeneous and η-
minimal. The proposition in this case is given by 3.3 Corollary. We assume
therefore that σ′ 6= 0. Certainly σmax 6= 0 so, using induction on the Jordan-
H¨older length of σ, we may assume

η(σ′ ⊗ τ ) > 1

2 η(τ ).

Let s = η(τ ) and let χ be a character such that χ ⊗ τ is η-minimal. Since we
assume τ is not η-minimal, we have η(χ) = s > 0 (1.3 Lemma).

Examining cases, suppose ﬁrst that s > c. Here, η(σ ⊗τ ) = s > s/2, implying
the result in this situation. If, on the other hand, s < c, we have η(σmax ⊗ τ ) = c
while, by inductive hypothesis, η(σ′ ⊗ τ ) > s/2. Writing α = dmax/d, β = d′/d,
we have

η(σ ⊗ τ ) = αη(σmax ⊗ τ ) + βη(σ′ ⊗ τ )

> αc + βs/2 > s/2.

It remains to treat the case s = c. Here, η(σ′ ⊗ τ ) = s = c, so

η(σ ⊗ τ ) = αη(σmax ⊗ τ ) + βs.

However, η(σmax ⊗ τ ) = η(cid:0)(χ−1 ⊗ σmax) ⊗ (χ ⊗ τ )(cid:1) while, by the very ﬁrst case

of this proof, we have

η(cid:0)(χ−1 ⊗ σmax) ⊗ (χ ⊗ τ )(cid:1) > 1

2 η(χ−1 ⊗ σmax).

That is,

This completes the proofs of 3.1 Theorem and Theorem A. (cid:3)

F is unramiﬁed if
its restriction to WF is a sum of unramiﬁed characters. Any such σ is both
η-minimal and η-homogeneous.

3.5. We digress to highlight a special case. Say that σ ∈ bWD

To justify this, one applies the argument of 3.1 twice to reduce to the case
where both σ and τ are indecomposable. The proof of 3.3 Proposition gives
the result when τ is irreducible.
In the proof of 3.3 Corollary, we still get
η(σ ⊗ τ ) = η(σ′′ ⊗ τ ′), so η(σ ⊗ τ ) > max {η(σ′′), η(τ ′)}. In the same proof, we
have shown that max {η(σ′′), η(τ ′)} > max {η(σ), η(τ )}, whence the assertion.

Starting again from the ﬁrst case of the proof of 3.3 Proposition, one may

If σ and τ are irreducible, this follows from 2.3 Proposition. An argument
identical to 3.1 Proposition shows it is enough to prove the theorem under the
additional hypothesis that τ is irreducible.

Say that σ ∈ bWss

F is ς-homogeneous if, for some a, we have ς(σ′) = a for
all irreducible components σ′ of σ. With this deﬁnition, the analogue of 3.2
Proposition holds with the same proof. In light of the case already done, where
σ and τ are irreducible, the analogue of 3.3 Proposition is immediate here and
the Corollary is redundant. The propositions of 3.4 hold, with identical proofs,
and the theorem is proved. (cid:3)

4. Symmetric lower bound

We prove Theorem B and deal with Theorem BS at the end of the section.
We ﬁrst accumulate some preliminary results concerning irreducible or indecom-
posable representations.

4.1. We start with what amounts to a special case of the theorem.

Proposition. If σ, τ are irreducible representations of WF , then

ς(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) > max {ς(σ ⊗ ˇσ), ς(τ ⊗ ˇτ )},

and

η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) > max {η(σ ⊗ ˇσ), η(τ ⊗ ˇτ )}.

Proof. For the ﬁrst assertion, we follow [12] but use the notation and layout
F carries a canonical pairing ∆ with non-negative
F .
As in [5] 3.1, there is a continuous, strictly increasing function Σσ such that
Σσ(∆(σ, τ )) = ς(σ ⊗ ˇτ ). Therefore ς(σ ⊗ ˇσ) 6 ς(σ ⊗ ˇτ ), as desired.

real values [5] (2.5.3). It has the property ∆(σ, σ) 6 ∆(σ, τ ), for all τ ∈ bWirr

In the second assertion, suppose ﬁrst that σ 6∼= χ ⊗ τ , for any unramiﬁed
character χ of WF . It follows that η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) = ς(σ ⊗ ˇτ )+1. The ﬁrst assertion

20

C.J. BUSHNELL AND G. HENNIART

then gives η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) > max {ς(σ ⊗ ˇσ)+1, ς(τ ⊗ ˇτ )+1}. However,

η(σ ⊗ ˇσ) = ς(σ ⊗ ˇσ) + 1 − dσ/m2,

where dσ is the number of unramiﬁed characters χ such that χ ⊗ σ ∼= σ and
m = dim σ. Likewise for τ , and the result follows.

If, on the other hand, there is an unramiﬁed character φ such that τ ∼= φ ⊗ σ,

we get η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) = η(σ ⊗ ˇσ) = η(τ ⊗ ˇτ ), and there is nothing to do. (cid:3)

4.2. The exponent has a striking ultrametric property.

Proposition. If σ, τ, ρ ∈ bWirr

F , then

ς(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) 6 max {ς(σ ⊗ ˇρ), ς(ρ ⊗ ˇτ )},

η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) 6 max {η(σ ⊗ ˇρ), η(ρ ⊗ ˇτ )}

Proof. The ﬁrst inequality is 3.1 Corollary of [5]. To deduce the second, let dστ
be the number of unramiﬁed characters χ for which τ ∼= χ ⊗ σ, and similarly for
the other pairs. Let m = dim σ, n = dim τ and l = dim ρ. Thus

η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) = ς(σ ⊗ ˇτ )+1 − dστ /mn,

and similarly for the others. The ﬁrst part of the proposition yields

η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) 6 max {η(σ ⊗ ˇρ) + dσρ/ml, η(ρ ⊗ ˇτ ) + dρτ /nl} − dστ /mn.

This gives the result if dστ = dσρ = dρτ = 0.
If dστ 6= 0, then m = n and
dσρ = dρτ . Also, η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) = η(σ ⊗ ˇσ) and η(ρ ⊗ ˇτ ) = η(ρ ⊗ ˇσ). The desired
inequality thus reduces to η(σ⊗ˇσ) 6 η(σ⊗ˇρ), which follows from 4.1 Proposition.
Similarly, if dσρ 6= 0, we have to check that η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) 6 max {η(σ ⊗ ˇσ), η(σ ⊗ ˇτ )},
and this is immediate. (cid:3)

4.3. We generalize the propositions of 4.1, 4.2 to indecomposable representa-
tions. To do this, we need some explicit formulas.

Let σ, τ be irreducible representations of WF of dimension m, n respectively.
Let dσ be the number of unramiﬁed characters χ such that σ ∼= χ ⊗ σ. Deﬁne
dτ similarly, and let dστ be the number of unramiﬁed characters χ such that
σ ∼= χ ⊗ τ . Let r > s > 1 integers, and set Σ = Spr(σ), T = Sps(τ ).

Lemma. With the notation above, we have

η(Σ ⊗ ˇT) = η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) + dστ (1−r−1)/mn,
η(Σ ⊗ ˇΣ) = η(σ ⊗ ˇσ) + dσ(1−r−1)/m2,
η(T ⊗ ˇT) = η(τ ⊗ ˇτ ) + dτ (1−s−1)/n2.

Proof. The second and third relations are instances of the ﬁrst, so we need only
prove that one.

We write σ ⊗ ˇτ = ρ ⊕ χ1 ⊕ χ2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ χd, where every component of ρ is not

unramiﬁed and χj is an unramiﬁed character, 1 6 j 6 d = dστ . Thus

η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) = (mn−d)η(ρ)/mn.

We also have

Σ ⊗ ˇT = Spr(1) ⊗ Sps(1) ⊗ σ ⊗ ˇτ .

Set R = Spr(1) ⊗ Sps(1) ⊗ ρ, so that η(R) = η(ρ). Expanding, we get

η(Σ ⊗ ˇT) = (mn−d)η(ρ)/mn + dη(Spr(1) ⊗ Sps(1) ⊗ Σjχj)/mn.

We use 1.4 Proposition (and the hypothesis r > s) to get

Spr(1) ⊗ Sps(1) =

sMk=1

Sprk (ξk),

for positive integers rk, with sum rs, and unramiﬁed characters ξk. In particular,

η(Spr(1) ⊗ Sps(1) ⊗ φ) = 1−r−1,

for any unramiﬁed character φ. Therefore

η(Spr(1) ⊗ Sps(1) ⊗ Σjχj) = d−1Xj

and, altogether,

η(Spr(1) ⊗ Sps(1) ⊗ χj) = 1−r−1

η(Σ ⊗ ˇT) = (mn−d)η(ρ)/mn + d(1−r−1)/mn

= η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) + d(1−r−1)/mn,

as required. (cid:3)

Proposition 1. If Σ, T ∈ bWD

F are indecomposable, then

η(Σ ⊗ ˇT) > max {η(Σ ⊗ ˇΣ), η(T ⊗ ˇT)}.

Proof. We write Σ = Spr(σ) and T = Sps(τ ), for σ, τ ∈ bWirr

F . Using the notation
of the lemma, suppose ﬁrst that dστ = 0. Using 4.1 Proposition and the formulas
from the lemma, we get

η(Σ ⊗ ˇT) = η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ) = ς(σ ⊗ ˇτ )+1

> ς(σ ⊗ ˇσ)+1 = η(σ ⊗ ˇσ) + dσ/m2 > η(Σ ⊗ ˇΣ),

and likewise η(Σ ⊗ ˇT) > η(T ⊗ ˇT).

Suppose therefore that dστ 6= 0. There is then an unramiﬁed character χ for
which τ ∼= χ ⊗ σ. In particular, m = n and dστ = dσ = dτ = d, say. From the
formulas above, we get η(Σ ⊗ ˇT) = η(Σ ⊗ Σ) > η(T ⊗ ˇT), which is enough. (cid:3)

Proposition 2. If Σ, T, R ∈ bWD

F are indecomposable then

η(Σ ⊗ ˇT) 6 max{η(Σ ⊗ ˇR), η(R ⊗ ˇT)}.

Proof. There are representations σ, τ, ρ ∈ bWirr

F and integers r, s, t such that
Σ = Spr(σ), T = Sps(τ ) and R = Spt(ρ). Let dim σ = m, dim τ = n and
dim ρ = l. Deﬁne integers dστ , dσ etc., as before.

Take ﬁrst the case where σ is not an unramiﬁed twist of τ . That is, dστ = 0

and η(Σ ⊗ ˇT) = η(σ ⊗ ˇτ ). If, for example, dσρ 6= 0 then l = m and

η(Σ ⊗ ˇR) = η(σ ⊗ ˇρ) + dσρ(1−q−1)/m2 > η(σ ⊗ ˇρ),

where q = max{r, t}.
If, on the other hand, dσρ = 0, we get the conclusion
η(Σ ⊗ ˇR) = η(σ ⊗ ˇρ). Similarly for the pair (ρ, τ ), so the desired inequality now
follows from 4.2 Proposition.

We therefore assume dστ 6= 0. Our assumption r > s implies η(Σ ⊗ ˇT) =

η(Σ ⊗ ˇΣ), while η(Σ ⊗ ˇΣ) 6 η(Σ ⊗ ˇR), by Proposition 1 above. (cid:3)

4.4. We now prove the main statement of Theorem B, that is:

η(σ1 ⊗ σ2) > 1

F , then

2(cid:0)η(σ1 ⊗ ˇσ1) + η(σ2 ⊗ ˇσ2)(cid:1).

Proof. We proceed by induction on r1r2, where ri is the number of isomorphism
classes of indecomposable direct factors of σi. The case r1r2 = 1 follows from
4.3 Proposition 1, so we assume r1r2 > 2.

If k is a positive integer, we may replace σ1 by kσ1 = σ1 ⊕ σ1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ σ1 (k
copies) without changing r1 or the formula to be proved. Likewise for σ2. We
may therefore assume that dim σ1 = dim σ2. Next, we choose an indecomposable
direct factor τi of σi, i = 1, 2, so as to minimize η(τ1 ⊗ ˇτ2).

Lemma 1. Using the preceding notation, there are positive integers k, a, b such
that

kσ1 = ρ1 ⊕ aτ1,

kσ2 = ρ2 ⊕ bτ2,

where

(a) dim ρ1 = dim ρ2 and either
(b) ρ1 has no direct factor equivalent to τ1 or
(c) ρ2 has no direct factor equivalent to τ2.

Proof. Let mi be the multiplicity of τi in σi and write di = dim τi. By symmetry,
we may assume d1m1 > d2m2. Thus

d1σ2 = ρ2 ⊕ d1m2τ2,

for a subspace ρ2 with no factor τ2. Likewise,

d1σ1 = ρ′

1 ⊕ d1m1τ1,

for a subspace ρ′

1 with no factor τ1. We have

dim ρ2 − dim ρ′

1 = d2

1m1 − d1d2m2.

This integer is divisible by d1 and is non-negative. So, d1σ1 admits a decompo-
sition d1σ1 = ρ1 ⊕ aτ1 in which dim ρ1 = dim ρ2 and a is a positive integer. The
result follows with k = d1 and b = d1m2. (cid:3)

We may replace (σ1, σ2) by (kσ1, kσ2) without changing anything. To simplify
notation, we assume that Lemma 1 holds with k = 1. The hypothesis r1r2 > 1

implies that one of the spaces ρi is non-zero, so both are. Extending notation
in the obvious way, we have r(ρ1)r(ρ2) < r1r2 so, by inductive hypothesis,

Put

2 η(ρ1 ⊗ ˇρ2) > η(ρ1 ⊗ ˇρ1) + η(ρ2 ⊗ ˇρ2).

α =

dim ρ1
dim σ1

=

dim ρ2
dim σ2

,

β = 1−α.

Applying the deﬁnition of η to the relations σ1 = ρ1 ⊕ aτ1, σ2 = ρ2 ⊕ bτ2, we get

η(σ1 ⊗ ˇσ2) = α2η(ρ1 ⊗ ˇρ2) + αβ(cid:0)η(ρ1 ⊗ ˇτ2)+η(τ1 ⊗ ˇρ2)(cid:1) + β2η(τ1 ⊗ ˇτ2),

η(σ1 ⊗ ˇσ1) = α2η(ρ1 ⊗ ˇρ1) + 2αβη(ρ1 ⊗ ˇτ1) + β2η(τ1 ⊗ ˇτ1),
η(σ2 ⊗ ˇσ2) = α2η(ρ2 ⊗ ˇρ2) + 2αβη(ρ2 ⊗ ˇτ2) + β2η(τ2 ⊗ ˇτ2).

4.3 Proposition 1 implies that

2 η(τ1 ⊗ ˇτ2) > η(τ1 ⊗ ˇτ1) + η(τ2 ⊗ ˇτ2).

The theorem will therefore follow from:

Lemma 2. With the preceding notation,

ς(ρ1 ⊗ ˇτ2) + ς(τ1 ⊗ ˇρ2) > ς(ρ1 ⊗ ˇτ1) + ς(τ2 ⊗ ˇρ2).

Proof. Write ρ1 =Li∈I ξi and ρ2 =Lj∈J θj, where ξi and θj are indecompos-

able. Thus

η(ρ1 ⊗ ˇτ1) =Xi∈I

αiη(ξi ⊗ ˇτ1), αi = dim ξi/ dim ρ1,

terms in the inequality to be proved. Combining these, and writing βj =
dim θj/ dim ρ2, the desired relation reduces to

and Pi∈I αi = 1. We have a similar formula for each of the the three other
Xi∈I
We multiply each sum over i by 1 =Pj βj and each in j by 1 =Pi αi. Com-

paring the αiβj-term on either side, we see it is enough to prove that

αiη(ξi ⊗ ˇτ1) +Xj∈J

αiη(ξi ⊗ ˇτ2) +Xj∈J

βjη(τ1 ⊗ ˇθj) >Xi∈I

βjη(τ2 ⊗ ˇθj).

η(ξi ⊗ ˇτ2) + η(τ1 ⊗ ˇθj) > η(ξi ⊗ ˇτ1) + η(τ2 ⊗ ˇθj),

i ∈ I, j ∈ J.

BOUNDS FOR RANKIN-SELBERG EXPONENTS

25

The choice of (τ1, τ2) gives

η(ξi ⊗ ˇτ2) > η(τ1 ⊗ ˇτ2),
η(τ1 ⊗ ˇθj) > η(τ1 ⊗ ˇτ2),

i ∈ I,

j ∈ J.

We now apply 4.3 Proposition 2 to get

η(ξi ⊗ ˇτ1) 6 max(cid:8)η(ξi ⊗ ˇτ2), η(τ2 ⊗ ˇτ1)(cid:9) = η(ξi ⊗ ˇτ2),
η(τ2 ⊗ ˇθj) 6 max(cid:8)η(τ2 ⊗ ˇτ1), η(τ1 ⊗ ˇθj)(cid:9) = η(τ1 ⊗ ˇθj),

whence the lemma follows. (cid:3)

This completes the proof of 4.4 Theorem and the main assertion of Theorem

B. The second assertion of Theorem B is 4.1 Proposition. (cid:3)

4.5. To prove Theorem BS, we can pass directly from the end of 4.1 to the start
of 4.4. From there on, the argument is identical: one simply replaces η by ς and
“indecomposable” by “irreducible” throughout.

5. Upper bounds

We prove Theorems C and CS.

5.1. We use a combinatorial device. Let A = Z(cid:2)R(cid:3) be the integral group ring of

the additive group of real numbers. We write the elements of A as ﬁnite formal
sums of symbols [α], α ∈ R. The ring A comes equipped with two canonical
homomorphisms

d : A −→ Z,

[α] 7−→ 1,

and

v : A −→ R,

[α] 7−→ α.

There is a unique bi-additive map A × A → A, denoted (x, y) 7→ x∨ y, so that

[α]∨ [β] =(cid:2)max {α, β}(cid:3), α, β ∈ R.

Let A+ be the set of elements Pα cα[α] such that cα = 0 if α < 0 and cα > 0

otherwise.

Proposition. If σ, τ ∈ A+, then

v(σ∨ τ ) 6 d(τ )v(σ) + d(σ)v(τ ) − min {v(σ), v(τ )}.

26

C.J. BUSHNELL AND G. HENNIART

Proof. If either σ or τ is the zero element of A, the assertion is trivial. We
therefore assume that both σ, τ ∈ A+ are non-zero and proceed by induction on
the integer d = d(σ+τ ) > 2. In the ﬁrst case d = 2, we have σ = [α], τ = [β],
for some positive real numbers α, β. The assertion is

max {α, β} 6 α + β − min {α, β}.

This holds with equality. For the general inductive step, we may assume by
symmetry that σ = σ1+σ2, for non-zero elements σi of A+. By inductive hy-
pothesis,

v(σi∨ τ ) 6 d(τ )v(σi) + d(σi)v(τ ) − min {v(σi), v(τ )},

i = 1, 2.

Adding and using the inductive hypothesis, we get

v(σ∨ τ ) 6 v(σ1∨ τ ) + v(σ2∨ τ )

6 d(τ )v(σ) + d(σ)v(τ ) − min {v(σ1), τ )} − min {v(σ2), τ )}

6 d(τ )v(σ) + d(σ)v(τ ) − min {v(σ), v(τ )},

as required. (cid:3)

Remark. If we ﬁx positive integers d1, d2, and real numbers v1, v2, there exist
σ1, σ2 ∈ A+ such that di = d(σi), vi = v(σi), and

v(σ1∨ σ2) = d2v1 + d1v2 − min {v1, v2}.

In other words, the inequality of the proposition is optimal.

5.2. We prove Theorem CS. Recall that the assertion of the theorem concerning
irreducible representations has been proved in 1.3 Lemma.

F gives an element S(σ) = dim(σ)[ς(σ)] of the ring

F , we deﬁne S(σ) ∈ A+ by

A representation σ ∈ bWirr
A of 5.1. For σ ∈ bWss

S(σ1 ⊕ σ2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ σr) =

This deﬁnition gives

S(σi),

rXi=1

F .

σi ∈ bWirr

v(cid:0)S(σ)(cid:1) = Sw(σ),
d(cid:0)S(σ)(cid:1) = dim σ,

F .

σ ∈ bWss

BOUNDS FOR RANKIN-SELBERG EXPONENTS

27

We know that ς(σ ⊗ τ ) 6 max{ς(σ), ς(τ )} when both representations σ, τ are
irreducible. In our present notation, this says

Sw(σ ⊗ τ ) 6 v(cid:0)S(σ)∨ S(τ )(cid:1),

F .

σ, τ ∈ bWirr

F , then

Consequently, if ρ, θ ∈ bWss
Sw(ρ ⊗ θ) 6 v(cid:0)S(ρ)∨ S(θ)(cid:1)

6 d(cid:0)S(τ )(cid:1)v(cid:0)S(σ)(cid:1) + d(cid:0)S(σ)(cid:1)v(cid:0)S(τ )(cid:1) − min(cid:8)v(cid:0)S(σ)(cid:1), v(cid:0)S(τ )(cid:1)(cid:9)

= dim(τ )Sw(σ) + dim(σ)Sw(τ ) − min {Sw(σ), Sw(τ )},

as required to prove Theorem CS. (cid:3)

5.3. We can use exactly the same argument to prove Theorem C once we es-
tablish:

Proposition. If R, T ∈ bWD

F are indecomposable, then

η(R ⊗ T) 6 max {η(R), η(T)}.

Proof. Let Σ ∈ bWD

F be indecomposable. Thus

η(R ⊗ T) 6 max {η(R ⊗ Σ), η( ˇΣ ⊗ T)},

by 4.3 Proposition 2. Taking for Σ the trivial character of WF , we get the
proposition. (cid:3)

This completes the proof of Theorem C. (cid:3)
