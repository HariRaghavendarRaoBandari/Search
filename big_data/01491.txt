EMBEDDINGS AND C ∗-ENVELOPES OF EXACT OPERATOR

SYSTEMS

PREETI LUTHRA AND AJAY KUMAR

Abstract. We prove a necessary and suﬃcient condition for embeddability of
an operator system into O2. Using Kirchberg’s theorems on tensor product of
O2 and O∞, we establish results on their operator system counterparts S2 and
S∞. Applications of the results proved, including some examples describing
C ∗-envelopes of operator systems, are also discussed.

1. Introduction

The study of operator systems with universal generators generating some well
studied C ∗-envelopes has attracted good interest in recent years (see [5, 6, 16, 21]).
Da Zheng ([21]) introduced the operator system Sn generated by Cuntz isometries
and later, in [17], Paulsen and Zheng explored the tensor product and nuclearity
related properties of this operator system.
Cuntz introduced the C ∗-algebras On(1 ≤ n ≤ ∞)(see [4]), in the year 1977, which
were the ﬁrst explicit examples of simple inﬁnite separable C ∗-algebras. Cuntz
proved that his algebras are simple and purely inﬁnite, and are independent of the
choice of generators.
In fact, these algebras played an important role in the classiﬁcation theory of purely
inﬁnite, simple, separable and nuclear C ∗-algebras, by Kirchberg and Philips. The
classiﬁcation theory for separable C ∗-algebras with certain properties in terms of
Cuntz algebras O2 and O∞ was given by Kirchberg and Rordam. One can refer to
[19] for a detailed discussion on this classiﬁcation programme.
There are basically three fundamental theorems given by Kirchberg; namely, the
embedding of separable exact C ∗-algebras into Cuntz algebra O2, and the tensor
product theorems for O2 and O∞. Many more generalizations of these results
were later proved by Kirchberg and Rordam.
In a recent work, Lupini [15] has
established an operator system analog of Kirchberg’s nuclear embedding theorem
involving the Gurarij operator system GS.
Since, for all 1 ≤ n ≤ ∞, On is a simple C ∗-algebra, it turns out that On is in fact
the C ∗-envelope of Sn([21]). This motivates us to study the Kirchberg’s theorems
on On (2 ≤ n ≤ ∞) in terms of the C ∗-envelopes of operator system.
After collecting prerequisites in Section 2, we prove an embedding theorem for
operator systems motivated by Kirchberg’s exact embedding theorem in Section 3.
It gives a necessary and suﬃcient condition for embedding an operator system
into O2 in terms of exactness of its C ∗-envelopes. Further, we could extend these

embeddibility conditions to ﬁnite minimal tensor product of operator systems. We
also discuss some nuclearity properties of operator systems embedding in O2.
In Section 4, results regarding embedding of operator systems of the form S ⊗min=c
S2 into O2 are proved. Further, we obtain some equivalent conditions for their
C ∗-envelopes to be ∗-isomorphic either to O2 or to a C ∗-subalgebra of O2. We
also prove results on operator system of the form S ⊗min=c S∞ using Kirchberg’s
theorems on tensor product of O∞.
Finally in Section 5, as an application of results proved, we check the embeddability
of some operator systems whose C ∗-envelopes are already calculated, into O2. A
description of C ∗-envelopes of some operator systems with tensor product factor
S2 or S∞ is also given, which adds few more operator systems to the short list of
known C ∗-envelopes.

2.1. Cuntz algebra and Kirchberg’s theorems. The Cuntz algebra [4] On,
where 2 ≤ n < ∞, is the universal unital C ∗-algebra generated by isometries
s1, s2, · · · , sn satisfying s1s∗
n = 1. The Cuntz algebra O∞
is the universal unital C ∗-algebra generated by an inﬁnite sequence of isometries
s1, s2, s3, · · · with mutually orthogonal range projections sjs∗
j which add upto iden-
tity.
j=1 of isometries in a unital C ∗-algebra A is said to satisfy the
A ﬁnite set {tj}n
Cuntz relation if t1t∗
j=1 of isometries
satisﬁes the Cuntz relation if their range projections {tjt∗
j=1 are mutually orthog-
onal. Cuntz algebra are well deﬁned in the sense that they are independent of the
choice of generating isometries.
A self-contained survey of classical theorems stated below can be found in [19].

The class of C ∗-algebras On have the following properties, as proved in [4]:

Theorem 2.1. For each n ∈ N and for n = ∞, the Cuntz algebra On is unital,
separable, simple, nuclear and purely inﬁnite.

Elliot proved an important self-absorbing property of O2 in 1993 :

Theorem 2.2. The C ∗-algebras O2 ⊗C ∗

- min O2 and O2 are isomorphic.

In the year 2000, Kirchberg ([12, Theorem 2.8]) characterized separable exact

C ∗-algebras through the following result:

Theorem 2.3. A unital separable C ∗-algebra A is exact if and only if it admits a
unital embedding into O2.

A complete characterization C ∗-algebras A for which A ⊗C ∗- min O2 ∼= O2 was

also given by Kirchberg([12, Theorem 3.7]).

Theorem 2.4. The tensor product A ⊗C ∗
if A is unital, simple, separable and nuclear.

- min O2 is isomorphic to O2 if and only

Kirchberg [12, Theorem 7.2.6] also gave a classiﬁcation of all separable, nuclear

C ∗-algebras that absorb O∞:
Theorem 2.5. For a simple, nuclear, separable C ∗-algebra A, A ∼= A ⊗C ∗
if and only if A is purely inﬁnite.

We’ll also use the following permanence properties several times ahead ([19,

Theorem 6.1.10][20, Corollary 4.21]):

Theorem 2.6.

(i) Every C ∗-subalgebra of an exact C ∗-algebra is again exact.

(ii) Every quotient of an exact C ∗-algebra is again exact.
- min B.
(iii) If A and B are exact then so is A ⊗C ∗
(iv) If A and B are simple C ∗-algebras then A ⊗C ∗

- min B is also simple.

2.2. Operator systems. The concept of operator systems and their tensor prod-
ucts is the familiar one now and most of the details can be seen in [9, 10, 11].
Recall that a concrete operator system is a unital self-adjoint subspace of B(H) for
some Hilbert space H. A C ∗-cover ([8, §2]) of an operator system S is a pair (A, i)
consisting of a unital C ∗-algebra A and a complete order embedding i : S → A such
that i(A) generates the C ∗-algebra A. The C ∗-envelope as deﬁned by Hamana [8],
of an operator system S is a C ∗-cover deﬁned as the C ∗-algebra generated by S
in its injective envelope I(S) and is denoted by C ∗
e (S)
enjoys the following universal “minimality” property ([8, Corollary 4.2]):

e (S). The C ∗-envelope C ∗

e (S), for any C ∗-cover (A, i) of S, there is a
e (S) such that π(i(s)) = s for

Remark 2.7. If an operator system S has a simple C ∗-cover (A, i) then using this
minimality property π is injective and A is ∗-isomorphic to the C ∗-envelope of S.

From [21], for the generators s1, s2, · · · , sn (n ≥ 2) of the Cuntz algebra On and
identity I, the Cuntz operator system Sn denotes the operator system generated
by s1, s2, · · · , sn, that is,

Sn = span{I, s1, s2, · · · , sn, s∗
Similarly, for the generators s1, s2, · · · of O∞,

The following well known fact follows directly from 2.7 and Theorem 2.1

Given two operator system tensor products α and β, an operator system S is
said to be (α, β)-nuclear if the identity map between S ⊗α T and S ⊗β T is a
complete order isomorphism for every operator system T , i.e.

Also, an operator system S is said to be C ∗-nuclear, if

S ⊗α T = S ⊗β T .

S ⊗min A = S ⊗max A

for all unital C ∗-algebras A. For a C ∗-algebra A, A ⊗c S = A ⊗max S for every
operator system S ([10, Theorem 6.7]), that is, A is (min, max)-nuclear if and only
if it is (min, c)-nuclear.

PREETI LUTHRA AND AJAY KUMAR

Theorem 2.9. [17, Proposition 1.1, Corollary 2.8] Sn is (min, c)-nuclear but not
(min, max)-nuclear.

Remark 2.10. Since C ∗
e (Sn) = On is C ∗-nuclear (Theorem 2.1), using [7, Proposi-
tion 4.2] one can conclude that Sn is (min, ess)-nuclear. Further by [7, Proposition
5.2], for 1 ≤ n < ∞, Sn is not (ess, max)-nuclear, giving an alternate proof of the
fact that Sn is not (min, max)-nuclear.

One more fundamental C ∗-cover, the maximal one, is associated to an operator
u(S) introduced by Kirchberg and
u(S) satisﬁes the following universal “maximality” prop-

system S, namely, the universal C ∗-algebra C ∗
Wassermann ([13, §3]). C ∗
erty:
Every unital completely positive map φ : S → A, where A is a unital C ∗-algebra
extends uniquely to a unital ∗-homomorphism π : C ∗
Recall from [11], a subspace J of an operator system S is said to be a kernel if
it is the kernel of some unital completely positive map from S into some operator
system T . It was shown in [11, Corollary 3.8] that a subspace J of an operator
system S is a kernel of S if and only if J is an intersection of a closed two-sided
ideal in C ∗
u(S).
But the following result shows that C ∗

u(S) with S. This does create a curiosity regarding simplicity of C ∗

u(S) is never simple.

u(S) → A.

Proof. Let J ⊂ S be kernel in S, then by [11, Corollary 3.8], J = I ∩ S for some
closed two-sided ideal I in C ∗
u(S) is simple then either J = (0) or J = S.
But by [9, Corollary 6.12], any operator system with dimension greater than 1 has
a non-trivial kernel, a contradiction.

with the simplicity of its C ∗-envelope.
An operator system S for which σS is a ∗-isomorphism is said to be universal ([13]).
In particular, this property implies that if σS : S → A is any C ∗-cover of S, then
A ∼= C ∗

e (S). Thus preceding proposition implies the following.

u(S) ∼= C ∗

Corollary 2.12. There does not exist any universal operator system S with simple
C ∗-cover unless S = C.

In general, the isomorphism between operator systems need not extend to their

C ∗-covers; but the following result from [1] is quite useful.

Theorem 2.13. [1, Theorem 4.5] For S ⊆ C ∗
order isomorphism φ : S → T , there exists a ∗-isomorphism ˆφ : C ∗

enough unitaries of A if the unitaries in S generate A as a C ∗-algebra ([11, §9]).

3. Embedding of exact operator systems into O2

Motivated by Kirchberg’s exact embedding theorem (Theorem 2.3), we have the

following embedding theorem.

Theorem 3.1. Let S be an operator system with separable C ∗-envelope. Then
C ∗
e (S) is exact if and only if there exist a unital complete order embedding of S into
O2.

e (S) → C ∗

Proof. For the if part, let ψ : S ֒→ O2 be a complete order embedding. Then
using Theorem 2.13 there exists a ∗-isomorphism ˆψ : C ∗
e (ψ(S)). Consider
C ∗(ψ(S)) ⊆ O2, so that C ∗(ψ(S)) a C ∗-subalgebra of O2 is exact(Theorem 2.3).
Now by minimality property,
e (ψ(S)) is a quotient of exact
C ∗(ψ(S)) and hence is exact (Theorem 2.6(ii)). Therefore, under the ∗-isomorphism
ˆψ−1, C ∗
Conversely, let iS : S ֒→ C ∗
φ : C ∗
C ∗
of S into O2.

e (S) be the natural complete order inclusion and
e (S) → O2 be the injective ∗-homomorphism arising using the exactness of
e (S)(Theorem 2.3). Then φ ◦ iS : S → O2 is a unital complete order embedding
(cid:3)

its C ∗-envelope C ∗

e (S) is exact.

Corollary 3.2. For an exact separable operator system S containing enough uni-
taries of its C ∗-envelope, S embeds into O2.

Proof. By [11, Proposition 10.12], for the case when S contains enough unitaries of
C ∗
e (S) and hence result follows
by Theorem 3.1.
(cid:3)

e (S), exactness of S is equivalent to exactness of C ∗

Remark 3.3. In general, separable exact operator systems need not embed into
O2. In [13], Kirchberg and Wasserman gave an example of a universal separable
exact operator system S with non exact C ∗-envelope. Another such example was
recently constructed by Lupini in [14], namely, the Gurarij operator system GS,
which is exact but does not admit any complete order embedding into an exact
C ∗-algebra.

e (T1) and C ∗

Proposition 3.4. Let T1 and T2 be operator systems with separable C ∗-envelopes.
If C ∗
e (T2) are exact, then the operator system T1 ⊗min T2 embeds into
O2. Converse holds, if either both C ∗
e (T2) are simple or both T1 and T2
contain enough unitaries of C ∗

e (T1) and C ∗

e (T2), respectively.

e (T1) and C ∗

Proof. Let C ∗
e (Ti) be exact for i = 1, 2. Since min is injective and operator system
min tensor product of C ∗-algebras embeds complete order isomorphically into their

C ∗- min tensor product [10, Theorem 4.6, Corollary 4.10], using Theorem 3.1 and
Theorem 2.2, we have

In case, C ∗

which is separable (being the minimal C ∗-tensor product of separable C ∗-algebra).
Thus Theorem 3.1 implies that C ∗
e (T2) is exact and hence, for each i,
the C ∗-subalgebras C ∗
e (T1) ∋ a1 7→
a1 ⊗1 ∈ C ∗

Since min is associative ([10, Theorem 4.6]), preceding proposition can be ex-

tended to ﬁnite tensor product.
Corollary 3.5. Let T1, T2, · · · , Tm; m ∈ N be operator systems with separable C ∗-
envelopes. If, for each i : 1 ≤ i ≤ m, C ∗
e (Ti) is exact, then the operator system
T1 ⊗min T2 ⊗min · · · ⊗min Tm embeds into O2. Converse holds, if either C ∗
e (Ti)
is simple for all i or each Ti, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, contains enough unitaries of C ∗
e (Ti),
respectively.

Remark 3.6. In [9] Kavruk remarked that for exact operator systems S and T
containing enough unitaries of C ∗
e (T ), respectively, S ⊗min T is exact.
In general, it is not known whether exactness of S and T implies the exactness of
S ⊗min T .

e (S) and C ∗

Nuclearity properties of operator systems have been characterized in terms of
various intrinsic properties (see [9]), and their relation with the nuclearity of their
C ∗-envelope (see [7]) have been studied recently.
In the next corollary, we give
some nuclearity properties of operator system embeddable in O2.
Corollary 3.7. For an operator system S with separable C ∗-envelope, having an
embedding in O2, we have

(i) S is exact, and hence (min, el)-nuclear.
(ii) C ∗

e (S) is nuclear if and only if C ∗

e (S) has the DCEP. In this case, S is

(min, ess)-nuclear.

(iii) If S has enough unitaries of C ∗

e (S), S is (min, ess)-nuclear if and only if

C ∗

e (S) has the DCEP.

Proof.

(i) Since exactness passes to operator subsystems [11, Corollary 5.8.]
and (min, el)-nuclearity is equivalent to exactness of operator system([11,
Theorem 5.7], we have (i) from Theorem 3.1.

(ii) A unital C ∗-algebra is nuclear if and only if it is exact and has DCEP ([18,
§17] and [11, §7]; and nuclearity of C ∗-envelope implies (min, ess)-nuclearity
of operator system ([7, Proposition 4.2]), thus Theorem 3.1 implies the
result.

(iii) For an operator system having enough unitaries in C ∗

e (S), (min, ess)-nuclearity

is equivalent to nuclearity of C ∗
from (ii).

e (S) ([7, Theorem 4.3]), therefore (iii) follows

The characterization of simple, nuclear, separable C ∗-algebras by Kirchberg
e (S) for an operator

(Theorem 2.4), gives the following result when applied to C ∗
system S.
Proposition 4.1. For an operator system S with simple C ∗-envelope, the following
are equivalent:

(1) C ∗
(2) C ∗

e (S) is a separable and nuclear C ∗-algebra.
e (S ⊗min=c S2) ∼= C ∗

e (S2) ∼= O2.

Proof. (1) =⇒ (2).
Using Lemma 2.14, we have C ∗
Theorem 2.4, we have that C ∗
(2) =⇒ (1).
Since C ∗

have C ∗

e (A) = A ([7,
(cid:3)

Recall from [19, Deﬁnition 1.1.15], for unital C ∗-algebras A and B, two com-
pletely positive maps φ, ψ : A → B, are said to be unitarily equivalent if there is
a unitary u in B such that uψ(a)u∗ = φ(a) for all a ∈ A, in symbols φ ∼u ψ. If
for every ε > 0 and for every ﬁnite subset F of A there is a unitary u in B with
kuψ(a)u∗ − φ(a)k ≤ ε for all a ∈ F , then φ and ψ are said to be approximately
unitarily equivalent, denoted by φ ≈u ψ. Approximate unitary equivalence of com-
pletely positive maps has been used extensively in [19, Theorem 5.1.1] and [19,
Theorem 6.3.8] to prove various isomorphisms of C ∗-algebras involving O2.
Corollary 4.3. For an operator system S with simple and separable C ∗-envelope,
the following are equivalent :

e (S) is exact.

(i) C ∗
(ii) S ⊗min=c S2 embeds into O2.
(iii) C ∗
(iv) C ∗

e (S ⊗min=c S2) is exact.
e (S ⊗min=c S2) can be embedded in O2 as a C ∗-subalgebra.

Moreover, if any one of the above holds, then there exist injective ∗-homomorphisms,

e (S ⊗min=c S2) → O2
such that γ ◦ ρ ≈u idO2. And, in addition, if ρ ◦ γ ≈u idC ∗
e (S)
is nuclear and C ∗
Proof. Using the simplicity of O2 and the fact that C ∗
(i) and (ii) are equivalent.
Theorem 3.1 implies (ii) ⇐⇒ (iii).
Equivalence of (iii) and (iv) follows using Kirchberg’s exact embedding theorem
(Theorem 2.3).
Now, suppose S satisﬁes any of the above. Let ρ : O2 ֒→ C ∗
e (S2) =
C ∗
e (S ⊗min=c S2) ֒→ O2 be the injec-
tive ∗-homomorphism. Using [19, Theorem 5.1.1], we know that any injective ∗-
homomorphism form O2 into O2, is approxiamtely unitarily equivalent to idO2. So

e (S⊗min=cS2), then using [19, Theorem 6.3.8](ii),
e (S ⊗min=cS2) is isomorphic to O2 and hence by Proposition 4.1 result follows. (cid:3)

Remark 4.4. In case the complete order embedding S ⊗min=c S2 into O2, obtained
in (ii) of the above corollary is such that O2 is a C ∗-cover, then trivially C ∗
e (S⊗min=c
S2) = O2( 2.7).

Proposition 4.1 and Corollary 4.3 gives the following important result.

Corollary 4.5. For an operator system S whose C ∗-envelope is simple, separable
and exact but non-nuclear, C ∗

e (S ⊗min=c S2) is a proper C ∗-subalgebra of O2.

Recall from [19], a simple C ∗-algebra A is said to be purely inﬁnite if A is not
isomorphic to C and for every pair of non-zero elements a and b in A there exists x
in A such that b = x∗ax. In fact there are six equivalent conditions that are used to
deﬁne a unital and simple C ∗-algebra to be purely inﬁnite([19, Proposition 4.1.1].
On the lines of Proposition 4.1, using the Kirchberg’s characterization of simple,
purely inﬁnite, nuclear C ∗-algebras (Theorem 2.5), we have the following result.

Proposition 4.6. Let S be an operator system with simple C ∗-envelope C ∗
Then the following are equivalent:

Corollary 4.7. For an operator system S with simple, separable, nuclear and purely
inﬁnite C ∗-envelope, there exist a complete order embedding of S ⊗min=c S∞ into
C ∗

e (S).
Using the fact that for a unital C ∗-algebra C ∗

e (A) = A ([7, Proposition 2.3]), we

have:

Corollary 4.8. For any unital, simple, nuclear, separable and purely inﬁnite C ∗-
algebra A, C ∗

e (A ⊗min=max S∞) ∼= A.

e (S), if S ∼= S ⊗min S∞, then S is inﬁnite dimensional and C ∗

Corollary 4.9. For an operator system S with simple, separable, nuclear C ∗-
envelope C ∗
e (S)
is purely inﬁnite.
Proof. If S ⊗min S∞ ∼= S, proof follows from theorem 2.13 and Proposition 4.6. (cid:3)

Remark 4.10. Converse of the above corollary is not known. Note that Sn is
a ﬁnite dimensional operator system with purely inﬁnite and simple C ∗
e (Sn) =
On(Theorem 2.1). But Sn ≇ Sn ⊗min S∞.

5. Applications

The results proved in this article can be applied to some recently introduced
operator systems with known C ∗-envelopes to check their embeddability in O2,
and to describe the C ∗-envelopes of some operator systems obtained after tensoring
them with S2 or S∞.
Recall from [5], an operator system S(u) was associated to C ∗(G), the full group
C ∗-algebra of the group G for countable discrete group G, u being a generating set
of G as; S(u) := span{1, u, u∗ : u ∈ u} ⊂ C ∗(G); it was shown in [5, Proposition
e (S(u)) = C ∗(G). On the similar lines, another natural operator system
2.2] that C ∗

e (Sr(u)) = C ∗

r (G). Further, C ∗

was associated to reduced group C ∗-algebra in [7], namely, Sr(u) := span{1, u, u∗ :
u ∈ u} ⊂ C ∗
Kavruk et al. in [10] associated an operator system to a ﬁnite graph G with n-
vertices, SG as the ﬁnite dimensional operator subsystem of Mn(C) given by SG =
span{{Ei,j : (i, j) ∈ G} ∪ {Ei,i : 1 ≤ i ≤ n}} ⊆ Mn(C), where {Ei,j} is the
standard system of matrix units in Mn(C) and (i, j) denotes (an unordered) edge
in G. From the proof of [16, Theorem 3.2], we now know that, for a connected
graph G on n-vertices, C ∗

r (G) (see [7, Proposition 2.9].

e (SG) = Mn.

Example 5.1. As an application of Theorem 3.1, the following operator systems
embed into O2:

(i) The operator system S(u) ⊆ C ∗(G); where G is a ﬁnitely generated discrete

amenable group.

(ii) Sr(u) ⊆ C ∗

r (G); where G is any exact discrete group.

G = Fn, the free group on n-generators, Sr(un) ⊂ C ∗

In particular for
r (Fn) embeds into O2.

(iii) SG ⊂ Mn; where G is a connected graph on n-vertices embed into O2.

On the other hand, S(un) ⊆ C ∗(Fn) does not embed into O2.

The following applications are immediate from Theorem 2.1, Theorem 2.9 and

Corollary 4.2.

Example 5.2. C ∗

Example 5.3. C ∗

e (Sn ⊗min=c S2) ∼= O2 for all 2 ≤ n ≤ ∞.
e (Mn ⊗min=c S2) ∼= O2 for all n ∈ N.

We know that C ∗(G) is never simple unless G = C; as it always has a one
dimensional quotient coming from the trivial representation of G; and has an ideal
of co-dimension 1, called the augmented ideal. But for n ≥ 2; C ∗
r (Fn)(the reduced
group algebra of free group with n-generator) is always simple.
r (Fn) for n ≥ 2, then C ∗

O2 ∼= O2; where SG is the graph operator system.

Argerami and Farenick [2, 3] deﬁned operator systems generated by a single
bounded linear operator T acting on a complex Hilbert space H as the unital self-
adjoint subspace OS(T ) = span{1, T, T ∗} ⊂ B(H).

Example 5.6. Recall from [2, Proposition 3.2], for C× := C(cid:31){0} and ξ =
(ξ1, ξ2, . . . , ξd) ∈ (C×)d, the irreducible weighted unilateral shift with weights ξ1, ξ2, . . . , ξd
is the operator W (ξ) on Cd+1 given by the matrix

and C ∗
Therefore, OS(W (ξ)) and OS(W (ξ)) ⊗min S2 embed into O2 using Corollary 4.3
and C ∗

e (OS(W (ξ)) ⊗min S2) ∼= O2 using Proposition 4.1.
