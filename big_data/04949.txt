Abstract— This paper extends previous results on construct-
ing a direct coupling quantum observer for a quantum har-
monic oscillator system. In this case, we consider a complex
linear quantum system plant consisting of a network of quan-
tum harmonic oscillators. Conditions are given for which there
exists a direct coupling observer which estimates a collection of
variables in the quantum plant. It is shown that the order of
the observer can be the same as the number of variables to be
estimated when this number is even and thus this is a reduced
order observer.

I. INTRODUCTION

A number of papers have recently considered the problem
of constructing a coherent quantum observer for a quantum
system; e.g., see [1]–[4]. In the coherent quantum observer
problem, a quantum plant is coupled to a quantum observer
which is also a quantum system. The quantum observer is
constructed to be a physically realizable quantum system
so that the system variables of the quantum observer con-
verge in some suitable sense to the system variables of the
quantum plant. The papers [4]–[7] considered the problem
of constructing a direct coupling quantum observer for a
given closed quantum system. In [4], the proposed observer
is shown to be able to estimate some but not all of the
plant variables in a time averaged sense. Also, the paper
[8] shows that a possible experimental implementation of
the augmented quantum plant and quantum observer system
considered in [4] may be constructed using a non-degenerate
parametric ampliﬁer (NDPA) which is coupled to a beam-
splitter by suitable choice of the NDPA and beamsplitter
parameters.

In the paper [4], the quantum plant consisted of a num-
ber of quantum harmonic oscillators where the number of
variables to be estimated was allowed to be at most half
of the total number of variables describing the quantum
plant. However, the quantum plant was assumed to have
very simple dynamics corresponding to a zero Hamiltonian.
Then a quantum observer was constructed whose number
of variables was equal to twice the number of variables to
be estimated. In this paper we extend the results of [4] by
ﬁrst allowing for more general linear quantum plants with

non-zero Hamiltonians. Conditions are given on whether a
given set of variables of interest can be estimated via a
direct coupling quantum observer. Then a direct coupling
quantum observer is constructed whose order is the same as
the number of variables to be estimated when this number
is even. In the case that the number of variables to be
estimated is odd, the order of the observer is one more than
the number of variables to be estimated. Compared to the
result in [4], this is a reduced order observer. As in [4], the
convergence of the observer outputs to the plant outputs is a
time averaged convergence since the overall plant-observer
system is a closed quantum linear system.

II. QUANTUM SYSTEMS

In the quantum observer problem under consideration,
both the quantum plant and the quantum observer are linear
quantum systems; see also [9]–[11]. We will restrict attention
to closed linear quantum systems which do not interact with
an external environment. The quantum mechanical behavior
of a linear quantum system is described in terms of the
system observables which are self-adjoint operators on an
underlying inﬁnite dimensional complex Hilbert space H.
The commutator of two operators x and y on H is deﬁned
as [x, y] = xy − yx. Also, for a vector of operators x on
H, the commutator of x and a scalar operator y on H is the
vector of operators [x, y] = xy − yx, and the commutator of
x and its adjoint x† is the matrix of operators

[x, x†] , xx† − (x#xT )T ,

where x# , (x∗
adjoint.

1 x∗

2 · · · x∗

n)T and ∗ denotes the operator

The dynamics of the closed linear quantum systems under
consideration are described by non-commutative differential
equations of the form

˙x(t) = Ax(t);

x(0) = x0

(1)

where A is a real matrix in Rn×n, and x(t) =
. . . xn(t) ]T is a vector of system observables;
[ x1(t)
e.g., see [9]. Here n is assumed to be an even number and
2 is the number of modes in the quantum system.

The initial system variables x(0) = x0 are assumed to

satisfy the commutation relations

[xj(0), xk(0)] = 2iΘjk,

j, k = 1, . . . , n,

(2)

where Θ is a real skew-symmetric matrix with components
Θjk. In the case of a single quantum harmonic oscillator,
we can choose x = (x1, x2)T where x1 = q is the position
operator, and x2 = p is the momentum operator. The

commutation relations are [q, p] = 2i. In general, the matrix
Θ is assumed to be of the form

Θ = diag(J, J, . . . , J)

(3)

where J denotes the real skew-symmetric 2 × 2 matrix

can estimate the variables zp. However, we ﬁrst analyse the
quantum plant satisfying these conditions. Indeed, we ﬁrst
consider the controllability of the pair (Θp, Rp). Since Θ2
p =
−I, it follows that the corresponding controllability matrix
is given by

1

J =(cid:20) 0

−1 0 (cid:21) .

The system dynamics (1) are determined by the system
Hamiltonian which is a self-adjoint operator on the underly-
ing Hilbert space H. For the linear quantum systems under
consideration, the system Hamiltonian will be a quadratic
form H = 1
2 xT Rx, where R is a real symmetric matrix.
Then, the corresponding matrix A in (1) is given by

A = 2ΘR.

(4)

where Θ is deﬁned as in (3). e.g., see [9]. In this case, the
system variables x(t) will satisfy the commutation relations
at all times:

[x(t), x(t)T ] = 2iiiΘ for all t ≥ 0.

(5)

That is, the system will be physically realizable; e.g., see
[9].

III. ANALYSIS OF THE QUANTUM PLANT

In this section we will describe the class of quantum
linear systems which will be considered as quantum plants.
Also, we will analyse these quantum plants in order to
provide conditions under which there exists a direct coupling
observer which can estimate the quantum plant outputs.

We consider general closed linear quantum plants de-
scribed by linear quantum system models of the following
form:

˙xp(t) = Apxp(t);
zp(t) = Cpxp(t)

xp(0) = x0p;

(6)

where zp denotes the vector of system variables to be
estimated by the observer and Ap ∈ Rnp×np, Cp ∈ Rm×np.
It is assumed that this quantum plant is physically realizable
and corresponds to a plant Hamiltonian Hp = 1
p Rpxp
where Rp is a symmetric matrix and Ap = 2ΘpRp. Here Θp
is of the form (3). Unlike the case in [4], we will not require
that Rp is zero. However, we will assume that det Rp = 0 so
that Rp has a non-trivial null space. In addition, we assume
that the matrices Rp and Cp satisfy the following conditions:

2 xT

Cp(sI − Θp)−1Rp ≡ 0;
p = 0;

CpΘpC T
The matrix Cp is of rank m.

(7)
(8)
(9)

Note that if the matrix Cp is not full rank then some of the
components of zp can be expressed as linear combinations
of the other components of Cp. Hence, without loss of
generality, we can eliminate these components of zp to obtain
a full rank Cp.

In the sequel, we will show that these conditions imply
that there exists a direct coupling quantum observer which

C = h Rp ΘpRp Θ2

pRp

. . . Θnp−1

p

= (cid:2) Rp ΘpRp −Rp −ΘpRp Rp

e.g., see [12]. This matrix has the same range space as the
matrix

Rp i
. . . (cid:3) ;

(10)

Cr =(cid:2) Rp ΘpRp (cid:3) .

The range space of the matrix Cr will determine which vari-
ables of the quantum plant remain constant if the plant is not
coupled to the quantum observer. These variables are ones
which can be estimated by the quantum observer. We can
use the matrix Cr to transform the pair (Θp, Rp) into a form
corresponding to controllable and uncontrollable subsystems;
e.g., see [12]. Indeed, we construct an orthogonal matrix P
using the svd of the matrix Cr as Cr = P SV T where V is
also an orthogonal matrix and S is a diagonal matrix. This
construction of P yields

P T ΘpP =(cid:20) Θ11 Θ12

Θ22 (cid:21) , P T Rp =(cid:20) Rp1
0 (cid:21)

0

where the pair (Θ11, Rp1) is controllable. Here Θ11 ∈
Rnp1×np1 and Θ22 ∈ Rnp2×np2 such that np1 + np2 = np.

We now use the fact that Θp is a skew-symmetric matrix
and hence P T ΘpP is a skew-symmetric matrix. Therefore,
we must have

P T ΘpP =(cid:20) Θ11

0

0

Θ22 (cid:21)

(11)

where Θ11 is skew-symmetric and Θ22 is skew-symmetric.
Also, since the matrix Θp is non-singular, the matrices Θ11
and Θ22 must be non-singular.

We also use the fact that Rp is a symmetric matrix. To do

P21 P22 (cid:21) and
this, we ﬁrst write P =(cid:20) P11 P12
P T Rp =(cid:20) R11 R12
0 (cid:21) .
0 (cid:21)(cid:20) P11 P12
P21 P22 (cid:21)

P T RpP = (cid:20) R11 R12

Hence,

0

0

= (cid:20) R11P11 + R12P21 R11P12 + R12P22

0

0

(cid:21) .

However, Rp is symmetric and hence P T RpP is symmetric.
Thus, the matrix P T RpP must be of the form

where the matrix Rp11 is symmetric. Also, since the pair

0

0

0 (cid:21)

P T RpP =(cid:20) Rp11
0 (cid:3)) is controllable, the condition (7) implies

(12)

that the matrix ˜Cp = CpP must be of the form

(Θ11,(cid:2) R11

˜Cp =(cid:2) 0

˜Cp2 (cid:3) .

(13)

where the matrix ˜Cp2 ∈ Rm×np2 is of rank m. From this, it
follows that the condition (8) reduces to the condition

˜Cp2Θ22 ˜C T

p2 = 0.

(14)

Now since Θ22 is nonsingular and ˜Cp2 is of rank m, it
follows that the matrix ˜Cp2Θ22 is of rank m and its null
space is of dimension np2 − m. However, since ˜Cp2 is of
rank m, the equation (14) implies we must have m ≤ np2−m
and hence we will require

m ≤

np2
2

=

np − rankCr

2

in order for the conditions (7), (8), (9) to be satisﬁed.

We now introduce a change of variables

˜xp = P T xp =(cid:20) ˜xp1
˜xp2 (cid:21)

to the system (6). It follows that

= 2P T ΘpRpP ˜xp = 2P T ΘpP P T RpP ˜xp

Θ22 (cid:21)(cid:20) Rp11

˙˜xp2 (cid:21) = P T ApP ˜xp
= 2(cid:20) Θ11

= (cid:20) 2Θ11Rp11 ˜xp1
˜Cp2 (cid:3)(cid:20) ˜xp1

zp = CpP ˜xp =(cid:2) 0

0

Also,

using (13).

˜xp2 (cid:21) = ˜Cp2 ˜xp2

It follows from (15) that the plant variables ˜xp2 will remain
constant while the variables ˜xp1 evolve dynamically for the
plant system. Also, we have shown that the variables zp to be
estimated must be chosen to depend only on the variables
˜xp2 and not the variables ˜xp2. This will mean that if the
quantum plant is a closed quantum system and not coupled to
the quantum observer, the variables zp will remain constant.
However, if the quantum plant is coupled to a quantum
observer, this may longer apply. In the sequel, we will show
that for a suitably designed quantum observer, the variables
zp will remain constant even when the quantum plant is
coupled to the quantum observer.

IV. DIRECT COUPLING COHERENT QUANTUM

OBSERVERS

We consider a reduced order direct coupled linear quan-
tum observer deﬁned by a symmetric matrix Ro ∈ Rno×no,
and matrices Rc ∈ Rnp×no, Co ∈ Rmp×no. These matrices
deﬁne an observer Hamiltonian

Ho =

and a coupling Hamiltonian

Hc =

xT
p Rcxo +

1
2

xT
o RT

c xp.

(16)

(17)

The matrix Co also deﬁnes the vector of output variables for
the observer as zo(t) = Coxo(t).

The augmented quantum linear system consisting of the
quantum plant and the direct coupled quantum observer is
then a quantum system of the form (1) described by the total
Hamiltonian

Ha = Hp + Hc + Ho

=

2

xT

a Raxa

(18)

where xa = (cid:20) xp

xo (cid:21) and Ra = (cid:20) Rp Rc

c Ro (cid:21). Then, using

(4), it follows that the augmented quantum linear system is
described by the equations

RT

˙xo(t) (cid:21) = Aa(cid:20) xp(t)
(cid:20) ˙xp(t)

xo(t) (cid:21) ; xp(0) = x0p; xo(0) = x0o;

zp(t) = Cpxp(t);
zo(t) = Coxo(t)

(19)

where Aa = 2ΘaRa. Here

Θa =(cid:20) Θp

Θo (cid:21) .

We now formally deﬁne the notion of a direct coupled

linear quantum observer.

Deﬁnition 1: The matrices Ro ∈ Rno×no, Rc ∈ Rnp×no,
Co ∈ Rmp×no deﬁne a direct coupled linear quantum
observer for the quantum linear plant (6) if the corresponding
augmented linear quantum system (19) is such that

V. CONSTRUCTING A REDUCED ORDER DIRECT

COUPLING COHERENT QUANTUM OBSERVER

In order to construct a reduced order direct coupled
coherent observer, we assume that the quantum plant satisﬁes
the conditions (7), (8), (9) and apply the transformation

˜xp2 (cid:21) = ˜xp = P T xp considered in the previous section.
(cid:20) ˜xp1

Also, we assume that the coupling Hamiltonian Hc depends
only on ˜xp2 and xo but not on ˜xp1; i.e., we can write

Hc =

˜xT
p2

˜Rcxo +

Hence, we can write

We now suppose that

no =(cid:26) m if m is even;

m + 1 if m is odd.

Thus, no is an even number and this corresponds to a reduced
order quantum observer.

We also suppose that the matrices Ro, ˜Rc, Co are such

that

˜Rc = αβT , α = ˜C T

p2, Ro > 0

(23)

where ˜C T

p2 ∈ Rnp2×m and β ∈ Rno×m is full rank. In

following the proof of a similar fact in [6]. First note that
the quantity ˜Ho(t) = 1

time. Indeed,

˜xo(0)T Ro ˜xo(0) ∀t ≥ 0.

(28)

where Θ11,

However, ˜xo(t) = e2ΘoRot ˜xo(0) and Ro > 0. Therefore,

it follows from (28) that

pλmin(Ro)ke2ΘoRot ˜xo(0)k ≤pλmax(Ro)k˜xo(0)k

for all ˜xo(0) and t ≥ 0. Hence,

ke2ΘoRotk ≤s λmax(Ro)

(29)

˙˜xp2(t) = 2Θ22αβT xo(t);
˙xo(t) = 2ΘoβαT ˜xp2(t) + 2ΘoRoxo(t);
zp(t) = ˜Cp2 ˜xp(t);
zo(t) = Coxo(t).

(24)

for all t ≥ 0.

We will show that

the given assumptions imply that
the quantity zp(t) = ˜Cp2 ˜xp2(t) will be constant for the
augmented quantum system (24). Indeed, it follows from (24)
that

˙zp(t) = 2 ˜Cp2Θ22αβT xo(t) = 2 ˜Cp2Θ22 ˜C T

p2βT xo(t) = 0

using (14). Therefore,

zp(t) = zp(0) = zp

(25)

for all t ≥ 0.

It now follows from (24) that

˙xo(t) = 2Θoβ ˜Cp2 ˜xp2(t) + 2ΘoRoxo(t)

= 2ΘoRoxo(t) + 2Θoβzp.

(26)

From this equation, we deﬁne the “steady state” value of the
vector xo as

¯xo = −R−1

o βzp.

Then we deﬁne the “error vector”

˜xo(t) = xo(t) − ¯xo.

It follows from (26) that ˜xo(t) satisﬁes the differential
equation

˙˜xo(t) = 2ΘoRoxo(t) + 2Θoβzp

= 2ΘoRo ˜xo(t) + 2ΘoRo ¯xo + 2Θoβzp
= 2ΘoRo ˜xo(t).

proved the following theorem.

Theorem 1: Consider a quantum plant of the form (6)
satisfying the conditions (7), (8), (9). Then the matrices
Ro, ˜Rc, Co constructed as in (23), (30) will deﬁne a
reduced order direct coupled quantum observer achieving
time-averaged consensus convergence for this quantum plant.

VI. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE

We now present some numerical simulations to illustrate
the reduced order direct coupled quantum observer described
in the previous section. We choose the quantum plant to have

In order to choose a suitable value of the matrix Cp so
that condition (7) is satisﬁed, we choose ˜Cp = CpP of the
form (13) where ˜Cp2 ∈ R2×4. Also, we require that the
condition (14) is satisﬁed. It is straightforward to verify that
this condition is satisﬁed by the matrix

˜Cp2 =(cid:20) 1

The quantum plant deﬁned by the matrices Rp and Cp
given above is a plant of the form considered in Section III
where np = 6, np1 = 2, np2 = 4, and m = 2. Hence,
we will construct a reduced order observer as described in
Section V with no = 2. In order to construct the observer,
we need to choose matrices Ro > 0, β and Co such that (30)
is satisﬁed. In this example, we will choose

Ro = I, Co = I, β = −I.

Then the matrix ˜Rc is constructed according to (23) as

The augmented plant-observer system is described by the

equations (19). To simulate these equations we can write

xa(t) = Φ(t)xa(0)

where Φ(t) = e2ΘaRat. Furthermore, the plant variables to
be estimated are given by

and the observer output variables are given by

zp(t) =(cid:2) Cp
0 (cid:3) Φ(t)xa(0)
zo(t) =(cid:2) 0 Co (cid:3) Φ(t)xa(0).

Although the quantities zp(t) and zo(t) are operators which
cannot be plotted directly, we can plot the coefﬁcients in the
above equations which deﬁne the components of zp(t) or
zo(t) with respect to the initial condition operators in xa(0).
In Figure 1, we plot these coefﬁcients corresponding to
the ﬁrst plant variable to be estimated. In Figure 2, we plot
these coefﬁcients corresponding to the second plant variable
to be estimated. These ﬁgures verify that the quantity zp(t)
remains constant at its initial value.

In Figure 3, we plot these coefﬁcients corresponding to the
ﬁrst observer output variable, which is designed to provide an

Figures 3 and 4, we can see that zo(t) evolves in a time-
varying and oscillatory way.

To illustrate the time average convergence property of
the quantum observer (20), we now plot the time averaged
quantities corresponding to Figures 3 and 4. In Figure 5, we
plot the time averaged coefﬁcients corresponding to the ﬁrst
observer output variable. Comparing this ﬁgure with Figure

of zo(t) converges to the ﬁrst component of zp.

In Figure 6, we plot the time averaged coefﬁcients corre-
sponding to the second observer output variable. Comparing
this ﬁgure with Figure 2, we can see that the time average
of the second component of zo(t) converges to the second
component of zp.
