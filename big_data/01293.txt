We develop an instantonic calculus to derive an analytical expression for the thermally-assisted
tunneling decay rate of a metastable state in a fully connected quantum spin model. The tunneling
decay problem can be mapped onto the Kramers escape problem of a classical random dynamical
ﬁeld. This dynamical ﬁeld is simulated eﬃciently by Path Integral Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC).
We show analytically that the exponential scaling with the number of spins of the thermally-assisted
quantum tunneling rate and the escape rate of the QMC process are identical. We relate this eﬀect
to the existence of a dominant instantonic tunneling path. The instanton trajectory is described
by nonlinear dynamical mean-ﬁeld theory equations for a single site magnetization vector, which
we solve exactly. Finally, we derive scaling relations for the ”spiky” barrier shape when the spin
tunnelling and QMC rates scale polynomially with the number of spins N while a purely classical
over-the-barrier activation rate scales exponentially with N .

INTRODUCTION

Computationally hard combinatorial optimization
problems can be mapped to classical spin glass mod-
els in statistical physics [1]. The energy landscape of
the corresponding spin Hamiltonians HP possess a large
number of spurious local minima. Classical optimiza-
tion strategies, such as simulated annealing (SA), exploit
thermal over–the–barrier transitions for the search tra-
jectory through the energy landscape towards low en-
ergy spin conﬁgurations. In quantum optimization algo-
rithms, such as quantum annealing (QA) [2–4] (see also
[5] for recent results) tunneling can play a functional role
by providing additional pathways to low energy states [6].
In an archetypical example of QA in spins models, the
state evolution is determined by a time dependent Hamil-
is a Pauli
operator for the j spin, and Γ(t) slowly interpolates be-
tween a large value and 0. At suﬃciently small values
of Γ all low energy eigenstates of H(t) are localized in
the vicinity of the minima of HP [7] (pure states in the
spin glass models). In QA the energy landscape is time
dependent and the energies of two minima can exchange
orders. Due to the tunneling between the minima, this
results in an avoided crossing with the energy gap ∆.

In the absence of an environment and for suﬃciently
slow evolutions, QA corresponds to an adiabatic evolu-
tion where the system closely follows the instantaneous
ground state of H(t) [3]. The state dynamics can be de-
scribed as a cascade of Landau–Zenner transitions at the
avoided crossings.

The interaction with an environment can suppress tun-
neling between two given states of the system. The rate
of incoherent tunneling decay is W ∝ ∆2/(2γ) when the
relaxation rate γ due to environment is much larger then

the energy gap, i.e., γ (cid:29) ∆/. However, the environment
also gives rise to thermal excitations to higher energy lev-
els from where the system can tunnel faster [8]. This is
called thermally assisted tunneling [9], and has recently
been discussed in applications to ﬂux qubit QA [10, 11].
We assume that the system with the microscopic
Hamiltonian H(t) has a free energy minimum associated
with a thermodynamically metastable state, and that the
incoherent tunneling decay rate W of this state is much
smaller than the smallest rate of relaxation γ towards the
quasi-equilibrium distribution in the domain associated
with this state.
Consider an eigenstate |ψn(cid:105) of H(t) localized in the
metastable domain. The energy of |ψn(cid:105) acquires an imag-
inary part, En − iWn/2, due to incoherent tunneling.
Thus, the partition function of the metastable state be-
n e−β(En−iWn/2)/
,
where β/ is the inverse temperature. For Wn (cid:28) En
we expand the partition function in Wn and express the
total tunneling decay rate W of the metastable state in
the form

where Re(Z0) is computed by neglecting the imaginary
parts of the energies. The quantity W introduced above
is given by the average over the micro-canonical decay
rates Wn weighted with the corresponding (quasi) equi-
librium populations. Due to the entropic eﬀects, the de-
cay rate W can have a very steep and non-monotonic
dependence on temperatures [8]. It can exceed the zero
temperature rate or even the coherent tunneling fre-
quency. Therefore, optimal protocols of QA must also
explore the ﬁnite temperature regime.

Tunneling transitions represent the bottlenecks of
QA [12] since the tunneling rate W decreases expo-

nentially with the size of the domain D of cotunneling
spins (typically, Hamming distance between the minima),
W = BDe−D α.

In this paper we investigate analytically thermally as-
sisted tunneling as a quantum computational resource for
an arbitrary temperatures. We compare the scaling expo-
nent α in the tunneling rate Wtunn to the corresponding
transition rate of Path Integral Quantum Monte Carlo
(QMC), which is a classical algorithm that is often used
to simulate QA in spin glasses [4, 5, 13, 14], and it is
the most eﬃcient algorithm to compute exponentially
small gaps at ﬁrst order phase transitions [5, 15, 16].
We also provide numerical evidence to support the the-
oretical ﬁndings. The numerical results address the case
of non-zero bias and ﬁnite (but small) temperatures, ex-
panding the numerical ﬁndings presented in Ref. [17]

We demonstrate in a closed analytical form for mean-
ﬁeld quantum spin models in transverse ﬁeld that the
transition rate WQMC of QMC and the quantum tun-
neling rate Wtunn have identical exponential scaling with
number of co-tunneling spins . This ﬁnding applies to the
situations where the tunneling is dominated by a most
probable path (an instanton). We will employ the path-
integral formalism, reminiscent of the one used in the
case of continuous [9, 18, 19] and spin [20] systems, such
as tunneling of magnetization in nano-magnets [21]. Re-
markably, despite the big body of literature in this topic,
spin tunneling has only been studied, using path inte-
grals, in systems with ﬁxed total spin. We will introduce
a non-perturbative spin path-integral instanton calculus
for systems where, due to thermal ﬂuctuations, the total
spin is not preserved. We augment our analytical results
by detailed numerical studies.

Finally, we compared the quantum tunneling rate, or
equivalently the classical QMC rate, with the transition
rate corresponding to a classical, purely thermal activa-
tion over the barrier. We considered the case where the
barrier has a form of a tall and narrow spike. We as-
sumed that the width and heigh of the spike scale at
most linearly with the number of spins N . We found the
relations for the parameter range of the two scaling ex-
ponents where the quantum tunneling rate (and the the
classical QMC rate) do not scale exponentially with N
while the rate of over-the-barrier thermal escape does.

In Sec. II we review the results for a thermally-assisted
quantum spin tunneling rate initially obtained in [8] using
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approach. In Sec. III
we developed a Kramers theory of the escape rate for the
QMC tunneling simulations. In Sec. IV we use path inte-
gral approach to establish a detailed connection between
the WKB results for the quantum tunneling rate and the
associated instanton trajectory and QMC escape rate.
In Sec. V we provide the results of numerical studies. In
Sec. ?? we apply the theory developed in this paper to
the tunnneling problem with small an narrow barriers.

A. Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approach

The thermally assisted tunneling rate Wtunn (1) in the
mean-ﬁeld models where the total spin quantum number
is not conserved was analyzed in Ref. [8] using the dis-
crete WKB approach [22]. We shall summarize below the
results in Ref. [8] for the archetypical model of a quantum
ferromagnet in an N -spin system [8, 23]

The mean-ﬁeld interaction energy density −g(m) in (2)
has a local and a global minimum. This class of models
are known to have large free energy barriers that lead to
exponential (in N ) slowing down for QA [8, 23, 24].

nential in N accuracy, the number of distinct irreducible

The Hamiltonian ˆH (2) has quantized eigenvalues ES,n.
Their dependence on the quantum number n for each

obtained using the discrete WKB approach [22, 23].

The eigenfunction C (cid:96)

m in the classically-forbidden re-
gion of m is obtained from the analysis of an auxiliary
classical one-dimensional system with energy e, coordi-
nate m and imaginary “momentum” ˆp → −ip that obeys
the Hamilton-Jacobi equation [23]

Then, to exponential accuracy in N , the amplitude of the
tunneling decay of the metastable state equals to

solution of the transcendental equation U(cid:96)(m) = e where

TUNNELING SIMULATIONS

A. Simulating tunneling via Quantum Monte Carlo

dynamics

The partition function Z of the model (2) at inverse
temperature β can be obtained by using the Suzuki-
Trotter formula to map a quantum problem to a classi-
cal one with one additional (imaginary time) dimension
τ ∈ (0, β) [25]. In the limit of inﬁnite number of Trot-
ter slices Z is given by an integral over the array of spin
paths σ(τ ) = {σj(τ )}N
j=1 where each path σj(τ ) = ±1 is
periodical along the imaginary time axis σj(0) = σj(β)
and parametrized by the locations of points (“kinks”) at
the axis where the sign of σj(τ ) changes [26]. The Gibbs
probability distribution over paths σ(τ ) has the form

and m = ai are boundaries of a classically-forbidden re-
gion (cf. Fig. 1).

In the WKB approach one can also compute the action
S(cid:96)(e) by introducing the instanton trajectory in imagi-
nary time t = −iτ for a system with coordinate m, mo-
mentum ip(cid:96), and velocity iv(cid:96). Since we have introduced
rescaled variables (7), we also have to rescale the time τ
in order to preserve the canonical relations

B. Transition rate for thermally assisted tunneling

Thermally assisted quantum tunneling is relevant to
the study of QMC, which is always implemented at ﬁnite
temperatures. The rate of the thermally-assisted tunnel-
ing Wtunn can be written in the form (1)

Here W(cid:96),n ∝ |Ctunn(e(cid:96),n, (cid:96))|2 is the tunneling decay rate
of the states with the set of quantum numbers (cid:96) and n,
and Ω(cid:96) gives the number of these states. In accordance
with the general prescription (1), each term in (19) is pro-
portional to the probability of thermal activation to the
states with the energies e(cid:96),n that subsequently undergoes
a tunneling decay.

In the limit of large N one can replace the summa-

the method of steepest decent. To the leading order one
simply needs to maximize the logarithm of the integrand
2 log[Ctunn(e, (cid:96))] + N Q(cid:96) − N βe with respect to (cid:96) and e
(here we used Eq. (5)).
In this way one replaces the
sum of the thermally-assisted tunneling decays rates over
many channels by the rate for the most probably channel
(optimal ﬂuctuation).

We refer to [8] for details of this analysis and simply

QMC samples from the Gibbs distribution (28) us-
ing the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm by implementing
a series of stochastic updates of the state vector of in-
dividual spin paths σ(τ ). At each QMC step a transi-
tion is proposed from a current system state σ(τ ) to a
new candidate state σ(cid:48)(τ ) based on a certain stochas-
tic update rule (often using cluster update methods for
paths σj(τ ) [26]). The rule is speciﬁc for a given im-
plementation of the algorithm however the ratio of the
acceptance and rejection probabilities of the transition
proposal pσ(τ ),σ(cid:48)(τ )/(1 − pσ(τ ),σ(cid:48)(τ )) is the same for any
implementation and equal to PG[σ(cid:48)(τ )]/PG[σ(τ )]. We
assume that the QMC updates of σ(τ ) occur at the se-
quence of random instants of time (t1, t2, . . .) sampled
from a Poisson process with a constant rate λ. Then
the stochastic time-evolution of the state vector σ(τ, t)
corresponds to the master equation for the probability
distribution function Pσ(τ )(t)

Quantum tunneling can be simulated with QMC using
a general approach that was ﬁrst considered in a QA con-
text [4, 5, 13, 14]. At t = 0 the QMC state vector σ(τ, 0)
is initiated in the vicinity of the metastable state basin
by uniformly sampling from the spin conﬁgurations that
j=1 σj(τ, 0) (cid:39) m0. Every
time when the state vector σ(τ, t) arrives at the vicin-
j=1 σj(τ, tf ) (cid:39) m1 the
QMC process is terminated. Repeating this experiment
many times one can determine the average escape time of
the QMC process from the metastable states m0, which is
proportional to the inverse of the escape rate WQMC [17].
The numerical studies of WQMC are described in Sec. V.
It is convenient to study the stochastic trajectories
σ(τ, t) by inspecting their projections m(τ, t) onto the
continuous functional space deﬁned in (32) (see Fig. 2).
At low enough temperatures the distribution P [m(τ ), t]
corresponding to the QMC dynamics (29) quickly relaxes
toward quasi-equilibrium (28) sharply localized in the
vicinity of m0. This relaxation process occurs with the
rate γ (cid:29) WQMC. The trajectory m(τ, t) spends a long
time (∼ W −1
QMC) near the metastable state m0. Occa-
sionally, a large ﬂuctuation occurs corresponding to the
escape event where the path m(τ, t) moves away from m0
and arrives eventually at the vicinity of m1 (see Fig. 2).
During the escape event the system initially moves up-
hill when the free energy F[m(τ, t)] is increasing until it
reaches the saddle point of the functional F to be denoted
as mz(τ ) that satisﬁes the equation

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)m(τ )=mz(τ )

δF[m(τ )]
δm(τ )

= 0, mz(0) = mz(β) .

(37)

Near the saddle point the escape path m(τ, t) slows down,
because the variation of F[m(τ )] is small. Then it goes
downhill almost deterministically, so that the free energy
F[m(τ, t)] is decreasing till the state m1 is reached. The
quasi-stationary statistical distribution over m(τ ) has the
Gibbs form PG[m(τ )] everywhere in the domain of the
local minimum except in the small vicinity of the saddle
point |F[m(τ ) − F[mz(τ )| (cid:46) β−1, where deviations from
PG[m(τ )] allow for the probability current ﬂow away from
the metastable state. This area lies inside the domain
marked with dashed line in Fig. 2. The probability for the
path m(τ, t) to reach the vicinity of saddle point that lies
inside this domain is PG[m(τ )] ∝ exp(−F [m(τ )−F [m0]).

This is precisely the Boltzmann factor that determines
the transition rate exponent in Kramers’ theory of escape
[27–30]

WQMC = BQMC e−βN ∆F , ∆F = F[mz(τ )] − F (m0) ,
(38)
where ∆F (cid:29) β−1 and BQMC is a prefactor (polynomial
in N ) that depends on the speciﬁc path update rule used
in QMC.

The connection between the saddle points of the free
energy functional in a classical one-dimensional ﬁeld the-
ory and the instantons in the corresponding quantum
mechanical tunneling problem was ﬁrst established using
the path-integral formalism in [27, 31] for the case of a
particle in a potential. To apply the same argument to
our mean-ﬁeld quantum spin problem we use the par-
tition function Z0 associated with the Hamiltonian (2)
in a form of the path integral normalization factor for
PG[m(τ )] (31). Then we express the tunneling decay
rate in a standard form (1) in terms of the imaginary
part of the partition function. For a large number of
spins N (cid:29) 1 this path-integral can be calculated using
the saddle point method within the instantonic calculus,
where the free energy functional F[m(τ )] plays the role
of the mechanical action. This gives

cape paths m(τ, t) depicted with blue lines. The most proba-
ble escape path is shown with a solid blue line. It starts near
m0 and arrives at m1 crossing the vicinity of saddle point
mz(τ ) shown with a red dot. The dashed line depicts the
boundary of the region where F[m(τ )] ≤ F[mz(τ )].

IV. COMPARISON OF WKB AND QMC

TRANSITION RATES

Using the expression (32) for F, we can re-write

Eq. (37) in the form of the following two equations

Wtunn = Btunn exp(−βN ∆F)

(39)

mz(τ ) =

δ

δλ(τ )

log Λ[λ(τ )],

λ(τ ) = g(cid:48)(mz(τ )) ,

(40)

where the functional Λ[λ(τ )] is deﬁned in (33)-(35).

where ∆F is determined by (37) and (38). The dominant
contribution to the path integral is given by the instanton
mz(τ ). We will show below that the exponential scaling
of Wtunn and WQMC with N is the same. The prefactors
BQMC and Bturn are expected to be diﬀerent. Btunn can
be expressed entirely in terms of the free energy func-
tional F [m(τ )] while BQMC depends on the speciﬁc path
update rule used in QMC.

To complete our analysis we would like to relate our
ﬁndings to the WKB analysis of thermally assisted tun-
neling presented in Sec. II. We will now show in an ex-
plicit analytical form that the exponential scaling coeﬃ-
cient β∆F of the QMC transition rate with N and the
QMC saddle point solution mz(τ ) are identical to, re-
spectively, the exponential scaling coeﬃcient α (20) of
the WKB tunneling rate with N and the WKB instan-
ton tunneling path mWKB(τ ) (16).

Such analysis is of interest because unlike the extrema
of the free energy function (36) that obey the “static”
condition m(τ ) = m0,1, the saddle-point (instanton)
trajectories mz(τ ) are time-dependent. They also ap-
pear in the context of the QA in mean-ﬁeld spin models
[23, 24, 32, 33] of the type given in (2).

We now introduce a vector-function in imaginary time
m(τ )=(mx(τ ), my(τ ), mz(τ )) corresponding to expecta-
tion values of the operator σ for the spin-1/2 particle
deﬁned as

Tr(cid:0)K β,τ σK τ,0(cid:1)

Tr K β,0

m(τ ) =

δB(τ )

log TrK β,0[B(τ )] ,

(41)

where B(τ ) is deﬁned in Eq. (35). We recognize that
Eq. (40) corresponds to the z-component of the vectorial
equation (41).

Diﬀerentiating this equation with respect to τ and us-

ing (35), we obtain

Tr(cid:0)K β,τ [H0(τ ), σ]K τ,0(cid:1)

One can re-write this equation in the following form

H0(m) = −Γmx − g(mz) .

(43)

(44)

(50)

Using the identity (56), the self-consistent condition (51)
can be simpliﬁed to

(56)

(57)

(58)

and we observe that B(τ ) = ∂H0[m(τ )]/∂m(τ ). We have
to solve this equation with the periodic boundary condi-
tion m(0) = m(β) (cf. (37)).

Equation (43) allows for two integrals of motion

H0(m) = e,

m(τ ) · m(τ ) = (cid:96)2

(45)

(46)

where m(τ ) · m(τ ) ≡ m2
solution of (43) can be written in the following form:

x(τ ) + m2

y(τ ) + m2

z(τ ). Then the

mx =(cid:112)(cid:96)2 − m2
my = −i(cid:112)(cid:96)2 − m2

z sinh p(cid:96)(m, e) ,

= 2v(cid:96)(e, m) ,

where p(cid:96) and v(cid:96) are given in Eqs. (10) and (16), respec-
tively. The equation for mz(τ ) is identical to that for the
WKB instanton trajectory mWKB(τ ) deﬁned in (16).

Because (cid:96) is a constant of motion, its value can be

determined at τ = 0,

(cid:96) =

Tr K β,0

(cid:115) (cid:88)

j=x,y,z

(cid:0) Tr(K β,0 σj)(cid:1)2

Since the propagator K β,0 depends on (cid:96), Eq. (50) is a
self-consistent condition.

A. The equivalence of WKB and QMC instanton

trajectories

We have shown above that the saddle point of QMC
satisﬁes the same diﬀerential equations (49) and (16) as
the WKB instanton. What remains to be shown is that
the optimal value of (cid:96) for the WKB approach coincides
with that given by the self-consistent condition of QMC
(50). In the WKB approach, the optimal value of (cid:96) can
be determined by the conditions (26) and (27). In this
section, we express the self-consistent condition for QMC
in the same form as the corresponding condition in WKB
to demonstrate their equivalence.

It is useful to introduce a replica qubit, which allows

us to write the self-consistent condition (50) as
σj ⊗ σj

(cid:96)2(Tr K β)2 = Tr

where K β ≡ K β,0 and PS (PA) is the projector onto the
symmetric (anti-symmetric) subspace of the two qubits.
To analyze the double propagator K β ⊗ K β, we consider
the Hamiltonian

0 = H0 ⊗ I + I ⊗ H0, H0 = −Γσx − g(cid:48)(mz)σz
H (2)

where H0 was already introduced in Eq. (35). With the
Bell basis | Φ+ (cid:105) = 1√

(55)
The anti-symmetric singlet state | Ψ− (cid:105)(cid:104) Ψ− | is a dark
state, and the triplet states are closed under such evo-
lution. As a consequence, the following identity always
holds

symmetric subspace of the two qubits,

(59)

where ξx, ξy and ξz take real values. Using Eqs. (52–
54), we have the following diﬀerential equations for the
coeﬃcients,

= −2i

dξ

∂H0(m)

∂m

× ξ ,

(60)

where m is determined by the instanton solution
Eqs. (47–49). Equation (60) is very similar to Eq. (43),
except that it is linearized. Thus, a known solution to
Eq. (60) is the instanton solution ξ(τ ) = m(τ ). Because
the instanton solution is periodic, m(0) is an eigenvector
of the propagator K β ⊗ K β with eigenvalue 1. To evalu-
ate the trace, we still need to know the other two linearly
independent solutions to Eq. (60).

We deﬁne the following symmetric bilinear form

B(cid:0)ξ(τ ), η(τ )(cid:1) = ξx(τ )ηx(τ ) + ξy(τ )ηy(τ ) + ξz(τ )ηz(τ ) ,

where ξ and η are two solutions to Eq. (60). The bilin-
ear form takes real values, and it is not an inner prod-
uct (there is no complex conjugate on ξy). It is readily

(61)

seen that the bilinear form is a constant of motion from
Eq. (60),

B(cid:0)ξ(τ ), η(τ )(cid:1) = B(ξ(0), η(0)) .

(62)

Let the other two solutions to Eq. (60) satisfy the ini-

tial conditions
x (0) = −mz(0) ,
ξ(±)

(0) = ±i(cid:112)m2

ξ(±)

Notice that

(63)

(64)

(65)

Because all the bilinear forms in Eq. (65) are preserved
at time β and m(β) = m(0), ξ(±)(β) must proportional
to ξ(±)(0) or ξ(∓)(0). The second possibility can be ruled
out by noticing that the signs of iξ(±)
(τ ) cannot change
during the evolution, because iξ(±)
(τ ) (cid:54)= 0 for all τ ∈
[0, β]. As a result, we have

The solution to the above quadratic equation is

With the three eigenvalues of the double propagator all
solved, we have

(cid:1) = 1 + 2 cosh(cid:0)2I(cid:1) .

Putting the above result into Eq. (58), we have

Tr(K β ⊗ K βPS

(cid:115)

cosh(cid:0)2I(cid:1) + 1

(74)

(75)

The integral I deﬁned in Eq. (72) takes the same form
as Eq. (27), although there is a time scale diﬀerence of 2
between the two. Comparing Eqs. (26) and (75), we con-
clude that the optimal value of (cid:96) in the WKB approach
equals to the self-consistent solution of (cid:96) in the QMC
approach.

B. The equivalence of the WKB and QMC scaling

of transition rate with the number of spins

Taking into account the expression for I = tan−1 (cid:96) de-
ﬁned in Eq. (72), after some transformations the WKB
action (14) for the extremal trajectory corresponding to
the instanton solution (49) can be re-written in the fol-
lowing form:

0

[mz(τ )λ(τ ) − g(mz(τ ))] dτ .

S(cid:96) = −βe − (cid:96)I +
where λ(τ ) = g(cid:48)(mz(τ )) is given in (40). Using Eq. (74),
we have the trace of the QMC propagator,
(Tr K β)2 = Tr(K β ⊗ K βPS
or equivalently,

(cid:1) + 1 = 2 + 2 cosh(cid:0)2I(cid:1) (77)

(79)

From (76) and (79) the QMC free energy (32) takes the

After the minimization over (cid:96) and e is performed, this has
exactly the same form as the expression for the eﬀective
free-energy in the exponent of the WKB transition rate
(21)

F[mz(τ )] = F .

min
e,(cid:96)

To complete the comparison we note that the static
free energy per spin F0 that appears in (20) equals to the
free energy density F (m0) from (38). Indeed, those are
merely two diﬀerent expressions for the free energy per
spin of the metastable state m = m0. Connecting them
requires a cumbersome but straightforward calculation
given in Appendix. With that we can establish that

β∆F = α ,

[cf. (20) and (38)]. Thus, we have shown the equivalence
of the exponential factors in WKB and QMC transition
rate expressions.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section we compare the analytical result for the
tunneling escape rate based on Eq. (20) with the QMC
escape rate obtained through numerical simulations per-
formed with continuous-time Path Integral Quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) [34]. We study the quantum Curie-
Weiss model with the Hamiltonian (2), where g(m) is
given in (12). The corresponding eﬀective potential
U(cid:96)(m) for (cid:96) = 2S/N = 1 is depicted in Fig. 1.

We follow the same method as in Ref. [17] to obtain the
exponential scaling with N in the numerical decay rate
in QMC simulations, WQMC ∝ exp(−αN ). However,
we extend the study [17] to the cases of nonzero biases
and ﬁnite temperatures. We initialize all spin worldlines
in the neighborhood of the higher (left) local minima of
U(cid:96)(m) by setting σj(τ ) = −1. We measure the number of
QMC sweeps (deﬁned as one attempted update per spin
worldline) required to decay from the metastable state.
This is done by counting the number of sweeps until at
least 25% of the replicas reverse their magnetization to
σj(τ ) = 1 [35]. We obtain the average number of sweeps
required for a given number of spins N by repeating this
measurement a large number of times. This was done for
N ∈ {8, 10, 12, 14, 16}. The dependence of the number of
sweeps on N is well ﬁtted by the expression exp(αN )/N
(see Ref. [17]). We ﬁnally obtain the exponent α from the
exponential ﬁt with 12 ≤ N ≤ 16. In Fig. 3a and 3b the
exponent α obtained from numerical QMC simulations is
compared to that obtained from the analytical approach
developed in the previous sections.

For the analytical value, we solve numerically the rate
for thermally assisted tunneling from the expressions (32)
and (39) (their equivalence to the WKB result (20) was
shown in the previous section). We use the instanton
solution Eq. (16) for a particular (cid:96) = (cid:96)1 to construct the
2-dimensional matrix H0(τ ) in Eq. (35), where λ(τ ) is

9

a function of the instanton solution. The 2-dimensional
matrix H0(τ ) is then used to calculate the propagator
Eq. (34). Knowing the propagator allows one to calculate
If (cid:96)1 (cid:54)= (cid:96)2, the original value (cid:96)1 is
(cid:96)2 using Eq. (50).
modiﬁed until it equals to the corresponding (cid:96)2; this value
(cid:96)1 = (cid:96)2 is the self-consistent solution (cid:96)∗. The free energy
F[mz(τ )] of the instanton trajectory with (cid:96)∗ (the saddle
point) can thus be calculated using Eq. (32). The static
free energy for the metastable state F (m0) is calculated
by minimizing F (m) in Eq. (36) over m. It can be shown
analytically that the extreme points of Eq. (36) equal
to those of the eﬀective potential (after optimizing over
(cid:96)). The escape rate β(F[mz(τ )] − F (m0)) given in (32),
(39) is proportional to the diﬀerence of the instanton free
energy and the static free energy corresponding to the
local minimum.

VI. PROBLEMS WITH SMALL AND NARROW

BARRIER

It is instructive to compare the quantum tunneling
rate, or equivalently the classical QMC rate, with the
transition rate corresponding to a classical, purely ther-
mal activation over the barrier. The later is the principal
mechanism for the transitions between states in Simu-
lated Annealing (SA) optimization algorithms.
In the
present framework that cost function is −g(m), which
has multiple minima separated by a barrier. As an illus-
trating example, we consider −g(m) shown in Fig. 4,

(cid:18) m − mb

(cid:19)

− g(m) = −g0(m) + ∆g f

∆m

(83)

which is monotonically decreasing except for the small
region around m = mb, where there is a narrow spike of
the height ∆g and the typical width ∆m. Problems of
this type were studied previously in [36–38].
The function f describes the shape of the spike (en-
ergy barrier), f(cid:48)(0) = 0, f(cid:48)(cid:48)(0) < 0. We set the following
relations

∆g = cN−χ, ∆m = dN−δ, χ < δ < 1

(84)
where c, d = O(1) are constants. The main results will
not depend on the speciﬁc form of the functions g0 and
f other than they are continuous and |dkg(m)/dmk| =
O(1) for k = 0, 1, 2. We also assume that f (q) → 0
exponentially quickly for |q| (cid:29) 1.
The global minimum of the cost function −g(m) cor-
responds to m = 1 and there is a local minimum just to
the left of the spike at mb − m (cid:28) 1 as can be seen in
Fig. 4. If we initially prepare the system in a state with
m < mb, then thermal excitations will cause an over-
the-barrier transitions with a rate that scales as e−N ∆g.
Therefore, Simulated Annealing solves the corresponding
optimization problem with high probability in time that
scales as exp(cN 1−χ).

During QA with the Hamiltonian (2), the transverse
ﬁeld Γ = Γ(t) is varied in time. It starts at suﬃciently

tunneling decay rate (20) and the scaling exponent for the QMC escape rate obtained via continuous Path Integral Quantum
Monte Carlo simulations. Both results are obtained for the the Curie-Weiss model (12) for diﬀerent values of transverse ﬁeld Γ
and bias h. The x-axis corresponds to diﬀerent values for the inverse temperature β. (Left ﬁgure): diﬀerent colors correspond
to diﬀerent values of the transverse ﬁeld Γ ∈ {0.4, 0.5, 0.6} for zero bias h = 0. (Right ﬁgure): diﬀerent colors correspond to
diﬀerent values of Γ ∈ {0.3, 0.4, 0.5} with h = 0.1. In both ﬁgures the · symbols with dashed lines correspond to the analytical
values while the × symbols with dotted lines correspond to numerical values. Error bars correspond to the numerical ﬁtting of
the exponent α in the numerical data.

large initial value of Γ (cid:29) 1 when all spins are polarized
in x-direction. Then Γ(t) is slowly reduced to zero at the
end of the algorithm. We consider the case of low tem-
peratures where thermal ﬂuctuations can be neglected
(see below). If the evolution is adiabatic then the sys-
tem stays at the instantaneous ground state of H(t) at
all times during QA. This state corresponds to the ir-
reducible subspace with the maximum total spin (cid:96) = 1.
At the end of QA the system arrives at the global mini-
mum of −g(m) corresponding to all spins pointing in the
positive z-direction.
1 − m2 − g(m)
(cf. (11)) is time-dependent as Γ(t) evolves during QA.

At the beginning of QA when the term ∝ Γ in (85)
is dominating, the system resides in the vicinity of the
global minimum at m0 = 0. At the end of QA the sys-
tem is expected to be at the global minimum m1 = 1.

In the vicinity of this point we have m0,1(Γc) (cid:39) mb.
The value of the eﬀective potential at the minima is
U (m0,1)(Γc)) (cid:39) −g0(mb).

To calculate the tunneling rate the action under the
barrier (14) needs to be calculated at the instanton tra-
jectory with the energy corresponding to the minima of U
at Γ = Γc. The maximum value of the momentum p(m)
(10) is reached at the “middle” point m = mb under the

Using the Eqs.

tions to be neglected in QA the temperature must satisfy
the condition

eb = U (Γc, mb)

(91)

where 2s0(eb) (17) is the period of the instanton mo-
tion under the barrier with the energy close to the bar-
rier top U (mb, Γc) and Γ = Γc. It can be immediately
seen from the equation for the instanton velocity (16)
and (84) that s0(eb) ∼ |g(cid:48)(cid:48)(mb)|−1/2 ∼ N−δ+χ/2 is de-
creasing and therefore the temperature Tc is increasing
with N . Therefore the rate of the tunneling transition
approaches the zero-temperature limit for any ﬁxed T as
N increases. Because the exponents in the quantum tun-
neling rate Wturn and the QMC transition rate WQMC
are identical, the later is also well approximated by the
zero-temperature limit when T (cid:28) T0.

Let us assume that the following condition is satisﬁed

(92)

In this case both the quantum tunneling and the QMC
transition rates can be analyzed using the methods de-
veloped in the former sections. They scale only polyno-
mially with N , because the exponent in Eq. (90) does
not depend on N . However, the rate of the purely ther-
mal transition scales exponentially with N . This implies
that, while quantum tunneling is exponentially faster
than classical SA algorithms, it still does not oﬀer scal-
ing advantages over classical algorithms for the situations
where the path integral is dominated by a single path
(instanton). We note that the above conclusion will hold
also for a broader range than that given in (92)

1 > χ ≥ 2(1 − δ) ≥ 0 .

(93)

In this case the QMC transition rate and quantum tun-
neling rate can only increase compared to the case (92)
while the thermal transition rate is still exponential. An
example of this situation is χ = 0 and δ = 1 corre-
sponding to the barrier in the interaction energy −N g(m)
that has for form of Kronecker-delta with the height that
scales as N . However neither WKB nor Kramers escape
theory (for QMC) do work in this case and the actual
transition rate expressions should be analyzed by diﬀer-
ent methods.

VII. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

In this paper we considered QMC simulations of
thermally-assisted quantum tunneling for an N -spin
mean-ﬁeld model. We demonstrated,
in a closed an-
alytical form, the equivalence between the exponential
scaling of the QMC transition rate and the actual physi-
cal tunneling rate with the number of co-tunneling spins.
This equivalence was established numerically in a previ-
ous study [17] in the eﬀective ”zero-temperature” limit
where the eﬀect of thermal excitations on the tunneling
rate can be neglected, and under the condition of zero
bias. In the present paper we provided a detailed the-
oretical description of the results of [17] and extended
them to the case of thermally-assisted tunneling at ﬁnite
temperatures and arbitrary biases. We also provided nu-
merical QMC study to complement theoretical results.

The ﬁndings of the identical scaling of QMC and quan-
tum tunneling seem counterintuitive at a ﬁrst glance;
incoherent tunneling decay is a non-equilibrium pro-
cess while QMC simulations describe ﬂuctuations around
equilibria. In mean-ﬁeld spin models the density of states
increases exponentially with energy therefore providing
for a large number of tunneling channels at ﬁnite tem-
perature (1). Both the quantum system and QMC simu-
lation process thermalize in the metastable domain much
faster then a Kramers transition or a tunneling decay oc-
curs. However it is not clear ahead of time that QMC
explores the decay channels in the same way as the quan-
tum system.

The rate of quantum spin tunneling can be written as
a product of a polynomial (in N ) prefactor and an ex-

	0	mb	−1	1	m	−g	Δg	Δmponential function. The exponential function dominates
at the large-N limit, and it can be determined by the
change in the eﬀective free energy functional F[m(τ )] be-
tween the values calculated at the instanton and the local
minimum [see Eq. (20)]. Tunneling can thus be described
by a most probable path (instanton) corresponding to a
single channel that minimizes the eﬀective energy.

The stochastic process in the QMC simulation sam-
ples the quasi-equilibrium distribution determined by the
classical mean-ﬁeld free-energy functional F[m(τ )] (see
Eq. (32)). The Kramers escape event in the stochastic
process describes the transition from a local minimum
to the global minimum, which is dominated by a sin-
gle “transition state” (a saddle point of F[m(τ )]) that
the system needs to reach in order to make an escape
from the metastable state. This transition state corre-
sponds to a quantum instanton, and the change in free
energy needed to reach this state is the same as that in
the quantum case. This explains the equivalence in the
exponential scaling of the QMC transition rate and ther-
mally assisted quantum tunneling rate.

We ﬁnd the solution to the instanton and the change
in free energy in a closed analytical form for a general
mean-ﬁeld quantum spin model with the Hamiltonian
ˆH = −2Γ ˆSx − N g(2 ˆSz/N ). This is achieved by estab-
lishing a detailed connection between the F[m(τ )] (32)
and the analysis performed with WKB method that deals
explicitly with the system eigenstates and takes into ac-
count the degeneracy of the collective spin states with
diﬀerent total spin.

We note that despite a substantial body of work on the
models of this type [23, 24, 32, 33] the closed analytical
form of the instanton based on the free energy functional
F[m(τ )] has not been obtained previously.

We think that the spin-instanton method developed in
this paper can be generalized to the case of fully con-
nected spin-glass models in transverse ﬁeld with ﬁrst or-
der phase transition such as the p-spin models with p > 2.
Speciﬁcally, the mathematical approach developed in sec-
tion (IV A) can be used to calculate the instanton solu-
tions in the replicated free-energy within the one-step
replica symmetry ansatz [39].

We analyzed the problems with a narrow and tall bar-
rier in the cost function. Assuming that the barrier
height N ∆g = O(N 1−χ) and width N ∆m = O(N 1−δ)
we established that under the condition 1 > χ > 2(1 −
δ) > 0 the quantum tunneling and QMC rates scale poly-
nomially with N while the rate of purely classical thermal
activation over the barrier scales exponentially with N .
An interesting case 1 − δ (cid:28) 1 corresponds to a very nar-
row barrier. In this case the scaling exponent 1 − χ for
the barrier height N ∆g can be very close to 1 for QMC
and quantum tunnelling rates to be polynomial functions
of N .

Recently, Brady and van Dam [40] found numerical
evidence that QMC algorithms will succeed in the same
regimes where quantum adiabatic optimization succeeds.
More recently, Crosson and Harrow [38] considered a bit-

12

symmetric cost function with a thin, high energy barrier.
They proved that the Markov chain underlying QMC
ﬁnds the global minimum in polynomial time (in N ) if
the height of the barrier scales less than order N 1/2. The
also conjectured that this is true even for higher barriers
that scale as N .
We note that the result obtained in Ref. [38] refers to a
speciﬁc form of the interaction energy density −g(m) (2)
with a delta-function barrier and represents a particular
choice of the broad class of barriers discussed in our paper
where QMC and quantum tunneling scales polynomially.
In passing, we would like to brieﬂy mention several ar-
eas open for further investigation where obstructions for
the eﬃcient simulation of quantum tunneling with QMC
might exist. One of such obstructions is that QMC is
not always ergodic. QMC performs dynamics of paths,
which is not a representation of the dynamics of the corre-
sponding system. A well known problem resulting from
this is that QMC might have conserved quantities not
present in the physical system, such as the number of
world lines (particles, magnetization), braiding, or wind-
ing numbers [41, 42].

QMC may also be less eﬃcient compared to QA in
the optimization problems that require multidimensional
tunneling to reach the solution. Often in these prob-
lems the semiclassical action under the barrier S(x) is
not purely imaginary and displays complex features due
to the presence of caustics, non-integrability, and non-
analyticity. In this case no tunneling path can be deﬁned
and a Huygens-type wave propagation should be carried
out that involves both Re S(x) and Im S(x) [43, 44]. Due
to the highly oscillating nature of the wave function Ψ(x)
in the classically forbidden region, it is not clear if the
associated probability |Ψ(x)|2 can be faithfully recovered
with QMC.

It is an important open question how QMC will per-
form in comparison with QA in the problems that exhibit
many-body location/delocalization (MBLD) transitions
at ﬁnite values of transverse ﬁelds [45]. In the problems
with disorder and frustration delocalized states can ex-
ist in the range of energies with exponential many local
minima separated by large Hamming distances from each
other. A multitude of tunneling paths connects these
minima together and positive interference gives rise to
extended states in the space of spin conﬁgurations above
the mobility edge [46]. It is interesting to explore if the
properties of the delocalized phase are important for the
QA dynamics towards regions of lower energies where ap-
proximate solutions can be obtained in the vicinity of the
MBLD transition. In contrast, QMC tunneling, being a
classical phenomena, only connects a pair of minima at a
time without reproducing the positive interference among
exponentially many paths.

An interesting case where QA can have a scaling ad-
vantage over classical algorithms refers to the tunneling
in non-stoquastic spin Hamiltonians where the negative
sign problem prevents a matching QMC algorithm.

Finally, it was found in Ref. [17] that a version of QMC

13

with open boundary conditions can provide a quadratic
speedup compared to incoherent tunneling rate for the
Hamiltonian (2) (i.e. the scaling of QMC escape rate with
N matches that of quantum tunneling amplitude instead
of the rate). This result can be obtained analytically by a
direct extension of the present analysis, which is referred
to future studies.

[35] The choice of 25% is somewhat arbitrary. We ﬁnd that
waiting 25% or 50% of the replicas reverse magnetization
results in only small diﬀerences in the ﬁtting exponent
α. This diﬀerence is slightly larger for cases when the
number of sweeps for a transition in QMC is small.

In this appendix, we show that the static free energy

energy (36), the propagator Eq. (34) becomes

K β,0 = eβ[Γσx+g(cid:48)(m0)σz] .

The condition for extreme points of the static free energy
Eq. (36) is

where we use Eq. (95) to simplify the above expression.
Solving g(cid:48)(m) from the above equation, we have

g(cid:48)(m) = Γm ((cid:96)2 − m2)−1/2 .

(97)

Thus, the pair of equations (95) and (97) determine the
local minimum m = m0 and other extreme points of the
“static” free energy (36).

In the WKB approach, the eﬀective potential U(cid:96)(m) =

ε(cid:96)(m, 0) (8) takes the form
U(cid:96)(m) = −Γ

(cid:112)

which is exactly the static WKB free energy βF0 given
that we are using the optimal values of m = m0 and (cid:96) as
described above.

(98)

which is equivalent to Eq. (95) by using the deﬁnition of
the entropic factor Q(cid:96) in Eq. (5). Thus, we have shown
that the extreme points of the stationary solutions for
QMC and WKB are the same.

Using the conditions (95) and (97), the QMC free en-

ergy (36) at the extremum takes the form
