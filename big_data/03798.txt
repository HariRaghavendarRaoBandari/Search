ABSTRACT

We present spectroscopic observations of the nearby dwarf galaxy AGC 198691. This object is part
of the Survey of H I in Extremely Low-Mass Dwarfs (SHIELD) project, which is a multi-wavelength
study of galaxies with H I masses in the range of 106-107.2 M(cid:12) discovered by the ALFALFA survey.
We have obtained spectra of the lone H II region in AGC 198691 with the new high-throughput
KPNO Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph (KOSMOS) on the Mayall 4-m as well as with the Blue
Channel spectrograph on the MMT 6.5-m telescope. These observations enable the measurement of the
temperature-sensitive [O III]λ4363 line and hence the determination of a “direct” oxygen abundance
for AGC 198691. We ﬁnd this system to be an extremely metal-deﬁcient (XMD) system with an
oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 7.02 ± 0.03, making AGC 198691 the lowest-abundance star-
forming galaxy known in the local universe. Two of the ﬁve lowest-abundance galaxies known have
been discovered by the ALFALFA blind H I survey; this high yield of XMD galaxies represents a
paradigm shift in the search for extremely metal-poor galaxies.

that probes enrichment by successive generations of star
formation. Observationally-derived values of metallic-
ities for emission-line galaxies (ELGs) and H II regions
provide the anchor points for theoretical models of chem-
ical evolution in galaxies. The discovery and subsequent
study of the lowest metallicity systems, the so-called ex-
tremely metal-deﬁcient (XMD) galaxies, has long been
recognized as being of special importance. The XMD
galaxies provide some of the best links to the conditions
present in the early universe. They allow us to study
star formation and the properties of massive stars in ob-
jects that possess inherent similarities to the earliest star-
forming systems, as well as providing measurements of
primordial abundances as a direct test of Big Bang nu-
cleosynthesis models. The study of XMDs enables a rare
glimpse into key astrophysical processes occurring in the
early universe that would otherwise be observationally
inaccessible.

An XMD galaxy is classiﬁed as one presenting a mea-
sured oxygen abundance (used as a proxy for global
metallicity) of its interstellar medium (ISM) less than
or equal to ∼0.1 Z(cid:12), or equivalently 12+log(O/H) ≤
7.65 (e.g., Kunth & ¨Ostlin 2000; Kniazev et al. 2003;
Pustilnik & Martin 2007; Brown et al. 2008). The most
metal-poor galaxies known today have measured nebular
oxygen abundances corresponding to roughly 3% of the
Solar value (12+log(O/H) ∼ 7.15). Unfortunately, obser-
vations of such extremely low metallicity systems are ex-
ceptionally uncommon. Only four are known in the local
universe: the blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy I Zw 18
(Searle & Sargent 1972; Dufour et al. 1988; Skillman &
Kennicutt 1993), the starburst galaxy SBS 0335–052W
(Izotov et al. 1990, 1997, 2005, 2009), the irregular galaxy
DDO 68 (Pustilnik et al. 2005; Berg et al. 2012), and the
dwarf galaxy Leo P (Skillman et al. 2013).

Hirschauer et al.

Understanding the astrophysics associated with star
formation in extremely low mass and low metallicity sys-
tems depends upon the discovery and observational anal-
ysis of such systems. Observationally-determined metal-
licity relationships such as the luminosity-metallicity (L–
Z) and mass-metallicity (M –Z) relations are the conse-
quence of a fundamental correlation between a galaxy’s
population of stars and the evolution of its metal content:
systems with fewer stars generally exhibit lower heavy-
element abundances (e.g., Lequeux et al. 1979; Skillman
et al. 1989a; Tremonti et al. 2004). Because robust abun-
dance determinations are observationally challenging to
derive for the most intrinsically faint galaxies, and be-
cause these systems are harder to ﬁnd due to their low
masses, the current metallicity relations are substantially
underpopulated at the extreme low-luminosity end. In
order to provide constraints for theoretical models of
chemical evolution that will be representative of both
low-mass and high-mass galaxies, we require additional
high-quality metallicity measurements for systems at the
lowest luminosities.

There have been ongoing attempts to identify examples
of XMDs with measured metallicities lower than I Zw 18
(12+log(O/H) = 7.17 ± 0.0413; Skillman & Kennicutt
1993) and SBS 0335–052W (12+log(O/H) = 7.13 ± 0.02;
Izotov et al. 2009), but these eﬀorts have been largely un-
successful (e.g., Kunth & Sargent 1983; Kunth & ¨Ostlin
2000; Izotov et al. 2012). Since these two famous XMDs
were originally catalogued in surveys that selected ob-
jects that displayed some form of activity, much attention
has been focused on searching for galaxies that exhibit
the signs of extreme star-formation, such as strong emis-
sion lines. One example of a survey designed to detect
large numbers of XMDs is the KPNO International Spec-
troscopic Survey (KISS; Salzer et al. 2000, 2001), a wide-
ﬁeld objective-prism survey that selected objects via Hα
emission. Follow-up spectroscopy of over 2400 KISS
ELGs identiﬁed nearly 1900 star-forming galaxies, with
106 having luminosities fainter than MB = −17.0. All of
these galaxies have metallicity estimates (Melbourne &
Salzer 2002; Melbourne et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2004; Salzer
et al. 2005; Hirschauer et al. 2015), yet none have been
found to possess oxygen abundances below 12+log(O/H)
∼ 7.5. Surveys like KISS are very eﬀective at ﬁnding
galaxies with abundances in the vicinity of ∼0.1 Z(cid:12),
but have not found any objects in the elusive 0.03 Z(cid:12)
range. Systematic searches of the Sloan Digital Sky Sur-
vey (SDSS; e.g., Ahn et al. 2012) spectral database have
been somewhat more successful, resulting in a number of
identiﬁcations of galaxies with 12+log(O/H) < 7.5 (e.g.,
Morales-Luis et al. 2011; Izotov et al. 2012; Guseva et al.
2015) but none with 12+log(O/H) < 7.2.

The most recent addition to the XMD galaxies with
12+log(O/H) < 7.2 has been Leo P (Giovanelli et al.
2013; Rhode et al. 2013; Skillman et al. 2013; McQuinn
et al. 2013; Bernstein-Cooper et al. 2014; McQuinn et al.
2015b,c). Leo P has a measured oxygen abundance of
12+log(O/H) = 7.17 +/- 0.04 (Skillman et al. 2013).
Despite the similarity of its metallicity to I Zw 18 and
SBS 0335-052W, Leo P is a fundamentally diﬀerent type
of galaxy. With a luminosity of MB = −8.8, it is more

line ratios measured for the NW component of I Zw 18.

than 100 times less luminous than these famous BCDs.
Furthermore, Leo P exhibits a low surface brightness
stellar population, in contrast to the compact, high sur-
face brightness nature of I Zw 18 and SBS 0335–052W.
Finally, Leo P was not discovered because of its star-
formation activity or strong emission lines. Instead, it
was discovered in a blind H I survey.

Here we report on spectroscopic observations of the
dwarf galaxy AGC 198691 that have led to the recogni-
tion that it is an XMD galaxy with the lowest abundance
ever reported for a gas-rich extragalactic source. Like
Leo P, this object was detected in the Arecibo Legacy
Fast ALFA survey (ALFALFA; Giovanelli et al. 2005;
Haynes et al. 2011). It is included in the extended Survey
of H I in Extremely Low-mass Dwarfs (SHIELD; Cannon
et al. 2011). ALFALFA has provided the ﬁrst statistically
robust sampling of galaxies that populate the low-mass
end of the H I mass function (Martin et al. 2010), includ-
ing hundreds of objects with MHI < 108 M(cid:12). A subset
of these galaxies with 106 M(cid:12) < MHI < 107.2 M(cid:12) and
apparent optical counterparts found in the SDSS (Abaza-
jian et al. 2005), were selected for the SHIELD project.
The key goal of the latter investigation is to characterize
variations in the fundamental galaxy properties as a func-
tion of total halo mass. The SHIELD objects represent
some of the lowest H I-mass galaxies with an obvious stel-
lar population and probable star formation outside the
Local Group. Therefore, based on the standard M –Z
relationship, they are expected to be among the lowest-
metallicity star-forming galaxies in the local universe.
Our observations reveal that AGC 198691 possesses
an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 7.02 ± 0.03,
thereby earning the distinction of being the lowest metal-
licity star-forming system known in the local universe. In
§2 we describe the observational program carried out on
this object. Section 3 details the abundance determi-
nation, while §4 describes the physical properties of the
galaxy, compares this galaxy with other known XMDs,
and discusses the implications for the discovery of such a
low-abundance system. We summarize our results in §5.

2. OBSERVATIONAL PROGRAM FOR AGC 198691

AGC 198691 is part of the extended SHIELD sample
that was added to the original twelve SHIELD galaxies
(e.g., Cannon et al. 2011; McQuinn et al. 2014, 2015a)
as additional ALFALFA survey catalogs were completed.
This galaxy has been imaged as part of a Cycle 22 Hubble
Space Telescope (HST )14 program, and an H I map has
been obtained with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Tele-
scope (WSRT)15. Narrow-band Hα images were obtained
with the WIYN 0.9-m telescope16 as part of a larger pro-

Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute,
which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research

observations are associated with program 13750.

the ASTRON (Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy) with

(NWO).

gram to search for H II regions in the SHIELD sample.
These latter observations revealed a strong, unresolved
emission region in AGC 198691 that provided the target
for the spectroscopic observations reported here (Figure
1).

Figure 2 shows the HST image and WSRT H I
map of AGC 198691. The HST observations were taken
with the Advanced Camera for Surveys using F606W
(∼V ) and F814W (∼I ) ﬁlters. The optical appearance
of this system indicates a compact structure dominated
by luminous blue stars presumably produced in a recent
star-formation episode. The Hα emission detected by
the WIYN 0.9-m observations is located in the southwest
portion of the galaxy. The WSRT 21-cm radio synthesis
map is shown in the lower panel of Figure 2 overlaid on
the HST image. The 21-cm emission is only marginally
resolved in the WSRT map (beam size of 22 by 12.5
arcsec oriented north-south). The H I emission is well-
centered on the optical component and exhibits fairly
regular column density contours. There is a hint of an
extension to the south, but the reality of this feature is
questionable due to the poor resolution and low signal-
to-noise of the H I map. Forthcoming observations with
the VLA should be able to conﬁrm whether this struc-
ture is real. Results from the analysis of both the HST
and WSRT data will be presented in subsequent papers.
As part of an ongoing program to obtain spectra of the
H II regions identiﬁed in SHIELD galaxies (e.g., Hau-
rberg et al. 2015), spectroscopic observations were ob-
tained in April 2015 for AGC 198691 using the Kitt Peak
National Observatory (KPNO) Mayall 4-m telescope uti-
lizing the new KPNO Ohio State Multi-Object Spectro-
graph (KOSMOS). Subsequently, we acquired conﬁrming

2.1. KPNO 4-m KOSMOS Observations

Spectroscopic observations of AGC 198691 were per-
formed using the KOSMOS spectrograph on the Mayall
4-m telescope at KPNO on 19 April 2015. Our program
utilized both blue- and red-sensitive instrumental setups
that provided wavelength coverages of ∼3500–6200 ˚A
and ∼5000–9000 ˚A, respectively. This enabled the de-
tection of emission lines blueward to [O II]λλ3726,3729
and redward to [S II]λλ6716,6731. Unfortunately, our

servatory, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the
University of Arizona.

red spectral coverage did not quite reach the [S III] line
at λ9069 ˚A; this prevented us from determining a reli-
able sulfur abundance for AGC 198691. The instrumen-
tal pixel scale is 0.29 arcsec pixel−1 in the spatial direc-
tion. The dispersion for the blue spectral setup is 0.66 ˚A
pixel−1 while for the red it is 0.99 ˚A pixel−1. The spectra
were taken with a slit width of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)2; the slit extends 10(cid:48)
in the spatial direction. The sky conditions were clear at
the time of the observations. An image quality of ∼1.(cid:48)(cid:48)4
FWHM was derived from the measurement of stellar pro-
ﬁles in the object acquisition images.

AGC 198691 was observed using the blue setup with
three exposures and using the red setup with two expo-
sures, each of which were 900 seconds in length. The
slit was positioned along the parallactic angle as closely
as possible in an eﬀort to avoid the eﬀects of diﬀeren-
tial atmospheric diﬀraction (Filippenko 1982). The spec-
trophometric standard star Feige 34 (Massey et al. 1988)
was observed to provide calibration data for ﬂux scaling.
Wavelength calibration was accomplished using observa-
tions of a HeNeAr comparison lamp.

2.2. MMT 6.5-m Blue Channel Spectrograph

Observations

Our initial spectroscopic observations with KOSMOS
revealed that AGC 198691 was exceptionally metal-
poor. However, the large uncertainties in the weak
temperature-sensitive [O III]λ4363 line motivated us to
acquire a conﬁrming spectrum. Additional spectroscopic
observations of AGC 198691 were therefore obtained us-
ing the Blue Channel spectrograph on the MMT 6.5-m
telescope on 11 and 12 November 2015. Our program
utilized an overall wavelength coverage of 3690–6810 ˚A,
again enabling detection of emission lines blueward to
[O II]λλ3726,3729 and redward to [S II]λλ6716,6731. The
pixel scale along the slit is 0.30 arcsec pixel−1 and the
500 lines mm−1 grating yielded a dispersion of 1.19 ˚A
pixel−1. Our spectra were taken with a slit width of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0
on the ﬁrst night of observations and 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 on the second
night. The increase in slit width on the second night al-
lowed for the inclusion of more nebular emission. Seeing
values were estimated to be 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)8 on both nights.

Five

exposures of 1200 seconds were

taken of
AGC 198691 on night 1 of the MMT run, with six more
obtained on night 2. The spectrophotometric standard
stars BD+28 4211, G191-B2B, and GD 50 (Oke 1990)
were observed to provide calibration data for ﬂux scal-
ing. Wavelength calibration was accomplished using ob-
servations of a HeNeAr comparison lamp.

2.3. Data Reduction and Analysis

The data reduction for both the KPNO 4-m and MMT
6.5-m observations were carried out with the Image Re-
duction and Analysis Facility (IRAF)18. For both data
sets all of the reduction steps mentioned below were car-
ried out on the individual spectral images independently.
The fully reduced 1D spectra were then combined into
a single high S/N spectrum for the KPNO run and for

by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is oper-
ated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy
(AURA) under cooperative agreement with the National Science
Foundation (NSF).

smoothing) obtained using the KOSMOS spectrograph. The
inset box highlights the Hγ and [O III]λ4363 emission lines.
The increased noise between the Hγ and [O III]λ4363 lines
is due to the imperfect subtraction of the Hg λ4358 night
sky line. We stress that the night sky line does not overlap
with either of these two nebular lines in our spectra. Vertical
scaling has been reduced on the lower portion of the ﬁgure to
show increased detail.

each night of the MMT run prior to the measurement
stage.

Processing of the two-dimensional spectral images fol-
lowed standard methods. The mean bias level was de-
termined and subtracted from each image by using the
overscan regions. A mean bias image was then created by
combining 10 zero-second exposures taken on the night
of the observations. This image was subtracted to cor-
rect the science images for any possible two-dimensional
structure in the bias. Flat-ﬁelding was achieved using
an average-combined quartz lamp image that was cor-
rected for the wavelength-dependent response of the sys-
tem. For cosmic ray rejection, we used L.A.Cosmic (van
Dokkum 2001), taking special care that no emission lines
were “clipped” by the software.

One-dimensional spectra were extracted using the IRAF
APALL routine. The extraction width (i.e., distance along
the slit) was set to 11 pixels or 3.21 arcseconds for the
KOSMOS spectra and nine pixels or 2.70 arcseconds for
the MMT data. The extractions were conservatively
wide such that modest changes in the extraction width
result in negligible changes in the spectra. Narrower
spectral extractions can achieve higher signal-to-noise in
the faintest lines, but at a loss of spectral ﬁdelity. Sky
subtraction was also performed at this stage, with the
sky spectrum being measured in regions on either side of
the object extraction window. The HeNeAr lamp spectra
were used to assign a wavelength scale, and the spectra
of the spectrophotometric standard stars were used to
establish the ﬂux scale.

sured line ratios for reddening, following the standard
procedure (e.g., Osterbrock & Ferland 2006),

I(Hβ)

=

F (λ)
F (Hβ)

10−[cHβ f (λ)],

where f (λ) is derived from studies of absorption in the
Milky Way (using values taken from Rayo et al. 1982).
The ﬁnal cHβ value used for the reddening correction was
determined from a simultaneous ﬁt to the reddening and
underlying stellar absorption in the Balmer lines, using
all available Balmer line ratios. Under the simplifying
assumption that the same EW of underlying absorption
applies to each Balmer line, an absorption line correction
was applied to the spectrum that ranged in value from
0 to 5 ˚A. The value for the underlying absorption was
varied in 0.5 ˚A increments until a self-consistent value
of cHβ for the Balmer line ratios Hα/Hβ, Hγ/Hβ, and
Hδ/Hβ was found. This process led to the determination
of a characteristic value for the underlying absorption of
2.0 ± 0.5 ˚A.
Due to the velocity of the source (V(cid:12) = 514 km s−1),
the Hg λ4358 night-sky line falls midway between Hγ
and the crucial [O III]λ4363 temperature-sensitive auro-
ral line (see inset box in Figures 3 and 4). The placement
of the night-sky line does not interfere with the measure-
ment of either line, but residual ﬂux left over from im-
perfect sky subtraction does increase the noise at this
location.

3. ABUNDANCE ANALYSIS

Results of the emission line measurement and anal-
ysis, presented as reddening-corrected line ratios rela-
tive to Hβ, are listed in Table 1 for the KOSMOS spec-
trum, the individual night 1 and night 2 spectra from
the MMT, and the composite MMT spectrum. We have
opted to measure the lines from the two nights of MMT
data separately in addition to measuring the composite
spectrum. This provides a check of our results. Further-
more, the data obtained on the two nights are not iden-
tical, since diﬀerent slit widths were employed and the
telescope pointing may not have been precisely repeated.
The reader is cautioned that the MMT composite spec-
trum is therefore not necessarily a simple average of two
identical spectra. This is clear in the bottom lines of
Table 1, where the equivalent width of the Hβ line mea-
sured in the night 2 data is reduced relative to the night
1 value because of the broader slit used on that night,
while the integrated Hβ line ﬂux is higher.

We show the location of AGC 198691 in a standard
emission-line ratio diagnostic diagram (e.g., Baldwin
et al. 1981) in Figure 5. The ﬁgure shows AGC 198691
along with the four previously known XMD galaxies that
have 12+log(O/H) at or below 7.20 with reliably mea-
sured values (uncertainties of 0.05 dex or less). The line
ratios for AGC 198691 are those from the composite
MMT spectrum, while the values for the XMDs come
from the references listed in §1. Speciﬁcally, the line ra-
tios for I Zw 18 come from Skillman & Kennicutt (1993),
for SBS 0335–052W from Izotov et al. (2009), for DDO 68
from Pustilnik et al. (2005), and for Leo P from Skill-
man et al. (2013). As shown by Izotov et al. (2012)
the most metal poor galaxies occupy a restricted loca-

represents 45 minutes of integration with the blue set-
ting and 30 minutes with the red setting. The two inde-
pendent spectra are plotted together in the ﬁgure. The
break point between the red and blue portions is located
at ∼6200 ˚A, and is clearly evident by the change in con-
tinuum noise characteristics. The extraction regions for
the red and blue spectra were carefully matched to en-
sure that the same portion of the galaxy was being ex-
tracted. We checked to ensure that the ﬂux scales in
both spectral regions agreed by comparing the ﬂuxes of
the [O III]λ5007 line that was located in both the red
and blue spectra for our instrumental set-up. The ﬂuxes
agreed to within 7% on average for several objects ob-
served during this run. We scaled the ﬂuxes of the red
spectra to account for this 7% diﬀerence. The only im-
pact that this ﬂux scaling has on our results for the oxy-
gen abundance in AGC 198691 is on the determination
of the reddening parameter cHβ based on the Hα/Hβ line
ratio.

The composite MMT spectrum of AGC 198691 is pre-
sented in Figure 4. This ﬁnal spectrum was created by
averaging together the combined spectra taken on the
two nights of the MMT observations. The nightly com-
bined spectra were in turn the averages of the multiple
individual spectra taken on the two nights. This ﬁnal
composite spectrum represents a total of 220 minutes
(3.67 hr) of integration time.

For both the KOSMOS and MMT spectra the emis-
sion lines were measured using SPLOT by directly sum-
ming the ﬂux under each line. All spectra were mea-
sured independently by two of the authors as a consis-
tency check.
In all cases the individual line measure-
ments agreed within the errors.

For an initial estimate of the internal reddening for
AGC 198691 we calculate cHβ from the Hα/Hβ line ra-

tion in the traditional diagnostic diagram. The position
of AGC 198691 indicates that this galaxy has an abun-
dance in the same neighborhood as these other extremely

metal-poor systems. The low value of [N II]λ6584/Hα in
particular serves as a strong indicator of the exception-
ally low metallicity characteristics of AGC 198691.

Calculations of both the temperature and density of
the electron gas were carried out using the Emission
Line Spectrum Analyzer (ELSA) program (Johnson et al.
2006). The electron temperature (Te) was determined
by the oxygen line ratio [O III]λ4363/[O III]λλ4959,5007,
which exhibits a strong temperature dependence because
it arises from two widely separated energy levels in the
same ionic species (e.g., Osterbrock & Ferland 2006).
Metallicities derived based on the measurement of the
electron temperature are commonly referred to as direct
abundances. As can be seen by inspection of the inset of
Figure 3, the λ4363 detection for AGC 198691 from the
KOSMOS data is somewhat weak and noisy (S/N ratio
of 3.4), and great care was required in its measurement.
The uncertainty in the ﬁnal λ4363 line ﬂux is reﬂected in
the uncertainty in the derived value of Te. Our measured
value of the electron temperature based on the KOSMOS
data is Te = 20440 ± 3130 K. For the MMT data the
λ4363 line was more robustly detected, with S/N values
ranging from 9.5 to 13.6. This resulted in a more reliable
value for Te. Our measured value of Te for night 1 of
the MMT run is 18040 ± 1050 K, for night 2 is 19920 ±
1060 K, and for the composite MMT spectrum is 19130
± 800 K. We used the [S II]λλ6716,6731 doublet to derive
values of the electron density. As with the [O III]λ4363
line measurement, the weakness of the sulfur lines led to
fairly large uncertainties in our derived electron density
estimates.
In the case of the KOSMOS spectrum the
[S II] doublet yielded a ﬂux ratio that placed it in the
low-density limit; ELSA assumed an electron density of
ne = 100 cm−3. The three MMT spectra each resulted
in electron densities that were in the few-to-several hun-
dred cm−3 range. The derived electron densities and
temperatures are presented in Table 2.

We use the program ELSA to calculate ionic abundances
relative to hydrogen. We estimate the temperature for
the low-ionization O+ zone by using the algorithm pre-
sented in Skillman et al. (1994) based on the nebular
models of Stasi´nska (1990),

te(O+) = 2[te(O++)−1 + 0.8]−1,

where te are temperatures measured in units of 104 K.
The total oxygen abundance is assumed to be given by

following the standard practice. Additional ionization
states for other elements that are present in the nebula
but do not emit in the optical region of the spectrum are
accounted for with ionization correction factors (ICFs).
We use the prescriptions given by Peimbert & Costero
(1969) for the ICFs for N and Ne (see also Izotov et al.
1994):

ICF(N) =

ICF(Ne) =

N
N+ =

Using the ionic abundances and ionization correction
factors given above, we calculate the O/H, N/H, N/O,
Ne/H, and Ne/O ratios for each data set. These val-
ues are presented in Table 2. Note that we have chosen
not to report a sulfur abundance because we have only
detected lines from the S+ ionization state; sulfur abun-
dances resulting from only a single ionization state are
usually deemed to be unreliable. We have also decided
not to present a He abundance based on our current spec-
tra. This decision was made based on the weakness of
a number of the He I lines such as λ4471, λ4922, and
λ6876, plus the fact that in the lower dispersion MMT
data the λ5876 line may be contaminated by residuals
from the adjacent Na D night sky line. We plan to use a
high-quality follow-up spectrum obtained with the Large
Binocular Telescope to carry out an analysis of the He-
lium abundance of AGC 198691 in the near future.

The primary results

from our observations of
AGC 198691 are seen in column 4 of Table 2. The oxy-
gen abundance derived from our initial KOSMOS data
is 12+log(O/H) = 7.00 ± 0.05. The relatively large un-
certainty in the electron temperature based on the KOS-
MOS spectrum caused us to delay reporting our abun-
dance determination for this galaxy until we could obtain
a conﬁrming spectrum. As can be seen in the lower three
rows of Table 2, the MMT spectra do, in fact, reproduce
the low abundance implied by the KOSMOS data. The
spectra from the individual nights, as well as the com-
posite spectrum, are all consistent with AGC 198691 be-
ing the lowest abundance galaxy discovered to date. We
adopt the abundance derived from the composite spec-
trum of 7.02 ± 0.03 as our ﬁnal estimate of the oxygen
abundance for this system, but assume that subsequent
spectroscopic studies of this galaxy will reﬁne this value
further.

The nitrogen to oxygen ratio of AGC 198691 is consis-
tent with other low-abundance sources (e.g., van Zee &
Haynes 2006; Izotov et al. 2012; Berg et al. 2012). The

AGC 198691

7
derived value of log(N/O) = −1.51 ± 0.06 from the com-
posite MMT spectrum is slightly higher than the plateau
at −1.60 deﬁned for XMDs by Izotov & Thuan (1999),
but still lower than that of Leo P (= −1.36 ± 0.04; Skill-
man et al. 2013). Skillman et al. (2013) hypothesized
that in the case of Leo P there has been a period of
relative quiescence that has allowed for secondary nu-
cleosynthetic production of nitrogen to build up before
additional primary nucleosynthetic production of oxygen
took place, thus raising the N/O ratio. If this interpre-
tation is correct, then the implication for AGC 198691 is
that any similar period of lower star-formation activity
would have to be shorter in duration. This is broadly
consistent with its compact, BCD-like appearance (see
below).

The ratio of neon to oxygen is expected to be roughly
constant between galaxies regardless of their metallicity.
This is because both Ne and O are α elements, which
are produced primarily in core collapse supernovae. Nu-
merous studies have conﬁrmed this result (e.g., Izotov &
Thuan 1999; van Zee et al. 1998; Izotov et al. 2012; Berg
et al. 2012; see Figure 5 in Skillman et al. 2013). Our
value of log(Ne/O) = −0.78 ± 0.02 from the MMT com-
posite spectrum agrees extremely well with the results
from these previous studies. For example, the measured
value of log(Ne/O) for Leo P (Skillman et al. 2013) is
−0.76 ± 0.03.

4. DISCUSSION

With a measured oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)
= 7.02 ± 0.03, AGC 198691 is the most metal-poor star-
forming system known in the local universe. It possesses
a metallicity that is 0.11 dex (∼29%) below that of SBS
0335-052W, the galaxy that had previously been recog-
nized as having the lowest abundance (12+log(O/H) =
7.13 ± 0.02; Izotov et al. 2009)19. Adopting a solar oxy-
gen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.69 (Asplund et al.
2009), the metallicity of AGC 198691 is 0.021 ± 0.001
Z(cid:12)20. In the following discussion, we explore the prop-
erties of AGC 198691 based on our current knowledge of
the system.

4.1. Distance and Environment

The distance to AGC 198691 is not well constrained
at this time. In this section we present all of the infor-

19 In Izotov et al. (2009) the authors present two distinct spec-
tral data sets for SBS 0335-052W. The highest quality spectrum,
obtained with the UVES instrument, represents a single composite
spectrum of the galaxy and yields the oxygen abundance quoted
here. This value is consistent with a previous measurement of 7.12
± 0.03 presented in Izotov et al. (2005). The second spectral data
set, obtained with the FORS instrument, was spatially resolved
into four separate knots, three of which yielded direct abundances
of 7.22 ± 0.07 (their knot #1), 7.01 ± 0.07 (knot #2), and 6.86 ±
0.14 (knot #4). The FORS spectra are lower S/N than the UVES
data, resulting in larger uncertainties. The abundances from the
FORS spectra are all within 2σ of the UVES measurement, and
are consistent with a single, uniform abundance of 12+log(O/H)
= 7.13. Future higher S/N ratio spectra of the individual compo-
nents within SBS0335-052W are needed to establish the presence
of possible abundance variations; such observations would be in-
trinsically interesting and of high value in understanding the true
nature of SBS 0335-052W.

20 Steﬀen et al. (2015) have published a new solar oxygen abun-
dance of 8.76. Using this value results in a slightly lower value for
the abundance of AGC 198691 on the solar scale of 0.018 ± 0.001
Z(cid:12).

mation currently available that can be used to pin down
the distance to this galaxy. We also discuss brieﬂy the
environment within which it resides.

The distance to AGC 198691 obtained using the veloc-
ity ﬂow model employed by the ALFALFA team (Mas-
ters 2005) is 7.7 Mpc. This galaxy is located in the di-
rection of the “local velocity anomaly” (e.g., Faber &
Burstein 1988), so its ﬂow-model distance is likely to be
highly uncertain. If AGC 198691 is in fact at this dis-
tance, it is located within the so-called Leo Spur (e.g.,
Karachentsev et al. 2015), a sparsely populated structure
at a distance of roughly 7–10 Mpc. Since this is the only
signiﬁcant grouping of galaxies along the line-of-sight to
AGC 198691 within a distance of ∼20 Mpc, it is tempting
to assume that it is in fact located within this structure.
It is common practice to look for possible connections
between dwarf galaxies and other nearby galaxies that
lie along the same line-of-sight. There are a number of
galaxies with non-velocity-based distances that are lo-
cated close to AGC 198691 on the plane of the sky that
possess comparable redshifts.
In Table 3 we list nine
such galaxies that have angular separations of ∼6 de-
grees or less from AGC 198691. There are four galaxies
that have distance estimates of between 7.1 and 8.3 Mpc,
consistent with the ﬂow-model distance to AGC 198691.
Unfortunately, only one of these has a reliable tip of the
red-giant branch (TRGB) distance. The others have less
accurate distances based on the Tully-Fisher relation or
the brightest stars methods. The galaxy with the small-
est angular separation from AGC 198691 is included in
this group: UGC 5186 is located just 13.(cid:48)0 away, which
corresponds to a minimum separation of 31 kpc if the
two galaxies are both located at the distance indicated
for UGC 5186.
In fact, UGC 5186 is detected in our
WSRT H I map of AGC 198691. The other three galax-
ies in this apparent grouping have minimum separations
of between 300 and 820 kpc from AGC 198691, all con-
sistent with the ensemble representing a galaxy group
comparable in size to the Local Group at an average dis-
tance of 8 ± 1 Mpc.
The second closest galaxy to AGC 198691 on the sky
is UGC 5209, located 75.(cid:48)2 away at a distance of 10.42 ±
0.35 Mpc from the Milky Way (Karachentsev et al. 2015).
This object appears to be located on the far side of the

Leo Spur. The remaining galaxies in Table 3 have dis-
tances beyond 12 Mpc and all have minimum projected
separations of 1.0 Mpc or greater from AGC 198691. One
of these, UGC 5340, is also known as DDO 68 which is
one of the XMD galaxies referred to in §1 (12+log(O/H)
= 7.20 ± 0.05; Pustilnik et al. 2005; Berg et al. 2012).
We note the interesting coincidence that AGC 198691
and DDO 68 are separated by only 5.4◦ on the sky.
The HST imaging data described in §2 were obtained
as part of a larger eﬀort to ascertain the distances and
constituent stellar populations for 18 SHIELD galaxies.
The color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for AGC 198691
has been analyzed following the methodology of Mc-
Quinn et al. (2014) with the goal of deriving a TRGB
distance. The short exposure times obtained for this pro-
gram (one orbit per object split between two ﬁlters) re-
sult in a relatively shallow CMD. Thus, our TRGB anal-
ysis is unable to yield a reliable distance estimate. Either
AGC 198691 is nearby (distances less than 10-12 Mpc)
and its upper RGB is too sparse to yield an accurate
TRGB distance, or it is too far away for the TRGB to be
detected in our shallow data (distances greater than 12
Mpc). As we show in §4.2, if AGC 198691 is located at a
distance of ∼8 Mpc then it likely has a stellar mass com-
parable to or less than that of Leo P (Rhode et al. 2013;
McQuinn et al. 2013, 2015b). Consideration of the deep
HST CMD shown in McQuinn et al. (2015b) suggests
that a galaxy with a stellar mass signiﬁcantly lower than
Leo P might well have a RGB that is so sparsely popu-
lated that it may not be detectable in our shallow data
even at modest distances. Whether or not AGC 198691
falls into this category is currently unclear. At this time
we believe that the existing HST data cannot rule out a
distance to AGC 198691 as low as 8 ± 1 Mpc.

To summarize, we feel that one can make a strong case
for AGC 198691 being located within the Leo Spur at a
distance of 8 ± 1 Mpc, based primarily on a group as-
sociation with UGC 5186, UGC 5272, UGC 5427, and
AGC 205590. This distance estimate may or may not be
supported by our shallow HST CMD. The latter cannot
immediately rule out any distance in the range of ap-
proximately 7 to as high as 20 Mpc. We note that there
are galaxies over this full distance range listed in Table
3.

Figure 6 presents three plots showing the galaxy dis-
tribution in this region of space. The upper two plots
illustrate the distribution of galaxies with reliable dis-
tances in Supergalactic coordinates, while the lower plot
is a simple Hubble diagram and shows how the galax-
ies within 30◦ of AGC 198691 on the sky are distributed
in the velocity-distance plane. For the sake of clarity
we only include galaxies in the upper two panels with
SGZ less than −2 Mpc. The green line with stars at
8, 12, and 16 Mpc in all three plots shows the location
of AGC 198691 for the expected range of distances dis-
cussed above. Nearly all of the galaxies plotted in Fig-
ure 6 have secure distances based on the TRGB method
or other primary distance estimates. The exceptions are
UGC 5186 and UGC 5272, two of the galaxies that, along
with UGC 5427 and AGC 205590 (not plotted), make up
the putative group at 8 ± 1 Mpc. The circled points in
the upper two panels represent galaxies that have min-
imum projected separations from AGC 198691 of less
than 1.0 Mpc.

The uncertainty in the distance to AGC 198691 makes
it diﬃcult to place this system into the context of its
local environment with any certainty. Nonetheless, it
would appear that this galaxy is probably located in a
fairly low density region of the nearby universe. If AGC
198691 is in fact located within the Leo Spur it could
still be fairly isolated unless it were in close proximity to
one of the galaxies mentioned above. As seen in Figure
6, if AGC 198691 is located at a distance of 11 Mpc or
beyond then it is extremely isolated (no galaxies within
1 Mpc). We note that there have been suggestions that
low metallicity galaxies are preferentially found in voids
(e.g., Pustilnik et al. 2006, 2011).
If AGC 198691 fol-
lowed this trend then distances larger than 11 Mpc would
be preferred. Regardless of its actual distance, it would
appear that AGC 198691 (V(cid:12) = 514 km s−1) possesses
a large negative peculiar velocity and is participating in
the same velocity ﬂow as the other galaxies in this region
of the local universe (Karachentsev et al. 2015).

4.2. Physical Properties of AGC 198691

In this section we look at the physical characteris-
tics of AGC 198691. Since the distance is only poorly
constrained at this time, we present distance-dependent
quantities derived for a range of distances that should

bracket the possible values.

Table 4 presents relevant observed and derived quan-
tities. The location of AGC 198691 on the sky places
it within the boundaries of the constellation Leo Minor.
For that reason, our group has been referring to it as the
Leoncino Dwarf. The BVR magnitudes and colors are
obtained from the SDSS photometry for this galaxy (Ahn
et al. 2012) using the unpublished conversion relations
of R. Lupton.21 Galactic absorption corrections from
Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011) have been applied for the
computation of absolute magnitudes and luminosities.
The uncertainties listed include the formal photometric
errors from SDSS as well as the scatter in the regres-
sion relations. The Hα ﬂux is measured from our WIYN
0.9-m narrow-band images, which were reduced and cali-
brated following the procedures described in Van Sistine
et al. (2016). The angular size of the galaxy was mea-
sured from our HST images and takes into account faint,
extended low surface brightness emission that lies beyond
the central core containing the bright young stars and the
H II region. The heliocentric velocity (V(cid:12)), H I proﬁle
velocity width at 50% of the peak (W50), and H I ﬂux
density (SHI) are all from the ALFALFA survey measure-
ments of this source.

We present derived quantities in the lower section of
Table 4 for three distances: 8, 12, and 16 Mpc. We do
not quote uncertainties in these parameters since they
are dominated by the uncertainty in the distance. The
star-formation rate (SFR) is computed from the Hα lu-
minosity using the standard Kennicutt (1998) conversion
factor. The stellar mass estimates are derived using SED
ﬁtting methods as described in Janowiecki (2015) and
Janowiecki et al. 2016 (in preparation). These values
should be taken as being representative only. Unfortu-
nately, there are currently no NIR ﬂux points for this
galaxy which would allow for a more robust stellar mass
estimate via the SED ﬁtting method. AGC 198691 was
not detected in either the 2MASS or WISE surveys (e.g.,
Skrutskie et al. 2006; Wright et al. 2010). Furthermore,
the uncertainties due to the presence of strong emission
lines in the broad-band ﬁlter bandpasses complicates the
determination of the stellar mass via this method. It is

worth noting that the value for M∗ presented in Table
4 is consistent with estimates obtained using a stellar
mass-to-light (M/L) ratio method (e.g., Bell & de Jong
2001).

The color and luminosity of AGC 198691 reveal it to be
an actively star-forming dwarf galaxy. Furthermore, its
small size and high surface brightness appearance (Fig-
ure 2) allow us to classify it as a BCD (see Gil de Paz
et al. 2003). The blue absolute magnitude range of −9.75
to −11.25 makes it one of the lowest luminosity examples
of a BCD known. Most previously identiﬁed examples of
this class of object possess B -band absolute magnitudes
in the range −13 to −17 (e.g., Janowiecki & Salzer 2014).
The SFR, while low in an absolute sense, is quite high
for a galaxy with this luminosity (e.g., Lee et al. 2009).
This is again consistent with our proposed classiﬁcation
as a BCD.

One of the parameters that stands out with AGC
198691 is its very large H I to stellar mass ratio. The
ratio implied by the values in Table 4 is MHI/M∗ = 50,
which makes it one of the most gas-rich dwarf galax-
ies known. It is worth stressing that this parameter is
distance independent; the extreme value we derive will
not change as the distance to this source is reﬁned. For
comparison, the MHI/M∗ ratio for Leo P is 2.6 (Rhode
et al. 2013). Similarly, all of the SHIELD galaxies from
the Cannon et al. (2011) sample have MHI/M∗ ratios less
than two, and most are less than unity (McQuinn et al.
2015a). On the other hand, the MHI/M∗ value for AGC
198691 is similar to those for the extreme star-forming
galaxies I Zw 18 and SBS0335-052E (MHI/M∗ ≈ 75 for
both; Hunt et al. 2014). While the MHI/M∗ ratio in
AGC 198691 is lower than those of some rare massive
systems revealed by ALFALFA (e.g., Janowiecki et al.
2015), it is reasonable to hypothesize that the large H I
content of this system may very well play a role in its
extreme metallicity.

4.3. AGC 198691 and the Luminosity-Metallicity

Relation

The location of AGC 198691 in a luminosity-
metallicity (L–Z) diagram in relation to other XMDs

provides a powerful tool for understanding the physics
at work with this star-forming system. Figure 7 shows a
set of nearby galaxies with direct abundances taken from
the study of Berg et al. (2012) (grey points, her “Com-
bined Select” sample) plus the ﬁve XMD galaxies with
12+log(O/H) < 7.20. AGC 198691 is plotted assuming
distances of 8, 12 and 16 Mpc. The solid line is a linear
ﬁt to the data points from the Berg et al. study (her
equation (9)).

The exceptionally metal-poor systems SBS 0335-
052W, I Zw 18, and DDO 68 all lie substantially be-
low the ﬁt to the rest of the data. As discussed by
Ekta & Chengalur (2010) this may imply that the star-
formation mechanism at work in these systems is atyp-
ical, being aﬀected by the infall of signiﬁcant amounts
of pristine gas. The infall could both drive the observed
star-formation event as well as dilute the gas resulting in
under-enrichment relative to their luminosities. In con-
trast, the locations of Leo P and AGC 198691 lie far
closer to the extrapolation of the ﬁt line deﬁned by the
galaxies of the Berg et al. sample. This might be inter-
preted as an indication that these two systems are form-
ing stars in a manner more similar to expectation for typ-
ical dwarf irregular galaxies. The fact that AGC 198691
does exhibit a modest oﬀset from the extrapolated ﬁt line
as well as from the relatively quiescent Leo P could be
due to its BCD-like nature (i.e., a modest enhancement
in the B-band luminosity moves it to the left in the di-
agram). Alternatively, the gas-rich nature of this object
might be an indication that it too has experienced re-
cent gas infall that has reduced its observed metallicity.
In either case, the impact of these putative evolutionary
mechanisms is clearly far less dramatic than whatever has
impacted the three more luminous XMD galaxies shown
in Figure 7. The determination of an accurate distance
to AGC 198691 would provide valuable insight into the
possible mechanisms at play, since it would allow for a
much better understanding of the environment within
which this system resides.

4.4. Searching for XMD Galaxies

Figure 7. Luminosity-Metallicity (L–Z) diagram of galaxies
with Te-method abundances taken from Berg et al. (2012)
(grey points, her “Combined Select” sample). Highlighted is
AGC 198691 (red dots) and the four other known ultra-low-
metallicity star-forming galaxies (blue dots). Because of its
uncertain distance, AGC 198691 is plotted with three diﬀer-
ent values of MB, corresponding to distances of 8, 12 and
16 Mpc. The solid line shows the ﬁt to the galaxies from
the Berg et al. study. While the galaxies SBS 0335-052W,
I Zw 18, and DDO 68 fall considerably under the line, Leo P
and AGC 198691 are more consistent with the extrapolation
of the trend deﬁned by the Berg et al. galaxies, albeit at
signiﬁcantly lower abundance and luminosity.

As mentioned in §1 of this paper, there have been sig-
niﬁcant eﬀorts made to detect XMD galaxies through the
years. A large fraction of these eﬀorts focused on discov-
ering and observing star-forming dwarf galaxies with the
strongest levels of activity (e.g., I Zw 18 and SBS 0335-
052W). If the premise of Ekta & Chengalur (2010) that
these XMDs are strongly aﬀected by infall of pristine gas
is correct, we can now appreciate why these objects are
so rare. Existing surveys like KISS could not have failed
to discover additional examples of objects like I Zw 18
and SBS 0335-052W if they were present in the nearby
universe with even modest volume densities. The impli-
cation is that the physical processes that shape galaxies
like I Zw 18 and SBS 0335-052W occur only rarely. It is
also likely that the strong starbursts that are generated
by the proposed gas infall produce suﬃcient amounts of
new metals that the observed abundances increase back
to “normal” levels fairly quickly.

It is worth noting that AGC 198691 is located in the
area of the sky covered by the 3rd installment of the
Case Low-dispersion Northern Sky Survey (Pesch & San-
duleak 1986). The Case survey utilized objective-prism
spectra to select galaxies that had detectable emission
lines (usually [O III]), blue continua, or both. Most of
the objects cataloged in the Case survey were brighter
than mB = 18, suggesting that AGC 198691 (mB = 19.8)
was simply too faint to be detected by the survey.

A second method for searching for XMDs has been to
obtain spectra of H II regions in nearby gas-rich dwarf ir-

regular galaxies (e.g., Skillman et al. 1988, 1989a,b, 2003;
van Zee & Haynes 2006; Berg et al. 2012; James et al.
2015). The existence of the L–Z relation implies that the
observation of H II regions in the lowest luminosity galax-
ies should result in the discovery of numerous XMDs.
However, the shortcomings of this approach are readily
evident in Figure 7. The L–Z relation shown (solid line)
only reaches 12+log(O/H) of less than 7.20 for luminosi-
ties fainter than MB ∼ −9. Galaxies with this level of
luminosity have only been discovered in or very near to
the Local Group. Furthermore, their low masses imply
that even if they have retained an appreciable gas reser-
voir, the probability of catching them with current star
formation is probably fairly low. The obvious example
here is Leo P, which falls very close to the regression line
in the L–Z diagram. Leo P contains a single H II region
that is ionized by a single O star (Rhode et al. 2013;
McQuinn et al. 2015b). If Leo P were observed in 5-10
million years would it possess an H II region that would
allow a derivation of its metal abundance?

This second method of trying to detect XMDs can be
eﬀective but is mainly limited by our ability to catalog
large numbers of low-luminosity, low-mass galaxies in the
nearby universe. The work to date has been extremely
eﬀective at ﬁlling in the L–Z diagram at luminosities
brighter than MB ∼ −13, but has resulted in the mea-
surement of abundances that are typically higher than
12+log(O/H) = 7.5.

The fact that the two most recently discovered XMDs,
Leo P and AGC 198691, were both discovered in the AL-
FALFA blind H I survey immediately suggests a third
approach for searching for low-metallicity galaxies. The
extreme sensitivity of the ALFALFA survey has allowed
for the detection of hundreds of low H I mass galaxies
beyond the Local Group (e.g., Martin et al. 2010). Nat-
urally, any dwarf galaxy contained within the ALFALFA
catalog will have the raw materials necessary for forming
stars (i.e., cold gas). The SHIELD project (Cannon et al.
2011) was initiated to study in detail ALFALFA detec-
tions with the lowest H I masses that also possess a clear
stellar population. In the original SHIELD sample, nine
of the twelve galaxies are fainter than MB = −13, which
puts them into the regime of being interesting targets for
possible XMDs.

A ﬁrst attempt to derive metal abundances for the ini-
tial sample of SHIELD galaxies is described in Haurberg
et al. (2015). Only eight of the twelve galaxies in Can-
non et al. (2011) had Hα ﬂuxes strong enough to make
them viable spectroscopic targets. Of these, two yielded
direct measurement abundances, while for the remain-
ing six strong-line methods were used to estimate O/H.
One SHIELD galaxy was found to have an abundance
of 12+log(O/H) = 7.41, while the remaining seven had
12+log(O/H) between 7.67 and 8.08. In other words, the
abundances measured for the original SHIELD galaxies
are similar to those measured for other nearby gas-rich
dwarf irregulars. AGC 198691 was observed with KOS-
MOS on the KPNO 4-m as part of the second round
of SHIELD galaxy spectroscopy. The same observing
run has yielded several additional metallicity estimates,
including two with 12+log(O/H) between 7.3 and 7.5
(Hirschauer et al., in preparation). Many additional low
H I mass targets remain to be observed. The use of
the ALFALFA survey to pre-select low luminosity dwarf

galaxies as targets for follow-up spectroscopy is a remark-
ably fruitful approach to expanding the number of known
XMD galaxies.

5. SUMMARY

We have presented KPNO 4-m and MMT 6.5-m spec-
troscopic observations of the dwarf
irregular galaxy
AGC 198691 (a.k.a., the Leoncino Dwarf), which was
discovered in the ALFALFA survey and included in the
SHIELD sample of low H I mass systems. The analysis
of our spectral data has resulted in the derivation of a
“direct-method” oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) =
7.02 ± 0.03. This metallicity makes AGC 198691
the most metal-poor galaxy known in the local
universe. The oxygen abundance of this system is a
full 0.11 dex below that of SBS 0335-052W and 0.15 dex
below I Zw 18. While the spectra in the current study
were not suitable for providing an estimate of the helium
abundance in this galaxy, we suggest that future observa-
tions would very likely be fruitful in yielding an estimate
of the primordial helium abundance.

AGC 198691 is a small, high surface brightness system
that we classify as a blue compact dwarf galaxy. It is one
of the lowest luminosity members of the BCD class ever
discovered. Its observed color of B–V = 0.29 is indicative
of a galaxy dominated by a young stellar population. A
secure distance to this system is not currently available.
Our analysis of the available data appears to constrain
the distance to be within the range of 7–16 Mpc.
If
the distance is in the nearer portion of that range (7–11
Mpc) it is located in the sparsely populated Leo Spur.
If it has a distance in the farther portion of this range
(11–16 Mpc) then it is likely to be quite isolated, with no
neighbors within 1 Mpc. The determination of an accu-
rate distance for this object is a high priority. Regardless
of its distance, it is clear that AGC 198691 is extremely
gas rich.

The recent discoveries by the ALFALFA survey of two
new XMD systems with 12+log(O/H) less than 7.20
speak to the power of the H I selection method for search-
ing for metal poor systems. Both Leo P and AGC 198691
are extreme systems within the Local Supercluster that
remained unrecognized until their detection in the blind
H I survey carried out at Arecibo. Hundreds more AL-
FALFA detections remain to be explored.
