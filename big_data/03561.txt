Measurement-Induced Phase Transition in a Quantum Spin System

Department of Physics, University of Calcutta, 92 Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, Kolkata-700009, India

Shrabanti Dhar and Subinay Dasgupta

Suppose a quantum system starts to evolve under a Hamiltonian from some initial state. When
for the ﬁrst time, will an observable attain a preassigned value? To answer this question, one method
often adopted is to make instantaneous measurements periodically and note down the serial number
for which the desired result is obtained for the ﬁrst time. We apply this protocol to an interacting
spin system at zero temperature and show analytically that the response of this system shows a non-
analyticity as a function of the parameter of the Hamiltonian and the time interval of measurement.
In contrast to quantum phase transitions, this new type of phase transition is not a property of
the ground state and arises from the Hamiltonian dynamics and quantum mechanical nature of the
measurement. The speciﬁc system studied is transverse Ising chain and the measurement performed
is, whether the total transverse magnetic moment (per site) is not equal to 1. The results for some
other types of measurement is also discussed.

Introduction: Classical ﬁrst passage problem is
easy to formulate. We allow a system to undergo time
evolution starting from some initial state, and check
when a dynamical variable attains some preassigned
value X for the ﬁrst time. The corresponding quantum
mechanical version is diﬃcult to handle [1] because
measurement of time is associated with fundamental
issues and because continuous projective measurement
prevents time evolution of a quantum system (the
quantum Zeno eﬀect [2]). Following a prescription by
Misra and Sudarshan [3] one may perform [4] at interval
of time τ , instantaneous projective measurements which
answers the the question ‘Is the value of the observable in
question equal to X?’. We then identify the probability
that the answer is yes for the ﬁrst time at the n-th mea-
surement, as the probability that our measurement will
give X for the ﬁrst time at time nτ (n = 1, 2,··· ). This
gives an experimentally feasible protocol for measuring
the probability of ﬁrst occurrence within the framework
of the measurement hypothesis of quantum mechanics.
Such periodic measurements have also been proved to
be relevant for quantum communication[5]

Since a quantum measurement alters a system due to
its projective nature, it is interesting to investigate the
features of the changes brought into a system by mea-
surement itself. It has been demonstrated experimentally
that projective measurement can generate entanglement
between a pair of solid-state qubits [6] and between a pair
of superconducting qubits [7]. Theoretical investigations
[8–11] on various systems has also been performed.
In
this article, we show that when such a study is performed
on an interacting quantum Ising system, the response of
the system shows non-analytic behaviour as a function of
the parameter of the Hamiltonian and the time interval
of measurement. This is a new type of phase transition,
which does not arise from any singular behaviour of the
ground state, but is a result of the quantum mechanical
nature of the measurement and dynamics.

Speciﬁcally, we consider a periodic transverse Ising

chain of N Ising spins (s = ±1) at zero temperature
described by the Hamiltonian

H = − N(cid:88)

and perform on it a measurement (at interval of time τ )
that provides binary answer to the question

Is the magnetic moment (per site) Mz (cid:54)= 1?

(2)

i=1 sz
i

Here Γ is the strength of the transverse ﬁeld and Mz =
is the transverse magnetic moment per
site. One can calculate analytically the probability of
ﬁrst occurrence pn that the result will be yes for the ﬁrst
time at the n-th measurement, for an arbitrary value of τ
(not necessarily small) and ﬁnd that this quantity decays
exponentially with n with a decay constant α deﬁned by,

pn ∼ e−N τ 2(αn)

(3)

The central result of this work is that this decay con-
stant shows non-analytic behaviour as a function of the
ﬁeld strength Γ and time interval τ . Thus, for a given
τ > π/4, the decay constant α increases with Γ till a
critical value Γ0 and for Γ > Γ0, it decreases with Γ. A
similar behaviour is also observed in the variation of α
as a function of τ for a given value of Γ < 1. The dis-
continuity in the slopes (∂α/∂Γ)Γ0 and (∂α/∂τ )τ0 can
be calculated in closed form.
In view of the presence
of non-analyticity, we call this change in behaviour a
‘phase transition’, which indeed has no connection with
the order-disorder transition at Γ = 1 of the ground state
of the Hamiltonian H. We shall also discuss the cases of
other types of measurement and report that when the
measurement (2) is replaced by ‘Is Mz = 0? ’, according
to numerical studies with N ≤ 24 although pn still de-
cays more or less exponentially with n, there is no sign
of any non-analytic behaviour of the decay constant.

protocol followed here was developed in two earlier pa-
pers [4] for measuring experimentally the time of arrival
of a free quantum particle moving on a lattice under a
tight-binding Hamiltonian. This analytic treatment was
applicable for small but ﬁnite values of τ .

As mentioned above, projective measurement on a spin
system has been studied recently in various contexts [6–
11]. However, to our knowledge, long range order has not
yet been investigated.

Analytic expression for the probability of ﬁrst
occurrence: One can solve [12] the transverse Ising
Hamiltonian in Eq.
(1) for arbitrary N by transform-
ing it to a direct sum of commuting Hamiltonians Hk
given by

Hk = (−2i sin k)(cid:2)c∗

where k = (2(cid:96) + 1)π/N , with (cid:96) = 0, 1,··· , N
2 − 1 and c∗
k,
ck are Fermion creation and destruction operators.
In
the even-occupation space, the two eigenstates of Hk are
the ground state |GSk(cid:105) and the excited state |ESk(cid:105) with
respective eigenvalues −λk and λk given by,

(cid:112)

Γ2 + 1 + 2Γ cos k

tan θk =

Γ + cos k +

Mz = (1/N )(cid:80)

(8)
Here |11k(cid:105) (|00k(cid:105)) is a state that has a (no) fermion at
+k and −k. Let us denote the possible (even-occupation)
states in k-space as |b(cid:105) = |··· (−k, k)···(cid:105) where (−k, k)
corresponds to |11k(cid:105) or |00k(cid:105). There will be 2N/2 ≡ N(cid:48)
such states, which we denote by |b1(cid:105),|b2(cid:105),···|bN(cid:48)(cid:105) with
|b1(cid:105) as the state with no fermion at any k and |bN(cid:48)(cid:105) is
the state with a fermion at every ±k. Note that, since
kck − 1), we must
have (cid:104)bN(cid:48)|Mz|bN(cid:48)(cid:105) = 1.
The algorithm we follow is this : We start from an
initial conﬁguration of the system |ψ(0)(cid:105) at t = 0, let it
evolve under the Hamiltonian H of Eq. (1) for time τ ;
then we perform the measurement of (2); then again let
the system evolve for time τ and make the same mea-
surement, and so on. The ﬁrst occurrence probability at
the n-th measurement is given by,

where |ψ(nτ − )(cid:105) is the wave function just before the
n-th measurement and  is a small positive number. The
wave function after the n-th measurement will be

|ψ(nτ + )(cid:105) = |ψ(nτ − )(cid:105) − (cid:88)

Thus all the states with Mz (cid:54)= 1 are projected out and
only the state |bN(cid:48)(cid:105) (which is incidentally not an eigen-
state of the Hamiltonian) is retained. Let the amplitude
of the wave function after the n-th measurement be Cn,
so that

|ψ(nτ + )(cid:105) = Cn|bN(cid:48)(cid:105)

(11)

and the probability that the result is no for all the ﬁrst
n measurements is |Cn|2. Using Eqs.(6,7) we can express
|11k(cid:105) in terms of |GSk(cid:105) and |ESk(cid:105) and obtain the wave
function after time evolution as,

|ψ([n + 1]τ − )(cid:105) = Cn

The decay constant α shows non-analytic behaviour as
a function of Γ and τ at some ‘critical’ points (Γ0, τ0) due
to the logarithmic singularity in the expression (15) for
α. The critical point occurs when the argument of the

Two other measurements - analytic treatment:
It is interesting to consider two other types of measure-
ment for which one can calculate the decay constant an-
alytically. (i) Let us assume that the eﬀect of measure-
ment is to retain some single state |bj(cid:105) (without wor-
rying about the physical possibility of such measure-
ment). Since |11k(cid:105) after evolution over time τ becomes
(Ak|11k(cid:105)+Bk|00k(cid:105)) (as mentioned in Eq. (12)) and |00k(cid:105)
k|00k(cid:105) − Bk|11k(cid:105)), the
after such evolution becomes (A∗
ratio of probabilities is again given by Eq. (14) and the
decay constant α remains the same. (ii) If we replace the

measurement (2) by ‘Is Mz (cid:54)= ±1 ?’ then the state after
n-th measurement can be written as,
|ψ(nτ + )(cid:105) = Cn|b1(cid:105) + C(cid:48)

n|bN(cid:48)(cid:105)

n are the complex amplitudes.

press |00k(cid:105) and |11k(cid:105) in terms of |GSk(cid:105) and |ESk(cid:105) and
obtain the wave function after evolution over time τ , and
therefrom the wave function after n-th measurement. Fi-
nally, the ratio of ﬁrst occurrence probabilities is,

We have checked numerically that the product on the
right hand side is much less than unity in the region of
our interest. Hence, the behaviour of the decay constant
remains practically the same as that for measurement
(2).

Other measurements - numerical study: When

the measurement (2) is replaced by a more general one

Is Mz = Q ?

a superposition of several states (cid:80)

the states retained after each measurement is in general
j C(j)|bj(cid:105). It is dif-
ﬁcult to proceed analytically now, since each state |bj(cid:105)
after time evolution during the interval τ contribute to
all other states resulting in a complicated interference
phenomena. We have studied these cases numerically for
small chains (N ≤ 24) and obtained the following results
: (i) For the measurement (23), with Q = 0, the decay
constant α as a function of Γ and τ does not show any

FIG. 2:
(color online) Decay constant α as a function of

kink (Fig. 2) and is much smaller in magnitude than in
the previous case (Fig. 1). Thus, the numerical results
for small size preclude the existence of phase transition
in this case. (ii) As mentioned above, for (2) only the
state with Mz = 1 is retained after each measurement
and for (23) all the states with Mz (cid:54)= 0 are retained. We
have checked (numerically) that as we increase the num-
ber of states retained after each measurement, the peak
in the curve for α gradually decreases. (iii) To check the
reliability of our ﬁnite size numerical study, we have also
applied it to the measurement (2) (Fig. 3). The decay
does show a peak or kink at the critical values Γ0 and
τ0, but the position and height of the peak and kink vary
strongly and non-monotonically with N . Thus, the nu-
merical study reproduces the analytic result presented in
Fig. 1 and is reliable.
Eﬀect of Initial State: For the measurement of (2),
if we start at time t = 0 with a wave function |ψ(0)(cid:105),
then the amplitude just after the ﬁrst measurement will
be C1 = (cid:104)bN(cid:48)|ψ(0)(cid:105) according to Eqs. (10,11). However,
the ratio of amplitudes as given by Eq. (13) is indepen-
dent of |ψ(0)(cid:105). Thus, although the individual probabili-
ties, pn will depend on n, the ratio pn/p0 and hence the
decay constant α is independent of the initial state. All
the analytic results derived above for the measurement
of (2), are therefore true for all initial conditions.
For the measurement of (23) with Q = 0, the numeri-
cal results show a small amount of variation with initial
condition in an erratic way, but that issue is not con-
sequential, since the absence of phase transition in this
case is still maintained.

Discussions: We demonstrate analytically that peri-
odic projective measurement of transverse magnetic mo-
ment on a transverse Ising chain shows a new type of
phase transition.
If we ask the question “What is the
probability that at the n-th measurement the total trans-
verse magnetic moment Mz will be not equal to 1 for the

FIG. 3: (color online) Decay constant α computed numeri-
cally for the measurement (23), as a function of the applied
transverse ﬁeld Γ (top panel) and as a function of τ (bottom
panel) for ﬁnite system sizes. The top panel is for τ = 1.0
and the bottom panel for Γ = 0.5. The solid black curve is
the analytic result from Eq. (15). As in Fig. 2, the initial
state corresponds to the ground state and we have checked
that the results do not depend signiﬁcantly on this choice.

ﬁrst time?”, then the decay constant of this probability
is non-analytic as a function of transverse ﬁeld strength
and time-period of measurement. This non-analyticity
is not a result of some singularity in ground state be-
haviour, but constitutes of contributions from all excited
states and originates from the dynamics and the process
of measurement itself. There is no physical process (like
ordering or entanglement) or any symmetry breaking or
scaling that accompanies this transition. After each mea-
surement, a single state (in k space) is retained, and
during the time evolution thereafter, the wave function
spreads over other states. The non-analyticity associated
with this spreading is manifested as a phase transition.
We also report that according to numerical investigations
at small size, if we ask the question “What is the proba-
bility that at the n-th measurement the total transverse
magnetic moment Mz will be zero for the ﬁrst time?”,
then the decay constant of this probability does not show
any singular behaviour.

We have investigated in this work the behaviour of

eter of the transverse Ising Hamiltonian. Although the
phase transition we propose has no connection with the
order-disorder phase transition, it would certainly be of
interest to investigate the response of the system to a
measurement related to the order parameter, namely,
the longitudinal magnetisation. However, we could not
include this study here, since the analytic calculation
of longitudinal magnetisation is diﬃcult to perform and
meaningful results are obtained only from analytic stud-
ies. Work in this direction is in progress.

Experimental study of cold atoms on optical lattices
may provide an avenue for exploring such phenomena. A
search for similar phase transitions for measurement of
other quantities will also be of interest for theoreticians.
