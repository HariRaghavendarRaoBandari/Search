HLL Riemann Solvers and Alfven Waves in Black Hole

Magnetospheres

ABSTRACT

In the magnetosphere of a rotating black hole, an inner Alfven critical surface
(IACS) must be crossed by inﬂowing plasma. Inside the IACS, Alfven waves are
inward directed toward the black hole. The majority of the proper volume of
the active region of spacetime (the ergosphere) is inside of the IACS. The charge
and the totally transverse momentum ﬂux (the momentum ﬂux transverse to
both the wave normal and the unperturbed magnetic ﬁeld) are both determined
exclusively by the Alfven polarization. However, numerical simulations of black
hole magnetospheres are often based on 1-D HLL Riemann solvers that read-
ily dissipate Alfven waves. Elements of the dissipated wave emerge in adjacent
cells regardless of the IACS, there is no mechanism to prevent Alfvenic informa-
tion from crossing outward. Thus, it is unclear how simulated magnetospheres
attain the substantial Goldreich-Julian charge density associated with the ro-
tating magnetic ﬁeld. The HLL Riemann solver is also notorious for producing
large recurring transients (i.e., it prevents a “well-balanced” numerical scheme),
potentially masking the causal physical transients required to achieve a steady
state. To overcome these shortcomings, we have formulated a one-dimensional
Riemann solver, called HLLI, which incorporates the Alfven discontinuity and
the contact discontinuity. We have also formulated a multidimensional Riemann
solver, called MuSIC, that enables low dissipation propagation of Alfven waves in
multiple dimensions. Such Riemann solvers also enable simulations that are well-
balanced at least up to second order. The importance of higher order schemes in
lowering the numerical dissipation of Alfven waves is also catalogued.

Introduction

In this century, there has been great progress in 3-D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations of black hole magnetospheres (De Villiers et al. 2003; Komissarov 2004b, 2005;
Hawley and Krolik 2006; Fragile et al 2007; McKinney and Blandford 2009; McKinney et al.
2012). To varying degrees, each of these simulations require knowledge of the 1-D charac-
teristics of the MHD system in order to time evolve the magnetosphere. Speciﬁcally, the
polarization properties of the waves determine the changes in the ﬁelds that can be propa-
gated at the appropriate speed along a particular characteristic direction. In single ﬂuid ideal
MHD there are three plasma modes in the system, the fast mode, the Alfven (or intermedi-
ate) mode and the slow mode. Black hole magnetospheres have the property that all plasma
must pass progressively through the slow, Alfven and fast critical surfaces before reaching
the event horizon (Punsly 2008). As each critical surface is crossed, the unique information
associated with each wave mode is unable to be communicated upstream to an outgoing wind
or jet. The event horizon wind system has no boundary conditions at its terminus, there
are asymptotic inﬁnities both at the event horizon and at large radial coordinate (Punsly
2008). There are only lateral boundary conditions imposed by accreting gas. Thus, the wind
system itself and the lateral boundary conditions determine 3-D single ﬂuid perfect MHD
wind solutions. Furthermore, due to the paired wind nature of the event horizon wind sys-
tem (an ingoing accretion inner wind and the outgoing outer wind or jet), plasma is always
drained oﬀ of the ﬁeld lines and auxiliary physics (mass ﬂoors) must be injected by hand in
order to keep numerical simulations from crashing at low density. Mass ﬂoors are a source of
MHD waves and are generally chosen to enhance dissipation. Consequently, there are many
unique aspects to the application of MHD that can inﬂuence the ﬁnal steady state of the
wind system. Describing the evolution of the event horizon magnetosphere with single ﬂuid
MHD is wrought with non trivial subtleties.

These subtleties relate to the numerical determination of the ﬁeld line angular velocity
as viewed from asymptotic inﬁnity, ΩF . This is of primary interest since the Poynting
ﬂux of the wind scales as Ω2
F (Punsly 2008). First, contrary to previous claims of early
simulations, newer simulations indicate that ΩF can be altered signiﬁcantly by the auxiliary
method of injecting plasma (McKinney et al. 2012; Beskin and Zheltoukhov, 2013). These
results were based on the Harten, Lax and Van Leer (HLL) Riemann solvers (Harten et al.
1983). The HLL Riemann solver is implemented in many simulations of 3-D MHD black hole
magnetospheres (Etienne et al. 2015; Gammie et al 2003; McKinney and Blandford 2009;
McKinney et al. 2012). An issue related to the determination of ΩF is the 2-wave nature of
the HLL solver. The HLL solver is based on the outgoing and ingoing fast discontinuities.
In particular, we consider the unique role of the oblique Alfven wave in the context of the
Riemann solver. It is shown in the Appendix that a unique component of the momentum

– 3 –

ﬂux is propagated along the Alfven characteristics and this momentum ﬂux is a component
of the MHD equations written in conservative form. It is also the only isolated discontinuity
that propagates a physical charge. In Section 3, it is shown that black hole magnetospheres
that support an outgoing relativistic jet, rotate and have a Goldreich-Julian charge density.
In addition, it is shown that the Alfven critical surface for the inﬂow (IACS) is quite far from
the event horizon. For proper evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld rotation rate and the induced
charge density, one must be able to simulate the role of Alfven waves with high ﬁdelity both
globally and inside of the IACS. Thusly motivated, we discuss how to accurately characterize
the Alfven wave numerically in the rareﬁed environment of black hole magnetosphere.

An accurate depiction of the time evolution of a black hole magnetosphere and the
global considerations germane to the IACS are intimately related to minimizing the numerical
dissipation of Alfven waves. At extraordinarily high resolutions, any well-designed code will
of course minimize this dissipation. However, the present generation of simulations have all
been done with low or modest resolutions. Furthermore, they have mostly used the HLL
Riemann solver which, we argue, applies a maximal, and deleterious, dissipation to Alfven
waves. To appreciate this point, realize that the HLL Riemann solver is based on a wave
model that has just two extremal waves. These two extremal waves determine the ends of
the Riemann fan in one-dimension. The speed of these extremal waves is usually set to the
extremal signal speeds in the physical problem. For a relativistic MHD (RMHD) simulation
of highly magnetized event horizon magnetospheres, these extremal signal speeds are usually
set to approximately the speed of light propagating in either direction at a zone interface
where the Riemann solver is applied. The HLL Riemann solver does not incorporate any
further sub-structure associated with intermediate waves. Consequently, the HLL Riemann
solver maximizes the dissipation of Alfven waves even near the IACS. This is the very location
where the dissipation of these waves has to be minimized. Introducing the intermediate waves
in the Riemann fan reduces the dissipation, but that eﬀect is not incorporated in the HLL
Riemann solver.

There is another issue that increases the dissipation of Alfven waves, in more than one
dimension. Riemann solvers applied to black hole magnetospheres have been treated as
1-D in each direction. However, a true multi-dimensional Riemann solver has a strongly
interacting region in which the numerical ﬂuxes in orthogonal directions become intertwined
(Balsara 2012). The result has far less dissipation (as we show for RMHD in Section 6).
The increase in computational complexity is handily oﬀset by larger timesteps and greater
code robustness. The accuracy of the numerical depiction of the role of the Alfven waves
near a black hole during jet production is facilitated by a true multidimensional scheme that
incorporates the strongly interacting region.

– 4 –

Our ultimate goal is to understand the time evolution of the black hole magnetosphere.
This is subtle because one must try to understand in each time step how the mass ﬂoor is
aﬀecting the time evolution. Thus, the transient structure is essential to monitor in order
to see how transients associated with plasma injection are altering the time evolution of the
system. This requires an inherently very stable numerical scheme (“well-balanced”, which
we describe below).
In particular, an unexpected ﬁnding of Krolik et al (2005) was that
the event horizon magnetospheres in numerical simulations are very unsteady and appear
to be more like a cauldron of strong MHD waves rather than a force-free structure, “For
example, although the funnel region is magnetically-dominated, it is not in general in a state
of force-free equilibrium. Indeed, the very large ﬂuctuations that continually occur in the
outﬂow show that it is never in any state of equilibrium, force-free or otherwise.” This also
appears to be the case in the simulations of McKinney et al. (2012) based on the supporting
online movies. This suggests that wind formation in event horizon magnetospheres might
be subject to large numerically induced transients which would mask the kinds of eﬀects
that we are looking for. Alternatively, if these large transients are integral to jet formation
it indicates a dynamic in which strong waves from the lateral boundaries created by the
accretion ﬂow scatter oﬀ the event horizon magnetosphere producing strong gusts of energy
in a jetted outﬂow.

It is important to separate these potential physical eﬀects from numerical eﬀects. How-
ever, schemes that are based on higher order Godunov methods, especially those that are
based on the HLL Riemann solver, are notorious for not achieving steady state even when
the physical problem admits such a steady state! This was ﬁrst observed higher when or-
der Godunov schemes with Riemann solvers were ﬁrst applied to metreological simulations
(which simulate wind ﬂow in the earth’s atmosphere) or to the shallow water equations
(which simulate lake and ocean circulation); (Par´es 2006). Unless the numerical scheme
has a special property called well-balancing, it usually does not ﬁnd a stationary state even
when one exists. Instead, the simulation generates ”numerical storms” – high velocity ﬂows
that are entirely a numerical artefact. The issue of well-balancing has recently become more
compelling within the context of astrophysical ﬂows with the work of Kappeli and Mishra
(2014, 2016). Within the context of Type IIb supernova simulations, it has been found that
the proto-neutron stars refuse to reach steady state if the scheme is not well-balanced, i.e.,
the numerical method has to be specially engineered to that it can ﬁnd a steady-state proto-
neutron star solution if one exists. Kappeli and Mishra have also explored time-dependent
simulations that are not in steady state. Their very interesting result is that even for simu-
lations that have no reason to be in steady state, the inclusion of well-balancing provides a
substantial improvement in the accuracy of the simulation. This result has bearing on the
black hole magnetospheres problem because it suggests that even when the simulations are

– 5 –

far from steady state they might indeed be helped by well-balancing.

In order to verify that one has a well-balanced scheme, one has to know what the steady
states of the system are and make sure that the simulated system is driven towards that
steady state. This does not mean that every system must reach a steady state; it only
means that when such a steady state exists, the numerical code is equipped to ﬁnd it. For a
scheme to be truly well-balanced, it needs to have two attributes. First, the reconstruction
procedure has to be modiﬁed so that any potential steady state solution is subtracted oﬀ
from the reconstructed solution. Second, the scheme must use a Riemann solver that can
capture intermediate waves – speciﬁcally the contact discontinuity in classical Euler ﬂow.
We admit, that in certain circumstances it may not be possible to identify the steady state
solution that has to be subtracted oﬀ. In such situations, the numerical scheme should at
least be well-balanced up to second order.
In practical terms, this means that a modest
resolution simulation will not ﬁnd the steady state solution to machine accuracy. However,
it will nevertheless ﬁnd the steady state solution with accuracies that are proportional to
the size of the mesh squared. Being well-balanced up to second order is a weaker notion
of well-balancing compared to being truly well-balanced. In order for a scheme to be well-
balanced up to second order, it is imperative that the Riemann solver should at least capture
stationary contact discontinuities in a self-gravitating situation involving Euler ﬂow. The
discussion in this paragraph has made it clear that in order to disentangle a ﬂow that is
chaotic because of the physics of the situation from a ﬂow that is chaotic because of simple
numerical eﬀects, one must pay attention to the form of the Riemann solver.

In summary, for the purposes of exploring the time evolution of event horizon magne-
tospheres, we require a well-balanced scheme to second order that will eliminate recurrent
large transients. This is facilitated by preserving the Alfven wave as discussed above, but
also requires that the inclusion of the contact discontinuity in the Riemann fan. Further-
more, the absence of a contact discontinuity in the HLL Riemann solver means that there
is nothing to regulate the huge density gradient between accretion ﬂow and the evacu-
ated funnel of the event horizon magnetosphere. Thus, plasma ﬂows into the funnel by
numerical diﬀusion. This is far from ideal if we want to explore the role of mass in-
jection on the ﬁnal solutions. To cure this situation, one needs a Riemann solver that
at least minimizes the dissipation at contact discontinuities.

tion on numerical schemes and Riemann solvers of relevance to astrophysics, please visit

Designing low-dissipation Riemann solvers for RMHD is a challenging enterprise. An ex-
act RMHD Riemann solver exists, Giacomazzo & Rezzolla (2006); Giacomazzo and Rezzolla
(2007), but it is not practicable for use in numerical codes. HLLC Riemann solvers for RMHD

– 6 –

exist (Mignone & Bodo 2006; Honkkila & Janhunen 2007; Kim & Balsara 2014). They en-
able a stationary contact discontinuity to be captured on a mesh. However, they dissi-
pate stationary Alfven waves just like an HLL Riemann solver. HLLD Riemann solvers for
RMHD, (Mignone, Ugliano and Bodo(2009), do exist, which enable stationary contact dis-
continuities as well as stationary Alfvenic discontinuities to be captured on a computational
mesh. Unfortunately, the method is iterative, which makes it computationally very expen-
sive. Furthermore, when an iteration fails to converge, the method becomes brittle. With
the emergence of the HLLI Riemann solver, Dumbser and Balsara (2016), it has become
possible to capture stationary contact discontinuities as well as stationary Alfvenic disconti-
nuities using a Riemann solver that is non-iterative and computationally inexpensive. The
ﬁrst goal of this paper is to document this capability in the astrophysical literature.

RMHD simulations also have to maintain the divergence-free structure of the magnetic
ﬁeld. This necessitates the use of a Yee-type mesh where the magnetic ﬁeld components are
speciﬁed at the faces of the mesh and the electric ﬁelds are to be evaluated at the edges
of the mesh. It was claimed by Gardiner & Stone (2005, 2008); Beckwith & Stone (2011);
White & Stone (2015) that stabilizing the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld requires that one
should always double the dissipation in the electric ﬁeld at every timestep. Unfortunately,
that approach has been used in the RMHD literature with the result that the already ex-
cessive dissipation of the HLL Riemann solver is increased even further in simulations. Such
explorations ignore recent advances in multidimensional Riemann solver technology (Balsara
2010, 2012, 2014, 2015; Balsara et al. 2014; Balsara & Dumbser 2015; Balsara et al. 2016a).
In a recent paper, Balsara & Kim (2016), showed that an exact analogue of the HLLI Rie-
mann solver in multidimensions can be designed for RMHD. Their work is based on the
original paper by Balsara et al. (2016b). Such multidimensional Riemann solvers go under
the name of MuSIC Riemann solvers. Here the MuSIC acronym stands for Multidimen-
sional, Self-similar strongly-Interacting riemann solver that is based on Consistency with the
conservation law. By introducing substructure associated with the multidimensional propa-
gation of Alfven waves, the MuSIC Riemann solver reduces the dissipation of Alfven waves
that propagate at any angle with respect to the mesh. The second goal of this paper is to
catalogue the advantages of the MuSIC Riemann solver in reducing the dissipation involved
in the multidimensional propagation of Alfven waves in RMHD.

In this article, we claim that modern 5-wave Riemann solvers can now be implemented
that can allow a systematic assessment of the issues related to determination of ΩF . This
would require the formulation and simulation of simple magnetospheres, lateral boundary
conditions and plasma injection mechanisms. Proper time evolution of the 3-D magneto-
sphere requires two main aspects of the solver, low dissipation and well balancing. We
have motivated both these issues in the previous paragraphs. We demonstrate that the new

– 7 –

Riemann solvers described here are capable of delivering on these goals in the following.

Riemann solvers oﬀer one way of reducing numerical dissipation and Riemann solvers
that preserve essential features of the ﬂow are certainly central to many aspects of jet simu-
lation. Recent advances in higher order schemes has made it possible to go beyond the tra-
ditional second order Godunov scheme that is commonplace in computational astrophysics.
The third goal of this paper is to show that higher order schemes for RMHD do exist,
Balsara & Kim (2016); Del Zanna et al. (2007); Zanotti & Dumbser (2016), which make it
possible to go beyond second order of accuracy. We show that the combination of higher
order schemes and appropriate Riemann solvers can go a long way towards enabling almost
dissipation-free propagation of Alfven waves.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the various coordinate systems
that are required for this discussion. Section 3 and the Appendix derive the fundamental role
of the Alfven waves in establishing ΩF and deﬁnes the IACS. In Section 4, it is shown that
the HLL solver strongly dissipates Alfven and contact discontinuities near and the IACS.
Ultimately, this dissipation needs to be reduced by skilful application of high quality nu-
merics. Even so, it is good to have some theoretical backing. For this reason, in Section 4,
we compute the increased dissipation in numerical ﬂux of the Alfven wave in an individual
time step of an HLL solver inside the IACS relative to the HLLI 5-wave solver (ingoing
and outgoing fast discontinuities, ingoing and outgoing Alfven waves and the contact dis-
continuity). It is shown that the HLLI Riemann solver provides the theoretical minimum
dissipation that is consistent with a stable numerical scheme. In section 5, we demonstrate
by explicit examples that the HLLI RMHD Riemann solver preserves the Alfven wave with
high accuracy and respects the contact discontinuity. In Section 6, we incorporate the im-
portant aspects of multi-dimensionality with the MuSIC RMHD Riemann solver. This is
truly a multi-dimensional scheme and we demonstrate that its ability to resolve the strongly
interacting region substantially reduces Alfvenic dissipation compared to higher dimensional
schemes that utilize 1-D Riemann solvers in each direction. In our ﬁnal discussion section, we
describe how a numerical scheme that utilizes the MuSIC Riemann solver would be suitable
for specialized simulations that would shed light on the causal physics of the time evolution
of event horizon magnetospheres and help deﬁne the full panoply of physically allowed and
disallowed solutions.

2. Reference Frames

There are four important reference frames to consider in order to understand the role
of the Alfven wave in a Riemann problem formulated in the Kerr spacetime of a rotating

– 8 –

black hole. Firstly, consider the proper frame of the single ﬂuid MHD plasma, which will be
designated as the unprimed frame. There is no electric ﬁeld and no velocity motion in this
rest frame equilibrium state,

Bo ≡ Bo(cos θe1 + sin θe2) , Eo = 0 , vo = 0 .

(1)

The time axis in this local coordinate system is the bulk four velocity of the plamsa, uν. An
MHD step wave travels through a homogeneous, uniformly magnetized state with a velocity,
V along e1 and the four velocity of the wave is designated by K µ. In the proper equilibrium
frame of the plasma

K µ = γ0(1, V, 0, 0) , γo =

.

p1 − (V /c)2

The interest here is to distinguish the Alfven wave from other wave phenomena. Thus,
without loss of generality, simple MHD waves are considered since the Alfven wave is a
simple wave. The nonlinear aspects of the compressive slow and fast wave will not aﬀect the
linear Alfven mode. Thus, the discussion involves isolated MHD discontinuities.

The frame of reference that is at rest with respect to the wave front is the primed frame.

In the moving frame, Equation (2) transforms to

B

′

o ≡ Bo(cos θe1 + γo sin θe2) , Eo

′

= γo(V /c)Boe3 , vo = −V e1 ,

(3)

This frame simpliﬁes the study of the jump conditions across MHD discontinuities that is
found in the Appendix.

The third frame is the coordinate frame associated with the computational mesh. It
will be designated with double primes in general. Finally, calculations are performed in the
globally deﬁned Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. Boyer Lindquist coordinates are stationary
with respect to asymptotic inﬁnity. The metric is deﬁned by the black hole mass, M, and
the angular momentum per unit mass, a. In these coordinates, the metric of the spacetime
of a rotating black hole, ˜gµν, is given by the line element

– 9 –

There are two event horizons given by the roots of the equation ∆ = 0. The outer

horizon at rH is of physical interest, rH = M + √M 2 − a2. The stationary limit surface,
rs = M + √M 2 − a2 cos2 θ. This change happens when ˜gtt switches sign. The region in

at r = rs occurs when ∂/∂t changes from a timelike vector ﬁeld to a spacelike vector ﬁeld,

which ˜gtt > 0 is the ergosphere. The outer boundary of the ergosphere is the stationary limit
surface.

3. Global Implications of Alfvenic Propagation in a Magnetosphere

The winds in the black hole magnetosphere are paired. The outgoing mass ﬂux at
large distances is the usual wind. However, due to strong gravity, the ﬂow must be ingoing
near the black hole. Thus, there exists a paired ingoing/outgoing wind system in an event
horizon magnetosphere. Due to mass conservation, ideal single ﬂuid MHD must breakdown
somewhere in the ﬂow as mass drains oﬀ of the ﬁeld lines toward the outgoing and ingoing
asymptotic inﬁnities.

Consider an orthonormal frame at a ﬁxed poloidal coordinate, eµ, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 . Let
e3 be the azimuthal direction. Then according to the ideal MHD condition equation (A2),
there is a corotating frame at constant poloidal coordinate in which the poloidal electric ﬁeld
vanishes in a time stationary spacetime, i.e,

E2 = −βφ

F B1 ,

(5)

where B1 is the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld. When the three-velocity of ﬁeld rotation becomes
light-like, βφ
F = ±1, one has a light cylinder or speed of light surface in all physical frames.
Note that the concept of a light cylinder can be extended to non time stationary, non-
axisymmetric magnetospheres (Punsly 2008). Black hole magnetospheres have two light
cylinders, one far from the black hole like a pulsar (outer light surface) and one near the
black hole (inner light surface) that arises from the dragging of inertial frames in the black
hole geometry described by the Kerr metric. The Alfven speed (intermediate wave speed)
in an MHD wind is expressed in Punsly (2008) as

I = (1 − [βφ
U 2

F ]2)U 2

A .

(6)

UI goes to zero at the light cylinders according to Equation (6). At the inner light cylinder,
the bulk velocity of all ingoing accreting winds will exceed UI. Thus, no outgoing Alfven
wave can escape. The set of points where the bulk ﬂow poloidal velocity U 2
I is known
as the inner Alfven critical surface (IACS). For the physically relevant case of magnetically
dominated accretion, this surface is very close to the inner light cylinder. Since the Alfven

wave is the only wave that can transport a physical charge (see the Appendix), the IACS
is also a charge horizon, no physical charge can ﬂow outward through the charge horizon
(Komissarov 2004a; Punsly 2004).

The ﬁeld line rotation rate is typically described by the angular velocity as measured in
the stationary frames at asymptotic inﬁnity, ΩF . This is attained from βφ
F by a coordinate
transformation (Punsly 2008). For outgoing wind solutions that can extract black hole spin
energy, this is bounded from above by the angular velocity of the event horizon, ΩH,

0 < ΩF < ΩH .

(7)

The magnetosphere of the event horizon will be plasma starved as the ingoing and outgoing
winds separate, plasma is lost to the outgoing wind and to accretion onto the black hole. How
and if this plasma is replenished is a subject of speculation (Blandford and Znajek 1977).
Being charge starved, one expects a magnetically dominated magnetosphere, U 2
A >> 1.
Thus, by Equation (6), U 2
I until the just before the inner light cylinder is reached.
The IACS is just outside the inner light surface. Realistic accretion scenarios in modern
numerical work with accretion disks yields

P < U 2

0.2ΩH < ΩF < 0.4ΩH .

(8)

An example from McKinney et al. (2012) is plotted in Figure 1. In Figure 2, the approxima-
tion of near zero mass density is used to estimate the location of the IACS as the inner light
surface. The plot is made for various values of ΩF . If ΩF = ΩH , the IACS is near the event
horizon. If ΩF = 0, the IACS is near the stationary limit surface, inside of which one has the
ergosphere where all particles rotate in the forward direction relative to stationary frames at
asymptotic inﬁnity. In the seminal work, ΩF = 0.5ΩH (Blandford and Znajek 1977). So, this
is plotted as well, for historical reasons. This plot does not plot the coordinate displacement
from the event horizon, but plots the physically relevant quantity, the proper distance from
the event horizon; D. The quantity, D, gives a tracer of the amount of ergosphere that is
inside of the IACS. The proper distance is computed from the Boyer-Lindquist metric, ˜gµν,
given by Equation (4)

D(r = R) = Z R

rH p˜grrdr ,

(9)

where rH is the radial coordinate of the event horizon. The inner light surface is the solution
of the constraint ΩF = Ωminimum, where Ωminimum is the minimum allowed angular velocity
as viewed from asymptotic inﬁnity that is permitted by the dragging of inertial frames.
It becomes positive inside of the stationary limit, the ergosphere. The condition, ΩF =
Ωminimum, is equivalent to the light cylinder condition βφ
F = −1. The condition, ΩF =

– 13 –

Ωminimum, provides an equation for r and θ on the inner speed of light surface in Boyer-
Lindquist coordinates (Punsly 2008),

ΩF = −c˜gφt/˜gφφ − c∆1/2 sin θ/˜gφφ .

(10)

The results are plotted in Figure 2 for various values of ΩF . For graphical representation
purposes, the event horizon is placed at D = rH. In the range of interest for causal consid-
erations of current numerical work, 0.2ΩH < ΩF < 0.4ΩH, most of the ergosphere is inside
of the IACS.

The implication of Figure 2 is that a huge region of the ergosphere is out of Alfven wave
contact with the outgoing wind. The ergopshere is the region of spacetime that enforces
rotation in the same sense as the black hole for all particles and waves. Thus, it is the region
that must be primarily responsible for creating large values of ﬁeld line rotation, ΩF ∼ ΩH .
From Equation (5) and Equation (A2), a rotating magnetosphere means that there is a an
electric ﬁeld in a coordinate system that is time stationary at asymptotic inﬁnity. Then by
Gauss’ Law there is a charge density, the Goldreich Julian charge density. This presents a
conundrum. If a large ΩF is created as a consequence of the rapid rotation of ergospheric
plasma and most of this rapidly rotating plasma is inside the IACS, the charge horizon, how
is the Goldreich Julian charge density that is associated with ΩF causally established? This
is still not understood.

This causality issue was noted more than a decade ago by Komissarov (2004a) “This is
particularly easy to see in the limit of force-free electrodynamics. In this approximation the
electric charge and the electric current density can only be changed by hyperbolic waves.
The fast waves cannot do this as they have identical properties to linearly polarized waves
of vacuum electrodynamics. The only other option is the Alfven waves.” However, this
conundrum was never actually resolved.
It was quickly dismissed based on a plot of the
Alfven critical surface for the case ΩF = 0.7ΩH which does not appear to be relevant to
numerical simulations of event horizon magnetospheres. But, as can be seen from Figure
2, this would give the illusion that the IACS surface is close to the event horizon. The
issue was claimed to be resolved in Komissarov (2004a) by the statement: “What we need
to verify is that the ergosphere is causally connected with the outgoing wind. In fact, as
shown in Appendix A1, the inner Alfven surface is always located inside the ergosphere, and
our numerical simulations are fully consistent with this result (see Figs 4 and A1).” This
appears to be an unjustiﬁed conclusion in general since the location of the IACS excludes
most of the ergospheric plasma for the values of ΩF in Equation (8) that are found in 3-
D accretion ﬂow problems. The idea is true that the portion of the ergosphere that is in
Alfven wave communication with the outgoing wind determines ΩF , but the issue addressed
here is that information associated with outgoing Alfvenic waves (in the proper frame of

– 14 –

the plasma) created inside the IACS should not be communicated outward in our Riemann
solvers, otherwise the determination of ΩF may not result from a physical process.

4. Comparison and Contrast of HLL and HLLI Riemann Solvers

In this section, we illustrate the mathematical implications of the IACS in conservative
upwind schemes that utilize HLL Riemann solvers. For simplicity and without loss of gen-
erality, consider a one-dimensional grid. The conservation equation that must be solved at
each time step can be formally written as

∂U
∂x0” +

∂F
∂x1” = 0 ,

(11)

For a ﬁne enough mesh and a well behaved coordinate system, the covariant derivatives can
be replaced with ordinary derivatives. In an integral (weak solution) solution of the Riemann
problem, the higher order corrections due to connection coeﬃcients will be small (bilinear)
corrections compared to the integral of the derivative terms which are linear in the space-time
mesh size. Thus, the error induced by these terms can be made arbitrarily small on a ﬁne
enough mesh compared to the diﬀerential terms and may, therefore, be ignored for illustrative
purposes. However, in practice the mesh might be coarse enough that the connection terms
are important to the Riemann problem and represent source terms in the conservation law
(Del Zanna et al. 2007). The present paper does not focus on a consideration of stiﬀ source
terms.

Consider the nature of the ﬂow at the IACS. We are especially interested in the prop-
agation of diﬀerent RMHD wave families relative to the IACS which, in principle, could
be stationary relative to the computational mesh. The space-time diagram is indicated in
Figure 3. The ﬂow is super-Alfvenic inward (to the left). The ﬂow is not super-fast inward.
This ﬁgure is a spacetime diagram of the MHD characteristics at an interface between cells
inside of the IACS. The 5-wave Riemann fan is illustrated (the slow waves are ignored with-
out loss of generality) in order to show the diﬀerence in the resolved ﬂux at the interface
between an HLL calculation and an ideal 5-wave solution of the Riemann problem. The
spacetime in Figure 3 is split into various zones. The zone boundaries are the world lines
in the spacetime diagram that are associated with the isolated discontinuities. The resolved
ﬂux is the numerical ﬂux in the zone that straddles the time axis. Inside of the IACS, the
resolved ﬂux is the numerical ﬂux in the zone bounded on the left by Alfven wave that is
outgoing in the proper frame (but ingoing on the computational mesh) and on the right by
the outgoing fast wave. Physically, since the outgoing Alfven wave overlies the time axis
in Figure 3, we are interested in capturing the stationary Alfvenic surface with maximum

precision and the least possible numerical diﬀusion.

Consider a one-dimensional Riemann problem with left and right states UL and UR that
are separated by a Riemann fan with extremal speeds that span [SL, SR]. Let the ﬂuxes that
correspond to the left and right states be given by FL and FR. The numerical ﬂux from
practically any one-dimensional Riemann solver can be formally written as

F∗ =

1
2

(FL + FR) −

1
2

Θ(UR − UL) .

(12)

The ﬁrst term, which is the average of the left and right ﬂuxes in the above expression,
simply provides a centered, non-dissipative ﬂux. The second term in the above expression is
known as the dissipation term. The matrix, Θ, in the second term is the viscosity matrix, it
regulates the dissipation of the Riemann solver. Further details on the ensuing mathematics
can be found in Dumbser and Balsara (2016), Appendix B. Here we provide just enough
results to show the diﬀerence between the dissipation from the HLL Riemann solver and the
HLLI Riemann solver.

The viscosity matrix is usually expressed in terms of the right and left eigenvectors of
the Roe matrix. Denoting the Roe matrix by A(UL, UR), we will refer to its left and right
eigenvectors by L and R. The eigenvalues of the Roe matrix will be denoted by a diagonal
matrix, Λ. The viscosity matrix for the HLLI Riemann solver can be written as

Θ = RΣL

Here I is the identity matrix and (for our purposes) δ is a special diagonal matrix that is
introduced into the HLLI Riemann solver to judiciously reduce dissipation. Notice, therefore,
that is also a diagonal matrix. Please observe from the previous equation that the viscosity
matrix introduces dissipation on a wave-by-wave basis, i.e. if the diagonal term corresponding
to a particular wave becomes zero, the dissipation that is provided to that wave will also
become zero. If we choose the diagonal terms in δ just right, we can minimize the dissipation
and even guarantee that the dissipation of standing Alfven waves is exactly zero. This is
exactly what has been done in Dumbser and Balsara (2016). Those authors provide precise
expressions for the diagonal matrix, δ, which ensure that stationary waves (whether they are
Alfven waves or the entropy wave) have zero dissipation. For the sake of completeness, we
catalogue their speciﬁcation of the ith term of the diagonal matrix, δ, as

δi = 1 −

min(λi, 0)

SL

−

max(λi, 0)

SR

.

(15)

– 17 –

Here λi is the ith eigenvalue of the Roe matrix corresponding to the wave that we are
interested in. We see that the dissipation is ﬁnely tuned so that a moving Alfven wave gets
just the minimum amount of dissipation that it needs, consistent with numerical stability.
For example, a wave that propagates slowly relative to the computational mesh is given
smaller dissipation compared to a wave that is propagating at high speed on the mesh. This
decision to regulate the dissipation according to the wave speed is also what is demanded by
numerical stability.

The viscosity matrix for the HLL Riemann solver is retrieved by setting δ = 0. In that
case, a standing Alfven wave has non-zero dissipation which means that the Alfven waves
at the IACS surface will dissipate. Furthermore, with δ = 0, it is easy to see that the HLL
Riemann solver gives all waves a non-zero dissipation regardless of their wave speed. To see
this, let λi be a speciﬁc eigenvalue. Then the ith term for the diagonal matrix, Σ can be
written as .

Σi =

SR(λi − SL) − SL(SR − λi)

SR − SL

.

(16)

For the sub-sonic case shown in Figure 3 we have SL < 0 < SR. We see that Σi > 0 for
all intermediate eigenvalues, λi, with SL < λi < SR. Consequently all intermediate waves,
like Alfven waves or contact discontinuities, will always be dissipated by the HLL Riemann
solver.

In this section, we have only given a ﬂavor of the dissipation characteristics of the HLLI
Riemann solver and how it oﬀers a substantial improvement over the HLL Riemann solver.
The reader who is interested in details should please read Dumbser and Balsara (2016).

5. One Dimensional Riemann Solvers in RMHD

The Introduction has shown that it is very desirable to have Riemann solvers that
can capture stationary, isolated contact discontinuities as well as stationary, isolated Alfven
waves. Indeed the ﬁrst of the one-dimensional Riemann solvers for RMHD by Komissarov
(1999) and Balsara (2001) were Roe-type Riemann solvers. Because such Riemann solvers re-
tain the entire set of eigenvectors for the RMHD system, they can indeed capture stationary,
isolated contact discontinuities as well as stationary, isolated Alfven waves on a mesh. There
has been a recent eﬀort by Ant´on et al. (2010) to revive the use of Roe-type Riemann solvers
in RMHD simulations, but the eﬀort has met with limited success owing to the exorbitant
computational cost of such Riemann solvers, especially for RMHD. The Roe-type Riemann
solvers also have an inherent deﬁciency. This has to do with their loss of positivity of density
and pressure in certain circumstances (Einfeldt 1988; Einfeldt et al. 1991). It is easy to ﬁnd

– 18 –

mentions in the early literature on RMHD, Komissarov (1999, 2004b, 2005), showing that
the early RMHD simulation codes struggled with positivity issues and, therefore, reverted
to the use of the HLL Riemann solver. This issue is relevant to the extremely low density
environment of event horizon magnetospheres.

HLLD Riemann solvers.

(Mignone, Ugliano and Bodo(2009), also enable a code to
capture stationary, isolated contact discontinuities as well as stationary, isolated Alfven
waves. But they have their own set of attendant problems, as discussed in the Intro-
duction. HLLC Riemann solvers, Mignone & Bodo (2006); Honkkila & Janhunen (2007);
Kim & Balsara (2014), represent a compromise position where they enable a code to capture
stationary, isolated contact discontinuities, but not Alfven waves. The HLLI Riemann solver
of Dumbser and Balsara (2016) is built on top of an HLL Riemann solver, so it inherits all
the beneﬁcial positivity properties of the HLL Riemann solver. However, it introduces sub-
structure in the Riemann fan. Typically, that substructure includes the contribution from
eigenvectors of the contact discontinuity and eigenvectors associated with Alfven waves. The
eigenvectors for the fast and slow magnetosonic waves are very expensive to evaluate com-
putationally, and their evaluation is avoided in the HLLI Riemann solver. As a result, the
HLLI Riemann solver enables a code to capture stationary, isolated contact discontinuities
as well as stationary, isolated Alfven waves at a very low computational cost. Unlike HLLC
and HLLD, the HLLI Riemann solver does not require an iterative solution, thereby ensuring
that it has even lower computational cost. In the next few paragraphs we demonstrate this
facet of the HLLI Riemann solver for RMHD.

Figure 4 shows two simulations of an isolated, stationary contact discontinuity as sug-
gested by Honkkila & Janhunen (2007). The density variable is shown. We use the same
parameters as the previous authors and we run the simulation to a ﬁnal time that is ten
times larger than the one suggested by Honkkila and Janhunen. The result from the HLLI
Riemann solver is shown with ﬁlled dots, the result from the HLL Riemann solver is shown
with crosses. We see that the HLL Riemann solver has produced signiﬁcant dissipation of the
contact discontinuity, while the HLLI Riemann solver has captured the contact discontinuity
exactly.

Figure 5 shows two simulations of an isolated, stationary Alfven wave. The transverse ve-

locity and magnetic ﬁeld are shown. This problem was suggested by (Mignone, Ugliano and Bodo(2009)
and we use the same parameters as the previous authors but we run the simulation to a ﬁnal
time that is four times larger than the ﬁnal time quoted by Mignone, Ugliano and Bodo
(2009). The result from the HLLI Riemann solver is shown with ﬁlled dots, the result from
the HLL Riemann solver is shown with crosses. As before, we see that the HLL Riemann
solver has produced signiﬁcant dissipation of the Alfven wave discontinuity, while the HLLI

Riemann solver has captured the Alfven wave discontinuity exactly. Figures 4 and 5 both
used a standard, second order scheme, the only diﬀerence being the use of the HLLI Riemann
solver.

6. Multidimensional Propagation of Alfven Waves

Figures 4 and 5 showed that the one-dimensional HLLI Riemann solver can dramatically
reduce the dissipation compared to the HLL Riemann solver. Multidimensional treatment
of Alfven waves on a computational mesh requires a multidimensional Riemann solver. In
Balsara (2004), we were able to formulate a test problem that measures the ability of a
multidimensional MHD code to propagate Alfven waves with the least amount of dissipation.
It has been shown that this test problem is very important in benchmarking the dissipation
characteristics of multidimensional codes for classical MHD. The analogous problem which
benchmarks the low dissipation propagation of Alfven waves in RMHD has been recently
presented in Balsara and Kim (2016).
It consists of torsional Alfven waves propagating
obliquely to the mesh lines of a two-dimensional mesh. We do not repeat the problem
description. Instead, we show the results and intercompare with older methods that involve
dissipation doubling from Gardiner and Stone (2005, 2008).

Figure 6 shows the results of the torsional Alfven wave dissipation test from Balsara
and Kim (2016). In Figure 6, we use the same second order reconstruction algorithm from
the RMHD version of the RIEMANN code. Figure 6a shows the decay in the z-component
of the velocity of the Alfven wave as a function of time. Figure 6b shows the same for the
z-component of the magnetic ﬁeld of the Alfven wave. The vertical axis is logarithmically
scaled. A faster rate of decline in Figure 6 indicates that the associated numerical scheme has
higher dissipation. The curve that is labeled “MuSIC+1DHLLI” uses the one-dimensional
HLLI Riemann solver at the zone faces and the MuSIC Riemann solver with sub-structure
at the zone edges. We see that it displays minimal dissipation. This is because the MuSIC
Riemann solver is designed to be the exact, multidimensional analogue of the one-dimensional
HLLI Riemann solver. The curve that is labeled “MuSIC-NoSS+1DHLLI” uses the same
algorithmic combination with one simple exception. The MuSIC Riemann solver is prevented
from endowing sub-structure to the strongly-interacting state. We see that when the sub-
structure in the MuSIC Riemann solver is artiﬁcially removed, the dissipation of Alfven
waves increases. This makes the very nice point that all facets of the newly designed MuSIC
Riemann solver play a role in reducing dissipation. It is very useful to cross-compare with
the dissipation doubling ideas from Gardiner and Stone (2005, 2008). The curve that is
labeled “1D HLLC (dissipation doubling)” doubles the dissipation in the HLLC Riemann

– 21 –

solver using the ideas from Gardiner and Stone (2005, 2008). Despite the one-dimensional
HLLC Riemann solver being an able performer, we see that it dramatically increases the
dissipation that is provided to the torsional Alfven waves. Lastly, one is most interested
in understanding what happens when the dissipation doubling ideas from Gardiner & Stone
(2005, 2008) are applied to the one-dimensional HLL Riemann solver. This is shown in
Figure 6 by the curve labeled “1D HLL (dissipation doubling)”. We see that Alfven waves
are strongly dissipated.

It should also be emphasized that the reconstruction that was used in Figure 6 is the
linear part of the r=3 WENO reconstruction. This is already a very superior reconstruction
strategy. It is almost as superior as a true third order reconstruction strategy. It is quite
possible that reconstruction is done with a second order TVD limiter, like the MC limiter.
In that case, the analogous results are shown in Figure 7. We see considerably increased
dissipation in Figure 7 compared to Figure 6.

In Balsara & Kim (2016), ADER-WENO schemes were designed that go all the way
up to fourth order of accuracy. It is, therefore, very interesting to ask whether improved
accuracy gives us an improved result for the propagation of torsional Alfven waves. Figure 8
shows the propagation of torsional Alfven waves when second, third and fourth order ADER-
WENO schemes are used. All these schemes used the one-dimensional HLLI Riemann solver
at the zone faces and the MuSIC Riemann solver with sub-structure at the zone edges. We
clearly see that the higher order schemes show vastly reduced dissipation. In Balsara & Kim
(2016), we also demonstrate that modern high order schemes perform robustly even in the
vicinity of strong shocks. Thus the barrier to their use in astrophysics is dramatically reduced
by this work.

7. Discussion and Future Prospects

In this article, we present a discussion of the subtle points uniquely associated with
numerical simulations of event horizon magnetospheres. In the Appendix we show that the
Alven or intermediate polarization transports a unique component of the numerical ﬂux
(the totally transverse momentum) and is the only RMHD mode that propagates a physical
charge. This was shown in Section 3 to be particularly relevant to the time evolution of
event horizon magnetospheres that rotate very rapidly and therefore need to establish large
Goldreich-Julian charge densities. It was further shown that all inﬂows must pass through
an IACS, thereby rendering the interior region out of Alfven wave communication with the
out-ﬂowing wind. The IACS is a charge horizon for the global ﬂow. Figure 2 illustrated
that the IACS causally excises most of the active region of space-time (the ergosphere) that

Fig. 8.— Figure 8 shows the same Alfven wave propagation test. This time, we used diﬀerent
ADER-WENO schemes with increasing order of accuracy. We see that higher order schemes
produce lower dissipation.

would be the putative element to enforce rapid rotation of the system. The implication
is that simulations of event horizon magnetospheres should be performed with numerical
schemes that represent the Alfvenic properties of the system with high ﬁdelity.

In Sections 4 - 6, it was demonstrated that an improvement of numerical accuracy can be
attained by utilizing numerical schemes based on HLLI and MuSIC Riemann solvers rather
than schemes based on 1-D HLL solvers. In particular, we showed in Sections 5 and 6 that
the HLL Riemann solver will strongly dissipate Alfven waves and contact discontinuities.
As such, schemes based on this solver do not respect the global critical point structure
of inﬂows in the event horizon magnetosphere near the IACS. Residuals of the dissipated
waves emerge in adjacent cells upstream irrespective of the IACS. In particular, for 1-D
RMHD solvers, the HLLI Riemann solver provides the theoretical minimum dissipation of
the Alfven wave and contact discontinuities that can still ensure a numerically stable scheme.
In Section 6, we discussed the multidimensional extension of HLLI RMHD Riemann solver;
the RMHD MuSIC Riemann solver. It is in higher dimensions that we see an even larger
improvement over schemes based on 1-D HLL solvers. The MuSIC Riemann solver was
shown to signiﬁcantly reduce the dissipation of Alfven waves in large part to its ability to
resolve the strongly interacting region that is typically ignored in schemes based on 1-D HLL
Riemann solvers.

Low Alfven and contact discontinuity dissipation in a numerical scheme, such as those
based on MuSIC, should allow the proper disposition the following unique circumstances
endemic to event horizon magnetospheres that were discussed in the Introduction.

– 24 –

1. At the risk of being repetitive, the paired wind systems evolves outward and inward
towards two asymptotic inﬁnities as opposed to having a causal MHD boundary at
one terminus. Thus, unlike other MHD wind problems there is a more complex critical
point structure. Most speciﬁcally, all inﬂows pass through the inner Alfven critical
surface. Thereby causally disconnecting the outﬂowing wind from Alfven radiation
emanating from the majority the rapidly rotating ergospheric plasma. The Alfven
wave is the only wave that propagates a physical charge and thus should be involved
in the establishment of the Goldreich-Julian charge density or equivalently, the ﬁeld
line rotation rate, ΩF . Thus, reducing the numerical dissipation of the Alfven wave
by implementing the HLLI or MuSIC Riemann solvers would seem to be a signiﬁcant
improvement over an HLL solver that strongly dissipates the Alfven wave.

2. The paired wind system constantly drains itself of plasma in the MHD limit. Thus,
plasma injection by means of a mass ﬂoor is required. This process will dissipate MHD
waves generated by the MHD system and inject new MHD waves. The process is
nontrivial and has been shown to modify ΩF signiﬁcantly in certain 3-D simulations.
Since, in principle, it can modify ΩF and mass injection perturbs the Alfven waves
generated in the system, a Riemann solver that dissipates Alfven waves less than the
HLL Riemann solver might shed light on the nature of the transients that occur as
diﬀerent plasma injection scenarios are explored.

3. Another related issue is the large numerical diﬀusion of plasma from the bounding
accretion disk into the event horizon magnetosphere with Riemann solvers that do not
respect the contact discontinuity, such as the HLL Riemann solver. Since the source of
plasma injection might be important to the establishment of ΩF this is an important
issue as well. Riemann solvers, such as the HLLI or MUSIC Riemann solvers, which
treat contact discontinuities explicitly can help in this regard.

In this article, we presented both theoretical and numerical arguments that support the
notion that numerical schemes based on the multi-dimensional MuSIC Riemann solver can
potentially provide an improvement over existing methods of modeling 3-D event horizon
magnetospheres. In particular, the MuSIC Riemann solver is both well suited for the low
density environment endemic to the event horizon magnetosphere and it provides reduced
dissipation of the Alfven and contact discontinuities.
It is also computationally eﬃcient
which oﬀsets the cost of improving the computational accuracy. In Balsara & Kim (2016)
we provide a subluminal scheme for RMHD as well as a discussion of the MuSIC Riemann
solver. The reader who wishes to get further information can also visit the second author’s

A. Appendix: Isolated Alfven Discontinuities

This Appendix derives the properties of isolated fast, slow and Alfven (or intermediate)
discontinuities. The emphasis is on deﬁning the information that is propagated along the
Alfven characteristics of the MHD system of equations. It is demonstrated that the momen-
tum ﬂux separates into two components that are propagated by the fast and slow modes and
a third component carried exclusively by the Alfven mode. The electric polarization of the
Alfven discontinuity is also unique, it is the only MHD wave that propagates a longitudinal
polarization and a physical charge. In the limit of vanishing mass density, Punsly (2004),
derived some of these results previously.

A.1. Perturbed Downstream Quantities in the Proper Upstream Frame

In the proper upstream plasma frame, one can deﬁne the downstream perturbations
induced by the isolated discontinuity. Mathematically, a propagating discontinuity is a
Heaviside step wave.

Equations (A29) - (A31) are the primary results of this section. It will be shown that
the third equation decouples from the other two equations. The third equation depends on
the component 3 only and this momentum ﬂux component will be shown to be determined
entirely by the ALfven wave. We can label Equation (A29) as the longitudinal momentum
ﬂux equation. Equation (A30) is the momentum ﬂux that is that is transverse to the propa-
gation direction, but not the magnetic ﬁeld, this can be called the transverse momentum ﬂux
equation. Equation (A31) is the momentum ﬂux that is transverse to both the magnetic ﬁeld
and propagation direction. It can be called the totally transverse momentum ﬂux equation.
To see that Equation (A31) is unique to the Alfven wave, combining with Equation (A24)
one ﬁnds that there is a a unique wave four-velocity

Conversely, Equations (A29) and (A30) are coupled and govern the magnetosonic modes.

The two roots of Equation (A33) are the wave speeds of the fast and slow modes (Punsly
2008). Thus, Equations (A29) - (A33) indicate that the magnetosonic waves mediate the
ﬂow of longitudinal and transverse momentum ﬂux. The Alfven mode regulates the totally
transverse momentum ﬂux. This is a coordinate invariant statement. There is a unique
component of the momentum ﬂux that can be transported only by the Alfven wave. To
write this in coordinate independent form, ﬁrst deﬁne the spacelike vector ek

[ek]α = (gαβ + uαuβ)Kβ ,

(A34)

where Equation (2) deﬁnes the wave velocity four-vector. Deﬁne the totally transverse space-
like direction as eT T , where

[eT T ]α = ǫαβγδuδ[ek]γ ∗ Fβλuλ ,

(A35)

where the magnetic ﬁeld direction in the proper frame is deﬁned in terms of the dual to the
Faraday tensor, ∗Fβλ. The covariant deﬁnition of the totally transverse moment ﬂux TT T is
(A36)

TT T ≡ [ek]µ[eT T ]νTµν .

Thus, one can determine the component of the numerical ﬂux that should be propagated by
the Alfven discontinuity in each time step of a conservative MHD numerical scheme in any
coordinate system or mesh.

In order to determine the unique electromagnetic content of Equation (A31), one can

(A37)

There are two solutions. First, if the wave speed is not the Alfven speed in Equation (A32),
δE ′
1 = 0 and by Gauss Law the surface charge density is zero. Thus, the fast and slow waves
carry no surface charge. If the wave travels at the Alfven speed, then by Equations (A19)
and (A24), for any oblique Alfven wave

′

δE

(A38)

Thus, by Gauss’ Law, oblique Alfven waves have a surface charge. The only ideal MHD
wave that propagates a physical charge is the Alfven wave.
