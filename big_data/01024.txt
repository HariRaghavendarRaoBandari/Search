RESIDUAL-BASED A POSTERIORI ERROR ESTIMATE FOR

INTERFACE PROBLEMS:

NONCONFORMING LINEAR ELEMENTS

ZHIQIANG CAI, CUIYU HE, AND SHUN ZHANG

Abstract. In this paper, we study a modiﬁed residual-based a posteriori
error estimator for the nonconforming linear ﬁnite element approximation to
the interface problem. The reliability of the estimator is analyzed by a new and
direct approach without using the Helmholtz decomposition. It is proved that
the estimator is reliable with constant independent of the jump of diﬀusion
coeﬃcients across the interfaces, without the assumption that the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient is quasi-monotone. Numerical results for one test problem with
intersecting interfaces are also presented.

1. Introduction

During the past decade, the construction, analysis, and implementation of robust
a posteriori error estimators for various ﬁnite element approximations to partial dif-
ferential equations with parameters have been one of the focuses of research in the
ﬁeld of the a posteriori error estimation. For the elliptic interface problem, vari-
ous robust estimators have been constructed, analyzed, and implemented (see, e.g.,
[4, 23, 22, 8, 9, 11, 26, 12] for conforming elements, [1, 20, 10] for nonconforming ele-
ments, [10] for mixed elements, and [7] for discontinuous elements). The robustness
for residual based estimators in the reliability bound is established theoretically un-
der the assumption of the quasi-monotone distribution of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients,
see [4] for more details. However, numerical results by many researchers including
ours strongly suggest that those estimators are robust even when the diﬀusion co-
eﬃcients are not quasi-monotone. In this paper, we provide a theoretical evidence
for the nonconforming linear element without the quasi-monotone assumption.

One of the key steps in obtaining the robust reliability bound of classical residual
based estimator is to construct a modiﬁed Cl´ement-type interpolation operator
satisfying speciﬁc approximation and stability properties in the energy norm (see
[4] for details). For the conforming linear element, the degrees of freedom are the
nodal values at vertices of triangles. The nodal value of the modiﬁed Cl´ement-
type interpolation is deﬁned by the average value of the function over connected
elements whose corresponding diﬀusion coeﬃcients are the greatest. Under the
quasi-monotone assumption, Bernardi and Verf¨urth [4] were able to establish the
required properties of the interpolation operator to guarantee the robust reliability

bound. A key advantage for the nonconforming linear element is that its degrees of
freedom are nodal values at the middle points of edges of triangles and that each
middle point is shared by at most two triangles. Hence, we are able to construct a
modiﬁed Cl´ement-type interpolation satisfying the desired properties without the
quasi-monotonicity assumption (see Section 4).

The a posteriori error estimation for the nonconforming elements has been stud-
ied by many researchers. Due to the lack of the error equation, Dari, Duran, Padra,
and Vampa [14] established the reliability bound of the residual-based error esti-
mator for the Poisson equation through the Helmholtz decomposition of the true
error. Their analysis is widely used by other researchers (see, e.g., [13, 5, 1, 6]), and
the Helmholtz decomposition becomes a necessary tool for obtaining the reliability
bound for the nonconforming elements. This approach has also been applied to
the mixed ﬁnite element method [21] and discontinuous Garlerkin ﬁnite element
method [3, 2, 7]. It is obvious that application of their analysis to the interface
problem will lead to the same distribution assumption as the conforming elements
in [4].

Ainsworth [1] constructed an equilibrated estimator without using the Cl´ement
type interpolation but the error bounds depend on the jump of diﬀusion constants.
Despite the main trend of using Helmholtz decomposition in the nonconforming
ﬁnite element analysis, there are several other interesting papers that approached
diﬀerently. Hoppe and Wohlmuth [18] constructed two a posteriori error estimators
by using the hierarchical basis under the saturation assumption. Schieweck [24]
constructed a two-sided bound of the energy error using the analysis of conforming
case with some simple additional arguments. Nevertheless, conforming Cl´ement
type interpolation was applied in that paper hence again impose the assumption of
quasi-monotonicity.

The purpose of this paper is to present a new and direct analysis, which does
not involve the Helmholtz decomposition, for estimating the reliability bound with
the aim of removing the quasi-monotone assumption. To do so, our analysis makes
use of (a) our newly developed error equation for the nonconforming ﬁnite element
approximation in [7] and (b) the structure of the nonconforming elements. Com-
bining with our observation on the modiﬁed Cl´ement-type interpolation for the
nonconforming elements, we are able to bound both the element residuals and the
numerical ﬂux jumps uniformly without the quasi-monotonicity assumption. Un-
fortunately, we are unable to do the same for the numerical edge solution jump.
As an alternative, we modify the edge solution jump at elements where the quasi-
monotonicity assumption is not satisﬁed. The modiﬁed estimator is proved to be
reliable with constant independent of the jump of the diﬀusion coeﬃcients across
interfaces without the quasi-monotonicity assumption. By using the standard ar-
gument (see, e.g., [4]), we also establish local eﬃciency bounds uniformly with
respect to the jump of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. This robustness is obtained for the
standard (modiﬁed) indicators without (with) the quasi-monotonicity assumption.
Nevertheless, numerical results presented in Section 7 for a benchmark test prob-
lem seems to suggest that the modiﬁed indicator generates a better mesh than the
standard indicator.

Existing residual based estimators consist of the element residual, the edge ﬂux
jump, and the edge tangential derivative jump due to the Helmholtz decomposition.
As a by-product of our direct approach (see (2.9)), the residual based estimators

to be studied in this paper replace the edge tangential derivative jump by the edge
solution jump. Even though they are equivalent in two dimensions, numerical result
shows that our estimator is more accurate than the existing estimators (see Figure
6).

The outline of the paper is as follows. The interface problem and its noncon-
forming ﬁnite element approximation are introduced in Section 2 as well as the
L2 representation of the true error in the (broken) energy norm. The “standard”
and modiﬁed indicators and estimators are presented in Section 3. The modiﬁed
Cl´ement-type interpolation operator is deﬁned and its approximation properties
are proved in Section 4. Robust local eﬃciency and global reliability bounds are
established in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Finally, we provide some numerical
results in Section 7.

2. Nonconforming Linear Finite Element Approximation to Interface

Problem

2.1. Interface Problem. For simplicity of the presentation, we consider only two
dimensions. Extension of the results in this paper to three dimensions is straight-
forward. Let Ω be a bounded, open, connected subset of ℜ2 with a Lipschitz
continuous boundary ∂Ω. Denote by n = (n1, n2)t the outward unit vector normal
to the boundary. We partition the boundary of the domain Ω into two open subsets
ΓD and ΓN such that ∂Ω = ¯ΓD ∪ ¯ΓN and that ΓD ∩ ΓN = ∅. For simplicity, we
assume that ΓD is not empty (i.e., mes (ΓD) 6= 0). Consider the following elliptic
interface problem

(2.1)

with boundary conditions

− ∇ · (α(x)∇ u) = f

in Ω

u = gD on ΓD and n · (α∇ u) = gN

(2.2)
where ∇· and ∇ are the divergence and gradient operators, respectively; f , gD ,
and gN are given scalar-valued functions; and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient α > 0 is
¯Ωi. Here
piecewise constant with respect to a partition of the domain ¯Ω =

on ΓN ,

n

Si=1

the subdomain Ωi is open and polygonal. The jump of the α across interfaces
(subdomain boundaries) are possibly very large. For simplicity, assume that f , gD ,
and gN are piecewise linear functions.

We use the standard notations and deﬁnitions for the Sobolev spaces H s(Ω) and
H s(∂Ω) for s ≥ 0. The standard associated inner products are denoted by (·, ·)s,Ω
and (·, ·)s,∂Ω, and their respective norms are denoted by k · ks,Ω and k · ks,∂Ω. (We
omit the subscript Ω from the inner product and norm designation when there is
no risk of confusion.) For s = 0, H s(Ω) coincides with L2(Ω). In this case, the
inner product and norm will be denoted by k · k and (·, ·), respectively. Let

H 1
g,D(Ω) := {v ∈ H 1( Ω ) : v = gD on ΓD}.

The corresponding variational formulation of problem (2.1)-(2.2) is to ﬁnd u ∈
H 1
g,D(Ω) such that

(2.3)

∀ v ∈ H 1
where the bilinear and linear forms are deﬁned by

a(u, v) = f (v),

0,D(Ω),

a(u, v) = (α(x)∇u,∇v)Ω and f (v) = (f, v)Ω + (gN , v)ΓN .

2.2. Nonconforming Linear Finite Element Approximation. Let T h be a
triangulation of the domain Ω. Assume that T h is regular; i.e., for all K ∈ T h,
there exist a positive constant κ such that

hK ≤ κ ρK,

where hK denotes the diameter of the element K and ρK the diameter of the largest
circle that may be inscribed in K. Note that the assumption of the mesh regularity
does not exclude highly, locally reﬁned meshes. Let

with the triangulation T h by

Denote the nonconforming piecewise linear ﬁnite element space, i.e., the Crouzeix-
Raviart element [17], associated with the triangulation T h by

Let

For any v, w ∈ H 1(T h), denote the (broken) bilinear form by

respectively, then the true error in the (broken) energy norm may be expressed in
terms of those quantities.

Lemma 2.1. Let Eh ∈ U nc

0,D be an interpolation of E, then we have the following

(rK, E−Eh)K−Xe∈E h

3. Indicator and Estimator

In this section, based on the L2 representation of the true error in the energy
norm in Lemma 2.1, we ﬁrst introduce the “standard” indicator and the corre-
sponding estimator. Our standard estimator consists of the usual element residual
and edge ﬂux jump plus the edge solution jump that replaces the edge tangen-
tial derivative jump of existing residual based estimators. Since the robustness
of the reliability bound of estimators was established under the quasi-monotonicity
assumption on the distribution of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, to avoid such an assump-
tion we introduce a new indicator and the corresponding estimator by modifying
the edge solution jump at elements where the quasi-monotonicity assumption fails.
K, respectively, the sets of three vertices
and three edges of K. Denote the respective indicators of element residual, edge
ﬂux jump, and edge solution jump by

Remark 3.1. Instead of using the edge tangential derivative jump as existing residual-
based error estimators, the indicator ηK and the resulting estimator η above employ
the edge solution jump ηJu,K. In two dimensions, the edge solution jump is equiv-
alent to the tangential derivative jump (see (5.4)). Nevertheless, numerical results
for a test problem show that our estimator is more accurate than the existing
estimators using the edge tangential derivative jump.

By the standard argument [4], it is shown in Section 5 that the indicator ηK is
eﬃcient uniformly with respect to the jump of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. By using
the Helmholtz decomposition and the modiﬁed Cl´ement-type interpolation, one
can also prove that the estimator η is reliable. Moreover, the reliability constant
is independent of the jump of α(x) provided that the distribution of α(x) is quasi-
monotone [23].
In order to remove this assumption, we present a new analysis
for estimating the reliability bound without using the Helmholtz decomposition.
The analysis will make use of the structure of the nonconforming element in two-
dimensions, and it enables us to bound both the element residual and the numerical
ﬂux jump uniformly without the quasi-monotonicity. Unfortunately, we are unable
to do the same for the numerical solution jump. As an alternative, we modify the

indicator of the numerical solution jump at elements where the quasi-monotonicity
is not satisﬁed.

To this end, for each vertex z ∈ N h, denote by ωh

4. The Modified Cl´ement-type Interpolation

type interpolation operator for the non-conforming linear element and establish its
approximation properties.

Denote by

2-dimensional Lebesgue measure meas(ω). With this convention, set

(4.1)

(πev)φe,

Ih(v) = Xe∈E h

where φe is the nodal basis function of U nc which takes value 1 at me and takes 0
at mid-points of other edges.
For any K ∈ T h, let △K be the union of elements in T h sharing an edge with
K. For any e ∈ E h, let △e be the union of elements in T h having the common edge
e.

Here and thereafter, we use the a . b notation to indicate that a ≤ c b for a
further not speﬁciﬁed constant c, which depends only on the shape regularity of
T h but not on the data of the underlying problems, in particular, the jump of the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Unlike the modiﬁed Cl´ement interpolation for the conforming
elements, there is an extra jump term in the approximation property in (4.2) which
is due to the discontinuity of the function v across the edges of K.
Proof. For any K ∈ T h, since the nodal basis functions form a partition of the
unity, the triangle inequality gives

5. Local Efficiency Bound

In this section, we establish local eﬃciency bounds for the indicators ηK and
˜ηK deﬁned, respectively, in (3.1) and (3.3). Both the bounds are independent of
the jump of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, this robustness is obtained without (with) the
quasi-monotonicity assumption (see [4]) for the indicator ηK (˜ηK ). Nevertheless,
numerical results presented in Section 7 for a benchmark test problem seems to
suggest that the modiﬁed indicator ˜ηK generates a better mesh than the standard
indicator ηK. By using local edge and element bubble functions, ψe and ψK (see
[25] for their deﬁnitions and properties), it is a common practice to obtain the local
eﬃciency bound for the residual-based a posteriori error estimator. By properly
weighting terms in the indicator by the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, one can show that the
local eﬃciency bound is robust without the quasi-monotonicity assumption. For
the convenience of readers, we only sketch the proof in the following theorem.
Theorem 5.1. (Local Eﬃciency) Assuming that u ∈ H 1+ǫ(Ω) and uh are the
solutions of (2.3) and (2.4), respectively, then the indicator ηK satisﬁes the following
local eﬃciency bound:

(5.3), and (5.5). This completes the proof of the theorem.

z to the element Kz ∈ ˆωh

Next, we establish the local eﬃciency bound for the modiﬁed indicator ˜ηK. To
this end, let K ∈ T h be an element having at least one vertex z ∈ NM . From the
element K ∈ ωh
z , where Kz is chosen in the deﬁnition
of the operator Ih/2 in Section 3, there are at most two possible paths (clockwise
or counter-clockwise) in ωh
on one
of the paths such that the maximum of the ratio between αK and the diﬀusion
coeﬃcients over elements on that path is the smallest. Let

Proof. Without loss of generality, we prove (5.6) only when z ∈ N h
I . In the case
when z ∈ N h

that there are k elements in ˆωh/2

7. Numerical Experiments

In this section, we report some numerical results for an interface problem with
intersecting interfaces used by many authors (see, e.g., [19, 7]), which is considered
as a benchmark test problem. Let Ω = (−1, 1)2 and

u(r, θ) = rβµ(θ)

in the polar coordinates at the origin with

µ(θ) =




cos((π/2 − σ)β) · cos((θ − π/2 + ρ)β)
cos(ρβ) · cos((θ − π + σ)β)
cos(σβ) · cos((θ − π − ρ)β)
cos((π/2 − ρ)β) · cos((θ − 3π/2 − σ)β)

if 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2,
if π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π,
if π ≤ θ ≤ 3π/2,
if 3π/2 ≤ θ ≤ 2π,

where σ and ρ are numbers. The function u(r, θ) satisﬁes the interface problem in
(2.1) with ΓN = ∅, f = 0, and
α(x) =( R

in (0, 1)2 ∪ (−1, 0)2,
in Ω \ ([0, 1]2 ∪ [−1, 0]2).

The numbers β, R, σ, and ρ satisfy some nonlinear relations. For example, when
β = 0.1, then

1

R ≈ 161.4476387975881,

ρ = π/4,

and σ ≈ −14.92256510455152.

Note that when β = 0.1, this is a diﬃcult problem for computation.

Remark 7.1. This problem does not satisfy Hypothesis 2.7 in [4] as the quasi-
monotonicity is not satisﬁed about the origin.

Started with a coarse triangulation, a sequence of meshes is generated by using
a standard adaptive meshing algorithm that adopts the L2 strategy: (i) mark
elements whose indicators are among the ﬁrst 20 percent of the energy norm of
the total error, and (ii) reﬁne the marked triangles by bisection. The stopping
criteria

is used, and numerical results with tol = 0.1 are reported.

Figure 4. error and

Meshes generated by the standard and modiﬁed indicators, ηK and ˜ηK , are
depicted respectively in Figures 1 and 2. Both the reﬁnements are centered at the
origin. There are 11974 and 5524 elements in the respective Figures 1 and 2. Hence,
this test problem suggests that the modiﬁed indicator generates a much better mesh
than the standard indicator even though the local eﬃciency bound of the modiﬁed
indicator depends on the jump of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient.

The comparisons of the true error and the estimators η and ˜η on the meshes
generated by the standard and modiﬁed indicators are shown in Figures 3 and 4,
respectively. The slope of the log(dof)- log(error) for both the estimators on both
the meshes are very close to −1/2, which indicates the optimal decay of the error
with respect to the number of unknowns. The eﬃciency index is deﬁned by

eﬀ-index :=

estimator
|||u − uh|||Ω

The eﬃcinecy indices for the η and ˜η are about 0.6404 and 1.7469 on the mesh
generated by ηK and about 0.9582 and 1.0282 on the mesh generated by ˜ηK , re-
spectively.

RESIDUAL-BASED A POSTERIORI ESTIMATE FOR NONCONFORMING ELEMENTS 19

Our numerical results also show that our standard estimator using the edge so-
lution jump is more accurate than the existing estimators using the edge tangential
jump. To illustrate this fact, we present numerical results for a test problem [16]:
a Poisson equation deﬁned on the L-shaped domain Ω = (−1, 1)2 \ [0, 1] × [−1, 0]
with the following exact solution

3 (cid:19) ,
u(x, θ) = r2/3 sin(cid:18) 2θ + π

θ ∈ [0, 3π/2].

The stopping criteria is set as tol ≤ 0.0075. The eﬃciency indices in the ﬁnal
step are 0.8205 and 2.8423 for the respective estimators with the edge solution and
tangential derivative jumps. This indicates that our standard estimator is more
accurate than the existing residual estimator (see Figure 6).
