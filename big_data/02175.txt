Abstract

In this paper, we mine and learn to predict how similar a
pair of users’ interests towards videos are, based on demo-
graphic (age, gender and location) and social (friendship, in-
teraction and group membership) information of these users.
We use the video access patterns of active users as ground
truth (a form of benchmark). We adopt tag-based user proﬁl-
ing to establish this ground truth, and justify why it is used
instead of video-based methods, or many latent topic models
such as LDA and Collaborative Filtering approaches. We then
show the effectiveness of the different demographic and so-
cial features, and their combinations and derivatives, in pre-
dicting user interest similarity, based on different machine-
learning methods for combining multiple features. We pro-
pose a hybrid tree-encoded linear model for combining the
features, and show that it out-performs other linear and tree-
based models. Our methods can be used to predict user in-
terest similarity when the ground-truth is not available, e.g.
for new users, or inactive users whose interests may have
changed from old access data, and is useful for video recom-
mendation. Our study is based on a rich dataset from Tencent,
a popular service provider of social networks, video services,
and various other services in China.

1 Introduction

Online social networks (OSNs) have become very popu-
lar over the last decade. OSNs connect friends, let them
share contents, whether generated by themselves or from
public sources, and let them interact. An interesting ques-
tion is to what extent we can predict the interest similar-
ity of any pair of users, given their demographic and so-
cial interaction information available from an OSN provider.
The ability for such inference can obviously be very use-
ful, for improving services and making various recom-
mendations to users (Lewis, Gonzalez, and Kaufman 2012;
Yu and Houg 2014). In this paper, we focus on the inference
of users’ interest similarity for videos, based on various in-
formation gathered from OSNs.

Typically, a video service provider may only have users’
past video consumption data, and use that for develop-
ing users’ video interest proﬁles. There are various tech-
niques, notably collaborative ﬁltering (CF) and its vari-
ants (Su and Khoshgoftaar 2009). In practice, the adoption
of CF is not without its challenges, especially in a system
continuously with a large percentage of new and inactive

users, and high rate of content churn and change in user in-
terests. Our study of inferring user interest similarity based
on other user information (apart from video consumption
data), if the results are positive, can greatly help remedy the
situation.

Without content categorization (which can be done by CF
or other methods), computing and comparing two users’ in-
terest similarity directly from the items (videos) they con-
sumed in the past can be quite misleading. For example, two
users may have similar interests, but due to the large stock of
videos available and the users only consumed a tiny sample
from the entire population, there is no overlap in the videos
they actually consumed. This leads to the wrong conclusion
that the users have no common interests. So a prerequisite
to any study of user interest similarity is a system to catego-
rize the items (videos). In our study, we rely on a tag-based
video categorization system, because it is already available
from the data source. Each video can have multiple tags.
The set of tags are manually generated by multiple editors,
which can be considered as a folksonomy approach. We de-
velop two methods to count the tagging information for the
purpose of comparing user interests. One method is based on
the frequency of common tags between users, called Popular
Tag based Proﬁling (PTP); and the other method takes into
account the representativeness of the tags, called Represen-
tative Tag based Proﬁling (RTP).

Given PTP and RTP, we can systematically study the
interest correlation of active users (because we have their
video consumption data) for different features, including de-
mographic (e.g. age, gender, location) or social ones (friend-
ship, community membership, and interaction information).
We also studied the similarity of a user’s interest with her
past; and with the average of all users. This is the ﬁrst part
of our results. The results show that we can effectively iden-
tify the usefulness of different features, and some of them
can help infer user similarity effectively.

Then we apply different machine learning models, includ-
ing linear models, tree-based models, and a hybrid model
developed by ourselves, to learn how to best use the avail-
able features to infer user interest similarity when we have
no consumption data. This is the second part of our results.
The results show that our hybrid method out-performs the
others.

To demonstrate the beneﬁt of our results in real applica-

tions, we further apply the similarity inferred from our mod-
els to video recommendation, and implement several bench-
marks for comparison. The experiment results validate the
strength of our prediction model and the tag-based user pro-
ﬁling scheme in real applications. Moreover, While PTP can
result in more accurate recommendations, RTP can produce
more diverse recommendations.

Our study is based on data from our collaborator, Ten-
cent, a large OSN provider that also provides other online
services, including video streaming.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec 2 de-
scribes the system and data we studied. We deﬁne the two
tag-based user proﬁling methods, PTP and RTP, and the cor-
responding interest similarity calculation in Sec 3. We then
investigate the correlation between various user information
and interest similarity in Sec. 4. Experiments of interest sim-
ilarity prediction are detailed in Sec. 5, while Sec. 6 further
applies the predicted results into video recommendation. We
conclude in Sec. 8, and related works are summarized and
discussed in Sec. 7.

2 System Overview and Data Description

We brieﬂy introduce the system we studied and the available
data in this section.

Our collaborator, Tencent Inc., runs an online platform
that provides multiple services, including online games, on-
line videos, and instant messaging (QQ), and facilitates the
formation of QQ groups. Tencent QQ is the most popular
Instant Messaging service in China with roughly 843 mil-
lion active QQ accounts in June 2015. Users in Tencent QQ
can make friends, chat with friends and join QQ groups. QQ
groups allow users to easily communicate within a small cir-
cle of typically 50 to 100 users, sharing common interests.
Tencent Video is one of the largest online video providers
in China, supporting millions of daily active users. Tencent
Video’s video catalog includes movies, TV episodes, music
videos, news, user generated content, and more. In this pa-
per, we analyzed comprehensive user-related information:
• Demographic information: Demographic information in-
cludes age, gender, location, occupation and income. On
analyzing the most users, we used three types of demo-
graphic information, namely, gender, age, and location.
• Social relationship: In this paper, we considered friend-
ship, social interaction and group membership of users.
• Interest data: This work focused on user interest for
videos. We utilized user’s video access records over time.
To help discuss our ideas precisely, we deﬁne some nota-
tions. The sets of users and videos are denoted by U and
I, respectively. Total number of users is |U|. We use u and
v as the indices of users, and m and n as the indices of
videos. The gender, age and location of a user u are repre-
sented by gu, au and lu. User u’s friend set is Fu and we de-
note the friendship between user u and v as F (u, v), where
F (u, v) = 1 if u ∈ Fv and v ∈ Fu. Note, the friendship
in Tencent QQ is reciprocal. The QQ groups joined by user
u is denoted as Gu. Interaction (messaging) between friends
on a certain day is represented by md(u, v), where d is the

index of the day (if we index the current day as 0, then the
past day is -1, and the like). The viewed video set of user u
1, which in fact is the traditional video-based proﬁle of
is Iu
user u.

3 User Interest Proﬁling based on Tags

In traditional CF with implicit feedback data, similarity be-
tween users is deﬁned as the ratio of common video con-
sumption. However, the available set of videos is so large
in most online video systems that two users may share
no common video access even if they have similar in-
terests. Thus, we proposed a tag-based proﬁling scheme
which is more general than the video-based proﬁling, that
is, two users who are similar under video-based proﬁling
also have a large similarity value using the tag-based pro-
ﬁling, and the reverse is not necessarily true. To achieve
this goal, Tencent Video employed many users (“editors”)
dedicated to viewing and labeling videos with one or more
tags from a predeﬁned tag vocabulary (in order to avoid
colloquial and noisy tag usage). For each video, tags used
by more than a certain proportion of editors are kept. Cur-
rently, there are around 30 thousand tags in the tag vo-
cabulary, and some examples are “visually intriguing”, “re-
ality show” and “mixed feelings”. We then generate tag-
based user proﬁles by fusing the user-video consumption
data and video-tag relations, that is, converting the user-
video-tag tripartite graph into a user-tag bipartite graph. In
this way, users consuming the same video will be labeled
with the same set of tags. Note that another potential ap-
proach to alleviate the weakness of video-based proﬁling
is to describe users’ interest by some latent topics derived
by matrix factorization (Koren, Bell, and Volinsky 2009) or
LDA (Krestel, Fankhauser, and Nejdl 2009) from the video
consumption and description data. However, the latent topic
based approaches require large-scale computation efforts,
which needs to be repeated as new user-item consumptions
come. Thereby, it’s more efﬁcient to utilize tag-based meth-
ods in practical systems, such as, Tencent Video.

In this paper, we are interested in users’ current interest
similarity that is more accurately captured by recent view-
ing behaviors, as justiﬁed by the observation of interest evo-
lution in the Sec. 4. We deﬁne active users as ones who have
viewed one or more videos in a recent target duration, such
as a week or a day, and inactive users as those without view-
ing records during this period. Note that it may be more pre-
cise to call them inactive users rather than new users because
they may be active in the past. And it’s common in Tencent
Video that users who were once active become inactive dur-
ing a certain recent period. Without loss of generality, we
use daily data to calculate the current interest similarity. We
further deﬁne some tag-related notations. The set of tags is
represented by T . We use i and j as the indices of tags. The
tag set of video m is denoted as Tm. The tag set of user u is
Tu = {i|i ∈ Tm, m ∈ Iu}, and the set of users who have
tag i is Ui = {u|i ∈ Tu}. The distribution of the sizes for
1Notations related to users’ viewing behaviors all refer to one
day’s data unless stated otherwise, and for simplicity, the time
stamp is omitted if there is no ambiguity.

users’ tag sets, i.e., |Tu|, is in Fig. 1(a).
Deﬁnition 1 (Popular Tag based Proﬁling, PTP). The
weight of tag i is proportional to the number of videos la-
beled by tag i and viewed by user u during a certain pe-
riod. The user proﬁle, obtained by aggregating the tag sets
of videos viewed by u, is denoted by2

u = (cid:8)(cid:0)i : wP

i = (cid:12)(cid:12){m|i ∈ Tm, m ∈ Iu}(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:9)

TP
The distribution of the number of users owning tag i, i.e.,
|Ui|, is shown in Fig. 1(b). We can observe that the distribu-
tion is quite skewed indicating that there are some popular
tags held by numerous users. Similar to TF-IDF in informa-
tion retrieval, to identify more informative and representa-
tive tags, we propose another tag-based proﬁling method by
penalizing tags that are very popular among user proﬁles.
The RTP method is effective in exploring users’ personal
long-tail interests, which will be shown in the experiments.

Besides user u’s individual preference of tag i, RTP also
considers the occurrence of tag i in all users’ tag lists. The

For each user proﬁling method, namely, PTP, RTP and

S R (u, v) =

Note that, we are not the ﬁrst one to propose tag-based
user proﬁling, however, the novelty lies in conducting exten-
sive empirical studies, similarity prediction and video rec-
ommendation experiments under the two different proﬁling
methods as shown in the following sections.

4 Correlation Study

In this section, we explore correlations between various user
features and interest similarity, and try to seek key features
that inﬂuence interest similarity through extensive empirical
study.

4.1 Correlation of User Demographics to Interest
We analyze how demographic information affects interest
similarity in terms of PTP and RTP. We consider three de-
mographic features: gender, age and location.

Gender. We measured the average interest similarity be-
tween user pairs with the same or different genders, and the
results are shown in Table 1.

Table 1: Average interest similarity vs. gender of two users

Male-male
Male-female
Female-female

PTP
0.1165
0.1305
0.1643

RTP
0.0562
0.0698
0.0914

The results show that, in both PTP and RTP cases, inter-
est similarity among females is on average larger than that
among males. One possible explanation is that females’ in-
terest is more concentrated leading to a higher probability to
share interests between females. To check this conjecture,
we randomly selected the same number of males and fe-
males, and found that the tag set for female group is smaller.
This means that females have a narrower range of video in-
terests compared to males.

Age. We ﬁltered out users of age greater than 40 or less
than 10 since there are few users in the two ranges. One in-
tuition is that users with close ages may be more alike. Thus,
we ﬁrst explored the relation between interest similarity and
age differences between any two users. However, almost no
distinction in the interest similarity was observed over dif-
ferent age differences.

It is possible that users in various generations differ in
their interest similarity. For example, two users of age 15
and 16 has the same age difference as that for users of
age 49 and 50, but the interest similarity may be not the
same. Therefore, we further explored the interest correla-
tion of age-age pairs instead of age differences. To illustrate
the measured interest similarity, we draw three-dimensional
plots as shown in Fig. 2.

Each point in Fig. 2 is the average interest similarity be-
tween users with the pair of ages. From the results, we can
observe that age pair as a feature contains more information
than the age difference, that is, age pair is more discrimina-
tive in similarity inference3.

Location.
Intuitively, people from the same place may be
interested in similar videos, such as local news. However,

3For the sake of statistical signiﬁcance, we drew a large number
of user pairs for each point. Similar treatment was adopted in the
other parts of the measurement.

interaction frequency, as shown in Fig. 3. Although the ﬁt-
ted curves4 in the RTP case is not the same as that for PTP,
they both show that users with higher intensity of interaction
share more interests, particularly when the interaction inten-
sity is very large. Also, interest similarity increases more
sharply when number of communicating days is small. Inter-
estingly, interaction frequency is more correlated with inter-
est similarity than interaction intensity, implying that some
casual or transactional interaction could also have a large
intensity.

from the empirical results, we found that the average sim-
ilarity between users from the same city is not higher than
random cases. This implies weak geographical limitation for
user video interests, while the QQ friendship shows stronger
locality, because in our dataset, the probability of two friends
from the same city is 18 times as high as that of two ran-
dom users. For the purpose of interest similarity prediction,
location pairs, as we measured, will be more useful than the
binary feature, i.e., whether two users are from the same city
or not.

Friendship. We ﬁrst examined direct friendship in gen-
eral. Results in Table 2 show that two friends appear to be
slightly more similar than a pair of strangers, but the differ-
ence is not very obvious.

Interaction Intensity and Frequency. For friendship,
some are close friends, and some are merely ac-
quaintances. One way to measure the
strength of
friendship is based on interaction intensity and fre-
quency (Petr´oczi, Nepusz, and Bazs´o 2007). In our system,
interaction intensity is measured by monthly total message
count between two users, denoted by mC
−30:−1(u, v) =
P−1
d=−30 md(u, v), while the interaction frequency means
the number of days two users communicated with each other
in the past one month, represented by mD
−30:−1(u, v) =

Common Friendship. Besides direct friendship,
indi-
rect
In our study,
like the phenomenon of triadic closure in social net-
work (Kossinets and Watts 2006), we only considered the
relationship with two hops5 in the OSN.

We ﬁrstly investigate the correlation between the number
of common friends between user u and v:|Fu ∩ Fu| and
interest similarity. However, we did not observe a signiﬁ-
cant relation between interest similarity and the number of
common friends. In fact, it’s more likely to have a common
friend for two users with many friends. Thus, overlap of two
users’ friend sets should be normalized by the size of each
. For most user pairs, the ratio of com-
set, i.e.,
mon friends is less than 0.25. The correlation between inter-
est similarity and the ratio of common friends is shown in
Fig. 4.

√|Fu|∗√|Fv|

|Fu∩Fv|

The results in Fig. 4 indicate that users with larger ratio of

common friends have more similar interests.
Common Group Membership. By intuition, common
group afﬁliation indicates similar interest. Hence, we exam-
ined the correlation between the number of common groups
between user u and v, i.e., |Gu ∩ Gv|, and their interest sim-
ilarity.
However, no discernable correlation can be observed be-
tween interest similarity and the number of common groups.
And even after we normalized the number of common
groups by number of groups joined by each user, we could
not observe a clear correlation yet.

4We utilized ﬁtting curves to show the trends clearly, and we
did not show functions of the curves here because we do not need
the exact functions in the interest similarity prediction.

5We did not talk about the relationship with more than two hops

because the observed interest similar was very weak.

This implies that group membership is weakly related
to the interest similarity. But it is more effective if the
membership is combined with friendship, as shown in
Fig. 5. This may result from the previous empirical obser-
vations that social relationship and interests are generically
confounded (Shalizi and Thomas 2011). Users may become
friends due to common interests, while social inﬂuence be-
tween friends may also enhance the interest conformity.

Interest Evolution Over Time

4.3
Interest Evolution. We compared the current daily tag-
based proﬁles with different previous daily proﬁles for the
same user, and the results in Fig. 6 show that users’ inter-
ests deviated more from the current ones as the time gap ex-
panded in both PTP and RTP. In general, there are three po-
tential causes of the above observations: 1) interests evolved;
2) topical trends shifted; 3) interests were partially expressed
by behaviors. The inﬂuence of the second factor could be
revealed using the RTP method. With massive data on each
day, the third factor is uniform across the tested days, and
thus won’t affect the distributions. Therefore, on the basis of
the observations under both PTP and RTP methods, we ar-
gued that there exists user interest evolution. This is also the
reason to study and predict current interest similarity. Note
that the phenomenon of interest evolution cannot be illus-
trated under the video-based interest proﬁling.

Coverage and Correlation. When there is little or no re-
cent behavioral data, an intuitive idea is to explore the past
long-term data. For users who are currently inactive, they
might have behaviors some time ago, such as in the past

one week, past one month, etc. Basically, the longer the du-
ration, the more users would have some behavior records,
i.e., higher coverage of users. According to the system mea-
surement, among the users who are active on the current
day, 27.5% of them were also active in the past one day;
around 67% of them were active in the past one week; and
more than 85% of them had some behaviors in the past one
month. However, as shown before, users’ interests evolved
with time. Interests induced from behaviors long time ago
may deviate a lot from the current interests i.e., lower corre-
lation with current interest. Therefore, we studied the corre-
lation between the current interest similarity between users
and their past similarity with different durations. Similar
to notations of social interaction, we denote interest sim-
ilarity in the past one day, past one week, and past one
−1(u, v); S P
month as S P
−7:−1(u, v);
and S P
−30:−1(u, v), respectively. The Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient between interest similarity on the cur-
rent day and that in the past duration is in Table 3.

4.4 Individuality of Interest

We propose the individuality of interest which indicates how
much a user is similar to other users on average. On the ba-
sis of formulas of cosine similarity measure in Eq. 3 and
Eq. 4, individuality is affected by three factors: 1) proba-
bility of sharing a common tag; 2). weights of the common
tags; 3). norm of the user proﬁle’s weight vector. While the
ﬁrst two factors inﬂuence the numerator of the formulas, the
third factor affects the denominator. Thus, we deﬁned the
individuality of user u as

H P (u) = Pi∈Tu
qPi∈Tu

TP

u [i] ∗ |Ui|
u [i])2 ∗ |U|
(TP

(6)

H R (u) = Pi∈Tu
qPi∈Tu

TR

u [i] ∗ |Ui|
u [i])2 ∗ |U|
(TR

(7)

For the ﬁrst factor, the probability of both two users have a
certain tag is determined by the global popularity of this tag,
namely, the number of users owning this tag (|Ui|). When
two users share a tag, the weight of this tag, i.e., TP
u [i] or
u [i] in each user’s proﬁle, decides the contribution to the
TR
numerator. |U| is used to normalize the feature.
We randomly selected one million pairs of users. Then
we compared the interest similarity between two users and
the product of their individuality values, as shown in Fig. 7.
We observed that two users with large individuality values
are more similar in general. The individuality of interest can
be used as an effective feature for similarity inference if we
know the interests of one user in a user pair.

5 Inferring Interest Similarity Between Users
The goal of this section is to infer user interest similarity
based on the observations in Sec. 4. From the empirical stud-
ies, we obtained the following insights: 1) we need to pre-
process features properly to make them more discriminative,
such as normalizing the number of common friends; 2) not
all the relations are quasi-linear, such as relations between
interaction intensity and interest similarity; 3) some features
need to be combined to make difference in inferring interest
similarity, such as membership combined with friendship.

In this section, we attempted to investigate two issues: 1)
among different machine learning models, which one is best
suited for our prediction tasks; 2) the effectiveness of differ-
ent categories of features and their combinations. To illus-
trate them, we conduct two series of experiments: 1) with all
the selected features, we ﬁt them with various algorithms to
learn different models; 2) for each feature combination, we
construct a predictive model using pruned decision tree. For
each series of experiments, we examine the performance of
interest similarity prediction in both PTP and RTP cases for
the classiﬁcation (two users are similar or not) and regres-
sion tasks (the similarity value between two users).

In total, we deﬁne 10 features belonging to three cate-

gories, namely demography, social relations and interest:

|Fu∩Fv|

−30:−1(u, v)

• Location pair: lu and lv
• Friendship: F (u, v)

• Gender pair: gu and gv
• Age pair: au and av
• Ratio of common friends:
√|Fu|∗√|Fv|
• Number of common groups: |Gu ∩ Gv|
• Monthly message count: mC
−30:−1(u, v)
• Monthly messaging days: mD
−30:−1(u, v)
• Past long-term similarity: S P
−30:−1(u, v) or S R
• Individuality: H P (u) or H R (u)
From users who were active on the target day (August
30th, 2015), we randomly selected one million user pairs
for each experiment. We used seventy percent of the sam-
ples for training and the rest as the testing data. Moreover,
ten-fold cross validation was used in model training. For the
classiﬁcation task, we binarized the similarity values with a
certain threshold (the mean value of interest similarity) so
that we could predict whether two users are similar or not.
To evaluate the performance, we utilized the evaluation met-
rics of area under the ROC curve (AUC) which is insensitive
to label imbalance. And for regression, to avoid the speciﬁc
values of regression error, we used reduced ratio of mean
absolute error (reduced ratio of MAE) as the performance
metrics which is calculated by comparing the error with that
achieved by a constant estimator using the mean value of
similarity in the training set.

5.1 Experiments of Various Machine Learning

Models

Particularly, we are interested in predicting the interest
similarity between inactive users and active users since
it’s useful
in applications, such as item recommenda-
tion (Su and Khoshgoftaar 2009) and targeted online adver-
tising (Yu and Houg 2014). Since we have the interest infor-
mation of the active user, we could utilize her interest indi-
viduality as a predictive feature6.

The next job is to select the best model to deal with these
features. Considering the heterogeneity of these features, it
is intuitive to use tree models which are non-linear mod-
els and can cope with categorical and continuous features
directly; while linear models are better at approaching the
data on the whole and ﬁtting linear or quasi-linear relations.
To capitalize on the merits of both models, we propose a hy-
brid tree-encoded linear model. In this model, we ﬁrstly used
gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) (Ye et al. 2009) to
encode the features by converting the original features into
some binary features. Each encoded feature corresponds to
a region jointly described by multiple ranges of original
feature values. As a simple example, consider a boosted
tree with two sub-trees, where the ﬁrst sub-tree has three
leaves and the second has two leaves. If an input sample
ends up in leaf two in the ﬁrst sub-tree and leaf one in sec-
ond sub-tree, then the input will be encoded as the binary

6If both users are currently inactive, then we only need to omit

the individuality feature in the prediction.

vector [0,1,0,1,0], where the ﬁrst three entries correspond
to the leaves of the ﬁrst sub-tree and last two to those of
the second sub-tree. The details of using GBDT to encode
heterogeneous features into binary features can be found
in (He et al. 2014). Furthermore, to complement the possi-
bly missed linear relations between the output and the origi-
nal features, we applied both the encoded features and orig-
inal features into a regularized linear model, i.e., logistic re-
gression with L-1 regularization for classiﬁcation and Lasso
regression for regression, to reduce redundancy among those
features.

For comparison, we used two linear models and two tree
models to ﬁt the data. The linear models consist of simple
linear models and regularized linear models, and the tree
models comprise decision tree models and ensemble tree
models. For linear models, regularization can be embed-
ded to alleviate the inﬂuence of feature dependence; while
for tree models, ensemble (Alpaydin 2014) is a state-of-the-
art approach widely used to improve the performance. In
our experiments, we utilized linear regression and logis-
tic regression as well as the l1-regularized ones of them
for the classiﬁcation and the regression, respectively. More-
over, pruned decision tree (Liu et al. 2010) and random for-
est7 (Saffari et al. 2009) were used for both classiﬁcation
and regression tasks. The performance results of different
models in similarity prediction are shown in Table 4 and Ta-
ble 5.

relations. Different from traditional ensemble tree models,
namely random forest and GBDT which assigns a weight
for each sub-tree, our hybrid tree-encoded linear model will
learn a weight for each leaf node of the sub-trees and for
each original feature.

We also applied the hybrid tree-encoded linear model to
predict video-based similarity deﬁned in Eq. 5 with our full
feature set, and compared the results with that using the tag-
based scheme as shown in Table 6. The predicted video-
based similarity will be used in Sec. 6.

5.2 Experiments of Different Feature

Combinations

To test the predictive ability of different features, we can use
seven combinations, namely, social, demographic, interest,
social + demographic, social + interest, demographic + in-
terest, and social + demographic + interest. For each combi-
nation, we utilize pruned decision tree to learn the model,
since it can capture non-linear patterns and achieve good
performance with careful pruning. The results are shown in
Table 7 and Table 8.

Under both PTP and RTP, the hybrid tree-encoded linear
model achieved the best performance in the classiﬁcation
and regression tasks, meaning that it best ﬁt our problem. In
fact, the tree-encoded features could achieve feature com-
binations automatically so as to capture the non-linear and
multi-feature (i.e., membership combined with friendship)

7The individual performance of random forest and gradient
boosting decision tree (GBDT) is almost the same, thus we only
show one of them.

In general, each category of features would contribute
to the interest similarity prediction on its own. And with

more selected features, the prediction performance is better.
Although various social relations are apparently correlated
with interest similarity as show in Sec. 4, they are not avail-
able to many user pairs. Moreover, the results show that for
user pairs with partially available information, such as, only
social and demographic information, we could still adopt the
predictive models to improve the interest similarity estima-
tion.

6 Apply Our Findings to Recommendation
To demonstrate the practical value of the proposed predic-
tion algorithms and the tag-based proﬁling scheme, we ap-
plied the predicted results to video recommendation. The
goal of this section is to recommend a list of videos match-
ing the user’s video interests, that is, top-N recommenda-
tion (Cremonesi, Koren, and Turrin 2010).

For traditional recommendation algorithms, such as CF
and content-based ﬁltering, it is difﬁcult to provide accu-
rate recommendation for users with little or no recent in-
terest information, which is known as the cold start prob-
lem (Koren, Bell, and Volinsky 2009). However, if we could
ﬁnd some currently active users who are predicted to be sim-
ilar to these inactive users, then we can recommend videos
based on active users’ interests to get over the cold start
problem. Similar to the principles of many existing solu-
tions to address the cold start problem, we try to ﬁnd clos-
est neighbors (helpers) with similar interests to recommend
items.

6.1 Experiment Settings
From our dataset, we randomly selected two thousand active
users (as ground truth) on the target day, denoted by U T .
To restrict the scope of neighbor selection without global
searching from millions of users, we randomly drew ﬁve
thousand candidate neighbors for each target user. To test
the performance of social-friend-based approach, those can-
didate neighbors also include the friends of the target user.
For fair and uniﬁed comparison, we ﬁnd top-K similar users
from the candidate neighbors of each target user for rec-
ommending N videos by selecting the top-N popular videos
among these K neighbors.

For neighbor selection in both tag-based (PTP & RTP)
and video-based proﬁling (VBP) schemes, we utilized the
similarity values predicted by the regression tasks in Sec. 5.
Then the recommendation lists are generated by aggregating
the selected neighbors’ viewing records and keeping the top-
N popular videos from those records. For comparison, we
also implemented various algorithms corresponding to dif-
ferent strategies (both personalized and non-personalized)
of closest neighbor selection. Three personalized approaches
we used are as follows.
• Demographic proﬁle similarity: select K closest neigh-
bors according to the similarity of demographic proﬁles.
• Social friend ﬁltering: select top-K close friends of the
target user based on their interaction frequency, i.e., the
monthly messaging days.

• Past long-term proﬁling: when current interest informa-
tion is unavailable, one conventional method is to uti-
lize the past long-term records. In this method, we chose
the top-K similar neighbors by comparing the past one
month’s video records of the target user and each candi-
date neighbor.

Besides, we used two non-personalized algorithms as base-
lines.
• Random: randomly select K users from the candidate
neighbors and recommend the most popular N videos
from these users to each target user.

• Global popularity: for each target user, always recom-
mend the top-N popular videos among all the ﬁve thou-
sand candidate neighbors.

6.2 Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of each algorithm, we employ
two categories of metrics that measure not only the accuracy
of recommendations, but also the diversity of the recommen-
dation results. Assume the viewed video set of user u is Iu,
and the video set recommended to user u by a certain algo-
rithm is Ru.
Accuracy. We utilize F-measure (Powers 2011) as the ac-
curacy metrics which examines whether videos viewed by
target users are ranked at top positions in the recommenda-
tion lists.

• F-measure = 2 ∗ Precisioon∗Recall

Precisioon+Recall , where Precision =

Pu∈U T |Iu∩Ru|

Pu∈U T |Ru|

; Recall =

Pu∈U T |Iu∩Ru|

Pu∈U T |Iu|

.

.

|U T |∗(|U T |−1)

2∗Pu,v∈U T |Ru∩Rv|

Diversity. Many popular algorithms were reported to have
a tendency to focus on popular items (Jannach et al. 2013),
which is not helpful for discovering users’ diverse inter-
ests. We use Diversiﬁcation as the diversity metrics which
measures the average inter-user difference of recommenda-
tion results (Zhang, Zhou, and Zhang 2010). The larger this
value, the more diverse the results are.
• Diversiﬁcation = 1 −
6.3 Experiment Results
Accuracy. Since the number of videos viewed by each
user varies, we tested the performance by different values
of N (=|Ru|). Typically, the length for the recommendation
list is in tens. Thus, our experimental study focuses on the
interval [10,100]. We ﬁrstly ﬁxed the value of K (= 15), and
varied N. The results8 are shown in Fig. 8. The reason why
the values of F-measure are relatively small is that we used
historical data to conduct the experiments. Compared with
online testing, there is an exposure bias for ofﬂine evalua-
tion, that is, online users typically select and view videos
from the list of videos exposed to them which are unknown
to ofﬂine experiments.

Furthermore, one way to illustrate how different algo-
rithms perform with regard to different number of neighbors,
i.e, K, is to assume we know the number of videos viewed

As shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, PTP and RTP could more
accurately hit users’ interests than VBP, which validated the
advantage of the tag-based scheme over the video-based pro-
ﬁling scheme. Global popularity strategy is irrelevant to K
since it consider all the candidate neighbors. Global popular-
ity based recommendation could achieve moderate perfor-
mance because it is derived from the statistics and popular
videos are just what the majority of users have viewed. Actu-
ally, recent work also showed that popularity-based methods
can represent a comparably strong baseline (Steck 2011).
Moreover, the reason why the social friend based strategy
did not perform well as expected is that there are fairly
few friends as candidates compared to other cases. In other
words, even interest similarity between friends is in general
larger than that between random users, friends may not be
the most similar users to the target users among all the users.
In Fig. 9, we found that when K is small, such as one or
two, algorthms did not perform well except for global pop-
ularity based approach. It’s because, with a small number of
neighbors, we might not have enough videos candidates for
recommendation yet.

Compared with recommendations from VBP, the results
produced by two tag-based methods are more diverse in
terms of inter-user difference. Another conclusion is that,
although, PTP is better than RTP with regard to prediction
accuracy, RTP scheme could generate more diverse results,
which is useful for discovery of the long-tail part of user
interests.

7 Related Works

With the popularity of OSNs, a better understanding of how
much two individuals are alike in their interests, namely, in-
terest similarity, will beneﬁt various applications in OSNs.
For example, information about interest similarity can be
leveraged to improve friend recommendation based on the
observation that the like-minded users are more likely to be-
come friends (Lewis, Gonzalez, and Kaufman 2012). More-
over, targeted online advertising can also beneﬁt from this
because we could largely expand the pool of potential
clients by ﬁnding users who are similar to the existing
clients (Yu and Houg 2014). In this paper, we apply the in-
ferred interest similarity to video recommendation where the
collaborative recommender systems identify users who are
similar to a target user in order to recommend items to her.
There are many studies on user interest proﬁling. Users
may express their interests explicitly in their proﬁles when
they register online, such as facebook(Han et al. 2014). Al-
ternatively, user interest models can be derived by ana-
lyzing a user’s own behaviors, which can be mainly di-
vided into three categories: 1) item-based method which
proﬁles users’ interests by consumed items, such as viewed
videos or collected books; 2) tag-based method where
user interest proﬁles can be created by either aggregat-
ing the consumed item set and the tag sets of those
items or directly taking the tags which the users have
already used. (Hung et al. 2008) proposes a user proﬁl-
ing approach based on the tags associated with one’s
personal collection of contents. (Wang, Liu, and Fan 2011)
studies how to connect people share similar interests via
a tag network. In collaborative tagging systems, such as

del.icio.us9, users can choose their own words as tags to
describe consumed items, which is also known as folkson-
omy (Cai and Li 2010); 3) latent topic-based method which
describes users’ interests by some latent topics derived
from matrix factorization (Koren, Bell, and Volinsky 2009)
or LDA (Krestel, Fankhauser, and Nejdl 2009)
from the
video consumption and description data. In this paper, we
adopt tag-based proﬁling which can alleviate the weakness

When we do not have users’ behavioral data, such as
for new users, users’ interests can only be inferred based
other user information. Recent studies start to leverage
social cues to enhance user interest modeling. Trust is
shown to be positively correlated with interest similar-
ity (Ziegler and Golbeck 2007). Besides, people tend to be-
friend others who share similar traits, known as homophily
(Lewis, Gonzalez, and Kaufman 2012).

previous work investigated how various user information
affects interest similarity based on video-based user proﬁl-
ing (Han et al. 2014). In this work, we mine and learn to
predict two users’ interest similarity with two tag-based user
proﬁling methods, namely, PTP and RTP, which are shown
to be more reasonable and effective than the traditional
video-based method.

8 Conclusion

In this paper, we mined and predicted users’ interest similar-
ity deﬁned by tag-based interest proﬁles. We ﬁrstly system-
atically study the correlation between interest similarity and
various features, including demographic (age, gender and lo-
cation), social (friendship, community membership, and in-
teraction information) and interest (past long-term similar-
ity and individuality of interest), to select the most effective
features. Then we test the effectiveness of different feature
combinations and machine learning models (including the
hybrid tree-encoded linear model proposed by us) in predict-
ing two users’ interest similarity when their recent interests
is few or blank. Furthermore, we apply our model to video
recommendation to demonstrate its practical value. In the
future work, we will try to explore and test more application
scenarios for the interest similarity prediction.
