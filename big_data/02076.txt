Abstract

We search for a continuum limit in the causal dynamical triangulation (CDT)
approach to quantum gravity by determining the change in lattice spacing using
two independent methods. The two methods yield similar results that may indi-
cate how to tune the relevant couplings in the theory in order to take a continuum
limit.

Introduction

1
Causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) deﬁne a nonperturbative approach to quantum
gravity in which spacetime is divided into a lattice of 4-dimensional Lorentzian triangles.
At ﬁrst sight this seems to suggest that CDT deﬁnes a discrete spacetime, however the
hope is that one can study spacetime on lattices of ever decreasing edge length, with
the eventual aim of investigating the properties of spacetime in the continuum limit. It
is therefore important to be able to reliably determine the lattice spacing in CDT, and
how it changes within the parameter space. In this work we calculate the lattice spacing
using two independent methods at a number of diﬀerent points in the parameter space
with the aim of gaining an insight into how one might take a continuum limit in CDT.
As is well known, gravity as a perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory is not renormaliz-
able by power-counting [1]. However, as suggested in Weinberg’s seminal work [2] the
deﬁnition of renormalizability might be generalised to the nonperturbative regime as

1

detailed by the asymptotic safety scenario [3]. The asymptotic safety scenario would be
realised if a ﬁnite number of couplings terminated at an ultra-violet ﬁxed point (UVFP),
so that the theory remains ﬁnite and predictive even in the inﬁnite energy limit. In this
way a lattice theory of gravity, such as CDT, might be used to provide evidence for
asymptotic safety by searching for a second-order critical point in its parameter space
which would correspond to an UVFP. The divergent correlation length characteristic of
a second-order critical point would allow for the possibility of taking the lattice spacing
to zero while simultaneously keeping observable quantities ﬁxed in physical units.

A deﬁning feature of CDT is the existence of a causality condition that allows one
to distinguish between space-like and time-like links on the lattice. The existence of
a causality condition allows the foliation of the lattice into space-like hypersurfaces
of ﬁxed topology. There exist two types of 4-dimensional triangulations in CDT, the
(4, 1)-simplex and the (3, 2)-simplex, where the notation (i, j) refers to the number of
vertices i on hypersurface t, and the number of vertices j on hypersurface t ± 1. In
CDT the lattice spacing of time-like links at and space-like links as are not necessarily
equal, but are related via an α parameter

(1)
For α = −1 we have at = as. By taking α (cid:54)= −1 and following Regge’s method for
describing piecewise linear geometries [4] we obtain a simple expression for the Einstein-
Hilbert action of CDT [5],

s/G and G is the bare Newton’s constant. The parameter
where κ0 is proportional to a2
∆ is related to the ratio of space-like and time-like links on the lattice, and κ4 is related
to the cosmological constant, which is ﬁxed so one can extrapolate to the inﬁnite volume
limit. We can then independently vary κ0 and ∆ in order to explore the parameter space
of CDT.

The key features of the CDT parameter space have by now been largely mapped
out.
It has been demonstrated that phase C has semiclassical features that closely
resemble 4-dimensional de Sitter space [6, 7]. The solid red line in Fig. 1 originally
thought to separate phase B from phase C appears to be a second-order transition [8],
allowing for the possibility of taking a continuum limit. However, the location of the
newly discovered bifurcation phase [9] separating phase C from phase B may prevent
the possibility of approaching the second order transition line from within the physically
interesting phase C (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, recent studies suggest the continuum
limit may exist for suﬃciently large κ0 and ∆, rather than near the B-C transition as
previously thought [10]. The aim of this work is to independently check the ﬁndings
of Ref.
[10] by determining how the lattice spacing changes as a function of the bare
parameters κ0 and ∆ using two independent methods.

2 Simulation details
We aim to reduce systematic errors associated with our measurements in two ways.
First, we aim to reduce ﬁnite size eﬀects. In Ref. [11], ﬁnite size eﬀects were shown to be

2

negligible for lattice volumes of N4,1 = 160k for the bare parameters (κ0 = 2.2, ∆ = 0.6),
(κ0 = 3.6, ∆ = 0.6), and (κ0 = 4.4, ∆ = 0.6). However, for bare parameters correspond-
ing to ﬁner lattice spacings ﬁnite-size eﬀects appeared to increase. For this reason we
simulate with a larger lattice volume N(4,1) = 300k close to the C-A transition line in
order to reduce ﬁnite size eﬀects. Secondly, the discretisation eﬀect of odd-even oscil-
lations in the short distance spectral dimension have been removed by omitting values
of DS (σ) from the ﬁt-functions wherever they become signiﬁcant as indicated in Fig.
3, typically this occurs around σ ≈ 80.
We reduce statistical errors by ensuring our conﬁgurations are thermalized. This
check is made by analysing DS (∞) as a function of Monte Carlo time and showing
there is no statistical diﬀerence between the ﬁrst and second half of the measured data
set, as detailed in Ref. [11].

The (κ0, ∆) coordinates of the points at which we simulate in this work are schemat-

ically depicted in Fig. 1.

The spectral dimension in this work is determined by taking the starting point
of diﬀusion processes to be in the time slice containing the maximal number of (4,1)
simplices, so as to ensure that we are probing the bulk geometry with each diﬀusion.
The maximal number of time steps σ in our calculations is set to 500, and the time
extension of our ensembles is t = 80. We use a linear volume ﬁxing constraint δS =
(4,1) |, with  = 0.02 after thermalization when determining the change in
|N(4,1) − N target
lattice spacing described in section 4. For technical convenience we use a quadratic
volume ﬁxing constraint δS = 
, with  = 0.00001 when determining
the lattice spacing described in section 3.1

1In order to determine the absolute lattice spacing we ﬁt the parameters of the eﬀective action as
described in section 3. This is done by analysing the inverse of the covariance matrix of spatial volume
ﬂuctuations. To get rid of the zero mode and make the matrix invertible we allow for total volume
ﬂuctuations around N target
(4,1) and subtract the eﬀect of volume ﬁxing from the eﬀective action. For the
quadratic volume ﬁxing the eﬀect is a simple shift of the inverse matrix elements by a constant 2.

3 Method 1: Fluctuations about de Sitter space
In order to perform numerical simulations one typically has to work with dimensionless
quantities by expressing all parameters in terms of the (absolute) lattice spacing aabs
and then assuming aabs = 1. As a result, in order to translate (dimensionless) numerical
results into (dimensionful) physical units one should ﬁnd a way to measure the absolute
lattice spacing. This can be achieved by looking at eﬀective observables and comparing
them to corresponding physical constants which reintroduces a scale into the numerical
system.

The method for determining the absolute lattice spacing that we shall study in this
section was ﬁrst proposed in Refs. [6, 7]. It is based on the observation that inside phase
C of the CDT parameter space, the distribution of volume as a function of time has an
expectation value that closely matches de Sitter space, and hence closely resembles a
maximally symmetric spacetime with a positive cosmological constant with 3-volume
distributed according to the universal curve [7]

N3(t) is (twice) the number of tetrahedra2 comprising each spatial slice at a (dis-
crete) time t, where the result is independent of the total lattice volume. The constant
s0 depends on the radius of the extended part of the universe (the so-called blob). At
the same time quantum ﬂuctuations δN3(t) = N3(t) − (cid:104)N3 (t)(cid:105) are consistent with the
eﬀective action [7]

where C4 is the dimensionless eﬀective volume of a unit 4-simplex, while s0 is the exten-
sion of the universe deﬁned by Eq. (3) and Γ is the amplitude of quantum ﬂuctuations
deﬁned by Eq. (4). In order to estimate s0 we make a ﬁt of Eq. (3) to the average
volume proﬁle (cid:104)N3(t)(cid:105) measured in numerical simulations. The procedure of estimat-
ing Γ is based on the analysis of the covariance matrix Ct t(cid:48) ≡ (cid:104)δN3(t)δN3(t(cid:48))(cid:105), where
δN3(t) ≡ N3(t) − (cid:104)N3(t)(cid:105), and follows the procedure described in detail in Ref.
[12].
We use the inverse of the empirical covariance matrix C−1
t t(cid:48) , whose elements are (in a
semiclassical approximation) given by second order derivatives of the eﬀective action
(4), to ﬁt the action parameters to numerical data.

We use three methods for determining aabs. Each method uses formula (9) but
diﬀers in the way C4 is determined (the measurement of s0 and Γ is universal). The
three methods are as follows (see Appendix 1 for more details):

• In method (a) we set C4 = const. (independent of the position in CDT param-
eter space). This is consistent with the assumption that spatial layers of equal
(integer) t, which are built of equilateral tetrahedra, are separated by a univer-
sal time distance of constant lattice length. As such, tetrahedra are constituents
(faces) of (4,1)-simplices, in this approach one takes into account only simplices
of this type, disregarding all (3,2)-simplices.

• In method (b) we assume: C4 = C4(ξ), where: ξ = N (3,2)/N (4,1). In Ref. [12]
it was shown that (3,2) simplices form closed layers which can be attributed a
half-integer t variable. The number of (3,2) simplices in each layer is consistent
with the volume proﬁle of (4,1)-simplices (tetrahedra) in integer t by a simple
rescaling of ξ. This method is more general than (a), as it takes into account
both (4,1) and (3,2) simplicial layers. A simpliﬁcation and approximation comes
from the fact that one assumes that all 4-simplices are symmetric and thus the
volume of each 4-simplex is constant and universal, independent of the position
in the parameter space (C41 = C32 = const.).

Table 1: A table showing aabs for 8 points (κ0, ∆) in phase C of the CDT parameter space.
The absolute lattice spacing aabs was determined by analysing ﬂuctuations about de Sitter
space using three diﬀerent methods (a), (b) and (c) described in the text. The lattice spacing
is in units of the Planck length lpl.
∗ For the last three points the method (c) breaks down, as there exist two real solutions for α
(with α < 1 and α (cid:29) 1) and thus two solutions for aabs (among the two we have chosen the
one with α < 1, which is also the case for the points where only one solution is possible - this
fact is denoted by: ∗ ).

• In method (c) we assume: C4 = C4(ξ, C41, C32), where: ξ = N (3,2)/N (4,1). This
is the most general assumption as it accounts for the fact that the volume of a
unit 4-simplex depends on the position in the bare parameter space of CDT and,
in principle, C41(α) (cid:54)= C32(α). This method requires determining the value of the
parameter α = α(κ0, ∆, κ4) which deﬁnes the asymmetry between the length of
time-like and space-like links on the lattice.

The reason for using various methods is due to the fact that we want to compare
the results of the absolute lattice spacing derived in this section with the relative lattice
spacing deﬁned by the rescaling of the spectral dimension (see Section 4), and check
which method gives the closest agreement. Additionally, method (c), which naively
seems to be the most accurate, breaks down close to the C-A phase transition (where
double valued or complex α solutions are possible).

In principle, all three parameters in formula (9): s0, Γ and C4 (in methods (b)
and (c)) depend on the actual position in the CDT bare parameter space. As a result
aabs = aabs(κ0, ∆, κ4). One can check how aabs changes by following various trajectories
in the parameter space and determining those for which aabs → 0 monotonically. The
values of aabs at each sampled point of the bare parameter space in phase C are presented
in Table 1 and Fig. 2, where we compare the absolute lattice spacing calculated using
the three diﬀerent methods described. The error bars shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2 are
related to ﬁtting errors of parameters Γ, s0 and ξ used to calculate aabs by formula (9)
and do not take into account statistical errors. The error bars clearly increase close to
the C-A phase transition which is mainly due to the increased error associated with Γ.
Γ → ∞ as one approaches the phase transition resulting in a high noise/signal ratio in
the measured inverse covariance matrix, which produces the increased error estimate.

The spectral dimension is related to the probability Pr (σ) that a random walk returns
to the origin after σ diﬀusion steps. The spectral dimension can be derived from the
d-dimensional diﬀusion equation

Kg (ζ0, ζ, σ) − gµν (cid:53)µ (cid:53)νKg (ζ0, ζ, σ) = 0,

∂

(10)

where Kg is the heat kernel deﬁning the probability density of diﬀusing between ζ0 and
ζ. (cid:53) is the covariant derivative of the metric gµν. For inﬁnitely ﬂat Euclidean space,
Eq. (10) has the solution

where d2

g (ζ, ζ0) deﬁnes the geodesic distance between ζ and ζ0.

The quantity that is measured in the numerical simulations is the probability of

return Pr (σ), which in asymptotically ﬂat space is given by

In a lattice formulation of an asymptotically safe ﬁeld theory an ultraviolet ﬁxed
point is expected to manifest as a second-order critical point. At a second-order critical
point macroscopic observables become independent of the microscopic regularisation,
and should therefore become scale invariant. A scale invariant spectral dimension would
appear as a perfectly ﬂat DS (σ) curve over all distance scales σ. Therefore, we should
expect to see progressively ﬂatter spectral dimension curves as we approach such a
ﬁxed point. The amount by which we must rescale DS (σ) at a particular point in
the parameter space such that it agrees with DS (σ) at another point in the parameter
space will then be related to the change in relative lattice spacing when transforming
between the two points, a method ﬁrst proposed in Ref. [11].

To test the validity of this method we calculate the spectral dimension for 8 diﬀerent
points in the parameter space (see Fig. 1) and compare the results with those obtained
using the independent method of calculating the absolute lattice spacing via ﬂuctuations
about de Sitter space as described in Section 3. Our results for the spectral dimension
as a function of diﬀusion time for the 8 points sampled in the parameter space are
presented in Fig. 3. Typically, we ﬁnd a small scale spectral dimension that is more
consistent with the lower bound DS (σ → 0) ∼ 3/2 (see Ref. [11] for typical error
estimates) than with DS (σ → 0) (cid:39) 2, thereby supporting the ﬁndings of Ref.
[11].
Furthermore, except for the points close to the C-A transition we ﬁnd a large scale
spectral dimension that is consistent with DS (σ → ∞) ∼ 4.

Within phase C of CDT, the ﬁt function

make a statistical comparison between the spectral dimension curves we wish to com-
pare. We calculate the standard deviation by comparing central data points for DS (σ)
at 10 diﬀerent σ values for our canonical point (κ0 = 2.2, ∆ = 0.6) with the rescaled
DS (σ) at our comparison point. To reduce discretisation eﬀects we only compare values
for which σ ≥ 100. We compare 10 evenly spaced DS (σ) values between σ = 100 and
σ = 460. We determine the corrected sample standard deviation S via

where DC
S (σ) is the spectral dimension at the canonical point (κ0 = 2.2, ∆ = 0.6) and
DS(σ) is the rescaled spectral dimension curve with which we make the comparison,
e.g. (κ0 = 3.6, ∆ = 0.6), and n is the number of compared points. Using this method
we can determine how the standard deviation S varies as a function of arel, as shown
by the black curve in Fig 5. The value of arel for which S is minimised, as indicated by
the black dashed vertical line in Fig 5, then corresponds to the value of arel for which
the curves give the best overlap.

It is important to estimate the errors associated with determining the relative lattice
spacing. To estimate this error we calculate S as a function of arel by comparing
the minimum possible values of DS (σ) allowed by the error bars with the maximum
possible values of DC
S (σ) allowed by the error bars, as shown by the red curve in Fig. 5,
which is calculated by comparing DS (σ) values at the points (κ0 = 3.6, ∆ = 0.6) and
(κ0 = 2.2, ∆ = 0.6). The diﬀerence in the values of arel for which the red and black
curves are minimised then gives an estimate of the error associated with arel. For the
points close to the C-A transition we typically ﬁnd DS (σ → ∞) < 4, and so to aid
S (σ) we constrain a ≈ 4 in the ﬁt function while still
a better comparison with DC
ensuring a good ﬁt to the data. Furthermore, for the points close to the C-A transition
we compare only the central values of DS (σ) with the central and maximal values of
S (σ), consequently the error estimate associated with arel for the points close to the
DC
C-A transition is likely to be signiﬁcantly underestimated.

2.2, ∆ = 0.6) with the rescaled curve at (κ0 = 3.6, ∆ = 0.6) as a function of arel. An
interpolating function has been used to smoothly interpolate between data points. The value
of arel for which the solid black curve is minimised yields the best overlap between the two
DS(σ) curves. The solid red curve is determined by comparing the minimum values of DS(σ)
allowed by the error bars at the point (κ0 = 3.6, ∆ = 0.6) with the maximal values of DS(σ)
allowed within error bars at the point (κ0 = 2.2, ∆ = 0.6). The diﬀerence in the minimum of
these two curves gives an estimate of the error associated with arel.

Indications of a continuum limit

5
The change in lattice spacing determined by analysing ﬂuctuations about de Sitter space
and by rescaling the spectral dimension both indicate the lattice spacing is strongly
dependent on κ0, but that it is either independent or only very weakly dependent on
∆. The results summarised in Table 2 and Fig. 6 suggest that maximising κ0 within
phase C is predominately responsible for minimising the lattice spacing. Since the
C-A transition deﬁnes the line of maximal κ0 values in Phase C, it should also then
deﬁne the set of points for which the lattice spacing is minimised for any given ∆ value.
Extrapolating the measured transition points along the C-A line over the entire ∆ range
suggests that κ0 is maximised within phase C for very large, possibly inﬁnite ∆. If this
scenario is correct it suggests one should tune the bare parameters to the C-A transition
and move in the direction of increasing ∆ in order to approach the continuum limit.4
The data presented in this work suggests the lattice spacing in phase C is minimised
when κ0 is maximised within phase C, which implies one must tune to the C-A transition
line to take a continuum limit. Conversely, the point at which κ0 is minimised within
phase C may then be a candidate for an infra-red ﬁxed point (IRFP). Based on our
current picture of the CDT parameter space (Fig. 1) such an IRFP would exist on
the transition line dividing phase C and the bifurcation phase for the minimal allowed
value of κ0. Our measurements may then be interpreted as suggesting a renormalization
group trajectory within the parameter space shown schematically in Fig. 7.

4It is unlikely that one can take a continuum limit anywhere on the C-A transition itself since it is almost certainly
ﬁrst-order [15], however it may be that the C-A transition terminates at a second-order critical point for some ∆ value,
just as it appears to do at the quadrupole point (see Fig. 1).

6 Discussion and conclusions
An UV limit is obtained by shrinking the lattice spacing a to zero while simultaneously
keeping observable quantities ﬁxed in physical units. To give physical meaning to the
process of taking an UV limit we must therefore specify the observable we are ﬁxing in
physical units. In this work we use ﬂuctuations of three-volume about de Sitter space
and the scaling of the spectral dimension as our physical observables.

Using these two independent methods we ﬁnd the lattice spacing to be strongly
dependent on κ0, but either independent or only very weakly dependent on ∆. Our
results suggest one must maximise κ0 within phase C in order to take a continuum
limit. The C-A transition line deﬁnes the set of points for which κ0 is maximised for
each ∆ value within phase C. We therefore propose that one must tune to the C-A
transition line in order to take a continuum limit. Using the same logic an IRFP may
also then exist when κ0 is minimised along the transition dividing phase C from the
bifurcation phase (see Fig. 7). If this picture is correct a unique RG trajectory would
likely follow the path indicated in Fig. 7. This picture is consistent with the ﬁnding of
Refs. [10, 11], however further study is needed to conﬁrm or refute this proposal.

The absolute lattice spacing calculated using formula (A-13) depends on the choice
of the dimensionless parameter ˜α which deﬁnes the (temporal) lattice spacing between
neighbouring spatial layers. In this work we are interested in the relative change in
lattice spacing when moving between diﬀerent points in the CDT parameter space,
a result that does not depend on the particular choice of ˜α. However, in order to
compare the absolute lattice spacing with the results obtained by using methods (b)
5/96 , i.e. equal to the
and (c) described below, we choose ˜α = 5/4, which sets C4 =
4-volume of the equilateral unit 4-simplex.

√

Method (b)
We now assume a more realistic picture, where the CDT universe is built of N(4,1)
identical (4,1) simplices and N(3,2) identical (3,2) simplices each with physical volume

Note, that for ξ = 0 (zero (3,2) simplices) one recovers the result of Method (a).
Actually, as shown in Fig. 8, ξ → 0 as one approaches the C-A phase transition, thus
close to the transition the result of Methods (a) and (b) are very similar.

Method (c)
As in method (b) we assume that the CDT universe is built of both (4,1) and (3,2)
simplices but we additionally take into account that C41 (cid:54)= C32. The volume of a 4-
simplex is a function of the asymmetry parameter α, deﬁning the ratio of the length of
