Abstract

A Markov switching asymmetric GARCH model which imposes more lever-
age eﬀect of the negative shocks is considered. The asymptotic behavior of
the second moment is investigated and an upper bound for it is calculated. A
bayesian strategy through Gibbs and griddy Gibbs sampling is used to esti-
mate the parameters. Finally we study the performance of the model by two
real data sets. We show that this model has the best in-sample ﬁt via DIC and
provides a better forecast when the negative skewness is large enough.

Keywords: Markov switching, Leverage eﬀect, Smooth transition, DIC,

Introduction

In the past four decades, dynamic ﬁnancial time series based on nonlinear models
has been a topic of interest. For ﬁnancial time series, the ARCH and GARCH model
, introduced by Engle [12] and Bollerslev [9], are surely the most popular classes of
volatility models. Hamilton and Susmel [21] introduced Markov-Switching GARCH
(MS-GARCH) by merging GARCH model with a hidden Markov chain, where each
state of the chain allows a diﬀerent GARCH behavior. Such structure exploits ad-
vantages of both, the conditional heteroscedasticity structure of GARCH models and
the time-varying speciﬁcations of hidden Markov chains which improves forecasting

of volatilities. Gray [17], Klaassen [23] and Haas, et al. [19] proposed some diﬀer-
ent variants of MS-GARCH models. For further studies on MS-GARCH models see
Abramson and Cohen [1], Ardia [4], Alemohammad et. al [2] and Bauwens et al. [7].

One restriction of the GARCH model is its symmetry to the volatility of the
past shocks. In other words, the dynamic of conditional variance in GARCH models
change only with the size of square observations. This is improved by letting the
conditional variance to be a function of size and sign of the lagged observations.
Study of such asymmetric eﬀects started by the work of Black [8], which studied the
asymmetry of the volatility to the positive and negative shocks. This consideration
is important in ﬁnancial markets as there exist more volatile in response to bad
news (negative shocks) than to good news (positive shocks) [16]. The asymmetric
GARCH model (AGARCH) which introduced by Engle [13] captures the asymmetric
eﬀects that negative shocks have more volatile than the positive ones. Some of the
main asymmetric GARCH structures which studied later on are the Exponential
GARCH (EGARCH) model by Nelson [27], GJR-GARCH model by Glosten, et
al.[15] and Threshold GARCH (TGARCH) model by Zakoian [29] which presented
in econometric literatures. The other asymmetric structures are smooth transition
models introduced by Gonzalez-Rivera [16], Medeiros and Veiga [26] and Haas et al.
[20].

In this paper, we propose a generalization of the Markov switching GARCH
model where the volatility of each regime is coupled with the smooth transition
structure. The new model obviates the absence of asymmetric property in the
Markov switching GARCH model and also the loss of transition of diﬀerent levels
of volatility in the smooth transition GARCH models. By considering diﬀerent
smooth transition models for states, the model is talent to provide a more eﬃcient
structure for modeling series with wide levels of volatilities and also encompasses the
diﬀerent leverage of eﬀects causes by positive and negative shocks in each regime.
As such model employ all past observations, forecasting structure could increase the
complexity of the model. So we reduce the volume of calculations by proposing a
dynamic programming algorithm.

We also derive necessary and suﬃcient conditions for stability and obtain an
upper bound for the limit of the second moment by using the method of Abramson
and Cohen [1] and Medeiros [26]. For the estimation of the parameters, the Bayesian
inference using Gibbs and griddy Gibbs sampling is considered.

The organization of this paper is as follows: The Markov switching smooth
transition GARCH model is presented in section 2. Section 3 is devoted to the
statistical properties of the model. Estimation of the parameters of the model are
studied in section 4. Section 5 is dedicated to the analysis of the eﬃciency of the
proposed model by applying the model to the S&P 500 and Swiss Market index for

some special periods. Section 6 concludes.

2 Markov switching smooth transition GARCH model

The Markov switching smooth transition GARCH model, MS-STGARCH, for time
series {yt} is deﬁned as

(2.1)

yt = εtpHZt,t,

where {εt} are iid standard normal variables, {Zt} is an irreducible and aperiodic
Markov chain on ﬁnite state space E = {1, 2, · · · , K} with transition probability
matrix P = ||pij||K×K, where pij = p(Zt = j|Zt−1 = i), i, j ∈ {1, · · · , K}, and
stationary probability measure π = (π1, · · · , πK)′. Also given that Zt = j, Ht,j (the
conditional variance in regime j) is driven by

Hj,t = a0j + a1jy2

t−1(1 − wj,t−1) + a2jy2

t−1wj,t−1 + bjHj,t−1,

(2.2)

and each of the weights (wt,j) is a logistic function of the past observation as

wj,t−1 =

1

1 + exp(−γjyt−1)

γj > 0, j = 1, · · · , K,

(2.3)

which are bounded, 0 < wj,t−1 < 1, and monotonically increasing. The parameter γj
is called the slope parameter. Since γj > 0, the weight function 0 < wj,t−1 < 1 goes
to zero when yt−1 → −∞ and to one when yt−1 → +∞. So a1j in each state will
characterize negative shocks and a2j positive ones. It refers to the fact that negative
and positive shocks have diﬀerent eﬀects on volatility. When γj → ∞, the logistic
function becomes a step function. For γj tending to zero, wj,t−1 goes to 1/2 and the
MS-STGARCH model tends to Markov switching GARCH model(MS-GARCH). In
the case of single regime, our model is the smooth transition GARCH (STGARCH)
model that is introduced by Lubrano [25].

It is assumed that {εt} and {Zt} are independent. Suﬃcient conditions to guar-
antee strictly positive conditional variance are a0j to be positive and a1j, a2j, bj
being nonnegative.

Let It be the observation set up to time t. The conditional density function of

yt given past information is obtained as follows:

f (yt|It−1) =

3 Statistical Properties of the model

In this section, the statistical properties of the MS-STGARCH model are investi-
gated and the conditional variance of the process is obtained. We show that the
model, under some conditions on coeﬃcients and transition probabilities , is asymp-
totically stable in the second moment. An appropriate upper bound for the limiting
value of the second moment is obtained.

3.1 Forecasting

The conditional variance of MS-STGARCH model is given by

V ar(Yt|It−1) =

K

Xi=1

α(t)
i Hi,t =

Xi=1

α(t)
i (a0i + a1iy2

t−1(1 − wi,t−1)

+ a2iy2

t−1wi,t−1 + biHi,t−1)

(3.5)

as Ht,i is the conditional variance of i-th state. This relation shows that the con-
ditional variance of this model is aﬀected by changes in regime and conditional
variance of each state.
As using all past observations for forecasting could increase the complexity of the
model, we reduce the volume of calculations by proposing a dynamic programming
algorithm. At each time t, α(t)
(in equation (2.4), (3.5)) can be obtained from a
i
dynamic programming method based on the forward recursion algorithm, proposed
in remark (3.1).

3.2 Stability

In this subsection, we investigate the stability of second moment of the MS-STGARCH
model. Similar to our previous work [2], we are looking for an upper bound of our
model for the second moment. Assume M is a positive constant and let

Ω = [a01 + |a21 − a11|M 2, · · · , a0K + |a2K − a1K|M 2)]′,

(3.7)

be a vector with K component, C denotes a K 2-by-K 2 block matrix as

matrix with elements [b1, · · · , bK ] on its diagonal.
Let Π = [π1e′

STGARCH model.

Proof 3.2 See Appendix B.

4 Estimation

For the estimation of parameters, we apply the Bayesian inference, that is extensively
used in literature ([6], [7] and [25]).

Let Yt be the vector (y1, · · · , yt). In what follows, for the case of two regimes, we
are going to estimate the Zt = (z1, · · · , zt) and the parameter vectors η = (η11, η22)
and θ = (θ1, θ2), where θk = (a0k, a1k, a2k, bk, γk) for k = 1, 2 from the posterior
density

5

p(θ, η, Z|Y ) ∝ p(θ, η)p(Z|θ, η)f (Y |θ, η, Z),

(4.10)

in which Y = (y1, · · · , yT ), Z = (z1, · · · , zT ) and p(θ, η) is the prior of the parame-
ters. The conditional probability mass function of Z given the (θ, η) is independent
of θ, so

p(Z|θ, η) =p(Z|η00, η11)

11 (1 − p11)n10 ,

(4.11)

where nij = #{zt = j|zt−1 = i} (the number of transitions from regime i to regime j).
The conditional density function of Y given the realization of Z and the parameters
is factorized in the following way:

f (Y |η, θ, Z) =

T

Yt=1

f (yt|θ, zt = k, Yt−1),

k = 1, 2,

(4.12)

exp(−

).

(4.13)

p2πHk,t

Since the straight sampling from the posterior density (4.10) is not possible, we

apply the Gibbs sampling algorithm with three blocks: θ, η and Z.
A brief description of the Gibbs algorithm: Suppose the superscript (r) on a pa-
rameter is a sample of the parameter at the r-th iteration of the algorithm. At any
iteration of the algorithm, three steps will be done:
(i) Draw the random sample of the state variable Z (r) given , η(r−1), θ(r−1).
(ii) Draw the random sample of the transition probabilities η(r) given Z (r).
(iii) Draw the random sample of the θ(r) given Z (r) and η(r).

These steps are repeated until the convergency is obtained. In what follows the

sampling of each block are explained.

4.1 Sampling zt

This step is devoted to the sampling of p(zt|η, θ, Yt) that is performed by Chib[10],
(see also [22]). Suppose p(z1|η, θ, Y0, ) be the stationary distribution of the chain,

6

p(zt|η, θ, Yt) ∝ f (yt|θ, zt = k, Yt−1)p(zt|η, θ, Yt−1),

(4.14)

where the predictive density f (yt|θ, zt = k, Yt−1) is calculated by the relation (4.13)
and by the law of total probability p(zt|η, θ, Yt−1) is given by:

p(zt|η, θ, Yt−1) =

K

Xzt−1=1

p(zt−1|η, θ, Yt−1)ηzt−1zt.

(4.15)

Given the ﬁlter probabilities (p(zt|η, θ, Yt)), we run a backward algorithm, start-
ing from t = T that zT is derived from p(zT |η, θ, Y ). For t = T − 1, · · · , 0 the sample
is derived from p(zt|zt+1, · · · , zT , θ, η, Y ),which is obtained by

p(zt|zt+1, · · · , zT , θ, η, Y ) ∝ p(zt|η, θ, Yt)ηzt,zt+1.

To derive zt from p(zt|.) = pzt is by sampling from the conditional probabilities
qj = p(Zt = j|Zt ≥ j, .) which are given by

p(Zt = j|Zt ≥ j, .) =

pj
l=j ql

.

PK

After generating a uniform (0,1) number U , if U ≤ qj then zt = j, otherwise increase
j to j + 1 and generate another uniform (0,1) and compare it by qj+1.

4.2 Sampling η

This stage is devoted to sample η = (η11, η22) from the posterior probability p(η|θ, Yt, Zt)
that is independent of Yt, θ. We consider independent beta prior density for each of
η11 and η22. For example,

p(η11|Zt) ∝ p(η11)p(Zt|η11) = ηc11+n11−1

11

(1 − η11)c12+n12−1,

where c11 and c12 are the parameters of beta prior, nij is the number of transition
from zt−1 = i to zt = j. In the same way the sample of η22 is obtained.

4.3 Sampling θ

The posterior density of θ given the prior p(θ) is given by:

p(θ|Y, Z, η) ∝ p(θ)

T

Yt=1

f (yt|θ, zt = k, Yt−1) = p(θ)

Yt=1

exp(−

p2πHk,t

which is independent of η. To sample from the p(θ|Y, Z, η) we use the Griddy Gibbs
algorithm that introduced by Ritter and Tanner [28]. This method is very applicable

7

in researches (for example [5] , [6] and [7]). Given samples at iteration r the Griddy
Gibbs at iteration r + 1 proceeds as follows:

1. Select a grid of points, such as a1

tional posterior density function k(a0i|Zt,Yt,θ−a0i
vector Gk = (k1, · · · , kG).
2. By a deterministic integration rule using the G points, compute GΦ = (0, Φ2, · · · , ΦG)

5 Two sets of empirical data

In this section we apply the daily log returns of the S&P 500 and Swiss Market
Index (SMI). The sample period of S&P 500 is from 03/01/2005 to 03/11/2014 (2500
observations), the ﬁrst 2000 observations are employed to estimate the parameters
while the remaining 500 are used in a forecasting analysis. The selected interval of
SMI is from 10/02/2004 to 11/11/2015 (3000 observations), the ﬁrst 2500 indexes
are used to estimate and the rest of them for forecasting. Figure 1 demonstrates the
percentage returns of 1 of the S&P 500 and SMI. In Table 1, we report summary
descriptive statistics of returns. We observe the means are close to zero and also a
slightly negative skewness and a common excess kurtosis for each data set.

5.1 Estimation

Using the Bayesian inference, we estimate the parameters of STGARCH [25], two-
state MS-GARCH [19] and MS-STGARCH with two regimes. The prior density of
η11 and η22 (the transition probability from one regime to other regime) are drawn
from the beta distribution and the others are assumed to be uniform over a ﬁnite
intervals. The number of iterations of Gibbs algorithm for each model is 10000
which half of them are burn-in-phase. The posterior means and standard deviations

1Percentage return is deﬁned as rt = 100 ∗ log( Pt
Pt−1

), where Pt is the index level at time t.

8

for the models corresponding to S&P 500 and SMI are reported in Table 2 and
Table 3 show that the standard deviations are small enough in most cases. The
single-regime me STGARCH has diﬀerent reactions to negative and positive shocks
aren’t ﬂexible like Markov switching model to transit between low volatility and
high volatility and reverse. According to results we ﬁnd that in the MS-GARCH
and MS-STGARCH models the second regimes have higher volatility. MS-GARCH
deﬁned by setting α2j and γj, j = 1, 2 equal to zero in relation (2.2) that implies a
symmetric response respect to positive and negative shocks of the same magnitude.
The MS-STGARCH encompasses two previlages: the transition between low and
high volatility states and the diﬀerent reactions to positive and negative shocks.
Since in the MS-STGARCH, a11 > a21 and a12 > a22 and according to structure of
wj,t−1 (2.3) we deduce that the negative shocks have more aﬀect on volatility than
the positive shocks in two regimes. The obvious diﬀerences between γ1 and γ2 in
Table 2 and 3 expresses that the leverage eﬀect in each regime is diﬀerent. In all cases
the posterior means of transition probability (η11 and η22) indicate scarce mixing
between regimes. Smoothed probabilities for the second regimes of MS-STGARCH
according to S&P 500 and SMI log returns are plotted in Figure 2.

5.2 Deviance information criterion

In order to evaluate the goodness of ﬁt of models, we apply the deviance informa-
tion criterion introduced by Spiegelhalter et al. see also [14]. The smallest DIC
determines the best ﬁtting model.
In the Markov-switching models, the likelihood is calculated by the following for-
mula:

f (Y |Θ) =

f (yt|It−1, Θ)

T

Yt=1

in which Θ is the vector of all parameters in model and f (yt|It−1) is obtained from
(2.4). The deviance information criterion is computed as:

DIC = 2 log(f (Y | ˆΘ)) − 4EY |Θ[log(f (Y |Θ))],

(5.18)

that ˆΘ is the posterior means of the vector Θ. The results concerning DIC are
reported in Table 4. It is apparent that the DIC of MS-STGARCH is the smallest
value in both data sets.

5.3 Forecasting performance

For appraising the MS-STGARCH model to forecast the future treatment, we survey
the one-day-ahead value at risk (VaR) forecasts. The one-day-ahead VaR at risk

9

level α ∈ (0, 1), VaR(α) is obtained by calculating the (1 − α)th percentile of the
one-day-ahead predictive distribution [4]. Based on the last 500 returns (of S&P 500
and SMI),the out of sample VaR measures for each model are calculated. To test
the VaR values, we investigate the random sequence {vt(α)} that

Vt(α) = (cid:26) I{yt+1 < V aR(α)} if α > 0.5

I{yt+1 > V aR(α)} if α ≤ 0.5.

The out-of-sample VaR measures has the good performance if {vt(α)} is an inde-
pendent and also follows the bellow distribution (unconditional coverage):

Vt(α) ∼ (cid:26) Bernoulli(1 − α)

Bernoulli(α)

if α > 0.5
if α ≤ 0.5,

The statistics for the independency (LRind) and unconditional coverage (LRuc)
asymptotically are Chi-squared distributed with one degree of freedom. By adding
the LRind and LRuc, a dual test that inquires both hypotheses (independency and
unconditional coverage), i.e. conditional coverage (see [11] and [4]):

LRcc = LRind + LRuc,

LRcc is χ2 distributed with two degrees of freedom. The lower value of LRcc than
the critical χ2 distribution means that the correct conditional coverage and as a
result the good VaR forecasts.

The results of the tests are reported in Table 5 for S&P 500 and Table 6 for SMI.
The second and third columns demonstrate the theoritical expected violations and
the number of empirical violations. The LRind statistics in Table 5 and 6 are smaller
than critical χ2 distribution for all cases and so independency test isn’t rejected. The
results of Table 5 show that the real number of violations for the MS-STGARCH are
closer to expected values than for the STGARCH and MS-GARCH except for α =
0.99, which can be considered as a better performance. At the 10% signiﬁcance level,
the LRuc test is rejected three times for the STGARCH, two times for MS-GARCH
and is accepted for all quantities of α for the MS-STGARCH. Also the values of
LRcc are lower than the critical χ2 distribution for MS-STGARCH, while this test
are rejected three times for the STGARCH and one time for the MS-GARCH. In
Table 6 the LRuc is larger than critical value three times for STGARCH and two
times for the MS-GARCH and MS-STGARCH. Also the conditional coverage test
is rejected thrice for the STGARCH, once for the MS-GARCH and twice for the
MS-STGARCH. The results indicate that the new model has the better forecasting
performance than the STGARCH model in both examples. In the case of greater
negative skewness (S&P 500 returns), the out-of-sample VaR forecasts of the MS-
STGARCH has better performance than the MS-GARCH.

6 Conclusion

The MS-STGARCH model extend the MS-GARCH model by considering the dif-
ferent smooth transition structures in each regime. It is also an extension of the
STGARCH model that transits between the diﬀerent levels of volatilities. The pro-
posed model authorizes for greater ﬂexibility to capture volatility clustering and
leverage eﬀect that are usual patterns in ﬁnancial time series. For the estimation
of parameters we apply the Bayesian estimation algorithm. We present a simple
necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of an upper bound for the sec-
ond moment. For the estimation of the parameters the Bayesian inference is used
by applying the Griddy Gibbs algorithm. We ﬁt STGARCH, MS-GARCH and
MS-STGARCH models to the S&P 500 and SMI log returns. We demonstrate that
when the negative skewness coeﬃcient is large enough our model has the best VaR
forecasts among other models.

This model has the potential to be applied for modeling and forecasting con-
ditional volatility of ﬁnancial time series . Further researches could be oriented to
investigate the existence of the third and the fourth moments of the process and de-
rive the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for stationarity and ergodicity properties
of the process. For the sake of simplicity it was assumed that the process conditional
mean is zero, this assumption could be relaxed by reﬁning the structure of model
to allow ARMA structure for conditional mean. Finally it might be interesting to
replace the Gaussian distribution with t-distribution and investigate the ability for
modeling heavy tailed property of ﬁnancial time series.

As the hidden variables {Zt}t≥1 have Markov structure in MS-STARCH model,
so

P (Zt = j, Zt−1 = m|It−1)

p(Zt = j|Zt−1 = m, It−1)p(Zt−1 = m|It−1)

p(Zt = j|Zt−1 = m)p(Zt−1 = m|It−1)

Appendix B

Proof of Theorem 3.1.
The second moment of the model can be calculated as:

E(y2

t ) = E(HZt,t) = EZt[Et−1(HZt,t|zt)]

=

K

Xzt=1

πztEt−1(HZt,t|zt).

(6.20)

Et(.) denotes the expectation with respect to the information up to time t. Also
for summarization, we shall use E(.|zt) and p(.|zt) to represent E(.|Zt = zt) and
P (.|Zt = zt), respectively, where zt is the realization of the state at time t. The

14

conditional variance under the chain state, m, is investigated as follows:

Et−1(Hm,t|zt) =Et−1(a0m + a1my2
+ a1mEt−1[y2

= a0m

t−1(1 − wm,t−1) + a2my2

where SIt−1 is the support of It−1 = (y1, · · · , yt−1).
Upper bound for III in (6.21): Let 0 < M < ∞ be a constant, so

Et−1[y2

t−1wm,t−1|zt] =Et−1[y2

t−1wm,t−1I|yt−1|<M |zt]

+ Et−1[y2

t−1wm,t−1I|yt−1|≥M |zt]

in which

Ix<a = (cid:26) 1 if x < a

0 otherwise.

As by (2.3), 0 < wm,t−1 < 1 and so

Et−1[y2

t−1wm,t−1|zt] ≤ M 2 + Et−1[y2

t−1wm,t−1I|yt−1|≥M |zt],

lim

wm,t−1 = 1

lim

yt−1→−∞

wm,t−1 = 0,

(6.23)

therefore according to the deﬁnition of limit at inﬁnity, for a small number δ > 0,
there will exist a ﬁnite constant M > 0 such that if yt−1 ≥ M , |wm,t−1 − 1| ≤ δ and
if yt−1 ≤ −M , |wm,t−1| ≤ δ. Hence

Et−1[y2

Since the distribution of the {εt} is symmetric, then

δZSIt−2 ,yt−1≤−M

t−1p(It−1|zt)dIt−1 ≤δZSIt−2 ,−∞<yt−1<0

By replacing the obtained upper bounds and relations (6.22) in (6.21), the upper

bound for Et−1(Hm,t|zt) is obtained by:

Let At(j, k) = Et−1[Hj,t|Zt = k], At = [At(1, 1), At(2, 1), · · · , At(K, 1), At(1, 2), · · · ,

At(K, K)] be a K 2-by-1 vector and consider ˙Ω = (Ω′, · · · , Ω′)′ be a vector that is
made of K vector Ω. By (3.7)-(3.9), the following recursive inequality is attained,

At ≤ ˙Ω + CAt−1,

t ≥ 0.

(6.26)

with some initial conditions A−1. The relation (6.26) implies that

At ≤ ˙Ω

C i + C tA0 := Bt.

t−1

Xi=0

(6.27)
Following the matrix convergence theorem [24], the necessary condition for the con-
vergence of Bt when t → ∞ is that ρ(C) < 1. Under this condition, C t converges to
i=0 C i converges to (I − C)−1 provided that matrix

zero as t goes to inﬁnity and Pt−1

(I − C) is invertible. So if ρ(C) < 1,

At ≤ (I − C)−1 ˙Ω.

lim
t→∞

By (6.20) the upper bound for the asymptotic behavior of unconditional variance is
given by

limt→∞E(y2

t ) ≤ Π′(I − C)−1 ˙Ω.
