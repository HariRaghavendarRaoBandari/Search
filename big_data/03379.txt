Tracking the “real” trajectory of a quantum particle is one of the interpretation problem and it is
expressed by the Brownian (stochastic) motion suggested by E. Nelson. Especially the dynamics of
a radiating electron, namely, “radiation reaction” which requires us to track its trajectory becomes
important in the high-intensity ﬁeld physics by PW-class lasers at present. It has been normally
treated by the Furry picture in non-linear QED, but it is diﬃcult to draw the real trajectory of a
quantum particle. For the improvement of this, I propose the representation of a stochastic particle
interacting with ﬁelds and show the way to describe radiation reaction on its Brownian motion.

When we draw “real” trajectory of a particle under
the quantum ﬂuctuation, the stochastic quantization pro-
posed by E. Nelson is the candidate of the method for
it. He assumed the Brownian motion as quantum ﬂuc-
tuation and he also demonstrated not only his approach
is essentially equivalent to the Schr¨odinger equation, but
answered why the square of the wave function is regarded
as the probability density [1, 2]. However when we con-
sider the coupled system between a stochastic particle
and ﬁelds, this treatment is not obviously. Therefore,
the expression of the ﬁeld generated from the current of
a stochastic particle is interesting.

Anyway on the recent research programs by 10PW-
class lasers [3–5], it is predicted the non-linear QED ef-
fects under these high-intensity laser ﬁelds [6]. As a basic
interest of them, “radiation reaction” acting on a radi-
ating electron is regarded as the feedback eﬀect of non-
linear QED radiation [7, 8] via the Furry picture [6, 9].
Though the Furry picture can describe the propagator
of the Dirac particle absorbing photons non-linearly in a
high-intensity ﬁeld, but QED radiation in this method is
treated as the lowest order of its photon emission [10–13].
Since we may ﬁnd more higher order interactions in the
real experiments, the possibility of the non-linear and
non-perturbative regime which the Furry picture can’t
address to should not be disregarded. On the other
hand, the model of radiation reaction derived by P. A.
M. Dirac is named the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac (LAD)
equation in classical dynamics [14], but non-linear and
non-perturbative equation.

Here, τ0 = e2/6πε0m0c3 = O(10−25sec) [15] . When
we discover the direct way to the quantization from this
LAD equation, there is the possibility which improves the
non-linear and non-pertubative methods. For this pur-
pose, we discuss a possibility of stochastic quantization
of radiation reaction under the meaning of Nelson.
In

this paper, we discuss a single Klein-Gordon particle in-
teracting with ﬁelds. The contents are the kinematics of
the Klein-Gordon particle including the deﬁnition of its
proper time, the Lagrangian as the full dynamics of this
system and the derivation of radiation reaction in this
framework. A similar dynamics of the LAD equation (1)
on its Brownian trajectory can be found.

The ﬁrst part is the kinematics of a Klein-Gordon par-
ticle. For describing it, we can’t avoid considering the
probability space (Ω , A , P) for the quantum ﬂuctua-
tion. Here, A is the σ-algebra generated from a certain
non-empty set Ω which is the collection of the label of
stochastic (Brownian) paths [16]. P is the probability
measure deﬁned on Ω . Then, we also need to deﬁne the
trajectory itself. The trajectory what we want to analyze
is, namely, ˆx : T × Ω → A4(V4
M, g). Here T = R∪{±∞}
represents the parameter of time [17] and A4(V4
M, g) is
the 4-dimensional metric aﬃne space as the spacetime
itself with the 4-dimensional standard vector space V4
M
and the Minkowski metric g [18]. I also use the symbol
A4 as the aﬃne space excluding the structure of metric
g. The evolution of stochastic trajectories should be as-
sumed as the continuous semi-martingales [1, 2, 19, 20].
Under this construction of a certain stochastic process
ˆx(τ ), we consider how to analyze this time evolution.
Due to the quantum ﬂuctuation, the both categories of
the time-forward and the time-backward evolution have
to be considered. In other words, one is the (time) in-
creasing family ”Past” = {Pτ|τ ∈ T} for the time-
forward evolution and the another is the decreasing fam-
ily ”Future” = {Fτ|τ ∈ T} for the time-backwarding
[1, 2, 19]. Let’s consider Pτ is the condition from the
past to the present time τ and Fτ for one from the future
to the present. Under these structures, we can consider
the kinematics of the Brownian particle by using Pτ -
measurable and Fτ -measurable function ˆx(τ ) under the
deﬁnition of the Itˆo (stochastic) integral [21].

Here, λ =p/m0 represents the amplitude of the Brow-
nian motion [22]. The Brownian ﬂuctuation is charac-
terized by the the standard Wiener process W±(τ ) sat-
isfying E[dW µ
−(τ )|Fτ ] = 0 [23].
Especially in the case of standard Wiener process, the
following Itˆo rules are satisﬁed [24];
dτ · dτ = 0, dτ · dW µ
dW µ

+(τ )|Pτ ] = 0 and E[dW µ

±(τ ) = 0,
±(τ ) = ∓gµνdτ.

±(τ ) · dW ν

(3)

Moreover we also deﬁne the white noise ˆξµ
±(τ ) as the
time derivatives of W±(τ ) [25]. Via this introduction and
putting the new symbols d± ˆxµ(τ ) as the RHS in Eq.(2),
Eq.(2) can be recognized as the summation of the drift
velocity and the randomness ˆξµ

±(τ ) = dW µ

±/dτ (τ ),

Here the metric is chosen as g = diag(+1,−1,−1,−1).
So this is the new invariant parameter for the deﬁnition
of “the proper time” of a stochastic particle;

It requires us to consider the stochastic paths should be
the patch-works under the path-class ΓT = {γτ|τ ∈ T}
for the deﬁnition of dτ . In order to realize this kinematics
Eq.(2) or Eq.(4), we need to investigate the behavior of
the complex vector V µ(ˆx(τ )).

duces the Itˆo lemma [21] as the method of the directional

Especially by limiting the path ˆxµ(τ ) on γτ ⊆ Pτ ∩ Fτ
as the “present” τ , the superposition of the above “±”
evolution is introduced. Nottale suggested the following
complex diﬀerential and the velocity are essential man-
ners for the dynamics [22].

Here, the measure µA4 on A4 denotes dµA4 = d4x.
We construct the quantized system from Eq.(13). At
ﬁrst we don’t touch the part of the ﬁeld propagation,

particle Lagrangian interacting with the ﬁeld(s) satis-
ﬁes L0(τ, x,V+,V−) = L(τ, x,V) [22], however, let’s con-
sider L0(τ, x,V+,V−) = L(τ, x,V,V ∗) as the expansion
of it. V ∗ is the complex conjugate of V. Corresponding
to Eq.(13), I propose the following new action integral

The ﬁnal topics in this paper is the “radiation reac-
tion” eﬀects as the solution of the Maxwell equation (16)
at the point of a stochastic particle. From here, we con-
sider how to derive the ﬁeld strength tensor as the mimic
of classical dynamics like Ref.[14, 27]. Considering the
Green function ∂µ∂µG(±)(x − x′) = δ4(x − x′) under the
Lorentz condition ∂νAν

(20)
Where, G(±)(∆x) = θ(±∆x0)/2π × δ(∆xµ∆xµ) with
∆xµ = xµ − x′µ and “+/−” represents the re-
tarded/advanced Green function. By following Ref.[27],
the ﬁeld strength becomes,

(21)

Here δxµ = x − ˆxµ(τ ′) and the treatment of ∂αG(±)(δx)
with the stochastic valued index δx is not trivial. We
want to assume s2 ≡ δxµδxµ|x=ˆxµ(τ ) ∼ c2 × (τ − τ ′)2
for it, under the small time duration τ − τ ′. In the fact,
that condition can be found under the limited path-class.
The Itˆo integral is introduced at Eq.(2). By observ-
ing a certain stochastic path ˆx, the evolution d+ ˆxµ(τ )
and d− ˆxµ(τ ) should be automatically deﬁned at time τ .
When we considered the path-class

Γ

[τ,τ ′] = {γ˜τ|γ˜τ ⊂ P˜τ ∩ F˜τ , ˜τ ∈ [τ ′, τ ]} ⊂ ΓT ,

(22)

then the proper time was realized on the stochastic par-
ticle in the domain of [τ ′, τ ]. Since the Itˆo integral on it

ˆxµ(τ )− ˆxµ(τ ′) is described by using both of the evolution,
d+ ˆxµ/dτ and d− ˆxµ/dτ under the Γ
[τ,τ ′]-class. We have
known the fact c2dτ 2 = E[ ˆd∗ ˆxµ(τ )|γτ ] · E[ ˆdˆxν (τ )|γτ ] as
the deﬁnition of the proper time at Eq.(12). The length of
the world line cdτ is equal to the small distance between
the two point d√s2. Therefore expanding this naive idea,
s2 = δxµδxµ|x=ˆxµ(τ ) satisﬁes with

s2 = E(cid:20)ˆ τ

under the condition of the small time duration |τ − τ ′|.
Here our hope s2 ∼ c2 × (τ − τ ′)2 was realized on the
[τ,τ ′]-class path. Therefore, s2 = E[δxµ] · E[δxµ] is de-
ﬁned dauntlessly reﬂecting Eq.(24) when |τ − τ ′| is too
small. This expansion leads the useful relation via the fol-
lowing Nelson’s partial integration formula [1, 2, 19, 20];

is satisﬁed strictly. The rest treatments are completely
same as the method provided by F. V. Hartemann [27] ex-
cluding the directions of the stochastic evolution. Again,
there are two Itˆo integrals. The each of evolution can
be applied to the method by Hartemann. Operating this
manner, the following two radiation ﬁelds at the point of
a particle, namely the LAD-radiation ﬁelds are derived.

We discussed the formulation of radiation reaction on
a Brownian trajectory. For the realization of it, the kine-
matics was limited under the path-class ΓT = {γτ|γτ ⊆
Pτ ∩ Fτ , τ ∈ T} at ﬁrst. The proper time [Eq.(12)] and
the new Lagrangians [Eq.(14, 19)] were deﬁned on the
ΓT -class path. Then, these deﬁned Lagrangians implied
the dynamics of Scalar QED [Eq.(15, 16)]. Finally, the
Maxwell equation with the current of a stochastic par-
ticle was solved as the radiation ﬁeld [Eq.(31)] and the
expression of the equation of a radiating stochastic parti-
cle’s motion was derived [Eq.(32)]. The expected future
works should be the check of this idea with ordinal QED
form [6]. For example, the probability space (Ω , A , P)
was deﬁned with the probability measure P, however I
couldn’t touch the detail of it in this article. From the
mathematical research, it is expressed by the Onsager-
Machlup functional [30–32]. It is expected this choice of
the probability measure is equivalent to the method by G.

Parisi and Y. S. Wu [33]. On the other hand being more
realistic for the experiments, comparing Eq.(32) and the
orders of Feynman diagrams must be the concrete in-
terests of high-intensity ﬁeld physics driven by PW-class
lasers. The numerical simulations are required to investi-
gate these researches, too. Moreover, it can describe the
time evolution of a radiating quantum particle. When
we can apply it to material science, we may realize the
new simulation method.
