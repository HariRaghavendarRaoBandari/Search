FINITE TYPE MODULES AND BETHE ANSATZ

FOR QUANTUM TOROIDAL gl1

B. FEIGIN, M. JIMBO, T. MIWA AND E. MUKHIN

Abstract. We study highest weight representations of the Borel subalgebra of the quantum
toroidal gl1 algebra with ﬁnite-dimensional weight spaces.
In particular, we develop the q-
character theory for such modules. We introduce and study the subcategory of ‘ﬁnite type’
modules. By deﬁnition, a module over the Borel subalgebra is ﬁnite type if the Cartan like
current ψ+(z) has a ﬁnite number of eigenvalues, even though the module itself can be inﬁnite
dimensional.

We use our results to diagonalize the transfer matrix TV,W (u; p) analogous to those of the
six vertex model. In our setting TV,W (u; p) acts in a tensor product W of Fock spaces and
V is a highest weight module over the Borel subalgebra of quantum toroidal gl1 with ﬁnite-
dimensional weight spaces. Namely we show that for a special choice of ﬁnite type modules
V the corresponding transfer matrices, Q(u; p) and T(u; p), are polynomials in u and satisfy a
two-term T Q relation. We use this relation to prove the Bethe Ansatz equation for the zeroes
of the eigenvalues of Q(u; p). Then we show that the eigenvalues of TV,W (u; p) are given by an
appropriate substitution of eigenvalues of Q(u; p) into the q-character of V .

1. Introduction

The six vertex model is a well known representative example of quantum integrable systems.

Its integrability is attributed to a large symmetry under the quantum loop algebra Uqfsl2. This
setting easily generalizes to an arbitrary simple Lie algebra g; with each choice of Uqeg and its
representation, an analog of the six vertex model is deﬁned. Algebra Uqeg is a quantization of

the algebra of loops g[x±1] with values in g. We may then na¨ıvely ask the following question:
what if we replace the loop algebra in one variable g[x±1] with that of two variables g[x±1, y±1]?
Quantum version of loop algebras in two variables are the quantum toroidal algebras, intro-
duced by Ginzburg, Kapranov and Vasserot [GKV]. The last decade has seen novel develop-
ments in connection with geometric representation theory and gauge theory, and there are now
revived interests in this subject, see e.g. [FHHSY], [AFS], [MO], [NPS].

In this article we are concerned with the quantum toroidal algebra of type gl1. We denote it
by E. Algebra E has a universal R matrix, which allows us to consider a family of commuting
transfer matrices TV,W (u; p) analogous to those of the six vertex model T6v(u; p). Here u is a
‘spectral parameter’, p is a ‘twist parameter’, V denotes the ‘auxiliary space’, and W denotes
the ‘quantum space’ on which the transfer matrices act.

In the original six vertex model, transfer matrices are operators derived from an auxiliary
space V = C2, which act on the quantum space W = (C2)⊗N . All C2 are considered as

two dimensional representations of Uq(fsl2). In the case of the quantum toroidal algebra, the

quantum space W is an N fold tensor product of Fock spaces F(v)⊗N . The Fock module F(v)
is an inﬁnite dimensional space which has a basis labeled by all partitions. The auxiliary space

V is any highest weight representation of the Borel subalgebra of quantum toroidal gl1 with
ﬁnite-dimensional weight spaces.

Besides the intrinsic interest on its own, this problem has a close connection to a topic in
conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT). In a seminal series of papers [BLZ1]–[BLZ3] Bazhanov, Lukyanov
and Zamolodchikov introduced and studied a commutative subalgebra inside the enveloping
algebra of the Virasoro algebra. This subalgebra gives commuting operators called integrals of
motion (IM), which act on Virasoro Verma modules. Dorey and Tateo [DT] and Bazhanov et
al. [BLZ4] discovered a remarkable connection between the spectra of the Q operators, which
are certain generating functions of IM, and spectral determinants of a certain family of one-
dimensional Schr¨odinger operators. Subsequently a q analog of IM was considered by Kojima,
Shiraishi, Watanabe and one of the present authors [FKSW]. They introduced a family of
operators In, n = 1, 2, · · · , in terms of contour integrals involving currents of the deformed
Virasoro algebra, and showed their commutativity by direct computation. As it turns out,
their ﬁrst Hamiltonian I1 is obtained from the transfer matrix TF,W (u; p), where F = F(1), for
the algebra E by taking the ﬁrst term in the expansion as u → 0. Thus it is natural to expect
that the six vertex type model associated with E gives the same integrable system deﬁned by
the q-deformed IM of [FKSW]. In the limit to CFT, Litvinov [L] put forward a conjectural
Bethe Ansatz equation which describes the spectrum of this system.

In our previous work [FJMM2], we showed that the eigenvalues of I1 are indeed given in
terms of the sum of the Bethe roots. In this paper we use a method diﬀerent from the one
in [FJMM2], and obtain the spectrum of the transfer matrix TF,W (u; p), and more generally
TV,W (u; p), in full. Namely we adopt Baxter’s method of T Q relation [Ba], which we recall here.
In the case of the six vertex model, the transfer matrix T6v(u; p) with a suitable normalization
is a polynomial in the spectral parameter u. Baxter showed that there is another matrix
Q6v(u; p), which depends polynomially in u, commutes with T6v(u; p), and satisﬁes the relation

T6v(u; p)Q6v(u; p) = a(u)Q6v(q−2u; p) + p d(u)Q6v(q2u; p) ,

where a(u) and d(u) are known scalar polynomials. This relation can be viewed as the one
obeyed by eigenvalues of T6v(u; p) and Q6v(u; p). Denote the eigenvalues by the same letters.
Then the T Q relation implies the Bethe equation 0 = a(ζi)Q6v(q−2ζi; p) + p d(ζi)Q6v(q2ζi; p) for
the roots {ζi} of Q6v(u; p). Once Q6v(u; p) is known, the corresponding eigenvalue T6v(u; p) is
given in turn as

T6v(u; p) = a(u)

Q6v(q−2u; p)

Q6v(u; p)

(1 + a6v(u; p)) ,

a6v(u; p) = p

d(u)
a(u)

Q6v(q2u; p)
Q6v(q−2u; p)

.

and a new, auxiliary matrix T(u; p) diﬀerent from TF,W (u; p). The relation takes the form

Unlike the case of Uqfsl2, the T Q relation in the toroidal case is written in terms of Q(u; p)

(1.1)

T(u; p)Q(u; p) = a(u)

where qs (s = 1, 2, 3) are the parameters of the algebra E satisfying q1q2q3 = 1. The original
transfer matrix TF,W (u; p) is then given by an inﬁnite series

TF,W (u; p) =

Theorem 5.8 below. Construction of Q(u; p) and T(u; p), and formula (1.2) for the transfer
matrix eigenvalues, are the main results of this paper.

Our approach is based on representation theory. Bazhanov et al.

[BLZ3] showed that the
matrix Q6v(u; p) is a transfer matrix of an appropriate representation of the Borel subalgebra

of Uqfsl2. Frenkel and Hernandez [FH] generalized this construction to an arbitrary quantum
loop algebra Uqeg of non-twisted type, and obtained an expression of the transfer matrix in

terms of appropriate analogs of Q6v(u; p).
In the present article, we construct the operator
Q(u; p) in the setting of the quantum toroidal algebra E. We are able to add the next step: we
also construct an operator T(u; p) which satisﬁes the two-term T Q relation (1.1), and therefore
prove the Bethe equation for the zeroes of the eigenvalues of Q(u; p), see Theorem 5.8.

Our construction is based on the study of inﬁnite dimensional modules of the Borel subalgebra
on which the Cartan like generator ψ+(z) has a ﬁnite number k of distinct eigenvalues. We say
that such a module is k-ﬁnite. Operators Q(u; p) and T(u; p) are transfer matrices constructed
from 1-ﬁnite and 2-ﬁnite modules, respectively. The two-term T Q relation (4.24) is a short
exact sequence in the Grothendieck ring of representations of the Borel subalgebra.

We provide a grading similar to the one constructed in [FH], see Propositions 4.6 and 4.14,
and use it for proving that Q(u; p) and T(u; p) are polynomials, see Propositions 5.3, 5.4. Our
construction of the grading and the proof of polynomiality are diﬀerent from those in [FH].

In order to express the eigenvalues of arbitrary transfer matrices TV,W (u; p), we develop the
theory of q-characters for representations of the Borel subalgebra. We prove some properties of
the q-characters, see Section 4.5, and use it to study ﬁnite type modules. We give a classiﬁcation
of 1-ﬁnite modules, see Proposition 4.17. We also give conjectures including the one on the
cluster algebra structure of the Grothendieck ring of the category of modules of ﬁnite type,
see Section 4.6. Then the matrix TV,W (u; p) (or the corresponding eigenvalues) is described by
an appropriate substitution of Q(u; p) (or eigenvalues of Q(u; p)) into the q-character of V , see
Proposition 5.5 and Corollary 5.7.

While we write our statements for the case of the quantum space W being a tensor product
of Fock spaces, one can easily repeat, with obvious changes, for the case when W is an arbitrary
tensor product of irreducible highest weight modules of the (dual) Borel subalgebra.

Similar two term relations hold in the case of quantum aﬃne algebras as well. We plan to

discuss this issue in a separate publication.

The text is organized as follows. In Section 2, we collect basic deﬁnitions and facts concerning
the quantum toroidal gl1 algebra E and its Borel subalgebras. In Section 3 we discuss modules
over E and its Borel subalgebra B⊥, and the theory of q-characters. Section 4 is devoted to the
study of ﬁnite type modules over B⊥. In the last Section 5 we introduce the transfer matrices,
establish the Bethe ansatz equation and write the spectra of transfer matrices. Several technical
points are collected in the Appendix.

2. Quantum toroidal gl1

In this section we summarize basic deﬁnitions and facts concerning the quantum toroidal

algebra of type gl1.

2.1. Algebra E. Throughout the text we ﬁx complex numbers q, q1, q2, q3 satisfying q2 = q2
and q1q2q3 = 1. We assume further that, for integers l, m, n ∈ Z, ql
3 = 1 holds only if
l = m = n.

2 qn

1qm

The quantum toroidal algebra of type gl1, which we denote by E, is a bi-graded C algebra
generated by en, fn (n ∈ Z), hr (r ∈ Z\{0}) and invertible elements C, C ⊥, D, D⊥, with
bi-degrees

deg en = (1, n),

deg fn = (−1, n),

deg hr = (0, r) ,

deg x = (0, 0)

(x = C, C ⊥, D, D⊥).

For a homogeneous element x ∈ E with deg x = (ν1, ν2), we say that x has principal degree ν1
and homogeneous degree ν2, and write pdeg x = ν1, hdeg x = ν2.

Elements C, C ⊥ are central in E. Elements D, D⊥ count the degrees of an element x ∈ E:
DxD−1 = q−hdeg xx, D⊥x(D⊥)−1 = qpdeg xx. The rest of the deﬁning relations are given as
follows. Using the symbols

g(z, w) = (z − q1w)(z − q2w)(z − q3w),
κr = (1 − qr

g(w, z)f (z)f (w) + g(z, w)f (w)f (z) = 0,

[en, [en−1, en+1]] = 0 ,

[fn, [fn−1, fn+1]] = 0 ,

for all n ∈ Z and r, s ∈ Z\{0}. Here we use generating series e(z) = Pn∈Z enz−n, f (z) =
Pn∈Z fnz−n, and ψ±(z) =P±n≥0 ψ±

n z−n are given by

ψ±(z) = (C ⊥)∓1 exp(cid:0) ∞Xr=1

κrh±rz∓r(cid:1) .

The relations between the hr’s and e(z), f (z) can also be written as the bilinear relations

g(C (1±1)/2z, w)ψ±(z)e(w) + g(w, C (1±1)/2z)e(w)ψ±(z) = 0 ,
g(w, C (−1±1)/2z)ψ±(z)f (w) + g(C (−1±1)/2z, w)f (w)ψ±(z) = 0 .

It is easy to see that the elements e0, f0, h±1 together with C, C ⊥, D, D⊥ generate E.

Let E = ⊕ν1,ν2∈ZEν1,ν2 be the decomposition of algebra E into bigraded subspaces. For p ∈ Z,

we set

E>p =Mν1≥p

2.2. Elliptic Hall algebra. Algebra E is a quantum version of the Lie algebra of currents
gl1[x±1, y±1] with a two dimensional central extension. It was originally introduced in [BS] and
was called elliptic Hall algebra, see also [M], [FT], [FHSSY]. We give here an account of the
deﬁnition in [BS] following [Ng2].

Let us prepare some terminology. We say that an element ν = (ν1, ν2) ∈ Z2\{(0, 0)} is
coprime if ν1, ν2 are coprime integers. We equip Z2 with the lexicographic ordering >: (ν1, ν2) >
(ν′
2. For a triangle T with vertices ν, ν′, ν′′ ∈ Z2, we write
middle(T ) = ν′ if ν > ν′ > ν′′. We say that T is a quasi-empty triangle if there are no lattice
points in its interior and on at least one of its edges.

2) if ν1 > ν′

The elliptic Hall algebra A is generated by elements pν (ν ∈ Z2\{(0, 0)}) and central elements

cν (ν ∈ Z2) satisfying c0 = 1, cν+ν′ = cνcν′. The deﬁning relations read as follows.

[prν, psν] =

[pν, pν′] =

Here M = middle(T ), and the symbol hν is deﬁned by setting
z−r

Xn≥0

hnνz−n = exp(cid:16)−Xr≥1

κrprν

r (cid:17)

for all coprime ν.

The generators p(ν1,ν2) correspond to the elements xν1yν2 of the Lie algebra. The follow-
ing PBW type basis is known. For a non-zero vector ν = (r cos θ, r sin θ) on the plane, we
deﬁne its argument by arg ν = θ, where r > 0 and −π < θ ≤ π. We say that a mono-
mial cνpν(1) · · · pν(N) ∈ A (ν ∈ Z2, ν(i) = (ν(i)
2 ) ∈ Z2\{(0, 0)}) is normal-ordered if
π ≥ arg ν(1) ≥ arg ν(2) ≥ · · · ≥ arg ν(N ) > −π, and if arg ν(i) = arg ν(i+1) then ν(i)

1 , ν(i)

.

1 ≥ ν(i+1)

Theorem 2.1. [BS] The set of all normal-ordered monomials is a basis of A.

The following result tells how the algebras E and A are related. Let E′ = hen, fn(n ∈

Z), hr(r ∈ Z\{0}), C, C ⊥i be the subalgebra of E obtained by ‘dropping’ D, D⊥.
Theorem 2.2. [S] There is an isomorphism of algebras E′ ∼→ A such that

en 7→ p(1,n) , fn 7→ p(−1,n) , C ±rh±r 7→ −

1
r

p(0,±r) ,

C 7→ c(0,1) , C ⊥ 7→ c(−1,0) ,

where n ∈ Z, r > 0.

Hereafter we identify E′ with A by the isomorphism stated in Theorem 2.2.
The presentation of A clariﬁes some properties which are not obvious in that of E′. Among
other things, the natural action of SL(2, Z) on Z2 lifts to an action of the universal cover

2.3. Hopf algebra structures. Algebra E is endowed with a topological Hopf algebra struc-
ture (E, ∆, ε, S) deﬁned in terms of the horizontal generators. For x = C, C ⊥, D, D⊥, we set
∆ x = x ⊗ x, ε(x) = 1, S(x) = x−1. For the remaining generators we deﬁne

Replacing the horizontal generators with the corresponding vertical generators, we obtain
another Hopf algebra structure (E, ∆⊥, ε⊥, S⊥). Both structures will play a role in the sequel.

2.4. Borel subalgebras. The lattice Z2 is partitioned as Z2 = {(0, 0)} ∪ Z ∪ Z, where Z =
{ν = (ν1, ν2) ∈ Z2 | ν1 > 0 or ν1 = 0, ν2 > 0}, Z = −Z. The corresponding elements pν
generate subalgebras of E,

B = hpν (ν ∈ Z), C, C ⊥, D, D⊥i ,
B = hpν (ν ∈ Z), C, C ⊥, D, D⊥i ,

which we call the Borel and the opposite Borel subalgebras, respectively, see Fig. 2.2. Both
(B, ∆, ε, S), (B, ∆, ε, S) are Hopf subalgebras of (E, ∆, ε, S). Using the presentation of the
elliptic Hall algebra, we see that algebra B is generated by en (n ∈ Z), hr (r > 0), C, C ⊥, D, D⊥,
and B by fn (n ∈ Z), h−r (r > 0), C, C ⊥, D, D⊥.

Quite generally, a bialgebra pairing on a bialgebra A is a symmetric non-degenerate bilinear

form ( , ) : A × A → C with the properties

(a, b1b2) = (∆(a), b1 ⊗ b2),

(a, 1) = ε(a)

for any a, b1, b2 ∈ A. With each such pair (A, ( , )), there is an associated bialgebra DA called
the Drinfeld double of A. As a vector space DA = A ⊗ Aop, where Aop is a copy of A endowed
with the opposite coalgebra structure. Moreover A+ = A ⊗ 1 and A− = 1 ⊗ Aop are sub
bialgebras of DA, and the commutation relation

is imposed for a, b ∈ A. Here a+ = a ⊗ 1, a− = 1 ⊗ a, and we use the Sweedler notation

X(a(2), b(1)) a−
∆(a) =P a(1) ⊗ a(2) for the coproduct.

B. FEIGIN, M. JIMBO, T. MIWA AND E. MUKHIN

In the present case, we take A to be the bialgebra (B, ∆, ε). It has a bialgebra pairing such

that the non-trivial pairings of the generators are given by

(em, en) =

1
κ1

δm,n ,

(hr, hs) =

1
rκr

δr,s ,

(C, D) = (C ⊥, D⊥) = q−1 .

This pairing respects bidegrees in the sense that (a, b) = 0 unless deg a = deg b. We identify Aop
with B via the involution θ2 : B → B given in (2.2). The Drinfeld double of B is then identiﬁed
with B ⊗ B. Its quotient by the relation x ⊗ 1 = 1 ⊗ x (x = C, C ⊥, D, D⊥) is isomorphic to the
algebra E [BS].

We can equally well use the ‘vertical’ version of Borel and opposite Borel subalgebras

Algebra E is also a quotient of the Drinfeld double of (B⊥, ∆⊥, ε⊥).

B⊥ = θ−1(B) , B

⊥

= θ(B) .

3. Modules

This section contains preliminary material on representations of E and B⊥. We shall consider
only modules on which C acts by 1. From here until the end of the paper, we drop D from the
algebra and use the same letters E, B⊥, etc., to denote the respective quotient by C − 1.

3.1. Category OE. Let V be an E module. For a ∈ C× and n ∈ Z, we set
0 v = av} , Vn = {v ∈ V | D⊥v = qnv} ,

V(a) = {v ∈ V | ψ+

and V(a,n) = V(a) ∩ Vn. If V(a,n) 6= 0 then we call (a, n) a weight of V . We denote by wt(V ) the
set of weights of V . For a vector v ∈ Vn we write pdeg v = n.

We consider a full subcategory OE of the category of all E modules. We say that V is an

object of OE if the following conditions are satisﬁed.

(i) There exists a ﬁnite subset A ⊂ C× such that V =L(a,n)∈A×Z V(a,n),

(ii) dim V(a,n) < ∞ for all a, n,
(iii) Vn = 0 if n ≫ 0.

Thanks to (iii), the coproduct ∆⊥ is well-deﬁned on the tensor product of V, W ∈ Ob OE. We
write this tensor product module as V ⊗∆⊥ W . Category OE is a monoidal category with respect
to ⊗∆⊥.

Let rE be the set of all rational functions Ψ(z) ∈ C(z) which are regular at z = 0, ∞ and

We say that an E module V is a highest ℓ-weight module with highest ℓ-weight Ψ ∈ rE if it

±jz∓j be the expansion of Ψ(z) at z±1 = ∞.

satisfy Ψ(0)Ψ(∞) = 1. Let Ψ±(z) =Pj≥0 Ψ±

is generated by a non-zero vector v0 such that

pνv0 = 0 (ν1 > 0), ψ±(z)v0 = Ψ±(z)v0 , D⊥v0 = v0 .

The unique simple module with highest ℓ-weight Ψ belongs to OE. We denote it by L(Ψ).
Modulo a shift of grading by D⊥, any simple object of category OE is of the form L(Ψ) for some
Ψ ∈ rE, see [M].

We are interested in the Grothendieck ring Rep0

E of category OE. However, many natural
representations of E do not possess ﬁnite composition series. In order to address this issue we

3.2. Examples of highest ℓ-weight modules. To write the examples of highest ℓ-weight
modules we need the notation for partitions and plane partitions.

A partition is a sequence of non-negative integers λ = (λ1, λ2, · · · ) such that λi ≥ λi+1 for
all i ≥ 1, and λi = 0 for i large enough. We write ∅ = (0, 0, 0, . . . ). The set of all partitions
is denoted by P. We identify a partition λ ∈ P with the set of points (i, j) ∈ Z2 such that

1 ≤ j ≤ λi, i ≥ 1. For λ ∈ P, we set |λ| =Pj≥1 λj and ℓ(λ) = max{j ≥ 1 | λj > 0} (λ 6= ∅),

For λ ∈ P, i ∈ Z>0, we create a new sequence of non-negative integers λ + 1i by the rule

ℓ(∅) = 0.

(λ + 1i)j = λj + δi,j. We also use the cut partitions:

(λ)≤i−1 = (λ1, · · · , λi−1, 0, 0, · · · ),

(λ)≥i+1 = (λi+1, · · · , λℓ(λ), 0, 0, · · · ) .

A plane partition is a sequence of partitions λ = (λ(1), λ(2), · · · ), λ(k) ∈ P, such that λ(k) ⊃
λ(k+1) for all k and λ(k) = ∅ for k ≫ 0. We denote the set of all plane partitions by P and for

We identify λ ∈ P with the set of points (i, j, k) ∈ Z3 such that 1 ≤ j ≤ λ(k)

, i, k ≥ 1.

i

λ ∈ P we set |λ| =Pi |λ(i)|.
For a plane partition λ =(cid:0)λ(1), · · · , λ(N )(cid:1) we set
(λ)k,i =(cid:0)λ(1), · · · , λ(k−1), (λ(k))≤i−1, ∅, ∅, · · ·(cid:1) ,

and

(λ)k,i =(cid:0)(λ(k))≥i+1, λ(k+1), · · · , λ(N ), ∅, ∅, · · ·(cid:1) ,

For a node (cid:3) = (i, j, k) ∈ Z3 we write q(cid:3) = qi

λ + 1(k)

i =(cid:0)λ(1), · · · , λ(k) + 1i, · · · , λ(N ), ∅, ∅, · · ·(cid:1) .

The most basic example of a highest ℓ-weight module is the Macmahon module M(u, K)
[FJMM1]. The Macmahon module M(u, K) has a basis {|λi} labeled by the set of all plane
partitions with the action of E given by the following explicit formulas. Namely, we have

For generic K ∈ C× (i.e. K 6= qm

1 for m, n ∈ Z) the Macmahon module is irreducible,

M(u, K) = L(cid:0)ΨM(u,K)(cid:1) , ΨM(u,K)(z) = K 1/2 1 − K −1u/z

1 − u/z

.

Clearly, the Macmahon modules M(u, K), u, K ∈ C∗, topologically generate the ring Rep E.

Another important example of a highest ℓ-weight module is the Fock module

F(u) = L(cid:0)ΨF(u)(cid:1) , ΨF(u)(z) = q

1 − q−1

The Fock module F(u) is the smallest highest ℓ-weight E module. It has a basis labeled by
partitions. The action of E is obtained from formulas (3.3),(3.4), (3.5) for the action in the
Macmahon module by specializing K = q2 and forgetting all plane partitions λ = (λ(1), λ(2), · · · )
with λ(2) 6= ∅.

The Fock module can be described also in terms of the vertical generators. The generators

3.3. Dual modules. Along with OE, we consider also a category O∨
OE, replacing condition (iii) with

E . It is deﬁned similarly as

(iii) ∨ Vn = 0 if n ≪ 0.

We deﬁne a lowest ℓ-weight module with lowest ℓ-weigth Ψ ∈ rE to be a cyclic E module
V = Ev0 such that

pνv0 = 0 (ν1 < 0), ψ±(z)v0 = Ψ±(z)v0 , D⊥v0 = v0 .

If V ∈ Ob OE and W ∈ Ob O∨

The unique simple module with lowest ℓ-weight Ψ ∈ rE belongs to O∨

E and is denoted by L∨(Ψ).
E , then the tensor product V ⊗∆⊥ W is a well deﬁned E module.
(Note however that the tensor product in the opposite order W ⊗∆⊥ V is ill deﬁned.) For an
element x ∈ E, the antipode S⊥(x) is well-deﬁned on W ∈ Ob O∨
E . This allows us to deﬁne an E
module structure on the graded dual space W ∗ = ⊕nW ∗
where w∗ ∈ W ∗, w ∈ W, x ∈ E. The result is an object in OE, which we denote by W ∗S⊥.
Similarly, (S⊥)−1(x) is well-deﬁned on V ∈ Ob OE so that V ∗(S⊥)−1 is deﬁned. With the
E , V 7→ V ∗(S⊥)−1, we obtain
assignments Ob O∨
contravariant functors which are inverse to each other.

n by setting (xw∗)(w) = w∗(cid:0)S⊥(x)w(cid:1),

E → Ob OE, W 7→ W ∗S⊥ and Ob OE → Ob O∨

Lemma 3.1. For Ψ ∈ rE, we have

(3.10)

L∨(Ψ)∗S⊥

= L(Ψ−1), L(Ψ)∗(S⊥)−1

= L∨(Ψ−1) .

Proof. It is enough to prove the ﬁrst equality. Let W = L∨(Ψ). Since W ∗S⊥ is simple, we
can write W ∗S⊥ = L(Φ) with some Φ ∈ rE. Let w0 be the lowest ℓ-weight vector of W and
0 the highest ℓ-weight vector of W ∗S⊥. There exists an E linear map W ∗S⊥ ⊗∆⊥ W → C
w∗
onto the trivial module C, sending w∗
0 ⊗ w0 to 1. On the other hand, by Lemma A.1 we have
∆⊥ψ±(z)(w∗
(cid:3)

0) ⊗ (ψ±(z)w0). It follows that 1 = Φ(z)Ψ(z).

0 ⊗ w0) = (ψ±(z)w∗

Remark. The Fock module Fu considered in our previous papers [FFJMM1], [FJMM1] is the
dual Fock module

F∨(u) = L∨(cid:18)q−1 1 − q2u/z

1 − u/z (cid:19) =(cid:0)F(q2u)(cid:1)∗(S⊥)−1

.

(cid:3)

3.4. Category OB⊥. Consider now modules over the Borel subalgebra B⊥. Category OB⊥ is
deﬁned by the same conditions (i)–(iii) as for category OE, with B⊥ modules in place of E
modules. We denote by Rep B⊥ the same completion of the Grothendieck ring of OB⊥ as for
Rep E, see (3.1).

In order to deﬁne highest ℓ-weight modules, we introduce the following subalgebras of B⊥.

(3.11)

We have B⊥

Let rB⊥ denote the set of all rational functions Ψ(z) ∈ C(z) which are regular and non-zero

at z = ∞. Let Ψ+(z) =Pm≥0 Ψ+

A cyclic B⊥ module V = B⊥v0 is a highest ℓ-weight module of highest ℓ-weight Ψ ∈ rB⊥ if

mz−m ∈ C[[z−1]] be its expansion at z = ∞.

B⊥

+v0 = Cv0 , ψ+(z)v0 = Ψ+(z)v0 , D⊥v0 = v0 .

Similarly V = B⊥v0 is a lowest ℓ-weight module with lowest ℓ-weight Ψ ∈ rB⊥ if

B⊥

−v0 = Cv0, ψ+(z)v0 = Ψ+(z)v0 , D⊥v0 = v0 .

The unique simple module with highest (resp. lowest) ℓ-weight Ψ is denoted by L(Ψ) (resp.

L∨(Ψ)). The duality relation (3.10) holds true for them as well.

We have the following result analogous to the one for E modules [M]:

Lemma 3.2. Let V be a simple B⊥ module. Then V ∈ Ob OB⊥ if and only if V = L(Ψ) for
some Ψ ∈ rB⊥.
(cid:3)

Consider highest ℓ-weight B⊥ modules

M +(u) = L(cid:0)1 − u/z(cid:1) , M −(u) = L(cid:16)

1

1 − u/z(cid:17) .

Clearly, modules M +(u) and M −(u), u ∈ C×, topologically generate the ring Rep B⊥.

We call M +(u) (resp. M −(u)) the positive (resp. negative) fundamental module.

We have the restriction functor Res : OE → OB⊥ which sends an E module to its restriction

to B⊥.

Lemma 3.3. Functor Res : OE → OB⊥ sends simple objects to simple objects. Hence the
notation L(Ψ) has an unambiguous meaning for Ψ ∈ rE.

Proof. The following proof is adapted from the one given in Proposition 3.5 of [HJ].

(m > 0). Since HomC(Vn, Vn+1) is ﬁnite dimensional, we have a linear relationPb
Pb

Let V = ⊕n∈ZVn be an object in OE. Fix n, and consider the set of operators em : Vn → Vn+1
j=a cjej|Vn = 0
where cj ∈ C (0 < a ≤ j ≤ b) and cacb 6= 0. Taking commutators with h±1 we obtain
j=a cjej+r|Vn = 0 for all r ∈ Z. It follows that operators ek|Vn (k ∈ Z) belong to the linear
span of {em|Vn}m>0. By the same argument, operators fk|Vn (k ∈ Z) belong to the linear span
of {fm|Vn}m≥0.

It is clear now that any singular vector of V with respect to B⊥ is also singular with respect
to E. It is also clear that if V is cyclic with respect to E then it is cyclic with respect to B⊥.
The assertion of the lemma follows from these.
(cid:3)

Since rB⊥ 6= rE, there are B⊥ modules which are not obtained by restricting E modules. For

example, positive and negative fundamental modules are not restrictions of E modules.

We use the linear maps

(3.13)
where Ψ ∈ rB⊥, u, a ∈ C×, given as follows.

su : L(Ψ(z/u)) → L(Ψ(z)) ,

τa : L(aΨ(z)) → L(Ψ(z)) ,

Both maps send highest ℓ-weight vectors to highest ℓ-weight vectors. In addition, su satisﬁes

su ◦ x = uhdeg xx ◦ su

(for homogeneous x ∈ B⊥),

FINITE TYPE MODULES FOR QUANTUM TOROIDAL gl1

and the map τa satisﬁes

n = e⊥
n ◦ τa
r = arh⊥

τa ◦ e⊥
τa ◦ h⊥
τa ◦ C ⊥ = a−1C ⊥ ◦ τa .

r ◦ τa

(n ∈ Z),

(r > 0),

We have τa ◦ en = en ◦ τa (n > 0), τa ◦ fn = afn ◦ τa (n ≥ 0) and τa ◦ ψ+(z) = aψ+(z) ◦ τa.

Lemma 3.4. For any Ψ ∈ rB⊥, the conditions above deﬁne maps su and τa. Moreover, su and
τa are linear isomorphisms.
(cid:3)

3.5. The q-characters. Let Z[C×] be the group ring of the multiplicative group C×. We use
the letter xa to denote the element a ∈ C×, so that xab = xaxb. For an object V of OB⊥, we
deﬁne its character by

χ(V ) = X(a,n)∈wt(V )

dim V(a,n) xatn .

The character χ(V ) belongs to the ring X0 = Z[{xa}a∈C×, t][[t−1]], and the map χ : Rep B⊥ →
X0 gives a ring homomorphism.

The q-character is a reﬁned notion of the character. It is deﬁned to be the generating function
of the generalized eigenvalues of the commuting family of operators ψ+(z). In order to give the
formal deﬁnition we prepare some notation.

For Ψ ∈ rB⊥ we set V(Ψ,n) = VΨ ∩ V(a,n), where a = Ψ+

0 and

VΨ =nv ∈ V | ∃N such that (ψ+

j − Ψ+

j )N v = 0 for all j ≥ 1o.

If V(Ψ,n) 6= 0, we say that (Ψ, n) is an ℓ-weight of V . The set of ℓ-weights of V is denoted by
ℓwt(V ). We say that a subspace W ⊂ V is ℓ-weighted if W = ⊕(Ψ,n)∈ℓwt(V )(V(Ψ,n) ∩ W ).

We introduce indeterminates Xa labeled by a ∈ C×, and set, cf. (3.2),

(3.14)

Aa =

Xq−1
s a
Xqsa

.

3Ys=1

Note that {Aa}a∈C× are algebraically independent.

For an element Ψ ∈ rB⊥, we deﬁne m(Ψ) ∈ X as follows.

m(Ψ) = xaQl
Qm

i=1 Xai
j=1 Xbj

Clearly m is a group isomorphism from the multiplicative group rB⊥ onto the group of mono-
mials in {xa, X ±1

a }a∈C×.

We deﬁne the q-character of an object V of OB⊥ by setting

χq(V ) = X(Ψ,n)∈ℓwt(V )

dim V(Ψ,n) · m(Ψ) tn .

It turns out that χq(V ) belongs to the ring

X = Z[{X ±1

a , xa (a ∈ C×) and
consisting of formal series in t−1, whose coeﬃcients are polynomials in X ±1
t. To see this it is enough to prove it in the case V = L(Ψ) (Ψ ∈ rB⊥). This will be done in
Lemma 4.16.

Under the ring homomorphism : X → X0 given by Xa = 1, xa = xa, ¯t = t, the q character

specializes to the (ordinary) character, χq(V ) = χ(V ).

Proposition 3.5. The q character map χq : Rep B⊥ → X is an injective ring homomorphism.
In particular, Rep B⊥ is a commutative ring.

Proof. The multiplicative property χq(V ⊗∆⊥ W ) = χq(V )χq(W ) follows from Lemma A.1.

0 ∈ V ′

To show the injectivity, let [V0] − [V ′

0 ∈ Ob OB⊥. Choose a term m(Ψ)tn in χq(V0) = χq(V ′

0] ∈ RepB⊥ be an element in the kernel of χq where
V0, V ′
0) which has the highest power
of t, and let v0 ∈ V0 and v′
0 be eigenvectors of ψ+(z) corresponding to the eigenvalue
Ψ(z). Then the submodule of V0 generated by v0 has a quotient isomorphic to L = L(Ψ). The
0] = [L] + [V ′] with some
same is true for v′
V, V ′ ∈ Ob OB⊥. Repeating this procedure, we obtain a sequence of objects Wk, Vk, V ′
k ∈ Ob OB⊥
(k ≥ 0) such that [Vk−1] = [Wk] + [Vk], [V ′
k], and that the highest power of
t in χq(Vk) = χq(V ′
0] are both equal to
[⊕kWk].
(cid:3)

k) is less than that of χq(Vk−1). It follows that [V0], [V ′

0 and V ′

0. Hence we can write [V0] = [L] + [V ], [V ′

k−1] = [Wk] + [V ′

3.6. Examples of characters and q-characters. We give a few characters and q-characters.

The character and the q-character of the one-dimensional module L(a), a ∈ C×, are given by

the formulas χ(cid:0)L(a)(cid:1) = χq(cid:0)L(a)(cid:1) = xa.

To compute the character and the q-character of the negative fundamental module, we ﬁrst

prove the following.

FINITE TYPE MODULES FOR QUANTUM TOROIDAL gl1

15

Proposition 3.6. The negative fundamental module M −(u) is a limit of the Macmahon module
modiﬁed by a one-dimensional module,

M −(u) = lim

K→∞(cid:0)L(K −1/2) ⊗∆⊥ M(u, K)(cid:1) .

Proof. Extending the B⊥ action on L(K −1/2), we deﬁne the action of the generators of E on it
by setting e(z) = f (z) = 0 and ψ±(z) = K −1/2. Then all relations of E are satisﬁed with the
exception of ψ+
0 = 1. We use this action on L(K −1/2) and the coproduct ∆⊥ to deﬁne the
action of all generators of E on M = L(K −1/2) ⊗∆⊥ M(u, K).

0 ψ−

The underlying vector space of M has a basis labeled by plane partitions. From the formulas
(3.3), (3.4), (3.5), we see that the matrix coeﬃcients of f (z) acting in M are independent of K,
while those of e(z) and ψ+(z) are polynomials in K −1. Hence all generators have well deﬁned
limits as K → ∞ and give a structure of a B⊥ module on M.

0 is zero, in particular it is not invertible, so we do not get the

We note that the limit of ψ−
structure of an E-module on M.

Operator ψ+(z) have simple joint spectrum, and the non-zero matrix coeﬃcients of er, fn
(r > 0, n ≥ 0) remain non-zero in the limit. It follows that M is an irreducible B⊥ module
with highest ℓ-weight (1 − u/z)−1, and hence coincides with M −(u).
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.7. The character and the q-character of the negative fundamental module are
given by

χ(cid:0)M −(u)(cid:1) = χ0 ,
χq(cid:0)M −(u)(cid:1) =

Proof. By Proposition 3.6, χq(cid:0)M −(u)(cid:1) is obtained by taking the K → ∞ limit of product of

xK −1/2 and (3.15).

(cid:3)

Proposition 3.8. The character of the positive fundamental module is given by

Proof. We have M +(u) = (L∨((1 − u/z)−1))∗S⊥ by (3.10), and it is clear that

χ(cid:0)M +(u)(cid:1) = χ0 .

χ(cid:0)(L∨((1 − u/z)−1))∗S⊥(cid:1) = χ(cid:0)L∨((1 − u/z)−1)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t→t−1

= χ(cid:0)L((1 − u/z)−1))(cid:1) .

(cid:3)

Hence χ(cid:0)M +(u)(cid:1) = χ(cid:0)M −(u)(cid:1).

The q-character of positive fundamental module is very diﬀerent from the q-character of
negative fundamental module. We compute it later in Proposition 4.7 (see also Corollary 4.11).

4. Finite type modules

For a positive integer k, we say that a B⊥ module V is k-ﬁnite if ψ+(z) has k distinct
eigenvalues on V . Tensor product of a k1-ﬁnite module and a k2-ﬁnite module is at most k1k2-
ﬁnite. We say V is of ﬁnite type if it is k-ﬁnite for some k. Certainly ﬁnite dimensional modules
are of ﬁnite type. But there exist also inﬁnite dimensional modules of ﬁnite type.

Denote by Of in

B⊥ the full subcategory of OB⊥ consisting of all ﬁnite type modules. This category

is the subject of this section.

4.1. Modules with polynomial highest ℓ-weight. Consider highest ℓ-weight B⊥ modules
whose highest ℓ-weights are polynomials in z−1:

(4.1)

M = L(Ψ), Ψ(z) ∈ rB⊥ ∩ C[z−1].

Abusing slightly the language, we say that M has a polynomial highest ℓ-weight. Such modules
have special properties which play a key role in the subsequent construction.

Recall that the positive fundamental module M +(u) has a polynomial highest ℓ-weight.

The ﬁrst property is polynomiality of currents acting on M. Introduce the notation for half

currents

e>(z) =

∞Xn=1

enz−n,

f≥(z) =

∞Xn=0

fnz−n ∈ B⊥[[z−1]] .

Proposition 4.1. Let M be as in (4.1). Then for each vector w ∈ M we have

(4.2)

e>(z)w, f≥(z)w ∈ M ⊗ C[z−1] , ψ+(z)w ∈ Ψ(z) · M ⊗ C[z−1].

The second property is the existence of a tensor product with respect to ∆.

Proposition 4.2. Let V ∈ Ob OE be an E module, and let M be as in (4.1). Then the coproduct
∆ gives a structure of B⊥ module on the tensor product V ⊗M. Denoting this module by V ⊗∆M
we have V ⊗∆ M ≃ V ⊗∆⊥ M.

The third property is concerned with the structure of submodules of V ⊗∆ M.

Proposition 4.3. Let V ∈ Ob OE be an E module, and let M be as in (4.1). Assume that V
is irreducible with highest ℓ-weight vector v0. Then any proper submodule of V ⊗∆ M has the
form V (0) ⊗ M, where V (0) is an ℓ-weighted linear subspace of V which does not contain v0.

Proofs of these Propositions are technical, so we defer them to Appendix. Proposition 4.1
appears as Lemma A.3, Proposition 4.2 as Lemma A.4 and Corollary A.6, and Proposition 4.3
as Lemma A.9, respectively.

4.2. Grading on M . Frenkel and Hernandez showed that positive fundamental modules for
quantum aﬃne algebras as vector spaces admit a grading with favorable properties (see [FH],
Theorem 6.1). This was a key step in their proof of polynomiality of Q operators. We show
here that an analogous grading exists in the case of various modules of quantum toroidal gl1
algebra.
In this section, our goal is Proposition 4.6 below which constructs the grading for
modules with polynomial highest ℓ-weights.

V = F(u1) ⊗∆⊥ · · · ⊗∆⊥ F(uN ) .

We denote by wM the highest ℓ-weight vector of M, and by |∅iV the tensor product of |∅i ∈
F(ui). By Proposition 4.2, the tensor product V ⊗∆ M with respect to ∆ is a well-deﬁned B⊥
module. We begin with some lemmas.

Lemma 4.4. Let V6−1 denote the subspace of V in (4.4) consisting of vectors of principal
degree ≤ −1. Then the subspace S = V6−1 ⊗ M is a B⊥ submodule of V ⊗∆ M.

Proof. Since B⊥

0 do not increase the principal degree, it is enough to show that B⊥

+S ⊂
−r (r ≥ 2) and [e0, e2]. We show ∆(x)S ⊂ S

+ is generated by en (n ≥ 1), e⊥

First consider the case of en (n ≥ 1). We have for v ⊗ w ∈ S

∆(e>(z))(v ⊗ w) = (e(z)v ⊗ ψ+(z)w)> + v ⊗ e>(z)w ,

where (cid:0)Pn∈Z anz−n(cid:1)> = Pn>0 anz−n. The second term in the right hand side belongs to

S. The ﬁrst term also does if pdeg v < −1. Suppose pdeg v = −1. We may assume that
v = |∅i ⊗ · · · ⊗ |(cid:3)i ⊗ · · · ⊗ |∅i, where |(cid:3)i ∈ F(ui) is a vector of degree −1. Using (A.1) in
Appendix, we ﬁnd

e(z)v ∈ C|∅iV × δ(ui/z)

q − q−1uj/z

.

NYj=i+1

On the other hand, Proposition 4.1 tells that ψ+(z)w is divisible by Ψ(z). Hence the ﬁrst term
vanishes.

Next consider ∆(e⊥

−r)(v ⊗ w) (r ≥ 2). This vector is a sum of terms of the form (A.22)
applied to v ⊗ w. We are concerned only with terms whose ﬁrst component is proportional to
|∅iV . Then the ﬁrst component produces a delta function δ(ui/zj′

The case of [e0, e2] is quite similar.

Proof. We retain the notation of Lemma 4.4.

In the quotient (cid:0)V ⊗∆ M(cid:1)/S, the image of
|∅iV ⊗ wM generates a submodule with irreducible quotient L(eΨ), where eΨ(z) = qN Ψ(q2z). By

(3.13), we have an isomorphism as a vector space

By comparing the characters, we ﬁnd that there is an isomorphism of B⊥ modules

Φ1 = s−1

q2 ◦ τqN : L(eΨ) −→ L(Ψ) = M .
Φ2 :(cid:0)V ⊗∆ M(cid:1)/S ∼−→ L(eΨ) .

Let further Φ3 denote the composition of the natural maps

M −→ C|∅iV ⊗ M ֒→ V ⊗∆ M −→(cid:0)V ⊗∆ M(cid:1)/S .

We set Φ = const.Φ1 ◦ Φ2 ◦ Φ3, choosing const. ∈ C× so that ΦwM = wM . By construction Φ

We have proved (4.5), (4.6), (4.7).

In order to prove that Φ is diagonalizable, we use that the dual right module M ∗ is generated

Let us prove (4.10). For each y ∈ B⊥

−, statement (4.10) is reduced to the following statement:

(4.13)

For all m ≥ 0 and all homogeneous elements x ∈ B⊥

+ we have

[x, y]M[m] ⊂

M[m − hdeg(xy) + j] .

−N pdeg yXj=0

To see that (4.13) implies (4.10), take v ∈ M[m] ∩ Mn and write yv = Pl≥0 wl, wl ∈ M[l].

Without loss of generality we may assume that pdeg y < 0. Since M is irreducible, for any l0
such that wl0 6= 0 we can take an x ∈ B⊥
+ satisfying xv = 0 and xwl0 = wM . On the other
hand, (4.13) implies

xwl = xyv = [x, y]v ∈

Xl≥0

−N pdeg yXj=0

M[m − hdeg(xy) + j].

Since xwl0 ∈ M[l0 − hdeg x], we must have m − hdeg y ≤ l0 ≤ m − hdeg y − N pdeg y. This
implies (4.10).

Note that if (4.10) holds for y1, y2 then it holds for y1y2. Hence it suﬃces to consider the

case where y is a generator of B⊥

the aid of these relations we ﬁnd that [e⊥

(4.9) apply, and therefore (4.13) holds for y = fn. In particular, if (4.13) is true for y then it is
true also for [f0, y]. Hence (4.13) holds for all y in the subalgebra N⊥

4.3. 1-ﬁnite modules. We use Proposition 4.6 to study the structure of the module M.

We start with positive fundamental modules.

Proposition 4.7. Module M +(u) is 1-ﬁnite. We have

(4.14)

χq(M +(u)) = Xu × χ(M +(u)) = Xu × χ0 .

20

B. FEIGIN, M. JIMBO, T. MIWA AND E. MUKHIN

Proof. For each n ≤ 0, we take a basis of M +(u)n by choosing a basis from each component
M[m] ∩ M +(u)n, m ≥ 0. In this basis, ψ
(z) = ψ+(z)/(1 − u/z) is represented by a triangular
matrix with 1 on the diagonal by Proposition 4.6. Therefore ψ+(z) has only one eigenvalue
(cid:3)

1 − u/z, and χq(cid:0)M +(u)(cid:1) has the stated form.

Remark.
It is instructive to think of the result (4.14) as a formal limit of the q-character
of the Macmahon module. Namely, rescaling u to Ku in (3.15) and demanding the rule

K→0

AKu = 1, we have formally

XKu = lim

The positive fundamental modules have the following description.

Proposition 4.9. Module M +(u) is the unique cyclic B⊥ module generated by v0 satisfying

(4.15)

B⊥

+v0 = Cv0 , ψ+(z)v0 = (1 − u/z)v0, p−n,lv0 = 0

(1 ≤ n ≤ l).

with 0 ≤ l < n applied to v0 (see Theorem 2.1), we have

j=0 M[−l + j]. Since
M[m] = 0 for m < 0, M[0] = Cv0 and n ≥ 1, we obtain v = 0. Therefore the relations (4.15)
are satisﬁed in M +(u).

Proof. Suppose 1 ≤ n ≤ l, and let v = p−n,lv0. By (4.10) we have v ∈Pn
Let fM +(u) denote the cyclic B⊥ module deﬁned by the relations (4.15). Then there is a
surjective morphism fM +(u) → M +(u). Since fM +(u) is spanned by ordered monomials of p−n,l
The right hand side equals χ(cid:0)M +(u)(cid:1) by Proposition 3.8. Hence the two modules coincide. (cid:3)

Finally, we show that arbitrary tensor products of fundamental modules are irreducible. In
the case of quantum aﬃne algebras, this result is due to [FH]. Our proof below is diﬀerent
from theirs and is equally applicable to that case.

χ(cid:0)fM +(u)(cid:1) ≪ χ0 .

j=1(1 − uj/z)(cid:1).

Proposition 4.10. For any u1, · · · , uN ∈ C×, the tensor product M +(u1)⊗∆⊥ · · ·⊗∆⊥ M +(uN )

Proof. Set M = M +(u1) ⊗∆⊥ · · · ⊗∆⊥ M +(uN ). By Corollary 4.8, M is 1-ﬁnite. The dual
module M ∨ = (M)∗(S⊥)−1 is isomorphic to M −∨(uN ) ⊗∆⊥ · · · ⊗∆⊥ M −∨(u1). By an analog

of Corollary 3.7 for lowest ℓ-weight modules, we have χq(cid:0)M ∨(cid:1) = m(Ψ)−1(cid:0)1 + · · ·(cid:1), where
Ψ(z) =QN

1 . From the structure of χq(M ∨) mentioned
1 has a singular vector of ℓ-weight Φ(z)−1 diﬀerent from
above, we see that either M ∨
Ψ(z)−1. Let M1 ⊂ M denote the orthogonal complement of M ∨
1 . From Lemma 3.1, we conclude
that either M/M1 or M1 has the ℓ-weight Φ(z). Hence M has two diﬀerent ℓ-weights Ψ(z) and
Φ(z). This is a contradiction. Therefore M ∨ is irreducible, and hence M is irreducible.

4.4. 2-ﬁnite modules. Now we proceed to discussing 2-ﬁnite modules. Introduce the module

N +(u) = L(cid:0)ΨN +(u)(cid:1) , ΨN +(u)(z) = Q3

i=1(1 − q−1
1 − u/z

i u/z)

.

Our goal in this subsection is to prove Theorem 4.13 below.

We make use of a construction similar to the one used in the proof of Lemma 4.4. Let F(u)
be the Fock module (3.6) with the highest weight vector |∅i. Let F(u)6−2 be the subspace of
3 u) ⊗∆⊥ M +(q−1
F(u) of principal degree ≤ −2. Set further M(u) = M +(q−1
1 u). By Proposition
4.10, M(u) is a 1-ﬁnite module L(Ψ) with highest ℓ-weight Ψ(z) = (1 − q−1
3 u/z)(1 − q−1
1 u/z).
We consider the module V = F(u) ⊗∆ M(u) and its linear subspace S = F(u)6−2 ⊗ M(u). In
the following, |(cid:3)i stands for the vector |λi ∈ F(u) for the partition λ = (1).

Lemma 4.12. Notation being as above, S is a B⊥ submodule of V .

Proof. Obviously S is invariant under the action of B⊥
−
v ∈ F(u)6−2 and w ∈ M(u). Then we have

B⊥

0 . We show that B⊥

+S ⊂ S. Let

(4.16)

e>(z)(v ⊗ w) = (e(z)v ⊗ ψ+(z)w)> + v ⊗ e>(z)w .

The second term in the right hand side belongs to S. The ﬁrst term also does unless pdeg v =
−2. If this is the case, then e(z)v ∈ (Cδ(q−1
3 u/z))|(cid:3)i. On the other hand, by
Lemma A.3 and the deﬁnition of M(u), ψ+(q−1
1 u) = 0 hold on M(u). Therefore
the ﬁrst term vanishes and (4.16) belongs to S.

1 u/z) + Cδ(q−1
3 u) = ψ+(q−1

By the same argument as in the proof of Lemma 4.4, we see also that e⊥

−r(v ⊗ w) ∈ S for
(cid:3)

r > 0 and [e0, e2](v ⊗ w) ∈ S.

Theorem 4.13. Module N +(u) is 2-ﬁnite. Its q-character is given by

N1 = C|(cid:3)i ⊗ M(u) (we omit writing mod S). Let Pi : N → Ni (i = 0, 1) be the projection.

We have

where

(4.18)

ψ+(z)(cid:0)|∅i ⊗ w(cid:1) = a0(z)|∅i ⊗ ψ+(z)w , ψ+(z)(cid:0)|(cid:3)i ⊗ w(cid:1) = a1(z)|(cid:3)i ⊗ ψ+(z)w ,

(4.22)

. Namely, for y = fn with n ≥ 0 we obtain

i

(4.23)

With a similar computation we have the same equations for y = ψ+,⊥

Now we show that N is irreducible. Let W ⊂ N be a non-zero B⊥ submodule. We have the
decomposition into ℓ-weight spaces W = W0 ⊕ W1, Wi = W ∩ Ni. Using (4.20), (4.21), and the
irreducibility of M(u) which follows from Proposition 4.10, we obtain either |∅i ⊗ w0 ∈ W0 or
|(cid:3)i ⊗ w0 ∈ W1. It is easy to see that one implies the other, and hence both are satisﬁed. Since
UiB⊥

i w0 = M(u), (4.22),(4.23) imply that Wi = Ni, i = 0, 1. Hence W = N.

Comparing the highest ℓ-weight, we conclude that N = τq−1(cid:0)N +(u)(cid:1). The assertion about

the q-character is clear from (4.19) and the proof above.

A similar lemma holds for the action of e(z) with the replacement of A−1

equation m = n − 1 by m = n + 1.

In the following, for Ψ(z) = p(z)/q(z) ∈ rB⊥ with p(z), q(z) ∈ C[z−1], we set d(Ψ) =

degz−1 p − degz−1 q.

Proof. If d(Ψ) ≤ 0, then V is a subquotient of a tensor product of several Macmahon modules
M(u, K) and negative fundamental modules M −(u). The q-characters of M(u, K) and M −(u)
have the required form, see (3.15) and (3.18). Hence the lemma is true in this case.

If d(Ψ) > 0, then V is a subquotient of a tensor product of several Macmahon modules with
a module which has a polynomial highest ℓ-weight. Then the lemma follows from Proposition
4.3.

We have the classiﬁcation of 1-ﬁnite modules.

Proposition 4.17. Let Ψ ∈ rB⊥ and V = L(Ψ). Then V is 1-ﬁnite if and only if V has
polynomial highest ℓ-weight.

Proof. It suﬃces to prove the ‘only if’ part.

Suppose d(Ψ) ≤ 0. From (4.30), V is 1-ﬁnite if and only if it is one-dimensional. It is easy
to see that one-dimensional modules are exactly L(a), a ∈ C×. Hence the assertion is true in
this case.

Let d(Ψ) > 0. We can write Ψ(z) = Ψ1(z)Ψ2(z) where Ψ1(z) ∈ rE, Ψ2(z) ∈ rB⊥ ∩ C[z−1].
Set W = L(Ψ1) and M = L(Ψ2). In view of Proposition 4.3, V is a quotient of the module
W ⊗∆ M by a submodule of the form W (0) ⊗∆ M, where W (0) does not contain the highest
ℓ-weight vector of W . We may assume that the poles of Ψ1(z) do not overlap with the zeroes
of Ψ2(z). Then by Lemma 4.15 we must have that W (0) ∩ W−1 = 0. Therefore, if V is 1-ﬁnite,
then Ψ1(z) = 1.

2 u/z)/(1 − u/z)(cid:1). By [FFJMM2], this module has a basis of plane

partitions with at most k layers: λ = (λ(1), . . . , λ(k), ∅, ∅, · · · ). Let M = M +(uqi

We consider the tensor product V = F (u)⊗∆M. Let S ⊂ V be the subspace spanned by vectors
of the form |λi ⊗ v, where v ∈ M and λ is such that either λ(1)
i+1 > 0. Then, arguing
as in Lemma 4.12, we see that S ⊂ V is a submodule. Clearly V /S has ﬁnite type.

Next, we discuss the grading. Recall that we constructed the grading for modules with
polynomial highest ℓ-weights, see Proposition 4.6, and for N +(u), see Proposition 4.14. This
grading has the following property. The annihilation operators and the modiﬁed current ψ
(z)
respect the grading given by their homogeneous degrees. The action of creation operators is
not graded, but it changes the grading in a controllable way. We expect that such a grading
exists for all ﬁnite type modules.

An interesting question is to compute the formal character of a ﬁnite type module with

respect to this grading.

Finally, we suggest a cluster algebra structure on the category Of in

B⊥ in the spirit of [HL]. For

generalities on cluster algebras, we refer to [FZ].

Recall that a quiver Γ is an oriented graph. It is given by a set of vertices Γ0, a set of arrows
Γ1 and maps s,t: Γ1 → Γ0, called source and target, respectively. We will assume that Γ has
no loops and no 2-cycles. That is for any α ∈ Γ1 we have s(α) 6= t(α), and for any α1, α2 ∈ Γ0,
we have t(α1) = s(α2) implies s(α1) 6= t(α2).

Given a domain R, a cluster is a pair (Γ, c), where Γ is a quiver and c is a map c : Γ0 → R.

The image of c is called the set of cluster variables.

Let R = Rep Of in

B⊥ be the Grothendieck ring of the category of ﬁnite type modules. A mutation
of the cluster (Γ, c) in the direction γ ∈ Γ0 is a new cluster with the following properties. The
new quiver has the same set of vertices Γ0. The set of new arrows is obtained from Γ1 by the
following three steps:

(i) for each subquiver γ1 → γ → γ2 add a new arrow γ1 → γ2;
(ii) reverse all arrows with source or target γ;
(iii) remove all 2-cycles.

The new map cγ : Γ0 → R is given by cγ(γ1) = c(γ1) if γ1 6= γ and

for some d ∈ Z≥0. If such d and the new cluster variable cγ(γ) ∈ R exist, they are unique, and
we say that the cluster (Γ, c) can be mutated in the direction γ ∈ Γ0.

We deﬁne the quiver as follows: Γ0 = Z3 and (i1, j1, k1) → (i2, j2, k2) if and only if (i2, j2, k2) ∈
2 as

{(i1 + 1, j1, k1), (i1, j1 + 1, k1), (i1, j1, k1 + 1)}. For (cid:3) = (i, j, k) ∈ Z3 we set q(cid:3) = qi
before.

1qk

Then for a ∈ C×, we deﬁne the seed — or the initial cluster — (Γ, c0) by sending vertices of

our graph to the positive fundamental modules:

(4.32)

c0 : Z3 → Rep Of in
B⊥ ,

(cid:3) 7→ [M +(aq(cid:3))].

Lemma 4.21. The cluster (Γ, c0) can be mutated in any direction (cid:3) ∈ Γ0. The new cluster
variable is the class of the 2-ﬁnite module [N +(aq(cid:3))].

Proof. The mutation equation (4.31) in the case of the lemma coincides with (4.24).

(cid:3)

We also note that by Proposition 4.10 a product of any modules in the initial cluster is

irreducible. We have the following conjecture motivated by [HL].

A B⊥ module V is called prime if it cannot be written as tensor product of two modules
both of which are not one-dimensional. A B⊥ module V is called real if V ⊗∆⊥ V is irreducible.
A B⊥ module V is called normalized if V0 6= 0 and Vn = 0 for n ∈ Z>0.

Conjecture 4.22. (i) The cluster (Γ, c0) can be repeatedly mutated in any sequence of direc-
tions. Each mutation corresponds to a short exact sequence in category Of in
B⊥ .

(ii) Every cluster variable obtained through a sequence of mutations is an irreducible prime

real module.

(iii) Every irreducible prime real normalized module appears as a cluster variable.

FINITE TYPE MODULES FOR QUANTUM TOROIDAL gl1

27

(iv) Any tensor product module corresponding to a cluster variable in the same cluster is
irreducible. In particular, both terms in the left hand side of mutation equation (4.31) correspond
to irreducible modules.

Remark. For quantum aﬃne algebras, Hernandez and Leclerc found a cluster algebra struc-
ture of the Grothendicek ring of O+, which is the category generated by ﬁnite dimensional
modules and the positive fundamental modules, see the announcement in [H]. It can be shown
that O+ coincides with the category of ﬁnite type modules for quantum aﬃne algebras. Also
there exist 2-ﬁnite modules analogous to N +(u) which satisfy 2-term TQ relations, allowing for
intepretation as mutations. We hope to discuss these issues elsewhere.

5. Bethe ansatz

5.1. Universal R matrix. As was mentioned in Subsection 2.4, algebra E is a quotient of
the quantum double of its Borel subalgebra B⊥, and hence is equipped with the universal R
matrix. For a technical reason (see Remark after Proposition 5.1 below), we use the R matrix
R associated with the opposite coproduct ∆⊥,op = σ ◦ ∆⊥, where σ(a ⊗ b) = b ⊗ a. Its main
properties are as follows.

where, as usual, the suﬃxes i, j of Ri,j stand for the tensor components, e.g., R1,2 = R ⊗ 1.

Element R has the form (see [BS], [Ng])

where C ⊥ = qc⊥, D⊥ = qd⊥. In what follows we consider tensor product modules V ⊗∆⊥ W with
V ∈ Ob OB⊥ and W ∈ Ob OE. Formula (5.7) gives a well deﬁned operator on such modules.

5.2. Normalized R matrix and polynomiality. In this section, we take u to be an indeter-
minate.

We deﬁne su : E → E[u±1] by setting su(x) = uhdeg xx for any homogeneous element x ∈ E.

We set also

R(u) =(cid:0)su ⊗ id(cid:1)(cid:0)R(cid:1) ∈ B⊥b⊗B

[[u]] .

In formula (5.4) for R+, the ﬁrst tensor component of each term acts as annihilation operator on
modules from OB⊥. Likewise, in formula (5.5) for R−, the second tensor component of each term
acts as annihilation operator on modules from OE. Therefore, if V ∈ Ob OB⊥ and W ∈ Ob OE,
then each coeﬃcient of the formal series R(u) is a well deﬁned operator on V ⊗∆⊥ W .

Suppose further that V is a tensor product of highest ℓ-weight B⊥ modules, and W is
a tensor product of highest ℓ-weight E modules. Denote by v0 ∈ V the tensor product of
highest ℓ-weight vectors, and by w0 ∈ W the tensor product of highest ℓ-weight vectors. We
write the eigenvalues of hr on these vectors as hhriV , hhriW , respectively. Suppose that C ⊥
acts on V as a scalar C ⊥
W . From the remark above, we see that

V and on W as a scalar C ⊥

m=0M[m] be the grading in Proposition 4.6, and denote by u∂ the

u∂¯hr,V u−∂M[m] ⊂ u−rM[m − r] ,

operator u∂Lh∅|,|∅i(u)u−∂ is independent of u, and (5.11) holds true for this element.

Since W = F(v) is generated from |∅i by {h⊥

r }r>0, formula (5.9) allows us to compute
Lh∅|,w2(u) for all w2 ∈ W inductively. Formula (5.10) with n ≤ 0 then allows us to compute
Lw1,w2(u) for all w1 ∈ W ∗ and w2 ∈ W , because W ∗ = F(v)∗ is generated from h∅| by {e⊥

(note that en (n ≥ 2) and [e0, e2] are generated by e⊥

Lw1,w2(u) is expressed asP ai(u)xiLh∅|,|∅i(u)yi with some xi, yi ∈ B⊥ and ai(u) ∈ C[u]. Hence

5.3. Bethe ansatz. For an object V ∈ OB⊥, the twisted transfer matrix associated with the
‘auxiliary space’ V is a formal series deﬁned by

TV (u; p) = TrV,1(cid:16)(p−d⊥

⊗ id) · R(u)(cid:17) ∈ B

⊥

[[u, p]][p−1] .

Here TrV,1 means that the trace is taken on the ﬁrst tensor component. Clearly we have

TV1⊕V2(u; p) = TV1(u; p) + TV2(u; p) ,
TV1⊗V2(u; p) = TV2(u; p)TV1(u; p) ,

hence the assignment V 7→ TV gives a homomorphism of rings from Rep B⊥ to B

[[u, p]][p−1].
Element TV (u; p) gives rise to a formal series of operators which act on any given ‘quantum

space’ W ∈ OE. It is convenient to use the normalized R matrix and deﬁne

TV,W (u; p) = TrV,1(cid:0)(p−d⊥ ⊗ id)RV,W (u)(cid:1)

so that TV (u; p)(cid:12)(cid:12)W = fV,W (u)TV,W (u; p). Note that TV,W (u; p) acts on each subspace of W of

In what follows W is ﬁxed, we drop it from notation and simply write Q(u; p) and T(u; p).

Proposition 5.3. On the subspace W−k of principal degree −k, Q(u; p) is a polynomial in u
of degree at most k.

Proof. Let Qn(u) = TrM +(1)−nRM +(1),W (u) denote the trace over the subspace M +(1)−n of ﬁxed

principal degree −n. We have Q(u; p) =P∞

n=0 pnQn(u). Since

RM +(1),W (u) = RM +(1),F(vN )(u) · · · RM +(1),F(v1)(u),

each matrix element of RM +(1),W (u) is a polynomial in u by Proposition 5.1. Moreover (5.11)
implies that for each vector w ∈ W−k the degree of Qn(u)w does not exceed k. Therefore
Q(u; p)w is also a polynomial in u of degree at most k.
(cid:3)

Proposition 5.4. On each subspace of W of ﬁxed principal degree, T(u; p) is a polynomial in
u.

Proof. This follows from Proposition 5.2.

Since the map V 7→ TV is a ring homomorphism, relations in Rep B⊥ implies those for
the transfer matrices. It allows us to express any transfer matrix TV,W (u; p) via the operator
Q(u; p). The recipe is as follows.

and replace each Xa by fM +(1),W (a)Q(a; p), each xa in m(Ψ)
by a−d⊥, and each t−1 by pqN . Then the resulting series coincides with fV,W (u)TV,W (u; p).

Proof. In general, if V = L(Ψ) with Ψ(z) = aQi(1 − ai/z)/Qj(1 − bj/z), then by Lemma 4.16

its q-character takes the form

Since χq is injective, we have an identity in Rep B⊥

was obtained in [FT2] .

In particular, Proposition 5.5 allows to compute the spectrum of T (V ) from that of Q(u; p).

Corollary 5.7. Let w be an eigenvector of Q(u; p). Then the eigenvalue of TV,W (u; p) is given
by the recipe of Proposition 5.5, replacing Q(u; p) by its eigenvalue Qw(u; p) on w.

Finally, we show that zeroes of eigenvalues of Qw(u; p) satisfy the Bethe ansatz equation.
Let w ∈ W−k be an eigenvector of Q(u; p) of principal degree −k. By Proposition 5.3,

Qw(u; p) is a polynomial of degree at most k, so it has the form

Qw(u; p)
Qw(0; p)

=

(1 − u/ζi(p; w)) ,

where some of ζi(p; w)’s may be ∞. We conjecture that all roots are in fact ﬁnite.

The automorphism θ2 in (2.2) is an anti-automorphism of coalgebras with respect to ∆⊥.

Applying θ2 ⊗ θ2 to both sides of (A.1), (A.2), we obtain (A.3), (A.4).

(A.19)

n v = 0 for suﬃciently large n,
if a ∈ C× is a zero of Ψ(z), then ψ+(a)v = 0.

Proof. We prove the assertion by induction on − pdeg v.

When v = v0 is the highest ℓ-weight vector, (A.18) and (A.19) are evident except for fnv.
m+nv0 = 0
−mfnv0 = 0 (m ≥ 2), [e0, e2]fnv = 0 for degree reasons. Hence fnv0 = 0 by

pdeg v = −l. There are two cases to consider, v = frv′ (r ≥ 0), or v = ψ+,⊥

If v = frv′, then xnv = [xn, fr]v′ + frxnv′. For large n this vanishes by (A.15), its analog for

A.3. Coproduct ∆ and 1-ﬁnite modules. We restate and prove Proposition 4.2 as the
following lemma.

Lemma A.4. (i) Algebra B⊥ is a left coideal of E with respect to ∆: ∆(B⊥) ⊂ Eb⊗B⊥, where
b⊗ means the completed tensor product with respect to the homogeneous degree.

(ii) Let V be an E module, and let M = L(Ψ) with Ψ ∈ rB⊥ ∩ C[z−1]. Then ∆(B⊥) has a

well-deﬁned action on V ⊗ M.

in the

and Bj = 1 ⊗ e(zj). We write ad X = L(X) − R(X) where L(X) (resp. R(X)) means
multiplication by X from the left (resp. from the right). Expanding the product, and taking
coeﬃcients of terms of the type Bj, we obtain a linear combination of terms of the following

Corollary A.6. Let V be an object of OE, and let M = L(Ψ) with Ψ ∈ rB⊥ ∩ C[z−1]. Then we
have an isomorphism of B⊥ modules

V ⊗∆ M ≃ V ⊗∆⊥ M .

Proof. We show that the element σ(R−), where σ(a ⊗ b) = b ⊗ a, has a well deﬁned action on
V ⊗ M. To see this, let M = ⊕m≥0M[m] be the grading of vector space mentioned in Remark
at the end of Subsection 4.3. Take vectors v ∈ V and w ∈ M[m]. Then σ(R)v ⊗ w is a sum
of terms of the form y′
−ν1,ν2w (see (5.5)). For them to be non-zero we must have
ν1 + pdeg v ≤ 0 and m − ν2 + Nν1 ≥ 0, where N = degz−1 Ψ. Hence the sum is ﬁnite.

Setting F = σ(R−) we have F ∆(x) = ∆⊥(x)F (x ∈ B⊥) by Lemma A.5. Therefore F :

W ∋ ∆e>(z) · w =(cid:0)e(z) ⊗ ψ+(z)(cid:1)> · w +(cid:0)1 ⊗ e>(z)(cid:1) · w .

By Lemma A.7, the ﬁrst term is a sum of terms of ℓ-weight diﬀerent from that of w, while

the second term has the same ℓ-weight because M is 1-ﬁnite. Hence (cid:0)e(z) ⊗ ψ+(z)(cid:1)> · w,
(cid:0)1 ⊗ e>(z)(cid:1) · w both belong to W . Similarly, for r ≥ 2 we have
e1(cid:17)w = 1 ⊗(cid:0)ad e0(cid:1)r−1

Lemma A.9. We retain the assumptions (A.25), (A.26). Let m0 be the highest ℓ-weight vector

by induction on n. By deﬁnition (A.29) is true for n = 0. Assuming it for n > −N, we take
m ∈ M−N .

Consider ﬁrst the case m = fpm′. We set p0 = max{p | fpm′ 6= 0}. There exists an x ∈ B⊥
−jv ⊗ fp+jm′ ∈ W for v ∈ V (0). Applying
−jv ∈ V (0)

such that xfp0m′ = m0. By (A.28), we havePp0−p

1 ⊗ x to both sides and using (A.27), we ﬁnd inductively for p = p0, p0 − 1, · · · that ψ−
(0 ≤ j ≤ p0) and v ⊗ fpm′ ∈ W (0 ≤ p ≤ p0).

Next we consider the case m = ψ⊥

r m′, pdeg w′ = −N + r. Setting w′ = v ⊗ m′ where v ∈ V (0)

and we have
W ∋ ∆[f−1, e⊥

r−1]w′ = [f−1 ⊗ 1, ∆e⊥

From the previous paragraph we see that the ﬁrst and the third terms belong to W . The
second term has the form [ψ−

at least one fi in the ﬁrst component. Arguing similarly as in Lemma A.8 we obtain that
(1 ⊗ [f−1, e⊥

r−1])w′ ∈ W . This shows V (0) ⊗ ψ⊥

r m′ ∈ W .

Assuming pdeg m1 ≤ pdeg mr (r ≥ 2), we choose an x ∈ B⊥

r=1 vr ⊗mr
(vr ∈ V , mr ∈ M) be an expression where {vr} and {mr} are linearly independent sets. We
show that vr ∈ V (0) for all r by induction on N.

Let us show that V (0) ⊗M = W . Let w ∈ W be an ℓ-weight vector, and let w =PN
(A.27), we havePN
hence PN
By (A.29) we havePN

+ such that xm1 = m0. By
r=1 vr ⊗ xmr ∈ W . For degree reasons we have xmr = arm0 for some ar ∈ C,
r=1 arvr ∈ V (0) where we set a1 = 1. If N = 1, then we are done. Suppose N ≥ 2.
r=2
r=2 are linearly independent, the induction hypothesis applies and we obtain

and {mr − arm1}N
vr ∈ V (0) for 2 ≤ r ≤ N. This in turn implies v1 ∈ V (0).

r=1 arvr ⊗ m1 ∈ W , so thatPN

r=2 vr ⊗ (mr − arm1) ∈ W . Since {vr}N

Finally, (A.28) implies f≥(z)V (0) ⊂ V (0). From the proof of Lemma 3.3, we obtain that

f (z)V (0) ⊂ V (0). Therefore v0 ∈ V (0) if and only if V (0) = V .

The proof is now complete.
