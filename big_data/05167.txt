A SHARP COUNTEREXAMPLE TO LOCAL

EXISTENCE OF LOW REGULARITY SOLUTIONS TO
EINSTEIN’S EQUATIONS IN WAVE COORDINATES.

BORIS ETTINGER AND HANS LINDBLAD

1. Introduction

The Einstein vacuum equations Rµν = 0 in wave coordinates be-
comes a system on nonlinear wave equations, called the reduced Ein-
stein equations

e(cid:3)ggµν = Fµν(g)[∂g, ∂g].

The metric in addition is assumed to satisfy the wave coordinate con-
dition

∂α(cid:0)p|g|gαβ(cid:1) = 0,

where

|g| = | det(cid:0)∂g/∂x(cid:1)|,

which is preserved by the reduced equations if its satisﬁed initially and
if data satisﬁes the so called constraint equations. Here Fµν(g)[∂g, ∂g]
are quadratic forms in ∂g with coeﬃcients depending on g and the
reduced wave operator is given by

(1.0.1)

(1.0.2)

(1.0.3)

e(cid:3)g = gαβ∂α∂β.

We are considering the initial value problem with low regularity data.

Given initial data in Sobolev spaces H s;

(1.0.4)
we are asking for which s we can obtain a local solution in H s, i.e.

g(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0 = g0 ∈ H s,

g(t, ·) ∈ H s,

∂tg(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0 = g1 ∈ H s−1

∂tg(t, ·) ∈ H s−1,

0 ≤ t ≤ T,

(1.0.5)

for some T > 0, given that initial data satisfy the constraint equations
and the wave coordinate condition. In 1952 Choquet-Bruhat proved
that this is true for large s. More recently Klainerman-Rodinianski
[KR] respectively Smith-Tataru [ST] proved local existence in H s, for
s > 2 for Einstein’s equations in wave coordinates. The result in [ST]
is in fact for more general quasilinear equations of the above form (see
also a recent work of Wang [W]). Moreover, Klainerman-Rodnianski-
Szeftel [KRS] recently proved that one has local existence of bounded
curvature solutions to Einstein’s equations if the curvature is bounded
initially. However, that does not imply existence in wave coordinates.

BORIS ETTINGER AND HANS LINDBLAD

We in fact show that one do not in general have local existence in

H 2 for Einstein’s equations in wave coordinates:

Theorem 1.1. For any ε > 0 there is domain of dependence D and a
smooth solution to Einstein’s equations equations in wave coordinates
in D such that

(1.0.6)

kg(0, ·) − mkH 2(D0) + k∂tg(0, ·)kH 1(D0) ≤ ε,

where m is the Minkowski metric, but for any t > 0

(1.0.7)

kg(t, ·)kH 2(Dt) + k∂tg(t, ·)kH 1(Dt) = ∞,

where Dt = {x; (t, x) ∈ D}. Moreover the curvature tensor satisﬁes

(1.0.8)

kR(t, ·)kL2(Dt) ≤ Cε,

for any t. (Here domain of dependence is an open subset of the upper
half space such that the backward light cone from any point in it is also
contained in it.)

Remark. By a recent result Czimek [C] data as above can be extended
to data on R3 in H 2 satisfying the constraint equations and the wave
coordinate condition.

To put the result in the theorem in context we recall that it in
Lindblad [L1, L2] counterexamples to local existence in H 2 where given
for the semi-linear equation

(1.0.9)

(cid:3)φ = (Lφ)2
respectively for the quasi-linear equation
(cid:3)φ = φ L2φ

(1.0.10)

where L = ∂t − ∂x1. The counterexample for the semi-linear equation
is much stronger and the quasi-linear counterexample is just due to
concentration of characteristics. On the other hand it was shown in
Klainerman-Machedon [KM] that there is local existence H s, for any
s > 3/2, for systems that satisfy the null condition, in particular for

(1.0.11)

(cid:3)φ = (∂tφ)2 − |∇xφ|2.

Einstein’s equations in wave coordinates do not satisfy the null condi-
tion. However as was shown in Lindblad-Rodnianski [LR] it satisfy a
weak null condition in a null frame and the semi-linear terms can be
modelled by the system

(1.0.12)

(cid:3)φ2 = −(Lφ1)2,

(cid:3)φ1 = 0

that satisfy the weak null condition. The same argument used to give
a counterexample for the systems (1.0.9) and (1.0.10) in H 2 also gives
a counterexample in H 2 for the model problem (1.0.12):

Proposition 1.2. For any ε > 0 there is a smooth solution φ = (φ1, φ2)
to (1.0.12) in D = {(t, x); (x1 − 1)2 + x2

3 < (1 − t)2} such that

2 + x2

(1.0.13)

kφ(0, ·)kH 2(D0) + k∂tφ(0, ·)kH 1(D0) ≤ ε

but for any t > 0

(1.0.14)

kφ(t, ·)kH 2(Dt) + k∂tφ(t, ·)kH 1(Dt) = ∞,

where Dt = {x; (t, x) ∈ D}. Moreover the data can be extended so that

(1.0.15)

kφ(0, ·)kH 2(R3) + k∂tφ(0, ·)kH 1(R3) . ε.

The proof of this is by ﬁnding explicit solutions of the system de-
pending on (t, x1) only inside the domain of dependence D, that satisfy
the conditions. Its easy to check that for any function χ1,

φ1(t, x) = χ1(x1 − t),

φ2(t, x) = −tχ2(x1 − t)

solves the system if

Expressing this in a nullframe L = ∂t+∂x1, L = ∂t−∂x1, A, B = ∂x2, ∂x3:

(1.0.19)

(1.0.20)

e(cid:3)ggT U ∼ 0, T ∈ {L, A, B}, U ∈ {L, L, A, B},
e(cid:3)ggLL ∼ P (∂Lg, ∂Lg).

wave coordinate condition reads

(1.0.23)

∂LgLL ∼ 0,

∂LgL2 ∼ 0,

∂LgL3 ∼ 0,

∂L(g22 + g33) ∼ 0

which implies that

(1.0.24)

P (∂Lg, ∂Lg) ∼ −

Consistent with this we choose

2(cid:0)(∂Lg22)2 + (∂Lg33)2 + 2(∂Lg23)2(cid:1)

(1.0.25)

and

(1.0.26)

g22 = 1 + χ1(x1 − t),

g33 = 1 − χ1(x1 − t)

g23 = gL2 = gL3 = 0,

These components solves the homogeneous wave equations (1.0.19). In
order to also solve the remaining wave equation (1.0.20) we must have

(1.0.27)

gLL = −tχ2(x1 − t).

In order to satisfy the remaining wave coordinate condition for gLL we
must have

(1.0.28)

∂LgLL − 2δAB∂AgBL = 0.

To satisfy this we ﬁnally deﬁne

(1.0.29)

gBL = −

xBχ2(x1 − t),

which also satisfy the wave equation (1.0.19).

Based on the above linearized approximation we make the nonlinear

ansatz in the table below with ˜χ2 a modiﬁcation of χ2:

This modiﬁcation is obtained by trying to modify the metric above
in order for it to satisfy the nonlinear wave coordinate condition. The
reason this can be done is that we ﬁrst choose the metric so that det g =

1, in which the wave coordinate condition becomes a linear equation
for the inverse of the metric

∂µgµν = ∂LgLν + ∂LgLν + ∂1g1ν + ∂2g2ν = 0,
solved in the same way we solved the linearized equation.

As it turns out with a metric in of the form in the table the only
nonvanishing component of the curvature tensor is RALBL 6= 0 and
with ˜χ2 satisfying

2 − 2(χ′
˜χ′

1)2(1 + χ1)−2 − ˜χ2

2/16 = 0,

we have that the Ricci curvature RLL = gABRALBL = 0.

In the quasilinear case the domain has to be opened up slightly away
from the characteristic t = x1, x2 = x3 = 0, to make sure the boundary
of the domain is non-time like and hence a domain of dependence. Since
the metric is a small perturbation of the Minkowski metric in L∞ the
light cones are close to those of Minkowski and we only have to insure
that the boundary is non time like. Let D be the domain
(1.0.30) D = {(t, x); (x1 − 1)2H(x1 − 1) + x2
where H(x1 − 1) = 1, when x1 < 1 and H(x1 − 1) = 1/4, when x1 > 1.
The boundary consist of two parts C = C1 ∪ C2, where
(1.0.31) C1 = {(t, x); x1 < 1, (x1 − 1)2 + x2
and
3/4 < (1 − t)2}.
(1.0.32) C2 = {(t, x); x1 ≥ 1, (x1 − 1)2/4 + x2
C2 is clearly non time like as is C1 when x2
3 ≥ c > 0 since this
is true for the Minkowski metric with some room. In null coordinates
u = (t − x1)/2, v = (t + x1)/2, C1 is given by

3/4 < (1 − t)2},

The conormal is given by

n = 2(1 − t)dt − 2(1 − x1)dx1 + x2dx2/2 + x3dx3/2.

(2.1.2)

β = 0, . . . , 3.

Denote the reduced wave operator by

∂α(p|g| gαβ) = 0,

and let hαβ = gαβ−mαβ, and m is the Minkowski metric. Then by [LR]
we have

e(cid:3) = gαβ∂α∂β,

(2.1.3)

where F is a quadratic form in ∂h with coeﬃcients depending on h:

Fµν(h)(∂h, ∂h) = P (∂µh, ∂νh) + Qµν(∂h, ∂h) + Gµν(h)(∂h, ∂h).

e(cid:3)ghµν = Fµν(h)(∂h, ∂h),

where the indices are raised with respect to the Minkowski metric, Qµν
is a linear combinations of the standard null-forms and Gµν contains
only cubic terms. We want to construct a counter example to local
existence in H 2. First by [KM] semilinear equations satisfying the
classical nullcondition have local existence in H 2, so we can neglect
these terms in a heuristic argument. The counterexamples we construct
below will be singular along a light ray in such a way that h vanishes
exactly at the light cone and therefore |Gµν| . |h| |∂h|2 will actually
be more regular than |∂h|2, so also this term can be neglected in the
heuristic argument. The counter example we construct will inside a
light cone be a a function of (t, x1) only with a singularity along t−x1 =
0, but more regular in the t + x1 direction and we therefore expect the
derivatives in the t − x1 direction to be worse than derivatives in the
other directions so expanding the metric in a null frame L = ∂t + ∂1,
L = ∂t −∂1, A, B = ∂2, ∂3, we see that ∂µ is to leading order 1
2Lµ∂L. We
have gαβ = mαβ −hαβ +O(h2), where hαβ = maµmβνhµν and hαβ∂α∂β is
to leading order hLL∂2
L, where hLL = hαβLαLβ. Similarly P (∂µh, ∂µh)
is to leading order given by LµLνP (∂Lh, ∂Lh)/4. Hence expanding h in
a null frame hU V = hµνU µU ν, the reduced Einstein equations become
to highest order

The system simpliﬁes further because as we shall see next the wave

∂LhLL ∼ 0,

∂LhL2 ∼ 0,

∂L(h22 + h33) ∼ 0

2.2. Illoposedness for the model problem. Consider the following
semilinear system:

(2.2.1)

,

(cid:3)φ1 = 0,

where L = ∂t − ∂x1.

(cid:3)φ2 = −(cid:0)Lφ1(cid:1)2

Our ﬁrst result using the techniques from [L1] is illposedness for this

system:

Lemma 2.1. Let ǫ > 0 and set

χ1(x1) =Z x1

0

ǫ| log |s/4||α ds,

0 < α < 1/2.

There is Ψ1 ∈ H 2(R3) such that

Ψ1(x) = χ(x1),

and

in B0 = {x ∈ R3; (x1 − 1)2 + x2

3 < 1}

supp Ψ1 ⊂ {x; |x| ≤ 2} and singsupp Ψ1 = {0}.

There is Ψ2t ∈ ˙H 1(R3) such that

Ψ2t(x) = χ2(x1 − t)

in Bt = {x ∈ R3; (x1 − 1)2 + x2

3 < (1 − t)2}.

For 0 ≤ t < 1 we have

Hence kΨ1k ˙H 2(B0) ≤ Cαǫ and it follows from extension theorems in
Stein[S], (see page 181) that it can be extended to a function in H 2(R3)
with comparable norm. Moreover, the extension can be chosen to sat-
isfy the above support and singular support properties.

The data we will choose for (1.1) are

φ1(0, x) = Ψ1(x),

∂tφ1(0, x) = −∂x1Ψ1(x).

Note now, that by a domain of dependency argument the solution of
(1.1) inside the cone Λ = {(t, x); |x − (1, 0, 0)| ≤ 1 − t, t ≥ 0}, only
depend on the data inside the ball B0. Since data inside the ball B0
only depends on x1, the solution φ1 inside Λ satisfy

(∂x1 − ∂t)(∂t + ∂x1)φ1(t, x1) = 0.

It follows that (∂t + ∂x1)φ1 = 0 in Λ and hence

φ1(t, x1) = χ1(x1 − t),

(t, x) ∈ Λ.

Hence

(∂x1 − ∂t)(∂t + ∂x1)φ2(t, x1) = −(cid:16)(∂x1 − ∂t)φ1(t, x1)(cid:17)2

We now choose data

= −4χ′

1(x1 − t)2.

φ2(0, x) = 0,

∂tφ2(0, x) = −Ψ20(x).

It then follows that in Λ

φ2(t, x) = −tχ2(x1 − t).

Hence by the estimate in the lemma

kφ2(t, ·)kH 2 = ∞,

if 0 < t < 1.

On the other hand it easily follows from standard Strichartz estimates
that

kφ2(t, ·)kH 2−δ < ∞,

if

δ > 0.

2.3. The wave coordinate condition. We prefer to work with lower
indices since the nonlinearity is more transparent in this case. We
collect two standard linear algebra results about the derivative of the
determinant of a matrix and the inverse of a matrix:

Lemma 2.2. Let |g| = | det g |. We have

(2.3.1)

(2.3.2)

∂α|g| = |g| gµν ∂αgµν,
∂αgµν = −gµµ1 gνν1 ∂αgν1µ1.

We convert the constraint equations

using the Lemma above. We get

∂α(p|g| gαβ) = 0,
−p|g| gαα1gββ1∂αgα1β1 +

β = 0, . . . , 3,

gαβp|g| gµν∂αgµν = 0.

Apply gβγ, divide byp|g| and relabel the indices (α → µ, α1 → ν), to

arrive at:

− gµν∂µgνγ +

which is the form that we will use.

gµν ∂γgµν = 0,

tion:

Deﬁne the basis (null frame) by

In the ﬁrst two equations, hLL coeﬃcient cancels and therefore, we can
write the linearized wave coordinate condition as follows:

(2.3.6a)

(2.3.6b)

(2.3.6c)

∂LhLL − 2δAB∂AhBL + ∂L(cid:0)δABhAB(cid:1) = 0,
∂LhLL − 2δAB∂AhBL + ∂L(cid:0)δABhAB(cid:1) = 0,
∂LhLC + ∂LhLC − 2δAB∂AhBC + ∂C(cid:0)−hLL + δABhAB(cid:1) = 0.

Recall that our solution is

hAB ∼ φ1,
hL L ∼ φ2,

where φ1 ∼ χ1(x1 − t) and φ2 ∼ −tχ2(x1 − t) inside the cone |x| ≤ 1 − t
with φ1 ∈ H 2 while φ2 ∈ H 2−δ \ H 2.

2.3.1. Eliminating truly bad parts. We would like to eliminate the com-
ponents that are diﬀerentiated by L in (2.3.6a)-(2.3.6c) as they wouldn’t
have the same regularity as derivatives of L, A. Therefore, identifying
these terms in (2.3.6a)-(2.3.6c), respectively, we set

(2.3.7)

(2.3.8)

(2.3.9)

hLL = 0,

δABhAB = h22 + h33 = 0,

hLC = 0.

We can’t set hAB = 0 but it is enough to have

(2.3.10)

h22 = −h33 = φ1,
h23 = 0,

2.3.2. Satisfying the ﬁrst linearized wave coordinate condition (2.3.6a).
With (2.3.7),(2.3.8),(2.3.9), the ﬁrst constraint is satisﬁed automati-
cally.

2.3.3. Satisfying the second linearized wave coordinate condition (2.3.6b).
With the choice hAB as in (2.3.10), the constraint (2.3.6b) becomes

∂LhLL − 2δAB∂AhBL = 0.

Since ∂LhLL = −tχ2 inside the cone, this suggests to deﬁne

Observe that xBφ2 ∈ H 2 as near the singular point x1 = t of φ2, inside
the cone, we have |xB| . x

∂AhBC = 0,

∂LhBL = 0

by (2.3.11). Combining this with (2.3.7),(2.3.9), we see that the last
constraint (2.3.6c) is reduced to

3. The solution inside the cone

The goal of this section is to build on the ideas of Section 2 to obtain a
solution of the Einstein equations inside the cone and wave coordinates
for it, such that the metric in these coordinates has a ﬁnite H 2 norm
at time zero and inﬁnite at all other times. For this end, let D be the
domain
(3.0.12) D = {(t, x); (x1 − 1)2H(x1 − 1) + x2
where H(x1 − 1) = 1, when x1 < 1 and H(x1 − 1) = 1/4, when x1 > 1.
Set Dt = {x; (t, x) ∈ D}. Our goal is to prove the following statement.

3/4 < (1 − t)2},

2/4 + x2

Theorem 3.1. There exist a space time (D, g) and coordinates xα :
D → R, α = 0, 1, 2, 3 such that

• The metric g satisﬁes the Einstein vacuum equation

Ric(g) = 0,

on D.

• The coordinates xα are wave coordinates

∂α(p|g|gαβ) = 0,

on D β = 0, 1, 2, 3.

• The metric g has ﬁnite initial data in H 2(D0) × H 1(D0):

kgαβkH 2(D0) + k∂tgαβkH 1(D0) < ∞, α, β ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}.
• The H 2(Dt) norm of g00 at any other time t is inﬁnite:

kg00kH 2(Dt) = ∞,

∀t ∈ (−1, 1) \ {0}.

COUNTEREXAMPLE TO LOCAL EXISTENCE FOR EINSTEIN’S EQ.

We prove the the theorem by describing an explicit example for such
a metric g and coordinates xα. The coordinates xα are the standard
coordinates on R1+3

xα((y0, y1, y2, y3)) = δβ

αyβ.

We will also write t = x0 We use the rest of this section to specify g
and verify that the hypotheses of Theorem 3.1 are satisﬁed. We deﬁne
the following vector ﬁelds:

(3.0.13)

L = ∂t + ∂x1,
L = ∂t − ∂x1.

We complete {L, L} to a basis by adding ∂A = ∂xA, A = 2, 3. In what
follows we will use A, B to denote an index from a set {2, 3}. Since
L, L are constant coeﬃcient vector ﬁelds, we will abuse the notation and
treat L, L as ﬁctitious indices as well. For example ∂Lf = ∂tf + ∂x1f
or gLL = hL, Lig.

Remark. Since {L, L, ∂A|A = 2, 3} forms a basis and have constant
coeﬃcient we use this basis instead of the standard one in all subsequent
derivations.

We can now specify the metric.

Deﬁnition 3.2. The nonzero coeﬃcients of the metric g in the basis
{L, L, ∂2, ∂3} are as follows
(3.0.14)

(3.0.15)

(3.0.16)

where

gLL = −2

with χ1 was deﬁned in Lemma 2.1, ˜χ2 - a slight modiﬁcation of χ2 and
will be deﬁned in Lemma 3.3 below and

The rest of coeﬃcients are given by symmetry.

χ2A = χ1A ˜χ2.

Remark. Unless we specify otherwise, the argument of the χ-functions
will be x1 − t.

The coeﬃcients of g are summarized in Table 1 below. Thus we

reduce the proof of Theorem 3.1 to the following three Lemmas

standard coordinates satisfy the wave coordinate condition (2.1.2).

Lemma 3.5. The metric g in Deﬁnition 3.2 satisﬁes

straightforward observation

whereas ΓLLL = ΓLLL = ΓLLL = 0 and

With the convention (3.0.18), we have the following formula for the
curvature (see also [LR, 3.10]):

We will split the curvatures into two non-tensors, which represent the
linear and the quadratic parts

Rµανβ = Rlin
Rlin
Rquad

µανβ = ∂βΓµαν − ∂νΓµαβ,
µανβ = gλγΓνλαΓµγβ − gλγΓαλβΓµγν.

ALBL and Rquad

We claim that the only nontrivial components of the non-tensors Rlin, Rquad
are Rlin
ALBL. In fact this follows from the symmetries if we
can show that they vanish if at least one index is L or at least three
index are A, B, C. For Rlin
ALBL the ﬁrst follows since the only compo-
nents of ∂βΓµαν with at least one L are ∂LΓLLL, ∂LΓLLL = ∂LΓLLL
and ∂LΓLLL but they are seen to cancell each other when appearing in
Rlin. Secondly ΓABC = 0 and ∂AΓBCL = ∂AΓLCB = 0 and ∂AΓBLC = 0
which concludes the proof of the statement for Rlin. For Rquad the ﬁrst
follows since the only combination of gλγΓνλαΓµγβ with one index L
say ν = L, is gLLΓLLLΓLLL which will cancell when appearing in Rquad.
Secondly if three of the indeces of gλγΓνλαΓµγβ are A, B, C say ν = A
and α = B and β = C then in fact gLLΓALBΓµLC = 0 which concludes
the proof of the claim.

Proof of Lemma 3.4. Since p|g| is constant by item 1 of Claim 3.6,

we use some elementary linear algebra to rewrite the wave coordinate
condition (2.1.2) as

(cid:3)

(3.0.20)

Denote

gµν∂µgνγ = 0,

γ = 0, .., 3.

dγ = gµν∂µgµγ.

Instead, we will show
Our goal is to show dγ = 0 for γ = 0, ..3.
dL = dL = dA = 0 for A = 2, 3, which is equivalent since L, L, A form
a basis of constant coeﬃcient vector ﬁelds. The fact that dL = 0 is
obvious, since the metric coeﬃcients of the form gXL are constant. For
dL, we write

dL =gLL∂LgLL + gLL∂LgLL + gLA∂LgAL

+ gLL∂LgLL + gAL∂AgLL + gAB∂AgBL

Since coeﬃcients gXL are constant, we drop their derivatives

dL = gLL∂LgLL + gLA∂LgAL + gAB∂AgBL.

Observe that ∂LgAL = 1

4∂L(xAχ2A(x1 − t)) = 0. Therefore

dL = gLL∂LgLL + gAB∂AgBL

since ∂L(t ˜χ2(x1 − t)) = ˜χ2(x1 − t). Lastly

dA =gLL∂LgLA + gLL∂LgLA + gLB∂LgAB

+ gLL∂LgLA + gBL∂BgLA + gBC∂BgCA.

We drop derivatives of the constant coeﬃcients gXL

dA = gLL∂LgLA + gLB∂LgAB + gBC∂BgCA.

18

BORIS ETTINGER AND HANS LINDBLAD

Next, observe that gLA depends only on x1 − t and xA, thus ∂LgLA = 0.
Similarly gAB depends only on x1 − t, therefore ∂LgAB = 0. Similarly,
gCA depends only on t − x1 and therefore ∂BgCA = 0. Thus we arrive
at the conclusion

dA = 0,

which completes the proof.

(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 3.5. The function χ1 has been analyzed in Lemma 2.1.
Thus, to prove the lemma, it is enough to establish the following:

˜χ2 ∈ H 1(Dt) \ H 2(Dt),

t ∈ [0, 1]

xA ˜χ2 ∈ H 2(D0), A = 2, 3.

Recall that ˜χ2 satisﬁes

˜χ2 = 2(χ′

˜χ2(x)2.

We choose ˜χ2(0) = 0 then by integrating (3.0.21), we can show that
˜χ2 is bounded by 2 for |y| ≤ 1 if we adjust ǫ in the deﬁnition of χ1, so
1)2 ≤ 1 and apply the bootstrap assumption ˜χ2 ≤ 4 for the
2 ∈ L2(D0).

To show that ˜χ′′

˜χ′′
2 = 2(χ′

1(y))2(1 + χ2

where F will have a smooth dependance on χ1, ˜χ2 and polynomial in
χ′
1, ˜χ′

2 ∈ Lp for any p < ∞, we conclude that

2. Since χ′

kF (χ1, χ′

2)kL2 ≤ C < ∞

Also since χ1 is bounded, we can bound (1 + χ1(y))−2 ≥ c > 0. There-
fore, applying the same logic as in Lemma 2.1, we will arrive at

Thus it remains to show that xA ˜χ2 ∈ H 2(B0). Without loss of gen-

4. Taking into account the bending of the light cones

To take into account the bending of the light cones in the metric
when need to open up our domain slight to ensure its space like or
null. We will therefore replace our domain. Let D be the domain

(4.0.23) D = {(t, x); (x1 − 1)2H(x1 − 1) + x2

2/4 + x2

3/4 < (1 − t)2}

where H(x1 − 1) = 1, when x1 < 1 and H(x1 − 1) = 1/4, when x1 > 1.
The boundary consist of two parts C = C1 ∪ C2, where

(4.0.24) C1 = {(t, x); x1 < 1, (x1 − 1)2 + x2

2/4 + x2

3/4 < (1 − t)2},

and

(4.0.25) C2 = {(t, x); x1 ≥ 1, (x1 − 1)2/4 + x2

2/4 + x2

3/4 < (1 − t)2}.

A conormal to C1 is given by

n = 2(1 − t)dt − 2(1 − x1)dx1 + x2dx2/2 + x3dx3/2,

or expressed in the L, L, A, B coordinates u = (t − x1)/2 and v =
(t + x1)/2

n = 4(1 − v)du − 4udv + x2dx2/2 + x3dx3/2.

gαβN αN β ≤ 0,

with equality only if u = 0. This proves that C1 is space like apart
from when u = 0 where its null.
