Abstract

A feedback vertex set of a graph is a subset of vertices intersecting all cycles. We
provide tight upper bounds on the size of a minimum feedback vertex set in planar
graphs of girth at least ﬁve. We prove that if G is a connected planar graph of girth
at least ﬁve on n vertices and m edges, then G has a feedback vertex set of size at
most 2m−n+2
. By Euler’s formula, this implies that G has a feedback vertex set of
5 and n−2
3 . These results not only improve a result of Dross, Montassier
size at most m
and Pinlou and conﬁrm the girth-5 case of one of their conjectures, but also make the
best known progress towards a conjecture of Kowalik, Luˇzar and ˇSkrekovski and solves
the subcubic case of their conjecture. An important step of our proof is providing an
upper bound on the size of minimum feedback vertex sets of subcubic graphs with girth
at least ﬁve with no induced subdivision of members of a ﬁnite family of non-planar
graphs.

Introduction

In this paper, graphs are simple. A feedback vertex set of a graph G is a set S ⊆ V (G) such
that G − S is a forest. We deﬁne φ(G) to be the minimum size of a feedback vertex set of
a graph G. Feedback vertex sets have been extensive studied. For example, given a planar
graph G and an integer k, deciding if φ(G) ≤ k is one of Karp’s original NP-complete
problems [5].

A direction in the study of feedback vertex sets is to ﬁnd an upper bound on the
minimum size of a feedback vertex set. An old conjecture due to Albertson and Berman
[1] states that every planar graph on n vertices has a feedback vertex set of size at most n
2 .
This conjecture, if true, implies that every planar graph on n vertices has an independent

set of size at most n
4 . This bound for the independent set is an immediate corollary of the
Four Color Theorem, but it is the only proof in the literature. Albertson and Berman’s
conjecture remains open. The best known result is that every planar graph G on n vertices
has a feedback vertex set with size at most 3n
5 , due to Borodin’s acyclic 5-coloring theorem
[2].

The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle. (If the graph has no cycle, then
its girth is inﬁnity.) Recently, the minimum size of feedback vertex sets of planar graphs
with girth at least ﬁve has attracted attention. Kowalik et al. [7] proposed the following
conjecture, which is tight as the dodecahedron attains the bound.

Conjecture 1.1 ([7]). If G is a planar graph of girth at least ﬁve on n vertices , then
φ(G) ≤ 3n
10 .

Dross et al. [3] proved that if G is a planar graph of girth at least ﬁve with m edges,
23 . Note that every planar graph on n vertices with girth at least ﬁve has
3 (n − 2) edges by Euler’s formula. So every planar graph with girth at least ﬁve

then φ(G) ≤ 5m
at most 5
on n vertices has a feedback vertex set of size at most 25n−50

.

In a companion paper, Dross et al. [4] made the following conjecture.

69

Conjecture 1.2 ([4]). If G is a planar graph of girth at least g with m edges, then φ(G) ≤
m
g .

In this paper, we prove the following.

Theorem 1.3. If G is a connected planar graph of girth at least ﬁve on n vertices and m
edges, then φ(G) ≤ 2m−n+2

.

A graph is subcubic if every vertex has degree at most three. It is easy to see that every
2 edges. Together with the fact that every
3 (n − 2) edges, the following

subcubic graph on n vertices has at most 3n
planar graph on n vertices with girth at least ﬁve has at most 5
are immediate corollaries of Theorem 1.3.

Corollary 1.4. Let G be a graph on n vertices and m edges.

1. If G is a planar graph with girth at least ﬁve, then φ(G) ≤ m

5 , and φ(G) ≤ n−2
3 .

2. If G is a planar subcubic graph with girth at least ﬁve, then φ(G) ≤ 3n
10 .

3. If G is a connected planar subcubic graph with girth at least ﬁve, then φ(G) ≤ 2n+2

7

.

The ﬁrst statement of Corollary 1.4 improves the result of Dross et al. about Conjecture
1.1 mentioned earlier and solves Conjecture 1.2 for the case g = 5. The second or the third
statement of Corollary 1.4 solves Conjecture 1.1 for the case when G is subcubic. Note
that the dodecahedron attains the bound in Theorem 1.3.

Our strategy for proving Theorem 1.3 is ﬁrst proving the case when G is a subcubic
graph, and then boosting it to the general case. In fact, instead of proving the subcubic
case of Theorem 1.3, we will prove a stronger result: the planarity will be replaced by the
property of the lack of induced subdivision of graphs in a ﬁnite family of non-planar graphs.
We say that a graph G contains an induced subdivision of another graph H if G contains an
induced subgraph that can be obtained from H by repeatedly subdividing edges. Notice
that we can obtain inﬁnitely many non-planar cubic graphs where all proper induced
subgraphs are planar by taking K3,3 and repeatedly picking a vertex, subdividing all edges
incident with it, and then applying a Y-∆ transformation on it. So unlike the minor relation
or the subdivision relation, there is no Kuratowski-type theorem for planarity with respect
to the induced subdivision relation, even if we restrict the problem to subcubic graphs.

Furthermore, in order to make the induction go through, we relax the girth condition
to allow the existence of short cycles, but we do not allow two disjoint short cycles. The
following is our result about subcubic graphs. The family F and the function r mentioned
in the description will be explicitly described in this paper.

Theorem 1.5. There exists a ﬁnite family F of non-planar 2-connected subcubic graphs
and a function r such that if G is a connected subcubic graph with no two disjoint cycles
of length less than ﬁve and G does not contain an induced subdivision of a member of F ,
then φ(G) ≤ 2|E(G)|−|V (G)|+2

+ r(G), and r(G) satisﬁes the following.

7

1. r(G) ≤ 4
7 .

2. If G 6= K4, then r(G) ≤ 3

7 ; if r(G) = 3

7 , then G contains a triangle.

3. If r(G) > 0 and G is 2-connected, then for all e ∈ E(G), φ(G−e) ≤ 2|E(G)|−|V (G)|−5

+

7

r(G).

4. If G is planar and has girth at least ﬁve, then r(G) = 0.

The proof of Theorem 1.5 requires explicit descriptions of the family F and the function
r. However, proving the general case is relatively simple as long as the subcubic case is
established. In Section 2, we show how to prove Theorem 1.3 assuming that Theorem 1.5
is proved. In Section 3, we explicitly deﬁne the function r. In Section 4, we complete the
paper by proving Theorem 1.5. The proof of Theorem 1.5 will extensively use strategies
in one of our earlier papers [6].

Here are some notions that will be frequently used in this paper. Let G be a graph
and X a subset of V (G). We deﬁne G[X] to be the subgraph induced on X, and we
deﬁne G − X to be the subgraph induced on V (G) − X. When X consists of one vertex,
say v, then we also denote G − X by G − v. A vertex v in a graph G is a cut-vertex if
G − v has more connected components than G. Similarly, an edge e in G is a cut-edge if
G − e has more connected components than G, where G − e is the subgraph of G obtained
from G by deleting the edge e. For a positive integer k, a graph is k-connected if it has

3

at least k + 1 vertices and G − Y is connected for every subset Y of V (G) with size at
most k; a graph is k-edge-connected if G − Y is connected for every subset Y of E(G) of
size at most k. A block of G is a maximal connected subgraph without a cut-vertex. A
block is nontrivial if it is not isomorphic to K1 or K2. Note that every non-trivial block is
2-connected and has minimum degree at least two. So in a subcubic graph, every pair of
nontrivial blocks is disjoint. An end-block of G is a block containing at most one cut-vertex
of G. Note also that every non-2-connected graph on at least three vertices contains at
least two end-blocks. For a pair of non-adjacent vertices x, y of G, we deﬁne G + xy to be
the graph obtained from G by adding the edge xy. For a family W of multigraphs, we say
that a multigraph G is W-free if it does not contain any induced subgraph isomorphic to
a member of W.

2 Reducing Theorem 1.3 to subcubic graphs

In this section, we prove Theorem 1.3, assuming Theorem 1.5.

Proof of Theorem 1.3 assuming Theorem 1.5. In the rest of this section, G denotes
a minimum counterexample to Theorem 1.3. That is, G is connected, planar and of girth
at least ﬁve with φ(G) > 2|E(G)|−|V (G)|+2
, but for every connected planar graph H with
girth at least ﬁve with |V (H)| + |E(H)| < |V (G)| + |E(G)|, φ(H) ≤ 2|E(H)|−|V (H)|+2
. We
denote |V (G)| and |E(G)| by n and m, respectively.

Since every graph in the family F mentioned in Theorem 1.5 is non-planar, G does not
contain an induced subdivision of a member of F. Hence G contains a vertex of degree at
least four by Theorem 1.5. In particular, G contains at least ﬁve vertices.

Claim 2.1. G is 2-edge-connected.

Proof. Suppose to the contrary that e ∈ E(G) is a cut-edge, and G − e has components
G1 and G2. By the minimality of G, for i = 1, 2, Gi admits a feedback vertex set Si of
size at most 2|E(Gi)|−|V (Gi)|+2
. Then S1 ∪ S2 is a feedback vertex set of G of size at most
2(|E(G1)|+|E(G2)|)−(|V (G1)|+|V (G2)|)+4

Claim 2.2. G has maximum degree four, and every vertex of degree four is a cut-vertex.

Proof. Let v ∈ V (G) has degree at least four. Denote the degree of v by d(v). Let
G1, . . . , Gk be the components of G − v. Since G is 2-edge-connected, k ≤ ⌊ d(v)
2 ⌋. By
the minimality of G, for i = 1, . . . , k, Gi admits a feedback vertex set Si of size at most
2|E(Gi)|−|V (Gi)|+2

7

By Claim 2.2, G is not 2-connected and contains at least ﬁve vertices. So G has at
least two end-blocks. Let B be an end-block of G. Let nB = |V (B)| and mB = |E(B)|.
Since B is an end-block of G, B contains a unique v ∈ V (G) such that v is a cut-vertex in
G. Since G is 2-edge-connected, v has degree four in G and has precisely two neighbors,
denoted by v1 and v2, in B. Note that B is 2-connected, so B is subcubic by Claim 2.2.
Furthermore, v1 is not adjacent to v2, otherwise vv1v2v is a triangle in G, a contradiction.
Let B′ = G[V (B) − {v}] + v1v2. Since B has girth at least ﬁve, every cycle in B′ of
length less than ﬁve contains v1v2, so B′ does not contain disjoint cycles of length less than
ﬁve. Since B′ is subcubic, by Theorem 1.5, B′ admits a feedback vertex set S1 of size at
most

2(mB − 1) − (nB − 1) + 2

Let G′ = G − (V (B) − {v}). By the minimality of G, G′ admits a feedback vertex set

S2 of size at most

2(m − mB) − (n − nB + 1) + 2

2(m − mB) − (n − nB) + 1

Therefore S1 ∪ S2 is a feedback vertex set of G of size at most 2m−n+2
+ r(B′). Since G is
a counterexample, r(B′) > 0. Since B′ is 2-connected, by Theorem 1.5, B′ − v1v2 admits
+ r(B′). Since there are only two edges
a feedback vertex set S′
between v and G − V (B), and G is 2-edge-connected, G − V (B) is connected. By the
minimality of G, G − V (B) admits a feedback vertex set S′

2 ∪ {v} is a feedback vertex set of G of size at most 2m−n

Therefore, S′
7 + r(B′). So
r(B′) > 2
7 . By Theorem 1.5, either B′ = K4 or B′ contains a triangle. Note that B′ − v1v2
has girth at least ﬁve, but for every edge of K4, there exists a triangle disjoint from it,
so B′
6= K4. Hence B′ contains a triangle. However, B can be obtained from B′ by
subdividing an edge, so B contains a 4-cycle, contradicting that G has girth at least ﬁve.
This proves Theorem 1.3.

3 Error Terms

In this section we will describe the function r mentioned in Theorem 1.5. We shall ﬁrst
deﬁne special families of graphs.

Let G be a graph. For e1, e2 ∈ E(G) (not necessarily distinct) and a ∈ V (G) with
degG(a) = 2, we deﬁne the graph G ◦ (e1, e2, a) to be the graph obtained from G by

5

subdividing e1 and e2 once, respectively, and adding a new vertex adjacent to a and the
two vertices obtained from subdividing e1 and e2. Note that when e1 = e2, it is subdivided
twice.

Deﬁne F1,0 to be the family consisting of the multigraph on one vertex with one loop,
and we deﬁne Fi,j = ∅ if i ≤ 0 or j < 0. For 0 ≤ j ≤ i, we deﬁne Fi,j to be the
set of subcubic multigraphs that can be either obtained from a multigraph in Fi−1,j by
subdividing an edge once or obtained from a graph in Fi,j−1 by taking operation ◦.

In particular, for each i ≥ 1, the unique member in Fi,0 is the cycle of length i; the
unique graph in F1,1 is K4; the unique graph in F2,1 is the graph obtained from K4 by
subdividing an edge, and we denote this graph by K +
4 . Furthermore, there is only one
graph in F3,1 with girth at least four, which is the graph obtained from K4 by subdividing
each edge once in a perfect matching of K4.

Note that every graph in Fi,j has minimum degree at least two for every i, j. Since the
operation ◦ decreases the number of vertices of degree two, for every i, j, Fi,j has exactly
i − j vertices of degree two. Hence every graph in Fi,j is cubic if and only if i = j.

There are two special graphs in F2,2 worth mentioning. One is the cube, denoted by
Q3, which is the planar triangle-free cubic graph obtained from two disjoint cycles of length
four by adding a perfect matching. The other is the Wagner graph, denoted by V8, which
is the cubic graph obtained from the cycle of length eight by adding edges between pairs
of vertices of distance four.

The following are some properties of graphs in the families Fi,j. They can be easily

veriﬁed and we omit the proof.

Lemma 3.1. Let i, j be integers with i ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ j ≤ i. The following holds.

1. Fi,0 consists of the cycle of length i.

2. All members of Fi,j are simple, unless i ∈ {1, 2} and j = 0.

3. F1,1 = {K4}.

4. F2,1 = {K +

4 }.

5. F3,1 consists of three graphs, where each of them is obtained from K4 by either sub-
dividing an edge twice or subdividing two edges once; the graph obtained from K4 by
subdividing the edges of a perfect matching is the only graph in F3,1 with girth at least
four.

6. Every graph in F2,2 contains disjoint cycles of length less than ﬁve; every graph in

F2,2\{Q3, V8} contains a triangle disjoint from a cycle of length at most four.

7. Every graph in F3,2 ∪ F4,1 has girth at most four.

8. If G ∈ Fi,j , then |V (G)| = i + 3j, |E(G)| = i + 5j, and 2|E(G)|−|V (G)|+2

7

= i+2

7 + j.

The following lemmas were proved in one of our earlier papers [6]. They show that if
a graph has the property that deleting an arbitrary set of edges with size at most one can
make the size of the minimum feedback vertex set small, then so is the graph obtained
from it by taking the two operations used for deﬁning the families Fi,j. In particular, they
provide a recurrence relation to upper bound the size of minimum feedback vertex sets of
graphs in Fi,j.

Lemma 3.2 ([6]). Let H be a graph, k ∈ {0, 1}, and let G be obtained from H by subdividing
an edge. If there exists p ∈ R such that φ(H − W ) ≤ p for every W ⊆ E(H) with |W | = k,
then φ(G − W ′) ≤ p for every W ′ ⊆ E(G) with |W ′| = k.

Lemma 3.3 ([6]). Let H be a graph, k ∈ {0, 1}, a ∈ V (H), e1, e2 ∈ E(H), and G =
H ◦ (e1, e2, a). If there exists p ∈ R such that φ(H − W ) ≤ p for every W ⊆ E(H) with
|W | = k, then φ(G − W ′) ≤ p + 1 for every W ′ ⊆ E(G) with |W ′| = k.

Now we are ready to describe the function r mentioned in Theorem 1.5. Let H be a

2-connected graph or a graph on at most two vertices. We deﬁne

ǫ(H) = (cid:26) max{ 5−i

0

7 , 0} if H ∈ Fi,j, i ≥ 1, j ≥ 0,

otherwise.

Let G be a connected multigraph that is either simple or a member of Fi,j for some
nonnegative integers i, j. We deﬁne r(G) to be the sum of ǫ(B) over all blocks B of G if G
is simple; we deﬁne r(G) = ǫ(G) if G ∈ Fi,j for some nonnegative integers i, j. Note that
every simple graph belonging to Fi,j for some i, j is 2-connected, so r is well-deﬁned, and
r(G) = ǫ(G) if G ∈ Fi,j.
Lemma 3.4. If G ∈ Fi,j for some nonnegative integers i, j, then φ(G−e) ≤ 2|E(G)|−|V (G)|+2
ǫ(G) − 1 for every edge e ∈ E(G).

7

+

Proof. We shall prove this lemma by induction on i + j. When i = 1, j = 0, G has only
one edge e, so φ(G − e) = 0 ≤ 2|E(G)|−|V (G)|+2
− 1 + ǫ(G), as desired. Therefore we may
assume that the lemma holds for every pair of i′, j′ with i′ + j′ < i + j.

7

We ﬁrst assume that G is obtained from a multigraph H in Fi−1,j by subdividing an
+ ǫ(H) − 1 for every

edge. By the induction hypothesis, φ(H − f ) ≤ 2|E(H)|−|V (H)|+2
f ∈ E(H). By Lemma 3.2, for every e ∈ E(G),

7

φ(G − e) ≤

as desired.

2|E(H)| − |V (H)| + 2

7

+ ǫ(H) − 1 ≤

2|E(G)| − |V (G)| + 2

7

+ ǫ(G) − 1,

So we may assume that G is obtained from a multigraph H in Fi,j−1 by taking the
+ ǫ(H) − 1 for every

operation ◦. By the induction hypothesis, φ(H − f ) ≤ 2|E(H)|−|V (H)|+2
f ∈ E(H). By Lemma 3.3, for every e ∈ E(G),

7

φ(G − e) ≤

2|E(H)| − |V (H)| + 2

7

2|E(G)| − |V (G)| + 2

7

+ ǫ(G) − 1,

+ ǫ(H) ≤

7

as desired.

Lemma 3.5. If G ∈ Fi,j, then φ(G − v) ≤ 2|E(G)|−|V (G)|+2
+ ǫ(G) − 1 for every vertex
v ∈ V (G). In particular, for every vertex v ∈ V (G), there exists a feedback vertex set S of
G such that v ∈ S and |S| ≤ 2|E(G)|−|V (G)|+2

+ ǫ(G).

7

7

Proof. Let v be a vertex of G and let e be an edge of G incident with v. Then φ(G − v) ≤
φ(G − e) ≤ 2|E(G)|−|V (G)|+2

+ ǫ(G) − 1 by Lemmas 3.4.

7

Lemma 3.6. If Fi,j contains a planar graph with girth at least ﬁve, then i ≥ 5.

Proof. Let G be a planar graph in Fi,j with girth at least ﬁve. By Euler’s formula, |E(G)| ≤
5
3 (|V (G)| − 2). By Lemma 3.1, i + 5j ≤ 5

3 (i + 3j − 2). That is, i ≥ 5.

Now we are ready to prove that r is a function satisﬁes the conditions in Theorem 1.5.

Lemma 3.7. If G is a connected (F4,2 ∪ F4,3)-free subcubic graph with no two disjoint
cycles with length less than ﬁve, then the following hold.

1. r(G) ≤ 4
7 .

2. If G 6= K4, then r(G) ≤ 3

7 ; if r(G) = 3

7 , then G contains a triangle.

3. If r(G) > 0 and G is 2-connected, then for all e ∈ E(G), φ(G − e) ≤ 2m−n−5

7

+ r(G).

4. If G 6∈ F3,3 ∪ F4,4 and has girth at least ﬁve, then r(G) = 0.

Proof. We ﬁrst assume that G is 2-connected or G is an edge. If r(G) > 0, then G ∈ Fi,j
7 . This proves Statement 1. If r(G) ≥ 3
for some i, j with 1 ≤ i ≤ 4. So r(G) ≤ 5−i
7
and G 6= K4, then i = 2, so by Lemma 3.1, either G contains a triangle or G ∈ {Q3, V8}.
But each Q3 and V8 contains two disjoint cycles with length less than ﬁve, so G contains
a triangle. This proves Statement 2. Statement 3 is an immediate consequence of Lemma
3.4. If G 6∈ F3,3 ∪ F4,4 and has girth at least ﬁve, then either G ∈ F4,2 ∪ F4,3 or i ≥ 5
by Lemma 3.1. But G is (F4,2 ∪ F4,3)-free, so r(G) = 0. Hence this lemma holds for
2-connected graphs G or the graph consists of an edge.

7 ≤ 4

Now we assume that G is not 2-connected and G contains at least three vertices. Since
G is subcubic and does not contain two disjoint cycles with length less than ﬁve, there
exists at most one block containing a cycle of length less than ﬁve. If such a block exists,
we denote it by B.

Let D be a block of G such that D has girth at least ﬁve. Suppose ǫ(D) > 0. So
D ∈ Fi,j for some 1 ≤ i ≤ 4, j ≤ i. Since G is not 2-connected, D contains at least one
vertex of degree at most two, so i − j ≥ 1. Since D has girth at least ﬁve, i = 4 and
j ∈ {2, 3} by Lemma 3.1, so ǫ(D) ≤ 1
7 and D isomorphic to a member in F4,2 ∪ F4,3. But
G is (F4,2 ∪ F4,3)-free, a contradiction. So every block D of G with girth ﬁve has ǫ(D) = 0.
Hence, if G has girth at least ﬁve, then r(G) = 0; otherwise, B exists and r(G) = ǫ(B).

8

Since B has at most two vertices or is a 2-connected graph, the lemma holds for B, so
7 , then r(B) = 3
7 ,

7 . And if G 6= K4, then B 6= K4, so r(G) ≤ 3

7 . Finally, if r(G) = 3

r(G) ≤ 4
so B, and hence G, contains a triangle.

The following will be used in Section 4.

Lemma 3.8. Let G be a graph isomorphic to a member of Fi,j for some nonnegative
integers i, j. If G is planar and there exists an edge e of G such that G − e has girth at
least ﬁve, then either i ≥ 4 or j = 0.

Proof. Since G ∈ Fi,j and G is simple, G is 2-connected, so G − e is connected. We may
assume that j > 0. By Lemma 3.1, |E(G − e)| = i + 5j − 1 ≥ i + 3j = |V (G)|, so G − e is
not a tree. Hence every face is incident with all edges of some cycle. Therefore, every face
has length at least ﬁve. By Euler’s formula, |E(G)| − 1 ≤ 5
3 (|V (G)| − 2). By Lemma 3.1,
i + 5j − 1 ≤ 5

3 (i + 3j − 2). Since i is an integer, i ≥ 4.

4 Proof of Theorem 1.5

In this section, we shall prove Theorem 1.5. Let S be the set of graphs H such that
H ∈ F3,2 ∪ F3,3 and there exists an edge e of H such that H − e has girth at least
ﬁve. We deﬁne F to the family of graphs consisting of the members of F4,2 ∪ F4,3 with
girth at least ﬁve and the members of S. Note that every member of F is non-planar
by Lemmas 3.6 and 3.8. To prove Theorem 1.5, by Lemma 3.7, it is suﬃcient to show
that φ(G) ≤ 2|E(G)|+|V (G)|+2
+ r(G) for every connected subcubic graph with no induced
subdivision of members of F and no two disjoint cycles of length less than ﬁve.

7

In the rest of this section, we assume that G is a minimum counterexample. That
is, G is a connected subcubic graph with no induced subdivision of members of F and

Clearly, G is not a tree. So n ≥ 3.

Let nB = |V (B)| and mB = |E(B)|. By the minimality of G, B contains a feedback

Claim 4.2. r(G) = 0.

7

+ r(G), a contradiction.

Proof. By Claim 4.1, r(G) = 0 unless G ∈ Fi,j for some nonnegative integers i, j with
i ≤ 4. But G 6∈ Fi,j for all nonnegative integers i, j with i ≤ 4 by Lemma 3.5.

An edge-cut of G is an ordered partition [A, B] of V (G). The order of [A, B] is the

number of edges with one end in A and one end in B.

Claim 4.3. If [A, B] is an edge-cut of order at most two, then G[A], G[B] /∈ Fi,j for some
integers i, j with 1 ≤ i ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ j ≤ i.

Proof. Suppose to the contrary. By symmetry, we may suppose that G[B] ∈ Fi,j for some
i, j with 1 ≤ i ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ j ≤ i. Since G has no loop or parallel edges, |B| ≥ 2. Since G is
2-connected, [A, B] has order two, so G[B] contains at least two vertices of degree at most
two. So i ≥ 3 and i − j ≥ 2. Let uA, vA be the ends of the edges between A, B in A, and
let uB and vB be the ends of the edges between A, B in B. Note that uB 6= vB as G is 2-
connected. Let nA = |A|, nB = |B|, mA = |E(G[A])| and mB = |E(G[B])|. By Lemma 3.5,
+r(G[B]) = 2mB −nB +2+(5−i)
G[B] has a feedback vertex set SB with size at most 2mB −nB +2
such that uB ∈ SB.

We ﬁrst assume that uA = vA. Since G is 2-connected, nA = 1. Note that SB is a
feedback vertex set of G as uB ∈ SB. Since i ≥ 3, SB is a feedback vertex set of G with
size at most 2m−n+2

By the minimality of G, G[A] admit s feedback vertex set SA of size at most 2mA−nA+2

Since i − j ≥ 2 and G is F4,2-free, we have 3 ≤ i ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ j ≤ 1. By Lemmas 3.1,

G[B] has girth less than ﬁve, so G[A] has girth at least ﬁve.

Since r(G[A]) > 0, G[A] contains a block D ∈ Fs,t for some integers s, t with s ≤ 4.
Since G is 2-connected, D contains at least two vertices of degree at most two, so s − t ≥ 2.
Hence 3 ≤ s ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. By Lemma 3.1, G[A] contains a cycle of length less than
ﬁve, a contradiction. This proves the lemma.

Claim 4.4. If [A, B] is an edge-cut of G of order two, then G[A] is not a cycle.

Proof. Suppose that G[A] is a cycle. Let v be a vertex in A adjacent to some ver-
tex in B. Then G has a feedback vertex set containing {v} with size φ(G[B]) + 1 ≤

and |A| ≥ 5. Hence φ(G) ≤ 2m−n

We say an edge-cut [A, B] is a splitter if it has order at most two with |A| ≥ 2 such
that G[A] has girth at least ﬁve and G[B] is 2-connected. Note that A, B have size greater
than two, so [A, B] has order two and the edges of [A, B] do not share ends, since G is
2-connected. A splitter is tight if there exists no splitter [A′, B′] such that B′ ⊂ B.

Claim 4.5. If [A, B] is a tight splitter of G, then either

1. G[A] is a path,

2. φ(G[A]) ≤ 2|E(A)|−|V (A)|−2

7

.

Proof. Let [A, B] be a tight splitter. Let uA, vA be the ends of the edges between A, B
in A, and let uB and vB be the ends of the edges between A, B in B. Let nA = |A|,
nB = |B|, mA = |E(G[A])| and mB = |E(G[B])|. By the minimality of G, G[A] and
G[B] admit feedback vertex sets SA and SB of size at most 2mA−nA+2
+ r(G[A]) and
2mB −nB +2

+ ǫ(G[B]), respectively. By Claim 4.3, ǫ(G[B]) = 0.

7
First assume that uA is not adjacent to vA. Let A′ = G[A] + uAvA. Note that A′ is
2-connected and has no disjoint cycles of length less than ﬁve. Since B is connected, A′
does not contain any induced subdivision of members of F. By the minimality of G, A′
admits a feedback vertex set SA′ of size at most 2(mA+1)−nA+2
+ ǫ(A′).
Then SA′ ∪ SB is a feedback vertex set of G of size at most

Therefore ǫ(A′) > 0, so A′ ∈ Fi,j for some i ≤ 4.

Since A′ − uAvA equals G[A] and has girth at least ﬁve, i ≥ 3 and (i, j) 6= (3, 1) by
Lemma 3.1. Furthermore, A′ 6∈ F3,2 ∪ F3,3, otherwise G[A] is an induced subgraph, and
hence an induced subdivision, of G isomorphic to a member of F. Hence, either i = 4 or
j = 0. If j = 0, then G[A] is a path, as desired. If i = 4, then ǫ(A′) ≤ 1

φ(G[A]) ≤ 2(mA+1)−nA+2

, as desired.

7 − 1 ≤ 2mA−nA−2

Therefore we may assume uA is adjacent to vA. If uA or vA has degree two in G, then
G[A] is isomorphic to K2, as desired. So we may assume uA and vA have degree three in
G. Let u′
A has degree two in G.
Let A′′ = G[A − {u′

Since A′′ has girth at least ﬁve and G is 2-connected, if r(A′′) > 0, then A′′ contains a block
with girth at least ﬁve belonging to Fi′,j′ for some i′, j′ with i′ ≤ 4 and j′ with i′ − j′ ≥ 2,
which implies that (i′, j′) = (4, 2) by Lemma 3.1, a contradiction. So r(A′′) = 0. Then
SA′′ ∪ SB ∪ {uA} is a feedback vertex set of G of size at most 2(m−2)−n−3+2

Therefore we may assume u′

A has degree three in G. Similarly, we may assume that v′
A
has degree three in G. Let x and y be the neighbors of u′
A distinct from uA. Note that
x and y are non-adjacent vertices distinct from vA since G[A] has girth at least ﬁve. Let
A′′′ = G[A\{u′
A, uA, vA}] + xy. By the minimality of G, A′′′ admits a feedback vertex set

2(mA − 4) − (nA − 3) + 2

+ r(A′′′).

Then SA′′′ ∪SB ∪{uA} is a feedback vertex set of G of size at most 2m−n+2
r(A′′′) > 0. So A′′′ contains a block D belonging to Fs,t for some s ≤ 4.

+r(A′′′). Hence,

If D does not contain xy, then D has girth at least ﬁve and contains at least two vertices
of degree at most two, so D ∈ F4,2 and D is an induced subgraph of G, a contradiction.
So D contains xy, and it is the unique block of A′′′ with ǫ > 0. Hence r(A′′′) = ǫ(D).

Note that D − xy has girth at least ﬁve, so s ≥ 3 and (s, t) 6= (3, 1). Note that D 6∈
F3,2 ∪ F3,3, otherwise G contains an induced subdivision of a member of F. Furthermore,
D 6∈ F3,0, otherwise G[V (D) ∪ {u′
A}] is a 4-cycle in G[A], a contradiction. So s = 4 and
r(A′′′) = 1
7 .

If D = A′′′, then φ(A′′′ − xy) ≤ 2(mA−4)−(nA−3)+2

since G is 2-connected and v′
A′′′ − D has no leaves, so φ(A′′′ − xy) = φ(D − xy) + φ(A′′′ − V (D)) = 2|E(D)|−|V (D)|+2

Claim 4.6. If [A, B] is a tight splitter of G, then G[A] is a path.

Proof. Let uA, vA be the ends of the edges between A, B in A, and let uB and vB be the
ends of the edges between A, B in B. Let nA = |A|, nB = |B|, mA = |E(G[A])| and
mB = |E(G[B])|.

Suppose that G[A] is not a path. By Claim 4.5, G[A] admits a feedback vertex sets SA
of size at most 2mA−nA−2
. Let H = G[B] − uB. Since [A, B] is tight, G[B] is 2-connected,
so H is connected and uB has degree two in G[B]. By the minimality of G, H admits a
feedback vertex set SH of size at most 2(mB −2)−(nB −1)+2

If D is a block of H with girth at least ﬁve and ǫ(D) > 0, then D contains at least two

F, a contradiction. Since G does not contain two disjoint cycles with length less than ﬁve,
there exists a unique block D with ǫ(D) > 0. Hence ǫ(D) = r(H) ≥ 3
7 and D ∈ Fi,j for
some i, j with 1 ≤ i ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ j ≤ i. Since D is simple, D ∈ F2,1. But every block of H

Claim 4.7. If u is a vertex of degree two in G, then G contains a cycle C with length ﬁve
and a cycle C ′ with length less than ﬁve such that u ∈ V (C) and V (C) ∩ V (C ′) = ∅.

Proof. Let G′ be the graph obtained from G by contracting an edge incident with u. By
Claim 4.3, the neighbors of u in G are non-adjacent. So G′ is simple, 2-connected and does
not contain an induced subdivision of a member of F. Suppose that G′ does not contain
two disjoint cycles of length less than ﬁve. By the minimality of G, G′ admits a feedback
vertex set S of size at most

Note that S is a feedback vertex set of G. Hence ǫ(G′) > 1
7 , so G′ ∈ Fi,j for some i, j with
i ≤ 3. This implies that G ∈ Fi+1,j, so r(G) ≥ 1
7 , a contradiction. Therefore, G′ contains
two disjoint cycles of length less than ﬁve, where one of them contains u. So G contains
two disjoint cycles, where one of them contains u and has length ﬁve, and the other has
length less than ﬁve.

We say that G is internally 3-edge-connected if G is 2-edge-connected and for every

edge-cut [A, B] of G of order two, |A| = 1 or |B| = 1.

Claim 4.8. G is internally 3-edge-connected.

Proof. Suppose that G is not internally 3-edge-connected. We deﬁne [A, B] to be an edge-
cut of G of order two such that |A| ≥ 2, |B| ≥ 2 and G[A] has girth at least ﬁve, and subject
to that, B is minimal. Note that such an edge-cut [A, B] exists since G is not internally
3-edge-connected, there exist an edge-cut of order two such that both sides contain at least
two vertices, and one side has girth at least ﬁve since G does not contain two disjoint cycles
of length less than ﬁve. Let uA, vA be the ends of the edges between A, B in A, and let uB
and vB be the ends of the edges between A, B in B. Notice that uA 6= vA since |A| ≥ 2,
but uB, vB are not necessarily distinct. Let nA = |A|, nB = |B|, mA = |E(G[A])| and
mB = |E(G[B])|.

We claim that G[B] is 2-connected. Suppose that G[B] is not 2-connected. If G[B]
contains a leaf v, then v ∈ {uB, vB} since G is 2-connected. Since G[A] has girth at least
ﬁve, |B| ≥ 3 by Claim 4.7. Then [A ∪ {v}, B − {v}] is an edge-cut of order two with

13

G[A ∪ {v}] girth at least ﬁve, contradicting the minimality of B. So G[B] has no leaf, and
hence G[B] contains at least two end-blocks, where each of them has minimum degree two.
Since G has no two disjoint cycles with length less than ﬁve, there exists an end-block B′
of G[B] such that B′ has girth at least ﬁve. Since G is 2-connected, B′ contains uB or vB.
Therefore [A∪V (B′), B−V (B′)] is an edge-cut of G of order two such that G[A∪V (B′)] has
girth at least ﬁve, contradicting the minimality of B. This proves that G[B] is 2-connected.
Therefore, [A, B] is a splitter and uB 6= vB. The minimality of B implies that [A, B] is

tight and uB and vB have degree three. By Claim 4.6, G[A] is a path.

Suppose that uB is adjacent to vB. Then G[A ∪ {uB, vB}] is a cycle. Since G is
not a cycle, [V (G − A − {uB, vB}), A ∪ {uB, vB} ∪ B] is an edge-cut of order two, where
G[A ∪ {uB, vB}] is a cycle, contradicting Claim 4.4.

So uB is not adjacent to vB. Therefore by Claim 4.7, G[A] is isomorphic to K2, uB and
vB share a neighbor in B which we call w, and there exists a cycle C in G[B] of length less
than ﬁve disjoint from {uB, vB, w}. By the minimality of B and Claim 4.7, w has degree
three in G.

+ r(H) = 2m−n−5

Let H = G[B] − uB. Then H admits a feedback vertex set SH of size at most
+ r(H). Then SH ∪ {uB} is a feedback vertex set of
G of size at most 2m−n+2
+ r(H). Hence, r(H) > 0. Since G[B] is 2-connected and uB
has degree two in G[B], each neighbor of uB is contained in an end-block of H and is not
a cut-vertex of H. So w is contained in an end-block of G[B], and no other block of H
contains w. But w has degree two in H, so both neighbors of w in H are contained in the
same block of H as w. Since vB is adjacent to w, w and vB are in the same end-block of
H. Let D be the end-block of H containing w and vB. Since [A, B] is a tight splitter, D
contains a cycle of length less than ﬁve, and hence C is contained in D.

If H is 2-connected, then ǫ(D) = r(H) > 0. If H is not 2-connected, then since there
are at most three edges in G between V (H) and V (G) − V (H), for every block D′ of H
other than D, [V (G) − V (D′), V (D′)] is an edge-cut of order two, so ǫ(D′) = 0 by Claim
4.3. Hence ǫ(D) = r(H) > 0 in either case. Therefore, D ∈ Fi,j for some i, j with 1 ≤ i ≤ 4
and 0 ≤ j ≤ i. Note that D contains three vertices of degree two in D, even if H is not
2-connected. So i − j ≥ 3, and hence i ≥ 3 and j ≤ 1. If j = 0, D is a triangle or 4-cycle,
so D = C. But C is disjoint from w, a contradiction. So i = 4 and j = 1. Therefore, D is
a subdivision of K4 with three vertices of degree two. We denote the vertex of degree two
in D other than w and vB by z.

Suppose that D is the unique non-trivial block of H. Since H has at most two end-
blocks, either H = D, or H is obtained from D by attaching a path P . If H = D, then let
H ′ = G; otherwise, let H ′ be the multigraph obtained from G by suppressing all vertices
in P . Note that in the latter case, H ′ is the multigraph G[A ∪ V (D) ∪ {uB}] + uBz. So
H ′ is the same graph in either case. But H ′ can be obtained from a subdivision of K4
by applying operation ◦ and then subdividing edges, so H ′ ∈ Fi′,j′ for some nonnegative
integers i′, j′ with j′ ≤ i′. However, G is a subdivision of H ′, so G ∈ Fi′′,j′′ for some

14

nonnegative integers i′′, j′′, a contradiction. Therefore, H contains a non-trivial block W
other than D.

However, [V (W ), V (G) − V (W )] is an edge-cut of G of order two such that both sides
contain at least two vertices and W has girth at least ﬁve. So there exists an edge-cut
[A′′, B′′] of G of order two such that both sides contains at least two vertices, V (W ) ⊆ A′′,
G[A′′] has girth at least ﬁve, and subject to those, B′′ is minimal. Then [A′′, B′′] is a
tight splitter. Claim 4.6 implies that G[A′′] is a path. But W is a subgraph of G[A′′], a
contradiction. This completes the proof.

The following two claims were proved in [6].

Claim 4.9 ([6]). If u, v are vertices of G of degree three, then there exist three internally
disjoint paths from u to v.

Claim 4.10 ([6]). If X ⊆ V (G) and |E(X, V (G − X))| = 3, then G − X is connected and
has at most one nontrivial block. Furthermore, if u, v ∈ V (G − X) are adjacent to vertices
in X but uv 6∈ E(G), then (G − X) + uv has at most one nontrivial block.

Claim 4.11. G is triangle-free.

Proof. Suppose a, b, and c are the vertices of a triangle in G. Since G is not a triangle, all
have degree three by Claim 4.8. Let X = {a, b, c}. Let a′, b′, and c′ be the neighbors of
a, b, and c not in X respectively. If a′, b′, and c′ are not pairwise distinct, then by Claim
4.8, G ∈ {K4, K +
4 } ⊆ F1,1 ∪ F2,1, a contradiction. Therefore a′, b′, and c′ are pairwise
distinct. If a′, b′, and c′ are pairwise adjacent, then G contains two disjoint triangles, a
contradiction. Suppose one of a′, b′, c′ is adjacent to the other two. We may assume without
loss of generality that a′ is adjacent to b′ and c′. By Claim 4.8, either V (G) = X ∪{a′, b′, c′}
or G − (X ∪ {a′, b′, c′}) is an isolated vertex. In the ﬁrst case, G ∈ F3,1, a contradiction.
In the second case, G contains a triangle disjoint from a 4-cycle, a contradiction.

Therefore, |E(G[{a′, b′, c′}])| ≤ 1. By symmetry, we may assume that b′ is not adjacent
to a′ or c′. Let H = (G − X) + b′c′. By Claim 4.10, H is connected and has at most
one nontrivial block, denoted by B, so r(H) = ǫ(B). Since G − X has girth at least ﬁve,
H contains no disjoint cycles of length less than ﬁve. Note that H does not contain an
induced subdivision of a member of F, so H admits a feedback vertex set S of size at most

Then S ∪ {a} is a feedback vertex set of G of size at most 2m−n+2

7

+ ǫ(B) vertices, so

If (G−X)+b′c′ is 2-connected, then G = H ◦(b′c′, b′c′, a′), so G ∈ Fi,j+1, a contradiction.
So (G − X) + b′c′ is not 2-connected. Hence, a′ is a leaf of (GX ) + b′c′. Since a′, b′, c′ are
the only vertices adjacent to some vertex in X and b′c′ ∈ E(H), B = H − a′. Let a′′ be the
neighbor of a′ other than a. Then G can be obtained from B ◦ (b′c′, b′c′, a′′) by subdividing
an edge. Hence G ∈ Fi+1,j+1, a contradiction.

15

Claim 4.12. No vertex in a cycle of G of length less than ﬁve has degree two in G.

Proof. Let D be a cycle of length less than ﬁve containing a vertex v of degree two in G.
By Claim 4.11, D is a 4-cycle. By Claim 4.7, there exists a cycle C of length ﬁve containing
v and a cycle C ′ with length less than ﬁve disjoint from C. Since v has degree two, D
shares at least three vertices with C. Since G is subcubic, C ′ and D are disjoint cycles of
length less than ﬁve, a contradiction.

Claim 4.13. Let a, b, and c be distinct vertices of degree three in G such that abc is a path
in G. Let a1 and a2 be the neighbors of a other than b, let c1 and c2 be the neighbors of
c other than b, and let b′ be the other neighbor of b. If G′ = (G − {a, b, c}) + a1a2 + c1c2,
then G′ contains two disjoint cycles of length less than ﬁve.

Proof. Note that a1a2, c1c2 6∈ E(G) and {a1, a2, c1, c2} ∩ {a, b, c} = ∅ since G is triangle-
free. Then G = G′ ◦ (a1a2, c1c2, b), so G′ is connected and G′ /∈ Fi,j for every integers i, j.
Note that G′ does not contain an induced subdivision of a member of F as G does not.
By Claim 4.10, G − b has at most one nontrivial block. Since G is triangle-free, G′ has
at most one nontrivial block, denoted by B. Since G has minimum degree at least two,
b′ is the only possible vertex in G′ that has degree less than two. Since G is internally
3-edge-connected, G has no two adjacent vertices of degree at most two. So either G′ = B
or G′ is obtained from B by attaching the leaf b′.

so r(G′) > 0. If G′ = B, then B ∈ Fs,t for some integers s, t with s ≥ 1 and 0 ≤ t ≤ s, a
contradiction. So G′ is obtained from B by attaching the leaf b′. Let b′′ be the neighbor
of b′ in B. But then G is obtained from B ◦ (a1a2, c1c2, b′′) by subdividing an edge, so
G ∈ Fs+1,t+1, a contradiction.

Claim 4.14. G has girth at least ﬁve.

Proof. Suppose to the contrary that G contains a cycle C of length less than ﬁve. Since G
is triangle-free, C is a 4-cycle. Let C = abcda. By claim 4.12, a, b, c and d have neighbors
a′, b′, c′, and d′ not in C, respectively. Since G is triangle-free, {a′, c′} is disjoint from
{b′, d′}.

Suppose that a′ = c′ and b′ = d′. If a′ is adjacent to b′, then G = K3,3 and φ(G) = 2 =
2m−n+2
, a contradiction. So a′ is not adjacent to b′. Since G is internally 3-edge-connected,
there exists a vertex v of degree two in G adjacent to a′ and b′, so G can be obtained from
K3,3 by subdividing an edge. Hence φ(G) = 2 < 2m−n+2

, a contradiction.

Therefore we may assume without loss of generality that a′ 6= c′. Since G is triangle-
free, d is not adjacent to a′ or c′. Let G′ = (G − {a, b, c}) + {a′d, c′d}. By Claim 4.13,
G′ contains two disjoint cycles D1, D2 of length less than ﬁve. Since G does not contain
two such cycles, one of them, say D1, contains at least one edge in {a′d, c′d}. Therefore

d ∈ V (D1). Since D2 is in G′ and is disjoint from D1, D2 does not contain any of {a, b, c, d}.
Therefore C and D2 are two disjoint cycle of length less than ﬁve in G, a contradiction.

Note that Claims 4.7 and 4.14 imply that G is cubic.

Claim 4.15. Let v ∈ V (G), and let a, b, and c be the neighbors of v. Let a1 and a2 be the
neighbors of a other than v, and let b1 and b2 be the neighbors of b other than v. Then G−v
contains two disjoint 5-cycles, where one contains the path a1aa2 and the other contains
the path b1bb2.

Proof. Let G′ = (G − {a, v, b}) + a1a2 + b1b2. By Claim 4.13, there are two disjoint cycles
in G of length less than ﬁve, where one of them contains a1a2 and the other contains b1b2,
since G has girth at least ﬁve. So G contains two disjoint cycles of length at most ﬁve,
where one contains a1aa2 and the other contains b1bb2. These two cycles have length ﬁve
since G has girth at least ﬁve.

By [6, Theorem 6.1], G is the dodecahedron, which is in F5,5, a contradiction. This

completes the proof of Theorem 1.5.
