Abstract

A new, so called odd Gel’fand-Zetlin basis is introduced for the irreducible covariant tensor
representations of the Lie superalgebra gl(n|n). The related Gel’fand-Zetlin patterns are based
upon the decomposition according to a particular chain of subalgebras of gl(n|n). This chain
contains only genuine Lie superalgebras of type gl(k|l) with k and l nonzero (apart from the
ﬁnal element of the chain which is gl(1|0) ≡ gl(1)). Explicit expressions for a set of generators
of the algebra on this Gel’fand-Zetlin basis are determined. The results are extended to an
explicit construction of a class of irreducible highest weight modules of the general linear Lie
superalgebra gl(∞|∞).

Introduction

Many decades ago, Green [1] generalized standard quantum statistics describing bosons and fer-
mions, and introduced parabosons and parafermions. Typically, the relations for paraboson and
parafermion creation and annihilation operators are triple relations rather than just commutators
or anticommutators. Greenberg and Messiah [2] studied mixed system consisting of parafermions
j and parabosons b±
f ±
j , and their relative commutation relations. As far as the underlying algebraic
structure is concerned, Palev [3] proved that k parafermions f ±
j with so-called
relative parafermion relations generate the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp(2k + 1|2n). The
explicit construction of the corresponding parastatistics Fock space, which is an inﬁnite-dimensional
unitary representation of osp(2k + 1|2n), turned out to be a very diﬃcult problem, and was com-
pleted only recently [4]. In this construction, the branching osp(2k + 1|2n) ⊃ gl(k|n) plays a crucial
role, and allows to label the states of the parastatistics Fock space by means of Gel’fand-Zetlin
(GZ) labels of covariant representations of the subalgebra gl(k|n).

j and n parabosons b±

The real interest lies in such quantum systems with inﬁnite degrees of freedom, consisting of
a mixed system of an inﬁnite number of parafermions and parabosons (k → ∞ and n → ∞). In
such a case, the parastatistics Fock space could be seen as a unitary representation of some inﬁnite
rank Lie superalgebra osp(∞|∞). In order to study this representation along the lines of [4–6], it

is clear that the subalgebra gl(∞|∞) and its covariant representations will play a crucial role. Of
course, one has to be more precise in what is meant by the inﬁnite rank Lie superalgebra gl(∞|∞),
and by its class of covariant representations.

For an inﬁnite number of parabosons (or an inﬁnite number of parafermions, but not mixed),
the problem was already investigated in [7]. Roughly speaking, for that case the GZ-basis for
gl(n) covariant representations could be naturally extended to “a stable GZ-pattern” for gl(∞),
and that oﬀered a way of describing the paraboson (resp. parafermion) Fock space with an inﬁnite
degree of freedom. Turning our attention to a mixed system, one might expect that the known
GZ-basis [8] for covariant representations of gl(k|n) can also quite naturally be extended to some
inﬁnite but stable GZ-patterns for gl(∞|∞). However, there is a problem with this. Indeed, the
natural GZ-basis for gl(k|n) [8] is based on the decomposition according to the branching

gl(k|n) ⊃ gl(k|n − 1) ⊃ gl(k|n − 2) ⊃ · · · ⊃ gl(k|1) ⊃ gl(k) ⊃ gl(k − 1) ⊃ · · · ⊃ gl(2) ⊃ gl(1). (1.1)

The corresponding GZ-basis pattern [8, eq. (3.12)] consists of a triangular array of (k + n) rows
(and columns), in such a way that the triangle consisting of the k bottom rows corresponds to a
common gl(k) GZ-pattern, the triangle corresponding to the n rightmost columns corresponds to a
gl(n) GZ-pattern, and the remaining (k × n) rectangle contains the remaining basis labels satisfying
certain “θ-conditions”. Clearly, such a basis can not be used in the limit when both k and n tend to
inﬁnity. For example, when k goes to inﬁnity, the bottom triangle (with, evidently, some stability
conditions) stretches to inﬁnity and one can never get control over the labels related to the gl(n)
part of gl(k|n). Similarly, when n goes to inﬁnity, the upper right triangle stretches to inﬁnity at
the left, and one cannot get hold of the labels related to the gl(k) part of gl(k|n). This problem,
described schematically only, is related to the particular choice of subalgebras in the chain (1.1).

In this paper, we show that another chain of subalgebras,

gl(n|n) ⊃ gl(n|n−1) ⊃ gl(n−1|n−1) ⊃ gl(n−1|n−2) ⊃ gl(n−2|n−2) ⊃ · · · ⊃ gl(1|1) ⊃ gl(1) (1.2)

is appropriate for considering the limit when n goes to inﬁnity, and allows us to construct stable
GZ-patterns for covariant representations of gl(∞|∞). This is also related to the fact that the last
chain can be “reversed”,

gl(1) = gl(1|0) ⊂ gl(1|1) ⊂ gl(2|1) ⊂ gl(2|2) ⊂ gl(3|2) ⊂ gl(3|3) ⊂ · · · ⊂ gl(∞|∞).

(1.3)

The main part of the paper is thus devoted to constructing a new GZ-basis for covariant
representations of gl(n|n) according to the chain of subalgebras (1.2). Of course, the notion of
“GZ-basis” does not just refer to a way of labeling the basis vectors of the representation, but also
to the fact that the action of a set of generators of the algebra on these basis vectors can be given.
In the current situation, it turns out that the set of generators for which the action on the new
GZ-basis vectors takes the simplest form, is a set of non-distinguished simple root vectors of gl(n|n)
consisting of odd roots only. For this reason, the new GZ-basis will be called “the odd GZ-basis”.
Our main result is Theorem 4, giving the explicit action of the generators on the odd GZ-basis
vectors.

The new GZ-basis for gl(n|n) is interesting on its own: it is simple, elegant, and for the ﬁrst
time one is dealing with a basis on which the action of a set of odd generators is simple and
natural. The main importance is that the basis and generator action can be extended to a class of
representations of gl(∞|∞).

There are a number of ways to deﬁne the inﬁnite dimensional and inﬁnite rank Lie superalgebra
gl(∞|∞). We follow the common deﬁnition [9] in terms of certain squared inﬁnite matrices with

2

a ﬁnite number of nonzero entries, on which a grading is ﬁxed. The GZ-patterns for gl(n|n) can
be extended to inﬁnite GZ-patterns for gl(∞|∞) in a rather straight way. Those inﬁnite GZ-
patterns should however satisfy a certain stability condition, in order to correspond to a basis for
an irreducible representation of gl(∞|∞).

In Section 2 we deﬁne the Lie superalgebra gl(k|n) and remind the reader of covariant tensor
representations of gl(k|n). In Section 3, we construct the covariant tensor representations of gl(n|n)
introducing the odd Gel’fand-Zetlin basis following the decomposition (1.2). We give the action
of the gl(n|n) generators on the basis and prove that the algebra relations are satisﬁed in these
representations. The inﬁnite-dimensional general linear Lie superalgebra gl(∞|∞) is deﬁned in
Section 4. Inﬁnite odd GZ-patterns with a so-called stability index are introduced in Section 5.
We prove that the Lie superalgebra gl(∞|∞) has an irreducible action on basis vectors labelled by
these stable odd GZ-patterns.

2 The Lie superalgebra gl(k|n) and covariant representations

The underlying vector space for the Lie superalgebra g = gl(k|n) consists of the space of (r × r)-
matrices, with

r = k + n.

(2.1)

The Lie superalgebra g = gl(k|n) can be deﬁned [10, 11] through its natural matrix realization

gl(k|n) = {x =(cid:18) A B

C D (cid:19) |A ∈ Mk×k, B ∈ Mk×n, C ∈ Mn×k, D ∈ Mn×n},

(2.2)

where Mp×q is the space of all p × q complex matrices. The even subalgebra gl(k|n)¯0 has B = 0 and
C = 0; the odd subspace gl(k|n)¯1 has A = 0 and D = 0. Note that gl(k|n)¯0 = gl(k) ⊕ gl(n). The
Lie superalgebra is then deﬁned by means of the bracket Jx, yK = xy − (−1)deg(x) deg(y)yx, where x
and y are homogeneous elements.

It will be convenient to use the ordered set {−k, . . . , −2, −1; 1, 2, . . . n} as indices for the rows
and columns of the matrices in (2.2) throughout this paper. So in (2.2), the elements of A have
negative indices only, those of D have positive indices only, etc. Furthermore, it will sometimes be
convenient to write the minus sign of an index as an overlined number. So with this convention
the indices . . . , ¯3, ¯2, ¯1; 1, 2, 3, . . . stand for . . . , −3, −2, −1; 1, 2, 3 . . ..

A basis for g = gl(k|n) consists of matrices Eij (i, j = −k, . . . , −2, −1; 1, 2, . . . , n), with entry 1
at position (i, j) and 0 elsewhere. This is usually called the Weyl basis. The bracket for these basis
elements is given by

JEab, EcdK = δbcEad − (−1)deg(Eab) deg(Ecd)δadEcb.

(2.3)

A Cartan subalgebra h of g is spanned by the elements Ejj (j = −k, . . . , −2, −1; 1, 2, . . . , n). The
space dual to h is h∗ and is described by the forms ǫi (i = −k, . . . , −2, −1; 1, 2, . . . , n) where
ǫi : x → Aii (i = −k, −k + 1, . . . , −1) and ǫi : x → Dii (i = 1, 2, . . . , n), and where x is given as in
(2.2). The components of an element Λ ∈ h∗ will be written as

[m]r = [m−k,r, . . . , m−2,r, m−1,r; m1r, m2r, . . . , mnr]

= [m¯k,r, . . . , m¯2,r, m¯1,r; m1r, m2r, . . . , mnr],

where

mirǫi,

Λ =

n

Xi=−k

i6=0

(2.4)

(2.5)

and mir are complex numbers. The elements of h∗ are called the weights. The roots of gl(k|n) take
the form ǫi − ǫj (i 6= j) and the positive roots are ǫi − ǫj (i < j). By the index convention, ǫi − ǫj
is an even root when i · j > 0 and an odd root when i · j < 0. So the positive odd roots are of the
form ǫi − ǫj with i < 0 and j > 0. The distinguished set of simple roots is usually taken to be

ǫ−k − ǫ−k+1, ǫ−k+1 − ǫ−k+2, . . . , ǫ−1 − ǫ1, ǫ1 − ǫ2, . . . , ǫn−1 − ǫn,

(2.6)

and this set contains only one odd simple root. An element Λ ∈ h∗ with components [m]r will
be called an integral dominant weight if mir − mi+1,r ∈ Z+ = {0, 1, 2, . . .} for all i 6= −1, 0
(−k ≤ i ≤ n − 1).

For every integral dominant weight Λ ≡ [m]r there exists a unique ﬁnite-dimensional irreducible
gl(k|n) module V ([Λ]) with highest weight Λ. The class of representations considered here is more
restrictive. We will concentrate on the covariant tensor representations (simply referred to as
covariant representations), which are known to be ﬁnite-dimensional, irreducible and unitary. Berele
and Regev [12] showed that the tensor product V ([1, 0, . . . , 0])⊗N of N copies of the natural (k + n)-
dimensional representation V ([1, 0, . . . , 0]) of gl(k|n) is completely reducible, and the irreducible
components, Vλ, can be labeled by a partition λ of N of length l(λ) and weight |λ|, where λ =
(λ1, λ2, . . . , λℓ), with l(λ) = ℓ, |λ| = λ1 + λ2 + . . . + λℓ = N , and λi ≥ λi+1 > 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , ℓ − 1,
satisfying the condition λk+1 ≤ n. For deﬁnitions regarding partitions, see [13]. The condition
λk+1 ≤ n is known as the hook condition: in terms of Young diagrams, it means that the diagram
of λ should be inside the (k, n)-hook [12].

Covariant representations are also highest weight representations, so to every such partition λ
there should correspond an integral dominant weight Λλ such that Vλ is isomorphic to the highest
weight module V ([Λλ]). The relation between Λλ ≡ [m]r (see (2.4)) and λ = (λ1, λ2, . . .) is such
that [14]:

mir = λk+i+1, −k ≤ i ≤ −1,
mir = max{0, λ′

i − k},

1 ≤ i ≤ n,

(2.7)

(2.8)

where λ′ is the partition conjugate [13] to λ. Conversely if Λ ≡ [m]r is integral dominant with all
mir ∈ Z+ and

m−1,r ≥ #{i : mir > 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ n},

(2.9)

then there exists a partition λ such that V ([Λ]) is isomorphic to the irreducible covariant tensor
module Vλ, and the components of λ are given explicitly by

λi = mi−k−1,r,
λk+i = #{j : mjr ≤ i, 1 ≤ j ≤ n},

1 ≤ i ≤ k,

1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Note that (2.9) can also be written in an alternative form:

if m−1,r = p then mir = 0 for all i > p.

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

The main property of irreducible covariant tensor modules of gl(k|n) is that their characters
are known explicitly [12, 15]: they are given by supersymmetric Schur functions. Explicitly, with
the common notation

xi = eǫi

(−k ≤ i ≤ −1),

yi = eǫi

(1 ≤ i ≤ n),

one has

char V ([Λλ]) = sλ(x¯k, . . . , x¯2, x¯1|y1, y2, . . . , yn),

(2.13)

4

with sλ a supersymmetric Schur function [12, 13, 15, 16].

In this paper, the decomposition of covariant representations of gl(k|n) according to gl(k|n) ⊃
gl(k − 1|n) or to gl(k|n) ⊃ gl(k|n − 1) will be crucial for the construction of a proper Gel’fand-Zetlin
basis. Such decompositions, which are multiplicity-free, follow from properties of supersymmetric
Schur functions [8, 16]. In particular,

sλ(x¯k, xk−1, . . . , x¯2, x¯1|y1, y2, . . . , yn) =Xσ

x|λ|−|σ|
¯k

sσ(xk−1, . . . , x¯2, x¯1|y1, y2, . . . , yn),

(2.14)

where the sum is over all partitions σ in the (k − 1, n)-hook such that

λ1 ≥ σ1 ≥ λ2 ≥ σ2 ≥ · · · ≥ σl−1 ≥ λl,

(2.15)

where l stands for the length of λ. In terms of the notions introduced in [13], (2.15) means that
λ − σ is a horizontal strip. Similarly,

sλ(x¯k, . . . , x¯2, x¯1|y1, . . . , yn−1, yn) =Xσ

sσ(x¯k, . . . , x¯2, x¯1|y1, . . . , yn−1) · y|λ|−|σ|

(2.16)

where the sum is now over all partitions σ in the (k, n − 1)-hook such that

1 ≥ σ′

1 ≥ λ′

2 ≥ σ′

2 ≥ · · · ≥ σ′

ℓ−1 ≥ λ′

ℓ ,

(2.17)

where ℓ = λ1 stands for the length of λ′. Following the terminology of [13], λ − σ is a vertical strip.

3 The odd GZ-basis for covariant representations of gl(n|n)

The purpose of this section is to construct a new GZ-basis for covariant representations of gl(n|n).
In this construction, the labelling arising from the decomposition of the representation according
to the subalgebra chain

gl(n|n) ⊃ gl(n|n − 1) ⊃ gl(n − 1|n − 1)

will be used. For the decomposition itself, it is clear that the Schur function identities of the previous
section give all necessary information. The second part of this section is devoted to computing the
action of a set of gl(n|n) generators on the GZ-basis vectors.

Let V ([m]r), r = 2n be an irreducible covariant tensor module of gl(n|n) determined by its

highest weight, given by the nonnegative integer r-tuple

[m]r = [m−n,r, . . . , m−2,r, m−1,r; m1r, m2r, . . . , mnr],

mir − mi+1,r ∈ Z+,

i = −n, . . . , −2; 1, . . . , n − 1

such that

and

Within a given gl(n|n) module V ([m]r) the numbers (3.1) are ﬁxed.

m−1,r ≥ #{i : mir > 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

Proposition 1 Consider the gl(n|n) module V ([m]r) as a gl(n|n − 1) module. Then V ([m]r) can
be represented as a direct sum of covariant simple gl(n|n − 1) modules,

V ([m]r) =Xi

⊕Vi([m]r−1),

(3.4)

where

5

I. All Vi([m]r−1) carry inequivalent representations of gl(n|n − 1)

[m]r−1 = [m−n,r−1, . . . , m−1,r−1; m1,r−1, . . . , mn−1,r−1],
mi,r−1 − mi+1,r−1 ∈ Z+, i = −n, . . . , −2, 1, . . . , n − 2,
m−1,r−1 ≥ #{i : mi,r−1 > 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}.

II.

1. mir − mi,r−1 = θi,r−1 ∈ {0, 1}, −n ≤ i ≤ −1,
2. mir − mi,r−1 ∈ Z+ and mi,r−1 − mi+1,r ∈ Z+,

1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.

(3.5)

Proof. The above conditions follow from (2.16), with λ the partition corresponding to the gl(n|n)
highest weight [m]r. The conditions I come from the fact that the partition σ in (2.16) determines
a covariant representation of gl(n|n − 1), with highest weight denoted by [m]r−1. The conditions II
follow from (2.17), or from the fact that λ−σ is a vertical strip. When these “interlacing” conditions
for λ and σ are rewritten in terms of the corresponding highest weights [m]r and [m]r−1, (3.5) arises.
✷

Proposition 2 Consider a covariant gl(n|n − 1) module V ([m]r−1) as a gl(n − 1|n − 1) module.
Then V ([m]r−1) can be represented as a direct sum of simple gl(n − 1|n − 1) modules V ([m]r−2),

V ([m]r−1) =Xi

⊕Vi([m]r−2),

(3.6)

where

I. All Vi([m]r−2) carry inequivalent representations of gl(n − 1|n − 1)

[m]r−2 = [m−n+1,r−2, . . . , m−1,r−2; m1,r−2, . . . , mn−1,r−2],
mi,r−2 − mi+1,r−2 ∈ Z+, i = −n + 1, . . . , −2, 1, . . . , n − 2,
m−1,r−2 ≥ #{i : mi,r−2 > 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}.

II.

1. mi,r−2 − mi,r−1 = θi,r−2 ∈ {0, 1},
2. mi,r−1 − mi+1,r−2 ∈ Z+ and mi+1,r−2 − mi+1,r−1 ∈ Z+, −n ≤ i ≤ −2.

1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,

(3.7)

Proof. The proof is the same as for the previous proposition, but now we use (2.14). The
“interlacing” conditions (2.15) for λ and σ, rewritten in terms of the corresponding highest weights
[m]r−1 and [m]r−2, give rise to (3.7).
✷

Since in each step of the reduction

gl(n|n) ⊃ gl(n|n−1) ⊃ gl(n−1|n−1) ⊃ gl(n−1|n−2) ⊃ gl(n−2|n−2) ⊃ · · · ⊃ gl(1|1) ⊃ gl(1) (3.8)

the decomposition of V ([m]r) is multiplicity-free and follows simple rules, this gives rise to an
interesting GZ-basis for the basis vectors of V ([m]r). Hence Propositions 1 and 2, and the fact that
representations of gl(1) are one-dimensional, imply:

constitute a basis in V ([m]r).

Conditions 2 and 3 are referred to as “θ-conditions”. Conditions 6 and 7 are often referred to
as “in-betweenness conditions.” Note that the arrows in this pattern have no real function, and
can be omitted. We ﬁnd it useful to include them, just in order to visualize the conditions. When
there is an arrow a → b between labels a and b, it means that either b = a or else b = a + 1 (a
θ-condition). We will also refer to “rows” and “columns” of the GZ-pattern. Rows are counted from
the bottom: row 1 is the bottom row in (3.9), and row r is the top row in (3.9). In an obvious way,
columns 1, 2, 3 · · · refer to the columns to the right of the dashed line in (3.9), and columns −1,
−2, −3, · · · (or ¯1, ¯2, ¯3, · · · ) to the columns to the left of this dashed line. For two consecutive rows
in the GZ-pattern (3.9), about half of the labels involve θ-conditions, and the other half involves
in-betweenness conditions. Note that a row in the GZ-pattern always corresponds to the highest
weight labels of some subalgebra gl(k|l) in the chain (3.8). The dashed line in (3.9) also has no
function, but is there just to distinguish between the labels on the left (corresponding to gl(k)) and
those to the right (corresponding to gl(l)).

We shall refer to the basis (3.9) as the odd GZ-basis for the covariant gl(n|n) representations.
The task is now to give the explicit action of a set of gl(n|n) generators on the basis vectors (3.9).

When describing actions of a Lie algebra or Lie superalgebra on some GZ-basis vector, this is
usually not done for all algebra basis elements but only for a set of generators. The actions of the
remaining algebra elements then follows by applying the Lie (super)algebra brackets. For the case
of gl(n|n), if one works in the traditional GZ-basis [8], one is describing the action of the following
generators:

• the basis elements Eii (i = −n, . . . , −1; 1, . . . , n) of the Cartan subalgebra,

• the Chevalley generators E−1,1, Ei,i+1 (i = −n, . . . , −2; 1, . . . , n − 1), corresponding to the

set of simple roots (2.6),

• the Chevalley generators E1,−1, Ei+1,i (i = −n, . . . , −2; 1, . . . , n − 1), corresponding to the

negatives of the simple roots.

These form indeed a set of generating elements. The reason for this choice of generators is the
following: amongst all basis elements Eij with i 6= j, the above Chevalley generators have the
“simplest” action on a traditional GZ-basis element [8]. This simplicity is evident from the fact
that by the action of the generators the GZ-labels change only in one row of the GZ-pattern.

Currently, we are dealing with a diﬀerent GZ-basis, the odd GZ-basis for gl(n|n). So it is not
surprising that the choice of generators, in order to describe the action on the GZ-basis elements,
is diﬀerent. Of course, the “diagonal action” by means of the Cartan subalgebra basis elements
will still remain. For the other generators, it is natural to make the following choice:

• the positive root vectors

E−1,1, E−2,1, E−2,2, E−3,2, E−3,3, . . . , E−n,n−1, E−n,n,

(3.11)

• the negative root vectors

E1,−1, E1,−2, E2,−2, E2,−3, E3,−3, . . . , En−1,−n, En,−n.

(3.12)

Note that these would correspond to the root vectors E±α for the following choice of simple roots:

ǫ−1 − ǫ1, ǫ1 − ǫ−2, ǫ−2 − ǫ2, ǫ2 − ǫ−3, . . . , ǫ−n+1 − ǫn−1, ǫn−1 − ǫ−n, ǫ−n − ǫn.

(3.13)

This set of simple roots contains odd roots only, which is the reason to refer to our new GZ-basis
as “the odd GZ-basis”. From the relation with this set of simple roots (3.13), it also follows that
the elements (3.11)-(3.12) (together with the Eii) form indeed a set of generators.

The following theorem is one of the two main results of this paper. It describes the action of the
new set of generators on the odd GZ-basis vectors. In this theorem we use some further notation
(ϕ = 0, 1; k = 1, . . . , n):

li,2k−ϕ = mi,2k−ϕ − i

(−k ≤ i ≤ −1);

lp,2k−ϕ = −mp,2k−ϕ + p (1 ≤ p ≤ k − ϕ).

(3.14)

Furthermore, |m)r

±(ij) is the pattern obtained from |m)r by replacing the entry mij by mij ± 1.

Theorem 4 The transformation of the irreducible covariant tensor module V ([m]r) under the ac-
tion of the gl(n|n) generators is given by:

All vectors |m)r of the module V ([m]r) are weight vectors, so the action of the elements Eii on
|m)r is diagonal. In fact, (3.15) and (3.16) just yield the weight of the corresponding vector. The
action of the other generators on |m)r is “simple”, in the sense that the action changes only one
label of the GZ-pattern by +1 or −1, and all changes appear in one row of the pattern only.

We shall only give an outline of the proof of Theorem 4, since it is very technical. The main
part of the proof consist of showing that the composition of the actions (3.17)-(3.20) by means of
(anti)commutators yield the correct action. So one has to show that

(E−i,iEi,−i + Ei,−iE−i,i)|m)r = (E−i,−i + Eii)|m)r, 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
(E−i−1,iEi,−i−1 + Ei,−i−1E−i−1,i)|m)r = (E−i−1,−i−1 + Eii)|m)r, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.

(3.21)

(3.22)

In such computations, the left hand side becomes extremely complicated, whereas the right hand
side is simple. The simpliﬁcation of the left hand side involves several steps, and it is instructive
to explain these steps by means of a generic example. It should be clear that the arguments used
in the example hold in general.

So let us take for a moment n = 4, i = 2, and consider the action of the left hand side of (3.22)

on a general vector with GZ-labels (r = 8)

In particular, because of the θ-conditions, one can write this vector as

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(3.24)
where essentially each θ can be 0 or 1. Compute now the action (E¯32E2¯3 + E2¯3E¯32)|m)8 on the
vector (3.24), using (3.18) and (3.20), and collect the terms with the same GZ-pattern. It is fairly
easy (but technical) to verify that all non-diagonal terms (i.e. the terms with a GZ-pattern that
is diﬀerent from |m)8) cancel automatically because of the sign-factors S(·). The coeﬃcient of the
diagonal term (i.e. the term in |m)8 itself) yields, using the expressions (3.18) and (3.20):

(m¯35 − m¯13 + 1)(m¯25 − m¯13)(m¯13 − m¯15 + 1)(m¯13 + m13)

(m¯13 + m15 + 1)(m¯13 + m25)(m¯23 − m¯13 + 1)

+

+

+

(m¯35 + m15 + 2)(m¯25 + m15 + 1)(m¯15 + m15)(m15 − m13 + 1)

(m¯23 + m15 + 2)(m¯13 + m15 + 1)(m15 − m25 + 1)

(m¯35 + m25 + 1)(m¯25 + m25)(m¯15 + m25 − 1)(m13 − m25)

(m¯23 + m25 + 1)(m¯13 + m25)(m15 − m25 + 1)

(m¯35 − m¯23)(m¯23 − m¯25 + 1)(m¯23 − m¯15 + 2)(m¯23 + m13 + 1)

(m¯23 + m15 + 2)(m¯23 + m25 + 1)(m¯23 − m¯13 + 1)

.

(3.25)

Observe that this coeﬃcient is independent of the θ-values, so that reduces the number of cases to
be considered. In order to understand the structure of such coeﬃcients, let us make the following
substitutions in this last expression:

m¯23 = −x0, m¯13 = −x1 + 1, m15 = x2 − 2, m25 = x3 − 1,
m¯35 = −a0, m¯25 = −a1 + 1, m¯15 = −a2 + 2, m13 = a3 − 1.

This yields:

(x1 − a0)(x1 − a1)(x1 − a2)(x1 − a3)

(x1 − x0)(x1 − x2)(x1 − x3)

(x3 − a0)(x3 − a1)(x3 − a2)(x3 − a3)

(x3 − x0)(x3 − x1)(x3 − x2)

+

+

(x2 − a0)(x2 − a1)(x2 − a2)(x2 − a3)

(x2 − x0)(x2 − x1)(x2 − x3)

(x0 − a0)(x0 − a1)(x0 − a2)(x0 − a3)

(x0 − x1)(x0 − x2)(x0 − x3)

.

(3.26)

This expression simpliﬁes (see soon), and yields

x0 + x1 + x2 + x3 − a0 − a1 − a2 − a3 = m¯35 + m¯25 + m¯15 + m15 + m25 − m¯23 − m¯13 − m13.

With (3.15)-(3.16), one also ﬁnds

(E¯3¯3 + E22)|m)8 = (m¯35 + m¯25 + m¯15 + m15 + m25 − m¯23 − m¯13 − m13)|m)8.

So we have shown, for this example, that the anticommutator relation {E¯32, E2¯3} = E¯3¯3 + E22
holds when acting on an arbitrary vector of the form (3.23).

For the general veriﬁcation of relations (3.21)-(3.22), the arguments are the same. The non-
diagonal terms arising in the left hand side cancel, and the coeﬃcient of the diagonal term is of the

11

form (3.25). After making appropriate substitutions, the coeﬃcient always reduces to an expression
of the form (3.26). For the simpliﬁcation of such expressions, one can make use of the following
rational function identity:

(xi − xj)

(3.27)

The proof of such identities is standard [17], and uses the Lagrange interpolation formula. For
completeness, we present a short proof in the Appendix.

So far, we have described the proof of (3.21)-(3.22), and this does not yet prove Theorem 4
completely. To continue, one should consider the remaining basis elements of gl(n|n) and their
action on |m)r. The action of other basis elements is determined by consecutive actions of the
generators, e.g.

E−n,−n+1|m)r = (E−n,n−1En−1,−n+1 + En−1,−n+1E−n,n−1)|m)r,
E−n+1,−n+2|m)r = (E−n+1,n−2En−2,−n+2 + En−2,−n+2E−n+1,n−2)|m)r, etc.

Once this has been achieved, it remains to verify that the deﬁning relations (2.3) hold when acting on
an arbitrary vector |m)r. This, however, is easier than it sounds: the validity of the corresponding
equation follows from consecutive use of the Jacobi-identity, from the deﬁnition in terms of the
generators themselves, from the equations (3.21)-(3.22), or from simple cancellations due to the
sign factors S(·) in (3.17)-(3.20). So this completes the outline of the proof of Theorem 4.
✷

We end this section by some further remarks. First of all, note that the action of the original
Chevalley generators corresponding to the positive even simple roots follows from (i = 1, . . . , n − 1)

Ei,i+1|m)r = (Ei,−i−1E−i−1,i+1 + E−i−1,i+1Ei,−i−1)|m)r,
E−i−1,−i|m)r = (E−i−1,iEi,−i + Ei,−iE−i−1,i)|m)r.

(3.28)

Hence, every even Chevalley generator makes changes in two consecutive rows of the GZ-pattern
(with already fairly complicated matrix elements). The odd Chevalley generators E¯11 and E1¯1 are
part of the set of generators of Theorem 4, and they make a change in row 1 only.

Secondly, the highest weight vector of V ([m]r) is given by the pattern in which the labels of the

top row are appropriately repeated,

It is indeed easy to see by means of the previous observation (and the basic actions of Theorem 4)
that E¯11vΛ = Ei,i+1vΛ = 0 (i = −n, . . . , −2; 1, . . . , n−1). Note that with the diagonal action (3.15)-
(3.16) one ﬁnds

4 The Lie superalgebra gl(∞|∞)

In this section and in the next one we shall deﬁne the Lie superalgebra gl(∞|∞) and construct a
class of gl(∞|∞) representations.

Consider the set of all squared inﬁnite matrices of the form

where the indices take values in the set {. . . , −3, −2, −1; 1, 2, 3, . . .} = Z∗ ≡ Z \ {0}. The inﬁnite-
dimensional general linear Lie superalgebra gl(∞|∞) = gl¯0(∞|∞) ⊕ gl¯1(∞|∞) can be deﬁned [9]
as the set of all squared inﬁnite matrices of the form (4.1) such that each matrix has only a ﬁnite
number of nonzero entries, and with grading determined by

gl¯0(∞|∞) = {(aij)| a ﬁnite number of aij ∈ C are nonzero, and aij = 0 when i · j < 0};
gl¯1(∞|∞) = {(aij)| a ﬁnite number of aij ∈ C are nonzero, and aij = 0 when i · j > 0}.

(4.2)

(4.3)

A basis for gl(∞|∞) is given by all Weyl matrices Eij (i, j ∈ Z∗). The multiplication J , K on
gl(∞|∞) is a linear extension of the relations

JEij, EklK = δjkEil − (−1)deg(Eij ) deg(Ekl)δilEkj,

i, j, k, l ∈ Z∗.

(4.4)

A Cartan subalgebra H of gl(∞|∞) is spanned by the elements Ejj (j ∈ Z∗) with a natural order
Eii < Ejj if i < j. Denote by ǫi (i ∈ Z∗) the dual basis ǫi(Ejj) = δij. The correspondence between
root vectors and roots reads

Eij ↔ ǫi − ǫj

(i 6= j,

i, j ∈ Z∗).

(4.5)

The set of elements {ǫi − ǫj|i < j (i, j ∈ Z∗)} (respectively, {ǫi − ǫj|i > j (i, j ∈ Z∗)}) are the
positive (respectively, negative) roots. The linear span of all positive root vectors {Eij|i < j} is
denoted by n+; the linear span of all negative root vectors {Eij|i < j} by n−. So n+ (respectively
n−) consists of all strictly upper (respectively lower) triangular matrices of the form (4.1).

A representation (or module) V of gl(∞|∞) is said to be a highest weight module if there exists

a vector vΛ (a highest weight vector) such that

n+vΛ = 0,

EiivΛ = mivΛ

(i ∈ Z∗).

(4.6)

The inﬁnite sequence [. . . , m−2, m−1; m1, m2, . . .] is said to be the highest weight of V .

It is beyond our purpose to study all irreducible highest weight representations of gl(∞|∞).
But in the next section we will consider an important subclass: these are inﬁnite-dimensional
analogs of the covariant representations of gl(n|n). We shall refer to this class as the “covariant
representations of gl(∞|∞)”.

13

5 A class of irreducible representations of gl(∞|∞)

In this section, we shall extend the results from Section 3 to the case n → ∞. Most aspects of
this extension are straightforward, but some arguments need more attention. The basic idea is
that the GZ-patterns (3.9) consisting of 2n rows can be extended to GZ-patterns with an inﬁnite
number of rows. However, not all such inﬁnite GZ-patterns are eligible: only the “stable” ones are
appropriate as basis vectors of an irreducible module.

Let

[m] ≡ [. . . , m−k, . . . , m−2, m−1; m1, m2, . . . , mk, . . .],

(5.1)

be a sequence of nonnegative integers such that

mi − mi+1 ∈ Z+
m−1 ≥ #{i : mi > 0, i ∈ Z>0}.

(i ∈ {. . . , −3, −2; 1, 2, . . .}),

(5.2)

The last condition is equivalent with

if m−1 = p then mi = 0(∀ i > p).

The sequence (5.1) will be considered as the highest weight of a gl(∞|∞) representation V ([m]). The
basis vectors of V ([m]) will consist of inﬁnite GZ-patterns of the type (3.9) with the sequence (5.1)
as top row. These GZ-patterns should – apart from other conditions – satisfy a stability condition.
Before giving a precise deﬁnition of the inﬁnite stable GZ-patterns, let us give an example. Consider
the pattern

.

(5.3)

Such a pattern is called stable with stability index N = 5 because for all rows with index i > N
(recall that we count rows from bottom to top) the entries in each column k (k ∈ Z∗) are the same.

We are now in a position to state the extension of the main result of Section 3.

Proposition 5 To each sequence (5.1) (see (5.2)) there corresponds an irreducible gl(∞|∞) module

are said to be the 2nth upper and the 2nth lower part of |m), respectively. Consider the subalgebra

gl(n|n) = {Eij|i, j = −n, . . . , −1; 1, . . . n} ⊂ gl(∞|∞).

(5.16)

Let e be any gl(n|n) generator or polynomial expression of gl(n|n) generators. Then e|m), |m) ∈
Υ([m]) is a linear combination of vectors from Υ([m]) with one and the same 2nth upper part
|m)up(2n).

Denote the set of all vectors (5.4) with one and the same signature [m]i, i ≥ 2n by

Υ([m]i|i ≥ 2n) ⊂ Υ([m])

and the linear span of Υ([m]i|i ≥ 2n) by

V ([m]i|i ≥ 2n) ⊂ V ([m]).

(5.17)

(5.18)

Since the subspace V ([m]i|i ≥ 2n) is gl(n|n) invariant (see (5.6)-(5.11)), it will be convenient to
deﬁne a truncation of vectors |µ) from Υ([m]i|i ≥ 2n) to their 2nth lower part. So we denote:

g(|µ)) = |µ)low(2n),

∀ |µ) ∈ Υ([m]i|i ≥ 2n).

If

Υ([m]2n) = {g(|µ)) such that |µ) ∈ Υ([m]i|i ≥ 2n)}

(5.19)

(5.20)

then g is a bijection from Υ([m]i|i ≥ 2n) to Υ([m]2n). It is straightforward to see that Υ([m]2n) is an
odd GZ basis of a covariant tensor representation of gl(n|n) with highest weight [m]2n. Deﬁne the

17

action of gl(n|n) on |m) ∈ Υ([m]2n) by (3.15)-(3.20). Now the linear span V ([m]2n) of Υ([m]2n) is a
covariant tensor representation of gl(n|n) with highest weight [m]2n. Comparing the relations (5.6)-
(5.11) with (3.15)-(3.20) we have that V ([m]i|i ≥ 2n) ⊂ V ([m]) is a covariant tensor representation
of gl(n|n) with signature [m]2n and an odd GZ basis Υ([m]i|i ≥ 2n) .

Let Eij, Ekl be any two generators of gl(∞|∞) and |m) ∈ Υ([m]) be an arbitrary vector. For
n ≥ max(|i|, |j|, |k|, |l|), consider Eij, Ekl as generators of gl(n|n) ⊂ gl(∞|∞). Then |m) will be a
vector from the gl(n|n) covariant tensor module V ([m]i|i ≥ 2n) ⊂ V ([m]) and therefore
(EijEkl − (−1)deg(Eij ) deg(Ekl)EklEij)|m) = (δjkEil − (−1)deg(Eij ) deg(Ekl)δilEkj)|m).

(5.21)

In such a way one concludes that V ([m]) is a gl(∞|∞) module.

Next, we wish to prove irreducibility of V ([m]). Consider any two vectors x, y ∈ V ([m])

x =

j

Xi=1

αi|mi),

y =

p

Xi=j+1

αi|mi),

|mi) ∈ Υ([m]), αi ∈ C, i ∈ 1, . . . p.

(5.22)

Let

˜N = max{N [|mi)]|i = 1, . . . , p}.

(5.23)
Then all vectors |mi) with i = 1, . . . , p have one and the same k signatures, for k > ˜N and
|mi) ∈ V ([m]k|k > ˜N ) ⊂ V ([m]). Therefore x, y ∈ V ([m]k|k > ˜N ). The space V ([m]k|k > ˜N )
is a covariant tensor module of gl( ˜N | ˜N ) and hence there exists a polynomial expression P in the
generators of gl( ˜N | ˜N ) such that y = P x. The conclusion is that V ([m]) is an irreducible gl(∞|∞)
module.

Consider the vector | ˆm) ∈ Υ([m]) (see (5.12)). From (5.6)-(5.7) we have

In addition (see the arguments in the proof of Theorem 4)

Eii| ˆm) = mi,

∀i ∈ Z∗.

E¯11| ˆm) = Ei,i+1| ˆm) = 0 for all i = . . . , −3, −2; 1, 2, . . . .

(5.24)

(5.25)

Following (4.6), the irreducible gl(∞|∞) module V ([m]) is a highest weight module with highest
weight vector | ˆm).
✷

To summarize the paper, we have developed a new GZ-basis for covariant representations of
the Lie superalgebra gl(n|n) according to the chain of Lie superalgebras (1.2). The corresponding
GZ-patterns have a nice structure with a left and a right triangular array playing an equivalent role.
The set of generators of gl(n|n) for which an action on the GZ-basis can be computed consists of
odd root vectors only. The main characteristic of the new GZ-basis is that it can easily be extended
to the inﬁnite rank Lie superalgebra gl(∞|∞), which is not the case for the familiar GZ-basis [8]
of gl(n|n).

There is one ﬁnal property of the class of covariant representations of gl(n|n) or gl(∞|∞) that
we have not mentioned yet, and that is unitarity.
Indeed, introduce an inner product h , i in
every gl(n|n) module V ([m]r) or in every gl(∞|∞) module V ([m]), by imposing that the GZ-basis
is orthonormal. Then it follows from the explicit actions (3.15)-(3.20) or (5.6)-(5.11) that these
modules are unitary with respect to the star relation

E∗

ij = Eji

for all indices i and j. Unitarity is an important property in a physical context, in particular for
the application that we have in mind: the description of a parastatistics Fock space with an inﬁnite
number of parafermions and parabosons.

Appendix

The identity (3.27) can easily be proved using standard interpolation theory. For the notation and
results, see any elementary book on interpolation, e.g. [19].

For a function f (x), the interpolation polynomial pn(x), of degree n in x, through the distinct

points (x0, f (x0)), (x1, f (x1)), . . . , (xn, f (xn)) is given by

n

pn(x) =

f (xi)Li(x),

(A.1)

where the Li(x) are the Lagrange polynomials of degree n:

Li(x) =

(x − xj)
(xi − xj)

.

n

Yj=0

j6=i

When the function f is at least (n + 1) times diﬀerentiable, the error term (or remainder term) is
written as follows:

f (x) = pn(x) +

f (n+1)(ξ)
(n + 1)!

(x − x0)(x − x1) · · · (x − xn),

(A.2)

where ξ belongs to the interval containing the data points x0, . . . , xn.

Now, let f be the function

n

which is itself a polynomial of degree n + 1. Then f (n+1)(x) = (n + 1)!, and (A.1)-(A.2) yields:

f (x) =
