We discuss the motivations, diﬃculties and progress in the study of supersymmetric
lattice gauge theories focusing in particular on N = 1 and N = 4 super Yang-Mills
in four dimensions. Brief reviews of the corresponding lattice formalisms are given and
current results are presented and discussed. We conclude with a summary of the main
aspects of current work and prospects for the future.

1. Why study supersymmetric theories using lattice gauge theory?

There are several reasons why supersymmetry has played such an important and
prominent role in modern developments of quantum ﬁeld theory. One is its versa-
tility in constructing extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Super-
symmetry provides a solution to the hierarchy problem by providing a mechanism
for the cancellation of bosonic and fermionic contributions to quantities such as the
Higgs mass and as a bonus it includes natural candidates for dark matter. Further-
more, supersymmetric extensions of the standard model have implications at scales
that are testable by current collider experiments. At the more fundamental level
supersymmetry provides a bridge between the standard model and descriptions of
quantum gravity based on supergravity and string theory.

Supersymmetric extensions of the standard model like the MSSM are based on
softly broken supersymmetric theories and the relations to the experimental data
are usually established by perturbative calculations. In general there are very many
of these soft breaking terms (approximately one hundred in the MSSM) and this
yields to a lack of predictability in such theories. It is generally believed that such
softly broken theories should be thought of as eﬀective ﬁeld theories describing the
low energy behavior of a theory in which dynamical supersymmetry breaking has
taken place at some high scale and in some hidden sector. Presumably this breaking
arises as a consequence of some presently poorly understood strong dynamics. In

principle lattice simulations of such strongly coupled supersymmetric theories can
allow one to measure such soft parameters in terms of a handful of non-perturbative
quantities in a manner similar to the way lattice QCD allows for the prediction of
the low energy constants of chiral eﬀective theory. En route to this ambitious goal
one must ﬁrst understand the supersymmetric analog of the pure glue sector of
QCD – N = 1 super Yang-Mills theory (SYM). Numerical studies of this theory
forms a major focus of this review. The extension of this theory to include fermions
in the fundamental representation of the gauge group - super QCD - is currently too
diﬃcult for direct simulation in four dimensions. However we do discuss numerical
work that has been done in two dimensional super QCD.

A second motivation for the study of supersymmetric theories is that they arise
rather naturally in systems including gravity in particular string theory. Of spe-
ciﬁc interest in this regard are the holographic dualities which link the solution
of classical gravitational systems with the strongly coupled behavior of planar su-
persymmetric gauge theories. N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory furnishes the ﬁrst
and best understood example of such a correspondence and numerical studies of
this theory using novel lattice actions which preserve an element of supersymmetry
form a second major strand of this review.

Supersymmetry allows a better analytic understanding of quantum eﬀects and
oﬀers, therefore, an interesting new perspective for the investigations of strongly
coupled theories. An example are the exact predictions,1, 2 extensive semiclassical
analysis,3 and conjectured relations to QCD4 for N = 1 SYM. The veriﬁcation and
extension of the theoretical considerations is a further motivation for the numerical
studies of supersymmetric theories. We elaborate a little bit more on this in the
section about the results in N = 1 SYM.
In the following we provide a short summary of four dimensional supersymmetric
theories in the continuum to clarify the discussion. The on-shell action of N = 1
SYM has the following form

N = 4 SYM in four dimensions is derived from a dimensional reduction of N = 1
SYM in ten dimensions. The ten dimensional theory contains one Majorana-Weyl
fermion that is reduced to four Majorana fermions and the six additional gauge ﬁeld
components become scalar ﬁelds in the adjoint representation. The action consists
of SSYM with four fermion ﬂavors, Yukawa interactions with the six scalar ﬁelds Xi
that couple the diﬀerent fermion ﬂavors, and a bosonic action

2. Challenges with supersymmetric theories on the lattice

The simulation of supersymmetric theories presents diﬃculties above and beyond
those commonly encountered in for example lattice QCD. These additional prob-
lems derive from the nature of supersymmetry itself as the only non-trivial extension
of the usual symmetries of spacetime. A consequence of this fact is that the sym-
metry connects each fermion in the theory with a corresponding boson possessing
the same quantum numbers. This presents a problem since fermions and bosons
are usually handled diﬀerently in lattice simulations. Further considerations are re-
lated to common features of many supersymmetric theories: the bosonic potential
in theories with extended supersymmetry naturally includes ﬂat directions which
must be regulated if they are to yield stable simulations. Additionally the fermion
representations that commonly arise in these theories can lead to technical or even
severe sign problems.

2.1. Supersymmetry breaking by the lattice discretization

Supersymmetry is connected with the symmetries of space time, which is commonly
expressed in the terms of the simpliﬁed part of the supersymmetry algebra

{Q, Q} ∝ Pµ ,

(4)

where Q are the generators of supersymmetry and Pµ the generators of translation.
The lattice has no inﬁnitesimal translation and, like the symmetries of space-time,
supersymmetry is broken by the lattice discretization. Typically, the remnant lattice
symmetry ensures the restoration of the full space-time symmetry, but supersym-
metry remains broken.

In a more detailed investigation one ﬁnds that the symmetry breaking is related
to the violation of the Leibniz rule by any discrete derivative operator.5–7 The su-
persymmetry transformation of the action with the fermionic parameter  generates
terms of the form

γµ

d4x [(∂µφ1)φ2ψ + φ1(∂µφ2)ψ + φ1φ2(∂µψ)] =

d4x ∂µV µ ,

(5)

(cid:90)

where the Leibniz (or chain) rule is applied to identify it with a total derivative.
The only way to maintain the Leibniz rule on the lattice and implement supersym-
metry fully is by non-local derivative and product operators. Hence either locality

or supersymmetry are violated on the lattice. This resembles the Nielsen-Ninomiya
theorem8 concerning the problem of constructing chiral lattice gauge theories. For
chiral symmetry the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, a modiﬁed symmetry relation on the
lattice, provides a practicable and general solution. In its general form it reads

where the left hand side is the variation of the lattice action S under the general
transformation φi → φi +M ijφj and the right hand side corresponds to a controlled
breaking by a blocking kernel α. It reduces to a simple expression for chiral sym-
metry, but in the case of supersymmetry, no practicable solutions have yet been
found.9

Since there is no generic solution, the representation of supersymmetry on the
lattice is hence a model dependent issue. In general ﬁne-tuning ensures the restora-
tion of the symmetry in the continuum limit. In models with extended supersym-
metry, the implementation of a part of the symmetry algebra ensures a signiﬁcant
reduction of this ﬁne-tuning.

2.2. Fermion doubling and fermion mass

The fermion doubling problem is a well-known diﬃculty for the correct represen-
tation of fermionic ﬁelds on the lattice. The background of this problem is the
Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, which states that locality and chiral symmetry can not
be maintained without the introduction of additional fermionic degrees of freedom
- the doublers. Furthermore the ﬁnal lattice theory is then necessarily vectorlike.

Basically there are three options: one can employ non-trivial lattice fermion ac-
tions such as the lattice K¨ahler-Dirac action or (reduced) staggered fermion action.
This option is only open for certain theories which possess extended supersymmetry
where the additional fermions that arise in these formulations can be interpreted as
the correct number of continuum physical ﬂavors.

Alternatively one can consider additional momentum dependent mass terms,
like the Wilson mass term, that remove the doubling modes in the continuum limit.
These terms violate the equality between bosonic and fermionic masses unless they
are introduced also in the bosonic sector.10, 11 Bosons and fermions are then treated
on the same footing with the same derivative operators and mass terms. The dou-
bling problem is also introduced for the bosonic ﬁelds and, like for the fermions, the
unphysical degrees of freedom are removed by additional mass terms. These mass
terms can be consistently introduced in the superpotential corresponding to a mod-
iﬁcation of m in (2). Hence not only the mass, but also higher vertices (proportional
to mg in (2)) are modiﬁed in the on-shell formulation. The mass term breaks not
only chiral symmetry but also corresponding bosonic symmetries. The application
of this method for gauge ﬁelds, especially in a compact formulation, is not possible.
A third option is to allow for nonlocal lattice actions. This might be a solution
in lower dimensional theories without gauge ﬁelds. In the general case there is no

proof of a well behaved continuum limit for a theory that violates locality.

2.3. Flat directions

In theories with extended supersymmetry there are generically ﬂat directions of the
bosonic potential introduced by commutator terms of ﬁelds in the adjoint repre-
sentation, see (3). Such kinds of terms arise naturally in a dimensional reduction
of pure Yang-Mills theories. In these pure bosonic cases the classical ﬂat directions
get usually lifted by quantum eﬀects. Supersymmetry leads, however, to cancella-
tions between the bosonic and fermionic contributions and the ﬂat directions can
survive in the quantum theory.12 These eﬀects are generically diﬃcult to handle in
numerical simulations - for example they can become unstable due to ﬁnite tem-
perature or lattice artifacts or the simulations may not be eﬃcient at exploring the
ﬂat directions.13 One approach that has proven eﬀective in theories with some exact
supersymmetry (see later) is to modify the lattice action to include additional scalar
mass terms that lift the ﬂat directions and to subsequently investigate the behavior
of the observables when these regulator terms are removed.14

2.4. Sign problem in supersymmetric theories

The Witten index measures the diﬀerence between bosonic and fermionic ground
states in a supersymmetric theory. If it is zero the theory can exhibit spontaneous
supersymmetry breaking. It is deﬁned as

˜Z = Tr(cid:2)(−1)F e

−βH(cid:3) ,

(7)
where, in contrast to the thermal partition function, (−1)F includes a minus sign
for fermionic states of the Hamiltonian H. It corresponds to a twisted partition
function that is the sum of all diﬀerences between fermionic and bosonic energy
states. The usual thermal partition function employs periodic boundary conditions
for the bosons and antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions in one com-
pact direction that corresponds to the temperature. The twisted partition function
has, instead, periodic boundary conditions for all ﬁelds. If the Witten index is zero,
there must necessarily be the same number of negative and positive contributions
from the conﬁgurations in the path integral with periodic boundary conditions.
This means a severe sign problem, or a zero by zero division in the computation of
observables.15 A simple way to reduce, but not completely resolve, this sign prob-
lem is the application of supersymmetry breaking antiperiodic boundary conditions
for fermion ﬁelds with a subsequent extrapolation to the zero temperature contin-
uum limit.16 More elaborate solutions are based on loop representations and Worm
algorithms.17

Even in the case of a non-zero Witten index, a mild sign problem appears in
several supersymmetric theories. In this case the negative contributions might be
introduced by the discretization and disappear in the continuum limit. One exam-
ple is N = 1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Using Wilson fermions negative

contributions from the Pfaﬃan are possible. They are enhanced towards the chiral
limit, but suppressed in the continuum limit. In general it is relatively simple to
handle these kind of sign problems, either by reweighting or by avoiding the critical
parameter range. The only remaining challenge is the measurement of the Pfaﬃan
sign.

3. Solutions

3.1. Fine tuning

The fact that typical lattice actions break supersymmetry leads to a proliferation
of supersymmetry breaking counterterms in the eﬀective action describing the ef-
fects of quantum corrections. In general there are a large number of such relevant
counterterms. To approach a supersymmetric continuum limit then requires that all
such terms be added to the bare lattice action and their coeﬃcients carefully tuned
as the lattice spacing is reduced. This is the famous ﬁne tuning problem of lattice
supersymmetry.

This approach is particularly simple for super-renormalizable theories, where
the coeﬃcients can be calculated perturbatively. One of the earliest examples is the
two dimensional Wess-Zumino model.18 In supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories the
possible counterterms are restricted by the gauge symmetry and the remnant space-
time symmetry on the lattice. In N = 1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory there
is only one remaining counterterm: the gluino mass term.19 It is the same tuning
that is needed for the restoration of chiral symmetry in the continuum limit. The
numerical determination of the coeﬃcient is feasible and can be done using either
the supersymmetric or the chiral Ward identities. If the fermion action fulﬁlls the
Ginsparg-Wilson relation, both chiral symmetry and supersymmetry are ensured in
the continuum limit.

The ﬁne tuning is considerably more diﬃcult in theories with scalar ﬁelds. These
are part of the matter multiplet in supersymmetric QCD or appear in the vec-
tor multiplet alongside the gauge ﬁeld in theories with extended supersymmetry.
If Ginsparg-Wilson fermions are employed, a combined tuning of several diﬀerent
counterterms needs to be done.20 It might be guided by perturbative arguments as
shown for the Wess-Zumino model21 and for N = 2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills the-
ory.22 In theories which preserve part of the supersymmetry algebra it is sometimes
possible to reduce the number of ﬁne tunings dramatically. A particular example of
this is N = 4 super Yang-Mills where a single tuning is all that is required to target
the correct continuum theory.

3.2. Preserving part of the supersymmetry algebra

While discretization of supersymmetric theories generically breaks supersymmetry
completely there are situations where a subalgebra can be preserved. In many cases
the existence of this subalgebra places strong constraints on the possible counter

term structure of the theory and can reduce or even eliminate the ﬁne tuning prob-
lem that has been described earlier.

These cases all involve theories with extended supersymmetry - in fact in the
case of pure super Yang-Mills theories the precise constraint is that the number of
real fermionic degrees of freedom must be 2D where D is the (Euclidean) spacetime
dimension.

3.2.1. Two dimensional super Yang-Mills

Let us see how this works in perhaps the simplest example: (2, 2) super Yang-Mills in
two dimensions.23–25 The ﬁeld content of this theory corresponds to two degenerate
ﬂavors of Majorana fermions λI , I = 1 . . . 2, two scalar ﬁelds BI and a gauge ﬁeld
Ai, i = 1, 2. The global symmetries of the theory include SOLorentz(2) and a ﬂavor
symmetry SOﬂavor(2) and allow one to decompose the ﬁelds of the theory under a
twisted rotational symmetry corresponding to the diagonal subgroup

(cid:48)
SO

(2) = Diag (SOLorentz(2) × SOﬂavor(2))

Under this twisted symmetry the fermions transform like a 2d matrix Λ

with G a SO(2) transformation. Given this matrix structure it is then natural to
expand Λ on products of two dimensional gamma matrices

Λ = ηI + ψiσi + χ12σ1σ2

(10)

The appearance of the scalar fermion η is crucial - it implies the existence of a
scalar supersymmetry Q and from the original supersymmetry algebra it is easy
to show that Q satisﬁes the subalgebra {Q,Q} = 0. The absence of a generator of
translations on the RHS of this expression means that this supercharge can coexist
with a discrete lattice. Indeed it is possible to show that the action of the theory
can be written in a Q-exact form

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

S = Q

(11)

The gauge ﬁeld A entering in this expression is not the original gauge ﬁeld but a
complexiﬁed ﬁeld taking the form Ai = Ai +iBi containing the original scalar ﬁelds.
This arises because of the twisting procedure; the scalar ﬁelds transform as a vector
under the original ﬂavor symmetry and hence will also behave as a vector under the
twisted rotational symmetry. Conversely, the original gauge ﬁeld was a singlet under
the ﬂavor symmetry so remains a vector under the twisted symmetry. Finally the
bosonic ﬁeld d is introduced to render the Q symmetry nilpotent oﬀ-shell. Indeed

March 16, 2016 0:23 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

16susyreview

8 G. Bergner and S. Catterall

the scalar supersymmetry transformations take the simple form

QAi = ψi
Q ψi = 0
QAi = 0
Q χij = −F ij
Q η = d
Q d = 0

(12)

Notice that Q2 = 0 on all ﬁelds as advertised. The complex Ai yields complexiﬁed
covariant derivatives Di = ∂i + iAi, Di = ∂i + iAi and associated ﬁeld strengths
Fij = [Di,Dj].
So far the discussion has taken place in the continuum and the entire twisting
process in ﬂat space can be envisioned as merely an exotic change of variables. How-
ever it clearly oﬀers some advantages when it comes to discretization; the twisted
theory no longer contains any spinors which makes it possible to avoid the usual
fermion doubling problem. Indeed after doing the Q-variation the fermionic part
of the action describes a K¨ahler-Dirac fermion which can be discretized without
inducing fermion doubling. In fact the resultant action can be mapped into that of
(reduced) staggered fermions. Furthermore and most importantly the scalar super-
symmetry can be restricted to a lattice without paying any penalty.

In more detail the transcription to a lattice requires ﬁrst assigning continuum
ﬁelds to links in a lattice. The lattice is not arbitrary; in the example in question one
requires a lattice with both the usual unit basis vectors in the coordinate directions
x → x+ˆi for Ai and its superpartner ψi but also diagonal or face links running from
x +ˆi + ˆj → x to carry the χij. We also need a prescription for replacing continuum
derivatives with (gauged) diﬀerence operators. Such a prescription exists and we
illustrate it below for a generic link ﬁeld fi(x)

Difj → Ui(x)fj(x + ˆi) − fj(x)Ui(x + ˆj)
Difi → fi(x)U(x) − U(x − ˆi)fi(x − ˆi)

(13)

In this expression we have replaced the continuum Ai by a complex lattice Wil-
son link ﬁeld Ui. Notice that these expressions ensure that the derivatives gauge
transform like appropriate link paths and have the correct naive continuum limit if
Ui = I +Ai + . . . Furthermore, notice that this deﬁnition means that Fij = DiUj is
automatically antisymmetric in its indices and remarkably satisﬁes an exact Bianchi
identity ijklDiFjk = 0.
Using the exact symmetries of the lattice action allows one to strongly constrain
the possible relevant counter terms that can appear in the lattice eﬀective action.
The Q symmetry is particularly important in this regard. Consider the one loop
eﬀective action gotten by expanding the gauge ﬁelds about a generic classical vac-
uum state Ui = I + ai +Ai where ai is a diagonal constant matrix corresponding to
one of the ﬂat directions in the theory. It is not hard to show that the Pfaﬃan that

results from integration over the twisted fermions cancels a corresponding bosonic
determinant and so the one loop eﬀective action Γ(ai) is zero because of supersym-
metry. However this result in fact holds to all orders; it turns out that the vacuum
expectation value of any Q-invariant operator is independent of the coupling con-
stant and hence can be evaluated exactly at one loop. The proof is straightforward.
Consider

(15)

(cid:90)

This result ensures that no scalar potential appears to any order in perturbation
theory; the scalars remain massless and the ﬂat directions survive quantum correc-
tion. In addition fermion masses are also suppressed; gauge invariance requires any
operator to take the form of a closed loop. Relevant operators correspond to loops
of minimal length; most of these correspond to kinetic terms already appearing in
i U iUi.
However this term lifts the ﬂat directions and so is prohibited by the proceeding
argument if it is not present in the classical action26, 27

the classical action; the only exception being a term of the form QTr η(cid:80)

Let me wrap up this section by summarizing the key diﬀerences between this
approach and more conventional lattice formulations of (supersymmetric) gauge
theories.

• Fermions live in the algebra. To maintain supersymmetry so must the gauge
ﬁelds. This implies that the one must employ a ﬂat measure rather than
the Haar measure in the path integral. This is very diﬀerent from lattice
QCD. The usual problems of maintaining gauge invariance are avoided since
the links are complexiﬁed and hence the ﬂat measure DUDU is still gauge
invariant.
• The correct naive continuum limit requires that the Ui = I +Ai + . . .. With
a group valued link ﬁeld the unit matrix appearing here is automatic but
when the variables reside in the algebra it needs to arise by giving a vacuum
expectation value to a dynamical ﬁeld in the theory. Luckily since the gauge
group is GL(N, C) this can be arranged by letting the trace mode of the
(untwisted) scalar ﬁeld take on such a vev. In practice we guarantee this
by adding a soft supersymmetry breaking term to the action of the form

(cid:80)

x,i

(cid:2) 1
N Tr (Ui(x)U i(x)) − 1(cid:3)2

• Supersymmetry forces fermions to be assigned to links like their superpart-
ners the gauge ﬁelds. This is diﬀerent from lattice QCD. In addition the
fermions are treated as K¨ahler-Dirac ﬁelds. Fermion doubling is avoided by
a careful discretization procedure of the latter.

3.2.2. Super QCD

Remarkably the previous constructions can be generalized to include fermions and
scalars transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. The
trick is to start from a lattice super Yang-Mills theory in one higher dimension
with at least one scalar supercharge. One then restricts the extra dimension so that
it contains only two timeslices and gauge those two timeslices under two indepen-
dent gauge groups U (C) and U (F ). To maintain gauge invariance the links running
between these two timeslices must now contain ﬁelds which transform in the bifun-
damental representation of the combined gauge group U (C) × U (F ). Furthermore
the extra dimensional gauge ﬁeld will behave as a scalar with respect the twisted
rotational symmetry of each timeslice. Finally the gauge coupling for say the U (F )
theory is sent to zero resulting in a theory containing both (twisted) gauge ﬁelds and
fermions in the adjoint representation of U (C) (a vector multiplet) together with F
scalars and fermions in the the fundamental representation of that group (F hyper-
multiplets). All ﬁelds on the U (F ) timeslice can then be consistently truncated from
the theory. A single exact supercharge remains and constrains the renormalization
of the lattice theory.

The key result which makes this construction possible is a generalization of the
prescription used in the case of adjoint ﬁelds to replace covariant derivatives by
covariant ﬁnite diﬀerence operators to the case of bifundamental ﬁelds. Consider a
bifundamental fermion ψµ which one can think of as a rectangular C × F matrix
and which transforms as

ψµ(x) → G(x)ψµH(x + ˆµ) where G ∈ U (C) and H ∈ U (F )

A lattice derivative can be deﬁned as

Dµψν(x) = Uµ(x)ψν(x + ˆµ) − ψν(x)Vµ(x + ˆν)

(16)

(17)

where Uµ is the U (C) gauge ﬁeld and Vµ the U (F ) gauge ﬁeld. This forms a gauge in-
variant loop when traced with the bifundamental F ×C rectangular fermion χµν(x).
Using these techniques one could study three dimensional super QCD but unfor-
tunately not four dimensions since in the latter case one would need to start from
a ﬁve dimensional theory with a single exact supercharge which does not exist.

3.3. Nonlocal lattice actions

Locality is one of the basic principles that is usually required in quantum ﬁeld theo-
ries. On the other hand nonlocal lattice actions can sometimes allow us to preserve
supersymmetry and circumvent the fermion doubling problem. The perturbative
calculations in four dimensional gauge theories with nonlocal lattice actions have
shown that nonlocal counterterms are required to achieve a local continuum limit.28
This is one of the basic arguments why nonlocal lattice actions are considered as
unusable in lattice simulations.

Supersymmetry on the lattice

11

On the other hand in low dimensional Wess-Zumino models the correct local
continuum limit of the nonlocal lattice actions can be shown in perturbation the-
ory.29 The perturbative proof is valid up to three dimensions.30 In four dimensions
nonlocal lattice representations of the Wess-Zumino model have been proposed that
include an enhanced but incomplete symmetry.31 The eﬀects of the locality viola-
tion have been investigated in numerical simulations.32 Numerical evidence shows
that the breaking is not severe.

The violation of locality has more severe consequences for gauge theories than
for Wess-Zumino models. The nonlocal contribution can be introduced in terms of
a sharp momentum cutoﬀ for all ﬁelds, which leads, in case of the gauge ﬁelds,
to a violation of gauge invariance. Considering only a nonlocal fermion action to
resolve the doubling problem, gauge invariance requires gauge transports at all
distances. Hence it appears that at least for supersymmetric gauge theories and
supersymmetric QCD, especially in four dimensions, this approach is not applicable.

4. Applications and Results

4.1. Wess-Zumino models and supersymmetric Yang-Mills

theories in less than four dimensions

As explained in Section 3.1 and 3.3 the ﬁne tuning problem is much simpler in lower
dimensional theories and even non-local lattice actions can be considered, at least
in the case of Wess-Zumino models.

These theories have been studied as toy models to investigate supersymmetry
breaking on the lattice. Wess-Zumino models in particular are interesting candidates
for these kind of investigations. A large number of theoretical approaches have
been taken to realize lattice formulations of these models. Numerical investigations
with naive and improved discretizations and also featuring partial realization of the
supersymmetry have been done.10, 15, 29 Particular interesting from the conceptual
point of view are approaches based on the Nicolai map, which maps the interacting
theory to a free theory.33 The one and two dimensional Wess-Zumino models also
serve as useful arenas for investigating spontaneous supersymmetry breaking.16, 17, 34
In addition to serving as toy models for understanding the general problem of
lattice supersymmetry low dimensional models can also have interesting applica-
tions in gauge-gravity duality – ﬁnite temperature super Yang-Mills models in one,
two and three dimensions and in the planar limit are conjectured to be dual to
certain supergravity theories containing black holes. Moving away from the planar
limit allows the Yang-Mills simulations to tell us something about quantum and
string corrections in these theories. These topics will be covered in more detail by
a diﬀerent contribution to this issue.

for non-perturbative investigations; not only due to its relevance in extensions of
the standard model, but also because of the various theoretical considerations and
predictions for this theory.36 The theory consists of the usual gluonic Yang-Mills
theory with the fermionic counterparts, the gluinos. At a ﬁrst glance, the theory
looks quite similar to the massless limit of one-ﬂavor QCD albeit with Majorana
fermions in the adjoint representation. Besides supersymmetry, the theory has an
U(1) R-symmetry, which corresponds the chiral symmetry group of a theory with
one fermion ﬂavor. The anomaly breaks this symmetry to a discrete Z2Nc subgroup
in the case of an SU(Nc) gauge group. This remaining symmetry is broken by a
fermion condensate down to Z2.

At low energies the gluinos and gluons are conﬁned in strongly bound states.
If supersymmetry is unbroken, the bound state spectrum should be composed of
supersymmetry multiplets. These multiples consist of a bosonic scalar, a bosonic
pseudoscalar, and a fermionic particle with the same mass. Low energy eﬀective
theories have been constructed with the ﬁrst multiplet of gluonic type, where the
bosonic operators are glueballs, and a second one of mesonic type, with meson like
gluino-ball operators as bosonic constituents.37–39 Further interesting predictions
for N = 1 SYM are the exact value of the gluino condensate and the all order beta
function.1, 2

As explained in Section 3.1, the restoration of supersymmetry in the contin-
uum limit can be achieved relatively easily in this theory. Using Ginsparg-Wilson
fermions, it is obtained without ﬁne tuning. For Wilson fermions a single ﬁne tuning
of the fermion mass is suﬃcient. In practice, the best signal for the ﬁne tuning is
the breaking of chiral symmetry in terms of the adjoint pion mass. This particle is
deﬁned in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory.40

In addition to these theoretical considerations one has to face several technical
challenges in the simulations of N = 1 SYM. The theory contains a Majorana

fermion (in the adjoint representation) which yields a Pfaﬃan after integrating out
the fermions unlike the usual determinant encountered in lattice QCD. Even if the
determinant can be proven positive this is not necessarily true for the Pfaﬃan and
so this theory suﬀers from a sign problem. In practice this is not too severe and
can be handled using reweighting techniques. In addition, the bound states of the
theory are either gluonic observables or ﬂavor singlet mesonic states, both of them
are rather hard to measure.

Compared to the determination of the bound state spectrum, the measurement
of the gluino condensate can be performed more easily. In the ﬁrst investigations
using Wilson fermions the chiral phase transition was determined from the two peak
structure of the histogram of the condensate.41 However, with Wilson fermions
this quantity includes additive and multiplicative renormalization and therefore
investigations with Ginsparg-Wilson fermions are favored. Interesting results have
been obtained using simulations with domain wall fermions.42, 43

The determination of the bound state spectrum is a more challenging task and it
has so far only been done with Wilson fermions. While the ﬁrst preliminary investi-
gations can be found in44 some more recent results are presented in.45 These latter
results proﬁt from improved dynamical fermion algorithms and incorporate extrap-
olations to the chiral limit, but they have found a rather large splitting between the
bosonic and fermionic components of the lowest multiplet. A careful analysis of the
lattice artifacts and the ﬁnite size eﬀects was necessary to resolve this issue.46, 47
The ﬁnal results are consistent with the formation of a multiplet of bound states,35
see Figure 1.

The pure N = 1 SYM has a number of interesting applications and the lattice
simulations might conﬁrm the theoretical conjectures about this theory. The ﬁrst
lattice simulations of SU(2) N = 1 SYM at ﬁnite temperature have found a sec-
ond order deconﬁnement transition at around 0.8(Tc)YM compared to the critical
temperature in pure SU(2) Yang Mills theory (Tc)YM. The chiral phase transition
happens at around the same temperature.48

Recent theoretical investigations consider compactiﬁed N = 1 SYM on R3 × S1.
Instead of the thermal boundary conditions, which are antiperiodic for the fermions
and periodic for the bosons, periodic boundary conditions are applied in the com-
pactiﬁed direction. In this compactiﬁed theory no phase transition expected even
down to a small radius, where the theory can be understood by means of a semiclas-
sical analysis.3 Lattice simulations were able to identify indications of the expected
continuity.49, 50 One interesting example is shown in Figure 2. With thermal bound-
ary conditions the quantity  corresponds to the volume averaged derivative of the
partition function with respect to the temperature and provides information about
the equation of state. With periodic boundary conditions, it is a derivative of the
twisted partition function and corresponds to a sum of diﬀerences between bosonic
and fermionic energy levels. Hence this measurement provides an indication about
the absence of the phase transition with periodic boundary conditions and about

the smallness of the remnant supersymmetry breaking on the lattice.

Fig. 2. This Figure shows a comparison of the derivative of the thermal partition function and
the twisted partition function for SU(2) N = 1 SYM. In contrast to the thermal case, periodic
boundary conditions are applied for the fermions in the twisted partition function.50 The temper-
ature is identiﬁed with 1/R, where R is the compactiﬁcation radius of the compactiﬁed theory on
R3 × S1. The simulations have been done with a tree level clover improved fermion action and an
adjoint pion mass of around amπ (cid:39) 0.6.

4.3. N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
The twisting procedure described in Section 3.2 can be applied to N = 4 Yang-
Mills and results in a lattice theory which retains one exact supercharge at non zero
lattice spacing. The action for this lattice theory is very similar to that given in the
two dimensional example - see for example the review25

the continuum limit in which all the supersymmetries are restored.51 One should
place a caveat on this result; the relevance of any operator depends on a power
counting argument using the engineering dimension of a ﬁeld - it is possible that at
strong coupling large anomalous dimensions can be generated and modify the set
of relevant operators. As we have discussed it is necessary to add a soft Q-breaking

terminant of the plaquette away from unity. Since this modiﬁcation of the action

is supersymmetric the violations of Q Ward identities are small as can be seen in
Figure 3 which compares the improved action over an earlier iteration where the
monopoles are suppressed in a way which breaks supersymmetry.

Using a parallelized code based on the MILC libraries52 we are currently using
lattice simulation to probe the structure of N = 4 Yang-Mills at strong coupling and
for small numbers of colors. This is a regime inaccessible to analytic computations
which typically require taking the planar limit. It allows us to search for signs of
S-duality53, 54 and to test the bounds on anomalous dimensions provided by the
conformal bootstrap program.55 One of the central features of N = 4 Yang-Mills

that we would like to reproduce is the fact that it is conformal for any value of
the gauge coupling. To this end we have computed the static potential V (r) from
the correlators of Wilson lines (after gauge ﬁxing). We ﬁnd that ﬁts to the form
V (r) = σr+ C
r always yield a string tension σ ∼ 0 within errors - see Figure 4. This is
consistent with the system being in a conformal phase for all couplings. Furthermore,
the Coulomb coeﬃcient C is found to agree with perturbative estimates at weak
coupling. Further evidence in favor of conformality can be found by examining the
behavior of two point functions of would be conformal operators in the theory. The
simplest of these is the Konishi operator - the ﬂavor singlet quadratic scalar operator

dimension as a function of the ’t Hooft coupling to compare with results in the planar
limit56 and bounds from the conformal bootstrap approach.55 Preliminary results
obtained from a Monte Carlo renormalization group analysis are in agreement with
perturbative calculations at weak coupling.

4.4. Towards supersymmetric QCD
N = 1 supersymmetric QCD is obtained when the supersymmetric pure gauge the-
ory presented in Section 4.2 is coupled to a Wess-Zumino model with ﬁelds in the
fundamental representation. The complete solution for the correct representation
of the four dimensional Wess-Zumino model on the lattice without ﬁne tuning are
so far unknown, but ﬁrst results indicate, that constructions guided by perturba-
tive arguments might oﬀer a reasonable solution.32 Supersymmetric QCD in four
dimension requires a large number of terms to be ﬁne tuned in the continuum limit
and the practical applicability of the ﬁne tuning program is so far unknown. Similar
considerations also hold for N = 2 SYM in four dimensions.

It is therefore instructive to study ﬁrst an example in two dimensions, where as

where φ is the bifundamental scalar resulting from dimensional reduction in the
extra dimension and the trace runs over C colors. Whether one can set this potential
to zero (and hence ﬁnd a supersymmetric vacuum) depends on the rank of the C×C
matrix φφ. One expects for F ≥ C that a supersymmetric vacuum is possible while
for F < C dynamical supersymmetry breaking should occur. The numerical results
in57 bear this out and also ﬁnd evidence for a Goldstino in the latter case. Figure 6
plots the bosonic action which can be obtained via a Q Ward identity in both cases.
The solid line indicates the result expected for a theory in which supersymmetry
is not broken. Clearly the numerical results are completely in agreement with the
theoretical arguments based on the rank of scalar potential.

Supersymmetry on the lattice

5. Conclusions

In this brief review we have listed some of the problems faced when studying super-
symmetric theories on lattices. In general supersymmetry will be broken completely
and one faces a ﬁne tuning problem to regain a supersymmetric theory in the limit
in which the lattice spacing is sent to zero. In low dimensions this can sometimes
be avoided either by using non-local actions or by performing a ﬁnite order per-
turbative calculation to determine the coeﬃcients of the counter terms. In certain
cases this ﬁne tuning problem can be reduced or even eliminated using new lattice
actions which conserve (at least) a single supercharge. This latter situation includes
N = 4 super Yang-Mills and its dimensional reductions. These supersymmetric
actions are discussed in some detail in the review. For N = 1 super Yang-Mills
theory the ﬁne tuning problem involves only a single coupling where it coincides
with the usual tuning needed to take the chiral limit. We present encouraging new
results from the numerical simulations of these theories, in particular concerning
the mass spectrum of N = 1 super Yang-Mills. They indicate that the theoretical
and numerical challenges are now under control and the lattice can be an interesting
tool for further non-perturbative investigations of these theories. As an example of
how theoretical conjectures can be tested, we have shown the phase transitions in
compactiﬁed N = 1 super Yang-Mills theory and the indications for a conformal
behavior in N = 4 super Yang-Mills.

While theories like super QCD remain a goal of this program, current work on
these more general theories is limited to low dimensions where encouraging results
have been obtained on models which exhibit dynamical supersymmetry breaking.
