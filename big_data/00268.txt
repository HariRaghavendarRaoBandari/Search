ERGODIC MEASURES ON COMPACT METRIC

SPACES FOR ISOMETRIC ACTIONS BY

INDUCTIVELY COMPACT GROUPS

YANQI QIU

Abstract. We obtain a partial converse of Vershik’s description
of ergodic probability measures on a compact metric space with re-
spect to an isometric action by an inductively compact group. This
allows us to identify, in this setting, the set of ergodic probability
measures with the set of weak limit points of orbital measures.

1. Introduction

A topological group is called inductively compact if it is the inductive
limit of an increasing chain of compact groups. In this note, we will
investigate the ergodic probability measures of on a compact metric
space with respect to an isometric action by an inductively compact
group.

Let K(1) ⊂ · · · ⊂ K(n) ⊂ · · · be an increasing chain of compact
groups, denote the corresponding inductive limit by K(∞). Let X
be a separable metric complete space. Assume that K(∞) acts on
X by Borel actions. By a result of Vershik, all ergodic probability
measures on X are the weak limits of orbital measures. Let us state
this more precisely. Denote by mn the normalized Haar measure on
K(n). For any point x ∈ X , we denote by µx
n the unique K(n)-invariant
probability measure on the orbit

K(n) · x = {y ∈ X : y = g · x for some g ∈ K(n)}.

Let us denote by P(X ) the set of all Borel probability measures on
X . Recall that by deﬁnition, a sequence (νn)n∈N of Borel probability
measures on X converges weakly to a Borel probability measure ν ∈
P(X ) if for any bounded continuous function f , we have

f dν = lim

n→∞ZX

f dνn.

In this situation, we denote νn =⇒ ν as n → ∞.

Theorem 1.1 (Vershik [3, Theorem 1]). Let µ be an ergodic K(∞)-
invariant Borel probability measure on X . Then for µ-almost every
point x ∈ X , we have

µx

n =⇒ µ as n → ∞.

The purpose of this note is to give a partial converse of Theorem 1.1.

Theorem 1.2. Let X be a compact metric space. Assume that K(∞)
acts on X by isometric isomorphisms. If µ ∈ P(X ) is a weak limit
point of the sequence of orbital measures (µx0

n )n∈N, then µ is ergodic.

We can strengthen Theorem 1.2 a little further as follows.

Theorem 1.3. Let X be a compact metric space. Assume that K(∞)
acts on X by isometric isomorphisms. If (xn)n∈N is a convergent se-
quence in X and if µ ∈ P(X ) is a weak limit point of the sequence of
orbital measures (µxn

n )n∈N, then µ is ergodic.

As a consequence, we have

Corollary 1.4. Let X be a compact metric space. Assume that K(∞)
acts on X by isometric isomorphisms. Then a probability measure µ ∈
P(X ) is ergodic if and only if there exists a sequence of points (xn)n∈N
in X , such that µ is a weak limit point of a sequence of orbital measures
(µxn

n )n∈N.

Remark 1.1. In some important situations, without the assumption of
compactness on the space X and without requiring that the group action
is isometric, the same result in Theorem 1.3 still holds, for instance,
see [2, Corollary 4.2].

We also provide a simple example showing that, in general, the as-

sumption that the action is isometric can not be dropped.

Proposition 1.5. There exists an inductively compact group K(∞), a
compact metric space X , on which the group K(∞) acts by homeomor-
phisms, and a sequence (xn)n∈N of points in X , such that non of the
probability measures on X that are weak limits of (µxn
n )n∈N is ergodic.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.2

Our proof is based on the following Reverse Martingale type result
from [1]. For introducing this result, we need more notation. Given
any bounded measurable function f : X → R, we may deﬁne, for any
positive integer n ∈ N, a function Anf by

(2.1)

(Anf )(x) := ZX

f dµx

n = ZK(n)

f (g · x)mn(dg).

Let ν be any K(∞)-invariant probability measure. By using the Re-
verse Martingale theorem, one may prove that the following limit

exists for ν-almost every x ∈ X . Moreover, ν is ergodic if and only if
there exists a dense subset Ψ ⊂ L1(X , µ) such that for any ψ ∈ Ψ, one
has

(2.3)

(Aν

∞ψ)(x) = ZX

ψdν, for ν-almost every x ∈ X .

See [1, Propositions 6, 7 and 8] for the details of the above statements.
Let us now proceed to the proof of Theorem 1.2. By assumption,
assume that there exists a subsequence (ni)i∈N of the natural numbers,
such that

µx0

ni =⇒ µ as i → ∞.

Note that if we replace the chain K(1) ⊂ · · · K(n) ⊂ · · · by the chain
K(n1) ⊂ · · · K(ni) ⊂ · · · , then both chains deﬁne a same inductive
limit group K(∞). By this observation, without loss of generality, we
may thus assume that

µx0

n =⇒ µ as n → ∞.

First note that if x ∈ K(∞) · x0, then

(2.4)

µx

n =⇒ µ as n → ∞.

Indeed, this follows from the elementary fact that once x ∈ K(N) · x0,
then for any n ≥ N, we have µx
n . By deﬁnition of weak con-
vergence of probability measures, for any bounded continuous function
f : X → R, we have

n = µx0

n→∞ZX

lim

f (y)µx

n(dy) = ZX

f (y)µ(dy)

(x ∈ K(∞) · x0).

In the notation (2.1), this means

(2.5)

lim
n→∞

(Anf )(x) = ZX

f dµ (x ∈ K(∞) · x0).

Since the support supp(µx
that supp(µx
K(∞) · x0. By (2.4), we get

n equals K(n) · x, we see
n) is a subset of the closure clos(K(∞) · x0) of the orbit

n) of the measure µx

(2.6)

supp(µ) ⊂ clos(K(∞) · x0).

We need the following simple lemma. Let us denote the metric on

X by dX (·, ·).

Lemma 2.1. The continuous functions in the sequence (Anf )n∈N are
equicontinuous, that is, for any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0, such that
whenever y, z ∈ X satisfy dX (y, z) ≤ δ, then

|Anf (y) − Anf (z)| ≤ ε.

n∈N

Proof. We will use the fact that the group action of K(∞) on X is an
isometric action. Since f is a continuous function on the compact space
X , it is uniformly continuous. Thus for any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0,
such that whenever y, z ∈ X satisfy dX (y, z) ≤ δ, then |f (y)−f (z)| ≤ ε.
Thus under the above condition on y, z, for any g ∈ K(∞), we have
dX (g · y, g · z) = dX (y, z) ≤ δ and hence |f (g · y) − f (g · z)| ≤ ε. It
follows that for any n ∈ N, we have

|Anf (y) − Anf (z)| ≤ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ZK(n)

f (g · y)mn(dg) − ZK(n)

f (g · z)mn(dg)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤ ε.

This proves the equicontinuity of the family of continuous functions
{Anf : n ∈ N}.
(cid:3)

By using Arzel`a-Ascoli theorem, (2.5) can actually be strengthened

to:

(2.7)

lim
n→∞

(Anf )(x) = ZX

f dµ (x ∈ clos(K(∞) · x0)).

For the sake of completeness, let us give more details for the above
assertion. First, if x ∈ clos(K(∞)·x0), then the sequence ((Anf )(x))n∈N
is a Cauchy sequence and hence converges. Indeed, for any ε > 0, let
δ > 0 be chosen as in Lemma 2.1. We may ﬁnd y ∈ K(∞) · x0, such
that dX (y, x) ≤ δ, hence supn∈N |Anf (y) − Anf (x)| ≤ ε. It follows that

|Anf (x) − Amf (x)| ≤|Anf (x) − Anf (y)| + |Anf (y) − Amf (y)|

+ |Amf (y) − Amf (x)|

≤2ε + |Anf (y) − Amf (y)|.

Now we may use the fact derived from (2.5) that (Anf (y))n∈N is a
Cauchy sequence to conclude that so is the sequence ((Anf )(x))n∈N.
Now we have proved that the sequence of functions (Anf |clos(K(∞)·x0)),
all deﬁned on a compact set clos(K(∞) · x0), is uniformly bounded
and equicontinuous and converges pointwisely, hence by Arzel`a-Ascoli
theorem, it converges uniformly on clos(K(∞) · x0). This completes the
proof of (2.8).

Finally, in view of (2.6), we have proved that

(2.8)

lim
n→∞

(Anf )(x) = ZX

f dµ for µ-almost every x ∈ X .

Take Ψ = C(X ), the set of continuous functions on X . Since Ψ is dense
in L1(X , µ), we may apply characterization of ergodic measures (2.3)
to conclude that µ is ergodic.

3. Proof of Theorem 1.3

By Theorem 1.2, to prove Theorem 1.3, it suﬃces to show that if the
n =⇒ µ

sequence (xn)n∈N in X converges to a point x0 ∈ X such that µxn
as n → ∞, then µx0

n =⇒ µ as n → ∞.

For any ε > 0, let δ > 0 be chosen such that whenever dX (x, y) ≤ δ,
then |f (x) − f (y)| ≤ ε. There exists n0, whenever n ≥ n0, we have
dX (xn, x0) ≤ δ. Using again our assumption that the group action is an
isometric action, for any n ≥ n0, the inequality |f (g · xn) − f (g · x0)| ≤
ε holds for any g ∈ K(∞). Consequently, for any n ≥ n0, we have

|f (g · xn) − f (g · x0)| mn(dg) ≤ ε.

4. Proof of Proposition 1.5

Let K(n) = Z/2nZ. Note that we have the natural inclusion

K(n) = Z/2nZ ≃ 2Z/2n+1Z ⊂ Z/2n+1Z = K(n + 1).

The corresponding group inductive limit K(∞) is called the Pr¨ufer
2-group and is usually denoted by Z(2∞). Obviously, Z(2∞) is a count-
able group, which is inductively compact but not compact. Let X =
{0, 1}K(∞), then X is a compact metrizable space. For instance, we may
ﬁx the following metric on X : if x = (x(g))g∈K(∞) and y = (y(g))g∈K(∞),
then

∞

dX (x, y) =

Xn=1

4−n|{g ∈ K(n) : x(g) 6= y(g)}|,

where |{g ∈ K(n) : x(g) 6= y(g)}| denotes the cardinality of the ﬁnite
set {g ∈ K(n) : x(g) 6= y(g)}. The group K(∞) acts naturally on
{0, 1}K(∞) by translations. This action is not an isometric action.

Let us ﬁx the natural inclusions K(n) ⊂ K(n + 1). For any n ∈ N,

we have,

K(n + 1) = K(n) ⊔ (K(n + 1) \ K(n)).

Hence K(n+1) is the union of two K(n)-cosets in K(n+1). Now we set
xn ∈ X as follows: xn : K(∞) → {0, 1} is a function deﬁned inductively
by the following: on K(n), we set xn|K(n) = 1K(n−1); on K(n + 1), we

6

YANQI QIU

extend the deﬁnition xn such that its restriction on the nontrivial K(n)-
coset gn + K(n) with gn ∈ K(n + 1) \ K(n) is a translation of xn|K(n);
if we have deﬁned xn|K(m) for a positive integer m ≥ n, then we may
extend it to a function xn|K(m+1) such that the restriction of xn|K(m+1)
on the nontrivial K(m)-coset gm + K(m) with gm ∈ K(m + 1) \ K(m),
is given by

xn|gm+K(m)(·) = xn|K(m)(· − gm).

It is not hard to see that the orbit K(n)·xn consists of two points (both
viewed as {0, 1}-valued functions deﬁned on K(∞)):

K(n) · xn = {xn, 1 − xn}.

And we have

µxn

n =

1
2

(δxn + δ1−xn),

where δxn and δ1−xn are Dirac measures on xn and 1 − xn respectively.
By construction, we have the following convergence in the space X :

lim
n→∞

xn = ¯1 and lim

(1 − xn) = ¯0,

n→∞

where ¯0, ¯1 ∈ X = {0, 1}K(∞) are constant functions on K(∞) taking
values 0 and 1 respecively. Consequently,

µxn

n =⇒

1
2

(δ¯1 + δ¯0) as n → ∞,

Since the singletons {¯0} and {¯1} are both K(∞)-invariant, the weak
limit probability measure 1
2(δ¯1 + δ¯0) is not ergodic. This completes the
proof of Proposition 1.5.
