ABSTRACT
Recent observations have revealed the existence of an abundant population of faint,
low surface brightness (SB) galaxies, which appear to be numerous and ubiquitous in
nearby galaxy clusters, including the Virgo, Coma and Fornax clusters. With median
stellar masses of dwarf galaxies, these ultra-diﬀuse galaxies (UDGs) have unexpect-
edly large sizes, corresponding to a mean SB of 24 (cid:46) (cid:104)µe(cid:105)r mag−1arcsec2 (cid:46) 27 within
the eﬀective radius. We show that the UDG population represents the tail of galaxies
formed in dwarf-sized haloes with higher-than-average angular momentum. By adopt-
ing the standard model of disk formation – in which the size of galaxies is set by
the spin of the halo – we recover both the abundance of UDGs as a function of the
host cluster mass and the distribution of sizes within the UDG population. According
to this model, UDGs are not failed L∗ galaxies, but genuine dwarfs, and their low
SB is not uniquely connected to the harsh cluster environment. We therefore expect
a correspondingly abundant population of UDGs in the ﬁeld, with likely diﬀerent
morphologies and colours.

1 INTRODUCTION

The existence of faint and extended galaxies in both ﬁeld
and clusters is certainly not a recent discovery (e.g., Impey
et al. 1988; Bothun et al. 1991; Turner et al. 1993; Dalcanton
et al. 1997a; Caldwell 2006). However, deep and wide ﬁeld
observations of nearby galaxy clusters have only recently
ﬁrst highlighted that this population is both ubiquitous in
clusters and perhaps surprisingly numerous. Using the Drag-
onﬂy array (Abraham & van Dokkum 2014), van Dokkum
et al. (2015a) (vD15) ﬁrst identiﬁed 47 extended, roundish,
quiescent galaxies, with central surface brightness (SB) of
µg,0 = 24 − 26 mag arcsec−2, in imaging data of the Coma
cluster. Their projected spatial clustering and the inabil-
ity of Hubble ACS observations to resolve them into stars
suggested that these are actual cluster members. If so, at
a distance of approximately 100 Mpc, these galaxies would
have a median stellar mass of only ≈ 6 × 107M(cid:12), but the
sizes of L∗ galaxies, re = 1.5 − 4.6 kpc. In fact, member-
ship to Coma has been conﬁrmed for one of them with Keck
spectroscopy (van Dokkum et al. 2015b), ascertaining the
unusual properties of such ultra-diﬀuse galaxies (UDGs).

Since then, UDGs have been identiﬁed in signiﬁcant

numbers also in the Virgo cluster (Mihos et al. 2015), the
Fornax cluster (Mu˜noz et al. 2015), in 8 other clusters at red-
shift z = 0.044 − 0.063 (van der Burg et al. 2016, vdB16),
and the number of detections in Coma have increased by at
least an order of magnitude (Koda et al. 2015, K15). How-
ever, the nature of their properties has remained elusive so
far.

UDGs do not seem to show any clear evidence for tidal
stripping. Also, their colours and spatial distributions within
the host clusters imply that many of them have not just been
accreted, and that they are capable of surviving the strong
cluster tides at pericenter. vD15 soon realised that they
have to be dark matter dominated systems. In opposition
to classical low SB galaxies (e.g., van der Hulst et al. 1993;
McGaugh & Bothun 1994; Schombert et al. 2011), UDGs
appear quenched, and populate the red sequence. This has
brought vD15 and K15 to suggest that their existence could
be strictly linked with the cluster environment, and possibly
that UDGs might represent ‘failed’ L∗ galaxies, prematurely
quenched at infall by gas removal.

Measurements of the internal kinematics of UDGs
would constrain their true masses and discriminate between
diﬀerent formation pathways, however this is challenging
due to their low SB. Very recently, Beasley et al. (2016)
have taken advantage of the unusually abundant globular

cluster system of VCC 1287, a UDG in the Virgo cluster,
and, based on globular cluster spectroscopy inferred a virial
mass of only (8± 4)× 1010M(cid:12). This shows that VCC 1287 is
a genuine dwarf galaxy despite its eﬀective radius of 2.4 kpc,
disfavouring the possibility of a ‘failed’ L∗ galaxy. Interest-
ingly, similar conclusions can be drawn from the hydrody-
namical simulations of Yozin & Bekki (2015). These authors
show that larger-than-average disky dwarfs infalling onto a
cluster are quickly quenched by ram pressure stripping, and
reproduce the sizes and colours of many observed UDGs.

In this paper, we show that the properties and abun-
dance of UDGs in clusters are largely compatible with the
classical model of disk formation (e.g., Fall & Efstathiou
1980; Dalcanton et al. 1997b; Mo et al. 1998; Dutton et
al. 2007). As invoked for classical low SB galaxies (Dalcan-
ton et al. 1997a,b; Mo et al. 1998; Yozin & Bekki 2015),
galaxies formed in haloes with a higher initial spin result
in larger disks, and therefore, low SB. Here we show that
the UDG population discovered so far represents the tail of
those dwarf galaxies that formed in haloes with higher-than-
average initial angular momentum. Section 2 illustrates our
simple model and tests it against the population of normal,
high SB galaxies. Section 3 compares the prediction of our
ﬁducial model with the observed properties and abundances
of UDGs. Section 4 discusses results and draws conclusions.

2 ΛCDM GALAXY POPULATIONS

We are interested in predicting abundances of galaxies de-
ﬁned by a set of cuts in absolute magnitude, SB and/or
galaxy size, within galaxy clusters with mass M c
200. We
adopt a very simple model, in which

• The full subhalo population of the cluster is obtained
from Monte Carlo generated merger histories, with the spec-

is log-normal, with a mean value of (cid:104)ln λ(cid:105) = 0.05 and
σ(ln λ) = 0.52, independent of redshift and halo mass (e.g.,
Bullock et al. 2001; Vitvitska et al. 2002; Macci`o et al.
2007; Kim et al. 2015). The concentration of halos follows
the redshift dependent mass-concentration relation compiled
by Gao et al. (2008), with a scatter of approximately 0.3
dex (e.g., Ludlow et al. 2014). We adopt the stellar-halo
mass relation M∗(M200) proposed by Garrison-Kimmel et al.
(2014), independently of redshift, with a scatter of 0.3 dex
(Behroozi et al. 2013; Mashian et al. 2016). Also, deviations
in the properties of each galaxy from the mean relations are
assumed to be uncorrelated.

We calculate all eﬀective radii using the model of Mo
et al. (1998), with md = jd = 0.05, i.e. the speciﬁc angular
momentum of disks reﬂects that of their halos, as also sup-
ported by observations of star forming galaxies at interme-
diate redshifts (Burkert et al. 2015). We do not distinguish
galaxies according to their morphology, implicitly assum-
ing that the initial spin sets the size of stellar spheroids as
it does for disks (Shen et al. 2003; Kravtsov 2013). We use
re ≡ Rh, where Rh is the nominal disk scale-length predicted
by the model, as a function of halo mass, concentration, spin
parameter, and formation redshift zf of each galaxy. We cal-
ibrate this on average Milky Way-like halos, for which the
model predicts Rh = 3.6 kpc (as from Bovy & Rix 2013) for
zf = zmin = 0.7. Therefore, we take the formation redshift
to be the largest between zmin and the infall redshift of each
halo onto the cluster.

Our ﬁnal cluster populations only include galaxies that

survive the cluster tides according to the Roche criterion:

where M g(< 2re) is the galaxy mass within twice its eﬀec-
tive radius, and M c(< rperi) is the cluster mass within the
orbital pericenter of the galaxy. This is calculated at the
accretion redshift, using rperi = Rc

virial radius of the cluster at that time and c its concen-
tration, so that the resulting rperi is representative of the
common cosmological accretion process (e.g., Benson 2005;

Figure 3. The UDG size distribution. The shaded region shows
the size distribution of cluster UDGs, deﬁned as in vdB16, which
agrees well with the measured slope n ∝ r−3.4
, illustrated by
the black guiding line (ﬁeld UDGs are displayed with an orange

are obtained from the same observational dataset, but only
include the largest UDGs in the sample, with a more ex-
treme cut of re > 2.5 kpc. As for the full UDG population,
this tail is also quite well reproduced by our model. Finally,
Fig. 2 displays, with a green point, the measurement per-
formed by K15 for the abundance of UDGs in the Coma
cluster. They adopt the deﬁnition

 Mr < −12 mag

24.3 < (cid:104)µe(cid:105)r mag−1arcsec2 < 27.3
re > 0.8 kpc

,

(5)

which samples both fainter and less diﬀuse systems, there-
fore reaching an abundance of approximately 1000 UDGs in
the cluster. Applying these cuts to our galaxy populations
produces similar abundances, as shown by the shaded re-
gions. As the stellar M/L ratio is only weakly variable, we
uniformly adopt M/Lr = 3 M(cid:12)/L(cid:12) in the following.

vdB16 has measured the size distribution within the
UDG population, deﬁned adopting the cuts of eqn (4),
but with a more restrictive SB constraint, 24.4 <
(cid:104)µe(cid:105)r mag−1arcsec2 < 26. They ﬁnd a steep decline with
size, well ﬁt by a power-law relation n ∝ r−3.4
. Further-
more, they ﬁnd that the UDGs are approximately equally
split between two equal-size bins in SB. Figure 3 shows the
corresponding predictions from our model. We recover both
a compatible decline in the size distribution, and the ap-
proximate uniformity in SB of the UDGs deﬁned this way.
The apparent truncation in the size distribution of our clus-
ter UDG population is due to the criterion (2), which forces
all infalling UDGs on the same quite radial orbit; such trun-
cation is absent in the ﬁeld population.

where we indicate the mean SB within the eﬀective radius
with (cid:104)µe(cid:105). In the following, we refer to this population with
the term ‘bright end’, so that its abundance in any given
cluster is Nbe. The size distribution of the Virgo galaxies
is displayed in Figure 1 using a grey shaded area, and is
compared with the predictions of our simple model, that
we have used to produce 300 mock clusters, with virial

The upper panel shows the abundance of the bright end
population as a function of the cluster mass. Nbe depends
mildly on the adopted value of the mass-to-light ratio of
the population, with Nbe = 103 corresponding to a virial
200/M(cid:12)) = (14.8 ± 0.2) for galaxies with
mass of log10(M c
M/Lr = (3 ± 1)M(cid:12)/L(cid:12), in good agreement with the mass
of Virgo within the wide area covered by the Extended Virgo
Cluster Catalog (e.g., Fouqu´e et al. 2001; Cˆot´e et al. 2004).
The lower panel of Fig. 1 compares the relative distribu-
tion of galaxy sizes within the bright end population, which
matches well the measured bell-shape.

3 THE UDG POPULATION

The recent work of vdB16 is very useful to test our model, as
it presents quantitative criteria deﬁning the observed UDG
samples. We apply the same cuts to our cluster galaxy popu-
lations and compare the results. First, we address the abun-
dances N of UDGs with the following set of properties

 Mr < −13.8 mag

24 < (cid:104)µe(cid:105)r mag−1arcsec2 < 26.5
re > 1.5 kpc

,

(4)

as used by vdB16 to measure UDG abundances in 8 clus-
ters at redshift z ≈ 0.05. Black points and the black guiding
line display such measurements in Figure 2. The underly-
ing shaded regions cover the area between the 10% and the
90% quantiles as predicted by our model for the same abun-
dances, for two diﬀerent values of the mass-to-light ratio.
The quantitative agreement between model predictions and
measurements is very good. Red data points and ﬁtting line

in the plane of stellar-halo mass and in the plane of spin

tion. Contours of diﬀerent thickness include 50, 90 and 99%
of the full populations. We ﬁnd that UDGs are not failed

Figure 4. The left and right panels illustrate the location of the UDGs in the plane (M200, M∗) and in the plane of halo spin against
normalised deviation in the halo concentration. Contours represent 50, 90 and 99% of galaxies. Blue lines show the adopted abundance
matching relation in the left panel and the scatter in both spin and concentration distributions in the right panel. The smaller panels
show the one-dimensional (projected) distributions. Full and dashed lines identify the cluster and ﬁeld populations.

L∗ galaxies, but genuine dwarf galaxies, with virial masses
that, depending on the adopted observational cut, range in
the interval 1010 − 1011M(cid:12). These follow from the adopted
abundance matching relation, which however remains quite
uncertain at the low stellar masses relevant to the UDGs,
107 − 108.5M(cid:12) (e.g., Garrison-Kimmel et al. 2016). UDGs
do not seem to diverge from the mean stellar-to-halo mass
relation, at least not more than the bright end population is
oppositely biased towards systems that are more luminous
than average. Their concentrations are also average, with a
bias towards less concentrated haloes that is similar but op-
posite in sign to the bias towards higher concentrations seen
in the bright end population. Similarly, we identify only lim-
ited diﬀerences in the distribution of accretion times, with a
tendency for UDGs accreted at higher redshifts to be more
easily shredded by the cluster tides, due to the redshift de-
pendence of the halo density contrast (e.g., Amorisco 2015).
What clearly distinguishes UDGs and the bright end galax-
ies are their spin distributions. UDGs are concentrated in
the high-spin tail of the halo population, centered approx-
imately one sigma away from the mean. The bright galax-
ies are also biased, but by a much smaller amount and, of
course, in the opposite direction.

Dashed proﬁles in the one-dimensional insets show the
distribution of the diﬀerent populations when the galaxies
excised according to requirement (2) are reincorporated. Un-
der the reasonable assumption that the population of haloes
infalling onto clusters have a similar mass distribution com-
pared to those that remain isolated, these proﬁles can be
considered representative of the corresponding galaxy popu-
lations in a ﬁeld environment. Field and cluster populations
do not display signiﬁcant diﬀerences in their mean physi-
cal properties, apart from the tendency of ﬁeld populations
to shift slightly towards higher spin parameters (and there-
fore larger sizes), illustrating the fact that, according to our
model, the most diﬀuse UDGs are indeed shredded by tides
when infalling onto clusters.

4 DISCUSSION

We have shown that the unexpectedly large size and low
SB of UDGs are reproduced naturally within the same stan-
dard framework that describes the properties of normal high
SB galaxies. The combination of a ΛCDM population of
haloes and a classical abundance matching relation is suﬃ-
cient to reproduce the signiﬁcant numbers of UDGs observed
in galaxy clusters, as a result of the extremely abundant
population of dwarf galaxies and the sharp decline in the
M∗(M200) relation at low masses. UDGs are not a diﬀer-
ent or peculiar new population of galaxies, but rather the
natural extension of normal dwarfs into the low SB regime,
characterised by high-spin haloes.

According to our simple criterion for survival against
the tides, several UDGs are indeed not compact enough,
conﬁrming that a cluster environment is a harsh one for
these tenuous dwarfs and suggesting that a fraction of the
observed UDGs may in fact be on the verge of tidal dis-
ruption. Indeed, as noticed by K15, the morphological prop-
erties of the observed UDGs are incompatible with them
being a population of disks, and their transformation from
very extended disks to thin spheroids may well be caused by
the interaction with the cluster, through ram pressure strip-
ping and tidal stirring (e.g., Mayer et al. 2001; Kazantzidis
et al. 2011).

However, the cluster itself is not strictly necessary for
the formation of dwarf galaxies with such a low SB. Under
the assumption that the spin distribution is not strongly
dependent on environment (e.g., Macci`o et al. 2007; Kim
et al. 2015) and that these extended disks are capable
of forming stars in a similar way when in isolation, our
model suggests that an abundant tail of extended galax-
ies should be ubiquitous in both clusters and in the ﬁeld.
In fact, Martinez-Delgado et al. (2016) have recently dis-
covered a UDG, DGSAT I, in the outskirts of the Pisces-
Perseus supercluster, in a considerably less dense environ-

Figure 5. The number density of galaxies in the plane
(Mr, (cid:104)µe(cid:105)r), relative to the number in the bright cluster pop-
ulation, Nbe. Colour-coding is as in Fig. 4, with blue contours
representing the full galaxy population. The contour sets iden-
tify the density values {10−2.2, 10−1.2, 10−0.6}. Orange contours
show the quantity log10 [N (Mr, (cid:104)µe(cid:105)r)/Nbe], where N (Mr, (cid:104)µe(cid:105)r)
is the total number of galaxies brighter than Mr and with SB
higher than (cid:104)µe(cid:105)r. Full and dashed proﬁles (in both blue and
orange) refer respectively to the cluster and ﬁeld populations.

ment than the other known UDGs. DGSAT I displays an
out-of-center, bluer over-density, compatible with a clump
of recently formed stars, and suggesting that the isolated
counterparts of cluster UDGs may have more clearly disky
morphologies, and not appear as red and quenched. After
this manuscript was submitted Roman & Trujillo (2016) re-
ported the detection of a numerous population of UDGs in
the large scale structure surrounding the cluster Abel 168,
conﬁrming that UDGs can indeed form outside clusters. In
support of our model, the same authors also ﬁnd that the
spatial distribution of UDGs is almost identical to that of
normal dwarf galaxies, while it is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
the one of L∗ galaxies.

Finally, to facilitate comparisons with future observa-
tions, Figure 5 provides predictions for the abundance of
galaxy populations as a function of the deﬁning cuts, rela-
tive to the cluster population in the bright end, Nbe. Orange
lines display contours of the quantity

log10 n(Mr ,(cid:104)µe(cid:105)r ) = log N(Mr ,(cid:104)µe(cid:105)r ) − log N(−13.4,24.5)

where N(Mr ,(cid:104)µe(cid:105)r ) is the number of galaxies brighter than
Mr and with SB higher than (cid:104)µe(cid:105)r, so that N(−13.4,24.5) =
Nbe. Full and dashed lines refer to the cluster and, even more
numerous, ﬁeld populations.

Our simple model does not directly address the detailed
evolutionary pathways of UDGs, how such thin galaxies can
indeed form stars, or whether they are made even more dark
matter dominated when in a cluster environment with re-
spect to the ﬁeld. Follow up spectroscopic studies and per-
haps the observation of ﬁeld UDGs will allow better con-
straints on these issues.
