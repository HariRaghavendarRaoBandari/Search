ON SELF-SIMILAR FINITE p-GROUPS

AZAM BABAI, KHADIJEH FATHALIKHANI,

GUSTAVO A. FERN ´ANDEZ-ALCOBER, AND MATTEO VANNACCI

Abstract. In this paper, we address the following question: when is a
ﬁnite p-group G self-similar, i.e. when can G be faithfully represented as
a self-similar group of automorphisms of the p-adic tree? We show that,
if G is a self-similar ﬁnite p-group of rank r, then its order is bounded
by a function of p and r. This applies in particular to ﬁnite p-groups of
a given coclass. In the particular case of groups of maximal class, that
is, of coclass 1, we can fully answer the question above: a p-group of
maximal class G is self-similar if and only if it contains an elementary
abelian maximal subgroup over which G splits. Furthermore, in that
case the order of G is at most p p+1, and this bound is sharp.

1. Introduction

A lot of interest has been raised in the past decades around groups of au-
tomorphisms of rooted trees, since they provide many examples and coun-
terexamples for signiﬁcant problems in group theory. Prominent among
these examples are the groups constructed by Grigorchuk [6], and by Gupta
and Sidki [7], which act on the p-adic tree, i.e. a regular rooted tree with
p children at each vertex, where p is a prime number. One of the most
important properties of the Grigorchuk and Gupta-Sidki groups is the fact
that they are self-similar . In other words, for every automorphism g in such
a group G, and for every vertex u of the tree, the section gu also belongs to
G. (See the beginning of Section 2 for the deﬁnition of sections and other
relevant concepts from the theory of groups of automorphisms of rooted
trees.)

Given an abstract group G and a prime p, the question arises as to whether
or not G can be faithfully represented as a self-similar group of automor-
phisms of the p-adic tree. If the answer is positive, then we say that G is
self-similar for the prime p. Nekrashevych and Sidki [14] showed that free
abelian groups of ﬁnite rank are self-similar for the prime 2, a result which
can similarly be established for all primes [13, Section 2.9.2]. On the con-
trary, if a ﬁnitely generated nilpotent group G is self-similar for the prime p
and the corresponding action is transitive on the ﬁrst level of the tree, then
G is either free abelian or a ﬁnite p-group, as proved by Berlatto and Sidki

in [1, Corollary 2]. Further results about self-similar general abelian groups
can be found in [2]; for example, abelian torsion groups of inﬁnite exponent
are not self-similar with level-transitive action.

Not much is known about self-similarity of ﬁnite p-groups. We can men-
tion the work of ˇSuni´c [16], who proved that a ﬁnite p-group is isomorphic
to a self-similar group of automorphisms of the p-adic tree with abelian ﬁrst
level stabilizer (so in particular with an abelian maximal subgroup) if and
only if it is a split extension of an elementary abelian group by a cyclic
group of order p. Actually, as we show in Theorem 2.2, this characterization
extends to all ﬁnite p-groups with an abelian maximal subgroup, without
needing to specify any properties of its action on the tree. On the other
hand, since a direct power of a self-similar group is again self-similar [13,
Proposition 2.9.3], there are self-similar p-groups without abelian maximal
subgroups.

In this paper we show that self-similarity is a strong condition to impose
on a ﬁnite p-group. More speciﬁcally, in our ﬁrst main theorem we prove
that, for every prime p, there are only ﬁnitely many self-similar p-groups
of a given rank. This should be compared with the fact that every ﬁnite
p-group can be faithfully represented as a group of automorphisms of the
p-adic tree, by using its action on the coset tree corresponding to a chief
series.

Theorem A. Let G be a ﬁnite self-similar p-group of rank r. Then the
order of G is bounded by a function of p and r.

As a consequence, the order of a self-similar p-group can be bounded in
terms of the prime p and its coclass. We can give more detailed information
in the case of ﬁnite p-groups of coclass 1, i.e. groups of maximal class. As a
matter of fact, in our second main theorem we fully characterize self-similar
p-groups of maximal class. Furthermore we obtain the best possible bound
for the order of such a group.

Theorem B. Let G be a ﬁnite p-group of maximal class. Then G is self-
similar if and only if G possesses an elementary abelian maximal subgroup
over which G splits. If that is the case, then the order of G is at most pp+1,
and this bound is sharp.

Thus for groups of maximal class we get the same characterization ob-
tained by ˇSuni´c, even if most groups of maximal class do not have abelian
maximal subgroups. Observe that Theorem B gives plenty of examples of
ﬁnite p-groups which are not self-similar; in this respect, see Sections 3.1
and 8.2 of the book [11] by Leedham-Green and McKay.

If G is a ﬁnitely generated group, we use d(G) to denote the

minimum number of generators of G. On the other hand, if G is a ﬁnite
p-group and i ≥ 0 is an integer, Ωi(G) is the subgroup generated by all
elements of G of order at most pi, and Gpi
is the subgroup generated by all
pith powers of elements of G.

2. Preliminaries

We brieﬂy recall some concepts about the theory of groups of automor-
phisms of regular rooted trees. Let X be a set of cardinality k. The k-adic
tree T is the graph whose vertices are the elements of the free monoid X ∗
generated by X, and v is a descendant of u if and only if v = ux for some
x ∈ X. The words in X ∗ of length n form the nth level of T . An automor-
phism g of T is a bijective map from X ∗ to itself that preserves incidence.
The section of g at a vertex u, which we denote by gu, is the automorphism
of T which is deﬁned by the rule

g(uv) = g(u)gu(v),

for every v ∈ X ∗.

The automorphisms of T form a group Aut T under composition. A sub-
group G of Aut T is self-similar if gu ∈ G for every u ∈ X ∗.

A virtual endomorphism of a group G is a homomorphism φ : H → G,
where H is a subgroup of G of ﬁnite index. If |G : H| = k then φ is said to be
a virtual 1
k -endomorphism. Also, we say that φ is simple if the only subgroup
of H which is normal in G and φ-invariant (in the sense that φ(H) ⊆ H)
is the trivial subgroup. Every self-similar group G of automorphisms of the
k-adic tree T acting transitively on the ﬁrst level deﬁnes a simple virtual
1
k -endomorphism, by taking H = StabG(x), where x ∈ X, and deﬁning
φ : H → G by φ(h) = hx. The converse is also true: every simple virtual
1
k -endomorphism φ : H → G can be used to deﬁne a faithful action of G on
T that identiﬁes G with a self-similar group acting transitively on the ﬁrst
level, and in which H is the stabilizer of a letter of X. This is accomplished
by using a coset tree; see [12] and [13] for further details.

We are interested in the following question:

if p is a prime, when can
a ﬁnite p-group G be faithfully represented as a self-similar group of auto-
morphisms of the p-adic tree? One can easily see that a non-trivial ﬁnite
p-group with a self-similar action on the p-adic tree is transitive on the
ﬁrst level. Thus, according to the previous paragraph, the question reduces
to this: given a ﬁnite p-group G, when does there exist a simple virtual
endomorphism φ : H → G for some maximal subgroup H of G?

As mentioned in the introduction, ˇSuni´c gave an answer to this question
when H is abelian, which corresponds to the action of G having an abelian
ﬁrst-level stabilizer. In that case, there exists a simple virtual endomorphism
φ : H → G if and only if H is elementary abelian and G splits over H. Next
we want to show that ˇSuni´c’s result applies to all ﬁnite p-groups with an
abelian maximal subgroup, without any requirements about the action of
the group on the tree. We need the following lemma (see [9, Lemma 4.6 and
its proof]).

Lemma 2.1. Let G be a ﬁnite p-group with an abelian maximal subgroup
A. Then the following hold:

(i) For every g ∈ G r A, we have G′ = {[g, a] | a ∈ A}. Thus |G′| =

|A : CA(g)|.

(ii) If G is not abelian, then |G : Z(G)| = p|G′|.

4 A. BABAI, KH. FATHALIKHANI, G.A. FERN ´ANDEZ-ALCOBER, AND M. VANNACCI

Theorem 2.2. Let G be a ﬁnite p-group with an abelian maximal subgroup.
Then G is self-similar if and only if G possesses an elementary abelian
maximal subgroup over which G splits.

Proof. By ˇSuni´c’s result, we only have to prove the ‘only if’ part. Assume
then that G is self-similar, and consider a simple virtual endomorphism
φ : H → G, where H is maximal in G. Again by ˇSuni´c’s theorem, it suﬃces
to prove that H is abelian. By way of contradiction, suppose that H is
not abelian. Let A be an abelian maximal subgroup of G, which exists by
hypothesis.

We ﬁrst prove that φ is injective. If there exists x ∈ ker φ r A then, since
A ∩ H is an abelian maximal subgroup of H, we have H ′ = [x, A ∩ H] by
Lemma 2.1. Thus φ(H ′) = 1 and, since φ is simple, we have H ′ = 1. This
is contrary to our assumption. Thus ker φ ⊆ A and A normalizes ker φ. It
follows that ker φ E G, and consequently ker φ = 1, as desired.

Let g ∈ H r A, and observe that G′ = [g, G] by Lemma 2.1. If there exists
a ∈ CA(g) r H then G = haiH and G′ = [g, H]. Hence G′ = H ′. Since
φ(H ′) ⊆ G′, it follows that G′ = 1, which is a contradiction. Consequently
CA(g) ⊆ H, in other words, Z(G) ⊆ Z(H). Then, again by Lemma 2.1,

|G′| = |A : CA(g)| = p|A ∩ H : CA(g)| = p|A ∩ H : CA∩H(g)| = p|H ′|.

Since also |G : Z(G)| = p|G′| and |H : Z(H)| = p|H ′|, it follows that
Z(G) = Z(H). Now if we put K = φ(H) then φ−1 deﬁnes a simple virtual
1
p -endomorphism from K to G. Thus we also have Z(G) = Z(K). Then

φ(Z(G)) = φ(Z(H)) = Z(K) = Z(G),

which is impossible, since φ is simple. This ﬁnal contradiction shows that
H must be abelian.
(cid:3)

The last theorem naturally raises the following question: if G is a ﬁnite
p-group with an abelian maximal subgroup A, is it true that G is self-similar
if and only if A itself is elementary abelian and G splits over A? This is
equivalent to asking whether all abelian maximal subgroups of a self-similar
p-group are elementary abelian. As we next see, this question has a positive
answer for odd primes, but not for the prime 2.

Corollary 2.3. Let G be a ﬁnite p-group, where p is an odd prime. If G
has an abelian maximal subgroup A, then G is self-similar if and only if A
is elementary abelian and G splits over A.

Proof. By Theorem 2.2, there exists an elementary abelian maximal sub-
group H over which G splits. Then A ∩ H ⊆ Z(G) and G has class at
most 2. Let hgi be a complement to H in G, and write g = ah with a ∈ A
and h ∈ H. Then a = gh−1 is of order p, since G is a regular p-group.
Consequently A = ha, A ∩ Hi is elementary abelian.
(cid:3)

On the other hand, note that the dihedral group D8 is self-similar and

possesses a non-elementary abelian maximal subgroup.

3. Finite p-groups of a given rank

In this section we prove Theorem A, which shows that there are only
ﬁnitely many self-similar ﬁnite p-groups of a given rank. Recall that the
(Pr¨ufer) rank of a ﬁnite group is the maximum of the values of d(H) as H
ranges over all subgroups of G. The proof of Theorem A relies on the theory
of powerful p-groups. A ﬁnite p-group G is called powerful if G′ ≤ Gp for
p > 2, or G′ ≤ G4 for p = 2. The main results about powerful p-groups can
be found in the books [3] and [10].

Given a ﬁnite group G, a tuple (a1, . . . , ad) is said to be a basis of G
if every g ∈ G can be uniquely written in the form g = an1
d with
0 ≤ ni < |ai| for i = 1, . . . , d. By [3, Chapter 2, Exercise 9], every powerful
p-group has bases. On the other hand, if G = hx1, . . . , xri is a powerful
p-group then G = hx1i . . . hxri (see [3, Corollary 2.8]). As a consequence, all
bases of G have d(G) elements, and the order of the elements in a basis of
G is irrelevant. In the remainder, when we consider a basis (a1, . . . , ad) of a
powerful p-group, we will always assume that |a1| ≥ · · · ≥ |ad|.

1 . . . and

As we next see, a basis of a powerful p-group G can be used to obtain the

subgroup Ω1(G) if p is odd, and the same result is true for G2 if p = 2.
Lemma 3.1. Let G be a powerful p-group, and let N = G2. If {a1, . . . , ad}
is a basis of N , and |ai| = mi for every i = 1, . . . , d, then

Ω1(N ) = hami/p

i

| i = 1, . . . , di.

Proof. Since N is powerful and d = d(N ), we have |N : N p| = |N : Φ(N )| =
pd. It follows that |Ω1(N )| = pd, by [5, Theorem 1]. On the other hand,
since {a1, . . . , ad} is a basis of N , the subgroup

hami/p

i

| i = 1, . . . , di

of Ω1(N ) has cardinality at least pd. This completes the proof.

(cid:3)

Of course, G2 coincides with G if p is odd, and stating the last lemma for
G2 is only a trick to avoid a case distinction according as p is odd or p = 2.

We can now prove Theorem A. We use the expression ‘(p, r)-bounded’ as

shorthand for ‘bounded above by a function of p and r’.

Theorem 3.2. Let G be a self-similar ﬁnite p-group of rank r. Then the
order of G is (p, r)-bounded.

Proof. Let φ : H → G be a simple virtual endomorphism from a maximal
subgroup H of G. By Proposition 2.12 and Theorem 2.13 of [3], there exists a
normal subgroup P of G of (p, r)-bounded index with the property that every
subgroup of P which is normal in G is powerful. If we put N = (P ∩ H)2,
then N has also (p, r)-bounded index in G, and it suﬃces to show that N
has (p, r)-bounded order.

Let us consider a basis (a1, . . . , ad) of the powerful group N , and observe
that d = d(N ) ≤ r. Set |ai| = mi for i = 1, . . . , d, and md+1 = 1. If e denotes
the exponent of G/N , we claim that mi ≤ emi+1 for every i = 1, . . . , d. By
way of contradiction, assume that mj > emj+1 for some j, and for simplicity,
put m = mj+1. Now, we have
(1)

φ(Ω1(N em)) ⊆ Ω1(Gem) ⊆ Ω1(N m),

6 A. BABAI, KH. FATHALIKHANI, G.A. FERN ´ANDEZ-ALCOBER, AND M. VANNACCI

N m = ham

i = Ω1(N em).

Thus, by (1), we get φ(Ω1(N em)) ⊆ Ω1(N em). Since φ is simple, this implies
that Ω1(N em) = 1. This contradiction proves the claim.
It follows that
mi ≤ ed−i+1 for all i = 1, . . . , d, and consequently

|N | = m1 . . . md ≤ ed(d+1)/2.

Since d ≤ r and e is (p, r)-bounded, we conclude that the order of N is
(p, r)-bounded, as desired.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.3. Let G be a self-similar ﬁnite p-group of coclass s. Then the
order of G is (p, s)-bounded.

Proof. According to [15, Theorems 1.2 and 1.5], G contains a powerful char-
acteristic subgroup N with (p, s)-bounded index and at most ps+1 genera-
tors. Thus rk(N ) ≤ ps+1, by [3, Theorem 2.9]. Consequently G has (p, s)-
bounded rank, and the result follows from Theorem 3.2.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.4. Let G be a self-similar ﬁnite d-generator p-group of class
c. Then the order of G is (p, d, c)-bounded.

Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 3.2, since the rank of a d-
generator nilpotent group of class c is (d, c)-bounded.
(cid:3)

Of course, the number d of generators is necessary in the bound of the

previous corollary, since elementary abelian p-groups are all self-similar.

The following result, whose proof is contained in the proof of Theorem

3.2, may be of independent interest.

Proposition 3.5. Let G be a self-similar ﬁnite p-group, and let φ : H → G
be a simple virtual endomorphism, with H maximal in G. If U ⊆ H is a
uniform normal subgroup of G then exp(U ) ≤ exp(G/U ) if p is odd, and
exp(U ) ≤ 4 exp(G/U ) if p = 2.

Proof. Put N = U 2, and use the same notation as in the proof of Theorem
3.2. Since N is uniform, we have exp(N ) = md, and on the other hand,
md ≤ exp(G/N ) by the proof of Theorem 3.2. Thus exp(N ) ≤ exp(G/N ),
and the result follows.
(cid:3)

4. p-groups of maximal class

In this ﬁnal section, we deal with ﬁnite p-groups of coclass 1, also known
as p-groups of maximal class. We prove Theorem B, which gives a full
characterization of self-similar p-groups of maximal class and determines the
best bound for the order of a self-similar p-group of maximal class. Observe
that, by Theorem 2.2, we need only consider p-groups of maximal class of
order at least p4.

ON SELF-SIMILAR FINITE p-GROUPS

7

Before proceeding, we need to introduce some concepts and results from
the theory of groups of maximal class, for which we refer the reader to [4]
and [8, Chapter III, Section 14]. A p-group G of order pn with n ≥ 2 is said
to be of maximal class if its nilpotency class is n − 1. If we put Gi = γi(G)
for every i ≥ 2, this means that |G : G2| = p2 and |Gi : Gi+1| = p for every
i = 2, . . . , n − 1. The upper central series of a p-group of maximal class
coincides with its lower central series; in particular, Z(G) is of order p for
n ≥ 3. Actually, it is easy to describe all normal subgroups of G: we only
have to add the p + 1 maximal subgroups to the terms of the lower central
series of G.

For a group of maximal class G of order pn ≥ p4, we put G1 = CG(G2/G4),
so that |G : G1| = |G1 : G2| = p. Then the largest integer ℓ ∈ {0, . . . , n − 3}
such that [Gi, Gj ] ≤ Gi+j+ℓ for all i, j ≥ 1 is called the degree of commu-
tativity of G, and we write ℓ = ℓ(G). A fundamental fact in the theory
of p-groups of maximal class is that ℓ(G/Z(G)) ≥ 1 for all n ≥ 5. As a
consequence, all the so-called two-step centralizers CG(Gi/Gi+2) (which are
maximal subgrups of G) coincide with G1 for i = 2, . . . , n − 3, and the re-
maining two-step centralizer, i.e. CG(Gn−2), is equal to G1 if and only if
ℓ(G) ≥ 1. Another key result that we will need is that a ﬁnite p-group is
of maximal class if and only if it contains an element s whose centralizer is
of order p2. The elements satisfying this property are exactly the elements
in the diﬀerence G r (G1 ∪ CG(Gn−2)), and they are called uniform ele-
ments of G. If s is a uniform element, then the order of s is p or p2, and
sp ∈ Z(G). Also, for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2, if x ∈ Gi r Gi+1 then we have
[x, s] ∈ Gi+1 r Gi+2.

Our analysis of the representation of a p-group of maximal class G as a
self-similar group of automorphisms of the p-adic tree requires a thorough
understanding of the subgroups of G which contain a uniform element. Cer-
tainly, these groups are of maximal class again, but much more can be said.
We need the following straightforward lemma.

Lemma 4.1. Let G be a p-group of maximal class of order pn ≥ p4, and let
K be a subgroup of G which contains a uniform element. If there exists an
element x of K lying in the diﬀerence Gt \ Gt+1, then Gt ≤ K.

Proof. If s ∈ K is a uniform element of G, then [x, s] ∈ Gt+1 \Gt+2, [x, s, s] ∈
Gt+2 \ Gt+3, and so on until we get an element in Gn−1 r Gn. Since all these
elements lie in K, we conclude that Gt ≤ K.
(cid:3)

Proposition 4.2. Let G be a p-group of maximal class of order pn ≥ p4,
and let K be a subgroup of G which contains a uniform element s. If the
order of K is pn−t, then K = hs, Gt+1i.

Proof. Since G = hsiG1 and s ∈ K, we have K = hsi(K ∩G1), by Dedekind’s
law. Hence K ∩ G1 is of order pn−t−1. The result is obvious for t = n − 1,
so we assume that t ≤ n − 2. Then K ∩ G1 6= 1, and so we can consider

j = min{i | 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, K ∩ (Gi r Gi+1) 6= ∅}.

Now it is clear from Lemma 4.1 that K ∩ G1 = Gj. Since |Gj| = pn−j, we
conclude that j = t + 1. Thus K = hs, Gt+1i, as desired.
(cid:3)

8 A. BABAI, KH. FATHALIKHANI, G.A. FERN ´ANDEZ-ALCOBER, AND M. VANNACCI

Proposition 4.3. Let G be a p-group of maximal class of order at least p4,
and let H be a maximal subgroup of G diﬀerent from G1. Then, there is no
simple virtual endomorphism from H to G.

Proof. First of all, we observe that H ′ = [H, G2], since H/G2 is cyclic. The
commutator [H, G2] is a normal subgroup of G which is strictly contained in
G2, so it must coincide with Gi for some i ≥ 3. Now [H, G2] is not contained
in G4, since otherwise H = G1. Hence [H, G2] = G3.

By way of contradiction, let us assume that φ : H → G is a simple virtual
endomorphism. Then φ(H) is a proper subgroup of G, and we can consider
a maximal subgroup M of G containing φ(H). Now we have

φ(H ′) = φ(H)′ ≤ M ′ = [M, G2] ≤ G3 = H ′,

which is impossible, since φ is simple and H ′ 6= 1.

(cid:3)

At this moment, we can prove the second part of Theorem B, namely the
bound for the order of a self-similar p-group of maximal class. This bound is
sharp, since the wreath product Cp ≀ Cp is a self-similar p-group of maximal
class of order pp+1.

Corollary 4.4. Let G be a p-group of maximal class. If G is self-similar
then |G| ≤ pp+1.
Proof. Assume that |G| > pp+1. By Theorem 4.9 of [4], we have Gp
Since sp ∈ Z(G) for every s ∈ G r G1, it follows that Gp = Gp

Proposition 4.3. Then φ(Gp) = φ(Gp

1 = Gp.
1 6= 1. Now let
p -endomorphism of G, and observe that H = G1 by
1) ⊆ Gp, which is a contradiction, since
(cid:3)

The following result completes the proof of Theorem B.

Theorem 4.5. Let G be a p-group of maximal class of order at least p4.
Then G is self-similar if and only if G1 is elementary abelian, and G is a
split extension over G1.
Proof. By ˇSuni´c’s result, we only need to prove the ‘only if’ part of the
statement of the theorem. So assume that G is self-similar, and let φ : H →
G be a simple virtual endomorphism, where H is a maximal subgroup of G.
By Proposition 4.3, H must be G1.

Let G be of order pn, and suppose ﬁrst that ℓ(G) ≥ 1. Since φ is simple,
it follows that φ(G1) * G1. If s ∈ φ(G1) r G1, then s is a uniform element
of G, since CG(Gn−2) = G1 in this case. Consequently, by Proposition 4.2,
we have φ(G1) = hs, Gt+1i, for some integer t. If |φ(G1)| ≥ p3, then the
centre of φ(G1) is of order p, since this group is also of maximal class. As a
consequence, we get Z(φ(G1)) = Z(G). On the other hand, since Z(G1) is
a normal subgroup of G, it follows that Z(G) ≤ Z(G1). Consequently,

φ(Z(G1)) ≤ Z(φ(G1)) = Z(G) ≤ Z(G1),

which is a contradiction, since φ is simple. Thus |φ(G1)| = p or p2, and then
1) = φ(G1)′ = 1. Since φ is simple, this implies that G1 is abelian. By
φ(G′
ˇSuni´c’s result, we know that G1 is elementary abelian and G splits over G1,
as desired.

Assume now that ℓ(G) = 0. Since Z(G1) is normal in G, we must have
Z(G1) = Gi for some i. But we have [G1, Gn−2] 6= 1, since G1 6= CG(Gn−2)
in this case. Thus Z(G1) = Gn−1 is of order p. If φ is not injective, then
Z(G1) ≤ ker φ. Therefore, φ(Z(G1)) = 1, which is a contradiction, since
φ is simple. On the other hand, if φ is injective, then φ(G1) is a maximal
1| ≥ p3, and
subgroup of G. Since G′
G1 is not of maximal class. So neither φ(G1) is of maximal class. But
we know that all maximal subgroups of G other than G1 and CG(Gn−2)
are of maximal class, and also φ(G1) 6= G1, since φ is simple. Thus we
necessarily have φ(G1) = CG(Gn−2). This implies that G1 and CG(Gn−2)
are isomorphic, but notice that |Z(G1)| = p, while Z(CG(Gn−2)) contains
Gn−2, which is of order p2. This contradiction shows that we cannot have
ℓ(G) = 0, which completes the proof of the theorem.

1 = [G1, G2] ≤ G4, we have |G1 : G′

If G is a p-group of maximal class with G1 elementary abelian, one can-
not guarantee that G is a self-similar p-group.
Indeed, it may perfectly
happen that all elements in G r G1 (i.e. all uniform elements) are of order
p2. However, we have the following result.

Corollary 4.6. Let G be a p-group of maximal class of order at most pp+1
in which G1 is abelian. Then G/Z(G) is a self-similar p-group.

Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Theorem 4.5, since by Theorem
4.7 of [4] the quotient group G/Z(G) is of exponent p.
