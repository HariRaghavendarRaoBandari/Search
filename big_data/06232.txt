Remarks on Tsfasman-Boguslavsky Conjecture and

Higher Weights of Projective Reed-Muller Codes

Mrinmoy Datta and Sudhir R. Ghorpade

Abstract. Tsfasman-Boguslavsky Conjecture predicts the maximum number
of zeros that a system of linearly independent homogeneous polynomials of the
same positive degree with coeﬃcients in a ﬁnite ﬁeld can have in the corre-
sponding projective space. We give a self-contained proof to show that this
conjecture holds in the aﬃrmative in the case of systems of three homogeneous
polynomials, and also to show that the conjecture is false in the case of ﬁve
quadrics in the 3-dimensional projective space over a ﬁnite ﬁeld. Connections
between the Tsfasman-Boguslavsky Conjecture and the determination of gen-
eralized Hamming weights of projective Reed-Muller codes are outlined and
these are also exploited to show that this conjecture holds in the aﬃrmative
in the case of systems of a “large” number of three homogeneous polynomials,
and to deduce the counterexample of 5 quadrics.

1. Introduction

Fix positive integers m, d, r and a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq with q elements. Denote by S
the ring Fq[x0, x1, . . . , xm] of polynomials in m + 1 variables with coeﬃcients in Fq.
For any integer k, let

(1)

pk :=(qk + qk−1 + · · · + q + 1

0

if k ≥ 0,
if k < 0.

Evidently, if k ≥ 0, then pk is the number of points in Pk(Fq), the k-dimensional
projective space over Fq. Here is a remarkable conjecture mentioned in the title.

Tsfasman-Boguslavsky Conjecture (TBC): Assume that r ≤(cid:0)m+d

d < q − 1. Then the maximum number of common zeros in Pm(Fq) that a system
of r linearly independent homogeneous polynomials of degree d in S can have is

d (cid:1) and

(2)

Tr(d, m) := pm−2j +

νi(pm−i − pm−i−j),

mXi=j

where (ν1, . . . , νm+1) is the rth element in descending lexicographic order among
(m+1)-tuples (α1, . . . , αm+1) of nonnegative integers satisfying α1+· · ·+αm+1 = d,
and where j := min{i : νi 6= 0}.

The TBC, i.e., the above conjecture, has been shown to hold in the aﬃrmative
when r = 1 by Serre [14] and independently, by Sørensen [15] in 1991 and when
r = 2 by Boguslavsky [2] in 1997. Recently, in [5] and [4] we proved the following.

1. TBC holds in the aﬃrmative when r ≤ m + 1.

2. TBC is false, in general, when r > m + 1 and d > 1. More precisely, (2)

is false for d = 2 and at least(cid:0)m−1

2 (cid:1) values of r with m + 1 < r ≤(cid:0)m+2
2 (cid:1).

Our proofs of 1 and 2 use, respectively, the following nontrivial theorems.

Heijnen-Pellikaan Theorem: Assume that d < q and r ≤ m + 1. Then
the maximum number of zeros in Am(Fq) that a system of r linearly
independent polynomials in Fq[x1, . . . , xm] of degree at most d can have is

(d − 1)qm−1 + ⌊qm−r⌋.

Zanella’s Theorem: For any integer j ≥ −1, write δj := 1+2+· · ·+(j +1).

Assume that r ≤ δm and let k be the unique integer such that

−1 ≤ k < m and δm − δk+1 < r ≤ δm − δk.

If er(2, m) denotes the maximum number of zeros in Pm(Fq) for a system
of r linearly independent homogeneous polynomials in S of degree 2, then

er(2, m) ≤ pk + ⌊qǫ−1⌋,

where

ǫ := δm − δk − r.

What is stated above are, in fact, special cases of the results of Heijnen and Pellikaan

[9], which deals, more generally, with the case r ≤(cid:0)m+d

gives an exact value for er(2, m). But even in these special cases, the results are
nontrivial, and it would be interesting to have proofs of 1 and 2 that are independent
of these nontrivial results. It is hoped that such proofs could pave the way toward
a more general conjecture stated in [5, Conjecture 6.6] that ameliorates the TBC.
With this in view, we give in this paper fairly self-contained proofs to show that:

d (cid:1), and of Zanella [18], which

1. TBC holds in the aﬃrmative when r = 3 or(cid:0)m+d

d (cid:1) − j for j = 0, 1, . . . , d.

2. TBC is false when m = 3, d = 2 and r = 5, i.e., for 5 quadrics in P3.

The theorem of Heijnen-Pellikaan is intimately related to the determination of
higher weights (also known as, generalized Hamming weights) of Reed-Muller codes
and in fact, that was the original motivation of [9]. In a similar manner, the TBC is
closely related to determination of higher weights of projective Reed-Muller codes.
Indeed, if we let er(d, m) denote the maximum number of zeros in Pm(Fq) for a
system of r linearly independent homogeneous polynomials in S of degree d, then

(3)

dr (PRMq(d, m)) = pm − er(d, m)

where PRMq(d, m) denotes the q-ary projective Reed-Muller code of order d and
length pm. In turn, coding theoretic results about PRMq(d, m), such as the mini-
mum distance of its dual, can be used to derive useful results concerning the TBC.
This is the approach we take for constructing the smallest counterexample to TBC
(of 5 quadrics in P3) as an alternative to using Zanella’s theorem, and also for
showing that the TBC holds in the aﬃrmative for the last d + 1 values of r. As for
proving that the TBC holds in the aﬃrmative when r = 3, we tweak the arguments
in [5] to arrive at a proof that does not use the Heijnen-Pellikaan Theorem. In a

TSFASMAN-BOGUSLAVSKY CONJECTURE AND PROJECTIVE REED-MULLER CODES 3

section on preliminaries, we include a new and short proof of a basic bound due to
Lachaud for the number of points of an equidimensional projective algebraic set of
a given degree. This result was used in [5] and will also be used here.

2. Preliminaries

We shall continue to use the notations and terminology introduced in the pre-
vious section. In particular, r, m, d are ﬁxed positive integers and pk is as in (1).
Denote by Fq a ﬁxed algebraic closure of Fq. For any ﬁeld F and any nonnegative
integer j, we will denote by Pj(F) the j-dimensional projective space over F, and by

bPj(F) the dual of Pj(F), consisting of all hyperplanes in Pj(F). We are mostly inter-
ested in the case F = Fq and we often write Pj(Fq) andbPj(Fq) simply as Pj andbPj,

respectively. For any set F of homogeneous polynomials in S := Fq[x0, x1. . . . , xm],
we denote by V(F ) the set of common zeros in Pm(Fq) of the polynomials in F .
Likewise, for any P ⊆ Fq[x1. . . . , xm], we denote by Z(P) the set of common zeros
in Am(Fq) of polynomials in P. Sets such as V(F ) and Z(P) are often referred
to as projective varities and aﬃne varieties, respectively. Thus we use the word
variety to mean a Zariski closed subset in Pm (or in Am) that need not be irre-
ducible. We call such varieties to be irreducible if the corresponding varieties over
are irreducible. Likewise for any (aﬃne or projective) variety X, by the dimension
of X, denoted dim X, we mean the dimension of the corresponding variety X of X
and for any projective variety X ⊆ Pm(Fq), by the degree of X, denoted deg X, we
mean the degree of X ⊆ Pm(Fq). Recall that if F is an algebraically closed ﬁeld, Y
a projective variety in Pm(F) and Y1, . . . , Yk the irreducible components of Y , then

dim Y = max{dim Yi : i = 1, . . . , k} and

deg Y = X1≤i≤k

dim Yi=dim Y

deg Yi.

In particular, if Y is equidimensional, i.e., if all its irreducible components have the
same dimension, then deg Y is the sum of degrees of its irreducible components.

The following simple, but useful, lemma appears to be classical. We learned it
from Zanella [18]. The short proof given below was suggested by M. Homma and
is sketched in [4, Remark 2.3]. For alternative proofs, one may refer to [4].

Lemma 2.1. Let X ⊆ Pm and a := max{|X ∩Π| : Π ∈bPm}. Then |X| ≤ aq +1.
Proof. Consider the incidence set I := {(P, Π) ∈ X ×bPm : P ∈ Π}. Clearly,
|I | = XP ∈X

and |I | = XΠ∈bPm

|{Π ∈bPm : P ∈ Π}| = |X|pm−1

Also since pm = qpm−1+1 and a ≤ pm−1, we see that |X| ≤ apm/pm−1 ≤ aq+1. (cid:3)

|X ∩ Π| ≤ apm.

The following result is classical and appears, for example, as an exercise in
Hartshorne [8, Ex. I.1.8], whose solution is easily obtained using Krull’s Principal
Ideal Theorem. The assertion about the degree can also be proved directly, or it
can be readily deduced from [8, Thm. 7.7].

Lemma 2.2. Let F is an algebraically closed ﬁeld and Z be an irreducible
subvariety of Pm(F).
If Π is any hyperplane in Pm(F) such that Z is not con-
tained in Π, then Z ∩ Π is equidimensional of dimension dim Z − 1, and moreover
deg(Z ∩ Π) ≤ deg Z.

MRINMOY DATTA AND SUDHIR R. GHORPADE

As an application of Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2, we prove a reﬁned version of a
theorem of Lachaud (cf.
[7, Prop. 12.1]) for the number of points of projective
varieties deﬁned over Fq. The statement and proof, as it appears in [7, Prop.
12.1] is slightly erroneous, basically because the degree of a variety need not equal
the sum of degrees of its irreducible components. But, as is noted in [12], the
result and the proof in [7] is valid if the variety is assumed to be equidimensional.
A counterexample in the non-equidimensional case is easily obtained by taking
X = V(x0x1, x0x2) in P2, i.e., X = V(x0) ∪ V(x1, x2), which is the union of a
(projective) line and a point outside it. A “generic” complementary dimensional
linear subspace of P2 meets X in one point and thus deg X = 1 (alternatively, one
can see this by computing the Hilbert polynomial of the homogeneous ideal of X),
whereas |X(Fq)| is clearly q + 2, which is greater than 1 · p1. The proof below
appears to be somewhat simpler than that in [7, Prop. 12.1] or [12, Prop. 2.3].

Proposition 2.3. Let X ⊂ Pm(Fq) be an equidimensional variety of degree δ

and dimension s. Then

|X(Fq)| ≤ δps.

Proof. Induct on m. The case m = 1 being trivial, assume that m > 1 and
that the result holds for varieties in Pm−1(Fq). We divide the proof in three cases.

Case 1: X is contained in a hyperplane Π ∈bPm(Fq).

Hence by the induction hypothesis, |X(Fq)| ≤ δps.

In this case, X is a variety in Π ≃ Pm−1(Fq) of dimension s and degree δ.

Case 2: X is irreducible and not contained in any hyperplane in Pm(Fq).
In this case, X is nonempty (so that s ≥ 0 and δ ≥ 1). Moreover, given any

Π ∈ bPm(Fq), by Lemma 2.2, we see that X ∩ Π is an equidimensional subvariety

of Π with dim X ∩ Π = s − 1 and deg X ∩ Π ≤ δ. So by induction hypothesis,
|(X ∩Π)(Fq)| ≤ δps−1. Thus, Lemma 2.1 implies that |X(Fq)| ≤ q(δps−1)+1 ≤ δps.

Case 3: X is an arbitrary variety in Pm(Fq) of dimension s and degree δ.
In this case, write X = X1 ∪ · · · ∪ Xj ∪ Xj+1 ∪ · · · ∪ Xk, where X1, . . . , Xk
are the irreducible components of X such that none among X1, . . . , Xj is contained
in any hyperplane of Pm(Fq) whereas each of Xj+1, . . . , Xk are contained in some
hyperplane of Pm(Fq). Since X is equidimensional, dim Xi = s for all i = 1, . . . , k.
From Case 1 and Case 2, we obtain |Xi(Fq)| ≤ (deg Xi)ps for each i = 1, . . . k.
Consequently,

|X(Fq)| ≤

|Xi(Fq)| ≤  kXi=1

kXi=1

deg Xi! ps = δps.

This completes the proof.

(cid:3)

For ease of later reference, we record below optimal bounds for the number of
Fq-rational points of aﬃne or projective hypersurfaces deﬁned over Fq. For a proof,
one may refer to [13, p. 275] and [4, §2] or references therein.

Proposition 2.4. Let f ∈ Fq[x1, . . . , xm] be of degree d and let F ∈ S be a

nonzero homogeneous polynomial of degree d. Then

(i) (Ore’s Inequality) If d ≤ q, then |Z(f )| ≤ dqm−1.
(ii) (Serre’s Inequality) If d ≤ q + 1, then |V(F )| ≤ dqm−1 + pm−2.

3. TBC for Systems of Three Polynomial Equations

It is easy to see that when r ≤ m + 1, the expression in (2) simpliﬁes to

Tr(d, m) =(pm−r

(d − 1)qm−1 + pm−2 + ⌊qm−r⌋

if d = 1 and 1 ≤ r ≤ m + 1,
if d > 1 and 1 ≤ r ≤ m + 1.

In the case of homogeneous linear polynomials, i.e., when d = 1, it is obvious that
the TBC is true. Moreover, it is not diﬃcult to see that the TBC is also true when
m = 1. See, for example, [5, §2.1]. With this in view, we shall assume in this
section that d > 1 and m > 1. For any nonnegative integer j, denote by Sj the
jth homogeneous component of S = Fq[x0, x1, . . . , xm] consisting of homogeneous
polynomials in S of degree j including the zero polynomial. The main result of this
section is that the TBC is true when r = 3. In other words, we prove the following.

Theorem 3.1. Assume that m > 1 and 1 < d < q − 1. Then the maximum
number of common zeros in Pm(Fq) that a system of three linearly independent
polynomials in Sd can have is

(4)

(d − 1)qm−1 + pm−2 + ⌊qm−3⌋.

As explained in the Introduction, this is a special case of [5, Theorem 6.3]. But
the proof given here does not use the Heijnen-Pellikaan Theorem (HPT). In fact,
we follow a strategy similar to that in [5] and give diﬀerent proofs of those steps
whose proof in [5] depended on HPT.

Assume, as in Theorem 3.1, that m > 1 and 1 < d < q −1. Proceeding as in the
proof of [5, Lemma 6.1], we readily see that there do exist 3 linearly independent
polynomials in Sd whose number of common zeros in Pm(Fq) is given by (4). Now
let F1, F2, F3 be arbitrary linearly independent homogeneous polynomials of degree
d in S. To complete the proof of Theorem 3.1 it suﬃces to show that

(5)

|V(F1, F2, F3)| ≤ (d − 1)qm−1 + qm−2 + ⌊qm−3⌋.

To this end, ﬁx a GCD (= greatest common divisor) G of F1, F2, F3 and a GCD
Fij of Fi and Fj for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 3. Also let G1, G2, G3 ∈ S be such that Fi = GGi
for i = 1, 2, 3. Evidently, gcd(G1, G2, G3) = 1, that is, G1, G2, G3 are coprime.
But they may not be pairwise coprime. So we ﬁx a GCD Gij of Gi and Gj for
1 ≤ i < j ≤ 3. Note that G, Gi, Fij , Gij are all homogeneous polynomials. Let

b := deg G,

bij := deg Fij

and cij := deg Gij

for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 3.

Note that deg Gi = d − b for i = 1, 2, 3 and cij = bij − b for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 3. The
proof is divided into the following three exclusive and exhaustive cases:

(a) bij = 0 for some i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3} with i < j.
(b) 1 ≤ bij < d − 1 for some i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3} with i < j.
(c) bij = d − 1 for all i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3} with i < j.

In cases (a) and (b), Theorem 3.1, can be proved using the basic bound of Lachaud
(Proposition 2.3 of the previous section) as is shown in Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2 of [5].
Thus we restrict ourselves to the harder case, which is Case (c). Here the proof in
[5] is based on Lemma 2.5 of [5], which separates out the circumstance where the
Fi’s have a common linear factor, or equivalently, G has a linear factor, and further
based on Lemmas 5.3 and 5.4 of [5], which deal, respectively, with the subcases
b = d − 1 and b < d − 1 of Case (c) under the assumption that G has no linear
factor. Of these, Lemmas 2.5 and 5.4 of [5] use the HPT in an essential way. So

6

MRINMOY DATTA AND SUDHIR R. GHORPADE

we will now prove versions of these lemmas without recourse to HPT when r = 3.
In the remainder of this section, we shall use the following notation:

X := V(F1, F2, F3), X ′ := V(G1, G2, G3) and Y := V(G).

Now here is a counterpart of [5, Lemma 5.3] when G does have a linear factor.

Lemma 3.2. With notations as above, suppose b = d − 1 and G has a linear

factor. Then (4) holds, i.e., |X| ≤ (d − 1)qm−1 + qm−2 + ⌊qm−3⌋.

Proof. Since b = d − 1 and since F1, F2, F3 are linearly independent, the
factors G1, G2, G3 are homogeneous linear as well as linearly independent. Thus
X ′ is (isomorphic to) a projective space of dimension m − 3. Moreover, if H is a
linear factor of G, then Y ∩ X ′ contains V(G1, G2, G3, H), which is (isomorphic to)
a projective space of dimension ≥ m − 4. Since X = Y ∪ X ′, applying part (ii) of
Proposition 2.4 (Serre’s inequality) to Y = V(G), we obtain

|X| = |Y ∪ X ′| = |Y | + |X ′| − |Y ∩ X ′|

≤ (d − 1)qm−1 + pm−2 + pm−3 − pm−4
= (d − 1)qm−1 + pm−2 + ⌊qm−3⌋,

as desired.

(cid:3)

To take care of Case (c) when b < d − 1 and regardless of whether or not G

has a linear factor, we ﬁrst need a reduction given by the following.

Lemma 3.3. With notations as above, suppose bij = d − 1 for all i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3}
with i < j and suppose b < d − 1. Then b = d − 2 and there exist homogeneous
linear polynomials H1, H2, H3 ∈ S with no two of H1, H2, H3 diﬀer by a constant
(in Fq) such that G1 = H1H2, G2 = H2H3 and G3 = H3H1.

Proof. Write b = d − k and note that k ≥ 2. We claim that each Gi is a
product of k linear factors in S1, no two of which diﬀer by a constant. Indeed, if
some Gi had an irreducible factor Q ∈ S with deg Q ≥ 2, then since deg Gi = k and
the degree of a GCD of Gi and Gj is k − 1 for each j 6= i, it follows that Q divides
Gj for all j 6= i. But then this contradicts the fact that G1, G2, G3 are coprime. In
a similar manner if H 2 divides Gi for some i and some nonzero H ∈ S1, then H
divides Gj for all j 6= i, again leading to a contradiction. This proves the claim.

Thus we can write G1 = H1 . . . Hk−1Hk and G2 = H1 . . . Hk−1Hk+1 where
H1, . . . , Hk+1 ∈ S1 and no two of them diﬀer by a constant. Suppose, if possible,
b < d − 2, i.e., k ≥ 3. Then at least one among H1, . . . Hk−1 must be a factor of G3.
This contradicts the fact that G1, G2, G3 are coprime. Hence we must have k = 2,
i.e., b = d − 2, and moreover G1 = H1H2, G2 = H2H3 and G3 = H3H1.
(cid:3)

In view of the discussion and the results above, it remains to prove the following.

Lemma 3.4. With notations as above, suppose bij = d − 1 for all i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3}
with i < j and b < d−1. Then (4) holds; in fact, |X| < (d−1)qm−1+qm−2+⌊qm−3⌋.

Proof. By Lemma 3.3, b = d − 2 and moreover, G1 = H1H2, G2 = H2H3 and
G3 = H3H1 for some H1, H2, H3 ∈ S1, no two of which diﬀer by a constant. We
will now estimate |X ′| by considering two cases.
Case 1: H1, H2, H3 are linearly dependent.

TSFASMAN-BOGUSLAVSKY CONJECTURE AND PROJECTIVE REED-MULLER CODES 7

By assumption, any two among H1, H2, H3 are linearly independent. So in this
case, we can write H3 = λH1 +µH2 for some λ, µ ∈ Fq with λ 6= 0 and µ 6= 0. Hence

X ′ = V(H1H2, H2H3, H3H1) = V(H1, µH 2

2 ) ∪ V(H2, λH 2

1 ) = V(H1, H2).

In particular, |X ′| = pm−2.

Case 2: H1, H2, H3 are linearly independent.
By a linear change of coordinates, we may assume that H1 = x0, H2 = x1 and
H3 = x2. Let P = [c0 : c1 : · · · : cm] ∈ Pm be a common zero of x0x1, x1x2, x2x0.
Considering the possibilities (i) c0 = 1, (ii) c0 = 0 and c1 = 1, and (iii) c0 = c1 = 0
separately, we see that P can be chosen in exactly qm−2 + qm−2 + pm−2 ways. Thus
in this case, |X ′| = 2qm−2 + pm−2.

Thus we always have |X ′| ≤ 2qm−2 + pm−2. Also, as a consequence of Serre’s

inequality we have |Y | ≤ (d − 2)qm−1 + pm−2. Hence

|X| ≤ |X ′| + |Y |

≤ 2qm−2 + pm−2 + (d − 2)qm−1 + pm−2
= (d − 2)qm−1 + 2qm−2 + 2pm−2

The lemma will be proved if we show that

(d − 1)qm−1 + pm−2 + ⌊qm−3⌋ > (d − 2)qm−1 + 2qm−2 + 2pm−2.

To this end, let us consider the diﬀerence of the above two expressions.

(d − 1)qm−1 + pm−2 + ⌊qm−3⌋ −(cid:0)(d − 2)qm−1 + 2qm−2 + 2pm−2(cid:1)

= qm−1 − pm−2 − 2qm−2 + ⌊qm−3⌋

≥

=

qm−1(q − 1) − (qm−1 − 1) + 2qm−2(q − 1)

q − 1

qm − 4qm−1 + 2qm−2

q − 1

+ ⌊qm−3⌋.

+ ⌊qm−3⌋

The above quantity is strictly positive since q ≥ 4, thanks to the assumption d > 1
and 1 < d < q − 1. This completes the proof.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 3.1. In view of the earlier discussion, the theorem follows
(cid:3)

from Lemmas 3.2 and 3.4 together with Lemmas 4.1, 4,2, 5.3 and 6.1 of [5].

We remark that the above proof can also be adapted to the case of two linearly
independent homogeneous polynomials. This would, in fact, be a somewhat simpler
way of proving Boguslavsky’s theorem [2, Theorem 2]. At any rate, Theorem 3.1
together with Boguslavsky’s theorem and Serre’s inequality shows that
(6) er(d, m) = (d − 1)qm−1 + pm−2 + ⌊qm−r⌋

for 1 ≤ r ≤ 3 and 1 < d < q − 1.

Corollary 3.5 (Special Case of HPT). Let δ be a positive integer < q − 2.
For any linearly independent polynomials f1, f2, f3 ∈ Fq[x1, . . . , xm] of degree ≤ δ,

|Z(f1, f2, f3)| ≤ (δ − 1)qm−1 + ⌊qm−3⌋.

Proof. Homogenize f1, f2, f3 using the extra variable x0 to obtain 3 linearly
for i = 1, 2, 3.

1 , F ∗

2 , F ∗

independent polynomials, say F ∗

3 , in Sδ. Let eFi := x0F ∗
Using Theorem 3.1 applied to be eF1,eF2,eF3 in Sδ+1, we see that
|V(eF1,eF2, eF3)| ≤ δqm−1 + pm−2 + ⌊qm−3⌋.

i

8

MRINMOY DATTA AND SUDHIR R. GHORPADE

On the other hand, intersecting V(eF1,eF2,eF3) with the hyperplane V(x0) and its
complement, we ﬁnd that |V(eF1,eF2, eF3)| = pm−1 + |Z(f1, f2, f3)|. It follows that

|Z(f1, f2, f3)| ≤ (δ − 1)qm−1 + ⌊qm−3⌋.

We remark that a similar argument can be used to derive the Heijnen-Pellikaan
bound for two linearly independent polynomials using Boguslavsky’s theorem [2,
Theorem 2] and to derive Ore’s inequality from Serre’s inequality (Proposition 2.4).

(cid:3)

4. Projective Reed-Muller codes and their higher weights

The notion of higher weights (also known as generalized Hamming weights) of
a linear code is now fairly well-known and we refer to [17] for basic deﬁnitions and
results. Note that [4, Sec. 4] also gives a quick recap. The following basic result of
Wei [17] will be useful to us.

Proposition 4.1. Let C be an [n, k]q-code. Let di be the ith higher weight of
the jth higher weight of C ⊥, for i = 1, . . . , k and j = 1, . . . , n − k. Then

C and d⊥
j

(i) (Monotonicity) 1 ≤ d1 < d2 < · · · < dk ≤ n.
(ii) (Duality) {d⊥

j : j = 1, 2, . . . , n − k} = {1, . . . , n} \ {di : i = 1, 2, . . . , k}.

We shall now discuss two important examples of linear codes that are relevant
to us. The ﬁrst is quite classical and we touch upon it only brieﬂy. As before,
positive integers d and m are kept ﬁxed throughout.

4.1. Reed-Muller Codes. Let n = qm and let P1, . . . , Pn be an ordered
q . The Reed-Muller code of order d and length

listing of elements of Am(Fq), i.e., Fm
qm is denoted by RMq(d, m) and deﬁned by

RMq(d, m) := {(f (P1), . . . , f (Pn)) : f ∈ Fq[x1, . . . , xm], deg f ≤ d}.

These codes are also known as generalized Reed-Muller codes or aﬃne Reed-Muller
codes. A summary of many of their properties is given in [1, Prop. 4]. In particular,

we note that if d < q, then the dimension of RMq(d, m) is(cid:0)m+d

higher weights are related to an aﬃne analogue of er(d, m):

d (cid:1) and, as in (3), the

r (d, m),

r (d, m) denotes the maximum number of zeros in Am(Fq) that a system of
where eA
r linearly independent polynomials in Fq[x1, . . . , xm] of degree ≤ d can have. Here
is an easy consequence of Ore’s inequality and monotonicity of higher weights.

Lemma 4.2. Let k :=(cid:0)m+d

d (cid:1) and let eA

r (d, m) ≤ dqm−1 − r + 1 whenever
eA

Proof. By part (i) of Proposition 2.4, eA

r (d, m) be as deﬁned above. Then

1 ≤ r ≤ k and 1 ≤ d < q.

part (i) of Proposition 4.1, eA
follows that eA

r (d, m) ≤ eA

1 (d, m) > eA

1 (d, m) − r + 1 ≤ dqm−1 − r + 1.

2 (d, m) > · · · > eA

1 (d, m) ≤ dqm−1, whereas by (7) and
k (d, m) ≥ 0. Hence it
(cid:3)

It may be remarked that the Heijnen-Pellikaan Theorem (HPT) is a much more
general result than Lemma 4.2 above and gives a complete description of eA
r (d, m).
But of course HPT is more diﬃcult to prove, while the proof above is almost trivial.

TSFASMAN-BOGUSLAVSKY CONJECTURE AND PROJECTIVE REED-MULLER CODES 9

4.2. Projective Reed-Muller Codes. Let n = pm. We know that each
point of Pm(Fq) admits a unique representative in Fm+1
in which the ﬁrst nonzero
coordinate is 1. Let P1, . . . , Pn be an ordered listing of such representatives in Fm+1
of points of Pm(Fq). The projective Reed-Muller code of order d and length pm is
denoted by PRMq(d, m) and deﬁned by

q

q

PRMq(d, m) := {(F (P1), . . . , F (Pn)) : F ∈ Sd}.

The following two results due to Sørensen [15, Theorems 1 and 2] describe some of
the fundamental properties of projective Reed-Muller codes.

Proposition 4.3. Let 1 ≤ d ≤ m(q − 1). Then the projective Reed-Muller code

PRMq(d, m) is a nondegenerate [n, k, d′]q-code with

(i) n = pm.

(ii) k =

dXt=1

t≡d (mod q−1)



(−1)j(cid:18)m + 1
m+1Xj=0

t − jq (cid:19) .
j (cid:19)(cid:18)t − jq + m

(iii) d′ = (q − s)qm−t−1, where s and t are unique integers satisfying

d − 1 = t(q − 1) + s, with 0 ≤ s < q − 1.

Proposition 4.4. Let 1 ≤ d ≤ m(q − 1) be such that q − 1 ∤ d. Then the dual
of the projective Reed-Muller code PRM(d, m) is also a projective Reed-Muller code
PRM(d⊥, m), where d⊥ = m(q − 1) − d.

Corollary 4.5. If 1 ≤ d < q −1, then the minimum distance of PRMq(d, m)⊥

is d + 2.

Proof. By Proposition 4.4, we see that PRMq(d, m)⊥ = PRMq(d⊥, m), where

d⊥ = m(q − 1) − d. Now

d⊥ − 1 = m(q − 1) − d − 1 = (m − 1)(q − 1) + (q − d − 2)

Thus the minimum distance of PRMq(d, m)⊥ is (q−q+d+2)qm−m+1−1 = d+2. (cid:3)

The Tsfasman-Boguslavsky conjecture is very closely related to the generalized
Hamming weights or higher weights of projective Reed-Muller codes. Indeed one

observes that if d ≤ q, then for 1 ≤ r ≤(cid:0)m+d
d (cid:1),

(8)

dr (PRMq(d, m)) = pm − er(d, m),

where er(d, m) is as deﬁned in the Introduction. For more on this relation, one
may refer to [2, 4, 16]. We now derive a useful consequence of Wei duality and
monotonicity of higher weights of a linear code.

Corollary 4.6. Suppose 1 ≤ d < q and let k :=(cid:0)m+d

dk−s(PRM(d, m)) = n − s

d (cid:1). Then,

for s = 0, 1, . . . , d.

Proof. Let d⊥

1 denote the minimum distance of PRM(d, m)⊥. The duality
part of Theorem 4.1 implies that all the integers in the interval (n+1−d⊥
1 , n] will be
attained by some higher weights of PRM(d, m). Hence by Corollary 4.5, the integers
n−d, n−d+1, . . . , n are among the higher weights of PRM(d, m). By nondegeneracy
of PRM(d, m), we have dk(PRMq(d, m)) = n. Now the monotonicity of higher
weights (Theorem 4.1) implies dk−s(PRMq(d, m)) = n − s for s = 0, 1, . . . , d.

Theorem 4.7. Suppose 1 ≤ d < q and let k :=(cid:0)m+d

ek−s(d, m) = s = Tk−s(d, m)

d (cid:1). Then

s = 0, 1, . . . , d.

for

Consequently, the Tsfasman-Boguslavsky Conjecture holds in the aﬃrmative for the
last d + 1 values of r, i.e., when r = k − s for s = 0, 1, . . . , d.

Proof. From (8) and Corollary 4.6, we obtain ek−s(d, m) = s for s = 0, 1, . . . , d.
Further, it is clear that if the (m + 1)-tuples (α1, . . . , αm+1) of nonnegative integers
satisfying α1+· · ·+αm+1 = d are ordered in descending lexicographic order, then the
last d + 1 such tuples are (0, 0, . . . , 0, d, 0), (0, 0, . . . , 0, d − 1, 1), . . . , (0, 0, . . . , 0, 0, d).
In particular, for s = 0, 1, . . . , d, the (k − s)th tuple is (0, 0, . . . , 0, s, d− s) and so the
Tsfasman-Boguslavsky bound in (2) is Tk−s(d, m) = pm−2m + s(p0 − p−m) = s. (cid:3)

Example 4.8. Let us consider a small case where m = 2 and d = 2. Here

k = 6. Assume that q ≥ 4. Then from (6), we see that

e1(2, 2) = 2q + 1,

e2(2, 2) = q + 2,

and

e3(2, 2) = q + 1,

whereas by Corollary 4.7, we see that

e4(2, 2) = 2,

e5(2, 2) = 1,

and

e6(2, 2) = 0.

Using (8), we can also compute dr(PRMq(2, 2)) for r = 1, . . . , 6.

5. A Counterexample to the TBC

The aim of this section is to show that the TBC is false when m = 3, d = 2
and r = 5, i.e., for 5 quadrics in P3. Note that for these values of m, d, r, the
Tsfasman-Boguslavsky bound (2) works out to be

T5(3, 2) = 2(q + 1).

The following result shows that this isn’t the true maximum. i.e., T5(3, 2) 6= e5(3, 2),
Note that the condition d < q − 1 in the TBC translates to q > 3 when d = 2.

Theorem 5.1. Assume that q > 2. Let F1, . . . , F5 be linearly independent

homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 in Fq[x0, x1, x2, x3]. Then

Proof. Let X = V(F1, . . . , F5) ⊆ P3.

If the restrictions F1|Π, . . . , Fr|Π are

|V(F1, . . . , F5)| ≤ 2q + 1.

|X ∩ Π| ≤ e5(2, 2) = 1

Hence Lemma 2.1 shows that |X| ≤ q + 1 ≤ 2q + 1.

linearly independent for every hyperplane Π ∈bP3, then by Example 4.8, we obtain
Now let us suppose there exists Π ∈ bP3 such that F1|Π, . . . , F5|Π are linearly

dependent. By a projective linear change of coordinates, if necessary, we may
assume that Π = V (x0). Let F denote the Fq-vector subspace of Fq[x0, x1, x2, x3]
generated by F1, . . . , F5, and let

for every Π ∈bP3.

FΠ := {F ∈ F : x0 | F },

s = dim FΠ

and

t := 5 − s.

Since a nontrivial Fq-linear combination of F1, . . . , F5 vanishes on Π, we ﬁnd s ≥ 1.
Also elements of FΠ are of the form x0L, where L is a homogeneous linear poly-
nomial in Fq[x0, x1, x2, x3]. The space of such homogeneous linear polynomials has
dimension 4, and so s ≤ 4. Hence 1 ≤ t ≤ 4. Choose a basis F ∗
5 of F such
that F ∗

5 ∈ FΠ. Evidently, V(F1, . . . , F5) = V(F ) = V(F ∗

i |Π and fi = F ∗

i |Πc for i = 1, . . . , 5, where Πc denotes the complement of
Gi = F ∗
Π in Pm. Thus Gi’s are obtained from F ∗
i ’s by putting x0 = 0, while fi’s are ob-
tained from F ∗
i ’s by putting x0 = 1. Note that G1, . . . , Gt are linearly independent
homogeneous polynomials in Fq[x1, x2, x3] of degree 2, while Gt+1 = · · · = G5 = 0,
whereas f1, . . . , f5 are linearly independent (possibly nonhomogeneous) polynomials
in Fq[x1, x2, x3] with deg fi = 2 for i = 1, . . . , t and deg fi ≤ 1 for i = t + 1, . . . , 5.
We now make a case-by-case analysis.

t = 1.

Case 1:
Since f2, f3, f4, f5 are linearly independent elements of the vector space of
polynomials in Fq[x1, x2, x3] of degree ≤ 1 and since this vector space has di-
mension 4, we see that 1 is a linear combination of f2, f3, f4, f5. Consequently,
|X ∩ Πc| ≤ |Z(f2, f3, f4, f5)| = 0. On the other hand, from Example 4.8, we see
that |X ∩ Π| = |V(G1)| ≤ e1(2, 2) = 2q + 1. It follows that |X| ≤ 2q + 1.

t = 2.

Case 2:
Here, f3, f4, f5 are three linearly independent (possibly nonhomogeneous) linear
polynomials in 3 variables. Hence the system of linear equations f3 = f4 = f5 = 0
can have at most 1 solution. Thus |X ∩ Πc| ≤ 1. On the other hand, Example 4.8
shows that |X ∩ Π| = |V(G1, G2)| ≤ e2(2, 2) = q + 2. Consequently, |X| ≤ q + 3.

Case 3:
By a similar argument as in Case 2, we observe that |X ∩ Πc| ≤ q. On the

t = 3.

other hand, |X ∩ Π| = |V(G1, G2, G3)| ≤ e3(2, 2) = q + 1. Thus, |X| ≤ 2q + 1.

t = 4.

Case 4:
Here, |X ∩ Π| = |V(G1, G2, G3, G4)| ≤ e4(2, 2) = 2 and so it suﬃces to show
that |X ∩ Πc| = |Z(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5)| ≤ 2q − 1. To this end, ﬁrst note that if
deg f5 = 0, then |Z(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5)| = 0, and we are done. Thus we may assume
that f5 is of degree 1 in Fq[x1, x2, x3] and so F ∗
5 = x0(a0x0 + a1x1 + a2x2 + a3x3)
for some a0, a1, a2, a3 ∈ Fq with (a1, a2, a3) 6= (0, 0, 0). By a homogeneous linear
change of variables leaving x0 unchanged, we can assume without loss of generality
that F ∗
5 = x0x1; in particular, f5 = x1. Now let P be the Fq-vector subspace
of Fq[x1, x2, x3] generated by f1, . . . , f5. Note that substituting x0 = 1 gives an
isomorphism of F onto P. Further, if we let

P1 := {f ∈ P : x1 | f },

s′ = dim P1

and

t′ := 5 − s′,

then P1 is isomorphic to F1 := {F ∈ F : x1 | F }. Also as in in the case of
FΠ, we see that 1 ≤ s′ ≤ 4. Moreover if s′ = 4, i.e., if t′ = 1, then arguing as in
Case 1 above, but with x0 and x1 interchanged, we directly ﬁnd |X| ≤ 2q + 1. Thus
suppose t′ > 1. Replacing f1, . . . , f5 by a suitable basis of P, we may suppose
that ft′+1, . . . , f5 constitute a basis of P1 and no nontrivial linear combination of
f1, . . . , ft′ is in P1. Now if we write fj = x1gj + hj for unique gj ∈ Fq[x1, x2, x3]
of degree ≤ 1 and hj ∈ Fq[x2, x3] of degree ≤ 2 (1 ≤ j ≤ t′), then h1, . . . , ht′ are
linearly independent and if Z(h1, . . . , ht′) denotes their zero set in A2, then

|Z(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5)| = |Z(h1, . . . , ht′ )| ≤ eA

t′(2, 2) ≤ 2q − t′ + 1 ≤ 2q − 1,

where the last two inequalities follows from Lemma 4.2 and the fact that t′ > 1.
This completes the proof.

It would be interesting to determine er(d, m) for all permissible values of r, d, m,

especially when r ≥ m + 1 and d ≤ q. In [5] a conjecture is made for r ≤(cid:0)m+d−1
m (cid:1)

and d < q, but this is open, in general.
