We report on the results of the E06-014 experiment performed at Jeﬀerson Lab in Hall A, where
a precision measurement of the twist-3 matrix element d2 of the neutron (dn
2 ) was conducted. The
quantity dn
2 represents the average color Lorentz force a struck quark experiences in a deep inelastic
electron scattering event oﬀ a neutron due to its interaction with the hadronizing remnants. This
color force was determined from a linear combination of the third moments of the 3He spin structure
functions, g1 and g2, after nuclear corrections had been applied to these moments. The structure
functions were obtained from a measurement of the unpolarized cross section and of double-spin
asymmetries in the scattering of a longitudinally polarized electron beam from a transversely and
a longitudinally polarized 3He target. The measurement kinematics included two average Q2 bins
of 3.2 GeV2 and 4.3 GeV2, and Bjorken-x 0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.90 covering the deep inelastic and resonance

INTRODUCTION

A. Overview of nucleon structure

Experiments utilizing the scattering of leptons from
nucleons have been instrumental in uncovering the com-
plex structure of subatomic matter over the past half
century. In the mid-1950s, elastic scattering of electrons
from hydrogen revealed that the proton is not a point-
like particle but has internal structure [1]; in the 1970s,
deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) of electrons from hydro-
gen showed that point-like particles, labeled “partons,”
are the underlying constituents of the proton [2]. These
partons were later identiﬁed as quarks and gluons in the
modern theory of strong interactions, quantum chromo-
dynamics (QCD) [3].

Since the late 1970s, scattering of polarized lepton
beams from polarized nucleons and polarized light nu-
clear targets (deuterium and 3He) has given us the op-
portunity to probe the spin structure of the nucleon en-
coded in the g1 and g2 spin-structure functions. In par-
ticular, worldwide DIS studies focusing on g1 as a func-
tion of both Bjorken-x and Q2 allowed the determination
of the fraction of the proton spin that is carried by the
quarks [4, 5] and by the gluons [6, 7]. Here, x is inter-
preted as the fractional momentum of the parent nucleon
carried by the struck quark in the inﬁnite momentum
frame, and Q2 ≡ −q2 is the four-momentum transferred
to the target squared.
Early theoretical work [8] has shown that the g1(x, Q2)
and g2(x, Q2) spin-structure functions contain informa-
tion on quark-gluon correlations. These dynamical eﬀects
are accessible through the Q2-variations of these func-
tions beyond those of the calculable perturbative QCD
(pQCD) radiative corrections [9].
In fact, they appear
in an expansion of both the measured g1 spin-structure
function and its moments in x in powers of 1/Q2, but
only at higher order.
In contrast, in the measured g2
spin-structure function, quark-gluon interactions are ac-

∗ ﬂay@umass.edu
† Deceased
‡ meziani@temple.edu

cessible at leading order in a similar expansion and thus
suﬀer no 1/Q2 suppression. This makes measurements
of g2 particularly sensitive and important for studying
multi-parton correlations in the nucleon.

Studies of the moments in x of spin-structure functions
have resulted in fundamental tests of QCD like that of
the Bjorken sum rule [10]; here, not only do they of-
fer an opportunity to test our understanding of pQCD
beyond the simple partonic picture, but they also allow
for measured observables to be tested against ab initio
calculations of lattice QCD. While there is a wealth of
data available for g1, fewer data exist for g2—especially
in the valence region. This region provides the dominant
contribution to higher moments. These moments are of
interest because the contribution arising from the lower-
x region of integration, where the structure functions are
unknown, is small. Thus these higher moments oﬀer ro-
bust experimental results relevant for a comparison with
lattice QCD, for example. Finally, it is worth noting that
high-precision data of the g1 nucleon structure function
in the valence region of deep inelastic scattering—namely
x ≥ 0.6—are still sparse, and every new data set with
good precision oﬀers a real possibility to test nucleon
models in a domain sensitive to those models’ parame-
ters.

B. The g2 structure function and quark-gluon

correlations

While the polarized structure function g2 has no clear
interpretation in the quark-parton model [11], it is known
to contain quark-gluon correlations, and can be decom-
posed as:

g2(cid:0)x, Q2(cid:1) = gWW

2

(cid:0)x, Q2(cid:1) + ¯g2(cid:0)x, Q2(cid:1) ,

where ¯g2 is the component of g2 that contains the quark-
gluon correlations [8], given by [12]:

(1)

¯g2(cid:0)x, Q2(cid:1) =Z 1

.(2)

Here, hT denotes the transversity distribution in the nu-
cleon [13], ξ the quark-gluon correlation function, mq the

quark mass of ﬂavor q and M the nucleon mass. The
quantity gWW
in Eq. 1 is the Wandzura-Wilczek term,
which is fully determined from the knowledge of the g1
structure function [14]:

Under the operator product expansion (OPE) [15], one
can access the eﬀects of quark-gluon correlations via the
third moment of a linear combination of g1 and g2:

d2(cid:0)Q2(cid:1) = 3Z 1
=Z 1

x2(cid:2)2g1(cid:0)x, Q2(cid:1) + 3g2(cid:0)x, Q2(cid:1)(cid:3) dx. (4)

Because of the x2-weighting, d2 is particularly sensitive
to the large-x behavior of ¯g2. The quantity d2 is related
to a speciﬁc twist-3 (τ = 3) matrix element consisting of
local operators of quark and gluon ﬁelds [13, 16, 17]:

2M P +P +Sxd2 = ghP, S| ¯ψ(0)γ+G+y(0)ψ(0)|P, Si,(5)
where P denotes the nucleon momentum, S its spin,
ψ the quark ﬁeld, and g the QCD coupling constant.
The + superscript indicates the equation is expressed
in light-cone coordinates. In analogy to the electromag-
netic Lorentz force F y that acts on a charged particle,

the gluon ﬁeld G+y = (Bx − Ey) /√2 = F y, where Bx

and Ey are the transverse components of the color mag-
netic and color electric ﬁeld, respectively; the z direction
is deﬁned by the three-momentum transfer of the virtual
photon [17].

There are two interpretations of d2 in the literature.
The ﬁrst connects d2 with color electromagnetic ﬁelds
induced in a transversely polarized nucleon probed by a
virtual photon. These induced color ﬁelds (appearing in
Eq. 5) are represented as color polarizabilities χ [13]:

χE ~S =

χB ~S =

2M 2hP, S|ψ†g~a × ~Eψ|P, Si
1
2M 2hP, S|ψ†g ~Bψ|P, Si,

(6)

(7)

where ~a denotes the velocity of the struck quark. Then,
d2 can be expressed as:

where the last equality is true only in the rest frame of
the nucleon [17].

Combining measurements of d2 with the twist-4 matrix
element f2 allows the extraction of the color electric and
magnetic forces F y

E and F y

f2 = −

(11)

(12)

The quantity f2 is sensitive to quark-gluon correlations,
since it is expressed as a matrix element similar to d2,
containing a mixed quark-gluon ﬁeld operator [8, 18–20].
The f2 matrix element cannot be measured directly, but
can be extracted from g1 data by utilizing a twist expan-
sion of Γ1, the ﬁrst moment of g1:

(13)

For simplicity the Q2-dependence of the structure func-
tions, matrix elements and µn terms has been omitted in

Eq. 13. The quantity a2 =R x2g1dx is the third moment

of g1, a twist-2 matrix element that has connections to
target mass corrections. The term µ6 is a higher-twist
(τ > 4) term. The quantity µ2 is the twist-2 contribu-
tion, given as:

µ2(cid:0)Q2(cid:1) = Cns(cid:0)Q2(cid:1)(cid:18)−

(14)
where Cns and Cs denote the non-singlet and singlet Wil-
son coeﬃcients [21], gA the ﬂavor-triplet axial charge, a8
the octet axial charge and ∆Σ the singlet axial charge.
The f2 matrix element can be extracted from Eq. 13 by
ﬁrst subtracting µ2 from Γ1 and then ﬁtting the result
as a function of 1/Q2.

d2 =

1
4

(χE + 2χB) .

In practice, in order to access the spin-structure func-
tions g1 and g2, we measure experimental asymmetries:

(8)

A second, more recent interpretation shows that the
matrix element connected to d2 represents an average
color Lorentz force F y acting on the struck quark due to
the remnant di-quark system at the instant it is struck
by the virtual photon (cf. Eq. 5):

(16)

The quantity σsS denotes the polarized cross section for
electron spin s and target spin S. The ↑ (↓) indicates
the electron spin parallel (antiparallel) to its momentum,
and ⇑ (⇓) indicates the target spin parallel (antiparallel)
to the electron beam momentum. The ⇐ (⇒) indicates
the target spin perpendicular to the beam momentum,
pointing away from (towards) the side of the beamline
on which the scattered electron is detected. The quan-
tity y = (E−E′)/E is the fractional energy transferred to
the target, with E being the electron beam energy and
E′ the scattered electron energy, with E and E′ mea-
sured in the laboratory frame. The quantity α denotes
the electromagnetic coupling constant and θ the electron
scattering angle. The quantity σ0 is the unpolarized elec-
tron scattering cross section. The dependence of g1, g2
and σ0 on x and Q2 has been suppressed for simplicity.
The two spin structure functions g1 and g2 can be ex-
pressed in terms of the experimental observables Ak, A⊥
and σ0 by combining and inverting Eqs. 16 and 17. Then
the expression for d2 in Eq. 4 can be re-written in terms
of those experimental observables:

The prior world data for dn

2 as a function of Q2 [22] are
presented in Fig. 1. The top panel shows measured data
and model calculations without the elastic contribution,
while the bottom panel shows the same data and models
with the elastic contribution included. Resonance mea-
surements from JLab E94-010 [23] and RSS [24], along
with resonance plus DIS data from E01-012 [25], are
shown at Q2 . 3 GeV2. At large Q2 towards 5 GeV2 are
DIS measurements from SLAC E155x [26] and the com-
bined data from JLab E99-117 and SLAC E155x [27]. In
the latter data set, dn
2 was evaluated by combining the
gn
2 data from JLab E99-117 with the g2 data of SLAC

4

E155x, and ¯g2 was assumed to be Q2-independent and
to follow ¯g2 ∝ (1− x)m with m = 2 or 3 for x & 0.78 [26],
for which there were no data from either experiment [27].
The solid curve in Fig. 1 is from a MAID [28] cal-
culation, which uses phenomenelogical ﬁts to electro-
and photoproduction data for the nucleon, extending
from the single-pion production threshold to the reso-
nance/DIS boundary at W = 2 GeV. The major reso-
nances are modeled using Breit-Wigner functions to con-
struct the production channels. The bottom panel dis-
plays the results of additional model calculations from a
QCD sum rule approach [29, 30], which in general uses
dispersion relations, combined with the OPE, to inter-
polate between the perturbative and non-perturbative
regimes of QCD. The two calculations presented at Q2 ≈
1 GeV2 use a three-quark ﬁeld with [29] (oﬀset lower in
Q2 in Fig. 1) and without [30] a gluon ﬁeld. A chiral soli-
ton model [31] is shown, where the nucleon is described
as a non-linear dynamical system consisting of “mesonic
lumps” [31] governed by a U (1) × SU (2)L × SU (2)R chi-
ral symmetry. Another model displayed is a bag model,
in which the quarks are conﬁned to a nucleon “bag.”
Here, the conﬁnement mechanism of QCD is simulated
using quark-gluon and gluon-gluon interactions [32]. The
model also includes generalized spin-dependent eﬀects
via an explicit symmetry-breaking parameter [33]. A lat-
tice QCD calculation [34] is also presented, which solves
the dynamical QCD equations non-perturbatively on a
discretized lattice. The model calculations that include
the elastic contribution are shown in the lower panel only.
We added the elastic contribution to the MAID model in
the lower panel. Our measurement focused on the mod-
erately large-Q2 region of 3 < Q2 < 5 GeV2, where the
elastic contribution is seen to be small (lower panel of
Fig. 1) and where a theoretical interpretation in terms of
twist-3 contributions is cleaner.

While bag [32, 35, 36] and soliton [31] model calcula-
tions of d2 for the neutron yield numerical values con-
sistent with those of lattice QCD [34], prior experimen-
tal data diﬀer by roughly two standard deviations in
the large Q2-range. This is illustrated by the data for
Q2 ≈ 5 GeV2 in Fig. 1. This situation called for a ded-
icated experiment for the neutron, JLab E06-014. For
the proton d2, the measurements and models are in bet-
ter agreement [26, 29–32, 34, 37]. These data sets will
be further extended by a recent measurement [38] whose
precision results are expected in the near future. Un-
der the assumption of isospin symmetry, combining the
neutron and proton data would then allow a ﬂavor de-
composition to determine the average color force felt by
the up and down quarks in the proton. Measurements of
d2 access similar forces as those that cause quark conﬁne-
ment. Consequently, such measurements are important
for understanding the dynamics of the constituents of the
nucleon.

Our measurements of the unpolarized cross section σ0
and the double-spin asymmetries Ak and A⊥ allow the
extraction of d2, and in turn, f2. Combining our re-

a lattice QCD [34] calculation is shown. The model calcula-
tions that include the elastic contribution are shown in the

MAID model in the lower panel. The elastic contribution to
dn

using the Cornwall-Norton (CN) moments (see Appendix B)
where the Riordan [39] and Kelly [40] parameterizations are
used for Gn

lizing our data on g1, we also evaluate the twist-2 matrix
element a2 and test it against lattice QCD calculations.

C. A1 and ﬂavor decomposition

The measurement of the double-spin asymmetries Ak
and A⊥ required for the extraction of d2 also gives ac-

with γ2 = (2M x)2 /Q2.

(25)

The A1 asymmetry is particularly sensitive to the way
that the quark spins combine to give the nucleon spin.
Therefore, A1 is a good discriminator for various model
calculations that aim to describe the spin structure of
the nucleon. Figure 2 shows the previous world data
from SLAC E142 [42] and E154 [43], HERMES [44],
and JLab E99-117 [27, 45] compared to various models.
It is seen that the relativistic constituent quark model
(RCQM) [46] describes the trend of the data reasonably
well. The pQCD parameterization with hadron helicity
conservation (HHC) [47] (dashed)—assuming quark or-
bital angular momentum to be zero—does not describe
the data adequately. However, the pQCD model allowing
for quark orbital angular momentum to be non-zero [48]
(dash-dotted) is in good agreement with the data, sug-
gesting the importance of quark orbital angular momen-
tum in the spin structure of the nucleon. The statistical
quark model (solid) [49], which interprets the constituent
partons as fermions (quarks) and bosons (gluons), ade-
quately describes the trend of the world data after ﬁt-
ting its parameters to a subset of the available data.
A modiﬁed NJL model from Clo¨et et al. (dash triple-
dotted) [50] is shown to ﬁt the data accurately in the
large-x region. This NJL-type model imposes constraints
for conﬁnement such that unphysical thresholds for nu-
cleon decay into quarks are excluded. Nucleon states are
obtained by solving the Faddeev equation using a quark-
diquark approximation, including scalar and axial-vector
diquark states. Relatively recent predictions come from
Dyson-Schwinger Equation (DSE) treatments by Roberts
et al. [51], which reveal non-pointlike diquark correlations
in the nucleon due to dynamical chiral symmetry break-
ing.
employ two
diﬀerent types of dressed-quark propagators for the Fad-
deev equation: one where the mass term is momentum-

In these calculations Roberts et al.

independent, and the other where the mass term car-
ries a momentum dependence. This yields two diﬀerent
sets of results, referred to as contact and realistic, respec-
tively. The predictions for the two approaches are shown
at x = 1 (Fig. 2). We note the contrast between the
DSE predictions and those from pQCD and constituent
quark models, where the latter two predict An
1 → 1 as
x → 1. The measurement presented here provides more
contiguous coverage over the region of 0.27 < x < 0.60
compared to the JLab E99-117 measurement [27, 45].

for (∆u + ∆¯u)/(u + ¯u) and (∆d + ∆ ¯d)/(d + ¯d) are shown
in Fig. 3, where the data in the upper (lower) part of
the ﬁgure represent the up (down) quark ratio. The data
shown are from HERMES [52] and COMPASS [53], both
semi-inclusive DIS measurements, and JLab experiments
E99-117 [27] and CLAS EG1b [54], both of which are in-
clusive DIS measurements. The semi-inclusive DIS data
from HERMES and COMPASS are constructed from
their published polarized PDF data, where we used the
same unpolarized PDF parameterizations as were applied
in the original analyses: CTEQ5L [55] for the HER-
MES data, and MRST2006 [56] for the COMPASS data.
The uncertainties are thus slightly larger than could be
achieved from the raw data. The dashed (dash-dotted)
curve represents the pQCD calculation which requires
HHC [47] (includes orbital angular momentum [48]). The
solid curve represents the statistical quark model [49],
and the dash triple-dotted curve is a modiﬁed NJL
model [50]. At x = 1, DSE calculations [51] are indi-
cated by open stars (crosses) for the up (down) quark ra-
tios. Clearly, both pQCD models predict that ∆q/q → 1
at large x, which implies that the positive helicity state
of the quark (quark spin aligned with the nucleon spin)
must dominate as x → 1. The data for (∆u+∆¯u)/(u+ ¯u)
are consistent with this prediction; however, we note that
the current (∆d+∆ ¯d)/(d+ ¯d) data show no sign of turning
positive as we approach the large x region. The Avakian
et al. calculation ﬁts the down quark data better, but
still has a zero-crossing at x ∼ 0.75. The data in Fig. 3
imply that in general, the up quark spins tend to be par-
allel to the nucleon spin, whereas the down quark spins
are antiparallel to the nucleon spin. The trend of the
down quark data, supported by the model of Avakian et
al., suggests that quark orbital angular momentum might
play an important role in the spin of the nucleon. The ex-
periment presented here aims to provide more complete
kinematic coverage for the down quark, especially in the
large-x region approaching x ∼ 0.6, where the predic-
tions of the pQCD models start to contrast with those of
the constituent quark models and the DSE calculations.

II. THE EXPERIMENT

The E06-014 experiment ran in Hall A of Thomas Jef-
ferson National Accelerator Facility (Jeﬀerson Lab or
JLab) for six weeks in ﬁve run periods from February
to March of 2009, consisting of a commissioning run
using 1.2 GeV electrons, a 5.89 GeV run using polar-
ized electrons, a 4.74 GeV run using unpolarized elec-
trons, and ﬁnally runs using polarized electrons at en-
ergies of 5.89 GeV and 4.74 GeV. The data at 4.74 GeV
and 5.89 GeV were the production data sets, which cov-

and x. The lower band represents the E = 4.74 GeV data
set and the upper band the E = 5.89 GeV one. The black
dashed line shows W = 2 GeV. The regions to the left and
right of this line correspond to DIS and resonance kinematics,
respectively.

Polarized electrons were scattered from a polarized 3He
target, which acts as an eﬀective polarized neutron tar-
get [58]. The scattered electrons were detected indepen-
dently in the Left High-Resolution Spectrometer (LHRS)
and in the BigBite Spectrometer, that were oriented at
a scattering angle of θ = 45◦ to the left and right of
the beamline, respectively. The unpolarized cross section
σ0 was extracted from the LHRS data and the double-
spin asymmetries Ak and A⊥ were obtained from the
BigBite data. The matrix element d2 was computed us-
ing Eq. 17, and the virtual photon asymmetry A1 and
structure function ratio g1/F1 were extracted according
to Eqs. 18 and 19, respectively.

The measurement with the BigBite spectrometer con-
sisted of twenty evenly spaced, continuous bins in x with
a bin width of 0.05 for each beam energy; of these,
seven were discarded because of insuﬃcient statistics.
The statistics in all bins for a given beam energy were
recorded simultaneously. The LHRS data were acquired
in nine unevenly spaced bins in the scattered electron
momentum p for the E = 4.74 GeV run and eleven un-
evenly spaced bins for the E = 5.89 GeV run, covering a
range of 0.6 ≤ p ≤ 1.7 GeV as listed in Tables I and II.
The statistics in the LHRS were recorded sequentially.
For the d2 extraction, the measured cross sections were
interpolated and extrapolated to match the binning of
the BigBite data.

The experimental run plan optimized its statistics on
the d2 integral (Eq. 17) in order to minimize the error

A. The polarized electron beam

The high-energy longitudinally polarized electron
beam is provided by the Continuous Electron Beam Ac-
celerator Facility (CEBAF) at JLab [59]. Polarized elec-
trons are produced by shining circularly polarized laser
light on a strained superlattice GaAs photo-cathode.
This produces electrons with a polarization of up to
∼ 85% at currents up to ∼ 200 µA. High-energy electrons
are achieved by two superconducting radio-frequency
(RF) linear accelerators connected by two magnetic re-
circulating arcs. The beam may be circulated around the
racetrack accelerator up to a maximum of ﬁve times to
achieve an energy of ∼ 6 GeV [59].

B. Beam helicity

8

Each window had a deﬁnite helicity state in which the
electron spin was either parallel (+) or anti-parallel (−)
to the beam direction. Helicity windows were organized
into quartets, taking the form + − −+ or − + +−. The
helicity state of the ﬁrst window of the quartet was de-
cided by a pseudo-random number generator, and in turn
deﬁned the helicity state for the remaining windows. A
signal indicating the helicity of each window was sent to
the data acquisition (DAQ) systems.

At the electron source a half-wave plate can be inserted
into the path of the laser illuminating the strained GaAs
source to reverse the helicity of the extracted polarized
electrons relative to the helicity signal. This was done for
about half of the statistics to minimize possible system-
atic eﬀects due to the helicity bit. The asymmetry in the
amount of charge delivered with the two helicity states
was found to be negligible [60]; this was accomplished
using a feedback loop and a specialized data acquisition
system developed by a previous JLab experiment [61].

To determine the actual sign of the electrons’ helic-
ity state for each window type, a measurement of the
quasi-elastic 3He asymmetry was made and compared to
a theoretical calculation [62]. For more details, see Sec-
tion IV C.

C. Hall A overview

The layout of the Hall A hardware for this experiment
is shown in Fig. 5. Along the beamline are beam diagnos-
tic tools, like the beam current monitors (BCMs), beam
position monitors (BPMs), and the Møller and Comp-
ton polarimeters. A polarized 3He target was utilized as
an eﬀective polarized neutron target. Scattered electrons
were measured independently in the LHRS and the Big-
Bite spectrometers, each equipped with a gas ˇCerenkov
detector and electromagnetic calorimeters for particle
identiﬁcation (PID) purposes. In the LHRS quadrupole
and dipole magnets are used to focus charged particles
into the detector stack, while a single dipole magnet
bends charged particles into the BigBite detector stack.
In each spectrometer wire drift chambers are used to re-
construct particle tracks. Each of these elements will be
described in the following sections.

D. The Hall A beamline

To control certain systematic errors associated with
the electron beam polarization during the experiment,
the helicity of the electrons was ﬂipped every 33 ms. This
time frame was referred to as a helicity window, and suc-
cessive windows were separated by master pulse signals.

The beamline in Hall A contains a number of impor-
tant diagnostic components: BCMs, BPMs and the po-
larimetry apparatus. We ﬁrst discuss the BCMs and
BPMs in Section II D 1, followed by the beam polariza-
tion measurements in Section II D 2. The measurement
of the beam energy is presented in Section II D 3.

9

The diﬀerences between the signals in pairs of wires in a
given plane yields a positional resolution of 100 µm [64].
Combining the measurements of the two BPMs yields the
trajectory of the beam; extrapolating these data gives the
position at the target. The BPMs were calibrated using
wire scanners called harps. A single harp was located
immediately downstream of each BPM. Harp measure-
ments allow the relative position measurements from the
BPMs to be tied to the Hall A coordinate system. They
interfered with the beam, so dedicated runs called “bull’s
eye” scans were needed. A “bull’s eye” scan consisted of
ﬁve measurements with (x, y) data points in the plane
perpendicular to the beam momentum with the beam
positioned at diﬀerent locations. Four of these points de-
scribed the corners of a 4 mm by 4 mm square, and the
ﬁfth data point measured the square’s center [62].

In order to avoid damage to the glass target cell due
to beam heating, the beam was rastered (scanned) at
high speeds (17–24 kHz) across a large rectangular cross

section (cid:0)≈ 4 × 6 mm2(cid:1) at the target. This rectangular

distribution was achieved by two dipole magnets (one for
vertical, one for horizontal) located 23 m upstream of the
target [63].

2. Beam polarization measurement

The polarization of the electron beam was measured
using two diﬀerent polarimeters, a Møller and a Compton
polarimeter. Møller polarimetry utilizes scattering the
polarized electron beam from polarized atomic electrons
in a magnetized iron foil. The scattering rate is propor-
tional to the beam and foil polarizations [63, 65, 66]. Such
a measurement required the insertion of a magnetized
foil into the beam path which inhibited normal data-
taking. A total of seven Møller measurements were made
during the course of the experiment. This method has
sub-percent statistical accuracy, but a sizable systematic
uncertainty mainly due to uncertainty in the target foil
polarization. The total relative systematic uncertainty
on the Møller measurement during this experiment was
∼ 2%.
The Compton polarimeter utilized ~e-~γ scattering to de-
termine the polarization of the electron beam as the in-
teraction is sensitive to the relative polarizations of the
electrons and photons [67, 68]. The newly commissioned
polarimeter consisted of a magnetic chicane which de-
ﬂected the electron beam towards a photon source and
deﬂected unscattered electrons back towards the original
beam path. At the center of the chicane was the pho-
ton source, a 700 mW laser at a wavelength of 1064 nm.
The laser output was 400–500 W with a resonant Fabry-
P´erot cavity [69]. The laser polarization for the left- and
right-circular polarization states was 99% ± 0.02% dur-
ing the experiment [62]. There was also an electromag-
netic calorimeter, a Gd2SiO5 (GSO) crystal doped with
cerium, for detecting scattered photons [70]. The elec-
tron detector was not used in this experiment.

tal setup for E06-014. The longitudinally polarized electron
beam enters from the left and scatters from the longitudi-
nally or transversely polarized 3He target, which is discussed
in Section III. The Møller and Compton polarimeters provide
beam polarization measurements, presented in Section II D 2.
The LHRS and BigBite spectrometers are positioned at 45◦
with respect to the beamline and detect scattered electrons.

1. Beam charge and position monitoring

The experiment ran at beam currents of ∼15 µA. Fluc-
tuations about the required value and beam trips, due to
diﬃculties in the accelerator or in the other two exper-
imental halls, make it important to monitor the beam
current. To this purpose two BCMs, which are reso-
nant RF cavities, are utilized. These cavities, stainless-
steel cylinders with a Q-factor of ∼ 3000, were tuned
to the fundamental beam frequency of 1.497 GHz. The
two BCMs were located 25 m upstream of the target,
where one cavity was denoted as upstream and the other
as downstream, based on their relative positions along
the beamline. Each produced a voltage signal that was
proportional to the measured current. Three copies of
the signal were recorded, each ampliﬁed by a diﬀerent
gain factor (1, 3 or 10), resulting in six signals altogether
(three for each cavity) [63]. Each copy of the signal was
ampliﬁed by its assigned gain and then sent to a voltage-
to-frequency converter. These signals were calibrated us-
ing a Faraday cup [62]. Each signal was read out by
scalers in the LHRS and BigBite spectrometers.

For accurate vertex reconstruction and proper momen-
tum calculation for each detected electron, the position of
the electron beam in the plane transverse to the nominal
beam direction at the target was needed. The measure-
ment of the beam position was accomplished through the
use of two BPMs. They each consisted of four antenna
arrays placed ∼ 7.5 m and ∼ 1.3 m upstream of the tar-
get. Pairs of wires were positioned at ±45◦ relative to
the horizontal and vertical directions in the hall. The
signal induced in the wires by the beam was inversely
proportional to the distance from the beam to the wires,
and was recorded by analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

The electron polarization was extracted from an asym-
metry in the rate of scattering circularly polarized pho-
tons from the longitudinally polarized electrons, between
two unique spin conﬁgurations:
electron and photon
spins parallel and antiparallel. The energy-weighted, in-
tegrated asymmetry was measured in a new integrating
DAQ and then combined with the polarimeter’s theoret-
ically calculated analyzing power to determine the elec-
tron beam polarization [70, 71]. Since Compton po-
larimetry is a non-invasive measurement, polarization
measurements could be performed in parallel with data-
taking.

Combining the results of the Møller and Compton mea-
surements for the three production run periods with po-
larized beam resulted in a beam polarization of 74%±1%
(E = 5.89 GeV), 79%±1% (E = 5.89 GeV) and 63%±1%
(E = 4.74 GeV) [62].

3. Beam energy measurement

The beam energy was monitored throughout the exper-
iment using the so-called Tiefenback method [72], which
combined BPM measurements and the estimated integral
of the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the Hall A arc magnets.
This method was calibrated against an invasive “Arc En-
ergy” measurement. This measurement used the results
of a detailed ﬁeld mapping of all nine arc dipoles (includ-
ing the reference one) after following a controlled exci-
tation. In the actual Arc Energy measurement, all nine
dipoles were excited following the same curve and the
ﬁeld was measured in the ninth dipole. The actual deﬂec-
tion of the beam was then measured and the beam energy
was computed from the deviation from the nominal bend
angle of 34.3◦. The uncertainty on such a measurement
was δE/E ≈ 2 × 10−4 [73]. Arc measurements were not
performed during this experiment but were done for the
immediately preceding experiment, E06-010 [74]. Their
arc measurement was used as a reference for the Tiefen-
back measurements. The arc measurement conducted
during E06-010 for ∼ 6 GeV beam energies yielded a
value of 5889.4 ± 0.5stat ± 1syst MeV, while the Tiefen-
back measurement yielded 5891.3 ± 2.5syst MeV [74]. In
our data analysis we used the Tiefenback measurements
without correcting for the diﬀerence relative to the arc
measurement, which was ≪ 1%.

E. The spectrometers

1. The Left High-Resolution Spectrometer

The Hall A high-resolution spectrometers were de-
signed for in-depth studies of the structure of nuclei and
nucleons. The LHRS has high resolution in both the mo-
mentum and angle reconstruction of the scattered par-
ticles, in addition to the capability of running at high
luminosity.

10

At the entrance of the LHRS there are two super-
conducting quadrupoles, for focusing the charged par-
ticles, followed by a superconducting dipole magnet that
bends the charged particles upwards through a nominal
45◦ bending angle. After this, the particles pass through
through a third quadrupole before entering the detector
stack. The LHRS has an angular acceptance of 6 msr,
for a horizontal (vertical) angular resolution of 0.5 mrad
(1 mrad). The momentum acceptance is 10% with a mo-
mentum resolution of 10−4. The designed maximum cen-
tral momentum is 4 GeV [63].

For E06-014 the LHRS detector stack was composed
of a number of sub-packages, located in the shield hut
at the end of the magnet conﬁguration. The detector
sub-packages included vertical drift chambers (VDCs),
which provided tracking information for scattered parti-
cles, and the S1 and S2m scintillating planes served as
the main trigger. Finally, the gas ˇCerenkov and the pion
rejector yielded particle identiﬁcation (PID) capabilities.
The layout of the spectrometer is shown in Fig. 6.

FIG. 6. (Color online) The layout of the Left High-Resolution
Spectrometer in Hall A of Jeﬀerson Lab during E06-014.
Drawing not to scale.

The VDCs allowed precise reconstruction of particle
trajectories. Each chamber had two wire planes contain-
ing 368 sense wires, spaced 4.24 mm apart [63]; the wires
were oriented orthogonally with respect to one another.
The two wire planes lay in the horizontal plane of the
laboratory, thus oriented at 45◦ with respect to the cen-
tral (scattered) particle trajectory. Gold-plated Mylar
high-voltage planes were placed above and below each
wire plane at an operating voltage of -4 kV, thus setting
up an electric ﬁeld between the high-voltage planes. This
deﬁned a “sense region” for each wire plane. The cham-
bers were ﬁlled with a mixture of 62% argon and 38%
ethane by weight. Traversing particles ionized the gas
mixture; the ionization electrons drifted along the ﬁeld
lines to the closest sense wires, triggering a “hit” signal
in the wires. A central track passing through at an angle
of 45◦ ﬁred ﬁve sense wires on average, resulting in a po-

sitional resolution of ∼ 100 µm and an angular resolution
of ∼ 0.5 mrad [63].
The gas ˇCerenkov had ten spherical mirrors, each
with a focal length of 80 cm, stacked in two columns of
ﬁve. Each mirror was viewed by a photomultiplier tube
(PMT), placed 45 cm from the mirror. The chamber was
ﬁlled with CO2 gas at STP with an index of refraction
of 1.00043 [75]. This yielded a momentum threshold for
triggering the gas ˇCerenkov of ∼ 17 MeV for electrons
and ∼ 4.8 GeV for pions.
Incident particles were also identiﬁed using their en-
ergy deposits in the lead glass shower calorimeter, called
a pion rejector. It was composed of two layers of thirty-
four lead-glass blocks, the ﬁrst 14.5 cm × 14.5 cm ×
30 cm, the second 14.5 cm × 14.5 cm × 35 cm made
of the material SF-5, which has a radiation length of
2.55 cm [76]. The blocks were stacked so that the long
dimensions of the blocks were transverse with respect
to the direction of the scattered particle from the tar-
get. The gaps between the blocks in the ﬁrst layer were
compensated for by a slight oﬀset in the second layer of
blocks.

Since electrons and heavier particles like pions have
diﬀerent energy deposition distributions in electromag-
netic calorimeters, we can distinguish between the two
particle distributions, where electrons tend to leave most
(if not all) of their energy in the calorimeter, while pi-
ons act like minimum ionizing particles (MIPs), leaving
only a small amount of energy in the calorimeter. The
energy loss of a MIP can be approximated by 1.5 MeV
per g/cm2 traversed [77]. With the density of SF-5 be-
ing ∼ 4 g/cm3 [75], pions deposited ∼ 175 MeV in the
calorimeter (both layers of the pion rejector taken to-
gether). As a result there are two distinct peaks in the
energy distribution with good separation in the calorime-
ter: one due to pions and the other due to electrons. This
allows the selection of electrons in the analysis while re-
jecting pions.

Figure 7 shows a typical signal distribution in the gas
ˇCerenkov. Electron (pion) candidates are indicated by
the distributions centered at ∼ 6.5 photo-electrons (. 2
photo-electron) in Fig. 7, that are obtained by placing
cuts on the pion rejector signals. While scattered elec-
trons yielded an ADC signal corresponding to the main
photo-electron peak in the gas ˇCerenkov, pions may also
inﬂuence the ADC spectrum. This occurs because pions
could have ionized the atoms of the gaseous medium in
the ˇCerenkov, producing electrons with enough energy
to trigger the detector. Such electrons are called δ-rays,
or knock-on electrons. The distribution of these electrons
has a peak at the one-photo-electron peak (leftmost peak
in Fig. 7) with a long tail underneath the multiple (main)
photo-electron peak. These knock-on electrons can ef-
fectively be removed in the analysis because on average
they deposited less energy in the pion rejector. To iden-
tify electrons the ratio E/p of the energy deposited in
the pion rejector and the reconstructed momentum was
required to be greater than 0.54, as illustrated in Fig. 8

11

(Section II G). Additionally, events that deposited less
than 200 MeV in the ﬁrst layer of the pion rejector were
removed from the analysis, as they were likely to be pions
or knock-on electrons.

FIG. 7.

LHRS gas ˇCerenkov (black curve). Electron (pion) candidates
were selected by placing cuts on the energy deposited in the
pion rejector, described by E/p > 0.54 (E/p < 0.54) and for
the energy deposited in the ﬁrst layer of the pion rejector to
be greater than (less than) 200 MeV. Electrons are indicated
by the distribution centered at ∼ 6.5 photo-electrons, while
pion candidates have their distribution peaked at ∼ 1 photo-
electron.

electrons.

There were two planes of plastic scintillating material,
labeled S1 and S2m. S1 was composed of six horizontal

scintillating paddles with 36 cm × 29.3 cm × 0.5 cm ac-
tive area. Each paddle was viewed by a 5.1 cm-diameter
photomultiplier tube (PMT) on each end. The paddles
overlapped by 10 mm, oriented at a small angle with
the S1 plane. The S2m plane consisted of sixteen non-
overlapping paddles with dimensions of 43.2 cm × 14 cm
× 5.1 cm. The timing resolution of the PMTs used for
each plane was ∼ 50 ps [78].
When a paddle absorbed ionizing radiation, it emitted
light which traveled down the length of the paddle and is
collected by the PMTs attached at each end. The timing
information encoded in the PMTs’ TDCs is utilized in
the formation of the LHRS main trigger, discussed in
Section II F.

2. The BigBite Spectrometer

The BigBite spectrometer is a large-acceptance spec-
trometer, able to detect particles over a wide range in
scattering angle and momentum. BigBite consists of
one large dipole magnet, producing a maximum mag-
netic ﬁeld of ∼ 1.2 T. Charged particles with momenta of
∼ 0.5 GeV entering the magnet near its optical axis are
deﬂected roughly 25◦ for a total trajectory of 64 cm and
a ﬁeld of 0.92 T [79]. The magnet entrance was located
1.5 m from the target center, resulting in an angular ac-
ceptance of about 64 msr. The momentum range covered
by the spectrometer at full ﬁeld had a lower bound of
roughly 0.6 GeV. In its standard conﬁguration, the mag-
net bent negatively charged particles upwards into the
detector stack, while positively charged particles were
deﬂected downwards. The large acceptance of the spec-
trometer allowed the detection of both negatively and
positively charged particles. The detector stack for E06-
014 included multi-wire drift chambers for particle track-
ing, a newly installed gas ˇCerenkov, a scintillator plane
and an electromagnetic calorimeter, composed of a pre-
shower and shower calorimeter. The gas ˇCerenkov, scin-
tillator plane and the pre-shower and shower calorime-
ters were used for PID purposes. The schematic layout
of BigBite is shown in Fig. 9.

The Multi-Wire Drift Chambers (MWDCs) were uti-
lized for particle tracking, in much the same way as de-
scribed for the VDC planes in the LHRS. There were
three chambers, each ﬁlled with a 50–50 mixture of argon
and ethane gas. Each chamber had three pairs of wire
planes, giving a total of eighteen planes in all. Each of
the eighteen planes was perpendicular to the detector’s
central ray (Fig. 9), bounded by cathode planes 6 mm
apart from one another. Halfway between the cathode
planes was a plane of wires, composed of alternating ﬁeld
and sense wires. The ﬁeld wires and the cathode planes
were held at the same constant high voltage, producing
a nearly symmetric potential in the region close to the
sense wires. Each pair of wire planes had a diﬀerent ori-
entation so as to optimize track reconstruction in three
dimensions. The two so-called X-planes (X, X’) ran hor-

izontally (in detector coordinates), while the U and V
planes were oriented at +30◦ and -30◦ with respect to
the X-planes, respectively. The wires in each plane were
1 cm apart and the primed planes (X’, U’, V’) were oﬀ-
set from their unprimed counterparts by 0.5 cm. This
allowed the tracking algorithm to determine if the track
passed above or below a given wire in the X plane based
upon which wire registered a hit in the X’ plane, for ex-
ample. This alignment resulted in a positional resolution
of less than 300 µm [60].

The gas ˇCerenkov, which was constructed by Tem-
ple University speciﬁcally for this experiment [80], in-
cluded twenty spherical mirrors, each with a focal length
of 58 cm, stacked in two columns of ten. The chamber
was ﬁlled with the gas C4F8O, which has an average
index of refraction of 1.00135 [60]. ˇCerenkov light in-
cident on each mirror was reﬂected onto a correspond-
ing secondary ﬂat mirror. This mirror then directed the
ˇCerenkov light onto the face of a corresponding PMT. To
boost the amount of light collected, each PMT was ﬁtted
with a cone similar to a Winston cone [81]. This extended
the eﬀective diameter of each PMT collection area from
ﬁve inches to eight inches. The PMTs were recessed 5 ”
within their shielding in order to reduce the eﬀects of the
BigBite magnetic ﬁeld. The resulting gap between the
PMT face and the edge of the shielding was ﬁlled with a
cylindrical lining of Anomet UVS reﬂective material, so
as to direct light incident upon this region onto the PMT
face. Figure 10 shows a typical signal distribution in the
gas ˇCerenkov. Electron (pion) events are indicated by
the right (left) distributions. Electron events for a given
PMT were identiﬁed by selecting those events that had
a hit in their corresponding TDC with a projected track
from the target that fell within the PMT’s geometrical
acceptance.

The calorimeter was composed of two layers of lead-

13

LHRS and the BigBite detector systems were run inde-
pendently with a total of 5 TB of data recorded.

Eight triggers were conﬁgured for E06-014, summa-
rized in Table III. The T8 trigger was used for trou-
bleshooting purposes only.
It was a 1024 Hz clock, in-
jected into the data stream to ensure that the electronics
were working correctly. The T5 trigger was the coinci-
dence (coin.)
trigger between the LHRS and BigBite,
used for optics calibration purposes.

The generation of the main LHRS trigger (T3) required
a hit in both scintillating planes S1 and S2m, where a
hit in a single plane corresponded to a signal in the two
PMTs aﬃxed to a paddle (left and right sides) in a plane.
Thus, a T3 trigger corresponded to a pulse detected in
four PMTs, two in the S1 plane and two in the S2m
plane. The timing of this trigger was set by the leading
edge of the TDC signal recorded in the PMT attached to
the right side of the S2m scintillator paddles [64]. The
second LHRS trigger was the T4 trigger. The only diﬀer-
ence between the T3 and T4 triggers was that a T4 was
generated when there was a coincidence between either
S1 or S2m and the gas ˇCerenkov detector, without gen-
erating a T3 trigger. The T4 trigger was used to study
the eﬃciency of the T3 trigger, as these events were po-
tentially good events since they generated a signal in the
gas ˇCerenkov. It was found that the eﬃciency of the T3
trigger was 99.95% over the course of the experiment [84].
The BigBite spectrometer had four dedicated triggers,
T1, T2, T6, and T7. The T1 and T6 triggers involved
taking the hardware (voltage) sum of the calorimeter
blocks belonging to the cluster with the largest signal,
where a cluster for the pre-shower and shower calorime-
ters was deﬁned as two adjacent rows of calorimeter
blocks. There are 26 clusters each for the pre-shower
and shower calorimeters. The sum of the pre-shower and
shower signals was then formed and sent to a discrim-
inator. If this signal was greater than ∼ 300–400 MeV
(∼ 500–600 MeV), then the T1 (T6) trigger was formed.
The T7 trigger was formed in a manner similar to the T1
and T6 triggers, but using the ˇCerenkov detector instead
of the pre-shower or shower calorimeter. The ˇCerenkov
signals from two adjacent rows of mirrors (four mirrors in
total) were summed, resulting in nine overlapping mirror
clusters.
If this sum was larger than the set threshold
value (> 1–1.5 photo-electrons), then the T7 trigger was

glass blocks. The ﬁrst layer was the pre-shower, com-
posed of the material TF-5, which has a radiation length
of 2.74 cm. The pre-shower was located 85 cm from the
ﬁrst drift chamber plane. It contained 54 blocks of di-
mensions 35 cm × 8.5 cm × 8.5 cm. They were organized
in two columns of 27 rows. The long dimension of each
block was oriented transverse with respect to scattered
particles coming from the target. The shower layer was
composed of the material TF-2, which has a radiation
length of 3.67 cm and was located 15 cm behind the pre-
shower and 1 m from the ﬁrst drift chamber. It had 189
blocks of the same dimensions as the blocks in the pre-
shower, but they were organized in seven columns and
27 rows. The long dimension of the block was oriented
along the scattered particle path, ensuring the capture
of a large amount of the electromagnetic shower of the
particle [82].

The plane located between the pre-shower and the
shower consisted of a scintillator plane composed of 13
paddles of plastic scintillator, each of which had a PMT
at each end with a timing resolution of 0.3 ns. Each
paddle had the dimensions 17 cm × 64 cm × 4 cm. The
ﬁrst dimension was transverse with respect to the scat-
tered particles, while the short dimension was along the
scattered particle path. This resulted in an active area
of 221 cm × 64 cm. This plane provided an additional
source of pion rejection to complement the gas ˇCerenkov
and the shower calorimeter, as the charged pions left a
signiﬁcant signal in the low end of the ADC spectrum via
knock-on electrons [60].

F. Data acquisition and data processing

In this experiment, the CEBAF Online Data Acquisi-
tion (CODA) [83] system was used to process the various
trigger signals and data coming from the LHRS and Big-
Bite spectrometers, beamline and target equipment. The

formed. The main trigger for the BigBite spectrome-
ter, T2, imposed a geometric constraint on the incident
particle track by requiring a coincidence between the ge-
ometrically overlapping regions in the gas ˇCerenkov and
the calorimeter. An example of an event that generated
a T2 trigger is illustrated in Fig. 11: a particle that trig-
gered cluster C1 in the gas ˇCerenkov would also have to
trigger at least one of the clusters A–D in the calorime-
ter. Similar coincidences were imposed for the eight other
groupings that could form a T2 trigger.

classes have been written to interpret the data recorded
by the various detectors and their sub-detectors. For in-
stance, there are classes that convert the ADC signals
registered in a calorimeter block into the corresponding
amount of energy deposited. There are also classes that
handle the computation of a particle’s path (or track)
through the LHRS (and BigBite) up to its focal plane
and its reconstructed vertex position back at the target.
The optics for BigBite required special attention, as dis-
cussed in [60, 62, 78].

G. Particle identiﬁcation

The LHRS and the BigBite spectrometers each utilized
a gas ˇCerenkov detector and a double-layered lead-glass
shower calorimeter for PID purposes. In this experiment,
PID corresponds to distinguishing electrons from pions,
that constituted the primary background.

The PID performance of each detector was character-
ized by the eﬃciencies of the conditions (or cuts) placed
on the corresponding observable. Before PID cut eﬃ-
ciencies were evaluated, the sample distribution of events
to be studied was selected using data quality criteria
(such as removing beam trips) and conditions to remove
events that may have originated in the target’s glass end-
caps [60, 84]. The electron cut eﬃciency εe is deﬁned as
the ratio of the number of events that pass a given cut to
the size of the electron event sample deﬁned by another
detector. For the gas ˇCerenkov, the electron sample was
chosen by using the calorimeter, and vice-versa. To char-
acterize how well a given detector can reject pions, the
rejection factor fπ,rej is evaluated.
It is deﬁned as the
ratio of the size of the selected pion sample to the num-
ber of events misidentiﬁed as electrons for a given cut.
The PID cuts were chosen such that the pion rejection
was maximized while the highest electron eﬃciency was
maintained.

In the momentum acceptance range of the experiment,
0.6 GeV ≤ p ≤ 1.7 GeV, the electron cut eﬃciency for
the LHRS gas ˇCerenkov was found to be εcer
e ≈ 96% for
a cut of greater than two photoelectrons in the ADC.
For the LHRS pion rejector, εpr
e ≈ 99% for E/p > 0.54.
These eﬃciencies are critical for the LHRS data since
they contribute directly in the determination of the un-
polarized cross section (Section IV B). The pion rejection
factor was found to be ∼ 660 for both the gas ˇCerenkov
and pion rejector, resulting in a combined rejection of
fπ,rej ≈ 4× 105 [84]. As a result, the pion contamination
in the ﬁnal electron sample was negligible.
PID studies were also conducted for the data recorded
by BigBite. Here, the pion rejection factor was deter-
mined to be better than 2× 104 when combining the pion
rejection capabilities of the gas ˇCerenkov [87], pre-shower
and shower calorimeters, and the scintillator plane [60].
Unlike the cross section analysis using the LHRS data,
the electron cut eﬃciencies do not play a role in the asym-
metry extraction that is performed using the BigBite

data; the eﬃciencies cancel in the asymmetry deﬁntion
(Section IV C).

III. POLARIZED 3HE TARGET

Since the lifetime of the neutron is less than 15 min-
utes [88] outside the nucleus, a free-neutron target is not
practical. 3He, a spin-1/2 nucleus consisting of two pro-
tons and a neutron, is a candidate for a polarized neu-
tron target. Deuterium, a spin-1 nucleus consisting of a
proton and a neutron, is another option. Both nucleons
in deuterium have their spins aligned with the nuclear
spin. However, large corrections due to the proton re-
sult in large uncertainties when using a deuterium target.
When 3He is polarized, there are three principal states
in play: ∼ 90% of the time the nucleus is in the sym-
metric S state; ∼ 1.5% of the time the nucleus is in the
S′ state, and ∼ 8% of the time the nucleus is in the D
state, see Fig. 12. In the S state, the spins of the protons
are antiparallel to one another, resulting in the neutron
carrying the majority of the 3He polarization [58]. As a
result, a polarized 3He target can be used as an eﬀective
polarized neutron target.

15

hyperﬁne interaction, where the nuclear spin of 3He takes
part in the process [92]. The use of 39K greatly decreases
the spin-relaxation rate for collisions involving 3He, re-
sulting in an increase in the spin-exchange eﬃciency of
the polarization process [93].

As the atomic electrons decayed to the ground state,
photons were emitted. These photons were typically
unpolarized, and therefore reduced the eﬃciency of the
pumping process. To minimize this eﬀect for the alkali
atoms, a small amount of N2 buﬀer gas was added to the
cell. The excitation energy of the alkali atoms was passed
to the rotational and vibrational modes of the buﬀer gas
via collisions, reducing the emission of photons [90].

A. Setup

The target apparatus was composed of a number of
diﬀerent elements: the target cells, target oven, target
ladder system, Helmholtz coils for the holding magnetic
ﬁeld, RF coils and polarizing lasers. The layout of the
target system is shown in Fig. 13. The outer circle
and large straight lines intersecting at right angles in-
scribed in the large circle represent Helmholtz coils. The
smaller vertical straight lines and circle overlapping with
the Helmholtz coils signify the RF coils. Pickup coils
mounted near the target cell are also shown.

FIG. 12. 3He ground states. The dominant state is the S
state, where ∼ 90% of the polarization is carried by the neu-
tron. In this state, the protons pair to s = 0.

In this experiment, polarized 3He (cid:16)3 ~He(cid:17) was used to

study the electromagnetic structure and the spin struc-
ture of the neutron. Two major methods exist to polarize
3He nuclei. The ﬁrst one uses the metastable-exchange
optical pumping technique [89], while the second method
utilizes both spin-exchange [90] and optical pumping [91],
dubbed hybrid spin-exchange optical pumping.

39K atoms were optically pumped using 795-nm cir-
cularly polarized laser light, inducing the D1 transition
in 85Rb: 52S1/2 (m = −1/2) → 52P1/2 (m = +1/2),
in accordance with the selection rule of ∆L = +1. The
excited 85Rb electrons decay from the p orbital to the s
orbital with equal probabilities for the m = ±1/2 sub-
states, but the excitation only occurs for the m = −1/2
initial state of the s orbital; this results in the selective
population of the m = 1/2 state of the s orbital. Second,
the polarization of the 85Rb atoms was transferred to the
39K atoms via spin-exchange binary collisions [90]. In the
third and ﬁnal step, the polarization of the 85Rb and 39K
atomic electrons was transferred to the 3He nuclei via the

FIG. 13.
(Color online) The target setup. The Helmholtz
coils for the holding magnetic ﬁeld and coils for the RF ﬁeld
are shown. The pickup coils near the target cell are used for
NMR measurements. Figure reproduced from [63].

Two pairs of Helmholtz coils, capable of producing
magnetic ﬁelds in two orthogonal directions, were uti-
lized in E06-014: longitudinal (along the direction of the
beam), and transverse in-plane (perpendicular and hor-
izontal to the beam). The ﬁeld reached a magnitude of
25 G, requiring ∼ 7 A of current in each coil. The RF
coils and pickup coils are important for the measurement
of the target polarization, as presented in Sections III D
and III E.

B. Target cells

The production target cell, named Samantha, is shown
schematically in Fig. 14. The upper chamber, called
the pumping chamber, contained 3He, 85Rb, 39K and
N2, and was heated to ∼ 265◦C in order to keep the
Rb and K in a gaseous state. The polarization process
took place in this chamber. The polarized 3He gas (with
the N2 mixture) ﬂowed through a thin transfer tube to
the target chamber, thanks to the temperature gradient
between the pumping chamber and the target cell that
was kept at room temperature. This chamber was 40 cm
long and contained ∼ 8 atm of 3He and ∼ 0.13 atm of
N2 during the experiment. The temperature of the cell
was monitored via resistive temperature devices (RTDs),
which were placed equidistant from one another along the
length of the target chamber, along with two more placed
on the pumping chamber; one at the top and the other
at the base. The production cell was made out of alu-
minoscilicate glass (GE-180), which was ﬁlled and char-
acterized at the University of Virgina and the College of
William and Mary [64]. This characterization consisted
of measuring the polarization, gas density, glass thickness
of the cell and rate of polarization.

FIG. 14. The production target cell used in our experiment.
The top spherical chamber is the pumping chamber where the
polarization of 3He takes place. The long cylindrical chamber
is the target cell, through which the electron beam passes
longitudinally. The thin tube connecting these two chambers
is the transfer tube, which allows polarized 3He to drift down
into the target chamber. Drawing not to scale.

An additional reference cell was used [94], which could
be ﬁlled with H2, N2 or 3He. This allowed the determi-
nation of the dilution factors that contribute to the cross
sections and asymmetries. RTDs were also mounted on
the reference cell to monitor its temperature, in a similar
conﬁguration as was done for the target cell. A multi-
carbon foil (“optics”) target—as well as the reference cell
ﬁlled with hydrogen gas—was used for the calibration of
the optics for the two spectrometers. All of these tar-
gets were mounted on a target ladder, which could be
moved vertically up and down to select the target needed.
In addition to these targets, a “no target” position was
available, corresponding to a hole in the target ladder.

It was used during Møller polarimeter measurements, so
that the target assembly would not be damaged in the
process.

C. Laser system

Our experiment utilized an upgraded laser system that
had been installed for the immediately preceding exper-
iment, E06-010 [74]. These new COMET lasers had a
linewidth of 0.2 nm, a factor of ten less than that of
their predecessors (FAP lasers [95–97]). This dramat-
ically improved the optical pumping eﬃciency, since a
narrower linewidth results in proportionately more pho-
tons exciting the desired atomic transitions in 85Rb, so
that a higher polarization of 3He atoms could be attained
in a shorter timeframe [98].

The laser setup is shown in Fig. 15.

It consisted of
three COMET lasers, each with a power of 25 W and a
wavelength of 795 nm, used to optically pump the 85Rb
in the pumping chamber. The lasers were installed in a
separate laser building behind the counting house on the
accelerator site at JLab. The ﬁber coming out of each
COMET control unit was connected to a 75-m-long ﬁber
that ran from the laser building to the hall. Then the
ﬁber was connected to a 5-to-1 combiner. The output
of the combiner was sent to a beamsplitter, yielding two
linearly polarized components. One component passed
twice through a quarter-wave plate, after which both had
the same linear polarization. Sending each component
through another quarter wave plate converted the lin-
ear polarization into circular polarization. The resulting
beams were then combined into one, with a spot size of
7.5 cm in diameter, the size of the pumping chamber [98].
There were three optics lines corresponding to the lon-
gitudinal, transverse and vertical polarization directions.
The polarizing optics were set up in an antiparallel pump-
ing conﬁguration such that the target spin was always
oriented opposite to the magnetic holding ﬁeld [60].

D. EPR measurements

The target polarization was measured in an absolute
sense through an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
measurement, that utilized Zeeman splitting of the elec-
tron energy levels when an atom was placed in an exter-
nal magnetic ﬁeld. This phenomenon occurred for the
85Rb and 39K atoms, which were present in the pump-
ing chamber. The ground states of the alkali metals split
into 2F + 1 energy levels, where F is the total angular
momentum quantum number. Speciﬁcally, for 85Rb, the
F = 3 ground state split into seven sublevels correspond-
ing to mF = −3,. . . , 3. For 39K, the F = 2 ground
state split into ﬁve energy levels, given by mF = −2,. . . ,
2. The splitting corresponded to a frequency that is pro-
portional to the holding ﬁeld. This frequency was shifted
due to the small eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld created by the

ment was ∼ 4%, dominated by the uncertainties on the
dimensionless constant κ0 [104] and the number density
of the gas in the pumping chamber [60].

17

E. NMR measurements

Another method we used for measuring the polariza-
tion of the 3He nuclei was measuring the 3He nuclear
magnetic resonance signal. The magnetic moments of
3He nuclei aligned along the direction of an external mag-
netic holding ﬁeld had their direction reversed by apply-
ing an RF ﬁeld in the perpendicular direction. Sweeping
the frequency of the RF ﬁeld through the resonance of
the 3He nucleus ﬂipped the spins of the nuclei. This
spin ﬂip changed the ﬁeld ﬂux through the pick-up coils
(Fig. 13), inducing an electromotive force. The signals
from the coils were pre-ampliﬁed and combined, and sent
to a lock-in ampliﬁer. The magnitude of the ﬁnal signal
was proportional to the 3He polarization.

The RF is swept according to the Adiabatic Fast Pas-
sage (AFP) technique [105], in which the sweep through
the resonant frequency is done faster than the spin-
relaxation time, but slowly enough so that the nuclear
spins can follow the sweep of the RF ﬁeld. This mini-
mizes the eﬀect of these NMR measurements on the tar-
get polarization.

An NMR measurement is a relative measurement, so it
needs to be compared against a known reference. A mea-
surement of NMR on water is typically used, for which
the polarization can be calculated exactly from statis-
tical mechanics [106]. However, in E06-014, water-cell
measurements were available only for the longitudinal
target polarization conﬁguration, as conversion factors
needed to account for the diﬀerent positions of the water
and 3He cells could not be measured for the transverse
conﬁguration [60]. Because of this, the NMR measure-
ments were calibrated against EPR measurements (Sec-
tion III D) that were done close in time relative to the
NMR measurements. The NMR water measurements
in the longitudinal conﬁguration were used as a cross-
check against the EPR measurements, and were found
to be consistent to the 1% level. NMR measurements
were performed every four hours on the production 3He
target. The systematic error on the NMR measurement
was ∼ 3.9% (relative), dominated by the uncertainties on
the EPR calibration and on the computed magnetic ﬂux
through the pickup coils [60].

F. Target performance

The target polarization over the course of the exper-
iment, extracted from NMR measurements, is shown in
Fig. 16.
In the data analysis (Section IV C), the tar-
get polarization data was utilized on a run-by-run basis.
On average, the target polarization achieved was 50.5%
with a relative uncertainty of 7.2% (3.6% absolute). The

spin-exchange mechanism of 85Rb–39K and 39K–3He, in
addition to the polarization of the 3He nuclei.

When the EPR transition was excited, an alkali metal
(either Rb or K as chosen by the excitation frequency)
lost its polarization. When one of the metals was depo-
larized, so was the other due to the fast spin-exchange
mechanism. Upon re-polarization of the Rb atoms, there
was an increase in the photons emitted corresponding
to the P1/2 → S1/2 (D1) transition (795 nm). However,
due to thermal mixing between the P1/2 and P3/2 energy
states and occasional collisional mixing with N2 in the
cell, the P3/2 → S1/2 (D2) transition (780 nm) was pos-
sible. While the amount of D1 and D2 ﬂourescence was
roughly the same [98], the D1 light was suppressed due to
a large background component corresponding to the po-
larizing laser light. Therefore, a ﬁlter was attached to a
photodiode to identify the D2 light. During the measure-
ment, the RF was modulated with a 100 Hz sine wave,
and the D2 transition was synchronized to this modu-
lating signal and measured by a lock-in ampliﬁer. The
signal from the lock-in output was proportional to the
derivative of the EPR ﬂuorescence curve as a function
of the RF; the EPR resonance occured when the deriva-
tive was equal to zero [98, 99]. EPR measurements were
performed every few days.

To determine the polarization in the target chamber, a
model [100–103] was used to describe the diﬀusion of the
3He polarization from the pumping chamber to the target
chamber. The relative systematic error of the measure-

dominant contribution to the uncertainty was from the
calibration of the NMR measurements against the EPR
measurements (3.9% relative) and the loss of polarization
due to the diﬀusion of polarized 3He from the pumping
chamber to the target chamber (6% relative).

IV. DATA ANALYSIS

A. Analysis procedure

The analysis procedure is outlined in Fig. 17, which
shows that the raw data were ﬁrst replayed, followed by
the calibration and data quality checks. Data calibra-
tions included gain-matching ADC readings within the
gas ˇCerenkov and shower calorimeters to have the same
responses for a given type of signal. Calibrations also
involved optimizing the software packages that describes
the optics of the two spectrometers. Multi-foil carbon
targets, a sieve slit collimator and elastic 1H(e, e′)p data
at an incident energy of E = 1.23 GeV were used to cali-
brate the optics software package for the LHRS [74] and
for the BigBite spectrometer. The momentum resolution
achieved for the BigBite spectrometer was ∼ 1% [60].
Data quality checks implied checking the calibration re-
sults and removing beam trips from the data. Faulty
runs (e.g., those having poor beam quality, detector live-
times . 80%, run times less than a few minutes, etc.)
were also identiﬁed and discarded from the analysis.

Following calibration and data quality checks, the elec-
tron sample was cleaned up by removing events that did
not generate a good trigger or had poor track recon-
struction. Cuts were also made to remove pion tracks
and events originating in the target window. In the Big-
Bite data set, geometrical cuts had to be implemented
to remove events that rescattered from the BigBite mag-
net pole pieces. After all cuts had been applied to the
data, the raw physics observables consisting of cross sec-
tions and asymmetries were then extracted. Corrections

were applied to account for the nitrogen target con-
tamination and background due to pair-produced elec-
trons, neither of which could be removed by cuts. Af-
ter these corrections were applied, we obtained the ex-
perimental cross sections (Section IV B) and the exper-
imental asymmetries (Section IV C). Applying radiative
corrections yielded the ﬁnal quantities for each of those,
from which the spin structure functions g1 and g2 on
3He were extracted as described in Appendix A 6. The
3He results for the unpolarized cross sections, double-spin
asymmetries and spin structure functions g1 and g2 are

B. Cross sections

1. Extraction of raw cross sections from data

The unpolarized diﬀerential cross section was calcu-

lated from the data for a given run as follows:

d3σraw
dΩdE′ =

tpsNcut

1

(Q/e)ntLT ε

∆E′∆Ω∆Z

,

(28)

where tps denotes the prescale value for the T3 trig-
ger [107], Ncut the number of electrons that pass all
cuts, Q/e the number of beam electrons delivered to the
target, n the target number density in amagats [108],
tLT the live-time [109], and ε the product of all detec-
tor (cut) eﬃciencies. The quantity ∆E′ = δp/p0 · p0,
where δp/p0 = (p− p0)/p0 is the scattered momentum of
the electron p relative to the LHRS momentum setting
p0. Electrons were selected according to the criterion
|δp/p0| < 3.5%, which was based on the agreement of the
Monte Carlo simulation of the spectrometer (see below)
with the data [84]. The quantity ∆Z denotes the eﬀec-
tive target length seen by the spectrometer, measured in
meters. The cut on the eﬀective target length was cho-
sen such that the target windows and edge eﬀects due to
scattering from the magnets in the LHRS are removed.
The term ∆Ω denotes the solid-angle acceptance, mea-
sured in steradians; it is deﬁned as the product of the
in-plane scattering angle ∆θ and out-of-plane scattering
angle ∆φ. The cut chosen for ∆θ (∆φ) was ±40 mrad
(±20 mrad), which amounts to a solid angle of 3.2 msr.
The cuts on δp/p0, ∆Z, ∆θ and ∆φ were informed by
looking at a Monte Carlo simulation of the LHRS.

The eﬀective acceptance was determined with the
Single-Arm Monte Carlo (SAMC) simulation [110]. To
determine how the geometrical acceptance of the LHRS
deviates from the ideal rectangular acceptance, SAMC
began by generating events originating from the tar-
get that were uniformly distributed over the kinemati-
cal phase space. Each event was then transported to the
focal plane using an optical model of the LHRS [111].
As the particle encountered each magnet aperture in
the LHRS, a check was performed to see if it success-
fully passed through the known apertures.
If the sim-
ulated particle successfully made it through all geo-
metrical apertures, it was then reconstructed back to
the target using the optics matrix optimized during
the experiment. The ratio r of the number of recon-
structed events to the number of generated events was
used to determine the eﬀective acceptance, written as
r = ∆E′∆Ω∆Z/∆E′
MC∆ΩMC∆ZMC. The subscript MC
refers to the initially generated kinematic phase space in
the simulation, chosen to be larger than the apertures of
the LHRS, so as to avoid edge eﬀects.

The cross sections extracted for each run of a given
momentum bin were then averaged, weighted by their
statistical errors:

2. Background corrections

The raw 3He cross section measured in the LHRS, σraw,
contains contributions from electrons that were not scat-
tered from 3He, but were produced in processes corre-
sponding to electron-positron (pair) production (arising
from π0 mesons decaying predominantly to photons), or
scattering from nitrogen nuclei.

To remove the pair-production contributions from
σraw, several runs were taken with the LHRS in positive
polarity mode (i.e., detecting positrons) to measure the
positron cross section, σe+
. The nitrogen electron cross
section σe−
N2 was measured by ﬁlling the additional refer-
ence target cell (Section III B) with nitrogen gas and ex-
posing it to the beam. Pair production also occurs when
scattering from nitrogen nuclei, so a nitrogen positron
cross section, σe+
N2, was also measured with the LHRS in
positive polarity mode. The positron cross section on

counting the pair-produced events in the measurement

one has to consider pion background contributions; how-
ever, given the high pion suppression in the LHRS (Sec-
tion II G), this component was found to be negligible.

where nN2 is the number density of nitrogen in the pro-
duction cell and n3He is the number density of 3He in the
production cell.

When the nitrogen reference cell was in the beam, the
number density for the cell was extracted using the mea-
sured temperature and pressure of the cell. This number
density was used when extracting a nitrogen cross sec-
tion (Eq. 28). A systematic uncertainty of 2.2% was esti-
mated by computing the number densities while varying
the temperature and pressure by up to 2◦ C and 2 psig,
respectively [60]. In the 3He production cell, the num-
ber density of nitrogen nN2 was taken to be 0.113 amg
(Eq. 31). This value was recorded as the target was ini-
tially ﬁlled, and is accurate to 3% from a pressure curve
analysis.

Due to time constraints and hardware problems en-
countered during the experiment, there were not enough
data to map out the background contributions to the
raw cross section for all kinematic bins. To resolve this
issue, empirical ﬁts to the positron and nitrogen data
(see Appendix C 1) were used to subtract those contri-
butions. Figures 18 and 19 show the raw electron cross
section, the positron and nitrogen cross sections (scaled
by the ratio of the nitrogen number density to that of
3He in the production target cell), and the background-
subtracted electron cross section, σexp. The error bars
on the data points represent the statistical uncertainties.
The largest correction was due to the positrons, at ∼ 53%
in the lowest x bin, and fell to a few percent for x & 0.5.

3. Radiative corrections

A ﬁrst correction that must be done before carrying
out the radiative corrections is to subtract the elastic
and quasi-elastic radiative tails, since they are long and
aﬀect all states of higher invariant mass W [112]. For
these kinematics, the elastic tail was small and aﬀects
the lowest bins in scattered electron energy E′ at the .
1% level only. The elastic tail was computed following the
exact formalism given by Mo and Tsai [112], and using
elastic 3He form factors from Amroun [113]. The 3He
quasi-elastic tail, however, was much larger, at ∼ 25–30%
in the lowest x bin. The quasi-elastic radiative tail was

data sets is the same as in Fig. 18.

computed by utilizing an appropriate model of the 3He
quasi-elastic cross section [114] and applying radiative
eﬀects [115]. The tail was then subtracted from the data.
The model was checked against existing quasi-elastic 3He
data [116–118] covering a broad range of kinematics.

After the elastic and quasi-elastic tails had been sub-
tracted from the data, radiative corrections were applied
according to [112, 119], where the internal corrections
were calculated using the equivalent radiator method and
the external corrections were performed using the energy
peaking approximation. In the experiment, we took pro-
duction data for only two beam energies of 4.74 GeV and
5.89 GeV. However, we needed enough data to properly
calculate the integrals involved in the radiative correction
procedure. Therefore, we used the F1F209 cross section
parameterization [120] to ﬁll in the rest of the phase space
for each data set. The radiative corrections were as large
as ∼ 50% in the lowest measured x bin, and fell oﬀ to a
few percent at the large x bins.

The resulting ﬁnal 3He cross sections for E = 4.74 GeV
and 5.89 GeV are presented in Fig. 20. The data are tab-
ulated in Tables IV and V. The uncertainty on the ﬁnal
cross section arising from the radiative corrections was
determined by varying the contributions to the radia-
tive correction calculations, including the radiation thick-
nesses in the incident and scattered electron path, and
considering diﬀerent models for the elastic and quasi-
elastic tail calculations. Of these, the quasi-elastic tail
gave the biggest uncertainty, ∼ 5–6% for the lowest x
bin, falling to ∼ 1% for all other bins. A full break-
down of the uncertainties on the ﬁnal results is given in
Tables XXIII and XXIV in Appendix E 1.

C. Asymmetries

1. Extraction of raw asymmetries from data

The raw double-spin asymmetries were extracted from
the data recorded in the BigBite detectors according to:

Araw

k =

Araw

⊥ =

N ↓⇑ − N ↑⇑
N ↓⇑ + N ↑⇑

1

hcos φi

N ↓⇒ − N ↑⇒
N ↓⇒ + N ↑⇒ ,

(32)

(33)

where N denotes the number of electron counts after ap-
plying data quality and PID cuts for a particular beam
and target spin conﬁguration, ↓ (↑) corresponds to the
electron’s spin polarized antiparallel (parallel) to its mo-
mentum, ⇑ indicates that the target was polarized paral-
lel to the electron momentum, and ⇒ indicates that the
target was polarized transverse to the electron momen-
tum.

In E06-014, there were three target-spin conﬁgura-
tions, either parallel (k, referred to here as longitudinal)
or transverse (⊥, in two orientations: ⇐, 90◦ and ⇒,
270◦) to the electron beam momentum. The quantity φ
is the angle between the electron scattering plane (de-
ﬁned by incident and scattered electron momenta ~k and
~k′) and the polarization plane (deﬁned by ~k and the tar-
get polarization ~S). The transverse data were normal-
ized by hcos φi, since this term is not necessarily equal to
unity. This correction was found to be very small. There
is no hφi correction for parallel asymmetry data since the
electron spin is aligned along the target spin direction.
For the spin asymmetry analysis, one needs to cor-
rectly classify the data according to the relation between
the digital helicity signal and the physical helicity of the
electrons in the beam. Møller polarimetry measurements

21

(Secton II D 2) were performed after each beam conﬁg-
uration change, to check the consistency of the electron
helicity assignment in Hall A [62]. To conﬁrm the rela-
tionship between the digital helicity signal and the physi-
cal helicity of the electrons in the beam, measurements of
the 3He longitudinal quasi-elastic asymmetry were con-
ducted at E = 1.23 GeV and θ = 45◦. The sign of the
extracted raw quasi-elastic asymmetry was veriﬁed to be
consistent with our understanding of the relationship be-
tween the digital helicity signal and the physical electron
helicity.

Since there were two transverse target spin conﬁgu-
rations, care must be taken when combining the results
for the 90◦ and 270◦ since they will have opposite signs
relative to one another. To determine which target con-
ﬁguration should carry which sign, one can consider the
dot product of the scattered electron momentum vec-
tor ~k′ and the target spin vector ~S. With the target
polarized transverse to the incident electron momentum
~k, the target spin only enters the cross section through
the dot product of ~k′ and ~S [121]. Their dot product is
~k′ · ~S = E′ sin θ cos φ, where θ is the electron scattering
angle. For the transverse spin conﬁgurations, φ is nearly
0. The positive sense of the target spin is then the di-
rection that points to the side of the beamline where the
scattering electron is detected (consistent with JLab E99-
117 [27]). In this experiment, the asymmetry measure-
ment was done using BigBite; therefore, when the target
spin was pointing towards BigBite (270◦), the asymme-
try carried a positive sign. If the target spin was pointing
towards the LHRS (90◦), it carried a negative sign. Using
this convention, the results for 270◦ and 90◦ were aver-
aged together using their statistical errors as a weight.

2. Experimental asymmetries

The raw asymmetry deﬁnitions shown in Eqs. 32
and 33 do not account for dilution eﬀects due to the
presence of nitrogen in the target or the imperfect beam
and target polarizations. Therefore, the raw asymmetries
must be corrected to yield the experimental asymmetries:

Aexp

k,⊥ =

1

DN2PbPt

Araw
k,⊥,

(34)

where Pb and Pt denote the beam and target polariza-
tions, respectively (Sections II D 2 and III F) and DN2 the
nitrogen dilution factor. Experimental asymmetries for
one target-spin conﬁguration were averaged in the same
way as shown in Eq. 29, where the ith cross section σi is
replaced by the ith experimental asymmetry Aexp

.

i

The nitrogen dilution factor was determined by com-
paring the rates from the nitrogen reference cell against
those from the 3He production cell:

DN2 = 1−

Q(3He)
Q(N2)

tLT (3He)
tLT (N2)

tps(N2)
tps(3He)

ΣN2 (N2)
Σtotal(3He)

nN2(3He)
nN2 (N2)
(35)
where ΣN2 and Σtotal denote the total number of counts
that pass data quality and PID cuts detected during the
N2 and 3He production target runs, while nN2(N2) and
nN2(3He) denote the nitrogen number densities present in
the two targets. Because the nitrogen and 3He produc-
tion runs have diﬀerent characteristics (e.g., scattering
rates, running time, etc.), the measured electron counts
must be normalized by the total charge, given by Q(N2)
and Q(3He), deposited on the two targets, the trigger
prescale factors for the nitrogen and 3He runs, given as
tps(N2) and tps(3He); and ﬁnally, the live-times for the
nitrogen and 3He runs, given as tLT (N2) and tLT (3He).
The nitrogen dilution factor was extracted on a run-
by-run basis and the results were averaged, weighted by
their statistical uncertainties for a given run conﬁgu-
ration. The resulting dilution factor was applied bin-
by-bin in x, and was found to be roughly constant at
DN2 ≈ 0.920 ± 0.003 [60].

3. Background corrections

As described in Section IV B, the main sources of
background contamination were charged pions and pair-
produced electrons. To quantify the charged pion con-
tamination in the electron sample, the pion peak in
the pre-shower energy spectrum was ﬁtted with a Gaus-
sian function convoluted with a Landau function, and
the electron peak with a Gaussian function, as shown
in Fig. 21. The ratio of the pion counts to the elec-
tron counts was then evaluated from the integrals of the
two ﬁts above a threshold of 200 MeV [60]. This ratio
was evaluated for the π− (Nπ−/Ne− ) and π+ (Nπ+ /Ne+ )
mesons. The π+ ratio was evaluated after reversing the
polarity of BigBite so that particles with similar trajecto-
ries could be compared. The Nπ−/Ne− ratio was largest
in the lowest x bin of 0.277, at ∼ 2.7%, and dropped
quickly to below 1% by x = 0.425. The Nπ+/Ne+ ra-
tio was larger and consistently ∼ 6% across the whole
x range. A systematic uncertainty of 2.5% was assigned
to the Nπ/Ne ratios, the value determined in the imme-
diately preceding experiment, E06-010 [74], in which a
similar ﬁtting procedure was used and checked indepen-

trons in BigBite and pions in the LHRS. In E06-010,
it was found that these two methods were consistent to
around 2–3% [64].

A spin asymmetry in the charged-pion production will
aﬀect the measured electron asymmetries. To study this,
asymmetries in the pion sample were determined after
applying corrections for the nitrogen dilution and the
beam and target polarizations, yielding the π− and π+
experimental asymmetries. The results are shown in

was found that the π− (π+) asymmetry contribution was
less than 5% (3%) of the statistical uncertainty in the
asymmetries and therefore could be neglected.

To quantify the contamination due to pair-produced
electrons, the ratio of positrons to electrons, Ne+ /Ne−
needed to be determined. Due to time constraints this
ratio could only be measured directly at 4.74 GeV. To
determine this ratio for the 5.89 GeV run a parametriza-
tion was made of the 4.74 GeV BigBite and LHRS runs,

the 5.89 GeV LHRS run together with data at 5.7 GeV
and θ = 41.1◦ from JLab CLAS EG1b [122]. These data,
multiplied by (1/E2)(Ne+ /Ne−), were then ﬁt to an em-
pirical function f (kT ) = exp(a + b · kT ) with kT = k sin θ
being the transverse momentum. The data and the ﬁt are
shown in Fig. 24. The error on the ﬁt was propagated to
be 5–6% across the x-range of the measurements. The
lowest x bin, x = 0.23, was then excluded from further
analysis after the Ne+ /Ne− ratio was found to be in ex-
cess of 80%. At the ﬁrst bin included in the analysis,
x = 0.277, that ratio was ∼ 50% and fell to less than 10%
by x = 0.473. Beyond x = 0.5 the ratio had dropped to
below 3% [60].

Just as with the pion contamination, pair-produced
electrons can aﬀect or dilute the measured electron asym-
metry.
Ideally, the asymmetry should be measured by
reversing the polarity of BigBite so that the positrons
are detected with the same acceptance as the electrons.
However, due to the same time constraints as mentioned
previously, this could only be completed for one target-
spin orientation (270◦) at 4.74 GeV. Because of this, the
positron asymmetries were measured bent down in Big-
Bite. The asymmetries measured in this conﬁguration
were observed to be in good agreement with those when
the positrons were deﬂected upwards; however, the accep-
tance, and hence the rate, was ∼ 60% lower. Therefore,
for each beam energy and each target-spin conﬁgura-
tion a weighted average was computed over all measured
asymmetries. The results are shown in Figs 25 and 26.
The measured electron asymmetries for each beam en-
ergy and target spin-conﬁguration were then corrected
by the corresponding weighted average positron asym-
metry scaled by the Ne+ /Ne− ratio.

The eﬀects of the charged-pion and pair-produced elec-

tron asymmetries were corrected for through:

In addition to charge- and DAQ-induced false asymme-
tries, the analysis could also introduce a false asymmetry.
For example, if the data rates were high enough, it may
be more diﬃcult to reconstruct good tracks related to
the higher-rate helicity state as compared to the lower-
rate one, resulting in an asymmetry [124]. However, the
E06-014 data set was dominated by single-track events
(∼ 96%), and thus the rates were not high enough for
such an asymmetry to have a signiﬁcant impact on the
measured electron asymmetries.

Potential sources of false asymmetries are limited by
the 30 Hz helicity ﬂipping rate of the electron beam. Ad-
ditionally, any false asymmetry that does not change sign
with respect to the IHWP state (Section IV C 1), such as
those due to electronic cross-talk [125], would be can-
celed when combining data from the two IHWP states.
In summary, no signiﬁcant false asymmetries were ob-
served.

5. Radiative corrections

(37)

Radiative corrections on the asymmetries were applied
utilizing a similar approach as on the cross sections in
Section IV B 3. We carried out the corrections on polar-
ized cross section diﬀerences, ∆σ, related to asymmetries
by:

At this point, the bins for which x > 0.90 were removed
from the analysis, so as to exclude the quasi-elastic and
∆ resonance contributions.

4. False asymmetries

When measuring a scattering asymmetry, care must be
taken to ensure that the asymmetry was due to electron
spin-dependent scattering and not to helicity-correlated
changes in the electron beam, known as false asymme-
tries. One potential false asymmetry arises from a diﬀer-
ence in the electron beam intensity between the two he-
licity states, resulting in an asymmetry in the deposited
charge on the target. During the experiment, the beam
charge asymmetry was limited to ∼ 100 ppm through
the use of a feedback loop controlled by a specialized
DAQ [123] and was veriﬁed by measuring the charge
asymmetry using the Compton polarimeter [62]. Com-
pared to the size of the electron asymmetry measure-
ments, Acor, the charge asymmetry was negligible.

Helicity-dependent DAQ changes can also generate
false asymmetries, which can be observed through the
measurement of the detector’s live-time. A helicity-
dependent rate change could lead to one helicity state
having a larger live-time than the other, resulting in an
asymmetry. BigBite detector live-times were recorded for
each helicity gate for each run of the experiment. The
helicity-dependent live-time asymmetry was extracted
from the data and was found to be < 100 ppm for the
entire data set, which was negligible [60].

k (Ar

where Ar

polarized cross section is σr
0, where the r indicates that
radiative eﬀects have been applied. We used the F1F209
parameterization [120] for the unpolarized cross section.
The input used to ﬁll out the integration phase space fell
into three diﬀerent kinematic regions: the DIS region,
the quasi-elastic region, and the ∆ resonance region. For
the DIS region the DSSV [126] PDF parametrization was
used, for the quasi-elastic region Bosted’s nucleon form
factors [127], smeared by a quasi-elastic scaling func-
tion [128] was used and for the ∆ region the MAID
model [28] was used. The ∆σ obtained after putting
these models together for the three regions described the
JLab E94-010 data [129] reasonably well [84].

In the radiative correction procedure, the quasi-elastic
tail was not subtracted ﬁrst, but rather included in the
integration. The elastic tail was found to be negligible
and was not subtracted. To minimize statistical ﬂuctu-
ations in the radiative corrections, the corrections were
performed on a model of our data set. After obtaining
the ﬁnal ∆σ, the corresponding asymmetry was obtained
by inverting Eq. 38 (but using the Born σ0 from F1F209)
to ﬁnd A with the size of the radiative correction given
by:

∆A = Ab − Ar.

(39)

The quantity Ab denotes the Born asymmetry and Ar
the radiated asymmetry. Here, Ar is the model input to
the radiative corrections program. This ∆A was applied
to our extracted asymmetries, Acor
k,⊥ (see Eq. 37), as an
additive correction. The size of the radiative correction
was found to be at most on the order of 45% (10−3 level)
of the uncorrected asymmetry. The radiative corrections
in the DIS region were checked against results obtained
using the formalism of Akushevich et al. [130]. The re-
sults of both methods agreed to the 10−4 level in the
asymmetry.

The asymmetries on 3He before and after radiative
corrections for the 4.74 and 5.89 GeV runs are shown in
Figs. 27 and 28 and tabulated in Tables VI and VII in
Section V. The systematic uncertainties for the radiative
corrected data, were obtained by varying all input to rea-
sonable levels. The inputs varied included the electron
cuts, the nitrogen dilution factor, beam and target polar-
izations, pion and pair-production contamination levels
and the radiative corrections. The latter were observed to
change less than 5% when using various input models and
when the radiation thicknesses before and after scatter-
ing were varied by up to ±10%. Tables in Appendix E 2
list the various contributions to the systematic errors.

Free nucleons behave diﬀerently from those bound in
nuclei, primarily due to spin depolarization, Fermi mo-
tion, nuclear binding, and nuclear shadowing and anti-
shadowing eﬀects. Additionally, the characteristics of
bound nucleons can be altered by the presence of non-
nucleonic degrees of freedom and how far oﬀ-shell the
nucleons are.

We utilized the work of Bissey et. al. [131], which
provides a description of the g1 spin structure function
on 3He over the range 10−4 ≤ x ≤ 0.8. It models the 3He

valid if the higher-twist eﬀects are assumed to be small;

systematic uncertainty was the background subtraction,
at a relative uncertainty of ∼ 9% in the lowest bin in x.
Our extracted cross section values are in good agreement

FIG. 30. (Color online) Our results for g1 on 3He for 4.74 GeV
(ﬁlled squares) and 5.89 GeV (ﬁlled circles) data. The er-
ror bars on our data points represent the statistical uncer-
tainty. The bands at the bottom of the plot indicate the
systematic uncertainty for each data set, where the upper
(lower) band corresponds to the 4.74 GeV (5.89 GeV) data
set. The DIS data set corresponds to data for which x < 0.519
(x < 0.623) for E = 4.74 GeV (5.89 GeV); the data at larger x

pared to world DIS data from JLab E99-117 [27, 45], SLAC
E142 [42], and resonance data from JLab E01-012 [148] and
JLab E97-103 [150, 151]. The gray band represents an enve-
lope of various global analyses [126, 132–134, 149] for g1 at
Q2 = 4.43 GeV2, which was the average Q2 of our data set.

1 [42, 43, 141, 151] and x2gn

data on x2gn
2 [26, 137, 151]
was used to evaluate dn
2 . This contribution is relatively
small, considering the x2-weighting. The large-x contri-
bution comes from the elastic peak, which was modeled
using the Riordan [39] and Kelly [40] parameterizations.
The contribution from the range 0.90 < x < 0.99 was
considered to be negligible when taking into account the
size of our g1 and g2 data at x ∼ 0.90. Nuclear cor-
rections were applied to our 3He data as described in
Section IV D. Adding the low-x and high-x (elastic) con-
tributions to our measured result gave the full dn
2 inte-
gral. Target mass corrections (TMCs) were checked by
extracting dn
2 using the Nachtmann moments [154]; the
diﬀerence between the CN and Nachtmann approaches
was found to be small relative to the statistical uncer-
tainties. An overview of the systematic uncertainties is
given in Table XXXIII. The largest contribution to the
systematic uncertainty comes from the unmeasured low-
x region.

Our unpolarized cross section and double-spin asym-
metry data were obtained at various Q2 values; since
2 integral is typically carried out at constant Q2,
the dn
we considered what the eﬀect of evolving ¯gn
2 (the twist-
3 part of gn
2 value. To do this,
we utilized the ¯gn
2 model from Ref. [155] along with the
Q2 evolution description for gn
2 from Ref. [156], which
uses ﬂavor-nonsinglet evolution equations and utilizes

where Q2
0 = 3.21 GeV2 (4.32 GeV2) for E = 4.74 GeV
(5.89 GeV). The dn
2 integral was evaluated according
to Eq. 4 for our measured hxi bins corresponding to
0.277 ≤ x ≤ 0.874 (0.277 ≤ x ≤ 0.873) for E = 4.74 GeV
(5.89 GeV). We found ∆dn
2 = 0.00008 (0.00007) for the
E = 4.74 GeV (5.89 GeV), which is a factor of 6 (5)
smaller than the systematic uncertainty on our measured
dn
2 for E = 4.74 GeV (5.89 GeV). The diﬀerence between
the constant Q2 evaluation of dn
2 compared to the varying

Q2 approach was taken as an estimate of the systematic
uncertainty due to not performing the Q2 evolution on
our data.

Our result at(cid:10)Q2(cid:11) = 3.21 GeV2 is small and negative,
while the result at (cid:10)Q2(cid:11) = 4.32 GeV2 is consistent with

zero (Table X). The trend of our measurements appears
to be in agreement with the lattice QCD calculation [34]
at Q2 = 5 GeV2. Our dn
2 extraction is also consistent
with bag [32, 35, 36] and chiral soliton [31] models, as
shown in Fig. 34.

The Jeﬀerson Lab Angular Momentum (JAM) collab-
oration has published new results from their global QCD
analysis [159]. Their work utilizes an iterative Monte
Carlo technique that aims to reduce the inﬂuence of un-
physical ﬁtting parameters and to lower the impact of pa-
rameter initial values on the results. JAM has included
our data in their global analysis by ﬁtting directly our

FIG. 34. (Color online) Our measured dn
2 data as a function
of Q2 compared to the world data from SLAC E155x [26],
JLab E99-117 and SLAC E155x [27], JLab RSS [24] and JLab
E01-012 [25]. Also shown are various theoretical calculations,
including a QCD sum rule approach [29, 30], a chiral soli-
ton model [31] and a bag model [32]. Additionally, a lattice
QCD [34] calculation is shown. The elastic contribution to
dn
2 is given by the dashed curve, evaluated using the CN mo-
ments. Figure reproduced from Ref. [152].

The low-x, high-x and measured regions were treated in
the same way as was done for the d2 analysis, using the
same model inputs. Our g1 data were not evolved to
a constant Q2, as our investigation into the Q2 evolu-
tion of our g1 data revealed that the Q2 dependence was
negligible [60]. Our results for an
2 are shown in Fig. 35,
where the inner error bars are the statistical uncertain-
ties and the outer error bars represent the in-quadrature
sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties. The cir-
cle (square) data points exclude (include) the unmea-
sured low-x region. Both data points extracted are pos-
itive, and the elastic contribution is sizable. The SLAC
E143 [141] data are also plotted, where their uncertainty
is the in-quadrature sum of the statistical and system-

30

atic contributions. The up-triangles represent the aver-
age over global analyses [126, 132–134, 149]. The lat-
tice calculation shown is from G¨ockeler et al. [34], where
the error bar is statistical with a 15% systematic uncer-
tainty added in-quadrature. The systematic uncertainty
arises from their extrapolation of their result to the chiral
limit [34]. Our results are tabulated in Table XI, broken
down into the low-x, measured and high-x regions. The

3. Color force extraction

In order to decompose the Lorentz color force into its
electric and magnetic components, one needs to ﬁrst ex-
tract the twist-4 matrix element, f n
2 . This is accom-
plished by considering our measured dn
2 value along with
the an

2 matrix element.

2 matrix element was evaluated for various global
analyses [126, 132–134, 149] over the range 0.02 < x <

The an

0.90, and the average of the results at each (cid:10)Q2(cid:11)-bin is

taken as the value of an
2 . These results are consistent with
our extracted values (Fig. 35). The elastic contribution
was added to the integral in a similar fashion as was done
for dn
2 .

With dn

2 and an

2 in hand, the twist-4 matrix ele-
2 was evaluated following the analysis presented

ment f n

in [37, 160]. Results for Γn
1 (Eq. 13) from HERMES [44],
SMC [147], JLab RSS [24] and E94-010 [129], and the
SLAC experiments E142 [42], E143 [141] and E154 [161]
were used in the updated extraction analysis. Since Γn
1
is an integral over all x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), the unmeasured
low-x and high-x regions need to be accounted for in
a consistent fashion. The method we implemented for
all data sets is that shown in Ref. [160], with the ex-
ception of the HERMES and JLab data, which had al-
ready used such an extrapolation. The extrapolation
calls for ﬁtting the gn
1 data to an appropriate function
over the appropriate x-range. For the low-x region, the
ﬁt function was a constant f (x) = A, with A being a
free parameter. The ﬁt was performed over the range
xmin < x < x′, where x′ is the lowest measured x bin for
a given experiment. The lower bound xmin is deﬁned by
W = √1000 GeV. The uncertainty in this low-x extrapo-
lation was estimated by taking the diﬀerence between our
ﬁt of f (x) = A with that of a simple Regge parameter-
ization where f (x) = Ax−1/2 [162, 163]. For the high-x
region, the ﬁt function was f (x) = A(1 − x)3, with A
being a free parameter, over the range x′ < x < xmax.
The quantity x′ is the highest x bin for which there were
data available and xmax is deﬁned by the pion produc-
tion threshold, W = 1.12 GeV. The ﬁt functions for the
low- and high-x regions were chosen based on the trend
of the data in the last three or two bins in each case,
respectively.

The elastic contribution to Γn

1 was evaluated using the
Riordan [39] and Kelly [40] parameterizations, and was
added to all of the world data. The uncertainty on the
elastic contribution was estimated as the diﬀerence be-
tween using the Riordan (Kelly) parameterization for Gn
E
M ) compared to using Galster [164] (dipole) for Gn
(Gn
E
(Gn
M ). The resulting Γn
1 data from this analysis are pre-
sented in Appendix D.

In order to extract the higher-twist contribution, the
twist-2 contribution must ﬁrst be removed. Using the
OPE [15], Γn
1 was expanded as an inverse power series
in Q2, revealing the higher-twist components, that was
accessed by subtracting the leading twist (twist-2) con-
tribution. The twist-2 contribution µn
2 was calculated
using Eq. 14, where αs was parameterized according

to [165] and normalized to αs(cid:0)1 GeV2(cid:1) = 0.45± 0.05 for
ΛQCD = 315 MeV. We used Nf = 3 and Nloop = 3 [37],
gA = 1.2670 ± 0.0035 [166], and a8 = 0.579 ± 0.025 [166].
At large Q2, the higher-twist contributions should be
1 (cid:0)Q2(cid:1) =
small due to the Q−2 suppression; therefore, Γn

µ2(cid:0)Q2(cid:1). Because of this, the axial charge ∆Σ was ex-

tracted (Eq. 14) using the highest Q2-measurements from
SLAC E154 [161] (Q2 = 5 GeV2), SMC [147] (Q2 =
10 GeV2), and HERMES [44] (Q2 = 6.5 GeV2). Statis-
tically averaging the results of these experiments yielded
Q2 = 5.77 GeV2 and Γn
1 = −0.03851 ± 0.00535, resulting
in ∆Σ = 0.375 ± 0.052. This calculation is in excellent
agreement with [167].

As described in Appendix D, a ﬁt to Γn

1 − µ2 as a
function of Q2 allows the extraction of f n
2 after inserting
the average an
2 (see beginning of Section V B 3) and dn
2
from the present experiment. The extracted f n
2 values
are given in Table XII. This result diﬀers from that in
Ref. [152] because we have improved our analysis, where
we now include uncertainties on the low-x and elastic
terms in the Γn
1 analysis mentioned above; additionally,
our uncertainty on f n
2 has changed as we now consider
the full error matrix of our ﬁt function, accounting for
correlations between the ﬁt parameters A and B. Our
results reported here are larger than those in Ref. [152]
by about 11%, and the systematic uncertainty has been
reduced by nearly a factor of two.

Our result for f n

2 is compared to that from an instan-
ton model [168, 169] and QCD sum rule calculations from
E. Stein et al. [29, 170] and Balitsky et al. [30], shown
in Fig. 36. We ﬁnd good agreement with the instanton
model and reasonable agreement with the QCD sum rule
result from Balitsky et al. Currently, there are no lattice
QCD calculations of f n
2 , and it would be interesting to
see what a lattice approach would yield. One can com-
pare our result to that of Meziani et al. [160], who found
f n
2 = 0.034 ± 0.043 normalized to Q2 = 1 GeV2 using
a similar data set in their extraction of Γn
1 . The main
diﬀerence between these analyses was that they ﬁt world
neutron data to obtain an
2 and used the results of SLAC
2 , both at Q2 = 5 GeV2. In contrast, this
E155x [26] for dn
work used the measured dn

was obtained at the necessary Q2 from an average over
the global analyses [126, 132–134, 149]. The statistical

The results for the electric (F y,n

color forces averaged over the volume of the neutron are
shown in Table XIII and in Fig. 37, where we compare
to an instanton model [168, 169] and QCD sum rules
from Stein et al. [29, 170] and Balitsky et al. [30]. In the
ﬁgure, ﬁlled markers represent F y,n

ers indicate F y,n

netic color forces are approximately equal and opposite.
The electric color force component F y,n
E is in agreement
with the instanton model, while the magnetic component
F y,n
is consistent with the instanton model and QCD
sum rules. However, those calculations were performed
at Q2 = 0.4 and 1 GeV2, respectively. Note that the
values for F y,n
B reported here diﬀer from those
presented in Ref. [152] because we have re-evaluated the
color forces using the updated f n

ble XII. The central values for F y,n
at E = 4.74 GeV

(E = 5.89 GeV) have increased by 13% (12%), while for

The asymmetry An

1 (Section IV D) was extracted for

our DIS data at the two beam energies for (cid:10)Q2(cid:11) =
2.59 GeV2 (E = 4.74 GeV) and (cid:10)Q2(cid:11) = 3.67 GeV2 (E =

5.89 GeV); the results are given in Tables XIV and XV.
These results were averaged using the statistical uncer-
tainty as the weight, while the systematic uncertainties
were averaged using equal weights. The averaged results,
ﬁrst published in [171], are given in Table XVI and plot-
ted in Fig. 38. The systematic uncertainties are outlined
in tables given in Appendix E 6. The biggest contribu-
tion to the uncertainty is from the eﬀective proton polar-
ization. Our result is consistent with the trend seen in
current DIS data from SLAC E142 [42] and E154 [161],
HERMES [44] and JLab E99-117 [27, 45]. Although this
experiment was optimized for the measurement of dn
2 , we
obtained a data set with uncertainties that are compet-
itive with the previous JLab data from E99-117. Our
extraction provides a proof-of-principle measurement in
an open-geometry detector (BigBite) yielding data with
competitive uncertainties compared to the majority of
the world data in the mid-x range, and showing a zero-
crossing at x ≈ 0.5. Our data tend to follow the trend
of the pQCD-based parameterization that includes or-
bital angular momentum [48], possibly indicating the

importance of orbital angular momentum in the spin
of the nucleon. Our result also shows good agreement
with the NJL-type model from Clo¨et et al. [50]. Dyson-
Schwinger Equation treatment predictions [51] are pre-
sented at x = 1 (Fig. 38).

eﬀective proton polarization and from Ap

are comparable to the JLab E99-117 data [27, 45] in reach
and precision, and are consistent with the trend seen in
the DIS data from SLAC E143 [42] and E155 [172] as

C. Flavor decomposition via the quark-parton

model

Under the quark-parton model [173], if one assumes
that the strange quark distributions s(x), ¯s(x), ∆s(x)
and ∆¯s(x) are negligible for x > 0.3, and neglecting
any Q2-dependence in the ratio of structure functions,
the polarized-to-unpolarized quark ratios were extracted
through Eqs. 27 and 28. We utilized the Rdu ratio
from the CJ12 [140] model. Using our ﬁt to the gp
1/F p
1
world data sets, we obtained at leading order the quan-

(3.67 GeV2). The results are tabulated in Tables XVII
and XVIII. Averaging the two data sets, we obtained the

tities (∆u + ∆¯u) / (u + ¯u) and (cid:0)∆d + ∆ ¯d(cid:1) /(cid:0)d + ¯d(cid:1) for
E = 4.74 GeV (5.89 GeV) where (cid:10)Q2(cid:11) = 2.59 GeV2
values given in Table XIX at (cid:10)Q2(cid:11) = 3.08 GeV2. These

averaged results, ﬁrst published in [171], are compared
to various world data [27, 52–54] and theoretical calcu-
lations [47–49, 51] in Fig. 40. The uncertainty due to
neglecting the strange contribution was determined by
computing Eqs. 27 and 28 with the strange component
included [84]:

where the terms (. . .)s,¯s=0 are deﬁned in Eqs. 27 and 28.
The second term in Eqs. 50 and 51 is the strange contri-
bution, which was evaluated using various parameteriza-
tions [126, 132, 133, 140, 149] and taking the maximum
diﬀerence between calculations using all possible model
combinations as the uncertainty. It was found to be siz-
able in the lowest x-bins for the down-quark results, but
was small for x ≥ 0.424. For the up-quark results, the
strange uncertainty was small. The uncertainty due to
neglecting the strange contribution is included in our re-
ported uncertainties.

The extracted up-and down-quark ratios agree with
the general trend of the world data within our uncertain-
ties. Our analysis supports the notion that the down-
quark ratio stays negative into the large x region, with
no clear indication that it turns positive towards x ≃ 0.6,
as predicted by the Avakian et al. calculation [48].
The largest contribution to our systematic uncertain-
ties on the up-quark ratio is from our ﬁt to the gp
1/F p

data, while for the down-quark ratio, the largest contri-
butions are due to the gp
1 ﬁt and the d/u ratio. An
overview of the systematic uncertainties is given in Ap-
pendix E 7.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Scattering a longitudinally-polarized electron beam of
energies of E = 4.74 GeV and 5.89 GeV from a polar-
ized 3He target in two orientations,
longitudinal and
transverse (with respect to the electron beam momen-
tum), we measured the unpolarized electron-scattering
cross section with the LHRS and the electron double-spin
asymmetries with the BigBite spectrometer, with both
spectrometers set at 45◦ with respect to the beamline.
Combining the unpolarized cross sections and double-
spin asymmetries allowed the extraction of the twist-3
matrix element dn
2 . This quantity was extracted at two

(cid:10)Q2(cid:11) values of 3.21 GeV2 and 4.32 GeV2. The result at
the lower (cid:10)Q2(cid:11) value is small and negative, while that
for the higher (cid:10)Q2(cid:11) value is consistent with zero. The

data indicate a trend towards the Lattice QCD [34] cal-
culation at Q2 = 5 GeV2. The extracted dn
2 values are
also consistent with predictions of chiral soliton [31] and
bag [32, 35, 36] models. The size of the present dn

on all data sets are the in-quadrature sum of the statistical
and systematic uncertainties. Also presented is a statistical

we have extracted the twist-4 matrix element f n
2 . This
matrix element is observed to be larger than dn
2 in mag-
nitude, resulting in approximately equal and opposite
Lorentz color magnetic and electric forces in the neu-
tron. The results for f n
2 are consistent with instanton
model calculations [168, 169] and a QCD sum rule cal-
and F y,n
culation [29]. The extracted values for F y,n
are in agreement with the instanton model calculations
of [168, 169], while the value for F y,n
B is additionally in ac-
cordance with QCD sum-rule calculations from [29, 30].
We look forward to Lattice QCD calculations of the f n

matrix element, not yet available at this time due to their
diﬃculty, before the new wave of planned experiments in
the 12 GeV upgrade era of Jeﬀerson Lab to measure d2
and f2 with more precision.

Fitting the world g1/F1 data on the proton allowed the
extraction of (∆u + ∆¯u)/(u + ¯u) and (∆d + ∆ ¯d)/(d + ¯d)
when using the CJ12 [140] model for d/u. The extracted
up-quark ratio is consistent with existing measurements
and models, and its uncertainty is dominated by our ﬁt to
the world gp
1 data. The down-quark ratio is observed
to remain negative into the large-x region, with no clear
indication of a change to positive values in the range
of x ≃ 0.6 as predicted in Ref. [48]. The down-quark
ratio is very sensitive to the d/u ratio, as is evident in
the systematic errors. Better precision on d/u from the
projected experiment [174] at Jeﬀerson Lab in the 12 GeV
upgrade era will help to constrain the (∆d + ∆ ¯d)/(d + ¯d)
ratio.

A future experiment [175] proposed at Jeﬀerson Lab
calls for an even higher precision measurement of dn
2 at
four central Q2-bins in a range from 2 GeV2 to 7 GeV2.
While our data provide a good understanding of dn
2 at
Q2 = 3.21 and 4.32 GeV2, those data will provide a
direct comparison to the Lattice QCD calculation at
Q2 = 5 GeV2. There are also two dedicated An
1 experi-
ments approved to run at Jeﬀerson Lab [176, 177] that
aim to extend DIS An
1 measurements to larger x (∼ 0.77)
in addition to studying the Q2-evolution of the asymme-
try. These measurements are important for broadening
our insight in the large-x spin structure of the nucleon,
as suggested by the results presented in this paper.

1. Structure functions and cross sections

The extracted virtual photon asymmetry An

1 is consis-
tent with the current world data, especially JLab E99-
117 [27, 45], and shows good agreement with pQCD cal-
culations that incorporate quark orbital angular momen-
tum [48]. This suggests that orbital angular momentum

In electron scattering, the electrons are accelerated to
high energies and scatter from a nuclear or nucleon tar-
get. In practice, the target is typically ﬁxed. The elec-
tron interacts with the target by exchanging a virtual
photon with the target object, transferring its energy

and momentum to the target. An advantage of lepton
scattering is that the interaction at the leptonic vertex is
solely described by quantum electrodynamics, which sim-
pliﬁes the mathematics. The electromagnetic nature of
the interaction also results in the process being a “clean”
probe into the structure of the nucleon, where the QCD
physics is contained entirely in the description of the nu-
cleon and is not convoluted with the leptonic probe.

To describe the process more quantitatively, consider
Fig. 41. The incident and scattered electrons have the
four-momenta k = (E, ~k) and k′ = (E′, ~k′), respectively.
The target has a four-momentum of p = (ET , ~p). The
virtual photon exchanged between the incident electron
and the target has the four-momentum q = (ν, ~q).
If
the incident electron has enough energy, the target can
break up into a number of distinct hadrons; otherwise,
the target will remain intact. In the latter case, the re-
coiling target object would have a four-momentum p′ in
the ﬁnal hadronic state. Electron scattering data are
presented and discussed in terms of a number of Lorentz-
invariant variables, namely ν, y, Q2, W and x. Since the
four-momentum at each vertex is conserved, we begin by
deﬁning q in terms of the incoming and outgoing electron
four-momenta:

FIG. 41.
(Color online) A cartoon describing inclusive po-
larized electron-nucleon scattering. The large arrows indicate
possible spin orientations of the incident electron and nucleon.
The quantities s and S indicate the spin four-vectors of the
electron and nucleon, respectively. The other kinematic vari-
ables are described in the text.

q = k − k′ = (E − E′, ~k − ~k′) = (ν, ~q),
where ν can be deﬁned in an invariant form:

ν ≡ p · q/M,

(A1)

(A2)

with M being the mass of the nucleon. In the target rest
frame, p = (M,~0), so Eq. A2 reduces to ν = E − E′,
and is known as the electron energy loss. The fractional
energy loss, y, can be deﬁned in an invariant form:

36

which simpliﬁes to the non-invariant form y = (E −
E′)/E.
The four-momentum transfer squared, q2, always eval-
uates to less than or equal to zero. For convenience, we
deﬁne a positive quantity Q2:

Q2 ≡ −q2 = 4EE′ sin2 (θ/2) ,

(A4)

where θ is the scattering angle of the electron in the lab-
oratory frame and we have neglected the electron mass.
Shifting our focus to the hadronic side of Fig. 41, there
are two possibilities for the ﬁnal state: there is one object
(i.e., the target remains intact) or several, determined by
the energy with which the target is probed. Further-
more, the measured interaction may be described by two
general terms: exclusive or inclusive scattering. In the
case of exclusive scattering, the scattered electron and
all ﬁnal-state hadrons are detected; there is also the case
of detecting an electron and at least one particle in the
ﬁnal state, which is called semi-inclusive. For inclusive
scattering, only the scattered electron is detected in the
ﬁnal state.

Inclusive scattering can be represented as eN → eX,
where e is the electron, N is the target nucleon and X is
the ﬁnal (unmeasured) hadronic state. In the context of
an unmeasured ﬁnal hadronic state (which could consist
of any of the multitude of particle states for a given com-
bination of ν and Q2 values), we can deﬁne the invariant
mass of the system, W :

W 2 ≡ (q + p)2 = M 2 + 2M ν − Q2.

(A5)

Finally, we come to the variable x.

It is deﬁned in

terms of the other invariants ν and Q2 as:

x ≡

Q2
2p · q

=

Q2
2M ν

.

(A6)

The simplest interpretation of x comes in the inﬁnite
momentum frame, where the nucleon is traveling with a
large momentum along ~q. In this frame, the active quark
in the interaction (struck by the virtual photon) carries
the momentum fraction x of the nucleon momentum in
the leading-order DIS process [178].

The DIS region is characterized by W > 2 GeV, where
ν and Q2 become large enough so that the quarks can
be resolved inside the nucleon. In this case, the electron
is scattering from an asymptotically free quark (or anti-
quark) in the nucleon.

Consider scattering unpolarized electrons from point-
like, unpolarized spin-1/2 particles that are inﬁnitely
heavy with a charge of +1.
In this case, energy con-
servation dictates E′ = E and the cross section is given
by:

(A7)

with θ being the scattering angle of the electron. This
quantity is known as the Mott cross section. However,
since the nucleon is a composite object and is not in-
ﬁnitely massive, the cross section is more complicated
than that seen in Eq. A7, and is given by:

(A8)

where F1 and F2 are the unpolarized structure functions,
and are related to one another through Eq. 43.

For experiments that use targets that are not nucleons
(A 6= 1), there are two conventions for expressing the
quantities F1 and F2. The ﬁrst is per nucleon, written
as F1/A and F2/A. The second is per nucleus, where the
structure functions are reported without dividing by A.
The latter representation is used in this paper.

When both the incident electron beam and target are
polarized, one can access the spin structure functions g1
and g2. A full discussion may be found in Ref. [121].
The polarized cross section diﬀerence for when the target
spin (double arrows) and electron spin (single arrows) are
polarized along the direction of the electron momentum
is given as:

2. Bjorken scaling, the quark-parton model and

scaling violation

When probing an object of ﬁnite size, the measurement
will depend upon the spatial resolution of the probe; in
the case of electron scattering, this is Q2, the negative of
the momentum transferred to the target squared. If we
increase Q2 so that we can resolve the internal structure
of the nucleon, the quarks will become visible. At this
point, inelastic electron-nucleon scattering may be seen
as elastic scattering from a single quark, while the other
quarks remain undisturbed. Considering that quarks are
pointlike particles, increasing the resolution Q2 will no
longer aﬀect the interaction.

37

In the limit where Q2 → ∞ and ν → ∞, with x =
Q2/(2M ν) ﬁxed (the Bjorken limit), the phenomenon
where experimental observables lose their Q2-dependence
is known as Bjorken scaling [179]. As a result, the struc-
ture functions depend upon a single variable x. Further-
more, the F2 structure function can be related to the F1
structure function by the Callan-Gross relation [180]:

F2(x) = 2xF1(x).

(A11)

To connect the quark behavior to the structure func-
tions, we turn to the quark-parton model (QPM). In
this model, deep inelastic scattering of electrons from
nucleons is described as the incoherent scattering of elec-
trons from free partons (quarks and anti-quarks) inside
the nucleon [173], via the exchange of a virtual photon.
Therefore, the nucleon structure functions F1 and g1 can
be written in terms of the parton distribution functions

↑ (↓) indicates quark spin parallel (antiparallel) to the
parent nucleon spin.
The scaling behavior of the structure functions is only
exact in the limit of inﬁnite Q2 and ν. At ﬁnite values
of Q2 and ν, it is only an approximation. In reality, the
quarks participating in the interaction with the electron
may radiate gluons before or after scattering. Such pro-
cesses result in an inﬁnite cross section, and can only be
treated properly when all other processes of the same or-
der are considered. These gluonic radiative corrections
result in the cross section acquiring a logarithmic Q2
dependence, which can be computed exactly in pQCD
under the formalism of the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-
Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations [9]. As a
result, the Q2-dependence manifests itself in the struc-
ture functions.

As a result of the scaling violation, we re-cast the PDFs
and the structure functions in terms of both x and Q2. In
particular, the deﬁnition of the PDF is now q↑(↓)(x, Q2):
this is the probability of ﬁnding a quark q with its spin
parallel (antiparallel) to its parent nucleon with momen-

tum fraction x when viewed at an energy scale Q =pQ2.

The physical interpretation tied to scaling violation is
that structure functions at low Q2 are dominated by three
valence quarks “dressed” by sea quarks (manifesting as
q-¯q pairs) and gluons. As Q2 is increased, the resolving
power increases, allowing for sensitivity to the “bare”
quarks and gluons which make up the nucleon.

3. The resonance region

Due to the kinematics of our experiment, about half
of our data set corresponds to the DIS regime, while the
other corresponds to the resonance region. With this in
mind, we give a brief description of the resonance region.
When ν and Q2 have values such that 1.2 < W <
2 GeV, we explore the substructure of the nucleon.
In
this energy range, the quarks that make up the nucleon
collectively absorb the energy of the virtual photon, lead-
ing to unstable excited states of the nucleon called nu-
cleon resonances. The most prominent resonance occurs
at W = 1.232 GeV, and is known as the ∆ resonance.
Higher resonances are also possible at W > 1.4 GeV, but
are diﬃcult to discern from one another, as their peaks
and tails tend to overlap.

4. The virtual photon-nucleon asymmetry A1

Let us consider a scattering interaction in which the
nucleon is longitudinally polarized, while the virtual pho-
ton is circularly polarized with a helicity of ±1. As a re-
sult, two possible helicity-dependent cross sections for a
given nucleon polarization arise, denoted σ3/2 and σ1/2.
The subscripts denote the projection of the total spin of
the virtual photon-nucleon system along the direction of
the virtual photon momentum [95, 141]. When the vir-
tual photon spin is parallel (antiparallel) to the nucleon
spin, they add to 3/2 (1/2). From these two cross sec-
tions, the A1 asymmetry is formed as:

A1 ≡

σ1/2 − σ3/2
σ1/2 + σ3/2

.

(A14)

In terms of the structure functions, A1 may be written
as [121]:

A1(cid:0)x, Q2(cid:1) =

g1(cid:0)x, Q2(cid:1) − γ2g2(cid:0)x, Q2(cid:1)

F1 (x, Q2)

.

(A15)

At large Q2, A1 ≈ g1/F1. This can be seen by observing
that γ2 → 0 as Q2 gets increasingly large. A concep-
tual argument on the quark level is as follows:
if the
spin of the virtual photon is antiparallel to that of the
quark, then the virtual photon can be absorbed and the
quark spin is ﬂipped; however, if the spins are parallel,
then the absorption of the virtual photon is forbidden,
since the total projection of the spins along ~q is 3/2
and the quark is a spin-1/2 particle. The mathemati-
cal form of the approximation can be illustrated using
this physical interpretation: for the case where the spins
of the nucleon and virtual photon are parallel (σ3/2),
then the quark that can absorb the virtual photon has
its spin antiparallel to the nucleon spin. This translates
i (x). A similar argument may be made

i q↓
e2

to: σ3/2 ∼Pi

38

for the σ1/2 case where only quarks with spins parallel to
the parent nucleon can absorb virtual photons. Thus, we
i (x). Rewriting A1 in terms of these

i q↑
e2

have: σ1/2 ∼Pi

approximations, we obtain:

A1 ∼ Pi

,

(A16)
where the last term arises from the quark-parton model
description of the F1 and g1 structure functions (Eqs. A12
and A13).

The A1 asymmetry is a ratio of structure functions
(≈ g1/F1), and as a result there is very little Q2 depen-
dence. This is because g1 and F1 follow the same Q2
evolution described by the DGLAP equations [9] which
tends to cancel in the ratio, leading to A1 being roughly
Q2-independent.

5. Electron asymmetries

The virtual photon-nucleon asymmetry A1 is deﬁned
in terms of a ratio of the diﬀerence in virtual photon
cross sections to their sum. Due to the diﬃculty asso-
ciated with aligning the virtual photon spin along the
direction of the nucleon spin, another approach is uti-
lized to measure A1 that consists of aligning the incident
electron spin relative to the direction of the nucleon spin.
The extraction of the electron asymmetries allows the
determination of A1. After some algebra, the electron
asymmetries (Section I B) may be written as [153]:

Ak = D (A1 + ηA2)
A⊥ = d (A2 − ηA1) .

(A17)
(A18)

is

The

deﬁned

as A2

asymmetry A2

≡
2σLT /(cid:0)σ1/2 + σ3/2(cid:1), where σLT is the cross section
describing the interference between virtual photons
with longitudinal and transverse polarizations.
In the
QPM, there is no clear interpretation for σLT , and in
turn A2, as there is for σ1/2, σ3/2 and A1 [181]. From
Eqs. A17 and A18, one can write A1 and A2 in terms
of the double-spin asymmetries Ak and A⊥. Similar
equations may be obtained for g1/F1 and g2/F1 [153].
The equations for A1 and g1/F1 are shown in Section I C.

6. Spin structure functions

The spin structure functions g1 and g2 may be obtained
from the measured unpolarized cross section σ0 and the
double-spin asymmetries Ak and A⊥ through:

39

(A19)

(A20)

where n indicates the nth moment. In Eqs B3 and B4,
only twist-2 and twist-3 contributions are considered.
The quantities an−1 and dn−1 represent the twist-2 and
twist-3 matrix elements, respectively [182]. The expan-
sions are only over odd integers, which is a result of the
symmetry of the structure functions under charge conju-
gation [183].

The twist-3 matrix elements dn−1 may be accessed by

combining Eqs. B3 and B4. One obtains [153]:

g1 =

Appendix B: Quark-gluon correlations

1. The operator product expansion and twist

The operator product expansion (OPE) allows the sep-
aration of the perturbative and non-perturbative compo-
nents in structure functions at ﬁnite Q2. This concept is
illustrated in the product of two local quark (or gluon)
operators Oa(d)Ob separated by a distance d in the limit
of d → 0:

lim

d→0Oa(d)Ob(0) =Xk

cabk(d)Ok(0),

(B1)

where the coeﬃcient functions cabk are the Wilson
coeﬃcients and contain the perturbative part, which
can be computed using perturbation theory since non-
perturbative eﬀects occur at distances much larger than
d [11]. The non-perturbative components manifest in
Ok(0), and contribute to the cross section on the order
of x−n(Q/M )D−2−n. The exponents n and D are the
spin and (mass) dimension of the operator, respectively.

The quantity Q = pQ2. The twist τ of the operator is

deﬁned by:

τ ≡ D − n.

(B2)

At large Q2, τ = 2 terms dominate in the OPE; at low
Q2, higher-twist (τ > 2) operators become important.

2. Cornwall-Norton moments and Nachtmann

moments

Using the OPE, an inﬁnite set of sum rules may be de-
rived under a twist expansion of the spin structure func-
tions g1 and g2 [121]. Such expansions of g1 and g2 are
known as the Cornwall-Norton (CN) moments [153]:

Z 1

xn−1(cid:20)g1(cid:0)x, Q2(cid:1) +

n

n − 1

g2(cid:0)x, Q2(cid:1)(cid:21) dx =

dn−1

2

, n ≥ 3.
(B5)

Choosing n = 3 yields the equation for d2 (cf. Eq. 4).

The study of higher twist in structure functions has
traditionally been done through the formalism of the CN
moments; however, the exact relation of the CN mo-
ments to the dynamical higher-twist contributions has
come into question in recent analyses [153, 184]. It is ar-
gued that the CN moments are only valid when the terms
connected to the ﬁnite mass of the nucleon are neglected.
Such terms are known as target mass corrections. These
corrections are related to twist-2 operators, and are of
order O(M 2/Q2). Analogous to the CN moments, the
Nachtmann moments M1 and M2 can be used to sepa-
rate the higher-twist contribution from the target mass
corrections [154, 185]. They are deﬁned as [24, 153, 186]:

We have performed the analysis to extract dn

2 accord-
ing to the CN moments, and checked that result against
what was obtained from using the Nachtmann moments.
The diﬀerence in results between the two approaches was
found to be negligible, on the order of 10−5 in absolute
value.

Appendix C: Fits to data

1. Cross section ﬁts

As discussed in Section IV B, due to time constraints
not all cross section measurements for studying pair pro-
duction on 3He and N2 were carried out. To resolve the
absence of those data, the data that were collected were
ﬁt to a function of the form:

f (Ep) =

1
E2
p

e(a0+a1Ep),

(C1)

, σe−

N2 and σe+

where the scattered electron energy Ep is in GeV. This
was done for σe+
N . The ﬁts were performed
in ROOT [86], and the extracted parameters and their
uncertainties were obtained from the Minuit minimiza-
tion package [187]. The ﬁts were done separately for the
data sets corresponding to each beam energy. The sys-
tematic uncertainties on the ﬁts was obtained by vary-
ing the parameters within their errors and observing the
change on the ﬁt (see Figs 18 and 19). The parameters to-
gether with their uncertainties are listed in Table XX for
the nitrogen cross section when scattered electrons were
detected, σe−
N2 (LHRS set to negative polarity mode), and
in Table XXI when positrons were detected, σe+
N2 (LHRS
in positive polarity mode). Table XXII gives the ﬁt pa-
rameters and their uncertainties for the unpolarized 3He
cross section where positrons were detected, σe+
(LHRS
in positive polarity mode).

was needed. We ﬁt the world data to a three-parameter,
Q2-independent function given by:

f (x) = p0 + p1x + p2x2.

(C2)

The assumption of Q2-independence is reasonable as the
Q2-evolution in g1 and F1 partially cancels in the ratio
to leading order and next-to-leading order in Q2 [121].
Additionally, the world data (which are at diﬀering Q2)
show roughly the same behavior. The world data con-
sidered were from HERMES [44], SLAC E143 [141] and
E155 [137], along with CLAS EG1b [54] and CLAS EG1-
DVCS [142]. First, all of these data were rebinned in x,
in new bins formed based on a statistical-error-weighted
average; the systematic errors of all data contributing to
a new bin were averaged with equal weights to yield its
systematic error. The ﬁt result, with χ2/ndf = 0.91, is
shown in Fig. 42 The ﬁt parameters were found to be:

p0 = 0.035 ± 0.008
p1 = 1.478 ± 0.077
p2 = −1.010 ± 0.138.

(C3)

The ﬁt was performed in ROOT [86], and the extracted
parameters and their uncertainties were obtained from
the Minuit minimization package [187]. The band indi-
cates the uncertainty on the ﬁt which was taken as the
spread in the gp

mate.

1. Final unpolarized cross section systematic

uncertainties

The breakdown of the systematic uncertainty on the
unpolarized cross sections is given in Tables XXIII
and XXIV. The column “Cuts” indicates uncertainties
due to event cuts, which includes the gas ˇCerenkov,
E/p, and target cuts to remove the target windows;
“Background” corresponds to uncertainties related to the
positron and nitrogen background subtractions; “Misc.”
refers to the uncertainties incurred from the beam charge
calibration, and the density of nitrogen and 3He in the
target cell; “RC” is the uncertainty due to the radia-
tive corrections, as explained in Section IV B 3. The ﬁnal
column (“Total”) gives the in-quadrature sum of all un-
certainties in the row.

2. Final asymmetry systematic uncertainties

Tables XXV, XXVIII, XXVII and XXVIII list the sys-
tematic uncertainties assigned to the double-spin physics
asymmetries Ak and A⊥ on 3He. The systematic uncer-
tainty depends on the electron beam polarization Pb, the
target polarization Pb, the nitrogen dilution factor DN2,
and contaminations in the BigBite analysis due to π−
(f1), π+ (f2), and e+ (f3). Also there are contributions
from the electron selection cuts (“Cuts”) and the radia-
tive corrections (“RC”). The ﬁnal column (“Total”) is
the in-quadrature sum of the uncertainties in each row.

polarized 3He cross section at E = 5.89 GeV. All uncertainties
are in nb/GeV/sr. See Appendix E 1 for a discussion of the
various contributions to the systematic uncertainty.

3. Polarized spin structure function systematic

uncertainties

Tables XXIX, XXXI, XXX and XXXII list the system-
atic uncertainties assigned to the polarized spin-structure
functions. A number of factors contribute to the sys-
tematic uncertainty, including kinematics (“Kin.”) and
all of the systematic uncertainties found to contribute
to the ﬁnal asymmetries, namely Pb, Pt, f1, f2 f3, PID
cuts (“Cuts”) and radiative corrections (“RC”). Other
contributions include the systematic uncertainty on the
unpolarized cross section (σ0), in addition to the uncer-
tainties associated with the interpolation or extrapola-
tion of the data where necessary. The value for each
these uncertainties was determined by varying each of
these contributions within reasonable limits and taking
3He
the corresponding change in the observable (either g
1
) as the uncertainty. The last column (“Total”) is
or g
the in-quadrature sum of the uncertainties in each row.

This section discusses the breakdown of the system-
3He
atic uncertainties on A
1 . The main factors
1
that contribute to the uncertainties on the 3He data are
the physics asymmetries Ak and A⊥, and the kinematic
factors D, η, ξ and d (see Section I C). Each physics asym-
metry was varied within its uncertainty, and the change
3He
in A
1 was observed. For the kinematics, the low-level

variables of the electron momentum p and scattering an-
gle θ were changed within their relative uncertainties of
1% and 1.4% [84] respectively, and the kinematic factors
were re-evaluated, and the change in the A1 asymmetry
was observed. The resulting contributions to the sys-
3He
tematic uncertainty in A
are listed in Tables XXXVI
1
and XXXVII for the 4.74 GeV and 5.89 GeV runs, respec-
tively.

Tables XLIV and XLV give a breakdown of the sys-
tematic uncertainties at E = 4.74 GeV for the up and
down quark ratios, respectively. Tables XLVI and XLVII
list the uncertainties for E = 5.89 GeV. The columns of
the table represent the contribution due to our gn
1 /F n

1 data, the (d + ¯d)/(u + ¯u) pa-
data, our ﬁt to world gp
rameterization, and the strange uncertainty, respectively.
The value of these uncertainties, except for the strange
uncertainty (see Section V C), was determined by varying
each of these contributions within reasonable limits and
taking the change in the quark ratio as the uncertainty.
This was done for both the up and down quark ratios.
The in-quadrature sum of all contributions is displayed
in the last column, labeled “Total.”

[107] A prescale factor restricts the number of events accepted
for a given trigger. For example, a prescale of 100 means
that one event per every 100 will be accepted. It was
used to either remove certain types of events entirely,
or to restrict events due to high rates.

[108] 1 amagat = 2.6867805 × 1025 m−3.

[109] The live-time is deﬁned as the ratio of the number of
triggers accepted by the DAQ to the total number of
triggers generated for a given run [84]. This factor cor-
rects for the high trigger rates during the experiment,
which prevent the detectors from recording every event.
