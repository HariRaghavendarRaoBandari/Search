We provide generalized entanglement constraints in multi-qubit systems in terms of Tsallis en-
tropy. Using quantum Tsallis entropy of order q, we ﬁrst provide a generalized monogamy inequality
of multi-qubit entanglement for q = 2 or 3. This generalization encapsulates multi-qubit CKW-type
inequality as a special case. We further provide a generalized polygamy inequality of multi-qubit
entanglement in terms of Tsallis-q entropy for 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 or 3 ≤ q ≤ 4, which also contains the
multi-qubit polygamy inequality as a special case.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum Tsallis entropy is a one-parameter general-
ization of von Neumann entropy with respect to a non-
negative real parameter q [1, 2]. Tsallis entropy is used
in many areas of quantum information theory; Tsallis en-
tropy can be used to characterize classical statistical cor-
relations inherented in quantum states [3], and it provides
some conditions for separability of quantum states [4–6].
There are also discussions about using the non-extensive
statistical mechanics to describe quantum entanglement
in terms of Tsallis entropy [7].

As a function deﬁned on the set of density matrices,
Tsallis entropy is concave for all q > 0, which plays an
important role in quantum entanglement theory. Because
the concavity of Tsallis entropy assures the property of
entanglement monotone [8], it can be used to construct a
faithful entanglement measure, which does not increase
under local quantum operations and classical communi-
cation (LOCC).

One distinct property of quantum entanglement from
other classical correlations is that multi-party entangle-
ment cannot be freely shared among the parties. This
restricted shareability of entanglement in multi-party
quantum systems is known as monogamy of entangle-
ment(MoE) [9, 10]. MoE is a key ingredient for secure
quantum cryptography [11, 12], and it also plays an im-
portant role in condensed-matter physics such as the N -
representability problem for fermions [13].

Using concurrence [14] as a bipartite entanglement
measure, Coﬀman-Kundu-Wootters(CKW) provided a
mathematical characterization of MoE in three-qubit sys-
tems as an inequality [15], which was generalized for arbi-
trary multi-qubit systems [16]. As a dual concept of MoE,
a polygamy inequality of multi-qubit entanglement was
established in terms of Concurrence of Assistance(CoA).
Later, it was shown that the monogamy and polygamy in-

equalities of multi-qubit entanglement can also be estab-
lished by using other entropy-based entanglement mea-
sures such as R´enyi, Tsallis and uniﬁed entropies [17–19].

Recently, a diﬀerent kind of monogamous relation in
multi-qubit entanglement was proposed by using concur-
rence and CoA [20]. Whereas the CKW-type monogamy
inequalities of multi-qubit entanglement provide a lower
bound of bipartite entanglement between one qubit sub-
system and the rest qubits in terms of two-qubit entangle-
ment, the new kind of monogamy relations in [20] provide
bounds of bipartite entanglement between a two-qubit
subsystem and the rest in multi-qubit systems in terms
of two-qubit concurrence and CoA.

Here, we provide generalized entanglement constraints
in multi-qubit systems in terms of Tsallis entropy for a
selective choice of the real parameter q. Using quan-
tum Tsallis entropy of order q, namely Tsallis-q entropy,
we ﬁrst show that the CKW-type monogamy inequal-
ity of multi-qubit entanglement can have a generalized
form for q = 2 or 3. This generalized monogamy in-
equality encapsulates multi-qubit CKW-type monogamy
inequality as a special case. We further provide a gener-
alized polygamy inequality of multi-qubit entanglement
in terms of Tsallis-q entropy for 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 or 3 ≤ q ≤ 4,
which also contains multi-qubit polygamy inequality as
a special case.

This paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II A,
we recall the deﬁnition of Tsallis-q entropy, and the
bipartite entanglement measure based on Tsallis en-
tropy, namely Tsallis-q entanglement as well as its dual
quantity, Tsallis-q entanglement of assistance(TEoA). In
Sec. II B, we review the analytic evaluations of Tsallis-q
entanglement and TEoA in two-qubit systems based on
their functional relations with concurrence, and we fur-
ther review the monogamy and polygamy inequalities of
multi-qubit entanglement in terms of Tsallis-q entangle-
ment and TEoA in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, we provide gen-
eralized monogamy and polygamy inequalities of multi-
qubit entanglement in terms of Tsallis-q entanglement
and TEoA, and we summarize our results in Sec. V.

II. TSALLIS-q ENTANGLEMENT

A. Deﬁnition

Using a generalized logarithmic function with respect

to the parameter q,

lnq x =

x1−q − 1
1 − q

,

(1)

quantum Tsallis-q entropy for a quantum state ρ is de-
ﬁned as

Sq (ρ) = −trρq lnq ρ =

1 − tr (ρq)

q − 1

(2)

for q > 0, q 6= 1 [2]. Although the quantum Tsallis-q
entropy has a singularity at q = 1, it converges to von
Neumann entropy when q tends to 1 [21],

lim
q→1

Sq (ρ) = −trρ ln ρ = S (ρ) .

(3)

Based on Tsallis-q entropy, a class of bipartite entan-
glement measures was introduced; for a bipartite pure
state |ψiAB and each q > 0,
its Tsallis-q entangle-
ment [18] is

2

As a dual quantity to Tsallis-q entanglement, Tsallis-q

entanglement of Assistance(TEoA) was deﬁned as [18]

q (cid:0)ρA|B(cid:1) := maxXi
T a

piTq(|ψiiA|B),

(9)

where the maximum is taken over all possible pure state
decompositions of ρAB. Similarly, we have

q→1 T a
lim

q (cid:0)ρA|B(cid:1) = Ea(cid:0)ρA|B(cid:1) ,

(10)

where Ea(ρA|B) is the Entanglement of Assistance (EoA)
of ρAB deﬁned as [23]

Ea(ρA|B) = maxXi

piS(ρi

A).

(11)

with the maximization over all possible pure state de-
compositions of ρAB.

B. Functional relation with concurrence in

two-qubit systems

For any bipartite pure state |ψiAB, its concurrence is

deﬁned as [14]

Tq(cid:16)|ψiA|B(cid:17) = Sq(ρA),

where ρA = trB|ψiABhψ| is the reduced density matrix
of |ψiAB onto subsystem A. For a bipartite mixed state
ρAB, its Tsallis-q entanglement is deﬁned via convex-roof
extension,

(4)

C(|ψiA|B) =q2(1 − trρ2

A),

(12)

where ρA = trB(|ψiABhψ|). For a mixed state ρAB, its
concurrence and concurrence of assistance(CoA) are de-
ﬁned as

Tq(cid:0)ρA|B(cid:1) = minXi

piTq(|ψiiA|B),

(5)

and

C(ρA|B) = minXk

pkC(|ψkiA|B),

(13)

where the minimum is taken over all possible pure state

Because Tsallis-q entropy converges to von Neumann

entropy when q tends to 1, we have

decompositions of ρAB =Pi pi|ψiiABhψi|.
q→1Tq(cid:0)ρA|B(cid:1) = Ef(cid:0)ρA|B(cid:1) ,

lim

where Ef (ρAB) is the EoF [22] of ρAB deﬁned as

Ef (ρA|B) = minXi

piS(ρi

A),

with the minimization over all possible pure state decom-
positions of ρAB,

pi|ψiiABhψi|,

ρAB =Xi
and trB|ψiiABhψi| = ρi
A. In other words, Tsallis-q en-
tanglement is one-parameter generalization of EoF, and
the singularity of Tq (ρAB) at q = 1 can be replaced by
Ef (ρAB).

pkC(|ψkiA|B),

(14)

respectively, where the minimum and maximum are
taken over all possible pure state decompositions, ρAB =

Pk pk|ψkiABhψk|.

For two-qubit systems, concurrence and CoA are
known to have analytic formulae [14]; for any two-qubit
state ρAB,

C(ρA|B) = max{0, λ1 − λ2 − λ3 − λ4},

tion between concurrence and Tsallis-q entanglement in

two-qubit systems [18]. For any two-qubit state ρAB (or
bipartite pure state with Schmidt-rank 2), we have

the Tsallis monogamy inequality of multi-qubit entangle-
ment was proposed as

Here we note that the analytic evaluation of concur-
rence in Eq. (15) together with the functional relations
in Eq. (17) provides us with an analytic formula of Tsallis
entanglement in two-qubit systems. Moreover, the mono-
tonicity and convexity of fq(x) for 1 ≤ q ≤ 4 also provide
an analytic lower bound of TEoA,

q (cid:0)ρA|B(cid:1) ≥ fq(cid:0)C a(ρA|B)(cid:1) ,

where the equality holds q = 2 or 3 [18].

III. MULTI-QUBIT ENTANGLEMENT
CONSTRAINTS IN TERMS OF TSALLIS

ENTROPY

The monogamy of a multi-qubit entanglement was
shown to have a mathematical characterization as an in-
equality; for a multi-qubit state ρA1A2···An,

, (20)

≥ C(cid:0)ρA1|A2(cid:1)2

+ ··· + C(cid:0)ρA1|An(cid:1)2

C(cid:0)ρA1|A2···An(cid:1)2
where C(ρA1|A2···An ) is the concurrence of ρA1A2···An with
respect to the bipartition between A1 and the other
qubits, and C(ρA1|Ai) is the concurrence of the two-qubit
reduced density matrix ρA1Ai for i = 2, . . . , n [15, 16].
Moreover, the polygamy (or dual monogamy) inequality
of multi-qubit entanglement was also established using
CoA [25] as

Later,

(cid:0)C a(cid:0)ρA1|A2···An(cid:1)(cid:1)2
≤ (C a(cid:0)ρA1|A2(cid:1))2+···+(C a(cid:0)ρA1|An(cid:1))2,
(21)
where C a(ρA1|A2···An ) is the CoA of ρA1A2···An with re-
spect to the bipartition between A1 and the other qubits,
and C a(cid:0)ρA1|Ai(cid:1) is the CoA of the two-qubit reduced den-

sity matrix ρA1Ai for i = 2, . . . , n.

this mathematical

of
monogamy and polygamy of multi-qubit entangle-
ment was also proposed in terms of Tsallis entropy,
which encapsulate the inequalities (20) and (21) as
special cases
[18]. Based on the following property of

Tq(cid:0)ρA1|A2···An(cid:1) ≥ Tq(ρA1|A2) + ··· + Tq(ρA1|An),
for 2 ≤ q ≤ 3.
For the case when 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 or 3 ≤ q ≤ 4, the function
fq(x) in Eq. (18) also satisﬁes

(23)

fq(cid:16)px2 + y2(cid:17) ≤ fq(x) + fq(y),

which leads to the Tsallis polygamy inequality

IV. GENERALIZED MULTI-QUBIT

ENTANGLEMENT CONSTRAINTS IN TERMS

OF TSALLIS ENTROPY

In this section, we provide generalized monogamy and
polygamy inequalities of multi-qubit entanglement in
terms of Tsallis entanglement and TEoA. We ﬁrst recall
some properties of Tsallis entropy.

Proposition 1. (Subadditivity of Tsallis entropy) For
any bipartite quantum state ρAB with ρA = trBρAB,
ρB = trAρAB, and q ≥ 1, we have

Sq (ρAB) ≤ Sq (ρA) + Sq (ρB) .

(26)

Let us consider a three-party pure state |ψiABC and
its reduced density matrices ρBC = trA|ψiABChψ|, ρB =
trAC|ψiABChψ| and ρC = trAB|ψiABChψ|. For q ≥ 1,
Proposition 1 implies

Sq (ρBC ) ≤ Sq (ρB) + Sq (ρC ) .

(27)

Because Sq (ρBC ) = Sq (ρA) and Sq (ρC ) = Sq (ρAB),

Eq. (27) can be rewritten as

Sq (ρA) − Sq (ρB) ≤ Sq (ρAB) ,

and similarly, we also have

Sq (ρB) − Sq (ρA) ≤ Sq (ρAB) .

(28)

(29)

Thus we have the following triangle inequality of Tsallis
entropy

|Sq (ρA) − Sq (ρB)| ≤ Sq (ρAB) ≤ Sq (ρA) + Sq (ρB) ,

(30)

for any bipartite quantum state ρAB and q ≥ 1.

Theorem 1. For q = 2 or 3 and any multi-qubit pure
state |ψiABC1C2···Cn, we have
Tq(cid:16)|ψiAB|C1C2···Cn(cid:17) ≥

q (ρB|Ci)(cid:3) ,

and

ρAB

ρACi

where
trBC1...Ci−1Ci+1...Cn(|ψihψ|)
trAC1...Ci−1Ci+1...Cn(|ψihψ|).
Proof. For
simplicity, we sometimes denote C =
{C1, C2,··· , Cn}. From the deﬁnition of Tsallis entan-
glement of |ψiABC1C2···Cn with respect to the bipartition
between AB and C, we have

ρBCi

=
=

Tq(cid:16)|ψiAB|C(cid:17) =Sq (ρAB)

≥Sq (ρA) − Sq (ρB)
=Tq(cid:16)|ψiA|BC(cid:17) − Tq(cid:16)|ψiB|AC(cid:17) ,

(32)

where the inequality is due to the Inequality (30).

We note that for any pure state |ψiABC in a 2 ⊗ 2 ⊗ d
quantum system with reduced density matrices ρAB =
trC|ψiABChψ| and ρAC = trB|ψiABChψ|, we have [26]

C(cid:16)|ψiA|BC(cid:17)2

= C a(cid:0)ρA|B(cid:1)2

+ C(cid:0)ρA|C(cid:1)2

.

(33)

For q = 2 or 3, Inequalities (22) and (24) imply that

fq(cid:16)px2 + y2(cid:17) = fq(x) + fq(y),

therefore

(34)

(35)

Tq(cid:16)|ψiA|BC(cid:17) =fq(cid:16)C(cid:16)|ψiA|BC(cid:17)(cid:17)

=fq(cid:0)C a(cid:0)ρA|B(cid:1)(cid:1) + fq(cid:0)C(cid:0)ρA|C(cid:1)(cid:1) ,

where the last equality is due to Eq. (34). Moreover, we
also have

Tq(cid:16)|ψiB|AC(cid:17) =fq(cid:16)C(cid:16)|ψiB|AC(cid:17)(cid:17)

where the ﬁrst inequality is due to Inequality (20) and

functional relation of two-qubit concurrence and Tsallis
entanglement in Eq. (17). Moreover, we also have

where the ﬁrst equality is from the iterative use of
Eq. (34), and the last inequality is from Inequality (19).

From Inequalities (37), (38) and (39), we have

which, together with Inequality (32), completes the
proof.

Theorem 1 provides a monogamy-type lower bound
of multi-qubit entanglement between two-qubit subsys-
tem AB and the other n-qubit subsystem C1C2 ··· Cn
in terms of two-qubit entanglements inherent there. For
the case when one-qubit subsystem B is separable from
other qubits, Inequality (31) reduces to the CKW-type
monogamy inequality in (23), thus Theorem 1 provides a
generalized monogamy relation of multi-qubit entangle-
ment in terms of Tsallis entropy. The lower bound pro-
vided in Theorem 1 is analytically obtainable due to the
analytic evaluation of two-qubit concurrence and CoA as
well as their functional relation with Tsallis entanglement
provided in Eq. (17) and Inequality (19).

Now, we present a generalized polygamy relation of
multi-qubit entanglement in terms of TEoA. We ﬁrst pro-
vide the following theorem, which shows a reciprocal re-
lation of TEoA in three-party quantum systems.

Theorem 2. For q ≥ 1 any three-party quantum state
ρABC , we have

q (cid:0)ρA|BC(cid:1) ≤T a
T a

q (cid:0)ρB|AC(cid:1) + T a

q (cid:0)ρC|AB(cid:1) .

Proof. Let

(42)

be an optimal decomposition realizing T a
is,

q (cid:0)ρA|BC(cid:1), that

(43)

pjTq(cid:16)|ψjiA|BC(cid:17) .

For each pure state |ψjiABC in the decomposition (42)
B = trAC|ψjiABChψj| and

q (cid:0)ρA|BC(cid:1) =Xj
T a
BC = trA|ψjiABChψj|, ρj
with ρj
ρj
C = trAB|ψjiABChψj|, we have
Tq(cid:16)|ψjiA|BC(cid:17) =Sq(cid:16)ρj
≤Sq(cid:16)ρj
=Tq(cid:16)|ψjiB|AC(cid:17) + Tq(cid:16)|ψjiC|AB(cid:17) , (44)

BC(cid:17)
B(cid:17) + Sq(cid:16)ρj
C(cid:17)

where the inequality is due to the subadditivity of Tsallis
entropy in Proposition 1.

Now we have

pjTq(cid:16)|ψjiA|BC(cid:17)
q (cid:0)ρA|BC(cid:1) =Xj
T a
pjTq(cid:16)|ψjiB|AC(cid:17) +Xj

≤T a
q (cid:0)ρC|AB(cid:1) ,

pjTq(cid:16)|ψjiC|AB(cid:17)

(45)

where the ﬁrst inequality is from Inequality (44), and the
second inequality is due to the deﬁnition of TEoA.

Theorem 2 shows the reciprocal relation of TEoA in
three-party quantum systems; the sum of two TEoA’s
with respect to two possible bipartition(B—AC and
C—AB) always bounds the TEoA with respect to the
remaining bipartition (A—BC). Moreover, the iterative
use of Inequality (41) naturally leads us to the general-
ization of Theorem 2 into multi-party quantum systems.

quantum state ρABC with C = C1C2 ··· Cn, Theorem 2
leads us to

q (cid:0)ρAB|C(cid:1) ≤T a
T a

q (cid:0)ρA|BC(cid:1) + T a

Inequality (49) together with Inequalities (50) lead us to
Inequality (48).

Corollary 2 provides a polygamy-type upper bound
of multi-qubit entanglement between two-qubit subsys-
tem AB and the other n-qubit subsystem C1C2 ··· Cn in
terms of two-qubit TEoA inherent there. For the case
when one-qubit subsystem B is independent from other
qubits (that is, ρABC = ρAC ⊗ ρB), Inequality (48) re-
duces to the Tsallis polygamy inequality in (25). In other
words, Corollary 2 shows a generalized polygamy relation
of multi-qubit entanglement in terms of TEoA.

V. CONCLUSION

We have provided generalized entanglement con-
straints in multi-qubit systems in terms of Tsallis-q en-
tanglement and TEoA. We have shown that the CKW-
type monogamy inequality of multi-qubit entanglement
can have a generalized form in terms of Tsallis-q entan-
glement and TEoA for q = 2 or 3. This generalized
monogamy inequality encapsulates multi-qubit CKW-
type inequality as a special case. We have further shown

a generalized polygamy inequality of multi-qubit entan-
glement in terms of TEoA for 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 or 3 ≤ q ≤ 4,
which also contains multi-qubit polygamy inequality as
a special case.

Whereas entanglement in bipartite quantum systems
has been intensively studied with rich understanding, the
situation becomes far more diﬃcult for the case of multi-
party quantum systems, and very few are known for its
characterization and quantiﬁcation. MoE is a fundamen-
tal property of multi-party quantum entanglement, which
also provides various applications in quantum informa-
tion theory. Thus, it is an important and even necessary
task to characterize MoE to understand the whole picture
of multi-party quantum entanglement.

Although MoE is a typical property of multipartite
quantum entanglement, it is however about the relation
of bipartite entanglements among the parties in multipar-
tite systems. Thus, it is inevitable and crucial to have
a proper way of quantifying bipartite entanglement for a

good description of the monogamy nature in multi-party
quantum entanglement.

Our result presented here deals with Tsallis-q entropy,
a one-parameter class of entropy functions and provide
suﬃcient conditions on the choice of the parameter q for
generalized monogamy and polygamy relations of multi-
qubit entanglement. Noting the importance of the study
on multi-party quantum entanglement, our result pro-
vides a useful methodology to understand the monogamy
and polygamy nature of multi-party entanglement.
