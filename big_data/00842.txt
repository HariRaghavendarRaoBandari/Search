The control of network-coupled nonlinear dynamical systems is an active area of research in the nonlinear
science community. Coupled oscillator networks represent a particularly important family of nonlinear sys-
tems, with applications ranging from the power grid to cardiac excitation. Here we study the control of
network-coupled limit cycle oscillators, extending previous work that focused on phase oscillators. Based on
stabilizing a target ﬁxed point, our method aims to attain complete frequency synchronization, i.e., consensus,
by applying control to as few oscillators as possible. We develop two types of control. The ﬁrst type directs
oscillators towards to larger amplitudes, while the second does not. We present numerical examples of both
control types and comment on the potential failures of the method.

Collective rhythms in ensembles of interacting
units generate novel phenomena in mathematics,
physics, engineering, and biology1,2. Moreover,
robust collective rhythms characterized by syn-
chronization is vital to the functionality of sys-
tems ranging from power grids3 and Josephson
junction arrays4 to cardiac tissue5 and circadian
rhythms6. This has motivated a need for control
and optimization methods for coupled oscillator
networks – speciﬁcally towards attaining consen-
sus among the individual oscillators7,8. In a re-
cent publication we developed a simple control
mechanism for attaining consensus in networks of
coupled phase-oscillators based on identifying and
stabilizing a target synchronized state9. Here we
extend this this method to the case of networks of
nonlinear limit-cycle oscillators, where the state
of each oscillator is characterized not only by a
phase angle, but also an amplitude10. While the
presence of an amplitude for each oscillator yields
a richer set of dynamical states overall, we ﬁnd
that consensus can still be attained in this more
complicated scenario.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Network-coupled dynamical systems are ubiquitous in
nature and science11, and as a result the control of such
systems has been the focus of a great deal of research
from the nonlinear dynamics and complex networks com-
munities12,13. For instance, the concept of controllabil-
ity of complex networks has been established using con-
trol theory for linear dynamical systems14–18. Signiﬁcant
advances have also been made in the control of several

nonlinear networks-connected dynamical systems19–23. A
particularly important family of network-coupled non-
linear dynamical systems that plays an important role
in modeling phenomena ranging from synchronization of
power grids24 to cardiac excitation25 is networks of cou-
pled oscillators26. Control of coupled oscillator networks
has also garnered signiﬁcant attention recently27,28. In
a recent publication we presented a nonlinear dynamics-
based method for controlling networks of coupled phase
oscillators9 – speciﬁcally for attaining full frequency syn-
chronization, i.e., consensus.
In this paper we extend
this control method to a more general and more com-
plex family of coupled oscillator systems and explore its
eﬀectiveness in this more complicated scenario.

Limit-cycle oscillators hold an important place in the
history of nonlinear science10. Here we consider a net-
work of N coupled Landau-Stuart oscillators zn, i =
1 . . . , N , whose dynamics are governed by the following
system of N nonlinear, complex diﬀerential equations:

˙zn = zn(1 − |zn|2 + iωn) + K

Anm(zm − zn).

N(cid:88)

m=1

In Eq (1), zn ∈ C describes the complex state of oscil-
lator n, ωn is the natural frequency of oscillator n, K
is the global coupling strength, and [Anm] is the adja-
cency matrix that encodes the network structure such
that Anm = 1 if a link exists between nodes n and m.
(We consider here for simplicity the case of undirected
networks such that AT = A.) Interpreting the state of
each oscillator zn as a phase θn and amplitude ρn, such
that zn = ρneiψn, the dynamics of Eq. (1) can be written
in terms of the evolutions of θn and ρn:

representing a natural generalization of the classical Ku-
ramoto phase oscillator model29.

Although some novel dynamical phenomena besides
second-order phase transitions between incoherence and
synchronization have recently been observed in simple
Kuramoto phase oscillator networks30–32, the addition of
an amplitude for each oscillator in Eq. (1) gives rise to
a plethora of more robust dynamical phenomena, includ-
ing amplitude death, period-doubling cascades enroute to
chaos, extensive chaos, cluster states, and hysteresis33–36.
Given the increase in complexity of the dynamics of limit-
cycle oscillators in comparison to phase oscillators, a nat-
ural question arises in the control of limit-cycle oscillator
networks. Can consensus still be reached in the case of
limit cycle oscillator networks? Do the methods used
to attain consensus in phase oscillator networks extend
to the limit-cycle oscillator networks? In this paper, we
address these questions.

We begin by extending the control method presented
in Ref.9 to the limit-cycle oscillator dynamics given in
Eq. (1). In fact, we present two distinct types of control.
In type I control prefer larger amplitudes, driving oscilla-
tors to the edge of the complex unit circle. In the second
type we make no such preference, allowing for smaller
amplitudes in the target state. We demonstrate the util-
ity of both control types, and discuss the eﬀect that each
control type has on the macroscopic order parameters of
the system.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In Sec. II we present the control method.
In Sec. III
we present numerical examples of both control methods
applied to random networks. In Sec. IV we brieﬂy discuss
the failures of the method. Finally, in Sec. V we conclude
with a discussion of our results.

II. CONTROL METHOD

We begin by extending the control method present
in Ref.9 to the network-coupled Landau-Stuart model
given in Eq. (1). We emphasize that our goal is to
achieve a fully frequency-synchronized state character-
ized by ˙θ1 = ··· = ˙θN . We propose a simple linear
feedback-type controller, adding to the right-hand-side
of Eq. (1) a control term fn = Fn(z∗

˙zn = zn(1 − |zn|2 + iωn) + K

n − zn), obtaining

where Fn represents the control gain or strength applied
to oscillator n and z∗
n is the target state for
oscillator n. In particular, Fn > 0 corresponds to some
amount of control applied to oscillator n. The set of
target states z∗
n will be determined below. In polar rep-
resentation, the addition of the control term results in

We note that, for any ﬁnite combinations of frequencies
ωn, coupling strength K, and network structure [Anm], a
suﬃciently large collection of control gains Fn results in
the formation of a stable ﬁxed point at zn = z∗
n. Our goal
is to identify which oscillators require control (for which
we will set Fn > 0), and which oscillators do not require
control (for which we will set Fn = 0). To determine the
control required we will ﬁrst identify the target state z∗
n,
then identify which oscillators require control.

A. Target states

neiθ∗

n = ρ∗

We begin by ﬁnding the target states z∗

n for
each oscillator. To do so, we consider the equations of
motion without control and search for a suitable steady-
state. We assume that in the absence of control the sys-
tem is not fully synchronized, an thus a stable ﬁxed point
of Eq. (1) does not exist. The target state will therefore
represent the closest state to a ﬁxed point which can be
stabilized with control.

Motivated by numerical exploration we present later,
we will derive two diﬀerent target states corresponding
to two diﬀerent control methods. For the ﬁrst type, we
assume that in addition to frequency synchronization, we
wish to maintain a large amplitude for each oscillator,
ρn ≈ 1.
n of
each target state equal to one, and focus on ﬁnding an
equilibrium of Eq. (2). For simplicity we linearize the sine
term in Eq. (2), yielding an equilibrium characterized by

are deﬁned Lnm = δnmkn − Anm, where kn =(cid:80)

where L is the network Laplacian matrix whose entries
m Anm
is the degree of node n. Although L is singular (due
to the fact that each row sums to zero), this equa-
tion can be solved using the Moore-Penrose pseudoin-
verse37. Speciﬁcally, given the eigenvalue decomposition
L = V T ΛV , whose eigenvalues can be ordered 0 = λ1 <
λ2 ≤ ··· ≤ λN such that Λ = diag(λ1, λ2, . . . , λN ) and

the columns of V are given by the eigenvectors of L,
the pseudoinverse of L is given by L† = V T Λ†V , where
Λ† = diag(0, λ−1
N ). Applying the pseudoinverse
to Eq. (8), we obtain

2 , . . . , λ−1

θ∗ = K−1L†ω.

(9)

Combined with unit target amplitudes, we obtain the
target states z∗

n for type I control.

n = eiθ∗

For the second type of target state, we relax the goal of
driving oscillators to a large amplitude and therefore aim
to ﬁnd an approximate equilibrium of both Eqs. (2) and
(3). We begin by assuming that a given set of steady-
state amplitudes ρ∗
n are given, in which case an equilib-
rium of Eq. (2) after linearizing the sine term is charac-
terized by

where (cid:98)L(ρ∗) is the Laplacian matrix corresponding to

In vector notation Eq. (10) can be

0 = ω − K(cid:98)L(ρ∗)θ∗,

Equation (11) can be solved similarly as Eq. (8) by apply-

ing the pseudoinverse, however, since (cid:98)L(ρ∗) is not nec-
singular value decomposition. Speciﬁcally, if (cid:98)L(ρ∗) =

essarily symmetric, its pseudoinverse is deﬁned by the

U T ΣV , where Σ = diag(σ1, . . . , σN ) is populated by
the real, nonnegative singular values 0 = σ1 < σ2 ≤

lated by the left- and right-singular vectors, the pseu-
Σ† = diag(0, σ−1

be solve consistently with Eq. (12), which can be done
iteratively. Speciﬁcally, we initialize θ∗ = 0 and ρ∗ =
1 proceed iteratively. First, we obtain the next set of
phases using Eq. (12), then solve Eq. (13) using Newton’s
method. Repeating this process, we converge onto our

B. Control identiﬁcation

We now proceed to the question of identifying the os-
cillators that require control, assuming that target states
z∗
n have been computed as described above, either in the
type I or II case. Assuming that the target state rep-
resents a ﬁxed point of Eqs. (2) and (3), its stability is
indicated by the spectrum of the Jacobian matrix for
the system. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁxed point is stable if the
real-part of the eigenvalues are contained in the left-half
complex plane. Since our goal of consensus coincides with
the stability of this given point, we aim to bound each
eigenvalue to the left-half complex plane. Focusing on
frequency-synchronization, we inspect Eq. (2), whose Ja-
cobian matrix DF is given by

 −K (cid:80)

m(cid:54)=n

(cid:98)Anm(ρ∗) cos(θ∗

m − θ∗
m − θ∗

DFnm =

n) if m = n
n) if m (cid:54)= n
(14)

neiθ∗

n = ρ∗

radius Rn =(cid:80)

Importantly, the rows of DF sum to zero – a property
that can be leveraged to identify any eigenvalues that
may have positive real part and therefore destabilize the
target state. In particular, after evaluating the Jacobian
at the target state z∗
n , we deﬁne for each n a
m(cid:54)=n |DFnm| and a disc Dn as the closed
disc of radius Ri centered at Cn = DFnn. The Gersh-
gorin circles theorem37 ensures that all the eigenvalues
of DF lie within the union of all the Gershgorin discs.
Speciﬁcally, since the rows of DF sum to zero, if each oﬀ-
diagonal entry of a row n is positive, then Rn = −DFnn
and it follows that the nth Gershgorin disc is contained in
the left-half complex plane. However, if any oﬀ-diagonal
entry of a row n is negative, then Rn > −DFnn, allowing
the nth Gershgorin disc to partially enter the right-half
complex plane, yielding the possibility of an eigenvalue
with positive real part and a potential destabilization of
the target state.

By inspecting the Jacobian DF evaluated at the tar-
get state, and speciﬁcally which rows contain negative
oﬀ-diagonal entries, we can identify precisely which os-
cillators require control. In particular, with the addition
of control the Jacobian becomes

series of 10% of the phases θn(t) and their angular velocities

eters |Z(t)| (solid curve) and |R(t)| (dashed curve) are plotted
in panel (c). Control is turned on at t = 10.

application of control we use threshold values (described
above) of ρ = 0.2 and θ = 0.2.

We begin by comparing type I and type II control im-
plemented on an ER network of size N with mean degree
(cid:104)6(cid:105) and set the coupling strength to K = 0.3. We plot
the results of type I and type II control, respectively,
in Figs. 1 and 2, plotting the time series of 10% of the
phases θn(t) in panels (a) and the corresponding angular
velocities dθn/dt in panels (b). The plotted results are
obtained by discarding a large transient and show the dy-
namics without control (0 ≤ t < 10) and after the control
is turned on (10 ≤ t ≤ 20). The vertical dotted lines at
t = 10 indicate control being turned on. For both type
I and type II control the phases which are initially inco-
herent relax to equilibrium after the control is turned on,
which can also be seen as the angular velocities relax to
zero.

In addition to the time series of the phases and their
angular velocities, we also consider two macroscopic or-
der parameters. The ﬁrst represents the mean ﬁeld of the
limit cycle oscillators:

We also consider the classical Kuramoto order parameter

(17)

The magnitudes of these complex order parameters, |Z|
and |R|, thus give meaningful measures of the network

work of size N = 1000 with mean degree (cid:104)k(cid:105) = 6, and coupling
strength K = 0.3. Time series of 10% of the phases θn(t) and
their angular velocities tθn/dt are plotted in panels (a) and
(b), and the order parameters |Z(t)| (solid curve) and |R(t)|
(dashed curve) are plotted in panel (c). Control is turned
on at t = 10. Natural frequencies are drawn from a uniform
distribution of unit variance.

Speciﬁcally, for each row n with negative oﬀ-diagonal en-
tries, the control gain can be set to Fn > Rn + DFnn,
shifting the nth Gershgorin disc into the left-half complex
plane, stabilizing the network.

n and ρ∗

Before proceeding to numerical examples, we make an
important remark on the identiﬁcation of oscillators that
require control. In particular, the target phases and am-
plitudes θ∗
n represent an approximation to the
ﬁxed point given the expansion of the sine and cosine
terms in Eqs. (2) and (3). In practice we build in a margin
of error when identifying oscillators for control in order
to overcome any inaccuracies induced by these aproxi-
mations. Speciﬁcally, rather than searching for rows with
negative entries of the Jacobian, we set a threshold θ > 0
and identify any oscillator n as requiring control if for any
neighboring oscillator m the entry DFnm/K ≤ θ.

III. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES

We now demonstrate the control method with several
examples on random networks. Speciﬁcally, we use net-
works built using the Erd˝os-Reny´ı (ER) model38, where
connections are created in a network of N nodes in such
a way that, for any given pair of nodes (i, j), a link is
made between nodes i and j with tunable probability p,
resulting in a mean degree of (cid:104)k(cid:105) = p(N − 1). Further-
more, in our simulations we consider oscillators whose
variance, i.e., drawn from the interval [−√
natural frequencies are uniformly distributed with unit
3]. In the

FIG. 3. (Color online) Type I control applied to the same
network as in Figs. 1 and 2 (N = 1000, (cid:104)k(cid:105) = 6) but larger
coupling strength, K = 0.4. Time series of 10% of the phases
θn(t) and their angular velocities tθn/dt are plotted in panels
(a) and (b), and the order parameters |Z(t)| (solid curve)
and |R(t)| (dashed curve) are plotted in panel (c). Control is

synchronization. We also plot in panels (c) of Figs. 1 and
2 the time series of both order parameters |Z(t)| (solid
curve) and |R(t)| (dashed curve). As is typically the case
(but does not need to be so), the Kuramoto order pa-
rameter |R(t)| is larger than the order parameter |Z(t)|
due to the fact that ρn ≤ 1 for all n. Interestingly, type I
control enhances the degree of synchronization, as mea-
sured by both |Z(t)| and |R(t)|, however type II control
actually results in a smaller value of both. This can be
explained by inspecting the distributions of target phases
to which the oscillators relax in panels (a). In particular,
type I control results in a distribution of phases that are
clustered relatively close to the mean angle (here shifted
to zero), while type II results in a much more uniform dis-
tribution of phases around the whole unit circle, resulting
in a surprisingly low degree of phase synchronization.

In the examples presented in Figs. 1 and 2 the de-
gree of synchronization of the initial state before control
was relatively low, i.e., a signiﬁcant number of oscillators
were incoherent. We now contrast these experiments by
considering the result of applying control to a state with
initiall larger degree of synchronization. For the same
network as used above, we increase the coupling strength
to K = 4, and present the results of applying both type
I and type II control in Figs. 3 and 4. Note that before
application of control the network is signiﬁcantly more
synchronized than for the case of K = 0.3. In both cases
of type I and type II control the network is able to relax
to an equilibrium, however we note an interesting phe-
nomenon with the macroscopic order parameters. In the
case of type I control (Fig. 3), while the order parameter

|Z(t)| increases, the Kuramoto order parameter |R(t)| in
fact decreases. More surprisingly, in the case of type II
control (Fig. 4), both order parameters |Z(t)| decrease
after control in applied. We ﬁnd that this phenomenon
can be attributed the the distribution of phases attained
after control is applied. In particular, in both type I and
type II control the distribution of steady-state phases
can be relatively wide. This is more apparent in the case
of type II control, but is also somewhat true for type I
control.
[Note that several oscillators in Fig. 3(a) relax
near θ ≈ ±π.] Thus, while the control method can be
used to attain consensus in the sense of frequency syn-
chronization, the resulting state may be poorly phase-
synchronized. This eﬀect is curbed primarily in type I
control for the order parameter Z(t) since oscillators are
explicitly driven to a larger amplitude, tending to result
in an increased |Z(t)|.

IV. FAILURE OF THE METHOD

Before closing, we brieﬂy discuss the possible failures
of the control method presented in this paper. While
the method has been by-and-large eﬀective in our ex-
plorations, we have also observed some cases where full
frequency-synchronization is not attained. These failures
deserve a few remarks. First, we note that in our explo-
rations type I is very eﬀective, failing very infrequently.
Second, failures typically correspond to only a handful
of oscillators (in many cases only one or two) remaining
incoherent, and thus a very large fraction of the network
end up in a state of frequency synchronization. Finally,

neiθ∗

n = ρ∗

we note that the likelihood of failure can be mitigated by
modifying the threshold parameters ρ and θ. We em-
phasize that the target states z∗
n which are cen-
tral to the control method are approximations of theoret-
ical equilibria of Eq. 1, and thus it is to be expected that
as this approximation fails, the likelihood of the control
method failing increases. We ﬁnd that the eﬀect of these
inaccuracies can be curbed by increasing these threshold
parameters. We note that our explorations have focused
on the case of ER random networks, and the presence of
more complicated structural patterns in networks could
aﬀect the control method.

V. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have investigated the control of net-
works of limit-cycle oscillators towards full frequency syn-
chronization, i.e., consensus. The proposed method rep-
resents an extension of a method for controlling networks
of phase oscillators9 – now applied to the limit-cycle
counterpart given in Eq. (1). In particular, the method is
based on identifying a target ﬁxed point for the network
and stabilizing this target state via an appropriately-
deﬁned feedback-type control. We proposed two types
of control: type I control uses only the phase dynamics
of the system and drives oscillators to large amplitudes
(i.e., ρn = 1), while type II control uses both the phase
and amplitude dynamics of each oscillator to ﬁnd a target
state.

We have demonstrated the application of both type I
and type II control with numerical examples and studied
the eﬀect that each type has on the macroscopic order pa-
rameters of the network. Surprisingly, the application of
control can, and often does, decrease the degree of phase
synchronization, as measure by the typical Kuramoto
order parameter or it limit-cycle oscillator counterpart,
while attaining strong frequency synchronization. We
ﬁnd that this phenomenon is due to the fact that, in
many cases, the target state to which control drives the
oscillators is relatively widely spread around the unit cir-
cle. Finally, we have included a discussion on the possible
failures of the method. As the determination of the target
state is based on an approximation, it is expected that
as the approximation fails, the likelihood of the control
method failing increases. We note, however, that this
eﬀect can be curbed by modifying threshold parameters
built into the control identiﬁcation process, and in cases
of failure we ﬁnd that only a handful of oscillator remain
desynchronized from the synchronized population.
