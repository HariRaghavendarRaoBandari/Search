Many-Body-Localization Transition : strong multifractality spectrum

at the critical point towards a non-ergodic delocalized phase

For short-ranged disordered quantum models in one dimension, the Many-Body-Localization is
analyzed via the adaptation to the Many-Body context [M. Serbyn, Z. Papic and D.A. Abanin, PRX
5, 041047 (2015)] of the Thouless point of view on the Anderson transition : the question is whether a
local interaction between two long chains is able to reshuﬄe completely the eigenstates (Delocalized
phase with a volume-law entanglement) or whether the hybridization between tensor states remains
limited (Many-Body-Localized Phase with an area-law entanglement). The central object is thus
the level of Hybridization induced by the matrix elements of local operators, as compared with the
diﬀerence of diagonal energies. The multifractal analysis of these matrix elements of local operators
is used to analyze the corresponding statistics of resonances. Our main conclusion is that the critical
point is characterized by the Strong-Multifractality Spectrum f (0 ≤ α ≤ 2) = α
2 , well known in
the context of Anderson Localization in spaces of eﬀective inﬁnite dimensionality, where the size of
the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the volume. As a consequence, the level statistics at
criticality is the closest possible to the Poisson statistics of the Localized phase, and the Delocalized
phase near the critical point is not ergodic.

In disordered quantum systems, the Many-Body-Localization Transition (see the recent reviews [1, 2] and references
therein) can be seen as a phase transition for the energy levels and for the excited eigenstates. In the Ergodic phase
where the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (E.T.H.) [3–7] holds, the energy levels are governed by the Wigner-
Dyson statistics, while the eigenstates display the volume-law entanglement with a prefactor given by the thermal
entropy. In the Many-Body-Localized (MBL) phase, the energy levels are governed by the Poisson statistics, while
the eigenstates display an area-law entanglement [8–12] allowing in particular eﬃcient tensor networks representations
[13–17]. The Strong Disorder Real-Space RG approach (see [18, 19] for reviews) developed initially by Ma-Dasgupta-
Hu [20] and Daniel Fisher [21–23] to construct the ground states of random quantum spin chains, has been extended
for the whole Many-Boy-Localized phase into the Strong Disorder RG procedure for the unitary dynamics [24, 25],
and into the RSRG-X procedure to construct the whole set of excited eigenstates [26–30]. This construction is
possible only because the Many-Body-Localized phase is characterized by an extensive number of emergent localized
conserved operators [33–41]. As a consequence, the Strong Disorder RG breaks down when the MBL transition towards
delocalization is approached, and other types of real-space RG have been proposed for the critical point, based on
the notion of insulating or thermalizing blocks of various sizes [42–44] and are in favor of a direct transition towards
the ergodic phase. Then, as a consequence of the strong-subadditivity property of the entanglement entropy [45], the
critical point itself has to satisfy the E.T.H. property, i.e. the entanglement entropy has to coincide with the thermal
entropy [45]. However, another possibility is that the transition is towards a delocalized non-ergodic phase, i.e. the
entanglement entropy satisﬁes the volume law, but not with the thermal coeﬃcient ﬁxed by the E.T.H. [45, 46]. This
delocalized non-ergodic scenario is supported by the point of view that the MBL transition is somewhat similar to an
Anderson Localization transition in the Hilbert space of ’inﬁnite dimensionality’ as a consequence of the exponential
growth of the size of the Hilbert space with the volume [47–52].
In summary, whereas the Many-Body-Localized
Phase seems nowadays well understood, there remains open issues concerning both the nature of the critical point
and the nature of the delocalized phase (ergodic or non-ergodic) close to the critical point.

To characterize the MBL transition, Reference [53] has proposed recently to adapt to the Many-Body context the
Thouless point of view for the Anderson transition : the question is whether a local interaction between two long
chains is able to reshuﬄe completely the eigenstates or not [53]. This shows that the statistical properties of the
matrix elements of local operators play an essential role [53], as also shown by the adaptation of the Dyson Brownian
motion to Many-Body-Localization models [54, 55]. These studies have also suggested that multifractality is the good
framework to describe these statistical properties [53–55]. The goal of the present work is thus to analyze in details
the problem of the coupling between two longs chains via the multifractal formalism.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section I, the coupling of two long chains via some local operator is described to
introduce the notations. In Section II, the statistical properties of the matrix elements of local operators are analyzed
via the multifractal formalism. In Section III, the consequences for the multifractal statistics of the Hybridization
Ratios are derived. The conclusions are summarized in section IV.

I. ANALYSIS OF THE LOCAL COUPLING BETWEEN TWO LARGE BLOCKS

A.

Eﬀects of the local coupling in the tensor-basis

Let us consider a disordered quantum spin chain model with nearest-neighbor interactions, with two independent
large blocks of length N : the block A contains N quantum spins i = 1, .., N and M = 2N energy levels ai, while the
block B contains N quantum spins j = N + 1, .., 2N and M = 2N energy levels bi, with the corresponding spectral
decomposition

The level spacing in each block is given at exponential level by the inverse of the size of the Hilbert space

∆A = ∆B =

(1)

(2)

Let us now introduce the local coupling between the spins i = N and J = N + 1 that are at the boundaries of the

two blocks. To be more concrete, let us consider the explicit case of the coupling via the local magnetization

V AB = JABσx

N σx

can be analyzed in the tensor-basis with i = 1, .., M and j = 1, .., M .

The level of hybridization between two tensor states (ij 6= i′j ′) is determined by the ratio

i′j ′,i′j ′ ) − (ai + bj + V AB

(10)

3

as follows : when the ratio is small Ri′j ′,ij ≪ 1, the hybridization between the two tensor states (ij 6= i′j ′) is small,
when the ratio is large Ri′j ′,ij ≫ 1, the hybridization between the two tensor states (ij 6= i′j ′) is large.

For a given tensor-state

|φi0j0 >≡ |ai0 > ×|bj0 >

(11)

one thus needs to consider the hybridization ratios Ri0j0,ij with all other tensor states |φij > in the Hilbert space
of size M = M 2. The question of the Many-Body-Localization is related to the statistics of these M hybridization
ratios Ri0j0,ij as follows :

(i) in the Many-Body-Localized phase, where the entanglement between the two blocks satisﬁes the one-dimensional
area-law and thus remains ﬁnite, an eigenstate |ψ > of the full Hamiltonian H = HA + HB + V AB can be well
approximated by a Schmidt decomposition involving only a ﬁnite sum of tensor product states. This means that only
a ﬁnite number of hybridization ratios Ri0j0,ij are ﬁnite, while all other are negligible.

(ii) in the Many-Body-Delocalized phase, where the entanglement follows the volume law, an eigenstate |ψ > of
H = HA + HB + V AB involves a diverging number of nearly equivalent terms in the Schmidt decomposition, i.e.
a diverging number of tensor states |φij >. This requires that a diverging number of hybridization ratios do not
converge towards zero.

In summary, the behavior of the entanglement Schmidt decomposition of an eigenstate of H = HA + HB + V AB is
directly related to the statistics of the hybridization ratios Ri0j0,ij of Eq. 9, and thus to the statistics of the matrix
elements of local operators appearing in the oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements V AB

i0j0,ij of Eq. 8.

II. MULTIFRACTAL STATISTICS FOR MATRIX ELEMENTS OF LOCAL OPERATORS

A.

Local magnetization as an example of local operator

For the block A containing N sites with an Hilbert space of size M = 2N , the matrix elements of the magnetization

σz
N

N |am >

(12)

are of random sign. To characterize their modulus, it is thus convenient to introduce the corresponding Edwards-
Anderson matrix

qEA

N |am > |2 =< an|σz

N |am >< am|σz

N |an >

(13)

that has the nice property to be doubly stochastic [55], i.e. it is a square matrix of size M × M of non-negative real
numbers, where the sums over any row or any column is unity

as a consequence of the completeness identity

i )2 = 1. Doubly stochastic matrices appear very often in quantum mechanics (see
and the Pauli matrix identity (σz
for instance [7, 56, 57]). The normalization of Eq. 14 means that the m = 1, 2, .., M values qEA
nm can be interpreted as
M random weights normalized to unity, so that the multifractal formalism is very appropriate to characterize their
statistics as we now describe.

B. Multifractal exponents τ (q)

After its introduction in ﬂuid dynamics in order to characterize the statistical properties of turbulence (see the
book [58] and references therein), the notion of multifractality has turned out to be relevant in many areas of physics
(see for instance [59–65]), in particular at critical points of disordered models like Anderson localization transitions

[66, 67] or in random classical spin models [68–76]. More recently, the wavefunctions of manybody quantum systems
have been analyzed via multifractality for ground states in pure quantum spin models [77–90], as well as for excited
states in MBL models [10, 91–93].

Here, we wish to analyze the statistics of the matrix elements < φn|σz

N |φm > where n is ﬁxed and where m =
1, 2, .., M goes over the whole Hilbert space of size M = 2N for the block A via the multifractal formalism as follows.

Among the M eigenstates, the number NM (α) of eigenstates m that have with n a matrix element of order

The saddle-point calculus in α of the moments of Eq. 16

M f (α)

yields

Yq(M ) ≃Z dα M f (α) M −qα ∝ M −τ (q)

− τ (q) = maxα (f (α) − qα)

i.e. τ (q) and f (α) are related via the Legendre transform

τ (q) + f (α) = qα
τ ′(q) = α
f ′(α) = q

(23)

For q = 0, Eq. 16 simply measures the size of the Hilbert space Y0(M ) = M corresponding to τ (0) = −1 and
D(0) = 1 and to f (α0) = 1 : this means that there exists an extensive number O(M ) of states having a matrix
element | < φn|σz

is called the ’information dimension’ that characterizes the Shannon entropy of Eq. 19.

(26)

3.

Smallest exponent α+∞ for q → +∞

In the limit q → +∞, Eq. 16 is dominated by the conﬁgurations having the biggest possible matrix element

N |φm > |max , and thus the smallest exponent α+∞

α+∞ = −

ln | < φn|σz

N |φm > |2
ln M

max

= D(+∞)

(27)

leading to Yq→+∞ ≃ M −qα+∞ , since the corresponding singularity spectrum vanishes f (α+∞) = 0. Note that here
we consider the typical multifractal spectrum satisfying f (α) ≥ 0, that describes the statistics that are found in a
typical sample (and not the average multifractal spectrum f av(α) that keeps some meaning in the negative region
f av(α) < 0 in order to describe events that happen in rare samples, see [67] for more details in the context of the
Anderson transitions).

E.

Simple examples of multifractal spectra

As a comparison, one should keep in mind that the monofractal spectrum corresponds to

f Mono(α) = δ(α − 1)
τ Mono(q) = (q − 1)

(28)

1.

Example of the Weak Multifractality Gaussian spectrum

The Weak Multifractality spectrum depending on the small parameter ǫ is a small deformation of the monofractal

limit of Eq. 28

f W eak(α) = 1 −

(α − (1 + ǫ))2

4ǫ

So it is Gaussian around the typical value α0 = 1 + ǫ and corresponds to the exponents

τ W eak(q) = (q − 1)(1 − ǫq)

(29)

(30)

This Weak Multifractality spectrum appears in particular at Anderson Localization Transition just above d = 2 [67].

for q ≥

(32)

This Strong Multifractality spectrum appears in particular at Anderson Localization Transition in the limit of inﬁnite
dimension d → +∞ [67] or in related long-ranged power-law hoppings in one-dimension [94–108].

In the following, we will ﬁnd that this Strong Multifractality Spectrum shows up again. The physical reason is
that the MBL transition in one-dimension is somewhat similar to the Anderson Localization transition in the Hilbert
space whose geometry is of ’inﬁnite dimensionality’ like trees, as a consequence of the exponential growth M = 2N of
the size of the Hilbert space with the length N , as discussed in [47–52].

F.

Local operators for random eigenfunctions in Hilbert space

For random eigenfunctions in the Hilbert space, as in the Gaussian Random Matrix Ensemble, the matrix elements
of the local magnetization display all the same scaling (only the numerical prefactor changes between diagonal and
oﬀ-diagonal results [55])

| < φn|σz

N |φm > |2 ∝

1
M

(33)

More generally, the matrix elements of local operators are associated to the simple monofractal spectrum of Eq. 28

f GOE(α) = f mono(α) = δ(α − 1)

(34)

G. Local operators for Many-Body-Localized eigenfunctions

For Many-Body-Localized eigenfunctions characterized by some ﬁnite localization length ξ, the matrix elements

| < φn|σz

N |φm > |2 with a given state |φn > are expected to be :

(i) ﬁnite and of order 2−ξ for a ﬁnite number 2ξ of other eigenstates m (i.e. each region of length ξ can be considered
as ergodic within its reduce Hilbert space of size 2ξ ). In the multifractal language, this means that the multifractal
spectrum begins at the origin

αloc
q=+∞ = 0 = f (αloc

q=+∞ = 0)

(35)

(ii) exponentially small in N for all other (M − 2ξ) eigenstates [53], i.e. they decay as a power-law with respect
to the size M = 2N of the Hilbert space. To obtain a more precise description, one needs to know the number of
eigenstates M f loc(α) that have a matrix element of order | < φn|σz
N |φm > |2 ∝ M −α, i.e. one needs a multifractal
description. Here it is important to stress the diﬀerence with the Anderson localization in ﬁnite dimension d, where
the exponential localization decay e−L/ξ is not able to compete with the power-law behavior of the level spacing
∆E = 1/Ld. This is why in Anderson localization models, the multifractality appears only at the critical point.

Our conclusion is that the multifractal formalism is needed to characterize the statistics of matrix elements of local
operators in the Many-Body-Localize phase. As a consequence, one expects that it is also needed at the critical point.
And if the delocalized phase is not ergodic with its monofractal spectrum of Eq. 34, the multifractal formalism is also
necessary in the delocalized phase, as for instance for Anderson Localization on trees [109].

III. MULTIFRACTAL ANALYSIS OF THE HYBRIDIZATION RATIOS

A. Multifractal statistics of the coupling V AB

i0 j0 ,ij

The coupling of Eq. 8 directly inherits the multifractal statistics of the matrix-elements < ai0 |σx

N |ai > and
N +1|bj > within each of the two blocks. Indeed the generalized moments read in terms of the size of the global

< bj0|σx



7

(36)

So the number of tensor states (i, j) that have a coupling with the reference state (i0, j0) scaling as |V AB

i0j0,ij| ∼ M−α/2

is described by the same multifractal spectrum f (α) of Eq. 20

N (|V AB

i0j0,ij| ∼ M−α/2) ∝ Mf (α)

(37)

(38)

B. Hybridization Ratio between two consecutive energy levels

Following Ref. [53], let us ﬁrst discuss the case of two consecutive levels separated by the level spacing

∆Ei0j0,next =

1
M

between two consecutive levels. The coupling between these two levels is governed by the typical exponent αq=0 (Eq.
24) in our present multifractal formalism

i0j0,next| ∼ M−α0/2
So the Hybridization ratio between two consecutive levels scales as

|V AB

|V AB
i0j0,next|
∆Ei0j0,next

= M1−α0/2

(39)

(40)

The scaling of Eq. 40 is actually representative of all states having an energy diﬀerence scaling as ∆Ei0j0,i,j ∝ 1

M .
So the Many-Body-Localized phase can be stable only if Eq. 40 decays with the scale. This leads to the following
bound for the typical exponent

Using M = M 2 = 22N , the exponent κ characterizing the Many-Body-Localized phase in Ref.
κ = (αloc

0 − 2) ln 2 in our present multifractal description.

In the GOE monofractal case of Eq. 34 where

αloc

0 > 2

the Ratio of Eq. 40 diverges as

αGOE

0

= 1

RGOE

ab,next = M1/2

(41)

[53] corresponds to

(42)

(43)

C. Hybridization Ratio with the state having the biggest oﬀ-diagonal coupling

Another interesting special case is the state (i, j) having the biggest oﬀ-diagonal coupling with the state (i0, j0),

which is governed by the exponent αq=∞ of Eq. 27 in our present multifractal formalism

Vmax = max(ij)(|V AB

i0j0,ij|) ∼ M− α∞

2

(44)

The energy diﬀerence ∆E between these two levels is ﬁnite of order M0, so that the Hybridization Ratio keeps the
same behavior as Eq. 44

R =

Vmax
∆E

∼ M− α∞

2

(45)

In the Many-Body-Localized phase, this Hybridization Ratio with the maximally-coupled state is expected to be

ﬁnite in agreement with Eq. 35

αloc
q=+∞ = 0 = f (αloc

q=+∞ = 0)

(46)

8

D. Multifractal statistics of the Hybridization Ratio Ri0 j0 ,ij

After the two extreme cases just described, let us now discuss the general case where the two levels are separated
M , the energy diﬀerence

by Mx intermediate levels with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. Taking into account the level spacing ∆E = 1
scales as

∆Ei0j0,ij =

Mx
M

=

1

M1−x

(47)

So the value x = 0 corresponds to the level-spacing scaling, while the value x = 1 corresponds to ﬁnite energy
diﬀerence. With a numbering n = 1, .., M of energy levels, the change of variables n = M x yields dn = (ln M )M xdx,
i.e. at leading order without the logarithmic factor, the number of levels corresponding to a given exponent x is M xdx.
From the multifractal statistics of the coupling Vi0j0,ij = M−α/2, one thus obtains that the number of Hybridization
ratios Ri0j0,ij = Vi0j0,ij/∆Ei0j0,ij scaling as Ri0j0,ij ∼ M− γ

that deﬁnes the multifractal spectrum F (γ) associated to the Hybridization Ratio for −2 ≤ γ ≤ +∞.

2 θ(γ ≤ α ≤ γ + 2) ≡ MF (γ)

(48)

E. Number of levels N mixing with a non-vanishing Hybridization Ratio

In Eq. 48, the Hybridization Ratios that do not vanish with the size M are described by the negative region
−2 ≤ γ ≤ 0. The corresponding number of states (ij) that will strongly mix with the reference state (i0, j0) thus
reads

Since the last integral is dominated by the boundary γ = 0, one obtains

dαMf (α)− α

2 = MF (γ=0)

(49)

(50)

in terms of the value F (γ = 0) at γ = 0 of the multifractal spectrum of Eq. 48.

In Eq. 50, one has to do the same saddle-point calculation as in Eq. 21 for q = 1/2, but it is important to discuss

where the saddle point αq=1/2 is within the region [0, 2].

F. Delocalized phase

In the Delocalized phase, one expects that the saddle point αq=1/2 is in the interval 0 < αq=1/2 < 2. Then Eq. 21

yields using Eq. 18

i.e. the growth of the number of mixing levels is governed by

N deloc

mixing ≃ M−τ (q=1/2) = M

D(q=1/2)

2

∼ MF (γ=0)

F deloc(γ = 0) =

Ddeloc(q = 1/2)

> 0

For instance for the GOE case where DGOE(q = 1/2) = 1 (Eq. 34), one obtains the scaling

N GOE

mixing ≃ M

1

2 = M

which coincides with the maximal number of terms in the Schmidt decomposition of an eigenstate.

(51)

(52)

(53)

G. Many-Body-Localized phase

In the Many-Body-Localized phase, one expects that the number of mixing N mixing remains ﬁnite

F loc(γ = 0) = 0

9

(54)

and that the saddle-point evaluation of Eq. 50 is entirely due to the origin α = 0 = f loc(0) (Eq. 35) as a consequence
of the eﬀective Hilbert space of size 2ξ. This requirement that the saddle-point of Eq. 50 is at the origin means that

and that the multifractal spectrum satisﬁes the strict inequality

αloc

q=1/2 = 0

f loc(α) <

α
2

for 0 < α ≤ 2

H. Critical point

(55)

(56)

At the critical point between the Many-Body-Localized phase, and the delocalized phase, we expect that the
number of mixing N mixing still remains ﬁnite, but that the integral of Eq. 50 has contributions from the whole
interval 0 ≤ α ≤ 2. This can happen only for the following multifractal spectrum

that coincides with the known Strong Multifractality spectrum of Eq. 31 with the exponents

f criti(α) =

matches the delocalized result of Eq. 51. As a consequence, the delocalized phase near the critical point is far from
the ergodic result of Eq. 53 based on DGOE(q = 1/2) = 1.

The typical value

coincides with the limit of stability of the Many-Body-Localized phase with respect to the next energy level (Eq. 41).

For the hybridization Ratio, the multifractal spectrum of Eq. 48 reads at criticality

F criti(γ) =

θ(−2 ≤ γ ≤ 2)

where the negative region F criti(γ) < 0 for γ < 0 can only describe rare events that do not occur in a typical sample,
while the positive region F criti(γ) ≥ 0 that describes what happens in a typical sample

also coincides with the Strong Multifractal spectrum of Eq. 31.

In this article, the local coupling between two long disordered quantum spin chains has been analyzed via the multi-

completely the eigenstates, as expected in the Delocalized phase with a volume-law entanglement, or whether the
hybridization between tensor states remains limited, as expected in the Many-Body-Localized Phase with an area-law
entanglement. Our main conclusion is that the critical point is characterized by the Strong-Multifractality Spectrum
f (0 ≤ α ≤ 2) = α
2 , well known in the context of Anderson Localization in spaces of eﬀective inﬁnite dimensionality,
where the size of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the volume. Among the various consequences, the most
important are :

(i) the statistics of energy levels at criticality is the closest possible to the Poisson statistics of the Localized phase,

a possibility that has been studied via singular perturbation theory in [110].

(ii) the delocalized phase near the critical point is not ergodic.
(iii) various observables are expected to display essential singularities near the transition (see the recent discussion
on models of eﬀective inﬁnite dimensionality [52] and references therein) and to involve some corresponding speciﬁc
form of ﬁnite-size-scaling in the critical region [50].
