Abstract

We further discuss properties of a simple model, which allows existence
of domain walls with orientational moduli, localized on them. We review
an analytic solution of such a model and discuss properties of that solution
in a context of previous results. We discuss an existence of one-dimensional
domain walls, localized on two-dimensional ones, and construct a correspond-
ing eﬀective action. Then in low-energy limit, which is O(3) sigma-model,
we discuss existence of skyrmions, localized on domain walls, and provide a
solution for a skyrmion conﬁguration, based on the analogy with instantons.
We perform a symmetry analysis of the initial model and low-energy theory
on the domain wall world volume.

Introduction

In certain ﬁeld theories existence of non-Abelian moduli, localized on topo-
logical defects, is possible; this discovery was ﬁrst made for Super-Yang-Mills
theories with matter for non-Abelian topological strings [1, 2, 3]. Then, in-
spired by a work [4] on cosmic strings, a similar construction was developed
[5, 6] for domain walls. In [6] existence of such a construction was proved by
numerical calculations, and its low-energy dynamics - translational moduli
of the domain wall and rotational non-Abelian moduli, localized on the wall
- was analysed.

Here we expand the previous results on non-Abelian moduli in several
directions. First we establish correspondence between recently found analytic
solution [7] of the domain wall proﬁle, which supports non-Abelian moduli,
and previous results from [6], discussing the possibility to compare numeric
and analytic solutions and the energies of lowest modes. Then we explore
a simpliﬁed case of the same model, where O(3) symmetry of it is replaced
by Z2 and there are only two scalar ﬁelds, one of which creates a domain
wall and another one gets a non-zero expectation value on it only. We ﬁnd
that such a localized ﬁeld can have a domain wall by itself, which in low-
energy limit behaves as a one dimensional string-like object, localized on a
two-dimensional surface. We discuss its properties and low-energy dynamics,
deriving a corresponding eﬀective action.

Then in a construction which supports non-Abelian moduli, described by
an O(3) sigma-model, we discuss the possibility of existence of skyrmions
of a type which is usually explored in condensed matter physics, and give a
solution for such a skyrmion, based on the analogy with instantons.

Both for the initial model and the model of non-Abelian moduli on the
domain wall we perform a symmetry analysis, keeping in mind possible ap-
plications of this method to more complex problems. The systems under
consideration are very convenient for testing this method, since they allow
us to compare its results with some of the known answers, and at the same
time allow to consider a well-known set-up from a new viewpoint. Review of
the symmetry analysis method is provided.

Paper is organized as follows: section 2 reviews construction of moduli
on domain walls, section 3 discusses an analytical solution of such a system,
conditions of its existence and its properties, comparing it with the previous
results in [6], section 4 describes one-dimensional wall, localized on a two-
dimensional one, and in section 5 skyrmion, localized on a domain wall, is

1

constructed.
In sections 2 and 5 we provide a symmetry analysis of the
systems under consideration, and Appendix is devoted to the review of the
method of symmetry analysis.

2 Moduli on a domain wall

L0 =

∂µϕ∂µϕ − V (ϕ),

Let us review the construction [5, 6] of moduli on domain wall. First consider
a model with a real scalar ﬁeld, described by the Lagrangian
V (ϕ) = λ(ϕ2 − v2)2.

(1)
It has a Z2 symmetry (ϕ → −ϕ) which is spontaneously broken in the
vacuum, where ϕ can be equal to v or −v. So this model supports domain
walls created in the region which connects two vacua. Let us assume that
a wall is parallel to the (x, y) plane and ϕ = ±v for z = ∓∞ (of course,
the inverse case is also possible). Then the solution for ϕ can be found
analytically

(cid:104) mϕ

(cid:105)

ϕ(z) = −v tanh

(z − z0)

,

(2)

where mϕ =

√
8λv2 is the mass of the ϕ ﬁeld and z0 is the wall center.

2

Then let us add to the above model a triplet of ﬁelds χi, i = 1, 2, 3,

described by the Lagrangian

Lχ =

U (ϕ, χi) = γ(cid:2)(ϕ2 − µ2)χiχi + β(χiχi)2(cid:3) ,

∂µχi∂µχi − U (χ, ϕ),

1
2

v2 > µ2,

(3)
so the new model has the Lagrangian L = L0 + Lχ. Then for a choice of
parameters1 for which the vacua are given by ϕ2 = v2, χi = 0, we still can
have a domain wall, connecting these two vacua, and χ, getting a non-zero
expectation value only inside of that wall. Since some energy in the wall is
taken by the kinetic term of χ and still the total energy should be smaller
than without χ condensation, kinetic term of ϕ should be smaller and the
transition region between vacua (i.e. the wall) should become wider.

1For more details about constraints on the set of parameters and stability of the solution

under consideration see [6, 7, 8].

2

To get a domain wall solution explicitly, we need Euler-Lagrange equa-

tions, corresponding to L:(cid:40)ϕ(cid:48)(cid:48) = 4λϕ(ϕ2 − v2) + 2γχ2ϕ,

χi (cid:48)(cid:48) = 2γ(ϕ2 − µ2)χi + 4βγχ2χi.

(4)

The solution which minimizes domain wall energy is degenerate and still
has an O(3) symmetry of the Lagrangian (3):
in all points of the physical
space all orientations in the target space will have the same energy, as far as
χiχi is equal to the value, determined by the energy minimization, i.e. the
live on sphere S2. So we can ﬁnd that solution, ﬁxing orientation of χ in
target space everywhere, for example, making only one component χ3 being-
non-zero and denoting it just as χ; corresponding system of Euler-Lagrange
equations will be just (4) with χi = χ, and we’ll also refer to it as (4). It
possesses the ﬁrst integral

(cid:19)2 − U [ϕ(z), χ(z)] − V [ϕ(z), χ(z)].

(5)

Solution of (4) with domain wall, created by ϕ, and χ, localized on it,
was obtained in [6]. After energy-minimizing conﬁguration was obtain, we
can restore the O(3) symmetry of the χ ﬁeld, allowing its position in target
space to depend on the space-time coordinates on the wall, while χiχi is
still determined by the energy-minimization and so localized on sphere S2
in target space.
In this way we get non-Abelian moduli on domain wall.
Corresponding eﬀective Lagrangian was also derived in [6].

Both in the problem of this section and in the consideration of an ef-
fective theory on domain wall world volume later in this paper we have a
relatively simple Lagrangian, which allows us to see immediately the sym-
metries of the system under consideration and moduli which appear after
breaking of some of these case. But in general this may not be the case.
Some symmetries may be much harder to observe, and systems which don’t
allow a Lagrangian description may be considered as well. For such cases a
mathematical apparatus which allows to analyze symmetries of diﬀerential
equations and integrate them using those symmetries may be a very powerful
tool. Here and later in analysis of skyrmions we will perform such an analy-
sis for the purpose of checking the results, exploration of symmetries which
may be unnoticed by initial investigation and practicing with a method of
symmetry analysis on a simple and well-understood set-up.

3

For details of the method, we refer the reader to the Appendix below,
and to the book by Peter Olver [25]. For heavy-duty calculations that are
often needed in the symmetry analysis, we recommend to use the software
provided with the book [26].

In the case of the system (4), the symmetry analysis renders only the
translational symmetry along the z-direction. So there are no other sym-
metries that we might had missed in our discussion. Quest for generalised
symmetries furnishes no new results either.

3 Analytic solution

The numerical method, developed in [6], can give a solution for any set of
parameters for which such a solution exists. But it is worth looking for an
analytic solution of the same problem, since it can give a result, which is
easier to analyse qualitatively. The price of such simpliﬁcation may be some
loss of generality, since the existence of an analytic solution may impose an
additional constraints to the problem under consideration.

Following [7], let us look to the solution of the system for ϕ ﬁeld in the

same form (2) as it had without additional ﬁeld:
ϕ(z) = −v tanh(αz),

(6)

where the coeﬃcient α, which determines the new width of the wall, is to be
determined later. We also placed the center of the wall at z0 = 0. Then from
the ﬁrst equation in (4) we have:
2λv2 − α2

A2

1

χ2 =

≡

γ

cosh2 αz

cosh2 αz

.

(7)

Plugging in this result into the second equation of (4), we get a polynomial
function of (cosh αz)−1; equality always holds if all the coeﬃcients are zero,
which leads to the following result:

and

α2 = 2γ(v2 − µ2),

α2 = γ(v2 − 2βA2).

(8)

(9)

So for a ﬁeld ϕ, which creates a domain wall, and a ﬁeld χ, localized on
it, we obtained the analytic solution, given by (6) and (7) respectively; α is

4

given by (8). Since α and A are functions of the parameters of the model,
(9) gives one constraint for a set of parameters, under which such a solution
exists.

Note that for ϕ and χ, provided above, the following holds:

ϕ2
v2 +

χ2
A2 = 1,

(10)

i.e. the solution corresponds to an ellipse in (ϕ, χ) plane, where vacua of the
model correspond to the ends of the major axis, where ϕ = ±v and χ = 0.
It is worth noting that the solution (6) for ϕ has the same form as (2),
which was obtained without condensing of χ, but now the width α−1 of the
wall, created by ϕ, is determined by parameters γ and µ from χ part of the
Lagrangian. The derivation above is inverse to the one provided in [9], where
a similar result is produced, starting from an assumption that the solution
in (ϕ, χ) plane has an elliptic shape.

It would be interesting to compare the numerical procedure, applied in
[6], which may help to check the precision of the numerical solution, but this
can’t be cone for the set of parameters in [6], since they don’t satisfy (9).

The main diﬃculty in calculating numerically the domain wall conﬁgu-
ration is the fact that boundary conditions are given only at inﬁnity, and
they correspond to the equilibrium state, i.e.
if we start solving the dif-
ferential equation from it, we’ll always remain at the same state. To omit
this diﬃculty, the following approach was used in [6]: both ﬁelds were slightly
changed from their equilibrium values, which corresponded to the values near
inﬁnity, and then shooting method was used:
initial deﬂection was varied,
until it gave the expected results near the other inﬁnity.

This approach required asymptotycs near inﬁnity, which were obtained
from (4) by leaving only the tirms on the ﬁrst order in ϕ and χ. But for
the solution in (6, 7) this approach won’t work, since variation of ϕ from the
vacuum η ≡ v − ϕ will be of the order of χ2, which is clear from (10). So
the simple asymtotics of [6] don’t work. Of course, it is possible to obtain
the asymptotics directly from the analytic solution [7], but it will be to a
some extent diﬀerent calculation procedure. When we have neither analytical
solution nor ability to simplify (4), a conﬁguration can be found only in
more complicated numerical procedure, involving variation not only ﬁelds,
but their derivatives too.

Another strategy of solving the system (4) numerically may turn out
to be helpful. The form of the analytic solution written down in (6, 7)

5

suggests such a change of variables that the new variable is deﬁned on a
ﬁnite interval. Under this kind of transformation, the vacuum values of the
ﬁelds at inﬁnity become the boundary values at the ends of the said ﬁnite
interval. Speciﬁcally, (4) compels us to try the change of variables 2

z = κ arctan ξ

,

(11)

with κ being a free parameter, and ξ being a new argument deﬁned on
the interval [−1, 1]. However, under this substitution, the equations acquire
singular points at the ends of the interval, even though the desired solutions
stay nonsingular there. Having performed a substitution (11) — or another
transformation to a variable belonging to a ﬁnite domain — one can choose
from an arsenal of methods developed to solve the boundary values problem.
In [7], an important problem of energy levels of a ”bare” (with χ = 0
everywhere) domain wall was discussed. Bases on a known spectrum of
modiﬁed P¨oschl-Teller potential it provided a much better estimate than [6],
where the potential was just approximated by a parabolic well. But in general
both results can’t give an exact result for energy levels of a non-”bare” wall,
since condensation of χ also changes the proﬁle of ϕ.

1d wall on a 2d wall

We are still working with the Lagrangian with the ﬁxed orientation of χ in
the target space:

(∂χ)2 − λ(ϕ2 − v2)2 − γ(cid:2)(ϕ2 − µ2)χ2 + βχ4(cid:3) .

Note that χ possesses a Z2 symmetry:

its Lagrangian and equations
of motion are invariant under substitution χ → −χ. So if we have some
conﬁguration of the ﬁelds ϕ and χ, satisfying the equations of motion (4),
conﬁguration with the same ϕ and χ, which has the opposite sign everywhere,
will also satisfy (4). Of course, this is correct for the construction described
above:
if we have a domain wall, created by the ﬁeld ϕ, and a ﬁeld χ,
localized on it, then the solution for χ with opposite sign is possible and will
have exactly the same energy. In particular, this is visible from (7), where χ

is deﬁned up to a sign, but also holds in a more general case, when we don’t
have an analytic solution. Static conﬁguration on the wall breaks this Z2
symmetry, picking one of the two conﬁgurations with the same energy, and
this allows appearance of topological defects.
Let us assume that a ϕ ﬁeld creates a domain wall in (x, y) plane with
the center at z = 0. Then assuming that at y = −∞ we have a solution
with positive χ and for y = +∞ with a negative χ, we’ll have a transition
region between them - a domain wall for χ, localized on a domain wall of ϕ.
A similar construction was considered in [10].

It is clear that in the one-dimensional wall not only the proﬁle of χ, but
also the proﬁle of ϕ will be diﬀerent from the one at inﬁnity. Previously we
showed that non-zero expectation value of the former makes the wall along
z for the latter bigger, but in the transition region of χ in is close to zero, so
here ϕ penetrates deeper and the wall is narrower.

From a bigger scale the wall of ϕ can be considered as a two-dimensional
surface and the wall of χ - as a one-dimensional string, localized on it. Let
us look to the low-energy transitional moduli of it. In a low-energy limit the
proﬁle of the system can be considered as unchanged, but the position of
the string will depend on time and a coordinate x along it. Plugging in this
result into the action of L = L0 + Lχ gives

and analogous expression for ϕ. Here we left only relevant terms (integral
of the potential term will be same since the proﬁle of the domain walls is
the same). Omitting the inessential constants, which are obtained after the
integration of the ﬁrst two terms in (13), we get the following string eﬀective
action:

The second term in (14) should be taken into account due to the fact
noted above: in the one-dimensional wall of χ proﬁle of two-dimensional wall
of ϕ is diﬀerent, so the eﬀective action here is also diﬀerent from the low-
energy domain wall action, derived in [6]. If we a interested in an eﬀective
action of a string on a wall, only the ﬁrst term in (14) should be considered.

5 Skyrmions

Now let us restore the O(3) symmetry of the χ ﬁeld. Magnitude of the
vector (cid:126)χ in the target space in each point of the real space is deﬁned by
energy minimization, but it has a freedom of rotations in target space, so we
can write χi = χ(z)Si(t, x, y). In [6] it was shown that the corresponding
two-dimensional eﬀective action on domain wall is

Topic of skyrmions on a domain wall attracted a considerable attention
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. It is important both from theoretical (see, for
example, interesting results in [18] about noncommuting momenta) viewpoint
and in relation with active experimental research on magnetic skyrmions
[19, 20] and their possible practical applications for data storage. The model
above actually supports skyrmions of the type, common in condensed matter
physics, in a setup very similar to the one, proposed in the pioneering work
[21].

It is convenient to visualize such a defect, imagining a target space po-
sition as a 3-dimensional vector, attached to each point of the domain wall
plane, whose x, y and z components are S1, S2 and S3 respectively. This
representation becomes exact, when target space position represents a spin
vector. Let us introduce spherical coordinates (θ, ψ) in target space and po-
lar coordinates (r, φ) on the plane with r = 0 at the center of the defect. For
spin systems investigated conﬁgurations include the simplest case, depicted
on Figure 1, when vector in target space goes from the north pole in the
center of the defect do the south pole at inﬁnity, while its projection to the
domain wall plain alway goes along the radius-vector. In a more complicated

Topologically the defects we are looking for are the easiest to understand
through stereographic projections of the the real plane of domain wall to a
sphere, where the center of the defect corresponds to one pole and vacuum
at inﬁnity - to the other one. The topologically non-trivial mappings are
possible between real and target space spheres, which can be classiﬁed, using
the winding number

The simplest way to get an exact solution for Si as functions of space
coordinates for a skyrmion is based on it being topologically identical to the
instanton in 1+1 dimensions, when the latter one is constructed in Euclidean
time. Then for a skyrmion with N = 1 which goes from north pole at the
center to the south pole at inﬁnity we can immediately write the answer
[22, 23]:

S1((cid:126)x) =

S3((cid:126)x) =

2((cid:126)x − (cid:126)x0) · (cid:126)y
((cid:126)x − (cid:126)x0)2 + (cid:126)y2 ,
(cid:126)y2 − ((cid:126)x − (cid:126)x0)2
((cid:126)x − (cid:126)x0)2 + (cid:126)y2 ,

S2((cid:126)x) =

2((cid:126)x − (cid:126)x0) × (cid:126)y
((cid:126)x − (cid:126)x0)2 + (cid:126)y2 ,
((cid:126)a × (cid:126)b = a1b2 − a2b1).

(20)

Here (cid:126)x represents coordinates in plane, (cid:126)x0 it the skyrmion center and
vector (cid:126)y deﬁnes orientation and size (|(cid:126)y|) of the defect. These functions for
(cid:126)y = (1, 0) are shown on the Figure 3 both as three diﬀerent components of
S and as three-dimensional vectors on the domain wall plane. We see that
S3 decreases continuously and the regions with positive and negative S1 and
S2 are symmetric with respect to y and x axes respectively.

The skyrmion (20) has four degrees of freedom: two coordinates of the
center, orientation and size. Considering them as functions of time while
keeping the proﬁle of the system ﬁxed, we can derive an appropriate low-
energy eﬀective action in the same way as it was done above for the one-
dimensional domain wall. Since this was done for a very similar model in
[24], we refer reader to it.

Skyrmion solution again gives us a convenient set-up to apply the method
of symmetry analysis. Such a solution was obtained from the system ([22,

11

23]):

∂µSi = −ijkSjµν∂νSk

(21)

with boundary conditions for which vector in target space goes from one pole
at the center of the defect to another pole at inﬁnity.

The system (21) permits for the symmetry group generated by the fol-

lowing operators:

X1 = ∂x
X2 = ∂y
X3 = y ∂x − x ∂y
X4 = x ∂x + y ∂y
X5 = S 1 ∂S 2 − S 2 ∂S 1
X6 = S 2 ∂S 3 − S 3 ∂S 2
X7 = S 3 ∂S 1 − S 1 ∂S 3

The ﬁrst four are responsible for the translational, boost and scaling invari-
ance in the coordinate space, while the three latter — for the rotational
invariance in the target space, see the discussion in Appendix.

6 Conclusions

After reviewing the construction of domain walls with orientational moduli,
localized on them, we compared new results on analytic solutions for such a
system with previous numeric results. Then in a simpliﬁed model with two
scalar ﬁelds, both possessing a Z2 symmetry, we shoved a possibility of one-
dimensional domain walls, localized on two-dimensional ones, and derived a
corresponding eﬀective action. Then for an eﬀective O(3) sigma-model, local-
ized on a domain wall, we considered the possibility of existence of skyrmions
and provided a solution in analogy with the known one for instantons. We
analysed symmetries of the initial model which supports domain walls and
eﬀective low-energy theory of the domain wall world volume.

Appendix A Symmetry analysis

We start out with addressing a general approach to eliminating all continuous
symmetries of a system of diﬀerential equations of the form

X = ξ j(x k, u l) ∂x j + η s(x k, u l) ∂u s

,

j, k = 1, 2 . . . , m ,

l, s = 1, 2, . . . , n .

(23)

Here x j and u l (x j) stand for independent variables and their functions,
respectively.

The form of the symmetry operator (23) indicates that we are seeking so-
called point symmetries — those for which the functions ξ j and η l depend
only on the coordinates x j and functions u l (x j). In principle, nothing should
prohibit us from allowing the functions ξ k and η l to depend on the derivatives
of functions as well. 3 However, in the current paper we limit ourselves to
point symmetries solely.

All the symmetries of a system of diﬀerential equations can be found with
the aid of a general algorithm described in [25]. Being straightforward but
quite lengthy, this algorithms is often implemented by computer packages.
These are especially needed when the system is complicated, i.e., contain a
large number of variables or/and dependent functions, or contains higher-
order derivatives. 4

Oftentimes, the knowledge of symmetries helps to perform integration of
the system of diﬀerential equations. This task is more challenging than the
search for symmetries, and each speciﬁc problem has to be treated uniquely.
Still, various methods exist, of which the most universal one relies on the
employment of diﬀerential invariants of the symmetries, which are the dif-
ferential manifolds on which the operator (26) acts invariantly.

Below we remind the deﬁnition of a continuous symmetry for a given

manifold, and extrapolate the construction to diﬀerential manifolds.

3 Such symmetries (referred to as generalised ) are not necessarily unphysical. A text-
book example of this kind of symmetry having a physical meaning is the conservation of
the Runge-Lenz vector. It can be demonstrated that the conservation of this vector stems
from a generalised symmetry of the Kepler problem.

4 We recommend using the software that comes with the book [26].

The subscript M in the equation (25) serves to emphasise that the expres-
sion X F σ (x k) vanishes only in the points of the manifold.

j, k = 1, . . . , m .

Let r stand for the rank of Wronskian of the system (24):

(cid:18) ∂ F σ

(cid:19)

∂ x k

r = rank

.

(27)

When r = s , the system is said to have a full rank, while the manifold is
termed regular. To evaluate (25) in a point of the manifold, we solve (24) for
some r coordinates, i.e., express them through the other m− r coordinates.
Insertion of the so-obtained r expressions into (25) furnishes X F σ (x k) as
functions of the said m − r coordinates.
As an example, one can consider the manifold M0 deﬁned by the equation

M0 : F0 (x, y , z) = e− arctan x/y − x 2 + y 2

z

= 0 .

(28)

It stays invariant under the action of the operator

X0 = y ∂x − x ∂y + z ∂z

,

since

The equation

X0 F0 = −F0

.

X0 I (x) = 0

(31)

renders all the functionally-independent invariants of the operator X0:

I1 = x 2 + y 2

,

I2 = log z − arctan x/y

.

(32)

Any other invariant of X0 can be expressed as a function of those. For
example, the manifold M0 reads as:

M0 :

e I2 − I1 = 0 .

Appendix A.2 Symmetries of diﬀerential manifolds

Let us now introduce, in addition to the independent variables x j, functions
u l (x j) . Their partial derivatives will be denoted as:

j ≡ ∂ u l
p l
∂x j

,

j k ≡ ∂ u l
q l
∂x j ∂x k

,

. . .

(34)

Then a system of diﬀerential equations for the functions u l (x j) and their
derivatives can be treated as a diﬀerential manifold :

M : F σ [x j, u l, p l

j, q l

j k, . . .] = 0

,

σ = 1, 2, . . . , N .

(35)

In order to calculate the action of the symmetry operator

X = ξ j(x k, u l) ∂x j + η s(x k, u l) ∂u s

(36)

on the equations of the system (35), we have to deﬁne its action on the partial
derivatives (34). This requires the construction of the so-called prolongated
operator. When looking for the symmetries of the diﬀerential equation (35) of
the order κ, one ﬁrst has to construct the κ-th prolongation of the symmetry
operator. Such prolongations have the form of

(37c)

While the functions ξ j and η s in (36) are allowed to depend on x j and u l
only, the functions ζ depend on the partial derivatives as well:

j = ζ l
ζ l
ζ l
j k = ζ l

j (ξ j, η s, p l
j)
j, q l
j k (ξ j, η s, p l

j k)

. . .

(38a)

(38b)

(38c)

More importantly, these functions are fully determined by the form of opera-
tor X: given the functions ξ j and η s, one can ﬁnd the prolongated operator.
For convenience of the further derivations, it will be convenient to deﬁne the
covariant derivative as

Then, the ﬁrst and higher prolongations can be calculated using

Dj = ∂x j + p l

j ∂u l

.

j = Dj η l − p l

The result of action of a prolongated operator on the diﬀerential equations
of the system will have the form of a polynomial in variables p l
j k, . . . .
By setting all its coeﬃcients equal to zero, one obtains a system of diﬀeren-
tial equations for the functions ξ j and η s, which are called the determining
equations. In most cases, these equations are easy so solve, and the set of
their solutions determines the full group of the continuous symmetries of the
equation.

j, q l

Let us brieﬂy summarise the steps of the described procedure.

1. For a given set of independent variables and unknown functions, write
down the most general form of the symmetry operator, prolongated up
to the highest order of the derivative in the system.
For instance, the for system (21), the variables and functions are {x 1 ≡
x, x 2 ≡ y} and {S1, S2, S3}, while the symmetry operator, prolongated
once, has the form

2. Act with the prolongated operator on each equation of the system.

For skyrmions, the system reads as:

j = − l s t j k S s p t
p l

k

.

(43)

The result of action of the operator (41) on the functions (43) is
straightforward to obtain, but is too long to present here.

3. Solve (algebraically) the original system of equations for any N partial
derivatives, and substitute these into the expression resulting from the
action of the prolongated operator on the equations (35). See also the
discussion after the equation (27).

4. Obtain the system of determining equations by setting zero all the

that in the preceding step we have already restricted ourselves to the
manifold.

5. Solve the determining equations. This step is usually very technical
but straightforward. The more complicated the system of equations is
and the less symmetries it respects, the more determining equations
can be obtained, and the simpler they are.

Above we assumed the system of N diﬀerential equations to be non-
degenerate, which is often not the case. For example, of the six equa-
tions in the system (43) not all are independent. One can solve four of
them for some partial derivatives, and the other two equations will be
satisﬁed automatically (if one keeps in mind that the functions S l are
deﬁned on a unit sphere):

1 S 1 S 2 + p 1
2 S 1 S 2 − p 1
1 S 1 S 3 − p 1
1 S 2 + p 1

For this reason, one should only analyse four instead of six equations.
The equations (44) can also serve for restricting to the manifold in the
step 3.
