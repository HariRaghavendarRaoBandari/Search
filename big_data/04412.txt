THE EVASIVENESS CONJECTURE AND GRAPHS ON 2p

VERTICES

ANDRÉS ANGEL, JERSON BORJA

Abstract. The Evasiveness conjecture have been proved for properties
of graphs on a prime-power number of vertices and the six vertices case.
The ten vertices case is still unsolved. In this paper we study the size
of the automorphism group of a graph on 2p vertices to estimate the
Euler characteristic of monotone non-evasive graph properties and get
some conditions such graph properties must satisfy. We also do this by
means of Oliver groups and give some lower bounds for the dimension of
the simplicial complex associated to a nontrivial monotone non-evasive
graph property. We apply our results to graphs on ten vertices to get
conditions on potential counterexamples to the evasiveness conjecture
in the ten vertices case.

1. Introduction

A graph property P is a collection of graphs on n vertices that is closed
under isomorphism of graphs. The complexity of P, denoted c(P), is the

questions of the form is {i, j} an edge of G? to an oracle that answers yes

minimum k between 0 and (cid:0)n
or no, in order to determine if G belongs to P. When c(P) = (cid:0)n

2(cid:1) such that in the worst we are forced to ask k
2(cid:1) we say

that the property P is evasive, otherwise P is non-evasive.

We say a graph property P is monotone if it is closed under removal of
edges. The property P is called trivial if it is either empty or is the family

of all subsets of (cid:0)V

2(cid:1), otherwise P is called nontrivial.

The following conjecture was proposed by R. Karp.

The evasiveness conjecture for graph properties: every nontrivial mono-

tone graph property is evasive.

The ingenious approach of Kahn, Saks and Sturtevant [5] permitted to
solve the prime-power case and gave new directions on how to attack various
related problems to the evasiveness conjecture.

In their approach, Kahn et al associate to each nonempty monotone graph
property P a simplicial complex ∆P on the set of two-element subsets of
{1, 2, . . . , n}. A collection of two-elements subset of {1, 2, . . . , n} is a face
of ∆P if and only if that collection corresponds to a graph belonging to P.

By abuse of notation we denote both the graph property and the associated
simplicial complex by P.

The concept of evasiveness can be deﬁned for simplicial complexes in a
similar way to evasiveness of graph properties. In fact, a simplicial complex
K can be deﬁned to be non-evasive in an inductive way as follows. Deﬁne K
to be non-evasive if either K is a single vertex or if there is a vertex v in K
such that both the link lkK(v) and the deletion delK (v) are non-evasive (for
a vertex v in K, the link of v is lkK (v) = {A ⊆ V (K) \ {v} : A ∪ {v} ∈ K}
and the deletion of v is delK (v) = {A ⊆ V \ {v} : A ∈ K}). With either
deﬁnition of non-evasive simplicial complex we have

Theorem 1.1. (Kahn-Saks-Sturtevant, [5]) A non-evasive complex is
collapsible.

The immediate consequence of this theorem is that a non-evasive complex
is Z-acyclic and therefore, Z/p-acyclic for every prime number p. We also
have that the Euler characteristic of an non-evasive simplicial complex is 1.

With the help of results of R. Oliver [9], theorem 1.1 implies

Theorem 1.2. (Kahn-Saks-Sturtevant, [5]) The evasiveness conjecture
is true for properties of graphs on a prime-power number of vertices.

In this paper we study the sizes of automorphism groups of graphs to
estimate χ(P), where P is a monotone property of graphs on 2p vertices
where p is prime. First, for a nonempty monotone property of graphs on n
vertices P we can describe the Euler characteristic of P in the form

χ(P) = X[G]⊆P

(−1)mG−1|[G]|,

where mG is number of edges of G and |[G]| is the size of the isomorphism
class [G]. Then, we describe all graphs on p and 2p vertices G for which p
does not divide |[G]| (section 3).
If we assume P to be non-evasive, then χ(P) = 1 and this implies that P
must contain some of the graphs described in lemma 3.3 (below).

With the use of some Oliver groups and a result of Oliver [9] (theorem 4.1
below), we show that P necessarily has to contain some particular classes of
graphs. We do this for graphs on 2p vertices and for graphs on pr + t vertices
where (pr − 1, t) = 1 (section 4 below). Using this results we can give lower
bounds for the dimension of P nontrivial monotone and non-evasive.
In
the particular case of a nontrivial monotone and non-evasive property P of
graphs on 2p vertices we get that dimP ≥ 4p − 1. This bound improves
in the case of 2p vertices a general lower bound given by Björner for the
dimension of a vertex homogeneous simplicial complex K on a ﬁnite set of
cardinality m with χ(K) = 1 (see [7]).

The applications of our results in the 10 vertices case gives us a reduc-
tion of the problem of evasiveness and leave us with conditions for potential
counterexamples to the evasiveness conjecture in the 10 vertices case.

2. Simplicial complexes, Euler characteristic and

automorphism group of graphs

Let V be a ﬁnite set. An (abstract) simplicial complex on V is a collection
K of subsets of V such that (i) {v} ∈ K for all v ∈ V and (ii) A ∈ K and
B ⊆ A implies B ∈ K. If A ∈ K, A is a face of K. The dimension of A
is |A|−1. When the set of vertices V is a face of K we say that K is a simplex.

The geometric realization of K ,denoted |K| can be construct as follows.
If V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}, identify vi with the standard basis vector ei ∈ Rn,
then |K| is obtained as the union of all convex hulls hAi = conv{ei : vi ∈ A}
for A ∈ K.
If K has fi faces of dimension i, then the Euler characteristic of K is

χ(K) = Xi≥0

(−1)ifi.

The automorphism group of K, denoted Aut(K), is the collection of all
permutations of V which leave K invariant. If Γ is a subgroup of Aut(K),
then Γ acts on |K| by extending linearly the action on vertices. We write
|K|Γ for the ﬁxed points of this action. The space |K|Γ is describe in an
abstract way as follows. Deﬁne a simplicial complex K Γ whose vertices are
the orbits of the action of Γ on V that are faces of K and {A1, A2, . . . , Ar}
is a face of K Γ if and only if A1 ∪ A2 ∪ · · · ∪ Ar is a face of K.
If we identify each vertex Ai of K Γ with the barycenter of |Ai| in |K|, then
the geometric realization of K Γ is just |K|Γ.

If P is a nonempty monotone and non-evasive graph property, then P con-
sidered as a simplicial complex is collapsible and this implies that χ(P) = 1.
Therefore, if χ(P) 6= 1, then P being monotone and nontrivial is evasive.
This suggests the idea of examining the Euler characteristic of monotone
graph properties of graphs on n vertices.

For a given graph G on n vertices let [G] denote its isomorphism class
and for any pair of graphs G, H on n vertices let us write [G] ≤ [H] if and
only if G is isomorphic to some subgraph of H. We can write the Euler
characteristic χ(P) as

χ(P) = X[G]⊆P

(−1)mG−1|[G]|,

where P is supposed to be nonempty, mG represents the number of edges of
the graph G (so that G corresponds to a face of dimension mG − 1 of the
simplicial complex P), |[G]| is the size of the isomorphism class [G] and the
sum is taken over all isomorphism classes of graphs contained in P. The
idea is that in many instances there is a common divisor d > 1 of all the
sizes |[G]| for G ∈ P. As a result, d divides χ(P) so that χ(P) 6= 1 and we
conclude that P is evasive.

4

ANDRÉS ANGEL, JERSON BORJA

Our observation is that if P is nontrivial monotone and non-evasive, then P
must contain some graphs G for which d is not a divisor of |[G]|.

In this paper we are going to use the notation of Harary [3] for comple-

ments, unions and joins of graphs.

For a graph G with vertex set V (G) and edge set E(G), its complement G

has V (G) = V (G) and E(G) = (cid:0)V (G)

2 (cid:1) \ E(G). For graphs G1 and G2 with

V (G1) ∩ V (G1) = ∅, the graph G1 ∪ G2 has V (G1 ∪ G2) = V (G1) ∪ V (G2)
and E(G1 ∪ G2) = E(G1) ∪ E(G2).
If V (G1) ∩ V (G2) = ∅, the join
graph G1 + G2 has V (G1 + G2) = V (G1) ∪ V (G2) and E(G1 + G2) =
E(G1) ∪ E(G2) ∪ {{v1, v2} : v1 ∈ V (G1), v2 ∈ V (G2)}. For instance, K n is
the graph on n vertices without edges and Kn,m = Km + K n. If the graph
G is the union of k connected components isomorphic to a graph H, then G
is denoted by kH.

In order to study the divisors of |[G]|, we observe that |[G]| =

|Aut(G)| ,
where Aut(G) denotes the automorphism group of G. Therefore, we inves-
tigate the divisors of |Aut(G)|.

n!

The following basic properties about automorphism groups can be found

in [3], chapter 14.

Lemma 2.1. (i)If G is a connected graph, then Aut(kG) is isomorphic to
the wreath product Aut(G) ≀ Sk.
(ii) If G1 and G2 are disjoint and connected non-isomorphic graphs, then
Aut(G1 ∪ G2) ∼= Aut(G1) × Aut(G2).
(iii) If no component of G1 is isomorphic to a component of G2, then

Aut(G1 + G2) ∼= Aut(G1) × Aut(G2).

(iv) If G is a graph on n vertices, then the group Aut(G) decomposes as

Aut(G) ∼= (Aut(G1) ≀ Sn1) × · · · × (Aut(Gs) ≀ Sns)

where the Gi’s are the distinct connected components of G and ni is the
number of components of G isomorphic to Gi. If mi is the number of vertices
of Gi, then n = n1m1 + n2m2 + · · · + nsms, Aut(Gi) is isomorphic to a

subgroup of Smi and |Aut(G)| divides Qi ni! · (mi!)ni.

Lemma 2.2. Suppose that a graph G on n vertices has exactly k vertices of
a ﬁxed degree r, where 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Then Aut(G) is isomorphic to a subgroup

of Sk × Sn−k. In particular, (cid:0)n

k(cid:1) divides |[G]|.

This is because every element of Aut(G) preserves the set of vertices of
degree r and also preserves the set of vertices that are not of degree r. Then
|Aut(G)| divides k!(n − k)! and

k!(n−k)! divides |[G]|.

n!

A graph G is called regular if all of its vertices have the same degree. If
such degree is r, we say that G is r-regular. When studying the divisors of

THE EVASIVENESS CONJECTURE AND GRAPHS ON 2p VERTICES

the size of automorphism groups of regular graphs, the following result of N.
Wormald is very useful.

Theorem 2.3. (Wormald, [14]) Let G be a connected r-regular graph on
n vertices, where r > 0. Then |Aut(G)| divides

pβ

rnYp

where the product is taken over all prime numbers p ≤ r − 1 and β is given
by

Xpα≤r−1

pα (cid:23)
(cid:22) n − 2

Corollary 2.4. In the hypothesis of theorem 2.3, if r < 3, then |Aut(G)|
divides rn.

3. Graphs on p and 2p vertices

In this section we describe all graphs G on p vertices and also on 2p ver-
tices for which p is not a divisor of |[G]|. We assume that p is an odd prime.
First, we deal with graphs on p vertices.

In the hypothesis of lemma 2.2 we have that (cid:0)p
prime, p divides (cid:0)p

k(cid:1) divides |[G]|. Since p is
k(cid:1) for 0 < k < p so the only cases in which p may not be

a divisor of |[G]| are k = p (G is a regular graph) and k = 0 (there are no
vertices of degree r in G). When we vary the degree r, we conclude that if
p does not divide |[G]|, then G is regular.

Lemma 3.1. If G is a graph on p vertices and p does not divide |[G]|, then
G is a regular graph.

p!

Since |[G]| =

|Aut(G)| , we have that p does not divide |[G]| if and only if p
divides |Aut(G)|, which means that Aut(G) contains an element of order p.
The elements of order p in the symmetric group Sp are precisely the p-cycles.
We assume, without lost of generality, that the p-cycle σ = (01 · · · p − 1) is
an automorphism of G, where the vertices 0, 1, . . . , p − 1 are regarded as the
ﬁnite ﬁeld Fp.

Let us suppose that G is not the graph Kp.

If the edge {r, s} is in G
where r < s, reorder the p-cycle if necessary to assume that r = 0. Thus, we
can assume that the edge {0, s} is in G. The (s − 1)-th power of the p-cycle
σ, σs−1 = (0 s 2s · · · (p − 1)s), is again a p-cycle and an automorphism of G.
We ﬁnd that G contains the edges {0, s}, {s, 2s}, {2s, 3s}, . . . , {(p − 1)s, 0}.
These set of edges form a cycle graph of length p that is a subgraph of G
and that we denote C(s). With this notation we have C(s) = C((p − 1)s).
Remember that the vertices 0, 1, . . . , p − 1 are the elements of Fp and since

Figure 1. C(2), p = 7, σ = (0123456).

(p − 1)s = −s = p − s, we get C(s) = C(p − s). In ﬁgure 1 we illustrate the
example for p = 7, s = 2, σ = (0123456), C(2) = C(5).

Every element s ∈ {1, 2, . . . , (p − 1)/2} such that {0, s} ∈ G deter-
mines a cycle graph C(s). Now, suppose that {0, s}, {0, r} are in G, where
s, r ∈ {1, 2, . . . , (p − 1)/2} and r 6= s. The cycles C(s) and C(r) have sets
of edges {0, s}, {s, 2s}, . . . , {(p − 1)s, 0} and {0, r}, {r, 2r}, . . . , {(p − 1)r, 0}
respectively.
We claim that C(s) and C(r) have no common edges. In fact, if we have
{is, (i + 1)s} = {jr, (j + 1)r}, then there are two options: (i) is = jr,
is + s = jr + r which implies that r = s and (ii) is = jr + r, is + s = jr,
which implies s = −r = k − r and this contradicts s ∈ {1, 2, . . . , (p − 1)/2}.
Therefore, the graph G can be decomposed as a union of disjoint cycle graphs
of length p

G = C(s1) ∪ C(s2) ∪ · · · ∪ C(sl)

where {0, si} ∈ G and si ∈ {1, 2, . . . , (p − 1)/2}. As a consequence, G is an
l-regular graph which has lp edges.
We will denote the graph C(s1) ∪ C(s2) ∪ · · · ∪ C(sl) by C(s1, s2 . . . , sl). The
complement graph of a graph of the form C(s1, s2 . . . , sl) also has the form
C(s1, s2 . . . , sl) or is equal to the graph Kp. All the cycle graphs C(s) are
isomorphic, in fact, given s ∈ {1, 2, . . . , (p − 1)/2}, the map Fp → Fp given
by x 7→ sx gives an isomorphism between C(1) and C(s).

Each cycle graph C(si) is ﬁxed under the action of the p-cycle σ =
(01 · · · p − 1) and as a consequence G remains ﬁxed under the action of σ,
that is, σ ∈ Aut(G). We have proved the following.

Lemma 3.2. If G is a graph on p vertices, then p does not divide |[G]| if
and only if G = Kp or G is isomorphic to one of the graphs C(s1, s2 . . . , sl).

Now we go to graphs on 2p vertices.

If G is a graph on 2p vertices (p

an odd prime) and G have exactly k vertices of a ﬁxed degree r, then (cid:0)2p
k(cid:1)
k(cid:1) = (2p)!
divides |[G]| by lemma 2.2. The only way p does not divide (cid:0)2p

k!(2p−k)!
is that p2 divides k!(2p − k)!, which occurs if and only if k = p or k = 2p.

Thus, we assume that p does divide |[G]| and consider the following two cases.

Case 1. k = p. In this case there are exactly p vertices of degree r, say
they are a1, . . . , ap. The other p vertices, say b1, . . . , bp, must have the same
degree s, where s 6= r. Each automorphism of G preserves the a′
is and
also preserves the b′
js. The group Aut(G) is isomorphic to a subgroup of
S{ai} × S{bj }
Let G1 be the subgraph of G which is the subgraph induced by the vertices
a1, . . . , ap, G2 be the subgraph of G induced by the vertices bj’s and let H
be the subgraph of G whose edges are all edges of G having the form {ai, bj}
(see ﬁgure 2).

∼= Sp × Sp.

If p2 divides the size of Aut(G), then Aut(G) contains a subgroup of order
p2. The subgroups of order p2 in Sp × Sp have the form hσi × hτ i where both
σ and τ have order p. Thus, Aut(G) ⊆ S{ai} × S{bj} contains a subgroup of
the form hαi × hβi where both elements α and β have order p (α and β are
p-cycles).
Let t be the number of the b′
js that are adjacent to a1. Then, for each
i = 1, 2, . . . , p, the number of the b′
js adjacent to ai is also t because auto-
morphisms of G preserve the adjacency and α × id acts transitively on the
a′
is while α × id ﬁxes the bj’s. Thus, the number of edges of H is mH = pt.
Similarly, if u is the number of a′
is adjacent to b1, then mH = pu. Hence,
u = t.

If t = 0, then H has no edges.

In this case G = G1 ∪ G2 and since
no component of G1 is isomorphic to a component of G2, we have that
Aut(G) ∼= Aut(G1) × Aut(G2). Therefore, p does not divide |[G]| if and
only if p2 divides |Aut(G)| and this is equivalent to say that p divides both
|Aut(G1)| and |Aut(G2)|. Both graphs G1 and G2 have p vertices and p
divides the size of their automorphism groups, so both graphs G1 and G2

8

ANDRÉS ANGEL, JERSON BORJA

have the form of the graphs described in lemma 3.2. Then, G1 and G2 are
regular graphs of diﬀerent degree.

If t > 0, the permutation id×β permutes transitively the bj’s and ﬁxes a1,
this implies that t = p, H = Kp,p and G = G1 + G2. Therefore, G = G1 ∪ G2
that lies in the case t = 0 above, so that G1 and G2 and also G1 and G2
have the form of of the graphs described in lemma 3.2.

Case 2. k = 2p. In this case G is a regular graph of degree r. When r = 0,
G = K2p. We assume r > 0. By lemma 2.1, the group Aut(G) decomposes
as

Aut(G) ∼= (Aut(G1) ≀ Sn1) × · · · × (Aut(Gs) ≀ Sns),

where the Gi’s are the distinct connected components of G and ni is the
number of components of G isomorphic to Gi. If mi is the number of vertices
of Gi, then 2p = n1m1 + n2m2 + · · · + nsms, Aut(Gi) is isomorphic to a

isolated vertices in G, we have that mi ≥ 2 for all i.

subgroup of Smi and |Aut(G)| divides Qi ni! · (mi!)ni. Since there are no
We want to determine conditions under which p2 divides Qi ni! · (mi!)ni.

If some ni ≥ p, then 2p ≥ nimi ≥ 2ni ≥ 2p which implies s = 1, n1 = p and
m1 = 2. It follows that G is the union of p disjoint copies of the complete
graph on 2 vertices K2, besides |Aut(G)| = p!2p is not divisible by p2.

If ni < p for all i, then the only cases in which p2 divides Qi ni! · (mi!)ni

are the following:
(i) mi = 2p for some i. In this case G is a regular connected graph of degree
r > 0.
(ii) mi = p and mj = p for i 6= j. In this case G is the union of two non-
isomorphic regular connected graphs on p vertices, both of degree r.
(iii) mi = p and ni = 2 for some i. G is the union of two copies of a regular
connected graph on p vertices of degree r.
In the case that G is regular and connected of degree r > 0 (case (i)), con-
sider G which is also regular of degree 2p − r − 1 and |Aut(G)| = |Aut(G)|.
If G is also connected, take the one between G and G that has fewer degree,
so we can assume that G is connected of degree r ≤ 2p−1
. This condition on
r is equivalent to r < p. Then we apply Wormald’s theorem (theorem 2.3)

2

to obtain that |Aut(G)| divides r(2p)Qq≤r−1 qβ and we see from this that

p2 is not a divisor of |Aut(G)| (although p could be a divisor of |Aut(G)|).
On the other hand, if G is not connected and p2 divides |Aut(G)| = |Aut(G)|,
then G lies in case (ii) or case (iii). Thus, G is the union of two regular graphs
on p vertices of the same degree, G = H1 ∪ H2 and G = H 1 + H 2.

We conclude that the only way that p2 divides |Aut(G)|, where G is a
regular graph of degree r is that G is of the form G1 ∪ G2 or G1 + G2, where

THE EVASIVENESS CONJECTURE AND GRAPHS ON 2p VERTICES

9

G1 and G2 have the form of the graphs described in lemma 3.2.

We resume our classiﬁcation in the following lemma:

Lemma 3.3. Let G be a graph on 2p vertices such that p2 divides |Aut(G)|,
or equivalently that p does not divide |[G]|. Then, G is isomorphic to a graph
of the form G1 ∪ G2 or to a graph of the form G1 + G2, where G1 and G2
are graphs on p vertices of the form described in lemma 3.2. The graphs G1
and G2 are allowed to be isomorphic.

Remark 3.4. To determine all graphs G on 2p vertices such that p does
not divide |[G]|, it suﬃces to determine all graphs H on p vertices such that
p does not divide |[H]| (lemma 3.2 contains the precise description of such
graphs H) and then take unions G1 ∪ G2 and joins G1 + G2 of such graphs.
Graphs of the form G1 + G2 are obtained from those of the form G1 ∪ G2 by
the relation G1 ∪ G2 = G1 + G2.

4. Oliver groups and lower bounds for the dimension of

non-evasive monotone graph properties

A ﬁnite group Γ is an Oliver group if Γ has a normal p-subgroup Γ1 such
that the quotient Γ/Γ1 is cyclic. Thus, all ﬁnite p-groups are oliver groups.
The importance of these groups is justiﬁed by the following theorem.

Theorem 4.1. (Oliver) Let K be a simplicial complex, Γ be a ﬁnite sub-
group of Aut(K) and p be a ﬁxed prime. Assume that
i) |K| is Z/p-acyclic and
ii) Γ has a normal p-subgroup Γ1 such that the quotient Γ/Γ1 is cyclic.
Then χ(|K|Γ) = 1. In particular, |K|Γ is nonempty.

Let P be a nonempty monotone and non-evasive graph property. If Γ is
an Oliver group acting on |P|, where P is regarded as simplicial complex,
then |P|Γ 6= ∅.
In the abstract version of |P|Γ we obtain that P Γ 6= ∅
and this means that there are some graphs in P that are also (union of)
orbits of the action of Γ on the set of vertices of P (the 2-elements subsets
of {1, 2, . . . , n}).

We will consider Oliver groups that are subgroups of Sn because they au-
tomatically act on P as automorphisms of P. We conclude that at least one
of the orbits of Γ acting on the 2-element subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n} must be a
graph belonging to P.

For the ﬁrst example, suppose n = pr is a prime power and consider
GF (pr), the ﬁnite ﬁeld of pr elements. For a, b GF (pr), a 6= 0 let φa,b :
GF (pr) → GF (pr) be the aﬃne linear map deﬁned by φa,b(x) = ax + b.
If Γpr = {φa,b : a, b GF (pr), a 6= 0}, then Γpr is an Oliver group.
In
fact, this group Γpr is the one used by Kahn, Saks and Sturtevant in the
proof of theorem 1.2 (see [5]). The normal p-subgroup with cyclic quotient is
Γ1 = {φ1,b : b ∈ GF (pr)}. The group Γpr acts doubly transitively on GF (pr)

10

ANDRÉS ANGEL, JERSON BORJA

(the set of vertices) which implies that there is just one orbit of Γpr acting
on the two-element subsets of {1, 2, . . . , pr}, the complete graph Kpr .

Now suppose that n = pr + t and consider the group Γpr × Z/t where Γpr
acts on the vertices 1, 2, . . . , pr as above while ﬁxes the vertices pr + 1, . . . , n
and the factor Z/t acts on 1, 2, . . . , pr trivially and acts on the remaining t
vertices pr + 1, . . . , n by permuting them cyclically.

We know that Γpr has the normal p-subgroup Γ1 with cyclic quotient.
Then Γ1 is also a normal p-subgroup of Γ × Z/t with quotient isomorphic
to (Γ/Γ1) × Z/t which is cyclic when pr − 1 and t are coprimes. Thus, the
group Γ × Z/t is an Oliver group if pr − 1 and t are coprimes.

The orbits of the action of Γpr × Z/t on the two element subsets of
{1, 2, . . . , n} are the complete graph on the vertices 1, 2, . . . , pr with the
remaining t vertices isolated, that is, Kpr ∪ Kt; the complete bipartite graph
Kpr,t and the orbits of the form K pr ∪ G, where G is one of the graphs on t
vertices pr + 1, . . . , n that are ﬁxed under the action of Z/t.

Proposition 4.2. Any nonempty monotone and non-evasive graph property
on n = pr + t vertices, where (pr − 1, t) = 1, has to contain some of the
following graphs: Kpr ∪ K t, Kpr ,t or one of the graphs of the form K pr ∪ G,
where G is one of the graphs on t vertices pr + 1, . . . , n that are ﬁxed under
the action of Z/t.

Corollary 4.3. Any nonempty monotone and non-evasive property P of
graphs on n = pr + 1 vertices, where n > 3, has to contain one of the two
graphs Kpr ∪ K1 or Kpt,1. In particular dim P ≥ n − 2. Moreover, if P is
nontrivial then P cannot contain both Kpr ∪ K1 and Kpt,1.

Proof. Applying proposition 4.2, P has to contain Kpr ∪ K1 or Kpt,1. These
two graphs have pr(pr − 1)/2 = (n − 1)(n − 2)/2 and pr = n − 1 edges
respectively. In any case dim P ≥ n − 2 if n > 3. The two graphs A =
Kpr ∪ K1 and B = Kpt,1 are the only two orbits of the Oliver group Γ × {∗}
acting on the 2-element subsets of 1, 2, . . . , n. Thus, A and B represent
the only two (potential) vertices of the simplicial complex P Γ×{∗}. If both
A and B belong to P, then A and B are vertices of P Γ×{∗}. By theorem
4.1, χ(|P Γ×{∗}|) = 1, which obligates P Γ×{∗} to contain the simplex {A; B},
which means that Kn = A ∪ B belongs to P and this implies that P is
trivial.

The following to results are generalizations of the corresponding results
for 6 vertices in [5]. In the proof of each result an Oliver group is used in
combination with theorem 4.1. Both results concern monotone non-evasive
properties of graphs on 2p vertices.

Proposition 4.4. Let P be a nontrivial monotone and non-evasive graph
property on 2p vertices, where p is prime. Then all perfect matchings belong
to P.

THE EVASIVENESS CONJECTURE AND GRAPHS ON 2p VERTICES

Proof. Let Γ be the group generated by the permutations (1 p + 1), (2 p +
2), . . . , (p 2p) and α = (1 2 · · · p)(p + 1 p + 2 · · · 2p). The subgroup H of
Γ generated by (1 p + 1), (2 p + 2), . . . , (p 2p) is a normal 2-subgroup with
quotient isomorphic to the subgroup of Γ generated by α, which is cyclic.
Then Γ is an Oliver group and P Γ 6= ∅.

We claim that every orbit of Γ acting on the two-element subsets of
{1, 2, . . . , 2p} contains a perfect matching. One of such orbits is the set
of edges {1, p}, {2, p + 1}, . . . , {p, 2p} (a perfect matching!).
Let G be any other orbit and {r, s} ∈ G. We can assume that r, s ∈
{1, 2, . . . , p}, for if r ≤ p and s > p then s − p 6= r and the permu-
tation (s − p s) sends {r, s} to {r, s − p}, and s − p ∈ {1, 2, . . . , p}.
If
r, s > p, then (r − p r)(s − p s) sends {r, s} to {r − p, s − p} and both
r − p, s − p ∈ {1, 2, . . . , p}. The orbit of {r, s} under α is a cycle graph
of length p with vertices {1, 2, . . . , p} which is a subgraph of G. Since α1−r
sends r to 1, G contains an edge of the form {1, t} with 1 < t ≤ p. Now, (1 p)
sends {1, t} to {p, t} and so {p, t} ∈ G, then by considering the action of α on
{p, t}, we conclude that {p, t}, {p + 1, t + 1}, {p + 2, t + 2}, . . . , {2p, t + p} ∈ G
(if necessary, when t + i > p we subtract p to obtain a value between 1 and
p). This set of edges is a perfect matching and this ends the proof of our
claim.

Since P Γ 6= ∅, at least one of the orbits of Γ belongs to P and since P
is monotone, P contains a perfect matching. Then, P contains all perfect
matchings for P is closed under isomorphism of graphs.
(cid:3)

Proposition 4.5. Let P be a nontrivial monotone and non-evasive graph
property on 2p vertices, where p is and odd prime. Then at least one of 2Cp,
Kp,p belongs to P.

Proof. The set of 2p vertices is going to be the union of two disjoint copies
of the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fp = {0, 1, . . . , p − 1}, the second copy of Fp will be labeled
F′
p = {0′, 1′, . . . , (p − 1)′}. Let Γ be the group generated by the permutations
α = (0 0′)(1 1′) · · · (p − 1 (p − 1)′), β = (01 · · · p − 1), γ = (0′1′ · · · (p − 1)′).
The subgroup of Γ generated by β and γ is a normal p-subgroup of Γ whose
quotient is cyclic isomorphic to hαi. Thus, Γ is an Oliver group and P Γ 6= ∅.
We investigate the orbits of Γ acting on the two-element subsets of Fp ∪ F′
p.
Note that if G is one of such orbits, then for r, s ∈ Fp, {r, s} ∈ G if and only
if {r′, s′} ∈ G (because α sends {r, s} to {r′, s′}).
Let G0 be the orbit {0, 0′}. The orbit of {0, 0′} under β gives us all edges
of the form {x, 0′} with x ∈ Fp. Then, ﬁxing x ∈ Fp, the orbit of {x, 0′}
under γ gives all edges of the form {x, y′} with y′ ∈ F′
p. We conclude that
all edges {x, y′}, x ∈ Fp, y′ ∈ F′
p are in G0. The group Γ preserves the set of
p}, so G0 = {{x, y′} : x ∈ Fp, y′ ∈ F′
edges {{x, y′} : x ∈ Fp, y′ ∈ F′
p} (G0 is
isomorphic to the complete bipartite graph Kp,p).
Let G be any orbit of Γ diﬀerent from G0. Then, G does not contain any
edge of the form {x, y′} with x ∈ Fp, y′ ∈ F′
p. Let {r, s} ∈ G, then r, s ∈ Fp
or r, s ∈ F′
p. We can assume that r, s ∈ Fp, since {r, s} ∈ G if and only if

{r′, s′} ∈ G. In order to determine G, it suﬃces to determine the orbit of β
acting on the two-element subsets of Fp. If K represents the orbit of {r, s}
under β, then G = K ∪ α(K). Now, the permutation βp−r sends {r, s} to
{0, s−r}. Let t = s−r 6= 0. The orbit of {0, t} under β consists of the p edges
{0, t}, {1, t + 1}, {2, t + 2}, . . . , {p − 1, t + p − 1}, this set of edges is precisely
K. We want to describe K in a more convenient way. The permutation
βt is also a generator of hβi and the orbit of {0, t} under βt is describe as
the set of edges {0, t}, {t, 2t}, {2t, 3t}, . . . , {(p − 2)t, (p − 1)t}, {(p − 1)t, 0},
this is K. In the notation of lemma 3.2, K = C(t). Thus, we have that
G = Gt = C(t) ∪ α(C(t)) = C(t) ∪ C(t′) (since α(C(t)) = C(t′)).

There are (p + 1)/2 orbits of Γ, G0 ∼= Kp,p and C(t) ∪ C(t′) ∼= 2Cp for

t = 1, 2, . . . , (p − 1)/2.
Since P Γ 6= ∅, at least one the orbits of Γ belongs to P and this ends the
proof.
(cid:3)

Corollary 4.6. Let P be a nontrivial monotone and non-evasive graph prop-
erty on 2p vertices, where p > 3 is prime. Then, dimP ≥ 4p − 1.

Proof. By proposition 4.5, at least one of 2Cp, Kp,p belongs to P. If Kp,p is
in P, then P considered as a simplicial complex contains a face of dimension
p2 − 1.
If P does not contain Kp,p, then P contains 2Cp. Therefore, P
contains all the graphs C(t) ∪ C(t′) in the proof of lemma 4.5. Since (p −
1)/2 ≥ 2, there are at least two orbits of the form C(t) ∪ C(t′). By theorem
4.1, χ(|P Γ| = 1, so P must contain a graph which is the union of two of the
orbits C(t) ∪ C8t′), this union has 4p edges and is a face of P of dimension
4p − 1. As p2 − 1 ≥ 4p − 1, we ﬁnd that in any case dimP ≥ 4p − 1.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.7. A result of Bjorner establishes that that for a vertex homoge-
neous simplicial complex K on a ﬁnite set of cardinality m with χ(K) = 1,
the dimension of K satisﬁes dimK ≥ M −1, where M is the maximum prime
power dividing m (see [7]). Corollary 4.6 says that for a nontrivial monotone
and non-evasive property P of graphs 0n 2p vertices, dimP ≥ 4p − 1. P
represents a simplicial complex on a vertex set of p(2p − 1) elements, thus
Bjorner’s bound for the dimension gives 2p − 2 in the best case and 4p − 1
is a better lower bound.

5. Evasiveness and graphs on Ten Vertices

Now we want to apply similar ideas as in the previous section to nontrivial
monotone and non-evasive graph properties P on 10 vertices. We will label
the ten vertices for our graphs as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0′, 1′, 2′, 3′, 4′. First, we apply
lemma 3.2 to p = 5 to ﬁnd all graphs G on the 5 vertices 0,1,2,3,4, such that
5 does not divide |[G]|. They are K 5, C5 ∼= C(1) ∼= C(2) and K5 = C(1, 2)
(note that C(2) = C(1)). Correspondingly, for the 5 vertices 0′, 1′, 2′, 3′, 4′,
we have the graphs C(1′) ∼= C(2′) and C(1′, 2′).

Suppose that, for a graph G on 10 vertices, 5 does not divide |[G]| and
apply lemma 3.3. Then, G is isomorphic to K 10, K10, or to one of the 10
graphs Gi, Gi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 shown in ﬁgure 3.

If P does not contain any of the 10 graphs described by lemma 3.3, then
5 divides χ(P) and so P is evasive. The graph K10 represents the empty
simplex so it does not contribute to χ(P). If P in nontrivial, then P does
not contain K10. As a consequence P must contain some of the graphs in
ﬁgure 3. The following table contains the automorphism groups of Gi for
i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, also the sizes |[Gi]| and the contribution modulo 5 to χ(P)

and [Gj ]’s is the following:

If P is non-evasive, then P contains some of the isomorphism classes
[Gi], [Gj]. The set of such isomorphism classes contained in P becomes an
order ideal of the poset above. Therefore, χ(P) is congruent modulo 5 to
the sum of the terms (−1)mG−1|[G]| where [G] belongs to such order ideal.
We need to determine all the order ideals of the the poset above and also
determine which of them can make χ(P) congruent to 1 mod 5. There are
exactly 9 of these order ideals:

I1 = {[G5]},

I2 = {[G1], [G4], [G5]},
I3 = {[G1], [G3], [G5]},

I4 = {[G1], [G2], [G2], [G4], [G5]},
I5 = {[G1], [G2], [G3], [G4], [G5]},
I6 = {[G1], [G3], [G3], [G4], [G5]},

I7 = {[G1], [G2], [G3], [G4], [G2], [G4], [G5]},
I8 = {[G1], [G2], [G3], [G2], [G3], [G4], [G5]},

I9 = {[G1], [G2], [G3], [G4], [G1], [G2], [G3], [G4], [G5]}.

If P just contain the isomorphism classes in Ik, k = 1, . . . , 9, we say that P
is of type k. It can be veriﬁed that P is of type k if and only if P ∗ is of type
10 − k.

Now, we are going to show that types 1, 3, 7 and 9 cannot happen.

First we show that P cannot be of type 3 nor 7. Proposition 4.5 implies
that P contains one of the 2, K5,5 ∼= G5 or 2C5 ∼= G3. The corresponding
Oliver group is Γ = h(00′)(11′)(22′)(33′)(44′), (01234), (0′ 1′2′3′4′)i. The or-
bits of Γ, A ∼= G5, B ∼= G3, C ∼= G3 are shown in ﬁgure 4. By theorem 4.1,
χ(|P|Γ) = 1.

If P is of type 3 or 7, then G3, G5 ∈ P. Thus, we have that A, B, C ∈ P
and since χ(P Γ) = 1, the graphs A ∪ B ∼= A ∪ C are in P, but A ∪ B ∼= G3,
but G3 does not belong to P (see the order ideals I3 and I7 above).

To show that P cannot be of type 1 nor 9, we need the following result of

P. A. Smith [12].

Theorem 5.1. If Γ is a p-group acting on a Z/p-acyclic complex K, then
|K|Γ is also Z/p-acyclic.

Suppose that P is of type 1 and let Γ = h(00′), (12341′2′3′4′)i. Then, Γ is
a 2-group. The (potential) vertices of P Γ are the orbits of Γ acting on the
vertices of the simplicial complex P. These orbits are shown in ﬁgure 5.

Since P is of type 1, P contains G5 but does not contain G1. The graphs in
the following list are in P because each of them is isomorphic to a subgraph
of G5:

A, B, C, D, E, A ∪ B, A ∪ C, A ∪ D, A ∪ E, B ∪ D.

The graphs in the following list are not in P because each of them contains
a subgraph isomorphic to G1:

B ∪ C, B ∪ E, B ∪ F, C ∪ D, C ∪ F, D ∪ E, D ∪ F, E ∪ F.

Observe that the graphs F, A ∪ F and C ∪ E are not in these lists.

Now, A is one of the vertices of the simplicial complex P and A is also
one of the ﬁxed points of Γ. Therefore, Γ acts on lkP (A). Moreover lkP (A)
is a non-evasive complex. The ﬁxed point set of the action of Γ on lkP (A)
is given by lkP (A)Γ = lkP Γ(A).
From the lists of graphs shown above we see that B, C, D, E are vertices of

16

ANDRÉS ANGEL, JERSON BORJA

lkP (A)Γ. Since lkP (A) is Z/2-acyclic, lkP (A)Γ is Z/2-acyclic by theorem
5.1. Then, lkP (A)Γ is connected.

The graph F cannot be a vertex of the simplicial complex lkP (A)Γ because
on the contrary F would be an isolated vertex of lkP (A)Γ. Thus, lkP (A)Γ has
precisely the vertices B, C, D, E, and by the lists of graphs shown above, the
only other faces of lkP (A)Γ can be {B, D} and {C, E}. In any case lkP (A)Γ
results to be non-connected. This contradiction proves that P cannot be of
type 1.

If P is of type 9, then P ∗ is of type 1 and the argument above applies to
P ∗ to conclude that P ∗ cannot be of type 1. Thus, P cannot be of type 9.

Remark 5.2. We have not found the appropriate Oliver groups to use in or-
der to discard the 5 remaining possible types for P. If a nontrivial monotone
and non-evasive graph property on 10 vertices P exists, then it must contain
the isomorphism classes in one of the order ideals Ik for k = 2, 4, 5, 6, 8.
