Abstract—One key aspect of the CELP algorithm is that
it shapes the coding noise using a simple, yet effective,
weighting ﬁlter. In this paper, we improve the noise shaping
of CELP using a more modern psychoacoustic model. This
has the signiﬁcant advantage of improving the quality of an
existing codec without the need to change the bit-stream.
More speciﬁcally, we improve the Speex CELP codec by
using the psychoacoustic model used in the Vorbis audio
codec. The results show a signiﬁcant increase in quality,
especially at high bit-rates, where the improvement is
equivalent to a 20% reduction in bit-rate. The technique
itself is not speciﬁc to Speex and could be applied to other
CELP codecs.

I. INTRODUCTION

When

the Code-Excited Linear Prediction
(CELP) [1] scheme was originally proposed, one
key aspect of the algorithm was how the noise
was shaped using a simple, yet effective, weighting
ﬁlter. Since then, audio coding advances have
provided signiﬁcantly better psychoacoustic models
for shaping coding noise. However, psychoacoustic
modeling in CELP has remained essentially the
same. In this paper, we propose to improve the
quality of an existing CELP codec by using better
noise shaping, without modifying the bit-stream
of the codec. More speciﬁcally, we improve the
Speex1 CELP codec by using a psychoacoustic
model derived from the Vorbis2 audio codec.

Speex is an open-source multi-rate CELP codec
supporting both narrowband and wideband speech.

1http://www.speex.org/
2http://www.vorbis.org/

Unlike most current CELP codecs, it uses a 3-tap
pitch predictor and sub-vector innovation quanti-
zation. Vorbis is a high-quality open-source audio
codec designed for music and uses the modiﬁed
discrete cosine transform (MDCT). Both Speex and
Vorbis are developed within the Xiph.Org Founda-
tion.

This paper is organized as follows. Section II in-
troduces the Speex codec used in this work. Section
III then describes the psychoacoustic model used
by the Vorbis codec. The application of that model
to Speex is described in Section IV. Results are
presented in Section V with a discussion in Section
VI.

II. THE SPEEX CODEC

Speex is an open-source codec based on the
Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) algorithm.
It is targeted mainly towards voice over IP (VoIP)
applications so it is designed to be robust to lost
packets. Speex supports multiple bit-rate, ranging
from 2.15 kbps to 24.6 kbps in narrowband (8
kHz) operation and from 3.95 kbps to 42.2 kbps
in wideband (16 kHz) operation. Some additional
features in Speex are:

• Embedded wideband coding
• Variable bit-rate (source controlled)
• Voice activity detection (VAD) and discontin-

uous transmission (DTX)

• Variable search complexity

The Speex bit-stream was frozen in March 2003
with the release of version 1.0. However, since there

is no “bit-exact” speciﬁcation, it is still possible to
improve the quality of the encoder as long as no
modiﬁcation is required on the decoder side.

A. Perceptual Weighting

In order

to maximize speech quality, CELP
codecs minimize the mean square of the error
(noise) in the perceptually weighted domain. This
means that a perceptual noise weighting ﬁlter W (z)
is applied to the error signal in the encoder. In
most CELP codecs, W (z) is a pole-zero weighting
ﬁlter derived from the linear prediction coefﬁcients
(LPC), generally using bandwidth expansion. Let
the spectral envelope be represented by the synthesis
ﬁlter 1/A(z), CELP codecs typically derive the noise
weighting ﬁlter as:

W (z) =

A(z/g 1)
A(z/g 2)

(1)

where g 1 = 0.9 and g 2 = 0.6 in the Speex reference
implementation.

The weighting ﬁlter is applied to the error sig-
nal used to optimize the codebook search through
analysis-by-synthesis (AbS). This results in a spec-
tral shape of the noise that tends towards 1/W (z).
While the simplicity of the model has been an
important reason for the success of CELP, it remains
that W (z) is a very rough approximation for the
perceptually optimal noise weighting function. Fig.
1 illustrates the noise shaping that results from Eq.
1. Throughout this paper, we refer to W (z) as the
noise weighting ﬁlter and to 1/W (z) as the noise
shaping ﬁlter (or curve).

B. Narrowband Encoder Structure

In narrowband, Speex frames are 20 ms long (160
samples) and are subdivided in 4 sub-frames of 5 ms
each (40 samples). For most narrowband bit-rates (8
kbps and above), the only parameters encoded at the
frame level are the Line Spectral Pairs (LSP) and
a global excitation gain g f rame, as shown in Fig. 2.
All other parameters are encoded at the sub-frame
level.

Linear prediction analysis is performed once per
frame using an asymmetric Hamming window cen-
tered on the fourth sub-frame. The linear prediction
coefﬁcients (LPC) are converted to line spectral
pairs (LSP) and vector-quantized using 30 or 18

bits (depending on the bit-rate used). To make
Speex more robust to packet loss, no prediction is
applied on the LSP coefﬁcients prior to quantiza-
tion. For each sub-frame, the LSP coefﬁcients are
interpolated linearly based on the current and past
quantized LSP coefﬁcients and converted back to
the LPC ﬁlter ˆA(z). The non-quantized interpolated
ﬁlter is denoted A(z).

The analysis-by-synthesis (AbS) encoder loop is
described in Fig. 3. There are three main aspects
where Speex signiﬁcantly differs from most other
CELP codecs. First, while most recent CELP codecs
make use of fractional pitch estimation [2] with a
single gain, Speex uses an integer to encode the
pitch period, but uses a 3-tap predictor [3] (3 gains).
The adaptive codebook contribution ea[n] can thus
be expressed as:

ea[n] = g0e[n − T − 1] + g1e[n − T ] + g2e[n − T + 1]
(2)
where g0, g1 and g2 are the jointly quantized pitch
gains and e[n] is the codec excitation memory.

vector size of 20 samples with 32 entries in the
codebook (5 bits). This means that the innovation
is encoded with 10 bits per sub-frame, or 2000 bps.
On the other hand, the 18.2 kbps mode uses a sub-
vector size of 5 samples with 256 entries in the
codebook (8 bits), so the innovation uses 64 bits
per sub-frame, or 12800 bps.

III. THE VORBIS PSYCHOACOUSTIC MODEL
The masking model we use in this paper is based
on elements of the psychoacoustic model of the
Vorbis open-source audio codec, speciﬁcally noise
masking. Noise masking in the Vorbis codec is
implemented in a conceptually similar manner to the
Spectral Flatness Measure introduced by Johnston
[4]. A geometric median and envelope follower are
constructed by smoothing the log spectrum with
a sliding window of approximately one Bark. The
distance between the two curves provides a tonality
estimate for a given band of the spectrum. The enve-
lope curve is companded according to the distance
in order to directly compute a noise mask curve that
is used for spectral weighting.

frame.

A. Psychoacoustics Basic Ideas

Many current CELP codecs use moving average
(MA) prediction to encode the ﬁxed codebook gain.
This provides slightly better coding at the expense
of introducing a dependency on previously encoded
frames. A second difference is that Speex encodes
the ﬁxed codebook gain as the product of the global
excitation gain g f rame with a sub-frame gain correc-
tions gsub f . This increases robustness to packet loss
by eliminating the inter-frame dependency. The sub-
frame gain correction is encoded before the ﬁxed
codebook is searched (not closed-loop optimized)
and uses between 0 and 3 bits per sub-frame,
depending on the bit-rate.

The third difference is that Speex uses sub-vector
quantization of the innovation (ﬁxed codebook)
signal instead of an algebraic codebook. Each sub-
frame is divided into sub-vectors of lengths ranging
between 5 and 20 samples. Each sub-vector is
chosen from a bitrate-dependent codebook and all
sub-vectors are concatenated to form a sub-frame.
As an example, the 3.95 kbps mode uses a sub-

Audio coding uses psychoacoustics in two ways.
The ﬁrst is a separable mechanism that quantiﬁes
the relative importance of speciﬁc audio features
so that the encoding may be weighted toward rep-
resenting the most important. This analytical op-
timization is entirely encoder-side and although it
operates within the framework of the codec design,
it tends not to be part of a codec speciﬁcation.
The metrics and decision logic may change without
affecting the compatibility of the bit-stream. In
this role, psychoacoustics are essential to efﬁciency
but optional to correct mechanical operation. Most
codecs,
in this
category.

including Vorbis and Speex fall

Secondly, every audio codec also relies on some
amount of psychoacoustic design hardcoded into the
codec speciﬁcation. Such hardwired psychoacous-
tics are part of the required mechanisms of both
the encoder and decoder. A number of contem-
porary codecs dispense with the former optional
psychoacoustics altogether, relying entirely on the
hardwired psychoacoustics of the codec’s explicit
design. In such codecs, like the transform-coded

excitation (TCX) [5] algorithm, it is not possible to
change the psychoacoustic model without changing
the bit-stream.

B. The Vorbis Model

The Vorbis codec relies on encode-side psychoa-
coustic heuristics in order to produce effective bit-
streams, as illustrated in Fig. 4. From each frame’s
audio spectrum, it computes a ﬂoor curve which
is used as a unit-resolution whitening ﬁlter, that is,
the ﬂoor is used to normalize the spectrum such
that a direct linear quantization of the normalized
spectrum is perceptually appropriate. Thus, the ﬂoor
performs a similar function to the conceptually
simpler perceptual weighting ﬁlter used in Speex
and other CELP codecs. However, in the case of
Vorbis, the ﬂoor curve is required for decoding,
whereas CELP merely uses the weighting ﬁlter for
optimizing the search for the best entries in the
codebooks.

The frame-by-frame psychoacoustic metrics used
by the Vorbis encoder to compute the ﬂoor fall into
four main categories: tone masking, noise masking,
noise normalization, and impulse analysis.

1) Tone Masking: Tone masking in the reference
Vorbis encoder is a simple tone-tone masking engine
which produces a single spectral curve per frame.
This curve represents the threshold of perception,
per spectral line, for a pure tone in the current spec-
tral frame. The curve is computed by superposition

of tonal masking curves such as those originally
presented by Ehmer [6]. Note that the reference
encoder uses curves measured independently by
Xiph.Org.

Tone-tone masking analysis and the tonal mask-
ing curve are of only marginal direct importance
in the modern Vorbis codec; most commercially
produced audio programmes have seen deep single-
and multi-band compression such that there is in-
sufﬁcient dynamic depth for tone masking to result
in much savings.

2) Noise Masking: Noise masking in Vorbis is
something of a historical misnomer; although it
began as a simple noise-noise masking mechanism
analogous to the tone-tone masking above, in time
it has become more concerned with constructing
a curve that represents the approximate envelope
of noise energy in the spectrum. This curve is
computed from geometric median and envelope fol-
lowers constructed by smoothing the log spectrum
with a sliding window of approximately one Bark.
The envelope curve is companded according to
the distance between the envelope and the mean;
greater distances imply greater tonality and lower
distances imply greater noisiness. Accordingly, the
amplitude of this mask curve is depressed in areas
of greater tonality. Vorbis then adds a hardwired bias
curve (the noise offset) to the companded envelope,
producing the ﬁnal noise mask curve.

3) Noise Normalization: Noise normalization is
conceptually part of analyzing and handling noise
energy as described under noise masking, but it is
handled in a separate step. The purpose of normal-
ization is to preserve approximate wideband energy
through quantization, especially at very low S/N
ratios, where large portions of the spectrum may
otherwise collapse toward silence. It may be viewed
as a mechanism that preserves the intent of noise
masking through the quantization process. The need
for the speciﬁc implementation of noise normaliza-
tion in the Vorbis encoder is a consequence of the
nature of a frequency domain codec.

4) Impulse Analysis: Impulse analysis refers to
several metrics that characterize highly temporally
localized events in an audio frame, such as a sudden
impulse or attack in the audio. Earlier stages in
the Vorbis encoder analyze attacks and preecho
potential to determine when to switch between short

and long frames, reusing these metrics in the frame-
internal coding algorithm. Frame analysis also in-
spects audio frames for an impulse-train-like nature,
that is, audio resembling a ﬁlter being driven by an
impulse train; such audio tends to have a particularly
regular harmonic structure into the high harmonics.
Voice is the most obvious example of this variety
of audio.

As with noise normalization, this additional im-
pulse analysis is necessitated by the nature of a
transform codec. Sudden impulses and the charac-
teristic tight rasp of impulsive audio are features not
compactly representable in the frequency domain.
Naive quantization causes narrow events to smear in
time and this loss of temporal resolution is percep-
tually obvious. Impulse analysis is used to improve
representation of non-sinusoidal, non-random-noise
content.

5) Floor Construction: The ﬁnal ﬂoor curve in
vorbis is created from the maximum of a direct
superposition of the tone mask and noise mask
curves. The ﬂoor curve is removed from the MDCT
spectrum of a given audio frame, thus whitening the
spectrum and resulting in spectral residual values.
The ﬂoor and residue are then coded via vector
quantization.

IV. APPLICATION TO CELP CODING

Speex does not use multiple blocksizes and for
that reason,
the block-switching and analysis of
the Vorbis codec is irrelevant. In addition, Speex
natively represents time-localized events and impul-
sive audio characteristics very well. The impulse
analysis as implemented in the Vorbis codec is
speciﬁc to transform codecs and as such is also not
relevant to Speex.

Similarly, noise normalization also addresses a
need highly speciﬁc to the frequency transform do-
main encoder. Noise normalization as realized and
used by the Vorbis encoder prevents gross wideband
energy inﬂation or collapse due to naive quantiza-
tion, a situation from which Speex is relatively well
proofed by virtue of being an LPC-based codec.

Tone and noise masking as described in Section
III-B retain relevance in the context of the Speex
codec. Experience with the Vorbis encoder indicates
that noise masking is responsible for the greatest
bulk of useful bit-rate savings. For purposes of

initial experimentation, we thus concentrate on im-
plementing noise masking alone in the Speex codec.
One of the assumptions made in the Vorbis codec
is that the quantization noise is entirely masked.
After all,
it must be for the codec to achieve
transparency or near-transparency. This assumption
leads to using a noise weighting curve that
is
very close to the masking curve, which means a
constant (negative) noise-to-mask ratio. However,
the assumption is not valid for Speex because there
are simply not enough bits available for the noise-to-
mask ratio to be negative (or zero) at all frequencies.
This means that the quantization noise is always
audible to some extent. Using the masking curve
directly for noise weighting in Speex would results
in over-emphasis of the noise in the high-energy
regions of the spectrum (typically low frequencies).
For that reason, it is not desirable to have a constant
(positive) noise-to-mask ratio and the masking curve
used by Vorbis needs to be modiﬁed.

In order to obtain good results with the Speex
codec, we need to compress the dynamic range of
the masking curve. It was determined empirically
that the optimal companding consists of applying
an exponent of 0.6 to the masking curve computed
by Vorbis. This value was found to be suitable (near-
optimal) for all bit-rates.

A. Masking Curve to Weighting Filter

In the integration of the new psychoacoustic
model in Speex, it is desirable to keep the same

pole-zero formulation for the noise shaping ﬁlter:

1

W (z)

=

Wn(z)
Wd(z)

(3)

For that reason, the frequency-domain noise shap-
ing curve is converted to a 10th order pole-zero ﬁlter
using a two-step method. The ﬁlter denominator
Wd(z) is ﬁrst obtained by transforming the masking
curve into auto-correlation coefﬁcients using an
inverse FFT and then applying the Levinson-Durbin
algorithm.

The ﬁlter numerator Wn(z) is then estimated based
on the error between the all-pole model and the
real masking curve. In practice, Wn(z) is nearly ﬂat
because Wd(z) alone is able to provide a very good
approximation of the real curve.

Transforming the masking curve to a pole-zero
model not only makes the implementation easy, but
it preserves the efﬁciency of the CELP analysis-by-
synthesis (AbS) codebook search. In order to limit
the complexity, the masking curve is computed only
once every frame. For each sub-frame, the curve is
linearly interpolated and converted to a pole-zero
ﬁlter.

B. Complexity Reduction

The computation and conversion of the masking
curve described above tends to increases the com-
plexity of the Speex codec. To compensate for that,
we propose three methods to minimize the impact
of the proposed psychoacoustic model:

1) Not using the ﬁlter numerator

Because the weighting ﬁlter numerator Wn(z)
generally has little effect, it can be omitted
without having a signiﬁcant impact on quality.
This decreases the complexity of converting
the masking curve to a pole-zero ﬁlter, while
simplifying the weighting ﬁlter.

2) Setting the denominator to be the same as the

synthesis ﬁlter
By forcing Wd(z) = A(z), it is also possible to
reduce the complexity. While the complexity
reduction in the conversion is smaller than
in method 1, the main advantage lies in the
fact that the most commonly used ﬁlter in the
encoder (Fig. 3) simpliﬁes to W (z)
Wn(z).
This reduces the complexity of the encoder

A(z) = 1

Figure 6. Speex wideband encoder

by approximately one million operations (add
or multiply) per second.

3) Using a frame-constant numerator

By using method 2 and keeping the same
numerator Wn(z) for whole frames, we can
reduce the cost of converting the ﬁlters by a
factor of four. The resulting complexity be-
comes similar to that of the reference encoder,
while still providing a quality improvement.

C. Application to Wideband Coding

To facilitate inter-operability with the public
switched telephone network (PSTN), Speex encodes
wideband speech using the Sub-Band CELP (SB-
CELP) technique. This consists of splitting the
signal in two bands using a quadrature mirror ﬁlter
(QMF), as shown in Fig. 6. The lower band (0-
4 kHz) is encoded using the narrowband encoder,
while the higher band is encoded using a pitch-
less version of CELP (denoted HF-CELP). No pitch
prediction is used for the higher band because the
spectral folding caused by the QMF makes the
signal non-periodic.

Only three parameters/vectors are transmitted: the
high-band LSP parameters, sub-frame gain correc-
tions and the innovation signal. We use 8 LSPs,
jointly quantized with 12 bits. The gain corrections
are computed based on the ratio between high-band
to low-band excitation and correcting for the LPC
response difference at the cutoff frequency (4 kHz).
The innovation can be encoded using 8, 4, or 0 kbps.
In the lowest bit-rate, only the shape of the spectrum
is preserved and the excitation is a frequency-aliased
version of the narrowband part. This is done using
a technique conceptually similar to [7] and requires
only 1.8 kbps to transmit the higher band.

Because of the embedded structure, no additional
work is necessary to make the proposed psychoa-

coustic model work with Speex in wideband oper-
ation. It was found that the psychoacoustic model
in the narrowband encoder is also suitable for the
lower band of wideband speech. For the high-band,
the reference psychoacoustic model is used. Al-
though it would be possible to compute the masking
curve on the wideband signal and then divide the
spectrum in two bands, the added complexity (code
and CPU time) outweighs the potential beneﬁts.

V. EVALUATION AND RESULTS

We compare the reference Speex encoder to the
modiﬁed encoder using the Vorbis psychoacoustic
model. The experiment is conducted using Speex
version 1.1.12, available from http://www.speex.org/
. The Vorbis psychoacoustic model can be en-
abled by conﬁguring with --enable-vorbis-psy
or deﬁning the VORBIS_PSYCHO macro at compile
time.

The Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality
(PESQ) tool, as deﬁned by ITU-T recommendation
G.862.2 [8], [9], is used to compare the encoders at
various bit-rates for both narrowband and wideband
speech. While not a subjective mean opinion score
(MOS) test, we consider the results to be meaningful
because we are only comparing different noise-
weighting ﬁlters for the same codec. The reference
Speex decoder is used for both encoders. The test
set is composed of 354 speech samples from 177
different speakers (87 male and 90 female) in 20 dif-
ferent languages taken from the NTT multi-lingual

speech database. The Speex codec reference imple-
mentation supports variable search complexity. For
the evaluation, the Speex variable complexity option
is set to 3, meaning that 3 simultaneous hypotheses
are updated when searching for the best adaptive
and ﬁxed codebook entry.

Results for narrowband speech are presented in
Fig. 8 with the AMR-NB,
iLBC and GSM-FR
codecs included as reference. Very low Speex bit-
rates (2.15 and 4 kbps) are not included because
it was found that the new model did not improve
quality at those bit-rates. It can be observed that
the proposed noise weighting signiﬁcantly increases
quality, especially at higher bit-rates. Also, it is
worth noting that the improved encoder at 11 kbps
achieves the same level of quality as the reference
AMR-NB codec at 12.2 kbps.

In Fig. 9, the quality of the original and improved
encoders are plotted with scaling of the x-axis
by 5% and 20% for the original encoder. It can
be observed from there that the improvement is
equivalent to a bit-rate reduction of 5% at low bit-
rates and up to 20% at high bit-rates.

Results for wideband speech are presented in Fig.
10 with the AMR-WB codec included as reference.
Again, very low Speex bit-rates (3.95 and 5.8 kbps)
are not
im-
proved. The proposed noise weighting signiﬁcantly
increases quality for wideband, clearly surpassing
the quality of AMR-WB for bit-rates above 12.8

In a last experiment, we evaluate the effect of
complexity reduction methods proposed in Section
IV-B. Only the 15 kbps narrowband mode is evalu-
ated using each of the three complexity reduction
methods proposed. Results in Table I show that
methods C1 and C2 have no signiﬁcant impact on
quality, while C3 only has a small negative impact.
This makes C3 an attractive choice, since it could
lead to quality improvements without increasing the
encoder complexity.

better psychoacoustic model. It has been observed
that the improvement is more signiﬁcant at high bit-
rate. We ﬁnd this result unintuitive because we ex-
pect it to be easier to improve a lower quality modes.
One hypothesis we propose to explain this result is
the fact that at higher bit-rates, there are more bits
available and thus more possibilities to change the
bit allocation based on the noise weighting. Another
hypothesis is that the lower the bit-rate, the further
the optimal noise shaping is from the ideal masking
curve we use.

Unlike the work by [10],

this proposed im-
provement to Speex can be made without affecting
compatibility or requiring any modiﬁcation on the
decoder side. Also, because it only applies to the
encoder side, the technique could also improve the
quality of other existing and future CELP codecs.
We believe this work clearly demonstrates that the
noise weighting currently used in CELP codecs has
become inadequate. We have also shown that im-
proved noise weighting does not necessarily require
increasing the complexity of the encoder. For these
reasons, it would be desirable to further investigate
alternative noise weighting ﬁlters for use in CELP.
We would also like to validate the results in this
paper with a subjective MOS test.
