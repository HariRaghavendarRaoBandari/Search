Because of absence of time derivatives from scalar potential as a generalized coordinate of gravitation
ﬁeld (GF) in action of nonrelativistic gravitating system, application of the Hamilton method for description
of GF mechanics was impossible. In the paper a transformation of the generalized coordinate of GF, that is
based on continuity equation and minimal action principle, is proposed. A potential vector is introduced that
is similar to ﬁxing of Hamilton gauge of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. This transformation gives possibility of the
calculation a Hamilton function (HF), removes mathematical troubles of the Jeans theory (Jeans swindle)
and allows to construct kinetic theory of GF using statistical mechanics methods.

Introduction

Nowadays we have powerful computers that allow us to calculate motion of every particle of complicated

systems, but for macroscopic systems like galaxies or clusters we still need to simplify our description.

It is well known that main equations (kinetic or hydrodynamic) of stellar dynamics theory use self-
consistent GF [1]. That means, all correlation moments of GF are neglected and the ﬁrst moment (mean
ﬁeld) is considered as external ﬁeld.

On the other hand, to construct more accurate theory we need HF of masses with gravitation interaction.
Such function has been written many years ago by Hamilton himself, but without generalized coordinates
(and freedom degrees) of GF! That is eﬀective HF for masses only which uses special solution of Poisson
equation to deliver from GF.

We will try to use analogy with longitudinal electromagnetic ﬁeld [2] to construct a transformation of
generalized coordinates of GF, which gives HF with GF coordinates. That will allow us to use statistical
mechanics methods to describe GF not only by mean ﬁeld, but also, for example, by one particle distribution
functions (normal and anomalous) which are equivalent to second correlation moments of GF, that gives
more information about GF and whole system.

Mechanics

We shall start from action for Newtonian GF and masses m (equal for simplicity) with density σ ([3]§106)

This action looks like action for longitudinal electric ﬁeld in ﬁxed Coulomb gauge (with minus, of course). It
is well known, that (3) gives us only eﬀective HF, because there are no time derivatives from scalar potential
of GF. That means, scalar potential is not a convenient generalized coordinate and we need transform it.

Obviously, we have the continuity equation (from charge conservation fact)

div~j + ∂tρ = 0,

(4)

(density and current of mass are respectively ρ = Pa eaδ (x − xa) and ~j = Pa ea~υδ (x − xa)). This is a

common physical fact, but we can not obtain it with Noether theorem from the action (3). However, we can
make gauge transformation using (4) in standard way. We introduce a new function of time and coordinates
λ and, after integration by parts, obtain

Z Z (cid:16)div~j + ∂tρ(cid:17) λdV dt = −Z Z (cid:16)~j∇λ + ρ∂tλ(cid:17)dV dt

(5)

and subtract (5) form (3) to obtain combination R R ρ (∂tλ − ϕ)dV dt that allows to vanish ϕ in such a way
(6)
Then let introduce a potential ~A = c∇λ, that will be a new (dynamical) coordinate of GF (c is an
arbitrary constant, introduced for analogy with electric ﬁeld). Now, after using (6) in last term (3), we
obtain that the action is

ϕ = ∂tλ.

and we have generalized velocity proper to the new coordinate. We now introduce a notation for GF strength

Dynamical equations for GF moments

A system with macroscopic number of particles (stars) can be described by distribution function which

satisfy Liouville equation ∂tρ(t) =n ˆH, ρ (t)o . Then dynamical (time) equation for arbitrary physical value
can be written as ˙An (x, t) = −Spρ (t)n ˆH, ˆAn (x)o . For potential and strength of GF we have

ˆ~J (x) has such microscopic structure ˆJn (x) ≡ ˆjn (x)−
ˆAn (x) ˆΩ (x) . And we can write in such a manner equations for any moments of GF. Let us consider

Gravitation interaction is weak and then we can use Bogolyubov boundary condition of complete corre-
lation weakening [5] to ﬁnd solution of Liouville equation in perturbation theory. We can divide HF (9) into
main part and weak interaction. GF main part of HF is

Let suppose for simplicity that subsystem of free particles is thermostat. Then we obtain with the help

Kinetic coeﬃcients in the GF equations

Averaging with distribution function (13) sources in (10) and (11), we obtain current up to the second

order, which is linear on GF parameters

Dispersion equation for (19) is ωk = 4π(cid:16)σk − λk
k = Ω2 + 4πGl (k, iωk) . It gives
well known results for example with Maxwell distribution function of particles. For big wave vector and one
√π/2
type of particles we have ωk = −
we have increment ωk = ±qΩ2 − 3k2υ2
T .
When we have external current with increment ω, we must change in (12) ω2(x − x′) → ω2 and go on
nk (cid:1) . If we return to standard scalar potential

to obtain ωAl
E = −∇ϕ then for point mass and zero frequency we obtain gravitation screening ϕ(~r) = −
.
It is well known that Jeans theory in equilibrium state requires ϕ = 0 ([6] p.273), but Poisson equation
forbids it (Jeans swindle). Using (10) in hydrodynamical medium we have equation ˙En = 4πρun that has
zero equilibrium solution.

But in equilibrium state GF is not absent. It has nonzero values of second correlation moments. For
example, energy of GF is proportional to (EnEm(x′ − x)) correlation moment and from (11) we obtain
(EE)k = −4πT, where T is thermostat temperature.
Solution for linear equations (11) with (17) has the form of combination frequencies A(t) = Ae(ωk+ωk′ )t.
For homogeneous and isotropic but nonstationary GF, when the ﬁrst moments are zero, for the second
moments we obtain time dependence with 2ωk.

Results and Conclusions

So, we have transformed nonrelativistic action for masses and GF using continuity equation and introduced
potential vector as a new generalized coordinate of GF. That allows us to obtain real (not eﬀective!) HF
for this system with generalized coordinate and momentum of GF. Using Bogolyubov reduced description
method with special GF main HF we have obtained time equations for the ﬁrst and the second correlation
moments of GF, that are linear in perturbation theory of weak gravitation interaction. Equations for mean
GF give zero equilibrium solution, unlike the Poisson equation, that removes mathematical troubles of the
Jeans theory (Jeans swindle). Expressions for kinetic coeﬃcients in terms of the Green function of the
currents are constructed. Solutions for GF equations in the case of Maxwell particles distribution are found.
