(Dated: March 4, 2016)

The φ-Λ(1520) interference eﬀect in the γp → K +K −p reaction has been measured for the ﬁrst
time in the energy range from 1.673 to 2.173 GeV. The relative phases between φ and Λ(1520)
production amplitudes were obtained in the kinematic region where the two resonances overlap.
The measurement results support strong constructive interference when K +K − pairs are observed
at forward angles, but destructive interference for proton emission at forward angles. Furthermore,
the observed interference eﬀect does not account for the √s = 2.1 GeV bump structure in forward
diﬀerential cross sections for φ photoproduction. This fact suggests possible exotic structures such
as a hidden-strangeness pentaquark state, a new Pomeron exchange and rescattering processes via
other hyperon states.

PACS numbers: 13.60.Rj, 13.88.+e, 24.70.+s, 25.20.Lj

The φ-meson production has the unique feature of
gluon dynamics as a result of OZI suppression due to the

dominant s¯s structure of the φ meson, which is predicted
to proceed via the Pomeron trajectory with J P C = 0++

[1–7]. Cross sections for diﬀractive φ photoproduction
are then predicted to increase smoothly with photon en-
ergy. However, a bump structure at √s = 2.1 GeV in
forward diﬀerential cross sections was ﬁrst reported by
the LEPS collaboration [8]. Despite extensive experimen-
tal eﬀorts devoted for the photoproduction of φ mesons
near the threshold, the nature of the bump structure has
not yet been explained in detail [9, 10]. Kiswandhi et
al. [11] suggested that the bump structure is the result
of an excitation of missing nucleon resonances. However,
the bump structure observed from CLAS appears only
at forward angles; thus, a conventional resonance inter-
pretation seems less likely [10]. Very recently, the LHCb
collaboration [12] claimed to have observed two J/ψ p
resonances referred to as hidden-charm pentaquark states
(ccuud) from Λ0
b decays. In φ photoproduction, a hidden-
strangeness pentaquark state could also be searched for
as a candidate for the forward bump structure. Re-
cent theoretical studies further relate this to a coupling
between the φp and K +Λ(1520) channels, because the
bump structure occurs very close to the threshold of
Λ(1520) production [13, 14]. The φ-Λ(1520) interfer-
ence could also account for the bump structure, but it
has not yet been measured in K +K −p photoproduction.
The interference may be either positive (constructive) or
negative (destructive), depending on the relative phase
between the production amplitudes of φ and Λ(1520).

Here, we report the measurement of the forward diﬀer-
ential cross sections for φ and Λ(1520) photoproduction
and the relative phase angles between their photopro-
duction amplitudes. The importance of this analysis in-
cludes the event selection for γp → K +K −p, which was
based on a kinematic ﬁt. Furthermore, the yields of φ
and Λ(1520) were obtained from a simultaneous ﬁt of
the mK +K− and mK−p invariant masses with lineshapes
from a Monte-Carlo simulation. This self-consistent anal-
ysis enables the investigation of a potential interference
eﬀect between φ and Λ(1520). To our knowledge, no in-
terference measurement for this reaction has previously
been reported in the literature.

The experiment was carried out using the LEPS detec-
tor at the SPring-8 facility in Japan. Linearly polarized
photons with the energy from 1.5 to 2.4 GeV was pro-
duced using a laser backscattering technique [15] with
UV lasers. The photon beam was incident on a 15-cm
liquid-hydrogen target, in which K +, K − and p parti-
cles were produced and then passed through the LEPS
spectrometer with the standard conﬁguration [16].

With a full data set of LH2 runs, a new analysis on φ-
Λ(1520) photoproduction was performed using kinematic
ﬁts and simultaneous ﬁts on the K +K − and K −p mass
spectra with Monte-Carlo lineshapes. To identify candi-
date events, at least two of the K +, K −, and p tracks
were required to be reconstructed using standard particle
identiﬁcation methods.

K −K + events (a) before and (b) after a kinematic ﬁt; (c),
(d) and (e), (f) are same as (a), (b) but with forward K −p
events and K +p events, respectively. Projections onto each

vectors of the detected K −, K + and p, are shown in
Fig. 1. The solid lines represent the φ and Λ(1520)
mass bands, each corresponding to a 4 Γφ window for φ
production and a 2 ΓΛ∗ window for Λ(1520) production,
respectively, where Γφ = 4.266 MeV and ΓΛ∗ = 15.6
MeV [17]. Forward particle pairs correspond to the pairs
mostly in the range of cos θ∗ > 0.5 in the production c.m.
system.

The kinematic ﬁt reconstructs three unmeasured pa-
rameters for a missing particle in the K −K +p ﬁnal state.
The energy and momentum conservation laws provide
four constraints. Consequently, we have an overdeter-
mined system with four constraints and three unknowns.
When the χ2-probability of the kinematic ﬁt is required
to be greater than 2%, clear φ and Λ(1520) bands are seen
in the M (K +K −) versus the M (K −p) (see Fig. 1(b),
1(d) and 1(f)). For forward K +p events (Fig. 1(e)),

the background primarily represents a K ∗0Σ+ produc-
tion channel with a small amount of K +Λ(1520) chan-
nel, followed by the Λ(1520) → Σ+π− decay. However,
very little K ∗ background remains after a kinematic ﬁt
is applied (as shown by the histogram in Fig. 1(f)).

ward K +K − events in the energy region from 1.973 to 2.073
GeV, respectively. The best-ﬁt lineshapes for φ are overlaid
with dotted lines, while those for Λ(1520) are represented as
dot-dashed lines. Dashed lines represent the contributions of
non-resonant K +K −p production.

The measured K +K − and K −p mass spectra for the
selected K +K −p events were ﬁtted with the lineshapes
of the simulated processes, φp [18], Λ(1520)K + [19], and
non-resonant K +K −p. For events in which K +p is de-
tected, these mass spectra are ﬁtted with the three pro-
cesses as well as K ∗0Σ+ [20] and K +(Λ(1520) → Σ+π−).
The best-ﬁt lineshapes for φ, Λ(1520) and non-resonant
K +K −p reproduce well both the K +K − and the K −p
mass spectra, as shown in Fig. 2. The χ2 probability
P (χ2; ndf ) is quoted in each of the ﬁtted K +K − and
K −p mass spectra, where ndf represents the number of
degrees of freedom. The ﬁts with Monte-Carlo lineshapes
were based on the events beyond the φ-Λ(1520) interfer-
ence region in which the two resonances appear. The
ﬁt results were then interpolated into the interference re-
gion, keeping the strengths of the Monte-Carlo lineshapes
determined from the ﬁt [21]. This simultaneous ﬁt with
Monte-Carlo lineshapes is a self-consistent method to re-

produce the measured K +K − and K −p mass spectra,
which pertains to the further study of interference eﬀects.

FIG. 3: Forward diﬀerential cross sections for (left) φ and
(right) Λ(1520) photoproduction. Open squares represent
cross-section results obtained without considering interfer-
ence, while closed circles represent new measurement results.

Forward diﬀerential cross sections for φ and Λ(1520)
production channels were measured using the best-ﬁt re-
sults with Monte-Carlo lineshapes in the φ and Λ(1520)
mass bands except for the interference region. The
forward diﬀerential cross sections (dσ/dt at t = tmin)
for φ photoproduction are compared with previous re-
sults from LEPS [8] near the threshold, as shown in
Figure 3(left). Thus, we reconﬁrmed the existence
of the bump structure around Eγ = 2.0 GeV. The
structure appears persistently even with diﬀerent φ-
mass bands, diﬀerent slope parameters, and the exclu-
sion of the interference region in which φ and Λ(1520)
mass bands overlap.
The slope parameters of the
|t − tmin| distributions decreased as the photon energy
increased. The forward cross sections were obtained
from the ﬁt with linearly energy-dependent slope pa-
rameters (dσ/dt =dσ/dt|t=tmin exp(−b|t − tmin|), where
b = −(11.47 − 3.47 E) GeV−2) and E is a dimensionless
quantity taken from the value of the photon energy in
GeV.

Figure 3(right) shows diﬀerential cross sections for
Λ(1520) photoproduction in the angular regions of 0.9 <
cos θ∗
K + < 1.0, which are compared with the previous
LEPS results by Kohri et al.
[22]. While the previous
analysis was based on events with a single K + track,
this measurement required at least two tracks among K −,
K +, and p. As a result, event statistics in this measure-
ment at forward K + angles is smaller than that from pre-
vious measurements. Though the statistics was low, both
results are in good agreement with each other, indicating
the bump structure near Eγ = 2 GeV. Interestingly, the
two cross-section results show the bump structure at the
same Eγ, which could indicate a strong correlation be-
tween φ and Λ(1520). However, the diﬀerence between
the cross sections obtained with and without the interfer-
ence region is not large enough to account for the bump
structure.

dmK +K−dmK−p ∝ |Mφ + MΛ(1520) + Mnr|2,

(1)

where Mφ and MΛ(1520) are the complex amplitudes
for φ and Λ(1520) production processes, respectively.
Mnr represents non-resonant K +K −p production. Each
complex amplitude includes individual amplitudes for all
possible sub-processes, such as Pomeron-exchange and
pseudoscalar meson-exchange processes for φ photopro-
duction. However, log-likelihood ﬁts of the data in φ
and Λ(1520) bands excluding the φ and Λ(1520) inter-

ference region (|Mφ + Mnr|2) with Monte-Carlo line-
shapes (|Mφ|2 + |Mnr|2) result in the χ2 probability
P (χ2) > 0.2 in most cases. Moreover, the S-P wave
interference in φ photoproduction is also known to be as
small as the 1% level [23]. Therefore, we assume that
|Mφ +MΛ(1520) + Mnr|2 ≈ |Mφ + MΛ(1520)|2 +|Mnr|2,
where the interference terms between Mnr and two res-
onance amplitudes are neglected. The contribution from
the term |Mnr|2 was then subtracted from the data.

utilizing Monte-Carlo lineshapes in the φ and Λ(1520)

quently, only a single parameter, the relative phase ψ,
exists in the ﬁt. The best-ﬁt results for relative phase
are shown as solid curves in Fig. 4. To verify the relia-

yields (when K +K − pairs are detected at forward angles) in
the interference region (circles) compared to the predicted lev-
els for the maximum and minimum bounds (solid lines). The
dashed line indicates the predicted levels for no φ-Λ(1520)
interference.

The ﬁt results for relative phase are represented in Fig.
5(left). The χ2 probability was required to exceed 0.1%.
For forward K −p and K +p events, the energy regions
between 1.673 GeV and 2.073 GeV are explored. The
maximum constructive interference has ψ = π/2, while
the maximum destructive interference is represented by
ψ = −π/2. For K +K − events detected in the forward
directions, the resulting relative phases are in most cases
constructive, while those for forward K ±p events are de-
structive.

For forward K +K − events in the energy region of
1.973 < Eγ < 2.073 GeV, the integrated event yield
in the interference region approaches close to the max-
imum bound for the φ-Λ interference, as shown in Fig.
5(right), which is consistent with the relative phase ψ =
1.69 ± 0.12 rad. Moreover, the relative phase ﬂips its sign
as a function of photon energy Eγ. For K −p events, the
relative phase in the energy region of 1.973 < Eγ < 2.073
GeV ﬁrmly stays at a positive value, while in other en-
ergy regions it supports destructive interference. Thus,
it could be inferred that a change in interference pat-
terns would occur when K −p moves to a forward angle.
For the K +p events, only in the lowest-energy region the
phase appears in the positive side, but it remains close
to π, which corresponds to zero interference.

Diﬀerent phases for the event mode (forward K +K −,
K −p and K +p events) may arise from diﬀering kinematic
coverages for the photoproduction of φ and Λ(1520). We
could relate the phases near π/2 for forward K +K −
events to the interference between Pomeron exchange
amplitude for φ and K-exchange amplitude for Λ(1520)
photoproduction. For forward proton events (K −p and
K +p), unnatural-parity exchange processes become im-
portant in φ photoproduction. However, it is worth not-

5

ing that φ-Λ(1520) interference eﬀect does not account
for a 2.1-GeV bump structure in forward diﬀerential cross
sections for φ photoproduction. This result is consistent
with a recent report from CLAS regarding the Λ(1520)
eﬀect [10]. The energy dependence of the phase could
indicate nontrivial rescattering contributions from other
hyperon resonances. The bump structure could then po-
tentially be due to either rescattering processes due to
kinematic overlap in phase space or exotic structures in-
volving a hidden-strangeness pentaquark state and the
exchange of a new Pomeron. Alternatively, they could
be due to a combination of both factors.

In summary,

the photoproduction of the γp →
K +K −p reaction was measured using the LEPS detector
at energies from 1.57 to 2.40 GeV. The φ-Λ(1520) inter-
ference measurement could be a good probe to study the
origin of enhanced production cross sections for φ and
Λ(1520) near √s = 2.1 GeV. In this Letter, we presented
relative phases between φ and Λ(1520) production am-
plitudes by using a two-dimensional mass ﬁt with Monte-
Carlo lineshapes. We reconﬁrmed the bump structure in
the analysis without the φ-Λ(1520) interference region.
On the other hand, we observed clear φ-Λ(1520) inter-
ference eﬀects in the energy range from 1.673 to 2.173
GeV. The data obtained in the present study provide the
ﬁrst-ever experimental evidence for the φ-Λ(1520) inter-
ference eﬀect in φ photoproduction. The relative phase
results suggest strong constructive interference in most
cases for K +K − pairs observed at forward angles, while
destructive interference results from the emission of pro-
tons at forward angles. The nature of the bump structure
could originate from interesting exotic structures such as
a hidden-strangeness pentaquark state, a new Pomeron
exchange and rescattering processes via other hyperon
states.
