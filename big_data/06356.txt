MINIMAL RELATIONS AND CATENARY DEGREES IN KRULL MONOIDS

YUSHUANG FAN AND ALFRED GEROLDINGER

Abstract. Let H be a Krull monoid with class group G. Then H is factorial if and only if G is trivial.
Sets of lengths and sets of catenary degrees are well studied invariants describing the arithmetic of H
in the non-factorial case. In this note we focus on the set Ca(H) of catenary degrees of H and on the
set R(H) of distances in minimal relations. We show that every ﬁnite nonempty subset of N≥2 can be
realized as the set of catenary degrees of a Krull monoid with ﬁnite class group. This answers Problem
4.1 of [12]. Suppose in addition that every class of G contains a prime divisor. Then Ca(H) ⊂ R(H)
and R(H) contains a long interval. Under a reasonable condition on the Davenport constant of G, R(H)
coincides with this interval and the maximum equals the catenary degree of H.

1. Introduction

In this note we study the arithmetic of atomic monoids with a focus on Krull monoids. This setting
includes Krull domains and hence all integrally closed noetherian domains. By an atomic monoid, we
mean a commutative cancelative semigroup with unit element with the property that every non-unit can
be written as a ﬁnite product of atoms (irreducible elements). Let H be an atomic monoid. Then H is
factorial if and only if every equation u1 ·. . .·uk = v1 ·. . .·vℓ, with k, ℓ ∈ N and atoms u1, . . . , uk, v1, . . . , vℓ,
implies that k = ℓ and that, after renumbering if necessary, ui and vi just diﬀer by a unit for all i ∈ [1, k].
It is well-known that H is factorial if and only if it is a Krull monoid with trivial class group.

Suppose that H is atomic but not factorial. Then there is an element a ∈ H having two distinct

factorizations z and z′, which can be written in the form

z = u1 · . . . · ukv1 · . . . · vℓ

and z′ = u1 · . . . · ukw1 · . . . · wm

where k ∈ N0, ℓ, m ∈ N, all ur, vs, wt are atoms, and no vs is associated to any wt with r ∈ [1, k], s ∈ [1, ℓ],
and t ∈ [1, m]. Then we call d(z, z′) = max{ℓ, m} the distance between the factorizations z and z′. The
catenary degree c(a) of a is the smallest N ∈ N0 ∪ {∞} such that for any two factorizations y, y′ of a
there are factorizations y = y0, y1, . . . , yn = y′ of a such that the distance d(yi−1, yi), where i ∈ [1, n], of
each two subsequent factorizations is bounded by N . The catenary degree c(H) of H is deﬁned as the
supremum of the catenary degrees c(a) over all elements a ∈ H.

In this note we study the set of catenary degrees and the set R(H) of distances in minimal relations

of H. More precisely, R(H) is deﬁned as the set of all d ∈ N having the following property:

There is an element a ∈ H having two distinct factorizations z and z′ with distance d(z, z′) = d
but there are no factorizations z = z0, z1, . . . , zn = z′ of a such that d(zi−1, zi) < d for all i ∈ [1, n].

The key idea of the present note is to study R(H) with the help of a crucial subset k∗(H), deﬁned as
k∗(H) = {min(L(uv) \ {2}) | u, v are atoms and the set of lengths L(uv) has at least two elements} .

Thus we consider four closely related sets of invariants, namely R(H), Ca(H), k∗(H), together with the
well-studied set of distances ∆(H) (also called the delta set of H). These sets satisfy some straightforward
inclusions (see Equation (2.2) and Lemma 2.1) but they are diﬀerent in general (Examples 2.3). First

we show that every ﬁnite nonempty subset C ⊂ N≥2 can be realized as the set of catenary degrees of a
Krull monoid with ﬁnite class group (Proposition 3.2). This answers Problem 4.1 of [12].

In contrast to this realization result all these four sets turn out to be highly structured for Krull
monoids with the property that every class contains a prime divisor (this assumption holds true, among
others, for holomorphy rings in global ﬁelds and for all semigroup rings which are Krull). Indeed, under
this assumption on the prime divisors the set k∗(H) is an interval (Proposition 3.3). Under a reasonable
condition on the Davenport constant of the class group, the sets k∗(H)∪{2} and R(H) coincide, they are
intervals, and their maxima equal the catenary degree. In order to formulate our main result, we recall
that for an abelian group G, D(G) denotes the Davenport constant of G (the assumption D(G) = D∗(G)
will be analyzed in Remark 3.5).

Theorem 1.1. Let H be a Krull monoid with class group G such that every class contains a prime
divisor. Then k∗(H) is an interval with k∗(H) ⊂ R(H). Moreover, if D(G) = D∗(G) ∈ N≥4, then

(1.1)

In detail, we have

R(H) = k∗(H) ∪ {2} = [2, c(H)] .

|G| = 1, then R(H) = ∅, and if |G| = 2, then R(H) = {2}. If G is inﬁnite, then R(H) = N≥2.
1. If
2. If D(G) = 3 and every nonzero class contains precisely one prime divisor, then R(H) = k∗(H) =

{3}.

3. If either (cid:0)D(G) = 3 and there is a nonzero class containing at least two distinct prime divisors(cid:1)

or if D(G) ∈ N≥4, then min R(H) = 2 and min k∗(H) = 3.

2. Background on factorizations and Krull monoids

We denote by N the set of positive integers and we put N0 = N ∪ {0}. For integers a, b ∈ Z, we denote
by [a, b] = {c ∈ Z | a ≤ c ≤ b} the discrete interval. For subsets A, B ⊂ Z, A + B = {a + b | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}
denotes the sumset, −A = {−a | a ∈ A}, and y + A = {y} + A for every y ∈ Z. If A = {a1, . . . , ak} with
k ∈ N0 and a1 < . . . < ak, then ∆(A) = {aν+1 − aν | ν ∈ [1, k − 1]} is the set of distances of A. Thus
|A| ≤ 1 if and only if ∆(A) = ∅. For A ⊂ N, we denote by ρ(A) = sup A/ min A ∈ Q≥1∪{∞} the elasticity
of A, and we set ρ({0}) = 1. Let G be an additive abelian group and r ∈ N. An r-tuple (e1, . . . , er) of
elements from G is said to be independent if all elements are nonzero and he1, . . . , eri = he1i ⊕ . . . ⊕ heri.
By a monoid, we mean a commutative cancelative semigroup with unit element, and we will use
multiplicative notation. Let H be monoid. We denote by H × the group of units, by Hred = H/H × the
associated reduced monoid, by A(H) the set of atoms of H, and by q(H) the quotient group of H. For
a set P , we denote by F (P ) the free abelian monoid with basis P . An element a ∈ F (P ) will be written
in the form

pvp(a) with vp(a) ∈ N0 and vp(a) = 0 for almost all p ∈ P ,

a = Y

p∈P

and we call

|a|F = |a| = X

p∈P

vp(a) ∈ N0

the length of a .

Factorizations and sets of lengths. The monoid Z(H) = F (A(Hred)) is the factorization monoid
of H, and the factorization homomorphism π : Z(H) → Hred maps a factorization onto the element it
factors. For an element a ∈ H, we call

• ZH(a) = Z(a) = π−1(aH ×) ⊂ Z(H) the set of factorizations of a, and
• LH (a) = L(a) = {|z| | z ∈ Z(a)} ⊂ N0 the set of lengths of a.

Note that L(a) = {0} if and only if a ∈ H ×, and that 1 ∈ L(a) if and only if a ∈ A(H), and then
L(a) = {1}. The monoid is said to be

MINIMAL RELATIONS AND CATENARY DEGREES IN KRULL MONOIDS

• atomic if Z(a) 6= ∅ for all a ∈ H (equivalently, every nonunit is a ﬁnite product of atoms),
• factorial if
• half-factorial if
• a BF-monoid if L(a) is ﬁnite and nonempty for all a ∈ H.

|Z(a)| = 1 for all a ∈ H (equivalently, Hred is free abelian),

|L(a)| = 1 for all a ∈ H,

From now on we suppose that H is a BF-monoid (which holds true if H is v-noetherian). We denote by
L(H) = {L(a) | a ∈ H} the system of sets of lengths of H, by

∆(H) = [

L∈L(H)

∆(L) ⊂ N

the set of distances of H (also called the delta set of H), and if H is not half-factorial, then it follows
from [16, Proposition 1.4.4] that

(2.1)

min ∆(H) = gcd ∆(H) .

We will study sets of distances and sets of catenary degrees via the following set k∗(H), which is deﬁned
as

k∗(H) = {min(L(uv) \ {2}) | u, v ∈ A(H), |L(uv)| > 1}

= {min(L \ {2}) | 2 ∈ L ∈ L(H), |L| > 1} ⊂ N≥3 .

By deﬁnition, we have

(2.2)

k∗(H) ⊂ 2 + ∆(H) ⊂ N≥3,

H is half-factorial if and only if ∆(H) = ∅, and if this holds then k∗(H) = ∅.
Catenary degrees and minimal relations. Any two factorizations z, z′ ∈ Z(H) can be written in the
form

z = u1 · . . . · ukv1 · . . . · vℓ

and z′ = u1 · . . . · ukw1 · . . . · wm ,

where k, ℓ, m ∈ N0, u1, . . . , uk, v1, . . . , vℓ, w1, . . . , wm ∈ A(Hred), and {v1, . . . , vℓ} ∩ {w1, . . . , wm} = ∅,
and then d(z, z′) = max{ℓ, m} is the distance between z and z′. Thus z = z′ if and only if d(z, z′) = 0. If
z, z′ ∈ Z(a) for some a ∈ H and N ∈ N0, then a ﬁnite sequence z0, z1, . . . , zk in Z(a) is called an N -chain
of factorizations from z to z′ if z = z0, z′ = zk, and d(zi−1, zi) ≤ N for each i ∈ [1, k]. The catenary
degree c(a) ∈ N0 ∪ {∞} of a is deﬁned as the smallest N ∈ N0 ∪ {∞} such that any two factorizations of
a can be concatenated by an N -chain, and

c(H) = sup{c(a) | a ∈ H} ∈ N0 ∪ {∞}

denotes the catenary degree of H. Clearly, c(a) = 0 if and only if |Z(a)| = 1, and hence c(H) = 0 if and

only if H is factorial. If z, z′ ∈ Z(a) are distinct, then 2 + (cid:12)(cid:12)|z| − |z′|(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ d(z, z′), and |Z(a)| > 1 implies

that 2 + sup ∆(L(a)) ≤ c(a) ([16, Lemma 1.6.2]). Since H is a BF-monoid and c(a) ≤ sup L(a) < ∞, the
catenary degrees of all elements are ﬁnite, and we denote by

Ca(H) = {c(a) | a ∈ H with |Z(a)| > 1} ⊂ N≥2

the set of catenary degrees of all elements having at least two distinct factorizations. If a ∈ A(H), then
|Z(a)| = 1, and if |Z(a)| = 1, then c(a) = 0. In order to simplify the statements of our results, we deﬁne
Ca(H) as the set of positive catenary degrees. Furthermore, let R(H) be the set of all d ∈ N≥2 with the
following property:

There are an element a ∈ H and two distinct factorizations z, z′ ∈ Z(a) with d(z, z′) = d such that
there is no (d − 1)-chain of factorizations concatenating z and z′.

Our ﬁrst lemma gathers some elementary properties of all these concepts.

Lemma 2.1. Let H be a BF-monoid.

1. H is factorial if and only if c(H) = 0 if and only if Ca(H) = ∅ if and only if R(H) = ∅.
2. Ca(H) ⊂ R(H). If H is not factorial, then 2 ≤ min Ca(H) and c(H) = sup Ca(H) = sup R(H).

3. k∗(H) ⊂ R(H) ⊂ N≥2.

Proof. 1. Since H is factorial if and only if |Z(a)| = 1 for all a ∈ H, the assertion follows.

2. Let a ∈ H having at least two distinct factorizations. By deﬁnition of c(a), there are factorizations
z, z′ ∈ Z(a) with d(z, z′) = c(a) which cannot be concatenated by a (c(a) − 1)-chain of factorizations.
Thus c(a) ∈ R(H). Suppose that H is not factorial. Then there is an element a ∈ H with |Z(a)| > 1,
and for every such element we have c(a) ≥ 2 whence min Ca(H) ≥ 2. Since c(H) = sup{c(a) | a ∈
H with |Z(a)| > 1}, it follows that c(H) = sup R(H). 3. Suppose that k∗(H) 6= ∅, and let a ∈ H
with 2 ∈ L(a) and |L(a)| > 1. Then there are u1, u2, v1, . . . , vℓ ∈ A(H) with u1u2 = v1 · . . . · vℓ where
ℓ = min(L(a) \ {2}). Since for any distinct two factorizations x, x′ ∈ Z(a) we have d(x, x′) ≥ 2 + ||x| − |x′||
and ℓ = min(L(a) \ {2}), the factorizations z = u1u2 and z′ = v1 · . . . · vℓ cannot be concatenated by an
(ℓ − 1)-chain of factorizations. Thus ℓ = d(z, z′) ∈ R(H).
(cid:3)

Krull monoids and zero-sum sequences. A monoid homomorphism ϕ : H → D is called

• a divisor homomorphism if ϕ(a) | ϕ(b) implies that a | b for all a, b ∈ H,
• a divisor theory (for H) if ϕ is a divisor homomorphism, D is free abelian, and for every α ∈ D

there are a1, . . . , am ∈ H such that α = gcd(ϕ(a1), . . . , ϕ(am)).

A monoid H is a Krull monoid if it satisﬁes one of the following equivalent conditions ([16, Theorem
2.4.8]) :

(a) H is completely integrally closed and satisﬁes the ACC on divisorial ideals.
(b) H has a divisor theory.
(c) There is a divisor homomorphism from H to a factorial monoid.

Suppose that H is a Krull monoid. Then there is a free abelian monoid F = F (P ) such that the
embedding Hred ֒→ F is a divisor theory. The group C(H) = q(F )/q(Hred) is the (divisor) class group of
H and GP = {[p] = pq(Hred) | p ∈ P } ⊂ C(H) is the set of classes containing prime divisors. We refer to
[19] and [16] for detailed presentations of the theory of Krull monoids. Here we just recall that a domain
R is a Krull domain if and only if its monoid of nonzero elements is a Krull monoid, and Property (a)
shows that every integrally closed noetherian domain is Krull. Holomorphy rings in global ﬁelds and
regular congruence monoids in these domains are Krull monoids with ﬁnite class group and every class
contains a prime divisor ([16]). Furthermore, semigroup rings which are Krull have the property that
every class contains a prime divisor ([7]).

We continue with a Krull monoid having a combinatorial ﬂavor whose signiﬁcance will become obvious
in Lemma 2.2. Let G be an additive abelian group and G0 ⊂ G a subset. In additive combinatorics
([18]), a sequence (over G0) means a ﬁnite sequence of terms from G0 where repetition is allowed and the
order of the elements is disregarded, and (as usual) we consider sequences as elements of the free abelian
monoid with basis G0. Let

S = g1 · . . . · gℓ = Y

g∈G0

g vg(S) ∈ F (G0)

be a sequence over G0. Then supp(S) = {g1, . . . , gℓ} ⊂ G0 is the support of S, σ(S) = g1 + . . . + gℓ ∈ G
is the sum of S, |S| = ℓ ∈ N0 is the length of S, and −S = (−g1) · . . . · (−gℓ). We denote by

B(G0) = {S ∈ F (G0) | σ(S) = 0}

the monoid of zero-sum sequences over G0. Since the embedding B(G0) ֒→ F (G0) is a divisor ho-
momorphism, B(G0) is a Krull monoid by Property (c). We follow the convention to write ∗(G0)
instead of ∗(B(G0)) for all arithmetical concepts ∗(H) deﬁned for a monoid H.
In particular, we
have R(G0) = R(B(G0)), Ca(G0) = Ca(B(G0)), and so on.
If G0 is ﬁnite, then the set of atoms
A(G0) = A(B(G0)) is ﬁnite, and

D(G0) = sup{|A| | A ∈ A(G0)} ∈ N

MINIMAL RELATIONS AND CATENARY DEGREES IN KRULL MONOIDS

is the Davenport constant of G0. Let G be ﬁnite abelian, say G ∼= Cn1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Cnr , where r = r(G) ∈ N0
is the rank of G, n1, . . . , nr ∈ N with 1 < n1 | . . . | nr. If D∗(G) = 1 +Pr

i=1(ni − 1), then

(2.3)

D∗(G) ≤ D(G) ≤ |G| .

We have equality on the left hand side for p-groups, for groups with rank r(G) ≤ 2, and others (see [14,
Corollary 4.2.13] for groups close to p-groups, and [20, 5] for groups of rank three).

The next lemma reveals the universal role of monoids of zero-sum sequences in the study of general

Krull monoids.

Lemma 2.2. Let H be a reduced Krull monoid, F = F (P ) a free abelian monoid such that the embedding
H ֒→ F is a coﬁnal divisor homomorphism, and G = q(F )/q(H). Let GP = {[p] | p ∈ P } ⊂ G denote

the set of classes containing prime divisors, eβ : F → F (GP ) be the unique homomorphism satisfying
eβ(p) = [p] for all p ∈ P , and let β = eβ | H : H → B(GP ).

1. L(H) = L(GP ). In particular, k∗(H) = k∗(GP ).
2. c(GP ) ≤ c(H) ≤ max{c(GP ), 2} ≤ D(GP ).
3. R(GP ) ⊂ R(H).

Proof. The assertions on L(H) and c(H) follow from [16, Theorem 3.4.10]. Since L(H) = L(GP ), we
infer that

k∗(H) = {min(L \ {2}) | 2 ∈ L ∈ L(H)} = {min(L \ {2}) | 2 ∈ L ∈ L(GP )} = k∗(GP ) .

To verify the assertion on R(H), let d ∈ R(GP ) be given. Then there are A ∈ B(GP ) and factorizations
Z = U1 ·. . .·Uk, Z ′ = V1 ·. . .·Vℓ ∈ Z(A), where U1, . . . , Uk, V1, . . . , Vℓ ∈ A(GP ), such that d(Z, Z ′) = d but
there is no (d − 1)-chain of factorizations of A concatenating Z and Z ′. We set supp(A) = {g1, . . . , gm}
and we choose a prime divisor pi ∈ gi ∩P for each i ∈ [1, m]. Then there are a ∈ H, u1, . . . , uk, v1, . . . , vℓ ∈
A(H) such that β(a) = A, β(ui) = Ui, and β(vj ) = Vj for each i ∈ [1, k] and each j ∈ [1, ℓ] (recall that
for every element c ∈ H we have that c is an atom of H if and only if β(c) is an atom of B(GP ) by
[16, Proposition 3.2.3]). Then z = u1 · . . . · uk, z′ = v1 · . . . · vℓ ∈ Z(a) with d(z, z′) = d and there is no
(d − 1)-chain of factorizations of a concatenating z and z′. This implies that d ∈ R(H).
(cid:3)

As already mentioned in the introduction, all the sets k∗(H), ∆(H), Ca(H), and R(H), may be
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. In general, only the (trivial) relations, as gathered in Lemma 2.1, hold true and
all sets are far from being intervals (indeed, in Proposition 3.2 we will see that the sets k∗(H), R(H),
and Ca(H) may coincide simultaneously with any given ﬁnite subset of N≥2). There is an abundance of
examples in the literature demonstrating the diverging behavior of these sets. Thus we just provide two
basic examples, and since numerical monoids have been studied in detail in [6, 8, 11, 12], we restrict the
examples in this note to the setting of Krull monoids.

Examples 2.3.

1. By Lemma 2.1.3, we have k∗(H) ⊂ R(H), and we provide an example of a Krull monoid H for
which k∗(H) = ∅ but R(H) 6= ∅. Let r, n ∈ N≥2, (e1, . . . , er) ∈ Gr be independent with ord(e1) =
. . . = ord(er) = n, e0 = −(e1 + . . . + er), and G0 = {e0, . . . , er}. We set H = B(G0) and observe
that A(G0) = {W, U0, . . . , Ur} where W = e0 · . . . · er and Ui = en
for all i ∈ [0, r]. Clearly, we have
i
W n = U0 · . . . · Ur, and it is easy to check that k∗(G0) = ∅ but Ca(G0) 6= ∅. A detailed discussion of the
arithmetic of this monoid can be found in [16, Proposition 4.1.2]. In particular, ∆(G0) = ∅ if and only if
n = r + 1.

2. By Equation (2.2) we have k∗(H) ⊂ 2 + ∆(H) and by Lemma 2.1 we have k∗(H) ∪ Ca(H) ⊂ R(H).
An example of a Krull monoid H with ∆(H) = ∅ (and hence k∗(H) = ∅) but for which Ca(H) and hence
R(H) are both inﬁnite is discussed in [16, Example 4.8.11].

3. Main results

In this section we establish a realization theorem for ﬁnite nonempty subsets of N≥2 as sets of catenary
degrees (answering Problem 4.1 in [12] in the aﬃrmative), and we give the proof of our main result stated
in the Introduction.

Lemma 3.1. Let n ∈ N, (Hi)n

i=1 be a family of BF-monoids, and H = H1 ×. . .×Hn.

1. R(H) = Sn
2. Ca(H) = Sn
3. k∗(H) = Sn

i=1 R(Hi).
i=1 Ca(Hi).
i=1 k∗(Hi).

Proof. Without restriction we may suppose that H1, . . . , Hn are reduced. Then H1, . . . , Hn are divisor-
closed submonoids of H whence

n[

i=1

R(Hi) ⊂ R(H),

n[

i=1

Ca(Hi) ⊂ Ca(H),

and

n[

i=1

k∗(Hi) ⊂ k∗(H) .

It remains to verify the reverse inclusions. We may suppose that n = 2. Then the general case follows by
an inductive argument. We use some simple properties of the distance function d(·, ·) in products (details
can be found in [16, Proposition 1.6.8]).

1z′

1. Let d ∈ R(H). Then there are a = a1a2 ∈ H1 ×H2 and factorizations z = z1z2, z′ = z′

with d(z1z2, z′
ai ∈ Hi and zi, z′
i ∈ [1, 2]. Clearly, z1z2, z1z′
implies that d1 = 0 or d2 = 0, say d2 = 0. Thus z2 = z′

2 ∈ Z(a)
2) = d such that there is no (d − 1)-chain of factorizations concatenating z and z′, where
i) for
2 is a max{d1, d2}-chain from z to z′. Thus max{d1, d2} = d1 + d2 which

i ∈ Z(ai) for i ∈ [1, 2]. Then d(z1z2, z′

2 and d = d1 ∈ R(H1).

2, z′

1z′

1z′

2) = d(z1, z′

1) + d(z2, z′

2), say di = d(zi, z′

1z′

2. Let a = a1a2 ∈ H with c(a) ≥ 2, where a1 ∈ H1 and a2 ∈ H2. Since c(a) = max{c(a1), c(a2)}, say

c(a) = c(a1), it follows that c(a) = c(a1) ∈ Ca(H1).

3. Let d ∈ k∗(H) ⊂ N≥3. Then there are atoms u, v ∈ A(H) such that min(L(uv) \ {2}) = d.
Note that A(H) = A(H1) ∪ A(H2).
If u is an atom of H1 and v is an atom of H2, or conversely,
then L(uv) = L(u) + L(v) = {2}. Thus there is an i ∈ [1, 2] such that u, v are atoms of Hi and
d = min(LH (uv) \ {2}) = min(LHi (uv) \ {2}) ∈ k∗(Hi).
(cid:3)

Proposition 3.2. For every ﬁnite nonempty subset C ⊂ N≥2 there is a ﬁnitely generated Krull monoid
H with ﬁnite class group such that R(H) = Ca(H) = C, and k∗(H) = C \ {2}.

Proof. Let s ∈ N and C = {d1, . . . , ds} ⊂ N≥2 be given. We start with the following assertion.

A. For every i ∈ [1, s], there is a ﬁnitely generated reduced Krull monoid Hi with ﬁnite class group

such that R(Hi) = Ca(Hi) = {di}, and if di > 2, then k∗(Hi) = {di}.

Proof of A. Let i ∈ [1, s]. First we handle the case where di ≥ 3. Let Gi be a cyclic group of order di,
and gi ∈ Gi an element with ord(gi) = di. We set Hi = B({gi, −gi}), Ui = gdi
i , Vi = (−gi)gi, and Ai =
Ui(−Ui). Then Z(Ai) = {Ui(−Ui), V di
i } which implies that c(Ai) = di. Since A(Hi) = {Ui, −Ui, Vi},
we infer that k∗(Hi) = R(Hi) = Ca(Hi) = {di}. Clearly, Hi is reduced and ﬁnitely generated. Since
{gi, −gi} is a generating set of Gi, Hi is a Krull monoid with class group isomorphic to Gi by [16,
Proposition 2.5.6].

Now suppose that di = 2. Let Hi be any ﬁnitely generated Krull monoid whose class group Gi
has exactly two elements. Then Hi is not factorial and c(Hi) = 2. Therefore Lemma 2.1 implies that
Ca(Hi) = R(Hi) = {2}.
(cid:3)[Proof of A]
Now H = H1 ×. . .×Hs is a ﬁnitely generated Krull monoid with ﬁnite class group, and Lemma 3.1

implies that R(H) = Ca(H) = {d1, . . . , ds} = C, and that k∗(H) = C \ {2}.

Let H = H1×. . .×Hn be a ﬁnite direct product of BF-monoids. Then we obviously have ∆(H1) ∪ . . . ∪
∆(Hn) ⊂ ∆(H), but in general this inclusion is strict. It is well-known that for every ﬁnite nonempty
set L ⊂ N≥2 there is a ﬁnitely generated Krull monoid H and an element a ∈ H such that L = L(a).
This implies that for every ﬁnite set C ⊂ N there is a ﬁnitely generated Krull monoid H and an element
a ∈ H such that ∆(L(a)) = C. However, it is an open problem whether every ﬁnite set C ⊂ N with
min C = gcd C (recall Equation (2.1)) can be realized as a set of distances of some monoid. For recent
progress in this direction we refer to [11]. On the other hand, if H is a Krull monoid and every class
contains a prime divisor, then ∆(H) is an interval ([17]), and the next proposition reveals that the same
holds true for k∗(H).

Proposition 3.3. Let G be a ﬁnite abelian group. Then k∗(G) = ∅ if and only if |G| ≤ 2. If |G| ≥ 3,
then k∗(G) is a ﬁnite interval with min k∗(G) = 3.

Proof. Since B(G) is half-factorial if and only if |G| ≤ 2 ([16, Corollary 3.4.12]), it follows that k∗(G) = ∅
if and only if |G| ≤ 2. Suppose that |G| ≥ 3. Since c(G) ≤ D(G) ≤ |G| by Lemma 2.2 and sup k∗(G) ≤
sup R(G) = c(G) by Lemma 2.1, it follows that k∗(G) is ﬁnite. We deﬁne a function f : k∗(G) → N as
follows. If ℓ ∈ k∗(G), then there are U1, U2, V1, . . . , Vℓ ∈ A(G) such that

U1U2 = V1 · . . . · Vℓ ,

where U1U2 has no factorization of length in [3, ℓ − 1]. Let f (ℓ) be deﬁned as the minimum over all |U1U2|
where U1, U2 stem from such a conﬁguration. We continue with the following assertion.

A. For every ℓ ∈ [3, max k∗(G)], the interval [ℓ, max k∗(G)] is contained in k∗(G) and the function

f | [ℓ, max k∗(G)] :

[ℓ, max k∗(G)] → N is strictly increasing.

Clearly, A implies that k∗(G) = [3, max k∗(G)] is an interval with min k∗(G) = 3.

Proof of A. We proceed by induction on ℓ. Obviously, the assertion holds for ℓ = max k∗(G). Now
suppose that the assertion holds for some ℓ ∈ [4, max k∗(G)]. In order to show that it holds for ℓ − 1, let
U1, U2, V1, . . . , Vℓ ∈ A(G) be such that

U1U2 = V1 · . . . · Vℓ ,

where U1U2 has no factorization of length in [3, ℓ − 1], and f (ℓ) = |U1U2|. For every i ∈ [1, ℓ], we set
Vi = U1,iU2,i with U1,i, U2,i ∈ F (G) such that

U1 = U1,1 · . . . · U1,ℓ

and U2 = U2,1 · . . . · U2,ℓ .

Note that f (ℓ) = |U1U2| = |V1 · . . . · Vℓ| ≥ 2ℓ ≥ 8. Thus, after renumbering if necessary, we may suppose
that |U1| ≥ 4, |U1,1| ≥ 1, and |U1,2| ≥ 1, say g1 | U1,1 and g2 | U1,2 with g1, g2 ∈ G. Clearly,

are zero-sum sequences, U ′

and V ′

1 = (g1 + g2)g−1

1 g−1

2 V1V2

U ′

1U2 = V ′

1 V3 · . . . · Vℓ .

First, we assert that U ′

1U2 has no factorization of length in [3, ℓ − 2]. Indeed, assume to the contrary

that

U ′

1U2 = W1 · . . . · Wt ,

where t ∈ [3, ℓ − 2], W1, . . . , Wt ∈ A(G) and (g1 + g2) | W1. Since (g1 + g2)−1g1g2W1 is either an atom or
a product of two atoms, U1U2 would have a factorization of length in [3, ℓ − 1], a contradiction.

Now we assume to the contrary that U ′

1U2 has no factorization of length ℓ − 1. Then there exists a
1U2 has a factorization of length t, but no factorization of length in [3, t − 1]. Therefore,

t ≥ ℓ such that U ′
t ∈ k∗(G), and

a contradiction to the induction hypothesis that f is strictly increasing on [ℓ, max k∗(G)].

f (t) ≤ |U ′

1U2| = |U1U2| − 1 = f (ℓ) − 1 ,

8

Thus U ′

1U2 has a factorization of length ℓ − 1 which implies that ℓ − 1 ∈ k∗(G) and f (ℓ − 1) ≤ |U ′

(cid:3)

|U1U2| = f (ℓ).

Proposition 3.4. Let H be a Krull monoid with ﬁnite nontrivial class group such that every class
contains a prime divisor. If D(G) = 3 and each nonzero class contains precisely one prime element, then
R(H) = Ca(H) = {3}. In all other cases we have min Ca(H) = min R(H) = 2.

Proof. Without restriction we may suppose that H is reduced, and we consider a divisor theory H ֒→
F = F (P ). The Inequality (2.3) and the subsequent remark show that D(G) = 3 if and only if G is
cyclic of order three or an elementary 2-group of rank two. Since G is nontrivial, H is not factorial, and
Lemma 2.1 implies that Ca(H) ⊂ R(H) and that 2 ≤ min Ca(H). We distinguish several cases.
CASE 1: G is an elementary 2-group.

We distinguish three cases.

CASE 1.1: There is a nonzero class containing two distinct prime divisors.

Note, since H is not factorial, the assumption holds true if |G| = 2. Let g ∈ G \ {0} contain two
distinct prime divisors p, q ∈ P ∩ g. Then u1 = p2, u2 = q2, and v = pq are pairwise distinct atoms, and
we set a = u1u2. Then Z(a) = {u1u2, v2} and hence 2 = c(a) ∈ Ca(H).
CASE 1.2:

r(G) ≥ 3.

Let (e1, e2, e3) ∈ G3 be independent and set e0 = e1 + e2 + e3. We choose prime divisors pi ∈ ei ∩ P
for i ∈ [0, 3], q1 ∈ (e1 + e2) ∩ P , q2 ∈ (e1 + e3) ∩ P , and q3 ∈ (e2 + e3) ∩ P . Then u1 = p0 · . . . · p3,
u2 = q1q2q3, v1 = p1p2q1, and v2 = p0p3q2q3 are pairwise distinct atoms, and we set a = u1u2 = v1v2.
Then |Z(a)| > 1 and 2 ≤ c(a) ≤ max L(a) = 2 whence 2 = c(a) ∈ Ca(H).
CASE 1.3:

Suppose that G = {0, e0, e1, e2} and let pi ∈ ei ∩ P for i ∈ [0, 2]. Then {p2

r(G) = 2, and every nonzero class contains precisely one prime divisor.
1, p2

2, p0p1p2} is the set of

0, p2

atoms which are not prime , and hence Ca(H) = R(H) = {3}.
CASE 2: G is an elementary 3-group.

We distinguish three cases.

CASE 2.1: There is a nonzero class containing two distinct prime divisors.

Let g ∈ G \ {0} contain two distinct prime divisors p, q ∈ g ∩ P . Then u1 = p3, u2 = q3, v1 = p2q,
and v2 = pq2 are pairwise distinct atoms, and we set a = u1u2. Then Z(a) = {u1u2, v1v2} and hence
2 = c(a) ∈ Ca(H).
CASE 2.2:

r(G) ≥ 2.

Let (e1, e2) ∈ G2 be independent and set e0 = e1 + e2. We choose prime divisors p2 ∈ e2 ∩ P ,
p′
i ∈ (2ei) ∩ P for i ∈ [1, 2], and q ∈ e0 ∩ P . Then u1 = qp′
1p2
are pairwise distinct atoms, and we set a = u1u2. Then Z(a) = {u1u2, v1v2} and hence 2 = c(a) ∈ Ca(H).
CASE 2.3:

r(G) = 1, and every nonzero class contains precisely one prime divisor.

2, and v2 = q2p′

1p2p2, v1 = p2p′

2, u2 = qp′

1p′

1p′

Suppose that G = {0, g, −g}, g ∩ P = {p}, and (−g) ∩ P = {q}. Then {p3, q3, pq} is the set of atoms

of H which are not prime, and hence Ca(H) = R(H) = {3}.
CASE 3: There is an element g ∈ G with ord(g) = 2m + 1 for some m ≥ 2.

We choose prime divisors p ∈ g ∩ P and q ∈ (2g) ∩ P . Then u1 = p2m+1, u2 = pqm, v1 = p2m−1q,
and v2 = qm−1p3 are pairwise distinct atoms, and we set a = u1u2 = v1v2. Then |Z(a)| > 1 and
2 ≤ c(a) ≤ max L(a) = 2 whence 2 = c(a) ∈ Ca(H).
CASE 4: There is an element g ∈ G with ord(g) = 2m for some m ≥ 2.

We choose prime divisors p ∈ g ∩ P and q ∈ (2g) ∩ P . Then u1 = p2m, u2 = qm, v1 = p2m−2q,
and v2 = qm−1p2 are pairwise distinct atoms, and we set a = u1u2 = v1v2. Then |Z(a)| > 1 and
2 ≤ c(a) ≤ max L(a) = 2 whence 2 = c(a) ∈ Ca(H).

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let H be a Krull monoid with class group G such that every class contains a prime
divisor. Then Lemma 2.2 implies that k∗(H) = k∗(G), and by Lemma 2.1 we have k∗(H) ⊂ R(H) ⊂ N≥2.
If G is ﬁnite, then k∗(G) is a ﬁnite interval by Proposition 3.3. If G is inﬁnite, then k∗(H) = N≥2 by [16,
Theorem 7.4.1] and hence R(H) = N≥2. All assertions, numbered as 1.,2., and 3., follow from Lemma 2.1
and from the Propositions 3.3, and 3.4 (note that, if |G| = 2, then c(H) = 2 by [16, Corollary 3.4.12]).

It remains to prove Equation (1.1). Thus suppose that G is ﬁnite and D(G) = D∗(G) ≥ 4. Since
|G| ≥ 3, B(G) is a Krull monoid with class group isomorphic to G and every class contains a prime
divisor ([16, Proposition 2.5.6]). In particular, B(G) is not factorial whence c(G) ≥ 2 and c(H) = c(G)
by Lemma 2.2. Furthermore, again by Lemma 2.2 and by Proposition 3.4 (applied to B(G)), we have

Putting all together we obtain that

2 ∈ R(G) ⊂ R(H) .

k∗(H) ∪ {2} = k∗(G) ∪ {2} ⊂ R(G) ⊂ R(H) ⊂ [2, c(H)] = [2, c(G)] .

Finally, since D(G) = D∗(G) ≥ 4, [15, Corollary 4.1] implies that max k∗(H) = c(H) whence equality
holds in the above inclusions and Equation (1.1) follows.
(cid:3)

Remarks 3.5.

1. Let G be a ﬁnite nontrivial abelian group, say G ∼= Cn1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Cnr , where r, n1, . . . , nr ∈ N with
1 < n1 | . . . | nr. The equation max k∗(H) = c(H) has not only been proved in case D∗(G) = D(G) but
under the weaker assumption that

j 1

D(G) + 1k ≤ maxnnr, 1 +

rX

i=1

j ni
2 ko .

There is known no group where max k∗(H) = c(H) does not hold. The only groups known so far, which
satisfy D(G) > D∗(G) and for which the precise value of D(G) is known, are of the form G = C4
2 ⊕ C2k
with k ≥ 71 odd ([10, Theorem 5.8]). They satisfy D(G) = D∗(G) + 1 whence also the weaker condition
above holds true.

2. The set of elasticities {ρ(L) | L ∈ L(H)} has been studied by Chapman et al. in a series of papers
(see [2, 9, 3, 4]). Among other they showed that if H is a Krull monoid with ﬁnite nontrivial class group
G, then for every rational number q with 1 ≤ q ≤ D(G)/2 there is an L ∈ L(H) with q = ρ(L).

3. All results for Krull monoids dealing with lengths of factorizations carry over to transfer Krull
monoids as studied in [13]. In particular, they hold true for certain maximal orders in central simple
algebras over global ﬁelds ([21, 1]).
