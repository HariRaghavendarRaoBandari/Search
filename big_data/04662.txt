Adsorption and dissociation of hydrocarbons on metallic surfaces represent crucial steps on the
path to carburization, eventually leading to dusting corrosion. While adsorption of CO molecules
on Fe surface is a barrier-less exothermic process, this is not the case for the dissociation of CO
into C and O adatoms and the diﬀusion of C beneath the surface, that are found to be associated
with large energy barriers.
In practice, these barriers can be aﬀected by numerous factors that
combine to favour the CO-Fe reaction such as the abundance of CO and other hydrocarbons as
well as the presence of structural defects. From a numerical point of view, studying these factors
is challenging and a step-by-step approach is necessary to assess, in particular, the inﬂuence of the
ﬁnite box size on the reaction parameters for adsorption and dissociation of CO on metal surfaces.
Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) total energy calculations with the climbing-image
nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method to estimate the adsorption energies and dissociation barriers
for diﬀerent CO coverages with surface supercells of diﬀerent sizes. We further compute the eﬀect
of periodic boundary condition for DFT calculations and ﬁnd that the contribution from van der
Waals interaction in the computation of adsorption parameters is important as they contribute to
correcting the ﬁnite-size error in small systems. The dissociation process involves carbon insertion
into the Fe surface causing a lattice deformation that requires a larger surface system for unrestricted
relaxation. We show that, in the larger surface systems associated with dilute CO-coverages, C-
insertion is energetically more favourable, leading to a signiﬁcant decrease in the dissociation barrier.
This observation suggests that a large surface system with dilute coverage is necessary for all similar
metal-hydrocarbon reactions in order to study their fundamental electronic mechanisms, as an
isolated phenomenon, free from ﬁnite-size eﬀects.

INTRODUCTION

Metal dusting is a severe form of corrosion that plagues
the petrochemical industry when iron is in contact with
hydrocarbons at high temperature. The primary step
of the dusting corrosion process is the carburization of
metal surface, that is commonly described by the Fischer-
Tropsch (F-T) synthesis. Hydrocarbons react with tran-
sition metals at elevated temperature, in a so-called car-
burizing atmosphere where the carbon activity constant,
ac,
is much larger than 1. Between around 700 and
1100 K, CO and HCOH are adsorbed and dissociated
on the Fe surface [1, 2]. C diﬀuses into the metal surface
while H reacts with O to produce steam. As the carbur-
ization process goes on, C atoms deposits accumulate in
the metal to form a metastable cementite (Fe3C) phase.
At this point, Fe atoms diﬀuse into cementite and erupt
as Fe metal dust [2, 3]. As carburization is the initiating
step in the metal dusting corrosion (MDC) and is also im-
portant for cutting the emission of greenhouse gases CO
and CO2, it has been studied widely both experimentally
and numerically, with the use of various computational

approaches [1, 4–6]. The reaction between CO and Fe
surface can be broken into two consecutive processes, ad-
sorption and dissociation. Adsorption describes the pro-
cess of a CO molecule getting attached to the Fe surface.
During dissociation, this molecule decomposes into C and
O adatoms directly at the surface, with the two atoms
moving into their most stable adatom site. Adsorption of
CO is a barrier-less exothermic process. We show here,
conﬁrming earlier ﬁrst-principles study [5, 7], that ad-
sorption releases an energy near 2 eV/molecule and de-
pends heavily on the surface indexes and the symmetry
of the adsorption site. Vibrating-capacitor experiments
suggest an adsorption energy of 1.24 eV [8]. Dissocia-
tion, on the other hand, is a costlier step that requires
breaking a C-O triple bond, with a 11.2 eV/molecule av-
erage dissociation energy in vacuum [9]. The metal sur-
face catalytic eﬀect must play therefore a crucial role for
breaking this bond [3]. Earlier density functional studies
show that on Fe-110 surface, the CO dissociation bar-
rier is reduced to 1.5 eV [5]. Recent studies on 100 [10]
and 111 [11] surfaces also show similar adsorption and
dissociation energies. However, a number of experiments
suggest CO is adsorbed on the 110 surface at low tem-

perature with dissociation taking place at higher temper-
atures with an onset observed at at least 380 K [8, 12].
Therefore with a barrier of 1.5 eV, CO dissociation on a
clean Fe surface has only a negligible probability from a
thermal activation perspective. In practice, more com-
plex reaction pathways would be possible as a number
of other molecules and sites that could act as activator,
such as H and other reactive hydrocarbons and surface
defects, are generally present and could assist the disso-
ciation process [13, 14]. Recent works on the 100 sur-
face show that high-coverage presence of H increases the
rate of carburization by reducing the dissociation barrier
[13, 15]. On the other hand Cu impurities on the surface
increase the dissociation barrier and prevent C atoms to
be adsorbed into the surface [14].

Experimental studies using low energy electron diﬀrac-
tion (LEED) and high-resolution electron energy loss
spectroscopy (HREELS) suggest an upright orientation
of CO molecule when adsorbed to one of the possible
high-symmetry sites on-top, hollow and bridge, shown in
Fig. 1. However, at very high coverage, a tilted orien-
tation is preferred [10]. Energetically, at a coverage as
high as 0.5 monolayers (ML), a hollow site is preferred
for adsorption while at a smaller coverage of 0.25 ML an
on-top site is more stable [5, 7]. Due to the small dif-
ferences between the adsorption energies, computational
precision is important in calculation. However, semiem-
pirical tight-binding model calculations [16] and earlier
DFT calculations [17] show contradictory results regard-
ing the most stable adsorption site. A literature survey
of more recent works, that use standard GGA PW91 [18]
and PBE [19] functionals and meta-GGA [20], PKZB
[21], or RPBE [17] approximations, reveal that the ex-
act adsorption energy on particular sites depends on the
choice of the exchange-correlation functional [5, 11, 22].
For example, studies of CO adsorption and dissociation
on 110 [5] and 111 [11] Fe surfaces using PBE, PZKB
and RPBE methods show that the meta-GGA functional
does not provide any signiﬁcant qualitative advantage
over standard PBE-GGA. Moreover, while perturbation
techniques such as MP2 are excellent in describing or-
ganic molecular systems, they show diverging behavior
for metallic solids [23]. Hybrid Hartree-Fock functionals
are also generally rejected in the study of metallic sys-
tems because of inaccurate description of these systems
and high computational cost in a plane-wave platform.
On the other hand PBE-GGA tends to yield a consistent
relative energy between adsorption energies at diﬀerent
sites, in agreement with a number of experimental pa-
rameters such as vibrational frequencies and work func-
tion changes for CO adsorption [5, 11].

Jiang et al [5, 24] carried out extensive ﬁrst-principles
DFT studies of adsorption and dissociation of CO on
Fe surfaces in 2004-2005, using the PBE-GGA exchange-
correlation functional with the nudged elastic band
(NEB) [25] method to converge diﬀusion pathways, an

2

approach followed by a number of groups [1, 4, 11]. After
almost a decade, this topic has been revisited by many
researchers in recent years [10, 11, 13–15, 26]. There
are several reasons for this renewed interest, of which,
notable from the perspective of computational science,
is the advancement in computational power that is nec-
essary for surface calculations with the computationally
demanding nudged elastic band method. Therefore not
only the simulations of large surfaces with dilute CO-
coverages are feasible, but also the inﬂuence of impurities
and defects on these processes can be observed. None of
these later studies, however, used a dilute coverage with
a focus on the electronic mechanisms of the adsorption
and dissociation of CO as isolated processes. In earlier
ﬁrst-principles and experimental studies, 0.25 ML was
the lowest coverage studied [5, 7, 10–12, 26]. Only higher
coverages were studied due to the fact that onset of car-
burization was postulated at a dense hydrocarbon envi-
ronment that represents a high carbon activity (ac > 1).
The system-size limitations for ab initio calculations also
prevented more costly calculations with large supercells
that is required for dilute coverages. A recent study on
the speciﬁc problem of coverage-dependence of CO reac-
tion with various Fe surfaces show that the dissociation
barrier is reduced for lower coverages up to 0.25 ML [26].
A study on 100 surface show that near saturated cover-
age (0.7-1 ML) desorption of CO becomes energetically
more favorable than dissociation [10].

With more advanced computational power and eﬃ-
cient parallel processing algorithms, some of these unan-
swered questions regarding the reaction of CO with the
Fe-110 surface can now be addressed.
In order to un-
derstand the atomistic mechanism of CO adsorption and
dissociation, it is necessary to ﬁrst characterize it as an
isolated process, excluding interaction with other adsorb-
ing / dissociating CO molecules. This is possible by
choosing a low coverage, i.e. a large surface area. A
large surface area makes computation expensive but is
aﬀordable with modern computers and is essential if the
interactions associated with periodic boundary condition
are to be avoided, allowing a better description of the
reaction mechanism between CO and Fe surface as an
isolated process.

In this work we study the adsorption and dissociation
of CO as functions of increasing box sizes correspond-
ing to coverages from 0.25 ML to 0.0625 ML using PBE-
GGA exchange correlation functional. With the 0.25 ML
coverage model, we ﬁrst establish the reliability of our
computational setup by reproducing adsorption and dis-
sociation results obtained in previous publications. With
the lower coverage models, we observe eﬀect of periodic
boundary condition on the CO-Fe carburization reaction,
showing that the molecular interaction between the CO
molecule and its periodic images is not complete with-
out considering van der Waals interactions. We show,
in particular, that including van der Waals interactions

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

DFT calculations are performed using spin-polarized
PBE-GGA exchange-correlation functional with the
plane-wave basis pseudopotential method implemented
in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [27].
Total energies are calculated with a kinetic energy cut-
oﬀ ﬁxed at 400 eV for all calculations. Grimme’s DFT-
D3 [28] method was used to incorporate van der Waals
interactions. Convergence criteria of 10−4eV/atom and
10−3˚A were selected for total energy and structure relax-
ation, respectively. A ferromagnetic (FM) bcc structure
with space group Im¯3m was used for bulk Fe. The equi-
librium bulk lattice constant was found to be 2.83148˚A.
We ﬁrst look at the reconstruction of the three lowest
index surfaces, 100, 110 and 111, to test the accuracy of
our results as well as to ﬁnd out a suitable surface for the
CO-Fe reaction. Supercells are created using a n× n× 10
simulation box, where n is the multiplicity factor of the
unit cell in the dimensions parallel to the surface. There-
fore, in terms of the lattice vectors associated with the
surface unit cells a, b and c, with c being perpendicular
to the surface, the box size is na × nb × 10c. The box
is ﬁlled up in such a manner that there is 9-10 ˚A of vac-
uum. Previous works with PAW-PBE pseudopotential
method conﬁrmed that a vacuum of 10 ˚A is adequate as
the interaction between slabs due to the periodic bound-
ary condition is negligible [29, 30]. The 100, 110 and 111
surface supercells have 13, 13 and 17 layers respectively
and therefore the corresponding vacuum lengths are 11.4,
˚A, 16 ˚A, and 9.8 ˚A, respectively. The top ﬁve layers of
each surface are free to relax in all 3 dimensions. Three
further layers are free to relax only in the direction per-
pendicular to the surface (c). The rest of the supercell
atoms are kept ﬁxed in their ideal position to simulate
an inﬁnite bulk.

For all the adsorption and dissociation calculations we
used primarily three diﬀerent supercells for the 110 sur-
face, i.e. 2×2, 3×3 and 4×4 multiples of the 110 surface
unit cell, all of which are 8 layers thick with 16 ˚A of vac-
uum space. A dense K-point mesh is automatically gen-
erated using Monkhorst-Pack grid. For the adsorption
calculations 12×12×1, 9×9×1, and 7×7×1 grids were
used for 2×2, 3×3 and 4×4 surfaces respectively. For
the calculations of the minimum energy path for dissoci-
ation a coarser set of 9×9×1, 7×7×1, and 5×5×1 grids
are used. Two additional surface supercells 2×3, and 3×4
are also considered in the study of the ﬁnite size eﬀects.
12×9×1 and 9×7×1 k-point grids are used for the 2×3,
and 3×4 surface supercells, respectively.

The surface energy Esurf is calculated using,

Esurf =

ETOT(surface) − N ETOT(bulk/atom)

2Asurf

(1)

where N is the number of atoms in the surface supercell
and Asurf is the surface area.

makes a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the adsorption energies
of CO at high coverages when the distance between CO
molecules are small. For the dissociation process, the
impact of periodic boundary condition is even greater.
We show that when the coverage is decreased from 0.25
ML to 0.0625 ML, and the dissociation barrier is signif-
icantly reduced from 1.64 eV to 0.78 eV. This implies
that the CO-Fe dissociation reaction becomes more fa-
vorable at lower coverages. In particular, we assess in de-
tails the various factors that govern the relation between
the dissociation barrier and CO-coverage, which leads us
to conclude that upon carburization, the high-coverage
systems suﬀer from uncompensated elastic deformation.
In the ﬁrst-principles calculations, the high-coverage sys-
tems are modeled with small surface supercells that, due
to the periodic image interaction under boundary con-
ditions, do not allow an unobstructed relaxation upon
CO dissociation, therefore elevating the transition state
energy. The novelty of this work is to use a large 4×4
supercell representing a very dilute coverage of 0.0625
ML, such that the fundamental electronic mechanism of
adsorption and dissociation can be observed as an iso-
lated phenomenon, free from periodic image interaction.
The observation made here with the dilute coverage has
a serious impact on the wide ﬁeld of studies on funda-
mental electronic mechanism of the metal-hydrocarbon
reactions as well as on the inﬂuence of other adsorbates
on these reactions. Our study suggests the necessity of
using a large surface / dilute coverage system for the sake
of better understanding of the fundamental processes, as
well as inﬂuence of other adsorbates or defects, as iso-
lated phenomena, before conducting these studies using
a high coverage / small supercell systems.

conﬁguration. The MEPs are obtained with 3-stage high-
precision relaxation of the path. First, a basic MEP was
obtained using conventional NEB. Next, climbing image
method was applied on this primitive path with a fewer
number of images (typically 5 per path) to ﬁne tune the
energy and position of the saddle point. Finally, we add
intermediate points in the path obtained with climbing
image to ensure that no small detail of the reaction path
is missed and the complete path is relaxed again for a
third time.

The climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB)
method [25] implemented in VASP is used to trace the
minimum energy paths (MEP) associated with the disso-
ciation of CO. In order to ﬁnd a transition state, the end-
point (initial and ﬁnal) conﬁgurations for the reaction
are fully relaxed with high precision. NEB uses an in-
terpolated chain of intermediate conﬁgurations between
the two end point conﬁgurations, connected by springs.
The whole chain is then relaxed simultaneously with a
ﬁxed spring constant until the total average force mini-
mizes under the tolerance limit of 0.01eV/˚A. In this work,
15 intermediate conﬁgurations or images are considered,
starting from an on-top adsorbed to a fully dissociated

Surface reconstruction: the choice of the system

To characterize the three reconstructed surfaces, we
consider their energy deﬁned in Eq. 1 as well as the sur-
face reconstruction parameter that describes the damp-
ing of the displacement of surface atoms to convergence.
This parameter δzn, is the change in interlayer spacing
of the nth layer from the surface, as a percentage of bulk
interlayer spacing. Table I shows the complete set of
surface reconstruction parameters calculated for the 100,
110 and 111 surfaces. A number of results from previous
works are also cited for comparison.

text, is compared with previous works.

Table I shows that the displacement is relatively small
except for the 111 surface, which has the lowest sur-
face density of the three surfaces, and for which the ﬁrst
two layers are heavily contracted. This elastic relaxation
drops below 1% (equivalent to 0.02 ˚A) at or before the
depth of 5th layer for all the surfaces. As expected, the
110 surface, with its densely-packed structure, shows the

least amount of reconstruction.

The surface energies, calculated using Eq. 1, are given
in Table II and are compared with results from selected
previous works. The values calculated in this work agree
well with earlier ﬁrst-principles works. The experimental
result, which is estimated from a solid-liquid interfacial
free energy technique [34], cannot distinguish between

from the ﬁrst-principles result when measured at ∼0K.
As with the previous calculation results shown in Table I
and II, our simulation conﬁrms that the 110 surface has
the lowest reconstruction and surface energy. It is also
the most densely packed surface given that the surface

RESULTS

Adsorption

For the adsorption of CO molecule on the 110 surface,
three possible symmetrical adsorption sites are consid-
ered: the on-top, hollow and bridge sites, all shown in
Fig. 1. Table III shows the adsorption energies for dif-
ferent sites at 0.25 ML , 0.1111 ML and 0.0625 ML cov-
erages, corresponding to a single molecule on the 2×2,
3×3 and a 4×4 surface systems, respectively. The ad-
sorption energies for the 0.25 ML is in agreement with
Jiang et al ’s results [5]. A negative sign indicates energy
gain through adsorption (Eq. 2). An on-top position is
energetically the most favourable for adsorption at 0.25
ML of coverage and lower. The CO molecule sits upright
with the C atom closer to the Fe surface (Fig. 1) in all
three symmetric sites. The C-O bond (1.17 ˚A in vac-
uum) is stretched by 4.5 - 9.1% with the largest stretch
for the hollow site. The CO molecule relaxes to a po-
sition where the C atom is 0.9-1.1 ˚A above the surface.
One can see in Table III that the inclusion of van der
Waals interactions lowers the adsorption energy and is
drastic for the higher coverage, 0.25 ML. At 0.0625 ML
mutual distances between CO molecules is larger, at 9.8
˚A, so that the van der Waals interactions are relatively
weak and the corrections due to this term in the adsorp-
tion energies are limited to 20-50 meV. Interestingly, the
inclusion of van der Waals interactions brings adsorp-
tion energies for diﬀerent coverages closer to each other.
We note that careful selection of the dispersion correc-

5

tion method is crucial as there are reports of frequent
overestimation of van der Waals interaction energies [35].
However, recent benchmarking density functional studies
show that the molecular adsorption on metal is generally
described correctly with van der Waals techniques such
as the Grimme’s method used here [36–38]. A direct
comparison with experiment to conﬁrm the accuracy of
the van der Waals technique used is not possible due to
the fact that the only available early experiment results,
with adsorption energy estimates in the 1-2 eV range,
[12, 39, 40] are not site-speciﬁc and not accurate enough
to allow us to distinguish results at the ∼10 meV scale
necessary here.

Dissociation

Once the CO molecule is adsorbed on the surface, it
decomposes into surface-adsorbed C and O atoms and
the C atom diﬀuses into the Fe surface to complete the
carburization process. The dissociation path is estimated
using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method. For the
0.25ML, van der Waals interactions are not used to al-
low a direct comparison with previous works. For 0.1111
ML and 0.0625 ML, although we have shown that van
der Waals interactions have little inﬂuence, we have in-
cluded them to capture the most precise details along
the minimum-energy reaction pathway (MEP). We se-
lect the on-top conﬁguration as the initial conﬁguration
for the NEB calculation because it is the most favorable
adsorption site as shown in the previous section. The ﬁ-
nal conﬁguration consists of the CO molecule completely
decomposed into C and O adatoms on the surface. Ac-
cording to earlier investigations [5, 41], upon decomposi-
tion, the C atom is adsorbed on the hollow site (Figure
1) with 5 Fe neighbors (4 in the surface layer and 1 in the
2nd layer). We show that the C atom penetrates 0.2-0.3
˚A deep in the surface. The O atom, on the other hand,
hovers 0.7-0.9 ˚A above the nearest-neighbor hollow site

to note that at a lower coverage of 0.0625 ML, the O
atom relaxes further from the hollow site to a so-called
quasi-threefold site [5] with a coordination number of 3.
This can be observed in the data for Fe-O distance given
in Table IV. This distortion is caused by the relaxation
of the local atomic structure under a reduced interac-
tion between the oxygen atoms and its periodic images
once the surface supercell size is increased from 2×2 to
4×4 and has a signiﬁcant contribution in lowering the
dissociation barrier. A detailed discussion is made in the
next section. For the 2×2 (0.25 ML coverage) surface
in the dissociated state, the C atom is adsorbed 0.21 ˚A
below the surface while the O atom sits at 0.71 ˚A above
the surface. This ﬁnal conﬁguration remains stable for
the three coverages. However, the C atom sinks slightly
deeper, 0.23 ˚A and 0.3 ˚A below the surface, for the 3×3
(0.1111 ML) and 4×4 (0.0625 ML) surface systems, re-
spectively. The energetics of this ﬁnal conﬁguration (D)
is strongly aﬀected by the CO coverage ratio and the size
of the simulation box. For the 2×2 surface supercell, the
fully relaxed dissociated conﬁguration is 0.46 eV higher
than the initial on-top bound conﬁguration, in agreement
with earlier reports by Jiang et al [5]. Interestingly, the
situation is reversed for the larger 3×3 and 4×4 super-
cells. For these two coverages the total energy of the dis-
sociated CO conﬁguration is found be 0.09 eV and 0.72
eV lower, respectively, than that of the initially adsorbed
CO, corresponding to lowest energy point on the whole
reaction path.

Turning to the full MEP for the 2×2 (0.25 ML) sur-
face, the hollow site-adsorbed CO serves as an interme-

to the ﬁnal dissociated conﬁguration, as represented by
B→D. For the 1st segment, we ﬁnd a similar minimum
energy path for all coverages with a small barrier of 0.07
(0.25 ML) - 0.05 (0,0625 ML) eV. For the second segment
B→D, the primary barrier occurs at the saddle point C
where the C-O bond is stretched to 2.1 ˚A before break-
ing to separate atoms. For the 2×2 (0.25 ML) system
we observe a barrier of 1.64 eV, which is comparable to
that obtained by Jiang et al [5]. Fig. 2 shows the com-
plete minimum energy path for 0.25 ML, also in agree-
ment with the literature [5]. The ﬁrst segment of the
MEP is similar for all surface supercells/coverages, lead-
ing to a metastable state at B, the 2nd segment (B→D)
of the MEP becomes distinctively diﬀerent. The primary

7

saddle point is reached, at around 5 ˚A from the initial
minimum, for all coverages, leading to the breaking of
the C-O bond followed by a sharp descent to the disso-
ciated state. The energy associated with this primary
barrier represents the dissociation barrier and are 1.23
eV and 0.78 eV for 3×3 (0.1111 ML) and 4×4 (0.0625
ML) systems, respectively (Figures 3 and 4), showing a
systematic reduction as the surface size increases. Impor-
tant parameters related to the atomic structures of the
initial, ﬁnal, intermediate states and the saddle points
along the MEP for all diﬀerent supercells are shown in
Table IV. A detailed analysis about the ﬁnite size eﬀects
and their roles in the systematic reduction of the dissoci-
ation barrier with increasing system size is presented in
the Discussion section.

A lower dissociation barrier along with a slightly lower
adsorption energy (See Table III) for low coverage sys-
tems imply that the reaction between Fe-110 surface and

CO is more favorable in a dilute coverage of CO. Note
that the reverse barrier for this reaction reaches 1.5 eV
indicating that the possibility of surface-embedded C to

react with O to form CO is much less favorable. Fur-
thermore, previously published ab initio results show a
surface-to-subsurface diﬀusion barrier of 1.2 eV for C at
a coverage of 0.1111 ML [24] which is less than the re-
verse barrier of 1.35 eV for dissociation at the same cov-
erage and much less than that at 0.0625 ML, 1.5 eV.
Since structural relaxation is less constrained in 0.0625
ML system than for a 0.1111 ML, it can be intuitively
predicted that the surface-to-subsurface diﬀusion barrier
is even lower than 1.2 eV for 0.0625 ML system and it is
energetically favorable for the surface-embedded C atom
to diﬀuse into Fe-110 subsurface than to react back with
O to form CO.

A similar study made on 111 surface [11] shows that
the adsorption energies are in the similar range as those
for the 110 surface, and it presents a 1.5 eV dissociation
barrier. However, a 0.25 ML coverage is used in this
work and therefore is assumed to be not free from the
restricted relaxation problem. The dissociated-CO state
is reported to be ∼ -0.15 eV lower than the adsorbed-CO
state, which is deeper than that for 110 surface, at the
same 0.25 ML coverage (+0.46 eV) but is shallower than
that at 0.0625 ML (-0.72 eV). The deeper CO-dissociated
state energy is a result of the open structure of the 111
surface. However, looking at the signiﬁcance of the ﬁnite-
size eﬀect presented in our work, a prediction can be
made that the dissociated state may be even deeper for
a dilute coverage / larger surface and may present a low
dissociation barrier in the 111 surface as well.

DISCUSSION

Role of ﬁnite-size eﬀects on adsorption

Adsorption at a high coverage is aﬀected by the van
der Waals interaction due to the strong dipole moments
possessed by the CO molecule. Table III shows that the
adsorption energy is heavily modiﬁed for the 2×2 (0.25
ML coverage) system when van der Waals interactions
are taken into account. However, for the 4×4 110-surface
supercell features a distance of 9.8 ˚A between periodic
images of CO molecules, the eﬀect of van der Waals in-
teractions is reduced by one order of magnitude to only
20-50 meVs. Note that we may require an even larger
supercell to completely ignore the ﬁnite size eﬀects in
adsorption due to van der Waals interactions. As the
CO molecule dissociates into surface-embedded C and O
atoms, the van der Waals interactions are weakened due
to the lack of dipole moment. They become therefore
much less relevant in the dissociation process. This can
be seen in Figure 5 where the relative energies of the
dissociated states with respect to the adsorbed state are
plotted against the supercell size with and without van
der Waals interaction. A clear pattern emerges: for the
smaller supercells corresponding to higher coverages, the

FIG. 5. Relative energies of the dissociated states (DS) and
transition states (TS) with respect to the adsorbed state with
(-vdW) and without van der Waals plotted as functions of
coverage (supercell size). One CO atom in surface supercells
2×2, 2×3, 3×3, 3×4 and 4×4 corresponds to coverages 0.25,
0.1666, 0.1111, 0.0833 and 0.0625 monolayers, respectively.
Also shown are the surface areas for these supercells with
minimum molecular distances for adsorbed CO molecules in
parentheses. The minimum energy adsorption state, i.e. the
on-top site adsorbed conﬁguration, is considered for all sys-
tems.

relative energy of the dissociated states are higher when
van der Waals interaction is included. This behavior is
not caused by the van der Walls interactions. It can be
explained rather by the modiﬁcation in the energy of ad-
sorption state with respect to which the relative energy is
calculated with. This diﬀerence decreases systematically
as the system size — and therefore the CO-CO periodic
image separation— increases. The energy changes of the
dissociated states upon inclusion of van der Waals are
minuscule due to the lack of dipole moment that was
provided by the CO molecule for the adsorbed state. At
the transition state, in particular, van der Waals interac-
tions are barely noticeable. Other ﬁnite-size eﬀects also
contribute to the adsorption energy: the lattice defor-
mation of the surface around the adsorbed CO molecule.
However, for a densely packed surface such as 110, this
deformation is less than 10% and is limited to the 1st
nearest neighbor.

Finite-size eﬀect on dissociation

In order to understand the signiﬁcance of the large
ﬁnite size eﬀect on the dissociation of CO, we study
and analyze the factors that are related to the periodic
boundary conditions and dictate the energy change in
the transition state. Figure 5 depicts the transition state
energies relative to the initial minimum. This energy rep-

resents the energy barrier for dissociation and we can see
that it follows the same pattern as the relative energy of
the ﬁnal minimum corresponding to the dissociated state.
We know that the transition state represents the C-O
bond severing by catalytic reaction with Fe [5, 11, 13].
From an electronic structure perspective, there are two
simultaneous mechanisms that enable the C-O bond sev-
ering: 1) binding of the C atoms with strong covalent
bonds to the most stable conﬁguration (in this case hol-
low site) on the Fe surface and 2) compensation of the
high electron aﬃnity of the O atom by charge transfer
from the surface to the O atom [15]. Here, we focus on
the eﬀect of the periodic boundary conditions on these
two mechanisms. Regarding the C-Fe bond formation,
Table IV shows that at the transition state, the C atom
is already embedded in the Fe lattice (dC = 0.04 - 0.16
˚A), and it travels deeper in the dissociated state (dC =
0.21 - 0.3 ˚A). Furthermore, for larger systems, the lattice
can relax further, providing a deeper penetration of the
C atom to a more stable atomic position (Table IV) with
higher Fe-C electronic overlaps, eventually decreasing the
energy threshold for the C-O bond severing. Once the
C atom is embedded into the surface, it creates a large
deformation in the Fe lattice, which interacts with its pe-
riodic images. This interaction, namely C-C interaction,
is well known and there are a number of contributing fac-
tors to this interaction given by: 1) the short range inter-
molecular electrostatic interaction, 2) medium and long
range elastic deformation, and 3) long range contribu-
tions due to a magnetic anisotropy [42]. The ﬁrst factor
is a component of the van der Waals interactions and we
already discussed it to be a purely surface phenomenon.
Electrostatic interactions between periodic images of C
and O surface adatoms are short ranged in the dense
Fe lattice and vanish within the ﬁrst nearest neighbor.
The magnetic contribution is commonly orders of mag-
nitude weaker than the elastic contribution [43] and can
be ignored as well. Medium-range elastic interactions are
the most relevant for the coverages we are studying here
[42, 44].

Detailed analysis of C-C interaction in α-iron provided
by Mou and Aaronson [44] shows that the elastic inter-
action is in a inverse-cubic relation with the distance be-
tween the two carbon interstitial atoms. These analytical
studies were made for C interstitial in bulk iron but the
nature of C-C interaction is expected to remain similar
as we have shown in Table V that the average deforma-
tion caused by C insertion in the surface is comparable
to that in a bulk. The C-C distance in the periodic su-
percells used here for 0.25 ML and 0.0625 ML coverages,
i.e. 2 × 2 and 4 × 4, are 4.9 and 9.8 ˚A, respectively,
which is a factor of two diﬀerence. Therefore, accord-
ing to the inverse-cubic relation, the C-C interaction in
the larger supercell/lower coverage is one order of mag-
nitude smaller than that in the smaller supercell/higher
coverage, leading to signiﬁcant energy and structural dif-

ferences between the two cell sizes. In order to compare
the amount of deformation upon C-insertion in the two
systems with bulk, we deﬁne the relative deformation
factors which are the percentage change in the Fe-Fe dis-
tance across the inserted C atom. Note that the surface
hollow site, where the C atom is adsorbed, is equivalent
to an octahedral interstitial site in bulk bcc structure. All
octahedral interstitial sites as well as the surface hollow
site have two diﬀerent distances between the Fe neigh-
bors surrounding it. This is represented by a schematic
diagram in Fig. 6. If the distance between the Fe atoms
are l1 and l2 across the octahedral cage, then upon C-
insertion, the shorter distance l1 expands to l′
1 while the
longer l2 slightly shrinks to l′
2. The deformation factors
are deﬁned by the percentage change of this distance.

Table V shows that there are large displacements in the
primary nearest neighbors of the C atom, Fe1 (see Fig.
6), increasing the distance across the adatom/interstitial
site 23-24% of the distance. On the other hand, distance
between the second nearest Fe- neighbors (Fe2) decreases.
For the surface systems, the contractions in the second
nearest neighbors (Fe2 in Fig. 6) are larger. However, we
note that deformations are not unlike that for the bulk
and the amount of deformations in the 4× 4 supercell are
close to that of the large bulk systems. It is expected that
the deformation should be larger for the surface adatoms
than for bulk interstitials due to the presence of more
degrees of freedom. A systematic convergence in δi can
be observed, which is almost linear with the supercell’
sizes with isotropic C-coverage ( 2 × 2, 3 × 3, and 4 × 4).
Note that the systems described in Table V are similar to
the dissociated state and the converging pattern of the

system is chosen with one C atom in the most stable hollow
site, and is equivalent to the dissociated state. Systems with
increasing sizes are compared as reﬂected into the distance of
C and its periodic images (dC−C ). δ1 and δ2 represent the
percentage change of the two symmetric Fe-Fe distances (see
Fig. 6) for the nearest neighbors of the C adatoms for surface
or interstitial for bulk. dC represents the vertical depth of a
C atom from the surface.

deformations is directly reﬂected in the relative energy
of the dissociated states shown in Figure 5. In order to
put the amount of deformation into perspective we com-
pare with a larger 4 × 4 × 4 bulk system with 128 atoms
and a C interstitial (from literature [45]) These deforma-
tions are large when applied to smaller periodic systems.
Restricted from propagating, the uncompensated elastic
energy results in a higher energy state and is precisely one
of the major reasons of higher transition and dissociated
states for the small systems.

As we identify the surface-embedded C-C interaction
as one of the major contributor for reducing the dissoci-
ation barrier in dilute coverage Fe-CO systems, we must
remember that a similar interaction occurs in any metal-
hydrocarbon reaction where one or more adsorbate atom
dissociate to get embedded in the host surface lattice.
Therefore the ﬁnite-size eﬀect we observe may have a
signiﬁcant impact in a wider ﬁeld of study involving a
similar reaction mechanism and it is highly recommended
that a study using large surface systems with dilute cov-
erage must be pursued to understand the fundamental
electronic and atomic mechanisms for all such reactions.
This bias is also present in the study of the inﬂuence
of external adsorbates and defects on the reaction such
that the eﬀect of the external adsorbates are understood
as isolated processes, free of ﬁnite-size eﬀects. Here also,
a higher-coverage study must accompany an estimate of
the size eﬀects such that the contribution of the reactants
and ﬁnite-size eﬀects can be separated.

distance becomes smaller. A better relaxed lattice allows
the O atom to move closer to the surface, which enables
a better charge transfer to compensate the high electron
aﬃnity of the O atom. This enables the C-O bond sev-
ering at a lower energy. As mentioned earlier, for the
4×4 surface system, the O atom eventually moves from
the hollow site (dF e−O =1.96 ˚A) to the less symmetric
quasi-threefold site (dF e−O =1.82 ˚A) with 3 close-packed
Fe neighbors. This site oﬀers a lower energy and a better
charge compensation for the O adatom. Also the large
electron aﬃnity of the O atom restricts the C atom from
forming strong covalent bonds with the Fe atoms. Bet-
ter relaxed larger systems allows the O atom to displace
further from the C atom, therefore rendering both the
transition and dissociated states more stable.

It is inferred that at the low 0.0625 ML coverage associ-
ated with the 4×4 surface supercell, the eﬀect of periodic
boundary condition or ﬁnite size eﬀects is considerably
reduced. However, we must stress that the 4 × 4 super-
cell is not completely free of ﬁnite size eﬀects regarding
both the van der Waals interaction in adsorption and C-C
elastic interaction in dissociation of CO but is a sustain-
able compromise between accuracy and computational
cost. High CO coverage systems can be modelled by
adding more than one CO molecule on the 4×4 surface
supercell. With 4 CO molecules on the 4×4 supercell,
we have reproduced identical results with a 2×2 super-
cell and one CO molecule representing the same cover-
age of 0.25 ML.This test conﬁrms that the true origin of
the size eﬀects in adsorption and dissociation are CO-CO
molecular or C-C elastic interactions, respectively. How-
ever, the large cell increases the number of degrees of
freedom and allows lower symmetries that can also con-
tribute to reduce elastic eﬀects. This overall behavior is
an important question and is particularly important if
the eﬀect of an external inﬂuence such as adsorbates or
defects on the CO-Fe reaction are studied using a sin-
gle supercell. The nature of ﬁnite-size eﬀects described
here are very general and may be applied to a number of
other similar metal-hydrocarbon reaction systems but is
yet unknown. We are currently working to address these
questions and hope to come up with a more generalized
picture in the near future. For a more accurate descrip-
tion of the hydrocarbon dissociation on complex metal
surface systems including impurities and defects we are
also working on developing semi-empirical and on-the-ﬂy
kinetic Monte-Carlo techniques alongside DFT to search
for the minimum-energy dissociation paths.

CONCLUSIONS

The role of the oxygen atom at the transition state is
also impacted by the ﬁnite-size eﬀects. Table IV shows
that for the larger systems the C- O distances in the tran-
sition and dissociated states are larger, while the Fe-O

Using PBE-GGA functional in DFT we calculate ad-
sorption and dissociation parameters for CO on Fe-110
surface. We show that the widely used 2×2 110 sur-
face supercell system associated with 0.25 ML coverage

is strongly aﬀected by ﬁnite-size eﬀects. In a 2× 2 super-
cell, inclusion of van der Waals interactions changes the
adsorption energies by about 0.2 eV, an eﬀect which was
overlooked in previous studies. Moving to lower cover-
ages of 0.1111 ML and 0.0625 ML using 3 × 3 and 4 × 4
surface supercells, respectively, allowed us to study ad-
sorption and dissociation as isolated processes with sig-
niﬁcantly decreased size eﬀects. For 4 × 4 supercells,
the eﬀect of van der Waals interactions is one order of
magnitude smaller than that in 2×2. However, van der
Waals interactions do not aﬀect the dissociation: at the
transition state, the CO molecule is decomposed and the
source of van der Waals interaction, the large dipole mo-
ment of CO, vanishes. On the other hand, free relaxation
of the C-adsorbed lattice becomes the crucial element in
dissociation as at the transition state the C atom gets em-
bedded in the Fe surface. A large surface supercell allows
an unobstructed relaxation of the surface Fe atoms with
the C atom inserted, which reduces the uncompensated
elastic energies originated from the periodic boundary
condition. Furthermore, the relaxed lattice allows the O
adatom to a reside in a more stable chemical environ-
ment. As a result, a low-energy transition state appears,
associated with a much lower dissociation barrier, 0.78
eV for 0.0625 ML compared to 1.64 eV for the 0.25 ML
coverage. This indicates that in larger simulation cells,
corresponding to lower coverage, the CO-Fe-110 reaction
is signiﬁcantly more favourable than that had been es-
timated before. However, a similar ﬁnite-size eﬀect on
dissociation may occur in any metal-hydrocarbon reac-
tion where one or more adsorbate atoms are inserted in
the host lattice and therefore it is of paramount impor-
tance to assess the size eﬀects using large surface systems
in order to understand the detailed mechanism of the re-
action as an isolated phenomenon, before proceeding to
understand the inﬂuence of defect and impurities on these
processes.
