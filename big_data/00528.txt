ABSTRACT
We present a renewed look at M31’s Giant Stellar Stream along with the nearby structures
Stream C and Stream D, exploiting a new algorithm capable of ﬁtting to the red giant branch
(RGB) of a structure in both colour and magnitude space. Using this algorithm, we are able to
generate probability distributions in distance, metallicity and RGB width for a series of sub-
ﬁelds spanning these structures. Speciﬁcally, we conﬁrm a distance gradient of approximately
20 kpc per degree along a 6 degree extension of the Giant Stellar Stream, with the farthest
subﬁelds from M31 lying ∼ 120 kpc more distant than the inner-most subﬁelds. Further, we
ﬁnd a metallicity that steadily increases from −0.7+0.1
−0.1 dex along the inner half
of the stream before steadily dropping to a value of −1.0+0.2
−0.2 dex at the farthest reaches of our
coverage. The RGB width is found to increase rapidly from 0.4+0.1
−0.1 dex in the
inner portion of the stream before plateauing and decreasing marginally in the outer subﬁelds
of the stream. In addition, we estimate Stream C to lie at a distance between 794 and 862 kpc
and Stream D between 758 kpc and 868 kpc. We estimate the median metallicity of Stream
C to lie in the range −0.7 to −1.6 dex and a metallicity of −1.1+0.3
−0.2 dex for Stream D. RGB
widths for the two structures are estimated to lie in the range 0.4 to 1.2 dex and 0.3 to 0.7
dex respectively. In total, measurements are obtained for 19 subﬁelds along the Giant Stellar
Stream, 4 along Stream C, 5 along Stream D and 3 general M31 spheroid ﬁelds for compar-
ison. We thus provide a higher resolution coverage of the structures in these parameters than
has previously been available in the literature.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Giant Stellar Stream (GSS - also known as the Giant South-
ern Stream) constitutes a major substructure in the halo of our
neighbor galaxy M31. It was discovered in 2001 from a sur-
vey of the southeastern inner halo of M31 undertaken with
the Wide Field Camera on the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope
(Ibata et al. 2001; Ferguson et al. 2002). Followup observations

⋆ E-mail: anthony conn@hotmail.com

with the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) further
revealed the enormous extent of the stream, spanning at least 4◦ of
sky (McConnachie et al. 2003; Ibata et al. 2007). This corresponds
to a projected size in excess of 50 kpc at M31 halo distances. A
high-density stellar stream of these proportions is a structure sel-
dom seen in the Local Group and its importance for understanding
the evolution of the M31 system cannot be overestimated.

The GSS has proven to exhibit a complex morphology, with
a wide spread in metallicities and evidence for more than one stel-
lar population. Based on stellar isochrone ﬁtting, Ibata et al. (2007)

2

found evidence for a more metal rich core, surrounded by a sheath
of bluer metal poor stars, which combine to produce a luminosity of
1.5 ×108 L⊙ (a total absolute magnitude of MV ≈ −15.6). Similarly,
studies such as Kalirai et al. (2006) and later Gilbert et al. (2009)
ﬁnd two kinematically separated populations in several inner ﬁelds
of the stream, using data obtained with the DEIMOS spectrograph
on the 10m Keck II telescope. Gilbert et al. (2009) again report a
more metal poor envelope enclosing the core. Guhathakurta et al.
(2006) use data from the same source to deduce a mean metallicity
of [Fe/H] = −0.51 toward the far end of the stream, suggesting
the GSS is slightly more metal rich than the surrounding halo stars
in this region. Using deep photometry obtained of an inner stream
ﬁeld via the Hubble Space Telescope’s Advanced Camera for Sur-
veys, Brown et al. (2006) compare their data with isochrone grids
to ascertain a mean age of ∼ 8.8 Gyr and a mean metallicity of
[Fe/H] = −0.7 (slightly more metal poor than the spheroid popu-
lation studied) but note a large spread in both parameters. Further
to this, Bernard et al. (2015) have shown that star formation in the
stream started early and quenched about 5 Gyr ago, by which time
the metallicity of the stream progenitor had already reached Solar
levels. On the basis of this, they propose an early type system as the
stream progenitor, perhaps a dE or spiral bulge. Detailed age and
metallicity distributions are also included in this contribution.

By combining distance estimates for the stream, particularly
those presented in McConnachie et al. (2003), with kinematic data,
it is possible to constrain the orbit of the stream progenitor, and
also to measure the dark matter halo potential within the orbit.
Numerous studies have been dedicated to these aims, such as that
of Font et al. (2006) which uses the results of Guhathakurta et al.
(2006) to infer a highly elliptical orbit for the progenitor, viewed
close to edge-on. Both Ibata et al. (2004) and, more recently,
Fardal et al. (2013) have obtained mass estimates for M31 using
the GSS, with the latter incorporating a mass estimate for the pro-
genitor comparable to the mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Whilst

in
McConnachie et al. (2003) has been of great beneﬁt
to past
studies, a more extensive data set, namely the Pan-Andromeda
Archaeological Survey (PAndAS - McConnachie et al. 2009) is
now available. This data set provides comprehensive coverage
along the full extent of the GSS, as well as other structures in the
vicinity, notably Stream C and Stream D (Ibata et al. 2007). Stream
C is determined in that study to be a little brighter and substantially
more metal rich than Stream D. Both streams exhibit distinct
properties to the GSS and hence must be considered separate
structures, despite their apparent intersection with the GSS on
the sky. Given the reliance of the aforementioned orbital studies
on high quality distance and metallicity information, and given
the prominent role played by stellar streams as diagnostic tools
within the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation, it is highly
advantageous to further constrain the distance and metallicity
as a function of position along the stream using these data. The
following sections hence outline the results of a new tip of the red
giant branch (TRGB) algorithm as applied to subﬁelds lining the
GSS and streams C and D. In section §2, we provide a description
of this method, in §3 we present the results of this study and in §4
and §5 we conclude with a discussion and summary respectively.
Note that this publication forms part of a series focusing on key
substructure identiﬁed in the M31 outer halo. This series includes
Bate et al. (2014), Mackey et al. (2014) and McMonigal et al.
(2016).

2 A NEW TWO-DIMENSIONAL TRGB ALGORITHM

Obtaining distances at closely spaced intervals along the Giant Stel-
lar Stream has proven quite challenging, owing largely to the con-
trast of the stream with respect to the surrounding M31 halo stars,
and also due to the wide spread in metallicities. Whilst the TRGB
method presented in Conn et al. (2011) and Conn et al. (2012) pro-
vided the basis for the method we employ here, that method has its
niche in application to metal poor populations with a low spread
in metallicities. Hence for the GSS, a signiﬁcant adaptation was
necessary, as now discussed.

In the earlier method, the luminosity function of the object in
question was modeled using a truncated power law to represent the
contribution from the object’s red giant branch (RGB), as per Eq.
1:

Distances and Metallicities along the Giant Stellar Stream

Using the set of Dartmouth isochrones as generated for any
given age, we essentially have a ﬁeld of points in 2D (i.e. those cor-
responding to the color and magnitude of a particular mass value
within a given isochrone) which form the framework of our model.
Each of these points can then be scaled relative to each other point,
thus adding a third dimension which represents the model height or
density at that location in the CMD. This model height can then be
manipulated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
by altering a number of parameters, as outlined below. The model
surface in between the resulting points is then interpolated by tak-
ing adjacent sets of 3 points and ﬁtting a triangular plane segment
between them.

In order to manipulate the model height at each point in color-
magnitude space, 3 parameters are implemented. The ﬁrst is the
slope of a power law a applied as a function of i-band magnitude,
as per Eq 1. The second and third denote the centre and width of
a Gaussian weighting distribution applied as a function of metal-
licity (i.e. a function of both colour and magnitude). The slope
parameter a is a convenient, if crude measure for accounting for
the increase in the stellar population as you move faint-ward from
the TRGB. Signiﬁcant time was invested in an eﬀort to devise a
more sophisticated approach taking into account the speciﬁc tracks
of the isochrones, but the simplest approach of applying the slope
directly as a function of i-band magnitude remained the most eﬀec-
tive and hence was used for all ﬁts presented in this contribution.
The Gaussian distribution applied as a function of metallicity is
used to weight each isochrone based on the number of object stars
lying along that isochrone. Each isochrone is hence given some
constant height along all its constituent masses, with the slope pa-
rameter being used to discriminate between model heights within a
single isochrone. The isochrones are weighted as follows:

Wiso = exp −

([Fe/H]iso − [Fe/H]0)2

2 × w2

RGB

!

(2)

where Wiso is the weight applied to isochrone iso, [Fe/H]0 is the
central metallicity of the population, [Fe/H]iso is the metallicity of
the isochrone being weighted, and wRGB is the one sigma spread in
the metallicity of the isochrones, which we shall refer to as the RGB
width. We note that the metallicity distribution function can be far
from Gaussian, but nevertheless hold that this simpliﬁed model is
both eﬃcient and adequate in its simplicity. In particular, the dis-
tribution for the general M31 spheroid is far from Gaussian and
hence this component is essentially folded into the normalization
of the ﬁeld contamination. Our ﬁtted streams are in contrast repre-
sented by far more Gaussian distribution functions, and hence are
ﬁtted as the signal component by our algorithm.

With the model CMD for the object constructed in the afore-
mentioned fashion, we now require the addition of a contamination
model component. Here we use the PAndAS contamination mod-
els as provided in Martin et al. (2013). Essentially they provide a
measure of the intensity of the integrated Milky Way contamina-
tion in any given pixel in the PAndAS survey. Likewise, they allow
the user to generate a model contamination CMD for any pixel in
the survey. Whilst it is possible to derive a measure of the object-to-
contamination ratio directly from these models, we ﬁnd that given
the low contrast in many of the GSS subﬁelds, it is preferable to ﬁt
this ratio as a free parameter determined by the MCMC process.

To generate our MCMC chains, we employ the Metropolis-
Hastings algorithm. In summary, we determine the likelihood
Lproposed of the model for a given set of parameters and compare
with the likelihood of the most recent set of parameters in the chain
Lcurrent. We then calculate the Metropolis Ratio r:

GSS3 of the GSS. Red, green and blue segments of the distribution denote
Gaussian 1σ (68.2 %), 90% and 99% credibility intervals respectively.

L(m > mT RGB) = 10a(m−mT RGB )
L(m < mT RGB) = 0

(1)

where L represents the probability of ﬁnding a star at a given mag-
nitude, m is the (CFHT) i-band magnitude of the star in question,
mT RGB is the TRGB magnitude and a is the slope of the power law.
To this power law was then added a polynomial ﬁt to the lumi-
nosity function of a nearby ﬁeld chosen to represent the contam-
ination from non-object stars in the object ﬁeld. This contamina-
tion component was then scaled relative to the object RGB compo-
nent based on a comparison of the stellar density between the ob-
ject and contamination ﬁelds. As this method is solely concerned
with the i-band magnitude of a star, and does not take into account
its color information, it is eﬀectively a one-dimensional method
in two-dimensional color-magnitude space. This means that the
only metallicity information incorporated into the ﬁt is that from
the color-cut imposed on the stars beforehand. The dependence
of the CFHT i-band TRGB magnitude on metallicity becomes an
important consideration however for metallicities greater than −1
(see for example Fig. 6 of Bellazzini 2008 for the SDSS i-band
which is comparable). For this reason, we have developed a two-
dimensional approach to identifying the TRGB, one that incorpo-
rates a star’s position in both color and magnitude space into the
ﬁtted model.

For our two-dimensional model of the object RGB, we draw
our basis from the isochrones provided in the Dartmouth Stellar
Evolution Database (Dotter et al. 2008). Therein are provided the
necessary theoretical isochrones for the CFHT i-band and g-band
photometry provided by the PAndAS survey. Within this database,
isochrones are provided for a range of ages (1 6 age 6 15
Gyr), metallicities (−2.5 6 [Fe/H] 6 0.5), helium abundances
y and alpha-enhancement [α/Fe] values. For use with our algo-
rithm, we have generated a large set of 2257 isochrones in CFHT
i vs g − i space with [Fe/H] = −2.50, −2.45, ..., 0.50 for each of
age = 1.00, 1.25, ..., 5.00 Gyr where age 6 5 Gyr and age =
5.5, 6.0, ..., 15.0 Gyr where age > 5 Gyr. All isochrones are gen-
erated with y = 0.245 + 1.5z and [α/Fe] = 0.00. The model RGB
can then be constructed via an interpolation of the isochrone grid
corresponding to a given age.

and accept the proposed parameter set as the next in the chain if a
new, uniform random deviate drawn from the interval [0, 1] is less
than or equal to r. In order to step through the parameter space,
we choose a ﬁxed step size for each parameter that is large enough
to traverse the whole probability space yet small enough to sample
small features at a suitably high resolution. The new parameters
are drawn from Gaussian distributions centered on the most recent
accepted values in the chain, and with their width set equal to the
step size. Upon the completion of the MCMC run, the chains are
then inspected to insure that they are well mixed.

Thus, we now have everything we need for our model CMD.
At each iteration of the MCMC, we generate a model of the GSS
red giant branch by using a grid of isochrones and manipulating
their relative strengths using free parameters representing the cen-
tral metallicity and RGB width of the stellar population combined
with a parameter representing the slope in density as a function of i-
band magnitude. We then slide this model component over the top
of the contamination model component, with their respective ra-
tio set via a fourth free parameter. We restrict the ﬁtted magnitude
range to 20 6 i 6 22 to provide adequate coverage of the range of
distances we expect to encounter whilst retaining a relatively nar-
row, more easily simulated band across the CMD.

The ﬁnal ﬁtted parameter then is the TRGB magnitude it-
self, which determines how far along the i-band axis to slide the
isochrone grid from it’s default position at 10 pc (i.e. the isochrones
are initially set to their absolute i-band magnitudes). Thus it is ac-
tually the distance modulus of the population that we measure di-
rectly, since there is no ﬁxed TRGB magnitude, but rather it is vari-
able in color as exempliﬁed in Fig. 1. For the sake of presenting
a speciﬁc TRGB magnitude (as all TRGB investigations tradition-
ally have done), we deﬁne a reference TRGB apparent magnitude
(mT RGB), derived from the distance modulus assuming a ﬁxed abso-
lute magnitude of the TRGB (MT RGB) of i = −3.44. This is a good
approximation to the roughly constant value of MT RGB for interme-
diate to old, metal poor populations for which the TRGB standard
candle has traditionally been used ([Fe/H] 6 −1, see Fig. 6 of
Bellazzini 2008) and allows for direct comparison with other pub-
lications in this series. Clearly for the present study we are ﬁtting
populations that are often more metal rich than this, but it must be
stressed that this adopted value is purely cosmetic with no bearing
on the derived distance or any other determined parameter.

The age of the isochrone grid is ﬁxed at an appropriate value
determined from the literature (9 Gyr in the case of the GSS, 9.5
Gyr for streams C and D and general spheroid ﬁelds and 7.5 Gyr
for the M31 disk - all rounded from the values given in Brown et al.
2006). Initial tests of the algorithm with the population age added
as a sixth free MCMC parameter revealed that the choice of age
had no eﬀect on the location of the parameter probability peaks
returned by the MCMC, but only on their relative strengths. It was
hence decided more eﬃcient to ﬁx the age at a suitable value for
the target population, as determined from the literature.

As an additional consideration, the model RGB is further con-
volved with a 2D Gaussian kernel to simulate the blurring eﬀects
of the photometric uncertainties. We assume a photometric uncer-
tainty of 0.015 magnitudes for both i and g bands and set the dimen-
sions of the Gaussian kernel accordingly. We note that whilst in the
ﬁtted range the photometric uncertainty lies in the range 0.005 to
0.025, the tip will generally be located in the range 20.5 6 i 6 21.5

for the structures studied in this contribution, making the assumed
uncertainty value the most suitable. Any issues of photometric
blending must be resolved by excising any regions above some
suitable density threshold, although such issues have only been ob-
served at the centers of the densest structures in the PAndAS survey
and were not an issue for this study. Similarly, care must be taken
to insure that data incompleteness does not eﬀect the ﬁtted sample
of stars, which was achieved in the present study by restricting the
magnitude range of selected stars.

Finally, at the conclusion of the MCMC run, a probability
distribution function (PDF) in each free parameter is obtained by
marginalizing over the other parameters. As an example, the dis-
tance PDF for the GSS3 subﬁeld, which was obtained via sampling
from the PDF in the reference TRGB magnitude, is presented in
Fig. 2. The distance probability distribution is derived from that in
the reference TRGB magnitude using the following equation:

D = 10

5+mT RGB −mext −MT RGB

5

(4)

where D is the distance in parsecs; mT RGB is the reference TRGB
apparent magnitude, sampled from the PDF in this parameter
produced by the MCMC; mext
is the extinction in magnitudes
for the center of the ﬁeld, as sampled from a Gaussian with
a central value determined from the Schlegel extinction maps
(Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis 1998) and a width equal to 10 %
of the central value; and MT RGB is the absolute magnitude of the
TRGB. The uncertainty in MT RGB is a systematic quantity and we
thus omit it from our calculations since we are primarily concerned
in relative distances between subﬁelds as opposed to absolute dis-
tances from Earth. We hence ignore any uncertainty in the absolute
magnitude of the tip and note that all distances will have a system-
atic oﬀset of not more than 50 kpc (assuming an uncertainty of ap-
proximately 0.1 magnitudes). All MCMC runs used for the results
presented in this contribution were of 200, 000 iterations whilst the
distance distributions are generated using 500, 000 samples of the
mT RGB and mext distributions.

In conjunction with the results we present in the following sec-
tion, we also provide an appendix to inform the interested reader as
to any degeneracy between the key parameters of tip magnitude,
metallicity and the RGB width. In Appendix A, we present con-
tour plots illustrating the covariance between the tip magnitude and
the metallicity for the GSS and Streams C and D. In Appendix B
we present similar plots for the covariance between metallicity and
RGB width for the same structures. In Appendix C we present both
types of plot for our halo comparison ﬁelds which shall be referred
to in the next section. It can be seen from these plots that any co-
variance between parameters is only minor. These plots are also ex-
tremely useful for visualizing the true probability space of the key
parameters for each ﬁeld, and provide an informative compliment
to the results plotted in Figs. 4 through 7.

3 RESULTS

The results we present in this section pertain to a number of sep-
arate structures. A ﬁeld map illustrating the GSS subﬁelds and
Andromeda I exclusion zone as well as the ﬁelds utilized by
McConnachie et al. (2003), is presented in Fig. 3. The subﬁeld
placements along Stream C and Stream D are also indicated in this
ﬁgure. Our principal focus is the Giant Stellar Stream, which is
contained within our ﬁeld labeled ‘GSS’. Fields C and D enclose
Streams C and D respectively; and Fields H1 through H3 are sepa-

and all other ﬁelds pertinent to this study. Subﬁelds GSS1-GSS10 (in red)
cover the extent of the GSS, with ﬁelds M1 - M8 representing the ﬁelds
from the McConnachie et al. (2003) study. The circular And I ﬁeld is the
exclusion zone omitted from subﬁelds GSS4 and GSS5 due to the pres-
ence of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Andromeda I. Fields H1-H3 are halo
ﬁelds for comparison with the stream populations. Stream C (subﬁelds C1 -
C4) and Stream D (subﬁelds D1 - D5) are delineated in black. The annulus
used for our new M31 distance measurement is shown in grey. Field loca-
tions were chosen using enhanced brightness maps of the structures gener-
ated using models presented in an upcoming contribution (Martin et al., in
prep). Essentially, a wide range of stellar populations can be isolated on a
pixel-by-pixel basis using these models. To best reveal our target structures,
metallicity slices centered on [Fe/H] = -1.1, [Fe/H] = -1.2 and [Fe/H] = -1.3
have been used for this image.

rate halo ﬁelds adjacent to our target ﬁelds which sample the gen-
eral M31 spheroid for comparison purposes.

As discussed in §2, for each subﬁeld we obtain estimates
of the heliocentric distance, the metallicity [Fe/H] and the RGB
width (wRGB), as well as the contamination fraction from Milky
Way stars ( fcont). These are quantiﬁed in Tables 1 and 2, as are
the distance modulus, extinction (E(B − V)) and M31 distance for
each subﬁeld. Distances along the GSS (both heliocentric and M31-
centric) are plotted as a function of their M31-centric tangent plane
coordinates ξ and η in Figure 4. Metallicities and RGB widths for
the GSS are plotted as a function of ξ and η in Figure 5. Figures 6
and 7 present the distances (heliocentric and M31-centric), metal-
licities and RGB widths for Stream C and Stream D respectively.
All data points are plotted together with their one-sigma (68.2%)
uncertainties. Note that for the GSS, an overlapping system of
ﬁelds was implemented such that a given ﬁeld GSSX.5 contains
the stars from the lower half of ﬁeld GSSX and the upper half of
ﬁeld GSSX + 1. For this reason, data points are shown in between
the numbered ﬁelds in Figure 4 and Figure 5. In each of the Figures
4 through 7, basis splines are over plotted on each structure to aid
the eye - they are not intended as a ﬁt to the data. The splines are
simply a smoothing function weighted by the errors in each data
point - they are not constrained to pass through any speciﬁc data
point. Each combination of parameters is smoothed separately and
smoothing does not take into account the full three dimensions (ξ,
η, <parameter>). Cubic splines are used for our GSS measurements
whilst quadratic splines are used for all other measurements.

For the derivation of the M31 distance for each subﬁeld, a new
distance to M31 of 773+6
−5 kpc was determined via our new method,
by ﬁtting to stars within an elliptical annulus centered on M31 and
deﬁned by inner and outer ellipses with ellipticities of 0.68, po-
sition angles of 39.8◦ and semi-major axes of 2.45◦ and 2.55◦ re-
spectively (as indicated in Fig. 3). This distance is a little smaller
than the 779+19
−18 kpc determined by the 1D predecessor of our cur-
rent method (Conn et al. 2012) and larger than the 752 ± 27 kpc
determined from Cepheid Variables (Riess, Fliri, & Valls-Gabaud
2012) or the 744 ± 33 kpc determined from eclipsing binaries
(Vilardell et al. 2010) but nevertheless well within the uncertainties
of each of these measurements.

It is immediately clear, both from the large error bars in Fig-
ures 4 through 7 and in particular from the last column ( fcont) of Ta-
bles 1 and 2, that our parameter estimates for most subﬁelds are de-
rived from heavily contaminated structures. Nevertheless, on closer
inspection, much can be inferred from the estimates returned by our
algorithm. Our results support the same general distance gradient
reported by McConnachie et al. (2003), as can be seen in Fig. 4, al-
though we note a slightly greater increase in distance as a function
of angular separation from M31. We also ﬁnd no evidence of the
sudden distance increase between ﬁelds 7 and 8 of that study, and
importantly, we note that the stream appears to emerge from a small
distance in front of the M31 disk center. It should be noted that the
results reported in McConnachie et al. (2003) determine distance
shifts of each ﬁeld with respect to ﬁeld 8 - taken as the M31 dis-
tance - whereas our estimates are independent of any inter-ﬁeld cor-
relations. Our data is also the product of a diﬀerent imager to that
used in this earlier study and of a diﬀerent photometric calibration.
We also stress that the technique used in the earlier contribution did
not take metallicity changes into account on a ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld basis.
The mid GSS ﬁelds are in fact slightly more metal rich than the
inner most ﬁelds (see Fig. 5) which would yield inﬂated distance
estimates for those ﬁelds.

It is evident from Fig. 4 that our distance estimates appear to
depart markedly from the general trend between subﬁelds GSS4
and GSS5.5 as well as between GSS6 and GSS7.5. These sub-
ﬁelds coincide with the intersection (on the sky) between the GSS
and streams D and C respectively. With the exception of sub-
ﬁeld GSS4.5, each of these anomalous subﬁelds contain parame-
ter probability distributions that are double peaked, with the sec-
ond peak more in keeping with the GSS trend and thus presumably
attributable to the GSS. In the case of subﬁeld GSS5, Stream D
would appear to be consistent with the additional peak in so far as
distance is concerned, but the same cannot be said for either the
metallicity or the RGB width. In the case of subﬁelds GSS6.5 and
GSS7, the additional peak is roughly consistent with the secondary
peak derived for subﬁeld C3 in terms of distance and RGB width
but the metallicity is diﬀerent. For all ﬁelds where a restriction on
the TRGB probability distribution proved informative (namely sub-
ﬁelds GSS5, GSS6.5, GSS7, GSS8.5 and GSS9), parameter esti-
mates are provided for both the restricted and unrestricted case.
The ﬁelds are denoted in the restricted case with the symbol †∗ in
Table 1 and in Appendix A and Appendix B, whilst † is used in the
unrestricted case. Fields denoted †∗ will be represented as black
triangle symbols in Figs 4 and 5 whilst those denoted † will be rep-
resented as red square symbols. We note that even when the GSS
subﬁeld distances are determined from the full parameter distribu-
tions, they remain in general keeping with the trend when the full
uncertainties are considered.

Moving on to the outer most portion of the GSS, it is in-
teresting to observe that the distance seems to plateau and even

6

diminish beyond the brightest portion of the stream covered in
McConnachie et al. (2003), although caution must be exercised
with inferences made from the outermost subﬁelds, due to the ex-
tremely low signal available.

For streams C and D, we ﬁnd average distances of ∼ 828+9
−30
kpc and ∼ 789+26
−18 kpc respectively. We are unable to determine any
reliable distance gradient along either of these structures. In addi-
tion to Streams C and D, consideration had been given to the pos-
sibility of an arching segment of the GSS, extending outward from
subﬁelds GSS8, GSS9 and GSS10 and falling back onto the M31
disk in the vicinity of subﬁelds C4 and D4/ D5. Despite the con-
ceivable existence of such a feature based on visual inspection of
stellar density plots, no distinct population could be reliably deter-
mined in any of the ﬁtted parameters. If such a continuation of the
GSS exists, it is heavily contaminated by the much brighter Stream
C and Stream D and beyond the reach of our method in its present
form.

When we examine the metallicity and RGB width estimates
returned by our algorithm (see Figure 5), we observe an unusual
trend as we move out along the main part of the GSS. Closest to
the M31 disk, the stream is found to be moderately metal poor,
with metallicities in the range −0.7 > [Fe/H] > −0.8 whilst mid-
way along the stream we ﬁnd more metal rich stars with [Fe/H] >
−0.5. Then, as we move out still further, the metallicity diminishes
again, falling below the levels in the inner part of the stream with
[Fe/H] ≈ −1 at the furthest reaches in subﬁeld GSS10. A similar
trend is observed for the RGB width. This would suggest that the
range of metallicities present is relatively small in the inner part of
the stream, whilst increasing signiﬁcantly as we move toward the
middle part of the stream. Once again, in the outer most parts of
the stream, we observe a return to lower values, although not to
the same degree as we observed for the metallicity. Once again, we
must stress however that the contamination fraction is exceedingly
high in the outermost subﬁelds and thus the metallicity and RGB
width estimates for these subﬁelds should be treated with caution.
We ﬁnd streams C and D to be consistently more metal poor than
the GSS, with average metallicities of −1.0+0.1
−0.1 dex and −1.1+0.1
−0.1
dex respectively. They are also generally less diverse in terms of
the range of metallicities present.

When we compare our halo ﬁelds to our GSS and Stream C
and D ﬁelds, we ﬁnd a clear indication that we are indeed picking
up the signal of the intended structures. When we examine the con-
tour plots in Appendix C, we ﬁnd distributions that are markedly
diﬀerent from those of our target structures presented in Appen-
dices A and B. These ﬁelds were carefully chosen to be of compa-
rable size to our target ﬁelds, and to traverse the approximate M31
halo radii spanned by our target structures. The lack of any clear
structure to ﬁt to in ﬁelds H1 and H2 is clear from the breadth of
the distributions in all parameters, whereas clearly such poor pa-
rameter constraints are not observed for any of our target ﬁelds.
Likewise, we ﬁnd little correlation between the location of the dis-
tribution maxima. Halo ﬁeld H3 is somewhat diﬀerent to ﬁelds H1
and H2 in that it is expected to be heavily contaminated by the
M31 disk. More overlap in the distributions is found between the
H3 ﬁeld and our target ﬁelds (the Stream D subﬁelds for instance),
particularly in tip magnitude and metallicity, but the signal-to-noise
ratio is much higher for our inner ﬁelds, suggesting that any cor-
relations are real and not merely the result of contamination. We
should also note that we expect any parameter gradients across the
halo to be diﬀuse and unsuited to our method which works most
favorably with sharply deﬁned structure boundaries along the line
of sight. This is indeed exempliﬁed by the plots in Appendix C.

4 DISCUSSION

The key ﬁndings of our method lie in the spatially resolved metal-
licities and distances along the main inner-halo structures around
M31. Our metallicity measurements are consistent with all prior
published measurements. Whilst these measurements utilize data
from a variety of instruments, we note that our method was not
tuned to be consistent with any of these prior results.

The initial discovery of the GSS by Ibata et al. (2001) in the
Issac Newton Telescope (INT) Survey measured a metallicity of
slightly higher than [Fe/H] = −0.71 at a position consistent with
our innermost GSS subﬁelds (GSS1 to GSS3). Of the 16 Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 ﬁelds analyzed by Bellazzini et al.
(2003), those overlapping our ﬁelds correspond to our innermost
GSS subﬁelds (GSS1 to GSS3), and have metallicity measurements
in the range [Fe/H] = −0.7 to −0.5, with a tendency towards in-
creasing metallicity moving South-East, in the same sense as our
results.

Further out, at a location consistent with our GSS subﬁeld
GSS4, Keck DEIMOS spectra analyzed by Guhathakurta et al.
(2006) gave a higher mean metallicity measurement of [Fe/H] =
−0.51, matching our ﬁndings. A detailed analysis by Ibata et al.
(2014) is in broad agreement with our results, with the GSS domi-
nating the inner halo down to a metallicity of [Fe/H] = −1.1, the
lowest metallicity we ﬁnd for the GSS.

Ibata et al. (2014) also found the inner halo streams (including
Streams C and D) to be dominant in the metallicity range [Fe/H] =
−1.7 to −1.1, where our results for Stream D and one subﬁeld of
Stream C are situated, although there are also signs of a signiﬁcant
population of Stream C members in the range [Fe/H] = −1.1 to
−0.6, where the bulk of our Stream C results lie. This lends support
to the suggestion by Chapman et al. (2008) that there are two, po-
tentially completely separate populations that make up Stream C.
These populations are found separable by their velocity measure-
ments, and also by their metallicities of [Fe/H] = −1.3 and −0.7 in
the aforesaid publication, which match our ﬁndings for subﬁeld C2,
and the rest of Stream C respectively. Indeed, Gilbert et al. (2009)
also ﬁnd evidence of two populations in Stream C, separable into
a more metal rich component ([Fe/H]mean = −0.79 ± 0.12 dex)
and metal poor component ([Fe/H]mean = −1.31 ± 0.18 dex). We
caution however that our detection of two populations is tentative
and independent velocity measurements for our ﬁeld locations are
warranted if a clear distinction is to be conﬁrmed. Chapman et al.
(2008) additionally measured the metallicity of Stream D to be
[Fe/H] = −1.1 ± 0.3, in good agreement with our results.

A key ﬁnding of this paper is the extraordinary extent of the
GSS to the South-East, reaching a full degree further away from
M31 in projection than previously measured, at a 5.5 degree sepa-
ration for subﬁeld GSS10.

Fardal et al. (2008) was able to ﬁnd a model for the GSS which
suﬃciently matched observations of some of the inner structures,
however the low velocity dispersions, physical thickness and nar-
row metallicity ranges of Streams C and D found by Chapman et al.
(2008) suggest that a single accretion event is unlikely to be suf-
ﬁcient to form both of these structures as well as the GSS. One
possible scenario that might explain the diﬀerence in metallicity
between Streams C and D and the main GSS structure is a spinning
disk galaxy progenitor with a strong metallicity gradient following
a radial plunging orbit into M31 resulting in the outer portion end-
ing up on a counter orbit with a lower metallicity (Chapman et al.
2008). Although each new observation makes explanations such as
this increasingly contrived.

None of the current simulations of this system predict or in-
clude an extension of the GSS as far out as we ﬁnd it, or the
existence of any arching segment to the GSS (Fardal et al. 2008;
Fardal et al. 2013; Sadoun, Mohayaee, & Colin 2014). Although
the latest simulations of Fardal et al. (2013) include distances for
the main GSS, which while consistent with the distances presented
by McConnachie et al. (2003), are also highly consistent with the
distances presented here, particularly for the innermost and outer-
most portions of the GSS. This suggests that ﬁnding a simulation
consistent with our much more restrictive distance constraints for
the GSS may only require minor alterations.

Whilst our method has been very successful ﬁtting these struc-
tures, particularly considering the high levels of contamination in
this region (over 85 per cent for most subﬁelds), it is in some in-

stances diﬃcult to resolve all the populations, especially for the
fainter structures. Some additional information will be gleaned by
running a full multi-population ﬁt (Martin et al in prep), but to
fully uncover the history of this system, we will need detailed sim-
ulations of the formation and evolution of the GSS and associ-
ated structures. These simulations should take into account realistic
gas physics, combined with next generation observations including
wide ﬁeld kinematic surveys.

This table quantiﬁes the MCMC-ﬁtted parameter estimates for the Giant Stellar Stream subﬁelds - i.e. labelled ‘GSSX’. Parameters are given with their
one-sigma (68.2%) uncertainties. Field boundaries are illustrated in Fig. 3. Note that subﬁelds labelled GSSX.5 include the lower half of Subﬁeld GSSX and
the upper half of Subﬁeld GSSX + 1. Subﬁelds with probability peaks omitted for the determination of their best ﬁt parameter estimates (due to the presence
of prominent peaks that are inconsistent with the overwhelming trend) are denoted †∗. The alternative estimates derived from the unrestricted distributions are
denoted † and appear at the bottom of the table below the double line. For ﬁelds external to the GSS, see Table 2.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have presented the distances and metallicities for the major
inner-halo streams of M31 using the highest quality data currently
available. There is a great deal of overlap between many of these
features, making clear measurements troublesome, however the
new method we developed to ﬁt populations to the data have al-
lowed some details to be revealed.

There is a clear need for a wide ﬁeld kinematic survey of the
stellar substructure within the halo of M31, which combined with
the superb PAndAS photometric data, would allow for a complete
decomposition of these structures. This would bring a much greater
understanding of the current and past accretion history of our near-

est neighbour analogue, and would represent a great leap forward
in galactic archaeology.

The conclusion of this work then, is that the GSS, Stream C,
and Stream D, are in general extremely faint, and can not be com-
pletely separated using the currently available photometric data.
Our method however, allows for even the lowest contrast struc-
tures to be partially resolved into separate populations, providing
both distance and metallicity probability distributions. These val-
ues will be invaluable for future simulations of the M31 system,
placing much stronger constraints on the three dimensional present
day positions of the major inner-halo structures. A full population
ﬁt based on this data, will lead to a deeper understanding, and will
be the subject of a future contribution.

Appendix A Part I: Contour plots illustrating the correlation between tip magnitude and metallicity probability distributions for the ﬁelds listed in Table 1.

Contours are drawn at 10% intervals (as is the case for all subsequent Appendix plots). Fields GSS1 through GSS8 are represented here.

Plots denoted †∗ are generated by sampling only the parameter values consistent with a restricted TRGB range. The full, unrestricted versions denoted † are
shown on the next page. The restricted ranges are: GSS5†∗, 21.08 6 T RGB 6 21.18; GSS6.5†∗, 21.08 6 T RGB 6 21.30; GSS7†∗, 21.08 6 T RGB 6 21.30.

Appendix C: Contour plots illustrating the correlation between tip magnitude and metallicity (left column) and between RGB width and metallicity (right

column) for the 3 halo reference ﬁelds (see Table 2). Note that the ﬁeld H3 is much closer to the M31 disk than are H1 and H2 (see Fig. 3), hence the

markedly diﬀerent distributions.
