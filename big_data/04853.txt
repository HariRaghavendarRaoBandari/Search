ABSTRACT
The star HR 8799 hosts one of the largest known debris discs and at least four giant
planets. Previous observations have found evidence for a warm belt within the orbits
of the planets, a cold planetesimal belt beyond their orbits and a halo of small grains.
With the infrared data, it is hard to distinguish the planetesimal belt emission from
that of the grains in the halo. With this in mind, the system has been observed with
ALMA in band 6 (1.34 mm) using a compact array format. These observations allow
the inner edge of the planetesimal belt to be resolved for the ﬁrst time. A radial
distribution of dust grains is ﬁtted to the data using an MCMC method. The disc is
◦
best ﬁt by a broad ring between 145+12−12 AU and 429+37−32 AU at an inclination of 40+5−6
◦. A disc edge at ∼145 AU is too far out to be explained
and a position angle of 51+8−8
simply by interactions with planet b, requiring either a more complicated dynamical
history or an extra planet beyond the orbit of planet b.

1 INTRODUCTION

As we build up our census of nearby stars, we ﬁnd many sys-
tems that are host to both a debris disc and planets. These
systems provide interesting test cases for understanding how
planets and discs interact, the most useful of which are the
cases where the disc has been resolved, allowing us to deter-
mine the geometry of the system and look for asymmetries
in the disc (see Moro-Mart´ın 2013, for a review). Unfortu-
nately, resolved images to date have only probed the outer
reaches of planetary systems (the Kuiper belt analogues),
whereas the majority of detected planets (detected through
radial velocity and transit observations) are very close to
their host stars. This discrepancy in the measured scales of
detection of host planets and host disc has limited our under-
standing of their interaction. The advent of direct imaging
of planets is changing this paradigm as this method is much

more sensitive to planets at tens of AU. So far HR 8799 is
the only star around which multiple planets have been de-
tected through direct imaging (Marois et al. 2008, 2010),
making it a key system for detailed investigations.

Observations of the debris disc around HR 8799 go back
to IRAS (Sadakane & Nishida 1986). Detailed study of this
disc did not happen until it was observed by Spitzer (Su
et al. 2009). This resulted in a detailed SED but also a re-
solved image at 24 µm. The Spitzer observations imply that
the dust must be going out to very large radii. This lead Su
et al. (2009) to propose a model of the debris disc that con-
sists of an inner asteroid belt analogue, a planetesimal belt
between 100 and 310 AU and a blowout grain halo going
out to at least 1500 AU. Deep observations using Herschel
are also ﬁt well by this model and have a high enough res-
olution that it is possible to constrain the inclination of the
system to 26±3◦ (Matthews et al. 2014). This agrees with
some measures of the inclination of the star (Reidemeister
et al. 2009) and the likely inclination of the planets’ orbits

(Go´zdziewski & Migaszewski 2014). The disc has previously
been observed in the sub-mm using the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope (Williams & Andrews 2006), Caltech Submillime-
ter Observatory (Patience et al. 2011) and the Submillimeter
Array (Hughes et al. 2011), although none of these had the
resolution and/or sensitivity required to accurately deter-
mine the geometry of the cold belt.

2 OBSERVATIONS

HR 8799 was observed with ALMA in band 6 (1.34 mm) for
the cycle 1 project 2012.1.00482.S. The observations were
taken with a compact array format with baselines between
15-349 m. Given the distance to the star of 39.4 pc (van
Leeuwen 2007), these correspond to spatial scales of 32 and
430 AU respectively. The data are comprised of 5 separate
observations taken between 3rd and 18th January 2015. De-
tails are shown in table 1. The correlator was conﬁgured to
optimise continuum sensitivity, processing two polarizations
in four, 2 GHz-wide basebands centred at 216, 218, 231 and
233 GHz, each with 128 spectral channels of width 16 MHz
(20 kms−1).

The data was calibrated using standard observatory cal-
ibration in CASA version 4.3.1, which includes water vapour
radiometry correction, system temperature, complex gain
calibration and ﬂagging. Uranus was used as a ﬂux calibrator
for observations 1-4 and Neptune was used for observation
5. J2253+1608 was used to calibrate the phase. Calibration
of observation 2 was worse than the rest due to large wa-
ter vapour ﬂuctuations so this data was discarded from the
analysis. The total on source time is 2.8 hours. Figure 1
shows the dirty image (the inverse Fourier transform of the
observed visibilities) of the continuum emission along with
the dirty beam. These were created using CLEAN with zero
iterations and a natural weighting, taking advantage of the
multi-frequency synthesis. The resulting synthesised beam
has a size 1.7(cid:48)(cid:48)×1.3(cid:48)(cid:48). The RMS noise is best measured using
a large region far from the source so as not to be aﬀected by
any of the artefacts of the Fourier transform. In this case,
the diameter of the source (see section 3) is comparable to
the FWHM of the primary beam (26(cid:48)(cid:48)), therefore the RMS
was measured by creating a dirty image pointing slightly
away from the target (+90(cid:48)(cid:48) in declination) with a ﬁeld of
view that does not include the target. Using this method, the
RMS is measured to be σ = 16 µJy/beam. A ring is detected
at ∼5.5(cid:48)(cid:48). This ring is surrounded by negative emission and
an outer ‘ring’ is also present at ∼20(cid:48)(cid:48), both of which are
artefacts of the dirty beam.

As well as continuum, we detected CO J=2-1 emission
at a barycentric velocity consistent with that of the star (-
12.6±1.4 km/s). The emission is spectrally unresolved at our

resolution of 40.6 km/s, in line with previous CO measure-
ments showing much narrower line widths (Williams & An-
drews 2006; Su et al. 2009; Hughes et al. 2011). Spatially, the
dirty map shows complicated structure, with striping along
the NE-SW direction analogous to that reported from pre-
vious SMA observations and indicative of line-of-sight con-
tamination by the molecular cloud HLCG 92-35 (Yamamoto
et al. 2003). The CO emission is seen as a clump ∼12” SW
of the star (near the continuum ansa), which appears to
be consistent with that detected in previous JCMT obser-
vations (Williams & Andrews 2006; Su et al. 2009). Our
ALMA observations therefore conﬁrm the presence of CO
emission along the line of sight to HR8799 originating from
the HLCG 92-35 cloud.

3 MODELLING

Interferometric observations measure complex visibilities in
the u-v plane – the Fourier transform of the image plane.
Whilst it is common practice to model interferometric ob-
servations in the Fourier plane, it is more eﬃcient, whilst
still retaining accuracy, to work in the image plane as the
dirty image is simply the Fourier transform of the gridded
visibilities (see Clark 1999, for the basics of interferometry).
To ﬁnd the best ﬁt parameters of the disc and their un-
certainties an MCMC routine is run making use of emcee
(Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). The disc is modelled with 6
free parameters using a line of sight integrator method (Wy-
att et al. 1999). We assume a wide ring of dust grains be-
tween Rin and Rout with an optical depth that varies as Rγ.
The ring is inclined from face on by an angle I and given a
position angle, Ω, measured anti-clockwise from North. The
total ﬂux density of the disc at this wavelength is set by
Fν . Since the stellar emission is not signiﬁcantly detected
(see ﬁgure 1) we extrapolate the PHOENIX model (Brott &
Hauschildt 2005) ﬁt of Matthews et al. (2014) to give a stel-
lar ﬂux density at this wavelength of F∗ =17 µJy. Although
the star is not signiﬁcantly detected, there is a clear peak
near the phasecentre but oﬀset by approximately +0.4(cid:48)(cid:48) in
right ascension and −0.2(cid:48)(cid:48) in declination. This lies within
the pointing accuracy of ALMA 1 and so we assume that
this is the location of the star. For the radial temperature
proﬁle we treat the grains as blackbodies.

To accurately replicate the observation process, the
model image is ﬁrst attenuated by the primary beam – par-
ticularly important for this disc as the outer edge is poten-
tially a signiﬁcant fraction of the primary beam size and
so we are likely to lose ﬂux far from the phase centre. It
is then convolved with the dirty beam (the Fourier trans-
form of the sampling function) and the likelihood (−χ2/2)
is then calculated by comparison with the dirty image. The
high resolution of the image compared to the beam size has
the side eﬀect of introducing correlated noise. To account
for this, the value of σ used in the χ2 is modiﬁed by a noise
correlation ratio given by the square root of the beam area

run with 120 walkers and for 2500 timesteps. Uninformative
priors have been assumed for all the parameters, i.e. they
are uniform in Rin, Rout, γ, ln(Fν ), cos(I) and Ω. The best
ﬁt parameters and their uncertainties are shown in table 2.
All parameters are ﬁt to an accuracy or around 10%. This
may seem surprising for the outer edge as it extends to a
region where the signal-to-noise ratio is low, but the strong
interaction between the parameters helps constrain the outer
edge as strongly as the other parameters. The best ﬁt model,
convolved model and residuals are shown in ﬁgure 2. Three
residuals at ∼3σ are seen in or near the disc at locations rela-
tive to the star of (5.7,-8.2), (-0.9,2.2) and (-4.9,1.3). Deeper
observations are necessary to determine whether these are
real and comoving with the star. The residuals are otherwise
smooth and the RMS in the residual image is equivalent to
the noise measured in section 2. A restored image of the
disc is shown in ﬁgure 3 showing how the disc should look
to a single dish telescope i.e. removing the artefacts of the
Fourier transform.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Comparison with previous observations

The modelling of far-IR data by Matthews et al. (2014) pre-
dicts a planetesimal belt between roughly 100 and 310 AU
whereas prior sub-mm interferometric observations using
the SMA by Hughes et al. (2011) found an inner edge at
∼150 AU. Our inner edge of 145+12−12 clearly reinforces the
SMA result and is discrepant with the far-IR modelling.
This discrepancy in inner edge at diﬀerent wavelengths could
potentially be real. The shorter wavelength observations are

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

more sensitive to smaller grains. These grains are potentially
susceptible to Poynting-Robertson drag, which will cause
them to spiral in towards the star from the planetesimal belt
as is seen in other discs such as Vega (M¨uller et al. 2010).
The discrepancy in outer edge is signiﬁcant and is likely due
to the assumption by Matthews et al. (2014) of modelling
the planetesimal belt and outer halo as two distinct compo-
nents. In reality, there is likely some overlap between these
components and the ALMA observations are better repre-
senting the actual outer edge of the planetesimal belt since
the smaller grains in the halo are too faint at mm wave-
lengths to contribute signiﬁcantly to the emission.

Matthews et al. (2014) ﬁnd the disc to be oriented such
that I = 26 ± 3◦ and Ω = 64 ± 3◦ as opposed to our values
of I = 40+5−6 and Ω = 51+8−8. Whilst these parameters are
consistent at the 95% level, there is a possibility that there
is a real diﬀerence between the orientation of the planetesi-
mal belt and the small grain population similar to the warp
seen in the β Pic disc (see Millar-Blanchaer et al. 2015, and
references therein). Alternatively, it could be that emission
from the background cloud (see section 2) or asymmetries in
the disc (that have been assumed to be insigniﬁcant) are bi-
asing the model ﬁts in diﬀerent ways. Given our knowledge
of planetary system formation and evidence from our own
Solar System (Brown & Pan 2004), it is expected that most
planetary systems will be roughly coplanar unless they have
undergone an instability. The latest astrometric ﬁt to the
observations of the planets from Zurlo et al. (2016) ﬁnds an
inclination of 30±5◦. A large diﬀerence in inclination could
potentially tell us something about the dynamical history of
the system but a 10◦ diﬀerence, especially given the uncer-
tainties, is not much larger than the inclination variations
in the Solar System’s planets and disc (around 2◦, Brown &
Pan 2004).

An extrapolation of the total disc ﬂux density based
on the SCUBA and Herschel ﬂux densities (Matthews et al.
2014) predicts a value of 3.5 mJy at 1.3 mm. At F1.3mm =
2.8+0.5−0.4 mJy, the result found here is somewhat lower than
the extrapolated value and may mean that the sub-mm slope
is slightly steeper than previously thought.

Figure 2. The modelling process is conducted by taking the sky plane image of the model (left), multiplying by the primary beam and
convolving with the dirty beam to produce a convolved image (middle), then subtracting this from the dirty image to produce a map of
residuals (right). The images shown here are for the best ﬁtting model and contours are at signiﬁcance levels of ±2 and 3σ.

previously, we expect an inner edge between 100-110 AU (for
masses between 4-9 MJ ). An alternative method for ﬁnding
the orbits of the planets is to run simulations of the dynami-
cal stability of the planetary system as done by Go´zdziewski
& Migaszewski (2014). They ﬁnd that the planets must be
in Laplace resonance to keep such a packed system of very
massive planets stable. In contrast with the ﬁt of Zurlo et al.
(2016), who assumed planets on circular and non coplanar
orbits, their models involve planets on coplanar and eccen-
tric orbits, which will produce a more distant inner edge for
the disc. Although the nominal eccentricity of planet b in
their ﬁt creates an inner edge further out, it is not predicted
to go beyond 106-116 AU with the largest estimates.

In practice, the inner edge of the disc can be further out
than this as the analytical equations assume a ﬁxed orbit
whereas perturbations from the other planets on planet b
can vary its orbit, thereby varying the chaotic zone. If planet
b can reach an eccentricity of at least 0.3 (higher if the planet
mass is less than 9 MJ ) for a prolonged period of time,
then it could clear planetesimals out to 145 AU. In order
to capture these eﬀects, n-body simulations are necessary.
Moro-Mart´ın et al. (2010) ran such simulations and they
did ﬁnd that it is possible to have an inner edge as far out
as 150 AU. This may be due to variations in the orbital
eccentricity of planet b coupled with the eﬀect of the Laplace
resonance, however, it may result from the low resolution of
their simulations (one particle every 0.5 AU).

All this opens up the possibility for another planet be-
yond the orbit of planet b. Such a planet would need to be
beyond the chaotic zone of planet b to have any possibility of
being stable. Using the equations of Pearce & Wyatt (2014),
a planet at the edge of planet b’s chaotic zone (110 AU) on a
circular orbit would need to be ∼1.25 MJ to create an inner
edge at 145 AU. If it was further out or on an eccentric orbit,
the required mass of the extra planet would be lower. This is
lower than the limits from current observations, which can
only reach multiple Jupiter masses (Zurlo et al. 2016).

The modelling in this paper assumes that the disc has
sharp edges and is described by a single power law. In reality
there are likely particles within the inner edge and the radial
distribution may be better described by a rising then falling
power law or a Gaussian-like distribution. The low level of
signal-to-noise in the data does not warrant exploration of
more detailed radial distributions, but they would be un-

and primary beam corrected). Contours start at 2σ and increase
in increments of 1σ. This also shows the planets as seen in the
K2 band with SPHERE-IRDIS on the VLT (Zurlo et al. 2016).

4.2 Interaction between planets and the disc

The ability of planets to open gaps in circumstellar disks and
to carve the inner edges of outer debris belts has been widely
studied both analytically and numerically. This phenomenon
is caused by the chaotic zone a planet possesses and within
which mean motion resonances overlap. Therefore particles
in the chaotic zone are unstable and will be removed on
short dynamical timescales. The width of a planet’s chaotic
zone mainly depends on the mass and location of the planet
(Wisdom 1980; Duncan et al. 1989), but also on its eccen-
tricity (Pearce & Wyatt 2014). Consequently, it is possible
to link the location of a debris belt’s inner edge to the mass
and orbital characteristics of the belt shaping planet.

In the case of the HR 8799 system, it is expected that
planet b (the outermost planet) is responsible for shaping
the debris ring inner edge. The latest astrometric ﬁt to all
the observations of the planets is given in Zurlo et al. (2016).
Based on their orbital ﬁt and using equations (9) and (10) of
Pearce & Wyatt (2014), which gives the highest estimate of
the width of the chaotic zone of all the methods mentioned

likely to aﬀect our conclusions as the clearing of the chaotic
zone is not 100% eﬃcient and so the inner edge referred to
in the analytical and dynamical models is also not a sharp
edge.

5 CONCLUSIONS

This paper presents the ALMA observations of the debris
disc around the star HR 8799. The observations were con-
ducted in band 6 using a compact conﬁguration. Using
MCMC techniques, a parametric disc model is ﬁt to the
data. Assuming a single power law radial distribution, the
inner edge is found to be 145+12−12 AU and the outer edge
◦
is 429+37−32 AU, whilst the inclination is found to be 40+5−6
◦. The inner edge found here
at a position angle of 51+8−8
agrees with that found by previous modelling of sub-mm
data (Hughes et al. 2011) but not with the models of the
far-infrared data (Su et al. 2009; Matthews et al. 2014). It
is also inconsistent with the edge of planet b’s chaotic zone
given its current orbit. This likely means that either planet
b’s orbit has varied over time or a smaller planet exists be-
yond its orbit. The outer edge is clearly much further out
than the models that ﬁt to the infrared data (Su et al. 2009;
Matthews et al. 2014). This shows the beneﬁt of sub-mm ob-
servations, which only detect dust in the planetesimal belt,
whereas with infrared observations it is diﬃcult to distin-
guish between the planetesimal belt and the halo of small
grains being pushed out by radiation pressure. Finally, the
CO detected in these observations conﬁrms the prior obser-
vations that the CO in the cloud has the same radial velocity
as that of the star and the clump in CO is found to overlap
with the disc.
