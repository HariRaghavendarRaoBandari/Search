Abstract

We study a relativistic quantum particle in cosmic string spacetime
in the presence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld and a Coulomb-type scalar
potential. It is shown that the radial part of this problem possesses the
su(1, 1) symmetry. We obtain the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions
of this problem by using two algebraic methods: the Schr¨odinger fac-
torization and the tilting transformation. Finally, we give the explicit
form of the relativistic coherent states for this problem.

Introduction

The cosmic strings, which are hypothetical 1-dimensional topological defects
were introduced in the 1970s [1]. In the 1980s and the early 90s a strong

interest arose in connection with cosmic strings [2]. This interest is due to the
bridge that these cosmic strings provide between the physics of the very small
and the very large. It is known from the literature [3, 4] that cosmic strings
are predicted in some uniﬁed theories of particle interactions and could have
formed in one of the numerous phase transitions in the early universe due
to the Kibble mechanism. These cosmic strings could also be responsible for
the large-scale structure of the universe.

The study of quantum systems under the inﬂuence of the gravitational
ﬁeld have been of great interest in particle physics. A problem that has been
extensively studied is the appearance of topological phases in the quantum
dynamics of a single particle moving freely in multiple connected space-times.
As an example of a gravitational eﬀect of topological origin we can consider
the analogue of the electromagnetic Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect [5, 6]. This eﬀect
is provided when a particle is transported around an idealized cosmic string
[7–10] along a closed curve in which case the string is noticed at all. The
inﬂuence of the Aharonov-Casher eﬀect [11] has been recently studied in the
Minkowski spacetime, the cosmic string spacetime and the cosmic dislocation
spacetime [12]. In reference [12] the authors solved the Dirac equation and
obtained the energy levels for bound states and the Dirac spinors for positive-
energy solutions. Recently, the relativistic quantum motion of charged spin-0
and spin- 1
2 particles in the presence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld and scalar
potentials in the cosmic string spacetime has been studied [13]. The Dirac
equation of this problem was treated in reference [14] in an algebraic way.

On the other hand, the factorization method introduced by Infeld and
Hull [15, 16] has been of great importance in the study of quantum systems.
In their work, Infeld and Hull gave a systematic method to factorize and
classify a large class of potentials. However, Dirac [17] and Schr¨odinger [18–
20] established the fundamental ideas of factorization in quantum physics.
The importance of these factorization methods lies in the fact that if the
Schr¨odinger equation is factorizable, the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions
are obtained in an algebraic way. Moreover, the operators constructed from
these methods are related to compact and non-compact Lie algebras.

Besides, the existence of a symmetry group has been used to compute
the coherent states of many physical problems [21–25]. The harmonic oscil-
lator coherent states were introduced by Schr¨odinger while he was looking
for a system which possessed a classical behavior [26]. The importance of
coherent states in quantum optics was studied in references [27–30] and the
generalization of these states to any algebra of a symmetry group is reported

2

in references [31–33].

The aim of the present work is to study a relativistic quantum particle in
cosmic string spacetime in the presence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld and scalar
potential. In order to obtain the energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions of
this problem we use the theory of unitary representations and two algebraic
methods: The Schr¨odinger factorization method and the tilting transforma-
tion. From the SU(1, 1) group theory we construct the relativistic coherent
states for the radial part.

This work is organized as follows. In Section 2 we obtain the uncoupled
second-order diﬀerential equations satisﬁed by the radial components.
In
Section 3, we apply the Schr¨odinger factorization method to one of the un-
coupled equations to obtain the energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions of
our problem. In Section 4, the energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions are
obtained by using the tilting transformation and a realization of the su(1, 1)
Lie algebra which is energy-independent. In Section 5 we obtain the explicit
expression of SU(1, 1) Perelomov coherent states for a relativistic quantum
particle in cosmic string spacetime in the presence of a uniform magnetic
ﬁeld and scalar potential. Finally, we give some concluding remarks.

2 The Dirac equation for an arbitrary curved

spacetime

The metric tensor for the cosmic string spacetime in cylindrical coordinates
is deﬁned by the line element

ds2 = dt2 − dr2 − ρ2r2dφ2 − dz2,

(1)

where the coordinates (t, z) ∈ (−∞,∞), r ≥ 0, the angular variable φ ∈
[0, 2π] and ρ = 1 − 4µ is related to the deﬁcit angle, with µ the linear
mass density. Let’s consider a uniform magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the string
−→B = −→∇ × −→A = B0
ˆk. Thus, in the Coulomb gauge the vector potential can

be expressed by

−→A = (0, Aφ, 0),

Aφ = −

(2)

The Dirac equation to an arbitrary curved spacetime, in the presence of
an external electromagnetic potential and a scalar potential can be written

3

as

[iγµ(x) (∇µ + ieAµ) − (M + S(r))] Ψ(x) = 0,

with M the mass of the particle and γµ the generalized Dirac matrices, which
satisfy the Cliﬀord algebra {γµ(x), γν(x)} = 2gµν. These generalized Dirac
matrices are deﬁned in terms of a set of tetrad ﬁelds and the constant Dirac
matrices as

γµ(x) = eµ

(a)(x)γ(a).

The covariant derivative for fermions ﬁeld is given by

where Γµ is the spinor aﬃne connection

∇µ = ∂µ + Γµ,

Γµ =

The matrices γ(a) are the standard ﬂat spacetime Dirac matrices deﬁned as

It can be seen that the equations for G and F have the same mathemat-
ical form. Moreover, these equation are related by the change γ → γ − 1.
Therefore, hereafter we shall focus in the second-order diﬀerential equation
for the radial function F .

3 The Schr¨odinger factorization method

In this Section we shall use the Schr¨odinger factorization method [18, 36] to
obtain the energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions of a relativistic quantum
particle in cosmic string spacetime. To accomplish this we ﬁrst consider the
equation (27) to obtain the following equation

(cid:18)−r2 d2

dr2 + ε2r2 − 2αr(cid:19) F = −γ (γ + 1) F.

(30)

In order to construct the su(1, 1) algebra generators, we apply the Schr¨odinger
factorization to the left-hand side of equation (30). Thus, we propose

(cid:18)ρ

(31)

where a, b, c, f and g are constants to be determined. Expanding this
expression and comparing it with equation (30) we obtain

a = c = ±ε,

f = 1 + b = ∓

α
ε

,

g = b(b + 1) − γ(γ + 1).

(32)

Thus, the diﬀerential equation (30) is factorized as

where

are the Schr¨odinger operators. Therefore we can introduce the new pair of

It is easy to show that the operators B

± and B3 close the su(1, 1) Lie
algebra of equation (A.1) of Appendix. Moreover, the quadratic Casimir
operator satisﬁes the eigenvalue equation

B2F = γ(γ + 1)F.

(37)

The relationship between γ and the quantum number k is obtained by using
the equation (A.5) of Appendix. In a similar way we can obtain the relation-
ship between the group number n and the quantum radial number nr. By
comparison of equations (36) and (A.4) we obtain

k = γ + 1,

n = nr,

n + k = nr + γ + 1 =

α
ε

,

(38)

(39)

with nr = 0, 1, 2, ....

The energy spectrum for this problem can be computed from equations

(A.4), (29) and (39). Thus

E ="k2 + M 2ω2 + (M + s2)2 −

(40)

The radial function F can be obtained from an analytical approach. If
we consider the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the radial diﬀerential
equation (30) for r → 0 and r → ∞ we propose
F = rγ+1e−εrf (r).

(41)

Hence, if we introduce the new variable y = 2εr, the function f (r) must
satisfy

2ε(cid:17) = 0,

(42)
The solution for this equation is the conﬂuent hypergeometric function. Thus
from equation (41) we obtain

F = C1rγ+1e−εr

1F1 (−n + 1, 2γ + 2; 2εr) .

(43)

The other radial function G can be easily obtained by performing the change
γ → γ−1. However, it is important to note that, since both functions belong
to the same energy level, the energy spectrum of equation (40) imposes the
change n → n + 1. Hence,

G = C2rγe−εr

1F1 (−n, 2γ; 2εr) .

(44)

These functions can be written in terms of the Laguerre polynomials by using
the relationship

1F1 (−n, m + 1; x) =

m!n!

(m + n)!

Lm

n (x).

(45)

Therefore, the radial functions F and G can be expressed by the following
spinor

Φ =(cid:18)F

C2rγe−εrL2γ−1

(46)

The ground state of the spinor Φ is obtained for n = 0. However, since
n are not deﬁned if n is a negative integer, we

as

From these operators we obtain that the partner Hamiltonians-type are given

The ground state for the Hamiltonian H− satisﬁes the condition A−Φ0,SU SY =

H+ = A−A+,

In a similar way, the solution for the equation A+Φ0,SU SY = 0 is

Notice that this function is not square-integrable, and therefore, is not a

Hence, the SUSY ground-state is given by

From equations (52) and (47) we conclude that the Schr¨odinger and SUSY
ground states are the same.

The radial functions F+ and G− for the relativistic quantum particle in
cosmic string spacetime can be obtained from equation (26) and explicitly
are

G−(cid:19) = M(cid:18)F

(53)
Therefore, we have used the Schr¨odinger factorization method and the
theory of unitary representation to obtain the energy spectrum and the eigen-
function of a relativistic quantum particle in cosmic string spacetime. More-
over, we showed that the ground state of this problem coincides with the
ground state of the SUSY quantum theory.

In references [37, 38] we have studied the relativistic Kepler-Coulomb
problem and the Dirac equation with Coulomb-type scalar and vector poten-
tial in D + 1 dimensions from an algebraic approach by using the Schr¨odinger
factorization to construct the su(1, 1) algebra generators.

4 The tilting transformation method

In this Section we shall study this problem by using an alternative approach,
the tilting transformation. Thus, we can introduce the operators [39, 40]

where the operator P 2

r is deﬁned as

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

(58)

(59)

(60)

These new operators also close the su(1, 1) Lie algebra. The diﬀerence be-
tween the operators obtained from the Schr¨odinger factorization and these
operators is that the last ones do not depend on the rescaling radial variable
(which includes the energy).

In the same way it was done for the Schr¨odinger factorization, we shall
focus just on the radial equation for the eigenfunction F of equation (27). If

we deﬁne F (r) = reF (r), equation (27) becomes
e∆(E)|eF (r)i = 0,

where

γ (γ + 1)

+ ε2(cid:21) .

In this equation |eF (r)i represents the physical states and α and ε2 are deﬁned

in equations (28) and (29). We can use the operators A0, A1 and A2 to write
the equation (58) as follows

1

2(cid:0)ε2(cid:1) (A0 − A1) − α(cid:21)eF (r) = 0.

By introducing the scaling operator eiθA2 and using the Baker-Campbell-

Hausdorﬀ formula it is easy to show the formulas

e−iθA2A0e+iθA2 = A0 cosh(θ) + A1 sinh(θ),
e−iθA2A1e+iθA2 = A0 sinh(θ) + A1 cosh(θ).

(61)

(62)

11

e∆(E) ≡(cid:20)−
(cid:20)1

2

(A0 + A1) +

From these equations it follows that

e−iθA2(A0 ± A1)eiθA2 = e±θ(A0 ± A1).

(63)

Thus, from above expression the equation (60) can be written as

2(cid:0)eθ + ε2e−θ(cid:1) A0 +

1

2(cid:0)eθ − ε2e−θ(cid:1) A1 − α(cid:21)|F (r)i = 0,
∆(E)|F (r)i =(cid:20) 1
where |F (r)i = e−iθA2|eF (r)i and ∆(E) = e−iθA2e∆(E)eiθA2. The scaling

parameter θ can be chosen such that the coeﬃcient of A1 vanishes. With
θ = ln ε we obtain

(64)

∆(E)|F (r)i = (εA0 − α)|F (r)i = 0.

(65)

If we take |F (r)i as an SU(1, 1) group state |n, ki, the energy spectrum
can be obtained from this relationship and equation (A.4) of Appendix. By
remembering the relationship between the physical quantum numbers nr, γ
and the group numbers n, k we obtain

E ="k2 + M 2ω2 + (M + s2)2 −

M 2(cid:0)ωj − ρs1 − ρs1s2

(66)

This energy spectrum matches with that obtained in equation (40) by using
Schr¨odinger factorization method. Moreover, this also coincides with the
energy spectrum obtained in reference [14].

The eigenfunctions basis for the irreducible unitary representation of the

su(1, 1) Lie algebra (Sturmian basis) is [41, 42]

and the lower component is obtained by performing the change γ → γ − 1,
which implies a change n → n + 1, since both eigenfunctions belong to the
same energy level. Hence

where f (r) is an arbitrary spherically symmetric function, the physical states
can be written as

n−1 (2εr),

eF (r) = An(2εr)γe−εrL2γ+1
eG(r) = Bn(2εr)γ−1e−εrL2γ−1

n

(2εr).

Therefore, remembering that F = reF (r) and G = reG(r) we obtain

F (r) = An(2ε)γrγ+1e−εrL2γ+1
G(r) = Bn(2ε)γ−1rγe−εrL2γ−1

From equation (26) we obtain the radial functions F+(r) and G−(r) in

terms of the group states F (r) and G(r)

Therefore, by comparing this expression with equation (27) we can con-
clude that the eigenfunctions F+ and G− obtained from both methods, the
Schr¨odinger factorization and the tilting transformation are the same. The
relationship between the normalization coeﬃcients An and Bn can be ob-
tained by evaluating the ﬁrst coupled equation of (25) in the limit r → 0.
By using the formula

the relationship between An and Bn is

5 SU (1, 1) relativistic coherent states

In this Section we shall construct the relativistic coherent states for the radial
functions F+ and G− by using the Sturmian basis and the transformation
given in equation (74). The SU(1, 1) Perelomov coherent states are deﬁned
as [24]

|ζi = D(ξ)|k, 0i =(cid:0)1 − |ξ|2(cid:1)k ∞Xs=0s Γ(n + 2k)

s!Γ(2k)

ξs|k, 0i,

(84)

with D(ξ) the displacement operator and |k, 0i the lowest normalized state.
Thus, we can apply the operator D(ξ) to the ground states of the functions

This sum can be computed from the Laguerre polynomials generating func-

The physical coherent states F (r, ξ) and G(r, ξ) can be constructed from
equations (85) and (86). By using equation (69) and multiplying by r we
obtain

F (r, ξ) = Cn

G(r, ξ) = Dn

The relationship between the normalization coeﬃcients Cn and Dn can be
ﬁnd in the same way as was done for An and Bn. Since F (r, ξ) and G(r, ξ)
also satisfy the coupled equations (25), from the ﬁrst coupled equation of
(25) we obtain in the limit r → 0 that

Dn = 2

Therefore, the SU(1, 1) radial coherent states for the relativistic quantum
particle in cosmic string spacetime can be expressed in a matricial form as

In order to obtain the normalization coeﬃcient Cn we can use the relativistic
normalization given in equation (79). The integrals that arise are computed
in terms of gamma functions. Thus, Cn explicitly is

Therefore, we have constructed the relativistic coherent states for the radial
part of a quantum particle in cosmic string spacetime.

In reference [43] we have constructed the relativistic coherent states for
the Dirac-Kepler-Coulomb problem in D + 1 dimensions with scalar and
vector potentials by using the tilting transformation method. In an analogous
way, in reference [44] we studied the problem of a Dirac-Moshinsky oscillator
coupled to an external magnetic ﬁeld by using the an appropriate su(1, 1) Lie
algebra generators. This symmetry let us compute the relativistic coherent
states for this problem.

Appendix: The SU (1, 1) Group and its coherent
states

The su(1, 1) Lie algebra is spanned by the generators K+, K− and K0, which
satisfy the commutation relations [45]

[K0, K±] = ±K±,

[K−, K+] = 2K0.

(A.1)

The action of these operators on the Fock space states {|k, ni, n = 0, 1, 2, ...}
is
(A.2)

K+|k, ni =p(n + 1)(2k + n)|k, n + 1i,
K−|k, ni =pn(2k + n − 1)|k, n − 1i,

(A.4)
where |k, 0i is the lowest normalized state. The Casimir operator for any
irreducible representation satisﬁes

K0|k, ni = (k + n)|k, ni,

(A.3)

K 2 = −K+K− + K0(K0 − 1) = k(k − 1).

(A.5)

16

The theory of unitary irreducible representations of the su(1, 1) Lie algebra
has been studied in several works [46] and it is based on equations (A.2)-
(A.5). Thus, a representation of su(1, 1) algebra is determined by the number
k. For the purpose of the present work we will restrict to the discrete series
only, for which k > 0.

The SU(1, 1) Perelomov coherent states |ζi are deﬁned as [24]

|ζi = D(ξ)|k, 0i,

(A.6)

where D(ξ) = exp(ξK+ − ξ∗K−) is the displacement operator and ξ is a
complex number. From the properties K†+ = K− and K†
= K+ it can be
−
shown that the displacement operator possesses the property

D†(ξ) = exp(ξ∗K− − ξK+) = D(−ξ),

(A.7)

and the so called normal form of the displacement operator is given by

D(ξ) = exp(ζK+) exp(ηK0) exp(−ζ∗K−),

(A.8)

where ξ = − 1
2τ )e−iϕ and η = −2 ln cosh|ξ| = ln(1−|ζ|2)
[47]. By using this normal form of the displacement operator and equations
(A.2)-(A.4), the Perelomov coherent states are found to be [24]

2 τ e−iϕ, ζ = − tanh( 1

|ζi = (1 − |ξ|2)k

∞Xs=0s Γ(n + 2k)

s!Γ(2k)

ξs|k, si.

6 Concluding remarks

We obtained the energy spectrum and the eigenfunctions for a relativistic
quantum particle in cosmic string spacetime in the presence of a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld and scalar potential. In our analysis, we supposed that the
magnetic ﬁeld was parallel to the string. The uncoupled second order radial
equations were obtained by using a transformation matrix which diagonalized
the 1/r term. It is shown that these two uncoupled equations are related by
the change γ → γ − 1.
In order to solve our problem we considered one of the two uncoupled
second order radial equations. We obtained the energy spectrum and the
eigenfunctions by using the theory of unitary representations in two diﬀerent

17

algebraic methods. In the ﬁrst one, we applied the Schr¨odinger factorization
and in the second one we used the tilting transformation.

The problem we have treated in the present paper has been previously
studied in references [13] and [14]. In these works, the uncoupled equations
for the spinor components were obtained by using a diﬀerent diagonaliza-
tion matrix. More speciﬁcally, in reference [13] the authors considered the
cases of relativistic spin-0 and spin- 1
2 particles, where the energy spectrum
and eigenfunctions are found in an analytical way. On the other hand, in
reference [14], the author solved this problem in an algebraic way by using
the Schr¨odinger factorization method. However, the parameters used in this
factorization are diﬀerent to those we used in the present work.

From the Sturmian basis of the su(1, 1) Lie algebra we constructed the
Perelomov coherent states for each radial component. The complete rela-
tivistic coherent states for a relativistic quantum particle in cosmic string
spacetime in the presence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld and scalar potential is
obtained by using the transformation matrix previously introduced in Section
2.
