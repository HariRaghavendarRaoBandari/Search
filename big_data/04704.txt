Motivated by the early stages of clouds and other systems in which droplets grow
and shrink in a turbulence-driven supersaturation ﬁeld, we investigate the problem of
turbulent condensation using direct numerical simulations. The turbulent ﬂuctuations of
the supersaturation ﬁeld oﬀer diﬀerent conditions for the growth of droplets which evolve
in time due to turbulent transport and mixing. Based on that, we propose a Lagrangian
stochastic model for condensation and evaporation of small droplets in turbulent ﬂows.
It consists of a set of stochastic integro-diﬀerential equations for the joint evolution of
the squared radius and the supersaturation along the droplet trajectories. The model has
two parameters ﬁxed by the total amount of water and the thermodynamic properties,
as well as the Lagrangian integral timescale of the turbulent supersaturation. The
model reproduces very well the droplet size distributions obtained from direct numerical
simulations and their time evolution. A noticeable result is that, after a stage where the
squared radius simply diﬀuses, the system converges exponentially fast to a statistical
steady state independent of the initial conditions. The main mechanism involved in this
convergence is a loss of memory induced by a signiﬁcant number of droplets undergoing a
complete evaporation before growing again. The statistical steady state is characterised
by an exponential tail in the droplet mass distribution. These results reconcile those of
earlier numerical studies, once these various regimes are considered. In the context of
clouds the results could help to explain the observed rapid precipitation formation as
in the steady state the probability for heavy droplets is much higher than expected by
traditional condensational growth models.

1. Introduction

There are many systems where it is needed to quantify the rate at which droplets shrink
and grow in a turbulent environment. This is for instance important when designing
turbines and air conditioning devices avoiding the formation of drops, or when studying
the evaporation behaviour of fuel directly injected into combustion chambers (Reveillon
& Demoulin 2007). In natural contexts warm clouds, i.e. ice-free clouds, are the prime
example. They are responsible for 30% of precipitation worldwide and have a huge impact
on the global temperature balance due to radiative transfer (Grabowski & Wang 2013).
Because of the associated uncertainties for weather forecasting and climate modeling, the
cloud microphysics were identiﬁed as one of the most urgent scientiﬁc problems in 1996
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Due to this importance much research
has been devoted to droplet growth in clouds (see the reviews by Shaw 2003; Devenish
et al. 2012; Grabowski & Wang 2013). Nevertheless, as highlighted in the following, the
detailed physics seems poorly understood as most in-situ cloud measurements are still
diﬃcult to explain theoretically.

The radius change by vapor diﬀusion of an isolated droplet of radius R can be written

where s is the supersaturation ﬁeld at the droplet position and the coeﬃcient A3 relates
to thermodynamical and diﬀusive properties and weakly depends on temperature and
pressure. From Eq. (1.1) it can be seen that for the same supersaturation the radius
of a small droplet grows faster than that of a larger one (the rate is indeed inversely
proportional to the radius). The growth by pure condensation up to raindrop size would
hence be too long compared to the timescales observed in nature. Coalescences between
droplets are thus needed but the speed of this process will strongly depend on the droplet
sizes obtained from condensation. Indeed, droplets of similar sizes are not very likely to
collide and thus a broad size distribution facilitates coalescences. For instance, a large
droplet might decouple from the airﬂow (by inertia or gravity) and can then collect nearby
smaller droplets. The triggering of such a runaway growth clearly depends on how broad is
the initial size spectrum. The broadening due to condensation is still poorly understood.
As larger droplets grow slower, one could expect that droplet size spectra get narrower
over time. However, measurements show the opposite trend (Pruppacher & Klett 1997;
Brenguier & Chaumat 2001), the droplet size spectra in clouds are broader than expected
from these simple arguments. This discrepancy is a long-standing puzzle and need to be
explained in order to bridge the size gap between the condensation and collision growths
(Devenish et al. 2012; Grabowski & Wang 2013). One of the key questions is the inﬂuence
of ﬂuctuations induced by turbulent mixing.

The eﬀect of turbulence on collision probabilities has been largely studied. After the
seminal work of Saﬀman & Turner (1956), a large number of theoretical (e.g., Falkovich
et al. 2002; Chun et al. 2005; Bec et al. 2005; Wilkinson et al. 2006), numerical (e.g.,
Squires & Eaton 1991; Reade & Collins 2000; Wang et al. 2008), and experimental (e.g.,
Aliseda et al. 2002; Bewley et al. 2013) studies have been conducted on this question. To
summarize without going into details: Very interesting coupling eﬀects between gravity,
droplet inertia, and turbulence, which make the collision process more eﬃcient, have
been identiﬁed. However, under typical turbulent conditions in clouds, the inertia of
droplets is too small to promote such enhancements of the collision probabilities as the
sole explanation for rapid precipitation formation.

Although it has attracted less attention in recent years, there has been also a continuous
research on condensational growth in clouds. Squires (1952) and Twomey (1959) were
the ﬁrst to model the interrelations between supersaturation, droplet number and sizes,
the updraft velocity and the associated variation in temperature. These so-called parcel
models are tracking the time evolution of an isolated small volume of cloud and are based
on mean-ﬁeld arguments. In this framework higher supersaturations are linked to higher
updraft velocities, so that the droplets with the largest growth rates have only a short
time to grow. As a result, the size distribution remains narrow and no broadening can
be found at a speciﬁc height (Bartlett & Jonas 1972).

Parcel models have two drawbacks implicitly originating from the underlying mean-
ﬁeld assumptions: Firstly, as noticed by Srivastava (1989), the local supersaturation
in the direct vicinity of a droplet can diﬀer from one droplet to another and from
the average supersaturation in a parcel. These diﬀerences in local supersaturation can
be due to variations in the amount of vapor consumption by droplets with diﬀerent
sizes — see Eq. (1.1) — as well as ﬂuctuations due to turbulence. The airﬂow Reynolds
number is generally high in clouds. It can thus be expected that the supersaturation
ﬁeld experiences non-negligible spatial and temporal ﬂuctuations that are responsible

3

for strong deviations from the average behaviour. Indeed, it was found using stochastic
modeling (Kulmala et al. 1997; Khvorostyanov & Curry 1999; McGraw & Liu 2006) that,
due to such ﬂuctuations, droplets can exists even if the global supersaturation is negative.
Hence, in such models the droplet size spectra are broader than those obtained by parcel
models, although the spectra are still less broad than those measured.

The second drawback of parcel models is the assumption that the tracked volume
does not mix over the whole evolution of the cloud. However, it is well known that
this is generally not true in turbulent ﬂows. For example, inertialess droplets (tracers)
separate explosively following Richardson diﬀusion, leading to a strong mixing between
various cloud volumes. Based on this picture Lasher-Trapp et al. (2005) and Sidin et al.
(2009) used large-eddy simulations and kinematic simulations in which they backtrace
all droplets that are in a speciﬁc volume at a ﬁnal time. As they come from very diﬀerent
locations in the cloud, a broad droplet size distribution is observed in the ﬁnal volume.
However, such a two-step approach is not well suited to account for the mutual inﬂuence
and competition between droplets that were close to each other in the past.

One way to overcome the issues of the parcel model is to perform direct numerical
simulations (DNS) for the joint evolutions of the ﬂuid velocity, temperature, and water
vapor, without introducing any ad-hoc modelling. This approach naturally accounts for
the above-mentioned points, the spatial and temporal ﬂuctuations in the supersaturation
and the turbulent transport and mixing. However, such simulations are computationally
very demanding and became thus feasible only rather recently. Vaillancourt et al. (2002)
were the ﬁrst to perform DNS of the turbulent ﬁelds coupled with a Lagrangian droplet
model. They ﬁnd only a very little increase in the broadening of the droplet size spectra,
compared to simulations without turbulence (Vaillancourt et al. 2001) and explain this
by the decorrelating eﬀect of turbulence between the droplet size and the supersaturation
in its vicinity.

Celani et al. (2005) have performed two-dimensional DNS in order to increase the
domain size and the range of turbulent eddies. They ﬁnd the opposite trend, namely a
very broad droplet size spectrum, but which might originate from neglecting the inﬂuence
of the droplets on the supersaturation ﬁeld. Later they contrast their results incorporating
more realistic physical treatments. In Celani et al. (2008), they implement a detailed
droplet activation scheme and obtain that the droplet size spectra are still very broad,
independently of the activation process. In Celani et al. (2007) and Celani et al. (2009),
they account for the back reaction of droplets on the supersaturation ﬁeld and observe a
negative mean supersaturation and a reduction of the spectral broadening that eventually
becomes stationary. Nevertheless, the spectra they measure are still very broad.

Paoli & Shariﬀ (2009) have performed three-dimensional DNS of turbulent conden-
sation with a large-scale forcing acting not only on the ﬂuid velocity but also on the
temperature and vapor ﬁelds. However, they do not speciﬁcally focus on estimating
spectral broadening but rather on developing a stochastic model intended to be used
in large-eddy or Reynolds-averaged simulations. Lanotte et al. (2009) ﬁnd in 3D DNS
that the droplet surface area has a distribution very close to a Gaussian and that the
broadening is rather small, in agreement with the ﬁndings of Vaillancourt et al. (2002).
However this broadening, measured for instance by the standard deviation of the droplet
surface area, increases with both time and Reynolds number. By dimensional arguments,
they extrapolate this behaviour to the large Reynolds numbers of clouds and predict a
signiﬁcant broadening. Very recently, Sardina et al. (2015) repeated the investigations of
Lanotte et al. (2009) with longer simulation times and higher resolutions. They found
that the standard deviation of the droplet surface area increases proportionally to the
square root of time. Additionally, they make use of the stochastic model of Paoli & Shariﬀ

4

C. Siewert, J. Bec and G. Krstulovic

(2009) to obtain that the constant factor in this behaviour is proportional to the Reynolds
number. This leads them to predict for realistic clouds a spectral broadening occurring
on time scales of the order of twenty minutes, in agreement with in-situ measurements.
Such an approach is particularly promising for designing realistic models for droplet
condensation in turbulent ﬂows. However, the various contradicting results of DNS
described above still lack a clear understanding. They show either too much broadening
compared to measurements or too few broadening when they are not extrapolated to
realistic cloud Reynolds numbers. Questions remain on the origins of these diﬀerences:
Are they due to dissimilarities in settings or governing equations? Does the problem lack
of universality and depend on dimensionality, initial conditions, and activation processes?
The aim of this paper is to reevaluate the problem of turbulent condensational growth
in a general manner and ask, from a ﬂuid dynamicist viewpoint, what are the eﬀects of
supersaturation ﬂuctuations and of the turbulent transport of droplets. We thus consider
simpliﬁed settings for which we perform three-dimensional direct numerical simulations.
Droplets are passively transported by a homogeneous, isotropic (periodic) turbulent ﬂow.
The variations in temperature and vapor concentration are modeled in terms of a single
scalar ﬁeld, the supersaturation, which is passively advected by the ﬂow and whose
ﬂuctuations are triggered by an additive random forcing. The droplets can completely
evaporate, without disappearing, and grow again if they reach a positive-supersaturation
region. Within such settings, the turbulent phase change is described by two relevant
timescales: the droplet growth rate and the response time of the supersaturation ﬁeld
upon condensation or evaporation. Depending whether these characteristic times are
greater or smaller than turbulent timescales and the observation time, one expects
diﬀerent regimes, as conﬁrmed by our numerics. We then introduce a stochastic integro-
diﬀerential Lagrangian model, which, at variance with that of Paoli & Shariﬀ (2009),
imposes the global mass conservation of liquid and vapor and utilizes the Lagrangian
correlation time. This model is shown to reproduce well the results of DNS. In addition,
we ﬁnd that the condensation process converges to a statistically steady state, so that
the droplet size distribution and the ﬂuctuations of the supersaturation ﬁeld become
independent of time and initial conditions. This convergence is preceded by a Brownian
stage during which the droplet surface area just diﬀuses. The convergence to the steady
state occurs once a signiﬁcant fraction of droplets has completely evaporated at least
once. For both the model and the DNS, the stationary probability distribution function
(PDF) of droplet masses is shown to have an exponential tail that we characterise as a
function of the relevant parameters.
The paper is organised as follows. In §2 we ﬁrst describe our settings and numerical
simulations and give qualitative insights on expected regimes. We then present in §3 a
stochastic Lagrangian model and compare it to numerics. In §4 we focus on the statistical
steady state reached at long times, while in §5 we investigate the transient convergence.
We ﬁnally come back in §6 to the problem of condensational growth in turbulent clouds
and draw concluding remarks in §7.

2. Settings

To concentrate on the inﬂuence of turbulence we choose idealized settings. This enables
us to make analytical predictions but, of course, at the risk of missing important physical
phenomena that might be important for applications. That is why we state precisely in
the following under which conditions the equations are valid.

We start with restating Eq. (1.1) in terms of the droplet surface area growth:

(2.1)

Here it is assumed that the timescale associated to the establishment of vapor diﬀusion
is faster than the external timescales especially the smallest scales of turbulence (see,
e.g., Pruppacher & Klett 1997, for a detailed derivation). This is a valid approximation
in clouds (Vaillancourt et al. 2001) but might not be in highly turbulent environments
occurring in technical applications. Additionally, it is assumed that the droplet volume
loading is small enough to ensure no overlap between the diﬀusion regions of diﬀerent
droplets. Again, this assumption of isolated droplet growth is not general but it is valid
for clouds (Vaillancourt et al. 2001). Furthermore, the coeﬃcient A3 is assumed to be
constant, i.e. the small temperature dependence is neglected. Finally, curvature and
salinity eﬀects relevant for the activation and aﬀecting the growth of very small droplets
are neglected (Celani et al. 2008). Instead, we assume that a completely evaporated
droplet is simply reactivated if it is located in a region with positive supersaturation
playing the role of a condensation nuclei that stays in the system. We show in §4 that
the speciﬁc type of boundary condition imposed at R = 0 is not important for the
large-value tail of the droplet size distribution, i.e. faraway from the zero-size boundary.
The growing and shrinking droplets are transported by a turbulent gas velocity u

according to the Stokes drag law

(2.2)

where x and v are the particle position and velocity, τd = 2ρdR2/(9ρν) is the droplet
response time, ρd its mass density, and ρ and ν are the gas mass density and kinematic
viscosity, respectively. The Stokes drag approximation is valid for very small and heavy
liquid droplets. The droplet radius R has to be smaller than the smallest scale of
turbulence, the Kolmogorov dissipative scale η = ν3/4/ε1/4, where ε is the mean kinetic
energy dissipation rate of the turbulent gasﬂow. Although the liquid to gas density ratio
ρd/ρ is typically of the order of 1000, the droplet size and therewith its mass are typically
small enough for gravitational acceleration to be neglected. A posteriori we know that
in our parameter range the droplet motion is practically identical to tracer motion as
the droplet response time stays negligibly small. Furthermore, for the smallest particles
Brownian motion might become important.

The gas velocity u evolves according to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation

∂u
∂t

+ u·∇u = − 1
ρ

∇p + ν∇2u + Φu , ∇· u = 0 ,

(2.3)

where p is the pressure and Φu is a large-scale forcing. Therewith, as for the droplets, we
neglect temperature and gravity eﬀects, including buoyancy. This approximation is not
fully justiﬁed for natural clouds, as latent heat release upon condensation is generally
important. Natural convection is actually the main source for updrafts and kinetic
energy input. Additionally, the cloud edges are the location of a strong mixing with
subsaturated cloud-free air. This eﬀect, called entrainment or detrainment, together with
buoyancy, is generally responsible for strong large-scale inhomogeneties and anisotropies.
Here, we actually assume that the turbulent ﬂow is homogeneous and isotropic and
is maintained in a developed turbulent state by the large-scale forcing Φu. This setup
might be representative for a portion of the cloud core region where inhomogeneities are

C. Siewert, J. Bec and G. Krstulovic

negligible. As a matter of fact, we will show in §6 that some of our results are similar
to those of Celani et al. (2007) who accounted for the temperature ﬁeld and buoyancy
eﬀects.

Since thermal eﬀects are neglected, it is not necessary to treat the temperature and
vapor ﬁelds separately. Instead the supersaturation s can be modeled as passive scalar
coupled to the Lagrangian particles

(2.4)

where κ is the molecular diﬀusivity of the vapor inside the gas. The second term on
the right-hand side accounts for the local change in supersaturation due to the presence
of N droplets. There, xi denotes the position of the ith droplet and the coeﬃcient A2
accounts for both the change in vapor mass and temperature due to the condensation or
evaporation. We assume again that the temperature dependence of A2 is negligible. Also
the supersaturation ﬁeld is again forced by a large-scale forcing Φs. This is motivated
by our idea to concentrate on the inﬂuence of turbulent mixing. Most statistical studies
on the advection of passive scalars by turbulent ﬂow are making use of this kind of
forcing. The properties of the supersaturation ﬁeld without droplets, which is then a
passive scalar, are thus well known. Even if this has been recently questioned by Gotoh
& Watanabe (2015), one expects such properties to not depend on the speciﬁc form of
forcing and to display some universality. For instance, coherent structures are present at
all length scales, separated by regions where the ﬁeld undergoes signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations,
the so-called fronts associated with very sharp gradients (Celani et al. 2001). In contrast
to assuming a mean vertical temperature gradient, the choice we have made for the forcing
ensures the statistical homogeneity and isotropy of the scalar ﬁeld s, and hence of the
droplet sizes. In addition, this forcing inputs only variance but no mean supersaturation

((cid:82) Φsdx3 = 0 ). The system (2.1)-(2.4) conserves the global mass of liquid and vapor

2.2. Qualitative Predictions

To identify which parameters are relevant, we analyse here the dimensionless equations.
The turbulent ﬂuctuations of supersaturation along droplet trajectories are essentially
correlated over the large scales, because to leading order, droplets are Lagrangian objects.
We thus decide to use as a reference length, the large scale L = u3
rms/ε, where urms is
the root-mean-square velocity, and as a reference time the large eddy turnover time
TL = L/urms. Applying this to the Navier-Stokes equations (2.3) leads to the Reynolds
number

Re =

τν
TL

=

L2/ν
TL

,

(2.6)

which is the ratio of viscous mixing time scale to the turbulent advection time scale.
In principle we want the Reynolds number as large as possible in order to have a large
separation between the forcing and the dissipation scales. However, the computational
eﬀort increases with the resolution, such that most of our simulations will be conducted
at Re = 2100.

The droplet equation of motion (2.2) leads to introduce the large-scale Stokes number

St =

τd
TL

=

2ρd ¯R2

.

(2.7)

A priori the typical droplet size ¯R evolves with time, and so does the Stokes number.
We choose here and in the following to use the droplet mass averaged over the whole
population, namely ¯R = (cid:104)R3(cid:105)1/3. As the droplets are typically small, we expect the
Stokes number to be small, so that inertia eﬀects, such as clustering, are weak even on
the smallest scales.

The supersaturation equation (2.4) provides two timescale ratios: The Schmidt number

which is obtained from a spatial average over the volume V and depends on both the

The supersaturation diﬀusion-advection equation (2.4) is linear and hence the proper
choice for the reference value of s is not straightforward. We select its standard deviation
srms in the absence of droplets. From the droplet growth equation (2.1) a time scale
arises, which we call hereafter the condensation timescale

τc

¯R2

(2.10)

This condensation timescale did not receive much attention in recent DNS studies of
homogeneous condensation (Vaillancourt et al. 2002; Celani et al. 2005; Lanotte et al.
2009; Sardina et al. 2015). However it is known and used in the context of mixing at the
cloud edge. Based on the notation in reacting ﬂows a Damk¨ohler number is constructed
to compare the turbulent mixing timescale to the time for phase change (Devenish et al.
2012). In this sense, the dimensionless quantities deﬁned in Eqs. (2.9) and (2.10) can be
seen as inverse Damk¨ohler numbers. This raises the question about the relevant timescales
that characterise the system. From their DNS results, Kumar et al. (2012) concluded
that the Damk¨ohler number based on the supersaturation timescale is the relevant one.
However, Lehmann et al. (2009) argued that the timescale of the coupled system might
be very diﬀerent from both the condensation and supersaturation timescales.

We give here some preliminary hand-waving arguments on possible asymptotic be-
haviour of the system. Let us consider the supersaturation equation (2.4): If τs is very
large, the inﬂuence of the particle on the supersaturation ﬁeld is small, i.e. its evolution
is dominated by turbulent mixing characterised by the timescale TL. Conversely, if this
supersaturation timescale is very small, the condensation or evaporation of droplets
dominates the variations of s and the characteristic timescale for the supersaturation
evolution is τs. The supersaturation ﬁeld thus changes on a timescale given by the
minimum of TL and τs. Assume now that the condensation timescale τc is much larger
than the minimum of TL and τs, meaning that the droplet sizes change slowly compared
to the supersaturation ﬁeld. This was implicitly assumed in mean-ﬁeld parcel models and
corresponds to the homogeneous case (small Damk¨ohler number) in the context of chem-
ical reactions. In this case individual droplets experience a fast changing supersaturation,
which to leading order can be approximated as a random white noise. From Eq. (2.1),

one infers that their surface area R2 follows a Brownian motion. This implies that the
standard deviation of the droplets surface σR2 , which gives a measure of the spectral
t. Conversely, if we now consider that τc is much smaller than
the minimum of TL and τs, the droplet sizes change faster than the supersaturation value
along their trajectories. We are then in the inhomogeneous limit, where more complex
dynamics can be expected. Droplets experience a quasi constant supersaturation value for
a long time and change their sizes rapidly. This could lead to both very large droplets and
complete evaporation. We thus expect in this case a very broad droplet size spectrum.

2.3. Direct numerical simulations

We conduct a series of direct numerical simulations of the ﬂow and the supersaturation
ﬁeld with the pseudo-spectral code LaTu (Homann et al. 2007) for a cubic, periodic
domain. The various parameters are reported in Table 1. Most simulations are performed
at a resolution of 5123 collocation points, corresponding to a Taylor micro-scale Reynolds
number Rλ ≈ 180. The ratio between the largest and the smallest time scales is
TL/τη ≈ 50, indicating a suﬃcient scale separation. Additionally, selected simulations
are repeated at decreased (2563) and increased (10243) resolutions, corresponding to
Rλ ≈ 100 and Rλ ≈ 320, respectively, in order to test possible Reynolds number
dependence. We only consider cases where the Schmidt number is unity and the Eulerian
mean supersaturation is initially zero. The ﬁelds are evolved until a statistical steady
state is reached. Then ten millions equal-sized droplets are randomly released in the
domain with a large-scale Stokes number of St = 2.3× 10−5. These Lagrangian droplets,
together with their sizes, are subsequently integrated according to Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2)
using a tri-cubic interpolation of the gas velocity and of the supersaturation value at
the particle position. The back-reaction of the droplets onto the supersaturation ﬁeld in
Eq. (2.4) is performed by linear extrapolation to the nearest collocation points.

The parameter space explored in terms of the condensation and supersaturation time
scales τc and τs is shown in Fig. 1. Diﬀerent combinations are chosen in or close to the
turbulent inertial range in order to detect possible interferences or resonances between the
various physical processes. We choose the cases C3 and C4 as representative examples.
They feature the same value of the condensation timescale τc < TL, but C4 has a larger
value of the supersaturation timescale τs < TL, such that we expect to obtain for these
instances the two diﬀerent asymptotic regimes discussed in §2.2. Two-dimensional cuts

scalar. The inﬂuence of the droplets is practically unnoticeable, except globally as the
spatial average of s is negative. The case C3, where τs < τc < TL, is represented on the

s are strongly reduced at both positive and negative values. Large-scale structures still
exist, but intermediate-scale variations are smoothed out by the droplet-vapor exchange.
At ﬁne scales the inﬂuence of the individual droplets can be recognized. Their positions
are superimposed on the lower half of Fig. 2. There are very few completely evaporated
droplets, but no droplet that has doubled its surface area after 3.1 TL. For comparison,
in the case C4, there are large droplets and a huge portion of evaporated droplets can
be found in regions with a negative supersaturation.

3. Stochastic Model

To understand further the diﬀerent regimes discussed in §2.2, we develop here a
stochastic model which is giving a simple approximation for the global system (2.1)-
(2.4). This model is supposed to give predictions for the global evolution of the size
distribution, rather than a good approximation for the time evolution of single droplets. In
that sense, this model should be intended as a PDF model, rather than a pure Lagrangian
approximation. It is expected to reproduce well the one-point one-time joint statistics of
R and s but, in principle, cannot be used for multiple-point or multiple-time statistics.

3.1. Derivation

We are interested in the behaviour of the joint distribution of R2 and s at droplets
on large timescales. The large-scale Stokes number being small, we thus assume that
droplet inertia can be neglected. Following ideas borrowed from PDF modelling of tur-
bulent mixing (see Pope 2000), we assume that along droplet trajectories, the variations
of supersaturation due to diﬀusion and forcing can be approximated by a Langevin
(Ornstein–Uhlenbeck) process. The correlation time should then be the integral time
scale of the Lagrangian scalar autocorrelation TL,s and the drift the (time-dependent)
Eulerian average of the supersaturation ﬁeld (cid:104)s(cid:105)E. When taking into account the variation
of supersaturation due to condensation or evaporation of the droplet from Eq. (2.4), this
leads to model the evolution of s along droplets as

where ξ is the standard white noise. This evolution equation is of course supplemented
by Eq. (2.1) to account for the time variations of the droplet radius R. This modelling
involves the Eulerian average (cid:104)s(cid:105)E of the supersaturation ﬁeld which is not directly given
by a Lagrangian approach but can be inferred from the global mass conservation of liquid
and vapor. We indeed have from (2.5) combined with (2.9) and (2.10)

The Eulerian averaged supersaturation is thus a global quantity that depends on the full
distribution of R. In that sense the system is not closed at the level of a single droplet and
the associated Fokker–Planck equation is an integro-diﬀerential equation. Because of this,
our model diﬀers from that proposed by Paoli & Shariﬀ (2009). They have indeed used
the Lagrangian mean of s instead of the Eulerian one. Additionally, we want to emphasize
that the supersaturation along trajectories is correlated over times corresponding to the
Lagrangian integral timescale of the scalar TL,s. Table 1 shows in agreement with Yeung
(2001) that TL,s generally diﬀers from the large eddy turnover time TL used by Paoli &
Shariﬀ (2009) and the Lagrangian integral timescale of the velocity TL,u used by Sardina
et al. (2015).

To provide evidence that TL,s is the correct correlation time, we conduct DNS at

the dimensionless parameters τc/TL,s and τs/TL,s constant. As depicted in Table 1, these
parameters would diﬀer by 20 or 25 percent in this Reynolds number range if TL or TL,u
would have been used instead. Figure 3 shows the probability density function (PDF)
of the droplet surface area R2 for the three diﬀerent Reynolds numbers. The collapse of
the distribution conﬁrms the role of large-scale mixing and emphasizes the choice of TL,s
as a reference timescale. If there is a Reynolds number dependence at all it is only very
weak.

This is an unclosed hierarchy of equations and can only be solved if additional closure
assumptions are made. However, it is possible to understand qualitatively the system
dynamics. A typical trajectory in the phase space is shown in Fig. 4. Due to the noise
term the supersaturation tends to do Brownian excursions. For negative values of s
the droplet shrinks while for positive values the droplet grows. The drift term prevents
runaway excursions to s = ±∞. Note that the non-linear coupling term −ARs is
dominant for large droplets R2 (cid:29) 1/A2. Thereto the larger the droplet is, the faster
a positive s is reduced to zero, so that large droplets can growth only on very short
timescales. Conversely, an evaporating droplet is less and less eﬀective in pushing its
negative supersaturation back to zero and thus has longer and longer times to shrink.
Due to this bias it seems reasonable to assume that a droplet cannot grow inﬁnitely
large. In the opposite limit, when a droplet completely evaporates (touches R = 0), the
dynamics of s decouples from R and the droplet will start growing only once s becomes
positive, reinitializing the full process again. There is thus a loss of memory of the previous
growth history. Bounded excursions, together with the recurrent memory losses suggest
that, at long time, the system should reach a statistical stationary state independent of
its initial condition.

3.2. Comparison with DNS

We perform Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of the system (3.3) for the same parameters
as in the DNS cases C3 and C4 shown in Fig. 2. Thereto the parameters A (3.5) and
(cid:104)W(cid:105) (3.4) are calculated from the DNS initial conditions. Especially TL,s and srms are
measured from the initial supersaturation ﬁeld as the afterwards released droplets change

its properties. The parameters A and (cid:104)W(cid:105) both depend on srms, hence, the model is
sensitive to the value of srms. The MC simulations allow us to simulate the system for
much longer times than for the DNS.
The evolution of (cid:104)R2(cid:105) is shown in the left panel of Fig. 5. In the case C3 the mean
value of R2 for both the DNS and the model, ﬁrst stays relatively constant and then
even decreases. In contrast, for the case C4, the average of R2 increases substantially
before converging to a constant value. In this case, the model lags a little bit behind
the DNS. Additionally, the ﬁnal value seems to be a few percent higher, although this is
not unambiguous as the DNS value strongly ﬂuctuates. That is why we have represented
two diﬀerent realizations of the full DNS C4 in Fig. 5. Given the large amplitude of
the variations between these two runs and of the ﬂuctuations as a function of time, the
deviations from the model could be explainable by a lack of ensemble averaging. While the
number of droplets is the same for the DNS and the MC simulation, the supersaturation
in DNS is correlated on the large scales, whereas the noise terms are independent in the
model. Hence, the number of independent realizations is higher in the model. Ensemble
averaging of independent DNS realizations would be needed but is computationally too
expensive.

The right panel of Fig. 5 represents the coeﬃcient of variation of the droplet surface
R/(cid:104)R2(cid:105). In the case C4 it increases ﬁrst
area, namely the relative standard deviation σ2
rapidly and then converges, although more slowly than the mean value, to a value close to
one. The model values are slightly lower than the DNS. Nevertheless, for both the model
and the DNS, the coeﬃcient of variation is large, indicating a very broad distribution
close to the one given for instance by an exponential distribution. For the case C3, the
relative standard deviation starts much lower and for a decade of time, the predicted t1/2
power-law can be seen in the double-logarithmic plot. Hence, while the case C4 is already
in the steady state in Fig. 2, C3 is still in the Brownian motion regime, leading to the
very diﬀerent pictures. However, also in the case C3, the model eventually converges to
a constant value, i.e. a steady state is reached at very large times.

To conclude we want to emphasize two points: First, the MC simulations conﬁrm the
above reasoning that, at long times, the system converges to a steady state. Hence, the

hand-waving arguments of §2.2 actually describe two regimes of the transient system
behaviour. Second, the model predictions are representative of the actual dynamics. The
simple stochastic model is indeed able to reproduce some results of the DNS surprisingly
well. This is unexpected as the turbulence is only modeled trivially and no intermittency
or inertia eﬀects are taken into account. The short-time behaviour is perfectly reproduced,
while there are deviations for the steady state. However, these deviations are systematic
for all DNS runs reported in Fig. 1 that we have conducted. We will come back to this
issue in the next section.

4. The steady state

Here we characterise the steady state by analytical predictions based on the model,
compare these with the numerical results and show the dependence of the steady state
on the two model parameters.

4.1. Model-based analytical predictions

We can ﬁnd from the equations of the moments (3.6) that in the steady state, the
Lagrangian and Eulerian mean of the supersaturation coincide (cid:104)s(cid:105) = (cid:104)s(cid:105)E as all time
derivatives are zero and thus the mixed moments (cid:104)sRx(cid:105) all vanish. The latter can only
be fulﬁlled if the probability density function of the supersaturation s conditioned on any
R > 0 is symmetric around zero. Due to the convergence of the mean droplet mass (cid:104)R3(cid:105)
and of the mean Eulerian supersaturation (cid:104)s(cid:105)E, the system (3.3) is no longer a stochastic
integro-diﬀerential equation as it does not involve anymore integrals. Hence, it can be
described by its associated stationary Fokker–Planck equation. To reﬂect the piecewise
deﬁnition of the stochastic model (3.3), we split the joint probability density p into an
atomic contribution m for evaporated droplets and a smooth part ˜p for active droplets

The stationary Fokker-Planck equation for the active droplets ˜p(cid:0)s, R2, t → ∞(cid:1) can then

(4.2)

Despite the simpliﬁcations in the steady state, ﬁnding a general solution is not straight-
forward because of the non-linear coupling term (1 + AR) s. Nevertheless, we can predict
the shape of the tail of the distribution p(R2) of the droplet surface area. Interpreting
the surface area R2 as position and the supersaturation s as velocity, equation (4.2)
is similar to the Fokker–Planck equation associated to Brownian particles subject to a
position-dependent drag. In the large-drag limit the velocity is a fast variable and can
be eliminated. Following Sancho et al. (1982), an expansion of the non-linear drag term
yields to leading order

(4.3)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

This solution is only valid when the term (1 + AR) is dominant, i.e. for large droplets
with R2 (cid:29) 1/A2 (see Fig. 4). One could think of ﬁnding another solution for the opposite
asymptotic R2 (cid:28) 1/A2 and then match the two limiting solutions similarly to the
approach in boundary layer theory. However, due to the ﬁnite probability of having
completely evaporated droplets, see Eq. (4.1), and the complicated boundary conditions
at R = 0, this is a very challenging task. Still, the large-droplet solution (4.3) has global

15

consequences: To have an integrable distribution of large droplets the mean Eulerian
supersaturation (cid:104)s(cid:105)E has to be negative. As seen above, s conditioned on R > 0 has to
be symmetric around zero, such that the mean value of s in the presence of droplets is
zero. Hence, only s conditioned on R = 0 contribute to the negative (cid:104)s(cid:105)E. Therefore, it
follows that the presence of completely evaporated droplets is a prerequisite for reaching
the steady state.

4.2. Comparison with numerical results

In the following we show that the theoretical predictions on the PDFs of R2 and
s not only apply to the model but also to the DNS. In Fig. 6 the predictions, the
MC simulations, and the DNS are contrasted by the means of the PDF of R2 and the
conditioned PDFs of s. For the case C4 we know from Fig. 5 that the model predicts a
slightly higher (cid:104)R2(cid:105) than the DNS. The PDF of R2 obtained from the model shows a
higher probability for intermediate-size droplets, which leads to this higher mean value.
For R2 (cid:29) 1/A2 the MC simulation ﬁt the tail prediction (4.3). The tail of the PDF
of the DNS is parallel to this prediction, i.e. the shapes match, up to a multiplicative
constant. The PDF of the supersaturation s is shown conditioned on the droplet size.
For evaporated droplets (R2 = 0) the PDF of s has only negative values. For ﬁnite-size
droplets the PDFs are centered at zero and nearly symmetric with practically constant
variances, independently of the value of R2 on which the PDF is conditioned. The model
ﬁts well the supersaturation PDFs of the DNS though some small deviations can be
observed in the negative-s tail.

The trends discussed in the case C4 are representative for all DNS runs that we
have conducted and are reported in Fig. 1. To corroborate this, we also show the data
corresponding to the case C6, which features smaller τc and τs, i.e. a larger A. The
PDF of R2 obtained with the model coincides with the prediction at large droplet sizes.
Intermediate R’s are less probable in the DNS but the shape of the tail ﬁts. The PDFs
of s are well reproduced. While the PDF of s for evaporated droplets looks very similar
to that for the case C4, the active droplets damp the supersaturation more strongly due
to the larger coupling parameter A. Because of a smaller variance of s the droplets are
smaller in the case C6 than in the case C4.

4.3. Characterisation by the model parameters

In the steady state the system (3.3) depends only on the two model parameters,
namely the coupling parameter A deﬁned in (3.5) and the total mass (cid:104)W(cid:105) associated
to the conservation of liquid and vapor (3.4). In Fig. 7 the steady state is characterised
by the mean drop surface area, its relative standard deviation, and the mean Eulerian
supersaturation which are represented as a function of A for various values of (cid:104)W(cid:105).
The mean drop surface area (cid:104)R2(cid:105)|R>0 shows approximately a power-law behaviour
∝ A−2/3. This can be explained by the conservation of mass (3.4). For large A the third
moment of R corresponding to the mean drop mass has to decrease correspondingly. This
argument also explains why (cid:104)R2(cid:105)|R>0 increases with (cid:104)W(cid:105). We would like to emphasize
the fact that mean-ﬁeld arguments predict no drop growth for an initially vanishing
average supersaturation. In contrast, due to the supersaturation ﬂuctuations (cid:104)R2(cid:105)|R>0
always converges to a positive, non-zero value even for zero total mass in the system.
Following the same scaling arguments (cid:104)R4(cid:105) is proportional to A−4/3, such that, to
leading order, σR2 /(cid:104)R2(cid:105)|R>0 is expected to be constant. However, one ﬁnds that the size
broadening slightly decreases with A. This can be explained by the tail prediction, since
(cid:104)R4(cid:105) depends strongly on the large droplets. For large A, the droplet size distribution

indicated as a thin solid black line. Right side: Probability density function of s conditioned on

has a sub-exponential tail given by (4.3). Consistently, the relative standard deviation
features values smaller than 1, which decrease slowly with A. For A going to zero,
an exponential distribution would be expected from Eq. (4.3), similarly to the case of
Brownian motion with reﬂection. However, the shape prediction is only valid for (1 + AR)
large and hence the moments become dominated by the unknown small-drag distribution.
The mean drop size increases with (cid:104)W(cid:105), so that the tail prediction is valid for a larger
portion of the PDF of R2 and σR2/(cid:104)R2(cid:105) becomes smaller.
A negative mean Eulerian supersaturation (cid:104)s(cid:105)E is a requirement for a steady state (see
§4.1). Note that

(cid:90)

(cid:104)s(cid:105)E = (cid:104)s(cid:105) = (cid:104)s|R = 0(cid:105)p (R = 0) +

(4.4)

Since the PDF of s conditioned on R = 0 seems to be independent of both A and
(cid:104)W(cid:105) (see Fig. 6), the value of (cid:104)s(cid:105)E is directly proportional to the number of evaporated
drops. For a small coupling parameter A, the tendency for droplets to be pushed towards
R2 = 0 is low, so that most of them are active. As A increases, the steady-state fraction
of evaporated droplets increases. This leads to more negative contributions to (cid:104)s(cid:105)E. The

mean size (cid:104)R2(cid:105) increases with (cid:104)W(cid:105), and therefore the distance to the zero-size boundary
becomes larger. Hence, for larger (cid:104)W(cid:105), the probability for evaporated droplets is smaller
and (cid:104)s(cid:105)E is larger, closer to zero.

The DNS statistics are also shown in Fig. 7. These values are less certain, since, as
visible in Fig. 5, they ﬂuctuate more strongly and the forth-order moment of R might not
be fully converged to its steady-state value at the end of the simulation time of 20 TL,s.
As expected from Fig. 5, the DNS cases show lower mean values and higher relative
standard deviations. Nevertheless, their scalings are consistent with the model results.

Finally, to show that the shape of the PDF of R2 at large droplet sizes does not depend
on the treatment of those with a size close to zero, the model is modiﬁed to activate
droplets according to a parameterisation given by the K¨ohler-Kelvin theory (see, e.g.,
Seifert & Beheng 2006). In this parameterisation the activation probability depends as
a power-law on s. Thereby the time a droplet spends at R = 0 until it is reactivated is
increased. Hence, the number of evaporated drops in the steady state increases. However,
as it can be seen in Fig. 8, the dynamics of large drops faraway from the boundary is
practically unaﬀected. This is consistent with the ﬁndings of Celani et al. (2008) (see §1).

5. Transients

Depending on the physical situation, the timescales to reach the steady state can be
too long compared to timescale of interest such that the transient behaviour is of interest.
As anticipated in the context of Fig. 5, the time evolution of the system (3.3) can be
diﬀerentiated into two stages, a short-time and a long-time behaviour. In the following
these two transients are described.

5.1. Short-time behaviour

monodisperse drop spectrum δ(cid:0)R − ¯R0

At short times the evolution of the system still depends on the initial conditions for s
and R. We exemplarily explain the short-time behaviour of Eqs. (3.3) by concentrating

These predictions are compared in Fig. 9 to the DNS results for the case C1. The initial
time evolution of the relative standard deviation matches very well. This demonstrates
that the droplets feel the supersaturation along their trajectory as if it was white noise
because α (cid:28) τc/TL,s (see §2.2). The resulting Brownian motion for the drop surface area
leads to a Gaussian distribution with a variance increasing linearly with time. The time-
dependent DNS distributions can be perfectly collapsed to a standard normal distribution
using the predicted values. When time increases, the assumptions used to derive Eqs. (5.1)
are violated, e.g., (cid:104)R3(cid:105) increases slightly with increasing σR2. Nevertheless, the prediction
for σR2 /(cid:104)R2(cid:105) stays close to the DNS values.

The system behaviour changes drastically when the drop size distribution becomes so
wide that some droplets start to completely evaporate. Thereby, they lose their memory
of their past history and they thus become independent of their initial condition. This
is apparent in Fig. 10 where the time evolutions of two MC simulations with diﬀerent
initial conditions but the same parameters A and (cid:104)W(cid:105) are compared. While the time
evolutions depend on the initial conditions at short times and is thus very diﬀerent, they
converge towards each other and coincide at long times.

The time at which the diﬀusive short-time behaviour ends and a transition to the long-
time behaviour starts is the time at which complete evaporation becomes signiﬁcant. This
evaporation time tevap can be estimated as the time where 2σR2 ∼ (cid:104)R2(cid:105). From (5.1b) one

Note that a harmonic mean of TL,s and τs appears — see Eq. (5.2). This is very close
to the initial phenomenological reasoning τc > min (τs, TL) that was used to distinguish
between the two regimes found in the DNS (see §2.2). Also Paoli & Shariﬀ (2009) could
collapse the time dependence of their DNS results by normalizing time with the harmonic
mean of TL and τs. As rule of thumb it can be stated that the short-time behaviour
containing no evaporated droplets is always present. However, when (cid:104)W(cid:105) is smaller than
one, it is too short to be identiﬁed (see Fig. 12).

5.2. Long-time behaviour

The long-time evolution of the system is independent of the initial conditions (see
Fig. 10). It can be expected that the system converges exponentially fast to the steady
state with a rate given by the largest eigenvalue of the Fokker-Planck equation associated
to the stochastic dynamics (3.3). This is conﬁrmed in the inset of Fig. 10. The exponential
convergence time Tconv can be measured and is plotted in Fig. 11. The curves are very
similar to the steady state values of (cid:104)s(cid:105)E and the behaviour can be explained by the same
arguments. The larger is the parameter A, the stronger is the bias due to the coupling
term, i.e. the waiting time to be evaporated shortens. For large A the convergence time

seems to saturate to approximately 2.75 TL,s for (cid:104)W(cid:105) = 0. At larger masses (cid:104)W(cid:105), the
convergence to the steady state is slower. Since the mean droplet size is larger (see Fig. 7),
the time needed for droplets to completely evaporate increases. In DNS the convergence
to the steady state is faster than in the model. This was already visible from Fig. 5,
albeit it can also be seen that the measurements are less certain and the ﬂuctuations of
the moments of R are stronger. Nevertheless, the trends with respect to A and (cid:104)W(cid:105) seem
to be consistent with the behaviour obtained from the model.

6. Applicability to clouds

With the knowledge gained from studying the general behaviour of the stochastic
model (3.3) we want to turn back to apply our work to cloud formation (see §1). Firstly,
it is worth stressing that we can reconcile the results of the DNS studies in literature by
transferring our results to the other studies. Depending on the choice of the parameters,
the diﬀerent regimes in the evolution of the system can be found. For initially large drops,
the time until the ﬁrst evaporation is long (see (5.3)) such that the Brownian motion
behaviour described in §5.1 is observed (see, e.g., Lanotte et al. 2009; Sardina et al. 2015).
For smaller τc/TL complete evaporation occurs faster, so that the long-time behaviour
characterised in §5.2 is observed (as for instance in Celani et al. 2005, 2008). Eventually,
the steady state is reached (§4.1); the evolution of the droplet spectrum stops due to the
fact that the average of s conditioned on R > 0 converges to zero (Celani et al. 2009).

A question remains regarding the parameter values that are representative for clouds,
as they deﬁne in which regime the turbulent condensation in clouds is. Our main diﬃculty
to answer this question is, besides the huge variability of clouds, the accurate estimation of
the properties of the supersaturation ﬁeld. Measuring the supersaturation in the presence
of drops is diﬃcult (Ditas et al. 2012). Nevertheless, there seems to be a consensus in the
literature that the mean supersaturation is not exceeding 1% (Pruppacher & Klett 1997;
Grabowski & Wang 2013) with a typical value being 0.1% (Lanotte et al. 2009; Devenish
et al. 2012). However, the ﬂuctuation intensity is less well known. The measurements
of Ditas et al. (2012) indicate that the standard deviation of s in the presence of drops

points in terms of the coupling parameter A (eq. 3.5) and the mass (cid:104)W(cid:105) (eq. 3.4). The thick
dash-dotted line indicates equation (5.4) separating the region above with green diamonds, for
which initially the Brownian motion short time behaviour is observed (§5.1), from the region
below with blue circles, for which the system directly converges exponentially to the steady state

is comparable to its mean value. Following the dimensional arguments of Lanotte et al.
(2009) the supersaturation ﬂuctuations in the absence of drops can be estimated as
srms = A1wrmsTL. Using 3.6 × 10−4 m−1 (cid:54) A1 (cid:54) 11 × 10−4 m−1 (Grabowski & Wang
2013), wrms = 1 m/s (Grabowski & Wang 2013), A2 = 350 m3/kg (Lanotte et al. 2009),
A3 = 50 µm2/s (Lanotte et al. 2009), 50 cm−3 (cid:54) N/V (cid:54) 1000 cm−3 (Grabowski &
Wang 2013), and 15 s (cid:54) TL (cid:54) 235 s (Lasher-Trapp et al. 2005) the parameters A and
(cid:104)W(cid:105) can be estimated. In Fig. 12 the cloud estimates are shown together with the DNS
parameters and the curve separating the two transient behaviours. As the drop volume
loading and drop sizes upon activation are very small (∼ 1 µm, see Grabowski & Wang
2013) the drops barely contribute to the initial mass (cid:104)W(cid:105). Hence, if the above estimations
are valid, the results of this study would be very important for cloud microphysics. For
most clouds, the Brownian motion short-time transient (§5.1) would not be visible but
the drop size distribution would be directly converging to the steady state (§5.2). The
ratio of the convergence to the integral time scale is the highest for the lowest value of
the coupling parameter A and the highest value of the mass (cid:104)W(cid:105) (Tconv/TL,s ∼ 30, see
Fig. 11). However, since low values of A and high values of (cid:104)W(cid:105) are associated with short
TL,s, the convergence timescale to the steady state actually varies not that much despite
the huge A-(cid:104)W(cid:105) parameter space spanned by clouds. The convergence to the steady
state would occur on timescales 700 s (cid:62) Tconv (cid:62) 400 s or even less considering that the
DNS converges faster than the model (see Fig. 11). Then, the exponential tail in the
drop mass (see (4.3)) is an attractive result as the high probability for the appearance of

10−210010210410−410−310−210−1100101102C2C4C7C3C6C1C5C9C8A<W>23

heavy drops would trigger a transition to the run-away growth induced by coalescences
(see §1).

Certainly, the direct applicability to clouds has to be treated with caution as at the
cloud scale, the height dependence of the temperature and the mixing with dry air at
the cloud edges are not negligible (see §2.1). However, there is no obvious reason why
the model (Eqs. 3.3) should not be applied to the mixing problem as it is based on the
same governing equations. DNS show even similar trends for the PDF of R2 (ﬁg 3. of
Kumar et al. 2012): The tail has a shape in between a Gaussian and an exponential. The
temperature decrease with height can be easily incorporated by prescribing a height or
respectively time dependence for the mass (cid:104)W(cid:105) (Eq. 3.4). A source of supersaturation
would allow for even larger drops and would possibly remove the presence of cloud free
areas as occurring for case C4 in Fig. 2 and Celani et al. (in Fig. 1 of 2005) (see criticism
in Grabowski & Wang 2013). So we encourage cloud physicists to apply the stochastic
model Eqs. (3.3) to realistic cloud simulations.

7. Concluding remarks

In this study we showed that the problem of turbulent condensation can be modeled
and understood by a simple stochastic model. This model reproduces results from DNS
in the case when droplets are very small. A strong droplet inertia is certainly questioning
the validity of such modeling. We have indeed assumed that the ﬂuctuations of the
supersaturation ﬁeld along droplets follows a rather simple dynamics close to diﬀusion.
However, it is know that particles with signiﬁcant inertia tend to cluster in the fronts of an
advected scalar (Wetchagarun & Riley 2010; Bec et al. 2014) leading to very intermittent
Lagrangian statistics that cannot be reproduced by the model.

In the settings where droplet inertia can be neglected, such simple model can account
for most of the eﬀects of turbulence as the condensation/evaporation process is reversible
and only one-drop one-time statistics are relevant. However, for the understanding of the
spatial structure of the supersaturation ﬁeld and the transition to the collision-induced
growth, two-point statistics become important. Here, we expect non-trivial eﬀects since
turbulent transport can display anomalous scaling laws. By looking closely to Fig. 2
it can be seen that the droplet size and the local supersaturation value are correlated
for newly activated, small droplets while this correlation vanishes for larger droplets
whose size changes much slower. This means it overproportionally likely to ﬁnd equally
sized, small droplets on isosurfaces of speciﬁc supersaturation values, i.e. it seems that
a condensational clustering exists in absence of any droplet inertia.
