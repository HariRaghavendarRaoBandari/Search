The Drell-Yan (DY) process of dilepton pair production oﬀ nuclei is not aﬀected by ﬁnal state
interactions, energy loss or absorption. A detailed phenomenological study of this process is thus
convenient for investigation of the onset of initial-state eﬀects in proton-nucleus (pA) collisions.
In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the DY process in pA interactions at RHIC
and LHC energies in the color dipole framework. We analyse several eﬀects aﬀecting the nuclear
suppression, RpA < 1, of dilepton pairs, such as the saturation eﬀects, restrictions imposed by
energy conservation (the initial-state eﬀective energy loss) and the gluon shadowing, as a function
of the rapidity, invariant mass of dileptons and their transverse momenta pT . In this analysis, we
take into account besides the γ∗ also the Z 0 contribution to the production cross section, thus
extending the predictions to large dilepton invariant masses. Besides the nuclear attenuation of
produced dileptons at large energies and forward rapidities emerging due to the onset of shadowing
eﬀects, we predict a strong suppression at large pT , dilepton invariant masses and Feynman xF
caused by the Initial State Interaction eﬀects in kinematic regions where no shadowing is expected.
The manifestations of nuclear eﬀects are investigated also in terms of the correlation function in
azimuthal angle between the dilepton pair and a forward pion ∆φ for diﬀerent energies, dilepton
rapidites and invariant dilepton masses. We predict that the characteristic double-peak structure of
the correlation function around ∆φ ≃ π arises for very forward pions and large-mass dilepton pairs.

INTRODUCTION

During the last two decades, a series of theoretical and experimental studies of particle production in heavy ion
collisions (HICs) at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadrons Collider (LHC) energies has been
performed. These results provided us with various sources of information on properties of the hot and dense matter
(Quark Gluon Plasma) formed in these collisions. Although several issues still remain open, those are mainly related
to a description of nuclear eﬀects related to the initial-state formation before it interacts with a nuclear target, as well
as to the parton propagation in a nuclear medium. In this context, the phenomenological studies of hard processes in
proton-nucleus (pA) collisions can provide us with an additional quantitative information about various nuclear eﬀects
expected also in HICs. This can help us to disentangle between the medium eﬀects of diﬀerent types and constrain
their relative magnitudes and contributions [1].

A key feature of the Drell-Yan (DY) process is the absence of ﬁnal state interactions and fragmentation associated
with an energy loss or absorption phenomena. For this reason, the DY process can be considered as a very clean
probe for the Initial State Interaction (ISI) eﬀects [2]. In practice, this process can be used as a convenient tool in
studies of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at high energies, in particular, the saturation eﬀects expected to

determine the initial conditions in hadronic collisions as well as the initial-state energy loss due to the projectile quark
propagation in the nuclear medium before it experiences a hard scattering.

In the present paper, we study the DY process on nuclear targets at high energies using the color dipole approach
[3–12], which is known to give as precise prediction for the DY cross section as the Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO)
collinear factorization framework and allows to include naturally the coherence eﬀects in nuclear collisions. Moreover,
the color dipole formalism provides a straightforward generalisation of the DY process description from the proton-
proton to proton-nucleus collisions and is thus suitable for studies of nuclear eﬀects directly accessing the impact
parameter dependence of nuclear shadowing and nuclear broadening – the critical information which is not available
in the parton model.

In contrast to the conventional parton model where the dilepton production process is typically viewed as the
parton annihilation in the center of mass (c.m.) frame, in the color dipole approach operating in the target rest frame
the same process looks as a bremsstrahlung of a γ∗/Z 0 boson oﬀ a projectile quark. In pA collisions assuming the
high energy limit, the projectile quark probes a dense gluonic ﬁeld in the target and the nuclear shadowing leads to
a nuclear modiﬁcation of the transverse momentum distribution of the DY production cross section. The onset of
shadowing eﬀects is controlled by the coherence length, which can be interpreted as the mean lifetime of γ∗/Z 0-quark
ﬂuctuations, and is given by

where Ml¯l is the dilepton invariant mass and pT its transverse momentum. Moreover, α is the fraction of the light-cone
momentum of the projectile quark carried out by the gauge boson. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, in the RHIC and
LHC kinematic regions, the coherence length exceeds the nuclear radius RA, lc & RA, which implies that the long
coherence length (LCL) limit can be safely used in practical calculations of the DY cross section in pA collisions.

Besides the quark shadowing eﬀects naturally accounted for in the dipole picture, one should also take into account
the nuclear eﬀects due to multiple rescattering of initial-state projectile partons (ISI eﬀects) in a medium before
a hard scattering. The latter are important close to the kinematic limits, e.g. at large Feynman xF → 1 and
xT = 2pT /√s → 1 (√s is the collision energy in c.m.
frame), due to restrictions imposed by energy conservation.
In the present paper, we take into account also non-linear QCD eﬀects, which are ampliﬁed in nuclear collisions and
related to multiple scatterings of the higher Fock states containing gluons in the dipole-target interactions. They
generate the gluon shadowing eﬀects eﬀective at small Bjorken x in the target and large rapidity values.

In our study, all the basic ingredients for the DY nuclear production cross section (such as the dipole cross section
parameterisations and Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs)) have been determined from other processes. Conse-
quently, our predictions are parameter-free and should be considered as an important test for the onset of distinct
nuclear eﬀects. Note that the nuclear DY process mediated by a virtual photon has been already studied within the
color dipole framework by several authors (see e.g. Refs. [7–9]). However, the results of this paper represent a further
step updating and improving the previous analyses in the literature providing new predictions for the transverse
momentum, dilepton invariant mass and rapidity distributions of the nuclear DY production cross section at RHIC
and LHC energies as well as in comparison to the most recent data. Besides, the eﬀects of quantum coherence at large
energies including the gluon shadowing as a leading-twist shadowing correction as well as an additional contribution

3

of the Z 0 boson and γ∗/Z 0 interference are incorporated. Moreover, the impact of the eﬀective initial state energy
loss eﬀects on the DY nuclear production cross section is studied for the ﬁrst time. We also investigate nuclear
eﬀects providing a detailed analysis of the azimuthal correlation between the produced DY pair and a forward pion
taking into account the Z 0 boson contribution in addition to virtual photon, generalising thus the results presented
in Ref. [13].

This paper is organized as follows. In the Section II, we present a brief overview of gauge boson production in the
color dipole framework. Moreover, we discuss in detail the saturation eﬀects, gluon shadowing and initial-state energy
loss eﬀects included in the analysis. Section III is devoted to predictions for the dilepton invariant mass, rapidity
and transverse momentum distributions of the DY nuclear production cross sections in comparison with the available
data. The onset of various nuclear eﬀects is estimated in the LCL limit and the predictions for the nucleus-to-nucleon
1, of the DY production cross sections are presented. The latter can be veriﬁed in the future by
ratio, RpA = σpA/Aσpp
experiments at RHIC an LHC. Furthermore, the azimuthal correlation function between the produced dilepton and a
pion is evaluated for pA collisions at RHIC and LHC for diﬀerent dilepton invariant masses including the high-mass
region. Finally, in Section IV we summarise our main conclusions.

II. DRELL-YAN PROCESS IN HADRON-NUCLEUS COLLISIONS

A. DY nuclear cross section

The color dipole formalism is treated in the target rest frame where the process of DY pair production can be
viewed as a radiation of gauge bosons G∗ = γ∗/Z 0 by a projectile quark (see e.g. Ref. [10, 12]). Assuming only the
lowest |qG∗i Fock component, the cross section for the inclusive gauge boson production with invariant mass Ml¯l and
transverse momentum pT can be expressed in terms of the projectile quark (antiquark) densities qf (¯qf ) at momentum
fraction xq and the quark-nucleus cross section as follows (see e.g. Refs. [7, 12]),

gauge boson G∗, xq = x1/α, where α is the fraction of the light-cone momentum of the projectile quark carried out
by the gauge boson, and µ2
[12] we take
µF ≃ Ml¯l, for simplicity.
The transverse momentum distribution in Eq. (2) of the gauge boson G∗ bremsstrahlung in quark-nucleus interac-
tions can be obtained by a generalization of the well-known formulas for the photon bremsstrahlung from Refs. [5, 7, 8].
Then the corresponding diﬀerential cross section for a given incoming quark of ﬂavour f reads,

Our goal is to evaluate the DY production cross section in pA collisions at high energies and a large mass number A
of the nuclear target. This regime is characterised by a limitation on the maximum phase-space parton density that
can be reached in the hadron wave function (parton saturation) [14]. The transition between the linear and non-linear
regimes of QCD dynamics is typically speciﬁed by a characteristic energy-dependent scale called the saturation scale
Q2
s, where the variable s denotes c.m. energy squared of the collision. Such saturation eﬀects are expected to be
ampliﬁed in nuclear collisions since the nuclear saturation scale Q2
s,A is expected to be enlarged with respect to the
nucleon one Q2

s,p by rougthly a factor of A1/3.
In general, the dipole-nucleus cross section σA

q ¯q(ρ, x) can be written in terms of the forward dipole-nucleus scattering

amplitude N A(ρ, x, b) as follows,

σA

q ¯q(ρ, x) = 2 Z d2bN A(ρ, x, b) .

(6)

At high energies, the evolution of N A(x, r, b) in rapidity Y = ln(1/x) is given, for example, within the Color Glass
Condensate (CGC) formalism [15], in terms of an inﬁnite hierarchy of equations known as so called Balitsky-JIMWLK
equations [15, 16], which reduces in the mean ﬁeld approximation to the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation [16, 17].
In recent years, several groups have studied the solution of the BK equation taking into account the running coupling
corrections to the evolution kernel. However, these analyses have assumed the translational invariance approximation,
which implies that N A(ρ, x, b) = N A(ρ, x) S(b) and σA
q ¯q(ρ, x, b) = σ0 N (ρ, x), where N (ρ, x) is a partial dipole
amplitude on a nucleon, and σ0 is the normalization of the dipole cross section ﬁtted to the data. Basically, they
disregard the impact parameter dependence. Unfortunately, the impact-parameter dependent numerical solutions of
the BK equation are very diﬃcult to obtain [18]. Moreover, the choice of the impact-parameter proﬁle of the dipole
amplitude entails intrinsically nonperturbative physics, which is beyond the QCD weak coupling approach of the BK
equation. In what follows, we explore an alternative path and employ the available phenomenological models, which
explicitly incorporate an expected b-dependence of the scattering amplitude.

B. Models for the dipole cross section

As in our previous studies [19–24], we work in the LCL limit and employ the model initially proposed in Ref. [25]
which includes the impact parameter dependence in the dipole-nucleus amplitude and describes the experimental
data on the nuclear structure function (for more details, see Ref. [19, 26]). In particular, this model enables us to
incorporate the shadowing eﬀects via a simple eikonalization of the standard dipole-nucleon cross section σq ¯q(ρ, x)
such that the forward dipole-nucleus amplitude in Eq. (6) is given by

N A(ρ, x, b) = 1 − exp(cid:18)−

1
2

TA(b) σq ¯q(ρ, x)(cid:19) ,

where TA(b) is the nuclear proﬁle (thickness) function, which is normalized to the mass number A and reads

TA(b) = Z ∞

−∞

ρA(b, z)dz .

(7)

(8)

Here ρA(b, z) represents the nuclear density function deﬁned at the impact parameter b and the longitudinal coordinate
z. In our calculations we used realistic parametrizations of ρA(b, z) from Ref. [27]. The eikonal formula (7) based
upon the Glauber-Gribov formalism [28] resums the multiple elastic rescattering diagrams of the q ¯q dipole in a nucleus
in the high-energy limit. The eikonalisation procedure is justiﬁed in the LCL regime where the transverse separation
ρ of partons in the multiparton Fock state of the photon is frozen during propagation through the nuclear matter and
becomes an eigenvalue of the scattering matrix.

For the numerical analysis of the nuclear DY observables, we need to specify a reliable parametrisation for the
dipole-proton cross section. In recent years, several groups have constructed a number of viable phenomenological
models based on saturation physics and ﬁts to the HERA and RHIC data (see e.g. Refs. [29–41]).

As in our previous study of the DY process in pp collisions [12], in order to estimate theoretical uncertainty in our
analysis, in what follows, we consider several phenomenological models for the dipole cross section σq ¯q which take
into account the DGLAP evolution as well as the saturation eﬀects.

The ﬁrst one is the model proposed in Ref. [38], where the dipole cross section is given by

σq ¯q(ρ, x) = σ0 (cid:20)1 − exp(cid:18)−

π2

σ0 Nc

ρ2 αs(µ2) xg(x, µ2)(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(9)

where Nc = 3 is the number of colors, αs(µ2) is the strong coupling constant at µ scale, which is related to the dipole
size ρ as µ2 = C/ρ2 + µ2
0 with C, µ0 and σ0 parameters ﬁtted to the HERA data. Moreover, in this model the gluon
density evolves according to DGLAP equation [42] accounting for gluon splittings only,

where the gluon density at initial scale µ2

0 is parametrized as [38]

xg(x, µ2

0) = Agx−λg (1 − x)5.6 .

(10)

(11)

The set of best ﬁt values of the model parameters reads: Ag = 1.2, λg = 0.28, µ2
0 = 0.52 GeV2, C = 0.26 and σ0 = 23
mb. In what follows we denote by BGBK the predictions for the DY observables obtained using Eq. (9) as an input
in calculations of the dipole-nucleus scattering amplitude.

The model proposed in Ref. [38] was generalised in Ref. [35] in order to take into account the impact parameter
dependence of the dipole-proton cross section and to describe the exclusive observables at HERA. In this model, the
corresponding dipole-proton cross section is given by

σq ¯q(ρ, x) = 2 Z d2bp (cid:20)1 − exp(cid:18)−

π2
2Nc

ρ2 αs(µ2) xg(x, µ2)TG(bp)(cid:19)(cid:21)

(12)

with the DGLAP evolution of the gluon distribution given by Eq. (10). The Gaussian impact parameter dependence
is given by TG(bp) = (1/2πBG) exp(−b2
p/2BG), where BG is a free parameter extracted from the t-dependence of the
exclusive electron-proton (ep) data. The parameters of this model were updated in Ref. [40] by ﬁtting to the recent
0 = 1.428 GeV2, BG = 4.0
high precision HERA data [43] providing the following values: Ag = 2.373, λg = 0.052, µ2
GeV2 and C = 4.0. Hereafter, we will denote as IP-SAT the resulting predictions obtained using Eq. (12) as an input
in calculations of N A, Eq. (7).
(GBW) model [29] based upon a simpliﬁed saturated form

For comparison with the previous results existing in the literature, we also consider the Golec-Biernat-Wusthoﬀ

Finally, we also consider the running coupling solution of the BK equation for the partial dipole amplitude obtained
q ¯q(ρ, x) = σ0 N p(ρ, x) where the normalisation

in the Ref. [44] using the GBW model as an initial condition such that σp
σ0 is ﬁtted to the HERA data.

C. Gluon shadowing corrections

In the LHC energy range the eikonal formula for the LCL regime, Eq. (7), is not exact. Besides the lowest |qG∗i
Fock state, where G∗ = γ∗/Z 0, one should include also the higher Fock components containing gluons, e.g. |qG∗ gi,
|qG∗ ggi, etc. They cause an additional suppression known as the gluon shadowing (GS). Such high LHC energies
allow so to activate the coherence eﬀects also for these gluon ﬂuctuations, which are heavier and consequently have a
shorter coherence length than lowest Fock component |qG∗i. The corresponding suppression factor RG, as the ratio
of the gluon densities in nuclei and nucleon, was derived in Ref. [45] using the Green function technique through the

calculation of the inelastic correction ∆σtot(q ¯qg) to the total cross section σγ ∗ A

GS corrections are included in calculations replacing σN
q ¯q(ρ, x) RG(x, Q2, b). They lead to additional
nuclear suppression in production of DY pairs at small Bjorken x = x2 in the target. In Fig. 2 (left panel) we present
our results for the x dependence of the ratio RG(x, Q2, b) for diﬀerent vales of the impact parameter b. As expected,
the magnitude of the shadowing corrections decreases at large values of b. In the right panel we present our predictions
for the b-integrated nuclear ratio RG(x, Q2) for diﬀerent values of the hard scale Q2. This ﬁgure shows a not very
strong onset of GS, which was conﬁrmed by the NLO global analyses of DIS data [46]. A weak Q2 dependence of GS
demonstrates that GS is a leading twist eﬀect, with RG(x, Q2) approaching unity only very slowly (logarithmically)
as Q2 → ∞.

The eﬀective initial-state energy loss (ISI eﬀects) is expected to suppress noticeably the nuclear cross section when

reaching the kinematical limits,

xL =

2pL√s → 1 ,

xT =

L + x2

Correspondingly, a proper variable which controls this eﬀect is ξ = px2
T . The magnitude of suppression was
evaluated in Ref. [47]. It was found within the Glauber approximation that each interaction in the nucleus leads to a
suppression factor S(ξ) ≈ 1 − ξ. Summing up over the multiple initial state interactions in a pA collision at impact
parameter b, one arrives at a nuclear ISI-modiﬁed PDF

.

(16)

Here, σeﬀ = 20 mb is the eﬀective hadronic cross section controlling the multiple interactions. The normalisation
factor Cv is ﬁxed by the Gottfried sum rule (for more details, see Ref. [47]). It was found that such an additional
nuclear suppression emerging due to the ISI eﬀects represents an energy independent feature common for all known
reactions experimentally studied so far, with any leading particle (hadrons, Drell-Yan dileptons, charmonium, etc).
In particular, such a suppression was indicated at midrapidity, y = 0, and at large pT by the PHENIX data [48] on
π0 production in central dAu collisions and on direct photon production in central AuAu collisions [49], where no
shadowing is expected since the corresponding Bjorken x = x2 in the target is large. Besides large pT -values, the
same mechanism of nuclear attenuation is eﬀective also at forward rapidities (large Feynman xF ), where we expect a
much stronger onset of nuclear suppression as was demonstrated by the BRAHMS and STAR data [50]. In our case,
we predict that the ISI eﬀects induce a signiﬁcant suppression of the DY nuclear cross section at large dilepton pT ,
dilepton invariant mass and at forward rapidities as one can see in the next Section.

III. RESULTS

7

In what follows, we present our predictions for the DY pair production cross section in the process pA → γ∗/Z 0 → l¯l
obtained within the color dipole formalism and taking into account the medium eﬀects discussed in the previous
Section. Following Ref. [29], we use the quark mass values to be mu = md = ms = 0.14 GeV, mc = 1.4 GeV and
mb = 4.5 GeV. Moreover, we take the factorisation scale µF deﬁned above to be equal to the dilepton invariant
mass, Ml¯l, and employ the CT10 NLO parametrisation for the projectile quark PDFs [51] (both sea and valence
quarks are included). As was demonstrated in Refs. [12, 52], there is a little sensitivity of DY predictions on PDF
parameterisation in pp collisions at high energies so we do not vary the projectile quark PDFs.

FIG. 3: (Color online) The dipole model predictions for the DY nuclear cross sections at large dilepton invariant masses
compared to the recent experimental data from ATLAS and CMS experiments [53, 54] at c.m. collision energy √s = 5.02 TeV.
The predictions obtained for several parameterisations of the dipole cross section described in the text are shown in the top
panels while the eﬀects of the gluon shadowing and the initial-state energy loss are demonstrated in the bottom panels.

In Fig. 3 we compare our predictions for the DY nuclear cross section with available LHC data [53, 54] for large
invariant dilepton masses, 60 < Ml¯l < 120 GeV, taking into account the saturation eﬀects. In the top panels, we
test the predictions of various models for the dipole cross section comparing them with the experimental data for the
rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of the DY production cross sections in pA collisions. As was already
veriﬁed in Ref. [12] for DY production in pp collisions, the dipole approach works fairly well in description of the
current experimental data at high energies. In particular, the BGBK model provides a consistent prediction describing
the data on the rapidity distribution quite well in the full kinematical range. In the bottom panels of Fig. 3, we took
the BGBK model and considered the impact of gluon shadowing corrections as well as the initial-state eﬀective energy
loss (ISI eﬀects), Eq. (16). In the range of large dilepton invariant masses concerned, the gluon shadowing corrections
are rather small since the corresponding Bjorken x = x2 in the target becomes large. On the other hand, the ISI
eﬀects signiﬁcantly modify the behaviour of the rapidity distribution at large η > 2. Unfortunately, the current data
are not able at this moment to verify the predicted strong onset of ISI eﬀects due to large error bars. In the case
of the transverse momentum distribution for large invariant masses and 0 ≤ η ≤ 2, the impact of both the gluon
shadowing and the ISI eﬀects is negligible.
In order to quantify the impact of the nuclear eﬀects, in what follows, we estimate the invariant mass, rapidity
and transverse momentum dependence of the nucleus-to-nucleon ratio of the DY production cross sections (nuclear

In Fig. 4 we present our predictions for the dilepton invariant mass dependence of the ratio RpA(Ml¯l) at RHIC
In the top panels, we show that the dipole model predictions
considering both central and forward rapidities.
are almost insensitive to the parameterisations used to treat the dipole-proton interactions. The magnitude of the
saturation eﬀects decreases at large dilepton invariant masses and increases at forward rapidities. Such a behaviour
is expected, since at smaller Ml¯l and at larger η one probes smaller values of the Bjorken-x2 variable in the target. In
the bottom panels of Fig. 4, we present the predictions taking into account also the GS corrections and ISI eﬀects. As
was mentioned above we predict a weak onset of GS corrections at central rapidities whereas GS leads to a signiﬁcant
suppression in the forward region. Besides, as expected, the impact of GS eﬀects decreases with Ml¯l due to rise of
the Bjorken x2-values. In contrast to that, the ISI eﬀects become eﬀective causing a strong nuclear suppression at
large Ml¯l and/or η. This behaviour is also well understood since large dilepton invariant masses and/or rapidities
correspond to large Feynman xF leading to a stronger onset of ISI eﬀects as follows from Eq. (16). A similar behaviour
has been predicted for the LHC energy range as is shown in Fig. 5 where the impact of saturation and GS eﬀects is
even more pronounced.

In Fig. 6 we present our predictions for rapidity dependence of the nucleus-to-nucleon ratio, RpA(η), of the DY
production cross sections at RHIC and LHC energies considering two ranges, (5 < Ml¯l < 25 GeV) and (60 < Ml¯l < 120
GeV), of dilepton invariant mass. We would like to emphasize that the onset of saturation eﬀects reduces RpA(η) at
large rapidities and have a larger impact in the small invariant mass range. For large invariant masses, we predict
a reduction of ≈ 10% in the RpP b ratio at LHC energy. At RHIC energy we predict a weak onset of GS eﬀects
even at large η > 3. In contrast to RHIC energy range, at the LHC the GS eﬀects lead to a signiﬁcant additional
suppression, modifying thus the ratio RpP b especially at small dilepton invariant masses and large rapidity values. On
the other hand, the onset of the ISI eﬀects is rather strong for both RHIC and LHC kinematic regions, and becomes
even stronger at forward rapidities for both invariant mass ranges. This makes the phenomenological studies of the

rapidity dependence of RpA ideal for constraining such eﬀects.
Fig. 7 shows our predictions for the transverse momentum dependence of the nuclear modiﬁcation factor, RpA(pT ),
for the invariant mass range 5 < Ml¯l < 25 GeV at RHIC c.m. energy √s = 0.2 TeV and two distinct pseudorapidity
values η = 0 and η = 1. At large transverse momenta, the role of the saturation eﬀects is negligibly small and can be
important only at small pT ≤ 2 GeV. Similarly, the GS eﬀects are almost irrelevant at RHIC energies. However, Fig. 7
clearly demonstrates a strong onset of ISI eﬀects causing a signiﬁcant suppression at large pT , where no coherence
eﬀects are expected. In accordance with Eq. (16) and in comparison with η = 0, we predict stronger ISI eﬀects at
forward rapidities as is depicted in Fig. 7 for η = 1. Due to a signiﬁcant elimination of coherence eﬀects the study
of the DY process at large pT in pA collisions at RHIC is a very convenient tool for investigation of net ISI eﬀects.
On the other hand, at LHC energies (see Fig. 8) the manifestation of the saturation and GS eﬀects rises at forward
rapidities and becomes noticeable for pT ≤ 10 GeV. As was already mentioned for RHIC energies, the ISI eﬀects cause
a signiﬁcant attenuation at large transverse momenta and forward rapidities, although no substantial suppression is
expected in the DY process due to absence of the ﬁnal state interaction, energy loss or absorption. For these reasons
a study of the ratio RpA(pT ) also at the LHC especially at large pT and at small invariant mass range is very eﬀective
to constrain the ISI eﬀects.

In order to reduce the contribution of coherence eﬀects (gluon shadowing, CGC) in the LHC kinematic region one
should go to the range of large dilepton invariant masses as is shown in Fig. 9. Here we present our predictions for
the ratio RpP b(pT ) at the LHC c.m. collision energy √s = 5.02 TeV for the range 60 < Ml¯l < 120 GeV and several
values of η = 0, 2, 4. According to expectations we have found that the saturation and GS eﬀects turn out to be
important only at small pT and large η. Such an elimination of coherence eﬀects taking into account larger dilepton
invariant masses causes simultaneously a stronger onset of ISI eﬀects as one can seen in Fig. 9 in comparison with
Fig. 8. For this reason, investigation of net ISI eﬀects at large Ml¯l does not require such high pT - and rapidity values,
what allows to obtain the experimental data of higher statistics and consequently with smaller error bars. Fig. 9
demonstrates again a large nuclear suppression in the forward region (η = 4) over an extended range of the dilepton
transverse momenta. Consequently, such an analysis of the DY nuclear cross section at forward rapidities by e.g. the
LHCb Collaboration can be very useful to probe the ISI eﬀects experimentally.

Finally, let us discuss the azimuthal correlation between the DY pair and a forward pion produced in pA collisions

taking into account the Z 0 boson contribution in addition to the virtual photon as well as the saturation eﬀects. As
was discussed earlier in Refs. [12, 13, 55], the dilepton-hadron correlations can serve as an eﬃcient probe of the initial

decorrelation between the back-to-back jets. In the case of pA collisions, the magnitude of the saturation scale is
1
ampliﬁed by the factor A
3 . Consequently, we should also expect the presence a double-peak structure of C(∆φ) in the
away side dilepton-pion angular correlation in pA collisions. This expectation is veriﬁed in our predictions presented
in Fig. 10, where we show our predictions for the correlation function C(∆φ) of the associated DY pair and pion in
pA collisions at LHC energies and diﬀerent values of the atomic mass number. We have that larger values of A implies
the smearing of the the back-to-back scattering pattern and suppress the away-side peak in the ∆φ distribution. Our
predictions for the RHIC and LHC kinematical regions are presented in Fig. 11, which agree with the results for
small invariant masses presented in Refs. [12, 13]. In variance with our results for pp collisions [12], we also predict
a double-peak structure for large invariant masses. This new result is directly associated with the larger value of
the saturation scale present in pA collisions and to the fact that the typical momentum transverse of the produced
particles is smaller in pA collisions at √s = 5.02 TeV than for pp collisions at √s = 14 TeV. As a consequence, the
eﬀect of the transverse momentum of the exchanged gluon is larger, implying the imbalance of the back-to-back jets
also for large invariant masses in pA collisions, generating thus the double-peak structure observed in Fig. 11.

IV. SUMMARY

In this paper, we carried out an extensive phenomenological analysis of the inclusive DY γ∗/Z 0 → l¯l process in pA
collisions within the color dipole approach. At large dilepton invariant masses the Z 0 contribution becomes relevant.
The corresponding predictions for the dilepton invariant mass and transverse momentum diﬀerential distributions
have been compared with available data at the LHC and a reasonable agreement was found. The invariant mass,
rapidity and transverse momentum dependencies of the nucleus-to-nucleon ratio of production cross sections, RpA =
σDY
pA /(A · σDY
pp ), were estimated taking into account such nuclear eﬀects as the saturation, gluon shadowing GS and
initial state energy loss eﬀects (ISI eﬀects).
In comparison with other processes with inclusive particle production, the DY reaction is very eﬀective tool for
study of nuclear eﬀects since no ﬁnal state interaction is expected, either the energy loss or absorption. For this
reason the DY process represents a cleaner probe for the medium created not only in pA interactions but also in

heavy ion collisions. Our results demonstrate that the analysis of the DY process oﬀ nuclei in diﬀerent kinematic
regions allows us to investigate the magnitude of particular nuclear eﬀects. We found that both GS and ISI eﬀects
cause a signiﬁcant suppression in DY production. Whereas GS eﬀects dominate at small Bjorken-x in the target the
ISI eﬀects (in accordance with Eq. (16)) become eﬀective at large transverse momenta pT and invariant masses Ml¯l
of dilepton pairs as well as at large Feynman xF (forward rapidities). Consequently, at forward rapidities in some
kinematic regions at the LHC one can investigate only a mixing of both eﬀects even at large pT - values. However, in
contrast to other inclusive processes, the advantage of the DY reaction arises in elimination of the GS-ISI mixing by
elimination of coherence eﬀects going to larger values of the dilepton invariant mass. Then an investigation of nuclear
suppression at large pT represents a clear manifestation of net ISI eﬀects even at forward rapidities as is demonstrated
in Fig. 9. Such a study of nuclear suppression at large dilepton invariant masses, transverse momenta and rapidities
especially at the LHC energy favours the DY process as an eﬀective tool for investigation of net ISI eﬀects.

Besides, we have analysed the correlation function C(∆φ) in azimuthal angle ∆φ between the produced dilepton
and a forward pion, which results by a fragmentation from a projectile quark radiating the virtual gauge boson. The
corresponding observable has been studied at various energies in pA collisions in both the low and high dilepton
invariant mass ranges as well as at diﬀerent rapidities of ﬁnal states. We found a characteristic double-peak structure
of the correlation function around ∆φ ≃ π at various dilepton mass values and for a very forward pion. The considering
observable is more exclusive than the ordinary DY process. Such a measurement at diﬀerent energies at RHIC and
LHC is therefore capable of setting further even stronger constraints on saturation physics.
