Introduction

Kriecherbauer and McLaughlin [8] used the Riemann-Hilbert approach to study the strong
asymptotics of the polynomials orthogonal with respect to the Freud weight

wβ(x)dx = e−κβ|x|β

, β > 0.

(1)

When 0 < β < 1, several representative results are obtained in terms of a model Riemann-
Hilbert problem (RHP) for a certain 2 × 2 matrix-valued function L:

L : C\R → C2×2 is analytic,
L+(s) = L−(s)vL(s) for s ∈ R,
L(s) = O(ln |s|) as s → 0,

L(s) → I for s → ∞,

and n being the polynomial degree; see [8, (6.41)-(6.43)].

Later in this note, we will give a more natural description of the behavior of L(s) at the

origin. Instead of (3), we henceforth assume

ln |s|,
|s|β−1/2, 0 < β < 1/2.

1/2 < β < 1,
β = 1/2,

(5)

ǫβ(s) =


L(s) = O (ǫβ(s)) as s → 0,

Remark 1. The uniqueness of the solution to the RHP for L, subject to either (3) or (5), can
be justiﬁed by using Liouville’s theorem. Now let L3(s) be the solution to the RHP with local
behavior (3), and L5(s) be that with local behavior (5), then L3(s)L−1
5 (s) has no jump on the
real line R, and has only an isolated singularity at the origin. Since the singularity at the origin
is not a pole or an essential singularity, it must be removable. In addition, since L3(s)L−1
5 (s)
approaches I as s → ∞, by Liouville’s theorem this matrix-valued entire function is the identity
matrix. Thus L3(s) ≡ L5(s) if both solutions exist.
In view of Lemma 2 below, the local
behavior in (5) is in a sense more natural. Later in Section 4, we will see from Theorem 3 that
we actually have L(s) = O(1) as s → 0 for the parametrix constructed in (13). Accordingly,
both (3) and (5) are fulﬁlled.

In [8], the existence and uniqueness of L were established in the Wiener class. For 0 < β < 1,
the leading order behavior of the solution to the model problem at the origin has not been
determined explicitly; see the comment in Deift et al. [5, p.62, Remark 3.6]. For a brief historical
account of the asymptotics of the orthogonal polynomials associated with the Freud weight, the
reader is referred to [8] and the references therein.

Recently, there are other orthogonal polynomials with weights having similar singularities
as the Freud weight. For example, Chen and Ismail [2] considered the Freud-like orthogonal
polynomials arising from a recurrence relation. The polynomials are related to the indeterminate
moment problems. The weight function, supported on R, has a singularity at 0 which is similar
to the Freud weight (1); see also [3, (1.6)] for the weight, and for a diﬀerence equation approach
to obtain the Plancherel-Rotach asymptotics.

In [4], Dea˜no, Kuijlaars and Rom´an consider the zero distribution of polynomials orthogonal
with respect to the Bessel function Jν(x). They encountered a varying exponential weight of
Freud type enπ|x| with a potential function π|x|. To justify the existence of a certain local
parametrix, a quite unnatural restriction on ν has to be brought in. Again, the leading order
behavior of the parametrix has not been explicitly given.

To solve those parametrices and model problems, one may either represent them in terms of
known special functions, or alternatively use new special functions to serve the same purpose.
The objective of the present note is to introduce a pair of special functions, uβ and vβ,
determined by two linear integral equations. Based on these functions, the solution to the
model problem of Kriecherbauer and McLaughlin [8] can readily be constructed.

2

In the rest of this note, we will address the unique solvability of the integral equations in
C[0, ∞), derive the behavior of the speciﬁc solutions uβ and vβ at inﬁnity and at the origin,
and carry out a brief discussion of the Stokes phenomena of these functions, taking the integral
equations as resurgent relations. We will also propose a thorough investigation of the analytic
and asymptotic properties of the new special functions uβ and vβ, and a relevant new special
function Gβ.

Integral equations and the RH problem

First, let us derive the integral equations from the model problem for L formulated in Section
1. From the jump condition (2) and the behavior (4)-(5), it is readily seen that the (1, 1)-entry
L11(s) is analytic in C \ (−∞, 0], such that

(L11)+ (s) − (L11)− (s) = ηL(−s)L12(s), s ∈ (−∞, 0),
L11(s) = 1 + o(1), s → ∞,
L11(s) = O(ǫβ(s)), s → 0.

Hence, in view of the behavior of L12; cf. (4)-(5), we have

L11(s) = 1 +

2πiZ 0

2πiZ ∞

0

ηL(τ )L12(−τ )dτ

−τ − s

(6)

for s ∈ C \ (−∞, 0], especially for s ∈ (0, ∞). Similarly, it is also seen from (2) that L12(s) is
analytic in C \ [0, ∞), and solves the scalar RH problem

(L12)+ (s) − (L12)− (s) = −ηL(s)L11(s), s ∈ (0, ∞),
L12(s) = o(1), s → ∞,
L12(s) = O(ǫβ(s)), s → 0.

Hence, we have

L12(s) =

1

2πiZ ∞

0

−ηL(τ )L11(τ )dτ

τ − s

for s ∈ C \ [0, ∞),

especially for s ∈ (−∞, 0). For x ∈ (0, +∞), now we deﬁne

uβ(x) = L11(x) + (−1)nL12(−x), vβ(x) = L11(x) − (−1)nL12(−x).

(7)

(8)

From (6)-(7) and (8), it is readily veriﬁed that uβ and vβ solve, respectively, the following
integral equations

u(x) = 1 +Z ∞
v(x) = 1 −Z ∞

and ηL(t) = 2πi(−1)n+1K(t) for t ∈ [0, +∞).

It is worth noting that similar coupled scalar integral equations have been derived in [4],
though the equations in that paper were used only to construct a contraction mapping. Also, it
is mentioned in Fokas et al. [6, p.161] that a function u(x) can be parametrized via the solution
of a linear integral equation. This is exactly what we are doing: We are deﬁning a pair of new
special functions, using the above integral equations, to construct a parametrix.

Conversely, if uβ(x) and vβ(x) do solve the integral equations, with uβ −1, vβ −1 ∈ L2[0, ∞),
then we can deduce that uβ(z), vβ(z) = 1 + O(1/z) as z → ∞ for | arg z| < 3π/2 and are of the
order O(ǫβ(z)) as z → 0 for | arg z| ≤ π; see the discussion in the next section, and especially
Lemma 2. Thus, we have

arg z ∈ (−∞, ∞), z 6= 0.

3 Unique solvability of the integral equations

In [8], the unique solvability of the model problem for L is justiﬁed in the Wiener class; i.e., the
Fourier transform of each entry is in L1(R).

We note that in view of (14) the unique solvability of the integral equations (9)-(10) can

accordingly be deduced from that of L.

Now we take an alternative approach, using the integral equations alone. We ﬁrst show that

both uβ(x) − 1 and vβ(x) − 1 are in L2[0, +∞). We begin with the following lemma:

Lemma 1. The operator T is a compact operator on L2[0, +∞), where

(T u)(x) =Z ∞

0

K(t)u(t)dt

t + x

.

(15)

Proof. The lemma is easily justiﬁed by noting that K(t)
is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator, and hence is compact; cf. e.g. [16, p.277].

t+x ∈ L2([0, +∞) × [0, +∞)). Thus, T

The next step is to show that the operator I − T has trivial null space. To this aim, we
need to know more about the analytic structure of the solutions to (9) and (10). Indeed, if u(x)
solves (9), then we see from equation (9) that u can be extended analytically to C \(−∞, 0], and
that u(z) = 1 + O(1/z) in subsectors. From (11), we see that the kernel K(t) can be extended
analytically to complex t with arg t ∈ (−∞, ∞), and is exponentially small for | arg t| < π/2.
Using Cauchy’s theorem, it can be shown that

u(z) = 1 +Z ∞

0

K(teiθ)u(teiθ)dt

t + e−iθz

,

|θ| <

π
2

,

4

(16)

which enables us to extend u(z) to the larger sector | arg z| < 3π/2, and

u(z) = 1 + O(1/z), as z → ∞,

| arg z| < 3π/2.

(17)

Similar results can be obtained for v(z). This procedure can be continued, since by using the
Plemelj formula we have from (9)-(10)

u(ze−πi) − u(zeπi) = 2πiK(z)u(z), v(ze−πi) − v(zeπi) = −2πiK(z)v(z),

(18)

initially for real and positive z, and then for complex z. Appealing to the formulas in (18), we
see that the above process of analytic continuation can keep on going until we have the results
valid for arg z ∈ R. For later use, we need the following behavior of (T u)(z) at the origin:

Lemma 2. For u ∈ L2[0, +∞), we have (T u)(z) = O(ǫβ(z)) for | arg z| ≤ π as z → 0; cf. (5),

where ǫβ(z) =


1,
ln |z|,
|z|β−1/2, 0 < β < 1/2.

1/2 < β < 1,
β = 1/2,

Proof. Recall the function K(t) in (12). For real and positive z, we have by using H¨older’s
inequality and splitting the interval of integration

|(T u)(z)|2 ≤ kuk2

2Z ∞

0

K(t)2dt

(t + z)2 = O(cid:18)Z 1

0

t2βdt

(t + z)2(cid:19) + O(1) = O(ǫβ(z))

as z → 0. The last equality can be obtained by calculating a residue. With slight modiﬁcations,
and taking into account the rotation formula (16), we can extend the above inequality to
| arg z| ≤ π.

We show that the operator I −T has trivial null space, by using a vanishing lemma technique.

Similar argument can be found in, e.g., [8].

Lemma 3. Assume that u ∈ L2[0, +∞) and u − T u = 0 in L2[0, +∞). Then it holds u ≡ 0 for
x ∈ [0, ∞) in L2[0, +∞).

Proof.
Indeed, from u = T u we see that the above analytic continuation procedure works
also for the present u(z), the connection formula (18) still holds, and instead of (17) we have
u(z) = O(1/z) as z → ∞ for | arg z| ≤ π. We introduce an auxiliary vector function

A(z) =( (cid:0) u(z), u(ze−πi) (cid:1) , arg z ∈ (0, π),

arg z ∈ (−π, 0).

(cid:0) u(z), u(zeπi) (cid:1) ,

It is readily seen that A(z) is analytic in both the upper and lower half plane, behaves uniformly
as O(1/z) at inﬁnity, and has jumps along the real axis as

A+(x) = A−(x)JA(x), JA(x) =

Denote by A∗ the conjugate transpose of A. Since A+A∗

− has an analytic continuation to
+ to the lower half, in view of the behavior A(z) = O(1/z) at

the upper half plane, and A−A∗
inﬁnity, by the Cauchy integral theorem we have

−(x)dx =ZR
−(x)dx =ZR

A+(x)A∗

−(x)dx = 0,

A−(x)A∗

+(x)dx = 0.

Here, use has also been made of the fact that u(z) = O(ǫβ(z)) for small z with | arg z| ≤ π; see
Lemma 2. Summing up the integrals gives

A−(x) (JA(x) + J ∗

A(x)) A∗

−(x)dx = 0.

(19)

It can be seen from (12) that |πiK(|x|)| < 1 for x ∈ R. Hence,

(cid:19)

is positive deﬁnite for x ∈ R. From (19) one deduces that A−(x) ≡ 0, and thus u(x) ≡ 0 for
x ∈ (0, +∞).

K(t)dt
t+x ∈ L2[0, +∞) since it is smooth on (0, ∞), bounded at 0+, and of
order O(1/x) at +∞. Hence, a combination of Lemmas 1 and 3 gives the unique solvability of
the following integral equation

We note that R ∞

K(t)dt

in the space L2[0, +∞). Similar analysis can be carried out for the other equation (10). To
conclude, we have the following:

Theorem 2. There exist unique solutions u(x) and v(x) to the integral equations (9) and (10),
respectively, such that u(x) − 1 ∈ L2[0, +∞) and v(x) − 1 ∈ L2[0, +∞).

4 Boundedness of uβ(x) and vβ(x) on [0, ∞)

The main result in the last section is that uβ(x) − 1 ∈ L2[0, +∞). By using successive approxi-
mation, one can actually show that uβ(x) is continuous and bounded for β > βc :=0.4158853544.
Indeed, it suﬃces to show that the operator T deﬁned in (15) is a contraction on the space L∞
for those β. Straightforward estimation gives

The bound cot( πβ

2 )/πβ is monotonically decreasing for β ∈ (0, 1), and is less than 1 for β > βc.
In this section, we shall show that uβ(x) and vβ(x) are in fact bounded for all β ∈ (0, 1).

Theorem 3. Let uβ(x) and vβ(x) be solutions of the integral equations in (9) and (10), respec-
tively. Then, uβ(x), vβ(x) ∈ L∞[0, ∞) and uβ(x), vβ(x) ∈ C[0, ∞).

Proof. Let ˜u(x) = uβ(x) − 1. By Theorem 2, ˜u(x) ∈ L2[0, ∞). Rewrite equation (9) as

˜u(x) =Z ∞

Clearly, u0(x) ∈ L2[0, ∞) ∩ L∞[0, ∞). The function ˜u(x) is smooth in (0, ∞), since it is an
analytic function in the cut plane C \ (−∞, 0]. To prove that ˜u(x) is also bounded there, we
divide our discussion into several cases. In general, for all β ∈ (0, 1), we have

This establishes the boundedness of uβ(x) for x ∈ (0, 1], and hence also for x ∈ (0, ∞). Since
uβ(x) is bounded on (0, ∞), the continuity of uβ(x) at x = 0 from the right now follows from
equation (9) and the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem.

An analogous argument gives vβ(x) ∈ L∞[0, ∞) and vβ(x) ∈ C[0, ∞).

To satisfy certain jump conditions and matching conditions, the Stokes phenomenon plays a
crucial role in the construction of local parametrices for RHPs. Now we turn to a brief discussion
of the Stokes phenomena of uβ and vβ, based on the connection formulas in (18), and regarding
equations (9)-(10) as exact resurgence relations. A similar analysis was carried out in Boyd [1]
for the modiﬁed Bessel function; see also Xu and Zhao [15] for an attempt to link together the
RH approach with resurgence properties.

Assume that u(x) = uβ(x) solves the integral equation (9) with u − 1 ∈ L2[0, ∞), and u(z)
In general, we see that u(z) = 1 + O(1/z) for large z as

| arg z| < 3π

2 ; cf. (17). Coupling (17) and (18), one can verify that

u(z) = 1 + O(cid:18) 1

2 ; see also (11). The term on the extreme right is exponentially large, when
arg z goes beyond 3π
2 . According to Berry’s Stokes smoothing, the switch-on of the exponential
occurs when 1 + O(1/z) is the most dominant as compared with the exponential term, namely,
2β . We give some details in what follows.

initially for real positive z, and then extended elsewhere. Now we assume that β ∈ [1/3, 1), and
take IN (z) as an example. Rotating the integration path clockwise to arg t = φ ∈ [−π, 0), and
making a change of variables t = e−πizτ α with α = 1/β, we have

rotated the path arg τ = φ + π to the positive real line.

2 (3 − α)(cid:1), the large parameter is ρ = |z|β, and the path of integration is

Substitute the identity

τ α−1 into the integral in (25). The remainder
in the resulting expansion is an integral with a saddle point as well as a pole. Optimal truncation
of the expansion occurs when the saddle point coalesces with the pole (see [1, 13]); that is, when
ρ ≈ N α or, more precisely, αN = ρ + r, with r being bounded. The result we have now is an
exponentially improved asymptotic expansion, whose error term is given by

which exhibits a Stokes smoothing of error-function type as θ → 0− when the saddle point
τ = e−iθ coalesces with the simple pole τ = 1. This indicates that in our case a Stokes line
occurs when we have θ = 0, i.e., arg z = π
2 (3 − α). The analysis for the other integral IP (z)
gives another Stokes line arg z = − π
2 (3 − α).

A slight modiﬁcation is needed for the case β ∈ [1/5, 1/3), since φ0 = − π

2 (α−1) ∈ [−2π, −π)
in this case. Rotating the integration path clockwise and picking up the residue rN (z) =

obtained by substituting in u(t) = u(te2πi) + K(teπi)u(teπi); cf. (18). Now we focus on the
last integral. Making a change of variables t = e−πizτ α, and using the same optimal truncation
αN = ρ + r with ρ = |z|β, we obtain a slightly diﬀerent error term

also works for vβ. The reader is referred to [13, p.360] for full details.

To summarize, we have

Theorem 4. Assume that the functions uβ(z) and vβ(z), solving respectively (9) and (10),

6 Discussion

In the previous sections, we have determined a pair of new special functions uβ and vβ via
integral equations. Preliminary analysis reveals some of the analytic structures of the functions,
such as their analytic continuations, connection formulas, and asymptotic results involving
Stokes phenomenon. Still we have the following open problems.

Problem 1. Here we propose a thorough investigation of the analytic and asymptotic properties
of the functions uβ and vβ, such as their zeros, modulus function [11, §10.18], kernel [9], and
diﬀerential or diﬀerence equations, etc. For example, one may begin with

(i) Determine the coeﬃcients ck and dk of the expansion at inﬁnity given in (23), which are
now expressed in terms of uβ and vβ. It would be interesting and challenging to decode
the coeﬃcients from (9) and (10) in an explicit manner;

(ii) On account of (29), one may reasonably expect that the behaviors of uβ and vβ at the
˜dkzβk; see also Theorem 3 and Remark 1 for the
boundedness of these functions. A natural problem is to determine explicitly the coeﬃcients
˜ck and ˜dk, at least for k = 0 and 1.

origin are of the form Pk=0 ˜ckzk +Pk=1

The Stieltjes transform of the function K(t) given in (11) suggests that it would also be of

interest to study the related integral

for β > 0, deﬁned initially for arg z ∈ (−π, π) and then analytically continued to arg z ∈ R. The
special case when β = 2 is termed the Goodwin-Staton integral [11, (7.2.12)]; see also Jones [7],
where, by making use of the incomplete gamma function, asymptotic formulas are obtained for
a slightly more general integral.

The Mittag-Leﬄer function can be represented in terms of this function. For α = 1/β > 0,

the Mittag-Leﬄer function is given by

(27)

where Zk = zβe2πikβ for integer k and the summation is taken over all k satisfying | arg Zk| < π.
The path C is a Hankel contour, and dented properly if | arg Zk| = π for a certain integer k; cf.
[13].

As in Wong and Zhao [13], it is appropriate to divide our discussion into several cases: (i) α
is a positive integer, (ii) α ∈ (2l − 1, 2l), l = 1, 2, 3, · · · , and (iii) α ∈ (2l, 2l + 1), l = 0, 1, 2, · · · .
In case (i), i.e., when α is a positive integer, the contour integral in (27) vanishes; thus the

function Eα(z) is an elementary function. In case (ii), we have

I(z) =

β
2πi

Gβ(e(2l−1−α)πiz) −

β
2πi

Gβ(e(α−2l+1)πiz)

initially for arg z = 0, and then extend the region of validity by analytic continuation. Similarly,
in case (iii),

I(z) =

β
2πi

Gβ(e(2l+1−α)πiz) −

β
2πi

Gβ(e(α−2l−1)πiz).

Asymptotic expansions of Gβ can be derived as follows. For example, at inﬁnity, we have

Gβ(z) ∼

(−1)n−1Γ(n/β)

Xn=1

(28)

initially for | arg z| < π. The region of validity can be extended to | arg z| < π + π

see [11, (6.2.1), (6.2.3)-(6.2.4)], γ being Euler’s constant. It can be shown that the expansion
in (29) is valid in the sector | arg z| < π + π

2β , as long as β is a positive irrational number.

If β > 0 is a rational number, then we write β = p/q with p and q being relatively prime.

(31)

The change of variable t1/q = s gives

Gβ(z) =Z ∞

sq + ζ q dζ, ζ q = z.

Let ωl = e(2l+1)πi/q, l = 0, 1, · · · , q − 1. Since

sq + ζ q = (s − ω0ζ)(s − ω1ζ) · · · (s − ωq−1ζ),

taking logarithmic derivative yields

qsq−1
sq + ζ q =

Thus, Gβ(z) in (31) can be written as

Gβ(z) =

Xl=0

Gp(cid:16)e(2l+1−q)πi/qζ(cid:17) .

The problem is now reduced to consider the function Gp(z), where p is a positive integer. In
this case, the integral for Gp(z) can again be broken into two parts, one over the interval (0, 1)
and the other on the inﬁnite interval (1, ∞). The integral on (1, ∞) can be asymptotically
evaluated as before. For the integral on (0, 1), we expand the exponential function e−tp
into a
power series. This leads to inﬁnitely many integrals of the form

In(z) =Z 1

Asymptotic expansion of Gp(z) can thus be obtained for small values of z.

Problem 2. We have used numerical simulation to draw the graphs of uβ(x) for various values
β ∈ (0, 1); see Figure 1. From the graphs, it is reasonable to conjecture that the function uβ(x)
is monotonically decreasing in x ∈ [0, ∞), and also that the initial value uβ(0) is decreasing in
β ∈ (0, 1). What we need now are proofs of these statements. From Figure 1, corresponding
conjectures can be made for the function vβ(x).
