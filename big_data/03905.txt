Abstract

Binary systems with neutron stars and double degenerate systems are crucial objects to test
current stellar evolution models and Einstein’s general relativity. In this study, we present angu-
lar momentum loss mechanism via gravitational radiation and magnetized stellar winds for some
selected systems with a neutron star. We calculated and plotted their time scales for angular mo-
mentum loss. Gravitational wave amplitudes of binary systems with a neutron star components are
also estimated and their detectability with a gravitational wave detector (LISA) has been plotted.

Introduction

Massive stars are progenitors of supernovae. At the end of their evolution they leave behind either
neutron stars or black holes. Stars follow diﬀerent evolutionary stages up to this point of evolution
[1]. These diﬀerences are mainly because of the initial masses of stars; especially for single stars. In
binary stars, on the other hand, in addition to the initial mass; orbital period, mass ratio, and total
mass are crucial parameters that may aﬀect their evolution. Evolution of X-ray binaries consisting
of a compact object and a main-sequence star or a giant star depends strongly on the variation of
these parameters. X-ray binaries with low mass components are classiﬁed as LMXBs while binaries
with high mass components are classiﬁed as HMXBs. Parameters of many binary systems that are
members of LMXBs and HMXBs have been published in the literature. In this study, X-ray binary
systems consisting of a neutron star and a M/O star have been studied (NS+S). Both LMXB and
HMXB are considered.

2 Angular Momentum Loss in NS+S Systems

The binary systems presented in this study contain both early and late type components. Hence,
mass loss via stellar activity that is observed in late type stars and mass loss through strong stellar
wind, that is observed in early type stars, can be detected. In addition, mass transfer between the
components takes place. Mass loss/transfer is directly related to the angular momentum loss/transfer.
In main-sequence stars angular momentum loss mechanisms via stellar wind are important (see [2],
[3], [4]) while in cataclysmic variables and in other X-ray binaries mass loss via stellar activity and
angular momentum loss via gravitational radiation is important (see [5], [6] and references therein).

If the components are close to each other, in other words if the orbital period is short, angular
momentum loss via gravitational radiation might be important. General relativity predicts energy
loss because of the perturbation in space-time of binary stars, which releases gravitational waves [7].
Recently, gravitational waves are observed by LIGO team [8].

In this project, the orbital and physical parameters of 33 systems have been collected. Collecting
the parameters we carefully examined all the studies and selected the best observational results. The

orbital period vary from 0.2 to 1236 days. The mass of the components varies between 0.24 to 58 solar
masses. Some of the systems have late type components; therefore, in addition to angular momentum
loss via mass loss, angular momentum loss through gravitational radiation is also important. Angular
momentum loss via stellar winds and gravitational radiation has been studied previously by [4] and
the formulae are given in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). Yakut et al.
[4] calculated angular momentum loss
time scale via stellar wind and gravitational radiation (Eq. 1 and Eq. 2).

We have calculated angular momentum loss time scales for x-ray binaries with neutron star. We

plotted the results in Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b.

Observations of gravitational waves (Abbott et al. 2016) increased the importance of compact
binaries. Binary systems with neutron systems could be the progenitor of NS+NS or NS+BH systems
and most important candidates of gravitational-wave sources. K¨ose and Yakut [9] calculated the GW
amplitude (h) following the linearized Einstein ﬁeld equation (Eq. 3). We calculated h amplitude for
the collated NS+S systems and plotted them in Fig. (2).
