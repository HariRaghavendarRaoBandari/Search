Electronic nematicity, whereby electrons break rotational symmetry spontaneously, is a ubiquitous
property of the iron-based superconductors (Fe SC) [1]. As it is often accompanied by magnetic
order, an established route to nematicity is via critical magnetic ﬂuctuations [2]. However, this
mechanism has been questionned in FeSe, where the nematic transition occurs without magnetic
order, indicating a diﬀerent paradigm for nematicity [3–5, 8]. Here, we elucidate the nature of
nematicity in FeSe by using the unique ability of electronic Raman scattering to selectively probe
the dynamics of electronic nematic degrees of freedom free from lattice eﬀects [5–7, 7, 9, 11]. We
unravel the presence of critical charge nematic ﬂuctuations in the tetragonal phase which signals
the presence of a d-wave Pomeranchuk instability of the Fermi surface [13]. The extracted nematic
susceptibility shows quantitative scaling with the measured lattice softening [8, 10], demonstrating
that charge nematic ﬂuctuations account entirely for the lattice instability. Our results make a
strong case for pure charge driven nematicity in FeSe.

Despite its simple crystallographic structure, the iron-
chalcogenide FeSe displays remarkable properties. Its su-
perconducting transition temperature Tc is relatively low
at ambient pressure (∼9 K), but it reaches up to 37 K
upon applying hydrostatic pressure [15, 16]. Its Fermi en-
ergy is small [2, 18, 19], and in the normal state it shows
bad metal behavior [2, 20].
Its nematic properties are
peculiar as well. The lattice distortion, elastic softening
and elasto-resistvity measurements associated with the
structural transition at TS ∼ 90 K are comparable with
other Fe SC [3, 8, 18], yet Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) and inelastic neutron scattering measurements do
not detect sizable low energy spin ﬂuctuations above TS
[4, 8, 21], putting into question the spin nematic scenario
envisaged in other Fe SC [2]. While it has been argued
that the magnetic scenario may still apply [22–25], there
is growing interest in alternative scenario where charge
or orbital degrees of freedom play a more pre-dominant
role than spins [5, 18, 26]. However, until now direct
experimental observation of critical ﬂuctuations associ-
ated with electronic charge or orbital nematicity in the
tetragonal phase was lacking.

Being a symmetry resolved probe of the charge ﬂuctu-
ation dynamics with zero momentum transfer, electronic
Raman scattering is ideally suited to detect critical in
plane charge nematic ﬂuctuations [5, 7]. The symmetry
channel of the Raman response is ﬁxed by the directions
of the incoming and outgoing photon polarizations. Of
interest here is the B1g symmetry (using 1 Fe/cell nota-
tion), obtained for photons polarized along the diagonals
of the Fe-Fe bonds and which transforms as k2
y. The
B1g charge nematic ﬂuctuations probed by Raman are

x-k2

equivalent to a Fermi surface deformation with d-wave
symmetry. This electronic instability was predicted by
Pomeranchuk to occur in an isotropic Fermi liquid in
which the Fermi surface spontaneously deforms along a
speciﬁc direction, breaking rotational symmetry [13] (see
Fig. 1(a)).
In the context of Fe SC the B1g Raman
response probes the ﬂuctuations associated to a multi-
band version of a d-wave Pomeranchuk order parameter
which breaks the fourfold symmetry axis (Fig. 1(b)):

Raman scattering experiments were performed on two
diﬀerent FeSe crystals (SP208 and MK, see Methods and
[1, 28]). Figure 1(c) displays the Raman response χ(cid:48)(cid:48)

diﬀerent symmetries µ as a function of temperature in
the tetragonal phase (T > TS) for SP208. For compari-
son besides the response in B1g symmetry, we also show
the response in B2g and A1g symmetries which trans-
form as kxky and k2
y respectively (see form factors
in the insets of Fig. 1(c)). Upon cooling the µ = B1g
Raman response displays an overall enhancement over a
wide energy range extending up to 2000 cm−1. At high
temperature the response is dominated by a broad peak,
centered around 400 cm−1 and whose weight increases
on cooling. In addition a relatively sharp peak emerges
below 100 cm−1: it softens and gains considerably in in-
tensity upon approaching TS (Fig. 1(d)). By contrast,
the response in the two other conﬁgurations is only mildly
temperature dependent. The B2g response shows a weak
suppression above 500 cm−1 and a build-up of spectral
weight between 200 and 250 cm−1, which likely origi-

deformations shown are consistent with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements in the orthorhombic

nates from an interband transition between nearly par-
allel spin-orbit split hole bands at the Γ point [18, 29].
Below TS the B1g response strongly reconstructs (Fig.
1(e)): the low energy response is suppressed and there
is a weak transfer of spectral weight at higher energy,
above 500 cm−1, in agreement with a previous Raman
study [30]. Below Tc superconducting gaps open on the
diﬀerent Fermi pockets (inset of Fig. 1(e)) giving rise to
two sharp peaks at 2∆=28 (±1) cm−1 (∼3.5 meV) and 37
(±2) cm−1 (∼4.6 meV), in broad agreement with Scan-
ning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) measurements [2].

Focusing on the tetragonal phase, we use the fact that
the Raman responses at ﬁnite frequency can be trans-
lated into their corresponding symmetry resolved charge
susceptibilities at zero-frequency using the Kramers-
Kronig relation,

χµ(T ) =

The susceptibilities obtained by integrating the ﬁnite fre-
quency responses up to Λ = 2000 cm−1 are shown as a
function of temperature in Fig. 2. While the B2g and
A1g susceptibilities are nearly T -independent, the B1g
susceptibility χB1g shows a strong enhancement with low-
ering temperature and subsequently collapses below TS.
This demonstrates the growth of charge nematic ﬂuctu-
ations in the tetragonal phase which are arrested by the
structural transition at TS. For both SP208 and MK
crystals the temperature dependence of χB1g above TS
is well captured by a Curie-Weiss law χB1g (T ) = B
,
T−T0
with a Curie-Weiss temperature T0 signiﬁcantly below
TS, namely 8 K and 20 K for SP208 and MK respec-
tively. Note that, the nematic susceptibility extracted
from the ﬁnite frequency spectra using Eq. (1) is in the
dynamical limit, i.e., χµ(T ) = limω→0 χµ(T, ω, q = 0).
In this limit the Raman response does not couple to the
soft orthorhombic acoustic phonon [9, 31], and T0 rep-
resents the bare charge nematic transition temperature

response in the tetragonal phase. As is evident from
the spectra close to TS in Fig. 1(a), the B1g response
is composed of two contributions, a sharp quasi-elastic
peak (QEP) at low energy (below 200 cm−1), and a
much broader peak centered around 400 cm−1. Both
features appear only in the B1g symmetry: χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
(ω) =
QEP (ω) + χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
b (ω). The low energy QEP is well repro-
duced by a damped Lorentzian χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
ω2+Γ2 ,
which allows a clear separation of the two contributions,
and the extraction of the broad χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
b (ω) close to TS (see
Fig. 4(a) and Supplements). As shown in Fig. 4(b),
their respective contributions A1(T ) and A2(T ) to the
nematic susceptibility χB1g (T ), through Eq. (1), have dif-
ferent behavior close to TS in the tetragonal phase. Only
the QEP contribution is critical, with A1(T )−1 extrap-
olating to zero close to T0. In contrast, the broad peak
contribution A2(T ), while sizable, increases only mildly
upon cooling. In addition, the extracted QEP line width
Γ(T ) shows a strong softening and extrapolates to zero
at ∼65 K (Fig. 4(c)).

B1g

In a weak coupling description of a d-wave Pomer-
anchuk instability, the QEP can be understood as the
standard Drude contribution to the Raman conductiv-
ity χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
(ω)/ω with weight A1 and width Γ that are
renormalized by the diverging nematic correlation length
ξ [6]. Deﬁning r0 ≡ ξ−2 ∝ (T − T0), this theory predicts
1 ∝ r0, and Γ ∝ Γ0r0, where Γ0 is a single particle
A−1
scattering rate. As shown in Fig. 4 (b) and (c), the linear
temperature dependencies of A−1
1 and Γ between TS and
TS+60 K are in agreement with the above expectation.

perature dependence of the B1g charge nematic susceptibility

photons. Also shown are data on SP208 using a diﬀerent ex-
citation energy (2.54 eV) and the susceptibility in the other
symmetry channels on SP208 (A1g and B2g). The lines are

that is unrenormalized by the lattice. Thus, the observed
Curie-Weiss behavior demonstrates the presence of a d-
wave Pomeranchuk instability of purely electronic origin
in FeSe. The d-wave Pomeranchuk order may explain the
peculiar k-dependent orbital splitting observed by angle
resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) below TS,
which does not ﬁt a simple ferro-orbital order [18, 28, 29].
Having established the presence of critical charge ne-
matic ﬂuctuations, we proceed to show that the struc-
tural instability at TS is entirely driven by the reported
charge nematic softening. The renormalization of the
relevant shear modulus CS due to the symmetry-allowed
coupling between TB1g and the orthorhombic strain of
the lattice is given by [6, 8]

CS(T ) = C 0

S − λ2χB1g (T ),

(2)

where λ is the electron-strain coupling constant. We take
C 0
S, the bare modulus, to be T -independent as expected
for a purely electronic driven structural transition thus
leaving λ as the only free parameter. As shown in Fig. 3,
we ﬁnd an excellent agreement between the observed soft-
ening of CS, obtained either directly from ultra-sound
measurements [10], or indirectly from Young’s modulus
measurements [8], and χB1g (T ) obtained from our Ra-
man measurements. Together with the absence of scal-
ing between elastic modulus and spin ﬂuctuations [8],
our result makes a strong case for a lattice distortion in
FeSe induced by a d-wave Pomeranchuk instability of the
Fermi surface.

Next, we discuss the frequency dependence of the B1g

However, the two quantities extrapolate to zero at diﬀer-
ent temperatures 20 K (± 10 K) and at 65 K (± 5 K)
respectively. We attribute this mismatch to a strong lin-
ear temperature dependence of the scattering rate Γ0(T ),
as suggested by resistivity measurements [1, 2] (see Sup-
plements).

Finally we discuss the microscopic origin of the broad
feature. It is unlikely to be from an Azlamazov-Larkin
type contribution of the ﬂuctuations of the stripe mag-
netic state [7, 9, 32] because, below TS, inelastic neutron
scattering and NMR data suggest an enhancement of low
energy spin ﬂuctuations [4, 8, 21], whereas we observe a
shift of spectral weight of χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
b (ω) to higher frequencies. It
is also unlikely that the feature is an interband transition,
since χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
b (ω) does not show any gap at low frequencies
above TS (see Supplements). One possibility is that it is
the nematic response of electrons that are not sharply de-
ﬁned quasiparticles. Such an interpretation would be in
line with the observed bad metal behavior [2, 20], and
the fact that the Fermi energy of FeSe is rather small
[2, 18, 19].

Overall, our ﬁndings reveal that the nematic transi-
tion of FeSe is due to an incipient d-wave Pomeranchuk
instability of the Fermi surface. This provides an alterna-
tive route to nematicity compared to the prevailing spin
ﬂuctuation mediated scenario that has been proposed for
other Fe SC. The subsequent challenge will be to iden-
tify the microscopic interaction that is responsible for the
Pomeranchuk instability, and to study if such an interac-
tion is relevant for other Fe SC as well.

Supplementary Information for ”Charge induced nematicity in FeSe”

I. METHODS

Single crystals of FeSe were grown using chemical vapor transport method based on the use of an eutectic mixture
of AlC3/KCl as described in [1, 2]. The two diﬀerent single crystals measured were grown in Grenoble (SP208) and
Kyoto (MK). The structural transition temperatures were determined in-situ by monitoring the emergence of Rayleigh
scattering by orthorhombic domains yielding TS=87 K and TS=88.5 K for SP208 and MK respectively (see below for
details). These values are in agreement with TS values extracted from transport measurement (see Fig. 13(a) and
[1, 2].) The superconducting transition temperatures Tc were measured using SQUID magnetometry giving Tc=8.5 K
(SP208) and Tc=9.1 K (MK). Again, these Tc values conﬁrm the values extracted from transport measurements (see
Fig. 13(a) and [1, 2]). The crystals were cleaved and transferred to a close-cycle cryostat in inert atmosphere to
prevent surface degradation.
Polarization-resolved Raman experiments have been carried out using a diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) laser
emitting at 2.33 eV. For low energy (< 500 cm−1) measurements a triple grating spectrometer equipped with
1800 grooves/mm gratings and a nitrogen cooled CCD camera were used. Measurements at higher energies, up
to 2000 cm−1, were performed using a single grating spectrometer with 600 grooves/mm in combination with an
ultra-steep edge ﬁlter (Semrock) to block the stray-light. Additional measurements were also performed using the
2.54 eV line of an Ar-Kr Laser. The laser spot dimension was ∼ 50x80 µm2. The typical laser power used was 8 mW,
but for spectra in the superconducting state laser power less than 0.2 mW was used. All temperatures were corrected
for the estimated laser heating (see below for details).

The B1g and B2g symmetries were obtained using perpendicular incoming and outgoing photon polarizations at 45
degrees, and along of the Fe-Fe bonds respectively. When using parallel incoming and outgoing photon polarizations
at 45 degrees of the Fe-Fe bonds, A1g + B2g symmetries are probed. The A1g component can be isolated from the
A1g+B2g spectra by subtracting the B2g contribution obtained independently. A piezo-rotator was used to change
the orientation of the crystal in-situ with respect to the photon polarizations.
In order to extract the symmetry
dependent nematic susceptibility from the Raman response at ﬁnite frequency using Kramers-Kronig relation, the
responses were extrapolated linearly from the lowest frequency measured (8 - 9 cm−1 depending on the symmetry
and sample) to zero frequency.

II. LASER HEATING AND DETERMINATION OF TS

A clear manifestation of the structural transition is the appearance of Rayleigh scattering at the surface of the
crystal due to twin domains formation at TS. This eﬀect is easy to monitor using a camera to visualize the laser spot
during Raman experiments. Moreover, it is very useful to estimate the actual value of TS, as well as laser heating
in-situ.

To achieve this, we take pictures of the laser spot at diﬀerent temperatures for a given value of laser power PL (see

ﬁgure 5), then integrate out the whole spot intensity and plot it as a function of temperature (see ﬁgure 6).

FIG. 5: Images of the laser spot at diﬀerent temperatures, taken on an SP208 sample, for a laser power of 0.5 mW.

Figure 5 shows images of the laser spot taken at diﬀerent temperatures on the SP208 sample, for a laser power of
0.5 mW. These images show the onset of twin domains scattering at a temperature TDS between 87.5 K and 87.0 K.
Since twin domains scattering appears when the eﬀective temperature equals TS, the onset temperature TDS depends
on the value of laser heating.

FIG. 6: Integrated laser spot image intensity as a function of temperature, for sample SP208, at a laser power of 0.5 mW.

Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of the integrated intensity on SP208 at a laser power of 0.5 mW.
It shows an order parameter-like behaviour, which extrapolates at a temperature T oﬀ
DS,1 = 86.5 K. Note that the
integrated intensity starts to be non-zero at a temperature slightly above T on
DS,1 = 87.5 K. This behavior may be due
to either the gaussian tail of the laser spot, for which the actual laser heating is lower than that measured at the
center of the laser spot, or to a slightly inhomogeneous distribution of TS.

The same measurement was also performed for a higher laser power of 5 mW. The order parameter ﬁt gives
DS,2 = 82.6 K. Assuming the following linear relation between the three quantities TS, T oﬀ
T oﬀ

DS and HL(TS) :

TS = T oﬀ

DS + HL(TS) × PL

we can thus determine the actual TS of our sample and the laser heating at transition HL(TS). We deduce from

our two measurements :

{ T S = 86.9 ± 0.4 KHL(TS) = 0.9 K/mW

The same procedure was applied to sample MK yielding, within error bars, the same estimation of laser heating,
but a slightly higher TS: TS=88.5 ±0.5 K. Knowing these quantities and the temperature dependence of thermal
conductivity κ(T ), we can compute an estimation of laser heating as a function of temperature HL(T ) using the
method described in ref [3].

III. COMPARISON WITH CO-BA122

While there is an apparent contrast between FeSe and other Fe SC with respect to spin degrees of freedom we
show in ﬁgure 7(a) that, when plotted as a function of T -T0, the temperature dependence of the charge nematic
susceptibility of FeSe is remarkably similar to the one of electron doped Co-Ba122 [5]. However the two systems diﬀer
in the magnitude of the splitting between TS and T0, which in a simple Landau-type picture measures the strength
of the electron-lattice coupling [4]. The splitting is 70-80 K for FeSe while it is less than 60 K in Co-Ba122 (40 K for
undoped Ba122) indicating a larger electron-lattice coupling energy in FeSe (Fig. 7(b)).

IV. LINK BETWEEN CS, Y[110] AND NEMATIC SUSCEPTIBILITY

Here we give details on the link between the Raman charge nematic susceptibility, the shear modulus and Young’s

modulus along the [110] direction, as measured in 3-point bending measurements [8].

A. Link between CS and Y[110]

According to elasticity theory Y[110] can be expressed as a function of the components of the elastic tensor as:

Y[110] = 4[

1
CS

+

]−1

1
γ

(3)

Using the Voigt notation and the tetragonal (2 Fe) unit cell, the shear modulus is given by CS=C66. The coeﬃcient
γ depends on four other components: γ = C11
. As in all Fe SC, CS is the only soft component above TS.
The other components have a weak temperature dependence due to anharmonicity and can be safely approximated as
constants between 300K and TS [9, 10]. Suﬃciently close to TS the behavior of Y[110] will therefore be dominated by
CS which strongly softens: Y[110]
. However this approximation holds only very close TS, and far away from TS
the proportionality between the 2 quantities will not be veriﬁed. This can be illustrated by assuming that CS follows
a Curie-Weiss dependence as observed in Co-Ba122:

TS is the structural transition temperature and T0 can be thought as the electronic nematic transition temperature
in the absence of coupling to the lattice. T0 can be identiﬁed as the Curie-Weiss temperature extracted from Raman
measurements if only charge and lattice degrees of freedom are considered.
It is straightforward to compute the
corresponding temperature dependence of Y[110]:

The temperature dependence of Y[110] is still of Curie-Weiss type but with a new characteristic temperature T1 (cid:54)= T0.

and α ≈=1.5 in FeSe. In general T1 will be bounded by T0 from below, and TS from above: T0 < T1 < TS. The
disagreement between CS and its estimate from Y[110] will therefore be marginal when T0 and TS are close like in
Ba122 (about 40 K). However in FeSe where TS − T0 ∼ 70 K the diﬀerence is more signiﬁcant, and the full expression
3 must be used. This is illustrated in ﬁg. 8 (a) and (b) where the normalized temperature dependences of CS and
Y[110] are plotted for parameters relevant to Ba122 and FeSe respectively.

B. Simultaneous scaling of CS and Y[110] with χB1g

The comparison between the experimentally observed softening of Cs and the one expected from the charge nematic
susceptibility χB1g was performed using equation 2 of the main text with C 0
s =105 (110) GPa for SP208 (MK) sample.
The only free parameter was the electron-lattice coupling λ and good agreement was found for each sample in the
temperature interval where CS was measured. The λ value used for SP208 was 10% higher than for MK. Note that
since χB1g extracted from Raman measurements is only known in relative units, we cannot access the absolute value
of λ from the ﬁts. Using the same parameters, C 0
S and λ, the associated softening of Y[110] was then computed using
equation 3 with γ=70 GPa, as estimated from both elastic constant measurements and ab-initio calculations [10, 11].
As Y[110] is only known up to a constant prefactor, the data were rescaled at 250 K [8].

A. Fits using a quasi-elastic peak and a low energy background

In order to quantify the temperature dependences of the two components contributing to nematic ﬂuctuations in
FeSe, it is necessary to ﬁt Raman response data, especially the low-energy Quasi-Elastic Peak (QEP). To achieve this,
we used the following general expression :

10

where the QEP is modeled by an damped Lorentzian:

(cid:48)(cid:48)

χ

(ω, T ) = χ

(cid:48)(cid:48)

QEP(ω, T ) + χ(cid:48)(cid:48)

b (ω, T )

(cid:48)(cid:48)
χ
QEP(ω, T ) = A1(T )

Γ(T )ω

ω2 + Γ2(T )

(7)

(8)

At low energy the broad peak χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
guaranty causality.

b was modeled using a third order polynomial form with only odd powers in ω to

χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
b (ω, T ) = b1(T )ω + b3(T )ω3

(9)

As is clear from ﬁgure 4(a) of the main text and from ﬁgures 10(a) and 11(a), equation (7) ﬁts well the Raman
response data at low energy, up to at least 180 cm−1, and at all temperatures, above and below TS. In particular,
below TS, the high energy peak is partially gapped (see also ﬁgure 9), resulting in a change in parameter b3(T ) from
negative values above TS to positive values deep below TS.

Figures 4(b) of the main text and 10(b) and 11(b) show the temperature dependences of the inverse of the two
contributions to the nematic susceptibility, A1 and A2. The temperature dependences A1(T ) for all samples were
ﬁtted between 95 K and 150 K using a linear form A1(T ) = a1.(T − T ∗). A2(T ) was computed using the following
method : the low energy QEP ﬁts were subtracted from the full Raman responses (Fig. 9). The spectra were then
divided by frequency and integrated up to 2000 cm−1.

Figures 4(c) of the main text and 10(c) and 11(c) show the temperature dependences of the line width Γ of the
QEP, directly extracted from ﬁts of the Raman response using equation (7). The temperature dependences Γ(T ) were
ﬁtted between 95 K and 150 K using a linear form Γ(T ) = Γ0(T − T ∗∗).

B. Fits using two quasi-elastic peaks

As shown in ﬁgure 12(a), we found that the data can also be well ﬁtted above TS with a sum of two QEPs, as

expected from the contributions of two intraband, Drude-like, terms:

more incoherent intraband excitations. Note however, that because of the partial gapping mentioned above, the two

of the inverse of the two contributions to the nematic susceptibility, A1 and A2 extracted from the ﬁts. Figure 12(c)
shows the temperature dependences of the line widths Γ1 and Γ2 of QEP1 and QEP2, respectively. Both quantities
show linear temperature dependences, indicated by dashed and dotted lines, respectively.

VI. QEP LINE WIDTH AND RESISTIVITY

In a Random Phase Approximation picture of a d-wave Pomeranchuk transition we expect the QEP amplitude
1 (T ) to scale as r0(T ). Here r0(T ) = ξ−2 ∝ T − T0, where ξ(T ) is the nematic correlation length and T0 the mean-
A−1
1 (T ) (T ∗ ∼25 K
ﬁeld nematic transition temperature [6]. Experimentally T ∗, the zero temperature intercept of A−1
(± 15 K)), is indeed close to T0, as obtained from the global Curie-Weiss ﬁt of χB1g . However the zero temperature
intercept of the QEP line width Γ, T ∗∗, is signiﬁcantly higher: T ∗∗ ∼ 65 K (±5 K).
Here we show that the shift between T ∗ and T ∗∗ can be accounted by the temperature dependence of the bare
quasiparticle scattering Γ0(T ) as measured by e.g. transport. In FeSe, and in contrast to e.g. BaFe2As2, the resistivity
is strongly temperature dependent above TS. Between TS and 200 K it show quasi-linear behavior with a positive
intercept on the temperature axis. Since Γ(T ) ∝ Γ0(T) r0(T ), the temperature dependence of the QEP line width Γ
will contain contributions coming from both the quasiparticle scattering rate Γ0(T ) and r0(T ).
Assuming that Γ0(T ) is proportional to the resistivity, Γ0 ∝ R, we can extract the temperature dependence of

r0(T) by dividing the measurement of QEP line width Γ by the resistance R:

Γ(T )
R(T )

∝ r0(T )

(12)

We have used the resistivity data on a crystal from the same batch as SP208 (ﬁg. 13) to correct the temperature
dependence of Γ(T). Γ(T) and Γ(T )
R(T ) , normalized at their 160 K values, are shown in Fig. 13(b). While the temperature
dependence of Γ(T) between TS and 150 K extrapolates linearly at T ∗∗ ∼65 K, the quantity Γ(T )
R(T ) extrapolates at a
lower temperature ∼ 15 K, now much closer to the value of T ∗ extracted from the temperature dependence of QEP
amplitude A−1
1 . Taking into account the temperature dependence of the scattering rate Γ0(T ) thus reconciles the
temperature dependences of A1(T) and Γ(T).
