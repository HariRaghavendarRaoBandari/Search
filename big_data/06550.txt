We study the I -V characteristics of ST/n/N contacts, where ST is a BCS superconductor S with a built-in
exchange ﬁeld h, n represents a normal metal wire, and N—a normal metal reservoir. The superconductor ST
is separated from the n-wire by a spin ﬁlter which allows the passage of electrons with a certain spin direction
so that only fully polarized triplet Cooper pairs penetrate into the n-wire. We show that both the subgap
conductance σsg and the excess current Iexc, which occur in conventional S/n/N contacts due to Andreev
reﬂection (AR), exist also in the considered system. In our case, they are caused by unconventional AR that
is not accompanied by spin ﬂip. The excess current Iexc exists only if h exceeds a certain magnitude hc.
At h < hc the excess current is converted into a deﬁcit current Idef. The dependencies of the differential
conductance and the current Iexc are presented as a function of voltage and h.

INTRODUCTION.

As is well known, a so-called excess current Iexc appears
at large voltages V in Josephson junctions (JJ) with a di-
rect conductance,1,2 that is, the current Iexc arises in JJs of
the S/n/S or S/c/S types, where n denotes a normal metal
(a wire or a ﬁlm) and c—a constriction. This means that
the current-voltage (I -V ) characteristics at large V (eV ≫ ∆,
where ∆ is the energy gap in the superconductors S) has the
form

I (V ) = V /R + Iexcsgn(V ) ,

(1)

where R is the resistance of the JJ in the normal state and
the constant Iexc is the excess current which can be written
in the form

Iexc = a∆/R .

(2)

Here, a is a numerical factor equal to a = π2/4− 1 in the
diffusive limit,3 and a = 8/3 in ballistic JJs with ideal (fully
transparent) interfaces.4,5 Eq. (1) also describes the asymp-
totic behavior (eV ≫ ∆) of the I -V characteristics of S/n/N
contacts,4–6 where N is a normal metal reservoir.
In the
latter case, the excess current is twice smaller than in the
S/n/S JJs.

If the S/n or n/N interfaces are not ideal (the transmis-
sion coefﬁcient differs from 1), the coefﬁcient a in Eq. (2)
can be either positive or negative. That is, an excess Iexc or
deﬁcit Idef currents arise in this case. Their values depend
on the interface transparencies of both interfaces.7 The ap-
pearance of the excess current at large V as well as the non-
zero subgap conductance G(V, T ) of the S/n/N contacts at
V ≤ ∆/e and T = 0 is explained4–6 in terms of Andreev re-
ﬂections (AR).8 It has been shown in Refs. 4–6 that the zero
bias conductance G(0, 0) coincides with the conductance in
the normal state and has a non-monotonous dependence
on the applied voltage V or temperature T . Similar behav-
ior of the conductance takes place in the so-called Andreev
interferometers (see experimental observations in Refs. 9–
12 and theoretical explanations in Refs. 13 and 14).

The Andreev reﬂection implies that an electron moving in
the normal metal towards the superconductor is converted
at the S/n interface into a hole with opposite spin which
moves back along the same trajectory. Physically, this pro-
cess means that an electron with momentum p and spin s
moving from the n-metal penetrates the superconductor S
and forms there a Cooper pair, i.e., it pulls another elec-
tron with opposite momentum −p and spin −s. The ab-
sence of this electron in the n-metal is nothing else as the
creation of a hole with momentum −p and spin −s. In the
superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) contacts, the AR is sup-
pressed since the exchange ﬁeld h acting on spins breaks
the symmetry of spin directions. De Jong and Beenakker15
have shown that the conductance G(V, T )|V =T=0 in ballistic
S/F systems is reduced with increasing h and turns to zero
at h > EF, where EF is the Fermi energy. At high exchange
energy, electrons with only one spin direction exist in the
ferromagnet F so that the AR at S/F interfaces is not possi-
ble.

One can expect a similar behavior of the conductance
in ST/n/N contacts, where a “magnetic” superconductor
with a spin ﬁlter ST (see below) supplies only fully polar-
ized triplet Cooper pairs penetrating the n-metal. It consists
of an S/F bilayer and a spin ﬁlter Fl which passes electrons
with only one spin direction, so that one deals with the ST
superconductor constructed as a multylayer structure of the
type S/F/Fl. In this case, the conventional AR at the ST/n in-
terface is forbidden and, therefore, the subgap conductance
at low temperatures as well as the excess current may disap-
pear.

As will be shown in this work, the subgap conductance as
well as the excess current Iexc remain ﬁnite in ST/n/N con-
tacts. The magnitude of the current Iexc and its sign depend
on the value of the exchange ﬁeld in the ferromagnet F. In
the considered case of ST/n/N contacts, the subgap con-
ductance and the excess current occur due to an unconven-
tional AR in which two electrons with parallel spins in the
n-ﬁlm form a triplet Cooper pair with the same direction
of the total spin. Therefore, the AR at the ST/n interface is
not accompanied by spin-ﬂip (the hole in the n-wire has the

2

same spin direction as the incident electron).

Note that, nowadays, the interest in studies of the excess
current is revived in the light of recent measurements on
S/Sm/S JJs with unconventional semiconductor Sm (topo-
logical insulator) in which the Josephson effect can occur
due to Majorana modes (see recent experimental papers
Refs. 16 and 17, and references therein).
In these junc-
tions, the excess current also has been observed. On the
other hand, properties of high-Tc superconductors includ-
ing the iron-based pnictides have been also studied with the
aid of point-contact spectroscopy in which the differential
conductance of N/S point contacts has been measured.18–22
A theory of differential conductance of N/S point contacts
composed by a two band superconductor with energy gaps
of different signs [sgn(∆1) = −sgn(∆2)] has been presented
in Ref. 23.
In this Paper, we calculate the I -V characteristics of dif-
fusive superconductor/normal metal systems of two types.
In the ﬁrst type of contacts, Sm/n/N, the “magnetic” super-
conductor Sm is a singlet superconductor S covered by a thin
ferromagnetic layer [see Fig. 1 (a)]. In this case, both the sin-
glet and the triplet Cooper pairs penetrate into the n-wire.
In the second type of contacts, ST/n/N, the magnetic super-
conductor ST consists again of an S/F bilayer which is sepa-
rated from the n-wire by a spin ﬁlter Fl [see Fig. 1 (b)]. The
spin ﬁlter Fl is assumed to pass only electrons with spins ori-
ented along the z axis (s||ˆz). Using the quasiclassical theory,
we show that in both types of contacts, Sm/n/N and ST/n/N,
the conductance G is affected by the proximity effect and
the excess (deﬁcit) current Iexc (Idef) as well as the subgap
conductance are ﬁnite.

FIG. 1. (Color online.) Schematic representation of the system un-
der consideration. (a) Sm/n/N contact—the superconductor Sm
consists of a BCS superconductor S and a thin ferromagnetic layer
(denoted by Fw), and is connected to a normal metal reservoir N
on the right hand side via a normal metal wire n.
(b) ST/n/N
contact—in addition to the case (a), the Sm superconductor on
the left hand side is covered by a spin ﬁlter that passes electrons
only with a certain spin direction, say, parallel or antiparallel to
the z axis (indicated by the thick blue arrow). The superconduct-
ing phase on the left hand side is χL.

II. MODEL AND BASIC EQUATIONS

We consider an ST/n/N contact, in which the “magnetic”
superconductors are formed by a BCS superconductor S
(s-wave, singlet) covered by a thin ferromagnetic layer F
with an exchange ﬁeld h [see Fig. 1 (a)]. Due to proximity ef-
fect, the singlet component penetrates from the supercon-
ductor into the F ﬁlm, and also a triplet component arises
under the action of the exchange ﬁeld h. As is well known
(see reviews Refs. 24–27), in the case of homogeneous mag-
netization M (M||h) in the ferromagnet, the vector of the to-
tal spin of triplet Cooper pairs S lies in the plane perpendic-
ular to M. Thus, the S/F bilayer with a sufﬁciently transpar-
ent interface can be considered as a “magnetic” supercon-
ductor with a built-in exchange ﬁeld h that has the ampli-
tude heff = hdF/(dF + dS) and a nonzero projection onto the
z axis, where dF,S are the thicknesses of the F and S layers,
respectively.28 The F layer in ST/n/N contacts is separated
from the n-wire (or ﬁlm) by a ﬁlter that passes electrons only
with a certain spin direction, say, parallel or antiparallel to
the z axis [see Fig. 1 (b)]. As a ﬁlter, thin layers of strongly
polarized magnetic insulator29–31 and DyN or GdN ﬁlms32
can be used.

The convenient method to study the system un-
der consideration is the theory of quasiclassical Green’s

functions.33–36 This technique is generalized for the case of
ferromagnet-superconductor structures where a non-trivial
dependence of the quasiclassical Green’s functions ˇg on
spin indices must be taken into account.24,25,27 It has been
used in most papers for studying equilibrium properties,
e.g., the dc Josephson effect. In some papers, also the non-
stationary phenomena in S/F structures have been studied
(see the review Ref. 37 and references therein). In the con-
sidered non-equilibrium case, the Green’s function ˇg is a
matrix with diagonal matrix elements ( ˆg R and ˆg A) and non-
diagonal element ( ˆg K ), where the matrices ˆg R(A) and ˆg K
are the retarded (advanced) and Keldysh functions, respec-
tively. All these functions are 4× 4 matrices in the Gor’kov-
Nambu and spin spaces.

In the n-wire the matrix ˇg obeys an equation which looks

similar to the Usadel equation38 (see also Eq. (5) in Ref. 7)

∇( ˇg∇ ˇg )+ i κ2

ǫ[ ˆX30 , ˇg ] = 0,

(3)

where κ2
ǫ = ǫ/D with the diffusion coefﬁcient D. The ma-
trix ˆX30 = ˆτ3 · ˆσ0 is a tensor product of the Pauli matrices ˆτi
(i = 1, 2, 3) and the 2× 2 unit matrix ˆσ0, which operate in the
particle-hole and spin space, respectively. The matrix qua-
siclassical Green’s function ˇg obeys the normalization con-

dition

ˇg · ˇg = ˇ1.

(4)

Equation (3) is complemented by boundary conditions at
the interfaces Sm/n and n/N. They have the form [see
Eq. (4.7) in Ref. 39 and also Refs. 40–42]

2 ¯rSL ˇg ∂x ˇg = [ ˆΓ ˆG ˆΓ, ˇg ]|0 ,
2 ¯rNL ˇg ∂x ˇg = [ ˇg , ˆGN]|L .

(5)

(6)

Here, the sub-indices 0 and L relate to the n/Sm and n/N in-
terfaces, respectively, while ¯rS,N = σRS,N/L, where σ is the
conductivity of the n-wire, and RS,N denote the Sm/n (re-
spectively, n/N) interface resistance per unit area. The
matrix ˆΓ describes the electron transmission with a spin-
dependent probability T↑,↓. If the ﬁlters let to pass only elec-
trons with spins parallel to the z axis, then ˆΓ = T ˆ1+ U ˆX33
so that the probability for an electron with spin up (down)
to pass into the n-wire is T↑,↓ ∝ T ± U . We assume that
U = ζT with ζ = ±1, and the coefﬁcients T and U are nor-
p2. Note that coefﬁcients ¯rS,N are
malized, i.e., T = |U | =
inverted with respect to the coefﬁcients rν used in Refs. 43
and 44.

Consider ﬁrst Eq. (3) for the Keldysh Green’s function ˆg K .

In the considered one-dimensional case it has the form

∂x ( ˆg R ∂x ˆg K + ˆg K ∂x ˆg A)+ i κ2

ǫ [ ˆX30 , ˆg K ] = 0.

(7)

The Keldysh function ˆg K can be expressed in terms of the
retarded and advanced Green’s functions ˆg R(A), and the ma-
trix distribution function ˆn = nl ˆX00 + n ˆX30,

ˆg K = ˆg R · ˆn − ˆn · ˆg A .

(8)

The distribution function nl determines the superconduct-
ing order parameter ∆, whereas the function n describes the
dissipative current.45,46 We need to know only the distribu-
tion function n. Multiplying Eq. (7) by ˆX30 and taking trace
we obtain (employing the normalization condition Eq. (4),
in particular, the relations ˆg R(A) · ˆg R(A) = ˆ1)

Formula Eq. (11) generalizes Eq. (13) of Ref. 7 for the con-
sidered case of a spin-dependent interaction and can be ap-
plied to the description of contacts with a condensate con-
sisting of singlet and triplet Cooper pairs.
In the normal
state, above the critical temperature of the superconduc-
tor S, one has MN = MS = 2(1+ Mn) = 4. Thus, we obtain
a standard expression for the current per unit area in an
N/n/N contact

The denominator is the sum of interface resistances and the
resistance of the normal n-wire.

The normalized differential conductance of the contacts

under consideration ˜σd(v) ≡ (dI /dV )/σN at T = 0 is

( ¯rS + ¯rN + 1)/4

˜σd(v) =

¯rN/ML(eV )+ ¯rS/M0(eV )+(cid:173)(1+ Mn (x, eV ))−1®/2
(14)
where v = eV /∆ is the normalized voltage. The normal-
ized current ˜I (v) ≡ I (eV /∆)(L/σV ) is given by the relation
˜I (v) =Rv
0 ˜σd(v1)dv1 and, at large voltage, can be written in
the form

,

˜I (v) = ˜IN(v)+ δ ˜I (v) ,

(15)

where ˜IN(v) = v/(1+ ¯rS + ¯rN) is the normalized current
through the contact in the normal state. The normalized ex-
cess (δ ˜I = ˜Iexc) or deﬁcit current (δ ˜I = ˜Idef) is determined by
the expression

δ ˜I ≡ δ ˜I (∞) =Z∞

0

[ ˜σd(v)− 1] dv .

(16)

is a

where

0 σd(v1) dv1

˜I< =R1

It is valid at arbitrary temperatures because for the func-
tion FV in Eq. (11) we have FV → 1 for V → ∞.

The current ˜I (v) can be presented as ˜I (v) = ˜I< + ˜I>,
subgap current and
˜I> =Rv
1 σd(v1) dv1 is the contribution from quasiparti-
cles with energies above the gap; the normalized current in
the normal state is ˜IN(1) = (1+ ¯rS + ¯rN)−1.
We see that the excess current is determined by the re-
tarded (advanced) Green’s functions ˆg R(A) that obey an
Usadel-like equation. This equation can be solved in lim-
iting cases. We consider a contact with a shortn-wire

(L ≪ ξS ≃ pD/πTc) in which the interface resistances domi-
nate ( ¯rS,N ≫ 1), i.e., the interface resistances are much larger
than the resistance of the n-wire, RS,N ≫ L/σ.

A. Retarded (advanced) Green’s Functions

In the case of a short contact, the last term in the de-
nominator of Eq. (14) and the second term in Eq. (7) can be
neglected so that the Usadel equation for the Green’s func-
tions ˆg R(A) acquires the form

c. BCS-superconductor. For completeness, we con-
sider also the case of the BCS superconductor which is ob-
tained from the case of a “magnetic” superconductor Sm

B. General form of ˆg in case of large interface resistance

In order to make the results more transparent, we assume
that the parameter ¯rN/ ¯rS is small and both parameters ¯rN,S
are large ( ¯rN,S ≫ 1). These conditions correspond to exper-
imental systems and mean that the S/n interface resistance
is much larger than the resistance of the n/N interface and
both interface resistances are larger than the resistance of
the short n-wire. Then, the solution for a small correc-

siclassical retarded (advanced) Green’s functions in the sep-

tance of this interface due to quasiparticles with energies

the subgap conductance.

We analyze the differential conductance ˜σd(v) and the

I -V characteristics I (v),

I (v) =Zv

˜σd(v1) dv1 ,

(33)

for contacts of different types. Equations (30)–(33) allow one
to calculate the conductance and the I -V characteristics of
contacts under consideration.
In Fig. 2, we show the de-
pendence of the normalized differential conductance ˜σd(v)
on the normalized voltage v for the three types of con-
tacts, i.e., the Sm/n/N contact [Fig. 2 (a)], the ST/n/N con-
tact [Fig. 2 (b)], and the S/n/N contact, where S is a usual
BCS superconductor [Fig. 2 (c)]. Note that the dependence
˜σd(v) for the case of the BCS superconductor coincides with
that for the case of a “magnetic” superconductor if one sets
h = 0.
It is seen from Fig. 2 (c) that there is a nonzero subgap
conductance in the S/n/N contact. It is caused by a subgap
contribution related to the Andreev reﬂection. This mech-
anism is also responsible for a zero-bias peak in the con-
ductance that has been observed in early experiments on
S/n/Sm contacts (here, Sm is a n-doped semiconductor).47
Theoretical explanations for the observed subgap conduc-
tance is given in Refs. 7, 48, and 49.

In Figs. 2 (a) and 2 (b), we plot the voltage dependence of
the normalized conductance of the contacts of Sm/n/N and
ST/n/N types for different values of h. In both cases, the
subgap conductance is not zero, but it is small in contacts
of Sm/n/N type if the exchange ﬁeld h is small compared
to ∆. The latter property is due to a negligible contribution
to the conductance in the subgap region because this con-
tribution is provided by fully polarized triplet Cooper pairs
the density of which, FS−, decreases with decreasing h since
FS− ∝ h. Note that similar results (nonzero subgap conduc-
tance) were obtained in Ref. 50, where differential conduc-
tance of an F’/F/S structure has been studied. However, the
case of fully polarized triplet component has not been con-
sidered there.

The subgap conductance in another, although similar,
systems has been calculated in Ref. 51 on the basis of the
scattering matrix approach. The authors considered a half-
metal/ferromagnet/superconductor contact in the ballistic
regime assuming that the magnetizations in half-metal and
ferromagnet are not collinear. They assumed also that only
a single conducting channel exists in the system so that
the quasiclassical theory can not be applied to the system.
To some extent, the results obtained in our paper and in
Ref. 51 differ. Although the subgap conductance ˜σd(v) cal-
culated in Ref. 51 differs from zero, it turns to zero at v = 0
whereas ˜σd(0, h) obtained by us in the present work is ﬁnite.
A similar system consisting of a half-metallic ferromag-
net and a superconductor has been studied in Refs. 52 and

ing zero-bias conductance for T → 0.
In our case, the ﬁ-
nite ˜σd(0, h) is caused by unconventional Andreev reﬂection
of triplet Cooper pairs induced in the n-wire due to proxim-
ity effect. This AR make the Sm/n interface partially trans-
parent as it occurs in S/n contacts,7,47–49.

The zero-bias conductance ˜σd(0, h) as a function of h is
depicted in Fig. 3 for the Sm/n/N and ST/n/N contacts. It
is equal to zero at h = 0 in the ST/n/N contact, where only
triplet Cooper pairs are present, and has a maximum at
h = ∆. As mentioned above, at h = 0 the amplitude of the
triplet component turns to zero, and hence the zero-bias
conductance vanishes.

B. Excess or deﬁcit current

We investigate the I -V characteristics of the contacts of

the types Sm/n/N and ST/n/N.

a.

Sm/n/N contact.

In the considered case of small γ,
the I -V characteristics shows an excess current. In partic-
ular, for h = 0 we obtain ˜Iexc ∝ γ ln(2/γ) [or, with dimen-
sion, eIexc(RS + RN) ∝ ∆γ ln(2/γ) with γ = RN/RS]. The ex-
cess current increases with increasing the exchange ﬁeld h
[see Fig. 4 (a)]. The I -V curve has a simple form for the case
h = 0 (BCS superconductor). For small γ and Γ → 0, we ob-

Noticeably is the nonmonotonic behavior of the I -V curve in the
Sm/n/N contact. The excess current in the ST/n/N contact turns
to deﬁcit current at low h < hc (see text). The parameter γ has the
values γ = 0.1 (black solid lines), γ = 0.3 (blue dashed lines), γ = 0.5
(red dash-dotted lines), and γ = 0.7 (green dotted lines).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this case, there is an excess current in the I -V curve (see
Fig. 5).

b. ST/n/N contact. Using Eq. (16) we ﬁnd the excess or

deﬁcit current for small γ and h,

where c3/2 =R∞0 (1+ x3/2)−1dx ≈ 1.79. One can see that at
h > hc ≡ pγ£ ln(2/eγ)¤3/4
, there is an excess current and at
h < hc the excess current is converted into a deﬁcit current,
cf. Fig. 4 (b).

We studied transport properties of “magnetic” supercon-
ductor / normal metal point contacts of different types, in
which both the singlet and triplet Cooper pairs are present.
It is shown that, as it takes place in point S/n/N contacts
with BCS superconductor, the subgap conductance σsg and
the excess current Iexc are not zero even if only fully polar-
ized triplet component exists in the n-wire.
In this case,
the σsg and Iexc are caused by an unconventional Andreev
reﬂection without spin ﬂip; the hole moving back along the
trajectory of an incident electron with a spin S has the same
spin direction as S. A similar AR, equal-spin Andreev re-
ﬂection, has been studied in a recent paper,54 where a con-
tact between a ferromagnet and topological superconduc-

7

tor with Majorana modes has been considered.

We considered two types of contacts, namely the
Sm/n/N contacts, where both the singlet and triplet com-
ponent exist, and the ST/n/N contact, in which only fully
polarized triplet Cooper pairs penetrate into the n-wire. In
both types of contacts, the subgap conductance and the
excess current are present.
In the second type of con-
tacts, in ST/n/N, these are caused by an equal-spin AR.
With decreasing the magnitude of the exchange ﬁeld h
the excess current in the ST/n/N contact is transformed
into a deﬁcit current Idef. The systems considered by
us can be realized experimentally taking into account a

rapid progress in preparing S/F nanostructures of different
kinds.55–57 The obtained results can be used for identifying
the long-range triplet component and in future applications
in spintronics.58
