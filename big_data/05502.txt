We revisit the existing limits on the gaugino masses in various Supersymmetric
(SUSY) scenarios derived from Run-I data of the LHC. These limits obtained from the
various ﬁnal states rely heavily on the simpliﬁed assumptions regarding the masses,
compositions and decay branching ratios of the gauginos. The most promising exclusion
limits on the gaugino masses are obtained from trilepton ﬁnal states while the second

of these exclusion limits in more realistic scenarios. After a brief discussion on the

the ATLAS exclusion limits obtained from trilepton, lγγ and lb¯b ﬁnal states associated
with missing energy. We then consider diﬀerent combinations of the relevant branching
ratios to study their impact on the existing bounds. The results are presented alongside
the existing exclusion limits to showcase the extent of the obtained deviation. We also

√

After a long shutdown, the Large Hadron collider (LHC) is now operating in full swing at
a center of mass energy,
s = 13 TeV. In the aftermath of its huge success in terms of
the discovery of the elusive Higgs boson with mass around 125 GeV [1, 2] , the prime goal
of Run-II now is to look for new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). So far, after
analysing the Run-I data, ATLAS and CMS have only reported some small inconclusive
local excesses [3, 4] over the SM predictions, which need to be put under thorough scrutiny
at Run-II. Any of these excesses, if proven signiﬁcant, will open the window to the hitherto
√
unknown BSM physics. On the other hand, after just a few months of data accumulation at
s = 13 TeV, both CMS and ATLAS have hinted towards a possible scalar resonance at 750

2

GeV [5, 6] that has created a lot of buzz within the particle physics community. Although
promising, one has to wait for more data and ﬁner analyses to ascertain if this is indeed the
ﬁrst hint of the BSM physics we are so eagerly waiting for. At this stage, it is therefore
worthwhile to look back to our favourite new physics models and revisit the exclusion limits
derived from the existing experimental data. Supersymmetry (SUSY) [7–9], being one the
frontrunners among the BSM candidates, has been searched for extensively both by the
ATLAS and the CMS. The experimental results so far indicate towards a heavy coloured
sector (strongly interacting sector) within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric SM
(MSSM) [10–12]. ATLAS and CMS have already excluded ﬁrst two generation squarks and
gluino masses upto 1.7 TeV for degenerate squark-gluino scenario [10–12] 1 from Run-I data.
Depending upon the scenarios, the very recent Run-II data with an integrated luminosity
(L) = 3.2 fb−1, the limit on gluino and squarks has already been increased by 100 to 200
GeV [14, 15].

At the same time, exclusion limits on the masses of the electroweak sector sparticles,
namely, charginos, neutralinos 2 and sleptons, are much weaker because of their relatively
smaller production cross-sections at the LHC. The stringent limits on the coloured sector
sparticles make the search of the electroweakinos and the sleptons all the more important
from the perspective of SUSY searches at the 13 and 14 TeV run of the LHC. As the
ATLAS and the CMS collaborations have not yet published any new search results of the
electroweak sparticles from the very ﬁrst 13 TeV 3.2 fb−1 data, here we will only focus on
the Run-I data and the corresponding limits. From the combined data obtained at 7 TeV
and 8 TeV runs, the experimental collaborations have already put signiﬁcant mass limits
on the electroweakinos and the sleptons from direct search channels [16–22] that include
chargino - neutralino, chargino pair and slepton pair productions. However, the existing
bounds apply only for some simpliﬁed SUSY scenarios which assume a certain hierarchy
between the slepton and the gaugino masses and also ﬁx their compositions. In the studies

These assumptions have crucial impact on the relevant production cross-section and decay
branching ratio (BR) of the concerned sparticle and as a result, the existing bounds are
expected to change signiﬁcantly in more realistic scenarios.

A number of phenomenological studies already exist which have analysed the implications of
electroweakino searches and related topics at the LHC [23–26]. In a recent work [25] it has
been shown that the LHC constraints in the trilepton channel are signiﬁcantly weaker even in

with non-negligible higgsino component) Br( ˜χ0

quence reduces the signal signiﬁcance of the trilepton ﬁnal states. Even for wino-dominated

1Z/h result in various leptonic ﬁnal states
associated with b-jets or photons and E/T. ATLAS collaboration has recently presented the
electroweakino search results with 1l + 2b and 1l + 2γ ﬁnal states [19]. However, the limits
are derived on the gaugino mass plane assuming 100% branching ratio into one particular
decay mode, which does not provide us with the whole picture. The interplay between the
1) can also modify the exclusion limits
considerably in more realistic situations, e.g., phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM) [27]. It
is, therefore, worthwhile to revisit the existing limits with diﬀerent compositions and mass
hierarchies of the gauginos. Moreover, the oﬀ-shell production and subsequent decays of the
1 decays can result in a wide range of possible decay
BRs. These oﬀ-shell decay modes, if taken into account, can also give rise to similar ﬁnal
states as obtained from the two-body decay modes of the gauginos. All these possibilities
need to be explored in the light of the data accumulated from run-I before embarking to the
run-II of the LHC.

A light gaugino and (or) slepton scenario is also highly motivated from the observed
excess of anomalous magnetic moment of muon ((g − 2)µ) measurements and existence of
Dark Matter (DM). In order to ﬁt the excess in (g − 2)µ [28] over the SM predictions
within the framework of MSSM, requires the slepton and the lighter chargino masses in the
few hundreds of GeV range [24, 25, 29]. Various leptonic ﬁnal states associated with large
missing energy are the favoured channels to look for such a scenario. A heavy coloured
sector, as favoured by the LHC data, ﬁts more naturally for such MSSM parameter space as
their contributions to the cascade of the gauginos from even oﬀ-shell productions are small in

that case resulting in larger branching ratios to the leptonic ﬁnal states resulting in cleaner
1) is stable and can
be a good candidate for the elusive dark matter (DM) [30–32] in the universe. A partial list
of works on supersymmetric DM may be seen in Ref. [33–37]. The electroweak sparticles may
also lead to correct relic density for DM via the DM annihilation/coannihilation mechanisms.
This way the electroweak sector can also be constrained from the precisely measured value
of DM relic density by WMAP [38] or PLANCK [39].

In this present study, we assume that the sleptons are heavier than the electroweakinos,
but not so heavy that they may be considered to be decoupled. The entire coloured sector,
on the other hand, is decoupled from the rest of the SUSY spectrum. Apart from the obvious
advantages of having light sleptons in the theory from the viewpoint of (g − 2)µ and DM,
such scenarios may result in signiﬁcant enhancement of the three body branching ratios of
the electroweakinos from the oﬀ-shell decays of the sleptons. Such oﬀ-shell slepton decays
in this context of the gauginos have not been studied by the experimental collaborations so
far.

The paper is organised in the following way. First, we explore the available parameter
space in pMSSM through a detailed scan using the constraints derived from the most updated

collider and ﬂavour physics data. In Sec. 2 we discuss about the various decay modes of (cid:101)χ0

of muon g-2 and DM relic density on the available parameter space. In Sec. 3, we study
1 and their subsequent decays resulting in various ﬁnal
states following the footsteps of the corresponding ATLAS analyses for validation. Then we
proceed with the same scenarios with diﬀerent values of the 2-body and 3-body branching

imposed by the ATLAS analyses. We ﬁnally provide our conclusions in Sec. 4.

may give rise to similar ﬁnal states. Therefore, in order to obtain a clear idea of the variation
1 over the pMSSM parameter space, we scan the relevant

2 and(cid:101)χ±

parameters in the following ranges:

1 GeV < M1 < 1200 GeV,

100 GeV < M2 < 1500 GeV,

100 GeV < µ < 2000 GeV

1 < tan β < 50,

100 GeV < MlL < 2000 GeV,

100 GeV < MlR < 2000 GeV,

where, M1, M2 and µ are the bino, wino and higgsino soft mass parameters respectively.
tan β is the ratio of the up-type and down-type Higgs vacuum expectation values. MlL and
MlR denote the left and right-handed slepton soft masses respectively. We assume equal soft
masses for all three generations sleptons. The gluino and the squark sector particles have no
impact in our present study. Hence we decouple these particles from the rest of the spectrum
and keep their soft mass parameters at 3 TeV. For this scan we have used SUSPECT [40]
and SUSY-HIT [41] to calculate the SUSY spectrum and the relevant branching ratios. The
ﬂavour and other low energy constraints have been calculated using micrOMEGAs [42].
While scanning we ensure that for all the points M1 < M2 < µ, so that the LSP is always
mostly bino-like. However, since M1, M2 and µ have all been varied independent of each
other, the LSP may as well be a bino-wino or bino-wino-higgsino mixed state. We also make

the three body decay modes of the electroweakinos may have large enough branching ratios
which can not be ignored. We discuss more about this later in this section. The following
experimental constraints have been taken into account while scanning:

• The lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass should be in the range 125 ±3 GeV [1, 2]

considering a theoretical uncertainty of 3 GeV [43].

• Lighter chargino ((cid:101)χ±

1 ) mass should be above LEP exclusion limit, i.e, 103.5 GeV [44].

• We impose the ﬂavour physics constraints:

2.82 × 10−4 < BR(b → sγ) < 4.04 × 10−4 (at 2σ level) [45] and
1.57 × 10−9 < BR(Bs → µ+µ−) < 4.63 × 10−9 (at 2σ level) [45].

tion, the exclusion limit is relatively weaker than the degenerate case (see Fig. 8 of

but the L-type sleptons can have signiﬁcant branching ratio in the additional decay
2 which have not been considered by the LHC collaborations.
In such scenarios, limits on the slepton (L-type) masses can change from the exist-
ing limits. A detailed computation of these revised limits is beyond the scope of this
work. Instead, we have implemented the bounds on the slepton masses conservatively
in a bin-by-bin basis separately for L-type and R-type sleptons derived from Fig. 8 of
Ref. [17] depending on various slepton and LSP mass regions.

Naturally, we obtain highest BR for the τ ¯τ ﬁnal state, stau being the lightest slepton. As
2 mass diﬀerence keeps increasing, contributions from oﬀ-shell sleptons start
to diminish and that from oﬀ-shell Z-boson start to dominate. The Z-boson, despite being
much lighter than the sleptons, only starts to aﬀect the BRs in cases where the slepton
2 has very small or no higgsino components at
all and hence their coupling to Z-boson is usually suppressed. Contribution of the oﬀ-shell
Higgs boson state is small due to its small coupling with the SM leptons. The orange (trian-

points correspond to a mass diﬀerence > 750. Looking at the values of the BRs from the
plots it can be easily understood that once the mass diﬀerence becomes greater than 500
GeV, the three body decays are entirely controlled by oﬀ-shell Z-decays.

2.3 (g − 2)µ and Dark Matter

Existence of DM and the experimentally observed [28] excess in the muon anomalous mag-
netic moment over the SM prediction [46–48] remain two of the most robust hints towards
BSM physics. The BSM contribution to muon anomalous magnetic moment (deﬁned as
∆aµ) has to ﬁt within the deviation ∆aµ = (29.3± 9.0)× 10−10 [46]. Eﬀorts have been made
to explain this excess in the context of various BSM models [24, 25, 29, 49–51]. Within the
framework of the MSSM, small slepton and gaugino masses are favoured in order to enhance
∆aµ to the desired range. Thus part of our parameter space is quite relevant from the angle
of this anomalous experimental result. In general, most of the SUSY contribution to ∆aµ
arises from the chargino-sneutrino loop. However, the neutralino-smuon loop can also pro-
vide signiﬁcant enhancement depending on the choices of left and right-handed smuon mass
parameters. In this section, we use the 1σ, 2σ and 3σ allowed ranges of ∆aµ in order to
constrain our parameter space further.

candidate [24, 25, 29, 33–37]. For such a light electroweak sector and bino-like DM, correct
relic density may be obtained via its self-annihilation, bulk annihilation with sleptons (mostly
2) having mass close to
. For a compressed electroweak sector, combined eﬀect of all these annihilation processes
often may lead to underabundance of the DM candidate. However, a multi-component DM
is an equally plausible scenario [52–60]. A bino-like DM is also safe from the direct-detection
constraint as long as the µ-parameter remains relatively large resulting in negligible higgsino
components in its composition. Since the focus of our work is more on the collider aspects
of the electroweak sector, rather than the DM properties, we shall not discuss about these

2.4 Benchmark Points

Based on our discussion so far, we have selected a few benchmark points presented in Table. 1
below. BP1, BP2 and BP3 represent part of the parameter space where two-body decay
modes of the electroweakinos are forbidden whereas BP4, BP5 and BP6 represent that where
the two-body decays are allowed. Diﬀerent choices of M1, M2, MlL and MlR are considered
to highlight their eﬀect on the relevant branching ratios and the experimental constraints.
For all these benchmark points, squark soft-mass parameters are kept ﬁxed at 3 TeV and a
large At (4 TeV) is considered in order to ﬁt the SM-like Higgs mass constraint. BP1 and
BP2 results in a ∆aµ that lie within its 2σ allowed range. This is mainly because of their
light chargino and left-smuon mass. It is hard to achieve this kind of enhancement in ∆aµ
once the MlL parameter starts to increase. This feature can be clearly seen from BP3 and
BP5.

BP1 has a large mixing between the bino and wino components. As a result, the (cid:101)χ0

for trilepton ﬁnal states with or without τ -tagging [16, 22]. For Wh mediated simpliﬁed

they have looked for ﬁnal states consisting of an isolated electron or muon with
large E/T associated with any one of the three following possibilities: two b-tagged jets (lb¯b
channel), two photons (lγγ channel) or a second electron or muon of similar electric charge
(l±l± channel) [19]. Also ATLAS has presented mass limits on m(cid:101)χ±
considering
h → τ τ, W W, ZZ decay modes contributing to trilepton ﬁnal states: 3l (l = e, µ) + 0τ ,
2l+ 1τ , 1l + 2τ [16]. Below we brieﬂy discuss about these search analyses [16, 19] used by
ATLAS and present our results alongside theirs for validation. Note that, in this work, we

3.1 Search for Trilepton ﬁnal states

pMSSM scenarios but with ﬁxed values of LSP masses [16]. For validation purpose, we only

look into the (cid:101)(cid:96)L- and W Z-mediated simpliﬁed models. In (cid:101)(cid:96)L-mediated models, left handed

Events are selected with exactly three tagged leptons (electron, muon or tau) with the
requirement that one of these tagged leptons must be either electron or muon5. Event re-
construction details like electron, muon, tau and jet identiﬁcation, isolation, overlap removal
etc. are followed according to the ATLAS analysis as mentioned in Sec. 5 of [16]. In this
trilepton analysis, a veto on b-jet is applied to all signal channels. For b-jets, we use the
pT dependent b-tagging eﬃciencies obtained by ATLAS collaboration in Ref. [61]. For τ -jet
identiﬁcation, we only use the hadronic decay modes. We demand that the candidate jets
must have pT > 20 GeV and lie within |η| < 2.5. We also demand that these candidate jets
must contain one or three charged tracks with |ηtrack| < 2.5 and highest track must have
pT > 3 GeV. Moreover, in order to ensure proper charge track isolation, we put a veto on
any other charged tracks with pT > 1 GeV inside the candidate jet.

because of their less signiﬁcant results in terms of exclusion limits.

regions (SR), namely, SR0τ a, SR0τ b, SR1τ , SR2τ a, SR2τ b. For implementation of all these
signal regions we follow the selection requirements as described in Table 3 and Table 4 of
Ref. [16]. Lack of any BSM signal so far in all these channels have resulted in exclusion
limits presented at the 95% conﬁdence level (CL), on the number of BSM signal events,
NBSM , for each of the signal regions (SR). These upper limits are presented in Table 7 and
Table 8 of Ref [16]. The ATLAS collaboration has translated these obtained upper limits
In a similar way, we also have
reproduced the exclusion contours obtained by ATLAS assuming similar mass relations and
branching ratios of the relevant gauginos and sleptons. Note that we have also validated the
cut-eﬃciency table provided by ATLAS. In order to validate our results we reproduce the
exclusion contours using PYTHIA (v6.428) [62]. We also compute the next to leading order

We observed that for slepton, W Z or W h mediated simpliﬁed models, SR0τ a and SR0τ b
are the most sensitive channels to provide the exclusion limits. Henceforth we will not discuss
about the rest of the three signal regions. Depending upon the invariant mass of same-ﬂavour
opposite-sign (SFOS) lepton pair (mSF OS), which lies closest to the Z boson mass, SR0τ a
signal regions are sliced into ﬁve bins and each mSF OS slice is further divided into four bins
according to the values of E/T and transverse mass, mT . Here, mT is constructed with the

3.2 Search for ﬁnal states with Higgs

For Wh mediated simpliﬁed models, where the (cid:101)χ0

2 decays into the SM-like Higgs boson and
the LSP, ATLAS has very recently presented their results in two new channels [19]. Along
with large E/T and an isolated lepton (electron or muon), they have looked for either two
b-jets or two photons originating from the 125 GeV Higgs. Here we have considered these
two decay modes of the SM-like Higgs since h → b¯b has the largest branching ratio of all
the decay modes of h and although the BR(h → γγ) is usually very small, the large photon
detection eﬃciency makes this decay mode one of the most viable ones in collider studies.
We ignore the possible dilepton ﬁnal state as mentioned in the last section, since it gives the
weakest limit on the gaugino masses. We now discuss about our validation results in these
two channels.

3.2.1 One lepton and two b-jets channel

In this channel, the events are selected with exactly one lepton with pT > 25 GeV. We also
implement all the isolation criteria used by ATLAS to improve the purity of the reconstructed
objects and the overlap removal procedure between lepton-lepton or lepton-jets summarised
in Table 2 of of Ref [19]. In addition to the charged lepton, the events must contain two or

to this ﬁnal state are expected to arise from t¯t, W + jets and single-top W t production.
A large fraction of these SM background events can be suppressed by large missing energy

3.2.2 One lepton and two photons channel

T > 25 GeV (l = e or µ) and two leading photons with pγ1

As already mentioned, the other channel that ATLAS collaboration has also considered while
looking for Wh mediated simpliﬁed models, consists of events with exactly one charged-lepton
and two photons in the ﬁnal state. The events are selected either with single-lepton or with
di-photon trigger. For the single-lepton trigger, events are required to have isolated leptons
with with pl
T > 40 GeV (leading) and
pγ2
T > 20 GeV (subleading). For diphoton trigger, the event selection requires pT thresholds
of 15 (10) GeV for electrons (muons), and 40 (27) GeV for the leading (sub-leading) photon.
The most dominant background contributions to this channel come from multi-jet and Zγ
production, where the leptons or jets may be mistagged as photons. An optimum E/T > 40
GeV cut helps to suppress these backgrounds. While reconstructing the (cid:126)pT of the W → lν
system, it is assumed that (cid:126)pT of the neutrino is same as (cid:126)p/T and that it is back to back with
the h → γγ candidate (δφ(W, h) > 2.25). These events are divided into two SRs (SR(cid:96)γγ-1
and SR(cid:96)γγ-2) based on the values of the transverse mass of the W γi system, mW γi

procedure (discussed in previous subsection), we have validated the exclusion limit obtained
by ATLAS for Wh simpliﬁed scenarios. We present the results in Fig. 8. As evident, our
validated results (solid blue line) are in good agreement with the ATLAS exclusion line (blue
dotted line).

3.3 Revisiting the exclusion limits with varying branching ratios

In this section, we revisit the aforementioned search channels varying the relevant branching
ratios into a particular decay mode to study their impact on the existing exclusion limits
provided by the experimental collaborations as discussed in the previous subsection. Quite
obviously, the limits are expected to get weaker if one considers shared decay modes of the
electroweakinos instead of assuming their wholesome decay into one particular decay mode.
For example, in Wh and WZ mediated simpliﬁed models it is assumed that the branching
1 are 100% respectively. But in Sec. 2 we have shown that in the
allowed kinematic region (see Fig. 1) these two decay modes can compete with each other.
Our aim is to assess how much one may expect the exclusion limits to change under such more
realistic situations. We also consider the scenario where electroweakinos are kinematically

4 Summary and Conclusions

In the absence of any signiﬁcant results towards the discovery of new physics beyond the
SM, the experimental collaborations have extensively studied the obtained data so far to put
exclusion limits on the possible BSM scenarios. These experimental limits act as guiding
lights toward our quest of BSM physics. However, one has to choose these mass limits
judiciously as a lot of simpliﬁed assumptions are made in order to obtain such limits. In this
work, we have revisited the exclusion limits on the gaugino masses derived from the Run-
I data at the LHC. The experimental collaborations have looked into various ﬁnal states

comprised of leptons, jets and missing energy in order to put the exclusion limits in the m(cid:101)χ0
plane. While deriving these limits, they work with some simpliﬁed models where (cid:101)χ0

and (cid:101)χ±

1 decay entirely into one of their possible decay modes which although true for some
part of the parameter space, often do not present the whole picture. In realistic scenarios, the
various decay modes may compete with each other and the exclusion limits are expected to
change signiﬁcantly. Our aim was to assess how much deviation of these exclusion limits one
may expect for such scenarios. For that purpose, we have scanned the pMSSM parameter

may also give rise to the similar ﬁnal states studied by the experimental collaborations. We
show some representative benchmark points obtained from our scan satisfying all the relevant
experimental constraints to show the interplay between the branching ratios of the various

their assumptions before proceeding to explore the eﬀects of the interplay of the diﬀerent
plane along with the
existing experimental results to showcase the signiﬁcant deviations. We also observe that in

sleptons can also give rise to the trilepton ﬁnal states and the exclusion limits obtained are
far more severe than that obtained from W Z or W h mediated simpliﬁed models.
