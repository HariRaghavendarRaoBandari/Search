ABSTRACT

In this paper, we investigate the calibration of radio interfer-
ometers in which Jones matrices are considered to model the
interaction between the incident electromagnetic ﬁeld and the
antennas of each station. Speciﬁcally, perturbation effects are
introduced along the signal path, leading to the conversion of
the plane wave into an electric voltage by the receptor.
In
order to design a robust estimator, the noise is assumed to fol-
low a spherically invariant random process (SIRP). The de-
rived algorithm is based on an iterative relaxed concentrated
maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), for which closed-form
expressions are obtained for most of the unknown parameters.

1. INTRODUCTION

The new generation of radio telescopes, such as the LO-
FAR [1] and the SKA [2], are characterized by a large num-
ber of receiving elements, large collecting area and dynamic
range, wide ﬁeld of view, high sensitivity and resolution,
huge amount of measurement data, etc., which entails a
certain number of scientiﬁc challenges. In radio interferom-
etry [3], one of the most important challenges is notably the
calibration [4, 5].

Calibration involves the estimation and the correction of
different unknown perturbations introduced along the signal
path, e.g., due to the environment (atmosphere, ionosphere)
or the artifacts in the instruments (electronic gain, bandpass,
station beam shape and orientation, sidelobe contamination,
etc.). All these physical corruption effects, which may be di-
rection dependent [6], are involved in the radio interferometer
measurement equation and can be modeled with the help of
Jones matrices [7, 8]. Besides, many faint sources are present
in radio interferometric data and can be considered as outliers
in the calibration procedure, leading to deviations from the
commonly assumed Gaussian noise model [9, 10].

To overcome these drawbacks, we intend to robustify the
calibration scheme by using a wider distribution class than

the Gaussian one, to model the noise. In doing so, we do not
specify precisely the noise distribution and we use a broad
class of distributions gathered under the so-called spherically
invariant random distribution [11,12]. A spherically invariant
random process (SIRP) is described as the product of a texture
parameter: a positive random variable, and a speckle compo-
nent: a Gaussian process, resulting in a two-scale compound-
Gaussian distribution. Under SIRP noise, the maximum like-
lihood (ML) method can be used to estimate the unknown
parameters [13]. In our case, to obtain closed-form expres-
sions and to reduce the computational complexity of our prob-
lem, the ML estimates are derived in an iterative way with
a sequential updating procedure [14]. This is the iterative
concentrated ML technique. However, a numerical optimiza-
tion process still needs to be performed and can be computed
efﬁciently for instance with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM)
solver [15–17].

In this paper, we use the following notation: symbols (·)T ,
(·)∗, (·)H denote, respectively, the transpose, the complex
conjugate and the Hermitian operator. The Kronecker prod-
uct is represented by ⊗, E{·} denotes the expectation operator
and bdiag{·} is the bloc-diagonal operator. The trace and de-
terminant operators are, respectively, referred to by tr {·} and
|·|. Finally, the symbol IB represents the B × B identity ma-
trix and vec(·) stacks the columns of a matrix on top of one
another.

2. DATA MODEL

Let us consider D signal sources impinging on a station of
M antennas. Each electromagnetic plane wave is observed
by M antennas and can be decomposed as two orthogonal
polarization directions (x, y). Each antenna is composed of
two receptors, which are sensitive to a particular polarization
[7]. Thus, the measured voltage at the p-th antenna due to the
i-th signal source impinging on it is written as [7, 8]

¯vip = Jip (θ)si

where the relation between each incoming radiation si =
[six , siy ]T and the generated voltage at each antenna ¯vip =
, vipy ]T is given by a 2 × 2 Jones matrix Jip (θ),
[vipx
parametrized by the unknown vector θ. The Jones matrix
accounts for the different perturbations introduced on the
path from the i-th source to the p-th sensor. Hence, for a
given source-antenna pair, we measure two output signals,
i.e., one for each polarization. Since each Jones matrix is
associated with a source-antenna pair, the total number of
Jones matrices is DM .

Typically, in radio astronomy, signals collected by a pair
of antennas (p, q), i.e., two pairs of output signals, are corre-
lated. Then, different crosscorrelation measurements, called
visibilities, are computed for different antenna pairs, with a
speciﬁc baseline. The total number of antenna pairs is B =
M(M−1)
and for a given (p, q) antenna pair, the 2×2 visibility
matrix, in the noiseless case, is denoted by ˜Vpq = E{¯vp ¯vH
q }
and written as

posed of the contributions from D discrete calibrator sources

3. MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION

liers may appear and the Gaussian noise assumption may not
be fulﬁlled [19]. To cope with different noise distributions,
speciﬁcally non-Gaussian noise modeling, and to achieve ro-
bust calibration w.r.t. outliers, we consider a spherically in-
variant random process (SIRP), which is deﬁned for each an-
tenna pair as

npq = √τpq gpq

(6)
where the random variable τpq is positive and real. This
power factor varies independently according to the antenna
pair considered and, in the radar context, is called texture.
The speckle component gpq is a complex zero-mean Gaus-
sian process with an unknown covariance matrix Ω, i.e.,

gpq ∼ CN (0, Ω) such that tr {Ω} = 1,

(7)
where the 4 × 4 covariance matrix Ω is the same for all an-
tenna pairs and a constraint is required on its trace to remove
scaling ambiguities in model (6). Taking into account such
noise model and assuming spatial independence between an-
tenna pairs, the likelihood function is given by

f (v12, ..., v(M−1)M|θ, τ , Ω) =

exp(cid:26)−

with τ = [τ12, τ13, . . . , τ(M−1)M ]T and apq = vpq − ˜vpq. In
the r.h.s. of (8), the product is performed for each antenna pair
so there are B elements in the product. The log-likelihood
function is written as follows
log f (v12, ..., v(M−1)M)|θ, τ , Ω) = −4B log π

The proposed robust calibration scheme is based on an it-
erative ML algorithm [14,20]. The principle is to optimize the
log-likelihood function w.r.t. each unknown parameter, while
ﬁxing the others, leading to the so-called concentrated ML es-
timator. Furthermore, we use in the following a relaxed ML
estimator for which the texture parameters are assumed un-
known and deterministic. This choice is motivated by the fact
that we aim to design a broad robust estimator w.r.t. the pres-
ence of outliers but also in order to avoid a misspeciﬁcation
of the probability density function of τ (i.e., we do not need
to specify the texture distribution, ensuring more ﬂexibility).
A closed-form expression can be obtained for each texture
realization τpq and the speckle covariance matrix Ω. Gener-
ally, no closed-form expression can be obtained for θ, unless
assuming a speciﬁc linear modeling of this vector w.r.t. the
noiseless visibilities.

1) Derivation of ˆτpq: We derive the log-likelihood func-

tion in (9) w.r.t. τpq and equate it to 0, leading to

The D signal sources correspond to the brightest sources,
while the weak ones are considered as noise. Therefore, out-

posed of the entries of all Jones matrices, which is considered
in the following.

4. ESTIMATION OF ˆθ FOR NON-STRUCTURED

JONES MATRICES

The optimization in (17) may be computationally heavy and
very slow in convergence. To overcome this drawback, we

apply the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, as in [9]
and [10]. Since we adopt the non-structured Jones matrices
case (i.e., θ is a collection of Jones matrices’ elements), the
vector θ can be partitioned as

θ = [θT

1 , . . . , θT

, . . . , θT

(18)
meaning that for the i-th source and the p-th antenna, we have
Jip (θ) = Jip (θip ) in which θip denotes the parametrization
of the path i-p.

, . . . , θT

The EM algorithm [24–27] is an iterative procedure to
approximate the ML estimation technique and reduce its
computational cost. First, the E-step computes the condi-
tional expectation of the complete data given the observed
data and the current ﬁt for parameters. Second, the M-step
maximizes the log-likelihood function of the conditional dis-
tribution, previously computed. This may not result in a
closed-form expression and requires a numerical optimiza-
tion procedure. An example of the gradient descent method,
particularly appropriate for non-linear problems, is notably
the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. The E- and the
M-steps are repeated until convergence or until the maximum
number of iterations is reached. The complexity is reduced
since the unknown parameter vector is partitioned over the
sources and optimization is carried out w.r.t. to θi instead of
θ. This leads to single source sub-optimization problems of
smaller sizes.

1) E-step: We introduce the complete data vector w =
D]T where, for the i-th source, the 4B × 1 vector

[wT
wi is given by

such that x = PD
i=1 wi. The noise vectors ni are supposed
to be statistically independent such that ni ∼ CN (0, βiΨ)
wherePD
The covariance matrix of each noise vector npq is given
by τpqΩ. Making use of the independence property, we ob-
tain Ψ = bdiag{τ12Ω, . . . , τ(M−1)M Ω} and the covariance
matrix of w is given by Ξ = bdiag{β1Ψ, . . . , βDΨ}.
Using [28, p. 36], we obtain the conditional expectation
of the complete data ˆw = E{w|x; θ, τ , Ω}, in the jointly
Gaussian case, that is,

ˆwi = ui(θi) + βi x −

5. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

In the following simulations, we consider D = 2 sources and
M = 16 antennas. Therefore, the number of antenna pairs is
B = 120 and there are 128 unknown parameters to estimate,
corresponding to the entries of the Jones matrices. The source
coherency Ci is deﬁned thanks to the Stokes parameters [7,8],
which represent the polarization state of the i-th signal source
considered. The number of Monte Carlo runs is set to 100.

In Fig. 1, we plot the relative mean square error (MSE)
vs. signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), for a given parameter repre-
sentative of the overall behavior. We represent the follow-
ing cases: i) the proposed algorithm as exposed in the pattern

(blue curve) which intends to propose a robust estimator, ii)
the case when Ω is known and τ is set to a vector ﬁlled with
ones during the whole estimation procedure (green curve) and
iii) the case when Ω is set to the identity matrix and τ is
ﬁlled with ones as before (red curve). The two last cases cor-
respond to Gaussian modeling, with spatially correlated and
i.i.d. noise. For all cases, the observations are generated us-
ing the true noise covariance matrix, structured as described
in (6). In Fig. 2, we plot the relative MSE of each unknown
parameter for a SNR of 15 dB.

The lowest MSE is achieved with the proposed algorithm,
which estimates iteratively both texture and speckle compo-
nents and the Jones matrices for calibration. Such perfor-
mance is due to the SIRP noise assumption which includes
many various distributions. The calculations were performed
without precising the distribution considered, thus ensuring
robust calibration to the presence of outliers in the noise (faint
sources). If we do not characterize precisely the noise (i.e.,
we dot not take into account the probability density function
of τ ), we have less information (relaxed ML estimator) but
we reach robustness. The two other curves do not take into
account the noise model as presented in (6), leading to mis-
speciﬁcations and poor accuracy in calibration.

6. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we propose a robust calibration algorithm of ra-
dio interferometers, where non-structured Jones matrices are
used to model the different perturbations introduced along the
signal path. The derived scheme is based on an iterative re-
laxed concentrated ML method, in which a SIRP noise model
is introduced, without ﬁxing the texture distribution. Closed-
form expressions are obtained for the noise parameters (tex-
ture components and speckle covariance matrix) while the es-
timation of the unknown vector θ is performed via an opti-
mization process. The computational complexity of the prob-
lem is reduced with the use of the EM algorithm and the par-
tition per source.
