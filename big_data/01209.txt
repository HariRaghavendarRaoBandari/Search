UNRESTRICTED VIRTUAL BRAIDS, FUSED LINKS AND OTHER

QUOTIENTS OF VIRTUAL BRAID GROUPS

VALERIY G. BARDAKOV, PAOLO BELLINGERI, AND CELESTE DAMIANI

Abstract. We consider the group of unrestricted virtual braids, describe its structure
and explore its relations with fused links. Also, we deﬁne the groups of ﬂat virtual
braids and virtual Gauss braids and study some of their properties, in particular their
linearity.

1. Introduction

Fused links were deﬁned by L. H. Kauﬀman and S. Lambropoulou in [21]. Afterwards,
the same authors introduced their “braided” counterpart, the unrestricted virtual braids,
and extended S. Kamada’s work ([17]) by presenting a version of Alexander and Markov
theorems for these objects [22]. In the group of unrestricted virtual braids, which will
be denoted by U V Bn, we consider braid-like diagrams in which we allow two kinds of
crossing (classical and virtual), and where the equivalence relation is given by ambient
isotopy and by the following transformations: classical Reidemeister moves (Figure 1),
virtual Reidemeister moves (Figure 2), a mixed Reidemeister move (Figure 3), and two
moves of type Reidemeister III with two classical crossings and one virtual crossing
(Figure 4). These two last moves are called forbidden moves.

The group U V Bn appears also in [16], where it is called symmetric loop braid group,
being a quotient of the loop braid group LBn studied in [2], also known as the welded
braid group W Bn.

It has been shown that all fused knots are equivalent to the unknot ([18,27]). Moreover,
S. Nelson’s proof in [27] of the fact that every virtual knot unknots, when allowing
forbidden moves, which is carried on using Gauss diagrams, can be adapted verbatim to
links with several components. So, every fused link diagram is fused isotopic to a link
diagram where the only crossings (classical or virtual) are the ones involving diﬀerent
components.

On the other hand, there are non-trivial fused links and their classiﬁcation is not
(completely) trivial ([12]):
in particular in [11], A. Fish and E. Keyman proved that
fused links that have only classical crossings are characterized by their (classical) linking
numbers. However, this result does not generalize to links with virtual crossings: in fact
it is easy to ﬁnd non-equivalent fused links with the same (classical) linking number (see
Remark 3.8). This answers a question from [11, Remark 1], where Fish and Keyman ask
whether the classical linking number is a complete invariant for fused links.

The ﬁrst aim of this note is to give a short survey on above knotted objects, describe
unrestricted virtual braids and compare more or less known invariants for fused links.
In Section 2 we give a description of the structure of the group of unrestricted virtual
braids U V Bn (Theorems 2.4 and 2.7), answering a question of Kauﬀman and Lam-
bropoulou from [22]. In Section 3 we provide an application of Theorem 2.7 showing
that any fused link admits as a representative the closure of a pure unrestricted virtual
braid (Theorem 3.6); as a corollary we deduce an easy proof of the theorem of Fish
and Keyman cited in previous paragraph. In Section 4 we construct a representation
for U V Bn in Aut(Nn), the group of automorphisms of the free 2-step nilpotent group
of rank n (Proposition 4.5). Using this representation we deﬁne a notion of group of
fused links and we compare this invariant to other known invariants (Proposition 4.10
and Remark 4.11).

Finally, in Section 5 we describe the structure of other quotients of virtual braid groups:
the ﬂat virtual braid group (Proposition 5.1 and Theorem 5.3), the ﬂat welded braid
group (Proposition 5.5) and the virtual Gauss braid group (Theorem 5.7). As a corollary
we prove that ﬂat virtual braid groups and virtual Gauss braid groups are linear and
that they have solvable word problem (the fact that unrestricted virtual braid groups
are linear and have solvable word problem is a trivial consequence of Theorem 2.7).

2. Unrestricted virtual braid groups

In this Section, in order to deﬁne unrestricted virtual braid groups, we will ﬁrst
introduce virtual and welded braid groups by simply recalling their group presentation;
for other deﬁnitions, more intrinsic, see for instance [3, 9, 17, 30] for the virtual case
and [8, 10, 17] for the welded one.

Deﬁnition 2.1. The virtual braid group V Bn is the group deﬁned by the group presen-
tation

where R is the set of relations:

h {σi , ρi | i = 1, . . . , n − 1} | R i

σi σj = σj σi ,

ρi ρi+1ρi = ρi+1ρi ρi+1,

ρi ρj = ρj ρi ,

ρ2
i = 1,

σi ρj = ρj σi ,

ρi ρi+1σi = σi+1ρi ρi+1,

for i = 1, . . . , n − 2;

for |i − j| ≥ 2;

for i = 1, . . . , n − 2;

for |i − j| ≥ 2;

for i = 1, . . . , n − 1;

for |i − j| ≥ 2;

for i = 1, . . . , n − 2.

We deﬁne the virtual pure braid group, denoted by V Pn, to be the kernel of the map
V Bn → Sn sending, for every i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, generators σi and ρi to (i, i + 1). A
presentation for V Pn is given in [4]; it will be recalled in the proof of Theorem 2.7 and
Proposition 5.1.

The welded braid group W Bn can be deﬁned as a quotient of V Bn by the normal

subgroup generated by relations

(F1)

ρi σi+1σi = σi+1σi ρi+1,

for i = 1, . . . , n − 2.

Remark 2.2. We will see in Section 3 that the symmetrical relations

(F2)

ρi+1σi σi+1 = σi σi+1ρi ,

for i = 1, . . . , n − 2

do not hold in W Bn. This justiﬁes Deﬁnition 2.3.

Deﬁnition 2.3. We deﬁne the group of unrestricted virtual braids U V Bn as the group
deﬁned by the group presentation

where R′ is the set of relations (R1), (R2), (R3), (R4), (R5), (R6), (M), (F1), (F2).

BARDAKOV, BELLINGERI, AND DAMIANI

The main result of this section is to prove that U V Bn can be described as semi-direct
product of a right-angled Artin group and the symmetric group Sn: this way we answer
a question posed in [22] about the (non-trivial) structure of U V Bn.

Theorem 2.4. Let Xn be the right-angled Artin group generated by xi,j for 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ n
where all generators commute except the pairs xi,j and xj,i for 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ n. The
group U V Bn is isomorphic to Xn ⋊ Sn where Sn acts by permutation on the indices of
generators of Xn.

Let ν : U V Bn → Sn be the map deﬁned as follows:

ν(σi ) = ν(ρi ) = (i, i + 1),

for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1.

We will call the kernel of ν unrestricted virtual pure braid group and we will denote it
by U V Pn. Since ν admits a natural section, we have that U V Bn = U V Pn ⋊ Sn.

Let us deﬁne some elements of U V Pn (see Figure 5). For i = 1, . . . , n − 1:

For 1 ≤ i < j − 1 ≤ n − 1:

The next lemma was proved in [4] for the corresponding elements in V Bn and therefore

is also true in the quotient U V Bn.

Lemma 2.5. The following conjugating rule is fulﬁlled in U V Bn: for all 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ n
and s ∈ Sn,

ι(s)λi,jι(s)−1 = λs(i),s(j)

where ι : Sn → U V Bn is the natural section of the map ν deﬁned in Theorem 2.4.

Corollary 2.6. The group Sn acts by conjugation on the set {λk,l |1 ≤ k 6= l ≤ n}.
This action is transitive.

We prove that the group generated by {λk,l | 1 ≤ k 6= l ≤ n} coincides with U V Pn,
and then we will ﬁnd the deﬁning relations. This will show that U V Pn is a right-angled
Artin group.

Theorem 2.7. The group U V Pn admits a presentation with generators λk,l for 1 ≤ k 6=
l ≤ n, and deﬁning relations: λi,j commutes with λk,l if and only if k 6= j or l 6= i .

Proof. Since U V Pn is a ﬁnite index subgroup of U V Bn one can apply Reidemeister–
Schreier method (see, for example, [24, Ch. 2.2]) and check that the given set of relations
is complete. Remark that most of the relations were already proven in this way in [4]
for the case of the virtual pure braid group V Pn.

An easier approach is provided by the following commutative diagram:

Moreover, as U V Bn, V Bn can be seen as a semidirect product V Pn ⋊ Sn, where the

symmetric group Sn acts by permutations of indices on λi,j’s (Lemma 2.5).

One can easily verify that relators of type (F1), i.e., ρi σi+1σi ρi+1σ−1

i σ−1

i+1, can be

rewritten as:

i,i+1 ρi+1 ρi )(ρi+1 λi,i+1 ρi+1)λi+1,i+2
and using the conjugating rule given above, we get, for i = 1, . . . , n − 2,

i+1,i+2 ρi )(ρi ρi+1 λ−1

On the other hand one can similarly check that relators of type (F2), which are of the

form ρi+1σi σi+1ρi σ−1

i+1σ−1

, can be rewritten as λ−1

i,i+1λ−1

i,i+2λi,i+1λi,i+2.

From this facts and from above description of V Bn as semidirect product V Pn ⋊ Sn,
it follows that any generator of kerV Pn is of the form g[λi,j , λk,j]g−1 or g[λi,j , λi,k]g−1 for
g ∈ V Pn and i, j, k distinct. The group U V Pn has therefore the following complete set
of relations

(RS1)

(RS2)

(RS3)

(RS4)

λi,jλk,l = λk,lλi,j

λk,i(λk,jλi,j) = (λi,jλk,j)λk,i

λi,jλk,j = λk,jλi,j
λi,jλi,k = λi,kλi,j.

Using (RS3) and (RS4) we can rewrite relation (RS2) in the form

(5)

λk,j(λk,iλi,j) = λk,j(λi,jλk,i).

After cancelation we have that we can replace relation (RS2) with

(RS5)

λk,iλi,j = λi,jλk,i

This completes the proof.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 2.4. The group Xn is evidently isomorphic to U V Pn (sending any xi,j
into the corresponding λi,j). Recall that U V Pn is the kernel of the map ν : U V Bn → Sn
deﬁned as ν(σi ) = ν(ρi ) = (i, i + 1) for i = 1, . . . , n − 1. Recall also that ν has a natural

section ι : Sn → U V Bn, deﬁned as ι(cid:0)(i, i+1)(cid:1) = ρi for i = 1, . . . , n − 1. Therefore U V Bn

is isomorphic to U V Pn ⋊ Sn where Sn acts by permutation on the indices of generators
of U V Pn (see Corollary 2.6).

We recall that the pure braid group Pn is the kernel of the homomorphism from Bn
to the symmetric group Sn sending every generator σi to the permutation (i, i + 1). It
is generated by the set {aij | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n}, where

ai,i+1 = σ2

for i + 1 < j ≤ n.

Corollary 2.8. Let p : Pn → U V Pn be the canonical map of the pure braid group Pn
in U V Pn. Then p(Pn) is isomorphic to the abelianization of Pn.

Proof. As remarked in ([4, page 6]), generators ai,j of Pn can be rewritten in V Pn as

ai,i+1 = λ−1
ai,j = λ−1

for 2 ≤ i + 1 < j ≤ n,

and therefore in U V Pn we have:
p(ai,i+1) = λ−1
p(ai,j) = λ−1
According to Theorem 2.7, U V Pn is the cartesian product of the free groups of rank

For every generator ai,j for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n of Pn we have that its image is in Fi,j and
j,i . So p(Pn) is isomorphic to Zn(n−1)/2. The

it is not trivial. In fact, p(ai,j) = λ−1
statement therefore follows readily since the abelianized of Pn is Zn(n−1)/2.

3. Unrestricted virtual braids and fused links

Deﬁnition 3.1. A virtual link diagram is a closed oriented 1-manifold D immersed
in R2 such that all multiple points are transverse double points, and each double point
is provided with an information of being positive, negative or virtual as in Figure 6. We
assume that virtual link diagrams are the same if they are isotopic in R2. Positive and
negative crossings will also be called classical crossings.

Deﬁnition 3.2. Fused isotopy is the equivalence relation on the set of virtual link
diagrams given by classical Reidemeister moves, virtual Reidemeister moves, the mixed
Reidemeister move (M), and the forbidden moves (F1) and (F2).

Remark 3.3. These moves are the moves pictured in Figure 1, 2, 3, and 4, with the
addition of Reidemeister moves of type I, both classical and virtual, see Figure 7.

BARDAKOV, BELLINGERI, AND DAMIANI

Deﬁnition 3.4. A fused link is an equivalence class of virtual link diagrams with respect
to fused isotopy.

The classical Alexander Theorem generalizes to virtual braids and links, and it directly
implies that every oriented welded (resp. fused) link can be represented by a welded (resp.
unrestricted virtual) braid, whose Alexander closure is isotopic to the original link. Two
braiding algorithms are given in [17] and [21].

Similarly we have a version of Markov Theorem ([22]): before stating it, we recall that
the natural map U V Bn → U V Bn+1, that adds one strand on the right of an element of
U V Bn, with the convention of considering braids going from the top to the bottom, is
an inclusion.

Theorem 3.5 ([22]). Two oriented fused links are isotopic if and only if any two corre-
sponding unrestricted virtual braids diﬀer by moves deﬁned by braid relations in U V B∞
(braid moves) and a ﬁnite sequence of the following moves (extended Markov moves):

• Virtual and classical conjugation: ρi βρi ∼ β ∼ σ−1
• Right virtual and classical stabilization: βρn ∼ β ∼ βσ±1

Here we give an application to fused links of Theorem 2.4.

Theorem 3.6. Any fused link is fused isotopic to the closure of an unrestricted virtual
pure braid.

Proof. Let us start remarking that the case of knots is trivial because knots are fused
isotopic to the unknot ([18, 27]).

Let now L be a fused link with n > 1 components; then there is an unrestricted virtual

braid α ∈ U V Bm such that ˆα is fused isotopic to L.

Let skl = ρk−1 ρk−2 . . . ρl for l < k and skl = 1 in other cases. We deﬁne the set

Λn = ( n
Yk=2

sk,jk|1 ≤ jk ≤ k)

which can be seen as the “virtual part” of U V Bn, since it coincides with the set of
canonical forms of elements in ι(Sn), where ι is the map from Lemma 2.5.

Then using Theorem 2.4 we can rewrite α as:

where li,j ∈ hλi,j, λj,ii and π = s2,j2 · · · sm,jm ∈ Λn (see Figure 8).

We virtualize all classical crossings of l′′

m−1,m using Kanenobu’s technique ([18, Proof
of Theorem 1]):
it consists in deforming the understrand of one classical crossing at a
time, considered in the closure of the link, with a sequence of generalized Reidemeister
moves, pushing it along the whole component. At the end of the process, there is a new
classical crossing instead of the original one, and 2j new virtual crossings, where j is
the number of crossings the understrand has been pushed through. With generalized
Reidemeister moves of braid type, one can change the original classical crossing with a
virtual one and remove the new classical crossing with a Reidemeister move of type I.
Since our crossings are on the top strand, this Reidemeister move of type I is equivalent
to a Markov’s classical stabilisation, so we obtain a new link L′
1, fused isotopic to L,

10

associated to a braid α′
1 who is identical to α1 except that it has a virtual crossing at
the place of the classical crossing considered. This is done for each classical crossing
in l′′

m−1,m.
Since l′′

1,ml′′

2,m · · · l′′

m−1,m has an even total number of generators σm−1 and ρm−1, after virtualizing
l′′
m−1,mρm−1 becomes a word composed by an odd number of ρm−1. Applying the relation
associated with the virtual Reidemeister move of type II we obtain a new link L2, fused
isotopic to L, associated to α2 = γ l′′

m−2,m ρm−1 sm−1,km.

Applying once more Lemma 2.5, α2 becomes γρm−1 l1,m l2,m . . . lm−2,m sm−1,km, where

li,m is a word in hλm−1,i, λi,m−1i.

In α2 there is only one (virtual) crossing on the m-th strand, so, using Markov moves
(conjugation and virtual stabilisation) we obtain a new braid α3, whose closure is again
fused isotopic to L and has (m − 1) strands. In other words, the braid α3 is obtained
removing from α2 the only virtual crossing on the m-th strand, and thanks to Markov
theorem its closure is fused isotopic to L.

If we continue this process, eventually we will get to a braid β in U V Bn whose
closure is fused isotopic to L. At this point, each strand of β corresponds to a diﬀerent
component of L, so β must be a pure braid.

(cid:3)

The technique used in Theorem 3.6 was used, associated with braid decomposition

in Bn, by A. Fish and E. Keyman to prove the following result about fused links.

Theorem 3.7 ([11]). A fused link with only classical crossings L with n components is
completely determined by the linking numbers of each pair of components under fused
isotopy.

The proof in [11] is quite technical, it involves several computations on generators of
the pure braid group and their images in U V Pn. Previous result allows us to give an
easier proof: the advantage is that no preliminary lemma on the properties of the pure
braid group generators is necessary.

Proof of Theorem 3.7. We consider a fused link with only classical crossings L with
n components: when applying Kanenobu’s technique to obtain α2 (see the proof of
Theorem 3.6), one gets a braid with only one virtual crossing on the m-strand, and
removes it, so that the resulting braid α3 only has classical crossings. So, continuing
the process, one gets that L is fused isotopic to the closure of an n-string unrestricted
virtual pure braid β which only has classical crossings.

Even though Bm and Pm are not subgroups of U V Bm, since ˆβ has only classical
crossings, we can consider Bm and Pm’s images in U V Bm and rewrite the pure braid β
in terms of ai,j generators, and conclude as Fish and Keyman do, deﬁning a group
homomorphism δi,j : Pn → Z by

as,t 7→ (1 if s = i and t = j;

0 otherwise

which is the classical linking number lki,j of L’s i-th and j-th components. Any fused
link with only classical crossings L with n components can be obtained as a closure of
1,i · · · aδi−1,i
a pure braid β = x2 · · · xn where each xi can be written in the form xi = aδ1,i

(Corollary 2.8). This shows that β only depends on the linking number of the compo-
nents.

(cid:3)

In [14, Section 1] a virtual version of the linking number is deﬁned in the following
way: to a 2-component link we associate a couple of integers (vlk1,2, vlk2,1) where vlk1,2
is the sum of signs of classical crossings where the ﬁrst component passes over the second
one, while vlk2,1 is computed by exchanging the components in the deﬁnition of vlk1,2.
Clearly the classical linking number lk1,2 is equal to half the sum of vlk1,2 and vlk2,1.

Using this deﬁnition of virtual linking number, we could be tempted to extend Fish
and Keyman results, claiming that a fused link L is completely determined by the virtual
linking numbers of each pair of components under fused isotopy.

However for the unrestricted case the previous argument cannot be straightforwardly
applied: the virtual linking number is able to distinguish λi,j from λj,i, but it is still
an application from U V Pn to (Z2)n(n−1)/2 = Zn(n−1) that counts the exponents (i.e.,
the number of appearances) of each generator. Since U V Pn is not abelian, this is not
suﬃcient to completely determine the braid.

Remark 3.8. Fish and Keynman in [11] suggest that their theorem cannot be extended to
links with virtual crossings between diﬀerent components. They consider the unlink on
two components U2 and L = ˆα, where α = σ1ρ1σ−1
1 ρ1, they remark that their classical
linking number is 0 but they conjecture that these two links are not fused isotopic. In
fact, considering the virtual linking number we can see that (vlk1,2, vlk2,1)(U2) = (0, 0),
while (vlk1,2, vlk2,1)(L) = (−1, 1).

4. The fused link group

4.1. A representation for the unrestricted virtual braid group. Let us recall
that the braid group Bn may be represented as a subgroup of Aut(Fn) by associating to
any generator σi , for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, of Bn the following automorphism of Fn:

(6)

xi
xi+1
xl

,

7−→ xi xi+1 x−1
7−→ xi,
7−→ xl,

i

l 6= i, i + 1.

σi :


Moreover Artin provided (see for instance [15, Theorem 5.1]) a characterization of
braids as automorphisms of free groups: an automorphism β ∈ Aut(Fn) lies in Bn if and
only if β satisﬁes the following conditions:

i) β(xi) = ai xπ(i) a−1
ii) β(x1x2 . . . xn) = x1x2 . . . xn ,

, 1 ≤ i ≤ n ;

i

where π ∈ Sn and ai ∈ Fn.

According to [10] we call group of automorphisms of permutation conjugacy type, de-
noted by P Cn, the group of automorphisms satisfying the ﬁrst condition. The group P Cn
is isomorphic to W Bn [10]; more precisely to each generator σi of W Bn we associate
the previous automorphisms of Fn while to each generator ρi , for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, we

12

BARDAKOV, BELLINGERI, AND DAMIANI

associate the following automorphism of Fn:

(7)

xi
xi+1
xl

7−→ xi+1
7−→ xi,
7−→ xl,

l 6= i, i + 1.

ρi :


We have thus a faithful representation ψ : W Bn → Aut(Fn).

Remark 4.1. The group P Cn admits also other equivalent deﬁnitions in terms of mapping
classes and conﬁguration spaces: it appears often in the literature with diﬀerent names
and notations, such as group of ﬂying rings [3, 8], McCool group [7], motions group [13]
and loop braid group [2].

Remark 4.2. Kamada remarks in [17] that the classical braid group Bn embeds in V Bn
through the canonical epimorpism V Bn → W Bn. It can be seen via an argument in [10]
that Bn is isomorphic to the subgroup of V Bn generated by {σ1, . . . , σn}.

Remark 4.3. As a consequence of the isomorphism between W Bn and P Cn, we can show
that relation (F2) does not hold in W Bn. In fact applying ρi+1σi σi+1 one gets

xi 7−→ xi 7−→ xixi+1x−1
xi+1 7−→ xi+2 7−→ xi+2 7−→ xi+1,

Our aim is to ﬁnd a representation for unrestricted virtual braids as automorphisms
of a group G. Since the map ψ : W Bn → Aut(Fn) does not factor through the quotient
U V Bn (Remark 4.3) we need to ﬁnd a representation in the group of automorphisms of
a quotient of Fn in which relation (F2) is preserved.

Remark 4.4. In [16] the authors look for representations of the braid group Bn that can
be extended to the loop braid group W Bn but do not factor through U V Bn, which is its
quotient by relations of type (F2), while we look for a representation that does factor.

Let Fn = γ1Fn ⊇ γ2Fn ⊇ · · · be the lower central series of Fn, the free group of

rank n, where γi+1Fn = [Fn, γiFn]. Let us consider its third term, γ3Fn = (cid:2)Fn, [Fn, Fn](cid:3);
the free 2-step nilpotent group Nn of rank n is deﬁned to be the quotient Fn(cid:30)γ3Fn

There is an epimorphism from Fn to Nn that induces an epimorphism from Aut(Fn)
to Aut(Nn) (see [1]). Then, let φ : U V Bn → Aut(Nn) be the composition of ϕ : U V Bn →
Aut(Fn) and Aut(Fn) → Aut(Nn).

.

Proposition 4.5. The map φ : U V Bn → Aut(Nn) is a representation for U V Bn.

UNRESTRICTED VIRTUAL BRAIDS, FUSED LINKS AND OTHER QUOTIENTS

13

Proof. We use the convention [x, y] = x−1y−1xy. In Nn we have that (cid:2)[xi, xi+1], xi+2(cid:3) =

1, for i = 1, . . . , n − 2, meaning that xixi+1xi+2x−1
relation (F2) is preserved.

i = xi+1xixi+2x−1

i+1x−1

i+1, i.e.,

i x−1

Proposition 4.6. The image of the representation φ : U V Pn → Aut(Nn) is a free
abelian group of rank n(n − 1).

Proof. From Theorem 2.4 we have that the only generators that do not commute in
U V Pn are λi,j and λj,i with 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ n.

Recalling the expressions of λi,j and λj,i in terms of generators σi and ρi , we see that

the automorphisms associated to λi,j and λj,i are

(cid:3)

j xixj = xi[xi, xj]

xk 7−→ xk, for k 6= i;

φ(λi,j) : ( xi 7−→ x−1
φ(λj,i) : ( xj 7−→ x−1

i xjxi = xj[xj , xi] = xj[xi, xj]−1;

xk 7−→ xk for k 6= i.

It is then easy to check that the automorphisms associated to λi,jλj,i and to λj,iλi,j
coincide:

φ(λi,jλj,i) = φ(λj,iλi,j) : (cid:26) xi 7−→ xi[xi, xj]

xj 7−→ xj[xi, xj]−1.

To see that in φ(U V Pn) there is no torsion, let us consider a generic element w of U V Pn.
It will have the form w = l1,2l1,3 · · · ln−1,n where li,j is a product of generators λi,j
and λj,i. Generalizing the calculation done above, we have that
n−1,n λεn,n−1
n,n−1 ),

φ(l1,2l1,3 · · · ln,n−1) = φ(λε1,2

2,1 · · · λεn−1,n

1,2 λε2,1

where εi,j is the total number of appearances of λi,j in li,j. With another easy calculation
(check out also Remark 4.11) we have that:

φ(λε1,2

1,2 λε2,1

2,1 · · · λεn−1,n

n−1,n λεn,n−1

n,n−1 ) : 

x2 7−→ x2[x2, x1]ε21[x2, x3]ε23 · · · [x2, xn]ε2n
...
xn 7−→ xn[xn, x1]εn1[xn, x2]εn2 · · · [xn, xn−1]εn,n−1

So the condition for φ(w) to be 1 is that all exponents are equal to 0, hence w = 1.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.7. As a consequence of the previous calculation the homomorphism φ coincides
on U V Pn with the abelianization map.

As a consequence of Proposition 4.6, the representation φ is not faithful. However,
according to the previous characterization of W Bn as subgroup of Aut(Fn) it is natu-
ral to ask if we can give a characterization of automorphisms of Aut(Nn) that belong
to φ(U V Bn).

14

BARDAKOV, BELLINGERI, AND DAMIANI

Proposition 4.8. Let β be an element of Aut(Nn), then β ∈ φ(U V Bn) if and only if β
satisﬁes the condition β(xi) = a−1

i xπ(i)ai with 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where π ∈ Sn and ai ∈ Nn.

i xπ(i)gi, denoted by xgi

Proof. Let us denote with U V B(Nn) the subgroup of Aut(Nn) such that any element
β ∈ U V B(Nn) has the form β(xi) = g−1
π(i), with 1 ≤ i ≤ n, where
π ∈ Sn and gi ∈ Nn. We need to prove that φ : U V Bn → U V B(Nn) is an epimorphism.
Let β be an element of U V B(Nn). Since Sn is both isomorphic to the subgroup of
U V Bn generated by the ρi generators, and to the subgroup of U V B(Nn) generated by
the permutation automorphisms, we can assume that for β the permutation is trivial,
i.e., β(xi) = xgi
i . We deﬁne εi,j to be φ(λi,j) as in Proposition 4.6, and we prove that
β is a product of such automorphisms. We recall that xyz = xzy for any x, y, z ∈ Nn,
therefore:

where ai,i = 0.

In particular we can assume that

We deﬁne a new automorphism β1 multiplying β by ε−a1,2

. We have that
β1(x1) = x1, and β1(xj) = β(xj) for j 6= 1. Then again we deﬁne a new automorphism
β2 = β1 ε−a2,1

that ﬁxes x1 and x2.

setting εi,i = 1. The automorphism βn is the identity automorphism: then β is a product

(cid:3)

4.2. The fused link group. Let L be a fused link. Then there exists an unrestricted
virtual braid β such that its closure ˆβ is equivalent to L.

Deﬁnition 4.9. The fused link group G(L) is the group given by the presentation

(cid:28) x1, . . . , xn (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

φ(β)(xi) = xi

(cid:2)xi, [xk, xl](cid:3) = 1

for i ∈ {1, . . . , n},

for i, k, l not necessarily distinct (cid:29)

where φ : U V Bn → Aut(Nn) is the map from Proposition 4.5.

Proposition 4.10. The fused link group is invariant under fused isotopy.

Proof. According to [22] two unrestricted virtual braids have fused isotopic closures if
and only if they are related by braid moves and extended Markov moves. We should check
that under these moves the fused link group G(L) of a fused link L does not change.
This is the case. However a quicker strategy to verify the invariance of this group is to
remark that it is a projection of the welded link group deﬁned in [6, Section 5]. This
last one being an invariant for welded links, we only have to do the veriﬁcation for the

UNRESTRICTED VIRTUAL BRAIDS, FUSED LINKS AND OTHER QUOTIENTS

15

second forbidden braid move, coming from relation (F2). This invariance is guaranteed
by the fact that φ preserves relation (F2) as seen in Proposition 4.5.

(cid:3)

U2 =

Figure 11. The fused link group distinguishes the unlink U2 from the
Hopf link H, but does not distinguish the Hopf link with two classical
crossings H from the one with a classical and a virtual crossing H1. In
fact: G(U2) = N2, while G(H) = G(H1) = Z2. We remark however that
H and H1 are distinguished by the virtual linking number.

Remark 4.11. Let us recall that, according Theorem 3.6, a fused link L admits as a
representative the closure of an element of U V Pn, say βL, and following the proof of
Proposition 4.8, we can deduce that

φ(β(xi)) = x

where ai,i = 0 and ai,j = vlki,j for i 6= j; Since virtual linking numbers are fused
invariants, we get another easy proof of Proposition 4.10. However, it means also that
the knot group is determined by virtual linking numbers; actually, as shown in Figure 11,
is weaker. The relation between virtual linking numbers and the knot group can be
nicely described in the case n = 2 as follows. Let us consider λα
1,2, where γ
is the greatest common divisor of α and β and therefore of vlk1,2 and vlk2,1. The
automorphisms associated to them are

2,1 and λγ

This latter group presentation allows to distinguish these groups for diﬀerent γ ∈ N
(since γ is the order of the central element t of these Heisenberg-like groups, setting that
γ = 0 means that t has inﬁnite order); in particular we can set G(λγ
1,2) := Gγ. For
instance the two links considered in [12], L = \σ1ρ1σ−1
1 ρ1 and U2, have corresponding
groups G1 = Z2 and G0 = N2 and therefore are distinguished by Gγ, while, as we saw
above, have the same classical linking number.

5. Other quotients

Several other quotients of virtual braid groups have been studied in the literature: we
end this paper with a short survey on them, giving the structure of the corresponding
pure subgroups and some results on their linearity.

5.1. Flat virtual braids. The study of ﬂat virtual knots and links was initiated by
Kauﬀman [19] and their braided counterpart was introduced in [20]. The category of ﬂat
virtual knots is identical to the structure of what are called virtual strings by V. Turaev
in [28] (remark that every virtual string is the closure of a ﬂat virtual braid).

The ﬂat virtual braid grous F V Bn was introduced in [20] as a quotient of V Bn adding

relations

(8)

σ2
i = 1,

for i = 1, . . . , n − 1.

It is evident that F V Bn is a quotient of the free product Sn ∗ Sn.
Let us consider the natural projection map f : V Bn → F V Bn, and set f (ρi ) := ρi

and f (σi ) := si for i = 1, . . . , n − 1.

In addition to relations coming from the two copies of Sn, in F V Bn we have mixed

relations

(9)

(10)

siρj = ρj si,
ρi ρi+1si = si+1ρi ρi+1,

for |i − j| ≥ 2,

for i = 1, . . . , n − 2.

We call ﬂat virtual pure braid group F V Pn the kernel of the map F V Bn → Sn deﬁned
by si, ρi 7→ (i, i + 1) for i = 1, . . . , n − 1. With respect to the map f : V Bn → F V Bn,
we have that f (V Pn) = F V Pn.

Proposition 5.1. Let V P +

n be the (abstract) presented group
λk,l = λk,lλi,j,

λk,i(λk,jλi,j) = (λi,jλk,j)λk,i (cid:29).

(cid:28) {λi,j | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Then V P +
and is isomorphic to F V Pn.

n coincides with the subgroup of V Pn generated by the set {λi,j | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n}

Proof. First let us recall that V Pn is generated by elements λi,j deﬁned in Eq. (1) and (2),
and has the following complete set of relations:

(RS1)

(RS2)

λi,jλk,l = λk,lλi,j,

λk,i(λk,jλi,j) = (λi,jλk,j)λk,i.

Now deﬁne the map ι : V P +

sending λi,j to λi,j if i < j or to λ−1
homorphisms and θ ◦ ι = IdV P +

n

so ι is injective.

n → V Pn sending λi,j to λi,j and the map θ : V Pn → V P +
n
j,i whenever i > j. Both ι and θ are well deﬁned

Setting f (λi,j) = µi,j and proceeding with similar arguments as in Theorem 2.7 one

can easily prove that F V Pn admits the presentation:

* {µi,j | 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ n} (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

µi,jµk,l = µk,lµi,j,

µk,i(µk,jµi,j) = (µi,jµk,j)µk,i,

µi,jµj,i = 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 +.

UNRESTRICTED VIRTUAL BRAIDS, FUSED LINKS AND OTHER QUOTIENTS

17

We can proceed as before and to consider the abstract group F V P +

n given by following

presentation:

(cid:28) {µi,j | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

µi,jµk,l = µk,lµi,j

µk,i(µk,jµi,j) = (µi,jµk,j)µk,i (cid:29).

We can therefore consider map ι′ : F V P +
θ′ : F V Pn → F V P +
and θ′ are well deﬁned homeomorphisms and θ′ ◦ ι′ = IdF V P +
Then F V P +
obviously obtained sending µi,j to λi,j.

n → F V Pn sending µi,j to µi,j and the map
j,i whenever i > j. Both ι′
and ι′ ◦ θ′ = IdF V Pn.
n is a group presentation for F V Pn and the isomorphism of the statement is

n sending µi,j to µi,j if i < j or to µ−1

n

(cid:3)

Remark 5.2. For n = 3, the group

F V P3 = hλ1,2, λ1,3, λ2,3 | λ−1

1,2(λ2,3λ1,3)λ1,2 = λ1,3λ2,3i

is the HNN-extension of the free group hλ1,3, λ2,3i of rank 2 with stable element λ1,2 and
with associated subgroups A = hλ2,3λ1,3i and B = hλ1,3λ2,3i, which are isomorphic to the
inﬁnite cyclic group. Moreover, the group F V P3 is isomorphic to the free product Z2 ∗ Z.
The ﬁrst claim follows from the previous theorem. The second one follows from the
observation that setting a = λ23λ13, b = λ23 we obtain the following new presentation:

F V P3 = hλ12, a, b || λ−1

12 aλ12 = b−1abi;

if we denote c = bλ−1

12 and exclude λ12 from the set of generators we get

F V P3 = ha, b, c || [a, c] = 1i = ha, c | [a, c] = 1i ∗ hbi.

Let us recall that there is another remarkable surjection of the virtual braid group
V Bn onto the symmetric group Sn, which sends σi
into (i, i + 1): the
kernel of this map is denoted by Hn in [5]. In the same way we can deﬁne the group
F Hn as the kernel of the homomorphism µ : F V Bn → Sn, which is deﬁned as follows:

into 1 and ρi

µ(si) = 1, µ(ρi ) = (i, i + 1), i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1.

Now let us deﬁne, for i = 1, . . . , n − 1:

(11)

For 1 ≤ i < j − 1 ≤ n − 1:

yi,i+1 = si,
yi+1,i = ρi siρi .

(12)

yi,j = ρj−1 · · · ρi+1siρi+1 · · · ρj−1,
yj,i = ρj−1 · · · ρi+1ρi siρi ρi+1 · · · ρj−1.

It is not diﬃcult to prove that these elements belong to F Hn and that:

Theorem 5.3. The group F Hn admits a presentation with generators yk, l, for 1 ≤ k 6=
l ≤ n, and deﬁning relations:

(13)

(14)

(15)

y2
k,l = 1,

yi,j yk, l = yk, l yi,j ⇔ (yi,j yk, l)2 = 1,

yi,k yk,j yi,k = yk,j yi,k yk,j ⇔ (yi,k yk,j)3 = 1,

18

BARDAKOV, BELLINGERI, AND DAMIANI

where distinct letters stand for distinct indices.

Proof. We can use Reidemeister-Schreier method and check the above set of relations
is complete or we can consider a commutative diagram similar to the one of proof of
Theorem 2.7:

Recall also that, according to [5], the group Hn is generated by following elements:

(16)

hi,i+1 = σi ,
hi+1,i = ρi σi ρi ,

and for 1 ≤ i < j − 1 ≤ n − 1:

(17)

hi,j = ρj−1 · · · ρi+1σi ρi+1 · · · ρj−1,
hj,i = ρj−1 · · · ρi+1ρi σi ρi ρi+1 · · · ρj−1,

with deﬁning relations:

(18)

(19)

hi,j hk, l = hk, l hi,j,

hi,k hk,j hi,k = hk,j hi,k hk,j,

where distinct letters stand for distinct indices. Now, remarking ﬁrst that f (hi,j) = yi,j,
ker f = ker f|Hn =≪ σ2
i,i+1, one can also verify that
ker f|Hn is generated by elements of type gh2
k,lg−1, for 1 ≤ k 6= l ≤ n and g ∈ Hn (details
are left to the reader, but arguments are the same as in Theorem 2.7). Therefore we
have the expected complete set of relations for F Hn.

i | i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1 ≫ and σ2

i = h2

Corollary 5.4. The group F V Bn is linear.

Proof. From the decomposition V Bn = Hn ⋊Sn we have that F V Bn = F Hn ⋊Sn, where
F Hn is a ﬁnitely generated Coxeter group. The statement therefore follows from the
fact that all ﬁnitely generated Coxeter groups are linear and that ﬁnite extensions of
linear groups are also linear.

i = 1,

for i = 1, . . . , n − 1.

Let us consider the natural projection map g : V Bn → F V Bn, and set g(ρi ) = ρi

and g(σi ) = si for i = 1, . . . , n − 1.

In F W Bn, in addition to relations (9) and (10), we also have relations coming from

relations of type (F1), i.e.,

(21)

si+1siρi+1 = ρi si+1si,

for i = 1, . . . , n − 1.

In F W Bn relations (20) and (21) imply that also relations of type (F2) hold, since

from ρi si+1si = si+1siρi+1 one gets sisi+1ρi = ρi+1sisi+1.

Adapting Theorem 2.7 one can easily verify that F W Pn is isomorphic to Zn(n−1)/2. As
a straightforward consequence of Theorem 2.4, we can describe the structure of F W Bn.

Proposition 5.5. Let Zn(n−1)/2 be the free abelian group of rank n(n − 1)/2. Let us
denote by xi,j for 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ n a possible set of generators. The group F W Bn is
isomorphic to Zn(n−1)/2 ⋊ Sn, where Sn acts by permutation on the indices of generators
of Zn(n−1)/2 (setting xj,i := x−1

i,j for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n).

Proof. Let us recall how elements λi,j in U V Bn were deﬁned.

For i = 1, . . . , n − 1:

λi,i+1 = ρi σ−1
λi+1,i = ρi λi,i+1ρi = σ−1

,

i

i ρi .

For 1 ≤ i < j − 1 ≤ n − 1:

λi,j = ρj−1ρj−2 . . . ρi+1λi,i+1ρi+1 . . . ρj−2ρj−1,
λj,i = ρj−1ρj−2 . . . ρi+1λi+1,iρi+1 . . . ρj−2ρj−1.

Relations (20) are therefore equivalent to relations λi,jλj,i = 1. Adding these relations

and following verbatim the proof of Theorem 2.7 we get the statement.

5.3. Virtual Gauss braids. From the notion of ﬂat virtual knot we can get the notion
of Gauss virtual knot or simply Gauss knot. Turaev [29] introduced these knots under
the name of “homotopy classes of Gauss words”, while Manturov [25] used the name
“free knots”.

The “braided” analogue of Gauss knots, called free virtual braid group on n strands,
was introduced in [26]. From now on we will be calling it virtual Gauss braid group and
will denote it by GV Bn.

The group of virtual Gauss braids GV Bn is the quotient of F V Bn by relations

siρi = ρi si,

for

i = 1, . . . , n − 1.

Note also that the virtual Gauss braid group is a natural quotient of the twisted virtual

braid group, studied for instance in [23].

Once again we can consider the homomorphism from GV Bn to Sn that sends each
generator si and ρi
in ρi . The virtual Gauss pure braid group GV Pn is deﬁned to be
the kernel of this map. Since this map admits a natural section GV Bn is isomorphic
to GV Pn ⋊ Sn.

Adapting the proof of Theorem 2.7, we get the following.

Proposition 5.6. The group GV Pn admits a presentation with generators λk,l for 1 ≤
k < l ≤ n and the deﬁning relations of F V Pn plus relations

λ2
i,j = 1,

for

1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.

Moreover as in the case of F V Bn also in the case of GV Bn we can consider the

map µ : GV Bn → Sn, deﬁned as follows:

µ(si) = 1, µ(ρi ) = ρi ,

for

i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1.

Let GHn be the kernel of the map µ : GV Bn → Sn, and yk,l, the elements deﬁned in

subsection 5.1: we can prove the following result.

Theorem 5.7. The group GHn admits a presentation with generators yk,l, 1 ≤ k < l ≤
n, and deﬁning relations:

(22)

(23)

(24)

y2
k,l = 1,
(yi,j yk,l)2 = 1,

(yi,k yk,j)3 = (yi,j yk,j)3 = (yi,k yi,j)3 = 1,

where distinct letters stand for distinct indices.

Proof. We leave the proof to the reader, since one can follow the same approach as in
Theorems 2.7 and 5.3. The key point is that GV Bn is the quotient of F V Bn by the set
of relations

siρi = ρi si,

i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1.

One can easily verify that it implies that yj,i = yi,j, for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. Hence, GHn is
generated by elements yk,l, for 1 ≤ k < l ≤ n. If we rewrite the set of relations of F Hn
in these generators and we proceed as in Proposition 5.1 we get the set of relations given
in the statement. As before, one can also use the Reidemeister-Schreier method to check
that this is a complete set of relations.

As corollary, we have:

Corollary 5.8. The group GV Bn is linear.
