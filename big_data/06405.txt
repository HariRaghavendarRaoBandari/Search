A CONSTRUCTION OF NON–FLAT NON–HOMOGENEOUS

SYMMETRIC PARABOLIC GEOMETRIES

JAN GREGOROVI ˇC AND LENKA ZALABOV ´A

The paper is dedicated to Professor Vladim´ır Souˇcek on the occasion of his 70th birthday.

Abstract. We construct a series of examples of non–ﬂat non–homogeneous
parabolic geometries that carry a symmetry of the parabolic geometry at each
point.

1. Introduction

In this article, we deal with symmetric regular and normal parabolic geome-
tries on smooth connected manifolds. Consider a regular and normal parabolic
geometry (G → M, ω) of type (G, P ). A symmetry at a point x ∈ M is an auto-
morphisms φx of the parabolic geometry such that φx(x) = x and the restriction of
Txφx to the bracket generating distribution T −1M is −id. The parabolic geometry
is symmetric, if there is a symmetry at each x ∈ M .

There are several known constructions of examples of symmetric parabolic ge-
ometries. In particular, there is a simple condition proved in [3] that is necessary
and suﬃcient for the existence of symmetric parabolic geometries.

Lemma 1. Let G be semisimple Lie group and P parabolic subgroup of G. Let
G0 ⋉ exp(p+) be the reductive Levi decomposition of P corresponding to grading
gi of g, where g0 is the Lie algebra of G0 and p+ = g1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ gk.

If the parabolic geometry (G → M, ω) of type (G, P ) is symmetric, then there
is s ∈ G0 acting as −id on g−1. Moreover, if the type (G, P ) is eﬀective, then the
element s is unique element of G0 acting as −id on g−1.

Conversely, if there is s ∈ G0 acting as −id on g−1, then the ﬂat model (G →
G/P, ωG) is symmetric. In particular, there is inﬁnite number of symmetries at
the origin eP given by left multiplications by elements of the form

s exp(−Ads(Y )) exp(Y )

for Y ∈ p+ and symmetries at arbitrary point gP are then given by conjugation
gs exp(−Ads(Y )) exp(Y )g−1. In fact, we get a symmetric ﬂat homogeneous para-
bolic geometry.

It is proved in [2, Proposition 1.29] that for each semisimple Lie algebra g
and its parabolic subalgebra p, there always exist a Lie group G and its closed
subgroup P such that the ﬂat model (G → G/P, ωG) is symmetric. In fact, there

is a general construction of ﬂat and non–ﬂat homogeneous symmetric parabolic
geometries on homogeneous ﬁber bundles over symmetric spaces described in the
article [2, Theorem 2.7.].

There are also examples of ﬂat non–homogeneous symmetric parabolic geome-
tries obtained from the ﬂat model, which are not related to symmetric spaces. It
is shown in [6, 7, 4] that if we remove two distinguished points u, v from the ﬂat
model (G → G/P, ωG) of parabolic geometries of projective, projective contact
and conformal type, then the restrictions of the ﬂat models (G → G/P, ωG) to
M := G/P − {u, v} are still symmetric parabolic geometries. In all these cases,
the manifold M decomposes into several orbits with respect to the action of the
automorphisms group (which consists exactly of elements of G that preserve the
subset {u, v} ⊂ G/P ), and on each of this orbits, the symmetries either preserve
u and v or swap them.

Further, there are constructions of homogeneous symmetric parabolic geome-
tries other than the construction in [2]. In particular, in [3] is presented a construc-
tion of non–ﬂat homogeneous symmetric parabolic geometries on a (semidirect)
product of a ﬂat model of a diﬀerent (non–eﬀective) type of parabolic geometry
and a homogeneous space of a nilpotent Lie group.

There is a natural question, whether there are also non–ﬂat non–homogeneous
symmetric parabolic geometries? It is proved in [4] that all non–homogeneous
symmetric conformal geometries are necessarily ﬂat and it is clear from the proof
that the same result can be obtained for all AHS–structures. However, we will
show in this article that we can combine the constructions from [3] and [6, 7, 4]
and prove that there are types of parabolic geometries for which the question can
be answered positively.

In the ﬁrst section, we show how to combine the above constructions to get
new examples of non–ﬂat non–homogeneous symmetric parabolic geometries. We
discuss several necessary and suﬃcient conditions under which the construction
is applicable. As our main result, we show in the Theorem 1 that there are two
series of non–ﬂat non–homogeneous symmetric parabolic geometries provided by
our construction. We describe these parabolic geometries in detail.

In the second section, we give a proof of the main Theorem 1. The proof consists

of several technical lemmas and we explain the technicalities in detail.

2. Non–flat non–homogeneous symmetric parabolic geometries

Let us ﬁrstly give the statement that explains how to combine the two construc-

tions of symmetric parabolic geometries mentioned in the Introduction.

Proposition 1. Let G be semisimple Lie group and P parabolic subgroup of G.
Let G0 ⋉exp(p+) be the reductive Levi decomposition of P corresponding to grading
gi of g, where g0 is the Lie algebra of G0 and p+ = g1 ⊕ · · ·⊕ gk. Suppose there is a
non–ﬂat K–homogeneous parabolic geometry (G → M, ω) of type (G, P ) satisfying
the following conditions:

(1) K is an algebraic Lie subgroup of the automorphism group of the parabolic
geometry (G → M, ω) acting transitively on M and we denote by H the
stabilizer of a point x ∈ M .

A CONSTRUCTION OF NON–FLAT NON–HOMOGENEOUS SYMMETRIC PARABOLIC GEOMETRIES3

(2) There is u ∈ G covering x and reductive Levi decomposition K = exp(n)⋊ ¯G

such that if we deﬁne the subgroups

exp(n0) := {exp(X) ∈ exp(n) : exp(X)(u) ∈ uG0},

¯G0 := {¯g ∈ ¯G : ¯g(u) ∈ uG0},

and

exp(¯p+) := {¯g ∈ ¯G : ¯g(u) ∈ u exp(p+)},

then H is semidirect product of exp(n0) and the parabolic subgroup ¯P of
¯G with reductive Levi decomposition ¯P := ¯G0 ⋉ exp(¯p+).

(3) There is ¯s ∈ ¯G0 such that ¯s(u) = us for s ∈ G0 acting as −id on g−1.
(4) There is submanifold ¯M of ¯G/ ¯P such the ﬂat model ( ¯G → ¯G/ ¯P , ω ¯G)
restricts to non–homogeneous symmetric parabolic geometry of type ( ¯G, ¯P )
on ¯M .

Then the parabolic geometry

(G|exp(n)/ exp(n0)× ¯M → exp(n)/ exp(n0) × ¯M , ω|exp(n)/ exp(n0)× ¯M )

is non–ﬂat non–homogeneous symmetric parabolic geometry of type (G, P ).

Proof. It follows from the assumptions (2) and (3) that the ﬂat model ( ¯G →
¯G/ ¯P , ω ¯G) is symmetric. Moreover, from [3, Sections 3 and 4] follows, that (G →
M, ω) is symmetric parabolic geometry and the set of symmetries at x contains a
subset isomorphic to s exp(¯p+). Therefore the condition (4) implies that the par-
abolic geometry (G|exp(n)/ exp(n0)× ¯M → exp(n)/ exp(n0) × ¯M , ω|exp(n)/ exp(n0)× ¯M )
is symmetric, because the set of symmetries at the points (exp(X) exp(n0), ¯x) ∈
exp(n)/ exp(n0) × ¯M clearly contains the set of symmetries of ( ¯G| ¯M → ¯M , ω ¯G| ¯M )
at the points ¯x.

(cid:3)

Let us now discuss, when the conditions (1)–(4) of the Proposition 1 can be

satisﬁed.

Firstly, the condition (1) posses only topological restrictions on M , G and P that
are not restrictive. There is a construction in [5, Section 3] that transforms non–
ﬂat K–homogeneous parabolic geometry (G → M, ω) into a parabolic geometry
satisfying in addition the condition (1), after a suﬃcient algebraic completion of
G and P and covering of M .

On the other hand, the conditions (2) and (3) are highly restrictive for non–ﬂat
geometries. We know from [3] that not all types of parabolic geometries can ad-
mit a symmetry at point with non–trivial curvature and there is even less types
of parabolic geometries that admit more then one symmetry at one point, i.e.,
non–trivial exp(¯p+), see the tables in [3]. Moreover, the non–ﬂat homogeneous
symmetric parabolic geometries do not satisfy the condition (2), in general. How-
ever, in the article [3, Section 6 (second construction)], there is a construction of
parabolic geometry (G → M, ω) of type (G, P ) satisfying the conditions (1),(2),(3)
under the following conditions.

Lemma 2. Suppose the type (G, P ) of parabolic geometries satisﬁes the following
conditions:

4

JAN GREGOROVI ˇC AND LENKA ZALABOV ´A

• There is s ∈ G0 acting as −id on g−1 and acting as id on some component

of the harmonic curvature of parabolic geometries of type (G, P ).

• The lowest weight µ in the component of the harmonic curvature, on which
s ∈ G0 acts as id, is preserved by the Cartan involution of complexiﬁcation
of g.

Then there is non–ﬂat K–homogeneous parabolic geometry (G → M, ω) of type
(G, P ) satisfying the conditions (1),(2),(3) of Proposition 1 for K being the auto-
morphism group of (G → M, ω) and µ being its curvature.

Motivated by the construction of non–homogeneous ﬂat examples, we study,
whether these geometries satisfy the condition (4) of the Proposition 1, when we
remove two points from the ﬂat model ( ¯G → ¯G/ ¯P , ¯ω). We know that removing
two points in the case dim( ¯G/ ¯P ) = 1 leads to homogeneous parabolic geometry.
Therefore we need to consider the cases, when dim( ¯G/ ¯P ) > 1. If we look in the
tables in the article [3], we get that there are only two series of possible types (G, P )
(up to covering) satisfying the conditions of the Lemma 2 admitting dim( ¯G/ ¯P ) to
be greater than one. Let us point out that we need to choose the projectivizations
of the groups in order to satisfy the condition (3) for n odd.

(A) Consider G = P Gl(n + 1, R) and P the stabilizer of the ﬂag e1 ⊂ e1 ∧ e2 ⊂
e1 ∧ · · · ∧ el in Rn+1 for n ≥ 2l − 1, l > 3, where e1, . . . , en+1 is the
standard basis of Rn+1. Then the group K of the non–ﬂat K–homogeneous
parabolic geometry (G → M, ω) from Lemma 2 is (as a set) represented
by the matrices from P Gl(n + 1, R) of the form

i,j. This means
that ¯G ∼= L′ × L is the reductive Levi subgroup of K, and the unipotent
radical corresponds to N and Z. The result of multiplication of two ele-
ments exp(X1)¯g1, exp(X2)¯g2 ∈ exp(n) ⋉ ¯G is exp(C(X1, Ad¯g1 (X2)))¯g1¯g2 ∈

bracket in n and the Lie bracket in sl(n+ 1, R) of the matrices representing
the elements of n is precisely the lowest weight of the harmonic curvature
of the parabolic geometries of type (G, P ), which takes entries in N3,1 and
N3,2 slots and has values in Nn+1,3 slot.

The subgroup exp(n0) corresponds to Z entries and the parabolic sub-

L/Q of Grassmannians of (l − 3)–planes in Rn−3. Finally, the element

6

the Lie bracket in sp(2n, R) of the matrices representing the elements of n
is precisely the lowest weight of the harmonic curvature of the parabolic
geometries of type (G, P ), which takes entries in N3,1 and N3,2 slots and
has values in Nn+3,3 slot.

The subgroup exp(n0) corresponds to Z entries and the parabolic sub-
group ¯P is product of the stabilizer Q′ of e1 in L′ and the stabilizer Q of
e4 ∧· · ·∧en in L. Thus ¯G/ ¯P is product of L′/Q′ ∼= RP 1 and the space L/Q
of the maximally isotropic (w.r.t. Ω) Grassmannians of (n − 3)–planes in
R2n−6. Finally, the element ¯s is the diagonal matrix with (1, −1, 1, . . . , 1)
on the ﬁrst n entries of the diagonal.

Since ¯G/ ¯P ∼= RP 1 × L/Q is product of two ﬂat models of parabolic geometries
in both of the above cases (A) and (C), we remove two points from the ﬂat model
(L → L/Q, ωL) and consider ¯M := RP 1 × (L/Q − {l1Q, l2Q}) for some l1Q, l2Q ∈
L/Q. Then the ﬂat parabolic geometry ( ¯G → ¯G/ ¯P , ω ¯G) restricts to a parabolic
geometry over ¯M of the same type ( ¯G, ¯P ). Its automorphisms group consists of
direct product of L′ and those element of L that preserve the set {l1Q, l2Q}. Thus
it decomposes into two components according to the fact whether it preserves
l1Q and l2Q or whether it swaps l1Q and l2Q. This property restrict also the
possible symmetries on ¯M and there is a natural question, whether at least some
symmetries on ¯G/ ¯P survive the restriction to ¯M . There is the following crucial
statement.

Theorem 1. Let (L, Q) be one of the types of parabolic geometries from the above
series (A) or (C). Then ¯M := RP 1 × (L/Q − {l1Q, l2Q}) satisﬁes the condition
(4) of the Proposition 1 if and only if there is q ∈ Q such that ql−1
1 l2Q = e4 ∧ · · · ∧
el−1 ∧ el+1 in the case (A) or ql−1

1 l2Q = e4 ∧ · · · ∧ en−1 ∧ fn in the case (C).

The proof of the Theorem 1 is fairly technical and we give the proof in the
next section. In fact, the proof of the Theorem 1 is equivalent to the proof of the
following statement.

Corollary 1. Let (L, Q) be one of the types of parabolic geometries from the above
series (A) or (C). Then the ﬂat model (L → L/Q, ωL) restricts to symmetric
parabolic geometry on L/Q − {l1Q, l2Q} if and only if there is q ∈ Q such that
ql−1
1 l2Q = e4 ∧ · · · ∧ en−1 ∧ fn
in the case (C).

1 l2Q = e4 ∧ · · · ∧ el−1 ∧ el+1 in the case (A) or ql−1

Let us give the geometric interpretation of the condition in the Theorem 1 and
interpret the condition for the existence of preserving symmetry from Lemma 5.

Corollary 2. Let (L, Q) be one of the types of parabolic geometries from the above
series (A) or (C). Then ¯M := RP 1 × (L/Q − {l1Q, l2Q}) satisﬁes the condition
(4) of the Proposition 1 if and only if the subspaces W1 and W2 corresponding to
l1Q and l2Q have intersection of dimension dim(W1) − 1 = dim(W2) − 1. There is
symmetry preserving the subspaces W1 and W2 at the point of L/Q − {l1Q, l2Q}
corresponding to subspace W if and only if the intersection W ∩ (W1 + W2) is
contained in W1 or W2.

The automorphisms group of the parabolic geometry (G|exp(n)/ exp(n0)× ¯M →
exp(n)/ exp(n0) × ¯M , ω|exp(n)/ exp(n0)× ¯M ) in the case (A) for ¯M := RP 1 × (L/Q −

dim(W3 ∩ (W2 + W1)) = dim(W4 ∩ (W2 + W1)),
dim(W3 ∩ (W2 ⊔ W1)) = dim(W4 ∩ (W2 ⊔ W1)),

where W2 ⊔ W1 is the union of W2 and W1 as algebraic sets.

3. The proof of Theorem 1

In order to proof the Theorem 1, it suﬃces to prove the Corollary 1. So we
will assume that (L, Q) is one of the types of parabolic geometries from the above
series (A) or (C). Since L acts by automorphisms of the ﬂat model (L → L/Q, ωL)
from the left, the restriction of (L → L/Q, ωL) to L/Q − {l1Q, l2Q} is isomorphic
to restriction of (L → L/Q, ωL) to L/Q − {ll1Q, ll2Q} for all l ∈ L.

Therefore we can choose l = ql−1

for some q ∈ Q and work with the parabolic
geometry on L/Q − {eQ, ql−1
1 l2Q}. Therefore the non–isomorphic restrictions
of (L → L/Q, ωL) to L/Q − {l1Q, l2Q} are parametrized by the double coset
space Q\L/Q. We will ﬁnd a suitable representative v ∈ L of the classes in
Q\L/Q and investigate the symmetries on the restrictions of (L → L/Q, ωL) to
L/Q − {eQ, vQ}.

The elements of the Lie algebra l of L, which are diagonal in the bases e1, . . . , en+1
or e1, . . . , fn, respectively, form the Cartan subalgebra of the Lie algebra l. The
Lie algebra q of Q is a standard parabolic subalgebra of l for this Cartan subalge-
bra and we denote by l−1 ⊕ l0 ⊕ l1 the corresponding |1|–grading of l. Then the
subgroups W (l), W (l0) generated by elements of L, L0, which permute the ele-
ments of the bases e1, . . . , en+1 or e1, . . . , fn, respectively, induce the Weyl groups
of l, l0. Let us recall that there are representatives of the classes of W (l)/W (l0)
encoded by the Hasse diagram W q of the parabolic subalgebra q, which deﬁne the
decomposition of L/Q into Schubert cells, see [1, Section 3.2.19].

Lemma 3. Each element of L/Q can be uniquely written as exp(Z)wQ for w ∈
W q and Z ∈ Ad−1
w (l−1) ∩ b+, where b+ ⊂ q is the sum of all positive root spaces
in l. The dimension of Ad−1

w (l−1) ∩ b+ is equal to the length of w in W q.

Consequently, the double coset space Q\L/Q is ﬁnite and is in bijective cor-
respondence with the double coset space W (l0)\W (l)/W (l0). Therefore we can
represent the classes of Q\L/Q by the shortest elements in the Haase diagram W q
from the class in W (l0)\W (l)/W (l0).

We start the investigation of the symmetries of the restriction of (L → L/Q, ωL)
to L/Q − {eQ, vQ} on the smallest cell exp(Z)wQ for w ∈ W q of the length 1. In
the case (A), there is unique w of length 1, which is the simple reﬂection over the
(l − 3)rd simple root that corresponds to swapping el and el+1, and Z is contained
in the root space of the (l − 3)rd simple root of l. In the case (C), there is unique
w of length 1, which is the simple reﬂection over the (n − 3)rd simple root that
corresponds to swapping en and fn, and Z is contained in the root space of the
(n − 3)rd simple root of l.

Lemma 4. Let (L, Q) be the type of parabolic geometry from (A) or (C), let w be
the unique element of W q of the length 1 and let v be the shortest element in W q
representing a class in Q\L/Q. If the length of v is greater than 1, then there is
no symmetry at the points exp(Z)wQ, Z 6= 0 of L/Q − {eQ, vQ}.

Proof. There is a symmetry at the point exp(Z)wQ preserving the points eQ and
vQ if and only if there is Y ∈ l1 such that

exp(Z)ws exp(Y )(exp(Z)w)−1 ∈ Q

and simultaneously

v−1 exp(Z)ws exp(Y )(exp(Z)w)−1v ∈ Q

hold. Since NL(Q) = Q, v−1wsw−1v ∈ Q and exp(Ad−1
wsw−1(Z)) = exp(−Z) hold
for both types (A) and (C), these two conditions are equivalent to the conditions

and simultaneously

Adexp(Z)w(Y ) ∈ q

exp(Ad−1

v Adexp(−Z)w(Y )) exp(−2Ad−1

v (Z)) ∈ Q.

From the structure of W q follows that Ad−1
v (Z) is a non–zero element of l−1, while
the condition Adexp(Z)w(Y ) ∈ q implies that Adexp(−Z)w(Y ) has trivial component
in the root space of (l − 3)rd or (n− 3)rd simple root, respectively. Therefore, there
is symmetry at exp(Z)wQ preserving the points eQ and vQ only if Z = 0.

There is a symmetry at exp(Z)wQ swapping the points eQ and vQ if and only

if there is Y ∈ l1 such that the condition

exp(Z)ws exp(Y )(exp(Z)w)−1v ∈ Q

holds. This condition is equivalent to the condition

exp(Adexp(Z)w(Y ))v = exp(Adw(Y ) + [Z, Adw(Y )] + 1/2[Z, [Z, Adw(Y )]])v ∈ Q.
Since the right multiplication by elements of W (l) acts by swapping columns
in the matrix exp(Adw(Y ) + [Z, Adw(Y )] + 1/2[Z, [Z, Adw(Y )]]), the decisive for

the existence of the symmetry are the entries on the diagonal of exp(Adw(Y ) +
[Z, Adw(Y )] + 1/2[Z, [Z, Adw(Y )]]). But there are numbers 1 on the diagonal ex-
cept the (l − 2)nd and (l − 3)rd position in the case (A) and (n− 3)nd and 2(n− 3)rd
position in the case (C) that both depend on [Z, Adw(Y )]. Therefore, if the length
of v is greater than one, there is no swapping symmetry at exp(Z)wQ.
(cid:3)

Therefore it remains to investigate the symmetries of the restriction of the ﬂat
model to L/Q − {eQ, vQ} for the unique element v of W q of the length 1.
In
this case, we can again use the decomposition of L/Q into Schubert cells to show,
when there is a symmetry preserving the points eQ and vQ.

Lemma 5. Let (L, Q) be the type of parabolic geometry from (A) or (C) and let
v be the unique element of W q of the length 1. Then there is a symmetry at point
exp(Z)wQ of L/Q − {eQ, vQ} preserving the points eQ and vQ if and only if Z
has trivial component in the root space of the (l − 3)rd or (n − 3)rd simple root of
l, respectively.

Proof. Since the conditions v−1wsw−1v ∈ Q and exp(Ad−1
wsw−1(Z)) = exp(−Z)
from proof of the Lemma 4 are satisﬁed for generic v and w and Z ∈ Ad−1
w (l−1)∩b+,
the symmetry exp(Z)ws(exp(Z)w)−1 at the point exp(Z)wQ of L/Q − {eQ, vQ}
preserves the points eQ and vQ if and only if Z has trivial component in the root
space of the (l − 3)rd or (n − 3)rd simple root of l.

It remains to show that there are no preserving symmetries at the other points

of L/Q − {eQ, vQ}. Therefore it suﬃces to show that if the symmetry

exp(Z)ws exp(Y )(exp(Z)w)−1

at the point exp(Z)wQ preserves the points eQ and vQ, then Z has a trivial
component in the root space of the (l−3)rd or (n−3)rd simple root of l, respectively.
Let us assume that the conditions

and simultaneously

Adexp(Z)w(Y ) ∈ q

exp(Ad−1

v Adexp(−Z)w(Y )) exp(−2Ad−1

v (Z)) ∈ Q

hold. If Z has a non–trivial component in the root space of the (l−3)rd or (n−3)rd
simple root of l, then Adexp(−Z)w(Y ) has non–trivial component in the root space
of the (l − 3)rd or (n − 3)rd simple root of l, too. But

Adexp(−Z)w(Y ) = Adw(Y ) − [Z, Adw(Y )] + 1/2[Z, [Z, Adw(Y )]] ∈ q

follows from the condition Adexp(Z)w(Y ) ∈ q, and thus Adw(Y ) ∈ q has non–
trivial component in the root space of the (l − 3)rd or (n − 3)rd simple root of l.
This is contradiction with the condition Z ∈ Ad−1
w (l−1) ∩ b+ for Z with a non–
trivial component in the root space of the (l − 3)rd or (n − 3)rd simple root of
l, because w = v ◦ w′ for some w′ ∈ W q holds and if the (l − 3)rd or (n − 3)rd
simple root of l is in the image of Adw(l1), then the dimension of Ad−1
w′ (l−1) ∩ b+
is dim(Ad−1
(cid:3)

w (l−1) ∩ b+) + 1, which is contradiction.

A CONSTRUCTION OF NON–FLAT NON–HOMOGENEOUS SYMMETRIC PARABOLIC GEOMETRIES11

Therefore it remains to show that there is a symmetry swapping the points eQ
and vQ at the points exp(Z)wQ ∈ L/Q such that Z has a non–trivial component
in the root space of the (l − 3)rd or (n − 3)rd simple root of l. We show this as a
part of the following lemma that summarizes the previous statements.

Lemma 6. Let (L, Q) be the type of parabolic geometry from (A) or (C) and let
v be the unique element of W q of the length 1. Then there is a symmetry either
preserving or swapping eQ and vQ at each exp(Z)wQ ∈ L/Q − {eQ, vQ}.

Proof. Suppose exp(Z)wQ ∈ L/Q − {eQ, vQ} is such that Z has non–trivial com-
ponent in the root space of the (l − 3)rd or (n − 3)rd simple root of l. Since the
conditions v−1wsw−1v ∈ Q and exp(Ad−1
wsw−1(Z)) = exp(−Z) from proof of the
Lemma 4 are satisﬁed for generic v and w and Z ∈ Ad−1
w (l−1) ∩ b+, the symmetry
exp(Z)ws exp(Y )(exp(Z)w)−1 at the point exp(Z)wQ of L/Q − {eQ, vQ} swaps
the points eQ and vQ if and only if

exp(Adw(Y ) + [Z, Adw(Y )] + 1/2[Z, [Z, Adw(Y )]])v ∈ Q.

However, v swaps (l−2)nd and (l−3)rd column in the case (A) and (n−3)rd and
2(n − 3)rd column in the case (C). Therefore there is a symmetry at exp(Z)wQ
if there is 0 on the (l − 3)rd or 2(n − 3)rd position on diagonal in the matrix
exp(Adw(Y ) + [Z, Adw(Y )] + 1/2[Z, [Z, Adw(Y )]]) and the component of Adw(Y )
in l−1 is contained in the root space of the minus (l − 3)rd or (n − 3)rd simple
root of l. If Z ∈ Ad−1
w (l−1) ∩ b+ has non–trivial component in the root space of
the (l − 3)rd or (n − 3)rd simple root of l and there is the duality between the
positive and negative roots, there is Y ∈ l1 such that Adw(Y ) is contained in
the root space of the minus (l − 3)rd or (n − 3)rd simple root of l. If Y is anti–
proportional to the component of Z in the root space of the (l − 3)rd or (n − 3)rd
simple root of l, then there is 0 on the (l − 3)rd or 2(n − 3)rd position on diagonal
in the matrix exp(Adw(Y )+ [Z, Adw(Y )]+ 1/2[Z, [Z, Adw(Y )]]) and the symmetry
exp(Z)ws exp(Y )(exp(Z)w)−1 at the point exp(Z)wQ of L/Q − {eQ, vQ} swaps
the points eQ and vQ.
