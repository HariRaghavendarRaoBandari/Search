L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z DOES NOT EMBED IN L2,Z

NATHAN BROWNLOWE AND ADAM P W SØRENSEN

Abstract. For a commutative ring R with unit we investigate the embedding
of tensor product algebras into the Leavitt algebra L2,R. We show that the
tensor product L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z does not embed in L2,Z (as a unital ∗-algebra). We
also prove a partial non-embedding result for the more general L2,R ⊗ L2,R.
Our techniques rely on realising Thompson’s group V as a subgroup of the
unitary group of L2,R.

1. Introduction

Since the beginning of the study of Leavitt path algebras ([5, 8]), it has been
know that there is a strong connection between Leavitt path algebras and graph
C∗-algebras. In particular, some of the remarkable classiﬁcation results for purely
inﬁnite C∗-algebras have been shown to have partial algebraic analogues for Leavitt
path algebras ([2, 3, 20]). In [12] and this paper the authors continue the tradi-
tion by studying possible algebraic analogs of Kirchberg’s celebrated embedding
Theorem: All separable, exact C∗-algebras embed into O2.
The ﬁrst problem to overcome is to make sense of what is meant by the algebraic
analogue. We certainly want to replace O2 with L2,R, but then have to decide
how to translate the conditions of being separable and exact. Since L2,R has a
countable basis as an R-module, it is only possible to embed R-algebras which have
a countable basis into it, so we choose that as our algebraic version of separable.
What to replace exactness with seems a more prickly question. Exactness of C∗-
algebras has a multitude of equivalent but very diﬀerent looking deﬁnitions [10,
Theorem IV.3.4.18], so we are forced to make a choice. One deﬁnition, where the
name exact comes from, says that a C∗-algebra A is exact if the maximal tensor
product by A preserves short exact sequences. The natural algebraic translation of
that is that A is ﬂat as a module. So a naive translation of Kirchberg’s Embedding
Theorem for involutive algebras might be: All ﬂat involutive R-algebras with a
countable basis embed ∗-homomorphicly into L2,R. However, we will see that this
statement is false, at least when R = Z . We also note that in the case where R
happens to be a ﬁeld K this formulation seems very ambitious since all algebras
over a ﬁeld are ﬂat. While we do not have a counterexample to the naive translation
in this case, it seems unlikely that all algebras with a countable basis should embed
into L2,R.

The main result of [12] is that every Leavitt path algebra LR(E) of a countable
graph E over a commutive ring R with unit embeds into the Leavitt algebra L2,R.
The condition of a countable graph ensures the existence of a countable basis, and
all Leavitt path algebras are ﬂat as R-modules. (A concrete basis is constructed
in [6] for row-ﬁnite E, and this result is generalised to all graphs and all rings of
coeﬃcients in [4, Corollary 1.5.14].) In the present paper we move slightly outside
of the realm of Leavitt path algebras, looking instead at tensor products of Leavitt
path algebras. Through the work of [7], we know that for K a ﬁeld the tensor

product L2,K ⊗ L2,K is not isomorphic to any Leavitt path algebra. A potential
embedding of L2,K⊗L2,K into L2,K is thus a natural question. Indeed, this question
is an open problem in the subject, and has attracted enough attention to be included
on the Graph Algebra Problem Page,1 which is a repository of open problems
for graph C∗-algebras and Leavitt path algebras that was established after the
workshop “Graph Algebras: Bridges between graph C*-algebras and Leavitt path
algebras” held at the Banﬀ International Research Station in April, 2013. This
problem is also discussed in [1].
In our main result we provide an answer to this problem in the case R = Z: there
is no embedding of L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z into L2,Z. More precisely, we prove that there is no
such unital ∗-algebra embedding. We restrict our attention to unital embeddings,
even when considering ∗-homomorphisms over a ring R, because it is known that for
K a ﬁeld any homomorphism from a unital ring into L2,K can be “twisted2” into
a unital homomorphism because all nonzero idempotents in L2,K are equivalent
(see [8, Theorem 3.5]). We discuss the idea of twisting ∗-homomorphisms into
L2,Z in Section 6. Since L2,Z is ﬂat (as a Z-module) and has a countable basis,
a consequence of our nonembedding result is that the naive algebraic analogue to
Kirchberg’s Embedding Theorem described earlier does not hold.
We prove our main result by studying the unitaries in L2,Z; in particular we use
that Thompson’s group V sits naturally as a subgroup UV of the unitary group
of L2,R for any R. In our second result we eliminate the existence of any unital
∗-algebra embedding of L2,R ⊗ L2,R into L2,R under which the tensor u ⊗ v of
any two full spectrum unitaries u, v ∈ L2,R is in UV . For a ring of characteristic
0 we can conclude that any potential unital ∗-algebra embedding of L2,R ⊗ L2,R
into L2,R must send the tensor of full spectrum unitaries to unitaries in L2,R with
nontrivial coeﬃcients. We hope these results and their proofs will inform future
work on solving “does L2,R ⊗ L2,R embed into L2,R” for rings other than Z.

2. Preliminaries on L2,R and Thompson’s group V

In this section we recall the deﬁnition of L2,R, and we discuss a representation of
L2,R by endomorphisms on the free R-module generated by the inﬁnite paths in the
graph underlying L2,R. We then discuss the unitaries in L2,R and their relationship
to Thompson’s group V .

Standing Assumption. Throughout this paper R will always be a commutative
ring with unit.

2.1. The algebra L2,R and a representation. We will be focussed on the graph

and its Leavitt path algebra L2,R, which is the universal R-algebra generated by
elements a, a∗, b, b∗ satisfying

a∗a = b∗b = 1 = aa∗ + bb∗.

2Formally: Let A be a unital R-algebra and let φ : A → L2,R be a ring homomorphism. Since
φ(1) is an idempotent, there exist x, y ∈ L2,R such that xy = φ(1), yx = 1. Then ψ(a) = yφ(a)x
deﬁnes a unital ring homomorphism from A to L2,R. If φ is injective so is ψ.

Note that the relations imply that a∗b = 0 = b∗a. When R is a ﬁeld K, L2,K is the
Leavitt algebra of module type (1, 2) (see [16]). For every word α = α1 . . . αn in a
and b we set α∗ := α∗
1. Every element of L2,R is a ﬁnite R-linear combination
of elements of the form αβ∗, where α and β are words in a and b. The map
αβ∗ (cid:55)→ βα∗ extends to an R-linear involution of L2,R. We write L2,R ⊗ L2,R to
mean the tensor product balanced over R. The tensor product L2,R ⊗ L2,R is an
involutive R-algebra with (x ⊗ y)∗ = x∗ ⊗ y∗.
. We denote
the set of ﬁnite paths by {a, b}∗, and by |α| the number of edges, or length, of a
path α ∈ {a, b}∗. For α ∈ {a, b}∗ and ξ ∈ {a, b}N
denotes the obvious
concatenation. For each α ∈ {a, b}∗ we denote by Z(α) the cylinder set

The inﬁnite paths in the graph underlying L2,R is the set {a, b}N

, αξ ∈ {a, b}N

Z(α) = {αξ : ξ ∈ {a, b}N} ⊂ {a, b}N

.

We denote by M the uncountably generated free R-module generated by {a, b}N
,
and by EndR(M ) the endomorphism ring of M . Consider the maps Ta, Tb : M → M
given by

The universal property of L2,R gives us a unital homomorphism πT : L2,R →

EndR(M ) satisfying πT (a) = Ta, πT (a∗) = T ∗
b .
It follows from the Cuntz-Krieger Uniqueness Theorem [21, Theorem 6.5] that πT
is injective.

2.2. Thompson’s group V and unitaries in L2,R. We are concerned with uni-
taries in L2,R, which are elements u satisfying u∗u = uu∗ = 1. There are two
canonical subsets of the unitary group U(L2,R) of L2,R. We denote by U1 the
subset of unitaries that can be written without coeﬃcients:

U1 =

u ∈ U(L2,R) : u =

αiβ∗

i for some distinct pairs αi, βi ∈ {a, b}∗

.

(cid:40)

(cid:41)

The other subset, in fact a subgroup, is a homomorphic image of Thompson’s group
V . Thompson introduced V , as well as the groups F and T , in unpublished notes
in 1965. A account of his work can be found in [15]. Thompson’s group V can be
realised as a collection of homeomorphisms of the Cantor set. Following [18] we
think of elements of Thompson’s group V as tables

where αi, βi ∈ {a, b}∗ such that

mirrors exactly the one which gives the product of two spanning elements(cid:80)n

Each table determines a homeomorphism of {a, b}N
which maps an inﬁnite path of
the form βiξ to αiξ. The set of homeomorphisms deﬁned by tables is a group under
composition. The calculation that gives the product of two tables as another table

as another spanning element; that is, which shows that U1 is a subgroup. So the

is a group homomorphism of V into U(L2,R). We denote its image by UV . By deﬁ-
nition of U1 and UV we have UV ⊆ U1. We now show that the reverse containment
holds when R has characteristic 0. The case for ﬁelds is covered by [19, Lemma
3.3].
Lemma 2.1. If R has characteristic 0, then UV = U1.

Proof. We need to show that if u =(cid:80)n

which contradicts that πT (u∗u) is the identity endomorphism on M . So we have
i=1 Z(βi) = {a, b}N
i=1 Z(αi) =

We now claim that {Z(βi) : 1 ≤ i ≤ n} are mutually disjoint. Let m = max{|βi| :
m − |βi|. Since each(cid:80)

where x ∈ M is a linear combination with positive integer coeﬃcients of basis ele-
ments of the form νkη for some 1 ≤ k ≤ p and η ∈ {a, b}N
. Since the characteristic
of R is 0, it follows that the expression on the right of (2.2) is not ν1ξ. But this
contradicts that πT (u∗u) is the identity endomorphism. Hence each νi is distinct.
Now, each νj has the form βiγ. So if each νj is distinct, and because they are all
of the same length, then it follows that no βi can be the subword of any other βk for
1 ≤ i, k ≤ n. Hence {Z(βi) : 1 ≤ i ≤ n} are mutually disjoint, as claimed. A similar
(cid:3)
argument using πT (uu∗) shows that the Z(αi) must be mutually disjoint.

The following example shows that the assumption of characteristic 0 is necessary.

is a self-adjoint unitary. We can then use an embedding M4(Z/2Z) (cid:44)→ L2,Z/2Z (see
[12, Example 5.3]) to get a unitary u ∈ L2,Z/2Z given by
u = (ab + ba + bb)a∗a∗ + (aa + ba + bb)b∗a∗ + (aa + ab + bb)a∗b∗ + (aa + ab + ba)b∗b∗.
Clearly u ∈ U1. We claim that u /∈ UV . When we represent the elements of L2,Z/2Z
as endomorphisms of the free module with basis {a, b}N
, as discussed in Section 2.1,
the elements of UV will map basis elements to basis elements, but for any ξ ∈ {a, b}N
we see that

Hence u /∈ UV .

3. Embedding the Laurent polynomials LR[w, w−1, z, z−1]

We prove a positive and negative embedding result for the Laurent polyno-
mials LR[w, w−1, z, z−1] in two commuting variables over R. We ﬁrst show that
LR[w, w−1, z, z−1] embeds into L2,R ⊗ L2,R. We then show that there is no ∗-
algebraic embedding of LR[w, w−1, z, z−1] into L2,R mapping the unitaries w and
z into the image UV ⊂ U(L2,R) of Thompson’s group V .
Proposition 3.1. Let R be a commutative ring with unit. Then LR[w, w−1, z, z−1]
embeds unitally into L2,R ⊗ L2,R as ∗-algebras.
Remark 3.2. To prove Proposition 3.1 we use the following general observation
about ﬂat modules. If E is a ﬂat right R-module, and φ : M → N is an embedding
of left R-modules, then from the exact sequence 0 → M (cid:44)→ N , we get the exact
sequence

0 → E ⊗ M id ⊗φ→ E ⊗ N .

Hence E ⊗M embeds into E ⊗N . Now if E and M are ﬂat R-modules (so both left
and right R-modules), and E embeds into M, then E ⊗ E embeds into E ⊗ M and
M ⊗ E embeds into M ⊗ M. Using the ﬂip isomorphism then gives an embedding

E ⊗ E (cid:44)→ E ⊗ M ∼=−→ M ⊗ E (cid:44)→ M ⊗ M.

Composing with a ﬂip isomorphism once more, we see that if ψ : E → M is an
embedding, then ψ ⊗ ψ is an embedding of E ⊗ E into M ⊗ M.
Proof of Proposition 3.1. We have LR[w, w−1, z, z−1] ∼= LR[w, w−1] ⊗ LR[z, z−1],
and it follows from [12, Theorem 4.1] that LR[w, w−1] embeds unitally into L2,R
as ∗-algebras. Moreover, LR[w, w−1] and L2,R have countable bases and hence
are ﬂat. So the result follows from Remark 3.2 applied to E = LR[w, w−1] and
M = L2,R.
(cid:3)

We state our nonembedding result.

Theorem 3.3. Let R be a commutative ring with unit. There does not exist a
∗-algebraic embedding

φ : LR[w, w−1, z, z−1] → L2,R

with φ(w), φ(z) ∈ UV .

The result is a consequence of the structure of Thompson’s group V . The fol-
lowing proposition extracts results about V from [11] and reformulates them in to
our setting.
Proposition 3.4. If u, v ∈ UV commute, then there exists a nonzero polynomial
q(w, z) ∈ R[w, z] such that q(u, v) = 0.

In the proof we will adopted the notational conventions of [11]. However to ﬁt
as our model for

with the notation of the rest of this paper, we will choose {a, b}N
the Cantor set rather than {0, 1}N
Proof of Proposition 3.4. Fix commuting u, v ∈ UV . Since UV is the homomorphic
image of V and since V is simple, there exist commuting elements g, h ∈ V that are
mapped to u, v. By [14, Proposition 10.1] there exist m, n ∈ N such that all ﬁnite
orbits of g have length at most m and all ﬁnite orbits of h have length at most n.
Let k = 1 · 2 · ··· · m and l = 1 · 2 · ··· · n, then gk and hl have no nontrivial ﬁnite
orbits. If q0(w, z) ∈ R[w, z] is such that q0(uk, vl) = 0, then q(w, z) = q0(wk, zl)
satisﬁes q(u, v) = 0. So it suﬃces to prove the result under the assumption that g
and h have no nontrivial ﬁnite orbits. From here on out we will assume that.

We wish to use [11, Lemmas 2.5 and 2.6] to construct our polynomial. The
notion of a ﬂow graph and the components of support of an element of Thompson’s
group V is introduced in [11, Section 2.4]. Denote the components of support of g
by X1, X2, . . . , Xm and the components of support of h by Y1, Y2, . . . , Yn.

that each Xi has the form Xi =(cid:70)mi
and that g acts as the identity on X0 = {a, b}N \(cid:83)m

From the description of components of support we see that the Xi are disjoint,
j=1 Z(αi,j) for mi ∈ N and paths αi,j ∈ {a, b}∗,

By construction the ri are orthogonal, and since g maps Xi to itself, we have

Since g and h commute [11, Lemma 2.5(3)] tells us that the components of
support of g, h are either disjoint or equal. Thus for j = 1, 2, . . . , n, sj either equals

it is not equal to one of the sj.

• p0 = r0,
• pl+1 ≤ s0,

Furthermore, since pl+1 is a sum of projections onto components of support
of g, we also have that pl+1upl+1 = upl+1. As pl+1 is a subprojection of s0,
and so correspondents to a subset where h acts as the identity, we also have
pl+1vpl+1 = vpl+1 = pl+1. Since p0 will be a (possibly empty) sum of projec-
tions onto components of support of h and a (possibly zero) subprojection of s0 we
see that p0vp0 = vp0. Therefore we also have

Note that q is nonzero since the coeﬃcient of the only w1+m1+m2+···ml+1z2 term is

For 1 ≤ k ≤ l we see that q(pkupk, pkvpk) = 0 because one of the middle factors
of q will be zero. By the deﬁnition of p0 we have p0up0 = p0 so p0up0p0vp0 = p0vp0
and therefore q(p0up0, p0vp0) = 0 since the left most factor of q will be zero. Using
that pl+1vpl+1 = pl+1 and the right most factor of q similar reasoning shows that
q(plupl, plvpl) = 0.

Because the pk are orthogonal we see that

Proof of Theorem 3.3. Suppose φ : LR[w, w−1, z, z−1] → L2,R is a ∗-homomorphism
with φ(w), φ(z) ∈ UV . Then we know from Proposition 3.4 that there is a polyno-
mial q(w, z) ∈ R[w, z] with q(φ(w), φ(z)) = 0. So φ(q(w, z)) = q(φ(w), φ(z)) = 0,
(cid:3)
and hence φ is not injective.

4. L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z does not embed in L2,Z

We now state our main result.

Theorem 4.1. There is no unital ∗-algebraic embedding of L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z into L2,Z.

To prove Theorem 4.1 we need a number of results. We have decided to stay
only in the generality of the integers throughout, although it is probable that some
results can be generalised to cater for more general rings. The ﬁrst step is to give
a characterisation of U(L2,Z), which we do in Proposition 4.4.

tion 2.1.
Suppose, for contradiction, that some of the βi are equal. By relabelling we can
assume without loss of generality that β1 = β2 = ··· = βj, and β1 (cid:54)= βk for all
j+1 ≤ k ≤ n for some j ≥ 2. Let ξ be the aperiodic path abaabbaaabbb··· ∈ {a, b}N

Then we have

Now, for every pair 1 ≤ i (cid:54)= k ≤ j, if αi extends αk we write γi,k for the path
with αi = αkγi,k, and if ξ extends γi,k, we write ξi,k for the inﬁnite path with
ξ = γi,kξi,k. Then the right-hand expression in (4.1) is given by

where the βi all have equal length. By simply collecting like terms and discarding
terms where λi = 0, we may assume that the pairs (αi, βi) are distinct and that
λi ∈ Z \ {0}. It now follows from Lemma 4.3 that all the βi are distinct and hence
they have disjoint cylinder sets.

We claim that the αi also have disjoint cylinder sets. To see this, consider the

For any γ, γ(cid:48) ∈ {a, b}∗ we have that βkγ = βjγ(cid:48) if and only if k = j and γ = γ(cid:48),
since the βi all have the same length. So it follows from Lemma 4.3 that the αiγ
are distinct. Hence no αk is an initial segment of any other αj, and the cylinder
sets Z(αi) are disjoint.

NATHAN BROWNLOWE AND ADAM P W SØRENSEN

To prove Proposition 4.6 we use the following results about endomorphisms of
free abelian groups, i.e. Z-modules. For f, g endomorphisms of a free abelian group
G we denote by supp(f ) = {m ∈ G : f (m) (cid:54)= 0}, and by [f, g] the commutator
f g − gf .
Lemma 4.7. Let G be a free abelian group with basis B. Let f, g, s, t ∈ End(G)
satisfy

(i) the image of a basis element is another basis element or zero; and
(ii) G = supp(f ) (cid:116) supp(g) (cid:116) {0} = supp(s) (cid:116) supp(t) (cid:116) {0}.

Then

[f − g, s − t] = 0 =⇒ [f + g, s + t] = 0.

Proof. We have

[f − g, s − t] = 0 ⇐⇒ [f, s] − [f, t] − [g, s] + [g, t] = 0

⇐⇒ [f, s] + [g, t] = [f, t] + [g, s],

and

[f + g, s + t] = 0 ⇐⇒ [f, s] + [f, t] + [g, s] + [g, t] = 0
⇐⇒ [f, s] + [g, t] = −([f, t] + [g, s]).

So we need to prove that

(4.4)

[f, s] + [g, t] = [f, t] + [g, s] =⇒ [f, s] + [g, t] = 0.

From here on out we will assume the left hand side (4.4).

It suﬃces to check (4.4) on B. To do this we partition B into four sets:
Bf,s = B ∩ supp(f ) ∩ supp(s), Bf,t = B ∩ supp(f ) ∩ supp(t),
Bg,s = B ∩ supp(g) ∩ supp(s), Bg,t = B ∩ supp(g) ∩ supp(t).

For ξ ∈ Bf,s we have that [g, t]ξ = 0 and

([f, t] + [g, s])ξ = f tξ − tf ξ + gsξ − sgξ = −tf ξ + gsξ.

Hence, on Bf,s the left hand side of (4.4) reduces to
f s − sf = −tf + gs.
(4.5)

Reordering the terms we get

(f − g)s = (s − t)f.

(4.6)
Fix ξ ∈ Bf,s. As f, g, s, t all map basis elements to basis elements or zero, we cannot
have sξ ∈ supp(g) and f ξ ∈ supp(s), since then we would get the nonzero basis
element sf ξ equal to the negative of the nonzero basis element gsξ. Similarly, we
cannot have sξ ∈ supp(f ) and f ξ ∈ supp(t). Therefore, if sξ ∈ supp(f ) then we
must have f ξ ∈ supp(s), and if sξ ∈ supp(g) then we must have f ξ ∈ supp(t). In
the ﬁrst case, we see directly from (4.5) that [f, s]ξ = (f s − sf )ξ = 0. In the other
case (4.6) yields that −gsξ = −tf ξ, which by (4.5) gives that [f, s]ξ = 0. As noted
earlier [g, t]ξ = 0 for all ξ ∈ Bf,s, so we have that [f, s] + [g, t] = 0 on Bf,s. Hence
(4.4) is satisﬁed on Bf,s. We check the remaining three cases in a similar fashion:

For ξ ∈ Bf,t we have that [g, s]ξ = 0 and

([f, s] + [g, t])ξ = −sf ξ + gtξ.

So the left hand side of (4.4) reduces to

on Bf,t. Reordering we get

−sf + gt = f t − tf,

(t − s)f = (f − g)t.

L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z DOES NOT EMBED IN L2,Z

11

Arguing as above, we note that for ξ ∈ Bf,t we either have f ξ ∈ supp(t) and
tξ ∈ supp(f ) or we have f ξ ∈ supp(s) and tξ ∈ supp(g). Also as above, we see that
in both those cases we get [f, t]ξ = 0. Hence on Bf,t we have

0 = [f, t] + [g, s] = [f, s] + [g, t].

So (4.4) is satisﬁed on Bf,t.

On Bg,s we have [f, t] = 0 and [f, s] + [g, t] = f s − tg, so that after reordering

the terms, the left hand side of (4.4) reads:

(f − g)s = (t − s)g.

Similar to the above, we note that for ξ ∈ Bg,s we either have sξ ∈ supp(f ) and
gξ ∈ supp(t), or we have sξ ∈ supp(g) and gξ ∈ supp(s). In either case, we deduce
that [g, s] = 0. Hence [f, t] + [g, s] = 0 on Bg,s, and so (4.4) holds on Bg,s.
Finally, we see that [f, s] = 0 and [f, t] + [g, s] = f t − sg on Bg,t. By reordering

the terms, we can write the left hand side of (4.4) as
(s − t)g = (f − g)t.

We conclude, as above, that for ξ ∈ Bg,s we either have gξ ∈ supp(s) and tξ ∈
supp(f ), or we have gξ ∈ supp(t) and tξ ∈ supp(g). Either way, we get that
[g, t] = 0 and therefore that [f, s] + [g, t] = 0 on Bg,t. Hence (4.4) holds on Bg,t. (cid:3)
Lemma 4.8. Let G be a free abelian group with basis B. Let f, g, s, t ∈ End(G)
satisfy

(i) the image of a basis vector is another basis vector or zero;
(ii) G = supp(f ) (cid:116) supp(g) (cid:116) {0} = supp(s) (cid:116) supp(t) (cid:116) {0}; and
(iii) f + g, s + t and f − g, s − t are pairs of commuting automorphisms.

If 0 (cid:54)= q(w, z) ∈ Z[w, z] with q(f +g, s+t) = 0, then there exists 0 (cid:54)= ˜q(w, z) ∈ Z[w, z]
with ˜q(f − g, s − t) = 0.
Proof. Fix nonzero q(w, z) ∈ Z[w, z] with q(f + g, s + t) = 0. Since multiplying
q(w, z) by wz does not change that evaluation at (f +g, s+t) is zero, we will assume
for convenience that

for some n ∈ N.
For every 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n let Ωi,j be the set of words in {f, g, s, t} of length i + j
and with ﬁrst i letters in {f, g} and last j letters in {s, t}. Under composition, we
view each Ωi,j as a subset of End(G). Let C be the collection of choice functions
on {Ωi,j : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n}. We claim that for every ξ ∈ B there is a unique choice
function ϕξ ∈ C such that ϕξ(Ωi,j)ξ (cid:54)= 0 for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. To see that there is a
choice function ϕ with this property, ﬁx 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. Let

0 for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. We now note that, because the supports of f and g partition
G \ {0} and the supports of s and t partition G \ {0}, every choice of ωi,j
1 , . . . , ωi,j
is unique. Hence ϕξ = ϕ is the unique choice function with the desired property.

So we have

u = u+,+ − u+,−,
v = v+,+ − v+,−,

u+ = u+,+ + u+,−,
v+ = v+,+ + v+,−.

Consider the Z-module, or free abelain group, M from Section 2.1, generated by
basis B = {a, b}N

, and the faithful representation πT : L2,Z → End(M ). Let

f = πT (u+,+), g = πT (u+,−), s = πT (v+,+) and t = πT (v+,−)

For (2) ﬁrst note that f, g, s, t satisfy the hypotheses (i), (ii) of Lemma 4.7. More-
over, we have

[f − g, s − t] = [πT (u), πT (v)] = πT ([u, v]) = 0.

Lemma 4.7 now implies that

πT ([u+, v+]) = [πT (u+), πT (v+)] = [f + g, s + t] = 0.

Hence [u+, v+] = 0, and (2) holds. Property (3) holds because (2) gives hypothesis
(cid:3)
(iii) from Lemma 4.8, and then Lemma 4.8 gives the result.
Proof of Theorem 4.1. We know from Proposition 3.1 that LZ[w, w−1, z, z−1] em-
beds into L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z by a unital ∗-homomorphism. We claim that there is no
unital ∗-homomorphic embedding of LZ[w, w−1, z, z−1] into L2,Z. The result will
then follow from this claim because any such embedding L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z (cid:44)→ L2,Z would
induce an embedding LZ[w, w−1, z, z−1] (cid:44)→ L2,Z, contradicting the claim.
To see why the claim holds, let φ : LZ[w, w−1, z, z−1] → L2,Z be a unital ∗-
homomorphism. Then u = φ(w) and v = φ(z) are commuting unitaries in L2,Z. We
know from parts (1) and (2) of Proposition 4.6 that u+ and v+ are then commuting
unitaries. Since u+, v+ ∈ UV , we know from Proposition 3.4 that there is a nonzero
polynomial q(w, z) ∈ Z[w, z] with q(u+, v+) = 0. Now (3) of Proposition 4.6 says
there is a nonzero polynomial ˜q(w, z) ∈ LZ[w, w−1, z, z−1] with ˜q(u, v) = 0. So
(cid:3)
φ(˜q(w, z)) = ˜q(u, v) = 0, and hence φ is not injective. This proves the claim.

5. The case L2,R ⊗ L2,R

In this section we make some remarks about what our results indicate about the
general question of whether L2,R⊗ L2,R embeds into L2,R. While we cannot answer
the question completely we can give some partial results.
Our result for R = Z depends on Proposition 4.4, which gives us a nice char-
acterisation of the unitaries in L2,Z. Since the diﬀerence in the characterisations
of a general unitary and a unitary in UV is so minor (the allowance for minus
signs in the former), Proposition 4.6 allows us to bump up the non-embedding re-
sult Theorem 3.3 which uses UV to the argument required to get a non-embedding
L2,Z⊗L2,Z (cid:54)(cid:44)→ L2,Z. In the general setting we lose such tight control on the unitaries
as the following example illustrates.
Example 5.1. Consider the ﬁeld K = R. There is a unital embedding of M2(R)

into L2,R such that(cid:18)λ11 λ12

(cid:19)

(cid:55)→ λ11aa∗ + λ12ab∗ + λ21ba∗ + λ22bb∗.

λ21 λ22

So for any angle θ we can map the rotation unitary for θ into L2,R to get a unitary

(cos θ)aa∗ − (sin θ)ab∗ + (sin θ)ba∗ + (cos θ)bb∗ ∈ L2,R.

We immediately see that the coeﬃcients of unitaries in L2,R can take uncountably
many values. Furthermore, we cannot simply throw away the coeﬃcients, like in
Proposition 4.6, since aa∗ + ba∗ + ab∗ + bb∗ is not a unitary in L2,R.

14

NATHAN BROWNLOWE AND ADAM P W SØRENSEN

While we cannot see how to generalise our techniques beyond the case R = Z,
we can still apply our results to prove results about more general rings. Namely,
we can show that if K is a ﬁeld of characteristic 0, then any potential embedding
of L2,K ⊗ L2,K into L2,K must use the coeﬃcients.

To make the claim precise we deﬁne

2,R consists of the elements of L2,R that can be written without coeﬃ-

That is, L1
cients.
Proposition 5.2. Let K be a ﬁeld and let φ : L2,K ⊗ L2,K → L2,K be a unital
∗-homomorphism. If K has characteristic 0, then at least one of φ(a ⊗ 1), φ(b ⊗
1), φ(1 ⊗ a), and φ(1 ⊗ b) will not be in spanZ(L1

2,K).

Proof. Because K has characteristic 0 we can, by the Cuntz-Krieger Uniqueness
Theorem [21, Theorem 6.5], embed L2,Z into spanZ(L1
2,K)
is a Z-algebra). As a Z-module L2,K is torsion free, since K has characteristic
0, and hence it is ﬂat as a Z-module. Therefore we can use the observation from
Remark 3.2 to see that we also get an embedding of L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z into L2,K ⊗ L2,K
by simply tensoring the embedding of L2,Z into spanZ(L1
2,K) with itself.
If all four of φ(a ⊗ 1), φ(b ⊗ 1), φ(1 ⊗ a), and φ(1 ⊗ b) are in spanZ(L1
we can deﬁne a unital ∗-homomorphism ψ : L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z → L2,Z such that

2,K) (note that spanZ(L1

2,K), then

ψ(a ⊗ 1) = φ(a ⊗ 1), ψ(b ⊗ 1) = φ(b ⊗ 1),
ψ(1 ⊗ a) = φ(1 ⊗ a), ψ(1 ⊗ b) = φ(1 ⊗ b).

By construction ψ is the restriction of φ when we think of L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z as sitting
inside L2,K ⊗ L2,K. Since L2,K ⊗ L2,K is simple, φ is necessarily injective, and
therefore ψ is injective. But that contradicts Theorem 4.1, so at least one of φ(a ⊗
1), φ(b ⊗ 1), φ(1 ⊗ a) and φ(1 ⊗ b) will not be in spanZ(L1
(cid:3)
We ﬁnd this result to be interesting since it indicates that if L2,K ⊗ L2,K embeds
into L2,K for some ﬁeld of characteristic 0, then the embedding must somehow
reference the ﬁeld.

2,K).

Our results also allows us to say something about potential embeddings for
general rings. We say a unitary in an involutive R-algebra has full spectrum if
q(α) (cid:54)= 0 for all nonzero q ∈ R[x].
(Here, the element q(α) means the obvious
thing. See [12, Remark 2.6] for the details.)
Proposition 5.3. Let R be a commutative ring with unit. Suppose that φ : L2,R ⊗
L2,R → L2,R is an injective, unital ∗-homomorphism. If u, v ∈ U(L2,R) have full
spectrum then φ(u ⊗ 1) and φ(1 ⊗ v) cannot both be in UV .
Proof. By Proposition 3.1 and its proof we see that z (cid:55)→ u⊗1 and w (cid:55)→ 1⊗v deﬁnes
an injective ∗-homomorphism from LR[z, z−1, w, w−1] to L2,R ⊗ L2,R. Call it ψ.
Then φ◦ ψ is an injective ∗-homomorphism from LR[z, z−1, w, w−1] to L2,R, and so
by Theorem 3.3 we cannot have that both φ(ψ(z)) = φ(u⊗1) and φ(ψ(w)) = φ(1⊗v)
are in UV .
(cid:3)

Again the result gives an indication that the ring of coeﬃcients is likely to mat-
ter to a given embedding. However, when working with rings that do not have
characteristic 0 we do not have that UV = U1 (Example 2.2) and so exactly how
the coeﬃcients matter is murky.

6. Note added in proof

After an initial version of this manuscript appeared on the arXiv, the second
named author and Rune Johansen used the characterization of unitaries in L2,Z
given in Proposition 4.4 to give a similar characterization of the projections. We
can use this to conclude that not only is there no unital ∗-homomorphic embedding
of L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z into L2,Z (Theorem 4.1) there is no ∗-homomorphic embedding.
Proposition 6.1. All nonzero projections in L2,Z are Murray-von Neumann equiv-
alent to the unit.
Proof. Let p ∈ L2,Z be a projection. By [17, Theorem 4.5] there exist paths
β1, β2, . . . , βn ∈ {a, b}∗ with disjoint cylinder sets such that

n(cid:88)

i=1

p =

βiβ∗
i .

n(cid:88)

i=1

i ∼ n(cid:88)

i=1

Let α1, α2, . . . , αn be paths with disjoint cylinder sets whose union is {a, b}N
. Then
i } are
i } and {αiα∗
ti = αiβ∗
two collections of pairwise orthogonal projections, we then get (see [9, Proposition
4.2.4]) that

i shows that αi ∼ βi, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Since {βiβ∗

p =

βiβ∗

αiα∗

i = 1.

Corollary 6.2. There is no ∗-algebraic embedding of L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z into L2,Z.
Proof. Let φ : L2,Z⊗L2,Z → L2,Z be a nonzero ∗-homomorphism and let p = φ(1⊗1).
By Proposition 6.1 we have p ∼ 1, so we can pick a t ∈ L2,Z such that t∗t = 1 and
tt∗ = φ(1 ⊗ 1). Then we can deﬁne a ∗-homomorphism ψ : L2,Z ⊗ L2,Z → L2,Z by
ψ(x) = t∗φ(x)t. Note that ψ is unital and that ψ is an embedding if and only
if φ is. But by Theorem 4.1, ψ cannot be an embedding and hence φ is not an
(cid:3)
embedding.
