Abstract

The photodisintegration of 9Be in the energy region lower than Eγ = 16 MeV is investigated

by using the α + α + n three-body model and the complex scaling method. The cross section

exhibits two aspects in the diﬀerent two energy regions. In the low energy region up to Eγ = 6

MeV, the cross section is explained by the transition strengths into the excited resonant states of

9Be, while the dipole transition into the non-resonant continuum states of 8Be(2+) + n dominates

the cross section in the energy region of 6 ≤ Eγ ≤ 16 MeV. Furthermore, it is shown that the

dipole strength at Eγ ∼ 8 MeV is understood to be caused by the single-neutron excitation from

the 8Be(2+) ⊗ νp3/2 conﬁguration in the ground state.

INTRODUCTION

The photodisintegration cross section of 9Be shows various characters in diﬀerent energy

regions. The cross section in a low energy region has been measured to deduce a production

rate of 9Be from the astrophysical point of view [1–7]. In the low energy region up to Eγ = 6

MeV, the cross section has been observed to come from the electromagnetic transitions into

the excited states of 9Be, and theoretically, has been studied within the α + α + n three-

body model [8–11]. In particular, the ﬁrst excited 1/2+ state, observed as a sharp peak just

above the 8Be(0+) + n threshold, has attracted much attention, and its structure has been

discussed in terms of the three-body resonance of α + α + n [8, 9, 12] or the two-body

virtual state of 8Be + n [11, 13, 14].

In the energy region higher than Eγ = 6 MeV, the recent measurement [7] reports the

photodisintegration cross section of 9Be up tp Eγ = 16 MeV, and the cross section shows a

signiﬁcant electric dipole strength below the giant dipole resonance (GDR). An enhancement

of a low-lying dipole strength below the GDR has been observed in a wide range of the

mass number in neutron-rich nuclei and is often denoted by the pygmy dipole resonance

(PDR). The PDR has been discussed in neutron-rich nuclei in relation with the neutron

skin thickness. On the other hand, 9Be is a light and stable nucleus which has been studied

to have a cluster structure, and hence, it is interesting to investigate the mechanism of

the dipole strength in 9Be below the GDR energy region. In the recent measurement [7],

Utsunomiya et al. discussed that the enhanced dipole strength in 9Be at the excitation

energy of ∼ 8 MeV exhausts 10 % of Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule and almost all the

cluster dipole sum rule [7]. It is desired to understand the low-lying dipole strength below

the GDR comprehensively from a viewpoint of the cluster structure of α + α + n in 9Be.

In our previous work, we have investigated the structure of the 1/2+ state of 9Be located

just above the α + α + n threshold energy using the α + α + n three-body model and the

complex scaling method (CSM) [11]. We calculated the photodisintegration cross section

from the ground state into the 1/2+ state and reproduce the observed peak in the cross

section just above the 8Be(0+) + n threshold. On the other hand, we could not ﬁnd a sharp

resonance corresponding to the 1/2+ peak in the cross section using the CSM calculation.

To understand the origin of the 1/2+ peak in the cross section, we performed the calculation

of the pole trajectory by changing the attraction of the inter-cluster force as an analytical

2

continuation. From these analyses, we concluded that the excited 1/2+ state has a virtual-

state character of the s-wave neutron in the 8Be + n system.

In Ref. [11], we focused our discussion on the structure of the 1/2+ state and its contri-

bution to the photodisintegration cross section in the low energy region. Other spin-parity

states than the 1/2+ state were not included in the calculation and the photodisintegration

cross section in higher energy regions was not discussed. In order to understand the fea-

ture of 9Be, it is necessary to examine the photodisintegration cross section by including all

the available spin-parity states connected with the ground 3/2− state via electromagnetic

transitions and by taking into account transitions in higher energy regions.

The purposes of this work are following two: One is to investigate the excited states

of 9Be in low energy region connected with the ground state through the electromagnetic

transitions. The other is to elucidate the mechanism of the enhanced dipole transition in

9Be below the GDR observed by the recent experiment [7]. In the present calculation, we

employ the α + α + n three-body model with complex-range Gaussian basis functions to

describe the scattering states of the α + α +n system retaining the numerical accuracy. We

calculate the photodisintegration cross section applying the CSM with Green’s function to

the α + α + n three-body model, and discuss the mechanism of the photodisintegration

cross section .

This article is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we explain the α + α + n three-body

model and describe the formalism of the photodisintegration cross section using the CSM.

In Sec. III, we show the results of the photodisinegration cross section, and discuss the

structure of the excited states and the mechanism of the low-lying dipole strength in 9Be

up to Eγ = 16 MeV. Finally, in Sec. IV, all results and discussions are summarized.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

A. α + α + n three-body model for 9Be

We brieﬂy explain the α + α + n three-body model employed in the present work, whose

detail is given in Ref. [11]. We here solve the Schr¨odinger equation for the α + α + n system

using the orthogonality condition model [15]. The Schr¨odinger equation is given as

ˆHΨν

J π = EνΨν

J π,

3

(1)

where J π is the total spin and parity of the α + α + n system and ν is the state index. The

energy eigenvalue Eν is measured from the α + α +n threshold.

The Hamiltonian for the relative motion of the α + α + n three-body system for 9Be is

given as

3

2

ti − Tc.m. +

Vαn(ξi) + Vαα + VPF + V3,

(2)

ˆH =

Xi=1

Xi=1

where ti and Tc.m. are kinetic operators for each particle and the center-of-mass of the system,

respectively. The interaction between the neutron and the i-th α particle is given as Vαn(ξi),

where ξi is the relative coordinate between them. We here employ the KKNN potential [16]

for Vαn. For the α-α interaction Vαα we employ the same potential as used in Ref. [11], which

is a folding potential of the eﬀective NN interaction [17] and the Coulomb interaction.

The pseudo potential VPF = λ|ΦPFihΦPF| is the projection operator to remove the Pauli

forbidden states from the relative motions of α-α and α-n [18]. The Pauli forbidden state

ΦPF is deﬁned as the harmonic oscillator wave functions by assuming the (0s)4 conﬁguration

whose oscillator length is ﬁxed to reproduce the observed charge radius of the α particle. In

the present calculation, λ is taken as 106 MeV.

In the present calculation, we introduces the α + α + n three-body potential V3. The

explicit form of V3 is given as

V3 = v3 exp (−µρ2),

where ρ is the hyperradius of the α + α + n system. The hyperradius is deﬁned as

ρ2 = 2r2 +

8
9

R2,

(3)

(4)

where r is the distance between two α’s and R is that between the neutron and the center-

of-mass of the α + α subsystem. The strength and width of the three-body potential, v3 and

µ, are determined for each spin and parity. For 3/2− states, we determine the parameters

to reproduce the observed binding energy and charge radii of the ground state because it is

essential to reproduce the Q-value and the sum rule value of the electric dipole transition in

discussing the photodisintegration of 9Be. To reproduce the ground-state properties, we take

v3 and µ as 1.10 MeV and 0.02 fm−2, respectively. For other spin-parity states, we employ

the same value of µ as used in 3/2− states, and diﬀerent strengths are used to reproduce

the energy positions of the observed peaks in the photodisintegration cross section.

We solve the Schr¨odinger equation with the coupled-rearrangement-channel Gaussian

expansion method [19]. In the present calculation, the 9Be wave function Ψν

J π is described

4

in the Jacobi coordinate system as

Ψν

J π =Xijc

C ν

ijc(J π)h(cid:2)φi

l(rc), φj

2iJ π
λ(Rc)(cid:3)L , χ 1

,

(5)

where C ν

ijc(J π) is a expansion coeﬃcient and χ 1

2

is the spin wave function. The relative

coordinates rc and Rc are those in three kinds of the Jacobi coordinate systems indexed by

c (= 1, 2, 3), and the indices for the basis functions are represented as i and j. The spatial

part of the wave function is expanded with the complex-range Gaussian basis functions [19].

The explicit forms of the complex-range Gaussian basis functions are given as

N S

l (ai) exp (−air2) sin (aiωr2)

N C

l (ai) exp (−air2) cos (aiωr2),

(6)

φi

l(r) =


where N S

l and N C

l are the normalization factors and ai is a width of the Gaussian basis
function. The basis functions in Eq. (6) enables us to treat the oscillating behavior in the

relative motion and is useful to describe the photodisintegration cross section accurately.

B. Photodisintegration cross section in the complex scaling method

To calculate the photodisintegration cross section, we use the complex scaling method

(CSM) [11, 20–25]. In the CSM, the relative coordinates ξ (rc and Rc) are transformed as

U(θ)ξU −1(θ) = ξeiθ,

(7)

where U(θ) is a complex scaling operator and θ is a scaling angle being a real number.

Applying this transformation to Eq. (1), we obtain the complex-scaled Schr¨odinger equation

as

ˆH θΨν

J π(θ) = Eθ

ν Ψν

J π(θ).

(8)

The complex-scaled Hamiltonian ˆH θ and the complex-scaled wave function Ψν

J π(θ) are de-
ﬁned as in Ref. [25]. By solving the complex-scaled Schr¨odinger equation with the L2 basis

function given in Eq. (6), we obtain the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates (their biorthog-

onal states) as {Eθ

ν} and {Ψν

J (θ)} ({ ˜Ψν

J (θ)}), respectively.

When we apply the CSM to the complex-range Gaussian basis functions, we need to

choose the value of the scaling angle θ carefully in relation with the parameter ω in Eq. (6).

for positive values of the scaling angle θ and the parameter ω. To avoid this singularity,

the complex-range Gaussian basis functions with a ﬁnite value of ω require a smaller scaling

angle compared to the real-range Gaussian basis functions, in which the range of the scaling

angle is 0 ≤ θ < π/2. The divergent behavior in the basis function might be serious when

we calculate the long-range operator such as of the E1 transition. In the present work, we

take θ = 12 degrees and ω = 1 to avoid the divergence of the basis functions and to keep

the numerical accuracy in the calculation.

The energy eigenvalues {Eθ

ν } are obtained on the complex energy plane, governed by
the ABC theorem [20, 21]. A schematic picture of the energy eigenvalue distribution is

shown in Fig. 1. In the CSM, the energies of bound states are given by real numbers and

are invariant under the complex scaling. On the other hand, resonances and continuum

states are obtained as eigenstates with complex energy eigenvalues. The resonances are

obtained as isolated eigenstates on the complex energy plane, whose energies are given as

Eθ

ν = Er

ν − iΓν/2. The resonance energies Er

ν and the decay widths Γν are independent to

6

the scaling angle θ. The continuum states are obtained on branch cuts rotated down by

2θ as shown in Fig. 1. The branch cuts start from the diﬀerent thresholds for two- and

three-body continuum states in the case of the α + α + n system as shown in Fig. 1. This

classiﬁcation of the continuum states is useful in discussing the decay modes of the 9Be

photodisintegration.

Using the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of the complex-scaled Hamiltonian ˆH θ, we
deﬁne the complex-scaled Green’s function with outgoing boundary conditions, Gθ(E; ξ, ξ′),

as

ξ′(cid:29) =XνZ Ψν(θ) ˜Ψν(θ)

E − H θ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

In the derivation of the right-hand side of Eq. (10), we use the extended completeness

relation, whose detailed explanation is given in Ref. [26]. Using the complex-scaled Green’s

function, we calculate the photodisintegration cross section of 9Be into the α + α + n

scattering states.

We calculate the cross section of the photodisintegration of 9Be(3/2−) + γ → α + α + n

in terms of the multipole response. In the present calculation, we focus on the low-lying

region of the photodisintegration cross section and take into account only the electromagnetic

dipole responses. The photodisintegration cross section σγ is given by the sum of those by

the E1 and M1 transition as

σγ(Eγ) = σE1(Eγ) + σM 1(Eγ),

(11)

where Eγ is the incident photon energy. The energy E is related to Eγ as E = Eγ − Egs,

where Egs is the binding energy of the 9Be ground state measured from the α + α + n

threshold. The cross sections for the electromagnetic dipole transitions σEM 1 is expressed

as the following form;

III. RESULTS

A. Ground-state properties

The calculated ground-state properties of 9Be are listed in TABLE I, in which v3 and µ

are taken as 1.10 MeV and 0.02 fm−2, respectively, as mentioned in Sec. II. The binding

energy and the charge radius are well reproduced by employing the three-body potential,

while the calculated matter radius is slightly larger than the experimental value.

To see the ground-state structure of 9Be more in detail, we calculate the probability

of each component of the 8Be(J π) ⊗ νlj conﬁgurations. The calculated probabilities are

also listed in TABLE I. The present calculation shows that the valence neutron around 8Be

occupies the p3/2 orbit by 93.8 %, while the excited 2+ component of 8Be has comparable

amount to the 0+ one. This large mixture of the 2+ component is understood using the

(λ, µ) = (3, 1) component in the SU(3) representation, which corresponds to the π-orbital

of the valence neutron. In the SU(3) representation, the (3,1) component gives 53 % and

47 % for the 8Be(0+) ⊗ νp and 8Be(2+) ⊗ νp components, respectively.

B. Photodisintegration cross section and resonances in low energy region

We calculate the photodisintegration cross section of 9Be using Eq. (12). Before calcu-

lating the cross section, we determine the values of v3 for each spin-parity state as shown in

Table II. It is noted that the strength for the 1/2+ state is slightly weakened from that in

our previous work [11]. This comes from the inclusion of other spin-parity states and the

probabilities of the 8Be(J π) ⊗ νlj components in the ground state of 9Be are also shown.

In Fig. 2, the calculated photodisintegration cross section is shown in comparison with

experimental data. Our result well reproduces the observed cross section, not only the peak

positions but also the magnitudes and widths of the peaks. This agreement implies that

our three-body model well describes the scattering states of 9Be in the low energy region.

from the E1 transition into the 1/2+ state, and the calculated cross section shows that the

strength below the 8Be(0+) + n threshold is negligibly small. The second and third peaks

at Eγ = 2.5 and 3.0 MeV in the cross section come from the transitions into the resonances

of 5/2− and 5/2+ states, respectively. The M1 transition into the 1/2− resonance has a

sizable contribution to the cross section at around Eγ = 2.7 MeV. The transitions into the

3/2± states play minor roles in the photodisintegration cross section below Eγ = 6 MeV.

Using the CSM, we obtain the resonances corresponding to the isolated poles of the

S-matrix as complex energy eigenvalues. Our results of the resonance energies and decay

widths for the excited states up to Eγ = 6 MeV are listed in TABLE III in comparison

with the experimental data. The energy level diagram is also shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3,

we show the levels which are obtained using v3 = 1.10 MeV commonly for all the spin-

parity states for reference. The calculated resonance energies and decay widths show good

correspondences to the observed data, while the resonance energies of the excited states are

shifted up by applying more repulsive three-body potential than those in Table. II. However,

we cannot ﬁnd any isolated resonance of the 1/2+ state in the present calculation, while

the photodisintegration into the 1/2+ states has a signiﬁcant peak above the 8Be(0+) + n

threshold. These facts are consistent with our previous result [11].

It is noted that we

conﬁrm the 1/2+ state has the virtual-state character of the 8Be + n system from a similar

analysis to that in Ref. [11].

C. Low-lying dipole strength at Eγ ∼ 8 MeV

We investigate the photodisintegration cross section above Eγ = 6 MeV and discuss the

dipole strength of 9Be below the GDR. In Fig. 4, we show the calculated photodisintegration

cross section up to Eγ = 16 MeV in comparison with the experimental data. From the result

in Fig. 4, we see that calculated cross section has a broad peak at Eγ ∼ 8 MeV as similar

to the experimental data and the peak is dominated by the E1 transitions into 3/2+ and

5/2+. In the present CSM calculation, we do not ﬁnd any isolated resonances corresponding

to the peak. Therefore, the peak at Eγ ∼ 8 MeV is understood to be described by the E1

transition from the ground state into the non-resonant continuum states of 3/2+ and 5/2+.

It is also seen that our calculation slightly underestimates the observed peak in the cross

section. This underestimation suggests a contribution from degrees of freedom beyond the

relative motion of the α + α + n system in the present model. For example, the GDR is

known to be described by coherent 1p-1h excitations, but the 1p-1h excitations from the α

particle are not taken into account in our α + α + n three-body model.

In the recent measurement, it is reported that the energy-integrated strength for the

enhanced dipole strength newly measured for 4 ≤ Eγ ≤ 16 MeV is estimated to be

11.3 mb MeV as a lower limit [7]. In Ref. [7], it is suggested that this energy-integrated

strength exhausts 10 % of the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn (TRK) sum rule and almost all of the

energy-weighted cluster dipole sum rule. We calculated the corresponding energy-integrated

strengths integrating the cross section σE1 for the electric dipole transition over the energy

interval of 4 ≤ Eγ ≤ 16 MeV. We obtain the energy-integrated strength as 12.1 mb MeV

for this energy interval, and the result is consistent with the experimental value (11.3 mb

MeV). On the other hand, we also obtain the energy-integrated strengths for Eγ < 4 MeV

and Eγ > 16 MeV as 0.954 and 8.40 mb MeV, respectively.

It is seen that the energy-

integrated strength for 4 ≤ Eγ ≤ 16 MeV is 56.5 % of the energy-weighted cluster dipole

12

sum rule in the present calculation.

In the CSM, the energy eigenvalues of unbound states are classiﬁed into those of the

resonance and several families of the two- and three-body non-resonant continuum states as

shown in Fig. 1. Combing the energy eigenvalues in the CSM with Eq. (13), we decomose

the photodisintegration cross section into diﬀerent families of the non-resonant continuum

states. In Figs 5 and 6, we show the decomposed photodisintegration cross sections for the

3/2+ and 5/2+ states, respectively. We do not show the 5He + n components in Figs. 5

and 6, since their contributions are much smaller than those from other components. In

both results, we conﬁrmed that the cross sections at Eγ ∼ 8 MeV are dominated by the

contributions from the 8Be(2+) + n non-resonant continuum states, while that from the

8Be(0+) + n ones is negligible in the cross section. Furthermore, we see that the three-body

continuum states of α + α + n have sizable contributions to the low-lying dipole strengths.

The decomposed photodisintegration cross sections show that the enhanced dipole

strength at Eγ ∼ 8 MeV is described by the single-neutron excitation from the 8Be(2+) ⊗ νp3/2

conﬁguration in the ground state because the E1 transition operator cannot directly excite

the relative motion between two α’s from the 0+ to 2+ states. The ground-state wave func-

tion has the large (3,1) component in the SU(3) representation, and the (3,1) component

gives a mixture of the 8Be(0+) ⊗ νp and 8Be(2+) ⊗ νp conﬁgurations. Our result shows

that the ground-state structure of 9Be is essential to reproduce the observed dipole strength

at Eγ ∼ 8 MeV.

On the other hand, the contribution from the non-resonant continuum states of 8Be(0+) + n

is negligibly small in the photodisintegration cross section. This fact seems to be that the

8Be(0+) ⊗ νp3/2 conﬁguration is mainly excited into the resonances. To conﬁrm this, it

would be important to investigate the structures of the excited resonances of 9Be and the

further analysis will be performed in forthcoming paper.

IV. SUMMARY

In this work, we investigate the photodisintegration of 9Be in the energy region lower

than Eγ = 16 MeV by using the α + α + n three-body model and the complex scaling

method (CSM). We here employ the complex-range Gaussian basis functions, which enables

us to describe the oscillating behaviors of the scattering states of the α + α + n system

and to calculate the transition strength accurately. We calculate the photodisintegration

cross section up to Eγ = 16 MeV and show good agreement with the observed data. From

the calculated cross section, we discuss the following two points: One is the structures of

the excited states of 9Be observed in the photodisintegration in the low energy region up to

Eγ = 6 MeV. The other is the origin of the enhanced dipole strength at Eγ ∼ 8 MeV below

the GDR.

In addition to the photodisintegration cross section, we also show the resonance energies

and decay widths of the excited states obtained in the present calculation below Eγ = 6

MeV. It is shown that the calculated resonance energies and decay widths are consistent

with the observed energy levels while the the 1/2+ state is the exceptional case. We conﬁrm

that the 1/2+ state has the virtual-state character of the 8Be + n system from the similar

14

analysis to that in our previous work. The photodisintegration cross section up to Eγ = 6

MeV can be understood by the summation of transition strengths into each excited state of

9Be.

For the energy region of 6 ≤ Eγ ≤ 16 MeV, our calculation shows a signiﬁcant dipole

strength at Eγ ∼ 8 MeV and a good agreement with the recent observed data of the

photodisintegration. We ﬁnd that this dipole strength is dominated by the transitions

into the non-resonant continuum states of 3/2+ and 5/2+. To understand the origin of the

dipole strength, we decompose the photodisintegration cross section into each non-resonant

continuum state by the use of the energy eigenvalue distribution in the CSM. From the

decomposed cross section, it is shown that the strength mainly comes from the transitions

into the 8Be(2+) + n non-resonant continuum states. This fact can be understood by a

dipole excitation of the single neutron from the 8Be(2+) ⊗ νp3/2 conﬁguration in the 9Be

ground state.

In the present calculation, we do not investigate the structures of the excited resonances in

detail. It would be important to see the structures of the resonances to gain a comprehensive

understanding of the photodisintegration of 9Be, and the detailed analysis of the resonances

will be performed in the forthcoming paper.
