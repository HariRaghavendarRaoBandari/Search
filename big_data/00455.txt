ABSTRACT

We report the discovery of an oﬀ-nuclear ultrasoft hyper-luminous X-ray source candidate
3XMM J141711.1+522541 in the inactive S0 galaxy SDSS J141711.07+522540.8 (z = 0.41827,
dL = 2.3 Gpc) in the Extended Groth Strip. It is located at a projected oﬀset of ∼1.′′0 (5.2 kpc)
from the nucleus of the galaxy and was serendipitously detected in ﬁve XMM-Newton observations in
2000 July. Two observations have enough counts and can be ﬁtted with a standard thermal disk with
an apparent inner disk temperature kTMCD ∼ 0.13 keV and a 0.28–14.2 keV unabsorbed luminosity
LX ∼ 4×1043 erg s−1 in the source rest frame. The source was still detected in three Chandra observa-
tions in 2002 August, with similarily ultrasoft but fainter spectra (kTMCD ∼ 0.17 keV, LX ∼ 0.5 × 1043
erg s−1). It was not detected in later observations, including two by Chandra in 2005 October, one
by XMM-Newton in 2014 January, and two by Chandra in 2014 September–October, implying a
long-term ﬂux variation factor of >14. Therefore the source could be a transient with an outburst in
2000–2002. It has a faint optical counterpart candidate, with apparent magnitudes of mF606W = 26.3
AB mag and mF814W = 25.5 AB mag in 2004 December (implying an absolute V -band magnitude of
∼−15.9 AB mag). We discuss various explanations for the source and ﬁnd that it is best explained as
a massive black hole (BH) embedded in the nucleus of a possibly stripped satellite galaxy, with the
X-ray outburst due to tidal disruption of a surrounding star by the BH. The BH mass is ∼ 105 M⊙,
assuming the peak X-ray luminosity at around the Eddington limit.

1. INTRODUCTION

Optical dynamical measurements have conﬁrmed the
existence of stellar-mass black holes (BHs, ∼10 M⊙) in
some Galactic X-ray binaries (Remillard & McClintock
2006; McClintock & Remillard 2006) and supermassive
BHs (SMBHs; ∼105−10 M⊙) in the centers of massive
galaxies (Kormendy & Richstone 1995). Most Galactic
BH X-ray binaries are discovered when they experience

transient outbursts. Many SMBHs are detected as ac-
tive galactic nuclei (AGNs), while quiescent SMBHs can
reveal themselves temporarily through tidal disruption
of surrounding stars (Lidskii & Ozernoi 1979; Rees 1988,
1990). A few tens of tidal disruption event (TDE) candi-
dates have been discovered in various wavelengths, with
about twenty in X-rays (Komossa 2012, 2015). Their
positions, at least for the X-ray candidates, are all con-
sistent with emanating from the nuclei of their candidate
host galaxies.

Oﬀ-nuclear/wandering massive BHs,

including
intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs, ∼102–105 M⊙) and
SMBHs, have been predicted to exist through several
important astrophysical processes. The processes for
forming wandering IMBHs include, e.g., the collapse of
massive population III stars in the early Universe (e.g.,
Madau & Rees 2001); runaway merging of massive stars
in young compact star clusters (e.g., Ebisuzaki et al.
2001; G¨urkan et al. 2004); and accretion of a large
amount of gas lost by the ﬁrst generation of giant stars
in the center of globular clusters (e.g., Vesperini et al.
2010). Given that galaxy merging is ubiquitous and that
many dwarf galaxies with optical or X-ray signatures of
nuclear massive BHs have been discovered (Reines et al.
2011, 2013; Maksym et al. 2013, 2014; Donato et al.
2014; Baldassare et al. 2015; Lemons et al. 2015), tidal
stripping of merging satellite dwarf galaxies might result
in wandering IMBHs or SMBHs (e.g. Islam et al. 2003;
Bellovary et al. 2010). A SMBH of mass ∼2.1 × 107 M⊙
has been found in one of the brightest ultracompact
dwarf galaxies (UCDs) yet known, i.e., UCD1 in M60,

2

Lin et al.

and many less massive UCDs were suggested as also
ontaining wandering massive BHs (Seth et al. 2014).
Wandering massive BHs embedded in compact stellar
clusters can be revealed in several ways, such as accreting
mass from a stellar companian or tidal disruption of sur-
rounding stars (Baumgardt et al. 2004; Hopman et al.
2004; Baumgardt et al. 2006; Ramirez-Ruiz & Rosswog
2009; MacLeod et al. 2014, 2015).

(ULXs,

Many ultra-luminous X-ray sources

see
Feng & Soria 2011, for a review), which are oﬀ-nuclear
point sources reaching LX > 1039 erg s−1 (the Ed-
dington limit for a stellar-mass BH of ∼10 M⊙), have
been detected within nearby galaxies. However, most
ULXs are still not luminous enough to be unambigu-
ously associated with massive BHs; the beaming eﬀect
and/or super-Eddington accretion rates onto stellar-mass
BHs can explain luminosities up to ∼1041 erg s−1 (e.g.,
Poutanen et al. 2007). With dynamical measurements
of the masses of the BHs in two ULXs (Liu et al. 2013;
Motch et al. 2014), detection of two transient ULXs in
M31 showing transition from the super-Eddington state
to standard spectral states of Galactic BH X-ray bi-
naries (Middleton et al. 2012, 2013), and the conﬁrma-
tion of the ubiquitous curved spectra at high energy
in the ULX spectra by NuSTAR (e.g., Bachetti et al.
2013; Walton et al. 2014), most ULXs are now be-
lieved to be super-Eddington accreting stellar-mass BHs.
Bachetti et al. (2014) even found a ULX (M82 X-2) pow-
ered by an accreting neutron star.

In contrast, hyper-luminous X-ray sources (HLXs,
LX > 1041 erg s−1) are diﬃcult to explain as stellar-
mass BHs with beaming eﬀects and/or super-Eddington
accretion rates and are good targets to search for wander-
ing massive BHs. ESO 243-49 HLX-1 is the most lumi-
nous HLX yet detected, with peak luminosity LX ∼ 1042
erg s−1 and thermal disk temperatures of <0.3 keV,
and has been argued to be an IMBH of ∼104 M⊙
(e.g., Farrell et al. 2009; Servillat et al. 2011; Webb et al.
2012; Godet et al. 2012). There are a dozen other HLX
candidates, which have lower luminosities and hard X-
ray spectra and are mostly persistent with ﬂux variation
factors of a few (e.g., Sutton et al. 2012). Some of them
were shown to be background AGNs (e.g. Sutton et al.
2012, 2015). Some of the others show special properties
distinguishing them from AGNs and are good HLX can-
didates hosting massive BHs (e.g., M82 X-1, with twin X-
ray quasi-periodic oscillations, Pasham et al. 2014; CXO
J122518.6+144545, with possible recurrent outbursts,
Heida et al. 2015).

2012,

(e.g., Lin et al.

In our continuing eﬀort to classify X-ray sources
serendipitously detected by XMM-Newton and Chan-
2014), we discovered
dra
a possibly transient ultrasoft X-ray source 3XMM
J141711.1+522541 (XJ1417+52 hereafter) in the XMM-
Newton Serendipitous Source Catalog (the 3XMM-DR5
version, Rosen et al. 2015). The source was serendip-
itously detected in deep XMM-Newton and Chandra
observations of the Extended Groth Strip (EGS, e.g.,
Laird et al. 2009) in 2000–2002. We ruled it out as an
AGN in Lin et al. (2012) based on the ultrasoft X-ray
spectra. In this paper, we report the properties of this
source and argue that it is probably a wandering BH of
mass ∼105 M⊙ embedded in a compact stellar cluster

at a redshift of z = 0.41827 (the source luminosity dis-
tance is dL = 2.3 Gpc, assuming a ﬂat universe with
H0=70 km s−1 Mpc−1 and ΩM=0.3), with the outburst
due to disruption of a surrounding star. In Section 2, we
describe the analysis of multiwavelength data.
In Sec-
tion 3, we ﬁrst identify the host galaxy of our source and
the optical counterpart, followed by the presentation of
its detailed X-ray spectral and variability properties. We
discuss the nature of our source in Section 4 and give the
conclusions of our study in Section 5.

2. DATA ANALYSIS

2.1. XMM-Newton Observations

There were ﬁve XMM-Newton observations during
2000 July 20–24 that covered XJ1417+52 at oﬀ-axis an-
gles of about 3.′4. We analyzed all of them and found
that only two have enough counts from clean exposures
for careful spectral modeling; they are referred to as X1
and X2 (Table 1). The other three (observation IDs:
127920401, 0127920901, and 0127921101) have clean ex-
posure times of <10 ks after high background ﬁlter-
ing (see below) and have <10 net counts in each Eu-
ropean Photon Imaging Cameras (EPIC) camera. We
will not present these observations further in this study,
but we note that the source was detected in these obser-
vations, with ﬂuxes consistent with X1 and X2, based on
the 3XMM-DR5 catalog. We also performed an XMM-
Newton follow-up observation (X3 hereafter, see Table 1)
of XJ1417+52 on 2014 January 5. XJ1417+52 was not
clearly detected in this observation, and we use it to con-
strain the long-term evolution of the source.

The source was in the ﬁeld of view (FOV) of all
the three EPIC cameras (i.e., pn, MOS1, and MOS2,
Jansen et al. 2001; Str¨uder et al. 2001; Turner et al.
2001) in the imaging mode in both X1 and X2, but in
X3, only MOS1 and MOS2 were collecting science data.
We used SAS 14.0.0 to analyze the observations. We
ﬁrst reprocessed the X-ray event ﬁles with the calibration
ﬁles of 2015 July. We excluded the data in strong back-
ground ﬂare intervals following the SAS thread for the
ﬁltering against high backgrounds, i.e., excluding all in-
tervals when the background exceeded the low and steady
level15. Short ﬂares were seen in X1 in all cameras, each
for ∼1% of the time. Flares were absent in X2 in all cam-
eras. Short ﬂares also occurred in X3 in both MOS1 and
MOS2, each for 5% of the time. The ﬁnal clean exposure
times used are listed in Table 1. We extracted the source
spectra from all available cameras using a circular re-
gion of radius 15′′, corresponding to a point spread func-
tion (PSF) enclosing fraction of ∼70%. The background
spectra were extracted from a large circular region of ra-
dius 60′′–100′′ near the source. For the event selection
criteria, we used the default values in the pipeline (see
Table 5 in Watson et al. 2009). We also created the re-
sponse ﬁles, which were used for spectral ﬁts for X1 and
X2 and to estimate the ﬂux for X3. To check the short-
term variability in X1 and X2, we extracted the MOS1
background-corrected light curves in the 0.2–1 keV band
(negligible counts above 1 keV) and binned at 6 ks using
the SAS tool epiclccorr. We note that in both X1 and X2
our source was coincident with a dark column in MOS2

corrected for PSF loss. All upper limits were calculated with the CIAO task aprates, which adopts the Bayesian approach.

and a bright column in pn, resulting in signiﬁcant loss of
counts after ﬁltering out these columns.

Although the 3XMM-DR5 catalog provides an as-
trometrically corrected position for the source using
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR9 catalog
(Abazajian et al. 2009) as the reference, we double-check
the astrometric correction using the deep optical obser-
vations of the EGS by the Advanced Camera for Sur-
veys (ACS) Wide Field Camera (WFC) on the Hub-
ble Space Telescope (HST ) and MegaPrime/MegaCam
(Boulade et al. 2003) on the Canada-France-Hawaii Tele-
scope (CFHT). We started with the source detections in
the 3XMM-DR5 catalog for all ﬁve observations in 2000
(i.e., including the three observations not analyzed in
detail in this paper). The source detection in the XMM-
Newton catalog used a maximum likelihood ﬁtting pro-
cedure (Watson et al. 2009; Rosen et al. 2015). We ﬁrst
aligned all X-ray observations to the longest observa-
tion, i.e., X1, using the astrometric correction method
described in Appendix A (it is used for all astrometric
corrections throughout the paper), using sources with
95% positional uncertainties <2′′. The uncertainties of
the X-ray positions include both the statistical compo-
nent and a possible systematic component of 0.′′37 (1σ in
R.A. and Decl., Rosen et al. 2015). After the relative as-
trometry correction, the average X-ray source positions
weighted by the uncertainties were obtained and then
matched to the optical sources in the HST /ACS/WFC
F814W images from the All-Wavelength Extended Groth
Strip International Survey (Davis et al. 2007) and the
MegaPrime/MegaCam i′-band images from the CFHT
Legacy Survey (CFHTLS, Gwyn 2012), which were
matched to the SDSS astrometry. Only X-ray sources
with 95% positional uncertainties <1′′ were used for
the astrometric correction; the uncertainties of optical
sources should be small and were assumed to be 0.′′1 (1σ)
in R.A. and Decl. We note that XJ1417+52 was excluded
from the matches used for astrometric correction in this

step, in order to reduce the eﬀect of the astrometric cor-
rection on the identiﬁcation of its optical counterpart.

2.2. Chandra Observation

XJ1417+52 was in the FOV of seven Chandra obser-
vations (C1–C7 hereafter; refer to Table 1), all using the
imaging array of the AXAF CCD Imaging Spectrom-
eter (ACIS; Bautz et al. 1998). C1–C5 were part of
the Chandra survey of the EGS (Laird et al. 2009), with
C1–C3 taken between 2002 August 11–21 and C4–C5
taken on 2005 October 15. Our source fell in the front-
illuminated chip I0 in C1–C3 with an oﬀ-axis angle of 5.′8
and in I2 in C4–C5 with an oﬀ-axis angle of 9.′1 (near the
CCD edge). C6 and C7 were our follow-up observations
of the source in 2014 September–October. The aim point
was chosen to be at the back-illuminated chip S3 because
our source had been ultrasoft. We applied the latest
calibration (CALDB 4.6.7) by reprocessing all the data
with the script chandra repro in the Chandra Interac-
tive Analysis of Observations (CIAO, version 4.7) pack-
age. We extracted source and background spectra from
circular regions and created the corresponding response
matrices for all observations using the script specextract.
The radii of the source regions in C1–C3, C4–C5, and
C6–C7 are 4.′′0, 7.′′0, and 1.′′2 (Table 1), corresponding to
PSF enclosing fractions of 90%, 70%, and 95% at 0.6 keV,
respectively. We used a source region of a smaller PSF
enclosing fraction for observations in which the source
has a larger oﬀ-axis angle, in order to reduce the back-
ground eﬀect, because the PSF of Chandra degrades sig-
niﬁcantly at large oﬀ-axis angles. A large background
region of radius 30′′ was used for all observations. Our
source was detected in C1–C3, but not in C4–C7. We
used combine spectra to combine the spectra of C1–C3
into a single spectrum for spectral ﬁtting, because these
observations are close in time and have very few source
counts (the total net source counts are 38 in 0.3–7.0 keV).
Similarly we combined the spectra of C4 and C5 into a

4

Lin et al.

single spectrum and the spectra of C6 and C7 into an-
other one. These combinations were to put a tighter
constraint on the limit of the source ﬂux in these obser-
vations, in which our source was not detected.

In order to determine the position of XJ1417+52
from C1–C3, in which the source was weakly detected,
we merged these observations after correcting the rela-
tive astrometry between them. The astrometric correc-
tion used sources detected with the CIAO wavelet-based
source detection tool wavdetect (Freeman et al. 2002),
which was applied to 0.5–7.0 keV count images binned
at the single sky pixel resolution (0.′′492). The exposure
maps were constructed at the corresponding monochro-
matic eﬀective energy, i.e., 2.3 keV (Evans et al. 2010).
The PSF maps used correspond to the 40% enclosed
counts fraction at 2.3 keV. Only sources with 95% posi-
tional uncertainties (based on Equation 12 of Kim et al.
2007) <2.′′0 were used for astrometric correction. C2 was
used as the astrometric reference. New aspect solution
ﬁles were created from the relative astrometric correc-
tion obtained and then applied to the event ﬁles for C1
and C3. The CIAO script merge obs was then used to
combine the event lists of C1–C3. The source detection
was then carried out on the merged observation twice.
The ﬁrst time was on the 0.5–7.0 keV count image to
detect sources and align the astrometry to that of op-
tical sources from HST /ACS/WFC F814W-band and
CFHTLS MegaPrime/MegaCam i′-band images, as we
did to obtain XMM-Newton position of our source. The
second time was on the 0.3–1.0 keV count image (the ex-
posure and PSF maps at 0.6 keV were used) to obtain
the position of XJ1417+52, considering that our source
was ultrasoft.
In order to calculate the statistical po-
sitional uncertainty for our source, we carried out 2000
ray-trace simulations with MARX 5.1.0 at positions near
it and at the same oﬀ-axis angle. The spectrum from the
multicolor disk (MCD) ﬁt to C1–C3 (Section 3.2) was
assumed.

2.3. The Hubble Space Telescope Images

There are two images (in two ﬁlters: F606W and
F814W) taken by the HST /ACS/WFC on 2004 Decem-
ber 15 in the ﬁeld of our X-ray source. Each image
has four frames of 525 seconds each. As will be shown
later in Section 3.1, these images indicate that our source
has a candidate host galaxy SDSS J141711.07+522540.8
(GJ1417+52 hereafter) with extent ∼4′′ and a very
faint candidate optical counterpart (sGJ1417+52 here-
after) at a ∼1′′ oﬀset from the nucleus.
In order to
derive their main photometric parameters, we ﬁtted
the HST /ACS/WFC images using GALFIT (Peng et al.
2010) with multiple S´ersic components (convolved with
the PSF) for the galaxy and a PSF model for the faint
optical source, which seems unresolved in these images.
In order to improve the statistics, especially for the faint
source sGJ1417+5, the ﬁts used 5′′ × 5′′ (centered at the
center of the galaxy) stacked images (one for each ﬁlter)
from aligned and bundled16 FLC frames. The eﬀective
PSFs17 at the position of our source in the four frames
were averaged and used to ﬁt the stacked images. Be-

cause of dithering in the observations, diﬀerent frames
had diﬀerent degrees of distortion at the position of our
source, causing some problem in stacking them. How-
ever, we found that the ﬁts to single frames with the
corresponding PSFs gave similar results.

2.4. The Gemini Spectroscopic Observation

The galaxy GJ1417+52 was observed during the night
of 2013 February 8 (UT) with the Gemini Multi-Object
Spectrograph (GMOS, Hook et al. 2004) at the Gemini
North Telescope, in queue mode (program ID GN-2013A-
Q-37). The data were acquired during dark time (illumi-
nation fraction 0.8%), under photometric conditions and
∼0.′′70 seeing. The 400 lines/mm ruling density grat-
ing (R400) centered at 7000 ˚A was used. We chose a
slit of width 0.′′75 and put it through the center of the
galaxy GJ1417+52 and the source sGJ1417+52 in order
to obtain their spectra simultaneously. A total of four
exposures of 1500 seconds each were obtained. Small oﬀ-
sets in the spectral direction (50 ˚A) towards the blue and
the red were applied between exposures to allow for the
gaps between CCDs to avoid any loss of important lines
present in the spectra. Spectroscopic ﬂats and compar-
ison lamp (CuAr) spectra were taken after each science
exposure. In addition, to derive the sensitivity function
and ﬂux calibrate the science spectrum, the spectropho-
tometric standard star G191B2B was observed as part of
the baseline calibration provided by the observation. Be-
cause the standard star was observed on a diﬀerent night
(2013 March 03 UT) and under diﬀerent observing con-
ditions, the science spectrum was calibrated in relative
ﬂux.

We processed the observations and extracted the spec-
trum for the galaxy GJ1417+52 following the standard
procedures for long-slit observations provided by the
Gemini/GMOS package in IRAF. In summary, the sci-
ence exposures, comparison lamps and spectroscopic ﬂats
were bias subtracted and trimmed. Spectroscopic ﬂats
were then processed to remove the calibration unit plus
GMOS spectral response, normalizing and leaving only
pixel-to-pixel variations and fringing. The bias sub-
tracted, ﬂat ﬁelded two-dimensional science spectra were
then wavelength calibrated and rectiﬁed (S-shape dis-
tortions removed), sky-subtracted, extracted to a one-
dimensional format using a ﬁxed aperture of 1.′′2 in width
around the center of the galaxy, and average combined.
The ﬁnal spectrum of the galaxy has a resolution of
∼5.5 ˚A FWHM (measured using sky lines at ∼7000 ˚A), a
dispersion of ∼1.36 ˚A pixel−1, and a signal-to-noise ratio
about 40 at 7000 ˚A, covering a wavelength interval from
∼4850 ˚A to 9180 ˚A. We identiﬁed the most prominent
absorption lines (as no clear emission lines were detected)
in the spectrum and derived the redshift by employing
a line-by-line Gaussian ﬁt using the rvidline routine in
the IRAF RV package. We ﬁtted the spectrum to multi-
component models comprised of single-population syn-
thetic spectra, using Penalized Pixel Fitting (pPXF) soft-
ware (Cappellari & Emsellem 2004) and Vazdekis et al.
(2010) synthetic spectra spanning a grid of 24 ages be-
tween 1 to 14 Gyr and 6 metallicities [M/H]={−1.71,
−1.31, −0.71, −0.40, 0.00, +0.22}.

The source sGJ1417+52 is very faint and has strong
contamination from the extended emission of the galaxy,

cross, R.A.= 14:17:11.076, Decl.=+52:25:40.80). The angular scale of GJ1417+52 is 5.5 kpc/1′′. The image is false-colored, using the F814W

and Decl.=+52:25:41.74. The 95% positional error (0.′′73) of XJ1417+52 from the XMM-Newton observations is marked as a red dashed
circle, and that (0.′′86) from the Chandra observations as a green dotted circle, both indicating that the faint optical source could be the
counterpart to our X-ray source.

and our Gemini observation is only useful for searching
for strong emission lines from it. We followed a method
similar to Soria et al. (2013) for ESO 243-49 HLX-1 to
obtain a galaxy subtracted spectrum for this source. We
ﬁrst aligned and stacked the sky background subtracted
2D spectra from the four exposures. The galaxy emission
was then modeled and subtracted by ﬁtting a third-order
cubic spline function along the spatial direction on the
northern half of the galaxy, excluding 6 pixels (∼0.′′9)
centered around sGJ1417+52.

3. RESULTS

3.1. The Source Position and the Environment

R.A.=14:17:11.11,

Decl.=+52:25:42.0,

The positions of XJ1417+52 that we obtained
from the XMM-Newton and Chandra observations
are
and
(R.A.=14:17:11.04, Decl.+52:25:41.9, with the 95%
uncertainties of 0.′′73 and 0.′′86, respectively. They are
separated by 0.′′67 but are consistent with each other
within the uncertainties. The XMM-Newton position
that we obtained is only 0.′′16 from that given in the
3XMM-DR5 catalog, and thus they are also consistent
with each other within the uncertainties. We show
the HST/ACS/WFC F606W and F814W false-colored
image in the ﬁeld of XJ1417+52 in Figure 1, with the
X-ray positions above denoted. Our source is close to
GJ1417+52, which seems to be an S0 galaxy. However,

6

Lin et al.

neither of the X-ray positions is consistent with the
galaxy center within the 95% uncertainties.
Instead,
both X-ray positions are consistent with a faint but
clearly visible optical source (i.e., sGJ1417+52, pointed
to by a green arrow in Figure 1) in the northern part of
the galaxy within the 95% uncertainties. Based on the
HST observations of the EGS, we calculated the chance
probability for our X-ray source to be within ∼1.′′0 of the
center of a galaxy similar to or brighter than GJ1417+52
in the F814W band to be 0.03%. Similarly, based on
the density of optical sources as bright as or brighter
than sGJ1417+52 in the F814W band, we calculated
the chance probability for sGJ1417+52 to be within
∼1.′′0 of our X-ray source is 5%. These probabilities are
relatively low and allow us to conclude that XJ1417+52
is most likely in GJ1417+52, with sGJ1417+52 being
the optical counterpart.

The results of our ﬁts to the HST/ACS/WFC images
of GJ1417+52 and sGJ1417+52 are given in Table 2.
We required three S´ersic components to ﬁt the galaxy,
and adding another component did not improve the ﬁt
signiﬁcantly. The ﬁts are good, with no clear large resid-
uals left. We added a PSF model in the ﬁts to check
whether a bright point source was present at the galaxy
center but saw no signiﬁcant improvement on the ﬁts ei-
ther; the central point source, if present, would be ∼4
mag fainter than the galaxy. Based on the sizes, in-
dices, and axis ratios, the ﬁrst and second S´ersic com-
ponents in Table 2 are probably the bulge and the disk,
respectively. The third one is much larger in size (ef-
fective radius Re ∼ 8 kpc) and could be a halo. The
galaxy has integrated magnitudes of mF 606W = 20.28
AB mag and mF 814W = 19.35 AB mag, and the opti-
cal source sGJ1417+52 has mF 606W = 26.33 AB mag
and mF 814W = 25.51 AB mag, thus about 6 mag fainter
than the galaxy. To put a constraint on the size of
sGJ1417+52, we tried to model it with a S´ersic proﬁle
(convolved with the PSF) instead of a single PSF. We
assumed an axis ratio of 1.0 and considered two possible
indices: n = 1.0 and 4.0. The 3σ upper limits of the
eﬀective radius Re were found to be 63 pc and 113 pc
for the F606W and F814W bands, respectively, in the
case of n = 1.0, and were 30 pc and 80 pc, respectively,
in the case of n = 4.0. The best-ﬁtting Re values were
consistent with zero (i.e., reduced to be a PSF) within
1σ in all cases.

The Gemini spectrum of the galaxy GJ1417+52 is
shown in Figure 2. The spectrum exhibits no clear emis-
sion lines, but has typical absorption features indicating
a passive galaxy at a redshift of z = 0.41827 ± 0.00011
(DL = 2.3 Gpc). We estimated the 3σ upper limit of
the ﬂux of [O III] λ5007 to be 3.6 × 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2,
which corresponds to a luminosity of 2.3 × 1039 erg s−1
after Galactic extinction correction. Applying the bolo-
metric correction factors from the [O III] λ5007 ﬂux in
Lamastra et al. (2009), we obtained the 3σ upper limit of
the bolometric luminosity of the persistent nuclear activ-
ity to be 2.0 × 1041 erg s−1. We note that the MMT had
spectroscopic follow-up on the X-ray sources in the EGS
in 2007–2008, with GJ1417+52 being one of the targets.
The spectrum has much lower quality than the Gemini
one, with the upper limit of the ﬂux of [O III] λ5007 es-
timated to be much higher (4.8 × 10−17 erg s−1 cm−2,

2σ, Yan et al. 2011), but Coil et al. (2009) obtained a
redshift (z = 0.4184) consistent with our results.

The pPXF ﬁtting results are shown in Figure 2. The
light-weighted age is 8.4 Gyr, while the mass-weighted
age is 9.4 Gyr. The total mass is ∼4.1 × 1011 M⊙, and
the total luminosity within the ﬁtting band (source rest-
frame 3541-6479 ˚A) is ∼2.8 × 1010 L⊙, after rescaling the
spectrum to match the integrated F814W ﬂux to correct
for the slit loss and the calibration uncertainty.

The ﬁt implied a stellar velocity dispersion of σ⋆ ∼
247 km s−1. Using the relation between MBH and σ⋆ in
G¨ultekin et al. (2009), we inferred MBH ∼ 4.0 × 108 M⊙
(the 1σ uncertainty is 0.31 dex). We also estimated
the central BH mass of the galaxy based on the BH
mass versus bulge rest-frame K-band luminosity relation
(Graham 2007; Marconi & Hunt 2003). The K band in
the source rest frame is approximately the Wide-ﬁeld In-
frared Survey Explorer (WISE) W 1 band (Wright et al.
2010) in the observer frame for GJ1417+52, which has a
magnitude of mW 1 = 15.7 mag (MW 1 = −25.7 mag).
Thus we alternatively estimated the BH mass to be
∼ 3.1×108 M⊙ (the 1σ uncertainty is 0.33 dex), assuming
the bulge-to-total luminosity ratio of 35% obtained from
the ﬁts to the HST F814W image above. The above two
estimates of the central BH mass agree with each other
very well.

At the redshift of GJ1417+52, the source sGJ1417+52
has a projected oﬀset of ∼5.2 kpc from the nucleus of
the galaxy. We did not ﬁnd any continuum emission, as
expected considering that it is so faint, or any signiﬁ-
cant emission line from its galaxy subtracted 2D spec-
trum at any wavelength covered by our Gemini obser-
vation (∼4850 ˚A to 9180 ˚A). We ﬁtted its HST F606W
and F814W photometry with the Maraston (2005) stel-
lar population model that is based on theoretical at-
mospheres with the Salpeter initial mass function. We
adopted this model considering its broad wavelength cov-
erage as needed here. We assumed a single population
with a solar metallicity and a Galactic reddening value of
E(B − V ) = 0.039 mag (Schlegel et al. 1998, the intrin-
sic reddening is neglected considering that the absorption
inferred from X-ray spectral ﬁts is consistent with zero).
The redshift of z = 0.41827 was applied. We inferred a
stellar population of age 0.8 Gyr and bolometric lumi-
nosity 2.3 × 1042 erg s−1 (or 5.9 × 108 L⊙, corresponding
to 5.9 × 107 M⊙).
If we assume a systematic error of
0.1 mag in our derivation of the photometry, the 90%
upper limit of the age would be 3 Gyr. Assuming at this
age, the bolometric luminosity would be 2.4 × 1042 erg
s−1 (or 6.4 × 108 L⊙, corresponding to 7.8 × 108 M⊙).
With photometric information in two ﬁlters only, we can-
not test multiple stellar population models. Considering
that sGJ1417+52 has a F606W−F814W color similar to
GJ1417+52, we cannot rule out that sGJ1417+52 con-
tains multiple stellar populations, with mass dominated
by old populations.

3.2. X-ray Spectral Modeling

We carried out spectral ﬁts for X1, X2 and C1–C3.
Because of their poor statistics, we rebinned the source
spectra to have a minimum of one count per bin and
adopted the C statistic to ﬁt the source and background
spectra simultaneously. We ﬁtted over the 0.2–10 keV

Fig. 2.— (Upper panel) Relative ﬂux calibrated Gemini spectrum (black) of the host galaxy of XJ1417+52 versus the source rest-frame
wavelength, with the best-ﬁtting pPXF model (red) and residuals (green/blue) overplotted. The two drops at around 4844 ˚A and 5360
˚A (corresponding to 6870 ˚A and 7604 ˚A, respectively, in the observer frame; indicated by the blue residuals), are due to the atmospheric
OH absorption and were excluded in the ﬁt. The spectrum bluer than 3541 ˚A was not ﬁtted because the stellar models do not cover this
wavelength range. Important stellar absorption and AGN diagnostic emission lines are denoted for reference. For clarity, we have smoothed
data points with a boxbar function with width 5 pixels for clarity. (Lower panel) Relative mass fractions of diﬀerent stellar populations

and 0.3–8 keV energy bands for XMM-Newton and Chan-
dra spectra, respectively. As our source is most likely as-
sociated with GJ1417+52 at z = 0.41827 (Section 3.1),
instead of being a foreground source (see discussion in
Section 4), we applied this redshift to the spectral models
using the convolution model zashift in XSPEC, unless in-
dicated otherwise. All models included the Galactic ab-
sorption of NH = 1.1 × 1020 cm−2 (Kalberla et al. 2005)
using the tbabs model. Possible absorption intrinsic to
the source was also taken into account using the ztbabs
model. We used the abundance tables of Wilms et al.
(2000). The uncertainties of the parameters from the
spectral ﬁts are all at the 90% conﬁdence level through-

out the paper.

The X-ray spectra are ultrasoft, with little emission
above 1 keV. When we ﬁtted the spectra with a power
law (PL), we obtained unphysically high photon indices
of ΓPL = 7.5±1.2, 7.0±2.1, and 5.3+2.2
−0.7, respectively, im-
plying the thermal origin of the spectra. Therefore, we
ﬁtted the spectra with a single-temperature blackbody
(BB, bbodyrad in XSPEC) model and an MCD model
(diskbb in XSPEC). The ﬁtting results are given in Ta-
ble 3, and the example MCD ﬁts to X1 and C1–C3 are
shown in Figure 3. The source rest-frame temperatures
are in the range of kTBB ∼ 0.11–0.14 keV from the BB
ﬁts and in the range of kTMCD ∼ 0.13–0.17 keV from

Note. — aThe three S´ersic components were used to ﬁt the galaxy GJ1417+52
(their centers were consistent with each other and were thus forced to be the same in
the ﬁnal ﬁts), and the PSF was used to ﬁt the faint optical source sGJ1417+52. bThe
pixel scale is 0.′′05 (i.e., 0.28 kpc). cThe position angle is from the north to the east.

X1. The strength of the soft excess Rexc, measured by the
ratio of unabsorbed 0.3–2 keV (source rest-frame) ﬂux
in the MCD and PL components, is >61 (the 90% lower
limit) and ∼34 for X1 and C1–C3, respectively, which are
much higher than those of ultrasoft AGNs (Rexc . 17,
Gierli´nski & Done 2004). We will describe the source
luminosities from these spectral ﬁts in Section 3.3.

For easy comparison with Galactic sources, we also ﬁt-
ted the spectra assuming the X-ray source to be in our
Galaxy. Adopting an absorbed BB model, we obtained
kTBB = 79 ± 8 eV, 85 ± 14 eV, and 99 ± 18 eV, for X1,
X2, and C1–C3, respectively. The corresponding 0.3–
10 keV unabsorbed luminosities are 2.8+1.1
−0.6 × 1030d2 erg
s−1, 2.2+2.0
−0.6 × 1030d2 erg s−1, and 5.2+4.3
−1.7 × 1029d2 erg
s−1, where d is the source distance in units of kpc, re-
spectively. Therefore the source would be very faint if it
is in our Galaxy. The best-ﬁtting column densities are
NH = 1.0+2.2 × 1020 cm−2, 0.5+4.7 × 1020 cm−2, and
0.0+6.2 × 1020 cm−2 (the lower error bounds of NH are
all zeros), respectively.

3.3. The Long-term and Short-term X-ray Variability

Figure 4 shows the long-term rest-frame 0.28–14.2
keV (observer-frame 0.2–10 keV) unabsorbed luminos-
ity LX curve of XJ1417+52. The luminosities were ob-
tained based on the MCD ﬁts (Section 3.2) and assuming
DL = 2.3 Gpc (Section 3.1); for observations in which the
source was not detected, the 3σ upper limits were esti-
mated based on the MCD ﬁt to the X1 spectrum. The
source was ﬁrst detected in X1 and X2 in 2000 July, with
LX = 3.8+3.1
−1.1 × 1043 erg s−1,
respectively. The source was still detected in C1–C3 in
2002 August, with LX = 0.5+0.7
−0.2 × 1043 erg s−1, a factor
of ∼ 7 lower than that in X1. The source was not de-
tected in C4–C5, X3, and C6–C7, with LX < 0.9 × 1043
erg s−1, < 1.1 × 1043 erg s−1, and < 0.25 × 1043 erg s−1,
respectively. Therefore it appears that the source was
experiencing an outburst in 2000–2002, with the X-ray
luminosity decreasing by a factor of >14 in C6–C7 from
X1.

−1.4 × 1043 erg s−1 and 2.7+8.5

Figure 5 shows the light curves from X1, X2, and C1–
C3. The temporal bin sizes used are relatively large
(6 ks for X1 and X2 and 28 ks for C1–C3) due to the
poor statistics of all observations. Short-term variability

the MCD ﬁts. Although it seems that the best-ﬁtting
temperature is a little lower in X1 than in C1–C3 (e.g.,
kTMCD = 0.13 ± 0.02 keV versus 0.17 ± 0.04 keV), they
are consistent within the 90% uncertainties. The slightly
higher best-ﬁtting temperature in C1–C3 from the BB
and MCD ﬁts could be due to presence of some very
weak hard emission above 1 keV in these observations.
When we tried to ﬁt X1 and C1–C3 spectra with an
MCD plus a PL, with the photon index ﬁxed at 2.0, we
obtained a zero PL normalization for X1 and a non-zero
PL normalization for C1–C3 but only at the 90% signif-
icance level. The best-ﬁtting disk temperature becomes
kTMCD = 0.15±0.04 keV for C1–C3, thus closer to that of

out that our X-ray source is embedded in a globular
cluster that is much smaller than sGJ1417+52 and can-
not be detected in the HST images. We have viewed
sGJ1417+52 as the most likely, interesting counterpart
to our X-ray source, because its large size makes it more
likely to host a large BH of ∼ 105 M⊙.

If XJ1417+52 is really a massive BH embedded in the
remnant nucleus of a dwarf satellite galaxy, one expla-
nation for the outburst is the tidal disruption of a sur-

might be present in X1 and C2 but is not signiﬁcant.
The probability that the source is not variable is 52% for
X1.

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. The Wandering Massive BH Explanation

Both the Chandra and XMM-Newton positions indi-
cate that our X-ray source XJ1417+52 could be associ-
ated with the galaxy GJ1417+52, with an oﬀset of ∼1′′
from the galaxy nucleus. Therefore, it is an HLX candi-
date, with the peak luminosity of LX = 3.8×1043 erg s−1
in X1. The source could be an accreting wandering BH
of mass ∼ 105 M⊙, assuming that it was at the Ed-
dington limit in X1. This mass is around the boundary
between IMBHs and SMBHs. The temperature at the in-
ner radius in a standard thin disk at a given Eddington
ratio is expected to depend on the BH mass as M −1/4
BH ,
and Galactic BHBs tend to have kTMCD ∼ 1 keV in
the bright thermal state (Remillard & McClintock 2006;
Done et al. 2007). Therefore, our explanation of the
source as a BH of mass ∼ 105 M⊙ is supported by its
very soft X-ray spectra of kTMCD ∼ 0.1–0.2 keV.

Our source has a faint optical counterpart candidate
sGJ1417+52.
It appears somewhat red in the opti-
cal and is thus unlikely to be the emission from ac-
cretion activity.
It has a rest-frame absolute V -band
(close to the observer-frame F814W band) magnitude
of ∼−15.9 AB mag and is thus much more luminous
than globular clusters (MV & −13 AB mag, refer to,
e.g., Sivakoﬀ et al. 2007). However, it is consistent with
a compact dwarf satellite galaxy, which is reminiscent
of M32 in M31.
It might have been tidally stripped
by GJ1417+52, resulting in the remnant nucleus. A
possible merging/interacting signature could be that the
outer/halo component of GJ1417+52 is a little twisted
toward sGJ1417+52, compared with the inner compo-

rounding star by the BH. Fundamental theory predicts
the mass accretion rate in TDEs to follow a (t − tD)−5/3
decay, where tD is the disruption time (Rees 1988, 1990).
Because our source was only detected in two epochs (2000
July and 2002 August), we cannot test whether its lu-
minosity decay followed this relation.
In Figure 4, we
plot a t−5/3 decay curve that passes through the X1 and
C1–C3 data points and implies tD to be ∼11 months be-
fore X1. This decay curve predicts much lower ﬂuxes in
the observations after C1–C3 than the detection limits,
explaining the non-detection of our source in those ob-
servations. Hydrodynamical simulations predicted that
the mass accretion rate in TDEs might decay faster than
t−5/3 (Guillochon & Ramirez-Ruiz 2013). The disrupted
star is more likely to be a main-sequence star, instead
of a white dwarf (WD). This is because WD TDEs re-
quire smaller BHs (. 105 M⊙) for the disruption to be
outside the event horizon of the BH and should have
much shorter duration (. 1 yr, Rosswog et al. 2009)
than our event, which appeared to last for more than
two years. We note that the known candidate X-ray
TDEs are all associated with the nuclei of main galaxies,
and our source could be the ﬁrst X-ray TDE discovered
to be in the nucleus of a stripped satellite galaxy. One
oﬀ-nuclear optical TDE candidate has been reported in
Arcavi et al. (2014). Strong narrow emission lines were
not detected from sGJ1417+52 in our Gemini observa-
tion, which could be because the lines as echoes of the
X-ray ﬂare either had decayed signiﬁcantly a decade af-
ter the disruption or were too weak to be detected, as is
often the case (Gezari et al. 2003).

Our source had a peak X-ray luminosity one order
of magnitude higher than that of ESO 243-49 HLX-1
and two orders of magnitude higher than those of other
HLXs. Its distance is also one order of magnitude larger

than those of other HLXs (2.3 Gpc for our source versus
<200 Mpc for others). Therefore our source could be the
most luminous and the most distant HLX candidate ever
discovered. It is the only HLX candidate other than ESO
243-49 HLX-1 showing very soft X-ray spectra and with
an early-type host (both are S0 galaxies). ESO 243-49
HLX-1 also has an optical counterpart, with a projected
oﬀset of 3.3 kpc from the nucleus of ESO 243-49, thus
similar to our source, but it appeared blue, unlike the op-
tical counterpart to our X-ray sources, which appeared
relatively red. The nature of the optical counterpart
to ESO 243-49 HLX-1 is still somewhat under debate
and could be a very young (∼ 20 Myr) stellar cluster
with a mass of ∼105 M⊙, with additional contribution
from disk irradiation at long wavelengths (Farrell et al.
2012, 2014). The scenario of the remnant nucleus of a
bulgy or bulgeless satellite galaxy tidally stripped by
ESO 243-49 has also been carefully explored through
N -body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations
(Mapelli et al. 2013b,a). The optical counterpart to our
source is much more massive (by about two orders of
magnitude) and much older (though still younger than
typical red globular clusters) and is more likely to be the
remnant nucleus of a tidally stripped bulgy dwarf galaxy.
ESO 243-49 HLX-1 showed quasi-periodic (∼1 yr) out-
bursts (Godet et al. 2014), thus unlikely due to complete
tidal disruption of a star in a single passage. Our source
is consistent with a transient due to a TDE, but with the
sparse coverage of the source, we cannot completely rule
out the recurrent nature of the source.

4.2. Alternative Explanations

Because of its close proximity to GJ1417+52, the rel-
atively large positional uncertainties of our X-ray source
from Chandra and XMM-Newton observations allow us
to rule out that it is due to the nuclear activity (either

as a standard AGN or a TDE) in GJ1417+52 only at
the 95% conﬁdence level. However, there are other argu-
ments against the explanation as an AGN/TDE at the
nucleus of GJ1417+52. We did not identify XJ1417+52
as an AGN (either in GJ1417+52 or in the background)
in Lin et al. (2012), because none of the 753 AGNs in
that study has X-ray spectra as soft as XJ1417+52. The
large long-term variability factor (>14) of XJ1417+52
found here is not common in AGNs either; only 1.5%
of the 753 AGNs in Lin et al. (2012) varied by factors
of >10. The AGN explanation is also disfavored based
on the lack of the [O III] λ5007 in the Gemini spec-
trum, which indicates little persistent nuclear activity in
GJ1417+52, at least two orders of magnitude lower than
the peak X-ray luminosity of our source. XJ1417+52 is
unlikely a TDE at the nucleus of GJ1417+52 because
the central BH of this galaxy is probably too massive
(&108M⊙) to disrupt a solar-type star outside the event
horizon (Rees 1988).

The high X-ray luminosities and ultrasoft X-ray
spectra, which probably lasted for &2 years, make
XJ1417+52 unlikely to be the X-ray afterglow of a γ-
ray burst (GRB) or a supernova (SN), following simi-
lar arguments that we applied to a TDE candidate in
Lin et al. (2015). Essentially, X-ray spectra of the after-
glows of GRBs and SNs are generally hard, with ΓPL .2
(Immler 2007; Levan et al. 2013; Grupe et al. 2013). Al-
though some ultralong GRBs were discovered to exhibit
very soft late-time X-ray spectra (e.g., Piro et al. 2014;
Margutti et al. 2015), their hosts normally show inten-
sive star forming activity (e.g., Levan et al. 2014), while
GJ1417+52 is an early-type galaxy. The long duration of
XJ1417+52 cannot be explained with the prompt shock
breakouts in SNe, which could show soft X-ray spectra
(Soderberg et al. 2008) but are expected to be short (less
than hours, Nakar & Sari 2012).

Lin et al. (2012) did not identify XJ1417+52 as a coro-
nally active star because it has a 0.2–12 keV maximum
ﬂux to the K-band ﬂux ratio of log(FX/FIR) > −0.65
(the lower limit was obtained because no counterpart
was found in the 2MASS K band), higher than seen
in coronally active stars (log(FX/FIR) . −0.9 in case
of no ﬂares). The X-ray spectra of XJ1417+52 are
much softer than seen in stars too. The 0.2–0.5 keV
to 0.5–1.0 keV hardness ratio is −0.55 ± 0.04 in X1,
signiﬁcantly lower than values of &0.3 seen in stars
(Lin et al. 2012). With highly variable ultrasoft X-ray
spectra, XJ1417+52 is similar to supersoft X-ray sources
(SSS), most of which are due to nuclear burning of the
hydrogen-rich matter on the surface of a WD in the so-
called close binary supersoft sources or supersoft novae
(Kahabka & van den Heuvel 2006; Greiner 2000). How-
ever, such objects are rare, with only a few tens found
in our Galaxy (Kahabka & van den Heuvel 2006; Greiner
2000) and the chance to ﬁnd one within 1′′ of the center
of a bright galaxy should be very small. Besides, these
objects have luminosities typically > 1036 erg s−1, while
our source has a bolometric luminosity of 6.3 × 1030 erg
s−1, based on a BB ﬁt (redshift set to zero) and assum-
ing a distance of 1 kpc. This assumption on the distance
is reasonable, given that our source is at a high Galactic

11

latitude of 60◦.

5. CONCLUSIONS

We have carried out a detailed study of the ultrasoft
X-ray source XJ1417+52, which is a candidate HLX in
the S0 galaxy GJ1417+52 at z = 0.41827 (dL = 2.3
Gpc) in the EGS with a projected oﬀset of ∼1.′′0 (5.2
kpc) from the nucleus. It was serendipitously detected
in ﬁve XMM-Newton observations in 2000 July. Two of
them (X1 and X2) have enough counts for detailed spec-
tral ﬁts and show very soft spectra that can be ﬁtted
with an MCD of kTMCD ∼ 0.13 keV and LX ∼ 4 × 1043
erg s−1 in the source rest frame.
It was still detected
in three Chandra observations (C1–C3) in 2002 August,
also exhibiting ultrasoft spectra of kTMCD ∼ 0.17 keV
but at a lower luminosity of LX ∼ 0.5 × 1043 erg s−1.
The source was not detected in later observations, with
LX < 0.9 × 1043 erg s−1 in C4–C5 in 2005 October,
LX < 1.1 × 1043 erg s−1 in X3 in 2014 January, and
LX < 0.25 × 1043 erg s−1 in C6–C7 in 2014 September–
October. Therefore the source has a long-term variation
factor of >14 and is likely a transient with an outburst
in 2000–2002. The source has a faint optical counter-
part candidate sGJ1417+52, which has mF606W = 26.33
AB mag and mF814W = 25.51 AB mag in the observer
frame in 2004 December, corresponding to the absolute
V -band magnitude of ∼−15.9 AB mag. All the proper-
ties of our source are consistent with a massive BH of
mass ∼ 105 M⊙ embedded in the remnant nucleus of a
satellite galaxy, with the outburst due to tidal disrup-
tion of a surrounding star by the BH. Alternative ex-
planations such as a standard AGN in GJ1417+52 and
Galactic SSSs are disfavored.

APPENDIX

ASTROMETRIC CORRECTION

We needed to either align X-ray sources in various observations or align X-ray sources and optical sources. We
adopted a two-step method to ﬁnd the translation and rotation needed for the astrometric correction, assuming that
all sources in the reference frame and sources to be aligned have positions and errors known. The ﬁrst step is to
ﬁnd the translation and rotation that maximize the number of matches Nmax within the 99.73% (i.e., 3σ) positional
uncertainty. The second step is to ﬁnd the translation and rotation that minimize the reduced χ2 (χ is deﬁned as the
separation of the matches divided by the total positional uncertainty) for f Nmax matches that have the smallest values
of χ. Here f represents the percentage of the matches used to calculate the χ2 and is adopted to exclude possible
spurious or bad matches. Bad matches can occur if one or both of the matched sources have bad positions for some
reason, like being too close to the CCD edge or being too close to other sources to be resolved well by the detection
tool. We have assumed f = 90% throughout the paper.

The translation and rotation obtained for the astrometric correction have uncertainties, increasing the positional
uncertainties of the aligned sources. We estimated the additional positional uncertainties of the aligned sources
associated with the astrometric correction procedure, based on 200 simulations. In each simulation, we ﬁrst simulated
the positions of the sources that have matches around the positions of the matches in the reference frame, with
positional uncertainties following the combined positional uncertainties from the reference frame and the frame to be
aligned. Then the χ2 minimization for the f Nmax matches that have the smallest values of χ was repeated. The
corrected positions for each source from the simulations are then used to calculate the uncertainty associated with the
astrometric correction, which is added to the original positional uncertainty of the source in quadrature.
