ON THE EXISTENCE OF A GYSIN MORPHISM FOR THE

BLOW-UP OF AN ORDINARY SINGULARITY

VINCENZO DI GENNARO AND DAVIDE FRANCO

Abstract. In this paper we characterize the Blowing-up maps of ordinary

singularities for which there exists a natural Gysin morphism, i.e. a bivariant
class θ ∈ HomD(Y )(Rπ∗QX , QY ), compatible with pullback and with restric-
tion to the complement of the singularity.

Keywords: Bivariant theory, Gysin morphism, Blowing-up, Derived category,
Borel-Moore Homology, Isolated singularities, Projective contractions.

To the memory of Sacha

1. Introduction

One of the problems that have most attracted Sacha Lascu’s interest throughout
his mathematical career, is the projective contractability of a smooth divisor inside
a smooth projective variety (see e.g. [15], [16] and [13]). In this paper we are aimed
at a topological problem closely related to this.

Consider a projective variety Y ⊆ PN (C) with an ordinary singularity ∞ ∈ Y ,

i.e. a singularity whose projective tangent cone G ⊆ PN −1 is smooth. Set

(1)

X := Bl∞(Y ) π−→ Y

the Blow-up at ∞. Of course, in this context we have a surjection of Chow groups

A•(X) −→ A•(Y ) −→ 0,

but very seldom it happens that the push-forward for rational homology groups

π∗ : H•(X; Q) −→ H•(Y ; Q)

is surjective too. The surjectivity of push-forward π∗ is closely related to the ex-
istence of some kind of Gysin map, i.e. a “wrong way”morphism between rational
homology groups

(2)

H•(Y ; Q) −→ H•(X; Q)

or, dually, between rational cohomology groups

(3)

H •(X; Q) −→ H •(X; Q).

The existence of natural morphisms like (2) or (3) had been extensively studied by
Fulton and MacPherson in [12], where it is introduced the concept of bivariant the-
ory. These are “simultaneous generalizations of covariant group valued homology-
like theories and contravariant ring valued cohomology-like theories”([12, p. v]).

f
→ Y in C a (usually graded) group T (X

A bivariant theory from a category C to abelian groups assigns to each morphism
f
→ Y ). Such an assignment must satisfy
X
appropriate axioms that ensure the existence of products, pullbacks and pushfor-
wards. When C is the category of complex algebraic varieties a Topological bivariant
theory can be deﬁned in such a way that [12, §7], [2]

T i(X

f
→ Y ) := HomD(Y )(Rf∗QX , QY [i]),

f
→ Y is a proper morphism of algebraic varieties, i ∈ Z, and D(Y ) is the

where X
bounded derived category of sheaves of Q-vector spaces on Y . An element

θ ∈ HomD(Y )(Rf∗QX , QY [i])

produces Gysin-like morphisms

H•(Y ; Q) −→ H•+i(X; Q), H •(X; Q) −→ H •−i(Y ; Q).

Such morphisms turn out to be deﬁned only for particular maps of algebraic vari-
eties. In particular, natural Gysin maps are deﬁned when the target Y is smooth
f
→ Y is either local complete intersection or ﬂat ([18, §4.5]). Unfor-
and when X
tunately, our map (1) is neither local complete intersection nor ﬂat, and in general
it does not admit a Gysin morphism. Nevertheless, in particular cases (see §4)
there is a Gysin morphism satisfying some natural conditions such as compatibility
with pullback and restriction to the complement of the singularity (compare with
Deﬁnition 2.3).

In this paper we prove a characterization of desingularizations like (1) admitting
a natural Gysin morphism (see Theorem 3.5). What it turns out is that there exists
a natural Gysin morphism if and only if we have a decomposition in D(Y ):

R π∗QX ≃ M

h≥0

Rhπ∗Q[−h].

Such a decomposition is very reminiscent of the Decomposition Theorem, as stated
e.g. in [3, Remark 1.6.2, (3)], and of the Laray-Hirsch Theorem (compare with the
proof of Lemma 2.5 in [9]). Furthermore, in the last section we will apply our main
result to some examples. We will see that, for any smooth projective hypersurface
G, one can construct examples of desingularizations having G as projective tangent
cone and admitting a natural Gysin morphism, as well as examples of desingu-
larizations having the same projective tangent cone and not admitting a natural
Gysin morphism (compare with Remark 4.2). So the existence of a natural Gysin
morphism is far from being a local property of the singularity.

One may ask whether our result holds true with Z-coeﬃcients. We have in mind

to return on this question in a future paper.

2. Notations

Notations 2.1.

(1) For any algebraic variety X we will denote by QX the con-
stant sheaf on X, by VX the category of sheaves of QX -modules, and by
D(X) the bounded derived category of VX .

(2) Consider a projective variety Y ⊆ PN with an ordinary singularity ∞ ∈ Y ,
i.e. a singularity whose projective tangent cone G ⊆ PN −1 is smooth. Set

X := Bl∞(Y ) π−→ Y

the Blow-up at ∞. Of course we have an inclusion X ⊆ Bl∞(PN ) and

i
֒→ X coincides with the exceptional divisor. Furthermore, we set

G

U
idl

U

j
→ X
↓ π
k→ Y.

where U := X − G = Y − {∞}.

(3) Since the morphism π : X −→ Y is proper, for any sheaf F ∈ VX the
direct image with proper support π!F ∈ VY [14, §2.6], [10, Deﬁnition 2.3.21]
coincides with the ordinary direct image π∗ F ∈ VY .

Remark 2.2. By deﬁnition of direct image with proper support ([14, §2.6], [10,
Deﬁnition 2.3.21]), the sheaf k!QU (j!QU resp.) can be identiﬁed with the subsheaf
of QY (of QX resp.) consisting of sections with support contained in U .

Deﬁnition 2.3. We will say that a graded morphism

θ : H •(X; Q) −→ H •(Y ; Q)

is natural if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(1) the composite of θ with the pullback

θ ◦ π∗ : H •(Y ; Q) −→ H •(Y ; Q)

is the identity map;

(2) θ is compatible with restrictions on U :

j∗ = k∗ ◦ θ : H •(X; Q) −→ H •(U ; Q).

Deﬁnition 2.4. Consider a (topological) bivariant class [12, §7], [2]

θ ∈ HomD(Y )(Rπ∗QX, QY ).

By abuse of notations, we also denote by θ the map induced by such a class on the
cohomology groups [12], [2]:

θ : H •(X; Q) −→ H •(Y ; Q).

According to Deﬁnition 2.3, we will say that θ deﬁnes a natural Gysin map if the
last morphism is natural.

VINCENZO DI GENNARO AND DAVIDE FRANCO

Lemma 2.5. Keep notations as above. Then pullbacks give isomorphisms

(4)

H h(Y ; Q) ≃ H h(Y, {∞}; Q) ≃ H h(X, G; Q), ∀h ≥ 1.

Assume additionally that there exists a natural morphism:

θ : H •(X; Q) −→ H •(Y ; Q).

Then the map

(5)

(θ, i∗) : H •(X; Q) −→ H •(Y ; Q) ⊕ H •(G; Q)

is an isomorphism of graded groups in degree ≥ 1.

Proof. The isomorphism H h(Y, {∞}; Q) ≃ H h(Y ; Q) follows from the long exact
sequence:

. . . −→ H h(Y, {∞}; Q) −→ H h(Y ; Q) −→ H h({∞}; Q) −→ . . .

As for the isomorphism

π∗ : H h(Y, {∞}; Q) ≃ H h(X, G; Q)

we are going to give two diﬀerent proofs.

Topological proof: consider a small open neighborhood ∞ ∈ B and set T :=
π−1(B). Of course T is a tubular neighborhood of G in X and we have ∂B ≃ ∂T .
Moreover, {∞} and G are tautly imbedded in Y and X [17, p. 289]. Hence we
have

H h(Y, {∞}; Q) ≃ H h(Y, B; Q) ≃ H h(Y − B, ∂B; Q)

≃ H h(X − T, ∂T ; Q) ≃ H h(X, T ; Q) ≃ H h(X, G; Q).

Sheaf theoretic proof: by [1, Theorem 12.1], [10, Remark 2.4.5, (ii)], and Remark

2.2, we have

H h(Y, {∞}; Q) ≃ H h(Y, k!QU ) = H h(Y, π!(j!QU ))

≃ H h(Y, π∗(j!QU )) ≃ H h(X, j!QU ) ≃ H h(X, G; Q).

In order to prove (5), look at the following long exact sequence:

. . . −→ H h(Y ; Q) ≃ H h(X, G; Q) −→ H h(X; Q) −→ H h(G; Q) −→ . . .

By Deﬁnition 2.3 (1), the map π∗ : H h(Y ; Q) −→ H h(X; Q) is injective ∀h ≥ 1, so
we have:

0 −→ H h(Y ; Q) −→ H h(X; Q) −→ H h(G; Q) −→ 0,

and we are done.

ON THE GYSIN MORPHISM FOR THE BLOW-UP OF AN ORDINARY SINGULARITY 5

3. The main result

Notations 3.1.

(1) Combining [14, I, Theorem 6.2] with [19, §7.3.2], we see that

the natural morphism QY −→ π∗QX in VY is induced by an element

ι0 ∈ HomD(Y )(QY , Rπ∗QX ).

(2) We denote by K • an injective resolution of QY .
(3) We denote by I • an injective resolution of QX . By [14, II, Corollary 4.13],
J • := π∗I • can be identiﬁed as the derived direct image Rπ∗QX in D(Y ).
So, when h ≥ 1, Rhπ∗QX = H h(J •) is the skyscraper sheaf supported on
∞, with stalk at ∞ given by H h(G; Q). Furthermore, the morphism ι0
deﬁned in (1) can be seen as an element in [K •, J •].

We prove the following result which will be needed throughout the paper (com-

pare with [4, Proposition 1.2]).

Proposition 3.2. Assume that, for any h ≥ 1, the identity map Rhπ∗QX −→
Rhπ∗QX lifts to a morphism ιh ∈ HomD(Y )(Rhπ∗QX , Rπ∗QX[h]). Then we have
an isomorphism in D(Y ):

M

h≥0

ιh : QY + X

h≥1

Rhπ∗QX [−h] ←→ Rπ∗QX .

Proof. The above morphism is well deﬁned by 3.1, (1). With notations as in 3.1,
(2) and (3), we have an isomorphism

Q = Ker(Γ(K 0) → Γ(K 1)) −→ Ker(Γ(J 0) → Γ(J 1)) = Q.

Furthermore, the complex Rhπ∗QX[h] is injective ∀h ≥ 1, because Rhπ∗QX is a
skyscraper sheaf. So we have

QY + X

h≥1

Rhπ∗QX [−h] = K • + X

h≥1

Rhπ∗QX [−h]

in D(Y ). We are done because our hypothesis implies that

H h 

K • + X

h≥1

Rhπ∗QX [−h]

 = H h(J •) ∀h,

therefore the map Lh≥0 ιh is a quasi-isomorphism.
Remark 3.3. By [4, Proposition 1.2], the hypothesis of Proposition 3.2 is equivalent
to the fact that, for any cohomological functor T from VY to an abelian category,
the spectral sequence

(cid:3)

Epq

2 = T (Rqπ∗QX [p]) ⇒ RT (π∗QX[p + q])

degenerates at Epq
2 .

Proposition 3.4. Assume that there exists a natural morphism

H •(X; Q) −→ H •(Y ; Q).

Then the hypothesis of Proposition 3.2 is satisﬁed, i.e. the identity map Rhπ∗QX →
Rhπ∗QX lifts to a morphism ιh ∈ HomD(Y )(Rhπ∗QX, Rπ∗QX [h]) for any h ≥ 1.

6

VINCENZO DI GENNARO AND DAVIDE FRANCO

Proof. Keep notations as in 3.1. Set Γ• := Γ(J •) and denote by dh : Γh → Γh+1 the
diﬀerential. Then we have H h(X; Q) = H h(Γ•), and by hypothesis any element of
H h(G; Q) can be lifted to an element γ ∈ Ker dh. We claim that any α ∈ H h(G, Q)
can be lifted to an element β ∈ Ker dh ⊂ Γ(J h) = Γ(I h) which is supported on
∞. Of course, to prove our claim amounts to show that any α ∈ H h(G; Q) can be
lifted to an element β ∈ Ker dh ⊂ Γ(J h) = Γ(I h) such that β |U = 0 ∈ Γ(J h |U ).
But γ |U projects to a cohomology class living in Im(H h(X; Q) → H h(U ; Q)). By
(2) of Deﬁnition 2.3, we have

Im(H h(X; Q) → H h(U ; Q)) ⊆ Im(H h(Y ; Q) → H h(U ; Q)).

By Lemma 2.5, we ﬁnd

Im(H h(Y ; Q) → H h(U ; Q)) = Im(H h(X, G; Q) → H h(U ; Q)).

Since

H h(Y, k!QU ) ≃ H h(Y, ∞; Q) ≃ H h(X, G; Q) ≃ H h(X, j!QU )

([1, Theorem 12.1], [10, Remark 2.4.5, (ii)]), Remark 2.2 implies that there exists
δU ∈ Γ(J h−1 |U ) and σ ∈ Γ(J h) supported in U such that

γ |U −dh−1(δU ) = σ |U .

Finally, there exists δ ∈ Γ(J h−1) with δ |U = δU , because J h−1 is injective (hence
ﬂabby). We conclude that the section

γ − σ − dh−1(δ) ∈ Γ(J h)

is supported on ∞. Our claim is proved because σ + dh−1(δ) ∈ Γ(J h) vanishes in
H h(G; Q).

To conclude the proof, ﬁx a basis αr ∈ H h(G; Q) and lift any αr to a βr ∈
Ker dh ⊆ Γ(J h) = Γ(I h) as in the claim. We get an isomorphism between H h(G; Q)
and a subspace of Γ(I h) consisting of sections supported on ∞. We are done because
such an isomorphism projects to a monomorphism of sheaves:

Rhπ∗QX ֒→ Ker (J h → J h+1).

(cid:3)

Theorem 3.5. Keep notations as above. Then the following properties are equiv-
alent:

(1) there exists a natural Gysin map θ ∈ HomD(Y )(Rπ∗QX, QY );
(2) there exists a natural morphism of graded groups

H •(X; Q) −→ H •(Y ; Q);

(3) we have an isomorphism in D(Y ):

h≥0

ιh : QY + X

ON THE GYSIN MORPHISM FOR THE BLOW-UP OF AN ORDINARY SINGULARITY 7

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) by Deﬁnitions 2.3 and 2.4. (2) ⇒ (3) just combining Propositions
3.2 and 3.4.

(3) ⇒ (1): If Lh≥0 ιh is an isomorphism in D(Y ), the projection on the ﬁrst

summand of QY + Ph≥1 Rhπ∗QX [−h] represents a bivariant class

θ ∈ HomD(Y )(Rπ∗QX , QY )

such that

θ ◦ ι0 = id ∈ HomD(Y )(QY , QY ),

and the ﬁrst condition of Deﬁnition 2.3 is satisﬁed.

As for (2) of Deﬁnition 2.3, since the sheaves Rhπ∗QX are supported on ∞, we

have

QY |U = ((θ ◦ ι0)QY ) |U = θ(QX ) |U = QX |U

in D(U ), and we are done.

(cid:3)

4. Examples

4.1. Examples of desingularizations admitting a natural Gysin morphism.
In this section we let X be a split, projective bundle over some smooth variety
M ⊂ Pn:

p : X = P(OM ⊕ OM (k)) −→ M,

k ≥ 1.

Obviously, the vector bundle OM ⊕ OM (k) surjects on both on OM (k) and OM .
Accordingly we have two imbeddings

iG : M ↔ G ⊂ X,

iΘ : M ↔ Θ ⊂ X,

where G and Θ are smooth Cartier divisors of X such that Θ = G + kH and
G ∩ Θ = ∅ ([5, §3.1], [6, §4.1]). The linear system | Θ | on X turns out to be
basepoint-free, hence it provides a morphism

π : X −→ Y.

Since G ∩ Θ = ∅, such a morphism contracts G to a point ∞ ∈ Y . Furthermore, by
[5, §3.1] and [9, Proposition 2.12], the linear system | Θ | is very ample outside G.

Theorem 4.1. The morphism π : X −→ Y just deﬁned admits a natural Gysin
map, according to Deﬁnition 2.4.

Proof. By Theorem 3.5, we need to prove that there exists

θ : H •(X; Q) −→ H •(Y ; Q)

satisfying (1) and (2) of Deﬁnition 2.3.

In order to deﬁne θ, let’s denote by c ∈ H 2(X; Q) the Chern class of the line

bundle OX (Θ). By the Leray-Hirsch Theorem, we have an isomorphism:

(6)

(p∗(·), p∗(·) ∪ c) : H i(M ; Q) ⊕ H i−2(M ; Q) −→ H i(X; Q).

8

VINCENZO DI GENNARO AND DAVIDE FRANCO

The composite p ◦ iG : M ↔ M is the identity map. So, by functoriality, the
pullback

(7)

H i(M ; Q) ⊕ H i−2(M ; Q) ≃ H i(X; Q)

i∗
G−→ H i(G; Q) ≃ H i(M ; Q)

is surjective. Furthermore, we have

(8)

G(c) = 0 ∈ H 2(G; Q)
i∗

because G ∩ Θ = ∅. Combining (6), (7) and (8) we ﬁnd

Ker i∗

G = H i−2(M ; Q).

From Lemma 2.5 and the exact sequence

H i(X, G; Q) −→ H i(X; Q) −→ H i(G; Q),

we conclude that

(9) H i(Y ; Q) ≃ H i(X, G; Q) ≃ H i−2(M ; Q) ≃ Im(p∗(·) ∪ c) ֒→ H i(X; Q).

On the other hand, we have the following exact sequence:

(10)

H i(X, X − Θ; Q) ≃ H i−2(Θ; Q) · ∪ u−→ H i(X; Q) −→ H i(X − Θ; Q) ≃ H i(M ; Q),

where u ∈ H 2(X, X − Θ; Q) denotes the orientation class and where the last map is
surjective, as we have just proved. We have Im(· ∪ u) ⊆ Ker i∗
G because G∩Θ = ∅.
Then equations (6)-(10) imply that

H i(X, X − Θ; Q) ≃ Im(· ∪ u) = Ker i∗

G ≃ H i(Y ; Q).

We deﬁne

θ : H •(X; Q) ≃ H •(M ; Q) ⊕ H •−2(M ; Q) ≃ H •(G; Q) ⊕ H •(Y ; Q) −→ H •(Y ; Q)

as the projection over the second summand. As H •(Y ; Q) ≃ Im(· ∪ u), we can
conclude because condition (1) of Deﬁnition 2.3 is trivially veriﬁed, and condition
(2) of Deﬁnition 2.3 follows by functoriality.
(cid:3)

4.2. Examples of desingularizations not admitting a natural Gysin mor-
phism. Consider two smooth hypersurfaces G ⊂ PN , F ⊂ PN with

(compare with [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]). Assume that the complete intersection

k := deg G < d := deg F

is smooth and consider the rational map

W := G ∩ F

Y 99K P := P(H 0(PN , IW (d))∗)

deﬁned by the linear system |H 0(PN , IW (d))|. In [5, p. 755], [6, §4.1], [8, §2], and
[9, Notation 2.11, Proposition 2.12], one can ﬁnd a detailed description of such a

ON THE GYSIN MORPHISM FOR THE BLOW-UP OF AN ORDINARY SINGULARITY 9

rational map. By [11, 4.4], we have a morphism X := BlW (PN ) → P. We denote
by Y the image of this morphism:

(11)

Y := Im(X := BlW (PN ) → P).

The projective variety Y is a monoid, i.e. a rational variety with a unique ordinary
multiple point, and the morphism

π : X −→ Y

turns out to be the Blowing-up of the unique singularity ∞ ∈ Y ([5, p. 755], [6,
§4.1], [6, Notation 2.11, Proposition 2.12]):

G
π|Gl
∞

→ X
↓ π
→ Y.

We are going to show that π does NOT admit a natural Gysin morphism, when
k ≥ 3. By Theorem 3.5 and Lemma 2.5, in order that π : X −→ Y admits a natural
Gysin morphism, it is necessary that the map

H i(X; Q) −→ H i(G; Q)

is surjective for each i. Diﬀerently said, what we need is that

is injective for each i. By [8, (4)], we have

Hi(G; Q) −→ Hi(X; Q)

Hi(X; Q) ≃ Hi(PN ; Q) ⊕ Hi−2(W ; Q).

In particular,

so

and we are done.

HN −1(X; Q) ≃ HN −1(PN ; Q) ⊕ HN −3(W ; Q),

dimHN −1(X; Q) ≤ 2 < dimHN −1(G; Q),

Remark 4.2. Comparing the examples given in this section with that of previous
one, we see that for any smooth projective hypersurface G one can construct ex-
amples of desingularizations having G as projective tangent cone and admitting
a natural Gysin morphism, as well as examples of desingularizations having the
same projective tangent cone and not admitting a natural Gysin morphism. So the
existence of a natural Gysin morphism is far from being a local property of the
singularity.
