Competing Kondo Eﬀects in Non-Kramers Doublet Systems

Hiroaki Kusunose∗

Department of Physics, Meiji University, Kanagawa 214-8571, Japan

In non-Kramers Kondo systems with a quadrupolar degrees of freedom, an ordinary magnetic Kondo eﬀect can com-
pete with the quadrupolar Kondo eﬀect. We discuss such competition keeping PrT2Zn20 (T =Ir, Rh) and PrT2Al20 (T =V,
Ti) in mind, where the Γ3 non-Kramers crystalline-electric-ﬁeld (CEF) doublet ground state is realized in Pr3+ ion with
(4 f )2 conﬁguration under cubic symmetry. The quadrupolar Kondo eﬀect can be described by the two-channel Kondo
model, which leads to the local non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) ground state, while the magnetic Kondo eﬀect favors the or-
dinary local Fermi-liquid (FL) ground state. Based on the minimal extended two-channel Kondo model including the
magnetic Kondo coupling as well, we investigate the competition and resulting thermodynamics, and orbital/magnetic,
and single-particle excitation spectra by the Wilson’s numerical renormalization-group (NRG) method. There exists the
ﬁrst-order transition between the NFL and FL ground states. In addition to these two states, the alternative FL state
accompanied by a free magnetic spin appears in intermediate temperature range, which eventually reaches the true NFL
ground state, as a consequence of stronger competition between the magnetic and quadrupolar Kondo eﬀects. In this
peculiar state, the magnetic susceptibility shows a Curie-like behavior, while the orbital ﬂuctuation exhibits the FL be-
havior. Moreover, the single-particle spectra yield a more singular behavior. Implications to the Pr 1-2-20 systems are
brieﬂy discussed.

Introduction

Fundamental aspect of Ce-based heavy-fermion systems
has been understood by investigating magnetic Kondo eﬀect,
by which the large entropy of the localized f electrons at
high temperatures is released to form Landau quasiparticles
with the heavy eﬀective mass. The Kondo eﬀect also gives
rise to the indirect magnetic interaction via conduction elec-
trons, which suppresses the Kondo screening and leads to
magnetically ordered state. The competition between screen-
ing and stabilizing the f -electron magnetic moments leads to
the quantum critical point (QCP), and a variety of supercon-
ductivities has emerged in the vicinity of the QCP.

In contrast to the above “conventional” view of heavy
fermions that is well known as the Doniach picture in the
Ce-based systems, Pr-based and U-based compounds require
a diﬀerent picture as they are characterized by plural
f -
electron conﬁguration, which allows us to explore pure or-
bital physics with non-Kramers degeneracy. In such context,
recently found PrT2Zn20 (T =Ir, Rh) and PrT2Al20 (T =V, Ti)
provide interesting playgrounds since they are characterized
by the non-Kramers Γ3 doublet CEF ground state, in which
electric quadrupoles and a magnetic octupole become active
but no magnetic dipoles play a role in low-energy physics.1–11
Indeed, they show considerable deviation in temperature de-
pendences of the speciﬁc heat, resistivity and so on from the
conventional FL behaviors.3, 4, 12, 13 They also exhibit the elec-
tric quadrupole order which even coexists with superconduc-
tivity.1–5, 7, 9, 10, 14–19

The Al-systems show a logarithmic increase in the resistiv-
ity at high temperatures,3 which is an indication of the mag-
netic Kondo eﬀect, while the Zn-systems exhibit no magnetic
Kondo eﬀects.1, 2 Moreover, the conventional T 2 behavior is
observed in the resistivity of PrTi2Al20 at ambient pressure,3
which drastically changes to anomalous behaviors by apply-
ing pressure.3, 17, 18

Motivated by these observations, an interplay between the
conventional magnetic Kondo eﬀect and electric quadrupo-
lar Kondo eﬀect in the non-Kramers doublet systems is ad-
dressed.20 As a consequence of the competition between two
Kondo eﬀects, the peculiar electronic state emerges in which
the magnetic susceptibility shows a Curie-like behavior, while
the quadrupolar response is the FL-like. The resistivity has a
more anomalous T dependence than the NFL21–37 of the two-
channel Kondo model, T 1/2. This peculiar state is very sen-
sitive to a detailed balance of the two Kondo eﬀects, which
implies a relevance to the enigmatic behaviors of PrTi2Al20
under pressures.3, 17, 18

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we
introduce the minimal extended two-channel Kondo model
in terms of the simpliﬁed j- j coupling scheme. We identify
two limiting cases which correspond to the FL and NFL ﬁxed
points. In §3, using the NRG calculation,38, 39 we present the
overall phase diagram, thermodynamic properties and dynam-
ical spectral functions. Based on these results, we discuss the
properties of the peculiar electronic state that is emerged by
the strong competition between two Kondo eﬀects. The ﬁnal
section summarizes the paper.

2. Extended Two-Channel Kondo Model
2.1 Minimal model

The magnetic ion, Pr3+,

in PrT2Zn20 (T =Ir, Rh) and
PrT2Al20 (T =V, Ti) has (4 f )2 conﬁguration with the total an-
gular momentum, J = 4. Under the cubic Td (T in the case
of PrRh2Zn20) point-group symmetry, J = 4 multiplet splits
into Γ1 singlet, Γ3 doublet, and two Γ4, Γ5 triplets. The non-
Kramers degeneracy appears due to even number of local-
ized f electrons, to which the Kramers theorem cannot apply.
The CEF states in these compounds are commonly charac-
terized by the Γ3 non-Kramers doublet ground state and the
ﬁrst-excited Γ4 or Γ5 magnetic triplet state.1–10

The non-Kramers Γ3 doublet has the pure electric

quadrupoles, and a magnetic octupole. Since the localized de-
grees of freedom is non-magnetic, there exist two equivalent
scattering channels corresponding to the time-reversal pair of
conduction electrons with quadrupoles. This is a heart of the
so-called quadrupolar Kondo eﬀect that is described by the
two-channel Kondo model. Its ground state is known as the
local NFL due to overscreening of the f -electron quadrupole
by two quadrupoles of the conduction electrons with the ↑
and ↓ spins.21 On the other hand, the excited triplet state has
magnetic dipole moments, which are screened by an ordinary
magnetic Kondo eﬀect, leading to the local FL ground state.
In order to describe these two Kondo screening processes,
we construct a minimal Kondo impurity system with the elec-
tric quadrupoles and magnetic dipoles by adopting the j-
j coupling scheme,40 where f 2 states can be expressed by
putting two electrons into one-body f -electron states, Γ7 dou-
blet ( f †7σ with σ =↑, ↓), and Γ8 quartet ( f †mσ with m = 1, 2). In
what follows, we have neglected the doubly occupied states,
|m ↑i |m ↓i (m = 1, 2, 7), by assuming the large intra-atomic
Coulomb repulsion for simplicity.
Introducing the spin operators,

S f m = Xαβ

f †mα(cid:18) σαβ

2 (cid:19) fmβ,

(2.1)

the Γ4(Γ5) state can be expressed by the triplet state of the
total spin, S f 1(2) + S f 7, while the singlet states of it consti-
tute the non-Kramers Γ3 doublet. The orbital operator can be
expressed by

T f = Xσ

(2.2)

Here, σ and τ are the Pauli matrices acting onto the Kramers
and non-Kramers pairs, respectively. Note that T f can ﬂip
the “orbital” index m = 1, 2, which exchanges the states
among the non-Kramers doublet or the Γ4 and Γ5 states with-
out changing their spin states.

Here, Pm = (3/4)n f mn f 7+S f m·S f 7 with the f -electron number
in the m orbital, n f m = Pσ f †mσ fmσ, is the projection operator
onto the two triplet states. We have also introduced the other
excited state ∆1, in which two f electrons occupy the m =
1 and m = 2 orbitals with leaving the Γ7 state empty. We
have neglected the energy splittings between the Γ4 and Γ5
states, and among the pair-electron states in the Γ8 orbitals
for simplicity. The CEF levels in the j- j coupling scheme and
their expressions are shown in Fig. 1 and Table I.

2.2 Quadrupolar Kondo limit

Let us consider the case where the excited CEF states can
be neglected, or K ≫ J. In this case, S f m becomes inactive,

2

and within the Γ3 doublet, |ui and |i, the orbital operator is
reduced to

T f → τ f ≡

(2.10)

Then, the extended two-channel Kondo model is reduced to
the ordinary two-channel Kondo model as
tσ · τ f ,

H = Hc + KXσ

(2.11)

and we expect the NFL ground state in this limit.21–30

2.3 Magnetic Kondo limit

The other limit is J ≫ K, ∆1. In this case, both f elec-
trons tend to occupy Γ8 states in order to gain the magnetic
exchange energy, J, which correspond to the excited states
with the energy ∆1. Since S f 7 and T f become inactive in this
case, the model is reduced to

H = Hc + J

sm · S f m.

(2.12)

This is nothing but two independent single-channel Kondo
models, yielding the ordinary FL behaviors.

3. Results

We perform the NRG calculation on the extended two-
channel Kondo model. In the NRG computation,39 the con-
duction band is discretized logarithmically to focus on the
low-energy excitations. For this purpose, the kinetic-energy
term is transformed to the hopping-type Hamiltonian on the
semi-inﬁnite one-dimensional chain, which can be solved
by iterative diagonalization with appropriate truncation of
higher-energy states. In this paper, we have used the dis-
cretization parameter Λ = 3, and retained at least 700 low-
energy states for each iteration step, N. Note that the itera-
tion step N corresponds to the energy (temperature) scale of
Λ−(N−1)/2, and hence the larger N corresponds to lower T . The
CEF splittings are chosen as ∆ = 1×10−3 and ∆1 = 5×10−3 in
unit of the half bandwidth of the conduction electrons, D = 1,
throughout this paper.

Since we neglect the hybridization for the Γ7 orbital, the
sectors with n f 7 = 0 and n f 7 = 1 are decoupled, and n f 7 does
not change for whole iteration steps. Note that the quadrupo-
lar (magnetic) Kondo limit belongs to n f 7 = 1 (n f 7 = 0) sec-
tor. We can keep track of the low-energy states by two con-
versed quantities in addition to n f 7, namely, C ≡ (Q, S z, n f 7),
where Q is the total electron number measured from the half-
ﬁlling and S z is the z-component of the total spin. The total
number of f electrons is kept ﬁxed as n f = 2.

3.1 Phase diagram

Figure 2 shows the phase diagram of the extended two-
channel Kondo model. There are three distinct states at the
lowest T , two of which are nothing but the states we expected
in the limiting cases. Namely, the larger J region is the FL
ground state that is characterized by C = (0, 0, 0), while the
larger K region is the NFL ground state with doubly degener-
ate, C = (0, 0, 1)2. For K = 0 and the smaller J, we have the
isolated CEF doublet ground state decoupled with the con-
duction electrons. The boundary between the NFL and FL at

(Color online) Phase diagram for the extended two-channel Kondo
model. FL(NFL) indicates the local Fermi (non-Fermi) liquid ground state.
“FL+FS” represents an alternative Fermi-liquid state with eﬀective free mag-
netic spin S = 1/2 at the lowest temperature we computed. The true ground
state eventually becomes NFL. The black circles at K = 0 indicate the CEF
doublet ground state decoupled with the conduction electrons.

K = 0 is roughly determined by the condition that the mag-
netic Kondo temperature, TKm, is equal to ∆1/2 (See also in
Fig. 9). When the former exceeds the latter, the FL state is
stabilized by exciting two f electrons into the Γ8 states to
form two independent Kondo singlets. Since the FL and NFL
ground states have diﬀerent n f 7, the transition between them
becomes ﬁrst order.

The typical ﬂow diagram of the low-lying energies for
K = 0.10, J = 0.40 at the iteration step, N, is shown in
Fig. 3, where the energies are enlarged by a factor Λ(N−1)/2.
This spectrum can be interpreted as the individual particle-
hole excitations of the “quasi particles” on a ﬁnite chain, and
hence it represents the FL ﬁxed point.38

On the contrary, the ﬂow diagram for K = 0.10, J = 0.05 is
shown in Fig. 4, which represents the typical excitation spec-
tra of the overscreening NFL ﬁxed point.21 Namely, there is
no even-odd alternation, and the spectra cannot be interpreted
as simple particle-hole excitations of “quasi particles”. In-
deed, this excitation spectra including degeneracy coincide
with those of the two-channel Kondo model. Since the f -
electron conﬁguration diﬀers in the FL and NFL phases, the
strong orbital ﬂuctuation between Γ7 and Γ8 may be expected
near the FL-NFL boundary. This is the important consequence
of the cubic symmetry and the non-Kramers CEF ground
state.

The interesting behavior appears for larger K and J. In the
ﬂow diagram for K = 0.30, J = 0.20 shown in Fig. 5, the
excitation spectra at the lowest energy scale, i.e., N = 38
and 39, are equivalent to those of Fig. 4, indicating that the
ground state is characterized by the NFL ﬁxed point. How-
ever, at the intermediate energy scales, N . N∗ (N∗ = 25

larger (the crossover energy scale becomes smaller) as K and

quadrupolar and magnetic Kondo eﬀects. As will be shown
later, the competing region (indicated by “FL+FS” in Fig. 2)
is characterized by an eﬀective S = 1/2 free spin which cou-
ples marginally with conduction electrons, as similar to the

3.2 Thermodynamic properties

Next, we discuss the thermodynamic properties of the
model. Thermodynamic quantities are evaluated at the tem-
perature, T = t Λ−(N−1)/2 with t = 0.4 for each step N. Fig-
ure 7 shows the T dependence of the impurity entropy for
K = 0.10 with increasing J = 0.05, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.40. In
the NFL phase, we have the residual entropy (1/2) ln 2 which
is the characteristic feature of the overscreening ﬁxed point
of the two-channel Kondo model. On the other hand, the en-
tropy vanishes in the FL phase. We deﬁne the Kondo tem-
peratures for the quadrupolar and magnetic Kondo eﬀects by
S (TKq) = (3/4) ln 2 and S (TKm) = (1/2) ln 2, respectively.

In Fig. 8, S (T ) is shown for K = 0.30. In this case, TKm has
a weak J dependence in the FL phase, while TKq is strongly

In the NFL phase, we have the residual entropy (1/2) ln 2, while in the
FL phase, the entropy vanishes. We deﬁne the Kondo temperatures for
the quadrupolar and magnetic Kondo eﬀects by S (TKq) = (3/4) ln 2 and
S (TKm) = (1/2) ln 2, respectively.

trons at the Fermi energy. On the contrary, TKq is strongly suppressed for
K = 0.30 toward the FL+FS region.

it shows a typical FL behavior below TKm for K = 0.10 and
J = 0.40. On the other hand, χm(T ) shows the Curie-like be-
havior toward the FL-FS region for K = 0.30 with increase of
J. This indicates the presence of the eﬀective free magnetic
spin, S = 1/2.

In the similar procedure, the T dependence of the impu-
rity quadrupolar susceptibility, χq(T ) is obtained by the ex-
pectation value of T f z in the presence of the −hqT f z term with
hq = 10−6. Figure 11 shows the T dependence of χq(T ). For
K = 0.10 and J = 0.05, χq(T ) shows a logarithmic divergence
below TKq, as a typical behavior of the two-channel Kondo
model. On the contrary, χq(T ) vanishes at T below TKm for
K = 0.10 and J = 0.40 where the magnetic Kondo eﬀect
dominates the low-energy phenomena. For K = 0.30, χq(T )
changes from the NFL behavior to FL behavior with the satu-
rating T dependence, as J increases toward the FL+FS region.

3.3 Excitation spectra

Next, let us investigate the dynamical properties of the
magnetic and quadrupolar excitations. In the NRG, the spec-
tral densities at T = 0 are computed for the frequency ω =
α Λ−(N−1)/2 with α = 2.0 by means of the spectral representa-
tion of the two-particle Green’s functions for S f z and T f z. In
the expression of the spectral representation, we approximate
the delta function as the logarithmic gaussian,

In the NFL phase, the excitation spectra are shown in
Fig. 12 for K = 0.10, J = 0.05. Im χm(ω) shows the typ-
ical peaked structure at ω ∼ TKm & ∆ corresponding to
the magnetic Kondo eﬀect. On the other hand, Im χq(ω) ex-
hibits the NFL excitation spectrum (Im χq(ω) ∝ ln ω), which
is consistent with the logarithmically divergent quadrupolar
susceptibility, χq(T ) as shown in Fig. 11. In the FL phase for
K = 0.10, J = 0.40, Im χq(ω) is completely suppressed, and

suppressed as J increases in the NFL phase, yielding that the
ln 2 entropy remains at the lowest T in the FL+FS region.

We summarize the J dependences of TKm and TKq, for
K = 0.10 and K = 0.30 in Fig. 9. For larger J, TKm fol-
lows the conventional formula of the Kondo temperature,
√ρcJ exp(−1/ρcJ), where ρc is the density of states of the
conduction electrons at the Fermi energy. TKq also increases
monotonously as J increases for K = 0.10. On the contrary,
TKq is strongly suppressed due to the competition, and the
residual ln 2 entropy remains in the FL+FS region, 0.2 . J .

The magnetic property can be elucidated by the T de-
pendence of the impurity magnetic susceptibility, χm(T ). We
compute it as the expectation value of S f z under the Zeeman
term, −hsS f z with a small ﬁeld hs = 10−6. In Fig. 10, χm(T )
almost vanishes at T below ∆ for K = 0.10, J = 0.05, while

Figures 16 and 17 show the prime examples of the spectra
in the NFL and FL phases, and the transition from the NFL to
the FL+FS state, respectively. In any cases, the Kondo reso-
nance peak develops at low energies resulting from the mag-
netic and/or quadrupolar Kondo eﬀects. In Fig. 16, T ′′(ω) ∝
const. − |ω|1/2 for J = 0.05 in the NFL phase, while T ′′(ω) ∝
const. − ω2 for J = 0.40 in the FL phase. It is interest-
ing to note that the Kondo resonance peak appears even in
the FL+FS region, where the magnetic spin looks as if it is
free with the ln 2 entropy. In the case of the NFL and FL
phases as shown in Fig. 16, the symmetric spectra are ob-
tained due to the particle-hole symmetry. For K = 0.30 and
small J, the spectrum is similar to that of the NFL. How-
ever, it changes drastically to much more singular behavior,
T ′′(ω) ∝ const. − ln |ω| as J increases toward the FL+FS re-
gion. The logarithmic divergence in T ′′(ω) is cut oﬀ even-
tually at the order of TKq which is remarkably small in the
FL+FS region. It can be deduced the temperature dependence
of the resistivity ρ(T ) from the T ′′(ω), i.e., it may be obtained

3.4 Relevance to PrT2X20

Now, let us discuss a relevance to the prominent observa-
tions in PrT2X20 systems based on the results obtained in the
previous sections, although our analysis only takes account
of the single-impurity Kondo eﬀects, and a lattice eﬀect may
alter coherent properties, and lead to long-range orders.

Figure 18 shows the ∆ dependence of the quadrupole or-
dering temperature TQ, and the superconducting Tc for exten-
sively studied four Pr 1-2-20 systems.1–10 The monotonous in-
creasing behaviors of TQ and Tc with increase of ∆ indicates
that the overall energy scale increases in order of PrIr2Zn20
(PrRh2Zn20), PrV2Al20 and PrITi2Al20. Naively, it is also ex-
pected that the hybridization strengths or the Kondo couplings
increase in the same order of the overall energy scale. Note

ingly, at ambient pressure the entropy of PrV2Al20 is gradu-
ally decreasing from R ln 2 on cooling below 5 K, while the
entropy of PrTi2Al20 stays at about R ln 2 above 2 K and then
it decreases abruptly below 2 K.9 Although this behavior in-
dicates the presence of robust degeneracy of the localized de-
grees of freedom, the development of the Kondo resonance
peak at the Fermi energy has been observed by the Pr 3d-
4 f resonant photoemission spectroscopy.44 All of the facts (i)
the robust ln 2 entropy, (ii) the drastic crossover between the
NFL and FL behaviors being quite sensitive to the pressure,
and (iii) the presence of the magnetic Kondo eﬀect suggest a
relevance to the peculiar state in the FL+FS region. This is
because the Ti-system has a larger energy scale and then the
possible competition of two Kondo eﬀects may arise. A de-
tailed investigation along this scenario is left for future study
based on a lattice version of the extended two-channel Kondo
model. For experimental side, investigations on the magnetic
and dynamical properties are highly desired under high pres-
sures.

4. Summary

We have discussed possible competition between the
quadrupolar (K) and magnetic (J) Kondo eﬀects on the basis
of the extended two-channel Kondo model. There are three
distinct states in the model, (i) the (local) Fermi-liquid state
(J ≫ K), (ii) the (local) non-Fermi-liquid state (J ≪ K),
and (iii) the marginally free-spin state (J ≈ K) with pe-
culiar thermodynamic and dynamical properties. The can-
didate compounds for this competition are the recently in-
vestigated PrT2X20. The low-temperature NFL behaviors in
PrIr2Zn20 and PrRh2Zn20 seem to be the occurrence of the
pure quadrupolar Kondo eﬀect as the state (ii) with small
J and K. The similar NFL behaviors observed in PrV2Al20
may be interpreted in a similar way as the Zn-systems in
which the energy scale of PrV2Al20 is roughly twice larger
than PrIr2Zn20. The system seems to be located in the re-
gion of K < 0.15 in Fig. 2 where the state (iii) does not
appear as J increases. On the contrary, PrTi2Al20 seems to
be the case that the crossover between the NFL and FL+FS
may occur by applying the pressure since the energy scale of
PrTi2Al20 is considerably larger than the other systems. To re-
veal intrinsic characteristics of PrTi2Al20,41 further investiga-
tions especially on the magnetic and dynamical properties are
highly desired under high pressures. Extensive investigations
for corresponding dilute Pr systems2, 16 could bring about fur-
ther insights on the peculiar Kondo eﬀects in the non-Kramers
Kondo systems.

(Color online) Quadrupole ordering temperature, TQ and the su-
perconducting Tc versus the 1st CEF excitation energy, ∆ for PrT2X20. The
monotonic ∆ dependence of TQ and Tc indicates that the overall energy scale
increases in the order of PrIr2Zn20 (PrRh2Zn20), PrV2Al20, and PrTi2Al20. It
is expected that the hybridization strengths also increase in the same order of
∆.

that however since the quadrupolar and magnetic Kondo cou-
pling comes from the same hybridization channels of the Γ8
orbitals, the ratio J/K would be the order of unity.

In PrIr2Zn20 and PrRh2Zn20,

the resistivity decreases
monotonously from the room temperature, and there is no
logarithmic increase at higher temperatures above ∆, mean-
ing that no magnetic Kondo eﬀect takes place in these com-
pounds. Below 1 K and above TQ, they exhibit the uncon-
ventional behaviors in the resistivity, speciﬁc heat, and See-
beck coeﬃcient.1, 2, 7, 12–14, 16, 41 The most remarkable feature
of these compounds is that the T dependence of the resistivity
and speciﬁc heat under small magnetic ﬁelds satisfy a scal-
ing relation.12, 13, 42 Namely, they can be described by a sin-
gle curve as a function of T /TQKL for several values of the
magnetic ﬁelds where TQKL is the characteristic temperature.
The universal curves coincide well with the theoretical predic-
tions of the quadrupolar Kondo (lattice) model.21, 37 This fact
strongly suggests that the lattice quadrupolar Kondo eﬀect is
indeed realized in PrIr2Zn20 and PrRh2Zn20. The situation for
these compounds seems to correspond to the small J and K re-
gion in our phase diagram, Fig. 2, and the quadrupolar Kondo
eﬀect predominates over the magnetic Kondo eﬀect.

On the contrary, PrV2Al20 and PrTi2Al20 exhibit the loga-
rithmic increases in the resistivity above 60 K, indicating the
occurrence of the magnetic Kondo eﬀect. The former shows
the NFL behaviors similar to those of PrIr2Zn20 below 3 K,
while the latter exhibits the ordinary T 2 dependence below 20
K.3, 5, 9, 10, 15, 17, 18 Thus, it is important to test whether the uni-
versal scaling relation is also valid for PrV2Al20 or not in or-
der to elucidate a universal feature of the quadrupolar Kondo
eﬀect.43 For PrTi2Al20 on the other hand, applying pressure up
to 8.7 GPa, the resistivity in PrTi2Al20 shows a drastic change
from the FL behavior to NFL behavior above about 3 GPa,
and this NFL behavior is quite diﬀerent from that in PrIr2Zn20
and PrRh2Zn20. The change of the resistivity behaviors is very
sensitive to the pressure.17, 18, 43 Tc shows a peak-like structure
at the lowest TQ with a sizable mass enhancement. Interest-
