ON A RELATIVE FORM OF VERDIER SPECIALIZATION

JAMES FULLWOOD AND DONGXU WANG

Dedicated to Henry Laufer on his 70th birthday

Abstract. We prove a relative form of Verdier’s specialization formula, and apply it to
derive a Chern class identity predicted by string dualities.

1. Introduction

Let Y → ∆ be a family over a disk about the origin in C such that the total space of the
family is a topological locally trivial ﬁbration over ∆ \ 0. Denote a ﬁber over t 6= 0 by Yt
and the central ﬁber by Y0. In [14], Verdier deﬁnes specialization morphisms

σH : H∗(Yt) → H∗(Y0),

σF : F (Y ) → F (Y0),

where H∗ denotes the integral homology functor and F denotes the functor that takes a
variety to its group of constructible functions. These morphisms are functorial in the sense
that they commute with taking Chern classes, as Verdier proves that for any constructible
function ϑ ∈ F (Y ) and t suﬃciently small

σH cSM( ϑ|Yt) = cSM(σF (ϑ)),

(1.1)

where cSM(·) denotes the morphism which takes a constructible function to its Chern-
Schwartz-MacPherson class. Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes evaluated at the constant
function 1 yield a generalization of the total homological Chern class to possibly singular
varieties which extend the Gauß-Bonnet-Chern theorem to the singular setting, since for X
possibly singular we have

cSM(1X) = χ(X),

where 1X denotes the indicator function of X (i.e., the constant function 1) and χ(X) its
topological Euler characteristic with compact support. For the indicator function 1Y of the
total space of the family Y → ∆, Verdier’s specialization σF 1Y ∈ F (Y0) to the central ﬁber
is such that

cSM(σF 1Y ) = χ(Yt),

and thus yields a deformation invariant generalization of Euler characteristic to the realm
of singular varieties. In the case that the central ﬁber Y0 is regularly embedded the class
cSM(σF 1Y ) ∈ H∗Y0 coincides with a characteristic class for singular varieties and schemes
referred to as the Chern-Fulton class ([10], § 4.2.3), in which case we have

cSM(σF 1Y ) = c(TvirY0) ∩ [Y0] ∈ H∗Y0,

where TvirY0 denotes the virtual tangent bundle of Y0, i.e., T M|Y0 − NY0M. In this note,
we ﬁx a smooth complex base variety B and consider the case where all ﬁbers of the family
Y → ∆ come equipped with a morphism ϕt : Yt → B, and prove a relative version of

1

formula (1.1) for the case ϑ = 1Y . In particular, we ﬁx a proper morphism f : X → B of
smooth complex varieties, a vector bundle E → X, and let

s : X × ∆ → E

be a regular morphism such that st = s(·, t) is a generic section of E → X for all t ∈ ∆ \ 0,
with s0 possibly non-generic. Considering the zero-schemes of the sections st as t varies in
∆ gives rise to a family Y → ∆, such that each ﬁber is a closed subscheme of X regularly
t E . By composing the
embedded by the natural inclusion Yt
natural inclusion associated with each ﬁber with the morphism f yields proper morphisms

ιt
֒→ X, whose normal bundle is ι∗

for all t ∈ ∆. Our result is then given by the following

ϕt = f ◦ ιt : Yt → B

Theorem 1.1. With notations as given above

cSM(cid:0) ϕt ∗1Y |Yt(cid:1) = cSM (ϕ0∗σF 1Y ) ∈ H∗B,

(1.2)

where ϕt∗ and ϕ0∗ denote the proper pushforward of constructible functions associated with
the morphisms ϕt and ϕ0 respectively.

Explicitly computing both sides of equation (1.2) for a given family Y → ∆ subject
to the assumptions above then yields a non-trival Chern class identity between seemingly
unrelated varieties, as the constructible functions ϕt ∗1Y |Yt and ϕ0∗σF 1Y will in general be
quite diﬀerent. We were motivated to derive such a formula in our eﬀorts to yield a purely
mathematical explanation for the existence of certain Chern class identities predicted by
string dualities in physics. In particular, a regime of string theory referred to as ‘F-theory’
models the purported compactiﬁed dimensions of spacetime by an elliptic fourfold Y → B
(with B a Fano threefold), and the preservation of a quantity referred to as ‘D3 charge’
under S-duality with a weakly coupled type-IIB orientifold theory predicts a relation of the
form

χ(Y ) =Xi

χ(Di),

where Di are hypersurfaces in B which support D7-branes in the type-IIB theory. Such
relations –referred to as tadpole relations– provide a consistency check between the two
theories, as well as yield non-trivial mathematical identities among Euler characteristics of
the varieties Y and the Di. Moreover, it has been shown that these tadpole relations coming
from physics are degree-zero terms of Chern class identities which hold in a much broader
context than their physical origins [2][3][7][8]. In particular, the Chern class identities which
yield the tadpole relations in physics hold for elliptic ﬁbrations ϕ : Y → B with B of arbitrary
dimension and Y not necessarily Calabi-Yau. In [9], it was shown by deriving a special case
of Theorem 1.1 that the Chern class identities predicted by physics are manifestations of a
relative form of Verdier specialization, thus providing a purely mathematical explanation for
the existence of such identities.

In what follows, we review the theory of Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes of con-
structible functions, prove Theorem 1.1, and then use Theorem 1.1 to derive a non-trivial
Chern class identity predicted by string dualities. For those acquainted with the physical
signiﬁcance of such identities, we close with a proposed general deﬁnition of ‘orientifold Euler
characteristic’, which captures the contribution of a singular brane to the D3 charge.

2. Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes and a proof of Theorem 1.1

Let X be a complex variety. A constructible function on X is an integer-valued function

of the form

with each ai ∈ Z, Wi ⊂ X a closed subvariety and 1Wi the function that evaluates to 1
for points inside of Wi and is zero elsewhere. The collection of all such functions forms an
abelian group under addition, and is referred to as the group of constructible functions on X,
denoted F (X). A proper morphism f : X → Y induces a functorial group homomorphism
f∗ : F (X) → F (Y ), which by linearity is determined by the prescription

ai1Wi,

Xi

f∗1W (p) = χ(cid:0)f −1(p) ∩ W(cid:1) ,

(2.1)

where W ⊂ X is a closed subvariety and χ denotes topological Euler characteristic with
compact support. By taking F (f ) = f∗, we may view F as a covariant functor from varieties
to abelian groups. Now denote by H∗ homology functor, which takes a variety to its inte-
gral homology. Both the the constructible function functor and the homology functor are
covariant with respect to proper maps. In the 1960s Deligne and Grothendieck conjectured
the existence of a unique natural transformation

such that for X smooth

c∗ : F → H∗

c∗(1X) = c(T X) ∩ [X] ∈ H∗X,

ZX

i.e., the total homological Chern class of X. For X possibly singular the class c∗(1X ) would
then be a generalization of Chern class to the realm of singular varieties. Moreover, functo-
riality would then imply

c∗(1X) = χ(X),

(2.2)

so that such a class would provide a natural generalization of the Gauß-Bonnet-Chern the-
orem to the singular setting. In 1974, Deligne and Grothendieck’s conjecture was proved
by Robert MacPherson [11], and as such the class c∗(1X ) became known as MacPherson’s
Chern class. It was shown later by Brasselet and Schwartz that MacPherson’s Chern class
was in fact the Alexander dual in relative cohomology of singular Chern classes constructed
by Marie-H´el`ene Schwartz in the 1960s using radial vector ﬁelds [4][13], thus the class c∗(1X)
is referred to at present as the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class, and is denoted by cSM(X).
The class c∗(δ) of a general constructible function δ will be denoted from here on by cSM(δ).
The proof of Theorem 1.1 essentially follows from the functoriality of Chern-Schwartz-
MacPherson classes and elementary manipulations, but before doing so we recall our as-
sumptions. So let B be a smooth complex variety, f : X → B be a proper morphism with
X smooth, and let E → X be a vector bundle. Denote by ∆ a disk about the origin in C.
We assume

s : X × ∆ → E

is a regular morphism such that st = s(·, t) is a generic section of E → X for t ∈ ∆ \ 0, with
s0 a possibly non-generic section. The zero-schemes of st as t varies in ∆ then gives rise to a
family Y → ∆, such that the ﬁbers Yt come equipped with morphisms ϕt : Yt → B, where
ϕt = f ◦ ιt with ιt : Yt ֒→ X the natural inclusion. In order to apply Verdier’s specialization

3

morhisms we assume that the family is a topological locally trivial ﬁbration over ∆ \ 0. We
will hold oﬀ giving a precise deﬁnition of Verdier’s specialization until §3 as it is not needed
for the proof of Theorem 1.1 modulo the acceptance of formula (1.1).

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We recall that our goal is to show

cSM(cid:0) ϕt ∗1Y |Yt(cid:1) = cSM (ϕ0 ∗σF 1Y ) .

For this, we ﬁrst note that it follows from the proof of Theorem 5.3 in [12] that for t 6= 0 we
have

σH cSM(Yt) =

ι∗
0c(T X)
ι∗
0c(E )

∩ [Y0],

thus by formula (1.1) we have

cSM(σF 1Y ) = σHcSM( 1Y |Yt)

= σHcSM(1Yt)
= σHcSM(Yt)

=

ι∗
0c(T X)
ι∗
0c(E )

∩ [Y0].

We then have

cSM (ϕ0∗σF 1Y ) = ϕ0∗cSM(σF 1Y )
0c(T X)
ι∗
0c(E )

0c(T X)

∩ [Y0](cid:19)
∩ ι0 ∗[Y0](cid:19)
∩ ιt ∗[Yt](cid:19)
∩ [Yt](cid:19)

= ϕ0∗(cid:18) ι∗
= f∗ ◦ ι0 ∗(cid:18) ι∗
= f∗(cid:18) c(T X)
= f∗(cid:18) c(T X)
= f∗ ◦ ιt ∗(cid:18) ι∗

c(E )

c(E )

t c(T X)
ι∗
t c(E )
= ϕt∗cSM(1Yt)
= ϕt∗cSM( 1Y |Yt)

= cSM(cid:0)ϕt∗ 1Y |Yt(cid:1) ,

as desired, where in the ﬁrst and ﬁnal equalities we use functoriality of cSM, the second
equality follows from our ﬁrst chain of equalities, the third and seventh by functoriality of
proper pushforward, the fourth and sixth by the projection formula, and the ﬁfth since Yt
and Y0 are both sections of E → X.

3. Derivation of a Chern class identity predicted by F-theory/type-IIB

duality

The geometric apparatus of a regime of string theory referred to as F-theory is an elliptic
ﬁbration over a Fano threefold ϕ : Y → B, whose total space Y –which plays the rˆole of the
compactiﬁed dimensions of spacetime– is a Calabi-Yau fourfold. A certain form of S-duality
then identiﬁes F-theory with a weakly coupled orientifold type-IIB theory, which is realized
geometrically by a singular degeneration (satisfying certain conditions coming from physics),
not only of the total space Y , but of the ﬁbration ϕ : Y → B, to a ﬁbration ϕ0 : Y0 → B
where all the ﬁbers are singular degenerations of elliptic curves. The duality is then captured
by the corresponding family over a disk

Y → ∆,

such that Y = Yt0 for some t0 ∈ ∆ and each ﬁber Yt comes equipped with a morphism
ϕt : Yt → B for all t ∈ ∆. Such a family is often referred to as a ‘weak coupling limit’ of
F-theory. There are certain divisors Di in B associated with the central ﬁber of the family Y0
whose Euler characteristics represent in the type-IIB theory what physicists refer to as ‘D3
charge’. Since on the F-theory side the total D3 charge is given by the Euler characteristic
of Y , the preservation of D3 charge under S-duality then leads one who is conﬁdent in the
theory to predict the relation

χ(Di),

(3.1)

χ(Y ) ?=Xi

which should necessarily hold if indeed F-theory and type-IIB are equivalent descriptions
of nature. Such relations which equate D3 charge in dual theories are often referred to as
tadpole relations. While in the physics literature tadpole relations are veriﬁed by explicitly
computing both sides, there is no reason a priori from a purely mathematical standpoint
why such relations should hold.
In [9] however, it was observed that such identities are
basically degree-zero manifestations of a special case of Theorem 1.1, and thus could be
derived from solely mathematical principles without having to explicitly compute any Euler
characteristics of Y or the Di.

We now illustrate this phenomenon by considering an explicit weak coupling limit of F-
theory ﬁrst constructed in [8], and then deriving the Chern class identity which encodes the
associated tadpole relation in degree zero via Theorem 1.1. In particular, we consider the
elliptic ﬁbration referred to in [8] as the Q7 ﬁbration, as it is constructed from an elliptic
curve whose deﬁning polynomial admits a Newton polygon which is a reﬂexive quadrilateral
with seven lattice points on its boundary.

So let B be a smooth compact variety over C endowed with an ample line bundle L → B,

and let E → B be the vector bundle given by

E = OB ⊕ OB ⊕ L .

Denote by π : P(E ) → B the projective bundle of lines in E . We then consider the Q7
ﬁbration (which was ﬁrst constructed in [5]), which is a hypersurface in the P2-bundle P(E )
given by

Y :(cid:0)yx2 − e1y3 + e2y2z + e3xz2 + e4yz2 + e5z3 = 0(cid:1) ⊂ P(E ),

where ei is a general section of π∗L 2 for i 6= 3 and e3 is a general section of π∗L . With
these prescriptions Y is then the zero-scheme associated with a section of OP(E )(3) ⊗ π∗L 2.

5

Composing the natural inclusion i : Y ֒→ P(E ) with the bundle projection π : P(E ) → B
then endows Y with the structure of an elliptic ﬁbration ϕ = π ◦ i : Y → B. In the case
that B is Fano we may take L to be the anticanonical bundle O(−KB) → B and then a
straghtforward calculation using adjunction shows that in such a case Y is in fact Calabi-
Yau. If we further restrict the base to be a Fano threefold then we are in the context of the
physical setting but we require no such assumptions.

A weak coupling limit of F-theory associated with the Q7 ﬁbration was then constructed
in [8] by deforming the coeﬃcient sections ei in terms of a deformation parameter t ∈ ∆
which gives rise to a family Y → ∆, in such a way that Y is given by

Y :(cid:0)yx2 − βy3 + 2ϑy2z + t2ρxz2 + hyz2 + tιz3 = 0(cid:1) ⊂ P(E ) × ∆,

where to emphasize the distinction between Y and Y we use the notation

e1 = β,

e2 = 2ϑ,

e3 = t2ρ,

e4 = h,

e5 = tι.

The central ﬁber is then given by

Y0 :(cid:0)y(x2 − βy2 + 2ϑyz + hz2) = 0(cid:1) ⊂ P(E ).

For every t 6= 0 there exists an associated discriminant Dt ⊂ B over which the singular ﬁbers
of Yt reside. The ﬂat limit of such discriminants as t → 0 will then be denoted by D0, and
will be referred to as the limiting discriminant associated with the family Y → ∆. The
D3 charge on the type-IIB side is then given by the sum of the Euler characteristics of the
components of the limiting discriminant (taken with multiplicities and certain contributions
from singularities). In the context at hand the associated limiting discriminant D0 is given
by

We then denote the components of D0 by

D0 : (h2ι2(ϑ2 + hβ) = 0) ⊂ B.

O : (h = 0), D1 : (ι2 = 0), D2 : (ϑ2 + hβ = 0).

The notation comes from the fact that physicists refer to O as the ‘orientifold plane’ and the
Di as ‘D-branes’. We assume that both hypersurfaces given by h = 0 and ι = 0 are smooth
and intersect transversally. Now notice that the branes D1 and D2 which arise in the limit
admit singularities (as schemes), and in such a case physicists say that the charge associated
with the brane is not just χ(Di), but χ(Di) − χ(Si), where the Si are subvarieties supported
on the singular locus of Di given by

S1 : (ι = h = 0), S2 : (ϑ = h = β = 0).

Note that Si is the intersection of the singular scheme of Di with O for both i = 1, 2. In any
case, the total D3 chrage ND3 on the type-IIB side is given by

ND3 = 2χ(O) + 2χ(D1) − χ(S1) + χ(D2) − χ(S2),

while the total D3 charge ND3 on the F-theory side is given by

ND3 = χ(Y ),

so that the tadpole relation predicted by F-theory/type-IIB duality is given by

χ(Y ) ?= 2χ(O) + 2χ(D1) − χ(S1) + χ(D2) − χ(S2).

(3.2)

6

We now show that 3.2 in fact holds, as we show it is in fact the degree-zero term of

cSM(cid:0) ϕt ∗1Y |Yt(cid:1) = cSM (ϕ0 ∗σF 1Y )

(3.3)

as given by Theorem 1.1, as the family Y → ∆ satisﬁes all the hypotheses of the theorem,
with π : P(E ) → B playing the role of f : X → B. For this, ﬁrst note that

cSM(cid:0) ϕt∗1Y |Yt(cid:1) = cSM(ϕ∗1Y ) = ϕ∗cSM(1Y ) = ϕ∗c(Y ),

so that the degree-zero term of the LHS of equation (3.3) indeed coincides with χ(Y ) (since
proper pushforwards necessarily preserve terms in degree-zero). As for the RHS of (3.3), we
now show that

cSM (ϕ0 ∗σF 1Y ) = cSM (21O + 21D1 − 1S1 + 1D2 − 1S2) ,

(3.4)

which by Theorem 1.1 yields the Chern class identity

cSM(ϕ∗1Y ) = cSM (21O + 21D1 − 1S1 + 1D2 − 1S2) ,

from which identity (3.2) immediately follows via formula (2.2).

To show (3.4), we have to compute

ϕ0∗σF 1Y ,

thus we now give a precise deﬁnition of σF 1Y . We use a characterization of σF 1Y given by
Aluﬃ [1], which we state via the following

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let Z → D be a family over a disk about the origin in C such that the total

space Z is smooth over D \{0}, denote its central ﬁber by Z0, and let ψ : eZ → Z be a proper
birational morphism such that eZ is smooth, D = ψ−1(Z0) is a divisor with normal crossings

with smooth components, and ψ restricted to the complement of D is an isomorphism (such
a ψ exists by resolution of singularities). Let δ be the constructible function on D given by

δ(p) =(m if p lies on a single component of D of multiplicity m,

otherwise.

0

We then set

σF 1Z = ψ|D ∗δ,

where ψ|D ∗ denotes the proper pushforward of constrictible functions associated with the
restriction of ψ to D (the deﬁnition of proper pushforward appears in (2.1)).

We now construct a resolution of singularities fY → Y satisfying the hypotheses of Deﬁ-
nition 3.1 in order to arrive at our associated function δ ∈ F (fY ). The singular locus of Y

is the codimension four locus given by

Ysing :(cid:0)y = x2 + h = ι = c = 0(cid:1) ⊂ P(E ) × ∆.

As the singularities of Y are away from {z = 0}, we set z = 1 and work with a local equation
for Y given by

Yloc :(cid:0)yx2 − βy3 + 2ϑy2 + t2ρx + hy + tι = 0(cid:1) ⊂ A2 × B × ∆.

We now blowup A2 × B × ∆ along {y = c = 0}, and work in the chart where the associated
pullback is given by

y 7→ X1,

c 7→ X1X2.

7

The total transform of Yloc is then given by

1 X 2
so that the proper transform of Yloc is given by

1 ) + 2ϑX 2

1 + ρX 2

fYtot :(cid:0)X1(x2 − βX 2
fYprop :(cid:0)x2 − βX 2

1 + 2ϑX1 + ρX1X 2

2 x + hX1 + ιX1X2 = 0(cid:1) ⊂ ^A2 × B × ∆,
2 x + h + ιX2 = 0(cid:1) ⊂ ^A2 × B × ∆.

It is then straightforward to show that the restriction of the blowup

fYprop → Y

is indeed a resolution of singularities satisfying the hypotheses of Deﬁnition 3.1. Now since
c = 0 pulls back to X1X2 = 0 under the blowup, the pullback of the cental ﬁber Y0 is given
by

which is a divisor with normal crossings with two smooth components given by

1 + 2ϑX1 + ρX1X 2

eY0 :(cid:0)X1X2 = x2 − βX 2
D1 = fYprop ∩ {X1 = 0} : (x2 + h + X2ι = 0) ⊂ {X1 = 0}
D2 = fYprop ∩ {X2 = 0} : (x2 − βX 2

2 x + h + ιX2 = 0(cid:1) ⊂ ^A2 × B × ∆,

1 + 2ϑX1 + h = 0) ⊂ {X2 = 0},

which intersect along

which is a smooth double-cover of B ramiﬁed over the orientifold plane O : (h = 0) ⊂ B. It
follows from Deﬁnition 3.1 that the constructible function δ we need to pushforward via the
resolution to yield σF 1Y is then given by

X = D1 ∩ D2 :(cid:0)x2 + h = 0(cid:1) ⊂ fYprop,

We then have

δ = 1D1 + 1D2 − 1X .

σF 1Y = p∗δ,

goal is then to compute

where p denotes the restriction of the resolution to the pullback of the central ﬁber eY0. Our

ϕ0∗σF 1Y = ϕ0∗ ◦ p∗δ = (ϕ0 ◦ p)∗ (1D1 + 1D2 − 1X) ∈ F (B).

For this, we use the following

Lemma 3.2. Let f : Z → V be a proper morphism of varieties and let {Ui} be a stratiﬁcation
of V with Ui locally closed such that the ﬁbers are topologically constant on each Ui. Denote
by Fi the ﬁber over Ui and write Ui = Vi \ Wi with Vi and Wi closed subvarieties of V for
each i. Then

f∗1Z =Xi

χ(Fi) (1Vi − 1Wi) .

We omit the proof as it follows directly from the deﬁnition of proper pushforward given

in (2.1). Thus to compute

(ϕ0 ◦ p)∗ (1D1 + 1D2 − 1X ) ,

we view D1, D2 and X as ﬁbrations over B and stratify B into strata over which the ﬁbers
of the corresponding ﬁbration are topologically constant.

8

As for D1, it may be viewed as a conic ﬁbration over B, with ﬁbers being smooth conics
over B \ D1, disjoint P1s over D1 \ S1, and ﬁnally two P1s meeting at a single point over S1,
where the varieties D1 and S1 are given by

Now since the Euler characteristic of a smooth conic is 2, two disjoint P1s is 4, and two P1s
meeting at a point is 3, it follows via Lemma 3.2 that the pushforward of 1D1 is given by

D1 :(cid:0)ι2 = 0(cid:1) , S1 : (ι = h = 0).

1D1 7→ 2(1B − 1D1) + 4(1D1 − 1S1) + 31S1 = 21B + 21D1 − 1S1.

As for D2, it is also a conic ﬁbration over B, with ﬁbers being smooth conics over B \ D2,
two P1s intersecting at a point over D2 \ S2, and a double line over S2, where the varieties
D2 and S2 are given by

D2 : (ϑ2 + βh), S2 : (ϑ = β = h = 0).

It then follows by computing Euler characteristics of the ﬁbers that the pushforward of 1D2
is given by

1D2 7→ 2(1B − 1D2) + 3(1D2 − 1S2) + 21S1 = 21B + 1D2 − 1S2.

Now ﬁnally since X → B is a double cover ramiﬁed over O : (h = 0) ⊂ B we have that

the pushforward of 1X is given by

Putting things all together we get

1X 7→ 21B − 1O.

thus by Theorem 1.1 we have

ϕ0∗σF 1Y = 21O + 21D1 − 1S1 + 1D2 − 1S2,

cSM(ϕ∗1Y ) = cSM (21O + 21D1 − 1S1 + 1D2 − 1S2) ,

as desired. We note that this identity which encodes the tadpole relations associated with the
weak coupling limit in degree-zero hold over a base B of arbitrary dimension, and without
any Calabi-Yau hypothesis on Y . We then close with two remarks.

Remark 3.1. We would like to point out a couple of apparent diﬀerences between the form
of our tadpole relations (and associated Chern class identities) and similar relations derived
in the physics literature. In particular, in [8], their presumed tadpole relation takes the form

2χ(Y ) = 4χ(O) + 2χ(D1) + χ(D2) − χ(S2),

where the overline over a variety denotes its pullback to the double cover X → B, where we
recall X is given by

The diﬀerence in appearance from the tadpole relation given here, namely

χ(Y ) = 2χ(O) + 2χ(D1) − χ(S1) + χ(D2) − χ(S2),

X : (x2 + h = 0) ⊂ eY0.

comes from the fact that we prefer to state the tadpole relations in terms of subvarieties of
the base B, rather than subvarieties of X, which the physicists prefer to do. Working in
the double cover then produces certain factors of two to appear in the physicist’s identities
which don’t appear ours. Another diﬀerence in our approach we would like to point out is
that while in the physics literature the tadpole relations and associated Chern class identities

9

are ﬁrst guessed and then veriﬁed by explicit computation, Theorem 1.1 yields the identities
from ﬁrst principles, without computing any Chern classes.

Remark 3.2. One curious aspect of D3 charge on the type-IIB side is that when an irre-
ducible component Di of the limiting discriminant diﬀerent from the orientifold O is singular,
the contribution of Di to the D3 charge is not χ(Di) but rather χ(Di) − χ(Si), where Si is
the singular scheme of Di intersected with O. By singular scheme we mean the subscheme of
Di corresponding to the ideal generated by its deﬁning equation and its partial derivatives.
For example D1 is given by

D1 : (ι2 = 0) ⊂ B,

thus its singular scheme is given by

D1sing : (ι = 0) ⊂ B,

so that S1 : (ι = h = 0) ⊂ B is precisely D1sing ∩ O. Ad hoc explanations for negative
contributions to the D3 charge coming from singularities were given in the physics literature
for the case of D2 [6], but in all examples known to our knowledge, the negative contribution
to the D3 charge for a singular brane is precisely the Euler characteristic of its singular
scheme intersected with O, and moreover this may be incorperated into a general deﬁnition
of ‘orientifold Euler characteristic’.
In particular, if D is an irreducible component of a
limiting discriminant diﬀerent from the orinetifold plane corresponding to a weak coupling
limit of F-theory, we propose to deﬁne the orientifold Euler characteristic of D to be

χo(D) = mχ(D) − χ(S ∩ O),

where m is the multiplicity of D and S denotes its singular scheme. With this deﬁnition all
known examples of tadpole relations may be written as

χ(Y ) = 2χ(O) +Xi

χo(Di).

In any case, Theorem 1.1 yields the proper negative contribution to the D3 charge coming
from the singularities of branes without any need for further explanation from the mathe-
matical viewpoint.
