Bilateral Boundary Control of One-Dimensional First- and
Second-Order PDEs using Inﬁnite-Dimensional Backstepping

Rafael Vazquez and Miroslav Krstic

Abstract— This paper develops an extension of

inﬁnite-
dimensional backstepping method for parabolic and hyperbolic
systems in one spatial dimension with two actuators. Typically,
PDE backstepping is applied in 1-D domains with an actuator at
one end. Here, we consider the use of two actuators, one at each
end of the domain, which we refer to as bilateral control (as
opposed to unilateral control). Bilateral control laws are derived
for linear reaction-diffusion, wave and 2 × 2 hyperbolic 1-D
systems (with same speed of transport in both directions). The
extension is nontrivial but straightforward if the backstepping
transformation is adequately posed. The resulting bilateral
controllers are compared with their unilateral counterparts in
the reaction-diffusion case for constant coefﬁcients, by making
use of explicit solutions, showing a reduction in control effort as
a tradeoff for the presence of two actuators when the system
coefﬁcients are large. These results open the door for more
sophisticated designs such as bilateral sensor/actuator output
feedback and fault-tolerant designs.

I. INTRODUCTION

The backstepping method has proved itself to be an
ubiquitous method for PDE control. First developed to design
feedback control laws and observers for one-dimensional
reaction-diffusion PDEs [9], it has since been applied to
many other systems including, among others, ﬂow con-
trol [15], [20], thermal loops [17], nonlinear PDEs [16],
hyperbolic 1-D systems [3], [6], [11], multi-agent deploy-
ment [12], wave equations [13], and delays [10]. Some of the
more striking features of backstepping include the possibility
of ﬁnding explicit control laws in some cases (see e.g. [18])
or even designing adaptive controllers [14].

Backstepping has been typically applied to PDEs for-
mulated in 1-D domains, with actuation at one end of
the domain. This paper develops backstepping for the case
when two actuators are available, one at each end of the
domain. We refer to this situation as bilateral control—as
opposed to the single actuator case, denoted as unilateral
control. The bilateral case is a nontrivial extension of the
method that needs a speciﬁc formulation of the backstepping
transformation to be able to solve the stabilization problem.
More concretely, whereas the backstepping transformation
in the unilateral case is formulated as an integral starting
at the non-actuated end, in the bilateral case the integral
starts at the middle of the domain. Based in this simple
idea it
is straightforward to extend the unilateral results
and even obtain explicit results for the constant coefﬁcient
case. Explicit solutions allow to easily compare the resulting
bilateral controllers. We compare unilateral and bilateral

controllers for the reaction-diffusion equation, and show that,
when the system coefﬁcients are large, there is a considerable
reduction in control effort as a tradeoff for the presence of
two actuators.

The focus of this paper is on design, stabilization, and
ﬁnding explicit controllers when available. Closed-loop well-
posedness is assumed,
in the most basic Sobolev space
appropriate for each type of PDE. Due to the linearity of the
equations and the good properties of backstepping a detailed
well-posedness analysis would be rather straightforward but
lengthy and dependent on the type of the equation. We only
study the well-posedness of the kernel equations which is
critical towards ﬁnding the control laws.

This paper presents bilateral control

The results of this paper were originally inspired by [19],
where the problem of stabilization of reaction-diffusion equa-
tions in balls of arbitrary dimension is addressed. Since a ball
in dimension 1 is actually an interval, and the boundaries are
the two ends; then, applying the formulas of [19] one obtains
the results that will be shown in Section V. In this paper the
authors explore similar results for other types of equations.
linear
reaction-diffusion, wave and 2 × 2 hyperbolic 1-D systems.
For 2×2 hyperbolic 1-D systems, only the case of both states
having the same speed of transport is considered. The reason
to only consider this particular case is that the analysis of
the resulting kernel equations is straightforward. It is also
the case used in the paper to build the control design for the
wave equation. Finally, it allows to derive explicit solutions
in the constant-coefﬁcient case. The case of different speeds
of transport can also be addressed, however while writing
this paper the authors learnt of a new paper [1] that already
solves this more general and challenging problem.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we
solve the bilateral control problem for a reaction-diffusion
equation. In Section III we continue with a bilateral design
for 2 × 2 hyperbolic 1-D systems with the same speed of
transport. This design is then adapted for wave equations in
Section IV. Explicit controllers for all cases are presented in
Section V. We then compare bilateral and unilateral results in
Section VI. We ﬁnish in Section VII with some concluding
remarks.

II. REACTION-DIFFUSION PDES

Consider the reaction-diffusion equation

ut = uxx + λ(x)u,

(1)

(cid:90) x

−x

for t > 0, in the domain1 x ∈ [−L/2, L/2], with  > 0,
λ(x) a differentiable function, and with boundary conditions

u(t, L) = U1(t),
u(t,−L) = U2(t),

(2)
(3)

where U1 and U2 are actuator variables. For sufﬁciently large
λ(x) > 0, (1)–(3) is open-loop unstable.

To design feedback control laws for U1 and U2, consider

a transformation deﬁned as

(cid:90) x

w(t, x) = u(t, x) −

K(x, ξ)u(t, ξ)dξ,

(4)

with w(t, x) (the target variable) verifying the following
system (target system):

wt = wxx,

w(t, L) = w(t,−L) = 0.

(5)
(6)

Working out the kernel equations as in the unilateral case

(see e.g. [9]), one ﬁnds

in the hourglass-shaped domain T = {(x, ξ)
: x ∈
[−L, L], ξ ∈ [−|x|,|x|}, represented in Fig. 1. It is possible
to separate the domain into two: T = T1 ∪ T2, where
T1 = {(x, ξ) : x ∈ [0, L],−x ≤ ξ ≤ x} and T2 = {(x, ξ) :
x ∈ [−L, 0], x ≤ ξ ≤ −x}, as shown in Fig. 1. It is clear
that the interior of these domains is disjoint and it follows
that the kernel equations can be solved separately in each
of the domains. In addition, it is easy to see that if the
equations are well-posed in the domain T1 they must be in T2
by a symmetry argument (switching variables from (x, ξ) to
(ˆx, ˆξ) = (−x, ξ) maps the domain T2 into T1 and leaves the
structure of the equations unchanged, except for some sign
switch). Once the kernel equations are solved, the control

the domain T as follows

U1 =

(11)

Then, and assuming the backstepping transformation is in-
vertible, the state u(t, x) “inherits” the stability properties
of the target state w(t, x), whose origin,
in view of its
deﬁning PDE (5)–(6), is clearly exponentially stable. Now,
since inverting the backstepping transformation amounts to
solving a Volterra integral equation of the second kind, then
inversion is always possible under very mild conditions [5]
(for instance if the kernel is at least bounded, which it is in
our case).

Thus,

the problem of designing an stabilizing control
law is reduced to solving (7)–(9) so that (10)–(11) can be
implemented and showing it is at least bounded. We ﬁrst
address the question of existence and uniqueness in the
domain T1. Consider the new variables α = x + ξ and
β = x − ξ and the kernel K = G(α, β) a function of the
new variables. Written in terms of (α, β), (7)–(9) become

Gαβ(α, β) =

(13)

(14)
in the domain T1 which is now expressed as T1 =
{(α, β) : α > 0, β > 0, α + β ≤ 2L}.
The problem in this form is known as Goursat’s prob-
lem [4], which interestingly appears in the theory of non-
linear wave propagation [8]. It is known that if λ is at least
differentiable then there is a unique C 1(T1) solution [7]. This
can also be shown directly by transforming (12)-(14) into an
integral equation and then applying the method of successive
approximations, as in [9].
A. An equivalent problem

The problem of stabilization of systems of reaction-
diffusion equations with the same diffusion coefﬁcients was
addressed in [2]. Now we show the relationship between that
result and the bilateral control problem for reaction-diffusion
equations. The ﬁrst step is to “fold” the state u into a 2 × 2
system (u1, u2), deﬁning

so that

The resulting kernels would be the four “pieces” of the kernel
K in the transformation (4):

K(x, ξ) =

x ≥ 0, 0 ≤ ξ ≤ x,
K11(x, ξ),
x ≥ 0, 0 ≥ ξ ≥ −x,
K12(x,−ξ),
K21(−x, ξ),
x ≤ 0, 0 ≤ ξ ≤ −x,
K22(−x,−ξ), x ≤ 0, 0 ≥ ξ ≥ x.

Therefore the methods of [2]—with some modiﬁcations to
account for boundary conditions (20)—can potentially be
applied to solve reaction-diffusion bilateral control problems.

III. ONE-DIMENSIONAL 2 × 2 HYPERBOLIC LINEAR
Consider the following system

ut = −ux + c1(x)u + c2(x)v,
vt = vx + c3(x)u + c4(x)v,

(24)
(25)
evolving in x ∈ [−L, L], and assume that  > 0 and the
coefﬁcients ci(x) are differentiable. The boundary conditions
are:

v(t, L) = U2(t),

u(t,−L) = U1(t),

(26)
and we need to ﬁnd U1(t) and U2(t) to stabilize the system.
As in Section II the approach to design U1(t) and U2(t)
is to seek a mapping that transforms (24)–(25) into a target
system with adequate properties, in this case

αt = −αx + c1(x)α,
βt = βx + c4(x)β,

(27)
(28)

with boundary conditions

α(t,−L) = β(t, L) = 0,

(29)
whose origin is exponentially stable (in fact it converges to
zero in ﬁnite time), and then U1(t), U2(t) will be chosen to
realize the transformation.
A. Backstepping transformation and kernel equations

To transform the original system (24)–(25) into the target
system (27)–(28), we look for a mapping deﬁned as follows:

Introducing (30)–(31) into (27)–(28), one obtains the equa-
tions that the kernels must satisfy. Deﬁning

Both systems of equations evolve separately in the domain
T , shown in Figure 1. Since they are structurally equivalent,
it sufﬁces to analyze one of them, for instance (44)–(47), and
as in Section II it is enough to consider just the subdomain
T1. It is easy to see that the problem has a solution because
the boundaries are characteristic (see ﬁg. 2).

(73)
where V1 and V2 have been artiﬁcially introduced. Since
(70)–(73), with the coefﬁcients ci(x) found as combinations
of α and λ, one can ﬁnd the values of V1 and V2 by applying
the design of Section III. Then, the values of U1 and U2 are
found from solving the differential equation
˙U1 = V1 − ux(t,−1)
˙U2 = −V2 + ux(t, 1)

with initial conditions for U1 and U2 consistent with, respec-
tively, u(t,−1) and u(t, 1).

problems posed in this paper, in the constant coefﬁcient
case. These expressions are subsequently used to compare
unilateral and bilateral control laws.

VI. COMPARISON BETWEEN UNILATERAL AND

BILATERAL FEEDBACK LAWS

Unilateral and bilateral feedback laws can be compared by
setting one of the controllers to zero (for instance U1 = 0)
and using the single-sided control design. We concentrate
on constant-coefﬁcient cases because the explicit laws are
available and simplify the comparison and only consider
reaction-diffusion equations. The results are similar for the
other equations and they will be more thoroughly studied in
a future journal publication.

For reaction-diffusion equations, the control law is [9]

domain is 2L. To compare (90) and (80)–(81), one can use
the L1 norm of the kernels. Call J1 and J2 the L1 norm of
the unilateral and bilateral kernels, respectively. Notice that
the L1 norm of the kernel in (80), changing ξ to L − ξ, is
the same as the kernel in (81). Then, one has

which is exclusively a function of δ. In Fig. 3 J1 and J2
are represented for different values of δ. It can be seen that
for smaller values of δ (in concrete, δ < 2), the unilateral
kernel is smaller, however for larger values of δ (δ > 2), the
bilateral kernel grows more slowly.

Besides a comparison in terms of magnitude, it is clear that
a bilateral design can be made fault-tolerant, in the sense that
it can withstand the loss of one of the actuators. Once the
failure is detected, it is sufﬁcient to switch to a unilateral
control
law with the remaining controller. Detecting the
failure would require the use of an additional observer, which
would require at least one measurement sensor. Fault-tolerant
designs will be explored in future works.

VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

This paper presents bilateral control

linear
reaction-diffusion, wave and 2 × 2 hyperbolic 1-D systems.
For 2 × 2 hyperbolic 1-D systems, only the case of both
states having the same speed of transport is considered. The

laws for

control design for the wave equation is built upon the design
for hyperbolic systems. The unilateral and bilateral control
laws are compared for reaction-diffusion equations, showing
that the bilateral control law requires less total effort (despite
using two actuators) when the system coefﬁcients are large.
These results open the door for more sophisticated designs
such as bilateral sensor/actuator output feedback and fault-
tolerant designs that will be explored in future publications.
