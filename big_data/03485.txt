Nanometer-scale Exchange Interactions Between Spin Centers in Diamond

Optical Science and Technology Center and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242

V. R. Kortan, C. S¸ahin, and M. E. Flatt´e

Exchange interactions between isolated pairs of spin centers in diamond have been calculated,
based on an accurate atomistic electronic structure for diamond and any impurity atoms, for spin-
center separations up to 2 nm. The exchange interactions exceed dipolar interactions for spin center
separations less than 3 nm. NV− spin centers, which are extended defects, interact very diﬀerently
depending on the relative orientations of the symmetry axis of the spin center and the radius vector
connecting the pair. Exchange interactions between transition-metal dopants behave similarly to
those of NV− centers. The Mn–Mn exchange interaction decays with a much longer length scale than
the Cr–Cr and Ni–Ni exchange interactions, exceeding dipolar interactions for Mn–Mn separations
less than 5 nm. Calculations of these highly anisotropic and spin-center-dependent interactions
provide the potential for design of the spin-spin interactions for novel nanomagnetic structures.

A single spin, such as from a defect or dopant, can
control the properties of a nanomagnetic system[1], sug-
gesting pathways to constructing novel magnetic mate-
rials or magnetic behavior through designed assembly
e.g. of spins in metals, insulators, and semiconductors[2–
8]. Spin centers in wide-gap semiconductors such as
diamond exhibit exceptionally long room-temperature
spin coherence times[9], permitting coherent interactions
among such spin centers over length scales of many
nanometers, and the corresponding shaping of spin dy-
namics in the spin assemblies. As the interactions oc-
cur through weak, long-range, largely isotropic dipolar
interactions[10, 11] the interaction eﬀects on spin dynam-
ics are slow (less than 1 µeV). Continued improvement
of control in spin-center positioning, such as through ion
implantation[4, 12, 13], will lead to assemblies with short-
range coupling, where exchange interactions may domi-
nate over dipolar interactions, producing anisotropic[3]
interactions that are orders of magnitude greater than
dipolar interactions. The current focus on NV− centers
in diamond, due especially to the convenience of its lev-
els and optical selection rules for spin initialization and
readout[14], may also shift to other spin centers that are
easier to address and manipulate electrically, especially
transition-metal dopants that possess partially-ﬁlled d
levels[15, 16].

Here we construct a highly-accurate theoretical de-
scription of the spin center in bulk diamond, and a
very eﬃcient theoretical methodology to evaluate the
exchange-coupling between spins in diamond, including
both NV− centers and transition-metal spin centers. We
include the weak spin-orbit interaction in bulk diamond
and the strong spin-orbit interaction of a transition-metal
dopant, as well as the dependence of an NV− spin cen-
ter’s interaction on the N-V axis direction. We ﬁnd that
exchange interactions dominate over dipolar interactions
for spin-center separations smaller than 3 nm, except
for the more delocalized Mn spins, which are exchange-
dominated for separations less than 5 nm. The theo-
retical techniques that have been previously applied to
diamond ﬁnd calculations of spin-spin interactions very

challenging, either (as with density functional theory[15–
17]) due to the very large supercell sizes required for such
calculations, or (as with symmetry-based group-theory
analyses[18]) due to the inability to constrain the prob-
lem to a very small number of experimentally-determined
quantities. Our approach is a rigorously tested spds∗ de-
scription of the bulk electronic structure[19] and a set
of eﬀective impurity potentials, including for d states,
that replicate the energies of the spin-center states found
in density functional theory calculations or experimen-
tal measurements. Once those are known the elec-
tronic properties of the pair are eﬃciently evaluated us-
ing a Green’s function-based Koster-Slater method[20]
as described in Ref.
[21], and here extended to the
spds∗ system required to accurately describe bulk dia-
mond and the d levels of transition-metal dopants. This
approach[21], by exactly solving for the electron propaga-
tor in the regions between defects, permits calculations
of the exchange interaction of a defect pair to proceed
with a rapid speed that is independent of the defect sep-
aration.

The Hamiltonian for a point defect (impurity atom or
vacancy) has the form H = H0 + V , where H0 is the
spds∗ Hamiltonian of Ref. 19 and

neighbor sites are labeled by R1-R4. The spin-orbit po-
tential has been calculated from atomic energies[22–24]
and using the Land´e interval rule. Spin-orbit interac-
tions are positive for angular-momentum shells less than
half full, and negative otherwise. For transition-metal
dopants, to position the d states of correct tetrahedral
symmetry (t2 or e) at the correct locations within the di-
amond band gap, U os magnetic and nonmagnetic poten-
tials are determined for the t2 and e states, and reported
in Table I. U nn = 0 for transition-metal dopants. For
the NV− spin center, defect potentials are only required
on the p orbitals, however the shift in the atomic posi-
tions requires nonzero defect potentials on the nearest
neighbors as well. These values are reported in Table II.
We calculate the retarded Green’s function for the bulk
Hamiltonian H0, G0(k, ω) = [ω−H0(k)+iδ]−1, and from
this the real-space Green’s function G0(Ri, Rj, ω), where
G0 is a matrix with rows and columns labeled by (cid:96), m,
and s. The properties of the defects, either point defects
or pairs, are determined from solving the Dyson equation
in real space,

G(ω) = [I − G0(ω)V ]

−1 G0(ω) .

Due to the limited number of positions in real space
where the potential is non-zero, Eq. (2) can be solved
rapidly once the G0(Ri, Rj, ω) have been tabulated.

transition-metal spin-1 dopants, Ni and Cr. Within the
diamond band gap, the Cr spin center forms one doubly-
degenerate spin-up and one doubly-degenerate spin-down
e level as well as one triply degenerate spin-up and one
triply-degenerate spin-down t2 level. The ground state
for Cr has two electrons in the spin-up e state and the
rest empty. The Ni dopant levels are arranged diﬀerently,
with the t2 levels in the gap and the e levels below the
edge of the valence band, showing as a broad resonance.
The t2 levels for Ni show a visible splitting in Fig. 1 due
to the large spin orbit coupling for Ni. The ground state
for the Ni spin center has two electrons in the spin-up t2
states. As found in Ref. 15 and 16 with density functional
theory calculations, the Cr ground state possesses more
spectral weight on the site of the dopant than the Ni
ground state, with a ratio of ∼ 2:1. The construction
of the NV− center requires tracking diﬀerent mid-gap
levels. The NV− center exhibits four levels in the gap, the
lower two have a1 symmetry and the upper two are spin-
split, orbitally-degenerate ex and ey levels, all of which
originate from p orbitals (t2 character)[17]. The ground
state for the NV− center ﬁlls electrons up through the
spin-up ex and ey states.

These trends are reﬂected in the real space proba-
bility density of the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) of each of the spin centers in Fig. 2. The
ground state spins for each dopant in diamond are Fe:
spin 0, Mn and Co: spin 1/2, and NV−, Cr and Ni: spin
1. All of the transition-metal dopant HOMOs show the
same overall spatial symmetry regardless of spin, which
is expected because the propagation of electron waves in
the host material most determines the probability den-
sity symmetry[21]. The Fe, Mn, and Cr dopants all have
e-like HOMOs whereas the NV−, Co and Ni spin cen-
ters have t2-like HOMOs, and therefore among the point
defects Fe, Mn and Cr all have larger wave function prob-

ability near the dopant location and appear less extended
than the Co and Ni wave functions.

Once the properties of an individual spin center have
been determined the exchange interaction between two
can be calculated by comparing the energies of ﬁlled mid-
gap states for parallel and antiparallel alignment of the
spin centers[3, 21]. The exchange interaction found be-
tween pairs of transition metal spin centers is shown in
Fig. 3. For pairs spaced along the [1¯10] direction the Mn-
-Mn pair has the largest and slowest-decaying exchange,
followed by Cr–Cr pairs and then Ni–Ni pairs. The
exchange interaction between Cr and Ni appears often
smaller than either the Cr–Cr or Ni–Ni exchange, which
is likely due to the smaller hybridizations of the energy
levels of Cr and Ni (relative to homodopant pairs) due to
their diﬀerent energies. Along the [001] direction the Ni-
-Ni pair does not decrease logarithmically for the closest
pair spacings. The exchange interaction along the [1¯11]
interaction is the largest for the Ni–Ni pair and excluding
the Ni–Ni pair it is the direction for which the exchange
interaction between other transition metal pairs is the
least. At pair spacings greater than ∼ 2 nm the energy
broadening of the calculation (10 µeV) limits the ability
to resolve the exchange splittings, and for several pairs
of spin centers the exchange interaction is obscured at
shorter distances by this broadening. At the ﬁrst nearest
neighbor spacing in the [001] direction and the ﬁrst and

second nearest neighbor spacing in the [1¯10] direction the
energy broadening in the calculation is on the order of 1
meV and thus the error for these points is larger than the
others. The exchange interaction is strongly anisotropic
and can vary greatly depending on the direction of in-
teraction, the energy of the spin center states as well as
the symmetry of the HOMO (which produces the great-
est hybridization and splitting), ie e or t2. For all these
calculations the strength of the exchange interaction ex-
ceeds the dipolar interaction (also shown on Fig. 3) by
orders of magnitude. Only for spin center separations
in excess of 3 nm would the dipolar interaction become
comparable to the exchange interaction.

The NV− center exhibits an additional form of ex-
change interaction anisotropy, corresponding to the de-
pendence of the exchange interaction on the relative
orientation of the NV− center atoms themselves. The
vacancy and the nitrogen can either be oriented near-
parallel to [1¯11] or near-perpendicular to [1¯11]. This in-
troduces four orientations for a pair of NV− centers, (1)
both near-parallel to [1¯11], (2) both near-perpendicular
to [1¯11] and (3) and (4) corresponding to types with one
of the pair near-parallel and the other near-perpendicular
to [1¯11], pictured in Fig. 4. The choice of near-parallel
or near-perpendicular orientation of the NV− center has
a large eﬀect on the exchange interaction. Due to the
geometry of NV− center pairs along the [1¯10] direction,
for some pairs the ﬁrst nearest neighbor and in one case
the second nearest neighbor exchange interactions are not
presented due to overlapping impurity potentials. As ex-
pected from the symmetry of the diﬀerent pairs, in some
directions there are pairs which have similar exchanges.
For example along the [001] direction the exchange in-
teractions between the near-parallel near-perpendicular
(blue) and near-perpendicular near-parallel (green) over-
lay each other in the plot as do the values for the near-

exchange interactions, in excess of the dipolar interac-
tions between spin centers, even at 2-3 nm separations.
Transition metal dopants in diamond oﬀer distinct prop-
erties compared to NV− spin centers due to the inclu-
sion of d-orbitals and the resulting spin-orbit interaction
that permits high-speed electrical control of spin[25] and
spin-sensitive optical selection rules. Additionally, based
on the exchange between a Ni and Cr dopant pair, one
could envision a quantum register where information is
transferred to the spin of a Ni spin center and then that
information is stored in the less accessible Cr spin.

perpendicular near-perpendicular (red) and near-parallel
near-parallel pairs (black). At the largest spacings the
near-parallel near-perpendicular (blue) and near-parallel
near-parallel (black) pairs have the largest exchange in-
teractions along [1¯11] in direct contrast with the tran-
sition metal pairs where the interactions along [11¯1] are
in general the smallest. Once again, beyond these pair
spacings the exchange interaction is hidden by the 10 µeV
broadening included in the homogenous Green’s function
calculations.
The exchange interactions between pairs of transition
metal pairs of spin centers and pairs of NV− centers are
comparable in magnitude. For all the species and orienta-
tions of pairs at the calculated separations the exchange
interactions exceed the dipole-dipole interaction between
two electrons regardless of dipole orientation. Taking a
linear ﬁt to the logarithmic decrease of the exchange in-
teraction along the [1¯10] direction, the exchange interac-
tion between two Mn equals the dipolar interaction at 47
˚A; this crossover occurs at roughly 22 ˚A and 25 ˚A for the
other transition metal pairs and diﬀerent orientations of
NV− pairs respectively.
We have constructed a detailed and accurate theoreti-
cal description of NV− and transition-metal point defect
spin centers in diamond. The exchange interactions for
pairs of transition metal spin centers are on the order,
and in some cases, larger than the exchange interaction
for pairs of NV− centers. The spin 1 transition metal
dopants, Cr–Cr and Ni–Ni, show experimentally relevant
