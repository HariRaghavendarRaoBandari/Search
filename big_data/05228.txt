Abstract

We evaluate the fermion condensate and the expectation values of the charge and current
densities for a massive fermionic ﬁeld in (2+1)-dimensional conical spacetime with a magnetic ﬂux
located at the cone apex. The consideration is done for both irreducible representations of the
Cliﬀord algebra. The expectation values are decomposed into the vacuum expectation values and
contributions coming from particles and antiparticles. All these contributions are periodic functions
of the magnetic ﬂux with the period equal to the ﬂux quantum. Related to the non-invariance of the
model under the parity and time-reversal transformations, the fermion condensate and the charge
density have indeﬁnite parity with respect to the change of the signs of the magnetic ﬂux and
chemical potential. The expectation value of the radial current density vanishes. The azimuthal
current density is the same for both the irreducible representations of the Cliﬀord algebra.
It
is an odd function of the magnetic ﬂux and an even function of the chemical potential. The
behavior of the expectation values in various asymptotic regions of the parameters are discussed
in detail. In particular, we show that for points near the cone apex the vacuum parts dominate.
For a massless ﬁeld with zero chemical potential the fermion condensate and charge density vanish.
Simple expressions are derived for the part in the total charge induced by the planar angle deﬁcit
and magnetic ﬂux. Combining the results for separate irreducible representations, we also consider
the fermion condensate, charge and current densities in parity and time-reversal symmetric models.
Possible applications to graphitic nanocones are discussed.

Introduction

Fermionic ﬁeld theoretical models in three-dimensional spacetime rise in a number of physical prob-
lems. In particular, the long-wavelength description of a variety of planar condensed matter systems

can be formulated in terms of the Dirac-like theory. The examples include models of high-temperature
superconductivity, graphene, d-density-wave states and topological insulators (for reviews see [1, 2]).
The long-wavelength dynamics, equivalent to relativistic Dirac fermions with a controllable mass, is
exhibited by ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice [3]. Another motivation comes from the
connection of three-dimensional models to high temperature behavior in 4-dimensional ﬁeld theories
[4]. Field theories in three dimensions also provide simple models in particle physics. Because of one
dimension less they are easier to handle.

Three-dimensional theories exhibit a number of interesting features, such as ﬂavour symmetry
breaking, parity violation, fractionalization of quantum numbers, that make them interesting on their
own. Some special features of gauge theories, including the supersymmetry breaking, have been
discussed in [5, 6]. In three-dimensions, topologically non-trivial gauge invariant terms in the action
provide masses for the gauge ﬁelds. The topological mass term introduces an infrared cutoﬀ in vector
gauge theories providing a way for the solution of the infrared problem without changing the ultraviolet
behavior [6]. If absent at the classical level, this term is generated through quantum corrections [7]. In
the presence of an external gauge ﬁeld, fermions in three-dimensional spactime induce a topologically
nontrivial vacuum current having abnormal parity [7, 8].
In models with fermions coupled to the
Chern-Simons gauge ﬁeld the Lorentz invariance should be spontaneously broken [9]: there exists
a state with nonzero magnetic ﬁeld and with the energy lower than the lowest energy state in the
absence of the magnetic ﬁeld. Another interesting feature of the models in two spatial dimensions is
the possibility of the excitations with fractional statistics (anyons) [10].

The presence of a background gauge ﬁeld gives rise to the polarization of the fermionic vacuum.
As a consequence, various types of quantum numbers are generated. In particular, charge and current
densities are induced [11]. The vacuum currents induced by cylindrical and toroidal topologies of
background space have been investigated in [12]. Applications are given to the electronic subsystem
of graphene made cylindrical and toroidal nanotubes, described in terms of the eﬀective Dirac-like
theory. Vacuum expectation values of the current density in locally de Sitter and anti-de Sitter
backgrounds with toroidally compactiﬁed spatial dimensions are studied in [13] and [14]. Among the
most interesting topics in the studies of (2+1)-dimensional theories is the parity and chiral symmetry-
breaking. In particular, it has been shown that a background magnetic ﬁeld can serve as a catalyst
for the dynamical symmetry breaking [15]. A key point of these considerations is the appearance of
a nonzero fermion condensate induced by the magnetic ﬁeld. This phenomenon may be important in
the physics of high-temperature superconductivity [16].

In the present paper we investigate the ﬁnite temperature eﬀects on the fermion condensate and on
the expectation values of the charge and current densities for a massive fermionic ﬁeld with nonzero
chemical potential in a (2+1)-dimensional conical spacetime in the presence of a magnetic ﬂux located
at the cone apex. The corresponding vacuum expectation values in the presence of a circular boundary,
concentric with the cone apex, have been studied in [17]-[19]. The ﬁnite temperature eﬀects on the
fermionic condensate and current densities in models with an arbitrary number of toroidally compact
spatial dimensions are discussed in [20]. The ﬁnite temperature charge and current densities in the
geometry of a (3+1)-dimensional cosmic string with magnetic ﬂux have been recently investigated in
[21].

The outline of the paper is as follows. In the next section we consider the fermion condensate for a
two-component spinor ﬁeld realizing the irreducible representation of the Cliﬀord algebra. Expressions
are derived for the separate contributions from particles and antiparticles for general values of the
planar angle deﬁcit and for the magnetic ﬂux. Various asymptotic regions of the parameters are
considered in detail. The expectation values of the charge and current densities are investigated in
Sections 3 and 4, respectively. We provide simple expressions for the topological part in the total
charge, induced by the planar angle deﬁcit and by the magnetic ﬂux. The expectation values in the
model with parity and time-reversal invariance are discussed in Section 5. These expectation values
are obtained by combining the results from the previous section for two irreducible representations of

2

the Cliﬀord algebra. The main results are summarized in Section 6. In the Appendix we derive the
relations used in the evaluation of the topological part in the total charge.

2 Fermion condensate

We consider a fermionic ﬁeld ψ(x) on background of (2+1)-dimensional spacetime assuming that the
ﬁeld is in thermal equilibrium at temperature T . In this section we evaluate the fermion condensate
(FC) deﬁned as the expectation value h ¯ψψi = tr [ˆρ ¯ψψ], with ¯ψ = ψ†γ0 being the Dirac adjoint and
the angular brackets denote the ensemble average with the density matrix ˆρ = Z −1eβ( ˆH−µ′ ˆQ), where
β = 1/T . Here ˆH is the Hamilton operator, ˆQ is a conserved charge with the related chemical potential
µ′ and Z = tr [e−β( ˆH−µ′ ˆQ)]. The FC is among the most important characteristic for the system under
consideration. In particular, it plays an important role in the models of dynamical breaking of chiral
symmetry.

The background geometry is described by the (2+1)-dimensional line element

ds2 = gµν dxµdxν = dt2 − dr2 − r2dφ2,

(2.1)

where 0 6 φ 6 φ0. For φ0 < 2π, this line element describes (2+1)-dimensional conical spacetime
with the planar angle deﬁcit 2π − φ0. We will discuss the case of two-components spinor ﬁeld re-
alizing the irreducible representation of the Cliﬀord algebra. Assuming the presence of the external
electromagnetic ﬁeld with the vector potential Aµ, the ﬁeld operator obeys the Dirac equation

(iγµDµ − sm) ψ = 0, Dµ = ∂µ + Γµ + ieAµ,

(2.2)

where Γµ is the spin connection and e is the charge of the ﬁeld quantum. Here, s = +1 and s = −1
correspond to inequivalent irreducible representations of the Cliﬀord algebra in (2+1)-dimensions (see
Section 5). With these representations, the mass term violates the parity and time-reversal invariances.
In the coordinates corresponding to (2.1), the gamma matrices can be taken in the representation

with l = 1, 2 and q = 2π/φ0.

In what follows, in the region r > 0, we consider the gauge ﬁeld conﬁguration Aµ = (0, 0, A),
where A2 = A is the covariant component of the vector potential in the coordinates (t, r, φ). For
the corresponding physical component one has Aφ = −A/r. This corresponds to an inﬁnitely thin
magnetic ﬂux Φ = −φ0A located at r = 0. As it will be seen below, in the expressions for the
expectation values the parameter A enters in the form of the combination

where q = 2π/φ0. We decompose it as

α = eA/q = −eΦ/(2π),

α = α0 + n0,

|α0| < 1/2,

Let us denote by ψ(+)

with n0 being an integer. It is the fractional part α0 which is responsible for physical eﬀects.

σ (x) a complete orthonormal set of the positive- and negative-
energy solutions of the equation (2.2). These solutions are labeled by a set of quantum numbers
σ. Expanding the ﬁeld operator ψ(x) in terms of the functions ψ(±)
σ (x) and using the commutation
relations for the annihilation and creation operators, the following decomposition is obtained for the
FC:

h ¯ψψi = h ¯ψψi0 + h ¯ψψi+ + h ¯ψψi−.

σ′ (x) = δσσ′ , with γ being the determinant of the spatial metric tensor. The part
in the FC corresponding to the vacuum expectation value, h ¯ψψi0, has been investigated in [18] and
here we will be mainly concerned with the ﬁnite temperature eﬀects.
For the evaluation of the FC in accordance with (2.7) we need to know the mode functions. The
general solution of the radial equation for these functions contains the part regular at the origin and
the part which diverges at r = 0. Under the condition

(2.8)

the irregular modes are eliminated by the normalizability condition.
In the case 2|α0| > 1 − 1/q,
there are irregular normalizable modes and for the unique identiﬁcation of the functions an additional
boundary condition is required at the origin. In the literature it has been already shown that the
standard procedure for the self-adjoint extension of the Dirac Hamiltonian gives rise to a one-parameter
family of boundary conditions in the background of an Aharonov-Bohm gauge ﬁeld [22]. The speciﬁc
value of the parameter is related to the physical details of the magnetic ﬁeld distribution inside a
more realistic ﬁnite radius ﬂux tube (for a more detailed discussion and for speciﬁc models with ﬁnite
radius magnetic ﬂux see [23]). The idealized model under consideration is a limiting case of the latter.
Following [17], for irregular modes we consider a special case of boundary conditions at the cone
apex, when the bag boundary condition is imposed at a ﬁnite radius, which is then taken to zero. The
bag boundary condition ensures the zero ﬂux of fermions and this corresponds to an impenetrable ﬂux
tube. The corresponding mode functions have the form

In the mode-sum formulas (2.6) and (2.7) one has Pσ = PjR ∞
0 dγ, with the summation over j =
±1/2,±3/2, .... The parameter α is the magnetic ﬂux measured in units of the ﬂux quantum. In the
case when the parameter α is half of an odd integer the mode with j = −α should be considered
separately. The corresponding mode function is presented in [17].
In order do not complicate the
consideration, in the following discussion we will exclude this case. Note that, under the condition
2|α0| > 1 − 1/q, the irregular mode corresponds to j = −n0 − sgn(α0)/2. The expectation values for
general case of boundary condition at the cone apex are considered in a way similar to that described
below. The corresponding results diﬀer by the contribution of the irregular mode only.

Using the mode functions (2.9), the contributions to the FC from particles and antiparticles are

(2.14)

where c is a positive constant and Iν(y) is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind. Inserting into
(2.13), the separate contributions h ¯ψψi± are expressed in terms of the series

I(q, α, z) =Xj

Iβj (z).

(2.15)

The function I(q, α, z) is periodic with respect to α with the period 1. Hence, if we present the
parameter α in the form (2.4), then I(q, α, z) does not depend on n0 and I(q, α, z) = I(q, α0, z). For
the second series, appearing after the application of (2.14), one has Pj Iβj+ǫj (z) = I(q,−α0, z). As a
result, the expression on the right of (2.13) is transformed as

(2.18)

The prime on the sign of the summation in (2.17) means that the term l = 0 and the term l = q/2 = p
for even values of q should be taken with the coeﬃcient 1/2. In the range 1 6 q < 2, the sum over l
in (2.17) is absent. Note that for q being an even integer, q = 2p, for the function (2.18) one has

f (q, α0, y) = 2(−1)p cos(πqα0) sinh((qα0 − 1/2)y) sinh(py),

(2.19)

and the integrand in (2.17) is regular in the lower limit of integration.

is the contribution coming from the l = 0 term in the right-hand side of (2.17) and it coincides with
the corresponding quantity in (2+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime (q = 1) in the absence of the
magnetic ﬂux (α0 = 0).

For an integer q, the expression (2.21) is essentially simpliﬁed for special values of α0 deﬁned by

α0 =

n + 1/2 − {q/2}

q

,

(2.25)

where n is an integer and the ﬁgure braces stand for the fractional part of the enclosed expression.
The allowed values for n are obtained from the condition |α0| < 1/2. For α0 from (2.25) one has
cos(qπ(1/2 − δα0)) = 0 and, hence, both the functions fl(q, α0, y) in (2.23) become zero. As a result,
the integral term in the ﬁgure braces of (2.21) vanishes.
Returning to the general values of the parameters q and α0, ﬁrst we will consider the case with

|µ| 6 m. By using the relation

n=0 instead of P∞

This contribution can be combined with the sum over n in (2.31) containing the factor cosh(nβµ)
writing P∞′
n=1. The prime on the summation sign means that the term n = 0 should
be taken with the coeﬃcient 1/2. The FC is a periodic function of the magnetic ﬂux with the period
equal to the ﬂux quantum. Note that it has no deﬁnite parity with respect to the reﬂections α0 → −α0
and µ → −µ. This is related to the non-invariance of the model under the parity (P -) and time-reversal
(T -) transformations (see the discussion in Section 5). Note that the FC in the vacuum state is an
even function of α0.

The general formula (2.31) is further simpliﬁed in various special cases. For a massless fermionic
ﬁeld, because of the condition |µ| 6 m, we should also assume that µ = 0 and the FC vanishes. In
the special case when the magnetic ﬂux is absent, one has α0 = 0, and the equation (2.31) becomes

The n = 0 terms in (2.34) and (2.35) correspond to the vacuum expectation values.

Let us consider the asymptotic behavior of the FC in the limiting regions of the parameters. For
points near the apex of the cone two separate regions of the values of the parameter α0 should be
distinguished. For 2|α0| < 1 − 1/q, the thermal part is ﬁnite on the apex and the corresponding
expression is directly obtained from (2.31) putting r = 0. Recall that, in this case, all the modes
(2.9) are regular at the apex. For 2|α0| > 1 − 1/q the integrals diverge on the apex.
In order to
ﬁnd the leading term in the asymptotic expansion over the distance from the origin, we note that for
points near the apex the dominant contribution to the integrals in (2.31) comes from large values of
y. Expanding the integrands, it can be seen that

Hence, for 2|α0| > 1 − 1/q the ﬁnite temperature part diverges on the apex as r2ρ−1. The vacuum
expectation value h ¯ψψi0 behaves as 1/r and it dominates for small r.
Now we turn to the investigation of the asymptotics for the FC at low and high temperatures. In
the low temperature limit the main contribution to the thermal part comes from the n = 1 term and
to the leading order we ﬁnd

Here, the term with l = 0 is the contribution of the Minkowskian part h ¯ψψi(M ). Hence, for |µ| < m,
at low temperatures the thermal contribution in the FC is suppressed by the factor e−β(m−|µ|).
The representation (2.31) is not well adapted for the investigation of the high temperature limit.

In the high temperature limit, T r ≫ 1, the dominant contribution to the series over n in (2.39)
comes from the terms with n = 0 and n = −1 and from the part containing the factor µ− iπ(2n + 1)T .
In the case q > 2 the leading contribution corresponds to the term with l = 1 and we obtain

For q < 2 the sums over l are absent. At high temperatures the dominant contribution to the
integrals in (2.39) comes from the region near the lower limit of integration. Assuming that T ≫

and, at high temperatures, the FC is dominated by this part. The contributions induced by the conical

For the investigation of the FC at large distances from the origin it is convenient to use the repre-
sentation (2.39). The corresponding procedure is similar to that for the high temperature asymptotic
and the dominant contribution comes from the terms with n = 0 and n = −1. Considering the
asymptotic expression for the Macdonald function with large arguments, for q > 2 we obtain

Now let us turn to the case |µ| > m. For µ > m (µ < −m) the contribution of the antiparticles
(particles) to the FC is evaluated in a way similar to that described above and the corresponding
expression is given by (2.27) with the lower (upper) sign. The total FC is expressed as

The second term in the right-hand side of (2.48) is the contribution of particles (for µ > m) or
antiparticles (for µ < −m) ﬁlling the states with the energies m 6 E 6 |µ|. This term is ﬁnite on the
apex for 2|α0| < 1 − 1/q and diverges as 1/r1−2ρ for 2|α0| > 1 − 1/q. The vacuum contribution near
the apex behaves as 1/r and it dominates. At large distances from the apex, p0r ≫ 1, the corrections
induced by the conical defect and by the magnetic ﬂux are dominated by the part coming from the
particles or antiparticles (the second term in the right-hand side of (2.48) with the contribution of
l = 0 excluded). This part decays oscillatory with the amplitude decreasing as 1/r3/2. Note that the
decay of the vacuum part for a massive ﬁeld is exponential. In the case of a massless ﬁeld, m = 0, the
vacuum part of the FC vanishes and the formula (2.48) simpliﬁes to

In this case, the only nonzero contribution comes from particles or antiparticles and the FC is an odd
function of both the chemical potential and the magnetic ﬂux.

In the discussion above we have assumed that the ﬁeld ψ(x) is periodic along the azimuthal
direction. We may consider a more general case where the spinor ﬁeld obeys the quasiperiodicity
condition

ψ(t, r, φ + φ0) = eiχψ(t, r, φ),

(2.51)

with a constant phase χ. The corresponding expressions for the expectation values are obtained from
those presented above (and in what follows) with α given by the formula

Note that χ and A are changed by a gauge transformation whereas their combination in the right-hand
side of (2.52) is gauge invariant.

α = χ/(2π) + eA/q.

3 Charge density

In this and in the following section we shall investigate the expectation value of the fermionic current
density given by hjνi = e tr [ˆρ ¯ψ(x)γν ψ(x)]. Similarly to the case of the FC, the current density is
decomposed as

with the ﬁnite temperature eﬀects. The details of the calculations are similar to those for the FC and
the main steps only will be given.

We start with the charge density that corresponds to the component ν = 0 in (3.1). By us-
ing the mode functions (2.9), for the contributions from the particles and antiparticles we get the

For a massless ﬁeld and in the case of the zero chemical potential, µ = 0, the contributions from the

the case for a massive ﬁeld.

Note that, in the case of zero chemical potential, the Minkowskian part in the charge density vanishes
as a consequence of the cancellation of the contributions coming from particles and antiparticles. The
magnetic ﬂux acts on these contributions in diﬀerent ways and there is no such a cancellation for the
topological part. The n = 0 term in (3.11) corresponds to the vacuum expectation value of the charge
density. In the case of a massless ﬁeld with the zero chemical potential the charge density vanishes.
Note that, for a massive ﬁeld, the charge density has indeﬁnite parity with respect to the change of
the sign for α0, α0 → −α0, and for µ, µ → −µ. This is related to the fact that, in the presence of the
mass term, the model under consideration is not invariant under the T - and P -transformations.
The quantity hj0it = hj0i − hj0i(M ) gives the contribution to the charge density coming from
the planar angle deﬁcit and from the magnetic ﬂux. For brevity we shall call it as topological part.
In Figure 1 we have plotted this part versus the parameter α0. Recall that the charge density is a
periodic function of α0 with the period 1. The full and dashed curves correspond to the irreducible
representation with s = 1 and s = −1, respectively. The numbers near the curves are the values of
q. The graphs are plotted for µ/m = 0.25, mr = 0.5, T /m = 0.5. For this example, the contribution
of the terms in (3.11) containing the factor s dominates. These terms are odd with respect to the
reﬂection α0 → −α0. Note that for the same values of µ/m = 0.25, T /m = 0.5, for the Minkowskian
part one has hj0i(M ) ≈ 0.015em2.

Figure 1: Topological part in the charge density as a function of the parameter α0 for ﬁelds realizing
the irreducible representations with s = 1 (full curves) and s = −1 (dashed curves). The numbers
near the curves are the corresponding values of q. The graphs are plotted for µ/m = 0.25, mr = 0.5,
and T /m = 0.5.

The general formula (3.11) is simpliﬁed in special cases. For integer values of q and for the values
of α0 given by (2.25), the integral terms vanish. In the absence of the magnetic ﬂux and for general
values of q, the charge density is given by

and the charge density diverges as 1/r1−2ρ. The vacuum expectation value, hj0i0, diverges in the limit
r → 0 as 1/r and near the apex it dominates in the total charge density. Though the charge density
diverges on the apex, this divergence is integrable and the total charge induced by the planar angle
deﬁcit and by the magnetic ﬂux is ﬁnite (see below).

Now, let us analyze the limits of low and high temperatures. At low temperatures, for a ﬁxed
value of mr, the main contribution to the ﬁnite temperature part of the charge density comes from
the n = 1 term in (3.11) and it is given by

For q < 2 the summs over l in (3.17) are absent and the dominant contribution to the integrals over
y comes from the region near the lower limit of integration. In this case the eﬀects induced by the
conical defect and magnetic ﬂux are suppressed by the factor e−2πrT . In all cases, for µ 6= 0, at high
temperatures the charge density is dominated by the Minkowskian part hj0i(M ) with the asymptotic

In the case of zero chemical potential the Minkowskian part vanishes. For points not too close to the
cone apex, the contributions induced by the conical defect and by the magnetic ﬂux are exponentially
small.

The full curves in Figure 2 present the dependence of the topological part in the charge density on
the temperature. The dashed curves correspond to the charge density in Minkowski spacetime in the
absence of the magnetic ﬂux, m−2hj0i(M )/e. The numbers near the curves are the values of the ratio
µ/m. The graphs are plotted for q = 1.5, α0 = 0.25, mr = 0.5, and for the irreducible representation
with s = 1.

In the same way as for the FC, the representation (3.17) also is convenient for the investigation
of the charge density at large distances from the origin. As before, the corresponding procedure is

with the functions g1(u) and g2(u) from (2.49). The appearance of the second term is related to
the presence of antiparticles (for µ < −m) or particles (for µ > m) in the states having the energy
m 6 E 6 |µ|. In the absence of the planar angle deﬁcit and magnetic ﬂux (q = 1, α = 0), the l = 0
term remains only and for the charge density we obtain the expression: hj0i(M )
0/(2π).
Subtracting from the right-hand side of (3.24) the term l = 0, we obtain the charge density induced
by the planar angle deﬁcit and by the magnetic ﬂux. At large distances from the cone apex the decay
of this part in the charge density is oscillatory with the amplitude decreasing as 1/r3/2. Similar to
the case |µ| 6 m, the charge density is ﬁnite at the apex for 2|α0| < 1 − 1/q and diverges in the case
2|α0| > 1 − 1/q. The divergence in the second case is integrable, as 1/r1−2ρ. For a massless ﬁeld the
vacuum charge density is zero and from (3.25) we get the following expression

In this case the charge density at zero temperature is the same for both the irreducible representations
of the Cliﬀord algebra. It is an odd function of the chemical potential and an even function of the
magnetic ﬂux.

In Figure 3 we displayed the charge density as a function of the distance from the cone apex for
diﬀerent values of q (the numbers near the curves). The left panel presents the topological part in the
charge density for the ﬁeld realizing the irreducible representation with s = 1 and for µ/m = 0.25,
α0 = 0.25, T /m = 0.5. In the right panel the ratio hj0i/hj0i(M ) is plotted at zero temperature for a
massless fermionic ﬁeld. The full and dashed curves correspond to α0 = 0.25 and α0 = 0, respectively.
Note that for α0 = 0.25 and q = 2 one has hj0iT =0 = hj0i(M )
T =0.

with ∆Q0 = seα0/2. For |µ| < m, in the zero temperature limit one has limT →0 ∆Q = ∆Q0 and the
topological part of the charge coincides with that for the vacuum state.
In the case |µ| > m, the charge at zero temperature diﬀers from the vacuum charge ∆Q0. It is
obtained by the integration of the right-hand side of (3.24), omitting the term l = 0 (the Minkowskian
part). By taking into account that

with the same ∆Q0 as in (3.30). For a given sign of the chemical potential, the zero temperature charge
is completely determined by the topological parameters of the model. Note that in the evaluation of
the integral (3.31) with the function g1(u) from (2.49) one cannot change the order of integrations.
In order to escape this diﬃculty, we introduce in the integrand the function e−by, b > 0. With this
function, changing the integrations order, the integral over y involving the Bessel function is evaluated
by using the formula from [25]. Then, after the evaluation of the integral over x, we take the limit
b → 0. For |µ| = m the expression (3.32) coincides with that obtained from (3.30) in the limit T → 0.

4 Current density

In this section we consider the expectation value of the spatial components for the current density.
First of all we can see that the current density along the radial direction is zero, hj1i = 0, and the
only nonzero component is along the azimuthal direction. The contributions to the azimuthal current
coming from the particles and antiparticles are obtained from (3.3) by using the mode functions (2.9).
For the physical component, hjφi, connected to the contravariant one by the relation hjφi = rhj2i, one
gets the following expression:

Note that the expectation value of the azimuthal current density does not depend on the parameter
s in (2.2) and it is the same for both the irreducible representations of the Cliﬀord algebra.

By making use of the recurrence relation for the Bessel function we can show that

As is seen, the azimuthal current is an odd function of the parameter α0. Note that for the zero
chemical potential, µ = 0, the particles and antiparticles give the same contributions to the total
current density. As before, we will consider the cases |µ| 6 m and |µ| > m separately.

it is an odd function of α0 and an even function of the

chemical potential. For an integer q and for special values of α0, given by (2.25), the integral terms
in (4.6) and (4.7) vanish.

In Figure 4, the azimuthal current density is plotted versus the parameter α0 for µ/m = 0.25,
mr = 0.5, T /m = 0.5. The numbers near the curves are the values of q. As we have mentioned, the
current density is an odd function of α0.

For the massless ﬁeld, due to the condition µ 6 m, we also should take µ = 0. Using the asymptotic

At the cone apex, the thermal part in the azimuthal current density vanishes as r for 2|α0| < 1−1/q
and as r2ρ for 2|α0| > 1 − 1/q. In the ﬁrst case the leading term is obtained directly from the n 6= 0
term in (4.6) putting r = 0. This is reduced to the substitutions cnl = cn(y) = mnβ. In the second
case, the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the thermal part is found in the way similar to
that we have used for the FC and has the form

5 Expectation values in parity and time-reversal symmetric models

In the discussion above we have considered a fermionic ﬁeld realizing the irreducible representation of
the Cliﬀord algebra. In this representation, the mass term in the Lagrangian density is not invariant
under the parity and time-reversal transformations (P - and T -transformations). In order to recover
the P - and T -invariance, we note that in (2+1)-dimensions the γ2 matrix can be represented in two
(s) = −isp−g22γ0γ1, with s = ±1. As a consequence, the Cliﬀord algebra
diﬀerent ways: γ2 = γ2
has two inequivalent representations corresponding to the upper and lower signs. Our choice in (2.3)
corresponds to the representation with the upper sign. Consider two two-component spinor ﬁelds,
(s)Dµ − m)ψ(s), where
γµ
(s) = (γ0, γ1, γ2
(s)). We can see that, by suitable transformations of the ﬁelds (see, for example,
[26]), this Lagrangian is invariant under P - and T -transformations (in the absence of magnetic ﬁelds).
Deﬁning new ﬁelds ψ′
(−1) = γ0γ1ψ(−1), the Lagrangian density is transformed to the
form

ψ(+1) and ψ(−1), with the combined Lagrangian density L = Ps=±1

with γµ = (γ0, γ1, γ2
(−1) satisﬁes the same equation as ψ(+1)
with the opposite sign for the mass term. We can write the Lagrangian (5.1) in terms of the four-

As is seen from (5.1), the expectation values in the corresponding models are obtained from the
formulas given above by summing the contributions from the ﬁelds ψ(+1) and ψ(−1). For the ﬁrst one
the expressions are obtained from those presented in the previous sections taking s = 1. In order to
ﬁnd the contribution of the ﬁeld ψ(−1), we note that ¯ψ(−1)ψ(−1) = − ¯ψ′

of the contributions coming from the separate irreducible representations. In Figure 7, the topological

Figure 8 for diﬀerent values of the ratio µ/m (numbers near the curves). For the other parameters we
have taken the same values as in Figure 2.

hj0i = hj0i(M ).

In summing the contributions from the spinors ψ(+1) and ψ(−1) we have assumed that the parameter
α is the same for both these spinors. However, in general, this parameter can be diﬀerent for separate
spinors. In particular, this diﬀerence can be a consequence of diﬀerent phases in the quasiperiodicity
condition (2.51) along the azimuthal direction.

Among the most important physical systems, with the low-energy sector described by a Dirac-
like theory in two spatial dimensions, is graphene. The long-wavelength excitations of the electronic
subsystem in graphene are described by a pair of two-component spinors ψ+ and ψ−, corresponding
to the two diﬀerent inequivalent points K+ and K− at the corners of the two-dimensional Brillouin
zone (see [2]). The separate components of these spinors give the amplitude of the wave function on
the A and B triangular sublattices of the graphene hexagonal lattice. Graphitic cones are obtained
from planar graphene sheet if one or more sectors with the angle π/3 are excised and the remainder is
joined. The opening angle of the cone is connected to the number of the removed sectors, Nc, by the
relation φ0 = 2π(1− Nc/6) , with Nc = 1, 2, . . . , 5. All these angles have been observed in experiments
[27]. At the apex of the graphitic cone the hexagon of the planar graphene lattice is replaced by a
polygon having 6− Nc sites. The periodicity conditions for the combined bispinor Ψ = (ψ+, ψ−) under
the rotation around the cone apex are discussed in [28]. For even values of Nc these conditions do not
mix the spinors ψ+ and ψ−, and we can apply the formulas given above.

6 Conclusion

We have investigated the expectation values of the FC, charge and current densities for a massive
fermion ﬁeld with nonzero chemical potential in thermal equilibrium on the background of (2+1)-
dimensional conical spacetime with an arbitrary planar angle deﬁcit in the presence of a magnetic
ﬂux located at the cone apex. For both the spinor ﬁelds realizing the two inequivalent representations
of the Cliﬀord algebra, the expectation values are decomposed into three contributions coming from
the vacuum expectation values, from the particles and from the antiparticles. All these contributions
are periodic functions of the magnetic ﬂux with the period equal to the ﬂux quantum. The vacuum
expectation values have been investigated earlier and here we are mainly concerned with the ﬁnite
temperature eﬀects.

In the case |µ| 6 m, the FC is presented in the form (2.31), where s = 1 and s = −1 correspond
to two irreducible representations of the Cliﬀord algebra. With these representations, the mass term
breaks the P - and T -invariances and, related to this, the FC has no deﬁnite parity with respect to
the reﬂections α0 → −α0 and µ → −µ. For a massless ﬁeld with the zero chemical potential the
FC vanishes. In the massive case, for integer values of the parameter q and for special values of the
magnetic ﬂux given by (2.25), the integral terms in (2.31) vanish. In the absence of the magnetic
ﬂux, the FC is given by (2.34) and it has opposite signs for two irreducible representations with the
same modulus. Another special case corresponds to Minkowski bulk in the presence of a magnetic ﬂux
(q = 1) with the FC given in (2.35). In order to clarify the behavior of the FC, we have considered
diﬀerent asymptotics of the general formula. The ﬁnite temperature part in the FC is ﬁnite on the
apex for 2|α0| < 1 − 1/q and diverges as 1/r1−2ρ, with ρ = q (1/2 − |α0|), in the case 2|α0| > 1 − 1/q.
The divergence is related to the irregular mode. For a massive ﬁeld, the vacuum FC diverges on
the apex as 1/r and it dominates for points near the origin. At low temperatures and for |µ| < m
the ﬁnite temperature eﬀects are suppressed by the factor e−(m−|µ|)/T . In order to investigate the
high temperature asymptotic, for the FC we have provided an alternative representation (2.39). At
high temperatures, for points not too close to the origin, the FC is dominated by the Minkowskian
part. The eﬀects induced by the planar angle deﬁcit and by the magnetic ﬂux are suppressed by the
factor e−2πrT sin(π/q) for q > 2 and by the factor e−2πrT for q < 2. The asymptotics at large distance
from the cone apex are given by the expressions (2.45) and (2.46) for the cases q > 2 and q < 2,
respectively. The expression for the FC in the case |µ| > m takes the form (2.47) with the upper and
lower signs corresponding to µ < −m and µ > m. Now, the FC at zero temperature, given by (2.48),
in addition to the vacuum part contains a contribution coming from the antiparticles (µ < −m) or
particles (µ > m) ﬁlling the states with the energies m 6 E 6 |µ|. For points near the apex, the zero
temperature FC is dominated by the vacuum part whereas at large distances the contributions from
particles or antiparticles dominate.

The contributions from particles and antiparticles to the charge density are given by (3.5) and are
further transformed to (3.7) in the case |µ| 6 m. For the total charge density one has the representation
In the case of a massless ﬁeld with the zero chemical potential, as a consequence of the
(3.11).
cancellation of the contributions from particles and antiparticles, the charge density vanishes. Similar
to the FC, the charge density has indeﬁnite parity with respect to the changes of the signs for α0 and
µ. In the absence of the magnetic ﬂux, the general expression is simpliﬁed to (3.13) and the charge
density is an odd function of the chemical potential. The charge density for another special case of
Minkowski bulk with magnetic ﬂux is given by (3.14). The behavior of the thermal part in the charge
density near the apex is similar to that for the FC. In this region the total charge density behaves
as 1/r and is dominated by the vacuum part. At large distances from the origin, the behavior of the
topological part in the charge density is given by (3.21) and (3.22) for q > 2 and q < 2, respectively. In
this region one has an exponential suppression of the topological contributions. At low temperatures
and for |µ| < m the charge density is dominated by the vacuum part and the thermal eﬀects are
suppressed by the factor e−(m−|µ|)/T . At high temperatures, the main contribution comes from the

26

Minkowskian part and the topological part behaves as e−2πrT sin(π/q) and e−2πrT in the cases q > 2
and q < 2, respectively. For the values of the chemical potential |µ| > m, the expression for the charge
density takes the form (3.23) with the upper and lower signs corresponding to µ < −m and µ > m.
The contribution from the antiparticles or particles to zero temperature charge density is given by
the second term in the right-hand side of (3.24). For a massless ﬁeld this term survives only and the
expression is simpliﬁed to (3.25).

The total charge induced by the planar angle deﬁcit and by the magnetic ﬂux is ﬁnite. For |µ| 6 m
it is given by the expression (3.30) with ∆Q0 being the vacuum charge. In the case |µ| > m, the charge
at zero temperature receives an additional con tribution from particles or antiparticles, depending on
the sign of the chemical potential. This contribution is given by the second term in the right-hand
side of (3.32). For a given sign of the chemical potential it is completely determined by the topological
parameters of the model, q and α0.

In the problem under consideration, the only nonzero component of the current density is along the
azimuthal direction. This component does not depend on the representation of the Cliﬀord algebra.
For the chemical potential in the region |µ| 6 m, the corresponding expectation value is presented as
(4.6). The current density has deﬁnite parity with respect to the reﬂections α0 → −α0 and µ → −µ:
it is an odd function of α0 and an even function of µ. In particular, the current density vanishes in the
absence of the magnetic ﬂux. For a massless ﬁeld the general expression is simpliﬁed to (4.8) and in
Minkowski bulk with the magnetic ﬂux one has the expression (4.9). The thermal part of the physical
component of the azimuthal current vanishes on the apex as r for 2|α0| < 1 − 1/q and as r2ρ in the
case 2|α0| > 1 − 1/q. The vacuum current diverges as 1/r2 and dominates for points near the apex.
At low temperatures and for |µ| < m the ﬁnite temperature contribution is given by the second term
in the right-hand side of (4.10) with the exponential suppression. At high temperatures the current
density is suppressed by the factor e−2πrT sin(π/q) in the case q > 2 and by e−2πrT for q < 2. The
large distance asymptotics are given by (4.15) and (4.16) in these two regions of q. For |µ| > m, the
expression for the current density has the form (4.17) and the zero temperature current density is
given by (4.18). The latter consists two parts: the vacuum current and the current from particles or
antiparticles ﬁlling the states with the energies m 6 E 6 |µ|.
One can construct parity and time-reversal symmetric (2+1)-dimensional fermionic model by com-
bining spinors realizing the two irreducible representations of the Cliﬀord algebra. The corresponding
Lagrangian density can be transformed to the form (5.1) with s = ±1. The expectation values in this
model are obtained by using the formulas for separate representations (see (5.2)). The resulting FC is
an even functions of both the chemical potential and the parameter α0. The charge density is an odd
function of the chemical potential and an even function of α0. The vacuum charge density vanishes.

A Appendix

In this appendix we derive the formulas used in Section 3 for the simpliﬁcation of the expressions of
the total charge. Let us consider the integral

P =Z ∞

0

dx e−x [I(q, α0, x) − ex/q] ,

(A.1)

where I(q, α0, x) is given by (2.15) with α = α0. From the formula (2.17) it follows that the integral is
convergent. We evaluate it in two diﬀerent ways. Firstly, we use the expression (2.15). Inserting into
(A.1), we note that the separate integrals with the ﬁrst and second terms in the square brackets diverge.
In order to have the right for separate integrations, we write the integral as limλ→1R ∞
0 dx e−λx [···].
For λ > 1 both the integrals converge separately. By using the standard result for the integral with
the modiﬁed Bessel function [25], after the summation over j and the limiting transition λ → 1 we get

1 − q2
12q

P =

+ α0 (qα0 − 1) .

(A.2)

In the second approach for the evaluation of the integral (A.1) we use the representation (2.17).

After the elementary integration over x one ﬁnds

In the special case α0 = 0 this gives:

Other relations are obtained from (A.4) by diﬀerentation with respect to α0.
