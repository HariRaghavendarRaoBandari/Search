Topological insulators have been proposed to be best characterized as bulk

magnetoelectric materials which show response functions quantized in terms

of fundamental physical constants. It has been predicted that this manifests

as Faraday and Kerr rotations that are quantized in units of the ﬁne structure

constant α = e2/20hc. In this work we use a charge-transfer-doping prepa-
ration to lower the chemical potential of Bi2Se3 ﬁlms into the bulk gap and as
low as ∼ 30 meV above the Dirac point, and then probe their low-energy elec-
trodynamic response with high-precision time-domain terahertz polarimetry.

As a function of ﬁeld, a crossover from semi-classical cyclotron resonance to

1

a quantum regime was observed. In this regime, although the DC transport

is still semi-classical, we ﬁnd quantized Faraday and Kerr rotations the size

of which is set by the ﬁne structure constant, which provides evidence for the

long-sought axion electrodynamics and the topological magnetoelectric effect

of the topological insulator’s surface states. Among other aspects, the unique

time structure used in such measurements allow us a direct measure of the ﬁne

structure constant based on a topological invariant of a solid-state system for

the ﬁrst time.

Topological phenomena in condensed matter physics provide some of the most precise mea-

surements of fundamental physical constants. The measurement of the quantum conductance

G0 = e2/h from the quantum Hall effect (1) and the ﬂux quantum Φ0 = h/2e from the Joseph-

son effect (2, 3) provide the most precise value for Planck’s constant h. In the last number of

years a new class of materials in the form of topological insulators has been discovered (4–6).

These are materials in which topological properties of the bulk wavefuctions give rise to a topo-

logically protected surface metal with a novel massless Dirac spectrum. It has been proposed

that topological insulators are best characterized not as surface conductors, but as bulk magne-

toelectrics (7, 8) with a quantized magnetoelectric response coefﬁcient whose size is set by the

ﬁne structure constant α = e2/20hc. Such a topological measurement could provide precise

values for three fundamental physical constants: the electric charge e, Planck’s constant h, and

the speed of light c in a solid-state context.

Magnetoelectrics are materials in which a polarization can be created by an applied magnetic

ﬁeld or a magnetization can be created by an applied electric ﬁeld and have been topics of

interest for decades (9). Representative examples of magnetoelectric (ME) materials are Cr2O3
(10) with an E·B ME coupling of the form proposed by Dzyaloshinskii and multiferroic BiFeO3
(11) with an E × B ME coupling. Topological insulators can be characterized as special E · B

2

magnetoelectrics (7,8), which in the topological ﬁeld theory can be shown to be a consequence
2πE·B added to the usual Maxwell Lagrangian (7). Here α

was shown that if time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is preserved then three-dimensional insulators
can be divided into two classes of materials, in which the θ term in Lθ is either 2π(N + 1
2)
(topological) or 2π(N ) (conventional band insulators) (7). Here N is an integer that indicates

the highest fully ﬁlled Landau level (LL) of the surface when TRS is broken weakly. θ can be

formulated as a bulk quantity modulo a quantum (here 2π) in much the same way as the electric

polarization P in a ferroelectric can only be deﬁned as a bulk quantity moduluo a dipole quantum

that depends on the surface charge (12). An analogy can be made between the physics described

here to that of the hypothetical axion particle that was proposed to explain charge conjugation

parity symmetry violation (CP violation) in the strong interaction by Wilczek (13) and hence a

topological magnetoelectric effect (TME) of this kind has been called axion electrodynamics.

The axion has not been observed in particle physics experiments, but one may study the analogs

effect in the context of topological insulators.

In the limit where a TRS breaking ﬁeld is ﬁnite, but vanishingly small at the surface, and the

surface chemical potential is tuned to the Dirac point a modiﬁed Maxwell’s equations can be

derived (see supplementary information (SI) section 1 ) from the full Langragian. The modiﬁed

Gauss’s and Amp`ere’s laws read

The consequences of axion electrodynamics and the TME are the additional source and cur-

rent terms related to the derivatives of θ in these modiﬁed Maxwell’s equations. The additional

3

source term leads to an effect whereby an electric charge placed near the surface of a TI cre-

ates an image magnetic monopole (14). The additional current term gives a novel half-integer

quantum Hall effect (QHE) on the TI surface (7). Although there has been indirect evidence for

half-integer QHE effects in gated TI BiSbTeSe2 exfoliated ﬂakes (15), gated (Bi1−xSbx)2Te3

thin ﬁlms (16) and surface charge-transfer doped pure Bi2Se3 ﬁlms (17) at very high magnetic

ﬁelds, it is generally not straightforward to observe the QHE in a conventional transport style

experiment as one does with a 2D electron gas (2DEG) with leads connected to sample edges

as TIs have a closed surface with no boundaries. It is desirable then to use non-contact probes

such as Faraday and Kerr rotations (7,18,19), which have been predicted to be quantized in the

units of the ﬁne structure constant α. One can proceed from the modiﬁed Amp`ere’s law Eq.

20 in conjunction with the usual Faraday’s law to derive the reﬂection and transmission coefﬁ-

cients for a traveling wave incident on a TI surface (See SI section 2 ). In an applied magnetic

ﬁeld, one ﬁnds that for a TI thin ﬁlm on a simple dielectric substrate, the Faraday rotation in the

quantum regime is

tan(φF ) =

where n ∼ 3.1 is the THz range index of refraction of the sapphire and Nt, Nb are the highest
fully ﬁlled LL of the top and bottom surfaces, which depend on the chemical potential and size

of the TRS breaking ﬁeld. Note that unlike the typical case of a magnetoelectric which must

break both TRS and inversion symmetry, a TI in magnetic ﬁeld breaks only TRS. This means

that the magnetoelectric effect can be considered as such only locally for a particular surface as

the surface trivially breaks inversion. The net effect of considering a local TRS breaking ﬁeld

that is oppositely directed for the two surfaces in our thin ﬁlm geometry gives Eq. 25.

There have been a number of inter-related challenges in realizing the TME on both the ma-

terials and instrumentation side. First, one must have a negligible level of bulk carriers and a

4

low chemical potential at the surface, but most known topological insulators suffer from inad-

vertent bulk doping. A metallic gate used to gate away charge carriers in transport experiments

cannot be used in an optical experiment because it would have its own Faraday effect. Second,

as the topological ﬁeld theory is derived for the translationally invariant case, one may expect

that it will only apply when the TRS breaking perturbation is strong enough to overcome dis-

order and establish a surface quantum Hall effect. Third, to reveal the TME it is required that

the probe frequencies and temperatures be well below the effective cyclotron frequency of the
surface states, which for small ﬁelds is ωc = e|B|vF
¯hkF
the Fermi wave vector). In practice this put the relevant frequency in the sub-THz part of the

(where vF is the Fermi velocity and kF is

electromagnetic spectrum, which has been a traditionally difﬁcult frequency range to charac-

terize materials in. Fourth, THz range experiments with their long wavelengths require large

uniform samples of at least a few mm in spatial extent. Fifth, as the size of the effect is set by

the ﬁne structure constant, the expected rotations are expected to be very small and well beyond

the capacity of conventional THz range polarimetry.

Despite these challenges, due to a number of innovations, we have succeeded in measuring
the quantized TME effect using time-domain THz spectroscopy (TDTS) (1 THz ∼ 4.14 meV),
using recently developed low-density and high-mobility Bi2Se3 molecular beam epitaxy ﬁlms,

in conjunction with a novel high-precision polarimetry technique (20). TDTS is a powerful tool

to study the long-wavelength (low-energy) electrodynamics of topological insulators. Samples

are thin ﬁlms of Bi2Se3 grown by molecular beam epitaxy with a recently developed recipe

that results in true bulk insulating TIs with low surface chemical potential. These ﬁlms were

further treated in situ by a thin charge transfer layer of deposited MoO3 that further decreases
the carrier density. MoO3 is semiconductor with a gap ∼ 3 eV (21) and does not contribute to
Faraday rotation. Details of the ﬁlm growth can be found in Ref. (17).

In Fig. 1(a), we show the real part of the conductance of new generation Bi2Se3 ﬁlms with

5

and without the MoO3 layer in zero magnetic ﬁeld as compared to the conductance of an older

(but still excellent (22, 23)) generation of Bi2Se3 ﬁlms. As shown in previous work (22, 23),

the complex conductance can be characterized by a low-frequency Drude term peaked at zero
frequency, a phonon term peaked at ∼ 1.9 THz and a lattice polarizability contribution ∞
(See SI section 4 for details). The total area below the Drude conductance is the Drude spectral

weight and is a function of the carrier density. One can see that MoO3 lowers the spectral weight

and therefore the carrier density. In previous work (22, 23) we have shown that this spectral

weight is independent of ﬁlm thickness establishing a principle surface transport channel. In

the present case there is a weak dependence of this spectral weight on thickness below 10 QL as

shown in SI section 4. We believe this is because for this generation of samples, the substantial

dopants come from bulk defects (as opposed to surface defects in earlier generation samples)

that move to the surface and work as surface carriers. Additionally it is likely that MoO3 is

more effective in reducing carrier density in thinner samples.

As a part of the magneto-THz experiments described below, we measure the low ﬁeld cy-

clotron resonance frequency and ﬁnd the effective mass (See SI section 3 for raw data). As show

in Fig. 1(b), a decreased effective mass from 0.15 me to 0.07 me is observed through charge

transfer to MoO3, which is consistent with the known band structure for Dirac surface states.

Both bulk states or a trivial 2DEG from an accumulation layer will exhibit a carrier-density

independent mass. Moreover 0.07 me is lower than any reported bulk or 2DEG effective mass.

Converting the spectral weight or effective mass to chemical potential using the known band

structure of Bi2Se3 these new ﬁlms with MoO3 have EF of 30 - 60 meV above the Dirac point

and in the bulk gap when an equal contribution from the two surface states is assumed (See SI

section 1 ). Below, we focus only on the thin ﬁlms treated with MoO3.

Having identiﬁed the topological surface states and veriﬁed the low Fermi energy of these

ﬁlms, we explore their low-frequency Faraday rotation. The experimental conﬁguration is

6

shown in Fig. 2(a). We measure complex Faraday rotation through TDTS with the polar-

ization modulation technique (20, 24). The Faraday rotation is a complex quantity in which the

real part is the rotation of the major axis of the ellipse and the imaginary part is related to the

ellipticity as shown in Fig. 2(b). The full-ﬁeld data of a 10 QL sample is shown in Fig. 2(c)

(d). At low ﬁelds (< 4 T), the Faraday rotation shows semi-classical cyclotron resonance, as

demonstrated by the shifting of the inﬂection point (close to the zero value) in the real part and

the shifting of the minimum in the imaginary part with ﬁelds as discussed in Ref. (24). Typi-

cal cyclotron frequency is marked by red arrows for data at 2.5 T for instance. For the 10 QL

sample, above 5 T, the inﬂection point in the real part of the Faraday rotation moves above our

high frequency range and the low-frequency tails becomes ﬂat and overlaps even higher ﬁeld

data. In our TDTS measurements, top and bottom states are measured simultaneously and so

the quantized Faraday rotation is given by Eq. 25.

Since the resolution of our THz polarimetry is within 1 mrad, we conclude that 10 QL

sample enters the quantized regime when ﬁeld is above 5.75 T with its low-frequency tails

falling on the expectation for the 5 2α

12 QL and 16 QL, the low-frequency Faraday rotations falls on the 2 2α

1+n plateau. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 2(e) 6 QL, 8 QL,
1+n and 7 2α
1+n
plateaus respectively. Aside from the ﬁlling factor differences, the only qualitative differences

1+n, 4 2α

1+n, 7 2α

between samples is that thicker samples have a narrower magnetic ﬁeld range where the Faraday

rotation is quantized because they have a slightly higher carrier density and ﬁlling factor at the

same magnetic ﬁelds (See SI section 4 ).

In our experiment, we measure the top and bottom surfaces of the thin ﬁlm simultaneously.

Essential for our interpretation in terms of the TME is that we can treat the top and bottom

surfaces independently. Previous ARPES work (25) showed that the hybridization gap from top

and bottom surfaces was an exponential function of thickness for ﬁlm thicknesses less than 6

QL. Extrapolating this data to thicker ﬁlms (as done in Ref. (26)) gives a hybridization gap ∆

7

of 1 meV at 10 QL. Treating the hybridization between top and bottom surfaces as a simple two

level system (and assuming a strictly linear massless Dirac spectrum) with degenerate Dirac

points on top and bottom surfaces, shows that the mixing between top and bottom surfaces

will be of order ∆/4EF . For our 10 QL sample this is approximately 0.005 which should

be considered negligible. 12 QL and 16 QL samples have even smaller hybridization gaps

predicted of 0.3 meV and 0.01 meV respectively and hence have even less overlap of the surface

states. Note that theoretical calculations of ﬁnite-size effects in Bi2Se3 give a systematically

even smaller ∆ at a given thickness, which if realized would even further suppress any mixing

of top and bottom surfaces (27).

We can contrast our experiments with DC transport that have shown quantized Hall resis-
tivity plateaus in these ﬁlms only above ∼ 24 T as shown for a typical sample 8 QL ﬁlm in
Fig. 2(f). When an external magnetic ﬁeld is applied perpendicular to the ﬁlms, top and bottom

surface states are gapped due to LL formation while the side surfaces parallel to the magnetic

ﬁeld remain still gapless because a small in-plane magnetic ﬁeld can be treated as a shift of the

Dirac points (28). As the quantized Hall resistance in a usual transport measurement on a 2DEG

arise from ballistic transport in 1D edge channels when leads are attached, one must go to very

high magnetic ﬁelds for a TI in order to not have the non-chiral side states contributes (17). In

the present case, THz radiation is focused onto a local spot far from the edges of the ﬁlm so

they do not contribute to the spectral response.

Data in Fig. 2 gives evidence for a Faraday rotation set by the ﬁne structure constant.

However, such measurements by themselves are limited, as Eq. 25 shows that the Faraday

rotation still depends non-universally on the index of refraction of the substrate. Our ability to

measure the ﬁne structure constant to high precision is limited by our knowledge of n. However,

by using the explicit time structure of TDTS we can deﬁne and measure a quantity that depends

only on the ﬁne structure constant (and surface ﬁlling factors). When THz light is transmitted

8

through a ﬁlm and substrate, the substrate itself can be used as an optical resonator (22, 29)

resulting in a series of pulses that each have different histories of interaction with the ﬁlm as

shown in Fig. 3(a). The 1st peak that is transmitted through the ﬁlm undergoes a Faraday

rotation, whereas the 2nd peak undergoes an additional reﬂection and Kerr rotation φK. By

subtracting the Faraday rotation, we can measure the Kerr rotation separately. In the quantized

regime, one can show (see SI) that the Kerr rotation (to factors up to second order in α) is

tan(φK) =

4nα

(Nt +

).

(4)

A representative 10 QL sample for the Kerr rotation is shown in Fig. 3(c)(d). Similar to

the Faraday rotation, the signatures of cyclotron resonances are inﬂection points in the real

part and dips in the imaginary part. Above 5.75 T, the Kerr rotation of a 10 QL sample is

quantized as 5 4nα

n2−1 to within our experimental resolution at frequencies below 0.8 THz. The
prefactor of 5 is the same as arrived at in the Faraday rotation. We measured Kerr rotation on

samples with different thickness, 6 QL, 8 QL, 12 QL and 16 QL and in all cases the rotation is

accurately given by 4nα

n2−1 times the ﬁlling factor found in the Faraday rotation experiments as
shown in Fig. 3(e). Eqs. 25 and 27 show that combining Faraday and Kerr rotation in a single

measurement allows one to eliminate the dependence on the index of substrate and to measure

the ﬁne structure constant directly. One ﬁnds that

αmeasured =

1

Nt + Nb + 1/2 + 1/2

tan(φF )2 − tan(φF ) tan(φK)

tan(φK) − 2 tan(φF )

.

(5)

Measuring these quantities in a single scan and taking ratios in this fashion also serves to

minimize the systematic noise in the output for αmeasured. Using Nt + Nb + 1/2 + 1/2 =

5 and 7 for the 10 QL and 12 QL samples respectively, we plot the results of Eq. 29 for
two samples in Fig. 4 and ﬁnd for both the measured value is close to 1/137 (∼ 7.3) mrad.
Averaging over the frequency range that quantized rotation is observed (< 0.8 THz) for all

9

samples measured, we ﬁnd a best measured value for αmeas of 1/137.9, which is close to the

accepted value 1/137.04. This is the ﬁrst direct measurement of the ﬁnite structure constant

based on a topological invariant (and in a purely solid state context). Although the level of

precision we have achieved for α is far less than for instance its determination via the anomalous

magnetic moment of the electron (30), the quantization should be considered quite good. Its

deviation from the accepted value is approximately 0.5%, which can be compared favorably

to the quantization seen in the quantum spin Hall effect which was only quantized to the 10%

level (31). If this measurement could be further reﬁned it could, along with measures of the

Josephson effect and quantized Hall resistances in 2DEGs provide a purely solid state measure

(cid:113)

in a redeﬁned conventional electrical unit scheme for the impedance of free space Z0 =

µ0/0.

Currently, both µ0 and 0 are deﬁned quantities in the International System of Units. With µ0

staying a deﬁned quantity (and essential for the deﬁnition of the Ampere), a measure of α would

allow c to become a measured quantity in a condensed matter experiment.

With advances in high-quality Bi2Se3 ﬁlms and charge-transfer doping by MoO3 to lower
the chemical potential to as low as ∼ 30 meV above the Dirac point coupled to the development
of high-precision time-domain THz polarimetry, we have observed quantized Faraday rotation

and Kerr rotation from topological surface states. The quantized responses we ﬁnd here should

not be viewed as a simple manifestation of the quantized quantum Hall transport seen in usual

2DEGs, since TI surface states live on a closed 2D manifold embedded in 3D space. For

instance, our DC transport does not show a quantized Hall resistance in this ﬁeld range. In a

formalism where the TIs are described as bulk magnetoelectrics, this response can be described

in the context of a topological magnetoelectric effect and axion electrodynamics. Among other

things, this provides a direct solid-state measure of the ﬁne structure constant. The observation

of this effect gives a deﬁnitive characterization of topologically insulating states of matter. It

may prove to be an essential tool in the discovery of theoretically anticipated states of matter

10

such as fractional topological insulators in the form of a fractional magnetoelectric effect (32).

1 Derivation of Modiﬁed Maxwell’s Equations

Qi et al. (7) showed that the electrodynamics of topological insulators can be described by
adding an additional topological term Lθ to the usual Maxwell Lagrangian L0. Here we rederive
the modiﬁed Maxwell’s equations in the conventional 3D vector component notation, which

will be more familiar to many readers of this section as compared to the relativistic Einstein

notation that is typical in the ﬁeld theory literature. The two terms in the Lagrangian density

written down in potential form are

(6)

(7)

Here α is the ﬁne structure constant and 0 and µ0 are the permittivity and permeability of

the free space. The topological contribution θ is an angle 2π(N + 1

2) where N is an integer that
indicates the highest fully ﬁlled Landau level (LL) of the surface when TRS is broken weakly.

It can be formulated as a bulk quantity only modulo a quantum (here 2π) in much the same way

as the electric polarization P in a ferroelectric can only be deﬁned as a bulk quantity modulo a

dipole quantum that depends on the surface charge (8, 12). The action is

(8)
where Sθ derives from the additional term and S0 is the usual Maxwell action. One can start with

S = S0 + Sθ =

dt d3x (L0 + Lθ)

(cid:90)

18

with Eq. 8 and perform the typical variation of the potentials in the action to get modiﬁcations

to Gauss’s law and Amp`ere’s law. The Gauss’s law term comes from variations in the scalar

potential φ. One deﬁnes

δS = S(φ) + S(φ + δφ) = δS0 + δSθ

(9)

where δφ is an inﬁnitesimal. As found in standard references (33) the Maxwell part of the

variation is

(cid:90)

δS0 = −

2 Derivation of Modiﬁed Fresnel and Transmission Equa-

tions

One can use the modiﬁed Amp`ere’s law Eq. 20 with usual Faraday’s law to derive to ﬁnd

modiﬁed boundary conditions for the electric and magnetic ﬁeld and from there reﬂection and

transmission coefﬁcients for a traveling wave. A non-topological surface current J could be

included in this derivation, but we neglect it here because the chemical potential of our samples

are in the gap. One can show for instance that the modiﬁed inverse transmission matrix for

transmission across the vacuum-TI interface is

ˆT −1 =

2(1 + c/v)

(cid:35)

,

2αθ
2π

2(1 + c/v)

(21)

(cid:34) 1

2π

where v is the speed of light inside the TI. For a slab system with broken TRS, the transmission

is most easily computed with circular eigenstates (34). For incoming light polarized polarized

along the x direction, for an isotropic sample the Faraday rotation is given by

tan(φF ) = Txy/Txx =

T++ − T−−
T++ + T−−

1
i

,

(22)

where for instance Txx and Txy are diagonal and off-diagonal terms in the Jones transmission

matrix (not to be confused with the Fresnel transmission coefﬁcient for light across an interface

given by the inverse of Eq. 21) in the xy coordinate frame and T++ and T−− are diagonal terms

in the transmission matrix for the circular basis. (See Ref. (34) for details about the various

bases of Jones matrices and their introconversions). In the limit where the thickness of the ﬁlm

is much less than the wavelength of the incident light, the effect of the two conducting surfaces

21

can be treated as single surface with effective conductance Geﬀ = Gt + Gb. The transmission

then of a thin ﬁlm on a substrate with index of refraction n referenced to a nominally identical

substrate is

Note that this expression neglects a correction coming from the Geﬀ2

current level of precision of the experiment, but may be important formally. If we consider the

correction of α3,

rotation and Kerr rotation as following and deﬁne the topological invariant.

tan(φF )2 − tan(φF ) tan(φK)

(29)

Due to the small size of the rotations, the third term in the denominator makes a negligible

contribution to the ﬁne structure constant we measure and so we have neglected it in the main

text.

3 Experimental methods

Thin ﬁlms of Bi2Se3 were grown at Rutgers University by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on an

insulating Bi2−xInxSe3 buffer layer on top of 0.5 mm thick crystalline Al2O3 substrates. Films
grow a quintuple layer (1 unit cell) at a time (1 QL ∼1 nm). 50 nm MoO3 was deposited in-situ
and was followed by 100 nm amorphous Se to reduce aging effects (35). Details on the growth
can be found elsewhere (17). Films grow a quintuple layer (1 unit cell) at a time (1 QL∼1 nm).
Time-domain THz spectroscopy (TDTS) in a transmission geometry was performed with a

home-built spectrometer. An approximately single-cycle picosecond pulse of light is transmit-

ted through the sample and the substrate. One measures electric ﬁeld in a phase-sensitive TDTS

measurement. The complex transmission is obtained from the ratio of a Fourier transform of

a sample scan over a Fourier transform of a substrate scan. The complex conductance can be

directly inverted from the transmission equation in the thin ﬁlm limit without using Kramers-

Kronig transformation (23):

where ∆L is the small difference in thickness between the sample and reference substrates, n

Complex Faraday and Kerr rotation measurements were performed in a closed-cycle 7 T

superconducting magnet at low temperature. We use the polarization modulation technique to

measure the rotation and ellipticity accurately and the experimental details were discussed in

early works (20, 24).

4 Terahertz data and discussions

The conductance and cyclotron frequencies vs. ﬁeld of a 16 QL Bi2Se3 and a 16 QL Bi2Se3/MoO3

is shown in Fig. 1 in the main text. Here we show the complex Faraday rotation of these two

samples in Fig. 5 in the SI. We can see that the surface treatment of MoO3 with its charge-

transfer mechanism (36) reduces the Faraday rotation by almost a factor of 4. This is consistent

with the depletion of the surface charge carriers. One can also ﬁnd that the cyclotron frequencies

(inﬂection points in the real part and dip positions in the imaginary part) of MoO3-treated sam-

ples are much lower and the features are more pronounced because the in-situ MoO3 capped
sample has a higher mobility (∼ 3500 cm2/V·s ) (17) than a bare Bi2Se3 sample (∼ 1400
cm2/V·s) (35) after an overnight shipping in a vacuum bag.

The zero-ﬁeld complex conductance of 16 QL, 12 QL, 10 QL, 8 QL and 6 QL Bi2Se3/MoO3

samples at 5K is shown in Fig. 6. As done in previous work (24), we used a Drude-term, a

phonon term and a lattice polarizability ∞ term to model the data.

The scattering rate ΓD is half-maximum width of the Drude term peaked at zero frequency. The

ﬁt quality containing one Drude term is showed in Fig. 6(a) (b). The overall ﬁt is excellent

except for the asymmetry near the phonon frequency that is believe to be due to a Fano interac-

tion (37). It is not considered in the Drude-Lorentz analysis here because it does not affect the

low-frequency Faraday and Kerr rotation.

The Drude-Lorentz model does not give carrier density directly.

In order to extract the

information about carrier density and mobility, one need to measure the cyclotron mass. We

consider the conductance in the semi-classical regime by including a cyclotron frequency ωc

term in the circular base and model the complex Faraday rotation.

Details can be found in a previous work (24). We consider one Drude term ﬁrst. By extracting

measure the cyclotron mass m∗, as shown in Fig.6 (e). Using the surface state dispersion up to

meV with ∼5 meV uncertainty for 6 QL, 8 QL, 10 QL, 12 QL and 16 QL respectively.

2π = eB

We also performed ﬁts by treating the top and bottom independently and did a two-Drude

component ﬁt for the Faraday rotation (ﬁt results not shown). We found that in such low-density

samples, the difference of cyclotron masses of top and bottom surfaces is not more than 0.01

27

∼ 0.01 me. Note that in such low-carrier-density samples, the ﬂuctuation of the chemical po-
tential in real space is also important. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) shows that Dirac

point energy distribution in real space has a Gaussian width 20 - 40 meV (38). Considering

the chemical potential ﬂuctuation in a typical topological insulators sample is very close to the

average chemical potential of the samples studied here, treating top and bottom surface approx-

imately the same in the classical regime is a good approximation. At low ﬁelds (below 3.5 T),

the Landau Level (LL) ﬁlling factors may differ a little in real space, the transition between

Landau Levels may overlap with each other, which results in a classical cyclotron resonance in

the spectra. In other words, the cyclotron mass we extracted from the one-Drude component ﬁt

is an average mass of two surface states. However, when the samples reach the quantum regime,

small difference in chemical potential may show up in spectrum such as 6 QL and 8 QL.

Going back to Fig. 6, we discuss the semi-classical regime only. When cyclotron mass (an

average mass) is measured, one can estimate the total sheet carrier density by using ω2

pDd =
and average mobility by using µ = e/ΓDm∗. The extracted carrier density and mobility

n2De2
m∗0
are shown in Fig. 6 (f), the values of which agree with the low-ﬁeld DC transport (17).

In the ﬁrst generation of experiments using THz on the residual bulk-conducting Bi2Se3

samples, a thickness-independent spectral weight was interpreted as an evidence for surface

state transport (22,23), which was further veriﬁed by a topological phase transition experiments

(23) and, more directly, by measuring the cyclotron mass of this channel (24). Note that in
these Bi2Se3 grown on sapphire directly, the total carrier density is ∼ 3 × 1013 /cm2. Even
though chemical potential may differ by ∼ 40 meV for different samples which was observed
in Ref. (24), it only change the chemical potential by ∼ 10 % because the surface state Fermi
energy is ∼ 350 meV. Spectral weight will not show a noticeable change in these high-carrier-
density ﬁlms when the chemical potential changes by 40 meV.

However, in the current generation of low-carrier-density Bi2Se3 samples grown on an in-

28

sulating Bi2−xInxSe3 buffer layer, the total carrier density is ∼ 1 - 3 × 1012 /cm2 (17). Carrier
density changes from sample to sample (17), which will show up as an observable change in the

spectral weight if the chemical potential differs by 40 meV. Also, when the thickness is lower

than 16 QL, the carrier density decreases (17). When these samples were further treated with
MoO3 through a charge transfer process, the carrier density is further lowered to ∼ 2 - 8 × 1011
/cm2 below 10 QL, sample variation and thickness-dependent carrier density are expected in

such a low-density regime. For instance, we also measured another 16 QL Bi2Se3/MoO3 and

found that Faraday rotation quantized at Nt + Nb = 5 (data not show). We have also found that

MoO3 is not effective in depleting carrier in thicker ﬁlms (for example 32 QL). This indicates

that MoO3 is less effective in depleting the carrier on the bottom surface in thicker samples. In

thinner samples, either because the top and bottom surfaces are connected by side surface states

or through a tunneling process, MoO3 is very effective in reducing the total carrier density.

We believe a thickness-dependent spectral weight (or carrier density) is not surprising in these

samples with ultra-low carrier densities.
