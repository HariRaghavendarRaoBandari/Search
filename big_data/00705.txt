We studied narrow 1H NMR spectra of Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2 powders at 100−355 K and 42−59
MHz using pulsed NMR techniques. The Fourier transformed NMR spectra of the proton free-
induction signals show the superposition of broad and narrow components, which can be assigned
to immobile protons and extrinsic mobile protons, respectively. We found that a narrow spectrum
develops on heating above about Tc = 260 K and widens above a Larmor frequency of about νc =
50 MHz for Mg(OH)2. The temperature-induced NMR spectrum and the characteristic frequency
νc of 50 MHz are the noteworthy features of the nuclear spin ﬂuctuation spectra of the extrinsic
protons.

INTRODUCTION

The conventional motional narrowing eﬀects on NMR
spectra are the rapid decrease in NMR linewidths on
heating above speciﬁc temperatures due to molecular mo-
tion and atomic diﬀusion [1]. Ionic conduction facilitated
by lattice defects also causes the narrowing of the NMR
spectra [2]. The development of a narrow NMR spec-
trum superposed with a broad NMR spectrum has been
observed for some hydrates [3–6], hydrogen-bonded com-
pounds [7, 8], and nanocrystalline Li compounds [9–11].
The broad component is assigned to immobile ions with
dipole-dipole couplings on a rigid lattice, while the nar-
row component is assigned to mobile ions decoupled from
the matrix of each material. Recent pulsed NMR studies
of Mg(OH)2 powder also showed the coexistence of nar-
row and broad 1H NMR spectra in a wide temperature
range [12].

Single-crystal 1H NMR studies of Mg(OH)2 at room
temperature showed wide NMR spectra and angular
dependences with respect to the crystal axes [13, 14],
while powder NMR studies showed narrow NMR spec-
tra [15, 16]. Both single-crystal and powder 1H NMR
studies of Ca(OH)2 showed wide NMR spectra [17]. We
revealed the superposition of broad and narrow NMR
spectra for Mg(OH)2, which were assigned to dipole-
coupled protons on a rigid lattice and to extrinsic pro-
tons, respectively [12].

The crystal structure of the divalent hydroxides
M(OH)2 (M = Mg, Ca) is characterized by a layered
structure and OH groups (trigonal, P 3m1). Figure 1
shows a unit cell of the crystal lattice. The lattice spac-
ing and unit cell volume of Ca(OH)2 are larger than those
of Mg(OH)2 [18]. According to neutron diﬀraction stud-
ies [18, 19], the hydrogen site symmetry with a threefold
axis is broken and the space group of the crystal structure
is P 3. The location of the hydrogen atoms is assigned to
the XGT sites with 1/3 occupation in Fig. 1.

Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2 are proton conductors above
room temperature [20]. The thermal activation energy of

proton transport was estimated to be 2.0 eV for Mg(OH)2
and 2.2 eV for Ca(OH)2 [20]. Excess protons and pro-
ton vacancies are considered to be mobile carriers in the
conductivity. The extrinsic protons associated with the
narrow NMR spectrum may be mobile protons facilitated
by lattice defects.

In this paper, we studied the narrow component of the
proton NMR spectrum for commercially available pow-
der samples of Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2 by pulsed Fourier
transformed (FT) 1H NMR techniques with variable tem-
perature and Larmor frequency νL. We found unconven-
tional strong temperature and frequency dependences of
the narrow component. The proton spin ﬂuctuation spec-
trum with a characteristic temperature Tc of 260 K and
a characteristic frequency νc of 50 MHz is diﬀerent from
that obtained from a conventional Lorentzian model. To
our knowledge, our discovery of the characteristic fre-
quency νc of 50 MHz is unprecedented.

rity, Sigma-Aldrich). The samples were annealed at 120
◦C for 18 h in air and were conﬁrmed to have a sin-
gle phase from their powder X-ray diﬀraction patterns.
The samples were treated in a glove box with N2 gas (a
dry atmosphere) and were sealed in glass tubes with N2
gas for NMR experiments. A phase-coherent-type pulsed
spectrometer was used for the 1H proton NMR (nuclear
spin I = 1/2) experiments from a Larmor frequency νL
of 42.5772 MHz in an external magnetic ﬁeld of 1.0 T
to 59.6 MHz in a magnetic ﬁeld of 1.4 T. The NMR
frequency spectra were obtained from Fourier transfor-
mation of the proton free-induction decay (FID) sig-
nals. The proton nuclear spin-lattice relaxation curves
p(t) ≡ 1 − F (t)/F (∞) [recovery curves of the integrated
FID signal F (t)] were measured by using an inversion
recovery technique as a function of time t (> 5 ms) fol-
lowing an inversion pulse. The equilibrium proton mag-
netization F (∞) is the integrated FID signal without an
inversion pulse.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND

DISCUSSION

A. Development of narrow FT NMR spectra

Figure 2 shows temperature dependences of the narrow
NMR spectra at νL = 42.5772 MHz for Mg(OH)2 and
Ca(OH)2. Note that the spectra are displaced along the
horizontal axis for clarity and that the frequency scale of
the upper panel is diﬀerent from that of the lower panel.
The intensity of either narrow component increases with
increasing temperature in a manner not satisfying Curie’s
law.

Figure 3 shows temperature dependences of the prod-
uct of the integrated intensity and temperature (upper
panel) and the full width at half maximum (FWHM)
(lower panel) of the narrow component for Mg(OH)2.
The intensity is normalized by the total intensity of the
broad and narrow components at 355 K. The narrow
component develops above about Tc = 260 K, which is
deﬁned as the inﬂection point at which the solid curve
changes from being concave downward to concave up-
ward, in a manner not satisfying Curie’s law. The tem-
perature dependence of the narrow NMR spectrum was
reversible in the temperature range of 100−355 K. No
hysteresis with temperature was observed within the ex-
perimental accuracy. The intensity of the narrow compo-
nent was ﬁt to a thermal-activation-type function I(T ) =
I0exp(−∆/kBT ) (I0 and ∆ are ﬁtting parameters) with
∆ = 0.082 eV, indicated by the dashed curve. The in-
ﬂection point of Tc = 260 K is inconsistent with that of

I(T ) with ∆ = 0.082 eV. The activation function may
not be the best ﬁtting function.

Since Mg(OH)2 is a proton conductor above room tem-
perature [20], the narrow component may be assigned to
mobile protons facilitated by lattice defects and activated
by thermal energy. The activation energy of ∆ = 0.082
eV in the narrow NMR spectrum in Fig. 3 is about 24
times smaller than the activation energy of 2.0 eV for
the proton conductivity [20] and about ﬁve times smaller
than the excitation energy of 0.4 eV for a proton jump
in a local Morse potential [21]. The discrepancy between
the estimated values suggests that the mechanism of the
proton conduction below 355 K detected by the NMR is
diﬀerent from that of the proton transport above room
temperature. Quantum tunneling of protons is a possible
candidate for the proton conduction below room temper-
ature.

Figure 3 (lower panel) shows the temperature depen-
dence of the FWHM of the narrow NMR spectrum for
Mg(OH)2. Above Tc, the FWHM is about 3.3 kHz at 300
K. Below Tc, the FWHM is about 5.5 kHz at 100 K. Be-
low Tc, the intensity is small but ﬁnite, and the FWHM
is broadened but still be narrow. Thus, Tc characterizes
not a phase transition but a crossover phenomenon.

of the integrated intensity and temperature (upper panel) and
the FWHM (lower panel) of the narrow component at νL =
42.5772 MHz. The intensity is normalized by the total in-
tensity of the broad and narrow components at 355 K. The
narrow component develops above Tc = 260 K and is ﬁnite
below Tc. The solid curve is a visual guide. The dashed curve
indicates the result from least-squares ﬁtting using a thermal-
activation-type function I0exp(−∆/kBT ) with ∆ = 0.082 eV.

2. Ca(OH)2

Figure 4 shows temperature dependences of the prod-
uct of the integrated intensity and temperature (upper
panel) and the FWHM (lower panel) of the narrow com-
ponent for Ca(OH)2. The temperature dependences of
the intensity and the FWHM for Ca(OH)2 are nearly
the same as those for Mg(OH)2. The ratio of the nar-
row component to the broad component in Ca(OH)2 is
less than that in Mg(OH)2 at 355 K. Thus, the number
of proton defects in Ca(OH)2 may be less than that in
Mg(OH)2. The diﬀerence in the defect density may be
related to that in the proton conductivity.

component

1. Mg(OH)2

For Mg(OH)2, the recovery curves of the long tail of
the FID signal F (t) (the integrated intensity after 60 µs
following an excitation pulse) were recorded as a function
of the time t following the inversion pulse in order to se-
lectively observe the narrow NMR component. Although

the FWHM (lower panel) of the narrow component at νL =
42.5772 MHz. The intensity of the narrow component is less
than 1% of the total intensity.

the theoretical recovery curve for 1H NMR should be a
single-exponential function in a uniform system, all the
recovery curves were of a nonexponential type, which is
consistent with a previous report [15]. We analyzed the
recovery curves using a stretched exponential function
with a variable exponent β,

p(t) = p(0)exph−(cid:16) t

τ1(cid:17)βi,

(1)

where p(0), τ1, and β are ﬁtting parameters.

Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of the pro-
ton spin-lattice relaxation curve of the narrow compo-
nent. The sold curves are the least-squares ﬁtting results
using Eq. (1).

Figure 6 shows the temperature dependences of the
variable exponent β (a) and 1/τ1 (b). A value of β < 1
indicates an inhomogeneous relaxation process in space in
the temperature range of 200−355 K. Part of the protons
quickly relax in t/τ1 < 1.

The proton spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/τ1 monoton-
ically decreases on cooling. Above about 260 K, the
stretched exponential relaxation rate 1/τ1 of the narrow
component is larger than the single-exponential relax-
ation rate 1/T1 of the broad component [12]. The tem-
perature dependence of 1/τ1 is diﬀerent from that ex-
pected from the slowing-down eﬀects on the spin-spin
correlation time τc in the Bloembergen−Purcell−Pound
(BPP) model [22]. The frequency dependence of the ﬂuc-
tuation spectrum in the BPP model is of a Lorentzian
type. The relaxation rate due to the BPP ﬂuctuations

2. Ca(OH)2

For Ca(OH)2, all the recovery curves were of a non-
exponential type, which is consistent with a previous re-
port [23]. The iterative ﬁtting using Eq. (1) led to a small
exponent β < 0.5 and the convergence was poor. Thus,
the stretched exponential function given by Eq. (1) could
not accurately reproduce the recovery curves, as shown
by the dashed curve in Fig. 7. We obtained better ﬁtting
results by using a double-exponential function,

son, the temperature dependences of the stretched exponent
β (a) and the proton spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 (b) of
the broad component are also shown.

Both 1/T1L and 1/T1S for the narrow component show
weak dependence on the temperature and are larger than
the relaxation rate 1/T1 of the broad component. No
slowing-down eﬀect was found in any of the nuclear spin-
lattice relaxation components.

The large diﬀerence in the proton spin-lattice relax-
ation between the narrow and broad components is a
characteristic of Ca(OH)2. The proton ﬂuctuation spec-
trum of the narrow component for Ca(OH)2 may have a
diﬀerent nature from that for Mg(OH)2.

C. NMR spectra with variable Larmor frequency

for Mg(OH)2

Figure 9 shows the Larmor frequency dependences of
the narrow component (upper panel) and the FWHM
(lower panel) for Mg(OH)2 over the frequency range of
42.5772−59.6 MHz at 300 K. The linewidth of the nar-
row component rapidly increases above about νc = 50
MHz, which we identify as the characteristic frequency
of the ﬂuctuation spectrum of the extrinsic protons. The
frequency dependence was reversible and exhibited no
hysteresis within the experimental accuracy. The tem-
perature of about 300 K is suﬃciently high for the mag-
netic ﬁeld eﬀect on the nuclear magnetism to be negligi-
bly small. Figure 9 shows the pure frequency dependence
of the NMR spectrum rather than the magnetic ﬁeld ef-
fect. Measurement at a higher Larmor frequency pro-

snapshot taken above νc = 50 MHz indicates a widening
narrow spectrum while the narrowing eﬀect is still active.
The temperature dependences of the intensity of the nar-
row and broad components at 59.6 MHz were similar to
those at 42.5772 MHz in Fig. 9.

D. Temperature-induced 1H NMR signals

The temperature-induced 1H NMR spectra and the
two-component spectra have been observed for MgH2 [3],
LiBH4 [4], NaMgH3 [5], NaH [6], and the KH2PO4 fam-
ily [7, 8].

A pulsed proton NMR study of ball-milled magnesium
hydrate (MgH2) with Nb2O5 additive produced narrow
and broad NMR spectra above room temperature [3].
MgH2 is a promising hydrogen storage material. The
narrow component was assigned to mobile protons [3].
Subsequent studies by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) support the assignment of the NMR spectra. The
TEM imaging suggested that the protons diﬀuse at the
interface between MgH2 and Nb2O5 grains [24].

For Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2, part of the protons may
depart from the XGT sites and may be itinerant among
the defect sites and/or the intersites above Tc. The

number of itinerant protons may increase with increas-
ing temperature above Tc. The increase in the intensity
of the narrow NMR spectrum is similar to that in the
number of itinerant protons. The extrinsic protons may
be such itinerant protons. Irreversible surface degrada-
tion of the powder grains is excluded because the two-
component NMR spectra were reversible in the heat cy-
cle.

The characteristic frequency νc of 50 MHz has not been
reported so far for the proton conductors. The Larmor
frequency dependence in Fig. 9 may be a key to under-
standing the temperature-induced 1H NMR signals and
the spin ﬂuctuation spectrum of the extrinsic protons.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

6

We observed the temperature-induced narrow compo-
nent of the proton NMR spectrum for Mg(OH)2 and
Ca(OH)2 powders. Above the characteristic tempera-
ture Tc of 260 K, the NMR line develops while narrow-
ing. Above the characteristic frequency νc of 50 MHz,
the NMR line decreases while broadening. No slowing-
down eﬀect was observed in any of the components of the
proton spin-lattice relaxation. The ﬂuctuation spectrum
of the extrinsic protons is diﬀerent from that obtained
from the conventional BPP model.
