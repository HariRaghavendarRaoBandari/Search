RR Lyrae stars are classical pulsating stars. They pulsate mostly in the radial
fundamental mode (RRab stars), in the radial ﬁrst overtone mode (RRc stars),
or in both modes simultaneously (RRd stars). Collection of variable stars from
the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) contains more than 38 000
RR Lyrae stars from the Galactic bulge. We analysed these data for RRc and RRd
stars. We have found new members of radial–non-radial double-mode RR Lyrae
stars, with characteristic period ratio of the two modes around 0.61. We increased
the number of known RR Lyrae stars of this type by a factor of 8.

We have also discovered another group of double-mode RR Lyrae stars. They
pulsate in the ﬁrst overtone and in another, unidentiﬁed mode, which has period
longer than period of the undetected fundamental mode. The period ratios tightly
cluster around 0.686. These proceedings are focused on this puzzling group. In
particular, we report eight new members of the group.

1 Introduction

RR Lyrae stars pulsate mostly in the radial fundamental mode or in the radial ﬁrst
overtone mode. Double-mode radial pulsators are also known. They pulsate simul-
taneously either in the fundamental mode and in the ﬁrst overtone (green asterisks
in Fig. 1), or in the fundamental mode and in the second overtone (red triangles in
Fig. 1). Observations revealed another group of double-mode RR Lyrae stars. These
stars pulsate in the ﬁrst overtone (RRc or RRd) and have another signal of higher
frequency (shorter period). Period ratio of the additional mode to the ﬁrst over-
tone is around 0.61. The additional variability cannot correspond to any radial mode
(Moskalik et al., 2015). Until recently, this group was not numerous: 23 stars were
discovered in various stellar systems both in the ground and in the space observa-
tions (for a summary see Moskalik et al., 2015). Additional 18 stars of this type were
discovered in M3 by Jurcsik et al. (2015).

We have analysed photometry for RRc stars from the Galactic bulge collected by
the OGLE project (Udalski et al., 2015). We have signiﬁcantly increased the number
of double-mode stars with Px/P1O ≈ 0.61 (Netzel et al., 2015b,c). Thanks to our
analysis, three separate sequences formed by these stars in the Petersen diagram were
revealed (blue asterisks in Fig. 1). Explanation for this puzzling group of double-
periodic pulsators was proposed recently by Dziembowski (2015).

These proceedings are focused on another exciting discovery we have made in the
OGLE data (Netzel et al., 2015a). We have detected additional, unexpected signals

in a group of RRc stars (magenta crosses in Fig. 1). Additional signal has frequency
lower than the frequency of the ﬁrst overtone; even lower than the frequency of the
fundamental mode, which is undetected in these stars. Explanation of the nature
of these signals faces diﬃculties. For short discussion see Netzel et al. (2015a) and
Dziembowski (2015).

2 Data analysis

Our analysis of RR Lyrae stars was focused on a search of additional low-amplitude
signals. In the OGLE collection of variable stars there are more than 10 000 RRc stars
(Soszy´nski et al., 2014). First, we decided to focus on stars which were most frequently
observed. These stars are located in the OGLE ﬁelds 501 and 505 (see position
of observational ﬁelds in ﬁg. 15 in Udalski et al., 2015). Selected stars have more
than 8 000 data points from four observational seasons of OGLE-IV. There are 485
RRc stars in the sample. They were analysed manually, using standard consecutive
prewhitening technique, with the dedicated software written by the authors. For
some stars, after prewhitening with the ﬁrst overtone and its harmonics, residual
signal at the frequency of the ﬁrst overtone remained. It may correspond to long-term
period changes in these stars or to long-term amplitude and/or phase modulation (the
Blazhko eﬀect). For these stars, to increase the frequency resolution, we combined
OGLE-IV data with data available from the previous phases of the OGLE project
(Soszy´nski et al., 2011). Increased data length allowed us to resolve close frequencies
and to detect long-period modulation in a few stars.

Analysis of the whole sample of more than 10 000 RRc stars in the Galactic bulge

is ongoing. Some of preliminary results are reported in these proceedings.

3 New group of double-mode stars

During the analysis of the selected sample of 485 RRc stars, we detected an additional
signal in 11 stars (2 per cent of the analysed sample). Frequency of the additional
signal is lower than the frequency of the fundamental mode, which is not detected in

these stars. In the Petersen diagram in Fig. 1, stars of the new group are marked
with magenta crosses. They form a horizontal sequence and tightly cluster around
0.686. Typical amplitude of the additional signal corresponds to few per cent of the
ﬁrst overtone amplitude (and does not exceed 10 per cent).

A literature search revealed one additional RRc star of this type, KIC945311,
which was observed with Kepler space telescope and analysed by Moskalik et al.
(2015). In this star additional 0.61 mode was discovered. For one of the additional
low-amplitude periodicities (designated as f5 in tab. 7 in Moskalik et al., 2015)
we have found P1O/P5 = 0.6867. Thus, this star ﬁts the progression in the Petersen
diagram very well and is also a member of the new group. These results were described
in detail in Netzel et al. (2015a).

Preliminary analysis of the full sample of 10 826 OGLE RRc stars stars revealed
eight new stars that belong to this group. They are reported here for the ﬁrst time.
Altogether there are 19 members of the new group discovered in the OGLE data and
one star discovered in the Kepler data. Basic properties of all stars are collected
in Tab. 1. First part of the table contains stars described in Netzel et al. (2015a),
including one star observed with Kepler telescope. Second part of the table contains
data on 8 newly discovered stars. We note that in all these stars we detect signals at
combination frequency with the ﬁrst overtone, which proves that additional signal is
intrinsic to these stars and is not due to contamination.

In Fig. 2, we show the Petersen diagram with all known stars of the discussed

type. No speciﬁc structures are present within this group.

Fig. 2: Petersen diagram for RRc stars with additional, long-period signal. New detections
reported in these proceedings are marked with ﬁlled triangles. Stars discovered earlier in the
OGLE data are marked with asterisks and single star observed with Kepler is marked with
ﬁlled circle.

A glimpse at the Petersen diagram (Fig. 1) shows that the additional signal cannot
correspond to any radial mode. The corresponding period is longer than the funda-
mental mode period. Moreover, it cannot correspond to stellar rotation or presence
of a companion (it is too short). It seems that the most likely explanation is exci-
tation of non-radial mode of gravity or of mixed character. This explanation faces
many diﬃculties, however (for a short discussion see section 5 in Netzel et al., 2015a).

Recently, Dziembowski (2015) noted that additional periodicity could be attributed
to radial fundamental mode if these objects are low-mass striped giants rather than
genuine RRc stars. This explanation has its own problems as well, as discussed by
Dziembowski (2015). We have checked whether these stars are correctly identiﬁed as
RRc pulsators. We investigated light curve shapes visually and quantitatively using
the Fourier decomposition parameters (see ﬁg. 3 and 4 in Netzel et al., 2015a). They
are typical for RRc stars. For a few stars we detect higher scatter of the phased light
curve (see ﬁg. 3 in Netzel et al., 2015a). This is either due to lower mean brightness
of these stars or due to period change which is common among RRc stars. Based on
these considerations, identiﬁcation of these stars as RR Lyrae variables seems correct.

Two stars are interesting on their own and are discussed in more detail below.
In the frequency spectrum of OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-07653, after prewhitening with
the ﬁrst overtone and its harmonics, we detected residual unresolved signal at the
position of f1O. We joined all available data for this star. Merged data are plotted in
Fig. 3. Increased length of the data set allowed us to detect triplet structure in the
frequency spectrum. The side peaks at f1O are presented in Fig. 4. We interpret this
structure as a signature of the Blazhko eﬀect (long-period amplitude and/or phase
modulation). Period of the Blazhko modulation is 1698 ± 4 d.

In the frequency spectrum for OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-30601, we found more than
one additional frequency. Additional long-period signal, fX, with P1O/PX ≈ 0.687,
is clearly detected, together with the combination frequency with the ﬁrst overtone.
There is another signal in the frequency spectrum at fY ≈ 2.712544 d−1. Period ra-
tio, P1O/PY ≈ 0.7695, is too high to ﬁt the RRd sequence in the Petersen diagram.
Combination frequency, fY + f1O, is also detected, which rules out the possible con-
tamination. Signal at fY has higher amplitude than signal at fX. There are two other
signiﬁcant signals close to f1O. Together with ﬁrst overtone frequency they form un-
evenly spaced triplet. Separation between the low-frequency side peak and the ﬁrst
overtone is 0.07534 d−1, which corresponds to modulation period of 13.27 d. For the
high-frequency side peak the separation is 0.07173 d−1 (modulation period of 13.94 d).
This structure is not detected at harmonics of the ﬁrst overtone. Light curve of this
star, its Fourier decomposition parameters, are typical for RRc star.

4 Summary

We have analysed ﬁrst overtone RR Lyrae stars located in the Galactic bulge from the
OGLE collection of variable stars. We focused on a search for additional periodicities
in these stars. We have signiﬁcantly increased the number of double-mode stars with
PX/P1O ≈ 0.61. More than 260 stars were detected in the OGLE data (Netzel et al.,
2015b,c). We have also discovered entirely new group of double-periodic stars, with
dominant variation associated with the radial ﬁrst overtone and additional periodicity
of longer period (Netzel et al., 2015a). In the Petersen diagram, these stars form a
horizontal sequence, with period ratios, P1O/PX, clustering around 0.686. So far we
know 20 stars of this type. These stars still lack a satisfactory explanation.
