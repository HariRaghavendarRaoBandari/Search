(Dated: March 31, 2016)

Motivated by recently discovered quasi-one-dimensional superconductor K2Cr3As3 with D3h lat-
tice symmetry, we study one-dimensional three-orbital Hubbard model with generic electron re-
pulsive interaction described by intra-orbital repulsion U , inter-orbital repulsion U′, and Hund’s
coupling J. As extracted from density functional theory calculation, two of the three atomic or-
bitals are degenerate (E′ states) and the third one is non-degenerate (A′1), and the system is at
incommensurate ﬁlling. With the help of bosonization, the normal state is described by a three-
band Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. Possible charge density wave (CDW), spin density wave (SDW)
and superconducting (SC) instabilities are analyzed by renormalization group method. The ground
state depends on the ratio J/U and is sensitive to the degeneracy of E′ bands. Spin-singlet SC
state is favored at 0 < J < U/3, and spin-triplet SC state is favored in the region U/3 < J < U/2.
The SDW state has the lowest energy only in the unphysical parameter region J > U/2. When the
two-fold degeneracy of E′ bands is lifted, SDW instability has the tendency to dominate over the
spin-singlet SC state at 0 < J < U/3, while the order parameter of the spin-triplet SC state will be
modulated by a phase factor 2∆kF x at U/3 < J < U/2. Possible experimental consequences and
applications to K2Cr3As3 are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

There has been considerable interest on the recent dis-
covery of a new family of quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-
1D) unconventional superconductors A2Cr3As3(A = K,
Rb, Cs) in ambient pressure with Tc up to 6.1 K1–3, be-
cause of their exotic properties revealed in various ex-
periments below. (1) In the normal state, the resistiv-
ity in polycrystalline samples follows a linear temper-
ature dependence, ρ(T ) = ρ0 + AT ,
in a wide tem-
perature region, diﬀerent from the usual Fermi liquid
behavior ρ0 + AT 21–3. On the other hand, the trans-
port measurement in single crystalline samples indicates
that the normal state is a smectic metal, namely, it be-
haves as a metal along the c-axis and a semiconduc-
tor in the ab-plane4.
(2) Nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) and nuclear quadrapole resonance (NQR) mea-
surements on K2Cr3As3 show a non-integer power-law
temperature dependence 1/T1 ∼ T 0.75 above Tc, which
liquid nor Curie-
is neither 1/T1 ∼ T for a Fermi
Weiss behavior 1/T1T ∼ C/(T + θ) for a ferromagnet
or antiferromagnet5. Meanwhile, NMR and NQR ex-
periments on Rb2Cr3As3 show a critical spin ﬂuctua-
tion above Tc, 1/T1T ∼ a + b/(T + θ), where θ ∼ 0K6.
The Hebel-Slichter coherence peak of 1/T1 is absent in
both compounds. (3) K2Cr3As3 possesses a large upper
critical ﬁeld Hc2, which exceeds the BCS weak-coupling
Pauli limit ﬁeld by 3-4 times1,7,8. The angle resolved
Hc2 measurement demonstrates strong anisotropy and
reveals dominant spin-triplet SC pairing9, which is con-
sistent with the observation of a very weak spontaneous
internal magnetic ﬁeld near Tc in the muon spin relax-
ation/rotation (µSR) experiment10.
(4) London pene-

tration depth measurement for K2Cr3As3 shows linear
temperature dependence, ∆λ(T ) ∼ T , at temperatures
T ≪ Tc, indicating the existence of line nodes in the SC
gap11. (5) Doping nonmagnetic impurities in K2Cr3As3
will reduce Tc signiﬁcantly, which indicates non-s-wave
superconductivity12.

There have also been a series of theoretical studies.
(1) The electronic structure of K2Cr3As3 has been inves-
tigated by Jiang et al.13 using density functional theory
(DFT), which is conﬁrmed by later calculation14. The
band calculations show that Cr-3d orbitals dominate the
electronic states near the Fermi level, and there exist
three energy bands at the Fermi level: two quasi-1D α-
and β-bands with ﬂat Fermi surfaces, and a 3D γ-band.
(2) Zhou et al. et al. proposed a minimum eﬀective
model based on three molecular orbitals on a hexago-
nal lattice with D3h symmetry15. They found that for
small Hubbard U and moderate Hund’s coupling J, the
pairing arises from the 3D γ band and has a spatial sym-
metry fy(3x2−y2), which gives line nodes in the gap func-
tion, while for large U , a fully gapped p-wave state, pz ˆz
dominates at the quasi-1D α-band. The spin-triplet SC
pairing is driven by the Hund’s coupling. Similar three-
band and six-band models were also proposed by Wu et
al.16–18. The dominant SC instability channels are found
as pz and fy(3x2−y2) for weak and strong Hund’s coupling
respectively. (3) Zhong et al. carried out DFT calcu-
lation on a single [CrAs]∞ tube to construct an eﬀec-
tive three-band Hubbard model19. Possible Tomonaga-
Luttinger liquid instabilities have been proposed based
on such a three-band Hubbard chain.

Beside its possible exotic superconductivity, K2Cr3As3
provides a platform for us to study 1D correlated elec-

trons apart from carbon nanotubes and cuprate lad-
ders.
The key building block of K2Cr3As3 is the
1D [(Cr3As3)2−]∞ double-walled subnanotubes, which
are separated by columns of K+ ions,
in contrast
to the layered iron-pnictide and copper-oxide high
Tc superconductors1. These [(Cr3As3)2−]∞ tubes to-
gether with K+ ions form a noncentrosymmetric hexag-
lattice with D3h point group1. The quasi-one-
onal
dimensionality can be also seen from its electronic
structure, say, the existence of two quasi-1D electron
bands13,14. Experimentally, both the smectic metallic
transport4 and the non-integer power-law temperature
dependence in NMR 1/T1 ∼ T 0.755 imply a Tomonaga-
Luttinger liquid (TLL) normal state. The question is
how this three-band TLL normal state gives rise to the
unconventional SC states below Tc. This motivates us
to study possible instabilities of three-band TLLs in this
paper. Our analysis on the TLLs in this class of ma-
terials may also help us understand their normal state
properties.

This paper is organized as follows. We present the elec-
tronic model Hamiltonian in Section II. In Section III, the
low-energy scattering processes near the Fermi points are
classiﬁed by using generalized g-ology. In Section IV, we
take the continuum limit and use bosonization technique
to transform the fermionic Hamiltonian into bosonic
Hamiltonian. The non-interacting part describes a three-
band TLL, and the remaining terms describe the bosonic
interactions. In Section V, order parameters are deﬁned
to characterize ordered states. In Section VI, we utilize
renormalization group (RG) to analyze these bosonic in-
teractions. The RG equations are derived by operator
product expansion (OPE) method. The relevant terms
lead to diﬀerent instabilities in diﬀerent parameters re-
gions. Section VII is devoted to discussions and conclu-
sions.

II. MODEL HAMILTONIAN

We consider a single fermionic chain with a unit cell
(per Cr6As6 cluster) containing three molecular orbitals.
One of the three orbitals belongs to one-dimensional ir-
reducible representation A′ of D3h group, and the other
two are in the two-dimensional irreducible representation
E′15. Without loss of generality, the fermionic Hamilto-
nian consists of two parts,

H F = H F

0 + H F

where the non-interacting part H F
is a three-band

int originates from the

The D3h lattice symmetry does not allow the mixture
between A′1 state and E′ states along the c-direction.
The absence of such hybridization is also seen from the
DFT calculation, where the β and γ bands are degenerate
along the Γ− A line. Neglecting the inter-chain coupling,
we have the following H F

0 in such a 1D system,

H F

(1b)

where σ =↑,↓ is the spin index, and the orbital (or band)
index m = 0 refers to the A′1 state and m = ±1 refer to
E′ states. ckmσ(c†kmσ) is electron annihilation (creation)
operator for orbital m and spin σ. The energy disper-
sion ξkm can be linearized near the Fermi energy, as is
sketched in Fig. 1.

of Pauli matrices, and ¯σ = −σ is the opposite spin to
σ. U is the intra-orbital repulsion, U′ is the inter-orbital
repulsion, J is the Hund’s coupling, and J′ is the pair-
hopping. Note that we have chosen Wannier functions
to be real. The two degenerate orbitals m = ±1 transfer
as x and y under D3h symmetry operations, respectively.
We also assume that

J′ = J > 0,

(2)

so that the following relation

U = U′ + 2J

(3)

arises subject to the rotational symmetry of the Coulomb
interaction.

III. CONTINUUM LIMIT AND THE g-OLOGY

Now we introduce electron ﬁelds cmσ(x) to study the
low energy physics in the continuum limit, hereafter x
denotes the coordinate along the chain (c-direction). In
a 1D system, Fermi points fall into two categories char-
acterized by chirality p = R, L, which represents right
and left-moving electrons, respectively. Thus the elec-
tron ﬁeld cmσ(x) can be decomposed into two parts

cmσ(x) = ψRmσ(x) + ψLmσ(x)

(4)

in low energies.

In order to classify various scattering processes in such
a three-band system, we shall generalize the conventional
g-ology21,23 for single-band spinless fermions, which now
includes chirality, band and spin indices. For single-
band spinless fermions, there are four possible scattering
processes between the two chiralities because of lattice
momentum conservation. All these scattering processes
are illustrated in Fig. 2, back scattering g(1)ψ†pψ†¯pψpψ ¯p,
double-chirality forward scattering g(2)ψ†pψ†¯pψ ¯pψp, umk-
lapp scattering g(3)ψ†pψ†pψ ¯pψ ¯p and single-chirality for-
ward scattering g(4)ψ†pψ†pψpψp, where ¯p is the opposite
chirality to p.

and spin degrees of freedom, which is summarized in Ta-
ble I. One of the subscripts is for spin degrees of freedom,
namely, “k” denotes spin parallel scattering and “⊥” de-
notes spin anti-parallel scattering. The other subscript
is associated with the notations g and f . Now the nota-
tion g is used only for the scattering processes within the
same D3h irreducible representation, which includes the
scattering between two E′ bands with m = ±1 and the
scattering within the A′1 band with m = 0. It is similar
to g1,2,3,4 for two chiralities that we use g1ψ†mψ†¯mψmψ ¯m,
g2ψ†mψ†¯mψ ¯mψm, g3ψ†mψ†mψ ¯mψ ¯m, and g4ψ†mψ†mψmψm for
the scatterings between two E′ bands, where ¯m is the
opposite orbital to m. We also use gψ†0ψ†0ψ0ψ0 for the
scattering within the A′1 band by neglecting the sub-
script. On the other hand, the new notation f de-
scribes the scattering between E′ and A′1 bands, includ-
ing f1(ψ†mψ†0ψmψ0 + h.c.), f2(ψ†mψ†0ψ0ψm + h.c.), and
f3(ψ†mψ†mψ0ψ0 + h.c.), where m = ±1. Four typical scat-
tering processes are plotted in Fig. 3, which are all the
dominant scattering processes at incommensurate ﬁlling
as we will discuss later.

The long wavelength physics is dominated by low en-
ergy scattering processes near the Fermi points. These
g-ology classiﬁed scattering processes serve as building
blocks for the low energy eﬀective theory. We can decou-
ple the microscopic Hamiltonian in terms of these pro-
cesses to obtain the eﬀective theory.

For instance, the inter-band Hubbard repulsive inter-
action U′ between the two degenerate E′ bands m = ±1
can be decoupled as follows,
c†imσcimσc†i ¯mσ′ ci ¯mσ′

The initial values of the coupling constants (f ’s and
g’s) in the eﬀective theory are determined by the micro-
scopic Hamiltonian H F . Decoupling all the terms in H F
int
in Eq. (1c) and collecting all the scattering processes, we
obtain the values of nonzero coupling constants,

For the three-band spinful fermions, we introduce an

where the relations Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) have been used in
deriving the above equations. Finally, we shall take the
continuum limit by using Eq. (4) to obtain the fermion
ﬁeld theory.

IV. BOSONIZATION

To study low energy eﬀective theory, we shall uti-
lize the standard bosonization technique to analyze the
continuum fermion model. In abelian bosonization, the
fermion operators can be expressed in terms of boson
operators as follows23,

ψpmσ =

ηmσ√2πa

eipkF mxe−ipϕpmσ ,

(7a)

where kF m is the Fermi momentum for band m, a is the
cutoﬀ which can be chosen as the lattice constant, and
p = 1(−1) stands for R(L) branch. The Klein factors
ηmσ ensure the fermionic statistics and obey the anti-
commutation relations

Counting the four-fermion interactions, there are still
some gauge degrees of freedom for choosing the values
of product of two Klein factors with diﬀerent band in-
dices m. In this paper, we adopt the convention

ηmση ¯mσ = η0σηmσ = imσ,
ηmσηm¯σ = η0ση0¯σ = iσ,
ηmση ¯m¯σ = η0σηm¯σ = im,

(7c)
(7d)
(7e)

where m = ±1 and σ = +1 (−1) for spin up(down). As
we will see later in this section, these products of two
Klein factors will determine the sign of coupling con-
stants in the bosonic interacting Hamiltonian.

The chiral ﬁelds ϕpmσ can be written in terms of two

non-chiral ﬁelds φmσ and θmσ through

{ηmσ, ηm′σ′} = 2δmm′δσσ′ .

(7b)

ϕpmσ = φmσ − pθmσ.

(7f)

Their gradients are proportional to fermionic density and
current operator respectively,

∇φmσ ∝ nmσ = ψ†RmσψRmσ + ψ†LmσψLmσ,
∇θmσ ∝ jmσ = ψ†RmσψRmσ − ψ†LmσψLmσ.

(7g)

(7h)

Thus the four-fermion density-density and current-
current interaction can be bosonized into quadratic terms
in the bosonic Hamiltonian.

Furthermore, the ﬁelds φmσ and θmσ can be decom-

posed into their charge and spin degrees of freedom,

φmσ =

θmσ =

1
√2
1
√2

(φcm + σφsm) ,

(θcm + σθsm) .

(7i)

(7j)

Since both charge and spin are conserved, φcm(θcm) and
φsm(θsm) can be diagonalized separately in the quadratic
part of the bosonic Hamiltonian H B
0 . The diagonaliza-
tion can be carried out explicitly by the following trans-
formation,

,

(8)

where µ = c, s refers to charge and spin components.

Near the Fermi points, the energy dispersion ξkm can

be linearized as

ξkm = vF m (k − kF m) ,

(9)

where vF m is the Fermi velocity and kF m is the Fermi
momentum. According to the DFT calculation, the dif-
ference between vF 0 and vF±1 is small. As we will show
below, the Fermi velocity is renormalized by the forward
scattering, thus this small diﬀerence is inessential and we
will approximate vF 0 = vF±1 = vF at ﬁrst.

The bosonized Hamiltonian H B also consists of two

parts,

H B = H B

0 + H B

int.

(10)

H B
0 is the quadratic or non-interacting part, and H B
the interacting part. The non-interacting part H B

The spin-charge separation is reﬂected in vcm 6= vsm,
which is similar to single band Tomonaga-Luttinger liq-
uids. The diﬀerence between single-band and three-band
model is the following. For the single-band model, all
the forward scattering processes contribute to the bosonic
non-interacting Hamiltonian H B
0 . However, for the three-
band model, some g(2) forward scattering processes con-
tribute to the interacting part H B
int but not the non-
interacting part H B
0 , which can be seen in Eq. (13) below.
This diﬀerence is due to the fact that there is only par-
tial forward scattering processes that can be expressed
in the form of density-density or current-current interac-
tion, renormalizing the Tomonaga-Luttinger parameters
Kµν.

(12d)

Note that we have omitted the coupling constants with
zero initial values in the derivation of H B
0 . These cou-
pling constants do not ﬂow under the RG transforma-
tion. We have also dropped all the g(3) umklapp scat-
tering processes, which is negligible when the fermion
system is away from half-ﬁlling. All the g(4) and f (4)
scattering processes happen within the same chirality and
have small momentum transfer. These small-momentum-
transfer terms is irrelevant in the sense of RG. In fact, the
g(4) terms will renormalize both vµν and Kµν. However,
if one expands vµν and Kµν in power of g(4), the ﬁrst or-
der terms will vanish. So that we can safely neglect g(4)
and f (4) in both H B
int in perturbation RG, which
will not change the conclusions of our perturbation RG
analysis in remaining parts of this paper.

Unlike the non-interacting situation in H B
0 , here we re-
tain the terms with zero initial values of coupling con-
stants in H B
. These terms will
be automatically generated in the one-loop RG to form
the closed algebra of operator product expansion (OPE).
Since diﬀerent scattering processes may give rise to the
same form in the bosonized Hamiltonian, we have incor-
porated them into a single term, e.g. g(1)
terms.
3k
As mentioned before, both the forward and back scatter-
ing processes will contribute to H B
int in the three-band
case, which is diﬀerent from the single-band case.

and g(2)
3k

The non-interacting Hamiltonian H B
0

describes a
three-band Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, which is a Gaus-
sian ﬁxed point under RG transformation. In the remain-
ing sections, we shall treat the interacting part H B
int as a
perturbation and perform RG analysis to investigate its
relevance. The (most) relevant terms in H B
int will give
the low energy eﬀective ﬁeld theories. In such eﬀective
ﬁeld theories, the ﬁelds φµν and θµν will be locked around
some saddle points, say, the extrema of cosine functions
in Eq. (13), which gives rise to some ordered states or rel-
evant instabilities. To classify such orders or instabilities,

we shall introduce order parameters in the next section
at ﬁrst.

V. ORDER PARAMETER

To characterize diﬀerent eﬀective ﬁeld theories in low
energies, we shall introduce order parameters in this sec-
tion. In general, the order parameter can be deﬁned as
fermionic bilinear, or more precisely, long-ranged corre-
lation of bilinear fermionic operators. By this deﬁnition,
there are two classes of order parameters in such a three-
band system. One is deﬁned in the particle-hole channels,

Oij

ph = Xmm′σσ′

mm′ τ j
λi

σσ′ ψ†RmσψLm′σ′ ,

(14a)

and the other is deﬁned in particle-particle channels (or
their Hermitian conjugates in hole-hole channels),

Oij

pp = Xmm′σσ′

σλi

mm′ τ j

σσ′ ψ†Rmσψ†

Lm′ ¯σ′

.

(14b)

7

Here λi(i = 1,··· , 8) are Gell-Mann matrices, τ j (j =
1, 2, 3) are Pauli matrices. We have also deﬁned λ0 and σ0
as 3×3 and 2×2 unit matrices respectively. ψpmσ(ψ†pmσ)
is the electron annihilation (creation) operator with chi-
rality p, band m and spin σ.

Note that we only keep opposite-chirality terms, ψ†RψL
and ψ†Rψ†L in Eq. (14) and ignore equal-chirality terms,
such as ψ†RψR, ψ†LψL, ψ†Rψ†R, and ψ†Lψ†L. This is be-
cause four-fermion operators in the same chirality, e.g.
ψ†Rψ†Rψ†RψR and ψ†RψRψ†RψR are all irrelevant in the
sense of RG. Physically, all our familiar ordered states,
including charge density wave (CDW), spin density wave

(SDW), and superconducting (SC) states, arise from
scattering or pairing in opposite chiralities. Therefore,
Eq. (14) contains all possible physically relevant order
parameters constructed by fermionic bilinears.

We shall identify physical ordered states for each order
parameters in Eq. (14) and bosonize them. For particle-
ph refers to CDW and Oi1−3
hole channels, we ﬁnd that Oi0
refer to the three components of SDW. There are total 9×
4 = 36 order parameters in particle-hole channels. Below
we only list 4 λ1-components as examples, which involve
only two E′ bands with m = ±1. After bosonization,
these four order parameters read

It means that the order parameters Oi1−3

not change under the phase shift given in Eq. (17). This
can be veriﬁed by the bosonization formula Eq. (7) too.
In the following RG analysis, the coupling constants
will ﬂow to zero if they are irrelevant and to strong cou-
pling limit if they are relevant. The relevant coupling
constants will lock the corresponding bosonic ﬁelds θµν
and φµν around the saddle points, say, in the extremum
of cosine or sine functions to minimize the action. If we
substitute these saddle-point values of bosonic ﬁelds into
the order parameters, we will obtain the nonzero order
parameters. For instance, the saddle point

VI. RENORMALIZATION-GROUP ANALYSIS

The quadratic part of the Hamiltonian, H B

0 , is a well
deﬁned Gaussian ﬁxed point under RG, describing the
three-band TLLs at high temperatures, which servers as
a good starting point for our study. In this section, we
begin with the quadratic (non-interacting) part H B
0 and
treat the nonquadratic (interacting) part H B
int by a RG
method perturbatively. We shall use OPE method24 to
derive the RG equations for the 13 coupling constants in
Eq. (13) up to one loop.

The general form of one-loop perturbative RG equa-

tions read

dgk
dl

= (d − ∆k) gk −Xij

C k

ij gigj,

(19)

where gk represents the coupling constants (g’s and f ’s)
in H B
int in Eq. (13). The linear term in Eq. (19) is the
tree-level contribution and depends on space-time dimen-
sion d and scaling dimension ∆k. The quadratic terms
are the one-loop contributions. The coeﬃcients C k
ij are
the structure constants of the OPE, which can be ob-
tained by the fusion of arbitrary two terms in H B
int. This
process will generate new terms, which are absent in the
original microscopic Hamiltonian, until all terms form a
closed algebra. This is the reason why we retain the terms
with zero initial values of coupling constants in Eq. (13).
In the spirit of perturbation theory, we shall ﬁrstly
derive and analyze RG equations at tree-level, and then
carry out one-loop analysis in the remaining parts of this
section.

In the formulation of Abelian bosonization, Eqs. (7),
the variables y(2)
in Eqs. (A3) and (21)
2k
only appear in the quardratic part H B
in the original
0
microscopic Hamiltonian, thus do not ﬂow under the
RG transformation. So that we use their initial values
y(2)
in tree-level
2k
analysis. However, this formulation does not conserve
spin rotational symmetry. We shall discuss how to restore
spin SU (2) symmetry in the next subsection, where y(2)
,
2k
y(2)
can be expressed in terms of the 13 coupling
2⊥
constants in Eq. (13) and make the RG equations close.
The slope { 1
dl } around the Tomonaga-
Luttinger liquid ﬁxed point will determine which cou-
pling constants are relevant. In weak coupling, this slope
is given by the initial values of the coupling constants in
Eq. (6), say, the microscopic Hamiltonian with two pa-
rameters U > 0 and J > 0. We ﬁnd that there exist three
parameters regions. (1) For 0 < J < U/3, the coupling
constants x(1)
are relevant, other coupling
3k
constants are irrelevant. (2) For U/3 < J < U/2, there
and y(2)
are only two relevant coupling constants, y(1)
.
1⊥
2k
(3) For the unphysical region J > U/2, there are four rel-
evant coupling constants, y(1)
. How-
2k
ever, the above analysis relies largely on tree-level RG
equations. We now proceed to one-loop RG equations
for further study.

The key to analyze these one-loop RG equations is to
ﬁnd ﬁxed points, where the coupling constants will no
longer ﬂow under RG transformation25. We rewrite the
RG equations in vector form

d~y
dl ≡ ~R (~y) ,

(23)

where ~y = {yi} is the vector of 13 running coupling con-
stants, and ~R (~y) is a vector function of ~y. By deﬁnition,
the ﬁxed points ~y = ~y∗ are given by

~R (~y∗) = 0.

(24)

It is obvious that ~y∗ = 0 is the trivial Tomonaga-
Luttinger liquid ﬁxed point. Nontrivial ﬁxed points
~y∗ 6= 0 can be found in perturbation as follows.
In perturbation, we are able to ﬁnd nontrivial ﬁxed
points in two diﬀerent parameter regions of the micro-
scopic Hamiltonian.

(1) For 0 < J < U/3, we have nontrivial ﬁxed points
characterized by the following nonvanishing coupling con-
stants,

y(1)
3k
y(2)
1⊥
x(1)
3k

= y(1)∗
3k
= y(2)∗1⊥
= x(1)∗
3k

,

,

,

(25)

while other coupling constants are all zero.

(2) For J > U/3, nontrivial ﬁxed points are given by

y(1)
2k
y(2)
1⊥

= y(1)∗
2k
= y(2)∗1⊥

,

,

(26)

while other coupling constants equal zero.

These nontrivial ﬁxed points form hypersurfaces in the
13-dimensional parameter space of coupling constants.
By examining the RG ﬂow around these hypersurfaces,
we ﬁnd that these ﬁxed points are phase transition points
rather than stable ﬁxed points describing stable phases.
Then we shall analyze the RG ﬂow near the ﬁxed points
using one-loop RG equations to ﬁnd out what kind of
instabilities are favored.

In the vicinity of the ﬁxed points, the RG equations

can be expanded to linear order

~R (~y) = ~R ((~y − ~y∗) + ~y∗) ≃ W (~y − ~y∗) ,

where the W matrix is deﬁned as

Wab =

∂Ra
∂yb |~y=~y∗ .

(27)

(28)

We diagonalize the W matrix with the left-eigenvectors
φα,

φT
α W = φT

α λa,

(29)

where λα are corresponding eigenvalues. The scaling
ﬁelds are deﬁned as

vα = φT

α (~y − ~y∗) .

(30)

Under RG these scaling ﬁelds show diﬀerent behaviors,

dvα
dl

= φT
α

d
dl
= λavα,

(~y − ~y∗) = φT

α W (~y − ~y∗) = λaφT

α (~y − ~y∗)
(31)

which becomes relevant, irrelevant and marginal when
λα > 0, λα < 0 and λα = 0, respectively.

J > U/3,

(33)

Let us now summarize the one-loop RG analysis by us-
ing OPE and present the phase diagram which are listed
in Table II and III. In the region 0 < J < U/3, the most
relevant instability is the spin-singlet SC instability with
order parameter O20
pp. At U/3 < J < U/2, the spin-triplet

SC instability with order parameter O23
pp is favored. In
the region J > U/2 (since U = U′ + 2J, U′ < 0 in this
region), the SDW instability with order parameter O03
ph
will dominate. The phase diagram is shown in Fig. 5.

VII. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

Now we shall relate our theory to experimental results
of K2Cr3As3. Firstly, we would like to discuss NMR and
NQR experiments. The spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1
in a NMR experiment measures the local spin correla-
tion which sums over q in the momentum space. The
dominant contribution comes from q ∼ 0 and q ∼ 2kF
components. For a three-band Tomonaga-Luttinger liq-
uid governed by the Hamiltonian H B
in Eq. (11), we
0
have the following temperature dependence of 1/T1 (see
Appendix C for details),

1

T1 ∝ A T + B T 1− U

2πvF ,

(41)

where U is the eﬀective on-site intra-orbital electron in-
teraction. The ﬁrst linearly temperature dependent term
follows Korringa law as in Fermi liquids. The second
term follows power law with a non-integer exponent as
long as U 6= 0. When electron Coulomb repulsion governs
the system, U is positive, the dominant contribution at
low temperatures will come from the second term. The
spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 will exhibit non-integer
power law temperature dependence. However, U may
become negative eﬀectively, e.g., when electron-phonon
interaction dominates over Coulomb repulsion.
In this
case, 1/T1 will become linearly temperature dependent
at low temperatures as in Fermi liquids. It is consistent
with the well-known single-band result that SDW will

become irrelevant when U < 0. In the NQR experiment
on K2Cr3As3, 1/T1 exhibits non-integer power law tem-
perature dependence and gives rise to 1 − U
2πvF ∼ 0.75.
However, the NQR experiment on Rb2Cr3As3 shows lin-
ear temperature dependence at high temperature while
critical spin ﬂuctuations appear near to the SC transi-
tion temperature Tc. These diversiﬁed 1/T1 behaviors in
K2Cr3As3 and Rb2Cr3As3 imply diﬀerent eﬀective elec-
tron interaction in the two systems. The Rb compound
has large unit cell volume than K compound, resulting
in a smaller electron repulsion, which is consistent with
larger exponent, 1 − U
We next discuss two possible SC ground states in phys-
ical parameter regions 0 < J < U/3 and U/3 < J < U/2.
(1) At 0 < J < U/3, the order parameter O20
pp indicates
that the SC pairing is spin-singlet and orbital antisym-
metric, and the pairing electrons come from the two de-
generate E′ bands. (2) While for U/3 < J < U/2, the
order parameter O23
pp gives rise to spin-triplet (|↑↓i+|↓↑i)
and orbital antisymmetric SC pairing, and the pairing
electrons come from E′ bands too. This kind of even-
parity, spin-triplet and orbital antisymmetric SC pairing
was ﬁrstly proposed by Dai et al. in the context of iron-
pnictide26. Note that the degeneracy of two E′ bands
plays a crucial role in the formation of SC ground states.
The role of the two degenerate E′ bands can be also
seen from the eﬀective Hamiltonian H B
int and order pa-
rameters for diﬀerent ground states. To do this, we
consider the situation when the two-fold degeneracy is
slightly lifted, for instance, by inter-chain coupling, In
this case, we have kF +1 6= kF−1.
Introducing ∆kF =
kF +1 − kF−1, we can generalize the bosonic interacting
Hamiltonian in Eq. (13) to the expression in Eq. (D1)
in Appendix D, where an additional phase factor 2∆kF x
appears in g(1)
terms. Thus these terms
2k
will be suppressed by this phase factor in the integrand.
Consequently, both the spin-triplet SC order parameter
O20
pp (for U/3 < J < U/2) and the spin-singlet SC order
parameter O23
pp (for 0 < J < U/3) will be suppressed and
be modulated by the phase factor 2∆kF x, indicating a
possible FFLO state when ∆kF 6= 027,28. This is because
that both O20
pp arise from inter-orbital pairing,
namely, pairing between ±kF +1 and ∓kF−1.

Then we shall investigate how the lifted degeneracy will

rameters, O03

The expression for O43
ph will not change as
we turn on ∆kF . Since SDW instabilites in these states
come from the scattering from ±kF +1 to ∓kF−1. How-
ever, the order parameter O03
ph arising from intra-
orbital scattering, say, from ±kF +1 to ±kF−1, will be
suppressed and be modulated by the phase factor 2∆kF x
too.

Thus, we expect that (1) for 0 < J < U/3, the SDW
states will win out since the SSC state is suppressed; (2)
for U/3 < J < U/2, the TSC state will survive and be
modulated by a phase factor 2∆kF x, since the possible
competing SDW order (O03
ph) will be suppressed
too; (3) for the unphysical region J > U/2, the SDW
state will be modulated by a phase factor 2∆kF x. The
new phase diagram is illustrated in Fig. 6.

Finally, we would like to point out that these ordered
states will not survive in a single chain due to strong
quantum ﬂuctuations, as stated by Mermin-Wagner-
Hohenberg theorm29,30. However, these instabilities will
be enhanced at low temperatures, so that small inter-
chain couplings will stabilize these ordered states. More-
over, the inter-chain couplings will also determine the
spatial pairing symmetry for SC states. Work along this
line is under progress.

In summary, we have studied a three-band Hubbard
model at incommensurate ﬁlling with intra-orbital elec-
tron repulsion U , inter-orbital electron repulsion U′ =
U − 2J, and Hund’s coupling J > 0. With the help
of bosonization and RG, we ﬁnd that the Tomonaga-
Luttinger ﬁxed point gives rise to the experimental ob-
served normal state at high temperature. The ground

state instability depends on the ratio J/U and the de-
generacy of E′ bands. When the two E′ bands are de-
generate, for 0 < J < U/3, the ground state is a spin-
singlet SC state; for U/3 < J < U/2, a spin-triplet SC
state is favored; a SDW state can be achieved in the pa-
rameter region J > U/2. However, when the two-fold
degeneracy of E′ bands is lifted, the phase diagram will
change. In the physically relevant regions, a SDW state
may dominate instead of the spin-singlet SC state when
0 < J < U/3, the spin-triplet SC state is still favored
when U/3 < J < U/2; but the SC order parameter will
be modulated by a spatially varying phase factor 2∆kF x.

Appendix A: Derivation of tree-level RG equations

The tree-level RG equations are given by the scaling
dimension ∆k for each coupling constant gk. Since ∆k
is determined by Tomonaga-Luttinger parameters Kµν,

To simplify, we introduce the renormalized coupling
constants xi and yi as deﬁned in Eq. (20). In weak cou-
pling, we can expand Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid param-
eters Kµν to leading order of xi and yi’s,

Kµν = 1 − yµν ,

ters yµν are linear combinations of yi’s,

Then the tree-level RG equations Eqs. (A1) can be writ-

Appendix B: Derivation of one-loop RG equations

The full structure constants C k

ij in OPE in Eq. (19) can
be obtained by the fusion of arbitrary two terms in the
interaction H B
int. This processes will generate new terms,
which are absent in the original microscopic Hamiltonian,
until all terms form a closed algebra. Thus we should re-
tain the related terms with zero initial values of coupling
constants. The one-loop RG equations from OPE read,

For a system where spin rotational symmetry is re-
spected, χαβ = χδαβ. We ﬁnd that the dominant con-
tribution to χ come from q ∼ 0 and q ∼ 2kF compo-
nents. Summing over all the bands, we have the fol-
lowing form of the temperature dependent spin-lattice
relaxation rate,

(C3)
The ﬁrst linearly temperature dependent term follows
Korringa law as in Fermi liquids. The second term comes
from the two degenerate bands m = ±1 and both have
the same exponent. The third term comes from the non-
degenerate band m = 0.
In the non-interacting limit,
Kµν = 1, thus all the three terms become linearly tem-
perature dependent as in Fermi liquids.

With the help of spin rotational symmetry, we can fur-
ther simplify the expression in Eq. (C3). Considering the
spin correlation function χαβ = χδαβ in the TLL ﬁxed
point, the spin SU (2) symmetry will imposes the follow-
ing constraints to Tomonaga-Luttinger parameters,

Ksm = 1.

(C4)

Meanwhile, we have Kc+1 = Kc−1 in our model. In weak
coupling, we can expand Tomonaga-Luttinger parame-
ters as Kµν = 1 − yµν. Then the spin-lattice relaxation
rate can be simpliﬁed as

1
T1 ∝ A T + B T 1−

y

(2)

4⊥2 ,

(C5)

where the coupling constant y(2)
is chosen as its initial
4⊥
value y(2)
= U/πvF . When the short ranged Coulomb
4⊥
repulsion govern the system, U is positive, the domi-
nant contribution will come from the second term at low
temperatures. The spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 will
exhibit non-integer power law temperature dependence.
However, U may become negative eﬀectively, e.g., when
electron-phonon interaction dominates. In this case, 1/T1
will become linearly temperature dependent at low tem-
peratures as in Fermi liquids. It is consistent with the
common sense that SDW terms will become irrelevant
when U < 0.

where Af is the hyperﬁne coupling constant. The spin
correlation function in a multi-band system is deﬁned as

When the degeneracy of the two E′ bands is lifted,

taining phase ˜φc+1 ∝ φc+1 − φc−1 should change with a
phase factor ∆kF x, resulting in the interacting Hamilto-
nian H B
