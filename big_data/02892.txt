Superconductivity at 9 K in Mo5PB2with evidence for multiple gaps

Materials Science and Technology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831 USA

Michael A. McGuire∗ and David S. Parker

Superconductivity is observed with critical temperatures near 9 K in the tetragonal compound Mo5PB2. This
material adopts the Cr5B3 structure type common to supercondcuting Nb5Si3−xBx, Mo5SiB2, and W5SiB2,
which have critical temperatures of 5.8−7.8 K. We have synthesized polycrystalline samples of the compound,
made measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity, and performed ﬁrst prin-
ciples electronic structure calculations. The highest Tc value (9.2 K) occurs in slightly phosphorus rich samples,
with composition near Mo5P1.1B1.9, and the upper critical ﬁeld Hc2 at T = 0 is estimated to be ≈ 17 kOe. To-
gether, the measurements and band structure calculations indicate intermediate coupling (λ = 1.0), phonon me-
diated superconductivity. The temperature dependence of the heat capacity and upper critical ﬁeld Hc2 below
Tc suggest multiple superconducting gaps may be present.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The tetragonal Cr5B3 structure type is adopted by a wide
variety of binary and ternary compounds with examples in-
corporating at least 47 different elements spanning the main
group, transitions metals, and rare-earth metals [1]. One of
the more interesting subsets of these compounds is the ternary
borides with stoichiometries M5XB2, with X = P,Si. These
are reported to form with many transition metals (M) includ-
ing the 3d transition metals from V to Co, the 4d transition
metals Nb and Mo, and the 5d transition metal W. Mn5SiB2
and Mn5PB2 are ferromagnets with Curie temperatures near
room temperature and are of interest for magnetocaloric ap-
plications [2, 3]. Fe5SiB2 and Fe5PB2 are uniaxial ferro-
magnets with high Curie temperatures, and a low temperature
spin-reorientation in the case of the silicide, and have been
studied as potential permanent magnet materials [4–7].
In
striking contrast to these high temperature ferromagnets, the
4d and 5d compounds Nb5SiB2, Mo5SiB2, and W5SiB2 are
superconductors with transition temperatures of 7.2, 5.8, and
5.8 K, respectively [8–10]. The occurrence of superconductiv-
ity in these borosilicide compounds brings to mind other well
known boron-containing, phonon-mediated superconductors,
including the borocarbides RT2B2C (R = rare-earth element,
T = Ni, Pd, Pt) [11] and magnesium diboride MgB2 [12].

The observation of superconductivity in several examples
of Cr5B3-type compounds with the 512 stoichiometry sug-
gests that further examination may produce more examples
in this relatively new group of superconductors [9].
In the
present work, we have studied the analogous Mo5PB2, and

ﬁnd that it too is a superconductor. The superconducting criti-
cal temperature (Tc) is determined to be as high as 9.2 K. This
is the highest Tc yet reported for superconductors in this struc-
ture type. In addition to measurements of resistivity, magnetic
susceptibility, and heat capacity, we report results of ﬁrst prin-
ciples calculations that reveal the presence of multiple bands
crossing the Fermi level in this borophosphide and the related
borosilicides, as seen in, for example, the iron-based super-
conductors including the phosphide LaFePO [13], as well as
MgB2 [14]. Calculations indicate the coupling in Mo5PB2 is
in the intermediate limit (i.e.
the electron-phonon coupling
λ ≈ 1). Analysis of the heat capacity and upper critical ﬁeld
data suggests the presence of two distinct energy gaps. To-
gether the experimental and theoretical results indicate that
Mo5PB2 may be a multiband superconductor.

II. PROCEDURES

Polycrystalline

samples with nominal

compositions
Mo5P0.9B2.1, Mo5PB2, and Mo5P1.1B1.9 were prepared
from hydrogen-reduced molybdenum powder (99.999%),
phosphorus pieces (99.999%), and boron powder (99.5%).
The elements were reacted together at 1050◦C for 16−24
hours, and the resulting powders were pressed into cylindrical
pellets and heated at 1100−1150◦C for a total duration of up
to eight days, with intermediate grinding and re-pelletizing.
Crystals of the isostructural Fe5PB2 have been grown from
an Fe-P melt [7]; however,
there is no liquid region on
the Mo-rich side of the Mo-P phase diagram below about
1700◦C. The optical ﬂoating zone method has been used
to grow crystals of Mo5SiB2 [15]; however, arc-melting
experiments in our lab indicate that Mo5PB2 does not melt
congruently, and the volatility of phosphorus may preclude
this type of crystal growth. The most likely route to single
crystal Mo5PB2 may be the molten metal ﬂux technique
[16, 17], if a suitable ﬂux can be identiﬁed.

Powder X-ray diffraction was performed using monochro-
matic Cu Kα1 radiation with a PANalytical X’Pert Pro diffrac-
tometer and analyzed using the Rietveld technique with the
Fullprof software package [18]. Magnetization measurements
were performed with a Quantum Design Magnetic Property
Measurement System (MPMS) and Physical Property Mea-

surement System (PPMS). The PPMS was also used for mea-
surements of electrical resistivity and heat capacity. The heat
capacity data were analyzed using both the conventional re-
laxation method employing small heat pulses (temperature
rise of 2% of the sample temperature) and slope-analysis [19]
of large heat pulse data (temperature rise of 30% of the sample
temperature).

First principles density functional theory calculations of the
electronic structure of Mo5PB2 were performed using the lin-
earized augmented plane-wave (LAPW) code WIEN2K [20],
employing the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew,
Burke and Ernzerhof [21]. LAPW sphere radii of 2.41, 2.08
and 1.7 Bohr, respectively for Mo, P, and B were chosen with
an RKmax of 7.0, where RKmax is the product of the smallest
sphere radius and the largest plane-wave expansion wavevec-
tor. Internal coordinates were relaxed until forces on the ions
were less than 2 mRy/Bohr.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Rietveld analysis showed the resulting purity of the samples
to be 92, 89, and 92% by weight for samples with nominal
compositions Mo5P0.9B2.1, Mo5PB2, and Mo5P1.1B1.9, re-
spectively. Mo3P and MoB were observed as impurity phases
in all samples. Reﬁnement results are shown for Mo5P1.1B1.9
in Figure 1a, where the crystal structure is shown in the inset.
Table I contains the reﬁned crystallographic properties of the
Mo5PB2 phase in each sample. Allowing mixed occupation
of P and B on their respective sites suggested some P may re-
side on the B site, but did not indicate any mixing of B onto
the P site. The compositions determined from the reﬁned oc-
cupancies are listed in the Table. Adding excess P (relative
to Mo5PB2) appears to signiﬁcantly increase the P content of
the main phase, as indicated by both the reﬁned composition
as well as the increase in the unit cell volume. Addition of
excess B had no detectable effect on the atomic site occupan-
cies (relative to Mo5PB2) and produced only a small decrease
in the unit cell volume. These observations indicate that there
is some phase width in Mo5PB2 with respect to the P and B
ratio, a common feature in this structure-type [7, 8, 22–24],
and that in this case excess P is favored.

Figure 1b and 1c show the ac magnetic susceptibility and
resistivity measured below 10 K. All of the samples are su-
perconducting. Values of Tc are determined by the onset of
diamagnetism (Fig. 1b) and the temperature at which the
resistivity reaches zero (Fig. 1c). These are listed for each
sample in Table I. Similar values of Tc = 8.7−8.9 K are seen
in the Mo5P0.9B2.1 and Mo5PB2 samples, which have sim-
ilar stoichiometries as discussed above. A higher value of
Tc = 9.2 K is seen in Mo5P1.1B1.9. This demonstrates the sen-
sitivity of the superconductivity to the chemical composition
of the Mo5PB2 phase. Further experimental analysis pre-
sented here will focus primarily on the Mo5P1.1B1.9 sample.
The Tc values seen in these materials are the highest yet re-
ported in this class of ternary superconductors, which include
Mo5SiB2 (Tc = 5.8 K)[9], Nb5SiB2 (Tc = 7.2 K)[9], W5SiB2
(Tc = 5.8 K)[10], W5−xTaxSiB2 (Tc = 6.5 K)[25], and the

Figure 2 shows the results of magnetization measurements
on Mo5P1.1B1.9. The dc measurements were conducted in 10
Oe ﬁeld, and the ac magnetization measurements were con-
ducted in a dc ﬁeld of 10 Oe using a frequency of 1 kHz and
an ac excitation ﬁeld of 5 Oe. The superconducting transition
is marked by the onset of diamagnetism in the dc susceptibil-
ity (χdc) and the real part of the ac susceptibility (χ′), while
the imaginary part (χ′′) peaks just below Tc. The large dia-
magnetic signal in both ﬁeld-cooled (fc) and zero ﬁeld cooled
(zfc) measurements demonstrates the bulk nature of the super-
conductivity. Complete magnetic ﬂux exclusion corresponds
to a volume susceptibility of -1/4π in the units used here.
This corresponds to a mass susceptibility of 0.0089 cm3/g us-
ing the single crystal density of 8.97 g/cm3 determined from
the structure reﬁnements presented above. Thus, the shielding

FIG. 2. Results from (a) dc and (b) ac magnetization measurements
on Mo5P1.1B1.9. The dc data show both zero-ﬁeld-cooled (zfc) and
ﬁeld-cooled (fc) results. The ac data were collected in zfc mode and
both the real (χ’) and imaginary (χ”) parts of the ac susceptibility are
shown. The superconducting transition temperature Tc determined
by the onset of diamagnetism is indicated by the dashed line.

fraction indicated by the data in Figure 2a exceeds unity by
almost a factor of two. This may be attributed to geometri-
cal and demagnetization effects in these samples, which were
loosely compacted powders in irregular shapes. A shielding
volume fraction of 120% was observed (with no demagneti-
zation correction) for a denser sample that was cold pressed at
high pressure between tungsten carbide anvils.

Resistivity data for polycrystalline Mo5P1.1B1.9 are shown
2K/ρ300K = 11,

in Figure 3. The residual resistivity ratio is ρ2T

relatively high considering the polycrystalline nature of the
sample. The resistivity varies like T 2.4 above Tc up to about
60 K. Above about 100 K, ρ(T ) displays a negative curva-
ture rather than the linear behavior expected for most met-
als. The normal state temperature dependence is similar to
that reported for Mo5SiB2 [9] and W5SiB2 [10], and the neg-
ative curvature at higher temperatures has been observed as
a common feature in a variety of chemically related com-
pounds, based on Mo5X3 (x = Si, B, C) [26]. This behavior
is also seen in the A15-type superconductors, where Fisk and
Webb concluded that resistivity saturation results from the ap-
proach to the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit [27]. This occurs when
the electron mean free path reaches a minimum value deﬁned
by the lattice constant [28, 29]. Gurvitch [30] cast the re-
sulting relationship between the saturation resistivity ρsat in
µΩcm, the carrier concentration n in cm−3, and lattice pa-
rameter a in ˚A (assuming cubic symmetry) into the follow-
ing useful form: ρsat = 1.29 × 1018/(n2/3a) µΩcm. Hall
effect measurements on Mo5P1.1B1.9 give a Hall coefﬁcient
of RH ≈ -3.1×10−4 cm3/C. From this, in a simple one band
model, a carrier concentration of 2×1022 electrons per cm3 is
inferred. Using this value of n and the average lattice constant
of (2a + c)/3 = 7.7 ˚A gives ρsat = 230 µΩcm. The resistivity
data in Figure 3 exceed this value by about 60% at room tem-
perature, which may be attributed to the polycrystalline na-
ture of the sample with resistive grain boundaries. However,
this estimated ρsat does compare well with data reported for
several isostructural M5SiB2 compounds that have been mea-
sured up to 1000 K [26].

Resistivity data collected in applied magnetic ﬁelds are
shown in the upper inset of Figure 3. In zero ﬁeld the resistive
transition is very sharp, with a width of <
∼ 0.1 K. The tran-
sition broadens as magnetic ﬁeld is applied, with the width
increasing to 0.7 K at 12.5 kOe. This is typical behavior of
a type II superconductor. From the resistivity data, the ﬁeld
dependence of Tc is obtained, where Tc is deﬁned as the tem-
perature at which ρ → 0. The results are shown in the lower
inset of Fig. 3, which also include results from the same anal-
ysis applied to the sample of nominal composition Mo5PB2.
From this data, an upper critical ﬁeld Hc2(0) of ≈17 kOe can
be estimated. This is signiﬁcantly larger than in the closely re-
lated superconductors Mo5SiB2 and W5SiB2, for which val-

FIG. 3. Resistivity of Mo5P1.1B1.9 in zero applied magnetic ﬁeld
is shown in the main panel. The upper inset shows the effect of
magnetic ﬁeld on Tc, which is plotted in the lower inset. The lower
inset also includes data from the Mo5PB2 sample for comparison.

ues of 6 kOe and 5 kOe, respectively, are reported [9, 10].
Nearly linear behavior, with a slight positive curvature near
H = 0, is observed up to ﬁelds of 12.5 kOe in Figure 3. Fit-
ting this range gives a slope of -2.1 kOe/T. From this value,
the WHH expression Hc2(0) = −0.693Tc(dHc2/dT )|T =Tc
gives Hc2(0) = 13 kOe. This is not compatible with the re-
sistivity data collected at H = 15 kOe (Fig. 3), for which
Tc ≈ 1.5 K can be estimated (Fig. 3). This discrepancy is a
direct result of the nearly linear relationship between mag-
netic ﬁeld and Tc over a wide range of ﬁelds. A similar
shape of Hc2 vs Tc is seen in W5SiB2 [10], but reports for
Mo5SiB2 show clear negative curvature over most of the tem-
perature range [9], more consistent with expectations based
on the WHH theory. The observed temperature dependence of
the upper critical ﬁeld Hc2 in polycrystalline Mo5PB2 may be
an indication of contributions from multiple superconducting
gaps arising from underlying crystalline anisotropy or from
multiple superconducting bands. Similar shapes have been
observed in several multigap superconductors including poly-
crystalline MgB2 [31] and LaFeAsO0.89F0.11 [32], and single
crystals of borocarbides [33], dichalcogenides [34, 35], and
more recently TlNi2Se2 [36].

Results of heat capacity measurements on Mo5P1.1B1.9 are
shown in Figure 4. Rietveld reﬁnement of the powder x-ray
diffraction data shows that this sample contains 7 wt. % of
Mo3P, which is a superconductor with Tc reported of 5−7 K
[37–39]. For this study, an Mo3P sample was synthesized and
its heat capacity was measured and subtracted from the to-
tal heat capacity measured for the Mo5P1.1B1.9 sample after
scaling by the x-ray diffraction determined concentration. The
measured Tc for the Mo3P sample was 5.5 K. See Appendix
for additional data and information.

FIG. 4. Heat capacity of Mo5P1.1B1.9, after correction for the 7
wt. % Mo3P impurity (see Appendix). The total heat capacity cP
is shown in (a), near Tc in the main panel and up to 300 K in the
inset. The electronic component of the heat capacity determined by
subtracting data collected at H = 30 kOe from data taken in zero ﬁeld
is shown in (b) plotted as ce/T . The solid line in (b) is at ce/T = γ.

At 300 K the heat capacity of Mo5P1.1B1.9 reaches 86%
of the Dulong-Petit limit (Fig. 4a, inset). The increase in
heat capacity upon cooling into the superconducting state is
centered at Tc = 9.2 K. The magnitude of the heat capacity
jump is determined to be 43.2 mJ/mol-at./K. Data collected
at 30 kOe show that this ﬁeld is sufﬁcient to suppress the su-
perconductivity to below 2 K, consistent with the resistivity
results above that show Hc2(0) ≈ 17 kOe. Figure 4b shows
the electronic portion of the heat capacity, determined by sub-
tracting the data collected at 30 kOe. The 30 kOe data is well
described up to 9 K by cP (T ) = γT + βT 3, as shown by
the black line through the data in Figure 4a. This ﬁt gives a
normal state Sommerﬁeld coefﬁcient of γ = 3.16(1) mJ/mol-
at./K2 and a Debye temperature of 492(2) K. Similar values
were obtained from the same analysis of heat capacity data
(not shown) for the Mo5PB2 sample. These values are com-
pared with other isostructural superconductors in Table II.

Results of electronic band structure calculations are shown
in Figure 5a. Six bands are observed to cross the Fermi level,

with several bands contributing strongly to the the total den-
sity of states (DOS). The partial Fermi-level DOS in these
bands (per unit cell per eV, both spins) is found to be 2.06,
4.66, 1.90, 1.10, 0.96, and 0.04, for a total Fermi level DOS
N (EF ) of 10.7 per eV per unit cell. With 10 Mo per unit cell
and the majority of the DOS being Mo (Fig. 5b), N (EF ) is
somewhat enhanced relative to elemental Mo itself, which has
N (EF ) of 0.65 / eV [40], but not to a degree that would sug-
gest a magnetic instability. This argues in favor of a phononic
pairing mechanism.

The value of γ determined from the calculated band struc-
ture (Fig. 5a) is 1.57 mJ/mol-at./K2. This is signiﬁcantly
lower than the observed value of 3.16 mJ/mol-at./K2. This
enhancement by a factor of 2.01 (= 1+λ) gives an electron-
phonon coupling constant λ of approximately 1, indicating
intermediate coupling. For a single-band s-wave scenario,
Eliashberg theory [41] gives a reduced speciﬁc heat jump of
approximately 2 for elemental Nb, which has a similar λ. The
observed value of ∆c/γTc in Mo5PB2 is 1.49, close to the
weak-coupling BCS value, but only 75% of the value expected
based on the estimated electron-phonon coupling strength for
this compound.

In general, such a reduced speciﬁc heat jump can result
from two factors. The ﬁrst of these is gap anisotropy, in-
cluding nodal behavior as observed in the superconducting
cuprates [42] or more recently in LaFePO, a structural relative
of the high Tc iron-based superconductors [43, 44]. For exam-
ple, the BCS weak-coupling theory, applied to a single band
two dimensional d-wave material [45], predicts a reduced spe-
ciﬁc heat jump ∆c/γTc of 0.95. However, there is little evi-
dence for nodal superconductivity in Mo5PB2. For example,
the electronic speciﬁc heat in the superconducting state in Fig-
ure 4b at 1.9 K, or approximately 20 percent of Tc, is only 2
percent of the normal state value at Tc, consistent with BCS
predictions for a gapped s-wave superconductor.

The second possibility for such a reduced speciﬁc heat jump
is multiband superconductivity, as observed in MgB2 [12].
Strictly speaking this can be considered a form of anisotropy,
but here we follow the historical context and treat it separately
from the Fermi surface gap anisotropy described above. In
MgB2, well established to be an intermediate coupling multi-
band s-wave superconductor [46], the largest speciﬁc heat
jump ∆c/γTc was observed [47] to be 1.32, less than the BCS
s-wave value. The band structure calculations for Mo5PB2
support the possibility of multiband superconductivity, since
several bands contribute signiﬁcant DOS at the Fermi level.

Further evidence suggesting potential multiband behavior is
seen in the temperature dependence of the heat capacity mea-

sured below Tc. In Figure 6 we depict the heat capacity data
of Mo5PB2, along with two calculated curves: a single band
BCS ﬁt where the T = 0 gap value has been taken as the canon-
ical BCS weak-coupling value, 1.76 kBTc, and a two band ﬁt
with two gaps. The smaller gap is weighted at one third the
weight of the larger and the two gap ﬁtting yields one gap of
0.65 times the BCS value and the other gap 1.12 times the
BCS value. The relative weighting of the two band ﬁt is in
rough agreement with the highest two Fermi-level DOS val-
ues from the band structure calculations.

Experimental data from Nb, which has a similar electron-
phonon coupling λ as well as similar Tc, is included in in
Fig. 6 for comparison. The data was taken from Ref. 48.
If Mo5PB2 is a single band superconductor, as Nb is known
to be, one would expect a similar electronic speciﬁc heat
curve. Instead, one ﬁnds a speciﬁc heat jump ∆c/γTc only
slightly above the weak coupling BCS value. In addition, the
low-temperature speciﬁc heat is enhanced relative to the BCS
value, as indicated in the inset. The low-T enhancement of
the speciﬁc heat was found, in the case of MgB2 [47], to re-
sult from having one gap much smaller than the BCS value.
Often the speciﬁc heat at low temperature is taken to vary ex-
ponentially in −∆/T , where ∆ is the smallest energy gap in
the system, but the data (red diamonds) in the logarithmic plot
in the inset of Fig. 6 show a substantial curvature demon-
strating excitations across at least two gaps. The two band
ﬁt signiﬁcantly improves upon the BCS ﬁt, generating better
agreement at both low temperatures and temperatures near Tc,
though measurements on single crystals would be desirable to
support this. This is consistent with the electronic structure
calculations, ﬁnding multiple bands crossing EF .

It is of interest to compare the experimental and theoretical
results for Mo5PB2 to the isostructural compound Mo5SiB2,
which is itself a superconductor with a somewhat lower Tc of

6

5.8 K [9]. From a comparison of our calculated γ of 1.22
mJ/mol-atom-K2 for the Si compound with the γ of 2.12
mJ/mol-atom-K2 measured in Ref. 9, an electron-phonon
coupling constant λMo5SiB2 of 0.73 is determined, signiﬁ-
cantly lower than the value of 1.0 we infer for the P com-
pound. Given that the Debye temperatures of these two ma-
terials are quite similar, the lower value of λ for the Si com-
pound immediately translates to a lower Tc.

Our calculations also provide insight into the source of this
change in λ. Presented in the inset of Figure 5b are the calcu-
lated total densities-of-states of the two compounds in a win-
dow of width approximately 4 eV, centered on EF . It is ap-
parent that the densities-of-states can nearly be superimposed
upon each other in a “rigid-band” manner , with a shift of
approximately 0.2 eV corresponding directly to the 2 fewer
valence electrons of the Si compound. Since the calculated
densities-of-states both generally increase with energy around
the respective Fermi energies, the effective hole doping asso-
ciated with the substitution of Si for P lowers the Fermi level
DOS. We note that this DOS reduction from 10.7 to 8.30 per
eV per unit cell, or 22 percent, parallels the inferred 27 per-
cent λ reduction from the P compound to the Si compound.
This suggests that the electron phonon matrix element V (re-
calling that in BCS theory λ = N (EF )V ) is similar in the
two compounds, as is reasonable.
In addition, the calcula-
tions are consistent with the observation that the P-rich sample
Mo5P1.1B1.9 has a higher Tc than the Mo5PB2 sample (Table
I), since the DOS at EF (Fig. 5b) would be increased by the
substitution of P for B.

Our ﬁrst principles calculations and analysis of the experi-
mental data thus suggest that Mo5PB2 is an intermediate cou-
pling, phonon-mediated, and potentially multiband supercon-
ductor. We note that it is possible that the superconductors
Mo5SiB2 and additionally Nb5SiB2 are also multiband mate-
rials as our calculations (depicted in the Appendix) ﬁnd each
of these materials to have several bands crossing EF .

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have discovered a new superconductor, Mo5PB2, with
critical temperature Tc as high as 9.2 K. It crystallizes in a
tetragonal Cr5B3 structure shared by a number of supercon-
ductors, such as Mo5SiB2 and Nb5SiB2, and W5SiB2, and has
the highest transition temperature and upper critical ﬁeld re-
ported for this family of compounds. Electron doping is may
be expected to increase Tc further. Based on analysis of the
speciﬁc heat data as well as our ﬁrst principles calculations,
Mo5PB2 appears to be an intermediate-coupling, multi-gap,
phonon-mediated superconductor.

A. Electronic structure of Mo5SiB2 and Nb5SiB2

Figure 7 shows results from ﬁrst principles calculations for
the superconductors Mo5SiB2 and Nb5SiB2, isostructural to

Mo5PB2. These calculations were also carried out using the
LAPW method, with an RKmax of 7.0 and all internal coor-
dinates relaxed, and approximately 1000 k-points in the full
Brillouin zone used for all calculations; spin-orbit coupling
was not included. As is apparent, both these compounds have
multiple bands cutting the Fermi level, with 6 such bands for

tial multiband superconductivity in these materials, although
deﬁnitive resolution of this issue would require further inves-
tigation.

B. Heat capacity of Mo3P

Results of low temperature heat capacity measurements on
a polycrystalline sample of Mo3P are shown in Figure 8a.
The sample was prepared by reacting hydrogen-reduced Mo
powder with red phosphorus pieces in an evacuated silica am-
poule at 850◦C, then pelletizing the product and ﬁring again
at 1150◦C. This data was used to calculate the Mo3P contri-
bution to the measured heat capacity of the Mo5P1.1B1.9 sam-
ple. Figure 8b shows the total heat capacity measured from the
Mo5P1.1B1.9 sample with a total mass of 17.2 mg. Using the
x-ray diffraction determined concentration of 7 wt. % Mo3P,
the heat capacity of the Mo3P component (1.2 mg), was deter-
mined, and is also shown in the Figure. These datasets were
subtracted using OriginPro to determine the heat capacity of
15 mg of Mo5P1.1B1.9, which is shown in Figure 4.
