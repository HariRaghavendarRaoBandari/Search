Abstract. It is known that irreducible noncommutative diﬀerential struc-
tures over Fp[x] are classiﬁed by irreducible monics m. We show that the coho-
mology H 0(Fp[x]; m) = Fp[gd] if and only if Trace(m) 6= 0, where gd = xpd
− x
d
and d is the degree of m. This implies that there are p−1
k
such ‘regular’ m (µM the M¨obius function). Motivated by killing this zero’th
cohomology, we study the directed system of ﬁnite-dimensional Hopf alge-
bras Ad = Fp[x]/(gd) as well as their inherited bicovariant diﬀerential cal-
culi Ω(Ad; m). We show that Ad = Cd ⊗χ A1 a cocycle extension where
Cd = Aψ
d is the subalgebra of elements ﬁxed under ψ(x) = x + 1. We also
d
have a Frobenius-ﬁxed subalgebra Bd of dimension 1
k (φ the Eu-
ler totient function), generalising Boolean algebras when p = 2. We note
that A1 ∼= Fp(Z/pZ) the algebra of functions on the ﬁnite group Z/pZ and
we describe its diﬀerential calculus and Fourier theory. We show dually that
FpZ/pZ ∼= Fp[L]/(Lp) for a ‘lie algebra’ generator L with eL group-like, using a
truncated exponential. We show that A2 over F2 is a 1-dimensional extension
of the Boolean algebra on 3 elements and we study its noncommutative diﬀer-
entials, metrics and Levi-Civita connections within bimodule noncommutative
geometry.

1. Introduction

This article is motivated by a fundamental issue in characteristic p > 0 geometry
visible even for polynomials Fp[x] in one variable over the ﬁnite ﬁeld of order p,
namely the failure of diﬀerential calculus to provide an eﬀective tool. Speciﬁcally, on
any connected manifold the only functions killed by the exterior derivative are the
constant functions, i.e. the zeroth cohomology H 0 is spanned by 1. By contrast, the
classical diﬀerential calculus on Fp[x] has a large kernel for d, namely all polynomials
in xp. One approach is to quoient out this kernel to give the Hopf algebra Fp[x]/(xp)
and one will then have that the inherited calculus on this is now connected. On the
other hand, this Hopf algebra is rather too small to serve as an approximation of
Fp[x]. We ask if we we can do rather better by looking not at the usual diﬀerential
calculus but a noncommutative one.

A diﬀerential structure in noncommutative geometry can be expressed as a diﬀer-
ential bimodule (Ω1, d) of ‘1-forms’ with d obeying the Leibniz rule. This is more
general than classical in that we do not assume that diﬀerentials commute with
1-forms, i.e. we allow (dx)x 6= xdx. In this more general setting it is known that
irreducible calculi on Fp[x] are classiﬁed by monic irreducibles m [12, 9]. We study

the zeroth cohomology H 0(Fp[x]; m) and ﬁnd that again there is a kernel but that
in the ‘regular’ case with m of degree d, it consists of polynomials in gd = xpd
− x.
We also show that this applies precisely when the trace of m is nonzero, see our
main Theorem 3.4 in Section 3. Following the same philosophy as before, we are
led to introduce and study the Hopf algebras

Ad = Fp[x]/(gd)

again with their inherited calculus, which we show now has H 0(Ad; m) = Fp1.
The generating polynomial gd here is well-known to be the product of all monic
irreducibles of degree dividing d, from which it follows that if m|n then there is a
canonical homomorphism An → Am. This forms a directed system of Hopf algebras
ordered by divisibility so that one has an inverse limit

[Fp[x] = lim

projecting on to every Ad, as well as a map Fp[x] → [Fp[x] through which the
quotienting maps Fp[x] → Ad necessarily factor. Since each monic gives a ﬁeld

as rings, where Nk is the number of monic irreducibles of degree k; this does
not, however, take account of their possible geometric and Hopf structures. The
ﬁrst expression here can be thought of as the product over all prime ideals in
Fp[x], as an example of a more general construction. From that point of view it is

natural to think of it as a quotient mod each (m) of Qm Fp[x]m where Fp[x]m =
Fp[x]/(m)k in analogy with Qp Fp as a quotient of ˆZ = Qp Zp. The inverse

k
limit is a topic for further study and at present we focus on the structure and
geometry of the Ad individually while thinking of them loosely as increasingly good
approximations of Fp[x].

In Section 4, we show that the Ad are cocycle extensions Ad = Cd ⊗χ A1 where Cd
is a polynomial algebra in g1 with a single relation related to the trace map. In fact
this result arises uniformly from Fp[x] = Fp[g1] ⊗χ A1 where the cocycle amounts
to projection-like identities for the canonical ‘delta-functions’ δi(x) = −g1/(x − i),
namely

δiδi = δi + g1

as we show in Theorem 4.6. Here g1 is invariant under x → x + 1 while the δi
shift their index. This also implies that the Ad are (cleft) Hopf-Galois extensions
or trivial quantum principal bundles from a geometric point of view. Here A1 is
easily seen to be isomorphic to Fp(Z/pZ), so this is a version of an Artin-Schreier
covering. We also compute the dimension of the subalgebra of elements of Ad ﬁxed
under the Frobenius automorphism.

In Section 5.1 we look at the Hopf algebra Fourier theory from A1 to its dual, the
group algebra FpZ/pZ = Fp[t](tp − 1), and we show in Lemma 5.1 that the latter is
isomorphic to Fp[L]/(Lp) by t = eL, using the truncated exponential. This is more
complicated than the more obvious t = 1 + L but allows the Fourier transform

FINITE NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRIES RELATED TO Fp[x]

to have a classical form, see Corollary 5.2, as well as an interesting coproduct
on L. We also show that the Fourier transform is compatible with the regular
noncommutative diﬀerential structures on A1 and plays the same role as classically.

Finally, Section 5.2 studies the noncommutative Riemannian geometry of A2 over
F2. This is an application of the concrete ‘quantum group’ approach to noncom-
mutative geometry developed by many authors but particularly in the bimodule
approach in [5, 6, 1] and elsewhere. This approach works for the most part over
any ﬁeld and also particularly applies to ﬁnite geometries even though our algebras
are commutative (the diﬀerentials are not, as we have explained above). There is a
unique regular m leading to just one inherited diﬀerential calculus on A2 and for it
we ﬁnd exactly 3 translation-invariant metrics η ∈ Ω1 ⊗A2 Ω1, and for each of these
we ﬁnd exactly two Levi-Civita (i.e. torsion free and metric compatible) bimodule
connections. One of these is the obvious ‘zero’ connection on the basic 1-forms and
in each case there is a second ﬂat connection. We present this as an example of
what we would like to call ‘digital geometry’, where we work over F2 = {0, 1} but
retain a geometrical point of view. We believe that this could be of wider interest
if it leads to the transfer of geometric ideas to computer science.

Our results demonstrate that one can usefully carry over geometrical concepts to
a ﬁnite setting over Fp, sometimes even in the extreme case p = 2, with the help
of Hopf algebras and noncommutative diﬀerentials. A more in-depth study of the
noncommutative geometry of the general Ad and the possibility of geometry on the
inverse limit, as well as its more general context, are some speciﬁc topics for future
work.

2. Preliminaries

Let A be an algebra over a ﬁeld k. We think if this as like the coordinate algebra of
an algebraic variety (it need not be) and we require enough diﬀerentiable structure
so as to have an associative ‘diﬀerential graded algebra’ (DGA) of diﬀerential forms,
namely an exterior algebra Ω(A) = ⊕nΩn where Ω0 = A, equipped with a graded-
derivation d : Ωi → Ωi+1 with respect to the product ∧ and obeying d2 = 0. We
are interested in the standard case where Ω1 is spanned by elements of the form
adb for a, b ∈ A and Ω is generated by degrees 0,1 over A. The cohomology H ·
of this complex is sometimes called the noncommutative de Rham complex of the
DGA. It is worth noting that H 0 = kerd ⊆ A is obviously a subalgebra in view of
the Leibniz rule and k.1 ⊆ H 0. We say that the DGA is connected if k.1 = H 0,
this being the case in classical diﬀerential geometry for a connected manifold. In
noncommutative diﬀerential geometry we are often interested in the case when the
calculus in inner, i.e. when there is θ ∈ Ω1 such that [θ, a] = da for all a ∈ A
(and normally also on higher degrees by graded commutator). We refer to [9] for
an introduction. This approach to diﬀerentials is common to most approaches to
noncommutative geometry, including [4], but in our case it is a starting point.

Working with algebraic diﬀerential forms, by ‘metric’ we mean an element η ∈
Ω1 ⊗A Ω1 which is quantum symmetric in the sense ∧(η) = 0 and invertible in the
sense of existence of a bimodule map ( , ) : Ω1 ⊗A Ω1 → A such that (ω, η1)η2 =
ω = η1(η2, ω) for all ω ∈ Ω1. Here η = η1 ⊗ η2 (a sum of such terms understood)
is a notation. One can show[1] that such an η is necessarily central. By a ‘left

4

M.E. BASSETT & S. MAJID

connection’, in our case on Ω1, we mean ∇ : Ω1 → Ω1 ⊗A Ω1 such that ∇(aω) =
a∇ω + da ⊗ ∇ω for all a ∈ A and ω ∈ Ω1. By a ‘bimodule connection’ we mean a
left connection such that in addition ∇(ωa) = (∇ω)a+σ(ω ⊗da) for some bimodule
map σ : Ω1 ⊗A Ω1 → Ω1 ⊗A Ω1. If a left connection admits such a σ then the latter
is unique, hence this is a property of ∇ and not further data. In this case one has
the notion of metric compatible connection ∇η = 0 where ∇ acts on each tensor
factor Ω1 and σ is used to correctly position its output when acting on the second
tensor factor. Finally, the torsion of a connection on Ω1 is T = ∧∇ − d : Ω1 → Ω2
and in noncommutative Riemannian geometry we are ideally interested in ﬁnding
a ‘Levi-Civita’ bimodule connection deﬁned as metric compatible and torsion free.
In the inner case it is shown in [13] that the construction of a bimodule connection
is equivalent to bimodule maps σ as above and α : Ω1 → Ω1 ⊗A Ω1. This is torsion
free if and only if

(2.1)

∧ α = 0, ∧σ = −∧

and metric compatible if and only if

(2.2)

θ ⊗ η + (α ⊗ id)η + σ12(id ⊗ (α − σθ))η = 0.

We will use these equations in Section 5.

Now let A be augmented by a unital algebra hom ǫ : A → k (so ǫ(1) = 1). We
think of ǫ as deﬁning a ‘point’ and the following construction as a step towards its
‘connected component’. If A is a Hopf algebra we take counit as the augmentation
(corresponding in the classical case to the group identity).

Proposition 2.1. Let (A, ǫ) be an augmented algebra, Ω(A) a DGA and H 0(A)
its degree zero cohomology. We deﬁne Ac = A/hH 0(A) ∩ kerǫi with its inherited
diﬀerential calculus. If A is a Hopf algebra and Ω(A) bicovariant then H 0(A) is a
sub-Hopf algebra, Ac is a quotient Hopf algebra and Ω(Ac) is bicovariant.

Proof. Clearly J = H 0(A)∩kerǫ is a subalgebra by the Leibniz rule and we quotient
by the ideal it generates intersected with the ideal A+. More generally, we deﬁne
Ω(Ac) = Ω(A)/hH 0(A) ∩ kerǫi where we quotient by the ideal generated in the
exterior algebra. The map d descends to this quotient since by deﬁnition d(ga) =
(dg)a + gda = gda for all g ∈ J.

For the second part, by assumption there exist left and right coactions ∆L, ∆R
commuting with d. Hence if a ∈ kerd = H 0 it follows that (d ⊗ id)∆a = ∆Lda = 0
and (id ⊗ d)∆a = ∆Rda = 0. Hence ∆a ∈ H 0 ⊗ H 0 and we have a sub-Hopf
algebra. It follows that J = H 0+ is a coideal (here if a ∈ J then ∆a = a(1) ⊗ (a(2) −
1ǫ(a(2))) + a ⊗ 1 ∈ A ⊗ J + J ⊗ A). In this case I = hAi the ideal it generates is
a Hopf ideal and Ac = A/I is a Hopf algebra. Employing the construction above,
the assumed ∆L,R descend to Ac since these are part of Hopf module structures,
eg ∆L(ωa) = (∆Lω)∆a ⊆ AJ ⊗ Ω1 + A ⊗ Ω1J for a ∈ J and ω ∈ Ω1. Hence
Ω1(Ac) is bicovariant. The higher order calculi will be generated by Ω1, Ac with
the inherited relations and since the latter are bicovariant, the higher forms will be
too. Equivalently, Ω(A) is a super-Hopf algebra with ∆L + ∆R in degree 1 and we
can view J as a super-coideal.

It is not clear that the quotient DGA now has H 0(Ac) = k1 but this is a step in the
right direction and could be iterated. However, in our application this construction
will do the job in one step.

The other ingredient in the paper is the construction in [12, 9] whereby irreducible
bicovariant calculi on k[x] correspond to monic irreducible m. The latter deﬁnes a
ﬁeld extension K = k[µ]/(m(µ)) and Ω1(k[x]; m) = K[x] as a left k[x]-module in
the obvious way and

v · f (x) = f (x + µ)v,

df = (f (x + µ) − f (x))µ−1,

∀f ∈ k[x], v ∈ K

in terms of the algebra K[x] and provided µ ∈ K ∗; this is understood as the
classical calculus when µ = 0. The non-classical case is inner with θ = µ−1. The
entire exterior algebra is of the form Ω = Λ[x] where Λ = Λ(K) is the usual exterior
algebra of K as a vector space over k and in the inner case has d = [θ, } given
by graded-commutator. Note that if k ⊆ K is a ﬁeld extension and µ ∈ K then
there is a possibly non-surjective translation-invariant calculus Ω1
µ,K(k[x]) = K[x]
as a left k[x]-module and the description above, which is an actual calculus if K is
generated by k, µ. Conversely, every translation-invariant calculus on k[x] is of this
form with K given by adjoining µ subject to a relation m(µ) = 0. The calculus
depends on µ and hence on m.

Lemma 2.2. Suppose that H 0(k[x]; m) 6= k.1 and let g ∈ H 0 have minimal positive
degree. Then H 0(k[x]; m) = k[g].

Proof. Let f ∈ H 0 and let f = f1g+r1 where deg r1 < deg g. Then dr1 +(df1)g = 0
as dg = 0. Viewing this in the ring K[x] we have the ﬁrst term degree < deg g and
the 2nd term degree ≥ deg g, hence both terms vanish and since g had minimal
degree among non-constants in H 0 we conclude that r1 is a constant, df1 = 0.
Iterating, we conclude that f is a polynomial in g.
(cid:3)

3. Structure of H 0(Fp[x]; m)

We consider A = Fp[x] and calculi deﬁned by monic irreducible m of degree d and
let P denote the linear subspace of Fp[x] involving only power-p exponents (we will
explain later that P is the set of primitive elements of A as a Hopf algebra). If
f ∈ P then f is additive and hence, when µ 6= 0,

df = f (µ)µ−1 ∈ Fpd ,

[v, f ] = f (µ)v,

∀v ∈ Fpd

where Fpd ⊂ Fpd [x] is the subspace of left-invariant 1-form in the calculus. Thus
f ∈ H 0 ∩ P are characterised by f (µ) = 0, while general f ∈ H 0 are characterised
by f (x + µ) = f (x) which implies f (µ) = f (0) or f (µ) = 0 for f ∈ H 0 ∩ kerǫ as a
necessary condition.

The case d = 1 is easy enough to analyse in full detail and includes the case where
µ = 0. Here monic irreducibles have the form m(x) = x − µ, for some µ ∈ Fp. This
gives a 1-dimensional calculus and of course no actual extension of the ﬁeld. The
ﬁeld extension deﬁned by m would have generator set equal to µ, which is why we
have denoted this as the constant to ﬁt with our previous notation. The case µ = 0
also leads to a calculus which we understand as the classical one. We let

g1(x) = xp − x = x(xp−1 − 1) = x(x − 1)(x − 2) · · · (x − (p − 1)) ∈ P.

Proposition 3.1. For d = 1, H 0(Fp[x]; m) =(Fp[xp]

Fp[g1]

if µ = 0
if µ 6= 0

.

Proof. If µ = 0 we have the classical calculus where dxm = mxm−1dx = 0 when
m = p, and clearly any non-constant polynomial of lower degree will not be in
the kernel by looking at its top degree. We then use Lemma 2.2. When µ 6= 0
we manifestly have g1(x + µ) = g1(x) (from the form of g1) and we show that
its degree p is the minimal degree of non-constant elements of H 0. Thus, let f
be monic of degree t < p so f = xt + cxt−1 + · · ·
for some c ∈ Fp. We have
f (x + µ) = xt + µtxt−1 + cxt−1 + · · · where we indicate further terms of degree < t.
For this to equal f we need µt = 0 mod p, which requires t = 0 as t < p. Hence
f = 1. We then use Lemma 2.2.
(cid:3)

More generally, we let

calculus and associated Fpd = Fp[µ]/(m).

− x ∈ P.

gn(x) = xpn

Lemma 3.2. For m of degree d other than m = x (or µ = 0) already covered, we
have H 0(Fp[x]; m) ⊇ Fp[gd] and gi /∈ H 0(Fp[x]; m) for i = 1, 2, · · · , d − 1.

Proof. Clearly m is a factor of gd so gd(µ) = 0. This is also immediate from µpd−1 =
1 in Fpd . Hence excluding the special case µ = 0, we have gd ∈ H 0(Fp[x]; m)
and hence (by the Leibniz rule) that all polynomials of it are contained in the
cohomology. If gi(µ) = 0 for some i < d then µ is a zero of some irreducible monic
of degree dividing i and hence of degree < d. This would have to be divisible by
m, which is a contradiction. Hence dgi 6= 0 for 1 ≤ i < d.
(cid:3)

We say that m of degree d is regular if H 0(Fp[x]; m) = Fp[gd]. We have seen that
this happens for d = 1 precisely when µ 6= 0. We will also be interested in

Lemma 3.3. If hd(µ) = 0 then m of degree d is not regular, and H 0(Fp[x]; m) ⊇
Fp[hd] when d > 1.

Proof. If d = 1 and h1(µ) = 0 then µ = 0 and we know that this case is not regular
by the above. If d > 1 and hd(µ) = 0 then hd ∈ H 0 by the above remarks and
hence so is the subalgebra Fp[h1] by the Leibniz rule. We also have

(3.3)
so that Fp[gd] ( Fp[hd] and this is strict as hd has lower degree and clearly can’t be
written as a polynomial in gd. Hence if hd(µ) = 0 then m cannot be regular.

Proof. d = 1 was already covered so we ﬁx d ≥ 2 and prove the assertion for
hd(µ) 6= 0 by induction. Thus, suppose for some n in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ d that if f
is of degree < pn−1 and f (x + µ) − f (x) = cµpi
for some constant c ∈ Fp and some
i = 1, · · · , d − 1 then f (x) = f (0) and c = 0. We note that if f has degree < p
and obeys the condition stated then the argument in the proof of Proposition 3.1
is unaﬀected when we look at powers of x > 1 and similarly allows us to conclude
that f (x) = f (0) + cµpi−1x. We write this as (f (x) − f (0))µ = cµpi
x and apply the
Trace to both sides, so (f (x) − f (0) − cx)hd(µ) = 0 (using invariance of the Trace
under the Frobenius) and hence f (x) = f (0) + cx. Putting in this information,
we have gicx = 0 and hence c = 0 using the second part of Lemma 3.1. Thus the
hypothesis holds for f of degree < p.

Now consider f of degree < pn and write this as f = Pp−1

have degree < pn−1. We also write

k=0 xpn−1kfk(x) where fk

Now suppose that f (x+µ) = f (x)+cµpi
x for some c and some i < d, i.e. Ap−1(x) =
cµpi
. We prove by induction that this implies that c = 0 and f is constant. Indeed,
suppose Am(x) = cµpi
. From the second expression for Am(x), only the ﬁrst term
has powers of degree ≥ pn−1m and Am(x) = cµpi
tells us that fm(x+µ)−fm(x) = 0
and hence by our inductive assumption, fm(x) = fm(0) is a constant. Putting in
this information gives us

We now pick oﬀ the ≥ pn−1(m − 1) degrees to ﬁnd

fm−1(x + µ) − fm−1(x) + mµpn−1

fm(0) = 0

and our induction hypothesis allows us to conclude that fm(0) = 0 and hence that
Am−1(x) = cµpi
. Starting at m = p − 1 we now iterate this argument to conclude
that fp−1 = 0, · · · , f1 = 0 and A0(x) = cµpi
, and hence that f = f0 ∈ H 0 has
degree < pn−1. We then conclude by our overall induction hypothesis that f is a
constant and c = 0. Proceeding inductively, we have proven our hypothesis for all
f of degree < pd.

In particular, we apply this result with c = 0 to conclude that H 0 contains no
nonconstant elements of degree < pd. Hence the degree pd of gd is minimal among
nonconstants in H 0. We then use Lemma 2.2. Lemma 3.3 provides the other
direction when hd(µ) = 0.

Corollary 3.5. hd(µ) 6= 0 iﬀ m of degree d has a nonzero coeﬃcient in degree
d − 1. Moreover, there are

such m, where µM¨ob is the M¨obius function.

Proof. Here h1(µ) = Trace(µ) is the trace for Fp[µ]/(m) → Fp and it is a fact from
number theory[7] that Trace(µ) = −md−1 where m(x) = xd + md−1xd−1 + · · · + m0
is the minimal polynomial of µ, which is our case by construction. Hence h1(µ) 6= 0
if and only md−1 6= 0. Next, the number of monic irreducibles in Fp[x] with a ﬁxed
non-zero value of this coeﬃcient was found by Carlitz[2] and more recently in the
form we use in [15]. As we required only a non-zero value, we multiply this by the
p − 1 possible values to give the expression stated.
(cid:3)

This gives an easy criterion to tell if a given m is regular. The number of such
should be compared with Gauss’ formula for the number Nd of all irreducible m
of degree d, Nd = 1
k . Thus a good fraction of m are regular. The
formula gives p − 1 regular m as it should for d = 1 by Proposition 3.1.

Also note that the factorisation (3.3) means that either hd(µ) = 0 (the non-regular
case) or m divides (hd − 1)(1 + hd + · · · hp−2
) (the regular case) according to our
theorem. Meanwhile, Lemma 3.3 suggests a similar result for the cohomology for
the ﬂip side when hd(µ) = 0:

Conjecture 3.6. m of degree d > 1 has H 0(Fp[x]; m) = Fp[hd] if and only if
hd(µ) = 0.

It is not clear that this can be proven by similar methods to those of our main
theorem. We also note in passing that as well as the Trace there is a norm map
N : Fpd → Fp deﬁned as

N (x) = xxp · · · xpd−1

and N (µ) = (−1)dm0 6= 0 as m is irreducible. Hence N /∈ H 0(Fp[x]; m).

100) we have for p = 2 and d ≤ 4,

(1) H 0(F2[x]; µ2 + µ + 1) = F2[x4 + x] = F2[g2]
(2) H 0(F2[x]; µ3 + µ2 + 1) = F2[x8 + x] = F2[g3]
(3) H 0(F2[x]; µ3 + µ + 1) = F2[x4 + x2 + x] = F2[h3]
(4) H 0(F2[x]; µ4 + µ3 + µ2 + µ + 1) = F2[x16 + x] = F2[g4]
(5) H 0(F2[x]; µ4 + µ3 + 1) = F2[x16 + x] = F2[g4]
(6) H 0(F2[x]; µ4 + µ + 1) = F2[x8 + x4 + x2 + x] = F2[h4]

One can also see here that the regular m are precisely the factors of degree d in
hd + 1, as per the general theory when p = 2. We also see the right number of
regular ones as per the formula.

4. The Hopf algebras Ad

Motivated by the above cohomology computations, for each d ∈ N and each regular
m of degree d we deﬁne

Ad := Fp[x]/(gd) = Fp[x]/(xpd

− x), Ω(Ad; m) = Ω(Fp[x]; m)/hgdi

d | m > 0} = Fp[gd]+ where the + denotes functions
Here J = H 0 ∩ kerǫ = span{gm
with no constant term. Hence Fp[x]J = (gd) is the ideal that we quotient out by
to deﬁne Ad.

We think of the algebra Ad as deﬁning a ‘space’ at a topological level in some sense,
and in this regard we note that Ad as deﬁned depends only on the degree of the
ﬁeld extension. We think of m as adding to this data a diﬀerentiable structure
inherited from the one on Fp[x].

Corollary 4.1. H 0(Ad; m) = Fp1 for the inherited diﬀerential structure from any
regular monic irreducible m of degree d.

Proof. This is immediate from Theorem 3.4 and we use the notations there. Sup-
pose that f (x + µ) − f (x) ∈ (gd) in Fpd [x], i.e. products of gd with polynomi-
In Fp[x] we let f = hgd + r
als that include powers of µ in their coeﬃcients.
where either r = 0 (so f = 0 in Ad) or the degree of r is less than pd. Then
h(x + µ)gd(x + µ) + r(x + µ) − h(x)gd(x) − r(x) = (h(x + µ) − h(x))gd(x) + r(x +
µ) − r(x) ∈ (gd) since gd(x + µ) = gd(x) as gd is additive and gd(µ) = 0. Hence
r(x + µ) − r(x) ∈ (gd). But since every nonzero element of (gd) has degree ≥ pd we
conclude that r(x + µ) − r(x) = 0 and hence by Theorem 3.4 that r is a constant,
hence f is a multiple of the identity in Ad. .
(cid:3)

This means that we achieved our goal of having ﬁnite-dimensional quotients of Fp[x]
equipped now with (a moduli space of) connected diﬀerential calculi. We now turn
to the algebraic structure of the Ad.

Corollary 4.2. Ad is a pd-dimensional Hopf algebra and Ω(Ad) is bicovariant.
Moreover, the primitive elements of Ad are spanned by the set {xpi

: 0 ≤ i < d}

Proof. As x is primitive, we have

∆xn =

n

Xk=0(cid:18)n

k(cid:19)xk ⊗ xn−k

corresponding digit of n. Hence xn is primitive if n = pi for some i. Conversely,

By Lucas’ theorem, (cid:0)n
if n is not a power of p, then there exist some k 6= 0, n for which (cid:0)n

k(cid:1) = 0 mod p iﬀ a base p digit of k is greater than the
k(cid:1) 6= 0 mod

p, and so xn is not primitive. It then follows easily that the primitive elements of
Fp[x] are precisely spanned by the p-power exponents. In particular, gd is primitive
and hence Ad is a Hopf algebra. Its primitives have the same form but restricted
to degree < pd. Here Fp[gd] is a Hopf algebra with gd primitive and in this way a
sub-Hopf algebra of Fp[x] as per the general theory in Section 2. The latter also
implies bicovariance.
(cid:3)

Next, Ad carries the Frobenius automorphism F (x) = xp and hence always contains
a Frobenius-ﬁxed subalgebra Bd = AF
d every element equals its p-power. For p = 2
this means that Bd is a Boolean subalgebra.

Proposition 4.3. dim Bd = 1

Proof. The Frobenius automorphism has order d and permutes the set {1, x, x2, . . . , xpd−1}.
Write this permutation in its decomposition as cycles σ1, . . . σb. When a polynomial
f is the sum of monomials from an orbit of a σi it is ﬁxed by the endomorphism.
The set of such polynomials (with all coeﬃcients 1) is linearly independent and
generates Bd. Now let Cs = {spj mod pd − 1 : 0 ≤ j ≤ d − 1} be the cyclotomic
coset of p modulo pd − 1 containing s. Note that each Cs and Cr are either disjoint
or equal. Let C ⊂ Z/(pd − 1)Z be such that

Cs = Z/(pd − 1)Z

[s∈C

and each pair Cs and Cr are disjoint for s, r ∈ C, s 6= r. C is in bijection with the
set of orbits of the permutation cycles deﬁne above, excluded the singleton orbit
{xpd−1}, which comes from the additional factor of x in the polynomial modulus:
let s ∈ C, if xs ∈ orbσi, then orbσi = {xspj
Let α ∈ Fpd be a generator for the multiplicative group F×
that

− x.

Also note that gi has a factor gj whenever j divides i since it includes all irreducibles
of degree that divide j. Hence we have a directed system of Hopf algebras

{Aj → Ai | i divides j}

ordered by divisibility. The full system will be studied elsewhere while here we
focus on the canonical Hopf algebra maps π : Ad → A1, since 1 divides every
integer. To ﬁnd the kernel of this map we consider the canonical automorphism of
the algebra Ad given by the order p periodicity map ψ(x) = x + 1. Here gi(x + 1) =
(x + 1)pi
− (x + 1) = gi(x) working over Fp, so these give invariant elements of Ad
for i = 1, · · · , d − 1. We will be interested in the invariant subalgebra Cd = Aψ
d of
Ad.

Proposition 4.4. Cd = Fp[g1]/(hd(g1)) for all d ∈ N is a Hopf algebra of dimen-
sion pd−1 and

is an extension of Hopf algebras.

Cd ֒→ Ad ։ A1

Proof. We start with Fp[x]ψ = Fp[g1]. This is a well-known fact from Artin-Schreier
theory but for completeness we include an elementary proof from [14]. If f (x + 1) =
f (x) and f has degree < p then the proof of Proposition 3.1 with µ = 1 applies

and allows us to conclude that f (x) is a constant. More generally let f (x) =
g1h(x)+ r(x) where r has degree < p. Then g1(h(x+ 1)− h(x)) = −(r(x+ 1)− r(x))
which by degrees requires both h and r to be invariant. Thus r is a constant and h is
an invariant of lower degree, leading to the result. Also clearly, the {gi
i} are linearly
independent over Fp (by looking at the top degree of a polynomial relation). Also
in Fp[x] we have hi(g1) = g1 +gp
=
xp − x + xp2
= gi on cancellation. In particular, hd(g1) = gd,
and if a polynomial in g1 of degree < pd−1 is divisible by gd then, by degrees,
it must separately vanish. Hence polynomials in g1 up to degree < pd−1 viewed
in Ad form a pd−1-dimensional subalgebra. Finally, if f ∈ Fp[x] has degree < pd
and f (x + 1) − f (x) is divisible by gd then by degrees is must separately vanish,
hence Cd = Fp[g1]/(gd) = Fp[g1]/(hd(g1)). This inclusion i : Cd ֒→ Ad makes Cd
a sub-Hopf algebra as g1 is primitive. The Hopf algebra map π : Ad → A1 where
we quotient by (g1) clearly obeys π ◦ i = 1ǫ since it is 1 on 1 ∈ Cd and vanishes on
C+
d . It follows from general arguments since the Hopf algebras involved are ﬁnite
dimensional, see [16, Cor 3.2.2], that this gives an exact sequence of Hopf algebras
in the technical (cleft) sense provided only that the dimensions match. This is our
case as we have seen that dim(A1) dim(Cd) = dim(Ad).
(cid:3)

It follows from the theory of such extensions of Hopf algebras that Ad is a cocycle
bicrossproduct of Cd and A1[10]. We will give this explicitly and in fact the exten-
sion result applies for Fp[x] as well, not only the ﬁnite-dimensional quotients. We

hence is a constant. Evaluating at zero, only δ0(0) = −(p − 1)! = 1 is non-zero, we
have

The following is well-known in the context of Mahler’s theorem or Artin-Schreier
theory but we include a short proof as a model for the proof of the theorem:

δi = 1.

Lemma 4.5. A1 ∼= Fp(Z/pZ) the Hopf algebra of functions on the ﬁnite group
Z/pZ.

Proof. We identify the Kronecker delta-function at i ∈ Z/pZ with δi ∈ A1 i.e.
viewed mod g1. Clearly in A1 we have δi(x − i) = 0 and hence δiδj = 0 in A1 for

i 6= j, so that δiδi = δi in A1 from P δi = 1. Hence this is an isomorphism of

algebras. For the coproduct we note that the image of the coproduct of Fp[x] has
the property of invariance under ψ ⊗ψ−1 acting in the two factors (this clear for ∆x
and therefore applies on any polynomial). Since {δi} by the above relations form a
ij ∈ Fp. Then invariance implies
0,i+j. However, ǫ(δi) = δi,0 and the counity axiom then implies that

d ≥ 1.

Proof. In view of Lemma 4.5, the action of Z/pZ via ψ on Fp[x] becomes a right

coaction ∆Rf = P ψi(f ) ⊗ δi of A1. Clearly ∆R(δi) = Pj δi−j ⊗ δj viewed in

Fp[x] ⊗ A1. Then j : A1 → Fp[x] sending j(δi) = δi is a right comodule map. It is
also convolution-invertible with j−1(δj) = δ−j as

This is because the sum is ψ-invariant hence by degrees is at most linear in g1. The

for all i, j 6= 0. Using that Pp−1

is no g1 term. Hence we have a cleft extension and Fp[x] ∼= Fp[g1] ⊗χ A1 for some

coeﬃcient and hence is at most constant plus linear in g1. We then use our previous

FINITE NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRIES RELATED TO Fp[x]

properties to match the coeﬃcient of x, to give the form stated. From the theory
of extensions, see [10], we will be able to recover the product of Fp[x] from

(c ⊗ δi)(c′ ⊗ δj) = cc′Xk

Clearly, these results are not changed modulo gd as higher powers of g1 were not
involved. Hence Ad = Cd ⊗χ A1 also by identifying the δ-functions.
(cid:3)

The same form of result applies for p = 2 but the formulae are diﬀerent due to
failure of the power-sum identities in this case; we cover this case later. Such cleft
extensions may also be regarded as trivial quantum principal bundles or Hopf-
Galois extensions of a certain trivial type, which are indeed classiﬁed by cocycles as
explained in detail in [11]. Indeed, the above implies that they are of the quantum
homogeneous space type with ∆R = (id ⊗ π)∆.

5. Noncommutative geometry of A1 and A2

In this section we study A1, A2 in more detail, focussing on their noncommutative
diﬀerential geometry and Fourier theory in the case of A1. There are no signiﬁcant
proofs in this section but we rather we develop a geometric point of view on our
ﬁnite-dimensional algebras.

5.1. Geometry and Fourier transform on Fp(Z/pZ). Here we focus on

A1 = Fp[x]/(xp − x).

This is isomorphic to Fp
p as a ring, so the functions on p points, and indeed we
have already remarked in Lemma 4.5 that it is isomorphic to Fp(Z/pZ) where the
Kronecker delta-functions on the latter are mapped to the δi(x) for i = 0, · · · , p − 1.

14

M.E. BASSETT & S. MAJID

From the projector relations among the δi in A1 and the evaluations δi(j) = δi,j
which follow from the deﬁnition of δi(x), it is easy to see that

(5.1)

δi(x)f (x) = f (i)δi(x),

∀f (x) ∈ A1.

Thus, if f (x) ∈ A1 then the values f (i) for i ∈ Z/pZ provide the corresponding

function on the group while conversely f (x) = Pi δi(x)f (i). We also recall that

ﬁnite-dimensional Hopf algebras have unique translation-invariant integration up
to normalisation. In our case we have up to normalisation

(5.2)

Z xn =(1 n = p − 1

else

0

,

which is equivalent via the isomorphism to R f = Pp−1
From this or from the coeﬃcient of xp−1 in δi being 1, we clearly have R δi(x) = 1.

Next, the dual Hopf algebra to Fp(Z/pZ) is the group Hopf algebra of Z/pZ,

i=0 f (i) for f ∈ Fp(Z/pZ).

H1 = FpZ/pZ = Fp[t]/(tp − 1), ∆t = t ⊗ t

and has the unique normalised translation-invariant integral

We can view this Hopf algebra as dual to A1 via the Hopf algebra duality pairing

(5.4)

A1 ⊗ H1 → Fp,

hf (x), tj i = f (j),

∀f (x) ∈ A1.

As our Hopf algebras are ﬁnite-dimensional, there is necessarily a canonical coeval-
uation which we denote exp ∈ H1 ⊗ A1. We recall that for any ﬁnite dimensional
Hopf algebra and speciﬁed integral on it, we have a Fourier transform F : A1 → H1
given by integration against one factor of exp, see [10] for an exposition. In our
i=0 ti ⊗ δi(x) leading to the canonical

case it is immediate from (5.4) that exp =Pp−1

Note that (R ⊗R ) exp = 1 so this is the ‘volume’ (analogous to 2π) in the general

Fourier theory[10]. This completes our review of the standard Fourier theory on
Z/pZ.

Next, in the same way as we have described the functions on the ﬁnite group as a
quotient of the aﬃne line Fp[x], namely A1, we can do the adjoint thing on the dual
side. Thus, FpZ/pZ already looks like an algebraic group with group-like generator
t but we can go further and write this as like the enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra
with inﬁnitesimal generator L, say.

i=0 (Li)p/i! = 1. More generally it follows from Lp = 0 that

Hence the algebra map Fp[L]/(Lp) → H1 sending L to ln(t) is injective (by applying
the algebra map going the other way that sends t to eL) and hence by dimensions
an isomorphism. Next, given L, for t to be group-like we need

∆L = ln(eL ⊗ eL),

ǫL = 0

With this coalgebra, the two Hopf algebras are isomorphic. We then convert over
the integral as stated.

we took L primitive then we would again have a Hopf algebra on Fp[L]/(Lp) but now
dually paired with Fp[x]/(xp). One could view this pair as a kind of linearisation
of our Hopf algebras, no longer isomorphic to group algebras and group function
algebras respectively. Compared to these, A1 has a modiﬁed algebra relation and
dually H1 has a modiﬁed coproduct.

We now turn to diﬀerentials. We recall that the regular d = 1 monics are of the
form m = x − µ for µ ∈ F∗
p and necessarily descend to A1. The classical calculus
on Fp[x] given by µ = 0, aside from not being regular, implies dx = dxp = 0 and
hence gives the zero calculus on A1; we exclude it for this reason also.

Proposition 5.3. For any µ ∈ F∗
i > 1 and Ω1 = A1dx with relations

p, the inherited calculus Ω(A1) has Ωi = 0 for

Moreover, H 0(A1) = Fp, H 1(A1) = Fp, spanned by 1 and xp−1dx respectively.

[dx, f ] = µdf

Proof. The inherited calculus has the form stated, with df = (∂f )dx where

∂f =

f (x + µ) − f (x)

µ

,

∀f ∈ A1.

We already know H 0 from Corollary 4.1 but we can also see this directly. If ∂f = 0
then f (x + µ) = f (x). But nµ = λ mod p has a solution n for all λ so by iteration
f (x + λ) = f (x) for all λ. By (5.1), f (x) is determined by its values and we see that
these are constant, hence f is a multiple of 1. For H 1, all 1-forms are closed and if
f dx = dh for some h(x) then f = ∂h = (h(x + µ) − h(x))/µ. Clearly this cannot
happen for f of degree p − 1 since h would need degree p which is not possible.
For smaller degree one can iteratively solve to ﬁnd h by calculations that are the
same as for the trivial 1st cohomology of Fp[x] with its 1-dimensional calculi. The
calculus is manifestly inner with θ = µ−1dx.
(cid:3)

Note that calculi on ﬁnite sets correspond to directed graphs and the above calculi
correspond to the Cayley graph on Z/pZ generated by singleton sets {µ} ⊂ Z/pZ.
The directed graph here has edges of the form i
−→i + µ corresponding to a ﬁnite
diﬀerence by a single step size µ on Z/pZ. It is easy to see from (5.5) by a change
of variables (shifting by µ) in F that

which is the fundamental identity of Fourier theory from a practical point of view
(that diﬀerentiation becomes multiplication by an element of the dual space coor-
dinate algebra).

One can also ask on the dual side about the calculus on H1 = Fp[t]/htp −1i. Usually
in the abelian case the problem reverts to calculi on the dual group but that is not
possible in our case where the order of the group is the characteristic. However,
it remains in any characteristic that translation invariant calculi on group algebras
are classiﬁed by group 1-cocycles. In our case there is a natural choice in which the
values of the cocycle are in Fp with trivial group action. In that case a group cocycle
means a group homomorphism from Z/pZ to itself, which since p is prime can only
be trivial or the identity. We therefore have a unique 1-dimensional calculus from
this point of view, namely

Ω1(H1) = H1v,

v = t−1dt,

dti = it v,

[dt, t] = 0

and Ω2 = 0. We see that this is the classical calculus on the algebraic circle
Fp[t, t−1] descended to H1. Writing df (t) = (∂f )(t)v, we have ∂tm = mtm, the
degree operator. From (5.5) one easily ﬁnds

F −1∂ = xF −1

so that diﬀerentiation on H1 again becomes multiplication in A1 under Fourier
transform. In terms of L, we have

The calculus here descends from the classical calculus on Fp[L] but v and not dL is
the basic translation-invariant diﬀerential form, because this property depends on
the coproduct on L and this was modiﬁed from the additive one. Consequently, we
have

is Fp
as ring, so we do not have functions on a ﬁnite group. We focus
on p = 2. The Hopf algebra Fourier theory can be computed as for A1 but is not
particularly illuminating, while the geometry is now more interesting.

First, we look at the algebraic structure. The ﬁxed subalgebra B2 then has dimen-
sion 3 according to Proposition 4.3, so this is the Boolean algebra on 3 elements.

Proposition 5.4. A2 is reduced and every element obeys a4 = a for all a ∈ A2.
Moreover, A2 ∼= F2x ⊕ B2 as a vector space and contains B2 as a subalgebra. The
Hopf algebra structure of A2 in this form is

ei = 1,

x2 = x + e1,

e1x = e2 + x,

e2x = e2,

e3x = 0

eiej = eiδij, Xi

ǫx = ǫe1 = ǫe2 = 0,

∆e2 = e2 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ e2+ e1 ⊗ x + x ⊗ e1, ∆e3 = 1 ⊗ 1 + e3 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ e3+ e1 ⊗ x + x ⊗ e1

ǫe3 = 1, ∆x = x ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ x, ∆e1 = e1 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ e1

18

M.E. BASSETT & S. MAJID

Proof. By writing a = α + βx + γx2 + δx3 we see that a2 = α + βx2 + γx + δx3
and a4 = a. This is also clear from the ring structure. The coeﬃcients here are 0, 1
and in this case an = 0 is not possible for any n > 0 unless a = 0. The boolean
elements (meaning a2 = a) are of the form α + β(x + x2) + δx3 and these form a
subalgebra. Here 1, e1 = x2 + x, e3 = x3 + 1 obey e1e3 = 0 so with e2 = 1 − e1 − e3
are a complete set of idempotents for this subalgebra. So A2 ∼= F2.x ⊕ B2. We
easily work out the Hopf algebra structure as stated. The antipode is the identity
map.
(cid:3)

We also know from Proposition 4.4 that A2 is a cocycle extension, as is F2[x], but
the formulae were not covered before. Here

and F2[x]ψ = F2[g1] where g1 = x2 + x.

δ0(x) = 1 + x,

δ1(x) = x

Corollary 5.5. F2[x] = F2[g1] ⊗χ A1 where χ(δi ⊗ δj) = δi,0δj,0 + g1 so that

δ2
0 = δ0 + g1,

δ2
1 = δ1 + g1,

δ0δ1 = g1

hold in F2[x]. Here g1 is primitive while A1 appears as a subcoalgebra via identiﬁ-
cation of δ-functions. Moreover, A2 ∼= A1 ⊗χ A1.

Proof. Here it is easier to compute the delta-function products in F2[x] giving
the result stated and from which one may readily deduce the cocycle. The new
ingredient is that C2 = F2[g1]/(g2
(cid:3)

1 + g1) ∼= A1.

This says equivalently that A2 is a cocycle extension F2(Z/2Z) ⊗χ F2(Z2/2Z). The
dual Hopf algebra is most easily computed from this. We now turn to the inherited
structure of Ω(A2) and its geometry.

Proposition 5.6. The quotient Ω(A2) is 2-dimensional in degree 1 with basis dx, µ
and relations

[dx, x] = µ,

[µ, x] = dx + µ

Moreover, the calculus is bicovariant, inner with θ = dx + µ and connected with
Poincare duality in the sense

H 0(A2) = F2, H 1(A2) = F2

2, H 2(A2) = F2.

These are spanned by 1, {xdx, µx2} and x3dx ∧ µ respectively.

Proof. We work in the F4[x] description but we write dx = 1 ∈ F4[x] to avoid
confusion with 1 ∈ A2. Thus dx.x = (x + µ) = x.1 + µ = dx + µ. Similarly,
µx = (x + µ)µ = xµ + (1 + µ) = dx + (x + 1)µ as stated. These are the same basis
and relations as for F2[x], just adopted for our quotent algebra. Note also that
the calculus necessarily remains inner with θ = µ−1 = dx + µ ∈ Ω1. It necessarily
remains bicovariant, but this can also be veriﬁed directly. If we let dn denote the
restriction of the derivative to n-th component of the graded exterior algebra and
write d0f = ∂1f dx + ∂2f µ for f ∈ A, then d1(f1dx + f2µ) = (∂1f2 − ∂2f1)dx ∧ µ
for f1dx + f2µ ∈ Ω1. We already know H 0 by Corollary 4.1 but it is also easy
to verify directly. Brute-force calculation shows that Im(d0) is spanned over F2
by {dx, µ, x2dx + xµ}, ker(d1) is spanned by {dx, µ, xdx, x2dx + xµ, x2µ}, and
ﬁnally that Im(d1) is spanned by {1, x, x2}dx ∧ µ. The dimensions and bases of the

FINITE NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRIES RELATED TO Fp[x]

cohomologies follow. Note that over F2 the exterior algebra is both commutative
and anticommutative and symmetric combinations of the basic 1-forms are in the
kernel of ∧.
(cid:3)

By contrast, these features do not hold for the universal calculus on A2 which is
necessarily acyclic and hence cannot obey Poincar´e duality, and has weaker relations

[dx, x] = µ,

[µ, x] = θ,

[θ, x] = dx

where θ is an independent 1-form. It is clear that Ω(A2) in Proposition 5.6 is the
quotient of this by the further relation θ = dx + µ which respects the coaction and
therefore remains bicovariant. Finally, we turn to the Riemannian geometry of this
inherited 2-dimensional calculus. Note that in noncommutative geometry a metric,
when it exists, need not admit a ‘Levi-Civita’ connection (in the sense of torsion
free and metric compatible) and if it does, the connection need not be unique. In
the Hopf algebra case it is natural to consider left-invariant metrics, i.e. ones that
are constant in the basic 1-forms, in our case dx, µ.

Proposition 5.7. Central η ∈ Ω1 ⊗A2 Ω1 with ∧(η) = 0 have the form

η = α(µ ⊗ µ + θ ⊗ θ) + β(dx ⊗ dx + θ ⊗ θ), α, β ∈ A2.

∇dx = ∇µ = 0, σ = ﬂip on the generators is a torsion free metric compatible
bimodule connection if α, β ∈ F2. Each of the three nonzero metrics in this case
has a second torsion free metric compatible bimodule connection:

(i)

η = dx ⊗ dx + µ ⊗ µ; ∇dx = ∇µ = θ ⊗ θ

σ(dx ⊗ dx) = µ ⊗ µ,
σ(dx ⊗ µ) = dx ⊗ µ,

σ(µ ⊗ µ) = dx ⊗ dx
σ(µ ⊗ dx) = µ ⊗ dx

(ii)

η = dx ⊗ dx + θ ⊗ θ; ∇dx = dx ⊗ µ + µ ⊗ dx, ∇µ = µ ⊗ µ

σ(dx ⊗ dx) = θ ⊗ θ,

σ(µ ⊗ µ) = µ ⊗ µ

σ(dx ⊗ µ) = µ ⊗ θ,

σ(µ ⊗ dx) = θ ⊗ µ

(iii)

η = µ ⊗ µ + θ ⊗ θ; ∇dx = dx ⊗ dx, ∇µ = dx ⊗ µ + µ ⊗ dx

σ(dx ⊗ dx) = dx ⊗ dx,

σ(µ ⊗ µ) = θ ⊗ θ

σ(dx ⊗ µ) = θ ⊗ dx,

σ(µ ⊗ dx) = dx ⊗ θ

and all four connections are ﬂat.

Proof. We let f = dx ⊗ µ + µ ⊗ dx and h = dx ⊗ dx + µ ⊗ µ and compute

[dx ⊗ dx, x] = f = [µ ⊗ µ, x],

[dx ⊗ µ, x] = dx ⊗ µ + h,

[µ ⊗ dx, x] = µ ⊗ dx + h

from which it follows that central combinations must be of the form

η = αdx ⊗ dx + βµ ⊗ µ + (α + β)f

which can also be written as stated.

Next, we look for bimodule connections. By [13], since the calculus is inner, these
take the form ∇ω = θ ⊗ ω − σ(ω ⊗ θ) + αω for bimodule maps σ, α and for this to
have zero torsion, we need (2.1). Thus, if we suppose

α(dx) = adx ⊗ dx + bθ ⊗ θ + cf

20

then

M.E. BASSETT & S. MAJID

α(µ) = α([dx, x]) = [α(dx), x] = (a + b + c)f

using [f, x] = f and the above. Then

adx ⊗ dx + bµ ⊗ µ + (a + b)f = α(dx + µ) = α([µ, x]) = [α(µ), x] = (a + b + c)f

requires a, b, c = 0. Hence there are no non-zero module maps α with the required
symmetry. We therefore drop the bimodule map α henceforth (so there is no conﬂict
with our other notation α, β as the metric parameters). Similarly, let

σ(dx ⊗ dx) = adx ⊗ dx + bµ ⊗ µ + cf

σ(µ ⊗ µ) = Adx ⊗ dx + Bµ ⊗ µ + Cf

σ(dx ⊗ µ) = a′dx ⊗ dx + b′µ ⊗ µ + c′f + µ ⊗ dx

as dictated by ∧σ = −∧. Then

σ(f ) = σ([dx ⊗ dx, x]) = [σ(dx ⊗ dx), x] = (a + b + c)f = (A + B + C)f

(by f = [µ ⊗ µ, x] for the second version) so that

a + b + c = A + B + C.

Similarly σ([dx ⊗ µ, x]) = [σ(dx ⊗ µ), x] gives us two further equations

a′ = 1 + a + A,

b′ = 1 + b + B

This leaves us parameters a, b, c, A, B, c′ for σ with the required symmetry. Then
writing σθ = σ( , θ) we have

σθ(dx) = (1 + A)dx ⊗ dx + (1 + B)µ ⊗ µ + (c + c′)f + µ ⊗ dx,
σθ(µ) = (1 + a)dx ⊗ dx + (1 + b)µ ⊗ µ + (A + B + c′)f + µ ⊗ dx

For simplicity we assume that all our functions are constants. Then

∇dx = Adx ⊗ dx + (1 + B)µ ⊗ µ + (c + c′)f,

∇µ = (1 + a)dx ⊗ dx + bµ ⊗ µ + (1 + A + B + c′)f

and
(id ⊗ σθ)η = dx⊗2 ((α(a + A) + β(1 + a))dx + (α(A + B + c) + β(A + B + c′))µ)

+ µ⊗2 ((α(1 + c + c′) + β(A + B + c))dx + (α(1 + B) + β(b + B))µ)
+ dx ⊗ µ ((α(A + B + c) + β(1 + A + B + c′))dx + (α(b + B) + β(1 + b))µ)
+ µ ⊗ dx ((α(1 + A) + β(a + A))dx + ((α(c + c′) + β(A + B + c))µ)

Applying σ⊗id and equating to θ⊗η so as to solve the metric compatibility equation
(2.2) we obtain a system of quadratic equations for our 6 parameters. Over F2, we
try all 64 parameter values for each of the three non-zero cases of α, β, ﬁnding
two solutions in each case. These are the unique nontrivial connections stated and
one common connection which is zero on the basic forms and for which σ ﬂips
the generators as is the case classically. One may then verify metric compatibility
directly as a check. That all four connections have zero curvature is obvious for the
trivial one and, otherwise for case (i)

R∇dx = (d ⊗ id − ∧(id ⊗ ∇))∇dx = − ∧ (id ⊗ ∇)(θ ⊗ θ) = −θ ∧ ∇θ = 0

and R∇µ is the same as ∇µ = ∇dx. For case (ii) we have

R∇dx = −dx ∧ ∇µ − µ ∧ ∇dx = −dx ∧ µ ⊗ µ − µ ∧ dx ⊗ µ − µ ∧ µ ⊗ dx = 0

FINITE NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRIES RELATED TO Fp[x]

and R∇µ = −µ∇µ = −µ ∧ µ ⊗ µ = 0. Case (iii) is similar.

21

(cid:3)

The trivial connection here can still be nonzero since ∇(adx+bµ) = da⊗dx+db⊗µ
for all a, b ∈ A2, and corresponds geometrically to what we might expect on an aﬃne
line. The other connections are more unexpected and it is remarkable that for each
metric we ﬁnd a unique nontrivial one. The existence of a second ‘nonclassical’
quantum Levi-Civita connection was also a feature in the concrete model in [1].
The general case of nonconstant α, β in Proposition 5.7 is much harder but can in
principle be analysed in the same way with additional dα, dβ terms entering.
