ABSTRACT

We present Hubble WFC3/IR slitless grism spectra of a remarkably bright z (cid:38) 10 galaxy candidate,
GN-z11, identiﬁed initially from CANDELS/GOODS-N imaging data. A signiﬁcant spectroscopic
continuum break is detected at λ = 1.47 ± 0.01 µm. The new grism data, combined with the pho-
tometric data, rule out all plausible lower redshift solutions for this source. The only viable solution
is that this continuum break is the Lyα break redshifted to zgrism = 11.09+0.08−0.12, just ∼400 Myr after
the Big Bang. This observation extends the current spectroscopic frontier by 150 Myr to well before
the Planck (instantaneous) cosmic reionization peak at z ∼ 8.8, demonstrating that galaxy build-up
was well underway early in the reionization epoch at z > 10. GN-z11 is remarkably and unexpectedly
its UV luminosity is 3× larger than L∗ measured at
luminous for a galaxy at such an early time:
z ∼ 6 − 8. The Spitzer IRAC detections up to 4.5 µm of this galaxy are consistent with a stellar mass
of ∼ 109 M(cid:12). This spectroscopic redshift measurement suggests that the James Webb Space Telescope
(JW ST ) will be able to similarly and easily conﬁrm such sources at z > 10 and characterize their
physical properties through detailed spectroscopy. Furthermore, WFIRST, with its wide-ﬁeld near-IR
imaging, would ﬁnd large numbers of similar galaxies and contribute greatly to JW ST ’s spectroscopy,
if it is launched early enough to overlap with JW ST .

1. INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst billion years are a crucial epoch in cosmic
history. This is when the ﬁrst stars and galaxies formed
and the universe underwent a major phase transition
from a neutral to an ionized state. Our understand-
ing of galaxies in this early phase of the universe has
been revolutionized over the last few years thanks to
the very sensitive WFC3/IR camera onboard the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST ) in combination with ultra-deep

Spitzer /IRAC imaging. WFC3/IR has pushed the ob-
servational horizon of galaxies to the beginning of the
cosmic reionization epoch at z ∼ 9 − 11, less than 500
Myr from the Big Bang. Several large extragalactic sur-
veys have now resulted in the identiﬁcation of a large
sample of more than 800 galaxies at z ∼ 7 − 8 (Bouwens
et al. 2015b; McLure et al. 2013; Finkelstein et al. 2015;
Bradley et al. 2014; Schmidt et al. 2014) and even a small
sample of z ∼ 9− 11 candidates (Oesch et al. 2013, 2014,
2015a; Ellis et al. 2013; Zheng et al. 2012; Coe et al. 2013;
Zitrin et al. 2014; Bouwens et al. 2015a; McLeod et al.
2015; Ishigaki et al. 2015; Infante et al. 2015; Kawamata
et al. 2015; Calvi et al. 2016).

Spectroscopic conﬁrmations of very high-redshift can-
didates remain limited, however. The primary spectral
feature accessible from the ground for these sources, the
Lyα line, is likely attenuated by the surrounding neutral
hydrogen for all z > 6 galaxies (Schenker et al. 2012;
Treu et al. 2013; Pentericci et al. 2014). Therefore, de-
spite the large number of candidates from HST imaging,
only a handful of galaxies in the epoch of reionization
have conﬁrmed redshifts to date (Vanzella et al. 2011;
Ono et al. 2012; Shibuya et al. 2012; Finkelstein et al.
2013; Oesch et al. 2015b; Roberts-Borsani et al. 2015;
Zitrin et al. 2015).

Given the low success rate of Lyα searches, a viable
alternative approach is to search for a spectroscopic con-
ﬁrmation of the UV continuum spectral break (see e.g.
Dow-Hygelund et al. 2005; Malhotra et al. 2005; Vanzella
et al. 2009; Rhoads et al. 2013; Watson et al. 2015; Pirzkal
et al. 2015). This break is expected owing to the near-

complete absorption of UV photons shortward of Lyα by
neutral hydrogen in the early universe. For the brightest
known z (cid:38) 7 candidates (H (cid:46) 26 AB mag), the contin-
uum ﬂux is within reach of the powerful WFC3/IR grism
spectrometer given the low near-infrared background at
the orbit of HST. Several surveys have thus been under-
taken or are ongoing to search for continuum breaks and
very weak Lyα lines with deep WFC3/IR grism spectra
(e.g. Treu et al. 2015; Schmidt et al. 2016; Pirzkal et al.
2015).
Our team recently discovered a small sample of z (cid:38) 9
candidate galaxies bright enough to test this approach at
the highest accessible redshifts with HST (Oesch et al.
2014).
In our analysis of the public CANDELS data
over the GOODS ﬁelds, we identiﬁed six relatively bright
(H160 = 26.0−26.8 mag) galaxies with best-ﬁt photomet-
ric redshifts z = 9.2−10.2. These sources more than dou-
bled the number of known galaxy candidates at 500 Myr.
Remarkably they were ∼10–20 times more luminous than
any prior candidate. The question thus arose whether
these bright galaxies really are at z > 9 or whether they
are part of a previously unknown population at lower red-
shifts. While the photometric data strongly indicate that
the candidates are very high-redshift galaxies, one could
not completely rule out extreme emission line galaxies at
lower redshift.

This paper presents the results of a 12 orbit WFC3/IR
grism spectroscopy program (GO-13871, PI:Oesch)
which targeted the intrinsically most luminous z (cid:38) 10
galaxy candidate among our previous sample. This pa-
per is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the
grism spectroscopy and ancillary imaging data before we
present the resulting spectrum, which provides strong
evidence for a continuum Lyman-break at z = 11.1 (see
Section 3). We end with a short discussion of our ﬁndings
in Section 4.
Throughout this paper, we adopt ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ =
0.7, H0 = 70 kms−1Mpc−1, i.e., h = 0.7, largely con-
sistent with the most recent measurements from Planck
(Planck Collaboration et al. 2015). Magnitudes are given
in the AB system (Oke & Gunn 1983), and we will re-
fer to the HST ﬁlters F435W, F606W, F814W, F105W,
F125W, F140W, F160W as B435, V606, I814, Y105, J125,
JH140, H160, respectively.

2. TARGET SELECTION AND DATA

2.1. Target Selection

Galaxy samples at z ∼ 9− 10 are now being assembled
based on deep HST imaging data (Zheng et al. 2012;
Oesch et al. 2013; Ellis et al. 2013; Coe et al. 2013;
Bouwens et al. 2015a; McLeod et al. 2015). Such distant
sources can be identiﬁed based on a continuum break
in the J125 band, i.e., at around 1.2 µm.
In a recent
analysis of the WFC3/IR imaging data from the pub-
lic CANDELS survey (Koekemoer et al. 2011; Grogin
et al. 2011), we identiﬁed six surprisingly bright sources
(H160 = 26.0 − 26.8 mag) with photometric redshifts
z = 9.2 − 10.2 in the two GOODS ﬁelds (Oesch et al.
2014).

Interestingly, a large fraction of these luminous z > 9
galaxy candidates were detected individually in the rest-
frame optical with Spitzer /IRAC (Fazio et al. 2004) data
from the S-CANDELS survey (Ashby et al. 2015). This
provides a sampling of the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of these sources from the rest-frame UV to the
rest-frame optical. The strong breaks measured in their
J125−H160 colors, the complete non-detections in the op-
tical images, and the blue colors from HST to IRAC sig-
niﬁcantly limit the contamination by known low-redshift
SEDs and together point to a true high-redshift nature
for all these sources. Stellar contamination could be ruled
out based on colors and sizes. Furthermore, no evidence
for contamination by an active galactic nucleus was found
based on variability over a 1 year timescale and X-ray
upper limits (Oesch et al. 2014). Nevertheless, spectro-
scopic conﬁrmation is clearly required to verify the high-
redshift solutions for these targets.
The brightness of these z ∼ 9 − 10 galaxy candidates
puts them within reach of WFC3/IR grism continuum
spectroscopy, opening up the possibility of obtaining a
grism redshift based on a continuum break. The bright-
est of these candidates, GN-z11, also had the highest pho-
tometric redshift and was thus identiﬁed as the target for
follow-up spectroscopy for our HST program GO-13871
(PI: Oesch).

GN-z11 lies in the CANDELS DEEP area in GOODS-
North at (RA,DEC) = (12:36:25.46, +62:14:31.4) and
has H160 = 26.0 ± 0.1. It was previously introduced as
GN-z10-1 (Oesch et al. 2014) or as source 20253 in the
3D-HST photometric catalog (Skelton et al. 2014). GN-
z11 also has the highest S/N in both IRAC bands (3.6
and 4.5 µm) among the sample of z ∼ 9−10 galaxies from
Oesch et al. (2014). The H160 proﬁle of GN-z11 shows
clear asymmetry with its isophotal area extending over
nearly 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6. A stellar source can therefore be excluded.
The depth of the data used to originally identify this
candidate was 27.8 mag in H160, 27.0 mag in IRAC chan-
nel 1, and 26.7 mag in channel 2 (all 5σ; see Oesch et al.
2014). The photometry of the target source is listed
in Table 1. Compared to our discovery paper (Oesch
et al. 2014), this includes new measurements in the two
IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 µm ﬁlters as well as in the WFC3/IR
JH140 band: deeper data are now available in JH140 as
part of our grism pre-imaging (see next section), and the
IRAC photometry was updated based on a new, inde-
pendent reduction of all available IRAC imaging data in
the Spitzer archive by our team (similar to Labb´e et al.
2015).

direction along which sources are dispersed in the slitless grism
spectra for our two individual epochs (magenta and blue) and for
the pre-existing AGHAST data (green). The latter are signiﬁcantly
contaminated by bright neighbors along the dispersion direction of
GN-z11 (see Fig 2).

2.2. Slitless Grism Data

The primary data analyzed in this paper are 12 orbit
deep G141 grism spectra from our HST program GO-
13871 (PI: Oesch). These spectra were taken at two dif-
ferent orients in two epochs of six orbits each on 2015
February 11 and April 3 (see Figure 1). The data ac-
quisition and observation planning followed the success-
ful 3D-HST grism program (Brammer et al. 2012; Mom-
cheva et al. 2015). Together with each G141 grism expo-
sure, a short 200 s pre-image with the JH140 ﬁlter was
taken to determine the zeroth order of the grism spectra.
The JH140 images were placed at the beginning and end
of each orbit in order to minimize the impact of variable
sky background on the grism exposure due to the bright
Earth limb and He 1.083 µm line emission from the upper
atmosphere (Brammer et al. 2014). A four-point dither
pattern was used to improve the sampling of the point-
spread function and to overcome cosmetic defects of the
detector.

The grism data were reduced using the grism reduc-
tion pipeline developed by the 3D-HST team. The main
reduction steps are explained in detail by Momcheva
et al. (2015).
In particular, the ﬂat-ﬁelded and global
background-subtracted grism images are interlaced to
produce 2D spectra for sources at a spectral sampling
of ∼23 ˚A, i.e., about one quarter of the native resolution
of the G141 grism. The ﬁnal 2D spectrum is a weighted
stack of the data from individual visits.
In particular,
we down-weight pixels which are aﬀected by neighbor-
contamination using

w = [(2 ∗ fcontam)2 + σ2]−1

ing sources in the slitless grism spectra around the trace of our
source (i.e., the line along which we expect its ﬂux; indicated by
red lines). From top to bottom, the panels show the ﬁnal model
contamination in our spectra in epochs 1 and 2 and in the pre-
existing AGHAST spectra. Note that the contamination model in-
cludes emission lines for the neighboring sources as calibrated from
our two-epoch data. The high contaminating ﬂux in the AGHAST
data makes these spectra inadequate for studying GN-z11. Our
orientations were chosen based on extensive simulations to mini-
mize such contamination from neighbors. However, some zeroth
order ﬂux in epoch 2 could not be avoided while at the same time
making the observations schedulable with HST in cycle 22.

where fcontam is the contamination model ﬂux in a par-
ticular pixel and σ is the per-pixel RMS taken from the
WFC3/IR noise model (c.f., §3.4.3 from Rajan & et al.
2011). We have tested that σ is accurately characterized
as demonstrated by the pixel ﬂux distribution function
in the 2D residual spectra (see Appendix Fig 11).

A local background is subtracted from the 2D frame
which is a simple 2nd order polynomial estimated from
the contamination-cleaned pixels above and below the
trace of the target source. 1D spectra are then com-
puted using optimal extraction on the ﬁnal 2D frames,
weighting the ﬂux by the morphology of the source as
measured in the WFC3/IR imaging (Horne 1986).

The GOODS-N ﬁeld, which contains our candidate
GN-z11, has previously been covered by 2 times 2-
orbit deep grism data from “A Grism H-Alpha Spec-
Troscopic survey” (AGHAST; GO-11600; PI: Wiener).
However, the spectrum of our target GN-z11 is signif-
icantly contaminated in the AGHAST observations by
several nearby galaxies given their orientation (see Fig-
ure 2). Furthermore, the observations were severely af-
fected by variable sky background (Brammer et al. 2014).
The ﬁnal data used in this paper therefore do not include
the AGHAST spectra, which were not optimized for GN-
z11 that was discovered 3–4 years after they were taken.
We conﬁrmed that including the AGHAST data would
not aﬀect our results, however, because of the down-
weighting of heavily contaminated pixels in our stacking
procedure.

2.3. The Challenge of Cleaning Slitless Grism Spectra
One major challenge in slitless grism spectroscopy is
the systematic contamination of the target spectrum by
light from nearby galaxies. Our spectra were therefore
taken at two orientations with the grism dispersion oﬀset
by 32 degrees and tailored to show the least possible con-
tamination while being schedulable (see Figure 2). The
optimal orientations were determined through extensive
simulations of the location of all orders from -1st to +3rd
of all sources in the ﬁeld detected in the extensive ancil-
lary imaging datasets. Nevertheless, some contaminating
ﬂux can never be avoided and needs to be modeled. Fol-
lowing the same techniques as developed for the 3D-HST
survey, this was done by ﬁtting all the neighboring galax-
ies’ SEDs (i.e., the EAZY template ﬁts to the Skelton et
al. photometric catalog) and using their morphologies
to create 2D spectral models for all of them, which were
then subtracted from the 2D spectrum of our target GN-
z11 spectrum.

Having access to deep grism spectra at multiple inde-
pendent orients also allows us to further reﬁne the 2D
spectral model of neighboring galaxies by including ac-
tually measured emission line ﬂuxes. We thus extracted
spectra of all neighboring sources at both orientations
and ﬁt their spectra as outlined by Momcheva et al.
(2015). The resulting best ﬁts were then used directly
as contamination models. This produces signiﬁcantly
cleaner 2D spectra compared to assuming simple con-
tinuum emission templates for contamination modeling.
The resulting contamination of all neighboring sources in
our data as well as in the AGHAST spectra are shown in
Figure 2. The quality of this quantitative contamination
model is also discussed in the next sections and shown in
Figure 3.

3. CONTINUUM DETECTION

The ﬁnal stacked 2D grism spectrum is shown in the
top panel of Figure 3. Clearly, contamination is signif-
icant outside of the expected trace of GN-z11. After
subtracting our detailed contamination model, however,
we obtain a clean 2D frame (middle panel of Fig 3). This
shows clear ﬂux exactly along the dispersion location of
GN-z11. After rebinning to a spectral resolution of 93 ˚A
(the native resolution element of the grism) this ﬂux de-
tection is ∼ 1 − 1.5σ per resolution element longward of
1.47 µm and consistent with zero ﬂux shortward of that.
The total spectral ﬂux averaged over 1.47-1.65 µm repre-
sents a clear 5.5σ detection. This is fully consistent with
the prediction from the exposure time calculator for an
H = 26 mag source in a 12-orbit exposure.

The extracted 1D spectrum along the trace of GN-
z11 is shown in Figures 4 and 5. These highlight the
detection of a continuum break with a ﬂux ratio of f (λ <
1.47)/f (λ > 1.47) < 0.32 at 2σ when averaged over 560
˚A wide spectral bins.
A ﬂux decrement is seen around ∼ 1.6 µm, which is
caused by negative ﬂux values in one of our two visits
slightly above the peak of the trace of GN-z11. However,
this dip is consistent with Gaussian deviates from the
noise model. We also tested that the detected continuum
ﬂux is still present when adopting diﬀerent stacking and
extraction procedures (see appendix A). In particular, we
conﬁrmed the spectral break in a simple median stack of

Fig. 3.— 2D grism data of GN-z11. The ﬁve panels show from
top to bottom (1) the original 2D spectrum from a stack of all
our G141 grism data, (2) the modeled contaminating ﬂux from
neighboring sources, (3) the cleaned 2D spectrum of GN-z11, (4)
the model of a z = 11.09 source with the same morphology and
H-band magnitude as GN-z11, and (5) the residual spectrum after
subtracting the z = 11.09 continuum model. The observed grism
ﬂux is completely consistent with the model ﬂux, as can be seen
from the clean residual. The observed spectrum also falls oﬀ at
∼ 1.65 µm, exactly as expected based on the drop in the G141
grism sensitivity providing further strong support that the observed
ﬂux is indeed the continuum of GN-z11. The spatial direction
extends over 3.6 arcsec, and the two red lines indicate the trace of
GN-z11.

the individual continuum-subtracted 2D grism observa-
tions of our 6 individual visits. Additionally, we con-
ﬁrmed that the continuum break is seen only along the
trace of our spectrum by creating simple 1D-extractions
above and below the trace of our target source. Finally,
we conﬁrmed that a break is seen in both epochs sepa-
rately (see Fig 10).

In the following sections, we discuss the possible red-
shift solutions for GN-z11 based on the combined con-
straints of the new grism continuum detection as well as
the pre-existing photometry.

3.1. The Best-ﬁt Solution: A z ∼ 11 Galaxy

Based on our previous photometric redshift measure-
ment for GN-z11 (zphot = 10.2), we expected to detect
a continuum break at 1.36 ± 0.05 µm. This can clearly
be ruled out. However, the grism data are consistent
with an even higher redshift solution. Interpreting the
observed break as the 1216 ˚A break, which is expected
for high-redshift galaxies based on absorption from the
neutral inter-galactic hydrogen along the line of sight,

Fig. 4.— The new 12-orbit deep grism spectra in combination with the photometry of GN-z11 exclude lower redshift solutions. The
main contaminants for high-redshift galaxy selections are sources with extreme emission lines or with very strong 4000 ˚A breaks. The top
left panel shows the photometry together with three example SEDs for the possible nature of GN-z11 (dark red: a z = 11.09 star-forming
galaxy, blue: an extreme line emitter at z = 2.1, green: a dusty+quiescent galaxy at z = 2.5). The last one is only shown for illustration
purposes as it can be clearly excluded based on the longer wavelength photometry (∆χ2
p > 8000 relative to the best ﬁt SED model). The
remaining panels compare the observed 1D spectrum with the expected grism ﬂuxes for the same three cases. The best-ﬁt to the grism data
is provided by the high-redshift LBG template which interprets the observed break as a Lyα break. This solution has a reduced χ2 = 1.2.
The other two cases can be excluded based on the diﬀerence in χ2 in the grism spectra as well as from the photometry (χ2

p).

we obtain a very good ﬁt to the spectrum with a re-
duced χ2 = 1.2 (see Figs 4 and 5). The best ﬁt redshift
is zgrism = 11.09+0.08−0.12, corresponding to a cosmic time
of only ∼400 Myr after the Big Bang. The grism red-
shift and its uncertainty are derived from an MCMC ﬁt
to the 2D spectrum which also includes the morphologi-
cal information of the source as well as the photometry,
adopting identical techniques as used for the 3D-HST
survey redshifts (see Momcheva et al. 2015).

This high-redshift solution also reproduces the ex-
pected count rate based on an H = 26 mag continuum
source, as well as the overall morphology of the 2D grism
spectrum. This is demonstrated in Figure 3, where we
show the original data, the neighbor subtracted 2D spec-
trum as well as the residual after subtracting out the
z = 11.09 model with the correct H-band magnitude.
Note the drop of the ﬂux longward of 1.65 µm due to the
reduced sensitivity of the grism. This is an important
constraint, because it shows that the detected ﬂux orig-
inates from the source itself and is not due to residual
neighbor contamination.

Figure 11 (in the appendix) further shows that the
pixel distribution of the residual 2D frame is in excel-
lent agreement with the expectations from pure Gaus-
sian noise. This demonstrates that our contamination
subtraction and ﬂux uncertainty estimates were derived
appropriately and that the resulting values are accurate.
Despite the diﬀerence from the previous photometric

redshift estimate, the measured grism redshift is con-
sistent with the photometry of this source (see Figure
6). While our previous photometric redshift estimate
was zphot = 10.2 ± 0.4, the redshift likelihood function
contained a signiﬁcant tail to z > 11. The updated
and deeper JH140 photometry subsequently resulted in
a shift of the peak by ∆z = 0.2 to a higher redshift.
The z = 11.09 solution is within 1σ of the now better
measured JH140 − H160 color, which is the main driver
for the photometric redshift estimate, as shown in Fig-
ure 6. The grism data signiﬁcantly tighten the redshift
likelihood function (bottom panel Figure 6) in addition
to excluding lower redshift solutions.

In the next two sections we also show that we can
safely exclude all plausible lower redshift solutions. The
new grism redshift conﬁrms that this source lies well be-
yond the peak epoch of cosmic reionization (zreion = 8.8;
Planck Collaboration et al. 2015) and makes it the most
distant known galaxy. This includes sources with pho-
tometric redshift measurements, apart from a highly de-
bated source in the HUDF/XDF ﬁeld, which likely lies at
z ∼ 2 but has a potential z ∼ 12 solution (see Bouwens
et al. 2011, 2013; Ellis et al. 2013; Brammer et al. 2013).

3.2. Excluding a Lower-Redshift Strong Line Emitter
The principal goal of our grism program was to un-
equivocally exclude a lower redshift solution for the
source GN-z11. While GN-z11 shows a very strong con-

Fig. 5.— Grism Spectrum of GN-z11. The top panel shows the (negative) 2D spectrum from the stack of our cycle 22 data (12 orbits)
with the trace outlined by the dark red lines. For clarity the 2D spectrum was smoothed by a Gaussian indicated by the ellipse in the lower
right corner. The bottom panel is the un-smoothed 1D ﬂux density using an optimal extraction rebinned to one resolution element of the
G141 grism (93 ˚A). The black dots show the same further binned to 560 ˚A, while the blue line shows the contamination level that was
subtracted from the original object spectrum. We identify a continuum break in the spectrum at λ = 1.47 ± 0.01 µm. The continuum ﬂux
at λ > 1.47 µm is detected at ∼ 1 − 1.5σ per resolution element and at 3.8σ per 560 ˚A bin. After excluding lower redshift solutions (see
text and Fig 4), the best-ﬁt grism redshift is zgrism = 11.09+0.08−0.12. The red line reﬂects the Lyα break at this redshift, normalized to the
measured H-band ﬂux of GN-z11. The agreement is excellent. The fact that we only detect signiﬁcant ﬂux along the trace of our target
source, which is also consistent with the measured H-band magnitude, is strong evidence that we have indeed detected the continuum of
GN-z11 rather than any residual contamination.

tinuum break with J125 − H160 > 2.4 (2σ), without
a spectrum, we could not exclude contamination by a
source with very extreme emission lines with line ratios
reproducing a seemingly ﬂat continuum longward of 1.4
µm (Oesch et al. 2014).

The previous AGHAST spectra already provided
some evidence against strong emission line contam-
ination (Oesch et al. 2014), and we also obtained
Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy to further strengthen this
conclusion (see appendix). However, the additional 12
orbits of G141 grism data now conclusively rule out that
GN-z11 is such a lower redshift source. Assuming that all
the H-band ﬂux came from one emission line, we would
have detected this line at > 10σ. Even when assuming
a more realistic case where the emission line ﬂux is dis-
tributed over a combination of lines (e.g., Hβ + [O III]),
we can conﬁdently invalidate such a solution. The lower
left panel in Figure 4 compares the measured grism spec-
trum with that expected for the best-ﬁt lower redshift
solution we had previously identiﬁed (Oesch et al. 2014).
A strong line emitter SED is clearly inconsistent with
the data. Apart from the emission lines, which we do
not detect, this model also predicts weak continuum ﬂux
across the whole wavelength range. At < 1.47 µm, this is

higher than the observed mean, while at > 1.47 µm the
expected ﬂux is too low compared to the observations.
Overall the likelihood of a z ∼ 2 extreme emission line
SED based on our grism data is less than 10−6 and can
be ruled out.

Note that in very similar grism observations for a
source triply imaged by a CLASH foreground clus-
ter, emission line contamination could also be excluded
(Pirzkal et al. 2015). We thus have no indication cur-
rently that any of the recent z ∼ 9−11 galaxy candidates
identiﬁed with HST is a lower redshift strong emission
line contaminant (but see, e.g., Brammer et al. 2013, for
a possible z ∼ 12 candidate).

3.3. Excluding a Lower-Redshift Dusty or Quiescent

Galaxy

Another potential source of contamination for very
high redshift galaxy samples are dusty z ∼ 2 − 3 sources
with strong 4000 ˚A or Balmer breaks (Oesch et al. 2012;
Hayes et al. 2012). However, the fact that the IRAC data
for GN-z11 show that it has a very blue continuum long-
ward of 1.6 µm, together with the very red color in the
WFC3/IR photometry, already rules out such a solution
(see SED plot in Figure 4). Nevertheless, we additionally

explore what constraints the grism spectrum alone can
set on such a solution.

The expected ﬂux for such a red galaxy increases grad-
ually across the wavelength range covered by the G141
grism, unlike what we observe in the data (lower right
in Fig 4). Compared to our best-ﬁt solution (see next
section) we measure a ∆χ2 = 15 when comparing the
data with the expected grism ﬂux. Apart from the ex-
tremely large discrepancy with the IRAC photometry, we
can thus exclude this solution at 98.9% conﬁdence based
on the spectrum alone.

Similar conclusions can be drawn from the break
strength alone (see e.g. Spinrad et al. 1998). Assum-
ing that the observed break at 1.47 µm corresponds to
4000 ˚A at z = 2.7, a galaxy with a maximally old spec-
tral energy distribution (single burst at z = 15) would
show a ﬂux ratio of (1 − f short
) < 0.63 when av-
eraged over 560 ˚A bins. This is based on simple Bruzual
& Charlot (2003) models without any dust. As men-
tioned earlier, the observed spectrum has a break of
(1 − f short
) > 0.68 at 2σ, thus indicating again
that we can marginally rule out a 4000 ˚A break based
on the spectrum alone without even including the pho-
tometric constraints.

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. Physical Properties of GN-z11

Despite being the most distant known galaxy, GN-z11
is relatively bright and reliably detected in both IRAC
3.6 and 4.5 µm bands from the S-CANDELS survey
(Ashby et al. 2015). This provides a sampling of its rest-
frame UV spectral energy distribution and even partially
covers the rest-frame optical wavelengths in the IRAC
4.5 µm band (see Figure 6).
The photometry of GN-z11 is consistent with a spectral
energy distribution (SED) of log M/M(cid:12) ∼ 9 using stan-
dard templates (Bruzual & Charlot 2003, see appendix).
The UV continuum is relatively blue with a UV spectral
slope β = −2.5±0.2 as derived from a powerlaw ﬁt to the
H160, K, and [3.6] ﬂuxes only, indicating very little dust
extinction (see also Wilkins et al. 2016). Together with
the absence of a strong Balmer break, this is consistent
with a young stellar age of this galaxy. The best ﬁt age
is only 40 Myr (< 110 Myr at 1σ). GN-z11 thus formed
its stars relatively rapidly. The inferred star-formation
rate is 24±10 M(cid:12)/yr. All the inferred physical parame-
ters for GN-z11 are summarized in Table 2. Overall, our
results show that galaxy build-up was well underway at
∼ 400 Myr after the Big Bang.

4.2. The Number Density of Very Bright z > 10

Galaxies

The spectrum of GN-z11 indicates that its contin-
uum break lies within the H160 ﬁlter (which covers
∼ 1.4−1.7 µm; see Fig 6). The rest-frame UV continuum
ﬂux of this galaxy is therefore ∼0.4 mag brighter than
inferred from the H160 magnitude. The estimated abso-
lute magnitude is MU V = −22.1 ± 0.2, which is roughly
a magnitude brighter (i.e., a factor 3×) than the char-
acteristic luminosity of the UV luminosity function at
z ∼ 7− 8 (Bouwens et al. 2015b; Finkelstein et al. 2015).
With zgrism = 11.09, the galaxy GN-z11 is thus surpris-
ingly bright and distant (see Figure 5). While one single

tral energy distribution (SED; gray) of GN-z11 at the measured
grism redshift of z = 11.09. Upper limits correspond to 1σ non-
detections. The black squares correspond to the ﬂux measurements
of the best-ﬁt SED. Inset negative images of 6(cid:48)(cid:48)×6(cid:48)(cid:48) show the HST
J125, JH140, and H160 bands as well as the neighbor-cleaned IRAC
4.5 µm image. GN-z11 is robustly detected in all bands longward
of 1.4 µm, resulting in accurate constraints on its physical param-
eters. The photometry is consistent with a galaxy stellar mass
of log M/M(cid:12) ∼ 9.0 with no or very little dust extinction and a
young average stellar age. Middle – A zoom-in around the wave-
length range probed by the G141 grism. The rebinned grism data
are shown by the blue line with errorbars. The grism ﬂux is con-
sistent with the photometry (red points) and the best-ﬁt SED at
z = 11.09 (gray line). The red horizontal errorbars represent the
wavelength coverage of the diﬀerent HST ﬁlters, indicating that
the break of GN-z11 lies within the H160 band. Bottom – The
redshift probability distribution functions, p(z), when ﬁtting only
to the broad-band photometry (red) or when including both the
photometry and the grism in the ﬁts (blue). The photometric p(z)
peaks at signiﬁcantly lower redshift, but contains an extended tail
to z > 11. The addition of the grism data signiﬁcantly tightens the
p(z) resulting in uncertainties of ∆z (cid:39) 0.1. The ﬁts that include
the old, shallower JH140 photometry are shown in gray, while those
that use the grism data alone, without any photometric constraints,
are shown in green.

to estimate how many such galaxies we could have ex-
pected based on (1) the currently best estimates of the
UV LF at z > 8 and (2) based on theoretical models and
simulations.
Our target was found in a search of the GOODS ﬁelds,
which amount to ∼ 160 arcmin2. However, in a sub-
sequent search of the three remaining CANDELS ﬁelds
no similar sources were found with likely redshifts at
z (cid:38) 10 (Bouwens et al. 2015a). We therefore use the
full 750 arcmin2 of the CANDELS ﬁelds with match-
ing WFC3/IR and ACS imaging for a volume estimate,
which amounts to 1.2×106 Mpc3 (assuming ∆z = 1).
Using the simple trends in the Schechter parameters of
the UV LFs measured UV at lower redshift (z ∼ 4 − 8)
and extrapolating these to z = 11, we can get an empir-
ical estimate of the number density of very bright galax-
ies at z ∼ 11. This amounts to 0.06 (Bouwens et al.
2015b) or 0.002 (Finkelstein et al. 2015) expected galax-
ies brighter than MUV = −22.1 in our survey correspond-
ing to less than 0.3 per surveyed square degree. Simi-
larly, recent empirical models (Mashian et al. 2016; Ma-
son et al. 2015; Trac et al. 2015) predict only 0.002−0.03
galaxies as bright as GN-z11 in our survey or 0.01−0.2
per deg2. All the assumed LF parameters together with
the resulting estimates of the number of expected bright
galaxies Nexp are listed in Table 3.

The above estimates illustrate that our discovery of
the unexpectedly luminous galaxy GN-z11 may challenge
our current understanding of galaxy build-up at z > 8.
A possible solution is that the UV LF does not follow
a Schechter function form at the very bright end as has
been suggested by some authors at z ∼ 7 (Bowler et al.
2014), motivated by ineﬃcient feedback in the very early
universe. However, current evidence for this is still weak
(see discussion in Bouwens et al. 2015b). Larger area
studies will be required in the future (such as the planned
WFIRST High Latitude Survey; Spergel et al. 2015) sur-
veying several square degrees to determine the bright end
of the UV LF to resolve this puzzle.

redshift galaxies from blank ﬁeld surveys. Dark ﬁlled squares corre-
spond to spectroscopically conﬁrmed sources, while small gray dots
are photometric redshifts (Bouwens et al. 2015b). GN-z11 clearly
stands out as one of the most luminous currently known galaxies at
all redshifts z > 6 and is by far the most distant measured galaxy
with spectroscopy (black squares; see Oesch et al. 2015b, for a full
list of references). Wider area surveys with future near-infrared
telescopes (such as WFIRST) will be required to determine how
common such luminous sources really are at z > 10.

z11. Our 2D data show clear ﬂux longward of ∼ 1.47 µm
exactly along the trace of the target galaxy and zero
ﬂux at shorter wavelengths, thanks to our comprehensive
and accurate treatment of contamination by neighboring
galaxies. The interpretation that we indeed detect the
continuum ﬂux from GN-z11 is supported by the mor-
phology of the spectrum, the fact that the counts fall oﬀ
exactly where the sensitivity of the G141 grism drops, as
well as the consistency of the observed counts with the
H-band magnitude of GN-z11 (see e.g. Fig 3).

The grism spectrum, combined with the photometric
constraints, allows us to exclude plausible low-redshift
SEDs for GN-z11 at high conﬁdence. In particular, we
can invalidate a low redshift SED of an extreme line emit-
ter galaxy at z ∼ 2 (see section 3 and Fig 4). Instead,
the grism spectrum is completely consistent with a very
high-redshift solution at zgrism = 11.09+0.08−0.12 (see Figures
3 and 5). This indicates that this galaxy lies at only
∼ 400 Myr after the Big Bang, extending the previous
redshift record by ∼ 150 Myr.

GN-z11 is not only the most distant spectroscopically
measured source, but is likely even more distant than
all other high-redshift candidates with photometric red-
shifts, including MACS0647-JD at zphot = 10.7+0.6−0.4 (Coe

et al. 2013). Additionally, GN-z11 is surprisingly bright,
being among the brightest of any galaxies currently iden-
tiﬁed at z > 6 (see Figure 7). An SED ﬁt to the pho-
tometry indicates that GN-z11 has built up a relatively
large stellar mass (∼ 109 M(cid:12)) for a galaxy at such an
early time. This unexpectedly luminous galaxy may chal-
lenge our current understanding of early galaxy build-up.
While the UV luminosity function of galaxies is not yet
very accurately measured at z > 8, the expected number
density of such bright galaxies at z ∼ 11 is extremely
small in most model estimates (< 0.3 deg−2). The fact
that such a galaxy is found in only 0.2 deg2 of the joint
ACS and WFC3/IR data from the CANDELS survey is
therefore somewhat surprising. Future surveys of at least
several deg2 will be required to accurately determine the
number densities of such bright galaxies at z > 8 and to
characterize the bright end of the UV luminosity func-
tion. In particular, the planned high-latitude survey with
WFIRST reaching to H > 26 mag is expected to ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant number of such bright sources.

The spectroscopic measurement of GN-z11 as a high-
redshift source proves that massive galaxies of a billion
solar masses already existed at less than 500 Myr after
the Big Bang and that galaxy build-up was well under-
way at z > 10. This is also promising news for future

observations with the upcoming James Webb Space Tele-
scope (JWST ), which will be able to ﬁnd galaxies at
even earlier times. While challenging with HST now,
JWST /NIRSPEC observations will be extremely eﬃ-
cient at conﬁrming and measuring redshifts for all the
current bright z (cid:38) 9 galaxy candidates. JWST will push
to much earlier times and also result in much larger sam-
ples of spectroscopically-conﬁrmed sources within the
ﬁrst 500 Myr of cosmic time, particularly at z (cid:46) 12
if WFIRST is launched early enough to overlap with
JWST. Until JWST, however, GN-z11 is quite likely to
remain the most distant conﬁrmed source.

A. CONSISTENCY CHECKS OF GRISM STACKING AND EXTRACTIONS

APPENDIX

A.1. Median Stacking

In the main part of our analysis, we use a weighted sum to combine the 2D grism data from the 6 diﬀerent visits
to the ﬁnal 12-orbit data.
In particular, our weight includes a term to down-weight pixels which are aﬀected by
contamination (see Eq. 1). To ensure the detected signal is not the result of our stacking procedure, we additionally
computed a simple median-stacked spectrum. This is shown in Figure 8. The median stack clearly still shows the
continuum break, albeit it is somewhat noisier overall, since it does not include any contamination-based weighting.
Nevertheless, the median ﬂux is consistent with the expected count rate for an H160 = 26 mag source at zgrism = 11.09.

A.2. Extractions Across the Trace

The 1D spectrum in the main body of the paper is based on an optimal extraction taking into account the asymmetric
morphology of GN-z11. Figure 9 shows diﬀerent 1D extractions as a function of position relative to the peak of the
trace of GN-z11. These are simple sums extending over 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)18 (i.e. 3 pixels) in the spatial direction. These 1D spectra
show consistency with the expected count rate from our H-band morphological model of GN-z11. The ﬁgure also
shows that the negative dip at ∼ 1.6 µm stems from negative pixels slightly above the peak trace of GN-z11. We
ensured that these negative pixels are not the result of any cosmic rays or inaccurate persistence or contamination
subtraction. The dip extending over 3 rebinned pixels is consistent with simple Gaussian ﬂuctuations based on our
noise model.

A.3. Data Split By Epoch

We also tested whether a break is seen when further splitting up the data into our two independent epochs. The S/N
of the continuum detection in the ﬁnal 12-orbit stack shown in the main body of the paper is already relatively low,
but this split-data test is a good cross-check on the viability and consistency of the result. These data of the individual
epoch each consist of 6 orbits but at two diﬀerent orientations, resulting in diﬀerent contamination levels as a function
of wavelength. Figure 10 shows both the 2D and the corresponding 1D spectra for both epochs. When rebinned to 560
˚A a continuum break is seen in both epochs separately, consistent with our best-ﬁt redshift zgrism = 11.09. However,
the S/N at 93 ˚A resolution in these spectra is small and the detailed diﬀerences should not be over-interpreted.

While some pixels oﬀ the trace in Fig. 10 show residual ﬂux in the epoch-split data, these pixels are heavily
contaminated by neighboring galaxies and are downweighted in the ﬁnal stack. In Fig. 11 we show the ﬁnal stacked
pixel ﬂux distribution within 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6 of the trace, which is perfectly consistent with a Gaussian. This demonstrates that
our neighbor subtraction model and our pixel RMS estimates are both accurate.

B. KECK MOSFIRE SPECTROSCOPY

Before the HST grism spectra, GN-z11 was also observed with ground-based near-infrared spectra. We used
Keck/MOSFIRE on 2014 April 25 to obtain J, H, and K-band coverage of GN-z11 (as well as lower redshift ﬁller
targets). The exposure times were 2.8 hrs in J, 1.0 hr in H, and 1.0 hr in K. The main purpose of these spectra was to
rule out strong emission line contamination. With a seeing ranging from 0.8−1.4(cid:48)(cid:48) and some cirrus clouds throughout
the night, these spectra are not extremely constraining. However, the higher spectral resolution compared to the
WFC3/IR grism allows us to search for narrower emission lines. None were found. In between sky lines, our spectra
are sensitive to emission line ﬂuxes of ∼ 2− 4× 10−17 erg s−1 cm2 (5σ). These observations therefore already provided
some evidence against strong emission line contamination before the acquisition of the WFC3/IR grism spectra.

C. ESTIMATING STELLAR POPULATION PROPERTIES

Spectral energy distribution ﬁtting to the photometry was used to estimate several stellar population properties of
GN-z11 listed in Table 2. This was done using the code ZEBRA+ (Oesch et al. 2010), an extension of the photometric
redshift code ZEBRA (Feldmann et al. 2006). The stellar population templates were based on standard libraries
(Bruzual & Charlot 2003), however, nebular continuum and line emission were added self-consistently assuming all
ionizing photons are transformed to nebular emission. The allowed star-formation histories were based on standard
exponentially declining models with parameters τ = 108, 109, and constant star-formation, with stellar metallicities of
Z = 0.05 − 0.5Z(cid:12), and a Chabrier initial mass function. The ages of the models ranged from 106 yr to the age of the
universe at the given redshift. Dust extinction was allowed in the ﬁt using a standard starburst dust model (Calzetti
et al. 2000). The resulting stellar mass derived for GN-z11 is log M/M(cid:12) = 9.0 with formal uncertainties ∆ log M = 0.4
as derived from the χ2 values of all SEDs in the library. We note, however, that our longest wavelength ﬁlter, IRAC
channel 2, only partially covers the rest-frame optical for GN-z11 at λrf > 4000 ˚A, which is why we only report an
approximate stellar mass in the main body of the text. Other physical parameters are listed in Table 2.

Fig. 8.— The 1D spectrum based on a simple median stack of the data from our 6 individual visits, rather than an optimal weighted
stack. The gray histogram with errorbars shows the median spectrum rebinned to ∼ 93 ˚A wide spectral bins. The median stacked ﬂux
still shows the spectral break at ∼ 1.47 µm and is consistent with the expected count rate of an H160 = 26 mag source at zgrism = 11.09,
which is shown by the red line. Black points with errorbars show the same 1D spectrum rebinned to 560 ˚A. Note that this simple median
stack does not optimally account for pixels aﬀected by contamination and is overall noisier than the spectrum used in our main analysis.

Fig. 9.— 1D spectra extracted at diﬀerent oﬀsets from the peak of the trace of GN-z11 (lower panels). The colored lines with errorbars
show a simple sum of the ﬂux over 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)18 (3 pixels) in the spatial direction, oﬀset in 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)18 steps relative to each other. The regions over which
the spectra are extracted are indicated in the top panel showing the 2D spectrum. The solid red line represents the expected 1D ﬂux at each
location based on our morphological model of GN-z11 with H160 = 26 mag and at a redshift of zgrism = 11.09. (The discontinuities arise
because the trace is slightly tilted.) Note that the asymmetric proﬁle of GN-z11 extending over 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6 (see H160-band stamp in the upper
left) results in an asymmetric ﬂux distribution relative to the peak of the trace. The negative dip at ∼ 1.6 µm is seen most pronounced at
+0.(cid:48)(cid:48)18 above the peak of the trace of GN-z11.

Fig. 10.— The 2D (top) and 1D (bottom) grism spectra of GN-z11 split in the two independent epochs of data from our program (epoch
1 left panels; epoch 2 right panels). Both of these have an exposure time of 6 orbits each, but their neighbor contamination is very diﬀerent
due to the diﬀerent orientations (see Figure 2). The blue lines show the contamination level which was subtracted from the 1D spectra.
As in Fig 5, the top panel has been slightly smoothed for clarity and the lower panels show the 1D ﬂux density binned to one resolution
element of the G141 grism (93 ˚A). As expected for a 6 orbit exposure, the continuum S/N is (cid:46) 1 at this resolution. The black dots with
errorbars are the binned spectrum to 560 ˚A. The continuum break is detected in both epochs separately.

Fig. 11.— Histogram of pixel residuals within ±0.(cid:48)(cid:48)6 of the trace in the 2D spectrum after subtracting out the best-ﬁt model of GN-z11.
The salmon colored line is the best-ﬁt Gaussian distribution, which is in excellent agreement with the expectation of a Gaussian centered
at µ = 0 with σ = 1 (dark red line). This demonstrates that our pixel noise estimates are accurate and that our extracted spectra are not
aﬀected by systematic uncertainties from neighbor modeling.
