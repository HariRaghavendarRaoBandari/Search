We present the implementation of a programmable atom-photon quantum interface, employing
a single trapped 40Ca+ ion and single photons. Depending on its mode of operation, the interface
serves as a bi-directional atom-photon quantum-state converter, as a source of entangled atom-
photon states, or as a quantum frequency converter of single photons. The interface lends itself
particularly to interfacing ions with single or entangled photons in hybrid quantum networks.

Quantum networks [1] integrate quantum-information
processing and storage devices with quantum communi-
cation channels, allowing one to distribute quantum in-
formation between stationary network nodes through ﬂy-
ing quantum bits (qubits). A platform that has proven
suitable for this purpose is the combination of single
trapped ions and single photons: while single ions al-
low for storing and processing quantum information [2–
4], single photons are the only viable carriers of quantum
information over long distance [5, 6]. In order to inter-
convert stationary and ﬂying qubits, quantum interfaces
are needed. Diﬀerent approaches for the experimental
implementation of atom-photon quantum interfaces have
emerged. These include objectives and lenses of high nu-
merical aperture [7, 8], deep parabolic mirrors [9, 10],
and optical resonators [11–14]. With these systems, a
number of essential quantum-networking building blocks
have been realized, such as atom-photon entanglement
[15, 16], atom-to-photon quantum-state mapping [17–19],
heralded atom-atom entanglement [20, 21], quantum tele-
portation [22] and direct quantum-state transfer [23]. We
demonstrated further basic prerequisites of a quantum
network such as the high-rate generation of single pho-
tons in a pure quantum state [24] and the direct photonic
interaction between distant single ions [25]. Recently, we
implemented a protocol for high-ﬁdelity heralded transfer
of a photonic polarization qubit onto the qubit state of a
single ion [26]. Here we report on a signiﬁcant and com-
prehensive extension of that protocol, the realization of
a programmable, bi-directional interface between a sin-
gle ion and single photons, which depending on its mode
of operation permits atom-to-photon or photon-to-atom
quantum-state transfer, as well as generation of atom-
photon entanglement; moreover, it is also suitable for
quantum frequency conversion of single photons.

Interface principle

Fig. 1 illustrates the general principle of the interface,
experimentally implemented with the ground and excited
states of a single 40Ca+ ion. We ﬁrst create a coherent
superposition of the two outer Zeeman sublevels of the

metastable D5/2 state,

and expose the ion to resonant photons on the D5/2 to

state in the circular (R/L) basis,

such that the input state of the interface is |Ψin(cid:105) =
|ψD(cid:105)|ψ854(cid:105). Right-handed (R) and left-handed (L) cir-
cularly polarized 854 nm photons may be absorbed on
the σ+ and σ− transition, respectively. Absorption of a
photon triggers the emission of a single Raman photon
on the P3/2 to S1/2 transition at 393 nm and transfers
the ion to the S1/2 ground state. For detection along the
quantization axis, the two possible transitions, σ+ and
σ−, translate to R- and L-polarized 393 nm photons, re-
spectively. We hence obtain the ion-photon output state

and used to realize the diﬀerent interface operations: (i)
when |ψD(cid:105) and |ψ854(cid:105) are ﬁxed, entangled atom-photon
pairs are created (entangler operation); (ii) when |Ψout(cid:105)
is projected by detecting the 393 nm photon in a linear
basis, the polarization state of the absorbed 854 nm pho-
ton is mapped into an atomic qubit state in S1/2 (receiver
operation); (iii) when the ﬁnal atomic state is projected
on a superposition of the Zeeman sublevels, the initial
atomic state |ψD(cid:105) is mapped into the polarization qubit
of the output 393 nm photon (sender operation); (iv) ﬁ-
nally, when both atomic superpositions are ﬁxed, any in-
put photon will be converted into a frequency-converted
output photon of the corresponding polarization (con-
verter operation). Receiver operation has been shown
in [26], entangler and sender operation are demonstrated
below. Quantum frequency conversion of photons from
854 nm to 393 nm is implicitly realized by these demon-
strations.

Experimental procedure

Our experimental set-up is sketched in Fig. 2. A single
40Ca+ ion is conﬁned in a linear Paul trap and Doppler
cooled by frequency-stabilized diode lasers [28]. A static
magnetic ﬁeld B = 2.8 G deﬁnes the quantization axis.
Atomic state preparation in |ψD(cid:105) is performed in three
steps [26, 27]: ﬁrst the ion is optically pumped to the
2(cid:105) level of S1/2, then a radio-frequency (RF) π/2-pulse
|− 1
from a coil below the trap excites the magnetic-dipole
transition between the S1/2 sublevels to form an equal
superposition of |± 1
2(cid:105), and ﬁnally two π-pulses from a
narrow-band laser at 729 nm coherently excite the |± 1
2(cid:105)
populations to the respective |± 5

2(cid:105) levels in D5/2.

A laser at 854 nm provides the polarized photons at
854 nm. Since for ion-to-photon state transfer as well as
for ion-photon entanglement (sender and entangler op-
eration) the 854 nm polarization is kept ﬁxed, the laser
propagation and polarization direction are both chosen
orthogonal to the quantization axis. Photons at 393 nm
emitted by the ion are collected along the quantiza-
tion axis through an in-vacuum high-NA laser objective
(HALO, [29]). The photons are projected onto a chosen
polarization and sent to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)
via multi-mode optical ﬁbers. The output pulses of the
PMTs, corresponding to the arrivals of single photons,
are time-tagged for later processing. Another HALO col-
lects ﬂuorescence from cooling laser excitation.

tive, PMT: photomultiplier tube, Wave plates: one half-wave
and one quarter-wave plate, (cid:126)B: magnetic-ﬁeld direction. The
ion is trapped between the HALOs.

A typical experiment starts with the preparation of
a given symmetric superposition in D5/2 according to
Eq. (1), which has angles ϑD = π
2 , and ϕD = ϕ729 + ωLt.
Here ϕ729 is the (adjustable [27]) phase between the two
preparation pulses of the 729 nm laser, and ωLt is the
phase that the superposition accumulates with time due
to its Larmor precession [26, 27], t = 0 marking its prepa-
ration. The ion is excited with 854 nm photons of ﬁxed
linear polarization (ϑ854 = π
2 , ϕ854 = π), and detection
events of 393 nm photons in various polarization bases are
recorded in the form of arrival-time histograms. For ver-
ifying ion-to-photon state transfer as well as ion-photon
entanglement, the correlation of these photon detections
with the projection of the atom onto a speciﬁc superpo-
sition state is analyzed.

to a reduced visibility, with the behaviour expected from
the model [27],

The oscillation period of about 64 ns corresponds to the

magnetic ﬁeld B = 2.8 G and taking into account the
Land´e factors of the S1/2 and D5/2 manifolds. The overall
envelope of P (t) displays the exponential decay (with the
Raman scattering rate) of the probability for the atom to
remain in D5/2 while it is exposed to the 854 nm photons.
From data as in Fig. 3(a), we perform full tomogra-
phy of the photonic polarization. We project the photon

system through correlation measurements in the product
bases of photonic and atomic qubit. Using a maximum-
likelihood approach [30], we reconstruct the physical
quantum state that is most likely to have produced the
experimental data. From the derived density matrix, de-
picted in Fig. 4, we ﬁnd a ﬁdelity F = 84.6(2) % with
respect to the maximally entangled state (Eq. (3)) for
our 450 ns time window. This value exceeds the classical
threshold of 2
3 by more than 80 standard deviations and
thus clearly indicates the creation of entanglement at the
output of our interface.

wave and quarter-wave plate. As a trade-oﬀ between high
ﬁdelity of the photonic state and high detection eﬃciency,
we select detection events within the ﬁrst 450 ns of the
arrival-time distribution, and we display them as a func-
tion of the Larmor phase ϕL = 2π( t
T mod 1). Fig. 3(b)
shows the Poincar´e components of the reconstructed po-
larization state. As expected, the linear polarization ro-
tates with the Larmor phase, and the two linear bases
show a π
2 phase diﬀerence. The ellipticity of the polar-
ization (R/L component) is close to zero, with a slightly
visible oscillation originating from a non-perfect calibra-
tion of the wave plates.

Entangler operation

FIG. 4. Density matrix of the entangled ion-photon state in
the product basis. Shown are the moduli of the matrix entries.

The two main sources of inﬁdelity in our set-up are cur-
rently magnetic-ﬁeld ﬂuctuations which limit the atomic
coherence time and, as mentioned above, non-perfectly
calibrated wave plates. The photon-detection eﬃciency
for this experiment amounts to 0.353(1) %,
including
that only 50 % of the arriving photons are transmitted
through the polarization analyzer. At 11 kHz repetition
rate and taking the PMT quantum eﬃciency of 28(1) %
into account, we obtain 140(5) s−1 ﬁber-coupled photons.
Removing the polarization analysis would thus provide
up to 300 s−1 ﬁber-coupled photons that are entangled
with the ion.

Sender operation

Operation of our interface for ion-to-photon quantum-
state transfer is accomplished when a prepared atomic
input state, characterized by angles ϑD and ϕD (Eq. 1)
leads to the emission of a 393 nm output photon in the
corresponding polarization state. This interface opera-
tion involves projection of the ﬁnal atomic state onto a
ﬁxed superposition, for which we choose the |+(cid:105) state.
In this case the 393 nm photon detected at time t will be
described by

In order to verify the operation of our interface as a

played in Fig. 5(b). The value χ11 represents the iden-
tity part of the quantum process and is known as the
process ﬁdelity. From our experimental data, we de-
rive χ11 = 90.2(1.0) %. Another measure for the qual-
ity of the state transfer is the mean ﬁdelity of the recon-
structed photonic states with respect to the atomic input
states; averaged over all six input states, it amounts to
92.4(3) %. It is instructive to investigate how the two ﬁg-
ures of merit behave as a function of the detection time
window, which is depicted in Fig. 5(c); the same ﬁgure
shows the trade-oﬀ between ﬁdelity and success proba-
bility of the interface. For the 450 ns time window, we
achieve 0.127(1) % mean photon detection eﬃciency. At
10 kHz repetition rate, we obtain 45(2) s−1 ﬁber-coupled
photons. The eﬃciency reduction compared to the previ-
ous measurement is caused by using diﬀerent wave plates
that are better calibrated but have smaller aperture. Re-
moving the wave plates and polarizer would thus allow
us to transfer the atomic qubit state onto ﬁber-coupled
photons at a rate of ∼ 300 s−1, similar to that estimated
for ion-photon entanglement.

by using also the bare input states |± 5

An important source of inﬁdelity for both ion-photon
entanglement and ion-to-photon quantum-state transfer
are magnetic-ﬁeld ﬂuctuations in the vicinity of the trap
apparatus that limit the coherence of the atomic qubit
state. We expect to mitigate this issue by means of
an active magnetic-ﬁeld stabilization. Additional minor
sources of inﬁdelity are detector dark counts (∼ 30 s−1)
and spontaneous decay from the P3/2 state back to D5/2
(with 5.87 % probability [32]).

Conclusions

In conclusion, we demonstrated a single-atom to single-
photon quantum interface that is programmable to serve
for bi-directional quantum-state transfer and generation
of atom-photon entanglement. Entangled ion-photon
pairs have been created at about 300 s−1 rate (entan-
gler operation). The reconstructed two-qubit state ex-
hibits 84.6(2) % ﬁdelity with respect to a maximally en-
tangled state. Using the same ingredients, we realized
ion-to-photon quantum-state transfer (sender operation):
an arbitrary atomic qubit state is mapped onto the po-
larization state of the output photon with 90.2(1.0) %
quantum-process ﬁdelity and 92.4(3) % mean quantum-
state ﬁdelity. Application of the same interface for her-
alded photon-to-atom quantum-state transfer (receiver
operation) had been shown earlier [26]. Finally, the con-
verter mode of operation of the interface provides single-
photon frequency conversion, with a single atom replac-
ing the conventional non-linear optical device [33, 34].
Our experimental implementation is based on a Raman
transition in a single 40Ca+ ion and is readily adapted
