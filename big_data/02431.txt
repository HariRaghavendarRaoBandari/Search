A theoretical model, which relates the binding energy of a positively charged exciton in a quantum
dot with the conﬁnement energy is presented. It is shown that the binding energy, deﬁned as the
energy diﬀerence between the corresponding charged and neutral complexes conﬁned on the same
excitonic shell strongly depends on the shell index. Moreover, it is shown that the ratio of the
binding energy for positively charged excitons from the p- and s-shells of a dot depends mainly on
the nearly perfect conﬁnement in the dot, which is due to the "hidden symmetry" of the multi-
electron-hole system. We applied the theory to the excitons conﬁned to a single GaAlAs/AlAs
quantum dots. The relevant binding energy was determined using the micro-photoluminescence and
micro-photoluminescence excitation magneto-spectroscopy. We show that within our theory, the
conﬁnement energy determined using the ratio of the binding energy corresponds well to the actual
conﬁnement energy of the investigated dot.

INTRODUCTION

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) provide a unique
environment to study fundamental properties of strongly
interacting charge carriers.1–3 The multitude of possible
eﬀects including direct and exchange Coulomb interac-
tions and the resulting conﬁguration mixing makes the
energy spectrum of the complexes a complicated func-
tion of the conﬁning potential and the relevant interac-
tions. Both factors which depend on the QD size, shape,
and composition must be taken into account to reliably
describe the energy spectrum of excitons. Substantial
eﬀorts have been put to relate the morphology to experi-
mentally addressable properties of carrier complexes con-
ﬁned in dots, i.e., the related photoluminescence (PL) -
which corresponds to emission or the photoluminescence
excitation (PLE) - which corresponds to the absorption of
light.4,5 Among them a concept of "inverse engineering",
which associates a speciﬁc order of emission lines due to
particular excitonic complexes with a speciﬁc structure
and composition of dots can be acknowledged.6 Going be-
yond the approach we have recently shown that in natural
InAs QDs the order results from a particular realization
of the atomic species distribution.7

The quest to relate some general properties of the QDs
conﬁning potential to the experimentally addressable fea-
tures of carrier complexes in the dots motivates also our
study. Our theoretical analysis shows that the ratio of
the binding energy (BE) of the positively charged exci-
tonic complexes related to the p- and s-shells of a strongly
conﬁned QD depends mainly on the conﬁnement energy
in the QD. We applied the model to our experimental
results conﬁrming its validity in the GaAlAs/AlAs QDs
formed in a GaAs/AlAs type-II bilayer.

We carried out the numerical calculations by exact
diagonalization of model Coulomb Hamiltonians of the
studied eh complexes (1e + 1h for the exciton and 1e + 2h
for the positively charged exciton). For simplicity, we
assumed that the QD conﬁnement is circular, strictly
two-dimensional (i.e., of zero thickness) and laterally
parabolic for both electrons and holes. Furthermore, we
have assumed equal e and h oscillator length scales (i.e.,
identical corresponding electron and hole orbitals), which
relies on nearly perfect (and thus spatially equal) conﬁne-
ment of both kinds of carriers inside the quantum dot;
within our simple model this is expressed by equal ra-
tios of electron and hole eﬀective masses and conﬁnement
frequencies (meωe=mhωh).8 The neutral and positively
charged exciton Hamiltonian matrices were expressed in
the eh conﬁguration bases, and we have only included
a small number of lowest electron and hole s-, p-, d-
,. . . oscillator shells. For the present context of study-
ing two particular optical transitions (between an exci-
ton and vacuum and between a charged exciton and the
hole in the s-shell), only the subspaces with vanishing to-
tal orbital angular momentum M=0 are important and
have been considered. For the charged exciton, the to-
tal two-hole spin (singlet vs. triplet) has been resolved
in the diagonalization procedure. Finally, for each ob-
tained neutral or charged exciton eigenstate we have also
computed the oscillator strength for the relevant optical
transition mentioned above: X↔vacuum and X+

↔hs.

Theoretically determined absorption spectra for the
neutral exciton as well as for the spin-singlet and the
spin-triplet positively charged excitons are shown in Fig.

and (d) 8 (s, p, d . . . ) electron and hole shells are included.
Grey and blue (red) peaks represent an emission related to
the neutral exciton and the singlet(triplet)-spin state of the
positively charged exciton, respectively. The horizontal blue
and red arrows indicate a magnitude of binding energy at the
s- and p-shell (∆ss and ∆pp), respectively.

ular choice of parameters: ωe=20 meV and ωh=4 meV
(i.e., ωe/ωh=mh/me=5) and in the absence of mag-
netic ﬁeld (B=0 T). All material parameters (i.e., di-
electric constant ǫ=12.5 and eﬀective mass of electron
me=0.067 m0) were taken appropriate for GaAs. The
Planck constant (¯h) is omitted here and in the following
considerations for the sake of clarity. In the zero-order
approximation only the electron-hole and the hole-hole
intra-shell Coulomb interactions were considered with
all inter-shell Coulomb scattering matrix elements ne-
glected. The results of such an approach are displayed
in Fig. 1(a). The spectra are identical for both com-
plexes, with few peaks corresponding to the promotion
of electrons from the successive s-, p-, d-, .
. valence
band shells to the corresponding conduction band shells.
The peaks related to the shells are spaced roughly by the
conﬁning energy ωe+ωh with oscillator strengths equal
to the shell degeneracies.

.

Figs 1(b)-(d) present the spectra obtained by including
all Coulomb matrix elements within 2, 3, and 8 electron
and hole shells. Clearly, already a simple two-shell model

captures the essential behavior. Besides the known re-
distribution of excitonic oscillator strength from higher
to lower peaks caused by inter-shell scattering, several
points need be noted about the trions: (i) Low-energy
absorption adding to an s-shell hole an eh pair on the
same, lowest s-shell only creates the spin-singlet charged
exciton (blue peaks, including one marked "ss"). In con-
trast, higher energy absorption adding an eh pair on
diﬀerent, higher shells predominantly creates the spin-
triplet charged exciton (red peaks, including one marked
"pp"). (ii) The energy diﬀerence ∆xx between the cor-
responding neutral and charged exciton peaks ("ss" and
"pp"), interpreted as binding energy of the an exciton
in diﬀerent x-shells to a hole in the lowest s-shell, is not
monotonic in the shell index x=s, p, d, . . . . While it does
decrease with increasing x=p, d, . . . , when absorption oc-
curs to a diﬀerent shell than that occupied by the initial
electron (x>s), forming a spin-triplet charged exciton, it
remains relatively low when absorption happens to the
same shell (x=s), and a spin-singlet charged exciton is
created. This exchange eﬀect is a consequence of the
(approximate) "hidden symmetry" in this system.8–11

In order to investigate further the eﬀect of quantum
conﬁnement on the optical spectra of the neutral and
positively charged excitons we performed the previously
shown analysis with 3 shells (compare Fig.1(c)) for a
broad range of the relevant parameters. To this end
we determined the ratio (R) of the BE of the positively
charged trions (R=∆pp/∆ss). The results of our calcu-
lations are illustrated in Fig. 2 in the form of a color-
coded contour plot) in intuitive ωe+ωh and ωe/ωh coor-
dinates. As it can be appreciated in Fig. 2 the ratio R
varies rather little throughout most of the map. Moreover
for the experimentally justiﬁed case of ωe/ωh>1 (cor-
responding to usual me/mh<1) the contours go almost

vertically in a broad range of the conﬁnement energies.
Particularly, in the case of ωe+ωh ≈24 meV, previously
described in Fig. 1, R=3.5 (see the white dashed line in
Fig. 2).

III. SAMPLE AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUPS

The active part of the structure used in our study was
intentionally designed as a GaAs/AlAs type-II bilayer
(dGaAs = 2.4 nm, dAlAs = 10 nm) embedded between
wide (100 nm) Ga0.67Al0.33As barriers.12,13 Previous re-
search showed that the bilayer is not perfect in the lateral
directions: the Ga-rich inclusions, which can be seen as
islands of Ga1−xAlxAs (x < 0.33) replacing the original
GaAs/AlAs bilayer, exist in this structure and possess all
attributes of relatively strongly conﬁned semiconductor
QDs. These dots show remarkably low surface density,
− 106 cm−2. Their emission spectra
at the level of 105
are dispersed in a wide energy range, 1.56-1.68 eV,14–20
due to the spread in the lateral extent of the conﬁning
potential.

Single dot measurements have been carried out at liq-
uid helium temperature using a typical setup for the PL
and PLE experiments. To detect the PL spectra, a tun-
able Ti:Sapphire laser was set at λ= 725 nm to assure
the quasi-resonant excitation conditions, i.e., to inject
the eh pairs directly into QDs.21 The PLE signal was ob-
tained from the measured variations in the intensity of
the emitted PL with changes of the excitation energy.

The setup was dedicated to measurements in an exter-
nal magnetic ﬁeld in the Faraday conﬁguration with the
aid of a superconducting magnet producing ﬁeld up to
9 T. The sample was located on top of an x-y-z piezo-
stage in a bath cryostat with an optical access provided
by a Y-shaped ﬁber equipped with a microscope objective
(spot size around 1 µm2).22 The laser light was coupled
to one branch of the Y-shaped ﬁber, focused by the mi-
croscope objective, and the signal was detected from the
second branch of the ﬁber, by a 0.5 m-long monochroma-
tor equipped with a charge-couple-device camera.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND

DISCUSSION

In order to experimentally verify the model and to ﬁnd
R for a particular QD, single-dot PL and PLE spectra
must be collected and analysed. Moreover, as it is shown
latter, the PLE measurements in magnetic ﬁeld need to
be performed in order to identify neural and positively
charged excitons from the p-shell of a single QD.

The BE of the positively charged exciton at the ground
s-shell (∆ss) is deﬁned as the energy diﬀerence between
the emission lines attributed to the singlet state of the

positively charged exciton (X+) and to the neutral ex-
citon (X). The results of polarization-sensitive PL mea-
surements on the investigated QD are shown in Fig. 3. It
was found that both the X and the 2X emission lines split
into two linearly-polarized components (the magnitude
of splitting was equal to about 23 µeV), which is charac-
teristic of neutral excitonic complexes. The excitation-
power dependent measurements conﬁrmed that the for-
mer line corresponds to recombination of a neutral ex-
citon (1es1hs) while the latter results from the optical
recombination of a neutral biexciton (2es2hs). The ﬁne
structure splitting of the neutral exciton and biexciton is
a consequence of the eh exchange interaction in the dot
characterized by anisotropic potential and it has been
intensively studied in the literature.23–27

The X+ line did not split, which is characteristic of a
charged exciton. The attribution of the line to the spin-
singlet state of a singly, positively charged exciton was a
topic of previous studies (Refs 19,28) and will not be dis-
cussed here. The complex consists of an s-shell electron
and two s-shell holes (1es2hs). There is no FSS of the
X+ line, because the eh exchange interaction inﬂuences
neither the initial (where the two holes form a closed
shell) nor the ﬁnal state (only one hole left).26 One must
note that the presence of the emission lines due to diﬀer-
ent charge states of a QD (neural and positively charged)
under quasi-resonant excitation is characteristic for spec-
tra measured over some time (5 s in our case) and results
from charge ﬂuctuations in the structure.18

The BE of the positively charged exciton at the s-shell
(of an s-shell exciton to the s-shell hole) determined from
the analysis for the investigated QD equals ∆ss ≈4 meV.
For the sake of completeness yet another emission line
(X+∗) present in the spectrum should be addressed. It
is ascribed to the spin-triplet state of a singly, positively
charged exciton and its ﬁne structure results from the
eh and hole-hole exchange interaction (see Ref. 28 for
details).

GaAlAs QD. The spectra are normalized to the most intense
peaks and shifted for clarity purpose.

More complicated is the determination of the BE of
the positively charged exciton at the p-shell (∆pp). The
BE is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the energies of the
triplet state of the positively charged exciton (1ep1hp1hs)
and to the neutral exciton in the excited state (1ep1hp).
Both states do not usually recombine radiatively due to
their fast relaxation to the spin-singlet of a positively
charged exciton and the ground state of the neutral ex-
citon. They should however contribute to the resonances
in the PLE spectra of the charged and neutral excitons
measured respectively at the X and X+ emission lines.
The PLE spectra are presented in Fig. 4.

There are several resonances in the spectra, which can
not be directly attributed to the sought excited states of
the neutral and positively charged excitons. It is not ob-
vious at the moment what is the origin of the multitude
of resonances. The symmetry breaking and the resulted
mixing with higher energy bands can be a possible origin
of the resonances,29 however no solid explanation of the
eﬀect can be proposed. As a plethora of resonances does
not facilitate their attribution to particular excitonic con-
ﬁgurations, we investigated their evolution in magnetic
ﬁeld applied in the Faraday conﬁguration. As it is known
from previous experiments on the investigated dots, sev-
eral shells (s-, p-, d-) are available to excitonic complexes
conﬁned in them. It is therefore reasonable to expect the
observation of the evolution in magnetic ﬁeld which is
related to the p-shell of a dot.30 The single-particle elec-
tronic state of a particle conﬁned in parabolic potential is
expected to follow the Fock-Darwin structure.31,32 Pre-
vious experiments on QDs shown that the characteristic
evolution is also reproduced by the energy structure of
the excitonic states.33 In particular the energy of a com-
plex relate to the excited states, which are of interest
to us, is supposed to lower its energy with magnetic ﬁeld
(which results from Zeeman interaction of the orbital mo-
mentum of the complex with magnetic ﬁeld). The results
of the measurements are shown in Fig. 5. As the energies
of the positively charged exciton (X+) and the neutral ex-
citon (X) shift diamagnetically in magnetic ﬁeld and split

4

due to Zeeman interaction, the energy scales in both Fig.
5(a) and Fig. 5(b) are relative to the energies of corre-
sponding ground state complexes.
In the following we
address both results.

The PLE spectra of the neutral exciton (see Fig. 5(a))
can be divided into two energy ranges: above and below
∼21 meV. In the low-energy range, all resonant peaks
show the same type of the magnetic ﬁeld evolution. Their
energies increase with magnetic ﬁeld which is characteris-
tic diamagnetic behaviour of carriers and complexes with
zero-orbital momentum. Such an evolution relates the
resonances to the s-shell of the investigated dot.30 We
can observed them at the relative energy higher than ap-
prox. 10 meV and the energy diﬀerence between them is
only around 1-2 meV. The observed resonance also split
in magnetic ﬁeld due to Zeeman spin- interaction. A
complicated picture of the splitting of particular reso-
nances observed in particular polarizations of the ground
state makes the full analysis of the eﬀect quite compli-
cated a task. However, a similar eﬀect of magnetic ﬁeld
on all those resonances can be observed we provisionally
relate them to resonances occurred between the excited
hole levels, e.g., the p-, d-,. . . shells, and the ground elec-
tron level, the s-shell.19,34,35 Such an attribution would
explain the diamagnetic shift of the resonances. At high
energies, the observed pattern of resonant peaks becomes
extremely complex and the peaks can be hardly followed
with the magnetic ﬁeld. In our opinion some additional
transitions involving phonon replicas can be responsible
for resonances in this energy range. Nevertheless there
are resonances observed in that energy range which lower
their energies with magnetic ﬁeld. The lowest-energy res-
onance of that behaviour can be appreciated following the
structure, which originates around ∼26 meV at B=0 T.
We ascribed this peak to the excited state of the neutral
exciton, labelled X∗ (1ep1hp), involving the absorption
of an electron from the p-shell level in the valence band
to the p-shell level in the conduction band.

In the case of magnetic-ﬁeld evolution of PLE spectra
of the charged exciton, presented in Fig. 5(b), there are
also two types of resonances: the s- and p-shell like. The
observation of the s-shell-like magnetic-ﬁeld dependence
might also be ascribed to the transitions between the ex-
cited hole levels, e.g., the p-, d-,. . . shells, and the ground
electron level, the s-shell, however, in the presence of
an additional hole.19,34,35 Moreover, the peak, appeared
around ∼15.5 meV at B=0 T, lowers its energy with the
magnetic ﬁeld. As a consequence this peak has been
attributed to the absorption process of excited state of
the positively charged exciton, labelled X∗+ (1ep1hp1hs),
which involve absorption process of an electron from the
p-shell level in the valence band to the p-shell level in
the conduction band in presence of an extra hole on the
s-shell (see Refs. 19,36 for details).

For the p-shell, we obtained that the BE of an p-shell
exciton to the s-shell hole is about ∆pp ≈10 meV for the
studied dot. Consequently, it was found that BE of the
positively charged exciton, deﬁned as the energy diﬀer-

ence between the charged and neutral complex occupying
the s- and p-shell levels, increases more than two times
from the p-shell to the s-shell complex (the ∆pp/∆ss ratio
equals about 2.5).

Our experimentally obtained value of the R ratio,
≈2.5, qualitatively agrees with the calculations of the
presented simpliﬁed model. Based on the description of
the GaAlAs/AlAs dots, discussed in Refs 15,19, we as-
sumed that the ωe+ωh value contains in the range 10 -
20 meV, while the ωe/ωh parameter is bigger than about
3. This situates these QDs in central-upper part of Fig.
Fig. 2, where the BE ratio changes from 3 to 4, which is
very close to the experimental value.

This result conﬁrms the validity of the proposed model
based on some very general assumptions related to basic
properties of electron-hole complexes in QDs.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We proposed a theoretical model, which described the
"shell" eﬀect on the binding energy (BE) of the positively
charged excitons. Our calculations showed that the BE
ratio remarkably remains almost constant over a broad

range of applied parameters. We performed PL and PLE
excitation measurements on the GaAs/AlGaAs QDs to
verify the validity of the model. We showed that ap-
plication of magnetic ﬁeld was necessary to identify the
excited states of both the neutral and positively charged
excitonic states. Based on experimental values of the BE
of the positively charged exciton we obtained a qualita-
tive agreement between the experimental results and the
predictions of our theory. Our results conﬁrm the rele-
vance of the applied model to the description of electron-
hole complexes in QDs.
