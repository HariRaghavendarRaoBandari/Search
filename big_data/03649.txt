A BLOCH-WIGNER EXACT SEQUENCE OVER LOCAL

RINGS

BEHROOZ MIRZAII

Abstract. In this article we extend the Bloch-Wigner exact sequence
over local rings, where their residue ﬁelds have more than nine elements.
Moreover, we prove Van der Kallen’s theorem on the presentation of the
second K-group of local rings such that their residue ﬁelds have more
than four elements. Note that Van der Kallen proved this result when
the residue ﬁelds have more than ﬁve elements. Although we prove our
results over local rings, all our proofs also work over semilocal rings
where all their residue ﬁelds have similar properties as the residue ﬁeld
of local rings.

Introduction

The Bloch-Wigner exact sequence studies the second and the third K-
groups of a ﬁeld. On the one hand, it gives Matsumoto’s theorem on the
presentation of the second K-group and on the other hand it gives a precise
description of the indecomposable part of the third K-group of the ﬁeld.

This result, proved by Bloch and Wigner independently and in somewhat

diﬀerent form, in one of its early forms gives the exact sequence

0 → Q/Z → H3(SL2(k), Z) → p(k) → k× ∧ k× → H2(SL2(k), Z) → 0,

where k is an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero [1], [3]. Here
p(k) is the pre-Bloch group of k, which is the free abelian group generated
by the symbols [a], a ∈ k× − {1} up to deﬁning relations

[a] − [b] +h b

ai −h1 − a−1

1 − bi
1 − b−1i +h 1 − a

and the map p(k) → k× ∧k× is given by [a] 7→ a∧(1−a). Moreover, the map
k× ∧ k× = H2(k×, Z) → H2(SL2(k), Z) is induce by the map k× → SL2(k),
a 7→ diag(a, a−1). For description of other maps involved in the above
sequence see [3, App. A].

Using the homology stability theorem for the general or special linear

groups of k, one can prove (see [14] or [9]) that

K2(k) ≃ H2(SL2(k), Z)

and K ind

3

(k) ≃ H3(SL2(k), Z).

Note that K ind
(k) is the indecomposable part of the third K-group of k,
which is the cockerel of the natural map from the third Milnor K-group

3 (k) to the third K-group K3(k). Therefore the Bloch-Wigner exact

K M
sequence ﬁnds the following form

0 → Q/Z → K ind

3

(k) → p(k) → k× ∧ k× → K2(k) → 0.

This exact sequence had many important applications and was the source
of many deep ideas in algebraic K-theory. Thus it was very important to
generalize it to a wider class of rings.
In a remarkable paper, Suslin has
generalized this exact sequence to all inﬁnite ﬁelds. In fact, he showed that
for any inﬁnite ﬁeld F we have the Bloch-Wigner exact sequence
(F ) → p(F ) → (F ×⊗ZF ×)σ → K2(F ) → 0,
0 → TorZ
where the group TorZ
1 (µ(F ), µ(F ))∼ is the unique nontrivial extension of
TorZ
1 (µ(F ), µ(F )) by Z/2 and (F × ⊗Z F ×)σ := F × ⊗Z F ×/ha ⊗ b + b ⊗ a :
a, b ∈ F ×i. In [6] Hutchinson showed that the above exact sequence also
holds over ﬁnite ﬁelds with more than three elements. His proof is diﬀerent
than Suslin’s original proof and only works for ﬁnite ﬁelds.

1 (µ(F ), µ(F ))∼ → K ind

This article should be seen as sequel to [10], [12], where a Bloch-Wigner
exact sequence has been proved over rings with many units, e.g.
local or
semilocal rings whose their residue ﬁelds are inﬁnite. In this article, we will
extend the Bloch-Wigner exact sequence over local rings, where their residue
ﬁelds have more than nine elements. But before proving this, we prove Van
der Kallen’s generalization of Matsumoto’s theorem on the presentation of
the second K-group of local rings.

More precisely, ﬁrst we prove that if R is a local ring with maximal ideal
mR and R/mR has more than four elements, then we have the exact sequence

p(R) → (R× ⊗Z R×)σ → K2(R) → 0.

This immediately implies that K2(R) ≃ K M
for us

2 (R) (Proposition 3.6), where

K M

2 (R) := R× ⊗Z R×/ha ⊗ (1 − a), b ⊗ (−b) | a, 1 − a, b ∈ R×i.

Note that when R/mR has more than ﬁve elements, the term b ⊗ (−b) can
be removed from the deﬁnition of K M

2 (R) (Lemma 1.5).

Furthermore, we prove a Bloch-Wigner exact sequence over local rings.
Let |R/mR| > 9 and |R/mR| 6= 16, 32. If R is a domain or is an algebra over
a ﬁeld we may only assume that |R/mR| > 9. Then we will prove that we
have the exact sequence

TR → K ind

3

(R) → p(R) → (R× ⊗Z R×)σ → K2(R) → 0,

where TR sits in the short exact sequence

0 → TorZ

1 (µ(R), µ(R))σ → TR → H1(Σ2, µ2∞(R) ⊗Z µ2∞(R)) → 0.

Moreover, if there is a homomorphism R → F , F a ﬁeld, such that the
map µ(R) → µ(F ) is injective, e.g. R is a domain, then we have the exact
sequence
0 → TorZ

(R) → p(R) → (R× ⊗Z R×)σ → K2(R) → 0,

1 (µ(R), µ(R))∼ → K ind

3

BLOCH-WIGNER THEOREM

where the composition TorZ
is induced by the map µ(R) → SL2(R), ξ 7→ diag(ξ, ξ−1).

1 (µ(R), µ(R)) → TorZ

1 (µ(R), µ(R))∼ → K ind

(R)

We also prove Hutchinson’s Bloch-Wigner exact sequence over ﬁnite ﬁelds
[6]. Let F be a ﬁnite ﬁled with at least four elements. Then we prove that
if F 6= F4, F8, then we have the exact sequence

0 → TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F ))∼ → H3(SL2(F ))F × → B(F ) → 0,

and if F = F4 or F8, then we have the exact sequence

0 → TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F )) ⊕ Z/2 → H3(SL2(F ))F × → B(F ) → 0,

where B(F ) is the Bloch group of F , i.e. B(F ) := ker(p(F ) → (F ×⊗ZF ×)σ).
Moreover, we show that if F 6= F4, F8, then H3(SL2(F ))F × ≃ K ind
(F ) and
if F = F4 or F8, then H3(SL2(F ))F × ≃ K ind
(F ) ⊕ Z/2 and thus we have the
Bloch-Wigner exact sequence

3

3

0 → TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F ))∼ → K ind

3

(F ) → B(F ) → 0.

For the proof of the above results we need certain strong homology sta-
bility results for the second and the third homology of general linear groups.
Although homology stability results with sharp stability bound is well-known
for general linear groups of local rings with inﬁnite residue ﬁelds [13], we
couldn’t ﬁnd such a results over local rings with ﬁnite residue ﬁelds.
In
Sections 3 and 4 we will prove certain stability results that are good enough
for our main applications (Theorems 3.2, 4.6).

It is worth to mention that almost all the results of this article are valid
if we replace the local ring R with a semilocal ring such that all its residue
ﬁelds has the same property that R/mR has.

In this paper we shall assume throughout that R is a commutative local
ring with maximal ideal mR unless explicitly stated to the contrary. More-
over by the homology group Hn(G) we will mean the homology of the group
G with integral coeﬃcients, i.e. Hn(G) := Hn(G, Z).

1. The main spectral sequence

Let R be a commutative local ring with maximal ideal mR. Let Cl(R2) be
the free abelian group generated by the set of all (l+1)-tuples (hv0i, . . . , hvli),
where every vi ∈ R2 is a basis of a direct summand of R2 and any two disjoint
vectors vi, vj are a basis of R2. We consider Cl(R2) as a left GL2(R)-module
in a natural way. If necessary, we convert this action to a right action by
the deﬁnition m.g := g−1m. Let us deﬁne the l-th diﬀerential operator

∂l : Cl(R2) → Cl−1(R2),

l ≥ 1,

as an alternating sum of face operators which throws away the i-th compo-
nent of generators. Hence we have the complex
∂2−→ C1(R2)

∂1−→ C0(R2) → 0.

· · · −→ C2(R2)

Let ∂−1 = ǫ : C0(R2) → Z be deﬁned byPi ni(hv0,ii) 7→Pi ni. It is easy to

see that C1(R2) → C0(R2) → Z → 0 is exact and thus H0(C•(R2)) = Z.

C•(R2) :

4

BEHROOZ MIRZAII

Let G be a group and L• a complex of left G-modules:

L• :

· · · → L2 → L1 → L0 → 0.

The n-th homology of G with coeﬃcient in L•, denoted by

Hn(G, L•),

is deﬁned as the n-th homology of the total complex of the double complex
C•(G) ⊗G L•, where C•(G) → Z is the standard resolution of G. This double
complex induces two spectral sequences

and

E2
p,q(G) = Hp(G, Hq(L•)) ⇒ Hp+q(G, L•),

E1

p,q(G) = Hq(G, Lp) ⇒ Hp+q(G, L•),

(see [2, §5, Chap. VII]).

Lemma 1.1. Let the complex L• be exact for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and M = H0(L•).
Then Hi(G, L•) ≃ Hi(G, M ) for 0 ≤ i ≤ n.

Proof. This follows from an easy analysis of the spectral sequence E2

p,q(G).
(cid:3)

From the complex C•(R2) of GL2(R)-modules we obtain the ﬁrst quadrant

spectral sequence

E1

p,q := E1

p,q(GL2(R)) = Hq(GL2(R), Cp(R2)) ⇒ Hp+q(GL2(R), C•(R2)).

In this section we will study this spectral sequence for small values of p and
q.

Lemma 1.2 (Hutchinson). The complex C•(R2) is exact for 1 ≤ i < |R/mR|
and H0(C•(R2)) ≃ Z.

Proof. See [7, Lemma 3.21].

(cid:3)

For simplicity, in the rest of this section we will assume

∞ := he1i, 0 := he2i, 1 := he1 + e2i, b−1 := he1 + be2i, b ∈ R×.

Since GL2(R) acts transitively on the sets of generators of Ci(R2) for i =
0, 1, 2, by the Shapiro lemma we have

E1
E1
E1

0,q ≃ Hq(StabGL2(R)(∞)) = Hq(B2),
1,q ≃ Hq(StabGL2(R)(∞, 0)) = Hq(T2),
2,q ≃ Hq(StabGL2(R)(∞, 0, 1)) = Hq(R×),

0

where B2 :=(cid:18)R× R

0 R×(cid:19) and T2 :=(cid:18)R×

0 R×(cid:19) ≃ R× × R×. Moreover, the

orbits of the action of GL2(R) on C3(R2) and C4(R2) are given by the frames

BLOCH-WIGNER THEOREM

p(a) := (∞, 0, 1, a−1), and q(a, b) := (∞, 0, 1, a−1, b−1), respectively, where
a, 1 − a, b, 1 − b, a − b ∈ R×. Therefore

E1
E1

3,q ≃La∈A Hq(R×).p(a),
4,q ≃L(a,b)∈B Hq(R×).q(a, b),

where A := {a ∈ R : a, 1 − a ∈ R×} and B := {(a, b) ∈ R2 : a, 1 − a, b, 1 −
b, a − b ∈ R×}.

If N2 := (cid:18)1 R

0

1(cid:19) ⊆ B2 = (cid:18)R× R

0 R×(cid:19), then B2 = N2 ⋊ T2 ≃ R ⋊ T2,

where the action of T2 on R is given by (a, b).x := ab−1x. This clearly
implies that for any n ≥ 0,

Hn(B2) ≃ Hn(T2) ⊕ An,

where An is the kernel of Hn(B2) → Hn(T2) which is induced by the natural
surjective map B2 → T2.

Lemma 1.3. If |R/mR| 6= 2, then H1(B2) ≃ H1(T2), H2(B2) ≃ H2(T2) ⊕
H2(R)R× and H3(B2) ≃ H3(T2) ⊕ A3, where A3 sits in the exact sequence

H2(T2, H2(R)) → H3(R)R× → A3 → H1(T2, H2(R)) → 0.

Here the action of R× on Hi(R) is induced by the natural action of R× on
R, i.e. a.r := ar.

Proof. From the extension 0 → R → B2 → T2 → 1, we obtain the Lyndon-
Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence

E 2
r,s = Hr(T2, Hs(R)) ⇒ Hr+s(B2).

Since R/mR has at least three elements, there is a ∈ R× such that a−1 ∈ R×.
Then

H0(T2, H1(R)) = H0(T2, R) = R/ha − 1 : a ∈ R×i = 0,

and so by Lemma 1.4 below (for ϕ : T2 → R×, (a, b) 7→ ab−1), for any r ≥ 0,
we have E 2
r,1 = Hr(T2, H1(R)) = 0. Now by an easy analysis of the above
spectral sequence we obtain the desired results.
(cid:3)

Lemma 1.4 (Suslin). Let G be an abelian group, A a commutative ring, M
an A-module and ϕ : G → A× a homomorphism of groups which turns A and
M into G-modules. If H0(G, A) = 0, then for any n ≥ 0, Hn(G, M ) = 0.

Proof. See [13, Lemma 1.8].

(cid:3)

The pre-Bloch group p(R) of a commutative ring R is the quotient of the
free abelian group Q(R) generated by symbols [a], a, 1 − a ∈ R×, by the
subgroup generated by elements of the form

[a] − [b] +h b

ai −h 1 − a−1

1 − bi,
1 − b−1i +h 1 − a

6

BEHROOZ MIRZAII

where a, 1 − a, b, 1 − b, a − b ∈ R×. Let the map λ : Q(R) → R× ⊗ R× be
deﬁned by [a] 7→ a ⊗ (1 − a). Then by a direct computation we have

λ(cid:0)[a] − [b] +h b

ai −h 1 − a−1

1 − b−1i +h 1 − a

1 − bi(cid:1) = a ⊗(cid:16) 1 − a

1 − b(cid:17) +(cid:16) 1 − a

1 − b(cid:17) ⊗ a.

Let

(R× ⊗ R×)σ := R× ⊗ R×/hc ⊗ d + c ⊗ d : c, d ∈ R×i.

We denote the elements of p(R) and (R× ⊗ R×)σ represented by [a] and
a ⊗ b again by [a] and a ⊗ b, respectively. Thus we have the well-deﬁned
map, denoted again by λ,

λ : p(R) → (R× ⊗ R×)σ,

[a] 7→ a ⊗ (1 − a).

The kernel of λ is called the Bloch group of R and is denoted by B(R). Thus
we obtain the exact sequence

0 → B(R) → p(R) → (R× ⊗ R×)σ → K M S

2

(R) → 0,

where

K M S

2

(R) := R× ⊗ R×/ha ⊗ (1 − a), b ⊗ c + c ⊗ b : a, 1 − a, b, c ∈ R×i.

The n-th Milnor K-group of a commutative ring R is deﬁned as the
n (R) generated by symbols {a1, . . . , an}, ai ∈ R×, i =

abelian group K M
1, . . . , n, subject to the following relations

(i) {a1, . . . , aia′

i, . . . , an}, any i,
(ii) {a1, . . . , an} = 0 if there exist i, j, i 6= j, such that ai + aj = 0 or 1.

i, . . . , an} = {a1, . . . , ai, . . . , an}+{a1, . . . , a′

Clearly we have the anti-commutative product map

K M

m (R) ⊗Z K M

n (R) → K M

m+n(R),

{a1, . . . , am} ⊗ {b1, . . . , bn} 7→ {a1, . . . , am, b1, . . . , bm}.

Since in R× ⊗ R× we have b ⊗ c + c ⊗ b = bc ⊗ (−bc) − b ⊗ (−b) − c ⊗ (−c),
the natural map K M S

(R) → K M

2 (R) is surjective.

Lemma 1.5. (i) Let R be either a ﬁeld or a local ring with |R/mR| 6= 2.
Then K M

(R).

2 (R) ≃ K M S

2

(ii) Let R be either a ﬁeld or a local ring with |R/mR| > 5. Then

K M

2 (R) ≃ R× ⊗ R×/ha ⊗ (1 − a) : a, 1 − a ∈ R×i.

In particular, K M
the elements a1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ an such that there are i, j, i 6= j, with ai + aj = 1.

Z R×(cid:1)/T , where T is the subgroup generated by

n (R) ≃(cid:0)Nn

Proof. (i) We denote the element of K M S
(R) represented by a ⊗ b, by
{a, b}M S . Thus it is suﬃcient to prove that for any a ∈ R×, {a, −a}M S = 0.
If 1 − a ∈ R×, then −a = (1 − a)/(1 − a−1) and so

2

{a, −a}M S = {a, 1 − a}M S − {a, 1 − a−1}M S = {a−1, 1 − a−1}M S = 0.

BLOCH-WIGNER THEOREM

7

This covers the case of ﬁelds. Let R be local and 1 − a /∈ R×. Since
|R/mR| 6= 2, there is always c ∈ R× such that c, 1 − c, 1 − ac ∈ R×. Then
by the above argument {c, −c}M S = {ac, −ac}M S = 0 and thus

{a, −a}M S = {ac, −ac}M S − {c, −c}M S − {a, c}M S − {c, a}M S = 0.

(ii) This can be done as Steps 1-5 in the proof of [18, Theorem 8.4].

(cid:3)

Now let |R/mR| 6= 2. Then by Lemmas 1.2 and 1.1, for n = 0, 1, 2 we

have

Hn(GL2(R), C•(R2)) ≃ Hn(GL2(R)).

If |R/mR| 6= 2, 3, then we also have the above isomorphism for n = 3.

Now we study the diﬀerentials of the spectral sequence E1

p,q for small

values of p and q. It is not diﬃcult to see that

d1
1,q = Hq(σ) − Hq(σ′),

where σ, σ′
diag(a, b). Moreover,

: T2 → B2 are given by σ(a, b) = diag(b, a) and σ′(a, b) =

d1
2,q = Hq(∆),

where ∆ : R× → T2 is the diagonal map a 7→ (a, a). Hence d1
2,q always is
injective. On the other hand, by a direct computation one can show that
for any z ∈ Hq(R×),

d1

3,q(cid:0)z.p(a)(cid:1) = 0

and

d1

4,q(cid:0)z.q(a, b)(cid:1) = z.(cid:16)p(a) − p(b) + p(cid:16) b

a(cid:17) − p(cid:16) 1 − a−1

1 − b(cid:17)(cid:17).
1 − b−1(cid:17) + p(cid:16) 1 − a

Putting all these together, the E2-terms of our spectral sequence look as
follow:

∗

H3(T2)σ ⊕ A3

H3(T2)σ/H3(R×) 0

H2(T2)σ ⊕ H2(R)R×

For an arbitrary group G, let C•(G)

standard and the (left) bar resolution of G, respectively. We turn Cn(G) and
Bn(G) into a right G-module in usual way. Note that the map

Lemma 1.6. Let H be a subgroup of G. Let θ : G/H → G be any (set
theoretic) section of the natural map (of sets) π : G → G/H, g 7→ gH.
g. Then the map Cn(G) → Cn(H) given
by (g0, . . . , gn) 7→ (g0, . . . , gn) induces an H-morphism of the standard com-
plexes C•(G) → C•(H) and for any n, the homomorphism

For g ∈ G, let g := (cid:0)θ ◦ π(g)(cid:1)−1

Hn(H) = Hn(C•(G)H ) → Hn(C•(H)H ) = Hn(H)

coincides with the identity map idHn(H).
Proof. This is easy to prove. In fact this map can be seen as the inverse of
the identity homomorphism

Hn(H) = Hn(C•(H)H ) → Hn(C•(G)H ) = Hn(H)

induced by the inclusion of H in G.

c(g1, g2, . . . , gn) := Xσ∈Σn

where Σn is the symmetric group of degree n. In fact, c(g1, g2, . . . , gn) is the
image of g1 ∧ · · · ∧ gn under the composition

Z A → Hn(A) → Hn(G),

where A is the abelian subgroup of G generated by g1, . . . , gn and the ﬁrst

standard resolution of Z over B2. By Lemma 1.6, an augmented preserving
chain map of B2-resolutions

F• = C•(GL2(R)) → C•(B2)

Now if g := (s ◦ π(g))−1g, then we have

where L = h(cid:0)a ∧ (1 − a), −a ⊗ (1 − a), −2c(a, 1 − a)(cid:1)|a, 1 − a ∈ R×i. Let
T :=(cid:0)H2(R×) ⊕ (R× ⊗ R×)σ ⊕ H2(R)R×(cid:1)/L. From the maps
(cid:0)(R×⊗R×)σ ⊕ H2(R)R×(cid:1)/K → T,
T →(cid:0)(R× ⊗ R×)σ ⊕ H2(R)R×(cid:1)/K,
we obtain the isomorphism T ≃ H2(GL1(R))⊕(cid:0)(R× ⊗R×)σ ⊕H2(R)R×(cid:1)/K.

(ii) Since |R/mR| ≥ 4, H1(SL2(R)) = 0. Then from the corresponding

2. Homology of affine groups

Lemma 1.3 shows that the groups Hi(R×, Hm(Rn, Z)) are important in
the study of the homology of aﬃne groups. They already have been studies
by Nesterenko and Suslin [16], [13] over local rings with inﬁnite residue ﬁeld
and by Hutchinson [6], [7] over a large class of local rings.

Proposition 2.1. Let R be a local ring. If R/mR is ﬁnite of order pd, we
suppose that 1 ≤ m < (p − 1)d.

(i) If m = 1 or m = 2, then for any r ≥ 0, Hr(R×, Hm(Rn, Z)) = 0.
(ii) For any prime ﬁeld k and any r ≥ 0, Hr(R×, Hm(Rn, k)) = 0.
(iii) If R is a domain or an algebra over a ﬁeld, then for any r ≥ 0,

Hr(R×, Hm(Rn, Z)) = 0.

Proof. Part (i) follows directly from Lemma [7, Lemma 3.17]. The proof of
(ii) is similar to the proof of [13, Proposition 1.10] or [16, Proposition 1.7].
For (iii) see [7, Lemma 3.18].
In fact, Hutchinson proved (iii) for local
domains, but his arguments also works for local algebras over ﬁelds.
(cid:3)

Let Gm(R) be a subgroup of GLm(R) and Gn(R) a subgroup of GLn(R)
and assume that either R×Im ⊆ Gm(R) or R×In ⊆ Gn(R). Let M (R) be a
free submodule of Mm,n(R) such that Gm(R)M (R) = M (R) = M (R)Gn(R).

Gn(R)(cid:19) is a subgroup of the aﬃne group

BLOCH-WIGNER THEOREM

Proposition 2.2. Let R be a local ring. If R/mR is ﬁnite, we assume that
it is of order pd. Let the natural homomorphism

φq : Hq(Gm(R) × Gn(R)) → Hq(Am,n(R))

be induced by the inclusion Gm(R) × Gn(R) → Am,n(R).

(i) For 0 ≤ q ≤ 2, φq is an isomorphism if q < p− 1)d. So φ0 always is an
isomorphism, φ1 is an isomorphism if |R/mR| 6= 2 and φ2 is an isomorphism
if |R/mR| 6= 2, 3, 4.

(ii) If R is a domain or an algebra over a ﬁeld, then φq is an isomorphism

for 0 ≤ q < (p − 1)d.

(iii) The map φq is an isomorphism for 0 ≤ q < (p−1)d−2. In particular,

if R/mR is inﬁnite, then φq is an isomorphism for any q.

Proof. This can be done as the proof of [16, Theorem 1.9]. For (iii) we also
need the next lemma.
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.3. Let f : H → G be a homomorphism of groups and let n be
a positive integer. If Hi(f ) : Hi(H, k) → Hi(G, k) is an isomorphism for
any 0 ≤ i ≤ n, and any prime ﬁeld k, then Hi(f ) : Hi(H) → Hi(G) is an
isomorphism for any 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 2.

Proof. Let p be a prime. Then from the long exact sequence of the homology
of H and G applied to 0 → Z/pd−1 → Z/pd → Z/p → 0 and by induction
on d, we see that Hi(H, Z/pd) → Hi(G, Z/pd) is an isomorphism for any
0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and any d ≥ 1. This together with the fact that Q/Z ≃
Z/pd, imply that Hi(H, Q/Z) → Hi(G, Q/Z) is an isomorphism
for any 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Now by applying a similar method to the exact
sequence 0 → Z → Q → Q/Z → 0, we see that Hi(H, Z) → Hi(G, Z) is an
isomorphism for any 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 2.

Example 2.4. Let B2(Fq) and T2(Fq) denote B2 and T2 over the ﬁnite ﬁeld
R = Fq. If q 6= 2, 3, 4, 8, then by Proposition 2.2, Hi(B2(Fq)) ≃ Hi(T2(Fq))
for 0 ≤ i ≤ 3. In this example we will discuss these groups when q = 2, 3, 4, 8.
Note that

H2(Fq) ≃V2

and H3(Fq) ≃V3

Z Fq ⊕ (Fq ⊗ Fq)−σ,

where −σ(a ⊗ b) = b ⊗ a (see [17, Lemma 5.5], [6, p. 38]).

(i) R = F2: In this case B2(F2) ≃ Z/2 and T2(F2) = {1}. Thus

H1(B2(F2)) ≃ H1(T2(F2)) ⊕ Z/2, H2(B2(F2)) ≃ H2(T2(F2))

and

H3(B2(F2)) ≃ H3(T2(F2)) ⊕ Z/2.

(ii) R = F3: Since H2(F3) = 0, for any r ≥ 0 we have E 2

r,2 = 0, where
this spectral sequence was discussed in the proof of Lemma 1.3. Moreover,
H3(F3) ≃ (F3 ⊗ F3)−σ = {0, 1 ⊗ 1, 1 ⊗ 2} and by a direct computation we
see that the action of F×

H1(B2(F3)) ≃ H1(T2(F3)), H2(B2(F3)) ≃ H2(T2(F3))

and

H3(B2(F3)) ≃ H3(T2(F3)) ⊕ Z/3.

(iii) R = F4: Clearly H2(F4) ≃V2

≃ Z/2.
These show that the action of T2(F4) on H2(F4) is trivial. Thus using the
Universal Coeﬃcient Theorem one can show that E 2
2,2 are trivial.
By applying the K¨unneth formula to (F4, +) ≃ Z/2 ⊕ Z/2, one sees that
H3(F4) has 8 elements. Thus if F4 = {0, 1, α, α + 1 | α2 = α + 1}, then

Z F4 ≃ Z/2 and thus H2(F4)F×

1 ⊗ 1 + α ⊗ α + 1 ⊗ α + α ⊗ 1}.

Now by a direct calculation we have H3(F4)F×
Finally from the spectral sequence E 2

H1(B2(F4)) ≃ H1(T2(F4)), H2(B2(F4)) ≃ H2(T2(F4)) ⊕ Z/2

and

H3(B2(F4)) ≃ H3(T2(F4)) ⊕ Z/2.

(iv) R = F8: Here we need to compute H3(F8)F×

. We have

H3(F8) ≃V3

Z F8 ⊕ (F8 ⊗ F8)−σ ≃ Z/2 ⊕ (F8 ⊗ F8)−σ.

Again using the K¨unneth formula one sees that H3(F8) has 27 elements.
Thus (F8 ⊗ F8)−σ has 26 elements. If we assume

F8 = {0, 1, α, α + 1, α2, α2 + 1, α2 + α, α2 + α + 1 | α3 = α + 1},

then

(F8 ⊗ F8)−σ = h1 ⊗ 1, α ⊗ α, α2 ⊗ α2, 1 ⊗ α + α ⊗ 1, 1 ⊗ α2 + α2 ⊗ 1,

α2 ⊗ α + α ⊗ α2i.

Now by a direct computation one sees that(cid:0)(F8 ⊗ F8)−σ(cid:1)F×

≃ Z/2 and hence

H3(F8)F×

= 0. Therefore

H1(B2(F8)) ≃ H1(T2(F8)), H2(B2(F8)) ≃ H2(T2(F8))

H3(B2(F8)) ≃ H3(T2(F8)) ⊕ Z/2.

Example 2.5. Let R = Fq be the ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements. If q ≥ 5, then by

Corollary 1.8 and Proposition 2.1 we have H2(SL2(Fq))F×

looking at the associated Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence E′′2
p,q
of the extension

1 → A3 → Σ3 → Σ3/A3 → 1,

for any pair (p, q) = (p, 2s) or (p, q) = (2r, 0), we have E′′2
p,q = 0. Since
the action of Σ3/A3 on A3 is non-trivial, E′′2
0,1 = H0(Σ3/A3, A3) = 0. Thus
by Lemma 2.6 below, E′′2
p,1 = Hp(Σ3/A3, A3) = 0 for all p ≥ 0. An easy
analysis of the above spectral sequence implies that H1(SL2(F2)) ≃ Z/2,
H2(SL2(F2)) = 0. Therefore,

Lemma 2.6. Let G be an abelian group and M a ﬁnitely generated G-module
such that H0(G, M ) = 0. Then for any n ≥ 0, Hn(G, M ) = 0.

Proof. See [4, p. 11–12].

(cid:3)

For a subgroup H of a group G and a G-module M , the natural map

Hn(H, M ) → Hn(G, M ) is called the corestriction map and is denoted by

corH

G : Hn(H, M ) → Hn(G, M ).

When the index of H in G is ﬁnite, i.e. [G : H] ≤ ∞, for any n ≥ 0 there is
a restriction map, called transfer map,

resG

H : Hn(G, M ) → Hn(H, M ),

such that

corH

G ◦ resG

H = [G : H]idHn(G,M ),

[2, Proposition 9.5, Chap. III].

In case G is ﬁnite, by putting H = {1}, one sees that Hn(G, M ) is anni-
hilated by |G| for all n > 0 [2, Corollary 10.2, Chap. III]. It is well known
that when M is a ﬁnitely generated G-module, then Hn(G, M ) is ﬁnite for
all n > 0.

Let G be a ﬁnite group. For a g ∈ G, let Hn(H) → Hn(gHg−1), z 7→ g.z,
be induced by the natural map H → gHg−1. We say z ∈ Hn(H) is g-
invariant if

resH

H∩gHg−1(z) = resgHg−1

H∩gHg−1(g.z).

Let

invG(Hn(H)) :=(cid:8)z ∈ Hn(H) | z is g-invarinat for all g ∈ G(cid:9).

18

BEHROOZ MIRZAII

If H is a p-Sylow subgroup of G, then one can show that

Hn(G)(p) ≃ invG(Hn(H)),

where Hn(G)(p) is the p-primary component of Hn(G) [2, Theorem 10.3,
Chap. III]. Moreover, if H is normal in G, then

Hn(G)(p) ≃ invG(Hn(H)) ≃ Hn(H)G/H .

For g ∈ G and z ∈ Hn(H) the condition resH
H∩gHg−1(g.z)
is trivially satisﬁed if H ∩ gHg−1 = 1. Thus to determine invG(Hn(H)) for
a p-Sylow subgroup H, it is enough to consider only the set Conj(G, H) of
those elements g for which H ∩ gHg−1 6= 1:

H∩gHg−1(z) = resgHg−1

Conj(G, H) := {g ∈ G | H ∩ gHg−1 6= 1}.

Example 2.7. Let F = Fpm, where p is a prime. Let N2(F ) =(cid:18)1 F

Then N2(F ) is a p-Sylow subgroup of GL2(F ). It is easy to see that A ∈
Conj(GL2(F ), N2(F )) if and only if A ∈ B2(F ). Thus

1(cid:19) ≃ F .

0

Conj(GL2(F ), N2(F )) = B2(F ) = Conj(B2(F ), N2(F )),

and hence

H3(GL2(F ))(p) ≃ invGL2(F )(H3(N2(F )))

= invB2(F )(H3(N2(F ))) ≃ H3(B2(F ))(p).

Now by Example 2.4, we have

H3(GL2(Fpm))(p) =(Z/p if pm = 2, 3, 4, 8

where zl ∈ Dl−1({x0, . . . , xl}) = 0 and thus zl = 0. From the above formula

The last claim follows from the fact that |P2(k)| ≥ |P2(F2)| = 7.

we have b∂l−1(y) + (−1)lz = 0 for some y and therefore b∂l((−1)l−1y) = z.
Set bLl := bCl−1(R3) for l ≥ 0 and consider the complex

and by the Universal Coeﬃcient Theorem,

H2(R× × GL2(R)) ≃ H2(R×) ⊕ H2(GL2(R)) ⊕ R× ⊗ H1(GL2(R)),
H2(R×2 × GL1(R)) ≃ H2(R×) ⊕ H2(R×) ⊕ H2(GL1(R)) ⊕ R× ⊗ R×

⊕ R× ⊗ H1(GL1(R)) ⊕ R× ⊗ H1(GL1(R))

If x ∈ ker(cid:0)H2(GL2(R)) → H2(GL3(R))(cid:1), then

(0, x, 0) ∈ ker(cid:0)inc∗ : H2(R× × GL2(R)) → H2(GL3(R))(cid:1).

Thus there is

z = (c(a1, b1), c(a2, b2), x′, a ⊗ b, c ⊗ d, e ⊗ f ) ∈ H2(R×2 × GL1(R))

such that (α∗ − inc∗)(z) = (0, x, 0) and so

0 = − c(a1, b1) + c(a2, b2),
x = + c(diag(a1, 1), diag(b1, 1)) − c(diag(a2, 1), diag(b2, 1))

+ c(diag(c, 1), diag(1, d)) − c(diag(e, 1), diag(1, f )),

0 = − b ⊗ a − a ⊗ b − c ⊗ d + e ⊗ f.

All these imply that

x = −c(diag(b, 1), diag(1, a)) − c(diag(a, 1), diag(1, b)) = 0.

(ii) Since |R/mR| ≥ 5, Proposition 2.1 implies that H2(R)R× = 0. Thus

by Corollary 1.8 and Lemma 1.5 we have

H2(GL2(R)) ≃ H2(GL1(R)) ⊕ K M

2 (R).

Now by the homology stability result from (i), we have

K M

2 (R) ≃ H2(GL2(R))/H2(GL1(R))
≃ H2(GL(R))/H2(GL1(R))
≃ H2(SL(R))
= K2(R).

Moreover, clearly K M

2 (R) → H2(GL2(R)) coincides with the composition
K M

2 (R) → H2(T2) → H2(GL2(R))

and by the proof of Corollary 1.8, this is given by

BLOCH-WIGNER THEOREM

Example 3.7. Since H2(GL2(F4)) ≃ Z/2 (see Example 2.5) and

H2(GL(F4)) ≃ H2(GL1(F4)) ⊕ K2(F4) = 0,

the natural map H2(GL2(F4)) → H2(GL(F4)) is surjective but not injective.
But K M

2 (F4) = K2(F4) = 0.

Remark 3.8. (i) Dennis has proved that for any local ring R the natural map
K M
2 (R) → K2(R) is surjective [15, Theorem 2.5]. His result also is true for
any semilocal ring which has at most one residue ﬁeld with two elements.

(ii) It is a result of Van der Kallen that K M

2 (R) → K2(R) is an iso-
morphism for any local ring such that its residue ﬁeld has more than ﬁve
elements. In fact, he proved this for a larger class of rings called 5-fold stable
rings [18, 5.2].

4. Stability for the third homology group and the third

K-group

To prove the Bloch-Wigner exact sequence we will need to show that the
map H3(GL3(R)) → H3(GL4(R)) is an isomorphism. We prove this when
the residue ﬁeld of R has suﬃcient elements.

Let S = {w1, . . . , wm} be a subset of Rn. We say that (v1, . . . , vl) is in
general position with S if for all ai ∈ R, i = 1, . . . , l + m and only n many
of them non-vanishing,

a1v1 + · · · + alvl + al+1w1 + · · · + al+mwm = 0

implies that ai = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , l.

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let cn(R) be the minimum of the numbers |S| where S is
a ﬁnite subset of Rn such that there is no further element in Rn which is in
general position to S.

Remark 4.2. We believe that cn(R) is equal to the largest natural number
such that there is a ﬁnite subset T of Rn such that the element of T are in
general position. This can be seen by direct calculations for local rings with
small residue ﬁelds.

Example 4.3. If v1, . . . , vn, vn+1, . . . , vl ∈ Rn are in general position, then
by multiplying the above vectors with a suitable invertible matrix we may
assume that v1 = e1, . . . , vn = en. Thus vn+1 = a1e1 + · · · + anen, where for
any i, ai 6= 0. Replacing ei with aiei for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and multiplying them
with a suitable invertible matrix, we may assume that v1 = e1, . . . , vn =
en, vn+1 = e1 + · · · + en. Moreover, in a similar way we may assume that
vn+j = e1 + a2,je2 + · · · + an,jen for 2 ≤ j ≤ l − n.

(i) The elements of the set {e1, e2, e1 + e2, e1 + aie2| i = 1, . . . , m} ⊆ R2
are in general position if and only if ai, 1 − ai, ai − aj ∈ R×, where i 6= j.
Thus

c2(R) = |P1(R/mR)| = |R/mR| + 1.

24

BEHROOZ MIRZAII

(ii) The above argument shows that cn(R) ≥ n + 1. If |R/mR| ≤ n, then

clearly cn(R) = n + 1.

(iii) If |R/mR| = ∞, then it is not diﬃcult to show that for any ﬁnite set
S of elements in general position of Rn, one can always ﬁnd many vectors
that are in general position with S. Therefore cn(R) = ∞.

(iv) The elements of the set

{e1, e2, e3, e1 + e2 + e3, e1 + aie2 + bie3 | i = 1, . . . , m} ⊆ R3

are in general position if and only if

ai, 1−ai, bi, 1−bi, ai −aj, bi −bj, ai −bi, xij := aibj −ajbi, xij −xik +xjk ∈ R×,

where i, j, k are distinct. By direct computations we get

4 if |R/mR| = 2, 3
6 if |R/mR| = 4, 5
8 if |R/mR| = 7, 8, 9

if |R/mR| > 9.

c3(R) =
c4(R) =(5

c3(R) ≥ 9

if |R/mR| = 2, 3, 4
if |R/mR| = 5

8

c4(R) ≥ 9

if |R/mR| ≥ 7.

Note that in F4
7, the elements of the set {e1, e2, e3, e4, e1 + e2 + e3 + e4, e1 +
2e2 + 3e3 + 4e4, e1 + 5e2 + 6e3 + 2e4, e1 + 3e2 + 4e3 + 5e4, e1 + 6e2 + 2e3 + 3e4}
are in general position.

For a non-negative integer l, let ˜Cl(Rn) be the free abelian group with a
basis consisting of (l + 1)-tuples (v0, . . . , vl), where vi ∈ Rn − {0} and for
any k ≤ l + 1, the submodule of Rn generated by any k elements of the set
{v0, . . . , vl} is a free summand of Rn. We deﬁne the diﬀerential operators
˜∂l : ˜Cl(Rn) → ˜Cl−1(Rn), l ≥ 0, in the usual way and consider ˜Cl(Rn) as a
left GLn(R)-module in a natural way. Note that ˜C−1(Rn) := Z. So we have
the complex of GLn(R)-modules:

˜C•(Rn) :

· · · → ˜C2(Rn) → ˜C1(Rn) → ˜C0(Rn) → ˜C−1(Rn) → 0.

For a ﬁnite subset S of Rn, let ˜C•(Rn, S) be the subcomplex of ˜C•(Rn),
where ˜Cl(Rn, S) is the free abelian group generated by terms (v0, . . . , vl)
which are in general position with S. Note that ˜C−1(Rn, S) = Z and
˜C•(Rn, ∅) = ˜C•(Rn).

Lemma 4.4. For a ﬁnite subset S of Rn, the complex ˜C•(Rn, S) is exact
In particular, ˜C•(Rn) is exact for
for −1 ≤ m ≤ (cn(R) − |S| − 3)/2.
−1 ≤ m ≤ (cn(R) − 3)/2. If R is a ﬁeld, then ˜C•(Rn) is exact.

Proof. The ﬁrst part can be proved similar to [8, Theorem 3]. The proof is
by induction on m. If m = −1, then from −1 ≤ (cn(R) − |S| − 3)/2, we
obtain |S| < cn(R). So there is v ∈ Rn in general position with S. Thus
˜ǫ(n(v)) = n. This shows that ˜C0(Rn, S) → ˜C−1(Rn, S) = Z is surjective.
Now let m = 0. Then |S| + 2 < cn(R). Let z ∈ ker(˜ǫ). We may assume that
0}. Since |S′| = |S| + 2 < cn(R), there is
z = (v0) − (v′

0) ∈
˜C1(Rn, S) and ˜∂1(y) = x.

0). Set S′ := S ∪ {v0, v′

Now let the claim is true for all numbers < m. Fix a nonzero vector

v ∈ Rn which is in general position with S.

For z = Pj lj(v0,j, . . . , vm,j) ∈ ˜Cm(Rn, S), let I(z), −1 ≤ I(z) ≤ m,

be the greatest natural number such that for any j, (v0,j, . . . , vI(z),j) is in
general position with Sj := S ∪ {v} ∪ {vI(z)+1,j , . . . , vm,j}.

Now suppose that z ∈ ker( ˜∂m). We want to show that z ∈ im( ˜∂m+1).
First we show that we may assume that I(z) ≥ 0. Let I(z) = −1 and
consider the set Sj := S ∪ {v} ∪ {v0,j, . . . , vm,j}. Since |Sj| = |S| + m + 2 <
cn(R) for any j, there is wj ∈ Rn which is in general position with Sj. Now
if

z1 := z − ˜∂m+1(cid:0)Xj

lj(wj, v0,j, . . . , vm,j)(cid:1),

then ˜∂m(z1) = 0 and I(z1) ≥ 0. Thus we may assume that I(z) ≥ 0.
Moreover, we want to show that we may assume that I(z) = m. So let
−1 < I(z) < m and write z = z′ + z′′, where z′ contains those terms
yj := (v0,j, . . . , vm,j) of z such that I(yj) = I(z) and z′′ contains those terms
yj of z such that I(yj) > I(z). We may write

z =Xk

skxk + z′′

such that sk ∈ ˜CI(z)(Rn) and xk ∈ ˜Cm−I(z)−1(Rn). Note that the terms xk
are disjoint. Thus

˜∂I(z)(sk)xk + (−1)I(z)sk ˜∂m−I(z)−1(xk) + ˜∂m(z′′) = 0.

Xk
k) < I(z) are the terms of Pk

We show that the only terms y′
with I(y′
˜∂m(z′′) and sk ˜∂m−I(z)−1(xk) do not have this property. Now assume that

k in the left hand side of the above formula
˜∂I(z)(sk)xk. Clearly the terms of

y′

k := (v0,k, . . . , cvi,k, . . . , vI(z),k, vI(z)+1,k, . . . , vm,k),

0 ≤ i ≤ I(z), is a term of ˜∂I(z)(sk)xk.
k) = I(z), then the vector
vI(z)+1,k is in general position with S ∪ {v} ∪ {vI(z)+2,k, . . . , vm,k}. But

If I(y′

26

BEHROOZ MIRZAII

(v0,k, . . . , vI(z),k) is in general position with S ∪ {v} ∪ {vI(z)+1,k, . . . , vm,k}.
This implies that (v0,k, . . . , vI(z),k, vI(z)+1,k) should be in general position
with the set S ∪ {v} ∪ {vI(z)+2,k, . . . , vm,k}, which is not possible, because
(v0,k, . . . , vm,k) is a term of z′.

Since xk’s are disjoint, we have ˜∂I(z)(sk) = 0. If xk = (w1,k, . . . , wm−I(z),k),
:=
k ). Moreover, we

then clearly the terms of sk are in general position with the set S′′′
k
S ∪ {v} ∪ {w1,k, . . . , wm−I(z),k}. Thus sk ∈ ˜CI(z)(Rn, S′′′
have

I(z) ≤

.

k ∈ ˜CI(z)+1(Rn, S′′′

k ) such that ˜∂I(z)+1(s′

k) = sk,
kxk), then z1 ∈ ker( ˜∂m) and

˜∂I(z)+1(s′

So by induction, there is s′

for any k. Now if we put z1 := z −Pk
I(z1) = I(cid:16)z′′ + (−1)I(z)+1Xk

s′
k

˜∂m−I(z)−1(xk)(cid:17) > I(z).

˜∂m+1(Z) = z.

By continuing this process we may assume that I(z) = m. This means that
the vector v is in general position with the set S ∪ {v0,k, . . . , vm,k} for all k.

If R = F is a ﬁeld, then the proof of the claim is very easy. Let

Thus if Z := Pk lk(v, v0,k, . . . , vm,k), then Z ∈ ˜Cm+1(Rn, S) and we have
z1 = Pj lj(v0,j, . . . , vm,j) ∈ ˜Cm(F n) and let v be any nonzero vector of
F n. Then Z1 :=Pj lj(v, v0,j , . . . , vm,j) ∈ ˜Cm+1(F n). Now if z1 ∈ ker( ˜∂m),

then ˜∂m+1(Z1) = z1.
Remark 4.5. One can show that in general ˜C•(Rn) is exact for −1 ≤ m ≤
n − 2. But we need the exactness of this complex for m ≤ n − 1 (at least
when n = 3). As we have seen in the above lemma this is easy when R is
a ﬁled. This is probably true for any local ring, but I do not know how to
resolve this problem without considering cn(R). Once this is done, we may
remove the condition about cn+1(R) from the following theorem.

(cid:3)

Theorem 4.6. Let R be a local ring.
|R/mR| = pd.

If R/mR is ﬁnite we assume that

Proof. By Proposition 2.2, Hi(B2) ≃ Hi(T2) for 0 ≤ i ≤ 3. Now con-
sider the natural map H3(GM2(R)) → H3(GL2(R)).
It is clear from the
ﬁltrations of H3(GM2(R)) and H3(GL2(R)) that F0H3(GM2(R)) maps onto
F0H3(GL2(R)). This fact together with Lemmas 5.2 and 5.1 imply that
F2H3(GM2(R)) maps onto F2H3(GL2(R)). Thus

im(H3(GM2(R))) = F2H3(GL2(R)) + imH3(Σ2).

The matrix s =(cid:18)0 1

1 0(cid:19) is conjugate to the matrix(cid:18)1

1

0 −1(cid:19) ∈ B2. Hence

im(H3(Σ2) → H3(GL2(R))) ⊆ im(H3(B2) → H3(GL2(R)))

This completes the proof of the theorem.

(cid:3)

= F0H3(GL2(R) ⊆ F2H3(GL2(R)).

Theorem 5.4. Let |R/mR| 6= 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 16, 32. If R is a domain or an
algebra over a ﬁeld, we only may assume that |R/mR| 6= 2, 3, 4, 8. Then the
kernel of inc∗ : H3(GL2(R)) → H3(GL3(R)) consists of elements of the form

P c(diag(a, 1), diag(1, b), diag(c, c−1)) provided that

P a ⊗ {b, c} + b ⊗ {a, c} = 0 ∈ R× ⊗ K M

In particular, ker(inc∗) ⊆ R× ∪ H2(GL1(R)) ⊆ H3(GL2(R)), where the cup
product is induced by the inclusion inc : R× × GL1(R) → GL2(R). Moreover
ker(inc∗) is a 2-torsion group.

2 (R).

Proof. This can be proved as [11, Theorem 3.1] using Lemma 3.5(ii).

(cid:3)

Let Cl(Rn) be the free abelian groups with a basis consisting of (l + 1)-
tuples (hw0i, . . . , hwli), where every min{l + 1, n} of wi ∈ Rn are basis of
a free direct summand of Rn. Let us deﬁne diﬀerentials ∂l
: Cl(Rn) →
Cl−1(Rn), l ≥ 0, in usual way. So we have the complex of GLn(R)-modules:

C•(Rn) :

· · · → C2(Rn) → C1(Rn) → C0(Rn) → C−1(Rn) = Z → 0.
Lemma 5.5. The complex C•(Rn) is exact for −1 ≤ i ≤ (cn(R) − 3)/2.

Proof. This can be proved as Lemma 4.4.

(cid:3)

In particular, this implies that if |R/mR| > 9, then C•(R3) is exact for

−1 ≤ i ≤ 3 (see Example 4.3). Now as in [17, §3] we can construct a map

ρ : H3(GL3(R)) → p(R)

such that the composition H3(GL2(R)) → H3(GL3(R))
with the map ϕ : H3(GL2(R)) → p(R) constructed in above.

ρ
→ p(R) coincides

Theorem 5.6. Let R be a local ring such that |R/mR| > 9 and |R/mR| 6=
16, 32. If R is a domain or is an algebra over a ﬁeld we may only assume
that |R/mR| > 9. Then we have the exact sequence

H3(GM2(R)) ⊕ H3(T3) → H3(GL3(R))

ρ
→ B(R) → 0.

BEHROOZ MIRZAII

Proof. Let T3 := R×3 = R× × R× × R× embeds diagonally in GL3(R). Then
by Lemma 3.5(ii) it is easy to show that H3(GL3(R)) is generated by the
images of H3(GL2(R)) and R× ∪ R× ∪ R× = im((R×)⊗3 → H3(GL3(R)).
Now one can use Theorem 5.3 to prove the claim as it is done in [17, §3]. (cid:3)

6. A Bloch-wigner exact sequence

Now we are ready to formulate the main theorem of this article.

Theorem 6.1 (Bloch-Wigner exact sequence). Let R be a local ring such
that |R/mR| > 9 and |R/mR| 6= 16, 32. If R is a domain or is an algebra
over a ﬁeld we may only assume that |R/mR| > 9. Then we have the exact
sequence

where TR sits in the short exact sequence

TR → K ind

3

(R) → B(R) → 0,

0 → TorZ

1 (µ(R), µ(R))σ → TR → H1(Σ2, µ2∞(R) ⊗Z µ2∞(R)) → 0.

Moreover, if there is a homomorphism R → F , F a ﬁeld, such that the map
µ(R) → µ(F ) is injective, then we have the exact sequence

0 → TorZ

1 (µ(R), µ(R))∼ → K ind

3

(R) → B(R) → 0,

where the composition

TorZ

1 (µ(R), µ(R)) → TorZ

1 (µ(R), µ(R))∼ → K ind

3

(R)

is induced by the map µ(R) → SL2(R), ξ 7→ diag(ξ, ξ−1).

Proof. This can be done as the proof of [12, Theorem 5.1]

(cid:3)

Note that in the above theorem, TR can be deﬁned as

TR := F2H3(GM2(R))/H3(T2)σ = F2H3(GM2(R))/H3(T2),

and we have the following lemma.

Lemma 6.2. Let R be any commutative ring. Then TR sits in the short
exact sequence
0 → TorZ

1 (µ(R), µ(R))σ → TR → H1(Σ2, µ2∞(R) ⊗ µ2∞(R)) → 0.

Moreover, if we have a homomorphism R → F , F a ﬁeld, such that µ(R) →
µ(F ) is injective, then TR ≃ TorZ

1 (µ(R), µ(R))∼.

Proof. See [12, Section 4, Lemma 4.4, Corollary 4.5].

(cid:3)

Corollary 6.3. Let R be a discrete valuation ring with ﬁeld of fraction K
and residue ﬁeld F = R/mR with more than nine elements. Suppose that
either char(K) = char(F ) or F is ﬁnite. Then the natural map B(R) →
B(K) is an isomorphism.

Proof. By [7, Theorem 2.1] K ind
(K). Thus the claim follows
from the Bloch-Wigner exact sequence for R and K, obtained from Theo-
rem 6.1. Note that here µ(R) = µ(K).

BLOCH-WIGNER THEOREM

31

If F is a ﬁnite ﬁeld such that |F | > 9, then by Theorem 6.1 we have the

Bloch-Wigner exact sequence

0 → TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F ))∼ → K ind

3

(F ) → B(F ) → 0.

But by a direct approach we can prove a better result with easier arguments.

Proposition 6.4. Let F be a ﬁnite ﬁeld with at least four elements.

(i) If F 6= F4, F8, then we have the exact sequence

0 → TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F ))∼ → H3(SL2(F ))F × → B(F ) → 0.

If F = F4 or F8, then we have the exact sequence

0 → TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F )) ⊕ Z/2 → H3(SL2(F ))F × → B(F ) → 0.

(ii) If F 6= F4, F8, then H3(SL2(F ))F × ≃ K ind

then H3(SL2(F ))F × ≃ K ind
exact sequence

(F ) and if F = F4 or F8
(F ) ⊕ Z/2. Moreover, we have the Bloch-Wigner

3

0 → TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F ))∼ → K ind

3

(F ) → B(F ) → 0.

Proof. Since F × is a ﬁnite cyclic group, H2(GL1(F )) = 0. If |F | > 4, we
have H1(SL2(F )) = 0, H2(SL2(F ))F × = 0 (see Example 2.5). Hence by
Lemma 2.6, Hr(F ×, Hs(SL2(F ))) = 0 for all r ≥ 0 and for s = 1, 2.
If
2
F = F4, we have H1(SL2(F )) = 0 and H2(SL2(F )) = Z/2. Since F×
,
the action of F × on Hs(SL2(F )) is trivial. These together with the universal
coeﬃcient theorem imply that Hr(F ×, Hs(SL2(F )) = 0 for any r ≥ 1 and
s = 1, 2. Now by an easy analysis of the corresponding Lyndon-Hochschild-
Serre spectral sequence of the extension

4 = F×
4

1 → SL2(F ) → GL2(F ) → F × → 1,

we obtain the isomorphism

H3(SL2(F ))F × ≃ H3(GL2(F ))/H3(GL1(F )).

(i) First let F 6= F4, F8. From the proof of Theorem 5.3 we see that we

have the exact sequence

F2H3(GM2(F )) → H3(GL2(F )) → B(F ) → 0.

Let M := H3(F ×) ⊕ H3(F ×) ⊆ H3(T2). From the commutative diagram

M

=

−−−−−−→

M

y

y

F2H3(GM2(F )) −→ H3(GL2(F ))→B(F )→ 0,

we obtain the exact sequence TF → H3(SL2(F ))F × → B(F ) → 0. By
Lemma 6.2, TF ≃ TorZ
1 (µ(F ), µ(F ))∼. To ﬁnish the proof of the proposition
we have to prove that the map

TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F ))∼ → H3(SL2(F ))F ×

32

BEHROOZ MIRZAII

is injective. Since

TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F ))∼ → TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F ))∼ = TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F ))

is injective, it is suﬃcient to prove that

TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F ))∼ → H3(SL2(F ))

is injective. Since H3(SL2(F )) ≃ K ind

tion 6.4] it is suﬃcient to prove that

(F ) [10, Corollary 5.4], [9, Proposi-

TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F )) → K ind

3

(F )

is injective. But this has been proved by Suslin [17, Theorem 5.2], thus the
result follows.

Now let F = F4, or F8. Then H3(B2(F )) ≃ H3(T2(F )) ⊕ Z/2 (see Ex-
ample 2.4). Now from the ﬁltration of H3(GL2(F )) induced by the spectral
sequence E1

p,q, we obtain the exact sequences

0 → F2H3(GL2(F )) → H3(GL2(F )) → B(F ) → 0,

H3(B2(F )) → F2H3(GL2(F )) → E2

2,1 → 0,

which imply the exact sequences

0 → F2H3(GL2(F ))/M → H3(SL2(F ))F × → B(F ) → 0,

TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F )) ⊕ Z/2 → F2H3(GL2(F ))/M → E2

2,1 → 0.

By Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2, E′2

2,1 → E2

2,1 is surjective. But

E′2

2,1 ≃ H1(Σ2, µ2∞ (F ) ⊗ µ2∞ (F )) = 0.

Thus we have the exact sequence

TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F )) ⊕ Z/2 → H3(SL2(F ))F × → B(F ) → 0.

Similar to the above, we can show that the natural homomorphism

TorZ

1 (µ(F ), µ(F )) → H3(SL2(F ))F ×

is injective. The map Z/2 → H3(SL2(F8))F8

× is the composition map

Z F×

8 → H3(F8) ≃ H3(N (F8)) → H3(SL2(F8))F×

8

Z/2 ≃V3

and the map Z/2 → H3(SL2(F4))F4

× is the composition map

Z/2 ≃ (F×

4 ⊗ F×

4 )−σ ≃ H3(F4)F×

4

≃ H3(N (F4)) → H3(SL2(F4))F×

4

which both maps are injective by Example 2.7. This completes the proof of
(i).

(ii) Let F 6= F4, F8. Then by Theorem 5.4, the kernel of the map
inc∗ : H3(GL2(F )) → H3(GL3(F )) consists of elements of the form x =

P c(diag(a, 1), diag(1, b), diag(c, c−1)) provided that
P a ⊗ {b, c} + b ⊗ {a, c} = 0 ∈ F × ⊗ K M

Since x ∈ im(H2(F ×) ⊗ F × → H3(GL2(F ))) and H2(F ×) = 0, the kernel of
inc∗ is trivial. On the other hand from the exact sequence of Lemma 3.5(ii),

2 (F ).

BLOCH-WIGNER THEOREM

one sees easily that inc∗ is surjective. These together with the homology
stability of Proposition 4.7, proves that

H3(GL2(F ))

≃
−→ H3(GL3(F ))

≃
−→ H3(GL4(F ))

≃
−→ · · · .

Finally, we have

H3(SL2(F ))F × ≃ H3(GL2(F ))/H3(GL1(F ))
≃ H3(GL(F ))/H3(GL1(F ))
≃ H3(SL(F ))
≃ K3(F )
= K ind

(F ).

Now let F = F4, or F = F8. Since F × = F ×2, we have H3(SL2(F ))F × =
H3(SL2(F )). But by a direct calculation one can show that H3(SL2(F4)) ≃
Z/30 and H3(SL2(F8)) ≃ Z/126. Moreover, by Quillen’s calculation of
(Fq) = K3(Fq) ≃ Z/(q2 − 1).
the K-groups of ﬁnite ﬁelds, we have K ind
Thus K ind
(F8) ≃ Z/63. Therefore H3(SL2(F ))F × ≃
K ind
(Fq) ⊕ Z/2. (See Example 6.6 below for another proof of this part.)
Finally, the Bloch-Wigner exact sequence follows from (i).
(cid:3)

(F4) ≃ Z/15 and K ind

Corollary 6.5. The Bloch group of a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq with at least four ele-
ments is

B(Fq) ≃(Z/(q + 1)

Z/( q+1
2 )

if q is even
if q is odd.

Proof. This follows from the Bloch-Wigner exact sequence for ﬁnite ﬁelds
proved in the previous proposition and the fact that

TorZ

1 (µ(Fq), µ(Fq)) ≃ Fq

× ≃ Z/(q − 1).

Note that K ind
TorZ
TorZ

1 (µ(Fq), µ(Fq))∼ = TorZ
1 (µ(Fq), µ(Fq))∼ ≃ Z/2(q − 1).

(Fq) = K3(Fq) ≃ Z/(q2 − 1). Moreover, if q is even then
1 (µ(Fq), µ(Fq)) ≃ Z/(q − 1) and if q is odd then
(cid:3)

Example 6.6. Let F be any ﬁnite ﬁeld. We already have proved that

H3(SL2(F ))F × ≃ H3(GL2(F ))/H3(GL1(F )),

(see the proof of Proposition 6.4). In fact we proved this for |F | ≥ 4. But
the same isomorphism can be proved easily for |F | = 2, 3.

If char(F ) = p > 0, then by Example 2.7, we have

(H3(SL2(F ))F ×)(p) ≃(Z/p if |F | = 2, 3, 4, 8

otherwise.

0

This implies that

H3(SL2(F ))F × ≃(H3(SL2(F ), Z[1/p])F × ⊕ Z/p if |F | = 2, 3, 4, 8

H3(SL2(F ), Z[1/p])F ×

otherwise.

But Hutchinson has proved that for any ﬁnite ﬁeld F , the action of F × on
H3(SL2(F ), Z[1/p]) is trivial and H3(SL2(F ), Z[1/p]) ≃ K ind
(F ) [6, Lemma
3.8, Corollary 3.9]. These imply that

H3(SL2(F ))F × ≃(K ind
