We analyze the energy spectra of single b-jets and B-hadrons resulting from the production and
decay of top quarks within the SM at the LHC at the NLO QCD. For both hadrons and jets, we
calculate the correlation of the peak of the spectrum with the top quark mass, considering the
“energy-peak” as an observable to determine the top quark mass. Such a method is motivated
by our previous work where we argued that this approach can have reduced sensitivity to the
details of the production mechanism of the top quark, whether it is higher-order QCD eﬀects or
new physics contributions. As part of the NLO improvement over the original proposal, we assess
the residual sensitivity of the extracted top quark mass to perturbative eﬀects both in top quark
production and decay. For a 1% jet energy scale uncertainty (and assuming negligible statistical
error), the top quark mass can then be extracted using the energy-peak of b-jets with an error
±(1.2(exp) + 0.6(th)) GeV. We note that recently the CMS collaboration reported a top quark
mass measurement based on the original proposal (with b-jets) so that our result contributes to a
precise evaluation of the associated theory uncertainty. In view of the dominant jet energy scale
uncertainty in the measurement using b-jets, we also investigate the extraction of the top quark
mass from the energy-peak of the corresponding B-hadrons which, in principle, can be measured
without this uncertainty. The calculation of the B-hadron energy spectrum is carried out using
fragmentation functions at NLO. The dependence on the fragmentation scale turns out to be the
largest theoretical uncertainty in this extraction of top quark mass. Future improvement of the
treatment of bottom quark hadronization can reduce this uncertainty, rendering methods based on
the B-hadron energy-peak competitive for the top quark mass measurement.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The top quark is a most peculiar particle of the Stan-
dard Model (SM), as it experiences both the strongest
forces of the SM, i.e. the strong interaction with gluons
and the Yukawa interaction with the Higgs boson, the
latter also making it heaviest particle of the SM. These
features make the top-Higgs sector a cornerstone of the
construction of the SM and of most models of physics be-
yond the SM, especially those motivated by addressing
the Planck-weak scale hierarchy problem.

A complete knowledge of the top-Higgs sector is there-
fore a key step for a full exploration of SM physics and
for testing models of new physics. In fact, the possibility
that the SM holds at least as a consistent theory up to
the scale of quantum gravity (or Planck scale) requires
the Higgs potential to not develop instabilities below this
scale, which can be triggered by too strong a top Yukawa
interaction, that is too heavy a top quark [1]. For such
vacuum stability to hold, the measurements of the Higgs
mass require the top quark to be lighter than a value
that is within a few GeV from the current top quark
mass world combination [2][3–5]. Therefore, a precise
measurement of the mass of the top quark is mandatory
to discuss the validity of the SM up to the highest ener-
gies. Furthermore, the top quark mass is a key parameter
for testing the consistency of the SM through precision
measurements of the electroweak sector [6]. Additional
motivation to measure the top quark mass with high ac-

curacy arises in the context of models of new physics.
For instance, the prediction of the Higgs boson mass in
supersymmetric models has a strong fourth power depen-
dence on the top quark mass and the uncertainty on this
mass ends up being a dominant one [7–11]. Finally, new
types of searches for beyond SM physics in top-like ﬁnal
state can be performed exploiting the precision knowl-
edge of the top quark mass and of its production and
decay mechanisms in QCD [12, 13][14, 15][16–20].

All the above considerations give tremendous motiva-
tion to measure the top quark mass accurately, which
is therefore a subject of intense activity at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) (and was at the TeVatron). The
present measurements [21, 22] reach experimental pre-
cision at or below 1 GeV. In order to support this
achieved precision, it is clear that the theory descrip-
tion for hadronic scatterings needs to be accurate. The
point is that at this level of precision a variety of subtle
theoretical eﬀects become relevant, e.g. the eﬀects of ex-
tra radiation, eﬀects from formation of hadrons, oﬀ-shell
eﬀects, and more. Some of these eﬀects cannot be com-
puted from ﬁrst principles, hence require some modelling.
Therefore, it is important to come up with stress-tests for
the results of the top quark mass measurement.

Fortunately, there is a way out as follows. The large
top quark sample collected at Run I, and even more the
anticipated data set for Run II, allow us to employ a
variety of methods to extract the top quark mass from
the LHC [23–34], including methods that require rare ﬁ-

nal states (e.g. [27]). Each mass determination will (in
general) have diﬀerent sensitivity to the several theoret-
ical issues that aﬀect top quark physics (in addition to
varying experimental systematics). Thus these methods
are all complementary, allowing us to study in depth the
uncertainties of each method.

A brief survey of the methods currently available fol-
lows. Methods used especially at the TeVatron, e.g. the
matrix element method of [35], try to exploit the corre-
lation of the top quark mass with each single component
of the four-momenta of all particles in the top quark ﬁ-
nal state. By doing so, these methods can yield very
precise measurements even in presence of a limited data
sample. The ﬂip side of this approach is that they rely
crucially on the theoretical description of the top quark
production and decay, thus being sensitive to a number of
possible inaccuracies therein (both the perturbative and
the non-perturbative aspects of them).

In order to minimize this sensitivity, several proposals
have been made to measure the top quark mass from a
well-deﬁned kinematical observable [36]. Of course, even
in this approach, in order to extract a measured value of
the mass, we need to compute from theory the correla-
tion between the top quark mass and each of the proposed
observables. Such a procedure inevitably ties the mea-
surement to our theory description and still exposes it to
possible mis-modelling of hadronic collisions at the LHC.
However, the crucial diﬀerence is that in relating the top
quark mass to a single kinematical observable, one tends
to be less susceptible in this regard (as follows). First,
intrinsically the used observable is clearly more inclusive
(with respect to other properties of the events) than the
use of the full matrix element as done in the methods
mentioned above (i.e. similar to Ref. [35]). Furthermore,
this property implies that for some observables there is
evidently protection from inaccuracies in describing cer-
tain eﬀects. For instance, when using purely leptonic
observables one can argue that possible uncertainties in
the theory description of the formation of hadrons are
largely irrelevant. Finally, in the computation of the cor-
relation between a single kinematic observable and the
top quark mass, it is possible to estimate the theory un-
certainties rather straightforwardly, e.g. from scale vari-
ations in a perturbative computation. Such an error esti-
mation procedure, while still not being perfect, is under
better control (and scrutiny) than the one that can be
performed on methods similar to Ref. [35].

Of course, there is the possibility of new physics con-
tribution in top quark production which is not taken into
account by both the above classes of methods, since it is
assumed therein that the top quarks are produced only
by SM interactions. On the other hand, one can use
methods based on Lorentz-invariant observables such as
the distribution of invariant mass of decay products or
endpoints of transverse mass, which would not be sensi-
tive to new physics, at least for new physics contributing
to the top quark sample via the production of on-shell
top quarks. Thus far, only the CMS collaboration had

2

performed such an experimental analysis [23].

In summary then, for all the above-mentioned reasons,
it is prospected that at the end of the LHC program,
the implementation of several of those methods (and any
future ones) for the top quark mass measurement will
provide a powerful consistency check and thus enable a
global determination of the top quark mass at the LHC
with an uncertainty evaluated with much higher conﬁ-
dence than that in any single method.

In light of the above discussion, in this paper we sys-
tematically develop a new method for the precision deter-
mination of the top quark mass with higher order correc-
tions taken into account, based on the energy distribution
of b-jets and B-hadrons resulting from its decay, which
promises to add signiﬁcant information to the combina-
tion of methods presently available. In particular, we will
show in detail that the present method has reduced sen-
sitivity to mis-modelling of the production mechanism of
the top quark at the LHC, including possible production
of top quarks from new physics.

Our method reﬁnes and extends the original proposal
in Ref. [28]: we contextualize our contribution by ﬁrst
recapitulating this earlier work.
It is very well-known
that, in the rest-frame of the top quark undergoing a
(strictly) two-body decay into a bottom quark and W
boson, the energy of the bottom quark is single-valued:

(LO)
ˆE

t − m2

W

,

(1)

which is nothing but a simple function of the masses in-
volved.1 However, in the laboratory frame at a hadron
collider, the top quark is produced with a non-zero boost,
that too in general diﬀerent in one event and the next.
Thus, the above δ-function of the bottom quark energy
in the rest-frame gets smeared into a non-trivial observed
energy spectrum, which varies with the boost distribu-
tion of the top quark (as expected due to energy being
a Lorentz-variant quantity). In turn, the boost distribu-
tion of the top quark depends on details of its production,
including the matrix element involved and external pa-
rameters such as the collider energy and relevant parton
distributions.

Remarkably, it was shown in Ref. [28] that, assuming
the top quark is produced unpolarized, the location of the
maximum of the inclusive bottom quark energy distribu-
tion (dubbed the “energy-peak”) remains the same as the
(single) value in the rest-frame. To stress the signiﬁcance
of such a result, we underline that the statement is valid
irrespective of the boost distribution of the top quark,
that is to say the energy-peak is “invariant” in this sense.
The upshot of the above argument is that measuring
this energy-peak can (in principle) aﬀord us the oppor-
tunity for a determination of the top quark mass which
can be rather insensitive to uncertainties in top quark

1 Here, the bottom quark mass is neglected for simplicity.

production, whether arising from higher order (as yet
uncalculated) QCD eﬀects within the SM or any possi-
ble new physics contribution beyond it. In other words,
energy-peak methods, being based on an invariance of the
decay, have the potential to enjoy several of the beneﬁts
of mass measurement which are traditionally reserved for
manifestly Lorentz invariant quantities mentioned ear-
lier, even though naively this looks implausible, given
that energy by itself is not invariant. Moreover, energy-
peak methods, being based on single-particle measure-
ments, might not share some of the drawbacks of those
other methods, for example, combinatorial ambiguities
(for both invariant and transverse mass) or reliance on
the use of the missing transverse momentum (for the lat-
ter). Because of these possible advantages oﬀered by
energy-peak methods, we expect that a top quark mass
determination following them will be complementary to
existing ones.

Of course, as with other methods, one has to con-
sider robustness of the energy-peak to going beyond the
above framework. First of all, the bottom quark from
the top quark decay manifests in the detector as a b-jet
containing a B-hadron. Therefore, one has to correlate
the above-discussed energy-peak of the bottom quark to
that of what is actually observed. For example, we ex-
pect that hard radiation in the decay of the top quark,
i.e. t → bW g, when not reclustered in the b-jets that we
analyze will lead to deviations of the b-jet energy-peak
from Eq. (1), hence the superscript “LO” there. This
eﬀect is analogous to the softening of the di-lepton in-
variant mass spectrum from decays of the Z boson due
to the escaped hard radiation, i.e. Z → l+l−γ, and was
already mentioned in our work Ref. [28]. In addition, as
discussed already in Ref. [28], in a realistic situation we
cannot deal with a fully inclusive spectrum, due to cuts
needed to remove backgrounds, leading to loss of a strict
invariance.

With these considerations, the goal of the present pa-
per is to study in detail the above higher-order eﬀects on
the energy-peak methods for measuring the top quark
mass. As we will see quantitatively, this improvement
on the earlier result of Ref. [28] is necessary in order to
employ this method for a precision top quark mass mea-
surement at the LHC. In particular, assuming pure QCD
production, we ﬁrst present a calculation at the next-to-
leading order (NLO) in αs of the energy distribution of
the single b-jets from the top quark production and decay
at the LHC 2, thus computing the shift in the energy-peak
from Eq. (1) at this order (originating primarily from the
above-mentioned radiation in the decay). Note that the
size of this shift is estimated to be of order αs/π, that
is few percent (i.e.
several GeV) level, relative to the
LO prediction. This eﬀect constitutes the main source of

2 A related computation already appears in [37], where the distri-
bution the of sum of the two b-jet energies at NLO was shown.

theory error in our earlier work Ref. [28]: it is then crit-
ical to calculate this NLO eﬀect, as we do in this work,
to reach the ∼ 1 GeV uncertainty of current methods
used to measure the top quark mass. With the NLO re-
sult at hand, we assess the size of the residual sensitivity
to QCD corrections in production and decay of the top
quark. Our study indicates that a perturbative theory
uncertainty of about 1 GeV can be achieved, establish-
ing a precision attainable with the energy-peak methods
which is comparable to that of other existing methods.

We reiterate here that, thanks to the above-mentioned
peak invariance, the sensitivity of the measured top
quark mass to any uncertainties in the understanding of
the production of top quarks, including that from higher-
order QCD corrections, is reduced for this method (as
compared to other methods). This “screening” happens
because the actual measurement carried out at the ex-
periments is not far from the ideal case for which the
invariance result strictly applies. In other words, the ex-
perimental conditions allow us to go quite close to the
measurement of the inclusive energy spectrum of a bot-
tom quark, that is a jet which contains all the radiation
of the parent quark and no pollution from other radi-
ation, without requiring too hard cuts to remove back-
grounds. This implies that the eﬀects from mis-modelling
the relevant production are felt only through small per-
turbations on the original invariance, that are weighted
by a factor of order αs/π for eﬀects from hard radiation
from the bottom quark or a similarly small factor for the
non-inclusiveness of the spectrum due to selection cuts.
Extending the above discussion to possible new physics
contribution to production of top quark, we see that the
sensitivity of the energy-peak to such eﬀects is similarly
suppressed, because also in this case it is weighted by the
above small factors (or by the polarization fraction and
velocity of the top quarks, in case they have a preferred
polarization state). This should be contrasted with the
methods that assume the SM matrix element from the
very beginning, which might (in principle) face the full
impact of this uncertainty. All in all, the above discussion
shows that our work is bringing important new elements
for the current precision measurement of the top quark
mass from the LHC [30, 38] and similarly for the future
runs.

As a matter of fact, following our earlier proposal in
Ref. [28], the CMS collaboration in Ref. [25] has already
measured the top quark mass from the location of the
peak in the b-jet energy spectrum at Run I, although
without the full NLO corrections in the theory used to
interpret the measurement. The results of the present
work will thus be crucial for a precise evaluation of the
theory uncertainty on this determination of the top quark
mass during the next iteration of such measurement.

As is true for many of the methods presently formu-
lated, the measurement of the top quark mass from the
b-jet energy spectrum will suﬀer from the experimental
jet energy scale uncertainty. Attempting to surpass this
obstacle for future high-precision measurements, we ex-

plore the possibility to extract the top quark mass using
the energy spectrum of the B-hadrons contained in a b-
jet. This spectrum in principle can be be measured using
only the tracker sub-detector, hence liberating the mea-
surement from the jet energy scale uncertainty, for in-
stance, exploiting the decays of B-hadrons into charged
hadrons, such as B+ → K +π+π− or any of the J/ψ
modes used in Ref. [27]. Anticipating the exploitation
of this exciting possibility at the time when the LHC
data set will be large enough to study these rare decays,
we perform the calculation of the energy-peak of the B-
hadrons using fragmentation functions accurate at NLO
in QCD. We study the correlation of this observable with
the top quark mass and the theory error on a possible
measurement of the top quark mass using it. We ﬁnd
that the present theoretical description of the formation
of B-hadrons gives errors slightly larger than those of the
existing methods for top quark mass measurement, but
the theory improvements that might be available by the
time the LHC will be ready to study these rare decays
might lead to a competitive measurement.

This paper is organized as follows:

in Section II we
recall relevant aspects of the physics of energy distribu-
tions (in particular, their peaks) from two-body decays
presented in Ref. [28] and we describe the challenges and
expected results of the extension to NLO of previous LO
results.
In Section III we present our results for the
14 TeV LHC for the measurement of the top quark mass
from the analysis of energy-peaks of (single) b-tagged jets
from top quark pair production in the eµ ﬁnal state for
the two W bosons. In Section IV we present analogous re-
sults based on calculations of the single B-hadron energy
spectrum obtained from the pp → b¯b(cid:96)¯(cid:96)ν ¯ν process supple-
mented with fragmentation function at NLO QCD [37].
We present our conclusions and outlook in Section V.

II. ENERGY SPECTRA AND THE TOP

QUARK MASS

We begin with a brief review of the energy spectra
of massless two-body decay products, assuming that a
sample of decaying particles has no preferred polariza-
tion state: it turns out that these spectra enjoy special
properties within relativistic kinematics. A good exam-
ple to accommodate this situation is the top quark (pro-
duced at the LHC) decaying into a bottom quark, which
is approximately massless compared to its typical energy
scale, and an (on-shell) W gauge boson. Furthermore,
if pair-produced, the top quark is unpolarized since it is
produced predominantly via QCD. For such a top quark
decay, we then obtain a b quark energy distribution peak-
ing at the value of Eq. (1) [28].3 The superscript “LO”
in Eq. (1) stresses that this relation holds for a strictly

4

two-body decay of the top quark. Eq. (1) implies that a
measurement of the energy peak together with the known
value of the W boson mass enables us to determine the
mass of the top quark.

Strictly speaking, this result is valid for a fully inclusive
sample of b quarks from the top quark decay. Therefore,
the peak position predicted in Eq. (1) will shift if one re-
stricts the analysis only to a subset of the b quarks (e.g.
the ones detected in the most sensitive region of the ex-
periment). Furthermore, it is inevitable that a fraction of
top quark decays contain extra hard emissions, in partic-
ular, ﬁnal state radiation resulting in three-body decays
of the top quark which would lead to a violation of the
relation in (1) [40]. On top of these issues, the actual
observable is not an isolated b quark but a b-tagged jet
reconstructed from detected hadrons, causing additional
subtleties. Indeed, Ref. [28] performed an analysis to in-
vestigate the potential eﬀects from the above-mentioned
issues and found that they are not a major hurdle in de-
termining the top quark mass at leading order accuracy
with the b-jet energy-peak technique.
In this work we
shall re-examine the eﬀect of taking a non-inclusive sam-
ple of b-jets (as unavoidable for experimental reasons)
and that of extra radiation, with the goal of i) making a
statement on those eﬀects by treating the ﬁrst emission
in QCD (correcting both production and decay) with-
out any approximations and ii) estimating the potential
impact of multiple emissions in the parton shower ap-
proximation.

In next two sections, we study the prediction of per-
turbative QCD and its theory uncertainty upon the re-
lation between the top quark mass and a physical observ-
able. For this purpose, we consider the maximum in the
energy spectrum of b-jets (Section III) and B-hadrons
(Section IV) subject to typical selection cuts. We begin
with the perturbative QCD prediction for the diﬀerential
energy distribution

dσ

dEb−tag

for the process pp → t¯t → b¯be−µ+ + ν ¯ν ,(2)

where Eb−tag denotes the energy of any b-tagged jets
(tagged hadrons) in the given event. From the shape of
this distribution we determine its maximum point, which
we henceforth denote by ˆEb−tag. Since typical energy
spectra are broadly distributed, in practice, we obtain
the maximum point by ﬁtting
to a function. The
detailed ﬁtting procedure will be given when each of the
speciﬁc applications are discussed later.

dEb−tag

dσ

As obvious from Eq. (1), the LO perturbative QCD
prediction for ˆEb−tag has a simple dependence on the
top quark mass. In general, in the vicinity of any ﬁxed
top quark mass value ¯mt, the functional dependence of
ˆEb−tag over mt can be linearized:

ˆEb−tag = ρb(mt − ¯mt) + const + O(cid:0)(mt − ¯mt)2(cid:1) , (3)

3 See also [39] for analogous arguments valid for π0 → γγ decay.

where the coeﬃcient ρb encodes the correlation between
the physical observable to be measured in experiments

(the peak of the energy distribution) and the SM param-
eter we intend to measure (the top quark mass). At the
lowest order in perturbation theory and for fully inclu-
sive spectra, the prediction in Eq. (1) gives ρb (cid:39) 0.6 and
const (cid:39) 68 GeV for ¯mt = 173 GeV. Beyond the lowest
order in perturbation theory, the prediction for the right
hand side of Eq. (3) depends on details of the calculation
such as the order in perturbation theory and the choices
for the renormalization and factorization scales. The dif-
ference between the predictions by equivalent theory cal-
culations (e.g. varying scale choices or other unphysical
parameters) can provide a measure of the theory uncer-
tainty for the relevant prediction. To assess this uncer-
tainty we perform several variations in our calculations
determining the prediction in Eq. (3). We give full detail
our assessment scheme for each of the mass measurement
applications later. Finally, in order to use the relation in
Eq. (3) beyond the lowest order in perturbation theory,
we need to specify what is the mt in its right hand side.
In what follows, we shall take the ﬁxed order calcula-
tion in the pole mass scheme, and therefore, unless noted
otherwise, mt throughout this work is the top quark pole
mass.

Before describing the actual calculations and their re-
sults, it is worth discussing the new eﬀects that arise once
we go beyond the leading order in perturbation theory.
Compared to the lowest order description, the addition
of extra radiation to the production and decay of the top
quark induces several modiﬁcations in the energy dis-
tribution of the decay products of the top quark decay,
some of which also aﬀect our observable ˆEb−tag. As we
present our calculations with the production and decay of
top quarks factorized, we can discuss separately the po-
tential eﬀects in the production and decay of top quarks.
Suppose that the LO process is represented by

pp → t¯t ⊗ t → bW ,

(4)

where we symbolize the factorization of the top quark
decay by ⊗ and leave implicitly the charge conjugate de-
cay of ¯t for notational simplicity. NLO corrections to
the production mechanism modify the above-given LO
expression into

pp → t¯t + 0 or 1 jets ⊗ t → bW .

(5)

The extra radiation accompanying the production of the
t¯t pair does not aﬀect the decay of the top quarks per se.
It merely changes the boost of the t¯t system, hence the
boost from the rest frame of each top quark to the labora-
tory frame. Therefore, one can expect that the existence
of extra radiation in production will aﬀect the overall
shape of dσ/dEb−tag. However, due to the fact that the
energy-peak is insensitive to the details of the boost dis-
tribution of the decaying particle, any extra radiation
at the production level does not alter the LO relation
between our observables and the top quark mass. This
implies that, very strikingly, Eq. (1) is still valid for in-
clusive bottom quark energy spectra computed with NLO

lection criteria in Eq. (8) with production of the t¯t at LO

of the two spectra and highlights the tendency of the NLO
production correction to harden the spectrum as expected
from extra radiation aﬀecting the b-jet energy through clus-
tering.

corrections to the production mechanism and LO descrip-
tions of the decay. We point out that this production-
level radiation can still make an eﬀect on our observable
in the reconstructed b-jet energy spectra, because the jet
clustering can cluster in the b-jet radiation that was not
originated by the b quark. Clearly, this eﬀect becomes
increasingly signiﬁcant as the size of the jets grows. We
have checked explicitly that it grows proportionally to
the jet area, that is to say ˆEb−tag = const + coeﬀ · R2.
Furthermore, we also found that for inclusive b-jet spec-
tra const = ˆELO
of Eq. (1), hence the eﬀect disappears
for inﬁnitesimally small jets, as implied by the insensi-
tivity of the energy peak to the boost distribution of the
top discussed in Ref. [28]. The eﬀect for the realistic jet
size R = 0.5, which is employed throughout our anal-
ysis, is fully taken into account in our top quark mass
determination. An example of the hardening of the spec-
trum caused by clustering eﬀects is shown in Figure 1 for
µF = µR = mt = 171 GeV and selection cuts given in
Eq. (8). The bottom panel of the ﬁgure demonstrates the
ratio of the diﬀerential energy spectrum from the process
Eq.(4) to that from the process Eq. (5), from which we
clearly see a (slight) hardening eﬀect in the low energy
regime.

When it comes to the decay NLO, the relevant correc-

tions modify the LO process into

pp → t¯t ⊗ t → bW + 0 or 1 jets.

In this case the b-tagged object is systematically softer

extra resolved parton that emerges as a separate jet from
the top quark decay. Under this circumstance, both the
overall shape and the peak in dσ/dEb−tag are diﬀerent
compared to the leading order case. In fact, the decay
with an extra jet is a three-body decay for which, as
established in great detail in Refs. [40, 41], the expected
maximum point is lower than that in the LO case, i.e.
ˆEb−tag < ˆE(LO)
. This inequality is the only genuine NLO
correction that we expect for this kind of extraction of the
top quark mass. This remark is very important because
it allows us to estimate the higher order corrections of
the peak position such that

where d is a coeﬃcient encapsulating the dependence on
several parameters (e.g. jet deﬁnition, top quark mass,
scales used in the calculation) but is not expected to
be subject to any accidental enhancement, for example,
from large logarithms or large increases of initial state
luminosity, as it can happen in calculating corrections to
production. An example of eﬀect of adding radiation in
decay is displayed in Figure 2, for µF = µR = mt =
171 GeV and selection cuts given in Eq. (8). In particu-
lar, the bottom panel shows the ratio of the diﬀerential
energy spectrum from the process (2) at production and
decay NLO to that from the process (5), which manifests
well the softening of the spectrum due to NLO correc-
tions to the decay of the top quark.

The case with the B-hadron can be understood in an
analogous manner to the previous case, given that it
emerges from the b quark as the result of t → W b →
W B + X. Here the “X” system surrounding the B-
hadron (i.e. the rest of the b-jet) draws a certain frac-
tion of energy of the parent bottom quark. This picture
resembles a three-body decay of the top quark, i.e. sim-
ilarly to t → bW + g discussed earlier, so that another
inequality ˆEB < ˆE(LO)
is anticipated for the B-hadron
case (cf. Eq. (7)). In this case, the discrepancy between
the B-hadron energy-peak and the LO result in (1) is
governed by the physics of hadronization. Note that
the strong coupling constant relevant to hadronization
is larger than that relevant to extra emission and the
associated ﬁnal state that we investigate is more exclu-
sive than the b-jet ﬁnal state. We therefore expect that
the corresponding eﬀect in this case will be larger, and
possibly converging less fast than that in the b-jet case.

b-JET RESULTS

We now present the detailed calculations of the energy-
peak method for top quark mass measurement using
b-jets. We compute energy spectra of b-tagged jets
using mcfm 6.8 [42] cross-checked by the code from
Ref. [37, 43] including real and virtual corrections to the

process in Eq. (2). The calculation is carried out using
the mstw08nlo PDFs set [44] at the center of mass en-
ergy
s = 14 TeV. We treat the top quark in the narrow-
width approximation and include NLO spin correlations.
We then set the renormalization scale µR and the factor-
ization scale µF to be equal for our baseline calculation,
and vary them within the range of [0.5mt, 2mt] to obtain
a measure of the theory uncertainty in the calculation.
Jets are constructed from the ﬁnal state partons using
the anti-kT algorithm [45] with size parameter R being
0.5. An event is kept to ﬁll the dσ/dEb−tag distribution if
it contains exactly two leptons and satisﬁes the following
set of cuts:
pT,(cid:96) > 20 GeV, |η(cid:96)| < 2.5, pT,j > 30 GeV, |ηj| < 2.5 .
(8)
Any jet containing at least one b quark as a jet con-
stituent is identiﬁed as a b-jet. We require exactly such
two b-tagged jets, so that from each event we get two
contributions to ﬁll into the b-jet energy distribution.

For each choice of scales µF and µR the relevant calcu-
lation yields an energy spectrum dσ/dEb−tag from which
we ﬁnd the maximum point by ﬁtting it to a ﬁtting func-
tion and ﬁnding the best ﬁt. The ﬁt is performed as a
least-χ2 ﬁt, and our model function f (Eb−tag) has the

a measure of the width of the spectrum parametrized by
w, and their statistical errors obtained from χ2 varia-
tions.

The prediction for ˆEb−tag as a function of the top quark
pole mass is exhibited in Figure 3 by the gray band. The
solid line represents the prediction for the central scale
choice, i.e. µF = µR = mt, and our result for the interval
shown in the ﬁgure is

ˆEb−tag = 0.55 · mt − 25 GeV ,

(10)

with RMS deviation δrms = 0.18 GeV. The thickness of
the band expresses the theory uncertainty which reﬂects
the diﬀerence around the peak region between the pre-
dicted energy spectra for diﬀerent choices of µR and µF .
An example of such spectra for diﬀerent choices of the
scales is given in Figure 4. To better display the size of
the scale sensitivity, in the bottom panel we provide the
ratio of the diﬀerential energy spectrum from the pro-
cess Eq. (2) at full NLO with µF = µR = mt/2 to that
with µF = µR = 2mt. Picking an inﬁnitely well mea-
sured value of ˆEb−tag results in a theory uncertainty on
mt well below ±1 GeV. Assuming an experimental error
of ∼ 1% on the measured energy peak in the jet energy
distribution, which is close to what was found in Ref. [25],
and following Ref. [32] for the deﬁnition of the errors, we
ﬁnd that the uncertainty on the top quark mass δmt is

δmt = ±(1.2(exp) + 0.6(th)) GeV .

(11)

This shows that our analysis of the energy spectrum
around the peak region can determine a top quark mass
with O(1 GeV) error, which is one of the main results
of our work and demonstrates the utility of the energy
spectrum analysis for precision mass measurements.

To test the robustness of our prediction several vari-
ations of the calculations have been executed. Our ﬁrst

test is to set the central values of µR and µF at HT /2.
Here HT is deﬁned as the scalar sum of transverse mo-
menta of visible particles, and therefore, by construction
the scale values dynamically change event-by-event, as
opposed to the constant mt for the baseline scale choice.
The result for µR = µF = HT /2 is reported by the
dashed line in Figure 3, which is well within the band
determined from scale variation, hence corroborating the
solidity of our estimate of theory uncertainty. Variations
of the clustering algorithm have been performed as well
and we found that using the kT algorithm [46] gives in-
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the predictions. We also exam-
ine several potential sources of the theory uncertainty in
the top quark mass determination such as diﬀerent def-
initions of selection cuts, diﬀerent ﬁtting ranges for the
peak extraction, and diﬀerent choices of the jet size pa-
rameter R. All these studies strengthen the conclusion
that our estimate of the theory uncertainty is sound.

In reality, the transition from partons to the hadrons
measured in the experiments involves more complicated
dynamics than what is described by perturbative NLO
corrections. A couple of solutions are possible to im-
prove this situation and make closer contact with exper-
imentally measurable quantities. We can make use of
a calculation matching NLO matrix elements and par-
ton showers such as that of Ref. [47], or describe di-
rectly the formation of hadrons, for example, in the frag-
mentation function formalism [48]. In the next section,
we will pursue the latter approach in detail, while we
leave for the future a full study of the prediction of a
matched calculation. Nevertheless, here we wish to es-
timate the theory uncertainties carried by the parton
shower. To this end we present results obtained from

centrating on assessing the variability of the results ob-
tained upon changes in parameters of the parton shower.
We compute the spectrum dσ/dEb−tag according to
the same deﬁnition described earlier, preparing LO
parton-level events for the process in Eq. (2) with
MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [49] and subsequently feed-
ing them to Pythia 8.210 for parton showering [50].
We remark that the latter Monte Carlo package has
been tuned to data to give a better description on heavy
quark fragmentation [51] and has been investigated, by
the ATLAS collaboration, for the sensitivity to its par-
ton shower parameters in the context of t¯t production
at the LHC [52]. Moreover, the description of extra ra-
diation in the process Eq. (2) has been studied in de-
tail in Pythia8 [53]. All these considerations suggest
that Pythia 8 should provide a solid framework to study
showering eﬀects on our observables.

We have studied the sensitivity of dσ/dEb−tag and
of ˆEb−tag to changes of the strong coupling constant
used in the time-like and space-like shower in Pythia
8.210, which probes the sensitivity of our observable to
the overall amount of radiation added to the LO pro-
cess, as well as the sensitivity to changes of the sev-
eral cut-oﬀ scales and damping scheme of the space-like
shower (Pythia parameters SpaceShower:pTdampMatch,
SpaceShower:pTmaxMatch, and SpaceShower:pTmin),
which probes the sensitivity of our observable to the kine-
matics of the shower. We remark that we have retained
the defaults matching scheme of the time-like shower be-
cause for resonances decay, such as the top quark de-
cay under consideration, Pythia8 performs a matching
[53, 54] between a matrix element description of top de-
cay with extra jets and parton shower that is expected to
be comparable in accuracy to a matched NLO calculation
such as that of powheg [47]. Therefore, the study of the
sensitivity to the value of αs in the time-like shower is
expected to give a fair estimate of the showering uncer-
tainty for the description of radiation in the decay.

The sensitivity to changes of parameters are quantiﬁed
through the following log-derivatives with respect to the
parameters listed above

∆X ≡ X

ˆEb−tag

∂ ˆEb−tag

∂X

.

(12)

It turns out that the largest one is the sensitivity to αs in
the time-like shower, which is ∆αs (cid:39) −0.05. Given the
importance of the description of radiation in the decay,
this result is completely expected, and the sign is fully
understood from the discussion around Eq. (7). More
quantitatively, this result implies that the extracted top
quark mass is shifted by more than 1 GeV if a varia-
tion greater than 12% in αs is considered. Compared to
standard procedure for the variation of αs in tuning of
parton showers [51] and considering the possibility to fur-
ther improve these tunings in future updates of Ref. [52],
the uncertainties that arise from the physics of parton
shower appear subdominant to those considered above

from scale sensitivity in the ﬁxed order calculation. This
means that, to a very good extent, for the observable
that we are proposing, the so-called “Monte Carlo mass”
[55, 56] coincides with the pole mass. Although a full
study of our observable in a calculation matching NLO
matrix elements with parton shower is needed to quote a
conclusive number, the study of the sensitivity to the par-
ton shower parameters suggests the diﬀerence between
the two masses is well below the GeV.

IV. B-HADRONS RESULTS

Next, we discuss an extension of the energy-peak
method for top quark mass measurement to B-hadrons.
The correlation between the top quark mass and the b
quark energy from the top decay, as we have seen thus
far, is largely inherited by the b-jet that emerges from
the transition of the b quark into hadrons. Looking into
the b-jet, we can imagine to use a single hadron in the
b-jet (or, at least in principle, another subset of the jet
constituents) and correlate its energy spectrum to the
top quark mass. The use of jet constituents allows us to
avoid experimental systematic uncertainties such as the
jet energy scale, and potentially explore other systematic
uncertainties, most likely theoretical ones associated to
the description of hadronization. On top of providing an
extra handle to understand the systematic uncertainties
of the global set of top quark mass measurements, the
use of sub-sets of the b-jet constituents enables us to de-
vise further observables that can be correlated to the top
quark mass (as also discussed in Ref. [27]). For instance,
restricting to single hadron observables, we can imagine
to measure the peak of the energy of the tracks recon-
structing a B-hadron, the peak of the B-hadron Lorentz
boosts, or the peak of its average life-time in the labora-
tory frame, all of which are quantities expected to inherit
part of the good properties we have observed from b-jets
spectra in the previous section.

In order to assess the potential of the use of B-hadron
spectra for the top quark mass measurement, we investi-
gate the accuracy on mt that can be achieved from sin-
gle B-hadrons energy spectra. We describe the forma-
tion of B-hadrons at NLO in the fragmentation functions
formalism [48], performing a calculation largely analo-
gous to that of Ref. [37] with inputs from [57, 58] for
the parameterizations [59, 60] of the fragmentation func-
tions. With this method we obtain energy spectra for
B-hadrons for each choice of the renormalization, fac-
torization, and fragmentation scales. As in the previ-
ous section, we set them to be equal and spanning the
range [0.5mt, 2mt]. As the energy of the single B-hadron
is always lower than that of the associated b-jet and its
spectrum may also vary considerably with respect to that
of b-jets, we have re-evaluated the details of the ﬁtting
procedure necessary to identify the maximum of the dis-
tribution. We ﬁnd that the same ﬁtting function applied
to the case of b-jets is still successful, but the ﬁt needs

V. CONCLUSIONS

9

In Ref. [28] a theoretical proposal for determining the
top quark mass via a measurement of the position of
the peak in the energy distribution of the b-jets resulting
from its decay was made. In the present paper we elevate
this technique to the precision frontier by computing the
correlation between this energy-peak and the top quark
mass at NLO in QCD. The results presented here reduce
the theory uncertainty on the original method and are
particularly useful for the recent implementation by the
CMS collaboration [25], which was based on LO calcula-
tions. The remaining theory uncertainty from sensitivity
of the b-jet energy spectrum to relevant parameters has
been investigated in detail by studying several variations
of the calculation, including that of jet radii and depen-
dence of the factorization and renormalization scales on
the momenta of the top decay products. The uncertain-
ties from multiple emissions, to be described in the par-
ton shower approximation, have been estimated as well.
The overall result is that the b-jet energy-peak method
can be used to extract the top quark pole mass with an
uncertainty ±(1.2(exp) + 0.6(th)) GeV. Here we have
assumed large statistics so that the experimental uncer-
tainty, which dominates the theory one, comes primarily
from the jet energy scale uncertainty.

The method that we propose can therefore contribute
signiﬁcantly to the precision determination of the top
quark mass at the LHC and especially to the understand-
ing of the systematic uncertainties on the measurements.
This value added by the technique is manifest partly from
the above-quoted error being comparable to that from
the existing methods. Moreover, the underlying idea of
the measurement has certain merits with respect to other
methods. Firstly, our method belongs to the class of mass
measurement methods based on relating the top quark
mass to a kinematical observable. In this approach, the
correlation between the top quark mass and the chosen
observable can be studied in QCD including higher order
corrections, with uncertainties that can be quantiﬁed in
reliable ways, as we did in this work. This implies that
our method, as well as all the others based on a kine-
matical observable, does not suﬀer from some diﬃculties
that are instead typical of “matrix element methods”,
i.e. based on the measurement of all the observed ﬁnal
states, thus requiring knowledge of the complete matrix
element of the SM for top quark production and decay
(e.g. [35]).

Furthermore,

in the landscape of recent proposals
based on kinematical observables, our method emerges
for having reduced sensitivity to details of the production
mechanism of the top quark. This insensitivity arises be-
cause the observable we used, namely the peak of the
energy distribution, has been shown [28] to enjoy a cer-
tain degree of invariance under boost distributions of the
top quark. This characteristic is underscored by the for-
mula for the top quark mass in terms of the observable
in our method, at leading order for an inclusive top de-

to be carried out on a smaller energy range, motivating
us to pick 25 GeV < EB−hadron < 100 GeV. We notice
that it is particularly important to avoid the lowest en-
ergy part of the spectrum, which happens to be aﬀected
by non-perturbative corrections, hence being very sensi-
tive to variations of the scales and to the perturbative
order of the calculation. The prediction for the peak in
the B-hadron energy spectrum as a function of mt is pre-
sented as a band in Figure 5. The solid line is the NLO
prediction for µF = µR = µf r = mt, that is,

ˆEB−hadron = 0.33 · mt − 13 GeV ,

(13)

with δrms = 0.15 GeV. The thickness of the band from
scale variation yields a theoretical uncertainty ±3.5 GeV
on mt. These results are essentially unchanged switching
between the two parametrizations of the fragmentation
functions of [59] and [60].

The comparison with the results from the analysis of b-
jets highlights a loss of the correlation between the physi-
cal observables and the top quark mass, as expected from
the fact that the B-hadron is only a subset of the prod-
ucts of the b quark hadronization. This observation mo-
tivates the investigation of other possible subsets of the
b-jet hadronization, aiming to increase the sensitivity of
the observable to mt still being away from using the full
jet, hence not feeling jet energy scale uncertainties and
possibly reducing the theory uncertainty as well. On this
last point we remark that comparing calculations with
the fragmentation function at LO and NLO, the sensitiv-
ity to variations of only the fragmentation scales reduces
from ±8 GeV to ±4 GeV, hence motivating improvement
to NNLO fragmentation functions in the future.

principles of the kinematics of decay only, regardless of
the production mechanism of the t¯t pair (as long as the
resulting top quarks are unpolarized). On the contrary,
for the other kinematic observables,4 already at leading
order in perturbation theory and in absence of cuts, it is
necessary to carry out a detailed calculation to determine
the correlation with the top quark mass. This means that
a speciﬁc matrix element, e.g. that of the SM, has to be
employed in addition to knowledge of the collider beam
energy and parton distribution functions. The result-
ing advantage of our method over others is hence clear –
the top mass extracted using our observable is subject to
smaller error from higher-order QCD eﬀects in production
and other variations of the production mechanism such
as the parton distribution functions set that is used.

The above expectation is corroborated for instance by
the smaller error on the measured top quark mass associ-
ated with the mis-modelling of the top pT spectrum that
has been reported using the b-jet energy-peak method
by the CMS collaboration in Ref. [25] in comparison to
other methods, e.g. the B-hadron decay length method
Ref. [24]. We remark that the B-hadron decay length is
correlated with the energy of the B-hadron (in turn, with
that of the parent bottom quark) so that (naively) one
would expect that the sensitivities to the above top quark
pT modeling should have been similar in the two meth-
ods. However, the B-hadron decay length analysis does
not take advantage of the energy peak result in its imple-
mentation, because the actual decay length observable
used in this CMS measurement did not correspond ex-
actly to the B-hadron energy-peak being discussed here,
thus it appears justiﬁed that the decay length measure-
ment does not enjoy a reduced sensitivity to production
details.

Relatedly, the method proposed in this work is also
minimally sensitive to additional mechanism of produc-
tion of top quarks from new physics, as for instance stop
pair production and decay into unpolarized pairs of on-
shell top quarks pp → ˜t˜t∗ → t¯tχχ in supersymmetric
extensions of the SM. Therefore, the method that we pro-
pose adds important information to the measurements of
other methods that, still being based on a kinematical ob-
servable, assume the SM production mechanism. On the
ﬂip side, our method has sensitivity to QCD eﬀects and
new physics if they change top quark decay distributions.
This complementarity implies that it is clearly useful to
compare results obtained using our strategy with those
obtained with others.

The method that we discuss also might have reduced
sensitivity to parton showers (PS) and details of their im-
plementation for the following reason [as implied by the
discussion related to Eq. (12)]. Namely, our observable is
mostly aﬀected by hard emissions (in the decay i.e. much

less in the production), which are best described using
the ﬁxed order matrix elements. In any case, due to this
sensitivity also coming mostly from corrections to the de-
cay, we expect the analysis of energy peaks to carry com-
plementary information about the eﬀect of PS to that ob-
tained from other observables which instead (in general)
feel it via both production and decay corrections. Fur-
thermore, using existing NNLO QCD [61, 62] corrections
to the top quark decay it would be possible to keep using
well-deﬁned QFT mass deﬁnition to compute our observ-
able to even higher accuracy. Hence, we can minimize the
contribution of inevitable further emissions and other ef-
fects not described by a ﬁxed order calculation, possibly
attaining a top quark mass measurement free from the
need to talk about a “Monte Carlo mass” [55, 56]. In this
context of assessing the eﬀects of multiple emissions, it is
going also to be useful to perform a study of our observ-
able in a matched NLO-PS calculation [47], which will
be presented elsewhere. Note, however, that the results
presented in this work on the sensitivity of the extracted
mass to variations of the shower parameters clearly indi-
cate that is possible to treat this mass as the pole mass
up to corrections well below the GeV.

As extensions of the measurement methods based on
energy spectra, we anticipate the use of sub-jets and sin-
gle hadron properties (cf., inclusive b-jet above). The
B-hadron energies can be in principle determined free of
jet energy scale, which is the dominant source of exper-
imental uncertainty on many top quark mass measure-
ments (including the energy-peak of b-jets). For exam-
ple, this can be done using only tracker measurements of
the charged decay products of a B-hadron. Therefore,
pursuing a reduction of the experimental error, we have
studied energy spectra of B-hadrons and showed that the
top quark mass can be extracted form these energy-peaks
as well, though with larger uncertainties coming from the
bottom quark fragmentation functions. This theory un-
certainty on the top quark mass measurement from the
B-hadron energy-peak can in principle be reduced us-
ing NNLO fragmentation functions which might become
available in the future. Such an improvement might bring
the methods based on B-hadron energy spectra (in gen-
eral) to a level of accuracy similar to the current ones.

As mentioned above, the CMS collaboration has al-
ready measured the top quark mass using B-hadron de-
cay length as a “proxy” for the energy of the B-hadron.
Although this Run I analysis assumed SM production,
it did ameliorate the jet energy scale uncertainty along
the above lines, as it used (mostly) information from the
tracker. For the Run II measurements, it would then be
interesting to have the best of both worlds by pursuing
a combination of these two ideas, i.e. augment the B-
hadron decay length method by the energy-peak result
so that the resulting method can have reduced sensitiv-
ity to jet energy scale uncertainty and modeling of top
quark production.

In summary, the results of this work demonstrate the
usefulness of energy spectra (in particular, their peaks)

for precision mass measurements and illustrate the pos-
sible beneﬁt of inclusion of this type of analysis in future
combined extraction of the top quark mass at the LHC.
