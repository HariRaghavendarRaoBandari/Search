THE SPHERE PACKING PROBLEM IN DIMENSION 24

HENRY COHN, ABHINAV KUMAR, STEPHEN D. MILLER, DANYLO RADCHENKO,

AND MARYNA VIAZOVSKA

Abstract. Building on Viazovska’s recent solution of the sphere packing
problem in eight dimensions, we prove that the Leech lattice is the densest
packing of congruent spheres in twenty-four dimensions, and that it is the
unique optimal periodic packing. In particular, we ﬁnd an optimal auxiliary
function for the linear programming bounds, which is an analogue of Viazovska’s
function for the eight-dimensional case.

1. Introduction

The sphere packing problem asks how to arrange congruent balls as densely as
possible without overlap. The density is the fraction of space covered by the balls,
and the problem is to ﬁnd the maximal possible density. This problem plays an
important role in geometry, number theory, and information theory. See [4] for
background and references on sphere packing and its applications.

Although many interesting constructions are known, provably optimality is very
rare. Aside from the trivial case of one dimension, the optimal density was previously
known only in two [8], three [6, 7], and eight [9] dimensions, with the latter result
being a recent breakthrough due to Viazovska. Building on her work, we prove the
following theorem:

Theorem 1.1. The Leech lattice achieves the optimal sphere packing density in
R24, and it is the only periodic packing in R24 with that density.

It is unknown in general whether optimal packings have any special structure, but
our theorem shows that they do in R24. For an appealing construction of the Leech
lattice, see Section 2.8 of [5]. Its optimality and uniqueness were previously known
only among lattice packings [2], which is a far more restrictive setting. Recall that
a lattice is a discrete subgroup of Rn of rank n, and a lattice packing uses spheres
centered at the points of a lattice, while periodic packings are unions of ﬁnitely
many translates of lattices. Lattices are far more algebraically constrained, and it is
widely believed that they do not achieve the optimal density in most dimensions (for
example, see [4, p. 140] for an example in R10 of a periodic packing that is denser
than any known lattice). By contrast, periodic packings at least come arbitrarily
close to the optimal sphere packing density.

The proof will be based on the linear programming bounds for sphere packing,

as given by the following theorem.

Theorem 1.2 (Cohn and Elkies [1]). Let f : Rn → Rn be a Schwartz function and

r a positive real number such that f (0) = (cid:98)f (0) = 1, f (x) ≤ 0 for |x| ≥ r, and
(cid:98)f (y) ≥ 0 for all y. Then the sphere packing density in Rn is at most

(cid:16) r

(cid:17)n

2

.

πn/2
(n/2)!

Here (n/2)! means Γ(n/2 + 1) when n is odd, and the Fourier transform is

normalized by

(cid:98)f (y) =

(cid:90)

Rn

f (x)e−2πi(cid:104)x,y(cid:105) dx,

where (cid:104)·,·(cid:105) denotes the usual inner product on R24. Without loss of generality, we

can radially symmetrize f , in which case (cid:98)f is radial as well.

√

Optimizing the bound from Theorem 1.1 requires choosing the right auxiliary
function f . It was not previously known how to do so except in one dimension
[1] or eight [9], but Cohn and Elkies conjectured the existence of an auxiliary
function proving the optimality of the Leech lattice [1]. We prove this conjecture by
developing an analogue for the Leech lattice of Viazovska’s construction for the E8
root lattice.

which requires that f and (cid:98)f have roots on the spheres of radius

In the case of the Leech lattice, proving optimality amounts to achieving r = 2,
2k about the origin
for k = 2, 3, . . . . See [1] for further explanation and discussion of this condition.
Furthermore, Section 8 of [1] shows that if f has no other roots at distance 2 or
more, then the Leech lattice is the unique optimal periodic packing in R24.

The existence of an optimal auxiliary function in R24 has long been anticipated,
and Cohn and Miller made further conjectures in [3] about special values of the
function, which we also prove. Our approach is based on a new connection with
quasimodular forms discovered by Viazovska [9], and our proof techniques are
analogous to hers. In Sections 2 and 3 we will build two radial Fourier eigenfunctions
in R24, one with eigenvalue 1 constructed using a quasimodular form of weight −8
and depth 2 for SL2(Z), and one with eigenvalue −1 constructed using a weakly
holomorphic modular form of weight −10 for the congruence subgroup Γ(2). We
will then take a linear combination of these eigenfunctions in Section 4 to construct
the optimal auxiliary function.

We will make free use of the standard deﬁnitions and notation for modular forms
from [9, 10]. We will also tacitly identify radial functions on R24 with functions on
[0,∞) and vice versa. All Fourier transforms will be in R24.

2. The +1 eigenfunction

As in [9], we begin by constructing a radial eigenfunction for the Fourier transform

in R24 with eigenvalue 1 in terms of a certain quasimodular form ϕ. Let

(2.1)

ϕ =

(25E4

= −3657830400q − 314573414400q2 − 13716864000000q3 + O(q4).

As mentioned in the introduction, we follow the notation of [9]. In particular, Ek
denotes the Eisenstein series (normalized to have constant term 1) and q = e2πiz,

where our variable z lies in the upper half plane. Note that we normalize ∆ by

∆ =

= q − 24q2 + O(q3).

This function ϕ is a quasimodular form of weight −8 and depth 2 for the full

modular group. Speciﬁcally, because

we have the quasimodularity relation

Lemma 2.1. The function r (cid:55)→ a(r) analytically continues to a function on a
neighborhood of R. This function is a Schwartz function and a radial eigenfunction
of the Fourier transform in R24 with eigenvalue 1.

COHN, KUMAR, MILLER, RADCHENKO, AND VIAZOVSKA

Proof. We follow the approach of [9], adapted to use modular forms of diﬀerent
weight. Substituting −4 sin(πr2/2)2 = eπir2 − 2 + e−πir2

where we have shifted contours as in the proof of Proposition 2 in [9]. Now the
quasimodularity relation (2.2) and periodicity modulo 1 show that

ϕ(−1/(z + 1))(z + 1)10 − 2ϕ(−1/z)z10 + ϕ(−1/(z − 1))(z − 1)10

= ϕ(z + 1)(z + 1)2 − 2ϕ(z)z2 + ϕ(z − 1)(z − 1)2

which gives the analytic continuation of a to a neighborhood of R by (2.3) and (2.4).
Essentially the same estimates as in Proposition 1 of [9] show that it is a Schwartz

Taking the 24-dimensional radial Fourier transform amounts to replacing eπir2z

with z−12eπir2(−1/z), and therefore

ϕ(−1/(z + 1))(z + 1)10z−12eπir2(−1/z) dz

Appendix A. Inequalities for modular forms

The proof in Section 4 requires checking certain inequalities for modular and
quasimodular forms on the imaginary axis. Fortunately, they are not too delicate,
and we can verify them by systematic approximation and bounding. In this appendix,
we explain how to do so. In each case, we approximate the modular form using
q-series and prove error bounds for truncating the series (which we then incorporate
by adding them to a term of the series). The truncated series is nearly a polynomial
in q, with the possible exceptions being factors of t (where z = it), and we bound
those factors so as to reduce to the case of a polynomial in q. Furthermore, we
bound any factors of π so that the coeﬃcients become rational. Finally, we use
Sturm’s theorem with exact rational arithmetic to verify that the truncated series
never changes sign.

To prove the error bounds, we need to control the growth of the coeﬃcients.
We ﬁrst multiply by ∆2 to clear the denominators that appear in (2.1), (3.1), and
(3.2). The advantage of doing so is that the coeﬃcients of the numerator grow only
polynomially. To estimate the growth rate, we bound the coeﬃcient of qn in E2 by
24(n + 1)2 in absolute value, in E4 by 240(n + 1)4, and in E6 by 504(n + 1)6. It is
also not diﬃcult to show that the coeﬃcient of qn/2 in Θ4
10 is at most
24(n + 1)2 in absolute value.1 Multiplying series is straightforward: if |an| ≤ (n + 1)(cid:96)

and |bn| ≤ (n + 1)m, then the coeﬃcients of (cid:0)(cid:80)

n anqn(cid:1)(cid:0)(cid:80)

01 or Θ4

n bnqn(cid:1) are bounded

00, Θ4

by (n + 1)(cid:96)+m+1. When we add two q-series with coeﬃcients bounded by diﬀerent
powers of n + 1, we typically round up the lower power for simplicity. Using these
techniques leads to explicit polynomial bounds for the coeﬃcients of ϕ∆2, ψI ∆2,
and ψS∆2 by using their deﬁnitions in terms of Eisenstein series and Thetanullwerte.
These bounds are ineﬃcient, but they suﬃce for our purposes.
When t ≥ 1, q = e−2πt is small enough that these coeﬃcient bounds yield a
reasonable error term. When t ≤ 1, we replace it with 1/t (via z (cid:55)→ −1/z) and
compute the corresponding q-expansion.

Lemma A.1. For t > 0,

ϕ(it) < 0.

Proof. First, we prove this inequality for t ≥ 1, in which case q = e−2πt < 1/535.
The bounds described above show that the coeﬃcient of qn in ϕ∆2 is at most
513200655360(n + 1)20, and exact computation shows that

Thus, the sum of the terms in ϕ∆2 for n ≥ 50 amounts to at most 10−50q6. Let
σ be the sum of the terms with n < 50. We use Sturm’s theorem to check that
σ + 10−50q6 never changes sign on (0, 1/535) as a polynomial in q, and we observe
that it is negative in the limit as q → 0. This proves that ϕ(it) < 0 for t ≥ 1.

Using (2.8), the bound for t ≤ 1 is equivalent to showing that

−t2ϕ(it) + itϕ1(it) + ϕ2(it) > 0

1Both Θ4

00 and Θ4

10 have nonnegative coeﬃcients, and their sum is the theta series of the
D4 root lattice in the variable q1/2, from which one can bound their coeﬃcients. Furthermore,

THE SPHERE PACKING PROBLEM IN DIMENSION 24

we similarly use the bounds 1 ≤ t ≤ 1/(cid:0)23q1/2(cid:1); the latter bound follows from

for t ≥ 1. Again we multiply by ∆2 to control the coeﬃcients. This case is
more complicated, because there are factors of t and π. We replace factors of π
with rational bounds, namely (cid:98)1010π(cid:99) or (cid:100)1010π(cid:101) based on the sign of the term
and whether it is a positive power of π (so that we obtain a lower bound), and
q = e−2πt and te−πt ≤ e−π ≤ 1/23. To estimate the error bound from truncation,
we use q1/2 < 1/23; the result is that the error from omitting the qn terms with
n ≥ 50 is at most 10−50q6. These observations reduce the problem to showing that
a polynomial in q1/2 with rational coeﬃcients is positive over the interval (0, e−π).
Using Sturm’s theorem, we check that it holds over the larger interval (0, 1/23). (cid:3)

Note that we could have avoided fractional powers of q in this proof if we had
used a diﬀerent upper bound for t, but ψS and ψI already involve such terms,
and so we must be prepared to handle them. We will use the bounds such as

1 ≤ t ≤ 1/(cid:0)23q1/2(cid:1) from the preceding proof systematically in the remaining proofs.

Lemma A.2. For t > 0,

ϕ(it) − 432

π2 ψS(it) > 0.

Proof. We use exactly the same technique as in the proof of Lemma A.1. For t ≥ 1,
removing the q50 and higher terms in the q-series for (ϕ−432ψS/π2)∆2 introduces an
error of at most 10−50q6, and Sturm’s theorem shows that the resulting polynomial
has no sign changes. Note that ψS involves powers of q1/2, and so we must view the
truncated series as a polynomial in q1/2 rather than q.
For t ≤ 1, we apply relations (2.2) and (3.2) to reduce the problem to showing

that

−t2ϕ(it) + itϕ1(it) + ϕ2(it) − 432

π2 ψI (it) < 0

for t ≥ 1. When we multiply by ∆2 and remove the q50 and higher terms, the error
bound is at most 10−50q6, and Sturm’s theorem completes the proof. As in the
previous proof, this case involves handling factors of t and π, but they present no
(cid:3)
diﬃculties.

Of course these proofs are by no means optimized. Instead, they were chosen to

be straightforward and easy to describe.

The ﬁnal inequality we must verify is (4.5):

Lemma A.3. For all t ≥ 1,

B(t) ≥ 1
39

te2πt − 10
117π

e2πt.

Proof. As usual, we multiply

B(t) −

(cid:18) 1

(cid:19)

te2πt − 10
117π

e2πt

39

by ∆2 and compute its q-series. Our usual truncation bounds show that removing
the q50 and higher terms introduces an error bound of at most 10−50q6, and Sturm’s
(cid:3)
theorem again completes the proof.
