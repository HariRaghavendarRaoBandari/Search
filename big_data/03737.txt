A HUKUHARA APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF

HYBRID FUZZY SYSTEMS ON TIME SCALES

Omid S. Fard, Delﬁm F. M. Torres, Mohadeseh R. Zadeh

We introduce a new approach to study the practical stability of hybrid fuzzy
systems on time scales in the Lyapunov sense. Our method is based on the
delta-Hukuhara derivative for fuzzy valued functions and allow us to obtain
new interesting stability criteria. We also show the validity of the results of
M. Sambandham: Hybrid fuzzy systems on time scales, Dynam. Systems
Appl. 12 (2003), no. 1-2, 217–227, by embedding the space of all fuzzy
subsets into a suitable Banach space.

1. INTRODUCTION

In natural systems engineering, the lowest level in the hierarchical structure
is usually characterized by the dynamics of a continuous variable while the highest
level is described by a logical decision making mechanism [8]. The interaction of
these diﬀerent levels, with their diﬀerent types of information, leads to a hybrid sys-
tem. Examples of real world hybrid systems include systems with relays, switches,
hysteresis, disk drivers, transmissions, step motors, constrained robots, automated
transportation systems, modern manufacturing and ﬂight control systems [22].

The mathematical modeling of dynamic processes is often discussed in the
literature via diﬀerence or diﬀerential equations. In spite of this tendency of in-
dependence between discrete and continuous dynamic systems, there is a striking
similarity between both theories. From a modeling point of view, it is perhaps
more realistic to model a phenomenon by a dynamic system, which incorporates
both discrete and continuous times simultaneously, namely by considering time as
an arbitrary closed set of reals, called a time scale. The theory of time scales was

introduced in 1988 by Stefan Hilger and is now a well-developed subject [6, 7].
Here we use dynamic systems on time scales as a model to hybrid systems. Moti-
vation comes from the fact that hybrid systems refer to the construction of models
combining both continuous and discrete dynamics. They are useful for describing
the interaction between physical and computational processes, such as in digital
feedback control systems [16].

In the study of stability of dynamical systems, Lyapunov functions play a
central role in the proof of stability of equilibrium points on the state space [3].
Moreover, since practical stability only requires to stabilize a system into a region of
the phase space, Lyapunov functions have been widely used in applications. More
precisely, when one intends to analyze a real world phenomenon, it is also neces-
sary to deal with uncertain factors. In this case, the theory of fuzzy sets is one of
the best non-statistical or non-probabilistic approach, which leads us to investigate
stability of fuzzy dynamical models. In recent years, the use of hybrid fuzzy sys-
tems has increased drastically. For instance, Kim and Sakthivel [12] studied the
predictor-corrector method for hybrid fuzzy diﬀerential equations, Nieto et al. [17]
and Allahviranloo and Salahshour [2] investigated the numerical solution of (hy-
brid) fuzzy diﬀerential equations using a generalized Euler approximation method,
and Ahmadian et al.
[1] employed a numerical algorithm to solve a ﬁrst-order
hybrid fuzzy diﬀerential equation based on the high-order Runge–Kutta method.
Particularly for hybrid fuzzy systems on time scales, the theory of practical stabil-
ity has developed rather intensively in the last few years – see [11, 15, 19, 21, 23]
and references therein.

In [15], Lakshmikantham and Vatsala investigated practical stability of hy-
brid systems on time scales. The results of [15] were then extended by Sambandham
for hybrid fuzzy systems on time scales [19]. In [21], Lyapunov-like functions for
hybrid dynamic equations on time scales with the state space Rn are studied using
Dini derivatives and comparison principles. Related studies are found in [23], for
incremental stability of stochastic hybrid systems, in [11] for practical stability of
discrete hybrid systems with diﬀerent initial times, and in [20] for stability analysis
of abstract Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy impulsive systems.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to investigate practical stability
of hybrid fuzzy systems on time scales. Our method is more general, being based
on the use of the delta-Hukuhara derivative, which has recently been deﬁned for
fuzzy valued functions [10]. After a short review of this calculus of fuzzy functions
on time scales in Section , we prove new stability criteria in Section . We proceed
with Section 3.2, where an inconsistency in [19] is noted and ﬁxed, ending with
Section 3.2 of conclusions.

2. PRELIMINARIES

In this section, we present some basic concepts and results on the calculus of
fuzzy functions on time scales. We assume, however, the reader to be familiar with
the standard calculus on time scales [6, 7].

A Hukuhara approach to the study of hybrid fuzzy systems on time scales

Deﬁnition 2.1 (Upper ∆-Dini derivative [15]). Let T be a time scale with forward
jump operator σ, f : T → R be a real valued function, and UT be a neighborhood
of t ∈ T. We call D+
∆f (t) ∈ R the upper ∆-Dini derivative (or upper ∆-generalized
derivative) of f at t, provided that for any ε > 0 there exists a right neighborhood
Uε ⊂ UT of t (i.e., Uε = (t, t + ε) ∩ T) such that

f (σ(t)) − f (s)

µ∗(t, s)

< D+

∆f (t) + ε

for s ∈ Uε and s > t, where µ∗(t, s) = σ(t) − s.

Proposition 2.2 (See [15]). Let T be a time scale with forward jump operator σ
and graininess function µ. If f : T → R is a continuous function at t ∈ T and t is
right-scattered, then the upper ∆-Dini derivative of f coincides with the standard
delta-derivative:

D+

∆f (t) = f ∆(t) =

µ(t)

f (σ(t)) − f (t)

.

Deﬁnition 2.3 (Fuzzy set [5]). Let X be a nonempty set. A fuzzy set u in X is
characterized by its membership function u : X → [0, 1]. Then, for each x ∈ X
we interpret u(x) as the degree of membership of the element x in the fuzzy set u:
u(x) = 0 corresponded to non membership; 0 < u(x) < 1 to partial membership;
and u(x) = 1 to full membership.

Deﬁnition 2.4 (The space of fuzzy numbers RF – see, e.g., [19]). We denote by
RF the class of fuzzy subsets of the real axis u : R → [0, 1] satisfying the following
properties:

(i) u is normal, i.e., there exists x0 ∈ R with u(x0) = 1;

(ii) u is a convex fuzzy set, i.e., u(kx+(1−k)y) ≥ min{u(x), u(y)} for all k ∈ [0, 1]

and x, y ∈ R;

(iii) u is upper semicontinuous on R;

(iv) {x ∈ R : u(x) > 0} is compact, where A denotes the closure of a set A.

We call RF the space of fuzzy numbers.

Clearly, R ⊂ RF (because R is understood as R = {χx : x is a real number}).

For later purposes, we deﬁnee0 = χ{0}, that is,e0 is the fuzzy set deﬁned bye0(x) = 1
if x = 0 ande0(x) = 0 if x 6= 0.

Deﬁnition 2.5 (The α-level set [5]). For 0 < α 6 1, the α-level set [u]α of a fuzzy
set u on R is deﬁned as

while its support [u]0 is the closure of the union of all the level sets, that is,

[u]α = {x ∈ R : u(x) ≥ α},

[u]0 = [α∈(0,1]

[u]α = {x ∈ R : u(x) > 0}.

4

Omid S. Fard, Delﬁm F. M. Torres, Mohadeseh R. Zadeh

Remark 2.6. For any α ∈ [0, 1], [v]α is a bounded closed interval in R, presented
by [v]α = [vα, vα], where vα, vα ∈ R.

For u, v ∈ RF and λ ∈ R, the sum of two fuzzy numbers and the multiplication

between a real and a fuzzy number are deﬁned respectively by

[u ⊕ v]α = [u]α + [v]α = {x + y : x ∈ [u]α, y ∈ [v]α}

and

[λ · u]α = λ[u]α = {λx : x ∈ [u]α}

for all α ∈ [0, 1], where [u]α + [v]α is the usual addition of two intervals of R and
λ[u]α is the usual product of a number and a subset of R.

Deﬁnition 2.7 (The gH-diﬀerence [10]). Given u, v ∈ RF , the gH-diﬀerence is the
fuzzy number w, if it exists, such that

u ⊖gH v = w ⇔ u = v ⊕ w or v = u ⊕ (−1) · w.

Remark 2.8. If u ⊖gH v exists, then its α-level set is given by

[u ⊖gH v]α = [min {uα − vα, uα − vα} , max {uα − vα, uα − vα}] .

Let A and B be two nonempty bounded subsets of a metric space (X, d). The

Hausdorﬀ distance between A and B is given by

(1)

dH (A, B) = max(cid:20)sup

a∈A

inf
b∈B

d(a, b), sup
b∈B

inf
a∈A

d(b, a)(cid:21) .

Deﬁnition 2.9 (Hausdorﬀ distance between two fuzzy numbers). The Hausdorﬀ
distance between two fuzzy numbers is the function d∞ : RF × RF → R+ ∪ {0}
deﬁned in terms of the Hausdorﬀ distance between their level sets, that is,

d∞(u, v) = sup {dH ([u]α, [v]α) : α ∈ [0, 1]} .

Proposition 2.10 (See [9]). The pair (RF , d∞) is a complete metric space and
the following properties hold:

(i) d∞(u ⊕ w, v ⊕ w) = d∞(u, v) for all u, v, w ∈ RF ;

(ii) d∞(k · u, k · v) = |k|d∞(u, v) for all u, v ∈ RF and for all k ∈ R;

(iii) d∞(u ⊕ v, w ⊕ e) ≤ d∞(u, w) + d∞(v, e) for all u, v, w, e ∈ RF .

Deﬁnition 2.11 (The set of rd-continuous functions from T to RF [10]). A map-
ping f : T → RF is rd-continuous if it is continuous at each right-dense point
and its left-side limits exist (ﬁnite) at left-dense points in T. We denote the set of
rd-continuous functions from T to RF by Crd[T, RF ].

A Hukuhara approach to the study of hybrid fuzzy systems on time scales

Deﬁnition 2.12 (The ∆-Hukuhara derivative of f at t [10]). Assume f : T → RF
is a fuzzy function and let t ∈ Tκ. Let ∆H f (t) be an element of RF (provided it
exists) with the property that given any ε > 0, there exists a neighborhood UT of
t (i.e., UT = (t − δ, t + δ) ∩ T for some δ > 0) such that

d∞ [f (t + h) ⊖gH f (σ(t)), ∆H f (t)(h − µ(t))] ≤ ε(h − µ(t))

and

d∞ [f (σ(t)) ⊖gH f (t − h), ∆H f (t)(µ(t) + h)] ≤ ε(µ(t) + h)

for all t − h, t + h ∈ UT with 0 ≤ h < δ. We call ∆H f (t) the ∆-Hukuhara derivative
of f at t. We say that f is ∆H -diﬀerentiable at t if its ∆H -derivative exists at t.
Moreover, we say that f is ∆H -diﬀerentiable on Tκ if its ∆H -derivative exists at
each t ∈ Tκ. The fuzzy function ∆H f : Tκ → RF is then called the ∆H -derivative
of f on Tκ.

The next result shows that the ∆H -derivative is well deﬁned.

Proposition 2.13 (See [10]). If the ∆H -derivative of f at t ∈ Tκ exists, then it
is unique.

Theorem 2.14 (See [10]). Let T be an arbitrary time scale and consider a function
f : T → RF . Then, the following holds for all t ∈ Tκ:

(i) If f is continuous at t and t is right-scattered, then f is ∆H -diﬀerentiable at

t with

∆H f (t) =

f (σ(t)) ⊖gH f (t)

µ(t)

.

(ii) If t is right-dense, then f is ∆H -diﬀerentiable at t if and only if both limits

lim
h→0+

f (t + h) ⊖gH f (t)

h

and

lim
h→0+

f (t) ⊖gH f (t − h)

h

exist and satisfy the equalities

lim
h→0+

f (t + h) ⊖gH f (t)

h

= lim
h→0+

f (t) ⊖gH f (t − h)

h

= ∆H f (t).

Let us denote by Rn

F the space of all fuzzy subsets u of Rn that satisfy the

assumptions

(i) u maps Rn onto I = [0, 1];

(ii) u is fuzzy convex;

(iii) u is upper semicontinuous;

(iv) [u]0 is a compact subset of Rn.

and limy→x f (t, y) = f (t, x) (i.e., for all ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that

dense.

We investigate the practical stability of hybrid fuzzy systems on time scales,

deﬁned through delta-Hukuhara derivatives. Consider the fuzzy dynamic system

Deﬁnition 3.17. Let V ∈ Crd[T × Rn
∆V (t, u(t)) ∈ R is the
upper ∆-Dini derivative of V (t, u(t)) with respect to (2), if for any given ε > 0
there exists a right neighborhood Uε of t ∈ T such that

Proof. Because of continuity of V at t,

lim
s→t+

=

V(cid:0)σ(t), u(σ(t))(cid:1) − V(cid:0)s, u(σ(t)) ⊖gH µ∗(t, s)f (t, u(t))(cid:1)
V(cid:0)σ(t), u(σ(t))(cid:1) − V(cid:0)t, u(σ(t)) ⊖gH µ(t)∆H u(t)(cid:1)

σ(t) − s

µ(t)

.

Since u is continuous at t and t is right-scattered, it follows from item (i) of Theo-
rem 2.14 that

lim
s→t+

V(cid:0)σ(t), u(σ(t))(cid:1) − V(cid:0)s, u(σ(t)) ⊖gH µ∗(t, s)f (t, u(t))(cid:1)

σ(t) − s

=

V(cid:0)σ(t), u(σ(t))(cid:1) − V(cid:0)t, u(t)(cid:1)

µ(t)

.

From this last equality, we get that for a given ε > 0 there exists a right neighbor-
hood Uε ⊆ T of t such that

1

µ∗(t, s)(cid:2)V(cid:0)σ(t), u(σ(t))(cid:1) − V(cid:0)s, u(σ(t)) ⊖gH f (t, u(t))(cid:1)(cid:3)

−

Consequently,

V(cid:0)σ(t), u(σ(t))(cid:1) − V(cid:0)t, u(t)(cid:1)

µ(t)

< ε.

µ∗(t, s)(cid:2)V(cid:0)σ(t), u(σ(t))(cid:1) − V(cid:0)s, u(σ(t)) ⊖gH f (t, u(t))(cid:1)(cid:3)

<

V(cid:0)σ(t), u(σ(t))(cid:1) − V(cid:0)t, u(t)(cid:1)

µ(t)

+ ε.

This means that (V (σ(t), u(σ(t))) − V (t, u(t))) /µ(t) is the upper ∆-Dini derivative
of V (t, u(t)).

Theorem 3.19. Assume that

(i) V ∈ Crd[T × Rn

F , R+], V (t, u) is locally Lipshitzian in u for each right-dense
t ∈ T (i.e., ∃ L > 0 such that |V (t, u1) − V (t, u2)| < L D∞(u1, u2) for all
u1, u2 ∈ Rn

F );

(ii) D+

∆V (t, u(t)) ≤ g (t, V (t, u(t))), where g ∈ Crd[T × R+, R] and g(t, r)µ(t) + r

is nondecreasing in r for each t ∈ T;

(iii) r(t) = r(t, t0, r0) is the maximal solution of r∆(t) = g (t, r(t)), r(t0) = r0 ≥ 0,

existing on T.

Then, V (t0, u0) ≤ r0 implies that V (t, u(t)) ≤ r(t, t0, r0) for all t ∈ T, t ≥ t0.

Proof. The proof is similar to the one of [14, Theorem 3.1.1].

3.1 A comparison theorem

We now establish a comparison result (Theorem 3.20), which is useful to prove
practical stability (Theorem 3.23). Because of the local nature of the solution u(t),
stability properties are proved with respect to one condition on the Lyapunov-like
function V (t, u(t)) that is deﬁned only on T × S(ρ),

(3)

S(ρ) =nu ∈ Rn

F : D∞(u,e0) < ρo .

Let T be a nonnegative unbounded time scale with tk ∈ T, k ∈ N0, satisfying
0 ≤ t0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tk < · · · and tk → ∞ as k → ∞. We consider the
following hybrid fuzzy dynamic system:

(4)

∆H u(t) = f (t, u(t), λ(t, u(t))) ,

t ≥ t0,

t ∈ T,

u(t0) = u0 ∈ S(ρ),

where f ∈ Crd[T × S(ρ) × Rn
F is
a piecewise constant function deﬁned by λ(t, u(t)) = λk(tk, u(tk)) for t ∈ [tk, tk+1],
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .. If a solution u(t) to system (4) exists, then it can be written as a
piecewise function:

F ], S(ρ) is given by (3), and λ : T × Rn

F → Rn

F , Rn

(5)

u(t) = u(t, t0, u0) = uk(t),

tk ≤ t ≤ tk+1,

k = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

with uk(t) = uk(t, tk, uk) being the solution of ∆H u(t) = f (t, u(t), λk (tk, uk)),
uk = u(tk) ∈ S(ρ), tk ≤ t ≤ tk+1, k ∈ N0. We also consider the scalar comparison
delta hybrid dynamic system

(6)

r∆(t) = g (t, r(t), ψ(r(t))) ,

t ≥ t0,

t ∈ T,

r(t0) = r0 ∈ R+,

where g ∈ Crd[T × R+ × R+, R] and ψ : R+ → R+ is a piecewise constant function:
ψ(r(t)) = ψk(r(tk)), t ∈ [tk, tk+1], k = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Note that a piecewise function

(7)

r(t) = r(t, t0, r0) = rk(t),

tk ≤ t ≤ tk+1,

k = 0, 1, 2, . . .

is a maximal solution of (6) if and only if rk(t) = r(t, tk, rk) is maximal solution of

r∆(t) = g (t, r(t), ψk(rk)) ,

rk = r(tk),

tk ≤ t ≤ tk+1,

k = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

Now, we state and prove a comparison theorem with respect to a Lyapunov-like
function V . Here, the Lyapunov-like function V serves as a vehicle to transform
the ∆-Hukuhara hybrid fuzzy dynamic system (4) into a scalar comparison delta
hybrid dynamic system (6), being enough to consider the stability properties of the
simpler comparison system (6).

Theorem 3.20. Let V ∈ Crd[T × S(ρ), R+] be such that:

(i) V (t, u) is locally Lipshitzian in u for each right-dense t ∈ T, tk ≤ t ≤ tk+1,

k = 0, 1, 2, . . .;

(ii) D+

∆V (t, u(t)) ≤ g(t, V (t, u(t)), ψk(V (tk, uk))), where g ∈ Crd[T×R+×R+, R],
ψk : R+ → R+, g(t, r, v)µ(t)+r is nondecreasing in r for each (t, v), and ψk(v)
and g(t, r, v) are nondecreasing in v.

Moreover, let

(iii) r(t) given by (7) be the maximal solution of the scalar comparison hybrid

dynamic system (6), which we assume to exist for each t ≥ t0, t ∈ T.

If u(t) given by (5) is a solution of the hybrid fuzzy dynamic system (4) with
V (t0, u0) ≤ r0, then

(8)

V (t, u(t)) ≤ r(t) for all t ≥ t0,

t ∈ T.

Remark 3.21. Note that by (5), inequality (8) implies that V (t, uk(t)) ≤ rk(t),
tk ≤ t ≤ tk+1, for all k ∈ N0.

Proof. Let u(t) be a solution of (4) on [t0, ∞) ∩ T. Set m(t) = V (t, u(t)). Then,

m(σ(t)) − m(t)

µ(t)

=

V (σ(t), u(σ(t))) − V (t, u(t))

µ(t)

.

Moreover, by condition (ii), the inequality

D+

∆m(t) ≤ g(t, V (t, u(t)), ψk(V (tk, uk))) = g (t, m(t), ψk(mk))

is obtained for tk ≤ t ≤ tk+1, where mk = V (tk, uk). First, consider t ∈ [t0, t1] ∩ T.
Since m(t0) = V (t0, u0) ≤ r0, by Theorem 3.19 we conclude that

(9)

V (t, u0(t)) ≤ r0(t, t0, r0),

t0 ≤ t ≤ t1,

where u0(t) = u0(t, t0, u0) is the solution of

∆H u0(t) = f (t, u0(t), λ0(t0, u0)), u0(t0) = u0,

t0 ≤ t ≤ t1,

and r0(t) = r0(t, t0, r0) is the maximal solution of

r∆
0 (t) = g(t, r0(t), ψ0(r0)),

r0(t0) = r0,

t0 ≤ t ≤ t1.

Now, choose u1 = u0(t1). Then,

D+

∆m(t) ≤ g (t, m(t), ψ1(m1)) ,

t1 ≤ t ≤ t2,

where m1 = m(t1) = V (t1, u0(t1)). On the other hand, the inequality (9) gives us

V (t1, u0(t1)) ≤ r0(t1, t0, r0).

10

Omid S. Fard, Delﬁm F. M. Torres, Mohadeseh R. Zadeh

Set r0(t1, t0, r0) = r1. Due to the monotone property of ψ1 and g(t, r, v) in v,

D+

∆m(t) ≤ g(t, m(t), ψ1(r1))

m(t) ≤ r1,

t ∈ [t1, t2].

and

Similarly,

V (t, u1(t)) ≤ r1(t, t1, r1),

t ∈ [t1, t2],

is established, where u1(t) = u1(t, t1, u1) is the solution of

∆H u1(t) = f (t, u1(t), λ1(t1, u1)), u1(t1) = u1,

t1 ≤ t ≤ t2,

and r1(t) = r1(t, t1, r1) is the maximal solution of

r∆
1 (t) = g(t, r1(t), ψ1(r1)),

r1(t1) = r1,

t1 ≤ t ≤ t2.

By repeating the process and using the special choice

uk = uk−1(tk),

k = 1, 2, . . . ,

we have

V (t, uk(t)) ≤ rk(t, tk, rk),

tk ≤ t ≤ tk+1,

where uk(t) = uk(t, tk, uk) is the solution of

∆H uk(t) = f (t, uk(t), λk(tk, uk)), uk(tk) = uk,

tk ≤ t ≤ tk+1,

and rk(t) = rk(t, tk, rk) is the maximal solution of

r∆
k (t) = g (t, rk(t), ψk(rk)) ,

rk(tk) = rk,

tk ≤ t ≤ tk+1,

with rk−1(tk) = rk−1(tk, tk−1, rk−1) = rk for each k = 2, 3, . . . By means of these
inequalities, we end with the desired result.

3.2 A criterium for practical stability

Now, we provide a suﬃcient condition for practical stability of the ∆-Hukuhara
hybrid fuzzy dynamic system (4). The deﬁnitions of practical stability for (4) are
similar to the corresponding notions of practical stability for the scalar comparison
delta hybrid dynamic system (6) [15].

Deﬁnition 3.22. The hybrid fuzzy dynamic system (4) is

• practically stable if, for given λ, A ∈ R+ with 0 < λ < A,

(10)

t ∈ T, where u(t) is any solution (5) of (4);

D∞(u0,e0) < λ ⇒ D∞(u(t),e0) < A ∀ t ≥ t0,

A Hukuhara approach to the study of hybrid fuzzy systems on time scales

11

• practically quasi-stable if, for given (λ, B, T0) > 0 such that t0 + T0 ∈ T,

(11)

D∞(u0,e0) < λ ⇒ D∞(u(t),e0) < B ∀ t ≥ t0 + T0,

t ∈ T, where u(t) is any solution (5) of (4);

• strongly practically stable if both (10) and (11) hold;

• practically asymptotically stable if (10) holds and for any ε > 0 there exists

T0 > 0 such that t0 + T0 ∈ T and D∞(u0,e0) < λ implies D∞(u(t),e0) < A for

all t ≥ t0 + T0 in the time scale T, where u(t) is any solution (5) of (4).

Theorem 3.23. Assume that 0 < λ < A. Let

(i) V ∈ Crd[T× S(A), R+], V (t, u) be locally Lipshitzian in u for each right-dense

t ∈ T, tk ≤ t ≤ tk+1, k = 0, 1, 2, . . .;

(ii) D+

∆V (t, u(t)) ≤ g(t, V (t, u(t)), ψk(V (tk, uk))), where g ∈ Crd[T×R+ ×R+, R],
ψk : R+ → R+, g(t, r, v)µ(t)+r is nondecreasing in r for each (t, v), and ψk(v)
and g(t, r, v) are nondecreasing in v;

(iii) V (t, u) satisﬁes

b(D∞(u,e0)) ≤ V (t, u) ≤ a(D∞(u,e0)),

where a, b ∈ K := {f ∈ C[R+, R+] : f (x) is increasing and f (0) = 0}, and
a(λ) < b(A).

(t, u) ∈ T × S(A),

Then, any practical stability property (practically stable, practically quasi-stable,
strongly practically stable or practically asymptotically stable) of the scalar compar-
ison delta hybrid dynamic system (6), imply the corresponding practical stability
property of the ∆-Hukuhara hybrid fuzzy dynamic system (4) (see Deﬁnition 3.22).

Proof. First, suppose that the scalar comparison hybrid dynamic system (6) is
practically stable. It follows that for given a(λ), b(A) ∈ R+ we have

(12)

0 ≤ r0 < a(λ) =⇒ r(t, t0, r0) < b(A),

t ≥ t0,

t ∈ T,

solution of (4). Assume, to the contrary, that there exists a t1 ≥ t0 and a solution

where r(t) = r(t, t0, r0) is a solution of (6). Consider D∞(u0,e0) < λ. Now,
we assert that D∞(u(t),e0) < A, t ≥ t0, t ∈ T, where u(t) = u(t, t0, u0) is a
u(t) = u(t, t0, u0) with D∞(u0,e0) < λ such that
This implies that V (t1, u(t1)) ≥ b(D∞(u0,e0)) ≥ b(A). Choose V (t0, u0) = r0 and

D∞(u(t1),e0) ≥ A and D∞(u(t),e0) < A,

make the special choice of uk and rk as in the proof of Theorem 3.20, to arrive at

t0 ≤ t < t1.

V (t, u(t)) ≤ r(t, t0, V (t0, u0)),

t0 ≤ t < t1.

12

Thus,

b(A) ≤ b(D∞(u0,e0)) ≤ V (t1, u(t1)) ≤ r(t1, t0, V (t0, u0))
≤ r(t1, t0, a(D∞(u0,e0))) ≤ r(t1, t0, a(λ)) < b(A).

This contradiction proves that the hybrid fuzzy dynamic system (4) is practically
stable. Note that the last inequality arises from relation (12). Secondly, we prove
that the hybrid fuzzy dynamic system (4) is practically quasi-stable, if the scalar
comparison hybrid dynamic system (6) is practically quasi-stable. Due to quasi-
stability of (6), we deduce that

0 ≤ r0 < a(λ) =⇒ r(t, t0, r0) < b(B),

t ≥ t0 + T0,

t, t0 + T0 ∈ T,

where r(t) = r(t, t0, r0) is a solution of (6). Suppose that D∞(u0,e0) < λ. From

Theorem 3.20, V (t, u(t)) ≤ r(t, t0, V (t0, u0)), t ≥ t0. Set V (t0, u0) = r0. Then,

b(cid:16)D∞(u(t),e0)(cid:17) ≤ V (t, u(t)) ≤ r(t, t0, V (t0, u0))

≤ r(t, t0, a(D∞(u0,e0))) ≤ r (t, t0, a(λ)) < b(B)

for all t ≥ t0 + T0. Because b is an increasing function, D∞(u(t),e0) < B and,

therefore, we have practical quasi-stability of (4). The strongly practically stability
of (4) is obvious; practical asymptotic stability of (4) is proved similarly.

We illustrate the applicability of Theorem 3.23 with an example. Recall
that a function p : T → R is called regressive provided 1 + µ(t)p(t) 6= 0 for all
t ∈ Tκ. For given regressive functions p and q, the “circle plus” and “circle minus”
operations are deﬁned, respectively, by p ⊕r q = p + q + µpq, p ⊖r q = p−q
1+µq ,
and ⊖rp = 0 ⊖r p (see, e.g., [6]). It is easy to check that p ⊕r (⊖rq) = p ⊖r q,
⊖r(⊖rp) = p, p ⊖r q = ⊖r(q ⊖r p), and p ⊖r p = 0. Note that ⊖r1 = 0 ⊖r 1 = −1
1+µ .
For convenience, we denote ⊖r1 by ⊖r.

Now we are ready to illustrate our approach with a simple example of a hybrid

fuzzy dynamic system on time scales.

Example 3.1. Let us consider the following hybrid fuzzy dynamic system on the
time scale T = N0:

(13)

△H u(t) = ⊖ru(t) ⊕ η(t)λk(uk),

t ∈ [τk, τk+1],

u(τk) = uk ∈ S(ρ),

k = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

where η(t) = 1

1+µ(t) and

λk(τ ) =(e0

τ

if k = 0,
if k ∈ {1, 2, . . .}.

Note that all points t of the time scale T are right-scattered. Let us choose
If u(t) = u (t, t0, u0) is a solution of

V (t, u(t)) = D∞(cid:16)u(t),e0(cid:17) for all t ∈ T.

(13) corresponding to the initial value u(t0) = u(τ0) = u(0) = u0, then we have

4. A REMARK ON SOME PREVIOUS RESULTS

In [19], Sambandham considers the delta-derivative f ∆ for a function f :
T → X, where X is a Banach space. He investigates the following hybrid fuzzy
system on time scales:

(14)

u∆ = f (t, u, λk(tk, uk)),

t ∈ [tk, tk+1],

u(tk) = uk ∈ S(ρ),

k = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

where S(ρ) = nu ∈ Rn

F : D∞(u,e0) < ρo. Unfortunately, in [19] it is mistakenly

assumed that the space of all fuzzy subsets in Rn, Rn
F , is a Banach space. However,
Rn
F is just a complete metric space and not a Banach space due to the fact that Rn
F
is not a normed space [4]. Here we note that such inconsistency in [19] is easily
overcome. For that we make use of the well-known embedding theorem (see, e.g.,
[4, 5, 18]), to embed the space Rn

F into a Banach space.

Theorem 4.24 (Embedding theorem [18]). There exists a real Banach space X
such that Rn
F can be embedded as a closed convex cone C with vertex 0 in X.
Furthermore, the embedding j is an isometry (i.e., j preserves distance).

Let us denote by k · k the function k u k= D∞(u,e0) deﬁned for u ∈ Rn

F . The
next lemma asserts that k · k has properties similar to the properties of a norm in
the usual crisp sense, without being a norm. It is not a norm because Rn
F is not a
linear space and, consequently, (Rn

F , k · k) is not a normed space.

Lemma 4.25. Function k · k has the following properties:

(i) k u k= 0 if and only if u =e0;

(ii) k λ · u k= |λ|· k u k for all u ∈ Rn

F and λ ∈ R;

(iii) k u ⊕ v k≤k u k + k v k for all u, v ∈ Rn
F .

Proof.

Since (Rn

(ii) For each u ∈ Rn

(i) By deﬁnition of k · k, we have that k u k= 0 if and only if D∞(u,e0) = 0.

F , D∞) is a metric space, u =e0.
k λ · u k= D∞(λ · u,e0) = D∞(λ · u, λ ·e0) = |λ|D∞(u,e0) = |λ| k u k

F and λ ∈ R we have that

because of item (ii) of Proposition 2.10.

(iii) The intended inequality follows from item (iii) of Proposition 2.10:

k u ⊕ v k = D∞(u ⊕ v,e0) = D∞(u ⊕ v,e0 ⊕e0)
≤ D∞(u,e0) + D∞(v,e0) =k u k + k v k .

The proof is complete.

From Lemma 4.25, we deduce that all suﬃcient conditions presented in [19]
hold true in the Banach space X asserted by Theorem 4.24. Indeed, it is enough to
replace Rn
F ) in [19] to conclude with the validity of the suﬃcient conditions
of [19] for the practical stability of the hybrid fuzzy system on time scales (14) in
j(Rn

F ). Because j is invertible, one can then extend the results to Rn
F .

F by j(Rn

5. CONCLUSION

We investigated hybrid fuzzy systems on time scales with two outstanding
purposes: to establish practical stability of hybrid fuzzy systems on time scales
in the Lyapunov sense, based on the delta-Hukuhara derivative; to improve and
state a clariﬁcation of the results of [19]. Furthermore, a comparison theorem
was discussed, which is useful to prove the practical stability criterion. A smart
example of a hybrid fuzzy dynamic system on time scales was also stated and
discussed, illustrating the main results of the paper.
