SPARSE HAMBURGER MOMENT SEQUENCES AND

COMPLETIONS IN SEVERAL VARIABLES

SAROJ ARYAL, HAYOUNG CHOI, AND FARHAD JAFARI*

Dedicated to the memory of James Jamison

Abstract. Putinar and Vasilescu [6] have given an algebraic characterization
of Hamburger moment sequences in several variables. In this paper we give
a characterization of sparse moment subsequences of Hamburger moment se-
quences and consider the problem of completion of these moment subsequences.

1. Introduction.

Let N0 be the set of nonnegative integers and Nn

0 be the set of all multi-indices
α = (α1, α2, . . . , αn), αj ∈ N0 for all j = 1, 2, . . . , n. An n-multisequence (γα)α∈Nn
is said to be positive semi-deﬁnite if

0 and complex-valued n-multisequence (hα)α∈S. We denote

Let Pn be the algebra of all complex-valued polynomials in n-variables and B be

the set of nonnegative Borel measures σ on Rn such that

(2)

|x|αdσ(x) < ∞ for all α ∈ Nn
0 .

ZRn

If L is a complex-valued linear map on Pn such that L(1) > 0 and L(f f ) ≥ 0
(> 0) for every f ∈ Pn, then L is called positive semideﬁnite (deﬁnite). L is said
to be a moment map if there exists a nonnegative Borel measure σ ∈ B such that

L(f ) =Z f dσ for all f ∈ Pn. Generalization of the Hamburger moment problem to

higher dimensions is to ﬁnd necessary and suﬃcient conditions on a multisequence
0 such that if L(xα) = γα, then L is a moment map, i.e. there exists a
(γα)α∈Nn
nonnegative Borel measure σ ∈ B such that

(3)

for all α ∈ Nn
0 ,

γα =ZRn

If we denote the set of moment n-multisequences by Mn, Hamburger’s theorem
states that M1 = M1, see [1] for instance. For n > 1, it is easy to see Mn ⊂ Mn.

and Schm¨udgen [8] independently proved that Mn \ Mn is nonempty. In a seminal
paper, Putinar and Vasilescu [6] provided algebraic conditions for a multisequence
to be a Hamburger moment multisequence. In this paper, we consider the prob-
lem of identifying the subsequences of moment multisequences that are moment
multisequences and consider the completion of these subequences. This work relies
heavily on the techniques developed by Putinar and Vasilescu. We specialize those
results by looking at the subideals of the algebras of rational functions containing
Pn, and study the extension of the positive linear maps from these subalgebras to
the full algebra.

It is useful to state the result from [10] showing the additional required condition
on γ ∈ Mn to guarantee that it belongs to Mn. An equivalent result can be found
in [6].

Theorem 1. An n-multisequence (γα)α∈Nn
positive semideﬁnite 2n-multisequence (δ(α,β))(α,β)∈Nn

such that

0 ∈ Mn if and only if there exists a

(4)

(5)

δα,0 = γα

and

δ(α,β) = δ(α,β+ej ) + δ(α+2ej ,β+ej ),

1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Furthermore, γ is determinate if and only if the corresponding δ is unique.

We shall say that a multisequence (δα,β) ∈ M2n has the P-V property if (4) and
(5) hold. For the sake of notational convenience, some of the results will be stated
just in two dimensional case. Unless stated otherwise, these results can be trivially
extended to higher dimensions.

Given a moment multisequence (γα) ∈ Mn, deﬁne its subsequences (˜γα) as

2. Main Result

(6)
where d = (d1, d2, · · · , dn) ∈ Nn
From the deﬁnition of positivity (Deﬁnition 1), it follows immediately that

0 , ℓ = (ℓ1, ℓ2, · · · , ℓn) ∈ 2Nn

˜γα = γdα+ℓ,

0 , and dα = (d1α1, · · · , dnαn).

Proposition 2. If (γα) ∈ Mn, then (˜γα) ∈ Mn.

Now we are able to state our main result.

Theorem 3. If (γα) ∈ Mn, then the subsequence (˜γα) ∈ Mn.

To prove this theorem, we begin by proving a variation of Vasilescu’s Theorem

[10], viz,

Theorem 4. A multisequence γα ∈ Mn if and only if there exists (δα,β) ∈ M2n
such that

(7)

δα,0 = γα and

(8)

Here dj ∈ Nn

δ(α,β) = δα,β+ej + δα+2dj ej ,β+ej
0 and (ej) are the standard basis vectors in Rn. To prove this
theorem, we will need a few lemmas. Let H be a complex Hilbert space whose
scalar product will be denoted by (∗, ∗). If S is a linear map on H, S deﬁnes a
linear subspace D(S) ⊆ H and has range R(S).

for all 1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Deﬁnition 5. Let T be a symmetric operator in H. Then the Cayley Transform
of T is an operator U deﬁned as

(9)

U = (T − i)(T + i)−1.

Lemma 6. Let U be the Cayley Transform of a symmetric operator T in H. Then
U is unitary if and only if T is self-adjoint.

Proof. See [7, 13.19].

(cid:3)

Lemma 7. Let S be a symmetric densely deﬁned operator in H. If the sets R(S ±i)
are dense in H, then the canonical closure of S is a self-adjoint operator.

Proof. Let A be the canonical closure of S, which is also a symmetric operator.
Since

(10)

k(A ± i)xk2 = kAxk2 + kxk2,

x ∈ D(A),

then R(A± i) are closed subspaces of H. Since R(A± i) ⊇ R(S ± i) and R(S ± i) are
dense in H by hypothesis, we have R(A ± i) = H. Let V be the Cayley transform
of A. Since D(V ) = R(A + i), R(V ) = R(A − i), the operator V is unitary. By
Lemma 6, A must be self-adjoint.
(cid:3)

The following core lemma is a minor variation of Lemma 2.2 in [10].

Lemma 8. Let θj(x) =

, j = 1, . . . , n, x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Rn, d =

1

1 + x2dj

j

(d1, . . . , dn) ∈ Nn
0 . Let Rθ be the algebra of rational functions generated by Pn and
θ = (θ1, . . . , θn). Let ρ : P2n → Rθ deﬁned as ρ : p(x, s) 7→ p(x, θ(x)). Then ρ is a
surjective unital algebra homomorphism, whose kernel is the ideal generated by the

polynomials τj(x, s) = sj(cid:0)1 + x2dj

j

(cid:1) − 1, j = 1, . . . , n, s = (s1, · · · , sn) ∈ Rn.

Proof. The fact that ρ is a surjective unital algebra homomorphism is obvious. To
determine the kernel of ρ, let p ∈ P2n be a polynomial such that p(x, θ(x)) = 0 for
all x ∈ Rn. Then

(11)

p(x, s) = Xβ∈Nn

0

pβ(x)sβ ,

with pβ ∈ Pn\{0} only for a ﬁnite number of indices β. Then we have

p(x, s) = p(x, s) − p(x, θ(x))

pβ(x)(cid:0)sβ − θ(x)β(cid:1)

(sj − θj(x))qj (x, s, θ(x)),

4

where qj are polynomials. Let aj = max
1≤j≤n
as

{βj; pβ 6= 0}, and deﬁne polynomials t(x)

(13)

j (cid:17)aj
t(x) = Y1≤j≤n(cid:16)1 + x2dj

.

Then from equations (12) and (13), we see that

(14)

t(x)p(x, s) = X1≤j≤n

(sj(1 + x2dj

j

) − 1)φj(x, s),

where φj ∈ P2n for all j = 1, · · · n.
If aj = 0 for all j, then p(x, s) = p0(x) =
p(x, θ(x)) = 0. Therefore, without loss of generality, assume that aj 6= 0 for some
j. Notice that the polynomials t, τj have no common zero in C2n. By a special case
of Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz, see [9, Section 16.5] for instance, there are polynomials
˜t, ˜τj ∈ P2n such that

(15)

t˜t + X1≤j≤n

τj ˜τj = 1.

If we multiply (15) by p, and use (14), we obtain

(16)

τj(φj ˜t + ˜τjp).

p = X1≤j≤n

Thus kernel of ρ is the ideal generated by the polynomials τj.

(cid:3)

By the fundamental isomorphism theorem, P2n/kerρ is isomorphic to Rθ. In par-
ticular, there is a one-to-one correspondence between these (commutative) algebras
with units. Now we are ready to prove Theorem 4.

Proof of Theorem 4. Suppose (γα)α∈Nn
a representing measure σ ∈ Bn. Deﬁne

0 is a moment multisequence and hence has

(17)

where

δα,β =ZRn

xαθ(x)β dσ(x), α, β ∈ Nn
0 ,

θj(x) =

1 + x2dj

j

, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, and θ = (θ1, θ2, . . . , θn).

To see that δ is a positive sequence, consider a ﬁnite set S ⊆ Nn
real numbers (hα,β)α,β∈S. Then we have

0 and a sequence of

Xα1,β1,α2,β2∈S

δα1+α2,β1+β2hα1,β1hα2,β2 = Xα1,β1,α2,β2∈SZRn

xα1+α2 θβ1+β2 dσ(x)hα1 ,β1hα2,β2

=ZRn Xα1,β1,α2,β2∈S(cid:2)xα1 θβ1 hα1,β1(cid:3)2

dσ(x),

which is non-negative. Thus δ is positive.

Clearly, δ satisﬁes (7) as

δα,0 =ZRn

xαθ(t)0dσ(x) = γα.

SPARSE HAMBURGER MOMENT SEQUENCES AND COMPLETIONS

Similarly, for all α, β ∈ Nn

0 , j = 1, · · · , n, we have

j

0 =ZRn(cid:16)θj(1 + x2dj
=ZRn(cid:16)θj(x)xαθ(x)β + θj(x)x2dj

) − 1(cid:17) xαθ(x)β dσ(x)

=⇒ δα,β+ej + δα+2dj ej ,β+ej = δα,β,

j xαθ(x)β − xαθ(x)β(cid:17) dσ(x)

which establishes (8).

Conversely, to prove the suﬃciency direction, consider an n-sequence γ and as-
sume that there exists a positive 2n-sequence δ satisfying (4) and (5). Let θj and
θ be as deﬁned in (18). Let Rθ be an algebra generated by Pn and θ. Deﬁne a
positive semi-deﬁnite map Λ on Rθ as

(19)

Λ(r) = Lδ(p), p ∈ P2n, r(x) = p(x, θ(x)) ∈ Rθ,

where Lδ is the linear map associated with δ. Notice that, by Lemma 8, the algebra
Rθ is isomorphic to the quotient P2n/Iτ , where Iτ is the ideal generated in P2n by

the polynomials τj (x, s) = sj(cid:0)1 + x2dj

Lδ|Iτ = 0. Therefore, the map L which can be identiﬁed with the map induced by
Lδ on the quotient P2n/Iτ is well deﬁned on Rθ and is positive semideﬁnite. Now
we use the machinary that was developed by Gelfand and Naimark in their proof
of the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators. Deﬁne a sesquilinear form on Rθ by
the equation

(cid:1) − 1, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. Condition (8) implies

j

(20)

(r1, r2)θ = L(r1r2), r1, r2 ∈ Rθ.

Let N = {r ∈ Rθ : L(rr) = 0}. Then (20) induces a scalar product (∗, ∗) on the
quotient Rθ/N . Let H be the completion of the quotient Rθ/N with respect to
this scalar product. Deﬁne in H the operators

(21)

Tj(r + N ) = xj r + N , r ∈ Rθ, j = 1, . . . , n,

which are symmetric and densely deﬁned, with D(Tj) = Rθ/N for all j. The
operators Tj satisfy the conditions of Lemma 7 for every j. Indeed, if r ∈ Rθ is
arbitrary, then the functions u±(x) = (xj ∓ iθj(x)r(x)) are solutions in Rθ of the
equations (xj ± i)u∓(x) = r(x). This implies that the equalities R(Tj ± i) = D(Tj),
and therefore using Lemma 7, Tj is essentially self-adjoint.

Let Aj be the canonical closure of Tj. Now, we want to show that the operators
(i − A1)−1, · · · , (i − An)−1 mutually commute. Notice that the map (i − Tj)−1 is
well deﬁned on D = D(Tj) and invariant j, by the above argument. Moreover, the
maps (i − T1)−1, · · · , (i − Tn)−1 mutuallly commute on D. Since Aj extends Tj, we
have

(i − Aj)((i − Aj )−1 − (i − Tj)−1)ξ = 0, ξ ∈ D,

implying

Therefore, for all j, k, j 6= k, we have

(i − Aj )−1|D = (i − Tj)−1.

(i − Aj)−1(i − Ak)−1ξ = (i − Tj)−1(i − Tk)−1ξ
= (i − Tk)−1(i − Tj)−1ξ
= (i − Ak)−1(i − Aj)−1ξ, ξ ∈ D.

6

Since (i − A1)−1, · · · , (i − An)−1 are bounded and D is dense, they mutually com-
mute. Therefore, the self-adjoint operators A1, · · · , An have a joint spectral oper-
ator measure E. Then the measure

(22)

σ(∗) = (E(∗)(1 + N ), 1 + N ),

is a representing measure for the functional Λ. In what follows, we will show σ is
a representing measure for the given sequence γ.

Let r(T ) be the linear map on D given by

r(T )(f + N ) = rf + N , r, f ∈ Rθ.

then we have θ(A)β ⊃ θ(T )β, where θ(A)β is given by the functional calculus of A.
This follows from the relations θ(A)−β ⊃ θ(T )−β and θ(A)−β (θ(A)β − θ(T )β) = 0.
Therefore,

δα,β = (xαθ(x)β 1, 1)θ

= (tαθ(T )β(1 + N ), 1 + N )
= (Aαθ(A)β (1 + N ), 1 + N )

Hence, using the condition (4) and equation (22), we have

xαθ(x)β d(E(x)(1 + N ), 1 + N ).

Proof of Theorem 3. Suppose ˜γα = γdα+ℓ where d = (d1, · · · , dj) ∈ Nn
2Nn
(7) and (8) in Theorem 4. Deﬁne another multisequence ˜δ as

(23)
It can be easily veriﬁed that ˜δ ∈ M2n and satisﬁes (4). Applying the condition of
equation (8) to δdα+ℓ,β we have for every j = 1, · · · , n,

˜δα,β = δdα+ℓ,β.

δdα+ℓ,β = δdα+ℓ,β+ej + δdα+ℓ+2dej ,β+ej ,

which can be re-written as

δdα+ℓ,β = δdα+ℓ,β+ej + δd(α+2ej )+ℓ,β+ej ,

implying

(24)
which is just equation (5) for ˜δ. Therefore, by Theorem 1, we conclude that ˜γ ∈
Mn.
(cid:3)

˜δα,β = ˜δα,β+ej + ˜δα+2ej ,β+ej ,

As a concluding remark to this section, we provide below another suﬃcient

condition for the subsequence ˜γ to be a moment sequence.

Theorem 9. A subsequence ˜γ as deﬁned in (6) of a moment multisequence (γα)α∈Nn
having a representing measure σ is a moment multisequence if

where θ = (θ1, · · · , θn) and θj =

Proof. By Theorem 1, there exists a positive semideﬁnite 2n-multisequence (δα,β)
with the P-V property that extends (γα), where δ is deﬁned as

(26)

Now, deﬁne a 2n-multisequence ˜δ as

δα,β =ZRn

xαθβdσ(x).

(27)
Clearly, ˜δ is positive by Theorem 2. It is suﬃcient to show that ˜δ satisﬁes the P-V
property, namely equations (4) and (5) hold. Since

˜δα,β = δdα+ℓ,β, α, β ∈ Nn
0 .

(28)

˜γα = γdα = δdα,0 = ˜δα,0,

then condition (4) is satisﬁed. To prove condition (5), we have,

˜δα,β = δdα+ℓ,β

= δdα+ℓ,β+ej + δdα+ℓ+2ej ,β+ej

=ZR2 xdα+ℓθβ+ej + xdα+ℓ+2ej θβ+ej + xdα+ℓθβ x2dj

Therefore, ˜δ satisﬁes the P-V property and ˜γ ∈ Mn.

(cid:3)

Corollary 10. If (γα)α∈Nn

0 ∈ Mn, then (˜γα) deﬁned as ˜γα = γα+ℓ is in Mn.

Proof. Notice that the condition (25) in Theorem 9 is satisﬁed when dj = 1 for all
j ∈ N0.
(cid:3)

The subsequence identiﬁed in Corollary 10 is particularly useful in the case when

a block of data is missing.

3. Completions

j

Given a positive map ˜Λ on the subalgebra ˜Rθ determined by the ideal generated
by the polynomials τj(x, s) = sj(1 + x2dj
) − 1, j = 1, · · · , n, one may ask if this
map ˜Λ extends to a positive map Λ on the larger algebra, Rθ determined by the
ideal generated by ηj(x, s) = sj(1 + x2
j ) − 1, j = 1, · · · , n. If so, by Corollary 2.6
in [6], there is a uniquely determined representing measure ˜µ in Rn for ˜Λ such that
the algebra ˜Rθ is dense in L2(˜µ). Since, without loss of generality, we may assume
˜Λ(e) = 1 for the unit e in ˜Rθ, by the Hahn-Banach theorem for positive functionals,
the positive functional ˜Λ extends to a positive functional Λ on Rθ. Hence, again

applying Corollary 2.6 in [6], there exists a µ on Rn such that Λ(f ) = Z f dµ for

every f ∈ Rθ, Rθ is dense in L2(µ), and Λ agrees with ˜Λ on the smaller algebra.
In particular, the partial sequence is completable. In general, since the extension
of ˜Λ to Λ is not unique, this extension will not be unique. Thus, we have

8

SAROJ ARYAL, HAYOUNG CHOI, AND FARHAD JAFARI*

Theorem 11. Every subsequence ( ˜γα) ∈ Mn is completable to a moment sequence
γα ∈ Mn.

4. Counterexamples to the Converse of the Main Result

The above shows that if (γα) ∈ Mn is arbitrary, then its subsequences (˜γα) ∈
Mn. However, for speciﬁc sequences γα, or even for those with various growth
properties, the below examples show that no reasonable characterization of moment
subsequences is possible.

Example 1. We state below one of the main results from [4] without proof.

Theorem 12. Let (sk)k∈N0 be a sequence of positive numbers satisfying

sk+1sk−1 ≥ c0s2
k,

(29)
where c0 is the unique real root of x3 − 5x2 + 4x − 1 approximately equal to 4.0796.
Then, for each positive integer n, the Hankel matrices H = {si+j−2}1≤i,j≤n and
H1 = {si+j−1}1≤i,j≤n are strictly totally positive. Moreover, there is a nondecreas-
ing function σ with inﬁnitely points of increase such that

(30)

sn =Z ∞

0

xndσ(x)

for all n ∈ N0.

Note that the integral representation (30) says that sk is a Stieltjes moment
sequence. However, the positivity of the Hankel matrix H = {si+j−2}1≤i,j≤n makes
it a Hamburger moment sequence as well. Indeed, any nondecreasing measure in
[0, ∞) can be trivially extended to a nondecreasing measure in R.

Consider a subsequence (sk) that satisﬁes the condition (29) and hence is a
Hamburger moment sequence using Theorem 12. Let (tk) be its subsequence such
that t0 = s0, t1 = s1 and tk = sk+1 for all k ≥ 2. Notice that (tk) is not in an
arithmetic pattern of (sk). But since

tk+1 = sk+2 ≥ c0

s2
k+1
sk

(tk) is a Hamburger moment sequence using Theorem 12.

Example 2. The Hilbert sequence given as sk =

the sequence tk =(cid:18) 1

of (sk) and hence is a moment sequence, see [5]. But (tk) is not in an arithmetic
pattern of (sk).

Of course, there is a deeper question in the background here. If P ⊂ Nn

0 is a
pattern, in Section 2 it is shown that if γα is a moment multisequence, and P is a
multidimensional arithmetic progression, then (γα)α∈P is a moment multisequence.
The converse of this theorem, would ask if γα is any (arbitrary) moment sequence
and (γα)α∈P is a moment multisequence, is P necessarily an arithmetic progression?
The fact that this is false even for n = 1 was shown in [3].
