We study properties of the single-site reduced density matrix in the Bose-Bose resonance model
as a function of system parameters. This model describes a single-component Bose gas with a
resonant coupling to a diatomic molecular state, here deﬁned on a lattice. A main goal is to
demonstrate that the eigenstates of the single-site reduced density matrix have structures that are
characteristic for the various quantum phases of this system. Since the Hamiltonian conserves
only the global particle number but not the number of bosons and molecules individually, these
eigenstates, referred to as optimal modes, can be nontrivial linear combinations of bare eigenstates
of the molecular and boson particle number. We numerically analyze the optimal modes and their
weights, the latter giving the importance of the corresponding state, in the ground state of the Bose-
Bose resonance model. We ﬁnd that the single-site von Neumann entropy is sensitive to the location
of the phase boundaries. We explain the structure of the optimal modes and their weight spectra
using perturbation theory and via a comparison to results for the single-component Bose-Hubbard
model. We further study the dynamical evolution of the optimal modes and of the single-site
entanglement entropy in two quantum quenches that cross phase boundaries of the model and show
that these quantities are thermal in the steady state. For our numerical calculations, we use the
density matrix renormalization group method for ground-state calculations and time evolution in a
Krylov subspace for the quench dynamics as well as exact diagonalization.

INTRODUCTION

Studying entanglement measures in the vicinity of
quantum phase transitions of many-body Hamiltonians
has become a very active ﬁeld and is quite a useful tool.
For the characterization of quantum phases the ﬁnite-
size scaling properties of entanglement entropies such as
the von Neumann entropy have turned out to be very
informative, providing information about gapped phases
through area laws and the number of gapless modes via
the central charge for gapless systems with a confor-
mally invariant low-energy theory [1, 2]. Moreover, ad-
ditional information can be extracted from the entangle-
ment spectrum (see, e.g., [3–9]).

Numerical work has suggested that the single-site en-
tanglement entropy can be sensitive to quantum phase
transitions in interacting fermionic systems in one dimen-
sion such as the extended Hubbard model [10]. This has
further been explored and applied to spin systems [11]
as well as to the Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) [12]. The
single-site entanglement entropy S(1)
vN is directly linked to
the eigenvalues wα of the single-site reduced density ma-
trix ρ(1) obtained by tracing out the degrees of freedom
of all sites but one (deﬁning the environment E) from
the ground-state wave function:
ρ(1) = trE(|ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ|) =

wα|α(cid:105)(cid:104)α|

(cid:88)

vN = −(cid:88)

S(1)

wα ln(wα).

(2)

α

Here, |α(cid:105) are the eigenstates of ρ(1) and the wα are their
weights. Since the individual particle numbers for spin up
and down are conserved in the Hubbard model and since

ing into account also normalization(cid:80)

the local Hilbert space is only two- or four-dimensional
for spin-1/2 and Hubbard models, respectively, one can
easily see that there are very few free parameters, tak-
α wα = 1. There-
fore, for a spin-1/2 system with spin-inversion symmetry,
S(1)
vN = ln(2), independent of system size and the actual
model. For the Fermi-Hubbard model at half ﬁlling and
vanishing magnetization, there is only one free parameter
[10].

We will be interested in systems with large local
bosonic Hilbert spaces, where some crucial diﬀerences
arise. First, the local Hilbert space is much larger and
second, in models that do not preserve particle number,
the eigenstates |α(cid:105) of ρ(1) do not need to be eigenstates of
the local particle number (plus possible additional U (1)
symmetries). This is most notably the case for systems
with phononic degrees of freedom such as the Holstein
model [13]. Originally intended as a means to improve
numerical methods, Zhang, Jeckelmann and White [14]
introduced the term optimal modes for the eigenstates of
the single-site reduced density matrix. Their idea was to
set up algorithms in an eﬀective Hilbert space obtained
by truncating in the spectrum of the single-site reduced
density matrix. This gives a computational advantage
whenever the weight spectrum decays suﬃciently fast.
This concept has been used in exact diagonalization stud-
ies [15–17] and density matrix renormalization group al-
gorithms [18–22] but also bears useful information about
the equilibrium [14] and non-equilibrium physics [23] of
such systems. In general, for systems with bosonic de-
grees of freedom, ρ(1) and hence also the single-site en-
tanglement entropy can therefore harbor much more in-
formation than in fermionic or spin systems.

In our work we consider a bosonic model with a global

served. This system thus possesses non-trivial optimal
modes, which, as a function of model parameters, can un-
dergo a mixing of the contributions coming from the bare
eigenstates of both particle numbers, which one typically
uses to set up a convenient basis for numerical methods.
Concretely, we study the so-called one-dimensional
(1D) Bose-Bose-resonance model (BBRM) [24–30] that
describes a Bose gas with repulsive contact interactions
plus resonant interactions, here deﬁned on a lattice (for
a study in two and three dimensions we refer to [31]).
The resonant interaction mimics the physics of a Fesh-
bach resonance [32, 33]: When two atoms meet on the
same site, they can form a molecule. The Hamiltonian
reads:

consists of ﬁve parts: A Bose-Hubbard term HBH,s for

tuning term HD. The Feshbach-coupling term describes
the conversion of two atoms into a molecule and vice
versa. Because of this conversion the Hamiltonian con-
serves only the total number of particles NT = Na + 2Nm

Our main goal is to elucidate the behavior of the single-
site entanglement entropy and the structure of optimal
modes in the quantum phases of this model and, in par-
ticular, in the vicinity of the phase transitions. Moreover,
we consider quantum quenches between diﬀerent phases
and investigate the changes in the optimal modes in non-
equilibrium dynamics.

Throughout this work, we focus on the following set of
parameters, for which the phase diagram of the model is
known from Ref. [29]: tm = ta/2, Ua/2 = Um/2 = Uam =
g = U . Moreover, we work at ﬁxed ﬁlling NT/L = 2,
where L is the number of sites and we set ta = 1. The
phase diagram is schematically shown in Fig. 1. There
are three phases [29]: a Mott-insulator (MI), a molecular
condensate (MC) and a phase in which both atoms and
molecules quasi-condense (AC+MC). Note that by using
the term condensate we follow the terminology of [29], yet

the three phases: molecular condensate (MC), molecular and

horizontal and vertical dashed lines mark the two trajectories
through the phase diagram along which we compute entan-
glement properties and optimal modes, both in equilibrium
and in quantum quenches.

of course, in one dimension, there can only be quasi-long
range order.

Our main results are: First, we ﬁnd that the ﬁrst
derivative of the local von Neumann entropy with respect
to the detuning displays a maximum at the position of the
phase boundary between the MC and AC+MC phases.
Furthermore, we observe that the single-site entangle-
ment entropy is a monotonically increasing (decreasing)
function of system size in the MI (MC) phase. We pro-
vide qualitative arguments for this behavior and contrast
it to the Mott-insulator-to-superﬂuid transition in the
Bose-Hubbard model. This change in the system-size
dependence leads to features in the vicinity of the phase
transition as our numerical data suggest. Next, we study
the weights and optimal-mode spectra as a function of
model parameters and explain their behavior in the three
phases indicated by the points in Fig. 1 by using density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) [34, 35] simula-
tions of the BBRM, perturbation theory and a compari-
son to numerical results for the Bose-Hubbard model.

While our main goal

is the investigation of entan-
glement properties and of optimal-mode structures, our
work is also one of the ﬁrst numerical studies of quantum
quenches in interacting Bose gases with resonant interac-
tions. This is relevant to ultra-cold quantum gas physics
[32] where such quenches play an important role and were
studied experimentally in Bose gases (see, e.g., [36, 37]).
Recent experiments have investigated quenches in Bose
gases to unitarity [38]. Here, however, we do not aim at
making contact with any experiment with a Feshbach res-
onance. For recent studies of non-equilibrium properties
in fermionic and bosonic systems coupled to bound states
via Feshbach interactions, see [39–44]. We here report
results for two quantum quenches where we start from a
point deep in the MI (MC) phase and quench the sys-

tem over to the MC (AC+MC) phase (Fig. 1). The pre-
and postquench parameters are chosen such that they
correspond to the cases studied in the ground-state sec-
tion, i.e., those indicated in Fig. 1, deep in the respective
phases. In addition to the local von Neumann entropy
and the structure of the optimal modes (Sec. IV B), we
discuss the time evolution of the momentum distribution
function for both, molecules and atoms. Because of the
large bosonic Hilbert space and ﬂuctuations, the ques-
tion of thermalization is already interesting for a single-
site object. We ﬁnd that the single-site reduced density
matrix is thermal in the steady state by comparison to
the corresponding expectation values in the canonical en-
semble.

The plan of the paper is the following. We start by
deﬁning the computational basis, the relevant observ-
ables and numerical methods in Sec. II. In Sec. III, we
study the ground-state properties of our system. More
speciﬁcally, the number of molecules and the single-site
von Neumann entropy (Sec. III A) as well as the weight
spectrum and structure of the optimal modes (Sec. III B)
are studied as a function of detuning and inverse inter-
action strength along two diﬀerent trajectories through
the phase diagram. Section IV illustrates the behavior of
the BBRM system under a global quench from the MI to
the MC phase and from the MC to the AC+MC phase.
We conclude in Sec. V with a summary of our results.

NUMERICAL METHODS

For the BBRM we measure the atomic and molecular
particle numbers, the momentum distribution function,
the optimal-mode weights and spectra (the optimal mode
expressed in the bare occupation number basis) as well as
the single-site entanglement entropy for the ground state
and during quenches between diﬀerent phases.

B. Computational basis

To numerically simulate the BBRM model we need a
two-component basis consisting of both an atomic and
molecular part. As already stated, because of the Fesh-
bach term in Eq. (3) they do not completely decouple
and only the total particle number NT is conserved. As
a consequence, the basis splits into blocks of tensorprod-
ucts between atomic and molecular subbasis sets with a
ﬁxed number of particles N (1)

D. Numerical methods

We use two wave-function based numerical methods:
exact diagonalization (ED) and the density matrix renor-
malization group (DMRG) method. DMRG is a matrix-
product states based algorithm [2, 34, 35]. To treat the
rather large local state-space dimension eﬃciently we em-
ploy the so called single-site DMRG with subspace ex-
pansion [45]. This particular method has the advantage
that it scales with O(d2) instead of O(d3) as the well-
known two-site DMRG where d denotes the size of the
local Hilbert space. To keep the size of the Hilbert space
manageable we conserve the number of particles NT dur-
ing the simulation.

The ED method is used to get numerically exact data
for small systems. Time evolution is performed in the
Krylov space with the time step chosen small enough to
be accurate keeping 20 Krylov states. As mentioned ear-
lier, since both atoms and molecules are bosons the local
dimension d is very large. To deal with this we exploit
particle number conservation, translation symmetry and
reﬂection symmetry on a lattice with periodic boundary
conditions.

III. GROUND-STATE PROPERTIES

Here, we present our results for properties of the single-
site entanglement entropy and of the optimal modes in
the three phases, the molecular condensate (MC), atomic
and molecular condensate (AC+MC) and the Mott insu-
lating (MI) phase.

A. Single-site von Neumann entropy and molecular

density

In this section we study the number of molecules and
the von Neumann entropy as a function of detuning m
and interaction strength U . For this purpose we choose
two trajectories through the phase diagram as indicated
by the arrows in Fig. 1.

FIG. 2. (Color online) (a) Density of molecules and (b) single-
site von Neumann entropy for the ground state along the tra-
jectory between the MC (m = −6ta, ta/U = 3) and AC+MC
(m = 2ta, ta/U = 3) phases. The horizontal dashed lines
show the values for the local entanglement entropy calculated
for a Bose-Hubbard model at unit ﬁlling and U/ta = 20 in the
MC limit and double ﬁlling and U/ta = 10 in the AC+MC
limit. (c) First derivative of S(1)
vN with respect to m. The ver-
tical dashed line marks the position c
m of the phase transition
taken from [29]. The data are calculated using DMRG with
a local cutoﬀ N (1)

T = 30 and a bond dimension D = 200.

1. MC to AC+MC phase

The ﬁrst contour connects the MC to the AC+MC
phases by varying m only. The results for this case are
presented in Fig. 2. Figure 2(a) shows the density of
molecules as a function of the detuning. For m = −6ta,
there are practically only molecules present in the system.
This is expected because for a ﬁxed interaction U/ta the
detuning regulates which one of the two species, atoms
or molecules, are favored in the ground state, and thus

.

For m = 2ta, the number of molecules is small since

Figure 2(b) illustrates the dependence of the single-
site von Neumann entropy on the detuning. For large
positive and negative m, S(1)
vN saturates at ﬁnite values,
while there is a maximum slightly to the right of the
phase boundary between the MC and the AC+MC phase
(indicated by the dashed line).
vN (m → −∞) be-
tween the values for m (cid:28) −ta and m (cid:29) ta can be
estimated from calculating the von Neumann entropy of

This results in

where the diﬀerence arises from the diﬀerent ﬁlling fac-
tors in these limits (namely the corresponding particle
numbers are N = Nm = L and N = Na = 2L, respec-
tively). Those two limiting values overestimate the actual
numerical values due to the non-zero repulsive interac-
tions Ua/2 = Um/2 = U > 0 that lead to a condensate
depletion. We compare the data in Fig. 2(b) to the nu-
merical value for a Bose-Hubbard model on a lattice with
L = 64 sites and the corresponding interaction strength:
N = 128, t = 1, U/2 = t/3 for the AC+MC phase and
N = 64, t = 0.5, U/2 = t/3 for the MC phase (plotted in
Fig. 2(b) as dashed lines). The results for the BHM agree
very well with the data for the BBRM in the appropriate
limits.

vN (m) close to the transition at c

The most striking feature is the system-size depen-
dence of S(1)
m (vertical
dashed line in Fig. 2). This translates into a pronounced
maximum in the derivative of S(1)
vN (m) with respect to
m in the vicinity of c
m, which is plotted in Fig. 2(c).
With increasing system size L the maximum value grows
and an extrapolation to large system sizes via 1/L → 0
leads to a ﬁnite value for the maximal value in an inﬁnite
system. This suggests that S(1)
vN (m) is sensitive to this
phase transition.

The behavior of S(1)
vN and of its derivative in the vicinity
m can be understood in the limit of U/ta → 0. In this
of c
case (note that g = U ), the system is described by the
Hamiltonian

Thus, the ground state is either a condensate of atoms
or of molecules depending on the value of m. Since

happens abruptly at a critical detuning ˜m = −3ta for
tm = ta/2, where the system goes from NT = Na = 2L
to NT = 2Nm = 2L. This leads to a sudden jump in
the local von Neumann entropy and therefore, a singu-
larity in its derivative with respect to the detuning at
˜m. The eﬀect of ﬁnite interactions is to smoothen this
jump, which leads to a ﬁnite value for the maximum of
the derivative and also a shift of the critical point to a
smaller value than ˜m = −3ta.

2. MI to MC phase

Figure 3 shows the density of molecules and the von
Neumann entropy for the second trajectory which con-
nects the MC and MI phases (compare Fig. 1). Along
this line, m = const while ta/U is varied. The density
of molecules nm is a monotonically increasing function of
ta/U [see Fig. 3(a)]. The value of nm, in the limiting case
of ta/U (cid:29) 1, is nm = 1, the maximum possible one for
the chosen ﬁlling of NT/L = 2.

also be understood in the limit of weak interactions
ta/U → ∞ (in this limit, g = 0 as well). As dis-
cussed above there is a critical ˜m for which one obtains
either molecules (m < ˜m) or atoms (m > ˜m) only,
with ˜m = −3ta. For the parameters of Fig. 3, we have
m = −6ta and hence mostly molecules for ta/U (cid:29) 1.

A nonzero g can only couple the states in the N (1)

Using this state, we can calculate the molecular density
in this limit, ﬁnding nm(U/ta (cid:29) 1) ≈ 0.789, which is in
perfect agreement with the numerical results shown in
Fig. 3(a) when extrapolated to ta/U = 0.

Figure 3(b) shows the single-site von Neumann entropy
as a function of ta/U .
In the limit of U/ta = 0, the
system is in a (non-interacting) molecular condensate.
Hence, the von Neumann entropy approaches the value
S(1)
vN = 1.27 [see Eq. (13)] with decreasing U/ta [indicated
by the horizontal dotted line in Fig. 3(b)]. In the opposite
limit, the Hamiltonian is fully local and the entanglement
entropy thus vanishes. In between these limits, S(1)
vN is a
monotonically increasing function of ta/U .

vN at the phase transition. S(1)

Contrary to Fig. 2(b) there is no directly obvious fea-
ture in S(1)
vN exhibits a max-
imum in its ﬁrst derivative which, however, converges to
a point far below (U/ta)c = 1.176 as L increases and
this maximum is therefore not connected to the phase
transition between the superﬂuid and the MI phase. In
fact, previous studies [12, 47] of the Bose-Hubbard model
at unit ﬁlling found a similar behavior of the single-site
entanglement entropy.

However, comparing the curves for diﬀerent system
sizes, we ﬁnd that S(1)
vN is a monotonically increas-
ing(decreasing) function of L in the MI(MC) phase (see
the arrows in Fig. 3(b)). The qualitative behavior in the
MI phase can be explained as a consequence of the ﬁnite
(exponentially decaying) correlation length [48]. Because

6

of that, the local entropy has to increase with system size
until it saturates at a ﬁnite value when the system is large
enough to support the full correlation length. This be-
havior can be veriﬁed numerically for a point deep in the
MI phase for both BBRM and BHM.

The behavior in the MC phase can be obtained by
calculating the ﬁrst derivative of the local von Neumann
entropy Eq. (10) with respect to system size L explicitly
in leading order in 1/L in a non-interacting condensate.
In order to be able to do this analytically we use an

upper bound for the binomial coeﬃcient (cid:0)n

(cid:1) ≤ nk/k!

(for details, see the Appendix A). We ﬁnd, to leading
order, S(1)
vN = a + b/L, where a, b are constants. Again,
choosing a point deep in the MC phase this behavior can
be veriﬁed both for the BBRM and BHM.

k

This suggests to study the L-dependence of the diﬀer-

ence between two curves for system sizes L and 2L

δSL(U ) = S(1)

vN,L(U ) − S(1)

vN,2L(U ).

(19)

This choice ensures that the ratio between system sizes
is kept constant. Interestingly, the diﬀerence in local en-
tanglement entropy is a linear function of ta/U in the
vicinity of the phase transition (see Fig. 2(c)). The point
where the curves cross zero are the points where the
monotony of the local entropy changes as a function of
L. This corresponds to the observation that the local
entropy increases in the MI phase, while it decreases in
the MC phase. With increasing system size two eﬀects
occur. The slope decreases and the point where the curve
hits zero shifts to the left, in the direction of the phase
boundary (indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 2(c) [29]).
A naive extrapolation to 1/L = 0, however, yields an
estimate for the critical point that is below the litera-
ture value. We also study the BHM at unit ﬁlling which
corresponds to the m → −∞ limit of the BBRM for our
choice of parameters. In this case, the local von Neumann
entropy (and δSL(U ) as deﬁned in Eq. (19)) behaves in
exactly the same way as in the BBRM, as expected.

B. Structure of optimal modes

In this section we study the structure of optimal modes
(deﬁned in Sec. II A) for speciﬁc points in each one of the
three phases and then we investigate the changes in these
states as the phase boundaries are crossed.

1. MI phase

We start with the MI phase, considering the param-

U = 0.1, m = −6ta. We ﬁrst take a look at the
eters ta
weight spectrum wα shown in Fig. 4(a). The spectrum is
dominated by the ﬁrst optimal mode with w0 (cid:46) 1. Then
there are sequences of plateaus of several states each with
very similar weights. In the ﬁrst of these plateaus, there
are two pairs of states that are very close to each other.

ticle number subsector the states with label n are located.

T = 2 subspace to a state in the N (1)

U/ta limit. The plateau structure in Fig. 4(a) emerges in
ﬁrst-order perturbation theory. Qualitatively, the struc-
ture of the weight spectrum and the optimal-mode spec-
tra can be understood from the following observation. In
ﬁrst order the atomic hopping term couples the optimal
mode in the ta/U = 0 limit (see Eq. (18)) which resides
in the N (1)
T = 1
subspace and a state in the N (1)
T = 3 subspace. By
contrast, the molecular hopping term couples this state
to a state in the N (1)
T = 0 subspace and a state in the
N (1)
T = 4 subspace. Because of that there are two pairs
of degenerate optimal modes. This perfectly describes
the relative positions of the optimal-mode spectra of the
modes α = 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Fig. 5(a). Following this rea-
soning we can also qualitatively explain the second and
third plateaus in the spectrum. In second order the sys-
tem couples to the states in the N (1)
T = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
subspaces. Since the N (1)
T = 0, 1 subspaces are non-
degenerate and contain only one state, they do not con-
tribute to the second plateau. By comparison to the
numerics we ﬁnd that the second plateau corresponds
to exactly the remaining ﬁve states originating from the
N (1)
T = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 subspaces. The same argument holds
also for the third plateau present in Fig. 4(a).

The optimal-mode spectra are shown in Fig. 5(a).
First, we see that the optimal modes are very simple su-
perpositions of the bare modes. They are constrained in
form because, as discussed above, they can only mix bare
states with the same total particle number N (1)
T . There-
fore, the more interesting modes are the ones that mix
bare modes, e.g., α = 0, 1, 4, 5 where the relative contri-
butions of the bare modes in the large U/ta limit depend
on the parameters m and g (the latter being tied to U
in our study).

More information can be obtained from perturbation
theory in the hopping parameter ta (remember that in
our case, tm = ta/2). From the previous discussion
(Sec. III A), we know that in the ta/U = 0 limit the
ground state is a product state of the local state given in
Eq. (18). Therefore, for exactly ta/U = 0

is that there are more than just one species present in
both states, plus eﬀects of the Feshbach term.

Figure 5(b) shows the optimal-mode spectra for a point
in the MC phase. The individual optimal modes in
this phase are the bare occupation number states, with
virtually no mixing in the degenerate subspaces (e.g.,
NT = 2). The ﬁrst noticeable deviation between the pre-
diction for the optimal-mode structure from considering
a BHM compared to the numerical data occurs for the
α = 4 optimal mode: this mode consists of a molecule
and an atom, showing that the presence of atoms is still
important for this state. The simple structure of the opti-
mal modes in the MC phase roots in the fact that adding
an atom is suppressed for this choice of m.

In the AC+MC phase we observe a very similar behav-
ior: the ﬁrst two modes are perfectly peaked. The other
ones are already mixtures of atoms and molecules which
shows that one can not neglect one of those species in
this phase.

C. Evolution of optimal modes across phase

transitions

In this section we discuss the optimal-mode structure
when tuning the system continuously crossing one of two
phase boundaries, i.e., either the MC to AC+MC transi-
tion or the MI to MC transition.

2. MC and AC+MC phase

Next, we consider the weight spectrum and optimal
modes for the MC and AC+MC phases which are illus-
trated in Figs. 4(b),(c) and 5(b),(c) respectively. The
weights for the MC and AC+MC phases [Figs. 4(b) and
(c)] are compared to those computed for a Bose-Hubbard
model at unit (MC) and double ﬁlling (AC+MC). In the
MC phase we compare to a BHM with NT = L parti-
cles because for our choice of parameters, the number of
atoms is negligible (see Fig. 2(a)). In the AC+MC phase
we compare to a BHM with NT = 2L particles since in
this phase very few molecules are present (again consult
Fig. 2(a)) and thus, all the particles are unbound. The
weights are computed using DMRG for a system of size
L = 64.
These estimates provide a very good approximation of
the exact values until they begin to deviate at wα ≈ 10−4
where the weights start to decay slower in the BBRM
compared to the (single-component) BHM. The reason

The MC to AC+MC transition

As discussed before, the local entanglement entropy is
sensitive to the location of this transition (Sec. III A).
It is very curious to ask how the optimal-mode struc-
ture changes as a function of detuning m. Figures 6(a)
- 6(h) show the projection of the most important eight
optimal modes on the n-th bare mode as a function of
detuning m. Generally, all eight states seem to change
signiﬁcantly in the vicinity of the phase boundary. This
is expected by inspection of Fig. 5: the optimal-mode
structures at the two points deep in the phases are dif-
ferent and at some point, a reorganization has to occur.
Also, we see that this transition manifests itself in one of
two ways:

(i) A continuous transition. When the two modes are
located in the same block (i.e., they can be labeled with
the same total number of particles N (1)
T ) the transition
is smooth (excluding the case of U = 0). An example
for this behavior is given in Fig. 6(a): We see in Fig. 5
that the most important optimal mode in the MC phase
is in the N (1)
T = 2 block where the two atoms are bound
inside a molecule. The corresponding optimal mode in
the AC+MC phase lies in the same block but is a state
where the two particles are unbound.

(ii) A level crossing. When two modes are located
in diﬀerent blocks a sudden jump can occur when the
weights cross each other. An example for this behavior
is shown in Fig. 6(b): In this case the modes can not
smoothly transform into each other and the structures
stay roughly the same until their weights suddenly swap
position and, therefore, one mode becomes more impor-
tant than the other one. Since the weights are a smooth
function of the detuning (at least for our system size) this
means that a mode that has a low weight in the initial
state and a high one in the ﬁnal state has to climb until
it reaches its ﬁnal position. Examples for this behavior
are shown in Figs. 6(b),(c) and (d): The N (1)
T = 1 state
has a low weight in the MC phase and thus has to ascend
the ladder of optimal states until it reaches its ﬁnal posi-
tion as the second-most important mode in the AC+MC
phase state. Its ascent can ﬁrst be seen in Fig. 6(d) where
this state ﬁrst gains appreciable weight while upon fur-
ther increasing m, it moves to Fig. 6(c) where it stays
only shortly until it reaches its ﬁnal position in Fig. 6(b)
for all larger values of the detuning.

So far, we have discussed how two diﬀerent modes can
transform directly into another. We want to get some
insight into what happens to the optimal modes when
crossing the phase boundary. Figure 6(a) shows how the
α = 0 mode evolves during the transition: for small de-
tuning the majority of the weight is in the |n = 3(cid:105) = |0, 1(cid:105)
state. As the detuning increases the weight gets shifted
over to the |n = 2(cid:105) = |2, 0(cid:105) state. Thereby, without
having any other information we can conclude that the
system favors molecules in one phase and atoms in the
other. The same happens in all other modes where the

9

optimal modes mix more than one state. An interest-
ing feature emerges in the higher optimal modes α = 5, 6
(Figs. 6(f),(g)): the corresponding optimal modes change
their structure abruptly by jumping from (linear combi-
nations of) small to large n states. The occurrence of this
jump is independent of system size and sits right at the
phase boundary. We note that most rearrangements in
the optimal modes, independent of their nature, happen
in the vicinity of the phase boundary (indicated by the
dashed lines in the ﬁgures) and thereby the changes in
the optimal modes are correlated to this transition.

2. The MI to MC transition

The second transition that we study is the one from
the MI to the MC phase by varying the interaction U
only. The corresponding results are shown in Figs. 7(a)
- 7(d). By inspecting Fig. 5, we see that apart from the
ﬁrst optimal mode no pair of them is located in the same
block and thus they all have to undergo a level cross-
ing. The change in the second and third mode shown
in Figs. 7(b),(c) occurs at a value close to ta/U = 0.1.
Again, the α = 0 mode lies in the N (1)
T = 2 subspace
for the whole range of observed values of ta/U . With in-
creasing ta/U the atomic contribution to this mode gets
suppressed because the detuning term dominates the oc-
cupation ratio. Another feature in the vicinity of the
phase transition is shown in Fig. 7(d): a jump occurs
where the N (1)
T = 3 mode drops to an even lower weight
and the N (1)
T = 6 mode moves to its ﬁnal relative po-
sition. Again, the optimal modes show features in the
vicinity of the phase boundary which suggest that they
are sensitive to this transition as well.

IV. QUANTUM QUENCHES

In the last section we calculated observables in the
ground state along two trajectories in the phase dia-
gram where both crossed a phase boundary (see Fig. 1).
This procedure can be seen as evolving the system in
time from one point in the phase diagram to another one
adiabatically. In this section we change parameters in-
stantaneously between the points marked in Fig. 1 via a
quantum quench.

A. Number of molecules and single-site von

Neumann entropy

For the quenches,

in addition to the real-space ob-
servables nm and S(1)
vN , we also study the k = 0 com-
ponent of the quasimomentum distribution function of
atoms (molecules) rescaled by the total number of atoms
(molecules). Also, we calculate the long-time limit of
the expectation value of the molecular density which is

where |ψn(cid:105) are the eigenstates of the postquench Hamil-

Additionally, we compare the expectation value of the
molecular particle number density in the diagonal en-
semble with the one in the canonical ensemble and of the
local von Neumann entropy in the steady state with the
one in the canonical ensemble. For the calculation of ex-
pectation values in the diagonal and canonical ensembles
we use a system of size L = 6 due to the need of a full
diagonalization of the Hamiltonians.

where H is the postquench Hamiltonian. The quench
energy in this quench is ﬁnite and so large that the ini-
tial state samples primarily eigenstates in the bulk of
the spectrum and it is therefore not surprising that the
observables are not comparable to their ground-state ex-
pectation values.

We also calculate the diagonal and canonical ensem-
ble average for the molecular density in a system of size
L = 6 (diagonal ensemble: dotted line in Fig. 8(c)) [50].
For the calculation of the canonical expectation value we
ﬁrst extract the canonical temperature T by ﬁxing the
expectation value of the energy in the canonical ensem-
ble to the energy of the initial state with respect to the
postquench Hamiltonian

In the ﬁrst few time steps the k = 0

the diagonal ensemble average with a relative diﬀerence

of (ndiag
diﬀerence can be attributed to ﬁnite-size eﬀects [50]. As
expected, the local von Neumann entropy increases in
time up to a point where the system reaches a steady
state. Increasing system size has two eﬀects: ﬁrst, the
atomic zero-quasimomentum occupation decreases and,
second, oscillations in time vanish. Apart from this, the
data for all considered system sizes agree very well. We
calculate the local von Neumann entropy in the canonical

2. Quench from the MI to the MC phase

Figure 9 shows our results for a quench from the MI
to the MC phase. Here, the quench energy is much
smaller, probing the postquench spectrum at its lower
edge. Similar to the previously discussed quench, the
changes in all observed quantities occur very rapidly: af-
ter a very short transient time a relaxation to a steady-
state value occurs. The zero-quasimomentum occupa-
tions of neither the atoms nor the molecules change
signiﬁcantly as a function of time. Also, the molecu-
lar density increases only slightly. The most dramatic
change happens in the von Neumann entropy which
shows a very steep increase and then stays constant.
Again, the ﬁnite size of the system introduces fast os-
cillations whose amplitudes decrease as system size is
increased. The molecular density reaches its long-time
limit during the observed time as indicated by the di-
agonal ensemble average (dashed line in Fig. 9(c)). For
this quench the relative diﬀerence between diagonal and
m ≈ 2%. For

3. Post-quench eigenstate expectation values

The relaxation of the system to a steady state
can be understood from the distribution of diago-

relates the notion of thermalization in a closed quan-
tum system to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
(ETH) [49, 51, 52], which is a widely used concept in this
ﬁeld (see, e.g., [50] and references therein). We summa-
rize its essence here.

value computed in a thermal ensemble. Since in our
closed quantum system, energy, particle number and vol-

where ∆E is a small width around the mean energy E
and N gives the number of states with an energy inside
that energy window. The eigenstate thermalization hy-
pothesis (ETH) [49, 51, 52] makes a statement of how
the above equation Eq. (30) can be fulﬁlled: It will in
general work out when (i) the |cn|2 sample just a very
narrow energy region (comparable to ∆E) and (ii) the
Onn are a sharp distribution and thus only a function of
energy in the region that the |cn|2 sample.

We now consider the distribution of postquench eigen-
states expectation values of the molecular density as
an example. First,
let us note that for our system,
the initial-state overlap |cn|2 with the eigenstates of the
postquench Hamiltonian is already a relatively narrow
function of the energy on the system sizes considered (see
Figs. 10(b) and Fig. 11(b)).

Figure 10(a) shows the distribution of postquench
eigenstate expectation values for the quench from the
MC to the AC+MC phase in a system of size L = 6. Al-
ready on such a small system, the DPQEV is a smooth
and fairly sharp distribution for energies located in the
bulk of the eigenspectrum. By comparing to the overlap
of the initial state with the eigenstates of the postquench

12

Figure 11 shows the DPQEV for the quench from the
MI to the MC phase for system sizes L = 4, 6. The
data for L = 4 show plateaus at integer values of the
number of molecules (similar to the double occupancy
in the strongly interacting regime of the Fermi-Hubbard
model [53]). Increasing the system size introduces more
eigenstates with intermediate (i.e., non-integer) molecu-
lar particle numbers but a general plateau structure can
still be discerned. The initial state overlaps |cn|2 are
again a strongly peaked function of the energy. Compar-
ison to the DPQEV shows that it does not sample the
bulk of the system but that this quench puts the system
at the edge of the spectrum, where the ETH is expected
to work only for very large systems (see, e.g., [50, 54–56]).
Nevertheless, our numerical results indicate a reasonable
agreement between the diagonal and thermal ensembles
already on fairly small systems.

B. Structure of optimal modes

This section illustrates the dynamics of the optimal-
mode spectra for the two quenches. Results for the ﬁrst
quantum quench are shown in Fig. 12(a)-(d). For small
values of t/ta, the mode spectra are the ones from the MI
phase as shown in Fig. 5. Generally, the spectra change
signiﬁcantly as a function of time: They start from states
in the NT = 0, 2, 4, 6 subspaces and change into states
in the NT = 0, 1, 2 subspaces. We can compare those to
Fig. 6 and ﬁnd that after some time only the α = 1 mode
(Fig. 12(b)) is the same as in the ground state deep in
the AC+MC phase while the other three evolve to dif-
ferent structures. Of course, this is no surprise as during
the quench we pump energy into the system, leading to
a ﬁnal state that is generally not the post-quench ground
state. Apart from this we can read oﬀ that the contri-
bution of atoms increases. This is visible in the ﬁnal
distribution of the bare states: The three most impor-
tant bare modes in the steady state after the quench are
the ones with N (1)
a = 0, 1, 2. Also, we see in the third
and fourth mode that the molecular contribution gets
suppressed with time. The high weight of the N (1)
T = 0
mode implies that there are increased ﬂuctuations in lo-
cal particle number in the steady state.

Results for the second quench are shown in Fig. 13(a)-
(d). We see that the evolution to the ﬁnal optimal-mode
structure is very fast (takes less than ∼ 2ta). This is
similar to the behavior of the quantities shown in Fig. 9.
In Fig. 9 we see that the number of molecules is not
greatly inﬂuenced by the quench. The fact that the high-
est weighted bare mode is again the N (1)
T = 0 one sug-
gests that ﬂuctuations increase as time progresses.

Generally, the largest changes in the optimal-mode
spectra happen over the same time window in which the
local entropy S(1)
vN varies signiﬁcantly. To ﬁnd out if the
optimal modes are thermal we compare the mode spec-
trum in the steady state with the optimal modes calcu-

Hamiltonian plotted in Fig. 10(b), we ﬁnd that the initial
state is very sharply peaked at an energy (E − E0)/L ≈
4ta which is well inside the bulk of the eigenspectrum
where the DPQEV is a sharp distribution, practically
depending only on energy. We therefore conclude that
in this case the ETH works (as expected for a generic
quantum many-body system) and thus the system ther-
malizes, consistent with our numerical observations.

13

In summary, we analyzed the single-site reduced den-
sity matrix in the Bose-Bose resonance model both in
equilibrium and in quantum quenches. As an example we
considered the case of double ﬁlling NT = 2L. Since this
model features two bosonic species, atoms and molecules,
and since their individual particle numbers are not con-
served, the local reduced density matrix is not diagonal
in the basis of local bare modes (being eigenstates of both
atomic and molecular particle number). The analysis of
the equilibrium properties shows that phase transitions
can lead to features in the local von Neumann entropy.
For the phase transition between the MC and AC+MC
phase one has to consider the ﬁrst derivative of the local
von Neumann entropy with respect to the detuning pa-
rameter. At the boundary, this quantity shows a sharp
maximum. For the phase transition from the MI to the
MC phase one can use the diﬀerent L-dependence of the
local von Neumann entropy on the MI and MC sides
of the phase boundary. In the MI phase, the local von
Neumann entropy saturates to a ﬁnite value from below
while in the MC phase we show that it saturates to a ﬁ-
nite value from above. The point at which this monotony
behavior in the system-size dependence changes is close
to the known value for this phase transition.

We further studied the optimal modes and their
weights as a function of the control parameters for both
trajectories through the phase diagram. These quantities
are shown to be diﬀerent when one considers the system
at a point deep in either one of the three phases. Moni-
toring the change of the ﬁrst few most important modes
as a function of the control parameters along the two
trajectories we conclude that they also reﬂect the phase
transition.

Finally, we performed two quantum quenches along the
two trajectories where we start from the ground state in
one phase and quench the system over to the ﬁnal param-
eters. For those quenches we study the fraction of atoms
and molecules which are at quasimomentum k = 0, the
density of molecules and the local von Neumann entropy
as a function of time. We also compute the diagonal and
canonical ensemble averages for the molecular density
and ﬁnd that both agree quite well with the steady-state
value. The good agreement with the canonical expecta-
tion value is, for the ﬁrst quantum quench, explained by
the sharply peaked initial state and the sharp distribution
of postquench eigenstate expectation values (and there-
fore the realization that the conditions for the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis to apply are fulﬁlled, already
on small systems).

We ﬁnally considered the optimal-mode spectra as
a function of time and observe that their steady-state
structure is clearly diﬀerent from the structure in both
the initial state and in the ground state at the postquench
parameters. Most importantly, the comparison of the
steady-state values of the single-site entanglement en-
tropy and the optimal modes to the canonical ensemble

mal in the steady state.

The decomposition of the local reduced density ma-
trix into weights and optimal modes does not only give
physical insight but can also be used to design numerical
methods [19, 22, 57], following the ideas of [15], suggest-
ing to set up an eﬀective basis using the eigenstates of
single-site reduced density matrices plus truncation in
their spectrum. In principle, this method can be used to
greatly reduce the local state space in a controlled way.
This has been shown to work for the ground state of the
Holstein model using ED [57], a matrix-product state
method applied to the spin-boson model [19], and more
recently, also for the time evolution in electron-phonon
problems using the time evolving block decimation al-
gorithm [22]. The application of such ideas to ground-
state DMRG algorithms for electron-phonon systems is
an open problem. Considering the behavior of the single-
site entanglement entropy and of the optimal modes, the
Hubbard-Holstein model is an interesting candidate for
further studies, since the structure of the optimal modes
can be richer than in the system considered here. A fur-
ther sophistication of the model would be to allow for a
dispersion of phonons.

This section details the calculation of the behavior of
the local von Neumann entropy as a function of system
size for the case of the non-interacting Bose-Hubbard
model. For this system the weights of the local reduced
density matrix can be calculated exactly [46]
