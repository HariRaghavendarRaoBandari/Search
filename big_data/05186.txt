Acoustic Scattering from Corners, Edges and

Circular Cones

Johannes Elschner ∗, Guanghui Hu †

March 17, 2016

Abstract

Consider the time-harmonic acoustic scattering from a bounded penetrable ob-
stacle imbedded in an isotropic homogeneous medium. The obstacle is supposed
to possess a circular conic point or an edge point on the boundary in three dimen-
sions and a planar corner point in two dimensions. The opening angles of cones and
edges are allowed to be any number in (0, 2π)\{π}. We prove that such an obstacle
scatters any incoming wave non-trivially (i.e., the far ﬁeld patterns cannot vanish
identically), leading to the absence of real non-scattering wavenumbers. Local and
global uniqueness results for the inverse problem of recovering the shape of a pen-
etrable scatterers are also obtained using a single incoming wave. Our approach
relies on the singularity analysis of the inhomogeneous Laplace equation in a cone.

Introduction

Consider a time-harmonic acoustic wave incident onto a bounded penetrable scatterer
D ⊂ Rn (n = 2, 3) embedded in a homogeneous isotropic medium. The incident ﬁeld
uin is supposed to satisfy the Helmholtz equation

∆w + k2w = 0

in Rn,

(1.1)

with the wavenumber k > 0. Throughout the paper we suppose that uin does not vanish
identically and that the complement De := Rn\D of D is connected. The acoustic
properties of the scatterer can be described by the refractive index function q ∈ L∞(Rn)
such that q ≡ 1 in De. Hence, the contrast function 1 − q is supported in D. The wave
propagation is then governed by the Helmholtz equation

∆u + k2q u = 0

in Rn.

(1.2)

In (1.2), u = uin + usc denotes the total wave where usc is the scattered ﬁeld satisfying
the Sommerfeld radiation condition

Across the interface ∂D, we assume the continuity of the total ﬁeld and its normal
derivative,

u+ = u−,

∂ν u+ = ∂νu− on ∂D.

(1.4)
Here the superscripts (·)± stand for the limits taken from outside and inside, respectively,
and ν ∈ Sn−1 := {x ∈ Rn : |x| = 1} is the unit normal on ∂D pointing into De. The
unique solvability of the scattering problem (1.2), (1.3) and (1.4) in H 2
loc(Rn) is well
known (see e.g., [6, Chapter 8]). In particular, the Sommerfeld radiation condition (1.3)
leads to the asymptotic expansion

usc(x) =

eik|x|

|x|(n−1)/2 u∞(ˆx) + O(cid:18) 1

|x|n/2(cid:19) ,

|x| → +∞,

(1.5)

uniformly in all directions ˆx := x/|x|, x ∈ Rn. The function u∞(ˆx) is an analytic function
deﬁned on Sn−1 and is referred to as the far-ﬁeld pattern or the scattering amplitude.
The vector ˆx ∈ Sn−1 is called the observation direction of the far ﬁeld. The classical
inverse medium scattering problem consists of the recovery of the refractive contrast 1−q
or the boundary ∂D of its support from the far-ﬁeld patterns corresponding to one or
several incident plane waves. This paper is concerned with the following two questions:
(i) Does a penetrable obstacle scatter any incident wave trivially (that is, usc ≡ 0) ?
(ii) Does the far-ﬁeld pattern of a single plane wave uniquely determine the shape of a

penetrable obstacle ?

A negative answer to the ﬁrst question means that acoustic cloaking cannot be achieved
using isotropic materials, while a positive answer to the second one implies uniqueness
in inverse medium scattering with a single plane wave. It is widely believed that these
assertions are true for a large class of scatterers; however, little progress has been made
so far. If D trivially scatters any Herglotz wave function of the form

uin(x) =ZSn−1

exp(ikx · d) g(d) ds(d),

g ∈ L2(Sn−1),

then λ = k2 is called non-scattering energy, or equivalently, k is called non-scattering
wavenumber ; see [2]. A negative answer to the ﬁrst question obviously leads to the
absence of non-scattering energies. Moreover,
it implies that the relative scattering
operator (or the so-called far-ﬁeld operator [6]) has a trivial kernel and cokernel at
every real wavenumber, which is required by a number of numerical methods in inverse
scattering. Recall that k > 0 is called an interior transmission eigenvalue associated
with the potential q in D if the coupling problem

(cid:26) ∆w + k2w = 0, ∆u + k2qu = 0

∂ν w = ∂ν u

w = u,

in D,
on ∂D.

(1.6)

has at least one non-trivial solution (w, u) ∈ H 1(D) × H 1(D) such that w − u ∈ H 2
0 (D);
see e.g., [4,7,8,38]. A non-scattering wavenumber must be an interior transmission eigen-
value associated with the given potential, but not vice versa. An interior transmission

2

eigenvalue k is a non-scattering wavenumber only if the eigenfunction that satisﬁes the
Helmholtz equation (1.1) in D can be analytically extended as an incident wave into the
whole space. We remark that the second question is more diﬃcult than the ﬁrst one. In
fact, D cannot scatter any incident wave trivially if D could be uniquely determined by
a single far-ﬁeld pattern of any incoming wave. However, we do not know whether the
reverse statement holds (see Theorem 2.1 and Remark 3.2 (i)).

The answer to the uniqueness question provides an insight into whether or not the
measurement data are suﬃcient to determine the unknowns, playing an important role
in numerics (e.g., using optimization-based iterative schemes). The shape identiﬁca-
tion problem in inverse scattering with a single far-ﬁeld pattern is usually diﬃcult
and challenging, because it is a formally determined inverse problem, that is, the di-
mensions of the data and the unknowns are the same. For sound-soft obstacles, local
uniqueness results were proved in [9, 16, 37]. Global uniqueness results have been ob-
tained within the class of polyhedral or polygonal sound-soft and sound-hard scatterers
(e.g., [1, 5, 11, 20, 30]), using the reﬂection principle for the Helmholtz equation under
the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. However, the proofs of these local
and global uniqueness results do not apply to penetrable scatterers. See also [25, 29]
for the proof with inﬁnitely many plane waves based on ideas of Schiﬀer and Isakov.
Earlier uniqueness results in inverse medium scattering were derived by sending plane
waves with distinct directions at a ﬁxed frequency (see e.g., [13,22,25]), which results in
overdetermined inverse problems. Intensive eﬀorts have also been devoted to the unique
determination of the variable contrast 1−q from knowledge of the far-ﬁeld patterns of all
incident plane waves or by measuring the Dirichlet-to-Nuemann map of the Helmholtz
equation. We refer to [32, 36] and [6, Chapter 10.2] for the uniqueness in 3D and to
recent results [3, 21] in 2D with certain regularity assumptions on the potential.

The study of non-scattering energies dates back to [28] in the case of a convex corner
domain, with the main emphasis placed upon the exploration of the notion of scattering
support for an inhomogeneous medium.
In the recent paper [2], it was shown that
a penetrable scatterer having C ∞-potentials with a rectangular corner scatters every
incident wave non-trivially. The argument there is based on the use of complex geometric
optics (CGO) solutions, and the approach was later extended to the cases of a convex
corner in R2 and a circular conic corner in R3 whose opening angle is outside of a
countable subset of (0, π) (see [35]). In the authors’ previous work [12], any corner in
R2 and any edge in R3 are shown to be capable of scattering every incident wave non-
trivially if the potential is real-analytic. In addition, the shape of a convex penetrable
obstacle of polygonal or polyhedral type can be uniquely determined by a single far-ﬁeld
pattern. The approach of [12] relies on the expansion of solutions to the Helmholtz
equation with real-analytic potentials. The CGO-solution methods of [2,35] also lead to
uniqueness in shape identiﬁcation but are conﬁned so far to convex polygons in R2 and
rectangular boxes in R3 with H¨older continuous potentials (see [19]).

The aim of this paper is to verify uniqueness and the absence of real non-scattering
wavenumbers in a more general setting. We shall consider curvilinear polygons in R2, and
curvilinear polyhedra and circular cones in R3 (see Section 2 for a precise deﬁnition) with

3

an arbitrary piecewise H¨older continuous potential. We present a novel approach that
relies heavily on the corner singularity analysis of solutions to the inhomogeneous Laplace
equation in weighted H¨older spaces. If a penetrable obstacle scatters an incoming wave
trivially or two distinct penetrable obstacles generate the same far-ﬁeld pattern, one can
always ﬁnd a solution to the Helmholtz equation (1.1) in the exterior of an obstacle
D which extends analytically across a sub-boundary of D. However, we prove that in
conic and wedge domains non-trivial solutions to the Helmholtz equation with certain
boundary data cannot be analytically extended into a full neighborhood of the corner and
edge points because of both the interface singularity and the medium discontinuity; see
Lemmas 3.1, 4.1, 5.1 and 6.1. Our approach is diﬀerent from those in [12,35] and extends
the results of [2, 12, 19, 35] to a large class of potential functions and corner domains.
Moreover, we obtain a local uniqueness result for the inverse scattering problem with
a single incoming wave and the global uniqueness within the class of convex polygons
and polyhedra with ﬂat surfaces; see Theorem 2.2 and Corollary 2.1.
It should be
remarked that our arguments are applicable to the case of more general incident ﬁelds
(see Remark 3.1), because only local properties of the Helmholtz equation are needed
in our case of penetrable obstacles with singular boundary points. However, the far-
ﬁeld behaviour of the total ﬁeld seems to be necessary in the unique determination of a
general impenetrable scatterer.

The paper is organized as follows. Our results will be presented and veriﬁed in the
subsequent Sections 2 and 3. The proofs can be reduced to the analysis of a coupling
problem between Helmholtz equations with diﬀerent potentials near a boundary corner
point; see Lemma 3.1. We ﬁrst carry out the proof of Lemma 3.1 for polygons in Section
4.2 and then generalize the arguments to polyhedra in Section 5 by applying the partial
Fourier transform. The techniques will be adapted to handle curvilinear polygons and
polyhedra, and circular cones in Sections 6 and 7.
In Sections 4.1 and 7.1, we shall
state the auxiliary solvability results for the Laplace equation in weighted Sobolev and
H¨older spaces for two and three dimensional cones, respectively. The proofs of several
propositions that are used in Sections 4-7 will be carried out in the appendix.

ball centered at P with radius a > 0, and by I the n-by-n identity matrix in Rn×n. For
simplicity we write Ba(O) = Ba.

We ﬁrst introduce the concepts of (planar) corner points in R2, and edge and circular
conic points in R3; see Figure 1 for illustration of planar corners of a curvilinear polygon.

Deﬁnition 2.1. (see e.g., [31, Chapter 1.3.7]) Let D be a bounded open set of R2.
The point P ∈ ∂D is called corner point if there exist a neighbourhood V of P , a
diﬀeomorphism Ψ of class C 2 and an angle ω = ω(P ) ∈ (0, 2π)\{π} such that

∇Ψ(P ) = I ∈ R2×2, Ψ(P ) = O, Ψ(V ∩ D) = Kω ∩ B1.

(2.1)

We shall say that D is a curvilinear polygon, if for every P ∈ ∂D, (2.1) holds with
ω(P ) ∈ (0, 2π).
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let D ⊂ R3 be a bounded open set. The point P ∈ ∂D is called a
vertex if there exist a neighbourhood of V of P , a diﬀeomorphism Ψ of class C 2 and a
polyhedral cone Π with the vertex at O such that ∇Ψ(P ) = I ∈ R3×3, Ψ(P ) = O and
Ψ maps V ∩ D onto a neighbourhood of O in Π. P is called an edge point of D if

Ψ(V ∩ D) = (Kω ∩ B1) × (−1, 1)

(2.2)

for some ω(P ) ∈ (0, 2π)\{π}. We shall say that D is a curvilinear polyhedron if, for
every point P ∈ ∂D, either (2.2) applies with ω(P ) ∈ (0, 2π) or P ∈ ∂D is a vertex.

A curvilinear polygon resp. polyhedron allows both curved and ﬂat surfaces near a
corner resp. edge point (see Figures 1 and 2). The conditions (2.1) and (2.2) exclude
peaks at O (for which the opening angle of the planar sector is 0 or 2π).

opening angle 2ω ∈ (0, 2π)\{π} (right).

Let (r, θ, ϕ) be the spherical coordinates of x = (x1, x2, x3) ∈ R3. Let C = Cω be an

inﬁnite circular cone in R3 deﬁned as (see Figure 2)

C := {(r, θ, ϕ) : r > 0, 0 < θ < ω, 0 ≤ ϕ < 2π}

(2.3)

for some ω ∈ (0, π)\{π/2}. Clearly, the vertex of C is located at the origin and the
opening angle of C is 2ω ∈ (0, 2π)\{π}. The cone Cω is identical with the half space
x3 > 0 if ω = π/2.
Deﬁnition 2.3. We say that a bounded open set D ⊂ R3 has a circular conic point
P ∈ ∂D if D∩ Ba(P ) coincides with C∩ Ba for some a > 0 up to a coordinate translation
or rotation. D is called a circular conical domain if it has at least one circular conic
point.

Let D be a bounded penetrable obstacle in Rn, with O ∈ ∂D being a planar corner
point in R2, and an edge or circular conic point in R3. Denote by W κ,p and H κ = W κ,2
the standard Sobolev spaces. We make the following assumption on q in a neighborhood
of O.

Assumption (a): There exist l ∈ N0, s ∈ (0, 1), ǫ > 0 such that
q ∈ C l,s(D ∩ Bǫ) ∩ W l,∞(Bǫ), ∇l (q − 1) 6= 0

at O.

(2.4)

Note that the potential has been normalized to be one for x ∈ De due to the homogeneity
of the background medium, and that for l ≥ 1 the relation ∇l (q − 1) 6= 0 at O means
that at least one component of the vector ∇l q(O) does not vanish.

6

By the assumption (a), q is required to be C l,s continuous up to the boundary only in
a neighborhood of O. The relation (2.4) with l = 0 means the discontinuity of q at O, i.e.,
q(O) 6= 1, and has been assumed in [2, 12, 19, 35] in combination with other smoothness
conditions on q|D near O. A piecewise constant potential such that q|D ≡ q0 6= 1 fulﬁlls
the assumption (a) with l = 0. When l ≥ 1, it follows from the Sobolev imbedding
relation W l,∞(Bǫ) ⊂ C l−1(Bǫ) that the function q is C l−1-smooth in Bǫ, implying that
q(x) = 1 + O(|x|l) as |x| → 0 in D. Physically, this means a lower contrast of the
material on D ∩ Bǫ compared to the background medium.

The main results of this paper are stated as follows.

Theorem 2.1. Under the assumption (a), a penetrable obstacle with a planar corner
point in R2, and with an edge or a circular conic point in R3 scatters every incident
wave non-trivially.

Theorem 2.1 implies the absence of real non-scattering wavenumbers in curvilinear
polygonal and polyhedral domains as well as in circular conic domains. To answer
the second question mentioned in Section 1, we present our uniqueness results in the
following theorem and corollary (see Figure 3 for geometrical illustration).

Theorem 2.2. Let Dj (j = 1, 2) be two penetrable obstacles in Rn (n = 2, 3). Suppose
that the potentials qj associated to Dj fulﬁll the assumption (a) for each corner, edge and
circular conic point. If ∂D2 diﬀers from ∂D1 in the presence of a corner, edge or circular
conic point lying on the boundary of the unbounded component of Rn\(D1 ∪ D2), then
the far-ﬁeld patterns corresponding to Dj and qj incited by any incoming wave cannot
coincide.

Clearly, the geometrical assumptions in Theorem 2.2 are fulﬁlled if D1 and D2 are
convex curvilinear polygons or polyhedra whose singular boundary points do not co-
incide.
In particular, the latter always holds if D1 and D2 are two distinct convex
polygons and polyhedra with piecewise ﬂat boundaries. Hence, we obtain the following
global uniqueness results for the inverse scattering problem.

Corollary 2.1. If the potential fulﬁlls the assumption (a) near each corner resp. vertex,
then the shape of a convex penetrable polygon resp. polyhedron with ﬂat sides can be
uniquely determined by a single far-ﬁeld pattern.

3 Proofs of Theorems 2.1 and 2.2

We ﬁrst show the regularity of the total ﬁeld in H¨older spaces depending on the smooth-
ness of the potential.
loc(Rn) be a solution to the Helmholtz equation (∆+q)u = 0
Proposition 3.1. Let u ∈ H 2
in Rn, n = 2, 3, and let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded Lipschitz domain. Assume l ∈ N0. If
∇jq ∈ L∞(Rn) for all j = 0, 1,··· , l, then u ∈ C l+1,α(Ω) ∩ H l+2(Ω) for all α ∈ [0, 1).

Figure 3: D1 and D2 cannot generate the same far-ﬁeld pattern due to the presence
of the corner point O ∈ (∂D2\∂D1) ∩ ∂Ω, where Ω is the unbounded component of
R2\(D1 ∪ D2). The corner point P lies on ∂D2\∂D1, but P /∈ ∂Ω.

loc(Rn) for all p ≥ 2, and by elliptic regularity u ∈ W 2,p

Proof. By Sobolev’s imbedding theorem (see e.g., [15]), we know that u ∈ C(Rn) for
n = 2, 3. Therefore qu ∈ Lp
loc (Rn).
Moreover, again applying Sobolev’s imbedding theorem (see [15, Theorem 7.26]) yields
W 2,p(Ω) ⊂ C 1,α(Ω) for α = 2−n/p−1. This implies the assertion with l = 0 by choosing
the index p ≥ 2 arbitrarily large. In the general case of l ≥ 1, one can prove by induction
that qu ∈ W l,p
(Rn) and u ∈ C l+1,α(Ω) for
all α ∈ [0, 1).

loc(Rn) for all p ≥ 2, giving rise to u ∈ W l+2,p

The proofs of our results essentially rely on the following lemma.

Lemma 3.1. Let D ⊂ Rn (n = 2, 3) be a bounded domain. Assume that q ∈ L∞(D)
satisﬁes the assumption (a) near the boundary point O ∈ ∂D and that q ≡ 1 in Rn\D.
It is supposed that one of the following cases holds:
(i) O is a planar corner point if D ⊂ R2 is a curvilinear polygon;
(ii) O is an edge point if D ⊂ R3 is a curvilinear polyhedron;
(iii) O is the vertex of some circular cone if D ⊂ R3 is a circular conic domain.
For ǫ > 0 suﬃciently small, let Γǫ = ∂D ∩ Bǫ be a sub-boundary of ∂D containing O. If
the solution pair uj ∈ H 2(Bǫ) (j = 1, 2) solves the coupling problem

∆u1 + k2u1 = 0,
∂j
ν(u1 − u2) = 0

∆u2 + k2q u2 = 0

in Bǫ,

on Γǫ,

j = 0, 1, 2,··· , l + 1,

(3.1)

8

then u1 = u2 ≡ 0 in Bǫ. Here the number l ∈ N0 is speciﬁed by the regularity of q in the
assumption (a).

Note that when l = 0, the transmission conditions in (3.1) are reduced to the classical

TE transmission conditions:

u1 = u2,

∂νu1 = ∂νu2

on Γǫ.

Lemma 3.1 with l = 0 can be interpreted as follows: The Cauchy data of non-trivial
solutions to the two Helmholtz equations in (3.1) do not coincide on the boundary Γǫ if
the values of the potentials involved are not identical at O ∈ Γǫ. In other words, there
are non-trivial solutions to the Helmholtz equation ∆u1 + k2u1 = 0 in De ∩ Bǫ that
cannot be analytically extended into a full neighborhood of O due to both the interface
singularity at O ∈ Γǫ and the discontinuity of q at O. For l ≥ 1, the transmission
conditions in (3.1) are well deﬁned by Proposition 3.1. Below we shall prove our results
by applying Lemma 3.1.

Proof of Theorem 2.1. Consider the scattering problem (1.1)-(1.5) for the pen-
etrable obstacle D ⊂ Rn. Denote by O ∈ ∂D the planar corner point in R2, the edge
point or the circular conic point in R3. By Proposition 3.1, the total ﬁeld u has the
regularity

u ∈ C l+1,α(D ∩ Bǫ) ∩ H l+2(D ∩ Bǫ)

for all α ∈ [0, 1)

under the assumption (a). Hence, if the scattered ﬁeld vanishes identically, there hold
the transmission conditions

∂j
ν u = ∂j

ν uin

on Γǫ,

j = 0, 1,··· , l + 1,

where Γǫ ⊂ ∂D contains O. Now, applying Lemma 3.1 to u1 = uin and u2 = u gives
uin ≡ 0 in Bǫ. By unique continuation, uin ≡ 0 in Rn, which is a contradiction.
(cid:3)
Proof of Theorem 2.2. Denote by (Dj , qj) (j = 1, 2) the two penetrable obstacles
and the associated potentials. If the far-ﬁeld patterns incited by some incoming wave
corresponding to (D1, q1) and (D2, q2) coincide, then by Rellich’s lemma the scattered
ﬁelds must also coincide in the unbounded component Ω of Rn\(D1 ∪ D2). Suppose
without loss of generality that there exists a corner O ∈ ∂D2 ∩ ∂Ω such that O /∈ ∂D1
(see Figure 3). Then, one can ﬁnd a small ǫ > 0 such that D1 ∩ Bǫ = ∅. Applying
Lemma 3.1 to the domain D := D2 ∩ Bǫ with uj being the total ﬁelds corresponding
to (Dj, qj), j = 1, 2, we ﬁnally get u1 ≡ 0 in D and thus u1 ≡ 0 in Rn. This implies
1 := u1 − uin can be extended to the whole space as a solution
that the scattered ﬁeld usc
to the Helmholtz equation with the wavenumber k2. Hence, usc
1 ≡ 0 and thus uin ≡ 0
in Rn. This contradiction implies that (D1, q1) and (D2, q2) cannot generate identical
far-ﬁeld patterns.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.1. The proofs of our results carry over to all non-vanishing incident ﬁelds that
satisfy the Helmholtz equation (1.1) in a neighborhood of D, including the incident point

Remark 3.2. It is not straightforward to generalize the global uniqueness result of Corol-
lary 2.1 to the class of all curvilinear polygons and polyhedra, because in general one
cannot always ﬁnd a singular boundary point in a neighbourhood of which the wave
ﬁeld is analytic; see the proof of Theorem 2.2. Due to the same reason, our approach
for proving Corollary 2.1 does not apply to non-convex polygons and polyhedra. For a
non-convex scatterer, the unique determination of its convex hull follows from the proof
of Theorem 2.2. We refer to [1, 5, 11, 20, 30] where non-convex impenetrable polygons
and polyhedra were treated, relying on reﬂection principles for the Helmholtz equation
in combination with properties of incident plane or point source waves.

Remark 3.3. Lemma 3.1 does not hold in the absence of interface singularities on Γǫ,
for instance, if Γǫ is an analytic surface. To see this, we let l = 0, q|D ≡ q0 6= 1, and
suppose that Γǫ = {−ǫ < x1 < ǫ} ⊂ R2 is a line segment. Then it is easy to check that

u1 = e−ikx2 +

1 − q0
1 + q0

eikx2,

u2 =

1 + q0

e−ikq0x2,

are non-trivial solutions to (3.1). In fact, u1 and u2 denote respectively the unique total
and transmitted ﬁelds in the upper and lower half spaces incited by the incoming wave
exp(−ikx2) incident onto x2 = 0 from above.

The rest of this paper is devoted to the proof of Lemma 3.1 for curvilinear polygons
and polyhedra in Sections 4-6, and for circular cones in Section 7. In the case of l = 0
and a real-analytic refractive index q on D ∩ Bǫ, an alternative and more straightforward
proof was presented in [12] for polygons and polyhedra with ﬂat surfaces.

4 Corners in 2D always scatter

This section is concerned with the acoustic scattering from a penetrable polygon with a
piecewise linear boundary in R2. The curvilinear polygons will be treated later in Section
6. Our approach relies on the singularity analysis of the inhomogeneous Laplace equation
in a sector. We refer to the fundamental paper [26] and the monographs [17, 31, 33] for
a general regularity theory of elliptic boundary value problems in domains with non-
smooth boundaries.

(4.1)

where the sum is taken over all j ∈ N such that jπ/ω ∈ (2 + α − γ, 2 + α − γ1). For the
Neumann problem, the sin functions in (4.1) should be replaced by the cos functions.

Let Pκ be the set of homogeneous polynomials of degree κ ∈ N0 in Rn. Below we
present a special solution to the two-dimensional Laplace equation when the right hand
side is a homogeneous polynomial; see [33, Section 2.3.4].

Proposition 4.4. Consider the inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem ∆Dv = pκ ∈ Pκ in
K ∈ R2. There exists a special solution of the form

v = qκ+2
if

For the Neumann problem ∆N v = pκ ∈ Pκ, a special solution takes the same form

v = qκ+2 + CN rκ+2 {ln r cos(κ + 2)θ − θ sin(κ + 2)θ} , CN ∈ C,

if (κ + 2)ω/π ∈ N.

4.2 Proof of Lemma 3.1 for polygons
Let K ⊂ R2 be an inﬁnite sector with the angle ω ∈ (0, 2π)\{π}. Recall that B1 is
the unit disk centered at the origin O. Assume q ∈ C l,s(K ∩ B1) for some l ∈ N0, s ∈
(0, 1) satisfying q ≡ 1 in B1\K. Consider the coupling problem between the Helmholtz
equations

∆u1 + k2u1 = 0,
∂j
ν (u1 − u2) = 0 on ∂K ∩ B1, j = 1, 2,··· , l + 1,

∆u2 + k2qu2 = 0

in B1,

(4.3)

where ∂j
ν denotes the normal derivative of order j at ∂K and ν is the unit normal
pointing into the exterior of K. The proof of Lemma 3.1 for a polygon with piecewise
linear boundary follows straightforwardly from the lemma below, which implies that
corners in 2D always scatter.
Lemma 4.1. Let u1, u2 ∈ H 2(B1) be solutions to (4.3), and suppose that q satisﬁes the
assumption (a) near the corner O with D := K ∩ B1. Then u1 = u2 ≡ 0 in B1.

Lemma 4.1 will be proved by applying the solvability results of the Laplace equation

β = Λ κ,α

Proof. Obviously, u1 is real-analytic in B1 and by Proposition 3.1,

u2 ∈ C l+1,α(B1) ∩ H l+2(B1)

for all α ∈ [0, 1).

Hence, the traces of u1 and u2 on ∂K ∩ B1 occurring in (4.3) are all well deﬁned. For
clarity we shall divide the proof into ﬁve steps.

Step 1. Setting u := u1 − u2, we have

∆u + k2qu = k2(1 − q)u1
∂j
νu = 0

in K ∩ B1,

on ∂K ∩ B1, j = 1, 2,··· , l + 1.

Let ˜v = ∇lu. Then ˜v ∈ C 1,α(K ∩ B1)∩ H 2(K∩ B1) solves the following Cauchy problem
for the Laplace equation with an inhomogeneous right hand side

∆˜v = −k2∇l(qu) + k2∇l(hu1)

in K ∩ B1,

˜v = ∂ν ˜v = 0 on ∂K ∩ B1,

where h := 1 − q. Here and in the following a scalar diﬀerential operator is assumed to
act componentwise on a vector function.
We shall analyze the singularity of ˜v near the corner O. Since the solvability results
in Propositions 4.1-4.3 refer to the case of an inﬁnite cone, we will introduce a new
boundary value problem deﬁned over K. For this purpose, we choose a cut-oﬀ function
χ ∈ C ∞

(4.4)

We shall study the boundary value problem (4.4) in the weighted H¨older spaces Λ2,α
β (K)
(β ≤ 1) introduced in Section 4.1 where the weight β will be improved step by step. The
inhomogeneous term f in (4.4) belongs to C 0,α(K) and thus to Λ 0,α
for all α ≤ s, while
v ∈ C 1,α(K) ∩ H 2(K). Recall that s is the H¨older exponent of q.

r → 0.

Hence, by Proposition 4.1 with β = 0, v is the unique solution of (4.4) in the weighted
Sobolev space V 2
0,N ; note that 1 6= jπ/ω for all j ∈ N0 since the opening angle
ω ∈ (0, 2π)\{π}. On the other hand, since f ∈ Λ0,α
for all β ≥ 1, by Propositions 4.2
and 4.3 there are unique solutions vD/N of the ﬁrst equation in (4.4) satisfying vD ∈ Λ2,α
and vN ∈ Λ2,α
β,N for all β ≥ 1 suﬃciently close to 1 and α > 0 suﬃciently small. Note
that, for those α and β, 2 + α − β 6= jπ/ω for all j ∈ N. Moreover, vD/N ∈ Λ2,α
implies
that χvD/N ∈ V 2
for some β > 1, it is easy to check that
(1 − χ)vD/N ∈ V 2

Consider the boundary value problems

(4.7)

Applying Proposition 4.4 with κ = 0 yields special solutions v0,D, v0,N to (4.7) of the
form

v0,D = q2,D + cD r2 {ln r sin 2θ + θ cos 2θ} ,
v0,N = q2,N + cN r2 {ln r cos 2θ − θ sin 2θ} ,

(4.8)

where q2,D/N ∈ P2, cD/N ∈ C satisfy

∆q2,D/N = p0,
For the (unique) solution v ∈ Λ2,α

cD/N = 0 if

Using (4.6), one can readily check that

∆w0,D = f0 − [∆, χ] v0,D =: g0,D ∈ Λ0,α

w0,D = χ Xj
w0,N = χ Xj

dD,j rjπ/ω sin[(jπ/ω)θ] + ˜wD,

dD,j ∈ C,

dN,j ∈ C,

˜wD ∈ Λ2,α

˜wN ∈ Λ2,α

(4.9)

where the sums in (4.9) are both taken over all j ∈ N such that jπ/ω ∈ (1 + α, 2 + α),
or equivalently, jπ/ω ∈ (1 + α, 2]. Comparing (4.8), (4.9) and recalling that v solves
both the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems, we obtain the following
expressions as r → 0:
v =Xj
=Xj

dD,j rjπ/ω sin[(jπ/ω)θ] + q2,D + cD r2 {ln r sin 2θ + θ cos 2θ} + O(r2+α)
dN,j rjπ/ω cos[(jπ/ω)θ] + q2,N + cN r2 {ln r cos 2θ − θ sin 2θ} + O(r2+α).

(4.10)

Note that both ˜wD and ˜wN are subject to the decay of order O(r2+α) near the corner.
Letting r → 0 and using the linear independence of the sin and cos functions, we get the
relations (see Section 7.2 for the proof in the more complicated case of circular cones)

cD = cN = 0,

dD,j = dN,j = 0

if

jπ/ω < 2.

Hence, the lowest order term of v near O takes the form

dD r2 sin 2θ + q2,D = dN r2 cos 2θ + q2,N =: q2 ∈ P2,

where dD = dN = 0 if ω 6= π/2, 3π/2. Moreover, the polynomial q2 must satisfy
q2 = ∂ν q2 = 0 on ∂K and the equations

∆q2 = ∆q2,D = ∆q2,N = p0 ∈ P0,

∆2q2 = 0

in K.

Making use of Proposition A.1 in the Appendix, we then get q2 ≡ 0, so that p0 = 0.
This implies that v ∈ Λ2,α
0 . Finally, the relation u1(O) = 0 follows from (4.5) and the
deﬁnition of p0 in (4.6).

Step 4. For any m ∈ N, we show via induction that, for α > 0 suﬃciently small,

f ∈ Λ 0,α

v ∈ Λ 2,α

or equivalently,

It is easy to observe that ˜wD/N = O(r2+m+α) as r → 0. Hence, it follows from (4.13) by
letting r → 0 that

cD = cN = 0,

dD,j = dN,j = 0

if

jπ/ω < m + 2 ;

see again the proof of Lemma 7.1 for the details. Therefore, the lowest order term qm+2
of v near O belongs to Pm+2 and satisﬁes

∆qm+2 = ∆qm+2,D/N = pm ∈ Pm, ∆2qm+2 = ∆pm = 0 in K

qm+2 = ∂ν qm+2 = 0

on ∂K.

Using Proposition A.3 in the Appendix we arrive at qm+2 ≡ 0. Consequently, it follows
that pm ≡ 0 and u1,m ≡ 0 which implies the relations in (4.11).
Step 5. We have proved that ∇ju1(O) = 0 for all j ∈ N0 in the previous step.
Hence, u1 ≡ 0 in B1 due to the analyticity. Finally, the vanishing of u2 follows from the
unique continuation for elliptic equations; see e.g. [23, Chapters 3.2 and 3.3] for a proof
based on Carleman estimates. This ﬁnishes the proof of Lemma 4.1.

5 Edges in 3D always scatter

This section is devoted the proof of Lemma 3.1 for a polyhedron with ﬂat surfaces.
Consider an inﬁnite wedge domain W = K × R in R3, where the notation K still stands
for a sector with the opening angle ω ∈ (0, 2π)\{π}. For simplicity we write x′ = (x1, x2)
so that x = (x′, x3) ∈ R3. Analogously, the origin O ∈ R3 can be written as O = (O′, 0)
where O′ = (0, 0) ∈ R2. Let Ua = {x ∈ R3 : x2
2 < 1,|x3| < a} be a cylinder of height
2a for some a > 0. Then O ∈ ∂W ∩ U1 is an interior edge point. Let ∆ = ∆x and ∆x′
be the three and two dimensional Laplace operators with respect to the variables x and
x′, respectively. Suppose that q ∈ C l,s(W ∩ U1) for some s ∈ (0, 1) and l ∈ N0 and that
q ≡ 1 in W e ∩ U1. As the counterpart of (4.3) in 3D, we consider the problem

ν (u1 − u2) = 0 on ∂W ∩ U1, j = 1, 2,··· , l + 1.

in U1,

(5.1)

The analogue of Lemma 4.1 in a wedge domain is formulated as follows.
Lemma 5.1. Assume that q satisﬁes the assumption (a) with D := W ∩ U1 near the
edge point O. Let u1, u2 ∈ H 2(U1) be a solution pair to (5.1). Then u1 = u2 ≡ 0 in U1.
Based on Lemma 5.1 one can prove that an edge with an arbitrary opening an-
gle ω ∈ (0, 2π)\{π} scatters every incident wave non-trivially (see Section 3). Below
we extend the arguments for proving Lemma 4.1 to a wedge domain by using partial
Fourier transform. Lemma 3.1 in the case of a polyhedron with ﬂat surfaces is a direct
consequence of Lemma 5.1.
Proof. By Proposition 3.1, u := u2 − u1 ∈ C l,α(U 1) ∩ H l+2(U1) for all α ∈ [0, 1). To
prove the lemma, we set h := 1 − q and v(x) := χ(x′)ϕ(x3)∇l
0 (K) is
the cut-oﬀ function introduced in the proof of Lemma 4.1 and ϕ ∈ C ∞
0 (−1, 1) satisﬁes
ϕ ≡ 1 in (−1/2, 1/2). Then v ∈ C 1,α(W) ∩ H 2(W) is a solution to the inhomogeneous

w(x′, ξ) := χ(x′)Fw0(x′, ξ) = Fv(x′, ξ).

Applying the partial Fourier transform to (5.2), we obtain a Cauchy problem for the
two-dimensional Laplace equation in the inﬁnite sector K depending on the parameter
ξ ∈ R:

∆x′w(x′, ξ) = Ff0(x′, ξ) + ξ2w(x′, ξ) =: f (x′, ξ)
w(·, ξ) = ∂ν w(·, ξ) = 0

in K,
on ∂K.

(5.3)

Note that the right hand side f is analytic in ξ for any ﬁxed x′ ∈ R2. Moreover, for all
ξ ∈ R, we have for α ≤ s that

w(·, ξ) ∈ C 1,α(K) ∩ H 2(K),

f (·, ξ) ∈ C 0,α(K) ⊂ Λ0,α

1 (K)

and

f (·, ξ) − f (O′, ξ) ∈ Λ0,α

0 (K).

Applying Step 2 in the proof of Lemma 4.1 to (5.3) yields w(·, ξ) ∈ Λ2,α
1,N (K),
if 0 < α < s is chosen suﬃciently small. Further, by arguing analogously to Step 3 in
the proof of Lemma 4.1 we obtain

1,D(K) ∩ Λ2,α

f (·, ξ) ∈ Λ0,α
0 ,

f (O′, ξ) = 0, w(·, ξ) ∈ Λ2,α

0,D(K) ∩ Λ2,α

∀ ξ ∈ R.

Together with (5.3) this leads to Ff0(O′, ξ) = 0 for all ξ ∈ R and thus f0(O′, x3) = 0,
x3 ∈ R. In view of the deﬁnition of f0 on the right hand side of (5.2) we see that

continuity of ∇l
xh(O) 6= 0, we get
u1(O′, x3) ≡ 0 for |x3| suﬃciently small. Further, u1(O′, x3) ≡ 0 for all x3 ∈ R by the
analyticity, and in particular u1(O) = 0.

Note that the relations in (5.5) for m = 1 have been veriﬁed in the previous step and
that the last relation in (5.5) implies that, for all x3 ∈ R,
u1(x′, x3) − u1,m(x′, x3) = O(|x′|m+1) as

|x′| → 0.

(5.6)

The right hand side of the equation in (5.3) takes the form (cf. (5.2))

To estimate the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (5.7), we use (5.6) and the assumption
on q to derive the decompositions

h(x′, x3) u1(x′, x3) = h(O′, x3) u1,m(x′, x3) + O(|x′|l+m+1),
x[h(x′, x3)u1(x′, x3)] = ϕ(x3)∇l

ˆpm(x′, ξ) = X|β|=m

˜cβ(ξ) x′β,

˜cβ(ξ) := F(cid:16)ϕ(x3)∇l

x[h(O′, x3)] cβ,m(x3)(cid:17) (ξ).

Note that the coeﬃcients ˜cβ are analytic on R and belong to L1(R), since the functions
ϕ∇l
x[h(O′, x3)]cβ,m are continuous and have a compact support on R. Applying the
arguments in the proof of Lemma 4.1, we may conclude that the lowest order term
Qm+2(·, ξ) of w(·, ξ) near the corner of K belongs to Pm+2 and satisﬁes the Cauchy
problem

∆x′Qm+2(·, ξ) = ˆpm(·, ξ)
Qm+2(·, ξ) = ∂ν Qm+2(·, ξ) = 0

in K,
on ∂K

for all ξ ∈ R.

Since Fpm(x′,·) ∈ L1(R), its inverse Fourier transform is given by

pm(x′, x3) = ϕ(x3)∇l

x[h(O′, x3)] u1,m(x′, x3).

(5.9)

(5.10)

Recalling the induction hypothesis that u1,j(x′, x3) ≡ 0 for all 0 ≤ j < m (see (5.4) and
(5.5)), we get

u1(x′, x3) = u1,m(x′, x3) + O((|x′| + |x3 − t|)m+1),

as |x′| → 0, x3 → t for all t ∈ R. Hence, u1,m coincides with the lowest order term U1,m
in the Taylor expansion of u1 at (x′, t) ∈ R3. As a consequence of Proposition A.2 (iii),
it holds for all x3 ∈ R that ∆x′u1,m(x′, x3) = ∆xU1,m ≡ 0 and thus

∆x′(pm(x′, x3)) = ϕ(x3)∇l

x[h(O′, x3)] ∆x′u1,m(x′, x3) ≡ 0.

(5.11)

19

Taking the partial Fourier transform of (5.11) with respect to x3 gives

∆x′ ˆpm(x′, ξ) ≡ 0 for all

ξ ∈ R.

Together with (5.9) this implies that Qm+2(·, ξ) is a biharmonic function with vanishing
Dirichlet and Neumann data on ∂K. Now, applying Proposition A.3 to Qm+2 gives the
relations Qm+2(·, ξ) = ˆpm(·, ξ) ≡ 0 for all ξ ∈ R, which further result in

f (·, ξ) ∈ Λ0,α

x[h(O′, x3)]

−m(K), w(·, ξ) ∈ Λ2,α

pm ≡ 0.
Since ∇l
it follows from (5.10) that
u1,m(x′, x3) ≡ 0 in a neighborhood of the plane x3 = 0 in R3. Hence, u1,m ≡ 0 in
R3 due to the analyticity. This proves the relation ∇mu1 = 0 at O. Since m ∈ N0 is
arbitrary, the relation u1 ≡ 0 follows. Finally, we obtain u2 ≡ 0 by unique continuation.
The proof of Lemma 5.1 is thus complete.

6 Curvilinear polygons and polyhedra always scatter

In this section we shall adapt the arguments in Sections 4.2 and 5 to the case of a
curvilinear polygon or polyhedron. Lemma 3.1 in the cases (i) and (ii) can be equivalently
stated as

Lemma 6.1. Let D be a bounded curvilinear polygon or polyhedron and let the potential
q satisfy the assumption (a) near a corner or edge point P ∈ ∂D. For ǫ > 0 suﬃciently
small, let Γǫ = Bǫ(P ) ∩ ∂D be a sub-boundary of ∂D such that P ∈ Γǫ. If the solution
pair uj ∈ H 2(Bǫ(P )) (j = 1, 2) solves the coupling problem (3.1), then u1 = u2 ≡ 0.
Proof. For brevity we only indicate the changes that are necessary to reduce the case
of a curvilinear domain to a sector or wedge domain. We start with the same argument
as in the proof of Lemmas 4.1 and 5.1 by choosing an appropriate cut-oﬀ function χ in
a neighbourhood of P in D. Consequently, the function v := χ(x)∇l
x(u1 − u2) satisﬁes
the boundary value problem (cf. (4.4) and (5.2))

∆ v = f

in D ∩ Bǫ(P ),

v = ∂νv = 0 on Γǫ

(6.1)

for some H¨older continuous function f supported in a neighborhood of P in D. Denote
by y = Ψ(x), y = (y1, y2,··· , yn), x = (x1, x2,··· , xn), the diﬀeomorphism speciﬁed in
Deﬁnitions 2.1 and 2.1 mapping a curvilinear domain near P to a sector or wedge domain
with ﬂat boundaries. For notational convenience we write U = K in two dimensions and
U = W = K × R in three dimensions. Under the transformation
y ∈ Rn,

˜f (y) = f (Ψ−1(y)),

˜v(y) = v(Ψ−1(y)),

we have

∆y ˜v = ∆xv(Ψ−1(y)) − g˜v(y) = ˜f (y) − g˜v(y)
˜v = ∂ν ˜v = 0

in U ,
on ∂U .

Here δij is the Kronecker delta symbol. Compared to the right hand sides of (4.4) and

holds that

aij(y) − δij = O(|y|),

bi(y) = O(1)

as y → O,

i, j = 1, 2,··· , n.

Hence, if ˜v ∈ Λ2,α

−m(U )

for some qm ∈ Pm. Further, the relation qm ≡ 0 then implies the vanishing of pm and
also of the m-th order terms in the Taylor expansion of u1 at P . Applying the arguments
in the proof of Lemmas 4.1 and 5.1 to the equation (6.2), we successively obtain qm ≡ 0
for all m ∈ N0, which implies u1 = u2 ≡ 0.

7 Circular cones always scatter

This section is concerned with the scattering problems corresponding to a penetrable
obstacle with circular conic corners on the boundary. We ﬁrst present the solvability of
the Laplace equation in a three-dimensional cone and then verify Lemma 3.1 in the case
(iii).

7.1 Solvability of the Laplace equation in a circular conic domain

Let C be the inﬁnite circular cone introduced in Section 2.3. For β ∈ R, κ ∈ N0 and
α ∈ [0, 1), we deﬁne the weighted spaces V κ
β,D/N (C) in
the same way as in Section 4.1, where only the sector K ⊂ R2 is replaced with the cone

C ⊂ R3 and r denotes the distance of x to the conic point O. In this section we denote
by ∆D resp. ∆N the operator of the Dirichlet resp. Neumann problem corresponding
to the inhomogeneous Laplace equation with the homogeneous boundary condition on
∂C acting on the spaces V κ
β,D/N (C). Consider the Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary value problems

β,D/N (C) and Λκ,α

Using spherical coordinates we may rewrite the Laplace operator as

∆D u = f,

∆N u = f

on C.

β (C),
we shall apply Kondratiev’s method [26] by looking for solutions of the homogeneous
problems (7.1) (i.e., f = 0) in the form u(x) = rλV (ˆx) with ˆx = x/r ∈ S2; cf. [33]
and [27]. Then V satisﬁes the eigenvalue problem

on ∂Ω.

(7.2)

The Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of (7.2), λD,j and λN,j (j ∈ Z\{0}), counted
with their ﬁnite multiplicities, form a discrete set in R. Further, there are corresponding
orthogonal (in L2(Ω)) sequences of eigenfunctions Vj,D and Vj,N (see e.g. [27, Chapter
2]).

Below we present a more explicit description of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in
our case of a circular cone. For this purpose we need the deﬁnition of Legendre functions
and spherical harmonic functions. For λ ∈ R, denote by Pλ the Legendre function of
ﬁrst kind satisfying the Legendre diﬀerential equation

d

dt(cid:20)(1 − t2)

df

dt(cid:21) + λ(λ + 1)f = 0.

(7.3)

By P m
via

λ (m ∈ N0) we denote the associated Legendre functions of the ﬁrst kind deﬁned

which satisfy the associated Legendre diﬀerential equations

Recall that the normalized spherical harmonic functions of order n ∈ N0 are deﬁned by

n (θ, ϕ) :=s 2n + 1

4π

P |m|
n (cos θ) eimϕ

(7.5)

(n − |m|)

λ (cos ω) = 0 resp. (P |m|

for all m = −n,··· , n. By [10], λ ∈ R is an eigenvalue to the Dirichlet resp. Neu-
mann boundary value problem (7.2) if and only if there exists some m ∈ Z such
that P |m|
λ )′(cos ω) = 0, with the associated eigenfunction V =
P |m|
λ (cos θ)eimϕ ∈ C ∞(Ω).
In the special case that λ = n ∈ N and |m| ≤ n − 1,
the eigenfunction V = P |m|
n (cos θ)eimϕ is a spherical harmonic function of order n and
rnV ∈ Pn is a homogeneous polynomial of order n. Note that Dirichlet and Neu-
mann eigenvalues may coincide. For instance, if (P 0
2(cos ω) = 0, then
P 1
2 (cos ω) = sin ω(P 0
2 )′(cos ω) = 0, implying that λ = 2 is both a Dirichlet and Neu-
mann eigenvalue. Since P m

2 )′(cos ω) = P ′

λ = P m

−λ−1, we have

λD/N,−j = −λD/N,j − 1,

λD,1 > 0, λN,1 = 0, λN,−1 = −1.

Below we state the solvability results for the Laplace equation in the weighted spaces

β (C).

β (C) and Λ2,α

Proposition 7.1. ( [33, Chapter 3, Theorem 5.1]) The operator ∆D/N : V 2
V 0
β (C) is an isomorphism if 1/2 − β 6= λD/N,j for all j ∈ Z\{0}.
Proposition 7.2. ( [33, Chapter 3, Theorem 6.11]) The operator ∆D/N : Λ2,α
Λ0,α
β (C) is an isomorphism if 2 + α − β 6= λD/N,j for all j ∈ Z\{0}.
Proposition 7.3. ( [33, Chapter 3, Theorem 6.9]) Let γ1 < γ ≤ 2 and assume 2+α−β 6=
λD/N,j for β = γ, γ1 and for all j ∈ N. Moreover, let f ∈ Λ0,α
γ1 (C) and denote
by vβ ∈ Λ2,α
β (C). Then the

Cj rλD/N,j Vj, D/N (ˆx), Cj ∈ C

holds, where the sum is taken over all j ∈ N such that λD/N,j ∈ (2 + α − γ, 2 + α − γ1).
The following is a special case of [33, Chapter 3, Lemma 5.11] with additional infor-

mation in the case of a circular cone.

Proposition 7.4. For κ ∈ N0, consider the inhomogeneous problem ∆D/N v = pκ ∈ Pκ
on C. There exists a special solution of the form

vD/N = qD/N,κ+2 ∈ Pκ+2

(7.6)

if λD/N,j 6= κ + 2 for all j ∈ N, and

v = qD/N,κ+2 +Xm

κ+2(ˆx) + ψD/N,m(ˆx)(cid:9)
if κ + 2 is a Dirichlet resp. Neumann eigenvalue. In (7.7), CD/N,m ∈ C, ψD/N,m ∈
C ∞(Ω) and the sum is taken over all m ∈ Z such that |m| ≤ κ and P |m|
κ+2(cos ω) = 0 in
the Dirichlet case and (P |m|

CD/N,m rκ+2(cid:8)ln r Y m

κ+2)′(cos ω) = 0 in the Neumann case.

(7.7)

23

Proof. Applying Proposition A.2 (i), we may expand pκ ∈ Pκ as

n

pκ(r, θ, ϕ) = rκ Xn,j∈N0:n+2j=κ

Xm=−n

a(j)
n,m Y m

n (θ, ϕ).

Hence, it suﬃces to prove the proposition for a term of the form

pκ(x) = rκ Y m

n (ˆx)

for some

0 ≤ n ≤ κ, |m| ≤ n.

(7.8)

One can readily look for a polynomial qκ+2 to the equation ∆qκ+2 = pκ in the form

qκ+2(x) = ζ rκ+2 Y m

n (ˆx),

ζ =

1

(κ + 2)(κ + 3) − n(n + 1)

.

(7.9)

We ﬁrst consider the Dirichlet boundary value problem. In the case κ + 2 6= λD,j for all
j, we have P |m|

κ+2(cos ω) 6= 0. Setting
qD,κ+2(x) := qκ+2(x) − qκ+2(r, ω, ϕ)P |m|

κ+2(cos θ)/P |m|

κ+2(cos ω),

we obtain the requested polynomial solution. Now we assume that κ + 2 is a Dirichlet
eigenvalue of (7.2) with the associated eigenfunction V = Y m
κ+2, which implies that
P |m|
κ+2(cos ω) = 0. As in [33, Chapter 3] we make the ansatz

vD(r, ˆx) = c rκ+2 ln r Y m

(7.10)
with an unknown constant c ∈ C and an unknown function W to be determined from
the Dirichlet boundary value problem

κ+2(ˆx) + rκ+2 W (ˆx)

ˆ∆W + (κ + 2)(κ + 3)W = −c(2κ + 5)Y m

κ+2 + Y m

n =: F

W = 0

in Ω = C ∩ S2,
on ∂Ω,

(7.11)

where the number n ∈ N0 is the same as that in (7.8). Note that if W solves the previous
boundary value problem, then the solution vD of the form (7.10) must be a Dirichlet
eigenfunction to (7.2). The constant c will be selected such that the right hand side F
is orthogonal to Y m

κ+2 in the L2(Ω)-sense, i.e.,
n Y m

c =

RΩ Y m

(2κ + 5)RΩ |Y m

κ+2 ds
κ+2|2 ds

.

Hence the problem (7.11) admits at least one solution by the Fredholm alternative. Now
we may rewrite vD in (7.10) as

where qκ+2 = ζ rκ+2 Y m

vD = qκ+2 + CD,m rκ+2(cid:8)ln rY m
n ∈ Pκ+2 satisﬁes the equation ∆qκ+2 = pκ (see (7.9)) and
ψD,m = (W − ζY m

κ+2 + ψD,m(cid:9) ,

n )/c, CD,m = c.

Hence we obtain the assertion for the Dirichlet boundary value problem with our special
right hand side. The case of the Neumann boundary condition can be treated analo-
gously.

7.2 Proof of Lemma 3.1 for circular cones
Recall that B1 is the unit ball centered at the origin O and that C ⊂ R3 is an inﬁnite
circular cone with the angle 2ω ∈ (0, 2π)\{π}. Assume q ∈ C l,s(C ∩ B1) for some
l ∈ N0, s ∈ (0, 1), satisfying q ≡ 1 in B1\C. Consider the coupling problem between the
Helmholtz equations

∆u1 + k2u1 = 0,
∂j
ν (u1 − u2) = 0 on ∂C ∩ B1, j = 1, 2,··· , l + 1,

∆u2 + k2qu2 = 0 in B1,

(7.12)

where ∂j
ν denotes the normal derivative of order j at ∂C and ν is the unit normal pointing
into the exterior of C. The following lemma implies Lemma 3.1 in the case (iii) and the
fact that a circular cone scatters each incident wave non-trivially.
Lemma 7.1. Let u1, u2 ∈ H 2(B1) be a solution pair to (7.12), and suppose that q
satisﬁes the assumption (a) near the vertex O with D := C ∩ B1. Then we have u1 =
u2 ≡ 0 in B1.
Proof. We shall proceed following the lines in the proof of Lemma 4.1. In order to avoid
repeating the arguments used in Section 4.2, we only indicate the necessary changes for
circular cones. For simplicity we shall carry out the proof for H¨older continuous poten-
tials only, i.e., under the assumption (a) with l = 0. Hence, we have q ∈ C 0,s(C ∩ B1)
and q(O) 6= 1. The general case of l ≥ 1 can be treated analogously to the proof of
Lemma 4.1.
0 (C) and setting v :=
χ(u1 − u2), we have by Proposition 3.1 that v ∈ C 1,α(C) ∩ H 2(C) for all α ∈ [0, 1).
Further,

Step 1. Choosing an appropriate cut-oﬀ function χ ∈ C ∞

∆v = −k2χ qu + k2χ hu1 − [∆, χ]v =: f
v = ∂ν v = 0

on ∂C,

in C,

(7.13)

with h = 1 − q. Here the commutator [·,·] is deﬁned in the same way as in Section 4.2.
Applying Proposition 7.1 with β = −1/2 and using the vanishing of the Cauchy data
on ∂C, it follows that v is the unique solution of (7.13) in V 2
−1/2(C). Note that we have
λD/N,j 6= 1 for all j ∈ N, because

P 0
1 (cos ω) = cos ω 6= 0,
1 (cos ω) = −(P 0
P 1
(P 1
1 )′(cos ω) = − cos ω/ sin ω 6= 0

1 )′(cos ω) = sin ω 6= 0,

for all ω ∈ (0, π)\{π/2}. On the other hand, by Propositions 7.2 and 7.3, there exist
unique solutions vD/N of the ﬁrst equation in (7.13) satisfying vD/N ∈ Λ2,α
β,D/N (C) for all
β ≥ 1 suﬃciently close to 1 and α > 0 suﬃciently small. Note that 2 + α − β 6= λD/N,j
for those α, β and all j ∈ N. Since vD/N ∈ Λ2,α
β (C) for some β > 1, it is easy
1,D(C) ∩ Λ2,α
to check that vD/N ∈ V 2

1 (C) ∩ Λ2,α
−1/2(C). Hence v = vD = vN ∈ Λ2,α

1,N (C).

0 (C) and u1(O) = 0, we rewrite the right

p0 := k2 h(O) u1(O) ∈ P0,

f0 := f − χp0 ∈ Λ0,α

0 (C),

(7.14)

and consider the boundary value problems ∆D/N v0 = p0 on C. Applying Proposition
7.4 with κ = 0 yields special solutions vD/N,0 of the form

vD,0(x) = qD,2(x) + cD r2(cid:8)ln r Y 0
vN,0(x) = qN,2(x) + cN r2(cid:8)ln r Y 0

2 (ˆx) + ψD,0(ˆx)(cid:9) ,
2 (ˆx) + ψN,0(ˆx)(cid:9) ,

(7.15)

where qD/N,2 ∈ P2 satisfy ∆qD/N,2 = p0, ψD/N,0 ∈ C ∞(Ω), cD = 0 if P2(cos ω) 6= 0 and
cN = 0 if P ′
1 . It follows from (7.14) that

2(cos ω) 6= 0. Set wD/N,0 := v − χ vD/N,0 ∈ Λ2,α

∆wD/N,0 = f0 − [∆, χ]vD/N,0 ∈ Λ0,α

0 (C) ∩ Λ0,α

1 (C).

Applying Proposition 7.3 with γ1 = 0, γ = 1 and α > 0 suﬃciently small, we get the
representations

(7.16)

dD/N,j rλD/N,j Vj,D/N (ˆx) + ˜wD/N

wD/N,0 = χ Xj
with dD/N,j ∈ C, ˜wD/N ∈ Λ2,α
D/N,0(C), where (λD/N,j, Vj,D/N ) is the eigensystem corre-
sponding to (7.2) and the sum is taken over all j ∈ N such that λD/N,j ∈ (1 + α, 2]. Here
the eigenvalues are counted with their multiplicities. Note that we may assume that
there are no Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of (7.2) in the interval (2, 2 + α). Com-
bining (7.15) with (7.16) and recalling that v solves both the Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary value problems, we obtain the following expressions for v as r → 0:
2 + ψD,0(cid:9) + O(r2+α)
2 + ψN,0(cid:9) + O(r2+α),

dD,j rλD,j Vj,D(ˆx) + qD,2 + cD r2(cid:8)ln r Y 0
dN,j rλN,j Vj,N (ˆx) + qN,2 + cN r2(cid:8)ln r Y 0

v = Xj
= Xj

(7.17)

from which we get the relations (see Step 3 below for the proof in the general case)

cD/N = 0,

dD/N,j = 0 if λD/N,j < 2.

Equating the lowest order terms in (7.17) as r → 0 allows us to deﬁne q2 ∈ P2 as

q2 := qD,2 + r2 Xj∈N:λD,j=2

dD,j Vj,D(ˆx) = qN,2 + r2 Xj∈N:λN,j=2

dN,j Vj,N (ˆx).

Using ∆rλD/N,j Vj,D/N = 0 and Proposition 4.3, we get

∆q2 = ∆qD,2 = ∆qN,2 = p0 ∈ P0,

∆2q2 = 0

in C.

26

Moreover, q2 has vanishing Cauchy data q2 = ∂νq2 = 0 on ∂C. Applying Proposition
A.4 in the Appendix, we arrive at q2 ≡ 0, so that p0 = 0. This implies that v ∈
Λ2,α
0 (C). Finally, the relation u1(O) = 0 follows from the deﬁnition of p0 in (7.14) and
the assumption q(O) 6= 1.
Step 3. Assume for some m > 1, m ∈ N and α > 0 suﬃciently small that
1−m(C), ∇ju1(O) = 0 for all j ∈ N0, j ≤ m − 1.

f ∈ Λ 0,α

v ∈ Λ 2,α

1−m(C),

(7.18)

We want to show in this step that

f ∈ Λ 0,α

−m(C),

v ∈ Λ 2,α

−m(C), ∇mu1(O) = 0.

(7.19)

Again denote by u1,m ∈ Pm the homogeneous Taylor polynomial of degree m of u1 at
O. By the last relation in (7.18), we have u1,j ≡ 0 for all j ≤ m − 1. Using Proposition
A.2 (iii) we get ∆u1,m ≡ 0.

By (7.18), the right hand side in (7.13) can be split into

f = χpm + fm,

pm := k2 h(O) u1,m ∈ Pm,

fm := f − χpm ∈ Λ 0,α

−m(C).

Repeating the arguments in Step 2, we ﬁnd that near the conic point O the function
v ∈ Λ2,α

1−m,D(C) takes the form
v = qD,m+2 + cD,κ rm+2(cid:8)ln r Y κ

as a solution to the Neumann boundary value problem. The parameters and functions
involved in (7.20) and (7.21) are described as follows:

−m,D/N (C), ψD,κ, ψN,κ′ ∈ C ∞(Ω). Hence ˜wD/N = O(rm+2+α) as r → 0.

(i) ˜wD/N ∈ Λ2,α

vanish simultaneously for 0 ≤ n ≤ m + 2; see Proposition A.5 (ii).

(iv) The sums in (7.20) and (7.21) are taken over all j ∈ N such that the eigenvalues

(v) qm+2,D/N ∈ Pm+2 satisﬁes ∆qm+2,D/N = pm ∈ Pm.

27

We ﬁrst claim that

dD/N,j = 0

if λD/N,j < m + 2.

(7.22)

For this purpose we denote by λ∗ = minj{λD,j, λN,j} the smallest exponent of r on the
right hand sides of (7.20) and (7.21). Supposing on the contrary that (7.22) does not
hold, we then have λ∗ < m + 2. Subtracting (7.20) from (7.21), multiplying r−λ∗
to
the resulting expression and letting r → 0, we arrive at dD/N,j = 0 for λD/N,j = λ∗ due
to the orthogonality of the eigenfunctions Vj,D and Vj,N . Repeating this process yields
(7.22).

The relation (7.22) implies that λ∗ = m + 2. We now multiply (rm+2 ln r)−1 to both
equalities (7.20) and (7.21) and consider the diﬀerence of the resulting expressions to
m+2 and P |κ′|
obtain cD,κ = cN,κ′ = 0, where we have used the linear independence of P |κ|
for |κ| 6= |κ′|. Hence, the lowest order term qm+2 of v near O belongs to Pm+2 and takes
the form

m+2

This further yields

qm+2 = qD,m+2 + Xj:λD,j=m+2
= qN,m+2 + Xj:λN,j=m+2

dD,j rm+2 Vj,D

dN,j rm+2 Vj,N .

∆qm+2 = pm ∈ Pm, ∆2qm+2 = ∆pm = 0 in C

qm+2 = ∂ν qm+2 = 0 on ∂C.

Again using Proposition A.4 in the Appendix, we get qm+2 ≡ 0. Consequently, pm ≡ 0
and u1,m ≡ 0, which implies the relations in (7.19).
Step 4. Having proved that ∇ju1(O) = 0 for all j ∈ N0 in the previous steps, we
obtain u1 ≡ 0 in B1 due to the analyticity. Finally, the vanishing of u2 follows from the
unique continuation for the Helmholtz equation. This ﬁnishes the proof of Lemma 7.1.

8 Appendix

In the Appendix, we prove several propositions that are used in Sections 4-6. In particu-
lar, Propositions A.1 and A.2 below extend the results of [2]. We present an alternative
method of proof relying on the expansion of real-analytic solutions, which is of indepen-
dent interest.
Proposition A.1. Suppose that (∆ + k2)u = 0 in a neighbourhood of the point O ∈ R2.
Then the two lowest order terms in the Taylor expansion of u at O are both harmonic
functions.

28

Proof. Suppose that the lowest degree in the Taylor expansion of u1 at O is M ∈ N0
and that all terms of order less than M vanish. Then the function u1 = u1(r, θ) can be
expanded into the convergent series (see, e.g., [14, Lemma 2.2])

rjFj(θ), Fj(θ) = Xn,m∈N0,n+2m=j(cid:0)c+

u = Xj∈N0,j≥M
n,m ∈ C satisfy the recurrence relations:

where c±

n,m sin nθ(cid:1) ,

n,m cos nθ + c−

(A.1)

c±
n,m+1 = −

k2

4(m + 1)(n + m + 1)

c±
n,m for all n, m ∈ N0.

In particular, the coeﬃcients of the ﬁrst three terms in the expansion are given by

F0(θ) = c+
F1(θ) = c+
F2(θ) = c+

0,0,
1,0 cos θ + c−
0,1 + c+

1,0 sin θ,
2,0 cos 2θ + c−

2,0 sin 2θ,

c+
0,1 = −c+

0,0 k2/4.

Hence, if M = 0, it is obvious that both F0 and rF1 are harmonic. If M = 1, we have
c+
0,0 = 0 and both rF1 and r2F2 are harmonic functions. Now assume that M ≥ 2. It
then holds that c±
n,m = 0 for all n + 2m ≤ M − 1. For n, m ∈ N0, m ≥ 1 such that
n + 2m = M , it follows from the recurrence relations that

c±
n,m = −

k2

4m(n + m)

c±
n,m−1 = 0,

since n + 2(m − 1) = M − 2. This implies that the lowest order term, given by

FM = c+

M,0 cos M θ + c−

M,0 sin M θ,

is harmonic. Analogously, one can prove that rM +1FM +1(θ) is also harmonic.

Next we prove the result corresponding to Proposition A.1 in 3D.

Proposition A.2. (i) A real-analytic function u = u(r, θ, ϕ) can be expanded in a

neighbourhood of the origin as follows:

u(x) = Xn,l∈N0

rn+2 l

n

Xm=−n

a(l)
n,m Y m

n (θ, ϕ),

a(l)
n,m ∈ C.

(A.2)

(ii) A solution to the Helmholtz equation (∆ + k2)u = 0 can be expanded in the form

(A.2) where the coeﬃcients a(l)

n,m fulﬁll the recurrence relations

a(l+1)
n,m = −

k2

2(l + 1)(2l + 2n + 3)

a(l)
n,m, n, l ∈ N0, m = −n,−n + 1,··· , n − 1, n.

29

(iii) Suppose that (∆ + k2)u = 0 in R3. Then the two lowest order terms in the Taylor

expansion of u at O ∈ R3 are both harmonic functions in R3.

Proof. (i) Recall that Pn denotes the collection of all homogeneous polynomials of de-
gree n ∈ N0. We denote by Hn the subset of Pn consisting of harmonic homogeneous
polynomials of degree n. Then, for any Hn ∈ Hn there holds the expansion

Hn(x) = rn

n

Xm=−n

cn,m Y m

n (θ, ϕ),

cn,m ∈ C.

(A.3)

Since Pn = Hn + |x|2 Pn−2, we obtain by induction that any pn ∈ Pn can be written in
the form

pn(x) = Xl∈N0,n−2l≥0

bl |x|2l Hn−2l(x),

bl ∈ C, Hn−2l ∈ Hn−2l.

(A.4)

Since u is real-analytic, applying the Taylor expansion and using (A.4) yields

u(x) = Xn∈N0

cn pn(x) = Xn∈N0

cn Xl∈N0,n−2l≥0

bl |x|2l Hn−2l(x).

Rearranging the terms in the previous expression, we get

u(x) = Xl∈N0

|x|2l Xn∈N0

a(l)
n Hn(x),

a(l)
n ∈ C.

which together with (A.3) proves the ﬁrst assertion.

(ii) The second assertion follows from the relation

n

∆u =

Xn∈N0,l∈N

2l (2l + 2n + 1)rn+2 l−2

2(l + 1)(2l + 2n + 3)rn+2 l

= Xn,l∈N0

a(l)
n,m Y m

n (θ, ϕ)

(A.5)

a(l+1)
n,m Y m

n (θ, ϕ).

n

Xm=−n
Xm=−n

(iii) To prove the third assertion, we rewrite the expansion (A.2) as

u(x) = Xj∈N0

rj Fj(θ, ϕ), Fj(θ, ϕ) := Xn,l∈N0,n+2l=j

Xm=−n

a(l)
n,m Y m

n (θ, ϕ).

n

Proceeding in the same way as in Proposition A.1, one can verify the third assertion.

In [2], Propositions A.1 and A.2 are veriﬁed for the lowest order term of solutions to
the Helmholtz equation only. Proposition A.3 below implies the absence of non-trivial
biharmonic functions with vanishing Dirichlet and Neumann data on the boundary of a
sector in R2.

30

Proposition A.3. Let K = Kω ⊂ R2 be the sector deﬁned in Section 2 with the opening
angle ω ∈ (0, 2π)\{π}. Suppose that u ∈ H 2(B1) solves the boundary value problem

∆2u = 0

in K,

u = ∂νu = 0

on ∂K ∩ B1.

(A.6)

Then u ≡ 0.

In [28], Proposition A.3 was proved for a homogeneous polynomial pl such that ∆pl
is harmonic. Our proof diﬀers from that in [28].
It is also elementary, since simple
calculations using Cartesian coordinates are involved only. Alternatively, Proposition
A.3 also follows from the expansion (A.1) under polar coordinates; we refer to the proof
of Proposition A.4 below where the spherical coordinates are employed to prove the
analogue of Proposition A.3 for circular cones in 3D.

Proof. Denote by τj and νj (j = 1, 2) the unit tangential and normal vectors on the two
half-lines of ∂K starting at the corner O. Since the opening angle of K is not π, the
tangential and normal vectors are linearly independent. Without loss of generality we
suppose that ν1 = c1τ1 + c2τ2 with c1, c2 ∈ R, c2 6= 0. Hence,

∂τ2 =

1
c2

∂ν1 −

c1
c2

∂τ1 .

(A.7)

We shall prove by induction that ∇mu(O) = 0 for all m ∈ N0, which implies the
proposition.

From the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions of u on ∂K we see that

u = ∇u = 0,

∂2
τ1 u = ∂2

τ2u = ∂ν1∂τ1 u = 0 at the corner O.

(A.8)

Combining (A.7) and (A.8) gives the relation ∂τ1 ∂τ2u = 0 at O. Since each entry of the
vector ∇2 can be expanded as a linear combination of ∂2
τ2 and ∂τ1∂τ2 , we obtain
∇2u = 0 at O.

τ1, ∂2

To prove that ∇3u(O) = 0, we observe that
τ1∂ν1u = ∂2

∂3
τ1u = ∂3

τ2 u = ∂2

τ2∂ν2u = 0

at O.

τ1 to both sides of (A.8) yields ∂2

Applying ∂2
τ1 ∂τ2u(O) = 0. Analogously we can get
∂2
τ2∂τ1 u(O) = 0. Hence, the relation ∇3u(O) = 0 follows from the fact that the diﬀeren-
tial operators ∂3

τ1 , ∂2

τ1∂τ2 , ∂τ1∂2

τ2 and ∂3

Now we want to verify that ∇4u(O) = 0. Arguing as in the previous step we get

τ2 span the vector ∇3.

Hence it suﬃces to prove ∂2
this follows from the identity

τ1∂2

∂4
τ1u = ∂3

τ2u = ∂4

τ1∂τ2u = ∂τ1∂3
τ2u(O) = 0. Using (A.9), ∂ν1 = c1∂τ1 + c2∂τ2 and ∆2u ≡ 0,

τ2 u = 0 at O.

(A.9)

0 = ∆2u(O) = [∂2

31

For m > 4, we make the induction hypothesis that

∇ju(O) = 0

for all j = 0, 1,··· , m.

(A.10)

We then only need to verify that ∇m+1u = 0 at O. For j ∈ N0, denote by ∇j
of all tangential derivatives of order j, i.e.,

τ the vector

Using the relations in (A.6) and (A.7) again, we have

τ1 ∂j1

τ2 u :

∇j
τ u =(cid:8)∂j1

j1, j2 ∈ N0, j1 + j2 = j(cid:9) .

∇m−3

τ1 u = ∂m

τ1 ∂τ2u = ∂τ1∂m

τ2 u = ∂m+1

τ2 u = 0 at O.

Therefore, it remains to prove that the span of the diﬀerential operators ∇m−3
τ1 ∂τ2, ∂τ1∂m
∂m

τ2 and ∂m+1

contains the vector ∇m+1

on the left hand side of the previous equation vanishes if and only if

m2ζ m−1(1 + ζ)2 + (−1)m[(−1)mζ m − 1]2 = 0.

If m ∈ N is an odd number, the previous relation implies that

m2ζ m−1 = (

Since |ζ| = 1, the modulus of the right hand side of the previous identity equals to m2

Proposition A.4. Let C = Cω ⊂ R3 be the circular cone deﬁned by (2.3) with the
opening angle 2ω ∈ (0, 2π)\{π}. Suppose that u ∈ H 2(B1) solves the boundary value
problem

∆2u = 0

in C ∩ B1,

u = ∂ν u = 0 on ∂C ∩ B1.

(A.11)

Then u ≡ 0.

Proposition A.4 extends the result of Proposition A.3 in a planar corner domain to
a circular conic domain in R3. Being diﬀerent from the proof of Proposition A.3 using
Cartesian coordinate, our proof of Proposition A.4 relies on the expansion of real-analytic
functions using the spherical coordinates.

Proof. By Proposition A.2 (ii), a real-analytic function u = u(r, θ, ϕ) in B1 can be
expanded as the following convergent series

u(x) = Xn,l∈N0

The previous relation implies that a(l+2)

n ∈ Pn+2l are linearly independent. Hence, we only need to prove that a(l)

n,m = 0 for all l, n ∈ N0 and |m| ≤ n, since
n,m = 0

the spherical harmonics (see (7.5)), we obtain the following results by inserting (A.13)

(ii) It cannot happen that P m

n (t) = (P m

n )′(t) = 0 for all 0 ≤ m ≤ n.

Proof. (i) Introduce the augmented Wronskian of the form

n−j(t)(cid:19) ,

P ′
n(t) P ′

j = 1, 2,··· , n.

The number t0 ∈ (−1, 1) is called a nodal zero of Wn if Wn has opposite signs for
t = t0 + h and t = t0 − h, h suﬃciently small. It has been shown in [24, Chapter 4,
Theorem 9] that Wn(t; j) has exactly j − 1 nodal zeros in the interval (−1, 1). Hence,
when j = 2, Wn(t; 2) has only one nodal zero t0 in (−1, 1).
If n ≥ 2 is odd, then
Pn(0) = Pn−2(0) = 0, since both Pn and Pn−2 are odd functions. This implies that
n(0) = P ′
t0 = 0 is the nodal zero of Wn(t; 2). If n ≥ 2 is even, we have P ′
n−2(0) = 0.
Hence, t0 = 0 is also the nodal zero. This proves the ﬁrst assertion with m = 0.

In the case m ≥ 1, the functions P m

n (t), n = m, m + 1,··· , satisfy the associated Leg-
endre diﬀerential equation (7.4). The proof of [24, Chapter 4, Theorem 9] depends solely
on the form of the governing equation (see (7.3) in the case of Legendre polynomials)
and extends to the associated Legendre diﬀerential equation (7.4). Hence, the determi-
nant on the right hand side of (A.15) has also one nodal zero in (−1, 1). On the other
n−2)′(0) = 0,
hand, it is easy to check that either P m
implying that t0 = 0 is the unique nodal zero. Hence, the ﬁrst assertion for m ≥ 1
follows from the proof for the Legendre polynomials.

n−2(0) = 0 or (P m

n )′(0) = (P m

n (0) = P m

(ii) The second assertion is a consequence of the fact that the zeros of P |m|
and
n )′ are all simple and strictly interlaced. Note that when |m| = n, we have the

Finally we present a corollary that extends the results of Propositions A.3 and A.4
to a more general case. It can also be considered as a local non-solvability result on the
Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation on a cone and it is proved just as Lemmas 4.1
and 7.1.
Corollary A.1. Let U be the sector Kω ⊂ R2 or the cone Cω/2 ⊂ R3 deﬁned in Section 2
with the opening angle ω ∈ (0, 2π)\{π}. Suppose that u ∈ H 2(U ∩ B1) solves the Cauchy
problem

∆u = h g

in U ,

u = ∂ν u = 0 on ∂U ∩ B1,

where h ∈ C α(U ∩ B1) for some α ∈ (0, 1), h(O) 6= 0 and (∆ + λ)g = 0 in B1 for some
λ ∈ C. Then u ≡ 0.

35

Note that Corollary A.1 does not hold in the case of a half space (ω = π) where even a
global existence result for the analytic Cauchy problem can be proved; see [18, Theorem
9.4.8].
