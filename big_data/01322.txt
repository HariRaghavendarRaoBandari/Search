EFFECTS OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM ON HALO PROFILES

Submitted for publication in ApJ, March 7, 2016

ABSTRACT

The near universality of DM halo density proﬁles provided by N-body simulations has proven to
be robust against changes in total mass density, power spectrum, and some forms of initial velocity
dispersion. In this letter we study the eﬀects of coherently spinning up an isolated DM-only progenitor
on halo structure. Halos with spins within several standard deviations of the simulated mean (λ (cid:46)
0.20) produce proﬁles with negligible deviations from the universal form. Only when the spin becomes
quite large (λ (cid:38) 0.20) do departures become evident. The angular momentum distribution also
exhibits a near universal form, which is also independent of halo spin up to λ (cid:46) 0.20. A correlation
between these epidemic proﬁles and the presence of a strong bar in the virialized halo is also observed.
These bar structures bear resemblance to the radial orbit instability in the rotationless limit.

INTRODUCTION

The ΛCDM model is considered by many to be the
most successful to date in predicting cosmological struc-
ture formation in our universe, and is often referred to
as the standard model of cosmology (see Planck Collab-
oration (2014, 2015) for a review). ΛCDM matches large
scale structure observations down to a few Mpc (Eisen-
stein et al. 2005). Even below a Mpc, ΛCDM provides
vast insight into the formation of clusters, galactic ha-
los, and sub-halos; but its limitations also become more
evident.

One of these limitations is the so-called core-cusp prob-
lem, which can be described as an inconsistency between
the inner density proﬁles of halos found in numerical sim-
ulation and those extracted from galactic observations
(Moore 1994; Flores & Primack 1994), with the density
inside a scale radius being much shallower than expected
(Walker et al. 2010). Approximating the density ρ scal-
ing as a power law at small radii (ρ ∝ rα for r → 0), Cold
Dark Matter (CDM) numerical predictions show a nearly
universal proﬁle with α = −1 or steeper, which closely
resembles the curve put forth by Navarro et al. (1996a)
(Navarro et al. 1996b; Moore 1994; Moore et al. 1998,
1999). Current observations, however, provide scaling
much closer to α = −0.5 or even ﬂat (α = 0.0) (Navarro
et al. 2010). Further, the central density of a dwarf DM
halo is observed to be constant (∼ 108M(cid:12)kpc
−3) over
multiple orders of magnitude in halo mass (Strigari et al.
2006; Gilmore et al. 2008; Hayashi & Chiba 2015).

In response to the core-cusp problem and other con-
cerns, an abundance of new physics has been proposed to
resolve a new model with the data. These theories’ eﬀects
range from heating the dark matter by power truncation
(Governato et al. 2015; Moore et al. 1999), giving the DM
the ability to repulsively self-interact through means be-
yond gravity (Moore et al. 2000; Spergel & Steinhardt
2000; Burkert 2000; Dave et al. 2001; Fry et al. 2015; Fry

2015; Vogelsberger et al. 2014; Zavala et al. 2013), to
having DM structure include its own sector of forces and
other physics (Jungman et al. 1996; Sikivie 2012). These
new physics create a model landscape, much of which is
currently unexplored.

Attempts have been made to understand the nature
of the universal proﬁle, which we will approximate us-
ing the NFW proﬁle (Navarro et al. 1996a,b). Statistical
techniques applied to this understanding include analysis
of approximate integrals of motion during entropy max-
imization (Pontzen & Governato 2012), semi-analytic
equilibrium phase-space density estimation (Taylor &
Navarro 2001; Barnes & Williams 2006), and mass ac-
cretion history (Ludlow et al. 2013). Under various con-
straints, the integral and equilibrium studies produce
NFW-like proﬁles, though there are still gaps in under-
standing of each technique’s motivations, keeping the
physical cause of NFW ambiguous. Accretion history
studies have also made progress in identifying the limits
of NFW, but still fall short in identifying the fundamen-
tal mechanisms responsible for the observed similarity.
Other semi-analytical approaches include spherical shell
collapse models, which produce results that appear to
challenge universality (Zukin & Bertschinger 2010a,b).

The evolution equations governing structure formation
are in general non-linear and, as a result, both direct
and semi-analytic approaches are used to solve them. To
date, semi-analytic methods have probed structure for-
mation before the time of ﬁrst-crossing, contributing to
topics from angular momentum distribution to the cos-
mic web (Binney & Quinn 1990; Quinn & Binney 1992;
Ryden & Gunn 1987; Casuso & Beckman 2015; Pinchon
et al. 2014; Codis et al. 2015). While these methods
cannot probe the current epoch, their form and compu-
tational eﬃciency provide agility when surveying classes
of models. To reach virialization, a full non-linear ap-
proach is needed to retain any sort of accuracy. Thank-
fully, powerful numerical schemes have been developed
which leverage the ever-increasing computational power
available. These techniques include both particle, mesh,
and hybrid codes, many with sophisticated optimizations
that allow them to scale quite eﬃciently (Jetley et al.

This letter concentrates on how computational meth-
ods have been used to study the feature of angular mo-
mentum and its role in structure formation (Bellovary
et al. 2008; Bullock et al. 2001; van den Bosch 2002;
Barnes & Efstathiou 1987; Gardner 2001; Herpich et al.
2015). Most angular momentum studies quantify a struc-
ture’s spin by the parameter λ Peebles (1969)

the perturbed density proﬁle

r0 → r1 = r0 (1 − δ(r0)/3) .

The velocity distribution is comprised of the radial ex-
pansion rate of the embedding universe, a peculiar veloc-
ity given by linear growing mode theory (Evrard 1988), a
rigid rotor condition parameterized by the spin λ, and a
random velocity seed of magnitude equal to the peculiar
velocity added to prevent singular collapse

λ =

(1)

where J is the magnitude of the total angular momen-
tum, E is the total energy, and M is the total mass of
the halo.

Angular momentum analysis of cosmological structures
has a decades-long history, with analyses that span over
both the linear and non-linear approaches. Chief among
their ﬁndings is the log-normal distribution to total halo
spins, with semi-analytics producing a mean value of
λ ∼ 0.09 (Ryden 1988) and non-linear means giving
λ ∼ 0.035 (Bullock et al. 2001; Barnes & Efstathiou
1987), both essentially contained well within the small
rotational energy limit.

This letter focuses on how halo formation is aﬀected
over the range of possible spin values and the subse-
quent diﬀerence of the density proﬁles from the univer-
sal form. In Section 2, we describe the series of N-body
isolated collapse simulations used to consistently study
spin’s contribution to a virialized halo. Section 3 dis-
plays the resulting structures and how they relate to the
universal proﬁle. Section 4 discusses what eﬀects, if any,
can be attributed to the angular momentum content of
the halo or its progenitor. We end with a summary of
these ﬁndings and potential directions for future study
in Section 5.

2. METHODS

To isolate the eﬀects of angular momentum on the
structure of halos, isolated spherical perturbations with
a range of spin values are evolved in an expanding uni-
verse to form halos of a prescribed virialized size at zero
redshift.

Initial proﬁles of the collapse are generated by the
Isolated Collapse Initial Conditions Generator (ICInG)
package (Tremmel et al. 2015), made speciﬁcally for iso-
lated spherical collapse. The initial condition distribu-
tions follow from Evrard (1988) and assume an Einstein-
deSitter cosmology. ICInG uses a glass distribution to
avoid numerical artifacts and includes the ability to im-
part angular momentum as well as random motions.

The generator begins with a density proﬁle at a pre-
scribed initial redshift zi given by a top-hat over-density
of the form

δ(r) =

δ0
2

(1 + cos (rπ/Rs)) .

(2)

where Rs is the radius of the sphere and δ0 parameterizes
the magnitude of the over-density, both of which help
specify the mass of the resultant halo.

Given a collection of particles initially distributed in
the homogeneous sphere, the radii are shifted to match

v = vhub + vpec + vrot + vrand

where

The N-body code ChaNGa is then used to evolve the
distribution using collisionless dynamics. The code uses
a Barnes-Hut tree to calculate gravity, with hexade-
capole expansion of nodes. Time-stepping is done with
a leapfrog integrator with individual time-steps for each
particle. The code base has been thoroughly tested and
has contributed to many astronomical topics including
DM candidate testing (Kim et al. 2014; Governato et al.
2015; Menon et al. 2015) 3.

Although the collapse is scale-free, we have chosen a
physical scale to simulate the equivalent of a large MW-
sized halo (Mvir ≈ 1.5× 1012M(cid:12)) starting at zi = 6 with
an eﬀective initial over-density δ0 ≈ 0.71 for all halos
save λ = 0.00, where δ0 ≈ 0.84. The progenitor parti-
cle number is ∼million with softening length ∼ 0.4 kpc,
which is more than suﬃcient to resolve core depletion at
the ∼ 4 kpc scale. The system is evolved for ∼ 10 Gyr
with a force accuracy/node opening criterion θ = 0.7
and a time-stepping accuracy such that the time-step

∆t < η(cid:112)/a, where  is the gravitational softening, a is

the acceleration of a particle, and η is an accuracy crite-
rion; we used η = 0.00013. Also note that as these are
DM-only simulations, the conﬁguration may be rescaled
to a halo size of our choosing because Newtonian gravity
is scale-free. Cosmological expansion is turned on, but
to model the system as isolated, boundary conditions are
not periodic.

the notable increase in power law within the scale radius. The

2.2 × 106M(cid:12)/kpc3, which were chosen by eye to match the low
spin proﬁles. The inset plot displays the power law behavior of
each proﬁle at 10kpc.

A diﬀerence in technique may be responsible for the discrepancy:
Bullock removed large amounts of retrograde (jz < 0) material
from the halos before proﬁling, whereas we have removed every
retrograde particle.

follow the NFW (Navarro et al. 1996a) density curve with
the slightly faster than r−1 growth towards the center
that has become expected by some for virialized halos
(Fry 2015; Moore 1994; Moore et al. 1998, 1999). Sur-
prisingly, the form persists into the higher spin halos until
λ = 0.25, which lies in the 99.9 percentile of halos accord-
ing to some N-body studies (Barnes & Efstathiou 1987;
Bullock et al. 2001). Deviations in the higher spin pro-
ﬁles, λ ∈ {0.25, 0.50}, include a divergence from the two
power law form, a shrinking virial radius, and a lowered
density, the last two of which may be partially attributed
to the limitations of ICInG in the high spin regime to set
the ﬁnal virial mass. Our deﬁnition of the virial radius
and mass are in line with Bullock et al. (2001), with the
virial radius taken to be the distance at which the aver-
age interior density equals 200 times the critical density.
The particles within the virial radius at this time are
called the virialized component, while the remainder are
the non-virialized component. The relation between the
λ values supplied to ICInG and the measured spins of
the virialized halos are provided in Table 1.

Cumulative mass proﬁles of prograde particles within
the virial radius versus speciﬁc angular momentum also
show a consistency over the lower spin halos, Fig. 2, de-
spite their initial diﬀerences in rotation rate. Bullock

et al. (2001) (BDK) performed a similar analysis and
proposed a universal proﬁle of the form

Menc(j) = Mvir

j

j − j0

,

(6)

where j is the z-component of the speciﬁc angular mo-
mentum as deﬁned by the imposed spin axis (5). This
cumulative mass uses only the prograde bodies in the
virialized halo, summing the masses of particles with spe-
ciﬁc angular momentum between 0 and j. For reasonable
λ, the inner power law (Menc ∝ jα for j ≈ 0) of the
calculated proﬁles is noticeably shallower with α ≈ 0.7.
The primary diﬀerence between our analysis and BDK’s
is the presence of some retrograde (jz < 0) constituents
due to the diﬀerences of their binning process. Due to
the consolidated proﬁles over reasonable λ, we suggest a
similar proﬁle shape for the slower halos

, α ≈ 0.7.

(7)

The diﬀerence between the proﬁles (6) and (7) points
at the existence of a retrograde component to the halo,
Fig. 3, which was not present in the initial conﬁguration.
This is curious as the approximate cylindrical symmetry
of the initial state should translate to a particle-wise near
conservation of the ˆz component of angular momentum.
Instead, these halos form a strong bar structure in the
rotation plane, Fig. 4, reminiscent of the radial orbit in-
stability (ROI) (Bellovary et al. 2008; Polyachenko 1981;
Barnes et al. 1986) in the λ → 0 limit. The presence of
a strong bar ruins the cylindrical symmetry of the initial
conditions, allowing for non-trivial particle-wise angular
momentum evolution and the presence of retrograde par-
ticles after virialization. The bar is prevalent in all of the
generated halos, save for λ = 0.25, 0.50 where it weak-
ens signiﬁcantly. The strength of the bar can, in part,
be quantiﬁed in terms of its triaxial factor (Binney &

distribution’s spherical or cylindrical symmetry evolves
exponentially into a signiﬁcant asymmetry. Bellovary
et al. (2008) (BDB) showed that for a non-rotating spher-
ical mass, velocity perturbations of the 3D thermal va-
riety disrupted the instability, but purely radial disper-
sions were ineﬀective. BDB also made the claim that
the ROI is a key physical mechanism contributing to the
nearly universal proﬁles of simulated DM halos.

Binney & Tremaine (2008) also parameterize the insta-
bility in the non-rotating small angular momentum limit:
by relating a spherical distribution’s tangential velocity
dispersion to spherical stability

ϑ2 ≥ L2/(Gρr2I)

(10)

where L is the typical angular momentum per orbit, ρ
is the typical density, r is the radial extent of the halo,
and I = Tr/(∂L∆φ)|L=0. To form a distinct bar, ϑ must
be less than 1. Other studies of this instability (Poly-
achenko 1981; Barnes et al. 1986) are performed in a
similar limit. Our work appears to expand triaxial halo
formation conditions to include those with coherent tan-
gential components.

The apparent correlation of bar strength with the con-
sistency of the universal proﬁles is an important step
towards understanding the proﬁles’ limits. Equally im-
portant is the point that the geometry forms in isolation,
with a lack of angular momentum exchange between the
virialized and nonvirialized regions. A commonality be-
tween the ROI and the bars formed in this study is the
high angular momentum dispersion relative to the av-
eraged values, which tapers oﬀ as the spin is increased.
The dispersions are also seen to decrease in size as the
bars weaken (Fig. 5, 6). If we are to make the connec-
tion between the ROI and the instabilities that we form,
this observed trend is in violation of the conclusions of
Binney and Tremaine that stability against the ROI is
driven by tangential velocity dispersion. As their con-
clusions were derived under diﬀerent conditions, namely
in a non-rotating small angular momentum limit, tan-
gential dispersion alone may be insuﬃcient to determine
a halo’s stability.

Cylindrical symmetry in the isolated halo may be re-
stored to some degree by the presence of a strong central
mass such as a BH or heavy baryonic bulge. Such objects
do not exist for certain classes of dwarf galaxies, making
our study particularly pertinent to them. Such dwarfs
may still exhibit DM cores, which must overcome this
propensity for bar creation.

5. SUMMARY

In this letter we present a study of structure formation
on isolated spherical distributions over a range of solid-
body spins. This is accomplished via ChaNGa’s gravity
solvers provided with ICInG N-body initial conditions.
Our analysis of the collapses show that, for reasonable
spin values, the radial density and angular momentum
enclosed mass proﬁles are consolidated and closely con-
form to NFW and BDK-like proﬁles respectively. Further
investigation into this conspiracy reveals that while there
is minimal exchange of angular momentum between the
virialized halo and the non-virialized remainder, a great
dispersion of angular momentum within the halo occurs,
which includes retrograde material. As no retrograde
material exists at the onset of the collapses, a breakdown

after collapse. The initial conﬁgurations for each distribution were
well represented by a rotating solid sphere, which would give a
distribution with support in positive j. The retrograde component
(jz < 0) to the ﬁnal distributions implies a breaking of the initial
axial symmetry.

that the lack of constraint on the principal axes adds

strength of axial symmetry breaking. Since we are only
interested in elongation in the plane normal to the z-
axis, a more relevant measure of bar strength is in the
bar parameter (Binney & Tremaine 2008)

Despite the breaking of cylindrical symmetry, the
transfer of angular momentum between virialized and
non-virialized components appears to be minimal over
the initial and ﬁnal conﬁgurations, Fig. 7. This eﬀective
lack of coupling implies that the instability can exist in
isolation, similar to the ROI. We can also see that the
amount of retrograde material in the halos is signiﬁcant,
and it can be shown that the density proﬁles for prograde
and retrograde components look very similar for barred
halos, and only diverge when the bar weakens.

There appears to be a theme here:

for our class of
initial distributions, the universality of the density and
angular momentum proﬁle shapes persist if and only if a
strong bar is present.

4. DISCUSSION

The NFW and enclosed mass proﬁles appear to be ro-
bust over a wide range of spin values (Fig. 1, 2). Also
present over these spins is a strong in-plane bar, which
contains large amounts of prograde and retrograde mate-
rial (Fig. 3). The formation of the bar is analogous to the
structure formed by an ROI where a slight breaking of a

Fig. 5.— Triaxality versus initial spin values for matter within a

are oblate, about 0.5 are triaxial, and close to 0 are prolate. The
virialized components appear to shift from a triaxial or partially
prolate to oblate shaped over the spin range [0.00, 0.25], with tri-
axality being resumed for λ = 0.50. This departure from the trend
may due to departure from the small angular momentum energy
limit leading to increased extent in-plane.

of the axial symmetry must occur. The breakdown takes
the form of a bar-like structure, which correlates strongly
to the persistence of the universal ρ(r) and Menc(j) pro-
ﬁles.

Based on these ﬁndings, we speculate that the NFW
and BDK proﬁles are robust over the range of proba-
ble halo spins due to susceptibility to an instability that
bears resemblance to the ROI. The breakdown of such an
instability is consistent with the departure from a low an-
gular momentum limit. A study of the robustness of axial
symmetry and spin provide insight into the nature of this
instability and its proﬁle. Also, for galaxies with a strong
central baryonic mass, a study of DM-only collapse with
enforced cylindrical symmetry is needed to eliminate spin
as a possible solution to the core-cusp problem.

Ultimately,

in the larger picture of halo formation,
where a cosmological setting leads to hierarchical halo

ponents within a virial radius and half a virial radius. The bar

formation, the role of these instabilities becomes less
clear. A halo’s history consists of periods of gentle minor
mergers, interrupted occasionally by more violent major
mergers. Bellovary et al. (2008) performs preliminary
simulations of halos subject to controlled minor and ma-
jor mergers to investigate the realistic role of the ROI,
where they speculate that the ROI does not play a sig-
niﬁcant role in the subsequent relaxation process after
a major merger. However, they also state that there
are indications of an operational ROI during the minor
merger periods, acting on nearly radial tidal streams as-
sociated with disrupted subhalos. A similar study with
non-radial inﬂow and torquing may provide insight into
the rotational regime.

Fig. 7.— Total virialized speciﬁc angular momentum versus total
nonvirialized speciﬁc angular momentum for the initial and ﬁnal
conﬁgurations of each spin. The near overlap of the initial and
ﬁnal conﬁgurations indicate that angular momentum is almost ex-
actly conserved within the virialized and nonvirialized components
individually; little to no transfer of angular momentum occurred
between the components during the collapse. The spin values of
the points increase from left to right. Note that the spin-less simu-
lation’s angular momenta are far smaller than the other runs, and
therefore do not appear.
