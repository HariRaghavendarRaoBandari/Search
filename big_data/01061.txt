ABSTRACT

Context. The physical structure of deeply embedded low-mass protostars (Class 0) on scales of less than 300 AU is still poorly
constrained. While molecular line observations demonstrate the presence of disks with Keplerian rotation toward a handful of sources,
others show no hint of rotation. Determining the structure on small scales (a few 100 AU) is crucial for understanding the physical
and chemical evolution from cores to disks.
Aims. We determine the presence and characteristics of compact, disk-like structures in deeply embedded low-mass protostars. A
related goal is investigating how the derived structure aﬀects the determination of gas-phase molecular abundances on hot-core scales.
Methods. Two models of the emission, a Gaussian disk intensity distribution and a parametrized power-law disk model, are ﬁtted
to subarcsecond resolution interferometric continuum observations of ﬁve Class 0 sources, including one source with a conﬁrmed
Keplerian disk. Prior to ﬁtting the models to the de-projected real visibilities, the estimated envelope from an independent model and
any companion sources are subtracted. For reference, a spherically symmetric single power-law envelope is ﬁtted to the larger scale
emission (∼1000 AU) and investigated further for one of the sources on smaller scales.
Results. The radii of the ﬁtted disk-like structures range from ∼ 90 − 170 AU, and the derived masses depend on the method. Using
the Gaussian disk model results in masses of 54− 556× 10−3 M(cid:12), and using the power-law disk model gives 9− 140× 10−3 M(cid:12). While
the disk radii agree with previous estimates the masses are diﬀerent for some of the sources studied. Assuming a typical temperature
distribution (r−0.5), the fractional amount of mass in the disk above 100 K varies from 7% to 30%.
Conclusions. A thin disk model can approximate the emission and physical structure in the inner few 100 AU scales of the studied
deeply embedded low-mass protostars and paves the way for analysis of a larger sample with ALMA. Kinematic data are needed
to determine the presence of any Keplerian disk. Using previous observations of p-H18
2 O, we estimate the relative gas phase water
abundances relative to total warm H2 to be 6.2 × 10−5 (IRAS 2A), 0.33 × 10−5 (IRAS 4A-NW), 1.8 × 10−7 (IRAS 4B), and < 2 × 10−7
(IRAS 4A-SE), roughly an order of magnitude higher than previously inferred when both warm and cold H2 were used as reference.
A spherically symmetric single power-law envelope model fails to simultaneously reproduce both the small- and large-scale emission.

1. Introduction

A gravitationally collapsing core of gas and dust marks the be-
ginning of the star formation process in molecular clouds. These
infall-dominated pre-stellar cores evolve into envelope domi-
nated, Class 0 sources with well-collimated bipolar outﬂows
(André et al. 2000), hinting at the presence of a disk. Once the
accretion has progressed enough, the source is classiﬁed as a
disk dominated Class I source, characterized by a more tenuous
envelope and a rotating circumstellar disk (e.g., Jørgensen et al.

Interferometer. IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG
(Germany) and IGN (Spain).

2009; Beckwith et al. 1989; Beckwith & Sargent 1993; ALMA
Partnership et al. 2015). In the subsequent Class II stage (T Tauri
source), the envelope has almost completely dissipated and the
disk is characterized by Keplerian rotation and may have devel-
oped cavities (Guilloteau & Dutrey 1994; Qi et al. 2003; Simon
et al. 2000; Williams & Cieza 2011; Espaillat et al. 2014). Al-
though there is evidence for disks at all stages of protostellar evo-
lution, they have not yet been characterized in the earliest stages.
Early simulations of collapsing rotating clouds show that large-
scale (∼ 1000 AU) ﬂattened infalling envelopes with small-scale
(∼ 100 AU) disks are expected to form (e.g., Cassen & Moosman
1981; Terebey et al. 1984; Galli & Shu 1993). Tracing the evolu-
tion of disks through the entire star formation process will make

it possible to determine when and how disks form and evolve.
The physical characteristics of this early structure therefore mark
the starting point of disk evolution studies.

Interferometric observations of deeply embedded low-mass
protostars taken with a resolution of few arcseconds have re-
vealed unresolved compact components on scales < 300 AU
(e.g., Hogerheijde et al. 1999; Looney et al. 2003; Harvey et al.
2003; Jørgensen et al. 2005b), and these structures are not ﬁt
well by standard envelope models. Rotating disks with sizes of
R < 50 ∼ 200 AU have been found for a few Class 0 sources
based on kinematical analysis on the molecular lines (e.g., To-
bin et al. 2012; Murillo et al. 2013b; Ohashi et al. 2014; Lind-
berg et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2014). This raises the questions of
how early such disks form after collapse and how common they
are. High-resolution C18O observations toward other Class 0
sources show velocity gradients perpendicular to the outﬂow to-
ward some sources (Yen et al. 2015), but not necessarily in a ro-
tationally supported disk (Brinch et al. 2009; Maret et al. 2014).
Thus, the physical conditions (i.e., density, temperature, mass) of
deeply embedded low-mass protostars on small scales are poorly
constrained.

The density and temperature structure on small scales also
aﬀect the chemistry and derived abundances. Some low-mass
protostars show strong lines of complex organic molecules that
are thought to originate from regions where the dust tempera-
ture exceeds 100 K and all ices have been sublimated (e.g., van
Dishoeck & Blake 1998; Bottinelli et al. 2004; Herbst & van
Dishoeck 2009; Öberg et al. 2014). These “hot core” or “hot
corino” regions are small (radii less than 100 AU), and abun-
dances with respect to H2 are often inferred through comparison
with a spherically symmetric power-law envelope structure, with
all material inside the 100 K radius assumed to contain subli-
mated ice material. However, in a disk-like structure some frac-
tion of this dust on a small scale may be much cooler than 100 K
(e.g., Harsono et al. 2014, 2015). This means that the abundances
of species that are only thought to exist in regions >100 K may
have been underestimated. A prominent example is water itself:
lines of H18
2 O have been imaged in low-mass protostars on sub-
arcsecond scales but inferred hot core abundances are more than
an order of magnitude lower than expected from water ice sub-
limation (e.g., Jørgensen & van Dishoeck 2010a; Persson et al.
2012, 2013; Visser et al. 2013). Water, in turn, controls available
reaction routes for other species (e.g., H2O destroying HCO+;
Jørgensen et al. 2013).

The temperature and density structures of the envelope on
larger scales (several 1000 AU) is relatively well characterized
through modeling of the spectral energy distribution and the
single-dish submillimeter continuum spatial structure (e.g., Jør-
gensen et al. 2002; Kristensen et al. 2012) and through extinc-
tion mapping at infrared wavelengths (e.g., Tobin et al. 2010).
To what extent continuum observations can be used to probe the
small-scale structures, and the related transition from the large-
scale envelope, is not yet clear.

With the increased sensitivity of interferometric data, it is
now possible to routinely obtain subarcsecond resolution contin-
uum interferometric observations at mm wavelengths. Here we
analyze such data for ﬁve deeply embedded low-mass protostars
(Class 0), including one source for which the presence of a Ke-
plerian rotating disk has been established from kinematic data.
After removing any large-scale envelope contribution, two dif-
ferent models are ﬁtted to the de-projected binned real visibility
amplitudes, a Gaussian intensity distribution, and a parametrized
disk model. Although this analysis cannot determine whether ro-
tationally supported disks are present, it can constrain the basic

parameters of any ﬂattened, compact disk-like structure such as
radius and mass. The method presented here is intended as a
proof of concept that such structures can indeed be character-
ized and that they have consequences for inferred abundances
of species such as water. These methods can subsequently be
extended and applied to current/future ALMA observations of a
large sample of low-mass protostars and to additional molecules.

2. Sample and observations
Five sources were considered in this study, the four protostars
IRAS 2A, IRAS 4A-NW, IRAS 4A-SE, and IRAS 4B in the
NGC 1333 star forming region (235 pc, Hirota et al. 2008) and
VLA 1623 in the ρ Ophiuchus star forming region (120 pc,
Loinard et al. 2008). The last source has a conﬁrmed Keplerian
disk with a radius of ∼150 AU as inferred from high-resolution
C18O data (Murillo et al. 2013b).
Observational data come from several programs.1 The con-
tinuum toward NGC 1333 IRAS 2A and 4B at 203.4 GHz has
been obtained with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI2)
by Jørgensen & van Dishoeck (2010a) and Persson et al. (2012).
One track (∼8 hours) of complimentary A conﬁguration (ex-
tended) data were obtained for IRAS 4B on 2 February 2011.
Phase and amplitude were calibrated on the quasar 0333+321,
and the absolute ﬂux on the blazar 3C454.3. The calibration
and imaging was done in IRAM GILDAS. The observations of
IRAS 4B cover (projected) baselines from 12–515 kλ (21(cid:48)(cid:48)–0(cid:48)(cid:48).5),
and for IRAS 2A they cover 10.5–307 kλ (23(cid:48)(cid:48)-0(cid:48)(cid:48).8). IRAS 4A
was observed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 335 GHz
(Lai et al. in prep). The observations of IRAS 4A cover base-
lines from 10–510 kλ (25(cid:48)(cid:48)–0(cid:48)(cid:48).5). Finally, the ALMA Cycle 2
VLA 1623 data are from Murillo et al. (2015) at 219.0 GHz
and cover baselines from 13.8–796.6 kλ (18(cid:48)(cid:48)–0(cid:48)(cid:48).3). The various
source parameters are summarized in Table 1 and the sensitivity,
beam, and peak ﬂuxes for the observations are listed in Table 2.

away (source B) and the second, which is signiﬁcantly weaker
at mm wavelengths, is ∼ 10(cid:48)(cid:48) to the east (source W).
Toward IRAS 2A, Codella et al. (2014) reported two sec-
ondary continuum sources that are 2(cid:48)(cid:48) and 2.4(cid:48)(cid:48) away, one along
the blueshifted outﬂow and one southwest of the main compo-
nent. Tobin et al. (2015a) show that IRAS 2A is a binary on
0(cid:48)(cid:48).6 scales from high sensitivity VLA observations at mm and
cm wavelengths, conﬁrming earlier speculations based on the
quadruple outﬂow (Jørgensen et al. 2004). The two secondary
continuum sources (with >5σ peak) found by Codella et al. at
2(cid:48)(cid:48) oﬀset (sensitivity of 1.5 mJy/beam) are also not seen in our
high-sensitivity PdBI data (1.6 mJy/beam). Our spatial resolu-
tion and sensitivity are not high enough to conﬁrm the close
companion found by Tobin et al. This unresolved companion is
signiﬁcantly weaker than the main source (< 3% at 1.3 mm, i.e.,
1.65σ); therefore, it will modify the amplitude in a well-behaved
manner (a very low constant value).

The continuum observations of IRAS 4B are dynamic range
limited, the peak ﬂux is 128σRMS, and the limit for PdBI is
at ∼ 80σRMS (depending on u-v coverage, for example). This
causes the low-ﬂux compact deconvolution artifacts surround-
ing the continuum peak. This is not a problem since the analysis
is conducted in the u-v-plane.

Fig. 1. Maps of the continuum toward IRAS 2A (PdBI), IRAS 4B
(PdBI), IRAS 4A (SMA), and VLA 1623 (ALMA). Contours start at
3σRMS in steps of 3σRMS until 9σRMS, then in steps of 20σRMS (σRMS in
Table 2). We note the absence of any 2(cid:48)(cid:48) triple toward IRAS 2A. The ob-
servations of IRAS 4B are dynamic range limited, causing convolution
artifacts to appear around the compact continuum peak; these artifacts
are not real (see text).

3. Models
Images from radio interferometers combine the information ob-
tained from all baselines (scales) into one image. Thus, analyz-
ing an image of a small-scale structure whose emission con-
stitutes only a fraction of the total is not optimal. Visibilities
provide a better starting point for taking advantage of the full
information of emission on diﬀerent size scales. This way the

large-scale envelope can be disentangled from emission on small
scales. A large-scale, roughly spherical envelope model and
possible companion source(s) are subtracted (and the data de-
projected), then two diﬀerent models are ﬁtted to the residuals
to study the small-scale structure in these ﬁve sources. The two
ﬁtted models are an intensity distribution consisting of a Gaus-
sian plus a point source, and an analytical equation of the visi-
bilities given by a passively heated thin disk. Simple power-law
models to the visibilities without subtracting any large-scale en-
velope components are provided for comparison in Sect. 5.3 for
NGC 1333 IRAS 2A and in the Appendix for the rest of the
sources.

3.1. Envelope model

Class 0 sources are deeply embedded in their surrounding en-
velope whose emission makes a non-negligible contribution to
the total ﬂux. The envelope contribution to the ﬂux falls oﬀ with
decreasing scale probed.

To analyze the smallest scales where the emission deviates
from a smooth symmetric structure, we ﬁrst need to remove the
larger scale envelope contribution. This is done by simulating
observations of model images of already published models for
the envelopes of the studied sources and then subtracting them
from the observations (see Fig. 2 for an example and Appendix A
for all sources). The envelope models are taken to be spherically
symmetric and constrained by a simultaneous ﬁt to the SED and
millimeter continuum radial proﬁles obtained with single-dish
observations, probing scales of thousands of AU (Jørgensen et al.
2002; Kristensen et al. 2012). The most recent models include
far-infrared measurements from Herschel to constrain the peak
of the SED (Karska et al. 2013). The density proﬁle is a power
law given as

where ρin = nin µH2mp and µH2
= 2.8 (H2, H, He, and 2% metals;
Kauﬀmann et al. 2008, Appendix A.1), mp the mass of a proton
and nin the number density at rin, the inner radius of the envelope.
Instead of interpolating the density and temperature to a ﬁner
grid from the published envelope models, a model image of the
envelope was created from scratch for use in simulating the vis-
ibilities appropriate for the resolution of the interferometric ob-
servations. For a best-ﬁt density distribution, we calculate the
dust temperature self-consistently at each radius of the enve-
lope for the observed luminosity using the dust continuum ra-
diative transfer code TRANSPHERE (Dullemond et al. 2002).
The dust density and temperature structure is then input to the
Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RATRAN (Hogerheijde &
van der Tak 2000) to produce the model image of the continuum
(assuming a gas-to-dust ratio of ∆g/d = 100). The opacities are

taken from Ossenkopf & Henning (1994)3. This opacity at 203.4
and 219 GHz is 0.899 cm2g−1 and 2.57 at 335 GHz.

Because the envelope model is subtracted from the observa-
tional data, the center position of the large-scale envelope needs
to be determined. This is assumed to be the continuum peak po-
sition in the interferometric data or, if there are nearby compan-
ions, the center of the large-scale emission of the system. This
large-scale emission is determined from the short u-v distances
and is characterized by a Gaussian, the center of which is as-
sumed to give the center of mass of the large-scale envelope.

The resulting model image from the radiative transfer code is
then input, together with the shifted observed visibility data, to
the GILDAS routine uv_fmodel. The routine simulates obser-
vations of the model image by sampling the same u-v coverage
as the observations. This envelope model is then subtracted from
the observed visibilities. What is left is the contribution to the
ﬂux that cannot be attributed to such a spherical envelope alone,
assuming that the envelope is optically thin.

3.2. Gaussian intensity distribution
As a ﬁrst characterization of the visibilities after envelope sub-
traction, a Gaussian intensity distribution with an unresolved
point source is ﬁtted. The model corresponds to the emission
from an embedded disk where the added unresolved point source
is needed to reproduce the emission on the longest baselines.
Most of the emission (95%) of a Gaussian is emitted within
±1σ ∼ 0.85 × θFWHM. From the ﬁt we can then get an estimate
of the radius of the disk/compact structure, which is taken as
rc = R = 0.42 × θFWHM. Expressing the FWHM (θFWHM) in arc-
seconds and the u-v distance (ruv =
u2 + v2) in wavelengths,
the function to ﬁt a Gaussian intensity distribution with ampli-
tude FG takes the form

Fre(ruv) = Fps + FG exp

(2)

The point source ﬂux (Fps) is simply a constant across all u-v
distances (i.e., Fourier transform of a Dirac delta function at the
origin). This assumes that the structure is circularly symmetric
and the center of mass is at the phase center, so the expected
imaginary amplitude is zero for all baselines.

The gas mass of the structure at a distance d is calculated as

M =

Fν d2

∆g/d,

(3)

where Fν is the ﬂux, Bν(T) the Planck function at frequency ν
and temperature T, κν the opacity at frequency ν, and ∆g/d the
gas-to-dust-ratio. The mass is calculated using the ﬂux of the
Gaussian and point source, i.e., Fps+FG, and assumes an average
temperature of 30 K. This temperature could be lower, which
would increase the mass (e.g., Jørgensen et al. 2009; Dunham
et al. 2014)

3.3. Power-law disk
The Gaussian model described above approximates the intensity
distribution from a disk. Except for an estimate of the radius and
the mass of such a disk, it does not ﬁt any physical structure. It is
possible to calculate the visibilities corresponding to an inclined

circular disk with a power-law density and temperature proﬁle
(Berger & Segransan 2007). Thus, the ﬁt will be sensitive to the
physical conditions provided that such a disk is a good enough
approximation of the physical structure. We note, however, that
ﬁtting observations at only one frequency is essentially a ﬁt of
p + q, i.e., the temperature and density together. To break the
degeneracy, a temperature or density proﬁle needs to be assumed
or constrained by other means.

The model of the disk is at the phase center making the imag-
inary visibilities zero. A vertical disk structure is not included in
the model. The radius of the disk, rc, comes from the Gaussian
ﬁt previously described and the inner radius is set to 0.1 AU.

The temperature in the disk is given by

T(r) = T0

,

(4)

where T0 is taken to be 1500 K at rT0
= 0.1 AU. We assume
q = 0.5 for all modeled disks. This is a reasonable value given
both analytical studies and observations. A model of a radia-
tive, passive circumstellar disk in hydrostatic equilibrium gives
q = 0.5 (Chiang et al. 2001, extended model of Chiang & Gol-
dreich 1997). Observations of more evolved disks (i.e., T Tauri
disks) show 0.4 < q < 0.75 (Andrews & Williams 2005) con-
ﬁrming that q = 0.5 is a reasonable value. This means that the
100 K radius is r100 K = rT0(100/T0)1/−q, i.e., 22.5 AU for the
sources in this study. Such a large value of the water snowline
is consistent with 2D radiative transfer models that explicitly in-
clude the accretional heating due to high mass accretion rates
expected in Class 0 systems (Harsono et al. 2015). The lowest
temperature allowed in the disk is Tmin = 10 K. This is set by the
external radiation ﬁeld which heats the outer envelope to sim-
ilar temperatures. The surrounding envelope at r = 300 AU is
roughly T = 20 − 50 K, given by the envelope models of the
sources (see Sect. 3.1 and Sect. 4.2). A lower disk temperature
compared to the envelope at similar radii could be explained by
the expected shielding of the disk mid-plane. However, q has not
been accurately determined in these systems, and is not neces-
sarily constant with radius (e.g., Whitney et al. 2003a).

tiplied with the opacity κν and divided by the inclination cos i,
i.e., τ(r) = Σ(r)κν/ cos i. The visibility for a given u-v distance of
such a disk can be calculated by integrating thin circular rings,
each with a temperature and optical depth assuming blackbody

to many diﬀerent factors, for example viscous spreading, non-
spherical envelope contribution (i.e., ﬂattened inner envelope),
and other relatively uncertain parameters. The free parameters
in ﬁtting this power-law disk are those for the surface density, p

We note that the taper is excluded in the estimate.

After ﬁtting the power-law disk, it is possible to estimate the
mid-plane density of such a passively heated structure, which is
needed in order to discuss the disk chemistry and for comparison
with the envelope model. We note that we do not ﬁt the vertical
structure. For a passively heated vertically isothermal disk, the
scale height is given as

The density is then calculated for a central source of M(cid:63) =
0.05 M(cid:12) for all sources except VLA 1623 A, where 0.2 M(cid:12) is
used (Murillo et al. 2013b). Thus, the mid-plane density and den-
sity at one scale height are given by

With these assumptions it is possible to look at how the density
transitions to the envelope. Given no evidence of sharp edges
in the visibility curve, the emitting surface should be smooth as
well. The central stellar mass is not well constrained except for
VLA 1623. However, increasing the stellar mass to 0.3 M(cid:12), for
example, instead of the assumed 0.05 M(cid:12) for the relevant sources

3.4. Application of models to data

The analysis of the data is performed on the binned visibilities
alone to avoid an additional uncertainty that the imaging meth-
ods can introduce (i.e., gridding and cleaning). Imaging was
done to conﬁrm phase shifts and companion subtraction. The
size of the visibility bins was taken as the u-v distance corre-
sponding to the individual antenna diameter.

Before ﬁtting any structures to the observations the data are
prepared in a few steps (illustrated for IRAS 4A-SE in Fig. 2 and
in Appendix A for the rest of the sources):

1. A spherically symmetric model of the envelope is con-
structed. The model is subtracted from the observational vis-
ibilities (see Sect. 3.1 for details).

2. A Gaussian and a point source are ﬁtted to all compo-
nents and those corresponding to companion(s) are sub-
tracted from the visibilities. Visual inspection of the residual
image conﬁrms the success of the subtraction.

3. The phase center is shifted so that the continuum peak of
the source of interest is at the center (relevant for companion
systems).

At this point, the visibility data of all sources consist primarily
of emission not reproducible with the spherical envelope models
and free of resolved close companion sources. IRAS 4A-SE/NW
and VLA 1623 A both have nearby companions that are resolved
and need to be subtracted. IRAS 4B has a weak companion at
∼ 10(cid:48)(cid:48) directly east, but due to its weak nature and distance
from the main source it should not contribute any real ﬂux; how-
ever, it was subtracted before analysis. For IRAS 4A, where both
sources have been analyzed and are relatively strong, there is a
risk of left-over structure from the subtracted companion. How-
ever, the spatial scales involved in the ﬁtting are smaller than the
separation, and thus any structure left over should not aﬀect the
results.

The structure remaining after the envelope subtraction is as-
sumed to be ﬂattened and inclined with respect to the plane of
the sky. Since the Gaussian and power-law disk models assume a
face-on viewing angle when calculating the visibilities (circular
Gaussian and face-on disk) the observational data need to be de-
projected to be aligned with the plane of the sky. Since the min-
imization is done on the observations subtracted by the model,
it is easier to de-project the data rather than the model. To de-
project the model more calculation steps need to be performed
to compare it with the observations because they need to be com-
pared in the same u-v coordinates, which change when the visi-
bilities are de-projected (see Appendix B.2). Assuming that the
remaining compact axisymmetric structure is aligned approxi-
mately perpendicular to the large-scale outﬂow, the visibilities
can be de-projected using the best estimates of the position angle
(PA, measured east of north) and inclination. A face-on disk has
an inclination of 0◦ and an edge-on disk 90◦. Subsequently, the
real amplitudes of the visibilities are analyzed, ﬁrst by ﬁtting an
intensity distribution consisting of a circular Gaussian together
with a point source. This provides an estimate of the radius and
a mass of the compact structure. The estimate of the radius is
then used in the ﬁtting of the physical power-law disk model
as the disk radius (rc). The models are ﬁtted to the data using
the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm through the SciPy.optimize
module (Jones et al. 2001).

The de-projection is performed on the visibilities using the
same approach as given in Hughes et al. (2007), some details
are given in Appendix B.2. If there are previous estimates of
the PA and inclination (e.g., from gas tracers showing rotation)
these values are used. Otherwise it is assumed that PAdisk =
PAoutﬂow + 90◦. Furthermore, for all sources except VLA 1623 A
and IRAS 2A, there are no reliable estimates for the inclination
angle, which is then assumed to be 60◦. However, changes in
the inclination of 15◦ are run to assess the eﬀects of inclination
(45◦and 75◦). Current best estimates of the PA and inclination
from literature, where applicable, are listed in Table 3. We note
that inclinations close to edge-on, i.e., 90◦ are not easily con-
strained with this method (lim

4. Results
4.1. Gaussian intensity distribution
The results of ﬁtting a Gaussian intensity distribution plus point
source are shown in Figure 3. The parameters of the best ﬁts are
presented in Table 4. The radius is calculated from 0.42 ×θFWHM.
In ﬁtting a point source it is assumed that the most compact
structure is not resolved. The data of IRAS 2A and IRAS 4A-
SE/-NW are represented well by the ﬁt function. However, for
these sources information on the longest baselines, as available
for VLA 1623 A and IRAS 4B, is missing. Furthermore, the

data for IRAS 4A-NW/-SE have a lower signal-to-noise ratio.
IRAS 4B has a jump in real amplitude around 280 kλ; the reason
for this is unclear. Toward the longest baselines, the IRAS 4B
amplitude seems to go below zero, signifying that perhaps the
compact structure has a sharp edge or that the center of mass is
slightly oﬀset from the phase center; longer baseline data could
shed light on this. For VLA 1623 A, the non-zero values out
to long u-v distances show that a compact structure is probably
present. The Gaussian plus point source ﬁt is worse in the range
70 ∼ 250 kλ for VLA 1623 A.

4.2. Power-law disk

The resulting best-ﬁt power-law disk model to the envelope sub-
tracted and de-projected real visibility amplitude curves for each
source are presented in Figure 4. The best-ﬁt parameters are
summarized in Table 5. For rc, the best-ﬁt value from the Gaus-
sian ﬁt is taken. We note that the power-law disk ﬁts the temper-
ature multiplied with the density, i.e., p + q, with q ﬁxed to 0.5
before ﬁtting Σ and p. The density fall-oﬀ in the taper is signiﬁ-
cantly steeper and this is reﬂected in the increase in intensity in
the visibilities. The values for the density power-law index, p is

Article number, page 6 of 16

similar for all sources (∼ 1) except IRAS 4B. The gas surface
density varies between 2.4 and 51 g cm−2 at r0 = 50 AU.

IRAS 2A and IRAS 4A-NW/-SE are well represented with
the disk model, with similar constraints on the disk parameters.
The ﬁt is worse in the range 70 ∼ 200 kλ for VLA 1623 A and
IRAS 4B. This is partly because of the addition of a taper, whose
radial density decrease depends on the disk density (i.e., 2 − p).
While not ideal, it should not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the
estimated disk parameters and the subsequent discussion on the
derived physical conditions.

The corresponding best-ﬁt density and temperature as a func-
tion of radius for each source are shown in Figures 5 and 6. The
largest jump in density between the disk and envelope is seen
in IRAS 4B where the interface between them is not smooth.
The disk derived for IRAS 4B is small and has a shallow density
proﬁle. As noted, the vertical disk structure is not ﬁtted in this
study, so the mid-plane disk density connects with the envelope
through the taper. The continuum τ = 1 radius at 1.5 mm lies
within R ∼ 10 AU for all sources and will not aﬀect our results
for the larger scales.

The midplane temperature proﬁle does not align well with
the envelope for IRAS 2A (Fig. 6), but does merge smoothly for
the other sources. Disk shadowing will aﬀect both temperature
and density, for example, lowering the temperature just behind
the disk, which could explain the jump in temperature and den-
sity in some of the disk-envelope interfaces shown here (e.g.,
Murillo et al. 2015). It is important to note again here that the
midplane gas volume density is derived using a combination of
ﬁtted and ﬁxed parameters and it should be kept in mind when in-
terpreting the results. The midplane density depends on the scale
height, which is a function of the temperature proﬁle (which is
ﬁxed, see Sect. 3.3).

5. Discussion
In this study, the de-projected continuum interferometric visi-
bilities of ﬁve deeply embedded low-mass protostars are ﬁtted
with two diﬀerent models, a Gaussian disk intensity distribution
and a parametrized analytical expression of a vertically isother-
mal thin disk model. Before ﬁtting the disk models, the current
best model of the surrounding large-scale envelope and possible
companion sources were subtracted.

5.1. Method uncertainties
There are various uncertainties related to the analysis which
should be re-iterated before an in-depth discussion of the results.
The analyzed envelope subtracted residual visibilities de-
pend on the envelope model used. The most recent models by

Kristensen et al. (2012) and Jørgensen et al. (2002) are used to
minimize this source of uncertainty. The models use both the
observed SED and radial proﬁle of the millimeter emission to
constrain the envelope density and temperature proﬁle.

The disk mass estimate, Equation (3), assumes an average
temperature of the disk, which is the same for all sources. For
simple cases this should be a good enough approximation, and
facilitates easy comparison with results from other studies of the
same or similar sources where the same method was used.

The assumed stellar mass and temperature proﬁle of the
power-law disk will aﬀect the derived midplane density, and to
some extent the surface density proﬁle (i.e., p) given the degen-
eracies of calculating the visibilities (i.e., p + q is ﬁtted). The ef-
fect of the stellar mass on the derived midplane density is small.
The assumed temperature proﬁle also aﬀects the midplane den-

sity, in the opposite way from mass. Increasing both the stellar
mass and disk temperature by a factor of two will not have any
eﬀect on the derived midplane density. However, the assumed
temperature proﬁle has an impact on the amount of material
above 100 K and thus the derived molecular abundances. As dis-
cussed in Sect. 3.3 we have assumed a temperature proﬁle that
is reasonable and in agreement with other studies. Future higher
sensitivity and higher resolution observations of molecular lines
sensitive to the temperature structure can potentially improve the
constraints.

5.2. Disk radii and masses
The derived range of radii of the disk-like structures, 90 −
170 AU, are plausible and are marginally resolved in these data

sets. The disk diameter (2×rc) corresponds to the scale where
there is a sharp increase in ﬂux.

For the one source, VLA 1623 A, for which the radius of the
Keplerian disk has been determined from kinematics of C18O
line emission, a value of R = 150 AU (rotationally supported
to R = 180 AU) has been found by Murillo et al. (2013b). The
radius derived in this study is rc = 100+44−20 AU, which is some-
what smaller but in agreement within the uncertainties. In more
mature disks, the mm dust continuum has been found to be more
centrally concentrated than the gas due to radial drift (e.g., An-
drews et al. 2012). This could be happening in VLA 1623 even
at this early stage.

The inferred masses vary between the sources, and are dif-
ferent depending on the method. The mass estimates using the
Gaussian intensity distribution are generally higher (54 − 556 ×

V. Persson et al.: Constraining the physical structure of the inner few 100 AU scales of deeply embedded low-mass protostars.

uum observations of IRAS 2A covering baselines between 18
and 164 kλ. They found a radius of this compact emission of
100 − 200 AU and a mass of 0.1 M(cid:12) (for Tavg = 30 K and ﬂux
of u-v dist > 50 kλ). Our disk radius and mass derived from the
Gaussian intensity distribution agree with this estimate.

In IRAS 4B the relatively high mass derived with the power-
law disk shows a small disk with a ﬂat density distribution and a
high surface density. Choi & Lee (2011) argue from the extent of
the 1.3 cm continuum emission toward IRAS 4B that the radius
of the compact disk-like structure is R = 25 AU, roughly 1/3
of the disk size derived here. Larger grains, similar to those re-
sponsible for the emission at these wavelengths, are aﬀected by
radial drift to a higher extent (e.g., Birnstiel et al. 2010), and the
cm emission is thus expected to be more compact, in agreement
with these results. However, Choi et al. (2010) derived a radius
of at least 220 AU from kinematic analysis of ammonia emission
at 24 GHz (1.3 cm).
Jørgensen et al. (2009) estimated the mass of the compact
components toward IRAS 2A (56 × 10−3 M(cid:12)), IRAS 4A-SE
(460×10−3 M(cid:12)) and IRAS 4B (240×10−3 M(cid:12)). This was done by
using a combination of the interferometric ﬂux on 50 kλ scales
and single-dish ﬂux at 850 µm. The masses derived from the
power-law disk in this study agree for IRAS 2A and within a
factor of 2 for IRAS 4B, but the disk mass derived for IRAS 4A-
SE is ﬁve times lower. The gas masses derived from the Gaussian
intensity distribution are about a factor of 2-3 higher than that of
Jørgensen et al. for IRAS 2A and IRAS 4B, but for IRAS 4A-
SE it is roughly half. The generally higher masses derived using
the Gaussian intensity distribution comes from the fact that Jør-
gensen et al. uses the ﬂux at 50 kλ to derive the disk mass and
a steeper power-law envelope proﬁle; Fig. 3 shows that this ﬂux
is still not the total ﬂux of the compact component left after sub-
tracting the spherically symmetric envelope contribution.

The ﬁtted density power laws show that there is a signiﬁcant
amount of material at large radii. This is important for fragmen-
tation. Numerical studies have shown that if the ratio of disk to
stellar mass (Mdisk/M∗) goes above ∼ 0.25 the disk can be prone
to gravitational instabilities (e.g., Lodato & Rice 2004; Dong
et al. 2015). It has been suggested that any gravitational insta-
bilities may induce the formation of multiple star systems (e.g.,
Kratter et al. 2010). These instabilities can only form in disks
more massive than in the Class II stage (i.e., higher Mdisk/M∗),
thus more likely in the earlier protostellar stages when the stel-
lar mass is still low. Given that about half of all solar analogs
are found in multiple systems (Raghavan et al. 2010), determin-
ing the physical conditions in the early stages of disk formation
is of great importance for the understanding of the formation
of multiple star and planetary systems. For VLA 1623, where
the stellar mass was determined previously, the Mdisk/M∗ ratio
is 0.009/0.20 = 0.045, indicating a gravitationally stable disk.
All the other sources have values higher than Mdisk/M∗ = 0.25,
assuming M∗ = 0.05. With M∗ = 0.2 as for VLA 1623, the disks
have ratios close to or higher than 0.25, indicating that the disks
may be gravitationally unstable even in this scenario.

For all sources, the envelope is relatively well characterized
on large scales, since both radial proﬁles and the SED were
used to model the large-scale envelope. It is not clear whether
the added taper, which is frequently used in similar studies for
more evolved disks (i.e., Class II disks) (Andrews & Williams
2008), is a good representation of the disk-to-envelope interface
for these sources. However, it is also important to characterize
this interface region that is not ﬁtted by spherical envelope mod-
els. For some of the sources in the study there are no observa-

tions with longer baseline coverage, thus adding degeneracy to
the ﬁtting

It is clear from the various data sets used here that it is impor-
tant to cover longer u-v distances to constrain the disk. Of all the
observations, only the ALMA data on VLA 1623 A cover base-
lines that fully resolve the disk-like structure, the observations
of the other sources should still be sensitive to the structure but
to a less extent. For more robust models of the radial structure,
higher resolution observations are needed.

5.3. Envelope-only model

Recently, Maury et al. (2014) ﬁtted the 1.3 mm continuum visi-
bility amplitudes of IRAS 2A obtained with PdBI (baselines 14
to 557 kλ, 8(cid:48)(cid:48)-0(cid:48)(cid:48).35) with a power-law intensity distribution, rep-
resenting a single spherical envelope. The intensity as a function
of u-v distance for an envelope with T ∝ r−q and ρ ∝ r−p is
V ∝ ba, where a = (p + q − 3). To compare to these results, such
a power-law envelope was ﬁtted to the visibilities of IRAS 2A
in this study. It is important to note that the two companions that
Maury et al. subtract prior to envelope-ﬁtting do not exist in our
data (see Sect. 2 for references), so we do not subtract any com-
panion sources for this analysis.

Maury et al. would be 2.55 − 2.0 = 0.55. The resulting temper-
ature proﬁle from TRANSPHERE is roughly approximated by
q = 0.5. This shows that the modiﬁed model of the envelope is
consistent with that of Maury et al. on these aspects.

Fig. 8. Modiﬁed envelope-only models from Kristensen et al. (2012)
in comparison to the observed interferometric visibilities of IRAS 2A.
The non-modiﬁed model of Kristensen et al. is shown as a black line;
the by eye best-ﬁtting modiﬁed model, with 5× higher number density
(nin) at the inner radius and p = −2.0 is shown in purple.

The observed ﬂux at 219 GHz given by Maury et al. (2014)
(scaled from Motte & André 2001), is 0.86 Jy. The total ﬂux at
219 GHz after convolving with the 11(cid:48)(cid:48) beam is 1.02 Jy for the
Kristensen et al. model and 1.25 Jy for the modiﬁed interfero-
metric model. Given a typical absolute ﬂux uncertainty in single-
dish observations of about 20%, the modiﬁed model is higher by
45%, while the Kristensen et al. model is higher by 19%. The
modiﬁed model is higher by a signiﬁcant amount, although not
enough to discard it. Thus the modiﬁed single power-law enve-
lope can reproduce the interferometric visibilities and almost the
total ﬂux.

Fig. 7. IRAS 2A envelope power-law model, V = Cba, applied to the
IRAS 2A data without subtraction of our envelope model. Here a =
−0.78 ± 0.03, C = 3.2 ± 0.4, and b is in units of kλ.

The resulting power-law envelope ﬁt is shown in Fig. 7, and
the ﬁt coeﬃcients are a = −0.78 ± 0.03 (V = Cba, where
C = 3.2 ± 0.4 if b is in kλ). This implies p + q = 2.22, and
for comparison, Maury et al. presented a = −0.45 ± 0.05, i.e.,
p + q = 2.55. The envelope-only power-law ﬁts for the rest of
the sources in this study are presented in Appendix C and Ta-
ble C.1.

While the modiﬁed power-law envelope model can repro-
duce the interferometric visibilities, it does not mean that the
entire envelope is reproduced with this model alone. Modify-
ing the envelope model by Kristensen et al. to ﬁt the visibility
amplitudes gives the results shown in Fig. 8. The model that
best reproduces the interferometric visibility amplitude is where
the volume number density is increased by a factor of 5 from
4.9 × 108 to 25 × 108 cm−3 and the power law steepened from
p = −1.7 to −2.0. This essentially represents moving more of
the mass inward to accommodate the ﬂux on longer baselines,
i.e., smaller scales. The wiggles at large baselines are due to the
sharp edge introduced at the inner radius.

With this modiﬁed model the analytical prediction of the
temperature slope (q) from the single powerlaw envelope ﬁt of

The envelope models of Kristensen et al. and Jørgensen et al.
(2002) are not only constrained by the total ﬂux (SED), but also
by the radial proﬁle of the large-scale emission. The radial pro-
ﬁles of the two envelope models are shown in Fig. 9 together
with observations at 850 µm for IRAS 2A.
While the model of Kristensen et al. ﬁts the radial proﬁle,
on scales larger than about 20(cid:48)(cid:48) the modiﬁed model is at least 5
times lower than the observations. This is not surprising since

much of the mass has been moved inward to ﬁt the compact
component of the emission. Thus, the single power-law envelope
cannot reproduce the interferometric visibilities and the large-
scale emission at the same time. Additionally, the morphology
of IRAS 2A shows non-circular symmetric structures already at
scales of 2(cid:48)(cid:48) in 1.3mm observations (Tobin et al. 2015b), demon-
strating that simply modifying the inner radial density distribu-
tion of the power-law envelope is not enough. Thus, a compact
structure, possibly disk-like, together with an extended envelope
provides the best ﬁt to the total observed emission.

5.4. Mass above 100 K
The percentage of the material that is above 100 K for each ra-
dius of the disk is computed based on the best-ﬁt power-law disk
model. Figure 10 presents the mass enclosed for each radius
compared with the mass where T ≥ 100 K. The radius where
T = 100 K is the same for all sources, given the assumption
that q = 0.5 and a ﬁxed rT0 (eﬀectively ﬁxed L∗). The diﬀer-
ent sizes and densities of the disk then change the percentage
of the warm material at a certain radius. The ∼ 20% limit lies
between 50 ∼ 150 AU for the sources except for VLA 1623 A,
which never goes below 30%. In Table 5 the percentage at the
disk radius (rc) is listed for the studied sources. The percentage
can be relatively large, up to 30% (VLA 1623 A) and as low as
7% (IRAS 4A-SE). Changing the temperature structure such that
the 100 K radius is at 5 AU but leaving everything else the same
lowers the percentage to 9% for VLA 1623 A and to 0.5% for
IRAS 4A-SE.

dust temperatures above ∼ 100 K is particularly important since
this is the temperature above which water ice sublimates and any
complex molecules locked into the ice are released (Fraser et al.
2001) (the speciﬁc temperature depends on density, see Harsono
et al. 2015).

Persson et al. (2012) estimate gas phase water abundances to
total (cold+warm) H2 densities for four of the sources observed
in this study by using masses derived by Jørgensen et al. (2009)
from the 850 µm continuum in the same beam. In Fig. 11 these
values, and new estimates derived using the masses from this
study are shown. The largest diﬀerence is seen for IRAS 4B and
the upper limit of IRAS 4A-SE. With the new total disk/compact
masses the warm-water abundance is slightly diﬀerent. However,
it is expected that the whole structure will not have temperatures
above 100 K, thus the fractional abundance using the total mass
inferred from the power-law and Gaussian disk can be seen as a
lower limit to the relative gas phase abundance of water.

Correcting for the amount of material in the disk above
100 K increases the fractional abundances with up to almost
two orders of magnitude. However, as shown by Harsono et al.
(2015), part of the warm water emission could originate in the
envelope surrounding the disk, i.e., the hot corino, thus making
the fractional abundances for T > 100 K material upper lim-
its. This part of the model is not captured in the modeling of
the disk, which focuses on the cold dense region. We note that
the power-law disk model does not include any vertical struc-
ture. A temperature gradient along the vertical direction of the
disk could increase the amount of warm gas (T > 100 K), thus
decreasing the abundance of gas phase water.

Given the models used in this study, correcting for the mate-
rial with T > 100 K gives relative water abundances as high as
6.2 × 10−5 for IRAS 2A, comparable to what is expected from
sublimated ices (10−4). For the rest of the sources studied, the
same abundances are lower by 1 ∼ 3 orders of magnitude from
this high value in IRAS 2A. The disk in IRAS 4B is compact and
dense (ﬂat proﬁle and high surface density), this causes the very
low relative abundance of water. The envelope power-law is also
ﬂatter than the other sources. These results show that disks are
not as dry as previously stated, but are not “wet” either.

6. Summary and outlook
The deeply embedded nature of Class 0 sources adds to the
diﬃculty of determining the physical structure on small, sub-
300 AU, scales. Several parameters need to be determined. On
small scales, a thin-disk model can approximate the emission
and make it possible to constrain the radial density proﬁle, as-
suming a ﬁxed temperature distribution. For the ﬁve Class 0
sources studied here, the derived disk radii are similar (90 −
170 AU), and masses from ﬁtting a power-law disk range from
9 − 140 × 10−3 M(cid:12). Most of the derived power-law disk masses
agree with previous estimates using other methods. The gas sur-
face density varies between 2.4−51 g cm−2 (at r0 = 50 AU). The
temperature and density proﬁles have a smooth transition to the
envelope in general.

The inferred disk/compact masses are high, comparable to
or higher than the assumed stellar mass of 0.05 M(cid:12). VLA 1623
is the only source in this study where a stellar mass of 0.2 M(cid:12)
has been determined. The ratio between the disk and stellar mass
determines when disk instabilities may develop. At ratios higher
than 0.25 the disk becomes prone to gravitational instabilities
(e.g., Lodato & Rice 2004; Dong et al. 2015), which would apply
to most of our disks up to M∗ ≈ 0.3M(cid:12).
The fractional amount of material above 100 K in the whole
disk varies between 9− 30 %, with an assumed temperature pro-
ﬁle of q = 0.5 (see Sect. 3.3 for choice of q). A lower q would
increase the percentages, and a higher q decrease. The main as-
sumption is that the compact structure is indeed a disk that can
be described with this power-law model. Using previous obser-
vations of p-H18
2 O, we estimate relative gas phase water abun-
dances to total H2 densities and for H2 warmer than 100 K. The
relative water abundance in the warm gas (>100 K) of these disks
are 6.2×10−5 (IRAS 2A), 0.33×10−5 (IRAS 4A-NW), 1.8×10−8
(IRAS 4B), and < 2 × 10−8 (IRAS 4A-SE). Thus, the gas-phase
water abundance can be as high as the expected value for subli-
mated ice of 10−4 (as in IRAS 2A), but are lower for the other
sources studied.

The techniques developed here can be applied to large sam-
ples of sources. The next step is to image both the continuum and
molecular line tracers at higher angular resolution with ALMA
and with good uv coverage on all scales to constrain any disk-like
structure as well as the transition to the larger scale envelope.

panion subtracted data are shown. For VLA 1623 A the com-
panion subtraction makes a clear diﬀerence, which can be seen
even in the visibilities.

Appendix B: Working with visibilities
Appendix B.1: Binning visibilities - vector averaging
The visibilities are binned in annuli around the origin of the u-v
plane. In the following equations, Np is the number of points in
the bin, rei the real part of each visibility, and Re the binned real
amplitude in each bin; the same notation holds for imi and Im:

The combined amplitude is simply the square root of the
√
sum of the squared real and imaginary amplitudes (i.e., A =
Re2 + Im2), the standard deviation is then the error propaga-
tion of the individual errors of the real and imaginary parts.

Appendix B.2: Rotation and inclination
Each u and v coordinate is rotated PA degrees and inclined i de-
grees. This is accomplished by ﬁrst calculating the u-v distances
from the origin

ruv =
(B.4)
and the angle of the new point by subtracting the position angle
from the current direction of the point (measured east of north):

u2 + v2

Calculating the rotated and inclined (along the rotated u-axis)
coordinate system, we get new u and v coordinates
u(cid:48) = ruv sin γ cos i
v(cid:48) = ruv sin γ

with the new u-v distance naturally given by r(cid:48)

uv =

√
u(cid:48)2 + v(cid:48)2.

Appendix C: Envelope-only results
This section presents the results of the envelope-only ﬁtting of
the interferometric visibilities. As shown in Section 5, these
models do not necessarily ﬁt the large-scale emission. For
IRAS 4A-SE two ﬁts were performed, one including all visi-
bilities and one with only visibilties with u-v distances shorter
than 150 kλ to minimize interference from the binary source.

Fig. A.1. Images and visibilities of data preparation steps for IRAS 2A. From left to right: raw data, envelope model, raw data with envelope
subtracted. The images start at 3σ, in steps of 3σ until 9σ where it is in steps of 9σ, σ=1.6 mJy (σ=0.2 mJy for envelope model image).

Fig. A.2. Images and visibilities of data preparation steps for IRAS 4B. From left to right: raw data, envelope model, raw data with envelope
subtracted. The images start at 3σ, in steps of 3σ until 15σ where it is in steps of 15σ, σ=2 mJy (σ=0.13 mJy for envelope model image). As
pointed out in the text, the observations of IRAS 4B are dynamic range limited, which causes the compact emission around the main continuum
peak seen in the images above; these are convolution artifacts and are not real.
