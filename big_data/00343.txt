Abstract

A Hamilton-Poisson system is an approach for the motion of a spacecraft around
an asteroid or for the motion of an underwater vehicle. We construct a coordinate
chart on the symplectic leaf which contains a speciﬁc generic equilibrium point and
we establish stability conditions for this equilibrium point.

Introduction

The problem of stability of spacecrafts and underwater vehicles attracted numerous
resources and led to the emergence of a signiﬁcant number of theoretical studies.

In this paper we consider an idealized dynamics of spacecrafts and underwater vehicles
which is a Hamilton-Poisson system. For a spacecraft we consider the dynamics presented
in [12] and for an underwater vehicle we work with the dynamics considered in [9].
Speciﬁc Casimir functions of these situations allow description of the symplectic leaves
containing some equilibrium points by using the rotation matrices. We construct a
coordinate chart on a symplectic leaf speciﬁed above by means of the double covering
map between the 3-sphere S3 and the special orthogonal group SO(3). The expression
of Hamilton function by using this coordinate chart lead us to some stability results for
particular states of spacecrafts and underwater vehicles. To decide the stability we use
the algebraic method presented in [5]. Alternative methods are Arnold method (see [1])
or equivalent methods as Casimir method and Ortega-Ratiu method (see [4]).

In the second section we present stability results of some generic equilibrium points
of a spacecraft moving around an asteroid. We ﬁnd the suﬃcient conditions for stability
from the paper [12]. Our method reduces to the study of the eigenvalues of a 6 × 6
matrix while paper [12] work with a 12 × 12 matrix.

In Section 3 we study the stability of some generic equilibrium points of an underwater
vehicle. We consider a more general situation than studied in papers [8], [9], [10], [11]; we
suppose that the third axis is a principal axis of inertia for the vehicle but the ﬁrst and
second axes of the vehicle-ﬁxed frame may not be principal axes of inertia for the vehicle.
We prove that the conditions for the stability of an equilibrium point does not depend
on the position of the ﬁrst and second axes of inertia of the vehicle in the perpendicular
plane on the third axis of the vehicle-ﬁxed frame.

2 Stability of a spacecraft moving around an aster-

oid

We consider a rigid spacecraft moving on a stationary orbit around a rigid asteroid. The
ﬁxed-body frame of the asteroid (O, u, v, w) has the origin in the mass center and the
axes are principal axes of inertia of the asteroid. According to the hypotheses made in
the paper [12], we assume that the mass center of the asteroid is stationary in an inertial
frame, the asteroid has an uniform rotation around its maximum-moment principal axis,
the spacecraft is on a stationary orbit, and the orbital motion is not aﬀected by the
attitude motion.

The ﬁxed-body frame of the spacecraft (C, i, j, k) has the origin C in the mass center
and the axes are principal axes of inertia of the spacecraft. ”A stationary orbit in the
inertial frame corresponds to an equilibrium in the ﬁxed-body frame of the asteroid; there
are two kinds of stationary orbits: those that lie on the intermediate moment principal
axis of the asteroid, and those that lie on the minimum-moment principal axis of the
asteroid” (see [12]).

The attitude of the spacecraft is desribed by the vectors α, β, γ, where γ is the
versor with the origin in the mass center of the spacecraft towards the mass center of
the asteroid, β is the versor in the opposite direction of the orbital angular momentul,
and α = β × γ. We denote by Π the angular momentum of the spacecraft with respect
to the inertial frame and z = (Π, α, β, γ).

According to the paper [12], the system of motion can be written as

˙z = Λ(z)∇H(z);

The Hamiltonian function is given by

H(z) =

< Π, I−1Π > +ωT < Π, β > +V (α, β, γ), I

(2.1)

(2.2)

where ωT is the angular velocity of the uniform rotation of the asteroid, I is the inertia
tensor of the spacecraft and its matrix in the ﬁxed-body frame is diag(I1, I2, I3). The
function V represents the perturbation due to the gravity gradient torque and it has the
expression:

V (α, β, γ) = k1 < α, Iα > +k2 < β, Iβ > +k3 < γ, Iγ >,

where k1, k2 and k3 are constants. The Poisson tensor is given by

(cid:98)γ

(cid:98)β O3 O3 O3

 .II

Λ(z) =

The Casimir functions are C11(z) = ||α||2, C12(z) =< α, β >, C13(z) =< α, γ >,
C22(z) = ||β||2 where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ 3 and we denote by C : R12 → R6 the vectorial
Casimir function. We have seven conserved quantities H, C11, C12, C13, C22, C23, C33 of
the dynamics generated by (2.1).

We observe that we have the following equilibrium point ze:
Πe = −ωT I2j, αe = i, βe = j, γe = k.

(2.3)

According to [3], it is a generic equilibrium point because it is a regular point of C; i.e.
rank∇C(ze) = 6.

For our study we construct a coordinate chart on the symplectic leaf C−1(C(ze))

around the equilibrium point ze. We consider the open subset:

ze = {z = (Π, α, β, γ) ∈ C−1(C(ze))| sgn < α, β × γ >= sgn < αe, βe × γe >}III

and we observe that ze ∈ C+
ze.
Lemma 2.1. The function Fze : SE(3) → C+
is a homeomorphism and we have Fze(Πe, I3) = ze. IV

IVWe use the special orthogonal group and the special Euclidean group,

SO(3) = {X ∈ M3(R)| XX T = X T X = I3, det(X) = 1}, SE(3) := R3 (cid:111) SO(3).

M3(R) is a normed space by using the Frobenius norm ||X||F =(cid:112)Trace(X T X).

Proof. If R ∈ SO(3) and u, v ∈ R3 then we have < Ru, Rv >=< u, v > and conse-
quently (Π, Rαe, Rβe, Rγe) ∈ C−1(C(ze)). Also, we have

< Rαe, Rβe × Rγe >=< Rαe, R(βe × γe) >=< αe, βe × γe >

Let (Π, α, β, γ) ∈ C+

which implies that (Π, Rαe, Rβe, Rγe) ∈ C+
ze.
ze. The sets {α, β, γ} and {αe, βe, γe} are orthonormal bases
in R3 with the same orientation and consequently, there exists R ∈ SO(3) such that
(α, β, γ) = (Rαe, Rβe, Rγe). We have the surjectivity.
If Fze(Π, R) = Fze( ˜Π, ˜R), then we have Π = ˜Π, RT ˜Rαe = αe, RT ˜Rβe = βe,
and RT ˜Rγe = γe. Because {αe, βe, γe} is a base of R3 we have that RT ˜R = I3 and
consequently R = ˜R. We have the injectivity.

We construct a double covering map between R3 × S3 and SE(3), where

S3 = {q := (q0, q1, q2, q3) ∈ R4 | q2

1 + q2
is the 3-sphere. For q ∈ S3 we consider the rotation matrix:

The function P : S3 → SO(3), P(q) = Rq is a smooth double covering map.V For
q ∈ S3 we have Rq = R−q and I3 = R(1,0) = R(−1,0). We construct the double covering

map (cid:101)P : R3 × S3 → SE(3) given by (cid:101)P(Π, q) = (Π, P(q)), which has the property
(cid:101)P(Πe, (1, 0)) = (Πe, I3).
R3 × S3 we have the following homeomorphism G(Π, p) = (Π, ((cid:112)1 − ||p||2, p)). It has
+ := R3×{q = (q0, q1, q2, q3) ∈ S3 | q0 > 0} ⊂

Between R3× B3(0, 1) ⊂ R6 and R3× S3

the property G(Πe, 0) = (Πe, (1, 0)).

The above considerations lead to the following result.
Proposition 2.2. There exists an open subset U ⊂ C+
and the set U with the function (Fze ◦ ˜P ◦ G)−1 : U → V ⊂ R6 is a coordinate chart.

ze ⊂ C−1(C(ze)) such that ze ∈ U

We have the following stability result.

Theorem 2.3. Let ze be the equilibrium point described by (2.3). If the point (Πe, 0) is
a strict local extremum of Hze, then the equilibrium point ze is Lyapunov stable.

V For R ∈ SO(3) there exists two distinct points q1, q2 ∈ S3 such that P(q1) = P(q2) = R. P is a
continuous surjective function with the following property: for all R ∈ SO(3) there exists UR an open
neighborhood of R (evenly-covered neighborhood) such that P−1(UR) is a union of two disjoint open
sets in S3 (sheets over UR), each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto UR by P.

Proof. We use the algebraic method, presented in the paper [5] and used in the papers
[6], [7] and [2]. If (Πe, 0) is a strict local extremum of Hze, then the algebraic system

H(z) = H(ze), Cij(z) = Cij(ze), 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ 3

(2.4)

has no root besides ze in some neighborhood of ze. Consequently, the equilibrium point
is Lyapunov stable .

An immediate consequence is the following result.

Theorem 2.4. Let ze be the equilibrium point due by (2.3). If (Πe, 0) is a stationary
point for Hze and the Hessian matrix Hess Hze(Πe, 0) is positive or negative deﬁnite,
then the equilibrium point ze is Lyapunov stable.

We can announce the main result of this section.

Theorem 2.5. A suﬃcient condition for the Lyapunov stability of the equilibrium point
(2.3) is:

(I3 − I1)(k1 − k3) > 0;

and (I2 − I1)(ω2
and (I2 − I3)(ω2

T − 2(k2 − k1)) > 0;
T − 2(k2 − k3)) > 0.

Remark 2.1. The analysis of the above inequalities leads us to the following suﬃcient
conditions for the stability of the equilibrium point (2.3).

(2.6)

If we use the above expressions of the coeﬃcient k1, k2 and k3, then the conditions
(56a), (56b), and (56c) from the paper [12] coincide with the inequalities from Theorem
2.5. In the paper [12] is used a modiﬁed energy-Casimir method in order to ﬁnd the
cited conditions. This method work with the eigenvalues of a 12 × 12 matrix.

For a speciﬁc asteroid the coeﬃcients M, ae, ωT , C20 and C22 are speciﬁed. The har-

monic coeﬃcients C20 and C22 are calculated by the formulas:

C20 = − 1

where I A
w are the principal moments of the asteroid which are calculated in
the mass center of the asteroid. The numbers of the positive solutions of the equation
(2.5) can be characterized by the parameters of the asteroid. The equation can have two
positive solutions, one positive solution or no positive solutions. If we ﬁx a radius of the
stationary orbit around a speciﬁc asteroid, then we obtain ﬁxed values of the coeﬃcients
k1, k2 and k3.

The stability of a spacecraft moving around the asteroid 4769 Castalia.
According to [13] the asteroid 4769 Castalia has the following physical data: M = 1.4091·
1012 kg, ae = 543.1 m, ωT = 4.2882·10−4 s−1, C20 = −7.257·10−2, C22 = 2.984·10−2. The
universal constant has the value G = 6.67384 · 10−11 m3kg−1s−1. The equation (2.5) has
two positive solutions: RS1 = 219.31 m and RS2 = 778.39 m. Because RS1 < ae we can
not have a stationary orbit with the radius RS1. For a stationary orbit with the radius
T > 2(k2 − k1) and, consequently a suﬃcient condition for the
RS2 we have k1 < k3, ω2
stability of (2.3) is that the inertia moments of the spacecraft satisﬁes the inequalities
I2 > I1 > I3.

3 Stability of an underwater vehicle

Following [9], the dynamics for a six degree-of-freedom vehicle modeled as a neutrally
buoyant, submerged rigid body in an inﬁnitely large volume of irrotational, incompress-
ible, inviscid ﬂuid that is at rest at inﬁnity is described by the system

 ˙Π = Π × Ω + Q × v − mglΓ × r

˙Q = Q × Ω
˙Γ = Γ × Ω,

(3.1)

(3.3)

(3.4)

where Π is the angular impulse, Q is the linear impulse, Γ is the direction of gravity, lr
is the vector from center of buoyancy to the center of gravity (with l ≥ 0 and r an unit
vector), m is the mass of the vehicle, g is gravitational acceleration, Ω and v are the
angular and translational velocity of the vehicle. In a body-ﬁxed frame with the origin
in the centre of buoyancy the relationship between (Π, Q) and (Ω, v) is given by

(3.2)

where J is the matrix that is the sum of the body inertia matrix plus the added inertia
matrix associated with the potential ﬂow model of the ﬂuid, M is the sum of the mass
matrix for the body alone, and D accounts for the cross terms. According to [8] we have

M = mI3 + Θf

11, J = Jb + Θf

11, D = ml(cid:98)r + Θf

21.

We denote by I3 the identity matrix and by Jb is the inertia matrix of the vehicle. The

The system (3.1) has the Hamilton-Poisson form (see [8])

where u = (Π, Q, Γ), Λ(u) =

˙u = Λ(u)∇H(u),

 (cid:98)Π (cid:98)Q (cid:98)Γ

(3.6)

by

H(u) =

In this case the Casimir functions are C11(u) = ||Q||2, C12(u) =< Q, Γ > and C22(u) =
||Γ||2 and we denote by C : R9 → R3 the vectorial Casimir function.

We are interested in a generic equilibrium point ue = (Πe, Qe, Γe) which satisfy

Qe (cid:54)= 0, Γe (cid:54)= 0, < Qe, Γe >= 0.

(3.7)

This equilibria has the following properties:
(i) The equilibrium point has no spin. Because ue is a generic equilibrium point we have

Ωe = AΠe + BT Qe =

∂H
∂Π

(ue) = 0.

(ii) The translational velocity is ve = BΠe + CQe.
(iii) The vector r is located in the plane generated by the vectors Qe and Γe (we have
< Qe × Γe, r >= 0).
Remark 3.1. In the paper [3] is presented a stability study for a nongeneric equilibria of
the system (3.1) which is situated to singular symplectic leaves that are not characterized
as a preimage o a regular value of the Casimir functions.

For an equilibrium point ue of our type we construct a coordinate chart on the regular
symplectic leaf C−1(C(ue)) around the equilibrium point using the same scheme as in
the previous section. The open subset C+

ue ⊂ C−1(C(ue)) deﬁned by:

ue = {u = (x, y1, y2) ∈ C−1(C(ue))| y1 × y2 and ye
C+

1 × ye
contains the equilibrium point ue. Between SE(3) and C+

2 have the same orientation}

ue we have the homeomorphism

Fue(Π, R) := (Π, RQe, RΓe)

with the property Fue(Πe, I3) := ue. By using the notations of the previous section we
have the following result.
Proposition 3.1. There exists an open subset U ⊂ C+
and U with function (Fue ◦ ˜P ◦ G)−1 : U → V ⊂ R6 is a coordinate chart.

ue ⊂ C−1(C(ue)) such that ue ∈ U

The Hamiltonian function written in the coordinates of the chart deﬁned in the above

proposition is:

√
Hue(Π, p) = H(Π, R(

1−||p||2,p)Qe, R(

√
1−||p||2,p)Γe).

Analogously with the proofs of Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3 we obtain the following

stability results.

Theorem 3.2. Let ue be a generic equilibrium point satisfying conditions (3.7). If the
point (Πe, 0) is a strict local extremum of Hue, then the equilibrium point ue is Lyapunov
stable.

Theorem 3.3. Let ue be a generic equilibrium point satisfying conditions (3.7).
If
(Πe, 0) is a stationary point for Hue and the Hessian matrix Hess Hue(Πe, 0) is positive
or negative deﬁnite, then the equilibrium point is Lyapunov stable.

3.1 Stability for an ellipsoidal bottom-heavy underwater vehi-

cle

In this section we suppose that the vehicle can be approximated by an ellipsoid. The
origin of the body-ﬁxed frame is located in the center of the buoyancy and we set the
axes to be the principal axes of the displaced ﬂuid. In this case the matrix Θf (see (3.4))
is a diagonal matrix. Suppose that the vector r is along the third axis; more precisely
r = (0, 0, 1).
In the papers [8], [9], [10], [11] is supposed that the principal axes of
displaced ﬂuid coincide with the principal axes of the vehicle. In this paper we consider
a more general situation, we suppose that the third axis is a principal axis of inertia for
the vehicle but the ﬁrst and second axes of the vehicle-ﬁxed frame may not be principal
axes of inertia for the vehicle. Using our hypotheses and the relation (3.3) we deduce:

then the equilibrium point (3.11) is Lyapunov stable.
Proof. By direct calculus we observe that the point (− ml

the function Hue. The Hessian matrix calculated in the equilibrium point has the components:

By using the hypotheses of this Theorem and the inequalities (3.10) we observe that the Hessian
matrix is positive deﬁnite. Applying the Theorem 3.3 we obtain the announced result.

We remark that the conditions for the stability of an equilibrium point of type (3.11) do not
depend by the position of the ﬁrst and second axes of inertia of the vehicle in the perpendicular
plane on the third axis of the vehicle-ﬁxed frame. The conditions for the stability of the above
theorem have been obtained in Theorem 2 of the paper [8] for the particular case when the
principal axes of inertia of the displaced ﬂuid and the principal axes of inertia of the underwater
vehicle are coincident. In the paper [10] is used the energy-Casimir method to prove the stability
of an equilibrium point.
