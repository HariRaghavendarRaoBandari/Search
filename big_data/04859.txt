(Dated: March 17, 2016)

We explore the phenomenology of a class of models where the dark matter particle can inelastically
up-scatter to a heavier excited state via oﬀ-diagonal dipolar interactions with the interstellar plasma
(gas or free electrons). The heavier particle then rapidly decays back to the dark matter particle plus
a quasi-monochromatic photon. For the process to occur at appreciable rates, the mass splitting
between the heavier state and the dark matter must be comparable to, or smaller than, the kinetic
energy of particles in the plasma. As a result, the predicted photon line falls in the soft X-ray range,
or, potentially, at arbitrarily lower energies. We explore experimental constraints from cosmology
and particle physics, and present accurate calculations of the dark matter thermal relic density
and of the ﬂux of monochromatic X-rays from thermal plasma excitation. We ﬁnd that the model
provides a natural explanation for the observed 3.5 keV line from clusters of galaxies and from
the Galactic center, and is consistent with null detections of the line from dwarf galaxies. The
unique line shape, which will be resolved by future observations with the Hitomi (formerly Astro-H)
satellite, and the predicted unique morphology and target-temperature dependence will enable easy
discrimination of this class of models versus other scenarios for the generation of the 3.5 keV line or
of any other unidentiﬁed line across the electromagnetic spectrum.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The particle nature of dark matter remains a mystery.
Astronomical observations can be directly used to con-
strain or detect certain models of particle dark matter
[1]. Dark matter pair-annihilation or decay generically
produces photons, either promptly or through the decay
of products of the annihilation or decay event; photons
also arise from the secondary emission of the produced
electrons and positrons [2]. Other mechanisms produc-
ing electromagnetic emission from dark matter include,
for instance, the Primakoﬀ-like conversion of axion-like
particles into photons in the presence of an external mag-
netic ﬁeld [3].

Here, we present a completely novel mechanism to de-
tect dark matter with astronomical observations. Our
idea is that the dark matter sector consists of two phys-
ical states: a light state which is stable and is the dark
matter particle, and a second, heavier state. The two
dark-sector particles interact with themselves and with
Standard Model particles through an eﬀective operator
which is an inelastic electric or magnetic dipole inter-
action term. This operator is responsible for two key
features of our model:

1. the dark matter relic density, which is set almost

entirely by co-annihilation processes;

2. the production of quasi-monochromatic photons,

with typical energies corresponding to the mass
splitting between the heavier state and the dark
matter particle.

The latter process produces a detectable ﬂux of photons
if the excitation rate for the heavy particle is large, and
if the heavy particle decays quickly to the dark matter
particle and a photon.

In this study we explore in detail the phenomenology
and properties of this novel indirect dark matter detection
channel.
In particular, we show that the thermal relic
density of the dark matter is easily accommodated for the
same choice of parameters for which our model predicts a
detectable ﬂux of X-ray photons from excitations of the
dark matter by collisions with the interstellar plasma,
and for a broad range of masses.

The signal strength predicted in our model depends on
a peculiar combination of the dark matter number den-
sity times the interstellar plasma number density, which
falls in the class of signal morphology explored for exam-
ple in Ref. [4]. The signal also depends on the kinetic
energy of the plasma particles, and thus if the plasma is
in thermal equilibrium, the plasma temperature is a key
factor as to whether or not the excitation rate is signif-
icant. As a result, systems such as clusters of galaxies,
which host abundant dark matter and thermal plasma
with characteristic temperatures of a few keV, are ex-
pected to produce bright dark matter de-excitation lines.
Also, we expect to detect this line in the Milky Way cen-
ter, a relatively nearby location which again possesses
both large plasma and dark matter densities. However,
in our scenario no signal is to be expected from local
dwarf galaxies, which have very small, if any, interstellar
gas. Likewise, we do not expect any signal from small,
distant galaxies.

Interestingly, the generic features expected in our

2

model match observations of a recently discovered X-ray
line at 3.5 keV, whose origin remains somewhat contro-
versial. The line has been discovered in 2014 in obser-
vations of individual and stacked clusters of galaxies [5].
A line at the same energy was subsequently discovered
in the center of the Milky Way [6], while its detection
in M31 is debated and, at best, inconclusive [6–8]. On
the other hand, no signal was detected neither in observa-
tions of dwarf spheroidal galaxies [9], which most notably
includes recent, deep (∼ 1.6 Msec) XMM observations of
the Draco dwarf galaxy [10], nor in stacked observations
of galaxies and groups of galaxies [11].

Some excitement arose from the detection of the 3.5
keV line based on the statement in Ref. [5] that the most
plausible elemental line around 3.5 keV, from atomic
de-excitation transitions of He-like potassium ions (K
XVIII), would require an overabundance of K compared
to solar of about 30, and thus would be “physically diﬃ-
cult to understand”. Additionally, the energy and bright-
ness of the line was found to be in principle compatible
with what expected from the radiative decay of 7.1 keV
sterile neutrinos with lifetimes of the order of 1029 s [5].
Other models have since then been extensively discussed
in connection with a possible exotic origin of the line (see
e.g. the recent review [12]).

There are convincing reasons to believe that the line
does in fact originate from K XVIII transitions. The
original argument in Bulbul et al [5] that this is unlikely
because the required K overabundance compared to solar
would be on the order of 30 is very likely incorrect for at
least two reasons:

1. The K solar abundance utilized in Ref. [5] is the
photospheric abundance, rather than the coronal
abundance, which is about one order of magni-
tude larger [13] and which is the relevant quantity
as a proxy to the K abundance in the interstellar
medium;

2. The temperature models utilized in Ref. [5] are
skewed towards large temperatures (compared for
example to what inferred from same-element ratios
such as Ca XIX to Ca XX) resulting in a bright-
ness for the K line suppressed by up to one order
of magnitude (see e.g. ﬁg. 4 in Ref. [8]).

Perhaps even more critically, Ref. [14] showed that the
morphology of the 3.5 keV photons from Perseus and
from the Milky Way matches closely the morphology of
other elemental lines, rather than what expected from,
for example, dark matter decay. This morphology by it-
self rules out a dark matter decay interpretation for the
line [14]. If an exotic origin is invoked, the associated line
emission should correlate spatially quite closely with the
hot plasma in clusters and, possibly, in the Galaxy. One
such possibility is axion-like conversion in magnetic ﬁelds
[15], although this scenario is not necessarily directly con-
nected with dark matter, and the model parameters are
tuned ad hoc to explain the observed signal.

Within the context of the scenario we consider here,
it is instead natural to have a thermal relic dark matter
candidate that produces a 3.5 keV line with (i) the re-
quired morphology, (ii) the required intensity to explain
observations in clusters and in the Milky Way center, and
that (iii) has suppressed emission from systems with low
plasma temperatures and densities, such as dwarf galax-
ies.

Our model is rather economical from the standpoint of
input parameters. In fact, the model is entirely deﬁned
by (1) the masses of the two particles (or, equivalently,
the dark matter particle mass and the mass splitting of
the heavier state), (2) the eﬀective electric and magnetic
dipole moment couplings, cE,M /Λ. As we will show be-
low, the magnetic dipole controls the thermal relic den-
sity (the electric dipole featuring a p-wave suppression
in the co-annihilation cross section), while the electric
dipole dominates the scattering oﬀ of free electrons and
protons in the interstellar plasma (the electrons dominat-
ing the rate at low dark matter masses, mX (cid:38) 50 MeV,
and the protons for larger dark matter masses, mX (cid:38) 50
MeV).

The scenario we discuss here generically produces a
bright, detectable X-ray (or lower energy) line, with the
line width given by a geometric average of the dark mat-
ter and interstellar plasma velocity dispersions. Thus,
as long as the line is resolved, for example with the ex-
pected energy resolution of the recently launched Hitomi
(formerly known as Astro-H) satellite [16], this scenario
is observationally distinguishable and unique from both
thermal plasma emission and from other new physics
models.

In connection with the question of the nature of the 3.5
keV line, our models explains the observational features
of the line as a result of excitations generated by the scat-
tering of the dark matter oﬀ of electrons and protons in
the thermal plasma, as long as the plasma temperature
is large enough to allow the excitation transition. The
resulting morphology traces the product of the plasma
density and the dark matter density, in qualitative agree-
ment with what was observed in Ref. [14]. Additionally,
the dark matter particle is naturally produced as a cold
thermal relic from the early universe, dominantly from
coannihilation processes. Crucially, we stress that the
model we propose as a possible counterpart to the 3.5
keV line can be falsiﬁed with forthcoming observations
with Hitomi, and would be strikingly diﬀerent than for
example axion-like particle conversion or dark matter de-
cay.

We present the results of our study as follows. We
introduce in Section II the eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT)
framework to investigate X-ray production from dark
matter excitations. Such an EFT captures a large class
of plausible UV completions, which we mention in what
follows, and it allows a simple analysis in terms of two
masses and of two coupling parameters. We identify the
allowed range for these parameters in Section III, where
we impose current experimental bounds. Dark matter

production in the early universe through thermal freeze-
out is discussed in Section IV. With experimental and
relic density constraints at hand, we ﬁnally compute the
ﬂux of X-rays from dark matter excitations and decays.
General ﬂuxes for arbitrary dark matter mass and mass
splitting are presented in Section V, which ends with an
analysis of the speciﬁc case of the 3.5 keV X-ray line.
Conclusions are given in Section VI.

(DM) excitations, and in Section V we show that inter-
actions mediated by the electric dipole moment utterly
dominate the up-scattering rate.

The analysis of a microscopic origin for the eﬀective
interactions in Eq. (2) is beyond the scope of this work,
and UV-complete models can be constructed along the
lines of e.g. Ref. [17].

II. EFFECTIVE INTERACTIONS FOR

INELASTIC DARK MATTER

We introduce a simple EFT for the dark sector of
this theory. We augment the Standard Model (SM) of
particles physics with two additional gauge-singlet Weyl
fermions ξ and η, which are the only particles taken odd
under a Z2 symmetry. As a consequence of this discrete
symmetry, the particle corresponding to the lighter mass
eigenstate is stable. The most general mass Lagrangian
for the new degrees of freedom reads

Lmass = −µ ξη −

(1)

The EFT is valid only below a cutoﬀ scale Λ, which is
interpreted as the mass of some heavy particles we inte-
grate out to generate the eﬀective interactions between
the SM and the new fermions. The mass parameters
(µ, δξ, δη) are consistently taken below the EFT cutoﬀ.
SM gauge invariance and the Z2 symmetry1 forbid any
renormalizable interaction with SM ﬁelds. The lowest-
order non-renormalizable interactions one can write down
are the electric and magnetic dipole moments

The operator with coeﬃcient cM (cE) is a CP-even(-odd)
magnetic (electric) dipole moment. As we explicitly dis-
cuss in Section IV, thermal freeze-out is likely to be dom-
inated by the magnetic dipole interactions, since annihi-
lations mediated by the electric dipole are p-wave sup-
pressed. The situation is reversed for the dark matter

of the Z2 symmetry. Here, L and H are the SM lepton and
Higgs doublets, respectively. These operators, together with the
Majorana mass terms in Eq. (1), would violate lepton number.

which follows from the Lagrangian in Eq. (1). The three
mass parameters are in general complex numbers. We
always have the freedom to redeﬁne the ﬁelds ξ and η to
make two mass parameters real and positive. Here, we
assume that all the mass parameters are real and positive,
and the dipole operators in Eq. (2) are given in the basis
where this is the case.

us to express the mass eigenvalues in the  (cid:28) 1 limit

Here, we deﬁne mχ to be the mass of the stable DM
particle, and we denote the mass splitting with the ex-
cited state by δ. Observationally, δ is a quantity of the
utmost importance, as it sets the photon energy for the
photon produced in the χ2 → χ1 + γ decay. The  (cid:28) 1
limit, necessary in our framework to get a small relative
mass splitting, can be justiﬁed by a hypothetical U (1)
symmetry in the UV complete theory that protects the
Majorana mass terms δξ,η. Thus this limit can be quite
natural. Strictly speaking, we do not need to forbid Ma-
jorana masses to be in this regime of validity, since all we
need is the degeneracy between the two Majorana masses
in order to have δξ − δη (cid:28) µ. The “line” generated in the
χ2 → χ1 + γ decay is thus at an energy that is eﬀectively
a free parameter in our scenario.

The mass eigenstates can also be computed analyt-
ically. Here, we report the relevant expressions, once
again in the  (cid:28) 1 limit,

Interactions for Mass Eigenstates

We conclude this Section with the eﬀective interactions
in Eq. (2) for the mass eigenstates identiﬁed in Eqs. (11)
and (12). We express the resulting Lagrangian in terms
of the four-component Majorana fermions

It is straightforward to use the properties of the four-
component Majorana spinors in Eq. (13) to check that
this Lagrangian is hermitian. Whenever the mass split-
ting plays a crucial role, as for example in the calculation
of the excited state lifetime or the up-scattering rate, we
use the interactions as given in Eq. (14). However, to
compute the thermal relic density or limits from virtual
DM eﬀects, the eﬀect of the mass splitting is completely
irrelevant. In these latter cases we perform our calcula-
tions in what we call the “Dirac limit”, namely when the
interactions can be taken as in Eq. (2).

III. EXPERIMENTAL CONSTRAINTS

In this Section we analyze what region of the EFT pa-
rameter space is allowed by current experimental bounds.
We then study, in the allowed range of parameters, the
thermal production of DM and the predicted ﬂux of
X-rays from DM excitation in Sec. IV and V, respec-
tively. We do not report here constraints not relevant
to our analysis, such as DM-induced contributions to:
muon anomalous magnetic moment, electric dipole mo-
ments of charged SM fermions, Z-pole observables, in-
visible B and K meson decays. We checked that all of
those constraints are not competitive with the one com-
ing from the electromagnetic coupling running we dis-
cuss below [18]. Additionally, searches for mono-photon
and mono-jet events at colliders are performed at energy
scales above the typical cutoﬀ values we are interested in
(Λ (cid:39) 200 GeV). A correct interpretation of these nega-
tive searches would thus require the speciﬁcation of the

through the reaction χ2 → χ1γ. We plot iso-contours in the

lifetime can be obtained by simply rescaling as in Eq. (16).

underlying UV-complete theory giving the eﬀective inter-
actions in Eq. (2), which is model-dependent and beyond
the scope of this work.

A. Big Bang Nucleosynthesis

Light degrees of freedom can alter Big Bang Nucle-
osynthesis (BBN) and spoil the successful prediction of
light elements abundance. We impose two types of BBN
constraints:

1. We consider the possibility for DM to freeze-out
after neutrino decoupling. DM annihilation would
then heat the SM plasma with respect to the cos-
mic neutrino background, decreasing the value of
the eﬀective relativistic number of degrees of free-
dom at the BBN epoch Neﬀ [19]. We impose the
conservative bound of the DM mass mχ (cid:38) 10 MeV,
such that DM freeze-out takes place always before
neutrinos decouple.

2. An additional concern pertains the timing for the
decay of the excited states χ2. As will be ex-
plained in detail
in Sec. IV, thermal freeze-out
democratically populates the universe with χ2 and
χ1 through co-annihilations. The excited state χ2
has a decay width

in the small mass splitting limit, where the masses
are given by Eqs. (9) and (10).
Interestingly, in
such a limit the decay width is controlled only by
the mass splitting δ and not by the overall mass
scale mχ. Plugging in typical values for the pa-
rameters we are interested in, we ﬁnd the lifetime
τχ2→χ1γ = Γ−1
χ2→χ1γ to be typically shorter than
the BBN timescale:

(16)

A thorough exploration of the (Λ, δ) plane is pro-
vided in Fig. 1, where we show iso-contours of the
excited state lifetime (the scaling for diﬀerent val-
ues of cM or cE is entirely trivial). For the param-
eter range we are interested in this is always below
τBBN (cid:39) 1 s and BBN is thus safe.

B. Cosmic Microwave Background

Out-of-equilibrium DM annihilation after freeze-out
can change the recombination history and leave an im-
print in the CMB spectrum [20–22]. CMB anisotropies
bound the DM annihilation strength (cid:104)σvrel(cid:105), putting an
upper limit on the quantity

pann = feﬀ (cid:104)σvrel(cid:105)
mDM

.

(17)

Here, the eﬃciency parameter feﬀ depends on the spe-
ciﬁc DM annihilation channel. The energy injection takes
place over a narrow window of redshift values, thus it is
reasonable to approximate feﬀ (cid:39) const [22–24]. The val-
ues for feﬀ as a function of the DM mass and for diﬀerent
annihilation channels can be found in Ref. [25]. The lat-
est Planck results on CMB anisotropies [26] give the limit

(cid:104)σvrel(cid:105) < feﬀ × 4.1 × 10−28 cm3s−1 (cid:16) mDM

.

(18)

(cid:17)

GeV

For mDM around 1 GeV, this bound is approximately two
orders of magnitude below the value needed at freeze-out

(cid:104)σvrel(cid:105)th = 3 × 10−26 cm3s−1 in order to reproduce the

observed DM density.

We have three possible DM annihilation ﬁnal states:
leptons, hadrons and photons. The associated Feynman
diagrams are shown in Fig. 2. Detailed results for the
cross sections can be found in Sec. IV, where we discuss
thermal freeze-out. For the purpose of this CMB bound
discussion, we limit ourselves to two observations:

1. The annihilation to leptons and hadrons proceeds
through an s-channel photon exchange with an oﬀ-
diagonal vertex. At the time of recombination all
the χ2 have decayed to the stable χ1, therefore this
contribution is absent.

5

FIG. 2: Feynman diagrams for DM (co)-annihilations. The
co-annihilations to leptons (left), as well as the ones to
hadrons computed as described in the text, totally dominate
the Λ−4 suppressed annihilation to photons (right). In both
cases, the crossed circle denotes the insertion of the eﬀective
magnetic or electric dipole operator.

2. Annihilation to two photons, through the diagram
sketched on the right of Fig. 2, is still possible, al-
beit this channel is suppressed by a double insertion
of the dimension-5 dipole operator. This channel
has minimal impact on the thermal production of
dark matter. As explicitly shown in Eq. (28) in
χ/Λ2 suppression is quite
the next Section, this m2
severe and makes this contribution irrelevant for
CMB constraints.

We conclude that CMB limits do not constrain our frame-
work.

C. Direct Detection

The long-range dipole interactions are responsible for
quite sizable rates in direct detection (DD) experiments.
As is well known [18, 27, 28], this is one of the main rea-
sons why the Wilson coeﬃcients of the dipole operators
are severely constrained. However, in our framework as
outlined in Sec. II the dipole interactions are oﬀ-diagonal
and DD can only go through an inelastic channel [29].
Hence DD limits depend on the speciﬁc value of the split-
ting δ, controlling the threshold velocity for the inelastic
scattering, and also on the speciﬁc experiment because
of diﬀerent energy thresholds to detect the recoil.
We focus our analysis on a mass range mχ (cid:46) 1 GeV,
where the nuclear recoil energy for DM scattering oﬀ of
nuclei is way below any current experimental threshold,
even for the case of elastic scattering. In such a low DM
mass range the most promising probe for DD is scatter-
ing oﬀ of electrons. Xenon10 already put limits on this
sub-GeV DM mass range [30, 31], which will be further
improved by future experiments [32, 33]. However, these
bounds consider the elastic case. The condition to have
inelastic scattering reads

δ <

1
2

mχme

mχ + me

v2 (cid:39) mev2,

(19)

where δ as above is the mass splitting between the dark
sector fermions. While δ is an arbitrary parameter, we
are interested in keV emission, thus δ (cid:39) keV. For a typ-
ical WIMP velocity v (cid:39) 10−3 this condition only applies

χ1χ2l+l−χ1χ1γγγχ26

to very small mass splitting, on the order of fractions of
an eV. Given the mass splitting range of a few keV we
are interested in there is no signal in this type of exper-
imental set-up. Thus as long as mχ (cid:46) 1 GeV our model
is not constrained by DD exclusion bounds.

D. Electromagnetic Coupling Running

The contact interaction between DM particles and the
photon alters the running of the electromagnetic coupling
at low energies. This eﬀect can be quantiﬁed by comput-
ing the one-loop contribution to the photon self-energy
accounting for DM particles in the loop. We defer the
details of the calculation to App. A.

The running of the electromagnetic coupling is aﬀected

as follows:

αem(q2) =

α0

1 − C ∆α(q2)

.

(20)

The ﬁne structure constant α0 is measured with ex-
tremely high precision via the anomalous electron mag-
netic moment [34]. The function ∆α(q2) accounts for
only the SM degrees of freedom [35–38], therefore in the
absence of the DM particles we would just have C = 1.
The DM contribution enters C as follows

pression is given in Eq. (A15). We take the the LEP mea-
surement of the running electromagnetic coupling [39, 40]
that are all performed at momentum transfers larger than
the DM masses under consideration. For our purposes we
can simplify Eq. (A15) in this limit. We ﬁnd

We evaluate the DM contribution for mχ = 10 MeV, cor-
responding to the minimum DM mass we consider, which
is also the case when the eﬀect on the running is max-
imized. Plugging the lowest value of (−q2) within the
range probed by the analysis in Ref. [40], and imposing

that we do not violate the bound in Eq. (23) beyond 1σ,

ing for diﬀerent Wilson coeﬃcients is straightforward.

IV. DARK MATTER RELIC DENSITY

In this section we demonstrate that in our model, and
for parameter values compatible with the constraints dis-
cussed above, the stable DM particle χ1 can be produced
in the early universe through thermal freeze-out. As we
have extensively discussed in the previous Section, we
are interested in the DM mass range mχ (cid:38) 10 MeV and a
mass splitting δ (cid:39) few keV. Thus at the freeze-out epoch,
happening when the universe had a temperature approx-
imately Tf (cid:39) mχ/20, we expect the excited state χ2
to be thermally populated; as a result, co-annihilations
have to be accounted for. However, since we work in the
δ (cid:28) mχ regime, we can treat the (χ1, χ2) system as a
Dirac fermion with mass mχ and compute the annihila-
tion cross sections in the “Dirac limit” of Sec. II, namely
by using the eﬀective Lagrangian in Eq. (2).

Three possible (co-)annihilation channels keep the DM
in thermal equilibrium at early times. Both electric and
magnetic dipoles allow the DM to annihilate to lepton
pair ﬁnal states, as shown in the Feynman diagram on the
left of Fig. 2. In the non-relativistic limit, appropriate for
a cold relic as in our case, we calculate a cross section

As clear from the formula above, annihilation processes
mediated by magnetic and electric dipole moments are
s- and p-wave processes, respectively. For DM masses
above the pion mass, the same interaction vertex with
the photon is responsible for annihilation to hadrons. We
evaluate this contribution by using the measured value of
the observable

Rh(√s) =

σe+e− → hadrons
σe+e− → µ+µ−

.

(26)

We import numerical values for Rh(√s) from the Particle
Data Group public webpage 2, which gives the value of

this observable for √s > 0.36 GeV. We ﬁll the gap in
the region 2mπ ≤ √s ≤ 0.36 GeV by using e+e−

scattering data from Ref. [41]. The annihilation cross
section to hadrons results in

σχχ → hadrons = Rh(√s = 2mχ) × σχχ → µ+µ− .

hilation to photons shown on the right of Fig. 2. The

where T is the temperature of the relativistic bath in
thermal equilibrium. The total annihilation cross section
includes three contributions. Processes with ﬁnal state
electrons, with cross section as in Eq. (30), are always
kinematically allowed for the DM mass range we are in-
terested in. Annihilations to muons, with cross section
given in Eq. (30), and to hadrons, with cross section ob-
tained through Rh(√s) as in Eq. (27), have to be ac-
counted for only if kinematically allowed.

The Boltzmann equation is conveniently solved in
terms of the comoving number density Yχ = nχ/s, where
s is the entropy density of the relativistic species. Since
we are interested in sub-GeV DM, thermal freeze-out is
likely to occur during the QCD phase transitions. We
take the QCD equation of state, necessary to evaluate
the entropy density s and therefore Yχ, from Ref. [42]. At
temperatures much lower than the one at the freeze-out
epoch Tf , the comoving density approaches a constant
value Y ∞

FIG. 3: DM relic density as a function of Λ for three diﬀerent
DM masses (lines with diﬀerent colors) for purely magnetic
dipole interactions (cM = 1, dot-dashed lines) and purely
electric dipole interactions (cE = 1, solid lines).

The factor of 2 in Eq. (31) accounts for the fact that we
are dealing with a Dirac fermion. Finally, we compute
the dark matter contribution to the Ω parameter

Ωχh2 =

ρχ
ρcr/h2 ,

where the critical density is given by [43]

ρcr/h2 = 1.05375 × 10−5 GeV cm−3 .

(34)

(35)

The output of this calculation has to confront the latest
measured value by Planck ΩDMh2 = 0.1188± 0.0010 [26].
Our ﬁnal results are summarized in Fig. 3, where we plot
the relic density as a function of the suppression scale Λ.
We choose three representative value for the DM mass,
mχ = (10 MeV, 100 MeV, 1 GeV), and for each case we
compute the relic density for magnetic dipole (cM = 1,
dot-dashed lines) and electric dipole (cE = 1, solid lines)
interactions. While the ﬁgure was produced for cM,E = 1,
it is straightforward to obtain the relic density for arbi-
trary Wilson coeﬃcients just by dividing the result of
Fig. 3 by c 2

M,E.

A noteworthy feature of Fig. 3 is that the magnetic
dipole lines are always well below the ones for electric
dipole moments. This can be understood by looking at
Eq. (25), which shows that the latter are p-wave processes
and therefore yield a larger relic density.

It is interesting to discuss the dependence on the DM
mass. The annihilation cross section for mχ = 10 MeV
and mχ = 100 MeV is dominated by electron/positron
ﬁnal states and it is approximately the same for both
mass values. Despite the two cross sections being identi-
cal, the resulting DM relic density is not the same. This
residual DM mass dependence is a consequence of the g∗
dependence on the freeze-out temperature Tf (cid:39) mχ/20,
one order of magnitude diﬀerent in the two cases. The

quite diﬀerent DM relic density for mχ = 1 GeV is per-
haps more obvious, as hadronic channels are kinemati-
cally available, suppressing the total relic density.

To summarize, both magnetic and electric dipole mo-
ments can reproduce the observed DM density. For each
choice of the DM mass and the suppression scale Λ, all we
have to do is to choose cM or cE such that Ωχh2 (cid:39) 0.12.
The relic density for arbitrary values of cM,E is obtained
by taking the results shown in Fig. 3 and dividing the
predicted value of the relic density in the ﬁgure by c 2
M,E.
As we are about to see in the next Section the excitation
rate is dominated by cE, therefore once both couplings
are present and comparable we have a remarkable feature
of our model: The relic density and the X-ray lines rate
are independently controlled by the magnetic and by the
electric dipole moments, respectively. For the range of
parameters we are interested in, Wilson coeﬃcients for
the magnetic dipole in the range 0.1 (cid:46) cM (cid:46) 1 are what
is needed to account for the observed DM density.

V. X-RAYS FROM DARK MATTER

EXCITATION

In this Section we evaluate the predicted ﬂux of X-ray

photons originating from the excitation process

χ1 f → χ2 f ,

followed by the decay process

χ2 → χ1γ .

(36)

(37)

The Feynman diagram for the up-scattering is shown in
Fig. 4. The particle f is a SM fermion present in the
plasma. For simplicity we consider contributions from
electrons and protons and neglect that from heavier el-
ements. The excited state χ2 is quite short-lived com-
pared to cosmological timescales, as explicitly shown in
Eq. (16). Hence once the DM up-scatters oﬀ of a plasma
fermion into the χ2 particle, the subsequent decay back
to the stable DM particle χ1 and the consequent emis-
sion of a X-ray photon are eﬀectively instantaneous. The
ﬁnal state photon energy is equal to the mass splitting
between the two fermion states (up to corrections due to
the velocity distribution of the plasma fermion and of the
dark matter, as discussed below):

The integration is over the relative velocity in the CM

Before discussing the two cases we are interested in,
namely the Perseus cluster of galaxies and the Galactic
Center, we point out a few general facts about the X-
ray line rates in our framework. The above discussion
is very general and does not assume any speciﬁc type of
interaction mediating the inelastic collision in Eq. (36).
We specialize now on the dipole interactions introduced
in Section II. We are considering an inelastic collision,
therefore the cross section has to be computed by using
the Lagrangian for mass eigenstates given in Eq. (14).

The expression for the up-scattering cross section is
quite involved. It is helpful to look at the limiting case
when the mass splitting is negligible [18]:

for magnetic and electric dipole moments, respectively.
Both expressions are divergent at small θ. Furthermore,
the cross section for the process mediated by the dipole
is also divergent at small relative velocities. The intro-
duction of a ﬁnite mass splitting regularizes all the above
divergences and our ﬁnal results are thus ﬁnite. The use-
fulness of Eqs.(48) and (49) is in the small velocity behav-
ior: since we are interested in the non-relativistic regime,
we expect the electric dipole contribution to dominate
the total excitation rate.

This can be quantiﬁed by performing the full compu-
tation of the cross section and evaluating the thermal
average as prescribed by Eq. (43). Giving the scaling of
our dipole interactions in Eq. (14), the thermal average
can be parameterized as follows:

E ΣR(mχ, δ)(cid:3) .

M ΣM (mχ, δ) + c2

(50)

(cid:2)c2

(cid:104)σvrel(cid:105) =

Λ2

In this expression we assume the other parameters (i.e.
the DM dispersion velocity, fermion mass and tempera-
ture) to be ﬁxed, and therefore the functions ΣM,E to
only depend on the DM mass and on the mass splitting.

For the sole purpose of illustration we ﬁx

v0 = 10−3c ,
mf = (511 keV, 938 MeV) ,

Tf = 5 keV .

(51)

The two diﬀerent values of mf correspond to electrons
and protons, respectively. For this choice of parameters,
we plot in Fig. 5 the functions ΣM,E deﬁned in Eq. (50)
as a function of the DM mass for δ = 1 keV < Tf . In
particular, we have δ < Tf and the plasma kinetic energy
is able to easily excite χ1 to the heavier state χ2.

As correctly anticipated above, rates from electric
dipoles are always larger than those from magnetic
dipoles. This eﬀect is due to the small velocity singularity

FIG. 5: Functions ΣM,E deﬁned as in Eq. (50) as a function
of the DM mass. The parameters are ﬁxed as in Eq. (51)

for magnetic and dipole moments with dot-dashed and solid
lines, respectively. Moreover, we separate the contribution
from electrons (blue lines) and protons (red lines).

in Eq. (49), regularized now by the ﬁnite mass splitting,
but still capable of enhancing by orders of magnitude
the total rate. Another interesting feature of Fig. 5 is
the drastically diﬀerent behavior between scattering oﬀ
of electrons and protons. Scattering oﬀ of electrons is
independent on mχ for the DM mass range under inves-
tigation.
In contrast, scattering oﬀ of protons is much
more eﬃcient for larger DM masses. This is a combina-
tion of two eﬀects. The Maxwell-Boltzmann suppression
for the proton is more severe, as it can be easily seen from
the explicit expression for F(vrel) in Eq. (45). However,
Eq. (45) is not sensitive to the DM mass, which enters
only by setting the threshold velocity. This kinematical
limit is given in Eq. (44), where the reduced mass of the
DM-fermion system appears in the denominator. There-
fore, for mχ below the proton mass the threshold velocity
is just too high to be thermally accessible.

B. Perseus

We focus here on the ﬁrst of two illustrative cases, the
Perseus cluster. The rate of dark matter excitation by
the interstellar plasma is given by Eq. (39). The eﬀective
plasma-times-dark matter number density κeﬀ as deﬁned
in Eq. (40) is calculated following Ref. [14], for the ob-
servationally relevant angular region. We use a Navarro-
Frenk-White density proﬁle [44] for the dark matter den-
sity distribution in the Perseus cluster of the form

The magnetic contribution is negligible. The ﬂux of the
X-ray line from electric dipole interactions has an in-
teresting dependence on mχ: At low DM mass, mχ (cid:39)
10 MeV, the rate is dominated by scattering oﬀ of elec-
trons and it falls as m−1
χ because of the depletion in the
DM number density, see Eq. (56). As the DM mass be-
comes larger than mχ (cid:39) 100 MeV, scattering oﬀ of pro-
tons becomes eﬃcient for the reasons explained at the
end of Section V A. This induces a temporary rise in the
ﬂux, which eventually starts falling again because of the
number density depletion once the proton up-scattering
cross section reaches its asymptotic limit.

C. Galactic Center

FIG. 6: Predicted rate of X-ray photons from the Perseus
cluster as a function of the DM mass. We show contribu-
tions from both magnetic (dot-dashed lines) and electric (solid
lines). Here, we set δ = 3.5 keV and Λ = 200 GeV. The green
band indicates the 2σ region for the observed 3.5 keV line
ﬂux [5].

We perform an analogous analysis for the X-ray data
from the Galactic center (GC) Ref. [6]. In this case we
conservatively consider a cored Burkert proﬁle [48] for
the dark matter density (other possibilities are discussed
below)

The parameters are derived using the results of Ref. [45]
with the concentration-mass
relation as quoted in
Ref. [46],

Rs = 445 kpc ,

Moreover, we ﬁx the mass splitting to δ = 3.5 keV and

the rates with Λ is straightforward).

The results for the ﬂuxes are shown in Fig. 6, where
we also include the 3.5 keV line ﬂux as quoted in Ref. [5].

We set ρ0 = 2.9 GeV/cm3 and Rs = 6.0 kpc [14]. The in-
terstellar gas density is taken to be the sum of the “thick”
and “thin” disk components of Ref. [49], with the param-
eters provided in Tab. 2 and 3 in Ref. [49]. We do not
include the contribution from the central molecular zone,
as the contribution from similar molecular clouds is ab-
sent from the modeling of the plasma density for Perseus.
For the GC plasma temperature we consider a multi-
temperature model consisting of an admixture of two
diﬀerent temperatures: Tf = 1 keV with density 4/5
of the total, and the remaining 1/5 with temperature
Tf = 7 keV [6]. We checked that employing a single-
temperature model does not aﬀect our results signiﬁ-
cantly. The resulting normalization factor for the ex-
citation rate from the Galactic center is

We present results for the photon ﬂux and compari-

Ref. [6], in Fig. 7.

We also considered other choices for the dark matter
density proﬁle. For example, employing a Navarro-Frenk-
White density proﬁle [44] the predicted rate of X-rays
from excitation would be around one order of magnitude
larger than with a Burkert proﬁle. This could still be
made consistent with observations from Perseus if a frac-
tion of the 3.5 X-ray there were associated with emission
from e.g. K XVIII de-excitation.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Fig. 6 and 7 illustrate that our model predicts X-ray
ﬂuxes from dark matter thermal plasma excitations from
the Galactic center and from Perseus compatible with
observations for a range of dark matter masses. For the
choice cM = cE = 1 and Λ = 200 GeV, this mass range
is in the 10-20 MeV mass range; larger values for cE/Λ
would shift the preferred mass range to larger masses; the
same would be true if a fraction of the observed X-ray
ﬂux at 3.5 keV were to be attributed to other mechanisms
than the one under consideration, for example from K
ions.

Fig. 8 examines, for a mass mχ = 15 MeV, the param-
eter space in the (Λ/cM , Λ/cE) plane compatible with
X-ray observations and producing a thermal relic dark
matter abundance in accordance with the observed cos-
mological dark matter density. The red shaded region
is compatible with the observed ﬂux from Perseus, and
the blue region with the ﬂux detected from the Galactic
center (assuming a Burkert density proﬁle, and assum-
ing the whole 3.5 keV line ﬂux is associated only with
dark matter de-excitations). Finally, the orange region
is compatible with dark matter being entirely produced
as a thermal relic, and the grey region is excluded by the
running of the electromagnetic coupling.

We thus ﬁnd that there exists theory parameter space
where our models features a thermal relic that explains
the 3.5 keV line observations. The preferred ratio of
the Wilson coeﬃcients, for the mass choice we made, is
cE/cM ∼ 10− 15, which is not incompatible with generic
theoretical expectations for the two parameters being in
a similar ballpark.

We emphasize once again that while our model does

FIG. 8: Summary plot for mχ = 15 MeV.

provide a consistent explanation to the observational
landscape of the 3.5 keV line for thermal relic dark
matter, the mass splitting between the two dark sector
fermions is a free parameter. As a result, lines could be
produced in principle at any energies below the typical
temperatures of the plasma (few keV). This opens up
a brand new observational window to search for signals
from the dark sector. The predicted signals are unique
in three respects:

1. The line-shape is peculiar: it is a geometric product
of the width of the dark matter and of the thermal
plasma velocity distribution (see Eq. (45)); with
suﬃcient energy resolution, such as that expected
for the newly launched Hitomi X-ray satellite [16],
it will be thus possible to discriminate this mech-
anism against other sources of X-ray lines such as
dark matter decay or plasma de-excitation lines;

2. The morphology of the predicted emission depends
on a unique line-of-sight integral of the product of
the plasma density times the dark matter density,
in contrast with other models where the signal de-
pends on the dark matter density, density squared,
or on magnetic ﬁelds;

3. The brightest predicted targets depend not only on
the integral mentioned above, but also on the tar-
get’s temperature: depending on the dark sector
mass splitting, large temperatures might be needed
to excite the heavier particle to signiﬁcant levels;
As a result, colder targets might be signiﬁcantly
dimmer than hotter ones.

In summary, we have proposed and studied in detail
a simple model for the dark sector that oﬀers novel and
unique detection prospects. The model consists of two
(gauge) “sterile” Weyl fermions, odd under a Z2 sym-
metry, and coupled to the Standard Model via an eﬀec-
tive inelastic magnetic and electric dipole operator. The

model eﬀectively contains four parameters: the suppres-
sion scale for the two dipole operators, and the masses of
the two fermions.

We scrutinized in great detail the phenomenology of
the model, and concluded that (i) the mass of the light-
est state is constrained by cosmology to be heavier than
about 10 MeV, and (ii) the strongest constraint on the
scale of the eﬀective dipole operators is from corrections
to the running of the electromagnetic coupling. We then
studied the thermal relic density of the dark matter, and
demonstrated that it is driven by the magnetic dipole
term and can easily match the observed universal dark
matter density for a broad range of dark matter masses.
The model predicts signiﬁcant production of the heavier
fermion from inelastic collision of the lighter (dark mat-
ter) fermion with the thermal plasma in galaxies or clus-
ters of galaxies. This up-scattering rate is driven by the
electric dipole term, and is predicted to source a bright,
detectable line through the decay of the heavier fermion
to the lighter fermion and a quasi-monochromatic pho-
ton.

Remarkably, there exist at least three independent
unique observational handles that could discriminate this
scenario from other background processes producing lines
or other new physics scenarios: the line’s width, its mor-
phology, and the (predictable) dependence on the tar-
get’s temperature. The energy of the predicted line is
essentially a free parameter of the theory, as long as it is

at energies comparable or lower than the typical plasma
temperature of a given astrophysical target. This model
opens a new exciting window for the search of the ﬁrst
non-gravitational manifestation of dark matter as a par-
ticle.

Appendix A: One-loop Running of the

Electromagnetic Coupling

In this Appendix we provide the calculation of the one-
loop electromagnetic coupling running. We evaluate the
contribution to the photon self-energy sketched in Fig. 9
in the “Dirac limit” (e.g. by using Eq. (2)), justiﬁed since
we consider δ (cid:28) mχ. The photon self-energy results in

(A8)

where γE (cid:39) 0.577 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
Therefore in d = 4 − 2 dimensions, up to O() terms,
the quantity L0 deﬁned in Eq. (A7) reads

The term proportional to l2 vanishes in d = 4, and it
can be explicitly checked that it has no d = 4 pole in
dimensional regularization. However, it has a ﬁnite piece
that we keep in our analysis.

The next step is to compute the loop integral

in
Eq. (A4) in d = 4 − 2 space-time dimensions. The two

The one-loop photon self-energy in Eq. (A10) has a
1/ divergence that needs to be renormalized. The pole
proportional to the squared DM mass is taken care of by a
renormalization of the photon kinetic term, as it happens
in regular QED. However, the pole proportional to q2
requires the introduction of a new dimension 6 operator

O6 =

1
4

F µν(cid:50)Fµν .

(A11)

The renormalized photon self-energy is given by the one-
loop contribution in Eq. (A10) summed to the two inﬁnite
counterterms mentioned above

dip(q2) = Πdip(q2) − δ4 − δ6 q2 ,
Πren

(A12)

where δ4 and δ6 are the counterterms for the photon ki-
netic term and the dimension 6 operator in Eq. (A11),
respectively.

The next step is to go from the full self-energy in
Eq. (A12) to the running electromagnetic coupling. We
compare our prediction with Bhabha-scattering data. As
is well known [50], the running coupling is given by

αem(q2) =

α0

1 − Π(q2)

,

(A13)

where α0 is the ﬁne structure constant and Π(q2) is the
full photon self-energy, which is given by the sum of the
SM contribution and the renormalized dipole contribu-
tion in Eq. (A12). The SM contribution to the QED
vacuum polarization is well known [35–38]. All we have
left to do is to add the DM contribution, but before doing
so we have to ﬁx the counterterms δ4 and δ6 appearing
in Eq. (A12). We start from ﬁxing δ4, and we do that by
requiring that αem(q2 = 0) = α0, or in other words we
choose δ4 to make sure that Πren
dip(q2 = 0) = 0 as follows

The renormalization condition at q2 = 0 cannot ﬁx the
counterterm δ6, because its eﬀects vanish in the static
limit. Thus in order to ﬁx δ6 we need another experi-
mental input. At energy scales much smaller than the
DM mass we consider, namely −q2 (cid:28) (10 MeV)2, the

DM particles in the loop cannot aﬀect the gauge cou-
pling running. We evaluate Eq. (A13) in such regime,
and ﬁnd the δ6 we need in order to have only the SM
contribution. The ﬁnal renormalized DM contribution
to the photon self-energy reads

Appendix B: A Simple Formula for the Thermal

Average of the Excitation Rate

The distribution functions can be easily expressed as a
function of V and vrel by using the relations

In this Appendix we derive the simple expression for
the thermal average given in Eq. (43). We start from the
deﬁnition in Eq. (41), which involves six integrals. It is
convenient to change integration variables

v2
χ = vχ · vχ = V 2 +
v2
f = vf · vf = V 2 +

+ V vrel cos γ ,

4 − V vrel cos γ .

(B6)

(B7)

V =

vχ + vf

,

vrel = vχ − vf .

(B1)

(B2)

All we have to do to get to Eq. (45) is to introduce the
explicit form of the distribution functions. We integrate
over the angle γ by using the relation

(cid:90) 1

The up-scattering cross section is a Lorentz-invariant
quantity that depends only on the CM energy √s of the
collision. In the non-relativistic limit we have

(cid:19)2

(cid:18)

s =

mχ + mf +

2

mχmf

v2
rel

,

(B3)

therefore the cross section can only depend on the abso-
lute value of the relative velocity between the two parti-
cles, as correctly reproduced in Eq. (43).

The inelastic collision initial state is characterized by
three quantities: the magnitude of the two velocities and
the angle between them. The integration in the new vari-
ables can be performed in polar coordinates, i.e.
d3V d3vrel → 4π × 2π × dV dvrel d cos γ V 2v2
where we deﬁne γ as the angle between V and vrel. Upon
expressing the thermal average as in Eq. (43), the func-
tion F(vrel) reads
F(vrel) ≡ 8π2v3

Finally, the integration over V can be performed by using

with the ﬁnal expression for F(vrel) as given in Eq. (45).
