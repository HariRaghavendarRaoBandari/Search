Quantum Critical Magneto-transport At A Continuous Metal-Insulator Transition

(Dated: March 8, 2016)

In contrast to the seminal weak localization prediction of a non-critical Hall constant (RH ) at the
Anderson metal-insulator transition (MIT), RH in quite a few real disordered systems exhibits both,
a strong T -dependence and critical scaling near their MIT. Here, we investigate these issues in detail
within a non-perturbative “strong localization” regime. We uncover (i) clear and unconventional
quantum-critical scaling of the γ-function, ﬁnding that γ(gxy) ≃ log(gxy) over a wide range spanning
the continuous MIT, very similar to that seen for the longitudinal conductivity, (ii) strongly T -
dependent and clear quantum critical scaling in both transverse conductivity and RH at the MIT.
These novel features are rationalized in terms of a “strong coupling” view, where inapplicability of
perturbative quasiclassical ideas leads to such novel magneto-transport quantum criticality in the
critical region associated with the MIT.

At low temperatures (T ), transport in normal met-
als arises as a result of scattering of weakly interacting
fermionic (Landau) quasiparticles amongst themselves,
phonons and impurities [1]. Long mean-free paths and
weak inter-quasiparticle interactions allows a coherent
understanding in terms of the relaxation-time approxi-
mation within the quasi-classical Boltzmann theory. Re-
markably, even in clean f -electron heavy Fermi liquids,
this seems to suﬃce [2] for a qualitative description of
zero-ﬁeld transport. However, this appealing idea en-
counters diﬃculties when applied to magneto-transport:
within the relaxation-time approximation, the Hall co-
eﬃcient is

tion and Lij
both L11, L21 > 0, RH is always negative and T -
independent within Boltzmann theory, and transport
is always electron-like. Experimentally, however, RH
generically changes sign at low-to-intermediate T and be-
comes T -dependent, even in the undoubtedly strongly
correlated heavy Fermi liquid regime. This diﬃculty is
even more exacerbated near metal-insulator transitions
(MITs), where the Landau quasiparticle description it-
self breaks down [4]. In fact, in cuprates [5] and some
f -electron systems [6], resistivity and Hall data can only
be reconciled by postulating two distinct relaxation rates,
arising from break-up of an electron, for the decay of
longitudinal and transverse currents.
In many cases,
bad-metallic and linear-in-T resistivities pre-empt use of
Boltzmann transport views altogether, since the picture
of weakly interacting Landau quasiparticles itself breaks

down.

In disorder-driven MITs, combined resistivity and Hall
eﬀect have long been used in the context of the sem-
inal weak-localization (WL) theory [7]. These studies
already threw up interesting hints regarding the inade-
quacy of WL approach upon attempts to reconcile criti-
cal behavior of the dc conductivity with that of the Hall
constant near the disorder-driven MIT [8]. Speciﬁcally,
both σxx(n) ≃ (nc − n)ν and σxy(n) ≃ (nc − n)ν ′
turned
out to be critical at the MIT, and the ratio ν′/ν ≃ 1
in stark contrast to the value of 2 predicted by WL
theory [9]. More recent work on NbN [10] also shows
the following: (i) ρxx(T ) ≃ C + ARH (T ), both increas-
ing with reduction in T over a wide range of kF l, and
(ii) ∆RH /RH ≃ 0.69(∆ρxx(T )/ρxx), widely diﬀerent
from ∆RH /RH ≃ 2.0(∆ρxx(T )/ρxx) expected to hold
for kF l >> 1. Along with the anomalous T -dependence
and magnitudes of both ρxx and RH (T ), both these fea-
tures are inexplicable within WL views (where RH is
T -independent and non-critical at the MIT), and point
toward a fundamentally new mechanism at work. Two
possible reasons for this discord are: (1) electron-electron
(e − e) interactions, which grow near a disorder-induced
MIT, may destroy the one-electron picture and change
the transport behavior, and/or (2) such experiments
maybe probing the “strong” localization regime of a dis-
order problem, where non-perturbative eﬀects associated
with strong scattering may also destroy the one-electron
picture. This is because the pole-like structure in the one-
electron propagator is supplanted by a branch-cut contin-
uum structure at “strong” localization, where kF l ≤ 1,
and thus any (1/kF l)-expansion underlying Boltzmann
approaches is untenable at the outset.

Motivated by the above issues, we investigate magneto-
transport near a continuous (at T = 0) MIT. While
the classic correlation-driven Mott transitions are al-
ways ﬁrst-order, disorder-driven MITs (in both, weak-
and strong-scattering pictures) are genuinely quantum-

critical (see Ref. [7] for a rather detailed review of weak
localization (WL) along with extensive comparison with
data up to 1985). We choose the Falicov-Kimball model
because (i) it is the simplest model exhibiting a contin-
uous MIT, (ii) is exactly soluble within (cluster) dynam-
ical mean-ﬁeld theory ((C)DMFT) for arbitrarily strong
interaction, and (iii) thus treats the all-important short-
range correlations precisely on the length scale of l ≃ k−1
F .
Moreover, it is isomorphic to the binary-alloy Ander-
son disorder model, and thus is ideally suited to study
“strong” localization. The Hamiltonian is

and dispersion less (d) states, t is the one-electron hop-
ping integral and U is the onsite repulsion for a site-
local doubly occupied conﬁguration. Since ni,d = 0, 1,
vi = U ni,d is also viewed as a static “disorder” potential
for the c-fermions.

We have analyzed the continuous MIT [11] and its asso-
ciated quantum-critical scaling in the dc resistivity [12] in
earlier works. As for the resistivity, we now use the exact-
to-O(1/D) cluster propagators GK(ω) for each of the 2-
site cluster momenta K = (0, 0), (π, π) to compute the
full conductivity tensor, σab(T ), with a, b = x, y. Rigor-
ous vanishing of the irreducible vertex corrections to the
Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for all the intra-cluster
momenta [13] greatly facilitates this task, allowing an
exact-to-O(1/D) computation of transport co-eﬃcients.

MIT occurring at (U/t)c = 1.8 [11]. A clear change of
slope (for T < 0.05t) occurs around (U/t) = 1.3, and
σxy(T ) ≃ T 1.2 around (U/t)c. It is noteworthy that the
dc resistivity ρxx(T ) shows extremely bad-metallic be-
havior at lowest T , beautiful mirror symmetry and novel
“Mott-like” scaling [12] precisely in this regime. It is ob-
viously of interest to inquire whether the novel features
seen in ρxx(U/t, T ) can also be reﬂected in magneto-
transport near the “Mott” QCP. To facilitate this pos-
sibility, we show log10( σxy
σxy(T ) ) versus T in Fig.2, ﬁnding
that the family of 1/σxy(U/t, T ) curves also exhibit a
near-perfect “mirror” symmetry over an extended region
around 1/σxy
(c)(U/t, T ), strongly presaging quantum crit-
ical behavior. To unearth this feature, we also show
log10( σxy
in the right panel of Fig.2,
where we have repeated the unbiased method of intro-
ducing a T xy
0 (U/t) to rescale all metallic and insulat-
ing curves on to two universal curves. Remarkably, as
for the ρxx-scaling, we ﬁnd, as shown in Fig.3, that T xy
0
vanishes precisely at the MIT. Clear scaling behavior we
thus obtain testiﬁes to a remarkable fact: the novel scal-
ing features found earlier in dc resistivity are also clearly
manifest in the oﬀ-diagonal resistivity.

varies as ln(gxy), and is continuous through δU = 0. This
shows that it has precisely the same form on both sides
of the MIT, which is exactly the feature needed for gen-
uine quantum criticality. These features resemble those
found for QC scaling in ρxx [12], showing that, like β(g),
γ(gxy) ≃ln(gxy) deep into the metallic phase. Thus, we
have found that the full dc conductivity tensor reﬂects
the strong coupling nature of the “Mott” QCP, attest-
ing to its underlying non-perturbative origin in Mott-like
(strong scattering) physics.

That γ(gxy) ≃ lngxy holds on both sides of the MIT im-
plies that its two branches must display “mirror symme-
try” over an extended range of gxy. In Fig.3, left panel,
we indeed see that magneto-transport around the QCP
exhibits well-developed reﬂection symmetry (bounded by
dashed vertical lines), It is also manifest in the right panel
of Fig.3, where σxy
c ; i.e, they
are mapped onto each other under reﬂection around Uc,
precisely as found earlier for the dc resistivity. Thus, our
study explicitly shows the novel quantum criticality in
magneto-transport at the “Mott” QCP in the FKM or
binary-alloy Anderson disorder problem in the “strong”
localization limit.

Scaling of σxy within WL framework is long known [9].
To put our ﬁndings in context and to bare their novel un-
derlying nature, we ﬁrst observe that we ﬁnd T xy

in the right panel of Fig.4, we also show that
σxy = σ0,xy(Uc − U )µ′

from ν ≃ 4/3 found earlier for σxx(U ). Along with
our ﬁnding of σxx(T ) ≃ T and σxy(T ) ≃ T 1.2 at the
MIT, these ﬁndings have very interesting consequences:
(i) in stark contrast to WL predictions, the Hall con-
stant is critical at the MIT. We ﬁnd R−1
xx/σxy ≃
(Uc − U )0.8, in strong contrast to the WL prediction,
[9] at the MIT, (ii) RH is

also strongly T -dependent and divergent at the MIT,
varying like RH (T ) ≃ T −0.8, whereas RH ≃ (nec)−1
in WL theory. Concomitantly, the Hall angle also ex-
hibits anomalous behavior: (iii) tanθH (T ) ≃ T 0.2 and
tanθH (U ) ≃ (Uc − U )1/2 in the quantum critical region.
What are the microscopic underpinnings of our ﬁnd-
ings? In WL theory [9], RH = (nec)−1 is T -independent
and non-critical at the MIT. In the metallic phase, use
of semiclassical ideas dictates that both β(g) and γ(gxy)
scale like (d − 2) − A/g, and the quantum correction to
the Hall conductance is twice as big as for the Ohmic
conductance. The stringent assumption under which

this holds is that the inverse Hall constant (related to
h(L) = Ld−2/RHB in Abrahams et al.)
scales clas-
sically like h(L) ≃ Ld−2 for small B (large h).
It is
precisely this assumption that breaks down in the non-
perturbative regime in CDMFT, where RH is critical at
the MIT (see above). This is thus the deeper reason for
departure from WL predictions we ﬁnd in the kF l ≤ 1
regime. In Fig.6, we show RH (U/t, T ) (left panel) and
fxy(U/t, T ) = d[logRH ]
d[log(T )] versus T (right panel). Both are
indeed markedly T -dependent, in stark contrast to WL
theory, where RH is non-critical and fxy = 0. Ultimately,
these results are a consequence of the fact that the Lan-
dau pole structure in the one-electron propagators in WL
theory is supplanted by an infra-red branch-cut contin-
uum at strong coupling, rendering semiclassical scaling
inapplicable at the outset.

We are now able to qualitatively address known ex-
perimental cases which are at odds with conventional
WL predictions. Speciﬁcally, in two earlier studies, both
σxy and R−1
H were found to diverge at the MIT with
critical exponents ν′ = 1.1, νH = 0.69 for GeSb [8] and
νH = 0.44(±0.04) for Si:P [15]. Importantly, these val-
ues violate the WL prediction of ν′ = 2ν (ν the critical
exponent for the dc conductivity) and νH = 0. Our ﬁnd-
ing of ν = 1.3, ν′ = 1.8, νH = 0.8 are in good qualitative
accord with (D = 3) GeSb. Comparison with Si:P is pre-
mature, since e − e interaction eﬀects near the MIT need

to be considered there. However, our analysis may apply
for systems modeled well by an eﬀective FKM, namely
NbN [10], TaxN [16] and other similar binary “alloy”
systems in the strong scattering regime, and we suggest
that careful examination of magneto-transport anomalies
across the MIT in such cases would be fruitful.

To conclude, we have presented clear evidence of novel
quantum critical behavior in magneto-transport near a
continuous Mott transition by a careful scaling analysis of
CDMFT results for the oﬀ-diagonal conductivity for the
FKM (or binary-alloy Anderson disorder model) in the
strong localization limit. In contrast to WL approaches
valid for weak disorder and kF l >> 1, we ﬁnd that the
loss of the quasiparticle pole structure at strong coupling
(kF l ≃ 1) leads to a rather distinct “Mott”-like quan-
tum criticality, necessitating abandonment of the qua-
siclassical Drude-Boltzmann transport schemes to study
(magneto)-transport. The resulting quantum criticality
we ﬁnd is closer to that expected from the opposite limit
of strong localization based on a real-space locator ex-
pansion [17, 18], as manifested in γ(gxy) ≃ ln(gxy). We
suggest that strongly disordered electronic systems that
show a bad-metallic resistivity and sizable T -dependent
Hall constant would be promising candidates to unearth
such novel quantum-critical magneto-transport at a con-
tinuous MIT. Finally, the strong coupling QC scaling in
resistivity in earlier work [12] and its similarity to the
Mott QC scaling in the Hubbard model [19] now calls
for investigation into such features in wider classes of
strongly correlated Mott materials above the critical end-
point of the line of ﬁrst-order MITs.
