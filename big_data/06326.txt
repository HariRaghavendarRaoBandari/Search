Abstract

The CMS collaboration has reported a possible lepton ﬂavour violating (LFV) signal
h → µτ . Whereas this does not happen in the standard model (SM), we point out that
new physics responsible for this type of decay would, in general, also produce charge-parity
(CP) violation in h → τ τ . We estimate the size of this eﬀect in a model independent
manner and ﬁnd that a large asymmetry, of order 40%, is allowed by current constraints.

Within the SM the tau-lepton coupling to the Higgs boson is uniquely deter-

mined by its mass. The Yukawa Lagrangian for leptons reads

LY = yij ¯ℓLi eRjφ + h.c.

(1)

Here ℓLi is the left handed SM lepton doublet, eRj the right handed lepton singlet,
φ is the scalar Higgs doublet and i, j = 1, 2, 3 are generation indices. The leptons
acquire a mass when electroweak symmetry is broken and the Higgs ﬁeld develops a

vacuum expectation value (vev) hφi = v/√2, v ≈ 246 GeV. Eq. (1) then takes the

form

Lhτ τ = (cid:18)1 +

h

v(cid:19) yijv
√2

¯eLi eRj + h.c.

(2)

The Yukawa Lagrangian in the lepton mass eigenstate basis is obtained from Eq.
e(vyij/√2)Te = miδij. In this basis the hℓℓ′
(2) with a bi-unitary transformation S†
couplings are given by ghℓiℓj = miδij/v. They are thus proportional to the lepton
masses, ﬂavour diagonal and real and therefore CP conserving.

Beyond the standard model (BSM), however, this no longer holds. In a model
independent manner we can describe new physics with an eﬀective Lagrangian that
respects the symmetries of the SM. Identifying the 125 GeV state observed at LHC
as the SM Higgs, and assuming that there are no new particles below a few hundred
GeV, the appropriate eﬀective Lagrangian for BSM physics is that of Buchmuller
and Wyler [1, 2]. At leading order, with operators of dimension six, one already
ﬁnds terms in the Lagrangian that modify Eq. (1), for example,

L6 =

gij
Λ2 (φ†φ)¯ℓLi eRj φ + h.c.

(3)

The matrix gij is, in general, non-diagonal and complex. Expanding this Lagrangian
after electroweak symmetry breaking in combination with Eq. (1) we ﬁnd,

Lhτ τ = (cid:18)1 +

remains an arbitrary complex matrix. This can be easily checked, for example using
the Fritzsch ansatz [3, 4] for the yij and treating the gij as small corrections as

suggested by the prefactor v2/Λ2. To relate the magnitudes of h → τ µ and h → τ τ
one needs a speciﬁc model for the gij matrix, this eﬀective Lagrangian tells us that
both are expected with a common suppression factor relative to the SM terms.

It has become customary to parametrize deviations from the SM in the tau-

lepton Yukawa coupling as

ghτ τ = −

mτ
v

h¯τ (rτ + i˜rτ γ5) τ

(7)

and if the deviations are small to further write rτ = 1 + ǫτ . In terms of Eq. (6), and
writing (S†

egijTe) ≡ gτ τ eiα, then

ǫτ = cos α gτ τ

˜rτ = sin α gτ τ

Under the assumption of small deviations from the SM, the Universal Higgs ﬁt

[5] ﬁnds that

ǫτ = −0.03 ± 0.17

The lepton-ﬂavor violating couplings can also be read oﬀ Eq. (6) as

ghτ µ,hµτ =

v2

√2Λ2 (cid:0)S†

egijTe(cid:1)32,23 .

These couplings have been studied in connection with the CMS report [6]

B(h → µτ ) = (0.84+0.39

−0.37)%

(9)

(10)

(11)

with the resulting constraint qg2

hµτ < 3.6 × 10−3. LFV Higgs decays have
been discussed using the eﬀective Lagrangian framework by a number of authors
[7–10]. Comparing Eq. (10) with Eq. (8) and assuming the elements of gij are of
the same order of magnitude this implies that

hτ µ + g2

ǫτ ∼ ˜rτ . 0.35

(12)

which is less restrictive than Eq. (9). One can also assume that the matrix gij is of

the Fritzsch type [3, 9], in which case g23/g33 ∼ pmµ/mτ and the result would be

less restrictive by a factor of four.

It is also possible to constrain these couplings from the measurement of the

h → τ τ rate. From CMS [11] and ATLAS [12] we have

µ ≡

σ(h → τ τ )
σ(h → τ τ )SM

= 0.9 ± 0.28 CMS
= 1.43+0.43
−0.37 ATLAS

(13)

This can be compared with the rate calculated from the eﬀective Lagrangian. With

βτ = p1 − 4m2

τ /m2

h we ﬁnd

(14)

We plot the resulting constraint in Figure 1 and compare it to the one from Eq. (9).
The ﬁgure shows that these constraints still allow the quantity (rτ ˜rτ )/(r2
τ ) to
take its maximum value of 0.5.

straints in Eq. (13). The black dashed region illustrates the global ﬁt result from Eq. (9).
The diagonal blue line shows the maximum value of (rτ ˜rτ )/(r2

τ ) = 0.5.

τ + ˜r2

It is well known that the simultaneous existence of scalar and pseudo-scalar
couplings to a fermion pair as in Eq. (7) signals CP violation. The consequences
of these couplings for the τ lepton to Higgs have been analyzed some time ago
[13]. In the standard treatment of this problem, one can deﬁne a density matrix
R for production of polarized tau-leptons with polarization described by a unit
polarization vector nτ (¯τ ) in the τ (¯τ )-rest frame. With the amplitude in Eq. (7) the
CP violating part of the density matrix is given by

RCP = −Nβτ Re(rτ ˜rτ )~pτ · (nτ × n¯τ ) ,

(15)

where N is a normalization constant and ~pτ is the three momentum direction of the
tau-lepton. Beyond tree-level, rτ and ˜rτ acquire imaginary parts and the density
matrix has additional terms that we will not consider in this paper. RCP contains
all the information about experimental observables with the weak decay of the tau-
leptons analyzing their polarization.

The simplest mode to consider is the two body decay

τ − → π−ντ , τ + → π+ ¯ντ .

(16)

Denoting ~pπ± as the three- momenta of the pions in the Higgs rest frame, a T-odd
correlation sensitive to CP violation is given by

This can be measured by the integrated counting asymmetry

Oπ = ~pτ · (~pπ+ × ~pπ−).

Aπ =

N(Oπ > 0) − N(Oπ < 0)

The three body leptonic decay τ ± → ℓ±ν ¯ν can also be calculated analytically

in the limit mτ << mH, βτ → 1 and mℓ << mτ . The T-odd correlation

Oℓ = ~pτ · (~pℓ+ × ~pℓ−),

(19)

where now ~pℓ± denotes the three-momenta of the charged lepton in the Higgs rest
frame, can be measured with the integrated counting asymmetry

Aℓ =

rτ ˜rτ

|rτ|2 + |˜rτ|2 .

(20)

Although the calculation for the two modes discussed so far can be carried out
analytically, it is convenient to implement Eq. (7) in MADGRAPH5 [14] with the aid
of FEYNRULES [15]. This allows us to verify numerically the results of Eqs. (18) and
(20). It will also allow us to discuss more complicated tau decay modes in a future
publication.

Combined with the limits discussed in Section I, Eq. (18) shows that a very
large asymmetry, of order 40% is still allowed. Of course there are many eﬀects that
will reduce this asymmetry at LHC. The results of a recent detailed study of the
sensitivity of LHC to ˜rτ ﬁnds that it can be determined with an uncertainty of .25
(.15) with 150 (500) fb−1 [16].
