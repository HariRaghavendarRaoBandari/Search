Active (i.e., self-propelled or swimming) particles moving through an isotropic ﬂuid exhibit con-
ventional diﬀusive behavior. We report anomalous diﬀusion of an active particle moving in an
anisotropic, nematic background. Whilst the translational motion parallel to the nematic direc-
tor shows ballistic behavior, the long-time transverse motion is super-diﬀusive, with an anomalous
scaling ∝ t ln t of the mean squared displacement with time t. This behavior is predicted by an an-
alytical theory that we present here, and is corroborated by numerical simulation of active particle
diﬀusion in a simple lattice model for a nematic liquid crystal. It is universal for any collection of
self-propelled elements (e.g., bacteria or active rods) moving in a nematic background, provided only
that the swimmers are suﬃciently dilute that their interactions with each other can be neglected,
and that they do not perform “hairpin” turns.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The physics of microswimmers is a ﬂourishing re-
search ﬁeld, which has enriched our understanding of
non-equilibrium emergent phenomena, and could lead
to many applications, such as controlled particle separa-
tion and self-assembly. By and large, most artiﬁcial mi-
croswimmers considered so far are embedded in a simple
Newtonian ﬂuid at low Reynolds number [1–5]. Many mi-
croorganisms in their natural environment, however, are
exposed to much more complex media, which are more
appropriately described by complex non-Newtonian ﬂu-
ids [6, 7]. Examples range from the motion of cilia and
spermatozoa in mucus [8, 9] to bacteria in the host tissue
[10] and nematodes migrating though soil [11]. Recent ef-
forts aimed at gaining a better understanding of the role
of the complex environment involve studying microswim-
ming in non-Newtonian solvents such as viscoelastic ﬂu-
ids [6, 12–20], in liquid crystalline environments [19, 21–
27], in the presence of random [28] or patterned [29] ob-
stacles, or in crystalline [30–32] media.

Motivated by recent experiments on “living liquid crys-
tals” (i.e., bacteria swimming in a nematic background)
[21, 24, 33], we study here a swimmer in a nematic liq-
uid crystalline solvent, when the swimming direction is
coupled to the local nematic director suﬃciently strongly
to prevent hairpin turns by the swimmer. The nematic
background is anisotropic, with a macroscopic nematic
director; allowing the swimmer motion to be decomposed
into components parallel and perpendicular to the ne-
matic director. Our interest is in determining the eﬀects
of thermal nematic director ﬂuctuations on the swim-
mer’s motion.

∗ jjt@oregon.edu

We develop a hydrodynamic theory that describes the
universal behavior of a swimmer with only a short term
memory, and any coupling to the nematic director that
tends to locally align its motion along that director. The
only limitation of the theory is that it excludes hairpin
turns; since these will be very rare for any appreciable
coupling of the swimmer velocity to the director, this is
not a serious limitation of the theory.

Our theory predicts that the mean displacement ∆r(cid:107)
parallel to the nematic director shows ballistic behavior,
that is, the mean parallel displacement behaves as

(cid:104)∆r(cid:107)(t)(cid:105) ∝ t

,

(1)

while the long-time transverse motion is super-diﬀusive,
with an anomalous scaling

(cid:104)|∆r⊥ (t)|2(cid:105) ∝ t ln t

,

(2)

of the mean squared displacement with time t. These
predictions are corroborated by numerical simulation of a
model in which the nematic background is represented by
“Lebwohl-Lasher” spins on a lattice, to which the swim-
mer is not conﬁned.

This superdiﬀusive behavior is the signature of a new
universality class of active diﬀusion, and provides a dra-
matic demonstration of how radically the behavior of
an active system can diﬀer from its equilibrium counter-
parts: even adding a single active element to an otherwise
entirely equilibrium system completely change the scaling
of diﬀusion. Note further that this change of scaling is an
inevitable consequence of the activity; furthermore, the
new scaling that results is universal: it will occur for any
swimmer in any otherwise equilibrium nematic, provided
only that our very general and plausible assumption of
spatiotemporal locality is met.

II. HYDRODYNAMIC THEORY

We will consider a self-propelled swimmer moving
through an otherwise equilibrium, ordered uniaxial ne-
matic. This swimmer has no memory, or, at best, only a
short term memory, of its past direction of motion. Fur-
thermore, the dynamics of the entire system (nematic
plus swimmer) are rotation invariant: that is, the swim-
mer carries no internal “compass”; any preference it ex-
hibits for one direction of motion over any other must
arise from the local nematic director ˆn(rs(t)) at the cur-
rent location rs(t) of the swimmer. This requirement of
locality arises from the physically reasonable assumption
that the interactions of the swimmer with the surround-
ing nematic are short-ranged in space.

The average value of

the instantaneous velocity
drs(t)/dt of such a swimmer must be along ˆn(rs(t)); rota-
tion invariance plus locality allow no other direction (ex-
cept −ˆn(rs(t)); we will discuss this option below). Hence,
the instantaneous velocity drs(t)/dt must be given by

drs(t)

dt

= vsˆn(rs(t), t) + f (t) ,

(3)

director becomes

general, satisfy any kind of ﬂuctuation-dissipation theo-
rem; they are independent parameters.

To complete our description, we need to specify the
dynamics of ˆn. In our simulations, we discretize space
into a simple cubic lattice, with sites labeled by i, and
take the dynamics of the director far from the swimmer
to be purely relaxational and equilibrium; that is,

dˆni(t)

dt

= −Γ

∂H
∂ˆni

+ ζi(t) ,

(6)

where the Hamiltonian H is the discrete Lebwohl-Lasher
model [34] on a simple cubic lattice of lattice constant a

H = −ε

(7)

<ij>

where P(x) = (3x2−1)/2 is the second Legendre polyno-
mial and ε is a coupling parameter setting the strength
of the aligning interactions (considering nearest neigh-
bors only).

In the continuum limit, this equation of motion for the

where the continuum Hamiltonian for an equilibrium ne-
matic is, in general, the well-known Frank free energy

d3r[K1 (∇ · ˆn)2 + K2 (ˆn · (∇ × ˆn))2
+K3 |ˆn × (∇ × ˆn)|2 + λ(r)|ˆn|2] ,

(9)

where K1,2,3 are the splay, twist, and bend Frank elastic
constants, respectively, and λ(r) is a Lagrange multiplier
that enforces the constraint |ˆn| = 1. For the special case
of the Lebwohl-Lasher model, all three Frank constants
are equal: K1 = K2 = K3 ≡ K(T ), and, as temperature
T → 0, K(T → 0) → 3ε/a [36].

Since the nematic itself, in the absence of the swimmer,
is an equilibrium system, the noise ζ in Eq. (8) must obey
the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem, which implies:

(cid:104)ζα(r, t)ζβ(r(cid:48), t(cid:48))(cid:105) = 2ΓkBT δαβδ3(r − r(cid:48))δ(t − t(cid:48)) .(10)
The dynamics we have just described are a simpliﬁcation
of those of real bulk nematics [37]; those real dynamics
are complicated by the coupling of the nematic director
to background ﬂuid ﬂow. Nonetheless, the two features
of the dynamics which are essential to our calculations,
namely i) that equal time correlations are given by the
Boltzmann weight associated with the Frank free energy
Eq. (9), and ii) that the dynamics are purely diﬀusive,
persist in real nematics. The only diﬀerence is that in real
nematics, there are two coupled shear ﬂow-nematoelastic
diﬀusive modes, rather than the single mode that occurs
in our model. This diﬀerence aﬀects none of our results
on anomalous diﬀusion at all, as will become clear when
we analyze our model. Furthermore, the true director

s , where v0

where f (t) is a zero mean random ﬂuctuation in the ve-
locity, and vs is the mean speed of the swimmer. Note
that in general vs (cid:54)= v0
s is the “bare”, or in-
stantaneous, speed of the swimmer, due to the eﬀects of
ﬂuctuations. Indeed, in general, we expect vs < v0
s . In
practice, vs can only be determined by measuring the
mean motion of the swimmer over long times; this will
be discussed in more detail below.

The statistics of the ﬂuctuations f are also almost com-
pletely determined by the requirements of rotation in-
variance and locality in space and time.
In a “coarse-
grained” theory, in which we imagine having averaged
our dynamics over time scales long compared to the time
of individual molecular “kicks” experienced by the swim-
mer, but short compared to the time scales we wish to
investigate, f can be thought of as a sum of a large num-
ber of random molecular kicks at diﬀerent microscopic
times, which are therefore statistically independent. The
central limit theorem then tells us that the statistics of
f should be Gaussian. Its statistics are then completely
speciﬁed by its two point correlations with the local ne-
matic director ˆn(r, t) and itself; rotation invariance and
spatio-temporal locality imply that these are given by:
(cid:104)fα(t)fβ(t(cid:48))(cid:105) = 2∆I δαβδ(t − t(cid:48)) + 2∆Anα(rs(t), t)

× nβ(rs(t), t)δ(t − t(cid:48)) ,

and

(cid:104)fα(t)nβ(rs(t(cid:48)), t(cid:48))(cid:105) = 2∆f nδαβδ(t − t(cid:48)) ,

where α and β are Cartesian indices, and ∆I , ∆A, and
∆f n are phenomenological parameters which set the size
of the ﬂuctuations of the swimmer. Because the swimmer
is a non-equilibrium agent, these parameters do not, in

(4)

(5)

dynamics of real nematics simpliﬁes to our model when
inertial eﬀects are negligible which they are whenever
the dimensionless parameter κ ≡ K/ρν2 (cid:28) 1, where ν
is a typical kinematic shear viscosity (of which there are
three in a nematic, due to its anisotropy), K the largest
of the Frank constants, and ρ the mass density of the
nematic. In this limit, the shear ﬂow mode and director
realignment decouple, and the director dynamics is de-
scribed precisely by a slightly anisotropic version of our
model with kinetic coeﬃcient Γ = 1/ρν. For most exper-
imentally known nematics, κ (cid:46) 10−4 [37], so this is an
excellent approximation.

We expect the eﬀect of the swimmer on the nematic
to be negligible, because it is purely local, while the long
time behavior of the swimmer is, as we will see, deter-
mined by the long distance correlations of ˆn.
In our
simulations, we check this by including interactions be-
tween the swimmer and the director that locally realign
the director as well as the swimmer. As expected, we ﬁnd
that, as we just argued, such swimmer induced director
realignments do not aﬀect our results, in the sense that
the theory presented here, which ignores them, recovers
the observed anomalous diﬀusive behavior of the lateral
motion of the swimmer.

Our complete hydrodynamic theory is thus embodied
in equations of motion Eq. (3) and Eq. (8) for the swim-
mer and the nematic director, respectively, supplemented
by the expressions Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) for the two point
correlations of the Gaussian random velocity, and by the
Frank free energy Eq. (9) for the energetics of the nematic
director.

Thus, the behavior of the swimmer is completely spec-
iﬁed by four equilibrium parameters: the temperature
T , the three Frank constants K1,2,3, and the direc-
tor kinetic coeﬃcient Γ, as well as four fundamentally
non-equilibrium parameters associated with the swim-
mer: the mean swimming speed vs, and the three non-
equilibrium noise strengths ∆I ,∆A,∆f n, and D. As we
shall see, the anomalous diﬀusion is determined entirely
by one combination of vs, T , K1,2, and is independent
of the bend Frank constant K3 and of all of the non-
equilibrium parameters except the swimming speed vs.
Since the form of Eq. (3), Eq. (8), Eq. (4), Eq. (5), and
Eq. (9) are dictated by symmetry and spatio-temporal
locality, they are completely universal; that is, they de-
scribe any swimmer in any nematic. This implies in turn
that the conclusions we are about to draw from these
equations, in particular, that the swimmer exhibits su-
perdiﬀusive lateral motion, are universal as well.

There is, however, one limitation on our equations:
they exclude “hairpin turns”. These are ﬂuctuations in
which the swimmer reverses its direction of motion rela-
tive to the local nematic director (that is, where it makes
an angle of more than 90o with the director. Such turns
are important because of the nematic symmetry of the
background nematic, whose implications we will now dis-
cuss.

The nematic phase is apolar; that is, in it, although

3

the long axes of the molecules align, their heads and tails
do not. This means that reversing the nematic director
- i.e., taking ˆn → −ˆn - cannot change anything physical.
Our fundamental equation of motion Eq. (3) obviously
violates this symmetry. There is, however, a natural way
to eliminate this arbitrariness of the sign of ˆn: we can
simply choose the sign of ˆn at every point to be such
that it makes an angle of less than 180◦ with the initial
direction of the swimmer’s velocity.

However, nematic symmetry also implies our equation
of motion Eq. (3) cannot continue to hold once the swim-
mer makes a “hairpin” turn: that is, once its direction of
motion makes an angle of more than > 90◦ with the local
nematic director ˆn. Rather, since, in a nematic state, the
swimming velocity can only align with the nematic axis,
we would expect that, once a hairpin turn has occurred,
the swimmer will now seek to align, not with ˆn as de-
ﬁned above, but with −ˆn. An extension of our model
to allow for this eﬀect ﬁnds that all of the behavior we
ﬁnd below will be cut oﬀ for t (cid:29) thairpin, where thairpin
is the mean time between hairpin turns. This argument
is discussed in detail in Appendix B. Fortunately, this
time thairpin can be made exponentially long: we would
expect it to scale like exp(∆E/kBT ), where ∆E is the
height of the “energy barrier” against a reversal of the
swimmer direction of motion (that is, the energy cost
of the swimmer making an angle of 90o with the local
nematic axis). This can therefore be made very long
in a model simply by making ∆E (cid:29) kBT , as we have
done in our simulations which we will specify in the sub-
sequent paragraph.
Indeed, we have never observed a
hairpin turn in our simulations. More importantly, we
also expect that, deep within the nematic phase and for
a strongly aligned swimmer, ∆E (cid:29) kBT , so hairpins
should be rare, if not non-existent, in many real exper-
iments as well. Hairpin turns can also be avoided by
considering not a self-propelled particle, but a sediment-
ing one: that is, a particle whose motion is driven by an
external force, like gravity, or electric or magnetic ﬁelds.
This also gives one the option of studying motion that
is directed in a diﬀerent direction than that of nematic
alignment. We will discuss this interesting problem in a
future publication.

We now proceed to analyze the implications of this the-
ory for the motion of the swimmer. We’ll start with the
mean motion. Taking the average of Eq. (3), and recall-
ing that (cid:104)f(cid:105) = 0, we immediately obtain an expression
for the mean position of the swimmer:
(cid:104)rs(t)(cid:105) = vst(cid:104)ˆn(cid:105) ≡ vztˆz ,

(11)

where we have taken the mean direction of the nematic
director ˆn to be along ˆz, and the mean swimmer speed
in the z direction is given by vz = vs|(cid:104)ˆn(cid:105)| Thus, the
mean motion of the swimmer is purely ballistic. The
speed vz of this motion can not be determined by the
continuum theory used here, since ﬂuctuations of the di-
rector away from ˆz, which reduce (cid:104)ˆn(cid:105) below 1, are, in
three dimensions, dominated by short-wavelength ﬂuctu-

ations, which are not accurately described by the contin-
uum, long-wavelength Frank free energy Eq. (9). This
domination by short wavelengths can be seen by noting
that, roughly speaking, the mean squared ﬂuctuations
in Fourier space (cid:104)|n⊥(q)|2(cid:105) of the components of the di-
rector perpendicular to ˆz predicted by the Boltzmann
weight associated with the Frank free energy Eq. (9) obey
(cid:104)|n⊥(q)|2(cid:105) ∝ 1/q2. Since the q space volume in a spher-
ical shell q0 ≤ |q ≤ 2q0 scales like q3
0 in d = 3, while
the typical (cid:104)|n⊥(q)|2(cid:105) in that shell scales like 1/q2
0, the
total contribution of such a shell to the mean squared
real space ﬂuctuations (cid:104)|n⊥(r)|2(cid:105), which contribution is

d3q(cid:10)|n⊥ (q, t)|2(cid:11), grows lin-

proportional to (cid:82)

q0≤|q|≤2q0

early with q0. That is, regions of larger q (i.e., smaller
wavelength 1/|q|) contribute more to (cid:104)|n⊥(r)|2(cid:105) than re-
gions of smaller q. Hence, we can not compute these
ﬂuctuations from a long wavelength theory. We therefore
cannot compute (cid:104)ˆn(cid:105), and, therefore, cannot compute vz.
We must instead take it as yet another phenomenologi-
cal parameter of our model. Equivalently, if we incorpo-
rate short wavelength eﬀects by introducing an ultravio-
let cutoﬀ Λ to our wavevector integrals, the value of (cid:104)ˆn(cid:105),
and, therefore, of vz, will depend on Λ, which is another
parameter.

Nonetheless, we have still made a universal scaling pre-
diction: the mean motion of the swimmer is ballistic, as

shown by Eq. (11).

4

We now turn to the ﬂuctuations about this mean. Con-
sider ﬁrst the mean squared lateral displacement of the
swimmer:

s (t))2(cid:105) ≡(cid:68)(cid:12)(cid:12)r⊥

(cid:104)(∆r⊥

s (t) − r⊥

s (0)(cid:12)(cid:12)2(cid:69)

perpendicular to the mean director of the nematic. Here
and throughout this paper, ⊥ and z denote directions
perpendicular to, and along, the nematic director, re-
spectively.

Using the projection of our equation of motion Eq. (3)
perpendicular to the mean nematic direction ˆz, which
reads

(13)

Integrating Eq. (13) gives

∆r⊥

s (t) ≡ r⊥

s (t) − r⊥

s (0) =

Squaring this, and averaging, we ﬁnd that (cid:104)(∆r⊥
given by

dt(cid:48) (vsn⊥(rs, t(cid:48)) + f⊥ (t(cid:48))) .
(14)

.(15)

Using the expressions Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) for the two-
point correlations of the Gaussian random velocity, we
can immediately evaluate the last two terms, denoted by
I2 and I3, respectively. The ﬁrst of them is

I2 =

dt(cid:48)(cid:48)2vs (cid:104)n⊥(rs(t(cid:48)), t(cid:48)) · f⊥(t(cid:48)(cid:48))(cid:105) = 6∆f nt

while the second is

dt(cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:104)f⊥ (t(cid:48)) · f⊥ (t(cid:48)(cid:48))(cid:105) = [6∆I + 2∆A] t

(17)
Both of these terms are extremely boring: their contribu-
tion to the mean squared lateral wandering (cid:104)(∆r⊥
s (t))2(cid:105)
is simply conventionally diﬀusive: that is, proportional to
time t. The anomalous diﬀusion that we predict comes
entirely from the ﬁrst term in Eq. (15):

(cid:90) t

dt(cid:48)(cid:48) (cid:104)n⊥(rs(t(cid:48)), t(cid:48)) · n⊥(rs(t(cid:48)(cid:48)), t(cid:48)(cid:48))(cid:105) .

(18)

Because the nematic dynamics are invariant under space
and time translations, the general director two point cor-
relation function depends only on the diﬀerences of the

space and time coordinates; that is

C⊥ ≡ (cid:104)n⊥(r(cid:48), t(cid:48)) · n⊥(r(cid:48)(cid:48), t(cid:48)(cid:48))(cid:105) = C⊥ (r(cid:48) − r(cid:48)(cid:48), t − t(cid:48))

(19)

Now in Eq. (18), we need this correlation function evalu-
ated when r(cid:48) = rs(t(cid:48)) and r(cid:48)(cid:48) = rs(t(cid:48)(cid:48)). These vectors are
given by:

.

(20)

s (t)

rs(t) = rs(0) + vstˆz + ∆r⊥

determined by its root mean squared value(cid:112)(cid:104)|∆r⊥

We will show a posteriori that the typical size of r⊥, as
s (t)|2(cid:105),
is always much less than vst as t → ∞. Therefore, since
C⊥ (r(cid:48) − r(cid:48)(cid:48), t − t(cid:48)) is a roughly isotropic function of the
relative position vector r(cid:48) − r(cid:48)(cid:48)
s [35] [38] we can neglect its
r⊥
s component in Eq. (18). This leads to the simplifying
approximation

rs(t(cid:48)) − rs(t(cid:48)(cid:48)) ≈ vs(t(cid:48) − t(cid:48)(cid:48))ˆz .

(21)

Furthermore, because of the slow (diﬀusive) dynamics of
the nematic, we can neglect t − t(cid:48) as well. To see this,
note that C⊥ (r(cid:48) − r(cid:48)(cid:48), t − t(cid:48)) can only change substan-
tially from its value at t − t(cid:48) = 0 when t − t(cid:48) is large
enough for diﬀusion to occur from r(cid:48) to r(cid:48)(cid:48). This requires

(cid:112)D|t(cid:48) − t(cid:48)(cid:48)| (cid:38) |r(cid:48) − r(cid:48)(cid:48)|, where D is the nematic diﬀusion

constant, which is given for our simple relaxational model
(8) by D = ΓK = K/ρν. We stress that the anisotropy
of the Frank free energy (9) when the Frank constants
K1,2,3 are unequal leads to anisotropic diﬀusion; this does
not, however, aﬀect the argument we are presenting here,
which depends only on the diﬀusive scaling, and holds
even for anisotropic diﬀusion. For the Lebwohl-Lasher
spin model, this diﬀusion constant D ∼ Ka3/ξ ∼ 3εa2/ξ,
where ε represents the spin-spin coupling strength and
ξ the spin rotational friction coeﬃcient (details will be
given in the next paragraph), while for real nematics,
it is given by D ∼ K/ρν. Using Eq. (21) in this con-
satisﬁed for small time diﬀerences |t(cid:48) − t(cid:48)(cid:48)|; speciﬁcally,
for |t(cid:48) − t(cid:48)(cid:48)| (cid:46) t0, where t0 = D/v2
s . On longer timescales,
i.e., |t(cid:48)− t(cid:48)(cid:48)| (cid:38) t0, the correlation function in Eq. (18) can
be replaced by its value at t(cid:48) − t(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0; that is, we can use
the equal-time correlation function

dition implies (cid:112)D|t(cid:48) − t(cid:48)(cid:48)| (cid:38) vs|t(cid:48) − t(cid:48)(cid:48)|, which is only

C⊥(δt) = (cid:104)n⊥ (vsδtˆz, 0) · n⊥ (0, 0)(cid:105)

,

(22)

where δt ≡ t(cid:48) − t(cid:48)(cid:48), in place of the full nematic corelation
in Eq. (18) for |t(cid:48) − t(cid:48)(cid:48)| (cid:38) t0.

This is very convenient, since equal-time correlations
can be calculated for the nematic simply using the
Boltzmann weight associated with the Frank free energy
Eq. (9). Expressing C⊥ in terms of its spatio-temporal
Fourier transform Eq. (24) gives

(cid:104)n⊥ (vsδtˆz, 0) · n⊥ (0, 0)(cid:105) =

Oddly, this doesn’t depend on K3. Even odder, it re-
mains ﬁnite and non-zero when K2,3 → ∞, which sug-
gests that the anomaly persists even in a smectic liquid
crystal. We have veriﬁed that this is true by treating the
smectic explicitly; the result is somewhat diﬀerent from
Eq. (26) for subtle reasons that we will discuss later, but
the essential phenomenon of anomalous diﬀusion persists.
Note that this decay of correlations is extremely slow;
it is this slow decay, as we will see in a moment, that
is responsible for the anomalous diﬀusion. What is hap-
pening here physically is that, although the swimmer has
no long term memory, the nematic does. This long term
nematic memory comes from the fact that the nematic
has Goldstone modes, which relax slowly; indeed, they
relax at a rate that vanishes as their length scale goes to
inﬁnity, which is why they can give rise to such a long
1/δt tail in their correlations.

It is important to note that this scaling law for C(δt)
only holds for δt large, since it is only for such times
that the hydrodynamic theory is valid. Thus, we are
not concerned with any apparent divergences at short
times that occur when Eq. (26) is inserted into Eq. (15).
Divergences as t → ∞ are real, on the other hand.

Eq. (28) is the fundamental result of this work.
Its
form clearly demonstrates how the combination of ac-
tivity (embodied in the swimming speed vs) and the

6

tive particle and the nematic background by a contin-
uous overdamped dynamics of the swimmer and a dis-
crete Lebwohl-Lasher lattice model for the nematic back-
ground. The bulk properties of the latter are well-known
in the absence of the swimmer involving an isotropic-
nematic (IN) phase transition.

The active particle is characterized by its center-of-
mass position rs and orientation vector ˆus which de-
scribes the swimming direction. The motion of the swim-
mer is prescribed by the overdamped Langevin equations:

dtrs = ζ−1
dtˆus = ξ−1

s F0ˆus
s (Ωs + ˆΩs) × ˆus

(29)
with {ζs, ξs} (eﬀective) translational and rotational fric-
tion factors, F0 an eﬀective active force. For most swim-
mers the translation ﬂuctuations exerted by the environ-
ment should be of minor importance compared to the ori-
entational noise the objects experience (due to e.g. ﬂagel-
lar motion) [39] and we shall neglect translational noise.
ˆΩs is an intrinsic Gaussian torque and Ωs an eﬀective
torque arising from the coupling of the swimmer to the
nematic medium. The nematic background is described
by a cubic lattice of ‘spins’ with positions {ri} and unit
vectors {ˆui} describing the spin orientations. The liquid
crystalline background is described within the discrete
Lebwohl-Lasher model [34, 40] on a simple cubic lattice
with the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (7).
We deﬁne the eﬀective temperature T ∗ = kBT /ε of the
liquid crystalline medium. The Lebwohl-Lasher model
exhibits a ﬁrst-order isotropic-nematic transition at an
eﬀective temperature T ∗ = 1.12 [41]. For the dynam-
ics of the individual classical spins {ˆui}, we also assume
overdamped Langevin-like dynamics resulting in:

dtˆui(t) = ξ−1(Ωi + Ωi,s + ˆΩi) × ˆui

(30)

with spin rotational friction ξ and ˆΩi a random torque,
for which we take the usual white noise characteristics
(cid:104) ˆΩα(cid:105) = 0 and (cid:104) ˆΩα(t) ˆΩβ(t(cid:48))(cid:105) = 2kBT ξδαβδ(t − t(cid:48)) to en-
sure that the system is kept at temperature T in the
absence of the swimmer. Here Ωi × ˆui = λiˆui − ∂H/∂ˆui
(the Lagrange multiplier λi enforces the ﬁxed length con-
straint |ˆui| = 1) denotes the torque exerted on spin i by
its nearest neighbors (denoted by(cid:104)j(cid:105)):

FIG. 1. Simulation snapshots showing diﬀusive trajectories of
an active particle embedded in a lattice liquid crystal of N =
503 Lebwohl-Lasher spins with color-coded orientations. Both
swimmer trajactories cover a time interval of τ = 500. The
bottom panels represent a cut-out of the total simulation box.
The boxes enveloping the trajectories are not to scale. The
left trajectory corresponds to persistent active diﬀusion along
the director of a nematic phase at temperature T ∗ = 0.33.
The swimmer performs no “hairpin” turns. The trajectory
on the right displays random diﬀusion of an active particle
moving in an isotropic phase at T ∗ = 5.

Goldstone mode ﬂuctuations of an otherwise equilib-
rium system (manifest in the appearance of kBT and the
Frank constants K1,2), leads to a fundamentally diﬀer-
ent scaling behavior of the random motion of the swim-
mer from that found in any equilibrium system, since
equilibrium systems will always exhibit diﬀusive behav-
s (t))2(cid:105) = Dst behavior, while our t ln t behavior
ior (cid:104)(∆r⊥
cannot be written in that form, unless one deﬁnes a time-
dependent ”renormalized diﬀusion coeﬃcient” Ds ∝ ln t
which, surprisingly, diverges as t → ∞.

What is particularly striking about our result is that
this radically diﬀerent non-equilibrium scaling is arising
due to the addition of a single non-equilibrium element
(the swimmer itself) to an otherwise entirely equilibrium
model. Indeed, even the rotational motion of the swim-
mer is eﬀectively equilibrium rotational diﬀusion plus
equilibrium alignment with the nematic director.
It is
only the self-propulsion (vs) that makes the system non-
equilibrium; yet this is suﬃcient to lead to an inﬁnite,
non-equilibrium renormalization of the diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient.

III. SIMULATION OF AN ACTIVE PARTICLE

IN A NEMATIC LIQUID CRYSTAL

We will now test the theoretical predictions by numer-
ical simulation. We model the coupled system of an ac-

Assuming that the total system is torque-free, we re-
quire that the torque exerted by the particle onto the
spins be of equal amplitude but opposite sign, so that

5000700-30Ωi,s = −Ωs. The function g(Rj) speciﬁes the depen-
dence of the swimmer-spin interaction on the distance
Rj between the spin j and the active particle. The func-
tion is taken to be an exponentially damped one, namely
g(r) = exp[−(r/σ)2] with a characteristic decay length
σ. The source of damping could stem from the non-
Newtonian nature of the liquid crystal solvent or the
presence of no-slip boundaries. The decay length σ is
typically larger than the lattice constant a such that dis-
cretization eﬀects can be ignored. Fixing εs = ε guaran-
tees a strong orientational coupling between the swimmer
and the director to the extent that tumbling events, char-
acterized by the swimmer orientation making a hairpin
turn, are extremely rare. This point is made explicit in
Appendix A.

By setting the lattice spacing a as the internal length
scale and deﬁning Dr = kBT /ξ as the spin rotational
diﬀusion coeﬃcient (not to be confused with the diﬀu-
sion constant for director reorientation D ∼ 3εa2/ξ), we
introduce dimensionless variables for time τ = tDr, ac-
tive force f0 = βF0a and torque ω = βΩ. The reduced
active force f0 is also called P´eclet number; its order of
magnitude follows from the typical thrust force of a mi-
croswimmer F0 ∼ 0.1 − 1 pN so that |f0| ∼ 101 − 103.
Therefore we arrive at reduced equations of motion:

dτ (rs/a) = ˜ζ−1
dτ ˆus = ˜ξ−1

s f0ˆus
s (ωs + ˆωs) × ˆus

(33)

and a similar equation of motion for the Lebwohl-Lasher
spins:

dτ ˆui = (ωi + ωi,s + ˆωi) × ˆui

(34)

We further introduced reduced friction coeﬃcients ˜ζs =
ζsa2/ξ and ˜ξs = ξs/ξ. If one assumes both for the swim-
mer and for the spins a spherical hydrodynamic shape
(for the Stokes friction in a molecular solvent) one can
approximate ˜ζs ≈ 4(cid:96)/3 and ˜ξs ≈ (cid:96)3 with (cid:96) denoting the
ratio between the hydrodynamic radii of the active par-
ticle and the spin. The hydrodynamic size asymmetry (cid:96)
sets the typical reorientation rate of the spin versus that
of the swimmer. Typically, (cid:96) > 1 for elongated swim-
mers.

The random torques correspond to Gaussian rotational

(36)

We reiterate that in the model the three Frank elastic
constants are equal and reach the limiting value ˜K =
Ka/ε → 3 at zero temperature [36]. Finite temperature
corrections have been quantiﬁed numerically in Ref. [42].
A reasonable ﬁt of the simulation data is obtained using
the following parameterization in terms of the ﬁrst two
nematic order parameters

˜K (cid:39) c22S2

2 + c24S2S4

(37)
with S2 = S = (cid:104)P2(ˆu · ˆn)(cid:105) and S4 = (cid:104)P4(ˆu · ˆn)(cid:105). The
coeﬃcients are c22 = 3.905 and c24 = −0.905. These
parameters reproduce the exact result for the zero tem-
perature case where both order parameters tend to unity.
We have numerically solved the coupled equations of
motion for the swimmer and the nematic medium by a
simple linearized scheme for Eq. (33) and Eq. (34) using
a suﬃciently small time-step δτ < 0.001. We thereby
generate trajectories for {ˆus(τ ), rs(τ ); ˆui(τ )} to perform
the averages. An equilibration run of duration ∆τ = 100
starting from a system of perfectly aligned spins with a
swimmer ﬁxed at the centre of the system is followed by
a production run with a mobile swimmer during which
statistics were gathered over a time interval of at least
∆τ = 5000. The system size is ﬁxed at N = 503 spins
with periodic boundary condition in all three directions.
Spontaneous director rotation can be avoided by random
spin ﬂips at initiation to minimize the net spin magneti-
zation [40].
The essential control parameters of our model are: i)
the eﬀective temperature T ∗ = (βε)−1 of the medium
which controls whether it is in an isotropic or nematic
state and, in the latter case, the strength of the nematic
director ﬂuctuations.
ii) The reduced active force (or
P´eclet number) f0 > 0. Provided suﬃciently large, this
parameter is of minor importance for the scaling proper-
ties of the swimmer mobility. iii) The range σ over which
the swimmer is inﬂuenced by its nematic background and
vice versa.
iv) The ratio (cid:96) controlling the orientational
relaxation of the background and the swimmer. For (cid:96) > 1
and σ > 1 the coupling between the swimmer and its ne-
matic surrounding is strong enough to rule out any hair-
pin turns to occur within the explored simulation time.
Some typical examples of swimmer trajectories generated
from the simulations are depicted in Fig. 1.

IV. MEAN DISPLACEMENTS AND

TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT MOBILITY

We start by testing the scaling predictions for the av-
eraged displacements parallel and transverse to the ne-
matic director for various temperatures in the nematic
regime of the Lebwohl-Lasher spins (the phase-diagram

s = limτ→∞(cid:104)(∆r⊥

is shown in Fig. 3c). While the parallel displacement
is ballistic for all temperatures (Fig. 2a), the transverse
contribution is highly non-trivial and displays the char-
acteristic logarithmic long-time behavior borne out from
our hydrodynamic theory (Fig. 2b). The rotational dis-
placement functions depicted in Fig. 2c demonstrate that
the swimmer quickly loses memory of its initial orienta-
tion but remains strongly aligned to the nematic director:
this is enforced by the coupling term Eq. (32). Conse-
quently, “hairpin” turns are absent within the time frame
of our simulations (see also Appendix A), and the swim-
mer keeps moving with its main direction parallel or anti-
parallel to ˆn, depending on its initial direction at τ = 0.

We now proceed with investigating the eﬀect of tem-
perature of the nematic on the swimmer mobility. The
corresponding results are shown in Fig. 3a. Reducing the
temperature of the nematic increases the parallel mobil-
ity of the swimmer, however only slightly. In the limit of

zero temperature the average velocity is expected to yield
the mean propulsion velocity vs of a free particle. The
perpendicular mobility, however, decreases with reducing
T ∗. This trend is captured qualitatively by the theoreti-
cal prediction Eq. (28). Finally, the long-time rotational
motility, represented by the rotational diﬀusion constant
s , decreases upon reduction of T ∗ be-
of the swimmer DR
cause the elastic forces dominate the thermal rotational
ﬂuctuations as T ∗ drops.

Our results demonstrate that, in contrast to isotropic
media, the coupling between temperature and the Frank
elasticity of the nematic medium strongly inﬂuences the
swimmer mobility,
in particular the transverse com-
ponent. This opens up new possibilities to control
self-assembly and collective behavior of active particles
and swimmers by ﬁne-tuning their microscopic mobility
through temperature.

Motivated by recent experimental studies of active
agents moving complex and anisotropic media we have
focused on analyzing the basic problem of diﬀusion of
an active particle or microswimmer in a macroscopic ne-
matic liquid crystal. Using hydrodynamic scaling theory
complemented by numerical simulation we have explored
self-diﬀusion of a self-propelled particle whose motion is
aﬀected by the thermal orientational ﬂuctuations of the
nematic background. These ﬂuctuations couple to the
swimming direction and therefore induce a superdiﬀu-
sive motion perpendicular to the nematic director ﬁeld.
The amplitude of this motion can be varied by changing
the thermodynamic parameters characterizing the back-
ground, in particular the temperature of the nematic.

Our predictions can be exploited to control and
tune the anisotropic motion of active carriers in non-
Newtonian ﬂuids which is of importance e.g.
in drug
delivery. Our results should be veriﬁable in real-space ex-
periments on swimmers, both artiﬁcial ones or bacteria.
The liquid crystalline medium can either be a molecular
liquid crystal [21, 24] or a passive colloidal liquid crystal.
Future work should be aimed at generalizing various
aspects of the model used in this work. First of all, it
would be intriguing to address the behavior of a collection
of microswimmers moving in a nematic medium. While
for isotropic, Newtonian solvents, collective eﬀects such
as swarming, kinetic clustering and turbulence [1–3, 43]
have been ﬁrmly established, it is unkown how this be-
havior is altered or enriched in case of collective propul-
sion in a nematic liquid crystalline medium.

Moreover the two-dimensional case (as e.g.

realized
for a passive colloidal monolayer hosting a swimmer on a
substrate) can be studied, for which the thermal ﬂuctu-
ations of the director ﬁeld are much larger than in three
spatial dimensions [44, 45]. We have analyzed this prob-
lem by the techniques used here, and ﬁnd isotropic super
diﬀusive behavior:

(cid:104)|∆rs(t)|2(cid:105) ∝ tΥ(T )

,

(38)

where the non-universal, temperature-dependent expo-
nent Υ(T ) is given by

decreasing function of temperature, and will always have
33 = 1.939393... ≤
a very narrow range of variation:
Υ(T ) ≤ 2. Details of this calculation will be given in a
future publication [48].

APPENDIX: HAIRPIN TURNS

In this Appendix, we consider hairpin turns. In Part
A, we estimate the characteristic time thairpin between
such turns, and show that, at the temperatures of our
simulations, it should be astronomically large (making
these events far less frequent than black hole mergers!).
This is consistent with our observation that such turns
never occur in our simulations. In Part B, we show that
for time scales t (cid:29) thairpin, both the mean drift along
the nematic director, and the anomalous t ln t lateral dif-
fusion, are lost, and motion in both directions becomes
diﬀusive, albeit with diﬀerent diﬀusion constants.

A. Rate of hairpin turns

swimmer are essentially equilibrium, with Hamiltonian

where η(T ) is the non-universal, temperature depen-
dent exponent characterizing the algebraic decay of di-
rector correlations in the low temperature, “Kosterlitz-
Thouless” [46] phase of the 2D nematic, which exists for
temperatures T < TKT , where TKT is the Kosterlitz-
Thouless transition temperature, above which director
ﬂuctuations become short-ranged (and the swimmer mo-
tion becomes conventionally diﬀusive). The exponent
η(T ) is usually a monotonically decreasing function of
temperature, and is always [47] bounded: 0 ≤ η(T ) ≤ 1
16 .
Thus, the exponent Υ(T ) will usually be a monotonically

Since the diﬀerence between the minimum and maximum
values of P2(x) (which occur at x = 1 and x = 0 respec-
tively, corresponding to angles of zero and 90 degrees
between the swimmer and the spin) is 3/2, the minimum

est T ∗, namely T ∗ = 0.67 and, hence, the smallest
value of τhairpin, we obtain, using our simulation val-
ues σ = 2a and (cid:96) = 5, a lower bound on τhairpin of
τhairpin > (cid:96)3 exp(18π3/2) = 4.23 × 1045. For our simu-
lations at lower temperatures T ∗, the time between hair-
pins is even longer. Thus, it is hardly surprising that
we see no hairpin turns in our simulations. Indeed, for
a wide range of realistic values of the parameters, they
will simply not occur on any time scale accessible either
in simulations, or in experiments. For such parameters,
therefore, the theory presented in the main text, which ig-
nores hairpin turns, will be valid. In particular, both the
ballistic motion along ˆn and the logarithmically anoma-
lous superdiﬀusion transverse to ˆn should occur.

This sum on s in this expression converges extremely

for which keeping the leading order term is accurate to

B. Eﬀect of hairpin turns

expect correlations of Υ to decay on a time scale thairpin:

11

Due to the exponential sensitivity of the hairpin turn
time to various microscopic model parameters, hairpin
turns should occur in some experimental situations (or
simulations) on a reasonable time scale. It therefore be-
hooves us to consider their eﬀect. We will argue in this
subsection that hairpin turns, for time scales t (cid:29) thairpin,
destroy both the mean drift along the nematic director,
and the anomalous t ln t lateral diﬀusion.
Instead, on
these long time scales, motion in both directions becomes
diﬀusive, albeit with diﬀerent diﬀusion constants.

Our argument begins by modifying equation (3) to in-

clude the possibility of hairpin turns:

drs(t)

dt

= Υ(t)vsˆn(rs(t), t) + f (t) ,

(53)

where

Υ(t) = ±1 ,

(54)

is a ﬂuctuating Ising variable that changes sign every time
a hairpin turn occurs. If we assume, as seems reasonable
for a with no long-term memory, that ﬂips in the sign of
Υ(t) are a Poisson process with rate 1/thairpin, then we

(cid:104)Υ(t(cid:48))Υ(t(cid:48)(cid:48))(cid:105) = exp(−|t(cid:48) − t(cid:48)(cid:48)|/thairpin) .

(55)

Thus we see that, even though the director ˆn(rs(t), t)
has long-ranged temporal correlations, as discussed in the
main text, correlations of the product Υ(t)vsˆn(rs(t), t)
will decay rapidly (exponentially) for t (cid:29) thairpin. Thus,
the anomalous behavior arising from the alignment of the
swimmer velocity with the nematic director, namely, the
development of a non-zero mean velocity along ˆn, and the
anomalous logarithmic superdiﬀusion (t ln t). Instead, we
expect the motion along the mean director direction will
now consist, roughly, of a “drunkards walk” along the
mean nematic director (cid:104)ˆn(cid:105) in which each step has mean
length vzthairpin, and lasts a mean time thairpin. This is
readily seen to lead, on longer time scales (t (cid:29) thairpin),
to diﬀusive behavior with a diﬀusion constant

D(cid:107)
s = v2

z thairpin .

(56)
The transverse wandering (cid:104)(∆r⊥
s (t))2(cid:105) will have its ln t
factor, which arises from the long time correlations, cut
oﬀ by thairpin for t (cid:29) thairpin, leading to diﬀusive behavior
in that direction as well, but with a diﬀusion constant
