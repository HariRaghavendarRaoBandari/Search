Abstract. The author in his previous works were presented a numerical integration
method, namely, global-adaptive with the Gauss-Kronrod numerical
integration
extension in order to accurate calculation of molecular auxiliary functions integrals
involve power functions with non-integer exponents. They are constitute elements
of molecular integrals arising in the Dirac equation when Slater-type orbitals with
non-integer principal quantum numbers are used. Binomial series representation of
power functions method, so far, is used for analytical evaluation of the molecular
auxiliary function integrals however,
integration cover areas beyond
the condition of convergence.
In the present study, analytical evaluation of these
integrals is re-examined. They are expressed via prolate spheroidal coordinates.
An alternative analytical approach is derived. Slowly convergent binomial series
representation formulae for power functions is investigated through nonlinear sequence
transformations for the acceleration of convergence. The results are compared with
those obtained from numerical calculations. The procedures discussed in this work
are capable of yielding highly accurate molecular integrals for all ranges of orbital
parameters in any programming language.

1. INTRODUCTION

The analytical solution of molecular integrals is the ﬁrst one to be preferred due to its
computational eﬃciency. It is also the most powerful solution since it expose features
of integrals and provide a wide range of use. A throughout investigation of physical
system, however, a lot of integrals or integral equations, which are seem unlikely to
be solved analytically, arise. This poses one of the major challenges, especially, in
algebraic solution of quantum mechanical many-body equations,
i.e., Hartree-Fock-
Roothaan (HFR) [1] and Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Roothaan (DHFR) equations [2, 3]. These
equations can be written in form of generalized eigenvalue problem [4] by representing

molecular orbitals in terms of a ﬁnite numbers of atomic basis orbitals. The Slater-type
orbitals [5–9],

from the Condon−Shortley phases by sign factor (−1)m [10, 11], Γ(z) are gamma
functions [12], {n, l, m} are the principal, orbital, magnetic quantum numbers with,
n ∈ R+, 0 ≤ l ≤ ⌊n⌋ − 1, −l ≤ m ≤ l and ⌊n⌋ stands for the integer part of n, ζ are
orbital parameters, respectively, are natural choice of basis orbitals because they are
obtained by simpliﬁcation of Laguerre functions in hydrogen-like wave functions [13] by
keeping only the term of the highest power of r. They also satisfy Kato’s cusp conditions
for asymptotic behavior of the wave function near the nucleus and at long distances from
it [14, 15].
These advantages have led to great desire to use Slater-type orbitals in molecular
structure calculations [16] since the ﬁrst principle of underlying molecular-level
mechanism of macroscopic phenomena is the structure calculations [17]. An eﬀective use
of Slater-type orbitals, undoubtedly, may bring with it signiﬁcant advances. However,
they can not only be considered as qualiﬁed, nominated basis orbitals are more
suitable to be used in applied science (there are several Slater-type orbitals based
electronic structure codes [18–20], yet, Amsterdam Density Functional program [20]
is only versatile). They are also play a key role in understanding of quantum
mechanical theoretical problems; usually arise from testing limits of the methods
obtained approximately to represent the physical systems, where reliable description
of electron density is important e.g., investigation the molecules under strong magnetic
ﬁeld [21], second order perturbation energy corrections [22].

Serious obstacles which are mathematical rather than physical, unfortunately,
reveal resulting from the use of Slater-type orbitals. The accurate evaluation of multi-
center integrals problem may be counted as the ﬁrst and foremost one. It has become a
major issue since 1951 [23]. In spite of an extensive literature and research [24] (a full
bibliography would count hundreds of positions, please see references therein for details),
there are still no satisfactory solutions in terms of accuracy and computing time, because
the Slater-type orbitals have no simple addition theorem; relations for products of two
Slater-type orbitals centered at diﬀerent positions are unavailable in compact form [25].
The single-center expansion method, which is obtained via complete orthonormal basis
orbitals to transform the Slater-type orbitals from one center to another [23, 26–28],

Vµlm,µ′l′m′(ζ, Rab)χµ′l′m′(ζ, r b),

Xµ′l′m′

where, {µ, µ′} ∈ N+, also results in an pathologically slow inﬁnite series [29,30]. Besides,
the expansion coeﬃcients are expressed in terms of two-center overlap integrals, which

3

are constitute the basic building block of more complicated multicenter integrals,

Snlm,n′l′m′ (ζ, ζ ′; Rab) =Z χnlm (ζ, r a) χn′l′m′ (ζ ′, r b) dV

where, Rab = r a − r b is the internuclear distance vector, r a, r b are radius vectors of
electrons with respect to nuclear labels a, b, and that may complicate the calculations
without digital erosion [31–33].
An another expansion method is suggested with idea of enabling the analytical
evaluation of molecular integrals over Slater-type orbitals with non-integer principal
quantum numbers by expanding them in terms of the Slater-type orbitals with integer
principal quantum numbers [34, 35],

The convergence of this expansion formulae, however, not only poor [36] it is also
objectionable in mathematical point of view [37, 38].

The author in his previous studies on molecular integrals evaluation focused on the
solution of accuracy problem [30, 36, 39]. The compact form relations for molecular
integrals were obtained by generalizing the solution of the Poisson equation as a
partial diﬀerential equation in spherical coordinates by expanding the potential the
set of functions referred to as spectral forms [40, 41]. They were expressed through
new molecular auxiliary functions integrals in prolate ellipsoidal coordinates. They
involve power functions with non-integer exponents, which means that they can not
be represent in a neighborhood of the origin by a convergent power series [37, 38].
So far, the suggested binomial inﬁnite series representation formulae for these power
functions is mathematically inconvenient, i.e., ill-conditioned, making it necessary to
take into consideration thousands of terms [30,36,39]. Benchmark values, therefore, were
produced with the numerical global-adaptive method and Gauss-Kronrod numerical
integration extension for the two-center ovarlap [36], two-center two-electron Coulomb,
hybrid [39], and three-center nuclear attraction integrals [30] up to 36−digits accuracy,
free from any restriction on quantum numbers, orbital parameters, and internuclear
distances, respectively.

In the present study, it will not be repeated the introductory remarks given in
previous studies, here, the correct analytical solutions, which are more diﬃcult to obtain
but in case they are obtained they may have more advantageous in terms of computing
time, are investigated.
In the following, the binomial inﬁnite series representation
formulas of molecular auxiliary functions integrals arising in molecular integrals are
re-examined via nonlinear sequence transformations method for the acceleration of
convergence [42]. New convergent series expansion formulae and recurrence relations
formulae also derived.
A computer program is constructed in the Mathematica programming language [43].
The Mathematica programming language can handle approximate real numbers with
any number of digits, thus, it is used with the included packages for computation of

4

mathematical functions [44]. But, the Mathematica is suitable only for benchmarking
in the view of calculation time. Notice that, the presented formulas in this study
are available to be written in various programming languages alternative to the
Mathematica. The calculations are performed for arbitrary values of parameters. The
results are compared with those obtained from numerical calculations.

2. EVALUATION OF RELATIVISTIC MOLECULAR AUXILIARY
FUNCTIONS INTEGRALS

The derived compact form expressions for two-center, one- and two-electron molecular
integrals in lined-up coordinate system thorough Laplace expansion of Coulomb
interaction [45–47] and prolate spheroidal coordinates (ξ, ν, φ) where, 1 ≤ ξ < ∞,
−1 ≤ ν ≤ 1, 0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π, are obtained in terms of following auxiliary functions
integrals [39],

where, {q, n1} ∈ N, {n2, n3, n4} ∈ R, p123 = {p1, p2, p3} (and in subsequent notations),
P, Q are the normalized incomplete gamma and the normalized complementary
incomplete gamma functions [48], (a)n is the Pochhammer symbol [12], respectively.
Notice that, there are no any computational diﬃculties arise in the molecular integrals
evaluation except accurate calculation of auxiliary functions given in the Eq. (5). The
analytical evaluation of these functions involve some challenges namely, power functions
with non-integer exponents, incomplete gamma functions and their multiplication forms
have no explicit closed-form relations.

In the present study, recurrence relations for these auxiliary functions integrals are
derived in ﬁrst place. Then, convergence properties of binomial series representation
formulae are investigated through methods used to improve their convergence. Finally,
an alternative convergent series representation approximations are derived

2.2. Series representation formulae

The derived recurrence relation formulas above are available only for integer values of
parameters. The major problem in the evaluation of Eq.(5) with recurrence relations is
that, the initial terms have no explicit closed-form expressions if their parameters are in
sets of real numbers, {n2, n3, n4} ∈ R. They are, therefore, should be obtained through
convergent series representation formulas of the incomplete gamma functions.

The incomplete gamma functions are one of the major topic in modern analysis
and they have a wide range of use in applied sciences [49–51]. An eﬃcient approach
for computing the incomplete gamma functions without erroneous last digits is still
being studied in the literature [49, 52, 53]. Several methods are available to calculate
the incomplete gamma functions accurately. Four domains of computation for the
incomplete gamma functions ratios corresponding to these methods was indicated in
[52, 54]. The domains were established a compromise between eﬃciency and accuracy.
The analytical evaluation of molecular auxiliary functions integrals, however, require
not only calculating the incomplete gamma functions accurately but also producing
sustain release formulations that may convenient to be used in the solution of integrals
involving them.
Two of these methods, which are Taylor expansions for the normalized incomplete
gamma and for the normalized complementary incomplete gamma functions P, Q,

carried out with Wynn’s epsilon method. The Wynn’s epsilon method is a nonlinear
method for accelerating the convergence of sequences, which are the terms of an inﬁnite
series, by sampling a number of additional terms in the series and then, trying to
extrapolate them by ﬁtting them to a polynomial multiplied by a decaying exponential.
This method provides an eﬃcient algorithm for implementing transformations of the

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

Before starting discussion on the results obtained in the present study, it should be
noticed that, they are obtained on a PC (Intel-core i7, 2.4Ghz(3630QM)) running
the Mathematica programming language. The Mathematica programming language
provides a uniquely integrated and automated environment for parallel computing.
Users can compute the formulas including summations with all cores of PC eﬀectively
via the ParallelSum command instead of the Sum.

Once, it is utilized from series representation of the incomplete gamma functions,
which are arise only in two-center two-electron integrals i.e., they are equal to one for
two-center one-electron integrals and the Legendre polynomials are used in their place
for three-center integrals, the Eq.
(31) through recurrence
relations obtained by lowering the indices q (q ∈ N). The correct analytical solution
of Eq. (31), thus, become an essential condition in evaluation of molecular integrals
via prolate spheroidal coordinates and auxiliary functions integrals methods since the
angular part of Slater-type orbitals have analytically closed form relations.

In Table 1, smallest number of terms needed to satisfy accuracy of series
representation of incomplete gamma functions with 15−digits are presented. Here,

scientiﬁc notation (cid:0)N × 10M(cid:1), where N referred to as mantissa and M is the exponent

is used. The number of correct digits used to truncate the series are determined
by mantissa. The reference values are obtained numerically via the Mathematica
programming language, which is able to give exact values, using Γ(a, 0, x) command
for incomplete gamma and Γ(a, x) command for complementary incomplete gamma
functions, respectively. Convergence behavior of incomplete gamma functions can also
be predict by a method given in [54]. There, to have an idea about number of terms
needed for obtaining a certain error (ǫ) after truncating the series, it is written,

In ﬁrst row, results obtained from Eq. (25) and in second results obtained from Eq. (26)
are given for several values of a and x. The sign ”+” is used to denote conﬁrmation of
relation Q = 1 − P . The sign ”∞” is used to denote that, the number of terms needed
for 15−digits accuracy in the Eq. (26) are much higher than the Eq. (25). It can be
seen from this table that, for both large and small values of parameters using the Eq.
(25) is more advantageous. The Eq. (26) is, therefore, only available to be used in small
values of parameters. Nevertheless, sustain release formulations for incomplete gamma
functions are still necessary.

The Newton’s method, which is generalization the binomial series representation of
power function with integer exponent to a non-integer exponent due to Taylor expansion
of (1 + ν)n functions, are performed, so far, in analytical solution of molecular auxiliary
functions integrals. The binomial series representation of power functions, however, not
free from constraints and only work rigorously for (ξ + ν)n if | ν

ξ | < 1.

In Table 2, convergence of the binomial series representation of power functions are
examined for limit values of auxiliary functions integrals interval (ξ → 1; ν → ±1), where
| ν
ξ | ≈ 1. The Wynn’s epsilon algorithm is also used to accelerate of their convergence.
In the ﬁrst column of this table results obtained from the Eqs. (34, 35) and in second
convergence improvements of these equations are presented depending on the number of
terms used in summation. The reference values, which are obtained numerically, are also
given at the bottom. In this and following tables, the digits underlined and the digits in
bold indicate the digits that match the exact results and the convergence property of the
method, respectively. This table shows that, although the Wynn’s epsilon algorithm may

used to improve convergence of the binomial series representations of power functions
they are still ill-conditioned and making it necessary to take into account thousands
term.

Alternatively convergent series expansions of the Eq. (31) are derived. Here, the
problem of analytical evaluation of the Eq. (31) is separated into two parts, one of which
is utilized when molecular integrals of Slater-type orbitals have same orbital parameters
(ζ = ζ ′ in the Eq. (3)). In this case, the parameter p3 is equal to zero and Eq.(41)
should be used. The other is utilized when orbitals parameters are not equal (Eq. (48)),
where p3 6= 0.
In the contrast to previous methods, results obtained from series expansion relations
given in the Eqs. (41, 48) are able to be compared with numerical integration of the Eq.
(31) through the global-adaptive method with Gauss-Kronrod extension, where input
criteria given by MaxRecursion, which is an option in the Mathematica programming
language for numerical integration that speciﬁes how many recursive subdivides can
be made, are used to stop the algorithms. Tables 3, 4 are generated accordingly. In
the present paper the MaxRecursion determined as 100. In ﬁrst column benchmark

values obtained from numerical integration method, and in following columns results
obtained from the Eqs. (41, 48) are given depending on parameters p1, p2 and p3 and
the number of terms used in summation. Convergence of these equations is obvious
for small values of parameters. Large values of parameters, thus, are also used in
order to test of their convergence properties. The digits underlined and the digits in
bold have same properties as given in previous tables. The numbers in parenthesis
are WorkingPrecision which is another option for numerical integration that speciﬁes
how many digits of precision should be maintained in internal computations in the
Mathematica programming language, the number of terms used in summation and
computing time in seconds, respectively. The numbers terms needed for 25−digits
accuracy, which are up to 120 for Table 3 and up to 150 for Table 4 are computed
in a reasonable computing time in spite of the Mathematica programming language
is not advantageous in this respect. The method suggested in this paper is available
to be written in diﬀerent programming languages and use of high level programming
languages may provides a signiﬁcant gain than numerical approximation in terms of
computing time.
