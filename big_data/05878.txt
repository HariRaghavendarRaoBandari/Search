Two-, three-, and four-boson systems are studied close to the unitary limit using potential models
constructed to reproduce the minimal information given by the two-body scattering length a and the
two-body binding energy or virtual state energy E2. The particular path used to reach the unitary
limit is given by varying the potential strength. In this way the energy spectrum in the three- and
four-boson systems is computed. The lowest energy states show ﬁnite-range eﬀects absorbed in the
construction of level functions that can be used to study real systems. Higher energy levels are free
from ﬁnite-range eﬀects, therefore the corresponding level functions tend to the zero-range universal
function. Using this property a zero-range equation for the four-boson system is proposed and the
four-boson universal function is computed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The Eﬁmov eﬀect has been predicted by V. Eﬁmov
in a series of papers [1, 2] and experimentally conﬁrmed
more than 35 years after its prediction [3]. At present
there is an intense experimental activity [4–7] aiming at
understanding the behavior of few-body systems close
to the unitary limit in which the two-body scattering
length a diverges. Around this limit the systems show
universal behavior; very diﬀerent systems such as atomic
or nuclear systems present similar features. The study
of these characteristics is a very active ﬁeld of research
nowadays. From a theoretical point of view the behav-
ior of a few-body system in the limit of large scatter-
ing length can be formulated in the framework of the
renormalization group using an Eﬀective Field Theory
(EFT) [8, 9] (for recent reviews see Refs. [10, 11]). Us-
ing this language, one of the main striking properties
of three identical bosons in the unitary limit is the dis-
crete scaling invariance (DSI) shown by the spectrum:
an inﬁnite series of bound states (trimers) appears dis-
tributed geometrically with accumulation point at zero
energy. The ratio of binding energies for two consecutive
states is En
= e2π/s0 , with the universal number
s0 ≈ 1.00624. Explicitly, the total angular momentum
L = 0 spectrum of three identical bosons in the zero-
range limit can be described by the Eﬁmov radial law

The main ingredients in these equations are the universal
function ∆3(ξ) and the binding momentum κ∗, called
the three-body parameter, deﬁning the energy 2κ2
∗/m
of level n∗ at the unitary limit, m being the boson mass.
DSI manifests from the fact that the function ∆3(ξ) is
the same for all n levels. Furthermore, the spectrum
described by these equations is not bounded from below,
this characteristic is known as the Thomas collapse [12].

The determination of the universal function ∆3(ξ) in
the interval −π ≤ ξ ≤ −π/4 limited by the two- and
three-cluster continuum can be obtained by solving the
Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian (STM) equation or equiva-
lently by using Eﬀective Field Theory (EFT) as reported
in Ref. [8]. This equation describes the L = 0 state of a
three-boson system in the zero-range limit. To avoid the
Thomas collapse it is a common practice to introduce a
cutoﬀ in the solution of the STM equation and the uni-
versal function ∆3(ξ) is computed looking at the second
or even third excited state [13] where the cutoﬀ eﬀects
are negligible. A parametrization of it can be found in
Ref. [10]. In the same way potential models can be used
to solve the Schr¨odinger equation looking at the high part
of the spectrum, where ﬁnite-range eﬀects are negligible.

The extension of the zero-range theory to four bosons
has been discussed in Refs. [14–17]. The main conclusion
of these works is that the four-boson spectrum presents
a two-level tree structure. For each three-body level
En
3 there are two four-body states (tetramers), one deep
(m = 0) and one shallow (m = 1), with binding ener-
gies En,m
. The universal ratios of these binding ener-
gies in the unitary limit have been calculated in Ref. [18]
and they are En,0

In the present work we would like to analyze the com-
plete interval between the four-body continuum and the
dimer-dimer thresholds in order to extend Eq.(1) to the
four-boson system and, if possible, to determine the cor-
responding universal function.

The present study is done using potential models with
variable strength. In this way a path to reach the uni-
tary limit is deﬁned.
It has been recently shown that
a two-parameter potential captures the essential ingre-
dients of the few-boson dynamics close to the unitary
limit [19]. Accordingly, here we deﬁne two diﬀerent po-
tentials, a local gaussian and a nonlocal gaussian used to
solve the Schr¨odinger equation along the path. For the
lowest states ﬁnite-range eﬀects are appreciable. For this
case it is possible to deﬁne level functions that absorb
those eﬀects and can be used to estimate the spectrum
of a real system close to the unitary limit. For higher
states ﬁnite-range eﬀects can be neglected and the solu-
tion tends to the zero-range limit therefore the level func-
tions tend to the universal zero-range function. In order
to illustrate the procedure we ﬁrst analyse the two-body
system and then the analysis is extended to the three-
and four-boson systems.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II the par-
ticular path used to reach the unitary limit is studied in
the two-body system. In Sec. III and IV the spectra of
the three- and four-boson systems are computed using
the two potential models, local and nonlocal. From the
results a zero-range equation for the four-boson system
is proposed. The conclusion and perspectives are given
in the last section.

II. REACHING THE UNITARY LIMIT WITH

POTENTIAL MODELS

In the two-body system the L = 0 spectrum within the

zero-range theory can be deﬁned through the relations

E2 =

k cot δ0 = −

(2a)

(2b)

The ﬁrst relation establishes that there is a bound state
(a > 0) or a virtual state (a < 0) with binding energy
E2 ﬁxed by the scattering length a. At positive energies,
E = 2k2/m, the s-wave phase-shift δ0 is determined by
the scattering length as well. Accordingly, the scattering
length a emerges as a control parameter in terms of which
the observables as the cross section or mean square radius
can be computed. The zero-range theory describes the
extreme situation in which the two particles are always
outside the interaction range. If the two-body quantum
system, interacting through a short-range potential, has
a shallow state, there is a big probability of ﬁnding the
particles outside the interaction range. In fact, when E2
is very small or, equivalently, aB = /√mE2 >> r0,

2

with r0 the interaction range, the two-body wave func-
tion has a very long tail and the two particles have a large
probability of being at relative distances greater than r0.
When a shallow state is present, the scattering length
veriﬁes a >> r0 too, and a ≈ aB, with Eq.(2a) approx-
imately fulﬁlled. The extension of Eq.(2) in the case of
ﬁnite-range interactions and at low energies is

with rB = a− aB. The above discussion stressed the fact
that in the low energy limit or large scattering length
limit the dynamics of the two-body system depends on
two parameters: the scattering length and the eﬀective
range reﬀ (or the length rB).

The scaling limit is deﬁned by rB → 0 whereas in the
unitary limit 1/a and 1/aB → 0. In the ﬁrst case, for
each value of a the two-body energy is determined by the
zero-range condition a = aB. When rB 6= 0, the unitary
limit can be reached by diﬀerent paths determined by
the functional relation aB = aB(a). Having in mind that
we intend to study the structure of few-boson systems,
we construct a two-parameter potential able to reproduce
the minimal information given by one speciﬁc set of a and
aB values. Then the potential strength can be varied in
order to reach the unitary limit. We deﬁne local (given
in coordinate space) and nonlocal (given in momentum
space) gaussian potentials

the functional relation aB = aB(a) is determined.

tive range and strength at unitary are given in table I for
the cases in which there are n bound states in the two-
body system. Note that the nonlocal potential, being

In the following we consider the n = 0 case, however
the other cases can be analyzed in a similar way. We are
interested in the functional relation aB(a) as 1/a → 0.

Inserting the above expansion in Eq.(8) the eﬀective
range expansion in terms of the inverse of the scatter-
ing length becomes

If the length rB were constant along the path, the coeﬃ-
cient C would be 0.5 and D = 0 as well as higher terms.
Diﬀerences from these values indicate a non constant be-
havior of rB. For example the study of the van der Waals
(vdW) potential shows a quadratic relation between reﬀ
and the inverse of the scattering length. Explicitly it
results (see Ref. [20] and references therein)

of the LG and NLG potentials the behavior is almost
linear (D ≈ 0), with the coeﬃcient C ≈ 0.504 and 0.393,
respectively. The relation aB = aB(a) can be analyzed
starting from the following deﬁnition

included the LM2M2 Helium-Helium interaction from
Aziz [21]. We can conclude that Eq.(13) can be seen
as a universal relation describing the path to the unitary
limit ﬁxed by the relation a− aB = constant. Potentials
with variable strength follow this path with reasonable
accuracy, however ﬁrst order corrections could be of the
order of a few percent for the LG potential and up to
10% in the case of the NLG potential.

III. UNIVERSAL BEHAVIOR IN THE

THREE-BODY SECTOR

The analysis of the two-boson system indicates that
a two-parameter potential as local or non-local gaussian
can be used to study the low-energy dynamics around
the unitary limit. We will extend the analysis to the
three- and four-boson systems. The numerical results for
the local gaussian are obtained solving the Schr¨odinger
equation in the coordinate space framework using the
Hyperspherical Harmonic expansion [22–24] while the
predictions for the non-local gaussian are obtained solv-
ing Faddeev-Yakubovsky (FY) [25] or Alt-Grassberger-
Sandhas (AGS) equations [26] using momentum-space
methods from Refs. [18, 27].

The L = 0 spectrum of three identical bosons in the
zero-range limit can be described by the Eﬁmov radial
law given in Eq.(1). In the case of a system with a ﬁnite
range interaction, this equation can be seen as describ-
ing the asymptotic spectrum of the three-boson system

close to the unitary limit.
In fact, the solution of the
Schr¨odinger equation can be used to determine the uni-
versal function ∆3(ξ) looking at the excited states of the
spectrum as, for these states, ﬁnite-range eﬀects are neg-
ligible. In this context the description of few-body sys-
tems with potential models close to the unitary limit can
be seen as a particular regularization scheme. Accord-
ingly it is possible to modify the Eﬁmov radial law as
(see Refs. [19, 28])

the ﬁnite-range character of the interaction slightly mod-
iﬁes the ratio κn
from its universal value of ≈ 22.7.
The main modiﬁcation in the above equations is the in-
3 (ξ). For the ground
state (n = 0) it could be very diﬀerent from the zero-
range function ∆3(ξ). As we will see below the diﬀer-
ences are much reduced considering the ﬁrst excited state
(n = 1) and, starting from n > 1, both functions almost
coincide. The level function can be calculated using the
corresponding solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation as

cited state (red diamonds) completely overlaps with the

It should be noticed that for n = 0, 1 this function de-
pends on the particular potential used to calculate the
spectrum or, in the case of the STM equation, the cutoﬀ.
It depends also on the particular path selected to reach
the unitary limit, for example, potentials with variable
strength as discussed in the previous section. However, as
shown in Ref. [19], following this particular path diﬀerent
3(ξ) and
3(ξ). Furthermore the LG potential deﬁnes a unique
3 (ξ) for each level n independent of
the range, r0, of the potential. In particular, for the ﬁrst
two levels n = 0, 1, the binding momenta at the unitary
limit are κ0
3 = 0.0212/r0 and the ra-
tio κ0
3 ≈ 23.0. These values have been obtained with
the potential acting only in s-waves, they are slightly dif-
ferent when the LG potential is taken to act in all waves
(see for example Refs. [19, 29]). Also the NLG potential
acting in s-wave deﬁnes a unique nonlocal gaussian func-
tion with the following universal ratios κ0
3/k0 = 0.2127,
κ1
3/k0 = 0.009085 and κ0
3 ≈ 23.4. From the above dis-
cussion the following picture emerges: a two-parameter
potential as the local or nonlocal gaussians can be used
to construct level functions for each level n of the three-
boson system. For n = 0, 1 these functions are diﬀerent

3 (ξ) for diﬀerent
levels and potentials. The zero-range universal function ∆3(ξ)
is shown as the red solid curve.

The Eﬁmov radial law is a one-parameter equation.
The knowledge of the universal function ∆3(ξ) allows for
a complete determination of the spectrum after assign-
ing a value to κ∗ (or to one of the energies En
3 ). Eq.(14)
applies mostly to n = 0, 1 and works slightly diﬀerently.
In ﬁrst place it is necessary to calculate the level func-
tions for the ground and ﬁrst excited state. This can be
done using for example the LG or NLG potentials. At
this point the equation is a one-parameter equation and
the n = 0 and n = 1 spectrum can be completely de-
termined from the knowledge of one energy. One can
argue that if we use Eq.(14) to describe a particular
system, the respective potential could be used to com-
3(ξ) by varying the
strength in order to reach the unitary limit. However,
as it is shown in Fig. 2, close to the unitary limit the
three-boson system has universal behavior and therefore
a two-parameter potential captures the essential ingredi-
ents of the dynamics absorbing ﬁnite range eﬀects. As

with the LM2M2 potential the result is 0.0440 a−1

shows that the level functions produce a description with
the accuracy better than 1% . The results for the three-

In Fig. 3 the level function e∆3,0

range eﬀects can be neglected and, therefore, we can con-
sider this function a good representation of the zero-range
four-body universal function in the level m = 0. For a
generic level m we deﬁne this function ∆m

not depend on the three-body branch n, as DSI, with the

with the zero-range universal function ∆3(ξ) and the level

the range of ξ values in which this level results an in-
elastic virtual state (IVS) is explicitly shown. From the
ﬁgure we can see that ∆3(ξ) and ∆m
4 (ξ) are very close
to each other around the unitary limit. As the func-
tions approach the diﬀerent thresholds diﬀerences ap-

V. CONCLUSIONS

In the present work we have analysed two-, three- and
four-boson systems close to the unitary limit. To this aim
we have solved the Schr¨odinger equation (or FY and AGS
equations) using potential models with variable strength
constructed to reproduce the minimal information given
by the two-body scattering length a and the two-body
binding energy or virtual state energy E2. It has been
shown that a two-parameter interaction as a gaussian
can capture the main ingredients of the dynamics in this
region. Moreover these type of potentials deﬁne level
functions independent of the range used to compute it.
This property can be used to construct level functions of

general validity that can be used to predict some char-
acteristics of real systems along the particular path used
3 and
have two properties: when they are used in the
lowest branches, n = 0, 1, they absorb ﬁnite-range eﬀects.
This portion of the spectrum does not show a perfect DSI
since ﬁnite-range eﬀects are visible. So the interest here
is to use the level functions to describe the dynamics of
real systems close to the unitary limit. For example po-
tentials with variable strength describe with reasonable
accuracy the variation of the interatomic potential using
broad Feshbach resonances in ultra cold atomic traps.

tential with variable strength. Other possibilities could
be for example the study of coupled channel interactions
as in molecular systems. In this way diﬀerent level func-
tions can be constructed allowing to a systematic study
of ﬁnite-range eﬀects. Other improvements of the present
work could be the study of the spectrum as the number
of bosons increases. Preliminary results along this line
have been obtained [31]. Finally we would like to men-
tion the recent study of Eﬁmov physics in the three-body
system having spin-isospin degrees of freedom [38]. The
extension to the four-body system is under way.

The second property is given by the description of the
asymptotic part of the spectrum. For levels with n >
1 the spectrum calculated with the potentials starts to
show DSI and coincides with the spectrum in the zero-
range limit. Accordingly, the level functions for n > 1
do not depend any more on the level number n and on
the particular potential used to compute it as well as the
path selected to reach the unitary limit. They are good
representations of the universal functions ∆3 and ∆m
4 .
This property has been used here to propose Eq.(20) as
an extension of the Eﬁmov radial law for four bosons.

In the present work we have studied a particular path
to reach the unitary limit based on a single channel po-
