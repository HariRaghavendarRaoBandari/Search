Rotation Sets of Billiards with N Obstacles on a

Torus

Zainab Alsheekhhussain

March 14, 2016

Abstract

For billiards with N obstacles on a torus, we study the behavior of
speciﬁc kind of its trajectories, the so called admissible trajectories. Using
the methods developed in [1], we prove that the admissible rotation set is
convex, and the periodic trajectories of admissible type are dense in the
admissible rotation set. In addition, we show that the admissible rotation
set is a proper subset of the general rotation set.

Keywords: torus, general rotation set, admissible rotation set, rotation vector.

Introduction

Rotation Theory plays an important role in the study of various dynamical sys-
tems. Rotation vectors and sets provide essential information for understanding
the behavior of trajectories of a billiard system [1], [11].

The dynamical system we investigate in this paper is the billiard on an m-dimensional
torus in the exterior of N convex obstacles. We associate with it a natural
observable–the so called displacement as we consider continuous time. The main
considerations are on the universal covering Rm of the torus.

The methodology that we use in this paper has been developed by Blokh, Misi-
urewicz and Sim´anyi in [1], where they have studied billiard on a torus with one

convex obstacle. In the present paper, we extend their arguments and show how
to deal with an arbitrary number of convex obstacles satisfying a certain no-eclipse
condition.

This model is very important in statistical physics as it is related to the hard ball
model and the Lorentz gas model (see [2], [3]).

To summarize our results, we have to emphasize ﬁrst that we deal mainly with a
speciﬁc kind of trajectories–the so called admissible trajectories–that satisfy certain
properties. We prove that the set consisting of rotation vectors of those kind of
trajectories is convex. In addition, we prove that the rotation vectors of periodic
trajectories of admissible type are dense in this set.

However, whether the general rotation set is convex, or the periodic trajectories
are dense in it are two natural questions that need a separate investigation. We
believe that the results in this paper could help in this direction.

We refer to reader to [3], [4], [9] and [10] for the deﬁnition and general information
about billiards and billiards on a torus in particular.

Concerning general information about Rotation Theory and references, the reader
could see [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] and [12].

2 Billiards on a torus

Consider the class of billiards on the m-dimensional torus Tm = Rm/Zm (m ≥ 2)
in the exterior of N obstacles Or, r = 1, ..., N, where the obstacles are strictly
convex disjoint bodies with smooth (C 2) boundaries of diameter less than

√2
4 .

Let φ : Rm −→ Tm be the natural covering of Tm where φ([0, 1]m) = Tm, and let

φ−1(Or) ∩ [0, 1]m = O(0,r).

That is to say that we assume the covering and the coordinates in Tm are chosen
so that O(0,r) is in the interior of [0, 1]m for all r = 1, ..., N. This assumption
follows from the ﬁrst main assumption bellow. Setting O(k,r) = O(0,r) + k for
k ∈ Zm, r = 1, ..., N, we have φ−1(Or) = ∪k∈ZmO(k,r). We will consider billiard
trajectories in Ω = Rm\K, where K = ∪k∈Zm ∪N
r=1 O(k,r). Clearly, the projection
via φ of such trajectories are billiard trajectories in Tm\ ∪N

r=1 Or.

In this paper, we make the following

Assumptions:

3

Z. Alsheekhhussain

• The obstacles are located in positions such that, in S0 = [0, 1]m, if πi : Rm →
R are projections deﬁned by πi(x1, ..., xi, ..., xm) = xi then, for every i and
for every r 6= r′, we have

πi(Or) ∩ πi(Or′) = ∅;

(2.1)

• The obstacles in S0 satisfy the standard no-eclipse condition: the convex hull
of any two obstacles has no common points with any of the other obstacles.
Note that we need the no-eclipse condition to be satisﬁed just in S0 and not
in the whole plane.

We will use some terminology from [1]. For k, i, j and i 6= j, if the obstacle O(k,r)
has a common point with the convex hull of O(i,s) ∪ O(j,t) then we will say that
O(k,r) is between them. We will say that a trajectory T is of type (kn, rn)∞n=0 if a
continuous lifting of T to Rm starts at O(k0,r0), where k0 = 0, and its consecutive
reﬂections are from O(kn,rn), n ∈ N. In some situations, it is more convenient to
study the type of a piece of a trajectory, so then we will consider a ﬁnite sequence.
We study mostly one-sided trajectories of special kind deﬁned below.

Note that due to Lemma 2.1 in [1], if the trajectory is not tangent at its initial
point then it has inﬁnitely many reﬂections.
A sequence {(kn, rn)}p
is called admissible:

n=0, where p could be ∞, satisfying the following conditions

(i) k0 = 0;

(ii) (kn+1, rn+1) 6= (kn, rn) for every n;

(iii) For every n < p, there is no obstacle between O(kn,rn) and O(kn+1,rn+1);

(iv) For every n < p − 1, the obstacle O(kn+1,rn+1) is not between O(kn,rn) and
O(kn+2,rn+2).

We will denote the length of a trajectory piece T by | T | and its displacement by
d(T ), that is the length of the diﬀerence between its initial point and end point.

tn

)∞n=1 = ( yn−xn

We deﬁne the general rotation set R to be the set consisting of all limit points of
sequences of type ( d(Tn)
)∞n=1 where there is a trajectory piece Tn in
|Tn|
Rm from xn to yn of length tn, and tn goes to inﬁnity. The admissible rotation set
AR is the set consisting of all limit points of trajectories of admissible type. By
deﬁnition, both sets are closed and contained in the closed unit ball in Rm, and
the admissible rotation set is contained in the general rotation set.
For a full trajectory L starting at x ∈ Rm, if the limit of the sequence ( d(Tn)
)∞n=1,
|Tn|
where d(Tn) the length of the diﬀerence between the starting point and the nth

4

Z. Alsheekhhussain

reﬂection point, exists then we will call it the rotation vector of x. This limit
depends only on the trajectory. (I.e. if we choose another point on that trajectory
to be the initial point, the limit will not change.) Hence, we can call it the rotation
vector of the trajectory.

For a periodic orbit, denote by P the piece of the periodic trajectory that represents
its period. Clearly, the rotation vector for any periodic trajectory exists and equals
d(P )
|P|
Now we can examine the connection between admissible sequences and trajectories.

.

As in [1], we have the following.

Theorem 2.1 For every admissible sequence (kn, rn)∞n=0, there is a billiard tra-
jectory of type (kn, rn)∞n=0.
Proof. Fix n and consider the map F : Z0 × Z1 × .... × Zn −→ R, where Zj is the
set consisting of all points on the boundary of the obstacle O(kj ,rj), deﬁned by

F (x(n)

0 , x(n)

1 , ....., x(n)

n ) =k x(n)

0 − x(n)

1 k + k x(n)

1 − x(n)

2 k +...+ k x(n)

n−1 − x(n)

n k,

x(n)
j belongs to the boundary of the obstacle O(kj ,rj). Clearly, F is continuous and
the value of F depends only on the choice of x(n)
. In addition, the space Z0 × Z1 ×
... × Zn is compact. Hence, F has an absolute minimum at (x(n)

1 , ..., x(n)
n ).

0 , x(n)

j

, x(n)

Let η be the minimum curve joining xj’s by straight segments. By property (iii) of
an admissible sequence, we have that any segment joining two consecutive points
x(n)
j+1 cannot intersect any obstacle other than O(kj ,rj), O(kj+1,rj+1) (the ones
j
they belong to). By minimality of η and property (iv), we have that the segment
cannot intersect O(kj ,rj), O(kj+1,rj+1) at more than one point. Now η is minimal,
so at every x(n)
, j = 1, ..., n − 1, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of
reﬂection. Thus, η is a piece of trajectory.

j

By the argument above, for j greater or equal to 1, for any admissible sequence
(kn, rn)j
j) of that type. Let the
following be trajectory pieces:

n=0, we can ﬁnd a trajectory piece η = (xj

of the pth column of (2.2) converging to some xp . Then the sequence (xi)∞i=0 is
the required trajectory.

Note that the above Theorem can be generalized to the case where the admissible
sequence is of the form (kn, rn)∞
−∞. In addition, for an admissible sequence where
(kn+q, rn) = (kn+p, rn) for every n, where p is in Zm and q is a positive integer, we
can choose a periodic trajectory of this type with discrete period q.

Note 2.2 Lemma 2.3 and Corollary 2.4 from [1] show that if (kn, rn)s
n=0 is a ﬁnite
sequence (not necessary admissible) of elements of Zm × {1, ..., N}, and if x0 is
in ∂O(k0,r0) and xs is in ∂O(ks,rs) then there is at most one trajectory piece of this

6

Z. Alsheekhhussain

type starting at x0 and ending at xs even when the ﬁrst segment of the trajectory
piece intersects O(k0,r0) and the last segment intersects O(kn,rn). Moreover, if the
trajectory piece has admissible type then it is the shortest path of that type starting
and ending at those points.

Let dr be the diameter of the obstacle Or for every r = 1, ..., N, and let d be the
maximal dr. The next lemma will show that, for any ﬁnite admissible sequence,
the lengths of the trajectory pieces of its type depend on the points x0 and xs, but
they can diﬀer by at most 2d.

Lemma 2.3 The diﬀerence between the lengths of the trajectory pieces of the same
admissible sequence of type (kn, rn)s

n=0 is at most 2d.

Proof. Following the procedure in [1], take any two trajectory pieces of type
(kn, rn)s
n=0 starting at x0, y0 and ending at xs, ys respectively. Then, by adding
the segments connecting x0 with y0 and xs with ys at the beginning and end of
the ﬁrst trajectory piece, we get a path joining y0 with ys of length not shorter
than the length of the second trajectory piece, by Note 2.2, but can exceed its
length by at most dr0 + drs ≤ 2d. As the two trajectory pieces are arbitrary, we
prove the lemma.

Note 2.4 Clearly, the diﬀerence between the displacements of trajectory pieces of
the same admissible sequence type is at most 2d.

3 Directed Graph

Again we will use an idea from [1] with appropriate modiﬁcations.

In order to deﬁne our directed graph G, we need to look at the deﬁnition of an
admissible sequence from diﬀerent prospective. For a sequence (kn, rn) of ordered
pairs of elements of Zm × {1, ...., N}, let (ln, rn) = (kn − kn−1, rn) and (l0, r0) =
(0, r0). Then the sequences (kn, rn)∞n=1 and (ln, rn)∞n=1 are equivalent, i.e.
from
each of them we can recover the other. Hence, we can restate conditions (iii) and
(iv) as follows: (iii) For every n, there is no obstacle between O(0,rn−1) and O(ln,rn);
(iv) The obstacle O(ln,rn) is not between O(0,rn−1) and O(ln+ln+1,rn+1).

Deﬁnition of Directed Graph:

The vertices of the directed graph are the ordered pairs (j, s), where j ∈ Zm,
s = 1, 2, ...., N and there is no r = 1, 2, ..., N such that there is an obstacle between
O(0,r) and O(j,s). There is an edge from (j, s) to (i, t), where j, i ∈ Zm if and only
if there exists r = 1, 2, .., N such that O(j,s) is not between O(0,r) and O(i+j,t).

7

Z. Alsheekhhussain

Hence, we can deal with admissible sequences (ln, rn)∞n=1 as one-sided paths in G.
Note that there is no vertex (j, s) with an edge from it to itself. In addition, G is
symmetric. That is, if (j, s) is a vertex then (−j, s) is a vertex; there is an edge
from (j, s) to (−j, s), and if there is an edge from (j, s) to (k, t) then there is an
edge from (−j, s) to (−k, t).

Note that, by our assumption (the obstacles in S0 satisfy the no-eclipse condition),
all pairs (0, r), r = 1, 2, ..., N, are vertices and there is an edge between any two
of them.

Lemma 2.7 in [1] shows another kind of symmetry in G in the case of one obstacle,
and we restate this lemma with some modiﬁcations to be able to apply it to our
case.

Lemma 3.1 Let k, j be in Zm. If O(k,t) is not between O(0,r) and O(k+j,s), then
O(j,t) is not between O(0,s) and O(k+j,r).

Proof. Consider the map f (x) = k + j − x. The image of O(0,r) is O(k+j,r) and
f (O(k+j,s)) = O(0,s), f (O(k,t)) = O(j,t), which proves the lemma.

Corollary 3.2 If there is an edge in G from (k, t) to (j, s), so there is r such that
O(k,t) is not between O(0,r) and O(k+j,t), then there is an edge from (j, t) to (k, r).

We want now to show that our graph G is connected, but ﬁrst we will need several
lemmas.

Lemma 3.3 The set of vertices of G is ﬁnite.

Proof. We follow the procedure in [1]. Fix an interior point xr of O(0,r). Any ray
starting at this point will intersect an obstacle other than O(0,r) say O(k,t) (This is
due to Lemma 2.1 of [1]).

Denote by V(k,t) the set of directions in which any ray starting at xr intersects
the interior of O(k,t). This set is open. Then the union of all the sets of this kind
will be an open cover of the unit sphere which is compact. Hence, it has a ﬁnite
sub-cover. This implies that there is a constant M > 0 such that all rays of length
M starting at xr intersect the interior of some O(k,t), where O(k,t) 6= O(0,r).

Clearly, the set of vertices of G in the case considered in this paper is much smaller
than the set of vertices for the case of a torus with one obstacle.

We will denote by U the set of all ordered pairs of the form (u, r), where u is a
unit vector in Zm, a vector with one component ±1 and the other components
equal to 0, r = 1, 2, ..., N. Note that all elements of U are vertices by condition
2.1.

8

Z. Alsheekhhussain

Lemma 3.4 For any vertex (v, r) in the graph G, where v is in Zm, there is (u, r)
in U such that there is an edge from (v, r) to (u, r).

Proof. Follows that in [1]. Assume that (v, r) is a vertex, and v does not equal 0.
Hence, there is a unit vector u ∈ Zm such that hu, vi ≤ 0. We show that we can
separate (v, r) from (0, r) and (u + v, r).

2 , then the distance of B from L is at least

Consider the triangle with vertices A = 0, B = v and C = u + v. Let D and
E be the points on the sides BA, BC respectively, whose distance from B is 1
2.
Let L be the straight line through D and E. Since the angle at the vertex B is
√2
at most π
4 . Since | AD |≥| BD |
and | CE |≥| BE |, the distances of A and C from L are at least as large as the
distance of B from L. Now if we shift this triangle such that its vertices A, B, C
will be in the centers of the obstacles (0, r), (v, r), (u + v, r) respectively, then
the hyperplane of dimension m − 1 through L will separate (v, r) from (0, r) and
(u + v, r). i.e (v, r) is not between (0, r) and (u + v, r). Thus, by the deﬁnition
of an edge in G, there is an edge from (v, r) to (u, r).

Note that, due to Corollary 3.2, there is also an edge from (u, r) to (v, r).

Now we can proof the main result of this section, the connectivity of G.

Theorem 3.5 The graph G is connected. In addition, for any two vertices (v, s)
and (k, t) of G, there is a path of length at most 5 from (v, s) to (k, t) in G via
elements of U.

Proof. By Lemma 3.4, there are (u, s), (n, t) in U such that there are edges between
them and (v, s), (k, t), respectively. From condition 2.1 and the deﬁnition of an
edge in G, we can see that there are edges from (u, s) to (0, s), from (n, t) to (0, t),
and from (0, s) to (0, t). Hence, (v, s), (u, s), (0, s), (0, t), (n, t) (k, t) is a path
of length 5, and if (u, s) = (n, t) then (v, s), (u, s), (k, t) is a path of length 2, by
the note after Lemma 3.4.

4 The Admissible Rotation Set

In this section, we will prove our main results: the admissible rotation set is convex;
and the rotation vectors of periodic trajectories of admissible type are dense in the
admissible rotation set. Again we will use ideas from [1] to prove these theorems.
There are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the proof of the ﬁrst theorem. For the second
theorem, the proof is omitted as it is the same as the one in [1] with minor change,
namely, the length of the admissible sequence C used in [1] will be diﬀerent in our
case.

Theorem 4.1 The admissible rotation set AR is convex.

Proof. Fix u, v in AR. We want to show that, for t ∈ (0, 1), tu + (1 − t)v is in
AR. Fix ǫ > 0.

Since u and v are in AR, there are two admissible sequences A, B and two tra-
jectory pieces T , S of type A and B, respectively, such that

x = p
q and p, q are in Z+. Clearly, this function of x is continuous on [0, 1], takes
values 0 at 0 and 1 at 1. Hence, the image of the set of rational numbers is dense
in [0, 1]. Therefore, we can approximate t by s with an arbitrary accuracy. Thus,
we can choose values for p and q such that

kt − sk ≤

ǫ
6k

, k = max{kuk, kvk}.

(4.2)

Now, by Lemma 3.4, there are admissible sequences C1, C2, C3 of length at most
5 via elements of U such that

D = AC1AC1......AC1AC2BC3BC3.....BC3B

is admissible, and so there is an admissible trajectory piece Q of type D by The-
orem 2.1. Assume that the block A appears p times on D and B appears q − p
times, where q > p. Let dA represents the displacement due to the repetition of
the block A, dB represents the displacement due to the repetition of the block B.
Then, as in [1],

kdA − pd(T )k ≤ 2pd

and

kdB − (q − p)d(S)k ≤ 2(q − p)d,

where d is maximal diameter of the obstacles. In addition, the displacement due
to each Ci is at most 5 + 2d, so the total displacement due to all those blocks is
at most (q − 1)(5 + 2d) < q(5 + 2d).

Thus

kd(Q) − pd(T ) − (q − p)d(S)k ≤ 2pd + 2(p − q)d + q(5 + 2d) = 4qd + 5q.

(4.3)

Similarly, by Note 2.4,

|| Q | −p | T | −(q − p) | S ||≤ 4qd + 5q.

Theorem 4.2 The rotation vectors of periodic orbits of admissible type are dense
in the admissible rotation set.

Proof. The proof in [1] is applied here. We just need to change the length of the
the admissible sequence C used in [1] to 5.

The following theorem is similar to Theorem 4.15 in [1].

Theorem 4.3 The admissible rotation set is a proper subset of the general rota-
tion set.

Proof. The proof in [1] shows that the admissible rotation set is contained in
the unit open ball. Here, we provide an example which shows that the vector
(1,0,0,0,....,0) is in the general rotation set. Consider the trajectory piece joining
the lowest point xk in the boundary of the lowest obstacle O(0,r0) in the hyper
cube with the leading vector 0 with the highest point yk in the boundary of the
highest obstacle in the hypercube with leading vector (k, −1, 0, 0, ..., 0), where k
is large enough so that the trajectory piece does not intersect any obstacles other
than those. Then as k goes to inﬁnity the ratio yk−xk

goes to (1, 0, 0, ..., 0).
