We present a consistent theoretical approach for calculating eﬀective nonlinear susceptibilities of
metamaterials taking into account both frequency and spatial dispersion. Employing the discrete
dipole model, we demonstrate that eﬀects of spatial dispersion become especially pronounced in
the vicinity of eﬀective permittivity resonance where nonlinear susceptibilities reach their maxima.
In that case spatial dispersion may enable simultaneous generation of two harmonic signals with
the same frequency and polarization but diﬀerent wave vectors. We also prove that the derived
expressions for nonlinear susceptibilities transform into the known form when spatial dispersion
eﬀects are negligible. In addition to revealing new physical phenomena, our results provide useful
theoretical tools for analysing resonant nonlinear metamaterials.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁeld of nonlinear metamaterials attracts signiﬁ-
cant research interest due to the numerous fascinating ap-
plications [1–4]. The use of large nonlinearities available
in resonant nonlinear metamaterials [1] opens a possibil-
ity to all-optical signal processing [5] and provides reach
opportunities to implement tunable and reconﬁgurable
photonic devices [6,7].

A fundamental task existing in the ﬁeld is characteriza-
tion of electromagnetic properties of nonlinear metama-
terials, i.e. homogenization. For many nonlinear scenar-
ios nonlinearity of metamaterials is described in a per-
turbative way in terms of nonlinear susceptibilities [8].
This allows one to exploit the framework of nonlinear
optics and directly compare nonlinearities of artiﬁcially
structured media with those occuring in natural crystals.
To date, a number of approaches to homogenize nonlin-
ear composites and metamaterials were reported [9–13].
However, most of these approaches do not take spatial
dispersion into account. Spatial dispersion (or nonlocal-
ity) implies the dependence of polarization of a physically
small volume on the ﬁelds existing in the neighboring re-
gions of space. A number of theoretical and experimen-
tal studies demonstrate that nonlocality is pronounced
in a wide class of linear metamaterials [14–17]. In linear
structures nonlocality is often described in terms of eﬀec-
tive permittivity tensor depending on both frequency and
wave vector. Comprehensive theoretical models describ-
ing nonlocality in linear artiﬁcial composites were devel-
oped [18–20] and, in particular, a generalization of the
Clausius-Mossotti formula for the case of discrete three-
dimensional (3D) metamaterial was proposed [19]. How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, the consistent theoret-
ical description of spatial dispersion eﬀects in nonlinear
metamaterials remains an open problem so far.

In this paper, we derive nonlocal nonlinear susceptibil-
ities of a 3D nonlinear metamaterial composed of uniax-
ial scatterers (Fig. 1). We employ the discrete dipole
model
[21–23] describing the ﬁeld of the scatterer in

dipole approximation, whereas the properties of the indi-
vidual meta-atom are characterized by linear and nonlin-
ear polarizability tensors. The rest of the paper is orga-
nized as follows. In Sec. II we derive general expressions
for nonlocal nonlinear susceptibilities of discrete meta-
material. Sec. III demonstrates that in the limiting case
when spatial dispersion eﬀects in the structure can be
neglected our results reduce to the known expressions for
local ﬁeld corrections. In Sec. IV we illustrate the main
features of the developed approach providing a numerical
example for the structure composed of short wires loaded
with varactor diodes. In particular, we highlight the es-
sential role of spatial dispersion eﬀects at frequencies in
the vicinity of eﬀective pemittivity resonance. Finally,
in Sec. V we discuss the obtained results. Calculation of
linear and nonlinear polarizabilities of a short varactor-
loaded wire is provided in Appendix.

II. NONLOCAL HOMOGENIZATION OF

DISCRETE NONLINEAR METAMATERIAL

We consider an array of nonlinear uniaxial meta-atoms
arranged in a cubic 3D lattice with the period a (Fig. 1).
Note that chaotic arrangement of the similar nonlinear
dipoles was studied in Ref. [24]. However, in that work
mutual interactions of meta-atoms were not considered.
In the present derivation we use the CGS system of units
and assume e−iωt time dependence of monochromatic
ﬁelds. We consider excitation of nonlinear structure by
an incident wave with frequency ω, denoting wave vector
of the fundamental wave propagating in the metamate-
rial by ~k. Due to the nonlinear nature of inclusions, the
incident wave generates polarization not only at the fun-
damental frequency ω, but also at frequencies 2 ω, 3 ω,
etc. This nonlinear polarization becomes a source of har-
monics at frequencies 2 ω, 3 ω, etc. In the present analy-
sis we consider only second and third harmonics omitting
nonlinear contributions of higher order. This is a typical
assumption for many nonlinear metamaterials [1]. Fur-
thermore, for the sake of simplicity we assume that the
scatterers can be polarized only along z axis. Then the
only essential components of linear and nonlinear sus-
ceptibility tensors would be χ(1)
zzzz. Ac-
cordingly, the subscript z is omitted further in the des-
ignations of vector and tensor components. Under these
assumptions the dipole moment d of the individual meta-
atom is given by the equations:

zzz and χ(3)

d(ω) = α1(ω) Etot(ω)+

tot(ω) .

(3)

where α1, α2 and α3 stand for linear, second- and third-
order nonlinear polarizabilities. The total ﬁeld Etot(ω)
is the sum of the external ﬁeld acting on the scatterer
E(ω) and ﬁeld associated with radiation friction [25]
Es(ω) = 2iω3 d(ω)/(3 c3).
In this case polarizabilities
introduced in Eqs. (1), (2), (3) are so-called bare polariz-
abilities, i.e. they do not contain the radiation loss con-
tribution [26]. Note that bare polarizability of a lossless
scatterer is purely real. An alternative description of ra-
diation losses incorporates an imaginary part into scat-
terer polarizability [23,26]. The latter approach, how-
ever, turns out to be less convenient for nonlinear struc-
tures. Linear polarizability α1(ω) along with nonlinear
polarizabilities α2 and α3 can be calculated for a partic-

2

ular scatterer. For example, the calculation of nonlinear
polarizabilities of varactor-loaded short wire is provided
in Appendix, whereas the analysis of nonlinear proper-
ties of varactor-loaded split-ring resonators is carried out
in Refs. [27–29]. It should be emphasized that the ﬁeld
E(ω) ≡ Etot(ω) − Es(ω) appearing in Eqs. (1), (2), (3)
is local ﬁeld, i.e. the electric ﬁeld in the point where the
scatterer is located. On the other hand, in the deﬁnition
of eﬀective material parameters the average ﬁeld appears.
The average ﬁelds are deﬁned as [18,20]

D ~E(Ω)E =
D ~P (Ω)E =

~E(Ω; ~r) e−i ~K·~r dV ,

~P (Ω; ~r) e−i ~K·~r dV ,

(4)

(5)

where V0 = a3 is a unit cell volume, Ω is arbitrary fre-
quency and vector function ~K = ~K(Ω) is speciﬁed later
in this section. The average structure polarization is

hP (Ω)i = d(Ω)/V0 ,

(6)

and the average electric ﬁeld can be related to the average
polarization by [20]

with

hE(Ω)i = Γk(Ω, ~K) d(Ω) ,

Γk(Ω; ~K) = −

4π

Ω2 − K 2

(7)

(8)

Local ﬁeld acting on the scatterer in the coordinate origin

can be evaluated via dyadic Green’s function [30] bG(Ω; ~r)

and dipole moments dmnl of metaatoms as

Gzz(Ω;−~rmnl) dmnl(Ω)

(9)

E(Ω) = X(m,n,l)6=(0,0,0)

where the indices m, n, l enumerate the lattice sites and
the dipole moments of the scatterers in the unbounded
structure are distributed as

dmnl(Ω) = d(Ω) ei ~K(Ω)·~rmnl .

(10)

The distribution of polarization at the fundamental fre-
quency is determined by the incident wave, and in this
case ~K(ω) = ~k, where ~k is a wave vector of the struc-
ture eigenmode. Since second-order nonlinear polariza-
tion is a quadratic function of the fundamental wave,
~K(2 ω) = 2 ~k and similarly ~K(3 ω) = 3 ~k. Thus, the ex-
pression for local ﬁeld can be represented as

E(Ω) = Gk(cid:16)Ω; ~K(Ω)(cid:17) d(Ω) ,

with the lattice sum deﬁned as

(11)

Gk(Ω; ~K) ≡ X(m,n,l)6=(0,0,0)

Gzz(Ω; ~r) e−i ~K·~rmnl .

(12)

Therefore, the total ﬁeld appearing in Eqs. (1), (2), (3)
is

Etot(Ω) = G′

k(cid:16)Ω, ~K(Ω)(cid:17) d(Ω)

(13)

k(Ω, ~K) = Gk(Ω, ~K) + 2i Ω3/(3 c3). Eﬀective al-
with G′
gorithms for the lattice sum rapid evaluation where de-
veloped earlier [23]. Importantly, it can be proved that
for real Ω and ~K Im G′
k(Ω, ~K) = 0 [23]. Making use of
Eqs. (13) and (1) it is easy to see that the dispersion
equation for the linear structure with the metaatom’s
polarizability α1(ω) has the form [23,31,32]

α−1
1 (ω) − G′

k(ω; ~k) = 0 .

Using Eqs. (7) and (11) we obtain

Etot(Ω) = Φ(Ω; ~K) hE(Ω)i

(14)

(15)

k(Ω; ~K)/Γk(Ω; ~K) is introduced for
where Φ(Ω; ~K) = G′
convenience. Making use of Eqs. (13) and (7), the rela-
tion between local and averaged ﬁelds can be also repre-

3

sented in the alternative form

Etot(Ω) = hE(Ω)i + Ck(Ω; ~K) d(Ω)

(16)

where Ck(Ω; ~K) = G′
k(Ω; ~K) − Γk(Ω; ~K) is the lattice
interaction constant. Finally, inserting the expressions
Eqs. (6), (15), (16) into Eqs. (1), (2), (3), we obtain the
relation between the averaged structure polarization and
the averaged ﬁeld:

hP (ω)i = χ(1)(ω, ~k) hE(ω)i +
2 χ(2)(ω; 2 ω,−ω, ~k) hE(2 ω)i hE(ω)i∗ +
3 χ(3)(ω; ω, ω,−ω, ~k) |hE(ω)i|2 hE(ω)i ,

hP (2 ω)i = χ(1)(2 ω, 2 ~k) hE(2 ω)i +
χ(2)(2 ω; ω, ω, 2 ~k) hE(ω)i2 ,

hP (3 ω)i = χ(1)(3 ω, 3 ~k) hE(3 ω)i +
2 χ(2)(3 ω; 2 ω, ω, 3 ~k) hE(2 ω)i hE(ω)i +
χ(3)(3 ω; ω, ω, ω, 3 ~k) hE(ω)i3 .

(17)

(18)

(19)

Nonlocal nonlinear susceptibilities in Eqs. (17), (18), (19)
can be written in a compact form as follows:

χ(2)(ω3; ω2, ω1, ~K(ω3)) =

χ(3)(ω4; ω3, ω2, ω1, ~K(ω4)) =

χ(1)(Ω, ~K) =

1 (ω4) − Ck(ω4, ~K(ω4))i−1

(22)

.

(20)

,

(21)

In Eq. (20), Ω = ω, 2 ω or 3 ω and ~K(Ω) = ~k, 2 ~k or
3 ~k, respectively.
In Eq. (21), ω3 = ω2 + ω1, the pair
(ω2, ω1) acquires the values (ω, ω), (2 ω, ω) and (2 ω,−ω).
In Eq. (22), ω4 = ω3 + ω2 + ω1, the triplet (ω3, ω2, ω1)
acquires the values (ω, ω, ω) and (ω, ω,−ω). Note that
Eqs. (20), (21) and (22) are valid for negative frequencies
in which case Φ(−Ω, ~K(−Ω)) ≡ Φ∗(Ω, ~K(Ω)).

Expressions (20), (21) and (22) depend implicitly on ~k
which is the solution of the dispersion equation for linear
structure Eq. (14). Therefore, one may easily calculate
nonlinear susceptibilities for a given direction of wave
propagation and fundamental frequency ω. Eqs. (20),
(21), (22) suggest that nonlinear suscepbilities depend
on the direction of wave propagation. Such eﬀect is one
of the manifestations of spatial dispersion. It is discussed
in detail in Sec. IV.

As additional evidence of the validity of our approach,
we notice that the obtained expression Eq. (20) for the
linear susceptibility of the structure coincides with the
result derived in Ref. [19]. Furthermore, in the case of
lossless scatterers and for the propagating mode with
real ω and ~k eﬀective nonlinear susceptibilities turn out
k(Ω, ~K) and
to be purely real because the quantities G′
Ck(Ω, ~K) are both real. This result satisﬁes energy con-
servation law.

III. COMPARISON WITH THE LOCAL

EFFECTIVE MEDIUM MODEL

In this section we demonstrate that in the limiting case
when K a ≪ 1 and Ω a/c ≪ 1, i.e. when spatial disper-

sion eﬀects in the structure are negligible, our results can
be reduced to local nonlinear susceptibilities well-known
from nonlinear optics. In this limit the interaction con-
stant for a cubic lattice [19,23]

Ck(Ω, ~K) = 4 π/(3 a3)

(23)

for any real and suﬃciently small Ω and ~K. As a re-
sult, eﬀective permittivity of the structure is given by
the Clausius-Mossotti formula [33]

εloc(ω) ≡ 1 + 4 π χ(1)

loc(ω) =

1 + 8 π α1(ω)/(3 a3)
1 − 4 π α1(ω)/(3 a3)

.

(24)

Equations (23) and (24) yield also that

(25)

and as a consequence of Eqs. (23), (26) and (14)

k(Ω, ~K(Ω)) ≡ Γk(Ω, ~K(Ω)) + Ck(Ω, ~K(Ω)) =
G′
Γk(ω, ~k) + Ck(ω, ~k) = G′

k(ω, ~k) = α−1

1 (ω) .

(27)

Expression for the factor Φ(Ω, ~K(ω)) can be transformed
using Eqs. (27) and (26) as follows:

Φ(Ω, ~K(Ω)) ≡

k(Ω, ~K(Ω))

Γ(Ω, ~K(Ω))

(28)
Thus, taking into account Eq. (24) we derive the simpli-
ﬁed expression for the factor Φ:

Φ(Ω, ~K(Ω)) =

εloc(ω) + 2

3

(29)

for any Ω = ω, 2 ω and 3 ω. Applying the simpliﬁed
expressions Eqs. (25) and (29) to the general formulas
Eqs. (21) and (22) we ﬁnally obtain:

Furthermore, from Eq. (8) it is straightforward that

Γ(Ω, ~K(Ω)) = Γ(ω, ~k) ,

(31)

In Eq. (30) ω3 = ω1 + ω2, in Eq. (31) ω4 = ω3 + ω2 + ω1.
Both equations are also applicable for negative frequency
values in accordance with ε(−Ω) ≡ ε∗(Ω). Essentially,
factors α2/a3 and α3/a3 describe second- and third-order
nonlinear susceptibilities in the case when interaction of
the scatterers is negligible. Factors (εloc + 2)/3 thus rep-
resent a local ﬁeld correction to the nonlinear suscep-
tibilities. The presented form of local ﬁeld corrections
is well-known in nonlinear optics [8]. Therefore, in the
limit of negligible spatial dispersion our results are consis-
tent with the previous studies based on the local eﬀective
medium approach.

IV. NUMERICAL EXAMPLE

Now we proceed to the demonstration of the main fea-
tures of the developed theoretical model for a particular
example. To this end we consider a 3D structure with the
period a = 1 cm composed of short wires (much shorter
than the wavelength) loaded by varactors Skyworks SMV
1231-079 [34] possessing nonlinear capacitance as well as
associated linear parameters. Varactor is inserted in the
gap of the size ∆l = 1.3 mm in the middle of the wire

with the radius r = 1 mm and half-length l = 3 mm. The
total inductance of varactor inclusion is Lt = 42.5 nH
and the capacitance determining the input impedance of
the wire (without varactor capacitance) is Ct = 0.2 pF.
Other varactor parameters are set to those speciﬁed by
the manufacturer [34]. For clarity, dispersion diagram is
shown for zero dissipation. However, nonlinear suscep-
tibilities are calculated with realistic losses according to
speciﬁcations [34].

The dispersion diagram of the described metamaterial
in linear regime of operation calculated with Eq. (14) is
presented in Fig. 2. Analysis of the calculated diagram
reveals that there are two frequency intervals where spa-
tial dispersion eﬀects are most pronounced. These fre-
quency intervals correspond to the so-called mixed dis-
persion regime studied in detail for linear uniaxial meta-
materials in Ref. [32]. Mixed dispersion regime arises at
frequencies in the vicinity of zeros [23,35] (low-ε mixed
regime) and poles [36] (high-ε mixed regime) of the struc-
ture local permittivity Eq. (24).

We expect the most signiﬁcant deviations of nonlinear
susceptibilities from the local eﬀective medium model to
occur in mixed dispersion regime. Note that in the low-ε
mixed regime the main manifestation of spatial disper-

account while describing nonlinearities of metamaterials
in the vicinity of permittivity resonance.

Another interesting manifestation of spatial dispersion
is the dependence of nonlinear susceptibilities on the di-
rection of propagation of the fundamental wave with re-
spect to the sample crystallographic axes. In Fig. 5 we
plot the dependence of linear and nonlinear susceptibili-
ties on the angle between the wave vector ~k and ΓX direc-
tion in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone of the crystal. Even though
a dependence of nonlinear susceptibilities on the propa-
gation direction is also known for photonic crystals [37],
it should be stressed that the metamaterial operates in
deeply subwavelength regime with the ratio λ/a ≈ 48

sion is the emergence of longitudinal waves propagating
closely to ΓZ direction [32]. Excitation of such longitu-
dinal modes is not simple in experiment. Therefore, we
concentrate on the analysis of transverse modes which are
strongly aﬀected by nonlocality in high-ε mixed regime.
In this example, high- and low-ε mixed regimes corre-
spond to the spectral ranges 0.565 < f < 0.670 GHz and
0.992 < f < 1.024 GHz, respectively, and frequency of
linear permittivity resonance is fr = 0.616 GHz.

Perturbative analysis of

the nonlinear oscillator
model [8] suggests that nonlinear susceptibilities χ(2) and
χ(3) are subject to resonant enhancement not only at
the frequency fr but also at frequencies fr/2 (χ(2), χ(3))
and fr/3 (χ(3) only) as explained in more details in Ap-
pendix. Therefore, we also studied metamaterial non-
linear properties in spectral intervals around fr/2 and
fr/3. Linear and nonlinear susceptibilities calculated
for ΓM direction of propagation by Eqs. (20), (21), (22)
are compared with the predictions of the local eﬀective
medium model Eqs. (24), (30), (31) in Figs. 3, 4. The re-
sults show that signiﬁcant deviations from the local eﬀec-
tive medium model indeed occur in high-ε mixed regime
whereas at lower frequency resonances fr/2 and fr/3 res-
onant enhancement of nonlinear susceptibilities is accu-
rately captured by the local model. Furthermore, it can
be noticed that spatial dispersion dumps the resonance
that leads to the decrease of the maximal achievable val-
ues of nonlinear susceptibility. Therefore, we conclude
that spatial dispersion should be necessarily taken into

at frequency fr. Nevertheless, variation of susceptibil-
ity with the direction of wave vector ~k reaches 4% for
χ(1) and χ(3) and 1% for χ(2) at the resonance frequency
fr = 0.616 GHz.
In general, at frequencies around fr
maximal variation of susceptibilities χ(1), χ(2) and χ(3)
with the direction of wave vector is 4-5%.

Finally, as Fig. 2b clearly shows,

in high-ε mixed
regime there are two solutions of the dispersion equa-
tion corresponding to the given frequency and ΓM or ΓX
directions of propagation. As a result, nonlinear sus-
ceptibilities Eqs. (21), (22) are multivalued functions of
frequency in this spectral range. Consequently, one may
expect that one TM-polarized incident beam can pro-
duce two second-harmonic (third-harmonic) beams with

the same polarization and frequency.
Importantly, the
described eﬀect arises purely due to spatial dispersion ef-
fects and cannot be explained in the framework of the
local eﬀective medium model.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a consistent theoretical approach
for calculating eﬀective nonlinear susceptibilities of non-
linear discrete metamaterials taking into account both
frequency and spatial dispersion. We have modelled non-
linear metamaterial as a lattice of nonlinear uniaxial elec-
tric dipoles, and obtained closed-form expressions for ef-
fective nonlinear parameters. It has been demonstrated
that spatial dispersion aﬀects strongly nonlinear prop-

erties of metamaterials in the vicinity of eﬀective per-
mittivity resonance dumping the frequency variation of
nonlinear susceptibilities in comparison to the models of
local eﬀective media. We have predicted that, due to the
spatial dispersion eﬀects, one incident light beam may
produce two harmonic beams with the same polarization.
Additionally, we have demonstrated the dependence of
nonlinear susceptibilities on the direction in which the
fundamental harmonic propagates with respect to the
crystallographic axes. Our results suggest that nonlo-
cality is important in metamaterials even if they operate
in a deeply subwavelength regime. Furthermore, we have
veriﬁed that our results yield an accurate form of the
so-called local ﬁeld corrections to the nonlinear suscep-
tibilities when spatial dispersion eﬀects become negligi-
ble. Our conclusions are also valid for three-dimensional
arrays of uniaxial magnetic scatterers such as varactor-
loaded split-ring resonantors. We believe that our study
provides important insights into the characterization of
nonlinear metamaterials exhibiting large resonant non-
linearities.

Appendix. Linear and nonlinear polarizabilities of a

short varactor-loaded wire

In this appendix we derive expressions characteriz-
ing linear and nonlinear properties of a short (2 l ≪ λ)
varactor-loaded wire. Varactor is described by the non-
linear capacitance as well as associated linear parame-
ters. Nonlinearity in such meta-atom arises due to the
voltage-dependent varactor capacitance that is well ap-

where U is deemed positive in the case of reverse var-
actor bias.
In the case of varactor SMV 1231-079, the
parameters in Eq. (32) are as follows [34]: M = 4.999,
CJ0 = 1.88 pF and UJ = 10.13 V.

Making use of the deﬁnition C = dq/dU one can relate

reverse voltage on the varactor UV to its charge q:

UV (q) = UJ "(cid:18)1 +

(33)

Under the assumption |q| ≪ CJ0 UJ the right-hand side
of Eq. (33) can be expanded in a series with respect to q:

UV (q) =

arranged to yield

where Q is the total charge stored by both varactor and
parasitic capacitance Cp, and C0 = CJ0 + Cp. Denot-
ing the inductance and resistance of the entire varactor
inclusion by Lt and Rt, respectively, we obtain the non-
linear oscillator equation for the total charge stored in
the system:

¨Q + 2 β0 ˙Q + ω2

To calculate linear and nonlinear polarizabilities, we
