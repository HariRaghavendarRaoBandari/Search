Initial State Independent Equilibration at the Breakdown of the Eigenstate

Thermalization Hypothesis

This work aims at understanding the interplay between the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis
(ETH), initial state independent equilibration and quantum chaos in systems that do not have a
direct classical counterpart. It is based on numerical investigations of asymmetric Heisenberg spin
ladders with varied interaction strengths between the legs, i.e., along the rungs. The relaxation of
the energy diﬀerence between the legs is investigated. Two diﬀerent parameters, both intended to
quantify the degree of accordance with the ETH, are computed. Both indicate violation of the ETH
at large interaction strengths but at diﬀerent thresholds. Indeed the energy diﬀerence is found not to
relax independently of its initial value above some critical interaction strength which coincides with
one of the thresholds. At the same point the level statistics shift from Poisson-type to Wigner-type.
Hence the system may be considered to become integrable again in the strong interaction limit.

INTRODUCTION

Even in closed quantum systems one may observe re-
laxation, in spite of time evolution being generated by
unitary operations. This statement has many aspects,
it may imply that a reduced density matrix of a part of
some system approaches a thermal state [3, 4, 7, 42], it
may imply that expectation values of speciﬁc observables
evolve more or less against constant values [1, 43], or it
may additionally even imply that these constant values
do not depend on the initial state [1, 17, 44]. It is this lat-
ter initial state independence (ISI) which is in the focus of
the paper at hand. Among the concepts addressing this
issue is the so called eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
(ETH) [9, 10]. According to the ETH, the expectation
values of a typical observable ˆD as computed from energy
eigenstates |ni should be a smooth function of energy En
, i.e., hn| ˆD|ni ≈ hn′| ˆD|n′i = ¯Deq(E) if En ≈ En′ ≈ E.
As is well known, if the ETH applies, the long time aver-
ages of all expectation value Tr{ ˆρ ˆD(t)} corresponding to
any initial state ˆρ that lives inside some energy shell, are
equal [36]. Furthermore, if the spectrum of the Hamilto-
nian ˆH is “non-resonant” (roughly speaking: any energy
diﬀerence occurs only once) and the ρnn are fairly spread
over the energy shell, then the actual Tr{ ˆρ ˆD(t)} devi-
ates from its long time average very rarely [6]. Hence,
the three features, i. ETH agreement, ii. non-resonant
spectrum and iii. dilute eigenstate occupation, guaran-
tee the initial state independent (ISI) relaxation of the
expectation value towards a speciﬁc “equilibrium” value.
Since this behavior is observed and expected for prac-
tically all physical relaxation phenomena, the question
arises whether the above three features apply to all those

situations. This question has been approached from the
perspective of quantum chaos, and various rigorous re-
sults exist that suggest i. and ii. apply to systems which
have a direct classical counterpart which is chaotic [17].
Much less is known for systems that do not have a di-
rect classical counterpart [10]. However, while the three
features are suﬃcient for ISI, they are not necessary in
a mathematical sense: classes of initial states exist that
exhibit ISI even though the ETH may not apply. Some
papers put much more emphasis on the extremely high
relative frequency with which ISI may be expected if ini-
tial state are drawn essentially at random from some pre-
scribed sets, rather than on the ETH [5, 7, 43, 46]. How-
ever, it may be the case that the relative frequency of
initial states from the above sets, that exhibit a signif-
icant deviation of the respective expectation value from
its equilibrium value at all, even at t = 0, is very low. In
this case results of relative-frequency-type would imply
the existence of a majority of states the expectation val-
ues of which start and remain in equilibrium. However,
no conclusions on state, that actually do exhibit non-
equilibrium expectation values in the beginning, could
be drawn.

In view of this, a class of initial states that are speciﬁ-
cally tailored to exhibit largely deviating expectation val-
ues, but live in narrow energy shells at the same time has
recently been suggested [12]. These states (which will be
explained in detail below) have been termed microcanon-
ical observable displaced (MOD) states. MOD states are
“natural” in the sense that they may be viewed as results
of state determination according to Jayne’s principle un-
der the conditions of a given expectation value and the
state living in an certain energy shell. For the remainder
of this paper we focus on dynamics as resulting from such
initial MOD states.

In order to set the content of the paper at hand in
context to the state of research, we need to specify our

notion of ETH in somewhat more detail. Consider

¯D =

d

Xn=1

pn Dnn , Σ2 =

d

Xn=1

pn D2

nn − ¯D2 ,

(1)

where Dnn are diagonal matrix elements with respect
to the Hamiltonian eigenstates |ni with eigenvalues En,
pn ∝ e−(En− ¯E)2/2σ2
E is a probability distribution centered
at ¯E, and d is the Hilbert-space dimension. The quan-
tities ¯D( ¯E, σE) and Σ( ¯E, σE) are obviously functions of
¯E and an energy width σE. Routinely, the ETH is said
to be fulﬁlled if Σ is small for small σE. Technically, ISI
equilibration is only guaranteed for all initial states from
a given energy window σE at ¯E iﬀ Σ = 0, [37]. If instead
a ﬁnte-size scaling scheme is employed, i.e., Σ → 0 for
N → ∞ (N being the “system-size”, e.g., the number
of spins, etc.) not only the Hamiltonian, but also the
observable ˆD often scales with N in some fashion as well
(cf. below). In this context it is relevant to note that ISI
equilibration is only ensured if Σ itself approaches zero
in the limit of large system sizes, the vanishing of, e.g.,
Σ2/N , is not suﬃcient. However, in our analysis we do
not intend to demonstrate ISI equilibration for all initial
states of a given energy window but rather focus on the
afore mentioned special class of states, i.e., MOD states.
Below we will employ a quantiﬁer which is closely related
to Σ but independent of the scaling of the observable it-
self.

In order to put our work into perspective, we list some
exemplary results from the literature on the generic scal-
ing properties of Σ, and classify our results in relation
to these. In the context of translational invariant, solid-
state type observables and models, the observable is fre-
quently deﬁned to scale “extensively”, like, e.g., a cur-
rent, a total kinetic energy, etc.
In this case, there is
substantial numerical evidence that Σ scales more or less
as Σ ∝ d−γ
ef f , where def f is the eﬀective dimension, i.e.,
the number of states within the respective energy shell
and γ is some constant [22, 38, 45]. Note, however, that
the scaling behavior of Σ generally depends strongly on
whether the observable itself is deﬁned to scale exten-
sively, intensively or else. Since the eﬀective dimension
def f usually increases (exponentially) with system size, Σ
tends to zero with increasing system size whenever γ > 0.
The existing literature contains numerous examples ex-
hibiting 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1/2 for few body observables. γ = 0
appears to be related to integrable systems, γ = 1/2 for
fully chaotic systems, where both deﬁnitions may vary
depending on the respective authors [47].

In Ref. [38], however, also examples are discussed with
γ < 0 for extensive observables, i.e., the unscaled Σ it-
self increases with system size. This occurs for spin and
energy currents in the (integrable) Heisenberg chain at
some parameter regime. In contrast to that, in Ref. [12]
the same Heisenberg chain model is investigated while
the considered observable is diﬀerent, namely the energy
diﬀerence between two parts of the chain. The latter
observable is also extensive. Nonetheless, in this case

2

Σ = const, i.e., γ = 0 is found. As already mentioned
above, for γ ≤ 0 ISI equilibration is not guaranteed, i.e.,
the construction of initial states for which the expecta-
tion value of ˆD does not decay towards the corresponding
equilibrium ensemble value is always possible. Thus we
will primarily focus on the question whether such a “in-
complete decaying” occurs for MOD states for models
and observables exhibiting γ ≤ 0.

For the remainder of this paper we follow [12] in inves-
tigating the (extensive) energy diﬀerence between cer-
tain system sections. We present a model that allows
for a continuous tuning of the scaling parameter γ all
the way from γ > 0 to γ < 0, i.e., depending on some
system parameter, Σ either decreases, remains constant
or increases under upscaling of the system-size. We also
follow [12] in considering an alternative parameter v for
the “prediction” of ISI for MOD states:

v = (cid:18) Σ

δD(cid:19)2

(2)

D = Σd

D denotes the spectral variance of the observable ˆD in
δ2
n=1pn( ˆD2)nn −
the respective energy shell, i.e., δ2
( ¯D)2 (the bars over D symbolize the averaging as deﬁned
in Eq. (1)). Note that v is, other than Σ, dimensionless.
Thus for the scaling behavior of v, the scaling behavior
of the observable itself (extensive, intensive or else) is
irrelevant. It has been proposed that ISI for MOD states
occurs, if and only if v → 0 in the limit of large systems.
Although closely related to the ETH, the v criterion is
not quite the same, for it may possibly approach zero
even if Σ increases, if δ2

D increases more quickly.

The present paper is organized as follow: In section
II, we shortly introduce the investigated models and the
addressed observable, i.e., the energy diﬀerence. In sec-
tion III, we present the results on Σ, v in dependence
of the tuning parameter κ and show the existence of two
diﬀerent regimes based on the scaling behavior of the for-
mer. The computations in Sec. IV clarify whether MOD
states give rise to ISI relaxation of the energy diﬀerence
and how this relates to the results of Sec.III. We discuss
the integrability of the model at hand in Sec. V using
the generalized Brody parameter, whose behavior turns
to be correlated to the ETH parameter v. Finally, we
close with summary and conclusion.

II. MODELS AND OBSERVABLES

The model we address in this work is an asymmetrical
Heisenberg-ladder which consists of two XXZ spin-1/2
chains of diﬀerent length, coupled along some “rungs”
with interaction strength κ, cf. Fig. 1. The total Hamil-
ton operator is given as follow

ˆH = ˆHL + ˆHR + κ ˆHI

III. COMPUTATION OF ETH-QUANTIFYING

PARAMETERS

3

Numerical computation of ETH related data like Σ, ¯D,
etc. for large systems is not a trivial task. Usually, it re-
quires exact diagonalization [11, 12, 38] that is limited to
rather small system sizes. Thus, we apply a recently sug-
gested method [18] that is based on dynamical typicality
and allows for the extraction of information about ETH
from the temporal propagation of pure states. This prop-
agation can be performed by iterative algorithms such as
Runge-Kutta [18, 20, 21], Chebyshev [23, 24] etc. and is
feasible for larger system sizes. We use a Chebyshev iter-
ator with reasonably small time step in order to improve
the computation accuracy. Due to typicality-related rea-
sons, the so-computed quantities ¯D and Σ are subjected
to statistical errors. These errors, however, turn out to
be small. Apart from the model size N = 14, which is
treated by exact diagonalization (LAPACK-routine), all
data in this section has been computed using the above
technique. This way we are able to address systems up
to N = 26.

We focus on a narrow energy shell around E = 0 which
is the energy regime with the highest density of states.
More precisely we choose ¯E = 0 and σE = 0.6. To set
this into perspective, the total energy range of this type
of model is on the order of N . The results for the ETH-
ﬂuctuations Σ are depicted in ﬁgure 2(a).

Figure 2(a) indicates that there are two clearly distinct
regimes: Above κ = 3.7 a convergence of the ETH pa-
rameter Σ to zero appears unlikely, even though the pre-
sented data may not allow for the precise determination
of Σ in the large system limit. At κ = 3.7 a simple linear
scaling also indicates a non-zero Σ in the large system
limit, even though the presented data may no be entirely
conclusive. However, below κ = 3.5 Fig. 2(a) clearly
indicates Σ → 0 for N → ∞. Thus for κ ≥ 3.7 the con-
sidered model potentially shows no ISI relaxation of the
energy diﬀerences between the two chains. This is to be
contrasted with the overall concept of heat conduction or
the second law of thermodynamics, which demands that
energy eventually distributes evenly over all parts of a
system, regardless of how uneven it was distributed in
the beginning.

Figure 2(b) displays the ETH parameter v which has
been suggested as a “detector” of ISI relaxation [12].
While the behavior of Σ and v may appear similar at
ﬁrst sight, there are relevant diﬀerences: for all κ ≤ 3.7
v clearly vanishes in the limit of large systems, whereas
at κ = 4.0 a more or less constant scaling occurs for
N ≥ 20. Thus the “switching” from vanishing to non-
vanishing values in the large system limit appears to oc-
cur at κ ≈ 3.7 for Σ, whereas it occurs at κ ≈ 4.0 for
v.

parameter, which is kept at ∆ = 0.1 throughout the en-
tire investigation. NL, NR are the numbers of spins with
respect to left and right spin chain respectively, thus the
total number of spins is N = NL + NR. We choose
NL = 2NR − 1 in order to suppress symmetry, since for
the symmetrical case the ETH is trivially fulﬁlled. The
two subsystems are allowed to exchange energy through
the interaction Hamiltonian, which reads

Obviously, at any non-zero κ, this model is not accessible
by a Bethe ansatz. Thus, in this sense it is always non-
integrable. For a more detailed discussion of integrability,
see Sec. V

The observable we are going to investigate is the energy
diﬀerence operator ˆD = ˆHL − ˆHR. Our motivation for
this particular choice stems form the intuitive example
of two the cups of coﬀee brought into contact with each
other, where one anticipate more or less an uniform en-
ergy density throughout the system. The model (3) has
been numerically studied in detail for weak interactions,
where the ETH turned out to be valid [12],

INVESTIGATION OF ISI-RELAXATION OF

ENERGY DIFFERENCES FROM INITIAL

MOD-STATES

In this section we are going to discuss the long time
behavior of hD(t)i as resulting from initial states from the
class of MOD states. The latter are deﬁned as follows:

ρMOD :∝ e(−( ˆH−H0ˆ1)2−β 2( ˆD−D0ˆ1)2)/2σ2

.

(5)

These states may be viewed as being based on Jayne’s
principle: They represents the maximum-entropy states
under given means and variances for the energy and the
observable. Since ˆH and ˆD do not commute with each
other, it is not possible to generate states with arbitrary
values of total energy energy h ˆHiMOD, energy diﬀerence
h ˆDiMOD and the respective variances. However, by tun-
ing the parameters H0, D0, β, σ, carefully, we are able to
prepare initial states having a well-deﬁned energy width
σE ≈ 0.6 around E = 0 and exhibiting initial expectation
values for the observable D(0) = h ˆDiMOD, which devi-
ate strongly from their corresponding equilibrium values

4

Deq; more quantitatively, hDiMOD reaches about 50% of
the diﬀerence between its highest possible value and its
long-time average. To enable such strong deviations we
choose D0 = ±(NL − 2) throughout all investigations.
This is to be contrasted with various quench scenarios
[25, 26], where the initial deviations from the equilibrium
value are rather small. Note also that such MOD states
do not necessarily feature a smooth probability distribu-
tion with respect to the corresponding energy eigenbasis,
as required by Ref. [15] in order to establish ISI.

Neither constructing states of the MOD-type (5) nor
propagating such states according to the Schroedinger
equation is numerically simple for larger systems. Thus,
we instead prepare and evolve a corresponding pure state
|φMODi, which exhibits, up to very small statistical errors
the same hD(t)i as ρMOD:

|φMODi = hϕ|ρMOD|ϕi−1/2 ρ1/2

MOD |ϕi ,

(6)

where |ϕi is a random state drawn according to the uni-
tary invariant (Haar-) measure. This concept relies on
dynamical typicality and has been explained and applied
in e.g, [12, 20, 34, 38].

As an example the time evolutions of hD(t)i for
D(0) = ±7, N = 26 and two diﬀerent interaction
strengths, namely κ = 3, 4.5, are displayed in Fig. 3 First

Figure 3: Time evolution of hD(t)iM OD for various interaction
strengths starting at D0 = ±7 for systems of size N = 26. In
case of κ = 3.0, ISI equilibration is obvious but for κ = 4.5 the
expectation value converges against ﬁnite oﬀsets indicating
that some portion of the initial value persists (see text for
details). Note that due to slightly diﬀerent |D(0)| occurring
for κ = 4.5 the ”equilibrium values” for corresponding curves
also slightly diﬀer.

of all one should note that the non resonance condition
and the dilute eigenstate occupation principle obviously
apply since in all instances hD(t)i converges against con-
stant values with time. However, while the energy dif-

ference hD(t)i clearly vanishes quickly for κ = 3.0 (as
required by the validity of the ETH) this is not the case
at κ = 4.5. There it appears that a ﬁxed portion of
the initial value persists. Hence, this system indeed par-
tially preserves an uneven distribution of local energy
in the long time limit, which may be viewed to be at
odds with the principle of heat conduction. This ﬁnd-
ing motivates the introduction of the “ISI quantifying”
parameter Λ, which we deﬁne as the long time equilib-
rium value divided by the initial expectation value. Since
the preserved portion seems to be more or less indepen-
dent of actual D0, we calculated only dynamics featuring
D0 = NL − 2. Thus, the deﬁnition of the ”ISI quantify-
ing” parameter reads

Λ =

hφMOD|D(t)|φMODi
hφMOD|D(0)|φMODi

with t ≫ τ ,

(7)

where τ is the relaxation time. Obviously Λ = 0 indicates
ISI whereas larger Λ indicate a violation of ISI. Further-
more, note that Λ, like v, is insensible with respect to
scaling of observables with system size and hence applies
to any kind of observable. We computed Λ for three dif-
ferent interaction strengths κ for increasing system sizes.
The result is displayed in Fig. 4 Clearly Λ vanishes in

behavior corresponds rather accurately to the ﬁnite size scal-
ing behavior of v, cf. Fig. 1. Statistical errors are of order of
symbol size.

the limit of large system for κ = 3.7, thus ISI relaxation
holds at this interaction strength. At and above κ = 4,
Λ appears to converge against non-zero values, hence no
ISI relaxation exists at these interaction strengths, not

5

even for N → ∞. This result should be discussed in re-
lation to the results of Sec. III. Obviously the transition
form ISI to non-ISI with increasing interaction strength
happens at the same point at which v starts to converge
against non-zero values. Thus the behavior of v predicts
ISI rather precisely. Σ, on the other hand, starts to con-
verge against non-zero values at κ > 3.5, i.e., in a regime
in which ISI is still present. Thus, in this sense, v ap-
pears to be a more reliable predictor of ISI than Σ. This
is one of the main results of this paper.

V.

INTEGRABILITY INVESTIGATIONS

So far, we focused on the issue of ISI equilibration
of a speciﬁc observable and found the existence of two
regimes, ISI and non-ISI, depending on the interaction
strength. Next we address the existence of an integrable
regime in the model at hand and study its relevance for
the emergence of ISI for the MOD states. Again, similar
to the discussion of ETH and ISI, a range of papers
more or less explicitly states that non-integrability is
imperative for ISI [14], whereas other works analyze ISI
without even mentioning integrability. Also diﬀerent
features of “statistical relaxation” ( other than ISI) are
addressed; examples exist in which the occurrence of
statistical relaxation does not depend on integrability
[19]. However, this type of
investigation generally
suﬀers from a conceptual shortcoming:
there is no
unambiguous deﬁnition for integrability in quantum
mechanics. Contrary to classical mechanics notions
like phase space, Lyapunov exponents and ergodicity
are not well deﬁned.
In the context of lattice particle
systems, quantum integrability is sometimes associated
with being accessible by the Bethe ansatz,
i.e., the
1D quantum Heisenberg-chain with nearest neighbor
interaction [29], the 1-D δ-function interacting Bose
[30] and the Fermi [31] gases are considered as inte-
grable. According to this later deﬁnition the model
considered in this paper is integrable. Nevertheless, the
break down of the ETH for large interaction strength
may be viewed as being due to the proximity of the
integrable (according to any standard deﬁnition) limit
of non-interacting spin-dimers. In order to address and
quantify this possible integrability, we resort to the well
known approach which is based on the Nearest Neighbor
Level Spacing Distribution (NNSD) denoted by P (∆ǫ)
[39, 40]. The distinction between integrability and chaos
is as follows:
if the most frequent energy spacing is
approaching zero ∆ǫ = 0 and the shape of the NNSD
mimics a Poisson distribution, the system is considered
to be integrable. Whereas, if the most frequent energy
spacing takes some ﬁnite value (level repulsion) with
an NNSD shape of Wigner-Dyson type, the system is
considered to be non-integrable. This classiﬁcation of
quantum systems using level statistics has been derived
in the context of quantum models, whose corresponding
classical counterparts are chaotic [32] and has been

adopted even for quantum systems which do not have
classical counterpart,.e.g., spin systems.

For most ﬁnite systems of condensed matter type the
NNSD turns out not to correspond exactly neither to
Poisson nor Wigner-Dyson like distributions. To deal
with intermediate statistics, Brody proposed in Ref. [33]
to compare each real NNSD to a one parameter ω-family
of analytically given NNSD’s, where ω = 0 corresponds
to pure Poisson and ω = 1 to pure Wigner statistics.
Matching a real NNSD to a pertinent Brody-NNSD thus
yields a speciﬁc ω that may be used to quantify the close-
ness to either Poisson or Wigner, respectively. Following
this scheme, we computed (by means of exact diagonal-
ization) and normalized an NNSD for various interac-
tion strengths and NR = 6 in a narrow energy interval
around E = 0. The results, for κ = 0.3, 4.0, together
with the matching Brody NNSD’s are displayed in Fig.
5. Obviously the agreement is rather good. This justi-

ﬁes the usage of the above described method to quantify
the “degree of integrability” by means of the parameter
ω. Finally, Fig. 6 displays ω as a function of κ together
with the ETH parameter v. First one should note that for
large interaction strengths the NNSD is much closer to
Poisson than to Wigner. This indicates that this model
class may indeed become integrable again for stronger
interactions, say κ ≈ 3.7, which are nonetheless far away
from the integrable dimer limit at κ ≫ 1. To repeat, this
integrability is not induced by the possibility of apply-
ing a Bethe ansatz. We are furthermore unable to judge
whether this integrability may be explained by stretch-
ing the quantum KAM theorem [48] all the way down

Figure 6: Comparison of Brody parameter ω and alternative

integrable systems indicated by ω obviously coincides with
the transition from the ISI to non-ISI regime, respectively.
This links the equilibration dynamics to quantum chaos; see
text for details. Note that that ω is gained from systems of
N = 14 whereas v is gained from systems of size N = 20.

from κ → ∞ to κ ≈ 3.7. However, it is striking that the
transition from ISI to non-ISI (indicated by increasing
v) happens at the very same point at which the NNSD
changes from Wigner to Poisson (indicated by decreas-
ing ω). While this ﬁnding is just based on numerics in
suggests that “chaoticity” in the sense of a large Brody
parameter may indeed be a suﬃcient criterion for the ISI
relaxation of few-body observables for systems starting
in MOD states. Investigations on diﬀerent spin systems
that point in a similar direction [38] also exist.

VI. TOWARDS THE PHYSICS BEHIND THE

NUMERICAL FINDINGS

While the numerical results clearly indicate a break-
down of “chaoticity” as well as of full relaxation of diﬀer-
ences of local energies at strong couplings, the physical
reason for this behavior is yet unclear. In the following
we shortly speculate about such physical reasons, thus
arriving at at some suggestions for further research.
All our ﬁndings refer to exchange of local energy between
two asymmetric legs of a ladder.
It may, however, be
elucidating to consider the exchange of local energy be-
tween the part of the system that is a regular ladder
(upper part in Fig. 1) and the part that consists of the
“elongation” of one leg that really is just a chain (lower
part in Fig. 1). If energy exchange between these two
parts (ladder and chain) is suppressed, this will result

in a suppression of energy exchange between the original
asymmetric legs, since the two energy-diﬀerences surely
have an overlap in the sense of a Mazur inequality [49].
Thus taking the “ladder and chain” point of view, two
features are evident: In the limit of large κ the mean
level spacing in the ladder will eventually become signif-
icantly larger than the mean level spacing in the chain.
Furthermore, the chain is integrable in the sense of a
Bethe-Ansatz, whereas the ladder is not. Regarding the
increasing level spacing in the chain, it may be the case
that transitions that amount to an exchange of local en-
ergy become more and more oﬀ-resonant. If the coupling
strength (here: between ladder and chain, i.e., not κ)
remains constant but the coupling becomes rather oﬀ-
resonant, the relaxation of the respective observable may
eventually not only be slowed down but inhibited com-
pletely [50]. Concerning the integrability, the eigenstates
of the chain may in principle be described by a respec-
tive set of rapidities, whereas this is not applicable to
the eigenstates of the ladder. This structural diﬀerence
between the eigenstates may cause the eigenstates of the
chain to scatter strongly at the interface, thus prevent-
ing them from penetrating deeply into the ladder. This
could also lead to an eﬀective suppression of the transi-
tions that facilitate an exchange of local energy.
Deciding which of the two above schemes is (if at all)
dominantly responsible for the inhibition of the exchange
of local energy is beyond the scope of the present paper.
Future research, however, could focus on the “ladder and
chain partition” and take more variables, other than just
local energy diﬀerences into account.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

The paper at hand aims at clarifying the interrelations
between the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH),

7

initial state independent relaxation and chaos in quan-
tum systems. The investigations are of primarily numer-
ical character and focus on a class of (asymmetric) ladder
type spin systems with variable interaction strength be-
tween the legs. We investigated the energy diﬀerence
between the legs of the spin system where we found that
two ETH quantifying parameters, a standard one and an
alternative, recently suggested one, indicate violation of
the ETH, even in the limit of large systems above certain
“threshold” interaction strengths. However, the thresh-
olds diﬀer for the standard and the alternative ETH pa-
rameter.
Furthermore, the relaxation behavior of the energy dif-
ference between the legs of the spin system is analyzed
for a speciﬁc class of initials states. It is found that those
energy diﬀerences no longer equilibrate to zero above a
certain interaction strength. This interaction strength
precisely coincides with the ETH violation threshold of
the alternative ETH parameter but not with the thresh-
old of the standard one.
Finally the level spacing statistics are considered.
It
turns out that they shift from Poisson-type to Wigner-
Dyson type with increasing interaction strengths, again
rather distinctly at the threshold of the alternative ETH
parameter. To conclude: numerical evidence suggests
that the alternative ETH parameter reliably signals the
relaxation of an observable towards a common value
that is independent of the initial, possibly largely oﬀ-
equilibrium value of the respective observable. Moreover
there appears to be a strong correlation of this alterna-
tive parameter with either chaotic or integrable type of
level statistics.
