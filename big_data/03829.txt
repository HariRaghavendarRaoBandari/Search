Recent studies of heavy-fermion systems with tunable quantum ﬂuctuations have focused on a variety of
zero-temperature phase transitions that involve not only the onset of magnetic order but also the destruction of
Kondo entanglement. Motivated by these developments, we investigate the effect of enhanced quantum ﬂuctu-
ations induced by a transverse magnetic ﬁeld in an Ising-anisotropic Kondo lattice model, solved within an ex-
tended dynamical mean ﬁeld theory using the numerical renormalization group. A line of locally critical points
describes a direct transition from a Kondo-screened paramagnetic heavy-fermion state to a Kondo-destroyed
antiferromagnetic phase. Along the line, the extracted critical exponents remain unchanged. By probing the the
interplay between quantum ﬂuctuations of the local moments, the Kondo effect, and magnetic order, this study
provides signiﬁcant new insight into the global phase diagram of heavy-fermion systems.

Heavy-fermion materials have provided condensed mat-
ter physics with some of its most challenging yet fascinat-
ing problems.
In the recent past, these materials have also
presented a canonical setting to study non-Fermi liquid be-
havior in the context of quantum criticality [1]. Inspired by
the unusual quantum critical properties of prototypical sys-
tems such as YbRh2Si2 [2–4], CeCu6−xAux [5], and CeRhIn5
[6, 7], several authors [8, 9] proposed the global phase dia-
gram (GPD) sketched in Fig. 1(a).
In the form relevant to
the present work, the GPD addresses the fundamental role of
quantum ﬂuctuations and their effects on the basic Doniach
picture [10]: in addition to the ratio of the bare Kondo scale
T (0)
K to the RKKY interaction scale I [the horizontal axis of
Fig. 1(a)], there is a second axis characterized by a quantity G
that measures the quantum ﬂuctuations of the local-moment
magnetism. The GPD naturally incorporates Kondo destruc-
tion and the associated local quantum criticality [6, 11], which
describes a direct transition (at temperature T = 0) between
(i) a paramagnetic phase with a large Fermi surface (PL) in-
duced by the Kondo effect and (ii) an antiferromagnetically
ordered phase with a small Fermi surface (AFS) produced
by Kondo destruction. Such a phase diagram appears perti-
nent to a variety of strongly correlated systems beyond heavy
fermions, such as the organic charge-transfer salts [13] and
high-Tc cuprates [14].

The GPD has had considerable inﬂuence on the understand-
ing and classiﬁcation of quantum critical heavy-fermion met-
als with respect to variations of dimensionality [15], geomet-
rical frustration [16–20], or otherwise tunable quantum ﬂuctu-
ations [21–24]. However, there have been very few concrete
theoretical calculations investigating the nature of the phase
transitions. An important open question [5, 8, 9] is whether
there is indeed a line of local critical points where the Kondo
destruction occurs simultaneously with the formation of long-
range order, as crossed by the Type-I trajectories shown in
Fig. 1(a), or only a single point that is multi-critical.

In this work, we present the ﬁrst theoretical study of this
outstanding issue, carried out by incorporating into an Ising-
anisotropic Kondo lattice model the effect of tunable quantum
ﬂuctuations induced by a transverse magnetic ﬁeld. Our main

result, summarized in Fig. 1(b), is the existence of a line of
continuous type-I transitions. Along this line, the critical be-
havior is shown to exhibit little variation for transverse ﬁelds
smaller than a bare Kondo scale, with the dynamical proper-
ties satisfying a remarkable superscaling.

Model and solution method: We study a Kondo lattice
model with Ising anisotropy of the spin exchange between lo-
cal moments, and tune the quantum ﬂuctuations of the local
moments through an external transverse ﬁeld. The Hamilto-
nian reads

The ﬁrst term represents the kinetic energy of a band of spin-
2 conduction while the second describes an SU (2)-invariant
1
Kondo coupling at each site i between a local impurity spin
Si and the on-site spin density of the conduction electrons si.
The third term in HKLM is a exchange coupling between the z
components of the local moments. Although this coupling is
generated by the previous terms to second-order in the Kondo
exchange and corresponds to the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-
Yosida (RKKY) interaction, we include it separately in order
to tune the magnetic ﬂuctuations. The last term in Eq. (1) in-
troduces the transverse ﬁeld ∆. We note that, (i) the role of
transverse ﬁeld in the (local-moment) quantum Ising model
is well studied [26, 27]; (ii) for two-dimensional magnetic
ﬂuctuations in the absence of the transverse ﬁeld, the Ising-
anisotropic Kondo lattice has been shown to display a locally
critical point [3, 4, 6–8, 11]; (iii) an easy-axis anisotropy is ob-
served in a number of heavy-fermion systems [5, 17, 33, 34].
We study the Hamiltonian (1) using the extended dynamical
mean-ﬁeld theory (EDMFT) approach [35]. The conduction-
electron Green’s function and the lattice susceptibilities take
the forms (for real frequencies)

Gσ(k, ω) = [ω − k − Σσ(ω)]−1,
χ(q, ω) = [Iq + M (ω)]−1.

FIG. 1. (a) Proposed global phase diagram [8] motivating this work. The horizontal axis represents the competition between the Kondo
coupling, parametrized by the bare Kondo temperature T (0)
K and the RKKY coupling I. The vertical axis plots a quantity G measuring the
degree of quantum ﬂuctuations of the local moments. P and AF label paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases while the indices L and S
denote large and small Fermi surfaces, respectively. The rectangle indicates the region of focus of this study. (b) Phase diagram of the Ising-
anisotropic Kondo lattice as found in this work. It can be regarded as a concrete realization of the rectangular region of (a) with G = ∆/T (0)

where ∆ is a transverse magnetic ﬁeld that tunes the quantum ﬂuctuations of the local moments.

Here, k and Iq are Fourier transforms of the hopping matrix
tij and the RKKY coupling Iij in Eq. (1), while Σσ(ω) and
M (ω) are the single-particle and spin self-energies. The local
susceptibility is given by

where mAF = (cid:104)S(z)(cid:105) is the order parameter.
In our cal-
culations, we take an RKKY density of states ρI (ω) =
(2I)−1Θ(I − |ω|) corresponding to a generic case of two-
dimensional magnetic ﬂuctuations. This implies that the most
negative value of the RKKY coupling is Iq=Q = −I occur-
ring at some ordering wave-vector Q; using Eqs. (3) and (4)
we obtain the self-consistency condition [8]

χloc(ω) =

ln [1 + 2Iχ(Q, ω)] .

(9)

For generic conduction-electron ﬁllings that correspond to
the case of heavy-fermion metals, the EDMFT uses a ﬁxed,
featureless conduction-electron density of states ρ() =
(2D)−1 Θ(D − ||) to avoid double-counting the RKKY in-
teractions [40]. This usage is supported by analytical stud-
ies [37] indicating that corrections to Σσ(ω) generate sub-
leading terms close to the critical point. In the case of local
criticality[6], a singularity in the single-particle spectrum oc-
curs when the local susceptibility is divergent, which marks a
critical destruction of Kondo screening.

Solution of the EDMFT equations requires iterated solution
of the impurity BFKM Hamiltonian (5) until the Weiss ﬁeld
χ−1
0 (ω) converges to within a predeﬁned tolerance. For each
trial form of χ−1
0 (ω), the impurity problem must be solved
using a Bose-Fermi variant of the numerical renormalization
group [2, 5]. In this work each single EDMFT iteration re-
quired several hours of running time. While self-consistent
solutions far from criticality converged within 20 iterations or
fewer, solutions closest to quantum phase transitions typically

c,P and δ(0)

critical couplings δ(0)
c,AF obtained via linear extrapola-
tion of χ−1(Q) from both sides differ by less than 5% of the
mean critical coupling. Similar to previous ∆ = 0 numerical
renormalization-group results [3, 4], including their Landau
analysis [4], and other analytical and numerical studies [6–8],
these thermodynamic properties for ∆ (cid:54)= 0 as well as the dy-
namic scaling behavior (see below) suggest the second-order
nature of the T = 0 transition. These results establish the ex-
istence of PL-AFS transitions in the presence of a transverse
ﬁeld with a phase boundary shown in Fig. 1(b).

To demonstrate that the transitions for nonzero ∆(0) are
most likely of the locally critical type, and to provide further
evidence against ﬁrst-order transitions, we plot in Fig. 3(a)
the inverse local susceptibility versus the inverse of the lat-
tice susceptibility at ω = T = 0 for ∆(0) = 0.21 on the
P side. The calculated values (squares) match the dimen-
sionless function y = 2/ln(1 + 2/x) (line, from Eq. (9));
this indicates that the two susceptibilities diverge simultane-
ously at the critical point, as expected for local criticality with
two-dimensional magnetic ﬂuctations. Similar results were
obtained for ∆(0) = 0, 0.1, and 0.31.

We also analyze the dynamical scaling of the T = 0 local
susceptibility, which on approach to the critical point is ex-
pected to take a form similar to its ∆(0) = 0 counterpart [3, 6]:

c,P (P side) for ∆(0) = 0.21. As δ(1) approaches
its critical value δ(1)
c = 1.507, the curves tend to a logarith-
mic dependence over an intermediate frequency range. This
indicates that the logarithmic form typical of a locally criti-
cal solution for ∆(0) = 0 is also present for ﬁnite transverse
ﬁelds, and we conclude that we are again seeing a locally crit-
ical transition. The value of the extracted exponent [Eq. (10)]
is α = 0.85±0.03. We can understand the difference between
our estimate and the value α = 0.78(4) found for ∆(0) = 0
[3] as a consequence of different Wilson parameters used in
the numerical discretization of the band and bath continua:
Λ = 3 used previously vs Λ = 9 here. Based on a superscal-
ing discussed below [see Fig. 4(a)], we identify the value of α
for nonzero ∆(0) with that for the zero-transverse ﬁeld case.
A linear extrapolation in terms of log(Λ) (Ref. 13 and Sup-
plemental Material [39]) estimates a continuum-limit value
α(Λ → 1) = 0.73 ± 0.01. This compares well with the
exponent α ≈ 0.75 extracted from neutron-scattering mea-
surements in CeCu5.9Au0.1 [5].

Line of critical points and scaling of critical dynamics:
For each value of the transverse ﬁeld ∆, we study the quan-
tum phase transition by tuning the RKKY coupling I with
a ﬁxed Kondo coupling JK, or equivalently, a ﬁxed bare
Kondo scale deﬁned in terms of the local static susceptibil-
ity as T (0)
loc (ω = 0; T = I = ∆ = 0). We express the
transverse ﬁeld and the RKKY coupling in units of T (0)
K , i.e.,
by deﬁning ∆(0) ≡ ∆/T (0)
K . We analyze
the representative cases ∆(0) = 0, 0.1, 0.21, and 0.31. Our
discussion focuses on the two largest values of the transverse
ﬁeld, but very similar results are obtained for ∆(0) = 0.1.
Figure 2 shows the evolution of the thermodynamics in the
limit T → 0 as functions of the normalized RKKY coupling
δ(0) for ∆(0) = 0, 0.21, and 0.31. The local and lattice
susceptibilities diverge as one approaches the critical point
at δ(0) = δ(0)
from either the P or the AF phase. On ap-
proach from the ordered side, the magnetic order-parameter
mAF also appears to vanish continuously. There is a narrow re-
gion of coexistence of ordered and disordered solutions. The

the calculated values while the solid line is is determined by Eq. (9)
with appropriate normalization, as discussed in the main text. The
match between the expected and calculated values indicates that the
two susceptibilities diverge simultaneously at the extrapolated crit-
ical coupling and that the transition is of the second-order, locally
critical type. (b) Semi-log plot of the real part of the local suscep-

δ(1) → δ(1)

c = 1.507.

We next turn to the analysis of the scaling for the lattice
spin susceptibility. A previous study of the standalone BFKM
revealed a critical spectrum that varies continuously with the
applied transverse-ﬁeld, strongly suggesting that a marginal
operator controls the renormalization-group ﬂow along the
critical line [5]. As the self-consistent BFKM solutions form
a subset of possible solutions of the standalone BFKM, a
similar marginal behavior is the most likely scenario in the
EDMFT case. This has motivated us to analyze the relation-
ship of the critical susceptibility for the varying ∆. We ﬁnd
that χloc(ω) along the critical line collapses onto a superscal-
ing form, when χloc and ω are both normalized in terms of
the ﬁeld-dependent bare Kondo scale T (i)
K deﬁned above. The
scaling collapse is demonstrated in Fig. 4(a), where for each
value of ∆(0), δ(i) is chosen closest to its extrapolated crit-
ical value δ(i)
c,P . The small deviations from the scaling form
can be attributed to differences in δ(i) − δ(i)
c between the three
cases. The observed superscaling shows that the critical be-
havior stays the same along the line of transitions, which in
turn is compatible with the proposed marginality.

To further illustrate this point, Fig. 4(b) plots the static
data from Figs. 2(a)–(c) as functions of δ(i) rather than δ(0).
The solid lines represent ﬁts to the zero-transverse-ﬁeld data.
Good data collapse is apparent as the transition is approached

from either side, implying very close values of δ(i)
for the
c
cases i = 0, 1, and 2. Marked deviations are seen only on the
AF side far from the critical points.

We close with several remarks. Firstly, our results provide
a concrete realization of a line of type-I transitions in the pro-
posed global phase diagram in Fig. 1. They also demonstrate
a superscaling of the magnetic response that implies that the
critical exponents are unchanged along this line.
Secondly, the Kondo lattice model [Eq. (1))] in the limit of
JK → 0 exhibits, for sufﬁciently large ∆, a spin-gapped para-
magnetic phase [27]. We therefore expect the emergence of a
PS phase for large ∆ and small JK. However, this regime is
difﬁcult to study, because the ∆-induced transition at T = 0
in the absence of any coupling to fermions is ﬁrst-order in
EDMFT (see the Supplemental Material [39]).
Indeed, for
values of ∆(0) approaching O(1), the second-order transitions
described above become ﬁrst-order. A uniﬁed treatment of
type-I and type-III transitions on the global phase diagram,
corresponding to weaker and stronger transverse ﬁelds respec-
tively, is an important issue deferred to future studies.

Finally, our concrete calculations using a well-deﬁned
model are important for laying a theoretical foundation for the
overall understanding and classiﬁcation of quantum-critical
heavy-fermion metals. By providing evidence for a line of
local critical points on the global phase diagram, our ﬁnd-
ings contribute a robust basis for understanding the unusual
properties characteristic of Kondo-destruction quantum crit-
icality observed in various heavy-fermion compounds. Fur-
thermore, our study suggests a new experiment, namely, to

To summarize, we have identiﬁed a concrete Kondo lattice
model in which the dynamical effects of tunable quantum ﬂuc-
tuations of the local-moment magnetism can be studied on an
equal footing with those associated with the Kondo coupling.
We have demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time in a concrete model,
a line of ﬁxed points describing local quantum critical points,
where the onset of antiferromagnetic order is concurrent with
the destruction of Kondo entanglement. This result provides
a strong basis for the classiﬁcation of quantum phase transi-
tions of antiferromangetic heavy-fermion metals in terms of
the global phase diagram, and motivates a new experiment to
test our predictions.

Quantum criticality and global phase diagram of an Ising-anisotropic Kondo lattice:

Supplemental Material

1

The Supplemental Material is divided into ﬁve parts. We discuss the numerical implementation of the extended dynamical
K ≥ 1)
mean-ﬁeld theory (EDMFT) of the Kondo lattice model with a transverse ﬁeld ∆, the large-transverse-ﬁeld regime (∆/T (0
of our calculations, a previous study of the standalone transverse-ﬁeld Bose-Fermi Kondo Model (BFKM) that suggested the
presence of a line of critical points, the extension of the marginality to the self-consistent case, and the dependence of the critical
exponents on the numerical renormalization-group (NRG) discretization parameter Λ.

I. NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF EDMFT EQUATIONS

For given coupling constants of the BFKM [Eq. (5) in the main text], each iteration of the numerical solution of the EDMFT
self-consistency conditions [Eqs. (8) and (9)] involves two steps. Using the current estimates for the Weiss ﬁeld χ−1
0 (ω) and the
local ﬁeld hloc, we determine χloc(ω) and, for ordered solutions, the order parameter mAF. The second step involves updating the
estimated χ−1
0 (ω) and hloc through application of the self-consistency conditions. The procedure is iterated until the Weiss ﬁeld
satisﬁes a predeﬁned convergence criterion. The ﬁrst step requires solution of the BFKM. In our calculations, this was achieved
using an extension of the numerical renormalization-group (NRG) method [S1] to treat impurities coupled both to a fermionic
band and to a bosonic bath [S2]. The method maps the BFKM to a pair of Wilson chains, one fermionic and the other bosonic,
each coupled at one end to the impurity spin degree of freedom.

Because the NRG calculates the imaginary part of the dynamical spin susceptibility through broadened delta functions, the
ω → 0 value of the real part of the spin susceptibility (calculated via a Hilbert transform) differs from the result that would
arise from a direct linear-response calculation. Although the mismatch can be partially corrected [S3, S4], it still results in a
nominal coexistence region of the phase diagram [see Figs. 2(a)-(c) of the main text]. It is important to note that the extent of
this overlap region for ∆ > 0 (less than 5% of the estimated critical coupling) is on the same scale as found in EDMFT studies
for ∆ = 0 [S3]. In accordance with this previous EDMFT work, we consider that the coexistence observed in the present results
is fully compatible with a second-order transition at T = 0. Moreover, a Landau analysis for the EDMFT equations led to a
continuous transition in the ∆ = 0 case [S4], and this analysis also applies to the nonzero ∆ cases we have presented in the
main text. Consistent with this conclusion, the T = 0 transition of the standalone BFKM in zero transverse ﬁeld was evidenced
to be second order [S2, S5]. Furthermore, the critical behavior of the local quantities of the Kondo lattice model, discussed in
the main text, is also consistent with the ∆ = 0 analytical [S6, S7] and numerical [S3, S4, S8] studies. Altogether, these result
provide evidence for the second-order nature of the quantum phase transitions.

All of the results presented in the main text correspond to self-consistent, zero-temperature solutions of the EDMFT equations,

converged to 0.001% precision in all quantities and for all frequencies such that 10−7 (cid:46) ω/T (0)

K = 0.476D.

II. LARGE TRANSVERSE-FIELD REGIME WITHIN THE EDMFT

In the limit of JK → 0 (T (0)

K → 0), the Kondo lattice model (KLM) [Eq. (1)] reduces to the transverse-ﬁeld Ising model
(TFIM) [S9] which exhibits second-order transitions between Ising long-range ordered and spin-gapped paramagnetic phases.
Inside the latter phase with small but nonzero JK, we expect the emergence of an analogous PS phase [S10]. In practice, this
regime is difﬁcult to study within the EDMFT. To illustrate, we consider the ∆-induced transition at T = 0, which—in the
absence of any coupling to fermions—has a dynamic exponent z = 1. For spatial dimensions d = 2, the dynamics raise the
effective dimensionality to deff = d + z = 3, which is less than the upper critical dimension of 4. As a result, a spatial anomalous
dimension must emerge. In this case, the EDMFT equations are expected to yield a ﬁrst-order phase transition, as demonstrated
by the transition at nonzero temperature TN in the EDMFT treatment of the KLM (where deff = 2, also below the upper critical
dimension) [S8]. For the full KLM (JK, ∆ (cid:54)= 0), we expect this spurious effect to come into play for ∆/TK = O(1). Indeed,
for the case ∆(0) = 0.63 (not shown) we obtain a large coexistence region between completely screened and ﬁnite magnetic
order-parameter solutions with a width approaching 100% of the estimated δc,AF. We stress that, for the range of ∆/T (0)
K values
discussed in the main text, we have provided ample evidence for a line of continuous zero-temperature phase transitions.

III. MARGINAL BEHAVIOR AND LINE OF UNSTABLE FIXED POINTS IN THE BFKM WITHOUT SELF-CONSISTENCY

2

In anticipation of the self-consistent solution for the BFKM with a transverse ﬁeld, an NRG study was previously undertaken
of a standalone (non-self-consistent) BFKM with a sub-Ohmic bosonic spectral function B(ω) [S5]. The results for this inde-
pendent model strongly suggest the existence of a line of critical points generated by the transverse ﬁeld. Equivalently, ∆ can be
considered to be a marginally relevant perturbation about the ∆ = 0 ﬁxed point. Since the self-consistent results must belong to
a subset of the standalone solutions (see discussion on scaling analysis below), our starting hypothesis in the self-consistent case
was that a marginal scaling variable also emerges in the EDMFT approach. The self-consistent results presented in the main text
are in agreement with this scenario.

We give a brief overview of the previously obtained [S5] NRG results for the standalone BFKM coupled to a transverse ﬁeld

with the bosonic spectral function B(ω) chosen to have the power-law form

where g0 is an effective coupling to the bosons, ω0 is a high-energy cutoff scale, and s = 0.8. (Similar results are obtained for
other sub-Ohmic exponents s < 1). In an EDMFT setting, such a spectral function would be characteristic of a self-consistent
Weiss ﬁeld approaching a critical dynamical form. In the standalone model, a line of critical points is found to separate screened
and localized moment phases in the presence of a transverse ﬁeld. Since self-consistency is not imposed, the critical behavior is
much more accessible and solutions with (g − gc) /gc of O(10−6) are readily obtained. In this proximity to the critical manifold,
and in an intermediate scaling regime, the NRG spectrum for Wilson discretization parameter Λ = 9 shows clear invariance over
roughly 7-10 NRG iterations, corresponding to a rescaling by a factor of Λ1/2 per iteration or roughly 4-5 decades overall. Over
this energy window, the NRG spectrum can be presumed to provide an accurate approximation to the spectrum of the critical
ﬁxed point Hamiltonian [S1]. Within the NRG, two ﬁxed points are identical if, for the same value of Λ, they share the same
spectrum as well as equivalent matrix elements of every local operator between many-body eigenstates. Thus, comparison of
NRG spectra provides a powerful means of studying the ﬁxed-point structure of a problem.

In a transverse ﬁeld, the critical spectra discussed above exhibit clear Zeeman-like splitting [S5]. This is clearest for pairs of

states with an odd value of the total conserved charge (measured from half-ﬁlling)

where fnσ annihilates an electron of spin index σ = ± 1
2 at site n of the Wilson chain, and N = 0, 1, 2, . . . is the NRG iteration
number. For these odd-Q pairs, the splittings increase with ∆. The plateaus in the Q = 1 spectrum vs N around N = 24
are illustrated in Fig. S1(a), while the size of the splittings for the two lowest Q = 1 levels are plotted as functions of ∆ in
Fig. S1(b).

The same effect is harder to ascertain for even values of Q. However, there are indications that for Q = 0, the lowest part of
the spectrum is independent of ∆, while higher states, possibly mixing with Q = 0 particle-hole excitations of the fermions, do
vary with transverse ﬁeld. The continuous variation of some of these states with increasing ∆ naturally suggests the presence
of a marginal scaling variable which generates a line of unstable ﬁxed points. The different behaviors of the even-Q and odd-Q
spectra also suggest that the marginal operator is mainly associated with fermionic excitations.

There are indications of the existence of such a marginal operator from analytic weak-coupling Coulomb-gas studies of
similar models [S11, S12] such as the two-state system (spin-boson model) in the presence of Kondo-like exchange couplings.
In particular, Ref. S12 showed that the equivalent of the transverse ﬁeld, together with the spin-dependent longitudinal Kondo
interactions generate a marginal coupling under the renormalization group (RG) that locally hybridizes spin up/down conduction
electrons. This effect introduces spontaneous “spin-ﬂip” for the conduction electrons or equivalently spin-density ﬂuctuations
which reduce the screening (“orthogonality” effect) of the pure Kondo spin-ﬂip scattering. Unfortunately, these studies do not
consider a coupling to a bosonic bath that can lead to corrections to scaling. The possible extension of these works to the full
BFKM remains an important future direction. Here, we note that if such an operator were to remain marginal at the ∆ = 0
critical point, it could pinpoint a way to understand both the standalone and self-consistent BFKM numerical results. Physically,
we expect that marginal couplings between the conduction electrons are likely to cause a gradual decrease in the electrons’
ability to screen the impurity and to introduce additional local critical modes.

The line of unstable ﬁxed points discussed above is illustrated by the red line in the RG ﬂow diagram shown in Fig. S1(c). The
appearance of a continuous line extending from the ∆ = 0 unstable ﬁxed point implies the existence of an operator associated
with the transverse ﬁeld that is marginal (at least over a range of small ∆).

IV. MARGINAL BEHAVIOR IN THE SELF-CONSISTENT SOLUTIONS

In the previous section we discussed the emergence of a line of unstable ﬁxed points for the standalone BFKM with ﬁnite
values of the bare transverse ﬁeld. Here, based on the general correspondence between the standalone and self-consistent
versions of the BFKM, we argue that a similar line of ﬁxed points appears in the solutions of the EDMFT equations, i.e., that a
ﬁnite transverse-ﬁeld introduces an additional marginal operator in the lattice case as well.

As shown in Refs. S6 and S7, for the self-consistent BFKM with ∆ = 0, the leading logarithmic scaling form of the local
critical susceptibility is determined by the self-consistency condition [Eq. (9)]. Up to irrelevant terms, the correspondence
between the leading low-frequency form of the spectral function B(ω) [Eq. (S1)] and the Weiss ﬁeld χ−1
0 (ω) implies that
self-consistent critical solutions form a subset of the standalone model.

On general grounds, we expect that self-consistent critical solutions are also a subset of solutions of standalone models both
for zero and nonzero transverse ﬁelds. The results presented in the main text indicate that for certain critical combinations
of the couplings JK, I, and ∆, the system exhibits the dynamical logarithmic form of the zero transverse-ﬁeld solution. Two
possibilities then arise: either the set of self-consistent critical solutions is mapped onto a single effective ∆ = 0 unstable ﬁxed
point or, for each value of the transverse-ﬁeld, the RG ﬂows are determined by different ﬁxed points. In either case, the leading
critical scaling must be compatible with that of the ∆ = 0 solution, with an expected renormalization of nonuniversal scales.
Equivalently, ∆ is either irrelevant about the zero-transverse ﬁeld unstable ﬁxed point or it introduces a marginal scaling variable.
In view of the results of the standalone BFKM with ∆ > 0, we believe that the latter scenario is more likely. The superscaling
shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) is consistent with the presence of a marginal operator.

In practice, the distinction between irrelevant and marginal cases is difﬁcult to establish unambiguously due to the heavy
computational demands in the vicinity of the critical point. The difference between the two possibilities is important from a
physical point of view. In the irrelevant case, the ﬂuctuations of the local moments, parameterized by ∆, cannot tune a relevant
scaling variable that allows any transverse ﬁeld (however large) to modify the critical low-energy theory. In the marginal case,
as discussed in the previous section, in the progressive splitting of the spectrum with increasing |∆| suggests a gradual disentan-
glement of the critical modes associated with Kondo destruction, and an evolution to a ﬁxed point increasingly dominated by the
ﬂuctuations of the local moment. A priori, this makes possible the AFS ↔ PS, PL ↔ PS transitions that are expected for large
transverse ﬁelds.

For completeness, we also discuss the possibility that ∆ introduces an additional relevant operator. Close to the self-consistent
∆ = 0 ﬁxed point, the modiﬁed RG ﬂows become unstable in a new direction, eventually heading to a different ﬁxed point. If
this point is stable, the second-order transition must become a cross-over. Alternately, a second unstable ﬁxed point would most
likely generate a new dynamical critical form. The fact that the local susceptibility appears to maintain its ∆ = 0 logarithmic
form, the static superscaling shown in Fig. 4(b), and the natural expectation of marginal behavior discussed above, all make this
scenario unlikely.

V. DEPENDENCE OF CRITICAL EXPONENT α ON NRG DISCRETIZATION PARAMETER Λ

Both in its original form [S1] and its Bose-Fermi (two-chain) extension [S2], the NRG involves a discretization parameter
Λ > 1. Its essential role is to provide an artiﬁcial separation of energy scales along the Wilson chain representation of the
conduction band and of the bosonic bath. The values of certain properties calculated using the NRG results depend on Λ, and
the physical values must be obtained via extrapolation to the continuum limit Λ → 1. The exponent α entering Eq. (10) is one
such property. An NRG treatment of a pure-bosonic mapping of the self-consistent BFKM in zero transverse ﬁeld discovered a
logarithmic dependence of α on Λ [S13]. The good ﬁt in that case (based on multiple Λ values spanning half a decade) motivated
the analogous procedure used in the present work, where the extrapolation to Λ = 1 was based solely on data points for Λ = 3
and Λ = 9.
