Accurate measurement of thermoelectric generator (TEG) eﬃciency is important but till now, it remains as
a challenge. In this paper, we addressed the problem of accurate measurement of TEG eﬃciency along with
its methods of enhancement. This is done by utilizing the material which can operate on higher temperature
range and having higher ﬁgure of merit (Z ¯T ). An increment in the eﬃciency of TEG is observed by using the
hybrid technology - diﬀerent thermoelectric materials are kept in series connection. The parallel connection
of TEG leads to increase in the power output but the operating temperature range will get restricted. So, by
exploiting the series and parallel combination, we may achieve the high value of output power and eﬃciency.
The expression of ηmax is widely used in literature which directly depends on Z ¯T . Since, Z ¯T value depends
on temperature, so the expression for ηmax is not applicable for wide temperature range. Selection of diﬀerent
materials having good performance in their temperature domains is done. The electrical energy obtained
through this TEG will fulﬁll the auxiliary need of an automobile. To this end, we propose the expression of
overall eﬃciency of TEG by taking small segmented temperature range for making temperature dependent
parameter to be constant. The proposed method will acts as a bridge between theoretical calculations done
by scientiﬁc community with real life applications.

INTRODUCTION

For fulﬁlling the increasing demand of electricity, we
can not rely only on limited resource of non-renewable
source of energy. To reduce our dependencies over non-
renewable source of energy, there is heedful need to ﬁnd
some other sources of energy. By seeing the multifold ad-
vantages of TEG, such as maintenance free, environment
friendly, decrease pollutant emission and alternative fuel
for space craft, TEG can be treated as a better alter-
native. TEG can produce some useful electrical energy
from the waste heat source. Where, heat source can be
thermal power plant1 ( the main source of power produc-
tion in the world), automobile etc. The main fuel for au-
tomobile’s are petrol and diesel. Consequently, scarcity
of these fuels cause the fuel crisis in the world2. Af-
ter considering all aspect such as, automobile eﬃciency
around 35% and friction loss around 10% then also ap-
proximately 40% of energy is being wasted out from an
automobile engine3. So, if enable ourselves to extract a
small amount of this waste energy, the auxiliary need of
automobile can be fulﬁlled. Hence, this can be possible
with sustainable development of TEG.

In spite of above-mentioned qualities, we have certain
challenges: ﬁrstly, to calculate the exact eﬃciency and

secondly, how to increase the eﬃciency of TEG. Despite
great research and development in the ﬁeld of TEG, the
eﬃciency is still low. The eﬃciency of TEG4 is expressed
as

ﬂow in a closed circuit across thermoelement when the
two ends are at diﬀerent temperature. Mainly, we deal
with three fundamental thermoelectric eﬀects5, namely,

1

Seebeck eﬀect, Peltier eﬀect and Thomson eﬀect. These
eﬀects which underlies the conversion of heat energy into
electrical energy and vice-versa56. Generally, we envisage
an open circuit for Seebeck eﬀect. Open circuit potential
diﬀerence developed can be written as7

V = S∆T

(2)

where S is Seebeck coeﬃcient of thermoelement.

Since, our concern is to calculate eﬃciency, which is
mainly governed by ﬁgure of merit i.e Z ¯T , where Z ¯T is
deﬁned as6-

Z ¯T =

S2σ
λ

¯T

(3)

Where, S, σ, λ and ¯T are Seebeck coeﬃcient, electrical
conductivity, thermal conductivity and average temper-
ature, respectively. These parameters as S, σ and λ are
temperature dependent89. So, to avoid this temperature
dependency, a lot of research is gone through where re-
search groups already calculated Z ¯T value. This sim-
pliﬁes the problem because now we have only one tem-
perature dependent parameter i.e Z ¯T . After considering
assumptions like S, σ, λ are temperature independent and
considering Seebeck eﬀect, Peltier eﬀect and Thomson ef-
fect, we have the maximum eﬃciency formula for a TEG
using thermoelectric materials as68-

ηmax =

Th − Tc

Th

1 + z ¯T − 1

Where, ¯T = Th+Tc
, Th, Tc and Z ¯T denote average,
source, sink temperature and ﬁgure of merit, respectively.
In equation (4) ηmax clearly gives us criterion for select-
ing a material for fabricating TEG, which suggests that
higher the value of Z ¯T , higher will be the ηmax for a
ﬁxed value of Th and Tc. So, to get higher value of Z ¯T
in higher working temperature range, materials plays an
important role.

As mentioned above, we have only one temperature
dependent parameter i.e Z ¯T . So, to overcome this tem-
perature dependence aspect we tried by adopting seg-
mentation method, in which dividing the working tem-
perature range into very small-small segment, to make it
temperature independent identities10. We did formula-
tion by segmentation of sample and successfully reached
to reasonable results10. As our aim is to improve the
eﬃciency but since a single material can’t have a good
ﬁgure of merit in the entire range of temperature. So, to
enhance the eﬃciency of TEG we have to choose diﬀer-
ent materials for diﬀerent operating conditions. We can
11 and P bT e12 having good ﬁgure
clearly see that Be2T e3
of merit in diﬀerent temperature range13. So, we will use
hybridization of Be2T e3 and P bT e. Where P bT e and
Be2T e3 is showing good compatibility13 as well as good
ﬁgure of merit in higher and lower temperature range, re-
spectively. First calculate the eﬃciency by using P bT e as
thermoelectric element for Th and Ti temperature range

and secondly for Ti and Tc. Where Th, Tc and Ti are tem-
peratures of diﬀerent points as shown in FIG.2. Finally,
after hybridization technique14, we will ﬁnd cumulative
eﬃciency. Keeping application point of view in mind,
we can think about automobile sector15 where, usually,
higher temperature remains as ﬁxed. For that we cal-
culated temperature dependent eﬃciency of Bi2T e3 and
P bT e as a hybrid module.

II. METHODOLOGY

For calculating eﬃciency of hybrid TEG, ﬁrstly, we
would like to calculate the eﬃciency for P bT e element.
At ﬁrst, imaginarily segment P bT e element into a num-
ber of small pieces such as segment 1,2,3...so-on as shown
in the FIG.2. Where segmentation of sample is done in

FIG. 2. Schematic of segmentation of hybrid TEG comprising
of Bi2T e3 and P bT e

(4)

order to avoid temperature dependent parameter. The
temperature diﬀerence between two ends of the segment
will be decided by the number of the segment that we
want to do. Now considering top most layer i.e layer 1
where, temperature of hot and cold ends are Th and T1,
respectively. Hence, temperature diﬀerence will become
∆T = Th − T1. Taking Z ¯T of P bT e at Tavg = Th+Tc
and
putting in equation (4), it becomes as

. After putting all the three variable i.e ∆T, ¯T andZ ¯T
we have η1. Since, we have ”n” number of segments,
consequently, we will have η1, η2, η3 ...so-on to ηn. Now,
by applying simple thermodynamics formulation for the
cascaded system141617 as:-
ηoverall1 = 1 − (1 − η1)(1 − η2)(1 − η3)......(1 − ηn) (6)

. We will get cumulative eﬃciency of P bT e i.e ηoverall1
for a temperature diﬀerence of Th − Ti. Similarly pro-
ceeding for lower segment i.e Bi2T e3 in their favorable
temperature range i.e TitoTc. Consequently we will have
η1a, η2a, η3a...so-on to ηna and putting in above equation
(6), will give ηoverall2. So, now we have overall eﬃciency
for both segments of hybrid module. Considering a nec-
essary assumption of neglecting interface resistance, we

will have overall eﬃciency of TEG module, i.e

ηoverall = 1 − (1 − ηoverall1)(1 − ηoverall2)

(7)

. This procedure is quite easy for calculating TEG eﬃ-
ciency because only by knowing Z ¯T , Th and Tc we can
ﬁnd the eﬃciency of speciﬁc TEG module.

III. RESULT AND DISCUSSION

As per our previous results obtained for diﬀerent ma-
terials such as Bi2T e3, T AGS, SiGe having around 7%
conversion eﬃciency10. Validation of above-mentioned
procedure is done by some experimentally obtained re-
sults in our previous work18. The calculation for Bi2T e3
and P bT e module has been done for temperature range
of 310 K-510 K and 510 K-900 K, respectively.

The organization of calculations are as follows: ﬁrst-
segment of Bi2T e3 has been considered (i.e 310 K-510
K), second- segment of P bT e has been considered (i.e
510-900 K). For diﬀerent segment, the ∆T = 10 K is
taken in the calculation and the temperature dependent
value of Z ¯T is considered from previous reports13. Keep-
ing in mind about ∆T = 10 K segmentation of en-
tire temperature range is done. Starting from average
temperature of ﬁrst segment i.e ¯T = 310 K and tak-
ing Z ¯T = 0.7479 at that temperature. Using Equation
(5), the eﬃciency of ﬁrst segment has been observed as
η1 = 0.00447%. Similarly the eﬃciency of the consec-
utive segments are η2 = 0.00443%......η22 = 0.001433%.
All the calculated eﬃciencies obtained from equation (5)
are used in equation (6) in order to get overall eﬃciency
i.e ηoverall1 = 6.56%. Similarly proceeding for P bT e seg-
ment, we got η23 = 0.001475%, η24 = 0.00152% and so
on to η60 = 0.001294%. Using equation (6) for P bT e
material from segment 23 to 60 we got ηoverall2 = 6.18%.
By neglecting interface resistance loss, using ηoverall1 =
6.56% and ηoverall2 = 6.18% in equation (6) we got
ηoverall = 12.33%. Here we are presenting the individ-
ual eﬃciency of Bi2T e3 and P bT e in tabulation form.
By plotting above-obtained results in graphical form.
.
We have calculated the eﬃciency of Bi2T e3 and P bT e
in their entire working temperature range. As we can
see that eﬃciency of Bi2T e3 showing a decreasing slope
after some temperature as well as P bT e is having very
low eﬃciency in the lower temperature range. So, for
hybrid module, we have taken P bT e for a temperature
range of 510 K to 900 K and Bi2T e3 in 310 K to 510
K to maximize eﬃciency. Since, FIG.3 clearly suggests

FIG. 3. Eﬃciency v/s increasing hot end temperature, keep-
ing lower temperature ﬁxed

that individually both materials are having limited eﬃ-
ciency as well as limited working temperature range, but
as hybrid module is taken into account the eﬃciency got
increased.

It is clear from the above discussion that by using the
temperature dependent data of Z ¯T one can calculate the
eﬃciency of a TEG operates in a particular tempera-
ture range. This method can also be use to calculate
the temperature dependent eﬃciency of TEG when the
temperature of one end is ﬁxed and that of another end
is varying. Considering automobile as application site
where TEG module can be installed in which generally
exhaust temperature of the engine can be treated as con-
stant. So, keeping higher temperature ﬁxed at 900 K and
varying lower temperature till 510 K for P bT e and from
510 K to 310 K for Bi2T e3, we got overall eﬃciency for
the hybrid module by same methodology. The eﬃciency
when higher temperature is Th is ﬁxed and Tc is varying,
can be written as

ηT = 1 − (1 − η1)(1 − η2)(1 − η3)......(1 − ηj)

(8)
Where T = Th−∆T ∗j and ∆T is the temperature diﬀer-
ence across each segment. Temperature dependent eﬃ-
ciency obtained through this formula is plotted in FIG.4.
Since our data obtained for single module shows good
agreement with Salzgeber et.al18. Hence, formulation for
hybrid module is equally valid. Such graph is expected
to be very useful in deciding the economical operating
temperature range for TEG.

The fairly good agreement between our calculated re-
sults with the experimental results obtained from TEG
suggests the utility of our methods in predicting and en-
hancing the eﬃciency of TEG under various condition
by using temperature dependent material properties like
S, σ, λ on which ﬁgure of merit Z ¯T depends through
equation (3). So, this method provides a cheap and ef-
ﬁcient way for evaluating the eﬃciency of a TEG made

IV. CONCLUSION

As per best of our knowledge, we came to a point that
people usually use to take a ﬁxed value of Z ¯T for en-
tire working temperature range. Z ¯T value not usually
remains to be constant for entire working temperature
range. This method gives approximately close to exact
value. Validation of above approach is done previously10,
which shows resemblance with exact value. All formula-
tion is done by considering the one-dimensional ﬂow of
heat model for calculating eﬃciency. Here, we took hy-
brid system consisting of Bi2T e3 and P bT e. Individu-
ally calculation of eﬃciency is done for both thermoele-
ments in their entire working temperature range. Their
individual eﬃciency lies around 7% to 8%, but after hy-
bridizing both and distributing temperature as per their
better ﬁgure of merit favorable working temperature the
cumulative eﬃciency shoot up to around 12.30%, which
is signiﬁcantly good eﬃciency. This approach help us to
minimize time consumption in a trial method for calcu-
lating eﬃciency by the experimental procedure for diﬀer-
ent materials. We have a method to judge about mate-
rial selection for better TEG module. It also helps to do
the straightforward computation of TEG eﬃciency for an
automotive design engineer to fabricate TEG. The basic
understanding of eﬃciency calculation will give us some
clue for material selection in designing of TEG, conse-
quently, our time and money get saved.

up of particular materials. Finally, it will help in se-
lecting a proper thermoelectric material for a particular
application. In the automobile sector enormous amount
of energy is being wasted out through exhaust port19.
Considering automobile case where upper temperature
is governed by the type of engine installed in that ve-
hicle (keeping other parameters such as engine power,
velocity, road condition, etc. constant). Since, exhaust
port temperature will vary from low, medium, high for
LMV (light motor vehicle), LTV (light transport vehi-
cle), HMV (heavy motor vehicle), respectively. So, for
higher exhaust port temperature we can install hybrid
TEG module which can sustain at higher temperature
as well as having better eﬃciency. Thus, here we have
estimated the temperature dependent eﬃciency of TEG
with the hot end is kept at ﬁxed temperature by varying
cold end temperature, which is presented in FIG.4. It is
clearly mentioned that in X-axis, we have taken temper-
ature diﬀerence between two ends of TEG. For calculat-
ing the absolute temperature of the cold end, we have
to subtract the temperature diﬀerence from the temper-
ature of hot end. Through this calculation, we can tell
about eﬃciency, only by knowing temperature diﬀerence
using graph obtained in FIG.4. Consequently, there will
be diﬀerent temperature diﬀerences between two ends of
TEG for diﬀerent lengths. These types of curve are very
useful for design engineers as it directly provides informa-
tion about eﬃciency by knowing temperature diﬀerence
between hot and cold end. Simultaneously to judge the
best possible temperature range for maximizing eﬃciency
of a TEG at various operating temperature range.
