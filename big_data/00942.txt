Spin current injection and spin accumulation near a ferromagnetic insulator (FI)/nonmagnetic
metal (NM) bilayer ﬁlm under a thermal gradient is investigated theoretically. Using the Fermi
golden rule and the Boltzmann equations, we ﬁnd that FI and NM can exchange spins via interfacial
electron-magnon scattering because of the imbalance between magnon emission and absorption
caused by either non-equilibrium distribution of magnons or non-equilibrium between magnons and
electrons. A temperature gradient in FI and/or a temperature diﬀerence across the FI/NM interface
generates a spin current which carries angular momenta parallel to the magnetization of FI from the
hotter side to the colder one. Interestingly, the spin current induced by a temperature gradient in
NM is negligibly small due to the nonmagnetic nature of the non-equilibrium electron distributions.
The results agree well with all existing experiments.

I.

INTRODUCTION

One of the important topics in spintronics is the spin
current generation and detection [1]. Compare with the
electron spin current, the magnon spin current has the
advantage of lower energy consumption and longer coher-
ence time, especially in ferromagnetic insulators (FI) [2].
Furthermore, magnons can be used to manipulate the
motion of magnetic domain walls [3, 4]. Recently, inter-
conversion between electron spin current and magnon
spin current and various methods for magnon spin cur-
rent generation in FI were proposed, such as ferromag-
netic resonance (FMR) for coherent magnon spin current
generation (known as spin pumping) [2, 5–7] and temper-
ature gradient for incoherent magnon spin current gener-
ation (known as spin Seebeck eﬀect) [7–12]. The magnon
spin current can be detected by a nonmagnetic metal
(NM) such as Pt or Pd with strong spin-orbit couplings
by which a spin current can be converted into an elec-
tric current via inverse spin Hall eﬀect (ISHE) [13, 14].
Since spin carriers in FI and NM are diﬀerent (magnons
in FI and electrons in NM), the spin transport and spin
current conversion between electrons and magnons across
the FI/NM interface becomes an interesting and impor-
tant issue for both the experiment interpretation and po-
tential applications.

Diﬀerent approaches have been used to investigate the
spin transport in FI/NM bilayer. The stochastic LLG
equation coupled with “spin mixing conductance” con-
cept [7, 15] describes successfully how a spin current is
pumped from FI into NM at FMR or under a temper-
ature gradient [16, 17]. However, the microscopic pic-
ture of the spin pumping and spin mixing conductance
was not given. A quantum mechanical model based on

interfacial s − d coupling between conducting electrons
in NM and local magnetic moments in FI was also pro-
posed [18–21] for spin Seebeck eﬀect (SSE). This model
was originally designed for the transverse SSE [9, 11, 18].
In order to explain why spin current in NM changes di-
rection in the higher and the lower temperature sides
of a sample, coupling of phonons with spins and elec-
trons is necessary [18] if other eﬀect like the anomalous
Nernst eﬀect [22] was not considered. It is believed that
a temperature gradient perpendicularly applied to the
interface (known as longitudinal SSE [11, 12]) is a clean
conﬁguration [22] for SSE. In this paper, we investigate
the spin transport across FI/NM interface due to inter-
facial electron-magnon interaction under a perpendicu-
lar temperature gradient. Phonons do not dominate spin
transport in this case, and are neglected. We show that
there is neither spin accumulation nor spin current at
thermal equilibrium, in consistent with the laws of ther-
modynamics. Once there is a temperature gradient in
the sample or a temperature diﬀerence at the interface,
spin accumulation occurs and a spin current ﬂows across
the interface. Spins parallel to the magnetization of FI
ﬂow from the hotter side to the colder one under a tem-
perature gradient in FI or under a temperature diﬀerence
across the interface. Surprisingly, a temperature gradient
in NM cannot eﬃciently generate a spin current because
the spin currents from non-equilibrium spin-up electrons
and spin-down electrons cancel each other, resulting in
a negligible contribution. Our results are in good agree-
ment with the present experiments.

II. MODEL AND INTERFACIAL

ELECTRON-MAGNON SCATTERING

Following the longitudinal SSE experiments [11], we
consider a FI/NM bilayer model as shown in Fig. 1(a).
An NM layer is in contact with a FI layer, and two ther-
mal reservoirs of temperatures TL and TR are attached to

the left side of NM and and the right side of FI. The vol-
ume, thickness and lattice constant of FI and NM layers
are denoted by Vi, di and bi (i=FI, NM). The interface
is in the yz-plane and its area is A. Although most in-
sulators used in SSE experiments are ferrimagnetic, the
energy of inter-sublattice excitations is too high to be
excited at low temperature [18, 23]. Only the acoustic
spin waves are relevant so that FIs are considered. A FI
can be modeled by the Heisenberg model of spin S on
cubic lattice. The electrons in NM are modeled as a free-
electron gas. Without losing generality, magnetization of
FI is in the −z-direction so that atomic spins S are in
the +z-direction due to the negative gyromagnetic ratio.
The z-component of spins carried by spin-up (spin-down)
electrons and magnons are 

in our model. The current density of spins along −z-
direction in NM is js = (cid:0) 

is the electric current density carried by spin-up (spin-
down) electrons and e > 0 is the absolute value of the
electron charge.

where s is itinerant electron spin in NM and Sn is local
atomic spin at site n of position Rn on the interface. s

strength and the summation is over the atom sites on the
interface. To calculate interfacial electron-magnon scat-
tering rate, we use the lowest-order Holstein-Primakoﬀ
transformation [26] Sn− = √2Sa†
n and Sn+ = √2San
(Sn+ and Sn− are ladder operators of Sn at site n and
a†
n, an are the corresponding creation and annihilation
operators of magnons) so that magnon-magnon interac-
tions are neglected. The scattering due to the non-spin-
ﬂipping part of H do not contribute to spin current and
spin accumulation, and is neglected. In the momentum
space, H involving spin-ﬂipping can be written as,

and becoming an outgoing spin-up (spin-down) electron
of wavevector k (k′), as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). This
Hamiltonian preserves angular momentum, and the mo-
mentum parallel to the interface is conserved.

Similar to the usual phonon-electron scattering calcu-
lation [27] by the Fermi golden rule, the magnon emission

where n(q) is the number of magnons of wavevector q, Ek

lar wavevector components should satisfy k′

qx > 0 for magnon emission and kx > 0, k′

for absorption. For simplicity, a quadratic dispersion is
assumed for electrons in NM, Ek = 2|k|2

spectrum is εq = J|q|2 + D where J is the ferromag-
netic exchange coupling and D is the gap due to magnetic
anisotropy.

III. SPIN TRANSPORT AT THERMAL

EQUILIBRIUM

1

First we consider the case of the bilayer at thermal
equilibrium (TL = TR = T ). The magnon number follows
the Bose-Einstein distribution n(q) = n0(q) =
eβεq −1
and the electron distribution function is the Fermi-Dirac
function fs(k) = f0(k) =
, where s =↑, ↓,
β = (kBT )−1 and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Be-
cause electrons are unpolarized in NM, the chemical po-
tentials of spin-up and spin-down electrons must be the
same, µ↑ = µ↓ = µ0, at the instant when FI and NM
are brought to contact. Due to the energy conservation
Ek + εq = Ek′, we have

eβ(Ek −µs )+1

1

3

Eq. (6) is the detailed balance between magnon absorp-
tion and magnon emission at the thermal equilibrium.
Using this detailed balance result, Eq. (5) gives a vanish-
ing spin current, jFI→NM = 0, and no spin accumulation
in this case. In fact, no spin current and no spin accumu-
lation at the thermal equilibrium hold in general. Oth-
erwise, a spin current would convert into charge current
via the ISHE eﬀect. Thus, this device would generate
electricity at the thermal equilibrium! Since no exter-
nal energy source exists in the set-up, this assumption
leads to a continuous extraction of electric energy from
a sole heat bath, a clear violation of the second law of
thermodynamics. Thus, our result must be model inde-
pendent and true in general. Also, if one regards spin
accumulation as a proximity eﬀect of a NM in contact
with a FI, this result says that the proximity eﬀect does
not exist at the thermal equilibrium, very diﬀerent from
other types of proximity eﬀects such as a semiconductor
carbon nanotube in contact with a metallic carbon nan-
otube [28]. There, the semiconductor carbon nanotube
becomes a weak metal at the thermal equilibrium.

IV. SPIN TRANSPORT AT

NON-EQUILIBRIUM

When diﬀerent temperatures TL, TR are applied on
the two sides of the FI/NM bilayer as shown in Fig.
1(a), the system is at a non-equilibrium state and ther-
mal gradients will eventually established in both FI and
NM. Also, a temperature diﬀerence across the FI/NM
interface may exist when the thermal contact resistance
is non-zero. The temperature proﬁle can in principle
be obtained by solving the corresponding heat diﬀusion
equations with proper boundary conditions if the thermal
conductivities and other material parameters are known.
Since the temperature proﬁle is not the subject of this
work, we shall simply assume constant thermal conduc-
tivities κi of the materials (i = FI, NM), and a con-
stant thermal contact resistance R [11, 29, 30]. Thus,
as shown in Fig. 1(b), a uniform temperature gradient
of αNM = (T1 − TL)/dNM in NM, a uniform temperature
gradient of αFI = (TR − T2)/dFI in FI, and an interfacial
temperature diﬀerence ∆T ≡ T2− T1 across the interface
are established at the steady state. αNM, αFI and ∆T
satisfy

αNMdNM + ∆T + αFIdFI = TR − TL,
αNMκNM =

αNM will induce a non-equilibrium distribution of elec-
trons, while αFI will induce a non-equilibrium distribu-
tion of magnons. ∆T will break the detailed balance
between the magnon absorption and emission as shown
in section III. Since the magnon emission and absorp-
tion are no longer balanced, a net spin current across the
interface shall appear.

On the other hand, due to the spin conserved s − d
interaction at the interface, each absorbed magnon re-
sults in an electron to ﬂip from spin-up to spin-down
state, and each emitted magnon causes an electron to
ﬂip from spin-down to spin-up state. Thus, if there are
more absorbed magnons than emitted ones (jFI→NM > 0
according to Eq. (3)), the number of spin-down electrons
would be larger than that of spin-up electrons, and chem-
ical potential of spin-up and spin-down electrons would
no longer be the same and µ↓ > µ↑. Similarly, when
jFI→NM < 0, we have µ↑ > µ↓. The electron spin ac-
cumulation near the interface causes a spin current js in
NM due to spin diﬀusion. This spin current should be
continuum at the interface. Thus we have

− jFI→NM = js(0) = (cid:18) 

2e(cid:19) j↑(0) +(cid:18)−



2e(cid:19) j↓(0).

(7)

Both j↑(↓) and jFI→NM can be determined by the distri-
bution functions of electrons and magnons, which will be
studied by solving the Boltzmann equations in the next
subsection.

A. Distribution functions under given temperature

proﬁle

When the system is not far from the equilibrium,
n(q) and fs(k) (s =↑,↓) are govern by the Boltzmann
equations with the relaxation time approximation. For
magnons, the distribution function n(q) under the ther-
mal gradient αFI can be obtained by solving following
Boltzmann equation

v(q) · ∇n(q) = −

n1(q)

τ

,

(8)

where v(q) = 1
∇qεq is the group velocity of magnons
with wavevector q, τ is the average relaxation time of
magnons, and n1(q) = n(q) − n0(q) where n0(q) =
is the Bose-Einstein distribution with the local
eβεq −1
temperature. To the ﬁrst order in αFI, we can replace
n(q) by n0(q) in Eq. (8), and obtain

n(q) = n0(q) − τ vx(q)αFI

T n0(n0 + 1). Obviously, we have

∂T = βεq
where ∂n0
n1(−q) = −n1(q).
For electrons, the non-equilibrium distribution is not
only aﬀected by the temperature gradient αNM, but also
by the spin accumulation near the interface, as shown in
Fig. 1(d). To take this spin accumulation into consid-
eration, we need to solve the Boltzmann equation about
fs(k, r) including the spin-ﬂip process [20, 33, 34]:

m , f0,s = [eβ(E−µs) + 1]−1 is the equilibrium
where v = k
distribution function with local temperature and local
electrochemical potential µs(x) for spin s. The relaxation
times τc and τsf describe respectively the momentum-
energy relaxation and spin relaxation of electrons. E =
−∇φ is the electric ﬁeld in NM, and E = 2k2
2m − eφ is
the electron energy. To solve Eq. (10) in linear response
regime (f1,s linear in the temperature gradient and elec-
tric ﬁeld), we can replace fs by f0,s in the left-hand side
of Eq. (10). Thus, we obtain

Normally, the deviation of the local electrochemical po-
tential δµs = µs − µe from the electrochemical po-
tential without spin accumulation (µe) is small. Since
the change of the density of state near the Fermi sur-
face is small, it is common to use the approximation of
δµ↑ = −δµ↓ [20, 31, 32]. After expanding µs and f0,s at
µe and keeping the linear terms in Eq. (11), we have

This is the conventional Seebeck eﬀect [35].

To fully determine fs(k), one still needs to ﬁnd out
δµ↑(0) in terms of known model parameters. The right
hand side of Eq. (7) is linear in δµ↑(0) after using ex-
pression found early for js and dδµ↑
. jFI→NM in
Eq. (7) can also be expressed by n(q) and fs(k) as given
by Eq. (5). Thus Eq. (7) would be an equation about
δµ↑(0). Then we can obtain the spin accumulation and
spin current across the interface as shown below.

dx = δµ↑

B. Spin current in linear response regime

In the last subsection, we obtained fs(k) = f0(k) +
f1,s(k) and n(q) = n0(q) + n1(q), where f1,s and n1,
linear in thermal gradient, is much smaller than their
equilibrium values. Substitute them into Eq.
(5) and
keep only the terms up to linear orders in f1,s and n1,
the spin current can be decomposed into three terms:

jFI→NM = jd + jm + je,

(17)

where

jd = CZall{f0(k)[1 − f0(k′)]n0(q)

− f0(k′)[1 − f0(k)][n0(q) + 1]},

(18)

jm = CZall{f0(k)[1 − f0(k′)]n1(q)

− f0(k′)[1 − f0(k)]n1(−q)},

(19)

je = CZall{f1,↑(k)[1−f0(k′)]−f0(k)f1,↓(k′)}n0(q)−{
f1,↓(−k′)[1 − f0(k)] − f0(k′)f1,↑(−k)}[n0(q) + 1],
where f0 =

,
kBT1
. T1 and T2 are the temperatures of NM and

eβ2 ε−1 with β1 = 1

(20)

kBT2

1

Since Eq. (6) is no longer valid if β1 6= β2, jd is not
zero in this case. jm is mainly due to the deviation of
magnons from their equilibrium distribution. If there is
no temperature gradient αFI, Eq. (9) says n1 = 0, and

5

then jm vanishes. je comes from the deviation of elec-
trons from their equilibrium distribution. According to
Eq. (12), the deviation is caused by both temperature
gradient αNM as well as the spin accumulation δµ ↑ orig-
inated from the spin injection across the interface. Even
if αNM = 0, f1,s still exists as long as there is a nonzero
spin current, for example from ∆T = T2 − T1 6= 0 or
αFI 6= 0. Below, we will study jd, jm, je separately, and
by applying the boundary condition given in Eq.
(7),
and ﬁnd out the relationship between spin current across
the interface, spin accumulation at steady state and ∆T ,
αFI, αNM. To simplify the presentation, we introduce
two notations

L1 = f0(k)[1 − f0(k′)]n0(q),
L2 = f0(k′)[1 − f0(k)][n0(q) + 1].

(21)

Then, jd = CRall(L1−L2), where L1/L2 = e(β1−β2)εq .

When T2 > T1, the magnons have higher tempera-
ture, we have β1 > β2, L1 > L2, and jd > 0. The
spin current induced by the temperature diﬀerence ﬂows
from FI to NM. The spin current reverses its direction
when T1 > T2.
In general, temperature diﬀerence at
the interface generates a spin ﬂow from the hotter side
to the colder side. When ∆T ≪ T1, T2, we can ex-
pand L1/L2 ≈ 1 + (β1 − β2)εq = 1 + ∆T
, then
jd = K1∆T is proportional to ∆T , and coeﬃcient K1 is

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To have a better idea about the magnitude of the spin
current and spin accumulation generated by a thermal
gradient, we numerically compute the total spin cur-
rent jFI→NM given by Eq.
(32) with realistic model
parameters of YIG: S = 23.6, J = 1.9 × 10−40 J·m2,
D = 1.8 × 10−24 J, τ = 10−7 s [20, 36], bFI = 1.2 nm;
and Pt: σ = 9.4 × 106 m−1Ω−1, lsd = 1.5 nm, µ0 = 9.74
eV. Jsd = 1 meV, dFI = 1 mm, and dNM = 15 nm [11]
are used. The temperature diﬀerence between two ther-
mal reservoirs is set to TR − TL = 10 K. In order to
know which thermal source is more eﬀective in spin cur-
rent generation, we ﬁrst examine the cases when all 10

sign. The eﬀective electric ﬁeld along the +y-direction at
the interface can be estimated by [31]

js(x)θSHdx = σEavg,

(34)

where θSH is the spin Hall angle [38] and V = EavgwNM,
here wNM is the width of the NM layer. Thus, the voltage
is given by

For wNM = 6 mm (the same as in the experiment [11])
and for YIG and Pt parameters, the ISHE voltage is es-
timated to be 60 µV that is larger than the experiment
value of 6 µV. The agreement is not too bad since a real
system is much more complicated than the ideal model
conserded here. In reality, the thermal parameters and
relaxation times depend on temperature and the struc-
ture of a sample. If these complications can be included,
our theory may give a more accurate estimate of the ISHE
voltage for a sample. In our analysis, we assume the sim-
plest parabolic energy spectrum and constant relaxation
times for magnons and electrons. Though the physics
shall not change, the value of all quantities should be
sensitive to all these parameters. The interface electron-
magnon scattering should be important for other phe-
nomena in FI/NM structures such as spin pumping [2, 5–
7], transverse SSE [8, 9], spin transfer torque on FI [39]
and spin Hall magnetoresistance [40]. It may also be rel-
evant to the concept of “spin mixing conductance”.

VI. CONCLUSION

It is shown that no spin injection and no spin accumu-
lation are possible at the thermal equilibrium. This con-
clusion is general and model-independent as demanded
by the thermodynamical laws. Spin current and spin ac-
cumulation can be generated through electron-magnon
scatterings by two thermal sources: temperature gradi-
ents in FI layers and a temperature diﬀerence at NM/FI
interface. Both spin current and spin accumulation are
sensitive to material properties. The spin accumulation
increases and the spin current decreases as the spin dif-
fusion length of NM increases. The spin current arises
from imbalance of magnon absorption and emission orig-
inated from diﬀerent magnon and electron temperatures
or the deviations of magnons from their equilibrium dis-
tributions. Spin current ﬂows from the hotter side to the
colder one under a temperature gradient in FI or under
an interfacial temperature diﬀerence, consistent with ex-
isting experiments. In contrast, a temperature gradient
in NM cannot eﬃciently induce a spin current.

and ∆T : αNM = 0, αFI = (TR − TL)/dFI = 104 K/m, and
∆T = 0 (black squares); αNM = αFI = 0, and ∆T = 10
K (red circles); αNM = (TR − TL)/dNM = 6.67 × 108 K/m,
αFI = 0, and ∆T = 0 (blue up triangles); αNM = 2.7 × 103
K/m, αFI = 9.0×103 K/m, and ∆T = 1 K (blue up triangles).

K temperature diﬀerence is on FI, NM or at the FI/NM
interface. The results are shown in Fig. 2 for αNM = 0,
αFI = (TR − TL)/dFI = 104 K/m, and ∆T = 0 (black
squares); αNM = αFI = 0, and ∆T = TR − TL = 10 K
(red circles); αNM = (TR − TL)/dNM = 6.67 × 108 K/m,
αFI = 0, and ∆T = 0 (blue up-triangles). Although the
thermal gradient in NM (αNM = 6.67 × 108 K/m) is four
orders of magnitude larger than that in FI (αFI = 104
K/m), the spin current due to αNM (up-triangles) is neg-
ligibly smaller than that due to αFI (squares), showing
ineﬀective generation of spin current by the thermal gra-
dient in NM. The purple down-triangles in Fig. 2 are
jFI→NM for αNM = 2.7 × 103 K/m, ∆T = 1 K, and
αFI = 9.0 × 103 K/m, corresponding to realistic thermal
conductivities of κFI = 6.0 W/(m · K) and κNM = 20
W/(m · K) for YIG and Pt [37], and the interfacial ther-
mal resistance of R = 1.8 × 10−5 K/(W/m2). Interest-
ingly, the spin current generated by a thermal gradient
in FI increase almost linearly with the temperature while
the spin current under a ﬁxed interfacial temperature dif-
ference saturates at a higher enough temperature.

The experimentally measured ISHE voltage V in open-
circuit comes from ISHE-induced charge accumulation.
According to above results, when TR > TL, spins along
the +z-direction move to the +x-direction. Due to the
ISHE, a charge current ﬂows along the +y-direction (elec-
trons ﬂow to the −y-direction), resulting in a charge ac-
cumulation in the front/back surfaces (xz-planes in Fig.
1) and a higher electric potential in the +y side than that
in the −y side as what was observed in experiment [11].
Reversing the direction of either the magnetization of FI
or the temperature gradient, the ISHE voltage V changes
