Abstract. We introduce an approximate method which can be used to simulate
the optical conductivity data of correlated multiband systems for normal and
superconducting cases by taking advantage of a reverse process of a usual optical
data analysis, which has been used to extract the electron-boson spectral density
function from measured optical spectra of single-band systems, like cuprates. We
applied this method to optical conductivity data of two multiband pnictide systems
(Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 and LiFeAs) and obtained the electron-boson spectral density
functions. The obtained electron-boson spectral density consists of a sharp mode
and a broad background. The obtained spectral density functions of the multiband
systems show similar properties as those of cuprates in several aspects. We expect that
our method helps to reveal the nature of strong correlations in the multiband pnictide
superconductors.

1. Introduction

Inelastic charge carrier scattering spectra of superconducting materials may contain
crucial
Particularly for
conventional superconductors this quantity has been successful to expose the electron-
phonon density (or glue) spectrum[1]. Optical spectroscopy has played an important
role to reveal the electron-phonon density spectrum along with tunneling and inelastic
neutron scattering spectroscopies[2, 3, 4].
For high-temperature superconducting
cuprate systems the electron-boson spectral density has been obtained by various
experimental techniques[5]. The mediated bosons in cuprates have been associated with
the antiferromagnetic spin-ﬂuctuations and there are a lot of experimental evidences
and theoretical interpretations to support the idea[6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

Iron-pnictides discovered by Kamihara et al.[11] have been known to have multiband
nature[12, 13, 14, 15]. For multigap superconducting (or multiband) systems the
process for extracting the electron-boson spectral density functions will be more
complex compared with that for cuprates (one-band systems) which have a single
d-wave superconducting gap. Many optical studies have been successfully done
on cuprate systems for delving and exposing the electron-boson spectral density
function[7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Recently some optical studies[22, 23, 24] have been
done on iron-pnictides to obtain the electron-boson density spectrum by using a single-
band approximation method, which has been used for studying cuprates. Charnukha et
al.[25] have tried to include the multiband coupling information obtained from speciﬁc
heat measurement study of the same material[26] and showed that observed unusual
structure of the optical conductivity in superconducting state can be ascribed to spin-
ﬂuctuation-assisted process. However, their method cannot be applicable to analyze
optical spectra directly. As far as the author knows reliable methods for obtaining the
electron-boson spectral density from optical data of multiband systems, iron-pnictides,
have not been developed yet.

In this paper we propose an approximate method which can be used to obtain
the electron-boson spectral density function from optical data of correlated multiband
superconductors by taking advantage of a reverse process reported recently by
Hwang[27]. We denote the electron-boson spectral density function as I 2χ(ω), where
I is the coupling constant between an electron and a mediating boson and χ(ω) is
the mediating boson spectrum. We started from two typical model I 2χ(ω) functions,
calculated the imaginary parts of the optical self-energy using the Allen’s formulas for
both normal and superconducting cases (here we need to know the impurity scattering
rate and additionally the superconducting gap for superconducting case), obtained the
corresponding real parts of the optical self-energy using a Kramers-Kronig relation
between imaginary and real parts of the optical self-energy, calculated the optical
conductivity spectra using an extended Drude model (here we need to know the plasma
frequency) from the calculated optical self-energy. We can get other optical constants
from the optical conductivity using the relations between them. We repeated the whole

process mentioned above for another transport channel with the same input I 2χ(ω),
diﬀerent impurity scattering rate, plasma frequency, and superconducting gap. Here
we made a rather radical assumption that I 2χ(ω) is the same for each channel; we
speculated that bosonic ﬂuctuations which contribute to the two channels are the same
and play the major role for the correlation between charge carriers in both channels.
We note that the channels are closely related to two diﬀerent superconducting gap
channels. Then eventually we could obtain a combined optical conductivity of the two
charge-transport channels by adding the two optical conductivity data obtained using
the reverse process. Then we compared the resulting combined optical conductivity with
the experimental measured optical data and, interestingly, found that the combined
conductivity could capture some characteristic features in the experimental data.
Therefore, we applied this method to the measured optical conductivity data through
a ﬁtting process and obtained the electron-boson spectral density functions of two
multiband pnictide systems: one is an optimally doped Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 and the other
LiFeAs. We compared the obtained electron-boson spectral density functions obtained
from pnictides optical data with those of cuprates and found that the spectral density
functions of two diﬀerent material systems showed common properties in several aspects.

2. Formalism

2.1. The reverse process and combined optical conductivity of two channels

In a (multiband) correlated material system the k-space averaged electron-electron
interaction through mediated bosons can be speciﬁed by an electron-boson spectral
density function (I 2χ(ω)), which can be measured by various spectroscopic techniques
including optical spectroscopy. In this section we introduce a reverse process[27], which
we use in this paper. In this process we start from an input I 2χ(ω). And the ﬁrst step is
that we obtain the imaginary part of the optical self-energy ( ˜Σop(ω) ≡ Σop
2 (ω))
from an input I 2χ(ω) using a generalized Allen’s formula[28] as

impurity scattering rate, which is a constant for normal case and is frequency-dependent
near the superconducting gap for superconducting case[28, 27]. In our simulations we
used the kernels of normal (T = 0 K) and s-wave superconducting states[27] as

for T = 0 K and for a ﬁnite temperature (0 < T < Tc) one can use the formula
approximately with the superconducting gap at that temperature instead of ∆0, which
is the maximum SC gap at T = 0 K. The impurity scattering rates [1/τ op

normal and s-wave superconducting states can be written as

where 1/τimp is a constant impurity scattering rate.
In our data ﬁtting we used the
so-called Shulga’s kernel (K(ω, Ω, T ))[29], which is valid for ﬁnite temperature (T >
0) with a constant density of states in normal state: K(ω, Ω, T ) = 2ω coth(Ω/2T ) −
(ω + Ω) coth[(ω + Ω)/2T ] + (ω − Ω) coth[(ω − Ω)/2T ], where T is the temperature. We
note that K(ω, Ω, 0) is the same as the Allen’s kernel for normal state in Eq. (2). And
then we obtained the real part of the optical self-energy (Σop
1 (ω)) from the calculated
imaginary part (Σop

where P stands for the principle part of the improper integral. We note that for the
Kramers-Kronig integration we produced data in a wide spectral range from zero to
around 7.1 eV, which seems to be large enough for our purpose (here we consider spectra
up to 0.3 eV for model calculations and up to 0.1 eV for applications to real systems).
For the higher energy up to inﬁnity we extended the data with a gradual drop up to ∼124
eV with an exponent (-1) of frequency and after then a free electron behavior. Finally
we get the complex optical conductivity (˜σ(ω) = σ1(ω) + iσ2(ω)) using an extended
Drude model as

˜σ(ω) =

(5)

where ωp is the plasma frequency of charge carriers, which can be speciﬁed for each
transport channel, and ˜Σop(ω) (= Σop
2 (ω)) is the complex optical self-energy.
In principle, using this complex optical conductivity we can calculate any other optical
constants including reﬂectance spectra[27].

1 (ω) + iΣop

Now we perform the same reverse process to get another complex optical
conductivity for another charge transport channel with the same I 2χ(ω) and diﬀerent
parameters:
impurity scattering rate and plasma frequency for normal case, and
additionally superconducting gap for superconducting case. Then we get the combined
optical conductivity of two transport channels, which can be related to two separate
bands in the Fermi surface, as

˜σtotal(ω) = ˜σch1(ω) + ˜σch2(ω),

(6)

where ˜σch1(ω) and ˜σch2(ω) are the complex optical conductivities of the channel 1 and
channel 2, respectively. We can simulate some characteristic structures in measured

Electron-boson spectral density function of correlated multiband systems obtained from optical data: Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 and LiFeAs5

optical conductivity spectra by using an input electron-boson spectral density and
appropriate ﬁtting parameters for the two channels. Therefore, we applied this
approximate method to optical data of multiband systems and obtained the electron-
boson spectral density. The detailed description of the ﬁtting process is given in the
section of ”Applications to real systems”.

2.2. The combined optical quantities from the ﬁtting

One can calculate other optical quantities from the combined optical conductivity
obtained using our analysis (or ﬁtting) method. The ﬁtted combined complex optical
conductivity can be written as ˜σf it(ω) = σf it,1(ω) + iσf it,2(ω), where the real and
imaginary parts can be obtained straightforward through the extended Drude formalism
using the ﬁtting parameters for each channel. The ﬁtted complex dielectric function can
be calculated using the general relationship between the optical conductivity and the
dielectric function as

˜f it(ω) = H + i

˜σf it(ω),

4π
ω

(7)
where H is the background dielectric constant and ˜f it(ω) ≡ f it,1(ω) + if it,2(ω).
The further calculations for reﬂectance (Rf it(ω)) and the optical scattering rate
(1/τ op
f it,2(ω)) can be done using the Fresnel’s equation and the extended
Drude formalism, respectively.

f it(ω) ≡ −2Σop

3. Model calculations

Now we introduce the way how we obtained the combined optical conductivity of
two transport channels starting from an input model I 2χ(ω) using the formalism
introduced in the previous section. We used two input model I 2χ(ω) functions
√
shown in Fig.
1(A): one is a sharp Gaussian peak (GP) model (solid line:
2π(d/2.35)] exp{−(ω − ω0)2/[2(d/2.35)2]} peaked at ω0 (30 meV) with the area
Agp/[
(Agp) of 50 meV and the width (d) of 10 meV and the other the well-known MMP
(Millis-Monien-Pines) model[30] (dash-dotted line: Am ω/(ω2 + ω2
m)) with a broad peak
at ωm (50 meV), the amplitude (Am) of 50 meV and the cutoﬀ frequency of 300 meV.
We calculated the imaginary part of the optical self-energy from the input I 2χ(ω) using
the Allen’s formula (Eq. (1) and Eq. (2)). We note that here we did not include the
impurity scattering rates since we will include them later on. The real parts are obtained
using the Kramers-Kronig relation (Eq. (4)). The calculated real and imaginary parts
of the optical self-energy of the two model I 2χ(ω) functions for normal (T = 0 K) and
superconducting (with the superconducting gap, ∆0 = 20 meV) cases are displayed in
Fig. 1(B) and Fig. 1(C), respectively. The sharp Gaussian peak (GP) model causes
pronounced peak features at ω0 (30 meV) and ω0 + 2∆0 (70 meV) for normal and
superconducting cases, respectively, and the corresponding imaginary parts show steep
step-like features where the real parts show the peak features, which is consistent with
reported results[31, 27]. The MMP model also shows similar but less pronounce features

as those for the Gaussian peak model since the MMP model has a broad peak.
In
principle the saturation of the optical scattering rate in high energy region is 2π times
the area under I 2χ(ω). The MMP model gives higher saturation level than GP models
since the area ((cid:39) 90 meV) under the MMP is larger than that (50 meV) of the GP
model. We note that, in general, the optical scattering rate reaches its saturation at
well above the cutoﬀ frequency of I 2χ(ω).

In Fig. 2(A) we display the real parts of the optical conductivity spectra of two
transport channels (σch1,1(ω): solid lines and σch2,1(ω): dashed lines) for the two model
I 2χ(ω) functions at normal state (T = 0 K). We take the plasma frequency, ωp,1 = 1.5
eV and the impurity scattering rate, 1/τimp,1 = 80 meV for the channel 1 and ωp,2 =
1.0 eV and 1/τimp,2 = 20 meV for the channel 2 to obtain the optical conductivity
from the calculated complex optical self-energy using the extended Drude model (Eq.
(5)). We note that here we included the impurity scattering rates in the imaginary
part of the optical self-energy,
imp is a constant
for normal case). In Fig. 2(B) we display the combined optical conductivity spectra
(σtotal,1(ω) ≡ σch1,1(ω) + σch2,1(ω)) of the two channels for the two I 2χ(ω) functions.

The combined spectra do not seem to show any additional features which might be
caused by the diﬀerent two channels because the two channels show similar curve shapes
and characteristic features at the same frequencies as shown in Fig. 2(A). However,
the corresponding combined imaginary parts of the optical self-energy (or the optical
scattering rates, 1/τ op
total,2(ω)) obtained using the extended Drude model
show additional structures below ∼30 meV as shown in Fig. 2C and the inset of Fig.
p,2, (cid:39) 1.8 eV)
to obtain the combined scattering rate. We can understand the additional structure if
we consider that while the two conductivities can be added linearly the corresponding
impurity scattering rates cannot be done so. We note that the additional structure
is not an issue of this paper. A characteristic feature appears at the sharp Gaussian
peak frequency (ω0) marked with a magenta arrow in both combined conductivity and
scattering rate spectra.
In general this characteristic frequency divides the optical
conductivity into two parts: the coherent and incoherent parts which are caused by
the correlation eﬀect[31].

In Fig. 3(A) we display the optical conductivity spectra of two transport channels
(σch1,1(ω): solid lines and σch2,1(ω): dashed lines) for the two model I 2χ(ω) functions at

(SC gap) for the channel 1 and ωp,2 = 1.0 eV, 1/τimp,2 = 20 meV and ∆0,2 = 40 meV (SC
gap) for the channel 2 to obtain the optical conductivity from the calculated complex
optical self-energy using the extended Drude model (Eq. (5)). We note that here we
included the impurity scattering rates in the imaginary part of the optical self-energy
for each channel, i.e., −2Σop

for SC case as in Eq. (3)). We can see clearly some pronounced features caused by
the superconducting gaps at 2∆0,i and by both the Gaussian peak and the SC gaps at
ω0 + 2∆0,i, where i = 1 or 2. In Fig. 3(B) we display the combined optical conductivity
data for the two model I 2χ(ω) functions. We can see the two channel contributions
separately in the combined conductivity since they have diﬀerent superconducting gaps;
the two superconducting gaps give diﬀerent onset frequencies (2∆0,1 = 40 meV for
channel 1 and 2∆0,2 = 80 meV for channel 2) as we marked with dark green arrows.

We also can clearly see features caused by the sharp Gaussian peak combined with
the SC gaps (ω0 + 2∆0,i, where i is 1 or 2) as marked with magenta arrows, of which
frequencies are located at local maximum slopes of the combined optical conductivity.
In Fig. 3(C) we display the corresponding combined optical scattering rates obtained
using the extended Drude model for the two I 2χ(ω) functions. We note that we used
the combined plasma frequency ((cid:39) 1.8 eV) to obtain the scattering rate. We can see
clearly the characteristic energy scales in the combined scattering rates as well. These
characteristic energy scales can be seen in the combined reﬂectance spectra and the
combined dielectric functions as well (not shown). We found from careful observation
that these characteristic features and energy scales seem to appear in measured optical
spectra of pnictides[32, 33]. So we tried to apply this approach to the real systems and
obtain the electron-boson spectral density I 2χ(ω) of the system. In the following section
we described our applications to two pnictide systems.

4. Applications to real systems

Here we applied our method to two multiband pnictide systems (Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2
(BKFA) and LiFeAs) and obtained the electron-boson spectral density functions,
I 2χ(ω)). We digitized published reﬂectance spectra[32] of BKFA sample and obtained
reﬂectance data of LiFeAs sample from one of the authors of a published paper[33]. And
then we performed a Kramers-Kronig analysis independently to get the optical constants
including the optical conductivity from the reﬂectance spectra.
It has been known
that the iron-pnictide materials including our two systems have low-energy interband
transitions down to ∼20 meV energy levels[33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. We need to remove
the interband transitions before application of the method since we apply our method
to the optical data up to 100 meV. However, the shape and intensity of the low-energy
interband transition in the optical conductivity are not well-established yet. Therefore,
we surveyed optical data published of four related pnictide systems (Co-, Ni-, and K-
doped BaFe2As2, and LiFeAs)[35, 36, 37, 38]. We separated the interband transition
components and averaged them; the averaged interband transition is displayed in dashed
orange lines in Fig. 4(A) and 4(C). Here we note that we do not use interband transitions
of Min et al. since their Drude modes seem to be too narrow (conﬁned below 1000 cm−1)
compared with results of other analyses which we use. We subtracted the averaged
interband transition from the optical conductivity spectra of BKFA and LiFeAs to
remove interband contributions. The adjusted optical conductivity data and ﬁts of
KBFA and LiFeAs are displayed in Fig. 4(A) and 4(C), respectively. We note that the
interband transition is not very large compared to the charge-carrier contributions in
the spectral ranges of interest.

We used a model I 2χ(ω) which consists of two Gaussian modes (one is sharp and
temperature-dependent and the other broad and temperature-independent). Here we
used a broad Gaussian mode instead of the MMP mode since the broad Gaussian mode
has one more parameter and is easier to describe a mode conﬁned in a spectral range

Electron-boson spectral density function of correlated multiband systems obtained from optical data: Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 and LiFeAs10

than the MMP mode. However, we expect that one can use a combination of a sharp
Gaussian mode and an MMP mode to obtain similar results as ours. In the case of the
combination of a Gaussian peak and an MMP mode one needs to impose a high-energy
cutoﬀ since the MMP mode spreads over a very wide spectral region. We note that
even though we impose constraints on the shape of I 2χ(ω) we still have some ﬂexibility
in the shape of resulting I 2χ(ω) and can determine a most probable I 2χ(ω) under the
constraints through our ﬁtting process. We have total 12 ﬁtting parameters (6 for two
Gaussian modes of the model I 2χ(ω), 2 impurity scattering rates, 2 plasma frequencies,
and 2 superconducting (SC) gaps for two transport channels) for SC state and 10 ﬁtting
parameters (here we do not need 2 SC gaps) for normal state.

We used known superconducting gaps of the two materials[32, 33]:

two
superconducting gaps of BKFA are 5.5 meV (∆0,1) and 12.5 meV (∆0,2)[32] and two
SC gaps of LiFeAs are 1.6 meV and 3.15 meV[33]. We took the sharp mode frequencies
from reported values by inelastic neutron scattering study of BKFA[39] and scanning

located at, respectively, 14 meV (denoted as ω0,SC) and 45 meV for BKFA[39] and at,
respectively, 8 meV (denoted as ω0,SC) and 30 meV for LiFeAs[24]. For normal state the
sharp mode (ω0,SC) in I 2χ(ω) for SC state should be broadened and moved to higher
energies (20 meV (ω0,N ) for BKFA and 12 meV for LiFeAs) to give less pronounced
curvature in the calculated conductivity at normal state (refer to Fig. 2(B)). We needed
a rather high low-energy cutoﬀ (10 meV) in I 2χ(ω) to capture the upturn at low energy
region. If we do not have the cutoﬀ the calculated upturn moves to higher energy and
deviates signiﬁcantly from the measured data. This cutoﬀ seems to be dependent on
material systems; LiFeAs shows lower cutoﬀ energy (see Fig. 4(D)). The higher cutoﬀ
energy seems to give the large coupling constant (λ) and the higher logarithmically
averaged frequency (ωln). The deﬁnitions of these two new quantities are given in the
last paragraph of this section. We do not know clearly physical origin of this low-energy
cutoﬀ at normal state yet.

While we did not need impurity scattering rates for both channels of BKFA we
needed the impurity scattering rates for the two channels (1/τimp,1 = 1/τimp,2 = 6.0
meV) of LiFeAs. Our impurity scattering rate of LiFeAs is consistent with a previous
reported value of the same system[24] and indicates that the LiFeAs crystal may contain
small amount of impurities. It is worth noting that two diﬀerent approaches (one is
with two Drude modes[33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42] and the other ours with two extended
Drude modes) may give diﬀerent ﬁtting parameters, particularly the impurity scattering
rates. Our approach explicitly includes the inelastic scattering between charge carriers
in the model calculations. The results of the approach with two Drude modes show
that at low temperature the two Drude modes have very diﬀerent scattering rates: one
Drude channel is in the clean limit while the other is in the dirty limit[15, 38, 41, 42].
In our approach with two extended Drude modes we have non-zero scattering rate at
zero frequency at ﬁnite temperatures and these values are proportional to the plasma
frequency squared, and have additional scattering rate at ﬁnite frequencies. Therefore,
one may not be able to compare the resulting parameters obtained from the two diﬀerent
approaches trivially. The ﬁtting plasma frequencies are 10,500 cm−1 (ωp,1) and 12,800
cm−1 (ωp,2) for normal state and 9800 cm−1 and 12,300 cm−1 for corresponding SC
state of BKFA, and 11,200 cm−1 and 5800 cm−1 for normal state and 10,500 cm−1 and
5300 cm−1 for SC state of LiFeAs. These plasma frequencies are not very diﬀerent
from reported Drude plasma frequencies obtained by two-Drude analyses of the both
sample systems[33, 35]. We note that the impurity scattering rates and the plasma
frequencies cannot be determined independently; they seem to be inter-related to each
other somehow in our method. The ﬁts seem to match quite well with the measured
conductivity spectra. The arrows show the positions of the characteristic energy scales
as we have shown in Fig. 3(B): the dark green arrows indicate the SC gaps (2∆0,1 and
2∆0,2) and the magenta arrows the sharp SC GP mode frequencies (ω0,SC) combined
with the SC gaps (2∆0,1 + ω0,SC and 2∆0,2 + ω0,SC).

We have two important remarks on our ﬁtting. First, we note that could not ﬁt the
adjusted data well with a single Gaussian mode. Here we consider the adjusted data of

Electron-boson spectral density function of correlated multiband systems obtained from optical data: Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 and LiFeAs12

Figure 5. (A) Two I 2χ(ω): one consists of a sharp Gaussian peak (denoted as GP)
and the other the GP mode plus a broad Gaussian background (BG) (denoted as
GP+Broad BG). (B) The adjusted optical conductivity of Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 (BKFA)

BKFA sample at superconducting state (4 K). In Fig 5(A) we show two I 2χ(ω): one is
the sharp Gaussian peak (denoted as GP) and the other the GP plus a broad Gaussian
background (BG) (denoted as GP+Broad BG). In Fig 5(B) the double dot-dashed
orange line is obtained using the GP I 2χ(ω) alone with the same plasma frequencies
(ωp,1 = 9800 cm−1 and ωp,1 = 12,300 cm−1) of the two channels as the ones which we
used to get the solid blue line, which is our ﬁt to the data. The dashed orange line
is obtained using the same GP but smaller plasma frequencies (ωp,1 = 8500 cm−1 and
ωp,1 = 10,500 cm−1) to match the combined conductivity with the data in low energy
region. But in this case we still cannot ﬁt the high energy region above 60 meV. So to
ﬁt the whole spectral range of interest we have to add the broad Gaussian BG mode in
the model I 2χ(ω) as we can see that the ﬁt with GP+Broad BG (blue solid line) shows
good match with the data (cyan solid line). Interestingly, the additional Gaussian BG
mode improves slightly the ﬁt between 20 and 40 meV as well. Secondly, we estimate
the accuracy of the sharp Gaussian peak position in the mode GP+Broad BG I 2χ(ω).
Fig 5(C-D) show how sensitive (or robust) the main sharp Gaussian peak (GP) position
is to the ﬁt. Here again we consider the adjusted data of BKFA at superconducting
state. We observe that when we shift the sharp GP mode located at 14 meV by ±10%
(or ± 1.4 meV) the resulting combined optical conductivity is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by
the shifts; -10% and +10% peak position shifts result in signiﬁcant (± ∼ 7% at 1000
Ω−1cm−1 level) shifts of the conductivity edge to lower (for -10% shift) and higher (for
+10% shift) energies. We estimate that the accuracy of the Gaussian peak position in
our ﬁtting is within ± ∼5% (or ± ∼0.7 meV) or better.

To see validity of our ﬁts further we calculated and compared other combined optical
quantities using the ﬁts to the adjusted optical conductivity data shown in Fig. 4(A) and
4(C). Other quantities are reﬂectance (R(ω)), the dielectric function (−ω21(ω)), and
the optical scattering rate (1/τ op(ω)). In Fig. 6(A)-(D) we display data and ﬁts of the
four optical quantities including the combined optical conductivity of the BKFA sample
at normal and superconducting states. We note that the all data here are raw spectra
(not adjusted). We described the formalism which we used to get those quantities in the
subsection of ”The combined optical quantities from the ﬁtting”. For the normal case
at 40 K of BKFA sample with no impurity scattering we had to take into account the
spectral weight which appears at zero frequency due to no impurity scattering; since we
dealt optical data at normal state we needed to subtract the contribution [2SW@0/(πω)]
of the spectral weight at ω = 0 from the imaginary part of the optical conductivity, where
SW@0 stands for the spectral weight at ω = 0. We used the spectral weight as 6.88×106
Ω−1cm−2; the corresponding plasma frequency is 0.92 eV or 7418 cm−1, which is smaller

plasma frequency obtained from the measured data is 1.01 eV or 8146 cm−1. We used
(7)) as 53 which is consistent with a
the background dielectric constant (H of Eq.
reported value of the same system[25]. Overall agreements between data and ﬁts for
all four quantities are good even though we do not include the low-energy interband
transitions in the ﬁts. This means that the two-independent complete optical data sets
(for example, σ1(ω) and 1(ω)) are ﬁtted simultaneously with the same I 2χ(ω) and the
ﬁtting parameters, which may indicate that our ﬁttings are reliable. We can see the
characteristic energy scales which are marked with arrows and vertical lines. We note
that here the plasma frequency, which we used for calculating the optical scattering rate,
can be any value as long as we used the same value for both data and ﬁts. The plasma
frequencies are 1.2 eV for BKFA and 1.0 eV for LiFeAs, respectively. Since we have
zero impurity scattering for BKFA sample the SC gap features do not appear clearly

quantities of LiFeAs sample for normal (23 K) and superconducting (4 K) cases. We
also note that the all data here are raw spectra (not adjusted). The superﬂuid plasma
frequency obtained from the measured data is 0.87 eV or 7016 cm−1, which is similar
to a reported value of the same system[33]. Since we have a ﬁnite impurity scattering
rate (6 meV) the SC gap features appear clearly in all four optical quantities. We used
the background dielectric constant (H) as 103, which is larger than that of BKFA; this
might be related to lower energy scales of LiFeAs compared with those of BKFA. Overall
agreements between data and ﬁts are quite good.

The coupling constant (λ ≡ 2(cid:82) ωc

0

(≡ exp[(2/λ)(cid:82) ωc

0 I 2χ(Ω)/Ω dΩ, where ωc is the cutoﬀ frequency)
can be obtained from the obtained I 2χ(ω). The coupling constants are 1.98 for
superconducting and 1.83 for normal states of BKFA and corresponding values of LiFeAs
are 1.72 (SC) and 1.37 (normal). The coupling constant at SC state is larger than that
at normal state. We crudely estimated the maximum SC transition temperatures (T max
)
∼= 1.13 ωln exp[−(λ + 1)/λ], where ωln
using a generalized McMillan equation (kBT max
ln Ω I 2χ(Ω)/Ω dΩ]) is the logarithmically averaged frequency). The
maximum Tc estimated are 44.1 K and 52.2 K for BKFA at 4 K and 40 K, respectively,
and 21.9 K and 21.2 K for LiFeAs at 4 K and 23 K, respectively. The maximum SC
transition temperatures are higher than the measured Tc of the two samples: Tc = 39.1
K for BKFA and 17.6 K for LiFeAs. The electron-boson spectrum obtained may be
enough to give the superconductivity in these materials. We note that the McMillan
formula was derived for a single gap system[43]. When we eliminate the broad Gaussian
background from the obtained I 2χ(ω) and recalculate the maximum Tc’s we have lower
maximum Tc’s than those obtained with including the broad Gaussian background as
31.4 K and 34.6 K at 4 K and 40 K for BKFA sample, respectively, and the corresponding
maximum Tc’s as 15.3 k and 13.1 K at 4 K and 23 K for LiFeAs sample, respectively.
For the both samples the new maximum Tc’s are lower than the actual Tc’s. Therefore,
the broad Gaussian background is necessary to give high enough maximum Tc’s; the
electron-boson spectral density necessarily consists of a sharp Gaussian peak and an
additional broad Gaussian background. The mode energy of the sharp Gaussian peak
of I 2χ(ω) at SC state can be scaled to Tc (ω0,SC = 4.1kBTc for BKFA and 5.2kBTc for
LiFeAs) as the magnetic resonance mode in cuprates (Eres = 5.4kBTc), where Eres is
the magnetic resonant mode energy[44]. The sharp Gaussian mode in I 2χ(ω) moves to
higher energy and becomes broadened as the sample temperature (T ) increases. The Tc-
and T -dependent properties of the obtained I 2χ(ω) are similar to those of cuprates[5].

5. Conclusions

We introduced an approximate optical method which could be used to obtain the
electron-boson spectral density function from the optical conductivity data of correlated
multiband systems. We found that the combined conductivity of two transport channels
obtained using this method clearly shows characteristic features of both channels,
particularly diﬀerent superconducting gaps and sharp peaks in the electron-boson

Electron-boson spectral density function of correlated multiband systems obtained from optical data: Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 and LiFeAs16

spectral density function (I 2χ(ω)). We also observed that similar characteristic features
appear in measured optical spectra of multiband pnictide systems. So we applied this
method to measured optical conductivity spectra of two iron-pnictide systems, BKFA
and LiFeAs and obtained the electron-boson spectral density functions, I 2χ(ω) of the two
multiband systems. The obtained I 2χ(ω) showed a common shape (a sharp peak and a
broad background) and similar temperature and superconducting transition temperature
(Tc) dependencies as I 2χ(ω) of cuprates does. As in cuprates many believe that in
iron-pnictides the mediated bosons are associated with the antiferromagnetic spin-
ﬂuctuations since the superconducting phase is located nearby the antiferromagnetic
one in the phase diagram. We expect that our method may open a new avenue for
analyzing optical data of correlated multiband systems and help to reveal the origin of
strong correlations in the systems.
