ABSTRACT

The hard X-ray detector (HXD) onboard Suzaku measured soft γ-rays from the Type Ia
supernova SN2014J at 77 ± 2 days after the explosion. Although the conﬁdence level of the signal
is about 90% (i.e., 2σ), the 3σ upper limit has been derived at < 2.2 × 10−4 ph s−1 cm−2 in the
170 – 250 keV band as the ﬁrst independent measurement of soft γ-rays with an instrument other
than INTEGRAL. For this analysis, we have examined the reproducibility of the NXB model
of HXD/GSO using blank sky data. We ﬁnd that the residual count rate in the 90 – 500 keV
band is distributed around an average of 0.19% with a standard deviation of 0.42% relative to the
NXB rate. The averaged residual signals are consistent with that expected from the cosmic X-ray
background. The ﬂux of SN2014J derived from Suzaku measurements taken in one snapshot at
t = 77 ± 2 days after the explosion is consistent with the INTEGRAL values averaged over the
period between t =50 and 100 days and also with explosion models of single or double degenerate
scenarios. Being sensitive to the total ejecta mass surrounding the radioactive material, the
ratio between continuum and line ﬂux in the soft gamma-ray regime might distinguish diﬀerent
progenitor models. The Suzaku data have been examined with this relation at t = 77 ± 2 days,
but could not distinguish models between single and double degenerate-progenitors. We disfavor
explosion models with larger 56Ni masses than 1 M⊙, from our 1σ error on the 170-250 keV X-ray
ﬂux of (1.2 ± 0.7) × 10−4 ph s−1 cm−2.

Introduction

Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are very bright
stellar explosions which are detectable at op-
tical wavelengths across cosmological distances.
It is widely accepted that they originate from
thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white
dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems.
They are
among the most matured standardizable candles
(Phillips et al. 1993; Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al.

brated relation between the optical peak luminos-
ity and the decline rate of the light curve in the
B-band.

ous possibilities,
it has been suggested to be a
strong probe to the mass of the explosion systems
(Sim & Mazzali 2008; Summa et al. 2013), i.e., ei-
ther a single Chandrasekhar-mass WD or merging
two WDs for which the total mass can exceed the
Chandrasekhar-mass.

However, the progenitors of Type Ia SNe have
been poorly constrained observationally despite
many on-going attempts (see e.g., Maoz, Mannucci, and Nelemans
2014, for reviews). There are several variants in
terms of the ignition and propagation of the ther-
monuclear ﬂame (Hillebrandt & Niemeyer 2000),
which can have diﬀerent characteristics in (1) the
evolution toward the explosion, and (2) in the
mass of the exploding WD. The evolution sce-
narios are roughly divided into two categories
referring to the nature of the progenitor sys-
tems; the single degenerate scenario (hereafter
SD; Whelan & Iben 1973; Nomoto 1982) (a C+O
WD and a main-sequence/red-giant companion)
or double degenerate scenario (hereafter DD;
Iben & Tutukov 1984; Webbink 1984) (a merger
of two C+O WDs). The mass of the exploding
WD(s) is linked to the progenitor systems and
their evolution scenario, which would aﬀects on
the cosmological usage of SN Ia as distance indi-
cators. In the SD scenario the most popular model
involves a Chandrasekhar-mass WD (e.g., Nomoto
1982). The original DD scenario is also asso-
ciated with the Chandrasekhar-mass WD (e.g.,
Iben & Tutukov 1984).
In a recently proposed
variant of the DD model, the so-called violent
merger model (Pakmor et al. 2010; R¨opke et al.
2012), the total mass of the ejecta (i.e., a sum of
the two WDs) can exceed the Chandrasekhar-mass
limit, a speciﬁc model of which is for example pre-
sented in Summa et al. (2013). Determining the
ejecta mass and/or the progenitor WD is therefore
of particular importance (e.g., Scalzo et al. 2014;
Yamaguchi et al. 2015; Katsuda et al. 2015).

Despite the strong motivation to analyze
the γ-ray emission from SNe Ia, no solid de-
tection had been reported until 2014,
includ-
ing attempts for SN1991T (Lichti et al. 1994;
Leising et al. 1995), SN1998bu (Georgii et al.
2002) and SN2011fe (Isern et al. 2013).
The
situation changed in 2014, after SN2014J was
discovered on 22 January 2014 (Fossey et al.
2014) in the nearby star-burst galaxy M82 at
the distance d ∼ 3.5 Mpc (Dalcanton et al. 2009;
Karachentsev & Kashibadze 2006) and was clas-
siﬁed as the closest Type Ia SN (Ayani 2014;
Cao et al. 2014; Itoh et al. 2014) in the last three
decades. The reconstructed date of the explosion
was 14.75 January 2014 (Zheng et al. 2014).
In
the MeV γ-ray band, the INTEGRAL satellite
made possible the ﬁrst detection of 56Co →56Fe
lines at 847 and 1238 keV at (2.34±0.74)×10−4 ph
cm−2 s−1 and (2.78±0.74)×10−5 ph cm−2 s−1, re-
spectively, in an average of the 50 to 100 days after
the explosion (Churazov et al. 2014; Diehl et al.
2015). Even at earlier phases of 20 days after the
explosion, the detection of 56 Ni →56Co lines at
152 and 812 keV at (1.10 ± 0.42) × 10−4 ph cm−2
s−1 and (1.90 ± 0.66) × 10−5 ph cm−2 s−1, respec-
tively, was reported (Diehl et al. 2014). Analysing
the time evolution of 56Co lines (Diehl et al. 2015;
Siegert & Diehl 2015), a 56Ni mass of 0.5 M⊙ was
derived. But a clear discrimination of models be-
tween SD and DD does not seem to be possible,
both from limitations of the measured γ-ray inten-
sity evolution and the theoretical prediction from
diﬀerent models.

As demonstrated in the optical

light curves
of SNe Ia, they produce a large amount of 56Ni
in the explosion, on average ∼ 0.6M⊙. Direct
measurements of γ-ray emission from the de-
cay chain, 56Ni →56Co →56Fe (Arnett 1979),
have been suggested to provide not only the di-
rect evidence for the thermonuclear nature of
SNe Ia (Ambwani & Sutherland 1988; Milne et al.
2004) but also various diagnostics to discrimi-
nate diﬀerent models (e.g., see Maeda et al. 2012;
Summa et al. 2013, for predictions based on multi-
dimensional explosion models).
Among vari-

These studies provided the ﬁrst detection of
nuclear γ-ray emission from SNe Ia, and indeed
the only detection of nuclear γ-ray emission from
objects beyond the local group of galaxies. This
detection relies on the SPI and IBIS instruments
on the same satellite INTEGRAL, and additional
conﬁrmation by a fully independent instrument is
important. Moreover, while these previous reports
mostly focused on the detection of the lines, a
wealth of additional information is contained in
the continuum emission. The MeV decay lines

are scattered down to lower energy by Comp-
ton scattering, creating continuum emission above
∼ 100 keV (e.g., Ambwani & Sutherland 1988;
Sim & Mazzali 2008; Summa et al. 2013). This
process is more important for more dense ejecta,
unlike the line strengths which become weaker for
more dense ejecta. Therefore, combining the in-
formation from the lines and the continuum, one
expects to obtain additional insight into the prop-
erties of the SN ejecta that is then linked to the
progenitor star. Indeed, the detection of contin-
uum in the energy range of 200 − 400 keV by IN-
TEGRAL was reported by Churazov et al. (2014).
In this paper, we report a measurement of the γ-
ray continuum from SN 2014J with the Suzaku
X-ray satellite (Mitsuda et al. 2007). In sections
2 and 3 and we test several explosion models to
constrain the mass of 56Ni and the mass of the
exploding WD system in section 4.

2. Observation and Data Reduction

2.1. ToO Observation with Suzaku

The X-ray satellite Suzaku carries two ac-
tive X-ray instruments onboard (Mitsuda et al.
2007);
the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS;
Koyama et al. 2007) and the hard X-ray detec-
tor (HXD; Takahashi et al. 2007) to observe the
0.2 – 12 keV and the 13 – 600 keV bands, respec-
tively. The HXD is a hybrid detector with PIN-
type Si photo-diodes for the 13 – 70 keV band
and phoswitch-type scintillation counters using
Gd2SiO5 (hereafter GSO) crystals surrounded by
Bi4Ge3O12 (hereafter BGO) crystals for the 60 –
600 keV band (Takahashi et al. 2007).
It has a

comparable or better sensitivity than that of IN-
TEGRAL instruments in the 60 – 200 keV band
on an ’one-shot’ short observation and therefore,
it is suitable for our purpose to independently
detect the soft γ-ray emission from SN2014J.

We triggered ToO observation of SN2014J with
Suzaku from 2014 March 30 12:18 UT to 3 April
17:23 UT (OBSID=908005010), which is about
t = 77 ± 2 days after the explosion of SN2014J,
soon after the day when the sun angle allows the
satellite operation. The target position was set to
(α, δ)[J2000] = (09h55m42.12s, +69◦40′26.0”) at
the XIS nominal pointing position. The HXD was
operated in the nominal mode; the bias voltages
for one half of 64 PIN diodes were operated at 400
V and the other half at 500 V, and the photo-
multipliers for scintillators were operated in the
nominal setting of the high voltages. We also used
previous observations towards the M82 region be-
fore the explosion of SN2014J for comparison in
later sections. The observation in 2014J with OB-
SID=908005010 (hereafter OBS2014) and previ-
ous ones are summarized in Table 1.

2.2. Data Reduction

The observation data-sets were processed by
the standard Suzaku pipeline version 2.8.20.35,
with the calibration version (CALDBVER) of
hxd20110913, xis20121106, xrt20110630, and
xrs20060410 for OBS2014. In the analysis of other
OBSIDs in the following Section 3, all the data
are reprocessed by the ftool,
’aepipeline’, with
the latest CALDB ﬁles with equivalent version of
OBS2014. Spectral ﬁtting was performed with
XSPEC version 12.8.1g in HEADAS 6.15.1 pack-

age. Background was estimated from models for
instrumental (i.e., ’non-X-ray’) background plus
cosmic diﬀuse X-ray background, both ﬁtted to
the SN2014J and other independent data (see be-
low).

We did not use the XIS data, because bright
X-rays from the ultra-luminous source M82 X-1
strongly contaminated the SN2014J region.

Cleaned event lists of the HXD are obtained
by the standard selection criteria. The net ex-
posure for the HXD is 193.9 ks. The non-X-
ray background (NXB) is estimated using the
methods described in Fukazawa et al. (2009). We
used the NXB events of both PIN and GSO with
METHOD=”LCFITDT (bgd d)” and the version
of METHODV=2.6ver1110-64. Here, if we sub-
tract NXB events from OBS2014 data, the net
count rates of PIN and GSO are (2.6 ± 0.1) × 10−1
c s−1 and (1.8 ± 0.1) × 10−2 c s−1, respectively,
in the 13 – 70 or the 90 – 500 keV bands, respec-
tively. Count rates for other observations towards
M82 than OBS2014 are also summarized in Table
1.

On the HXD PIN detector, the count rate of
OBS2014 in Table 1 shows no signiﬁcant excess
over the others. According to Miyawaki et al.
(2009), most of PIN signals can be considered as
hard X-rays from the ULX M82 X-1, whereas γ-
rays from Type Ia SNe should be weak in this
energy band below 100 keV (Maeda et al. 2012;
The & Burrows 2014). Therefore, in the follow-
ing sections, we concentrate on checking the de-
tectability of γ-rays from SN2014J with the HXD
GSO in the energy band above 90 keV.

3. Analysis and Results

3.1. Signal Level compared with the Sys-

tematics of Non X-ray background

The systematic error is mainly determined by
the reproducibility of the NXB model, which is
about 1 % or less for GSO in more than 10 ks
exposure (Fukazawa et al. 2009). For OBS2014,
it was conﬁrmed with the earth occultation data
during the observation, whose exposure is only
17.7 ks with standard criteria of Cut-oﬀ-Rigidity
or 21.5 ks when we do not exclude data with bad
conditions of Cut-oﬀ-Rigidity (see Table 2). We
estimated a systematic uncertainties of 0.1 – 0.6
% (except for one energy bins (iii) and (vii) in
the table). Note that the deﬁnition of energy bins
in Table 2 is determined by bins in the NXB es-
timation by Fukazawa et al. (2009).
In order to
perform a more precise check on the reproducibil-
ity of the GSO NXB models for longer exposures
than 21.5 ks during the sky observations (i.e.,
not earth occultation data), we estimated them
with the “blank sky” observations for the HXD
GSO. Among all the Suzaku observations after the
launch in 2005 to 2014, we ﬁrst picked up 140 ob-
servations whose exposures of the XIS exceed 120
ks, and then selected “blank sky” observations for
GSO with the following criteria: (1) PIN counts
in the 50 – 60 keV or the 60 – 70 keV bands do not
exceed 3.5% of the NXB models, (2) GSO counts
in the 90 – 500 keV do not exceed 2.0% of the NXB
models, or the number of energy bands in which
GSO counts exceed 1.0% of each NXB level is less
than half (i.e., 3 among 7 bands deﬁned in Table
2), (3) the systematic errors of GSO NXB models
estimated by the earth data do not exceed 2 %. Fi-

of blank sky observations (Table 3) from the NXB
models in the 90 – 500 keV band are shown in
the histograms. Distribution for all the 37 obser-
vations is shown in black and that for 7 selected
observations taken within 2 months before or after
the SN2014J observation (i.e., OBSIDs in Table3
with note e) are in cyan. The best-ﬁt Gaussian
models for them are plotted in red. For compar-
ison, the average value for all the blank sky ob-
servations (whose spectrum is shown in Figure 5
blue) is shown in dark green line, and the CXB
levels by HEAO-1 (Boldt 1987; Gruber 1999) are
shown in the green hatched box. The residual from
the NXB model for OBS2014 is shown in the pur-
ple with arrow.

nally, we got 37 “blank sky” observations as listed
in Table 3. The total exposure of them is 4.49
Ms. The reproducibility of the GSO NXB model
for each observation is also listed in the table. As
a result, the reproducibility of NXB models dis-
tributes in 0.19 ±0.42 % for all the 37 observations
or 0.34 ±0.28 % for observations near the SN2014J
date, with 1σ errors, as demonstrated in Figure 1.
Note that this discrepancy (i.e., 0.19% oﬀset here)
between blank sky observation and NXB models
comes from a contamination of CXB emission in
the ﬁeld of view of the HXD GSO and from the
Earth’s albedo emission included in NXB models;
the eﬀect is seen in green lines of Figure 1 and is

numerically estimated in Section 3.2. The stan-
dard deviation (0.42%) corresponds to 42% of the
NXB-subtracted GSO signals of OBS2014 in the
same energy range.

The NXB-subtracted X-ray spectra in OBS2014
are shown in Figure 2. The systematic errors of
NXB models for HXD PIN and GSO are included
in the plots; systematics for PIN NXB is set to be
3% (Fukazawa et al. 2009) and those for GSO is
set to values in Table 2 determined by the short
earth occultation data of this observation as the
worst cases. Therefore, the GSO data in OBS2014
are still signiﬁcant in energy bins (iv), (v), (vi) in
Table 2, whereas those in previous observations
towards M82 are not signiﬁcant as plotted in Fig-
ure 3. In summary, we detected marginal signals
from OBS2014 in the 90 – 500 keV band with
about 90% conﬁdence level (i.e., about 2σ).

We now discuss in more detail the GSO signals
in the three energy bins (iv), (v), (vi) in Table
2, which corresponds to the 170 – 350 keV band,
which turn out to be most signiﬁcant in Figure 2.

×10−11 erg cm−2 s−1 in the 13
−0.08
to 70 keV band with a reduced χ2 of 0.80 under 12
degrees of freedom. Instead, the multi-color disk
model (Mitsuda et al. 1984) is also used to repre-
sent the ULX spectra in several phases, and is al-
ways below the power-law model in the harder X-
ray band. We therefore consider above power-law
estimation as conservative, and the value above
corresponds to the upper limit of the contribution
of M82 X-1 in the GSO band by an extrapola-
tion from the best-ﬁt power-law model in the PIN
band.
In addition, the ULXs is usually variable
(Miyawaki et al. 2009) as is also seen in Figure
4, but the uncertainty on the ﬂux from the PIN
measurement here is about 5 %. Therefore, the
contamination from ULX is about < 1.0 ± 0.2 %
of the GSO signal in the 170–350 keV band.

as red crosses of Figure 2 (i.e., PIN and GSO
spectra taken in OBS2014, which are shown in
black and red, respectively,
in this plot), with
the best-ﬁt power-law model in magenta to re-
produce the PIN data. The bottom panel shows
the chi values to this model. Similarly, best-ﬁt
power-law models determined in other observa-
tions (OBSID=100033010, 100033020, 100033030,
and 702026010; Miyawaki et al. 2009) are also
plotted for GSO in blue.

In Figure 5, the GSO data of OBS2014 is com-
pared with the canonical CXB model by HEAO-
1 (Gruber 1999), which is conﬁrmed with the
recent hard X-ray observation with Swift BAT
(Ajello et al. 2008). For reference, another CXB
model by Boldt (1987) is also plotted but is not
valid above the 100 keV band. The CXB mod-
els were folded into the data space using the cor-

Fig. 3.— Same spectra as Figure 2, but before
OBS2014 (see Table 1). Panels from the top to
bottom represent the X-ray spectra in OBSID =
100033010, 100033020, 100033030, and 702026010,
respectively.

The hard X-ray emission from M82 X-1 can be
estimated by the direct and simultaneous measure-
ments with HXD PIN in the 13 – 70 keV band.
The PIN spectrum in OBS2014 is well described
by the single power law model, which is usually
used for a ULX (Miyawaki et al. 2009). The best
ﬁt model has a photon index of 3.93+0.43
−0.40 and an X-

7

responding detector’s angular response, which is
consistent with the estimation by a full Monte
Carlo simulation on Suzaku spacecraft with the
Geant4 toolkit (Terada et al. 2005). The uncer-
tainty on the angular response of GSO is checked
by multiple pointing observation of Crab nebula
(Kokubun et al. 2007) but is not well derived yet.
Therefore, we employ two alternatives; a) pulse
height spectrum estimated from CXB model by
Gruber (1999) with the angular response, and b)
the hard X-ray spectrum with the HXD GSO on
the blank sky observations described in Section 3.1
In case a), we put 10 % uncertainty on the CXB
spectral model as described in Ajello et al. (2008).
As plotted in Figure 5, the X-ray ﬂux in 200 – 500
keV band of these two are consistent with each
other within 0.6σ error, whereas the latter tend
to have harder spectral shape (see Section 4.3 for
detail). In the next section, we use both spectra
for the CXB emission and then combine the two
results to include systematic errors for the CXB
estimation.

An additional systematic uncertainty may arise
from the contribution of the Earth albedo emission
in the NXB model estimated from the Earth occul-
tation data. This is not considered in the current
NXB model by Fukazawa et al. (2009). The X-ray
spectrum of the Earth albedo emission can be sep-
arated from the CXB spectra by changing the cov-
erage of the Earth within the ﬁeld of view as has
been done by the Swift BAT detector (Ajello et al.
2008), but this method does not work for the HXD
GSO in principle because of the design concept of
the narrow ﬁeld-of-view detector (Takahashi et al.
2007). Using the dependence of the Earth albedo
level on the geomagnetic latitudes and the incli-
nation angle i of the spacecraft orbit to the Earth
equator, the albedo for Suzaku at i = 31 deg is
simply interpolated between the Swift measure-
ment (Ajello et al. 2008) at i = 20 deg and bal-
loon experiments at the polar and at the equator
(Imhof et al. 1976). In this interpolation, we as-
sume a systematic error of 25%. Such albedo emis-
sion in the NXB model contributes to increase a
signal level compared with the CXB emission, but
at only about 10% of the CXB level by Gruber
(1999), as plotted in Figure 5. Therefore, this
causes about 1 % uncertainty for the GSO signal.
In summary, we have to subtract contributions
of ULX and CXB emission from the GSO signals

errors and systematic errors of the NXB model
and Earth albedo estimation. The Cosmic X-
ray backgrounds with HEAO-1 reported by Boldt
(1987) and Gruber (1999) are shown in blue lines,
and the Earth albedo estimated for Suzaku from

of 4.49 M sec) is also plotted in blue crosses,
where the error bars contain systematic errors in
the NXB model and the Earth albedo. Green
line represents the ULX spectrum estimated by
HXD PIN (same as magenta line in Figure 4).
In conversion from CXB model
into the data
space, we used the GSO response matrix for a
ﬂat ﬁeld emission, accumulated eﬀective areas in
the Auxiliary-Response-File (ARF) database in
CALDB (ae hxd gsoart 20051126.ﬁts).

and add the Earth’s albedo to them of OBS2014
and the blank-sky observation (not to CXB mod-
els). Numerically, the contributions of ULX, a)
CXB (Gruber 1999) or b) blank sky spectrum, and
the Earth albedo emission to the NXB-subtracted
GSO signals (albedo emission added) are 1%, 49%,
39%, and 3%, respectively, in the 170 – 250 keV
band. Therefore, the GSO signal towards M82 in
2014 still remains at 4.0 or 2.5 σ signiﬁcance for
case a) and b), respectively, in the 170 – 250 keV
band i.e., energy bins (iv) and (v) in Table 2, even
after subtraction of the ULX and CXB emissions.

of Cosmic X-ray background from the GSO data
in the ﬁtting, instead of the blank sky data.
In
this ﬁtting, the statistical errors and systematics
of NXB model, CXB model, and the Earth albedo
estimations are considered.

3.3. Hard X-ray ﬂux from SN2014J

In order to derive the X-ray ﬂux from GSO
signals numerically, we performed spectral ﬁttings
with a power-law model on the GSO spectrum af-
ter the subtraction of the NXB (Section 3.1) and
the CXB with consideration of the Earth albedo
(Section 3.2). We tried two cases of CXB mod-
els (cases a) and b) in Section 3.2) to represent
uncertainties of the CXB in the ﬁtting. The best
ﬁt models are shown in Figure 6 and the hard X-
ray ﬂux in the 170 – 250 keV band is found as
(0.9+0.4
−0.3) × 10−4 ph s−1 cm−2 or (1.6 ± 0.4) × 10−4
ph s−1 cm−2 for cases a) and b) with 1σ errors,
respectively. As shown in Figure 7, the normaliza-

or HEAO-1 Model by Gruber (1999) are used as
the Cosmic X-ray background level, respectively.
The + marks show the best ﬁt values, and the the

tion of the power-law model becomes zero at 99%
signiﬁcance level for case a) and the signiﬁcance of
the measured signal is about 90% conﬁdence level
(i.e., 2σ) in total, as already described in section
3.1. Therefore, we conclude that the Suzaku con-
stain the X-ray ﬂux of SN2014J to below 2.2×10−4
ph s−1 cm−2 at the 170 – 250 keV band (3σ limit).

4. Discussion

4.1. Detection of γ−rays with Suzaku

From the hard X-ray observation of SN2014J
with Suzaku HXD at t = 77 ± 2 days after the
explosion (Section 2), the hard X-ray ﬂux in the
170 – 250 keV band is constrained with the 99%
(3σ) upper limit of < 2.2 × 10−4 ph s−1 cm−2.
This measurement complements the INTEGRAL
measurements of soft X-ray band ﬂux, at similar
sensitivity obtained with a shorter exposure.

The Suzaku upper limit at 77 ± 2 days is con-
sistent with those reported by INTEGRAL for the
continuum emission in the 200 – 400 keV band at
(2.0 ± 0.8) × 10−4 ph s−1 cm−2 at 75 ± 25 days
1 within errors if we correct the energy width as-
suming a ﬂat spectrum as indicated by the spec-

1the value by INTEGRAL is found only in the archive (as-
troph/1405.3332) of Churazov et al. (2014)

tral models of Maeda et al. (2012). If we take the
68% conﬁdence levels (i.e., equivalent to the 1σ
errors) in the systematic and statistical uncertain-
ties of the Suzaku measurement, the X-ray ﬂux
becomes (1.2 ± 0.7) × 10−4 ph s−1 cm−2 in the
same energy range. This is consistent with INTE-
GRAL results within uncertainties. The consis-
tency can be found in Figure 8, which shows the
photon spectra estimated by the best-ﬁt power-
law models in cases a) and b), compared with the
spectra by Churazov et al. (2015).

Fig. 8.— Red and black plots represent the photon
spectra converted from the raw spectra in Figure
6, assuming the power-law model with the best-ﬁt
values for the data whose CXB component are set
to the blank sky data (see the text) or the spectral
model by Gruber (1999), respectively. Crosses and
lines for them represent the data and the best-ﬁt
models, respectively. For reference, photon spec-
tra with the INTEGRAL ISGRI at 50 – 162 days
(Figure 8 blue in Churazov et al. 2015) is also
plotted in magenta crosses. Green and blue lines
shows the spectral models of W7 (Maeda et al.
2012) and the white dwarf merger (Summa et al.
2013), respectively, at the 75 days after the explo-
sion with the 56Ni mass of ∼ 0.6M⊙.

4.2. Type Ia SN models

At ∼ 70 days after the SN Ia explosion, decays
of 56Co to 56Fe provide a major input into high
energy radiation and thermal energy of the SN
ejecta. The strongest lines are those at 847 keV
and 1238 keV. The annihilation of positrons from
this β+ decay also produces either strong lines
at or continuum below 511 keV. This high-energy

10

radiation is degraded to lower energy by Comp-
ton scattering, and below ∼ 200 keV the photons
are absorbed by photoelectric absorption. These
processes create characteristic continuum emission
from SNe Ia in the hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray
regimes.

Figure 8 shows the photon spectrum obtained
by the Suzaku observation. This photon spectrum
is constructed assuming a power law, and with the
assumption of the best-ﬁt power-law models either
by a) the CXB model by Gruber (1999) or by b)
the blank sky observations. In the same ﬁgure, the
synthetic spectra of the W7 model (Maeda et al.
2012) and the violent merger model of a 0.9M⊙
and a 1.1M⊙ WD (Summa et al. 2013) are com-
In these models, the 56Ni-rich region, as
pared.
well as the layers of intermediate-mass elements
above the 56Ni-rich region, serve as the Compton-
scattering layers. The W7 and delayed detona-
tion models are (more or less) spherical, while the
merger model has a large asymmetry in the distri-
bution of the ejected material. In Figure 8, we only
show the angle-averaged model spectra; the view-
ing angle eﬀect is considered later. Both models
have M (56Ni) ∼ 0.6M⊙, which is consistent with
what is inferred from optical properties (e.g., peak
luminosity) of SN 2014J (Ashall et al. 2014).

The photon ﬂux at 170-250 keV, taking our
2σ signal, is indeed consistent with these mod-
els, within a systematic error related to the CXB.
Above ∼ 300 keV, the nominal ﬂux level in the
Suzaku spectrum is above the level of the CXB (for
both CXB models), leaving no residual SN2014J
signal contribution, within uncertainties.

The most important diﬀerence in these two
models is the total mass of the exploding system.
The W7 model (Nomoto 1982) is a representa-
tive of an explosion of a single Chandrasekhar-
mass WD and the expected γ-ray emission is sim-
ilar to other model variants such as deﬂagration-
in a Chandrasekhar-mass
detonation models
(Maeda et al. 2012). On the other hand,
in
the violent merger model both of the (sub-
Chandrasekhar-mass) WDs are disrupted, leading
to the super-Chandrasekhar mass for this partic-
ular model presented here (Pakmor et al. 2012;
R¨opke et al. 2012; Summa et al. 2013). In terms
of the expected γ-ray signals, the two models are
characterized by diﬀerent optical depth to γ-rays
through Compton scattering. The violent merger

model has more massive ejecta and thus is more
opaque (by a factor of about two), leading to a
higher level of Compton continuum in the energy
range of Suzaku observations. This diﬀerence is
seen in Figure 8.

Figure 9 shows the light curves integrated in
the energy range of 170 − 250 keV for various
models, as well as the evolution of the ratio of
the same continuum ﬂux to the 847 keV line ﬂux.
The Suzaku upper limit and 1σ data are also
plotted as an one snapshot point at t = 77 ± 2
days thanks to the low-background capability of
the HXD. For the ratio, we took the ﬂux from
the INTEGRAL observation at t = 75 ± 25 days
after the explosion (Churazov et al. 2014). We
adopt the energy range of 170 − 250 keV since
this corresponds to the marginally detected sig-
nal by Suzaku at 2σ. Shown in the ﬁgure are
the W7 model, 2D delayed detonation models
(Maeda et al. 2012) and the violent merger model
of Pakmor et al. (2012) for which gamma-ray ob-
servables have been presented by Summa et al.
(2013). The delayed detonation models were com-
puted for diﬀerent initial conditions (always with
the assumption of a Chandrasekhar-mass WD),
covering a wide range of M (56Ni). The models
with M (56Ni) = 0.47 − 0.72M⊙ are indicated by
yellow curves, and the W7 model and the violent
merger model both have ∼ 0.6M⊙ of 56Ni syn-
thesized in the explosion. These are models com-
patible to the optical features of SN 2014J. The
emission from the violent merger model is sensi-
tive to the viewing angle even at ∼ 60 − 80 days,
and thus this is shown for various viewing angles.
It is seen that for a similar amount of 56Ni, the
violent merger model having super-Chandrasekhar
mass in the total ejecta, predicts a larger ﬂux than
the models with Chandrasekhar-mass WD progen-
itors. This is a result of the larger optical depth
as explained above. Within the observational er-
ror, all the models are consistent with the Suzaku
data.

The diﬀerence between the violent merger
model and the other explosion models becomes
clearer in the evolution of the ﬂux ratio. Indeed,
the ratio of the continuum ﬂux to the line ﬂux
has been suggested to be a diagnostic to distin-
guish the progenitor WD mass (Sim & Mazzali
2008; Summa et al. 2013) – In case of two mod-
els producing the similar amount of 56Ni, a larger

11

amount of material surrounding the radioactive
isotopes (for the larger WD mass) will convert a
larger fraction of the line ﬂux to the Compton
down-scattered continuum ﬂux. Therefore the
ratio of the continuum to the line ﬂux directly
mirrors the ejecta mass. This shows that it is in
principle possible to constrain the total mass of
the ejecta, thus the mass of the progenitor WD,
through γ-ray observations. Unfortunately, the
uncertainty in the Suzaku observation turned out
to be too large to discriminate the models, even
if we adopt the 1σ error rather than the 3σ upper
limit. Unfortunately no constraint is obtained at
a 3σ level, but it could already start to constrain
some extreme models while at a 1σ level; the ratio
predicted for some 2D delayed detonation models
is below the Suzaku point beyond 1σ error (i.e.,
the yellow lines below the data point in the lower
panel of Figure 9), irrespective of the CXB model.
All of these models have M (56Ni) > 1M⊙. These
models have an extended distribution in 56Ni, and
thus have small optical depths, leading to a low
ratio. We thus reject, while at a 1σ level, the
models with such a large amount of 56Ni from
the γ-ray signal alone fully independently of the
optical emission.

4.3. CXB measurement with the HXD

Very few models are reported for CXB emis-
sion in an energy band above 100 keV. In Sec-
tion 3.2, the hard X-ray spectrum with the HXD
GSO in the 100 – 500 keV band is presented in
Figure 5 and compared with the canonical CXB
model by Gruber (1999).
In the following ﬁt-
tings, the Earth’s albedo emission estimated in
Section 3.1 is added to the NXB-subtracted spec-
trum of the blank sky observations. Overall un-
certainties on CXB model (10 % from Ajello et al.
(2008)), angular response matrix (4 % due to
shade structure opaque to the sun in the X-ray
mirror in Figure 11 of Terada et al. (2005)), NXB
estimation (0.19% from Section 3.1), and Earth’s
albedo emission (25% from Section 3.1), are also
included. If we assume that the spectral shape of
CXB is given by Gruber (1999), the X-ray ﬂux
of the HXD/GSO blank-sky observation becomes
0.7 ± 0.2 times larger than the value of Gruber
model. Numerically, it is (2.8 ± 0.8) × 10−2 ph s−1
cm−2 str−1 or (1.3±0.3)×10−8 erg s−1 cm−2 str−1
in the 200 – 500 keV band, where the errors rep-

Fig. 9.— The model light curves from some SN Ia models are compared with the Suzaku observations result.
The upper panel shows the ﬂux integrated in the energy of 170 − 250 keV, while the lower panel shows the
ratio of the 170 − 250 keV ﬂux to the 847 keV line ﬂux. The 3σ upper limit is shown by a gray area, while
the ﬂux of the marginal detection is shown by an open square with an error of 1σ. The models shown here
are the W7 model (green: Nomoto 1982), two-dimensional delayed-detonation models with various ignition
conditions (yellow and orange: Maeda et al. 2010, 2012), and a violent merger of a 1.1M⊙ and a 0.9M⊙
WD (cyan and blue: R¨opke et al. 2012; Summa et al. 2013). For the violent merger model, the same model
viewed from diﬀerent directions (cyan) are shown together with an angle-averaged emission (blue). For
the delayed-detonation models, the angle-variation is not large at these epochs, and only angle-averaged
behaviors are shown for 32 models covering a range of M (56Ni). Models with M (56Ni) = 0.47 − 072M⊙,
which are compatible to observational features of SN 2014J (Ashall et al. 2014), are shown by orange curves,
while the other models with larger/smaller M (56Ni) are shown by yellow curves.

resent statistics only. If we reproduce the blank-
sky spectrum with a simple power-law model, the
photon index becomes harder than that of Gruber
(1999) at 1.2+1.3
−1.0 and the X-ray ﬂux becomes con-
sistent with Gruber (1999) at (5.1+2.5
−2.6) × 10−2 ph
s−1 cm−2 str−1 or (2.6 ± 1.3) × 10−8 erg s−1 cm−2
str−1 in the 200 – 500 keV band, whereas the Gru-
ber model corresponds to 4.1 × 10−2 ph s−1 cm−2
str−1 or 1.9 × 10−8 erg s−1 cm−2 str−1 in the same
energy band. Therefore, the X-ray spectrum of
the blank sky observation with GSO reproduces
the CXB model by Gruber (1999) within statisti-
cal errors.

4.4. Future Perspectives

A next-generation X-ray satellite Hitomi (named
ASTRO-H before launch; Takahashi et al. 2014)
has been successfully launched on 17 Feb 2016

and higher sensitivities than those of the HXD
PIN/GSO or SPI/ISGRI on INTEGRAL will be
achieved soon. The background level of the soft
gamma-ray detector (SGD; Tajima et al. 2010;
Watanabe et al. 2012; Fukazawa et al. 2014) on-
board Hitomi will be reduced by one order of
magnitude compared to the HXD and therefore
soft γ-ray spectra from a future close-by Type-Ia
SNe can be precisely measured as demonstrated
in Maeda et al. (2012). Thus, we can distinguish
the explosion models between single and double
degenerate progenitors as indicated in Figure 9.
In distinctions of explosion models on Figure 9,
Suzaku demonstrated the importance of the snap-
shot measurement achieving high sensitivity in
a shorter exposure (±2 days) than INTEGRAL
(±25 days). In addition, we demonstrated in this
paper that for future observations the reﬁnement

12

of the CXB spectral model is of critical impor-
tance.
