Monochalcogenide monolayers undergo a phase transition from a rectangular onto a square unit
cell at ﬁnite temperature Tc. Here, we study the nature of this transition in few-layer monochalco-
genides and its consequences for material properties, focusing on GeSe and SnSe monolayers and
bilayers as prototypical examples. Despite of the structural disorder, no in-gap states develop at
Tc. Nevertheless, the spin polarization of the conduction valley along the Γ − Y direction be-
comes degraded with temperature. The Y − and X−points become eﬀectively equivalent at Tc,
and the optical absorption band edge becomes unpolarized as a result. The average magnitude of
the electric dipole moment vanishes at the transition temperature as well. This comprehensive set
of results uncovers temperature as a fundamental control knob for applications based on few-layer
monochalcogenides.

Few-layer monochalcogenides are a new platform for
phenomena in low dimensional systems that is being in-
tensely explored now [1–8]. Monolayers of these materials
have a four-fold degenerate ground state [9] that leads to
two-dimensional disorder at ﬁnite temperature (T ) [9–
11]. Disorder at individual layers underpins the phase
transition observed in bulk layered monochalcogenides
[12–15].

The promise of these materials rests on potential ap-
plications at ﬁnite temperature, making it imperative
to predict the evolution of their properties [1–7] under
thermal variations. Does thermal disorder induce in-gap
states? Is spin-splitting robust at room temperature?
Can the valley degree of freedom be even deﬁned at the
transition temperature? How do mobility, optical absorb-
tion, and electric dipole properties evolve with temper-
ature? These pressing questions for the development of
this ﬁeld are answered within the context of monolayers
(MLs) and bilayers (BLs) of GeSe and SnSe here.

We begin by comparing the phase transition occurring
in MLs with that in BLs. This is accomplished in Fig. 1
by displaying the temperature derivative of the average
total energy (cid:104)E(cid:105), and the mean lattice constants (cid:104)a1(cid:105),
(cid:104)a2(cid:105) . (cid:104)E(cid:105) was obtained from NPT Carr-Parrinello molec-
ular dynamics (MD) runs (on a ﬁxed number of particles,
at ambient pressure, and at ﬁnite temperature), as imple-
mented in the SIESTA DFT code [16–18]. Calculations
proceeded on 8×8 supercells for about 1000 fs (and with
a 1.0 fs time resolution) and employed standard basis sets
[19], pseudopotentials with van der Waals corrections of
the Berland-Per Hyldgaard type [20, 21], a k-point grid
including the Γ−point, and a mesh cutoﬀ of 150 Ry. (cid:104)a1(cid:105)

and (cid:104)a2(cid:105) are averaged from over 128,000 (256,000) indi-
vidual values from ML (BL) runs.
The peak in the speciﬁc heat when (cid:104)a1(cid:105) = (cid:104)a2(cid:105) deﬁnes
the critical temperature Tc, and it is sharper in MLs than
in BLs, implying the existence of an interplay between
interlayer coupling and intra-layer disorder in the latter.
The vertical solid lines on ML subplots indicate magni-
tudes of Tc close to 425 K for a GeSe ML and 200 K for
the SnSe ML, that match predicted values [9] reasonably
well [22]. According to Fig. 1, the temperature at which
(cid:104)a1(cid:105) = (cid:104)a2(cid:105) is equal to 450 K for GeSe BLs and 375 K
for SnSe BLs. Together with the larger value of Tc for
bulk SnSe [12–14], the results in Fig. 1 indicate that Tc
can be tuned by the number of layers.
The inset in the SnSe ML ∆(cid:104)E(cid:105)/∆T subplot shows
the hallmark of the transition: a reassignment of nearest
neighboring atoms –shown by thick dashed lines across
the ridges– that induces in-plane strain, leading onto the
2D structure in which (cid:104)a1(cid:105) and (cid:104)a2(cid:105) are identical: The
square unit cell –corresponding to a point of unstable
equilibrium at 0 K [9]– becomes the preferred structure
at Tc, on average.

GeSe and SnSe MLs (where (cid:104)ai(cid:105) =(cid:82) ρ(a(cid:48)

The behavior of the ﬂuctuations about the mean val-
ues of a1 and a2 in Fig. 1 led us to study the nature
of the phase transition. The probability distribution
ρ(a1, a2) on Fig. 2 obtained at various temperatures for
1da(cid:48)
2,
and i = 1, 2) is inconsistent with a displacive transition
where individual atomic displacements correlate up to
mesoscopic distances.
Indeed, at low temperatures a1
and a2 cluster towards their values at 0 K because bond
recommitment is not thermally allowed. Excursions of a1

Due to the order-disorder nature of the transition, the
electronic properties were determined from six individual
8× 8 supercell structures extracted from the MD runs at
500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 fs, which provide an
even sampling [9]. We focused on structures in thermal
equilibrium at 25, 100, 200, 300 and 425 K.

A deformation potential UD [23, 24] is induced as a re-
sult of the structural evolution. We estimated it from the
atomistic ﬂuctuations of the deepest electronic level [25]
at ﬁnite temperature El(T ); a state with largest contribu-
tion from Se 4s orbitals located at about El(0) = −17.50
eV for the GeSe MLs and BLs, and near −16.74 eV
for SnSe MLs and BLs at 0 K. The energy location of
El(T ) decreases with T , and UD(T ) in Table I is equal to
El(T ) − El(0) (standard deviations are driven by atom-
istic ﬂuctuations).

There are no electronic states within the nominal
bandgap despite of the two-dimensional disorder dis-
cussed so far. This assertion is demonstrated in the
leftmost side of columns (i) to (iv) in Fig. 3 from the
electronic density of states (DOS) obtained from six 8×8
supercells evenly distributed in time at any given tem-
perature, with a 10× 10 in-plane k-point grid in order to
reach a ﬁne energy resolution.

(b) SnSe BLs and MLs. Tc is reached when (cid:104)a1(cid:105) = (cid:104)a2(cid:105), and
it is captured by sharp peaks on monolayer (ML) ∆(cid:104)E(cid:105)/∆T
subplots highlighted by solid vertical lines. ∆(cid:104)E(cid:105)/∆T was
scaled by 2 on ML subplots for a direct comparison with BL
data (hence the ×0.5 labels). The average distance among
layers (cid:104)d(cid:105) for BLs is shown in insets with non-scaled error bars.
A structural model showing nearest neighbors is displayed as
an inset. (Error bars on (cid:104)a1(cid:105) and (cid:104)a2(cid:105) were scaled by 1/6 to
make the vertical scale ﬁt within a 0.3 ˚A vertical range.)

and a2 towards the right of the a1 = a2 line begin to have
a ﬁnite probability with increasing temperature though,
and a1 and a2 have a rather homogeneous distribution
at Tc, as seen at the uppermost subplots in Figs. 2(a)
and 2(b). A displacive transition would be realized if the
yellow spots on the distribution at 25 K in Fig. 2 moved
towards the values of (cid:104)a1(cid:105) = (cid:104)a2(cid:105) with minimal scatter
as Tc is approached from below, so Fig. 2 demonstrates
the order-disorder character of the 2D phase transition
occurring in these materials conclusively.

We will now show that temperature induces a defor-
mation potential, reduces the magnitude of the electronic
bandgap without pinning localized states, and reduces
the magnitude of the spin polarization induced by spin-
orbit-coupling. We will also showcase the linear polariza-
tion of the optical absorption band edge and the magni-
tude of the electric dipole of these binary compounds as
additional ﬁngerprints of the transition.

FIG. 3. (Color online.) Electronic DOS and band structures at 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 fs for (i) GeSe BL, (ii) GeSe
ML, (iii) SnSe BL, and (iv) SnSe ML at (a) 25 K, (b) 200 K, and (c) 425 K. The DOS and band structures become broader
with increasing T , but no in-gap states are seen in the DOS nor the band structures despite of disorder. Subplots with a white
(yellow) background were obtained on structures below (at or above) the magnitude of Tc ((cid:104)a1(cid:105) (cid:39) (cid:104)a2(cid:105)) on ML samples. Band
structures show a tendency for the X− and Y −points to become equivalent. The zero energy, EF , was set at the mid-gap.

The bandgap is reported in Table II, where a reduction
of about 75 to 150 meV at Tc with respect to its magni-
tude at 0 K is inferred. The DOS shows two additional
features: (i) sharp peaks in the DOS at 25 K –indicated
by diagonal arrows– that become blurred with increas-
ing temperature, and (ii) a shallow DOS pocket around
the valence-band maximum that is emphasized by gray
rectangles extending onto band structure subplots.

Band structures in Fig. 3 that complement and provide
further support to the information provided by DOS plots
were obtained along the Y −Γ−X high-symmetry path in
two diﬀerent ways: (i) from unit cells built from average
lattice and basis vectors extracted at a given time-frame
from the supercells employed to compute the DOS and
without additional optimization of the basis vectors, and
(ii) from an unfolding scheme [26, 27] developed for DFT
calculations based on numerical atomic orbitals [28, 29].
The sharp peaks on the DOS at 25 K correspond to rela-
tively ﬂat bands located around the Γ−point, whose en-
ergy location ﬂuctuates with increasing temperature and
makes DOS peaks shallower.

2D materials with reduced structural symmetries orig-
inate a novel paradigm in valleytronics in which crystal
momentum labels individual valleys one-to-one [30]:
in
the case of monochalcogenides, the shallow DOS pocket
at 25 K ((cid:104)a1(cid:105) > (cid:104)a2(cid:105)) corresponds with a hole-valley lo-

ergy when contrasted to the hole-valley at the Γ− Y line.
As shown thus far, MLs and BLs increase their structural
symmetry as Tc is approached from below (Fig. 1), mak-
ing the Y − and X−points equivalent (Fig. 3). This is
emphasized by the diminishing height of the (dark) gray
rectangles that collapse onto a line at T ≥ Tc.

So far, we have studied electronic properties with
the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) turned oﬀ. We show in
Fig. 4(a) the spin texture at ﬁnite temperature once the
SOC is included [31]. Explicit calculations show the spin
pointing along the z-direction. In addition, time-reversal
symmetry implies a reversal of spin orientations on the
other two valleys (located along the Γ to −X and Γ to −Y
lines). The enhancement of symmetry at Tc discussed in
Fig. 3 continues to be evident at the valleys, and as shown
in Fig. 4(b), the spin-polarization becomes drastically de-

have twice-as-many bands at these energies, making for
an even more drastic loss of spin polarization.) We con-
tinue to present results with the SOC turned oﬀ in the
remainder of this Letter.

The mobility µi,d (i =electron or hole, d = direction

masses were determined from the bands in Fig. 3.

There is a rather small asymmetry in the mobilities
along orthogonal directions that lie within error bars.
For that reason, we report in Table III its mean mag-
nitude ¯µ over electron and hole valleys, and over the two
orthogonal directions as a function of T . While ¯µ be-
comes smaller with increasing T in the usual manner [34],

the conductance at the valence-band maxima will show a
two-fold increase at Tc as the two hole valleys along the
Γ − Y and Γ − X directions align in energy (Fig. 3).

The linearly polarized optical absorption edge discov-
ered in Ref. [1] is key in addressing individual valleys [5].
In Fig. 5(a) we display the average absorption over twelve
average unit cells at a given temperature, and establish
a vanishing linear polarization of light at the absorption
edge Tc, that is due to the average increase in symme-
try (Fig. 1) that makes the hole valleys along orthogonal
directions align in energy (Fig. 3).

The binary composition of these materials, and the
inversion-asymmetric orientation of individual atoms at
the unit cell creates an electric dipole in MLs that is
oriented parallel to the longest lattice vector (a1) [3],
resulting in a colossal piezoelectric response at 0 K [6, 35].
But crystalline order is lost at the 2D order-disorder
transition [9], making the orientation of these dipoles ran-
dom at Tc and the net magnitude of the electric dipole
moment equal to zero. This hypothesis is demonstrated
in Fig. 5(b) by computing the mean dipole [36] over
twelve average unit cells at a given temperature and with-
out any additional optimization of the basis vectors. This
was accomplished by feeding the instantaneous structural
averages into the VASP code [37] with PBE PAW pseu-
dopotentials [38–40]. In working with instantaneous av-
eraged unit cells, we trade a spatial inhomogeneity by a
temporal one. And as Tc is approached, the relative ori-
entation of the instantaneous average orientation among
the atoms in the unit cell ﬂuctuates, and with it the
orientation of the dipole moment. The total moment –
obtained as an average over 12 individual instantaneous

To conclude, GeSe and SnSe MLs and BLs undergo a
