Abstract

Critical properties of an Ising bilayer system, consisting of two triangular planes with antifer-

romagnetic (AF) JA and ferromagnetic (FM) JB exchange interactions, coupled by the interlayer

exchange JAB, are studied by Monte Carlo simulation. The FM plane is found to induce in the

AF one some eﬀects similar to those resulting from the joint presence of a next-nearest-neighbor

FM coupling and an external magnetic ﬁeld in the single triangular lattice Ising antiferromagnet.

The similarities include the appearance of the quasi-long-range-order BKT phase with algebraically

decaying correlations for smaller JAB, as well as the phase transitions belonging to the three-state

Potts universality class for larger JAB. On the other hand, no ﬁrst-order phase transitions are

observed. A new phenomenon is a cross-over from the BKT to the Wannier state at higher tem-

peratures, that can be stabilized over a relatively wide temperature range. In the strong JAB limit,

the critical behavior of the entire bilayer is governed by the behavior of the plane with a domi-

nant intraplane interaction. If JA is dominant, then the strong JAB coupling makes the system

kinetically freeze at lower temperatures.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetism of bilayers and multilayers is a rapidly developing research ﬁeld mainly due

to the fact that they show novel magnetic properties diﬀerent from those of bulk materials

as well as due to advances in their characterization and preparation at atomic scale1–3. This

can lead to useful technological applications such as high density magnetic recording and

magnetic sensors4. One of the main theoretical interests lies in the possibility to study the

cross-over phenomena between the two- and three-dimensional systems5,6.

A number of studies focused on magnetic properties of simple Ising bilayers formed by

two ferromagnetic layers coupled by an exchange interaction of varying strength7–16. Such

bilayers have been shown to undergo phase transitions that belong to the same universal-

ity class as a two-dimensional Ising model and their critical temperature is controlled by

the so-called shift exponent that depends on the interlayer to intralayer coupling ratio. If

the underlying lattice is bipartite and there are no competing further-neighbor interactions

the sign of the respective exchange interactions is irrelevant in the absence of an external

magnetic ﬁeld.

However, the sign of the interactions matters in the case of a bilayer on a nonbipartite,

such as triangular, lattice. It is well known that, in contrast to its ferromagnetic counterpart,

a two-dimensional triangular lattice Ising antiferromagnet (TLIA) shows no long-range order

(LRO) phase down to zero temperature due to high geometrical frustration17. On the other

hand, a three-dimensional system obtained by stacking of individual TLIA planes on top of

each other has been conﬁrmed to display LRO also at ﬁnite temperatures18–20. Recently,

interesting cross-over phenomena have been observed in a layered system obtained by gradual

stacking of a ﬁnite number of TLIA planes, that lead to a new scenario for ﬂuctuation-

induced ordering in frustrated spin systems21.

The above ﬁndings motivated the present study, in which we consider an Ising bilayer

system consisting of one antiferromagnetic (AF) and one ferromagnetic (FM) triangular

planes, coupled by the FM interlayer exchange interaction. As discussed above, the critical

behavior of the individual planes is very diﬀerent. While the FM one displays a single

standard Ising universality class phase transition to the FM LRO phase, the AF one shows

no LRO down to zero temperature due to high geometrical frustration. The study of such

a bilayer system with all the exchange interactions having uniform magnitudes pointed to

2

the existence of two LRO phases in the AF plane, induced by an eﬀective ﬁeld coming from

the FM plane22.

In the present study we demonstrate that the competing ordering and

disordering tendencies enforced by the respective planes40 in the AF/FM bilayer result in a

rather intricate critical behavior in the exchange interaction parameter space.

II. MODEL AND SIMULATION DETAILS

The model Hamiltonian of the studied bilayer system takes the form

H = −JA Xhi∈A,j∈Ai

σiσj − JB Xhk∈B,l∈Bi

σkσl − JAB Xhi∈A,k∈Bi

σiσk,

(1)

where σi = ±1 is an Ising spin on the ith lattice site, the ﬁrst two sums run over nearest
neighbors (NN) within A and B planes, coupled by the antiferromagnetic JA < 0 and

ferromagnetic JB > 0 exchange interactions, respectively, and the third sum runs over NN

between the planes A and B, coupled by the ferromagnetic interaction JAB > 0.

The model is studied by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations following the Metropolis dynam-
ics. We consider spin systems of the sizes L × L × 2, with L = 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120, and
periodic (open) boundary conditions within (out of) the planes. Temperature dependencies

of various thermodynamic quantities are obtained using standard MC simulation in which

for thermal averaging we typically consider N = 105 Monte Carlo sweeps (MCS) after dis-
carding another N0 = 2 × 104 MCS necessary for thermalization (burn-in period). In order
to shorten the thermalization period and keep the system close to the equilibrium in the

entire temperature range we apply the following procedure. We start from high tempera-

tures (paramagnetic region) with random initialization and gradually decrease them with a

small step (typically ∆T = 0.05 or 0.02, measured in units of the Boltzmann constant kB).

The simulation at the next temperature starts from the ﬁnal conﬁguration obtained at the

previous temperature.

In order to obtain the critical exponents, we perform a ﬁnite-size scaling (FSS) analysis,

in which case we apply the reweighting techniques23. Then we use N = 107 and N0 =
2× 106 MCS, and to reduce autocorrelation in the time series the FSS analysis is performed
on the thinned data using only every 10-th sample. We note that the autocorrelation is

particularly enhanced at the low-temperature phase transition in the frustrated AF layer

and thus relatively long simulation times are necessary to obtain a reliable output. We

made sure that the number of MCS used in the FSS analysis is suﬃcient by assessing the

integrated autocorrelation time τint,mo, corresponding to the order parameter mo of the AF

plane (see the deﬁnition below). As shown in Fig. 1, for the largest lattice sizes it is of the
order of 102 MCS and it follows the scaling law τint,mo ∝ Lz with the estimated dynamic
critical exponent z ≈ 2.3.

Furthermore, approaching frustrated spin systems by conventional MC simulations in

many instances turned out problematic due to extremely slow relaxation resulting from

suppressed tunneling through barriers in multimodal energy landscapes. This problem can

be eliminated by applying the parallel tempering (PT) or replica exchange method24, which

overcomes energy barriers by a random walk in temperature space and allows exploration

of complex energy landscapes. Therefore, when in doubt, we try to verify the reliability

of the obtained results by supplementing them with those from PT. In the latter, we use
N = 5 × 105 MCS and replica swaps at neighboring temperatures are proposed after each
sweep. For reliable estimation of statistical errors, we use the Γ-method25.

We evaluate the following quantities, where h· · ·i denotes thermal averaging. The internal

(10)

The above quantities (5-9) are useful for localization of the phase transitions and determi-

nation of their nature. In particular, L-dependent pseudo-transition temperatures Tc(L) can

be roughly determined from extrema of the quantities (5-8). In the case of the second-order

5

phase transition, extrema of the above thermodynamic functions at the pseudo-transition

temperatures are known to scale with a lattice size as, for example:

or

cmax(L) ∝ Lα/ν (for α 6= 0)

cmax(L) = c0 + c1 ln(L) (for α = 0),

dmx,max(L) ∝ L(1−βx)/νx,

χx,max(L) ∝ Lγx/νx,
dlmx,max(L) ∝ L1/νx.

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

From the above ﬁnite-size scaling (FSS) relations one can estimate the respective critical

exponents α, β, γ and ν, and thus determine the corresponding universality class.

Naturally, the above FSS relations are not applicable in the case of the TLIA model, as it

shows no LRO down to zero temperature. Nevertheless, it is known that in the ground state

it displays quasi-long-range ordering (QLRO) with the spin-correlation function decaying as

a power law27:

hsisji ∝ r−η
ij ,

(16)

where the critical exponent of the correlation function takes the value of η = 1/2. The

power-law decay of the spin-correlation function is also characteristic for the Berezinskii-
Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase28 in the six-state clock model with 1/9 ≤ η ≤ 1/429. The
exponent η can be estimated by FSS of the corresponding order parameter mx, which scales

as

mx(L) ∝ L−ηx/2.

(17)

Owing to perturbations in the form of an eﬀective ﬁeld and further-neighbor coupling

coming from the FM layer, the AF layer may show at low temperatures also the true ferri-

magnetic LRO, similar to the TLIA model in an external magnetic ﬁeld30–33. The ferrimag-

netic LRO and QLRO phases can be distinguished by the quantity C6, which tends to the

value +1 in the former and 0 in the latter case34.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A.

ISOTROPIC INTRAPLANE EXCHANGE

In the following we present the results for the case of the intraplane exchange interactions

having equal strengths and the intraplane to interplane exchange interaction ratio varying
from zero to inﬁnity, i.e., −JA = JB = (1 − JAB) ≡ J, for J ∈ [0, 1]. The ground state
(GS) can be determined by considering the energetics of two coupled elementary triangular
plaquettes in the adjacent planes. It is found that for 0 ≤ J < 1/7 GS is magnetically dis-
ordered “dimer” phase, while within 1/7 < J < 1 both planes display long-range ordering

(LRO). Namely, the FM plane shows ferromagnetic (FM) LRO and the AF plane ferrimag-

netic (FR2) LRO with spins on two sublattices parallel and on one sublattice antiparallel to

the arrangement of the spins in the FM plane.

The above GS scenario is corroborated by temperature variations of the magnetizations

in the respective planes mA and mB, obtained for various J and ﬁxed L = 48, as shown in

Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). For J = 0.1, both mA and mB remain zero at any temperature, whereas
for J ≥ 0.2, they saturate to the zero-temperature values of 1/3 and 1, respectively. At
higher temperatures there is a phase transition in the FM plane from the paramagnetic (P)

to the FM phase at some critical value Tc1. One can notice that the LRO in the FM plane

triggers some degree of FM ordering also in the AF plane, which is reﬂected in a ﬁnite value

of mA and to which we will refer as a ferrimagnetic FR1 phase. Naturally, the degree of

FM ordering in the FR1 phase increases with decreasing J (i.e., increasing the interplane

coupling JAB) and for suﬃciently low J, such as J = 0.2, the net magnetic moment in the AF

plane can exceed that of the FR2 phase, appearing below the second transition temperature

Tc2 < Tc1.

The two phase transitions are also evident from the two sharp peaks in the speciﬁc heat

curves for 1/7 < J < 1, as shown in Fig. 2(c) on a semi-log scale. However, for J = 0.8 and

0.9, one can notice another round peak wedged in between the two sharp ones, the origin

of which will be discussed below. As we are dealing with the system consisting of a fully

frustrated AF subsystem with macroscopically degenerate GS and non-vanishing residual

entropy, and a non-frustrated FM subsystem with a unique GS, it is also interesting to

study how the system entropy changes with a varying parameter J. Inverse temperature

values of J and L = 48. The solid black curves in (c) and (d) show the exact solutions for the

decoupled (J = 0) dimers phase and Tc1, Tc2 in (c) represent two critical temperatures for J = 0.4.

dependencies of the latter, obtained by the thermodynamic integration method, are shown

in Fig. 2(d). For J < 1/7, the entropy density resembles that of the decoupled dimers and

approaches the exact residual value of ln(2)/2 = 0.3466 as T goes to zero. For 1/7 < J < 1,

as the temperature decreases instead of leveling oﬀ one can observe two successive drops at

Tc1 and Tc2 and eventually vanishing at suﬃciently low T . Nevertheless, for some range of

0.75 . J < 1, the entropy decrease is very gentle (see the case of J = 0.9) and its complete

vanishing can be expected only at extremely low temperatures. This behavior is related

to the appearance of the round peaks in the speciﬁc heat curves above , which signal the

8

onset of the QLRO phase in the AF plane (see below). Finally, for J = 1 the residual
entropy acquires again a ﬁnite value of S0/N ≈ 0.161, corresponding to the mean value of
the decoupled planes, i.e., 0 in FM and 0.3231 in AF17 planes.

Let us now study the origin of the peculiar behavior of the speciﬁc heat and the entropy for

0.75 . J < 1. In fact, this behavior can be ascribed to ﬂuctuations occurring solely in the AF

plane, as nothing extraordinary can be observed in the FM plane. Therefore, let us focus on

the corresponding order parameter mo introduced above. In Fig. 3(a) we plot its temperature

dependencies for J = 0.9 and various lattice sizes (empty symbols). Apparently, before

reaching the saturation value in the low-temperature ferrimagnetic FR2 phase, for some

range of intermediate temperatures, mo takes ﬁnite values but slowly vanishes with increasing

L. Such a behavior is typical for a QLRO, such as the BKT phase28. Indeed, by plotting

the parameter C6 in the same ﬁgure (ﬁlled symbols) one can see that it acquires values

close to 1 for T . 0.15 but vanishes at higher temperatures. Assuming the algebraically

decaying correlation function in the QLRO phase (Eq. 16), the corresponding exponent ηo

can be estimated from the FSS expression (17). As shown in Fig. 3(b), the QLRO phase
with ηo ≈ 1/2 is sandwiched between the low-temperature FR2 LRO phase with ηo = 0
and the high-temperature disordered P phase with ηo = 2. Hence, the two low-temperature

speciﬁc heat anomalies observed for J = 0.9 in Fig. 2(c) above manifest transitions between
the respective phases. The value of η ≈ 1/2 in the intermediate temperature phase points
to the highly degenerate Wannier state, as the one observed in the ground state of the TLIA

model27. As the temperature is lowered, the development of an eﬀective interaction lifts up
the Wannier state and we can witness the crossover to the BKT phase with 1/9 ≤ ηo ≤ 1/4
before entering to the FR2 LRO phase.

The respective identiﬁed phases are summarized in the phase diagram, depicted in Fig. 4.

The empty symbols represent approximate values obtained from the speciﬁc heat maxima

at ﬁxed L = 48, the crosses show more precise values obtained from the FSS analysis (see

below) and the ﬁlled downward triangles represent the exact values at T = 0.

The nature of the respective phase transitions can be studied by performing the FSS

analysis. The high-temperature P-FM phase transition in the FM layer is identiﬁed as a

second-order transition belonging to the standard Ising universality class. No signiﬁcant

deviation from the standard behavior is found even in the strong interplane coupling limit,

as shown in Fig. 5(a) for J = 0.2. The corresponding critical temperature is obtained from

the FSS in Fig. 5(b), as Tc1 = 1/βc1 = 0.389(5). Thus, it appears that the coupling of the

FM layer to the frustrated AF layer results in lowering of the transition temperature but

otherwise does not alter its critical properties, as long as the phase transition takes place,

i.e., for 1/7 < J < 1. On the other hand, the universality class of the low-temperature

FR1-FR2 phase transition occurring in the AF layer is clearly diﬀerent from the Ising one.

In Fig. 6(a) we present the FSS results for the respective critical exponents for J = 0.4. In
fact, the estimated values of 1/νo = 1.26(3), αo/νo = 0.43(3), (1 − βo)/νo = 1.11(2) and
γo/νo = 1.82(3) are rather close to the universal values of the three-state ferromagnetic Potts
model35,36, with the exact critical exponent ratios: 1/νP = 1.2, αP /νP = 0.4, (1 − βP )/νP =
1.0¯6 and γP /νP = 1.7¯3. The critical temperature is estimated as Tc2 = 1/βc2 = 0.453(4).

Similar values of the critical exponent ratios as for J = 0.4 are also obtained for other

values of the parameter J, as shown in Fig. 7. Nevertheless, as J approaches larger values

in the vicinity of the QLRO phase the exponents start showing systematic deviation from

the Potts values. Such deviation can be expected since with increasing J we approach the

point at which the critical line of the Potts values splits into two BKT transition lines.

More speciﬁcally, the high-temperature critical line corresponds to the rotational symmetry

breaking line with η = 1/4, and the low-temperature one corresponds to the discretized

B. ANISOTROPIC INTRAPLANE EXCHANGE

Let us now consider the eﬀect of the intraplane exchange anisotropy, i.e., the cases when
|JA| 6= JB, on the phase diagram in Fig. 4. To demonstrate it, we select two values of
J = 0.4 and 0.1, representing respectively the regions with two and no phase transitions

in the isotropic case, and vary the intralayer interaction ratio JA/JB. In practice, we ﬁx
JB = (1 − JAB) ≡ J and change JA.

Let us ﬁrst investigate the case of J = 0.4. The thermal and lattice size41 behaviors

phase transition FR1-FR2 occurs only in the AF plane at some Tc2 < Tc1 and it is observ-

able from the quantities mo, χo and ηo. At Tc2 there is an anomaly also in the sublattice

magnetization mA and the corresponding susceptibility χA diverges, as more clearly seen

in the blow-up of Fig. 8(h) showing the reweighting results. However, the corresponding

critical exponent governing this power-law divergence takes some non-universal value, as

the sublattice magnetization mA is not a proper order parameter for the phase transition in

the AF plane.

Breaking the isotropy by changing the magnitude of the AF interaction JA leaves the

behavior of the quantities at Tc1 practically unchanged. On the other hand, signiﬁcant

changes occur at the low-temperature transition at Tc2.

In particular, by decreasing the

magnitude of JA the transition temperature Tc2 decreases and eventually the ferrimagnetic

FR2 phase vanishes. Thus, in the AF plane the FR1 phase with ﬁnite but unsaturated

0 < mA < 1 spreads down to zero temperature, where the corresponding susceptibility χA
diverges (see Figs. 8(d)-8(f), for JA = −0.1). Further decrease of the magnitude of JA
leads to saturated mA = 1 at low temperatures, i.e., the FM phase also in the AF plane A,

and this transition is accompanied by a broad lattice-size-insensitive maximum in χA (see

On the other hand, if the magnitude of JA is increased, then the rapid decay of the

order parameter mo, observed in the isotropic case, ﬁrst changes to milder (see Fig. 8(j),
for JA = −1.6), which consequently reﬂects to a milder increase of ηo in Fig.8(l), and the
sharp peaks of χo broaden and shift to higher temperatures (Fig.8(k)). The low-temperature

divergent peak of χA transforms to a rounded peak, insensitive to changes of L. At still larger

magnitude of JA the order parameter mo starts showing a shoulder that slowly decreases
with L (see Fig. 8(m), for JA = −4). Furthermore, the susceptibility χo peak splits into
two rounded ones and the area between them becomes divergent (Fig. 8(n)). A plateau of

the height about 1/2, that is formed in the ηo curve for the temperature interval spanning

between the two susceptibility peaks, indicates the presence of the Wannier state in the

AF plane. Notice, that in the lower-temperature part it coexists with the FR1 LRO phase

and then extends to the temperatures exceeding Tc1. Further increase in magnitude of JA

results in gradual extension of the Wannier phase to even higher temperatures (see the ηo
curve for JA = −10 in Fig.8(o)). A better picture of the extent of the Wannier state can
be obtained by plotting the relevant critical exponent ηo versus the normalized temperature

at T /|JA| ≈ 0.4 and with the increasing magnitude of JA extends its width to still lower
values of the reduced temperature.

In Fig. 10 we also present the behavior of the speciﬁc heat for JB = 0.4 and varying JA.

In all the cases, there is a sharp peak at Tc1 related to the P-FM phase transition the FM

plane. At low temperatures, a sharp peak related to the FR1-FR2 phase transition in the
AF plane exists for the isotropic case, i.e., JA = −0.4, but it changes to a round maximum
for all the anisotropic cases. For JA < −0.4, within the range of temperatures with the
Wannier state in the AF plane, the speciﬁc heat is totally dominated by the contribution

from the FM plane and thus the presence of the Wannier state is not apparent from the

speciﬁc heat behavior.

In the case of a weak intralayer and strong interlayer couplings, i.e, the case of J = 0.1, we

consider the situations when the interaction in the AF plane is either considerably weaker
(JA = −0.02) or stronger (JA = −0.5) than that in the FM plane (JB = 0.1).

by the FM plane. As depicted in Fig. 11(a), the FM LRO seems to occur in both FM and

AF planes at the same temperature. It would be interesting to verify whether the small

frustrated AF interactions could somehow aﬀect the standard Ising universality class of the

P-FM phase transition. Unfortunately, the transition occurs at rather low temperatures at

which enormous autocorrelation times prevent a reliable FSS analysis. To demonstrate it,

we show the integrated autocorrelation times of the magnetization mB in the vicinity of
the transition point for diﬀerent L, along with the time evolution of MB/L2, for the largest
L = 120 in Fig. 11(b)42. In this case, even the PT method did not produce desirable results.
On the other hand, in the case that the AF interaction is dominant, i.e., JA = −0.5, the
properties of the FM plane closely follow those possessed by the AF plane. Namely, only

QLRO exists in both planes with zero plane magnetizations mA and mB, and ﬁnite but with

L decaying order parameter mo. Moreover, the strong interlayer coupling leads to sluggish

spin dynamics and eventually freezing at low temperatures, similar to the kinetic freezing

eﬀect observed in the stacked-triangular lattice Ising antiferromagnet32,38. This phenomenon

is reﬂected in practically constant values of the order parameter over some low-temperature

interval, as shown in Fig. 12(a). The same ﬁgure also demonstrates a high degree of the

ground-state degeneracy by showing several MC runs, with diﬀerent initializations, that lead

to diﬀerent states with the same energy of e/J = −0.65 (Fig. 12(b)), consistent with the
exact value determined from the Hamiltonian for the Wannier state. Considering the low-

temperature region, in which frustrated systems simulated by standard methods may fail to

reach equilibrium, we additionally ran the parallel tempering simulation and conﬁrmed the

reliability of the obtained solutions (the ﬁlled symbols in Fig. 12).

IV. DISCUSSION

We studied the critical behavior of an Ising bilayer system consisting of two ferromag-

netically coupled triangular planes with the AF and FM intraplane interactions. Although

the critical properties of the individual planes are well known, we showed that the interplay

of the ordering tendencies enforced by the FM plane and disordering ones in the geometri-

cally frustrated AF plane through the interplane coupling can lead to novel phenomena, not

observed in the separate planes.

Particularly interesting is the critical behavior of the AF layer.

Its coupling to the

adjacent FM plane can be viewed as an eﬀective coupling to the next-nearest neighbors

18

(NNN). At the same time, the FM layer generates an eﬀective uniform ﬁeld to which the

AF layer is exposed. Therefore, the present results can be discussed in the context of the

ﬁndings obtained for the TLIA model with the ferromagnetic NNN exchange interaction in

an external magnetic ﬁeld39. Indeed, the presence of the quasi-long-range-order (QLRO)

phase above the ferrimagnetic FRM2 LRO one, for a relatively weak interlayer coupling,
i.e., |JAB/JA| << 1, is consistent with the situation in the NNN TLIA model at small ﬁelds.
So is the shrinking of the QLRO phase and changing to a single critical point, belonging to
the three-state Potts universality, with the increasing |JAB/JA| in the present model with
the situation when the external ﬁeld is gradually increased in the NNN TLIA model.

On the other hand, there are some diﬀerences between the two models. Perhaps the

most intriguing one is the character of the QLRO phase. While the NNN TLIA model in
the ﬁeld shows the XY-like BKT type of correlations, characterized by 1/9 ≤ η ≤ 1/4, the
present model displays a clear cross-over to the Wannier state with η = 1/2. The latter is

characteristic for the GS of the TLIA model. Nevertheless, in the present bilayer system

it can persist to relatively high temperatures, even well above the high-temperature critical

point Tc1, as for example shown in Figs. 8(o) or 9. Furthermore, in contrast to the ﬁnding

in Ref.39 for the case of equal NN and NNN couplings, we found no signs of ﬁrst-order phase

transitions within the range of our calculations. In the isotropic case, a good candidate area

for such transitions is the part of the low-temperature phase boundary just above the critical

value of J = 1/7. Nevertheless, the FSS results pointed to the second-order phase transitions

in the three-state Potts universality class down to at least J = 0.2 (see Fig.7). Even though

the possibility of the existence of the ﬁrst-order phase transitions within 1/7 < J < 0.2

cannot be ruled out, it is also possible that the eﬀective NNN coupling in this area is still

insuﬃcient to induce them.

In the limiting cases when either the FM or AF intraplane coupling signiﬁcantly prevails

over the other and the planes are strongly coupled together, the critical behavior of the entire

bilayer is governed by the plane with the dominant coupling. Since at low temperatures the

NN spins in the adjacent layers are virtually locked together, the spin dynamics becomes

slowed down and practically frozen well above the ground state. This happens in both cases

but it is particularly conspicuous in the case when the plane with the dominant coupling is

the highly degenerated AF one.

In the present study we considered the AF/FM bilayer, in which the respective layers

19

consisted of single AF and FM planes. Further appealing extension could involve the layers

formed by stacks of a ﬁnite number of the AF and FM planes. It would be interesting to

see how the ordering eﬀects from the FM layer propagate through the AF stack, the nature

of the critical behavior of which itself is additionally controlled by its thickness21.
