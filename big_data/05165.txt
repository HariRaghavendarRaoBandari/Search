Recent progress in manipulating atomic and condensed matter systems has instigated a surge
of interest in non-equilibrium physics, including near-ﬁeld radiative heat transfer and many-body
dynamics in trapped ultracold atoms and ions. Born-Markov and local thermal equilibrium are two
of the most widely used approximations for describing the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems.
The impact of these approximations on dispersion forces, e.g. Casimir-Polder interactions and
quantum friction, has often been largely underestimated. Using general theoretical arguments and
exactly solvable models, we show that these approximations can lead to erroneous predictions of
ﬂuctuation-induced interactions with regard to both strength and functional dependencies on system
parameters.

In recent years the physics of non-equilibrum systems
has attracted a lot of attention from diﬀerent disci-
plines, such as stochastic thermodynamics and many-
body quantum dynamics [1–3]. Non-equilibrium physics
may, in general, elude the constraints imposed by equilib-
rium thermodynamics and open interesting perspectives
and new pathways for applications [4]. Within this gen-
eral framework, the last ﬁve years have witnessed a re-
newed interest in the speciﬁc case of dispersion forces.
Better known for equilibrium phenomena such as the
van der Waals/Casimir-Polder force [5] and the Casimir
eﬀect [6], these interactions play an important role in
several ﬁelds of physics, including atomic [7] and sta-
tistical physics [8], gravitation [9] and cosmology [10].
Non-equilibrium physics enters in the description of these
phenomena when, for example, temperature gradients or
mechanical motion become relevant elements of the sys-
tem. Speciﬁc examples include the near-ﬁeld radiative
heat transfer [11] and Casimir forces between bodies at
diﬀerent temperatures [12, 13] as well as quantum friction
[14, 15].

From the theoretical standpoint one often must rely
on approximations in order to predict the outcome cor-
responding to a speciﬁc setup. For instance, the Born-
Markov approximation and the local thermal equilibrium
(LTE) approximation are two of the most ubiquitous
ones. Rather than referring to single-step approxima-
tions, these designations, in fact, refer to entire proce-
dures. In the Markov case, the key assumption is that
the system’s memory can be ignored, i.e., the future of
its dynamics is only related to the immediate present.
More speciﬁcally, the logic behind this approximation
ﬁnds its justiﬁcation in the fact that sub-systems often
exhibit very diﬀerent correlation times, so that on aver-
age the fastest dynamics blurs the evolution of the slower

sub-system, eﬀectively erasing its memory [16, 17]. The
Markov approximation is one of the most widespread
procedures in quantum optics, and has provided reli-
able predictions for numerous experimental setups. On
the other hand, within the LTE approximation diﬀerent
sub-systems are treated as if they were in local thermal
equilibrium with their immediate surroundings. Within
this approximation, common equilibrium approaches and
tools such as the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT)
[18], can be locally applied. These local results are then
combined to describe the non-equilibrium dynamics of
the full system. This procedure is reminiscent of per-
turbation theory where, when the coupling between sub-
systems is suﬃciently small, information from the non-
interacting (free) sub-systems (zeroth order) can be used
to make predictions about the dynamics of the full sys-
tem, resulting from their interaction. The usual justiﬁ-
cation for the LTE approximation is that the system’s
correlation length often is rather short (the dynamics in
suﬃciently well-separated locations are incoherent and
can be treated as being independent [19]), and the sub-
systems locally relax to equilibrium on a fast time-scale.

In this work, we show that these two widely used ap-
proximations can fail in providing reliable predictions for
non-equilibrium ﬂuctuation-induced interactions. Sur-
prisingly, depending on the targeted level of accuracy, the
Markov approximation can already lead to incorrect re-
sults for systems in equilibrium. Its failure becomes, how-
ever, more relevant as soon as non-equilibrium systems
are being considered. Although in some circumstances
non-Markovian eﬀects are already known for strongly
aﬀecting the dynamics of quantum systems (e.g. non-
exponential decay of excited quantum states for atoms
in photonic crystals [20–22]), their impact on ﬂuctuation-
induced phenomena is often underestimated. Moreover,

the role and relevance of non-Markovian eﬀects in con-
junction with non-equilibrium physics, has yet to be thor-
oughly investigated. Our discussion focuses on the proto-
typical system consisting of a single atom (or, in general,
a microscopic system with internal degrees of freedom)
interacting with a planar surface (see Figs. 1 and 4).
Besides the large interest of modern experiments in such
setups [23], e.g., in thermal radiation and hybrid atom-
chip systems, they lend themselves to advanced but still
not too complex theoretical treatments.

The manuscript is structured into three main sections.
In Section I, we review the theory of equilibrium atom-
surface interactions and derive the expression for the
Casimir-Polder force. The purpose of this part is twofold:
On the one hand, it allows for an exposition of the for-
malism and the basic concepts which will be used in
the non-equilibrium case. On the other hand, our ap-
proach allows for considerations beyond standard pertur-
bative techniques [23, 24] and the usual Lifshitz theory of
equilibrium phenomena [8]. In particular, we show that
long-time tails in the two-time dipole correlation (and its
corresponding low-frequency behavior) arising from non-
Markovian eﬀects become relevant as soon as one goes
beyond second-order perturbation theory (see Fig. 3).
Since Casimir interactions are a broad-band frequency
phenomenon, a precise description of the the behavior at
low frequencies is fundamental for the evaluation of the
interaction. Our ﬁnal result will formally take into ac-
count the general response of the atomic system, and the
standard Lifshitz formula is obtained as a special case in
the linear approximation.

Sections II and III focus on quantum friction. Like
ordinary friction, quantum friction describes a force act-
ing on an object moving near another one (see Fig. 4).
Unlike the classical case, however, quantum friction is
mediated by the interaction with the quantum electro-
magnetic ﬁeld at zero temperature, T = 0. In Section
II we argue that, as in the static case, non-Markovian
eﬀects aﬀecting the low-frequency behavior of the dipole
correlator are crucial for the correct evaluation of this
drag force (see Eq. (30) below). In fact, these eﬀects are
responsible for the velocity-dependence of the frictional
force. As we shall demonstrate in this work, it is pre-
cisely this sensitivity of quantum friction to the Markov
approximation that explains the vast zoology of very dif-
ferent results found in the literature, e.g. [15, 25–28].

Finally, in Section III we discuss the breakdown of the
local thermal equilibrium approximation. We show that
although the LTE+FDT approach successfully predicts
the correct dependence on velocity and distance from the
surface, it fails in providing the correct strength. To as-
sess more precisely the impact of non-equilibrium physics
on quantum friction, we consider an exactly solvable
model based on a moving harmonic oscillator [29, 30].
We derive a generalized non-equilibrium FDT which is
valid in non-equilibrium steady states (Eq. (48) below).
Speciﬁcally, we show that the magnitude of the force pre-
dicted by our non-equilibrium approach is almost twice

I. NON-MARKOVIAN EFFECTS WITHIN THE

CASIMIR-POLDER INTERACTION

Let us start by considering the familiar Casimir-Polder
interaction between an atom located at position ra above
a semi-inﬁnite planar medium (see Fig. 1). Within the
open quantum system framework, the resulting dissipa-
tion can be thought of as stemming from the interaction
of the matter’s degrees of freedom with a dissipative bath
[31–34]. In our description, the atom is represented by
the dipole operator ˆd(t). For symmetry reasons, the force
acting on the atom has only a single component along the
direction normal to the planar interface (which we denote
as the z-direction). At any given time t, it is given by

FCP(t) = (cid:104)ˆd(t) · ∂za

ˆE(ra, t)(cid:105),

(1)

where ˆE(r, t) is the electric ﬁeld operator, ra is the po-
sition of the atom, and the expectation value is taken
over the initial state of the system. This expression for
the atom-surface force can be derived from the Lorentz
force on the atom after neglecting the magnetic contribu-
tion [24]. It is important to stress that the time depen-
dence of the operators in Eq.(1) is the full time evolution
dictated by the total system and, therefore, it includes
the eﬀect of the interactions between the diﬀerent sub-
systems (atom, ﬁeld, and matter). Using the Maxwell
equations, the electric ﬁeld operator can be written as
ˆE(r, t) = ˆE(+)(r, t) + h.c., where

with ti being some initial time. Here, ˆE(+)
is the positive-
frequency part (related to the annihilation operators) of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the absence of the atom but
in the presence of the dissipative medium, and G(r, r(cid:48), ω)
is the Green tensor of the half-space associated with the
surface. To derive equation (2) we used the Kramers-
Kronig relations for the Green tensor (see Appendix A).

spectively, indicate the imaginary and the real part of a
quantity (component-wise for tensorial objects). Because
the dipole and the ﬁeld (positive- and negative-frequency
parts separately) operators commute at equal times, by
normal ordering we can write

which plays a key role in what follows. The coupled
equations of motion for the atom and ﬁeld/matter can
be solved (e.g. numerically or using the Born-Markov
approximation [24]) to obtain the dynamic evolution of
the two-time dipole correlator and the time-dependent
atom-surface force.

The ﬁnal result cannot depend on the ordering we choose,
as long as this ordering is consistently used throughout
the entire derivation. However, as will appear in the fol-
lowing, this speciﬁc choice of ordering is convenient for
our calculations. Physically it has the implication of at-
tributing the force exclusively to the radiation reaction
in the atom dynamics [35], while the contribution of the
vacuum ﬁeld related to the operator ˆE0 seemingly disap-
pears. However, this does not mean that the quantum
properties ˆE0 are irrelevant: In this approach they are
“hidden” in the expression for the time-dependent dipole
operator and they will explicitly appear again when we
consider, for example, dipole correlation functions. For
other choices, such as symmetric ordering [36], both the
dipole and the ﬁeld itself contribute to the force and the
term containing ˆE0 must consistently be kept throughout
the calculation.

initial density matrix and ˆρf/m(ti) represents the state
of the coupled ﬁeld/matter system. Both subsystems
are assumed to be initially in their respective ground
states, which implies that (cid:104)ˆd(t)·∂za
(ra, t)(cid:105) = tr[ˆd(t)·
∂za
(ra, t)ˆρ(ti)] = 0 for all times (here, the sym-
bol “tr” traces over the quantum states). This means
that the contribution coming from the vacuum state of
ﬁeld/medium subsystem drops out of the calculation.
Note that, although both subsystems are initially in their
respective ground states, in general, the state ˆρ(ti) is not
the ground state of the composite system [37, 38]. Dur-
ing the course of the time-evolution, the atom subsystem
becomes entangled with the ﬁeld/matter subsystem, un-
dergoing the well-known “dressing” process [39].

metry properties of the Green tensor, Gij(r, r(cid:48), ω) =
Gji(r(cid:48), r, ω), we can rewrite the atom-surface force as

ordered) two-time dipole correlator,

Cij(t, t − τ ) = (cid:104) ˆdi(t) ˆdj(t − τ )(cid:105),

(5)

A natural question that arises

is whether non-
Markovian eﬀects are relevant in the dynamics of the
dipole correlator and, consequently, in the force FCP(t).
In order to address this question, we will consider the
limit of large times in which the entire system of atom
plus ﬁeld/matter equilibrates and becomes stationary. In
this case, the correlator depends only on the time diﬀer-
ence τ , i.e., Cij(τ ) = tr[ ˆdi(τ ) ˆdj(0)ˆρ(∞)], where ˆρ(∞)
represents the stationary density matrix of the full sys-
tem. In this limit the atom-surface force reaches the con-
stant value FCP ≡ limt→∞ FCP(t), which should coincide
with the expression of the well-known Casimir-Polder in-
teraction [5]. In order to evaluate Eq.(4) for large times,
it is convenient to introduce the dipole power spectrum
tensor S(ω), which is deﬁned in terms of the correlator
as

As C†(τ ) = C(−τ ), the power spectrum is Hermitian
S†(ω) = S(ω) and its real part SR(ω) is a symmetric
matrix, while its imaginary part SI (ω) is anti-symmetric.
Using these properties, the stationary Casimir-Polder
force can be written as

As we will show below, depending on the approach
and the approximations used to compute this stationary
dipole-dipole power specturm, one obtains diﬀerent ex-
pressions for the stationary interaction.

A. Using the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem

At large times one can invoke equilibrium considera-
tions to determine the stationary density matrix. We will
assume that the full system thermally equilibrates at an
inverse temperature β, and that the stationary state is
given by a Gibbs state ˆρ(∞) (cid:39) e−β ˆH where ˆH describes
the Hamiltonian of the full system [17, 40–42], includ-
ing the couplings between all sub-systems. In these cir-
cumstances, we can appeal to the ﬂuctuation-dissipation

theorem (FDT) [18]. This theorem of equilibrium ther-
modynamics establishes a connection between the power
spectrum and the linear response of the system to an
small external perturbation. In particular, we will con-
sider the case of zero temperature (T = 0), for which the
Gibbs state is the highly entangled ground state of the
full system In this case, for a non-symmetrized correlator,
the FDT takes the form [41]


I (ω) − iαas

where θ(ω) denotes the Heaviside function, and α(cid:61)(ω) =
[α(ω) − α†(ω)]/(2i) = αs
R (ω) (the superscripts
“s” and “as” indicate the symmetric and the anti-
symmetric part of the tensor). Further, α(ω) represents
the atom’s complex susceptibility (polarizability) tensor,
i.e. the Fourier transform of Kubo’s formula in the case
of linear response, i.e.,

θ(ω)α(cid:61)(ω),

S(ω) =

As any susceptibility (including the Green tensor), α(ω)
is analytic in the upper part of the complex ω-plane and
satisﬁes the crossing relation α(−ω∗) = α∗(ω). It follows
that the real (imaginary) part of the polarizability is an
even (odd) function of frequency. Using these properties
in combination with the FDT and the Kramers-Kronig
relations, we may rewrite Eq.(7) as [43]

FCP =

(10)
Here, we used that the poles of α(ω, r) and G(r, r(cid:48), ω)
must be located in the lower half of the complex ω plane,
and we have expressed the ﬁnal result as an integral along
the positive imaginary-frequency axis (Wick rotation).
In the above expression, we have explicitly indicated the
position dependence of the atom’s polarizability to stress
that the dressing is depending on the system’s geometry.
Although it is redundant because of the properties of the
Green tensor, we have also used the superscript “s” to
emphasize that only the symmetric part of the polariz-
ability is relevant for the ﬁnal result.

As a ﬁnal remark of this subsection, we want to em-
phasize that, despite certain formal similarities, Eq.(10)
diﬀers from standard formulas found in the literature for
the atom-surface interaction.
Indeed, Eq.(10) contains
the exact atomic polarizability, while standard expres-
sions are special cases of this formula, e.g. the Lifshitz
formula for linear systems [8], and perturbative expan-
sions in the atom-ﬁeld coupling strength [5, 43, 44]. For
further details, see Appendix B.

the quantum extension of Onsager’s regression conjecture
[47, 48], the QRT ﬁnds its justiﬁcation within the frame-
work of master equations. Using the Born approximation
(which entails the factorization of the density matrix at
any time, i.e., no back-action of the system onto the en-
vironment) and the Markov approximation (no memory
eﬀects), it is possible to show that the regression of ﬂuc-
tuations is identical to the decay of a one-time average
[45]. Although the QRT provides expressions for corre-
lators that are more explicit than those in the FDT, the
approximations on which it relies limit its validity to the
limit of weak atom-ﬁeld coupling and to a narrow range
of frequencies close to a resonance [49–53].

To show how this aﬀects the Casimir-Polder interac-
tion, we now evaluate the two-time dipole correlation
tensor introduced at the beginning of this section using
the QRT approach. Let us model the atom as a multi-
level system, and consider the operators ˆAmn = |m(cid:105)(cid:104)n|
that describe the transition from the atomic level |n(cid:105)
to |m(cid:105). We write the dipole operator as ˆd(t) = dˆq(t),
where d denotes the (real) dipole vector and ˆq(t) is a
dimensionless operator describing the quantum dynam-
ics of the internal degrees of freedom. For this operator
nm cnm ˆAmn(t), where cnm are the ma-
trix elements corresponding to the transition described
by ˆAmn. According to the QRT, the two-time correlator
(cid:104)Anm(t)Am(cid:48)n(cid:48)(t(cid:48))(cid:105) is given by [17, 24, 46] (t > t(cid:48))

we have ˆq(t) =(cid:80)

(cid:104)Amn(t)Am(cid:48)n(cid:48)(t(cid:48))(cid:105) = δnm(cid:48)(cid:104)Amn(cid:48)(t(cid:48))(cid:105)

× e[i˜ωmn(ra)−γmn(ra)](t−t(cid:48)),

(11)

where ˜ωmn(ra) and γmn(ra) > 0 respectively represent
the position-dependent, ﬁeld-renormalized transition fre-
quencies and decay rates corresponding to the n → m
transitions. In the usual master equation framework it
is expected that, in the absence of any external driving
force and at large times, the reduced density matrix of the
atom should relax to ˆρa(∞) (cid:39) e−β ˆHa [17, 24], where ˆHa
is the Hamiltonian of the atom subsystem (note that this
state is diﬀerent from the one used in the FDT above). In
particular, at zero temperature this reduced density ma-
trix should relax to the atomic ground state [54]. There-
fore, (cid:104)Amn(∞)(cid:105) = δm0δn0 and limt→∞(cid:104)Amn(t)Am(cid:48)n(cid:48)(t −
τ )(cid:105) = δnm(cid:48)δm0δn(cid:48)0 exp([i˜ω0n(ra)− γ0n(ra)]τ ) [24], featur-
ing an exponential decay of correlations. In the simple
case of a two-level system, the stationary dipole correla-
tor is then given by [17, 24, 46] (τ > 0)

Cij(τ ) = didj e[−i˜ωa(ra)−γa(ra)]τ ,

(12)

where ˜ωa = ˜ω10 and γa = γ01. This implies that the
stationary limit of Eq. (4) is given by

regarded as a generalization to higher orders or per-
turbation theory of the corresponding bare polarizabil-
(the small
imaginary part in the denominator is introduced in order
to enforce causality). Equation (14) was ﬁrst derived in
[24] using the QRT approach.

a − (ω + i0+)2(cid:3)−1

Upon comparing the expression for the Casimir-Polder
force obtained with the QRT, Eq. (14), with that ob-
tained using the FDT, Eq. (10), we note that they only
coincide at the lowest order in perturbation theory, or,
equivalently, when the polarizabilities in both equations
are replaced by the bare polarizability. At higher or-
ders they clearly diﬀer because of the drastically distinct
methods used to calculate the stationary two-point dipole
correlation tensor C(τ ). The ﬁrst and most evident dif-
ference is in the dependence of FCP on the spectral line-
width of the polarizability. Compared to the result in Eq.
(10), with α(ω, ra) ≈ α(2)(ω, ra), the force resulting from
Eq. (14) is less sensitive to the radiative decay rate and
its magnitude slightly deviates from the result obtained
using the bare polarizability. The application of the QRT
results in a force whose magnitude is larger than that
obtained via the FDT, and the diﬀerence is more pro-
nounced for atoms with larger dipole moment (stronger
atom-ﬁeld coupling) [58]. We depict this behavior in Fig
2, where we compare the FDT- and QRT-based predic-
tions using the polarizability in Eq. (15) (for simplicity
we neglected the surface-induced frequency shift).

C. Relation between the FDT and the QRT

The result of the previous two sub-sections demon-
strate that the use of two of the most popular approaches
for calculating quantum correlators leads to diﬀerent re-
sults for the Casimir-Polder force as soon as one consid-
ers orders higher than the leading one. It is important
to emphasize that while the FDT is an exact theorem,
the QRT represents only an approximation.
It has al-
ready been pointed out that, because of the Born-Markov
approximation, the QRT may lead to results that are
incompatible with the statistical mechanics of quantum
systems when treated beyond the weak-coupling approx-
imation or perturbed far away from resonance [49, 50].

FIG. 2.
Non-Markovian correction to the Casimir-Polder
force as a function of the atom-surface separation. The three
curves correspond to diﬀerent values of the atom-ﬁeld cou-
pling: The lower (purple) curve refers to 87Rb (static po-
larizability α0 = 2|d|2 /3ωa = 5.26 × 10−39Fm2 [59]); the
middle (red) curve corresponds to a hypothetical two-level
a /ωa = 10−6, where ωa is the
system with free decay rate, γfree
transition frequency of 87Rb; the upper (green) curve is the
result for γfree
a /ωa = 1/3, typical of fullerene (C60, see Ref.
[58]). For simplicity, all three cases have the same value for
the transition frequency. The oscillations visible at large sep-
arations are associated with the oscillations of the decay rates
for distances zaλa (cid:38) 1. The planar surface is modeled as a
metallic half-space whose constituent material is described by
the Drude model (ω) = 1− ω2
p[ω(ω + iΓ)]−1 with parameters
that are typical for gold: ωp = 9 eV and Γ/ωp = 5 × 10−3.
The distance is measured in units of the plasma wavelength
λp = 2πc/ωp (∼ 140 nm).

The quantum-regression “theorem” has proven to be re-
markably successful for driven quantum optical systems,
and it is precisely its narrow-width feature that makes
it so powerful [51–53]. However, because of the broad-
band nature of electromagnetic ﬂuctuation-induced in-
teractions, this same feature makes the QRT in general
inadequate to treat such interactions. In particular, an
inappropriate description of any part of the spectrum can
lead to erroneous results. It is well known that the ex-
ponential decaying behavior is incorrect at large times,
and is replaced by algebraic tails [60, 61]. Consequently,
when one goes from the time to the frequency domain,
the corresponding Fourier transform becomes inprecise
at low frequencies. A similar argument applies to high
frequencies, since it is also known that for short times
the decay process starts quadratically in τ instead of the
linear behavior associated with an exponential law [62].

To further understand how non-Markovian eﬀects are
responsible for the diﬀerence between the two expressions
for the Casimir-Polder force, it is convenient to examine
the two-time correlator C(τ ) in the limit of large times.

for simplicity, we have suppressed the depen-
dence of the polarizability on ra. The second line is ob-
tained by computing the ω integral using a contour in
the lower-right quadrant of the complex frequency plane.
Here, “Res” denotes the residue, and Ωi = Ωi(ra) are
the complex poles of the polarizability. As these poles
are located in the right lower quadrant, we can write
Ωi = ωi(ra) − iγi(ra), where ωi(ra) and γi(ra) are two
non-speciﬁed real and positive functions whose exact ex-
pression depends on the speciﬁc model for the atom (e.g.
for the two-level atom they are given in Eq. (12)). At
this point, we would like to note that, for simplicity, we
have assumed for that no other discontinuity but isolated
poles exist in the complex plane. If this were not the case,
e.g., when branch cuts would be present, they must be
added to Eq.(16). For the present case of simple poles,
we see that the stationary dipole correlation, as given by
the FDT, contains a decaying exponential behavior just
like the QRT (ﬁrst term in Eq.(16)), plus an extra term
which is ultimately responsible for the diﬀerence between
Eqs. (10) and (14). Upon an analytical continuation, one
has

This expression yields the terms that are missing in
Eq.(14) in order to recover Eq.(10) (see Appendix C).
While the exponential terms exp(−iΩiτ ) in Eq.(16) are
sensitive to the details of the polarizability for frequen-
cies around the poles Ωi, the last integral in Eq.(16) when
τ → ∞ is sensitive to the behavior of the polarizability at
low frequencies, |ω| ∼ 0. From the crossing relation, we
can deduce that αs
I (ω) is odd in frequency, which means
I (ω) ≈ a2m+1ω2m+1 (m = 0, 1, 2, . . . ).
that its form is αs
As a result, for times τ for which the exponentialy decay-
ing terms have died out, i.e., when τ (cid:29) 1/min(γi), the
stationary correlation behaves as

The above discussion shows that for large τ the equilib-
rium correlation function predicted by the FDT exhibits
a power-law decay instead of an exponential behavior (as
would result from the QRT (see Eq.(12)). This diﬀer-
ence between the FDT and the QRT is well-known in
other contexts of quantum optics, e.g., the dynamics of
the quantum harmonic oscillator [50] or the spontaneous
decay of an excited atom in the electromagnetic vacuum

FIG. 3. Comparison of the normalized power spectra s(ω) =
S·(dd/π ˜ωa)−1 predicted by the FDT (blue line) and the QRT
(red line) for the polarizability of Eq. (15) (dissipation is set
to γa/˜ωa = 10−2). While the two results are indistinguishable
on resonance, they diﬀer at low and negative frequencies. This
is clearly visible in the inset, which provides a close up around
ω = 0. While the power spectrum given by the FDT vanishes
for ω ≤ 0, that obtained from the QRT is nonzero.

[60, 63–65]. This phenomenon is related to the limita-
tions of the Weisskopf-Wigner approximation, which, in
turn, is equivalent to the Markov approximation [60, 61],
an essential ingredient for the QRT [51, 52]. One of the
ﬁrst consequences of the above considerations is that the
power spectrum obtained from the QRT dipole correla-
tion Eq. (12),

SQRT(ω) =

is incorrect at low frequencies, in particular it does not
vanish for ω ≤ 0 as does the FDT power spectrum (Eqs.
(8) and (15)).
In Fig. 3 we compare SQRT(ω) with
the corresponding FDT power spectrum S(ω). We see
that the largest diﬀerence occurs at low frequency, while
around the resonance value the two expressions overlap.
Notice that the impact of this inaccurate description and
the resulting discrepancies only appear for evaluations at
orders higher than the second, i.e. when radiative damp-
ing induced by the interaction with electromagnetic ﬁeld
occurs.

In the next section, we will discuss the quantum fric-
tional force experienced by an atom ﬂying parallel to the
surface. Since the evaluation of quantum friction requires
a calculation at least to the fourth order in the atom-
ﬁeld coupling, the above discussion about the FDT vs
the QRT will play a relevant role in determining the cor-
rect expression for this force.

QUANTUM FRICTION

In the previous section we have shown how non-
Markovianity impacts the value of the static atom-surface

where

ˆE0(k, za; ω)ei[k·R(t)−ωt] .
(21)
For ω > 0, the function ˆE0(k, za; ω) contains the same
annihilation operators as in the static case. As in the
previous section, by again choosing normal ordering and
taking the average over the same initial state, the contri-
bution of the ﬁeld operator ˆE⊕
0 to the quantum frictional
force vanishes identically [25, 26]. In other words, con-
siderations similar to those made for the static force after
Eq. (3) are also valid for the dynamic case. It does turn
out that the frictional force at time t is given by

properties of the Green tensor (see Appendix A), we can
also deduce that the symmetric part of the Green tensor
is even in k, while the antisymmetric part is odd in k.

I (k, z, ω) − iGas

Owing to the dissipative properties of the system, we
expect that it has a ﬁnite memory time τc, so that the
largest contributions in the τ -integral in Eq. (22) stem
from times τ = t− t(cid:48) (cid:46) τc. In particular, this means that
in the limit of large times t → ∞ which we will consider
below, we are allowed to replace R(t) by Ra + vt, and
R(t− τ ) can be approximated by Ra + v(t− τ ). At large
times, the atom reaches a steady state, and the frictional
force balances the external force, resulting in an atom
that moves with constant velocity v above the surface.
One of the main diﬀerences with respect to the static
case is that now the stationary correlation tensor depends
on the velocity of the atom: C(τ ) = limt→∞(cid:104)ˆd(t)ˆd(t −

static case, owing to the stationarity of the process, the
correlation tensor depends only on the time diﬀerence τ .
It also implicitly depends on the ﬁnal velocity v through
the dynamics of the atom. In the NESS, the frictional
force becomes constant Ffric(t → ∞) = Ffric, and takes
the form

(cid:105) ≡ C(τ ; v). Similar to the

interaction. The relevance of the correction with respect
to the Markovian case quantitatively depends on the level
of accuracy used in describing the atom’s internal dy-
namics, and it appears only when orders higher than the
leading one are considered. In this section we move a step
forward and generalize our analysis to an atom moving
with constant velocity v parallel to a planar surface. Our
goal is to evaluate the impact of non-Markovian eﬀects
on the vacuum-mediated frictional force experienced by
the atom during its motion parallel to the surface. For
simplicity we will consider the case T = 0, i.e. quantum
friction.

A. Derivation of the quantum frictional force

In a semiclassical approximation, the trajectory for the
center of mass of the atom will be prescribed as ra(t),
and its internal degrees of freedom will be modeled as an
electric dipole. For simplicity, we neglect any magnetic
contribution, which is a good approximation as long as
the electric dipole is very near to the surface (near ﬁeld
region) [66]. Assuming that the surface lies in the plane
z = 0 and that the motion takes place at a constant
distance za from the surface (see Fig.4), the equation of
motion for the atom’s center of mass is m ¨ra(t) = Fext +
Ffric(t), where

Ffric(t) = (cid:104) ˆdi(t) · ∇(cid:107) ˆEi(ra(t), t)(cid:105).

(20)
Here, ∇(cid:107) ≡ (∂x, ∂y) is the gradient parallel to the sur-
face. We assume the existence of an external classi-
cal force Fext on the atom that enforces a prescribed
trajectory ra(t) = (Ra(t), za). For times t < ti, the
atom is static at ra = (Ra, za) and then undergoes an
acceleration for some interval of time. Eventually,
it
reaches a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) given by
ra(t) = (Ra + vt, za) (for a discussion of the inﬂuence
of the boost on a perturbative calculation of quantum
friction, we refer to [26, 28, 67]).

Once again, the total ﬁeld exhibits a component ˆE0
that is only related to the dissipative medium.
In the
dynamical case, however, a separation into positive and
negative frequency parts is inappropriate because these

mitean tensor S†(ω; v) = S(ω; v). This means that its
real part is a symmetric tensor and its imaginary part is
an anti-symmetric tensor. Using these symmetry prop-
erties of the power spectrum, together with those of G(cid:61),
we can rewrite Eq.(23) as the sum of two contributions,

case Cij(τ ; v) =
didj(cid:104)ˆq(τ )ˆq(0)(cid:105)NESS = Cji(τ ; v), i.e., the correlation ten-
sor is symmetric. As a consequence, the power spectrum
is also a symmetric tensor, and hence SI (ω; v) = 0. This
implies that for this model Fr
fric = 0. The physical mean-
ing of the term Fr
fric will be discussed in a more general
context in a forthcoming work [68].

At this point, and within our assumptions, Eq.(25) is
exact. It gives the quantum frictional force on an atom
that asymptotically moves at constant velocity parallel
to the surface.
In order to further evaluate this force,
we need to compute the non-equilibrium power spectrum
tensor S(ω; v). Unfortunately, the calculation of the
dipole power spectrum in the NESS is a complex problem
which often can be addressed only within perturbation
theory.
In the following, we describe two diﬀerent ap-
proaches based again on the FDT and QRT, which yield
markedly diﬀerent predictions for the quantum friction
in the low-velocity limit. This allows us to assess the im-
pact of non-Markovianity on non-equilibrium ﬂuctuation-
induced interactions.

B. FDT in quantum friction

Strictly speaking, it is not valid to use of the FDT
for the problem of a moving atom above a surface since
the system is not in equilibrium. Nevertheless, earlier
works [66, 67, 69, 70] have (implicitly or explicitly) re-
lied on the FDT to calculate quantum friction, assuming
that both the atom and the surface are locally in thermal
equilibrium (LTE). Although the LTE has been used in
the literature for several non-equilibrium systems (e.g.,
radiative heat transfer [11] or static atom-surface and
Casimir forces out-of-thermal equilibrium [13]), its justi-
ﬁcation is still a matter of discussion. We will return to
this point in Section III. Interestingly, however, despite
the lack of general results, in the case of quantum fric-
tion it is still possible to draw general conclusions in the
low-velocity limit [27].

8

For symmetry reason an expansion for low velocities
must contain only odd powers of v. As Gs
I (k, za, ω) is
even in k, the frictional force in Eq.(25) identically van-
ishes for v = 0, as it should. Also, as the power spectrum
explicitly depends on the wave vector only through the
Doppler-shifted frequency ω(cid:48) = ω − k · v, only two terms
can contribute to the drag force in the small velocity
limit: The ﬁrst term is that in which we set the explicit
v-dependence to zero in the Doppler shift and retain the
implicit velocity-dependence through the NESS density
matrix, i.e., SR(−ω; v). The second term is that in which
we set v = 0 in the implicit velocity-dependence and re-
tain the Doppler shift, i.e., SR(−ω(cid:48); v = 0). The ﬁrst
term does not contribute to the low-velocity drag force
because the integral over k in Eq.(25) identically vanishes
I (k, za, ω) is even in k. The factor SR(−ω(cid:48); v = 0) in
as Gs
the second term is identical to the static power spectrum
with negative Doppler-shifted frequency. Because it ef-
fectively corresponds to an equilibrium situation (v = 0
in ρNESS), its contribution to Eq.(25) can be computed
using the corresponding FDT

θ(−ω(cid:48))αI (−ω(cid:48)),

(27)

where α is the polarizability tensor for the atom at rest.
Eq. (27) is a simpliﬁcation of Eq. (8), where we have
removed the superscript ”s” because in our dipole model
the polarizability and the dipole correlator are symmetric
by assumption.

Since the surface is invariant under rotations around
the z-axis, in the following we assume without loss of
generality that the surface-parallel motion occurs in the
x-direction, i.e., v = vxx (x is the unit vector along the x-
direction), which, considering again the parity properties
of the Green tensor, implies that Ffric = Ffricx. Based
on the arguments in the previous paragraph, the linear
order in the velocity is included in

(28)

At this point it is important to clarify the role played
by the diﬀerent terms in the above expression. The cut-
oﬀ in the ω-integral and the restriction to positive kx
is due to the Heaviside function θ(−ω(cid:48)) = θ(kxvx − ω)
in Eq. (27): this enforces a vanishing power spectrum
for positive Doppler-shifted frequencies, revealing an im-
portant part of the underlying physics involved in the
quantum friction process. Indeed, in the NESS as well
as in the static case, only positive frequencies contribute
to the quantum dynamics that results from the energy
exchange among the diﬀerent components of the system.
When vx = 0, ω(cid:48) = ω > 0 and the Heaviside θ(−ω(cid:48)) func-
tion identically vanishes, explaining why the frictional
force is zero at zero velocity. However, due to the mo-
tion, we have that ω(cid:48) = ω − kxvx < 0 in the interval
0 < ω < kxvx, which results in a nonzero contribution

to the integral in Eq.(28). This region corresponds to
the so-called anomalous Doppler-eﬀect [71, 72]:
in this
process part of the kinetic energy is converted in real ex-
citations. This mechanism is very much related to the
physics of the Vavilov-Cherenkov eﬀect [70, 73–76]. The
remaining terms in Eq.(28) are connected to the strength
of the energy exchange and they essentially describe the
density of states for the atomic system (αI ) and for the
electromagnetic ﬁeld emitted by the surface (GI ).

Because they are odd, the imaginary parts of both sus-
ceptibilities vanish at ω = 0, and since the Green tensor
limits the values of wave vectors to |k| (cid:46) z−1
a , an expan-
sion at the lowest order in vx gives

Here, we have assumed that the ﬁrst derivative in ω (indi-
cated by the prime in the above expression) of both ten-
sors does not vanish (Ohmic behavior). Note that when
either α(cid:48)
I are zero, higher (odd) orders in vx ap-
pear in the expansion. A detailed quantitative evaluation
of Eq. (29) requires the knowledge atom’s low-frequency
polarizability, which is mostly known only within a at
least second order perturbative scheme [24, 55–57] (see
also Section II D).

The above arguments demonstrate that, within our de-
scription of the atom, independently of the details of the
internal dynamics (linear or non-linear), the lowest-order
expansion in velocity of the zero-temperature stationary
frictional force on an atom moving above a planar sur-
face is at least cubic in vx. This outcome is in agree-
ment with some of the results available in the literature
[14, 15], and it is formally equivalent to the application
of the LTE+FDT. There are, however, a few points that
distinguish our approach from the use of that approxima-
tion. First, the derivation of Eq. (29) presented above
provides a plausibility argument for the application of
the LTE+FDT to the quantum friction problem. Sec-
ond, the dependence on v3
x is a consequence of a general
property of the polarizability, the crossing relation, and
its behavior at low frequencies. This shows that, at least
for the case of surface-parallel motion, the low velocity
behavior of quantum friction is not related to the details
of the (velocity-modiﬁed) internal dynamics, e.g. velocity
dependent damping rates or level shifts [25, 77]. Third,
in Eq. (29), there can be other v3
x contributions to the
frictional force arising from the intrinsic non-equilibrium
velocity-dependence of the power spectrum S(ω; v).
If
such contributions existed, they would imply a failure
of the LTE approximation in the treatment of quantum
friction. Indeed, we will show in Section III that such ad-
ditional v3
x-contributions do exist for the case of an atom
modelled as a harmonic oscillator.

C. QRT in quantum friction

We now compare to the friction force at low velocities
predicted by the QRT formula. From the previous sub-
section and I C, we may expect a quite diﬀerent behaviour
because of the dependency of the polarizability at low
frequencies.

Our starting point is Eq. (23). Following our discus-
sion in the previous sub-section, in the low-velocity limit
one can approximate the correlator C(τ ; v) by the static
correlator C(τ ; v = 0), and only retain the velocity-
dependence in the Doppler shift (the exp[−i(ω − k · v)τ ]
factor in Eq.(23)). As a result, in order to compute the
frictional force Eq.(23), we need to evaluate the quantity

For simplicity, as before, we considered the case where
both correlation and the polarizability tensors are sym-
metric, dropping all superscripts. The static correlation
tensor, computed with the FDT, is given in Eq.(16). We
recall that the ﬁrst term of the sum in Eq.(16) corre-
sponds to the exponential decay and is the result one
would have obtained via the QRT expression for the
static correlator (such as Eq. (12) for the two-level sys-
tem). After performing the relevant integral, this term
gives rise to the contribution SQRT(k· v − ω) in Eq.(30).
The second contribution in Eq.(30) arises from the last
term of the correlator in Eq.(16), which contains the non-
Markovian (nM) behavior and yields the long time de-
viation from the decaying exponential. Assuming that
the polarizability is a symmetric tensor, we can formally

Performing the relevant integrals in Eq. (30), we obtain
SnM(k · v − ω). This analysis reveals that the two terms
SQRT and SnM are very similar, and cancel each other
for ω(cid:48) = −(ω − k · v) < 0. We shall see now that both
contributions are relevant for the ﬁnal expression of the
frictional force.

Let us consider the ﬁrst term SQRT in Eq.(30) and de-
rive the corresponding QRT form of quantum friction at
low velocities. Using that |k| (cid:46) z−1
and again assuming
without loss of generality that the motion is along the

This means that at low velocities the QRT predicts a
frictional force linear in the velocity of the atom [25, 26].
This result contrasts with the cubic dependence in vx in
Eq. (28).

The diﬀerence between these two outcomes is due to
the behavior of S(ω) at low frequencies (see Section
I C and in particular Fig.
3). Mathematically, this
can be understood by considering the contribution of
SnM(k · v − ω) to Eq.(23): A direct calculation of the
frictional force that originates from this term, results in
an expression that leads to a linear-in-vx part which can-
cels the contribution in Eq.(32) (see Appendix D). Thus,
a higher-order expansion is required and, by symmetry,
the next order to be considered is cubic in vx. The non-
Markovian correction in Eq.(30) equals the ﬁrst term in
the sum for ω(cid:48) = ω − k · v > 0, which is a direct conse-
quence of a vanishing power spectrum for these frequen-
cies (see also Eq.(27)).
In direct connection with the
Weisskopf-Wigner approximation, we have indeed that
SQRT(k · v − ω) contains frequencies which are not al-
lowed and these are responsible for the linear-in-vx be-
havior seen in Eq.(32). The main eﬀect of SnM(k· v− ω)
is to limit the range of integration over frequency to kxvx
as in Eq. (28). In addition, since SQRT(0) + SnM(0) = 0
and, again, GI (k, za, 0) = 0 any further possible linear-
in-vx terms will vanish and an expansion for low velocities
leads to Eq.(29).

contribution in the low-velocity limit arises from fourth
order term. The calculation of this order will require ex-
tra care: as discussed at the end of Sec. I, at fourth order
in the perturbative expansion non-Markovian eﬀects be-
come important. Including them will be therefore crucial
to obtain the correct result for quantum friction.

Within a perturbative framework at second order in
the dipole moment d, the dipole correlator C(τ, v), and
therefore the non-equilibrium power spectrum entering
in Eq. (25), loses its explicit dependence on the veloc-
ity. At this order, the correlation and the linear response
tensors are calculated starting from the free evolution of
the dipole operator: The system is decoupled from the
electromagnetic ﬁeld and, therefore, is locally in thermal
equilibrium. This means that the FDT can be employed,
and the frictional force takes the form of Eq. (28), where
the tensor α must be replaced with the bare polarizabil-

This expression indicates that only wave vectors kx >

the relevant part of Green tensor is proportional to

fric expo-
nentially vanishes in the low velocity limit. To see this
more clearly, we recall that the total Green tensor can be
decomposed as G = G0 + g. Because of Lorentz invari-
ance, the vacuum contribution G0 does not contribute
to the frictional force [78, 79]. The scattered part of the
Green tensor g has a symmetric part (the only relevant
part in Eq.(33)) whose imaginary part in the near-ﬁeld
regime can be written as (see Appendix A)

For a better understanding of the behavior of the fric-
tional force, and also in view of the discussion in Section
III, it is convenient to study the atom-surface frictional
force computed within perturbation theory in the elec-
tric dipole moment d. The most relevant point of this
sub-section is that the perturbative order relevant for a
correct evaluation of the frictional force depends on the
presence or the absence of dissipation in the system. In
particular, a special role is played by dissipation in the
particle’s internal dynamics, with diﬀerences occurring
depending on whether this dissipation is intrinsic or in-
duced (i.e. radiative) by the interaction with the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld. In systems with intrinsic dissipation (e.g.
nano-particles), an approach at second order in the ﬁeld-
dipole coupling provides the leading contribution. For in-
duced dissipation, we will see below that, at second order,
quantum friction is instead exponentially suppressed at
low velocities. In this case, relevant for atoms, the leading

where k = |k| =

tivity. Further, r(ω) = [(ω) − 1]/[(ω) + 1] is the quasi-
static approximation of the transverse magnetic (TM) re-
ﬂection coeﬃcient for the planar surface – here, we recall
that in the near-ﬁeld regime (za (cid:28) c/ω) only the TM
polarization matters for dielectric or metallic surfaces,
and we can neglect the k dependence of the reﬂection co-
eﬃcient (For simplicity, throughout this manuscript we
neglect spatial dispersion).
Let us examine the case of a metallic surface described
by the Drude model (ω) = 1 − ω2
p[ω(ω + iΓ)]−1, where
ωp is the plasma frequency and Γ the relaxation rate.
In the limit of very small dissipation we have rI (ω) ≈

In these expressions, u = (zaωsp/vx)(1 + ωa/ωsp), θ

spα0/(2π0c4), where
α0 = 2|d|2/(3ωa) is the static isotropic atomic polariz-
ability. As an example, for the ground state of a 87Rb
atom (m = 1.44 × 10−25 kg, α0 = 5.26 × 10−39Fm2 [59])
and a plasma frequency ωp = 9 eV, we have F0 ∼ 0.31
fN, corresponding to an accelaration F0/m ∼ 2.17 × 109
m/s2. Equation (35) demonstrates that the frictional
force depends on the orientation of the dipole vector and,
therefore, on an eventual anisotropy of the moving object.
The largest value of F (2)
fric is found for dipoles oriented nor-
mal to the surface (θ = 0) or, if tilted with respect to the
normal, when the vector of the dipole moment exhibits a
large component along the direction of the motion φ = 0.
The minimum value occurs for dipoles oriented along the
y-axis, i.e., when the vector of the dipole moment is per-
pendicular to both, the surface normal and the atom’s
propagation direction (see inset of Fig.5). For simplic-
ity, in the following we will consider expressions averaged
over all dipole orientations, hence, ¯A0 = ¯A2 = 1.

In Fig.
5 we display the velocity dependence of the
second-order quantum frictional force for a substrate
with vanishingly small dissipation, Eq.(35).
It is not
exponentially suppressed only for velocities vx > zaωa,
which follows from the constraint on the wave vec-
tor discussed above. A maximum occurs for vx ≈
(4/7)(ωa + ωsp)za, i.e., roughly when the Doppler-shifted
surface-plasmon resonance frequency is brought into res-
onance with the atomic transition (the reﬂection coeﬃ-
cient r(vx/za−ωa) becomes large) [80]. This means that,
at second order, quantum friction is essentially the result
of a resonant process: The velocity must be suﬃciently
large (within the non-relativistic approach used here) so
that the Doppler eﬀect becomes anomalous, and the cor-
responding shifted frequencies are suﬃciently large in or-
der to include the (sharp) atomic transition and excite
a plasmon. The photon (plasmon) in the near ﬁeld is

Γ/ωsp = 10−3 (dark yellow), and Γ/ωsp = 10−1 (purple). Fur-
ther parameters are ωa/ωsp = 0.2 and zaωsp/c = 0.05, corre-
sponding to the near-ﬁeld regime, and vx/c = 0.04. The inset

then scattered out of its ground state, while the atom is
temporarily excited. The ﬁrst photon is then followed by
a second one resulting from the atomic decay, and both
are ﬁnally absorbed by the surface [28].
When dissipation in the substrate is taken into ac-
count (Γ (cid:54)= 0), the second-order quantum frictional force
essentially exhibits resonant behavior at high velocities
(vx > zaωa), as discussed above (see Fig. 5). At low
velocities it still decays exponentially, but acquires a dif-
ferent asymptotic behavior due to the modiﬁcation of the
electromagnetic density of states, and is described by

III. FAILURE OF THE LTE APPROXIMATION

IN QUANTUM FRICTION

The results obtained at the end of the previous sec-
tion are the same one would obtain within standard
ﬂuctuational electrodynamics [67, 69, 70, 81]. Within
this approach, it is assumed that the particle and the
ﬁeld+matter are in their respective rest frames (locally)
at thermal equilibrium, and that the FDT can be sepa-
rately applied for each of the subsystems. In quantum
friction, LTE+FDT represent a reasonable approxima-
tion as long as the subsystems are spatially uncorrelated
in the steady state. It is important to remark that strictly
speaking (and just as in the case of the Markov approx-
imation [17]), this description is only justiﬁed within
a second-order perturbative approach in the atom-ﬁeld
coupling constant (see Sec. II D).

For systems such as atoms, a second-order perturba-
tive approach implies a dissipation-less description of the
internal dynamics which, as we have shown above, leads
to an exponentially vanishing friction at low velocities.
Since dissipation plays an important role in quantum fric-
tion, a higher-order calculation is required, but in this
case standard ﬂuctuational electrodynamics becomes in-
adequate for calculating the frictional force. In order to
assess more precisely the impact of the LTE approxima-
tion on the physics of quantum friction, we consider in
this section an exactly solvable model based on a moving
harmonic oscillator [29]. Speciﬁcally, we derive a gen-
eralized non-equilibrium FDT that is valid for a NESS
where the oscillator is moving at constant velocity par-
allel to the surface. In the low-velocity limit, we further
show that the resulting quantum frictional force has the
v3
x-behavior predicted in sub-section II B but the mag-
nitude predicted by the non-equilibrium FDT is almost
twice that of the standard LTE+FDT approach (see Fig.
7). As a result, our exactly solvable model represents a
speciﬁc example of the breakdown of the LTE approxima-
tion in non-equilibrium ﬂuctuation-induced interactions.

A. FDT-like relation in a NESS

There is an extensive literature on non-equilibrium
ﬂuctuation theorems, and part of it addresses the gen-
eralization of fundamental equilibrium results such as
the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem to non-equilibrium
steady-states [82–86]. Some of the diﬃculties encoun-
tered in this ﬁeld arise from the identiﬁcation of the
steady-state density matrix, which is no longer described
by the standard Gibbs state. Progress has been made for

spα0/(2π0c4). The particle has an internal resonance
frequency ωa/ωsp = 0.2 and moves at a distance zaωsp/c =
0.05 above the surface, corresponding to the near-ﬁeld regime.
Results for two diﬀerent values of the intrinsic dissipation are
displayed: γ/ωsp = 10−1 (dark yellow) and γ/ωsp = 10−3
(red). In both cases, the damping Γ is set to Γ/ωsp = 10−1.

p
quency and the dissipation rate for the bulk metal that
comprises the particle. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, when
both sub-systems have ﬁnite dissipation, at low velocity a
further asymptotic appears in the force given in Eq.(28),
and the frictional force is described by

Contrary to the previous cases, the second-order quan-
tum frictional force for systems with intrinsic dissipation
does not exponentially vanish at low velocities, but rather
exhibits a cubic velocity dependence, just as predicted by
Eq.(29) on the basis of general arguments (both the po-
larizability and the Green tensor have a non vanishing
ﬁrst derivative with respect to ω).
In Fig. 6 we dis-
play all the three cases discussed above. Note that when
both sources of dissipation are non-zero, the quantum
frictional force approaches the results of the other cases
for larger velocities. Speciﬁcally, the case Γ (cid:54)= 0, γ → 0 is
approached ﬁrst and this is followed by approaching the
case Γ, γ → 0.
The three asymptotic expressions for low vx derived
above cannot be obtained from each other by taking γ →
0 or Γ → 0, indicating that these limits do not commute
and that, at low velocities, dissipation is very relevant for
quantum frictional processes. This behavior is directly
related to the corresponding increase in the density of
states at low frequencies that is induced by dissipation
(cf. the discussion following Eq. (28)). Finally, although

state of the system. Using the expression of the dipole
operator in terms of ˆE0 given above, we can compute
the dipole-dipole correlation in terms of the ﬁeld-ﬁeld
correlator. The ﬁeld-matter subsystem is assumed to be
initially in its ground state and the FDT gives

on the fact that the matrix dd represents a symmetric

FIG. 7. Schematic representation of the diﬀerence between
the LTE approximation (a) and the full non-equilibrium de-

sumed that the atom and the surface are separately in ther-

description allows to use of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theo-
rem for each sub-system, to approximatively describe the full

the non-equilibrium system is, however, more important than
implicitly assumed in the LTE approximation, which under-
estimates the ﬁnal result by a factor two (see the main text).

works are mostly concerned with classical systems and
include the Markov approximation among the initial set
of assumptions.

For our system we are going to focus on the internal
dynamics of the dipole operator ˆd(t) = dˆq(t), where ˆq(t)
is modeled as a harmonic oscillator of frequency ωa. In
the non-relativistic approximation, and neglecting mag-

In the stationary

Ra + vt(cid:48). Upon inserting Eq. (41) into the equation of
motion for the dipole, we obtain the stationary solution

FDT for the moving harmonic oscillator. When com-
pared to Eq.(27), it shows that when the system is in the
NESS and an extra term J appears. Further, this form
is similar to classical non-equilibrium generalizations of
the FDT where the additional term is related to entropy
production [83, 84].

Upon inserting Eq. (48) into Eq.(25), we obtain two

distinct contributions to the quantum frictional force,

Ffric = Fα

fric + FJ

fric.

(50)

They, respectively, arise from the ﬁrst and second terms
on the right hand side of (48). The term Fα
fric is the term
one obtains using the LTE [15, 67, 78], while the term
FJ
fric is a pure eﬀect of the non-equilibrium dynamics of
our system. We shall now compute each of these terms
separately in the low velocity limit.

B. Low-velocity expansion

To see more clearly how quantum friction is modiﬁed
by the above considerations, we compute the low-velocity
expansion of the force in Eq. (25) using Eq. (48). First
of all, without loss of generality, it is again convenient
to assume that the motion occurs along the x-direction.
In addition and as above, we will consider only the near-
ﬁeld limit for the scattered part of the Green tensor g
deﬁned in Eq. (34). When the motion occurs along the

(36). For our approach it is also convenient to intro-
duce the dimensionless variables V = vx/c, Z = zaωsp/c,
ξ = ω/ωsp = νV /Z, and w = kxza, where ωsp represents
a characteristic frequency of the surface (e.g., the surface

of the function γ(ω; v) deﬁned in Eq. (44b) averaged over

systems with radiative damping, the functional depen-

is modiﬁed relative to that of systems with intrinsic dis-
sipation [25–27].

tive damping becomes less relevant and the force is rather ac-
curately described by the asymptotic expression given in Eq.

locities (vx/c (cid:38) 10−3 for the parameters in Fig. 8) the
behavior can qualitatively be understood in terms of the
asymptotic expressions discussed in Section II D.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Using general concepts of quantum statistical mechan-
ics, we have investigated the impact of non-Markovianity
and non-equilibrium physics on atom-surface ﬂuctuation-
induced interactions. Speciﬁcally, we have shown that
two widely used approximations, the Markov approxima-
tion and the local equilibrium approximation can lead to
erroneous results, both with regard to magnitude and
functional dependence on physical parameters.

In the static case, we have analyzed the failure of the

tained using the FDT and the QRT. The FDT has led to
a non-perturbative expression for the zero-temperature
Casimir-Polder force, Eq.(10). The FDT-based result
contains the previously known expressions as special
cases (see Appendix B for details). We have shown
that an alternative approach based on the QRT agrees
with the FDT within lowest-order in perturbation the-
ory in the atom-ﬁeld coupling strength, but diﬀer at
higher orders. This can be intuitively understood by
recalling that the QRT relies on the Born-Markov ap-
proximation, which works well for weak atom-ﬁeld cou-
plings and in a narrow range of frequencies close to reso-
nance. This eﬀectively limits the applicability of the QRT
for ﬂuctuation-induced interactions, given the broadband
nature of the latter.

The diﬀerence between the FDT and the QRT be-
comes even more pronounced when non-equilibrium ef-
fects are considered. Speciﬁcally, the distinct behavior
at large times/low frequencies of the dipole-dipole cor-
relation function is responsible for the diﬀerent scaling
laws of quantum friction with regard to atom velocity
and atom-surface separation. Assuming for low frequen-
cies an Ohmic behavior of the material. we have shown
that, when (induced or intrinsic) dissipation is incorpo-
rated both, for the constituent material and the atom dy-
namics, quantum friction scales as ∝ v3
x for low velocities.
By contrast, a Markovian approach leads to a behavior
∝ vx. More generally, the exponent of the power law
at low velocities is strongly related to the low frequency
behavior of the atomic and the material susceptibilities.
This explains why dissipation is so relevant: quantum
friction is dominated by low frequencies and there damp-
ing increases the density of states, thus opening new in-
teraction channels.

For systems that exhibit intrinsic dissipation (e.g. a
nano-particle above a surface) a second-order perturba-
tive calculation is suﬃcient to compute the leading term
of low-velocity quantum friction (see Sec.
II D). How-
ever, for systems exhibiting only radiative damping (e.g.,
atoms), a consistent higher-order (fourth at least) calcu-
lation is required [26, 28] in order to accurately describe
the quantum frictional process. However, this procedure
requires great care since the Markov approximation is not
the only approximation that breaks down in this case. In-
deed, we have shown that approximations where the mov-
ing atom and the surface are locally in thermal equilib-
rium with their surroundings (LTE+FDT) lead to erro-
neous results. To illustrate this, we have worked out the
model of a harmonic oscillator moving parallel to a sur-
face. Speciﬁcally, we have shown that LTE+FDT under-
estimates the role of non-equilibrium processes and that
the quantitative results of our model leads to a quantum
frictional force that is almost twice the value predicted
by the LTE+FDT approach (see Eq.(62)). Our results
call for a re-evaluation of quantum friction in all those se-
tups where the approximation has been used, especially
if radiative damping is dominant.

16

The approach presented in this manuscript is based
on stationary systems and is thus not suitable for the
analysis of non-steady-state conﬁgurations, e.g., an ex-
cited atom. However, it has recently been shown that in
the case of non-stationary quantum friction the salient
features of our results can also be recovered within a
time-dependent perturbative approach to the fourth or-
der in the atom-ﬁeld coupling strength [28]. Intuitively,
one can understand this result in terms of the charac-
teristic time τNESS which the system needs to reach the
non-equilibrium steady state – as even within a time-
dependent perturbative scheme, steady-state features be-
come relevant as soon as we consider t (cid:29) τNESS.

Finally, due to its small value and given the level of
accuracy of the present theoretical techniques, an exper-
imental detection of quantum friction is certainly chal-
lenging and designing setups that increase the strength
of the interaction is certainly desirable. Our analysis in-
dicates that the atomic and material properties are the
most important parameters to focus on.
Interestingly,
these properties enter in the low velocity asymptotic of
quantum friction through the atomic decay rate, γ(za) ≈
a) (we used rI (ωa) ≈ 2ρ0ωa). Speciﬁcally,

Eq. (62) can be rewritten as

This demonstrates that, at low velocities, quantum fric-
tion is proportional to the square of the induced decay
rate. This feature suggests possible pathways to increase
the strength of the quantum frictional force. For in-
stance, materials with complex properties (e.g., strong
nonlocality [92, 93]) or geometric conﬁgurations (e.g., hy-
perbolic nanostructures [93]) which are known for pro-
ducing large Purcell factors, are potentially favorable for
enhancing the quantum frictional force.

G(r2, r1; ω) (the superscript T indicates the transposed
matrix) and G(r, r(cid:48), ω) = G∗(r, r(cid:48),−ω) which are, re-
spectively, consequences of reciprocity and the fact that
in the time domain its elements are real. Further, the
Green tensor represents a susceptibility and, therefore,
it is analytic in the upper half of the complex frequency
plane and its real and imaginary parts satisfy Kramer-
Kronig relations [94]. As a ﬁrst consequence, we have

where k = (kx, ky) denotes the in-plane wave vector

feature the same z-coordinate. From the reality and
reciprocity of the Green tensor, one gets GT(k, z; ω) =
G(−k, z; ω), G∗(k, z; ω) = G(−k, z;−ω), and therefore
G†(k, z; ω) = G(k, z;−ω). Based on these properties one
can also deduce that the symmetric part of the Green
tensor Gs(k, z, ω) is even in k, while the antisymmetric
(cid:90) d2k
part Gas(k, z, ω) is odd in k. We can then write

Despite formal similarities, Eq.
(B1) diﬀers from the
standard formulas found in the literature for the atom-
surface interaction. Our derivation of Eq. (B1) is non-
perturbative [24] as it does not rely on any perturba-
tive weak-coupling expansion. It is, therefore, diﬀerent
from the expression for the Casimir-Polder force obtained
in second-order perturbation theory [5, 43, 44].
In the
latter, the position-independent polarizability α(0)(ω)
replaces the dressed, position-dependent polarizability
α(ω, ra) and thus it corresponds to the lowest order of
the perturbative expansion of Eq.
(B1) in the cou-
pling strength.
Indeed, the bare polarizability repre-
sents the Fourier transform of the response function
α(0)(τ ) = (i/)θ(τ )tr[[ˆd(0)(τ ), ˆd(0)(0)]ˆρa], where only
the free dipole evolution is considered (ˆρa describes the
atomic ground state.)

Perhaps more relevant is the diﬀerence between Eq.
(B1) and the corresponding Lifshitz formula in the scat-
tering formulation [8, 23, 34, 95],

(B2)
In this case, the force is given in terms of the scattering
properties of the surface and the atom is treated as a
non-interacting scatterer: The quantity αvac(ω) is the
position-independent dressed polarizability for the atom
placed in the free electromagnetic vacuum (it diﬀers from
α(0)(ω) as it contains the Lamb shift and spontaneous
decay rate), while g(r, r(cid:48), ω) is again the scattered part
of the Green tensor [23].

The denominator in the above expression indicates
multiple reﬂections of the electric ﬁeld between the atom
and the surface. Keeping only one round-trip in the
atom-surface multiple reﬂections process [96], one obtains
an expression which is formally similar to Eq.(B1) but
where αvac(ω) replaces α(ω, ra). When all multiple re-
ﬂections are kept, Eq. (B2) becomes identical to Eq.(B1)
provided that

α(ra, ω) =(cid:2)1 − αvac(ω) · g(ra, ra, ω)(cid:3)−1 · αvac(ω). (B3)

This corresponds to a particular re-summation of the
perturbation series, and the underlying condition is that
the atom responds linearly to the electric ﬁeld. For ex-
ample, when the atom is modeled as a linear harmonic
oscillator system, the equation of motion of the dipole
operator ˆd = dˆq is Eq.
(40) for the atom at rest.
Here, ˆE(r, t) = ˆE0(r, t) + ˆES(r, t) is the sum of the ﬁeld
without the atom (E0(r, t)) and the ﬁeld generated by
the dipole (ES(r, ω) = G(r, ra, ω) · dˆq(ω)).
In Fourier
space, the stationary dipole’s dynamics is then given by
ˆd(ω, ra) = α(ω, ra) · ˆE0(ra, ω) which implicitly deﬁnes
the atom’s polarizability as

This is the expression for the polarizability that enters
in Eq.(B1) which, as expected, depends on the position
of the oscillator through the radiation reaction ﬁeld rep-
resented by the Green tensor. If the atom is isolated in
vacuum, one must replace G by G0 to recover αvac(ω).
Finally, using that G = G0 + g one can show that, in the
case of an oscillator, α(ra, ω) and αvac(ω) are related as
described in Eq. (B3).

where ˜ωa(ra) and γ(ra) are non-negative quantities. The
integrand in (C1c) has poles in the lower part of the
complex-frequency plane. Thus, a standard Wick rota-
tion can be performed, resulting in an integration over
the positive imaginary frequency axis. For the integral
in (C1a), we notice that the integrand has all poles in
the lower part of the complex-frequency plane with the
exception of ω = −˜ωa(ra) + iγ(ra) which is actually lo-
cated in the upper left quadrant. This means that a
similar Wick rotation in the ﬁrst integrand is still pos-
sible. For the term appearing in (C1b) we can utilize
that G∗(ra, r, ω) = G(ra, r,−ω) and a change of vari-
able ω → −ω. The resulting integral running from −∞
to zero concerns an integrand with poles in the lower
part of the complex-frequency plane. A similar proce-
dure for the term in (C1d) leads to an integral where
all the poles of the Green tensor are in the lower part
of the complex-frequency plane, except for one pole at
ω = ˜ωa(ra) + iγ(ra) that is located in the ﬁrst quadrant.
Since the corresponding integral again runs from −∞ to
zero we can still perform a rotation of the complex path
in the second quadrant. This procedure leads to

where we have already assumed that the polarization ten-
sor is symmetric (see Eq.(15)). In addition, in the last
step we have used the Kramer-Kronig relation [97] (for
simplicity, we have suppressed the dependence of the po-
larizability on ra). When added to Eq. (14) the above
expression reproduces Eq. (10).

Appendix D: Non-Markovian contribution to

quantum friction

Recalling that Gs
I (k, za, ω = 0) = 0, we have that the
leading term in the expansion for low velocities is pro-
vided by the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of this
equation. Consequently, we obtain in leading order

The importance of non-Markovianity to quantum fric-
tion can be assessed by considering the term SnM(k·v−ω)

This exactly compensates the contribution arising from
the QRT (cfr. Eq. (32)).

[54] It is important to point out, however, that this is only an
approximation valid in weak coupling. In reality, it is the
global system that goes to a highly correlated stationary
equilibrium state; in general, the reduced state of the
atom is given by a mixture of ground and excited states
