ABSTRACT

Chondritic meteorites provide valuable opportunities to investigate the origins of the solar system.
We explore impact jetting as a mechanism of chondrule formation and subsequent pebble accretion as
a mechanism of accreting chondrules onto parent bodies of chondrites, and investigate how these two
processes can account for the currently available meteoritic data. We ﬁnd that when the solar nebula
is ≤ 5 times more massive than the minimum-mass solar nebula at a ≃ 2 − 3 AU and parent bodies
of chondrites are ≤ 1024 g (≤ 500 km in radius) in the solar nebula, impact jetting and subsequent
pebble accretion can reproduce a number of properties of the meteoritic data. The properties include
the present asteroid belt mass, the formation timescale of chondrules, and the magnetic ﬁeld strength
of the nebula derived from chondrules in Semarkona. Since this scenario requires a ﬁrst generation
of planetesimals that trigger impact jetting and serve as parent bodies to accrete chondrules, the
upper limit of parent bodies’ masses leads to the following implications: primordial asteroids that
were originally ≥ 1024 g in mass were unlikely to contain chondrules, while less massive primordial
asteroids likely had a chondrule-rich surface layer. The scenario developed from impact jetting and
pebble accretion can therefore provide new insights into the origins of the solar system.

1. INTRODUCTION

Chondritic meteorites can be regarded as a fossil record
of how the solar system formed (e.g., Davis et al. 2014).
The most invaluable records are contained in chondrules,
which are the most abundant ingredient in chondrites.
Chondrules are millimeter-sized spherical particles that
are formed as the consequence of transient heating events
occurring in the solar nebula (e.g., Hewins et al. 2005).
Since such events may be relevant to important pro-
cesses regulating the nebula evolution (e.g., Desch et al.
2012), investigating chondrule formation can shed light
on the origins of the solar system. Chondrites them-
selves also possess profound information.
It is widely
accepted that chondrites are fragments of planetesimals
originating from the asteroid belt (e.g., DeMeo et al.
2015). Taking into account the consideration that plan-
etesimals are the building blocks of planets, understand-
ing of how chondrites are generated from their parent
bodies can provide fundamental insight into the time evo-
lution of the asteroid belt, planetesimal formation, and
even (perhaps) the formation of (exo)planetary systems
(e.g., Vernazza et al. 2014; Johansen et al. 2015).

Signiﬁcant progress has

recently been made on
chondrule formation and accretion.
For instance,
Johnson et al. (2015) have produced a pioneering work
in which planetesimal collisions and the resultant impact
jetting are proposed as a mechanism of chondrule for-
mation. They have found that ejected materials from
the collisional surface can reproduce the thermal his-
tory of chondrules, and the collisional frequency dur-
ing planetary accretion is high enough to account for
the present asteroid belt mass (also see Hasegawa et al.
2016). In addition, an experimental study revealed that

yasuhiro@caltech.edu

primitive chondrites and the chondrules embedded in
them can retain the information of the magnetic ﬁeld
strength of the solar nebula (Fu et al. 2014). Further-
more, Lambrechts & Johansen (2012) have performed
numerical simulations and shown that gas drag acting on
pebbles can substantially accelerate the growth of mas-
sive bodies due to the eﬃcient accretion of pebbles onto
the bodies (also see Ormel & Klahr 2010; Guillot et al.
2014; Kretke & Levison 2014). This process can be
viewed as a mechanism of chondrule accretion onto par-
ent bodies of chondrites (Johansen et al. 2015).

Here we synthesize these recent steps on chondrule for-
mation and accretion, and explore how impact jetting
and subsequent pebble accretion can be consistent with
the meteorite conditions. We show below that the cou-
pling of these processes with the meteorite data can pro-
vide tight constraints on the mass of the solar nebula at
a ≃ 2 − 3 AU and the size of parent bodies of chondrites
in the solar nebula. We will therefore conclude that both
impact jetting and pebble accretion are intriguing pro-
cesses for obtaining some valuable clues about the origins
of the solar system.

and the mean molecular weight is taken as 2.3 in units of

2.2. Impact jetting

We consider impact jetting as one of the primary pro-
cesses for generating chondrules which can occur during
planetary accretion. For this case, the resultant abun-
dance of chondrules can be characterized well by fIJ Miso
as long as formed protoplanets can reach Miso within a
given disk lifetime (Hasegawa et al. 2016).2 This formula

is obtained because chondrule-forming collisions can be
realized when protoplanets undergo oligarchic growth
and acquire most of their masses (e.g., Kokubo & Ida
1998).

The total abundance of chondrules for 2AU . a . 3AU
can be readily computed as (see Hasegawa et al. (2016)
for a complete discussion and references)

Equation (6) assumes that protoplanets are separated
by their feeding zones (≃ 10rH ) with each other, and
that chondrules were formed over a time interval τch.
Since meteorite records indicate that chondrule forma-
tion began around the time of CAI formation and con-
tinued for 3 − 5 × 106 years (e.g., Connelly et al. 2012;
Bollard et al. 2015), two characteristic values of τch are
considered (τch = 3 × 106 years and τch = 5 × 106 years,
see Figure 1). In the summation, terms contribute only
if τch is longer than the time (τIJ ) for protoplanets to
grow up to Miso, which is given as (Ida & Makino 1993)

Note that both the gas and the dust densities

Hasegawa et al. (2016) are increased by a factor of 1.5 for the stan-
dard model, following Kokubo & Ida (2000).

2 The adopted value of fIJ may be a lower limit because it is
derived only from vertical impacts, with a conservative estimate of
the threshold impact velocity (Johnson et al. 2015).

As found by Hasegawa et al. (2016), fτ = 3 is needed
to reproduce the results of more detailed calculations.3
Also, the oligarchic phase is assumed in computing plan-
etesimals’ eccentricity (he2
eqi), wherein the balance be-
tween the pump up of he2
eqi by a protoplanet and its
damping by the disk gas is considered. Thus, mch,IJ is
calculated based on the semi-analytical formulation de-
veloped in Hasegawa et al. (2016), under the assumption
that protoplanet-planetesimal collisions play a dominant
role for mch,IJ.

Figure 1 shows the resultant value of mch,IJ as a func-
tion of fd. The value of mpl varies from 1022 g to 2×1024
g in each panel, in order to examine its dependence on
mch,IJ (see equation (10)). The results show that mch,IJ
is very low for small values of fd, and it rises suddenly
as fd increases (see the vertical dotted line). This occurs
because a disk becomes massive enough at that time,
so that a growing protoplanet at a = 2 AU can reach
Miso within given values of τch. Once fd exceeds these
critical values, the increment of mch,IJ becomes grad-
ual until other sudden jumps in mch,IJ appear. These
jumps originate from an additional contribution arising
from another protoplanet that can now reach Miso within
τch by increasing fd. Note that this secondly formed pro-
toplanet is separated from the ﬁrst formed protoplanet
by ∆a ≃ 0.1 AU.
The results also show that the ﬁrst sudden rises of
mch,IJ require a higher value of fd as mpl increases (see
the vertical dotted line on each panel in Figure 1). This is
a simple reﬂection of τIJ that is an increasing function of
mpl (see equations (8), (9), and (10)); when massive plan-
etesimals are involved in planetary accretion, the value of
he2
eqi becomes higher, since the eccentricity damping by
the disk gas becomes less eﬀective. Then, the growth rate
of a protoplanet slows down. As a result, a higher value
of fd is needed to accelerate the formation of protoplan-
ets, in order to satisfy the condition that protoplanets
obtain Miso within τch.

Thus, the abundance of chondrules formed by impact
jetting through planetesimal collisions is very likely sig-
niﬁcant enough to reproduce the present asteroid belt
mass; for given values of τch, the formation of protoplan-
ets at a ≃ 2 AU generates a large amount of chondrules
for reasonable values of fd and mpl. This ﬁnding is con-
sistent with the previous studies (Johnson et al. 2015;
Hasegawa et al. 2016). Nonetheless, it is obvious that the
results degenerate for certain ranges of fd and mpl. We
will determine the ranges in these two quantities below,
using further constraints from meteorite measurements.

2.3. Magnetic records of chondrules

Magnetic ﬁelds can play an important role in evolu-
tion of circumstellar disks (e.g., Turner et al. 2014). The

3 In Hasegawa et al. (2016), τIJ is labeled as τend.

Figure 1. Mass of chondrules (mch,IJ ) produced by impact jet-
ting via planetary accretion at a = 2 − 3 AU as a function of fd
(see Table 1). The value of mpl varies from 1022 g (top) to 2 × 1024
g (bottom). For comparison purposes, both the primordial and the
present asteroid belt masses are plotted as the horizontal dotted
lines. The minimum value of fd above which mch,IJ is large enough
to reproduce the required abundance of chondrules increases with
increasing mpl (see the vertical dotted line).

existence of these ﬁelds in the solar nebula is supported
by measurements of the Semarkona ordinary chondrite
(Fu et al. 2014).
In Fu et al’s experiment, the ther-
moremanent magnetization of chondrules in the chon-
drite and the direction of magnetic ﬁelds are measured
simultaneously. These measurements suggest that some
chondrules in this sample very likely recorded the mag-

4

Hasegawa et al

netic ﬁeld strength that they experienced well before
being accreted by their parent body.
In other words,
the data trace the magnetic ﬁeld strength of the solar
nebula around the chondrule-forming region, which is
hBi ≃ 50− 540 mG.4 This information is of fundamental
importance for characterizing the strength of turbulence
in the nebula, which can be computed as (e.g., Wardle
2007; Okuzumi & Hirose 2011)
αeﬀ = hBrBφi

ΣghgΩ2 ≤ hBi2
ΣghgΩ2 ,

(11)

where Br and Bφ are the radial and the azimuthal com-
ponents of magnetic ﬁelds, respectively, and the famous
α-prescription is adopted to label the turbulent strength
(Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). We will use the resultant
value of αeﬀ (and hBi) below.

2.4. Pebble accretion

Pebble accretion is a promising candidate pro-
cess for forming the chondrite parent bodies (e.g.,
Lambrechts & Johansen 2012; Johansen et al. 2015).
For this case, the vertical scale heights of chondrules
(hch) and the planetesimals that accrete them (hpl)
are important for determining the accretion eﬃciency.
Speciﬁcally, pebble accretion is most eﬃcient for plan-
etesimals with a scale height hpl < hch, namely, when
they lie among the pebbles (Levison et al. 2015). We
assume this holds in the following. Note that τch (∼
3 − 5 × 106 years) is longer than the timescale at which
a steady state of hpl is achieved, which is less than 106
years (Kokubo & Ida 2000).

Chondrules are typically about 1 mm in size, and large
enough to settle toward the midplane due to stellar grav-
ity. In addition, the solar nebula is very likely turbulent,
which diﬀuses chondrules vertically. Based on equation
(11), αeﬀ ≃ 10−4− 10−2 for fd & 4 at a ≃ 2− 3 AU. This
is a manifestation that shows that magnetic ﬁeld can play
an important role in the solar nebula. As a result, hch
can be determined by the balance between stirring and
settling. Then, hch can be written as (Dubrulle et al.
1995)

hch(rch)

√1 + H 2

,

where

H =(cid:18)

1

1 + γturb(cid:19)1/4s αeﬀ Σg
√2πρchrch

.

(12)

(13)

This formula is consistent with other studies (e.g.,
Youdin & Lithwick 2007), and MHD simulations show
that this approach works well for turbulent regions (e.g.,
Fromang & Papaloizou 2006).

For the planetesimals (hpl), an eccentricity pump-up
by a protoplanet is very likely to dominate over the ef-
fect of the random torque caused by turbulence in the
eqi1/2 ∼ 10−1 − 10−2
solar nebula. This is because he2
for the former, while he2
eqi1/2 ∼ 10−2 − 10−3 for the lat-
ter, given that αeﬀ ≃ 10−2 − 10−4 (e.g., Ida et al. 2008;

4 The estimate is based on measurements from eight chondrules,
each of which might have recorded the magnetic ﬁeld strength at
diﬀerent locations and times.

Gressel et al. 2012). If this is the case,
eqi1/2/2,

hpl ≃ ahe2

(14)

under the assumption that the planetesimals’ random
motions reach equipartition between eccentricity and in-
clination. Note that hpl depends both on fd and on mpl
(see equation (10)). Then, we can ﬁnd out the minimum
value of magnetic ﬁelds (hBimin) above which pebbles
are stirred enough to make their accretion eﬃcient by
equating hch with hpl (using equation (11));

hBi≥ (2π(1 + γturb))1/4sρchrchhgΩ2

≡hBimin.

(hpl/hg)2

1 − (hpl/hg)2(15)

Thus, we can compare hBimin with that derived from
the chondrite (see Section 2.5).
Figure 2 shows the results of hBimin as a function of
both fd and mpl. The calculations are done at a = 2
AU, because this is where the main contribution to form
chondrules occurs (see Section 2.2). We ﬁnd that hBimin
increases with increasing fd. This trend can be under-
stood as the following. As a disk becomes more massive
(a higher value of fd), the value of Miso also becomes
higher. This in turn pumps up the planetesimals’ ec-
centricities (he2
eqi) and their scale heights (hpl). Conse-
quently, a higher value of hBimin is needed to fulﬁll the
condition that hch = hpl. For the dependence of mpl
on hBimin (see each panel), the results show that when
massive planetesimals are considered, the required value
of hBimin becomes higher for a given value of fd. This is
simply because hpl is an increasing function of mpl; the
eccentricity damping by the disk gas becomes weaker for
massive planetesimals (see equation (10)). As a result,
hBimin should be stronger in order to expand the peb-
ble sea for the vertical direction to catch up with the
increment of hpl by increasing mpl.

Thus, the coupling of pebble accretion with the dynam-
ics of planetesimals that is regulated by growing proto-
planets enables an estimate of magnetic ﬁelds that are
needed to achieve eﬃcient pebble accretion in the sys-
tem.

2.5. New constraints on fd and mpl

We are now in a position to derive new constraints on
the solar nebula and parent bodies of chondrites, under
the assumption that impact jetting and subsequent peb-
ble accretion play a dominant role in forming the bodies.
Based on the discussion in Section 2.2, a lower limit of
fd is obtained. Above this limit both the abundance of
chondrules and their formation timescales are consistent
with the meteoritic data (see the vertical dotted line in
Figure 1). An upper limit of fd comes from comparing
hBimin with the magnetic ﬁelds inferred from Semarkona
(see the vertical dashed line in Figure 2, also see Section
2.4).
In the end, the most likely values of fd can be
speciﬁed as a function of mpl (see the hatched region in
Figure 2). It is important that the hatched region shrinks
as mpl increases, and it eventually disappears for the case
in which mpl > 1024 g.

Our results therefore demonstrate that the combina-
tion of impact jetting with pebble accretion can satisfy

all the currently available meteoritic data when the solar
nebula is ≤ 5 times more massive than the MMSN at
a ≃ 2 − 3 AU and parent bodies of chondrite are ≤ 1024
g in the solar nebula.

3. DISCUSSION

So far we have assumed that chondrules generated from
forming protoplanets via impact jetting are accreted by
the surrounding ﬁeld planetesimals as long as hpl < hch.
What happens if the condition that hpl < hch is not
satisﬁed? For this case, it is expected that the major-
ity of chondrules will be accreted by the protoplanets
and/or the central star.
In the current asteroid belt,
chondrules are apparently ubiquitous. In addition, pro-
toplanets are too large to be disrupted to form asteroids.
Furthermore, it is obvious that smaller planetesimals col-
lectively have a larger surface area than more massive
bodies (Johnson et al. 2015). Thus, it is necessary that
(at least) some fractions of chondrules should be accreted
by small planetesimals.

Our results can be compatible with several previous
ﬁndings. Morbidelli et al. (2009) suggest that the plan-
etesimals originally at the asteroid belt’s location were
at least 50 km in radius. This planetesimal radius or
even a higher value (up to 500 km in radius) is needed
to reproduce a bump observed at the planetesimal ra-
dius of ∼ 50 km in the size distribution of the current
asteroid belt.
In addition, Johansen et al. (2015) have
recently shown that planetesimals with a characteristic
radius of ∼ 100 km can experience eﬃcient pebble ac-
cretion within ∼ 3 × 106 years. Since planetesimals that
are smaller than 50 − 100 km in radius can be gener-
ated as fragments of larger bodies (e.g., Morbidelli et al.
2009; DeMeo et al. 2015), their results may provide a
lower limit of parent bodies’ mass.
If this is the case,
coupling of our results with theirs enables the identiﬁca-
tion of a certain range of mpl for primordial asteroids.
Furthermore, a higher value of fd(> 1) is consistent with
the ﬁnding derived from the standard core accretion pic-
ture applied to the solar system (e.g., Pollack et al. 1996;
Hubickyj et al. 2005) as well as the populations of exo-
planets (e.g., Thommes et al. 2008; Hasegawa & Pudritz
2013); more massive disks than the MMSN are required
to form Jupiter and Saturn.

Another important implication derived from our re-
sults may be the mass segregation of parent bodies in
terms of chondrule inclusion. In our scenario, the pres-
ence of a ﬁrst generation of planetesimals is needed both
for impact jetting and for pebble accretion. Then, the
resultant constraint on parent bodies’ size may imply
that chondrules might have had less of a chance to be
accreted by primordial asteroids that were ≥ 500 km in
radius, while smaller primordial asteroids likely had a
surface layer in which chondrules were abundant. It is
also interesting that the new constraint on mpl(≤ 1024
g) is roughly comparable to the mass of Vesta/Ceres. A
careful examination of Vesta/Ceres may lead to acquisi-
tion of further clues about our scenario.

It is clear that a more detailed investigation is needed
to verify the picture discussed here. For instance, our
scenario requires a ﬁrst generation of planetesimals as
discussed above. Possible mechanisms to form such plan-
etesimals (i.e., streaming instabilities, Johansen et al.
2007) should be further explored in this context. Also,

Figure 2. Minimum value of the magnetic ﬁeld strength (hBimin )
threading the solar nebula, which is needed to achieve eﬃcient
chondrule accretion onto planetesimals, as a function of fd (see
Table 1). The value of mpl varies on each panel (as Figure 1).
The vertical dashed line denotes a critical value of fd above which
chondrule accretion onto planetesimals is not realized. Coupling
with the constraint derived from the chondrule abundance (see
the vertical dotted line, which is identical to the one in Figure
1), the results show that all the requirements inferred from the
currently available meteoritic samples can be met when fd ≤ 5
and mpl ≤ 1024 g at a = 2 AU (see the hatched region).

6

Hasegawa et al

detailed studies of how the resultant chondrules can be
accreted onto planetesimals under the presence of a pro-
toplanet should be undertaken. One of the key steps may
be to perform numerical simulations that treat the ran-
dom torque on protoplanets from turbulent disks, which
may aﬀect how and where chondrules form and accrete.
Finally, our current setup is local, that is, it is isolated
entirely from its surrounding. It is important to exam-
ine how the picture developed here can be aﬀected by the
presence of nearby planets such as Jupiter. These kind
of global simulations may show how our scenario could
favor or disfavor the Grand-tack scenario (Walsh et al.
2011), which proposes that a mixture of volatile-rich and
volatile-poor asteroids in the current asteroid belt may
have originated from gas-induced migration of Jupiter
and Saturn.

In the next few years, potential sample-return mis-
sions and laboratory studies should yield a broader and
deeper view of the history recorded in primitive aster-
oids. This will enable tests of the ideas that chondrules
formed through impact jetting, cooled in the asteroid
belt’s ambient magnetic ﬁeld, and were quickly swept up
by planetesimals with the aid of gas drag forces.
