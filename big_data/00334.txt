FINITE F-TYPE AND F-ABUNDANT MODULES

HAILONG DAO AND TONY SE

Dedicated to Professor Kei-ichi Watanabe on the occasion of his seventieth birthday

Abstract. In this note we introduce and study basic properties of two types of modules
over a commutative noetherian ring R of positive prime characteristic. The ﬁrst is the
category of modules of ﬁnite F -type. These objects include reﬂexive ideals representing
torsion elements in the divisor class group of R. The second class is what we call F -abundant
modules. These include, for example, the ring R itself and the canonical module when R
has positive splitting dimension. We prove various facts about these two categories and
how they are related, for example that HomR(M, N ) is maximal Cohen-Macaulay when M
is of ﬁnite F -type and N is F -abundant, plus some extra (but necessary) conditions. Our
methods allow us to extend previous results by Patakfalvi-Schwede, Yao and Watanabe.
They also aﬀord a deeper understanding of these objects, including complete classiﬁcations
in many cases of interest, such as complete intersections and invariant subrings.

1. Introduction

Let (R, m, k) be a reduced F -ﬁnite local ring of dimension d and prime characteristic
p > 0. Let α(R) = logp[k : kp]. All modules are in mod(R), the category of ﬁnitely
generated R-modules.

In this paper we prove some connections between two types of objects deﬁned using the

Frobenius endomorphism R → R with r 7→ rp.

These objects generalize some well-studied concepts. Let us start with the deﬁnitions. Fix
an R-module M. For e ∈ Z>0, let eM denote the abelian group M viewed as an R-module
via the eth iteration of the Frobenius map. We let F e : mod(R) → mod(R) denote the eth
Peskine-Szpiro functor given by

F e(M) := M ⊗R

eR.

Given S ⊆ mod(R), we use addR(S) to denote the additive subcategory of mod(R) generated
by S.

Deﬁnition 1.1. (1) Let M be an R-module such that Supp(M) = Spec R and is locally free
in codimension 1. We let M(e) = F e
R(M), viewed as an
R-module by identifying eR with R. We say that M is of ﬁnite F -type if {M(e)}e>0 ⊆
addR(X) for some R-module X (see Lemma 4.3). We let F T (R) denote the category of
R-modules of ﬁnite F -type.

(2) Let N, L be R-modules. Let be be maximum such that eN = L⊕be ⊕ Ne for some Ne. We

say that (N, L) is an abundant pair if lim inf e→∞ peα(R)/be = 0.

(3) Let L be an R-module. We say that L is an F -abundant module if (N, L) is an abundant

pair for some N.

Examples of modules of ﬁnite F -type include torsion elements of the divisor class group of
a normal domain R (without any assumption about the order of the element), ﬁnite integral
extensions that are ´etale in codimension one (see section 4), or F -periodic vector bundles on
the punctured spectrum of R (and of the corresponding projective variety X when R is a
local cone of some embedding of X; see section 6). For F -abundant modules, R has positive
splitting dimension if and only if (R, R) is an abundant pair (see section 5). A good source
of examples in both cases are the rings of invariants of a ﬁnite group, see Example 5.3.

Our main technical results (collected in section 3) say roughly that under various extra
conditions, if M is of ﬁnite F -type and N is F -abundant, then HomR(M, N) is maximal
Cohen-Macaulay. We shall give plenty of examples to show that the technical conditions are
necessary. Our approach yields a strengthening of some well-known results as well as many
new ones:
(1) An extension of results by Patakfalvi-Schwede ([18, Theorem 3.1]) and Watanabe ([21,
Corollary 2.9]) on depth of divisor classes associated to F -regular singularities. See
Theorem 6.3.

(2) Under certain conditions, a strong generalization of Yao’s result ([22, Lemma 2.2]) on

Cohen-Macaulayness of F -contributors. See Theorems 3.8 and 3.10.

(3) A complete classiﬁcation of the categories of ﬁnite F -type R-modules and abundant F -
modules in many cases of interest, such as complete intersections and invariant subrings
(Corollary 4.13, Theorem 4.14 and 5).

2. Notation and preliminary results

Deﬁnition 2.1. ([3, Deﬁnition 2.4] and [5, Deﬁnition 4.5]) Let ae = ae(R) be maximum
such that eR = R⊕ae ⊕ Re for some Re. The largest integer k such that

lim
e→∞

ae

pe(k+α(R)) > 0

is called the F -splitting dimension of R, and is denoted by sdim R.

Notation 2.2. (a) We use (Sk) to denote Serre’s criteria for k > 0.
(b) We use Hi

m(M) to denote the ith local cohomology module of an R-module M supported

on m.

(c) For an R-module M, we let M ∗ denote HomR(M, R).
(d) Suppose that R has a canonical module ωR. Then for an R-module M, we let M ∨

denote HomR(M, ωR).

(e) For S ⊆ R, we let eS to denote S viewed as a subset of eR. Then for P ∈ Spec R, Re

eP

(f) For an ideal I ⊆ R, an integer e > 0 and q = pe, we let I [q] = {xq | x ∈ I}, the qth

is an RP -module, and Re

eP = e(RP ).

Frobenius power of I.

(g) We use CM(R) to denote the subcategory of mod(R) consisting of all C-M R-modules

and Ref(R) the subcategory of all reﬂexive modules.

Remark 2.3. We would like to remind the reader of another characterization of sdim R. We
consider the splitting prime P(R) of R, as deﬁned in [3, Deﬁnition 3.2]. By [3, Theorem 3.3
and Corollary 3.4], P(R) is a prime ideal if sdim(R) 6= −∞ or the unit ideal otherwise.
Corollary 4.3 of [5] shows that sdim R = dim(R/P(R)) when sdim(R) 6= −∞.

Proposition 2.4. Assume the following for R:
(1) R is equidimensional;
(2) RP is C-M for all P ∈ Spec R \ {m}; and
(3) sdim R > 0.
Then R is C-M.

Proof. Since R is F -ﬁnite, it is a homomorphic image of a Gorenstein ring by [11, Remark
before Lemma A.2]. By (1) and (2), for 0 6 i < d we have that Hi
m(R) has ﬁnite length by
[1, Proposition 21.24]; see also [2, Theorem 9.5.2 (Grothendieck’s Finiteness Theorem)]. So

peα(R)λR(Hi

m(R) = 0 for 0 6 i < d. Then by [1,
(cid:3)

Corollary 2.5. If R is F -split, is C-M on Spec R \ {m} (e.g. R is an isolated singularity)
but not C-M, then sdim R = 0.
(cid:3)

Example 2.6. Let X be an ordinary Abelian variety of dimension at least two and R be the
coordinate ring of an embedding of X with respect to some polarization. It is well-known, as
in [15, 19], that R is F -split but not C-M. So by Corollary 2.5, sdim R = 0.

Lemma 2.7. Let M, N be R-modules such that eM = N be ⊕Me and lim inf e→∞
Then depth N > k. In particular, if k = dim(M), then N is C-M.

pe(k+α(R)) > 0.

Proof. We use the same proof as in [22, Lemma 2.2]. For 0 6 i < k, we have

0 = lim

as in Proposition 2.4. So Hi

R(x, N) = 0 for all 0 6 i < k, and hence depth N > k.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.8. It is already known that sdim R = d ⇒ R is strongly F -regular ⇒ R is C-M.

Remark 2.9. Let eM = Rbe ⊕ Me with be the largest possible. The largest integer k such
that

be

pe(k+α(R)) > 0

was deﬁned in [3, Deﬁnition 5.4] to be sdim(M), the s-dimension of M.

Deﬁnition 2.10. We will let (sdimn) to denote the statement: sdim RP > 0 for all P ∈
Spec R such that ht P > n.

Lemma 2.11. If R satisﬁes (sdimn), then ht P(R) < n.

Proof. Suppose that R satsiﬁes (sdimn). By [3, Proposition 3.6], we have P(RP(R)) =
P(R)RP(R). Since R is F -ﬁnite and reduced, so is RP(R). By [3, Corollary 3.4], since
P(RP(R)) is the maximal ideal of RP(R), we have sdim RP(R) = 0, so ht P(R) < n.
(cid:3)

3. Main technical results

Lemma 3.1. Let f : M → N be a homomorphism of R-modules, where M is (S2) and N is
(S1). Suppose that f is an isomorphism in codimension 1. Then f is an isomorphism.

Remark 3.2. In many of the results below, we can replace the assumption of a module being
locally free in codimension 1 by R being quasinormal.

Corollary 3.3. Let L, N be R-modules such that L is free in codimension 1 and N is (S2).
Then

HomR(L, N) ∼= HomR(L∗∗, N)

Proof. Let f : L → L∗∗ be the canonical map and f : HomR(L∗∗, N) → HomR(L, N) the
induced map. Then f is an isomorphism in codimension 1. By Lemma 3.1, it suﬃces to
show that HomR(M, N) is (S2) for every R-module M. Given M, let F1 → F0 → M → 0
be a ﬁnite presentation of M. Applying HomR(−, N) gives

0 → HomR(M, N) → HomR(F0, N) → HomR(F1, N)

Since N is (S2), so are HomR(Fi, N) for i = 1, 2 and HomR(M, N), as required.

(cid:3)

Corollary 3.4. Suppose that R is C-M with a canonical module ωR. Suppose that M is (S2)
and M ∨ is MCM. Then M is MCM.

Proof. Consider the natural map f : M → M ∨∨. In codimension 1, M is MCM since it is
(S2), so f is an isomorphism. Since M ∨ is MCM, so is M ∨∨. Hence f is an isomorphism by
Lemma 3.1.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.5. Let M be an R-module, f : R → S be a ring homomorphism, U be a mul-
tiplicative subset of S and T = f −1(U). Then we have (M ⊗R S)U = M ⊗R S ⊗S SU =
M ⊗R SU = M ⊗R RT ⊗RT SU = MT ⊗RT SU .

f1−→ R1

f2−→ R2 be a sequence of ring homomorphisms where R2 is (S2).
Lemma 3.6. Let R
Let f = f2 ◦ f1. Let M be an R-module. Suppose that MP is free for every P ∈ Spec R of
height 1 and for every P = f −1(Q) such that Q ∈ Spec R2 of height 1. Let Mi = (M ⊗R Ri)∗∗
(over Ri) for i = 1, 2. Then (M1 ⊗R1 R2)∗∗ ∼= M2.

P1 ⊗(R1)P1

(R2)Q = (MP ⊗RP (R1)P1)∗∗ ⊗(R1)P1

Proof. Let N = M ⊗R R1. The natural map N → M1 = N ∗∗ gives rise to a map g : M ⊗R
R2 = M ⊗R R1 ⊗R1 R2 = N ⊗R1 R2 → N ∗∗ ⊗R1 R2 = M1 ⊗R1 R2. Let Q ∈ Spec R2,
P1 = (f2)−1(Q) and P = f −1(Q). Then (M ⊗R R2)Q = MP ⊗RP (R2)Q and (M1 ⊗R1 R2)Q =
(M ⊗R R1)∗∗
(R2)Q, so g is an isomorphism in
codimension 1. Applying ∗∗ gives the map M2 = (M ⊗R R2)∗∗ → (M1 ⊗R1 R2)∗∗, which is an
isomorphism by Lemma 3.1 since R2 is (S2).
(cid:3)
Corollary 3.7. (“Index shifting”) Let R be (S2) and M be as in Deﬁnition 1.1. Let e, f be
nonnegative integers. Then [M(e)](f ) ∼= M(e + f ).
Proof. Let R1 = eR and R2 =
[M(e)](f ) = (M1 ⊗R1 R2)∗∗ ∼= M2 = M(e + f ).
Theorem 3.8. Suppose that R is (S2) and equidimensional. Let M, N be R-modules such
that M ∈ F T (R) and N is (S2). Assume that (N, L) is an abundant pair and that
NP ∈ add LP for all P ∈ Spec R such that 3 6 ht(P ) < d. Assume further that for ev-
ery P ∈ Spec R such that 3 6 ht(P ) < d and e > 0, (HomR(M(e), L))P is MCM. Then
HomR(M(e), L) is MCM for all e > 0.
Proof. If d 6 2, then HomR(M(e), L) is MCM since L is (S2). So we may assume that
d > 3. By assumption, for P ∈ Spec R \ {m}, we have NP ∈ add LP for ht(P ) > 3, so
(HomR(M(e), N))P is MCM for e > 0. So for 0 6 i < d and e > 0, Hi
m(HomR(M(e), N))
has ﬁnite length — see Proposition 2.4. By Corollary 3.3, we have

as in Lemma 3.6. Then we have M(e) = M1, and so

By Corollary 3.7, we have [M(e)](f ) ∼= M(e+ f ). So we may replace M by M(e) to conclude
that HomR(M(e), L) is MCM.

Remark 3.9. By Lemma 4.3, we only need to check that (HomR(Mi, L))P is MCM for 3 6
ht(P ) < d for the ﬁnitely many indecomposable modules Mi that appear among {M(e)}e>0.

Theorem 3.10. Let R be as in Theorem 3.8. Let M, N be R-modules such that M ∈ F T (R)
and N is (S2). Assume that for every P ∈ Spec R such that ht(P ) > 3, (NP , LP ) is an
abundant pair. Assume further that for every P ∈ Spec R such that 3 6 ht(P ) < d, we have
NP ∈ add LP . Then HomR(M(e), L) is MCM for all e > 0.

Proof. First, for every P ∈ Spec R, we have the following.

So we can prove by induction on d that HomR(M(e), L) is MCM for all e > 0. We may as-
sume that d > 3. Let P ∈ Spec R such that 3 6 ht(P ) < d. By induction, (HomR(M(e), L))P
is MCM. So by Theorem 3.8, HomR(M(e), L) is MCM.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.11. Suppose that R is C-M and M ∈ F T (R) is (S2). Assume that:
(a) either sdim R > 0 and M(e)P is MCM for every P ∈ Spec R such that 3 6 ht(P ) < d

and e > 0; or
(b) R is (sdim3).
Then M is MCM.

Proof. Since R is a homomorphic image of a Gorenstein ring, it has a canonical module ωR
by [2, 12.1.3(iii)]. Since R is C-M, it is equidimensional, and ωR is reﬂexive and hence (S2).
We will show that HomR(M, ωR) = M ∨ is MCM, so that by Corollary 3.4, M is MCM. We
may assume that d > 2. Since sdim R > 0, (R, R) is an abundant pair by Example 5.1. Then
∼= HomR(eR, ωR) = HomR(R⊕ae ⊕ Re, ωR) =
(ωR, ωR) is also an abundant pair, since ωeR
ω⊕ae
R ⊕ HomR(Re, ωR). If (a) holds, then (HomR(M(e), ωR))P is MCM for every P ∈ Spec R
such that 3 6 ht(P ) < d and e > 0. By Theorem 3.8, HomR(M, ωR) = M ∨ is MCM. If
(b) holds, then (ωRP , ωRP ) is an abundant pair for P ∈ Spec R such that ht(P ) > 3, so
HomR(M, ωR) is MCM by Theorem 3.10.
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.12. Suppose that R is strongly F -regular and M ∈ F T (R) is (S2). Then M
is MCM. In particular, if I is a reﬂexive ideal such that [I] is torsion in Cl(R), then I is
MCM.

Proof. Since R is strongly F -regular, it is (sdim3). Corollary 3.11 shows that M is MCM.
By Example 4.1, we have I ∈ F T (R).
(cid:3)

Remark 3.13. Corollary 3.12 generalizes [18, Corollary 3.3].

4. The category of finite F -type modules

In this section we study the category of ﬁnite F -type in more detail. We completely classify
this category when R is a quotient singularity with a ﬁnite group whose order is coprime
to p (Corollary 4.12), or when R is a complete intersection that is regular in codimension 2
(Theorem 4.14).

Example 4.1. The following are R-modules M of ﬁnite F -type.
(a) ([21, paragraph 2.3]) R is a normal domain and M = I, where I is a divisorial ideal.
Then M(e) ∼= I (e), so M ∈ F T (R) iﬀ [I] is torsion in Cl(R).
(a’) M is a free R-module.
(b) ([21, Theorem 2.7]) Let R → S be a ﬁnite homomorphism of normal domains which
eR → eS we get
is ´etale in codimension 1 and M = S. From the natural map S ⊗R
(S ⊗R
(c) See also Lemma 6.2.

eR)∗∗ ∼= S ∗∗, i.e. M(e) ∼= S.

Lemma 4.2. F T (R) is closed under direct sums and direct summands.

Proof. Obvious.

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.3. Let S ⊆ mod R. Then addR(S) has ﬁnitely many indecomposable objects iﬀ
S ⊆ addR(X) for some R-module X. Hence for an R-module M, M ∈ F T (R) if and only
if only ﬁnitely many indecomposable direct summands appear among {M(e)}e>0.

Proof. For the “only if” part, take X to be the direct sum of the indecomposable objects of
addR(S). For the “if” part, we consider the endomorphism ring E = EndR(X). Consider the
category Proj E ⊆ mod(E) of left projective modules over E. Then F : addR(X) → Proj E
given by F (L) = HomR(L, X) for L ∈ addR(X) is an equivalence of categories. Since
E is ﬁnitely generated over the local ring R, it is semilocal. By [8, Theorem 9], Proj E
has only ﬁnitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects, and hence so does
addR(X).
(cid:3)

Corollary 4.4. Let R, M be as in Corollary 3.7. Then M ∈ F T (R) iﬀ there are e > 0 and
f > 0 such that M(e) ∼= M(e + f ).
Proof. “If”: We note that M(e + g) ∼= [M(e)](g) ∼= [M(e + f )](g) ∼= M(e + f + g) by
Corollary 3.7, so there are only ﬁnitely many isomorphism classes of {M(e)}e>0.
“Only if”: Let X be an R-module such that {M(e)}e>0 ⊆ addR(X). Let S be the set of
indecomposable direct summands of {M(e)}e>0. Then S ⊆ addR(X), and S is ﬁnite by
Lemma 4.3. By index shifting, it suﬃces to prove that N(e) ∼= N(e + f ) for some e > 0 and
f > 0 for all N ∈ S. By assumption, R is local, so we can prove the claim by induction on
the minimum number of generators of N. Suppose ﬁrst that N(e) is indecomposable for all
e. Then the claim holds since S is ﬁnite. So suppose that N(e0) is not indecomposable for
some e0 and has indecomposable direct summands Ni ∈ S. By induction, the claim holds
for the Ni, and hence for N by index shifting.
(cid:3)

Proposition 4.5. Let R be (S2). Let F T = F T (R). Then:
(a) if M ∈ F T , then M ∗∗ ∈ F T .
(b) if M, N ∈ F T , then M ⊗ N ∈ F T .

Proof. (a) By Corollary 3.7, we have [M(0)](e) ∼= M(e), that is, (M ∗∗)(e) ∼= M(e).
(b) For P ∈ Spec R, we have (M ⊗R N)P = MP ⊗RP NP , so M ⊗ N is locally free in
codimension 1. Next, we have

Question 4.6. If R is Gorenstein, is M ∗ ∈ F T (R)?

Lemma 4.7. Let f : R → S be a ring homomorphism. Suppose that S is (S2). Let M be an
R-module. Suppose that:
(a) f is ﬂat; or
(b) MP is free for every P = f −1(Q) such that Q ∈ Spec S and ht(Q) = 1.
If M ∈ F T (R), then M ⊗R S ∈ F T (S).

Proof. Let N = M ⊗R S. First, we consider (b) and suppose that Q ∈ Spec S, ht(Q) = 1
and M ∈ F T (R). Let P = f −1(Q). Then NQ = MP ⊗RP SQ, which is free over SQ by
assumption. Next, we consider the modules F e

Now suppose that f is ﬂat. Let Q, P and M be as above. Then we have ht(Q) = ht(P ) +
dim(SQ/P SQ), so ht(P ) 6 1 and MP is free, giving (b).

Lemma 4.8. Suppose that R is regular. Let M be an R-module. Then M ∗ is reﬂexive.

Proof. Consider the canonical map f : M ∗ → M ∗∗∗. In codimension 1, R is a principal ideal
domain, so M ∗ is free, and f is an isomorphism. Since R is (S2), so are M ∗ and M ∗∗∗. By
Lemma 3.1, f is an isomorphism.

Lemma 4.9. Let R → S be a ﬂat ring extension. Suppose that M is a reﬂexive R-module.
Then M ⊗R S is a reﬂexive S-module.

Proof. Since R → S is ﬂat, we have M ⊗R S = M ∗∗ ⊗R S = (M ⊗R S)∗∗.

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.10. Suppose that R is regular. Consider the following statements:
(a) M ∈ F T (R)
(b) M ∗ is free.
(c) M ∗∗ is free.
Then (a) ⇒ (b) ⇔ (c). If M is free in codimension 1, then (a) ⇔ (b) ⇔ (c).

Proof. (b) ⇒ (c): Obvious.
(c) ⇒ (b): If M ∗∗ is free, then so is M ∗∗∗ = (M ∗)∗∗. So M ∗ is free by Lemma 4.8.
(a) ⇒ (c): Suppose that M ∈ F T (R). By Proposition 4.5(a) and Lemma 3.1, we may
replace M by M ∗∗ and assume that M is reﬂexive. So we need to show that M is free.
Since R is regular, the ring extension R → eR is ﬂat. By Lemma 4.9, we have M(e) =
eR for all e > 0. By Corollary 4.4, we have M(e′) ∼= M(e′ + e) for
(M ⊗R
some e′ > 0 and e > 0. First, suppose that e′ = 0, so that M ∼= M(e). Consider a minimal
free resolution

eR)∗∗ = M ⊗R

· · · → F1

A−→ F0 → M → 0

of M given by the matrix A. Let I(M) ⊆ m be the Fitting ideal of M generated by the
entries of A and let q = pe. Tensoring with eR gives a free resolution

A[q]
−−→ F0 → M(e) → 0,

· · · → F1

(∗)
so I(M(e)) = I(M)[q]. Since M ∼= M(e), we have I(M) = I(M(e)) = I(M)[q], so I(M) =
I(M)q. By Nakayama’s Lemma, we have I(M) = 0. So A = 0, and M ∗∗ = M is free.
In general, the above shows that M(e) is free for some e > 0 by Corollary 3.7. Suppose that
e > 0. Since (∗) is a free resolution of the free module M(e), it is a direct sum of a trivial
complex and the resolution 0 → F → M(e) → 0. So the entries in A[q] are either 1 or 0.
Since A has entries in m and R is a domain, we must have A = 0, so again M is free.
(c) ⇒ (a): Suppose that M is free in codimension 1. If M ∗∗ is free, then M ∗∗ ∈ F T (R), so
M ∈ F T (R) by Proposition 4.5(a).
(cid:3)

Theorem 4.11. Let ϕ : R → S be a ﬁnite homomorphism of normal domains such that
ϕ is ´etale in codimension 1 and splits as a map of R-modules. Let N, L be R-modules
such that N is (S2) and that locally, (N, L) is an abundant pair and N ∈ add(L). Then
L ∈ addR(CM(S)).

Proof. Since S is of ﬁnite F -type over R, HomR(S, L) is C-M by Theorem 3.10, so HomR(S, L)
∈ CM(S). Since ϕ splits, L is a direct summand of HomR(S, L).
(cid:3)

Corollary 4.12. Let ϕ : R → S be a ﬁnite homomorphism of normal domains such that ϕ is
´etale in codimension 1 and splits as a map of R-modules and that S is regular (for example,
if R is a quotient singularity as in example 5.3). If M ∈ F T (R), then M ∗ ∈ addR(S). If
S ∗ = HomR(S, R) ∼= S (again, for example if R is a quotient singularity as in 5.3) then
F T (R) = addR(S).

Proof. Let N = M ⊗RS. If M ∈ F T (R), then N ∈ F T (S) by Lemma 4.7. Then N ∗ is free by
Lemma 4.10. We have N ∗ = HomS(M ⊗R S, S) = HomR(M, HomS(S, S)) = HomR(M, S).
Since f splits, HomR(M, R) is a direct summand of HomR(M, S), so M ∗ ∈ addR(S).
If
S ∗ ∼= S, then it follows that F T (R) ⊆ addR(S), and S ∈ F T (R) by Example 4.1.
(cid:3)

Corollary 4.13. Suppose that k is algebraically closed. Let S = k[[x1, . . . , xd]]. Let G be
a ﬁnite subgroup of GL(d, k) that contains no pseudo-reﬂections such that the order of G is
coprime to p. Let R = SG. Then F T (R) = addR S.

Proof. Use Corollary 4.12.

(cid:3)

Theorem 4.14. Suppose that R is a complete intersection and M is an R-module that is
free in codimension 2. Then M ∈ F T (R) if and only if M ∗∗ is free.

Proof. The proof of “if” is given by (c) ⇒ (a) in Lemma 4.10. For the “only if” part, as
in the proof of Lemma 4.10 (a) ⇒ (c), it suﬃces to assume that M is reﬂexive and show
that M is free. The proof is by induction on d. For d > 3, M is free on Spec R \ {m} by
induction. Let r = depth M > 2. Suppose that r < d. Then by [7, Proposition 4.14], we
have Hr

m(F e

R(M)∗∗) = eHr

R(M)) ∼= Hr
λR(Hr
m(F e

pe(d+α(R))

m(M(e)) as in Theorem 3.8, so

λR(eHr

= lim
e→∞

pe(d+α(R))

= lim
e→∞

m(M(e)))

= 0

pe(d+α(R))

by the assumption that M ∈ F T (R). Then [7, Theorem 4.12] gives pdR M < d − r. By the
Auslander-Buchsbaum formula, we have depth M > r, a contradiction. So r = d, and again
[7, Theorem 4.12] with k = r − 1 shows that pdR M = 0, so M is free.
(cid:3)
Example 4.15. Let R = k[[x, y, z]]/(xy − z2) and M be the ideal (x, z). Then [M] has order
2 in Cl(R) and so M ∈ F T (R) by Example 4.1, but M ∗∗ is not free, so the condition that
M is locally free in codimension 2 is necessary in Theorem 4.14.

5. F -abundant pairs and modules

In this section we give many examples of F -abundant pairs and modules.

Example 5.1. (a) If sdim R > 1, in particular if R is strongly F -regular of dimension > 1,
then (R, R) is an abundant pair.
(b) [14, Proposition 2.3] shows that α(RP ) = α(R) + dim(R/P ). Let N, L be as in Def-
If lim inf e→∞ pe(α(R)+dim(R/P ))/be = 0, then (NP , LP ) is an
inition 1.1 and P ∈ Spec R.
abundant pair.
(c) F -contributors for modules of ﬁnite F -representation type, as in [22, Section 2].

Example 5.2. ([7, Example 6.1]) Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic
p > 2. Consider the hypersurface R = k[[x, y, u, v]]/(xy − uv). Then every MCM R-module
is F -abundant.

Example 5.3. Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic p > 0 and V be a k-
vector space of dimension d. Let S be the symmetric algebra of V . Let G be a ﬁnite subgroup
of GL(V ) without pseudo-reﬂections such that |G| is coprime to p. Let R = SG be the ring
of invariants. Let V0, · · · , Vn be a complete set of irreducible representations of G over k.

FINITE F -TYPE AND F -ABUNDANT MODULES

11

Let Mi = (S ⊗k Vi)G. It is classical that addR(S) = {M0, M1, . . . , Mn}. Also, by the main
results of [10]:
(1) S, and hence all of M0, M1, . . . , Mn, are modules of ﬁnite F -type. Note that rank Mi =

dimk Vi, so we have many examples of modules of ﬁnite F -type which are not ideals.

(2) (Mi, Mj) is an F -abundant pair for all 0 ≤ i, j ≤ n.

Corollary 5.4. Let R, N be as in Theorem 3.8. Suppose that lim inf e→∞ pe(α(R)+d−3)/be = 0
as in Example 5.1 with N = L (for example, when d = 3 and (N, N) is an abundant pair).
Then N is MCM. In particular, if R is regular, then N is free.

Proof. Theorem 3.10 with M = R and e = 0 shows that N is MCM.

(cid:3)

Example 5.5. Let k be a perfect ﬁeld, R = k[[x, y, z]] and M be the ideal (x, y). Then
(M, M) is an abundant pair, but M is not (S2). So the assumption in Corollary 5.4 for N
to be (S2) cannot be weakened.

Proof. Let C = k[[z]]. Consider the exact sequence

0 → M → R → C → 0

Let q = pe. Since e− is an exact functor, we have

0

/ eM

/ eR

/ eC

R⊕q3

/ C ⊕q

/ 0

/ 0

It follows that eM has exactly q copies of M, so (M, M) is an abundant pair. Since 1 =
depth MM < dim MM = 2, M is not (S2).
(cid:3)

Example 5.6. Let k be a perfect ﬁeld, R = k[[x1, x2, . . . , xd−3, u, v, w]], C = R/(u, v, w) and
M = Ω2C, the second syzygy of C. Then M is (S2) and (M, M) is an abundant pair. So
the assumptions in Corollary 5.4 cannot be weakened.

Proof. Let q = pe. Then as in Example 5.5, we have

0

/ eM

/ e(R3)

/ eR

/ eC

R⊕3qd

/ R⊕qd

/ C ⊕qd−3

/ 0

/ 0

It follows that eM has exactly qd−3 copies of M. Then as in Corollary 5.4, we have
lim inf e→∞ q(α(R)+d−3)/be = qd−3/qd−3 = 1. Since M is a second syzygy, it is (S2). Since
depth C = d − 3, we have depth M = d − 1 6= d, so M is not free.
(cid:3)

6. Geometric applications

Discussion 6.0. Let (A, m) be a standard graded ring that is (S2) of dimension at least 2. We
ﬁrst ﬁx some notation and record some results from [9, 16]. Let R = Am. Let X = Proj(A),
Y = Spec(R) \ {mm} and Z = Spec(R). Let ι : Y → Z be the inclusion morphism. There

is also an aﬃne surjective morphism π : Y → X ([16, Proposition I.5]). Corollary I.6 of [16]
states that for every A-graded module M we have sheaf cohomology isomorphisms

⊕d∈ZH i(X, fM (d))

≃

−→ H i(Y,gMm|Y )

for i > 0. For 1 6 i 6 d − 1, we have H i(Y,gMm|Y ) ∼= H i+1

Let V (·) denote the category of vector bundles over a scheme. Let Γ be the global section
functor. If G ∈ V (Y ), then ι∗G is a coherent OZ-module. Let ψ = Γ ◦ π∗. Then we have
maps

m (Mm).

V (X) π∗

−→ V (Y ) Γ−→ {M ∈ Ref(R) | M is locally free on Y }

By [9, Theorem 1.3], depth Γ(G ) > 2. Γ satisﬁes the property Γ(G1 ⊗ G2) = (Γ(G1) ⊗R
Γ(G2))∗∗. Let Fi ∈ V (X), i = 1, 2, be indecomposable such that ψ(Fi) are isomorphic up
to free summand. Then by [9, Proposition 9.5], F1

∼= F2(m) = F2 ⊗ OX(m) for some m.

Deﬁnition 6.1. ([4, Introduction]) Let X be a smooth projective variety deﬁned over a
ﬁeld k of characteristic p > 0. Let ϕ : X → X be the absolute Frobenius morphism. Then a
vector bundle F ∈ V (X) is (e, f )-Frobenius periodic, or (e, f )-F periodic in short, if there
are e < f such that (ϕe)∗(F ) ∼= (ϕf )∗(F ).
Lemma 6.2. Suppose that F ∈ V (X) is (e, f )-F periodic. Let X, Y be as in 6.0. Let
M = ψ(F ). Then F is (e1, e2)-F periodic iﬀ M(e1) ∼= M(e2).
Proof. For “only if”, we have ψ(cid:0)(ϕe)∗(F )(cid:1) = ψ(F ⊗ (ϕe)∗(X)) = (cid:0)ψ(F ) ⊗ (ϕe)∗(X)(cid:1)∗∗

M(e) as in 6.0. The “if” part comes from sheaﬁﬁcation.

(cid:3)

Next, we discuss a generalization of one of the results in [18, Theorem 3.1]. For that we
need to recall some notation. Let R be a F -ﬁnite normal domain and let D be a Q-divisor.
In the next result we are able to remove the condition that the characteristic p is coprime
to r as in [18, Theorem 3.1]. We follow the same trick as in [18], with a crucial diﬀerence
suggested by our approach in this paper: the reﬂexive module representing a torsion element
in the class group has ﬁnite F -type.

Theorem 6.3. Let R be an F -ﬁnite normal domain with perfect residue ﬁeld and X =
Spec R. Let ∆ be a Q-divisor on X such that the pair (X, ∆) is strongly F -regular. Let D
be an integral divisor such that rD ∼ r∆′ for some integer r > 0 and 0 ≤ ∆′ ≤ ∆. Then
OX(−D) is Cohen-Macaulay.
Proof. Since we also have that the pair (X, ∆′) is strongly F -regular, one may assume ∆′ =
∆. Now, this assumption implies that there is a decomposition of R-modules (q = pe) ([5,
Lemma 3.5]):

F e

∗

OX((q − 1)∆) = O ne

X ⊕ Ne

such that lim inf e→∞

ne
qd > 0. Twisting by OX(−D), reﬂexifying, we get a decomposition:
F e

OX((q − 1)(∆ − D) − D) = OX(−D)ne ⊕ N ′
e

∗

The key point now is that as r(∆ − D) ∼ 0, there are only ﬁnitely many isomorphism classes
of the modules OX((q − 1)(∆ − D) − D). Let M be the direct sum of all these modules and
I = OX(−D), what we have is precisely:

eM ∼= I ne ⊕ Pe

FINITE F -TYPE AND F -ABUNDANT MODULES

with lim inf e→∞

ne
qd > 0. Lemma 2.7 now forces I to be Cohen-Macaulay.
