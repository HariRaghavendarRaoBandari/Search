Abstract: We study the cusp anomalous dimension in N = 6 ABJ(M) theory, identifying
a scaling limit in which the ladder diagrams dominate. The resummation is encoded into
a Bethe-Salpeter equation that is mapped to a Schroedinger problem, exactly solvable due
to the surprising supersymmetry of the eﬀective Hamiltonian. In the ABJ case the solution
implies the diagonalization of the U (N ) and U (M ) building blocks, suggesting the existence
of two independent cusp anomalous dimensions and an unexpected exponentiation struc-
ture for the related Wilson loops. While consistent with previous perturbative analysis,
the strong coupling limit of our result does not agree with the string theory computation,
emphasizing a diﬀerence with the analogous resummation in the N = 4 case.

1 Introduction and summary of the results

The duality between N = 6 Super Chern-Simons theory with matter (also known as
ABJ(M) theory [1, 2]) and string theory on AdS4 × CP3 represents one the most inter-
esting possibilities to explore AdS/CFT correspondence beyond the original paradigm.
Although it seems to share many similarities with the cousin N = 4 Super Yang-Mills
theory in four dimensions, there are still many aspects calling for a better comprehension.

Supersymmetric Wilson loops, in particular, provide a rich class of BPS observables [3]-[9]
that can be computed exactly through localization technique in the simplest situations [10].
While their quantum behavior is still rather mysterious in the general case [11], the well-
understood 1/2 BPS and 1/6 BPS circles exhibit an intriguing non-trivial interpolation
between weak and strong coupling regime [12]-[15]. A careful study of the relevant matrix
models [15] has also unveiled a variety of phenomena of string/M-theory origin [16]-[18].
This contrasts with the relative simplicity of N = 4 SYM, where a gaussian matrix model
[19, 20] describes exactly the dynamics of 1/2 BPS Wilson loops [21].

Wilson loops are also relevant in gauge theories (supersymmetric or not) because they
encode important properties of scattering amplitudes and infrared radiation: the cusp
anomalous dimension Γ(ϕ), originally introduced in [22] as the ultraviolet divergence of
a Wilson loop with Euclidean cusp angle ϕ, appears in fact in many interesting physical
situations. It was computed in QCD to two-loop order in [23] and, in light-like limit ϕ →
i∞, provides crucial universal informations [24]. In supersymmetric theories Γ(ϕ) is not a
BPS observable, making its exact computation in N = 4 SYM a diﬃcult challenge. In the
light-like limit [25] integrability controls its all-order behavior through an integral equation,
whose solution matches both weak coupling expansions [26] and string computations at the
strong coupling [27]. In the general case a strategy [28, 29] for computing Γ(ϕ) was later
proposed (see [30–32] for the original introduction of the related TBA approach in the case
of local operators). The cusp anomalous dimension can be generalized including an R-
symmetry angle θ that distinguishes the coupling of the scalars to the two halves of the cusp
[38]. The new observable Γ(ϕ, θ) interpolates between BPS conﬁgurations and generalized
quark-antiquark potentials. Exact equations can be written applying integrability and they
have been checked successfully at three loops [28, 39]. In the near-BPS limit it is possible to
use localization to obtain the exact form of the so-called Bremsstrahlung function [40, 41],
that has been later directly recovered from the TBA equations [42, 43].

As anticipated before, even for the simple circular 1/2 BPS Wilson loop the weak/strong
interpolation for ABJ(M) theory is not non-trivial. Integrability itself has been explored
here in a somehow limited range of situations [44]-[48]: when established it still depends
on an elusive interpolating function, h(λ) [49]-[51]. Recently a proposal for the functional
form of h(λ) has been advanced [52] and checked at two-loop level in string theory [53],
under suitable assumptions. Alternatively h(λ) could be determined by computing exactly
some quantity by integrability and confronting with the same calculation by localization
(or by other QFT techniques in which unknown functions are absent). A natural candidate
would be the ABJM Bremsstrahlung function, for which all order proposals exist [54], but
integrability has not been yet applied to its determination.

For this reason we think it is important to study Γ(ϕ, θ) in N = 6 Super Chern-Simons
theory: it would be useful to obtain exact QFT results to be compared with the integrability
approach and, at strong coupling, with string theory. Γ(ϕ, θ) has been introduced in
ABJ(M) theory in [55], where its computation at two-loop has been presented and its
exponentiation properties discussed. The two halves of the cusp are locally 1/2 BPS and

– 2 –

therefore couple also directly to the fermions of the theory, as originally discovered in [7],
and not only to the gauge connections and scalars. The resulting cusped Wilson loop is
not globally supersymmetric and its exact evaluation seems very challenging. Fortunately,
the analogous system in N = 4 SYM can be tackled in a particular limit through Feynman
diagrams resummation. In [39] a new scaling limit involving the complexiﬁed angle θ was
introduced,

λ (cid:28) 1,

ˆλ = λ exp(iθ/4) ﬁxed.

iθ (cid:29) 1,

(1.1)
Here λ = g2N is the ’t Hooft coupling of N = 4 SYM. In this limit the leading order
contribution is simply given by ladder diagrams, where the rungs are made by scalar
exchanges. The ladder diagrams can be summed up eﬃciently using a Bethe-Salpeter
equation, solved exactly in the small ϕ limit. The strong coupling behavior has been
also examined, ﬁnding agreement with the corresponding string theory calculation [39].
Later it was also performed an analysis at next-to-leading order, generalizing the original
Bethe-Salpeter equation and computing the relevant corrections at strong coupling [56].
Remarkably these corrections have been also obtained from string theory and successfully
compared each other. As repeatedly stressed in the original analysis [39], the matching of
the strong coupling limit of the Bethe-Salpeter solution with the string theory computation
is quite surprising. The ladders limit, λ → 0 with ˆλ ﬁxed, is diﬀerent from the strong
coupling limit λ → ∞ with iθ (cid:29) 1 ﬁxed and the result could, in principle, depend on their
order: nevertheless they agree at leading and subleading level.

In this paper we consider a similar limit in three-dimensional ABJ(M) theory,

obtaining some exact results for Γ(ϕ, ˆλi). Here λ1 = N
k are the ’t Hooft couplings
of the ABJ(M) theory with gauge group U (N )⊗ U (M ), while k is the Chern-Simons level.
The presence of fermionic couplings to the cusped loop inherits a surprising supersymmetric
structure in the relevant Bethe-Salpeter equation. More precisely, the eﬀective Schroedinger
problem, associated to the integral equation that resums planar diagrams in N = 6 Super
Chern-Simons, enjoys an unexpected quantum mechanical supersymmetry. Because only
the ground state matters in determining Γ(ϕ, ˆλi) [39], supersymmetry produces an exact
expression for any value of the opening angle ϕ. This is in sharp contrast with the N = 4
case, where an analytic solution for the Bethe-Salpeter equation exists only at ϕ = 0 (that
in this case is the only supersymmetric point of the associated Schroedinger equation [39]).

In the ABJM case (N = M ) we get a very simple solution: Γ(ϕ, ˆλ) is exact at one-loop level,
as in an abelian theory. The delicate balance between bosonic and fermionic contributions,
encoded into the eﬀective supersymmetric quantum mechanics, exponentiates without non-
abelian correction the one-loop term. As a matter of fact we do not observe any transition
between a weak-coupling and a strong-coupling regime and we cannot match our result
with semiclassical computations in string theory, suggesting that it should exist a problem
with the order of limits in this case.

– 3 –

In the ABJ case (N (cid:54)= M ) the story is even more intriguing: the Bethe-Salpeter equa-
tion reduces to two coupled integral equations, resumming contributions from the upper
(N × N ) and the lower (M × M ) blocks of the holonomy of the U (N|M ) superconnection
deﬁning the Wilson loop [7]. By diagonalizing the system we end up with a two-dimensional
supersymmetric Schroedinger equation. From the knowledge of its ground state energy and
wave-function we reconstruct the original cusped Wilson loops. This works in full general-
ity in three dimensions with explicit UV an IR cut-oﬀs on the lines, while using dimensional
regularization we get an explicit solution only for ϕ = 0. The main result of our investiga-
tion is that, in the ABJ case, the original cusped Wilson loop, the trace of the holonomy
of the superconnection deﬁned in [7], does not renormalize multiplicatively but it mixes,
at quantum level, with the supertrace. As a consequence we end up with two indepen-
dent cusp anomalous dimensions, related to the renormalization constants of the operator
eigenstates (with respect to the mixing). On the other hand we could have expected this
fact from the very beginning: taking the trace of the holonomy of the superconnection is
required to preserve the global supersymmetry of the 1/2 BPS Wilson loop [7], In our case
supersymmetry is generically broken and we observe a mixing between the trace and (say)
the supertrace. Again the cusp anomalous dimensions are exact at one-loop level

cusp:

The paper is structured in the following way: in Section 2 we introduce the cusped Wil-
son loop in ABJ(M) theory as the trace of a superconnection, following [55]. The limit
in which the ladder diagrams dominate is described in Section 3, where we also discuss
how to derive the cusp anomalous dimensions both in the explicit cut-oﬀ scheme and in
dimensional regularization. In Section 4 we derive the relevant Bethe-Salpeter equation
and, after diagonalization, we obtain the associated Schroedinger equation. We solve the
supersymmetric Schroedinger equations for generic opening angle ϕ, in the cut-oﬀ scheme,
and for ϕ = 0 in dimensional regularization. In Section 5 we obtain the cusp anomalous
dimensions at leading order and discuss the operator mixing for the cusped Wilson loops.
Our conclusions and the future directions to improve our results appear in Section 6. Two
appendices complete our presentation.

2 The 1/2 BPS generalized cusped Wilson line in ABJ(M) theory

In this Section we review the construction of supersymmetric Wilson lines in ABJ(M)
theory [7]. In d = 3 the generalized gauge connection can be deﬁned in two diﬀerent ways
according to the degree of preserved supersymmetry.
Indeed, we can consider a purely

– 4 –

bosonic gauge connection whose holonomy is, for a suitable choice of the path, 1/6 BPS.
On the other hand, adding on the lines local couplings to the fermions, we can interpret
the Wilson operator as the holonomy of a U (N|M ) superconnection obtaining, for the
inﬁnite straight line, a 1/2 BPS operator. Its peculiar structure was also investigated via
the so-called Higgsing procedure which gives a physical explanation for the appearance of
the superconnection [8].

2.1 The 1/2 BPS Wilson line

In ABJ(M) theory the gauge sector consists of two gauge ﬁelds (Aµ) j
belonging
respectively to the adjoint of U (N ) and U (M ). The matter sector contains the complex
ﬁelds (CI ) ˆi
i . The ﬁelds (C, ¯ψ) transform
in the (N, ¯M) of the gauge group U (N )× U (M ) while the ﬁelds ( ¯C, ψ) live in the ( ¯N, M).

The form of L is determined mainly by dimensional analysis and symmetry properties of
the ﬁelds. In d = 3 the scalars have classical dimension 1/2, so they could only appear as
bilinears, which are in the adjoint and therefore enter in the diagonal blocks together with
the gauge ﬁelds. Instead the fermions have dimension 1 and should appear linearly. Since
they transform in the bifundamental, they are naturally placed in the oﬀ-diagonal entries
of the matrix.

For a given a path C, it is possible to compute the holonomy of the superconnection (2.1)

W [C] ≡ P exp(cid:18)−i(cid:90)C

L(τ )dτ(cid:19).

(2.2)

When the contour is a straight-line S, all the couplings can be chosen to be independent of τ ,
i.e. constant, in order to preserve the invariance under translations along the line. Further
restrictions on scalar and fermionic couplings follow from R−symmetry and supersymmetry
requirements. Actually, imposing δsusyL(τ ) = 0 gives rise to loop operators which are
merely bosonic (η = ¯η = 0) and at most 1/6 BPS [11]. The weaker condition of invariance
under supersymmetry up to a super-gauge transformation brings out the 1/2 BPS solution.
For (ﬁnite) closed path one has to carefully consider the boundary conditions obeyed by the
gauge functions to obtain a (super-)gauge invariant object. For instance, in the circle case

– 5 –

one has to take the trace of (2.2). For an inﬁnite open circuit, such as the straight line, the
naive statement that the ﬁelds vanish when τ = ±∞ allows two possible supersymmetric
operators

(2.3)

Usually one mainly considers the second possibility, since, for particular angles, it is con-
nected through a conformal transformation to a BPS closed loop [55]. Nevertheless the
supertraced holonomy has a crucial role as well.

2.2 The generalized cusp

The quantum holonomy of the super-connection L in a representation R of the supergroup
U (N|M ) is by deﬁnition

where SABJ is the Euclidean action for ABJ(M ) theory (see Appendix A). In the following
R will be chosen to be the fundamental representation of U (N|M ): this implies that the
trace is taken in the fundamental representation N or M of the two gauge groups.

In general this Wilson loop operator is not supersymmetric unless θ = ±ϕ: in this case,
having chosen the trace in its deﬁnition, it can be mapped by a suitable conformal trans-
formation to a closed 1/6 BPS Wilson loop [55].

3 The cusp anomalous dimension in ABJ(M) theory and its computation

through ladder diagrams

In this Section we discuss the deﬁnition of the cusp anomalous dimension in ABJ(M)
theories and its computation in a limit in which ladder diagrams dominate. New features
in the N (cid:54)= M will emerge due to the exponentiation properties of the cusped loops.

3.1 The cusp anomalous dimension in ABJ(M) theory

We start by recalling the N = 4 SYM case: the generalized cusp anomalous dimension is
deﬁned by the logarithmic divergent behaviour of a cusped Wilson loop [22]

(cid:104)Wcusp(cid:105) (cid:39) e−Γcusp(ϕ,θ) log

ΛU V
ΛIR .

(3.1)

Here ΛU V and ΛIR stand for the ultraviolet and infrared cut-oﬀs respectively, that reg-
ularize the speciﬁc divergences associated to the cusp angle and the inﬁnite extension of
the lines. Typically one takes ΛIR = 1/L, where L measures the (ﬁnite) length of the two
edges and ΛU V = 1/δ, with δ being a short-length scale either cutting or smoothing out
the the cusp singularity. Alternatively one can use dimensional regularization [23] and the
logarithm is replaced by a simple pole 1/. After the usual renormalization of the gauge

– 7 –

theory1, the relation between the bare and renormalized Wilson loop operator, for closed
contours, is

W B

cusp = ZcuspW R

(3.2)

where the renormalization constant Zcusp depends on the dimensional regularization pa-
rameter  and the subtraction point µ (in addition to the coupling constant λ). When
considering the standard cusp built out of two straight lines of length L, the relation (3.2)
must be, in general, corrected as follows [33–36]

W B

cusp = ZcuspZopenW R

cusp.

(3.3)

The second renormalization constant cancels spurious divergences due to the fact that we
are dealing with an open (and then non gauge-invariant) loop operator. The separation
between the two contributions is ﬁxed by the renormalization condition Zcusp|ϕ=θ=0 = 1.
The cusp anomalous dimension is deﬁned as2

Γcusp(ϕ, θ) = µ

d
dµ

log Zcusp ,

(3.4)

and plays the role of the anomalous dimension of a (non-local) quantum operator. Although
the open cusped Wilson loop is not gauge invariant, the cusp anomalous dimension Γcusp
turns out to be so. At the perturbative level the cusp divergence comes from diagrams
with propagators connecting both rays of the cusp and its exponentiation is governed
In the N = 4 SYM case, the perfect balance
by their maximal non-abelian part [23].
between the gauge and the scalars contributions cancels, in the Feynman gauge, all the
inﬁnities related to integrations along the smooth part of the contour (Zopen = 1). Thus
only the singularities associated to the discontinuous behavior at the cusp appear and one
immediately singles out the relevant diagrams to be computed [37, 38].

In the ABJ(M) case the situation is more subtle. First of all the presence of the fermionic
contributions breaks that balance and divergences persist even in the straight-line limit,
at least in dimensional regularization and in the Landau gauge [55]. Moreover there are
two gauge groups and the fermionic interactions, that live in the oﬀ-diagonal sector of the
super-connection, mix non-trivially the U (N ) and U (M ) structures. Thus a non-standard
form of exponentiation for the divergence of the cusped Wilson loop is expected. Actually
in the ABJM case (N = M ) the renormalization properties should be similar to the N = 4
SYM case, as explicitly checked at two-loop in [55]. In particular we will expect a single
exponential behavior for the vacuum expectation value of the cusped loop operator.

In the ABJ case (N (cid:54)= M ), as usual in the theory of renormalization of composed local
operator, we would expect instead the arising of a matrix-valued set of renormalization
constants:

1In N = 4 SYM this step is superﬂuous, being the β-function vanishing
2In the deﬁnition of the anomalous dimension, the limit  → 0 is understood.

(3.6)

In general the matrix ˜Zcusp in (3.6) is obtained by rewriting the matrix ˜Zab in (3.5) as
(Zopen ˜Zcusp)ab with normalization condition ( ˜Zcusp)ab|ϕ=θ=0 = δab. The scaling limit (1.2)
considered in this paper selects only diagrams connecting the two halves of the loop, then
Zopen = 1 and ˜Z = ˜Zcusp.

3.2 The scaling limit selecting ladder diagrams

In [39] it was considered the scaling limit (1.1) in N = 4 SYM: there pure scalar exchanges
between the rungs of the cusped Wilson loop become dominant and can be resummed by
means of a Bethe-Salpeter equation [39]. Subleading corrections can be also systemati-
cally included in this scheme and consistency at strong coupling with semiclassical string
computations has been found [56].

In our case, we want to consider a similar limit: upon a quick inspection of the perturbative
diagrams we recognize two types of relevant contributions (we refer to [55] for details on
the perturbative expansion and related computations). At one-loop we have the single
fermionic exchange (that is the same for the up and down diagonal blocks)

3These two combinations provides a natural gauge invariant basis for the information contained in the
superholonomy deﬁned by L(τ ). The presence of these two diﬀerent possibilities is the source of all the

SYM, except that here it appears at two-loop and the scaling behavior is diﬀerent.

It is not diﬃcult to realize that, at leading order, the generic diagrams surviving the limit
consist of ladders made by fermionic and scalar exchanges, that should therefore summed
up to obtain the complete result. We remark that the contributions coming from diagrams
ending on a single line, and so leading to divergences not related to the cusp renormalization
constant, are automatically suppressed in our limit. In the next Section we will derive an
eﬃcient way to sum up all the relevant ladder diagrams.

The general strategy to sum up ladder diagrams for Wilson loops constructed by straight-
lines was introduced in [57] and used in [39] to derive the leading behavior of the N = 4
SYM cusp anomaly in the scaling limit. We adapt their technique to our case.

We denote the sum of the ladder diagrams with end-points within the intervals (0, S) and
b(S, T ), where (a, b) are group indices that can be (i, j) ∈ U (N ) or
(0, T ) of the cusp by Fa
(ˆi, ˆj) ∈ U (M ), respectively. Fa

In the scaling limit (1.2) the scalar and the

fermionic couplings of the loop dominate and one has to consider only exchanges of these

For  = 0 equations (4.11) can be decoupled easily since the kernels (4.12) are independent
of y. Indeed, by introducing

with C1,2,3,4 constants which have to be ﬁxed by imposing the boundary conditions as we
will discuss in the following. The x−dependent equations (4.19) can be seen as the two
Schroedinger equations of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical system [58], therefore
E and ˜E are non-negative. In principle one could solve for these equations. However we
are only interested to consider the case in which the edges of the cusp extend to inﬁnity,
In this limit x ∼ 0 and y is very large, thus we make the
i.e. S and T very large.

– 13 –

ansatz E = ˜E = 0 4 and we set ψ+(0) = ψ−(0) = 1 since they can be reabsorbed in the
normalization constants C1, C2, C3, C4.

We ﬁx the constants C1, . . . , C4 by matching the perturbative result. In d = 3 there are
UV divergences coming from the integration regions close to the cusps. To isolate this
divergence we set smin = tmin = δ which means ymin = ln δ
L ≡ −L0. At tree level,
obviously

F (0)(0,−L0) = √N ,

and

ˆF (0)(0,−L0) = √M .

4In the weak coupling limit for positive energy values the solutions of (4.20) become oscillatory.

In order to extract the cusp anomalous dimension at arbitrary ϕ from the result (4.27),
we have simply to recast them in a suitable form to single out the logarithmic divergence.
Going back to the original (dimensionful) variables, we deﬁne

previously for dimensional reason, will not play any role in the following. With the above

We have exactly reproduced the double-exponential structure found at two-loop in [55]: it
comes from an all-order computation, in a particular limit, strongly supporting the mixing
picture. In Section 5 we will discuss how the cusp anomalous dimension is related to this
result.

4.2 The straight-line limit: the solution for  (cid:54)= 0
We consider here the straight-line limit ϕ = 0: remarkably the system enjoys supersym-
metry for any value of  and the cusp anomalous dimension can be computed exactly. To
show this fact we ﬁrst perform the change of variable x → ix(cid:48) and y → 1
2 y(cid:48). Then using
(4.13), eqs. (4.11) become
(cid:3)H(x(cid:48), y(cid:48)) =(cid:104)(cid:126)∇W (x(cid:48), y(cid:48)) · (cid:126)∇W (x(cid:48), y(cid:48)) − (cid:3)W (x(cid:48), y(cid:48))(cid:105)H(x(cid:48), y(cid:48)) ,

5 The determination of Γcusp(ϕ)

Above we have seen that the quantum expectation value of our cusped Wilson loop or-
ganizes itself as a double exponential in the limit (1.2) (see (4.30) or (4.39)). Here we
want to extract the cusp anomalous dimension from the Bethe-Salpeter results. We ﬁnd
convenient to express the traced and supertraced operators W B
a , a = ±, on a basis W B
i ,
i = 1, 2, whose elements renormalize multiplicatively, i.e.

while the regulator dependent parts enter in the Z(i)
cusp (in this discussion we can neglect
the additional divergences subtracted by Zopen since they are suppressed in the limit of

where the deﬁnition (4.32) for a has been used and ˆλ1 and ˆλ2 are the two eﬀective coupling
constants introduced in (1.2).
In the case of ABJM, where N = M , the two coupling
constants of course coincide: ˆλ1 = ˆλ2 ≡ ˆλ.
In order to extract the cusp anomalous dimension at arbitrary ϕ, we have to consider
the result (4.30). We ﬁrst consider the ABJM case. As already announced in Section 3.1
we observe a drastic simpliﬁcation of the expectation value of the traced operator with
the disappearance of one of the two exponentials. In other words the trace renormalizes
multiplicatively. Conversely the supertrace stills mixes with the trace. Therefore, for
M = N , we can associate a cusp anomalous dimension, Γcusp(ϕ, ˆλ), directly to W+ though
the usual deﬁnition (3.1) and, using (4.15), we ﬁnd:

cusp(ϕ) = −Γ(2)

consistent with the limit (5.5) and for ϕ = θ = i∞, Γ(1,2)
Some remarks on the results (4.30) and (4.39) and the consequent form of Γ(i)
cusp are now
in order. First we analyze the structure of the exponentiation in the ABJ case:
looking
at our explicit calculation, one could expect that the positive cusp anomalous dimension
dominates, while the negative one gives a subleading contribution. On the other hand they
appear on the same footing in our computations and, much more crucially, consistency
with perturbative results requires the presence of both of them. However we believe that
the simple relation Γ(1)
cusp(ϕ) implied by (5.7) does not survive when the
subleading corrections in θ are included. A second important observation concerns the
actual functional form of Γcusp(ϕ). Let us concentrate for the moment on the N = M
case. The ﬁnal expression (5.6) is just the exponentiation of the one-loop result, namely
the leading cusp divergence undergoes to an abelian exponentiation in the ladder limit.
This result is completely diﬀerent from the analogous N = 4 SYM resummation, where
an highly non-trivial function appears at this order, even for ϕ = 0. The reason relies
of course in the supersymmetric structure of the eﬀective Schroedinger equation but it
has also a perturbative explanation: fermionic and bosonic diagrams do not exponentiate
in an abelian way by themselves and it is their delicate balance that, order by order in
the coupling constant, generates this nice behavior. We have checked explicitly at three-
loop in perturbation theory this fact. The N (cid:54)= M situation presents instead a slightly
more involved structure: we have still an abelian-like exponentiation at this order, but
when expressed in terms of the two (scaled) ’t Hooft couplings ˆλ1, ˆλ2 it appears through
a square root of their product. This is a further eﬀect of the diagonalization process and
at moment we do not have a satisfying explanation from general principles. We stress that
from the point of view of the original CS level k the exponentiation is one-loop as well. A
third and, may be, more interesting remark is related to the strong-coupling limit and the
connection with string theory. To be concrete, we shall consider the simpler case of ABJM:
because of the abelian-like exponentiation we do not have any non-trivial interpolation

between weak and strong-coupling and the scaling limit does not match the(cid:112)ˆλ behavior

of string theory. At variance with N = 4 SYM the scaling limit does not seem to commute
with the strong-coupling limit, a fact that in four-dimensions was not expected a priori
(see the comments in the original computation [39]). We hope to come back soon on this
point when the subleading contributions will be computed.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we have studied a cusped Wilson loop in N = 6 Super Chern-Simons theory,
constructed with lines that are 1/2 BPS. We have computed the associated cusp anomalous
dimension in a scaling limit in which ladder diagrams dominate: because of the 1/2 BPS
character of the two halves, we have both bosonic and fermionic ladder exchanges and their
resummation is encoded into a coupled Bethe-Salpeter equation. We have seen that it can
be mapped into a supersymmetric Schroedinger equation whose ground state solution pro-

– 18 –

vide an exact expression for the cusp anomalous dimensions. Actually we found that, in the
general N (cid:54)= M case, the traced Wilson loop undergoes through a double-exponentiation,
as ﬁrst observed in [55]. This has been interpreted as an operator mixing under cusp
renormalization: we have associated to the eigenvalues of the mixing matrix two indepen-
dent cusp anomalous dimensions. The ﬁnal result is very simple and the exponentiations
are abelian, the cusp anomalous dimensions are one-loop exact up diagonalization. The
strong-coupling limit is therefore trivial and we do not ﬁnd consistency with string theory
computation [59]: we argue that the scaling limit considered here does not commute with
the strong-coupling limit. Concerning abelian exponentiation, a similar phenomenon has
been observed recently [60] in studying N = 4 SYM cusped Wilson loops in k-symmetric
representations: at large N and k planar diagrams dominate and the exponentiation is of
abelian type.

The obvious follow-up of the present work is to take into account the subleading corrections
to the scaling limit: in [56] a systematic approach to this computation has been developed
in the N = 4 SYM case and it should be possible to perform an analogous investigation
here. Preliminary results seem promising. It would be interesting to see if the supersym-
metric structure we have found is preserved beyond leading order: in any case we expect a
non-trivial modiﬁcation of the relation Γ(1)
cusp(ϕ). Another direction consists
in checking the exponential structure at three-loop: the mixing we have observed here
prescribes an exponentiation with deﬁnite group-dependent coeﬃcients (see eq. (4.30)),
that appear to be the same both in the scaling limit and in the general two-loop result
[55]. It would be of course nice to have a deeper understanding for the occurrence of the
mixing coeﬃcients: a closer look at the supersymmetric quantum mechanics discussed in
[8], where the 1/2 BPS line is obtained from a Higgsing procedure, should be probably
useful for this task.

cusp(ϕ) = −Γ(2)

More ambitiously, one would like to approach the generalized cusp anomalous dimension
in ABJ(M) theory from a general point of view, with the hope to obtain other all-order
result by integrability or localization. In four-dimensions a particularly powerful approach
has been pushed forward recently [61, 62], applying to cusped Wilson loop the technique of
the quantum spectral curve. Beautiful results have been obtained for the Bremsstrahlung
function and the quark-anti-quark potential. It would be nice to extend this approach to
ABJ(M) case, in which the quantum spectral curve has been already studied [63]. It should
be also possible to extend the TBA equations derived in [28, 29] in the three-dimensional
context, taking advantage of the investigations presented in [64–66].
