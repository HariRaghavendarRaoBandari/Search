ABSTRACT
We explain some phenomena existing generally in the timing residuals: amplitude
and sign of the second derivative of a pulsar’s spin-frequency (¨ν), some sophisticated
residual patterns, which also change with the time span of data segments. The sample
is taken from Hobbs et al. (2010), in which the pulsar’s spin-frequency and its ﬁrst
derivative have been subtracted from the timing solution ﬁtting. We ﬁrst classify the
timing residual patterns into diﬀerent types based on the sign of ¨ν. Then we use the
magnetic ﬁeld oscillation model developed in our group (Zhang & Xie 2012a) to ﬁt
successfully the diﬀerent kinds of timing residuals with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method. Finally, we simulate the spin evolution over 20 years for a pulsar with typical
parameters and analyze the data with the conventional timing solution ﬁtting. By
choosing diﬀerent segments of the simulated data, we ﬁnd that most of the observed
residual patterns can be reproduced successfully. This is the ﬁrst time that the ob-
served residual patterns are ﬁtted by a model and reproduced by simulations with very
few parameters. From the distribution of the diﬀerent residual patterns in the P − ˙P
diagram, we argue that (1) a single magnetic ﬁeld oscillation mode exists commonly
in all pulsars throughout their lifetimes; (2) there may be a transition period over the
lifetimes of pulsars, in which multiple magnetic ﬁeld oscillation modes exist.

1 INTRODUCTION

Radio pulsars are renowned for unique high-precision clocks
in the universe driven by their stable rotation. The pulsar
timing method provides a model of the pulsar’s astrometric,
orbital and rotational parameters to compare with the ob-
served pulse times of arrival (TOAs) (Manchester & Taylor
1977; Lyne & Smith 2004; Lorimer & Kramer 2005; Ed-
wards, Hobbs & Manchester 2006). Timing residuals of a
pulsar are deﬁned as the diﬀerences between the predicted
TOAs and the actual TOAs. However, radio pulsars exhibit
two main timing irregularities, namely ‘glitches’ that are
sudden increases in spin rate followed by a period of relax-
ation, and ‘timing noise’ that shows long-term and stochas-
tic deviations from a regular spin-down model and mainly
consists of low-frequency structures.

Timing noise can be characterized as a random walk
in the rotational phase, angular velocity or torque and de-
scribes the un-modelled red noise in the observed TOAs

(Cordes & Downs 1985; Shannon & Cordes 2010), implying
a process autocorrelated on a time-scale of hours to years
(Cordes & Helfand 1980). Previously the analyses of timing
noise have been limited by the relatively short data spans.
Only a few papers have analysed a small number of pulsars
for long data spans (Baykal et al. 1999; Shabanova 1995;
Stairs et al. 2000; Shabanova, Lyne & Urama 2001). Most of
the analyses are mainly about obtaining high-quality power
spectral estimates of the timing residuals or ﬁtting the tim-
ing residuals of a single pulsar with a simple model. Recently
Hobbs et al. (2010) (hereafter H10) carried out so far the
most comprehensive survey of timing irregularities in 366
pulsars over time-scales longer than a decade, which have
characteristic ages larger than 104 years. Based on the sim-
ple spin-down model, the second frequency derivative can
be modelled by the cubic terms of a Taylor series as follows,
¨ν(t − t0)3 + ..., (1)
Φ(t) = Φ0 + ν(t − t0) +

˙ν(t − t0)2 +

where Φ0 is the phase at time t0. However, values of ¨ν ob-
tained from timing ﬁts are typically orders of magnitude
larger than the prediction of the vacuum dipole model and

usually have diﬀerent signs. In the meantime, the braking
indices determined by these derivatives have anomalous val-
ues range from −2.6 × 108 to +2.5 × 108. Therefore, Hobbs
et al. argued that these cubic terms are not dominated by
the intrinsic dipole braking of pulsars and only ﬁt the pulse
frequency and its ﬁrst derivative and consider the remaining
features as timing noise. Subsequently, They tried to cate-
gorize the pulsars based on the structures existing in their
timing residuals. Nevertheless, they argued that two prob-
lems exist in their categorization, namely, the TOA precision
achievable and the data spans available.

However, the physical processes behind timing noise
have not been well explained. The phenomenon is attributed
to various mechanisms. It has been suggested that the tim-
ing noise is dominated by the recovery from unseen glitches
(Johnston & Galloway 1999). As the pulsar ages, glitch
activity decreases and the timing noise is dominated by
changes in the magnetosphere. Lyne et al. (2010) demon-
strated that the observed timing noise correlates with the
observed pulse shape, which indicates that some timing noise
may be caused by magnetospheric processes. Some authors
argued that timing noise may be driven by variability in
the coupling between the crust and superﬂuid interior (Al-
par et al 1986; Jones 1990) and ﬂuctuations in the external
spin-down torque (Cheng 1987a,b; Urama, Link & Weisberg
2006). A more complete understanding of timing noise will
provide us an insight into the interior structure of neutron
stars.

An additional possibility is that the magnetic ﬁelds of
pulsars decay with age. Baym et al. (1969) gave the ﬁrst
estimate of the characteristic decay time of their magnetic
ﬁelds. Sang & Chanmugam (1987) argued that the ﬁeld does
not decay exponentially during the lifetime of the neutron
stars. However, a complete theoretical model that could ex-
plain all observations does not exist yet, as the evolution of
the magnetic ﬁeld depend on its conﬁguration that is still
unknown and even the origin of the ﬁeld is not clear until
now. In general, the magnetic ﬁeld is often assumed to oc-
cupy a substantial fraction of a neutron star’s volume and
pass through its core or is conﬁned to relatively not very
deep layers. Recently, three physical processes were proposed
to explain the evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld inside a neu-
tron star: (1) Hall drift, which is the advection of the mag-
netic ﬁeld because of the motion of the free electrons; (2)
Ohmic dissipation, which converts magnetic energy to heat
because of the ﬁnite conductivity of the crust; (3) ambipo-
lar diﬀusion, which is the interaction of the electric currents
with the neutrons deeper inside a neutron star (Goldreich
& Reisenegger 1992). On the other hand, population syn-
thesis studies suggested that old pulsars show no signiﬁcant
magnetic decay over their lifetimes (Regimbau et al. 2001;
Faucher-Giguere & Kaspi 2006), although the opposite con-
clusion has also been claimed (Gonthier et al. 2004; Popov
et al. 2010). These contradictions may be resolved by the as-
sumption that the neutron star magnetic ﬁeld is maintained
by two current systems. Long living currents in the super-
conducting core support the large-scale dipolar ﬁeld and are
responsible for the spin down of old pulsars, but currents in
the crust support the short-lived part of the ﬁeld (Pons &
Geppert 2007).

The estimates of the magnetic ﬁeld strength of neutron
stars usually come from radio pulsars with measured spin-

down rates. As the real ages of these pulsars are usually un-
known, one can determine their spin-down age, τc = P/2 ˙P
, where P is the spin period of the pulsar, as the indicators
of the true ages of pulsars. However, Zhang & Xie (2011)
showed that spin-down ages are normally signiﬁcantly larger
than the ages of the supernova remnants physically associ-
ated with them, which in principle should be the unbiased
age indicators of the pulsars (Lyne et al. 1975; Geppert et al.
1999). It may be evidence of the magnetic ﬁeld decay over
their lifetimes, as the decay can alter the spin-down rate of
a pulsar signiﬁcantly. To explain the observed periodic or
quasi-periodic evolution of the spin of pulsars, it is natu-
ral to introduce some oscillation parameters. Zhang & Xie
(2012a) proposed a magnetic ﬁeld evolution model, which
consists a long-term decay modulated by short-term oscilla-
tions and can explain the observed statistical properties of
¨ν well.

In this paper, we will mainly explain the reason for
amplitude and sign of second frequency derivative and the
structure of timing residuals of a given pulsar varying with
the time span of data segments. By contrasting with Hobbs’s
opinion, we argue that timing residuals, which have sub-
tracted pulsar’s spin frequency and its ﬁrst derivative and
are dominated by ¨ν (i.e. Fig. 3 in H10), are still due to the
evolution of magnetic ﬁeld of pulsars. The structure of the
paper is as follows. In the next section, we introduce the sam-
ple selection of the pulsars, and classify the timing residuals
based on the the sign of ¨ν and the detailed structure of tim-
ing residuals. In section 3, we review magnetic ﬁeld evolu-
tion model we developed previously and use Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to ﬁt the timing residuals
with a single oscillation component and two oscillation com-
ponents of the model. Then we reclassify the timing residuals
based on the number of oscillation components. In section
4, we discuss the evolution of pulsars through their distri-
bution of diﬀerent kinds of timing residuals in the P − ˙P
diagram and physical implication of the oscillation term.
The summary of our results is given in section 5.

2 CLASSIFY THE TIMING RESIDUALS

As we mentioned above, Hobbs et al. (2010) attempted to
categorize pulsars based on the structures existing in their
timing residuals: (1) 37% of the timing residuals are domi-
nated by the measurement errors and show no features; (2)
20% have residuals that can be modelled by a signiﬁcant
positive ¨ν value; (3) 16% have cubic terms that correspond
to a negative ¨ν value; and (4) 27% show more complicated
structures. In the meantime, they showed that their simple
categorization has two problems: (1) The TOAs of some pul-
sars are measured more precisely than the TOAs of others
(see Fig. 4 in H10); (2) The structure of timing residuals of
any pulsar is likely to change as the data span varies (see
Fig. 5 in H10).

To better classify the timing residuals, we try to sep-
arate the pulsars that their timing residuals have detailed
structures and those that have no structures in the residuals
from the H10 sample. Figure 1 shows the distributions of σ3
and σ1 of all 366 pulsars taken from H10, where σ1 represents
the un-weighted rms of the residuals after ﬁtting for ν and
˙ν, and σ3 represents the rms after whitening the data set by

ﬁtting and removing harmonically related sinusoids (Hobbs
et al. 2004; Hobbs, Lyne & Kramer 2010). From these distri-
butions alone we can not identify those pulsars with obvious
structures in their timing residuals. In Figure 2 we plot the
distribution of σ3/σ1 of all 366 pulsars we take from H10.
We ﬁnd that there are two distinctly diﬀerent peaks in Fig-
ure 2; the pulsars in one peak that the values of σ3/σ1 are
approximately 0 have distinct structures of timing residuals
as shown in Figures 3 and 4, but in the other peak no dis-
tinct structure exists, which means that the residuals after
subtraction of the pulsar’s ν and ˙ν are approximately white
noise. Therefore, the pulsars in our sample are selected with
σ3/σ1 < 0.4, which have periodic or quasi-periodic struc-
tures in their timing residuals; the number of pulsars with
σ3/σ1 > 0.4 or σ3/σ1 < 0.4 are 166 and 200, respectively. In
Figure 5 we plot the distributions of σ1 and σ3 of the two
samples; we can not distinguish the two samples based on
σ1 or σ3 individually, since their main peaks overlap in the
distributions.

We thus select the sample that have detailed structures
to study the evolution of ¨ν with their timing residuals. In the
ﬁrst step, we classify the timing residuals based on the sign
of ¨ν. In addition, based on the structural tendency of timing
residuals, we deﬁne the residuals of ¨ν > 0 as W mode (see
Fig. 3). Conversely, we deﬁne the residuals of ¨ν < 0 as M
mode (see Fig. 4). According to equation (1), to the timing
residuals after substraction of the pulsar’s spin-frequency
and its ﬁrst derivative, the overall structural tendency is
dominated by the sign of ¨ν. That is to say, the overall shapes
of these two modes (see Fig. 3a and Fig. 4a respectively) are
the basic shape of a cubic polynomial after removal of ν and
˙ν. Therefore, these features are inevitable results of math-
ematics. However, there is still no self-consistent theory to

explain the reason for the sign of ¨ν. Besides, there exist some
residuals in both modes that show more complicated struc-
tures beyond the simple mathematics. Therefore, based on
the numbers of local extrema, the W mode residuals are
further divided into W a, W b, W c and W d subclasses corre-
sponding to the residual patterns with two, three, four and
more local extreme points (see Fig. 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d which

sample of σ3/σ1 < 0.4), respectively. Similarly, the M mode
residuals are further divided into M a, M b and M c subclasses
corresponding to the residual patterns with two, three and
four local extreme points (see Fig. 4a, 4b and 4c).

ATNF Pulsar Catalogue (Manchester et al. 2005). From the
distribution of our sample we see that it covers radio pulsars,
millisecond pulsars and high energy pulsars. In the following
section, we will attempt to use phenomenological model to
reproduce these timing residuals, ﬁnd the physical process
that leads to the phenomena, i.e., timing residuals generally
includes positive and negative values of ¨ν and some of them
have sophisticated structures. Then we will further explain
the reason for the structure of timing residuals of a given
pulsar varying with the time span of the data analyzed.

3 MAGNETIC FIELD DECAY AND

OSCILLATION MODEL

For the case of a neutron star in vacuum, due to the asym-
metry of magnetic ﬁeld about its rotation axis, it radi-
ates energy and losses angular momentum. Assuming pure
magnetic dipole radiation dominates over the gravitational
quadrupole radiation as the braking mechanism for a pul-
sar’s spin down, we have the magnetic-dipole model (Pacini

From equation (10) we can ﬁnd that the pulse phase can
be written as a polynomial to the third order, plus several
sinusoidal waves. One thing we would like to emphasize here
is that ¨ν0 we deﬁned in equation (10) is not equivalent to
our derived instantaneous ¨ν(t) in equation (6), neither to
the averaged ¯¨ν from conventional ﬁtting observed data span
with the third order polynomial of Taylor expansion. The
power-law decay of magnetic ﬁeld always results in ¨ν0 > 0,
since the decay index α > 0. In Section 2, the classiﬁcation
of timing residuals of our sample is based on the value of
practical ﬁtting averaged ¯¨ν.

In practical procedure of pulsar timing, ﬁtting a polyno-
mial to the third order without sinusoidal waves is a common
treatment:

sin(φi + ωit), respectively, which are all functions of time

where A = 8π2R6sin2 α
, m is the magnetic dipole moment, B
is the strength of the dipole magnetic ﬁeld at its equatorial
surface, R denotes the radius of neutron star, α is the incli-
nation of the magnetic axis with respect to the rotation axis,
and I is its moment of inertia. Deriving ¨ν from equation (3),
we have

¨ν = 3 ˙ν2/ν + 2 ˙ν ˙B/B.

(4)

For pulsars with characteristic ages larger than 105 yr in H10
sample, almost equal numbers of pulsars have each sign of ¨ν.
According to equation (4), this phenomenon can be caused
by the evolution of magnetic ﬁeld of second term. However,
by considering only monotonic change of magnetic ﬁeld or
torque cannot explain this phenomenon. That is also the
reason why other authors suspect that the cubic terms are
not due to the intrinsic dipole braking of pulsars (Hobbs et
al. 2004).

However, we have constructed a phenomenological
model for the evolution of magnetic ﬁeld B, which contains
a long-term power-law decay modulated by short-term os-
cillations (Zhang & Xie 2012a,b),

B(t) = BL(t)(1 +

(5)

where t represents the pulsar’s age in arbitrary units, ki (cid:28) 1,
φi, Ti are the amplitude, phase and period of the i − th os-
cillation component, respectively. Assuming BL = B0((t +
t0)/t0)−α, in which B0 is the ﬁeld strength at age t0, i.e. at
the epoch t = 0, and α is the index of the power law decay.
From equation (5), we can obtain the analytic approxima-
tion for ¨ν (see Zhang & Xie 2012a Eq. 21),

(6)

where fi = 2πki/Ti, t is the real age of the pulsar. We
can see that the second term of equation (6) dominates the
sign of ¨ν, if | α
t | < fi. Here we assume that the decay index
α = 0.5 is constant, the value of k and T range from 10−5
to 10−2 and from 2 yr to 100 yr, and fmax = 1.0 × 10−9
can be derived (Zhang & Xie 2012a). Therefore, only to the
pulsars younger than about 1000 yr, the ﬁrst term of equa-
tion (6) can dominate the sign of ¨ν. Since the ages of the
pulsars in our sample are all more than 104 yr, the ﬁrst term
of equation (6) can be neglected, especially over the short-
term evolution. In our phenomenological model, therefore,
the sign and magnitude of ¨ν can be well described and the
structure of timing residuals reﬂects the oscillation of its
magnetic ﬁeld. Furthermore, for constant k and T (i.e. pe-
riodic oscillation), the key factor that inﬂuences the sign of
¨ν is the variation of the phase of oscillation component.

To further verify our magnetic oscillation model, we try
to use it to simulate the observed timing residuals. Since

Therefore, from equation (12) we can see that ¯¨ν is consisted
of ¨ν0 and the third order terms of polynomial ﬁtting of os-
cillation components. But instantaneous ¨ν(t) includes the
contributions of power-law decay and all the oscillation com-
ponents at every moment. Only if there is no oscillation in
the magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., Fi = 0, then ¨ν(t) (cid:39) ¯¨ν = ¨ν0

Therefore, the timing series of phases Φs(t) of the simulated
TOAs can be obtained based on equation (10). Then, we ﬁt

To extract the best model parameters by compar-

Mackey et al. 2013), which is an aﬃne invariant ensemble
sampler for MCMC and designed for Bayesian parameter es-
timation, to sample the full parameter space. Based on Bayes
theorem, assuming p and d represent the model parameters
and the data (t, residuals, errors.), respectively. Therefore,
the posterior probability function can be written as,

P(p| d) ∝ P(d| p) P(p),

(16)
where P(d| p) is the likelihood function, P(p) is the prior
function.

to the value of σ3.

In prior function (P(p)), we need to give physically ac-
ceptable ranges of our parameters. Here we set priors within
given bounds:

ωmax = 1.0 × 10−7 s−1;
0 ν3

maximum likelihood. To each parameter, we start by initial-
izing 100 walkers in a tiny Gaussian ball around the max-
imum likelihood result; (2) We sample the parameter space

according to the P(p| d) and regard the set of parameters
for which the P(p| d) is maximized as our best model, since
the parameter set can reproduce the Rre(ti) most closely;
(3) We can get marginalized distribution for each parameter
independently in one-dimension histograms and two dimen-
sional projections of posterior probability distributions (In
Appendix A, we present the two-dimensional marginalized
distributions of all the parameters of the seven typical pul-
sars); (4) We choose the medians of the one-dimension pos-
terior distributions as the best ﬁtting parameters, and the
parameter uncertainties are calculated with their 68 percent
conﬁdence intervals.

Speciﬁcally, the number of parameters in our model is
determined by the number of oscillation parameters of mag-
netic ﬁeld. Figures 7 and 8 show the corresponding power
spectra of the typical pulsars in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.
The number of main peaks in the power spectrum equals the
number of oscillation components in our magnetic ﬁeld evo-
lution model that we assume initially. Then we give a set of
initial values of the oscillation parameters ki, Ti and φi in
equation (5) to obtain the timing residuals to be ﬁtted, as
well as the initial values of ν0, ˙ν0 and ¨ν0 and the observa-
tion time span ts. The values of ν0 and ˙ν0 are selected from
H10 to each pulsar. We keep them constant, since they can
hardly change during the short-term evolution. Here we set
the power-law index α = 0.5 and t0 as characteristic age to
determine the value of ¨ν0 in equation (10), because the short
observation time span can not really constrain the mono-
tonic evolution of the magnetic ﬁelds of these pulsars. (We
will further discuss if the long-term monotonic evolution of
magnetic ﬁeld would inﬂuence the patterns of timing residu-
als in such short-term observations in section 5.1.) Based on
equation (15), to W a, W b, M a and M b types, three param-
eters are needed to be sampled by MCMC (F , ω and φ). To
W c, W d and M c types, which include two oscillation com-
ponent of magnetic ﬁeld, six parameters should be sampled
by MCMC (F1, ω1, φ1, F2, ω2 and φ2). After getting the
best ﬁtting parameters, we convert them to the parameters
we need, i.e., ki, Ti, φi, and fi.

Figures 9 and 10 show the comparisons between the
reported and ﬁtting timing residuals for those several typical
pulsars. In the framework of magnetic ﬁeld oscillation model,
we can reproduce almost all types of timing residuals except
the W d type. The W d type timing residuals of B1826-17
contain three main peaks in its power spectrum; however,
we only use two oscillation components to ﬁt the timing
residuals to simplify the problem.

In Tables 2 and 3 we present the best ﬁtting parame-
ters which are converted from Fi, ωi and φi, corresponding
to the diﬀerent kinds of timing residuals. Combining equa-

tion (6) and equation (4),(cid:80) fi (cid:39) ¨ν(t)/2 ˙ν(t) = ˙B/B, which

can reﬂect the required fractional variation of the magnetic
ﬁeld in the short-term evolution. Figures 11 and 12 show
the comparisons between the power spectra of the ﬁtting
timing residuals and the reported timing residuals of typical
pulsars.

5 RECLASSIFY THE TIMING RESIDUALS

5.2 Periodic Oscillations

Understanding the residual patterns of radio pulsars

9

We use our magnetic ﬁeld oscillation model in equation (5)
and adopt the same initial parameters and observation time
as before, and assume a single oscillation component, corre-
sponding to the oscillation parameters k = 10−4, T = 10 yr
and φ = 0, respectively. The timing residuals are obtained
also by the same steps above. Figure 14 shows the timing
residuals of all the data segments extracted. These timing
residuals include W a, W b, M a and M b types deﬁned in sec-
tion 2. The correlation between the sign of ¯¨ν and diﬀerent
types of timing residuals is the same as that in observations.
From the simulation we also ﬁnd that, the pulsar keeps W a
and M a types for most of the time during the periodic os-
cillation. This result agrees with the fact that W a and M a
types occupy the majority of all the timing residuals in our
sample. This indicates that these four types of timing resid-
uals should be the diﬀerent oscillation stages of the single
oscillation component of magnetic ﬁeld.

As a consequence, the long-term monotonic decay of
magnetic ﬁeld has no impact to the structure of the timing
residuals, but short-term oscillations can explain the obser-
vations well. Therefore, the diﬀerent structures of timing
residuals of observations and the corresponding sign of ¯¨ν
are determined by the observation time, namely, the varia-
tion of the oscillation phase φ of magnetic ﬁeld. Obviously,
our previous classiﬁcation of timing residuals only according
to the tendency of structure does not have physical signiﬁ-
cance. Hereafter, we reclassify the previously deﬁned timing
residuals of W a, W b, M a and M b types, which are all re-
produced by a single oscillation component of magnetic ﬁeld,
as Single-component Residuals (SR) mode; the other types
which include double or multiple oscillation components are
deﬁned as Multi-component Residuals (M R) mode. Since
the timing residuals that include double or multiple oscil-
lation components are complex, we do not simulate these
situations in this paper.

As we pointed out in the previous section, to each oscillation
component, the sign of ¯¨ν is dominated by the variation of
phase, which is an oscillation parameter in our magnetic ﬁeld
oscillation model; namely, the sign of ¯¨ν is mainly determined
by the observation time. In the meantime, our magnetic os-
cillation model have reproduced all the typical timing resid-
uals well. Subsequently, we will further attempt to explain
the sign of ¯¨ν varying with the time span of data analyzed so
as to inﬂuence the structure of timing residuals. The diﬀer-
ent types of timing residuals we deﬁned may be caused by
the diﬀerent stages of magnetic ﬁeld oscillation.

5.1 Long-term Monotonic Evolution of Magnetic

Field

Here we only discuss two cases of long-term monotonic evo-
lution of magnetic ﬁeld for simplicity. We ﬁrst explore if the
exponential decay can inﬂuence the patterns of timing resid-
uals, although Zhang & Xie (2012a) have ruled out the ex-
ponential decay as the long-term monotonic evolution of the
magnetic ﬁelds for the sample of H10. We ﬁrst assume an ex-
ponential ﬁeld decay BD(t) = B0e−t/τD , where the timescale
of decay τD = 10 Myr and B0 is the strength of the surface
dipole magnetic ﬁeld at time t0 = 0, the initial parameters
¯ν = 9.858 s−1, ¯˙ν = −5.96× 10−13 s−2, and the characteristic
age is 2.62 × 105 yr; the observation time span we simulate
is τ = 20 yr. We plot the timing residuals by extracting the
ﬁrst 10 yr of the simulated observational data segment that
is obtained by numerical computation just like in the previ-
ous section. Then we extract the data segment from the 1st
year to the 11th year of the simulated observation to plot
the timing residuals; the time step is one year and other data
segments are taken in a similar fashion, until we extract the
data segment from the 11th year to the 20th year. The up-
per panel of Figure 13 shows the timing residuals of all the
data segments extracted. To the short term observation of
the pulsar, we can see that the structures and the magnitude
of all the timing residuals are exactly the same during the
same observation time interval. The sign and magnitude of
¯¨ν do not change, because the observation time span and the
structure of timing residuals are all the same.

We then assume a power-law ﬁeld decay BL(t) = B0(t+
t0/t0)−α, where the decay index α = 0.5, and B0 is the
strength of surface dipole magnetic ﬁeld at time t0 = 0.
The initial parameters and observation time span are kept
the same as the conditions of the exponential decay. The
timing residuals are obtained also by the same operation
steps as in the previous subsection. The lower panel of Fig-
ure 13 shows the timing residuals of all the data segments
extracted. The result is nearly the same as for the expo-
nential decay, namely, the structure of timing residuals and
the sign of ¯¨ν are all independent from the diﬀerent obser-
vation stages in the short term observation. Therefore, the
long-term monotonic evolution of magnetic ﬁeld can not in-
ﬂuence the patterns of timing residuals during short-term
observations.

6 PHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS OF M R MODE

Figure 15 shows the distribution of the pulsars of the re-
classiﬁed timing residuals in the P − ˙P diagram. For the
SR mode pulsars, their distribution covers almost all the
evolution stages of pulsars, including normal radio pulsars,
millisecond pulsars and high energy pulsars. However, the
distribution of M R mode pulsars are mainly concentrated
in the region of normal radio pulsars.

To examine if these two samples are derived from
the same distribution, we make the two-dimensional
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test; the returned p-value is
0.13, which means these two samples unlikely originate from
the same distribution. Therefore, we speculate that the
physical processes that show a single oscillation form ex-
ist over the whole evolution of pulsars all along. However, as
the neutron stars evolve to normal pulsars, there may exist a
transition region (T R), where double or multiple oscillation
components could appear in some pulsars. Afterwards the
single oscillation mode dominates again, accompanied with
the evolution of pulsars. T R is shown in Figure 15 with the
pink dashed lines and dotted lines, where the magnetic ﬁeld

is from 3× 1011 G to 3× 1012 G and the characteristic age is
from 105 yr to 107 yr. The T R phenomenon may be indirect
evidence of long term magnetic ﬁeld evolution of pulsars.

In both isolated and accreting neutron stars, the Hall
eﬀect and Ohmic decay are both very important to the long
term magnetic ﬁeld evolution (Cumming et al. 2004). Since
the Hall drift conserves magnetic energy, it cannot be a di-
rect cause of magnetic ﬁeld decay. However, Jones (1988)
ﬁrst demonstrated that Hall drift could transport magnetic
ﬁeld from the inner crust to the outer crust, where Ohmic
dissipation is much more eﬀective than in the inner crust.
Hall drift can also pump energy from an internal strong
toroidal ﬁeld to the poloidal component, resulting in in-
crease of magnetic ﬁeld (Pons et al. 2012; Gourgouliatos
& Cumming 2014). It indicates that Hall drift may produce
damped oscillation with long period between toroidal and
poloidal ﬁeld components (Marchant et al. 2014). Cumming
et al. (2004) proposed that the Hall eﬀect dominates over
ohmic decay after the time tswitch (cid:39) 104B
−3
12 yr, when the
magnetization parameter, RB = tOhm
> 1, where tOhm and
tHall
tHall represent the timescales of Ohmic decay and Hall ef-
fect, respectively. The Hall timescale at lower densities of
the crust is (Cumming et al. 2004)

Gourgouliatos & Cumming (2014) investigated the evo-
lution due to Hall drift using diﬀerent initial conditions, and
found that eventually the ﬁeld evolves towards a similar con-

Understanding the residual patterns of radio pulsars

13

ﬁguration deﬁned as ‘attractor’, which consists of a domi-
nant dipolar poloidal ﬁeld coupled to a octopole through a
weak toroidal quadrupole. Recently Marchant et al. (2014)
did a similar numerical simulation about the eﬀect of Hall
drift to magnetic ﬁeld evolution in neutron stars. The initial
condition Ep/E = 0.9 represents the ratio of poloidal to to-
tal energy, namely the poloidal component contains a large
amount of energy, and RB = 100 means that Hall drift dom-
inates the evolution. From the result of the numerical sim-
ulation, we ﬁnd that the current associated to the toroidal
ﬁeld drags the poloidal ﬁeld lines closer to one of the poles,
since the bending of the poloidal ﬁeld lines changes the ori-
entation of the toroidal ﬁeld; therefore, the poloidal ﬁeld
lines are dragged to the opposite pole. This stable oscilla-
tion is repeated until the evolution is dominated by Ohmic
dissipation (see Fig. 1 in Marchant et al 2014). From Fig.
1 in Marchant et al. (2014) we estimate the beginning of
the oscillation is nearly τHall; after approximately 100 τHall,
the oscillation vanishes when it reaches the attractor state.
According to equation (19), we estimate that the evolution
time is from 0.6 × 105 yr to 0.6 × 107 yr, consistent with
the T R deﬁned above. It is reasonable to speculate that this
stage of oscillations between the poloidal and toroidal com-
ponents is the main stage to produce the M R mode timing
residuals. We thus further argue that the evolution of the
modes of timing residuals may have a relation with the long
term evolution of magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations.

7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In this paper, we separate the pulsars that have more de-
tailed structure in the timing residuals than others from the
H10 sample as our study sample (σ3/σ1 < 0.4). According
to the sign of ¯¨ν, we have classiﬁed the timing residuals as
W mode and M mode, which are further subdivided into
several kinds of subclasses based on the structure of timing
residuals (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). Then we used our phenomeno-
logical model to ﬁt the timing residuals of the typical pul-
sars by the MCMC method respectively (Fig. 9 and Fig. 10)
and obtained the best ﬁtting oscillation parameters to all
the types of timing residuals. After that, we simulated the
short term observation of an individual pulsar with diﬀerent
magnetic ﬁeld evolution models. Furthermore, we reclassi-
ﬁed the timing residuals as SR mode and M R mode based
on the number of oscillation components of magnetic ﬁeld.
We also analyzed the physical implications from the distri-
bution of timing residuals in the P − ˙P diagram and the
physical mechanisms causing the observational behaviors of
timing residuals. Our main results and conclusions are sum-
marized as follows.

1. Our magnetic ﬁeld oscillation model can reproduce

the general behaviors of timing residuals well.

2. The variation of the observed ¯¨ν and the detailed
structure of timing residuals reﬂect the oscillation of the
magnetic ﬁeld of pulsars.

3. We rule out long-term monotonic evolution of mag-
netic ﬁeld as the underlying mechanism for the observational
timing residual patterns.

4. The diﬀerent structures of timing residuals of obser-
vation and the corresponding sign of ¯¨ν are determined by the

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

observation time, namely, the variation of oscillation phase
φ of magnetic ﬁeld.

5. A single magnetic ﬁeld oscillation mode exists gen-
erally over the whole evolution of pulsars, while M R mode
only exists in the region of normal radio pulsars.

6. The SR mode and M R mode may transit from each
other with the evolution stage of magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgura-
tions.

In this work we only ﬁt the timing residual patterns
of seven typical pulsars in the sample of 200 pulsars with
obvious timing residual patterns, in order to understand the
underlying mechanism of the observational residual patterns
and their variations with observation time. In our next work,
we will ﬁt the data for all other pulsars to understand the
statistical properties of the parameters in our model.

If we can understand better about the behavior of tim-
ing residuals, we may be able to improve the sensitivity of
using pulsars to detect gravitational waves and explore the
physical processes in the interiors of neutron stars. We sug-
gest that our simulation results could be conﬁrmed by using
the existing data and predict that the structure of timing
residuals should vary along with diﬀerent segments of data.
In doing so, we could further understand the behavior of
magnetic ﬁeld oscillation of pulsars.

the parameters of our model with the following steps.

(1) To sample the posterior distribution of parameters,
we use emcee code from (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013),
which provides a fast and stable implementation of an aﬃne-
invariant ensemble sampler for MCMC. We can get the
Rsim(ti) through the analytic expression of pulse phases (see
equation (10) and equation (15)).

(2) We ﬁt the Rsim(ti) to the Rre(ti) preliminarily to
ﬁnd the maximum likelihood. To each parameter, we start

by initializing 100 walkers in a tiny Gaussian ball around
the maximum likelihood result.
(3) We sample the parameter space according to the
P(p| d) regarding the set of parameters for which the
P(p| d) is maximized as our best model, since the parameter
set can reproduce the Rre(ti) most closely. In this process,
we also need to output the time series of each parameter in
the chain, which shows the parameter values for each walker
at each step in the corresponding chain. The walkers start
in small distributions around the maximum likelihood val-
ues and then they quickly wander and start to explore the
full posterior distribution. Therefore, we can check if all the
parameters are convergent through this.

(4) After making sure all the parameters are conver-
gent, we can get marginalized distribution for each param-
eter independently in one-dimension histograms and two
dimensional projections of posterior probability distribu-
tions (see Fig. A1, Fig. A2, Fig. A3, Fig. A4, Fig. A5, Fig. A6
and Fig. A7).

(5) We choose the medians of the one-dimension pos-
terior distributions as the best ﬁtting parameters, and the
parameter uncertainties are calculated with their 68 percent
conﬁdence intervals.

(6) We need to make the projection of our result into

the corresponding observed timing residuals.

To further make sure that our best ﬁtting parameters
are credible, after getting the ﬁnal posterior distribution,
we also chose 500 samples from the time series of parame-
ters in the chain randomly to produce 500 simulated timing
residuals. The result shows that they all overlap well with
the ‘best’ simulated timing residuals, which are produced by
our best ﬁtting parameters.
