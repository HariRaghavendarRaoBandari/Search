We present a two-dimensional study of star formation at kiloparsec and sub-kiloparsec scales of a sample of local (z < 0.1) Luminous
(10) and Ultraluminous (7) Infrared Galaxies (U/LIRGs), based on near-infrared VLT-SINFONI integral ﬁeld spectroscopy (IFS).
We obtained integrated measurements of the star formation rate and star formation rate surface density, together with their 2D dis-
tributions, based on Brγ and Paα emission. In agreement with previous studies, we observe a tight linear correlation between the
star formation rate (SFR) derived from our extinction-corrected Paα measurements and that derived from Spitzer 24 µm data, and a
reasonable agreement with SFR derived from LIR. We also compared our SFRPaα values with optical measurements from Hα emission
and ﬁnd that the SFRPaα is on average a factor ∼3 larger than the SFRHα, even when the extinction corrections are applied.
Within the angular resolution and sizes sampled by the SINFONI observations, we found that LIRGs have a median-observed star
= 1.72 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 for the extinction-corrected distri-
formation rate surface density of Σobs
bution. The median-observed and the extinction-corrected ΣSFR values for ULIRGs are Σobs
=
0.23 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2, respectively. These median values for ULIRGs increase up to 1.38 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 and 2.90 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2, when
only their inner regions, covering the same size as the average FoV of LIRGs, are considered. For a given ﬁxed angular sampling, our
simulations show that the predicted median of the ΣSFR distribution increases artiﬁcially with distance, a factor ∼2-3 when the original
measurements for LIRGs are simulated at the average distance of our ULIRGs. This could have consequences on any estimates of the
star formation surface brightness in high-z galaxies, and consequently on the derivation of the universality of star formation laws at
all redshifts.
We identiﬁed a total of 95 individual star-forming clumps in our sample of U/LIRGs, with sizes that range within ∼60–400 pc and
∼300–1500 pc, and extinction-corrected Paα luminosities of ∼105–107 L(cid:12) and ∼106–108 L(cid:12) in LIRGs and ULIRGs, respectively. The
ΣSFR of the clumps presents a wide range of values within 1–90 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 and 0.1–100 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 for LIRGs and ULIRGs.
Star-forming clumps in LIRGs are about ten times larger and thousands of times more luminous than typical clumps in spiral galaxies,
which is consistent with expected photon-bounded conditions in ionized nebulae that surround young stellar clusters. Clumps in
ULIRGs have sizes similar (×0.5–1) to those of high-z clumps, having Paα luminosities similar to some high-z clumps, and about
10 times less luminous than the most luminous high-z clumps identiﬁed so far. This could be an indication that the most luminous
giant clumps in high-z star-forming galaxies are forming stars with a higher surface density rate than low-z compact ULIRGs. We
also observed a change in the slope of the L-r relation, from η = 3.04 of local samples to η = 1.88 from high-z observations. A
likely explanation is that most luminous galaxies are interacting and merging, and therefore their size represents a combination of the
distribution of the star-forming clumps within each galaxy in the system plus the additional eﬀect of the projected distance between
the galaxies. As a consequence, this produces an overall size that is larger than that of individual clumps, or galaxies (for integrated
measurements)

with new observational information from ground-based optical,
infrared (IR) and radiotelescopes, it has been possible to obtain
new insights into the physical mechanisms that govern the for-
mation of stars at all scales. Those processes spawns from the
pc scales of individual molecular clouds, kpc scales of galactic
disks to the Mpc scales of gas ﬂows onto disks or satellite objects
from the intergalactic medium (see Kennicutt & Evans 2012 for
a review). However, the hierarchy and coupling of the diﬀerent
mechanisms at diﬀerent scales are not yet well understood.

Being able to characterise the SF processes in galaxies is
crucial to understanding the so-called main sequence of star-

forming galaxies, i.e. the tight correlation observed with the spe-
ciﬁc star-formation rate (sSFR, star formation rate per unit of
stellar mass, M(cid:63)) with the stellar mass (see, e.g. Daddi et al.
2007, Elbaz et al. 2007, 2011, Rodighiero et al. 2011, Wuyts
et al. 2011). The slope and normalisation of the sSFR-M(cid:63) rela-
tion play a central role in the growth of galaxies and in the evolu-
tion of their mass function (Rodighiero et al. 2011). In addition,
spatially resolved studies of the formation of stars are essential
when answering whether the empirical Kennicutt-Schmidt law
(KS, Schmidt 1959, 1963, Kennicutt 1998) is governed by local
processes or by the global dynamics of the systems.

In this context of the cosmological evolution of the SF, the
importance of luminous (LIRGs, 1011L(cid:12)<LIR< 1012L(cid:12)) and ul-
traluminous (ULIRGs, 1012L(cid:12)<LIR< 1013L(cid:12)) infrared galaxies
has been well established in the last few decades. U/LIRGs start
to play a signiﬁcant role in the SF cosmic history of the Universe
beyond z ∼ 1 (see, e.g. P´erez-Gonz´alez et al. 2005). Previous
studies based on Spitzer and Herschel concluded that the rel-
ative contribution of ULIRGs to the star formation rate (SFR)
density of the Universe increases with redshift, and may even be
the dominant component at z ≥ 2 (P´erez-Gonz´alez et al. 2005,
Magnelli et al. 2011, 2013). These IR studies of large samples of
bright IR galaxies also reveal that the dominant contribution to
the SFR density is in the form of obscured SF, and that its con-
tribution increases with redshift (see, e.g. Magnelli et al. 2013).
The dominant power source of LIRGs and ULIRGs is likely
to be extended SF activity in the low-luminosity objects, whereas
the contribution of AGN increases with bolometric luminosity
(Farrah et al. 2007, Nardini et al. 2008, 2010, Yuan et al. 2010,
Pereira-Santaella et al. 2011, Petric et al. 2011, Alonso-Herrero
et al. 2012). In particular, local U/LIRGs, although rare in the
local Universe (see, e.g. Le Floc’h et al. 2005), are valuable can-
didates for studying extreme cases of compact SF, coeval AGN,
and their attendant feedback processes in a great amount of de-
tail, given their proximity.

The study of local LIRGs and ULIRGs using near-IR integral
ﬁeld spectroscopic techniques presents many advantages. In par-
ticular, it is possible to disentangle the 2D distribution of the SF
using high spatial resolution, and characterise spatially-resolved
individual star-forming regions. The use of near-IR wavelengths
also enables us to analyse those dust-enshrouded SF regions that
are partially or completely obscured in the optical.

In this work, we present a detailed 2D study of the
extinction-corrected, global star formation rate (SFR) and the
sub-kpc structure of the star formation rate surface density
(ΣSFR) in a local sample of LIRGs and ULIRGs, and brieﬂy dis-
cuss the eﬀect of the spatial sampling on the ΣSFR measurements.
Besides the spaxel-by-spaxel approach, we also analyse in de-
tail the properties of individual star-forming clumps, in terms of
their size and ΣSFR, and compare the results with local and high-z
clumps from other samples.

The paper is organised as follows. In Sections 2 and 3, we
brieﬂy describe the sample, observations, and data-reduction
process, which are detailed in Paper I. Section 4 contains a sum-
mary of the SFR tracers and calibrations used and details the pro-
cedures for obtaining the ΣSFR maps and characterising the star-
forming clumps. The results and analysis of the ΣSFR maps and
distributions, as well as the individual regions, are presented in
Sect. 5, whereas Sect. 6 includes a brief summary of the main re-
sults. Throughout this work we consider H0 =70 km s−1 Mpc−1,
ΩΛ = 0.70, ΩM = 0.30.

2. The sample
The sample is a subset of a larger sample (∼70 sources) of local
LIRGs and ULIRGs, as described in Arribas et al. (2008), that
covers the whole range of LIRGs and ULIRGs luminosities and
their diﬀerent morphological classes.

The SINFONI sample comprises a representative set of 17
sources that are divided in two subsamples of 10 LIRGs and 7
ULIRGs, and that cover the luminosity range of log(LIR/L(cid:12))=
11.10 − 12.43 (Table 1). The mean redshifts of the LIRGs
and ULIRGs subsets are zLIRGs = 0.014 and zULIRGs =
0.072 and their mean luminosities are log(LIR/L(cid:12))= 11.33 and
log(LIR/L(cid:12))= 12.29, respectively. For a detailed description of
the sample, see Piqueras L´opez et al. (2012) (Paper I).

3. Observations and data reduction
The seeing-limited observations of the sample were made be-
tween April 2006 and July 2008 during the periods 77B, 78B,
and 81B with SINFONI (Eisenhauer et al. 2003) on the VLT. We
made use of the K-band (1.95–2.45 µm) 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)125×0.(cid:48)(cid:48)250 pixel−1
conﬁguration of the instrument, which yields a FoV of 8”x8” by
a two-dimensional 64x64 spaxel frame for each single exposi-
tion. Owing to the jittering process and the diﬀerent pointings
used in some of the sources, the eﬀective FoV of the observa-
tions extends beyond that from ∼9”×9” to ∼12”×12”. In terms
of physical scales, the FoV typically covers a size of ∼ 3× 3 kpc
for the LIRGs and ∼ 12 × 12 kpc for the ULIRGs subsample,
with a resolution of ∼0.63 arcsec full-width-at-half-maximum
(FWHM) that corresponds, on average, to ∼0.2 kpc and ∼0.9 kpc
for LIRGs and ULIRGs, respectively. The spectral resolution of
the K-band observation is typically R∼3300, and the average
FWHM measured from the OH sky lines is 6.4 ± 0.6 Å with a
dispersion of 2.45 Å per pixel. For further details on the obser-
vations, the criteria used to select the diﬀerent pointings, and
integration times, see Paper I.

J. Piqueras L´opez et al.:: VLT-SINFONI sub-kpc study of star formation in local LIRGs and ULIRGs

For the reduction of the data, we used the ESO pipeline
ESOREX (version 3.8.3) and our own IDL routines for the ﬂux
calibration. On the individual frames we applied the usual cali-
bration corrections of dark subtraction, ﬂat ﬁelding, detector lin-
earity, geometrical distortion, wavelength calibration, and sub-
traction of the sky emission. Afterwards, the individual cubes
from each exposures were combined into a single data cube or
into a ﬁnal mosaic for those sources with several pointings.

We implemented some modiﬁcations in our reduction and
calibration process that diﬀer from Paper I. Besides using a
newer version of ESOREX, we included additional steps in the
process to reduce the spectral and spatial noise of the individ-
ual observations, and to match the background of the individ-
ual cubes before coadding the ﬁnal data cube. For the calibra-
tion of the individual cubes, we also reduced the aperture used
to measure the integrated ﬂux of the standard star, from 5σ to
3σ of the best 2D Gaussian ﬁt of its collapsed image. Although
the ﬂux measurements could be slightly aﬀected, this change
enabled us to reduce signiﬁcantly the noise in the atmospheric
transmission curves in some cases. As a consequence of the new
calibration, we observed some diﬀerences in the relative calibra-
tion between H- and K-band data cubes, compared with previous
published measurements. In the worst case scenario, these dif-
ferences could be as high as 20% on each band, whereas the un-
certainties of the absolute ﬂux calibration is, on average, below
≤ 15% in both bands. Throughout this work, we have assumed
a conservative 15% systematic error for all ﬂux measurements,
added in quadrature to the statistical error obtained from the ﬁt-
ting.

As described in Paper I, we ﬁtted a single Gaussian proﬁle
to the emission lines to obtain the maps of the Paα, Brγ, and
Brδ lines. To maximise the S/N ratio over the entire FoV, the
data were binned following a Voronoi tessellation, using the IDL
routines described in Cappellari & Copin (2003). The average
S/N of the maps varies from object to object and from line to line,
and is typically between 15-25 for the brightest line (Brγ and
Paα in LIRGs and ULIRGs, respectively), and between 8-10 for
the weakest (Brδ and Brγ for LIRGs and ULIRGs, respectively).
The individual values for the S/N thresholds used for binning the
maps can be found in Paper I.

4. Data analysis
4.1. Star formation measurements. Optical and infrared

tracers

One of the key issues regarding the measurement of the SFR is
the calibration of the SFR indicators. The UV/optical/near-IR
range indicators probe the SF by directly measuring the stel-
lar light. The young and most massive stars produce consid-
erable amount of ionising photons that ionise the surrounding
gas which, owing to recombination processes, creates line emis-
sion cascades including the Balmer, Paschen, and Brackett se-
ries. The conversion from the ﬂux of light into SFR is performed
under the assumption of a particular stellar IMF, which has to
be fully sampled (i.e. stars are formed in every mass bin), and
the SF has to be roughly constant over the time scale probed
by the speciﬁc emission used. In the present work, we focus on
the hydrogen recombination tracers that relate the intensity of a
particular emission line with the SFR through the ionising pho-
ton rate. In particular, for the Hα line, we have the well-known
calibration from Kennicutt (1998):

which assumes a Salpeter IMF from 0.1 to 100 M(cid:12) (Salpeter
1955) and solar abundances, and the star formation has to re-
main constant over ∼ 6 Myr for the expression to be applicable.
The variations of the calibration constant are ∼ 15% due to vari-
ations of the electron temperature within Te = 5000 − 20000 K
and almost negligible for electron density variations within the
range ne = 102 − 106 cm−3 (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006).
It is well known that this expression yields higher values of
SFR than those based on other IMF like Kroupa (Kroupa 2001)
or Chabrier (Chabrier 2003). The conversion factor to trans-
form the SFR calculated using these IMFs with respect to those
considering Salpeter are 1.44 and 1.59 respectively (Kennicutt
et al. 2009, Calzetti et al. 2007). From this expression, taking
the recombination factors Hα to Paα and Brγ (T= 10, 000 K and
ne = 104 cm−3, case B; Osterbrock & Ferland 2006) into ac-
count, we can directly obtain equivalent relations in terms of the
Brγ and Paα luminosities:

SFR [M(cid:12)yr−1] = 8.2 × 10−40 × LBrγ [erg s−1]
SFR [M(cid:12)yr−1] = 6.8 × 10−41 × LPaα [erg s−1].

(2)
(3)

Although these near-IR lines have the advantage of being
less aﬀected by dust attenuation, they are also progressively
fainter and more sensitive to the physical conditions of the gas
(i.e. density and temperature, Calzetti 2012). In particular, Brγ
is ∼100 times fainter than Hα, on average, and its luminosity
changes to ∼ 35% within Te = 5000 − 20000 K, whereas Paα
is ∼ 7.5 times fainter than Hα and its luminosity varies ∼ 25%
within the same temperature range. The dependence on the den-
sity is, in both cases, less than a ∼ 3% (Osterbrock & Ferland
2006).

Although hydrogen recombination lines and UV emission
represent the most traditional SFR tracers (Kennicutt 1998), in-
dicators based on dust-reprocessed stellar light have been widely
used since the advent of highly-sensitive IR space telescopes
like IRAS, Spitzer and Herschel. Among all the available IR-
continuum tracers, we focused on the LIR and monochromatic
24 µm indicators to compare them with our SFR measurements
from the near-IR hydrogen lines. In particular, we used the
total-IR-based (TIR, LIR[8–1000µm]) SFR calibration derived
by Kennicutt (1998):

SFR [M(cid:12)yr−1] = 4.5 × 10−44 × LIR [erg s−1],

(4)

which assumes a continuous burst of star formation of age 10-
100 Myr, with a completely dust-enshrouded stellar population
and dust heating that is fully dominated by young stars. The main
disadvantage of this indicator is the need to obtain multiple mea-
surements along the IR spectral energy distribution (SED) and/or
perform extrapolations.

In this sense, the monochromatic SFR indicators, like the
24µm continuum, have the advantage of only requiring a sin-
gle measurement. This tracer, as all the indicators in the mid-
IR range, is based on the continuum emission dominated by a
warm (T ≥ 50 K) dust component in thermal equilibrium and
small-grain dust heated by the absorption of individual starlight
photons (Draine 2003). Among the multiple calibrations avail-
able in the literature, we used the calibration from Rieke et al.
(2009):

SFR [M(cid:12)yr−1] = 7.9 × 10−42 × LHα [erg s−1],

(1)

SFR [M(cid:12)yr−1] = 1.2 × 10−9L24µm(7.76 × 10−11L24µm)0.048, (5)

where L24µm is expressed in [L(cid:12)]. Unlike the previous optical and
TIR tracers, several calibrators of the SFR use a non-linear rela-
tion between the luminosity at 24 µm and the SFR. These models
predict that the 24 µm luminosity increases proportionally faster
than the SFR, owing to the increasing mean dust temperature.
For a detailed description of the multiple 24µm calibrations (lin-
ear and non-linear), see Calzetti et al. (2010), and for a general
review, see Kennicutt & Evans (2012).

4.2. Integrated measurements of the star formation rate

We obtained integrated measurements of the SFR and ΣSFR by
stacking the spectra of the individual spaxels within the Hα ef-
fective radius from Arribas et al. (2012). The spectra of each in-
dividual spaxel were previously derotated, i.e. corrected from the
intrinsic large-scale velocity ﬁeld, to prevent from beam smear-
ing eﬀects, and improve the S/N of the lines. The lines were
then ﬁtted to a Gaussian proﬁle, accounting for the instrumental
broadening using the OH sky line at 2.190 µm (see Paper I, for
details).

The SFR and ΣSFR values were derived using the Brγ and
Paα emission lines for LIRGs and ULIRGs, respectively, and
Eqs. 2 and 3. These values were then corrected from extinc-
tion using the AV measurements from Piqueras L´opez et al.
(2013) (Paper II). These extinction values are obtained from the
Brγ/Brδ and Paα/Brγ line ratios for LIRGs and ULIRGs, respec-
tively, and the extinction law described in Calzetti et al. (2000)
(αBrγ = 0.096 and αPaα = 0.145, see Paper II). Calzetti’s law
has to be applied to derive ﬁrst the extinction for the stellar con-
tinuum and then obtain the extinction towards the ionized gas
using the empirical ratio f = E(B–V)stars/E(B–V)gas = 0.44, from
Calzetti et al. (2000). This might lead to signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in the AV measurements when compared with other galactic ex-
tinction laws like Fitzpatrick & Massa (1986) or Cardelli et al.
(1989), specially in the ultraviolet and optical. In addition, the
value of this ratio, f, is under debate, and it might not be con-
sidered as a constant for all type of galaxies and redshifts (e.g.
Kashino et al. 2013, Koyama et al. 2015, Pannella et al. 2015). In
the near infrared, all these extinction laws are very similar and
diﬀerences are ≤ 0.02×AV at Paα, Brδ, and Brγ wavelengths.
However, the use of a diﬀerent value of f might have an im-
pact when comparing near-IR measurements of the SFR with
those derived from Hα measurements at high-z (see Sect. 5.6).
We have investigated this eﬀect by comparing the extinction-
corrected Hα luminosities obtained assuming a higher value of
f = 0.7 (Kashino et al. 2013). For moderate AHα values (0.7–
2.1 mag, see Genzel et al. 2011 and Swinbank et al. 2012), the
extinction-corrected Hα luminosities are ∼20–50% lower than
those derived assuming a ratio of f = 0.44. Although this eﬀect
could be important for high values of AHα, the use of a diﬀerent
value of f would not have a critical impact on the conclusions of
the present work. We have then assumed that the canonical value
of f = 0.44 from Calzetti et al. (2000), derived from a sample
of low-z starburst galaxies. Observed and extinction-corrected
measurements of the ΣSFR, velocity dispersion, and AV for each
object are listed in Table 2.

4.3. Spatially-resolved star formation rate at sub-kpc scales

To obtain the extinction-corrected values of the SFR and ΣSFR
for the maps and spaxel-by-spaxel distributions, we applied the
AV correction presented in Paper II. As outlined in Paper II, the
correction is made on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis on those spax-

4

els where the weakest line (Brδ and Brγ in LIRGs and ULIRGs,
respectively) has been detected above a S/N threshold of 4. In
those spaxels, where this point-to-point correction is not avail-
able, we have used a ﬂux-weighted median value of AV.

The individual SFR uncertainties are obtained directly from
the 1σ errors in the ﬂux and in the extinction measurements.
As described in Paper II, the AV uncertainties are derived from
the error in the line ﬂuxes using Monte Carlo simulations, with
the main advantage that uncertainties take into account both the
photon noise, and the errors from the line ﬁtting or from an in-
accurate continuum determination. Since the AV measurements
are highly sensitive to the S/N of the weakest line of the ratio,
we observed an artiﬁcial increase of the corrected SFR in those
regions with low surface brightness, specially in the ULIRGs. In
regions that are typically the external regions of the sources, the
uncertainties in the AV measurements reach up to 70-80%, and
are directly propagated to the SFR measurements.

Figures B.1 and B.2 in Appendix B show the two-
dimensional structure of the extinction-corrected ΣSFR, together
with the AV map, and Brγ and Paα emission maps for LIRGs
and ULIRGs, respectively. The statistics of the spaxel-by-spaxel
distributions (i.e. median and percentiles) are shown in Table 3.
The detection limit of the emission maps varies slightly from
object
to object. We found an average sensitivity limit of
10−18 erg s−1 cm−2 per spaxel on the Brγ and Paα maps in
LIRGs and ULIRGs, respectively. Considering the closest LIRG
and ULIRG, this ﬂux threshold yields to ΣSFR observed val-
ues of ∼0.3 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 and ∼0.03 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 per spaxel
in LIRGs and ULIRGs, respectively, which are diﬀerent owing
to the use of diﬀerent tracers. Therefore, we hereafter assume
these values as our detection limits in the ΣSFR maps and spaxel-
by-spaxel distributions.

4.4. Star-forming clumps. Identiﬁcation and sizes
As shown in Figs. B.1 and B.2, the spatial distribution of the SF
is clumpy with diﬀuse as well as compact regions of high-surface
brightness. We identiﬁed a total of 95 of these individual star-
forming regions/complexes. Figure 1 shows the Brγ (LIRGs)
and Paα (ULIRGs) maps of the objects of the sample, where
the individual regions have been overplotted. Characterising the
size of an individual star-forming clump is a key issue when ac-
curately measuring important properties of the region, such as
its luminosity, velocity dispersion, and ΣSFR. Two parameters are
widely employed to characterise the size of an emitting region,
i.e. the eﬀective radius or half-light radius, reﬀ (Kennicutt 1979),
and the ‘core’ radius, rcore (Sandage & Tammann 1974).

The reﬀ is traditionally deﬁned as the radius that encloses half
of the total ﬂux of the emitting region, assuming circular sym-
metry, although it could be generalised in terms of an isopho-
tal region with arbitrary shape that encloses a total ﬂux greater
than a deﬁned fraction of light. Depending on the ﬂux threshold,
the intrinsic ﬂux distribution of the region and the sensitivity
of the observations, this radius can represent either the core of
the region or also include the surrounding diﬀuse inter-clump
emission. The presence of tails, halos, or smeared background
emission when two regions are close together increase reﬀ and,
therefore, bias the measurements. This could be particularly im-
portant when comparing low- and high-redshift samples, since
the contribution of the surrounding background could be signif-
icantly higher locally than at higher redshift.

The so-called core method consists of ﬁtting the light proﬁle
of the region using a particular analytic function, typically a 2D
Gaussian function. One of the advantages of this method is that

it does not depend on any particular ﬂux or surface brightness
threshold, and it is less sensitive to the local background. This
method is widely used for high-redshift data where the regions
are almost unresolved, and it seems suitable for a direct compar-
ison between low- and high-redshift observations. However, the

main limitation of the method is that it assumes a light proﬁle,
typically Gaussian, that might not accurately reproduce the in-
trinsic proﬁle of resolved clumps, particularly in local samples
where the spatial resolution of the observations is typically of

tenths of parsecs. For further discussion on both methods see
Wisnioski et al. (2012).
To obtain the reﬀ of the individual clumps, we considered a
ﬂux threshold of 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2 to calculate the total ﬂux of
each region. This ﬂux limit corresponds typically to a S/N ra-
tio of ∼ 2 in the Brγ and Paα lines per spaxel for LIRGs and
ULIRGs, respectively. For these isophotal regions, we estimate
the reﬀ using the A/2 method described in Arribas et al. (2012),
A/π, where A is the area cov-
i.e. the reﬀ is obtained as reﬀ =
ered by the minimum set of spaxels that accounts for half of the
total ﬂux of the region.

√

We show a comparison between the area of the isophotal re-
gion (Aiso) and the circular area derived from the reﬀ (Aeﬀ) in
Fig. 2. This relationship gives us an idea of how compact or
extended each individual region is. Following on from this, we
also plotted the expected ratio of both areas for an ideal region
with an uniform ﬂux distribution, that represents the extreme
case of an extended region with diﬀuse background emission,
and a mock region with a symmetric 2D Gaussian light pro-
ﬁle that represents a typical unresolved, compact star-forming
clump. The region with a constant ﬂux distribution represents
the lower limit for the ratio, since Aiso ∼ 2 × Aeﬀ. On the other
hand, the relationship between both areas for the mock region

would depend on the total ﬂux of the clump, the FWHM of the
2D gaussian proﬁle, and our limiting ﬂux threshold. We consid-
ered an unresolved clump with a total ﬂux of 10−13 erg s−1 cm−2
that corresponds to the total ﬂux of a typical star-forming clump
of our sample, with a FWHM of ∼0.63 arcsec and a detection
limit of 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2. Most of the clumps from the LIRG
subsample lay close to the lower limit of Aiso ∼ 2×Aeﬀ, whereas
the regions observed in the ULIRG subsample present higher ra-
tios, similar to those of more compact distributions. Although
it could be argued that this might respond to intrinsic diﬀer-
ences between the structure of star-forming clumps in LIRGs
and ULIRGs, the diﬀerences in the spatial resolution and FoV of
our observations, between both LIRG and ULIRG subsamples,
means that this conclusion is not straight-forward, and could be
a direct consequence of the distinct diﬀuse background contri-
bution in both subsamples.

To calculate rcore, we ﬁtted each individual region to a 2D
Gaussian proﬁle with the local background level as a free pa-
rameter. The ﬁnal value of the radius is obtained as a quadratic
mean of the widths of the Gaussian function, σx(cid:48) and σy(cid:48), where
x(cid:48) and y(cid:48) are the canonical axes of the ellipse.

ments. The diﬀerences in the area of the region obtained by both
methods are typically of 50-60% or less, and are translated to
diﬀerences in luminosity of ∼ 50% on average. We observed
that the AV values are less sensitive to the method used for char-
acterising the size of the clumps, and found a close one-to-one
correlation between the values measured using the eﬀective ra-
dius and the core radius, with diﬀerences lower than ∼ 20% in
AV.

5. Results and discussion

5.1. Integrated star formation: Optical vs near-IR star

formation rates.

We compared our Brγ and Paα SFR measurements with those
derived from our own IFS-based Hα measurements from Garc´ıa-
Mar´ın et al. (2009) and Rodriguez-Zaur´ın et al. (2011). Although
the SFR values for our LIRG subsample were derived from the
Brγ luminosity, these were translated to SFRPaα, assuming a Brγ
to Paα line ratio given by the corresponding Case B recombina-
tion factor.

Garc´ıa-Mar´ın et al. (2009) present optical IFS observa-
tions of 22 local ULIRG systems, and provided not only ob-
served Hα ﬂuxes of three of our ULIRGs (IRAS 12112+0305,
IRAS 14348-1447, and IRAS 17208-0014), but also spaxel-by-
spaxel extinction-corrected measurements based on the Hα/Hβ
ratio, with an angular resolution of ∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48)per spaxel. For our
LIRG subsample and the rest of the ULIRGs, we used the Hα
ﬂuxes based on VIMOS IFS observations and AV corrections
from Rodriguez-Zaur´ın et al. (2011). The AV corrections for
these objects are derived from the nuclear Hα/Hβ ratios avail-
able in the literature, based on long-slit spectroscopic observa-
tions. To account for the extinction eﬀects, these authors used
the nuclear reddening spectroscopic measurements to correct the
fraction of Hα emission within a typical slit width (∼ 2 arcsec)
and considered the remaining fraction of ﬂux not aﬀected by
extinction. As discussed in Rodriguez-Zaur´ın et al. (2011), al-
though extinction eﬀects are particularly important in the nu-
clear regions, this approach could underestimate the extinction-
corrected SFRHα values, since, as shown in Figs. B.1 and B.2, it
is also frequent to ﬁnd dusty, highly-obscured extranuclear Hα-
emitting regions in these objects.

Figure 4 shows the comparison between the optical and near-
IR-based SFR values, for observed and extinction-corrected
measurements. As expected, we found a mild correlation be-
tween the SFRHα and SFRPaα values, although the Paα mea-
surements yield larger SFR values, even for extinction-corrected
measurements. For the observed values, the SFRPaα values are
on average ∼ 3.6 times larger than SFRHα, although individual
ratios range between from ∼ 1.2 to ∼ 8. When the extinction
correction is applied, the SFRPaα/SFRHα ratio decreases to ∼ 2.9
on average, while the individual factors are constrained between
∼ 0.5 and ∼ 6.

As mentioned in Paper I, we found evidence of nuclear activ-
ity in four of the objects of the sample, i.e. IRASF 12115-4656,
NGC5135, NGC7130, and IRAS 23128-5919, in terms of de-
tection of [SiVI] coronal emission. Those objects, in particular
the three LIRGs, present the highest SFRPaα/SFRHα ratios. When
these objects are removed from the sample, the average ratios of
the SFRPaα/SFRHα becomes ∼ 3.4 and ∼ 2.0 for the observed
and extinction-corrected values.

by an isophote of 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2) and the circular area ob-
tained from the reﬀ of the individual star-forming regions in

represents the ratio between both quantities for a region with a
uniform ﬂux distribution, whereas the dashed line represents the
same ratio for a region with a symmetric 2D gaussian light pro-
ﬁle and a total ﬂux of 10−13 erg s−1 cm−2.

4.5. Star-forming clumps. Line luminosity and extinction

correction

We measured the line luminosity and visual extinction of each
clump from the stacked spectra of the individual spaxels within
the circular area deﬁned by reﬀ and by the ellipse given by σx(cid:48)
and σy(cid:48). The measurements are performed using the same proce-
dure as for the whole galaxy, we ﬁtted a Gaussian proﬁle to the
derotated stacked spectrum of each region, accounting for the
instrumental broadening, and used a spaxel-by-spaxel correction
to account for the extinction. The resulting values are shown in
Table B.1.

The measurements of the SFR and ΣSFR could also be per-
formed directly over the emission maps. We checked whether
the method, i.e. ﬁtting the stacked spectrum or synthetic aperture
photometry of the emission map, would bias the measurements.
We found that the values of the luminosity obtained directly from
the maps are slightly larger than those obtained from the line ﬁt-
ting, although the diﬀerences are less than ∼ 10%. There is also
a small dependence with the luminosity/size of the region, those
regions with small sizes/less numbers of spaxels show the largest
diﬀerences ( <∼ 10%), whereas the more extended regions present
diﬀerences between both measurements of less than ∼ 5% owing
to the larger number of spaxels within the region.

Figure 3 shows a comparison between the luminosity, ra-
dius, and visual extinction of the clumps measured using the reﬀ
and rcore methods. We found that the sizes of the clumps mea-
sured using reﬀ are typically larger than those obtained by the
core method, with diﬀerences of ∼ 30% on average, and hence,
the luminosities extracted using the eﬀective radius method yield
values larger than the corresponding ones for the rcore measure-

are also included to extend the comparison over more than four
orders of magnitude in SFRPaα.

The Paα and 24 µm tracers yield very similar SFR values
characterized by a linear relation with some deviations at the
low- and high-luminosity ends (Fig. 5, left panel). The devia-
tions at the high-luminosity end have already been reported as
being observed in previous works using diﬀerent calibrations
and datasets (Alonso-Herrero et al. 2006, Rieke et al. 2009 or
Calzetti et al. 2007) and respond to the fact that the relation
between L24µm and the SFR is no longer linear, since the in-
crease of starlight raises the dust temperature of large grains and
hence the absorbed energy reradiated at 24 µm. Besides this ef-
fect, the high-luminosity end (LIRGs and brighter) corresponds
to objects where the star formation occurs in dusty environments
with increasing density, where standard extinction corrections
(e.g. based on hydrogen recombination line ratios) become less
reliable and could lead to an underestimation of the true Paα lu-
minosity.

The comparison between the SFR derived from the Paα and
LIR luminosities (Fig. 5, right panel) shows a sub-linear relation
with SFRIR values that are systematically higher than SFRPaα. In
particular, for our sample of LIRGs and ULIRGs, the diﬀerences
are up to a factor ×2. The origin of this systematic diﬀerence is
not clear. It could be due to the fact that a fraction of the ion-
izing photons do not ionize the surrounding interstellar medium
but are directly absorbed by the dust, i.e. the SFRPaα would then
represent a lower limit to the true instantaneous SFR. On the
other hand, SFRIR is sensitive to the overall radiation ﬁeld pro-
duced by young massive ionizing stars, as well as older inter-
mediate mass, non-ionizing stars, i.e. tracing SFR over longer
time scales and, therefore, in a sense represent an upper limit
to the true instantaneous SFR. In summary, the comparison of
the near- and mid-IR SFR tracers indicate that the extinction-
corrected Paα and the 24 µm ﬂuxes give more consistent and
more reliable values of the instantaneous SFR in our galaxies.

black line represents a one-to-one ratio. The SFR has been cor-
rected using its corresponding AV correction, i.e. SFRHα is cor-
rected using optical measurements of AV, and SFRPaα is cor-
rected using the near-IR lines. The Hα luminosities are extracted
from Garc´ıa-Mar´ın et al. (2009) and Rodriguez-Zaur´ın et al.

able (Pereira-Santaella et al. 2011). In addition, diﬀerent sets

LIRGs

As discussed in Paper II, the diﬀerence in distance, and
hence in angular resolution, is a key issue when comparing the
results for LIRGs and ULIRGs, and therefore a direct interpreta-
tion is not straight-forward. The FoV of our SINFONI observa-
tions limits our analysis of the LIRGs to their innermost ∼ 3 kpc,
with a typical sampling of about 200 pc. On the other hand,
ULIRGs are located at larger distances and therefore the physi-
cal area covered by SINFONI FoV is about ×16 that for LIRGs,
covering more external regions, but sampled with a lower spatial
resolution of about 0.9 kpc.

Due to the clumpy structure of the dust and ionized gas distri-
butions, simulations have been performed to evaluate the eﬀect
of the poorer linear resolution in the derivation of ΣSFR for the
sample of LIRGs as the distance increases up to 900 Mpc (see
Appendix A for a detailed discussion). Simulations were per-
formed for both observed and extinction-corrected ΣSFR distri-
butions assuming rebinning-only and a combination of rebinning
plus additional smoothing due to PSF eﬀects. The main conclu-
sion is that there is a tendency for an increase of the ΣSFR with
the distance for as much as a factor of 2 (rebinning-only), while

the increase is in general less relevant for the rebinning+PSF
derived ΣSFR. Thus, resolution eﬀects do not explain the diﬀer-
ences observed between LIRGs and ULIRGs. These are likely
due to the diﬀerent physical area covered by the SINFONI obser-
vations, excluding the lower surface brightness external regions
for LIRGs. In fact, when comparing similar areas, the diﬀerences
tend to decrease.

We estimated an average radius, rLIRGs = 1.4 kpc, that corre-
spond to the spaxel-weighted mean of the LIRG FoVs, and con-
sidered only those spaxels from the ULIRG distribution within
this physical scales. The resulting observed and extinction-
corrected ΣSFR distributions are shown in the central panel of
Fig. 6. This set of the innermost spaxels of the ULIRG distri-
butions that corresponds to the same physical regions sampled
in the LIRGs, are ∼ 10% of the total in the ULIRG ΣSFR distri-
butions, and corresponds to those spaxels with the largest ΣSFR
values. When we consider only these values, the medians of
the observed and extinction-corrected distributions reach up to
1.38 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 and 2.90 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2, respectively, i.e. the
median extinction-corrected ΣSFR values for LIRGs and ULIRGs
are within a factor of 2.

and ΣSFR

As explained before (see Secs. 4.4 and 4.5), the sizes, line lu-
minosity and extinction-corrected ΣSFR have been derived for a
number of star-forming clumps identiﬁed in the Brγ and Paα
maps. The distribution of the radius, LPaα and ΣSFR for the sam-
ple of clumps is shown in Figure 7. The clumps have sizes in

the ∼60 to 400 pc range for LIRGs and ∼300 to 1500 pc for
ULIRGs, whereas their extinction-corrected luminosities range
correspond to ∼105–107 L(cid:12) and ∼106–108 L(cid:12) for LIRGs and
ULIRGs, respectively. These line luminosities yield ΣSFR val-
ues typically of 1–90 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 and 0.1–100 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2
for LIRG and ULIRG clumps (see Table B.1 for the speciﬁc val-
ues). As shown in Fig. 1, some of the smallest regions in the
LIRG subsample, and some of the clumps in the ULIRG subset,
are essentially unresolved, given the average spatial resolution
of our dataset (see Secs. 3 and 4.4).

The lack of clumps with ΣSFR below ∼1 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 and
LPaα∼105 L(cid:12) in LIRGs could be explained in terms of observa-
tional biases. The observed regions from the LIRG subset come
from the central kiloparsecs of the objects, and, as discussed in
4.3, our detection limit for the LIRGs is ΣSFR∼0.3 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2

per spaxel. These eﬀects bias our LIRG sample towards the de-
tection of high-luminosity, high-ΣSFR clumps.

A previous HST optical

imaging study of star-forming
clumps in LIRGs and ULIRGs identiﬁed nearly 3 000 star-
forming knots with a median radius of 32 pc for the spatially-
resolved knots, some with radii up to 200–400 pc (Miralles-
Caballero et al. 2011). Subsequent ground-based optical inte-
gral ﬁeld spectroscopy of the same sample, detected large Hα-
emitting regions identiﬁed with star-forming clumps (Miralles-
Caballero et al. 2012). Owing to the higher angular resolution
of the HST images, the structure of these Hα clumps consisted
of few star-forming knots, with an average of 2.2 per clump.
However, the structure of these clumps is, in general, quite sim-
ple. In most cases, only one bright knot is observed within the
area deﬁned for the Hα clump, or a centred bright knot plus a

few fainter knots located at the border of the clump. Only a few
clumps show a more complex knot structure, with several bright
blue knots spread inside the area of the clump (see Fig. 2 and
Table 1 in Miralles-Caballero et al. 2012).

Except for internal extinction eﬀects (i.e. diﬀerent relative
brightness), Hα traces the same star-forming clumps identiﬁed in
the Brγ and Paα maps, therefore a similar clump-knot structure
should be present in the Paα clumps. This is conﬁrmed by an
H-band and Paα study of nearby LIRGs based on HST imaging
(Alonso-Herrero et al. 2006). Some of the galaxies in common
with this sample (e.g. IC4687 or NGC7130) show that the Paα
clump is dominated by one knot and appears as more diﬀuse and
extended (i.e. the eﬀective radius of the Paα clump larger than
that of the knot).

In summary, the measured sizes and ΣSFR of the clumps
should be considered as upper and lower limits, respectively,
with the real Paα clumps more likely associated with an individ-
ual, dominant, star-forming knot, and consequently being up to
a factor 10 smaller in size, and a factor 100 larger in ΣSFR. This
could have important consequences when comparing the prop-
erties of the star-forming clumps in U/LIRGs with that of low-z
spiral galaxies and high-z star-forming galaxies. Therefore the
discussion in the following two sections is restricted to the Paα
radius-luminosity relations.

5.5. Star-forming clumps in U/LIRGs: comparison with

nearby galaxies

We compared our measurements with diﬀerent samples of star-
forming clumps in nearby galaxies. Although most of the data
from other samples correspond to Hα measurements, we con-
verted the extinction-corrected Hα luminosities into Paα lumi-
nosities using the Case B recombination factor at T= 10, 000 K
and ne = 104 cm−3 (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006) (LHα/LPaα=
8.582). Details of these diﬀerent datasets taken from the litera-
ture can be found in Table 4. Since the complete sample from
Liu et al. (2013) consisted of ∼2 000 individual clumps, we ran-
domly selected 100 individual clumps to obtain a subsample of
similar size to the other samples. To avoid any possible bias due
to sampling selection, we repeated our analysis by extracting an-
other 100 diﬀerent subsamples of the Liu et al. (2013) dataset,
and checked that our results are not biased owing to selection
eﬀects.

All the samples with the exception of Liu et al. (2013) are
based on Hα measurements. As discussed in Sect. 5.1, even
when the extinction corrections are applied, a factor of ∼2–3
diﬀerence appears to exist between the Hα- and Paα-based SFR
measurements in LIRGs and ULIRGs. This eﬀect could be even
larger when the correction from extinction is less accurate, such
as object-averaged corrections, AV measurements from diﬀerent
datasets, or SED ﬁtting. Although the uncertainties of the ex-
tinction could be intrinsically large, the diﬀerent methods used
would yield additional sources of uncertainties when comparing
the diﬀerent datasets. To account for this eﬀect, we used an addi-
tional average factor of 2.9 to translate the extinction-corrected
Hα luminosities into Paα luminosities. The results are presented
in Fig. 8.

The slope of the L-r relation is usually interpreted in terms
of physical properties of the star-forming regions. If we assume
that the regions are photon-bounded, they can be represented by
a Str¨omgren sphere and their L-r relation is in the form LPaα ∼ rη,
with η = 3. The deviations from this model could result from a
variety of factors, both physical and observational. If the regions
are density-bounded, i.e. the hydrogen atoms recombine faster

than they are ionised and some ionising photons escape, a shal-
lower slope of the L-r is expected, since regions turn out to be
less luminous at a given radius (Wisnioski et al. 2012). Beckman
et al. (2000) present a detailed discussion of this transition and
>∼ 105 L(cid:12)beyond which re-
propose a luminosity threshold of LPaα
gions turn out to be density-bounded. Nevertheless, the exponent
of this relation is subject to variations that could be unrelated to
the intrinsic physical properties of the HII regions and are likely
to be induced by observational biases as region-blending or low
S/N ratio of the clumps. In addition, the diﬀerent spatial resolu-
tion of the local and high-z observations might also contribute
to change the slope of the L-r relation (Scoville et al. 2001, Liu
et al. 2013). Despite this observational bias, the use of either Hα
or Paα data to perform the analysis seems to have little impact
on η (Liu et al. 2013).

As shown in Fig. 8, if we compare the ΣSFR and LPaα of our
LIRG regions, we ﬁnd that they have higher luminosity densities
than clumps in local so-called normal galaxies, although they
seem to be similar to the regions from the ongoing spiral-spiral
merger of the Antennae (Bastian et al. 2006). This is consis-
tent with previous results (e.g. Alonso-Herrero et al. 2002) who
found that U/LIRGs show a large fraction of giant HII regions
that are not just aggregations of normal HII regions.
The blue line in the left panel of Fig. 8 correspond to the
power law ﬁtting LPaα ∼ rη to the local points, i.e. U/LIRGs and
local samples, which yields an exponent of η = 3.04 and a corre-
lation coeﬃcient of r = 0.967. This value is in very good agree-
ment with what would be expected for photon-bounded regions,
represented by Str¨omgren spheres. However, there seems to be a
clear change on the slope at r∼ 60 pc, which corresponds approx-
imately to LPaα∼ 105 L(cid:12), and which coincides with the proposed
luminosity threshold from photon- to density-bounded regions.
Although the lack of low-luminosity regions in our sample pre-
cludes a more detailed analysis of this transition using a consis-
tent dataset, the combination of the diﬀerent samples points to a
change in the regime around LPaα∼ 105 L(cid:12).
We combined our sample of clumps and galaxies with the
more general sample from Arribas et al. (2014) of local LIRGs
and ULIRGs observed in the optical. When only LIRGs and
ULIRGs are considered, star-forming regions seem to be signif-
icantly more luminous than predicted for their radius range and
the resulting slope of the L-r relation yields η ∼ 2.02 (correla-
tion coeﬃcient of r = 0.895), which is therefore compatible with
density-bounded regions.

5.6. Star-forming clumps in U/LIRGs: comparison with high-z

giant star-forming clumps and SMGs

We investigate how the observed properties of the star-forming
clumps in U/LIRGs compare with those detected in high-z lumi-
nous star-forming galaxies. In particular, a comparison is made
with the giant star-forming clumps and the integrated properties
for a sample of sub-millimeter galaxies (SMG). The details for
these high-z samples taken from the literature are summarized in
Table 4. As discussed in Appendix A and previous sections, the
spatial resolution of the data could be playing a role in deriving
the observed properties. Although we explored this eﬀect at low
redshifts (z < 0.2), our dataset is not well suited to study and
simulate the eﬀect of distance at higher redshifts, given the lim-
ited FoV of our SINFONI observations. Therefore, we restricted
the comparison at clump level only for the AO-based samples of
Genzel et al. (2011), Swinbank et al. (2012), and the z∼2 star-
forming clump of Zanella et al. (2015), while a comparison of
the integrated properties of galaxies is considered only for our

Star-forming clumps in LIRGs appear as signiﬁcantly (∼3-
20 times) smaller than the kpc-size clumps detected so far in
high-z galaxies, and up to 1 000 times less luminous. On the
other hand, clumps in ULIRGs have sizes similar (×0.5–1) to
those of high-z clumps, having Paα luminosities similar to some
high-z clumps (Swinbank et al. 2012) and about ten times less

luminous than the most luminous high-z clumps identiﬁed so far
(Genzel et al. 2011). These results suggest that the giant clumps
in high-z star-forming galaxies appear to be forming stars with
a higher surface density rate than ULIRGs, and in particular
LIRGs. This could be the consequence of a higher molecular
gas surface density in high-z galaxies, and therefore a higher
star formation rate than expected, if the empirical Kennicutt-
Schmidt law that seems valid on a galaxy scale also applies at
the (sub)kpc scales in the highly luminous and dense environ-

6. Summary
We presented a detailed 2D study of star formation in a repre-
sentative sample of local LIRGs and ULIRGs, based on VLT-
SINFONI IFS K-band observations. The data sample the inner
∼ 3 × 3 kpc and ∼ 12 × 12 kpc in LIRGs and ULIRGs, respec-
tively, with an average linear resolution of ∼0.2 kpc and ∼0.9 kpc
(FWHM), respectively. The analysis of the SFR and ΣSFR is per-
formed using a spaxel-by-spaxel extinction correction, based on
measurements of the Brγ/Brδ and Paα/Brγ line ratios for LIRGs
and ULIRGs, respectively (Paper II).

The integrated near-IR based SFR of the objects of our sam-
ple has been compared with optical, mid-IR and LIR-based mea-
surements. We found that the observed SFRHα and SFRPaα val-
ues diﬀer by a factor of ∼3.6 on average, and that the diﬀer-
ence decreases slightly when the extinction correction is applied,
up to SFRHα/SFRPaα∼2.9. In agreement with previous studies,
we observed a tight linear correlation between the extinction-
corrected SFRPaα and the 24 µm measurements from Spitzer and
a reasonable agreement with SFR values from LIR, with diﬀer-
ences of up to factors 2-3.

We obtained 2D ΣSFR maps and spaxel-by-spaxel distribu-
tions of individual galaxies (Figs. B.1 and B.2). We found that,
in a signiﬁcant fraction of the objects (∼57 %), the corrected
ΣSFR peaks either at the main or secondary nucleus of the sys-
tems, and that the extinction correction typically increases the
median of the distributions by ∼50 %. Within the angular res-
olution and sizes sampled by the SINFONI observations, we
found that the LIRG subsample has median observed star for-
= 1.16 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 and

= 0.16 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2
ΣSFR values for ULIRGs are Σobs
= 0.23 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2, respectively. These median
and Σcorr
values for ULIRGs increase by up to 1.38 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 and
2.90 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 when only their inner regions, covering the
same size as the average FoV of LIRGs, are considered.

The spatial sampling (i.e. physical scale per spaxel) of the
observations shapes not only the AV structure (Paper II) but also
the ΣSFR distributions. Our simulations of the ΣSFR maps of the
LIRGs at increasing distances show that the predicted median
of the ΣSFR distributions is artiﬁcially increased by the poorer
sampling of the maps. At the average distance of the ULIRG
subsample (328 Mpc), the computed median of the LIRG ob-
served and extinction-corrected ΣSFR distributions is a factor ∼2–
3 larger than the original measurements. This has consequences
for any estimates of star formation surface brightness in high-z
galaxies and, consequently, on the derivation of the universality
of star formation laws at all redshifts.

We identiﬁed a total of 95 individual star-forming clumps
in the Brγ and Paα emission maps of LIRGs and ULIRGs.
These regions present a range of sizes from ∼60 to 400 pc and
from ∼300 to 1500 pc in LIRGs and ULIRGs, with Paα lu-
minosities of ∼105–107 L(cid:12) and ∼106–108 L(cid:12), respectively. The
ΣSFR of the clumps presents a wide range of values within
1–90 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 and 0.1–100 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 for LIRGs and
ULIRGs.

Star-forming clumps in LIRGs are about ten times larger
and a thousand times more luminous than typical clumps in
spiral galaxies, consistent with expected photon-bounded con-

ments of U/LIRGs and/or high-z galaxies. However, a recent
analysis of the star-forming clumps in the low-z LIRG IC 4687,
combining ALMA CO measurements with Paα HST imaging
on scales of 250 pc (Pereira-Santaella et al. 2016), shows a large
scatter in the Paα luminosity for a given mass of molecular gas,
i.e. an eﬀective break of the KS law at (sub)kpc scales in the
high (500–2500 M(cid:12) pc−2) H2 surface-density regions present in
this galaxy. In practice, this indicates the coexistence of massive
clumps of molecular gas that have been actively forming stars
over the last few million years, with others that could form stars
on longer time scales but at a much lower rate than expected.
Moreover, some clumps with a relatively low molecular gas sur-
face density appear to be forming stars at rates similar to those
of the most dense clumps. The slope of the L-r relation of the
U/LIRGs and high-z clumps is η ∼ 1.88, and a correlation co-
eﬃcient of r = 0.890. The large scatter in the Paα luminosity
among the high-z clumps (Fig. 8) could indicate a similar break-
ing of the KS law at high-z. The sample of high-z clumps is,
however, still very limited and consists of a few clumps in lumi-
nous (SFR ∼ 120–290 M(cid:12) yr−1, Genzel et al. 2011), and fainter
(SFR∼16 M(cid:12) yr−1, Swinbank et al. 2012) extended star-forming
disks. A proper comparison of low- and high-z luminous star-
forming galaxies with larger samples is required to investigate
more deeply the diﬀerences of the star formation on (sub)kpc
scales.

The size and Paα luminosity of star formation in low-z
ULIRGs on galaxy scales is compared with that of high-z galax-
ies (Fig. 8), including extended disks (Swinbank et al. 2012)
and mergers (Alaghband-Zadeh et al. 2012). Galaxies have sizes
between 1 to 10 kpc, from the most compact star-forming re-
gions to interacting galaxies, where the global size is the com-
bined luminosity of the system, and it is therefore aﬀected by
the projected distance of the galaxies involved in the interac-
tion/merger and the distribution of the giant clumps within each
of the galaxies. Taking this into account, low-z mergers (i.e. lo-
cal ULIRGs) appear to be slightly more compact than the high-z

Once the simulated maps are built, we followed the same
procedure as described in Sect. 4 to obtain a spaxel-by-spaxel
AV correction, and ﬁnally an extinction-corrected ΣSFR distribu-
tion. As discussed in Paper II, we typically sample the innermost
∼3×3 kpc of the LIRGs, i.e. ∼Reﬀ. Since the average distance
of the ULIRG subsample is ×10 larger, the whole FoV of the
LIRGs are equivalent to ∼1” of the ULIRG FoV, i.e. ∼8 spaxels.
These limitations and the lack of information about the external
regions of the LIRGs makes the extrapolation to larger distances
to be not straight-forward.

The evolution of the median values of the simulated ΣSFR
observed and corrected distributions is shown in Fig. A.1. We
observe a clear increment of the median ΣSFR with increasing
distance in both the observed and corrected distributions, up
to ∼90% at 328 Mpc, the average distance of the ULIRG sub-
sample. We observe that, in most cases, the predicted median
of the LIRG distribution is slightly higher than the median of
the ULIRG distribution. However, there is good agreement be-
tween both quantities when the extinction correction is applied
and the PSF eﬀects are taken into account. Although the simula-
tions are a ﬁrst-order approximation, this result suggests that the
ΣSFR measurements of the ULIRGs may be aﬀected by such dis-
tance eﬀects and a further investigation is needed to characterise
these eﬀects in detail.

Appendix B: Figures and tables

ditions in ionized nebulae that surround young stellar clusters.
Clumps in ULIRGs have sizes similar (×0.5–1) to those of high-
z clumps, having Paα luminosities similar to some high-z clumps
(Swinbank et al. 2012) and about 10 times less luminous than
the most luminous high-z clumps identiﬁed so far (Genzel et al.
2011). This could be an indication that the most luminous giant
clumps in high-z star-forming galaxies could be forming stars
with a higher surface density rate than low-z compact ULIRGs.
We also observed a change in the slope of the L-r relation,
from η = 3.04 of local samples to η = 1.88 from high-z ob-
servations. A likely explanation is that most luminous galaxies
are interacting and mergers and, therefore, their size represents
a combination of the distribution of the star-forming clumps
within each galaxy in the system, plus the additional eﬀect of
the projected distance between the galaxies, therefore producing
an overall larger size than that of individual clumps or galaxies
(for integrated measurements).

Appendix A: The effect of the linear resolution on
the ΣSFR measurements. Implications for high-z
galaxies

Owing to the clumpy structure of the dust observed in LIRGs
and ULIRGs at sub-kiloparsec and kiloparsec scales, the mea-
surement of internal extinction, and subsequent derived quanti-
ties, could be aﬀected by the physical scale of the observations
at increasing distance (Paper II). Fig. B.1 shows that the mor-
phology of the ionized gas within the inner ∼3×3 kpc in LIRGs
is mainly in the form of nuclear star formation rings, emission
associated with the nucleus of the galaxy, and bright HII regions
with typical sizes of a few hundred parsecs (see also Alonso-
Herrero et al. 2006), some of them barely resolved in our ob-
servations. In addition, the AV maps show that dust seems to be
distributed in a patchy and clumpy structure at the same sub-
kiloparsec scales. As shown in Fig. B.2, ULIRGs show a more
compact morphology of both dust and ionized gas phases, with
unresolved structures beyond <∼ 1 kpc, which suggests that the
reduced linear resolution of the observations might play a role in
shaping the gas and dust distributions.

To probe how the diﬀerences in the pixel scale might bias
the ΣSFR measurements, we simulated the Brγ and Brδ maps of
the LIRGs at increasing distances. We performed two diﬀerent
sets of simulations, the ﬁrst set considers only the eﬀect of the
decreasing spatial sampling of the maps, whereas the second set
also takes the smearing eﬀect owing to the seeing into account.
In the ﬁrst set of simulations, we rebinned each individual map
as if it was observed at increasing distances with the same in-
strument set-up. The simulated maps are therefore sampled by
a decreasing number of spaxels with a constant angular resolu-
tion of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)125 per spaxel, as the original maps. The rebinning
process is performed using the basic equations of angular di-
ameter distance and luminosity distance and assuring that the
total luminosity within the FoV is conserved. In the second set
of simulations, before the rebinning process, we considered the
eﬀect of the seeing to obtain more realistic emission maps that
could be directly compared with our SINFONI observations of
the ULIRG subsample. The resulting maps presents the same
spatial sampling and scale as those from the ﬁrst set of simula-
tions, but with a ∼0.63 arcsec (FWHM) seeing as in the original
observations. Finally, in both sets of simulations, we have re-
moved those spaxels with ﬂux below 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2from our
maps, which corresponds to the detection limit of our original
observations (see Sect. 4.3).

Fig. B.2a: IRAS 06206-6315. Top panels show the AV map derived from the Paα at 1.876µm and Brγ at 2.166µm line ratio, the observed maps of the Paα emission,
together with the star formation rate surface density (ΣSFR) map, corrected from extinction. Units are [mag], log[erg s−1 cm−2], and [M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2], respectively.
The nucleus and Paα peak are marked with a plus sign (+) and a diamond ((cid:94)), respectively. The main nucleus is deﬁned as the brightest spaxel of the SINFONI
K-band image (Paper I), and the Brγ (Paα) peak corresponds to the brightest spaxel of the corresponding emission map. Bottom left panel shows the observed (blue
histogram) and the corrected-from-extinction (yellow histogram) ΣSFR spaxel-by-spaxel distributions. The relationship between the corrected ΣSFR values and the
AV is shown in the bottom right panel only for those points with a spaxel-by-spaxel correction of the extinction. The blue histograms show the projected distribution
onto each axis and are arbitrarily normalised, whereas the blue lines are the median of each distribution.
