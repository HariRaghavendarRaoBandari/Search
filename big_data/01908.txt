For dimensions d ď 9, it follows from the work of Heinz, Pecher, Brenner, and von Wahl
that one has smooth solutions to this equation for any smooth choice of initial data.
Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this result is almost sharp, in the sense that for any

with all derivatives bounded, for which the above equation admits solutions that blow
up in ﬁnite time. The intermediate case d “ 10 remains open.

1. Introduction

This paper is concerned with nonlinear wave systems of the form

(1.1)
involving a vector-valued ﬁeld u : R1`d Ñ Rm on Minkowski spacetime R1`d with
, where the ﬁeld u : R1`d Ñ Rm is vector-valued,
d’Alembertian l :“ ´B2
and f : Rm Ñ Rm is a smooth function with all derivatives bounded and fp0q “ 0. A
typical example of such a system is the higher-dimensional sine-Gordon equation

Suppose we are given an initial position u0 : R1`d Ñ Rm and an initial velocity u1 : R1`d Ñ
Rm, which are smooth and compactly supported. Standard energy methods (see e.g.
[8, §1.4]) show that for any such data, there is a unique time 0 ă T˚ ď 8 and a smooth
solution u : r0, T˚q ˆ Rd Ñ Rm to (1.1), compactly supported in space for each time t,
such that up0, xq “ u0pxq and Btup0, xq “ u1pxq; furthermore, if T˚ ă 8, the solution
u cannot be smoothly extended to the time t “ T˚ (in fact the norm }uptq}L8
x pRdq must
go to inﬁnity as t Ñ T ´˚ ). We say that the equation (1.1) enjoys global regularity if the
maximal time of existence T˚ is inﬁnite for any choice of smooth, compactly supported
initial data u0, u1. Actually, due to ﬁnite speed of propagation (see e.g. [10, Proposition
3.3]), the requirement that u0 and u1 be compactly supported can be dropped without
aﬀecting the global regularity property.

The equation (1.1) is an extremely “subcritical” semilinear wave equation, since the
nonlinearity f exhibits no growth whatsoever at inﬁnity. As a consequence, there are
plenty of a priori bounds one can place on solutions to (1.1) with smooth compactly
supported initial data. For instance, suppose T˚ were ﬁnite. From ﬁnite speed of
propagation we see that uptq is supported in a ﬁxed compact region for all times t P
xpr0, T˚q ˆ Rdqq, which from (1.1) and
r0, T˚q. In particular, fpuq lies in the space L8
xpr0, T˚qˆRdq. From the chain
the energy inequality shows that u lies in the space L8

where p∇Rmfqpvq : Rm Ñ Rm is the derivative of f : Rm Ñ Rm at a point v P Rm, we
t H 1pr0, T˚qˆRdq, and hence that u lies in the space
then conclude that fpuq also lies in L8
xpr0, T˚qˆ Rdq. In the case of very low dimensions d ď 3, Sobolev embedding then
L8

gives an L8
x bound on u which, when combined with energy methods, is suﬃcient to
establish global regularity.

t L8

Naively one might expect to keep iterating the above procedure to handle arbitrarily
large dimensions, but complications arise from the lower order terms in the iterated chain
rule (or Faa di Bruno formula), which can ultimately be “blamed” on the phenomenon
that fpuq may oscillate at signiﬁcantly higher frequencies than u. For instance, the
second derivative of fpuq is given by the formula

where we do not specify exactly how to contract the various tensors displayed in this
equation against each other for sake of exposition. The existing L8
t H 2
x bound on u
allows us to place the lower order term p∇2Rmfqpuq∇xu∇xu in L8
x in four and fewer
dimensions thanks to Sobolev embedding, but this is not immediately obvious in higher
dimensions, so one cannot immediately upgrade the regularity of u to L8
x. Never-
theless, by increasingly sophisticated arguments [3], [12], [5], [6], [7], [1], [2] in more
complicated function spaces (such as Besov spaces), global regularity for (1.1) was es-
tablished in dimensions d ď 9. Strictly speaking, the hypotheses on m and f in the
above references were somewhat diﬀerent in these references than those provided here
(in particular, f was allowed to exhibit some growth at inﬁnity), but the arguments can
be adapted to handle the setting under discussion; for the convenience of the reader we
give such an argument in Appendix A.
The main result of this paper is to show that the condition d ď 9 in these previous
results is not merely technical, but is in fact nearly the correct threshold:
Theorem 1.1 (Finite time blowup in high dimensions). Let d ě 11 and m ě 2 be
integers. Then there exists a smooth function f : Rm Ñ Rm with all derivatives bounded,
and a smooth solution u : p0, κs ˆ Rd Ñ Rm to (1.1) for some κ ą 0 which cannot be
smoothly continued to the spacetime origin p0, 0q.

Applying time reversal symmetry and then shifting this solution in time by κ, and
using ﬁnite speed of propagation to smoothly truncate the initial data to be compactly
supported, we see that global regularity for (1.1) fails in eleven and higher dimensions
for general nonlinearities f . Somewhat frustratingly, neither the positive or negative

results in this paper seem to extend to cover the intermediate case d “ 10, which
remains open. The argument in Theorem 1.1 uses the strong Huygens principle in
eleven dimensions, which is unavailable in ten dimensions, but this is most likely only
a technical restriction. More seriously, and as we shall see shortly, the numerology of
exponents used in Theorem 1.1 cannot satisfy all the constraints required for a consistent
blowup ansatz in dimensions ten and lower.
Our methods do not extend to m “ 1, basically because we cannot get any good
injectivity properties of u in this case, even after using spherical symmetry to perform a
dimensional reduction. In particular, Theorem 1.1 does not directly establish ﬁnite time
blowup for the model equation lu “ sin u in eleven and higher dimensions. However,
they provide a barrier to any attempt to prove global regularity for such an equation, by
showing that such an attempt can only be successful if it genuinely uses some additional
property of this model equation that is not shared by the more general systems (1.1).

We now give an informal and non-rigorous description of the numerology underlying
Theorem 1.1, with several of the notions in this description (such as the interpretation of
the « symbol) deliberately left vague. For sake of this discussion let us restrict attention
to the sine-Gordon equation lu “ sin u in d spatial dimensions. The blowup ansatz we
will use is as follows: for each frequency Nj in a sequence 1 ă N1 ă N2 ă N3 ă . . .
of large quantities going to inﬁnity, there will be a spacetime “cube” Qj “ tpt, xq : t „

j Ñ 8 as j Ñ 8, this will create a singularity
with the uncertainty principle. Since N α

oscillation of u on Qj driven primarily by the forcing term sin u at Qj´1. Thus, by
Duhamel’s formula, we expect a relation roughly of the form

or equivalently if d ě 11.

To turn this ansatz into an actual blowup example, we will construct u as the sum of
various functions uj that solve the wave equation with forcing term in Qj`1, and which
concentrate in Qj with the amplitude and frequency indicated by the above heuristic
analysis; see Figure 1. The remaining task is to show that lu can be written in the
form fpuq for some f with all derivatives bounded. For this one needs some injectivity
properties of u (after imposing spherical symmetry to impose a dimensional reduction
on the domain of u from d ` 1 dimensions to 1 ` 1). This requires one to construct
some solutions to the free wave equation that have some unusual restrictions on the
range (for instance, we will need a solution taking values in the plane R2 that avoid one
quadrant of that plane). Such solutions will be constructed in Section 3.

Remark 1.2. Our nonlinearity f is non-Hamiltonian (or non-Lagrangian) in the sense
that it is not of the form f “ ∇F for some smooth potential function F : Rm Ñ R. The
requirement that f be Hamiltonian would impose an additional constraint

cone.

on the solution u (which arises from the Clairaut identity BαBβFpuq “ BβBαFpuq). We
believe though that for suﬃciently large m, one can adapt the construction here (in
combination with the Nash embedding theorem, as in [11]) to ensure that the solution
u obeys this constraint, and to thus obtain a Hamiltonian counterexample for Theorem
1.1 in eleven and higher dimensions. We will not pursue this matter here.

Remark 1.3. The positive results established in Appendix A rely on Strichartz esti-
mates, while the negative results involve solutions for which the Strichartz estimates are
not sharp; this is related to the fact that the solution component uj that we construct
in our proof of Theorem 1.1 does not occupy all of Qj´1, but is instead concentrated
near a light cone (see Figure 1), thus “wasting a dimension” in some sense. This may
potentially explain the gap between the positive and negative results.
In any event,
closing the gap in the positive direction seems to require estimates that go beyond
the Strichartz estimates, whereas closing the gap in the negative direction may require
constructions of solutions in which the Strichartz estimates are closer to being sharp.

Remark 1.4. It is possible that one could extend the positive results in Appendix A
to slightly higher dimensions, such as d “ 10 or d “ 11, if one imposes some additional
Rmfpxq| Àj
decay on higher derivatives of f at inﬁnity, e.g.
p1 ` |x|q´j for all x P Rm, or even requiring that f be compactly supported. This
would go a fair way towards eliminating, or at least attenuating, the blowup ansatz
used in Theorem 1.1. However, the fundamental issue remains in this setting that

the nonlinearity fpuq can still oscillate at a signiﬁcantly higher frequency than u itself
(although now this oscillation will be largely conﬁned to a small neighbourhood of the
zero set tu “ 0u of u), and it does not appear likely that the positive results can
be extended to arbitrarily high dimension even with such strong hypotheses on the
nonlinearity.

1.1. Notation. We use |x| to denote the Euclidean norm of a vector x. If f : R Ñ Rm
is a smooth function, we use fpjq : R Ñ Rm to denote the jth derivative of f .
We use X À Y , Y Á X, or X “ OpY q to denote the estimate |X| ď CY for an absolute
constant C, and X „ Y to denote the estimates X À Y À X. We will often require the
implied constant C in the above notation to depend on additional parameters, which we
will indicate by subscripts (unless explicitly omitted), thus for instance X Àj Y denotes
an estimate of the form |X| ď CjY for some Cj depending on j.

2. A lemma on spherically symmetric functions

We will be working with smooth spherically symmetric functions u : I ˆ Rd Ñ Rm on
various intervals I, that is to say functions upt, xq that depend only on the time t and
on the magnitude r “ |x| of the spatial variable. As is well known, one can perform
a dimensional reduction, using the coordinates pt, rq “ pt,|x|q instead of pt, xq, to view
such functions as functions on the strip I ˆ r0,`8q rather than I ˆ Rd. But when
one does so, one creates a degeneracy at the time axis r “ 0; more precisely, smooth
spherically symmetric functions u must necessarily have a vanishing gradient ∇xupt, 0q
at the spatial origin, which makes Brupt, rq vanish at r “ 0. This vanishing of the
ﬁrst derivative is undesirable for our applications, as we will need to invert the map u
near the time axis using the inverse function theorem. Because of this, it will be more
convenient to work with the variable y :“ r2 “ |x|2 rather than r. In this section we give
some simple calculus lemmas that manage this change of variables. We begin with the
one-dimensional scalar case d “ m “ 1, in which case spherical symmetry just means
that the functions involved are even functions of the spatial variable x.
Lemma 2.1 (One-dimensional spherically symmetric functions). Let f : R Ñ R be a
smooth even function obeying the bounds

(2.1)
for all j ě 0 and x P R. Let F : r0,`8q Ñ R be the function deﬁned by setting
Fpx2q :“ fpxq for all x P R. Then F is smooth and

(2.2)

It is possible to reverse the implication and deduce (2.1) from (2.2), but we will not
need to do so here. The factor y1{2 in (2.2) naturally arises from the chain rule, since
dx “ 2y1{2 when y “ x2; the hypothesis that f is even gives an improvement in the
range |y| ď 1 by replacing y1{2 with 1.

dy

Proof. Clearly F is smooth away from 0. By the fundamental theorem of calculus it
suﬃces to prove the uniform bounds (2.2) for y ą 0. We do this by induction on j. The
j “ 0 case is trivial, so suppose that j ě 1 and the claim has already been proven for
j ´ 1. Diﬀerentiating the identity Fpx2q “ fpxq, we have

for any x. As f is even, f1 vanishes at zero, hence f1pxq “ x

The function ˜f : x ÞÑ 1

inequality, all the derivatives of ˜f are bounded. Applying the induction hypothesis with
j replaced by j ´ 1 and f replaced by ˜f , we obtain the bound

which gives the claim when y ď 1.
It remains to establish (2.2) in the region 2k ď y ď 2k`1 for any k ě 0. From (2.3) we
have

F 1px2q “ 2´k{2´1 ηp x
2k{2q

for 2k ď x2 ď 2k`1 and some smooth even cutoﬀ function η : R Ñ R that equals
one on r´2,´1s Y r1, 2s and vanishes outside of r´4,´1{2s Y r1{2, 1{4s. The function
2k{2 q
fk : x ÞÑ ηp x
x{2k{2 f1pxq is smooth and even, and by (2.1) and the product rule has all
derivatives bounded. Applying the induction hypothesis with j replaced by j ´ 1 and
f replaced by fk, we obtain the bound

|F pjqpyq| Àj 2´k{2´1p1 ` y1{2q´pj´1q

for 2k ď y ď 2k`1, which gives (2.2) as required.

(cid:3)

Now we may easily generalise to higher dimensions:
Corollary 2.2. Let I Ă R be an interval, let d, m ě 1, and let u : I ˆ Rd Ñ Rm be a
smooth spherically symmetric function obeying the bounds

be the function deﬁned by setting Upt,|x|2q :“ upt, xq for all pt, xq P I ˆ Rd. Then U is

(2.5)

Again, one can establish a converse to this claim, but we will not need to do so here.

Proof. We can rescale A “ B “ C “ 1. By breaking into components we may assume
m “ 1. By restricting to the plane tpt, x1e1q : t P I, x1 P Ru we may assume that d “ 1.
(cid:3)
The claim then follows by applying Lemma 2.1 to u and its time derivatives.

3. A solution to the free wave equation

To prove Theorem 1.1, it is clear that we can restrict to the case m “ 2, since the general
case m ě 2 can then be established by embedding R2 in Rm (and trivially extending
the nonlinearity f from R2 to Rm). Similarly, we can restrict to the case d “ 11, as the
d ą 11 case then follows by adding dummy spatial variables.
To build the solution u in the case d “ 11, m “ 2, we will need a certain “non-
degenerate” solution v : R1`11 Ñ R2 to the free wave equation lv “ 0, which is easy
to construct when there are at least two degrees of freedom and the number of spatial
dimensions is odd. We begin by constructing a scalar solution with a certain unusual
positivity property.

Proposition 3.1 (Scalar free wave). Let d be an odd natural number. Then there exists
a smooth spherically symmetric solution v1 : R1`d Ñ R to the free wave equation

lv1 “ 0

which is compactly supported in space for each time, and obeys the following additional
properties:

(i) There exists ε ą 0 such that v1pt, xq is strictly positive whenever t ě 0 and
(ii) The derivatives Btv1p0, 0q, Bttv1p0, 0q, and1 Byv1p0, 0q are negative.

t ´ ε ď |x| ď t ` ε. (In particular, v1p0, 0q is strictly positive.)

We remark in connection with the requirement (i) that in dimensions d “ 1, 3 it is easy
to make v1 non-negative everywhere due to the positivity of the fundamental solution
in this setting. However, as is well known, in higher (odd) dimensions the fundamental
solution contains derivatives, and it turns out not to be possible to ensure that v1 is non-
negative everywhere while still being compactly supported in space. Fortunately, for our
application to Proposition 3.2 below, we can “retreat” to a neighbourhood of the light
1Strictly speaking, one should write ByV1p0, 0q here instead of Byv1p0, 0q, where V1 : Rˆr0,`8q Ñ R

cone |x| “ t for the purposes of retaining positivity. It may be possible to extend this
proposition to even dimensions d, perhaps by combining the proof techniques below
with the method of descent, but we will not pursue this matter here (since we will
ultimately only need the d “ 11 case in any event).

Proof. Writing (by abuse of notation) v1pt, xq “ v1pt, rq with r “ |x|, we see that
v1 : R ˆ R Ñ R needs to be smooth, even in r and obey the equation

We set Ppxq :“ p´1qkxk´1 and R : r0,`8q Ñ R to be any smooth function with
Rpxq “ p´1qk´1 1
x for all x ě 1, and Rpk´1qpxq ą 0 for all x ě 0; such a function
: r0,`8q Ñ R to be any positive smooth
is easily constructed by choosing Rpk´1q
function with Rpk´1qpxq “ pk´1q!
for x ě 1, and then integrating Rpk´1q k ´ 1 times
from inﬁnity to obtain R. This deﬁnes g1 on r0,`8s, which vanishes on r1,`8q;
we integrate this and then extend in a suitable fashion to the real line to obtain a
smooth compactly supported g : R Ñ R whose associated function v1 given by (3.1)
is positive on the diagonal tpx{2, x{2q : x ě 0u. Also, from construction we have
gpkqp0q “ P pk´1qp0q “ p´1qkpk ´ 1q!; inserting this into (3.2) we see that

for any ε ą 0, any t that is suﬃciently large depending on ε, and any r between t ´ ε

small enough, this gives the conclusion (i) for suﬃciently large t, and the conclusion for
smaller t follows from the positivity of v1 on the diagonal and continuity (shrinking ε
as necessary).

Finally, if we diﬀerentiate (3.1) in time we obtain

Since Rpk´1q was chosen arbitrarily near zero (subject to being smooth and positive), we
can easily ensure that Rpkqp0q and Rpk`1qp0q are negative, giving (ii) (since Byv1p0, 0q “

(cid:3)
Now we add a second component v2 to v1 to obtain a vector-valued solution v : R1`d Ñ
R2 to the wave equation obeying some technical conditions, mostly relating to the range
of v (see Figure 2).

Proposition 3.2 (Vector-valued free wave). Let d be an odd natural number. Then
there exists a smooth spherically symmetric solution v : R1`d Ñ R2 to the free wave
equation

lv “ 0

which is compactly supported in space for each time, and obeys the following additional
properties:

(iii) If we write v “ pv1, v2q, then v1p0, 0q and v2p0, 0q are both positive. Furthermore,
for any pt, xq P R1`d, we have either v1pt, xq ě 0 or v2pt, xq ě 0 (thus v avoids
the lower left quadrant of R2).
(iv) If we let V : Rˆr0,`8q Ñ R2 be the function deﬁned by V pt,|x|2q :“ vpt, xq for
pt, xq P R1`d, then BtV p0, 0q is a negative multiple of p1, 0q, while both compo-
nents of both BttV p0, 0q and ByV p0, 0q are negative (where y denotes the second
variable of V ).
(v) There exist constants C, c ą 0 such that whenever pt, yq P R ˆ r0,`8q is such
that |V pt, yq ´ V p0, 0q| ď c, we have the bounds

V1p0, 0q ´ Cp|t| ` |y|q ď V1pt, yq ď V1p0, 0q ´ cp|t| ` yq
V2p0, 0q ´ Cp|t|2 ` yq ď V2pt, yq ď V2p0, 0q ´ cp|t|2 ` yq

and
(3.5)
for the components V1pt, yq, V2pt, yq of V pt, yq. (In particular, this implies that
V pt, yq ‰ V p0, 0q whenever pt, yq ‰ p0, 0q.)
(vi) V is supported in the region tpt, yq : y “ pt` Op1qq2u, and one has the dispersive

bounds
(3.6)
for all pt, yq P Rˆr0,`8q and j, k ě 0, where we allow the implied constants to

Proof. We set the ﬁrst component v1 of v to be the function from Proposition 3.1.
For the second component v2, we ﬁrst choose w : Rd Ñ R to be a smooth spherically
symmetric function supported on tx P Rd : |x| ď εu (where ε is the quantity from
Proposition 3.1(i)), with the property that the Fourier transform

ş
is non-negative, and is not identically zero; in particular wp0q “ 1p2πqd
Rd ˆwpξq dξ is
strictly positive. Such a w can be constructed by taking an arbitrary non-zero smooth
spherically symmetric real function and convolving it with itself. We then let v2 : R1`d Ñ
R be the solution to the free wave equation with initial position w and initial velocity
0; more explicitly, we have

which, when combined with Proposition 3.1(ii), implies that BtV p0, 0q is a negative
multiple of p1, 0q, and ByV p0, 0q and BttV p0, 0q have both components negative, giving
(iv).

From the triangle inequality we see that

|v2pt, xq| ď 1

Rd

ˆwpξq dξ “ v2p0, 0q “ wp0q ą 0

for all pt, xq, with strict inequality for pt, xq ‰ p0, 0q (because ˆw cannot be supported
on the measure zero set tξ : cospx ¨ ξq cospt|ξ|q “ ˘1u. Since v2pt, xq decays to zero
as pt, xq Ñ 8, we conclude from a compactness argument that for any δ ą 0, there
exists c ą 0 such that |pt, xq| ď δ whenever |v2pt, xq ´ v2p0, 0q| ď c. In particular, after
adjusting δ and c appropriately, we have |pt, yq| ď δ whenever |V pt, yq ´ V p0, 0q| ď c.
On the other hand, for |pt, yq| ď δ, we then see from two-dimensional Taylor expansion
with remainder that

V1pt, yq “ V1p0, 0q ` pBtV1qp0, 0qt ` pByV1qp0, 0qy ` Opδp|t| ` yqq

pBttV2qp0, 0q ` pByV2qp0, 0qy ` Opδp|t|2 ` yqq

and the claims (3.4), (3.5) then follow (for δ small enough) from (iv).
We have v2p0, 0q “ wp0q ą 0, and from Proposition 3.1(i) we have v1p0, 0q ą 0, giving
the ﬁrst part of (iii). Now we turn to the second part. From the strong Huygens
principle (see e.g. [8, §1.1]); compare also with the explicit formula (3.1)) we see that

BLOWUP FOR HIGH DIMENSIONAL NLW

13

v2 is non-vanishing only when t ´ ε ď r ď t ` ε, but from Proposition 3.1(i) we know
that v1 is positive in this region. This gives the second part of (iii).

Finally, we show (vi). Using standard dispersive estimates for the free wave equation
(see e.g. [8, Theorem 1.1]), we see that

4. Constructing the solution

We are now ready to construct the solution u for Theorem 1.1. As discussed in the
previous section, we may assume that d “ 11 and m “ 2. Let v : R1`11 Ñ R2 be the
solution to the free wave equation constructed by (3.2), with the associated function
V : R ˆ r0,`8q Ñ R2. Henceforth all constants are allowed to depend on v.
Let δ ą 0 be a small quantity to be chosen later, and then let N0 ą 1 be a suﬃciently
large quantity (depending on δ) to be chosen later. We then form the inﬁnite sequence

ones predicted by the numerology (1.3), (1.2) discussed in the introduction.

of the shaded region plus an interval protruding to the left of the origin

strictly positive). The two key features to note here are the “corner” of
the image at vp0, 0q “ V p0, 0q, with the image being locally contained
purely in the lower left quadrant of V p0, 0q; and the more global feature
that the image completely avoids the lower left quadrant of the origin

Let J be the largest natural number for which UJpt1, y1q is non-zero; this quantity is

If J ă i, then Uipt1, y1q “ 0 and the claim (4.22) is immediate from (4.21). Now

Thus pt, yq,pt1, y1q both lie in Ri,C for some ﬁxed C. But by part (i), this forces pt, yq “
pt1, y1q, a contradiction. This concludes the proof of (ii).
(cid:3)

We are now ready to conclude the proof of Theorem 1.1. We deﬁne the function f : R2 Ñ
R2 by setting
whenever pt, yq P Ri for some i, with f vanishing outside of
(i) and (ii) of Proposition 4.1 we see that f is well-deﬁned and smooth, and from (4.4),
(4.7) we see that u and f obey the equation (1.1). The only remaining task is to show
that f and all of its derivatives are bounded. By (4.24) it suﬃces to show that the
composition map F ˝ U´1F : UpRiq Ñ R2 has all derivatives bounded uniformly in i,

i“1 UpRiq. From parts

using Proposition 4.1(i) to construct an inverse map U´1 : UpRiq Ñ Ri. (Note that we
can allow the bound to depend on δ and on the number of derivatives used.)

It is convenient to work on the renormalised rectangle

pointwise estimates
on ˜Up ˜Riq for all j ě 0. From (4.9) and the chain rule we have

R2p ˜F ˝ ˜U´1q| Àδ,j 1

the chain and product rules, we obtain (4.25) as desired. This completes the proof of
Theorem 1.1.

Appendix A. Global regularity in low dimension

In this appendix we show global regularity for the equation (1.1) in dimensions d ď 9.
Actually, to simplify the exposition we shall only handle the most diﬃcult case d “ 9;
dimensions lower than 9 can be handled by a suitable modiﬁcation of the numerology
below, or else by adding some dummy spatial variables to extend the solution u (and the
initial data u0, u1), and then using ﬁnite speed of propagation to smoothly truncate the
solution to again be compactly supported in space; we leave the details to the interested
reader.

Fix m, f . Assume for sake of contradiction that global regularity failed, then there exists
0 ă T˚ ă 8 and a smooth solution u : r0, T˚q ˆ R9 Ñ Rm to (1.1) which is compactly
supported in space, but which does not lie in L8

It remains to prove the theorem. To simplify the notation we omit the domains R9

2 ď p ă 8 be an exponent depending continuously on s to be chosen later. Let ε ą 0
be a small quantity depending continuously on s, p to be chosen later, and then J be
a large integer depending on s, p, ε to be chosen later. For any N ě 1, we let PN be a
smooth Fourier projection of Littlewood-Paley4 type to tξ : N ď 1`|ξ| ď 4Nu, in such
N PN is the identity when N ranges over powers of two. We now use
a fashion that
X À Y , Y Á X, or X “ OpY q to denote a bound of the form |X| ď CY where C can
depend on s, p, ε, J, m, f, T˚, u0, u1, u but does not depend on additional variables such
as N . Applying PN to the hypothesis Ppsq, we conclude in particular that

There are two cases, depending on whether k is large or small. First suppose that k is

which gives (A.12) for J large enough depending on ε, p, since k is bounded by p{2.
Now suppose that k ą p{2. Then we may bound

We thus obtain (A.13) as long as p ą s{2, and ε is small enough.
In summary, we have concluded the desired bound Pps1q as long as we can ﬁnd 2 ď p ă
8 such that cppq ą 1´ s and p ą 2s. By the continuity of c, this condition is equivalent
to the requirement that

cp2sq ą 1 ´ s.

But this can be veriﬁed from (A.6) for all 1 ď s ď 7{2 by a routine calculation (see also
Figure 3.

Remark A.2. If one were working in 10 dimensions instead of 9, then the relevant
range of s is now 1 ď s ď 4, and the analogue of the function c is now given by

cppq :“ minp 11

The requirement cp2sq ą 1 ´ s then fails in the range 2 ď s ď 3, creating a gap in the
iterative argument; see Figure 4. To close this gap in ten dimensions, it appears that
one needs to go beyond the classical Strichartz estimates; for instance, the Strichartz
estimates in amalgam spaces [9] may be of use, although it is not clear to the author if
they are able to bridge the gap completely.
