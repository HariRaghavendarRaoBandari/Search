ABSTRACT

Globular Clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way are the primary laboratories for establishing the ages of the oldest stellar populations
and for measuring the color-magnitude relation of stars. In infrared (IR) color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), the stellar main
sequence (MS) exhibits a “kink”, due to opacity effects in M dwarfs, such that lower mass and cooler dwarfs become bluer
in the IR color baseline. This diagnostic offers a new opportunity to model GC CMDs and to reduce uncertainties on cluster
properties (e.g., their derived ages). In this context, we analyzed Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 IR archival
observations of four GCs – 47 Tuc, M 4, NGC 2808, and NGC 6752 – for which the data are deep enough to fully sample the
low-mass MS, reaching at least ≃ 2 mag below the “kink”. We derived the ﬁducial lines for each cluster and compared them
with a grid of isochrones over a large range of parameter space, allowing age, metallicity, distance, and reddening to vary within
reasonable selected ranges. The derived ages for the four clusters are respectively 11.6, 11.5, 11.2, and 12.1 Gyr and their random
uncertainties are σ ∼ 0.7 – 1.1 Gyr. Our results suggest that the near-IR MS “kink”, combined with the MS turn-off, provides a
valuable tool to measure GC ages and offers a promising opportunity to push the absolute age of GCs to sub-Gyr accuracy with
the next generation IR telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope.

1. INTRODUCTION

Globular Clusters (GCs) are among the oldest objects
in the Universe and accompany most major star formation
episodes in galaxies (e.g. Brodie & Strader 2006). The ab-
solute age determination of the population represents one of
the most reliable measures of when baryonic structure for-
mation occurred in the Universe (Spergel et al. 2003) and
provides robust constraints on the physics adopted in stel-
lar evolutionary models (Salaris & Weiss 1998; Cassisi et al.
1999; VandenBerg et al. 2008; Dotter et al. 2008). The rel-
ative age difference between clusters associated with distinct
structural components establishes the formation and assembly
timescales of these parent populations (e.g., the bulge, halo,
and substructure).

Modern derivations of star cluster ages have primarily in-
volved reproducing visible-light color-magnitude diagrams
(CMDs) with stellar evolutionary models. However, estimates
of absolute GC ages are hampered by uncertainties in other
fundamental parameters: in addition to accounting for sys-
tematic uncertainties due to different assumptions in stellar
models (σ = 0.4 Gyr – Chaboyer & Krauss 2002; Valle et al.
2013a,b) and the cluster metallicity (σ = 0.5 Gyr for a 0.2 dex
error – Dotter et al. 2008), the largest uncertainty impacting
this technique comes from simultaneously “ﬁtting” the age at
a given distance and reddening (σ = 1.5 – 2 Gyr – Chaboyer
2008). On visible CMDs, the latter quantities are estimated
by aligning the luminosity of the horizontal branch and the
slope of the unevolved main sequence (MS) to the observa-
tions (e.g., Iben & Renzini 1984).

Different methods have been proposed to overcome some
the use of a different clock (white

the MS in a pure IR
CMD exhibits a “kink” (hereafter we refer to it simply
as kink) at ∼ 0.5 M⊙,
turns towards bluer colors
(Pulone et al. 1998, 1999; Zoccali et al. 2000; Calamida et al.
2009; Sarajedini et al. 2009; Kalirai et al. 2012; Milone et al.
2012, 2014; Monelli et al. 2015). This feature arises from
a redistribution of the emerging stellar ﬂux due to a change
in opacity caused by the collision-induced absorption of H2
(Linsky 1969; Saumon et al. 1994, and references therein).
The theoretical predictions of temperature and luminosity of
the kink are minimally affected by uncertainties in the treat-
ment of convection (i.e., by mixing length theory calibration),
as the convective motions are nearly adiabatic at these masses
(Saumon & Marley 2008). The luminosity of the kink and
the shape of the bending are dependent on metallicity, but
are independent of age beyond ∼ 1 Gyr. Therefore, the de-
generacy between these two parameters can be partially bro-
ken. Equally as important, the shape of the color-magnitude
relation in the IR CMD, in particular its inversion at mag-
nitude fainter than the kink, provides a new opportunity to si-
multaneously constrain the distance and reddening accurately.
Therefore, this new diagnostic provides a large lever arm to
decrease the uncertainties involved in deriving GC age esti-
mates.

To test the power of this feature to establish accurate GC
properties, we searched the MAST STScI-archive for public
Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) IR data sampling a set of Milky
Way GCs. There are a dozen clusters for which such data
are available, but, only for four GCs, namely 47 Tuc, M 4,
NGC 2808, and NGC 6752, the data are deep enough to reach
≃ 2 mag below the kink. This depth is required to fully sample
the bending of the MS at low masses. The four GCs provide
a good sample to test the predictive power of the MS kink

thoroughly, as they span a signiﬁcative range of metallicity
([Fe/H] ≃ -0.7 – -1.5 dex), distance (d⊙ ≃ 2.1 – 9.6 kpc) and
reddening (E (B-V) ≃ 0.04 – 0.39 dex).

Using an ad-hoc ﬁtting method, we derived a ﬁducial line in
the CMD for each GC. These ﬁducial lines represent the loci
where we expect the single stars (i.e., excluding binaries and
higher multiples) of the cluster to lie if they were observed
without errors. We compared these ﬁducials with a grid of
isochrones and derived the joint posterior probability density
function (PDF) for the four parameters, age, metallicity, dis-
tance and reddening. This, in turn, allowed us to estimate the
best ﬁtting parameters, quantify the correlations among them
and derive the uncertainties of the individual parameters. In
this paper, we focus on the derived GC ages, by marginalizing
the joint PDF over the remaining three parameters.

Our analysis demonstrates the importance of the near-IR
MS kink as an age diagnostic, and illustrates how this feature
can provide the ﬁrst opportunity to push the absolute ages of
GCs to sub-Gyr precision.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: we
present the data set and reduction in Section 2 and the CMDs
of the four GCs in Section 3. We also describe the method
adopted to measure the ﬁducial lines for each of the GCs. In
Section 4 we derive the best-ﬁt isochrones and the probabil-
ity distribution functions, thereby obtaining an estimate of the
age and uncertainty for each GC. In Section 5 we discuss the
results from our study.

2. SAMPLE AND DATA REDUCTION

Our sample consists of four clusters: 47 Tuc (GO-11677,
PI: H. Richer), M 4 (GO-12602, PI: A. Dieball), NGC 2808
(GO-11665, PI: T. M. Brown), and NGC 6752 (GO-11664,
PI: T. M. Brown). With the exception of 47 Tuc, for which
the photometry has been derived in Kalirai et al. (2012), we
downloaded from the MAST STScI-archive the images for
the other three clusters. A description of these datasets is pro-
vided in Table 1.

To reduce the images of M 4, NGC 2808 and NGC 6752
we followed the same method adopted for 47 Tuc, described
in detail in Kalirai et al. (2012). Brieﬂy, we started from
the ﬂt ﬁles provided by the HST pipeline, which consti-
tute the bias-corrected, dark-subtracted and ﬂat-ﬁelded im-
ages. We generated distortion-free images using MultiDriz-
zle (Fruchter & Hook 1997) and we calculated the transfor-
mation between the individual drizzled images in each ﬁlter,
linking them to a reference frame (i.e., the ﬁrst exposure).
Through these transformations we obtain an alignment of the
individual images to better than 0.02 – 0.04 pixels. After ﬂag-

ging and rejecting bad pixels and cosmic rays from the input
images, we created a ﬁnal image for each ﬁlter, combining
the input undistorted and aligned frames. The NGC 2808 and
NGC 6752 ﬁnal images were slightly supersampled to a pixel
scale of 0.′′09 pixel- 1 to mitigate the severe undersampling
of these data. A square kernel was used in the ﬁnal image
generation and the pixfrac was kept near unity. M 4 has a sig-
niﬁcative number of overlapping images, so the ﬁnal images
were supersampled from the native resolution of 0.′′13 pixel- 1
to 0.′′06 pixel- 1, with a Gaussian kernel with pixfrac = 0.70.
The FWHM on this image is ∼ 2.5 pixels.

To perform the stellar photometry in M 4, we used the
stand-alone versions of the DAOPHOT-II and ALLSTAR
point spread function (PSF) ﬁtting programs (Stetson 1987,
1994) on the stacked images. To obtain the ﬁnal catalog we
ﬁrst performed aperture photometry on all the sources that
are at least 3σ above the local sky. We then derived a PSF
from ∼ 1000 bright isolated stars in the ﬁeld, and applied this
PSF to all of the sources detected through the aperture pho-
tometry. We retained in the ﬁnal catalogs only the sources
that were iteratively matched between the two images and we
cleaned them eliminating background galaxies and spurious
detections by means of χ2 and sharpness cuts from the PSF
ﬁtting. For NGC 2808 and NGC 6752, the data were too un-
dersampled to accurately derive a PSF from the frame with
DAOPHOT II. The photometry of all sources was therefore
measured using an aperture with R = 2.5 pixels.

Photometric calibration has been performed using a sample
of bright isolated stars to transform the instrumental magni-
tudes to a ﬁxed aperture of 3 pixels. We then transformed the
magnitudes into the VEGAMAG system by adopting the rel-
evant synthetic zero points for the WFC3/IR ﬁlters. For NGC
2808, the ﬁnal photometric source catalog is built by combin-
ing similar observations in three separate ﬁelds of the cluster.
We corrected each of these ﬁelds for differential reddening
prior to merging.

Fig. 1 shows the F110W - F160W vs F110W CMDs for
the four clusters (from left to right; 47 Tuc, M 4, NGC 2808,
and NGC 6752). The derived CMDs exhibit very well de-
ﬁned sequences, from the sub giant branch to the low-mass
MS well below the kink, which is clearly revealed in all four
GCs. NGC 6752 has the shallowest photometry in our sample,
but we are still able to trace the MS at least ∼ 2 mag below
the kink which allows us to adequately sample its shape and
bending at low masses. With the exception of M 4, all of the

superimposed ﬁducial lines (black lines) that were derived as described in Sect. 3. In contrast to simply deriving the mean color in ﬁxed magnitude bin, the
adopted approach avoids the possibility that the shape of the ﬁducial is altered by the presence of binaries as well as by multiple main sequences, in particular in
the lower part of the MS below the kink.

cluster CMDs also sample the lower portion of the red giant
branch (RGB), which offers additional leverage in simultane-
ously ﬁtting models to different evolutionary stages.

The ﬁrst step to obtain accurate GC parameters is to de-
rive a ﬁducial line for each of the CMDs. For this, we con-
sidered the data in the F160W vs. F110W - F160W CMD.
We used a kernel-density-estimation (KDE) to estimate the 2d
PDF underlying the data. The shape of the PDF derived from
the KDE can be thought of as a mountain range whose ridge
represents the locus of the true underlying cluster isochrone
for single stars, while the width of the range is due mostly
to the measurement errors. Binaries and multiple populations
also play a role in the width. We proceeded by ﬁnding the
PDF global maximum, which becomes the starting point of
the ridge line search. By moving along the direction of mini-
mum gradient, we traced the ridge line. Each move was done
by proposing a set of moves of ﬁxed length within an opening
cone. The move that caused the smallest drop in altitude (i.e.
in PDF value) was the selected one. The length of the chosen
step is related to the smoothness of the KDE PDF. For more
populous CMDs, the step size can be chosen to be smaller
and the resulting ridge (ﬁducial) line is more detailed. The
walk along the ridge line was performed in two separate iter-
ations. Starting from the same highest peak of the mountain
ridge, one of these was a move towards brighter magnitudes
and the other was a move towards fainter magnitudes. Once
this ridge line was traced, we ensured the smoothness of the
ridge line by computing the corresponding bezier curve and
by using this smooth approximation instead of the previously
found line.

While the direction of minimum gradient traces the under-
lying ridge line of the population, at each step the local di-
rection of maximum gradient represents the direction along
which the data are scattered due to measurement errors. To

estimate the actual values for the ﬁducial lines and their uncer-
tainty, we adopted a bootstrap approach. We drew one thou-
sand samples from each cluster catalog, using the same total
number of stars, and allowing for repetitions. We then con-
structed a ﬁducial for each bootstrap catalog using the method
outlined above. The next step was to divide the ensemble of
one thousand ﬁducial realizations, each with about 200 points,
into 0.05 mag bins in F160W. This bin size was chosen to
ensure that each bin contains >= 500 points, thus minimizing
Poisson noise and avoiding large bulk color changes across
the bin which would otherwise artiﬁcially increase the uncer-
tainty. We took the bin center as the F160W ﬁducial value and
half the bin size as its error. To estimate the ﬁducial values and
their errors for the F110W - F160W color, we took the mean
and the standard deviation over the ensemble of ﬁducials, us-
ing the points that fell within each magnitude bin.

This approach offers two main advantages when compared
to simply deriving the mean color in ﬁxed magnitude bins.
First, by starting from the mode of the distribution, and by
moving along the most prominent range, this approach is not
prone to biases due to the presence of binaries which form
a mountain range that runs parallel to the main one. It also
avoids the possibility that the ﬁducial shape is altered by the
presence of multiple main sequences and ensures that the
most prominent one is identiﬁed. This is particularly impor-
tant in the lower part of the MS below the kink, where the sep-
aration between the different main sequences is more evident
in the IR CMDs. In fact, as Milone et al. (2012, 2014) demon-
strated, in NGC 2808 and M 4 the MS is clearly separated in
two components below the kink, due to the different chemical
composition of the two sub-populations. Milone et al. (2012,
2014) suggest that the bluer MS represents a ﬁrst stellar gen-
eration, having primordial helium and high oxygen, while the
redder MS is associated with a second generation consisting

4

of stars enhanced in helium, nitrogen, sodium and depleted in
oxygen.

Figure 2. Left panel: zoom-in of NGC 2808 CMD in the region below the
kink where the MS split is more evident. The ﬁducial line, derived as de-
scribed in Sect. 3, is superimposed as a red curve. Right panel: color distri-
bution of stars in the four magnitude intervals indicated by the dashed lines
in the left panel. The mean ﬁducial color (red line) and its mean error (light
red region) in each speciﬁc bin is also shown.

To verify that our method is able to accurately trace the
most prominent population and to demonstrate its strength,
we followed the same approach adopted by Milone et al.
(2012) to identify the MS splitting below the kink. The left
panel of Fig. 2 shows a zoom-in of the NGC 2808 CMD be-
low the kink, where the MS split is more evident. The de-
rived ﬁducial line is superimposed in red. The color distribu-
tion of stars in the four magnitude intervals, over the range
21.05 < F160W < 22.5 mag, are shown in the right panels.
The mean ﬁducial color (red line) and its mean error (light
red region) in the speciﬁc bin is also shown. The distribu-
tion is clearly bimodal, with an overall shape similar to the
one found by Milone et al. (2012). The different number of
stars in each bin is caused by different choices in the selec-
tion of the sample, and the mean color of the ﬁducial line is
almost coincident with the peak of the distribution in each
bin. Hence, Fig. 2 conﬁrms that the adopted method success-
fully traces the most prominent population of the cluster when
more than one main sequence is present.

To derive the “genuine” GC parameters, it is important to
trace the primordial “ﬁrst generation” population that has the
original cluster chemical abundance. In NGC 2808, the ﬁrst
stellar generation is also the most populated one, but this is not
the case in M 4. As pointed out by Milone et al. (2014) and
shown in the right panel of Fig. 3, the blue sequence in M 4
is less populated than the red one. Hence, for this cluster, our
method does not properly derive the ﬁducial line of the clus-
ter below the kink. To overcome this issue, we adopted the
following empirical approach: we applied a magnitude-color
cut in the CMD to select the stars fainter than F160W ∼ 17
mag where the split between the two sequences begins. The

Figure 3. Same as Fig. 2 but for the cluster M 4. In the case of M 4, the
primordial population is not the most populous one, therefore we have mod-
iﬁed the ﬁducial line computation mechanism to follow the secondary ridge
of the density distribution and not the primary, as shown in the right panel
(see text for details). The dotted histograms represent the color distribution
of stars in the three magnitude intervals after applying the magnitude-color
cut described in Sect. 3.

cut is made to select stars that are redder than the quantity
(F110W - F160W) f iducial +σ, where (F110W - F160W) f iducial
is the color of the ﬁducial line that traces the most prominent
population and σ is its error. We then removed these objects
from the M 4 catalog and re-derived the ﬁducial line and its
error on the new dataset. We iterated this procedure by apply-
ing different magnitude cuts through a ±0.25 mag step with
respect to the default quoted above, and veriﬁed that the de-
rived ﬁducial lines are consistent with each other within the
errors and that the shape is not altered by the different selec-
tion choices. The resulting color histograms (dotted line) for
each magnitude bin are reported in the right panel of Fig. 3,
together with the mean ﬁducial color (red line) and its mean
error (light red region). With the exception of the central mag-
nitude interval, for which the mean color of the ﬁducial is still
too red compared to the color of the blue peak of the ﬁrst
stellar generation, the newly derived ﬁducial line reproduces
quite well the observed distribution. However, as we will see
in Sect. 4.2, this small discrepancy does not affect the global
ﬁtting and the resulting best-ﬁt parameters for M 4. Due to
the different procedure applied for this cluster and the low
number of stars below the kink, the uncertainties derived in
Sect. 4.3 could be slightly underestimated.

Tracing the primordial MS below the kink is an important
factor in deriving the correct cluster metallicity and therefore
a precise age estimate. In fact, the degree of the MS bending
is strictly related to the cluster metallicity, due to the differ-
ent opacities in stars. The net effect is that more metal-rich
clusters will exhibit a MS bending that is more accentuated
bluewards. This effect is clearly visible in the ﬁducial lines
shown in Fig. 1; as expected, the more metal-rich GC of our
sample (i.e., 47 Tuc, [Fe/H] ≃ -0.75 dex, left panel of Fig. 1)
exhibits a ﬁducial line which is clearly more tilted bluewards

than the others. Moving towards lower metallicity (from the
left to the right CMDs in Fig. 1), the ﬁducial lines bending
shifts progressively redwards, until in the most metal-poor GC
of our sample (i.e., NGC 6752, [Fe/H] ≃ -1.5 dex, right panel
of Fig. 1) there is essentially no bending and the sequence is
vertical.

4. CONSTRAINTS ON THE GC PARAMETERS

4.1. Isochrone ﬁtting: deriving ages

To derive the age, metallicity, distance and reddening
for the four GCs, we compared the ﬁducial lines (obtained
as described in Sect. 3) with a set of stellar models from
the Victoria-Regina stellar evolution code (VandenBerg et al.
2014). The models were transformed to the WFC3/IR ﬁl-
ter system by performing synthetic photometry using the
MARCS library of stellar spectra (Gustafsson et al. 2008) and
the most updated WFC3/IR throughputs and zero points. Ex-
tinction was taken into account by applying the Fitzpatrick
(1999) extinction law to the spectra before integrating them
under the throughput curves, using the appropriate RV value
for each cluster.

We constructed a grid of isochrones over a large range of
parameter space that allowed age, metallicity, distance and
reddening to vary over reasonable ranges. The reference val-
ues and the adopted intervals are reported in Table 2. We use a
ﬁxed age range from 9 to 15 Gyr for all GCs, whereas for the
metallicity, we used an interval of ± 0.20 dex with respect to
literature values derived from spectroscopic studies for each
cluster. For the distance modulus, we adopted an interval of
± 0.25 mag. For the reddening, we used E (B - V ) = 0 as a
lower limit and E (B- V)re f + 0.15 mag as an upper limit (with
the exception of M 4, for which we adopted an interval of ±
0.15 mag from the reference value). When necessary, we it-
eratively readjusted the parameter range in order to center the
derived best-ﬁt results in the new interval. The derived grid is
obtained by adopting steps of 0.1 Gyr for the age, 0.01 dex for
the metallicity and 0.01 mag for distance and reddening. We
assume that, within the allowed ranges, the prior probability
distribution of the parameters is uniform.

In our analysis, the only a priori ﬁxed parameters are the
[α/Fe] ratio, the extinction coefﬁcient RV and the helium
abundance. For the [α/Fe] ratio we adopted the value [α/Fe]
= +0.4, as suggested from spectroscopic studies of these clus-
ters. For the extinction coefﬁcient, RV , we adopted the value
RV = 3.1 for all GCs except for M 4, for which we adopted a
higher value of RV = 3.6 (Hendricks et al. 2012). The origi-
nal helium abundance in the stellar models was obtained us-
ing Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 from Gennaro et al. (2010), after the ra-
tio between [Fe/H] and [M/H] was taken into account using
Eq. 3 from Salaris et al. (1993). We assumed the solar mixture
from Asplund et al. (2009), a primordial helium abundance

of YP = 0.2485 from Izotov et al. (2007) and Peimbert et al.
(2007), and a ratio of ∆Y /∆Z = 1.5.

To obtain the best-ﬁt isochrone for each cluster, we com-
pared the ﬁducial lines with the isochrone grid, deriving for
each isochrone the posterior PDF which, due to the choice of
uniform priors for our parameters, is proportional to the likeli-
hood L. The latter is calculated using the following equation:

L ≃ exp(- 1
2

σ is the error associated with the ﬁducial color points, derived
as described in Sect. 3. The best-ﬁt isochrone is the one that
maximizes the joint PDF for the four parameters.

Fig. 4 shows the GC CMDs (ordered as in Fig. 1) with
superimposed ﬁducial lines (black lines) and the best-ﬁt
isochrones (red lines). The derived parameters and uncer-
tainties from the best-ﬁt isochrone for each cluster (i.e., age,
metallicity, distance modulus, and reddening – as described in
Sect. 4.3) are reported in Table 3. The best-ﬁt isochrones re-
produce almost perfectly the ﬁducial lines along all of the se-
quences in the CMDs. To better visualize the goodness of the
ﬁt, we illustrate the ﬁt residuals (i.e., the term ∆col in Eq. 2)
in Fig. 5 as a function of the magnitude F110W for the four
GCs (47 Tuc, top left panel, M 4, top right panel, NGC 2808,
bottom left panel, and NGC 6752, bottom right panel). The
1σ and 2σ errors (dark and light gray area in Fig. 5), where
σ is the ﬁducial color error as deﬁned above, are also pre-
sented in Fig. 5. Small discrepancies between the ﬁducial line
and the best-ﬁt isochrone, of the order of few hundredths of a
magnitude, are observed in the sub giant branch and red giant
branch of 47 Tuc and in the red giant branch of NGC 6752.
However, in the latter case, we note that due to the paucity
of stars populating this region of the CMD, the ﬁducial line
colors can not be determined with high precision. For M 4,
we derived the best-ﬁt parameters using also the other two
ﬁducial lines obtained with the different magnitude cuts, as
described in Sect. 3. We obtained variations of just ± 0.2 Gyr
for the age, ± 0.02 dex for the metallicity, ± 0.01 mag for
the distance modulus, and ± 0.01 mag for the reddening, with
respect to the value reported in Table 3.

To verify that the isochrone ﬁtting provides reasonable
values for the best-ﬁt parameters, we compared our results
with literature estimates of these four GCs. The most direct
comparison is with the results obtained by VandenBerg et al.
(2014), but, unfortunately, there is only one cluster in com-
mon between the two studies, namely 47 Tuc. Hence, we fo-
cus on the results obtained by VandenBerg et al. (2013), who
derived the same parameters from the analysis of HST Ad-
vanced Camera for Survey (ACS) visible light photometry.
This analysis used the same stellar evolutionary code that we
use, although slightly different prescriptions for the isochrone
computation. Brieﬂy, the main difference between the two
sets of models concerns the assumed metal mixture, that is
VandenBerg et al. (2014) models assume a signiﬁcantly lower
abundance of the CNO elements (see for a detailed description
of the models and their differences, VandenBerg et al. 2013,
2014). This, in turn, implies that slightly higher ages will be
obtained using VandenBerg et al. (2014) models, with respect
to those derived by VandenBerg et al. (2013), due to the fact

that turn-off luminosity versus age relations depend on the ab-
solute abundance of oxygen (see for an exhaustive discussion,
VandenBerg et al. 2012).
In this context, VandenBerg et al.
(2014) speciﬁed that to partially compensate for the expected
effects of the different oxygen and metal abundances between
the models, they assumed slightly larger distance moduli (≤
0.05 mag) and ages (by 0.25 Gyr) with respect to the values
derived by VandenBerg et al. (2013). We can then assume that
a similar variation, of the order of 0.25 – 0.75 Gyr (depend-
ing on the assumed apparent distance modulus), can be ex-
pected also for the clusters in this work that were not analyzed
in VandenBerg et al. (2014); therefore, the ages reported in
VandenBerg et al. (2013) should be increased by these quanti-
ties in order to obtain ages based on VandenBerg et al. (2014)
isochrones. We note that, also taking into account these vari-
ations, our age estimates are in agreement within the errors
with those derived by VandenBerg et al. (2013). In the fol-
lowing, to not generate confusion to the readers, we will re-
port the original values derived by VandenBerg et al. (2013),

with the exception of 47 Tuc for which we report the values
derived in VandenBerg et al. (2014).

We brieﬂy summarize these comparisons.
47 Tuc:

the best-ﬁt parameters for this cluster are in
good agreement within the errors with the values derived by
VandenBerg et al. (2014). They derived an age of 12.0 Gyr
and an apparent distance modulus (m - M)V = 13.40 mag, as-
suming a metallicity [Fe/H] = - 0.76 dex and reddening E(B-
V) = 0.028 mag4. Our best-ﬁt parameters are also in good
agreement with the Harris (2006) database; [Fe/H] = - 0.72
dex, (m - M)V = 13.37 mag and E(B-V) = 0.04 mag.

M 4: the derived values for M 4 are in good agreement with
the values derived by VandenBerg et al. (2013), with the ex-
ception of the metallicity.
Within the uncertainty, we derive the same age (11.5 Gyr)
and apparent distance modulus ((m - M)V = 12.72 mag vs
(m - M)V = 12.74 mag) as VandenBerg et al. (2013), but the
metallicity is slightly different ([Fe/H] = -1.09 dex vs [Fe/H] =
- 1.18 dex). However, the metallicity estimates of M 4 derived
from high-resolution spectroscopy cover this range; for exam-
ple, [Fe/H] ≃ - 1.07 dex (Marino et al. 2008; Villanova et al.
2012; Malavolta et al. 2013) to [Fe/H] ≃ - 1.18 (Ivans et al.
1999; Carretta et al. 2009a). As shown in Table 2, we adopted
[Fe/H] = - 1.12 dex (Marino et al. 2011) as a reference value.
The M 4 dataset in our study is optimized to achieve high-
precision photometry for faint M-dwarfs. As a result, we were
not able to sample the RGB and could not achieve a stronger
constraint on the cluster metallicity from CMD ﬁtting. Still,
the derived metallicity is in good agreement with the litera-
ture values, suggesting that the luminosity of the kink and the
bending of the low-mass MS could provide a new diagnostic
for this parameter. Distance determination also agrees quite
well with the recent estimates based on RR Lyraes ((m- M)0 =
11.27 – 11.39 mag, Neeley et al. 2015; Braga et al. 2015, see
their Table 1 for a detailed summary of the distance and red-

4 VandenBerg et al. (2013) and VandenBerg et al. (2014) adopted [Fe/H]
values from Carretta et al. (2009b) and E(B-V) values, with few exceptions,
from Schlegel et al. (1998).

NGC 2808: While the best-ﬁt parameters

dening available in the literature). Taking into account the
derived reddening E(B-V) = 0.38 mag and the adopted RV
= 3.6, we obtain an apparent distance modulus (m - M)V =
12.72 mag. Since < MV > = 13.33 mag for the RR Lyrae
in M 4 (Braga et al. 2015), we obtain a < MV > = 0.61 mag.
Clementini et al. (2003) results for the apparent magnitude of
the Large Magellanic Clouds (LMC) RR Lyrae as a function
of [Fe/H] coupled with the very precise LMC distance found
by Pietrzynksi et al. (2013) yields < MV > = 0.66 ± 0.06 mag
for RR Lyrae that have [Fe/H] values near - 1.1 dex, in agree-
ment within the errors with the < MV > derived in this work.
for age,
metallicity, and reddening are in good agreements with
VandenBerg et al. (2013), the apparent distance modulus does
not agree. Our value is (m - M)V = 15.74 mag, 0.15 mag
larger than the VandenBerg et al. (2013) estimate of (m -
M)V = 15.59 mag (coincident with the value tabulated in
Harris 2006). Using a different stellar model grid (BaSTI,
Pietrinferni et al. 2004, 2006) and a slightly different chem-
ical composition ([α/Fe] = +0.3 dex), Marino et al. (2014)
ﬁtted the cluster using an isochrone with age 10 Gyr, metallic-
ity [Fe/H] = - 1.15 dex, apparent distance modulus (m - M)V
= 15.67 mag, and reddening E(B-V) = 0.19 mag. This lat-
ter value for the distance is in agreement within the errors
with our estimate, although from the distance-age relation
we should expect to obtain a younger age given our larger
distance estimate. As another example, Dalessandro et al.
(2011), used high-resolution far-UV and optical images of
the central region of the cluster from HST/WFPC2 to ana-
lyze the horizontal branch of the cluster. Using the same set
of isochrones as in Marino et al. (2014), they derived an age
of 12 Gyr, a metallicity [Fe/H] = - 1.31 dex, and an [α/Fe]
= +0.4 dex. They measured an apparent distance modulus
(m - M)V = 15.74 mag, the same as that derived in our study.
NGC 6752: best-ﬁt parameters are in agreement within the
uncertainties with the results obtained by VandenBerg et al.
(2013), who derived an age of 12.5 Gyr and apparent distance
modulus (m- M)V = 13.24 mag, assuming a metallicity [Fe/H]

4.3. Posterior probability density function:

deriving age uncertainties

As we stated in Sect. 1, the main advantage of using the MS
kink in IR CMDs as an age diagnostic is that this feature can
provide a fundamental tool to reduce the uncertainties asso-
ciated with GC age estimates. The location of the kink and
the shape of the bending of the low-mass MS are dependent
on metallicity, but are independent of age, allowing a partial
break of the degeneracy between these two parameters. Due
to the particular shape of the color-magnitude relation below
the kink, the uncertainties related to the distance and redden-
ing are also reduced.

To test the validity of this hypothesis and accurately de-
rive the age uncertainties for each cluster, we adopted the
following approach. For each isochrone of the grid, we de-
rived the joint posterior PDF, which, as stated in Sect. 4.2,
due to the choice of uniform priors for our parameters, is
proportional to the likelihood L. The latter is derived from
Eq. 1 and Eq. 2. We then derived the 1d posterior PDF
for the age, obtained by the marginalization of the 4d PDF
(i.e., P(age,metallicity,reddening,distance)) over metallic-
ity, distance and reddening. The 1d posterior PDFs for the
four GCs are shown in Fig. 6 (47 Tuc, black line, M 4, red
line, NGC 2808, blue line, and NGC 6752, green line, respec-
tively). The age uncertainties are derived from the cumulative

distribution of the marginalized age distribution; 1σ (2σ) con-
ﬁdence intervals are deﬁned as the area enclosed within 16%
(2.5%) and 84% (97.5%) of each cluster’s cumulative distri-
bution. This would correspond to the true 1σ and 2σ uncer-
tainties if the 1d PDFs were Gaussian. Fig. 6 shows that the
derived random age uncertainties are of the order of σ ∼ 0.7 -
1.1 Gyr. As stated in Sect. 3 and considering the uncertainties
in the best-ﬁt parameters for M 4 when a different magnitude
cut is applied, we acknowledge that the derived uncertainty
for the age of this cluster, σ = 0.5 Gyr, could be underesti-
mated. Taking into account the age range derived in Sect. 4.2,
and considering a systematic uncertainty of the order of ± 0.3
Gyr, we estimate that the value σ ∼ 0.8 Gyr is more represen-
tative of the GC age uncertainty. Similar uncertainties, of the
order of ± 1 Gyr, have been recently derived by Monelli et al.
(2015), which exploited the MS kink as a diagnostic to derive
the absolute age of the old metal-poor GC M 15. Their anal-
ysis is based on near-IR images collected with the PISCES
camera, coupled with the First Light Adaptive Optics system
mounted at the Large Binocular Telescope.

To better visualize how the use of the kink lessens the cor-
relations and interdependencies between the various parame-
ters, we derived the 2d posterior PDFs of all of the param-
eters for each cluster. These 2d PDFs are obtained as de-
scribed above, with the only difference being that the 4d PDF
is marginalized over two parameters instead of three. For
example, the 2d PDF of age and metallicity is obtained by
marginalization of the 4d PDF over distance and reddening.

rior PDFs, Fig. 9 NGC 2808 2d posterior PDFs, and Fig. 10
NGC 6752 2d PDFs. In particular, the distance vs reddening
2d PDFs (bottom right panel in each Figure) shows that the
morphology of the color-magnitude relation in the low mass-
MS leads to a decrease in the uncertainties on distance and
reddening, and consequently on the GC ages.

These uncertainties can be considered to be an upper limit
as they are obtained adopting a conservative approach that
assumes a priori uniform distributions over the allowed pa-
rameter ranges. If we adopted stronger constraints from in-
dependent measures of these parameters, the derived age un-
certainty would be lower. Finally, we note that the quoted
uncertainties only take into account random noise (number
statistics and measurement errors). We acknowledge that the
total uncertainty on GC parameters is further increased by the
presence of a systematic component due to e.g.
the choice
of the stellar evolution library, stellar atmospheres and possi-
ble zero-point offsets (as well as other, more subtle, possibly
unknown sources of uncertainty).

The results from this project suggest that using IR photom-
etry and the kink as an age diagnostic can push the absolute
ages of GCs to sub-Gyr accuracy with the next generation
near-IR telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST), the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST),

and large ground-based telescopes with advanced adaptive op-
tics technology.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we investigated the predictive power and the
constraints established on GC properties by leveraging the
shape of the MS color-magnitude relation in pure IR CMDs.
The IR color-magnitude relation exhibits a kink due to opac-
ity effects in M dwarfs, such that low mass MS stars become
bluer in the IR color baseline and not redder. The combina-
tion of the MS turn-off location with that of the MS kink, and
the shape of the bending below the kink, decreases the ef-
fects of the correlations and interdependencies between vari-
ous parameters (i.e., age, metallicity, distance and reddening).
Therefore, this diagnostic offers a new opportunity to improve
the accuracy of GC age measurements over visible-light stud-
ies.

We analyzed publicly available MAST data for four GCs,
namely 47 Tuc, M 4, NGC 2808, and NGC 6752, for which
existing data are deep enough to reach ≃ 2 mag below the
kink. With this photometry, we can fully sample the bending
of the MS at low masses.

By using an ad-hoc ﬁtting method, we derived ﬁducial
lines for the four GCs. We compared them with a grid of

10

Correnti et al.

Figure 8. Same as Fig. 7, for the GC M 4

isochrones over a large range of parameter space that allows
age, metallicity, distance, and reddening to vary within rea-
sonably selected ranges. We calculated the joint posterior
PDF for the four parameters, and derived best ﬁt isochrones
by maximizing the PDF. We obtained an age of 11.6 Gyr for
47 Tuc, 11.5 Gyr for M 4, 11.2 Gyr for NGC 2808, and 12.1
Gyr for NGC 6752. These best-ﬁt ages, and the other de-
rived parameters, agree quite well with the results obtained
by VandenBerg et al. (2013), who used the same stellar evo-
lution code to analyze visible-light ACS photometry of these
GCs.

To derive the age uncertainty in each GC, we calculated the
1d posterior PDF, obtained by marginalizing the 4d posterior
PDF over metallicity, distance and reddening. We calculated
the 1σ and 2σ conﬁdence intervals from the cumulative distri-
bution of the marginalized 1d PDF, where 1(2)σ is deﬁned as
the area enclosed within the 16% (2.5%) and 84% (97.5%)
of the cumulative distribution. The random age uncertain-
ties are σ ∼ 0.7 – 1.1 Gyr. Our results suggest that the IR
color-magnitude relation and kink in the lower MS represents
a promising tool to obtain absolute ages of GCs with sub-Gyr
accuracy.

Deriving sub-Gyr ages for GCs represents a foundation
for many astrophysical topics. A precise age will constrain
the formation epoch of clusters with respect to reionization,
which is crucial for constraining models of cluster formation.

More accurate ages will also lead to a new age-metallicity
relation with absolute uncertainty that is smaller than the cur-
rent scatter. Obtaining sub-Gyr ages for GCs will enable us
to accurately derive the absolute normalization and the slope
of this relation. The latter is an anchor to high-resolution N-
body simulations of galaxy formation, and informs the mass-
merger history that leads to the build up of Milky Way-type
halos (Mackey & Gilmore 2004; Beers et al. 2012, and refer-
ences therein).

Producing an accurate set of ﬁducial lines, spanning a large
range of metallicity, is of fundamental importance both from
the theoretical and observational point of view. These re-
lations can help test stellar models for low mass stars and
represent fundamental templates for the calibration of fu-
ture space observations with the next generation near-IR tele-
scopes, such as JWST, WFIRST, and ground-based 30-meters
telescopes with adaptive optics technology.

We are grateful for a very thoughtful review by the anony-

mous referee, which improved this paper.
