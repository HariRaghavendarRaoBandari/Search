Introduction.— Seeking for novel quantum phases is al-
ways of great
It
is widely thought that exotic quantum phases may appear,
among others, in spin systems with frustration. The kagome
Heisenberg antiferromagnetic (KHAF) model is one of the
most frustrated antiferromagnets, which has therefore at-
tracted extensive attention both theoretically and experimen-
tally, upsurging active debate in recent years. Earlier studies
on the spin-1/2 quantum KHAF can be traced back to more
than twenty years ago [1–3]. Through continuous eﬀorts of
many scientists, its ground state is generally believed to be
a spin liquid without any symmetry breaking [4, 5]. How-
ever, whether or not there is a gap in this interesting system
still remains controversial [5–12]. Meanwhile, the high spin
(S > 1/2) kagome physics has also gained great interest cur-
rently. For the spin-1 KHAF, the ground state was shown to
be a nonmagnetic simplex valence bond crystal with geomet-
ric inversion symmetry breaking [13–18]. In the limit of large
S , the ground state of KHAF was argued to be the
3
state with a long-range magnetic order [19, 20].

In high spin kagome antiferromagnets, the spin-3/2 KHAF
is particularly intriguing.
Intuitively, it should diﬀer from
those of spin-1/2 and spin-1 counterparts, and is also
thought to be with the intermediate between quantum and
classical nature.
Nonetheless, despite a lot of eﬀorts
its nature is
made both experimentally and theoretically,
still ambiguous and controversial up to date.
The ex-
perimental studies on a number of spin-3/2 KHAF mate-
rials such as S rCr8Ga4O19[21], S rCr8Ga4−xMxO19(M =
Zn, Mg, Cu) [22], Ba2S n2ZnGa10−7pCr7pO22 [23], and Cr-
jarosite KCr3(OH)6(S O4)2 [24], etc., have produced diverse
results, leading to diﬀerent even contradictory conclusions on
the nature of the spin-3/2 KHAF. For instance, there are stud-

√

ies showing that it has no antiferromagnetic long-range order
but undergoes a spin-glass transition [21–23], while the oth-
ers reported that it possesses a long-range order with a nearly
120◦ structure [24, 25]. On the theoretical aspect, a direct
study on overall ground-state as well as thermodynamic prop-
erties of the spin-3/2 KHAF is still sparse. The nonlinear spin-
wave theory (NSWT) and real space perturbation theory [26]
gave the phase diagram of spin-S kagome XXZ model, re-
vealing when the anisotropic parameter ∆ increases, there is a
phase transition from q = 0 state [Fig. 1 (b)] to
3
state [Fig. 1(c)], where the critical point ∆c is above 0.7.
The coupled-cluster method [27] showed that for the spin-3/2
kagome XXZ model, the transition from q = 0 to
3
state happens at ∆c = 0.525. The high temperature series
expansion (HTSE) [28] gives that the phase transition point
is slightly lower than 0.8, which is close to the result ob-
tained with the NSWT, but diﬀerent from that obtained by the
coupled-cluster method. In addition, it is still a challenge to
accurately calculate the thermodynamic properties at low tem-
peratures for kagome Heisenberg spin systems. The conven-
tional HTSE method [29] can eﬀectively capture the nature
at high or even intermediate temperatures, but was unable to
reliably determine the thermodynamic behavior at low tem-
perature. In this case, a systematic and accurate study on the
spin-3/2 KHAF is quite indispensable.

renormalization group method with three diﬀerent optimiza-
tion schemes, we determine with high accuracy the ground

entangled pair states (iPEPS, [30]) for a variational study.

position, TSD [31], can be used to get the optimized |ψg(cid:105), i.e.,

ties, we ﬁrst set the Trotter step τ = 0.1 and reduce it gradually
to 10−5. In calculating the thermodynamic properties, we set
τ = 0.01 for convenience, and take the second-order TSD to
further reduce the Trotter error.

Figure 1(a) presents the iPEPS representation of the wave
function, which contains six inequivalent tensors X, Y, Z and
A, B, C. Each of X, Y and Z tensors contains three geometri-
cal indices and three physical indices. A diagonal matrix λi,
i = 1, 2, ...9 (denoted by diamond) resides on each geometri-
cal bond of the TN. When one applies e−τha(b) to the tensor-
network trial wavefunction, the geometric bond dimension
will be increased continually. To truncate the bond, restrict-
ing its dimension as D, the inﬂuence of environment on the
bond should be considered. As the exact environment is gen-
erally not feasible, proper approximation schemes are needed,
which include local optimization (simple update [1] and clus-
ter update [2, 3]) and global optimization (full update [4–9]),
which are all adopted in our calculations (see Supplementary
Information for the technical details).

timization |ψg(cid:105) = limβ→∞ e−βH|ψ0(cid:105), one will have the chance
to get both q = 0 and

fying the reliability of our method. At low temperatures, the

supports that the low-lying excitation is gapless.

Susceptibility.— Figure 5 presents the susceptibility χ ob-
tained with the cluster update scheme (D = 16), it is observed
that χ(T) exhibits an interesting behavior with a dip and a
peak at low temperatures, and obeys a Curie-Weiss law at high
temperatures. The low-temperature peak of χ(T) is the typi-
cal feature of an antiferromagnet, but as T → 0, χ(T) does
not converge to zero but to a ﬁnite constant 0.164, as demon-
strated in the inset of Fig. 5. The nonzero χ(0) may be owing
to the fact that the ground state has a long-range order and the
low-lying excitations are gapless. To verify our calculations,

In Fig. 3, we show the ground state magnetization curve
obtained by cluster update with D = 10, where a magnetiza-
tion plateau at m = ms/3 is present. It is the consequence of
the enlarged magnetic unit cell of
3 state on kagome
lattice, consistent with the topological quantization condition
of n(S − m) = integer with n = 3. We note that a 1/3-
magnetization plateau-like anomaly was experimentally ob-
served at T =1.3 K in S =3/2 perfect kagome lattice antiferro-
magnet KCr3(OH)6(SO4)2 by Okuta et al. [24], compatible
with our calculations. Besides, there is no m = 0 plateau in
the magnetic curve, indicating the existence of a gapless spin
excitation. This is due to the spontaneous continuous symme-
try breaking in the ground state and corresponding massless
Goldstone modes. However, we found that such a
3
ordered state is completely melted at any ﬁnite temperature,
consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem [41]. The ex-
perimental observation of the antiferromagnetic order below
the Ne´el temperature TN =4.5 K in Cr-jarosite by the magnetic
susceptibility measurement by Okuta et al. [24] may be as-
cribed to a three-dimensional eﬀect at low temperatures.

sults of ten-th order HTSE. It can be seen that the speciﬁc heat

ture of the 2D isotropic antiferromagnets. Our results are in

In this Supplementary Information, we describe brieﬂy the algorithmic details with simple[S1], cluster[S2, S3] and full

update[S4–S6] schemes in optimizing the iPEPS wave function of the spin-3/2 KHAF model.

SIMPLE UPDATE

As shown in Fig. S1 (a), we take the tensor X as the “system”, three λ’s around X as the eﬀective “environment”. We ﬁrst

absorb the λ’s into the tensor X:

¯X p1 p2 p3
i1i2i3

=

X p1 p2 p3
j1 j2 j3

λ1
i1 j1 ...λ2

i2 j2 λ3

i3 j3 .

(S1)

Then we perform the imaginary-time evolution. By acting the projection operator e−βha(b) onto ¯X, we get the renewed ¯X. Next,
we decompose the physical index from the tensor ¯X using higher-order singular value decomposition in the way of (taking M1
as an example)

(S3)

The reduced density matrices Ui (i = 1, 2, 3) and the diagonal matrices S i can be obtained by the eigenvalue decomposition.
In this process, we keep D largest diagonal elements of S i and corresponding D columns in Ui to ensure that the computing cost
does not continue to increase, and then update λ’s with these

S matrices.

√

Subsequently, we contract the tensor A with the three transform matrices U’s, as shown in Fig. S1(b). Likewise, the tensors
Y, Z and B, C are also be updated in this way. This process moves the physical indices from tensors X, Y, Z to tensors A, B,
C, which completes the projection substep on the upper triangle. Now we continue to perform similar operations again and
complete the projection of a down triangle, moving the physical indices back to the tensors X, Y, Z. This accomplishes the
projection of a full Trotter slice, while the structure of the iPEPS representation remains intact. We set τ = 0.1 at the beginning
and gradually reduce it to τ = 10−6 until the iPEPS converges.

FIG. S2. (Color online) Graphical representation for the cluster update scheme. (a) The tensor network contains three inequivalent kinds of
hexagons, marked by N1, N2, N3, respectively. Each hexagon contains nine physical indices and six geometrical indices. (b) Take unit cell
N1 as an example. We contract the double-layer tensor cluster to get tensor W, which will later be canonicalized for updating the eﬀective
environment ˜λ9, as well as the tensors X and A. (c) After the “canonicalization”, we contract the hexagon tensor cluster with its conjugate
layer, leaving only ˜λ9 and one physical bond open, and obtain the reduced density matrix M1.

CLUSTER UPDATE

In the simple update scheme, only three λ matrices around a single tensor (A, B, C, X,Y, Z) are considered to approximately
represent the eﬀect of environments. In the cluster update, we choose a hexagon consists of six tensors as a cluster. As show
in Fig. S2 (a), any hexagon of the tensor network contains six adjacent tensors X, Y, Z, A, B, and C. One can see, after some
counting, that there are three kinds of hexagons N1, N2 and N3. Just like in the simple update, we consider the environment
“locally”, while the diﬀerence is that the system is extended from a single tensor X (Y or Z) to a hexagon N1 (N2 or N3). We ﬁrst
make the cluster tensors to satisfy the orthogonal conditions [S7] (taking the cluster tensor N1 for example) and then consider
the six λ’s on the dangling bonds as the “environment” of the hexagon cluster for cutting process in the following:

(S4)

Now we show how to make the cluster tensors N1, N2 and N3 satisfy the orthogonality conditions simultaneously. As shown
in Fig. S2 (b), by taking N1 as an example, we build a double-layer structure of the cluster tensor and connect all geometric
bonds on bra and ket layers except a certain bond (e.g., λ9). Then, we contract the left graph of Fig. S2 (b) to get a matrix W
[as in the middle graph of Fig. S2 (b)]. For a later convenience, we do not absorb the diagonal matrix λ9 into W. Subsequently,
we suppose W and λ9 comprise a one-dimensional chain and perform a 1D canonicalization procedure[S9] to get a renewed ˜λ9
and ˜W, and what we have done to W is actually acting on tensors X and A and we get renewed tensors ˜X and ˜A. In this way,
we complete the regularization on the cluster tensor N1 along the direction of λ9 and obtain the renewed cluster tensor N1 [Fig.
S2(c) left]. We then continue to regularize the cluster tensor N1 in the direction of λ5 and get renewed tensors ˜Y, ˜C and ˜λ5.
Then, we regularize the cluster tensor N1 in the direction of λ1 and renew tensors ˜Z, ˜B and ˜λ1. We iterate this procedure until
the so-obtained renewed N1 simultaneously satisﬁes the orthogonality conditions in all three directions. Similar operations can
apply to the cluster tensors N2 and N3. In the end, such an arbitrary hexagon cluster tensor satisﬁes the orthogonality condition.
Note that we do not invoke any truncation so far, and what we have done is just to regularize cluster tensor N1, N2, N3 into their
“canonical” form.

FIG. S3. (Color online) Graphic representation for the full update scheme. (a) Tensors E1, E2, ··· , E6 are environmental matrices obtained by
the iTEBD algorithm. Tensors X and A are the “system” tensors that need to be transformed and optimized, where tensor X has three physical
indices but tensor A does not. The right panel shows the QR decomposition of tensor X. (b) By cutting the bond between tensors Q and R, and
contracting the whole tensor cluster, one get an environment tensor K, with which one optimizes the decimation matrix variationally.

Next we must move the physical indices from tensors X, Y, Z to A, B, C. This procedure will increase the bond dimensions,
and one needs to truncate them back. We again take the cluster tensor N1 as an example. The six ˜λ’s around N1 can be regarded
as the environment. As shown in Fig. S2 (c), we contract N1 with its conjugate and obtain the reduced density matrix M1. Then
take an eigenvalue decomposition on M1 [see Eq.(S3)], we get the isometry U1 and diagonal matrix S 1. By the same procedure
we get U2, ..., U9, and S 2, ..., S 9. The subsequent steps are in the same way as in the simple update scheme [see Eq. (S3) and the
paragraph under it].

Finally, after we obtain the PEPS representation of the converged ground state wave function, we need to measure the physical
quantity. Here we adopt the inﬁnite time-evolution block decimation (iTEBD) algorithm to contract the two-dimensional inﬁnite
lattice, with dimension of boundary matrix product states (MPS) Dc = 3D, and then measure the physical quantities following
iPEPS algorithm [S8]. In the simulation of spin-3/2 KHAF, we ﬁnd Dc = 3D is suﬃcient to get the convergent and accurate
expectation value, however in the case of spin-3/2 XXZ model, Dc = D2 is practically chosen.

FULL UPDATE

Diﬀerent from the simple and cluster update schemes, full update scheme contracts the whole two-dimensional tensor network
to obtain the global environment, rather than making “local” approximation (in another word, a Bethe lattice approximation
[S2]) of the environment. However, such a procedure increases the computing cost signiﬁcantly. There are two popular ways,
the iTEBD and corner transfer matrix (CTM) methods, which are widely used to contract the environment globally. Here we
adopt the iTEBD method in the full update calculations. We take the bond dimension of MPS as χ = 3D, which is suﬃcient for
the spin-3/2 KHAF. After contracting the environment, we get the tensor structure shown in Fig. S3 (a), where the tensors X and
A comprise the system and the tensors E1 to E6 represent the environment that we obtained by iTEBD contractions. Next, we
do a QR decomposition on tensor X, and separate one physical index [right column in Fig. S3 (a)]. Fig. S3 (b) gives an example
along the direction of tensors X and A, which leads to an increase of the bond dimension to d × D (for a spin-3/2 system, d = 4).
So we need to reduce the bond dimension from d × D to D, to make the update procedure sustainable.
Then we optimize the truncation matrices variationally. By disconnecting the bond between tensors Q and R, as shown in Fig.
S3 (b), and contracting all environment tensors, we get a tensor K, which has four geometrical bonds with dimension of d × D.
The subsequent process for truncating the enlarged bond dimension follows Refs. [S4–S6], and the only diﬀerence is that we
use the bond-based truncation optimization, instead of site-based ones. In the latter case, X and A tensors are to be optimized,
while in the present scheme, we ﬁnd variationally the bond truncation matrix, starting with two identity matrices, to decimate the
enlarged geometric bonds. After the variational optimization, we get a pair of truncation matrices UL and UR between tensors Q
and R. We can then proceed to ﬁnd the truncation matrices along other two directions of tensor X. Likewise, the tensors Y and Z

Kcan be truncated in a similar way. When nine pairs of truncation matrices are at hand, we can perform a truncation transformation
on every geometric bond of the tensor network. Generally, for each step of the imaginary-time projection and truncation, we
need to make only one full contraction procedure for the environment, but has to solve nine times the truncation matrix by the
variational optimization.
