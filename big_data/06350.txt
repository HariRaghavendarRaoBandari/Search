Dark Matter in Earth intersecting orbits can scatter oﬀ the electrons and lose energy, and ﬁnally
be gravitationally bound to Earth. Eventually they lose enough energy and accumulate at the core.
It is assumed that DM annihilates/decays predominantly into Standard Model particles inside Earth.
The heat ﬂux from these processes is compared with the experimentally measured value of internal
heat ﬂux of Earth which is 44 TW. Assuming steady state between capture and annihilation/decay,
we put constraints on the scattering cross section of DM with electrons as a function of their
mass. For low mass regions (< 10−2GeV), these constraints on leptophilic DM are better than ones
obtained from direct-detection experiments.

INTRODUCTION

There is evidence for Dark Matter (DM) from rotation
curves of galaxies, and Bullet cluster [1], however there
is no ﬁrm evidence from direct detection in terrestrial
experiments. These experiments search for nuclear recoil
from coherent scattering of 10-100 GeV mass DM par-
ticles with heavy nuclei to put constraints on scattering
cross section.
In these experiments, the ionization of
electrons is assumed to be from the radioactivity in the
background, and only non-ionizing nuclear scatterings
are considered as evidence of DM signal. Consequently
the bounds on leptophilic DM which scatter only with
the electrons in the atoms are weak [14]. There are well
motivated models of leptophilic DM with mass in the
sub GeV range [3] and it will be of interest to put con-
straints on the scattering cross section from observations.

Fitting of the rotation curve of the milky way with
the DM proﬁle leads us to believe that DM has a speciﬁc
(NFW, Einasto, Isothermal etc.)
proﬁle in position
space and a Maxwellian distribution in the momentum
space. The density of the DM in solar neighborhood,
which is relevant for determining the scattering rates in
terrestrial experiments, is ﬁxed to be 0.4 GeV/cm3 in all
the proﬁles [2].

In this paper we investigate the capture of leptophilic
DM and their annihilation/decays in the Earth. DM in
earth intersecting orbits can scatter oﬀ electrons of the
earth and lose energy.
If these scattered DM particles
are gravitationally captured in an Earth bound orbit,
then eventually they can accumulate inside Earth. These
DM particles can annihilate/decay into SM particles
and impart their energy to the kinetic energy of atoms.
Assuming a steady state between accumulation and
annihilations/decays, we predict the heat produced in
the Earth from this process. The heat ﬂux of earth

has been experimentally measured to be around 44
TW [4]. Measurement of geo-neutrinos tell us that
20-25 TW is contributed by the nuclear reactions in
the Earth [5]. The source for remaining heat output is
uncertain. We take the conservative estimate of 20 TW
as the upper limit of heating by DM annihilations, and
put constraints on scattering cross section and mass of
leptophilic DM.

In Sec. II we calculate the capture rate and the total
accretion rate of DM by Earth.
III we calcu-
late the heat ﬂux by annihilations/decays of DM inside
Earth. In Sec. IV we discuss our results and compare
with existing bounds.

It is assumed that the galatic Dark Matter is thermal
and follows Maxwellian distribution characterised by rms
velocity, ¯v = 110 km/s. The rate of particles coming
from a unit surface element located on a sphere of radius
R centered at Earth is then given by, [8]

respectively. In terms of these new variables, the total ac-

To determine what fraction of these particles is cap-
tured by Earth, we must determine region of the (x, y)
parameter space which kinematically scatters into bound
orbits. This is achieved by imposing the following con-
ditions, (i) the perigee of orbit intersects the Earth and,
(ii) the particles are trapped by gravitational inﬂuence of
Earth.

A. Perigee Constraint

The ﬁrst condition we impose on the particles is for
their trajectories should intersect Earth. For Keplerian
orbits, the distance of closest approach is given as, [6],

To ensure that the incident DM particle travels a dis-
tance of one Earth radius (RE) inside Earth, we require
that rperi ≤ 0.86RE. In terms of the dimensionless vari-
ables, this is equivalent to,

y ≤ 1.48x + 1.72

(7)

This appears as an upper limit of integration in the

x-y parameter space.

B. Gravitational Trapping by Earth

Having restricted our DM particles to the ones that
intersect Earth, now we look at the number of times these
particles interact with the electrons of Earth in crossing
RE. The mean free path between two scatterings is given
by,

λχ =

1

σχene

(8)

where ne is the number density of electrons in Earth. To
estimate this number, we assume net electric charge neu-
trality, and thus the number of electrons and protons in
Earth is same. The proton to neucleon fraction is esti-
mated by considering the composition of Earth which is
32.1 % Iron, 30.1% Oxygen, 15.1% Silicon, 13.9% Mag-
nesium, 2.9% Sulphur, 1.8% Nickel, 1.5% Calcium, 1.4%
Aluminium, and other trace elements [13]. This results
in,

ne = 0.48

ME
Mp

× 1

4
3 πR3

= 1.6 × 1030m−3

(9)

where ME = 6×1024kg is the mass of Earth. The typical
number of scattering can be approximated by,
= RE × σχe × ne ≡ σχe
σcrit

Ns ≈ RE
λχ

(10)

.

For Earth, σcrit ≈ 9.5 × 10−38m2. When σχe > σcrit,
DM will deﬁnitely scatter from the electrons. But, when
σχe < σcrit, the probablity of scattering is proportional
to Ns [8]. This constant of proportiality was evaluated
in [8] to be of order unity and can be ignored for sake
of approximation. The probability of scattering can thus
be writted in the form,

g(σ) = θ(σ − σcrit) +

θ(σcrit − σ)

σ

σcrit

(11)

where θ(x) is the Heaviside Theta function.

After Ns scatterings, the DM particle must remain
in the gravitational inﬂuence of earth. This, along with
the perigee constraint, guarantees that the particle will
re-renter Earth’s surface and subsequently lose more
energy via scatterings. Eventually it will drift to the
core of earth where it annihilates or decays.

where the term in parenthesis will be subsequently rep-
resented by f (µ = mχ/me). After Ns such scatterings,
the ﬁnal speciﬁc energy of the DM particle will be

Ef = f (µ)NsEi.

(13)

After each scattering, apogee of the DM orbit decreases.
If the apogee is outside the Hill spehere of Earth, then
there is a possibility that the particle may be captured
by the Sun. For an astronomical object, Hill sphere is the
region in which it dominates the attraction of satellites.
Hence we impose a condition that the apogee of scattered
orbit must be inside the Hill sphere of Earth which is
calculated as,

(cid:18) ME

(cid:19)1/3

.

3M(cid:12)

RH = a

(14)
Here, a = 1 A.U., and M(cid:12) = 3 × 1030 kg is the mass of
Sun. Substituting the values, we obtain RH = 0.01 A.U.
The maximum ﬁnal velocity for the DM particle can be
written as,

vf = βw

(15)

where β = 0.9957, and w is the escape velocity as deﬁned
before. From Eq.(13) and Eq. (15) one obtains an upper
limit on variable x as,

xmax =

β2
f (µ)N .

(16)

3

We can solve the diﬀerential equation (18) to obtain,

N (t) = Fτ (1 − exp−t/τ )

(21)

Although we do not attain equilibrium, after a long time
(few times the lifetime τ ), the decay rate of DM is given
as,

ΓD =

N (t → ∞)

τ

≈ F

The heat produced due to decaying DM is thus,

Hdec = ΓD × mχ = F × mχ

For DM characterised by thermal-averaged annihila-

tion cross section (cid:104)σv(cid:105), the annihilaion rate is

(27)

The total number (N) of DM particles inside Earth

follows the relation,

˙N = F − 2ΓA − ΓD

(18)
where F, ΓA, ΓD are the capture, annihilation, and decay
rates respectively. The DM phase space distribution can
be approximated by a thermal distribution depending on
local gravitational potential [10].

n(r) = n0e−mχφ(r)/kbT

(19)

We consider the cases of self annihilating DM and decay-
ing DM separately.

A. Decaying DM

For DM characterised by lifetime τ , the decay rate is

(cid:19)

ΓD =

d3x n(x)

=

τ

(20)

Suﬃciently long after the equilibrium time τeq =

(2FA)−1/2, the annihilation rate is given as,

ΓA = AN 2(t → ∞) ≈ F/2

The heat ﬂux due to annihilating DM is thus,

HA = Γa × 2mχ = F × mχ.

(28)

(29)

In both the cases, one can see that the heat ﬂux after
equilibrium is given by F × mχ. It is assumed that the
DM annihilates into SM particles which deposit their
energy at core in form of heat. It is also assumed that
the branching ratio into invisible modes like neutrinos is
small.

As a model independent result, the parameter space in
σχe − mχ plane which produces more than 20 TW heat
is shown in Fig.3. It can be interpreted in the following
way:
for a given mass of DM, if the scattering cross
section is larger than a threshold value, too much DM
will be captured by Earth which results in overheating.

IV. RESULTS

robust bound cannot be established. The most reliable
and stringent bounds are established by Earth.

We obtain constraint for low mass DM which has not
been ruled out yet by direct detection experiments. Sim-
ilar analysis has been performed for Moon’s heat ﬂux as
measured by Apollo 15 and 17 [11]. Voyager 1 measured
the internal heat ﬂux of Jupiter and found anomalously
large output [12]. As of now, there is no concrete expla-
nation for this heat output. However if we assume that
the future experiments and analysis can account for 80-
90% of this heat, we can put constraint using remainder
of Jupiters heat. This is shown in the Fig. 2 below.

In Fig.3 we have shown the current bounds on sub-gev
dark-matter as calculated in [14] and the new bounds
from this paper. One can see that this parameter space
for light leptophilic DM has not yet been ruled out by
direct detection experiments.

V. CONCLUSIONS

After analysing capture of local dark matter by Earth,
we have found novel contraints on scattering cross
section for leptopilic dark matter with electrons. We put
new limit on the cross section of leptophilic DM in the
mass range 1 eV - 3 MeV, which has not been probed
by direct detection experiments yet. This result will be
useful for testing already established and future models
of leptophilic dark matter with mass in sub-MeV domain.

FIG. 2. The constraints from Moon (dotted), Earth (dashed)
and Jupiter (dot-dashed) are shown.

The bounds for Jupiter should not be taken too seri-
ously for two reasons. First, the data is not reliable as
the measurements were not in situ as opposed to Earth
and Moon. Secondly, the internal heat ﬂux of Jupiter is
so large, even if all the incident DM is captured, the heat
produced is of the order of total internal heat. Hence a
