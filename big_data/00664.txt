The charged pion multiplicity ratio in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions, a probe of the
density dependence of symmetry energy above the saturation point, has been proven in a previous
study to be extremely sensitive to the strength of the isovector ∆(1232) potential in nuclear matter.
As there is no current knowledge, either from theory or experiment, about the magnitude of this
quantity, the extraction of constraints for the slope of the symmetry energy at saturation by using
exclusively the mentioned observable is hindered at present.
It is shown that, by including the
ratio of average pT of charged pions hp(π+)
i in the list of ﬁtted observables, the noted
problem can be circumvented. A realistic description of this observable requires the accounting for
the interaction of pions with the dense nuclear matter environment by the incorporation of the so
called S-wave and P-wave pion optical potentials. This is performed within the framework of a
QMD transport model that enforces the conservation of the total energy of the system. It is shown
that constraints for the slope of the symmetry energy at saturation density and the strength of the
∆(1232) potential can be simultaneously extracted. A symmetry energy with a value of the slope
parameter L > 20 MeV is favored, at 3σ conﬁdence level, from a comparison with published FOPI
experimental data. A precise constraint will require experimental data more accurate than presently
available, particularly for the charged pion multiplicity ratio, and better knowledge of the density
and momentum dependence of the pion potential for the whole range of these two variables probed
in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions.

INTRODUCTION

Pions produced in intermediate energy heavy-ion col-
lisions have been shown to provide promising means to
study the isovector part of the equation of state (asy-
EoS) of nuclear matter, commonly known as the symme-
try energy (SE). The multiplicity ratio of charged pions
(PMR) has been proven to be sensitive to the density
dependence of SE, in particular to the slope of SE at sat-
uration, while uncertainties in the isoscalar part of the
equation of state are suppressed [1]. The impact of SE
on PMR has been shown to grow larger as the energy of
the incident beam is decreased.

Attempts to constrain the slope of the SE at satura-
tion by making use of various transport models and the
experimentally measured value for the PMR in central
197Au+197Au at an impact energy of 400 MeV/nucleon
have resulted in a confusing picture: constraints on the
high density dependence of the SE ranging from a very
soft to a stiﬀ one have been extracted [2–4], or even no
sensitivity on the slope parameter has been reported [5].
Additionally, most models have led to a contradiction be-
tween the π−/π+ multiplicity ratio and neutron/proton
elliptic ﬂow ratio extracted constraints for the SE stiﬀ-
ness. Eﬀorts to ﬁnd a solution to this problem by
studying the impact of in-medium modiﬁcations of the

pion-nucleon interaction [6], the kinetic part of the SE
term [7], the neutron skin thickness [8] or particle pro-
duction threshold shifts due to the inclusion of self-energy
contributions [9, 10] on the PMR value have proven, from
a quantitative point of view, largely unsuccessful, but
some interesting ﬁndings were nevertheless reported.

The impact of including the self-energy contributions
in the constraint of energy conservation that appears in
the collision term of the transport equations, and thus
implicitly modifying particle production thresholds, has
been explored in Refs. [9, 10]. Such an approach leads
to a manifest implementation of energy conservation at
local level, i.e. only the total energy of the particles in-
volved in a binary reaction is conserved. It has lead to the
interesting result that a stiﬀer asy-EoS leads to a slightly
larger PMR than a soft choice would, which is opposite
to the result obtained when the self-energy contributions
to the energy conservation constraint are neglected. The
eﬀect was however found not to be quantitatively large
enough to allow the extraction, from a comparion with
experimental data, of the value for the slope L of the SE
at saturation.

The next step was taken in Ref. [11], where a transport
model which enforces the conservation of the total energy
of the entire system during heavy-ion reactions has been
developed. A restriction of the model to the so called lo-
cal total energy conservation scenario has conﬁrmed the
results of Refs. [9, 10]. The requirement of global total
energy conservation was reported to have an important
impact on pion multiplicities, particularly π−, preserving

the sensitivity of the PMR to the SE stiﬀness, but en-
hancing strongly the inversion phenomenon reported in
Ref. [10]. However, a large dependence of PMR’s magni-
tude on the strength of the isovector part of the ∆(1232)
potential was evidenced, which, in view of the lack of in-
formation on this quantity, rendered this observable un-
suitable for constraining the density dependence of the
SE. This is in contrast with conclusions regarding the
impact of the ∆(1232) potential on pionic observables
reached in Refs. [12, 13].
It is however not a conﬂict
since in these lastly mentioned studies the threshold ef-
fects generated by the conservation of the total energy
have not been accounted for, the impact of the ∆ (1232)
baryon arising only due to its motion in the mean-ﬁeld.
Owing to the short lifetime of this resonance, the impact
of its in-medium potential on pionic spectra is modest
for values of the impact energy for which experimental
data are available. Another important conclusion of the
study in Ref. [11] was that for the standard choice for the
strength of the isovector ∆(1232) potential, equal to that
of the nucleon, an almost perfect agreement between the
pion and elliptic ﬂow extracted SE constraints could be
obtained.

i/hp(π−)

The present study extends the analysis performed
in Ref. [11] to the average pT ratio of charged pions,
hp(π+)
i (PAPTR). It is shown that by using both
observables, PMR and PAPTR, constraints for the stiﬀ-
ness of the SE can be extracted,
independent of the
strength of the isovector ∆(1232) potential. Constraints
for the latter are naturally a bi-product of such a study.
To achieve this goal, the model of Ref. [11] is further
improved by including the optical potential of pions in
nuclear matter, both the so called S and P-wave compo-
nents [14, 15]. All the relevant details of this development
are presented in Section II. The impact of this quantity
on multiplicities, multiplicity spectra and average pT val-
ues of pions is studied in detail, and, where available, a
comparison with experimental FOPI data [16–18] is pre-
sented. Additionally, the impact of poorer known model
parameters is also investigated, followed by a presenta-
tion of the extracted constraints for SE (Section III). We
end with a Section devoted to summary and conclusions.

II. THE MODEL

A. The Transport Model

The transport model of Ref. [11] and references therein
is used to simulate intermediate energy heavy-ion col-
lisions.
The Gogny inspired momentum dependent
parametrization of the equation of state of nuclear mat-
ter [19] has been selected to describe the mean-ﬁeld expe-
rienced by a nucleon at ﬁnite density. Its isovector part
contains a parameter, denoted x, which allows the adjust-
ment of the stiﬀness of the symmetry energy. Negative
and positive values of this parameter correspond to a stiﬀ
and a soft density dependence, respectively. Some small

2

modiﬁcations, besides the inclusion of the pion optical
potential, were however implemented and are described
in the following together with their implications on ob-
servables.

In the previous version, the radius mean square (rms)
of initialized nuclei was determined solely from the po-
sition of the centroids of the wave function of nucleons.
This is however inaccurate for the case of gaussian type
nucleon wave functions of ﬁnite width, as used in QMD
transport models, leading to an eﬀective larger rms. The
appropriate expression reads

hr2i =

i=1

LN ,

(1)

where LN is the square of the nucleon wave function
width, the used convention for the parametrization of the
nucleon wave function being the same as in Ref. [20]. The
diﬀerence between the previously used and the appro-
priate value grows with increasing wave function width,
reaching about 10% for values customarily used in trans-
port models in connection with heavy nuclei. While the
impact on pion multiplicities in central collisions is small,
leaving the results of Ref. [11] unchanged, the impact on
ﬂow observables in mid-central and, especially, periph-
eral collisions is non-negligible. The somewhat larger val-
ues for the SE slope parameter at saturation extracted
in Ref [21] are corrected downwards by as much as 25
MeV, bringing the extracted constraints for the SE slope
parameter from elliptic ﬂow in Refs. [21, 22] closer to-
gether. The value for the wave function width in this
study is chosen to be LN =4.33 fm2, guided by the abil-
ity of reproducing nuclear density proﬁles, particularly
towards the surface of the nucleus.

In contrast to previous versions of the model, the pion
is also associated a ﬁnite width wave function, which
is introduced for consistency reasons in order to eval-
uate the pion-nucleon Coulomb and density dependent
strong interactions in the same fashion as their nucleon-
nucleon counterpart. The value of the square of wave
function width of the pion is set to half of that of the nu-
cleon, Lπ=0.5 LN , which is a close approximation of the
experimentally measured squared ratio of their charge
radii [23]. Additionally, the strength of the Coulomb in-
teraction has been slightly adjusted (decreased by 10%
compared to its standard value) in order to reproduce
more closely, than in previous versions of the model,
the Coulomb binding energy contribution to the empiri-
cal mass formula, which for 197Au is approximately 3.72
MeV/nucleon [24]. This step is justiﬁed by the implicit
dependence of the Coulomb interaction on the value of
the wave function width of nucleons (and pions). The
impact of this modiﬁcation on pion is non-negligible, as
it will be shown in Section III, given its eﬀective isovector
nature, leading to lower values for both the PMR and the
PAPTR. The value of the elliptic ﬂow ratio of neutrons
and protons is however only slightly modiﬁed.

Most of the results presented in this article have been
obtained by enforcing conservation of the total energy of

the system during a heavy-ion collision, by including the
potential energies in the energy conservation constraint
imposed when determining the ﬁnal state of a 2-body
scattering, decay or absorption process,

in nuclei via a modiﬁcation of the isovector S-wave πN
scattering amplitude [35–39].

A commonly used parametrization for the pion optical
potential in the context of studying pionic atoms, intro-
duced by Ericson and Ericson [15], reads

both indexes running over all particles present in the sys-
tem and correspoding, from left to right, to the ﬁnal and
initial states of an elementary reaction. This scenario
has been referred to as the “global energy conservation”
(GEC) scenario in [11]. Additionally, the “local energy
conservation” (LEC) and “vacuum energy conservation”
(VEC) scenarios have been introduced. They correspond
to the situation when only the potential energies of the
particles directly involved in the 2-body scattering, de-
cay or absorption process are accounted for in the energy
conservation constraint and when the potential energies
of particles in the medium are ignored in the collision
term, respectively. For further details about these ap-
proximations we refer the reader to Ref. [11].

It will prove useful to mention the used Ansatz for
the potential of ∆(1232) and heavier baryonic reso-
nances [25],

V∆− = VN + (3/2) Vv
V∆0 = VN + (1/2) Vv
V∆+ = VN − (1/2) Vv
V∆++ = VN − (3/2) Vv,

(3)

where VN is the isoscalar nucleon potential and Vv=δ,
with the deﬁnition δ=(1/3)(Vn-Vp). By varying the mag-
nitude of Vv diﬀerent scenarios for the strength of the
isovector baryon potential can be explored. The choices
Vv=-2 δ, δ, 0, δ, 2 δ and 3 δ will be used in this study.
The last choice leads, in the case of a momentum inde-
pendent potential, to no threshold eﬀects. The results of
this case for the PMR resemble that of transport models
that do not take into account the potential energies in
the energy conservation constraint in collision, decay or
absorption processes [11].

B. The Pion Optical Potential

Theoretical and experimental studies of the pion-
nucleus interactions date back to the 50’s decade of the
previous century. Theoretically motivated parametriza-
tions of the so called pion optical potentials introduced
back then [14, 15] are still in current use when comparing
diﬀerent versions of the potential derived either theoreti-
cally from microscopical models [26–29] or extracted from
a comparison of eﬀective models to experimentally mea-
sured data for pion-nucleus scattering [30–32] or proper-
ties of pionic atoms [33–35]. The last mentioned studies
have also been motivated by the opportunity to inves-
tigate a possible partial restoration of chiral symmetry

where

q(r) = ǫ1(¯b0ρ + ¯b1βρ) + ǫ2B0ρ2,
α(r) = ǫ−1

1 (c0ρ + c1βρ) + ǫ−1

2 (C0ρ2 + C1βρ2).

In the above expressions µ is the reduced mass of the
pion-nucleus system and λ is the Lorentz-Lorentz correc-
tion parameter which accounts for the impact of short-
range nucleon-nucleon correlations on the potential. The
extra parameters are deﬁned as follows: ǫ1=1+mπ/mN ,
ǫ2=1+mπ/2mN , with mπ and mN the π-meson and nu-
cleon masses respectively. Coordinate dependence of the
potentials enters through the expressions for the density ρ
and the isospin asymmetry β. The parameters ¯b0, ¯b1 and
B0 determine the strength of the S-wave part of the in-
teraction, while the P-wave term is described by the ones
labeled c0, c1, C0 and C1. Parameters denoted by capital
letters can have both a real and an imaginary part while
the others are real. During the last decades, many sets
for the optical potential parameter values have been ex-
tracted by ﬁtting available experimental data, mainly pi-
onic atoms properties and pion-nucleus scattering cross-
sections. Some diﬀerences do however exist between the
many available sets for each parameter and are under-
stood as being due to diﬀerences in the ﬁtting procedure,
some small correction terms (e.g. angular transformation
terms, Pauli blocking and Fermi averaging [31]) included
or omitted by the various analyses or somewhat diﬀerent
experimental data sets. A limited number of such pa-
rameter sets, which were used in the present study, are
presented in Tab. (I). A more comprehensive list can be
found in Ref. [33] from where the entries listed in Tab. (I)
were selected.

As pointed out by several authors [30, 31, 43, 44], the
density regimes probed in pionic atoms and elastic pion-
nucleus scattering experiments are 0.5-0.75ρ0 and 0.0-
0.5ρ0 respectively. For the pionic atoms case also the
momentum of the pion is drastically limited to p<0.050
GeV/c (or equivalently pion kinetic energies ω < 9 MeV).
Extrapolating the pion potentials to values of these two
variables probed in heavy-ion collisions of impact ener-
gies in the range 200-500 MeV/nucleon (0.0-2.5ρ0 for
density and 0.0-0.3 GeV/c for pion momentum) leads to
unavoidable inaccuracies which originate from the noted
diﬀerences in the potential parameters values and may
be viewed as model dependence. We will attempt to es-
timate its magnitude by determining the observables of
interest for diﬀerent choices of the pionic potentials.

Alternatively, the pion optical potential can be de-
termined theoretically within the framework of eﬀective

hadronic models. Starting from basic interaction terms
for the πNN, πN∆ and in some cases also πNN∗(1440)
vertices one can determine the pion potential by com-
puting the in-medium pion self-energy in a perturbative
approach, the lowest order corresponding to a linear den-
sity approximation when the energy dependence of the
interaction is neglected. Models that go beyond the low-
est order in density are available in the literature, both
for S-wave [27–29, 43, 45] and P-wave [27, 28, 46] com-
ponents of the potential. Their validity is restricted to
sub-saturation densities and for the most sophisticated
ones [28, 29] also to rather low values of the pion kinetic
energy, ω < 50 MeV. Similar problems as the ones noted
above occur also when attempting to use these theoreti-
cally determined potentials in simulations of intermediate
energy HICs.

Extrapolations of the empirically or theoretically de-
rived potentials to pion kinetic energies and densities
higher than the ones they are appropriate for must pro-
ceed with care. The treatment of the S and P wave com-
ponents is necessarily diﬀerent. We begin with the S-
wave potential. As already mentioned, the original goal
of studying pionic atoms was to investigate the possibility
of a partial restoration of chiral symmetry inside dense
nuclear matter. To this end, the isoscalar and isovector
πN center-of-mass scattering amplitudes at threshold in
dense nuclear matter, ¯b0 and ¯b1 need to be compared to
their free-space counterparts, b0 and b1. For these latter
ones the extracted values from pionic hydrogen and deu-
terium X-ray experiments [47] and theoretical predictions
from chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) [48, 49] agree
reasonably well and are more over well approximated by
the Weinberg-Tomozawa (WT) lowest-order chiral limit,
as presented in Tab. (II).

Initial extraction of the values of ¯b0 and ¯b1 (at ﬁnite
density) from experimental data of pionic atoms revealed
an unusual large repulsion in the isoscalar channel [50], as
is also evident from Tab. (I), which seemed to contradict
the expectation of how chiral symmetry restoration is
realized in nature. It was later recognized that, for the
isoscalar channel, double-scattering contributions play a
crucial role due to cancellations in the single scattering
amplitude that lead to an almost zero isoscalar term at

of the magnitude of ¯b0 at ﬁnite density originates from
the isovector term due to identical particle correlations
in nuclear matter leading to the relation

which needs to be supplement by additional less well un-
derstood corrections, such as coherent neutron and pro-
ton scattering lengths or dispersive eﬀects of nuclear pion
absorption, in order for a quantitative agreement to be
reached [51].

suggest that in-medium eﬀects on the πN scattering am-

Using these considerations it can be shown that a sat-
isfactory description of pionic atoms and pion-nucleus

elastic scattering can be achieved with values for b0 and
b1 in Eq. (5) compatible with the vacuum ones listed
in Tab. (II), once the energy dependence of the πN am-
plitudes and realistic neutron and protons density proﬁles
inside the nucleus are also taken into account [38, 56, 57].
It can be additionally shown that, by enforcing gauge
invariance by minimal substitution in the Klein-Gordon
equation used to describe pionic atoms, S-wave pion po-
tentials with ReB0=0.0 (in units of m−4
π ) are compatible
with experimental data with the magnitude of the imag-
inary partly largely unaﬀected by any of the details of
the scenario employed [58].

As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the energy
dependence of the S-wave potential is also important for
the description of experimental data away from threshold
(pion-nucleus scattering). In the leading order approxi-
mation of ChPT (pion kinetic energy smaller than pion
rest mass) the dominant energy dependence originates
from b0. This result is supported by the energy depen-
dence of empirical free-space πN amplitudes that have
been extracted from experimental data (see for example
Ref. [59]), which advocate slopes of the potential parame-
ters b0 and b1 of -0.00053 m−1
π /MeV and a negligible one
respectively. Analyses of low energy pion-nucleus scatter-
ing arrive at a qualitatively identical conclusion [30–32],
additionally presenting evidence of a dampening of the
energy dependence of the isoscalar term of the S-wave
scattering amplitudes in nuclear matter as compared to
free space.

Consequently, in the simulations presented in the next
Section the values of b0 and its slope were chosen with the
conservative requirement of satisfying the experimental
constraints derived from pion-nucleus scattering for the
so called eﬀective isoscalar scattering amplitude ¯beﬀ
[43]:
0
b0 = −0.010 m−1
π and db0/dEkin = −0.00016 m−1
π /MeV.
It is deﬁned as: ¯beﬀ
0 = ¯b0+ρeﬀ Re B0 [30], neglecting small
corrections proportional to the ratio between the pion ki-
netic energy and the mass of the nucleus under consider-
ation, with ρeﬀ being the eﬀective density at which the
potential needs to be evaluated at a given pion kinetic
energy.

This approach accounts, even though in a rather qual-
itative manner, for modiﬁcations, induced by the dense
medium, of the slopes of the energy dependence of the
parameters of the potential. The non-zero value of b0,
diﬀerent from its free-space value (see Tab. (II)), eﬀec-
tively accounts for the omitted corrections in the pro-
cess of deriving Eq. (5) [51] at ﬁnite density. The de-
scribed procedure to account for the energy dependence
of the pion-nucleon scattering amplitudes resembles the
approach employed in pionic atoms studies [58]. The an-
alytical dependence on energy of the theoretical S-wave
pion potential of Ref. [28] is however diﬀerent, leading to
a smaller energy slope of ¯b0 but to an energy dependent
¯b1 (see the right panel of Fig. (1)).

The following S-wave potential will be used in the nu-
merical simulation of heavy-ion collisions, if not other-
wise stated. For b0 we use the slope extracted above

5

from experimental pion-nucleus elastic scattering, while
for b1 we use a linearized approximation of Eq. (8) that
is applicable (non-singular) to the entire density interval
probed by intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions,

(cid:17).

Both potential parameters in the expressions above are
expressed in units of [m−1
π ], while the kinetic energy of
the pion, Ekin is expressed in units of [MeV]. The val-
ues of the parameters entering in Eq. (4) are determined
from Eq. (5) for ¯b0 and ¯b1 = b1(ρ) for ¯b1. It needs to be
stressed that the above choice for b1 (together with the
one in Eq. (8)) may not be a very good approximation
far away from the low density region, however neglecting
the density dependence of b1 completely may arguably
be a worse approximation. The precise (realistic) depen-
dence on density of ¯b1 for the entire density domain of
interest in this study is presently unknown and any ex-
trapolation of low density ChPT results of the type of
the one in Eq. (9) introduces unavoidable uncertainties
in the results.

We conclude the discussion of the S-wave potential
by presenting, in Fig. (1), the density (left panel) and
momentum (right panel) dependence of the empirical S-
wave potentials of Tab. (I), of the theoretical model
of Nieves et al . [28] and the eﬀective model presented
above. The isoscalar and to a lesser extent also the
isovector components are compatible with each other in
the density region probed in pionic atoms experiments,
their strength diﬀer however substantially in the supra-
saturation region. Only the theoretical and eﬀective
models for the S-wave pion potential present a momen-
tum dependence, which are rather diﬀerent from each
other, the latter having a stronger dependence in the
isoscalar channel and none for the isovector case.

to

Turning

the P-wave potential, we notice
from Tab. (I) that, by using the concept of eﬀec-
tive density [30], the various sets of potentials extracted
from pionic atoms present isoscalar components of
similar strength, while for the isovector term c1 the
strength varies, in absolute magnitude, by a factor of
three and consequently also the ratio of the strengths of
the isovector and isoscalar components varies within a
similar range. This is visible in the left panel of Fig. (2)
where the density dependence of the isoscalar and
isovector P-wave potentials at a value of the pion
momentum p=0.125 GeV is presented. Additionally,
two theoretical pion P-wave pion potentials are also
depicted, whose strength is systematically smaller than
that of the empirical ones extracted from pionic atoms
data.
It is expected that the mentioned diﬀerences
may have an important impact on observables that
probe the isovector part of the interaction. The strong
dependence of the P-wave potential on pion momentum
and the rather important dependence of the average pion
momentum on the isospin in heavy-ion collisions leads

FIG. 2: (Color online) The same as in Fig. (1), but for the P-wave potential. In this case the results of two theoretical models
are shown, namely the one of Nieves et al . [28] and that of Garcia-Recio et al . [46]. As discussed in the text the momentum
dependence of the P-wave potentials extracted from pionic atoms data has been extrapolated using the momentum dependence
of the latter theoretical model. The presented results correspond to the case of uniform nuclear matter of given density and
isospin asymmetry β=0.2. Consequently, the density gradient term that appears in Eq. (4) does not contribute.

to an eﬀective isovector behavior also of the isoscalar
P-wave terms. This fact stresses the importance of an
accurate knowledge of the pion potential.

A realistic dependence on momentum of the P-wave
potential is therefore crucial, as will be shown for the
observables of interest in Section III. The evident p2 de-
pendence from Eq. (4) is only valid at small pion kinetic
energies and far away from the position of the pole masses
of excitable baryonic resonances. This requirement is
fulﬁlled in the case of pionic atoms. As the energy is
increased and the lowest lying resonance, ∆(1232), is ex-
cited, the dependence of the pion P-wave potential on

momentum is modiﬁed, inﬂuenced primarily by the en-
ergy dependence of the decay width of the resonance in
question. A precise energy dependence of the potential
can currently only be inferred from models that can de-
termine the pion self-energy in nuclear matter for a wide
enough kinetic energy range. In this respect, the theo-
retical model of Ref. [46], based on a local approximation
of the delta-hole model, has allowed a good description
of pion nucleus scattering up to kinetic energies of the
incident pion of about 300 MeV. While more sophisti-
cated models do exist in the literature [28], they have a
limited range of applicability (pion kinetic energy ω ≤50

MeV) and consequently present an (unrealistic) increase
in strength with ω even for invariant mass above the po-
sition of the ∆(1232) resonances. We also consider ex-
trapolations of such a potential, above its range of appli-
cability, by using three-level type models for the pion-self
energy in nuclear matter, as the one proposed in Ref. [60],
and used recently in [61], as inaccurate since the width
of the ∆(1232), not just its energy dependence, is com-
pletely neglected in this cases. We adopt in this study
the energy dependence of the P-wave potential derived
in Ref. [46]. In practice, this is achieved by multiplying
the P-wave part of the potential of Eq. (4) by the form
factor,

with Λ1 = 0.55 GeV and Λ2 = 0.22 GeV. The expres-
sion in the numerator ensures that for a value of the
pion momentum equal to that of the average one in a
2p state of a heavy pionic atom (peﬀ = 0.05 GeV) the
strength of the potential as extracted from pionic atom
measurements is reproduced. In Section III, in order test
the sensitivity of the observables to various isoscalar and
isovector strengths of the P-wave potential, results will
be presented for all potentials listed in Tab. (I) and also
for the potential of Nieves et al . [28].

The momentum dependence of the pion P wave po-
tentials of Tab. (I) and of the theoretical models of
Nieves et al . [28] and Garcia-Recio [46] is depicted in the
right panel of Fig. (2) for the isoscalar (s) and isovector
(v) components separately. The features described in the
previous paragraph are readily observable and, as in the
case of the density dependence, the theoretical models
exhibit weaker attraction than the empirical ones.

Due to the dependence of the density and isospin asym-
metry parameters on the spatial coordinates, the gradient
operator in Eq. (4) leads, besides the term proportional
to p2, also to terms in the potential proportional to ~p· ~∇ρ
and ~p · ~∇β. They can in principle be of relevance in the
study of pionic atoms [15] since in this case the pion
probes mostly the region close to the surface of the nu-
cleus. Theoretical investigations on this topic make use
of density proﬁles of nuclei that lead to constant isospin
asymmetry [33, 36] within the nucleus and consequently
the isospin asymmetry gradient term does not contribute.
In order to be consistent with the studies that have lead
to the pion potentials of Tab. (I) we will therefore ne-
glect the terms in the potential proportional to ~p · ~∇β.
The terms proportional to the density gradient will be
however kept.

Their relevance can be inferred from Fig. (3), in which
the ratio of the strengths of density gradient terms in
the potential and of the p2 term of P-wave potential as a
function of momentum of the pion, for several choices of
the P-wave potential parameter set and a modulus of the
radius vector for which the density gradient is maximum,
are presented. The calculations have been performed for

tional to p2 (Vnon−loc) for the π− (bottom) and π+ (top)
mesons. Results for various choices of the P-wave poten-
tial parameter set (see Tab. (I)) are presented. The calcu-
lation has been performed for a 197Au nucleus whose den-
sity proﬁle can be parametrized by the simple expression
ρ(r) = ρ0/(1 + exp[(r − R)/a]), with ρ0=0.165 fm−3, R=6.40
fm and a=0.60 fm. The value of the coordinate r is chosen
such as to maximize the magnitude of the density gradient,
which for the chosen parametrization occurs at the location
at which ρ=ρ0/2 and hence r=R. The spread of the results
for the chosen parameters sets of the P wave potential is es-
sentially given by the variation of the magnitude of ImC0
between the diﬀerent potentials.

the case of a 197Au nucleus with the density proﬁle as
speciﬁed in the caption of Fig. (3) and outward radial
pion momentum orientation. Results for the π− and
π+ mesons are presented in the bottom and top panels
of Fig. (3) respectively. It is readily observed that in both
cases the relative strength of the gradient term potential
is stronger at lower momenta, where is becomes the domi-
nant contribution to the total pion P-wave potential. At
higher momenta this relative contribution decreases to
about or even below 10%. Additionally, a variation of
the relative strength of the density gradient term within
a factor of 2 between the diﬀerent choices for the P-wave
potential is observed, which can be predominantly linked
to the value of ImC0 parameter (see Tab. (I)), which sets
the strength of two-body pion absorption processes. In
the case of heavy-ion collisions, density gradients of com-
parable magnitude with the ones encountered in the skin
of nuclei are produced over a wider range of density val-
ues. It is thus mandatory to investigate the impact of the
density gradient term of the P-wave potential on pionic
observables.

We conclude this Section by presenting, in Fig. (4),
the π− (bottom panel) and π+ (top panel) total S+P
pion potential in uniform nuclear matter as a function
of density for various values of the pion momentum p.

The other possible combinations yield qualitatively the same
behavior. The repulsion generated by the density dependence

a net attractive to a net repulsive potential for ever increasing,

values of the pion momentum irrespective of density. At
higher momenta, the potential becomes attractive, how-
ever, as the density increases, the repulsive S-wave part
prevails resulting again in a net repulsive interaction.

III. PION POTENTIAL AND PION

OBSERVABLES

We begin by reporting on the impact the small
modiﬁcations to the transport model described in Sec-
tion II A have on the PMR. The results are presented
in Fig. (5), where a comparison between the PMR in
central 197Au+197Au central collisions at an impact en-
ergy of 400 MeV/nucleon for the case of the previous
version of the model [11] (dashed-dotted curve) and the
current one when ﬁrst the corrected expression of Eq. (1)
for rms is used (dashed curve), and then also the strength
of the Coulomb is adjusted to match its contribution to
the binding energy as provided by the empirical nuclear
mass formula (full curve), as described in Section II A,
is presented. The extracted value of the SE stiﬀness is
only marginally impacted by the correction to the rms
formula. On the other hand, the modiﬁcation of the
strength of the Coulomb interaction leads to a stiﬀer asy-

The ordinate x parametrizes the stiﬀness of the symmetry

a soft asy-EoS respectively. The horizontal band depicts the
experimental result of the FOPI Collaboration [17].

EoS, the increase of the extracted slope L of SE being of
the order of 15 MeV (see Tab.
I of Ref. [11] for the
connection between x and L).This is comparable with
the precision this parameter is extracted from the most
recent elliptical ﬂow results of the ASYEOS Collabora-
tion [62].

The study reported in Ref. [11] has demonstrated that
the ratio of charged pions multiplicity is equally sensi-
tive to both the stiﬀness of the SE and the strength of
the isovector ∆(1232) potential in nuclear matter. Con-
sequently, constraints for the slope L of the SE at sat-
uration cannot be extracted unambiguously without a
proper knowledge of the latter. The only solution out
of this problem, given that no information about the
isovector ∆(1232) potential is available from either the-
ory or experiment, is to enlarge the set of observables
from which the unknown parameters of the model are
extracted. Obvious candidates are the average ﬁnal mo-
menta (or kinetic energies) of charged pions. To isolate
the isovector signal, similar to the case of multiplicities,
it will prove useful to construct their ratio. In addition
to multiplicities, the FOPI experiment has also measured
the ﬁnal transverse momenta of pions and results for the
ratio of average pT of π+ and π− are available in the
literature for several systems and impact kinetic energy
equal to or higher than 400 MeV/nucleon [16]. We will
therefore present results and compare with the available
experimental data [16, 18], where appropriate, for aver-
age transverse momentum of pions and their ratio.

We will start by studying the impact the various energy
conservation scenarios, introduced in Ref. [11] and brieﬂy
described in Section II A, have on average pT of pions and

panel) as a function of the stiﬀness parameter x in central 197Au+197Au collision at an impact energy of 400 MeV/nucleon.
Results for the VEC (dashed-dotted curves), LEC (dashed curves) and GEC scenarios are presented. For the case of the GEC
scenario results for two strengths of the Coulomb interaction are shown: the one of Ref. [11] (dashed-double-dotted curves) and
the one used in this study (full curves). The FOPI experimental result for the PAPTR [16] is depicted by a horizontal band.

their ratio. The left-hand side panel of Fig. (6) presents
the impact of the VEC, LEC and GEC scenarios on the
pion average pT ratio (PAPTR). VEC and GEC scenario
simulations reveal values of PAPTR that overshoot the
experimental FOPI result [16] by 10-20%. On the other
hand the LEC scenario leads to PAPTR values below
their experimental counterpart by at most 10%. The im-
pact of local energy conservation (as compared to VEC)
is therefore much more pronounced for PAPTR than for
multiplicity ratios, while the diﬀerence between LEC and
GEC scenarios is equally dramatic for these two observ-
ables. Decreasing the strength of the Coulomb interac-
tion by 10%(previous vs. current versions of the model)
results in a reduction, in agreement with expectations,
of the PAPTR by about 5%. A moderate dependence
of PAPTR on the SE stiﬀness is also demonstrated, a
softer asy-EoS leading to a higher PAPTR for the VEC
and GEC scenarios and the opposite for LEC.

The right-hand side panel of Fig. (6) informs about
the sensitivity of the average transverse momenta of each
of the three charge pion states to the selected energy
conservation scenario.
It is shown that the low value
of PAPTR in the case of the LEC scenario originates
predominantly from the impact the local conservation of
energy (LEC) has on the average transverse momentum
of the π− meson. The same holds true for the origin
of the diﬀerences between the VEC and GEC scenarios
and the modiﬁcation on PAPTR induced by changing the
strength of the Coulomb interaction, even tough in this
cases the changes are much smaller in magnitude. These
observations are on par with the impact of the energy
conservation scenarios on pion multiplicities [11].

We will attempt to explain the remaining diﬀerence be-
tween the GEC result for PAPTR and its experimental

value by including the eﬀect of the pion-nucleus potential.
Since experimental values for pion average transverse mo-
menta were available only for mid-central collisions (3.35
fm < b < 6.0 fm) [18] we will study the impact of pion
potentials on pion observables for this impact parameter
range. It should be emphasized that for this case only
statistical uncertainties were at hand for the experimen-
tal values.
It will therefore not be possible to extract
constraints for the symmetry energy using this data set.
We begin by discussing the impact of S-wave potential
on pion multiplicities and average transverse momenta.
The results are presented in Fig. (7). The case when con-
tributions of the pion potential are omitted is presented
as a benchmark. The impact on multiplicities (left-hand
side panel) is stronger for the case of π− and generally a
S-wave potential that is stronger at saturation densities
and above leads to a stronger decrease of the multiplic-
ity in question. The most clearly visible example is that
of the Konijn-2 potential. The weaker SM-1 and Nieves
et al . potentials lead to the smallest change with respect
to the no pion potential case. Additionally, accounting
for the empirical momentum dependence of the S-wave
isoscalar strength is also observed to impact only slightly
pion multiplicities. Generally, the experimental value of
charged pions multiplicities are underestimated by the
model by fractions that show a weak isospin dependence.
The right-hand side panel of Fig. (7) presents the con-
clusions on the impact of S-wave potential on the average
transverse momenta of charged pions. The cases of π−
and π+ mesons are clearly diﬀerent. In the case of neg-
atively charged pions the impact always leads to higher
average transverse momenta, the strength of the mod-
iﬁcation being, similarly to pion multiplicities, in close
correlation to the strength of the potential close to sat-

FIG. 8: (Color online) Impact of the P-wave pion potential on pion multiplicities (left panel) and pion average transverse mo-
menta (right panel) in mid-central collisions (3.35 fm < b < 6.00 fm) of 197Au+197Au at an incident energy of 400 MeV/nucleon
for various choices of the P-wave potential, as presented in Section II B. The calculations labeled “No P wave potential” include
the impact of the eﬀective model S-wave pion potential alone. The same remarks for the experimental values (horizontal bands),
as the one made in the caption of Fig. (7), hold true.

uration density. Inclusion of S-wave potential leads pre-
dominantly to values that overestimate the experimental
FOPI value by at most 10%. In the case of the positively
charged pions the sign of the eﬀect of the S-wave poten-
tial on average pT varies with the chosen potential, but
in all cases the experimental values are over-predicted by
amounts in the range 5-20%. For the case of the theoret-
ical potential of Nieves et al . the impact is again among
the smallest for both charged pion states. The impact
of the momentum dependence part of the potential on
transverse momenta is however clearly visible, leading to

increases of these observables by 5-10%.

We next turn our attention to the impact of the P-wave
potential, which is presented in Fig. (8). In all cases pre-
sented in this ﬁgure the momentum dependent eﬀective
S-wave potential describe in Section II B and summa-
rized in the paragraph adjacent to Eq. (9) has also been
included, allowing a comparison of the full model with
the experimental data. From the left-hand side panel of
this ﬁgure the impact of the P-wave potential on multi-
plicities can be inferred. For both charged states it stays
below 10%, but is in relative magnitude bigger for the

positively charged pion. The impact of the density gra-
dient term of the potential is visible particularly for the
π+ meson leading to an increase of a few percent of its
multiplicity.

The impact of the P-wave pion potential on average pT
values is clearly more important as can be seen from the
right-hand side panel of Fig. (8).
Its attractive nature
leads to lower values of pT for all presented choices for
the P-wave potential, the relative impact amounting to
as much as 15%. Generally, the experimental values of
the π− and π+ transverse momenta cannot be described
simultaneously. This suggests that the isovector part of
the pion potential, as included in the present model, is
not accurate enough, either in strength or density de-
pendence. Additionally the density gradient term of the
P-wave potential is seen to have a discernible eﬀect, at
a few percent level, for both shown charge states of the
π meson. This result leads one to speculate of the possi-
ble relevance of the omitted isospin asymmetry gradient
term in the P-wave potential.

It is noteworthy to investigate separately the impact
of pion potentials on the observables of primary interest
for constraining the density dependence of the symmetry
energy. To this end the inﬂuence of the S and P-wave po-
tentials on PMR and PAPTR in mid-central collisions of
197Au+197Au nuclei at 400 MeV/nucleon impact energy
are presented in the left-hand and right-hand side panels
of Fig. (9) respectively. They are obviously derived from
the information presented in previous ﬁgures.

The inclusion of the S-wave pion potential leads in the
majority of cases to a smaller PMR, the impact on the
extracted slope parameter L of the SE amounting to as
much as 20 MeV towards stiﬀer values. The momen-
tum dependence of its isoscalar component inﬂuences the
PMR only modestly. A similar conclusion holds also for
the P-wave pion potential impact, the value of the PMR
is further reduced, pushing the extracted stiﬀness of the
asy-EoS to even higher values. From the right-hand side
panel of Fig. (9) an estimated impact of 20-40 MeV is ob-
tained. It is noteworthy to point out that the inﬂuence of
the density gradient term is important, pushing the PMR
to lower values. Most of the impact of the P-wave pion
potential on PMR is due to its gradient term . The com-
bined eﬀect of the S and P wave pion potential is to lower
the PMR and consequently push the extracted values of
L towards higher values by as much as 40-60 MeV. This
margin is comparable to the precision achieved in con-
straining the slope of the symmetry energy at saturation
using elliptical ﬂow data of the FOPI-LAND collabora-
tion [21, 22, 63], but a factor 2-3 larger than the fore-
seeable accuracy that will be reported in the near future
using the experimental results for the same observable
measured by the ASYEOS Collaboration [62].

Turning to PAPTR, it is readily observed that the in-
clusion of the S-wave pion potential leads, for all pre-
sented choices of the potential, to smaller values of this
observable. The model generally leads to values of this
observable higher than the experimental one, the discrep-

11

ancy growing larger towards stiﬀer values of L. As in the
case of the PMR, the impact of the momentum depen-
dent part of the isoscalar part of the S-wave pion poten-
tial is small. The sign of the contribution of the P-wave
potentials to the ﬁnal value of the PAPTR varies with
the chosen potential. Only a few of the P-wave poten-
tials used in this study were able to lead to values of the
PAPTR in agreement or close to its experimental one.
It should however be noted that for the study of impact
of the P-wave potential the included S-wave component
was that of the so called “full eﬀective model” which can
be observed, from left panel of Fig. (9), to lead to higher
values of PAPTR than some S-wave potentials extracted
from pionic atoms data. The impact of the density gradi-
ent term of the P-wave potentials is at the level of a few
percent and leads to lower and higher value of PAPTR
for the a stiﬀ and soft asy-EoS, respectively. Furthermore
the direction of the impact (increase vs. decrease) was
reavealed to be, during our investigation, dependent also
on the choice of the P-wave potential. It can be concluded
that for an accurate description of the experimental value
of PAPTR both the S and P-wave pion potentials need
to be precisely known from other sources.

A comparison of predictions of the full model with ex-
perimental rapidity and transverse momentum spectra of
pions [18] will be postponed until the end of next Section,
in order to be able to make use of the extracted strength,
from experimental data, of the isovector ∆(1232) poten-
tial.

We

conclude

this Section with a presentation,
in Fig. (10), of the time evolution of the average trans-
verse momenta of the three charge states of the pion dur-
ing HICs. Four cases have been selected for this study.
For the ﬁrst one the eﬀect of pion potentials is completely
neglected. The other three are obtained by successively
adding the following ingredients to the ﬁrst case: the S-
wave pion potential, non density-gradient terms of the
P-wave pion potential and the density gradient term of
the P-wave potential. Additions of each of these contri-
bution leads to important modiﬁcations of the average
pT of pions at earlier stages of the collision, particularly
during the high density phase. The impact of the S and
P-wave components of the potential are of comparable
magnitude, there is however a noticeable isospin depen-
dence for the former one. The inﬂuence of the gradi-
ent terms of the P-wave potentials on the ﬁnal values of
transverse momenta is smallest, at a few percent level. It
is however clear that the outcome of the full model is the
result of ﬁne (partial) cancellations of the eﬀects of all
the components of the pion potential, making the need
for their precise knowledge more transparent.

tical potential it is worth to rediscuss the impact of the
∆(1232) isovector potential on the PMR and stress the
diﬀerences with the conclusions of the initial investiga-
tion reported in Ref.
[11]. The analysis will be ex-
tended to include the AVPTR and also to a wider range
for the strength of isovector ∆(1232) potential. The lat-
ter quantity will be allowed both attractive and repulsive

strengths in the range [-2,3] in units of δ (see Eq. (3)
and the paragraph following it). The eﬀects due to the
eﬀective model for the S-wave pion potential and Batty-
1 parametrization for the P-wave one (with an energy
dependence as discussed in Section II B) have been in-
cluded. The results of this simulation are presented
in Fig. (11).

The impact of the strength of the isovector ∆(1232)
potential on the PMR is presented in the left-hand side
panel of Fig. (11) for diﬀerent values of the asy-EoS stiﬀ-
ness parameter x. The strong dependence of the PMR
on this quantity for all values of x, with the exception
of a narrow interval that encloses x = 1, is evident. The
sensitivity decreases however for attractive choices of the
strength Vv and becomes rather small in the neighbor-
hood of Vv = −2δ. As already noted at the begin-
ning of Section III, the small changes implemented to
the transport model, with respect to Ref. [11], lead to a
slightly lower value for PMR and somewhat modiﬁed de-
pendence on x, mostly due to the decrease of the strength
of the Coulomb interaction. This is most easily visible for
the a strength of the isovector ∆(1232) potential Vv=3δ.
For this case the current model leads to PMR values that
are largely independent of x, while the version of Ref. [11]
gives rise to increasing PMRs with increasing SE softness
allowing the description of the experimental FOPI value
for a very soft asy-EoS. Extrapolations of the presented
results suggest that the current model would be able to
describe the experimental PMR data for a stronger than
Vv=3δ isovector ∆(1232) potential and a soft SE, in addi-
tion to the cases evident from the left panel of Fig. (11).

The right-hand side panel of Fig. (11) presents the
dependence of the AVPTR on both the strength of the
isovector ∆(1232) potential and the SE stiﬀness param-

eter x. By ﬁxing the former it can be concluded that
the AVPTR is sensitive to the isovector part of the EoS.
The sensitivity to its stiﬀness is however considerably less
pronounced than for PMRs, amounting to at most 10%
between the very soft and very stiﬀ choices for x. This
feature is more clearly visible for repulsive values of Vv
and in particular for the choice commonly employed in
most transport models Vv=δ. For attractive Vv the sen-
sitivity to the SE decreases to about 5%, but for these
cases the theoretical AVPTR values tend to over-predict
the experimental one. With regard to the extraction of
constraints for the SE stiﬀness it should be noted that
experimental values for this observable are determined
with much higher accuracy than for PMR (2.5% versus
10%) which balances to a certain extent the disadvantage
of a lower sensitivity to the asy-EoS stiﬀness. The sensi-

tivity of the AVPTR to Vv mirrors almost perfectly the
behavior evidenced for the PMR. It reaches a maximum
for stiﬀ choices of the asy-EoS and becomes smaller for
soft ones, vanishing in the neighborhood of x = 1.

It is instructive to present the comparison theory ver-
sus experiment as χ2/dof plots for the observables of in-
terest that also exhibits the above discussed sensitivity
to the stiﬀness of the symmetry energy and strength of
the ∆(1232) isovector potential. This is achieved in the
left panel of Fig. (12) for the PMR. To facilitate the ex-
traction of information about the favored value of x (and
Vv) curves for the 68%, 95.5%, 99.3% and 99.994% con-

parameter, are plotted. They are labeled by the corre-
sponding value of χ2/dof. The conclusions of Ref. [11],

that can also be inferred from the left panel of Fig. (11),
with regard to suitability of the PMR for the extraction
of constraints for the density dependence of SE above sat-
uration are more transparent. Speciﬁcally, the extracted
value for x depends strongly on Vv and, furthermore, for
a repulsive isovector ∆(1232) potential the uncertainty
increases as a result of the lower sensitivity of PMR to
the asy-EoS stiﬀness.
In contrast, for the hypothetical
case of an attractive isovector ∆(1232) potential the stiﬀ-
ness of the SE can be more accurately determined and is
almost independent on the value of Vv.

The observed impass can be resolved by including in
the expression of χ2/dof of contributions due to AVPTR.
This claim is supported by the results presented in the
right-hand side plot of Fig. (12).
It is observed that
the range of allowed, at 1σ conﬁdence level, isovector
∆(1232) potential strength values Vv is signiﬁcantly nar-
rower, favoring a mildly repulsive one, as compared to the
case when only contribution due to PMR are included.
Similarly, the allowed range for the stiﬀness parameter x
is more constrained at 1σ level to x=-1.0+0.75
−1.5 . The cor-
responding value for the allowed slope parameter interval
is L=106+67
−34 MeV. The accuracy is comparable with the
one that can be achieved from elliptic ﬂow ratio con-
straints that make use of the FOPI-LAND experimental
data [21, 22, 63], but is a factor of 2-3 more imprecise
than what can be accomplished by using the most recent
ASYEOS Collaboration results for similar observables
[62]. The less than optimal accuracy when extracting the
value of L from pion related observables originates from
three main sources: ﬁrstly, the sensitivity of the PMR to

14

the SE stiﬀness decreases towards higher values of L; sec-
ondly, the experimental uncertainty on PMR amounts to
a rather large value, close to 10%; thirdly, the sensitivity
of AVPTR to the slope parameter L is not as pronounced
as for the PMR.

Each of these three sources of uncertainties can be re-
duced in the following manner: 1) choosing nuclei with
higher isospin asymmetry; 2) performing experimental
measurements at lower impact energies, closer of even
below the vacuum pion production threshold and 3) im-
proving experimental accuracy. All of these requirements
will be fulﬁlled by measurements that will be performed
in the very near future by the SAMURAI TPC collabo-
ration [64]. For the already existing FOPI experimental
data only the last source can be partially alleviated by
performing a reanalysis of the available data sets and
excluding from the spectra the regions of increased sys-
tematic uncertainties, as is for example the low-energy
part of the pion spectrum.

Before such an improved experimental result will be-
come available, it will be useful to attempt to estimate
the impact of such an eﬀort on the extracted constraints
for the slope parameter L and isovector ∆(1232) poten-
tial strength Vv. This exercise will also oﬀer indications
about the potential of the experimental programme put
forward by the SAMURAI TPC collaboration [64]. To
this end, we artiﬁcially decrease the uncertainties of the
experimental FOPI values for the PMR and PAPTR in
central 197Au+197Au collisions at an impact energy of
400 MeV/nucleon from 9.5% to 3% and from 2.5% to
1.5% respectively. The results are plotted in Fig. (13) for
the case when Batty-1 P-wave pion potential is used by
the double-dashed-double-dotted curve (labeled “Batty-
1 low exp err”). The case when the full magnitude of
the experimental uncertainties is considered is depicted
by the full curve (labeled “Batty-1”). The important
“improvement” of the experimental accuracy leads to an
increase of the accuracy of the extracted values for L
and Vv by fraction amounting to about 30-40% of the
old result. It can thus be concluded that a precise deter-
mination of the slope parameter from pion observables
will require a very careful choice of the system studied
and of the impact energy together with a signiﬁcant im-
provement of the experimental accuracy to values in the
few percent range.

The success of such a programme will only be war-
ranted if certain progress on the theoretical side will be
also achieved. To support this statement, we plot in
Fig. (13), the 1σ conﬁdence level of the theoretical ver-
sus experimental comparison of PMR+PAPTR for var-
ious choices of the pion P-wave potential. Results for
each of the parametrizations listed in Tab. (I) are pro-
vided. It can be seen that the minimum allowed value for
L varies rather strongly with the choice of the potential
between the limits L=61 MeV (x=0.0) and L=85 MeV
(x=-0.5). Furthermore, for all of the used P-wave po-
tentials the maximum value of L satisﬁes the constraint
L >150 MeV.

Taking into account all evidenced sources of uncer-
tainty we can deduce, from a comparison of the present
model and the available experimental FOPI data for
PMR and PAPTR, that at 68% CL the slope of the sym-
metry energy at saturation has to be stiﬀer than L=61
MeV irrespective of the strength of the ∆(1232) potential
or of details of the pion optical potential. This lower limit
is further decreased to roughly L=35 MeV and L=20
MeV to achieve a 95.5% and 99.3% CL result.
It can
be therefore concluded, with suﬃcient certainty, that the
density dependence of the symmetry energy is not soft.
The extraction of an upper limit with a similar conﬁdence
level will have to be postponed until more precise data
of a reaction more sensitive to the density dependence of
the SE will become available.

The present transport model favors, on average, when
the Batty-1 parametrization for the P-wave potential is
employed a rather soft repulsive ∆(1232) potential, with
Vv=0.5δ. Using this result, the charged pion rapidity
and transverse momentum spectra have been determined
and are plotted in Fig. (14) together with the FOPI
experimental result [18]. For this theory versus exper-
iment comparison the value of the stiﬀness parameter
has been set to x=-1, which is close to the average value
favored by the model in conjunction with the Batty-1 P-
wave pion potential (see Fig. (13)). The comparison is
performed for mid-central collisions of 197Au+197Au nu-
clei, the additional imposed kinematical constraints be-
ing 0< y/yP <1.75 and pT <0.33 GeV/c. It is observed
that both the rapidity and pT experimental spectra are
under-predicted by the model by fractions in the range
of 10%-20% particularly in the mid-rapidity and higher
than average pT regions. The high rapidity and high pT
tails of the spectra are generally in close agreement to
the data. As the π− and π+ multiplicities increase and
respectively decrease with the increase of asy-EoS stiﬀ-
ness the observed general under-prediction of experimen-
tal data for these two observable may be reduced by a ﬁne
adjustment of the isoscalar part of the mean-ﬁeld poten-
tial, in particular that of the rather uncertainly known
isoscalar ∆(1232) potential. The momentum dependence
of the diﬀerence theory versus experiment underlines the
need for an precise knowledge of the momentum depen-
dent part of the optical potentials the model relies upon.
The same experimental data set can be used to perform
a comparison theory vs. experiment for the transverse
momentum dependent PMR. The results are presented
in Fig. (15) for all ﬁve choices of the stiﬀness parame-
ter x used in this study. The general feature of all the
theoretical sets is that the slope of the transverse momen-
tum dependent PMR is mildly stiﬀer than the experimen-
tal one at low and average values of pT and moderately
softer at the high end part. As it will become evident
from Fig. (16) this observable is greatly inﬂuenced by
the S-wave pion potential and to a lesser extent also by
the P-wave one. An accurate knowledge of the momen-
tum dependent parts of the two components of the pion
optical potential is therefore mandatory for a successful

15

description of the pT dependent PMR. We remind the
reader that in this respect our approach has been rather
qualitative, due to the lack of needed knowledge in this
area. For the momentum dependent part of the S-wave
pion potential we have required a reproduction of the
empirical values of the eﬀective isoscalar scattering am-
plitude ¯bef f
that have been extracted from pion-nucleus
scattering experiments. In the case of the P-wave poten-
tial, the strength extracted from pionic atoms data have
been extrapolated to the energy of interest by mirroring
the momentum dependence of the theoretical potential
of Ref. [46]. It is worth reminding that the experimen-
tal data plotted in Fig. (15) do not include systematical
uncertainties and consequently the mild to moderate dif-
ferences between the experimental and theoretical slopes
of the pT dependent PMR may not be statistically sig-
niﬁcant. Besides these observations, it is evident that
the experimental data are qualitatively compatible with
values of the stiﬀness parameter x=0 and x=-1 and to
a lesser extent x=-2. On the other hand, soft choices of
the asy-EoS stiﬀness, x=1 and x=2, under-predict the
experimental values and will continue to do so also when
the systematical uncertainties of the experimental data,
which are of the order of 10%, will be taken into account.
The results presented in Ref. [5] have suggested that
PMRs are not sensitive to the slope parameter L of the
SE at saturation. It was consequently proposed that the
kinetic energy (or equivalently transverse momentum)
dependent PMR, particularly its high energy tail, should
be used in order to constraint L from experimental data.
The model employed in that study included a momentum
independent isovector S-wave pion potential but the P-
wave component was completely neglected. Motivated by
the upcoming data gathering campaign of the SAMURAI
TPC collaboration [64], which has among its objectives
the experimental measurement of pion emission in heavy-
ion collisions of impact energies in the neighborhood of
the vacuum threshold for pion production, we consider it
worthwhile to stress once more the importance of includ-
ing the pion potential with all its components and realis-
tic energy dependence in transport models that attempt
to describe such reactions.
Ignoring the impact of the
isovector ∆(1232) potential, we present in Fig. (16) the
impact of the pion potential for two values of the impact
energy, Tlab=250 MeV/nucleon (left panel) and Tlab=400
MeV/nucleon (right panel), in mid-central 197Au+197Au
collisions. The stiﬀness parameter has been set to x = 0.
For the higher impact energy case, the FOPI-LAND ex-
perimental result [18] is also shown for comparison.

Starting with the Tlab=400 MeV/nucleon case (right
panel of Fig. (16)), it is observed that the exclusion of
both the S and P-wave pion potential components leads
to signiﬁcant deviations of the model predictions from
the experimental data. This is most evident in the low
pT region, where the theoretical model over-predicts the
experimental data by a factor of four. In the region sur-
rounding the average pT value the discrepancy becomes
an under-prediction by a factor of two. Interestingly, the

FIG. 15: (Color online) Theoretical transverse momentum
PMR spectra in mid-central 197Au+197Au collisions at an
impact energy of 400 MeV/nucleon compared to its FOPI
Collaboration experimental value [18]. The eﬀective model
S-wave and the Batty-1 P-wave pion potentials have been ac-
counted for in the simulations. Results for ﬁve values of the
stiﬀness parameter x are plotted. Remarks made in the cap-
tion of Fig. (14) holds also for the case presented here.

slope of the experimental data is not reproduced by the
no pion potential version of the model even for the high-
est accessible pT values. The situation is considerably
improved with the inclusion of the S-wave pion poten-
tial, particularly in the large pT region where now both
the value and the slope of the transverse momentum de-

pendent PMR are reasonably close to the experimental
data. In the low pT region an overestimation of the exper-
imental data by a factor of two persists. This is resolved
by the inclusion of the P-wave pion potential (the Batty-
1 parametrization in this case), which suggests that the
low energy parts of the both S and P-wave potentials
are realistic enough. The diﬀerence between theoretical
and experimental results is however increased in the mid
and high pT regions. This results emphasizes once more
the importance of the energy dependent part of the pion
potential since for these regions the total pion potential
is the result of the subtraction of repulsive S-wave and
attractive P-wave contributions.

These observations are also valid for the case of an
impact energy of Tlab=250 MeV/nucleon (left panel of
Fig. (16)) with the important diﬀerence that the impact
of the pion potential on the PMR increases. In the mid
transverse momentum region, the inclusion of the S-wave
potential enhances the PMR by a factor of two, the sub-
sequent addition of the P-wave potential leads to a de-
crease by 20-30 % of this observable. The extraction of a
trustworthy narrow constraint for the allowed values for
L will thus only be possible with the accurate knowledge
and inclusion in the transport model of choice of both
components of the pion potential. The smaller diﬀer-
ences between these three cases at higher values for pT is
a direct consequence of the cancellation of the strengths
of the S and P-wave components of the pion potential
due to the particular assumed momentum dependence
(see Fig. (4)). As already mentioned, the assumptions
put forward in this study for this issue may not be accu-
rate enough for the purpose of the extraction of accurate
constraints for the high density dependence of the SE.

The present study has made possible to overcome one
of the stated shortcomings of the model of Ref. [11],
the omission of the pion optical potential. As has been
stressed on several occasions, the approach of the de-
scribed study is rather qualitative in view of the lack
of accurate knowledge of the pion potential for the en-
tire ranges of density and energy probed in intermediate
energy heavy-ion collisions. As a consequence, the ex-
tracted values for both the slope of the symmetry energy
at saturation L and the strength of the isovector ∆(1232)
potential in nuclear matter are plagued by rather sizable
uncertainties, comparable or even larger than the ones
induced by experimental inaccuracies. A possible solu-
tion to this issue will require identiﬁcation of heavy-ion
observables that present an enhanced sensitivity to the
strength of the pion potential and a supressed one to the
quantities of interest. In this context, heavy-ion experi-
mental data for nuclei with small isospin asymmetry may
prove valuable.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

A QMD type transport model applicable to heavy-
ion collisions with impact energies of a few hundred
MeV/nucleon that allows the conservation of the total
energy of the system during such reactions has been fur-
ther improved by including the eﬀects of the S and P-
wave components of the pion optical potential. This al-
lows theoretical computations of observables related to
the ﬁnal momenta of the emitted pions. Of these, the
ﬁnal average transverse momenta of charged pions and
their ratio (PAPTR) have been studied in detail. The
main result of this study is the proof of feasibility of us-

ing this observable in conjunction with the charged pion
multiplicity ratio (PMR) to extract constraints, from ex-
perimental data, for both the stiﬀness of the symmetry
energy and the strength of the isovector component of
the ∆(1232) potential in nuclear matter.

It has been shown that the energy conservation scenar-
ios introduced in a previous study have a signiﬁcant im-
pact on the ratios of average transverse momenta. Specif-
ically, in the case when the eﬀect of potential energies is
not taken into account in the energy conservation con-
straint appearing in the collision term of the transport
equations, the theoretical value of PAPTR is systemati-
cally overestimating the experimental one by about 20%.
Within the local energy conservation scenario (LEC) the
value of PATPR underestimates the experimental data
by a fraction in the range of 5-10%. Finally, requiring
the conservation of the total energy of the system (GEC
scenario) leads to an increase of the value of PAPTR such
that the experimental data are once again overestimated
by an amount in the range of 10-15%.

The S-wave component of the pion potential that has
been employed in this study takes into account theoret-
ical results concerning chiral symmetry restoration and
pion-nucleon scattering in dense nuclear matter that have
been previously validated by the experimental study of
properties of pionic atoms. An energy dependence of the
potential has been incorporated by using as guidance em-
pirical results about the behavior of the vacuum isoscalar
and isovector scattering pion-nucleon amplitudes away
from threshold and requiring an agreement with experi-
mental data on pion-nucleus scattering up to pion kinetic
energies of 300 MeV.

The P-wave pion optical potentials used in this work
have their origin in pionic atoms studies. Their extrapo-

lation to higher momenta must however be handled with
care, given the strong energy dependence of the ∆(1232)
width. To this end we have mirrored the energy depen-
dence of a theoretical model for the optical pion potential
derived within the framework of the delta-hole approxi-
mation. To be on par with theoretical models describing
pionic atoms properties, also the density gradient terms
of the potential have been implemented in the transport
model. They have been shown to have a non-negligible
impact on observables in the context of constraining the
density dependence of the symmetry energy.

The total impact of the S and P-wave components of
the pion potential on pion multiplicity ratio is found to
be moderate. However, by neglecting their contribution,
uncertainties that can amount to as much as 50 MeV
on the extracted value for the symmetry energy slope at
saturation L could be expected. The described model for
the pion optical potential leads to a good description of
experimental values for the average transverse momenta,
at 5% level, in mid-central 197Au+197Au at an impact
energy of 400 MeV/nucleons. The description of the ex-
perimental value of the ratio of average transverse mo-
menta of charged pions is of even better quality for cer-
tain choices of the P-wave optical potential parametriza-
tion.

The impact of the strength of the isovector ∆(1232)
potential on the pion multiplicity and average transverse
momentum ratios is investigated, conﬁrming the conclu-
sions of a previous study for the PMR and evidencing a
similar behaviour for the PAPTR. Using available FOPI
experimental data for these observables, it is shown that
constraints for both the slope L of the symmetry energy
at saturation and the strength of the isovector ∆(1232)
potential can be extracted from a two dimensional χ2 ﬁt.
The obtained values for these parameters are however
rather imprecise due to rather large uncertainties that
aﬀect the experimental data (multiplicity ratios) and in-
accurate knowledge of the pion optical potential for the
entire density and energy range probed in heavy-ion col-
lisions.

The presently available experimental data favor a value

18

of the slope parameter L larger than 60 MeV, at 1σ conﬁ-
dence level, implying the claim that the symmetry energy
is not soft. The allowed upper limit is however a very
stiﬀ one, exceeding the value L=150 MeV for any choice
of the P-wave pion potential. Additionally, the allowed
value for the isovector ∆(1232) potential strength is, on
average, somewhat weaker, by about 25%, than the usual
choice employed in transport models. For the favored
values for these two parameters, the transport model al-
lows a good description of available FOPI experimental
rapidity and transverse momentum multiplicity spectra
of charged pions in mid-central 197Au+197Au collisions
at an impact energy of 400 MeV/nucleon.

It has also been shown that by increasing the precission
of the experimental measurements the uncertainties of
the extracted contraints for the stiﬀness of the symmetry
energy can be signiﬁcantly reduced. The situation can
be further improved by studying experimentally systems
with a higher isospin asymmetry at impact energies closer
to the vacuum pion production threshold than previously
accomplished. For such a programme to be succesful the
knowledge of the pion potential at densities higher than
probed in pionic atoms experiments and its energy depen-
dence will have to be advanced. This is necessary also
because the impact of the pion optical potential increases
as the collision energy is decreased. In this context, ex-
perimental measurements of reactions involving isospin
symmetric heavy-nuclei may prove helpful.
