March 16, 2016

Abstract

We show that the Ax-Schanuel theorem can be easily generalised to
linear diﬀerential equations (with constant coeﬃcients) of any order.
Using the analysis of the exponential diﬀerential equation by J. Kirby
([Kir06]) and C. Crampin ([Cra06]) we give a complete axiomatisation
of the ﬁrst order theories of linear diﬀerential equations and show that
the generalised Ax-Schanuel inequalities are adequate for them.

Introduction

In [Lan66] Serge Lang mentions that Stephen Schanuel has conjectured that
for any Q-linearly independent complex numbers z1, . . . , zn one has

tr. deg.Q Q(z1, . . . , zn, ez1, . . . , ezn) ≥ n.

(1.1)

This is now known as Schanuel’s conjecture. It generalises many results

and conjectures in transcendental number theory and is widely open.

Schanuel’s conjecture (and its real version) is closely related to the model
theory of the complex (real) exponential ﬁeld Cexp = (C; +, ·, exp) (respec-
tively, Rexp = (R; +, ·, exp), see [MW96]). Most notably, Boris Zilber noticed
that the inequality (1.1) states the positivity of a predimension in the sense
of Hrushovski. More precisely, Schanuel’s conjecture is equivalent to the
following statement: for any z1, . . . , zn ∈ C the inequality

δ(z) = tr. deg.Q Q(z, exp(z)) − l. dimQ(z) ≥ 0

(1.2)

holds, where tr. deg. and l. dim stand for transcendence degree and linear
dimension respectively. Here δ satisﬁes the submodularity law which allows
one to carry out a Hrushovski construction. In this way B. Zilber constructed
pseudo-exponentiation on algebraically closed ﬁelds of characteristic zero. He
proved that there is a unique model of that (not ﬁrst-order) theory in each
uncountable cardinality and conjectured that the model of cardinality 2ℵ0
is isomorphic to Cexp. Since (1.2) holds for pseudo-exponentiation (it is
included in the axiomatisation given by Zilber), Zilber’s conjecture implies
Schanuel’s conjecture. For details on pseudo-exponentiation see [Zil04, Zil05,
Zil02, Zil13].

Though Schanuel’s conjecture seems to be out of reach of modern methods
in mathematics, James Ax proved its diﬀerential analogue in 1971 ([Ax71]).
It is now known as the Ax-Schanuel theorem or inequality.

Theorem 1.1 (Ax-Schanuel). Let K = (K; +, ·, D) be a diﬀerential ﬁeld with
ﬁeld of constants C. If (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn) are non-constant solutions to the
exponential diﬀerential equation D y = y D x then

tr. deg.C C(x, y) − l. dimQ(x/C) ≥ 1,

(1.3)

where l. dimQ(x/C) is the dimension of the Q-span of x1, . . . , xn in the quo-
tient vector space K/C.

Here again we have a predimension inequality, which will be part of the
ﬁrst order theory of the reduct KExp = (K; +, ·, Exp) of K where Exp is a bi-
nary predicate for the set of solutions of the exponential diﬀerential equation.
Therefore a natural question arises: if one carries out a Hrushovski construc-
tion with this predimension and class of reducts, will one end up with a
similar reduct of a diﬀerentially closed ﬁeld (more precisely, this should be
the unique countable saturated model of the theory TExp = Th(FExp) where
FExp is the reduct of a diﬀerentially closed ﬁeld F )? In other words we can
ask whether a Hrushovski construction will yield the theory TExp. Boris Zil-
ber calls predimensions with this property adequate. Thus the question is
whether the Ax-Schanuel inequality is adequate.

Cecily Crampin pursued this goal in her PhD thesis [Cra06] and showed
that Ax-Schanuel is adequate. She gave an axiomatisation of the theory TExp
analogous to pseudo-exponentiation. Jonathan Kirby considered the same
problem in a much more general context. He studied exponential diﬀerential
equations for semiabelian varieties, observed that Ax-Schanuel holds in this
setting too and proved that it is adequate along with giving an axiomatisation
of the complete theory of the reducts (see [Kir06]). The axiomatisation is
again very similar to pseudo-exponentiation. An important property that

2

shows adequacy of Ax-Schanuel is the strong existential closedness which
means that models of TExp are existentially closed in strong extensions. More
details on this, in particular an axiomatisation of TExp, will be presented in
Section 2.

Once this is done, one naturally asks the question of whether something
similar can be done for other diﬀerential equations. In other words, one wants
to ﬁnd adequate predimension inequalities for diﬀerential equations. In this
paper we show that this can be done for any linear diﬀerential equations with
constant coeﬃcients (the exponential diﬀerential equation being a special
case of it).

We formulate our main results below. For a diﬀerential ﬁeld K and a non-
constant element x ∈ K deﬁne a derivation ∂x : K → K by ∂x = (D x)−1 · D.
Then consider the diﬀerential equation

x y + cn−1∂n−1

x

(D x)2n−1(cid:2)∂n

y + . . . + c1∂xy + c0y(cid:3) = 0,

(*)

where the coeﬃcients are constants with c0 6= 0. The role of the fac-
tor (D x)2n−1 is that it makes the left hand side of (*) into a diﬀerential
polynomial. Let λ1, . . . , λn be the roots of the characteristic polynomial

p(λ) = λn +P0≤i<n ciλi. Then the Ax-Schanuel theorem for (*) is as follows.

Theorem 3.4. Let (xi, yi), i = 1, . . . , m, be non-constant solutions to the
equation (*) in a diﬀerential ﬁeld K such that yi, ∂xiyi, . . . , ∂n−1
xi yi are linearly
independent over C for every i. Then

tr. deg.C C(x, y, ∂xy, . . . , ∂n−1

y) ≥ l. dimQ(λ1x, . . . , λnx/C) + 1,

(**)

where ∂j

xy := (∂j

x1y1, . . . , ∂j

xmym).

Our problem is to axiomatise the complete theory of the equation (*).
As the inequality (**) suggests it will be natural to work with reducts of
diﬀerential ﬁelds with an (n + 1)-ary relation En(x, y, ∂xy, . . . , ∂n−1
y). Then
(**) can be written in a ﬁrst-order way. For the complete axiomatisation we
will need an important axiom scheme called Existential Closedness. For a
structure F in our language it can be formulated as follows (for the deﬁnition
of En-Exp-rotundity see section 4).

x

(EC’) For each En-Exp-rotund variety V ⊆ F m(n+1) the intersection V (F )∩

Em

n (F ) is non-empty.

We will see that this axiom scheme along with the inequality (**) and
some basic axioms (which reveal the relationship between En and Exp) will

3

axiomatise the ﬁrst order theory TEn of reducts of diﬀerentially closed ﬁelds
in the corresponding language.

Our results will rely heavily on the aforementioned analysis of the equa-
tion D y = y D x. In particular, we use the Ax-Schanuel theorem to prove
Theorem 3.4. Then we use the axiomatisation of TExp to obtain an axioma-
tisation of TEn. In fact the exponential diﬀerential equation can be deﬁned
in our reducts which means that one can simply translates the axioms of
TExp to obtain an axiomatisation of TEn. However we give an axiomatisation
based on the predimension inequality (**) and show the adequacy of that
predimension, which means that the En-reduct of a countable saturated dif-
ferentially closed ﬁeld can be constructed by a Hrushovski construction with
that predimension.

Let us also note that the problem of ﬁnding adequate predimension in-
equalities proved to be closely related to the problem of deﬁnability of the
derivation of our diﬀerential ﬁeld in its reducts. We have studied this ques-
tion in [Asl16].
In particular, the results of the current paper, with the
analysis carried out in [Asl16], will show that D is not deﬁnable from linear
diﬀerential equations.

2 The exponential diﬀerential equation

In this section we give an axiomatisation of the theory of the exponential
diﬀerential equation. We will work in the language LExp = {+, ·, 0, 1, Exp}
where Exp is a binary predicate which will be interpreted in a diﬀerential
ﬁeld K = (K; +, ·, 0, 1, D) as the set {(x, y) ∈ K 2 : D y = y D x}. In this
case the reduct of K to the language LExp will be denoted by KExp. For a
diﬀerentially closed ﬁeld K we denote the complete ﬁrst-order theory of KExp
by TExp. Also an LExp-structure which happens to be a ﬁeld will be called
an Exp-ﬁeld.

As we already mentioned, an axiomatisation of TExp is given by Kirby
[Kir06] and Crampin [Cra06] (Kirby’s work is much more general, he stud-
ies exponential diﬀerential equations of semiabelian varieties). The original
idea of such an axiomatisation is due to Zilber in the context of pseudo-
exponentiation [Zil04]. We refer the reader to [Kir06, Kir09, Zil04, Cra06]
for details and proofs of the results presented in this section.

Theorem 2.2 (Ax-Schanuel - version 2). Let V ⊆ Gn(K) be an algebraic
variety deﬁned over C with dim(V ) ≤ n. If (x, y) ∈ V (K) ∩ Expn(K) then
there is a proper algebraic subgroup H of Gn

If V is a variety as above and V (K) ∩ Expn(K) 6= ∅ then we say V has an
exponential point. The Ax-Schanuel theorem can be thought of as a necessary
condition for a variety to have an exponential point. We will shortly present
a suﬃcient condition for this.
It will be the existential closedness axiom
scheme. But for now we consider some basic axioms for an Exp-ﬁeld FExp.

(A1) F is an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic 0.

(A2) C := {c ∈ F : F |= Exp(c, 1)} is a algebraically closed subﬁeld of F .

(A3) Exp(F ) = {(x, y) ∈ F 2 : Exp(x, y)} is a subgroup of G1(F ) containing

G1(C).

(A4) The ﬁbres of Exp in Ga(F ) and Gm(F ) are cosets of the subgroups

Ga(C) and Gm(C) respectively.

(SC) For any xi, yi ∈ F,

i = 1, . . . , n,

i=1 Exp(xi, yi) and
tr. deg.C C(x, y) ≤ n then there are integers m1, . . . , mn, not all of
them zero, such that m1x1 + . . . + mnxn ∈ C.

if FExp |= Vn

These axioms basically constitute the universal part of TExp with the

exception that ACF0 is not universal.

Note that (SC) above can be given by an axiom scheme. A compactness
argument gives a bound on the integers mi which makes it possible to write
(SC) as a set of universal sentences.

Now we turn to existential closedness. For a k × n matrix M of integers
we deﬁne [M] : Gn(F ) → Gk(F ) to be the map given by [M] : (x, y) 7→
(u1, . . . , uk, v1, . . . , vk) where

ui =

Deﬁnition 2.3. An irreducible variety V ⊆ Gn(F ) is rotund if for any
1 ≤ k ≤ n and any k × n matrix M of integers dim[M](V ) ≥ rank M. If for
any non-zero M the stronger inequality dim[M](V ) ≥ rank M + 1 holds then
we say V is strongly rotund.

The deﬁnition of rotundity is originally due to Zilber though he initially
used the word normal for these varieties ([Zil04]). The term rotund was
coined by Jonathan Kirby in [Kir09].

Strong rotundity ﬁts with the Ax-Schanuel inequality in the sense that it
is a suﬃcient condition for a variety deﬁned over C to contain a non-constant
exponential point. More precisely, if F is diﬀerentially closed and V ⊆ Gn(F )
is a strongly rotund variety deﬁned over the constants then the intersection
V (F ) ∩ Expn(F ) contains a non-constant point.

Nevertheless, the existential closedness axiom we will use for the axioma-
tisation of TExp is slightly diﬀerent. One needs to consider varieties that are
not necessarily deﬁned over C.

The existential closedness property for an Exp-ﬁeld FExp is as follows.

(EC) For each rotund variety V ⊆ Gn(F ) the intersection V (F ) ∩ Expn(F )

is non-empty.

As noted above V is not necessarily deﬁned over C and the point in the
intersection may be constant.

Rotundity of a variety is a deﬁnable property. This allows one to axioma-
tise the above statement by a ﬁrst-order axiom scheme. Reducts of diﬀeren-
tially closed ﬁelds satisfy (EC) and it gives a complete theory together with
the axioms mentioned above.

6

Theorem 2.4 ([Kir06]). The theory TExp is axiomatised by the following
axioms and axiom schemes: (A1)-(A4), (SC), (EC).

We also deﬁne free varieties ([Kir06, Zil04]) and present a result from
[Kir06] below. Although this is not essential for the current paper, we will
use it to establish a similar fact for linear diﬀerential equations of higher order
(Section 5) which gives us a better understanding of the general picture.

Deﬁnition 2.5. An irreducible variety V ⊆ Gn(K) is Exp-free if it does not
have a generic point (a, b) for which

for some integers mi and ki.

X miai ∈ C or Y yki

i ∈ C

Note that this notion is called absolute freeness in [Kir06].

Proposition 2.6 ([Kir06]). Let V be an Exp-free variety deﬁned over C. If
V has a generic (over C) exponential point then it is strongly rotund.

Finally let us make an easy observation which will be useful later.

Lemma 2.7. Let K be a diﬀerentially closed ﬁeld. If V ⊆ Gn(K) is Exp-
rotund then for any constant c ∈ C × there is a point (a, b) ∈ V (K) such that
KExp |= Exp(cai, bi) for all i.

Proof. Let L : K 2n → K 2n be the map (x, y) 7→ (cx, y). It is very easy to
check that V ′ := L(V ) is Zariski closed and rotund. Therefore there is a
point (u, v) ∈ V ′(K) ∩ Expn(K). If ai = c−1ui, bi = vi then (a, b) ∈ V (K)
and Exp(cai, bi) holds.

3 Higher order linear diﬀerential equations

In this section we will use some facts and notions from the theory of abstract
linear diﬀerential equations in diﬀerential ﬁelds (see [MMP96], chapter 2,
section 4).

Let us start with a motivating example which will make it clear which
diﬀerential equations we should consider. If x(t) and y(t) are complex mero-
morphic functions with y(t) = exp(x(t)) then they satisfy the diﬀerential
equation d
dt x(t). Since we are interested in non-constant solu-
tions, this equation can be written as dy
= y. Now if we replace d
dt
with D, we will obtain the abstract exponential diﬀerential equation D y

dt y(t) = y(t) · d

dx =

d

x

D x = y.

7

Here we could also argue as follows. In the diﬀerential equation dy
dx = y re-
place diﬀerentiation with respect to x, that is, d
D x = y.
If x ∈ K is a non-constant element then ∂x = 1
D x · D is a derivation of K
and the exponential diﬀerential equation can be written as ∂x(y) = y. Here
∂x can be thought of as abstract diﬀerentiation with respect to x.

D x · D to get D y

dx with 1

Now we want to generalise this to higher order linear diﬀerential equations

with constant coeﬃcients. Consider the equation

dny
dxn + cn−1

dn−1y
dxn−1 + . . . + c1

dy
dx

+ c0y = 0.

(3.4)

Its solutions are linear combinations of exponential functions. We want
to form the corresponding abstract diﬀerential equations whose solutions will
be analogues of those combinations. As above we replace d
dx by ∂x to obtain
the equation

x y + cn−1∂n−1
∂n

x

y + . . . + c1∂xy + c0y = 0.

The left hand side of this equation is a diﬀerential rational function with
denominator (D x)2n−1. We multiply through by this factor to make the
left hand side into a polynomial. It will also allow us to deﬁne the ﬁeld of
constants. Thus we consider the abstract diﬀerential equation

y + . . . + c1∂xy + c0y(cid:3) = 0

(3.5)

∆(x, y) := (D x)2n−1(cid:2)∂n

x y + cn−1∂n−1

x

in a diﬀerential ﬁeld K. The coeﬃcients are supposed to be constants.

Note that ∂i

x above is the i-th iterate of the map ∂x : K → K. The
notation ∂x may misleadingly suggest that x is ﬁxed in the equation (3.5)
which is not the case. It should be considered as a two-variable equation. We
prefer this way of writing our equation since otherwise it would be cumber-
some. Note however that ∆(x, y) is not linear as a two-variable diﬀerential
polynomial, it is linear with respect to y only. We will assume that c0 6= 0 in
order to avoid any possible degeneracies (like D y = 0).

Observe that by introducing new variables z0, . . . , zn we can write (3.5)

as the following system of equations

zn + cn−1zn−1 + . . . + c1z1 + c0z0 = 0,
z0 = y,
D zi = zi+1 D x, i = 0, . . . , n − 1.

(3.6)




Note however that (3.5) and (3.6) are equivalent only for a non-constant
x. If x is constant then any y satisﬁes the former equality while only y = 0
satisﬁes the latter. This diﬀerence is not essential in this section since we

8

will anyway deal only with non-constant x’s. But it is convenient to work
with (3.6) starting from the next section.

Let p(λ) = λn + cn−1λn−1 + . . . + c0 be the characteristic polynomial of
(3.5). Let λ1, . . . , λn be its roots and let µ1, . . . , µk be its diﬀerent roots with
multiplicities n1, . . . , nk respectively. Since we have assumed c0 is non-zero,
λi’s are non-zero either.

Now we establish some auxiliary results which will be used in the proof
of the Ax-Schanuel theorem for the equation (3.5). Since it is a universal
statement, we can assume without loss of generality that K is diﬀerentially
closed. This is not very important but makes our arguments easier as we do
not have to worry about the existence of solutions of diﬀerential equations.

Lemma 3.1. Let x be a non-constant element of K and let yi ∈ K \ {0} be
i=1{yi, xyi, . . . , xni−1yi} forms

such that ∂xyi = µiyi for i = 1, . . . , k. Then Sk

a fundamental system of solutions to ∆(x, y) = 0.

Though the proof is very similar to that in the complex setting (see, for

example, [BR78]), we nevertheless present it here for completeness.

Proof. Since x is non-constant, the equation (3.5) can be written as p(∂x)y =
0. The operator p(∂x) can be factored as

k

It is easy to see that for any 0 ≤ l < ni

p(∂x) =

(∂x − µi)ni.

Yi=1

(∂x − µi)ni(xlyi) = 0.

Hence we have p(∂x)(xlyi) = 0 and thus we have n solutions to ∆(x, y) = 0.
Now we prove they are linearly independent.

Clearly

q(∂x) = (∂x − µi)tYs6=i
q(∂x)(xjyr) =(0, if r 6= i or j < t,

Now applying q(∂x) to (3.7) we get ait = 0, a contradiction.

If y1, . . . , yk are as in Lemma 3.1, then for any non-zero constants aij the
i=1{ai0yi, ai1xyi, . . . , ai,ni−1xni−1yi} is a fundamental system of solutions
to our equation. This kind of fundamental systems will be called canonical.
There is a unique such system up to multiplication by constants. Note also
that we will treat canonical fundamental systems as ordered tuples, rather
than as sets. Thus if we say v1, . . . , vn is a canonical fundamental system,
then we mean that the ﬁrst n1 elements coincide (up to constants) with
y1, xy1, . . . , xn1−1y1 respectively, and so on. Of course we assume a certain
ordering µ1, . . . , µk of diﬀerent eigenvalues is ﬁxed.

Deﬁnition 3.2. Given a non-constant x ∈ K let v1, . . . , vn be a canonical
fundamental system and let y ∈ K be such that ∆(x, y) = 0. Then y (or the

pair (x, y)) is said to be a proper solution if y = P aivi with ai ∈ C ×, that

is, if y is not in the linear span of a proper subset of {v1, . . . , vn}.

A solution is proper if and only if it does not satisfy a linear diﬀerential

equation of lower order.

It is also worth mentioning that when p(λ) does not have multiple roots,

Now we are ready to prove the Ax-Schanuel inequality for (3.5).

decrease and we will be reduced to the same inequality for a smaller n.
Note also that the case n = 1 is exactly Ax’s theorem for the exponential
diﬀerential equation.

Proof of Theorem 3.4. For each i let vij ∈ K ×, j = 1, . . . , n be a canonical
fundamental system of solutions to ∆(xi, y) = 0. Then for every i the C-

≥ l. dimQ(µ1x, . . . , µkx/C) + 1
= l. dimQ(λ1x, . . . , λnx/C) + 1

where vj is the tuple (v1j, v2j, . . . , vmj). The inequality follows from Ax’s
theorem applied to the tuple (µ1x, . . . , µkx).

4 The complete theory

Having established a predimension inequality (see Section 6) for higher or-
der linear diﬀerential equations, we want to ﬁnd an appropriate existential
closedness property and thus give an axiomatisation of the complete theory
of the corresponding reducts.

First let us see which language we should work in. An obvious option
would be simply taking a binary predicate for the solutions of the equation
(3.5). But this will not work since the inequality (3.8) cannot be written

11

as a ﬁrst order statement (axiom scheme) in this language. This is because
derivatives of yi’s are involved in (3.8). Therefore we need to take a predicate
of higher arity which will have variables for the derivatives of y’s as well.
Thus we will work in the language LEn = {+, ·, En, 0, 1, λ1, . . . , λn} where
λ1, . . . , λn are constant symbols for the roots of the characteristic polynomial
and En(x, z0, z1, . . . , zn−1) is an (n + 1)-ary predicate. It will be interpreted
in a diﬀerential ﬁeld K as the set

((x, z) ∈ K n+1 : ∃zn"zn +

n−1

Xi=0

cizi = 0 ∧

D zi = zi+1 D x#) .

n−1

^i=0

Note that since λ1, . . . , λn are in the language, the elements c0, . . . , cn−1 are
∅-deﬁnable. By an En-ﬁeld we mean a structure in the language LEn which
is a ﬁeld. The theory of reducts of diﬀerentially closed ﬁelds to this language
will be denoted by TEn. Also the ﬁeld of constants can be deﬁned as C =
{c : En(c, 1, 0, . . . , 0)}.

Observe that Exp can be deﬁned in an En-reduct of a diﬀerential ﬁeld.

Indeed, it is obvious that

K |= Exp(λix, y) ↔ En(x, y, λiy, . . . , λn−1

i

y)

for any i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. In fact Exp and En are interdeﬁnable. So we can
just translate the axiomatisation for the exponential diﬀerential equation
to the language LEn and get an axiomatisation of TEn. However we want
an axiomatisation based on the Ax-Schanuel inequality proved in Section
3. In other words we want to prove that (3.8) is an adequate predimension
inequality.

Notation. If ∂xyi = µiyi then let gijl(X) be the algebraic polynomial (over
Q(µi)) for which ∂l
i. Also denote

x(xjyi) = gijl(x)yi. In particular gi0l = µl

Ni := 1 +Pj<i nj.

Now we formulate a number of axioms and axiom schemes for an LEn-

structure FEn.

(A1’) F is an algebraically closed ﬁeld.

(A2’) The set C := {c ∈ F : FEn |= En(c, 1, 0, . . . , 0)} is an algebraically
closed subﬁeld of F and λ1, . . . , λn are non-zero elements of C satisfying
the appropriate algebraic relations. In particular λNi = λNi+1 = . . . =
λNi+ni−1 =: µi for every i.

12

(A3’) Let Exp(x, y) be the relation deﬁned by En(λ−1

y).
Then En(x, z0, . . . , zn−1) holds if and only if there are y1, . . . , yk ∈ F ×
with Exp(µix, yi) and elements aij ∈ C such that

1 x, y, λ1y, . . . , λn−1

1

zl =

k

ni−1

Xi=1

Xj=0

aijgijl(x)yi,

for l = 0, . . . , n − 1.

(A4’) Exp(F ) = {(x, y) ∈ F 2 : Exp(x, y)} is a subgroup of G1(F ) containing

G1(C).

(A5’) The ﬁbres of Exp in Ga(F ) and Gm(F ) are cosets of the subgroups

Ga(C) and Gm(C) respectively.

(SC’) Let xi, zij ∈ F \ C, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 0 ≤ j < n, be such that zi0, . . . , zi,n−1

are linearly independent over C and

FEn |=^i

En(xi, zi0, . . . , zi,n−1).

Then for each 1 ≤ d ≤ mn if l. dimQ(λ1x, . . . , λnx/C) ≥ d then

tr. deg.C C(x, z0, z1, . . . , zn−1) ≥ d + 1.

Note that in order to verify that the linear dimension in (SC’) is at least
d we can just consider linear combinations with integer coeﬃcients. A com-
pactness argument gives a bound on those integer coeﬃcients and therefore
(SC’) can be written as a ﬁrst-order axiom scheme.

Lemma 4.1. Let FEn be a model of (A1’)-(A5’),(SC’). Then the relation
Exp(x, y) satisﬁes (SC).

Proof. Let x1, . . . , xm ∈ F be Q-linearly independent modulo C. Then so are
µ1x1, . . . , µ1xm. Denote µsxi =: um(s−1)+i for i = 1, . . . , m, s = 1, . . . , k. If
l. dimQ(u1, . . . , umk/C) = d ≥ m then assume without loss of generality that
u1, . . . , ud are linearly independent over the rationals modulo C. Let vi ∈ F
be such that FEn |= Exp(ui, vi). Then (SC’) implies that

tr. deg.C C(x1, . . . , xm, v1, . . . , vmk) ≥ d + 1.

For each i > d there are integers mi, mi1, . . . , mid such that miui + mi1u1 +
. . . + midud = c ∈ C.

13

Denote v = vmi

. By (A4’) we have Exp(c, v). But also Exp(c, 1)
holds and using (A5’) we deduce that v ∈ C. Hence v1, . . . , vd, vi are alge-
braically dependent over C. Therefore

i Qd

j=1 vmij

j

tr. deg.C C(x, v1, . . . , vd) ≥ d + 1.

Now we can easily deduce that tr. deg.C C(x, v1, . . . , vm) ≥ m + 1 and we are
done.

Notation. Let prj : K m(n+1) → K 2m be deﬁned as

prj : (x, v0, . . . , vn−1) 7→ (x, vj),

where vj = (v1j, . . . , vmj).

Also we will denote the set {(x, z0, . . . , zn−1) ∈ F m(n+1) : FEn |=Vm

n (F ) where zi = (zi0, . . . , zi,n−1).

by Em

i=1 En(xi, zi)}

Deﬁnition 4.2. An irreducible variety V ⊆ K m(n+1) is called En-Exp-rotund
if V1 := pr1(V ) ⊆ Gm(K) is Exp-rotund and it has the following property:

(x, y) ∈ V1 =⇒ (x, y, µ1y, . . . , µn−1

1

y) ∈ V.

(4.9)

All the results below will remain true if we replace µ1 in (4.9) by any µi.

As Exp-rotundity is a deﬁnable property, so is En-Exp-rotundity.

Now we formulate the existential closedness property for an En-ﬁeld FEn.

(EC’) For each En-Exp-rotund variety V ⊆ F m(n+1) the intersection V (F )∩

Em

n (F ) is non-empty.

This statement can be given by a ﬁrst-order axiom scheme for En-Exp-

rotundity is a ﬁrst-order property.

Lemma 4.3. If K is a diﬀerentially closed ﬁeld then KEn satisﬁes (EC’).

Proof. Let V ⊆ K m(n+1) be an En-Exp-rotund variety. Then V1 = pr1(V )
is an Exp-rotund variety. So by Theorem 2.4 and Lemma 2.7 there is a
point (x, y) ∈ V1 such that KEn |= Exp(µ1xi, yi) for each i = 1, . . . , m. By
deﬁnition we have

(x, y, µ1y, . . . , µn−1

1

y) ∈ V.

It is also clear that

and we are done.

KEn |= En(x, y, µ1y, . . . , µn−1

1

y)

14

Lemma 4.4. If FEn satisﬁes (A1’)-(A5’), (SC’), (EC’) then Exp(x, y) sat-
isﬁes (EC).

Proof. Suppose W ⊆ Gm(F ) is an Exp-rotund variety deﬁned over a set
A ⊆ F . Let F ⊇ F be a saturated algebraically closed ﬁeld and pick
(a, b) ∈ F2n a generic point of W . Let V ⊆ F m(n+1) be the variety for
which (µ−1
b) is a generic point (V is deﬁned over Aµ1).
Then V is En-Exp-rotund and hence V (F ) ∩ Em
n (F ) 6= ∅. By our construc-
tion of V we also know that a point in that intersection must be of the form
(µ−1
y). Then (x, y) ∈ W and by (A3’) FEn |= Exp(x, y).
So W (F ) ∩ Expn(F ) 6= ∅.

1 x, y, µ1y, . . . , µn−1

1

1 a, b, µ1b, . . . , µn−1

Finally we can deduce that the given axioms form a complete theory.

Theorem 4.5. The axioms and axiom schemes (A1’)-(A5’), (SC’), (EC’)
axiomatise the complete theory TEn.

Proof. Indeed, Lemmas 4.1, 4.3 and 4.4 show that an LEn-structure FEn
satisﬁes (A1’)-(A5’), (SC’), and (EC’) if and only if the relation Exp(x, y)
satisﬁes the axioms (A1)-(A4), (SC), and (EC). The latter collection of ax-
ioms axiomatises the theory TExp by Theorem 2.4. Now the desired result
follows as the relations Exp and En are interdeﬁnable due to (A3’).

5 Rotundity and freeness

Though (EC’) is an appropriate existential closedness property for En-ﬁelds,
our deﬁnition of En-Exp-rotundity is not that natural. Indeed, the inequality
given by (SC’) is not reﬂected in it and also the notion of En-Exp-rotundity is
far from being a necessary condition for a variety to intersect En. As we saw,
En-Exp-rotund varieties have a very special En-point, which is essentially
(made of) an exponential point. For these reasons we deﬁne another notion
of rotundity (and strong rotundity) which will be more intuitive and natural
(that deﬁnition will not be as simple as Deﬁnition 4.2 though). We will see
in particular that strongly rotund varieties will contain proper En-points.

As before, for zij, i = 1, . . . , m, j = 0, . . . , n−1, denote zi = (zi0, . . . , zi,n−1)

and zj = (z1j, . . . , zmj). Deﬁne the map

˜L : K m(n+1) → K m(n+1)

by

˜L : (x, z0, . . . , zn−1) 7→ (x, L1

x1(z1), . . . , Ln

xm(zm)).

x1(z1), . . . , L1

xm(zm), . . . , Ln

15

Let ˜H be its inverse map. Recall that for 1 ≤ i ≤ k we denoted Ni =

1 +Pj<i nj. Deﬁne maps R : F m(n+1) → F m(k+1) and ˜R : F m(n+1) → F 2km

as follows:

R : (x, v1, . . . , vn) 7→ (x, vN1, . . . , vNk ).

˜R : (x, v1, . . . , vn) 7→ (µ1x, . . . , µkx, vN1, . . . , vNk).

Deﬁnition 5.1. An irreducible variety V ⊆ F m(n+1) is called (strongly) En-
rotund if V ′ := ˜R ◦ ˜L(V ) ⊆ Gkm(F ) is (strongly) Exp-rotund and V ′′ :=
R( ˜L(V )) satisﬁes the following property:

(x, y1, . . . , yk) ∈ V ′′ ⇒ ˜H(x, y1, xy1, . . . , xn1−1y1, . . . , yk, xyk, . . . , xnk−1yk) ∈ V.

One can use this notion of rotundity to formulate existential closedness
(replacing En-Exp-rotundity in (EC’) by En-rotundity). It is not diﬃcult to
check that the results of the previous section will still be valid. The following
result shows that this notion of rotundity ﬁts better with our diﬀerential
equation.

Proposition 5.2. Let K be a diﬀerentially closed ﬁeld. If V ⊆ K m(n+1) is a
strongly En-rotund variety deﬁned over C then V (K) has a proper En-point.

Proof. Indeed strong Exp-rotundity of V ′ implies that it has a non-constant
Exp-point. This point obviously gives rise to a proper En-point on V .

One can show that strong En-rotundity is a necessary condition for “free”
varieties to have a generic proper En-point. We give precise deﬁnitions below.
Recall that µ1, . . . , µk are the diﬀerent eigenvalues of our diﬀerential equa-
tion. For simplicity we assume in the rest of this section that these are lin-
early independent over Q. Otherwise we would have to take a basis and thus
introduce new notations which is not desirable.

Deﬁnition 5.3. An irreducible variety V ⊆ F m(n+1) is called En-free if
V ′ := ˜R ◦ ˜L(V ) ⊆ Gkm(F ) is Exp-free.

Note that if we do not require µ1, . . . , µk to be linearly independent over
Q then the above deﬁnition would not make sense. Of course in that case
we could just change the deﬁnition of the map R appropriately and get the
same notion of freeness. The following result follows from Proposition 2.6
and some obvious observations on generic points. It can also be proven using
Theorem 3.4.

Proposition 5.4. Suppose V ⊆ F m(n+1) is an irreducible and free variety
deﬁned over C. If V has a generic (over C) En-point then it must be strongly
En-rotund.

6 Predimension

Following [Kir06], we denote by T 0
Exp the LExp-theory given by the axioms
(A1)-(A4), (SC). Similarly, T 0
En is the LEn-theory consisting of the axioms
(A1’)-(A5’), (SC’). The results of Section 4 show that T 0
En (as well as
TExp and TEn) are essentially the same theory given in two diﬀerent languages.
In particular, every model FEn of T 0
En (or TEn) can be canonically made into
a model FExp of T 0
Exp (respectively TExp) and vice versa. This relationship
allows us to deduce that the predimension inequality (3.8) is adequate. We
proceed towards this goal in this section.

Exp and T 0

Henceforth by an En-ﬁeld (Exp-ﬁeld) we will mean a model of T 0

En (re-
spectively T 0
Exp). We will ﬁrst prove that an embedding of En-ﬁelds is the
same as an embedding of Exp-ﬁelds and thus establish the isomorphism of
categories of En-ﬁelds and Exp-ﬁelds. Then we will deﬁne strong embeddings
and show that the same holds for them as well. At the end we will formulate
the main results of this section that show the adequacy of our predimension,
but we will omit the proofs since they directly follow from their counterparts
for the exponential diﬀerential equation proven in [Kir06].

We saw that Exp is quantiﬁer-free deﬁnable in an En-ﬁeld and that En is
existentially deﬁnable in an Exp-ﬁeld. The following lemma implies imme-
diately that En is also universally deﬁnable in an Exp-ﬁeld. For an En-ﬁeld
(or Exp-ﬁeld) FEn we let CF be its ﬁeld of constants.

Lemma 6.1. Let KEn and FEn be two En-ﬁelds. Then KEn ⊆ FEn if and
only if KExp ⊆ FExp.

Proof. Since Exp is quantiﬁer-free deﬁnable in an En-ﬁeld, we only need to
show that KExp ⊆ FExp implies KEn ⊆ FEn. Let a, b0, . . . , bn−1 ∈ K be such
that

We shall show that

FExp |= En(a, b0, . . . , bn−1).

KExp |= En(a, b0, . . . , bn−1).

We can assume that a is non-constant. By (A3’) we know that there are

e1, . . . , ek ∈ F × with Exp(µia, ei) and elements aij ∈ CF such that

bl =

k

ni−1

Xi=1

Xj=0

aijgijl(a)ei,

for l = 0, . . . , n − 1. If Exp(u, v) holds for some u, v then Exp(u, cv) holds as
well for any constant c. Hence we can assume without loss of generality that
aij is either 0 or 1. As gijl(X) ∈ CK[X], we can express all ei’s with ai0 = 1

17

in terms of gijl(a) and bl (this is because the corresponding determinant does
not vanish). Hence ei ∈ K and we are done by (A3’) again.

This lemma shows that the category of En-ﬁelds with morphisms being
embeddings is isomorphic to the category of Exp-ﬁelds again with embed-
dings as morphisms.

From now on we we will work with En-ﬁelds (Exp-ﬁelds) with ﬁxed ﬁeld
of constants C. More precisely, we can take an ℵ0-saturated model FEn (with
universe F) of TEn with the ﬁeld of constants C and consider all En-subﬁelds
of FEn that have C as ﬁeld of constants (see [Kir06] for more details). Thus
FEn will serve as a monster model for us and we will assume in the rest of
the paper that all En-ﬁelds that we will mention are substructures of FEn.

We extend our deﬁnition of properness to constants. For a constant c ∈ C
by a proper solution to E(c, z0, . . . , zn−1) we mean a constant solution, i.e.
any n-tuple (c0, . . . , cn−1) ∈ C n.

Deﬁnition 6.2. For x ∈ Fm we deﬁne its En-predimension δEn(x) as

tr. deg.C C(x, z0, z1, . . . , zn−1) − l. dimQ(λ1x, . . . , λnx/C)

where (zi0, . . . , zi,n−1) ∈ Fn is a proper (i.e. C-linearly independent) solution
to En(xi, zi0, . . . , zi,n−1) for each i = 1, . . . , m.

This is obviously well-deﬁned, i.e. δEn does not depend on the choice of

a proper solution. The Exp-predimension is deﬁned similarly by

δExp(x) = tr. deg.C C(x, y) − l. dimQ(x/C),

where yi is non-zero with Exp(xi, yi).

If x ∈ C m then δEn(x) = δExp(x) = 0. It is easy to see that

δEn(x) = δExp(λ1x, . . . , λnx).

The inequality (3.8) asserts that δEn(x) is always non-negative and it is

zero if and only if x is constant.

Notation. By X ⊆f in Y we mean X is a ﬁnite subset of Y . We will some-
times write XY for X ∪ Y .

Deﬁnition 6.3. Let KEn ⊆ FEn be En-ﬁelds. We say that the embedding
is strong or that KEn is a strong substructure of FEn, written KEn ≤ FEn, if
for any X ⊆f in K and Y ⊆f in F the inequality δEn(X) ≤ δEn(XY ) holds.
Strongness of Exp-ﬁelds is deﬁned similarly.

18

Lemma 6.4. Let KEn ⊆ FEn be En-ﬁelds. Then KEn ≤ FEn if and only if
KExp ≤ FExp.

Proof. It is obvious that KExp ≤ FExp implies KEn ≤ FEn. Let us prove that
the converse implication holds as well.

Let KEn ≤ FEn. We will assume for simplicity that n = 2 and that λ1
and λ2 are Q-linearly independent. The same proof works for any n but
notations become cumbersome.

Pick arbitrary tuples x ∈ K and y ∈ F . We must show that δExp(x, y) ≥

δExp(x). We will prove that

δExp(λ1x, λ1y) − δExp(λ1x) ≥ δEn(x, y) − δEn(x).

(6.10)

For j = 1, 2 denote

m

Xj :=

{λjxi, ui : FEn |= Exp(λjxi, ui)}.

[i=1

Similarly deﬁne Yj. Also let xj = λjx and yj = λjy. Then the inequality
(6.10) is equivalent to the following:

tr. deg.(X1X2Y1Y2) − l. dim(x1, x2, y1, y2) − tr. deg.(X1X2) + l. dim(x1, x2) ≤
tr. deg.(X1Y1) − l. dim(x1, y1) − tr. deg.(X1) + l. dim(x1).

(Here transcendence degree is over C and linear dimension is over Q mod-
ulo C.) It is not diﬃcult to deduce this inequality from submodularity of
transcendence degree and modularity of linear dimension combined with the
following easy inequality:

tr. deg.(X1X2Y1Y2)−l. dim(x1, x2, y1, y2) ≤ tr. deg.(X1X2Y1)−l. dim(x1, x2, y1).

Now assume C is countable (and of transcendence degree ℵ0) and con-
sider the class C of En-ﬁelds with ﬁeld of constants C. The above lemma
shows that this class (category) with strong embeddings is the same as that
of Exp-ﬁelds with strong embeddings. Therefore the results of [Kir06] imply
that C has the free amalgamation property and hence is an ℵ0-amalgamation
category (see [DG92, Kir06] for details). So there is a unique (up to isomor-
phism) countable En-ﬁeld U which is universal and saturated with respect to
strong embeddings. In this case one says that U is obtained by a Hrushovski
construction with predimension δEn (this is not a full Hrushovski construc-
tion where one also collapses the amalgam U). This U also satisﬁes the
strong existential closedness property, that is, it is existentially closed in
strong extensions. Furthermore, the following result can be deduced from its
Exp-counterpart.

19

Theorem 6.5. Let F be the countable saturated diﬀerentially closed ﬁeld.
Then U is isomorphic to FEn. In particular, the En-reduct of any diﬀeren-
tially closed ﬁeld is elementary equivalent to U.

Thus the reduct FEn is given by a Hrushovski construction. In this case

we say, following B. Zilber, that δ is an adequate predimension.

We conclude our paper with two further observation. The axiomatisation
of TEn given in Section 4 is ∀∃. One can also notice that TEn is not model
complete since otherwise TExp would be model complete too, which is not the
case (note nevertheless that TEn is nearly model complete). In this situation
one can apply Theorem 8.1 of [Asl16] to conclude that D is not deﬁnable in
TEn. One could also prove this using the fact that TExp does not deﬁne D
(which can be found in [Kir06] and [Asl16]).

Finally, we remark that our analysis here suggests that if a diﬀerential
equation has order higher than one, then in order to study the question of
ﬁnding an adequate predimension inequality one should not consider reducts
with a binary relation for the equation but rather reducts with a predicate
of higher arity as in the case of higher order linear diﬀerential equations.
