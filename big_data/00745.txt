Abstract. Scanning tunnelling microscopy and density functional theory studies
of manganese chains adsorbed on Cu2N/Cu (100) reveal an unsuspected electronic
edge state at ∼ 1 eV above the Fermi energy. This Tamm-like state is strongly
localised to the last Mn atom of the chain and fully spin polarised. However, no
equivalence is found for occupied states, and the electronic structure at ∼ −1 eV is
mainly spin unpolarised due to the extended p-states of the N atoms that mediate the
coupling between the Mn atoms in the chain. Odd-numbered Mn chains present an
exponentially decreasing direct coupling with distance between the two edges, leading
to a vanishing bonding/anti-bonding splitting of states while even-numbered Mn chains
present perfect decoupling of both edges due to the the antiferromagnetic ordering of
Mn chains.

1. Introduction

Magnetic nanochains are experiencing a lot of interest due to their quasi 1-D character
that confers them with extraordinary properties [1]. Atomic magnetic nanochains
are the best examples of what magnetic nanodevices can achieve and how they can
be instrumental for spintronics [2]. These chains are assembled using the atom
manipulation capabilities of the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). Magnetic atoms
have been positioned one by one at diﬀerent distances and with diﬀerent arrangements
on a variety of substrates [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The STM has permitted to characterize
the chains by their spin signature using spin-polarised tips [9] and by their inelastic
electron tunnelling spectra (IETS) [10, 11]. These measurements give unprecedented
insight into the atomic mechanisms leading to magnetic ordering in nanostructures that
can be compared with state-of-the-art theoretical results.

Theoretical works are generally based on density functional theory (DFT) studies.
These works evaluate the actual atomic arrangements of the atoms on the surface, the
local and global magnetic moments, as well as the magnetic anisotropy energies, the
exchange couplings among the chain constituents and the possibility of canting due to
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. For the case of Mn chains on Ni (100), Lounis
and co-workers [12] showed that the competition of the diﬀerent exchange couplings in
the system led to an even/odd eﬀect with the number of Mn atoms; even-numbered
chains presenting a non-collinear arrangement of their spins and chains with an odd
number of atoms a collinear antiferromagnetic ordering. Rudenko and collaborators [13]
performed thorough calculations of Mn chains on a Cu2N/Cu (100) substrate. They
reproduced the exchange couplings between atoms that lead to magnetic excitation
spectra in good agreement with the experimental ones [3]. Furthermore, they included
spin-orbit interactions with diﬀerent methods to study the non-collinearity of the
magnetic-moment distributions, and they obtained that the Mn atoms had an out-of-
plane easy axis, and that the canting of spins due to anisotropic exchange interactions
was very small. Another complete study of Mn and Co chains on Cu2N/Cu (100)
was performed by Lin and Jones [14] where they extended their previous results [15]
and conﬁrmed that the atoms maintain their nominal spins on the surface, S=5/2 for
Mn. Nicklas and co-workers [16] studied Fe chains on Cu2N/Cu (100) showing that as
for Mn, [13] N-mediated superexchange leads to antiferromagnetic coupling of the Fe
atoms, in good agreement with later experimental measurements [5]. The interpretation
of these experiments has shown the importance of correlation and entanglement in
these antiferromagnetic chains [17]. Urdaniz et al. [18] performed a thorough study
of Cr, Fe, Mn and Co chains on Cu2N/Cu (100) using DFT calculations showing
that the adsorption site determines to a great extent the type of magnetic coupling
of the chain. This is presently used to generate atomic chains with diﬀerent coupling
schemes [19]. DFT calculations show how important it is to take into account the
actual geometries of the chain, because this can completely change their electronic and
magnetic behaviour [20, 21].

All these works focus in the low-energy structure tunnelling conductance spectra
that has a direct link to the magnetic properties of the crafted nano-objects.
Surprisingly, no work has been studied on the larger energy scale that actually has
inﬂuences on the magnetic properties of these systems. In the present work, we report
on the electronic structure with a special attention to states originating in orbitals more
extended than pure d-electrons. We show that there are long-lived edge states that
maintain strict localisation. These edge states are Tamm states due to the unsaturated
bond of the edge Mn atom caused by the tilting of the last N–Mn bond together with the
diﬀerent nature of the last N atom. This last N atom presents a diﬀerent environment
(lack of Mn atom on one side, and a closer N-substrate distance) breaking the symmetry
of the chain. The case of even-numbered Mn chains is particularly relevant for the link
between the edge state and the particular magnetic properties of the chains. These
edge states are at ∼ 1 eV above the Fermi level. A broader resonance is also found
for occupied states at about ∼ −1 eV. However, there are no speciﬁc magnetic features
associated with this state and it is rather a state originating in the covalent bonding of
the Mn atoms with the N atoms glueing the Mn chain together. The magnetic structure
of the Mn chains are due to the spin polarization of the d-electrons, much lower in energy
than the ∼ −1 eV structure of the N-Mn bonds.

2. Experimental method

Experiments were performed in an ultrahigh-vacuum low-temperature STM at a base
temperature of 1.15 K. The diﬀerential conductance was directly measured using lock-in
detection with a 2-mV rms modulation at 938 Hz of the sample bias V.

The Cu(100) surface was cleaned by Ar sputtering and then annealed up to 650
K. After having big terraces of the Cu(100) crystal, a monolayer of Cu2N was formed
as a decoupling layer by N irradiation. Single Mn atoms were deposited onto the cold
surface. By capturing the Mn atom with the tip and dropping it onto the substrate
via bias pulses, the single atoms were arranged into closed-packed Mn chains along the
[010]-direction of the Cu2N surface. This leads to mono-atomic chains of Mn atoms
ontop of Cu atoms that are aligned along a nitrogen row, identical to the structures
reported in Ref. [3].

3. Theoretical method

Ab initio calculations were performed within the density-functional theory (DFT)
framework as implemented in the VASP code [22]. We have expanded the wave functions
using a plane-wave basis set with a cutoﬀ energy of 300 eV. Core electrons were treated
within the projector augmented wave method [23, 24]. The PBE form of the generalized
gradient approximation was used as exchange and correlation functional [25]. To model
the surface we have used a slab geometry with four Cu layers plus the Cu2N layer. We
have used an optimized theoretically lattice constant for Cu of 3.65 ˚A.

Following the above experimental procedure, the transition-metal atoms are
positioned on Cu atoms, forming a chain in the [010] direction. We have used a unit
cell that increases its size along this direction with the number of atoms of the chain
as [3 × (n+3)], where n is the number of Mn atoms. In this way we keep the distance
between chain images constant for all sizes, being of 3 lattice constants in the unrelaxed
conﬁguration. The bottom Cu layer was kept ﬁxed and the remaining atoms were
allowed to relax until forces were smaller than 0.01 eV/˚A. The k-point sample was
varied accordingly to the unit cell, and tests were performed to assure its convergence.
In order to account for the atomic magnetic moments of the Mn atoms on the
surface, the GGA+U method of Dudarev et al [26] was employed, with a Ueff = U − J
of 4 eV. The chosen values correspond to roughly substracting J ≈ 1 to U = 4.9 eV as
computed by Lin and Jones [14] for Mn ontop a Cu atom.

4. Results

4.1. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy of electronic states

Constant current STM images obtained for sample biases above 1V show that the Mn
chains develop a “dumbell” shape and present enhanced states at the edges. Figure 1
(a) shows the image obtained at Vs = 2 V. Here the distortion is evident for Mn5
and Mn6. Mapping the conductance at a ﬁxed bias of 1V gives direct evidence of the
localisation of the contributing electronic states. Indeed, Fig. 1 (b) shows that most of
the conductance is located on the borders of the corresponding protrusions of Fig. 1 (a).
However, no spatial feature can be appreciated at negative bias. Figure 1 (c) depicts
the constant current image at -1V and a featureless protrusion straddles the atoms of
the chain. Consequently, the corresponding dI/dV map (not shown) does not reveal any
localisation inside the chain.

In order to gain more insight, we plot in Fig. 1 (d) the conductance as a function
of bias for three diﬀerent positions over the Mn6 chain. When the tip is above a chain’s
edge, a distinct peak is detected at 1V. This is in good correspondence with the previous
Figs. 1 (a) and (b), and strongly suggests that there is an electronic state localised at the
edges of the Mn chains. When the bias is shifted to negative biases, there is a broader
peak at ∼ −1 V with larger intensity at the centre of the chain. From these data, we
conclude that an electronic edge state appears at ∼ 1 V, while for occupied states an
electronic state appears at ∼ −1 V with an broader line shape, and extended along the
chain.

Figure 2 displays the tunnelling conductance as a function of bias for Mn2, Mn3,
Mn4, and Mn5. As the size of the Mn chains is reduced, the occupied states evolve
becoming very broadened and undistinguishable from the conductance background,
Fig. 2. On the contrary, the spectral intensity for the unoccupied state at the edges
increases as the chain is reduced. Moreover, the state stays at the same energy position,
independently of the chain’s length, supporting its localised character.

map at 1 V over the same area (Vs = 1 V, It = 1 nA, lock-in modulation 10mV rms

the conductance. (c) The constant current image at -1 V is rather featureless over all
the chains (Vs = -1 V, It = 100 pA). (d) The tunnelling conductance as a function
of applied bias over three diﬀerent spots on the surface (feed back opened at Vs =
-2 V, It = 1.5 nA). The Conductance on the edge of the Mn6 chain clearly displays a
maximum at ∼ 1 V and another maximum at ∼ -1 V. At the centre of the chain the
maximum at ∼ 1 V is not present but the maximum at ∼ -1 V is slightly displaced.
For comparison the conductance of the clean Cu2N/Cu (100) surface is shown.

4.2. Density functional theory characterisation of the electronic states

Structural relaxation of the Mn atomic chains reproduce the geometry and bonding
conﬁguration from previous theoretical results [13, 16, 18]: Mn atoms induce an
important reconstruction of the supporting substrate by incorporating N atoms to form
a Mn-N-Mn-N- ··· chain. This has important consequences both for the electronic
structure and the magnetic ordering of the atoms. Figure 3(a) shows isosurfaces of spin
density. In agreement with previous experimental studies [3], this corroborate that Mn
atoms interact antiferromagnetically with their neighbours, as discussed by Rudenko et

al. [13], and also by Nicklas et al. [16] for the case of Fe chains on the same substrate.
The joining N atoms serve both to stabilise the chain via covalent bonding with the Mn
atoms, and to induce the antiferromagnetic order through a superexchange interaction,
clearly seen by the equal coexistence of the two spins on the N atoms in Fig. 3(a). These
results imply that the actual arrangement of Mn and N atoms does matter and diﬀerent
magnetic orderings can be achieved [18]. These results also show that the occupied
electronic structure associated with N atoms must be spin unpolarised.

Figure 3(b) plots the spin-polarised density of states projected onto Mn d-states.
As previously mentioned [13, 14, 16, 18], the d electrons maintain the free-atom
conﬁguration of Mn in the chains with all majority spin d-orbitals occupied and the
minority one empty. Figure 3(b) also shows that the PDOS on d-electrons is mainly
independent of the size of the Mn chains, indicating that their d-electron states are
fairly localised and not perturbed by neighbouring Mn atoms.

A consequence of the ﬁnite size of the chains is the apparition of additional localised
states at the terminations due to the change of geometry. In strong correspondence with
the experimental results, we ﬁnd at Vs ∼1 eV above the Fermi energy a state purely
localised at the edges. This state, depicted in Fig. 3(c) for the case of a Mn3 trimer, is
strictly spin-polarised, and has very little weight on atoms other than the two edge Mn
atoms. It thus has a small intrinsic width.

The projected density of states gives us more information on the two states found
in the STM studies (Figs. 1 and 2). The edge states only have contributions from s and
dz2 orbitals (where z is the direction along the Mn chain). This leads to a sharp peak in
the density of states projected onto the 4s orbital of the edge Mn atom, centred at ∼ 1
V, Fig. 3(d). These data allow us to characterize the edge state as a Tamm state due to

the unsaturated s − dz2 hybrid orbital formed by the twisting of the chain at the edge.
The state at ∼ −1 eV is also found in DFT if the full electronic structure is
projected onto the p orbitals of the central N-atoms of the chain. Figure 3(d) shows a
sharp peak in the PDOS of the pz orbital of the third N atom in the Mn6 chain. This
allows us to characterize the experimental peak at ∼ −1 V as a chain state originating
in the N-atoms. The PDOS on the p orbitals of the central N-atoms is identical for
both spins, as we expected for electronic states with a strong N component. Hence, the
experimental peak for occupied states corresponds to a state extended over the chain
with a strong N character.

To explore the evolution the edge states with chain length we compare in Fig. 4 the
density of states projected on an edge Mn atom for Mnn chains with n = 3, 4, 5, 6. In
agreement with the experimental results in Fig. 2, the edge state is observed pinned at
∼ 1 eV and having basically the same shape regardless of the length of the chain. This
is due to the large localisation of the state at the edge Mn atoms, thus interacting very
weakly with the state at the other end. Even-numbered chains (Mn2n with n integer) are
an interesting case because, in a broken-symmetry description, the two edge states are
of opposite spin and localised to each edge atom due to the antiferromagnetic character
of the chains. The localisation of the edge states due to their opposite magnetism holds
even when preserving the full entanglement of the antiferromagnetic solution. As a
consequence, even for the dimer, Mn2, the two edge states are not interacting. However,
in Fig. 2, we observe that the conductance peak associated to the edge states increases
for Mn2. For such a small chain, the STM tip can couple simultaneously to both edge
states and, accordingly the conductance is expected to be larger.

In Fig. 4, we also observe that the edge state spin is anti-aligned with the spin of the
edge atom (majority spin). However, previous studies [27, 28] showed that the electron
transmission proceeded through the majority spin due to the prevailance of majority
spin electrons at the Fermi energy. Figure 4 shows indeed that for all chains the majority
spin density of states tends to be larger, leading us to conclude that as for the single
Mn atom, electron transmission through the chains at low bias takes part mainly in
the majority-spin channel, but at large positive biases the minority-spin components
dominate the transmission. Let us notice that the electronic structure of the single Mn
atoms and chains of Mn atoms are subject to diﬀerent symmetry due to the clear axis
of the Mn chains.

5. Conclusions

In summary, we have investigated the electronic structure of Mn atomic chains
contructed on Cu2N/ Cu (100) by atomic manipulation. We have found two electronic
states in the tunnelling spectra: an unoccupied Tamm state, very localised on the edge
atoms and an occupied state extended along the chain. The unoccupied state presents
a strict spin-polarisation, and is originated from the hybridization of Mn dz2 and 4s
orbitals. The occupied state has weight on both N and Mn atoms and it is not spin

polarised due to the absence of magnetism of the N atoms. We expect that in this
model system, the parity of the number of atoms would have an eﬀect in their spectral
ﬁngerprint. For even-numbered Mn chains, their antiferromagnetic character leads to
a strict localisation of their edge states into a single Mn edge atom because of the
opposite spin-polarisation of the states on each edge. This fact is independent of spin
entanglement. However, for odd-numbered chains, there is no spin decoupling of the
two edge states. Nevertheless, the small interaction between neighbouring Mn atoms
leads to eﬀectively decoupled edge states.
