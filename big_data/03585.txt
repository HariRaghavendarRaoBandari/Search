Abstract

Given two convex polytopes, the join, the cartesian product and the direct sum of them are well
understood. In this paper we extend these three kinds of products to abstract polytopes and introduce
a new product, called the topological product, which also arises in a natural way. We show that these
products have unique prime factorization theorems. We use this to compute the automorphism group
of a product in terms of the automorphism groups of the factors and show that (non trivial) products
are almost never regular or two-orbit polytopes. We ﬁnish the paper by studying the monodromy
group of a product, show that such a group is always an extension of a symmetric group, and give
some examples in which this extension splits.

1 Introduction

In school we all dealt, in one way or another, with solids such as prisms and pyramids, but maybe also
with bipyramids. The aim of this paper is to generalize these solids as diﬀerent products of abstract
polytopes, and study their symmetry and combinatorial properties.

Prisms, pyramids and bipyramids over polygons (see Figure 1) can be seen as a product of a polygon
by either a segment or a point. However, these are three diﬀerent kinds of products. While prisms are
the cartesian product of a segment with a polygon, pyramids are the join product of a point with a
polygon and bipyramids are the direct product of a segment with a polygon. In the theory of convex
polytopes the generalization of these three notions are the cartesian product, the join product and the
direct sum, respectively ([9]). Given two convex polytopes P ⊂ Rn and Q ⊂ Rm, their products are
deﬁned as follows.
The join of P and Q is obtained by embedding P and Q in disjoint aﬃne subspaces of Rn+m+1 and
taking the convex hull of their vertices. For example, for each d ≥ 1, a d-simplex can be seen as the join
of a point and a (d − 1)-simplex (Figure 2).
The cartesian product of P and Q is obtained by taking the convex hull of V (P) × V (Q) in Rn+m.
The classical example in this case, is to see a d-cube as the cartesian product of an edge -or line segment-
with a (d − 1)-cube (as in Figure 3).
The direct sum of P and Q is slightly more complicated to state. We ﬁrst require that P and Q
contain in their relative interiors the origins of Rn and Rm, respectively. Then the direct sum is the
convex hull of all the points of the form (v, 0) and (0, u), where v ∈ V (P) and u ∈ V (Q). For example,
cross polytopes can be generated in this way.

Note that as where in the join product and cartesian product of convex polytopes P and Q, every
face of P and of Q is again a face of the product, for the direct sum this is no longer the case. On the
other hand, for both the join product and the direct sum, the vertices of the product is the union of the
vertices of both polytopes, while the cartesian product of two polytopes, in general, has more vertices.
It is straightforward to see that the only convex polyhedra (or convex 3-polytopes) that arise as one of
these products are precisely the prisms, the pyramids and the bipyramids over polygons.
It is also well-know that, in R4, the product of two orthogonal circles S1 ×S1 is precisely the ﬂat torus
(also known as the Cliﬀord torus, [13]). If we place n points on each of the circles, evenly spaced, we
obtain n congruent line segments on each circle. Then, take the cartesian product of each point of each
S1 with line segment of the other S1. What you obtain is a tessellation of the ﬂat torus by squares (see
Figure 4). Hence, some maps on surfaces can also be seen as products of polygons.

Figure 4: The cartesian product of two pentagons can be seen as a tessellation of the torus by squares.

Abstract polytopes generalize the (face lattice) of convex polytopes. Moreover, they also generalize
non-degenerated maps. Hence, it is natural to generalise the four products described above and deﬁne
them for abstract polytopes, and we do so in Section 4. As we show, the four products are closed for
abstract polytopes, meaning that the product of two abstract polytopes is again an abstract polytope
(under any of the four products). We shall also study, for each product, which polytopes are trivial, in
the sense that the product of them with any polytope P is simply P. With that in mind, it is natural
to say that a polytope is prime with respect to a given product, if it cannot be decomposed as the
product of non-trivial polytopes. We show a unique prime factorization theorem and use it to investigate
the structure of the automorphism group of a product. Theorem A summarizes the main results of
Sections 4, 5 and 7.
Theorem A. Let P and Q be two abstract polytopes and (cid:12) be a product of polytopes (either the direct
sum, the join, cartesian or topological product). Then,

a) The product P (cid:12) Q = Q (cid:12) P is an abstract polytope. In particular, P (cid:12) P (cid:12) ··· (cid:12) P =: P m is also

an abstract polytope.

b) The polytope P can be uniquely factorized as a product of prime polytopes.
c) If P = Qm1

, where the Qi are distinct prime polytope with respect to (cid:12), then

r

1 (cid:12) Qm2

2 (cid:12) ··· (cid:12) Qmr

Γ(P) = Πr

i=1(Γ(Qi)mi (cid:111) Smi).

BBAAd) If P is decomposed as above, where Qi is a ki-orbit polytope, then P is a k-orbit polytope, with

((cid:80)r

k =

i=1 mini)!Πr

,

where if (cid:12) is the join product, then ni is the rank of Qi, if (cid:12) is either the cartesian product or the
direct sum, then ni + 1 is the rank of Qi, and if (cid:12) is the topological product, then ni + 2 is the rank
of Qi

As a corollary of part d) of Theorem A, for each product, we also obtained the families of regular and

two-orbit polytopes that are not prime.

The monodromy group of a polytope (either convex or abstract) encodes all the combinatorial infor-
mation of the polytope. It was ﬁrst studied by Hartley in [5] and he used it to construct regular covers of
(non-regular) polytopes. It is well-know that the monodromy group of a regular polytope is isomorphic
to its automorphism group. However, little is known about monodromy groups of non-regular polytopes.
In the last decade, there has been an eﬀort to understand these groups (see for example [2], [6], [12]).
In particular in [6] Hartely et al. study the monodromy group of the prism oven an n-gon and compute
it, in terms of generators and relations. Moreover, in [2], Berman et al. study that of the pyramid over
an n-gon and show that it is an extension of the symmetric group S4 by a cyclic group which sometimes
splits (and determine when). We show that products of polytopes are useful to understand monodromy
groups of some non-regular polytopes.

The results of monodromy groups of polytopes are summarized in the following theorem

Theorem B. Let Q1, . . .Qr be polytopes of ranks n1, n2, . . . , nr, respectively and let (cid:12) be a product of
polytopes. Let P = Q1 (cid:12) Q2 (cid:12) ··· (cid:12) Qr. Then,

a) The monodromy group M(P) is an extension of Sn, where n = Σr

i=1ni + c, and c = r, if (cid:12) =(cid:111)(cid:110),

c = 0 if (cid:12) = ×,⊕ and c = −r if (cid:12) = (cid:3).

b) The extension of a) splits (at least) in the following cases:

• If P is the prism (or the bipyramid) over an n-gon. In this case M(P) ∼= K (cid:111) S3, where K
is an extension (C2)3 by (Cm)3 (m =
gcd(n,4) ); moreover, this extension splits whenever n in

not congruent to 0 modulo 8, in which case M(P) ∼=(cid:0)(C2)3 (cid:111) (Cm)3(cid:1) (cid:111) S3.

• If P is the prism (or the bipyramid) over a 3-polytope having the property that all its vertex

n

ﬁgures (faces) are isomorphic to an n-gon, with n not congruent to 0 modulo 9;

• If (cid:12) = (cid:3) and each Qi has rank 2.

By [2], we already know that the monodromy group of a pyramid over an n-gon is an extension of S4
gcd(3,p) , and that such extension splits whenever n is not congruent to 0 modulo

by (Cm)4, where m =
9. Our techniques to show Theorem B can also be used to show this result.

2 Abstract polytopes

Abstract polytopes generalise the (face-lattice) of classical polytopes as combinatorial structures. In this
chapter we review the basic theory of abstract polytopes and refer the reader to [11] for a detail exposition
of the subject.
An (abstract) n-polytope (or (abstract) polytope of rank n) P is a partially ordered set whose elements
are called faces that satisﬁes the following properties. It contains a minimum face F−1 and a maximum

4

face Fn. These two faces are the improper faces of P; all other faces are said to be proper. There is a
rank function from P to the set {−1, 0, . . . , n} such that rank(F−1) = −1 and rank(Fn) = n. The faces
of rank i are called i-faces, the 0-faces are called vertices, the 1-faces are called edges and the (d− 1)-faces
are called facets. Every maximal totally ordered subset (called ﬂag) contains precisely n + 2 elements
including F−1 and Fn. If Φ is a ﬂag of P we shall often denote by Φi the i-face of Φ. For incident faces
F ≤ G, we deﬁne the section G/F := {H | F ≤ H ≤ G}, and when convenient, we identify the section
F/F−1 with the face F itself in P. The section Fn/F0 := {H | H ≥ F0}, when F0 is a vertex, is called
the vertex-ﬁgure of P at F0, and if Fi is a face of rank i > 0, then Fn/Fi is a co-face of P. All sections
G/F of P are by themselves posets with a rank function, minimum and maximum faces and satisfy that
all their maximal chains have the same number of elements. A section G/F is said to be connected, if
rank(G) − rank(F ) ≤ 2 or if whenever F (cid:48), G(cid:48) ∈ G/F , with F (cid:48), G(cid:48) (cid:54)= F, G, there exists a sequence of faces

F (cid:48) = F 0, F 1, F 2, . . . F k = G(cid:48),

such that F < F i < G and either F i ≤ F i+1 or F i+1 ≤ F i, for every i = 0, . . . k. We further ask that P is
strong connectivity, meaning that all the sections of P, including itself, are connected. The last condition
that P should satisfy to be a polytope, known as the diamond condition, is the following. If F and G
are incident faces such that rank(G) − rank(F ) = 2, then there exist precisely two faces H1 and H2 such
that F < H1, H2 < G. This property implies that for any ﬂag Φ and any i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 1} there exists
a unique ﬂag Φi diﬀering from Φ only in the i-face. The ﬂag Φi is called the i-adjacent ﬂag of Φ.

Up to isomorphism, there is a unique n-polytope for n = 0, 1. Polygons (including inﬁnite ones) are
2-polytopes and no-degenerated maps are 3-polytopes. In general, a convex d-polytope can be regarded
as an abstract d-polytope.
It is not diﬃcult to see that the diamond condition implies that the incidence structure consisting of
all vertices and edges of a polytope P, together with the incidence given in P is a graph. We shall refer
to this graph as the 1-skeleton of P.
An automorphism of a polytope is an order-preserving permutation of its faces. We denote the group
of automorphisms of P by Γ(P). It is straightforward to see that Γ(P) acts on the set of ﬂags, denoted
by F(P), in the natural way. Moreover, the strong connectivity of P implies that such action is free (or
semi-regular).
An n-polytope P is said to be regular whenever Γ(P) acts transitively on the ﬂags. We say that P is a
k-orbit polytope if Γ(P) has precisely k orbits on F(P). (Hence, regular polytopes and 1-orbit polytopes
are the same.)
Given a polytope P, one can deﬁne the dual of P, denoted by P∗, as the poset whose elements coincide
with the elements of P, but the order is reversed. In other words, P∗ is the dual of P if there exists a
bijection δ : P → P∗ that reverses the order. Note that (P∗)∗ ∼= P and that Γ(P) ∼= Γ(P∗).
The monodromy group M(P) = (cid:104)r0, r1, . . . rn−1(cid:105) of an n-polytope P is the subgroup of the permu-
tations of the set of ﬂags F(P) that is generated by the permutations ri : Φ (cid:55)→ Φi (see [5, 10]). The
elements of the monodromy group are, in general, far from being automorphisms of the polytope. By
the connectivity of P, M(P) is transitive on F(P). One can think of the generators of the monodromy
group as the instructions to assemble the ﬂags of the polytope. In fact the monodromy group possesses
all the combinatorial information of the polytope. Given w ∈ M(P), γ ∈ Γ(P) and Φ ∈ F(P) it is
straightforward to see that (Φw)γ = (Φγ)w.
The generators r0, r1, . . . , rn−1 of M(P) are involutions and satisfy, at least, the relations rirj = rjri
whenever |i − j| > 1. Whenever P is a regular polytope, its monodromy group and its automorphism
group are isomorphic. However, in other cases little is known about the structure of the monodromy
group of a polytope (see [12] for further discussion on the subject).

2.1 Hasse diagram
Given a poset P and F, G ∈ P, we shall say that F is covered by G if F < G and there exists no H ∈ P
such that F < H < G. In particular, if P is a polytope, then a face F is covered by a face G whenever
F < G and rank(G) − rank(F ) = 1. The Hasse diagram of the poset P, denoted by H(P) is the directed
graph whose vertices are the elements of P and there is an arc from a face G to a face F whenever F is
covered by G.
Note that if P is a polytope, then the digraph H(P) has one sink, one source, is acyclic and directed
paths of maximal length have n + 2 vertices. Moreover, F < G in P if and only if there is a directed path
from G to F in H(P). Therefore if P and Q are two polytopes such that there exists and isomorphism
between H(P) and H(Q), then it induces an isomorphism between P and Q (and viceversa: isomorphisms
between P and Q induce isomorphisms between their Hasse diagrams). Note further that Γ(P) ∼=
Γ(H(P)).
A poset P is said to be discrete if the transitive closure of the Hasse diagram H(P) is P itself. For
example Z is a discrete poset, while Q is not. All abstract polytopes are discrete posets. Hence, in this
paper, unless otherwise indicated, all posets are discrete.

3 Product of posets and digraphs

As we have seen before, one can identify an abstract polytope with its Hasse diagram. For the purpose of
this paper it shall prove helpful to often think of abstract polytopes as directed graphs (with the induced
properties). Thus, we study here some properties about products of posets and digraphs.
Given posets Qi with i ∈ I, the (cardinal) product, Πi∈IQi is the ordered set on their Cartesian
product, with component-wise order. Denoting by P ∗ Q the product of two posets P and Q, it is then
straightforward that P ∗Q = Q∗P and that, if K is yet another poset, then P ∗ (Q∗K) = (P ∗Q)∗K =:
P ∗ Q ∗ K. We denote by P k to the product of k copies of P.
Given F, G ∈ P, with F ≤ G, the set {H ∈ P | F ≤ H ≤ G} is the closed interval between F and
G. Similarly, {H ∈ P | F < H < G} is said to be an open interval. (Hence, sections of a polytope are
in fact closed intervals of the poset.) If the poset P does not have a minimum or a maximum, the sets
{H ∈ P | F ≤ H}, {H ∈ P | F ≥ H} , {H ∈ P | F < H} and {H ∈ P | F > H} are also said to be
(closed/open, resp.) intervals of P. We say that a poset P is factorable if there exist non-trivial posets
P1 and P2 such that P = P1 ∗ P2 and that P is prime if no such factorization exists.
In [8] Hashimoto shows that if we have two proper factorizations of a poset P, then there exists
another proper factorization of P that is a reﬁnement of the two original ones. Hashimoto then uses this
result to show the following theorem.

Theorem 3.1 ([8]). Every connected poset has a unique prime factorisation (up to isomorphism).

In this context, a poset P is said to be connected if for any two elements F, G ∈ P, there exists a

sequence F = F0, F1, . . . Fk = G such that Fi ≤ Fi−1 or Fi ≥ Fi−1 for every i ∈ {1, . . . , k}.

Recall now that a graph G is said to be connected if for any two vertices u and v, there is a u-v path
in G. A digraph is said to be weakly connected if its underlying graph (where the arcs are replaced by
edges) is connected. A discrete poset is connected if and only if is its Hasse diagram is weakly connected.
Given two digraphs D1 = (V1, E1) and D2 = (V2, E2), the cartesian product of D1 and D2 is a digraph
D = D1 × D2 whose vertex set is V (D) = V1 × V2, and such that there is an arc (v1, v2) → (w1, w2) if
v1 = w1 and v2 → w2 ∈ A2 or if v2 = w2 and v1 → w1 ∈ A1.

It was shown in [14] that the Hasse diagram of a product of orders is a product of Hasse diagrams.

In fact we have the following proposition.

6

Proposition 3.2 ([14]). Let Qi, with i ∈ I, be a family of posets. If P ∼= ΠQi, then H(P) ∼= ΠH(Qi).
Moreover, in [15], Walker showed that if P is a poset such that H(P) = Πi∈I Gi, for some digraphs
Gi, then there exist posets Qi, such that H(Qi) = Gi for each i ∈ I and Πi∈IQi = P.
Given a digraph D, if there exists digraphs D1 and D2 such that D = D1 × D2, where |V1|,|V2| > 1,
then we say that D is cartesian-factorable (or, simply, factorable) and that D = D1 × D2 is a proper
factorization of D. If no such factorization exists, we shall say that D is prime.

Hence, a poset P is prime if and only if its Hasse diagram H(P) is a prime digraph.

4 Products of polytopes

As pointed out in the introduction, geometrically, there are several kinds of products of polytopes. In
this section we deﬁne each of them as products of abstract polytopes. We shall see that although the
diﬀerent products that we deﬁne have diﬀerent geometric interpretations, they can all be expressed in
terms of cardinal products of posets.

4.1 Join product

Geometrically the most natural product might be the cartesian one, however when considering abstract
polytopes the natural product arrises from the product of posets. We therefore start by studying such
product of polytopes.

Given two polytopes P and Q, the join product of P and Q, denoted P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q, is deﬁned as the set

P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q = {(F, G) | F ∈ P, G ∈ Q},

(4.1)

where the order is given by

(F, G) ≤P(cid:111)(cid:110)Q (F (cid:48), G(cid:48)) if and only if F ≤P F (cid:48) and G ≤Q G(cid:48).

(4.2)
In other words, P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q is simply the cardinal product P ∗Q of the posets P and Q. (We have changed
the notation as we shall only use the join product P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q when both P and Q are polytopes, while we
shall keep referring to the product P ∗Q as the product of any two posets.) It is therefore straightforward
to see that P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q is indeed a poset. Moreover, P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q = Q (cid:111)(cid:110) P and if K is another abstract polytope,
then (P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q) (cid:111)(cid:110) K = P (cid:111)(cid:110) (Q (cid:111)(cid:110) K) = P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q (cid:111)(cid:110) K. Hence, for every natural number k, P k denoted the
join product of P, k-times. Observe further that a section of P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q is the join of a section of P and a
section of Q. That is,
Lemma 4.1. Let P and Q be two polytopes and consider the join P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q. Let f, F ∈ P, g, G ∈ Q such
that f ≤ F and g ≤ G. Then

(F, G)/(f, g) ∼= F/f (cid:111)(cid:110) G/g.

If P and Q are two polytopes of ranks n and m respectively, then the rank functions of P and Q

naturally induce a rank function on P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q, namely,

rankP(cid:111)(cid:110)Q(F, G) = rankP (F ) + rankQ(G) + 1.

Hence, the rank function of P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q has range from −1 to n + m + 1, and therefore P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q shall have rank
n + m + 1.
It is not diﬃcult to see that, if P−1 and Q−1 denote the minimal faces of P and Q respectively, then
the vertices of P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q are of the form (P−1, v) or (u, Q−1), where v is a vertex of Q and u is a vertex of

7

P. Hence, the vertices of P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q are in bijection with the union of the vertices of P and Q. In general,
for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, if F is an i-face of either P (or Q), then (F, Q−1) (or (P−1, F )) is an i-face of P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q,
but these are not all the i-faces of P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q.
Proposition 4.2. Let P and Q be two polytopes of ranks n and m, respectively. Then P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q is a
polytope of rank n + m + 1.
Proof. First note that, if F−1 and G−1, and Fn and Gm are the minimal and maximal faces of P and Q
respectively, then (F−1, G−1) is the minimal face of P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q, while (Fn, Gm) is its maximal face.
Given two elements (Fi, Ga), (Fj, Gb) ∈ P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q such that (Fi, Ga) ≤P(cid:111)(cid:110)Q (Fj, Gb), there are ﬂags Φ
and Ψ of P and Q, respectively, such that Fi, Fj ∈ Φ, and Ga, Gb ∈ Ψ. It is straightforward to see that
the set

{(Fi, Ga) = (Φi, Ψa), (Φi+1, Ψa), . . . , (Φj, Ψa), (Φj, Ψa+1), . . . (Φj, Ψb) = (Fj, Gb)}

(which is a subset of P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q), is a chain of the order P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q that has one element of each rank from
rankP(cid:111)(cid:110)Q(Fi, Ga) to rankP(cid:111)(cid:110)Q(Fj, Gb). This implies that every ﬂag of P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q has exactly n + m + 3
elements, including (F−1, G−1) and (Fn, Gm).
We now turn our attention to show that P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q is strongly connected. Consider a section (F, G)/(f, g)
of P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q and let (H, K), (h, k) be two proper elements of (F, G)/(f, g). Then f ≤ h, H ≤ F and
g ≤ k, K ≤ G. By the strong connectivity of P and Q, there exist sequences

and

h = H 0, H 1, . . . , H u = H

k = K 0, K 1, . . . , K v = K

of elements of F/f and G/g, respectively, such that consecutive elements of each sequence are incident
and with f ≤ H i ≤ F , g ≤ K j ≤ G, for all i = 0, . . . u and j = 0, . . . v. Without loss of generality we
may assume that u ≤ v. Hence, the sequence

(h, k) = (H 0, K 0), (H 1, K 0), (H 1, K 1), (H 2, K 1), . . . (H u, K u), (H u, K u+1), . . . , (H u, K v) = (H, K)

is such that any two consecutive elements are incident and are all proper faces of the section (F, G)/(f, g)
of P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q. Hence (F, G)/(f, g) is connected and therefore P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q is strongly connected.
Finally, we show that the join product P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q satisﬁes the diamond condition. Let (F, G), (f, g) ∈
P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q be such that (f, g) ≤P(cid:111)(cid:110)Q (F, G) and

rankP(cid:111)(cid:110)Q(F, G) − rankP(cid:111)(cid:110)Q(f, g) = 2.

Then

since we have that f ≤ F and g ≤ G, the following possibilities arise:

(rankP (F ) − rankP (f )) + (rankQ(G) − rankQ(g)) = 2;

• rankP (F ) = rankP (f ) and rankQ(G) − rankQ(g) = 2;
• rankP (F ) − rankP (f ) = 1 and rankQ(G) − rankQ(g) = 1;
• rankP (F ) − rankP (f ) = 2 and rankQ(G) = rankQ(g).

Note that the ﬁrst and the last case are symmetric, so it suﬃces to consider one of them. In the ﬁrst
case, f = F and, by the diamond condition of Q, there are exactly two elements H1, H2 such that
g < H1, H2 < G. Therefore the only elements between (f, g) and (F, G) are (f, H1) and (f, H2). In the
second case the only two faces between (f, g) and (F, G) are (f, G) and (F, g). Therefore P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q satisﬁes
the diamond condition, and P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q is an abstract polytope.

8

The join product on abstract polytopes coincides with the join of two convex polytopes. To see this
one just needs to note that the 1-skeleton of P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q consists of the union of the 1-skeleton of P and
the 1-skeleton of Q, together with all the edges from vertices of P to vertices of Q. The most common
example of this product is a pyramid over a polygon: if v is a vertex (or a 0-polytope) and P is an n-gon (a
2-polytope with n vertices), then v (cid:111)(cid:110) P is simply the pyramid over the n-gon. Another common example
is to consider two edges e1 and e2 (or line segments), and the join of them: e1 (cid:111)(cid:110) e2 is a tetrahedron.
Suppose for a moment that we were to regard the empty polytope ∅ as an abstract polytope of rank
−1. Then, the join of ∅ with an n-polytope P would simply be the set {(∅, F ) | F ∈ P}, and the order
will be inherited by that of P. It should be then clear that ∅ (cid:111)(cid:110) P ∼= P. Conversely, if Q is a m-polytope
such that P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q ∼= P for every polytope P, then m = −1. Therefore we shall say that the only trivial

polytope with respect to the join product is the empty polytope.

If now we consider v to be a 0-polytope (that is, a vertex), then

v (cid:111)(cid:110) P = {(∅, F ) | F ∈ P} ∪ {(v, F ) | F ∈ P}.

That is, the join product of v with a polytope P gives us two copies of P. However, the rank of an
element of the type (∅, F ) is rankP (F ), while one of the type (v, F ) is rankP (F ) + 1, so the two copies of
P are at “diﬀerent levels”. We further note that (∅, F ) ≤ (v, G) if and only if F ≤P G (see Figure 5).

Figure 5: A sketch of the Hasse diagram of a pyramid over a polytope P.

The (n + 1)-polytope v (cid:111)(cid:110) P is called the pyramid of P and we shall denote it by Pyr(P). It is then
straightforward to see that if P is a 2-polytope (or a polygon), then Pyr(P) is simply the pyramid over
P. Furthermore,

Pyr(Pyr(. . . Pyr(v) . . . )) = Pyrk(v)

is the (k − 1)-simplex, which is a regular polytope (see Figure 2).
to P∗ and Q to Q∗, respectively, then

Note that the join product interacts nicely with the dual operation. If δ and ω are dualities from P

sending (F, G) to (F δ, Gω) is a bijection between P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q and P∗ (cid:111)(cid:110) Q∗ such that (F, G) ≤P(cid:111)(cid:110)Q (H, K)
if and only if (Hδ, Kω) ≤P∗(cid:111)(cid:110)Q∗ (F δ, Gω). That is, (δ, ω) is a duality from P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q to its dual, implying

(δ, ω) : P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q → P∗ (cid:111)(cid:110) Q∗

9

that

In particular if both P and Q are self-dual polytopes, then so is P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q.

(P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q)∗ ∼= P∗ (cid:111)(cid:110) Q∗.

4.2 Cartesian product and direct sum

The cartesian product of two abstract polytopes is the natural product when thinking on the geometry:
it generalises the cartesian product of two convex polytopes. The direct sum can (and will) be deﬁned
in terms of the cartesian product and dual polytopes.
Given two posets P and Q, with minimum faces F−1 and G−1, respectively, the cartesian product of
P and Q, denoted P × Q, is deﬁned as the set

P × Q = {(F, G) ∈ P ∗ Q | rankP (F ), rankQ(G) ≥ 0} ∪ {(F−1, G−1)},

(4.3)

where the order is given by

(F, G) ≤P×Q (F (cid:48), G(cid:48)) if and only if F ≤P F (cid:48) and G ≤Q G(cid:48).

(4.4)
Note that the cartesian product of two polytopes P and Q, as a set, is a subset of the P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q, the
join of P and Q. Hence, it follows at once that P × Q is a poset. The rank function on P × Q is deﬁned
in a diﬀerent way as for the join product: given a face (F, G) ∈ P × Q, with rankP(F ), rankQ(G) ≥ 0,
we deﬁne the rank of (F, G) as,

rankP×Q(F, G) = rankP (F ) + rankQ(G);

and we deﬁne the rank of (F−1, G−1) to be −1. Hence, if P is an n-polytope and Q is an m-polytope,
then rankP×Q is a function from P × Q to the set {−1, 0, . . . , n + m}. In contrast with the join product,
we no longer consider the empty set to be a rank −1 polytope, as if we did, we would only have that the
cartesian product of any polytope with the empty set is the empty set again. So the product is of no
interest.
Proposition 4.3. Let P and Q be two polytopes of ranks n and m, respectively. Then P×Q is a polytope
of rank n + m.
Proof. As pointed out above, P × Q is a poset. Clearly, (F−1, G−1) is its minimal face and, if Fn and
Gm denote the maximal faces of P and Q, respectively, then (Fn, Gm) is the maximal face of P × Q.
To see that all the ﬂags of P × Q have the same number of elements, and that P × Q is strongly
connected, one can simply adapt the proofs given in the previous section for P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q. Alternatively, one
can think of P × Q as a subset of P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q and use this contention to obtain the two properties.

Hence, one only needs to see that P × Q satisﬁes the diamond condition.
Let (F, G), (f, g) ∈ P × Q such that (f, g) ≤P×Q (F, G) and

rankP×Q(F, G) − rankP×Q(f, g) = 2.

Note that if (f, g) (cid:54)= (F−1, G−1), the result holds as it did for P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q. Hence, without loss of generality
we may assume that (f, g) = (F−1, G−1). This immediately implies that both F and G are proper faces
of P and Q, respectively, and that rankP×Q(F, G) = 1. If (H, K) ∈ P × Q is such that (F−1, G−1) <
(H, K) < (F, G), then 0 = rankP×Q(H, K) = rankP (H) + rankQ(K). Both H and K are proper faces
of P and Q, respectively, and therefore rankP (H) = rankQ(K) = 0. Since rankP×Q(F, G) = 1, then
rankP (F ) + rankQ(G) = 1, which in turns implies that either rankP (F ) = 1 and rankQ(G) = 0 or
In the ﬁrst case, by the diamond condition of P we have that
rankP (F ) = 0 and rankQ(G) = 1.
there exist two 0-faces H1, H2 such that F−1 < H1, H2 < F . This implies that (H, K) = (H1, G) or
(H, K) = (H2, G). The second case is similar and hence the diamond condition is satisﬁed.

The cartesian product of an edge with a polygon is precisely the prism over the polygon and the

The only trivial polytope with respect to the cartesian product is the 0-polytope v. It is straightforward

cartesian product of an edge with any polytope P is the prism over P.
to see that for any polytope P, P × v ∼= P, as the only 0-face of v is v itself. And conversely, if Q is a
polytope such that Q × P ∼= P for any polytope P, then by considering the rank of Q × P one deduces
that the rank of Q is zero and hence Q ∼= v.
v1 and v2 be the two 0-faces of e. Then, given an n-polytope P,

One interesting example for the cartesian product is to consider a 1-polytope e (that is, an edge). Let

e × P = {(v1, F ) | F ∈ P} ∪ {(v2, F ) | F ∈ P} ∪ {(e, F ) | F ∈ P, rankP (F ) ≥ 0}.

In this case, e × P has two isomrphic copies of P (at the same “level”), and a third copy of P with
the minimum removed, at one level higher (see Figure 6). We note further that while (vi, F ) ≤ (e, G)
whenever F ≤ G, for i = 1, 2, two faces of the type (v1, F ) and (v2, G) can never be incident.

Figure 6: Sketch of the Hasse diagram of a prism over a polytope P.

The (n + 1) polytope e × P is called the prism over P and shall be denoted by P ri(P). Hence,

P ri(P ri(. . . P ri(e) . . . )) = P rid(e) is the d-cube, which is a regular polytope.

The direct sum of a segment and a polygon is the bipyramid of the polygon. In the introduction we
gave a deﬁnition of the direct sum of two convex polytopes. The direct sum of two convex polytopes can
be described, using duality, in terms of a cartesian product. In fact, we have that for convex polytopes,
P ⊕ Q := (P∗ × Q∗)∗, (see for example [1, Lemma 2.4]) where P∗ denotes the polar dual of P .
Hence, given two abstract polytopes P and Q, we deﬁne the direct sum of P and Q, denoted by P ⊕Q,

simply as

P ⊕ Q := (P∗ × Q∗)∗.

It is straightforward to see that if Fn and Gm are the maximal elements of P and Q, respectively, then
we have that

P ⊕ Q = {(F, G) ∈ P ∗ Q | rankP (F ) < n and rankQ(G) < m} ∪ {(Fn, Gm)},

where the order is given by

(F, G) ≤P⊕Q (F (cid:48), G(cid:48)) if and only if F ≤P F (cid:48) and G ≤Q G(cid:48).

(4.5)

(4.6)

11

An immediate corollary of Proposition 4.3 is the following result.

Corollary 4.4. Let P and Q be two polytopes of ranks n and m, respectively. Then P ⊕ Q (as deﬁned
in (4.5) and (4.6)) is a polytope of rank n + m.

Similarly as above, the only trivial polytope with respect to the cartesian product is the 0-polytope v.

In fact, for any polytope P, P ⊕ v = (P∗ × v∗)∗ = (P∗)∗ ∼= P, as v∗ is v itself. And conversely, if Q is a
polytope such that Q ⊕ P ∼= P for any polytope P, then by considering the rank of Q ⊕ P one deduces
that the rank of Q is zero and hence Q ∼= v.
Given an n-polytope P, the (n+1)-polytope e⊕P is called the bipyramid over P, and shall be deonted
by Bpy(P). In this case, Bpy(Bpy(. . . Bpy(e) . . . )) =: Bypd(e) is the d-cross-polytope, which is a regular
(convex) polytope, that is dual to the d-cube.

4.3 Topological product

The last product that we consider in this paper, does not have a convex analogue. The name is given
with the following example in mind: the topological product of two polygons (homeomorphic to circles
S1) gives us a map on the torus (the product of S1 × S1).
Given an n-polytope P with minimum element F−1 and maximum element Fn, and an m-polytope
Q with minimal element G−1 and maximal element Gm, the topological product of P and Q, denoted by
P(cid:3)Q, is deﬁned as

P(cid:3)Q = {(F, G) ∈ P ∗ Q | 0 ≤ rankP (F ) < n, 0 ≤ rankQ(G) < m} ∪ {(F−1, G−1), (Fn, Gm)}, (4.7)

where the order is given by

(F, G) ≤P(cid:3)Q (F (cid:48), G(cid:48)) if and only if F ≤P F (cid:48) and G ≤Q G(cid:48).

(4.8)
Here, we say that the rank of the faces (F−1, G−1), (Fn, Gm) ∈ P(cid:3)Q are −1 and n+m−1, respectively,

and given (F, G) ∈ P(cid:3)Q with 0 ≤ rankP (F ) < n, 0 ≤ rankQ(G) < m, then

rankP(cid:3)Q(F, G) = rankP (F ) + rankQ(G).

Note that if P has rank 0, then P(cid:3)Q ∼= P for every polytope Q. Moreover, if P has rank 1, and Q
has rank at least 1, then P(cid:3)Q is not connected, implying that it is not a polytope. However, using a
similar proof as that of Proposition 4.3, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 4.5. Let P and Q be two polytopes of ranks n and m, respectively, with n, m ≥ 2. Then
P(cid:3)Q (as deﬁned in (4.7) and (4.8)) is a polytope of rank n + m − 1.

There are no trivial polytopes for the topological product. If P1, . . .Pd is a collection of 2-polytopes,
i=1Pi is a d-torus tessellated by d-cubes. In particular if every Pi is isomorphic to a p-gon, then
then (cid:3)d
i=1Pi is the regular (d + 1)-polytope {4, 3d−1}(a,0,...,0) (see [11]).
(cid:3)d

5 Unique factorization theorems for products of polytopes

The purpose of this section is to show that, for any of the four products described in the previous section,
any polytope can be factored in a unique way (up to isomorphism) as the product of prime polytopes. As
the proofs of this result for each of the four products are very similar, we shall ﬁrst view all four products
as cardinal products of posets and show some results for such products.

12

We start by noticing that given a n-polytope P with minimum element F−1 and maximum element

Fn, and an m-polytope Q with minimal element G−1 and maximal element Gm, we have that

P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q = P ∗ Q;
P × Q = (P \ {F−1}) ∗ (Q \ {G−1}) ∪ {(F−1, G−1)};
P ⊕ Q = (P \ {Fn}) ∗ (Q \ {Gm}) ∪ {(Fn, Gm)};
P (cid:3) Q = (P \ {F−1, Fn}) ∗ (Q \ {G−1, Gm}) ∪ {(F−1, G−1), (Fn, Gm)}.

In other words,

P (cid:111)(cid:110) Q = P ∗ Q;

P × Q \ {(F−1, G−1)} = (P \ {F−1}) ∗ (Q \ {G−1});
P ⊕ Q \ {(Fn, Gm)} = (P \ {Fn}) ∗ (Q \ {Gm});

P (cid:3) Q \ {(F−1, G−1), (Fn, Gm)} = (P \ {F−1, Fn}) ∗ (Q \ {G−1, Gm});

which says that maybe with exception of the minimum and maximum faces, the four products of polytopes
can be seen as cardinal products of posets.

Theorem 3.1 then implies that each of the four products of polytopes has a unique prime factorisation

in terms of posets, however, we want to show that the prime factors are also abstract polytopes.

The following lemma is straightforward.

Lemma 5.1. Let P be poset with minimum element (resp. maximumm) and suppose there exist posets
Q and K such that P = Q ∗ K. Then Q has a minimum element (resp. maximum).

By the commutativity of the product, the above lemma implies that also K has a minimum and/or
In what follows, for an n-polytope P, ˘P will be denoting a polytope P without its minimum and/or

maximum, whenever P has it too.
maximum elements. Hence, ˘P satisﬁes the following properties.
P1. ˘P is a poset with a rank function, in which all the maximal chains have the same number of

elements.

P2. ˘P satisﬁes the diamond condition for i = 1, . . . , n − 2, and for every face of rank n − 2 (1, resp.),

there are exactly two (n − 1)-faces (0-faces, resp.) incident to it.

P3. H( ˘P) is a weakly connected digraph, and every open interval of ˘P either has two elements or it is

also connected.

Note that if a poset Q satisﬁes the three above properties, we can extend Q by deﬁning a minimum
and a maximum elements of the order, and then the resulting new poset is indeed a polytope. In the
next lemmas we shall establish that the factors of a factorable poset ˘P have the properties P1, P2 and
P3.
Lemma 5.2. Let P be an n-polytope and suppose there exist posets Q and K such that ˘P = Q∗K. Then
Q (and therefore K) has a rank function. Furthermore, all the ﬂags of Q (and therefore of K) have the
same number of elements.
Proof. We assume that ˘P does not have a maximum and minimum elements. The arguments are similar
in the case it has one of them. Hence, ˘P has a rank function with range {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}. Fix (Q, K) to
be a maximal face of ˘P, thus, (Q, K) has rank n − 1.

13

Consider ˜Q := {(x, K) | x ∈ Q}. Then ˜Q ⊂ ˘P and ˜Q ∼= Q.
Note that the maximality of (Q, K) implies that for every x ∈ ˜Q, we have that rankP (x, K) ≤
rankP (Q, K) = n − 1. Hence, Q is a maximal element of Q (though most likely it is not maximum).
Moreover, as ˜Q ⊂ ˘P, then there exists q ∈ Q such that q < Q and rankP (q, K) ≤ rankP (x, K) for every
x ∈ Q. Thus, q is a minimal (but not minimum) element of Q.
Let a := rankP (q, K). We now show that if y is another minimal element of Q, then rankP (y, K) = a.
Since (q, K) < ˘P (Q, K), then we can complete {(q, K), (Q, K)} to a maximal chain Φ of ˘P. Hence, the
minimal element (q, k) of Φ has rank 0 in ˘P and k is a minimal element of K. Consider the set Φ< of all
that elements of Φ that have rank less or equal to a. Since q is minimal in Q, then the ﬁrst coordinate
of all such elements is in matter of fact q. Thus, the set Λ consisting of the second coordinates of Φ< is
a maximal chain of K.
Now, let y ∈ Q be a minimal element (of Q). We can complete (y, K) to a maximal chain Ψ of ˘P in
such a way that all the elements of Ψ with rank less than b := rankP (y, K) are of the form (y, x) with
x ∈ Λ. Since P is a polytope, then all the maximal chains of ˘P have n elements. Hence, both Φ and Ψ
have n elements. As the number of elements in Φ of rank less than a equals the number of elements in
Ψ of rank less than b, then the number of of elements in Φ of rank greater than a equals the number of
elements in Ψ of rank greater than b, implying that a = b.

Since P is an n-polytope, then there exists a rank function rankP : P → {−1, . . . , n}. Hence,

Thus, by deﬁning for each x ∈ Q,

rankP | ˜Q : ˜Q → {a, . . . , n − 1}.

rankQ(x) := rankP (x, K) − a,

(5.1)
we obtain a rank function from Q to the set {0, . . . , n − 1 − a}, and the ﬁrst part of the lemma has been
stablished.
Note now that any maximal chain of Q must have at most n − 1 − a + 1 = n − a faces. Let Φ be
a maximal chain of Q, and suppose Φ has less than n − a elements. Let y, z ∈ Q be the minimal and
maximal elements of Φ, respectively. We have shown that all minimal elements of Q have the same rank
and one can similarly show that all maximal elements also have the same rank. Hence, y, z have ranks
zero and n − a, respectively. So let c ∈ {1, . . . , n − a} be such that there is no element in Φ of rank c and
that c is minimal in that sense. Then, there exists w ∈ Q such that rankQ(w) = c − 1.
Let ˜Φ := {(x, K) | x ∈ Φ}. Then ˜Φ is a maximal chain of ˜Q. Extend ˜Φ to a ﬂag Ψ of ˘P, and consider
its faces Ψc+a−1 and Φc+a (of ranks c + a − 1 and c + a, respectively). Since rankQ(w) = c − 1, then
Ψc+a−1 = (w, K). As there exists no element of Q of rank c, there exists no element of ˜Q of rank c + a,
and therefore Φc+a is not an element of ˜Q. This implies that there exists G ∈ Q and H ∈ K with H < K
such that Φc+a = (G, H). But since Ψ is a ﬂag and (w, K), (z, K) ∈ Ψ, then (w, K) ≤ (G, H) ≤ (z, K).
This immediately implies that H = K, which is a contradiction.
Therefore for every c ∈ {0, . . . , n − a − 1} there is an element of Φ of rank c and thus all ﬂags of Q
have the same number of elements, namely n − a.
Lemma 5.3. Let P be an n-polytope and suppose there exist posets Q and K such that ˘P = Q∗K. Then
Q (and therefore K) is connected and so is every interval of it.
Proof. We start by showing that Q is connected. Suppose otherwise. Then H(Q) is a disconnected
digraph and hence H( ˘P) ∼= H(Q) ∗ H(K) is disconnected. This in turns implies that ˘P is disconnected,
We shall now see that every interval of Q is in fact isomorphic to an interval of ˘P. The proposition
In fact, given F, G ∈ Q with F < G, the intervals {H ∈ Q | F < H},

will follow then at once.

which is a contradiction.

14

{H ∈ Q | F > H} and {H ∈ Q | F < H < G} are respectively isomorphic to the intervals of {(x, M ) ∈
˘P | (F, M ) < (x, M )}, {(x, M ) ∈ ˘P | (F, M ) > (x, M )} and {(x, M ) ∈ ˘P | (F, M ) < (x, M ) < (G, M )},
where M is a ﬁxed element of K. Thus every interval of Q is connected.
Lemma 5.4. Let P be an n-polytope and suppose there exist posets Q and K such that ˘P = Q ∗ K. Let
m ∈ Z be such that rankQ : Q → {0, . . . , m} is the rank function deﬁned in (5.1). Then,

a) If F, G ∈ Q are such that F ≤ G with rankQ(G) − rankQ(F ) = 2, then there are exactly two faces

H ∈ Q such that F < H < G.

b) If F ∈ Q is such that rankQ(F ) = m− 1, then there are exactly two faces H ∈ Q such that F < H.
c) If G ∈ Q is such that rankQ(G) = 1, then there are exactly two faces H ∈ Q such that H < G.

Proof. We start by showing part a). Let M be an element of K. Then, (F, M ) ≤ (G, M ) and
rankP (G, M ) − rankP (F, M ) = 2. By the diamond condition of P there exist exactly two elements
x ∈ ˘P such that (F, K) < x < (G, K). By the deﬁnition of the cardinal product Q ∗ K, the second
coordinate of x must be K. Hence, part a) of the proposition follows. Parts b) and c) follow in a similar
fashion watching for the details. In fact for part b), we must set K = M a maximal element of K, while
for part c), K = m a minimal element of K.

Using Lemmas 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 we can now establish the following theorem.

Theorem 5.5. Let P be an n-polytope with minimum element F−1 and maximum element Fn and Q
and K be posets. Then we have the following.

1. If P = Q ∗ K, then both Q and K are polytopes.
2. If P \ {F−1} = Q ∗ K, then both Q and K have a maximum element and satisfy properties P1, P2

and P3.

3. If P \ {Fn} = Q ∗ K, then both Q and K have a minimum element and satisfy properties P1, P2

and P3.

4. If P \ {F−1, Fn} = Q ∗ K, then both Q and K satisfy properties P1, P2 and P3.

Corollary 5.6. Let P be an abstract polytope and let (cid:12) denote a product of polytopes (either the join,
cartesian or topological product, or the direct sum). Then P can be uniquely factorised as a (cid:12)-product
polytopes that are prime with respect to the product (cid:12).

Proof. The corollary follows from Theorems 3.1 and 5.5.

6 The ﬂags of a product

In Sections 7 and 8 we shall deal with the groups and orbits of products. To study these groups it shall
prove very helpful to have a better understanding of the structure of the ﬂags of a product. That is the
purpose of this section.
We start by analyzing the join product. Let P be an (n − 1)-polytope and suppose that P = Q1 (cid:111)(cid:110)
Q2 (cid:111)(cid:110) ··· (cid:111)(cid:110) Qr, for some polytopes Q1 . . .Qr such that Qi has rank ni − 1. This implies that

Without loss of generality we may assume that ni ≥ 1.

n = n1 + n2 + ··· + nr.

15

Let Φ be a ﬂag of P. Then Φ = {Φ−1, Φ0, Φ1, . . . , Φn−1}, where Φi has rank i. Since P is a product,

then for each i ∈ {−1, . . . n − 1} there exist F j

i ∈ Qj such that
i , . . . , F r

i , F 2

Φi = (F 1

By deﬁnition of the join product, we have that for each j = 1, 2, . . . , r,

n−1 are the minimum and maximum elements, respectively, of Qj. Note that many of
i are repeated in the above sequence, as otherwise P would be just a trivial product. That means

Now, since Φ = {Φ−1, Φ0, Φ1, . . . , Φn−1} is a ﬂag of P, then

i = j ∈
Φi = (F 1
{1, . . . , r} if and only Φi−1 and Φi diﬀer in their j entry. Thus, we can naturally identify each ﬂag Φ of
P with the ordered pair ({Ψ(1), Ψ(2), . . . , Ψ(r)}, a), where each Ψ(i) is the ﬂag of Qi described above and
a = {a(Φ)

n−1}. Clearly, two diﬀerent ﬂags of P deﬁne diﬀerent ordered pairs.

i−1, . . . , F r

Note further that for each ﬂag Φ ∈ F(P), the sequence a(Φ)
n−1 has exactly nj times the
integer j, for each j ∈ {1, . . . , r}.
Let A be the set of all ordered n-tuples a = {a0, a1, . . . , an−1} with aj ∈ {1, . . . , r} and such that each
j ∈ {1, . . . , r} appears exactly nj times in a. Given an ordered pair ({Ψ(1), . . . , Ψ(r)}, a), where Ψ(j) is
a ﬂag of Qj and a ∈ A, we can deﬁne the ﬂag Φ = {Φ−1, Φ0, . . . , Φn−1} of P as follows. The minimum
face of Φ, Φ−1 is the r-tuple (F 1−1, F 2−1, . . . F r−1), where each F j−1 is the minimum face of the polytope
Qj. Suppose that we have deﬁned the (i− 1)-face Φi−1 = (F 1
i−1) of Φ, in such a way that
i−1 is a face of the ﬂag Ψ(j) of Qj. Hence, for each j ∈ {1, . . . , r}, the face F j
i−1 of Qj has some rank,
F j
say tj, with −1 ≤ tj ≤ nj. The i-face Φi is the r-tuple that coincides with Φi−1 in all its entries, except
in the entry ai. The entry ai of Φi is the face of the ﬂag Ψ(ai) of rank tj + 1. Hence, in particular, Φ0
has all its entries equal the minimum face of the corresponding polytope (all of rank −1), except for its
a0 entry, which is the 0-face of the ﬂag Ψ(a0).
If we now take one of the other three products, the analysis of the ﬂags is very similar. The main
diﬀerences are in the way the set A should be deﬁned for each product and, thus, in the way to construct
a ﬂag of the product, given one ﬂag of each factor and an element of A. Alternatively, one can keep A
ﬁxed and adjust the ranks of the polytopes Qi as well as the deﬁnition of the vertices or the facets of
the product, depending on the product we are dealing with. Using similar methods as the ones explained
above one can show the following lemma.
Lemma 6.1. Let Q1,Q2, . . . ,Qr be polytopes and (cid:12) denote one of the four products discussed in Section 4
(that is, (cid:12) ∈ {(cid:111)(cid:110),×,⊕, (cid:3)}). Let P = Q1 (cid:12) Q2 (cid:12) ··· (cid:12) Qr and let F denote the set F(Q1) × F(Q2) ×
··· × F(Qr). Then there exists a bijection ϕP between F(P) and F × A, where, A is the set of ordered
n-tuples with entries in the set {1, . . . , r} and such that each j ∈ {1, . . . , r} appears exactly nj times in
a, n = n1 + n2 + ··· + nr, and nj is related to the rank of the polytope Qj in the following way:

7 Automorphism groups of products

In this section we turn our attention to the automorphism group of a product of polytopes. Throughout
the section, (cid:12) will denote one of the four products discussed in Section 4 (i.e., (cid:12) ∈ {(cid:111)(cid:110),×,⊕, (cid:3)}), and we
shall refer to the (cid:12)-product simply as the product. Likewise, a prime polytope will be a prime polytope
with respect to (cid:12).
Although (cid:12) cannot always be seen as a cardinal product of posets, we note that the automorphism
group of a polytope P coincides with the automorphism group of P taking away the minimum or maximum
elements or both. Hence, for proposes of computing the automorphism group of a product (cid:12) of polytopes,
without loss of generality we may assume that (cid:12) is in fact the cardinal product of posets.
We shall say that two polytopes P and Q are relatively prime if their (unique) prime factorization does
not have any prime polytopes in common. In particular, if both P and Q are diﬀerent prime polytopes,
then they are relatively prime.
In [3] (Corollary 2), Duﬀus shows that every automorphism γ of a product P ∗ Q of relatively prime
posets is the product of an automorphism γP of P times an automorphism γQ of Q. From this fact, we
obtain the following proposition.
Proposition 7.1. Let P and Q be two relatively prime polytopes. Then, Γ(P (cid:12) Q) ∼= Γ(P) × Γ(Q).

Corollary 2 of [3] also states that if Q is a prime poset and m ∈ N, then for any automorphism
γ of P := Πn
i=1Q there exist a permutation σ of the set {1, . . . , m} and automorphisms γ1, . . . , γm of
Q such that for every F = {F1, . . . , Fm} ∈ Q, and every i ∈ {0, . . . , m}, the i-th coordinate of the
element F γ is precisely Fiσγi (where iσ is precisely the image of i under the permutation σ). That
is, F γ = (F1σγ1, F2σγ2, . . . , Fmσγm). Moreover, it is clear that an element α = (α1, α2, . . . , αm) ∈
Γ(Q) × Γ(Q) × ··· × Γ(Q) acts naturally on the elements of P. Namely, F α = (F1α1, . . . Fmαm). From
these two facts, one can show the following proposition.
Proposition 7.2. Let Q be a prime polytope and let P := Πm

i=1Q. Then Γ(P) ∼= Πm

i=1Γ(Q) (cid:111) Sm.

By denoting Πm

i=1Q simply by Qm and Πm

i=1Γ(Q) as Γ(Q)m, from Propositions 7.1 and 7.2, we obtain

the following corollary, which settles part c) of Theorem A.
Corollary 7.3. If P = Qm1

, where the Qi are distinct prime polytope, then
i=1(Γ(Qi)mi (cid:111) Smi).

The main interest in the study of abstract polytopes has been the highly symmetric ones, being the
regular ones the most studied ones in the last 30 years (see for example [11]). As one naturally expects,
the product of two regular polytopes in general is not a regular polytope anymore. In fact, we shall see
that with exception of one family per product, regular polytopes are prime.
Although diﬀerent products are described in a slightly diﬀerent way, we can study them all under
the same scope, so we let (cid:12) ∈ {(cid:111)(cid:110),×,⊕, (cid:3)}. By Lemma 6.1, there is a bijection between the ﬂags of
P = Q1 (cid:12) Q2 (cid:12) ··· (cid:12) Qr and F × A, where F = F(Q1) × F(Q2) × ··· × F(Qr) and A is the set of
all sequences a1, . . . an such that ai ∈ {1, . . . , r} and that for each j ∈ {1, . . . , r} the integer j appears
exactly nj times in the sequence, nj stands for the rank of Qj plus or minus 1, depending which product
of polytopes we would want to consider and n − 1 = n1 + . . . nr − 1 is the rank of P.

Note that the cardinality of A is |A| =(cid:0) n

(cid:1), and let us denote F × A by B(P).

Suppose now that r = 2 (that is, P = Q1 ∗ Q2) and that the posets Q1 and Q2 are relatively primes.
Let γ ∈ Γ(P). Then, γ = (γ1, γ2), where γj ∈ Γ(Qj), and the action of γ on an element ({Φ1, Φ2}, a), of
B(P) is given by

(cid:1) . . .(cid:0)nr

(cid:1)(cid:0)n−n1

n2

n1

({Φ1, Φ2}, a)γ = ({Φ1γ1, Φ2γ2}, a).

17

Note that given a, a(cid:48) ∈ A with a (cid:54)= a(cid:48), there is no element of Γ(P) that can send an element of B(P)
with second coordinate a to one with second coordinate a(cid:48). Furthermore, in order to have ({Φ1, Φ2}, a)
and ({Ψ1, Ψ2}, a) in the same orbit, we need Φj and Ψj in the same orbit under Γ(Qj). If for each integer
ni, we let

(7.1)

then we have established the following lemma.
Lemma 7.4. Let P be an (n − 1)-polytope, and suppose P = Q1 (cid:12) Q2 with Q1 and Q2 relatively prime
with respect to (cid:12). Let n(cid:12)
i (as in (7.1)) denote the rank of Qi , and let ki denote the number of orbits of
Γ(Qi) on F(Qi). Then the number of orbits of F(P) under the action of Γ(P) is k1k2

(cid:0)n1+n2

(cid:1).

n2

By induction we can now obtain the following corollary

Corollary 7.5. Let P = Q1 (cid:12)Q2,(cid:12) . . . ,(cid:12)Qr with Qi and Qj relatively prime for every i, j ∈ {1, . . . , r}.
i (as in (7.1)) be the rank of Qi and ki denote the number of orbits of Γ(Qi) on F(Qi). Then the

number of orbits of F(P) under the action of Γ(P) is

We now turn our attention to the case when P = Q (cid:12) ··· (cid:12) Q = Qm, where Q is a prime polytope
with respect to (cid:12) and m is a natural number. In this case, the action of Γ(P) = Γ(Q)m (cid:111) Sm on the
elements of B(P) is given by:

({Φ1, . . . , Φm}, (a1, a2, . . . , an))γ = ({Φ1σγ1, . . . , Φmσγm}, (a1σ−1, a2σ−1, . . . , anσ−1).

Note that each a ∈ A can be sent by an element of Γ(P) to m! elements. Indeed, each element of
Sm acts on the second coordinate of the elements of B(P), and the only element of Sn that ﬁxes a given
a ∈ A is the identity. Moreover, only the elements of Sm can permute the second coordinates of the
elements of B. This implies that the action of Sm on A has
(N m)!
(N !)mm! orbits. In particular we note that
this number is always an integer. By now taking into consideration the number of orbits of F(Q) under
the action of Γ(Q), we have the following lemma.
Lemma 7.6. Let P = Q (cid:12) Q (cid:12) ··· (cid:12) Q = Qm for some prime polytope Q with respect to (cid:12). Let N(cid:12)
denote the rank of Q, and k denote the number of orbits of Γ(Q) on F(Q). Then the number of orbits of
F(P) under the action of Γ(P) is

km (N m)!
(N !)mm!

.

We are now ready to compute the number of ﬂag orbits of a product.

Proposition 7.7. Let P = Qm1

number of orbits of F(P) under the action of Γ(P) is

Remark 7.8. Note that in Lemmas 7.4 and 7.6, Corollary 7.5 and Proposition 7.7, we never use the
fact that the posets are strongly connected. Hence similar propositions for pre-polytopes (in the sense of
[11]), and their products as posets hold.

We would like to ﬁnd out when a product of polytopes is a regular or a 2-orbit polytope. We start
by analyzing the case when a product is regular. Then, the number of orbits of Proposition 7.7 has to
equal one.

Start by noticing that

that
implies that P is a prime poset. The second case implies that P = Qm1 , where Q has maximal chains of
size 2.
Theorem 7.9. Let P be a regular polytope. Then, P is prime with respect to all four products except in
the following cases:

1. If P is an n-simplex, then P is not prime with respect to the join product. In fact, P = v (cid:111)(cid:110) v (cid:111)(cid:110)

. . . , (cid:111)(cid:110) v, where v is a 0-polytope.

2. If P is an n-cube, then P is not prime with respect to the cartesian product. In fact, P = e×e×···×e,

where e is a 1-polytope.

3. If P is an n-crosspolytope, then P is not prime with respect to the direct sum.

e ⊕ e ⊕ ··· ⊕ e, where e is a 1-polytope.

In fact, P =

4. If P = Q (cid:3) Q (cid:3) . . . (cid:3) Q, where Q is a 2-polytope, then P is a regular polytope that is not prime

with respect to the topological product.

Proof. Each of the cases follows from the above discussion and by the following facts. In every case P
must be the product of identical copies of prime polytopes (with respect to the given product). The join
product is a product of posets and hence, with the above notation, the size of a maximal chain of the
poset Q coincides with the number of ﬂags of Q as polytope, implying that the rank of P is zero. The
cartesian product and the direct sum taking away one element are products of posets, hence, the size of a
maximal chain of the poset Q is in fact one more than the rank of Q, that is, the rank of P must be one.
Finally, the topological product, when taking away the minimum and maximum elements, is a product
of posets. Hence the rank of Q must in fact coincide with the number of elements in a maximal chain,
when seen as a factor in the product. That is, Q has to be a 2-polytope.

Following a similar analysis we can obtain an analogous theorem for two-orbit polytopes.

Theorem 7.10. Let P be a two-orbit polytope. Then P is prime with respect to the four products, except
in the case where P is a torus {4, 4}(a,0),(0,b). In this case P = Q (cid:3) K, where Q and K are non-isomorphic
2-polytopes, and P is prime with respect to the other four products.

19

Proof. If P is a two-orbit polytope, then k in (7.2) must equal 2. We divide the analysis into two cases,
when r = 1, and when r > 1.
(n!)mm! ∈ N,
(n!)mm! (cid:54)= 1

Suppose ﬁrst that P = Qm, with Q prime. Then, (setting n1 = n) k = km
Suppose now that r > 1. Since ((cid:80)r

(n!)mm! > 2), and in the second case P is simply a prime two-orbit polytope.
i=1(mini)! > 1 and k = 2, we have that ((cid:80)r

(n!)mm! = 2 or k1 = 2 and m = 1. The ﬁrst case can never happen (as

then either k1 = 1 and (mn)!

(n!)mm! . Since (mn)!

and that for every i,
The last equality holds if and only if r = 2 and b1 = b2 = 1. Hence, m1 = m2 = n1 = n2 = 1.
As pointed out before, for the join product, the cartesian product and the direct product, n1 = n2 = 1
implies that Q1 = Q2 and they are either a 0-polytope or a 1-polytope. However, we are under the
assumption that Q1 and Q2 are relatively primes.
Hence, we only have left the case when Q1 and Q2, as polytopes, have rank 2 and they are relatively
prime with respect to (cid:3). Since all rank 2 polytopes are prime with respect to the topological product,
then Q1 and Q2 are only required to be non isomorphic 2-polytopes. This establishes the theorem.

8 Products and monodromy groups

The monodromy groups of an abstract polytope encapsulates all the combinatorial information of the
polytope (see [5],[10]). However, monodromy groups of non-regular abstract polytopes have been proven
hard to understand (see [12]). Here, we study some basic properties of the monodromy group of a product.
To this end, we use the description of the ﬂags of a product given in Section 6. As we have seen
throughout, the four products of polytopes studied in this paper behave very much alike. Here, we give
the details of our proofs only for the join product. The details of the other three products can be recovered
from this one by making small modiﬁcations.
Let P = Q1 (cid:111)(cid:110) Q2 (cid:111)(cid:110) ··· (cid:111)(cid:110) Qr be an (n − 1)-polytope, where n = n1 + ··· + nr and ni − 1 is the rank
of the polytope Qi. For convenience, throughout this section we shall make use of Lemma 6.1, and write
each Φ ∈ F(P) as (Ψ(1), Ψ(2), . . . , Ψ(r), a), where each Ψ(j) ∈ F(Qj) and a ∈ A. (Recall that A is the set
of ordered n-tuples a = (a0, a1, . . . , an−1) with aj ∈ {1, . . . , r} and such that each j ∈ {1, . . . , r} appears
exactly nj times in a.) Hence, we regard the set of ﬂag F(P) and the set F(Q1)×F(Q2)×···×F(Qr)×A
as the same object and use one or the other indistinctly.
Note that we can regard Sn as the permutation group on the symbols {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}, and hence
Sn acts on A in a natural way. That is, given a = (a0, a1, . . . , an−1) ∈ A and α ∈ Sn, then aα =
ni−2 be the generators of the monodromy group M(Qi) := Mi
(a0α, a1α, . . . , a(n−1)α). Let r(i)
j permutes every ﬂag of Qi with its j-adjecent one. Let M := M1 × M2 ×···× Mr.
of Qi. Hence, each r(i)
We shall start by showing that the wreath product W := M (cid:111)A Sn of M by Sn acting on A as described
above, acts on the set F(P) in a faithful way. Recall that if w = ({wb}b∈A, α), v = ({vb}b∈A, β) ∈ W,
then

wv =(cid:0){wbvbα}b∈A, βα(cid:1).

Let Φ = (Ψ(1), Ψ(2), . . . , Ψ(r), a) ∈ F(P) and w = ({wb}b∈A, α) ∈ W. Since for every b ∈ A, we have
b ∈ Mj. Hence, the action on w

It is not diﬃcult to see that (8.1) in fact deﬁnes an action of W on F(P) and that if an element
w = ({wb}b∈A, α) ∈ W ﬁxes every ﬂag of P, then α = 1Sn and for each b ∈ A we have that wb =
(1M1 , 1M2, . . . , 1Mr ), implying that the action is faithful.
Let s0, s1, . . . sn−2 be the generators of the monodromy group of P, M(P). Since each sk permutes
every ﬂag of P with its k-adjacent one, in order to understand M(P) we need to understand the ﬂag
adjacencies in P. Let k ∈ {0, 1, . . . n− 2}. Consider the k-adjacent ﬂag to Φ, Φk. Then we can write Φ =
{Φ−1, Φ0, . . . Φn−3, Φn−2} and Φk = {Φ−1, . . . Φk−1, Λ, Φk+1, . . . , Φn−2}, where each Φi, i = −1, . . . , n− 1
as well as Λ are faces of the product. For each i, we write Φi = (F 1
i ) and Λ = (G1, G2, . . . , Gr).
Using the deﬁnition of the order of the product P, we observe that, for each i, Φi and Φi+1 diﬀer in
exactly one element (in fact, they diﬀer in their a(Φ)
element). Hence, Φk−1 and Φk+1 diﬀer on at most
two elements and on at least one. Our study then naturally splits into two cases: when Φk−1 and Φk+1
diﬀer on one or two elements.

where (Ψ(ak))l is the l-adjacent ﬂag to Ψ(ak), and l is the number of times that ai appears in the sequence
a0, a1, . . . ak−1.

and j1. Then F i

(8.3)
We are now ready to relate the monodromy group of P with the wreath product W. Given (cid:12) ∈ {(cid:111)(cid:110)
,×,⊕, (cid:3)} and P = Q1 (cid:12) Q2 (cid:12) ··· (cid:12) Qr a product polytope, if ni is the rank of the polytope Qi, then we

if (cid:12) = (cid:3).

(8.4)

Proposition 8.1. Let (cid:12) ∈ {(cid:111)(cid:110),×,⊕, (cid:3)}. Given polytopes Q1,Q2, . . . ,Qr and P = Q1 (cid:12) Q2 (cid:12) ··· (cid:12) Qr,
the monodromy group of P, M(P), can be embedded as a subgroup of the wreath product W = M (cid:111)A Sn,
where M is the direct product of the monodromy groups of the Qi and n is as in (8.4). Moreover the
projection on the second factor π|M(P) : M(P) → Sn is surjective.
Proof. We give a proof for when (cid:12) =(cid:111)(cid:110), the other three cases are similar. Since we know that W acts
faithfully on F(P), to settle the ﬁrst part of the proposition, it is enough to show that we can embed
each of the generators of M(P) in W.

straightforward to see that for every Φ ∈ F, Φwk = Φk. Hence each generator of M(P) can be embedded
into W, implying that M(P) can be embedded as a subgroup of the wreath product W.

Since π(wk) = (k, k + 1) ∈ Sn, the second part of the proposition follows.

group of P is an extension of a symmetric group Sn, where n is as in (8.4).

This corollary tells us that the monodromy group of a product is always an extension of a symmetric
group. However, this extension does not always splits, and ﬁguring out when it does is not always easy
or straightforward. In what follows we show how can this be computed in some simple examples. For
the remainder of this section, we let π : W → Sn be the natural projection and K be the kernel of the
restriction of π to M(Q1 (cid:12) Q2 (cid:12) ··· (cid:12) Qr).

8.1 On the monodromy group of pyramids
Let P be an n-polytope and consider its pyramid Pyr(P) = P (cid:111)(cid:110) v. Let Sn+2 denote the symmetric group
on the symbols 0, 1, . . . , n + 1, and for i = 0, . . . , n + 1, let σi = (i, i + 1) ∈ Sn+2. The set A is the set
{e0, e1, . . . , en+1}, where ei is the vector with n + 2 entires such that the entire (i + 1) is 2 and the rest
of them are 1. Since v is a 0-polytope, its monodormy group is trivial. Hence M(Pyr(P)) is embedded
as a subgroup of the wreath product W = M(P) (cid:111)A Sn+1.
Let r0, . . . , rn−1 be the generators of M(P). Following the proof of Proposition 8.1, we can see that
the generators s0, . . . , sn of M(Pyr(P)) can be regarded as:

si = (ri−1, . . . , ri−1, 1, 1, ri . . . , ri, σi) ∈ W,

(8.5)

where the identity element 1 of M(P) is in the (i + 1) and (i + 2) entries.

Observe that for each i ∈ {0, . . . , n − 2},

(sisi+1)3 = ((ri−1ri)3, . . . , (ri−1ri)3, 1, 1, 1, (riri+1)3, . . . , (riri+1)3, ),

where the identity element 1 of M(P) is in the (i + 1), (i + 2) and (i + 3) entries and  denotes the
identity of Sn+1. Hence, the order of sisi+1 is lcm[3, pi−1, pi], the largest common multiple of 3, pi and
pi−1, where pj is the order of rjrj+1 in M(P).
Computing the kernel K of the restriction of the projection π : W → Sn+2 to M(P) is rather diﬃcult
in general. One can use similar techniques to the ones we shall use in Section 8.2 to show that when
P is a p-gon (that is, the simplest case of the pyramid) then K ∼= (Cm)4, where m =
gcd(3,p) . Hence,
the monodromy group is an extension of S4 by (Cm)4. Moreover, the extension splits if and only if p is
not congruent to 0 modulo 9. We do not give the details of this here, as this group has been previously
computed in [2].

8.2 On the monodromy group of prisms
Let P be an n-polytope and consider its prism Pri(P) = P × e. We start by making some general remarks
about Pri(P) to exemplify how the above discussion would apply to one example in the cartesian product,
and then proceed to compute the monodromy group of the prism over a polygon as an extension of S3.
Let Sn+1 denote the symmetric group on the symbols 1, . . . , n + 1, let  denote the identity of Sn+1
and for i = 1, . . . , n, let σi = (i, i + 1) ∈ Sn+1. The set A is the set {e1, e2, . . . , en+1}, where ei is the
vector with n + 1 entries such that the entry i is 2 and the rest of them are 1. Since e is a 1-polytope,
its monodromy group is a cyclic group of order 2. We let t denote its generator. And let r0, . . . , rn−1 be
the generators of M(P).
By Proposition 8.1, M(Pri(P)) can be embedded in W = (M(P)×C2)(cid:111)A Sn+1. Note that in this case,
the i-adjacency of the ﬂags of Pri(P) is not described anymore by (8.2) and (8.3). Let Φ = (Ψ, Λ, a) be
a ﬂag of Pri(P), where Ψ ∈ F(P), Λ ∈ F(e) and a ∈ A. Then, the 0-adjacency of a ﬂag Φ is determined
only by the value of the ﬁrst entry of a.

(cid:26) (Ψ0, Λ, a)

(Ψ, Λ0, a)

Φ0 =

if a (cid:54)= e1;
if a = e1.

For i > 0, the i-adjacency is similar as that in (8.2) and (8.3). There is a small modiﬁcation that has to
be done, obtaining that,

Φi =

of M(Pri(P)), then

Hence, using this to modify the ideas of the proof of Proposition 8.1, if s0, . . . , sn denote the generators

s0 = (cid:0)(1, t), (r0, 1), (r0, 1), . . . , (r0, 1), (cid:1),
si = (cid:0)(ri−1, 1), . . . , (ri−1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (ri, 1) . . . , (ri, 1), σi

(cid:1), if i > 0,

(8.6)

where the identity element 1 of M(P) is in the i and (i + 1) entries.
Computing the kernel K is not always easy and depends on the monodromy group of P. In what
follows, we compute K, whenever P is a p-gon, that is, Pri(P) is simply the prism over a polygon. In [6]
the monodromy groups of prisms over polygons were computed in terms of generators and relations. Here,
we also have the generators and can infer the relations of the group, but we shall focus on computing
such group as a split extension of S3.
Let P be a p-gon, and let Q be the prism over P, that is Q = Pri(P). By Proposition 8.1,
M(Q) can be embedded into the wreath product W = M (cid:111)A S3, where M = M(P) × C2 and A =
{(2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (1, 1, 2)}. Hence, M(Q) is in fact an extension of S3 by the group K, the kernel of the
restriction of π : W → S3 to M(Q). Furthermore, the generators in (8.6) become:

We start by noticing that s1s2 has order 3. Moreover, observe that

s0 = (cid:0)(1, t), (r0, 1), (r0, 1), (cid:1),
s1 = (cid:0)(1, 1), (1, 1), (r1, 1), σ1
(cid:1),
(cid:1).
s2 = (cid:0)(r1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), σ2
s0s1 =(cid:0)(1, t), (r0, 1), (r0r1, 1), σ1
(cid:1),

23

and hence

(s0s1)2 =(cid:0)(r0, t), (r0, t), ((r0r1)2, 1), (cid:1).
s2(s0s1)2s2 =(cid:0)(r1r0r1, t), ((r0r1)2, 1), (r0, t), (cid:1).

From here is straightforward to see that the order of s0s1 is 4m, where m =

p

gcd(p,4) Moreover,

and so (s0s1)2, s2(s0s1)2s2 ∈ K. In fact, it is not too diﬃcult to see that s0, (s0s1)2 and s2(s0s1)2s2
generate K.
b := (s0s1)2, c := s2bs2 and d := s1cs1. Hence, K = (cid:104)a, b, c(cid:105) and d = abac ∈ K. Observe that

We now study the structure of the group K. In order to slightly simplify our notation, we let a := s0,

b2 = (cid:0)(1, 1), (1, 1), ((r0r1)4, 1), (cid:1);
c2 = (cid:0)(1, 1), ((r0r1)4, 1), (1, 1), (cid:1);
d2 = (cid:0)((r0r1)4, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (cid:1).

Hence, the group H = (cid:104)b2, c2, d2(cid:105) < K is isomorphic to (Cm)3 (this group H actually coincides with
It is straightforward to see (using the description of the generators
the group H in [6, Section 6]).
as elements of W) that H is normal in K. Moreover, the elements of the quotient K/H are simply
{H, aH, bH, cH, abH, acH, bcH, abcH}, implying that K/H ∼= (C2)3. In other words, K is an extension
of (C2)3 by (Cm)3.
Whenever m is odd (that is, if p is diﬀerent than 0 mod 8), then a, bm, cm /∈ K \ H generate the (C2)3,
implying that the extension splits. Otherwise, there are no elements of K \ H that generate the (C2)3
and the extension does not split. Hence, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 8.3. Let Q be the prism over a p-gon. Then, M(Q) ∼= K (cid:111) S3, where K is an extension
of (C2)3 by (Cm)3, with m =
gcd(p,4) . Furthermore, this extension splits whenever p is not congruent to
0 modulo 8. In this case,

p

M(Q) ∼=(cid:0)(C2)3 (cid:111) (Cm)3(cid:1) (cid:111) S3.

Once we know the structure of the monodromy group of prisms over polygons, we consider prisms
over some 3-polytopes. Let p be an integer, and P be a 3-polytope such that all its vertex ﬁgures are
isomorphic to p-gons (these polytopes are sometimes called uniform maps, however, the notation is not
standard as uniform in other contexts means that the polytope is vertex-transitive). Consider the prism
over P. Then, the generators of M(Pri(P)) are

s0 =(cid:0)(1, t), (r0, 1), (r0, 1), (r0, 1), (cid:1),
(cid:1),
s2 =(cid:0)(r1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (r2, 1), σ2

s1 =(cid:0)(1, 1), (1, 1), (r1, 1), (r1, 1), σ1
s3 =(cid:0)(r2, 1), (r2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), σ3

(cid:1),
(cid:1).

Note that (cid:104)s1, s2, s3(cid:105) is isomorphic to the monodromy group of the pyramid over a p-gon. Although this
suggests that computing the kernel K and hence knowing the structure of the monodromy group of the
prism is easy (as we have already done the work for the pyramid), this is far from true. The reason for
this is that now s0 ∈ K, so ﬁnding the generators of K is not easy. It is true, however, that K contains a
)4 and that the extension of S4 by K splits whenever p is not 0
normal subgroup isomorphic to (C p
modulo 9 (since the elements we need to use to recover S4 in M(Pri(P)) are the same as the ones needed
in the pyramid). In other words, we have the following proposition.
Proposition 8.4. Let P be a 3-polytope such that all its vertex-ﬁgures are isomorphic to a p-gon. Then
the monodromy group of Pri(P), the prism over P, is a split extension of S4 by some normal group
whenever p is not congruent to 0 modulo 9.

8.3 On the monodromy group of topological products with a polygon
Let P be an n-polytope, and consider (cid:3)P := P(cid:3)Q, where Q is a p-gon. Note that (cid:3)P has rank n + 1.
The analysis of M((cid:3)P ) is very similar to that of Pri(P). The two main diﬀerences are that M((cid:3)P ) is
now an extension of Sn (as opposed to Sn+1), and that the generators s0 and sn of M((cid:3)P ) are now

s0 =(cid:0)(1, t0), (r0, 1), (r0, 1), . . . , (r0, 1), (cid:1),
sn =(cid:0)(1, t1), (rn−1, 1), (rn−1, 1), . . . , (rn−1, 1), (cid:1),

where t0, t1 are the generators of M(Q) and r0, . . . rn−1 are the generators of M(P).
a q-gon, is rather simple. In this case, n = 2, so M(P(cid:3)Q) is a split extension of S2 by K. Moreover,

Again, computing in general K is not easy in general. However, whenever P is also a 2-polytope, say

s0 =(cid:0)(1, t0), (r0, 1), (cid:1), s1 =(cid:0)(1, 1), (1, 1), σ1

(cid:1), s2 =(cid:0)(1, t1), (r1, 1), (cid:1).

and

s1s0s1 =(cid:0)(r0, 1), (1, t0), (cid:1), s1s2s1 =(cid:0)(r1, 1), (1, t1), (cid:1).

Hence, the kernel K is generated by s0, s2, s1s0s1 and s1s2s1. A simple computation shows then that
(cid:104)s0, s1s2s1(cid:105) ∼= (cid:104)s2, s1s0s1(cid:105) ∼= Dm, where m = [p, q] is the least common multiple of p and q. Moreover, it
is straightforward to see that these two groups commute implying that K = (Dm)2 and

M(P(cid:3)Q) = (Dm)2 (cid:111) S2.

In fact, it is not diﬃcult to extend these techniques to show that, if Qi is a pi-gon, then

M(Q1(cid:3)Q2(cid:3) . . . (cid:3)Qr) ∼= (Dp)r (cid:111) Sr,

where p is the least common multiple of p1, . . . pr.
We note here that this result is not surprising at all, since the monodromy group of a polytope P is
isomorphic to the minimal regular cover of P, whenever such cover is unique (see for example [6]). It is
easy to see that the minimal regular cover of Q1(cid:3)Q2(cid:3) . . . (cid:3)Qr is the regular polytope Qr, where Q is a
p-gon (p = lcm[p1, . . . , pr]) and the power is taken over the (cid:3)-product.

Conlcuding remarks

As we have pointed out before, computing the monodromy group of non-regular polytopes is a diﬃcult
task. In this paper we showed that by regarding some polytopes as products this task can be simpliﬁed.
In particular we think that the computations needed to calculate the monodromy groups of prisms and
pyramids over polygons are fairly easy, specially if one compares them to those of [2] and [6]. For this
reason we strongly believe that the techniques used here can be extended in order to compute monodromy
groups of other interesting products and think it is an interesting project to pursue.
