Abstract

This paper revisits the variational theory of traﬃc ﬂow, now under the presence of continuum
lateral inﬂows and outﬂows to the freeway say Eulerian source terms. It is found that a VT
solution exists only in Eulerian coordinates when source terms are exogenous meaning that they
only depend on time and space, but not when they are a function of traﬃc conditions, as per a
merge model. In discrete time, however, these dependencies become exogenous, which allowed
us to propose improved numerical solution methods. In Lagrangian and vehicle number-space
coordinates, VT solutions may not exist even if source terms are exogenous.

Keywords:

traﬃc ﬂow, source terms, kinematic wave model

1. Introduction

The variational theory (VT) applied in traﬃc ﬂow theory (Daganzo, 2005a,b) was an im-
portant milestone. Previously, the only analytical solution to the kinematic wave model of
Lighthill and Whitham (1955); Richards (1956) was the method of characteristics, which does
not give a global solution in time as one needs to keep track of characteristics crossings (shocks
and rarefaction waves ) and impose entropy conditions to ensure uniqueness. This means that
analytical solutions cannot be formulated except for very simple problems.

In contrast, VT makes use of the link between conservation laws and the Hamilton-Jacobi
partial diﬀerential equation (HJ PDE), allowing the kinematic wave model to be solved using
the Hopf-Lax formula (Lax, 1957; Olejnik, 1957; Hopf, 1970), better known in transportation
as Newell’s minimum principle Newell (1993) whenever the fundamental diagram or Hamil-
tonian is piecewise linear. The big advantage is that this representation formula gives an
analytical global solution in time that does not require explicit consideration of shocks and/or
entropy conditions. Moreover, current approximation methods for the Macroscopic Fundamen-
tal Diagram (MFD) of urban networks rely on this approach (Daganzo and Geroliminis, 2008;
Geroliminis and Boyacı, 2013; Leclercq and Geroliminis, 2013; Laval and Castrillon, 2015). In
addition, when the ﬂow-density fundamental diagram is triangular (or piecewise linear more
generally), numerical solutions become exact in the HJ framework, and this is not the case in
the conservation law approach (LeVeque, 1993). It has also been shown that the traﬃc ﬂow
problem cast in Lagrangian or vehicle number-space coordinates also accepts a VT solution,
which can be used to obtain very eﬃcient numerical solution methods Leclercq et al. (2007);
Laval and Leclercq (2013).

The traﬃc ﬂow problem with source term is also of great interest; e.g., it can be used to
approximate (i) long freeways with closely spaced entrances and exits, (ii) the eﬀect of lane-
changing activity on a single lane, or (iii) the eﬀects of turning movements, trip generation
and trip ends in the MFD. But the underlying assumption in the previous paragraphs is that
vehicles are conserved. This begs the twofold question, are representation formulas for the
VT solutions still valid, or even applicable, when there is a Eulerian source term? If not, can
eﬃcient numerical solution methods still be implemented? Recent developments in this area
have not answered these questions as they are primarily concerned with discrete source terms
(e.g., Daganzo, 2014; Costeseque and Lebacque, 2014a,b).

To answer these questions this paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we formulate the
general problem and show that in general VT solutions are not applicable; but section 3 shows
that they are when the source term is exogenous. Based on these results, section 4 presents
numerical methods for the endogenous inﬂow problem that outperform existing methods. Sec-
tion 5 brieﬂy shows that in space-Lagrangian and time-Lagrangian coordinates VT solutions do
not exist even if source terms are exogenous. A discussion of results and outlook is presented
in section 6.

2. Problem Formulation

Consider a long homogeneous freeway corridor with a large number of entrances and exits
such that the net lateral freeway inﬂow rate, φ, or inﬂow for short, can be treated as a continuum
variable in time t≥ 0 and location x∈ R, and has units of veh/time-distance. The inﬂow is an
endogenous variable consequence of the demand for travel, and could be captured by a function
of the traﬃc states both in the freeway and the ramps. For simplicity, in this paper the inﬂow
is assumed to be a function of the density, k(t, x), of the freeway only, i.e. φ = φ(k(t, x)), but
also the exogenous case φ = φ(t, x) will be of interest.

In any case, the traﬃc ﬂow problem analyzed in this paper is the following conservation law

with source term:

kt + H(k)x = φ,
k = g

on Γ

(1a)
(1b)

where H is the fundamental diagram, g is the data deﬁned on a boundary Γ, and variables in
subscript represent partial derivatives. Now we deﬁne the function N(t, x) such that:

Nx = − k say N(t, x) := Z +∞

x

k(t, y)dy,

and integrate (1) with respect to x to obtain its HJ form (Evans, 1998):

Nt − H(−Nx) = Φ,

N = G on Γ,

where we have deﬁned:

G(t, x) = IΓ
Φ(t, x) = −Z x

0

g(t, x)dΓ,

φ(t, y)dy

(t, x) ∈ Γ,

and

(2)

(3a)
(3b)

(4a)

(4b)

where Φ is a potential function; the negative sign in (4b) follows from the traditional counting
convention in traﬃc ﬂow, where further downstream vehicles have lower vehicle numbers.

It is important to note that compared to the traditional case with zero inﬂow, under a
continuum source term the interpretation of N changes: for ﬁxed x it still deﬁnes a cumulative
count curve due to (2) but its isometrics do no longer give vehicle trajectories. To see this we
note that according to (3a) the ﬂow q = H(k) is now:

q = Nt − Φ,

(5)

arbitrary constant, by ˜N(t, x) + R t
0 R x
0 φ(s, y)dsdy, where ˜N(t, x) := R t

The time integration of (5) reveals that cumulative count curves are now given, up to an
0 q(s, x)ds denotes the
usual N-curve without source terms and the integral represents the net number of vehicles
entering (φ > 0) or exiting (φ < 0) the road segment by time t and upstream of x.

The method to obtain the solution of (3) depends on the dependencies of the potential
function. If the inﬂow function is allowed to depend on the traﬃc state in the freeway, i.e.
φ = φ(k) then the potential function Φ depends non-locally on N, since:

Φ(t, x) = ˜Φ(N, x) = −Z x

0

φ(−Nx(t, y))dy,

(6)

and therefore it is not obvious that (3) accepts a representation formula as a VT solution. To
see this, we note that even in the simplest linear case:

φ(k) = a − bk,

a, b ≥ 0, we get:

˜Φ(N, x) = −ax +(cid:18)Z x

0

k(t, y) dy(cid:19) b = −ax − (N(t, x) − c)b,

(7a)

(7b)

0

where c= R +∞

k(t, y)dy = N(t, 0) is an arbitrary constant of integration. This means that (3)
becomes the more general HJ equation Nt − ˜H(x, N, −Nx) = 0, where ˜H is the Hamiltonian.
The Hamiltonian’s N-dependency is what complicates matters. Barron et al. (1996); Barron
(2015) show that a Hopf-Lax type solution exists in this case only when (among other assump-
tions) a = 0 i.e. ˜H(x, u, p) = ˆH(u, p) where ˆH does not depend on the space variable and ˜H
is homogeneous of degree one with respect to Nx, which is of no use in traﬃc ﬂow since in
practice it means that the Hamiltonian has to be monotone linear. As explained in section 5,
we argue that this N-dependency prevents formulating an equivalent VT problem (such as (8)
below) that can be solved with variational methods.

As shown in the next section, it turns out that when inﬂows are exogenous a global VT
solution can still be identiﬁed, albeit not in Hopf-Lax form because optimal paths are no longer
straight lines.

3. Exogenous inﬂow

3.1. Setting of the VT problem

The results in this section are based on VT (Daganzo, 2005a), where the solution of the HJ
equation Nt − ˜H(t, x, −Nx) = 0 is given by the solution of the following variational problem:

N(P ) =

min

B∈ΓP , ξ∈VBP

f (B, ξ) = G(B) +Z t

tB

f (B, ξ), with

R(s, ξ(s), ξ′(s)) ds

3

(8a)

(8b)

where P is a generic point with coordinates (t, x), B ≡ (tB, y) is a point in the boundary ΓP ,
ξ is a member of the set of all valid paths between B and P denoted VBP , and ξ(tB) = y; see
Fig. 1a. The function R(·) gives the maximum passing rates along the observer and corresponds
to the (concave) Legendre transform of ˜H, i.e.,

R(t, x, v) = sup

k n ˜H(t, x, k) − vko .

It is worth mentioning that in the simplest homogeneous case where ˜H = H(k) the VT

solution (8) becomes the Hopf-Lax formula:

N(P ) = min

B∈ΓP (cid:26)G(B) + (t − tB)R(cid:18) x − y

t − tB(cid:19)(cid:27) ,

(9)

where the minimization over ξ(t) is no longer necessary since characteristics become straight
lines in this case. Unfortunately, even the presence of exogenous lateral inﬂows that vary in
time or space make characteristics not to be straight lines and therefore a Hopf-Lax type solu-
tion cannot be devised. A VT solution, however, still exists as shown next.

We now formulate VT solution to account for source terms explicitly. In the remaining of

speed u, wave speed −w (with w > 0) and jam density κ such that

H(k) = min {uk , w(κ − k)}

for any k ∈ [0, κ].

(10)

It follows that the capacity is Q = κwu/(w + u) and the critical density K = Q/u.

When the potential function is exogenous, i.e. Φ = Φ(t, x), the Hamiltonian can be written
as the sum of the fundamental diagram and the potential function, i.e.: ˜H(t, x, k) = H(k) +
Φ(t, x). In the case of a triangular fundamental diagram we have R(t, x, v) = Q − Kv + Φ(t, x)
with v ∈ [−w, u], and the function f (B, ξ) to be minimized reads:

Φ(s, ξ(s)) ds

(11)

f (B, ξ) = G(B) + (t − tB)Q − (x − y)K +Z t

The J-integral in (11) is what separates this problem from the problems studied so far in traﬃc
ﬂow using VT principles. This integral in terms of φ is:

J = −Z t

tB Z ξ(s)

y

φ(s, x) dxds,

(12)

and represents the net number of vehicles leaving the area below the curve x = ξ(t), namely
area A(ξ); see Fig. 1b. Therefore, minimizing J given y = ξ(tB), can be interpreted as ﬁnding
ξ(t) that maximizes the net number of vehicles entering A(ξ).

3.2. Initial value problems

In the initial value problem (IVP) the boundary Γ is the line {tB = 0} ×R, so that the

problem here is (3a) supplemented with:

N(0, x) = G(x),

(13)

4

where we assume that G ∈ C 2(R). The candidate set for B, ΓP is reduced to B’s x-coordinate,
y, which is delimited by two points U = (0, xU ) and D = (0, xD), where:

xU = x − ut, and xD = x + wt,
xU < y < xD

(14a)
(14b)

see Fig. 1a. The following subsections examine simpliﬁed versions of this problem that reveal
considerable insight into the general solution.

3.2.1. Constant inﬂow

Consider the IVP with constant inﬂow problem:

φ(t, x) = a,

(15)

for some a ∈ R \ {0}. It follows from (12) that J = −aA(ξ) and therefore, for a ﬁxed y = ξ(0)
the minimum of (11) is obtained by a path that: (i) maximizes A(ξ) when a > 0; or (ii)
minimizes A(ξ) when a < 0. These two optimum paths are the extreme paths in VBP that
deﬁne its boundary; see “upper” and “lower” paths in Fig. 2a. This solution is a “bang-bang”
solution, typical for this type optimal control problems. The reader can verify that the areas
under these paths are given by A(y, xD) and A(y, xU ), respectively, where we have deﬁned:

A(y, x−) =

1

2 (cid:18)(x + x−)t − sign(a)

(x− − y) 2

u + w (cid:19)

(16)

where sign(a) is the sign of a and x− is a placeholder for xD if a > 0 or xU if a < 0. Thus the
optimization problem has been reduced to a single variable, y, whose ﬁrst- and second-order
conditions for a minimum y∗ read:

f ′(y∗) = ψ (y∗ − x−) + G′(y∗) + K = 0,
f ′′(y∗) = ψ + G′′(y∗) > 0, where:

ψ :=

|a|

u + w

,

where | · | denotes the absolute value. Notice that ψ > 0 as long as a 6= 0.
Of course, the optimal point y∗ needs to satisfy (14b): xU ≤ y∗ ≤ xD.

3.2.2. Constant initial density

Here, in addition to φ(t, x) = a, we assume

g(x) = k0,

−∞ < x < ∞

which implies that the function to minimize is a parabola:

f (y) = −c0 − c1y +

−−sign(a) (x− + x) (u + w)t(cid:3) and c1 = ψx− − (K − k0), and

5

(20)

Notice that (17b) is always satisﬁed in this case and therefore y∗ is always a minimum and
should be included so long as xU ≤ y∗ ≤ xD. Combining this with (20) gives that the ﬁnal
solution can be expressed as:

N(t, x) = (cid:26)f (y∗),

min{f (xU ), f (xD)},

t > (K − k0)/a > 0
otherwise

(21a)
(21b)

Notice that (K − k0)/a represents the time it takes for the system to reach critical density,
namely “time-to-capacity”. This means that y∗ will be the optimal candidate only once a
regime transition occurs. This will happen only if the time to capacity is positive, i.e. when
sign(a) = sign(K − k0) or more explicitly, when k0 is under-critical and φ is an inﬂow (a
positive) or when k0 is over-critical and φ is an outﬂow (a negative).

Somewhat unexpectedly, we note that −fx(xU ) = −fx(xD) = −fx(y∗) = k0 + at, which
means that the density is always given by the traveling wave k(t, x) = k0 + at, which is also
the solution of (1) in this case using the method of characteristics. One should also impose
feasibility conditions for the density, i.e. 0 ≤ k ≤ κ, which gives:

k(t, x) = 


0,
κ,
k0 + at,

t > −k0/a, a < 0
t > (κ − k0)/a, a > 0
otherwise

(22a)
(22b)
(22c)

The ﬂow can be obtained using (5), but it is equivalent and simpler to use q = H(k).

3.2.3. Extended Riemann problems

Riemann problems are the building blocks of Godunov-type numerical solution methods.
As illustrated in Fig. 2b, in these problems one is interested in the value of N at x = x0 ≥ ut,
i.e. at point P = (t, x0), with initial data typically given by the density at t = 0. This is
a very special case for with the ‘target’ point P is located on the discontinuity of the initial
data at x = x0. However the methodology below can be easily extended to the cases where
P = (t, x) with x < x0 or x > x0. Here, we extend the initial data to include the inﬂow:

(g(x), φ(x)) = (cid:26)(kU , aU ),

(kD, aD),

x ≤ x0
x > x0,

(23a)
(23b)

which in conjunction with (3) deﬁne an extended Riemann problem, or ERP for short. We
assume that (aU , aD) 6= (0, 0). Notice that now:

xU = x0 − ut, and xD = x0 + wt.

For simplicity and without loss of generality we set G(x0) = 0, which implies:

G(x) = (cid:26)(x0 − x)kU ,

(x0 − x)kD,

x ≤ x0
x > x0

It will be convenient to deﬁne:

η = aU /aD,

ψ =

aD

u + w

,

θ = u/w.

6

(24)

(25a)
(25b)

(26)

The J-integral in this case is a weighted average of the portion of A(ξ) upstream and down-
stream of x = x0, weighted by aU and aD, respectively. For instance, if ξ(t) > 0 for all t, we
0 ξ(t) − x0dt),
0 ξ(t) − x0dt is the portion of A(ξ)

have J = −R t
where x0t is the portion of A(ξ) upstream of x = x0 and R t

0 (aU x0 + aD(ξ(t) − x0))dt = −(aU x0t + aDR t

downstream of x = x0 in this particular case.

φ(x) dxdt = −R t

0 R ξ(t)

0

It follows that the minimization of the J(ξ) can be achieved analogously to the previous
section by considering the upper and lower paths from each candidate y = ξ(0). In addition,
however, one has to include 2 middle “paths” that would reach and stay at x = x0 until reaching
P ; see Fig. 2b. To formalize, let j1, j2 and j3 be the value of J(ξ) when y ≥ x0 along the upper,
lower and middle paths, respectively; similarly for j4, j5 and j6 when y ≤ x0. Calculating the
areas upstream and downstream of x = x0 deﬁned by each path, it can be shown that the ji’s
can be obtained from:

2(j1(y) − J0)/ψ = −θt2w2(2η(θ + 1) + 1) + 2twy0 + y2
0,
2(j2(y) − J0)/ψ = −ηθ(2θ + 1)t2w2 + 2ηθtwy0 + y2

2(j4(y) − J0)/ψ = −θt2w2(2η(θ + 1) + 1) + 2twy0 + y2

2(j3(y) − J0)/ψ = −(θ + 1)(cid:0)2ηθt2w2 + y2
0(cid:1) ,
2(j5(y) − J0)/ψ = −η(cid:0)θ(2θ + 1)t2w2 − 2θtwy0 + y2
0(cid:1) ,
2(j6(y) − J0)/ψ = η(θ + 1)(cid:0)y2

0 − 2θ2t2w2(cid:1) /θ,

0((η − 1)θ − 1),

0(ηθ + η − 1)/θ,

(27a)
(27b)

(27c)
(27d)

(27e)

(27f)

where y0 = x0 −y and J0 is a constant of our problem that represents the net number of vehicles
leaving the area upstream of xU , i.e. −aU xU t in this case. Notice that j1(x0) = j4(x0), j2(x0) =
j5(x0) and j3(x0) = j6(x0), as expected. The function to minimize in this case can be written
as:

f (y) = G(y) + tQ − (x0 − y)K + J(y), where:

J(y) = (cid:26) min{j1(y), j2(y), j3(y)},

min{j4(y), j5(y), j6(y)},

y > x0
y ≤ x0

(28)

(29a)
(29b)

The solution of (3) under these conditions can be reduced to the evaluation of f (y) at a small
number of candidates. In addition to candidates y = xU and y = xD, we have to consider the
discontinuity at y = x0 and the possible minima produced by each of the components in (27).
Since f (y) is piecewise quadratic, each one of these components has at most one minimum,
namely y = yi, i = 1, . . . 6, which can be obtained by solving the ﬁrst-order conditions f (yi) = 0
associated with each of the ji’s; i.e.:

y1 = xD − (K − kD)/ψ,

y2 = x0 +

y3 = x0 +

K − kD
(θ + 1)ψ

,

y4 = x0 +

y5 = xU + (K − kU )/(ηψ),

y6 = x0 +

θ(η − 1) − 1

xU + θ(K − kU )/ψ

1 − η(1 + θ)

,

,

θ (kU − K)
η(θ + 1)ψ

,

For the yi’s to be valid candidates they must meet the following conditions:

x0 < yi < xD,
xU < yi < x0,

i = 1, 2, 3
i = 4, 5, 6

7

(30a)

(30b)

(30c)

(31a)
(31b)

which ensure that yi is on the boundary ΓP . With all, the sought solution can be expressed as:

N(t, x0) = min
y∈Y

f (y), with: Y = {xU , x0, xD, y∗

1, . . . y∗
6}

(32)

where y∗
is yi if (31) is met and null otherwise. Notice that this solution method does not
i
require imposing f ′′(y∗) > 0 because maxima will be automatically discarded in the minimum
operation.

The average ﬂow ¯q(t, x0) during (0, t) can be obtained as follows:

¯q(t, x0) =

1

t Z t

Nt(s, x0) − Φ(s, x0) ds =

(N(t, x0) − (J0 + xU aU )t) = N(t, x0)/t − J0 − xU aU .

(33a)

(33b)

As shown in Section 4, this formula allows to formulate improved numerical solution methods

for the endogenous problem.

3.3. Initial and boundary value problem

We restrict the space to a segment of road [ξ, χ] with ξ < χ. In the initial and boundary

value problem (IBVP) the boundary Γ is the set deﬁned as

({tB = 0} × [ξ, χ]) ∪ ((0, +∞) × {x = ξ}) ∪ ((0, +∞) × {x = χ}) ,

so that the problem here is (3a) supplemented with:

N(0, x) = Gini(x),
N(t, ξ) = Gup(t),
N(t, χ) = Gdown(t),

on [ξ, χ],
on (0, +∞),
on (0, +∞).

(34)




For obvious compatibility reasons, we request these conditions to satisfy

Gini(ξ) = Gup(0) and Gini(χ) = Gdown(0).

We also consider a a 6= 0 and k0 ∈ [0, κ] such that the inﬂow rate is given by

ϕ(t, x) = a,

for any (t, x) ∈ [0, +∞) × [ξ, χ]

and the initial density

gini(x) = k0,

for any x ∈ [ξ, χ].

According to the position of point P = (t, x) with t > 0 and x ∈ (ξ, χ), we have the following

cases to distinguish (in the spirit of Jin (2015))

To be continued but the idea is that in Region I, everything is exactly the same than in
previous Subsection 3.2 while in the other cases, we will compare initial data Gini coming
from (tD, xD) with upstream data Gup coming from (tU , xU ) (Region II), initial data Gini from
(tU , xU ) with downstream data Gdown from (tD, xD) (Region III) and ﬁnally upstream data Gup
from (tU , xU ) and downstream data Gdown from (tD, xD) (Region IV). I feel that everything can
be done exactly in the same way and ﬁnally the idea is to use the inf-morphism from Aubin,
Bayen, Saint-Pierre (2006)

N(t, x) = min {Nini(t, x) , Nup(t, x) , Ndown(t, x)} .

4. Numerical solution methods

In the following two subsections we formulate two numerical solution methods to ﬁnd the
global solution of the endogenous inﬂow problem in conservation law form (1), (7) and in HJ
form (3), (7), respectively. The basic idea is that in discrete time, if the (endogenous) inﬂows
are computed using the traﬃc states from the previous time step using an explicit-in-time
numerical scheme, then they become exogenous for the current time step and therefore the VT
solution may be applied.

4.1. Godunov’s method

This method has been traditionally used to solve the traﬃc problem in conservation law
form without inﬂows, and constitutes the basis of the well known Cell Transmission (CT) model
(Daganzo, 1994) assuming the triangular Hamiltonian (10). In this method, time and space
are discretized in increments ∆t and ∆x = u∆t, respectively, and we let:

kj
i = k(j∆t, i∆x)

(35)

be the numerical approximation of the density. The update scheme is the following discrete
approximation of the conservation law (1):

kj
i+1 − kj

i

∆t

+

qj+1
i − qj

i

∆x

= φ(kj
i )

(36)

The key to Godunov’s method is the computation of the ﬂow into cell i, qj
i , which are obtained
by solving Riemann problems. Traditionally, inﬂows have been considered explicitly only in

9

the update scheme (36) but not in the solution of the Riemann problems (Laval and Leclercq,
2010). This implies that the computation of qj

i corresponds to the original CT rule:

qj
i = min{Q, ukj

i , (κ − kj+1

i

)w},

(CT rule)

(37)

Here, we will compare the CT rule with the ERP rule (33b), i.e. the ﬂow based on extended
Riemann problems. Both methods are ﬁrst-order accurate since both are Godunov-type meth-
ods, and therefore the rate of convergence of both methods should be similar and roughly
proportional to the mesh size. The main diﬀerence is in the magnitude of the error, where the
ERP rule should be more accurate because the impacts of inﬂows are explicitly considered in
the solution of Riemann problems. We illustrate this with the following example.

Example. Consider an empty freeway at t = 0 subject to an inﬂow linear in both x and k;

i.e.:

g(x) = 0,
φ(k) = ax − buk,

a, b > 0.

(38a)
(38b)

Notice that (Laval and Leclercq, 2010) showed that linear inﬂow functions arise in the contin-
uum approximation of the Newell-Daganzo merge model (Newell, 1982; Daganzo, 1994), which
accounts for the interactions between freeway and on-ramp demands. The particular coeﬃ-
cients of the linear function depend upon the state of the freeway and on-ramps. In particular,
(38b) corresponds to the case where both are in free-ﬂow, ax represent the inﬂow demand
rate at x and b the exit probability per unit distance. Using the method of characteristics
(Laval and Leclercq, 2010) showed that the solution of (1), (38) is :

k(t, x) =

a

b2u(cid:0)bx − 1 + (1 − b(x − tu))e−btu(cid:1)

(39)

provided k(t, x) ≤ K. To get an idea of the solution for all densities, Fig. 3 shows the numerical
ERP solution with ∆t = 1 s, with parameters given in its caption. Notice that similarly to
Laval and Leclercq (2010) we chose θ = 1 to avoid the numerical errors intrinsic to Godunov’s
method and to focus on those caused by the treatment of the inﬂow.

Fig. 4 compares the CT-rule with the ERP-rule numerical solution (with ∆t = 40 s) for
this example vis-a-vis the exact solution (39). Parts (a) and (b) show the time evolution of
the density and ﬂow, respectively, at x = 14 km obtained with each method. It can be seen
that the main diﬀerence, as expected, is in the ﬂow estimates, particularly at t = 0 where the
CT rule predicts zero ﬂow since the freeway is empty and it does not consider inﬂows in its
calculations.

To assess the accuracy of each method, part (c) of Fig. 4 shows the density root-mean-
squared error (RMSE) of each method with respect to (39) for varying ∆t and only until
t = 2.35 s, when the density exceeds the critical density K; see Fig. 4a. It becomes apparent
that both methods converge to the right solution as ∆t → 0, but the accuracy of the proposed
method outperforms the existing method by a factor of two for all values of ∆t.

Fig. 4d shows the optimal candidate that minimizes f (y) at each time step of the numerical
method, which is an element of the set Y, for the ERP rule, and of {xU , x0, xD} for the CT
rule. It can be seen that both methods coincide except for the time step where the density
approaches the critical density, in which case the proposed method ﬁnds the more accurate
optimal candidate y∗
1.

4.2. Variational networks

Daganzo (2005b) introduced time-space networks to solve the traﬃc problem without inﬂows
in variational form using shortest paths. Notice that this is an application of Bellman’s dynamic
programming principle. Each link i in these “variational networks” is deﬁned by its: (i) slope
vi: wave speed, (ii) cost ci: maximum number of vehicles that can pass, (iii) time length τi,
and (iv) distance length δi = τivi; see inset in Fig. 5.

Since the fundamental diagram is assumed triangular and the freeway homogeneous, there
are only three wave speeds to be considered, u, −w and 0, and the corresponding passing rates
are given by

 L(vi) = 


wκ,
Q,
0,

vi = −w
vi = 0
vi = u

(40a)
(40b)
(40c)

Let Ji be the contribution of the J-integral in the cost of each link i. It corresponds to the
(negative of) integral of φ(t, x) over the shaded region in Fig. 5, Si, and can be approximated
by:

Ji = −τiXj∈Si

δjaj,

(41a)

where aj is the inﬂow associated with link j and j ∈ Si means all links that “touch” area Si.
Finally, the cost to be used in each link becomes:

ci =  L(vi)τi + Ji.

(42)

The advantage of this method is that it is free of numerical errors (when inﬂows are ex-
ogenous) but it may be cumbersome to implement unless θ is an integer.
In that case, as
illustrated in Fig. 5 for θ = 2, the location of nodes align on a grid pattern. This allows
deﬁning a conventional grid with cell size ∆t, ∆x where inﬂows may be assumed constant. The
other disadvantage is that merge models are typically expressed in terms of ﬂows or densities
rather than N values, and therefore an additional computational layer has to be added.

5. Other coordinates

As pointed out in Laval and Leclercq (2013) there are two additional coordinate systems
that provide alternative solution methods of the traﬃc ﬂow problems without inﬂows. In space-
Lagrangian coordinates the quantity of interest is X(t, n), the position of vehicle n at time t; in
time-Lagrangian coordinates one is interested in T (n, x), the time vehicle n crosses location x.
These representations correspond to the same surface in the three-dimensional space of vehi-
cle number, time and distance, but expressed with respect to a diﬀerent coordinate system. We
brieﬂy analyze these two alternatives when considering Eulerian source terms and conclude that
even if a HJ equation is still valid in both cases, one cannot expect to get a VT representation
formula even when inﬂows φ(t, x) are exogenous.

11

5.1. Space-Lagrangian coordinates: X-models

Let s(t, n) be the spacing of vehicle n at time t. To derive the X-model we multiply the N-
model (3a) by s to get sNt − sH(k) = sΦ(t, x). Noting that s = −Xn and sNt = −XnNt = Xt,
this can be rewritten as:

Xt − V (−Xn) = −XnΦ(t, X),

(43)

where V (s) = sH(1/s) is this spacing-speed fundamental diagram. We conclude that (43) is still
a HJ PDE but does not admit a VT solution due to the term involving X. The corresponding
conservation law can be obtained by taking the partial derivative with respect to n of (43):

st + V (s)n = −φ(t, X)s2 − Φ(t, X)sn,

(44)

Notice that van Wageningen-Kessels et al. (2013) identiﬁed (44) but without the term Φ(t, X)sn
using a diﬀerent approach, and used it to formulate a numerical solution method in the case of
discrete inﬂows.

5.2. Time-Lagrangian coordinates: T-models

Let r = Tx and h = 1/q be the pace and the headway of vehicle n at location x, and let
F (r) be the fundamental diagram in this case, i.e. h = F (r). Here, the T-model is simply
F (r) = 1/q, where q is given by q = Nt − Φ(t, x), per (5). Noting that Nt = 1/Tn this can be
rewritten as:

Tn −

F (Tx)

1 + Φ(T, x)F (Tx)

= 0,

(45)

which, again, is still a HJ PDE but does not admit a VT solution due to the term involving
T . The corresponding conservation law can be obtained by taking the partial derivative with
respect to x of (45):

rn −

F (r)x + F (r)2φ(T, x)
(1 + Φ(T, x)F (r))2 = 0.

(46)

To summarize, it becomes apparent that in Lagrangian and vehicle number-space coordi-
nates the solution to our problem does not accept VT solutions and therefore becomes more
diﬃcult to solve.

6. Discussion

We have shown in this paper that VT solutions to the traﬃc ﬂow problem exist only in
Eulerian coordinates when inﬂows are exogenous.
In all other cases the Hamiltonian is a
non-local function of the independent variable, and the corresponding variational may not be
possible to formulate. Even in the simplest endogenous linear case (7) the reader can appreciate
the mathematical diﬃculties: using Φ = Φ(s, N(s, ξ(s))) in (8a)-(11) turns the problem implicit
in N, and therefore it is no longer a VT problem.

Improved numerical solution methods for the endogenous case were derived by taking ad-
vantage of this insight. In other ﬁelds, it appears that solving the extended Riemann problems
explicitly considering the inﬂows has not been possible, and the only alternative has been to use
high-resolution Riemann solvers (Schroll and Winther, 1996; LeVeque, 1998). We have shown

12

that this is not the case in traﬃc ﬂow, and that the ERP method presented here is indeed more
accurate.

A streamlined version of the ERP method could be envisioned that drastically improves
computation times with minimal impact in the quality of the solution. To see this, recall that
Fig. 4d showed that the candidate y∗
1 was optimal only during the time step where the density
approaches the critical density. Based on the discussion following eqn. (40) it is reasonable to
conjecture that candidates y∗
6 in (32) would be optimal only when a transition takes
place. Therefore, the streamlined method would consider only the reduced set Y = {xU , x0, xD}
in (32), which would induce an error only in the time step where the transition occurs. This
error can be made arbitrarily small by decreasing ∆t. Notice that this does not mean that the
continuum solution (32) can be streamlined in this way; this is only possible in discrete time
where N-values are updated at each time step.

The implications of our ﬁndings in the context of MFD analytical approximation methods
considering turns as a continuum inﬂow are not encouraging. This is because inﬂows in this
case would have to be endogenous for the method to be meaningful, and in such case we have
seen that there is no VT solution. This implies that the method of cuts–the only method used
so far to provide analytical MFD approximations–is no longer applicable. At the same time,
however, a stochastic extension of the method of cuts proved successful in approximating a
real-life MFD (Laval and Castrillon, 2015). This would indicate that, at least in the context of
the MFD, VT solutions still provide good approximations. Research in this topic is ongoing.
