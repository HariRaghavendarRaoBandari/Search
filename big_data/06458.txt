Abstract

The great majority of algorithms employed in the study of lattice ﬁeld theory are
based on Monte Carlo’s importance sampling method, i.e. on probability interpre-
tation of the Boltzmann weight. Unfortunately in many theories of interest one
cannot associated a real and positive weight to every conﬁguration, that is because
their action is explicitly complex or because the weight is multiplied by some non
positive term. In this cases one says that the theory on the lattice is aﬀected by the
sign problem. An outstanding example of sign problem preventing a quantum ﬁeld
theory to be studied, is QCD at ﬁnite chemical potential.

Whenever the sign problem is present, standard Monte Carlo methods are prob-
lematic to apply and, in general, new approaches are needed to explore the phase
diagram of the complex theory. Here we will review three of the main candidate
methods to deal with the sign problem, namely complex Langevin dynamics, Lef-
schetz thimbles and density of states method.

We will ﬁrst study complex Langevin dynamics, combined with the gauge cooling
method, on the one-dimensional Polyakov line model, and then we will apply it to
pure gauge Yang-Mills theory with a topological θ term. It follows a comparison
between complex Langevin dynamics and the Lefschetz thimbles method on three
toy models, which are the quartic model, the U(1) one-link model with a µ dependent
determinant, and the SU(2) non abelian one-link model with complex β parameter.
Lastly, we introduce the density of state method, based on the LLR algorithm,
and we will employ it in the study of the relativistic Bose gas at ﬁnite chemical
potential.

Introduction

Figure 1: Qualitative representation of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase
diagram.

Starting from the 1980s, lattice ﬁeld theory has been developed and it has been
proven to be a formidable tool to study quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT). In general,
whenever a theory manifests a non-perturbative behaviour at some energy scale,
analytic quantitative solutions are very hard or impossible to obtain.

Discretization on the lattice is a well-established non-perturbative approach for
Euclidian time gauge theories [1, 2, 3, 4]. In particular, much progress has been
made in the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), i.e. the theory of quarks
and gluons, which describes a big part of the high energy physics as we know it.
The success of lattice ﬁeld theory is due to the fact that it can be mapped into a

Statistical Mechanics ensemble and, therefore, all the techniques developed for the
latter are available. The most acknowledged class of methods, successfully employed
to study a vast number of models, is based on Monte Carlo’s importance sampling.
This is a probabilistic way of exploring the space of conﬁgurations of a system, based
on the action S of each conﬁguration. More speciﬁcally, the Boltzmann weight e−S of
a conﬁguration is interpreted as the unrenormalized probability of the conﬁguration
itself and, therefore, it will contribute with this weight to the partition function. In
this way one is able to build a ﬁnite representative sample of the full conﬁguration
space, and use it to compute average values of observables.

Unfortunately this way of proceeding is not applicable any more whenever the
exponential of the action of the system cannot be interpreted as a probabilistic
weight, that is when it is not real and positive. This phenomenon is commonly
referred to as sign problem.

In this case, a way around is to employ methods that, even though they are still
based on Monte Carlo, allow to extrapolate some information even when the action
is complex. Some of these are :

• re-weighting [5], where the complex part eiφ of the weight is incorporated in
the observable, while the expectation value is computed only using the real
part |ρ| of the weight e−S = |ρ| eiφ, namely the phase quenched theory

hOi = hOeiφipq
heiφipq

(1)

• Taylor expansion in the parameters that trigger the sign problem, so that the
quantities one has to compute appear as coeﬃcients, in a theory without sign
problem.

• Analytic continuation from a part of the phase diagram where the action is real,
typically where the parameters that trigger the sign problem are imaginary
[6, 7, 8, 9].

• Strong coupling expansion, in which one exploits the fact that the truncated
series of character expansion of the functional integral is a spin-like system
with a much milder sign problem than the original one [10, 11, 12, 13].

• Mean ﬁeld theory [14, 15, 16]

However, those methods are typically restricted to some areas of the theory
where the parameters that trigger the sign problem are not too large. There are other
approaches which aim to solve the sign problem all together. They are mostly of
recent development so they sometimes lack the control which Monte Carlo methods
achieved over many years. Some of those approaches are :

• complex Langevin dynamics : a stochastic quantization of the ﬁelds is adopted.
The degrees of freedom are complexiﬁed and a real probability distribution for
the observable is generated in the complex space (solution of the Fokker-Planck
equation) [17, 18, 19].

• Lefschetz thimble : new manifolds, equivalent to the original domain of inte-
gration, are found in the complexiﬁed space, along which the imaginary part of
the action is constant and, therefore, the integral is (mostly) real [20, 21, 22].

• Density of states : the density of states of a system is computed and the original
path integral is reduced to a one-dimensional oscillating integral [23, 24, 25].

• Canonical approach : the canonical partition function at ﬁxed number of par-
ticles (or in general conserved charge) is computed, and it is connected with
the general partition function via the fugacity expansion [26, 27, 28].

• Reformulation of the theory in term of dual variables : in some theories it is
possible an exact map into another theory with other variables where the sign
problem is milder or absent[29, 30].

In this thesis we will discuss in detail some of the last group, mainly focusing

on complex Langevin dynamics.

There are many theories aﬀected by the sign problem, not only in quantum ﬁeld
theory but also in real time quantum mechanics and condensed matter. One of the
most important and challenging is QCD at ﬁnite density [31, 32]. Here, in Euclidian
time, the sign problem is generated by the fermionic determinant

Z =Z [DU]e−SY M det M(µ),

(2)

where the links U represent the gluonic degrees of freedom on the lattice, and
det M(µ) is the result of the Grassman integral over the fermionic part det M(µ) =

R dψdψ exp(cid:2)ψ( /D + m + γ0µ)ψ(cid:3). It can be shown that

[det M(µ)]∗ = det M(−µ∗),

(3)

which allows it to be real only if µ is zero or completely imaginary. At ﬁnite µ,
then, the weight is complex and the sign problem arises together with cancellations
in (2). Those are responsible, for example, for an interesting phenomenon called
Silver Blaze, for which, at T = 0, all the thermodynamic observables have to be
independent from the chemical potential, up to the nucleon mass, even though the
determinant explicitly depends on µ.
In particular, the critical baryon chemical
potential is the nucleon mass minus the nuclear binding energy. The qualitative
explanation for this behaviour is that, before the critical chemical potential, there
is not enough energy in the system to create a nucleon at T = 0, at T 6= 0, the
nucleon has still a chance to be created but it will be suppressed by a Boltzmann
factor ∼ exp(−(mN − µB)/T ), where mN is the nucleon mass and µB is the critical

baryon chemical potential. This behaviour is totally spoiled [33] if the oscillations
are neglected by taking the phase quenched theory, i.e. substituting det M(µ) with
its absolute value | det M(µ)| in the partition function.
In practise, the QCD phase diagram in Fig.1 can only be explored, with standard
Monte Carlo methods, close to the y axis, i.e. where the ratio (µ/T ) is small. In
that region, one can still extrapolate information by Taylor expansion in (µ/T ),
reweighting methods or by analytic continuation from imaginary µ where the theory
is real [7, 34].

Recently some progress has been made in exploring the QCD phase diagram,

deep into the oscillating region, thanks to complex Langevin dynamics [35, 36].

One of the other major open problem in quantum chromodynamics is the strong
CP problem. The theory allows the pure gauge action to have an extra gluonic term

makes ﬁne tuning problems arise. Some axion models for a dynamical solution to this
problem have been proposed [37, 38, 39], but still a non-perturbative investigation of
the theory at ﬁnite θ is required. Unfortunately, the topological θ-term is imaginary,
that makes the action (4) complex. Again, the sign problem prevents standard
Monte Carlo methods to explore the whole θ − T plane.
Results have been achieved by analytic continuation from imaginary θ [40, 41,
42], and recently the problem at real θ has been studied with complex Langevin
dynamics [43, 44].

Many other systems aﬀected by the sign problem have been studied, we will see
some of those in the following, and some successfully solved. The main challenge,
however, remains to solve the QCD related sign problem.

This thesis is divided in ﬁve chapters, and all the results shown come from my

work in ﬁrst person.

The ﬁrst chapter reviews the discretization of a ﬁeld theory on the lattice. In
the second, we introduce the stochastic quantization and analyse the requirements
for good control of complex Langevin dynamics. We also discuss the gauge cooling
method and show results of convergence in some models.

The third chapter is about the θ-term. The ﬁrst half, is a review of the instan-
tons’ theory and of the discretization of topology on the lattice. In the second part,
we discuss the application of complex Langevin dynamics to this theory and show

some results. I would like to thank D´enes Sexty for providing the base code which
I developed to get the results shown in this chapter, and also Ben J¨ager and Felipe
Attanasio for their help and discussions along the development of the same code.

In the fourth chapter, we introduce the Lefschetz thimbles method and compare

it with complex Langevin dynamics in the study of some toy models.

The ﬁfth, and last, chapter is about the density of states method. We introduce
the method and discuss its application to the relativistic Bose gas at ﬁnite density.

Quantum ﬁeld theory on the
lattice

Making predictions for a non trivial Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is never an
easy task. Furthermore, if it allows non perturbative interaction between the ﬁelds,
analytical methods are usually not readily available. The most acknowledged way to
overcome these problems is, up until now, to adopt a non-perturbative regularization
of the theory on a discrete lattice of points in Euclidian space-time. Proposed by
Wilson in 1974 [46], lattice QFT has become the most reliable tool for strongly
interacting systems.
In this chapter we’ll brieﬂy review the main concepts behind it.

1.1 Path Integral approach to quantum theory

The path integral approach to QFT, introduced by Feynman in 1948 [45], is one of
the most powerful tools when it comes to non-classical calculations. It is essential not
only in order to perform most of the perturbative calculations but also to study non
perturbative physics. Thanks to this formulation, in fact, a mapping of a regularized
QFT into a statistical mechanic system has been made possible. More precisely, the
quantum degrees of freedom on a discretized space-time can be identiﬁed as the ones
in the canonical ensemble at temperature T and the system is statistically allowed
to visit every conﬁguration.

We will now recall the basic ideas behind the path integral and its connection
with statistical mechanics when Euclidian time is introduced. Let us consider a non
relativistic quantum system ((0 + 1) QFT) described by a Hamiltonian H(p, x). The
matrix element relative to the evolution from the point xa(ta) to xb(tb) is given by

Txa,xb = hxa|e−i H

 (tb−ta)|xbi ;

13

(1.1)

14

one can now insert somewhere in between ta and tb the operator identity I =

R dxc |xc(tc)ihxc(tc)| that leaves, of course, unchanged the probability of transition

from |xai to |xbi

dxc hxa|e−i H

 (tc−ta)|xcihxc|e−i H

 (tb−tc)|xbi .

(1.2)

Txa,xb =Zxc

One can think of repeating this process an inﬁnite number of times by inserting the
identity operator I at every time between ta and tb, integrating over all the possible
values of the ﬁeld x(t) at that time t. Furthermore, if the Hamiltonian is quadratic
in the momenta H = 1
2p2 + V (x), it is possible to carry out the Gaussian integral
over the momenta p and express the eq.(1.1) in the path integral form form :

where L is the Lagrangian of the system

L( ˙x, x) =

˙x2 + V (x) .

(1.4)

Physically, this procedure has the meaning of interpreting the probability of tran-
sition of a system from a state to another as the sum over all possible intermediate
paths weighted with the oscillating phase given by their action along each one of
these paths . As a result, one is not surprised to see the biggest contribution coming
from the paths with stationary phase, called semi-classical approximation, which,
for values of the parameters of the theory comparable with the ones in our everyday
life, will be reduced into the well known classical equation of motion.

Let us go back now to the analogy with statistical mechanics. If we consider a
canonical system described by a Hamiltonian H and in thermal equilibrium with a
heat bath at temperature T , we can write the partition function of the system as

Z(β) = Tr(e−βH) = Xn

hn|e−βH|ni = Xn

e−βEn ,

(1.5)

where β = 1/kBT and |ni are the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with eigenvalues
the values of the energy En . Moreover, since the trace of an operator does not
depend on the basis on which it is computed, one can rewrite the trace in (1.5)
choosing as the base the position |xi

Z(β) = Tr(e−βH) =Z ∞

−∞

dx hx|e−βH|xi

(1.6)

where the similarity with (1.3) is now fairly evident . The last step we have to do
in order to achieve the exact analogy of the two expressions is to rotate the eq.(1.3)
into Euclidian time (Wick rotation)

to identify the inverse of the temperature β with tb−ta
to periodic paths x(ta) = x(tb) = x. With these devices the eq.(1.3) becomes

and to restrict ourselves only

The integral over the time of the euclidian lagrangian LE is referred to as the
euclidian action of the theory

SE( ˙x, x) =Z β

dτ LE( ˙x, x) ,

(1.9)

so that the most common way to express the partition function of a quantum me-
chanical system in euclidian time is

Z = NZ Dx(τ ) e−SE .

(1.10)

Thanks to this formulation, it is now possible to assign to every quantum trajectory
x(τ ) a probability based on the action of the system along that path

P (x(τ )) =

e−SE (x(τ ))

Z

.

(1.11)

When dealing with number of dimensions higher that 0, the above formulation of a
QFT is often still aﬀected by ultraviolet divergences and, therefore, it needs some
regularization before physically relevant quantities can be computed. One possible
regulator, largely used for non perturbative calculations, is the lattice discretization
of the space time. This particular regularization has the property of mapping a
d spatial and 1 time dimension quantum ﬁeld theory in an equilibrium (d + 1)
dimensions statistical mechanics model. Therefore, using the equivalent of (1.11),
it is possible to evaluate the probability the system is likely to be in a certain
conﬁguration given the euclidian action of the conﬁguration itself. More generally
this map allows us to use all the well developed tools of statistical mechanics to
study the QFT .

1.2 Monte Carlo simulations

Most of the physical relevant problems in Quantum Field theory are such that the
ﬁelds in the theory are coupled to each other in a non trivial and non-perturbative

16

In a more formal way this is equivalent to saying that it is impossible to

compute the path integral

Z =Z Dφi O(φi) e−S(gi;∂φj,φk)

(1.12)

exactly or perturbatively because of the interactions in the action S(gi; ∂φj, φk);
here we called the ﬁelds φi, their derivatives ∂φj, and the couplings of the theory gi;
also from now on we will always work in Euclidean space so we will omit the label
E at the bottom of the operators, in this case for example S = SE.

The only way to compute (1.12) is then the numerical approach. There is more
than one class of numerical methods that are, in principle, able to compute the
correct estimation of (1.12) but, if we assume for now that S is real, the most
popular and well developed are for sure the Monte Carlo methods. To be precise,
what a Monte Carlo algorithm is able to compute is not exactly (1.12) but actually
the average value of the observable O

.

(1.13)

hOi = R Dφi O(φi) e−S(gi;∂φj,φk)
R Dφi e−S(gi;∂φj,φk)

The idea at the base of Monte Carlo methods is to sample the conﬁguration’s space
of the ﬁelds φi guided by the probability e−S(φi), in such a way that the conﬁgurations
with smaller action are visited more often and vice versa. This procedure assigns a
weight to the conﬁgurations, based on the frequency f{φi} they have been visited,
and allows one to build a good sample of the conﬁguration space that can be used
to compute any observable

hOi ∼ X{φi}

f{φi}O({φi}) .

(1.14)

Of course the bigger the number of conﬁgurations sampled, the more accurate is
the estimation of hOi; more precisely, the error scales like the inverse of the square
root of the number N of measurements (as long as these are independent from each
other)

δhOi ∼

1
√N

.

(1.15)

It is crucial to observe how important is the hypothesis that the action S(gi; ∂φj, φk)
is real, because if this is no longer true one cannot interpret e−S as a weight to sam-
ple the conﬁguration space and the very premises of the Monte Carlo methods fail.

Lastly, we observe that in general the ﬁelds of a theory live in a space-time
continuum that, in practice, is impossible to be represented compatibly with the
application of any numerical methods. The solution to this problem is to adopt a

1.2 Monte Carlo simulations

discretized space-time commonly called Lattice, where each continuous direction is
replaced with a discrete multiple of a unit of length a called lattice spacing

x = nx ax,
y = ny ay,

nx = 0, 1, .., Nx
ny = 0, 1, .., Ny

.
.

(1.16)

and the boundary of this lattice are periodic in each direction (periodic boundary
conditions) so that

φ(ni = Ni) = φ(ni = 0) .

(1.17)

The original volume is now replaced by a lattice of points evenly spaced in each
direction but, of course, to recover the real value of hOi one has to correctly estimate
the continuum limit which we’re going to discuss later.
Discretization of the space-time has an important impact on the momentum
space, in fact if the shortest wavelength can’t be less then the lattice spacing xmin =
a, it means the large momenta can’t be bigger than pmax = π/a. It follows that the
lattice introduces a cut-oﬀ in the momentum space

(1.18)

restricting all the integrals on the momenta to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone [−π/a, π/a].
Hence, all the loop integrals are ﬁnite and the functional integrals are high dimen-
sional standard integrals. Eventually the cut-oﬀ has to be removed while approach-
ing the continuum limit and this process determines the renormalization group ﬂow
of the theory of the observables. From the point of view of the statistical mechanics,
the lattice structure does not play a crucial role if all the physical length scales are
much larger than the the lattice spacing, which means

ξ ≫ a

(1.19)

where ξ is the correlation length of the system. In this regime the physical quan-
tities are not sensitive to changes in lattice spacing and therefore one can safely
claim the lattice system to be in the continuum limit. Such a regime is reached in
correspondence of a second order phase transition of the theory.

Quantum ﬁeld theory on the lattice

1.3 An example: the Scalar Field

In this section we’re going to brieﬂy review the case of the scalar ﬁeld both because
it is a quite popular and instructive example of discretization of a ﬁeld theory on
the Lattice and because we’ll come across it again describing the density of state
method. Also from now on we will work in the Planck units

 = kB = c = 1 ,

(1.20)

which are the natural units of measurement to use in quantum ﬁeld theory.
A possible scalar ﬁeld theory, expressed in the new units of measurement, could be
represented by the action

S = Z β

0

dτZV

d3x (cid:20)1

2(cid:0)∂µϕ∂µϕ + m2ϕ2(cid:1) + g3ϕ3 + λϕ4 + ...(cid:21) ,

where ϕ is the scalar ﬁeld and g3, λ,etc are the couplings. In general the action can
be quite complicated, including the coupling with non perturbative global charges,
however the purpose of this section is just to illustrate the process of discretization
of a ﬁeld theory; therefore we will limit ourself to the case of the free theory

(1.21)

(1.22)

S = Z β

dτZV

d3x

2(cid:0)∂µϕ∂µϕ + m2ϕ2(cid:1) .

As we mentioned in the last section the analogy with statistical mechanics requires
the adoption of periodic boundary condition in the time direction; as long as bosonic
degrees of freedom are involved, that is formally equivalent to imposing

ϕ(−→x , τ ) = ϕ(−→x , τ + β)

on our scalar ﬁeld .
The next step is to discretise the space-time volume

xµ → anµ ,

(1.23)

(1.24)

where a has the dimensions of a length or, alternatively, of the inverse of an energy
and nµ is the integer that indicates the distance, in multiples of a, in the µ direction.
Since our volume has to be ﬁnite, for practical reasons, there is going to be an Nµ
such that

aNµ = Lµ ,

(1.25)

where Lµ is the edge of our volume in the µ direction, so that we have the condition

0 < nµ ≤ Nµ .

(1.26)

The most common way (but not the only one) to cope with the ﬁnite volume is to
impose periodic boundary conditions also in the space directions, so that

ϕ(nk + Nk) = ϕ(nk) ,

k = 1, 2, 3...,space directions

(1.27)

1.3 An example: the Scalar Field

and to take in account the ﬁnite size eﬀects by studying the scaling of the observables
for increasing lattice sizes, a process known as thermodynamic limit.

It is good practice, then, to rescale every quantity in units of a so that everything
on the lattice is adimensional except the lattice spacing. The mass m has, of course,
the dimensions of an energy, while for the ﬁelds it usually depends on the space-
time dimensions the theory is deﬁned on; in our case, like most of the times, we’re
working with the 4 dimensions so ϕ has the dimensions of an energy. The lattice
variable will then be deﬁned as

m → bm

recalling the original value in the limit a → 0; the notation ϕ(n + −→µ ) means one is
considering the nearest neighbour of ϕ(n) in the −→µ direction . It is easy to see that
the way we choose to discretize the derivative is not unique and there are at least 3
equivalent ways of deﬁning a ﬁrst order discretization of the derivative

• forward derivative

∂µφ(x) →

φ(n + −→µ ) − φ(n)

• backward derivative

∂µφ(x) →

Let us note that, out of the three, only the last one maintains, on the lattice, the anti-
Hermiticity proper of its continuous version; the other two transform one into the
other under the Hermitain conjugate operation. For the scalar ﬁeld this is however

20

not a problem since the square of the derivative in the action makes everything
Hermitian again anyway.

The last thing to be mentioned is that also the integral measure will, of course,
be aﬀected by the discretization of space-time. The integral over all possible paths
will be replaced by the product of the diﬀerential of the ﬁelds on each point of the

In general, the mass m could

its renormalization. For our free theory, however, that is not the case and one can

1.4 Gauge Theories on the Lattice

In this section we are going to brieﬂy review the regularization on the lattice of a
widely studied category of physical theories, namely the Gauge Theories.

Let’s consider a N dimensional matter ﬁeld φ deﬁned on the sites of our lattice,
for example a set of N equivalent scalar ﬁelds of the section before, that transforms
under local unitary group G ∈ SU(N) as

φ(x) → φ′(x) = G(x)φ(x) ;

we now require its action

SL =

1

2 Xn (cid:2)(φ(n + µ) − φ(n))(φ(n + µ) − φ(n))† + m2φφ†)(cid:3)

to be left invariant by such transformation. We clearly see that the part

Sderiv =

4Xµ=−4

φ†(n)φ(n + −→µ ) ,

(1.43)

(1.44)

(1.45)

coming from the derivative, cannot be invariant under the action of G at least in a
trivial way. The way to make up for it, in analogy with the continuum case, is to
introduce a ﬁeld Uµ(x), namely the gauge ﬁeld. Its function is to parallel transport

22

Quantum ﬁeld theory on the lattice

the action of G from φ(n +−→µ ) to φ(n) , along the geodesic connecting the two ﬁelds.
The latter, on the lattice, is the straight line connecting the site n with the one
n + −→µ . The gauge ﬁeld transforms

Uµ(x) → U′µ(x) = G(x)Uµ(x)G−1(x + µ) ,

so that the gauged part of action

Sg
deriv =

4Xµ=−4

φ†(n)Uµ(x)φ(n + −→µ ) ,

(1.46)

(1.47)

has now been made invariant under the action of G. It is clear from the (1.46) that
U(x) is itself an element of SU(N) and can therefore be written in the form

Uµ(n) = eigaAµ(n)

(1.48)

where g is the coupling constant of the gauge ﬁeld, a is the lattice spacing and
Aµ = Aa
µλa is an element of the Lie algebra of SU(N). The generators of the algebra
λa obey the commutation relations

Tr(λaλb) =

N 2−1Xc=1

{λa, λb} =

N

δab +

2

N 2−1Xc=1

dabcλc ,

where fabc are completely antisymmetric tensors, called the structure constants of
the group, while dabc are completely symmetric tensors.
The way we introduced the SU(N) gauge ﬁelds follows what has been originally
the idea from Yang and Mills, i.e. they started from a fermionic matter ﬁeld to
point out that the gauge ﬁeld has to be provided with a dynamics and, therefore a
lagrangian of its own. That means the gauge ﬁeld has the right be considered by
itself regardless of the interaction with any other ﬁeld. Whether or not we consider
the continuum theory or its discretizion on the lattice, the new gauge action has,
of course, to satisfy our initial requirement of being gauge invariant . The simplest
gauge invariant object that can be constructed on the lattice with just gauge ﬁelds
is the plaquette

Πµν = Uµ(n)Uν(n + −→µ )U†µ(n + −→ν )U†ν (n) ,

(1.50)

which, because of (1.46), corresponds to the smallest possible closed loop.
It is
indeed the plaquette that is the basic element of the Wilson formulation of the
lattice pure gauge action

SW = βGXn Xµν (cid:18)1 −

2N (cid:2)Tr(Πµν) + Tr(Πµν)†(cid:3)(cid:19) ,

(1.51)

1.5 The continuum limit

where

βG =

g2 .

23

(1.52)

Using the Baker-Hausdorﬀ lemma and expanding the ﬁelds at the ﬁrst order in a
around the point n

Aµ(n + ν) = Aµ(n) + a∂νAµ(n) + O(a2) ,

(1.53)

it can be shown that the plaquette depends on the strength tensor Fµν at the ﬁrst
order in a

Πµν = eia2gFµν +O(a4) ,

(1.54)

that correctly allows the Wilson action (1.51) to reduce to the well-known pure
gauge action in the limit a → 0

(1.55)

SW →

1

4Z d4x Tr(FµνF µν) + O(a2).

The Wilson action (1.51) is just one of the available choices and any lattice action
based on closed loops that succeeds in recovering the correct naive continuum limit
(1.55) can, in principle, be used. Pure gauge actions based on more complicated
closed loops are often used to achieve a weaker dependence on the lattice spacing,
in order to obtain a better scaling of the observables in the continuum limit.

1.5 The continuum limit

Performing the continuum limit of a theory is a more subtle process than just con-
sider small lattice spacings. As we mentioned before there is a very large number
of lattice actions that correspond to the same continuum formulation for a = 0,
however that is not suﬃcient to claim that the regularized theory processes the
correct continuum limit. In particular, all the dimensional quantities which will be
proportional to a non-zero power of a will go to zero or inﬁnity.

As we mentioned in section 1.2, the essential requirement for the continuum limit

to exist is that every correlation length bξ, deﬁned in lattice units, has to diverge

compared to the lattice spacing. Hence, the continuum ﬁeld theory can only be
realized at a critical point {g∗i } in the parameter space of the discrete theory

bξ(gi) −−−−−−−−−−−→

{gi}→{g∗

i } ∞ .

(1.56)

24

Quantum ﬁeld theory on the lattice

For the Wilson regularization (1.51) of an SU(N) pure gauge theory, the only pa-
rameter is the bare coupling g so that, in this case, the renormalization group is
determined by just one equation. One can ﬁnd it by requiring that any physical
quantity O(a, g) should not depend on the regulator of the lattice spacing

(1.57)

(cid:20)a

∂
∂a − β(g)

∂

∂g(cid:21) O(a, g) = 0 ,

where

β(g) = −a

∂g
∂a
is called β−function.
If one was able to know β(g) then it would be possible to
integrate (1.58) to obtain g(a) and basically know the renormalization group of the
theory for every value of a. Of course β(g) cannot be known exactly, but it can still
be calculated in perturbation theory around the critical point

(1.58)

β(g∗) = 0 .

(1.59)
In the proximity of the ﬁxed point we can expand the β−function in powers of
(g − g∗)
∂g
a
∂a

= β1(g − g∗)3 + β2(g − g∗)5 + ... .

(1.60)

For SU(N), the ﬁrst non zero term that can be compute in perturbation theory is
β1 = 11N
48π . Furthermore, we know from asymptotic freedom that g∗ = 0. We are
now able to predict, at least at the ﬁrst order, the dependence of the lattice spacing
from the coupling

1

2β0g2

,

a =

−
e

1
ΛL

(1.61)

where ΛL in an integration constant with the dimensions of a mass and, in general,
depends on the renormalization scheme that has been adopted.
The standard way to approach the continuum limit is to consider the ratio of di-
mensionful quantities of the theory. Let us suppose we know a particular mass m0
from the experiments

m0 =

1

a(g)ξ(g)

,

(1.62)

where ξphy = a(g)ξ(g) is the physical correlation length corresponding to the inverse
of the mass m0; we can use this information to set the scale of the theory on the
lattice so that every other mass mi can be computed in relation to it

mi
m0

= lim
g→g∗

ξ0(g)
ξi(g)

.

(1.63)

In practice one can consider to have reached the continuum limit when the above
ratio (1.63) holds constant within the statistical error of the measurement.

Chapter 2

Complex Langevin dynamics

In this chapter we are going to review the main concepts behind complex Langevin
dynamics along with its recent developments and successes. The main advantage of
this method, compared to standard Monte Carlo ones, is that it does not rely on
the action to assign a weight to the ﬁeld conﬁgurations. This approach, as we shall
see, is therefore not aﬀected by the sign problem at all when it comes to numerical
simulations.

2.1 Stochastic dynamics

The path integral approach described in the previous chapter, however successful, is
just one way to quantize a QFT. In general, other choices are possible and, following
Damgaard and Huﬀel [17], we are going to review one of the most robust alternatives,
namely stochastic quantization. The idea was ﬁrst introduced by Parisi and Wu [47]
in 1980 and consists of considering the Euclidian QFT as an equilibrium limit of a
system governed by a stochastic process. The system evolves in an additional time
tL under the eﬀect of some drift force, determined by the system, together with
random noise. When the equilibrium is reached, for tL → ∞, stochastic averages
become identical to ordinary Euclidean vacuum expectation values.
The oldest and best known stochastic equation, and the one we are interested

in, is the Langevin equation [48]

m

v(t) = −αv(t) + η(t) ,

(2.1)

introduced in 1908 to describe the Brownian motion of a particle of mass m in a
ﬂuid with viscosity α that randomly collides with other particles of the ﬂuid with
intensity and direction η. The latter is represented by a gaussian distributed random

hηi(t)i = 0 ,
hηi(t)ηj(t′)i = 2λδijδ(t − t′) ,

(2.2)

with mean 0 and variance 2λ . This old model, however simple and classical, is
worth brief analysis to gain some insight into the Langevin stochastic process. The
Langevin equation (2.1) is a non-homogeneous ﬁrst order linear dﬀerential equation
and therefore can be analytically solved as the Green’s function

(2.3)

We notice that the dependence on the initial conditions v(0) is lost exponentially
fast with time so that we might as well assume that v(0) = 0 without losing any
generality. Having an equation for v(t) we want to calculate some physical quantity
from it, for example the average kinetic energy of our Brownian particle

We note that by taking λ = kT α the correct value for the average kinetic energy
E = 3
Since eventually we are going to be interested in numerical simulations, it is essential
for us to know the behaviour of the probability distribution governing the Langevin
stochastic process. Let us set λ = 1, in this case, the observables will be functions
of the velocity v(t)

hO(v(t))iη ≡ Z Dη exp(cid:18)−

m = α = 1), one gets

∂v(cid:18)v +

∂

∂v(cid:19)(cid:21) P (v, t) = Z dv O(v)

(2.10)

This gives an equation for the evolution of the probability distribution P (v, t) that
goes under the name of Fokker-Planck equation

∂P (v, t)

∂t

=

∂

∂v(cid:18)v +

∂

∂v(cid:19) P (v, t) .

(2.11)

We notice that the stationary solution ∂
∂tP = 0 of eq.(2.11), after requiring the
condition P (v) = P (−v), leads to the Boltzmann distribution for the Brownian
particle in equilibrium with the system

P eq ∼ exp(cid:18)−

v2

2(cid:19) .

(2.12)

The Fokker-Planck equation, as we shall see, will play a crucial role in the
numerical application of the Langevin dynamics in the case of a complex ﬁeld theory.

2.2 Stochastic quantization of a ﬁeld theory

The idea behind stochastic quantization is to formulate the equivalent of the Langevin
equation (2.1) for a ﬁeld theory in such a way that the associated Fokker-Planck dis-
tribution may have the Euclidian Boltzmann distribution exp(−SE) as the unique
stationary solution.
The ﬁrst step is the introduction of an additional ﬁctitious time tL in which the

stochastic systems evolves

φ(x0, .., xn) → φ(x0, .., xn, tL) .

(2.13)

From now on we are going to call the Langevin time tL just t, having in mind it is
diﬀerent from the Euclidian time x0 .

28

Complex Langevin dynamics

The second requirement is that the evolution of ﬁelds be described by the Langevin
stochastic equation

∂
∂t

φ(x, t) = −

δS

δφ(x, t)

+ η(x, t) ,

(2.14)

where S is the Euclidian action of the ﬁeld theory, which also depends on the
Langevin time ,

S = Z dtdnx L(cid:18)φ(x, t),

∂
∂t

φ(x, t)(cid:19) ,

and η(x, t) is again Gaussian white noise

hη(x, t)i = 0 ,
hη(x, t)η(x′, t′)i = 2 δn(x − x′)δ(t − t′) .

(2.15)

(2.16)

In the same way as in the classical case, equation (2.14) is associated with a proba-
bility distribution function P (φ, t) for the ﬁelds at the Langevin time t

hφ(x1, t)...φ(xn, t)iη = Z Dφ P (φ, t) φ(x1)...φ(xn) ,

(2.17)

which satisﬁes the Fokker-Planck equation, corresponding to (2.11), generalized for
the ﬁeld theory

= Z dnx

δ

δφ(x, t)(cid:18) δS

δφ(x, t)

+

δ

δφ(x, t)(cid:19) P (φ, t) .

(2.18)

As a ﬁnal remark we would like to show that the former equation (2.18) leads
P (φ, t) to converge to the Euclidian Boltzmann weight of the standard path integral
quantization exponentially fast with Langevin time. Let us consider, for simplicity,
one degree of freedom x. The partition function of this system reads

Z = Z dx e−S(x)

and the corresponding Langevin equation is

dx
dt

= −∂xS(x) + η .

The time evolution of the associated probability distribution function P (x)

hO(x)i = Z dx O(x)P (x, t)

is determined by the Fokker-Planck equation

∂tP (x, t) = ∂x [∂x + ∂xS(x)] P (x, t) ,

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

2.3 Complex Langevin dynamics

29

whose stationary point is easily found to be P (x) ∼ e−S(x). Moreover, we can rewrite
eq.(2.22) upon the transformation

P (x, t) = ψ(x, t) e− 1

2 S(x) ,

into the Schr¨odinger-like equation

where

˙ψ(x, t) = − HF P ψ(x, t)
HF P = (cid:18)−∂x +

S′(x)(cid:19)(cid:18)∂x +

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

2

S′(x)(cid:19) .

The operator (2.25) is self-adjoint and, if | limx→∞ S′(x) → ∞|, the spectrum of its
eigenvalues is non negative and discrete

HΨn = EnΨn ,

(2.26)

2 S(x) annihilating eq. (2.25). Therefore we can rewrite

with the ground state Ψ0 ∼ e− 1
ψ(x, t) on the base of the eigenvectors of HF P
2 S(x) + Xn

ψ(x, t) = c0 e− 1

cnΨn(x) e−Ent → c0 e− 1

2 S(x)

(2.27)

and the correct distribution P (x) ∼ e−S(x) is reached exponentially fast.

2.3 Complex Langevin dynamics

We already discussed how a complex weight prevents the application of standard
Monte Carlo methods. On the other hand, stochastic processes do not rely on
importance sampling, which makes them good candidates to deal with the sign
problem. In this section we shall see how Langevin dynamics can be generalized to
the case of complex actions S(x), examining in detail the careful steps that make
this method successful.
A straightforward adaptation of (2.20) for a complex action is still possible and
would lead to the Langevin equation

˙x = −∂xS(x) + η

and, consequently, to the FP equation

∂tρ(x, t) = LT

0 ρ(x, t) ,

(2.28)

(2.29)

30

Complex Langevin dynamics

where LT
complex. Eq.(2.29) is expected to have the desired complex weight

0 is the usual Fokker-Planck operator LT

0 = ∂x (∂x + ∂xSc(x)) that now is

ρ(x) ∼ e−S(x)

(2.30)

as a stationary solution. However, being complex-valued, ρ(x) is not suitable to be
regarded as a probability distribution function (PDF) as in (2.21). Furthermore, the
associated FP Hamiltonian HF P (z), the complex equivalent of (2.25), is not self-
adjoint any more, so that a proof of exponentially fast convergence to the unique
solution cannot be provided. The way to proceed then [18, 49], is to consider the real
and imaginary parts of the complexiﬁed variables z → x+iy as new and independent
degrees of freedom

˙x = Kx +pNR ηR
˙y = Ky +pNI ηI ,

with the two drifts

Kx = −ℜe ∂zS(z),

Kx = −ℑm ∂zS(z) .

(2.31)

(2.32)

The correlators between the noises ηR and ηI derive from the original prescription
(2.2) on the complex noise η = ηR + iηI and read

hηR(t)ηR(t′)i = 2NRδ(t − t′)
hηI(t)ηI(t′)i = 2NIδ(t − t′)
hηR(t)ηI(t′)i = 0

where NR − NI = 1 and NI ≥ 0.

The complexiﬁcation of the Fokker-Planck equation

˙P (z, t) = ∂z(NR∂z − Kz)P (z, t)

(2.33)

(2.34)

can be written, for holomorphic observables, in terms of the two independent vari-
ables x(t) and y(t) in (2.31)

˙P (x, y, t) = [∂x(NR∂x − Kx) + ∂y(NI∂y − Ky)] P (x, y, t)

(2.35)

and has the form of a continuity equation with the probability density P (x, y; t)
being the charge

˙P (x, y, t) = ∂xJx + ∂yJy ,

and

Jx = (NR∂x − Kx)P ,

Jy = (NI∂y − Ky)P ,

(2.36)

(2.37)

2.3 Complex Langevin dynamics

31

being the currents. Eq.(2.35) generates a real PDF for the holomorphic observables

hOiP (t) = Z dxdy P (x, y, t)O(x + iy) ,

(2.38)

which is, in fact, the main idea of complex Langevin (CL) dynamics, i.e. to refor-
mulate a d−dimensional complex system into a 2d−dimensional real one. One re-
quirement is to consider the holomorphic continuations of the observables hO(x)i →
hO(z)i = hO(x + iy)i. In this sense neither the quantity hO(x)i nor hO(y)i have,
by themselves, any meaning in the complexiﬁed space.

The reason why complex Langevin dynamics was not largely employed immedi-
ately after its introduction in the 80’s is that the equation (2.35), even keeping the
same form of the real case, is much harder to solve or to be proved convergent to
the appropriate stationary distribution ρ(x) ∼ e−S(x) [50, 51, 52]. On top of that,
unstable solutions of (2.32) can be found in the complex plane and that was believed
to inevitably spoil the dynamics when solved numerically. These two problems have
been more recently addressed, allowing CL to become one of the most acknowledged
methods when it comes to system aﬀected by the sign problem.
The issue of instabilities on the lattice was the ﬁrst to be successfully and consis-
tently solved [53]. The discretized CL equations for the ﬁeld φ are

where ǫ is the discrete Langevin time step and x labels the sites of the lattice. When
the system is brought near an unstable trajectory τ (φR, φI), the drifts K R(τ ) and
K I(τ ) can potentially lead the ﬁelds to inﬁnity, in a ﬁnite Langevin time tL = ǫn.
It turns out that careful integration in the form of adaptive stepsize ǫn along those
trajectories is enough to completely remove the problem. The idea is to keep the

chosen optimally depending on the system, in order to greatly reduce the stepsize
ǫn along the unstable trajectories and allow the real component of the random noise
ηR to kick the system away from such trajectories. For this purpose, the imaginary
component of the random noise ηI is, in general, counter-productive so that is usu-
ally preferable to get rid of it. This is in perfect accord with the prescriptions (2.33)
and corresponds to the choice of parameters NI = 0 and NR = 1.

The problem of convergence of CL is much more complicated to address. Although
no deﬁnitive solution has been found yet, fundamental progress has been made to
fully understand this issue.
In particular proofs of convergence have been found
to infer, from the distribution of the observables, whether the CL is expected to
converge to the right result or not [54, 18, 55, 56, 57]. In the following, we are going
to review the main arguments behind these criteria.

32

Complex Langevin dynamics

We can rewrite eq. (2.35) in a more compact way

P (x, y; t) = LT P (x, y; t)

∂
∂t

where

LT = ∂x(NR∂x − Kx) + ∂y(NI∂y − Ky) .

(2.40)

(2.41)

It is easy to see that the adjoint of the operator LT determines the time evolution
of a function f along a solution z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) of the CL equation (2.31). Let
us consider the scalar product :

hP, fi = Z f (x, y)P (x, y) dxdy

(2.42)

where the time evolution operator can be moved from the probability density P (x, y; t)
to the function f in the usual way

hLT P, fi = hP, Lfi ,

so that the time evolution of f is described by

d
dthf (x(t), y(t))i = hL f (x(t), y(t))i ,

(2.43)

(2.44)

where the brackets mean averages over the stochastic noise (2.33) and the Langevin
operator L has the form

L = (NR∂x + Kx)∂x + (NI∂y + Ky)∂y .

(2.45)

Our purpose is to obtain some conditions under which the analytically continued
holomorphic observables O(x + iy), distributed according to the real-valued PDF
(2.35) P (x, y; t), retain the same average values as if deﬁned on the real manifold
O(x), weighted with the complex function ρ(x) in (2.29), i.e.

hOiP (t) = R O(x + iy)P (x, y; t)dxdy
R P (x, y; t)dxdy
hOiρ(t) = R O(x)ρ(x; t)dx
R ρ(x; t)dx

.

In other words, one would like

hOiP (t) = hOiρ(t)

,

(2.46)

(2.47)

provided the two are identical at the start hOiP (0) = hOiρ(0), which is easily assured
if

P (x, y; 0) = ρ(x; 0)δ(y) .

(2.48)

2.3 Complex Langevin dynamics

33

In order to link the two expressions for the average values of O in (2.47), we deﬁne
for 0 ≤ τ ≤ t the function

F (t, τ ) = Z P (x, y; t − τ )O(x + iy; τ )dxdy

which interpolates between the two deﬁnitions

F (t, 0) = hOiP (t),

F (t, t) = hOiρ(t) .

(2.49)

(2.50)

While the ﬁrst equality is straightforward, the second can be seen using the pre-
scription for the initial conditions (2.48) and integrating by part

F (t, t) = Z P (x, y; 0)(cid:0)etLO(cid:1) (x + iy, 0)dxdy

= Z ρ(x; 0)(cid:0)etL0O(cid:1) (x, 0)dx
= Z O(x, 0)(cid:16)etLT
0 ρ(cid:17) (x, 0)dx
= Z O(x, 0)ρ(x; t) = hOiρ(t) .

(2.51)

We only had to assume that no boundary contribution is introduced by the integra-
tion by parts, which is a very standard requirement on ρ(x) without which it cannot
possibly be integrated anyway. One could now obtain the (2.47) on the condition
that the interpolating function F (t, τ ) is independent on τ .

∂
∂τ

F (t, τ ) = −Z (cid:0)LT P (x, y; t − τ )(cid:1) O(x + iy; τ )dxdy
+Z P (x, y; t − τ ) (LO) (x + iy; τ )dxdy

(2.52)

It is evident, after integration by part, that the two pieces of the former equation are
equal and opposite except for a possible boundary contribution coming from inﬁnity
in the complex plane.

The one above is the core argument for the criteria of correctness, that can be

summarized like this :
the formal argument for which complex Langevin is expected to converge to the
right result, might fail when the distribution of the observables

P (x, y; t)O(x + iy)

(2.53)

does not decay fast enough in the complex plane, giving rise to boundary terms. On
the other hand, if the distribution (2.53) is localized enough, one expects CL to
converge to the right result (detailed studies of those conditions can be found here
[57, 56]). In general, more care is needed when the drift ∂zS(z) has poles, since the

34

Complex Langevin dynamics

hypothesis of holomorphicity drops. In those cases one has to study in detail how
the dynamics is inﬂuenced by the poles and whether the results are correct or not
will depend on the speciﬁc case [58, 59] .

Let us conclude by saying that, when the criteria of correctness are satisﬁed,
the stationary Fokker-Plank probability P (x, y) should be positive-deﬁnite, since
it is the distribution built up during the Langevin process. E.g. by binning the
process one sees that in a bin with size dxdy, P (x, y) is either 0 or > 0. This
assumes the relation between the Langevin process (2.31) and the FP distribution
P (x, y) holds, which it should when the stochastic process converges. Whether it
is normalisable, depends on how the distribution goes to zero at large x and y. In
numerical simulations, we always check the behaviour of P (x, y) at large x and y,
since it is also necessary for the criteria of correctness, and it always seems to be
fast enough. However one might still argue that long tails might not be adequately
sampled. In practice, we always ﬁnd that if the complex Langevin converges, the
stationary Fokker-Plank probability is normalisable.

2.4 Gauge Theories and Gauge Cooling

We will now start to describe the application of Langevin dynamics to gauge the-
ories with sign problem. The most recent developments allowed the use of CL to
investigate some of the most challenging and fundamental problems in the physics
of strong interactions, such as ﬁnite density heavy quark QCD [19, 49, 44, 60], full
QCD [61, 62, 63, 64, 35] and QCD in the presence of a topological θ−term related
to the strong CP problem [44, 43]. We will review CL dynamics in the context of
gauge theories, introduce the gauge cooling method and analyze in some detail how
this helps to control the criteria of convergence.
For nonabelian SU(N) gauge theories on the lattice, the Langevin equation for the
link U reads

Uµx(t + ǫ) = Rµx(t)Uµx(t),

Rµx(t) = exp"−iXa

λa(cid:0)ǫDaS[Uµx] + √ǫηaµx(cid:1)# ,

(2.54)

where ǫ is the discrete Langevin time step used during the simulations, λa are the
Gell-Mann matrices (a = 1, ..., N − 1) and Da is the SU(N)Lie derivative

Daf (U) =

∂
∂ω

f(cid:0)eiωλaU(cid:1) |ω=0 .

(2.55)

2.4 Gauge Theories and Gauge Cooling

As usual ηa is real Gaussian noise satisfying the relations

hηaµxi = 0 ,
hηaµx(t) ηbµx(t′)i = 2δ(t − t′)δab .

35

(2.56)

Looking at eq.(2.54), one immediately realizes that for complex actions S[U] the
operator R(t) takes values into the group SL(N, C). Consequently, even if at the
beginning the links U were in SU(N), the whole dynamic will be naturally enlarged
in the bigger SL(N, C) . The element of this group retain the property det U = 1
but lose the unitarity : U−1 6= U†. To preserve analyticity then, every observable
will have to be expressed in terms of U and U−1, rather than U†. For example the
correct analytical continued equivalent of the scalar quantity Tr(UU†), equal to N in
SU(N), would be Tr(UU−1) which, in fact, is still equal to N for every matrix U ∈
SL(N, C). The operator Tr(UU†) itself, however, can now take any real value bigger
than N, as a consequence of the non compactness of SL(N, C). In particular this
can be seen since every element U ∈ SL(N, C) can be written (polar decomposition)
as

U = P V

(2.57)

with V ∈ SU(N) and P = P † a positive deﬁnite matrix with det P = 1. This
property of Tr(UU†) allows us to deﬁne the Unitarity Norm (UN) D, a quantity
that measures how deep in the SL(N, C) manifold is the conﬁguration

D =

1
N

Tr(cid:0)UU† − 1(cid:1) ≥ 0 ,

(2.58)

where evidently D= 0 for SU(N).
It is possible to deﬁne the UN in many other
ways that still allows to quantify the distance to real manifold SU(N), but the one
in eq.(2.58) is the simplest and the one we are going to use in the following.
Gauge invariance is still present in SL(N, C)

Uµ(x) → U′µ(x) = Ω(x)Uµ(x)Ω−1(x + µ),

Ω ∈ SL(N, C) ,

(2.59)

however the gauge transformation Ω(x) does not leave the UN (2.58) invariant, while
its analytical continuation Tr(UU−1) is preserved. Let us note that the parameters
of the gauge group are now twice as many as in the case of SU(N)

Ω = eiωaλa,

ωa ∈ C

(2.60)

and, as we are about to learn, this abundance of gauge freedom is rather harmful for
CL dynamics. It has been observed for many gauge models [65, 19, 49] that the CL
dynamics, if left alone, tend to explore the huge gauge freedom available, bringing
the system deep in the complex manifold. That, as one might expect, eventually
leads to a wide distribution that violates the criteria of correction mentioned in the
previous section.

36

Complex Langevin dynamics

The way to deal with this problem, ﬁrst introduced in [19], takes the name of gauge
cooling (gc.), and consists in gauge transforming all links of a given conﬁguration
up to the point where the UN (2.58) is minimal. One can achieve this by choosing
as a parameter of the gauge transformation the gradient of the UN itself along the
gauge orbit :

Ω(x) = e−ǫαgf faxλa,

fax = 2Tr"λaXµ (cid:16)Ux,µU†x,µ − U†x−ˆµ,µUx−ˆµ,µ(cid:17)# , (2.61)

where ǫ is of the order of magnitude of the stepsize used in the Langevin process and
αgf is a parameter which can still be chosen to optimize the gauge cooling. One can
convince himself that the gauge cooling reduces the UN by looking at the eﬀect an
inﬁnitesimal gauge transformation (2.61) has on (2.58). For convenience we chose
the gauge cooling transformation to be active only on the even sites while being the
1 on the odd ones

Uµ(x) → U′µ(x) = Ω(x)Uµ(x) ,
Uµ(x − µ) → U′µ(x − µ) = Uµ(x − µ)Ω−1(x) .

(2.62)

With this convention the change in UN along the gauge cooling trajectory can be
easily calculated

D′ − D = −

ǫαgf
N

(fax)2 + O((ǫαgf )2) .

(2.63)

Depending only on (fax)2, the right hand side of the equation above is always nega-
tive, up to higher orders in ǫαgf , resulting in a monotonic decrease of the UN itself.
If the original conﬁguration is gauge-equivalent to a SU(N) one, cooling will even-
tually transform the conﬁguration into the unitary one. Once the unitary manifold
is reached, fax vanishes, as evident from (2.61), so that gauge cooling no longer has
any eﬀect. On the other hand, if the starting conﬁguration is not gauge-equivalent
to SU(N), gauge cooling will bring it as close as possible, i.e.
it will minimize D
(Fig.2.1).

Although it is rather diﬃcult to show that the minimum of the unitarity norm
is unique, in practice, we observed many times that if we operate a SL(3, C) random
gauge transformation on a conﬁguration and then we apply gauge cooling, the con-
ﬁguration is always brought back to the same minimum. That is a strong indication
that the minimum is unique. However, even if the minimum wasn’t unique, that
wouldn’t mine the usefulness of gauge cooling, which idea is to keep the dynamic
close to the real manifold.

It is also important to stress that, since the gauge cooling process is separate
from the CL evolution, it is not equivalent to gauge ﬁxing term, i.e. it is not derive
from a gauge ﬁxing of the action, and, consequently, no Fadeev-Popov determinant
is needed.

Let us remark that the complex Langevin dynamics is gauge invariant, in the
sense that having an inﬁnite precision machine the results with or without gauge

cooling would agree. The eﬀect of gauge cooling is to minimizing the rounding errors
by keeping the links as ’small’ as possible with a gauge transformation.

One link model

Let us have a look at the gauge cooling process in a 1-link SL(N, C) model [49],
where analytical insight is possible. Since gauge cooling is completely disconnected
from the CL dynamics itself, the form of the action is irrelevant to the following.
After taking the continuous Langevin time limit (ǫ → 0), the eq.(2.63) becomes, to

where the minimum distance is, as expected, larger than 0. This brief example and
the analytical computations involved support what is shown in the sketch of Fig.2.1.
When it comes to more complicated models, the eﬀect of gauge cooling can only be
computed numerically but the behaviour remains the same.

Adaptive gauge cooling for SU(2) Polyakov chain

Most of the cases of interest are too complicated to be studied analytically so that
numerical computations are required. Here we shall discuss the case of a one-
dimensional chain of Nl SU(2) gauge links (Polyakov chain), with the action

(2.76)

This property is very useful in that it allows us to know the expectation value of the
observable Tr(U) and, at the same time, it does not lessen the interest in the original
Polyakov chain model. In fact, from a numerical point of view, the full model in
(2.72) still has as many degrees of freedom as the number of group parameters times
the number of links, and can be used as a useful toy model to study the eﬀect of
gauge cooling in anticipation of proper four-dimensional gauge theories.
Before studying the actual dynamics of the system, we start by gauge transforming
a SU(2) conﬁguration into SL(2, C) and applying gauge cooling to it until it is back
in the original real manifold. Fig. 2.2 shows, on a logarithmic scale, the eﬀect of
gauge cooling on the distance D (2.58) increasing the number of links in the Polyakov
chain. For Nl = 1 one ﬁnds numerical agreement with our analytical calculation of
the one link model, i.e. the exponential fall oﬀ of the UN to the SU(2) ﬁxed point
D = 0. When Nl > 1 the exponential behaviour is slower and slower until it appears
to become non-exponential for Nl = 100.
In gauge theories the number of degrees of freedom usually grows with the volume,
that is why it would be preferable to ﬁnd an implementation of gauge cooling that
can keep the fall-oﬀ of the UN as fast as possible given the number of degrees of
freedom involved. A possible solution is adaptive gauge cooling [49]. The idea is,
given a transformation Ωgc(x) = e−ǫαgf faxλa, to adapt the strength agf of gauge
cooling depending on the proximity to the stationary point of eq.(2.63).

conﬁguration, we still expect a sub-exponential decay of the kind seen in Fig. 2.2
for Nl = 100. On the other hand, adaptive gauge cooling will be eﬀective at the
beginning of the cooling process when αad is truly adaptive and strongly dependent
on the UN. All these consideration can be veriﬁed looking at Fig. 2.3. Here we can
see that, compared to the ﬁxed gauge cooling the adaptive gauge cooling signiﬁ-
cantly helps the decrease of the UN in the ﬁrst steps, while later on it stabilizes
on an almost identical decay behaviour. This can be better seen looking at Fig.
2.4, where the same data are plotted on a log-log scale and a common asymptotic
powerlike decay of the order t
2 (t being the number of gauge cooling steps) can be
observed. In conclusion, we learned that with an adaptive implementation even just
the ﬁrst few cooling steps are enough to greatly reduce the distance from SU(2). In
the remaining part of the chapter we are going employ this method in the actual
dynamics of the system to help its convergence to the right result.

The complex Langevin dynamics simulations are carried out in such a way that
between two consecutive Langevin update steps, a certain number of gauge cooling
steps is applied to the links. We would like to stress again that, since the action
(2.72) is complex-valued for β ∈ C, CL dynamics is required for the full model even
if the exact results are available thanks to the equivalence with the one-link model.
2(1 + i√3).

We will now present results for a chain with Nl = 30 links at β = 1

First of all, looking at Fig. 2.5, one is completely convinced of the role of gauge
cooling, i.e. keeping the distance (2.58) from the conﬁguration to the SU(2) manifold
as small as possible during the whole CL evolution. Here the black line represents
the UN as a function of langevin time during the CL evolution, without any gauge
cooling being applied. One can then appreciate how the introduction of ﬁxed gauge
cooling (red line) has an important eﬀect in reducing the UN of roughly two orders
of magnitude. Even more, when adaptive gauge cooling is applied, the UN gets
reduced by another order of magnitude. Of course the Polyakov chain, thanks to
the complex action, will evolve in SL(2, C) and will not be gauge equivalent to an
SU(2) conﬁguration, so that one expects the UN to be, in general, diﬀerent than 0.
Although the UN is a strong indication of the compactness of the distribution in the

42

complex SL(2, C) manifold, the exact condition that has to be satisﬁed in order to
satisfy the criteria of correctness, is about the distribution of the observables itself.
Fig. 2.6 shows an histogram of the distribution of the action S = β
Tr (U1U2...UNl)
Nl
in the complex plane (ℜe(S) and ℑm(S)). We can see how the eﬀect of gauge cooling
in keeping the UN as small as possible also directly aﬀects the distribution of S. The
black line (no gauge cooling applied) clearly shows that the distribution of S is quite
widely spread and presents a sub-exponential decay in the complex direction. That
corresponds to violation of the criteria of correctness and, as shown in Fig. 2.7 for
number of gauge cooling steps = 0, to the convergence of CL to the wrong results.
The application of ﬁxed gauge cooling, 10 ﬁxed gauge cooling steps every CL step,
improves considerably the situation and makes the distribution much more localised
although skirts are still present. Finally, with the adaptive choice the distribution
is localised very well and drops quickly to zero outside its main support.

tion of the number of gauge cooling steps applied after every CL step. The black

value after just 4 steps.

In this chapter, we showed how complex Langevin dynamics is a powerful method
to deal with the sign problem. In particular, we discussed the existence of criteria of
correctness, the meeting of which leads to the convergence of CL to the right results.
Then, we introduced the concept of gauge cooling and employed it in the study of
the Polyakov chain model. We explicitly showed how the eﬀect of gauge cooling
results in the satisfaction of the criteria of correctness and, consequently, leads the
CL dynamics to the right results.

In the next chapter we are going to apply those concepts in the study of a more
complicated and physically interesting gauge theory, i.e. Yang-Mills pure gauge with
a CP violating topological θ term.

Topology in QCD started to get attention in the middle of the 70s with the famous
paper by Polyakov al.
[66]. In particular, they discovered classical solutions with
non-trivial topology to the Yang-Mills equation, called the instantons. Those ﬁelds
were found to represent, in Minkowsky space, tunneling events between degenerate
classical vacua of the theory. Because proven to generate conﬁnement in certain 3d
models [67] instantons became immediately a very hot topic of research. However it
was eventually realized that they could not be the cause in 4d Yang-Mills theories.
Nevertheless, they were proven to be responsible for very important phenomena
such as the anomalous breaking of the U(1)A symmetry [68] due to their interaction
with the zero-modes of light quarks (index theorem). For the same reason they were
found to be the cause of the large mass of the η′ meson by the mechanism proposed
by Witten [69] and Veneziano [70]. In the same years, the θ-vacua structure of QCD
was introduced and systematically studied [71, 72, 67]. It was realized that a CP
violating topological θ-term should be included in the QCD lagrangian; however,
a calculation of the neutron magnetic dipole [73] constrains this coupling to being
negligible (θ < 10−10). A deﬁnitive mechanism to explain why the θ-term has to be
so small is still to be discovered and goes under the name of strong CP problem.

One of the most elegant solutions would be the introduction of the QCD axion
particle. This particle would be a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson which arises from
the spontaneous breaking of a hidden chiral symmetry (Peccei-Quinn symmetry) of
the Standard Model [37, 38]. Not only the broken symmetry would automatically
suppress the CP violating part of the action, but the mass of the axion could be a
candidate for the dark matter in the universe.

In this chapter we will review in some detail the instantons’ picture and the structure
of the QCD vacua (see [74, 75] for extensive treatment). Later on, we will discuss
the study of topology on the lattice and present new results using complex Langevin
dynamics.

3.1 Vacua of SU(N) and instantons

To describe the classical vacua of the pure gauge Yang Mills theory one has to ﬁnd
the zero energy ﬁeld conﬁgurations. The gauge SU(N) ﬁelds are deﬁned in the usual
way :

where a = 1...N and λa are the Gell-Mann matrices. The minimum of the action

is given by those ﬁelds that satisfy the condition

Gµν = 0 ,

i.e. the pure gauge ﬁelds of the form

Aµ = iU(x)∂µU†(x) U ∈ SU(N) .

A physical interpretation of their role can be given in the temporal gauge A0 = 0,
in which the ﬁelds of the vacuum have the time independent form

Ai(x) = iU(x)∂iU†(x),

(3.5)

where x indicates only the spatial directions. In this gauge, it is possible to identify
[76] that the gauge transformations that can be connected with the trivial topological
sector, where Ai(x) = 0, are only the ones that respect the condition

U(x) → 1 for |x| → ∞ .

(3.6)

This condition is equivalent, for what concerns U(x), to the compactiﬁcation of R3
in the S3 hyperspherical surface and, therefore, U(x) can be seen as an application
that maps S3 into SU(N).

Those maps can be divided into disjointed homotopy classes and classiﬁed with

an integer winding (or Pontryagin) number nw

which, in terms of the corresponding gauge ﬁelds, is the Chern-Simons number

Let us remark that the winding number nw (or nCS) is not gauge invariant, as
it is deﬁned in the temporal gauge, and in three dimensions, only. However, the
diﬀerence between two winding numbers is gauge invariant because, as we shall see,
it can be related to a gauge invariant quantity, i.e. the topological charge.

The picture is then that Yang-Mills theories have an inﬁnite number of distinct
classical conﬁgurations with zero energy, each one can be related to an integer num-
ber nw. Those vacua, however, are not completely isolated from one another. In
fact, there are ﬁelds conﬁgurations that tunnel between two vacua with a diﬀerent
winding number. Those ﬁelds are classical solutions of the euclidean equations of
motion. In particular, using the identity

4g2Z d4x Ga

µν(cid:17)2(cid:21) , (3.9)
one can rewrite the action as a sum of the topological invariantR d4xGµν ˜Gµν, with

a semi-positive deﬁnite part. The minimum, then, is the (anti)self-dual solution

(3.10)

In Euclidian space, one can prove that the (anti)self-dual solutions automatically
satisfy the Yang-Mills classical equations of motion

DµGµν = 0.

(3.11)

These conﬁgurations are called instantons (anti-instantons) and, to have a ﬁnite
contribution from the action, they need to be pure gauge at inﬁnity

Aµ(x) −−−→x→∞ iU(x)∂µU(x)† .

(3.12)

We notice that this generates again a maps from the three sphere S3 into the gauge
group SU(N), which can labelled by an integer number Q ∈ Z called topological
charge. This can be better understood in the case of SU(2) where the group itself is
homeomorphic to the S3 sphere. In this case eq.(3.12), or better its exponentializa-
tion, is an application that maps S3 into S3 and the corresponding homotopy group
π3(S3) is also isomorphic to the integers Z, from which the winding number that
represents how many times the ﬁrst sphere wraps around the second one. For this
reason two solutions with diﬀerent topological charge Q, cannot be deformed one
into the other with a continuous transformation without violating ﬁniteness of the
action. The same argument can be extended to every gauge group since [77] every
continuous application U : S3 → G, with G Lie group, can be deformed continuously
in an application U : S3 → SU(2)⊂ G.
Diﬀerently from the case of the vacuum ﬁelds (3.5), this time the map arises
naturally, not only in a speciﬁc gauge, which results in the topological charge Q
being a gauge invariant quantity. This can also be seen from its formal deﬁnition

(3.15)

Going back to the temporal gauge, we notice that the only component of K µ that
survives in (3.14) is K 0, which is precisely the winding (or Chern-Simons) number
deﬁned before in (3.8). Then, the integral (3.15)

(3.9), the action of those conﬁgurations is

Sinst =

which generates a probability of tunneling

(3.17)

(3.18)

where the coeﬃcient of proportionality has to be evaluated using perturbation the-
ory.

A classic example of a SU(2) instanton with charge Q = 1 is the BPST (Belavin,

Polyakov, Schwartz & Tyupkin) instanton [66]

µ(x) = 2ηaµν

(x − x0)ν

ν = 4,

(3.20)

For the anti-instanton solution, with topological charge Q = −1, one just needs to
replace ηaµν → ηaµν, which is the same tensor as (3.20) with just opposite signs in
the temporal directions.

Let us brieﬂy recall the properties of the two ﬁelds :

those are the solutions which annihilate the strength tensor

those are semi-classical, (anti)self-dual solutions of the equations of motion
Gµν = ± ˜Gµν. They represent, in Minkowsky space, tunnelling events between
two diﬀerent vacua of QCD and they have a ﬁnite action contribution

Sinst =

8π2|Q|

g2

.

(3.25)

Since the inﬁnite number of degenerate vacua are connected by some tunneling
events, the correct way to express the ground state of the theory, in analogy with
the Bloch’s theorem, is a linear combination of all the separate topological vacua

|θi =

∞XQ=−∞

eiθQ|Qi

(3.26)

where |Qi indicates the vacuum with topological number Q and eiθQ comes from
the periodic structure of the vacua. From (3.26) one understands that, in principle,
there are an inﬁnite number of possible ground states corresponding to all the values
θ ∈ [0, 2π). However, we shall see that any choice of θ isolates a sector of physical
states completely disconnected from the others at diﬀerent values of θ. If we consider
the unitary gauge transformation R that generates a shift of one in the topological
vacuum

R|Qi = |Q + 1i ,

(3.27)

50

Theta term

then we realize, from (3.26), that the ground state |θi is an eigenstate of R

R|θi = e−iθ|θi .

(3.28)

Furthermore, any gauge invariant operator O must commutate with the gauge trans-
formation R, i.e. [O, R] = 0. Hence,

(3.29)

(3.30)

0 = hθ| [O, R]|θ′i =(cid:16)e−iθ′
hθ|O|θ′i = 0 .

that, when θ 6= θ′, implies

− eiθ(cid:17)hθ|O|θ′i ,

That means it is impossible for any physical (gauge invariant) operator to connect
states with diﬀerent θ. Furthermore, since [H, R] = 0 also holds, the ground state
|θi remains unchanged in time. In other words θ is a parameter of super-selection
of the physical theory that, once selected, remains constant with no possibility of
contact with states at diﬀerent θ.

Let us note that the ground state is not CP invariant as the topological vacua

|Qi are not (CP(Q) = −Q). One can explicitly see this from (3.26)

CP|θi =

∞XQ=−∞

e−iθQ|Qi 6= |θi ,

(3.31)

where the strength of CP violation is characterized by the angle θ. However, experi-
mental evidences on the neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM) limit the violation
of CP in our world to a very small value. In particular, this can be translated in a
constraint on the parameter θ [73]

θ < 10−10 .

(3.32)

This unnaturally small value of θ, which is otherwise not restricted by theory, is
known as the strong CP problem. One elegant solution was proposed by Peccei
and Quinn [37], which makes the θ-parameter vanish dynamically. However, the
mechanism also requires the appearance of a Goldstone boson, the axion, which
remains to be discovered.

Axial anomaly and Atiyah-Singer index theorem

For historical reasons, we are now going to brieﬂy mention how the non-trivial
vacuum structure of QCD is essential to explain the UA(1) axial anomaly in the
context of chiral symmetry breaking.

Let us start by deﬁning an anomaly in the context of quantum ﬁeld theory. One
talks about anomaly when a group of transformation G leaves unchanged the action

3.1 Vacua of SU(N) and instantons

51

of the theory G(S) = S, but not the measure of integration G(dµ) = dµ′ of the
generating functional :

Z =Z dµ e−S/ ,

(3.33)

so that, overall, G(Z) = Z′
6= Z. As a consequence, the Noether current, classi-
cally associated to the symmetry of the action in respect of the group G, will not
be conserved any more. When that happens, one says that a classical symmetry is
anomalously broken at the quantum level. We see that in the limit S ≫  (classical
limit) only the saddle point of the action Smin contributes and, therefore, the inte-
gration over the measure in the ﬁeld space does not matter any more. In this limit
the conservation of the Noether current is restored, as it should be.

QCD chiral symmetry is a physical example where an anomalous breaking of
symmetry occurs. Let us recall the Lagrangian of Nf families of massless fermions:

Lmassless =

NfXf =i

f

ψ

(x)i6∂ψf (x) =

NfXf =i

qf
L i6∂ qf

L + qf

R i6∂ qf
R ,

(3.34)

R
qf

where we have explicitly written the left and right components of the spinor ψf =

(cid:18) qf
L (cid:19). The Lagrangian is invariant under chiral rotation, in the Nf fermions

families, of both left and right components independently. The resulting symmetry
is the group of transformations U(Nf )L × U(Nf )R called chiral symmetry.
In QCD all the quarks are massive so, in principle, there is no exact chiral
symmetry. However, the three quarks (u, d, s) have masses much smaller than the
chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking energy scale Λχ ∼ 1GeV. Therefore, they
can be regarded as massless in ﬁrst order approximation, in the sense that the
spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry dominates over the explicit one. At
ﬁrst order in the quark masses, then, the chiral symmetry in QCD is

U(3)L ⊗ U(3)R ,

and can be decomposed into the irreducible representations :

U(3)L ⊗ U(3)R → SU(3)L ⊗ SU(3)R ⊗ U(1)V ⊗ U(1)A .

(3.35)

(3.36)

The U(1)V symmetry corresponds to the baryon number conservation and the U(1)A
is anomalously broken as we shall see in a bit. As anticipated before, however, chiral
symmetry spontaneously breaks at temperatures of the order of 1GeV. In particular
the group

SU(3)L ⊗ SU(3)R ,

is broken down to the vector subgroup

SU(3)V ,

(3.37)

(3.38)

52

Theta term

which results in the classiﬁcation of the hadrons into the SU(3) irreducible repre-
sentations. The remaining 8 broken generators produce as many Goldstone bosons,
namely the octet of pseudo-scalar mesons (π±, π0, K±, K 0, η). Those mesons, de-
spite being Goldstone modes, are massive as a result of the mass of the quarks that
explicitly prevents chiral symmetry to be realized exactly.

The part which, historically, created most of the trouble was the U(1)A symme-

try, i.e. the one associated with the transformation

qL → eiθγ5qL

qR → e−iθγ5qR .

(3.39)

That this symmetry was anomalous was ﬁrst discovered by Adler [78], in the context
of QED, and then extended by Jackiw and Bell for QCD [79]. The realization of
such a symmetry would protect the neutral pion from the decay into two photons
π0 → γγ, when we know that, on the contrary, this amplitude is ﬁnite in QCD

Γ(π0 → γγ) ≈ 8.4 eV.

(3.40)

Furthermore, it is also impossible for it to be realized in the Nambu-Goldstone way
since, in this case, one expects the presence of another light Goldstone boson with a

mass m 6 √3mπ ≈ 230 MeV, which is not observed in nature. The only meson with

the correct quantum numbers is the η′, however its mass is too big mη′ = 958 MeV.
In the late 70’s, Gerard ’t Hooft [68, 80] showed that the axial current of singlet

j5
µ(x) =

NfXi=1

ψi(x)γµγ5ψi(x)

(3.41)

was not conserved at the quantum level due to the presence of ﬁeld conﬁgurations
with non trivial topology.
In particular, the anomaly explicitly depends on the
topological charge

∂µj5

µ(x) =

Nf
16π2 Ga

µν

˜Ga

µν = 2Nf Q(x) ,

(3.42)

and cannot, therefore, be set to zero, resulting in the non conservation of the axial
current.

The η′ mass was also explained through the anomaly in connection with topol-
ogy. More precisely the famous Witten-Veneziano formula relates it directly with
the topological susceptibility in Yang-Mills theory

χ(Y M ) =

f 2
π
2Nf

(m2

(3.43)

We shall brieﬂy show how exactly the instantons are related to the divergence
of the axial current. Let us consider the case of massless quarks in which the chiral
unbroken symmetry is exact. In this case, the fermion propagator is the inverse of
the Dirac operator S(x, y) = hx|(i6D)−1|yi. The Dirac operator can be expressed

3.1 Vacua of SU(N) and instantons

in term of its eigenfunctions i6Dψλ(y) =Xλ

reads :

53

λψλ(y), so that the fermion propagator

S(x, y) = Xλ

ψλ(x)ψ†λ(y)

λ

.

(3.44)

One can then express the variation of the axial charge Q5 = R in terms of the

fermion propagator (3.44)

∆Q5 = Q5(t = +∞) − Q5(t = −∞) = Z d4x ∂µj5

= NfZ d4x Tr Xλ

ψλ(x)ψ†λ(x)

λ

µ(x)

(3.45)

(3.46)

(3.49)

Now we note that γ5ψλ is also eigenfunction of the Dirac operator :

6D(γ5ψλ) = −γ56Dψλ = −λ γ5ψλ ,

with eigenvalue −λ. That means ψλ and γ5ψλ are orthogonal, which makes the
integral (3.45) vanish for every λ 6= 0. On the other hand, the zero modes ψ0 give a
ﬁnite contribution. Furthermore, one can choose the base in which chirality is well
deﬁned, i.e. γ5ψ0 = ±ψ0 for right/left handed zero modes. In this way the integral
(3.45) reduces to

∆Q5 = 2Nf (nL − nR) ,

(3.47)

where nL and nR are the number of positive and negative chirality zero modes of
the Dirac operator. The connection with topology arose when ’t Hooft realized that
the Dirac operator i(∂µ + Aµ)γµ has a zero mode solution when the ﬁeld Aµ is the
instanton (3.19). This solution is

ψ0(x) =

ρ

((x − x0)2 + ρ2)3/2 φ ,

(3.48)

where x0 and ρ are, respectively, center and size of the instanton, and φ is a space-

independent spinor. However, since 6Dψ0 = 0, it is clear that det(cid:0)[6D(AI

along the instanton solution AI

µ. That means the functional integral of the vacuum

µ)](cid:1) = 0

Z =Z DAµ det (6D[Aµ]) eS(Aµ) ,

will vanish exactly for such conﬁgurations. Another way to say it is that tunnelling
between vacua of the theory is suppressed in the presence of massless fermions. In

54

Theta term

the chiral limit (mf erm = 0), in fact, we know that the topological susceptibility
has to vanish χchiral
top = 0. However, the tunnelling amplitude is non-zero in the
presence of external quark sources, because zero modes in the denominator of the
quark propagator may cancel against zero modes in the determinant.

Although the theory in the continuum is quite developed, exact calculations
of many quantities (such as η′ mass, tunnelling amplitudes, etc...) require a non-
perturbative approach. In particular, the study of the theory dependence from the
θ-term is very challenging on the lattice since it is aﬀected by the sign problem.
Already the pure gauge theory SU(3) + θ-term cannot be simulated with standard
Monte Carlo methods for real θ. Our goal, in this chapter, is to study pure gauge
theory at real θ.

3.2 Topology on the Lattice

The nature of topological phenomena is highly non-perturbative. Some quantities
could still be computed using approximated models like the diluted instanton gas
approximation or in the large N limit. For a completely non-perturbative study,
however, the use of lattice ﬁeld theory is required. Historically, the ﬁrst main reason
that brought interest in the study of topology on the lattice was the non-perturbative
determination of the topological susceptibility for the Witten-Veneziano formula
(3.43).

At ﬁrst, one might think that the lattice should not be able to retain the topo-
logical content of the conﬁgurations. In fact, lattice regularization requires the space
to be discrete where every link can be continuously deformed into the trivial one
Uµ(x) = 1. Therefore, the conﬁguration space is simply connected; that means ho-
motopy classes do not exist on the lattice and topology is, strictly speaking, always
trivial. However, one must not forget that any operator deﬁned on the lattice has a
physical meaning only in view of its continuum limit. The topological quantities are
no exception and so one just has to deﬁne a regularization of those operators such
that they represent the proper physical quantities in the continuum limit, where the
standard non-trivial topology is recovered. In particular, it can be shown [81, 82]
that for small values of the local action density

4Xν>µ(cid:18)1

6

Re Tr [1 − Πµν(p)](cid:19) < ǫ ,

(ǫ ≈ 0.07) ,

(3.50)

sp =

3Xµ=1

where Πµν is the 1 × 1 plaquette, the lattice ﬁeld conﬁgurations fall again into well
deﬁned topological sectors. This regime is reached naturally when approaching the

3.2 Topology on the Lattice

55

continuum limit where the value of the bare coupling becomes small (g → 0) and
(3.51)

g2 + O(g4) .

hspi =

3
8

However, it is not necessary to perform the continuum limit to meet the requirement
(3.50). There are, in fact, various methods which main idea consists of smoothing
the ﬁeld conﬁgurations towards the local minimum of the Wilson action. This
procedures ”cool” down the conﬁgurations to values of S < ǫ, getting rid of the
short range ﬂuctuations letting the long range topological modes emerge. We are
going to discuss one of these methods in more detail later in this chapter.

We will start by introducing the local operator representing the density of topo-
logical charge on the lattice. As usual, more than one operator can be built that
recover the correct naive continuum limit

qL(x) → a4q(x) + O(a6) ,

(3.52)

and they diﬀer for orders O(a6). One of the simpler and more common choice is the
twisted double plaquette operator

qL(x) = −

1

24 × 32π2

±4Xµνρσ=±1

ǫµνρσTr[Πµν(x)Πρσ(x)] ,

(3.53)

where, again, Πµν is the 1 × 1 plaquette and ǫµνρσ is the completely anti-symmetric
Levi-Civita tensor extended to the negative directions with the prescription ǫµνρσ =
−ǫ(−µ)νρσ. The presence of ǫµνρσ requires the plaquettes Πµν and Πρσ to lie on two
completely orthogonal hyperplanes. To get the bare, i.e. unrenormalised, topological
charge on the lattice one has, then, simply to sum over all the lattice sites

QL = Xx

qL(x) .

(3.54)

Taking the naive limit a → 0, one can show (3.53) to classically recover the correct
form of the continuum
g2

qL(x) −−→a→0

a4

32π2 TrhGa

µν

˜Gaµνi + O(a6) .

(3.55)

However, as anticipated before, the operator (3.53) needs to be correctly regulated
on the lattice before it can represent the topological charge of the lattice ﬁelds. In
particular a multiplicative renormalization is required

qL(x) → a4Z(g2)q(x) + O(a6) ,

(3.56)
where Z(g2) is a ﬁnite function of the bare coupling g2, obeying Z(g2) → 1 in the
limit g → 0. The value of Z(g2) can be computed in perturbation theory near the
continuum ﬁxed point and, for SU(3), it is [83, 84]

Z(g2) = 1 − 0.908g2 + O(g4) .

(3.57)

56

Theta term

The presence of the additional renormalization (3.57) is the reason why computing
the bare topological charge (3.54) will not result only in integer numbers, but any real
value. The value of Z(g2) cannot be computed using perturbation theory far away
from the continuum limit. In this case one has to employ some techniques that can
extrapolate the topological content from a conﬁguration in a non perturbative way.
Apart from using the fermionic deﬁnition of topology, via the index theorem, there
are a number of techniques (cooling, smearing, gradient ﬂow), that successfully deal
with the gluonic operator (3.53). Despite the diﬀerences between those methods,
they all involve smoothing of the ﬁeld in order to eliminate the short range quantum
ﬂuctuations and enhance the classical long range modes. In fact, they all result in
the recovery of an almost integer value for the topological charge (3.54).

Problems with lattice renormalization of topological observables ﬁrst arose when
trying to compute the topological susceptibility on the lattice as a way to validate
the Witten-Veneziano formula for the η′ mass. The expression for the topological
susceptibility on the lattice is the topological charge two point function

χL = Xx

hqL(x)qL(0)i = hQ2
Li
V

.

(3.58)

This quantity will be aﬀected, other than from the multiplicative renormalization,
also from an additive one due to the contact terms arising when x = 0 :

χL = Z 2(g2) a4χ + M(g2) .

(3.59)

The additive renormalization M(g2) contains the mixing terms of χL with all the
other operators with the same quantum numbers and dimension dimO ≤ dimχL = 4,
i.e. the trace of the energy tensor and the identity

M(g2) ∼ A(g)hGa

µνGa

µνi + B(g) .

(3.60)

In general, those renormalizations completely dominate the value of QL and χL even
in the scaling region of the continuum limit (80%-90% of the real value). That is
why particular care has to be put in eliminating those factors.

From now on we are going to use the following notation for the topological charge

on the lattice

Q is the renormalized topological charge ,
QL is the bare one ,

where two deﬁnitions are related via (3.56)

QL = Z(g2) Q .

(3.61)

(3.62)

The renormalization factor Z(g2) can be non-perturbatively estimated using
one of the smoothing methods that allows to sample the the correct value of the
topological charge

Z(g2) = hQQLiθ=0
hQ2iθ=0

where the expectation value of Q2 has to be chosen because hQiθ=0 = 0.

3.2.1 Gradient Flow for SU(3)

We shall now brieﬂy describe the gradient ﬂow method in relation to topology [85, 86]
. It has been shown in [87], for SU(3) gauge theory, that the smoothing process
obtained with gradient ﬂow is equivalent to the one obtained with standard cooling.
However, the ﬁrst one seems to be more suitable to be extended to the SL(3, C)
group in order to be employed together with complex Langevin dynamics. This
is because most of the other methods (like stout smearing, action cooling) require
the re-projection of some quantities onto the original unitary manifold, which is
not easily extendible in the case where the original manifold is SL(3, C). On the
contrary, the gradient ﬂow does not present this inconvenience as it does not involve
any projection and, therefore, can be extended more naturally to the complexiﬁed
manifold. The gradient ﬂow equation, in the continuum, is

˙Vµ(x, τ ) = −g2 [∂x,µS(V (τ ))] Vµ(x, τ )
Vµ(x, 0) = Uµ(x) ,

(3.64)

where with ˙Vµ(x, τ ) we indicate the diﬀerentiation of the link Vµ(x, τ ) with respect
to the ﬂow time τ , S(V (τ )) is the Wilson action at the time τ and ∂x,µ is the Lie
derivative with respect of the link Vµ(x, τ ). We should note that (3.64) is very
similar to the inﬁnitesimal classical, i.e without statistical noise, Langevin equation.
They diﬀer, though, because the coupling g cancels from the equation (3.64) in such
a way that the evolution in gradient ﬂow time is independent from the coupling.
Since the variation of the ﬁeld ˙Vµ(x, τ ) is proportional to minus the gradient of the
action, it is clear that along the gradient ﬂow, the action decreases monotonically,
˙S ≤ 0, smoothing the gauge ﬁeld in accord with (3.50).

The discretized version of (3.64) is :

Vµ(x, τ + ǫ) − Vµ(x, τ )

ǫ

= − Xa

T r(cid:2)λa (Γµ(x) − Γ−1

Γµ(x) =

4X|ν|6=µ,ν=−4

Πµν(x)

(3.66)

is the sum of all the plaquettes containing the link Uµ. There are several ways to
numerically integrate the equation (3.65); more reﬁned algorithms will have better
convergence in ǫ but will be computationally slower. We choose, for simplicity, to

As one can see, after some thermalization time, the value of the topological
charge stabilizes on an (almost) integer plateau. Eventually it will fall down onto
an other (almost) integer plateau and so on until the conﬁguration reaches the
real classical minimum of the Lattice Wilson action, the trivial one with all links
Uµ(x) = 1 and Q = 0.
In this speciﬁc example we can see how the topological
content of the conﬁguration consists in 2 anti-instantons, one with Q = −1 and the
other with Q = −2. Let us point out that the fact that the plateaus are not exactly
integers is just a ﬁnite size eﬀect. As soon as the the instanton’s size becomes much
smaller than the physical volume considered, the values of the plateaus reproduce
the correct integers. We can also look at what happens to the action during the
gradient ﬂow time. In Fig. 3.2 we can see how the plateaux of the action represents
the metastable minima of the Wilson action. As soon as an instanton is destroyed
the system tunnels back to the minimum closer to the absolute minimum of the
Wilson action with Q = 0.

3.3 Complex Langevin dynamics for SU(3) gauge

theory with a θ-term

We shall introduce now the theory we want to study. In the introduction to this
chapter, we mentioned why the strong CP problem is still a hot topic to be studied
and how the introduction of an axion ﬁeld might be an elegant solution for it. The
Peccei-Quinn argument, however, requires the θ parameter to be a dynamical vari-
able of the theory and, because of that, one needs to be able to perform simulations
at ﬁnite θ.

Other than that, the dependence of QCD on θ is of theoretical and phenomeno-
logical interest by itself. In fact, derivatives of the vacuum free energy F (θ) in respect
to θ, computed at θ = 0, enter various aspects of hadron phenomenology. For ex-
ample, we saw that the topological susceptibility χtop enters the Witten-Veneziano
equation for the η′ mass. The susceptibility χtop can be seen both as the second mo-
ment of the topological charge distribution and as the linear response of the hQtopi
to the parameter θ.
In the continuum, the Lagrangian of pure gauge theory with the θ-term reads

Lθ =

where in the second part we recognise the topological charge density introduced in
(3.13). Noticing that ǫµνρσGa
ρσ(x), it is easy to see
that the Wick rotation has no eﬀect on the topological charge. This fact is quite
relevant since it results in the θ-term being imaginary also in Euclidian space

Z(θ) = Z [DA] e−SY M e−iθQtop = exp[−V f (θ)] ,

(3.69)

where f (θ) = F (θ)
is the free energy density. From the large-N limit, it has been
V
conjectured [88, 89] that the free energy F(θ) is a multibranched function of the type

N (cid:19) .
F(θ) = N 2 mink H(cid:18)θ + 2kπ

(3.70)

This function is periodic in θ, but (if H is not constant) it cannot be smooth and,
at some value of θ, there has to be a jump between two diﬀerent branches.
In
particular only the three points θ = 0 and θ ± π leave (3.70) invariant under a CP
transformation (θ → −θ) . Furthermore, the absolute minimum of the free energy
must be at θ = 0 where the integrand of the Euclidean space path integral is real
and positive (Zmax = e−V fmin).

It would be very interesting to verify this conjecture directly. However, this is
not possible because the complex integration measure (3.69) prevents, in general, the
theory to be studied on the lattice using standard Monte Carlo methods. However,

3.3 Complex Langevin dynamics for SU(3) gauge theory with a θ-term

61

some information on the free energy has been extrapolated, around F (0), using
imaginary θ [40, 41, 42]

θR ≡ −iθI ,

(3.71)

and then analytically continue the results at real θR. One might expand the free
energy density around the minimum at θ = 0

F (θ) = f (θ) − f (0) =

2

χθ2s(θ) ,

(3.72)

where χ is the topological susceptibility and s(θ) is a dimensionless function of θ,
which can be expanded as

s(θ) = 1 + b2θ2 + b4θ4 + ... .

(3.73)

As said before, the coeﬃcients χ, b2, b4,etc. are of great phenomenological interest
and they are related, through derivatives of the free energy, to the connected mo-
menta of the topological charge distribution. From (3.69), in fact, one ﬁnds :

dk

dθk f (θ) = −(−i)khQkiθ

,

(3.74)

and, in particular, this equation can be used to relate the topological charge expec-
tation value to the coeﬃcients :

hQiθ = i V

d
dθ

f (θ) = i V χθ(1 + 2b2θ2 + 3b4 θ4 + ...) .

(3.75)

It is clear, then, that the topological charge distribution is a very interesting observ-
able to be studied at ﬁnite θ.

As we mentioned before, the deﬁnition of the topological charge on the lattice is
aﬀected by the renormalization factor Z(β) (3.63). When simulating at ﬁnite θ, this
will not only aﬀect the measurements of topological observables, a problem solvable
using cooling techniques, but also the evolution of the system itself. Since the action
depends on the bare topological charge Sθ = iθQL, it is necessarily aﬀected by its
renormalization. The common strategy, in the case of ﬁnite θ, is to calculate Z(β)
at θ = 0 and then carry out the simulation at ﬁnite θ absorbing the renormalization
into the parameter

Sθ = iθLQL = iθLZ(β)Q = iθQ .

(3.76)

Here Q is the proper integer topological charge and we called θL the bare parameter
assigned in the simulation. Eq (3.76) tells us that the actual value of the coupling
with the topological charge is the renormalized

θ = Z(β)θL.

(3.77)

One needs, then, to rescale one’s results in order to be dependent on the correct
renormalized parameter θ.

In the following we are going to introduce the complex Langevin dynamics for
pure gauge in the presence of a ﬁnite θ-term, and we are going to show our results.

3.3.1

complex Langevin dynamics

Let us discuss the set up and recall the CL equation for gauge theories

Uµx(t + ǫ) = Rµx(t)Uµx(t) ,

Rµx(t) = exp"−iXa

λa(cid:0)ǫDaS[Uµx] + √ǫηaµx(cid:1)# ,

(3.78)

where both Uµx and Rµx belong to SL(3, C), as it is evident from (3.78) when the
action S[U] is complex. Again, ηa is real Gaussian noise satisfying the relations

hηaµxi = 0 ,
hηaµx(t) ηbµx(t′)i = 2δ(t − t′)δab .

(3.79)

The lattice action is the discretized version of (3.68), i.e. Wilson action plus the
topological charge coupled with the parameter θ

(3.80)

where with Πµν we indicate the plaquette. It is useful, at this point, to ﬁx some
notation, with which we are going to indicate the following :

θ = renormalized θ, equivalent to the one in the continuum ,
θL = bare (unrenormalized) θ on the lattice ,
θI = imaginary bare θ ,
θR = real bare θ .

(3.81)

We shall now brieﬂy discuss our strategy. The results shown in this section are
mainly presented in the papers [44, 43]. Before starting to simulate the complex
action at real θR, a lot of care has to be put in the preparatory tests. As dis-
cussed in the last chapter 2, in order to control the exploration of the complexiﬁed
conﬁguration space of complex Langevin dynamics, gauge cooling is needed.

• Particularly important is the behaviour of CL at imaginary θI where the ac-
tion, starting from a SU(3) conﬁguration, should remain real during all the
evolution. As it is well known, also in the case of Monte Carlo methods, ma-
chine rounding errors tend to kick the dynamics oﬀ the SU(3) manifold. The
standard procedure that prevent this to happen is called reunitarization and
consists in projecting back, every now and then, each link into the original
SU(3). Reunitarization can be applied also to Langevin dynamics, as long as
the action is real, granting its convergence (as seen in Cap.2 for convergence of

3.3 Complex Langevin dynamics for SU(3) gauge theory with a θ-term

63

real Langevin dynamics). However that would not give us any information on
the stability of CL in the case when the action is complex and reunitarization
is not applicable. What we do, instead, is to let free CL to explore the complex
space, even at θI, and just use gauge cooling (see Cap.2) to control it. In this
way we can study the stability of CL in reproducing the correct distribution.
Furthermore, it can be observed (and it has been shown [19]) that the main
concern for the correct convergence of CL, comes from the β dependence of the
Wilson action rather than from the parameters that trigger the sign problem
(θ in this case). Making sure CL converges correctly with the real action is,
then, a strong hint for its convergence even with complex action, at least in a
similar range of parameters.

• The second point we want to make sure of is for the observables to behave
smoothly in the transition from θI (real action, θ2< 0) to θR (complex action
θ2> 0). After we ascertained CL can be controlled with gauge cooling at θI, a
smooth (without jumps) behaviour around θ2 = 0 indicates convergence also
in the complex manifold, at least for small θR.

• Third and most important argument is the satisfaction of the criteria of cor-
rectness discussed in Cap.2. The compactness of the observables in the com-
plex directions is always the most important property to be veriﬁed in order
to ensure convergence of CL .

We shall proceed with the ﬁrst point. As a proof of good convergence of CL
at θL we choose to reproduce the topological charge distribution and confront it
with the one obtained via the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method. In Fig.(3.3) we
show the result of such a test, at bare θL= ±20i and β = 6 on a 124 lattice. Here
conﬁgurations are generated using complex Langevin dynamics, including gauge
cooling, to control the process. We subsequently use gradient ﬂow to smooth them
and recover their topological content. We observe the expected response as the sign
of θL is ﬂipped, i.e. hQiθ is compatible with −hQi−θ as predicted by (3.75). Also we
checked the average value of the topological charge and we found agreement with
the one computed with the HMC algorithm
hQiCL = −5.38(±0.06),
hQiCL = 5.46(±0.06),

hQiHM C = −5.42(±0.09) ,
hQiHM C = 5.48(±0.09) .

θI = 20 :
θI = −20 :

(3.82)

That is enough to make us conﬁdent CL converges to the right results at θI , at least
for values of β not much smaller than 6 .

To proceed with our testing plan, we compute the plaquette at 3 values of β,
for the bare parameter going from imaginary θ2
L > 0. In Fig.3.4, we
can see the smooth transition of the plaquette from imaginary θ to real ones. Good
agreement with Monte Carlo results is also shown at imaginary θL. As expected,
the plaquette does not depend much on θ, so that it keeps staying on the same value
also at θ2
L > 0. Nevertheless, this is a very useful result because it shows the good
behaviour of CL when the action is complex.

dynamics with gauge cooling and subsequently applying gradient ﬂow to recover the
discrete values of the charges. The spacing between the peaks is a bit smaller than
one as a ﬁnite volume eﬀect, and this is responsable for the peaks being shifted in
respect to the integers.

As mention before, the key point to trust the simulation at θR is the distri-
bution of the observables in the complex plane. In Fig.3.5 we show the normalized
histograms of the values of the real and imaginary part of the action (ReS and ImS).

tally for clarity.

plane (often referred to as ’skirt’ of the observable). The more tight the skirts are,
the better CL criteria of correctness are satisﬁed. We can see that at larger β, gauge
cooling is very eﬀective in controlling the skirts of the distribution while it becomes
more and more problematic at smaller β. Eventually the skirt will become too wide
to be controlled and CL will have problems of convergence. Nevertheless in the cases
presented, even for β = 5.9, CL reproduces the correct values for the action, as the
results at small θR lie on the analytical continuation of the ones at θI (Fig.3.4).

Let us stress further that, at this stage, we are not yet interested in measuring
physical quantities. In this sense, even if some observable is likely to be aﬀected by
ﬁnite-size eﬀects in a 64 volume at β = 6.1, we are only interested in comparing CL
and Monte Carlo at the same volume and β and get the same results.

3.3.2 Topological charge distribution

Having completed the preliminary tests, we shall now go back to our goal to study
the topological charge dependence on θ. The behaviour we would like to reproduce
is the one shown in equation (3.75). Unfortunately to do so we run into the problem
of renormalizations of θ. We mentioned before, (3.77), that it would be enough just
to rescale θ in the action with the renormalization factor Z(β) computed at θ = 0
(since it only depends on β). However, this procedure is not correct when both the
action and the observable measured are aﬀected by the same renormalization. In
particular, if the observable is QL itself, this can be seen from the partition function

hQLi =

1

Z(θL)Z [DU] QL e−SW e−iθLQL ,

(3.83)

where the noise of QL measured autocorrelates with the one of QL in the action. In
this case, one ﬁrst has to measure the correct renormalized topological charge Q and,
only after, he is allowed to rescale θL to get the correct result. However, computing
the renormalized topological charge at real θ would require the implementation of
some smoothing technique in SL(3, C) which is a hard task and is still a work in
progress (we will show some results in the last section). Instead, what we are going
to present here is a study of the bare lattice theory.

In the bare theory, the bare topological charge is still expected to follow the

behaviour of (3.75), but with diﬀerent values of the coeﬃcients χ, b2, b4, .. :

hQLiθI = − V
hQLiθR = i V

Here we explicitly wrote down the dependence of QL on imaginary and real θL

In Fig.3.6 we show the behaviour of the bare topological charge in the transition
from θI to θR , for small values of the bare parameters θL. The shaky lines are the
running averages of hℜe(QL)i at θI , where hℑm(QL)i is 0. We can see the averages
converging to the values predicted by Hybrid Monte-Carlo. When θL is real, we have
the steady lines that represent hℑm(QL)i, while now ℜe(QL) ﬂuctuates around 0,
exactly as expected.
In general the renormalization is of the order of Z(β) ≃ 0.1 [41], so that when
we set θL = 1 we are really working at roughly θ ≃ 0.1. That means in Fig.3.6 θL
is actually quite small and we can mostly see the linear part of (3.84), proportional
to the bare topological susceptibility χL. To be able to observe the eﬀect of higher
powers of θL in (3.84) one needs larger θL. In Fig.3.7 we show the dependence of
hQLi on θI (blue line) and θR (red line) for bigger values of θL. Again, imaginary
and real parts of QL are multiplied by a ” − ” sign and an i, so that they can be
plotted next to each other. Already from the plot it is evident that the two curves

ture, in perfect accord with the opposite sign of the cubic term in (3.84).

We can now use our information about the θ dependence of hQLi to study the
dependence of the bare topological susceptibility on β. Since an increasing value
of β means lower temperature (and also smaller physical volumes), we expect the
susceptibility to decrease. To see this we just have to repeat the ﬁt in (3.85) at
diﬀerent values of β. In Fig.3.8 we show just the data at θR for ﬁxed volume and
increasing temperature (increasing β).

term of the curves in Fig.3.8, are reported in Fig.3.9. Although they are not trivially
connected with the values of the physical renormalized topological susceptibility,
they must have the same qualitative dependence on the temperature. In fact, we
can see that χL decreases as β (temperature) increases, as is the case with the
physical renormalized χ.

3.3.3 Topological charge on SL(3, C) manifold

In the previous section we showed results for the Yang-Mills theory with bare topo-
logical charge. We already mentioned (Sec.(3.2.1)) the correct procedure to deal
with the lattice renormalizations of topological quantities when the gauge group is
SU(3). However, CL at real θ works in the SL(3, C) gauge group which greatly
complicates things not only practically but also conceptually. The very deﬁnition of
topology (reviewed in Sec.(3.1)) relies on the compactness of the gauge group that
generates, for the pure gauge ﬁelds, a precise mapping between the spatial inﬁnity
three-sphere S3 and the group itself. As soon as the gauge group gets enlarged

SU(3) −→ SL(3, C)

(3.86)

it loses its property of compactness and the Yang-Mills part of the action does not
have well deﬁned classical minima any more. Consequently, the operator

(3.87)

Q = Z d4x F ˜F

3.3 Complex Langevin dynamics for SU(3) gauge theory with a θ-term

71

is not expected to assume integer values any more, nor to be invariant under small
deformation of the ﬁelds .

Here we shall discuss some results on the subject that, however, are not complete
yet. First of all we should keep in mind that SU(3) is still sub-group of SL(3, C),
so we should expect to have some sectors where some part of the topological charge
is an integer. Whether the actual topological charge is aﬀected by this sector is
another story and, in fact, we shall see that this is not the case.

It is useful, in order to understand what is going on, to bring up an example
which refers to a much simpler theory. Let us consider a real scalar ﬁeld theory with
a topological term on a circle (S1) :

0 ≤ x < L ,

0 ≤ φ < 2π , φ = φ + 2kπ ,

k ∈ Z ,

where the partition function is

Z = Z Dφ e−S+iθQ ,

and the action and the topological charge are deﬁned as :

S =

1

2Xx

(∂xφ)2 , Q =

1

2πXx

∂xφ .

(3.88)

(3.89)

(3.90)

It is easy to see that the topological charge must be an integer classifying how
many times the ﬁeld φ wraps around itself on the circle. Furthermore, again for CP
reasons, the expectation value of the topological charge must be purely imaginary

hQi =

1

Z Z Dφ e−S i sin(θQ) Q .

In order to use complex Langevin dynamics, we complexify the ﬁeld

φ → φR + i φI ,

(3.91)

(3.92)

where φI is unbounded, and we can write separately the real and imaginary part of
the topological charge

Q =Xx

∂xφR + i Xx

∂xφI = QR + i QI .

(3.93)

The space still being a circle and the real part of the ﬁeld φR periodic, we expect
QR to have the exact same topological meaning of Q for the real theory. However
using CL (see Cap.2), we know that the observables are distributed according to
the equilibrium Fokker-Planck probability distribution function, which is real even
when the ﬁelds are complex

hQi =

1

Z Z Dφ P (θ, φI, φR)(QR + i QI) .

Figure 3.10: Wilson Flow on a SL(3, C) conﬁguration (x axis is ﬂow time) for
θL = 20,

β = 6.1, L = 84.

Since we know, from (3.91), that hQi has to be purely imaginary for real θ, we
have to conclude that hQRi = 0. We conclude that with CL, the contribution
to the average values of the topological charge at real θ comes entirely from the
non-compact imaginary direction and, therefore, has no topological meaning in the
enlarged manifold. Furthermore, the topological charge of the real subgroup, which
still retains the usual topological properties, needs to cancel exactly for every real θ
.

The case of SL(3, C) is completely analogous. Although the topological charge
operator cannot be simply factorised as in (3.93), its properties must be the same.
On the SU(3) subgroup it retains its properties and meaning, but needs to average
to 0. On the other hand, on the complex manifold, Q has no topological meaning
but, provided good convergence of CL, it would average to the correct value.

We would like to observe this on a SL(3, C) conﬁguration. As anticipated, we are
going to employ an extended version of the gradient ﬂow discussed in Sec.((3.2.1)).
That is because, out of all the smoothing methods, the gradient ﬂow seems the
one which can get more naturally extended to SL(3, C) because it doesn’t explicitly
involves any projection on the real manifold.
In Fig.3.10, we show the eﬀect of
the gradient ﬂow on a thermalized conﬁguration at real θL = 20 . In particular, it
is interesting to observe the real part of the topological charge operator (red line)
reaching an integer plateaux, proof that topological sectors are still present in the

3.3 Complex Langevin dynamics for SU(3) gauge theory with a θ-term

73

SU(3) subgroup. The imaginary part of Q, on the other hand, does not stabilise on
any integer value and just ﬂows to (more or less) 0.

Eventually, at ﬂow time t ≃ 3.6, we can see that the gradient ﬂow equation en-
countered an unbounded runaway direction, along which all the quantities diverged.
A consistent application of the gradient ﬂow on the SL(3, C) manifold is still
under work. Its development is essential to extract the correct imaginary part of
the topological charge operator from the conﬁgurations and, therefore, to obtain the
correct value of the renormalized topological charge at real θ.

In this Chapter we reviewed some aspects on the instantons and the structure
of the vacuum of the continuum theory. We discussed the necessity to study topol-
ogy, non-perturbatively, on the lattice and the procedures required to extrapolate
meaningful values of the topological observables. We mentioned why it is relevant to
understand the theory at ﬁnite θ and how this theory is aﬀected by the sign problem
on the lattice. We adopted complex Langevin dynamics as a solution for this and
we showed our results at real θ for the bare theory. We explained the diﬃculties
involved in the extraction of the renormalized topological quantities in the complex-
iﬁed manifold in which CL dynamics takes place. Lastly, we gave an account of our
progress in the direction of solving those problems.

Lefschetz thimbles

In this chapter we are going to introduce another method to deal with sign problem
in lattice quantum ﬁeld theory, i.e.
integration along the Lefschetz thimble. The
starting idea is similar to complex Langevin dynamics. One is faced with an (highly)
oscillatory integral over some real manifold, where the sign problem is severe, and
tries to complexify the degrees of freedom so that in the new complex manifold the
sign problem could be milder or absent. We saw in chapter 2 how complex Langevin
dynamics enlarges the system into the complex manifold. There the probability
distribution function, generated by the Fokker-Plank equation, is real and, provided
the criteria of correctness are satisﬁed and the action is holomorphic, leads the
observables to converge to the right expectation value.

For the Lefschetz thimble, instead, the idea is similar to the one of the saddle-
point approximation. However, here the integral is not approximated by the Taylor
expansion of the complex function around the dominant stationary point. Instead,
the original real domain of integration is deformed into the union of new paths, of
the same dimension, i.e. the Lefschetz thimbles. Each thimble is a sub-manifold of
the complexiﬁed space, with the property of passing through one critical point of
the action. Along them the phase of the integrand is constant, although in general
it has a diﬀerent value on each of them. The union of all the thimbles represents a
deformation of the original real domain. If the function is holomorphic, the integral
over the new paths should have the same (Cauchy theorem) results as over the real
manifold, with the advantage that the phase along the thimbles is constant. The sign
problem, however, has not completely disappeared. A residual sign problem is still
present along each thimble, due to the curvature of the integration contour in the
complexiﬁed space, i.e. the complex Jacobian coming from the parametrisation of
the thimble. A second sign problem appears in the case that more than one thimble
contributes.
In this case one has to take in account that the phases, although
constant, are diﬀerent along each thimble. This is typically referred to as a global
sign problem.

Witten proposed to apply this method to quantum ﬁeld theory [90, 20] and,
since then, much progress has been made in the direction of application to lattice
ﬁeld theory [91, 92, 22]. Mostly studied have been the relativistic Bose gas at ﬁnite

Lefschetz thimbles

chemical potential [21, 93], but also real time quantum mechanics and condense
matter [94, 95].

Since both complex Langevin dynamics and Lefschetz thimble work in the com-
plexiﬁed space, it is very interesting to compare them. In the following we are going
ﬁrst to review the basic theory of the Lefschetz thimbles and, then, compare results
for U(1) 1-link model with a determinant and SU(2) 1-link model.

4.1 Thimble equations

First we are going to introduce the basics of the complexiﬁcation on Lefschetz thim-
bles. Let us consider n real degrees of freedom x = {x1, x2, ..., xn} ∈ Rn that work
as a domain for the complex action S[x] ∈ C. The partition function for this model
is deﬁned, as usual, by the path integral

Z =ZRn

dnx e−S(x) ,

(4.1)

where dnx is the element of inﬁnitesimal volume. As anticipated, the next step is
to complexify the domain of integration, i.e. changing the variables xi → xi + iyi,
while the action is extended to the holomorphic S[zi] = S[xi + iyi]. Thanks to
Picard-Lefschetz/Morse theory [96, 97], then, it is possible to select appropriate n
dimensional sub-manifolds, i.e. the Lefschetz thimbles, immersed into the complex
manifold, along which the integral has the same value as in the original real manifold.
The new contour represent the downward gradient ﬂow associated to the real part

The procedure is to start from the set Σ of critical points {zσ | [∂ziS[z]]z=zσ = 0} and
construct the sub-manifold solution of (4.2) Jσ that originates from those points.

It is useful to look at the one-dimension case, where the original manifold R
gets enlarged into C. Here we know (Cauchy theorem) that we can deform, with
continuity, the original contour of integration as much as we want, as long as S[z]
is holomorphic and the new contour tends to R for x → ±∞. We have no problem,
then, to accept that the integral of e−S[z] along any complex path, respecting those
two conditions, will have the same value as on R. Furthermore, we can write the
thimble equations more explicitly

v(x, y) real functions, and the property of the derivatives ∂
one can show directly that the imaginary part of the action ImS[z(t)] = v(x(t), y(t))
is constant. Let us take its derivative along the thimble

where we substitute the expression (4.5) for ˙x and ˙y. Using the Cauchy Riemann
equations ∂u
∂x = 0, it follows that ˙v(x, y) = 0 which means, of
course, that v(x, y) is constant. In 1 dimension, then, the thimbles method can be
understood more intuitively using simple complex analysis. In higher dimension the
argument is much more complicated but can be proven using Morse theory.

∂y + ∂v

Together with the Lefschetz thimble, one can create another set of sub-manifolds
passing through each critical point zσ and associated, this time, to the upward
gradient ﬂow. Those are path of steepest ascent Kσ, generated by the equation

˙zi = + ∂ziS(z) ,

(4.7)
along which the Morse function −ReS[z] diverges. The unstable thimbles are essen-
tial to know which of the stable ones have to be taken into account to produce a
complete equivalent the original real integration path. The prescription is

nσZσ

(4.8)

Z =Xσ∈Σ

78

Lefschetz thimbles

where nσ is the ’intersection piaring’

nσ = hRn,Kσi .

(4.9)

of the unstable thimble, passing through the critical point zσ, with the original
domain of integration. The product in (4.9) counts the intersection points (or sub-
manifolds) of two manifolds, and the intersection number nσ can be 0 or ±1, selecting
which thimble contributes to the path integral and which not. Again, in the 1
dimensional case one can usually recognise the thimbles contributing just by by
looking at the ones that represent a continuous deformation of the original real
cycle.

The integral over thimbles can be explicitly written as

Zσ = e−i ImS(zσ)Zz(t)∈Jσ

dz(t) e−ReS[z(t)] ,

(4.10)

where the constant imaginary part ei ImS[zσ] has been factorized out of the integral
and generates the global sign problem we anticipated before. The other, more subtle,
residual sign problem comes from the integration measure dz(t). Here, in fact, one
has to take in account the Jacobian coming from integration along the complex
manifold

(4.11)

Dz(t) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∂z

∂t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) dnt ,

which could generate a non trivial sign problem due to the curvature of the thimble.
This sign problem, however, is supposed to be milder than the one at the beginning
and, therefore, can be treated without compromising the measurements [22].

All the results for Lefschetz thimbles (i.e. plots and numerical results) pre-
sented in this chapter are obtained by numerical integration with Mathematica of
the Lefschetz equations (4.3) .

4.2 Thimbles and Langevin dynamics

Here we show a practical example for the application of the Lefschetz thimble method
to a quartic model. We are also going to compare it with the complex Langevin
dynamics approach to the same model. This result appears in the papers [98].

The action we want to examine is

S(z) =

σ
2

z2 +

1
4

z4 + hz,

σ ∈ R, h ∈ C.

(4.12)

where the linear term explicitly breaks parity symmetry z → −z and generates, in
this case, the sign problem. Here the original domain is R and its complexiﬁcation
is the complex plane.

4.2 Thimbles and Langevin dynamics

79

The complex Langevin dynamics have been discussed in Cap.2. Here let us just

recall that the equation for z reads

˙z = −∂zS(z) + η,

or explicitly

˙x = −Re ∂zS(z) + η,
˙y = −Im ∂zS(z),

where η is real gaussian noise obeying

hηi = 0,
hη2i = 2.

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

The Langevin equations (4.14) generate a real probability distribution function
P (x, y) over the complex plane,

Z =Z dxdy P (x, y) ,

(4.16)

which is the solution of the Fokker-Plank equation associated to (4.14).

First of all we should note how the classical (i.e. without noise η) CL equation
(4.13) is the complex conjugate of the thimble equation (4.2), i.e. the imaginary
part has opposite sign. That leads to some important diﬀerences regarding stability
of some trajectories.
In particular, thimbles that ﬂow to inﬁnity in the imagi-
nary direction coincide with run-away solutions of the classical CL equations. We
saw (Cap.2), however, that those kind of trajectories can always be avoided in the
stochastic process (i.e. with noise η) by an appropriate choice of the CL integration
stepsize.

Another obvious diﬀerence is that CL dynamics takes place in the whole com-
plexiﬁed manifold, in this case the complex plane, doubling the degrees of freedom
of the original problem. The Lefschetz thimbles, on the other hand, are a complex
sub-manifold of the complexiﬁed domain, but they have the same dimension of the
original domain of integration.

Those two points combined together also imply that the critical points, where
∂zS(z)|z=zk = 0, have diﬀerent properties in the two approaches. From the point of
view of the Lefschetz thimble, a non-degenerate critical point has to sit on a saddle
point because, from (4.4), it has to be a maximum for the stable thimble and a
minimum for the unstable one.

i.e. the Hessian matrix in these points ∂2

can be diagonalised and its
eigenvalues are half positive and half negative. This property is essential to allow
both the stable and the unstable thimble to be associated with these points.

For complex Langevin dynamics, instead, each critical point is either a relative
maximum or a relative minimum. That means that the drift is either attractive or

(4.17)

From the Lefschetz thimble point of view each of the three points have one stable
an one unstable direction. For CL, on the other hand, only the ﬁrst one is attractive
while the other two are repulsive (as one can see in Fig.4.1).

Here we can see that the two thimble contributing, i.e. the ones whose connected
unstable thimbles (red dashed lines) intersect the real axes, are clearly a deformation
of the R contour with the limit at x → ±∞ ﬁxed. That fact that the two thimbles
go to inﬁnity in the y direction should not worry since in that region of the complex
plane the integrand vanishes. One can see this by noticing that for large z = reiθ
the dominant contribution to ReS comes from the z4 term. In particular, ReS is
positive in the regions cos(4θ) > 0, i.e. where − π
2 , which,
for k = 3 that is exactly the region where the two thimbles go to inﬁnity. This is
general, i.e. the stable thimbles always in the region where ReS → +∞, otherwise
the integral on it would not be ﬁnite, while the unstable ones always in the regions
where ReS → −∞ .

Figure 4.2: Quartic model, with σ = 1 and h = 1 + i. Histogram collected during a
complex Langevin simulation (left) and a comparison with the thimbles (right).

For what concerns CL, this model has been studied in detail in [57] in the case
of σ ∈ C and h = 0. For the purpose of this section we just have to notice that
two of the three critical points are repulsive, so that we expect CL dynamics to
avoid the ﬁrst two and concentrate somewhere near the third one. Furthermore, as
mentioned earlier, thimbles that ﬂows to ±∞ in the imaginary direction, correspond
to runaway solution of the classical CL drift due to the complex conjugate equation
of motion in the two models. Those trajectories, however, are avoided when the
process is made stochastic. For the same reason, when the thimbles are parallel to
the real axis, their attractive ﬂow coincide with the CL one.

We have now all the instruments to understand Fig.(4.2). It shows Lefschetz
thimbles in the complex plane together with the history of CL dynamics. We can
clearly see that CL tends to follow the thimbles when they ﬂow mainly in the real
direction, while it strongly departs from them when they start to pick a relevant
imaginary component. We can also observe the expected cluster of CL dynamics
around the only attractive point (see histogram in the left part of Fig.(4.2)) while,
of course, the repulsive ones are avoided.

We have veriﬁed that integration along the two contributing thimbles yealds to
the right result. In particular Z1 = 1.744 + i0.461 and Z2 = 0.021 + i0.426, which
leads to the correct sum Z = Z1 + Z2 = 1.765 + i0.887. For a numerical comparison
with complex Langevin see the table (4.1).

We can conclude this section saying that knowing the Lefschetz thimbles struc-
ture of a complexiﬁed theory, at least in simple cases, gives very precise information
about the CL dynamics distribution in the complex plane. The two methods, how-
ever, are far away from being in a one to one relation especially in the presence of
a repulsive ﬁxed point.

In the following we will extend this comparison to simple gauge models.

82

Lefschetz thimbles

4.3 U(1) model with determinant

It is interesting to study a simple one-link abelian model, with link U = eix, with a
QCD-like determinant in the action. This model has been studied in the paper [99]
speciﬁcally for the complex Langevin dynamics part. Here, instead, our goal is the
comparison between CL dynamics and Lefschetz thimbles. The partition function
of this theory is

Z =ZU(1)

dU e−SB det M =Z π

−π

dx
2π

eβ cos x [1 + κ cos(x − iµ)] ,

(4.18)

where β is taken real and positive like the gauge coupling and the complex weight
is introduced by the determinant [det M(µ)]∗ = det M(−µ∗), via the chemical po-
tential µ like in QCD. We observe, already at µ = 0, that when κ < 1 the weight
is real and positive, while for κ > 1 there is already a sign problem. Furthermore,
after the exponentiation of det M, the action we are left with is not holomorphic
any more,

S(z) = −β cos z − ln [1 + κ cos(z − iµ)] ,

(4.19)

which is reﬂected in the drift ∂zS(z) having poles where the determinant 1+κ cos(z−
iµ) is zero :

∂zS(z) = β sin z +

κ sin(z − iµ)

1 + κ cos(z − iµ)

.

(4.20)

Violation of holomorphicity needs to be treated very carefully both in complex
Langevin dynamics and in the Lefschetz thimble method. In the ﬁrst case it invali-
dates the formal proof of convergence and it might lead to convergence to the wrong
results [100, 58]. In the thimbles case it might compromise the deformation of the
original contour of integration. However, as we shall see, the thimbles usually ends
on the poles so that the integral over the contour is not aﬀected by it. Moreover, in
the case of multi-branched functions, one thimble is not expected to trespass in a
branch diﬀerent than the one where its critical point lies, as to do so it would need
to cross a singularity.

Nevertheless, it is very important to test those two methods, and in general
every method that aims to solve the sign problem, in the case where the action of
the theory is non-holomorphic, since this is the case for full QCD. In this sense, this
simple model is a very useful toy model since it can be solved analytically. In fact,
the partition function and every power of the trace of the link hcosn(x)i are linear
combination of modiﬁed Bessel functions

Z = I0(β) + κI1(β) cosh µ,

κ cosh µ (I2(β) + I0(β))(cid:21) .

The goal will then be confronting our numerical results with the exact ones.

for κ > 1 solutions at diﬀerent xc are possible. The same happens for the singular
points (4.24). Here we can see explicitly that for κ ≤ 1 only solutions with xs = ±π

and cos(xs) = 1/κ become acceptable as well. The situation is captured in Fig.4.3,
where ﬁxed points (singular point) are indicated with blue circles (red squares).

In this case, it is possible to gain some analytical insight about the thimbles.

Again we need do separate the case of κ ≤ 1 and κ > 1.

• κ ≤ 1 :

this is the case where critical points are only at xc = 0, = ±π and poles at
xc = ±π. We will see that we one can tell which are the relevant thimbles just
by looking at the action. Let us start with the critical point in xc = 0. Here
we found the action (4.19) along the imaginary direction

S(0 + iy) = − [β cosh(y) + ln (1 + κ cosh(y − µ))]

(4.25)

to be completely real and unbounded from below as y → ±∞. This means
the y axis is the
that ImS(0 + iy) = 0 and the integral is divergent, i.e.
unstable thimble. Since the y axis deﬁnitely crosses the x axis, we expect the
stable thimble associated with xc = 0 to be relevant for the integral.
Similar is the case of the thimble associated to xc = ±π. The action here reads
(4.26)

S(±π + iy) = β cosh(y) − ln (1 − k cosh(y − µ)) .

Since we are in the case of k ≤ 1, ImS(±π + iy) is again constant along
the y axis and its value only depends on y. When cosh(y − µ) < 1/κ, in
fact, ImS = 0, otherwise ImS = ±π. The interesting fact here is that the
value of ImS jumps in correspondence of the singularities at xs = ±π and
cosh(ys − µ) = 1/κ.

4.3 U(1) model with determinant

85

About the contribution of the thimble : we can see that in the regions x =
±∞, y → ±∞, the action S → +∞ so that the integral is convergent there and
the thimbles are the stable ones. However, because they are exactly parallel
to the y axis, they cannot be a deformation of the original real axis, i.e. they
cannot contribute to the integral.

• κ > 1 :

this is the case where some of the repulsive ﬁxed points move away from
x = ±π, while also the singular drift is no longer at x = ±π, but instead at
y = µ and x = xs such that cos xs = −1/κ. Here the stable thimbles that
ﬂow to y → +∞ are not parallel to the y axis any more. Furthermore, they
manage to connect with the stable thimble connected to xc = 0 in the sense
that they both end at the singularity, where the imaginary part of the action
has a jump. In this way they belong to the deformation of the real axis, so
that now they will need to be considered for the integral. Those thimbles,
though, are too complicated to be expressed in an analytic form.

This is illustrated in Fig.4.3. In both cases the results, obtained by summing the
integral over all the thimbles that contribute, agree with the exact result (4.21), pro-
vided both the residual phase factor and the global phase phase factor are correctly
incorporated.

For what concerns complex Langevin dynamics the critical point in xc = 0 ia
always attractive, while the others are repulsive. We can try to guess the CL scatter
plot from the thimble structure, the same exercise we did for the quartic model.

• κ ≤ 1 :

close the critical point at xc = 0 the thimble is mostly parallel to the x axis,
so CL classical drift has the same direction of the thimble ﬂow. Furthermore,
the latter approaches the critical point from above, that means the imaginary
component of CL drift, i.e. the complex conjugation of the thimble ﬂow equa-
tions, will point towards the positive y direction. Then, we expect CL scatter
plot to be clustered following the thimble around the attractive ﬁxed point at
xc = 0 and, more precisely, to be mostly above it.
The other stable thimbles at x = ±π are parallel to the y axes, which corre-
sponds to run-away solutions for CL. We expect then the latter to avoid those
trajectories.
In Fig.4.4 (up) we see that, as expected, the CL dynamics stays over the main
thimble around the ﬁxed point at xc = 0. Moreover the compactness of its
distribution and the fact that it stays away from the poles (red squares) leads
to the correct results (see Table (4.1)) at least for low moments hcosn(x)i, with
small n [99] .

• κ > 1 :

in this case the thimble connected with xc = 0 is much less ﬂat in the y

86

Lefschetz thimbles

direction. Also two of the stable thimbles, previously localised at x = ±π,
move towards the centre and and join the main thimble. Altogether this
necessarily leads to a much stronger classical complex Langevin drift in the
y direction. The resulting scattering plot (Fig.4.4 down) is, therefore, wider
spread into the complex plane. Moreover, also the poles are closer to the
attractive ﬁxed point and, this time, CL dynamics manages to reach them.
In this case CL dynamics is found not to be able to reproduce the correct results
(see Table (4.1)) even for the low momenta. Since the poles are immersed in
the distribution the arguments in [100] and [54], relying in holomorphicity,
break down.

To summarise, we ﬁnd that in the presence of a determinant the ﬂow has singular
points. For Langevin dynamics, this leads to a breakdown of the formal justiﬁcation
and possible wrong results in practice. For the Lefschetz approach, we ﬁnd that
thimbles may end at singular points and the imaginary part of the action jumps by
a constant. Hence, we observed for the ﬁrst time in[98], if there is more than one
contributing thimble, they connect either at |z| → ∞ or at a singularity.

4.4 SU(2) 1-link model

We now extend the analysis to the case of a SU(2) one link model,

Z =Z dU exp(cid:20)β

2

TrU(cid:21) ,

β ∈ C,

U ∈ SU(2).

(4.27)

This time the sign problem is introduced by a complex β instead of a determinant.
This model is again analytically solvable due to the fact that the action only depends
on the trace of the link U. It is, therefore, invariant under any change of basis of
U → RUR−1 and this allow to diagonalize the link making its dependence from an
angle φ explicit

U(φ,−→n ) = eiωaσa = cos(φ)1 + i sin(φ)naσa,
TrU = 2 cos φ,

(4.28)

where σa are the Pauli matrices, φ = √ωaωa and na = ωa/φ. For convenience, we
will refer to this formulation as the ’angle representation’. In this case one has also
to consider the change in the Haar measure for the partition function

is the integration of the uniform angular measure on the unit sphere,

(4.30)

Diagonalizing the link U corresponds to a complete gauge ﬁxing in the sense that
the degrees of freedom of the model are reduced from three to one. A detailed
study of the eﬀect of coordinate changing on complex Langevin dynamics, including
this model, has been done in [56]. There it is shown how the introduction of a
Haar measure, dictated by the coordinate change, can help the convergence of the
dynamics and, therefore, it is a useful tool associated with CL.

The other main way to control CL dynamics is gauge cooling (see cap.2). The
latter does not require an explicit gauge ﬁxing and it is employed when the dynamics
takes place in the full gauge group.

Although, obviously, in both cases the model is the same, from the perspective
of CL dynamics they are completely diﬀerent.
In the ﬁrst case the space to be
explored is the strip : −π < Reφ < π, −∞ < Imφ < ∞ of the complex plane ,

4.4 SU(2) 1-link model

89

while in the second case it is the complex group SL(2, C) . In the following we will
compare both approaches with the Lefschetz thimble method. The latter can be
computed exactly in the angle representation and directly compared with CL in the
same representation. Then, it can be mapped into the TrU plane to be confronted
with the case in which CL dynamics takes place into the whole SL(2, C) group.

with

S(z) = −β cos z − 2 ln sin z.

(4.31)

(4.32)

Similar to the determinant for the U(1) model, the Haar measure introduces a
logarithm in the action which makes it non-holomorphic. As usual we need to
identify the critical points and the poles of the drift

−∂zS(z) = −β sin z + 2

cos z
sin z

.

Hence, the ﬁxed points are

cos z±c = −

while the poles satisfy

sin x cosh y + i sinh y cos x = 0,

(4.33)

(4.34)

(4.35)

which are the points xs = 0,±π and ys = 0.
If we integrate numerically the thimble equations we obtain the picture in Fig.4.5
(left). The plot respects the parity symmetry and, as expected, the stable thimbles
contributing (solid blue lines) are the ones that form a deformation of the original
contour x ∈ R, x ∈ (−π, π] . We can also map the results into the TrU = 2 cos z
plane, see Fig.4.5 (right) to compare it with complex Langevin dynamics in the
gauge formulation.

91

In Fig.4.7 we show a comparison between thimbles and the histogram of CL
dynamics. We notice that CL stays very close to the thimble lines. Once more, we
can appreciate how the complex conjugate drift leads CL dynamics to stay mostly
below the thimble when this is concave, and mostly above when this is convex. Also
they are connected with two repulsive ﬁxed points, from the point of view of CL.

The two non-contributing thimble are ignored by CL. That is because they are
far away from the two central attractive points and mostly oriented in the y direction,
i.e. they coincide with run-away trajectories avoided by CL.

We can clearly see how the distribution of CL dynamics into the complex plane
is compact. Furthermore we can see from Fig.4.5(left) that the poles are avoided
in the angle representation, while in the matrix representation for CL (right) the
action has no poles to begin with. This, as expected, is reﬂected in the convergence
to the right results (as we can see in Table (4.1)).

4.4.2 Gauge dynamics with cooling

As anticipated, we will study the same model but from a diﬀerent approach for what
concerns complex Langevin dynamics. This time we will not impose any gauge ﬁxing
and let CL free to explore the SL(2, C) space. We will use, though, gauge cooling
to control the dynamics.

This approach is more expensive in terms of computing time, but has the ad-
vantage of being more easily generalised to the 4d case. Also if the gauge is not
ﬁxed, the Haar measure is not needed any more and the action is holomorphic.

Complex Langevin dynamics for gauge theories have been reviewed in Cap.2.

Here we will just brieﬂy recall the evolution equation

U(t + ǫ) = R(t)U(t), R = exp(cid:2)iσa(cid:0)ǫKa + √ǫηa(cid:1)(cid:3) ,

where t is the (discretised) Langevin time, Ka = −DaS is the drift and σa are the
Pauli matrices. Application of gauge cooling is necessary to control the width of the
distribution in the complex direction. This process is orthogonal to the dynamics
of the system and it can be implemented an arbitrary number of times between two
consecutive CL updates. The single steps can be expressed as

(4.36)

U′(t) = Ωgc(α)U(t)Ω−1

gc (α),

(4.37)

where parameter α regulates the intensity of the cooling. The number of steps is
decided in such a way that the balance is optimal between eﬀectiveness of gauge
cooling and computer time usage.

We can see in Fig.4.8 that increasing the number of cooling steps progressively
improves the compactness of the distribution of TrU in the complex plane. However
one can clearly see a jump at 2 gauge cooling steps. That results in hTrUiCL to
converge to the right results (see Table (4.1)) for number of gauge cooling steps ≥ 2.

4.4 SU(2) 1-link model

93

Lastly we are going to analyse the case when β2 = −1 (and hence β is purely
imaginary). Here the ﬁxed point zd, with cos zd = −1/β = ±i, is degenerate in
the sense that the Hessian | ∂S
∂z2|z=zd = 0. The choice of imaginary β is motivated
by dynamics in real (Minkowskian) time, see e.g. Refs. [101, 102, 65] for complex
Langevin studies. For degenerate ﬁxed points the standard reasoning to justify the
Lefschetz approach and construct the thimbles by numerical integration is not well
deﬁned. Here we give a brief analysis.

At the ﬁxed point the action is real, with S(zd) = 1 − ln 2. We take β = i and

write

1
2

TrU = cos z = u + iv.

Equating the imaginary part of the action,

ImS = −u − φ,

tan φ =

−2uv

1 − u2 + v2 ,

to 0, then yields the thimbles, and we ﬁnd

v±(u) =

1

tan u(cid:18)u ±qu2 − (1 − u2) tan2 u(cid:19) ,

(4.38)

(4.39)

(4.40)

where 0 < u < 1 for v−(u) and −1 < u < 0 for v+(u). These two branches make up
the stable thimble. The unstable thimble is given by u = 0, for which the imaginary
part of the action vanishes as well.

The thimbles are shown in Fig.4.9 (right), using the same colour coding as above.
They are a deformation of the thimbles for general complex β, shown earlier, satis-
fying reﬂection symmetry in the ReTrU = 0 axis. We have veriﬁed that integrating
along the thimble, with the inclusion of the residual phase, gives the correct answer.
The Langevin histogram is shown in Fig. 4.9 (left). A similar histogram was ob-
tained earlier in Ref. [65]. A comparison between the histogram and the thimbles is
ﬁnally given in Fig. 4.9 (right). For this case we note that the distribution does not
overlap substantially with the thimble and that again the distribution of the weight
for both approaches is quite diﬀerent.

In conclusion the aim of this chapter was to compare two of the most promising
methods to deal with the sign problem in Lattice quantum ﬁeld theory, i.e. complex
Langevin dynamics and Lefschetz thimble. We examined several models that present
a sign problem. Those were simple enough to be solved analytically but interesting
enough to capture some important characteristics of more complicated gauge the-
ories. We started with a quartic model to ﬁx the ideas about Lefschetz thimbles
and to set the parameters of comparison between the latter and complex Langevin

matrix representation, having the result already in the gauge ﬁxed representation.

dynamics. We proceeded by examining a one-link U(1) model with a determinant.
Here the sign problem was introduced by chemical potential µ, in analogy with full
QCD.

Lastly we looked at the case of one-link SU(2) model with complex β parameter.
This model could be approached in two diﬀerent ways by CL. One way was to ﬁx
the gauge and study the dynamics in the lower dimensional parameter space. The
other was to let CL free to explore all the complexiﬁed gauge degrees of freedom and
control the dynamics with gauge cooling. Both approaches have been confronted
with the thimbles method and found to converge to the right results.

About the comparison of the two methods, we found that the study of the
Lefschetz thimbles is strictly connected with CL dynamics. The reason for this is
that the two share the same critical points and their equation of motion are the
complex conjugate of the other. Knowing the thimbles structures, therefore, allows
one to have the exact information of the classical CL drift along the thimbles lines
connecting the ﬁxed points.

The ﬁxed point in the Lefschetz thimble formulation have always an attractive
direction and a repulsive one. On the other hand, for CL they can be completely
attractive or completely repulsive. However, knowing the thimbles ﬂow near the
ﬁxed points allows to establish exactly what kind of ﬁxed point they are in the CL
formulation.

We also showed, when there are poles involved, that they are the endpoint of
some thimbles while, for CL dynamics, they are quite dangerous and threaten the
good convergence whenever they are immersed into the dynamics.

Altogether we show that, starting from the Lefschetz thimble picture, one can

make prediction on the CL dynamics with some accuracy.

Chapter 5

Density of States

In the previous chapters we have discussed complex Langevin dynamics and Lef-
schetz thimbles as methods to deal with the sign problem in quantum ﬁeld theory.
In this last chapter we are going to review another promising approach to the same
problem, i.e. the density of states (DOS) approach. The idea is to construct the
density of states of a given theory in the canonical, or grand-canonical, fashion. An
eﬃcient way has been developed in [103] for discrete systems, and then generalised
to quantum ﬁeld theories with continuous energy spectrum [104, 24, 25, 105, 106,
108, 109, 107]. Standard Monte-Carlo methods are highly developed tools when it
comes to measure expectation values of observables on theories with a real and posi-
tive Boltzmann weight e−S. However, they do not allow direct computation of some
extensive quantities such as the free energy or the partition function. Furthermore,
as stressed many times before, they become ineﬃcient when the theory is aﬀected
by a sign problem.

On the other hand, the density of state method is naturally suitable for calculat-
ing extensive quantities. Moreover, as we shall see in the following, it automatically
reduces the sign problem of the full quantum ﬁeld theory to one in a one-dimensional
oscillating integral.

5.1 Description of the method

Let us consider the partition function

Z(β) =Z Dφ exp(−βS[φ]),

(5.1)

where φ is a generic ﬁeld. As always, we can identify the Euclidean action S[φ] with
the ’energy’ of the ﬁeld conﬁguration. In analogy with the canonical ensemble in

97

98

Density of States

Statistical Mechanics one can deﬁne the number of states having energy E

ρ(E) =Z [Dφ] δ (S[φ] − E) ,

(5.2)

where δ() is the Dirac delta function. The partition function can then be expressed
as the integral of the density over the energy, weighted with the Boltzmann factor :

Z(β) =Z dE ρ(E)e−βE.

(5.3)

Any expectation value that can be expressed as an explicit function of the energy,
can also be computed

hO(E)i =

1

ZZ dE O(E)ρ(E)e−βE.

(5.4)

In practice it is not possible to know ρ(E) for every value of E in a continuum
system. Therefore, in the simulations, we will divide the energy spectrum in small
intervals [E0 − ∆, E0 + ∆] of with 2∆, with E0 the central value of. Moreover, we
would like to have an analytic expression for ρ(E) inside each interval so that we
can employ a piecewise deﬁnition of the density of states

ρi(E),

(5.5)

bρ(E) =Xi

where ρi is deﬁned only inside the interval [Ei − ∆, Ei + ∆].
In principle, if the intervals are small enough, it is perfectly acceptable to replace
a regular function with its linear approximation, up to order ∆2. However, we
know that ρ(E) can vary over many orders of magnitude depending on the range of
energies considered. It is more convenient, then, to linearly approximate the natural
logarithm of the DOS, in each interval, and then exponentiate the piecewise function
to construct ρ(E).

The piecewise deﬁned logarithm has the form

ln ρ(E) = C(Ei) + a(Ei)(E − Ei) + O(∆2), E ∈ [Ei − ∆, Ei + ∆]

(5.6)

so that the DOS can be written as

ρ(E) = Cexp(Ei)ea(Ei)(E−Ei) + O(∆2), E ∈ [Ei − ∆, Ei + ∆].

(5.7)

The parameter a(Ei), the slope of the linear approximation of ln ρ(E), is the core
focus of this approach and is the only quantity that has to be numerically computed.
We shall discuss it in more detail below. The factor C(Ei) is a constant in each
interval, whose function is to set ln ρ(E) at the right value in each interval.

5.1 Description of the method

5.1.1 LLR algorithm

99

We shall now describe the LLR (Langfeld-Lucini-Rago or linear local relaxation)
algorithm. It has speciﬁcally been created in order to compute the density of states
of systems with a continuous energy spectrum.

As mention before, one is interested in computing the quantity a(Ei) in the
interval [Ei − ∆, Ei + ∆]. The way to achieve this is to insert the inverse of (5.7)
into the partition function, and tune the value of a(Ei) to a∗(Ei) in such a way that
the density of states is annihilated in the interval, i.e.

ρexact(E)e−a∗(Ei)E = 1,

(5.8)

up to order ∆2 . This automatically gives an estimate of the number of states itself

ea∗(Ei)E = ρest(E),

E ∈ [Ei − ∆, Ei + ∆].

(5.9)

To carry out this process, we need to introduce a probe function f (E), of which the
expectation value can be measured in the interval

Fi(a) = hhf (E)iii,a =

1

Za(Ei)Z Ei+∆

Ei−∆

dE f (E)ρ(E)e−aE,

(5.10)

where hh iii,a means the average value in the interval Ei at ﬁxed parameter a, and
Za(Ei) is the partition function restricted to the same interval which also depends
on the parameter a

Za(Ei) =Z Ei+∆

Ei−∆

dE ρ(E)e−aE.

(5.11)

Let us note that Za(Ei) is just the normalization in the Monte Carlo restricted to
the intervals, and has nothing to do with the partition function of the system which
is deﬁned in (5.3).

At this point, the idea is to choose f (E) in such a way that its expectation
value is a good indicator to establish when ρ(E)e−a∗(Ei)E = 1. The simplest and
more eﬃcient choice is the energy itself or, more precisely, f (E) = E − Ei

1

Za(Ei)Z Ei+∆

Ei−∆

δE(a(Ei)) = hhE − Eiiia =

dE (E − Ei)ρ(E)e−aE.

(5.12)

From the point of view of the algorithm, we compute δE(a(Ei)) with a standard
Monte Carlo in each interval [Ei − ∆, Ei + ∆]. Every time, before proposing a new
conﬁguration to the Monte Carlo, we check if the energy Enew of the conﬁguration
is inside the interval [Ei − ∆, Ei + ∆] and if it is not, we reject the conﬁguration.
A slightly better implementation, that is not manifestly non ergodic, is to consider
’gaussian tails’ attached to the extremities of each interval. In this way a conﬁgu-
ration, which energy is out of the given interval, can still be proposed to the Monte

100

Density of States

Carlo with a probability of exp[Enew − (Ei ± ∆)]2, where the ± depends whether
Enew is bigger than Ei + ∆ or lower than Ei − ∆.
Going back to the description of the the LLR method, one can see that, when
(5.8) is satisﬁed, equation (5.10) implies that

δE(a∗(Ei)) = 0.

(5.13)

We are, then, looking for an iterative process that changes a(Ei) towards the zero of
δE(a). This is a classic one-dimensional root ﬁnding problem, with the complication
that the value of our function, the energy, is known as a result of a Monte-Carlo
simulation, i.e. it cannot be computed directly but only estimated via noisy obser-
vation.

Stochastic approximation methods are algorithms developed precisely for this
purpose. The Robbins-Monro algorithm [110] is the ﬁrst of these class, and it is a
simple adaptation of the famous Newton-Raphson root ﬁnding method for determin-
istic functions. According to the Robbins-Monro method, it is possible to achieve
convergence in the root ﬁnding of a noisy function.

The n + 1 iteration of Robbins-Monro can be written as
an+1 = an − dn δE(an),

where the coeﬃcient dn must obey the constraints

(5.22)

Let us conclude this part with an important remark. Even though the proof of
convergence of the Robbins-Monro method is valid for any initial value a0, in practice
starting from a random a0 would introduce an oﬀset impossible to eliminate due to
the fact that at large n the contribution of dn is suppressed. The solution of this
problem is introducing some steps of thermalization for the an. For example, a simple
way we adopted is to start with the Newton-Raphson algorithm, i.e. dn = d. In this
case the an are rapidly brought around the value a∗ since there is no suppression of
the coeﬃcient dn. Once the an ﬂuctuate around a ﬁxed value then one can switch

102

Density of States

to the Robbins-Monro method. An example of what we discussed can be seen in
Fig.5.1. Clearly starting from a value a0 far away from a∗ prevents the Robbins-
Monro to reach the right result in a sensible time (black line), even thought he
correct asymptotic behaviour should still be reached. Let us note that the number
of iterations in the Fig.5.1 is already two thousands. On the other hand, if we
start with just 30 steps of Newton-Raphson as thermalization, the Robbins-Monro
stabilizes very fast on the asymptotic value of a∗ (red line), which yields for the
correct results.

Once the a∗(Ei) are known for a range of energies large enough, the density
of states can be build and the other observables, depending on E, can be easily
computed.

Clearly, this all procedures requires ρ(E) to refer to a real weight e−S for (5.12) to
be able to be computed with a Monte Carlo. As we shall see in the following section,
the way to extend the method to the complex case is to separate the imaginary part
of the action from the real one, and compute the DOS relative only to the imaginary
part.

5.2 Relativistic Bose gas at ﬁnite chemical poten-

tial µ

In this section we are going to discuss the application of the LLR method to the case
of a four dimensional complex scalar ﬁeld theory at ﬁnite density, i.e. the Bose gas.
A ﬁnite real chemical potential introduces a sign problem in this theory. This model
has been extensively studied in literature with diﬀerent approaches like complex
Langevin dynamics [112, 15], Lefschetz thimble [21], dual formulation on ﬂux tubes
[114] and extended mean ﬁeld theory [113].

Because it is one of the simplest quantum ﬁeld theories and because of the great
amount of results present in the literature, the relativistic Bose gas at ﬁnite density
is one of the best models to test new algorithms that deal with sign problem.

We will start by recalling the Euclidian action in the continuum

S =Z d4x (cid:2)(∂4 − µ)φ†(∂4 + µ)φ + ∂iφ†∂iφ + m2|φ|2 + λ|φ|4(cid:3) ,

(5.23)

from which it is clear how the chemical potential enters as an imaginary tempo-
ral component of a gauge ﬁeld A0. This fact is important when it comes to the
discretization on the lattice.

The (5.23) can be written as

S =Z d4x (cid:2)∂νφ†∂νφ + (m2 − µ2)|φ|2 + λ|φ|4 + µ(φ†(∂4φ) − (∂4φ†)φ)(cid:3) , (5.24)

5.2 Relativistic Bose gas at ﬁnite chemical potential µ

103

where the chemical potential explicitly couples to the conserved charge j4 = φ†∂4φ−
∂4φ†φ associated to the global U(1) symmetry. Furthermore, it determines a shift
in the mass parameter which, for ﬁnite λ and µ large enough, is responsible for the
symmetry broken phase (Mexican hat potential).

However, the naive discretization of (5.24) would not work because it loses this
characteristic of the chemical potential. Instead, the correct way to discretize the
action is to write :

S =X"(2d + m2)φ∗xφ + λ(φ∗xφ)2 −

4Xν=1

(φ∗xe−µδν,4φx+bν + φ∗x+bνeµδν,4φx)# . (5.25)

The sum is over the sites of an N 3
s Nt lattice, with periodic boundary conditions in
all the directions, d = 4 is the number of dimensions, and m is the bare mass. Let
us note how the piece φ∗xe−µφx+b4 + φ∗x+b4
eµφx is complex. We can rewrite (5.25) in
terms of the real and imaginary part of the ﬁeld φ = 1√2

(5.26)

where a summation over repeated indices is intended. The completely antisymmetric
tensor ǫab follows the prescriptions ǫ12 = −ǫ21 = 1 and ǫ11 = ǫ22 = 0.

The operator number of particles on the lattice is

nx =

dµ

ln Z|µ=0 = (δab sinh µ − iǫab cosh µ) φa,xφb,x+b4,

(5.27)

which corresponds to the Noether current at µ = 0.

Since here we are mostly interested in the sign problem, we will ﬁx, once and
for all, the parameters m = λ = 1, and every result we are going to show will follow
the the same prescription.

5.2.1 Generalised density of states

Our goal is to build the density of states for this theory. First of all we will consider
separately real and imaginary part of the action

S[φ] = SR[φ, µ] + iκ(µ)SI[φ],

where

SI[φ] =Xx (cid:2)φ1,xφ2,x+b4 − φ2,xφ1,x+b4(cid:3) .

Figure 5.2: Distribution of the a∗(N) for L = 84 and µ = 0.9.

Then we will generalise the procedures reviewed in Sec.5.1 in analogy with the Grand
Canonical ensemble. Let us note that in (5.28) κ(µ) = sinh(µ) and SR[φ, µ] has a
built-in dependence on cosh(µ).

The idea is to elect SI[φ] = NI as ’imaginary’ number of particle so that we can

write the partition function

Z =XNI Z dφ δ(SI[φ] − NI)e−SR[φ,µ]e−iκ(µ)SI [φ].

(5.30)

It is important to note that, in this formulation, what we called NI is not the actual
number of particles, but just the value of the imaginary part of the action. For
this reason it will not take integer values and, in fact, can be any number NI ∈ R.
Furthermore, NI is an extensive quantity and therefore can be written as NI = nIΩ,
where Ω is the 4 dimensional volume.

We are, then, able to numerically compute the DOS at ﬁxed NI

ρ(NI; µ) =Z dφ δ(SI[φ] − NI)e−SR[φ,µ].

(5.31)

Since the imaginary number of particle is a continuum, we can adopt for the
DOS, the same deﬁnition as for the Canonical case (5.7) with the only diﬀerence
that now the variable is NI. To ease the notation, from now on we are going to
rename N ≡ NI. In complete analogy with the energy case, the logarithm of the
DOS is a piecewise function deﬁned in the intervals N ∈ [Ni − ∆, Ni + ∆], where Ni
is the centre of the i-th interval.

5.2 Relativistic Bose gas at ﬁnite chemical potential µ

105

The partition function is then the Fourier transform of the DOS

Z =Z ∞

−∞

dN ρ(N; µ)e−iκ(µ)N .

(5.32)

The LLR algorithm is also fundamentally the same as the canonical case. As
before, we want to numerically compute the a∗(Ni) in (5.9), and the observable we
use in the process is the imaginary part of the action N = SI[φ]

∆N(a) = hhN − Niiia =

1

ZiZ Ni+∆

Ni−∆

dN (N − Ni)ρ(N; µ)e−aN .

(5.33)

As explained before, the root ﬁnding process for a∗(Ni) is implemented separately
in each interval [Ni − ∆, Ni + ∆].
Let us remark that under charge conjugation the imaginary part of the action
changes sign SI[φ] → −SI[φ†] while the real part remains the same, for this reason
the density of states has to be even in N

ρ(N; µ) = ρ(−N; µ).

For the same argument a(N) has to be odd

a(N) =

d
dN

ln ρ(N; µ) = −a(−N),

(5.34)

(5.35)

which means that we really need only informations from N ∈ [0,∞], and the parti-
tion function can be written as

Z = 2Z ∞

dN ρ(N; µ) cos(κ(µ)N).

In Fig.5.2 we show an example of the typical distribution of

a∗(Ni) =

d
dN

ln ρ(N; µ)|N =Ni, µ = 0.9,

(5.36)

(5.37)

for the Bose gas. We observe an initial approximately linear slope, which means
the dominant contribution to ρ(N; µ) is gaussian, as we can see integrating (5.37).
Such gaussian behaviour for a generalised DOS has been already observed for the
Z3 model with complex action in [106, 107]. Here, though, we can see the a∗(Ni)
suddenly change trend at a larger value of N, and stabilize to a less steep slope.

This behaviour of a∗(N) is quite general, and appears the same at diﬀerent
values of µ and volumes. In fact, it is useful to look, in Fig.5.3, at the dependence
of a∗(N) from the chemical potential to gain some insight on the severity of the sign
problem. We can see how the initial linear behaviour is common at every chemical
potential, but the higher is the value of µ the earlier they will depart from it to
settle on the other slope. The latter has, again, the same inclination at every µ and
it just diﬀers only for the shift.

Figure 5.3: Dependence of a∗(N) on the chemical potential µ for L = 84.

The behaviour in Fig.5.3, together with the obvious increase in frequency of the
cos(κ(µ)N) in (5.36), contribute to the severity of the sign problem. In fact, let us
suppose for a moment that the oscillation was constant at every µ

Z =Z dNρ(N; µ) cos(ωN),

with

d
dµ

ω = 0.

(5.38)

(5.39)

The DOS at zero chemical potential ρ(N; µ = 0), generated by the black dots in
Fig.5.3, would suppress the oscillation cos(ωN) more than ρ(N; µ = 1.1) (generated
by the blue triangles), because it keeps decaying with the fastest slope even after
the one at µ = 1.1 is settled to the slower slope. Consequently Z(µ = 0) would be
bigger than Z(µ = 1.1) even if the oscillation was not increasing with the chemical
potential, which means the dependence of the DOS from the chemical potential
alone favours the sign problem.

In our case, furthermore, the cos(κ(µ)N) oscillates faster and faster increasing

µ, which obviously results in even more severe cancellations.

5.3 The partition function from highly oscillating integral

107

5.3 The partition function from highly oscillating

integral

In this last section we are going to discuss how extract the value of the partition
function knowing ρ(N; µ). At ﬁrst sight, it would seem that (5.36) can be easily
computed just by using some algorithm that operates a Fourier transform (FT).
However this is, unfortunately, not the case because of the statistical noise imprinted
in the DOS. The argument for this can be formulated as follows.

We already know that our DOS is a fast decaying function, which is both in
L1(R) and L2(R), since its main contribution is gaussian. Let us assume that we
can consider ρ(N; µ) to be the sum of the ’true’ distribution plus noise. We know

(Plancherel theorem) that the Fourier transform bf , of an L1(R) ∩ L2(R) function
f , is again L2(R), i.e. bf is a fast decaying function in our frequency κ = sinh(µ).

On the other hand, the FT of the noise is again noise in κ, which will soon be
dominant over the fast decaying signal, and will completely spoil the computation
of the partition function. Unfortunately, this happens at relatively small values of
µ so that prevents the observation of interesting phenomena like the Silver Blaze.

A way out seems to be ﬁtting the a∗(N). The only requirement is that the
ﬁtting function has to be C∞. In fact, using a function which presents an arbitrary
discontinuity in the derivative would spoil the dependence of the partition function Z
from the chemical potential µ. More precisely, a discontinuity in the m-th derivative

of a function f (x), dominates the FT:f (x) = bf (k) ∼ k−m with a polynomial decay.

A good choice for the ﬁtting functions are the polynomials :

c2i+1N 2i+1,

(5.40)

a∗(N) =

d
dN

ln ρ(N; µ) ≃

mXi=0

where only odd powers are considered since we know that a∗(N) is odd in N. We can
see in Fig.5.4 that a polynomial of order seven p(x) = ax+ bx3 + cx5 + dx7, is already
good enough to ﬁt the data very well. In practise, we use the Bayesian evidence
for model comparison to determine the best polynomial ﬁt that avoids over-ﬁtting
[115, 116, 117].

Proceeding like this, we are able to shift the noise in the coeﬃcients c2i+1 in

such a way that it does not aﬀect the Fourier transform of

ρ(N; µ) = exp  mXi=0

c2i+1(µ)
2i + 2

N 2i+2! ,

(5.41)

which is, in fact, an L2(R) function. The noise appears in the result using some
error propagating method (like Bootstrap or Jackknife).

So, after the ﬁt, we are left with the partition function

would like to adopt and confront two diﬀerent methods :

• multi-precision numerical integration

• Lefschetz thimbles method.

The ﬁrst method is direct and consists in computing the FT in (5.42) numerically.
However, due to the cancellation in the integral, one has to be able to know the
value of the function at any given point with a precision at least of the same order
of magnitude of Z. The problem here is that not only the cancellations increase
with µ, but they become also exponentially more severe with the volume. The
classic argument for this is to look at the average phase factor

Figure 5.5: Contributing Lefschetz thimbles for order seven polynomial ﬁt of the

If the precision we need to computing the integral (5.42) numerically grows
exponentially with the volume of our lattice, it means that multi-precision will
eventually not be enough. To give an idea, already at volume 84 and µ = 1 the
precision required is more or less 50 digits.

This method, then, do not represent an eﬃcient solution to our problem per se,

but it will be very useful to be compared with the other two at small volumes.

5.3.1 Lefschetz thimble

Another very successful way to deal with oscillating integral is the Lefschetz thimbles
method. We already described it in detail in Cap.4, and here we will recall just the
very main steps.

After having performed the polynomial ﬁt and, therefore, having an explicit

form for (5.41), we can deﬁne the action-like function

S[N] = −

c2i+1(µ)
2i + 2

N 2i+2 + iκ(µ)N,

(5.45)

including in it the oscillating term. We proceed by complexify the variable N →
z = x + iy, and we look for the critical points of S[z], i.e. {zσ ∈ C : ∂zS[z]|z=zσ = 0}.
Starting from each one of those critical points zσ we can build a Lefschetz thimble
Jσ with equations

˙x = −Re (∂zS[z]) ,
˙y = +Im (∂zS[z]) ,

(5.46)

where t is the parametrization of the thimbles. In this case, they are one-dimensional
trajectories in the complex plane, along which the imaginary part of the action
ImS[z] is constant. In the end, we are able to write the partition function as the
sum of integrals over the thimbles

union of all contributing thimbles forms a deformation of the original real axis. In
Fig.5.5 we show a typical example of new domain of integration composed by the
contributing Lefschetz thimbles in the complex plane.

Along this new contour we are left with a global phase e−iImS[zσ], which is usu-
ally harmless even though it is diﬀerent on each thimble and, therefore, has to be
carefully taken into account. Together with the global phase, there is a residual sign
problem coming from the Jacobian ∂z
∂t . The latter, in general, is much milder than
the original sign problem and is seldom a problem and also in our case it does not
create any problem to the numerical integration along the thimbles.

The results obtained with multi-precision and with Lefschetz thimble agree with
each other. In Fig.5.6 we show the average free energy density diﬀerence between
full and phase quenched theory h∆fi = − T
, for the 84 lattice. We confront
our results (red triangles) with the analytical computation (black line) of mean ﬁeld
complex Langevin dynamics [112], which the author shared with us. We notice a
small discrepancy starting from µ = 1. An explanation for that could be a systematic
error introduced by the ﬁt in our method or an inaccuracy of the mean ﬁeld theory
at high µ or both together. Along this line of thoughts, an interesting observation

is that if we ﬁt the data only up until the change in slope (as in Fig.5.7 up) with a
cubic polynomial a(N) = c1N + c3N 3, then we get values of h∆Fi compatible with
the mean ﬁeld expected value (Fig.5.7 down).
We would, also, like to stress that the typical value of the partition function for
the last values of µ is of the order of the 10−30−10−40. That means the LLR method
for computing the DOS is able to achieve a remarkable precision.

In conclusion, in this Chapter we described the density of states method, based
on the LLR algorithm, as a candidate for the study of theories aﬀected by the
sign problem. We showed how this allows to reduce a complicated four-dimensional

112

Density of States

theory in a one dimensional integral. The oscillating integral, though, is still very
problematic even in one dimension, and forces us to implement a ﬁt of the a∗(N) to
get rid of the noise. This inevitably introduces a systematic error which we try to
control with, for example, Bayesian methods.

Lastly we showed some results for the average of the logarithm of the phase.
We found good agreement with a mean ﬁeld calculation up to µ = 1 where the two
methods give slightly diﬀerent results.

We also found that the DOS method is capable of extremely precise direct
measurements as, for example, partition functions of the order of 10−40 or smaller.

Conclusions

The topic of this thesis is centred on the sign problem in lattice ﬁeld theory. In
particular, our eﬀorts have been concentrated on three diﬀerent approaches, namely
complex Langevin dynamics, Lefschetz thimble and density of states, and their
application to various theories and toy models aﬀected by the sign problem.

Particular focus has been put on complex Langevin dynamics. We dedicate
Cap.2 to review stochastic quantization as an alternative to the usual path integral
formulation of the QFT, and to discuss the formal proofs of correctness for complex
Langevin dynamics. We also introduced the concept of gauge cooling as a method
to control CL dynamics into the complexiﬁed space. We employed gauge cooling in
the one dimensional Polyakov chain model, where the sign problem is triggered by
a complex β in the action. We showed that, indeed, gauge cooling is able to control
the dynamics in the complex directions leading CL to converge to the right results
even where, without gauge cooling, it would have failed.

After that, we moved on to applying complex Langevin dynamics to the Yang-
Mills pure gauge theory with a topological θ-term. This probably represents the
most challenging chapter (Cap.3) of the thesis. We showed that the use of CL
dynamics, helped by the gauge cooling technique, allows us to obtain results at real
θ, at least for the bare (unrenormalised) theory. We put particular care in testing
the criteria of correctness to ensure the results at real θ are reliable. We produced, at
real θ, the behaviour of the bare topological charge Qbare(θ), expected by analytical
continuation from imaginary θ where the action is real and Monte Carlo methods
can be employed. Lastly, we used this information to study the dependence of the
bare topological susceptibility χtop from θ.

Another very interesting method developed in order to deal with the sign prob-
lem is the one based on the Lefschetz thimbles. The starting point of this method,
as well as complex Langevin dynamics, is the complexiﬁcation of the ﬁelds in the
theory. Moreover, the equations of the thimbles are the complex conjugate of the
classical, i.e. without noise, CL equations. A comparison which enhances the sim-
ilarity and the diﬀerences between those two approaches is, therefore, very inter-
esting.
In Cap.4, we compare CL dynamics and Lefschetz thimble in the study
of a quartic model, U(1) one-link model with a complex determinant, and SU(2)
non abelian one-link model with an imaginary β parameter in the action. Here
we showed the quartic model mostly as an introduction on the Lefschetz thimbles
method. The second model is interesting because the determinant can be included

as a non-holomorphic term in the action, in analogy with what happens in QCD
at ﬁnite density. The third model presents similarities with gauge theories in real
time dynamics, i.e.
imaginary β. From the CL point of view, it can be tested
both with complete gauge ﬁxing and gauge cooling. Furthermore, the gauge ﬁxed
representation produces the Haar measure, which also can be included as a non holo-
morphic term in the action. This study led us to observe directly the connection
between CL and Lefschetz thimbles and, furthermore, we could establish the role of
the singularities in the thimbles approach, i.e. they are always the end point of a
thimble.

The last approach to the sign problem we have dealt with is the density of
states. We reviewed how, in this method, one numerically computes the canonical
density of states relative to the action, simplifying the quantum ﬁeld theory to a one
dimensional problem. We showed that, when the action is complex, one can regard
the imaginary part of the action Im(S) = N as the grand-canonical variable. It is
possible, then, to build a positive generalized density of states ρ(N) by using only
the real part of the action Re(S). In the end, we are left with a one dimensional
oscillating integral in N. We applied the generalized DOS method to the relativistic
Bose gas theory at ﬁnite density. We considered two diﬀerent ansatz for the ﬁt of
the DOS and, in both cases, we showed our computation of free energy density as a
function of the chemical potential µ.

In this thesis we described in detail three approaches to the sign problem. Of
those three, Lefschetz thimbles and density of states method are somehow more re-
cent and still in a testing phase. Which means promising results have been achieved
in several toy models and simple ﬁeld theories, like the Bose gas at ﬁnite density,
but the step to full gauge theories and QCD has yet to be done. Complex Langevin
dynamics, on the other hand, has already completed the testing part, developing
formal criteria of correctness which guides the trustworthy of its results. Further-
more, its application to gauge theories with a sign problem has already started in
the last couple of years, obtaining promising results even for full QCD. The most
recent eﬀorts are mainly aimed to deal with non holomorphic drifts and to achieve
full control of CL dynamics in the whole space of the parameter, using gauge cool-
ing or some alternative method. The successful completion of both this challenges
would elect CL dynamics as the ﬁrst consistent method to quantitatively study the
phase diagram of any gauge theory aﬀected by the sign problem, in particular QCD
at ﬁnite density.
