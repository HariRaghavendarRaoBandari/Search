Abstract

We generalize the diﬀerential representation of the operators of the Galilean alge-
bras to include fractional derivatives. As a result a whole new class of scale invariant
Galilean algebras are obtained. The ﬁrst member of this class has dynamical index
z = 2 similar to the Schr¨odinger algebra. The second member of the class has dy-
namical index z = 3/2, which happens to be the dynamical index Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
equation.

Introduction

Locality has been the guiding principal of many branches of physics. This has come about in
opposition to the concept of action at a distance. That is to say for something to inﬂuence
another thing an entity such as a ﬁeld or particle must travel between the two points. How-
ever phenomena such as the EPR experiments point to the plausibility of non-local theories
in quantum mechanics [1]. Another setting in which non-local theories arise is equilibrium
thermodynamics, where systems have had enough time to reach a state of equilibrium where
long range correlations have come into existence. An example of recent work in this di-
rection is given by [2], where conformal invariance of long range Ising model is discussed.
This means that non-local theories may be acceptable. If locality is given up a very rich
arena of possible models in theoretical physics arises, one of which is the option of having
fractional derivatives. Consequently this opens up the ﬁeld for seeking symmetry algebras
which are composed of derivatives with fractional order. In this paper we are going to see
what we can get if Galilean symmetry is augmented with fractional derivative operators. We
ﬁnd a whole new class of scale and Galilean invariant symmetries, with previously unknown
dynamic exponents. Galilean symmetries have received some attention recently due to their
appearance in the AdS/CFT correspondence [3]- [11]. The Galilean symmetries are com-
posed of translations in time and space plus rotations in space and boosts to inertial frames
that move with constant velocity. One can add to this set, scale transformations and boosts
to frames of reference which conserve higher derivatives such as accelerations plus toroidal
transformations of the time component. These symmetries lead to L-Galilei algebras [12,13]
where L is an integer, for related works see [14]- [16]. The disappointment in L-Galilean
symmetries is that not all dynamical exponents z arise, although the ﬁrst two members of
this class i.e. Galilean Conformal Algebra (GCA) z = 1 [17]- [20] and Schrodinger symmetry
z = 2, [21]- [26] are well known. Attempts to obtain other dynamical exponents exist [27]
where the dynamical index of z = 3
2 was obtained. However this remained a singular case.
Other cases exists [28, 29] in which further values of dynamical index are obtained using the
age subalgebra of the Schr¨odinger algebra. However the algebra only closes on the solution
space.

In this paper we show that admitting fractional derivatives allows a new class of Galilean
symmetries, which we call F-Galilean where F is an integer and the dynamical exponent is
given by

Z =

F + 1

F

(1.1)

Thus for F = 1, we have the well-know exponent z = 2 (This symmetry is smaller than
Schrodinger symmetry) and for F = 2 we get z = 3
the well-known exponent of
the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation [30]. The price we paid for this extension is non-
locality through introduction of fractional derivatives. This paper is organized as follows,
in section 2 we give a brief introduction to L-Galilei algebras, which in fact encompasses all
known galilean algebras. In Section 3 we introduce fractional derivatives and some of their
properties. In section 4 we derive the new class of galilean algebras which posses diﬀerential
operator representations including fractional derivatives. It is in fact through the consistency
of these representations that we derive this new class of non-local galilean symmetries.

2 L-Galilei Algebra

L-Galilei algebra were introduced independently by Henkel [12] and Negro, del Olmo and
Rodr´ıguez-Marco [13]. Here we brieﬂy review their method. First, let us recall the two
well-known non-relativistic symmetries: Schr¨odinger and conformal Galilean algebras.

-Schr¨odinger Algebra

Schr¨odinger algebra consists of the following generators. The center is formed by the

generators of the Galilean transformations

P = −∂x,

H = −∂t,

B = −t∂x

(2.1)

which guarantees invariance under translations in space and time, plus Galilean boost.

Besides the Galilean generators, the Schr¨odinger algebra has three more generators. Two

of them are, the dilation generator:

D = −(t∂t +

1
2

x∂x),

along with the special Schrodinger generator

C = −(t2∂t + tx∂x).

(2.2)

(2.3)

The last generator is the mass operator which is the outcome of commutators of B and P

[B, P ] = M0.

(2.4)

The interesting point with Schr¨odinger algebra is that it has an SL(2, R) subalgebra: H, D
and C. Commutators read as

[D, C] = −C

[D, H] = H

[C, H] = 2D.

(2.5)

In this subalgebra H produces translation in time and D produces scale transformations:

x → λx,

t → λ2t.

(2.6)

Together with C, the subalgebra guarantees global conformal transformation in temporal
direction

t → αt + β
γt + δ

αδ − βγ = 1

along with its spatial counterpart

x → x

(γt + δ)

.

2

(2.7)

(2.8)

Adding Galilean boost to these elements we end up with the following transformation in
space and time

t → αt + β
γt + δ

x → x + c1t + c0

γt + δ

-Conformal Galilean Algebra

where

αδ − βγ = 1

(2.9)

The other well-known non-relativistic algebra; the Conformal Galilean Algebra (CGA)
[17]; similar to the Schr¨odinger algebra consists of six generators. Similar to the Schr¨odinger
algebra, CGA contains a SL(2, R) subalgebra
D = −t∂t − x∂x

C = −t2∂t − tx∂x

H = −∂t,

(2.10)

Unlike the Schr¨odinger algebra, CGA, dilation generator scales space and time isotropically

x → λx,

t → λt.

(2.11)

- L-Galilei Algebra

As it was seen, both Schrodinger algebra and CGA contain a SL(2, R) subalgebra which
guarantees global transformation in temporal direction. In other words we have translation
in time H = ∂t. As well we have scaling in space and time D = −(t∂t + 1
z x∂x) which generally
produces an anisotropic dilation in space and time

x → λx,

t → λzt.

(2.12)

To close SL(2, R) subalgebra we have no choice other than to deﬁne C and it reads as

C = −(t2∂t +

2
z

tx∂x).

(2.13)

To build L-Galilei algebra we start with this SL(2, R) subalgebra we add two generators of
transformation in space P = −∂x and the Galilean boost B = −t∂x. Now, we observe that
the action of D counts the scaling weights of all generators

[D, P ] =

1
z

P

[D, B] = (

− 1)B.

1
z

On the other hand C raises scaling weights of the generators.

[C, P ] = (

− 1)B

2
z

[C, B] = (

− 1)tB.

2
z

(2.14)

(2.15)

Note that the action of C has produced a new operator tB which has a higher weight than B.
So, we deﬁne the new generators Pq = −tq∂x, such that for q = 0 it represents momentum
and for q = 1 it represents boost. Now, C raises the value of q and we can simply write

[C, Pq] = (

− q)Pq+1

2
z

3

(2.16)

If we desire the algebra to close for some ﬁnite value L then we set 2/z − L = 0. So the
algebra closes if z = 2
L where L is an integer. Gathering all commutation relations we have

[D, H] = H,
[H, Pq] = −qPq−1
[C, Pq] = (2l − q)Pq+1

[D, C] = −C,
[D, Pq] = (l − q)Pq,

[C, H] = 2D,

The obtained L-algebra is the inﬁnitesimal form of the following transformations

(cid:126)x → x + t2l(cid:126)c2l + ... + t(cid:126)c1 + (cid:126)c0

(γt + δ)2l

t → αt + β
γt + δ

(2.17)

(2.18)

where (cid:126)cn ∈ Rn.

The smallest element of the class is given by L = 1 which is the Schr¨odinger algebra,
widely studied in the literature. The second element is given by L = 2 and is nothing but
CGA.

Note that although the SL(2, R) generators exist in both CGA and Schrodinger algebra
their presence is not crucial to non-relativistic algebras. In the aging problem for instance,
time translation invariance is not satisﬁed, see [31]- [33]. For a much more comprehen-
sive study see [27]. With this motivation in mind we note that by extending to fractional
derivatives the algebra obtained in this section can be generalized.

3 Fractional Derivatives

The idea is to extend the concept of derivative Dn = ( d
dx)nto non-integer values Da for all
values of a. Our motivation behind this extension is that new symmetry groups can arise
which cannot exist for integer values of a.
It is expected that the local property of the
diﬀerential operator will be lost when a is no longer an integer. An obvious application is
oﬀered by the Brownian motion. Whilst the normal Brownian motion with an index α = 1
is related to the diﬀusion equation,

< ∆x2 > ∼ tα

(3.1)

the sub (super) ordinate Brownian motion is described by non-integer α < 1 (α > 1)
anomalous diﬀusion equation [34]

The straight forward deﬁnition of the fractional derivative acting on powers is given by

∂ψ
∂t

= ∆

1

α ψ

(3.2)

Daxb =

Γ(b + 1)

Γ(b − a + 1)

xb−a

As a byproduct we have the familiar derivative rule, which will be used below

DDaxb =

Γ(b + 1)
Γ(b − a)

xb−a−1

4

(3.3)

(3.4)

it is also easy to see that the usual properties of the derivatives such as associativity and
Leibniz rule holds. For instance

DaDb = Da+b

(3.5)

A direct consequence of above is the following commutation relation which we need in our
calculations

[Dα, x] = αDα−1

(3.6)

There are many deﬁnitions for fractional derivatives in terms of integrals. A more frequently
used deﬁnition is Caputo derivative [35]

4 Fractional Galilei Algebras

The aim is to ﬁnd a symmetry which respects Galilean transformations as well as scale
invariance. We start with Dilation and translation generators

D = −(t∂t +

1
z

x∂x),

H = −∂t,

P = −∂x

which satisﬁes the commutation relations

[D, H] = H,

[D, P ] =

1
z

P,

[H, P ] = 0.

Following [27] we deﬁne the boost generator as

B = −t∂x − M(∂x)x

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

To go further we better write generators in a way that their weight is represented. So, we
write

X0 = D

X−1 = H

Y+ = B

Y− = P,

(4.4)

Now the scaling weights of generators is indicated and for the commutation relations we
simply have

For Y+ we then expect

[X0, X−1] = X−1

[X0, Y−] =

1
z

Y−.

[X0, Y+] = −z − 1

z

Y+.

Plugging in their diﬀerential forms we obtain

(4.7)

which results in

The solution is

(z − 2)M(∂x) = −M(cid:48)(∂x)∂x.

M(∂x) = M0∂2−z

x

,

in which M0 is a constant number. So, the ﬁnal form of Y+ is:

Y+ = −t∂x − M0∂2−z
x x

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

Now, we go through the commutators and seek the value of z for which the algebra closes.
Start with

and observe that

[X−1, Y−] = 0,

[X−1, Y+] = Y−.

[Y+, Y−] = −M0∂2−z

x

(4.11)

(4.12)

We call this new operator Q1. Let’s investigate the commutation relation of Q1 with other
operators

[X0, Q1] =
Q1
[Y+, Q1] = (2 − z)M 2
Now we deﬁne the sequence of generators

0 ∂3−2z

x

2 − z
z

[X−1, Q1] = 0

[Y−, Q1] = 0.

Qi = −M i

0[Πi

Commutators of existing generators with Qi read as

(4.13)

(4.15)

i + 1 − iz

z

[X0, Qi] =

Qi

[X−1, Qi] = 0

[Qi, Qj] = 0

[Y+, Qi] = Qi+1

[Y−, Qi] = 0.

The scaling weight of Qi is i+1−iz
and Y+ acts as ladder operator. Now, suppose that given
the value of z, there is a number F such that the scaling weight of QF is zero. This causes
the algebra to close since the ladder operator does not generate a new generator. This leads
to the value

z

z =

F + 1

F

.

(4.16)

If we look at deﬁnition of Qi then we see that for such values of F and z QF is a number
and then the algebra will be closed. Summing up for any value of F we have an algebra as
follows

[X−1, Y+] = Y−

[X−, Y−] = 0

(4.18)

[Y+, Y−] = Q1
[Qi, Qj] = 0

[Y+, Qi] = Qi+1

This is a novel class of algebras with fractional derivatives which we call F-Galilei algebra.
Similar to L-Galilei algebra given any positive integer value for F we a have a new algebra.
Interestingly similar to the L-Galilei algebra the ﬁrst element of the class has dynamical
(F = 1) but diﬀers from the Schr¨odinger algebra by X 1. The second element
index z = 2
of F-Galilei class has dynamical index z = 3
2. This is the algebra obtained by Henkel in [27].
The only task left is to check the Jacobi identity. First let us draw the weights diagram
as in Fig. 1. It can be easily concluded that amongst all possible triplets, we only need to
check the following triplets: {X0, X−1, Y+}, {X0, Y+, Qi}, and {Y+, Qi, Qj}, resulting in:

[[X0, X−], Y+] + [[X−1, Y+], X0] + [[Y+, X0], X−1] = [X−1, Y+]+

[Y−, X0] + [

Y− − 1
[[X0, Y+], Qi] + [[Y+, QI], X0] + [[Qi, X0], Y+] = [− 1

Y+, X−1] = Y− − F

Qi+1 = 0,

[[Y+, Qi], Qj] + [[Qi, Qj], Y+] + [[Qj + Y+], Qi] = [Qi+1, Qj] + [0, Y+] − [Qj+1, Qi] = 0

We therefore observe that the Jacobi identity is satisﬁed. Furthermore It can be deduced
from the weights diagram that QF commutes with all the elements of the algebra, i.e. it is
the central charge.

5 Conclusions

We have observed that admitting fractional derivatives greatly enlarges the kind of sym-
metries we can have. In this paper we added fractional derivative generators to the scale,
space and time invariance, results in a class of algebras with an inﬁnite number of ele-
ments. The ﬁrst element of this class is a sub-algebra of the Schr¨odinger algebra where only
X 1 = −t2∂t − 2tx∂x is left out. This means that the algebra has scale invariance within it
but not conformal invariance. Note that for F = 1 we do not have fractional derivatives.

The second member of the class is an algebra which is has dynamical index z = 3/2
and previously was found in [27] . We have not yet succeeded to ﬁnd candidate actions left
invariant by this algebras, which we hope to do in future. However it is more than likely
that these will be non-local actions.
