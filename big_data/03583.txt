On the group algebra decomposition of a Jacobian
variety

Received: date / Accepted: date

Abstract Given a compact Riemann surface X with an action of a ﬁnite
group G, the group algebra Q[G] provides an isogenous decomposition of its
Jacobian variety JX, known as the group algebra decomposition of JX. We
obtain a method to concretely build a decomposition of this kind. Our method
allows us to study the geometry of the decomposition. For instance, we build
several decompositions in order to determine which one has kernel of smallest
order. We apply this method to families of trigonal curves up to genus 10.

1 Introduction

The action of a ﬁnite group on a given compact Riemann surface X of genus
g ≥ 2 induces a homomorphism ρ : Q[G] → EndQ(JX) from the rational
group algebra Q[G] into the rational endomorphism algebra of JX in a nat-
ural way. The factorization of Q[G] into a product of simple algebras yields a
decomposition of JX into abelian subvarieties [18], [15], up to isogeny.

This decomposition, and in general Jacobians with group action, have been
extensively studied from diﬀerent points of view [10], [18], [16], [22], [23], [17],
[3], [8], [25], [29], [15], [1].

In [23] the decomposition of Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves in elliptic
factors is studied. The author developed a nice geometrical description for
these Jacobians up to genus 10. Her motivation came from [10] where they
asked for completely decomposable Jacobians of any dimension g (They gave
examples up to g = 1297). In [29] an explicit formula to calculate the dimension
of the factors in the decomposition of JX is given and the polarizations of
the subvarieties in the decomposition of JX are studied in [16] and [17]. In
general, the kernel of the decomposition of JX has not been studied. The
only references treating kernels we know are: [27] for Jacobians with action
of the symmetric group of order 3, [21] where the author studies families of
curves whose Jacobians are isomorphic to a product of elliptic curves and [7]
where the authors study dihedral actions on Jacobians, but the tools used to
compute kernels are diﬀerent from the method developed here.

In this work, we present a method to concretely build an isogeny which is
a group algebra decomposition (Section 4). We do this deepening the method
developed in [16]. This allows us to describe the lattices of the factors in a group
algebra decomposition. Moreover, we ﬁnd a method to determine the order of
the kernel of this isogeny. We give a speciﬁc criterion to choose the subvarieties
in a group algebra decomposition having a kernel of smallest possible order.
In particular, we can decide when the isogeny is an isomorphism.

We apply our method to non-normal trigonal curves (see [32]) and normal
trigonal curves of genus g < 10 with reduced group A4, S4 and A5. In these
cases, we determine the factors of the decomposition such that the size of the
kernel is the minimum possible (Section 5). The description of the lattices of
the factors in the decomposition of JX provides an alternative explanation of
the subspace of the loci of Jacobians of trigonal curves inside the moduli space
Ag of principally polarized abelian varieties by means of the Riemann matrix
of the decomposition (Remark 6).

2 Preliminaries

Let G be a ﬁnite group. The known results about the representations of G
used in this section may be founded in [30] and [9].

If V is an irreducible representation of G over C, we denote F as its ﬁeld
of deﬁnition and K the ﬁeld obtained by extending Q by the values of the
character χV ; then K ⊆ F and mV = [F : K] is the Schur index of V .

If H is a subgroup of G, Ind1G

will denote the representation of G induced
by the trivial representation of H and hU, V i denotes the usual inner product of
, V i = dimCV H ,
the characters. By the Frobenius Reciprocity Theorem hInd1G
where V H is the subspace of V ﬁxed by H.

Any compact Riemann surface X of genus g has an associated principally
polarized abelian variety JX (i.e. a complex tori with a principal polarization).
This variety is called the Jacobian variety of X and has complex dimension g.
Good accounts of abelian varieties and Jacobians are given in [4] and [28].

On the group algebra decomposition of JX

Given a compact Riemann surface X with an action of a group G, we
consider the induced homomorphism ρ : Q[G] → EndQ(JX). For any element
α ∈ Q[G] we deﬁne an abelian subvariety

Bα := Im(α) = ρ(lα)(JX) ⊂ JX,

(1)

where l is some positive integer such that lα ∈ Z[G].

As Q[G] decomposes into a product Q0 ×· · ·×Qr of simple Q−algebras, the
simple algebras Qi are in bijective correspondence with the rational irreducible
representations of G. That is, for any rational irreducible representation Wi of
G there is a uniquely determined central idempotent ei. This idempotent de-
ﬁnes an abelian subvariety, namely Bi = Bei . These varieties, called isotypical
components, are uniquely determined by the representation Wi.

The addition map is an isogeny [18, section 2].

µ : B0 × · · · × Br → JX,

(2)

which is called the isotypical decomposition of JX.

Moreover, the decomposition of every Qi = L1 × · · · × Lni into a product
of minimal left ideals (all isomorphic) gives a further decomposition of the Ja-
cobian. There are idempotents fi1, . . . , fini ∈ Qi such that ei = fi1 + · · · + fini
where ni = dimVi/mVi, with Vi the C−irreducible representation associated
to Wi. These idempotents provide subvarieties Bij := Bfij of JX.

It is known that the factor in the isotypical decomposition of JX associated
to the trivial representation of G is isogenous to JG = J(X/G). This factor
will be denoted by B0. Then the addition map is an isogeny

ν : JG × Π n1

1 B1j × · · · × Π nr

1 Brj → JX.

(3)

This is called the group algebra decomposition of JX [17]. We use this
name to refer to the isogeny ν as well. Note that since all the minimal left
ideals decomposing Qi are isomorphic, which implies that the sub-varieties
deﬁned by the idempotents fij are isogenous, we may write the group algebra
decomposition as

˜ν : JG × Bn1

11 × · · · × Bnr

r1 → JX,

(4)

which is the classical way of writing it. The problem with this is that one of
our goals is to minimize the order of the kernel of ν, and there are exam-
ples (for instance [11]) where we may even obtain isomorphisms by changing
the components in the same isogeny class. Therefore, we will stay with the
decomposition (3) because it will allow us to reduce the kernel of the isogeny.

If two complex tori B and B′ are isogenous, we write B ∼ B′.
For group actions on a Riemann surface we follow the notation and def-
initions given in [12]. We deﬁne the group of automorphisms Aut(X) of a
Riemann surface X as the analytical automorphism group of X. We say that
a ﬁnite group G acts on X if G ≤ Aut(X). The quotient X/G (the space of the
orbits of the action of G on X) is a compact Riemann surface with complex

atlas given by the holomorphic branched covering πG : X → X/G. The degree
of πG is |G| and the multiplicity of πG at p is multp(πG) = |Gp| for all p ∈ X,
where Gp denotes the stabilizer of p in G. If |Gp| 6= 1 then p will be a branch
point of πG.

Let {p1, ..., pr} ⊂ X be a maximal collection of non-equivalent branch
points with respect to G. We will denote γ = g(X/G). We deﬁne the the sig-
nature (or branching data) of G on X as the vector of numbers (γ; m1, ..., mr)
where mi = |Gpi |. We have the Riemann-Hurwitz formula g(X) = |G|(γ −
1) + 1 + |G|

i=1(cid:0)1 − 1

mi(cid:1), where g(X) denotes the genus of X.

A 2γ + r tuple (a1, . . . , aγ, b1, . . . , bγ, c1, . . . , cr) of elements of G is called

2 Pr

a generating vector of type (γ; m1, ..., mr) if the following are satisﬁed:
i) G is generated by the elements (a1, . . . , aγ, b1, . . . , bγ, c1, . . . , cr);
ii) order(ci) = mi; and

iii) Qγ

i=1[ai, bi]Qr

j=1 cj = 1, where [ai, bi] is the commutator of ai, bi ∈ G.
The existence of a generating vector of given type ensures the existence
of a Riemann surface with an action of a given ﬁnite group. The dimension
of the subvarieties in the decomposition (3) are obtained using the generating
vector of the action [29, Theorem 5.12].

Moreover, the induced action of G on JX = Cn/H1(X, Z) provides geomet-
rical information about the components of the group algebra decomposition
of JX [8].

Deﬁnition 1 For any subgroup H of G, deﬁne pH = 1
central idempotent in Q[H] corresponding to the trivial representation of H.
Also, we deﬁne f i

|H| Ph∈H h as the

H as pHei, an idempotent element in Q[G]ei.

Then the corresponding group algebra decomposition of JH = J(X/H) is

given as follows [8, Proposition 5.2]:

3 Describing the factors via a symplectic representation

We are interested in describing the factors of the group algebra decomposition
of a Jacobian variety with group action given in the previous section.

The method we follow is to describe the lattice of such factors. We apply

[16, Section 2], but extended to any symmetric idempotent α = Pg∈G agg.

Let Λ = H1(X, Z) denote the lattice of JX and ΛQ = Λ ⊗Z Q. Let ρs :
Q[G] → End(ΛQ) denote the morphism induced by the (symplectic) rational

representation of G in Λ, ρ : Q[G] → EndQ JX is the homomorphism given
by the action of the group G on X and ρr is the rational representation of
EndQ(JX) which completes the diagram below.

Thus ρr induces a rational representation of HomQ(Πij Bij, JX) given by
ν → νΛ : ⊕ijΛij → Λ, where νΛ is the restriction of ν to the lattice ⊕ijΛij of
the product of the Bij in ν.

Then ρs(α) ∈ End ΛQ is given by ρs(α) = Pg∈G agρs(g).

Therefore we have the following facts, analogous to [16, section 2].

Proposition 1 Let α ∈ Q[G]. The sublattice of Λ deﬁning Bα = Vα/Λα is
given by

Λα := ρs(α)(ΛQ) ∩ Λ,

where the intersection is taken in ΛQ and ρs(α) is the image of α by ρs. In
this case, the C−vector space Vα is generated by ρs(α)(ΛQ).

The previous construction is clearer in its matrix form, once bases are
chosen. From here to the end of this work, we use this form for determining
the lattice of the factors in ν.

Remark 1 Suppose we have Γ = {α1, . . . , α2g} a (symplectic) basis of the
lattice Λ of the Jacobian JX (assumed to be of dimension g). Consider ρs in
its matrix form (with respect to this basis).

For any g ∈ G, we have that ρs(g) is a square matrix of size 2g. Hence, for

any α ∈ Q[G], we have associated to it a rational 2g × 2g-matrix

M = (mij).

The j-th column of M corresponds to the element ρs(g)(αj) = P2g

and the lattice Λα of Bα corresponds to

i=1 mijαi

Λα := (hM iZ ⊗ Q) ∩ Λ,

6

Leslie Jim´enez

where hM iZ denotes the lattice over Z generated by the columns of M .

In other words, the lattice Λα is obtained by considering the R-linearly
independent columns of M and intersecting it with Λ. Our next step is to look
for a basis of Λα, which will be in terms of the elements of Γ . By computing
its coordinates in the basis Γ , we get a 2g × 2 dim Bα coordinate matrix of the
lattice Λα. Moreover, Vα is the complex vector space generated by the column
vectors of M .

4 Method. A group algebra decomposition ν×

In this section we develop the core of this work. We present a method to
concretely build an isogeny ν as in (3).

Given a compact Riemann surface X with the action of a group G, the
general theory gives us the existence of a group algebra decomposition for the
corresponding Jacobian variety JX. The results in [29] allow us to compute
the dimensions of the factors. Nevertheless to describe further geometrical
properties such as induced polarization, period matrix, etc., we need an explicit
description of the factors. Section 3 gives us a tool to solve some of these
questions, under certain hypotheses for G.

We present here a method to ﬁnd a set of primitive idempotents fi1, . . . , fini
to describe the factors in this decomposition, in order to extract properties of
the decomposition. This concrete construction will allow us to easily compute
the order of the kernel of the isogeny ν. Hence we may choose an optimal set
of those idempotents in the sense of getting the smallest possible kernel.

We consider the quotient of X for the action of G of genus 0 for sim-
plicity, because it is known that the factor in ν corresponding to the trivial
representation is the image of pG, hence it is isogenous to JG.

Data: Let X be a Riemann surface of genus g ≥ 2 with the action of a group
G with total quotient of genus 0. Assume that the symplectic representation
ρs for this action is known.

1. STEP ONE: Identiﬁcation of factors using Jacobians of intermediate

coverings.

The following lemma gives us conditions under which a factor in the group
algebra decomposition can be described as the image of a concrete idempotent,
in particular when it corresponds to a Jacobian of an intermediate quotient.

Lemma 1 Let X be a Riemann surface with an action of a ﬁnite group G
such that the genus of XG is equal to zero. Consider ν, the group algebra
decomposition of JX as in (3).
(i) If H ≤ G is such that dimC V H

i = mi, where mi is the Schur index of the

representation Vi, then for some j ∈ {1, ..., ni} we have that

Im(f i

H ) = Bij .

In addition,
(ii) if dimC V H

l = 0 for all l, l 6= i, such that dimC Bl 6= 0 in the isotypical

decomposition of JX in Equation (2), then

JH ∼ Im(pH ) = Bij.

Proof From Proposition 1 and the fact that dimC V H
Π ki
Im(f i

H ) =
i = mi (by hypothesis), we obtain that ki = 1. Hence

i Bij. Since dimC V H

6= 0, we get Im(f i

i

H ) := Bij for some j ∈ {1, ..., ni}.
If, in addition, dimC V H

l = 0 (equivalently dimQ W H

6= 0, then f l
H we obtain that pH = f i

l = 0) for all l 6= i
H = 0 for all of them. Due to the fact that
H. Moreover, by equation (5) we

such that dimC Bl

pH = Pl∈{1,...,r} f l

have JH ∼ Im(pH ) = Bij .

Remark 2 Observe that if H satisﬁes Lemma 1 for some i ∈ {1, ..., r}, then all
its conjugates satisfy it for the same i. To see this, consider H ′ = H g = gHg−1.
It is clear that for all s ∈ G, we have

dimC V H

i = hInd1G

.

Our purpose is to use this result conversely to actually produce an isogeny

ν.

STEP TWO: Deﬁnition of certain subvarieties of JX.

Deﬁnition 2 Let H be a subgroup of G satisfying condition (i) of Lemma 1
for some i ∈ {1, ..., r}, then deﬁne BH as the image of fH = pH ei.

Note that depending on the geometry of the action, BH can be trivial.
From Proposition 1, we get that its lattice corresponds to

ΛH := (hρs(fH )iZ ⊗ Q) ∩ H1(X, Z).

(8)

Using the procedure described in Remark 1, we obtain the coordinate ma-
trix corresponding to a basis of the lattice of BH . We sometimes use the same
symbol ΛH to denote this matrix.

8

Leslie Jim´enez

Corollary 1 Let H be a subgroup of G satisfying both conditions of Lemma
1. Then fH = pH ei = pH , and BH is isogenous to the Jacobian of X/H.

Proof By Lemma 1, if H satisﬁes both conditions then the Jacobian of X/H
is isogenous to one of the factors in a group algebra decomposition for JX.
This is equivalent to the equality of their corresponding idempotents.

3. STEP THREE: Construction of a product subvariety B× of JX.

If we have enough subgroups from STEP TWO, we may construct the
product of all the subvarieties deﬁned by those subgroups. This will be a
subvariety of JX, its lattice is described in the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3 Let r + 1 be the number of rational irreducible representations
of G. Suppose for all i ∈ {1, . . . , r} and all j = {1, . . . , ni} there is a subgroup
Hij satisfying condition (i) of Lemma 1. For each i, j take one Hij, and let

S = {Hij : i ∈ {1, . . . , r}, j ∈ {1, . . . , ni}}

be the set of these subgroups, where we do not consider subgroups Hij such
that Im(fHij ) = 0. We deﬁne LS ∈ M2g(Z) to be the coordinate matrix given
by the vertical join of the coordinate matrices of the lattices ΛHij (see equation
8) for Hij ∈ S.

We recall here that i = 0 corresponds to the trivial representation whose
factor is not considered here, ni = dim Vi/mi, where mi is the Schur index of
a complex irreducible representation Vi associated to the rational irreducible
representation corresponding to the factor Bni

ij (from (3)).

The lattice Λ× deﬁned by the matrix LS, corresponds to the sublattice

⊕ijΛHij of Λ = H1(X, Z). It is the lattice of the following subvariety of JX

where BHij is as in Deﬁnition 2.

B× := Πi,jBHij ,

Deﬁnition 4 With the above notation deﬁne a sum map ν× : B× → JX

ν×(b11, . . . , brnr) = Xi,j

bij ∈ JX.

STEP FOUR: Condition for ν× to be an isogeny.

Deﬁnition 5 Let S = {Hij : i = 1..r, j = 1..ni} be a set of subgroups of G
as in Deﬁnition 3. We say that S is an eﬀective set for G if the determinant
of the corresponding matrix LS is diﬀerent from 0.

On the group algebra decomposition of JX

Theorem 1 Let X be a Riemann surface of genus g ≥ 2 with an action of a
group G with total quotient of genus 0. Let S = {Hij}ij be an eﬀective set for
G, then the map ν× deﬁnition 4 is an isogeny with kernel of order | det(LS)|.

Proof As before, denote by Λ the lattice of JX. The map ν× induces a ho-
momorphism of Z−modules νΛ : Λ× → Λ. If the rank of Λ× is 2g, then νΛ is
a monomorphism of lattices in Cg. Moreover, all the sublattices ΛHij decom-
posing Λ× correspond to subvarieties BHij . Therefore the dimension of B× is
g.

It remains to show either ν× is surjective or its kernel is of ﬁnite order. For
any isogeny f : A1 → A2 between two abelian varieties, it is known [4, section
1.2] that

|Ker(f )| = det ρr(f ),

(9)

where ρr(f ) is the rational representation of the isogeny f . It is known that
if the kernel is ﬁnite, then its cardinality equals the index [Λ : Λ×]. As the
matrix LS is non singular, we have that Λ× is a lattice in Cg, hence this
index is ﬁnite. After columns operations, the matrix LS is the matrix of the
rational representation ν×, therefore its kernel has order the absolute value of
its determinant.

Corollary 2 Under the hypothesis in Theorem 1, the isogeny ν× is an iso-
morphism if and only if det(L{Hij }) = ±1.

Remark 3 1. The isogeny from Theorem 1 corresponds to a group algebra

decomposition isogeny ν as in (3).

2. We point out that the isogeny ν× depends on the choice of the subgroups
Hij for the set S. Therefore, its kernel may change if we change these
subgroups. Our purpose is to move along diﬀerent eﬀective sets in order to
achieve the smallest possible.

In the spirit of moving along diﬀerent eﬀective sets to minimize the order
of the kernel, we have the following proposition (see [13] for a proof and more
details).

Proposition 2 If H2 = gH1g−1 for some element g ∈ G, then
(i) pH2 = gpH1g−1,
(ii) Im(pH2 ) is isomorphic to Im(pH1 ).

Theorem 2 Let X be a Riemann surface of genus g with an action of a ﬁnite
group G such that the genus of X/G is zero. If S = {Hi1, ..., Hini } is an
eﬀective set for ν, then the induced polarization Eij of the factor Bij in ν is
given by

Eij = ΛHij EJX Λt

Hij .

(10)

Moreover, the type of the polarization Eij is given by the elementary divisors
of the matrix product (10).

10

Leslie Jim´enez

Remark 4 Finally we point out that the principle idea of our method is to move
along isomorphic varieties BH , choosing diﬀerent subgroups H (even in the
same conjugacy class) to construct the eﬀective set S and the corresponding
isogenies ν×, which may have kernels of diﬀerent orders. This shows that the
geometry of the varieties BH as subvarieties of JX makes a diﬀerence. In fact
the examples suggest that this reﬂects the way the subvarieties intersect each
other.

5 Application to trigonal curves

In this section we use the method explained in Section 3, the computational
program MAGMA [6] and the algorithm introduced in [3]. To obtain the size
of the kernel we use the full automorphism group of the curves. We study the
Jacobians of families of trigonal curves up to genus g < 10. We divide our
examples according to the genus (or the dimension) g.

5.1 Known facts about 3−gonal curves and their automorphisms

A compact Riemann Surface X admitting a cyclic prime group of automor-
phisms C3 of order 3 such that X/C3 has genus 0 is called a cyclic 3−gonal
surface or a trigonal curve. The group C3 is called a 3−gonal group for X. If
C3 is normal in the full automorphism group Aut(X) of X, we call X a nor-
mal cyclic 3−gonal surface or a normal trigonal curve. In this case, there exist
only one 3−gonal group for X. The quotient group NAut(x)(C3)/C3 between
the normalizer NAut(x)(C3) of C3 ≤ Aut(X) and C3 is called the reduced group
of X. It is well known [12, section IV.9.3], [31, Table 1] that the reduced group
of X can be the cyclic group Cn of order n, the dihedral group Dn of order
2n, the symmetric group S4, the alternating groups A4 or A5.

A consequence of [1, Lemma 2.1] is the following result:

Lemma 2 If X is a trigonal surface of genus g ≥ 5, then X is a normal
trigonal curve.

The previous result allows us to ﬁnd a list of automorphism groups of
trigonal curves (see also [2]). This list is obtained by an easy combination
of [32, Table 7], [5, Table 1] and [19], plus the computation of the reduced
groups which are not in the original tables. We group the results in Tables
1 and 2. Table 1, corresponds to non-normal trigonal curves. CD denotes
the central diagonal subgroup of SL(2, 3) of order 2. Table 2, corresponds to
normal trigonal curves with reduced group A4, S4 or A5 [5]. We restrict to
these reduced groups in the normal case mainly because the results in [23]
suggest that these families may have completely decomposable Jacobians (at
least for some dimensions of JX). From Table 2 we obtain the result that any
trigonal curve with reduced group S4, A4 or A5 has even genus, and that there
do not exist trigonal curves of genus 8 with reduced group A4, S4 or A5.

Table 2 Full automorphism group for normal trigonal curves

Note that in both tables we use the MAGMA notation ID to label the
automorphism groups. This is denoted by a ordered pair which in the ﬁrst entry
is the size of the group and in the second entry is which group in MAGMA
database it is.

Genus 2

Let X2 be the 3-gonal curve of genus two admitting the action of GL(2, 3) =
ha, b : a8 = b3 = (ab)2 = ba−3ba−3 = 1h (see the ﬁrst row in the Table 1).
This curve is known as the Bolza curve with equation y2 = x(x4 − 1). The
generating vector of the action is (a, b, (ab)) of type (0; 8, 3, 2).

Genus 3

The genus 3 surface in Table 1, corresponds to the curve with plane model
y4 = x3 − 1 (see [19, Table 2]) with action of SL(2, 3)/CD. We consider the
presentation SL(2, 3)/CD = ha, b : a12 = b3 = (ab)2 = a11b−1aba−1ba−7 = 1i.
The generating vector of the action is (a, b, ab) of type (0; 12, 3, 2).

Genus 4

The genus 4 surfaces in Table 1, correspond to the case studied in [1] and
[20]. The surfaces admit four actions of C3; two conjugate with quotients of
genus 0 and two non conjugate with quotients of genus 2. Moreover, the one
dimensional locus, corresponding to surfaces of genus 4 with automorphism
group D3 × D3 consists of the curves with equation ax3y3 − (x3 + y3) + a = 0,
where a /∈ {0, ±1, ∞}. This family contains the surface with action of (C3 ×

C3)⋊D4 (see [19, Table 4]). Then, we use the action of D3×D3. We consider the
presentation D3 × D3 = ha, b, c|a3 = b2 = c2 = (abc)2 = a2ca−1bca−1b−1a−2 =
a2ca−1bab−1ac−1a−1 = 1i. The generating vector of the action is (a, b, c, abc)
of type (0; 3, 2, 2, 2).

On the other hand, with respect to the groups in Table 2, we have that
C3 × A4 and C3 × S4 act on genus 4. The group C3 × A4 is contained in C3 × S4
and we study the possible actions of both groups on this genus. Using [6] and
[3], we note that they act over the same surface given by the planar model
y3 = x(x4 − 1) ([24]). This result completes the one remaining case left open
in [1] which was studied later in [19] and [20]. Our result coincide with they
obtained. The action of A4 × C3 (see Table 2) extends to the action of the
group S4 × C3 = ha, b|a12 = b3 = (ab)2 = a11ba−1bab−1ab−1a−6 = 1i with
generating vector (a, b, ab) of type (0; 12, 3, 2) (see [20]).

Genus 6

The groups ((C2 × C2) ⋊ C9) ⋊ C2 and (C2 × C2) ⋊ C9 act on curves of
genus 6. The group (C2 × C2) ⋊ C9 is contained in ((C2 × C2) ⋊ C9) ⋊ C2 and
we study their possible actions on this genus using [6] and [3]. Both groups
act on the same trigonal curve [19] with planar model y3 = x8 + 14x4 + 1 [26].
The group ((C2 × C2) ⋊ C9) ⋊ C2 = ha, b|a2 = b9 = (ab)4 = ab3ab3 = 1i acts
on the curve with generating vector (a, b, (ab)−1) of type (0; 2, 9, 4).

Remark 5 From Table 2, we know that there do not exist trigonal curves of
genus 8 with reduced group A4, S4 and A5.

5.2 Application of the method to trigonal curves

In this section we apply our method to trigonal curves. Let Ej denotes an
elliptic curve and |Kernel| denotes the smallest possible order for the kernel of
ν×, the isogeny deﬁned in 4.

Theorem 3 Let JX be the Jacobian variety of a trigonal curve X, of one of
the types detailed below. Then JX is completely decomposable, and a geomet-
rical description of the decomposition is in the following tables.

– If JX is the Jacobian variety of a non-normal trigonal curve, then we have

the following results:

Proof We will show here the techniques applied to the group GL(2, 3) in order
to limit the size of the matrices. The rest of the cases are proved following the
same procedure. The reader is referred to [13] for explicit calculations.

We use our method, presented in Chapter 2. All the computations were
made in the software package MAGMA [6]. The subgroups we use to obtain
the eﬀective set giving the decomposition satisfy both conditions of Lemma
1. Hence, the factors that will deﬁne B× in the isogeny ν× will correspond to
Jacobian varieties of intermediate coverings.

Let X2 : y2 = x(x4 − 1) be the Bolza curve described in the case of
genus 2 viewed before. A generating vector for this action is (a, b, (ab)) of
type (0; 8, 3, 2). Using equation (3) we obtain that the Jacobian variety JX
associated to X is completely decomposable i.e. isogenous to a product of
elliptic curves. In fact, the group algebra decomposition isogeny is ν : B41 ×
B42 ∼ JX, where the product B41 ×B42 is invariant by the irreducible rational
representation V4 of degree 2 (see Table 3).

To apply our method to ﬁnd an explicit decomposition ν×, we ﬁrst look
for two subgroups H1 and H2 of GL(2, 3) satisfying conditions of Lemma 1.
To ﬁnd these subgroups, we use the symplectic representation of the action
obtained from the method given in [3]. This allows us to write every element
of GL(2, 3) as a square symplectic matrix of size 4.

We determine next the complex irreducible representation decomposition of
the induced representation IndG
H 1H in GL(2, 3) by the trivial representation in
H for each H ≤ G (See Table 4). We know that this decomposition of IndG
H 1H
into C−irreducible representations is invariant under conjugation (see Remark
2). Table 5.2 shows the multiplicity of each complex irreducible representation
in the induced representation IndG

H 1H, for all H ≤ G up to conjugacy.

We observe that the only conjugacy class of subgroups of GL(2, 3) whose
elements satisfy the conditions in Lemma 1 consists of the class of H = habi.
For each subgroup H in this class

hIndG

H 1H, V4i = 1.

By Lemma 1, each factor in the decomposition of JX is deﬁned by B4j =
Im(pHj ) = VHj /ΛHj , where Hj is some subgroup in the class and j ∈ {1, 2}.

Table 4 Decomposition of the induced representation by the trivial one on each class of
conjugation of subgroups of GL(2, 3).

We obtain ν× : B41 × B42 → JX, and its kernel depends on the choice of Hj
in this class.

To give an explicit description of the subgroups of GL(2, 3) giving the
smallest order for the kernel of ν×, we consider the above presentation of
GL(2, 3) and the same generating vector (a, b, ab). Set H = habi, and consider
the following subgroups of order 2 in GL(2, 3)

H1 = H b = hba7bi,
H2 = H = habi,

and write B41 = Im(pH1 ) and B42 = Im(pH2 ). Since

ρs(pH1 ) =

and the coordinate matrices of their lattices are



0 0 1 1(cid:19) ,

we ﬁnd that the matrix coordinate of the lattice of the product B41 × B42 is
given by

L{H1,H2} = 


0 1 0 0
0 0 1 2
1 1 0 0
0 0 1 1

.




In this case, choosing H1 and H2 as before ν× : B41 × B42 → JX is an iso-
morphism. Hence |Ker(ν)| = 1. Note that we do not claim that the subgroups

yielding an isomorphism are unique. In fact, there exist other subgroups in the
same class such that the |Ker(ν×)| = 1.

Remark 6 Finally, combining Theorem 3 and the classiﬁcation of [19], we may
describe part of the loci of Jacobians of trigonal curves for dimension g ≤ 6.
