To explain the extremely high energy release, > 1053 erg, suggested by the observations of some Gamma-Ray
Bursts (GRBs), we propose a new energy extraction mechanism from the rotational energy of a Kerr-Newman
black hole (BH) by a massive photon ﬁeld. Numerical studies show that this mechanism is stable with respect to
the black hole rotation parameter, a, with a clear dependence on the BH mass, M, and charge, Q, and can extract
energies up to 1054 erg. The controversial “energy crisis” problem of GRBs that does not show evidence for
collimated emission may beneﬁt from this energy extraction mechanism. With these results we set a lower bound
on the coupling between electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds.

The exact Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) energy production
mechanism is still a matter of debate. One possible expla-
nation is the energy release during the formation of a rotating
black hole (BH) surrounded by the matter of a rapidly collaps-
ing massive star and, to account for the high energy observed,
one has to ﬁnd very efﬁcient energy extraction mechanisms
from the BH [1–3]. Other possible mechanisms can be high-
energy phenomena of energy pulse from electron-positron pair
production and the photon plasma ﬂuid created by vacuum po-
larization in the dyadosphere [4, 5], a region around a charged
BH that extends from the exterior event horizon r+ to a given
radius rds that depends on the mass and charge of the BH [6–9].
Vacuum polarization effects require strong magnetic ﬁelds
that mimic the effects of a charged and rotating BH described
by the Kerr-Newman solution [10]. However, because typical
astrophysical systems show a strong tendency to eliminate any
net electric charge, a charged BH is not a realistic physical
solution and cannot be generated by the gravitational collapse
of a core larger than the neutron star critical mass endowed
with an electromagnetic ﬁeld. A reasonable physical solution
is to consider energy extraction mechanisms where a BH that
“acquires” a temporary ﬁctitious net charge because of vac-
uum polarization effects and/or generates an electrostatic ﬁeld
that extends towards the neighborhoods of the event horizon
through a selective capture of charged particles. This tempo-
rary ﬁctitious charge is expected to dissipate on time scales
τ < 107 s, long enough to set up the GRB energy extraction
mechanisms occurring on much shorter time scales during the
collapse of the star and thus justify the use of Kerr-Newman
based spacetimes [4, 5].

As described in Ref. 11, photons can acquire mass due to
gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁeld coupling. Exploiting
this possibility, we here describe a new mechanism of energy
extraction from black-hole rotational energy made possible
by vacuum polarization effects occurring in the dyadosphere

around a Kerr-Newman BH.

The main motivation for this work arises from observations
of GRBs that do not show evidence of collimated emission [12–
16]. As shown, e.g., by Amati and Della Valle [17], GRBs
have a distribution of released energy, in terms of equivalent
isotropic radiation peaking at about Eiso ∼ 1053 erg or higher,
e.g., GRB 130427A; see [18]. In some cases they seem to be
able to have up to Eiso ∼ 1054 erg, corresponding to emitting
one Sun rest mass energy in 1–2 minutes.

The collimated emission scenario often called for to solve
this “energy crisis” implies the detection in the light curves of
the afterglow of a sudden “achromatic’’ change in the slope
(break) at the time when the relativistic beaming angle becomes
larger than the physical jet opening angle as a consequence
of the slowing down of the ejected shells [19]. Based on this
method, beaming angles between 4 and 9 degrees can be
estimated for a number of GRBs [14, 20–22], decreasing their
energy budget to below ∼ 5× 1052 erg. This is comparable
to the kinetic energy of so called hypernovae, a sub-class of
SNe-Ibc often associated with GRBs [23].

However, in some cases this change in the slope is not ob-
served [13–16], suggesting that some GRBs could be character-
ized by poorly collimated emission. A quasi-isotropic emission
is indeed often observed in low-luminosity GRBs [24], but in
this case the energy crisis is avoided by the low amount of
energy associated with Eiso ∼ 1050 erg, as shown in Fig. 1.
However the existence of high-luminosity GRBs [24, 26] that
do not exhibit an “achromatic” change in the slope of the after-
glow lightcurves, poses the question to pinpoint an alternative
mechanism of energy production in GRBs other than the ones
normally adopted, such as “failed supernovae” [27, 28] and
magnetars [29–31] and able to justify up to ∼ 1054 erg.
We ﬁnd that the energy extraction from a Kerr-Newman BH
by a massive photon (vector) ﬁeld can be as large as ∼ 1054 erg,
which is indeed the upper limit of the energy budget observed

pling between the electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁeld to
modify spacetime curvature and the energy extraction. This
can happen in this scenario, the core of the collapsing star is
thought to be surrounded by a plasma during the BH formation,
photons acquire a virtual mass through the Anderson-Higgs
mechanism [36, 37] as a hidden gauge invariance of the Proca-
Maxwell equations preserving the Lorentz invariance [38]. The
Proca-Maxwell Lagrangian density L describing a massive
γ AµAµ /2
electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld contains a mass term µ2

with the constraint derived from the massive photon in a
medium (∂ µAµ = 0). Proca-Maxwell equations include a mass-
like term for the photon due to light-matter interaction, viz., a
term encompassing the photon’s interaction with the plasma
(photon-plasmon interactions).

Photons and plasmas themselves gravitate, but not their
coupling, unless a non-minimal coupling of the EM vector po-
tential to gravity is present in the Lagrangian, LR = ξ RAνAν,
where R is the curvature scalar and ξ a coupling constant. Be-
cause of this, photons carry a ﬁnite rest mass, and an additional
term appears in Einstein’s equations. This coupling is thought
to occur, e.g., in the presence of a charge asymmetry [11] as
is supposed to happen in regions near the forming BH of a
GRB. An exhaustive theoretical description of this coupling is
beyond the scope of this Letter and would need a deep under-
standing of a possible uniﬁcation between electromagnetism
and gravitation.

The stress-energy tensor of Proca-Maxwell equations would
not be traceless like that of Maxwell’s equations, but due to
symmetry breaking and EM and gravitational coupling, the
total photon “Proca mass” would introduce an additional mass
term, being intrinsically gravitating and thus included as a
source in Einstein’s equations. When photons acquire such an
additional mass term, the spacetime curvature is unavoidably
modiﬁed and the environment around the BH is endowed with a
massive vector ﬁeld described by the Proca-Maxwell equations
of the EM ﬁeld. See, e.g., Refs. 40–43 for more details.

If the plasma is turbulent, then one has to consider an addi-
tional effect due to the spatial structure of the plasma itself at
the plasma resonance frequencies. In fact, unlike the mathe-
matical structure of the space-time manifold described by the

Isotropic radiated energy distribution of GRBs, Eiso,

w.r.t. their redshift (see Ref. 17 and references therein). Red tri-
angles indicate those GRBs that exhibit almost spherical emission
(sub-energetic, e.g., GRB 980425 and GRB 060218 [24]) or those
whose optical follow-up provided evidence of no, or a late, charac-
teristic break (see the compilation by Chandra and Frail [25]) and
thus are supposed to have a low degree of collimation (see text). In
this case Eiso can give the correct order of magnitude of the radiated
energy.

in GRB events [32, 33].

The presence of an electrostatic charge on the BH unavoid-
ably decreases the efﬁciency of the BH energy extraction pro-
cess if charged particles are accreting [34]. For this reason, the
charged particles that form the plasma around the BH cannot
provide a fully efﬁcient energy extraction in the Penrose pro-
cess that would generate the energy needed to form a GRB.
One way of increasing the energy emission is to include also
the contribution of additional resources such as accreting mas-
sive neutral vector ﬁelds. Massive Proca-Maxwell photons or
massive vector ﬁeld non-minimally coupled to gravitation due
to dark energy [35] represent a possibility.

Because of the scenario involved in regions surrounding the
BH as described by the dyadosphere model [4, 5], where the
vacuum is polarized and processes of pair production, annihila-
tion and oscillation lead to the formation of a high-energetic
and dense plasma of electrons, positrons and photons. Because
of number equipartition, electron-positron pairs number den-
sities are asymptotically comparable to that of photons that
obey Proca-Maxwell vector ﬁelds. A massive photon Proca-
Maxwell ﬁeld has no electric charge and non-zero rest mass
under the particular conditions described below. Being neutral
particles, their extraction energy efﬁciency from the BH is not
affected the by temporary Kerr-Newman electrostatic charge.
The electromagnetic (EM) potential enters actively into the en-
ergy budget of the Penrose process, and the ﬁnite rest mass of
the photon plays a crucial rôle, changing the spacetime metrics
and increasing the total energy extraction.

The generation of a massive photon ﬁeld requires a space-
time symmetry breaking of Maxwell’s equations and a cou-

Lorentz group in which space is homogeneous and isotropic
and time homogeneous, a plasma may exhibit peculiar spa-
tial/temporal structures that break the space-time symmetry
and generates the conversion of a fraction of the Proca mass
into photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) that acts as
a mass reducing term in the photon Proca mass [37, 39, 44].
In this case the OAM term changes the mass in the Proca-
Maxwell equations and the Yukawa potential of the space-time

curvature [45, 46], preserving, in any case, the sign of the norm
of the metric tensor, (cid:107)g(cid:107) as the acquired mass never becomes
negative [44].

Accretion of a massive neutral ﬁeld in the dyadosphere is
much more efﬁcient than accretion involving charged particles
and can supply or even replace the electromagnetic pulse that is
expected to occur to generate the GRB. Moreover, the presence
of these massive photons modify the original Kerr-Newman
metric by introducing a Yukawa potential that depends on the
electrostatic charge Q of the BH, via the term Ξ(Q) describing
the charge asymmetry. For the simplest model of charged BH,
one obtains Ξ(Q) = Q2/4π.

The modiﬁed Kerr-Newman metric in natural units where
e = G = c = 1, and in the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates
(t,r,θ ,ϕ), with the presence of the massive photon ﬁeld also
carrying OAM, becomes

ﬁnd that the Yukawa potential is always conﬁned between
the radii r1 = 2.95 × 106 cm and r2 = 2.81 × 107 cm. The
numerical results indicate that energy produced by the Penrose
extraction process of the massive photon ﬁeld provides the
lacking of energy budget required to reach the 1054 erg needed
for isotropic emission, having the same order of magnitude
as in the GRB process, 1047–1054 erg, as reported in Tab. I
The lower bounds on photon mass values obtained by varying
(cid:96) as a free integer parameter, are those derived from massive
vector ﬁelds, according to Refs. 42 and 43 in the range of
µγ ∼ 10−53–10−51 g.

We observe a strong dependence on the BH mass M and
charge Q, whereas the BH rotation parameter, a, plays a minor
rôle. These values allow us to set the lower bound for the
coupling constant between the EM and gravitational ﬁeld to
ξ ∼ 10−38.

Accretion onto a Kerr-Newman black hole of massive neu-
tral vector ﬁelds can explain the “energy crisis” problem of
GRBs. Photons propagating in a structured plasma and in
a strong gravitational ﬁeld acquire mass and orbital angu-
lar momentum because of the hidden gauge invariance due
to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism in Proca-Maxwell equa-
tions when there is an effective coupling between the gravita-
tional and electromagnetic ﬁelds. The interplay between BH
mass, charge, and rotation for the energy extraction from the

neutrally-charged massive photon ﬁeld gives the correct order
of magnitude of the energy expected for a GRB, showing a
strong dependence on the charge Q, with the result of dimin-
ishing the importance of the rotation parameter in the energy
extraction from the BH. This effect, similar to that provided
by charged particles falling into the BH [34], could ﬂatten the
possible differences in the energy distribution due to differently
rotating BHs.

Superradiant instabilities because of the small mass of the
BH in the GRB precursor considered in our calculations do
not play a crucial rôle in the too rapid formation of the GRB.
The effects induced by the plasma turbulence on the photon
mass, effective at the frequencies where the plasma is resonant,
seem not to play a signiﬁcant rôle in the energy extraction.
Moreover, this study could also be used in the energy budget
in massive neutrino-antineutrino ﬁreball models if the couples
so generated experience both a Penrose process and viscous
dissipation [47] or in the accretion of dark matter vector ﬁelds.
From our results we can set a lower bound for the coupling
constant between the EM and gravitational ﬁeld to ξ ∼ 10−38
that might contribute to electromagnetic emission also in those
scenarios where EM waves are not expected, such as in BH-BH
collisions, as hypothesized for the recent LIGO GW150914
gravitational wave detection and possible Fermi event coin-
cidence observed after 0.4 s in the electromagnetic spectrum.
[48–50].

The effect of this ﬁeld coupling might also be accompanied
with other non-linear gravitational wave interactions with plas-
mas [51]. No direct transfer of OAM from Kerr metric lensing
to photons [52] has been considered because of the physical
properties inside the dyadosphere.
