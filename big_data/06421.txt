Observed eﬃciencies of industrial power plants are often approximated by the

square-root formula: 1 −(cid:112)T−/T+, where T+(T−) are the highest (lowest) tem-

perature achieved in the plant. This expression can be derived within ﬁnite-time

thermodynamics, or, by entropy generation minimization, based on ﬁnite rates of

processes. A closely related quantity is the optimal value of the intermediate tem-

√

T+T−. It

perature for the hot stream, which is given by the geometric-mean value:

is proposed to model the operation of plants by quasi-static work extraction models,

with one reservoir (source/sink) as ﬁnite, while the other as practically inﬁnite. No

simplifying assumption is made on the nature of the ﬁnite system. This description is

consistent with two model hypotheses, each yielding a speciﬁc value of the intermedi-

ate temperature. We show that the expected value of the intermediate temperature,

deﬁned as the arithmetic mean, is very closely given by the geometric-mean value.

The deﬁnition is motivated as the use of inductive inference in the presence of limited

information.

Introduction: In recent years, there has been a great interest in extending thermody-

namic models to justify the observed performance of industrial power plants [1–4]. The

observed eﬃciencies are usually much less than the Carnot limit

ηC = 1 − T−
T+

,

(1)

evaluated on the basis of the highest (T+) and the lowest (T−) temperatures, for the partic-

ular plant. Naturally, real machines operate under irreversibilities caused by various factors,

like ﬁnite rates of heat transfer and ﬂuid ﬂow, internal friction, heat leakage and so on, unlike

the idealized quasi-static processes of a reversible cycle. Thus the analysis of irreversible

models with ﬁnite-rate processes seems a reasonable goal to pursue. One often-studied mea-

sure is the eﬃciency at maximum power of an irreversible model which is then compared

with the observed eﬃciency of these plants.

The earliest known such model is ascribed to Reitlinger [5], which involved a heat ex-

changer receiving heat from a ﬁnite hot stream fed by a combustion process. An analogous

model was applied to a steam turbine by Chambadal [6]. The considered heat exchanger

in these models is eﬀectively inﬁnite. Novikov [7] considered the heat transfer process be-

tween a hot stream and a ﬁnite heat exchanger with a given heat conductance. Two, simple

but signiﬁcant, assumptions enter these models:

i) constant speciﬁc heat of the inlet hot

stream and ii) validity of Newton’s law for heat transfer. Further, there appears a ﬂoating,

temperature variable in between the highest and the lowest values, such as the temperature

of the exhaust warm stream, over which the output power can be optimized. This yields

an optimal value of the intermediate temperature which is usually found to be

geometric mean of T+ and T−. Related to this fact, is the conclusion that the eﬃciency at

√
T+T−, the

maximum power is given by an elegant expression:

(cid:115)

ηCA = 1 −

T−
T+

.

(2)

Due to historical imperative [8], the above expression may be called Reitlinger-Chambadal-

Novikov eﬃciency. However, more recently it was rediscovered by Curzon and Ahlborn (CA)

[1]. Thus in the physics literature, it is more popularly addressed as CA-value. This latter

model considered ﬁnite rates of heat transfer at both the hot and the cold contacts, but

also explicitly considered the times allocated to these contacts. The average power per cycle

may be optimized over these times [1], or alternately, over the intermediate temperature

3

variables [9]. This model spawned much activity and the new area borne thereforth was

termed Finite-time Thermodynamics [10]. In the engineering literature, the corresponding

approach is called Entropy Generation Minimization [2, 11].

A positive indication for the simple thermodynamic approach is that the actually observed

eﬃciencies of industrial plants happen to be quite close to CA-value. Fig.1 shows this

comparison as tabulated in Table I. Although the agreement is close, the observed values

can be higher, or lower, than CA-value. This apparent discrepency has stimulated further

extensions of models, for instance using the low-dissipation assumption [3], which predict

the eﬃciency at maximum power, to be bounded as:

ηC
2

≤ η ≤ ηC
2 − ηC

.

(3)

It is then realized that most of the observed eﬃciencies fall within these bounds [3, 4].

FIG. 1. Data on the observed eﬃciencies (ηo) of power plants, plotted against the CA-value,

ηCA = 1−(cid:112)T−/T+ for respective plants as given in Table I. A point lying on the straight line has

the observed eﬃciency equal to CA-value. So for points above the line, ηo is below the CA-value,

while the converse is true for the points below this line.

Naturally, the question of the actual working constraints and the real optimization targets

for each plant, is also relevant. Still, the eﬀectiveness of these simple models, in reproducing

the gross features of diverse plants, cannot be denied.

Apart from ﬁnite-time models, the irreversibilities reducing the eﬃciency to a lower-than-

Carnot value, may also be treated within a quasi-static work extraction models with ﬁnite

source/sink [13–16]. Some of these studies also derive the optimal value of an intermediate

temperature which is the geometric-mean value, and consequently the eﬃciency at maximum

work equals the CA-value. However, here again, the simplifying assumption of a constant

heat capacity, say, of the source or the working medium, heavily determines the conclusion.

More recently, it was observed [17] that within linear response theory, the bounds such

as Eq. (3), also follow within a quasi-static model of work extraction from ﬁnite-sized heat

source and sink. Ref.

[17] makes no speciﬁc assumption about the nature of the heat

source/sink. The present study is motivated by this analysis, and aims to study the perfor-

mance of real plants within a quasi-static approach. More precisely, we address an inverse

question.

Instead of ﬁnding the optimal intermediate temperature and then from it, the

eﬃciency of the process, we use the information on the highest and the lowest tempera-

5

tures, along with the value of observed eﬃciency, to infer the intermediate temperature at

maximum work. The correspondence between this temperature and eﬃciency is as follows.

If the former is exactly equal to the geometric-mean value, then the eﬃciency is equal to

CA-value. The model of work extraction is based on one system as a ﬁnite source, or sink,

and the other as an inﬁnite reservoir, which allows for two alternate scenarios:

i) when

the source is ﬁnite and ii) when the sink is ﬁnite. The limited information on the actual

situation being realized out of these two possibilities, motivates to do an inference analysis.

Thus we estimate an expected value of the intermediate temperature scale. Interestingly,

this value is found to be very close to the geometric mean of T+ and T−. We also present

a quantitative argument for this proximity to the geometric-mean value. Thus our analysis

indicates the role of geometric mean from a novel angle which has two distinctive features:

ﬁrst, it is based on maximum work approach, and second, we do not per se assume a specﬁc

nature of the ﬁnite source or sink.

Our starting point is the reversible cycle operating between two inﬁnite heat reservoirs,

for which the eﬃciency is the Carnot value ηC. As a ﬁrst step marking a deviation from

reversibility, we consider one reservoir as ﬁnite, while the other reservoir remains very large

compared to the former, or practically inﬁnite. Now, we ﬁrst assume that system A acts

as a ﬁnite heat sink at temperature T−, relative to a very large heat source at temperature

T+. The two are coupled by an ideal engine which delivers work to a reversible work source,

by running in inﬁnitesimal heat cycles, that successively increase the temperature of A, till

A comes in equilibrium with the source, see Fig.1 (i). At this point, the extracted work

is maximum. Suppose that in this process, the system A moves from an equilibrium state

characterized by energy U− and entropy S− to an equilibrium state with the corresponding
values of U+ and S+. The heat removed from the source is Q+ = T+(S+ − S−). The heat
rejected to the ﬁnite sink is q+ = U+ − U−. The work extracted is given by W+ = Q+ − q+,
or

W+ = T+(S+ − S−) − (U+ − U−).

Then the eﬃciency at maximum work, η+ = W+/Q+, is evaluated to be:

ature of an inﬁnite reservoir [18], such that the present situation of an inﬁnite source and a

ﬁnite sink, at temperatures T+ and T− respectively, is equivalent to maximum work extrac-

Now, we assume that the information on the nature of system A is not available, or, in

other words, T (+)

m is not given. But if the quasi-static model with an inﬁnite source and a

ﬁnite sink, is a good model for the observed performance of an industrial plant, then we
may infer the relevant value of the eﬀective temperature T (+)

m , when the theoretical eﬃciency

(η+) for the model is set equal to the observed value ηo. This implies that we write

m = T+(1 − ηo).

However, the scenario of work extraction from a ﬁnite system coupled to an inﬁnite

coupled to an inﬁnite sink at T−, see Fig. 2 (ii). Here again, we can extract maximal work

by utilizing the temperature gradient between B and the reservoir, till B comes to be at
temperature T− [19]. Assuming that the system goes from some equilibrium state (U(cid:48)

to another one (U(cid:48)

It is clear from the expressions for W− and η−, that an equivalence exists between the above

model and that of work extraction in a reversible cycle from two inﬁnite reservoirs at T−
and T (−)

m (> T−).

Now again, to apply the above case to model an industrial plant, we can equate the

observed eﬃciency to the theoretical eﬃciency, as ηo = η− and infer the corresponding
eﬀective temperature T (−)

m from Eq. (9), as

comparison to G(T+, T−).

The following remark seems appropriate here. An analogy may be made between the

above model and the earlier irreversible models such as proposed by Chambadal [2, 6], in

which an intermediate temperature Tw (of the warm exit stream) enters the analysis and
the theoretical eﬃciency of the model is 1− T−/Tw (compare with Eq. (9)). For an optimal
T+T−, the power output becomes optimal with the corresponding eﬃciency
value Tw =

√

equal to CA-value. The crucial diﬀerences, from our model, are twofold: a) we study quasi-

static maximum work extraction process b) the nature of system B, the ﬁnite source, is not

speciﬁed.

Now as observed in Figs. 3 and 4, the values of eﬀective temperatures seem to be

9

distributed, apparently in a random fashion, about the geometric-mean value. However, it
is remarkable to note that for a given plant, the calculated values of T (+)

m and T (−)

m are such

that, to a high accuracy, they are equidistant from the geometric mean G. More precisely,
if we deﬁne an average value of temperature T (av)

(12)

Then the above average value is found to be closely approximated by G(T+, T−) for most

observed cases of industrial plants, see Fig. 5, as well as Table I.

Now, we turn to a more quantitative characterization of the above observation.

It is

The second aspect is related to the observation made earlier that the deviations in values

Finally, we address the meaning of the average eﬀective temperature. If we again consider

the two extreme situations envisaged in Fig. 2, then they are mutually exclusive, or one may

say, they are counterfactual. The average temperature is not necessarily seen in an actual
realization, except for the special case T (+)

inference [21, 22]. In latter terms, the average temperature represents an expected scale of

the eﬀective temperature, in view of our inability to choose between the two alternatives (i)

and (ii), where each represent our hypothesis for the model of work extraction applicable to

the plant. In inference, when one of, say, two mutually exclusive hypotheses cannot be given

a preference over the other, then we must assign equal weights to the inferences derived from
each [22, 23]. The eﬀective temperatures T (±)
on the observed eﬃciency, and, so T (av)

m , deﬁned with equal weights assigned to both the

m are our inferred values from the given data

inferences, represents the expected value of the eﬀective temperature, commensurate with

the information at our disposal. Any deviation from equal weights would imply that we

have some extra piece of information about the process, and thus would be inconsistent [24].

Concluding, we have proposed to model the observed eﬃciencies, using the quasi-static

models of work extraction where one reservoir (hot or cold) is ﬁnite while the other is prac-

tically inﬁnite. This brings an extra scale of intermediate temperature into the analysis. We

note two consistent models depending on which reservoir is taken as ﬁnite, and consequently,

we get two possible values of the intermediate temperature. The limited information on the

working conditions does not allow to prefer one model hypothesis over the other and so an

equally-weighted average represents the expected scale of intermediate temperature. For

most of the power plants, this inferred value is found to be quite close to the geometric

mean of the highest and the lowest temperatures. Thus we rediscover the signiﬁcance of

11

the geometric-mean temperature, which was emphasized in earlier irreversible models of

plants [5–7, 25], but there it was often based on simplifying assumptions such as constant

heat capacity for the hot stream, and Newton’s law for heat transfer. Such assumptions

are not important in our analysis and we do not make use of a particular nature of the

ﬁnite reservoir. In the present approach, if the deviations in the observed eﬃciency from the

CA-value are small, then the geometric-mean temperature appears as a rational estimate

for the intermediate temperature.

An inference based approach has been used earlier to study models of thermodynamic

machines with limited information. The emergence of CA eﬃciency from inference has been

noted in quantum heat engine [26] and mesoscopic models like Feynman’s ratchet [27]. For

classical models of work extraction from two ﬁnite reservoirs, the results for eﬃciency at

maximum work are reproduced through inference, beyond linear response [28]. Further,

reversible models with limited information have been related to irreversible models through

inference based reasoning [29].

In the present context, it is remarkable how simple, but

general considerations can lead to estimates close to the geometric-mean value for the in-

termediate temperature. It is indeed curious to ask, how the inference approach leads to

the same conclusions as the simple irreversible models with constant heat capacity. Does

it indicate a connection between the simplicity of objective modelling and assuming min-

imal information in inference? More research is needed for a deeper understanding of the

connection between the use of limited information and thermodynamic modelling.

The purpose of inductive inference is not just to provide an academic and philosophical

point of view which may sometimes rival the more objective modelling we usually resort to

in science, but also seek how methods of inference can give insight into the actual state of

aﬀairs, while incorporating the prior information, normally not considered in thermodynamic

models. In this context, we note that although most of the data on plants yield an expected

value of the intermediate temperature close to geometric-mean value, still there are a couple

of not-so-insigniﬁcant deviations in Fig. 5, near the top right corner. A valid question is,

why do these examples diﬀer from the rest of the cases? Does it indicate other measures of

optimization being used in the actual operation? As far as the available data is concerned,

we note these plants operate under higher temperature gradients than most other plants.

Thus, one may argue that our model and the assumptions may not be good approximations

for large temperature diﬀerences. In any case, once we have noticed deviations from the

expected behavior in these plants, further studies on the actual working conditions may be

undertaken, which may then yield information to generalize the inference analysis, or may

help to improve the performance, at par with other plants.
