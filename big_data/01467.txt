BADLY APPROXIMABLE VECTORS AND FRACTALS
DEFINED BY CONFORMAL DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS

Abstract. We prove that if J is the limit set of an irreducible conformal iterated function system (with
either ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite alphabet), then the badly approximable vectors form a set of full Hausdorﬀ
dimension in J. The same is true if J is the radial Julia set of an irreducible meromorphic function (either
rational or transcendental). The method of proof is to ﬁnd subsets of J that support absolutely friendly
and Ahlfors regular measures of large dimension. In the appendix to this paper, we answer a question of
Broderick, Kleinbock, Reich, Weiss, and the second-named author (’12) by showing that every hyperplane
diﬀuse set supports an absolutely decaying measure.

Fix an integer d ≥ 1, and recall that a point (vector) x ∈ Rd is said to be badly approximable if there

exists c > 0 such that for any p ∈ Zd and q ∈ N, one has

1. Introduction

kqx − pk ≥ c/q1/d.

Denote the set of all badly approximable vectors in Rd by BAd. It is well-known that Lebesgue measure
of BAd is zero, but nevertheless this set is quite large: its Hausdorﬀ dimension is equal to d. When d = 1,
a number is badly approximable if and only if the partial quotients of its continued fraction expansion
are uniformly bounded. An analogous result when d > 1 is the Dani–Kleinbock–Margulis correspondence
principle [9, 18], according to which a vector is badly approximable if and only if a certain trajectory
in the homogeneous space SLd+1(R)/ SLd+1(Z) is bounded. However, this result does not allow one to
compute explicit examples of badly approximable vectors in the same way that one can write down arbitrary
continued fraction expansions with bounded partial quotients, and in fact, very few explicit examples of
badly approximable vectors in higher dimensions are known.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in computing the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the interesection of
BAd with various fractal sets. Since BAd has full dimension, one expects its intersection with any fractal
set J ⊆ Rd to have the same dimension as J, and this can be proven for certain broad classes of fractal
sets J. For example, Kleinbock and Weiss proved the following:

Theorem 1.1 ([19, Theorem 1.1]). Let µ be a ﬁnite measure 1 on Rd that is absolutely friendly (see below
for the deﬁnition). Then

and Supp(µ) denotes the topological support of µ. In particular, if µ is Ahlfors regular of dimension δ,2
then dimH (BAd ∩ Supp(µ)) = δ = dimH (Supp(µ)).
We recall that a measure µ is called doubling (or Federer ) if there exists a constant C > 0 such that for all
x ∈ Rn (equiv. for all x ∈ Supp(µ)) and for all r > 0, we have

Furthermore, µ is called absolutely decaying if there exist C, α, r0 > 0 such that for all x ∈ Supp(µ),
0 < r ≤ r0, and ε > 0, and for every aﬃne hyperplane L ⊆ Rn, we have

µ(B(x, 2r)) ≤ Cµ(B(x, r)).

where

µ (N (L, εr) ∩ B(x, r)) ≤ Cβαµ(B(x, r)),

N (L, εr) def= {x ∈ Rd : d(x, L) ≤ εr}

is the closed neighborhood of L of thickness εr. Finally, µ is called absolutely friendly if it is both doubling
and absolutely decaying.

Remark 1.2. More generally, Theorem 1.1 remains true if BAd is replaced by any hyperplane absolute
winning set; see [5] for the deﬁnition. Such a generalization can be proven by combining [20, Proposition
5.1] with [5, Propositions 4.7 and 5.1].

Several recent results involve verifying the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1 for measures supported on the
limit sets of various conformal dynamical systems, namely iterated function systems, Kleinian groups, and
rational functions:3

Theorem 1.3 ([51, Corollary 1.6] and [28, Lemma 3.14]). Let J be the limit set of a ﬁnite conformal IFS
on Rd, and suppose that J is not contained in any real-analytic hypersurface of Rd. Let δ = dimH (J). Then
the δ-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure restricted to J is absolutely friendly and Ahlfors regular of dimension
δ.

Theorem 1.4 ([44, Theorem 2] and [45, Theorem 2]). Let µ be the Patterson–Sullivan measure of a convex-
cocompact Kleinian group, and suppose that the limit set J = Supp(µ) is not contained in a generalized
sphere.4 Let δ = dimH (J). Then µ is absolutely friendly and Ahlfors regular of dimension δ.

Theorem 1.5 ([10, Theorem 1.10] and [46, Theorem 4 and its Corollary]). Let f : bC → bC be a hyperbolic

(i.e. expansive on its Julia set) rational function, let J be its Julia set, and suppose that J is not contained
in any generalized sphere. Let δ = dimH (J). Then the δ-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure restricted to J is
absolutely friendly and Ahlfors regular of dimension δ.

In all three of these cases, Theorem 1.1 implies that dimH (BAd ∩ J) = dimH (J). In the case of Theorem
1.3, we state this corollary for future reference:

Corollary 1.6. With notation as in Theorem 1.3, we have dimH (BAd ∩ J) = dimH (J).

Theorems 1.3-1.5 are reasonably optimal if one’s goal is to show that the limit set J of a given conformal
dynamical system supports an absolutely friendly and Ahlfors regular measure. (This is not quite true;
see Appendix A for a generalization of Theorem 1.5 where “hyperbolic” is replaced by “semi-hyperbolic”.)
But if one restricts to the more modest goal of showing that dimH (BAd ∩ J) = dimH (J), then they can be
vastly generalized. The idea is that although J may not be equal to the topological support of an absolutely
friendly and Ahlfors regular measure µ, it may be possible to ﬁnd such a measure µ whose support is a
subset of J. In this case Theorem 1.1 implies that dimH (BAd ∩J) ≥ dimH (µ), and so by ﬁnding a sequence
of measures (µn)∞
1 such that dimH (µn) ր dimH (J) we can show that dimH (BAd ∩ J) = dimH (J). Three
of the authors used this idea in a previous paper to prove the following result in the setting of Kleinian
groups:

2We recall that µ is said to be Ahlfors regular of dimension δ if there exists a constant C ≥ 1 such that for all x ∈ Supp(µ)

and r ∈ (0, 1], we have C−1rδ ≤ µ(B(x, r)) ≤ Crδ.

3See [11, Table 1] for a comparison of these diﬀerent settings, extending the traditional “Sullivan’s dictionary” to include

the setting of iterated function systems.

4Recall that a generalized sphere is either a sphere or the union of {∞} with an aﬃne hyperplane.

3

Theorem 1.7 ([16, Theorem 9.3]). Let Jr be the radial limit set of a Kleinian group, and suppose that Jr
is not contained in a generalized sphere. Then dimH (BAd ∩ Jr) = dimH (Jr).

Remark 1.8. Theorem 1.7 shows that for a geometrically ﬁnite group, we have dimH (BAd ∩J) = dimH (J)
unless J is contained in a generalized sphere. In general, the Patterson–Sullivan measures of such groups
are not necessarily absolutely friendly; cf. [10, Theorem 1.9].

In this paper, we develop this technique further and use it to prove analogues of Theorem 1.7 for the
other two types of conformal dynamical systems. Speciﬁcally, our main results are that if J is the limit set
of a conformal iterated function system with a countable alphabet, then dimH (BAd ∩ J) = dimH (J) (The-
orem 2.9), and that if Jr is the radial Julia set of a meromorphic dynamical system (i.e. a rational function
or a transcendental meromorphic function), then dimH (BA2 ∩ Jr) = dimH (Jr) (Theorem 3.15), in both
cases with an appropriate geometric irreducibility hypothesis. Other signiﬁcant results include Corollary
2.11 (extending Theorem 2.9 to certain graph directed Markov systems), Theorem 3.9 (proving that several
dynamically deﬁned quantities are all equal to dimH (Jr), indicating that it is the “natural” dynamical di-
mension of a meromorphic dynamical system), and Corollaries 3.17 and 3.18 (describing some special cases
in which Jr has the same Hausdorﬀ dimension as the total Julia set J, and thus dimH (BA2∩J) = dimH (J)).

2. Conformal graph directed Markov systems

and

iterated function systems

We now proceed to deﬁne iterated function systems (abbr.

IFSes) and their generalizations, graph
directed Markov systems (abbr. GDMSes). Such systems are studied at length in [28] and [29], respectively.
A directed multigraph consists of a ﬁnite set V of vertices, a countable (either ﬁnite or inﬁnite) set E of
directed edges, and two functions i, t : E → V . An incidence matrix on (V, E, i, t) is a map A : E × E →
{0, 1} such that for all e, f ∈ E with Aef = 1, we have t(f ) = i(e). Now suppose that in addition, we have a
collection of nonempty compact metric spaces {Xv}v∈V and a number λ ∈ (0, 1), and that for every e ∈ E,
we have a one-to-one contraction φe : Xt(e) → Xi(e) with Lipschitz constant ≤ λ. Then the collection

S = {φe : Xt(e) → Xi(e)}e∈E

is called a graph directed Markov system (or GDMS ). We now describe the limit set of the system S. For
every n ∈ N let

A is the set consisting of the empty word. Then consider the disjoint union

For each ω ∈ E∞

A , the sets {φω|n(cid:0)Xt(ωn)(cid:1)}n≥1 form a descending sequence of nonempty compact sets
and therefore Tn≥1 φω|n(cid:0)Xt(ωn)(cid:1) 6= (cid:31). Since for every n ≥ 1, diam(cid:0)φω|n(cid:0)Xt(ωn)(cid:1)(cid:1) ≤ λn diam(cid:0)Xt(ωn)(cid:1) ≤

λn max{diam(Xv) : v ∈ V }, we conclude that the intersection

is a singleton, and we denote its only element by π(ω). In this way we have deﬁned a map

\n∈N

φω|n(cid:0)Xt(ωn)(cid:1)
A → av∈V

Xv,

π : E∞

where`v∈V Xv is the disjoint union of the compact sets Xv (v ∈ V ). The map π is called the coding map,

and the set

is called the limit set of the GDMS S. The sets

J = JS

def= π(E∞
A )

are called the local limit sets of S.

Jv = π({ω ∈ E∞

A : i(ω1) = v})

(v ∈ V )

We call a GDMS S ﬁnite if its alphabet E is ﬁnite. Furthermore, we call S maximal if for all e, f ∈ E,
we have Aef = 1 if and only if t(f ) = i(e). In [29], a maximal GDMS was called a graph directed system
(abbr. GDS). Finally, we call S an iterated function system (or IFS ) if S is maximal and V , the set of
vertices of S, is a singleton. Equivalently, S is an IFS if the set of vertices of S is a singleton and all entries
of the incidence matrix A are equal to 1.

Deﬁnition 2.1. We call the GDMS S and its incidence matrix A ﬁnitely (symbolically) irreducible if there
exists a ﬁnite set Ω ⊆ E∗
A such that for all e, f ∈ E there exists a word ω ∈ Ω such that the concatenation
eωf is in E∗
A. S and A are called ﬁnitely primitive if the set Ω may be chosen to consist of words all having
the same length. If such a set Ω exists but is not necessarily ﬁnite, then S and A are called (symbolically)
irreducible and primitive, respectively. Note that all IFSes are symbolically irreducible.

Intending to pass to geometry, we call a GDMS conformal if for some d ∈ N, the following conditions

are satisﬁed (cf. [29, §4.2]):

(a) For every vertex v ∈ V , Xv is a compact connected subset of Rd, and Xv = Int(Xv).
(b) (Open Set Condition) For all e, f ∈ E such that e 6= f ,

φe(Int(Xt(e))) ∩ φf (Int(Xt(f ))) = (cid:31).

(c) There exist open connected sets Wv ⊇ Xv (v ∈ V ) such that for every e ∈ E, the map φe extends

to a C1 conformal diﬀeomorphism from Wt(e) into Wi(e) with Lipschitz constant ≤ λ.

(d) There are two constants L ≥ 1 and α > 0 such that for every e ∈ E and every two points

x, y ∈ Xt(e),

where |φ′

e)−1k−1ky − xkα,
ω(x)| denotes the scaling factor of the similarity matrix φ′

e(y)| − |φ′

e(x)|(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Lk(φ′

(cid:12)(cid:12)|φ′

ω(x).

Remark 2.2 ([29, Proposition 4.2.1]). If d ≥ 2 and a family S = {φe}e∈E satisﬁes the conditions (a) and
(c), then it also satisﬁes condition (d) with α = 1.

Remark 2.3. Our deﬁnition of a conformal GDMS diﬀers from that of [29] in that we do not assume
the cone condition (i.e.
[29, (4d) on p.72]). This is important because it will make it easier to prove
the existence of certain conformal IFSes in Section 3. Most of the results in [29] (and in particular the
ones we cite below, namely [29, Theorems 4.2.11 and 4.2.13]) do not depend on the cone condition. To
see this, it is helpful to illustrate how the key lemma [29, Lemma 4.2.6] can be proven without using the
cone condition. We sketch a proof as follows: First without loss of generality suppose that all elements
of F have comparable diameters. Then estimate from below the volumes of the sets (φω(Xt(ω)))ω∈F
using the bounded distortion property. Finally, use the fact that these sets are disjoint and contained in
B(x, r + maxω∈F diam(φω(Xt(ω)))) to get an upper bound on the sum of their volumes.

5

Deﬁnition 2.4. A conformal GDMS S on Rd is said to be (geometrically) irreducible if its limit set JS
is not contained in any real-analytic submanifold of Rd of dimension ≤ d − 1. Otherwise, it is called
(geometrically) reducible.

If the conformal IFS S is irreducible, its limit set JS is also called (geometrically) irreducible.

Remark 2.5. The reader should be careful about the distinction between the meaning of the word “ir-
reducible” considered here and the one considered in Deﬁnition 2.1. When it is not clear from context
which is meant, we use the adverbs “symbolically” and “geometrically” to clarify. Since IFSes are always
symbolically irreducible, the phrase “irreducible IFS” always refers to a geometrically irreducible IFS.

Proposition 2.6. Let S be a symbolically irreducible conformal GDMS.

(i) If S consists entirely of M¨obius transformations (and in particular if d ≥ 3), then S is geometrically

reducible if and only if for all v ∈ V , JS,v is contained in a generalized sphere.

(ii) If d = 2, then S is geometrically reducible if and only if there are conformal embeddings ψv : Wv →

C (v ∈ V ) such that ψv(JS,v) ⊆ R for all v ∈ V .

(iii) If S is geometrically irreducible, then S admits a ﬁnite geometrically irreducible subsystem.

Proof. The backwards directions of (i) and (ii) are both obvious. So suppose that S = {φe}e∈E is a
symbolically irreducible but geometrically reducible conformal GDMS, and ﬁx ω ∈ E∞
A such that each
letter of E occurs inﬁnitely often in ω. This is possible because S is assumed to be symbolically irreducible.
Let p = π(ω) ∈ JS. Then there exist a neighborhood U ∋ p and a real-analytic map f : U → R such that
f ′(p) 6= 0 and JS ∩ U ⊆ f −1(0).

Fix v ∈ V , and suppose that S consists entirely of M¨obius transformations. Then the family

(kφω|nk−1f ◦ φω|n )n≥n0,t(ω)=v

is a normal family, where n0 is chosen large enough so that all these maps are well-deﬁned.
Its limits
are all of the form π1 ◦ ψ, where π1 : Rd → R is projection onto the ﬁrst coordinate and ψ is a M¨obius
transformation. But JS,v is contained in the zero sets of these limits, which are generalized spheres. This
completes the proof of (i). (If d ≥ 3, then Liouville’s theorem on conformal mappings (see [17] for a detailed
development leading up to the strongest current version including references to the historical background)
guarantees that S consists entirely of M¨obius transformations.)

On the other hand, suppose that d = 2. By shrinking the set U if necessary, we may assume that f is the
imaginary part of a conformal embedding g : U → C. Now choose n large enough so that φω|n (Wv) ⊆ U ,
and let ψ = g ◦ φω|n . We have JS,v ⊆ ψ−1(R), which completes the proof of (ii).

We now begin the proof of (iii). Let S = {φe}e∈E be a symbolically irreducible conformal GDMS, and
suppose that all ﬁnite subsystems of S are geometrically reducible. Since S is symbolically irreducible, there
exists an increasing sequence (Sn)∞
Fix v ∈ V , and note that

1 of ﬁnite symbolically irreducible subsystems such that Sn Sn = S.

(2.1)

JS,v ⊆ [n∈N

JSn,v.

Now if d ≥ 3, then each of the sets JSn,v (n ∈ N) is contained in a generalized sphere. So by (2.1), JS,v is
contained in the geometric limit of generalized spheres, and such an object is also a generalized sphere.

If d = 2, then for each n ∈ N there is a conformal embedding ψn : Wv → C such that ψn(JS,v) ⊆ R.
n(pv)| = 1, where pv ∈ JS0,v is a distinguished
1 is a normal family.

This embedding may be chosen to satisfy ψn(pv) = 0 and |ψ′
point. But then by a corollary of Koebe’s distortion theorem [6, Theorem I.1.10], (ψn)∞
If ψ denotes one of its limits, then JS,v ⊆ ψ−1(R).

Finally, if d = 1, then S is geometrically reducible if and only if #(JS,v) = 1 for all v ∈ V , and it is easy
(cid:3)

to use this to get the desired conclusion.

Remark 2.7. Note that if F ⊆ S is a geometrically irreducible subsystem, then any subsystem F ′ ⊆ S
such that F ′ ⊇ F is also geometrically irreducible. So by (iii), if S is geometrically irreducible then all
suﬃciently large ﬁnite subsystems of S are geometrically irreducible.

Remark 2.8. We would like to comment on the usefulness of item (ii). It can be used to check irreducibility
in some circumstances where it would otherwise be diﬃcult, by using Koebe’s distortion theorem [6,
Theorem I.1.6]. For example, consider a conformal IFS whose limit set contains the vertices of a small
triangle. By Koebe’s distortion theorem, the images of these points under ψv must be almost similar to the
original triangle. But triangles in R are all degenerate, so this shows that only nearly degenerate triangles
can be contained in the limit set. So e.g.
if the limit set contains the vertices of an equilateral triangle
contained in B(0, 1/20), where W = B(0, 1), then the IFS must be irreducible.5

We are now ready to use Corollary 1.6 to prove the following result:

Theorem 2.9. If S = {φe : X → X}e∈E is an irreducible conformal IFS on Rd, then

dimH (BAd ∩ JS) = dimH (JS ).

def= {φe}e∈D
Proof. By Proposition 2.6(iii), there exists a ﬁnite set D ⊆ E such that the ﬁnite system SD
is irreducible. Since for every set F ⊇ D we have JF ⊇ JD, we conclude that for every F ⊇ D the system
SF is also irreducible. Thus by Corollary 1.6,

(2.2)

dimH (BAd ∩ JSF ) = dimH (JSF ).

Now by [29, Theorem 4.2.13] (cf. [29, Theorem 4.2.11]), we have dimH (JS ) = sup{dimH (JSF )}, where the
supremum is taken over all ﬁnite sets F ⊆ E, and by the monotonicity of Hausdorﬀ dimension the same is
true if the supremum is restricted to ﬁnite sets F ⊆ E that contain D. We infer from (2.2) that

dimH (BAd ∩ JS) ≥ sup{dimH (BAd ∩ JSF )} = sup{dimH (JSF )} = dimH (JS ),

where again both suprema are taken over all ﬁnite sets F ⊆ E containing D. This completes the proof. (cid:3)

As an immediate consequence of this theorem, we get the following:

Corollary 2.10. If S = {φe : X → X}e∈E is a conformal IFS on Rd such that dimH(JS ) > d − 1, then

dimH (BAd ∩ JS) = dimH (JS ).

We proceed to extend the Theorem 2.9 to the realm of GDMSes. If S = {φe : X → X}e∈E is a maximal
conformal GDMS, then we can canonically associate to it some conformal IFSes. Namely, if v ∈ V is a
vertex, then we can look at the set

E∗
v

def= {ω ∈ E∗

A : t(ω) = v, i(ω) = v, and ω has no proper subword with this property}.

Then

Sv

def= {φω : ω ∈ E∗
v }

is an IFS whose limit set is contained in JS,v. If the system S is geometrically irreducible, then so are all
the systems Sv (v ∈ V ). If in addition S is symbolically irreducible, then using the facts that Hausdorﬀ
dimension is σ-stable, increasing with respect to inclusions, and invariant under bi-Lipschitz maps, we get
that dimH (JSv ) = dimH (JS) for all v ∈ V . Therefore, as an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.9, we
get the following:

Corollary 2.11. If S = {φe : Xt(e) → Xi(e)}e∈E is a maximal conformal GDMS on Rd that is geometrically
irreducible and symbolically irreducible, then

dimH (BAd ∩ JS) = dimH (JS ).

5Precise calculation: Suppose that x, y, z ∈ B(0, 1/20) constitute an equilateral triangle, say |y − x| = |z − x| = |z − y| = r.

Then Koebe’s distortion theorem shows that

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ψv(y) − ψv(x)

ψv(z) − ψv(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

and similarly for the other permutations of x, y, z. This shows that ψv(x), ψv(y), ψv (z) cannot form a degenerate triangle,
since the ratio between the shortest and longest sides of a degenerate triangle is always at least 2.

3. Rational and transcendental functions

We now proceed to derive applications of Corollary 1.6 to meromorphic dynamics, rational and transcen-
dental alike. We consider the following two cases:

Case 1. D = bC, and f : D → bC is a rational function of degree at least two;
Case 2. D = C, and f : D → bC is a transcendental meromorphic function;

and commonly refer to them as meromorphic dynamical systems. We recall that the Fatou set of f consists
of all those points z ∈ D that admit some neighborhood Uz ⊆ D such that the iterates of f are well-deﬁned
on Uz and their restrictions to Uz form a normal family. The Julia set J = Jf of f is deﬁned to be the

7

complement of the Fatou set of f in bC. The Julia set Jf is a nonempty perfect subset of bC, enjoying the

following invariance properties:

f (Jf ∩ D) ⊆ Jf and f −1(Jf ) = Jf ∩ D.

Note that in Case 2, the Julia set contains ∞, but in Case 1, this may or may not be true. For the basic
properties of Julia sets of rational functions the reader is advised to consult the books [2, 6, 34, 37, 43] and
the survey article [50]; for the topological dynamics of transcendental functions the survey [4] is a good
place to start. We now give several deﬁnitions and notations:

Notation 3.1. In the sequel, given a point z ∈ C and a radius r > 0 we denote by Be(z, r) ⊆ C the

Euclidean open ball centered at z with radius r, while by Bs(z, r) ⊆ bC we denote the corresponding ball
deﬁned by means of the spherical metric onbC. We use similar notation for distances, thickenings, diameters,

and derivatives taken with respect to the Euclidean or spherical metrics.

Convention 1. The symbols ., &, and ≍ will denote coarse multiplicative asymptotics. For example,
A .K B means that there exists a constant C > 0 (the implied constant ), depending only on K, such that
A ≤ CB. In general, dependence of the implied constant(s) on universal objects will be omitted from the
notation.

Deﬁnition 3.2. The radial (or conical ) Julia set of f , denoted Jr(f ), or just Jr, consists of all those points
z ∈ Jf for which there exists δ > 0 such that for inﬁnitely many n ∈ N, the map f n admits an analytic
local inverse branch f −n

: Bs(f n(z), δ) → D sending f n(z) to z.

z

Remark 3.3. Several diﬀerent deﬁnitions of the “radial Julia set” have appeared in the literature. In the
context of rational functions, Deﬁnition 3.2 was the ﬁrst deﬁnition of the radial limit set; it appeared in [49]
after appearing implicitly in [25]. Alternative deﬁnitions appeared in [26, 35], but the original deﬁnition
came to be more popular [12, 33, 37, 50]. However, by the time Deﬁnition 3.2 was generalized to the
context of transcendental functions [40, 1, 54], a diﬀerent deﬁnition for that context had already appeared
in [52] and was widely cited [23, 8, 32, 30, 30]. This deﬁnition agrees with Deﬁnition 3.2 in the case of
hyperbolic exponential functions,6 but not in general. A third deﬁnition in the context of transcendental
functions appeared in [53, 42].

Deﬁnition 3.4. A compact set L ⊆ D is called hyperbolic (or expanding) if f (L) ⊆ L and there exists
n ∈ N such that |(f n)′(z)| > 1 for all z ∈ L. Note that since L is compact, this implies that inf{|(f n)′(z)| :
z ∈ L} > 1.

Deﬁnition 3.5. An inverse branch IFS of f is a conformal IFS whose elements are local analytic inverse
branches of (positive) iterates of f .

Deﬁnition 3.6. We deﬁne four numerical quantities associated with a meromorphic dynamical system:

6This claim is asserted in [1, p.1166] and can be proven as follows. If f is a hyperbolic exponential function, then by
deﬁnition, f has an attracting periodic cycle, and by [4, Theorem 7], 0 is in the attracting basin of this periodic cycle. So the
distance between Jf and the forward orbit of 0 is positive. If B ⊆ C is a ball disjoint from the forward orbit of 0, then for
all n ∈ N, every connected component of f −n(B) is isomorphic to B via f n. So a point z ∈ Jf is radial if and only if there
exists ε > 0 such that for inﬁnitely many n, Bs(f n(z), ε) is such a ball. This holds if and only if the sequence (f n(z))∞
1 does
not converge to ∞.

(1) dimconf (Jf ) is deﬁned to be the inﬁmum of the exponents of all locally ﬁnite conformal measures

supported on Jf . It is called the conformal dimension of Jf .

(2) dimdyn(Jf ) is deﬁned to be the supremum of the Hausdorﬀ dimensions of all f -invariant ergodic
probability measures µ on Jf with positive Lyapunov exponent7 that satisfy Supp(µ) ⊆ D. The
quantity dimdyn(Jf ) is called the dynamical dimension of Jf .

(3) dimhyp(Jf ) is deﬁned to be the supremum of the Hausdorﬀ dimensions of all hyperbolic subsets of

Jf . It is called the hyperbolic dimension of Jf .

(4) dimIFS(Jf ) is deﬁned to be the supremum of the Hausdorﬀ dimensions of all limit sets of ﬁnite

inverse branch IFSes of f . We call it the IFS dimension of Jf .

Remark 3.7. The measures appearing in the deﬁnition of the dynamical dimension, namely the f -invariant
ergodic measures µ satisfying Supp(µ) ⊆ D (i.e. µ is supported on a compact subset of D), are especially
transparent from a dynamical perspective. This is because if µ is such a measure and X = Supp(µ),
then we have f ∈ A(X) in the notation of [37, p.295], and so the results of [37, Chapter 11] apply. For
example, µ gives full measure to the radial limit set Jr(f ), as is seen by combining the ﬁrst assertion of [37,
Theorem 11.2.3] (i.e. existence of inverse branches for almost every point of the Rokhlin extension) with
Poincar´e’s recurrence theorem. Moreover, if µ has positive Lyapunov exponent, then it is exact dimensional
of dimension hµ(f )/χµ(f ), meaning that for µ-a.e. x ∈ D, the formula

(3.1)

lim inf

r→0

log µ(B(x, r))

log(r)

= dimH (µ) =

hµ(f )
χµ(f )

holds [37, Theorem 11.4.2]. Here hµ(f ) and χµ(f ) denote the entropy and Lyapunov exponent of the
measure µ, respectively. The formula (3.1) is known as the Volume Lemma. One can assume that µ has
positive entropy rather than positive Lyapunov exponent in the statement of the Volume Lemma, since by
Ruelle’s inequality [37, Theorem 11.1.1], the former implies the latter.

In the case of rational functions, the assumption Supp(µ) ⊆ D is trivially satisﬁed (since D = bC), so in

that case our deﬁnition agrees with the standard deﬁnition of dynamical dimension [50, 40, 47].

It is natural to ask whether the assumption Supp(µ) ⊆ D can be replaced by some integrability condition

on the measure µ, but we do not address this question here.

Remark 3.8. We make a few historical remarks about these deﬁnitions. The ﬁrst to appear was the
conformal dimension, which was never given a name but in [13], it was shown to be equal to the Hausdorﬀ
dimension of the Julia set in the case of expansive rational functions. Next was the dynamical dimension,
which was deﬁned in [14], where it was shown to be equal to the conformal dimension as well as to the
zero of a certain pressure function, this time in the case of arbitrary rational functions. Next was the
hyperbolic dimension, which in the context of rational functions was introduced independently in [41] and
[37] (the ﬁrst draft of the latter had been circulating since the mid ’90s), and was proven to equal the
dynamical dimension in [37, Theorem 12.3.11]. After that, McMullen [33] showed that the Hausdorﬀ
dimension of the radial Julia set of a rational function is equal to its hyperbolic dimension, and Rempe
[40] extended this result to transcendental functions. Finally, the IFS dimension has not been deﬁned
explicitly before now, but the proof of Rempe’s theorem shows that it is equal to the hyperbolic dimension
and the dimension of the radial Julia set. The following theorem extends Rempe’s result by showing that
the equality dimdyn(Jf ) = dimhyp(Jf ) and the inequality dimhyp(Jf ) ≤ dimconf (Jf ) can be extended to
the transcendental setting as well:

Theorem 3.9. If f : D → bC is a meromorphic dynamical system, then

dimdyn(Jf ) = dimhyp(Jf ) = dimH (Jr(f )) = dimIFS(Jf ) ≤ dimconf (Jf ).

(3.2)

The common number appearing in (3.2) will be denoted by δf and called the dynamically accessible di-
mension of Jf .

7The Lyapunov exponent of a measure µ is the number χµ

def

= R log |f ′| dµ.

9

Proof. As stated earlier, the proof of [40, Theorem 3.1] shows that

(3.3)

dimhyp(Jf ) = dimH (Jr(f )) = dimIFS(Jf ),

although this theorem only explicitly states that dimhyp(Jf ) = dimH (Jr(f )). Next, the inequality

(3.4)

dimdyn(Jf ) ≤ dimH (Jr(f ))

follows from the fact that any f -invariant ergodic probability measure µ on Jf of positive Lyapunov
exponent that satisﬁes Supp(µ) ⊆ D gives full measure to the radial limit set (see Remark 3.7). To
complete the proof, we need to prove the inequalities

(3.5)

(3.6)

dimhyp(Jf ) ≤ dimdyn(Jf ),
dimhyp(Jf ) ≤ dimconf (Jf ).

Let L ⊆ D be a hyperbolic set, and for each t ∈ R let P(t) denote the topological pressure of the
dynamical system f |L : L → L with respect to the potential function −t log |f ′|. Choose n large enough so
that inf L |(f n)′| > 1. For all t, u ≥ 0, we have

(3.7)

P(t) − u log sup
L

|f ′| ≤ P(t + u) ≤ P(t) − u

1
n

log inf
L

|(f n)′|.

In particular, P is continuous.

Since L ⊆ D is compact, the map f |L : L → L is of ﬁnite degree, so we have P(0) = htop(f |L) < ∞.
Combining with (3.7) gives limt→+∞ P(t) = −∞. On the other hand, P(0) = htop(f |L) ≥ 0, so by the
intermediate value theorem, P has a unique zero in the interval [0, ∞), which we will denote by h. A
standard argument in complex dynamics (cover L by ﬁnitely many small balls and then look at their
holomorphic univalent pull-backs to L of the same order; their diameters are comparable, by bounded
distortion, to moduli of derivatives) tells us that

Denote by µ an ergodic equilibrium state of the dynamical system f |L : L → L with respect to the potential
function −h log |f ′|. Such an equilbrium state exists because the system is expansive [37, Theorem 3.5.6].
By the deﬁnition of an equilibrium state, we have

dimH (L) ≤ h.

where χµ denotes the Lyapunov exponent of µ, i.e. χµ =R log |f ′| dµ. Since f |L : L → L is expanding, we

have χµ > 0. Therefore, by the Volume Lemma (see Remark 3.7), we have

hµ − hχµ = P(h) = 0,

dimH (L) ≤ h =

hµ
χµ

= dimH (µ) ≤ dimdyn(Jf ).

Taking the supremum over all such sets L thus proves (3.5).

Again let L ⊆ D be a hyperbolic set, and let µ be a locally ﬁnite s-conformal measure on Jf . Let n ∈ N
and ε > 0 be chosen so that |(f n)′(z)| > 1 for all z ∈ N (L, ε). Fix x ∈ L and r > 0, and let m ∈ N be the
largest number such that diam(f mn(B(x, r))) ≤ ε/2. By Koebe’s distortion theorem, f mn has bounded
distortion on B(x, r) and thus

µ(cid:0)B(x, r)(cid:1) ≍ rsµ(cid:0)f mn(B(x, r))(cid:1) ≍ rs.

[27, Theorem 8.2]) imply that dimH (L) ≤ s; taking the
Since x was arbitrary, standard results (e.g.
supremum over L and the inﬁmum over µ gives (3.6). Combining (3.3), (3.4), (3.5), and (3.6) completes
the proof.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.10. In the context of rational functions f it is known that equality holds in (3.2) (see [14,
Theorem 2.3] and [38, p.310, para. 2]), but in the realm of transcendental functions the situation is more
subtle, and it is not clear whether such a theorem is true. One case where equality is known to hold is the
class of dynamically regular functions of divergence type that were introduced and considered in detail in
[30, 31]. The fact that equality holds in this case follows from combining various theorems in [31], as we
now show:

10

TUSHAR DAS, LIOR FISHMAN, DAVID SIMMONS, AND MARIUSZ URBA ´NSKI

1. [31, Theorem 8.3] says that if f is dynamically regular of divergence type, then there exists τ0 < α2
such that for all τ0 < τ < α2, the pressure of the potential function φ(z) = −δf log |f ′|τ is zero,
where the notation is as in [31, (4.6)].

2. [31, Theorem 5.15(2)] says that if f is dynamically semi-regular and φ is tame, then there exists
a unique eP (φ)−φ-conformal probability measure. Note that the deﬁnition of “conformal” in [31,
Deﬁnition 5.10] is diﬀerent from our deﬁnition.

3. Since P (φ) = 0 as shown in step 1, this means the measure constructed in step 2 is e−φ-conformal,
which in our terminology means that it is δf -conformal with respect to the metric dτ . The measure
can be converted into a new measure conformal with respect to the Euclidean metric by multiplying
by the factor z 7→ |z|α2δf ; cf. [31, p.26]. The resulting measure is locally ﬁnite (on D = C) but not
necessarily ﬁnite.

4. If we can show that the function φ from step 1 is tame, then steps 1-3 show that if f is a dynamically
regular function of divergence type, then f has a locally ﬁnite δf -conformal measure (with respect
to the Euclidean metric). Comparing with the deﬁnition of tameness [31, Deﬁnition 5.1], we set
h ≡ 0 and t = δf , and we use the second displayed equation on [31, p.23] rather than the ﬁrst
displayed equation, since the second equation is what is actually used in the proofs.8 With these
settings, φ is tame if and only if δf > ρ/(α1 + α2). To prove that this is the case, we show that
δf > ρ/(α1 + τ ) > ρ/(α1 + α2). Now the ﬁrst inequality here follows from setting q = 0 in [31,
Lemma 8.2] (observing that T (0) = δf by [31, Theorem 8.3]), and the second inequality follows
from rearranging the inequality τ < α2.

Deﬁnition 3.11. We say that a meromorphic function f : D → bC is reducible if some relatively open

subset of Jf is contained in a real-analytic curve. We say that f is irreducible if it is not reducible.

Remark 3.12. It was shown by Bergweiler, Eremenko, and van Strien [3, 15] that a rational function is
irreducible if and only if its limit set is not contained in any generalized circle (i.e. either a circle or the
union of {∞} with a line). It is not clear whether the same holds for transcendental functions.

As in the case of inﬁnite IFSes, we prove the full dimension of BA2 in the radial Julia set of a meromorphic

dynamical system by constructing appropriate irreducible large-dimensional subsets:

Proposition 3.13. If f is irreducible, then

δf = sup{dimH (JS )},

where the supremum is taken over all ﬁnite irreducible inverse branch IFSes of f .

Proof. We show that by modifying slightly the proof of [40, Theorem 3.1], the inverse branch IFSes appear-
ing in that proof can be made to be irreducible. It suﬃces to consider the limit of these IFSes as N → ∞,
i.e. the inﬁnite IFS that consists of all the maps gj (j ∈ N) on [40, p.1418], since by Proposition 2.6(iii), if
this IFS is irreducible then its suﬃciently large ﬁnite subsystems are as well. Denote this IFS by S∞, and
note that Jr(D) ∩ D ⊆ Ns(JS∞ , δ), where the set Jr(D) and the parameter δ > 0 are as in [40, p.1417].

Claim 3.14. Jr(D) = Jf .

Proof. The set D was chosen so that dimH (Jr(D)) > d′, where d′ > 0 is as in [40, p.1417]. In particular,
Jr(D) is uncountable. On the other hand, as observed in [40, p.1417], Jr(D) can be written as the union
of a countable set and a backwards invariant set. Thus, there is some non-exceptional point z ∈ Jf whose
backwards orbit is contained in Jr(D). (We recall that a point is exceptional if its backwards orbit is ﬁnite.
By Picard’s theorem, there are at most two exceptional points.) By [4, Lemma 4], the backwards orbit of
z is dense in Jf . This completes the proof.
⊳

8In general one should be careful about “cohomologous” changes of potential such as the one on [31, p.23], since these
sometimes change the conformal measure by a factor which is not locally bounded. We don’t have to deal with this issue
because the arguments of [31] don’t actually use any cohomology between the functions φ and Φ in the second displayed
equation of [31, p.23], they just work directly with φ, which is the function that we can show is tame.

11

It follows from Claim 3.14 that Jf ∩ D ⊆ Jr(f ) ∩ D ⊆ Ns(JS∞ , δ). Since the IFS S∞ depends on the
parameter δ > 0 appearing in [40, p.1417], from now on we will write S∞ = S∞(δ). By contradiction,
suppose that for all suﬃciently small δ > 0, the IFS S∞ = S∞(δ) is reducible. Then by Proposition 2.6(ii),
for each such δ there is a conformal embedding ψ = ψδ : D → C such that JS∞ ⊆ ψ−1

δ (R). So

Jf ∩ D ⊆ Ns(ψ−1

δ (R), δ).

As before, we can without loss of generality assume that ψδ(p) = 0 and |ψ′
δ(p)| = 1, where p ∈ D is a
distinguished point. Note that since δ is chosen after D in the proof of [40, Theorem 3.1], the maps (ψδ)δ
all have the same domain. Thus (ψδ)δ is a normal family, and if ψ denotes one of its limits as δ → 0, then
Jf ∩ D ⊆ ψ−1(R). Thus f is reducible, a contradiction.
(cid:3)

As an immediate consequence of Corollary 1.6 and Proposition 3.13 (see also Theorem 3.9), we get the
following:

Theorem 3.15. If f : D → bC is an irreducible meromorphic dynamical system, then BA2 has full dimen-

sion in Jr(f ):

(3.8)

dimH (BA2 ∩ Jf ) ≥ dimH (BA2 ∩ Jr(f )) = dimH (Jr(f )) = δf .

Note in particular that Theorem 3.15 applies to all those functions whose dynamically accessible dimen-
sion is strictly greater than 1, since such functions are irreducible. For example, by [52, Theorems 2.1 and
4.5], we have dimH (Jr(f )) > 1 for every function f of the form f (z) = λez, λ ∈ C \ {0}. Combining with
Theorem 3.15 yields:

then (3.8) holds.

the orders of the poles of f . It has been proved in [21] that dimH (Jf ) > 2qf
showed that dimH (Jr(f )) > 2qf

Corollary 3.16. If λ ∈ C \ {0} and f : C → bC is the entire function given by the formula f (z) = λez,
For each nonconstant elliptic (i.e. doubly periodic) function f : C → bC, let qf ≥ 1 be the maximum of
non-recurrent elliptic function f : C → bC. Therefore, as an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.15, we
Corollary 3.17. If f : C → bC is a nonconstant elliptic function, then

qf +1 ≥ 1, and in fact the proof
qf +1 ≥ 1. Moreover, it has been proved in [22] that δf = dimH (Jf ) for each

dimH (BA2 ∩ Jf ) ≥ dimH (BA2 ∩ Jr(f )) = δf >

get the following:

2qf

qf + 1

≥ 1.

If in addition f is non-recurrent, then

dimH (BA2 ∩ Jf ) = dimH (Jf ) = δf .

It was proven in [36] that for any rational function f : bC → bC that is a topological Collet–Eckmann map

(one of a variety of equivalent deﬁnitions of such maps is that the diameters of connected components
of inverse images of small balls converge to zero exponentially fast9), we have δf = dimH (Jf ). On the
other hand, it was proven in [48, Proposition 6.1] that for any rational function which is non-recurrent
(i.e. there are no recurrent critical points in its Julia set), the set Jf \ Jr(f ) is countable, and in particular
δf = dimH (Jf ). We therefore obtain the following:

Corollary 3.18. If f : bC → bC is an irreducible rational function which is either topological Collet–Eckmann

or non-recurrent, then

dimH (BA2 ∩ Jf ) = dimH (Jf ) = δf .

Remark. The class of non-recurrent rational maps contains the classes of semi-hyperbolic, sub-hyperbolic,
and expansive (i.e. hyperbolic or parabolic) rational functions. This fact follows from well-known equivalent
formulations of the deﬁnitions of these classes; see [7, Theorem 2.1], [6, Theorem V.3.1], and [50, Theorem
3.1], respectively. Therefore, Corollary 3.18 applies to all of those classes.

9Further characterizations of topological Collet–Eckmann maps and their fundamental properties can be found in [36, 39]

and the references therein.

Appendix A. Semi-hyperbolic rational functions, hyperplane diffuseness, and absolute

decay

In Theorem 3.15 (resp. Corollary 3.18), we proved that the set of badly approximable vectors has full
dimension in the radial Julia set (resp. total Julia set) of any rational function (resp. any topological Collet–
Eckmann or non-recurrent rational function). To some extent, this theorem make results like Theorem 1.5
obsolete: a main motivation for Theorem 1.5 was to prove the full dimension of BA2 for hyperbolic rational
functions via Theorem 1.1, but we now have another way to prove this using much weaker assumptions
than hyperbolicity. A similar situation exists regarding the other main motivation for Theorem 1.5, namely
extremality; cf.
[10, Theorem 1.18] and the surrounding discussion. Nevertheless, Theorem 1.5 is still
interesting from a geometrical point of view. In this appendix we prove that Theorem 1.5 can be generalized
to a class of functions which is much broader than the class of hyperbolic rational functions, while still
being smaller than the classes of non-recurrent and topological Collet–Eckman rational functions. This is
the class of semi-hyperbolic rational functions:

D ∈ N such that for all x ∈ Jf and n ∈ N, the topological degree of f n ↿ f −n(Bs(x, ε))x is at most D.
Here Ux denotes the connected component of U that contains x.

Deﬁnition A.1 ([7, p.5]). A rational function f : bC → bC is called semi-hyperbolic if there exist ε > 0 and
Theorem A.2. Let f : bC → bC be an irreducible semi-hyperbolic rational function, and let δ be the

dynamically accessible dimension of f . Then the δ-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure restricted to Jf is
absolutely friendly and Ahlfors regular of dimension δ.

We will prove Theorem A.2 via lemmas. In the process, we will provide a new technique for proving
that measures are absolutely friendly. This technique can be used to answer a question raised in [5] (see
Remark A.7 below).

Lemma A.3. Let U1, U2 be simply connected domains and let f : U1 → U2 be a proper holomorphic map
of degree D (i.e. each point of U2 has exactly D preimages counting multiplicity). Fix C1 > 0. Then there
exists C2 > 0, depending only on D and C1, such that if K2 ⊆ U2 is a compact set with hyperbolic diameter
≤ C1 (with respect to the hyperbolic metric of U2), and K1 ⊆ U1 is a connected component of f −1(K2),
then

(i) the hyperbolic diameter of K1 with respect to the hyperbolic metric of U1 is ≤ C2; and
(ii) there exists a constant λ > 0 such that for all x ∈ K1,

(A.1)

|f ′(x)| ≍C2 λ

D−1Yi=1

|x − ai|,

where (ai)D−1

is a list of the critical points of f , counting multiplicity.

Proof. By the Riemann mapping theorem, it suﬃces to prove each part for a single pair of sets (U1, U2).
(To prove that this reduction is valid for part (ii), use part (i) and Koebe’s distortion theorem.) We prove
(i) with U1 = U2 = B (the unit ball) and (ii) with U1 = U2 = H (the upper half-plane).

Let U1 = U2 = B, and without loss of generality suppose that 0 ∈ K2. Then K2 ⊆ B(0, C1.1), where
C1.1 < 1 is chosen so that dB(0, C1.1) = C1. Here and from now on dB denotes distance taken with respect
to the hyperbolic metric of B. Since f : B → B is proper of degree D, we can write f as a Blaschke product

f (x) =

where b1, . . . , bD ∈ B(0, 1) are the zeros of f counting multiplicity, and the second factor is omitted if

in which case the hyperbolic distance from x to bi is at most C1.2
and thus since K1 is connected, diamB(K1) ≤ C2

1.1 ). So K1 ⊆SD

def= 2DC1.2, which completes the proof of (i).

i=1 BB(bi, C1.2)

Now let U1 = U2 = H, and without loss of generality suppose that f (∞) = ∞. Then f is a real
polynomial of degree D, and (A.1) holds with equality (where λ is the leading coeﬃcient of f ). This
completes the proof of (ii).
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition A.4 ([5, Deﬁnition 4.2]). A closed set J ⊆ Rd is hyperplane diﬀuse if there exists γ > 0 such
that for all x ∈ J and 0 < r ≤ 1, and for every aﬃne hyperplane L ⊆ Rd, we have

J ∩ B(x, r) \ N (L, γr) 6= (cid:31).

Lemma A.5. Let f : bC → bC be an irreducible semi-hyperbolic rational function. Then Jf is hyperplane

diﬀuse.

Proof. Suppose that f is semi-hyperbolic but Jf is not hyperplane diﬀuse, and we will show that f is
reducible. For each k ∈ N, let p = pk ∈ C, r = rk ∈ (0, 1], and an aﬃne hyperplane L = Lk ⊆ C be
chosen so that Jf ∩ Be(pk, rk) ⊆ Ne(Lk, rk/k). Let B = Bk = Be(pk, rk), and let n = nk be the largest
number such that diams(f n(B)) ≤ ε/2, where ε > 0 is as in Deﬁnition A.1. Let K2 = Bs(f n(p), ε/2),
U2 = Bs(f n(p), ε), K1 = f −n(K2)p, and U1 = f −n(U2)p. By Deﬁnition A.1, the degree Dk of the proper
holomorphic map f n : U1 → U2 is ≤ D, so by Lemma A.3, there exists λ = λk > 0 such that for all
x ∈ B ⊆ K1,

|(f n)′(x)|e→s ≍ λ

Dk−1Yi=1

|x − ai|,

where a1, . . . , aDk−1 are the critical points of f n ↿ U1. Here the notation | · |e→s means that the derivative
is taken with respect to the Euclidean metric in the domain but the spherical metric in the codomain.

Now let the isomorphism g = gk : B
i let bi = g−1(ai). Then for all x ∈ B,

def= B(0, 1) → B be given by the formula g(x) = p + rx, and for each

|(f n ◦ g)′(x)|e→s ≍ λrDk

Let hk = f nk ◦ gk. Since diams(hk(B)) ≤ ε/2 for all k, (hk)∞

For each k let eLk = g−1
k (Lk). Then Jf ∩ hk(B) ⊆ hk(Ne(eLk, 1/k)). Taking the limit along a subsequence
as k → ∞, we get Jf ∩ h(B) ⊆ h(eL), where eLk 99K eL. Since Jf ∋ f nk (pk) = hk(0) 99K h(0), we have

Jf ∩ h(B) 6= (cid:31) and thus we have constructed a nonempty relatively open subset of Jf contained in the real-
analytic image of a line segment. Since such a set can be written as the union of ﬁnitely many real-analytic
curves, this show that f is reducible, completing the proof.
(cid:3)

Lemma A.6. Any doubling measure whose topological support is hyperplane diﬀuse is absolutely decaying.

Remark A.7. Incidentally, Lemma A.6 resolves a question of Broderick, Kleinbock, Reich, Weiss, and
the second-named author [5, p.14]: “Let K be a hyperplane diﬀuse subset of Rd. Whether or not it is
possible to construct an absolutely decaying measure µ with Supp µ = K is an open question.” Indeed,
since subsets of Rd are automatically doubling as metric spaces, the main result of [24] implies that they
support doubling measures, and Lemma A.6 implies that these measures are absolutely decaying if the set
in question is hyperplane diﬀuse.

14

TUSHAR DAS, LIOR FISHMAN, DAVID SIMMONS, AND MARIUSZ URBA ´NSKI

Proof of Lemma A.6. Indeed, let µ be such a measure, and let J be the topological support of µ. Let γ > 0
be as in Deﬁnition A.4.

Claim A.8. Let p ∈ J be any point, and let L be any aﬃne hyperplane. Fix 0 < r < R < 1, and let

diﬀuse, we have

1 be a maximal 4r-separated sequence in S1 ∩ J. Fix i = 1, . . . , N . Since J is hyperplane

let yi be any member of this set. We observe that

J ∩ B(xi, r) \ N (L, γr) 6= (cid:31);

and on the other hand

B(yi, γr/2) ⊆ B(xi, 2r) ⊆ S2

B(yi, γr/2) ∩ S1 = (cid:31)

and so, since the balls B(xi, 2r) (i = 1, . . . , N ) are disjoint, we have

µ(S2 \ S1) ≥

NXi=1

µ(B(yi, γr/2)) ≍

NXi=1

µ(B(xi, 4r)) ≥ µ(S1).

(The asymptotic holds since µ is doubling.) Rearranging yields (A.2).

Iterating n times yields the following corollary:

Corollary A.9. Let p ∈ J be any point, and let L be any aﬃne hyperplane. Fix 0 < r < R < 1 and
n ∈ N, and let

S1 = B(p, R) ∩ N (L, r)

S2 = B

p, R +

where K = 2(γ + 2)/γ > 1. Then

(A.3)

µ(S1) ≤ (1 − ε)nµ(S2).

To show that µ is absolutely decaying, let B = B(p, R) be any ball, let L be any aﬃne hyperplane, and ﬁx
β > 0. Let n be the largest integer such that K n < 1/β, and let r = βR and α = − log(1 − ε)/ log(K) > 0.
Then

where C is the implied constant of (A.4). Thus µ is absolutely decaying.

Proof of Theorem A.2. By [7, Theorem 2.1], a semi-hyperbolic function has no recurrent critical points or
parabolic points in its Julia set. So by [48, Theorem 1.1], the Hausdorﬀ measure of Jf in dimension δf is
positive and ﬁnite. Actually, a closer inspection of the proof of [48, Theorem 1.1] shows that the Hausdorﬀ
δ-dimensional measure on Jf , which we will denote by µ, is Ahlfors δ-regular (simply skip the steps in the
proofs of [48, Lemma 7.12 and Lemma 7.13] where [48, Theorems 2.1(2) and 2.2(2)] are used, yielding that
the conformal measure is Ahlfors δ-regular). Its support, Jf , is hyperplane diﬀuse by Lemma A.5, so by
Lemma A.6, µ is absolutely decaying.
