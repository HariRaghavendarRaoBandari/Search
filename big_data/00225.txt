The calculation of the equilibrium optical properties of bulk silicon by using the Bethe–Salpeter
equation solved in the Kohn–Sham basis represents a cornerstone in the development of an ab–
initio approach to the optical and electronic properties of materials. Nevertheless calculations of
the transient optical spectrum using the same eﬃcient and successful scheme are scarce. We report,
here, a joint theoretical and experimental study of the transient reﬂectivity spectrum of bulk sili-
con. Femtosecond transient reﬂectivity is compared to a parameter–free calculation based on the
non–equilibrium Bethe–Salpeter equation. By providing an accurate description of the experimen-
tal results we disclose the diﬀerent phenomena that determine the transient optical response of a
semiconductor. We give a parameter–free interpretation of concepts like bleaching, photo–induced
absorption and stimulated emission, beyond the Fermi golden rule. We also introduce the concept
of optical gap renormalization, as a generalization of the known mechanism of band gap renormal-
ization. The present scheme successfully describes the case of bulk silicon, showing its universality
and accuracy.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding the electronic and optical properties of
molecules and solids requires knowledge of their structure
and their dynamics. Structural information describes the
time-independent relative arrangement of the atoms in
the system and links their physical properties to their
spatial location at equilibrium. Dynamics describes how
the system responds to external stimuli and evolves from
one conﬁguration to the other when driven in the non–
equilibrium (NEQ) regime. Many dynamical processes,
involving for example the motion of atoms or charge car-
riers occur on very short time-scales, ranging from 10−14
to 10−12 s.
Informations on such ultrafast events can
be gained by ultrafast optical spectroscopy1, a technique
which investigates time–dependent variations of the op-
tical properties of a system under the eﬀect of an ultra-
short light pulse excitation. Since the availability of fem-
tosecond laser pulses in the early 80s, there has been an
enormous progress in this ﬁeld. In particular some key
technological advances in the 90s, such as mode-locked
Ti:sapphire lasers, chirped pulse ampliﬁcation2 and op-
tical parametric ampliﬁers3 have greatly improved the
stability and reliability of ultrafast laser systems, mak-
ing femtosecond spectroscopy available to a broad com-
munity of non-specialist users.

Several experimental methods have been developed for
solids, starting from the simple pump-probe, which al-
lows to measure photoinduced population dynamics by
monitoring the time-dependent transmission or reﬂectiv-
ity of the sample with time resolution down to a few
light cycles4,5. Technical advances have enabled more
sophisticated techniques, from photon echo6 and two-

dimensional7 spectroscopies, which measure the polariza-
tion dephasing times and the correlations between photo–
excitations, to time- and angle–resolved photo–electron
spectroscopy8, tracking time- and momentum-dependent
electron energy distributions9, to time-resolved T Hz
spectroscopy10, which monitors the non-equilibrium
evolution of charge carriers and low-energy excita-
tions11. Extensive experiments have been performed
on bulk and nanostructured semiconductors12, supercon-
ductors13 and other strongly correlated materials14.

The situation from the theoretical and computational
Indeed, the modeling
point of view is rather diﬀerent.
of equilibrium and out–of–equilibrium materials has fol-
lowed several distinct and often fragmented and uncor-
related paths. The most up–to–date scheme to calcu-
late and predict the equilibrium ground– and excited–
state properties of a wide range of materials is based
on the merging of Density–Functional–Theory15 (DFT),
with Many–Body Perturbation Theory16 (MBPT). Such
approach is often referred to as ab-initio Many-Body
Perturbation Theory16 (ai–MBPT). Within ai–MBPT,
DFT provides a suitable single–particle basis for the
MBPT scheme. This methods has been applied success-
fully, for example, to correct the well–known band–gap
underestimation problem of DFT17,18, and to calculate
the optical properties of an impressive range of materi-
als16.

The ai–MBPT has been constantly developed in the
last decades leading to a solid framework. Already in
the seminal work of Hanke and Sham19,
it was clear
that only by properly including the combined eﬀect of
the screened electron–electron and electron–hole inter-
actions, it is possible to correctly interpret the equilib-

rium absorption spectrum of extended systems in terms
of excitonic states. The electron–electron interaction
is included in the computation of the quasi–particles
(QP) band structure by means of the GW approxima-
tion, while the electron–hole interaction is included in
the computation of the neutral excitations by means of
the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE). Therefore, as far as
equilibrium properties are concerned, a number of well
established standards and codes are available to describe
the experimental absorption spectra.

The situation in the out–of–equilibrium case is rather
diﬀerent. The NEQ Green function theory20–22, i.e. the
NEQ version of MBPT, has only be used to simulate the
non-equilibrium response of simple ideal materials23–27
while, for more realistic materials, semi–empirical meth-
ods based on the semiconductor Bloch equations28–30 and
semi–classical Boltzmann equation31 have been adopted.
As a consequence, while the absorption spectrum of bulk
silicon, for example, is well understood16,19,32–34, its NEQ
behavior is not. It is then clear that there is a gap be-
tween the experimental and computational approaches.
The problem is, how to export to the transient case the
same level of accuracy and predictivity gained in the equi-
librium limit by extending both the BSE and the GW
approximation out–of–equilibrium.

Only very recently a series of works have devised a
formal extensions of ai–MBPT to the diﬀerent aspects
of the NEQ regime: the interaction with a laser pulse
and the description of excitons in a real–time fashion35,
the introduction, ab–initio, of the electron–phonon and
electron–electron scatterings in the carrier dynamics36,37,
the introduction of the NEQ Bethe–Salpeter equation38,
the derivation of a coherent and complete extension of
Hedin’s equations to the out–of–equilibrium dynamics of
electrons, phonons and photons39 using the Kohn–Sham
basis. These methods have been applied successfully to
study carrier dynamics40–43 and transient absorption44
in paradigmatic materials.

However,

the ab–initio way to describe out–of–
equilibrium properties is just moving the ﬁrst steps and,
as a consequence, it represents a rapidly changing sce-
nario. A winning scheme to get a real benchmark for
theories and approximations is to perform combined
theoretical and experimental studies where the simula-
tions are on–the–ﬂy compared with the measured quan-
tities. Indeed the ultrafast dynamics of semiconductors,
largely explored by spectroscopic measurements in the
last decades, are among the ﬁrst cases studied theoret-
ically and provided an excellent test–bed for the earlier
development of the theory.

In this work bulk silicon is used as a natural test–bed to
the further development and validation of the ai–MBPT
in the NEQ regime. We will perform Transient Reﬂec-
tion (TR) measurements, in which the system is excited
by an ultrashort laser pulse, and its subsequent tempo-
ral evolution is measured by detecting the reﬂection of
a delayed broadband probe pulse. We will compare the
measured out-of-equilibrium behavior of bulk silicon af-

2

ter photoexcitation with state–of–the–art simulations. In
order to simplify the analysis, we will pump the system
at photon energies close to the optical gap. In addition,
we will work in the low density regime23, where the eﬀect
of the pump pulse can be described in terms of electrons
jumping from the occupied to the unoccupied orbitals
with (small) variation of the electronic population.

By comparing the simulations with the experiment,
we will show that ai–MBPT in the NEQ regime is able
to give a clear and complete description of the non–
equilibrium optical properties of bulk silicon. We will
give a formal deﬁnition of bleaching, photo–induced ab-
sorption and stimulated emission. This will make possi-
ble to associate these concepts, which otherwise can be
hardly identiﬁed in the spectrum of extended systems,
to speciﬁc features of the experimental signal. Moreover
we will introduce the concept of optical–gap renormal-
ization, as a generalization of the well known concept of
band–gap renormalization. The latter is a variation of
the band structure of the system induced by the renor-
malization of the electron–electron interaction. The for-
mer, which is also a consequence of the band–gap renor-
malization, is additionally inﬂuenced by the renormaliza-
tion of the electron–hole interaction.

The transient reﬂectivity spectrum of silicon will be
described in terms of the sum of two eﬀects: (i) a bleach-
ing of the ﬁrst absorption peak plus (ii) a shift in the
position and a reduction in intensity of the same peak
due to the optical–gap renormalization. The bleaching
will give a reduction of the reﬂectivity and thus will de-
scribe the negative signal in the low energy part of the
spectrum. On the other hand the optical gap renormal-
ization will describe the main feature in the experimental
signal around 3.3 eV .

The structure of the paper is as follows. Sec. II presents
the equilibrium simulations introducing key concepts like
the GW approximation and the Bethe–Salpeter equation.
In Sec. III we will introduce the NEQ optical properties
of bulk silicon. The experimental technique and results
will be presented in sec. III A. The theoretical method
and the results of the simulations will be discussed in the
subsequent sections as follow. In sec. III B the modeling
of the pump pulse and the creation of the NEQ popula-
tion will be presented. In sec. III C we will introduce a
formal deﬁnition of bleaching, photo–induced absorption
and stimulated emission resulting from the NEQ popu-
lation. In sec. III D we will deﬁne the optical gap renor-
malization. Finally in sec. III E we will give the complete
description of the experimental TR signal of silicon using
the concepts introduced in the previous sections.

II. EQUILIBRIUM PROPERTIES

Bulk silicon is a prototype semiconductor whose op-
tical properties have been extensively studied both from
the experimental32,45 and the theoretical side16,19,33,34,46.
Here we start by describing its equilibrium electronic and

optical properties showing that the ai–MBPT approach
successfully describes the experimental results.

We start from a density–functional theory (DFT) cal-
culation47. Then we apply MBPT to obtain the QP
energies within the GW approximation48,49 and the ab-
sorption spectra from the solution of the BSE16. The
QP band structure will show the eﬀect of the screened
electron–electron interaction, while the absorption spec-
trum within the BSE accounts for the eﬀect of the
electron–hole interaction.

The calculations of the equilibrium optical and elec-
tronic properties represents a necessary basis for the
NEQ simulations described in the next section.

A. Quasi–particles and the electron–electron

interaction

The Kohn–Sham (KS) ground–state50 is computed,
within the local density approximation51, by using the
PWSCF code52. The parameters for the calculations are
a 4x4x4 sampling k–grid of the Brillouin zone, corre-
sponding to a total of 64 kpoints, with an energy cut–oﬀ
of 20 Ry for the representation of the wave–functions
in reciprocal space. The crystal structure is relaxed to
its lowest energy and equilibrium conﬁguration and norm
conserving pseudo–potentials are used to describe the 1s,
2s and 2p electrons, which are kept frozen in the core.
Two atoms are present in the unit cell and thus there
are in total 4 occupied bands in the ground–state with 8
electrons per unit cell, for which the KS wave–functions,
ψKS, and eigen–values, ˜ǫKS, are obtained.

In order to simplify the notation we represent in the

following as ˜O a quantity O evaluated at equilibrium.

MBPT corrections are then computed using the YAMBO
code53. The QP energies ˜ǫnk are deﬁned, starting from
the KS energies, via the QP equation

˜ǫnk = ˜ǫKS

nk + hnk| ˜ΣGW (˜ǫnk) − ˜V xc|nki,

(1)

where nk are indexes for the band (n) and the k–
point (k), x is a spatial coordinate and ω is a frequency.
hnk| ˜ΣGW (˜ǫnk)|nki is spatial average of the standard GW
self–energy48,49 ˜ΣGW (x, x′; ω) evaluated at ω = ǫnk.
Similarly hnk| ˜V xc|nki is the average of ˜V xc(x)δ(x − x′),
the exchange–correlation potential used to compute the
DFT ground–state.

Eq. 1 is solved on a 16x16x16 k–grid in the Brillouin
zone, with the KS wave–functions and energies com-
puted from a non–self consistent DFT calculation start-
ing from a 4x4x4 k–grid.

The GW self–energy

˜ΣGW (x, x′; ω) = Z d3k

is constructed starting from the KS Green function G
and the screened electron–electron interaction ˜W . Here
x = R+r with r inside the unit cell and R the coordinate
which identiﬁes the position of each unit cell in the whole
space.

The KS Green function has the form

˜Gk(r, r′; ω) = 2Xn (cid:0)ψKS

with ˜fnk the equilibrium occupation factors. The prefac-
tor 2 is due to spin degeneracies since we are considering
a non polarized system. The sum over n is performed
considering 50 bands.

The screened electron–electron interaction is:

˜WGG′ (q, ω) = 4π XGG′

˜ε−1
GG′(q, ω)

|q + G| |q + G′|

Ω = 8π3/V with V the volume of the unit cell. We use
the microscopic random–phase approximation (RPA) for
the screening

whose G = G′ = q = 0 component is deﬁned via the
limq→0. χRP A is obtained solving the Dyson equation
for the response function

(7)

In Eqs. 2-7 we used 59 G-vectors (which correspond to a
kinetic energy of 4.6 Ry) and thus 59 r-vectors in Eq. 5.
Eq. 7 is solved in the static case ω = 0 and for the energy
w = 27.2 eV , the frequency dependence of W (ω) is then
obtained via a plasmon pole model54.

The KS response function can be constructed from
the KS wave–functions and energies. Here we deﬁne the
oscillator strengths as

The response function has contribution only from the
transitions for which ˜flq 6= 0, corresponding to a pair
composed by an occupied nk and an empty level mk + q
in the ground state. We label this group of transitions as
˜Ψq. Thus at equilibrium we have the condition ˜flq 6= 0
if {l ∈ ˜Ψq}.

In Fig. 1.a the KS band structure of silicon is com-
pared with the QP one. Both band structures are ob-
tained with an interpolation from the regular 16x16x16
grid to the L-Γ-X high symmetry lines. In Fig. 1.b in-
stead the diﬀerence ǫnk−ǫKS
nk is represented. In both pan-
els we can appreciate the two principal eﬀects induced by
the QP corrections in semiconductors, i.e. (i) the opening
of the KS band gap and (ii) a stretching of the bands.
In particular the indirect gap is lifted from 0.5 eV to
1.16 eV while the direct gap from 2.57 eV to 3.43 eV .
The experimental values are 1.17 eV and about 3.4 eV
respectively55. Those values are in excellent agreement
with the results of previous calculations56.

B. Optical properties and the electron–hole

interaction

Excitonic eﬀects are a characteristic feature of the ab-
sorption spectra of semiconductors. A well estabilished
theoretical scheme suitable to describe these eﬀects is
the BSE16, a non linear equation for the four point re-
sponse function, or electron–hole propagator, ˜LBSE(ω).
Absorption is deﬁned in the q → 0 limit of the response
function. For simplicity we will thus drop the q = 0 in
the notation for energies, occupation factors and transi-
tions space by deﬁning ˜fl ≡ ˜fl,0, ˜ǫl ≡ ˜ǫl,0 and ˜Ψ ≡ ˜Ψ0.

We start by rewriting the BSE in a form where the

occupation factors appear explicitly:

˜LBSE

ll′ (ω)+

˜LQP

ls (ω) q ˜fshvss′ − ˜Wss′iq ˜f ′

s

˜LBSE

s′l′ (ω).

(14)

In Eq. 14 ˜LQP is identical to ˜LKS but for the replacement
˜ǫKS
nk → ˜ǫnk. A summation over the ss′ indexes is implicit.
Moreover we have deﬁned

˜Wss′ ≡ XGG′
vss′ ≡ XG6=0

ρnn′k,G(q) ˜WGG′ (q, 0)ρmm′k,G′(q), (15)

ρnmk,G(q) vG(q) ρn′m′k,G(q).

(16)

vG(q) = 4π/|q + G|2 is the bare Coulomb interaction,
whose G = 0 component is not included. ˜WGG′(q, ω = 0)
is the static approximation to the screened interaction. It
is computed with the same parameters used for electron–
electron interaction entering the GW self–energy. Here
it describes the direct interaction between the electron
and the hole.

Introducing the macroscopic residuals:

˜Rl = lim

q→0(cid:16) ρl,0(q)

q

(cid:17)q ˜fl,

(17)

the equation can be re-cast in the form of an excitonic
hamiltonian as

˜Hll′ = ˜ǫl −q ˜fl(cid:16)vll′ − ˜W s

ll′(cid:17)q ˜fl′,

(18)

where we considered, for the index l = {nmk} again a
16x16x16 k–grid sampling of the Brillouin zone, 3 oc-
cupied states in conduction and 3 unoccupied states in

valence band. The symmetrization via q ˜fl, already re-

ported in the literature57, ensures that the matrix re-
mains pseudo–Hermitian58,59 also in presence of frac-
tional occupations. ˜H can then be diagonalized, moving
from the electron–hole space l to the excitonic space λ.

that, thanks to the introduction of the imaginary term

or ˜LQP
λλ′ ) are compared with the results from eq. (22)
and with experimental data. The comparison between
the KS, the QP and the BSE reﬂectivity underlines the
twofold role played by the screened interaction. On one
hand the screened electron–electron interaction, included
in the self–energy, opens the electronic band gap, shifting
the main peak in the reﬂectivity from about 2.8 eV to

The optical absorption is also shown in the inset.

about 3.5 eV . This is the eﬀect of the QP corrections
which we have already discussed in the previous section.
On the other hand the screened electron–hole interac-
tion, which is described by the kernel of the BSE matrix,
closes the optical gap back to about 3.4 eV . The BSE
results are in very good agreement with experiments, for
what concerns reﬂectivity and absorption.

The electronic gap opening can only be described via
the long range electron–electron interaction W . It cannot
be captured by the LDA V xc, which, instead, is local
in space. Similarly the red shift of the optical gap and
the corresponding rise of the reﬂectivity intensity from
the QP to the BSE spectrum can be captured only via
the long range electron–hole interaction. It has indeed
been extensively discussed in the literature61,62 that a
kernel local in space, such as the adiabatic local–density
approximation, is not able to capture excitonic eﬀects.

In the NEQ section we will show how the modiﬁcation
of both the electron–electron and of the electron–hole in-
teractions will aﬀect the QP states and the BSE poles.
We will thus introduce the concept of optical gap renor-
malization that, as a generalization of the well known
concept of band gap renormalization, will be essential to
correctly describe the experimental TR signal.

III. NON–EQUILIBRIUM OPTICAL

PROPERTIES

In this section we describe the diﬀerent aspects of the
NEQ simulations and the experimental setup. The ex-
perimental data is presented in Section III A where the
transient reﬂectivity (TR) is measured as a function of
the probe frequency ω and of the pump–probe delay τ .

projected onto the KS wave–functions.

In Sections III C-III E the interaction with the probe
will be described within the linear response regime. Since
the system is now out of equilibrium, this corresponds to
compute the NEQ dielectric function, ε(ω, τ ).

As a direct consequence of the deﬁnition and calcula-
tion of ε(ω, τ ) it will be possible, in Section III C, to in-
troduce the formal deﬁnition of bleaching, photo–induced
absorption and stimulated emission, beyond the IP ap-
proximation. In Section III D the diﬀerent components
of the optical gap renormalization induced by the pump
pulse will be described. Finally in Section III E these
eﬀects will be considered together to describe the TR
experimental signal.

A. Experimental transient reﬂectivity in bulk

silicon

One basic technique for time-resolved optical spec-
troscopy is pump–probe, in which a ﬁrst ultrashort laser
pulse (the pump) excites the system. The whole ensemble
of electrons and atoms is thus excited from the ground
and unperturbed state to a time–dependent and com-
plex conﬁguration. At this point all physical properties
(including the change in the optical absorption and re-
ﬂection) are dictated by the dynamics of this ensemble,
the evolution of which are monitored by a delayed pertur-
bative laser pulse (the probe). This is used to measure a
wealth of time–dependent observables63,64 of which tran-
sient reﬂection (TR) is one of the most relevant.

The temporal resolution of the experiment is deter-
In

mined by the duration of pump and probe pulses.

addition, the need to excite a system on resonance and
probe optical transitions occurring at diﬀerent frequen-
cies requires tunability of the pump pulse, whereas the
simultaneous measurement of transmission changes at
many diﬀerent wavelengths calls for a broadband probe.
The pump–probe setup is powered by a regenera-
tively ampliﬁed Ti:sapphire laser system (Quantronix
model Integra-C). The laser source delivers light pulses
at ≈ 1.55 eV (800 nm) with duration of 120 f s and at
a repetition rate of 1kHz. A fraction of the source is
frequency doubled to provide pump pulses at ≈ 3.1 eV
(400 nm) with duration of 100 f s and a total energy
which ranges between 12 and 200 nJ. The pump pulse
frequency is close to the optical gap of silicon, and the
thermal broadening of the absorption spectra (see Fig. 2)
allows a direct injection of the photo–excited electronic
carriers from the top of the valence band to the conduc-
tion band, around the center of the Brillouin zone (Γ
point). Another replica of the fundamental source beam
is focused on a 2 mm-thick CaF2 crystal, where self-
phase modulation generates an ultrabroad white light
continuum with spectrum ranging between 1.7 eV and
3.5 eV , acting as a probe. The pump and probe pulses
are delayed by a high precision delay line and collinearly
focused on the sample. The pump laser spot diameter
is estimated to be ∼ 150 µm which corresponds to a ﬂu-
ence of ≈ 1.13mJ/cm2 at an energy of 200 nJ. The probe
spot diameter is about half that of the pump. The TR
signal, i.e. the relative variation of the reﬂectivity from
the equilibrium, is obtained by measuring, at single-shot
rate, the reﬂected probe spectra with (R(ω, τ )) and with-
out ( ˜R(ω)) the pump excitation at several pump–probe
delays τ 65 and calculating:

∆R (ω, τ )

˜R (ω)

=

R(ω, τ ) − ˜R(ω)

˜R(ω)

(25)

The ultrabroad spectrum of the white light continuum
and the unique single-shot spectrometer allows to simul-
taneously probe the evolution of the system over an un-
precedentedly broad frequency range.

Figure 3 shows the measured ∆R/ ˜R spectrum at a
delay time of 200 f s, i.e. when the relative variation of
the signal is maximum.

The optical response has been explored in a wide range
of pump ﬂuencies showing a linear behavior within the
entire range of probe photon energies as reported in
the inset of Fig. 3. The ∆R/ ˜R spectrum is dominated
by a pronounced narrow negative peak centered around
3.3 eV . The low energy side of the peak displays in-
teresting features at energies lower than the optical gap:
between 2.9 eV and 3.2 eV the signal becomes positive
while below 2.9 eV down to the near-IR optical region is
completely negative. In the reﬂection geometry it is not
easy to directly associate these features to clear physi-
cal eﬀects, since both the real and the imaginary part
of the dielectric function ε(ω, τ ) enters the deﬁnition of
the reﬂectivity. The negative peak could be related to
the Pauli blocking of the optical transition (or bleaching

eﬀect), resonant to the gap. The negative signal, below
the optical gap, could be instead assigned to a variation
of the Re[ε(ω, τ )]. Indeed Im[ε(ω, τ )] below the optical
gap, and its variation, could be related to transient state
ﬁlling eﬀects involving phonon or defect mediated optical
transitions and is expected to be some order of magni-
tude smaller.

B. Theory: pump pulse and carriers generation

In order to properly simulate transient experiments the
eﬀect of both the pump and the probe pulses must be in-
cluded. The approach we follow here is to describe the
eﬀect of the primary pump ﬁeld by solving the Kadanoﬀ-
Baym equation (KBE), i.e.
the equation of motion for
the NEQ Green function G<
nmk(t, t′). The knowledge of
the G< function provides access to a wealth of theoret-
ical observables and it is also used, indeed, to calculate
the probe ﬁeld response. As the probe is much weaker
than the pump we can safely work in the linear–response
regime and compute the TR signal deﬁning a response
function functional of the G<. Under speciﬁc conditions,
the TR becomes a functional of the sole non–equilibrium
occupations at a speciﬁc time and the NEQ response
can be obtained solving the NEQ–BSE38, whose solution
gives direct access to the transient spectrum measured
by the probe pulse.

(i)

These approximations are:

the generalized
Kadanoﬀ–Baym ansatz23–26, (ii) a Markovian approxi-
mation for the collisions integral, known as complete col-
lision approximation23,36, (iii) an adiabatic approxima-
tion for the functional dependence on the density ma-
trix38 and last, (iv) the assumption that the excited car-
riers form a QP electron–hole gas.

The approximations (i)–(iii) have been already dis-
cussed in the literature. The adiabatic approximation, in
particular, is the core result of Ref. 38. Under these three
assumptions, we can consider the time diagonal G<(τ, τ ),
i.e. the density matrix, and project it on the KS (or the
QP) space, i.e. G<
nmk(τ ). Its equation of mo-
tion reads:

l (τ ) ≡ G<

∂tG<

l = ˜ǫl G<

l +

[∆ΣHxc, G<]l + [U pump, G<]l + Sl[G<],

(26)

with ˜ǫl the QP energies diﬀerence at equilibrium (see
Eq.(10)), ∆ΣHxc the variation of the Hartree plus ex-
change self–energy out of equilibrium. The l = {nmk}
index run on a 16x16x16 k–grid of the Brillouin zone,
with 3 valence bands and 3 conduction bands. Since the
KBE is solved in the KS space these are the only param-
eters needed.

∆ΣHxc ≡ ΣHxc − ˜ΣHxc,

is the variation of the
Hartree potential and the COulomb Hole plus Screened–
EXchange (COHSEX) self–energy (ΣHxc). Sl[G<] de-
scribes instead the relaxation and dissipation processes36.
In the COHSEX approximation the variation of the GW

7

self–energy is treated within the static approximation
(i.e. the screened interaction is assumed static and con-
stant during the time propagation). This constrain is es-
sential to correctly describe the coupling with the pump
pulse35. Numerically, the self–energy and the Hartree po-
tential are computed using wave–functions deﬁned on a
4x4x4 and then interpolated on a bigger 16x16x16 k–grid
by using a nearest–neighbor interpolation scheme.

U pump(t) = −V E(t) · P is the term which describes
the pump pulse within the dipole approximation in the
length gauge. P is the polarization per unit volume and
E(t) the pump pulse electric ﬁeld.

In order to mimic the experimental conditions, we used
a pump pulse with Gaussian envelope proﬁle and a car-
rier wave oscillating at 750 T Hz frequency, correspond-
ing to 3.1 eV photon energy. The full width at half max-
imum of the envelope is 100 f s. The pump peak inten-
sities we use range from 107 to 1011 W/cm2. The ﬁnal
comparison with the experimental TR is done for an in-
tensity of 109 W/cm2, which corresponds to a ﬂuence of
0.0886 mJ/cm2.

In our equation of motion we do not directly include
the induced macroscopic electric ﬁeld. This corresponds,
for example, to the transverse approach used in Ref. 66
Such approach implies that the simulation ﬁeld corre-
sponds to the total ﬁeld inside the medium. It can be
related to the incident pulse electric ﬁeld via the rela-
tion66

E inc(ω) =

1 +p˜ε(ω)

2

E(ω).

(27)

Eq.(27) is obtained by subtracting from the incident ﬁeld
its reﬂected part. As Re[ε(ω = 3.1)] ≈ 33 we have that,
neglecting the imaginary part Im[ε] which is smaller in
It follows that our simula-
tions should be compared with an experimental pulses
of 0.0886 × 11.4 ≈ 1 mJ/cm2. This value turns out to be
very close to the experimental ﬂuence of 1.13 mJ/cm2
used in this work.

Eq.(27), p˜ε(ω) ∼ 11.4.

The last approximation used is the electron–hole QP
gas approximation which assumes that the excited state
carriers form a gas of hot electrons. This ansatz is well
justiﬁed because, in our simulations, the carriers densi-
ties are above ≈ 1016 el/cm3, which is the critical Mott
density, ρM of silicon67. It is indeed well known that for
densities below ρM the carriers are trapped in excitonic
states and do not behave anymore as delocalized Bloch
electrons. Within this approximation the oﬀ–diagonal
elements of G<
for n 6= m, which describe the
polarization, can be assumed to rapidly decay due to de-
phasing eﬀects. Therefore, when the probe response is
measured, only the diagonal elements survive and deﬁne
the NEQ occupations

FIG. 4. (color online) The total number of carriers (panel a)
as a function of the laser pulse intensity (red circles) and the
maximum change in the electronic occupations (blue squares).
In the inset the total number of carriers as a function of time
and the pump pulse are shown for the pump peak intensity of
109 W/cm2, which corresponds to an estimated pump ﬂuence
for the incident pulse of ≈ 1 mJ/cm2. The holes (panel b)
and electrons distributions (panel c) at τ = 200 f s, for the
same pump peak intensity is also shown.

The number of carriers created by the pump pulse is
given by the diﬀerence with the equilibrium population,
i.e. fnk(τ )− ˜fnk. In the present case the carriers densities
excited by the experimental pump range from 1017 to
1022 el/cm3. More precisely, at a pump intensity of 109
W/cm2 the carriers density is 8 ·1019 el/cm3 (see Fig. 4.a
and its inset).

Fig. 4.a demonstrates the linear dependence of the
NEQ carriers excited by the pump pulse as a function
of its intensity. This ensures a linear dependence of the
TR signal characteristic of the low density regime. As
shown in the ﬁgure, only above 109 W/cm2 the number
of carriers deviates from the linear regime. The reason
is that at these very high pump intensities the carriers
approach the maximum occupation (fnk ∼ 0.5) which
can be induced by the pump pulse. At this high laser
intensities the eﬀect of the pump is not only to excite

8

carriers from the valence to the conduction band, but
also to stimulate the emission back from the conduction
to the valence.

In the following we will consider a pump–probe delay of
τ = 200 f s, corresponding to the experimental condition.
If we neglect the carriers relaxation (this means we set
Sl = 0 in eq. 26) the electrons and holes NEQ populations
are showed in Fig. 4.b-c.

These computed NEQ occupations will be used, in the
next sections, to highlight the renormalization of the dif-
ferent components of the dielectric function. More pre-
cisely their eﬀect will be described in two contributions.
The ﬁrst is the variation of the optical residuals deﬁned
by Eqs. (17) and (23) which will lead to a formal deﬁni-
tion of the concepts of bleaching, photo–induced absorp-
tion and stimulated emission (Sec. III C). The second is,
instead, the variation of the many–body self–energy and
of the BSE kernel introduced in Eqs. (2) and (18) which
will lead to the deﬁnition of the optical–gap renormaliza-
tion (Sec. III D). Once these eﬀects have been deﬁned in
terms of the dielectric function, then they will enter the
computation of the reﬂectivity and thus gives the theo-
retical TR of silicon.

C. Theory: probe pulse and residuals

renormalization

As we have already observed in sec. III A the TR sig-
nal is not easily associated with physical processes since
R(ω, τ ) depends on both Im[ε(ω, τ )] and Re[ε(ω, τ )].
Thus in this section we ﬁrst discuss the variations of the
dielectric function ε(ω, τ ). The TR signal is then derived
using Eqs. (24) and (25).

The NEQ dielectric function can be obtained from the
IP response function replacing the equilibrium residuals
with the NEQ ones in Eq.(21):

εIP (ω, τ ) = 1 − Xl∈Ψτ

R∗

l (τ ) ˜LIP

ll (ω)Rl(τ ).

(29)

As mentioned earlier ˜LIP can be either the ˜LKS equilib-
rium response function or the ˜LQP one deﬁned in terms
of the equilibrium QP energies. The NEQ residuals are
deﬁned, within the adiabatic approximation38 as:

Rl(τ ) = lim

q→0(cid:16) ρl,0(q)

q

(cid:17)pfl(τ ).

(30)

Eq. (29) can be naturally split in two terms according
the the indexes in the summation.

Equilibrium part: the transitions corresponding to in-
dexes l that belong to the equilibrium group ({l ∈ ˜Ψ})
deﬁne the bleaching eﬀect. In this case the reduced num-
ber of electrons in the occupied states (and holes in the
unoccupied states) decrease the absorption signal68.

Photo–induced part: when the index l belong to new
transitions induced not possible at equilibrium ({l /∈ ˜Ψ}).

only qualitatively described and the simulation misses the pe-
culiar behaviour of the experimental spectrum.

the ﬁnal level is greater than the energy of the starting
level (ǫnk > ǫmk), and the associated stimulated emission
vice–versa (ǫnk < ǫmk).

A simple and direct extension to the excitonic case
can be derived when the variations of the occupations
factors are small, |fnk(τ ) − ˜fnk| < 0.01. In this case we
can assume that the QP energies, the excitonic poles ˜Eλ
and the wave–functions ˜Aλ
l do not change following the
pumping process. We can, therefore, deﬁne the space of
equilibrium excitonic transitions {λ} as λ ∈ ˜Φ and

(32)

Note that the kernel of the excitonic matrix at the equi-
librium are diﬀerent from zero only in the case {l ∈ ˜Ψ},
i.e. if ˜fl 6= 0 (see Eq. (18)). Thus only the “equilibrium
part” of the absorption is written in terms of excitonic
poles while the “induced part” is identical to the QP en-
ergy diﬀerences.

The computed TR of silicon is shown in Fig. 5. The
main eﬀect is the bleaching of the ﬁrst absorption peak,
due to a Pauli blocking eﬀect induced by the NEQ occu-
pations. Thus the variation of the imaginary part of the
dielectric function (not shown) displays a negative peak
at approx 3.3 eV . Due to the Kramers–Kronig relations,

9

this corresponds to a reduction of the real part of ε(ω, τ ).
This explains the overall reduction of the reﬂectivity with
a constant negative TR signal. This eﬀect well describes
the negative TR in the low probe photon energy region,
but fails to capture the pronounced negative peak close
to the optical gap at about 3.35 eV and the associated
positive peak.

D. Theory: probe pulse and optical gap

renormalization

From Fig. 5 it is clear that the assumption of un–
perturbed excitonic energies (and wave–functions) is not
valid. For a better description of the TR signal we need to
compute their variation due to the presence of additional
NEQ carriers. Since we consider the excitonic energies
we also need to consider the variation of the underlying
QP band structure, ˜ǫnk.

We underline that the position of the absorption peaks
corresponds to the poles of the many–body response func-
tion which are uniquely determined by the many–body
Hamiltonian and cannot change, as it has been shown by
recent calculations on a model system with few poles69.
Thus any variation induced in the single–particle energy
levels of the system by the NEQ occupations has to be
exactly compensated in the calculation of the poles of
the response function. However when complex systems,
such as extended semi–conductors, are considered, the
number of poles increases and the description in terms
of all the poles of the many–body Hamiltonian is not
convenient anymore. Such systems are thus described in
terms of QP with eﬀective complex energies which are
assumed to capture the eﬀects of the interaction with
the rest of the system. Accordingly the corresponding
response function constructed from the BSE is described
in terms of eﬀective excitonic poles.

The variation of such eﬀective poles is not in contrast
with the fact that the real poles do not change.
In-
deed such variation, known in the literature as band–gap
renormalization, have already been measured in diﬀerent
materials70. However, to get a meaningful picture, the
renormalization of the QP and excitonic poles must be
treated consistently.

We show here that, within NEQ ab–initio-MBPT, both
the renormalization of the QP energies and of the ex-
citonic poles, is dictated by the simultaneous eﬀect of
the change in the screened interaction and in the car-
riers population induced by the pump pulse. Thus in
both cases we use a static approximation to the screened
electron–electron and electron–hole interaction. By fol-
lowing the adiabatic approximation38 we introduce the
NEQ COHSEX self–energy and the NEQ BSE. To this
end we ﬁrst deﬁne the NEQ statically screened interac-
tion, W τ as obtained by inserting the NEQ occupations
fl(τ ) in Eq. (13).

The static COHSEX approximation for the GW self–

energy then follows:

(33)

with

(34)

Thanks to the inclusion of the time–depedent occupa-
tions in W τ also the self–energy, and thus the QP ener-
gies, acquire a τ dependence. Therefore, quite in general,
the variation of the QP corrections can be expressed as

∆ǫτ

l = hl|Στ

cohsex − ˜Σcohsex|li.

(35)

From Eq.35 we can also deﬁne the NEQ BSE, which re-
duces to the computation of eigenvalues (Eτ
λ) and eigen-
vectors (Aτ
λ,l) of the NEQ τ –dependent excitonic matrix:

H τ

ll′ = ˜ǫl + ∆ǫτ

l −pfl(τ ) (vll′ − W τ

ll′ )pfl′(τ ).

(36)

Eq. (36) deﬁnes LBSE(ω, τ ) which is the NEQ version
of ˜L(ω) and can be written in the basis deﬁned by the
excitonic wave-functions Aτ

λ,l.

It is essential to note, here, that Eq.(36) lives in a tran-
sition space larger then in the equilibrium case. This new
space, l ∈ Ψτ , includes also the new trasnsitions created
by the pump pulse deﬁned by the condition f τ
6= 0. Nu-
l
merically, then, the NEQ BSE corresponds to a larger
matrix to diagonalize than the standard BSE.

In the low density regime, however, we can assume
that only the excitonic energies change and not the BSE
wave–functions. Indeed energies changes already at the
ﬁrst order in the perturbation, while wave–functions only
λ,l ≈ ˜Aλ,l and the resid-
at the second order. Thus have Aτ

The index l ∈ ˜Ψ since ˜Rl = 0 if l /∈ ˜Ψ and in practice only
bleaching eﬀects are included if the oscillator strengths
are assumed to be at equilibrium.

In this limit the NEQ absorption has the form:

interaction which enters Eqs. 33 and 36.

of L(ω, τ ) enters only via the NEQ occupations f (τ ). We
refer to this as occupations induced renormalization.

In Fig. 6.(a) the variation of the QP energies and of
the reﬂectivity are shown under these assumptions. We
notice that the QP corrections follow the NEQ carriers
distribution and are very small, only few meV s. The re-
sulting TR signal, shown in Fig. 6.(b), presents a deriva-
tive feature which can be understood as a blue energy
shift. However the signal is very small if compared to
the experimental data and thus the global eﬀect is, on
the average, negligible.

Screening renormalization. We then consider the eﬀect
on the TR due to the variation of the RPA screening only,
i.e. the τ dependence of L(ω, τ ) enters only via W τ while
the equilibrium occupation factors ˜fl are used.

In Fig. 7 the variation of the QP energies (panel a) and
of the reﬂectivity spectrum (panel b) are shown. First of
all, comparing Fig. 6 with Fig. 7 we clearly see that the
change in the QP energies and in the TR induced by the
variation of the screening is much bigger and this time of

FIG. 7. (color online) Renormalization of the quasi–particles
energies (panel a) from the COHSEX self–energy due to the
screening of the non–equilibrium carriers density. The change
induced in the reﬂectivity near the main peak is shown in the

malization of the electron–hole interaction (red arrow). Tran-
sient reﬂectivity (panel b) for a pump intensity of 109 W/cm2

the same order of the experimental signal.

Due to the presence of the NEQ carriers the screening
increases. The global eﬀect reverses what we saw in the
equilibrium case (Figs. 1-2). Thus the electronic gap is
closed, the bands dispersion is contracted and the reﬂec-
tivity spectrum is brought “back” towards the KS one.
We name this eﬀect as optical gap renormalization. The
optical gap renormalization enters in the same way in the
real and in the imaginary part of the dielectric function
and thus in the reﬂectivity. As shown in the inset of
Fig. 7.a it can be represented as the sum of two shifts of
the equilibrium spectrum: the reduction of the QP gap,
or band gap renormalization, due to the renormalization
of the electron–electron interaction (blue arrow), plus the
global shift due to renormalization of the electron–hole
binding energy (red arrow). It well describes the main

11

experimental feature, i.e. the sharp negative peak in the
TR around 3.35 eV .

E. Complete transient reﬂectivity

We have identiﬁed two main contributions to the TR
signal: (i) the changes in the residuals of the dielectric
function, which naturally extends the concept of bleach-
ing, photo–induced absorption and stimulated emission,
beyond the IP–RPA case; (ii) the optical gap renormal-
ization due to the variation of the the many–body self–
energy Σcohsex and the excitonic kernel K of the BSE
equation. This is split in an occupations induced eﬀect,
which we ﬁnd out to be almost negligible, and a screening
eﬀect, which is instead crucial to obtain a correct descrip-
tion of the main features in the experimental data.

We ﬁnally compute the complete QP renormalization
and TR signal including, together, all the eﬀects consid-
ered in the previous sections. In Fig. 8.a the total change
in the QP corrections is the sum of the two eﬀects rep-
resented in Section III D, with a dominant contribution
from the update of the screening.

In the same way the resulting TR (see Fig. 8.b) is the
sum of the eﬀects considered in the previous sections.
The complete NEQ dielectric function is computed from

εBSE(ω, τ ) = 1 − Xλλ′ ∈Φτ

R∗

λ(τ )LBSE

λλ′ (ω, τ )Rλ′ (τ ). (39)

where, this time, we include the eﬀect of NEQ occupa-
tions in the residuals

Rλ(τ ) = Xl∈Ψτ

q

Aτ

λ,lRl(τ ) where λ ∈ Φτ ,

(40)

as well as the renormalization of the excitonic poles via
L(ω, τ ).

The global TR signal can thus be explained in terms of
three shifts of the equilibrium reﬂectivity as shown in the
inset of Fig. 8.a. We have a red-shift (blue arrow) and a
second shift which is both a blue-shift and a reduction of
the peak intensity (red arrow). Last eﬀect is a shift (black
arrow) corresponding to a reduction of the absorption
intensity describing the absorption bleaching.

The computed TR spectrum well captures all the fea-
tures of the experimental measure. The only discrepancy
left is a 0.15 eV mismatch in the position of the nega-
tive peak. Such error is within the common precision
of ﬁrst–principles calculations and can be traced back to
a combined eﬀect of all the approximations introduces.
These approximations are essential to make these simu-
lations possible and, as clearly demonstrated by the deep
analysis of the diﬀerent contributions performed in this
work, does not weaken the predictivity power of the ab–
initio approach.

We further observe that the position of the peak in
∆R/ ˜R(ω) does not coincide exactly with the position
of the peak in ˜R(ω). Such a diﬀerence is explained in

the inset of Fig. 8.a. The maximum distance between
the equilibrium reﬂectivity and the NEQ one, and thus
the position of the peak in ∆R/ ˜R(ω), is shifted with
respect to the peak in ˜R(ω) and is due to the slope of
the reﬂectance. This detail could be better described only
computing the smearing of the peaks and also including
zero–point motion eﬀects in a fully ab-initio manner34.
Such approach however would be very demanding and
beyond the goals of the present work. Here we use instead
a ﬁnite and constant smearing η = 0.1 eV for the poles
in the deﬁnition of L(ω) (see Eqs. 11 and 20).

In conclusion, beside this discrepancy, the theoretical
approach captures and explains the sharp negative peak,
the negative signal in the low energy region and the pos-
itive signal in between. The ﬁnal TR signal shows a re-
markably good agreement with the experimental results,
considering the complexity and totally ab–initio, nature

of the calculations.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a combined theoretical and experi-
mental study of the transient reﬂectivity of bulk silicon.
Experimentally the sample is pumped by 100-fs pulses
at ≈ 3.1 eV , close to the optical gap; photo–excited car-
riers are injected from the top of the valence band to
the conduction band thanks to the thermal broadening
of the absorption spectra. The resulting TR spectrum is
measured 200 f s delay after the pump excitation. Theo-
retically, the interaction with the pump pulse is described
via the time propagation of the density matrix projected
on the basis set on which the equilibrium Hamiltonian is
diagonal. The interaction with the probe pulse is then
described within linear response theory computing the
non–equilibrium Bethe–Salpeter equation.

By means of this combined approach we gave a formal
and accurate deﬁnition of commonly used concepts like
the photo–induced bleaching, absorption and stimulated
emission in terms of the renormalization of the optical
residuals. Thanks to the use of the Bethe–Salpeter equa-
tion these concepts are deﬁned within a scheme able to
capture linear and non linear excitonic eﬀects.

Another key results of the present work is the deﬁnition
of optical–gap renormalization. Such a renormalization is
mainly due to the decrease of the screened interaction,
induced by the presence of the non–equilibrium carriers
created by the pump pulse. The optical–gap renormal-
ization includes and extends the well known band–gap
renormalization eﬀect. It is, indeed, more general as it
also includes a renormalization of the electron–hole inter-
action which is responsible for an additional contribution
to the transient absorption spectrum.

Combining the two eﬀects, i.e.

the residuals renor-
malization and the optical–gap renormalization, our ap-
proach well explains the transient reﬂectivity signal in
silicon. The characteristic features measured experimen-
tally are reproduced with a simple interpretation exem-
pliﬁed by three consecutive shifts of the equilibrium spec-
trum.

In conclusion, the present combined scheme is shown,
using silicon as a test case, to be eﬃcient and accurate.
The ab–initio basis makes it universal and opens the way
to a new approach able to describe ultrafast pump–probe
experiments of which, this work, is an essential step.

Indeed, the excellent agreement with the experimen-
tal results motivates further studies and extensions as,
for example, the inclusion of relaxation and dissipation
eﬀects and the systematic application to more systems.
The ﬁnal goal is to establish a theoretical method able
to describe and predict the outcome of pump and probe
experiments in a wide class of systems.

59 The symmetrization with the sqare root of the occupation
factors ensuares that the resonant and anti–resonant parts
of the excitonic matrix remain hermitian, while the cou-
pling parts remain symmetric. Thus the whole excitonic
matrix remains the pseudo–hermitian.

68 Im[ε(ω)] describes in general both absorption and stimu-
lated emission. However, considering the transitions possi-
ble from the ground state, i.e. at equilibrium, the associ-
ated absorption is maximum while there is no stimulated
emission. For this reason in the literature Im[ε(ω)] is com-
monly identiﬁed with the absorption only. Out of equi-
librium,
instead, absorption decrease while stimulated–
emission becomes diﬀerent from zero. Thus bleaching in-
cludes, rigorously speaking, the variation of these two ef-
fects and not a reduction of the absorption.
