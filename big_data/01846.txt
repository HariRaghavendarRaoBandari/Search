First-passage time to clear the way for
receptor-ligand binding in a crowded

environment

Abstract

Certain biological reactions, such as receptor-ligand binding at cell-
cell interfaces and macromolecules binding to biopolymers, require many
smaller molecules crowding a reaction site to be cleared. Examples include
the T cell interface, a key player in immunological information processing.
Diﬀusion sets a limit for such cavitation to occur spontaneously, thereby
deﬁning a timescale below which active mechanisms must take over. We
consider N independent diﬀusing particles in a closed domain, contain-
ing a sub-region with N0 particles, on average. We investigate the time
until the sub-region is empty, allowing a subsequent reaction to proceed.
The ﬁrst passage time is computed using an eﬃcient exact simulation
algorithm and an asymptotic approximation in the limit that cavitation

exponential, T ∝ eN0 /N 2
0 . For the case of T cell receptors, we ﬁnd that
stochastic cavitation is exceedingly slow, 109 seconds at physiological den-
sities, however can be accelerated to occur within 5 second with only a
four-fold dilution.

Diﬀusion drives many biological processes, both positively, by delivering
cargo to a target, and negatively, by removal of cargo from a region of in-
terest (ROI). While the temporal dynamics of diﬀusional delivery have been
extensively studied [5, 4, 24, 12], diﬀusion-driven removal has been less charac-
terized experimentally or theoretically [3]. Removal is of particular interest in
the crowded environment of cells, where large biomolecules and cellular struc-
tures require the displacement of smaller molecules, a phenomenon we term
stochastic cavitation.

A speciﬁc example arises in the study of cell-cell interfaces including the
T-cell/antigen-presenting-cell interface [22, 2, 29, 8] (see Fig. 1). A fundamen-
tal question for all cell-cell interfaces is how receptors and ligands come into

contact, despite being separated by large molecules, the extracellular ﬂuid, and
other structures in the glycocalyx. On either cell surface, large molecules such
as CD45 and LFA-1 undergo 2D diﬀusion in the cell membrane with a diﬀusion
coeﬃcient of D ∼ 0.1µm2/s [27, 6]. These large molecules impair interactions
between smaller pairs of molecules, such as the T cell receptor and its ligand—a
key step in immunological information processing and decision-making. It has
been estimated that a region of radius ∼ 100nm, devoid of large molecules, is
necessary for spontaneous T cell receptor interaction [2], which is occupied by
on average ∼ 30 particles at equilibrium. A natural question is whether this
empty region can form spontaneously in a biologically relevant time. Under-
standing contact formation will address cell-cell interactions in the crowded,
heterogeneous environment inside organisms and what machinery is necessary
for general cell-cell interactions [15, 31].

Examples of diﬀusional cavitation in biology also arise in other dimension-
alities.
In 1D, microtubules (inﬂexible polymers of the protein tubulin) are
decorated by hundreds of microtubule-associated proteins [1, 28]. These pro-
teins exhibit signiﬁcant crowding [11] and lateral diﬀusion along the microtubule
lattice [13, 17]. Large microtubule-binding molecules may therefore have to wait
for a region to be clear before binding. What is the mean time for such clearance,
and is it the rate-limiting step in microtubule binding? A similar situation oc-
curs for DNA and the myriad of DNA-binding molecules, some of which undergo
lateral diﬀusion across base pairs [16, 25]. A signiﬁcant waiting-time for large
DNA-binding molecules has potential implications for the study of the chemical
modiﬁcation of DNA and RNA, all of which require an enzyme to attach to the
polymer.

For some of the above scenarios, it has been hypothesized that clearance of
the target region requires an active process [2, 18]. To address the feasibility
of passive diﬀusion-driven cavitation, a theoretical assessment of the timescales
involved is needed. In other words, can diﬀusion-driven cavitation reliably oc-
cur on biologically relevant timescales? To address this question, we consider
N independent particles undergoing simple diﬀusion in either the 1D domain

presenting cell. CD45 molecules (black) block the receptor-ligand (purple) bond

(−L, L) or the 2D domain (−L, L)2. In each case, we study the ﬁrst-passage
time until a smaller region, a disk of radius L0, is empty.

The cavitation event can be rare (i.e., the ﬁrst passage time can be very
large compared to the diﬀusion timescale L2/D) under certain circumstances.
To understand this, consider the 1D domain with N particles. At equilibrium,
each particle has a uniformly distributed postion within the domain.
In the
limit L → ∞ and N → ∞ with the average particle density ϕ = N/(2L)
ﬁxed, the equilibrium probability of ﬁnding a region of radius L0 containing no
particles is small, P = e−N0, where N0 = 2Lϕ. Therefore, when N0 (cid:29) 1 we
expect cavitation to be a rare event. Although we might expect the 1D mean
ﬁrst-passage time (MFPT) to scale as1 T ∝ P −1 ∼ eN0, we instead we ﬁnd an
asymptotic scaling of T ∝ eN0/N 2
0 .

In this Letter, we develop a simulation algorithm to eﬃciently generate ex-
act realizations of the ﬁrst passage time, based on Green’s function reaction
dynamics [26]. For situations where cavitation is a rare event and computa-
tion becomes unfeasible, i.e., when N is very large or the ROI occupies most of
the explorable area, we develop an asymptotic approximation of the mean ﬁrst
passage time.
Consider N independent random walkers Yn(t), with n = 1,··· , N, that are
conﬁned to the interval −L < y < L. The ROI is the inner domain centered at
the origin with radius L0 < L. The event we wish to characterize is the ﬁrst time
at which the ROI is empty (i.e., minn{Yn(t)} = L0). We ﬁrst nondimensionalize
the problem using the space scale L and the time scale L2/D, where D is the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient. We deﬁne the nondimensional distances Rn = |Yn| /L,
 = 1 − L0/L, and l0 = L0/L. Then, a given particle is inside the ROI if
0 < Rn < l0.

By formulating a simulation algorithm, we can generate exact samples of the
ﬁrst passage time. We take advantage of explicit formulas for the probability dis-
tributions that govern single particle Brownian motion in a closed domain. Note
that even though we focus on the 1D and 2D cavitation problem in this letter,
exact distributions are also known for 3D Brownian motion [7]. The algorithm
proceeds as follows. Given a set of random starting positions {Rn(t0)}1≤n≤N,
select a particle that is inside the ROI and closest to the origin. That is, select
Rm = min{Rn} < l0. The ﬁrst step is to compute the ﬁrst time τ at which
the selected particle leaves the ROI (i.e., Rm(t0 + τ ) = l0). Once τ has been
computed, set t(cid:48) = t0 + τ. The cavitation event cannot have occurred before
time t(cid:48) because we are certain that Rm(t) < l0 for all t0 < t < t(cid:48). Therefore,
the position of the other particles between time t0 and time t(cid:48) is irrelevant, we
need only generate the random position for each of the remaining particles at
time t(cid:48). Once all positions have been updated, select a new Rm = min{Rn(t(cid:48))}.
We know that the cavitation event has occurred if Rm ≥ l0. If Rm < l0, then
1This problem is equivalent to the diﬀusion of a particle in N D dimensions (the product
of number of particles and dimensionality of space). Since N D (cid:29) 2, this Brownian motion
is not recurrent, so we might naively expect the system to be well-mixed in N D-dimensional
phase space, and the rate of ﬁrst passage would be the attempt rate times the probability of
being in the target state.

set t0 = t(cid:48) and repeat the above procedure.
At each step, the jump times τ can be sampled from the exact distribution
f (τ|r0), obtained from the fundamental solution to the diﬀusion equation with
a reﬂecting boundary at r = 0 and an absorbing boundary at r = l0. The
random positions can be sampled from the distribution p(r|r0, τ ), satisfying
the diﬀusion equation with reﬂecting boundaries at r = 0 and r = 1. An
eﬃcient way of sampling from p is to use a rejection method, similar to the
one described in [26]. For the jump time sampled from f, we found that the
rejection method could not easily be adapted to our situation.
Instead, we
sample the jump time using a root ﬁnding algorithm. Additional details are
provided in Supplementary Material. The simulation algorithm is maximally
fast in the sense that only the (average) slowest particle determines the next
event time, allowing us to eﬃciently access densities around φL0 ∼ 13. We ﬁnd
this is suﬃciently high to validate our asymptotic approximations.

To obtain a complete picture of cavitation in the rare event limits, we develop
an asymptotic approximation for the MFPT, ¯T . The approximation is derived
for 1D cavitation, and based on simulations, we observe that in the limit L → ∞
with a ﬁxed particle density, the approximation is also surprisingly accurate for
2D cavitation. We ﬁrst state the main results (Eqs. 46-37) and then summarize
their derivation.
For ﬁxed N, the ﬁrst term in the asymptotic approximation for 0 <  (cid:28) 1
of the MFPT, averaged over a uniformly distributed initial position for each of
the N particles, is given by

The constant CN is the Newtonian capacitance of a hypercube in RN; as ex-
plained below, it determines the far ﬁeld behavior of certain solutions to Laplace’s
equation [32]. An explicit formula for the Newtonian capacitance of a cube for
N > 2 is unknown. However, a good approximation for N = 3 is C3 ≈ 1.3214
[19]. The  (cid:28) 1 approximation (solid line) is compared to simulations (symbols)
in Fig. 2. For N = 3, we ﬁnd good agreement between simulation and the inde-
pendently derived estimate for C3 from [19]. From physical arguments detailed
at the end of this letter, we have determined an expansion of the Newtonian
capacitance for large N given by

The unknown constant in the above expansion is independent of all parame-
ters. Using the exact simulation algorithm, we obtain the numerical estimate,
α2 ≈ −1.67. Our MFPT calculation thus provides an approximation for the
capacitance CN, which otherwise remains challenging to compute [19].

symbols indicate 103 averaged simulations; the 1D simulations are shown as cir-
cles and the 2D simulations are shown as diamonds. Also shown is the L → ∞
approximation (dashed curve) for both 1D and 2D. Note that time is nondimen-
sional using the L2

0/D timescale.

N0 > 10. Hence, the eﬀect of a small domain size compared to the ROI is
to increase the MFPT, making the cavitation event more rare. This provides
a quantitative measure of when the domain size L no longer inﬂuences the
cavitation event, which is relevant when, for example, considering cavitation on
a relatively long strand of DNA compared to a shorter plasmid. Microtubule
ﬁlaments also vary in length.

Simulations of 2D cavitation are also shown in Fig. 4 as diamond symbols.
Although the asymptotic approximation (37) is derived for 1D, we ﬁnd that it is
a remarkably good ﬁt to the simulation data after changing a single parameter:
the prefactor κ2D ≈ 0.7. We therefore infer that cavitation is roughly three
times faster in 2D than in 1D. Heuristically, this speed-up occurs because the
mean time for a random walker to escape a spherical region decreases with
dimensionality.

The asymptotic approximations (46)-(37) for 1D cavitation are derived as
follows. Because all of the N walkers are independent, the problem can be
reformulated as the ﬁrst passage time of a single random walker in a N di-
mensional domain. Deﬁne the domain Ω ≡ (0, 1)N, and let Ω ≡ (1 − , 1)N

An approximate solution to (6) can be obtained using the method of matched
asymptotics [33, 10, 30, 9, 20]. We split the solution into two parts: an inner and
outer solution. The inner solution satisﬁes the absorbing boundary condition
on ∂Ω and ignores the reﬂecting boundary. The outer solution satisﬁes the
reﬂecting boundary on ∂Ω and is singular as r → (1,··· , 1). The two solutions
are then matched to obtain a uniformly accurate approximation using the Van–

By integrating (11) over Ω using (36), we ﬁnd that ˜T is the MFPT averaged

n = 1 and (cid:107)r − r(cid:48)(cid:107) = z, the

where AN is given by (45).
Matching the inner and outer solutions we ﬁnd that the z dependent terms
match provided that BN () = −2N AN 2−N for N ≥ 3. The remaining unknown
term ¯T yields the approximation (46).
In order to access the rare event limit where both N (cid:29) 1 and  (cid:28) 1, we
must ﬁnd how the Newtonian capacitance CN scales with N. This problem has
no known exact solution for N > 2 [19].

If the cuboid boundary ∂Ω were replaced by a spheroid with the same

Supplementary Material). The limiting result is the approximation Eq. (37).

While the approximation matches well with simulations in 2D, a more sys-
tematic asymptotic analysis for the 2D case should be feasible. For small  and

is that there are no terms in the expansion between the leading order term and
the O(1) term, making our 1D approximation converge particularly fast. This
feature is lacking in 2D, where there are other terms singular in , therefore we
expect this approximation to converge more slowly. In 2D for large L at con-
stant density, a diﬀerent scaling between N and L prevents the approximation
in (44) from converging, necessitating an alternative strategy that will be the
subject of future research.

Returning to the speciﬁc question of cell-cell contact at T cell interfaces,
large diﬀusing molecules such as CD45 disfavor proximity between receptors
and ligands on apposing cells. These molecules have diﬀusion coeﬃcients of
D ≈ 0.1µm2/s [27] and density such that on average there are N0 = 30 molecules
in the 100-nanometer ROI [2]. The approximation (37), using the prefactor
κ2D = 0.7 from the numerical ﬁt to simulations, yields an estimate of T ≈
109 seconds. In contrast, the MFPT for a single particle to escape a circular
domain is T = L2
0/(4D) = 0.025 seconds. Since T cell receptor triggering
occurs within seconds [14], the above calculation predicts that receptor-ligand
binding must involve a mechanism faster than passive diﬀusion. We therefore
suggest the alternative hypothesis that an active force drives receptor-ligand
proximity [2]. To obtain an empty ROI spontaneously in less than ﬁve seconds,
we would require N0 ≤ 7, corresponding to a four-fold dilution, which could be
experimentally accessible. The biological system is complicated by interactions
of large molecules within and between molecular species, lipid heterogeneity,
and transient immobilization, all of which could be exploited to dynamically
tune the rate of ligand binding and will be studied by expanding the present
framework.

For 2D cavitation, the outer boundary is a square of side length 2L. This
geometry allows us to reuse the jump propagator from the 1D algorithm to
update positions. The x and y coordinate of each particle are updated from
separate samples of the 1D propagator pr as described in the previous section.
The jump times are generated from the 2D distribution of ﬁrst passage times
to the boundary of a circle.

The 2D ﬁrst passage time problem is

We use a root ﬁnding method to sample the jump time.

B Parameter estimation
We use maximum likelihood to estimate parameter values in the large N expan-
sion of the Newtonian capacitance of a hypercube. We exploit the one to one
correspondance between α1 and β and between α2 and κ. The parameters β
and κ are estimated using realizations of the ﬁrst passage time. The likelihood
function is computed by assuming that the ﬁrst passage time is an exponentially
distributed random variable with mean

¯T ∼

κ

(44)
This assumption is valid asymptotically as N → ∞ when the ﬁrst passage time
is a rare event. The likelihood function for β and κ from n iid samples {τk},
k = 1,··· , n is given by

N βN−2 .

P ({τk} | β, κ) = exp

Two data sets were generated for N = 20, 25, 30,··· , 115, 120 with  = 10−5/N
and  = 10−6/N. A value of Tn was generated for each parameter set using
104 samples of the ﬁrst passage time from the exact simulation algorithm. We
numerically computed the maximum of the product of the likelihood functions
from all parameter values. The likelihood functions were computed on a 500 ×
500 grid for 1.5 < β < 2.5 and 1.5 < κ < 3. The resulting maximizers were

mates. Each symbol shows the sample mean of 104 simulations.

β ≈ 2.00 and κ ≈ 2.19. As shown in Fig. 5, ¯T and Tn are in good agreement with
these parameter values. The corresponding parameter values in the capacitance
expansion are α1 ≈ 3/2 and α2 ≈ −1.67. The capacitance approximation is
shown in Fig. 6 compared to numerical estimates. From the expansion, we
expect the error (given by the absolute diﬀerence divided by
N) to scale like
1/N 2 as N → ∞. We ﬁnd good agreement between the error and 15/N 2.
