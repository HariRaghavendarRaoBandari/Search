Abstract

We present numerical studies of fermion and boson models with random all-to-all interactions (the SYK

models). The high temperature expansion and exact diagonalization of the N -site fermion model are used
to compute the entropy density: our results are consistent with the numerical solution of N = ∞ saddle
point equations, and the presence of a non-zero entropy density in the limit of vanishing temperature.

The exact diagonalization results for the fermion Green’s function also appear to converge well to the
N = ∞ solution. For the hard-core boson model, the exact diagonalization study indicates spin glass
order. Some results on the entanglement entropy and the out-of-time-order correlators are also presented.

INTRODUCTION

Fermion and boson models with inﬁnite-range random interactions were studied in the 1990’s

and later [1–6] as models of quantum systems with novel non-Fermi liquid or spin glass ground

states. More recently, it was proposed that such models are holographically connected to the

dynamics of AdS2 horizons of charged black holes [7, 8], and remarkable connections have emerged
to topics in quantum chaos and black hole physics [9–15].

The model introduced by Sachdev and Ye [1] was deﬁned on N sites, and each site had particles
with M ﬂavors; then the double limit N → ∞, followed by M → ∞. In such a limit, the random
interactions depend on 2 indices, each taking N values. Taking the double limit is challenging in

numerical studies, and so they have been restricted to M = 2 with increasing values of N [5, 6]. It
was found that the ground state for N → ∞ at a ﬁxed M = 2 was almost certainly a spin glass.
So a direct numerical test of the more exotic non-Fermi liquid states has not so far been possible.

Kitaev [9] has recently introduced an alternative large N limit in which the random interaction
depends upon 4 indices, each taking N values; the saddle-point equations in the N → ∞ limit are
the same as those in Ref. 1. No separate M → ∞ is required, and this is a signiﬁcant advantage
for numerical study. The present paper will study such Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models by exact

diagonalization; some additional results will also be obtained in a high temperature expansion.

Our numerical studies will be consistent the fermionic SYK model displaying a non-Fermi liquid

state which has extensive entropy, and entanglement entropy, in the zero temperature limit. For

the case of the bosonic SYK model, our numerical study indicates spin-glass order: this implies

that the analytic study of the large N limit will require replica symmetry breaking [3].

The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section II, we review the large N solution of the SYK

model, and present new results on its high temperature expansion. In Section III we present exact

diagonalization results for the fermionic SYK model, while the hard-core boson case is considered

later in Section V. Section IV contains a few results on out-of-time-order correlators of recent

interest.

II. LARGE N LIMIT FOR FERMIONS

This section will introduce the SYK model for complex fermions, and review its large N limit.

We will obtain expressions for the fermion Green’s function and the free energy density. A high

temperature expansion for these quantities will appear in Section II B.

The above Hamiltonian can be viewed as a ‘matrix model’ on Fock space, with a dimension which
is exponential in N . But notice that there are only order N 4 independent matrix elements, and
so Fock space matrix elements are highly correlated. The conserved U(1) density, Q is related to
the average fermion number by

(3)
The value of Q can be varied by the chemical potential µ, and ranges between 0 an 1. The solution
described below applies for any µ, and so realizes a compressible state.

If we ignore the time-derivative term in Eq. (7), notice that the action has a SU(N ) gauge
invariance under cia → Uij(τ )cja. And indeed, in the low energy limit leading to Eq. (20), the
time-derivative term can be neglected. However, we cannot drop the time-derivative term at the

present early stage, as it plays a role in selecting the manner in which the SU(N ) gauge invariance

is ‘broken’ in the low energy limit.

In passing, we note that this phenomenon appears to be

analogous to that described in the holographic study of non-Fermi liquids by DeWolfe et al. [16]:

there, the bulk fermion representing the low energy theory is also argued to acquire the color

degeneracy of the boundary fermions due to an almost broken gauge invariance. As in Ref. [16],

we expect the bulk degrees of freedom of gravitational duals to the SYK model to carry a density

of order N [10].

Following the earlier derivation [1], we decouple the interaction by two successive Hubbard-

Stratonovich transformations. First, we introduce the real ﬁeld Qab(τ, τ(cid:48)) obeying

(9)
The equation above is required because the action is invariant under the reparameterization a ↔
b, τ ↔ τ(cid:48). In terms of this ﬁeld

Qab(τ, τ(cid:48)) = Qba(τ(cid:48), τ ).

2 Qba|Pba|2 as one term. Similarly, taking derivative

with respect to Qab, we have

Qab(τ, τ(cid:48)) = J 2|Pab(τ, τ(cid:48))|2.

(15)

If we only consider diagonal solution in the replica space (non spin-glass state), we can deﬁne the

self energy:

and the Green’s function

Then we have

Σ(τ, τ(cid:48)) = −Q(τ, τ(cid:48))P (τ(cid:48), τ ),

G(τ, τ(cid:48)) = −(cid:104)Tτ c(τ )c†(τ(cid:48))(cid:105).

P (τ, τ(cid:48)) = G(τ(cid:48), τ ),

and the saddle point solution becomes

iωn + µ − Σ(iωn)
Σ(τ ) = −J 2G2(τ )G(−τ )

The above equation shows a re-parameterization symmetry at low temperature if we ignore the

iωn term [9, 10]. At zero temperature, the low energy Green’s function is found to be[1, 10]

where C is a positive number, and −π/4 < θ < π/4 characterizes the particle-hole asymmetry. A
full numerical solution for Eq. (19) at zero temperature was also obtained in Ref. 1, and is shown

√
in Fig. 1. We can see the 1/

z behavior at low energy. However, it is not possible to work entirely

within this low energy scaling limit to obtain other low temperature properties: the iωn term is
needed to properly regularize the ultraviolet, and select among the many possible solutions of the

low-energy equations [4, 10].

B. High temperature expansion

Now we present a solution of Eqs. (19) by a high temperature expansion (HTE). Equivalently,

this can be viewed as an expansion in powers of J.

We will limit ourselves to the simpler particle-hole symmetric case, Q = 1/2, for which both G

and Σ are odd functions of ωn. We start with the high temperature limit

G0(iωn) =

1
iωn

(28)

and then expand both G and Σ in powers of J 2: G = G0 + G1 + ··· and Σ = Σ0 + Σ1 + ··· . The
successive terms can be easily obtained by iteratively expanding both equations in Eq. (19), and

repeatedly performing Fourier transforms between frequency and time.

Next, we describe our numerical solution of Eq. (19) at non-zero temperature. We used a Fourier

transform (FT) to iterate between the two equations, until we obtained a convergent solution. For

faster convergence, we started at high temperature, and used the above high temperature expansion

as the initial form. Then we decreased temperature to get the full temperature dependence. We

compare the large N exact numerical result with the high temperature expansion in Fig. 2. At high

temperatures, all methods converge to ln 2 as expected. The HTE results ﬁt the exact numerics

quite well for T /J > 0.6, but are no longer accurate at lower T . The exact numerics shows a ﬁnite

entropy density in the limit of vanishing temperature, with a value consistent with earlier analytic

results [4][10].

III. EXACT DIAGONALIZATION FOR FERMIONS

.

We now test the validity of the large N results by comparing with an exact diagonalization

(ED) computation at ﬁnite N . For the numerical setup, it was useful to employ the Jordan-

We built a matrix of the N spins and diagonalized it numerically. After obtaining the full spectrum,

we obtained both the imaginary part of Green’s function and thermal entropy, and our results are

compared with the large N results in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.

In this note, we focus on the particle-hole symmetric point. But particle-hole symmetry does not

correspond to the point µ = 0 in the Hamiltonian Eq. (1), because there are quantum corrections
to the chemical potential δµ ∼ O(N−1) coming from the terms in which i, j, k, l are not all diﬀerent
from each other, because these terms are not particle-hole symmetric. So we use a Hamiltonian

(39)

A subtlety in the above numerics, when µ = 0, is the presence of an anti-unitary particle-hole

symmetry. The ground state turns out to be doubly degenerate for some system sizes. If so, we
will have two ground states |0(cid:105) and |0(cid:48)(cid:105) in the expression of GR
i (ω), and we need to sum them up
to get the correct Green’s function.

To better understand this degeneracy, we can deﬁne the particle-hole transformation operator

P =

†
i + ci)K

(40)

(c

i

where K is the anti-unitary operator. One can show that it is a symmetry of our Hamiltonian
Eq. (34), [H, P ] = 0. When the total site number N is odd, we know any eigenstate |Ψ(cid:105) and
its particle-hole partner P|Ψ(cid:105) must be diﬀerent and degenerate. For even site number, these two
states may be the same state. However for N = 2 mod 4, one can show that P 2 = −1, and
then the degeneracy is analogous to the time-reversal Kramers doublet for T 2 = −1 particles. We
expect that all the eigenvalues must be doubly degenerate. For N = 0 mod 4, P 2 = 1, there is

no protected degeneracy in the half ﬁling sector. These facts were all checked by numerics, and

carefully considered in the calculation of the Green’s function.

10

(cid:89)

A better understanding of the above facts can be reached from the perspective of symmetry-

protected topological (SPT) phases. As shown recently in Ref. 14, the complex SYK model can be

thought of as the boundary of a 1D SPT system in the symmetry class AIII. The periodicity of 4

in N arises from the fact that we need to put 4 chains to gap out the boundary degeneracy without

breaking the particle-hole symmetry. In the Majorana SYK case, the symmetric Hamiltonian can
be constructed as a symmetric matrix in the Cliﬀord algebra Cl0,N−1, and the Bott periodicity
in the real representation of the Cliﬀord algebra gives rise to a Z8 classiﬁcation[14]. Here, for
the complex SYK case, we can similarly construct the Cliﬀord algebra by dividing one complex

fermion into two Majorana fermions, and then we will have a periodicity of 4.

A. Green’s function

From the above deﬁnition of retarded Green’s function, we can relate them to the imaginary
time Green’s function as deﬁned in Eq. (17), GR(ω) = G(iωn → ω + iη). In Fig. 3, we show a

the spectral function Eq. (38). The two results agree well at high frequencies. At low frequencies,

the deviations between the exact diagonalization and large N results get smaller at larger N .

For a quantitative estimate of the deviations between the large N and exact diagonalization

results, we we compute the areas under each curve in Fig. 3, and compare their diﬀerence:

As shown in Fig. 4, the convergence to the N = ∞ limit is slow, possibly with a power smaller

temperature limit S/N = ln 2. At low temperature, all ED results go to zero, but do approach the N = ∞
results with increasing N . Note that the limits N → ∞ and T → 0 do not commute, and the non-zero

We use this approach to compute the thermal entropy from the full spectrum, and compare

it with the thermal entropy calculated from large N equations of motion Eq. (19). As shown in

Fig. 5, the ﬁnite size ED computation gives rise to the correct limit s = ln 2 in the high temperature

regime, and it agrees with the large N result quite well for T /J > 0.5. Although there is a clear

trend that a larger system size gives rise to larger thermal entropy at low temperature, we cannot

obtain a ﬁnite zero temperature entropy for any ﬁnite N . This is due to the fact that the non-

zero zero temperature entropy is obtained by taking the large N limit ﬁrst then taking the zero

temperature limit.

C. Entanglement entropy

Finally, we compute the entanglement entropy in the ground state, obtained by choosing a

subsystem A of N sites, and tracing over the remaining sites; the results are in Fig. 7. For

NA < N/2, we ﬁnd that SEE is proportional to NA, thus obeying the volume law, and so even the
ground state obeys eigenstate thermalization [14]. We would expect that SEE/NA equals the zero
temperature limit of the entropy density S/N [17]. However, our value of SEE/NA appears closer
to ln 2 (see Fig. 7) than the value of S/N as T → 0. Given the small diﬀerence between ln 2 = 0.69
and S/N (T → 0) = 0.464848..., we expect this is a ﬁnite-size discrepancy.

IV. OUT-OF-TIME-ORDER CORRELATIONS AND SCRAMBLING

One of the interesting properties of the SYK model is that it exhibits quantum chaos [9, 13]. The
quantum chaos can be quantiﬁed in terms of an out-of-time-ordered correlator (cid:104)A(t)B(0)A(t)B(0)(cid:105)
(OTOC) obtained from the cross terms in (cid:104)[A(t), B(0)]2(cid:105) [11]. The exponential decay in the OTOC
results in an exponential growth of (cid:104)[A(t), B(0)]2(cid:105) at short times, and the latter was connected to
analogous behavior in classical chaos. In particular, Ref. 11, established a rigorous bound, 2π/β,

for the decay rate, λL, of the OTOC, and the Majorana SYK model is expected [9] to saturate
this bound in the strong-coupling limit βJ (cid:29) 1. In the opposite perturbative limit, βJ (cid:28) 1, one
expects λL ∼ J. Ref. 12 performed a ED calculation of the OTOC on the Majorana SYK model
in the inﬁnite temperature limit, β = 0. Here we will perform a similar calculation on the complex

SYK model, and also obtain results at large βJ. We deﬁne our renormalized OTOC by

OTOC = −(cid:104)A(t)B(0)A(t)B(0)(cid:105) + (cid:104)B(0)A(t)B(0)A(t)(cid:105)

.

We choose the Hermitian Majorana operators A = c1 + c

2. The negative sign
gives a positive initial value for OTOC. At inﬁnite temperature, the result is shown in Fig. 8.

We observe the fast scrambling eﬀect from the quick decay of OTOC, and the early time decay

[12]. At ﬁnite temperature, although we can perform the computation in the strong coupling limit

βJ (cid:29) 1, because of ﬁnite size eﬀects, we do not get the predicted decay rate λL = 2π/β. And
the OTOC only has a weak dependence on β even in the strong coupling limit as shown in Fig. 9.
Theoretically [11], in the large N and strong coupling limit, 1 − OTOC ∼ (βJ/N )e(2π/β)t. Fig. 9
does not display a large change in the exponent, and the pre-factor diﬀerence is also small. It

is clearly that of our small system sizes, J is the most relevant energy scale that controlling the

chaos.

V. SYK MODEL FOR BOSONS

Now we consider a ‘cousin’ of the present model: SYK model for hardcore bosons. The bosonic

case was also considered in the early work [1–4] but with a large number of bosons on each site.

It was found that over most of the parameter regime the ground state had spin glass order. We

will ﬁnd evidence of similar behavior here.

The Hamiltonian will be quite similar as Eq. (1), except that because of the Bose statistics now

the coeﬃcients obey

,

Jkl;ij = J∗

ij;kl

Jij;lk = Jij;kl
(47)
Hardcore boson satisﬁes [bi, bj] = 0 for i (cid:54)= j and {bi, b
i} = 1. Also to make particle-hole symmetry

diﬀerent, and we drop the normal order correction terms. The spin formalism in ED will be even

simpler, as we do not need to attach a Jordan-Wigner string of σz:

We can deﬁne a similar Green’s function for bosons:

bi = σ−

t0246810OTOC-0.200.20.40.60.811.2T/J=1T/J=0.1We identify the inﬁnite time limit of GB as the Edward-Anderson order parameter qEA, which can
characterize long-time memory of spin-glass:

qEA = lim

t→∞ GB(t)

(50)
Then qEA (cid:54)= 0 indicates that GB(ω) ∼ δ(ω). This is quite diﬀerent from the fermionic case, where
√
we have GF (z) ∼ 1/
z; this inverse square-root behavior also holds in the bosonic case without
spin glass order [1]. Fig. 10 is our result from ED, with a comparison between GB with GF . It is
evident that the behavior of GB is qualitatively diﬀerent from GF , and so an inverse square-root
behavior is ruled out. Instead, we can clearly see that, as system size gets larger, GB’s peak value
increases much faster than the GF ’s peak value. This supports the presence of spin glass order.

FIG. 10. Imaginary part of Green’s function for hardcore boson and fermion model. The peak near the

center gets much higher in the boson model when system size gets larger. The inset ﬁgure is zoomed in

near ω = 0.

Unlike the fermionic case, P 2 = 1 for all N in the bosonic model. We can apply similar symmetry

argument as in Ref. [14]: for the half-ﬁlled sector (only in even N cases), the level statistics obeys

the Wigner-Dyson distribution of Gaussian orthogonal random matrix ensembles, while in other

ﬁlling sectors, it obeys distribution of Gaussian unitary random matrix ensembles.

Our thermal entropy results for bosons are similar to the fermionic results: although the entropy

eventually approaches 0 at zero temperature, there is still a trend of a larger low temperature

entropy residue as the system size gets larger.

SYK model. It still satisﬁes volume law, and the entanglement entropy density is still quite close

to ln 2. Finally results for the OTOC are qualitatively similar to the fermionic results.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented exact diagonalization results on the fermionic SYK model. The trends in

the computed Green’s functions, high temperature expansion, entropy density, and entanglement

entropy all support the conclusion that the large N limit approaches the compressible non-Fermi
liquid state obtained in the earlier N = ∞ analysis. Note that the entropy density approaches a
non-zero value in the limit T → 0 taken after the N → ∞, and so the ground state itself exhibits
eigenstate thermalization. This conclusion is also supported by the volume-law behavior of the

entanglement entropy. The original model of Ref. 1 was argued [4] to have an instability to spin

√

glass order at temperatures exponentially small in

N ; the consonance between large N theory

and our ﬁnite N numerics indicates that the model in (1) (with a random interaction with 4 indices

[9]) does not have such an instability.

For the SYK model for hard-core bosons, our results for the single-particle Green’s function

were very diﬀerent, and indicate the presence of spin glass order. Similar quantum spin glass states

were examined in random models of bosons in Refs. 3 and 4.
