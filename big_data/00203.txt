Abstract—Wireless nodes in future communication systems are
expected to overcome three barriers when compared to their
transitional counterparts, namely to support signiﬁcantly higher
data rates, have long-lasting energy supplies and remain fully
operational in interference-limited heterogeneous networks. This
could be achieved by providing three promising features, which
are radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting, improper Gaussian
signaling and operating in full-duplex communication mode, i.e.,
transmit and receive at the same time within the same frequency
band. In this paper, we consider these aspects jointly in a multi-
antenna heterogeneous two-tier-network. Thus, the users in the
femto-cell are sharing the scarce resources with the cellular
users in the macro-cell and have to cope with the interference
from the macro-cell base station as well as the transmitter
noise and residual self-interference (RSI) due to imperfect full-
duplex operation. Interestingly enough, while these impairments
are detrimental from the achievable rate perspective, they are
beneﬁcial from the energy harvesting aspect as they carry RF
energy. In this paper, we consider this natural trade-off jointly
and propose appropriate optimization problems for beamforming
and optimal resource allocation. Various receiver structures are
employed for both information detection (ID) and energy harvest-
ing (EH) capabilities. The paper aims at characterizing the trade-
off between the achievable rates and harvested energies. Rate
and energy maximization problems are thoroughly investigated.
Finally, the numerical illustrations demonstrate the impact of the
energy harvesting on the achievable rate performance.

I. INTRODUCTION

Wireless communication systems are facing difﬁculties in
fulﬁlling the ever increasing demands of the customers oper-
ating in various communication standards. In order to fulﬁl
the rate demands of the users, the achievable rate region of
the users need to be improved. Enhancing the achievable rates
of the users with limited transmission power requires smart
transceiver algorithms and techniques. Simultaneous trans-
mission and reception within the same frequency band and
time slot, i.e., full-duplex communications is an outstanding
alternative for future communications, as it enables to almost
doubling the spectral efﬁciency when compared to half-duplex
operation. However, this comes not for free and additional
hardware and processing is required to cancel the resulting
self-interference due to the full-duplex operation [1]. Self-
interference can be partially suppressed passively by means of

transmitter and receive isolation [2], [3], or it might be actively
cancelled in analog and digital domain by signal processing
methods [4]–[6]. Thus, an residual self-interference (RSI),
which is assumed to be fully cancelled in most theoretical
works, still remains in practice. Moreover, transmitter noise
due to the non-linear behaviour of the power ampliﬁers and
limited dynamic range of the elements [7], [8] can not be
ignored as well for such applications.
Accomplishing higher data rates with corresponding signal
processing tasks requires longer lasting energy supplies both
for transmitters and receivers. Senders need to transmit with
limited power due to hardware constraint (battery life-time)
while the receivers are required to decode and process large
amount of data under similar conditions. Hence, the users with
infeasible plug-in recharging, demand energy which needs to
be provided in a wireless fashion. For this purpose, energy
harvesting-capable (EHC) receivers could be deployed which
harvest the energy in the environment, e.g., solar or RF energy.
Thus, the life-time of the system can be improved from the
energy in the air. The required energy is sometimes available
at a user’s surroundings and needs to be harvested, however,
sometimes the required energy is not at its disposal and needs
to be provided by the network. Thus, the study of power
transmission and energy harvesting has become the focus of
research community recently. For instance, the authors in [9]
study delay-limited communication with EHC nodes. In [10],
the authors develop an outer bound for the rate-energy region
considering energy harvesting constraints. Furthermore, the
authors in [11] focus on the sum rate optimization of an energy
harvesting MISO communication system with feedback. The
authors in [12] study the performance limits of MIMO broad-
cast channel, in which the base station (BS) is responsible for
both information and power transmission.
In this work we consider a heterogeneous two-tier network
with a single multiple-antenna macro-cell base station (BS)
serving K cellular users. Additionally, in a femto-cell, a pair
of multiple-antenna D2D nodes exchanges information in a
full-duplex mode. Hence, the full-duplex D2D users suffer
from both self-interference and interference from the cellular
macro-cell users and vice versa. All users in this heterogeneous
network, i.e., both cellular and full-duplex D2D users, are
assumed to be equipped with an energy conversion chain that
converts the incident RF signal energy to direct current in

2

order to load the energy buffer [13]. By this capability, the
users’ demand go beyond the traditional information transfer
perspective as they demand energy as well. Therefore, on
one hand self-interference and the interference from the other
users is deteriorating the process of decoding the desired
message reliably, on the other hand the users could use
the energy of the interference for EH purposes. Considering
energy and information rate demands of the users, we study
the performance limits of the cellular and D2D users in the
network. These limits are due to the intrinsic trade-off between
the demands. Considering this trade-off, the optimal rate tuples
of the cellular users and full-duplex D2D users capable of
EH are studied. Moreover, the optimal rate-energy pairs are
investigated. Thus, we address two main problems,

• What is the achievable rate region of the cellular users
and D2D pair under certain transmit power and received
energy constraints?

• What is the optimal rate-energy tuples of the D2D users

under cellular users’ QoS and power constraints?

joint

The two questions will be answered in an optimization
framework. We will
establish appropriate optimization
problems for
information detection (ID) and EH
transceiver structures and compare their performance. In
this work, different ID and EH receivers are investigated.
The users could be equipped with antenna separation (AS)
receivers, where the energy and information of RF signals are
caught simultaneously over different antennas. Power splitting
(PS) and time-sharing (TS) are other alternatives for joint ID
and EH purposes [14]. By splitting the received signal power,
the energy of one portion is converted to direct current in
order to load the energy buffer, while the information out
of the other portion is decoded. Time-sharing between the
energy harvesting and information detection phases allows
EH and ID in separate time instants.

performance with the speciﬁed receiver types, we employ
improper Gaussian signaling [15] in the transmission phase,
which has not been considered so far in two-way full-
duplex context (to the best of the authors’ knowledge).
Improper Gaussian signaling has been shown to be beneﬁcial
in interference channels (IC) and X-channels from the
achievable rate perspective [15], [16], [17], [18].
By utilizing improper Gaussian signaling, the outermost rate
region and rate-energy region is investigated by formulating
Chebyshev weighting function [19]. Then,
the problems
are reformulated as positive semi-deﬁnite programs (PSD)
with non-convex constraints. The non-convex constraints
are

(SDR) method [20]. Hence the resulting convex optimization
problems are solved efﬁciently. If the optimal solutions are not
rank-1, the Gaussian randomization process [20], [21], [22],
[23] is further utilized to acquire suboptimal rank-1 solutions.

which is composed of the diagonal elements of matrix A as,
B = diag(A). Matrix A is a positive semi-deﬁnite matrix if
A (cid:23) 0. The expectation operator is represented by E.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

In this paper, we consider a cellular network as shown in
Fig. 1 in which a base-station equipped with N antennas is
serving a set of K cellular users. This network operates in a
half-duplex mode, i.e., the uplink and downlink operation is
performed in successive time instances. In order to overcome
the limitations of their local battery supplies, the cellular users
are equipped with energy-harvesting (EH) receiver chains.
Those receiver chains capture the energy of the RF signals
in their environment. Further, in this cell two additional D2D
users are deployed, which exchange data in an underlay
cognitive mode, [24], [25], [26]. This exchange is performed
in a full-duplex mode, i.e., the D2D users are able to receive
and transmit at the time within the same frequency band. Here,
we follow the design proposed and utilized in [27], [28], in
which a full-duplex node is using a subset M of its antennas
for transmission and the remaining ones for reception. Similar
to the cellular users, the D2D users are equipped with EH
receiver chains.

Now, let the set of cellular users be denoted as C. For
convenience, we deﬁne the set of the two D2D users as
D. Then, the channel input-output relationships at each time
instant (we skip the time index for simplicity) are given by

Moreover, we assume here that the D2D users are equipped
with M + 1 antennas, where M antennas are utilized for
transmission and a single antenna is used for reception.

In this work, we assume perfect and global channel knowl-
edge except for the self-interference channel. This assumption
is due to imperfect self-interference cancellation in practical
full-duplex systems [30]. In more details, the self-interference
due to full-duplex operation is assumed to be cancelled to
some signiﬁcant extent (based on the channel estimate), but
not completely (channel estimation error). Thus, the received
signals at the D2D users can be rewritten as

where the information signal dj is beamformed in the direction

complex random Gaussian signals with unit variance. If the
real and imaginary part of dBk , ∀k ∈ C and dj, ∀j ∈ D
have equal power and are uncorrelated, then the signaling type
is referred to as proper Gaussian signaling. Otherwise, it is
referred to as improper Gaussian signaling [29]. We discuss
the differences between the two signaling types in more details

which states that the transmitter noise follows an improper
Gaussian distribution with zero mean and augmented covari-
ance matrix κ ˜Cxj with κ ≪ 1. Further, the transmitter noise
is statistically independent from the transmit signal, which
is given by (6). The assumption of an improper transmitter
noise is due to the generated improper information signal in
baseband and imbalance between the in-phase and quadrature
(I/Q) components, where the latter is discussed in
[31].
The authors in [5] propose a transmitter noise model whose
covariance is composed of the diagonals of the transmit signal
covariance matrix. By plugging their model in our general

model, (8) is recast as

(9)

The transmitter noise undergoes self-interference channel and
can not be cancelled at the receiver. This is due to the absence
of transmitter noise knowledge at the receivers. However, ex-
cept for the D2D users the contribution of the transmitter noise
can be ignored at all receivers. This assumption is valid due
to the low power of transmitter noise and relative strength of
self-interference channel compared to other channels. Hence,
the system model is simpliﬁed to

• Time sharing (TS): The users have the option to change
the receive strategy and by time-sharing between ID and
EH phases, (ID and EH in different channel uses).

For simplicity in presenting the optimization problems, we
distribute the aforementioned joint ID and EH techniques
among the users. As in Fig. 2, we allow cellular users to
harvest the energy of the incident RF signal by AS structure,
while full-duplex D2D users employ either PS or TS for energy
harvesting purpose. With the proposed structures for the users
in the network, we will formulate the achievable rates and
energies in the next section.

III. ACHIEVABLE RATES AND ENERGIES

In this section, we formulate the achievable rates of the
users assuming Gaussian codebook at the transmitters. In order
to decode the desired signals, the users ignore interference,
i.e., treat interference as noise. The users’ achievable rates are
bounded by (refer to Appendix A for the entropy expression
of Gaussian signals)

the augmented covariance
matrices of the received signal at the cellular and D2D users,

cellular user and jth D2D users are denoted by ˜Cwk and
˜Cqj , respectively. The augmented covariance matrices in (14)
and (15) are composed of the variance and pseudo-variance.
According to the deﬁnitions of variance and pseudo-variance
in Appendix A and the transmit noise model in (6)-(9), we
write the variance of the received signals in (12) and (13) as

Here, we observe the dilemma we are facing in harvesting
energy in this network. While the interference terms in ex-
pressions (12) and (13) are detrimental to the rate performance
as they represent harmful interference, they are beneﬁcial for
energy harvesting as they posses energy. In this work, we
investigate various types of ID and EH chains at the receiver
that will be discussed in the following. We utilize the models
introduced in [14] for simultaneous wireless information and
energy reception. For the purpose of ID, both cellular and full-
duplex users deploy single receive antenna. For the purpose
of EH, different structures are utilized,

• Antenna separation (AS): The users could be equipped
with an extra receive antenna for EH purpose. We assume
that the signals arriving at both antennas (one for ID and
one for EH) are experiencing fully-correlated channels.
Due to the small-size hand-held mobile stations,
the
physical distance between the antenna elements in an
array antenna is small. Thus the received signals are
highly correlated.

• Power splitting (PS): The users could split received signal
power for joint ID and EH in one channel use. This could
be achieved by utilizing a power splitter at the receivers.

the pseudo-variances of the received signals and interference-
plus-noise are required in order to obtain the augmented
covariance matrices required in the rate expressions in (14)
and (15). Based on the deﬁnition of the pseudo-variance in
Appendix A, we write the pseudo-variance of the received
signal as

In what follows we present an overview of the considered

optimization problems. In section

A. the optimal operating rates for the cellular users while

fulﬁlling energy constraints is investigated.

B. we optimize the operating rate tuples for the full-duplex

D2D users given rate demands for the cellular users.

A. Broadcast Users’ Rate Region under EH Constraint

Cellular users are capable of simultaneous ID and EH which
can be achieved by AS receiver structure. In this section,
we study the optimal achievable rate for these users while
fulﬁlling their energy demands. Our goal is to ﬁnd the optimal
rate pairs for the cellular users while fulﬁlling their energy
constraints. For this, we need to ﬁnd the Pareto boundary of
the rate region, in which all the rate pairs are optimal. Here,
the Pareto boundary deﬁnes the frontier for the achievable
rate tuples, such that an increment in the rate of one user
inevitably coincides with a decrement in the rate of at least
one of the other users. One way to ﬁnd the Pareto boundary is
to maximize sum of the weighted rates, [19]. In what follows,
we formulate sum of the weighted rate maximization problem
under transmit power and harvested energy constraints.

where αk are the elements of vector α, which prioritize the
maximization of the sum of individual weighted rates. In other
words, α speciﬁes the direction of optimization over the ﬁeld
RK. We deﬁne the set A as, A = {α ∈ RK |||α||1 = 1}. Solv-
ing (32) and scanning the rate region in different directions by
means of setting α ∈ {A} with a predeﬁned resolution will
deliver the Pareto-optimal operating points. The collection of
the Pareto-optimal points specify the Pareto boundary of the
rate region. Note that, the union of all achievable Pareto rate
tuples describes the achievable rate region deﬁned in (28).
In problem (32), the transmission power is limited due to
(32b), (32c). On the other hand, the cellular users are required
to capture at least Ψk energy from the received RF signal
for full functionality. The energy that has to be obtained by
user k is represented in (32a) which needs to be provided by
the BS and D2D users. The constraints (32f) and (32g) are
due to the feasibility of beamforming vector reconstruction
, i.e.,
from the optimum covariance matrices, Cxj and CxBk
feasible beamforming vectors can only be reconstructed from
any matrix in the set of rank-1 positive semi-deﬁnite matrices.
Note that, the optimization parameters are Cxj , ˆCxj ∀j ∈ D
∀k ∈ C, but we refer to them as Cx and ˆCx
and CxBk
in the formulations.

, ˆCxBk

Remark 1. The energy requirement Ψk, ∀k ∈ C might exceed
the BS capability and should be provided to the cellular
users by the D2D users. However, this turns the system to
a broadcast interference channel. Thus, on one hand, the

energy constraint would be fulﬁlled, and on the other hand
the achievable rate would demolish.

Apparently (32) is a non-convex problem. This can be
veriﬁed by plugging the entities in (16)-(19) and (20)-(23) into
(26) and (27). Then we observe that, the objective function
is neither convex nor concave function with respect to the
optimization parameters, i.e. Cxj , ˆCxj , CxBk
Remark 2. The objective function is non-convex even in case
of proper Gaussian signaling where the achievable rates are
bounded by Rproper
in (26) and (27). In this case
the the objective function is the difference of concave functions
which is not necessarily convex or concave.

Problem (32) suffers from non-convexity in the constraint
set as well. This is due to the rank-1 constraints (32f) and
(32g). Thus, the optimization problem (32) can not be solved
except by exhaustive search over the feasible set. However,
the computational complexity of exhaustive search is high
due to the dimensions of the optimization variables,
i.e.,
M × M and N × N complex matrices. Maximizing sum
of the weighted rates and maximizing the minimum of the
rates (known as weighted Chebyshev goal function) are both
able to manifest the Pareto boundary, [19]. Here, we focus on
the latter which can be solved more efﬁciently. Therefore, the
optimization problem that characterizes the Pareto boundary
of the achievable rate region is formulated as the weighted
Chebyshev problem as

a) In the ﬁrst step, we decouple the optimization problem
(35) into two optimization problems. The ﬁrst problem
contains the ﬁrst term in the rate expression in constraint
(35a), therefore the optimization variable would only be
the transmit covariance matrices. In the second step, we
rewrite the problem as a semi-deﬁnite program and solve
them numerically by interior point methods, [32].
The solution of this problem is used in the second op-
timization problem which involves the second term of
constraint (35a). Note that the only optimization parameter
in the second problem are the transmit pseudo-covariance
matrices.

b) In the ﬁrst step, The solutions of (a),

i.e. covariance
matrices obtained from (a), are used in the second op-
timization problem which involves the second term of
constraint (35a). Note that the only optimization parameter
in the second problem are the transmit pseudo-covariance
matrices. In the second step, after some deﬁnitions we
rewrite the problem as a semi-deﬁnite program and solve
them numerically by interior point methods.

In the following we discuss the steps in details.

a) Optimization of Covariance Matrix: Step 1: First we
focus on the ﬁrst term in the rate expression in (26) and
(27) to optimize the covariance matrices individually. Thus,
assuming Rimproper

Cwk , Czj and Cqj with the corresponding expressions in (16)-

where the BS transmits covariance matrix for a particular user,

convex due to the rank-1 constraints, i.e., (32f), (32g). We
deﬁne Γ(1)
as a function of transmit covariance matrices, i.e.,
Γ(1)
Step 2: Now, we have the separate optimization problem which
only depends on the transmit signal covariance matrices. Now,
we apply trace operation to (37b) and the numerator and
denominator of the expression inside the logarithm in (38). By
using the shift property of trace and deﬁning Hij = hij hH
ij ,
the optimization problem reduces to

By relaxing the rank-1 constraints, i.e., (32f), (32g), problem
(39) becomes a semi-deﬁnite program (SDP) for given Γ, since
the constraint set is convex. In order to get the optimal Γ
that makes the constraint set feasible, we utilize bisection
method. By bisecting over the objective, i.e., Γ,
the only

where SM and SN are the cone of M × M and N × N
Hermitian positive semi-deﬁnite matrices, respectively. The
solution of problem (39) coincides with the solution of (41)
for the maximum Γ that makes the constraint set non-empty
when the rank-1 constraints are relaxed. In the rest of the
paper we denote the optimal covariance matrices of (39) by
, ∀k ∈ C, and the solution of problem
C⋆
xj
(39) by Γ⋆.
The optimal covariance matrices are valid if and only if
they are rank-1. We proceed with the two following feasible
solutions,

, ∀j ∈ D and C⋆

xBk

I. The solutions are intrinsically rank-1: Then the corre-
sponding rates are achievable, i.e. all the points on the
Pareto boundary can be achieved by beamforming [32].
Thus, an eigenvalue decomposition of a particular opti-
mal solution, say C⋆

xj , yields:

xj = ujβkuH

j = ujβ

where uj is the eigenvector corresponding to the single
eigenvalue βj. Notice that, the beamforming vector for
the jth D2D user is represented by tj.

II. The solutions have higher ranks: We utilize the
Gaussian randomization procedure, [20], which ﬁnds
sub-optimal rank-1 solutions. Gaussian randomization
starts with generating ﬁnite number of vectors from
the Gaussian distribution with zero mean and C⋆
xj
xj ). Then, out of
covariance matrix,
the feasible beamforming solutions, the optimal one is
chosen. Gaussian randomization provides a sub-optimal
solution and the quality of the sub-optimality depends
on the number of randomizations.

i.e. N ∼ (0, C⋆

b) Optimization of Pseudo-covariance matrix: Step 1:
By considering the optimal covariance matrix of problem
(41), we have the optimal value for the ﬁrst term in the rate
expression in (26) which is denoted by Γ⋆. By plugging Γ⋆
into the ﬁrst term of (26), we optimize the pseudo-covariance

˜Cxj (cid:23) 0, ∀j ∈ D,
˜CxB (cid:23) 0,

where the power and energy constraints are dropped since
they are embedded in the covariance part of the augmented
covariance matrix.
Step 2: This step is described in Appendix B.

B. Rate Region of the D2D users

The coexistence of D2D communication in the crowd of
cellular users requires the study of the achievable rate region
of the full-duplex D2D users while guaranteeing rate demands
of the other users. We can resemble this case as a cognitive
network with cognitive users where, the cellular users are the
primary users and the D2D users are the secondary users.
Particularly, we consider underlay cognitive network where
D2D users are active only in case of fulﬁlling the primary
users’ demands. In this section we assume that the primary
users request only information and we formulate the maximum
achievable rate-tuples for the D2D users. The problem is
written as

we solve the SDP efﬁciently. Furthermore we compensate
the relaxation by Gaussian randomization method in order
to get a feasible optimal solution. Note that the optimiza-
tion problem of (46) yields the optimal transmit covariance
matrices while the rate region can be further improved by
optimization over the pseudo-covariance matrices. Optimizing
pseudo-covariance matrices for this problem is similar to
problem (35) which is elaborated in Appendix B.

C. Joint Rate-Energy Optimization (full-duplex D2D users)

In this subsection we present the rate-energy region of the
D2D users assuming self-interference and transmitter noise
with active base station. The full-duplex D2D users are
equipped with a single receive antenna. In a single-antenna
receiver, either information out of the received signal can be
extracted or the energy unless by power splitting (PS) or time
sharing (TS). First, we study the PS receiver structure, where
each D2D user splits the received signals power and decodes
the information of one portion and captures the energy of
the other portion. We formulate the optimization problem that
achieves the Pareto boundary of the rate-energy region as

We deﬁne η as the power splitting factor, so that η = 1
for pure information detection and η = 0 for pure energy
harvesting. Thus, joint EH and ID occurs by setting 0 < η < 1.

the optimal solutions does not fulﬁl the rank-1 constraints,
the Gaussian randomization procedure ﬁnds a suboptimal
solution correspondingly. The pseudo-covariance matrices are
optimized using the similar to previous sections. Please see
Appendix B for details.
Time sharing is the other strategy that could be utilize for joint
ID and EH in a single antenna receivers. The achievable rate-

By setting one user to purely decode information and the
other user to purely harvest energy, we can study the trade-
off between the objectives of different users. Suppose one
user, say user 1, harvests energy while the other user, say
user 2, detects information and vice versa. Therefore, we are

interested in the rate-energy region (R

that, not only the optimum covariance and pseudo-covariance
but also the optimum rate-energy pair is crucial, so that one
could decide which user to detect information and which user
to harvest energy. This problem is solved similarly and we
skip reformulations.

D. Joint Rate-Energy Optimization Simultaneously

Simultaneous optimization of the rates and the energies
jointly might be considered if the nodes are capable of EH and
ID at the same time. We can think of it by implementing one
extra antenna at the receivers. Thus, one antenna is used for
information detection, while the other harvests energy, (AS).
In this paper we do not discuss the optimality of using both
antennas at the receivers for improving achievable rates of the
users. Thus, we stick to a single-antenna information reception
system and an auxiliary antenna for energy harvesting. The
problem delivers the (2K + 2)-dimensional rate-energy region,

This optimization problem is solved using separate optimiza-

We proceed with the numerical results of the proposed opti-
mization problems in the next section.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we study the simulation results and discuss
the insights for the rate and energy optimization problems
formulated in the former sections.
Proper Gaussian signaling is numerically shown not to be
optimal for the investigated setup. Different aspects of the
network are discussed and the achievable rate region and rate-
energy trade-off are delivered. For simplicity in representation,
• We assume only two active cellular users in the network,
• We limit transmitter antennas to two.

The simulated direct, inter-user interference and the estimate
of the self-interference channels are unit-norm vectors which
are given in Table I.

Fig. 4: Rate region improvement of broadcast channel by improper
Gaussian signaling. The capacity region is bounded by the dotted
black frontier. The capacity of broadcast channel is achievable by
dirty paper coding (DPC) and proper Gaussian signaling at the BS
and TIN at the receivers.

A. Cellular Users’ Rate Region

In this subsection, we discuss the rate region improvement
of the cellular users when allowing improper Gaussian sig-
naling. We assume that an extra receive antenna is employed
in the cellular users in order to obtain the required amount of
energy from the RF signals. The channel that is experienced by
the information decoding chain and energy harvesting chain is
assumed to be fully correlated. The discussions in this section
are based on the solution of problem (33).
It is of importance to note that, the capacity of the MIMO
broadcast Gaussian channel is achieved by treating interfer-
ence as noise (TIN) in the receivers and dirty paper cod-
ing (DPC) at the transmitter with proper Gaussian signal-
ing, [33], [34]. In order to show the performance of Gaussian
signaling with linear precoding, we compare the achievable
rate region with the optimal scheme (DPC which is a non-
linear precoding scheme) that achieves the capacity. Figure
4 compares the achievable rate region of improper Gaussian
signaling, proper Gaussian signaling and DPC scheme.

Remark 4. The broadcast channel investigated in this paper
suffers from interference caused by the D2D users which are

active in order to satisfy the cellular users’ energy demands.
Note that, for the broadcast Gaussian channel with EH con-
straints, the capacity is still unknown.

Now, it is required that, the cellular users obtain particular
RF energy from the environment. The case might happen
that
the required energy is far more than that exists in
their surroundings. Hence power should be transmitted to the
cellular users in order to fulﬁl the energy demands. If the
demanded energy can be provided by the BS, it is rate-optimal
for the cellular users if the D2D users remain silent. But if
the demanded energy is more than the BS capability, the D2D
users get activated to fulﬁl the cellular users’ energy demands.
In this case, on one hand the interference from the D2D users
fulﬁls the energy demands of the cellular users and on the
other hand, this interference reduces the achievable rates of the
cellular users. Hence, in order to guarantee the cellular users’
demands, simultaneous information and energy transmission
is required to fulﬁl the network constraints. If the interference
from the D2D users appear, improper Gaussian signaling helps
in enlarging the achievable rate region. Figure 5 illustrates
the rate region improvement by allowing improper Gaussian
signaling. Considering energy demands, the rate region of DPC
is improved by improper Gaussian signaling which is depicted
in Fig. 6a. The convex hull of all achievable rates by both
encoding orders is also achieved by time sharing which is
shown by black dashed curves. The performance of utilizing
and not utilizing DPC in the energy constrained broadcast
channel is given in Fig. 6b. When the BS utilizes DPC, it
codes the message in a way that the received signal in one
user is free from the interference from the other user. This
type of coding is beneﬁcial from information rate perspective
but it is detrimental from the energy viewpoint. In this case,
if the cellular users’ energy demands are high enough, DPC
becomes an inefﬁcient coding scheme. The inefﬁciency of
DPC is shown in Fig. 6b, where the rate region of the cellular
users is almost the same as the case of not utilizing DPC.

Fig. 6: Improper signaling boosts the achievable rate region of DPC
when EH constraints for the cellular users accedes a threshold. The
cellular users are assumed to capture 6 units of energy from the RF
signal. Antenna separation is the receiver structure for ID and EH
purposes.

B. Full-Duplex D2D

The performance of full-duplex D2D users is evaluated in
this subsection. We consider the case, where D2D users behave
as underlay cognitive radios. Hence they are allowed to be
active just in case that the demands of the primary users
(cellular users) are fulﬁlled. Having this in mind that the
primary users are supposed to fulﬁl certain rate constraints,
D2D users maximize the achievable rates and energies. By
utilizing improper signaling, the rate region of the D2D users
is enlarged as is Fig. 7. Rate-energy region for a full-duplex
node is studied where, PS and TS are the joint ID and EH
techniques. Assuming PS receiver (refer to problem (49)),
in order to achieve maximum rate at a full-duplex user, BS
needs to be silent while maximum power delivered to the D2D
user is achieved when the BS transmit with maximum power.
Consider a case where a full-duplex D2D user runs out of
power. In this case it is optimal to restrict the operating at the
receivers to EH (no PS). Moreover, the transmitters need to
direct their beams into the direction that delivers maximum
power for that user (maximum ratio transmission in direction
of the user). This operating point is depicted in Fig. 8, where

duplex node is achieved when the BS forms its beam so that
the least power hits the user (achieved by zero-forcing). This
can be observed in Fig. 8, where the plots cross the horizontal
axis. According to this ﬁgure,
the efﬁciency of improper
Gaussian signaling from the rate and energy perspective is
vivid. If we share time (TS structure) between EH and ID
phases in a particular D2D user, the black straight line consists
of the outermost achievable rate and energy tuples. We studied
the trade-off between full-duplex D2D users as well, where the
ﬁrst user is assumed to purely harvest energy and the second
user requires information only and vice versa. The numerical
results of the achievable rate-energy region for this strategy
is depicted in Fig. 9, (refer to problem (58)). Intuitively,
maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming at the BS
and D2D users toward the ﬁrst D2D user, maximizes the

energy and information demands of the users, different prac-
tical receiver structures for joint energy harvesting and infor-
mation detection are investigated, namely, antenna separation,
power splitting and time sharing. The performance of these
types of receivers are manifested while improper Gaussian
signaling is proposed to be utilized at the transmitters. we
observed that, if the energy demands of the cellular users is
out of the capability of the BS, the full-duplex D2D users aid
in fulﬁlling the demands and it is not necessary to utilize non-
linear dirty paper coding at the BS in case of high-enough
energy demands. The achievable rate region of the users in
the network and the achievable rate-energy region of the full-
duplex users are studied and the optimal beamforming and
resource allocation solutions are delivered.

APPENDIX A

We introduce proper/improper Gaussian signals, we will
discuss their entropy and the possible beneﬁts of improper
signaling, which will be utilized in the setup considered in
this paper.

Let x be a zero-mean complex-valued Gaussian random
vector (RV) which is a vector of random variables with the
kth element as, xk = xkr + jxki. The second-order moments
of x are given by

Cx = E{xxH },
ˆCx = E{xxT },

(61)
(62)

where Cx and ˆCx specify the covariance and pseudo-
covariance matrices of x, respectively. For instance, for a
RV of length two (two independent random entries), x =

(cid:0)x1 x2(cid:1)T , the second-order moment is written as

received signal energy at the ﬁrst D2D user, i.e., E
type of transmission is not rate optimal for the second D2D
2. Thus, due to the priority weights of the rate
users, i.e., R
and the energy optimization, all the points on the rate-energy
region boundaries are achievable by optimum beamforming
vectors.

C. Joint rate and energy maximization

In this subsection, we discus the performance of

the
investigated setup, when each receive antenna either decodes
information or extracts the energy of the incident RF signal.
Cellular users are able to harvest energy from the RF signal in
the environment and decode information simultaneously with
maximum power through AS receiver structure. However,
D2D users are equipped with a single receive antenna and
the receivers consume the whole received signal with its
maximum power for ID purpose. In other words, D2D users
are not demanding energy at a particular time and their main
concern is information, (refer to problem 59)).
For two cellular users (demanding information and energy)
and two D2D users (demanding information only), some
interesting operating point on the boundary of six-dimensional
rate-energy region is depicted in Table II. According to this
table, by allowing improper Gaussian signaling, the achievable
sum rate can be improved compared to proper Gaussian
signaling. This improvement in the achievable sum rate can
be manifested in the energy as well. That means, considering
the rate demands to be fulﬁlled by proper Gaussian signaling,
the users can harvest more energy if the transmission scheme
is improper Gaussian signaling.

VI. CONCLUSION

For a proper Gaussian random variable xk = xkr + jxki, we
have

E{xkx∗

k} = E{xkr x∗

kr } + E{xki x∗

ki }

In this paper, we studied the rate and energy performance of
a two-tier network which is composed of a full-duplex device-
to-device communication incorporated in a macro-cell with a
base station. Furthermore, we investigated the advantage of
full-duplex D2D uses in aiding the cellular users. Due to the

= Pkr + Pki = 2Pkr , ∀k ∈ {1, 2},

(65)

E{xkxk} = E{xkr xkr } − E{xki xki } + 2jE{xkr xki }

= Pkr − Pki + 2jCov(xkr , xki ) = 0,

E{xkx∗

l } = 0, E{xkxl} = 0, ∀l 6= k,

(66)
(67)

14

where Pkr and Pki are the power of the real and imaginary
components, respectively. Therefore, ˆCx = 0 for proper Gaus-
sian signals due to equal power allocation for the real and
imaginary components and zero correlation between them.
Allowing the freedom for unequal power allocation and cor-
relation between the real and imaginary components of the
complex signal, the pseudo-covariance matrix is not a zero
matrix, i.e., ˆCx 6= 0, and it is complex-valued in general.
In this case, Cx can not solely describe the second-order
moment of x , but the pseudo-covariance matrix ( ˆCx) is
required as well. Authors in [29] introduce an augmented
covariance matrix that includes both of the covariance and
pseudo-covariance of the complex random vector which is
given by

˜Cx =(cid:18)Cx

ˆC∗

ˆCx
x C∗

x(cid:19) .

(68)

It is of importance to mention that, the augmented covariance
matrix holds all of the properties of a covariance matrix, i.e.,
positive semi-deﬁnite and Hermitian.

Entropy of improper Gaussian random vector: Now, we can
express the entropy of a complex Gaussian random vector x
as, [29]:

h(x) =

1
2

log(cid:16)(2πe)2M | ˜Cx|(cid:17) ,

(69)

where x ∈ CM×1. For the case of proper Gaussian where
ˆCx = 0 ,
the entropy expression reduces to h(x) =
log((πe)M |Cx|).
By considering the differences between the proper and im-
proper Gaussian signals. Here we show the sub-optimality
of proper signaling for networks in which the receive nodes
suffer from interference which is treated as noise. To this end,
consider the two-user full-duplex MISO channel as in Fig. 2.
We write the mutual information between the transmit and
receive signal of the D2D users as follows [35]:

I(zj; xi|xj, gji, gjB) =h(zj|xj, gji, gjB)−

h(zj|xi, xj, gji, gjB),

∀j, i ∈ D, i 6= j.

(70)

We need to maximize the mutual
the
distribution of the transmit signal, while receivers utilize TIN
strategy. We study the following two cases.

information over

Case 1. Assuming an silent BS, perfect SI cancellation and

absence of transmitter noise, (70) is given by

I(zj; xi|xj , gji, gjj) = h(gH

ji xi) − h(nj),

∀j, i ∈ D, i 6= j.
(71)

We observe that the second term does not depend on the
transmit signals. In this case, the optimal transmission scheme
would be proper Gaussian transmission [35], [36]. Since,
either non-equal power allocation or any correlation between
the real and imaginary components of the complex Gaussian
signal reduces the ﬁrst entropy expression in (71) which
results is reducing the mutual information.

Case 2. Assuming an active BS, for the two-user full-duplex
with RSI and transmitter noise, we can explain (70) as follows:
Considering (70), it is not clear that proper Gaussian signaling
is the optimal Gaussian signaling. It might turn out that, by
switching from proper to improper Gaussian signals, the terms
h(zj|xj , xi, gji, gjB), ∀j, i ∈ D, i 6= j decrease more than the
decrement of h(zj|xj, gji, gjB), ∀j ∈ D, which would result
in an overall increase in (70).
Therefore, in scenario 2 we have the opportunity to maximize
the rates of the users by improper Gaussian transmission.
