ABSTRACT
According to the current cosmological cold dark matter paradigm, the Galactic halo
could have been the result of the assemblage of smaller structures. Here we explore the
hypothesis that the classical and ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal satellites of the Milky
Way have been the building blocks of the Galactic halo by comparing their [α/Fe]
and [Ba/Fe] versus [Fe/H] patterns with the ones observed in Galactic halo stars. The
α elements deviate substantially from the observed abundances in the Galactic halo
stars for [Fe/H] values larger than -2 dex, while they overlap for lower metallicities. On
the other hand, for the [Ba/Fe] ratio the discrepancy is extended at all [Fe/H] values,
suggesting that the majority of stars in the halo are likely to have been formed in situ.
Therefore, we suggest that [Ba/Fe] ratios are a better diagnostic than [α/Fe] ratios.
Moreover, for the ﬁrst time we consider the eﬀects of an enriched infall of gas with the
same chemical abundances as the matter ejected and/or stripped from dwarf satellites
of the Milky Way on the chemical evolution of the Galactic halo. We ﬁnd that the
resulting chemical abundances of the halo stars depend on the assumed infall time
scale, and the presence of a threshold in the gas for star formation. In particular, in
models with an infall timescale for the halo around 0.8 Gyr coupled with a threshold
in the surface gas density for the star formation (4 M⊙ pc−2), and the enriched infall
from dwarf spheroidal satellites, the ﬁrst halo stars formed show [Fe/H]>-2.4 dex. In
this case, to explain [α/Fe] data for stars with [Fe/H]<-2.4 dex we need stars formed
in dSph systems.

INTRODUCTION

The formation and evolution of the Milky Way (MW) halo
has been the subject of several investigations in the past
years, and a great deal of observational work has been done
in order to obtain more and more precise abundance deter-
minations in stars in the Galaxy and Local Group galaxies.
We recall here a number of on-going and planned spectro-
scopic MW survey, such as RAVE (Steinmetz et al. 2006),
SEGUE (Yanny et al. 2009), APOGEE ( Majewski et al.
2010), HERMES (Freeman 2010), Gaia-ESO (Gilmore et al.
2012).

A crucial information regarding the dominant mech-
anisms responsible for the formation of the MW halo is
encoded in the chemical and kinematical properties of its

member stars. In particular, the study of the MW stellar
halo provides several clues about the earliest phases of the
Galaxy evolution, since the halo is the easiest place where to
ﬁnd the most metal-poor and oldest stars currently known
in the Universe although very old stars could be found also
in the bulge of the MW (White & Springel 2000).

The current cosmological Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM)
paradigm envisages the assemblage of large structures in the
Universe as starting from the coalescence of smaller ones, via
cooling and condensation of gas in always larger dark matter
halos (Press & Schechter 1974; White & Rees 1978; Springel,
Frenk & White 2006). According to the ΛCDM model, a
MW-like galaxy must have formed by the coalescence of a
large number of smaller systems which, even today, might
be still in the process of being accreted. In particular, dwarf
spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) were proposed in the past as
the best candidate small progenitor systems, which merged

2

Spitoni et al.

through cosmic time to eventually form the stellar halo com-
ponent of the Galaxy (e.g. Grebel 2005). The MW dSph
satellites have been soon recognized among the faintest and
most dark matter dominated stellar systems ever observed
in the Universe, before the discovery of ultra-faint dwarf
galaxies. Nevertheless, the role played by dSphs in shaping
the halo of the MW still remains controversial. Major issues
are the still relatively small number of discovered Galaxy
satellites (the so-called missing satellite problem, e.g. Bul-
lock 2010, Klypin et al. 1999, and Moore et al. 1999) and
the diﬀerent chemical abundance patterns in halo and dSph
stars (Shetrone et al. 2001, Venn et al. 2004, Vincenzo et al.
2014).

In order to test the capability of the hierarchical galaxy
formation scenario to explain the MW halo metallicity dis-
tribution function (MDF), Prantzos (2008) presented the re-
sults of an approximated analytical model, where the Galaxy
stellar halo was assumed to assemble by means of successive
merger events of small sub-halos with similar physical prop-
erties as current dSphs. Although the treatment of the inter-
stellar medium (ISM) chemical evolution was very simple,
Prantzos (2008) claimed to reproduce the Galaxy halo MDF,
since his results rely on the stellar mass distribution function
of the merging sub-halo population, which the current hier-
archical galaxy formation paradigm can predict with very
high accuracy. Nevertheless, Prantzos (2008) did not dis-
cuss any implication on the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance
pattern, which is one of the main issues which hierarchical
picture has to deal with, since the abundance patterns of
surviving Local Group galaxies do not match those of the
stars in the stellar halo.

It is worth reminding that Unavane et al. (1996) and
Jofre & Weiss (2011) used the age distributions of stars in
the halo and dSphs to test the origin of halo stars.

Interestingly, by making use of a chemical evolution
model within a cosmological framework, Font et al. (2006)
found that the discrepancy in the [α/Fe] ratios can be solved
if the majority of the MW halo formed by accreting sub-
halos with mass in the range 105-108M⊙, which had been
disrupted very early (> 8-9 Gyr ago).

On the other hand, Fiorentino et al. (2015) using RR
Lyrae stars as tracers of the Galactic halo ancient stellar
component, showed that dSphs do not appear to be the ma-
jor building-blocks of the halo. Leading physical arguments
suggest an extreme upper limit of 50% to their contribution.

In recent years, Willman et al. (2005) and Belokurov
et al (2006a,b, 2007) using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS, York et al. 2000) were able to discover an entirely
new population of hitherto unknown stellar systems: the so-
called ultra faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies (UfDs), which are
characterized by extremely low luminosities, high dark mat-
ter content, and very old and iron-poor stellar populations
(Belokurov et al. 2006a; Norris et al (2008, 2010); Brown et
al 2012). Furthermore, UfD systems are observed to be com-
pletely gas-free at the present time. The number of UfDs has
increased constantly in the last decade and completeness es-
timates suggest that many more of these faint satellites are
still to be discovered in the Local Group (Tollerud et al.
2008). This fact might place them as the survived building
blocks of the Galaxy stellar halo, dramatically lacking in the
past.

The main aims of this work can be summarized as fol-

lows.

(i) We test the hypothesis that dSph and UfD galaxies
have been the building blocks of the Galactic halo, by as-
suming that the halo formed by accretion of stars belonging
to these galaxies.

(ii) We explore the scenario, in which the Galactic halo
formed by accretion of chemically enriched gas originating
from dSph and UfD galaxies.

In Spitoni (2015), using the formalism described by
Matteucci (2001), Recchi et al. (2008), and Spitoni et al.
(2010) it was shown, for the ﬁrst time, an analytical solution
for the evolution of the metallicity of a galaxy in presence of
“environment” eﬀects. In this work a galaxy suﬀers, during
its evolution, the infall of enriched gas from another evolving
galactic system, with this gas having chemical abundances
variable in time.

In this work we extend the results of Spitoni (2015)
to detailed chemical evolution models in which the Instan-
taneous Recycling Approximation (IRA) is relaxed, for the
particular case of the chemical enrichment of the Galactic
halo surrounded by dSph and UfD galaxies.

The paper is organized as follows:

in Section 2 we
present our chemical evolution models for the Galaxy, dSph
and UfD galaxies, in Section 3 we describe the way in which
we implement the enriched gas infall on the chemical evolu-
tion of the Galactic halo. The results are presented in Section
4. Finally, our conclusions are summarized in Section 5..

2 THE CHEMICAL EVOLUTION MODELS

In this work for the ﬁrst time we present a chemical evolution
model where we assume that the Galactic halo is formed by
accretion of enriched gas with chemical abundances identical
to those of gas outﬂowing/stripped from dSph, and UfD
galaxies. In this section we will give some details related to
the reference chemical evolution models considered in this
paper for the MW, dSph, and UfD galaxies.

For the star formation rate (SFR) all the Milky Way

models adopt the following Kennicutt (1998) like law:

ψ(t) ∝ νσk
g ,

(1)

where ν is the star formation eﬃciency, σg is the surface gas
density, and k is the gas surface exponent, with an exponent
k=1.5. On the other hand, the SFRs of dSph and UfD galax-
ies are considered proportional to the volume gas density ρg
with an exponent k=1:

ψ(t) ∝ νρk
g .

(2)

In Romano et al. (2015) it is recalled that originally
Kennicutt (1998) law refers to surface densities. They show
that for star-forming regions with roughly constant scale-
heights, the surface densities can be turned into volume
densities. Moreover, using the fact that the Kennicutt law
indicates that the star formation rate is controlled by the
self-gravity of the gas, it is possible to show the equivalence
between k=1.5 in eq. (1) and k=1 in eq. (2).

2.1 The Milky Way

We will consider the following two reference chemical evolu-
tion models for the MW galaxy:

(i) The classical two-infall model (2IM) presented by Bru-
sadin et al. (2013), which is an updated version of the two-
infall model of Chiappini et al. (1997). The Galaxy is as-
sumed to have formed by means of two main infall episodes:
the ﬁrst formed the halo and the thick disc, the second the
thin disc. The accretion law of a certain element i at the
time t and Galactocentric distance r is deﬁned as:
A(r, t, i) = XAi (cid:0)a(r)e−t/τH (r) + b(r)e−(t−tmax)/τD (r)(cid:1) . (3)

The quantity XAi = σi(t)/σgas(t) is the abundance by mass
of the element i in the infalling material, while tmax = 1 Gyr
is the time for the maximum infall on the thin disc, τH = 0.8
Gyr is the time scale for the formation of the halo and thick-
disc and τD(r) is the timescale for the formation of the thin
disc and is a function of the galactocentric distance (inside-
out formation, Matteucci & Fran¸cois, 1989; Chiappini et al.
2001). In the 2IM model the abundances XAi show primor-
dial gas compositions and are constant in time.

Finally, the coeﬃcients a(r) and b(r) are obtained by im-
posing a ﬁt to the observed current total surface mass den-
sity in the diﬀerent considered Galactic components as a
function of the Galactocentric distance; for instance, for the
thin disc:

σ(r) = σ0e−r/rD ,

(4)

where σ0=531 M⊙ pc−2 is the central total surface mass
density and rD = 3.5 kpc is the scale length. The halo sur-
face mass density at solar position is quite uncertain and we
assume it to be 17 M⊙ pc−2 in the solar neighborhood. In
fact, the total surface mass density in the solar vicinity is ∼
71 M⊙ pc−2 (Kuijken & Gilmore 1991) with ∼ 54 M⊙ pc−2
corresponding to the disc surface mass density.

(ii) The two-infall model plus outﬂow of Brusadin et al.
(2013; in this work we will indicate it as the 2IMW model).
In this model a gas outﬂow occuring during the halo phase

c(cid:13) xxxx RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

with a rate proportional to the star formation rate through
a free parameter is considered. Following Hartwick (1976),
the outﬂow rate is deﬁned as:

dσw
dt

= −ωψ(t),

where ω is the outﬂow eﬃciency.

(5)

In Table 1 the principal characteristics of the two chem-
ical evolution models for the MW are summarized: in the
second column the infall type is indicated, in the third, and
in the fourth columns the time-scale τH of halo formation
and the time-scale τD of the thin disc formation, are drawn.
The adopted threshold in the surface gas density for the
star formation (SF) is reported in columns 5. In column 6
the exponent of the Schmidt (1959) law is shown, in columns
7 and 8 we report the star formation eﬃciency and the IMF,
respectively. Finally, in the last column the presence of the
wind is indicated in term of the eﬃciency ω.

In this work we only focus on the study of the halo
phase, investigating the eﬀects of the pre-enriched infall of
gas assuming chemical abundances taken from the outﬂow-
ing/stripped gas from dSph and UfD galaxies. We assume
that the halo phase spans the range of [Fe/H] up to -1 dex. It
is important to underline that in our model we do not mod-
ify the gas infall laws of the Brusadin et al. (2013) model,
and the way in which the Galaxy is built up remains the
same. Here, we only consider a time dependent enriched in-
fall, i.e. XAi (t), with the same chemical abundances of the
outﬂowing gas from dSph and UfD galaxies.

Concerning the observational data for the α elements
and Fe, as done in Micali et al. (2013), we employ only data
in which NLTE corrections are considered. In particular, the
data we use for Galactic Halo stars are from Gratton et al.
(2003), Cayrel et al. (2004), Akerman et al. (2004), Mashon-
kina et al. (2007) and Shi et al. (2009). For Ba we use the
data of Frebel (2010), as selected and binned by Cescutti et
al. (2013).

2.2 The dSph and UfD galaxies

To model the chemical evolution of dSph and UfD galaxies
we refer to the work of Vincenzo et al. (2014). In Tables
2 and 3 the main parameters of generic models for “classi-
cal” dSph and UfD galaxies are reported, respectively. The
star formation eﬃciency ν, the exponent k of the Kennicutt
(1998) law, and the wind eﬃciency ω are drawn in column
one, two and three, respectively. In the other columns are
reported: the infall timescale (column 4), the period of ma-
jor star formation activity in which the 99% of stars are
formed (column 5); total infall gas mass (column 6); mass
of the dark matter halo (column 7); eﬀective radius of the
luminous (baryonic) matter (column 8); ratio between the
core radius of the DM halo and the eﬀective radius of the
luminous matter (column 9); in column 10 the adopted IMF
is indicated. In column 11 the time of the onset of the galac-
tic wind is reported. In the last column we show the [Fe/H]
abundance of the peak of the predicted G-dwarf metallicity
distribution. We assume that UfD objects are characterized
by a very small star formation eﬃciency (0.01 Gyr−1) and
by an extremely short time scale of formation (0.001 Gyr).
Hence UfD objects started to form stars as most of their
infall mass, Minf = 105 M⊙, was accumulated in their DM
potential well (τinf = 0.001 Gyr) and the star formation ef-

dSph objects: tgw(dSph) < tgw(U f D). We also indicate the cu-

infall from UfDs: the green dashed dotted line and the yellow
short dashed line represent the models 2IM+UfD and 2IM+UfD
MIX, respectively. Thinner lines indicate the ISM chemical evo-
lution phases in which the SFR did not start yet in the Galactic
halo, and during which stars are no created. Models of the dSph
and UfD galaxies: The long dashed gray line represents the abun-

ﬁciency is very low (ν = 0.01 Gyr−1). Our chemical evolu-
tion model for a typical dSph galaxy assumes an infall mass
Minf = 107 M⊙, an infall timescale τinf = 0.5 Gyr, and a
star formation eﬃciency ν = 0.1 Gyr−1. Although the star
formation history (SFH) is assumed to be extended over the
entire galaxy lifetime both for the dSph and the UfD galaxy,
it is strongly concentrated in the earliest stages of the galaxy
evolution; in fact, as most of the infall mass has been accu-
mulated and the galactic wind has started, the intensity of
the SFR becomes negligible. We acknowledge that this kind
of SFR history is not representative in particular of the more
luminous dSph galaxies (e.g. Weisz et al 2014). We point out
that in the modeling the dSphs and UfDs we did not con-
sider any threshold in the gas density for star formation, as
in Vincenzo et al. (2014).

UfD models. For the dSph the galactic wind occurs at 0.013

As expected, the UfD galaxies develop a wind at later
times because of the smaller adopted star formation eﬃ-
ciency (SFE). Moreover, because of the shorter formation

we represent the model 2IM+dSph MIX. Lower panel: As in the
upper panel but considering the enriched gas from UfD galaxies.

time-scale the UfDs show the G-dwarf metallicity peak at
lower [Fe/H] values compared to dSph galaxies.

2.3 Nucleosynthesis prescriptions

In this work, we adopt the nucleosynthesis prescriptions of
Romano et al. (2010, model 15), who provide a compilation
of stellar yields able to reproduce several chemical abun-
dance patterns in the solar neighborhood. In particular, they
assume the following sets of stellar yields.

(i) For low- and intermediate-mass stars (0.8-8 M⊙), they
include the metallicity-dependent stellar yields of Karakas
(2010). For SNe Ia, the adopted nucleosynthesis prescrip-
tions are from Iwamoto et al. (1999).

(ii) For massive stars (M>8⊙), which are the progenitors
of either SNe II or HNe, depending on the explosion en-
ergy, they assume the metallicity-dependent He, C, N and
O stellar yields, as computed with the Geneva stellar evolu-
tionary code, which takes into account the combined eﬀect
of mass loss and rotation (Meynet & Maeder 2002, Hirschi
et al. 2005, Hirschi 2007, Ekstr¨om et al. 2008); for all the
elements heavier than oxygen, they assume the up-to-date
stellar evolution calculations by Kobayashi et al. (2006).

For barium, we assume the stellar yields of Cescutti et
al. (2006, model 1, table 4). In particular, Cescutti et al.
(2006) includes the metallicity-dependent stellar yields of
Ba as computed by Busso et al. (2001), in which barium is
produced by low-mass AGB stars, with mass in the range
1.0 6 M 6 3.0 M⊙, as an s-process neutron capture ele-
ment. A second channel for the Ba-production was included

by Cescutti et al. (2006), by assuming that massive stars in
their ﬁnal explosive stage are capable of synthesizing Ba as
a primary r-process element. Such r-process Ba producers
have mass in the range 12 6 M 6 30 M⊙.

We remark on the fact that the contribution to barium
from massive stars was empirically computed by Cescutti et
al. (2006), by matching the [Ba/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance
pattern as observed in the Galactic halo stars. They assumed
for massive stars the iron stellar yields of Woosley & Weaver
(1995), as corrected by Fran¸cois et al. (2004).

3 THE ENRICHED INFALL OF GAS

The novelty of this work is to take into account in a self-
i.e. XAi =
consistent way time dependent abundances,
XAi (t) instead of XAi = constant in equation (3) for the
accreting gas in the halo phase, with the values of XAi (t)
corresponding to the chemical abundances of the material
ejected from dSph and UfD galaxies by means of their galac-
tic winds. Actually, it may well be that the gas heated by SN
explosions is stored in a hot gaseous halo surrounding the
satellites, from which it is stripped owing to the interaction
with the our Galaxy. In the following, we will only mention
galactic winds for the sake of simplicity, but this alternate

option (stripping) would work equally well. The gas infall
law is the same as in the 2IM or 2IMW models and we only
consider a time dependent chemical composition of the infall
gas mass.

We take into account the enriched infall from dSph and

UfD galaxies predicted by the following 2 models:

• Model i): The infall of gas which forms the Galactic
halo is considered primordial up to the time at which the
galactic wind in dSphs (or UfDs) starts. After this moment,
the infalling gas presents the chemical abundances of the
wind. It is important to underline that for all the Galac-
tic models the gas infall laws are identical to the reference
model presented in Brusadin et al. (2013). As stressed in
the previous section, the only thing we are modifying here
is the chemical composition of the infalling gas. In Figs. we
refer to this model with the label “Name of the reference
model+dSph”or “Name of the reference model+UfD”.

• Model ii): we explore the case of a diluted infall of gas
during the MW halo phase. In particular, after the galactic
wind develops in the dSph (or UfD) galaxy, the infalling
gas has a chemical composition which, by 50 per cent, is
contributed by the dSph (or UfD) outﬂows; the remaining 50
per cent is contributed by primordial gas of a diﬀerent extra-
galactic origin (in agreement with the work of Fiorentino et

by gas of primordial chemical composition. As stated above,
in our chemical evolution model for the dSph the galactic
wind begins at 0.013 Gyr after the galaxy formation, and at
0.088 Gyr for the UfD galaxies.

4 THE RESULTS

In this section, we present the results of our chemical evolu-
tion models for the Galactic halo, by assuming that either

• A) all the stars of the Galactic halo were born in situ

in dSph galaxies

• B) the Galactic halo formed by accretion of pre-enriched
material, originating in dSphs and UfDs (Model i). We ex-
plore also the case in which the infalling enriched material
is diluted by pristine gas of diﬀerent extra-galactic origin
(Model ii).

We divide the results in two separate subsections, ac-
cording to the MW chemical evolution model which is as-
sumed, namely the 2IM (two-infall) or the 2IMW (two infall
plus outﬂow) models. It is important to stress out that the
models follow the chemical abundances in the ISM and we
compare our predictions with stellar abundances under the
assumption that their atmospheres reﬂect the abundances
of the ISM out of which they formed.

4.1 The Results: the Galactic halo in the model

2IM

In Fig. 3, the predicted [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance pat-
terns are compared with the observed data in Galactic halo
stars. In order to directly test the hypothesis that Galac-
tic halo stars have been stripped from dSph or UfD sys-
tems, we show the predictions of chemical evolution models
for a typical dSph and UfD galaxy (long dashed lines in
grey and black, respectively). The two models cannot ex-
plain the [α/Fe] plateau which Galactic halo stars exhibit
for [Fe/H] & −2.0 dex; in fact, halo stars have always larger
[O/Fe] ratios than dSph and UfD stars.

Moreover, in Fig. 3 we show the eﬀects of the enriched
infall with chemical abundances taken by the outﬂowing gas
from dSph and Ufd objects on the [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H] rela-
tion. In particular, we compare the reference 2IM model for
the Galactic Halo (which assumes primordial infall) with
the “2IM+dSph” and “2IM+UfD” models (enriched infall
following Model i) and ii) prescriptions, respectively); in
the same ﬁgure, we show also the “2IM+ dSph MIX” and
“2IM+UfD MIX” models, with chemical abundances of the
outﬂowing gas from dSph and UfD being diluted with pri-
mordial ones.

First we analyze the results with the enriched infall
coming from dSph galaxies. We see that for oxygen we ob-
tain a better agreement with the data in the halo phase when
we consider the enriched infall models. We recall that a key
ingredient of the 2IM model is the presence of a threshold
in the gas density in the star formation (SF) ﬁxed at 4 M⊙
pc−2 in the Halo-thick disc phase. During the halo phase
such a critical threshold is reached only at t = 0.356 Gyr
from the Galaxy formation. On the other hand, when in-
cluding the environmental eﬀect, we have to consider also

al. 2015). As stated above, the infall law follows the one
assumed in the 2IM or 2IMW models presented in Brusadin
et al. (2013). In all the successive ﬁgures and in the text,
we refer to these models with the labels “Name of the MW
model+dSph (or UfD) MIX”.

In the two upper panels of Fig. 1, we show the evolution
in time of the chemical composition of the outﬂowing gas
from the dSph and the UfD galaxy for O, Mg, Si, Ba and Fe.
It is worth noting that in the outﬂows from UfD galaxies the
Fe and Si abundances are larger than in the outﬂows from
dSphs.

We recall that Fe is mostly produced by Type Ia SNe
and Si is also produced in a non negligible amount by the
same SNe. Because in our models the ratio between the time
scale of formation between UfD and dSph is extremy low
(τinf (UfD)/τinf (dSph)=2 × 10−3, at later times the pol-
lution from Type IA SN is more evident in the UfD out-
ﬂow. As shown in Tables 2 and 3, in UfDs the onset of the
wind happens at later times compared with dSph objects:
tgw(dSph) < tgw(U f D).

In the two lower panels the [X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abun-
dance patterns are presented, where X corresponds to O,
Mg, Si, and Ba.

In Fig. 2 is shown the [O/Fe] ratio as a function of
[Fe/H] in the galactic wind of a classical dSph galaxy with
characteristics described in Table 2, and compared with the
“MIX” case where the abundances are diluted by 50 per cent

the time for the onset of the galactic wind, which in the
dSph model occurs at tgw = 0.013 Gyr.

Therefore, the SF begins after 0.356 Gyr from the be-
ginning of Galaxy formation, and this fact explains the be-
havior of the curves with enriched infalls in Fig. 3: during
the ﬁrst 0.356 Gyr in both “2IM+dSph” and “2IM+dSph
MIX” models, no stars are created, and the chemical evolu-
tion is traced by the exponential gas accretion with a time
dependent chemical enrichment (eq. 3).

In Fig. 3 and in all the successive ﬁgures we indicate
with thinner lines the ISM chemical evolution phases in
which the SFR did not start yet in the Galactic halo, and
during which stars are no created.

To summarize, for the model “2IM+dSph” we distin-
guish three diﬀerent phases in the halo chemical evolution:

• Phase 1): 0-0.013 Gyr, the infall is primordial, the wind

in dSphs has not started yet, and there is no SF;

• Phase 2): 0.013-0.356 Gyr, the infall

is enriched by

dSphs, the SFR is zero in this phase;

• Phase 3): 0.356-1 Gyr; the infall is enriched by dSphs,

the SFR is diﬀerent from zero.

During phase 3), the SF takes over, and increases the
[O/Fe] values because of the pollution from massive stars on
short time-scales.

We note that the entire spread of the data cannot be ex-
plained assuming a time dependent enriched infall with the
same abundances of the outﬂowing gas from dSph galaxies,
even if there is a better agreement with the halo data in
comparison to the model with primordial infall.

It is important to underline that, until the SF is non-
zero, no stars are created; however, since our models follow
the chemical abundances in the gas phase, the solely con-
tribution to the ISM chemical evolution before SF begins is
due to the time dependent enriched infall. It means that in

Figure 10. The abundance ratio [Si/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H]

the “2IM+dSph” model the ﬁrst stars that are formed have
[Fe/H] values larger than -2.4 dex.

In this case, to explain data for stars with [Fe/H] smaller
than -2.4 dex we need stars formed in dSph systems (see the
model curve of the chemical evolution of dSph galaxies).

Concerning the results with the enriched infall from
UfD outﬂow abundances, we recall here that in our refer-
ence model for UfD galaxies, the wind starts at 0.08 Gyr.
The model results for the halo still reproduce the data but
with the same above mentioned caveat.

The chemical evolution of the Galactic halo

9

In Figs. 5 and 6, we show the results of all our chem-
ical evolution models with the 2IM scenario for the [Si/Fe]
and [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance patterns, respectively.
The various curves with diﬀerent colors represent the same
chemical evolution models as in Fig. 3. As concluded for
the [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance diagram, our reference
chemical evolution models for dSph and UfD galaxies can-
not explain the observed Galactic halo data over the entire
range of [Fe/H] abundances. This rules out the hypothesis
that all Galactic halo stars were stripped or accreted in the
past from dSphs or UfDs. This result is in agreement with
previous works in the literature as the ones of Unavane at
al. (1996) and Venn et al. (2004). On the other hand, as
stated above, if we assume that the Galactic halo formed
by accreting enriched gas from dSphs or UfDs, we also need
a stellar contribution from dSphs and UfDs to explain the
stars at very low [Fe/H] that currently reside in the halo.

It is worth noting that for the α elements studied in this
work, all models predictionsincluding the enriched infall of
gas, tend to the [α/Fe] values of the reference model for high
[Fe/H] in the halo phase. This is due to the fact that when
the SF is active the pollution from dying stars overcomes
the enriched infall eﬀects.

We note that a diﬀerent value of the threshold in the
MW model would modify the duration of the phase 2). In
this work, we did not explore diﬀerent values of the threshold
in the halo, our aim being to test the eﬀects of the enriched
infall on chemical evolution models of the MW, which are
able to reproduce the majority of the observations in the
solar neighborhood and also the abundance gradients along
the disk. As shown in Mott et al. (2013), if we do not take
into account radial gas ﬂows (Portinari & Chiosi 2000, Spi-
toni & Matteucci 2013, Cavichia et al. 2014) a threshold in
the gas density is required to explain the abundance gradi-
ents along the Galactic disk, and in particular the values of
4 M⊙ pc−2 in the halo phase and 7 M⊙ pc−2 in the thin disk
phase, provide a very good agreement with the data.

In Fig. 7, we show the results for the [Ba/Fe] versus
[Fe/H] abundance diagram. The observational data are from
Frebel et al. (2010), as selected and binned by Cescutti et
al. (2013). By looking at the ﬁgure, the 2IM model does
not provide a good agreement with the observed data-set
for [Fe/H] < −2.5 dex. The initial increasing trend of the
[Ba/Fe] ratios in the 2IM model is due to the contribution
of the ﬁrst Ba-producers, which are massive stars with mass
in the range 12-30 M⊙.

By looking at Fig. 7, one can also appreciate that our
chemical evolution models for dSphs and UfDs fail in re-
producing the observed data, since they predict the [Ba/Fe]
ratios to increase at much lower [Fe/H] abundances than the
observed data. Concerning the chemical evolution of the Ba
for dSphs, our predictions are in agreement with Lanfranchi
et al. (2008), where they compared the evolution of s- and
r- process elements in our Galaxy with that in dSph galax-
ies. That is due to the very low SFEs assumed for dSphs
and UfDs, which cause the ﬁrst Ba-polluters to enrich the
ISM at extremely low [Fe/H] abundances. The subsequent
decrease of the [Ba/Fe] ratios is due to the large iron con-
tent deposited by Type Ia SNe in the ISM, which happens at
still very low [Fe/H] abundances in dSphs and UfDs. Hence,
in the range −3.5 . [Fe/H] . −2.5 dex, while Galactic halo
stars exhibit an increasing trend of the [Ba/Fe] versus [Fe/H]

In Fig. 4 we show the time evolution of oxygen abun-
dances for the model 2IM (primordial infall), 2IM+dSph,
2IM+dSph MIX, 2IM+UfD, and 2IM+UfD MIX. We no-
tice that the reference model 2IM, as explained before, shows
chemical evolution after t=0.356 Gyr, and the models with
enriched infalls which show the fastest chemical enrichment
are the ones with infall abundances taken from the outﬂows
of dSph objects, because the galactic winds occur earlier
than in UfD systems.

abundance ratio pattern, UfD stars show a decreasing trend
(see also Koch et al. 2013).

In Fig. 7, all our models involving an enriched infall
from dSphs and UfDs deviate substantially from the ob-
served trend of the [Ba/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance pat-
tern in Galactic halo stars. Such a discrepancy enlarges for
[Fe/H] < −2.4 dex, where those models predict always larger
[Ba/Fe] ratios than the 2IM model.

4.2 The Results: the Galactic halo in the model

2IMW

In this subsection we show the results when the time depen-
dent enriched infall is applied to the reference model 2IMW.
In Fig. 8 we show the results in terms of [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H]
in the solar neighborhood.

in the halo phase is characterized by an outﬂow gas rate pro-
portional to the SFR and by a smaller formation timescale
τH than the one of the model 2IM (see Table 1). A shorter
formation time-scale leads to a faster chemical evolution at
the early times. In fact, as shown in Fig. 2 of Brusadin et al.
(2013), the SFR starts at 0.05 Gyr, since the critical thresh-
old in the surface gas density is reached earlier.

As done above, for the model “2IMW+dSph” we distin-
guish three diﬀerent phases in the halo chemical evolution:

• Phase 1): 0-0.013 Gyr, the infall is primordial, the wind
in dSphs has not started yet and there is no star formation;
is enriched by

• Phase 2): 0.013-0.05 Gyr, the infall

dSphs, the SFR is zero in this phase;

• Phase 3): 0.05- 1 Gyr; the infall is enriched by dSphs,

the SFR is diﬀerent from zero.

As mentioned in Section 2, the reference model 2IMW

On one hand, comparing model “2IMW+dSph” in Fig.

c(cid:13) xxxx RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

8 with model “2IM+dSph” in Fig. 3, we can see that the
former shows a shorter phase 2) than the latter.

On the other hand, comparing model “2IMW+UfD” in
Fig. 8 with model “2IM+UfD” in Fig. 3, we see that the
former overlap to the reference model 2IMW at almost all
[Fe/H] abundances. In fact, since in the UfD galactic model
the wind starts at 0.088 Gyr and, at this instant, in the
model 2IMW the SF is already active (the SF activity be-
gins at 0.05 Gyr), the phase 2) evolution (namely, chemi-
cal evolution without SF) is not present in the 2IMW+UfD
model. Therefore the eﬀect of the enriched infall is almost
negligible compared to the pollution of chemical elements
produced by dying halo stars, since we cannot distinguish
between the eﬀect of an enriched infall from UfDs and the
chemical feedback provided by the Type II SNe originated
in the Galactic halo itself.

This can also be appreciated by looking at Fig. 9, where
the time evolution of the oxygen abundances of the model
2IMW, and in presence of enriched infall from UfD and dSph
galaxies are shown. We see that for the UfD case the model
with enriched infall is almost identical to the reference model
2IMW.

In Figs. 10 and 11 model results for [Si/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]
and [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] in the solar neighborhood are pre-
sented, respectively. As for oxygen the eﬀect of the enriched
infall from UfD galaxies is almost negligible compared to
the pollution of chemical elements produced by dying halo
stars.

Concerning the [Ba/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance pat-
tern, in Fig. 12 we compare the predictions of our mod-
els with the Galactic halo data. We notice that the 2IMW
model provides now a better agreement with the observed
data than the 2IM model, although the predicted [Ba/Fe] ra-
tios at [Fe/H] < −3 dex still lie below the observed data. On
the other hand, by assuming an enriched infall from dSph
or UfD galaxies, the predicted [Ba/Fe] ratios agree with the
observed data also at [Fe/H] < −3 dex. In conclusion, in
order to reproduce the observed [Ba/Fe] ratios over the en-
tire range of [Fe/H] abundances, a time-dependent enriched
infall in the Galactic halo phase is required. We are aware
that for Ba more detailed data are needed, therefore at this
stage we cannot draw ﬁrm conclusions.

We note that in general [α/Fe] ratios in dSphs and UfDs
can overlap with those of halo stars at very low metallicity
where in all galaxies the chemical enrichment is dominated
by the nucleosynthesis of core collapse SNe.

This makes diﬃcult to test whether some stars from
dwarf satellites have indeed been accreted by the halo.
Rather, it is likely that a fraction as high as 50% of the
gas out of which the halo formed has been shed by its satel-
lite systems, whose relics we see (in part) nowadays, devoid
of their gas. This is only valid for satellite systems with a
very short duration of star formation, as modelled in this
paper. More realistic SFH would create ejected gas with low
[α/Fe] (as seen in the stars in the surviving luminous dSph)
and conﬂict with the data for halo stars.

On the other hand, we have identiﬁed in the [Ba/Fe]
ratios a better discriminant of the origin of halo stars. The
diﬀerences predicted for the dwarf galaxies relative to the
halo suggest that it is unlikely that the dSphs and UfDs
have been the building blocks of the halo.

In Fig. 13 we show the predicted G-dwarf distributions

c(cid:13) xxxx RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

The chemical evolution of the Galactic halo

in terms of [Fe/H] for models of Figs. 3 and 8. Our predic-
tions have been convolved with a Gaussian with an error of
0.2 dex. As pointed out by Brusadin et al. (2013), the ref-
erence model 2IM is not able to reproduce the peak of the
distribution. Only assuming a shorter formation time-scale
coupled with a gas outﬂow event in the Galactic halo chem-
ical evolution (model 2IMW) we are able to properly ﬁt the
observed distribution. Anyway, in both cases the enriched
infall of gas from dSph and UfD objects does not aﬀect the
distributions. In Fig. 14 the G-dwarf distribution is shown
as a function of the [O/Fe] ratio. Here, both models 2IM and
2IMW, including the enriched infall models show the peak
at 0.5 dex.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we ﬁrst have explored the hypothesis that
dSph and UfD galaxies are the survived building blocks of
the Galactic halo, by assuming that the halo formed by ac-
cretion of stars belonging to these galaxies.

Then, we have presented a diﬀerent scenario in which
the Galactic halo formed by accretion of enriched gas with
the same chemical composition as the outﬂowing gas from
dSphs and UfDs. Finally, we have tested the eﬀect of diluting
the infalling material from dSphs or UfDs with primordial
gas of diﬀerent extra-galactic origin.

Our main conclusions can be summarized as follows:

(i) We ﬁnd that the predicted [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abun-
dance patterns of UfD and dSph chemical evolution models
deviate substantially from the observed data of the Galac-
tic halo stars only for [Fe/H] values larger than -2 dex; this
means that at those metallicities the chemical evolution of
the Galactic halo was diﬀerent than in the satellite galax-
ies. On the other hand, we notice that for Ba the chemical
evolution models of dSphs and UfDs fail to reproduce the
observational observed data of the Galactic halo stars over
the whole range of [Fe/H].

(ii) We can safely rule out the hypothesis that the stellar
halo of the MW entirely formed from the merging of galaxies
which were the ancestors of the current dSphs and UfDs.
Our results are in agreement with the previous suggestions of
Unavane et al. (1996) and Venn et al. (2004). We cannot rule
out, however, the hypothesis that a substantial contribution
to the formation of the Galaxy stellar halo was provided by a
population of dwarf galaxies which were more massive and
more evolved from the point of view of the ISM chemical
evolution than the current dSphs and UfDs.

(iii) Concerning the chemical evolution models for the
MW in the presence of enriched gas infall we obtain that:
the eﬀects on the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] plots depend on the
infall time scale for the formation of the halo and the pres-
ence of a gas threshold in the star formation. In fact, the
most evident eﬀects are present for the model 2IM, charac-
terized by the longest time scale of formation (0.8 Gyr), and
the longest period without star formation activity among all
models presented here.

(iv) In general, the enriched infall by itself is not capable
to explain the observational spread in the halo data at low
[Fe/H], in the [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] plots. Moreover, in the
presence of an enriched infall we need stars produced in situ

12

Spitoni et al.

in dSph or UfD objects and accreted later to the Galactic
halo, to explain the data at lowest [Fe/H] values.

(v) The optimal element to test diﬀerent theories of halo
formation is barium which is (relatively) easily measured in
low-metallicity stars. In fact, we have shown that the pre-
dicted [Ba/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relation in dSphs and UfDs
is quite diﬀerent than in the Galactic halo. Moreover, the
[Ba/Fe] ratio can be substantially inﬂuenced by the assump-
tion of an enriched infall. In particular, the two infall plus
outﬂow model can better reproduce the data in the whole
range of [Fe/H] abundances, and this is especially true if
a time dependent enriched infall during the halo phase is
assumed.
