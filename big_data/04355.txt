The decay mode B → K∗(cid:96)+(cid:96)− is one of the most promising modes to probe physics beyond the
standard model (SM), since the angular distribution of the decay products enable measurement of
several constraining observables. LHCb has recently measured these observables using 3 fb−1 of data
as a binned function of q2, the dilepton invariant mass squared. We show that LHCb data implies
a 5σ overall signal for new physics and provides unambiguous evidence for right-handed currents,
which are absent in the SM. These conclusions are derived in the maximum q2 limit and are free
from hadronic corrections. Our approach diﬀers from other approaches that probe new physics at
low q2 as it does not require estimates of hadronic parameters but relies instead on heavy quark
symmetries that are reliable at the maximum q2 kinematic endpoint.

The rare decay B → K∗(cid:96)+(cid:96)−, which involves a b → s
ﬂavor changing loop induced quark transition at the
quark level, provides an indirect but very sensitive probe
of new physics (NP) beyond the standard model (SM).
The angular distribution of the decay products provides
a large number of observables [1] and thus can be used
to reduce hadronic uncertainties making the mode a very
special tool to probe for NP. Signiﬁcant work has been
done to probe NP in this mode. Most previous at-
tempts have focused [2] on the low dilepton invariant
mass squared region q2 = 1− 6 GeV2. An alternative ap-
proach that probes the maximum q2 limit has also been
studied in literature [3, 4]. We show that this limit holds
signiﬁcant promise for clean probes of NP. A previous
study suggested a possible signal of NP in the large q2
region [5]. In this letter we show that LHCb data implies
a 5σ signal for the existence of NP. While the evidence for
right handed currents is unambiguous, other NP contri-
butions are also possible. Our conclusions are derived in
the maximum q2 limit (q2
max) and are free from hadronic
corrections. Our approach diﬀers from other approaches
that probe NP at low q2 by not requiring estimates of
hadronic parameters but relying instead on heavy quark
symmetries that are highly reliable at the kinematic end-
point q2
max [3, 6]. While the observables themselves re-
main unaltered from their SM values, their derivatives
and second derivatives at the endpoint are sensitive to
NP eﬀects.
The decay B → K∗(cid:96)+(cid:96)− is described by six transver-

sity amplitudes that can be written as [7]

decay distribution in this kinematic limit must be inde-
pendent of the angles θ(cid:96) and φ, which can be integrated
out. This imposes constraints on the amplitude AL,R
and hence the observables. The entire decay, including
the decay K∗ → Kπ takes place in one plane, resulting
in a vanishing contribution to the ‘⊥’ helicity, or F⊥ = 0.
Since the K∗ decays at rest, the distribution of Kπ is
isotropic and cannot depend on θK. It can easily be seen
that this is only possible if F(cid:107) = 2FL [6].

described above result in unique values of the helicity

point. The values of the helicity fractions and asymme-
tries were derived in Ref. [6, 7] where it is explicitly shown
that

r such that r0 = r(cid:107) = r⊥ ≡ r [13]. Therefore Eq. (18)
implies that in the presence of RH currents one should
expect R0 = R(cid:107) (cid:54)= R⊥ at q2 = q2
max without any ap-
proximation. Interestingly, this relation is unaltered by
non-factorizable and resonance contributions [6] at this
kinematic endpoint.
We study the values of Rλ, ζ and P1,2 in the large
q2 region and consider the kinematic limit q2 → q2
max.
It is easy to see from Eq. (13) that F⊥(q2
max) = 0 im-
plies that ζ = 0 in the limit q2 → q2
max. Further, since
R(cid:107)(q2
max), Eqs. (14) and (15) imply that in the
limit q2 → q2

go to zero at q2
max. It is therefore imperative that we take
into account the limiting values very carefully by Taylor
expanding all observables around the endpoint q2
max in
terms of the variable δ ≡ q2
max − q2. The leading power
of δ in the Taylor expansion must take into account the
relative momentum dependence of the amplitudes AL,R
.
From Eq. (6) one ﬁnds that the leading term in FL and
F(cid:107) must be O(δ0), whereas the leading term for F⊥ is
O(δ). The leading terms for the asymmetries, A5 and
√
AFB, are O(
δ). Hence, we expand the observables as

FIG. 1. An analytic ﬁt to 14-bin LHCb data for the observ-

The ±1σ error bands are indicated by the light blue shaded

LHCb 14-bin and 8-bin measurements [14], respectively.

We ﬁt the latest LHCb measurements [14] of the ob-
servables FL, F⊥, AFB and A5 as functions of q2 over
the entire range. The ﬁts were performed by minimiz-
ing the χ2 function, which compares the bin integrated
values of q2 functions of the observables with their mea-
sured experimental values for all 14 bins. We use the 14
bin data set based on the method of moments [15] from
LHCb rather than the 8 bin data set as it enables better
constraints near q2
max. The best ﬁt values for each coeﬃ-
cient of the observables FL, F⊥, AFB and A5 (Eqs. (25)–
(28)) are given in Table I. The errors in each coeﬃcient
are evaluated using a covariance matrix technique.
In
addition to considering the endpoint constraints given in
Eq. (23) we have also imposed the constraints on observ-
ables at q2 = 4 m2
min, which were derived in Ref. [7].
The symmetry of the angular distribution implies that
all asymmetries i.e A4, A5, AFB, A7, A8 and A9 must
vanish in this limit and due to the absence of a preferred
direction, all three helicity fractions are equally probable,
i.e. FL = F⊥ = F(cid:107) = 1

large value of R⊥ and a small value of R(cid:107) as can be seen
from Eqs. (30) and (31). This eﬀect can only be com-
pensated if ω2 (cid:117) ω1. However, ω2 can take much larger
values than ω1, as it has a large error. The large values
of AFB and A5, which do not rapidly approach zero in
the neighborhood of q2
max, indicate a deviation from the
SM.

to 1σ and 5σ conﬁdence levels for ∆ = 0.4. The orange and
blue contours represent the 5σ conﬁdence regions for ∆ = 0.5
and 0.8, respectively. Only the region bounded by the black

ω1 ≥ 1 (See text for details).

ﬁnd a slope that is nearly 0o, indicating that R⊥ (cid:29) R(cid:107),0.
The deviation of slope from a 45o provides evidence of a
contribution from RH currents.

In an alternate approach we ﬁt the values of R⊥ and
R(cid:107),0 with the two estimated values of ω1 and ω2 by mini-
mizing a χ2 function. Since the central value of ω1 is less
than 1, there is a technical diﬃculty with this approach.
This unphysical value of ω1 is a 2σ eﬀect that could be a
statistical ﬂuctuation in the measurement or could arise
due to some additional NP. We do not distinguish be-
tween the two and simply add a parameter ∆ to ω1 by
redeﬁning ω1 → ω1 + ∆.

The allowed regions in the R⊥ – R(cid:107),0 plane correspond-
ing to diﬀerent values of ∆ are shown in Fig. 2. The solid
red straight line on the far left corresponds to the case
R⊥ = R(cid:107),0. The SM value is indicated by the star on the
red line. The black hyperbolic curve represents an abso-
lute bound corresponding to ω1 = ω2 = 1. As ω1 ≥ 1,
only the region below the hyperbolic curve is allowed.
The region to the left of R⊥ = 0 and below R(cid:107),0 = 0
line is excluded if large ξ and ξ(cid:48) are not allowed. The
light gray and dark gray contours denote the 1σ and 5σ
permitted regions for ∆ = 0.4. The orange and blue con-
tours are 5σ conﬁdence level regions for ∆ = 0.5 and 0.8,
respectively. The best ﬁt values for ∆ = 0.4, 0.5 and 0.8
are shown by grey, orange and blue points, respectively.
We emphasize that for SM the contours should be aligned
along the 45o line. The alignment of contours away from
the SM expectation is a signal for RH currents.

The contributions from resonances alter only the value
of the C9 at a given q2 through the ∆C9 correc-
tion(Eq.(2)). These resonances can in principle introduce
errors in the ﬁt values obtained in Table I, since only q2
bin averaged values of the observables are measured and
details of resonances are averaged over. Nevertheless, the
slope of the contours are unaltered since resonances con-
tribute equally to all helicities. Hence we conclude the
contribution from resonances cannot be misinterpreted
as the presence of RH currents.

Having established the existence of RH contributions,
we perform a χ2 ﬁt to the parameters ξ and ξ(cid:48) which
indicate the size of the new Wilson coeﬃcients. This
is easily done using Eqs. (18), (30) and (31). However,
this requires as an input the SM estimate of r/C10 =
0.84 from Eq. (24) at q2
max. The allowed regions in the
ξ – ξ(cid:48) plane for diﬀerent ∆ values are shown in Fig. 3.
The best ﬁt values of ξ and ξ(cid:48), for ∆ = 0.4, with ±1σ
errors are −0.71 ± 0.45 and −0.87 ± 0.19, respectively.
The yellow, orange and red bands denote 1σ, 3σ and
5σ conﬁdence level regions, respectively, for ∆ = 0.4.
The dark and light blue contours correspond to the 5σ
region for ∆ = 0.5 and ∆ = 0.8, respectively. Each
dot in the corresponding color is the best ﬁt point and
the SM value of C(cid:48)
9/C10 is indicated by

Only the region bounded by the black dashed curves is
physically allowed from the constraint ω2 ≥ ω1 ≥ 1. The
SM estimate of r/C10 can have uncertainties that cannot
easily be accounted for. These could range from errors in

physics or even the contributions from resonances.
In
order to ascertain the accuracy of our conclusion to these
uncertainties, we have scanned [16] r/C10 over a range of
values. While the evidence for right handed currents is
unambiguous, the central values of ξ and ξ(cid:48) obtained from
the ﬁt can be reduced somewhat if r/C10 is smaller due to
NP contributions that alter the Wilson coeﬃcient C9. We
note that if ξ (cid:54)= 0 is conﬁrmed by further measurements,
additional scalar and or pseudoscalar contributions would
be needed in order to have consistency with Bs → µ+µ−
data [17].

10/C10 – C(cid:48)

FIG. 3. Allowed regions in C(cid:48)
9/C10 plane for dif-
ferent ∆ values are shown. The yellow, orange and red bands
are the 1σ, 3σ and 5σ conﬁdence level regions, respectively,
for ∆ = 0.4. The dark and light blue contours correspond to
5σ region for ∆ = 0.5 and ∆ = 0.8 respectively. Each dot in
the corresponding color is the best ﬁt point; the SM values of
C(cid:48)
10/C10 and C(cid:48)
9/C10 are indicated by a ‘star’, which sits on
the 5σ conﬁdence level contour. Only the region bounded by
the black dashed curves is physically allowed from the con-
straint ω2 ≥ ω1 ≥ 1 (See text for details).

We now incorporate the complex part of the transver-
sity amplitudes i.e ελ contributions (in Eq. (3)), which
was not considered so far.
In our approach ελ can be
estimated at the endpoint purely from data. The ελ cor-
rections do not contribute to the asymmetries AFB and
A5, however, they do contribute to the helicity fractions
FL and F⊥ [7].
Interestingly, in a Taylor expansion of

(cid:98)ελ ≡ 2|ελ|2/Γf , the coeﬃcient of the leading term must
be positive. We have used LHCb data to estimate (cid:98)ε(0)
and (cid:98)ε(1)⊥ that modify the estimates of ω1 and
(cid:98)ε(1)
0 , (cid:98)ε(1)(cid:107)

ω2. Including these eﬀects we ﬁnd that our conclusions
are very slightly strengthened [16].

In conclusion, we have shown how RH currents can be
uniquely probed without any hadronic approximations
at q2
max. Our approach diﬀers from other approaches that
probe new physics at low q2, as it does not require esti-
mates of hadronic parameters but relies instead on heavy
quark symmetry based arguments that are reliable at
q2
max [3, 4]. While the observables themselves remain un-
altered from their SM values, their derivatives and second
derivatives at the end point are sensitive to NP eﬀects.
Large values of AFB and A5, which do not rapidly ap-
proach zero in the neighborhood of q2
max, are indicative
of NP eﬀects. We show that LHCb data implies 5σ evi-
dence of NP at q2
max. While the signal for right handed
currents is unambiguous, the large central values of ξ and
ξ(cid:48) obtained will be reduced if other NP contributions are
present.

[8] The lepton mass corrections can easily be included as
shown in Ref. [7]. However the corrections are negligible
at large q2.
