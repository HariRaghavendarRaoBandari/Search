Abstract

We suggest an analogy between energetic particle and magnetic ﬁeld observations made by the Voyager 1 spacecraft
in the distant heliosheath at 122 AU in August 2012, and those made in the distant geomagnetic tail by the ISEE 3
spacecraft in 1982–1983, despite large diﬀerences in the time and distance scales. The analogy suggests that in August,
2012, Voyager 1 may not have moved from the anomalous cosmic ray (ACR)-dominated heliosheath into the interstellar
medium but into a region equivalent to the “lobes” of the geomagnetic tail, composed of heliospheric ﬁeld lines which
have reconnected with the interstellar medium beyond the spacecraft and so are open to the entry of cosmic rays,
while heliospheric particles (e.g., ACRs) are free to escape, and which maintain a ∼Parker spiral conﬁguration. The
heliopause, analogous to the magnetopause forming the outer boundary of the lobes, may then lie beyond this so-called
“heliocliﬀ”. Even if this analogy is incorrect, the remarkable similarities between the energetic particle and magnetic
ﬁeld observations in these very diﬀerent regions are worth noting.

1. Introduction – Voyager Observations

Observations made by the Voyager 1 (V1) spacecraft
in the distant heliosheath at 122 AU in August 2012, illus-
trated in the bottom part of Figure 1 (Burlaga et al., 2013),
showed unanticipated dramatic, abrupt, temporary de-
creases in the intensity of “anomalous” cosmic rays (ACRs;
bottom panel of the V1 observations) after several years
of near-constant intensities as the spacecraft crossed the
heliosheath, followed by a precipitous and persistent de-
crease (Krimigis et al., 2013). The temporary decreases in
ACR intensity were accompanied by temporary increases
in the intensity of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs; not illus-
trated here), with a persistent GCR enhancement com-
mencing at the ﬁnal ACR decrease (Stone et al., 2013).
There were also temporary increases in the magnetic ﬁeld
strength at the times of the ACR decreases/GCR increases
(upper panel of the V1 observations in Figure 1), with
a ﬁnal and persistent increase of the ﬁeld strength com-
mencing at the ﬁnal ACR decrease (right-hand vertical
solid line). Burlaga et al. (2013) reported that the mag-
netic ﬁeld direction showed little change at the time of
the ACR and GCR variations, remaining closely aligned
with the ±T (transverse) direction expected for the helio-
spheric magnetic ﬁeld. This observation suggests that the

ﬁnal, dramatic change in the particles and magnetic ﬁelds
– the “heliocliﬀ” – was not the much-anticipated cross-
ing of the heliopause into the interstellar medium (ISM),
where a diﬀerent ﬁeld orientation would be expected. On
the other hand, V1 plasma wave observations (Gurnett et
al., 2013) indicate relatively high plasma densities outside
the heliocliﬀ (V1 does not have an operating plasma in-
strument) that are consistent with those expected in the
ISM, leading the Voyager team to conclude that V1 did in
fact cross the heliopause in August, 2012. This view has
been challenged by Fisk & Gloeckler (2014) and Gloeckler
& Fisk (2015), who suggest that these high densities are
instead associated with compressed solar wind and that
the heliopause has yet to be reached.

The intent of this paper is simply to point out some in-
teresting similarities between the V1 observations in Au-
gust 2012 and energetic ion and magnetic ﬁeld observa-
tions made during the exploration of the distant (≤ 200Re)
geomagnetic tail by the ISEE 3 spacecraft in 1982–1983
(Tsurutani & von Rosenvinge, 1984), albeit at vastly dif-
ferent temporal (days vs. minutes) and spatial (AU vs.
Re) scales. The similarities suggest that V1 may still be
in the heliosphere following the heliocliﬀ.

made when the spacecraft was 213 Re downtail from Earth.
This is based on Figure 6 of Owen et al. (1991b) but that
ﬁgure has been ﬂipped from right to left (i.e., the time axis
is reversed) to compare better with the V1 observations in
the bottom part of Figure 1. To place the ISEE-3 observa-
tions in context, Figure 2 shows a simple schematic of the
magnetotail (adapted from Hughes (1995)) that is suﬃ-
cient for the purposes of this paper. The tail consists ﬁrst
of two “lobes” composed of magnetic ﬁeld lines (numbered
5 and 5’) that are connected to the Earth at one end and
are open to the solar wind at the other. These ﬁeld lines
have previously reconnected with the interplanetary mag-
netic ﬁeld (IMF) at the dayside (ﬁeld line 1’; a southward
IMF, favorable for reconnection, is shown) before being
dragged over the polar caps into the tail (2, 3, 4, 2’, 3’,
4’) by the solar wind ﬂow past the Earth (Dungey, 1961),
which also aligns the lobe ﬁeld lines along the tail. The
north and south tail lobes are separated by a plasma sheet
(hatched region in Figure 2) formed by the reconnection
of lobe ﬁeld lines at a neutral line. Field lines 6 and 6’
map to the neutral line, as do the equivalent ﬁeld lines
downtail from the neutral line. Plasma accelerated at the
neutral line ﬂows away from the neutral line both toward
the Earth and down the tail.
In the deep tail, ISEE–3
was usually tailward of the neutral line and observed pre-
dominantly tailward ﬂows in the plasma sheet (Zwickl et
al., 1984). In the plasma sheet, thermal plasma pressure
is dominant, and the magnetic ﬁeld is weak and variable
in direction. Finally, the magnetopause (MP) marks the
boundary between the lobes and the ambient solar wind
which has passed through the bow shock and is not con-
nected to the magnetosphere. Dynamical processes in the
tail also occur, such as the formation of plasmoids during
substorms which were detected by ISEE-3 in the deep tail
(e.g., Richardson & Cowley (1985), Moldwin & Hughes
(1992)). See Sergeev et al. (2012) for a recent review of
substorm dynamics.

When in the deep tail, ISEE-3 sampled diﬀerent struc-
tures as the tail moved across the spacecraft due to tail
dynamics and ﬂapping of the tail in response to changes
in the solar wind velocity (Hones et al., 1986). During the
(very typical) two-hour period illustrated in the top part
of Figure 1, ISEE-3 was in the plasma sheet to the left of
the ﬁrst dashed vertical line, characterized by a magnetic
ﬁeld that is variable in intensity and direction (the bottom
three panels in the top part of the ﬁgure show the magnetic
ﬁeld strength and polar and azimuthal angles in GSE co-
ordinates), and by a population of energetic ions observed
by EPAS; direction-averaged intensities in the three lowest
EPAS energy channels (35-56, 59-91 and 91-147 keV total
energy) are shown in the top panel. The third panel shows
35-56 keV ion intensities from EPAS telescope 2 (inclined
at 30o from the ecliptic) in various ﬂow directions (see
Owen et al. (1991b) for further details). Also illustrated
are sample pie plots of particle counts accumulated in 64
s intervals in the 8 azimuthal sectors of this telescope as
the spacecraft rotated about a spin axis oriented perpen-

and magnetic ﬁeld observations (top part; adapted from Owen et al.
[1991b]) for 09-11 UT on January 26, 1983 at 213 Re downtail, but
with the time axis reversed in order to illustrate the similarity of
particle intensity and magnetic ﬁeld variations at the plasma sheet-
lobe transition and those observed by V1 at the heliocliﬀ (bottom
part; Burlaga et al.
[2013]). Sectored particle distributions peaked
perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld direction are seen both in the low
intensity particles in the lobe and ∼ 20 days following the heliocliﬀ
at V1 (Krimigis et al., 2013). A crossing of the magnetopause from
the lobe to the magnetosheath is also shown at ISEE-3. Additional
details are given in the text.

moving Earthward), leaving a small remnant population
of ∼ 90o pitch angle ions which is relatively stable in the
low variance lobe ﬁelds.

In the right-hand period of the ISEE-3 observations
in Figure 1, ISEE-3 has crossed the MP into the magne-
tosheath. The magnetic ﬁeld is again more variable since
this is solar wind plasma that has passed through the bow
shock. Energetic ions show a tailward ﬂow due to convec-
tion with the solar wind ﬂow, together with, in this case,
a modest intensity enhancement in the vicinity of the MP.
We should emphasize that the observations in Figure 1 are
very typical of the diﬀerent deep tail regions sampled by
ISEE-3 predomantly due to transverse motions of the tail
relative to the spacecraft, and the fact that the time axis
has been reversed here does not impact their interpreta-
tion.

3. Comparing V1 and ISEE-3 Observations

Comparing the V1 and ISEE-3 observations in Fig-
ure 1, and notwithstanding the factor of 1440 diﬀerence
in the time intervals shown (2 hours vs. 120 days), we
point out several close resemblances: (1) The drop in the
energetic ion intensity associated with the transition from
the plasma sheet into the lobe, and that at the heliocliﬀ;
(2) The onset of stronger, low variance magnetic ﬁelds
on moving from the plasma-dominated plasma sheet into
the lobe, similar to the transition observed as V1 crossed
the heliocliﬀ from the ACR-dominated region; (3) The
presence of low intensities of ions with pancake ion dis-
tributions peaked perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld in
the lobe, and the similar pancake distributions found in
the declining ACR intensity at V1 following the heliocliﬀ.
These distributions persisted for some time, in particular
at higher energies (Krimigis et al., 2013) – the V1 sectored
ion intensity plot shown in the bottom part of Figure 1
is from 20 days following the heliocliﬀ; no measurements
were made in the light-shaded sector, and the arrow indi-
cates the magnetic ﬁeld direction (which is ∼orthogonal to
the tail lobe ﬁeld in the ﬁgure); (4) The lobe ﬁeld direction
is determined by the solar wind ﬂow past the Earth, while
the transverse Parker spiral ﬁeld at V1 is caused by the
rotation of the heliosphere, and (5) Solar energetic parti-
cles can freely enter the open lobes of the geomagnetic tail,
as modeled by Owen et al. (1991b), and analogously, after
the heliocliﬀ, V1 moved into a region into which GCRs can
freely enter.

The similarity in these observations suggests that on
crossing the heliocliﬀ, V1 moved into a region analogous
to the tail lobes, consisting of ﬁeld lines that have recon-
nected with the interstellar ﬁeld downstream of the space-
craft but are still connected to the heliosphere at the sun-
ward end. The presence of ﬁeld lines beyond the heliocliﬀ
that are open to the ISM has been suggested in several
of the papers cited above, and will be discussed further
below, so this is certainly not an original suggestion. Nev-
ertheless, Figure 1 illustrates how phenomena observed in

Figure 2: Schematic of the magnetosphere for southward IMF
(adapted from Hughes, 1995) showing ﬁeld lines (numbered 1’ to
4 and 4’ in sequence) dragged into the tail following dayside recon-
nection; 5, and 5’ are lobe ﬁeld lines, connected to the Earth and
open to the solar wind. Hatched shading indicates the plasma sheet
in the tail center plane resulting from particle acceleration due to
reconnection at the tail neutral line. As indicated, ISEE-3 was typi-
cally tailward of this neutral line when in the distant tail.

dicular to the ecliptic. As discussed by Richardson et al.
(1987), ion anisotropies observed by ISEE-3 in the distant
tail plasma sheet were generally consistent with Compton-
Getting anisotropies arising from convection with the ther-
mal plasma. In the case shown here, the ﬂow is tailward
as can be seen in the pie plots, where the dominant sec-
tor facing the top of the ﬁgure corresponds to ions ﬂowing
tailward, and also in the third panel, where the tailward–
ﬂowing ion intensity is dominant.

In the centeral period of the ISEE-3 observations in
Figure 1 (between the vertical dashed lines), ISEE-3 was
in the south lobe, characterized by strong, low variance,
tail-aligned ﬁelds (φ ∼ 180o, θ ∼ 0o) and energetic ion in-
tensities around two orders of magnitude lower than in the
plasma sheet. The pie plots in this region show that these
ions have “pancake” angular distributions peaked at ∼ 90o
to the magnetic ﬁeld direction. Such angular distributions
are a pervasive feature of tail lobe ions as discussed and
modeled by Owen et al. (1991a) and Owen et al. (1991b).
This is also illustrated in the second panel of the ISEE-
3 observations in Figure 1 which shows the ratio of the
sum of the 35-56 keV ion counts in the two sectors of tele-
scope 2 viewing perpendicular to the lobe ﬁeld to twice the
spin-averaged sector count. This ratio is enhanced above
1 throughout most of the lobe interval, indicating that
above–average count rates occurred in the perpendicular
sectors. Also, in the third panel, intensities perpendicular
to the ﬁeld are generally dominant in the lobe. Pancake
distributions are present in the lobes because ions with ve-
locity components along the tail are lost along the open
lobe ﬁeld lines (after reﬂection near the Earth if initially

one situation may help in the interpretation of somewhat
similar phenomena found in very diﬀerent circumstances.
Comparison of the observations suggests furthermore that
the heliopause (analogous to the magnetopause) may lie
beyond the heliocliﬀ.

There are also several diﬀerences in the Voyager and
ISEE-3 observations beyond the time and distance scales.
The strongly tailward streaming ions observed by ISEE-3
in the plasma sheet in the top part of Figure 1 are due to
convection with high-speed plasma, often reaching several
hundred km/s (Richardson et al., 1987) compared with
near-zero solar wind speeds in the heliosheath that are in-
ferred from the nearly isotropic ion distributions at V1
(Decker et al., 2012). ISEE-3 also typically observed an
energetic ion “plasma sheet boundary layer” (PSBL), ev-
ident in Figure 1 extending a short distance beyond the
edge of the plasma sheet onto lobe-like ﬁeld lines (i.e., ex-
tending to the right of the left-hand vertical dashed line)
. An associated small diamagnetic depression in the mag-
netic ﬁeld, and waves driven by the right-hand resonant ion
beam instability (Tsurutani et al., 1985), are also typically
present and may just be discerned in the ﬁgure. Tailward
ion anisotropies in the PSBL are typically larger than ex-
pected from convection with the local plasma, indicating
that these ions are streaming freely through the thermal
plasma (Richardson et al., 1987). As discussed by Richard-
son & Cowley (1985), the PSBL in the deep tail is formed
by energetic particles accelerated at the neutral line that
stream away from the neutral line faster than the ther-
mal plasma sheet plasma and populate a wedge of ﬁeld
lines overlying the plasma sheet that maps back to the
NL. The thickness of this wedge is determined by particle
speed, with faster particles producing a thicker boundary
layer; the last ﬁeld line that has reconnected at the neutral
line (i.e., the “separatrix”; ﬁeld lines 6, 6’, and the corre-
sponding ﬁeld lines downtail of the NL in Figure 2) marks
the topological boundary of the PSBL for inﬁnite speed
particles. It should be emphasized that the PSBL is not
simply a gyroradius scale eﬀect due to plasma sheet par-
ticles gyrating into the lobe but is a consequence of ﬁeld
line connection to, and particle acceleration at, a neutral
line upstream of the spacecraft. The intensity decrease at
the edge of the PSBL is then on a gyroradius scale, and
B × ▽N anisotropies may be observed, transitioning to
the pervasive, low intensity, lobe ions with pancake distri-
butions (Richardson & Cowley, 1985). Another obvious
diﬀerence is that the tail is symmetric about the plasma
sheet, whereas the Voyager analogy corresponds to “half”
of the tail, with the plasma sheet playing the role of the
heliosheath.

ISEE-3 observations also suggest a possible interpreta-
tion of the anti-correlated variations in ion intensity and
magnetic ﬁeld strength preceding the heliocliﬀ. Figure 3,
adapted from Richardson & Cowley (1985), shows an in-
terval in which ISEE-3 (at 109 Re downtail) moved from
the north lobe through the plasma sheet (which in this case
included passage of a plasmoid; see Richardson & Cowley

Figure 3: Observations (adapted from Richardson and Cowley, 1985)
for an interval on March 25, 1983 when ISEE-3 was 109 Re downtail
and passed from the north lobe through the plasma sheet (during
passage of a plasmoid) to the south lobe and returned via the plasma
sheet to the north lobe. Enhancements of tailward streaming ions
were observed in the plasma sheet and in the adjacent plasma sheet
boundary layer on lobe-like ﬁeld lines. Brief oscillations in the ion
intensity are due to the edge of the region enhanced intensity moving
back and forth across the spacecraft, as discussed by Richardson and
Cowley (1985); letters refer to ion angular distributions in Figure 10
of that paper.

(1985) for details) into the south lobe and then returned
to the plasma sheet and north lobe. The top panel shows
EPAS ion intensities in 3 energy channels (35–56, 56–91,
91–147 keV), while the other panels show the intensities
of tailward- and earthward-streaming 35–56 keV ions in
Telescope 2 and the magnetic ﬁeld intensity, which again
illustrates the contrast between the weaker, variable ﬁelds
in the plasma sheet and the persistent, strong ﬁelds in
the lobes. The PSBL, with strongly tailward-ﬂowing ions,
can be seen prominently on lobe-like ﬁeld lines adjacent to
each boundary crossing of the plasma sheet (dashed ver-
tical lines). Of particular interest here are the brief, tem-
porary increases and decreases in the ion intensities that
occur before the ﬁnal crossing into or out of the PSBL,
e.g., at times J–N, O–T, X–c indicated in the ﬁgure (see
Figure 10 of Richardson & Cowley (1985) for sectored ion
distributions at each time). As discussed by Richardson
& Cowley (1985), these intensity ﬂuctuations were asso-
ciated with the spacecraft repeatedly brieﬂy sensing the
edge of the PSBL, probably due to tail motion, before the
ﬁnal crossing into or out of the PSBL. These motions of
the edge of the PSBL were conﬁrmed by comparing par-
ticle intensities in the six EPAS sectors (two from each of
the three EPAS telescopes) viewing perpendicular to the
lobe magnetic ﬁeld (see Figure 4 of Richardson & Cowley
(1985)). Such intensity ﬂuctuations/PSBL motions were
commonly observed by ISEE-3 at the transition between
plasma sheet and lobe.

Turning to the V1 observations, the anti-correlations
between the temporary decreases in ACR intensity and
simultaneous increases in ﬁeld intensity similarly may be
due (as also suggested by Quenby & Webber (2013)) to
the spacecraft at least twice temporarily approaching and
crossing the heliocliﬀ and sensing the related transitions in
ﬁeld and ion intensities (ﬁrst two solid vertical lines in the
bottom part of Figure 1) before retreating again (dashed
vertical lines), presumably due to motion of the heliocliﬀ,
before making the ﬁnal and complete crossing (last solid
vertical line). There may also be a brief approach to the
heliocliﬀ midway between the ﬁrst dashed and second solid
vertical lines suggested by a brief spike in the ﬁeld inten-
sity. The ACR and GCR observations of Krimigis et al.
(2013) and Stone et al. (2013) appear to support this pic-
ture since during at least the second possible approach
to/crossing of the heliocliﬀ, pancake ion distributions ap-
pear to be present (as discussed above, a feature of the
lower intensity ions following the heliocliﬀ), and there are
also temporary increases in the GCR intensity associated
with each approach that however do not reach the ﬁnal
and persistent GCR intensity observed following the he-
liocliﬀ. On the other hand, Florinski et al. (2015) note
that the intensities observed in two sectors of the V1 LET
detecting ions with gyro centers closer to and further from
the Sun relative to the spacecraft declined and increased
in sequence during the particle intensity/ﬁeld ﬂuctuations.
This suggests that sequence of structures passed over the
spacecraft rather than an advancing then retreating front.
However, the presence of, for example, corrugations on the
front (which may also, at least locally, have a normal that
is inclined to the radial direction) might be a way to rec-
oncile the anisotropy observations with a single boundary.

4. Summary and Discussion

We have noted similarities between V1 energetic par-
ticle and magnetic ﬁeld observations near the crossing of
the heliocliﬀ in August, 2012 and at the transition between
the plasma sheet and lobes in the distant geomagnetic tail
observed by ISEE-3, despite the vast diﬀerences in size
and time scales. We suggest that the heliocliﬀ is a bound-
ary between an ACR-dominated region of the heliosheath,
analogous to the thermal plasma-dominated tail plasma
sheet, and a region of ﬁeld lines that remain connected to
the heliospheric ﬁeld but have reconnected with the inter-
stellar ﬁeld beyond V1 that is analogous to the lobes of
the geomagnetic tail. The analogy then suggests that the
heliopause is located not at the heliocliﬀ but some distance
beyond, analogous to the magnetopause. The temporary
variations in ACR, magnetic ﬁeld and GCR intensities ob-
served by V1 ahead of the heliocliﬀ may be due to slight
in and out motions of the heliocliﬀ causing V1 to brieﬂy
sense the changes in these intensities as it approaches the
heliocliﬀ then retreats; similar motions were frequently ob-
served by ISEE-3 at the edge of the plasma sheet boundary
layer. However, recently-reported V1 ion anisotropies may

suggest a more complicated scenario. Even if this analogy
turns out to be invalid, it is nonetheless interesting to note
the remarkable similarities between these disparate sets of
observations.

Since V1 is headed towards the nose of the heliosphere,
the suggested lobe-like region following the heliocliﬀ is
clearly unrelated to the tail of the heliosphere. It is also
not clear from the single spacecraft observations whether
the heliocliﬀ is a large-scale boundary, or the crossing of a
relatively localized structure, possibly dynamic in nature
rather than static.

In the geomagnetic tail, we have discussed how an ener-
getic particle plasma sheet boundary layer layer is formed
that maps to a neutral line Earthward of the spacecraft
and that the boundary of this layer is a topological bound-
ary formed by the ﬁeld separatrix mapping to the neu-
tral line. An analogy on a large scale might be with the
blunt termination shock scenario of McComas & Schwar-
don (2012) in which the heliocliﬀ is associated with the
crossing of the last ﬁeld line (also a topological bound-
ary) that connects to the shock and is ﬁlled with ACRs.
Schwadron & McComas (2013) have suggested that recon-
nection between heliospheric and interstellar ﬁelds analo-
gous to a ﬂux transfer event (and consistent with a lobe-
like topology) might account for the V1 observations. Re-
cently, Gloeckler & Fisk (2015) have proposed that the he-
liocliﬀ is a division between what they term the “hot” he-
liosheath and the “cold” heliosheath, with the heliopause
lying at a greater distance. The cold heliosheath is “the re-
gion where escape [of higher energy particles (ACRs, pick
up ions and the tail of the solar wind distribution)] across
the heliopause occurs” (cf., energetic particle escape in
the tail lobes) while the hot heliosheath contains com-
pressed and heated solar wind, and may be the analog
of the plasma sheet in the tail. A feature of the Gloeckler
& Fisk (2015) model is the decoupling of the solar wind
plasma and ACRs, which is somewhat analogous to the
free energetic particle streaming, unrelated to the local
plasma ﬂow, in the PSBL.

Swisdak et al. (2013) have interpreted the V1 observa-
tions in terms of a highly-structured heliopause including
islands formed by the reconnection of heliospheric and in-
terstellar ﬁelds. Their Figure 4 is reminiscent of the struc-
ture of the plasma sheet in the geomagnetic tail, in par-
ticular at active times, showing the formation of neutral
lines and plasmoids. In their interpretation, the heliopause
passes through the center line of these structures, and lies
inside the region of ﬂuctuating ﬁeld and particle intensities
(believed to be associated with the passage of magnetic is-
lands) prior to the heliocliﬀ, i.e., in the tail analogy, the
heliopause lies in the plasma sheet rather than at the mag-
netopause.

As noted above, the unexpectedly high plasma densities
following the heliocliﬀ inferred from plasma wave observa-
tions (Gurnett et al., 2013) have provided the main evi-
dence that V1 may have entered the ISM. In the case of the
tail, lobe plasma (electron) densities measured by ISEE-

5

3 were typically comparable to those in the plasma sheet
(Zwickl et al., 1984) (∼ 0.1 cm−3) and lower than those in
the magnetosheath except near the magnetopause where
magnetosheath plasma may enter the lobes. The distri-
bution of enhanced densities in the lobe also depends on
the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld which
controls reconnection at the magnetopause (Gosling et al.,
1985). Thus, by analogy, the ISM-like densities suggested
by the V1 plasma wave observations might indicate that
the spacecraft is in a region where interstellar plasma can
enter the heliosphere along open ﬁeld lines, and possibly is
approaching the actual heliopause. On this point, we note
(as have, for example Schwadron & McComas (2013) and
Gloeckler & Fisk (2015)) that a change in the direction of
the ISM and/or the IMF at V1 (assuming it is still within
the heliosphere) from the current conﬁguration may have
profound eﬀects on the connection between the region be-
yond the heliocliﬀ and the ISM, much as a change in the
direction of the IMF impinging on the Earth, e.g., from
southward (as in Figure 2), favoring dayside reconnection
with magnetospheric ﬁelds, to northward, when reconnec-
tion of lobe ﬁeld lines with the IMF may occur at the cusps
(e.g., Cowley (1983)), strongly inﬂuences the conﬁguration
of the magnetotail and its connection with the IMF.
