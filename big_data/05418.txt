ANALYTICAL MODELS OF EXOPLANETARY ATMOSPHERES.

III. GASEOUS C-H-O-N CHEMISTRY WITH 9 MOLECULES

KEVIN HENG1 AND SHANG-MIN TSAI1

Draft version March 18, 2016

ABSTRACT

We present novel, analytical, equilibrium-chemistry formulae for the abundances of molecules in hot ex-
oplanetary atmospheres that include the carbon, oxygen and nitrogen networks. Our hydrogen-dominated
solutions involve acetylene (C2H2), ammonia (NH3), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ethylene
(C2H4), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), methane (CH4), molecular nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O). By considering
only the gaseous phase, we prove that the mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is governed by a decic equation
(polynomial equation of degree 10). We validate our solutions against numerical calculations of equilibrium
chemistry that perform Gibbs free energy minimization and demonstrate that they are accurate for temperatures
from 500–3000 K. In hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, the ratio of abundances of HCN to CH4 is nearly con-
stant across a wide range of carbon-to-oxygen ratios, which makes it a robust diagnostic of the metallicity in
the gas phase. Our validated formulae allow for the convenient benchmarking of chemical kinetics codes and
provide an efﬁcient way of enforcing chemical equilibrium in atmospheric retrieval calculations.

1. INTRODUCTION

To date,

then we expect

Atmospheric chemistry is an indispensible ingredient in
the study of exoplanetary atmospheres, as it teaches the
practitioner how and when to be surprised.
For ex-
if hydrogen-dominated atmospheres are in chem-
ample,
ical equilibrium,
the dominant carbon
low
carriers to be methane and carbon monoxide at
and high temperatures, respectively.
the con-
tributions to the atmospheric chemistry literature have
mostly taken the form of numerical calculations using
equilibrium chemistry and chemical kinetics codes (e.g.,
Burrows & Sharp 1999; Lodders & Fegley 2002; Line et al.
2011; Visscher & Moses 2011; Moses et al. 2011, 2013a,b;
Kopparapu, Kasting & Zahnle 2012; Madhusudhan 2012;
Ag´undez et al. 2014; Hu & Seager 2014; Hu, Seager & Yung
2015; Venot et al. 2015). A complementary approach, which
is standard in the astrophysical literature, is to develop an-
alytical models (Heng, Lyons & Tsai 2016; Heng & Lyons
2016). The current study is the third in a series of papers de-
voted to constructing analytical models for exoplanetary at-
mospheres to aid in the development of intuition, following
Heng & Workman (2014) (for shallow-water ﬂuid dynamics)
and Heng, Mendonc¸a & Lee (2014) (for two-stream radiative
transfer).

(2016)

Speciﬁcally,

Heng, Lyons & Tsai

and
Heng & Lyons (2016) have previously derived solutions
for the relative abundances of molecules for purely gaseous
chemistry and in C-H-O (carbon-hydrogen-oxygen) systems.
Here, we present novel, generalized analytical solutions
for purely gaseous C-H-O-N (carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-
nitrogen) systems with 6 and 9 molecules.
In §2, we
concisely describe the theoretical setup, which we use to
consider 6 and 9 molecules in §3 and 4, respectively. We
present our results are in §5 and conclude in §6.

2.1. Net Chemical Reactions

Our C-H-O-N network contains 6 net reactions,

CH4 + H2O ⇆ CO + 3H2,
CO2 + H2 ⇆ CO + H2O,

2CH4 ⇆ C2H2 + 3H2,
C2H4 ⇆ C2H2 + H2,
2NH3 ⇆ N2 + 3H2,

NH3 + CH4 ⇆ HCN + 3H2.

(1)

The last three reactions, involving nitrogen, were informed
by Burrows & Sharp (1999), Lodders & Fegley (2002) and
Moses et al. (2011). Excluding molecular hydrogen, there are
9 molecules in total.

2.2. Normalized Equilibrium Constants

For each net reaction, there is a corresponding equilibrium
constant. In a departure from Heng, Lyons & Tsai (2016) and
Heng & Lyons (2016), we write the normalized equilibrium
constants without primes as superscripts. Obeying the order

where P0 = 1 bar is the reference pressure and Runiv =
8.3144621 J K−1 mol−1 is the universal gas constant. For
a molecule X, we have deﬁned ˜nX ≡ nX/nH2, where nX
denotes the number density. We call ˜nX the “mixing ratios”.
Appendix A lists the Gibbs free energies of formation for
C2H4, N2, NH3 and HCN. Appendix A also lists the Gibbs
free energies associated with the last three net reactions (de-
noted by ∆ ˜G0,i for the i-th reaction). The Gibbs free energies
for the other molecules and the ﬁrst three net reactions have
previously been stated in Tables 1 and 2 of Heng & Lyons
(2016), respectively.

2.3. Particle Conservation Equations

By counting the number of atoms sequestered in each

molecule, we obtain

nCH4 + nCO + nCO2 + 2nC2H2 + 2nC2H4

+ nHCN = nC,

4nCH4 + 2nH2O + 2nH2 + 2nC2H2 + 4nC2H4

+ nHCN + 3nNH3 = nH,

nH2O + nCO + 2nCO2 = nO,
2nN2 + nNH3 + nHCN = nN.

(3)

The number densities of atomic carbon, hydrogen, oxygen
and nitrogen are given by nC, nH, nO and nN, respectively.

3. C-H-O-N NETWORK WITH 6 MOLECULES

To develop our current analytical method, we ﬁrst ignore
CO2, C2H2 and C2H4 in our analysis. Heng & Lyons (2016)
have shown that CO2 is subdominant compared to CO and
H2O, unless the metallicity is orders of magnitude higher than
solar abundance.

If we make the simpliﬁcation that 2nH2 = nH (hydrogen-
dominated atmospheres) and render the number densities di-
mensionless, then we end up with

˜nCH4 + ˜nCO + ˜nHCN = 2˜nC,
˜nH2O + ˜nCO = 2˜nO,
2˜nN2 + ˜nNH3 + ˜nHCN = 2˜nN.

(4)

We deﬁne the elemental abundances as ˜nC ≡ nC/nH, ˜nO ≡
nO/nH and ˜nN ≡ nN/nH. The goal is to decouple this sys-

quires that we ﬁrst rewrite some of the mixing ratios in terms

By substituting these expressions into the equation involv-
ing molecular nitrogen, we obtain a quintic equation for the

This derivation demonstrates that it is possible to decouple
a C-H-O-N system and obtain an equation in terms of only
˜nCO.

4. C-H-O-N NETWORK WITH 9 MOLECULES

We now add CO2, C2H2 and C2H4 back into the analysis
and use the method developed in the previous section. The
particle conservation equations become

˜nCH4 + ˜nCO + ˜nCO2 + ˜nHCN

+ 2˜nC2H2 + 2˜nC2H4 = 2˜nC,

˜nH2O + ˜nCO + 2˜nCO2 = 2˜nO,
2˜nN2 + ˜nNH3 + ˜nHCN = 2˜nN.

The various mixing ratios are now described by

The expressions for ˜nCH4 and ˜nN2 are the same as those given
in equation (5). To make the algebra tractable, we have de-

5. RESULTS

We deﬁne the solar abundance of elements as being ˜nO =
5 × 10−4, ˜nC = 2.5 × 10−4 and ˜nN = 10−4. This implies
that the carbon-to-oxygen and nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios are,
respectively,

C/O ≡

˜nC
˜nO

= 0.5 and N/O ≡

˜nN
˜nO

= 0.2.

(17)

Unless otherwise stated, these are our default parameter val-
ues.

5.1. Benchmarking

We validate our analytical formulae by comparing them to
calculations done using the TEA code (Blecic et al. 2016),
which performs Gibbs free energy minimization. In attempt-
ing to solve the decic equation in (16), we ﬁnd that the proce-
dure is sometimes numerically unstable, because the values of
the various Ai coefﬁcients may vary by many orders of mag-
nitude. In practice, it is sufﬁcient to obtain the mixing ratio

of CO by solving the quintic equation in (8), which is numer-
ically stable. We use the polyroots routine in Python.
The other mixing ratios are then obtained using equations (2),
(5) and (11).

In Figures 1, 2 and 3, we represent calculations from the
TEA code as circles overplotted on our calculations, which are
shown as curves. On a logarithmic plot of the mixing ratios,
the agreement between them is excellent across a wide range
of temperatures (500–3000 K), C/O and N/O.

5.2. Basic Trends

Figure 1 shows the trends associated with the mixing ra-
tios versus temperature for solar-abundance, C/O = 1 and
nitrogen-rich atmospheres. The trend of CH4 and CO be-
ing the dominant carbon carriers at low and high tempera-
tures, respectively, persists even in the presence of nitrogen
(Madhusudhan 2012). Analogously, NH3 and N2 are the
dominant nitrogen carriers at low and high temperatures, re-
spectively (Burrows & Sharp 1999; Lodders & Fegley 2002;
Moses et al. 2011). HCN closely tracks the rise of CO with
temperature. In a C/O = 1 environment, HCN inhibits the
formation of CH4 and C2H2, as we can see from comparing
the solutions derived in the current study versus the nitrogen-
free solutions of Heng & Lyons (2016). Even when N/O is
increased tenfold from 0.2 to 2, the trends produced resemble
those of the solar-abundance case.

Figure 2 shows the mixing ratios versus C/O. The low-
and high-temperature trends have previously been eluci-
dated, namely that carbon-rich atmospheres are water-poor
and methane-rich (Madhusudhan 2012; Moses et al. 2013a;
Heng, Lyons & Tsai 2016). HCN closely tracks the abun-
dance of CH4 as C/O increases, suggesting that the ratio of
their abundances should be a constant. Figure 3 shows that
the mixing ratios are somewhat insensitive to N/O. Unsurpris-
ingly, only the nitrogen-bearing species (N2, NH3 and HCN)
show any dependence of their mixing ratios on N/O.

We note that our formulae do not consider graphite forma-
tion, which is expected to occur in carbon-rich atmospheres
(Moses et al. 2013b). For this reason, we urge caution when

5

applying these formulae to C/O > 1 situations.

5.3. Observational Diagnostics

Figure 4 shows the ratio of abundances of various pairs of
molecules. The C2H2/CO2 ratio is a sensitive diagnostic for
C/O (Venot et al. 2015; Heng & Lyons 2016), spanning more
than 10 orders of magnitude as C/O varies from 0.1 to 10,
suggesting that this ratio may be used as an observational di-
agnostic for inferring the value of C/O, provided a given spec-
trum of an exoplanetary atmosphere has the sufﬁcient resolu-
tion and signal-to-noise for such an inference to be made via
an inversion technique. The CH4/H2O ratio is somewhat less
sensitive to C/O, but provides an additional check on the in-
ferred value of C/O. The HCN/CH4 ratio is essentially con-
stant across a factor of 100 in C/O and its value depends only
on the metallicity, implying that it may be used as a robust
diagnostic for the metallicity of the atmosphere.

6. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS

We have developed a novel analytical method for comput-
ing the abundances of 6 and 9 molecules in a C-H-O-N sys-
tem in chemical equilibrium. Our work demonstrates a use-
ful trick, which is that trace molecules may formally be left
out of the system of non-linear equations and computed later
using the mixing ratios of other molecules. Since our formu-
lae have been successfully validated by a Gibbs free energy
minimization code, they may be used to benchmark chemical
kinetics codes. Reproducing chemical equilibrium is a key
test of a chemical kinetics code. Our formulae may also be
used in retrieval calculations to enforce chemical equilibrium
throughout the atmosphere. Such an approach may be used to
test the Bayesian evidence for chemical disequilibrium when
interpreting the spectrum of an exoplanetary atmosphere.
