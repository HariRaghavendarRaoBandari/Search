The relation between classically chaotic dynamics and quantum localization is studied in a system
that violates Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem, namely, kicked rotor in a discontinuous
potential barrier. We show that the discontinuous barrier induces chaos and more than two distinct
sub-diﬀusive energy growth regimes, the latter being an unusual feature for Hamiltonian chaos. We
show that the dynamical localization in the quantized version of this system carries the imprint
of non-KAM classical dynamics through the dependence of quantum break time on sub-diﬀusion
exponents. We brieﬂy comment on the experimental feasibility of this system.

The interplay between disorder, in the form of chaotic
classical dynamics, and quantum localization continues
to attract attention due to a rich variety of its manifes-
tations. Kicked rotor (KR), in which a particle is period-
ically kicked by an external ﬁeld, is a paradigmatic exam-
ple for both chaos and localization [1]. From dynamics
point of view, the classical KR, for large kick strengths,
displays chaos and energy diﬀusion [2]. The suppression
of diﬀusion in the quantum regime results from destruc-
tive quantum interference and is termed dynamical lo-
calization (DL) due to its analogy with Anderson local-
ization [2, 3]. Dynamical localization was experimentally
observed in an atom-optics based realization of KR [4].
The emergence of quantum localization in the variants of
KR has led to novel scenarios for quantum ratchets [5],
classical-quantum correspondence [6], coherent quantum
control [7], metal-insulator transition [8], nonlinearity ef-
fects [9] and decoherence [10]. Recently, an unusual clas-
sical ’dynamical localization’ was reported as well [11].

Kicked rotor is a system that obeys Kolmogorov-
Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem [2] implying that the tran-
sition from regular to predominantly chaotic dynamics
happens gradually by breakup of invariant tori upon vari-
ation of a control parameter. We have obtained a good
understanding of diﬀusion and localization eﬀects in KR
as a representative KAM system [2]. Comparatively,
much less is known about chaotic systems that violate
KAM theorem, the so-called non-KAM systems. Theo-
retical studies of non-KAM systems such as the kicked
oscillator [14], kicked particle in potential well conﬁgu-
rations [15, 16] have revealed an abrupt transition from
integrability to chaos leading to global transport due to
the absence of invariant tori that fragments phase space.
In fact, experiments on non-KAM systems have exploited
this property to enhance or in general control electronic
transport in semiconductor superlattices [12] and in cou-
pled billiards in the form of two-dimensional electron gas
in an external magnetic ﬁeld [13].

Inspite of global classical transport, quantum local-
In chaotic systems, lo-
ization can suppress transport.
calization takes various forms.
In time-dependent sys-
tems such as KR, DL is a purely quantum eﬀect that

disregards classical dynamics beyond certain time-scale
called break-time.
In autonomous chaotic systems like
the atoms in strong magnetic ﬁelds and coupled oscil-
lators [17] semiclassical scarring localization arises due
to the inﬂuence of isolated unstable periodic orbits [18].
Partial barriers in classical phase space, cantori [19], can
also lead to localization as in the case of ionic motion
in a Paul trap [21] and in a special case of Bunimovich
billiards modelled as a discontinuous quantum map [22].
The classical analogue of the latter system violates KAM
theorem.

Generally, quantum-classical correspondence in non-
KAM systems has not been studied in detail and promises
new insights in view of the rich classical dynamical fea-
tures. Motivated by this, we report on a new non-KAM
classical feature, sub-diﬀusive transport induced by dis-
continuous potential barriers rather than by cantori, and
its relation to quantum localization. We note that in
Hamiltonian systems anomalous transport arising due to
the presence of sticky islands in chaotic sea is generally
super-diﬀusive in nature and sub-diﬀusive behavior is not
seen [23]. Currently, quantum localization in disordered
media with correlated disorder is vigorously investigated,
both in theory and experiments [24]. Thus, our results
are also relevant in the broader context of the continu-
ing interest in anomalous diﬀusion [25] and localization
properties of wave phenomena in diﬀerent areas [26].

tential barriers is

recall that for identical value of kick strength, and indeed
for any value of ǫ << 1, the phase space of kicked rotor
is covered with invariant tori IKR(ω) characterized by
winding number ω. In the presence of barriers, a parti-
cle initially on a kicked rotor tori IKR(ω) would continue
to evolve on it until interrupted by the barrier disconti-
nuities at x = −w/2 or w/2. This results in reﬂection
(q → q, p → −p) or refraction (q → q, p → ±pp2 − 2V0)
KR(ω′),
of the particle and it hops onto another tori I
with ω 6= ω′. Every barrier encounter leads to tori hop-
ping. As n >> 1, multiple barrier encounters and the
resulting tori hopping ensure that the autocorrelations
decay quickly, resulting in chaotic dynamics (Fig. 1(c-
e)) and diﬀusion of the energy absorbed from periodic
kicks. This is one manifestation of non-KAM type dy-
namics in which barriers play a crucial role in genesis of
chaos and energy diﬀusion.

′

However, if the condition ±Rπ + φ = πl, l ∈ Z is satis-
ﬁed in region I, then IKR(ω) are preserved even with the
barrier encounters [16]. This leads to KAM-like tori in re-
gion I as shown for b = 0.0 in Fig. 1(b). It can be shown
that the dynamics is completely hyperbolic if R < 0.5
and φ = 0 [15]. Physically interesting scenario for energy
transport arises if l /∈ Z leading to non-KAM chaos in re-
gion I, and region II displays invariant tori but punctured
by the discontinuities in the potential. In the rest of the
paper, we choose parameters (listed in Fig. 2) satisfying
these conditions. This choice ensures absence of complete
dynamical barriers and cantori are not eﬀective as barri-
ers to transport. Under these conditions, as kicks impart
energy, global sub-diﬀusive transport becomes possible
since the chaotic particles in region I penetrate through
the punctured tori into region II.

The classical mean energy growth is sub-diﬀusive and
displays two distinct power-law regimes within experi-
mentally accessible timescales. Fig. 2(a) illustrates clas-
sical mean energy hEi as a function of time (in units of
kick period) for the same set of parameters as in Fig.
1(d). The initial condition is an ensemble of points with
−w/2 < q < w/2 and p = 0. The ﬁrst sub-diﬀusive
regime in Fig. 2(a) and the accompanying stroboscopic
section (inset A) show that most of the particles are phys-
ically conﬁned to the well in region I. Note that the mean
energy growth can be described by hEin ∼ D1 nµ1 , where
D1 is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient and 0 < µ1 ≤ 1 is the ex-
ponent. This sub-diﬀusive behavior can be attributed to
correlations. In general, the phase space in region I can
be mixed (intricate chain of islands in a chaotic sea as in
Fig. 1(c)) for R > 0.5 or completely chaotic for R < 0.5 if
V0 >> 1. When R > 0.5, the energy growth is suppressed
signiﬁcantly due to the correlations induced by the dy-
namics on IKR (ω) between successive tori hops, sticki-
ness in the vicinity of chain of islands and slow diﬀusion
through the punctured tori in region II. When R < 0.5,
even though the phase space appears chaotic due to tori

kicking ﬁeld. Physically, Eq. 1 represents a kicked parti-
cle in a potential V (q) with periodic boundary conditions
applied at positions x = ±(w + b)/2. Throughout this
paper, we choose φ = 0, w + b = 2π, λ = 2π and con-
sequently 0 < R < 1. For convenience, we denote the
regions below and above the barrier height V0 by I and
II. In general, the dynamics of the system is determined
by V0, ǫ, and either R or b. The classical dynamics can
be explicitly reduced to a map on a suitably chosen stro-
boscopic section.

If V0 = 0, then Eq. 1 reduces to a kicked rotor on an
inﬁnite cylinder. For ǫ = 0, it is classically an integrable
system.
If V0 > 0, the potential V (q) is non-analytic
and violates the assumptions of KAM theorem. Thus,
when external kicks are introduced with ǫ > 0, KAM
tori that partition the phase space are destroyed, even if
ǫ is arbitrarily small, leading to chaotic dynamics. Figure
1(b-e) shows stroboscopic sections obtained by evolving
the classical map for kick strength ǫ = 0.25 with several
values of w. The nature of dynamics can be understood
in terms of that of kicked rotor (V0 = 0 in Eq. 1). We

hops, correlations of type hqnqn+Ni ∝ N −γ exist because
the evolution between two successive barrier encounters
is conﬁned to a kicked rotor tori IKR(ω). By tuning the
number of barrier encounters in one kick period we can
enhance or suppress correlations. As w → 0, the bar-
rier encounters and tori hops in one kick period increase
and hence µ1 → 1 (see Figs 2(b) and 3(a)), the quasi-
linear diﬀusion limit [1, 2] expected under conditions of
predominant chaos.

We deﬁne τ1 = (D1/D2)1/(µ2−µ1) as the time at
which ﬁrst sub-diﬀusive regime characterized by {D1, µ1}
crosses over to the second characterized by {D2, µ2}.
The second regime begins after the particles enter re-
gion II for n > τ1, as seen in the inset B in Fig. 2.
The energy growth is sub-diﬀusive with hEin ∼ D2 nµ2,
0 < µ2 < 1.
In region II, we expect the phase space
to display kicked rotor tori IKR (ω) punctured by the dis-
continuities in V (x). Note that one complete crossing
of a barrier of width b > 0 involves two refractions, at
say, x = w/2 and x = (w/2) + b. When a particle with
energy E0 enters the above-barrier region and assuming
that it does not suﬀer any kick while transiting this re-
gion, the net change in position between the last and the
next kick is denoted by ∆q. If ∆qKR represents a similar
quantity for the kicked rotor (V0 = 0), we can show that
δq = |∆q− ∆qKR| = b(β− 1), where β = (1− V0/E0)−1/2.
Clearly, if E0 & V0, then δq >> 0 and if E0 >> V0 we
have δq → 0. This diﬀerence leads to torus hopping. Fur-
ther, as δq 6= 0, it translates into momentum diﬀerence

δp = |∆p− ∆pKR| = ǫ| sin(xk − (p/|p|)δq)− sin xk| at the
position of next kick xk. Thus, if E0 & V0, the invariant
tori do not survive due to large tori hopping induced by
the discontinuities. This appears as chaotic dynamics in
region II in inset B of Fig. 1. On the other hand, if
E0 >> V0, then invariant tori are largely preserved with
minor dispersion and hence the tori hopping are a neg-
ligible eﬀect. Similar result can be obtained even if the
particle suﬀers kicks while transiting the barrier region.
For n > τ1, ignoring a short transient, multiple barrier in-
duced refractions interspersed with dynamics on IKR(ω)
leads to classical energy growth that is slower than nor-
mal diﬀusive growth. This regime lasts until a time scale
of τ2 ≈ 104τ1 (in units of kick period) by which time
the particles evolve to the vicinity of resonance struc-
ture at |p| = 2π. This can be thought of as long-lasting
since τ2 is much longer than experimentally relevant time
scale with atom optics as the test bed. This sub-diﬀusion
mechanism has a weak though systematic dependence on
barrier width b. As Figs. 2(b) and 3(b) reveal, µ2 ≈ 0.2
to a ﬁrst approximation.
To the best of our knowledge, long-lasting sub-diﬀusion
in chaotic Hamiltonian systems has not been reported be-
fore, though it was observed in the quantum dynamics of
nonlinear disordered systems [27]. Generally, anomalous
diﬀusion in chaotic Hamiltonians are of super-diﬀusive
type due to stickiness or the presence of accelerator
modes in phase space [19, 23, 28]. Further, for bounded
and ergodic systems, super-diﬀusion follows as a conse-
quence of Kac’s theorem [19, 20] which guarantees that
the mean recurrence time exists. However, the phase
space of the system in Eq. 1 being an inﬁnite cylinder,
is not bounded and Kac’s theorem does not strictly ap-
ply. The sub-diﬀusion induced by the potential barriers
combined with unbounded phase space is associated with
diverging mean recurrence times (not shown here).

Next, we focus on the quantum regime of the Hamil-
tonian in Eq. 1. The period-1 Floquet operator for this
kicked system can be obtained as

ers. The time scale over which the quantum dynamics
follows classical is related to the inverse of mean spacing
of the Floquet spectrum. Assuming that the mean level
density ρ(E) of the unperturbed system near the ground
state is proportional to E−1/2, we obtain an estimate for

we obtain the Floquet phases φi and Floquet states ξi
for i = 1, 2, 3...N , where N is the number of basis states
(eigenstates of H0).

We evolve an initial wavepacket ψ(x, 0), chosen to

be the ground state of H0, under the action of bU
and its quantum mean energy hEi is displayed in Fig.
4(a). Clearly, the quantum hEi does not follow the sub-
diﬀusive behavior of the classical dynamics beyond cer-
tain time scale and instead saturates indicating a local-
ization eﬀect in energy basis. From the point of view of
random matrix theory, this system falls in the class of
circular orthogonal ensemble (COE). Though we expect
Wigner distribution for the spacings of Floquet phases,
quantum localization of the Floquet states leads to un-
correlated spacings and Poisson distribution. This is
shown in Fig. 4(b) and is similar to that of kicked rotor
with connections to Anderson localization [3]. The ﬂo-
quet states in the unperturbed basis, shown in Fig. 4(c),
display exponential localization. As s → 0, all the ﬂo-
quet states are localized though the localization lengths
diverge as −2/(2−µ)
, µ being one of the sub-diﬀusion ex-
ponents, and the spectral statistics transits from Poisson
to COE distribution.

We discuss how non-KAM nature of Hamiltonian in
Eq. 1 manifests in the quantum domain. As shown be-
fore, the classical sub-diﬀusion of energy arises due to
hopping between KR tori IKR(ω) or punctured tori, a

where i = 1 or 2 corresponding to any one of the two
classical sub-diﬀusive regimes and α is a constant. Sig-
niﬁcantly, the non-KAM nature of the system leaves its
imprint in the quantum domain through the dependence
of n∗ on diﬀusion exponents µ1 or µ2. For relatively
large values of s, n∗ < τ1 and the scaling exponent is
2/(2 − µ1) depending on the ﬁrst classical sub-diﬀusive
regime with exponent µ1. As s → 0, we have n∗ > τ1
and the scaling exponent is 2/(2 − µ2), corresponding to
the second classical sub-diﬀusive regime with exponent
µ2. As shown in Fig. 5, a log-log plot of n∗ against s
shows linear behavior and agrees well with the theoreti-
cally expected slope −2/(2 − µ), µ = µ1 or µ2. This is
shown for two sets of parameters. Thus, by varying ei-
ther w or λ, the classical diﬀusion rate can be controlled
leading to a tunable quantum break-time n∗. As s → 0,
the quantum energy diﬀusion rate and the length of diﬀu-
sive time scale n∗ can both be controlled by manipulating
system parameters.

In the limit of ǫ >> 1, the system displays predom-
inantly chaotic dynamics. The potential barriers play
only a marginal role in the genesis of chaos and we ob-
tain a single normal diﬀusion regime similar to the case
of the kicked rotor. As would be expected, the quan-
tum dynamics displays dynamical localization. The cen-
tral results discussed here, barrier induced chaos and
sub-diﬀusive dynamics and its quantum manifestations,
would be valid for a larger class of kicked particles placed
in barrier-type potentials of various conﬁgurations. We

comment on the experimental feasibility of this system.
The kicked rotor was realized using cold atoms in optical
lattices created by two counter-propagating pulsed laser
beams [4]. To experimentally realize kicked particle in
potential barriers, an additional set of laser beams, that
are always on, can be used to create conﬁning potential
with large barrier height. Periodically kicked particle in a
single conﬁning potential barrier was experimentally re-
alized nearly a decade back [29]. While this set-up could
be extended, it is also possible to achieve this using semi-
conductor heterostructures.

In summary, we study the classical and quantum dy-
namics of a kicked particle interacting with a discon-
tinuous potential. In this non-KAM system, chaos and
sub-diﬀusion are induced by the encounters of the parti-
cle with the discontinuous barriers. The classical mean
energy displays more than two distinct regimes of sub-
diﬀusive growth, a unique feature not seen in Hamilto-
nian systems before. In the quantum domain, the ﬂoquet
states are localized in the energy basis. Signiﬁcantly, the
non-KAM nature of the system manifests in the quantum
regime through the dependence of quantum break-time
on sub-diﬀusion exponents, leading to a tunable break-
time. These results can be generalized for various dis-
continuous potential conﬁgurations.
