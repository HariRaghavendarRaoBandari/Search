Abstract. This is the ﬁrst of two papers establishing structural properties of
R2, the structure giving rise to pure patterns of resemblance of order two, which
partially underly the results in [3] and [4] as well as other work in the area.

Letting ≤ denote the usual ordering of the class of ordinal numbers ORD
and using B (cid:22)Σn C to indicate that B is a Σn-elementary substructure of
C, deﬁne the structure R2 = (ORD, ≤, ≤1, ≤2) by inductively deﬁning the
binary relations ≤1 and ≤2 on ORD so that

α ≤n β iﬀ (α, ≤, ≤1, ≤2) (cid:22)Σn (β, ≤, ≤1, ≤2)

for n = 1, 2 and all ordinals α and β (in other words, the restriction of R2
to β is deﬁned by induction on β).

We will ﬁnd it convenient to use an alternate deﬁnition for R2 which
was introduced in [3]. The equivalence of the two deﬁnitions will be estab-
lished elsewhere. Moreover, our investigation of pure patterns of resemblance
naturally lead to studying other variants of R2 described below.

Some key properties of R2 which are easily established are

• ≤ is a linear ordering of the ordinals.

• ≤1 and ≤2 are partial orderings of the ordinals.

• ≤2 respects ≤1 and ≤1 respects ≤.

where for two partial orderings ≤′ and ≤′′ on a set X we say that ≤′′ respects
≤′ if

x ≤′′ y =⇒ x ≤′ y

1

for all x, y ∈ X and

x ≤′ y ≤′ z and x ≤′′ z =⇒ x ≤′′ y

for all x, y, z ∈ X.

The main results of this paper, the various recurrence theorems, establish
the recurrence of certain conﬁgurations as one proceeds through the ordinals.
Understanding this process for R2 leads in a natural way to study slight
variants of R2. These results hinge on the cornerstone of the paper: the
Main Structural Lemma. While not diﬃcult to prove, the Main Structural
Lemma has far reaching consequences.

We deﬁne the components of ORD with respect to ≤1 to be the usual
connectivity components of ≤1. The fact that ≤1 respects ≤ implies that
the components are intervals of the form [κ, λ) where κ and λ are successive
elements among the set of ordinals which are minimal in ≤1. In fact, the
components of ≤1 are easily seen to be closed intervals. These intervals are
enumerated by Iα (α ∈ θ1).

The First Recurrence Theorem for ≤1 says that the isomorphism type of
Iα depends only on the last component of the additive normal form of α i.e.
Iβ+ωα ∼= Iωα.

The Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤1 says

(min(Iωα), max(Iωα)] ∼= (0, max(Iα)]

This reduces the structure of Iωα to that of earlier components in the case
ωα is not an epsilon number.

For the remainder of the introduction, assume ωα is an epsilon number

i.e. ωα = α.

Partition Iα into intervals as follows. Let X be the collection of ν ∈ Iα
such that ν is minimal with respect to ≤2 and ν≤1τ whenever ν ≤ τ ∈ Iα.
The components of Iα with respect to ≤2 are intervals of the form [ν, µ) where
ν and µ are two successive elements of X along with {τ | ν ≤ τ ∈ Iα} when ν
is the maximal element of X. Since ≤2 respects ≤1, elements from diﬀerent
components are never related by ≤2. The components of Iα with respect to
≤2 are enumerated by Jη (η ∈ θ2).

Let κ be the least element of Iα. The Recurrence Theorem for Small
Intervals says that (µ, µ + κ) ∼= (0, κ) whenever µ is divisible by κ. Moreover,
ν 6≤2 δ whenever ν ≤ µ < δ < µ + κ.

2

The First Recurrence Theorem for ≤2 says that the isomorphism type of
Jη depends only on the last component of the additive normal form of η i.e
Jξ+ωη ∼= Jωη .

Section 1 contains background.
Section 2 contains the main deﬁnitions for the alternate versions of R2.
Section 3 establishes general facts about the notions from Section 2.
The Main Structural Lemma is presented in Section 4.
Section 5 establishes the First Recurrence Theorem for ≤1.
Section 6 develops the notion of incompressible sets, a weakened version

of isominimal sets from [3] suﬃcient for the purposes of this paper.

Section 7 establishes the Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤1.
Section 8 establishes the Recurrence Theorem for Small Intervals and the

First Recurrence Theorem for ≤2.

The sequel to this paper will contain the Second Recurrence Theorem for
≤2, an analogue of the Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤1 which provides
a characterization of the growth of the intervals Jωη as η increases. This
characterization hinges on the Order Reduction Theorem which describes
Jωη in terms of an initial segment of a variant of R2 denoted by Rα
2 .

We deﬁne Rα

2 whenever α is an additively indecomposable ordinal. The
results of this paper for arbitrary α will only be necessary in the sequel to
this paper. The present paper is self-contained if one ignores the variants
and assume α = 1 throughout. As will be clear, the case α = 1 is essentially
R2.

1 Preliminaries

As a general principle, we will omit parameters in deﬁned notions when they
are understood by the context.

KP will be used to denote Kripke-Platek set theory (see [1] for back-
ground) and KPω is Kripke-Platek set theory with the axiom of inﬁnity.
KPω is the base theory for the results in this paper. The theory KPℓ0 has
an axiomatization consisting of the usual axiomatization for KPω with ∆0-
comprehension removed and an additional axiom saying that every set is an
element of an admissible set. ZF denotes Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.

We will write card(X) for the cardinality of a set X. ORD will denote
the class of ordinals with the usual ordering ≤ and arithmetic operations. ω
is the least inﬁnite ordinal and the elements of ω are natural numbers. An
ordinal is additively indecomposable if it is not 0 and is closed under addition.

3

The additively indecomposably ordinals can be characterized as the ordinals
of the form ωβ for some β. For ordinals α and β, α divides β if there exists
and ordinal δ such that β = α · δ. We will also say either β is divisible by
α or β is a multiple of α to mean α divides β. β is a limit multiple of α if
β = α · δ for some limit ordinal δ. Similarly, β is a successor multiple of α if
β = α · δ for some successor ordinal δ.

For A a ﬁnite set of ordinals and i less than the cardinality of A, (A)i is
the ith element of A. We extend < to ﬁnite sets of ordinals in the usual way
e.g. X < Y means that ξ < η for all ξ ∈ X and η ∈ Y . We will also write
X 6≤k Y to mean ξ 6≤k η whenever ξ ∈ X and Y ∈ η.

Contrary to standard practice, we will allow structures for a ﬁrst-order
language L to interpret the function symbols as partial operations on the
universe which fail to give an interpretation to some constant symbols. In
other words, we use the word “structure” to refer to what are called partial
structures elsewhere (see [2]). We will write |A| for the universe of a structure
A. The deﬁnition of when a term is deﬁned in a structure is the natural one,
proceeding from “bottom up”, as is the deﬁnition of the value of the term in
the structure. When t is a term all of whose variables are among v1, . . . , vn
and a1, . . . , an ∈ |A| we write t(a1, . . . , an)A for the value of t in A, if it exists,
whenv1, . . . , vn are interpreted as a1, . . . , an respectively. See the theory of
partial terms in [2] for details.

When A is a structure for L and X ⊆ |A|, the set generated in A from X
is the smallest subset of |A| containing X and closed under the interpretation
of the function and constant symbols of L in A.

We ﬁx a special symbol (cid:22) which will be assumed to be a 2-place relation
symbol in every language in which it occurs. Suppose A is a structure for
the ﬁrst-order language L which includes (cid:22). If the interpetation of (cid:22) in A
is a linear ordering of |A| we will say that A is a linearly ordered structure.
If the interpretation of (cid:22) in A is a well ordering of |A| we will say that A is
a well ordered structure.

Fix a linearly ordered structure A.
If X is a nonempty subset of |A|, max(X) will be the largest element of

X and min(X) will be the smallest element of X if such elements exist.

We will use standard interval notation e.g. for a, b ∈ |A| let [a, b)A denote
the set of all x ∈ |A| such that a(cid:22)Ax≺Ab (we write ≺A for the strict part of
the linear ordering (cid:22)A). We will also use ∞ and −∞ as interval endpoints
in the usual ways e.g. write (−∞, a)A for the set of all x ∈ |A| such that
x≺Aa and [a, ∞)A for the set of all x ∈ |A| such that a(cid:22)Ax.

4

Assume X is a subset of |A|. For x an element of |A| which is not the
least element of A, x is a limit point of X if X intersects (y, x)A whenever
y≺Ax and x is not minimal in A. We say x is a limit element of A if it is a
limit point of |A|. X is topologically closed in A if every limit point of X is
an element of X.

If y≺Ax and y is the largest element of (−∞, x) then x is the successor

of y.

Suppose x is a limit element of A. A subset X of (−∞, x) is coﬁnal in x if
x is a limit point of X. Similarly, a collection X of ﬁnite subsets of (−∞, x)
is coﬁnal in x if X contains a subset of (y, x)A whenever y≺Ax.

A subset I of |A| is an initial segment of A if x ∈ I whenever x(cid:22)Ay for
some y ∈ I. An initial segment I of A is a proper initial segment of A if
I 6= |A|. A substructure B of A is an initial substructure of A if |B| is an
initial segment of A. B is a proper initial substructure of A if the universe
of B is a proper initial substructure of A.

An element a of |A| is decomposable in A if there is a function symbol
f and a1, . . . , an≺Aa such that a = f(a1, . . . , an) (we view constant symbols
as 0-ary function symbols).
If a is not decomposable in A then a is in-
decomposable in A. A substructure B of A is a closed substructure of A
if every element of B which is indecomposable in B is indecomposable in
A, or, equivalently, whenever b ∈ |B| is decomposable in A then there is a
function symbol f and there are b1, . . . , bn ∈ |B| such that b1, . . . , bn≺Bb and
b = f(b1, . . . , bn). A subset of |A| is a closed subset of A if it is the universe of
a closed substructure of A (note that we do not require a substructure of A
to be closed under the interpretations of the function symbols in A so that
any subset of |A| is the universe of a substructure of A). Clearly, any set
of indecomposable elements is closed and the closed subsets are closed under
initial segments and arbitrary unions. Also, if A is a well ordered structure
for L then every ﬁnite subset of |A| is contained in a ﬁnite closed subset of
|A|.

The closed sets in variants of R2 will be particularly simple. In particular,
there are no functions in R2 itself implying every ordinal is indecomposable
and every set is closed.

2 Variants of R2

We will assume ρ is an arbitrary additively indecomposable ordinal for the
rest of the paper.

We will introduce structures similar to R2 which are useful in our analysis.

Deﬁnition 2.1 For 0 ≤ ξ < ρ deﬁne f ρ

ξ : ORD → ORD so that

f ρ

ξ (ρ · ζ + ǫ) =(ρ · ζ + ξ

ρ · ζ

if ǫ = 0
if ǫ 6= 0

(1)

for all ordinals ζ and ǫ with ǫ < ρ. Rρ is the structure

(ORD, f ρ

ξ (0 ≤ ξ < ρ), ≤)

Rρ is an EM structure as deﬁned in [3].
Notice that f ρ
α is divisible by ρ.

0 (ρ · ζ + ξ) = ρ · ζ whenever ξ < ρ. Therefore, f ρ

0 (α) = α iﬀ

Lemma 2.2

1. The indecomposable ordinals of Rρ are the ordinals which are divisible

by ρ i.e. ordinals of the form ρ · ζ.

2. An ordinal α is indecomposable in Rρ iﬀ f ρ

0 (α) = α.

3. A set of ordinals X is closed in Rρ iﬀ σ ∈ X whenever σ is divisible

by ρ and σ + ξ ∈ X for some ξ < ρ i.e. X is closed under f ρ
0 .

4. Any union or intersection of closed sets is closed.

5. An initial segment of a closed set is closed.

6. For all ordinals α, α is closed.

7. For all ordinals α, [α, ∞) is closed iﬀ α is divisible by ρ.

8. If X is closed and α is divisible by ρ then X ∩ [α, ∞) is closed.

6

Proof. Straigtforward.

For example, to prove part 3, suppose X is a set of ordinals.
First, assume X is closed in Rρ. Also, suppose σ + ξ ∈ X where σ is
divisible by ρ and ξ < ρ. We must show σ ∈ X. This is trivial if ξ = 0, so we
may assume 0 < ξ. Since σ + ξ = fξ(σ), σ + ξ is decomposable. Therefore,
there exists η < ρ and τ ∈ X such that τ < σ + ξ such that fη(τ ) = σ + ξ.
Clearly, τ = σ and η = ξ.

Now, assume σ ∈ X whenever σ is divisible by ρ and σ + ξ ∈ X for some
ξ < ρ. To show X is closed, assume α ∈ X is decomposable. There exists
ξ < ρ and σ < α such that fξ(σ) = α. Since fξ(σ) > σ, σ is divisible by ρ
and fξ(σ) = σ + ξ. By assumption, σ ∈ X.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 2.3 For α an ordinal, remρ(α), the remainder of α with respect
to ρ, is the unique ε < ρ such that α = ρ · δ + ε for some δ.

As usual, when ρ is clear from the context, we will simply write rem for

remρ.

Lemma 2.4 Assume X is a closed set of ordinals and h is an order preserv-
ing function which maps X into ORD. The following are equivalent.

1. h is an embedding of X, as a substructure of Rρ, into Rρ.

2. For all ordinals σ and ξ, if σ is divisible by ρ, ξ < ρ and σ + ρ ∈ X

then h(σ + ξ) = h(σ) + ξ and h(σ) is divisible by ρ.

3. The range of h is closed and rem(α) = rem(h(α)) for all α ∈ X.

Proof. (1 ⇒ 2) Follows from the deﬁnition of fξ and parts 1 and 2 of the
previous lemma.

(2 ⇒ 3) Assume part 2.
We will use part 3 of the previous lemma to show h[X] is closed. Suppose
σ + ξ ∈ h[X] where σ is divisible by ρ and ξ < ρ. There exist α ∈ X such
that σ + ξ = h(α). There exist τ and η such that τ is divisible by ρ, η < ρ
and α = τ + η. Since X is closed, τ ∈ X. By part 2, σ + ξ = h(τ ) + η and
h(τ ) is divisible by ρ. Clearly, σ = h(τ ).

Now suppose α ∈ X. We will show rem(h(α)) = rem(α). Let ξ =
rem(α). There exists σ such that σ is divisible by ρ and α = σ + ξ. By part
2, h(α) = h(σ) + ξ and h(σ) is divisible by ρ. This implies rem(h(α)) = ξ.

(3 ⇒ 1) Notice that for any ordinals α, β and ξ with ξ < ρ, fξ(α) = β iﬀ

either

7

rem(β) = ξ and α is the largest γ such that γ ≤ β and rem(γ) = 0

or

rem(α) 6= 0 and β is the largest γ such that γ ≤ α and rem(γ) = 0.

The implication (3 ⇒ 1) follows from the observation that if Z is a closed
set of ordinals and δ, ε ∈ Z then δ is the largest γ such that γ ≤ ε and
rem(γ) = 0 iﬀ δ is the largest γ ∈ Z such that γ ≤ ε and rem(γ) = 0.
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.5 Assume X is a closed set of ordinals. If h is an order preserving
map of the indecomposable ordinals in X into the class of indecomposable
ordinals there is a unique extension h+ to X which is an embedding of X, as
a substructure of Rρ, into Rρ.

Proof. By the previous lemma.

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.6

1. For all α ∈ ORD, [ρ · α, ∞) ∼= ORD.

2. For all α, ξ ∈ ORD, if 0 < ξ < ρ then [α + ξ, ∞) ∼= [1, ∞).

Proof. Part 1 follows from the Lemma 2.4.

For part 2, notice part 1 implies that [α + ρ, ∞) ∼= [ρ, ∞) since ρ is
additively indecomposable. Now notice [α + ξ, α + ρ) and [1, ρ) both have
length ρ and nothing in either set is either in the range or domain of the
restriction any fξ.
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.7 Assume X is a closed set of ordinals and h is an embedding of
X, as a substructure of Rρ, into Rρ. If α is the least ordinal moved by h
then α is divisible by ρ.

Proof. Assume α is the least element moved by h. There are ζ and ξ < ρ
such that α = ρ · ζ + ξ. Argue by contradiction and assume ξ 6= 0. Since X
is closed, ρ · ζ ∈ X. Since ρ · ζ < α, h(ρ · α) = ρ · α. Since f ρ

ξ (ρ · ζ) = α,

h(α) = h(f ρ

ξ (ρ · ζ) = α

ξ (ρ · ζ)) = f ρ

ξ (h(ρ · ζ)) = f ρ

– contradiction.

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 2.8 Assume R is a structure of the form

(ORD, f ρ

ξ (ξ < ρ), ≤, (cid:22)1, (cid:22)2)

or the restriction of such a structure to some ordinal. Also assume X is a
closed set of ordinals (with respect to Rρ) which is a subset of |R|. A function
h : X → |R| is a covering of X in R if

1. h is an embedding of X as a substructure of Rρ into Rρ.

2. For α, β ∈ X and k = 1, 2.

α(cid:22)ρ

kβ =⇒ h(α)(cid:22)ρ

kh(β)

A set Y of ordinals is a covering of X in R if there is a function h which
is a covering of X in R with range Y .

We will say that a set of ordinals Y is a covering of X if there is a covering

of X in R with range Y and R is clear from the context.

Lemma 2.9 Assume R is as above.

1. The composition of coverings is a covering.

2. If X is a covering of Y and Y is a covering of Z then X is a covering

of Z.

3. The range of a covering is closed.

Proof. Clear.

α is not a limit multiple of ρ i.e. not of the form ρ· λ for some limit λ. On the
other hand, we will only be interested in the case when α is a limit multiple
of ρ.

2 is a special case of the deﬁnition of R2 in Deﬁnition

5.4 of [3].

Notice that f 1

0 is the identity function. The structure obtained by re-
moving f 1

relations of partial elementarity (this will be established elsewhere). Hence,

of R2 from the introduction as a special case.

2↓, ≤ρ
Following the usual convention, we will write α <ρ

2↑ and ≤ρ
k β when α ≤ρ

α 6= β.

Lemma 3.1 If α<1β then α is a limit multiple of ρ.

Proof. There are λ and η with η < ρ such that α = ρ · λ + η.

We claim α = ρ · λ. Argue by contradiction and assume 0 < η. This
implies ρ · λ < α. Let X = {ρ · λ} and Y = {α}. Notice that X ∪ Y is closed.
Since α <1 β, there is ˜α < α with ρ · λ < ˜α such that {ρ · λ, ˜α} is a covering
of {ρ · λ, α}. Since fη(ρ · λ) = α, this implies fη(ρ · λ) = ˜α – contradiction.

By letting X = ∅ and Y = {α} in the deﬁnition of ≤1 we see there exists

˜α < α. Therefore, α 6= 0.

To see that λ is a limit ordinal, it suﬃces to show there are coﬁnally many

ordinals below α which are divisible by ρ.

Suppose α′ < α. There are λ′ and η′ with η′ < ρ such that α′ = ρ · λ′ + η′.
Let X = {ρ · λ′, α′} and Y = {α}. By part 2 of Lemma 2.2, X and Y are
closed. Since α <1 β, there is ˜α < α with α′ < ˜α such that {ρ · λ′, α′, ˜α}
is a covering of {ρ · λ′, α′, α}. Since f0(α) = α, f0( ˜α) = ˜α. Therefore, ˜α is
divisible by ρ.
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.2 Assume α < β.

1. α≤1β iﬀ α is divisible by ρ and the deﬁnition of α≤ρ

1β holds with“X ∪Y

closed” replaced by “X and Y closed”.

2. α≤2↓β iﬀ α is divisible by ρ and the deﬁnition of α≤ρ

2↓β holds with

“X ∪ Y closed” replaced by “X and Y closed”.

Proof. By the previous lemma and parts 4, 5 and 8 of Lemma 2.2.

(cid:3)

We will use the previous lemma implicitly when checking whether α≤1β

or α≤2↓β for the rest of the paper.

The next two lemmas provide a useful alternative characterization of ≤ρ

2↑.

Lemma 3.3 Assume n ∈ ω and R is a ﬁnite subset of ρ. If Y is the collec-
tion of closed sets of ordinals Y such that

• the cardinality of Y is at most n and

12

• rem[Y ] ⊆ R

then there are only ﬁnitely many elements of Y up to isomorphism as sub-
structures of Rρ
2.

Proof. By Lemma 2.4, two ﬁnite closed sets are isomorphic as subsets of Rρ
iﬀ they have the same cardinality and the order preserving map between them
preserves remainders with respect to ρ. Hence, there are only ﬁnitely many
elements of Y up to isomorphism as substructures of Rρ. Clearly, among any
subcollection of Y whose elements are pairwise isomorphic as substructures
of Rρ, there are only ﬁnitely many isomorphism types as substructures of
Rρ
2.

sets which are coﬁnal in α with X < Y for all Y ∈ Y and X ∪ Y1
X ∪ Y2 whenever Y1, Y2 ∈ Y, and for any β ′ < β, there exists Y ∈ Y
and ˜Y with β ′ < ˜Y < β such that X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ∪ Y .

Proof. Straightforward using an easier version of the previous lemma in
which one assumes the elements of Y are pairwise isomorphic as substructures
of Rρ.
(cid:3)

We could have just as well replaced “there exists Y ∈ Y and ˜Y ” by “for
all Y ∈ Y there exists ˜Y ” in the right hand side of the equivalence. The form
above is slightly more convenient to apply.

Lemma 3.5

1. If α≤1β and X ⊆ α and Y ⊆ [α, β) are ﬁnite with X and Y closed
then there are coﬁnally many ˜Y below α such that X ∪ ˜Y is a covering
of X ∪ Y .

2. If α≤2↓β and X ⊆ α and Y ⊆ [α, β) are ﬁnite with X and Y closed
then there are coﬁnally many ˜Y below α such that X ∪ ˜Y is a covering
of X ∪ Y and ( ˜Y )i≤1α whenever i < card(Y ) and (Y )i≤1β.

13

3. Assume α, β1, β2 ∈ ORD with α ≤ β1, β2. If there are γi ∈ [α, βi) for
i = 1, 2 such that α ∪ (γ1, β1) ∼= α ∪ (γ2, β2) then α≤2↑β1 iﬀ α≤2↑β2.

Proof. For part 1, assume α′ < α. We need to show there exists ˜Y such
that α′ < ˜Y < α and X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ∪ Y . By Lemma 3.1, we may
assume α′ is divisible by ρ and X < α′.

Since α≤1β, there exists ˜Y ⊆ α such that X ∪ {α′} < ˜Y and X ∪ {α′} ∪ ˜Y

is a covering of X ∪ {α′} ∪ Y . X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ∪ Y .

The proof of part 2 is similar to the proof of part 1.
Part 3 is immediate.

Lemma 3.6

1. If α<2β then β is a limit multiple of ρ and there are

coﬁnally many γ below α such that γ<1α.

2. If α<2β<2γ then the collection of δ such that α<2δ is coﬁnal in γ.

Proof. For part 1, notice that if γ is divisible by ρ (equivalently, f0(γ) = γ)
then {γ} ∼= {δ} iﬀ δ is divisible by ρ. Since α≤2↑β, Lemma 3.1 implies the
collection of ordinals divisible by ρ is coﬁnal in β. Therefore, β is a limit
multiple of ρ.

By letting X = ∅ and Y = {α} in the deﬁnition of ≤2↓, we see there are

coﬁnally many γ below α with γ <1 α by part 2 of Lemma 3.5.

For part 2, assume α<2β<2γ. By Lemma 3.1, α and β are divisible by
ρ. Hence, {α} and {β} are closed. Since β≤1γ, there are coﬁnally many β ′
below β such that {α, β ′} is a covering of {α, β}. By Lemma 3.3, there is
a coﬁnal set of these β ′ for which the isomorphism type of {α, β ′} is ﬁxed.
Choose β0 to be one element of this set. Since β <2 γ, there are coﬁnally
many β ′ below γ such that {α, β ′} is a covering of {α, β0} and, hence, a
covering of {α, β}. Any such β ′ has the property that α≤2β ′.

Lemma 3.7

1. ≤1 respects ≤.

2. ≤2 respects ≤1.

3. ≤1 is a partial ordering of ORD.

4. ≤2↓, ≤2↑ and ≤2 are partial orderings of ORD.

14

Proof. Part 1 is clear.

For part 2, assume α≤1β≤1γ and α≤2γ. We will show α≤2β. We may

assume α < β < γ since the proof is trivial otherwise.

To show α≤2↓β, assume X ⊆ α and Y ⊆ [α, β) are ﬁnite with X and
Y closed. Since α≤2↓γ, there exists ˜Y ⊆ α such that X < ˜Y , X ∪ ˜Y is a
covering of X ∪ Y and ( ˜Y )i≤1α whenever (Y )i≤1γ. Since β≤1γ, ( ˜Y )i≤1α
whenever ( ˜Y )i≤1β.

To show α≤2↑β, assume X and Y are ﬁnite subsets of α with X and Y
closed and X < Y such that there are coﬁnally many ˜Y below α such that
X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ∪ Y . Since α≤2↑γ, there exists Y ∗ ⊆ [β, γ) such
that X ∪ Y ∗ is a covering of X ∪ Y . Since β≤1γ, part 1 of Lemma 3.5 implies
that there are coﬁnally many ˜Y below β such that X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of
X ∪ Y ∗.

The proof of part 3 is similar and easier than that of part 4, so we will

omit it.

The relations ≤2↓, ≤2↑ and ≤2 are clearly reﬂexive. Since ≤2↓, ≤2↑ and
≤2 are contained in ≤, they are antisymmetric. The transitivity of ≤2 follows
from that of ≤2↓ and ≤2↑.

To see that ≤2↓ is transitive, assume α≤2↓β≤2↓γ. To show α≤2↓γ, as-
sume X ⊆ α and Y ⊆ [α, γ) are ﬁnite with X and Y closed. Without loss
of generality, assume α ∈ Y . Since β≤2↓γ, a simple argument shows there
exists Y ∗ ⊆ [α, β) such that X ∪ Y ∗ is a covering of X ∪ Y and (Y ∗)i≤1β
whenever (Y )i≤1γ. The desired ˜Y can be obtained using the assumption
that α≤2↓β.

The transitivity of ≤2↑ is straightforward.

(cid:3)

The lemma implies that ≤k is a forest on ORD for k = 1, 2 i.e. a partial

ordering in which the precedessors of any element are linearly ordered.

Lemma 3.8

1. Assume 0 < α < β and k ∈ {1, 2}. If for all α′ < α and β ′ < β there

exist α′′ ∈ (α′, α] and β ′′ ∈ (β ′, β] such that α′′ ≤k β ′′ then α ≤k β.

2. For α ∈ ORD, the collection of β in ORD with α≤1β is a topologically

closed interval.

3. For α ∈ ORD, the collection of β ∈ ORD with α≤2β is topologically

closed.

15

4. For β ∈ ORD and k = 1, 2, the collection of α ∈ ORD with α ≤k β is

topologically closed.

Proof. For part 1, assume for all α′ < α and β ′ < β there exist α′′ ∈ (α′, α]
and β ′′ ∈ (β ′, β] such that α′′ ≤k β ′′.

First assume k = 1. To show α≤1β, suppose X ⊆ α and Y ⊆ [α, β) are
ﬁnite with X ∪ Y closed. There are α′′ ≤ α and β ′′ ≤ β such that X < α′′,
Y < β ′′ and α′′≤1β ′′. Since α′′≤1β ′′, there exists ˜Y ⊆ α′′ such that X < ˜Y
and X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ∪ Y .

Now assume k = 2 in part 1. The proof that α≤2↓β is similar to the
proof for k = 1. To show that α≤2↑β, assume X and Y are ﬁnite subsets of
α with X ∪ Y closed such that there are coﬁnally many ˜Y below α such that
X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ∪ Y . To show there coﬁnally many such ˜Y below
β, assume β ′ < β. There are α′′ ≤ α and β ′′ ≤ β such that X < α′′, β ′ < β ′′
and α′′≤2β ′′. Since α′′≤1β ′′, α′′≤1α. Notice that there are coﬁnally many ˜Y
below α′′ such that X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ∪ Y . This is an assumption if
α′′ = α and follows from part 1 of Lemma 3.5 otherwise since α′′≤1α. Since
α′′≤2↑β ′′, there are coﬁnally many ˜Y below β ′′ such that X ∪ ˜Y is a covering
of X ∪ Y . In particular, there exists ˜Y with β ′ < ˜Y < β ′′ such that X ∪ ˜Y
is a covering of X ∪ Y .

Parts 2-4 follow immediately from part 1.

(cid:3)

The following lemma will be useful in establishing relations of the form

α≤1β and α≤2↓β.

Lemma 3.9 Assume X < Y1 < Y2 are ﬁnite closed sets of ordinals and let
X ′ be the set of ξ ∈ X such that there is η ∈ Y2 with ξ≤2η. If X ′ ∪ Y1 is a
covering of X ′ ∪ Y2 then X ∪ Y1 is a covering of X ∪ Y2.

Proof. The lemma is trivial if the Yi are empty, so we may assume both Y1
and Y2 are nonempty.

Assume h is a covering of X ′ ∪ Y2 onto X ′ ∪ Y1. Since Y1 < Y2, the
least element of Y2 must be divisible by ρ by Lemma 2.7. Extend h to a
function h+ with domain X ∪ Y2 such that h+(α) = α for all α ∈ X. h+ is
an embedding by Lemma 2.4.

To see that h+ is a covering, assume α, β ∈ X and α≤kβ. If α, β ∈ X,
α, β ∈ X ′∪Y2 or α = β then hd+(α)≤kh+(β) is clear. Consider the remaining
case where α ∈ X − X ′ and β ∈ Y2. Since α 6∈ X ′, k = 1 and α≤1β. Since

16

h(α) = α and h+(β) = h(β), it suﬃces to show α≤1h(β). Since h(β) ∈ Y1,
α < h(β) < β. Since α≤1β, this implies α≤1h(β).
(cid:3)

The following lemma will be useful in establishing relations of the form

α≤2↑β.

Lemma 3.10 Assume X < Y < α ≤1 β where X and Y are ﬁnite closed
sets and let X ′ be the set of ξ ∈ X such that there is η ∈ Y such that ξ≤2η
. If there are coﬁnally many Y ′ below α such that X ∪ Y ′ is a covering of
X ∪ Y and ˜Y is a subset of β such that X < ˜Y and X ′ ∪ ˜Y is a covering of
X ′ ∪ Y then X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ∪ Y .

Proof. Assume ξ ∈ X, η ∈ Y and ξ≤1η. We claim ξ≤1β. The lemma is
easily veriﬁed using this fact.

Since there are coﬁnally many Y ′ below α such that X ∪ Y ′ is a covering
of X ∪ Y , there are coﬁnally many η′ below α with ξ≤1η′. By part 2 of
Lemma 3.8, ξ≤1α. Since α≤1β, ξ≤1β
(cid:3)

4 The Main Structural Lemma

Recall that ρ is an arbitrary additively indecomposable ordinal.

The following lemma is the key to the analysis in the remainder of the

paper.

Main Structural Lemma. Assume α ∈ ORD is not divisible by ρ. For all
γ ∈ ORD, if [0, α) 6≤2 [α, α + γ) then [1, 1 + γ] ∼= [α, α + γ].

Proof. Let h be the operation 1 + η 7→ α + η. By Lemma 2.6, h is an
isomorphism of [1, ∞) and [α, ∞) as substructures of Rρ.

We will argue by induction on γ. Assume γ ∈ ORD and the lemma is

true for γ ′ whenever γ ′ < γ.

Assume [0, α) 6≤2 [α, α + γ). By the induction hypothesis, the restriction
of h is an isomorphism of [1+δ, 1+γ) and [α, α+γ). Since [1, 1+γ] ∼= [α, α+γ]
as substructures of Rρ, it suﬃces to show that for k = 1, 2

(⋆)

1 + δ ≤k 1 + γ

iﬀ α + δ ≤k α + γ

whenever δ < γ.

17

Case 1: Assume k = 1.
Suppose δ < γ. We will show (⋆) holds.
(⇒) Assume 1 + δ≤11 + γ. To show α + δ≤1α + γ, assume X ⊆ α + δ
and Y ⊆ [α + δ, α + γ) are ﬁnite with X and Y closed. By Lemma 3.1, 1 + δ
is divisible by ρ implying α + δ is divisible by ρ (using the assumption that
ρ is additively indecomposable). By Lemma 2.2, both X and Y are closed.
We will show there exists ˜Y ⊆ α such that X < ˜Y and X ∪ ˜Y is a covering
of X ∪ Y . Let X ′ be the collection of ξ ∈ X such that ξ≤2η for some η ∈ Y .
By Lemma 3.9, it suﬃces to ﬁnd ˜Y ⊆ α such that X < ˜Y and X ′ ∪ ˜Y is
a covering of X ′ ∪ Y . Since [0, α) 6≤2 [α, α + γ), X ′ ⊆ [α, α + δ). Let µ
be the largest element of X ∪ {α}. Let X ′∗ = h−1[X ′], Y ∗ = h−1[Y ] and
µ∗ = h−1(µ). Since δ≤1γ, part 1 of Lemma 3.5 implies there exists ˜Y ∗ ⊆ δ
such that X ′∗ < ˜Y ∗, X ′∗ ∪ ˜Y ∗ is a covering of X ′∗ ∪ Y ∗ and µ∗ < ˜Y ∗. Let
˜Y = h[ ˜Y ∗]. Since µ∗ < ˜Y ∗, µ < ˜Y implying X < ˜Y . Since the restriction
of h is an isomorphism of [1, 1 + γ) and [α, α + γ), X ′ ∪ ˜Y is a covering of
X ′ ∪ Y .

(⇐) The proof is similar, but easier, than the (⇒) direction.

Case 2: Assume k = 2.
Suppose δ < γ.
(⇒) Assume 1 + δ≤21 + γ.
By Lemma 3.1, 1 + δ is of the form ρ · λ for a limit ordinal λ. This implies

δ = ρ · λ.

By the case k = 1, α + δ≤1α + γ.
We omit the proof that ρ · α + δ≤2↓ρ · α + γ since it is similar to the proof
of Case 1 (using the fact that we have established the case k = 1 to handle
the additonal condition in the deﬁnition of ≤2).

To show that α + δ≤2↑α + γ, assume that X and Y are ﬁnite subsets of
α + δ with X and Y closed and X < Y such that there are coﬁnally many ˜Y
below α + δ such that X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ∪ Y . We will show that there
are coﬁnally many ˜Y below α + γ such that X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ∪ Y .
Let X ′ be the collection of ξ ∈ X such that ξ≤2η for some η ∈ Y . Since
[0, α) 6≤2 [α, α + γ), X ′ ⊆ [α, α + δ). By Lemma 3.10, it suﬃces to show there
are coﬁnally many ˜Y below α + γ such that X ′ ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ′ ∪ Y .
This is straightforward using the induction hypothesis.

(⇐) The proof is similar to the (⇒) direction but easier.

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.1 Assume α1 and α2 are are ordinals and γ ∈ ORD satisfy [0, ρ ·
αi] 6≤2 [ρ · αi + 1, ρ · α + γ) for i = 1, 2. Moreover, let δi satisfy ρ · αi + δi =

18

max1(ρ · αi) for i = 1, 2 (δi may be ∞).

1. If either γ ≤ δ2 or δ1 ≤ δ2 then [ρ · α2, ρ · α2 + γ] is a covering of

[ρ · α1, ρ · α1 + γ].

2. If either γ ≤ δ1, δ2 or δ1 = δ2 then

[ρ · α1, ρ · α1 + γ] ∼= [ρ · α2, ρ · α2 + γ]

Proof. By Lemma 2.4

[ρ · α1, ρ · α1 + γ] ∼= [ρ · α2, ρ · α2 + γ]

as substructures of Rρ, and by the Main Structural Lemma

[ρ · α1 + 1, ρ · α1 + γ] ∼= [ρ · α2 + 1, ρ · α2 + γ]

as substructures of Rρ
2. To verify part 1, it remains to show that for k = 1, 2
and all ξ ≤ γ, if ρ· α1 ≤k ρ· α1 +ξ then ρ· α2 ≤k ρ· α2 +ξ. By assumption, the
case k = 2 is vacuous. The case k = 1 follows from the assumption γ ≤ δ2
or δ1 ≤ δ2.

Part 2 follows from part 1.

5 The First Recurrence Theorem for ≤1

Recall that ρ is an arbitrary additively indecomposable ordinal.

The decomposition of ORD into connectivity components with respect

to ≤1 provides insight into the structure of Rρ
2.

Deﬁnition 5.1 Assume α ∈ ORD and k ∈ {1, 2}. If there is a bound on
the ordinals β such that α≤kβ then maxρ
k(α) is the largest β ∈ ORD such
that α ≤k β. Otherwise, we write maxρ

k(α) = ∞.

Since ρ is ﬁxed we will often omit ρ as a parameter in notation as in the

previous section.

Lemma 5.2 The collection of κ ∈ ORD which are minimal with respect to
≤1 is topologically closed.

19

Proof. Assume κ ∈ ORD is a limit of minimal elements of ORD with respect
to ≤1. To see that κ is minimal with respect to ≤1, argue by contradiction
and assume ξ <1 κ. There is some η such that ξ < η < κ and η is minimal
with respect to ≤1. Since ≤1 respects ≤, ξ <1 η contradicting the fact that
η is minimal with respect to ≤1.
(cid:3)

The lemma implies that if the ordinals which are minimal with respect

to ≤1 are bounded then there is a largest such ordinal.

Deﬁnition 5.3 Let κρ
minimal with respect to ≤1 (we allow the possibility that θρ
to be the collection of β such that κα≤1β when α ∈ θρ
1.

1) enumerate the elements of ORD which are
1 = ∞). Deﬁne I ρ
α

α (α ∈ θρ

Notice that Iα = [κα, max1(κα)] when max1(κα) 6= ∞, and Iα = [κα, ∞)

otherwise.

In mildly strong theories, ZF is much stronger than required, there is
an ordinal κ with κ≤1∞. The least such κ is the largest ordinal which is
minimal with respect to ≤1.

Lemma 5.4

1. κ0 = 0 and max1(κ0) = κ0.

2. α 7→ κα is continuous.

3. If θ1 6= ∞ then there is an ordinal θ such that θ+1 = θ1 and max1(κθ) =

∞.

4. For all α < θ1, [0, κα) 6≤1 [κα, ∞).

5. If α < β < θ1 then Iα < Iβ and Iα 6≤1 Iβ.

Iξ.

6. ORD =Sξ∈θ1
7. If α ∈ θ1 then κα =Sξ<α Iξ.

8. If α + 1 < θ1 and 0 < ξ < ρ · ω then α + ξ < θ1, κα+ξ = max1(κα) + ξ

and max1(κα+ξ) = κα+ξ.

9. If α + 1 < θ1 then α + ρ · ω < θ1 and κα+ρ·ω = κα + ρ · ω.

10. If α < θ1 then κα is divisible by ρ iﬀ α is divisible by ρ.

20

11. For all α < θ1, there is no β such that κα <2 β.

Proof. Parts 1-7 follow directly from the deﬁnitions and Lemma 5.2.

For part 8, assume α + 1 < θ1. Lemma 3.1 implies that max1(κα + ξ) =
κα +ξ whenever 0 < ξ < ρ·ω. This implies κα+ξ = max1(κα)+ξ by induction
on ξ < ρ · ω.

Part 9 follows from parts 2 and 8.
Part 10 follows by induction on α using parts 1, 2 and 8 (notice that β + ρ

is always divisible by ρ since ρ is additively indecomposable).

Part 11 follows from part 1 of Lemma 3.6.

(cid:3)

We remark that max1(ρ · ω) = ρ · ω + 1. A more general result will be

proved later.

In the two recurrence theorems for ≤1, we will determine when Iα

We can make some simple observations here.

∼= Iβ.

By part 8 of the lemma, κα+ξ is not divisible by ρ when 0 < ξ < ρ and
Iα+ξ = {κα+ξ} which is not a closed set. This easily implies that the intervals
Iα+ξ with 0 < ξ < ρ are all isomorphic to each other.

On the other hand, κρ·β is always divisible by ρ by part 10 of the lemma.
This implies Iρ·β is closed. Therefore, Iρ·β is never isomorphic to Iα+ξ when
0 < ξ < ρ. We are left with determining when Iρ·β1

∼= Iρ·β2.

The following special case of Lemma 4.1 will be particularly useful.

Lemma 5.5 For all α with α + 1 < θ1, [κα+ρ, ∞) ∼= Rρ
2.

Proof. By parts 10 and 8 of the previous lemma, κα+ρ is divisible by ρ and
In particular, [0, κα+ρ] 6≤2 [κα+ρ + 1, ∞). Since 0 is
max1(κα+ρ) = κα+ρ.
divisible by ρ and max1(0) = 0, part 2 of Lemma 4.1 implies the desired
conclusion.
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.6 Assume α + 1 < θ1 and 0 < β < θ1.

1. α + β < θ1.

2. κα+β = max1(κα) + κβ

3. max1(κα+β) = max1(κα) + max1(κβ)

21

Proof. By part 8 of Lemma 5.4, κα+1 = max1(κα) + 1. By the Main Struc-
tural Lemma, the operation h given by γ 7→ max1(κα) + γ is an isomorphism
of [1, ∞) and [κα+1, ∞). An ordinal in [1, ∞) is a minimal element of [1, ∞)
with respect to ≤1 iﬀ it is a minimal element of ORD with respect to ≤1.
The collection of such ordinals is enumerated by κ1+ξ (1 + ξ ∈ θ1). Similarly,
an ordinal in [κα+1, ∞) is a minimal element of [κα+1, ∞) with respect to
≤1 iﬀ it is a minimal element of ORD with respect to ≤1. The collection
of such ordinals is enumerated by κα+1+ξ (α + 1 + ξ ∈ θ1). Since h is an
isomoprhism, h maps the ordinals which are minimal in [1, ∞) with respect
to ≤1 onto the ordinals which are minimal in [κα+1, ∞] with respect to ≤1.
Therefore, h(κ1+ξ) = κα+1+ξ whenever 1 + ξ ∈ θ1.

To establish parts 1 and 2, choose ξ so that β = 1 + ξ. By the previous
paragraph, h(κβ) = κα+β. Using the deﬁnition of h, max1(κα) + κβ = κα+β.
Using the fact h is an isomorphism again, h(max1(κβ)) = max1(h(κβ)).
Using the deﬁnition of h and part 2, max1(κα) + max1(κβ) = max1(κα+β).
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.7 Either θ1 = ∞ or θ1 = θ + 1 where θ is additively indecompos-
able and greater than ρ.

Proof. Assume θ1 6= ∞. By part 3 of Lemma 5.4, there exists θ such that
θ1 = θ + 1. By part 9 of Lemma 5.4, θ = ρ · λ for some limit ordinal λ.
By the previous lemma, if α < θ then α + θ = θ. Therefore, θ is additively
indecomposable.
(cid:3)

We will see later that θ1 is either ∞ or the successor of an epsilon number

greater than ρ.

Lemma 5.8 Assume α < θ1. κα is additively indecomposable iﬀ α is addi-
tively indecomposable.

Proof. Follows easily from part 2 of Lemma 5.6 and the continuity of α 7→ κα
(part 2 of Lemma 5.4).
(cid:3)

Theorem 5.9 (First Recurrence Theorem for ≤1) If α + 1 < θ1 and
0 < β < θ1 then Iα+β

∼= Iβ.

Proof. Assume α + 1 < θ1 and 0 < β < θ1.

22

By the Main Structural Lemma, the map h given by h(ξ) = max1(κα) + ξ

is an isomorphism of [1, ∞) and [max1(κα) + 1, ∞). Lemma 5.6 implies

h(κβ) = max1(κα) + κβ = κα+β

First, assume β + 1 < θ1. Iβ = [κβ, max1(κβ)] ∼= [h(κβ), h(max1(κβ))].

By Lemma 5.6 again,

h(max1(κβ)) = max1(κα) + max1(κβ) = max1(κα+β)

Therefore, Iβ

∼= Iα+β.

Now, assume β + 1 = θ1. By Lemma 5.7, β is additively indecomposable
and greater than ρ. Since α < β, α + β = β making the conclusion of the
theorem trivial.
(cid:3)

Incompressible Sets

Recall that ρ is an arbitrary additively indecomposable ordinal.

In this section, we introduce a weakening of the notion of isominimal set
from [3] suﬃcient for this paper. The existence of these incompressible sets
is easier to establish than that of isominimal sets and the inclusion of this
section makes the paper self-contained. On the other hand, for those familiar
with [3], this section can be skipped and the notion of an incompressible
covering of a set Y can be replaced by the notion of an isominimal copy of
Y and the notion of an incompressible set can be replaced by the notion of
an isominimal set.

Lemma 6.1 Assume ρ· δ < θ1 and δ is an inﬁnite additively indecomposable
ordinal. If Y is a ﬁnite closed subset of κρ·δ then there are coﬁnally many
subsets of κρ·δ which are isomorphic to Y .

Proof. Assume Y is a ﬁnite closed subset of κρ·δ. To show there are coﬁnally
many subsets of κρ·δ isomorphic to Y , suppose ξ < κρ·δ. There exists γ < δ
such that Y is a subset of κρ·γ and ξ < κρ·γ. By part 2 of Lemma 4.1 and part
2 of Lemma 5.6, [κρ·(γ+1), κρ·(γ+1)+ρ·γ) is isomorphic to [0, κρ·γ). Therefore,
there is a subset ˜Y of [κρ·(γ+1), κρ·(γ+1)+ρ·γ) which is isomorphic to Y . By
choice of γ, ξ < ˜Y . By assumption, δ is closed under addition. Therefore,
γ + 1 + γ < δ implying ˜Y ⊆ κρ·δ.
(cid:3)

23

Deﬁnition 6.2 For an ordinal β, deﬁne the index of β, indexρ(β) to be the
unique α < θ1 such that β ∈ Iα.

As usual, we will write index(β) for indexρ(β) when ρ is clear from the

context.

Deﬁnition 6.3 Assume Y is a ﬁnite closed set of ordinals. A covering
h of Y in Rρ
2 is a ρ-incompressible covering of Y if index(h(β)) ≤
index(h′(β)) for all β ∈ Y whenever h′ is a covering of Y in Rρ
2. The range
of a ρ-incompressible covering of Y will also be called a ρ-incompressible cov-
ering of Y . Y is ρ-incompressible if Y is a ρ-incompressible covering of
itself.

As usual, we will drop mention of ρ when it is understood from context

and write “incompressible covering” and “incompressible” for “ρ-incompressible
covering” and “ρ-incompressible” respectively.

Notice that being an incompressible covering of Y is not the same as

being a covering of Y which is incompressible.

Lemma 6.4

1. Any ﬁnite union of incompressible sets is incompressible.

2. If h and h′ are incompressible coverings of X then index(h(β)) =

index(h′(β)) for all β ∈ X.

3. If X is incompressible and X ∩ Iα 6= ∅ then X ∪ {κα} is incompressible.

4. Assume X is incompressible and κα ∈ X whenever X ∩Iα 6= ∅. If Y is a
ﬁnite closed set and index[Y ] ⊆ index[X] then X ∪Y is incompressible.

5. Assume X is a nonempty ﬁnite closed set such that min(X)≤1max(X).
A covering ˜X of X is an incompressible covering of X iﬀ ˜X ⊆ Iα where
α is minimal such that Iα contains a covering of X.

6. Assume X and Y are ﬁnite sets such that X ∪ Y is closed, no element
of Y is indecomposable, X < Y and X 6≤1 Y . If h is a covering of
X ∪ Y then h is an incompressible covering of X ∪ Y iﬀ h↾X is an
incompressible covering of X.

7. Assume X and Y are ﬁnite nonempty closed sets such that X < Y
and X 6≤1 Y . If ˜X is a covering of X and ˜Y is a covering of Y such
that ˜X < ˜Y then ˜X ∪ ˜Y is an incompressible covering of X ∪ Y iﬀ the
following conditions hold:

24

(a) ˜X is an incompressible covering of X.
(b) ˜Y = max( ˜X) + ρ + Y ∗ where Y ∗ is an incompressible covering of

Y .

8. Assume X and Y are ﬁnite sets such that X ∪ Y is closed, X < Y
and X 6≤1 Y . If h is an incompressible covering of X ∪ Y then the
restriction of h to X is an incompressible covering of X. In particular,
if X ∪ Y is incompressible then so is X.

9. If h is an incompressible covering of X and h[X] ∩ Iα 6= ∅ then α + 1 <
θ1, max(Iα) ∈ h[X] and if h(β) = max(Iα) then h(β) ≤ h′(β) for any
covering h′ of X. In particular, if X is incompressible and X ∩ Iα 6= ∅
then α + 1 < θ1, max(Iα) ∈ X and if β = max(Iα) then β ≤ h′(β) for
any covering h′ of X.

Proof. Parts 1 and 2 are immediate.

For part 3, assume h is a covering of X ∪ {κα}. Let β ∈ Iα. Since X is
incompressible, h(β) ∈ Iξ where α ≤ ξ. Since κα≤1β, h(κα)≤1h(β) implying
h(κα) ∈ Iξ.

Parts 4 is straightforward.
Part 5 is straightforward after noticing that any covering of X must be

contained in some Iξ.

For parts 6 and 7 we will use

Claim.
1. Assume h is a covering of X and β = max(X). If h(β) ∈ Iα and h(β)
is not the largest element of Iα then there is a covering h′ of X such
that h′ ≤ h and h′ : X → κα.

2. If h is an incompressible covering of X, β = max(X) and h(β) ∈ Iα

then h(β) = max(Iα) and h(β) ≤ h′(β) for any covering h′ of X.

3. If h is an incompressible covering of X, β is the largest indecomposable
in X and h(β) ∈ Iα then h(β) is the largest indecomposable in Iα and
h(β) ≤ h′(β) for every covering h′ of X.

Part 1 of the claim is immediate from the deﬁnition of ≤1. Parts 2 and 3

follow from part 1.

For part 6 of the lemma, suppose h is a covering of X ∪ Y and let h− be

the restriction of h to X.

25

First, assume h is an incompressible covering of X ∪ Y . To show h− is an
incompressible covering of X, assume f is a covering of X. By Lemma 2.5,
every embedding of X, as a substructure of Rρ, into Rρ extends uniquely to
an embedding of X ∪ Y . Let h′ be the embedding of X ∪ Y , as a substructure
of Rρ, into Rρ which extends f . Clearly, h′ is a covering of X ∪ Y . Since h is
incompressible, index(h(α)) ≤ index(h′(α)) for all α in X ∪ Y . In particular,
index(h−(α)) ≤ index(f (α)) for all α ∈ X.

Now assume that the restriction of h to X is an incompressible covering of
X. To show h is an incompressible covering of X ∪ Y , assume h′ is a covering
of X ∪ Y . By assumption, index(h(α)) ≤ index(h′(α)) for all α ∈ X. Let
β be the largest indecomposable ordinal in X. By part 3 of the of the claim
above, h(β) ≤ h′(β). Suppose α ∈ Y . Since X ∪ Y is closed, there exists
ξ < ρ such that α = β + ξ. Therefore, h(α) = h(β) + ξ ≤ h′(β) + ξ = h′(α)
implying index(h(α)) ≤ index(h′(α)).

For part 7, assume ˜X is a covering of X and ˜Y is a covering of Y such

that ˜X < ˜Y . Let σ = index(max( ˜X)).

Claim for part 7. Assume ˜X is an incompressible covering of X. For

all β, index(max( ˜X ) + ρ + β) = σ + ρ + index(β).

By part 2 of the claim above, max( ˜X) = max(Iσ) = max1(κσ). By part
8 of Lemma 5.4, max( ˜X) + ρ = κσ+ρ and max1(κσ+ρ) = κσ+ρ. By Lemma
5.6, κσ+ρ+ξ = κσ+ρ + κξ = max( ˜X) + ρ + κξ for all ξ with 0 < ξ < θ1. This
equation also holds for ξ = 0. Therefore, κσ+ρ+ξ ≤ max( ˜X) + ρ + β iﬀ κξ ≤ β
for all ξ < θ1. This implies the conclusion of the claim.

(⇒) Suppose ˜X ∪ ˜Y is an incompressible covering of X ∪ Y . Let h be the

covering of X ∪ Y with range ˜X ∪ ˜Y .

To verify (a), suppose f is a covering of X. We will show index(h(β)) ≤
index(f (β)) for all β ∈ X. By part 1 of the claim above, we may assume the
range of f is contained in κα for some α < θ1. By increasing α if necessary,
we may assume ˜X ∪ ˜Y < κα by part 2 of the claim above. Finally, we may
assume α has the form ρ · δ where δ is inﬁnite and additively indecomposable
by Lemma 5.7. Let X ′ be the range of f . By Lemma 6.1, there exists Y ′ ⊆ κα
which is isomorphic to ˜Y such that X ′ < Y ′. Clearly, X ′ ∪ Y ′ is a covering
of X ∪ Y and the covering h′ of X ∪ Y with range X ′ ∪ Y ′ extends f . Using
the fact h is incompressible, index(h(β)) ≤ index(h′(β)) = index(f (β)) for
β ∈ X.

To verify (b), notice that the least element of ˜Y must be indecomposable

26

and greater than the largest element of ˜X. Therefore, max( ˜X)+ρ ≤ min( ˜Y )
and there is a ﬁnite closed set Y ∗ such that ˜Y = max( ˜X) + ρ + Y ∗.

To show that Y ∗ is incompressible, assume Y ′ is a covering of Y . Suppose
i < card(Y ). We need to show index((Y ∗)i) ≤ index((Y ′)i). By Lemma
5.5, max( ˜X) + ρ + Y ′ is isomorphic to Y ′ implying it is a covering of Y .
This implies ˜X ∪ (max( ˜X) + ρ + Y ′) is a covering of X ∪ Y . Since ˜X ∪
˜Y is an incompressible covering of X ∪ Y , index((max( ˜X ) + ρ + Y ∗)i) ≤
index((max( ˜X)+rho+Y ′)i). By the claim for part 7, σ +ρ+index((Y ∗)i) ≤
σ + ρ + index((Y ′)i). Therefore, index((Y ∗)i) ≤ index((Y ′)i).

(⇐) Assume (a) and (b). To show ˜X ∪ ˜Y is an incompressible covering
of X ∪ Y , assume X ∪ Y is a covering of X ∪ Y where X is a covering of
X, Y is a covering of Y and X < Y . Since ˜X is an incompressible covering
of X, index(( ˜X)i) ≤ index((X)i) for all i < card(X). It remains to show
index(( ˜Y )i) ≤ index((Y )i) for all i < card(Y ).

Fix i < card(Y ) Since the least element of Y is indecomposable, max(X)+
ρ ≤ Y . By part 2 of the claim above, max( ˜X) ≤ max(X). Therefore,
max( ˜X) + ρ ≤ Y implying Y = max( ˜X) + ρ + Y ′ for some closed Y ′. By
Lemma 5.5, Y ′ is isomorphic to Y implying it is a covering of Y . Since Y ∗ is
an incompressible covering of Y , index((Y ∗)i) ≤ index((Y ′)i). By the claim
for part 7, index(( ˜Y )i) ≤ index((Y )i).
Part 8 follows from parts 6 and 7.
For part 9, let X0 be the collection of β ∈ X such that h(β) ≤ max(Iα).
Part 8 implies the restriction of h to X0 is an incompressible covering of X0.
The conclusion of part 9 follows from part 2 of the claim.
(cid:3)

Lemma 6.5 Assume X is a ﬁnite closed set of ordinals. There is an incom-
pressible covering of X.

Proof. By induction on the cardinality of X. When X is empty, the lemma
is trivial. So, we may assume X is nonempty. Let X1 be the collection of
β ∈ X such that min(X)≤1β. Let X2 be the collection of β ∈ X such
that max(X1) < β < max(X1) + ρ. Let X3 be the collection of β ∈ X
such that max(X1) + ρ ≤ β. Clearly, X1 < X2 < X3, X1 6≤1 X2 ∪ X3 and
X2 6≤1 X3. If X3 6= ∅, the existence of an incompressible covering follows
from the induction hypothesis and part 7 of the previous lemma. If X3 = ∅
and X2 6= ∅, the existence of an incompressible covering follows from part 6
of the previous lemma. If X2 = X3 = ∅, the existence of an incompressible
covering follows from part 5 of the previous lemma.

Lemma 6.6 If K is a ﬁnite set of ordinals such that

1. If α ∈ K then α + 1 < θ1.

2. If ρ · δ + ξ ∈ K and ξ < ρ then ρ · δ ∈ X.

3. If ρ · (n + 1) ∈ K where n ∈ ω then

{0, ρ · 1, ρ · 2, . . . , ρ · n} ⊆ K

4. If n ∈ ω and ρ · (δ0 + · · · + δn+1) ∈ K where δ0 ≥ · · · ≥ δn+1 are

additively indecomposable and 1 < δ0 then

{ρ · δ0, ρ · (δ0 + δ1), . . . , ρ · (δ0 + · · · + δn)} ⊆ K

then there exists an incompressible set X with index[X] = K.

Proof. We begin with a special case.

Claim 1. Assume ρ · δ + 1 < θ1 where δ is additively indecomposable

and 1 < δ. There is an incompressible Y with Y ⊆ Iρ·δ.

Choose ﬁnite closed X ⊆ κρ·δ and ﬁnite closed Y ⊆ [κρ·δ, max1(κρ·δ)]
with the property that there is no ˜Y ⊆ κρ·δ such that X < ˜Y and X ∪ ˜Y
is a covering of X ∪ Y . We may assume κρ·δ ∈ Y . Argue by contradiction
and assume Y is not incompressible. Let ˜Y be a covering of Y such that
β = index(( ˜Y )i) < index((Y )i) for some i. Since min(Y ) = κρ·δ≤1max(Y ),
min( ˜Y )≤1max( ˜Y ). Therefore, ˜Y ⊆ Iβ. By the previous lemma, we may
assume that X < ˜Y . Since ξ 6≤1 η for any ξ ∈ X and η ∈ Y , X ∪ ˜Y is a
covering of X ∪ Y – contradiction.

Since any ﬁnite union of incompressible sets is incompressible by part 1

of Lemma 6.4, the following claims imply the theorem.

Claim 2. For n ∈ ω and ξ < ρ, X = {0, ρ · 1, ρ · 2, . . . , ρ · n, ρ · n + ξ} is

incompressible and index[X] = X.

Straightforward since any covering maps indecomposable ordinals to in-
decomposable ordinals. Notice that index(ρ · i) = ρ · i for all i ∈ ω and
index(ρ · n + ξ) = ρ · n + ξ by parts 1 and 8 of Lemma 5.4.

Claim 3. Suppose δ0 ≥ δ1 ≥ · · · ≥ δn are additively indecomposable,

1 < δ0 and ξ < ρ. There is an incompressible set X with

index[X] = {ρ · δ0, ρ · (δ0 + δ1), . . . , ρ · (δ0 + · · · + δn), ρ · (δ0 + · · · + δn) + ξ}

28

For i ≤ n, let δ−

i satisfy δi = 1 + δ−

i = δi
otherwise. By Claim 1 and the fact that {0} is an incompressible subset of
. For i ≤ n, deﬁne Xi
I0, there exists an incompressible subset X ∗
by induction so that X0 = X ∗
i when i = j + 1.
Clearly, X0 < X1 < · · · < Xn.

0 and Xi = max(Xj) + ρ + X ∗

i . So, if δi = 1 then δ−

i = 0 and δ−

i of Iρ·δ−

i

We claim X0 ∪ · · · ∪ Xi is incompressible and Xi ⊆ Iρ·(δ0+···+δi) for i =

0, . . . , n.

Argue by induction.
The case i = 0 is clear by choice of X ∗
0 .
Assume i = j +1. By part 7 of Lemma 6.4, X0 ∪· · ·∪Xi is incompressible.

Since

we have

κδ−

i

≤ X ∗

i < κδ−

i +1

max(Xj) + ρ + κρ·δ−

i

≤ Xi < max(Xj) + ρ + κρ·δ−

i +1

By part 9 of Lemma 6.4, max(Xj) = max1(X0∪· · ·∪Xj) = max1(κρ·(δ0+···+δj )).
By parts 1 and 8 of Lemma 5.4, ρ = κρ and max1(ρ) = ρ. By part 2 of Lemma
i +1 =
5.6, this implies ρ + κρ·δ−
=
κρ·δi+1. By part 2 of Lemma 6.4 again, this implies that max(Xj)+ρ+κρ·δ−
κρ·(δ0+···+δi) and max(Xj) + ρ + κρ·δ−

i +1 = κρ·(δ0+···+δi)+1. Therefore,

= κρ·δi and ρ + κρ·δ−

i +1 = κρ+ρ·δ−

= κρ+ρ·δ−

i

i

κρ·(δ0+···δi) ≤ Xi < κρ·(δ0+·+δi)+1

i.e. Xi ⊆ Iρ·(δ0+···+δi).

If ξ = 0, X0 ∪ · · · ∪ Xn satisﬁes the conclusion of the claim. So, we may
assume 0 < ξ. Let δ = δ0 +· · ·+δn, X ′ = X0 ∪· · ·∪Xn and X = X ′∪{κρ·δ+ξ}.
It suﬃces to show X is incompressible. By part 8 of Lemma 5.4, κρ·δ+ξ =
max1(κρ·δ) + ξ. Since max(Iρ·δ) = max1(κρ·δ), part 9 of Lemma 6.4 implies
max1(κρ·δ) is in X ′. Let max1(κρ·δ) = ρ · τ + ǫ where ǫ < ρ. Since X ′ is
closed, ρ · τ ∈ X. Since κρ·δ+ξ = ρ · τ + (ǫ + ξ) and ǫ + ξ < ρ, X ′ ∪ {κρ·δ+ξ}
is closed. By part 6 of Lemma 6.4, X is incompressible.
(cid:3)

We remark that the converse of the previous lemma is true.

Lemma 6.7 If X is a ﬁnite nonempty set of ordinals such that X ⊆ κα for
some α < θ1 then there is an incompressible set X + such that X ⊆ X + and
max(index[X +]) = max(index[X]).

29

Proof. There is a ﬁnite set K satisfying the hypothesis of the previous
lemma such that index[X] ⊆ K and max(index[X]) = max(K). By the
previous lemma, there is an incompressible set X ′ such that index[X ′] = K.
By part 3 of Lemma 6.4, we may assume κα ∈ X ′ whenever α ∈ K. By part
4 of Lemma 6.4, X + = X ∪ X ′ is incompressible.
(cid:3)

7 The Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤1

Recall that ρ is an arbitrary additively indecomposable ordinal.

Lemma 7.1 Assume max1(α) 6= ∞ and [0, α] 6≤2 [α + 1, max1(α)]. There
exists λ < θ1 such that max1(α) = α + max1(κλ).

Proof. Let δ satisfy α + δ = max1(α). Let λ be maximal such that κλ ≤ δ.
We claim max1(κλ) = δ from which the conclusion of the lemma follows.
If max1(κλ) < δ then κλ+1 = max1(κλ) + 1 ≤ δ (by part 8 of Lemma 5.4)
which contradicts the choice of λ. Therefore, δ ≤ max1(κλ). Argue by
contradiction and assume δ < max1(κλ). This implies κλ≤1δ + 1 and 0 < κλ.
By the Main Structural Lemma, [1, δ + 1] ∼= [α + 1, α + δ + 1]. This implies
α + κλ≤1α + δ + 1. Since α + κλ ≤ α + δ = max1(α), this implies α≤1α + δ + 1
which contradicts the choice of δ.
(cid:3)

Theorem 7.2 (Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤1) For any ordinal
β, if ρ · ωβ < θ1 then

(∗)

max1(κρ·ωβ ) = κρ·ωβ + max1(κβ)

Proof. We will prove (∗) by induction on those β with ρ · ωβ < θ1.

Claim. Assume 0 < δ1 < δ2, δ2 is additively indecomposable and ρ · δ2 +

1 < θ1. If max1(κρ·δi) = κρ·δi + µi for i = 1, 2 then µ1 < µ2.

It suﬃces to show that κρ·δ2≤1κρ·δ2 + µ1 + 1. For this, suppose X ⊆ κρ·δ2
and Y ⊆ [κρ·δ2, κρ·δ2 + µ1] are ﬁnite with X and Y closed. We will show there
exists ˜Y ⊆ κρ·δ2 such that X < ˜Y and X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ∪ Y . Notice
that η 6≤k ζ for η ∈ X, ζ ∈ Y and k = 1, 2. By Lemma 3.9, it suﬃces to ﬁnd
˜Y ⊆ κρ·δ2 which is a covering of Y with X < ˜Y .

By part 1 of Lemma 4.1, Iρ·δ1 = [κρ·δ1, κρ·δ1+µ1] is a covering of [κρ·δ2, κρ·δ2+
µ1]. Therefore, Iρ·δ1 contains a covering of Y . Choose γ < δ2 such that
X < κρ·γ. Since δ2 is additively indecomposable, γ + δ1 < δ2. Since

30

Iρ·(γ+δ1) = Iρ·γ+ρ·δ1
contains a covering of Y . Moreover, X < κρ·γ < Iρ·(γ+δ1) < κρ·δ2.

∼= Iρ·δ1 by the First Recurrence Theorem for ≤1, Iρ·(γ+δ1)

Assume ρ · ωβ < θ1 and (∗) holds when β is replaced by β ′ for all β ′ < β.
Let α = ρ · ωβ. There exists λ < θ1 such that max1(κα) = κα + max1(κλ).
This is clear if α + 1 = θ1 (in which case max1(κα) = ∞) and follows from
Lemma 7.1 otherwise. By the induction hypothesis and the claim above,
max1(κβ ′) < max1(κλ) whenever β ′ < β. Therefore, β ≤ λ.

Argue by contradiction and assume β < λ. This implies max1(κβ) <

max1(κλ). Therefore, κα≤1κα + max1(κβ) + 1.

By Lemma 6.7, there exists R such that R is incompressible and max(Y ) =
max1(κβ). We may assume 0 ∈ R. Let Y = κα + R. Since 0 ∈ R, κα ∈ Y .
Since κα≤1κα +max1(κβ)+1, there is a covering ˜Y of Y contained in κα with
0 < ˜Y . Since κα≤1κα + max1(κβ), κα≤1ξ for all ξ ∈ Y . Letting µ be the
least element of ˜Y , this implies that µ≤1ξ for all ξ ∈ ˜Y which in turn implies
that ˜Y ⊆ Iα′ for some α′ < α. Since 0 < ˜Y , 0 < α′. Since ˜Y is closed, µ is di-
visible by ρ. By part 8 of Lemma 5.4, α′ is divisible by ρ. There are ordinals
γ ′ and β ′ such that α′ = ρ · (γ ′ + ωβ ′). Since α′ < α = ρ · ωβ, β ′ < β. By the
induction hypothesis, max1(κα′) = κα′ + max1(κβ ′). Let h be the covering of
Y onto ˜Y and deﬁne a function f on R by h(κα + χ) = κα′ + f (ξ) for χ ∈ Y .
Since h maps Y into Iα′, the range of f is contained in [0, max1(κβ ′)]. By
the Main Structural Lemma, [κα + 1, ∞) ∼= [1, ∞) and [κα′ + 1, ∞) ∼= [1, ∞).
This and the fact that h is a covering easily imply f is a covering. SInce
max1(κα′) < κα, this contradicts the fact that R is incompressible.
(cid:3)

Corollary 7.3 For any ordinals γ and β, if ρ · (γ + ωβ) < θ1 then

max1(κρ·(γ+ωβ )) = κρ·(γ+ωβ ) + max1(κβ)

Proof. Combine both the First and Second Recurrence Theorems for ≤1. (cid:3)

Corollary 7.4 If 0 < α < θ1 then κα≤1κα + κα iﬀ α is an epsilon number
(i.e. ωα = α) which is greater than ρ.
In particular, either θ1 = ∞ or
θ1 = θ + 1 where θ is an epsilon number greater than ρ.

Proof. Assume α < θ1 is a positive ordinal.

(⇒) Assume κα≤1κα + κα. By part 8 of Lemma 5.4, α = ρ · δ for some
limit ordinal δ. Therefore, ρ < α. There are ordinals γ and β such that β > 0

31

and δ = γ + ωβ. By the theorem, κα + κα ≤ max1(κα) = κα + max1(κβ).
Therefore, κα ≤ max1(κβ) implying α ≤ β. This implies

α = ρ · (γ + ωβ) ≥ ωβ ≥ ωα

Therefore, α = ωα i.e. α is an epsilon number.

(⇐) Assume α is an epsilon number greater than ρ. Since α = ρ · ωα,
the theorem implies that max1(κα) = κα + max1(κα). Therefore, κα · ω ≤
max1(κα) implying κα≤1κα · ω.
(cid:3)

The proof shows that κα≤1κα·ω when α < θ1 is an epsilon number greater
than ρ. In fact, κα≤1κα · (ω + 1) by the Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤2
from [5]. Moreover, max1(κα) = κα · (ω + 1) when α is the least epsilon
number greater than ρ.

8 The First Recurrence Theorem for ≤2

Recall that ρ is an arbitrary additively indecomposable ordinal.

In the case α is not an epsilon number greater than ρ, the ﬁrst corollary
to the Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤1 provides a description of Iα in
terms of the intervals Iα′ with α′ < α. We next study the structure of Iα by
considering its decomposition into intervals determined by ≤2 when α is an
epsilon number greater than ρ.

Theorem 8.1 (Recurrence Theorem for Small Intervals) Assume α <
θ1 is of the form ρ · λ where λ is inﬁnite and additively indecomposable. Also
assume κα divides δ ∈ ORD.

1. [0, δ] 6≤2 [δ + 1, δ + κα).
2. [1, κα] ∼= [δ + 1, δ + κα]

Proof. We will prove parts 1 and 2 simultaneously by induction on those δ
which are divisible by κα.

Assume δ is divisible by κα and conditions 1 and 2 hold for all δ′ < δ

with δ′ divisible by κα.

For δ = 0, both conditions are trivial. So, we may assume δ > 0. By
Lemma 6.1 and the induction hypothesis, for any ﬁnite closed Y ⊆ κα there
are coﬁnally many subsets of δ which are isomorphic to Y .

To show conditions 1 and 2 hold, let J be the collection of γ ∈ [1, κα]

such that

32

(a) [0, δ] 6≤2 [δ + 1, δ + γ)
(b) [δ + 1, δ + γ] ∼= [1, γ]

We will prove J = [1, κα] by induction. Suppose γ ∈ [1, κα] and γ ′ ∈ J
whenever 1 ≤ γ ′ < γ.

By the Main Structural Lemma, (b) follows from (a). To show that (a)
holds, argue by contradiction and let δ′ ≤ δ and γ ′ < γ with δ′ ≤2 δ + γ ′.
Choose α′ < α such that γ ′ < κα′. By Lemma 6.6, there exists incompressible
Y with max(Y ) = max1(κα′). In particular, [0, γ) does not contain a covering
of Y . Since the inductive hypothesis implies that [1, γ) ∼= [δ + 1, δ + γ),
[δ + 1, δ + γ) does not contain a covering of Y . As noted above, there are
coﬁnally many isomorphic copies of Y below δ and therefore, by part 1 of
Lemma 3.5, there are coﬁnally ˜Y below δ′ such that ˜Y is a covering of Y .
Since δ′≤2↑δ + γ, there are coﬁnally many coverings of Y below δ + γ –
contradiction.
(cid:3)

Corollary 8.2 Assume α + 1 < θ1. There exist δ and β with β < α such
that max1(κα) = κα · δ + max1(κβ).

Proof. The corollary follows from part 8 of Lemma 5.4 if α is not of the
form ρ · λ where λ is an inﬁnite limit ordinal. So, assume α = ρ · λ where
λ is a limit ordinal. The corollary follows from the ﬁrst corollary to the
Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤1 if λ is not additively indecomposable.
So, assume λ is additively indecomposable.

Choose δ divisible by κα such that κα ≤ δ ≤ max1(κα) < δ + κα. By part
2 of the theorem, [δ + 1, δ + κα) ∼= [1, κα). The corollary now follows by an
argument similar to that used for Lemma 7.1.
(cid:3)

The ﬁrst corollary of the Second Recurrence Theorem for ≤1 provides a
computation of the β in the corollary above in the case α is not an epsilon
number greater than ρ. We will not pursue the computation of λ further in
this paper.

Lemma 8.3 Assume α < θ1 is an epsilon number greater than ρ. If ν ∈ Iα
is divisible by κα and minimal with respect to ≤2 then max1(ν) = max1(κα).

Proof. Assume ν ∈ Iα is divisible by κα. Since ν ∈ Iα, max1(ν) ≤
max1(κα). We will show that for all ξ ∈ Iα, if ν ≤ ξ then ν≤1ξ. Argue
by induction on ξ.

33

Suppose ξ ∈ Iα, ν ≤ ξ and ν≤1ξ ′ for all ξ ′ ∈ [ν, ξ). Since ν≤1ν, we may
assume ν < ξ. If ξ is a limit ordinal then ν≤1ξ by part 2 of Lemma 3.8. So
we may assume ξ = η + 1 where η ≥ ν.

Suppose X ⊆ ν and Y ⊆ [ν, ξ) = [ν, η] are ﬁnite closed sets. Since κα≤1ξ,
there are coﬁnally many ˜Y below κα such that ˜Y is a covering of Y by part 1
of Lemma 3.5. By part 2 of the previous lemma, there are coﬁnally many ˜Y
below ν such that ˜Y is a covering of Y . Choose such a ˜Y with X < ˜Y . Since
ν is minimal with respect to ≤2 and ν≤1η, we must have [0, ν) 6≤2 [ν, η]. By
Lemma 3.9, this implies that X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ∪ Y .
(cid:3)

Lemma 8.4 Assume α < θ1 is an epsilon number greater than ρ. The
collection of ν ∈ Iα such that ν is divisible by κα and minimal with respect
to ≤2 is topologically closed.

Proof. Let A be a nonempty subset of the collection of ordinals ν ∈ Iα
which are divisible by κα and minimal with respect to ≤2. Let µ be the
least ξ such that ν ≤ ξ for all ν ∈ A. Clearly, µ is divisible by κα. To
show µ is minimal with repect to ≤2, argue by contradiction and suppose
τ <2 µ. There exists ν ∈ A such that τ < ν ≤ µ. By the previous lemma,
ν≤1max1(κα). Therefore, ν≤1µ. This implies that τ <2 ν – contradiction.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 8.5 Assume α < θ1 is an epsilon number greater than ρ. Deﬁne

να,ξ

(ξ < θ2(α) )

to be the enumeration of the elements of Iα which are divisible by κα and
minimal with respect to ≤2. When ξ+1 < θ2(α), deﬁne Jα,ξ to be [να,ξ, να,ξ+1).
If ξ +1 = θ2(α), deﬁne Jα,ξ to be Iα ∩[νξ, ∞). Deﬁne J α,ξ to be the topological
closure of Jα,ξ i.e. add the least proper upper bound of Jα,ξ if it is not already
in Jα,ξ.

The enumeration in the deﬁnition depends on the parameter ρ. Later,
when we need to make this dependence clear, we will write νρ
α,ξ for να,ξ and
θρ
2(α) for θ2(α). On the other hand, when α is clear from the context, we
will write νξ for να,ξ and θ2 for θ2(α). We treat the notation Jα,ξ and J α,ξ
similarly.

Notice that when ξ + 1 < θ2, J α,ξ = [νξ, νξ+1], and when ξ + 1 = θ2,

J α,ξ = Jα,ξ.

34

Lemma 8.6 Assume α < θ1 is an epsilon number greater than ρ.

Proof. Clearly, ν0 = κα. By part 1 of Lemma 3.6, max2(κα) = κα. This
establishes part 1.

Parts 2 and 3 follow from Lemma 8.4.
Parts 4 through 7 follow immediately from the deﬁnitions and Lemma

8.4.

Part 8 is a restatement of Lemma 8.3.

Claim. Assume δ is divisible by κα.

1. If δ≤2δ′ then δ′ is divisible by κα.

2. If δ′≤1δ then δ′ is divisible by κα.

3. If δ ∈ Iα then νξ≤2δ for some ξ < θ2.

Parts 1 and 2 follow from the Recurrence Theorem for Small Intervals.
For part 3, suppose δ ∈ Iα. There exists µ≤2δ which is minimal in ≤2. Since
µ≤1δ ∈ Iα, µ ∈ Iα. By part 2, µ is divisible by κα. Therefore, µ = νξ for
some ξ < θ2.

Parts 9 and 10 of the lemma follow easily from parts 1 and 3 of the claim

and part 4 of the lemma.

For part 11, assume ξ + 1 < θ2. Part 1 of the claim implies that max2(νξ)
is divisible by κα. Therefore, max2(νξ) + κα is the least ordinal greater
than max2(νξ) which is divisible by κα. By part 9 of the lemma, νξ+1 =
max2(νξ) + κα.

To see max2(νξ+1) = νξ+1 argue by contradiction and assume νξ+1 <2 δ.
By part 1 of Lemma 3.6, there exists γ such that γ <1 νξ+1 and max2(νξ) <
γ. By part 2 of the claim, γ is divisible by κα which contradicts νξ+1 =
max2(νξ) + κα.

For part 12, assume ξ < θ2 and max2(νξ) 6= ∞. Argue by contradic-
tion and assume ν ≤ max2(νξ) < δ and ν≤2δ. This implies ν≤1max2(νξ).
Clearly, ν, δ ∈ Iα. Part 1 of the claim implies max2(νξ) is divisible by κα.
By part 2 of the claim, ν is divisible by κα. By part 1 of the claim, δ is
divisible by κα. By part 10 of the lemma, ξ + 1 < θ2. By part 11, νξ+1 ≤ δ
contradicting part 4.

For part 13, assume ξ < θ2, µ is divisible by κα, χ < κα and γ is the

index of χ.

To establish part (a), assume µ + χ ∈ Jξ. Since the least element of Jξ is

νξ, νξ ≤ µ ≤ µ + Iγ.

36

First suppose ξ + 1 < θ2. In this case, Jξ = [νξ, νξ+1) and µ < νξ+1. Since

νξ+1 is divisible by κα, µ + Iγ < µ + κγ+1 < µ + κα ≤ νξ+1.

Now suppose ξ + 1 = θ2.

If α + 1 = θ1 then Jξ = [νξ, ∞) implying
µ + Iγ ⊆ Jξ. So, we may assume α + 1 < θ1. By Corollary 8.2, Iα = [κα, κα ·
δ + max1(κβ)) for some δ and β < α. Therefore, Jξ = [νξ, κα · δ + max1(κβ)].
If µ + χ < κα · δ the argument for the case ξ + 1 < θ2 shows µ + Iγ ⊆ Jξ.
So, we may assume κα · δ ≤ µ + χ. In this case κα · δ = µ and γ ≤ β easily
implying µ + Iγ ⊆ Jξ.

To establish part (b), assume µ+χ ∈ J ξ. If µ+χ ∈ Jξ then µ+Iγ ⊆ Jξ ⊆
J ξ by part (a). So, we may assume that µ + χ 6∈ Jξ. This implies ξ + 1 < θ2
and µ + χ = νξ+1. Since νξ+1 is divisible by κα, µ = νξ+1, χ = 0 and γ = 0.
Therefore, µ + Iγ = µ + I0 = µ + {0} = {µ} ⊆ J ξ.

For part 14, assume µ is a multiple of κα with νξ ≤ µ ∈ Iα. To show
νξ ≤ρ
2↑ µ, assume X is a ﬁnite ρ-closed subset of νξ and Y is a collection of
ﬁnite ρ-closed subsets of νξ which is coﬁnal in νξ such that X < Y whenever
Y ∈ Y and X ∪ Y1

∼=ρ X ∪ Y2 whenever Y1, Y2 ∈ Y.

Assume Y ∈ Y. We will show there exist coﬁnally many ﬁnite closed
subset ˜Y of µ such that X ∪ ˜Y is a covering of X ∪ Y . By part 8, νξ≤1µ. By
Lemma 3.10, we may assume that for each σ ∈ X there exists τ ∈ Y such
that σ ≤2 τ . By part 3 of Lemma 3.8, this assumption implies that if σ ∈ X
then σ ≤2 νξ. Since νξ is minimal in ≤2, X = ∅. Fix Y ∈ Y. Since κα ≤1 νξ,
there are coﬁnally many covering of Y below κα. Since µ is a multiple of κα,
RTSI implies there are coﬁnally many coverings of Y below µ.

Lemma 8.7 Assume α < θ1 is an epsilon number greater than ρ. The
following hold for ξ + 1 < θ2 and η < θ2.

1. Iα

∼= Iα ∩ [νξ+1, ∞).

2. ξ + 1 + η < θ2

3. νξ+1+η = max2(νξ) + νη

4. max2(νξ+1+η) = max2(νξ) + max2(νη)

Proof. By part 11 of the previous lemma and the Main Structural Lemma,
the map h(γ) = max2(νξ) + γ is an isomorphism of [1, ∞) and [max2(νξ) +
1, ∞).

Claim.

37

1. For β > 0, β is divisible by κα iﬀ h(β) is divisible by κα.

2. For β > 0 and k = 1, 2,

maxk(β) = ∞ iﬀ maxk(h(β)) = ∞

h(maxk(β)) = maxk(h(β))

and

if maxk(β) 6= ∞.

3. h(κα) = νξ+1

4. If max1(κα) 6= ∞ then h(max1(κα)) = max1(κα).

5. For β > 0, β ∈ Iα iﬀ h(β) ∈ Iα.

6. For β > 0, β is minimimal with respect to ≤2 iﬀ h(β) is minimal with

respect to ≤2.

7. For ζ < θ2, h(νζ) = νξ+1+ζ

By part 9 of the previous lemma, max2(νξ) is divisible by κα. Part 1 of
the claim follows (alternatively, one could use Lemma 5.8 which says κα is
additively indecomposable).

Part 2 follows from the fact h is an isomorphism.
For part 3, notice h(κα) = max2(νξ)+κα = νξ+1 by part 11 of the previous

lemma.

Since max1(νξ+1) = max1(κα) by part 8 of the previous lemma, part 4

follows from

h(max1(κα)) = max1(h(κα)) = max1(max2(νξ) + κα) = max1(νξ+1)

Part 5 follows from parts 3 and 4.
For part 6, suppose β > 0. First notice β is minimal with respect to ≤2
iﬀ β is minimal with respect to ≤2 in [1, ∞). Since h is an isomorphism, β
is minimal with respect to ≤2 in [1, ∞) iﬀ h(β) is minimal with respect to
≤2 in [max2(νξ) + 1, ∞). By part 12 of the previous lemma, h(β) is minimal
with respect to ≤2 in [max2(νξ) + 1, ∞) iﬀ h(β) is minimal with respect to
≤2.

38

By parts 1 and 3 through 6, h(νζ) (ζ < θ2) enumerates the ordinals which
are divisible by κα, minimal with respect to ≤2, in Iα and at least νξ+1. Since
νξ+1+ζ (ξ +1+ζ < θ2) enumerates the same family of ordinals, h(νζ) = νξ+1+ζ
for ζ < θ2.

This completes the proof of the claim.

Part 1 of the lemma follows from parts 3 and 4 of the claim and the fact

h is an isomorphism.

Parts 2 and 3 of the lemma follow from part 7 of the claim.
The following establishes part 4 of the lemma.

max2(νξ+1+η) = max2(h(νη))
= h(max2(νη))
= max2(νξ) + max2(νη)

(part 7 of the claim)
(part 2 of the claim)

Theorem 8.8 Assume α < θ1 is an epsilon number greater than ρ. Either
θ2 = ∞ or θ2 = θ + 1 for some inﬁnite additively indecomposable ordinal θ.

Proof. Assume θ2 6= ∞. By part 3 of Lemma 8.6, there exists an ordinal θ
such that θ2 = θ + 1. By Corollary 7.4, κα≤1κα + κα. By part 1 of Lemma
3.6, κα 6≤1 κα + κα. By part 7 of Lemma 8.6, θ 6= 0 (and ν1 = κα + κα by
parts 1 and 8 of Lemma 8.6). By part 2 of the previous lemma, ξ + 1 + θ = θ
whenever ξ + 1 ≤ θ. Since θ 6= 0, this implies that θ is inﬁnite and additively
indecomposable.
(cid:3)

Theorem 8.9 (First Recurrence Theorem for ≤2) Assume α < θ1 is an
∼= J η.
epsilon number greater than ρ. If ξ + 1 < θ2 and 0 < η < θ2 then J ξ+η
Moreover, J 0

∼= J 1.

Proof. As in the proof of the Lemma 8.7, part 11 of Lemma 8.6 and the Main
Structural Lemma imply the map h(γ) = max2(νξ) + γ is an isomorphism of
[1, ∞) and [max2(νξ) + 1, ∞). If η + 1 = θ2 then ξ + η = η by the previous
theorem from which the conclusion follows trivially. So, we may assume that
∼= J ξ+1+ζ for all ζ < θ2.
η + 1 < θ2. By parts 3 and 4 of Lemma 8.7, J ζ
∼= J 1.
When ξ = 0, we have J ζ
Choosing ζ such that η = 1 + ζ,

∼= J 1+ζ for all ζ < θ2. Choosing ζ = 0, J 0

J ξ+η = J ξ+1+ζ

∼= J ζ

∼= J 1+ζ = J η
