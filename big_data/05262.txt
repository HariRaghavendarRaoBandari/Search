Abstract

We calculate one-loop string amplitudes of open and closed strings with N = 1, 2, 4 supersymme-

try in four and six dimensions, by compactiﬁcation on Calabi-Yau and K3 orbifolds. In particular,

we develop a method to combine contributions from all spin structures for arbitrary number of

legs at minimal supersymmetry. Each amplitude is cast into a compact form by reorganizing the

kinematic building blocks and casting the worldsheet integrals in a basis. Infrared regularization

plays an important role to exhibit the expected factorization limits. We comment on implications

for the one-loop string eﬀective action.

Introduction

A signiﬁcant part of the work on string loop amplitudes has been performed in ten dimensions and for

maximal supersymmetry. A classic example is the 1982 Brink-Green-Schwarz calculation [1] of a 4-point

1-loop amplitude of gravitons or gauge ﬁelds. The state of the art in maximal supersymmetry has reached

the ﬁrst non-vanishing results at 3-loop order [2], made tractable by the manifestly supersymmetric pure

spinor formalism [3].

We will not focus on phenomenology in this paper, but clearly it is of great interest to develop the

state of the art of string eﬀective actions with minimal supersymmetry, as opposed to maximal. We

will argue that even at 1-loop order in minimal supersymmetry, there is much left to be understood

about string amplitudes. For fundamental problems like moduli stabilization, without which there can

be no reliable phenomenology1, the string eﬀective action should be calculated at least to 1-loop order,

1See for example the review [4]. From the vast literature, let us highlight [5] from the string side and more recently [6]

from the phenomenology side as two illustrative examples of the crucial role of moduli stabilization in phenomenology.

as some stabilization eﬀects are quantum-mechanical. Half-maximal supersymmetry provides a useful

step on the way to minimal supersymmetry.

In this paper we study type II string compactiﬁcations on K3 and Calabi-Yau (toroidal) orbifolds that

break supersymmetry down to half-maximal or quarter-maximal. For closed strings, quarter-maximal

amounts to 8 supercharges which is N = 2 supersymmetry in D = 4 terminology. The basic technology

to compute all 1-loop amplitudes in type IIB Calabi-Yau orbifolds (and orientifolds) has in principle

been available for decades, but various technical obstacles have prevented progress.

Impressive progress on the gauge boson 1-loop 4-point amplitude in quarter- and half-maximal

supersymmetry was made in 2006 [7], but in a form that was diﬃcult to process further, for example to

check supersymmetry Ward identities. Last year, this calculation was simpliﬁed [8] by specializing the

external polarizations to spinor-helicity variables at an early stage of the calculation.

Recently, work on the graviton 1-loop 4-point amplitude for half-maximal K3× T 2 was presented in
[9, 10]. In contrast to those papers, we ﬁrst perform the sum over the spin structures of the Ramond-

Neveu-Schwarz (RNS) formalism and will later perform the ﬁeld-theory limit. Also, in addition to

K3 compactiﬁcation to half-maximal supersymmetry, we also consider closed strings in Calabi-Yau

compactiﬁcation to quarter-maximal supersymmetry.

In this paper, we will approach the problems in the aforementioned papers from a new angle and

present substantial generalizations of the 1-loop amplitudes discussed in the literature so far. Our main

results are the methods for all-multiplicity spin sums in section 3.3.3, the open-string 3-point and 4-

point 1-loop amplitudes (5.20) and (5.21), and the closed-string 3-point and 4-point 1-loop amplitudes

(6.27) and (6.32). The precise improvements on previous work will be clariﬁed in those sections. The

closed string expressions are valid for generic massless NSNS external states (graviton, dilaton, and

antisymmetric tensor).

One key aspect of these results is that connections between 1-loop amplitudes with diﬀerent amounts

of supersymmetry are revealed. First, the parity-even kinematic factors of open-string n-point ampli-

tudes for half-maximal and quarter-maximal supersymmetry are identical. The amplitudes are only

distinguished by the explicit functions of worldsheet moduli, see (4.43). Second, as will be detailed in

section 5, the structure of half-maximal open-string amplitudes at multiplicity n is very similar to that

of their maximally supersymmetric counterparts at multiplicity n + 2. Finally, the progress we made

on open-string amplitudes reverberates in our closed-string amplitudes in section 6, where the simpli-

ﬁed expression (6.32) for the 4-point function closely resembles the maximally supersymmetric 6-point

amplitude of [11].

2 Superstring eﬀective action

We will not extract details of the eﬀective action in this paper, but here is a short review of expectations

and motivations.

The closed-string sector is somewhat more universal than the open-string sector, so let us begin

there, but most of our comments extend to open strings. In D = 10 the leading correction to the type
IIB string eﬀective action appears at order α(cid:48)3. Even this leading correction is not completely known
(especially for the RR sector), but many pieces are well understood. The gravitational part of the type

IIB action in Einstein frame is (see e.g. [12, 13, 14, 15] for some original references, or [16, 17, 18] for

contemporary work)

where R4 is schematic for index contractions with the well-known tensor structure t8t8 + 1010 (see e.g.

[19]). There is a simple way to include also the other massless NSNS ﬁelds: the Kalb-Ramond B-ﬁeld

and dilaton. As discussed e.g. by [20] in 1986, and more recently in e.g. [16, 17, 18], the idea is to shift
the Riemann tensor by ∇H and ∇∇φ as

where κ is the gravitational coupling, H is the NSNS 3-form ﬁeld strength and φ is the dilaton. The

geometric interpretation of this shift as torsion is discussed for example in [17].
(In eq. (2.2) and
throughout this work, vector indices m = 0, 1, . . . , D − 1 are taken as m, n, p, q, . . . from the middle
of the latin alphabet, where the number D of dimensions will be clear from context.) We have not

discussed terms that depend on RR ﬁelds, that we comment on in the outlook.

The best-understood type IIB coeﬃcient in D = 10 is the one above, of the R4 term [15],

After compactiﬁcation to e.g. D = 4 on some nontrivial (non-toroidal) space, much less is known than in

D = 10, since as discussed above, the requisite amplitudes for the less-than-maximal type II superstring

have not been studied systematically until recently. (There is substantial literature on related issues in

the heterotic string, some of which we review below.) As an illustration of the great simpliﬁcations of

maximal supersymmetry, in (2.4) we see that there are no perturbative corrections beyond one loop.

2For a recent review of the systematics of such expansions, also with toroidal compactiﬁcation, consult [21].

This non-renormalization theorem does not extend to minimal supersymmetry. More relevant for our
purposes is that in maximal supersymmetry, the α(cid:48)3R4 correction is the leading-order α(cid:48) correction in
a ﬂat background. With minimal supersymmetry one generically expects all the lower-order terms to
appear: R, α(cid:48)R2 and possibly (see below) α(cid:48)2R3, both at tree level and at loop order. So with less
supersymmetry, the R4 correction above that was leading in maximal supersymmetry becomes sub-sub-
sub-leading in the α(cid:48)-expansion:

(cid:90)

S1/4 =

(2.5)

where the subscript 1/4 means “quarter-supersymmetric”. The loop-corrected coeﬃcients ∆i in gen-

eral depend on the moduli, and one can extract aspects of this dependence from the one-loop string

amplitudes in this paper. Until recently this would not have been feasible.

Again, similar comments hold for open strings and string corrections to gauge ﬁeld eﬀective actions.

2.1 Tree-level: review
As summarized above, in the type II string eﬀective action in D = 10 there is the famous α(cid:48)3R4 term
that ﬁrst appears at string tree-level (sphere diagram). The lower powers α(cid:48)R2 and α(cid:48)2R3 are forbidden
by 32 supercharges. By contrast, the heterotic string in D = 10 with 16 supercharges is known to have

a tree-level R2 term [20], unlike in type II. This can be explained by “double copy” (see e.g. [23]): there
is a tree-level α(cid:48)F 3 term on the purely bosonic side of the heterotic string, and no α(cid:48)F 3 term on the
supersymmetric side. “Multiplying out” two vectors to give a graviton in the sense of double-copy, one
obtains a tree-level subleading term α(cid:48)R2 in the heterotic string in D = 10. So an α(cid:48)R2 term is allowed
by 16 supercharges, but it is not required. For type II compactiﬁed on K3, Antoniadis et al. [19] explain

(p.4) that there is no tree-level R2 term.

The cubic curvature R3 terms are absent in all these theories. One of the ﬁrst arguments about this

was by explicit calculation [24], see also the next section.

Tree-level interactions of open and closed superstrings involve multiple zeta values (MZVs) upon
α(cid:48)-expansion, a ﬁrst hint being the above single-zeta value in α(cid:48)3ζ(3)R4. In the closed-string sector,
DmRn couplings in [25, 26] can be traced back to the all-multiplicity results for open-string trees in

[27, 28] through the KLT relations [29] which imply identical graviton interactions in type IIB and

type IIA theory. The patterns of MZVs and covariant derivatives can then be generated from the

Drinfeld associator [30]. The study of DmRn interactions is important to assess the UV behavior3 of

3Based on a symmetry analysis of DmRn matrix elements initiated in [31], any counterterm with the mass dimension of
D6R4 and below were ruled out, guaranteeing UV-ﬁniteness of four-dimensional N = 8 supergravity up to and including

6 loops [32].

N = 8 supergravity in four dimensions by testing their compatibility with its E7(7) duality symmetry

[31, 33, 34, 32].

As initially observed in [25], systematic cancellations obscured by the KLT relations occur when

assembling DmRn interactions from open-string amplitudes [26], leaving for instance only one tree-level

interaction of type DmRn at the mass dimensions of D2mR4 with m = 0, 2, 3, 4, 5. The selection rules for

the accompanying MZVs were identiﬁed with the single-valued projection [35]. Also beyond tree level,
there is evidence that the single-valued MZVs and polylogarithms govern the closed-string α(cid:48)-expansion
[36, 37].

In the heterotic theory, an interesting tree-level connection between single-trace interactions in the

gauge-sector and the type I superstring was found in [38], again based on the single-valued projection

of MZVs. In the gravitational sector of the heterotic string, half-maximal supersymmetry allows for

additional DmRn interactions absent for the superstring whose implications for counterterms of N = 4

supergravity were studied in [39]. At a given mass dimension, the DmRn interactions accompanied by

MZVs of highest transcendental weight are universal to the heterotic and type II theories [40], and this

universality of the leading-transcendental part in fact carries over to the bosonic open and closed string.

Accordingly, the MZVs along with non-universal DmRn interactions of the heterotic string starting

with R2 have lower transcendental weight as compared to their universal counterparts [40], suggesting

a classiﬁcation by weight at each mass dimension.

2.2 Factorization and ambiguities: tree level and 1 loop

The Gross-Sloan paper from 1986 mentioned above [20] contains a detailed discussion of ﬁeld theory pole

subtractions, a key piece in the machinery of extracting an eﬀective ﬁeld theory from string amplitudes.

For less than maximal supersymmetry, the 4-point string amplitudes at 1-loop order factorizes onto 3-

point vertices, as drawn in ﬁg. 1. Reducible ﬁeld-theory diagrams with the gravitational 3-point vertices

Figure 1: Factorization onto (tree-level 3-point) × (propagator) × (1-loop 3-point).

need to be subtracted from the low-energy limit of the string amplitude to isolate the irreducible ﬁeld-

theory 4-point coupling corresponding to D2mR4 terms in the eﬀective action. This is a laborious

procedure. As emphasized in [42], if we are interested in fewer powers of the Riemann tensor like R2

and R3, we could in principle extract them from 2-point or 3-point functions, where one could expect

7

s12!0there to be no reducible contributions at all. This can be taken as a general argument that for eﬃcient

computation one should strive to compute the lowest number of external legs that can probe the term

of interest in the eﬀective action.

However, 2-point and 3-point functions of massless states vanish on-shell unless they are infrared-

regularized, as we review in appendix C. This regularization is a key point in this paper and we will

discuss it in more detail in section 4.2. Somewhat surprisingly, we will see that the same regularization

procedure should also be applied to n-point functions for any n, to exhibit the expected factorizations

in the spirit of this section.

A related issue is that since our string amplitudes are on-shell, there are ambiguities coming from ﬁeld
redeﬁnitions, a typical example being a shift of the graviton hmn → hmn+Rmn that can shuﬄe coeﬃcients
between the three terms RmnpqRmnpq, RmnRmn and R2 in the string eﬀective action, as explained for

example in [43]. The coeﬃcients are moduli- and background-dependent, so a more general background

could lift some of these degeneracies. We discuss this issue a little further in section 6.5.1 and appendix

C, but the main focus of this paper is the underlying string amplitudes and not the explicit construction

of a string eﬀective action.

So let us return to the factorization of the closed-string 4-point 1-loop amplitude as illustrated in ﬁg.

1. (The following discussion will be general, but a few explicit expressions corresponding to the ﬁgures

drawn here are given in appendix B.) The moduli space of string loop amplitudes is interesting already

in this fairly simple example. As a ﬁrst question, in the factorization limit in ﬁg. 1, which of the two

more speciﬁc diagrams in ﬁg. 2 is actually realized? By conformal invariance of the worldsheet theory,

we can always factor oﬀ a sphere from a bulk point on the worldsheet. When we draw this sphere

explicitly as in ﬁg. 2, we mean that the two external states on the left part of each diagram are closer to

each other than to any other vertex operator4. In the worldsheet computation, this arises from a delta

function of two punctures along with a propagator, caused by the collision of vertex operators. Now, we

will encounter situations where an inverse propagator is generated from the contractions among vertex

operators. If this cancels the propagator that arose with the delta function, we draw the diagram in the

left panel of ﬁg. 2. If the propagator is uncancelled, we draw it explicitly as in the right panel of ﬁg. 2.

In both diagrams in ﬁg. 2, the delta function has reduced the number of integrations over punctures by

one, so the moduli space of the remaining 1-loop integral is that of a 3-point 1-loop torus diagram, but

where one of the external momenta is the sum k1 + k2 of momenta of the two states on the left side of

the 4-point diagram. Unlike individual momenta of massless states, this sum is not constrained to be

4The moduli space of superstring amplitudes in ﬁgures like in this section is discussed more systematically in for

example [44], for open strings in for example [45] and more recent discussions include Witten’s extensive notes [46]. We

admit that the qualiﬁcation “closer to each other” restricts us to some class of worldsheet metrics.

lightlike: (k1 + k2)2 (cid:54)= 0. In ﬁeld theory the right side is then called a 1-mass triangle, but we emphasize
that we have not taken a ﬁeld-theory limit yet.

Analogously, we can ask whether there are any 1-mass bubbles, i.e. whether there is further factor-

ization of the subdiagram on the right of ﬁg. 2 (3-point 1-loop torus). As indicated in ﬁg. 3, we ﬁnd that

there is always a Mandelstam variable in the numerator that oﬀsets the propagator closest to the torus,

so this propagator always collapses to a point. This is important since an actual double factorization

Figure 3: Collapse of speciﬁc propagator avoids double factorization limit.

limit would have generated a 3-particle propagator (k1 + k2 + k3)−2 = (−k4)−2 which is in fact infrared

divergent in the 4-particle momentum phase space. The two spheres in the diagram on the right in ﬁg.

3 each represent a delta function from a particular region in moduli space, so this leaves one integration

over a puncture, as appropriate for a torus 2-point function with one ﬁxed vertex operator.

In the

ﬁeld-theory limit, this string amplitude will indeed generate a 1-mass bubble.

Factorization in the ﬁeld-theory limit is an interesting topic in its own right, and will be discussed

in a companion paper [47].

The above discussion was quite detailed, so let us make one broader statement, that we will explain

in more detail in later sections. In maximal supersymmetry, it is well-known that the factorization of

the 4-point function as in ﬁg. 1 does not occur (i.e. has zero residue). In fact, the number of successive
factorizations of an n-point function in maximal supersymmetry is n − 4. We will ﬁnd that for half-
maximal supersymmetry as well as parity-even contributions to 1-loop amplitudes in quarter-maximal
supersymmetry, this number is n − 2, as we have illustrated in the ﬁgures in this section. Parity-odd
terms in quarter-maximal require a reﬁned analysis, and preliminary arguments in later sections suggest
n − 3 successive factorizations for open strings and n − 2 for closed strings.

string in D = 10 (or on T 4), one would expect that supersymmetry would allow R2. The details are

interesting: it turns that the 1-loop correction to R2 vanishes in IIB on K3 but does not vanish in IIA

on K3. See for example [42, 19] and especially [48] as well as section 6.3 for a review of this string

amplitude computation. From the supergravity point of view, [19] explains the vanishing of 1-loop R2

corrections in the D = 6 IIB string theory on K3 from reduction of the ten-dimensional 1-loop term
(t8t8 ± 1010)R4, where the relative sign gives cancellation in IIB but not IIA. There is also a duality
argument: for IIA on K3 there should be a 1-loop R2 correction but no tree-level R2, because in heterotic

on T 4 there is a tree-level R2 (as discussed above) and no 1-loop R2, and they should be exchanged by

heterotic-IIA duality [19].5 These three arguments illustrate the variety of techniques that have been

developed for half-maximal supersymmetry.

The previous discussion concerned D = 6. Compactiﬁcation of type II on K3 × T 2 to D = 4 is

discussed in [52, 48, 19], where the authors calculate moduli-dependent couplings like

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

d4x√−g ∆(U )R2

(IIB) ,

d4x√−g ∆(T )R2

(IIA) ,

(2.6)

where U is the complex structure and T is the K¨ahler modulus of the 2-torus, and they are exchanged

by T-duality. Note that despite having the same amount of supersymmetry as in IIB on K3 above,

compactiﬁcation to D = 4 on this 2-torus allows an R2 term in IIB. The authors of [48] argue that

in the decompactiﬁcation limit of the 2-torus, the coeﬃcient would need to contain some power of the

K¨ahler modulus T of the 2-torus to survive the large-torus limit, and ∆(U ) does not. This recovers the

vanishing of the R2 term in D = 6 for IIB and the non-vanishing for IIA.

5For an impressive example of this type of argument in heterotic-type I duality, see [50, 51].

Finally, there is a fairly detailed discussion of the heterotic 1-loop R2 correction in [43], where the

non-renormalization of the Einstein-Hilbert action is also discussed. See e.g. [53] for previous work and

[54] for a useful summary of some of the older literature.

On to R3 corrections. Reduction of R4 from D = 10 on K3 or Calabi-Yau produces contractions of

the schematic form (Rexternal)3Rinternal, where Rinternal leaves no room for anything else than the Ricci

scalar of the compactiﬁcation manifold, which vanishes by Ricci-ﬂatness. There is in fact a general

superspace argument that no superinvariant containing R3 as bosonic component can be constructed

(see for example [55], that refers to [56, 57, 58]).

As is clear from (2.1) together with (2.2), there can be R3 terms in nontrivial backgrounds, like ﬂux

backgrounds or internal dilaton gradients.

Finally, string loop corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action in quarter-maximal supersymmetry

were studied using the background ﬁeld method in [59, 60]. Amplitude calculations of this correction

was discussed recently in [61]6 which builds on, corrects and extends results from [60, 62, 63]. These

results are all extracted from infrared-regularized low-point functions, in the strong sense that we discuss

in detail in section 4.2. It would be desirable to compare with our results, though we do not do so in detail

in this paper. The general conclusion from these papers is as expected from the eﬀective supergravity

discussion in [19], section 5: there is a 1-loop correction to R in type II on Calabi-Yau. It descends from

the 1010 term in (2.1), and the relative sign of the tree-level and 1-loop correction to R in type IIA is

the opposite to that of type IIB. For completeness, let us also mention that there is a correction to R

in type IIB orientifolds on K3 [64], which is also quarter-maximal due to the orientifolding.

Covariant derivatives DmRn of Riemann tensors have also been studied at loop level.

In ten-

dimensional type IIB theory, S-duality was exploited to determine the full moduli-dependent coeﬃcients

of the D4R4 [65] and D6R4 [66] interactions, including their non-perturbative completions. S-duality

based predictions for the 2-loop and 3-loop coeﬃcient of D6R4 [67] were conﬁrmed by the amplitude

computations of [68] and [2], also see [69] for D2R5 at two loops.

The amplitude calculations of this paper culminate in the compact expression (6.32) for the half-

maximal 1-loop amplitude involving four NSNS sector states in type IIB and type IIA. We lay some
foundations for a systematic investigation of 1-loop D2nRm≤4 couplings in half-maximal type II com-
pactiﬁcations by identifying the gauge-invariant “seeds” in their matrix elements.

Here we have focused mostly on gravitational corrections. Other NSNS corrections involving B ﬁelds

and dilatons have been studied somewhat less, but were discussed for example in [17, 18], and our results

here are equally relevant for those loop corrections. We comment on RR ﬁelds in the conclusions.

6This paper is mostly about orientifolds, but the torus amplitude only diﬀers by a factor of 1/2 from the parent theory.

3 Amplitude prescriptions and spin sums

In this section we deﬁne the computations that will occupy us for the remainder of the paper, including

eﬃcient techniques to sum over spin structures of the worldsheet spinors. We study compactiﬁcations
of type I and type II superstrings on certain ZN orbifolds illustrated in ﬁg. 4 that yield half-maximal
and quarter-maximal supersymmetry. This is textbook material (see e.g. [41, 70, 71, 72]), but before

launching into the detailed prescriptions, we give a quick review.

3.1 Orbifolds

We will consider generic supersymmetric orbifolds of the form T 4/ZN , T 4/ZN × T 2 or T 6/ZN .7 The
orbifold group ZN is a discrete subset of the rotation group. One identiﬁes points in spacetime that are
related by the ZN action. With complexiﬁed string coordinates Zj = X 2j+2 + UjX 2j+3, where j = 1, 2, 3
and Uj is the complex structure of the jth 2-torus, the discrete orbifold rotation is diagonal:

ΘkZj = e2πikvj Zj .

(3.1)

The rational numbers vj are such that ΘN = 1 (or occasionally one allows −1), and they satisfy
v1 + v2 + v3 = 0 to preserve some supersymmetry, see table 2 below for examples.8 We give a few

D = 10 by inserting a projector(cid:80)N−1

examples of vi at the end of this section. An orbifold theory is obtained from a “parent” theory in
k=0 Θk/N in amplitude trace computations and including requisite
lattice sums. The power k in the trace is called the sector of the orbifold. The identiﬁcation of points in
spacetime that are related by the ZN action can create conical singularities at ﬁxed points of the orbifold
action, as in ﬁg. 4. One can also mix in the worldsheet parity operation in the above orbifold group to

Figure 4: Orbifold compactiﬁcation: identiﬁcation under ZN creates a conical singularity.
The orbifold twist kv (that we will call γ, see eq. (3.37)) will occur in all our amplitudes.

make an orientifold, in the sense that type I (open+closed strings) in D = 10 is an orientifold of type

7We will assume factorizable tori T 4 = (T 2)2 and T 6 = (T 2)3, but giving up this assumption or generalizing to other

orbifolds such as ZM × ZN or more general groups should be straightforward.

8A simple way to see this is to use the oscillator notation for gamma matrices, see e.g. Appendix B of [41].

the orientifold plane. In noncompact models, one can get away without orientifolding, but in compact

models, there is some additional work to compute the M¨obius strip and Klein bottle amplitudes that

might be needed for speciﬁc consistent string models, which we postpone to future work. We will only

consider annulus and torus amplitudes in this paper, but the key simpliﬁcations of the integrands should

carry over straightforwardly to the remaining topologies. (We note that for closed strings, our torus

amplitudes will be consistent by themselves, but for model-building one might want to orientifold also

for closed strings, to allow moduli stabilization in minimal supergravity.)

3.2 Open-string prescriptions

One-loop scattering amplitudes among open-string states receive contributions from cylinder and M¨obius-

strip diagrams. In this work, we will discuss the planar cylinder (annulus) with modular parameter τ2 as

a representative diagram where all external states are inserted on the same boundary component, and

the corresponding color factor is a single-trace of gauge-group generators. In a parametrization of the
non-empty cylinder boundary via purely imaginary coordinates zi with 0 ≤ Im (zi) ≤ τ2, the universal
n-point open-string integration measure will be denoted by

(3.2)

We have incorporated the regularized external volume VD, the order N of the orbifold ZN as well as
the ubiquitous Koba–Nielsen factor Πn of eq. (4.5) below, which arises from the plane-wave factors of

vertex operators, see section 4.1. The measure (3.2) with modular parameter τ2 can straightforwardly

be adjusted to the remaining worldsheet topologies, and the delta-function δ(z1) ﬁxes the translation

invariance of genus-one surfaces, by ﬁxing one puncture to the origin. The number D of uncompactiﬁed

spacetime dimensions is denoted as a superscript of dµD

12...n, and the subscript 12 . . . n refers to the cyclic
ordering of the open-string states along the boundary as well as the trace-ordering of the accompanying

color factor.

3.2.1 Half-maximal supersymmetry

If one of the twist vector entries vanishes but the other two are nonzero, say v3 = 0 and therefore
v1 = −v2 as in table 2, the orbifold only breaks half of the supersymmetries. These orbifolds can be
characterized by a single rational real number v that enters the partition functions through the vector
(cid:126)vk ≡ k(v,−v). For brevity we will mostly discuss half-maximally supersymmetric orbifolds in their
maximal spacetime dimension D = 6, i.e. arising from compactiﬁcation from D = 10 on T 4/ZN , which
are special points in the moduli space of K3 manifolds. The one-loop amplitude of n gauge bosons in

this setting is given by (for textbook examples, see e.g. [72])

where Γ(n)C denotes lattice sums over n-dimensional internal momenta, the subscript “1/2” means ”half-
maximal” and the generalities of the constants ˆχk = −[sin(πkv)/π]2 are explained in appendix A.
The external-state information is encoded in the integrands I... whose dependence on the integration
variables τ2 and zi of the measure (3.2) will usually be suppressed. The subscripts “max” or “1/2”

distinguish orbifold sectors that preserve all or half the supersymmetries, respectively. While the max-

imally supersymmetric integrand is parity-even9, the half-maximal integrand receives both parity-even

and parity-odd contributions labelled by superscripts e and o. We write

In,1/2((cid:126)vk) ≡ I e

(3.4)

where (cid:126)vk highlights the dependence of the parity-even contribution on non-trivial orbifold sectors, i.e. on

the internal partition function. The dependence of parity-odd integrands on orbifold twists (cid:126)vk cancels

between the contributions to the partition function due to worldsheet bosons and worldsheet fermions

in the odd spin structure. Explicitly, we have

gauge-bosons will be written down in (4.1). The maximally supersymmetric integrand (3.5) has been

discussed in many places of the literature including [1, 73, 51] and can be obtained from pure spinor
computations such as [74, 75, 11] upon dimensional reduction. For the (n ≤ 4)-point amplitudes under
discussions, the result is [1]

with the D-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol on the right-hand side. The dependence on the position z0
of P (+1) drops out on kinematic grounds, as expected from general arguments (see e.g. [77, 41]), which

we check in detail in appendix D. Note that the expression (3.3) for half-maximal amplitudes in D = 6
straightforwardly generalizes to D = 4, i.e. compactiﬁcation on K3 × T 2 instead of just K3,

Similarly to the maximally supersymmetric integrand, when there are internal directions that are un-

aﬀected by the orbifold rotation, the parity-odd contribution vanishes for external excitations. To save

writing, we will mainly give D = 6 expressions, but the point here was to illustrate that the extrapolation

is trivial, before performing τ integrals.

3.2.2 Quarter-maximal supersymmetry

A similar prescription applies to orbifolds with quarter-maximal supersymmetry which we will discuss

in their maximal spacetime dimension D = 4. The quarter-maximal counterpart of (3.3),

contains two kinds of lattice sums Γ(6)C , Γ(2)C , and the twist vector is (cid:126)vk = k(v1, v2, v3) with v1 +v2 +v3 = 0.
Half-maximal contributions arise in orbifold models where one of the three internal tori is ﬁxed under
the action of some orbifold sectors, e.g. if ΘkZ3 = Z3 for some k (i.e. kv3 ∈ Z). In this case kv1 = kv2,
and I e

n,1/2((cid:126)vk) is determined by (3.6) with v → v1.

The quarter-maximal integrand contains parity-even and parity-odd contributions,

n,1/4((cid:126)vk) + I o

3.3 Spin sums

A major challenge in the evaluation of string amplitudes with half- and quarter-maximal supersymmetry

is to perform the spin sums in the parity-even integrands (3.6) and (3.13). As elaborated in section 4.1,
the worldsheet spinors in vertex operators V (0)

cause the correlators to depend on the spin structure ν

(3.14)

Individual sectors with ν = 2, 3, 4 contain spurious worldsheet singularities that cancel upon summation,

as a consequence of supersymmetry. Such spurious singularities are an inconvenient feature of the RNS

formalism, and their cancellation in maximally supersymmetric cases can be manifested through the

techniques of [73, 78]. In this section, we will demonstrate that the method of the references can be

adapted to address situations with reduced supersymmetry as well.

3.3.1 Worldsheet functions

We follow the notation of [78] where a doubly-periodic function f (n) for each non-negative integer n is

deﬁned by a non-holomorphic Kronecker-Eisenstein series

Note that f (1) is the only singular term of (3.15) with a simple pole at the origin as well as its translations
z = n + mτ with m, n ∈ Z. For ease of notation, the dependence on the modular parameter τ will be
suppressed in the following.

We note in passing that Ω(z, α, τ ) is closely related to the twisted fermion Green’s function, which is

in turn a nonholomorphic Eisenstein-Kronecker function E(k)

s (w, z, τ ), as discussed for example in [79].

We note that there, w has direct interpretation as a twist of external orbifold-charged states, while here

α is a formal expansion parameter.

3.3.2 Maximal supersymmetry

We see that without resorting to speciﬁc Riemann identities for large numbers of theta functions, these

results let us write relatively compact expressions for integrands up to at least 10 external states without

too much eﬀort, incorporating the cancellations mentioned above.

3.3.3 Reduced supersymmetry

The results in the maximally supersymmetric sector that we reviewed above will now be extended to the

most general spin sum in half-maximal and quarter-maximal amplitudes (3.3) and (3.11). The key idea

is to rewrite the orbifold-twisted partition functions (which reﬂect reduced supersymmetry) in terms of

fermion Green’s functions with the twist as an insertion (which “uses up” additional external states).

To this end, we rewrite (3.6) and (3.13) by pulling out a factor like that of the maximal case (3.18) by

[80]. The associated xj-dependence in GN≥9 can be cast into a convenient form through the notation

In order to avoid proliferation of factors k, we introduce the shorthands

γ ≡ kv ,

γj ≡ kvj ,

γ1 + γ2 + γ3 = 0

for the orbifold twists. The expressions can be identiﬁed with the prototype spin sum (3.18) from the
maximal case by viewing γ,−γ as xn+1, xn+2 and γ1, γ2, γ3 as xn+1, xn+2, xn+3, respectively. They pre-
serve the requirement on the xj to sum to zero, and they additionally imply that subsets of the arguments
in the enlarged Gn+2,Gn+3 add up to zero. As a convenient way to explore the resulting cancellations,
we rewrite the expressions in (3.35) and (3.36) such as to manifest the symmetries Sν(−x) = −Sν(x) of
Szeg¨o kernels, and exploit f (n)(−x) = (−1)nf (n)(x):

As a result, the γ-dependence in the half-maximal (3.38) conspires to functions of even modular weight,

More generally, the γ-dependence in the results (3.38) and (3.39) is organized in terms of Vn(. . .) from

F (n)
1/2(γ) ≡ Vn(γ,−γ) ,

F (n)
1/4(γj) ≡ Vn(γ1, γ2, γ3)

(3.44)

with appropriate parity for n. With these deﬁnitions and the functions Vn(x1, . . . , xn) of worldsheet

positions in (3.25) to (3.28), the spin sums for reduced supersymmetry can be evaluated as

G2+2(γ,−γ, x1, x2) = 1

1/2(γ) + V2(x1, . . . , x4)

G2+3(γ,−γ, x1, x2, x3) = V1(x1, x2, x3) = f (1)(x1) + f (1)(x2) + f (1)(x3)

which suﬃces for eight-point amplitudes in half-maximal compactiﬁcations. Comparing to results de-
rived by standard methods, the ﬁrst three are well-known: G2+2 comes from two fermion bilinears after
so-called “spin sum collapse”, using a standard theta function identity whose proof is outlined for exam-
ple in [81], eqs. (120)-(132). To obtain G2+3 from three fermion bilinears, one adapts a calculation from
[7], in particular their eq. (3.37) that reads Sν(x13)Sν(x23) = Sν(x12)V1(x1, x2, x3) + ∂xSν(x12). While
similar methods were used in [51, 7] to determine G2+4, we are not aware of explicit results for G2+n with
n ≥ 5 in the literature.

With standard methods, G3+2 has been computed in the spin sum for two fermion bilinears, and the
proof of the required spin sum identity is outlined for example in [81], eq. (130). Note that F (1)
1/4 in G3+2
is reminiscient of V1 above but is independent of xi, just like for the two-fermion-bilinear piece in the

half-maximal case. With three and four fermion bilinears, computations in [51, 7] can be adapted to
yield G3+3 and G3+4 above, but starting from G3+5 we believe the results are new.

In addition to new explicit results, we emphasize the general applicability of this method. As an
example, the following observation would be diﬃcult to make without our strategy. For n ≥ 2, the
structure of Vk(x1, . . . , xn) is obviously identical in the above expressions for G2+n and G3+n. If 1 = F (0)
is inserted in each term of G2+n without an extra factor of F (k(cid:54)=0)

1/2
, the correspondence between (3.45) to

1/2

(3.50) and (3.52) to (3.57) can be summarized by

G3+n(γ1, γ2, γ3, , x1, . . . , xn) = G2+n(γ,−γ, , x1, . . . , xn)

1/2(γ)→F (k+1)

.

(γj )

(3.58)

Hence, the resulting scattering amplitudes in half-maximal and quarter-maximal compactiﬁcations have

the same structure in the parity-even sector, i.e. their integrands can be straightforwardly mapped into
each other upon replacing F (k)

(γj). However, the parity-odd contributions to half-maximal

1/2(γ) → F (k+1)

1/4

and quarter-maximal cases will exhibit diﬀerences as we will comment on in sections 4.7, 4.8 and 6.6.

3.4 Closed-string prescriptions

In this section, we recall the starting point for one-loop closed-string amplitudes with non-maximal

supersymmetry, speciﬁcally we consider half-maximal and quarter-maximal compactiﬁcations of type IIA

and type IIB theories. Similar to the open-string integration measure (3.2), we capture the integration

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)F (k)

over inequivalent worldsheets of torus topology by the closed-string measure

(3.59)

As before, the regularized external volume VD, the order N of the orbifold group ZN , and the Koba–
Nielsen factor Πn in (4.5) are incorporated for later convenience. By modular invariance, the torus
modulus τ is integrated over the fundamental domain F deﬁned by |Re (τ )| ≤ 1
2 and |τ| ≥ 1. External-
state insertions zi are integrated over the torus T (τ ) parametrized by the parallelogram in C that is
bounded by 0, 1, τ + 1, τ .

3.4.1 Half-maximal supersymmetry

where Γ(n)T denotes n-dimensional closed-strings lattice sums, and ˆχk,k(cid:48) are constant coeﬃcients that
encode the degeneracies of orbifold-charged (“twisted”) states, see appendix A and e.g. [118]. Similarly
as for open strings, the maximally supersymmetric integrand Jn,max can only receive contributions
from the even-even sector. By contrast, the half-maximal integrand in general receives non-trivial

contributions from all parity sectors, we write

Jn,1/2((cid:126)vk,k(cid:48)) = J e,˜e

n,1/2((cid:126)vk,k(cid:48)) + J e,˜o

where (cid:126)vk,k(cid:48) = (k + k(cid:48)τ )(v,−v) gives the dependence of the corresponding integrands on the internal

partition function. At genus one, the total picture number of the vertex operators in the (e, ˜e) sector

must be (0, 0) [41], and as is customary we choose all of them in the (0, 0) picture. In shorthand notation

where, analogously as for the open-string integrand (3.33), we have expressed parts of the partition func-

its inclusion into the measure (3.59), and the vertex operators V (0,0)

(whose arguments zj are suppressed

j

for ease of notation) are deﬁned in (6.1).

Note that the contributions ¯ϑ˜ν(0, ¯τ ) and ¯S˜ν(¯γk,k(cid:48), ¯τ ) from the right-moving sector in (3.62) and (3.63)
are understood to be the complex conjugate of ϑ˜ν(0, τ ) and S˜ν(γk,k(cid:48), τ ), respectively. The same sort of

notation will appear in later equations on closed-string amplitudes, and will drop the obvious dependence

of the above functions on τ and ¯τ .

In the (e, ˜o) sector the super-moduli structure of the torus requires the total picture number of the

vertex operators to be (0,−1) and the inclusion of the picture changing operator P (0,+1). We have

exchange of left- and right-movers except for a uniform sign ± → + in both type IIA and type IIB. Note
that the spin sums in (3.62), (3.63) and (3.64) can be addressed through the methods of section 3.3.

4 Open-string scattering amplitudes

This section is devoted to the polarization-dependent part of open-string amplitudes (3.3) and (3.11) with

n = 3 and n = 4 external states and less-than-maximal supersymmetry. We evaluate the correlation
functions (cid:104)V (0)
n (cid:105)ν of vertex operators and exploit the simpliﬁcations due to the sum over
10This amplitude prescription is valid only for compactiﬁcations on T 6/ZN with N prime. Orbifold groups of non-prime
rank give rise to sectors with ﬁxed tori, leading to half-maximal contributions to (3.67) with two dimensional lattice sums

similar to (3.11). For ease of presentation, we do not contemplate this case.

parity-even spin structures along the lines of section 3.3. In contrast to [9, 10, 8], we do not make use of

four-dimensional spinor-helicity variables and mostly keep polarizations em and momenta km dimension-

agnostic. This is crucial for the infrared regularization scheme in section 4.2 and to simultaneously

address the D = 4 and D = 6 realizations of half-maximal supersymmetry. More generally, this

approach reveals parallels between various spacetime dimensions and varying amounts of supersymmetry,

culminating in the simple dictionary (4.43) between the parity-even contributions to amplitudes with

half-maximal and quarter-maximal supersymmetry.

4.1 Vertex operators and CFT basics

Gauge bosons as massless excitations of the open superstring are represented by vertex operators11

V (0)(e, k) ≡ em(∂X m + (k · ψ)ψm)ek·X

(4.1)

in the zero superghost picture. The BRST invariance of these vertex operators is ensured by having

lightlike momenta and transverse polarization vectors,

kmkm = 0 ,

kmem = 0 .

(4.2)

For the parity-odd sector (3.8) we also need the vertex in the −1 superghost picture as well as the
picture changing operator,

V (−1)(e, k) ≡ emψme−φek·X ,

P (+1) ≡ ∂Xmψmeφ ,

(4.3)

where the ﬁelds e±φ from bosonizing the β-γ superghost system [82, 83] only enter through their zero
modes in this work.

Correlation functions of the free conformal ﬁelds ∂X m(z) and ψm(z) of weight h = 1 and h = 1

2 are

determined by their two-point contractions on genus-one worldsheets,

(cid:104)∂X m(z)X n(0)(cid:105) = ηmnf (1)(z) ,

(cid:104)ψm(z)ψn(0)(cid:105)ν = ηmn

: ν = 2, 3, 4

: ν = 1

,

(4.4)

where f (1) and Sν are deﬁned in (3.16) and (3.14), respectively, and the modular parameter τ is sup-
pressed. The plane waves ek·X in the vertex operators yield the ubiquitous Koba–Nielsen factor,

11A note on conventions. To avoid proliferation of imaginary units, we absorb a factor of i in X m. In doing so we depart
from the standard form eik·X of the plane-wave part of the vertex operator. We also set α(cid:48) = 1/2 for open strings, and
for closed strings, α(cid:48) = 2.

4.2 Infrared regularization by minahaning

Any 3-point function of any massless external states naively vanishes by “3-point special kinematics”.

This means that all 3-point would-be Mandelstam invariants (4.8) vanish identically12, as implied by

become nonzero, but subject to the single condition

1 + km

2

(k1 + k2 + k3)2 = s12 + s23 + s13 = 0 .

(4.13)

This is needed to ensure that exponentials of boson propagators in the Koba–Nielsen factor (4.5) of

the string integrand are modular invariant. Other conditions on the deformed Mandelstam variables,

for example the more symmetric but stronger s12 = s23 = s13, would violate modular invariance, as
explained by Minahan in 1987 [44]. To see directly how the “deformation” momentum pm allows for

nonzero Mandelstam invariants in the 3-point function, take scalar products with for example k1:

k1 · p = k1 · (k1 + k2 + k3) = k1 · k2 + k1 · k3 = −s23 ,

(4.14)

i.e. the sij in the 3-point function are only nonzero due to the deformation pm. We give some more details

on this in appendix C. In general, we will refer to the procedure of relaxing momentum conservation

subject to the constraint(cid:80)n

i<j sij = 0 as “minahaning” an n-point function. For the 3-point amplitude
the need for some kind of infrared regularization is clear because of the infrared zero of 3-point special

kinematics, but we will argue that there is a sense in which this should be done for any n-point amplitude.

As a ﬁrst step in the subsequent calculations, we will combine the regularized (i.e. nonzero) Man-

delstam invariants as in (4.14) with vanishing propagator denominators from string theory such that all

indeterminate 0/0 expressions are taken care of. Then, for the purposes of this paper, we can safely set

the deformation pm to zero in our ﬁnal expressions for amplitudes.13

4.3 Half-maximal parity-even 3-point amplitude

For three external states, the well-known half-maximal integrand in (3.6) is given by

12 (e1 · e2)(e3 · Q3) + (3 ↔ 2, 1)(cid:1)

I e

(4.15)

13We note that the original procedure in [44] was a slightly stronger form of regularization, when terms in the eﬀective

action are computed without setting the deformation to zero at the end. This allows for the extraction of eﬀective couplings

from two-point functions, more recently used for example in [79] and references therein, which will not be discussed in

this work. To distinguish the stronger form of regularization from the weaker “minahaning” used in this paper, one might

be tempted to call the stronger procedure “maxahaning”. We will resist this temptation.

14 In addition to a power-series expansion in α(cid:48), loop-amplitudes in string theories give rise to logarithmic, non-analytic

momentum dependence. As will be elaborated in a companion paper [47], the integration region of large τ2 yields Feynman

integrals of Yang-Mills along with their threshold singularities in sij, see also [84, 85, 86, 87]. Following the discussion of

closed-string one-loop amplitudes in [88, 89, 90, 91], the analytic parts of the amplitude can be isolated in a well-deﬁned

manner.

All the spin sums are readily evaluated using (3.45) to (3.47) and give rise to functions f (1)f (1) or f (2)

with various combinations of arguments.

4.4.1 Double-pole treatment

Note that the spin sum G6 in the last line of (4.22) yields double poles in some of the zi − zj,

G6(γ,−γ, z12, z21, z34, z43) = F (2)

12 (e1 · e2)
and (e1 · Q1)(e2 · Q2) → (e1 · k2)f (1)
21 . These two sources of double poles conspire such as to
cancel the tensor structure (e1 · k2)(e2 · k1)t(3, 4) and to yield a double-pole residue ∼ (s12 − 1) along
with (e1 · e2)t(3, 4). The prefactor (s12 − 1) does the important job of eliminating tachyon propagation

and naturally combines with the maximally supersymmetric orbifold sector in (3.7).

4.4.2 Minahaning the 4-point function

(4.26)

(4.27)

The second class (ii) of functions ∼ f (2)

is non-singular as zi → zj and therefore does not contribute to
any factorization channel or the low-energy limit. However, the last two classes (iii) and (iv) of functions
yield up to two simultaneous kinematic poles from the integration region where zi → zj. Worse, the 3-

compensating numerator factors.

An analogous regulation procedure for divergent propagators ∼ s−1

123 was used for the 4-point 4-loop
amplitude of N = 4 super Yang–Mills (SYM) [92]. The kinematic numerators of so-called “snail graphs”

(see ﬁg. 3 in section II.D of the reference) are found to be proportional to k2

4 = 2s123 such as to cancel
the vanishing denominators (k1 + k2 + k3)2 from the external propagators. In the same way as these

ﬁnite contributions are essential for the 4-loop UV divergence of N = 4 SYM, our way of minahaning

the 4-point 1-loop amplitude for open strings will crucially impact its low-energy limit.

We will reorganize these in more compact and suggestive form in the following sections. Note that the

symmetries X12,3 + X23,1 + X31,2 = 0 and K123|4 + K231|4 + K312|4 = 0 are dual to each other and ensure
that the two terms X12,3K123|4 + X13,2K132|4 are permutation invariant in 1, 2, 3. The coeﬃcients Lij|kl
of the functions f (2)

ij have higher mass dimension than the K...|... and by (4.26) add up to

L12|34 + L13|24 + L14|23 = 2t8(1, 2, 3, 4) .

The low-energy limit associated with the ordering 1, 2, 3, 4 is obtained by setting

X12X34 → 1 ,
X12,3 → 1 ,

X41X23 → 1 ,
X13,2 → 0 ,

X13X24 → 0

(4.35)

along with cyclic permutations of (4.37). We then obtain the 4-point tree amplitude of Yang–Mills (YM)

which is obviously consistent with its 3-point analogue (4.20) under factorization, see appendix B.1 for

a factorization check beyond the low-energy limit.

4.4.3

Integration by parts

Apart from the fact that its integral is regular in 4-point kinematics s123 → 0, a key virtue of the
function X12,3 deﬁned in (4.30) is its suitability for integration by parts. By discarding a total derivative

31

of X12Π4 with respect to z3, we ﬁnd

0 = ∂3X12Π4 = X12(X31 + X32 + X34)Π4 ,

X12,3Π4 = X12X34Π4 .

(4.39)

Permutations of (4.39) as well as X12,3 + X23,1 + X31,2 = 0 allow us to express any integral in (4.31) with
two factors of f (1)

in terms of the two-element basis {X23,4, X24,3}:

(4.40)

Similarly to the maximally supersymmetric case [75], this amounts to eliminating all instances of z1
in the arguments of f (1)

ij . The tree amplitudes of SYM have been identiﬁed on the basis of (4.38),
and permutation invariance of the second line of (4.40) follows from the photon decoupling identity

Atree(1, 2, 3, 4) + Atree(1, 3, 4, 2) + Atree(1, 4, 2, 3) = 0. All the kinematic constituents Lij|kl, Atree(i, j, k, l)

and t8(1, 2, 3, 4) in the representation (4.40) of the correlator separately manifest gauge invariance.

4.4.4 Comparison with [8]

Even though our result in (4.40) is written in terms of the same basis function as the four-dimensional

expression in section 5.3 of [8], the kinematic coeﬃcients along with f (1)f (1) vanish in the computation

of the reference, regardless of the helicity conﬁguration. This causes a discrepancy with the non-zero

second line of our (4.40) which can be traced back to the minahaning procedure. In the present infrared

regularitzation scheme, intermediate kinematic factors proportional to s123 are kept in the spirit of
section 4.2 since they might later on cancel a divergent propagator (s123)−1 and contribute after integral
manipulations such as (4.29). In [8], on the other hand, spinor-helicity variables are introduced at an

early stage, which implicitly drops contributions proportional to s123 irrespective of the accompanying

worldsheet functions. It will be interesting to check whether infrared-safe observables in ﬁeld theory

computed from (4.40) and the analogous expression in [8] might match in spite of the above diﬀerences

in the string correlator.

Just like the result in [8], the D-dimensional expression (4.40) obeys the D = 4 corollary of super-

symmetric Ward identities that amplitudes with 3 or 4 particles of alike helicity vanish [93, 94]. All

the kinematic factors Lij|kl, Atree(i, j, k, l) and t8(1, 2, 3, 4) have been tested for this property after di-

mensional reduction to D = 4 and conversion to spinor-helicity variables. As will be demonstrated in a

companion paper [47], we are under the impression that the f (1)f (1) contributions in the second line of

(4.40) are important to identify the onset of UV-divergences of half-maximal SYM amplitudes in D = 4

dimensions.

32

4.5 Half-maximal parity-even amplitudes of higher multiplicity

Half-maximal amplitudes of higher multiplicity can be evaluated using the same principles. The required

spin sums for up to eight external states are available in (3.45) to (3.51) and can be easily extended

using the techniques of [78]. In the same way as the ﬁnal form (4.40) of the 4-point correlator aug-
ments the simplest function F (2)
1/2(γ) of the orbifold twist γ = kv with the maximally supersymmetric
kinematic factor t8(1, 2, 3, 4), the coeﬃcient of F (2)
1/2(γ) in higher-multiplicity amplitudes will reproduce
the maximally supersymmetric correlators in their dimensional reduction to D = 6. Starting from six
points, new combinations of the f (i) will emerge where the γ-dependence F (4)

4.6 Quarter-maximal generalizations in the parity-even sector

In the parity-even sector, the quarter-maximal counterparts of the above correlators I e
4,1/2
can be obtained from a minor modiﬁcation: according to the discussion of section 3.3, the net diﬀerence

3,1/2 and I e

between the quarter-maximal and half-maximal partition functions in (3.13) and (3.6) is captured by

the straightforward shift (3.58) in the functions of the orbifold twist. Explicitly, the modiﬁed spin

sums Gk(γ,−γ, . . .) → Gk+1(γ1, γ2, γ3, . . .) in (4.15) and (4.22) yield F (l)

4.7 Parity-odd integrands at lowest multiplicity

In the parity-odd sector, the zero-mode saturation rule (3.9) in D = 6 spacetime dimensions requires at

least three external legs in the prescription (3.8). After soaking up the ψm from the picture changing

operator and vertex operators – see (4.1) and (4.3) – the 3-point parity-odd integrand can be written as

tributions from the sum in (4.44) with j = 2, 3 drop out immediately, and momentum conservation
k1 = −k2 − k3 leads to the same conclusion for the term with j = 1. Hence, the dependence on the
position z0 of the picture changing operator via f (1)
is spurious, as expected from general arguments
0j
(cf. section 3.2.1).

This reasoning can be straightforwardly generalized to arbitrary even dimensions D: At the lowest

multiplicity D

kinematic argument above still makes the parity-odd correlator vanish,

As we will see, the ﬁrst truly non-zero parity-odd correlator I o

N,D for open strings occurs at multiplicity
2 + 1. Regardless of their multiplicity, parity-odd open-string amplitudes in D ≥ 4 dimensions do
not exhibit any factorization channel that requires minahaning. In their contribution to closed-string

amplitudes, however, parity-odd terms in D = 4 might introduce spurious divergent propagators.

4.8 Parity-odd integrands at next-to-lowest multiplicity

The simplest non-vanishing parity-odd contribution to half-maximal open-string amplitudes in D = 6

dimensions occurs at the 4-point level. A subtle chain of integral manipulations and kinematic rear-

rangements detailed in appendix D.1 conﬁrms independence on the position z0 of the picture changing

Note that (4.48) and its generalizations to higher multiplicity vanish for external gauge bosons upon

dimensional reduction to D < 6. That is why parity-odd contributions are excluded for amplitudes
(3.10) in K3 × T 2 compactiﬁcations.

Upon combination with the parity-even counterpart (4.40), the kinematic coeﬃcients of f (2)

E1|23,4 → 2is23(k2, e2, k3, e3, k4, e4) and thereby signals a gauge anomaly of the form F ∧ F ∧ F . The

5 Berends–Giele organization of open-string amplitudes

In this section, the kinematic organizing principles of the above open-string results are explored. They

rely on bosonic Berends–Giele currents em

12...p which recursively resum Feynman diagrams with p external
on-shell states and an additional oﬀ-shell leg. While Berends–Giele currents were ﬁrst used in the 1980’s

to elegantly address gluonic tree amplitudes [95] in YM theories, the value of this concept for superstring

theories became apparent in [96, 27, 28].

In these references, tree-level amplitudes for any number

of massless open superstring states were computed in the pure spinor formalism [3]. The underlying

supersymmetric Berends–Giele currents have been generalized and streamlined in [75, 97, 98], connected

35

with the component currents from the 80’s in [98, 99] and exploited to compute and compactly represent

loop amplitudes of the pure spinor superstring in [75, 91, 2, 69, 11].

The Berends–Giele representation of maximally supersymmetric string amplitudes led to a variety of

insights on ten-dimensional SYM amplitudes in pure spinor superspace. In addition to the ﬁeld-theory
limit α(cid:48)
→ 0 of superstring amplitudes, ten-dimensional SYM amplitudes have been obtained from ﬁrst
principles – locality and BRST invariance. Locality amounts to imposing the Feynman-diagram content

in the Berends–Giele constituents of the desired amplitude, and BRST invariance powerfully embodies

both maximal supersymmetry and gauge-invariance of bosonic components [3]. This program has been

successfully applied at tree level [100, 101], one loop [102, 103] and two loops [104].

It will now be demonstrated that the Berends–Giele approach to string amplitudes can be extended

to half- and quarter maximal supersymmetry. The structure of the above half-maximal 3- and 4-point

amplitudes will be clariﬁed using the bosonic components of supersymmetric Berends–Giele currents

[95, 98, 99]. Apart from the conceptual beneﬁt of extending the pure spinor methods, this will pave

the way for a compact and enlightening representation of the closed-string computations in section

6. Moreover, a ﬁrst-principles approach to half-maximal SYM one-loop amplitudes obtained in the

ﬁeld-theory limit will be discussed in a companion paper [47].

5.1 Deﬁnition of bosonic Berends–Giele currents

We will only deﬁne the minimal set of Berends–Giele currents which ﬁnds appearance in half-maximal

amplitudes with no more than four external legs16. Bosonic currents with a maximum of three on-shell

legs are deﬁned recursively via [95, 98, 99]

5.2 Scalar building blocks for half-maximal loop amplitudes

on-shell legs, we deﬁne the fundamental scalar building block

(5.4)

such that for instance M1,2 = (k1·e2)(k2·e1)−s12(e1·e2) = t(1, 2). Following the minahaning prescription
in section 4.2, one can straightforwardly check that

M12,3 = (e1 · e2)(k1 · e3) = s−1

12 K12|3

M123,4 = K123|4 ,

M12,34 = K12|34

(5.6)

reproduce the kinematic dependence of the half- and quarter-maximal open-string correlators, see

(4.32) and (4.33) for the 4-point expressions. Note that (5.5) and (5.6) only hold in massless 3-

particle and 4-particle momentum phase space, respectively. It is striking to see the kinematic factors

K12|3, K123|4, K12|34 decompose into two Berends–Giele currents once the the dust of their string-theory

origin (including the spin sums in section 3.3 and the integral manipulations (4.25) and (4.29)) has set-

tled. This shows the value of the integral processing in section 4.4: it incorporates ﬁeld-theory insights

into the organization of string amplitudes.

The emergence of tree amplitudes Atree(. . .) in half-maximal open-string amplitudes yields a repre-

sentation in terms of the scalar building block (5.4),

equations, the expressions in (5.7) and (5.8) can be generated from the Lagrangian ∼ F mnFmn, evaluated
on this perturbative solution [106, 98, 99]. Note that the scalar building block in (5.4) is reminiscient

of the maximally supersymmetric one-loop building blocks deﬁned in section 5.2 of [97] (see [75] for

pioneering work) which were later identiﬁed as local box numerators in ten-dimensional SYM [103].

5.3 Vector & tensor building blocks for half-maximal loop amplitudes

While the scalar building block in (5.4) completely captures the kinematic coeﬃcient of f (1) in half-
maximal open-string amplitudes at multiplicity n ≤ 4, the f (2) terms as well as the closed string will
require various extensions. We will design vectorial and tensorial building blocks such that parity-

even and parity-odd contributions to half-maximal string integrands are uniﬁed. For this purpose, the

following basic building block for parity-odd kinematics is introduced,

where the vertical-bar notation A|B, C is a reminder of the special role of the ﬁrst slot, E m
and E m
occurring composition of parity-even and parity-odd kinematics,

A|B,C (cid:54)= E m

where only the parity-even constituents are permutation invariant in A, B, C. This deﬁnition is remini-

scient of the maximally supersymmetric vector building blocks deﬁned in section 5.4 of [97], see [91, 11]

and [103] for their role in closed-string amplitudes and pentagon numerators in SYM amplitudes, re-

spectively.

In the same way as the maximally supersymmetric vectors were recursively extended to tensors of

arbitrary rank [102], we deﬁne a two-tensor counterpart to the bosonic vector in (5.10):

A|B,C,D ≡ 2(cid:2)e(m

(5.11)

It will play an essential role for the closed-string 4-point function in section 6.4 and the loop-momentum

dependent part of Feynman-diagram numerators in the ﬁeld-theory limit [47].

38

Note that the combination of parity-even and parity-odd parts in (5.10) and (5.11) are tailor-made

for half-maximal supersymmetry in D = 6. By the universality result (4.43), the dimensional reduction

of MA,B, M m

A|B,C) also appears in
quarter-maximal amplitudes. However, the parity-odd contributions in quarter-maximal settings follow

A|B,C,D to D = 4 (suppressing parity-odd contributions ∼ E m

A|B,C and M mn

diﬀerent patterns as compared to the half-maximal case, see the discussion in sections 4.7 and 4.8.

5.4 Gauge-(pseudo-)invariant kinematic factors

Gauge transformations of the above building blocks yield a rewarding web of relations involving lower-

multiplicity counterparts. These gauge variations resemble the BRST variations in pure spinor super-

space [97, 102] and will be thoroughly discussion in the companion paper [47]. For our present purposes,

we simply state the gauge invariant combinations of the scalar, vectorial and tensorial building blocks

(5.4), (5.10) and (5.11) which will ﬁnd prominent appearance in half-maximal amplitudes of the open

and closed string.

Since any Berends–Giele current em

C1|234 ≡ M1,234 + M123,4 + M412,3 + M341,2 + M12,34 + M41,23

(5.13)

(5.14)

(5.15)

are invariant under linearized gauge transformation of any external leg in the appropriate momentum

phase space. Note that the expansions in terms of M... and M m

1|2,3,4,5 and C m

... closely resemble the maximally super-

1|23,4,5,6 deﬁned in section 5 of [97].

The situation for tensors is slightly diﬀerent since their trace carries the ﬁngerprints of the gauge

Again, the construction of the 4-point kinematic factors (5.16) and (5.18) is inspired by six-point counter-

parts in the maximally supersymmetric case. More speciﬁcally, the associated expressions for C mn

and P1|2|3,4,5,6 in pure spinor superspace are given in (3.14) and (5.22) of [102].

5.5 Rewriting the open-string correlator

In terms of the above pseudo-invariants, the parity-even and parity-odd parts of the 3- and 4-point

The parity-even parts of the pseudo-invariants P1|2|3,4 and P1|(23)|4 in (5.18) and (5.22) reproduce the
gauge invariant quantities Lij|pq deﬁned in (4.34),

Note that the structure of the half-maximal 4-point correlator (5.21) closely resembles the maximally

supersymmetric six-point correlator in section 3 of [11]. Moreover, the expansion of C1|234, P1|2|3,4
and P1|(23)|4 in terms of Berends–Giele building blocks mirrors their higher-multiplicity counterparts
C1|234,5,6, P1|2|3,4,5,6 and P1|(23)|4,5,6 in pure spinor superspace [11].

The virtue of organizing the kinematic factors of half-maximal string amplitudes in terms of the

building blocks MA,B and their tensorial generalizations will become particularly obvious from the

closed-string amplitudes discussed in the following section.

In this section, we evaluate and simplify half-maximal 3-point and 4-point closed-string amplitudes

involving gravitons, B-ﬁelds and dilatons in D = 6 dimensions. Similar to the integration-by-parts

reduction of the open-string correlators, we will cast the worldsheet functions from the closed-string

prescription into an integral basis. The accompanying kinematic factors then manifest gauge invariance

or pseudo-invariance, see subsection 5.4. The simpliﬁed expressions for the amplitudes are suitable to

extract 4-point couplings in the type II eﬀective action and to appreciate the structural similarity to the

maximally supersymmetric 6-point amplitude of [11]. We will give some parity-even examples of novel

eﬀective couplings and check some known results, but we will not address ﬁeld redeﬁnitions, rescalings

or frame-changing (see section 2.2). Our focus here is the string amplitudes, and we leave a detailed

study of the loop-corrected string eﬀective action to the future.

6.1 Vertex operators and left-right interactions

Massless NSNS-excitations of the closed superstring are represented by vertex operators

V (0,0)(e, ˜e, k) ≡ em(∂X m + (k · ψ)ψm) ˜en( ¯∂X n + (k · ˜ψ) ˜ψn) ek·X
V (0,−1)(e, ˜e, k) ≡ em(∂X m + (k · ψ)ψm) ˜en
V (−1,−1)(e, ˜e, k) ≡ emψme−φ ˜en
˜ψne− ˜φ ek·X .

¯ψne− ˜φ ek·X

(6.1)

(6.2)

(6.3)

Apart from the exponentials, they are double-copies of the open-string vertex operators V (0), V (−1), and
the tensor product of polarization vectors em ⊗ ˜en comprises gravitons, B-ﬁelds and a dilaton. The
fermions ψm, ˜ψn do not interact and yield the holomorphic and antiholomorphic correlation functions,

respectively, from the open-string sectors. Accordingly, the spin sums can be carried out separately for

left- and right-movers using the techniques of section 3.3. The bosons, on the other hand, entangle left-

and right-movers through an additional zero-mode contraction,

(cid:104)∂X m(z) ¯∂X n(0)(cid:105) = ηmnπ

,

(6.4)

(cid:17)
(cid:16) 1
Im (τ ) − δ2(z, ¯z)

where the delta-function on the right-hand side does not contribute in the presence of the Koba–Nielsen

factor Πn in (4.5) and will therefore be suppressed17. Note that the closed-string picture changing

operators in (3.64) and (3.65) are double-copies of the open-string counterparts in (4.3), i.e.

P (0,+1) ≡ ¯∂Xm

˜ψme ˜φ ,

P (+1,+1) ≡ ∂Xmψmeφ ¯∂Xn

˜ψne ˜φ .

(6.5)

17Note that with our convention of absorbing a factor i in X (see footnote 11 in section 4.1) the delta function has a

negative coeﬃcient, the opposite of textbook conventions like [41].

Integration by parts relations introduce additional interactions18 between left- and right movers since

the worldsheet functions deﬁned by (3.15) are no longer holomorphic at non-zero genus [78],

By (6.4) and (6.6), n-point closed-string correlators receive additional terms ∼

illustrate both sources of corrections through 3-point and 4-point examples.

6.1.1 Zero mode contractions between ∂X and ¯∂X

The contribution of the zero-mode contractions (6.4) to closed-string correlators can be studied in-

dependently in the left- and right-moving sector. The key information stems from summing over all

possibilities to isolate k zero-modes ∂X m from open-string quantities V (0) or P (+1). The subsequent

6.2 Low-energy prescriptions
To study the implications of closed-string amplitudes for the low-energy eﬀective action, the α(cid:48)
→ 0
behavior of the worldsheet integrals has to be extracted. Since a discussion of the Feynman diagrams

in the supergravity limit along the lines of [1] is relegated to the companion paper [47], we will follow

the procedure of [88, 89, 90, 91] to truncate the integrals to their analytic momentum-dependence.

The leading low-energy behavior of closed-string integrals is determined by the piece with the high-

est number of kinematic poles. They originate from a “diagonal” pair of worldsheet singularities
−2 where the left-and right moving arguments match, following the general pole

f (1)(z) ¯f (1)(¯z) ∼ |z|

prescription

(cid:90)

d2z |z|s−2g(z) =

π
s

g(0) + O(s0)

(6.19)

for functions g(z) that are regular at the origin. By repeated use of (6.19), only diagonal combinations
of Xij and ¯Xkl aﬀect the low-energy limit, e.g.

X12
¯X12

¯X12 → s12 + O(s2
ij) ,
¯X34 → s12s34 + O(s3

¯X13

¯X13 → O(s2

¯X24 → O(s3

ij) ,

X12X34

(6.20)

where the ’→’-notation is understood to only keep track of the leading order of α(cid:48) occurring in the

amplitude under discussion.

For the nested product Xij,k deﬁned in (4.30), the analogous rules are determined by

X12,3

¯X12,3 → s12(s13 + s23) + O(s3

ij) ,

X12,3

¯X23,1 → −s12s23 + O(s3

ij) ,

(6.21)

whereas diﬀerent triplets of arguments do not yield any low-energy contribution at leading order, e.g.

X12,3

¯X12,4 → O(s3

ij) , X12,3

¯X23,4 → O(s3

(6.23)

These schematic rules will be used in the following to extract matrix elements of the R2 interaction

from the low-energy limit of 3-point and 4-point closed-string amplitudes. Note that integrals involving
non-singular worldsheet functions f (2)

1/2 on either the left-moving or the right-moving side do

ij and F (2)
not contribute to the 4-point low-energy limit.

44

Subleading terms in the analytic low-energy expansions exhibit a gap at the mass dimension of R3

such that the ﬁrst non-vanishing interaction beyond the low-energy limit occurs at the order of R4. This
follows from the low-energy behavior of torus integrals over zj in presence of f (1) ¯f (1) [90, 91] where any
tentative contribution at subleading order in α(cid:48) is found to integrate to zero. The results of [91] for 5-
and 6-point integrals in the maximally supersymmetric case directly carry over to the subsequent 3- and

4-point integrals in the half-maximal case.

6.3 Half-maximal 3-point amplitude

The treatment of left-right interactions outlined in section 6.1 is easily applied to the 3-point amplitude.

The calculation can be found in the literature (see [48] and references therein), and we recalculate it

using our methods and the notation of the previous sections to prepare for the 4-point generalization.

With the open-string kinematic factors in (4.19) and (4.44) as well as the chiral halves (6.10) and (6.11)

of left-right contractions, the half-maximal closed-string correlator is given by

expansions of X12

1|2,3 = 0 or sij = 0 and manifests the structural similarity with the maximally supersymmetric

5-point amplitude in section 4.1 of [11].

In absence of worldsheet singularities, the Koba–Nielsen factor along with (6.27) can be replaced by

its Taylor-expansion which trivializes to Π3 = 1 by 3-particle kinematics. Hence, the low-energy limit

components will be discussed further in section 6.5. We remind the reader that we will not perform any

integrals over the worldsheet modulus τ in this paper. It is of course important to do so to extract the

moduli-dependence of the string eﬀective action, and we would like to return to this issue in the future.
The slightly abusive notation MR2(1, 2, . . . , n) for the low-energy limit refers to matrix elements
involving any combination of n NSNS sector states at the same order in α(cid:48) as the gravitational R2
correction. The n-graviton component due to the R2 interaction can be straightforwardly extracted by

setting ˜em

Note that the last line of (6.31) will conspire with left-right interacting integrations by part and eventually

contribute to the ﬁrst three terms of the pseudo-invariant P1|2|3,4 in (5.18).

Note that the bilinears in pseudo-invariants seen in (6.32) mimic the patterns in the maximally super-

symmetric 6-point amplitude at lower-multiplicity, see section 4.2 of [11].

The anomalous gauge variations along with factors of f (2)

in the ﬁrst two lines of (6.32) conspire

to total derivatives in τ and the zj. This follows from the same arguments as given for the maximally

supersymmetric 6-point torus amplitude discussed in section 4.4 of [11].

The low-energy limit of (6.32) can be easily performed by means of the rules in section 6.2 and takes

discussed in [9, 10]. That discussion was specialized early on to the ﬁeld-theory limit and spinor-helicity

expressions. After the manipulations performed here, we believe the present string amplitude clearly

exhibits several interesting features that were not manifest in [9, 10]. Apart from its applicability
to arbitrary dimensions D ≤ 6, one important aspect is the presence and limitations of double-copy
structure in this string amplitude. More precisely, the P ˜P structure in the last line of (6.32) obstructs
Im τ )2. We expect this
to be the source of the tension between worldsheet correlators and double copies of gauge-theory BCJ

the naive expectation to ﬁnd a pure tensor contraction Tmn

˜T mn along with ( π

numerators observed in [10]. We hope to say more about the implications of (6.32) for the BCJ-duality

between color and kinematics in the future.

6.5 The low-energy limit in type IIB and type IIA

This section is devoted to the type IIB and IIA components of the low-energy limits MR2(1, 2, . . . , n)
in (6.28) and (6.34). The 3-point case has already been investigated in [48] where the parity-even IIB

components were found to vanish for any combination of gravitons, B-ﬁelds and dilatons. The IIB

cancellation relies on the interplay between the even/even and odd/odd spin structures and does not

occur for type IIA because of the diﬀerent GSO projections [48]:

Note that the parity-even type IIA result in (6.37) vanishes for an odd number of B-ﬁelds.

6.5.1 Comparison with the heterotic string

Matrix elements of the R2 interaction also appear in tree-level amplitudes of the heterotic string [20]
and the bosonic string [24] upon expanding to the linear order in α(cid:48). This yields a KLT-like double copy
of YM amplitudes and F 3 matrix elements known from the (α(cid:48))1-order of the bosonic open string [23],

which also matches the bosonic-string result. The F 3-constituents are given by [40]

where the right hand side of (6.43) manifests gauge-invariance at the expense of manifest locality. Note
that the structure of AF 3(1, 2, 3, 4) = s13 × {totally symmetric quantity} guarantees that the BCJ-
relations of Atree(. . .) [105] are also obeyed by AF 3(. . .) [23] and that (6.41) is permutation invariant.

This discussion connects to that about ﬁeld redeﬁnitions in section 2.2: in D = 4, any tensor structure

for the R2 interaction is on-shell equivalent to the Gauss-Bonnet combination, that is topological if there

is no moduli-dependent coeﬃcient, cf. (2.6). The on-shell vanishing of (6.40) and (6.41) in D = 4 can be
seen from the fact that there is no combination of graviton helicities where both Atree(. . .) and AF 3(. . .)

are non-zero [23].

The 3-graviton component agrees between the type IIA 1-loop low-energy limit (6.37), (6.39) and

the heterotic tree-level coupling (6.40),

B-ﬁelds and dilatons, however, give rise to diﬀerent component amplitudes. This is expected since the
left-right contractions of the form (ei · ˜ej) are absent at tree-level.

6.5.2 The 4-point low-energy limit

While parity-even type IIB couplings vanish for any triplet of NSNS sector states, see (6.37), non-zero

results appear at the 4-point level: For type IIB gravitons and dilatons with em

j = ˜em

j , we have

In presence of B-ﬁelds, to be denoted by 1B, 2B, . . . in the following, the non-vanishing amplitudes are

6.6 Quarter-maximal closed-string amplitudes

The universality results on the parity-even part of quarter- and half-maximal open-string amplitudes

in section 4.6 can be extended to the closed string. The additional left-right contractions (6.4) do not

alter the key observation (3.58) about the sum over even spin structures in the left- and right-moving

50

sector: Half-maximal and quarter-maximal cases only diﬀer in the functions F (k)
of orbifold twists γk,k(cid:48) ≡ (k + k(cid:48)τ )v and γj

k,k(cid:48))
k,k(cid:48) ≡ (k + k(cid:48)τ )vj. Hence, the parity-even/even parts of n-point

1/2(γk,k(cid:48)) and F (k+1)

(6.53)

In presence of parity-odd admixtures from either left- or right-movers, the universality breaks down

by the discussion in section 4.8. From (4.51), for instance, parity-odd/odd contributions to quarter-
maximal 3-point amplitudes involve worldsheet functions of the type f (2)

These structural diﬀerences in parity-odd contributions to half-maximal and quarter-maximal ampli-
tudes also aﬀect the low-energy behavior. For example, up to n−1 left-right contractions are compatible
with the four-dimensional version of the n-point parity-odd/odd prescription (3.65), leading to tensorial

We see that just as for half-maximal above, the parity-even sector of the low-energy limit of the closed-

string 4-point function on Calabi-Yau orbifolds has the mass dimension of R2, so it does not produce

a loop correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action, as expected from general arguments, see section 2.3.

Only the parity odd/odd part of Calabi-Yau amplitudes has the right mass dimension to produce a loop

correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action. However, this is delicate to see since it might require further

minahaning; in the calculations above, we used strict momentum conservation in the odd/odd sector.

7 Conclusions and outlook

We made progress on calculating one-loop string amplitudes with reduced supersymmetry through three

key methods:

• Modular functions f (n) that let us generalize spin sums from the maximally supersymmetric case
• the minahaning procedure of relaxing momentum conservation as infrared regularization
• building blocks of Berends–Giele type to capture gauge (pseudo-)invariant kinematic factors

A companion paper [47] on the ﬁeld-theory limit will elaborate on the value of the Berends–Giele

organization of kinematic factors for 1-loop amplitudes of half-maximal SYM in six and lower dimensions.

Another domain of application of the current results that we have not pursued in detail is the string

eﬀective action. To make this explicit we should perform integrals over the worldsheet modulus τ . We

51

have set the stage for a systematic α(cid:48)-expansion by expressing integrands in terms of useful modular
objects, but we did not discuss their integration over τ here19.

One issue with this is that we have not been too speciﬁc about string theory models; for the open

string models, we should include orientifolds for tadpole cancellation. As in for example [7], we believe

that this can be done straightforwardly from our results.

We have not touched on RR ﬁelds at all in this paper. One interesting class of calculations concerns

the completion of the dilaton and the NSNS ﬁeld strength H3 to the NSNS+RR axio-dilaton and self-

dual ﬁeld strength G3. As an example, the action at order α(cid:48)3 contains for example |G3|2R3 (see e.g.

[110, 111, 112] as well as [91] for S-duality properties of higher-derivative corrections).

As emphasized earlier, it is important to remember that these calculations are performed at the

orbifold point, and generalizations to smooth Calabi-Yau manifolds (including smooth K3) with the

same amount of supersymmetry may vary from straightforward to highly nontrivial [113]. Whether or

not these results are representative of generic points in moduli space, experience shows that explicit

results at speciﬁc points will provide useful and highly needed guidance for generalizations [114].

It would be very interesting to revisit our amplitudes in a manifestly supersymmetric formalism –

either by using the hybrid formalism [115, 116] or by deforming the pure spinor formalism [3] to preserve

half-maximal supersymmetry in D = 6 dimensions.

vertex operator insertions zi at a given order, see [78] for its application in the maximally supersymmetric case. In the

closed-string sector, torus integrals over zi can be universally addressed using the techniques of [89, 108, 37, 109], see in

particular [90, 91] for connections between amplitudes of diﬀerent multiplicities.

A Orbifold Partition Functions

In this appendix, we give further details on the vacuum amplitudes associated with the prescriptions in

section 3. In compactiﬁcations of type I to D dimensions on orbifold limits of Calabi-Yau threefolds or

K3, the cylinder vacuum amplitude (partition function) for open strings stretching between D9-branes

can be written as 20 [117]

In the main text we discuss gauge boson and graviton amplitudes for various orbifold compactiﬁcations,
namely for R1,5× T 4/ZN , R1,3× T 6/ZN and R1,3× T 2× T 4/ZN . To write general expressions that cover
all these cases and to account for the possible presence of half-maximal sub-sectors in D = 4, which

depends on the rank N , we introduce the following slightly non-standard notation: by dk we denote

the number of internal dimensions where for the given k the orbifold has a ﬁxed direction, and we set

Dk = D + dk. For orbifold compactiﬁcations preserving some supersymmetry, which we always assume,
the open string partition function integrands can be expressed as 21

In section, we verify that the representation of the 4-point open string correlator in (4.31) factorizes

correctly upon integration. We have to show that the residue of the kinematic pole in s12 can be written

in terms of the 3-point integrand (4.19) with a cubic vertex of SYM attached. This cubic vertex can be

represented using the two-particle polarization vector

for a 3-point K3 amplitude involving either (e12, e3, e4) or (e1, e2, e34) both of which are only deﬁned up

to s12 = s34. The statement to prove is

(B.2)

where the right hand side is deﬁned modulo s12 by modiﬁcations of the integrand (4.19) such as

I3,1/2(12, 3, 4) ≡ X1+2,3(e12 · e3)(e4 · k12) + X3,4(e3 · e4)(e12 · k3) + X4,1+2(e4 · e12)(e3 · k4) ,

(B.3)

using the vanishing of parity-odd contributions (4.44). The notation (12, 3, 4) instructs to evaluate the

3-point integrand at polarizations e12, e3, e4, momenta k12, k3, k4 and coinciding positions z1 = z2, e.g.

(cid:12)(cid:12)z1=z2

(cid:12)(cid:12)z1=z2

X1+2,3 ≡ X13 + X23

= (s13 + s23)f (1)
23

.

(B.4)

The residue of the 4-point amplitude in s12 = s34 required by (B.2) is unaﬀected by the parity-odd part in
(4.48) since the integrals involving f (2)

ij are local. The only kinematic poles in the parity-even integrand
(4.31) stem from K123|4, K124|3, K341|2, K342|1 and K12|34, see (4.32) and (4.33). The accompanying
worldsheet functions must be mapped to their s12 → 0 regime,

X12 = δ(z1 − z2) + O(s12) ,

X34 = δ(z3 − z4) + O(s34) ,

which only holds after integration against Π4. In this limit,

C Kinematics of massless 3-point functions

In this appendix we give a few reminders about basic on-shell kinematics and connect the discussion

with an interpretation of the minahaning procedure in section 4.2.

C.1 Scalar 3-particle special kinematics

Massless 3-point functions of scalars vanish on-shell with momentum conservation by kinematics. Here

a quick reminder why this is. Momentum conservation with all momenta ingoing is

k1 + k2 + k3 = 0 .

(C.1)

Take the scalar product of this with k1 and use on-shell masslessness k2

1 = 0 to obtain k1 · k2 = −k1 · k3.

But this leads to

(cid:125)
0 = (k1 + k2 + k3)2 = 2k1 · k2 + 2k1 · k3

(cid:123)(cid:122)

(cid:124)

=0

+2k2 · k3 = 2k2 · k3

(C.2)

so k2 · k3 = 0, and similarly for the remaining two Mandelstam variables. We see that all Lorentz scalars
k2
i = ki · kj = 0, using momentum conservation and on-shell-ness.

56

C.2 Vector 3-particle special kinematics

“Vectors” here mainly refer to non-Abelian gauge bosons. With vector polarizations ei we can make
nonzero Lorentz scalars. A priori there are 6 independent ei · kj for each i (cid:54)= j, but

e1 · (k1 + k2 + k3) = 0

(C.3)

so by transversality ei · ki = 0 (no sum), we have e1 · (k2 + k3) = 0 and cyclic. In other words, the only
nonzero scalars are polarizations contracted with momentum diﬀerences ki − kj, which leaves three:

e1 · (k2 − k3) ,

e2 · (k3 − k1) ,

e3 · (k1 − k2)

(C.4)

This is enough to write the tree-level 3-point amplitude. However, at least in D = 4, even these three

Lorentz scalars vanish due to 3-particle special kinematics. One way to think about this is that the
momenta need to be collinear, so one can always reduce any ei · kj to ei · ki = 0.

C.3

Interpretation of the minahaning procedure

problem: just go oﬀ-shell, k2

In quantum ﬁeld theory, the fact that 3-point amplitudes of massless particles vanish on-shell is no
i (cid:54)= 0. In the amplitude literature [34], one routinely uses 3-point functions
as building blocks, but with complex momenta. In (ﬁrst-quantized) string theory our options are more

limited. As detailed in section 4.2, we use the minahaning procedure: we keep real momenta but relax

momentum conservation, and maintain on-shell conditions k2

i = 0. Then we have three Lorentz scalars
in the 3-point function, at least as an intermediate step. The basic idea is that the physical state

conditions are not violated by relaxing momentum conservation.

But what does it mean to relax momentum conservation? One operational way to think of it is

that the 3-point function is “embedded” in the 4-point function (so the 4th momentum supplies the

deformation), and the 4-point in the 5-point (as embodied in the notation s123 for the deformation), and

so on. This sounds self-consistent but surprising. A more physical way to relax momentum conservation

is to use an external background ﬁeld, for example a gravitational background, such as AdS or a sphere

[59].22

In an orbifold, there is delta-function curvature at the ﬁxed points, so the orbifold twist γ

insertion mimics a background gravitation ﬁeld insertion, as in ﬁg. 7. However, we emphasize that this

is diﬀerent from the insertion of an ordinary vertex operator, since the “position” of this insertion is

the twist γ, which is not integrated over. It does capture the idea that with a background ﬁeld, there is

potentially a background insertion in every n-point function.

22Of course, backgrounds such as spheres may not be suitable as regulators if they break supersymmetry [42].

57

Figure 7: A schematic picture of minahaning as background ﬁeld insertion.

For completeness, we also mention that Dp-branes for p < 9 provide another setting where momentum

conservation in the naive sense is “naturally relaxed”: momentum is not conserved transverse to the

D-brane, since the D-brane is very massive in perturbation theory (see for example [45]).

D Parity-odd contributions

D.1 Parity-odd scalar correlator in arbitrary dimensions

As argued in sections 4.7 and 4.8, parity-odd contributions to open-string one-loop amplitudes in D
spacetime dimensions kick in at multiplicity N ≡ D
2 + 1. Following the ten-dimension six-point analysis
in appendix B.2 of [11], we shall sketch intermediate steps towards the dimension-agnostic expression
for I o

N,D in (4.51).
Using momentum conservation as well as overantisymmetrizations over D + 1 indices such as

12 conspires to the expression (4.52) for E12|3,4,...,N ,

E12|3,4,...,N = −E1|23,4,...,N − E1|24,3,5,...,N − . . . − E1|2N,3,4,...,N−1 .

(D.7)

In view of (D.7), the expressions for the parity-odd correlator in (D.6) and (4.51) are identical.

D.2 The parity-odd 4-point vector correlator

In this appendix, we display intermediate expressions leading to the compact result (6.15) for the
parity-odd 4-point vector correlator I m,o
4,D=6. After peeling of a zero mode of ∂X m, one OPE among
the conformal ﬁelds is compatible with the parity-odd zero-mode saturation (3.9). Contractions of the

picture changing operator at z0 (as indicated by(cid:12)(cid:12)f (1)
