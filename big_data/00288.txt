Abstract. A phase transition model for porous media in consolidation is studied. The
model is able to describe the phenomenon of ﬂuid–segregation during the consolida-
tion process, i.e., the coexistence of two phases diﬀering from ﬂuid content inside the
porous medium under static load. Considering pure Darcy dissipation, the dynamics is
described by a Cahn–Hilliard–like system of partial diﬀerential equations (PDE). The
goal, here, is to study the dynamics of the formation of stationary ﬂuid–rich bubbles.
The evolution of the strain and ﬂuid density proﬁles of the porous medium is analyzed
in two physical situation: ﬂuid free to ﬂow through the boundaries of the medium and
ﬂuid ﬂow prevented at one of the two boundaries. Morover, an analytic result on the
position of the interface between the two phases is provided.

1. Introduction

In the context of soil consolidation, one can consider the problem of ﬂuid–segregation.
Terzaghi’s and Biot’s theories [21] and [3, 4] admit only one sationary state. On the
other hand the so–called Mandel–Cryer eﬀect, see [17] and [13], is capable to predict
ﬂuid–segregation for special geometries of the porous material and for short–time only.
In the recent literature an extension of the classical Biot theory has been formulated
via a nonlinear poromechanical model within the framework of second gradient theories
[7–9, 11]. This model is able to describe the occurrence of a second stationary state
richer in ﬂuid. Thus, ﬂuid–segregation is described by considering a kind of phase
transition.

The model in [7–9, 11] is based on the introduction of a quartic energy potential,
depending on the strain ε and the variation of the ﬂuid mass density m. This potential
is an extension to that of Biot [3] and, beside the new ﬂuid–rich phase, it provides the
same Biot’s standard phase. The dissipation process which characterizes the dynamics
of consolidation is described considering a pure Darcy dissipation rather than a pure
Stokes dissipation. It is possible to prove that Darcy dissipation implies the behavior of
the porous system to be governed by a kind of Cahn–Hilliard set of partial diﬀerential
equations (PDE), whilst pure Stokes dissipation yields a kind of Allen–Cahn set of
equations [11]. The eﬀect of the external world on the consolidating porous medium
can be coded into the boundary conditions of the PDE problem describing the evolution
of the system. The main mathematical diﬀerence between the two PDE cases is that
the Allen–Cahn–like equation is a second–order PDE, while the Cahn–Hilliard equation
a fourth–order one. Thus, in the latter case two additional boundary conditions have
to be prescribed.

Here we describe the eﬀects of an impermeable wall on the consolidation process.
The main appropriate equation in this context is the Cahn–Hilliard one; in fact in this
case we can prescribe boundary conditions on the chemical–potential or on its derivative

(seepage velocity), while in the Allen–Cahn case, being this choice impossible, the
chemical potential is ﬁxed to be zero in the boundaries, thus letting the ﬂuid be free
to ﬂow.

In [1], as an extension to the model [7–9,11], the authors introduced an impermeable
wall in one of the boundaries; in order to obtain the ﬂuid–segregation inside the porous
medium, the ﬂuid–poor and the ﬂuid–rich phases at the boundaries of the medium
itself were prescribed thanks to Dirichlet boundary conditions. The numerical analysis
performed there allowed to learn how the segregation occurs:
independently of the
presence of the wall, the dynamics is divided in two steps, the formation of the interfaces
and the motion towards the stationary proﬁle.

Once the ﬂuid–segregation dynamics is obtained by a prescription of the boundary
values, a set of more realistic boundary conditions has to be taken into account. In
the present work we discuss the eﬀects of the impermeable wall by choosing a set of
Neumann homogenous boundary conditions. We ﬁnd that in the case of impermeable
wall the dynamics ends with the formation of an interface between the ﬂuid–poor
and the ﬂuid–rich phases, while the dynamics without the wall reaches the standard
Biot phase. Regarding the study of the stationary problem, we are able to prove
analytically that the position of the interface in this case of Neumann homegenous
boundary conditions is the same of the Dirichlet case, a result ﬁrstly discussed in
[10]. For a detailed discussion regarding the more natural situation described by these
boundary conditions we remand to Subsection 2.4.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we resume the model of [7–9, 11]
and we discuss the physical meaning of the boundary conditions under consideration.
In Section 3 we discuss numerical simulations of the stationary problem and we prove
an analytic result regarding the position of the interface between the two phases. In
Section 4 we discuss the dynamical problem, pointing out the role of the impermeable
wall in one of the boundaries of the porous material. Finally, in Section 5 we resume
the main results of this work.

2. The model

In this Section we resume the model of [7–9, 11] with the extension made in [1].
Morover we present a discussion on the meaning of the boundary conditions taken into
account and we apply the model to a special choice of fourth–order overall potential
energy.

2.1. Equations of motion

We resume the one dimensional poromechanical model introduced in [11], where
the authors have derived the equations of motion by using a variational approach much
similar to that developed in [19]; for more details we remand to [11].
Let Bs := [(cid:96)1, (cid:96)2] ⊂ R, with (cid:96)1, (cid:96)2 ∈ R, and Bf := R be the reference conﬁgurations
for the solid and ﬂuid components, see [12]. The solid placement χs : Bs×R → R is a C2
function such that the map χs(·, t), associating to each Xs ∈ Bs the position occupied
at time t by the particle labeled by Xs in the reference conﬁguration Bs, is a C2–
diﬀeomorphism. The ﬂuid placement map χf : Bf × R → R is deﬁned analogously. The
current conﬁguration Bt := χs(Bs, t) at time t is the set of positions of the superposed
solid and ﬂuid particles.

Consider the C2 function φ : Bs × R → Bf such that φ(Xs, t) is the ﬂuid particle
that at time t occupies the same position of the solid particle Xs; assume, also, that
φ(·, t) is a C2–diﬀeomorphism mapping univocally a solid particle into a ﬂuid one. The
three ﬁelds χs, χf, and φ are not at all independent1.
The Lagrangian velocities are the two maps uα : Bα × R → R deﬁned by setting
uα(Xα, t) := ∂χα/∂t for any Xα ∈ Bα, where α = s, f. We also consider the Eulerian
velocities vα : Bt × R → R associating with each point x ∈ Bt and for each time
t ∈ R the velocities of the solid and ﬂuid particle occupying the place x at time t; more
precisely we set vα(x, t) := uα(χ−1

α (x, t), t).

Since the reference conﬁguration Bs of the solid component is known a priori, we
express the dynamical observables in terms of the ﬁelds χs and φ which are deﬁned on
Bs.

Assume that the ﬂuid component of the system is acted upon by dissipative forces.
We consider the independent variations δχs and δφ of the two ﬁelds χs and φ and denote
by δW the corresponding elementary virtual work made by the dissipative forces acting
on the ﬂuid component.
The possible motions of the system, see for instance [5, Chapter 5], in an interval
of time (t1, t2) ⊂ R are those such that the ﬁelds χs and φ satisﬁes the variational
principle

dXs L( ˙χs(Xs, t), . . . , φ(Xs, t)) = −

where the Lagrangian density L is equal to the minus overall potential energy associated
to both the internal and external conservative forces; here we do not consider inertial
eﬀects. Thus, the variation of the the action integral in correspondence of a possible
motion is equal to the integral over time of minus the virtual work of the dissipative
forces corresponding to the considered variation of the ﬁelds.

In this paper we shall consider the so–called Darcy eﬀect, i.e., the dissipation due
to forces proportional to the velocity of the ﬂuid component measured with respect to
the solid, [14].

A natural expression for the virtual work of the dissipation forces acting on the

ﬂuid component and taking into account the Darcy eﬀect is

δW := −

D[vf(x, t) − vs(x, t)][δχf(χ−1

f

(2.2)

(cid:90)

where δχf is the variation of the ﬁeld χf induced by the independent variations δχs and
δφ. D > 0 is the inverse of the permeability k of the porous medium. For more details
on equation (2.2), we refer to [11] and [1].

It is reasonable to assume that the potential energy density depends on the space
and time variable only via two physically relevant functions: the strain of the solid and
a properly normalized ﬂuid mass density [11], i.e.,

ε(Xs, t) := [(χ(cid:48)

s(Xs, t))2 − 1]/2 and mf(Xs, t) := 0,f(φ(Xs, t))φ(cid:48)(Xs, t)

(2.3)
1indeed, by deﬁnition, we immediately have that χf(φ(Xs, t), t) = χs(Xs, t) for any Xs ∈ Bs and

t ∈ R

1:32

where 0,f : Bf → R is a ﬂuid reference density. In other words, we assume that the
potential energy density Φ is a function of the ﬁelds mf and ε and on their space
derivative m(cid:48)

f and ε(cid:48).

By a standard variational computation, see [11, equation (24)], one gets the equation
of motion. In this framework, we are interested in the geometrically linearized version
of such equations: we assume 0,f to be constant and introduce the displacement ﬁelds
u(Xs, t) and w(Xs, t) by setting

χs(Xs, t) = Xs + u(Xs, t) and φ(Xs, t) = Xs + w(Xs, t)

(2.4)
for any Xs ∈ Bs and t ∈ R. We then assume that u and w are small, together with
their space and time derivatives, and write

mf = 0,f(1 + w(cid:48)), m := mf − 0,f = 0,fw(cid:48), ε ≈ u(cid:48),

(2.5)

where ≈ means that all the terms of order larger than one have been neglected.
We have introduced above the ﬁeld m. In the following we shall imagine Φ as a
function of m, ε and m(cid:48) ε(cid:48) and the equations of motion and the boundary conditions
will be written in terms of these ﬁelds. We get the equations of motion [1]

and the associated boundary conditions that are compatible with the choices of Dirichlet
and Neumann boundary conditions:

(2.6)

(2.7)

Recalling that in our approximation m = 0,fw(cid:48), see the second among equations
(2.5), we have that the equations (2.6) are evolution equations for the ﬁelds m and ε.
The second between the equations of motion (2.6), thanks to a suitable choice of
Φ, see Section 2.5, will become is a Cahn–Hilliard–like equation for the ﬁeld m with
driving ﬁeld still depending parametrically on ε [11].

where the notation above means that the functions in brackets are evaluated both in (cid:96)1
and (cid:96)2. With this choice it is possible to ﬁx the boundary conditions directly on ﬁelds
m and ε (and derivatives).

The ﬁrst equation (2.8) is the additional boundary condition due to the presence of
the gradient terms in the potential energy density Φ. This equation speciﬁes essential
boundary conditions on the derivatives of the displacement ﬁelds or natural boundary
conditions on the so called double forces, see [16] and the next Subsection 2.4. The
generalized essential boundary conditions can be read as a prescription on the deriva-
tive of the independent ﬁelds χs and φ, see equations (2.3); whilst the extended natural

boundary conditions prescribe, on one hand, the additional forces which the solid con-
tinuum is able to balance at the boundary and, on the other, the wetting properties of
the ﬂuid which ﬁlls the pores [20].

The second equation (2.8) provide natural boundary conditions prescribing the
chemical potential of the ﬂuid, so that the ﬂuid is free to ﬂow trough both the two
boundaries. For a more detailed discussion on this boundary condition see [1] and [2].

Finally, we get the PDE problem

2.3. The one–side impermeable problem

A very interesting situation in applications is the one in which one of the two

boundaries is not permeable to the ﬂuid.
This physical situation can be mathematically implemented assuming that, at any
time t, the seepage velocity, say v = uf − us = − ˙w, to identically vanish and therefore
the boundary to be impermeable to the ﬂuid ﬂow, see [1]. Considering the bulk equation
(2.6)2 this boundary condition can therefore be rephrased as follows:

Thus, it follows that a set of boundary conditions implying that (2.7) are satisﬁed

In order to explain the subsequent choice of homogeneous Neumann boundary con-
ditions (see Sections 3 and 4), we brieﬂy resume the main concepts of second–gradient
theories in the one–dimensional case. The external working at the boundaries for a
biphasic second gradient porous medium is [18, 19]

Here tα are the tractions and τα are the double forces, α = s, f . According to [16]
and [15], in the one dimensional case, the double force τα can be regarded as the rate
of dilatancy.
Recall now the ﬁrst equation (2.7); this condition can be satisﬁed in two cases, i.e.
by setting δε = δm = 0 or ∂Φ/∂ε(cid:48) = ∂Φ/∂m(cid:48) = 0. The ﬁrst choice is that of [1, 11] and
it was obtained thanks to Dirichlet boundary conditions, while the second option can
be obtained by choosing Neumann homogenous boundary conditions ε(cid:48)((cid:96)1) = ε(cid:48)((cid:96)2) =
m(cid:48)((cid:96)1) = m(cid:48)((cid:96)2) = 0, thus setting the double forces equal to zero in both the two
boundaries. The last one is the choice of the present paper, so that here we do not
allow dilatancy at the boundaries of the porous material.

Neumann boundary conditions in this context are interesting not only for a more
realistic scenario with respect to Dirichlet boundary conditions, but also because they
introduce both analytic and numerical complications. In fact, in this case the solution
is not unique, so that a various set of stationary solutions has to be studied, as we
will see in Section 3; regarding this point, an analytic result about the position of the
interface (one of the stationary solutions) between the two phases (poor and rich in
ﬂuid content) has been proven in Subsection 3.2.

2.5. Overall potential energy

We specialize the Porous Medium model we are studying by choosing the second

gradient part of the dimensionless potential energy, that is we assume

Φ(m(cid:48), ε(cid:48), m, ε) :=

1
2

[k1(ε(cid:48))2 + 2k2ε(cid:48)m(cid:48) + k3(m(cid:48))2] + Ψ(m, ε),

(2.14)
2 ≥ 0. These parameters provide energy
with k1, k3 > 0, k2 ∈ R such that k1k3 − k2
penalties for the formation of interfaces; they have the physical dimensions of squared
lengths and, according with the above mentioned conditions, provide a well–grounded
identiﬁcation of the intrinsic characteristic lengths of the one–dimensional porous con-
tinuum.

Moreover, we consider the following expression for the total potential energy density
in the perspective of describing the transition between a ﬂuid–poor and a ﬂuid–rich
phase

Ψ(m, ε) :=

m2(3m2− 8bεm + 6b2ε2) + ΨB(m, ε)

where

is the Biot potential energy density [3], a > 0 is the ratio between the ﬂuid and the
solid rigidity, b > 0 is a coupling between the ﬂuid and the solid component, p > 0 is
the external pressure, and α > 0 is a material parameter responsible for the showing
up of an additional equilibrium.

The choice (2.14) is due to the fact that we want to study diﬀusive interfaces, so
that a second–gradient model is needed. For more details on this particular choice and
second–gradient theories we remand to [11] and [18, 19].

lems for the porous medium we are studying by specifying two diﬀerent sets of boundary

It is easy to show that in both cases the boundary conditions imply that, see also [11,
equation (40) and related discussion], ∂Φ/∂m − (∂Φ/∂m(cid:48))(cid:48) = 0, so that for both the
problems the stationary solutions are the solutions of the PDE problem

3.1. Constant and interfaces stationary solutions

Here we discuss the stationary Problem (3.18), with the choiche (2.14), (2.15) and
with homegenous Neumann natural boundary conditions, so that system (3.18) becomes

 −(2/3)αbm3 + αb2m2ε + p + ε − ab(m − bε) − k1ε(cid:48)(cid:48) − k2m(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0,

αm3 − 2αbm2ε + αb2mε2 + a(m − bε) − k2ε(cid:48)(cid:48) − k3m(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0,
ε(cid:48)((cid:96)1) = m(cid:48)((cid:96)1) = ε(cid:48)((cid:96)2) = m(cid:48)((cid:96)2) = 0.

(3.19)

The problem with these boundary conditions is interesting because here we do not
force the formation of the interface by prescribing the two phases at the boundaries
as in the Dirichlet boundary conditions case discussed in [1]. Equation (3.19) has not
a unique solution, and the interface is one of them. The reason of this choiche, that
is a physically natural choice (see Subsection 2.4), is that we want to understand (in
particular in the dynamic case) if and how the ﬂuid bubble inside the porous medium
is formed.
In Figure 3.1 are depicted four types of solution of problem (3.19). We found
numerically these solutions with k1 = k2 = k3 = 10−3 via the ﬁnite diﬀerence method
powered with the Newton-Raphson algorithm. The use of diﬀerent initial guess in the
Newton-Raphson algorithm has allowed us to ﬁnd numerically the diﬀerent stationary
solutions. The solutions reported here are those of main interest since they represent
the two phases of the system, ﬂuid–poor and ﬂuid–rich phases respectively, the single
interface solution, which as we will prove in Subsection 3.2 is practically the same
of [1, 11] (see Remark 3.1 in 3.2), and a double interface solution, that is characteristic
of dynamics with Neumann homogeneous boundary conditions.

3.2. General result on kink localization

Here we prove that the interface–like solution to Problem (3.19) is the same as that
of the Problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions, see [1,10,11]. In fact, in [10], it has

respectively.

to the stationary problem (3.18) can be reduced to the computation of a deﬁnite integral

The root locus of the constraint curve ∂V (x, y)/∂y = 0 is made of a certain number of
maximal components such that each of them is the graph of a function x ∈ R → y(x) ∈
R; for each of them the ﬁrst between the two equations (3.22) becomes a one–ﬁeld one–
dimensional problem. Since the function V is obtained by rotating the coordinate axes,
then at the coexistence pressure it has the two absolute minimum points (xs, ys) and
(xf, yf) corresponding, respectively, to the standard and to the ﬂuid–rich phases. Since
(ms, εs) and (mf, εf) satisfy the equations ∂Ψ(m, ε)/∂m = 0 and ∂Ψ(m, ε)/∂ε = 0, we
have that the two points (xs, ys) and (xf, yf) are solutions of the constraint equation
∂V (x, y)/∂y = 0 and hence they belong to the constraint curve.

By (3.40) we get (3.37). The proof of (3.30) is now just an extension of the proof of
Theorem 2 of [10].

From (3.33), (3.37) and [10] we get (3.31), where a and b correspond to the ﬂuid–
poor and ﬂuid–rich phases of (3.19) so that we can state that the interface position is
the same in both Dirichlet and Neumann–Neumann homogeneous boundary conditions.
Actually the authors of [10] determined the position of the interface between the ﬂuid–
poor and the ﬂuid–rich phases that turned out to be Xs = 0.6164 in agreement with
the numerical simulations, see the third row of Figure 3.1.

Remark 3.1. At the end of Subsection 3.1 we said that the solution are “practically”
the same becouse the zero energy level can not be reached, in this case of Neumann
boundary conditions, as for a qualitative analysis point of view, we are considering
trajectories starting and ending with velocity zero. The values a and b are only limit
(for k → 0) values.

4. The not stationary problem

In this section we discuss the not stationary solution of the problems (2.9) and
(2.12) with homogenous Neumann natural boundary conditions. This choice appears
to be very natural if one does not want to prescribe the two phases at the boundaries
via Dirichlet boundary conditions. Now, the physical problem of main interest is that of
asking: “is there the possibility of the spontaneous formation of a bubble inside a porous
medium in the neighborhood of the impermeable wall?”, “how does this phenomenon
happen? and for which initial conditions?”

As we will show below, in order to answer to these questions and to understand
this phenomenon we have studied numerically Problems (2.9) and (2.12) with piecewise
initial conditions.

The stationary solutions are several (see Section 3), so that the dynamics with or
without an impermeable wall, starting with the same initial condition, could possibly
lead to diﬀerent ﬁnal states.

the choiche (2.14), (2.15) and with homegenous Neumann natural boundary conditions

for the one–side impermeable problem (2.12).

The dissipative evolution of the elastic strain ε and the ﬂuid mass density varia-
tions m, relative to the zero chemical potential boundary condition and the one–side
impermeability condition, are discussed for four type of diﬀerent initial conditions, say:
three diﬀerent piecewise initial condition and a piecewise condition with a continuos
junction.

In the one–side impermeble case we were able to obtain diﬀerent ﬁnal states corre-
sponding to diﬀerent stationary solutions (with respect to those of the evolution without
the impermeable wall) of the problem, see ﬁgure 3.1. In the case of a piecewise initial
condition, depending on the ﬂuid–poor portion of the medium s and the water level
h of the m proﬁle (and corresponding ε proﬁle) of the initial state, we obtained these
diﬀerent solutions, as reported in Table 1.

Table 1: ﬂuid–poor portion of the medium s, water level h of the initial m proﬁle and
ﬁnal state of the dynamics with impermeable condition.

The choice of these piecewise conditions is that it is straightforward to expect an
accumulation of ﬂuid in the neighborhood of the impermeable wall as the level h grows
(with s remaining ﬁxed), so that the ﬂuid could remain trapped into the porous medium,
thus giving a dynamics towards a stationary solution of interface type. On the other
hand, it is also possible that, if the ﬂuid level h is too high, also the dynamics without
the impermeable wall can lead to a not constant stationary solution (see Figure 4.3 and
discussion below), so that it is important to study thoroughly the eﬀects of the more
(or the less) amount of ﬂuid in the initial state, in order to obtain diﬀerent ﬁnal states
for the dynamics with the two diﬀerent natural boundary conditions.

4.1. Piecewise initial conditions

In ﬁgures 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 we report the evolution of the system starting from three

diﬀerent piecewise initial states.

The ﬁrst condition, corresponding to case 8 of Table 1, is an evolution for which
the ﬁnal state in both cases (zero–chemical and one–side–impermeable problem) is the
same.
In fact, as can be seen in Figure 4.3, in both cases the motion is divided in
two steps, the same as the evolutions studied in [1], i.e. the formation of the ε and m
proﬁles and the slow motion towards the not costant (interfaces) stationary solutions.
The main reason of the similar evolution in both cases is the fact that the amount of
water of the initial state is very high (see Section above), so that the formation of the
interfaces is a direct consequence. Even if the ﬁnal state of both the evolutions is the
same, some diﬀerences can be observed in the ﬁrst step of the evolutions. In the case
without the impermeable wall, water can enter from the right boundary so that the
formation of the proﬁle is not only quicker but also more straightforward, as conﬁrmed
by the velocity proﬁle, than the ﬁrst step with the impermeable wall. In fact, in this
last case, due to the presence of the wall, the ﬂuid has to slowly accumulate in the
neighborhood of the right boundary, giving rise to depression phenomena in the ﬁrst
moments of evolution (see the ﬁrst three rows of Figure 4.3).

The evolution depicted in Figure 4.4 corresponds to case 7 of of Table 1. In this
case, the dry portion of the medium being the same, the water level of the initial state
is less with respect to case 8 so that the evolution without an impermeable wall ends
with the classical consolidation of a porous medium (the ﬂuid ﬂows out completely)
and the ﬁnal state is the standard poor–ﬂuid state (εs, ms). On the other hand, the
corresponding evolution with an impermeable wall has a diﬀerent beahvoiur, actually

acs-neumann.tex – 2 marzo 2016

13

1:32

the same behaviour of the previous case 8 and that of the the evolutions studied in
[1]. The way of ﬂuid emptying in the zero–chemical potential evolution is ﬁrst the
accumulation of the initial state ﬂuid in the center of the medium, thus giving rise to
a double–interface–like proﬁle (as can be observed by the velocity proﬁle), then the
symmetric slow release of the ﬂuid through the boundaries. Regarding the evolution in
the one–side–impermeable case, the ﬁrst step of dynamics is slight diﬀerent from that
of Figure 4.3; in fact in this case, due to the less amount of water of the initial state,
the depression phenomenon before the ﬂuid accumulation in the neighborhood of the
roght boundary is much more appreciable.

Finally we analyze the evolution of Figure 4.5, which refers to case 1. The water
level of the initial state is the same as that of case 7, but the dry portion of the medium
is much less. The evolution with the impermeability is quite diﬀerent in this case. In
fact, the ﬁnal state corresponds to the fourth case of Figure 3.1, i.e. a double interface.
The ﬂuid amount of the initial state is not enough to produce a single–interface proﬁle,
but not so little to let all the water exit from the left boundary. The result is that the
ﬂuid remains trapped in the center of the medium instead of in its right part. In this
case, the water depression is observed in the center of the porous medium. It is worth
to note that the ﬁnal velocity proﬁle is the same of that of the cases studied in [1], but
duplicated.

In this case the evolution of the system without impermeable wall is quite similar

to that of Figure 4.3.

4.2. Piecewiese continuous initial condition

The evolution depicted in Figure 4.6 represents the dynamics described by Problems
(2.9) and (2.12) with the impermeabilty in (cid:96)1 instead of (cid:96)2. The initial state is a
piecewise function with a continuous junction between the ﬂuid–poor (εs, ms) and the
ﬂuid–rich phase (εf , mf ).
In this case, like those of Figures 4.4 and 4.5, the ﬁnal
state of the evolution is diﬀerent with the diﬀerent natural boundary conditions. The
evolution with the impermeability condition is very similar to that of the the evolutions
studied in [1], as can be seen by the ﬁnal shape of the velocity proﬁle in Figure 4.6.
The dynamics without the impermeable wall is just a process of ﬂuid ﬁlling inside
the medium so that, when the ﬂuid–rich state is reached, the evolution ends and the
velocity proﬁle is identically zero.

The reason for this behaviour is that, at the beginning, the medium is almost
ﬁlled with the ﬂuid and the possibility of ﬂowing trough the left boundary quickly ﬁlls
the whole bar with water while, in the case of impermeability, a water depression in
the neighborhood, remaains as a feature of the whole evolution, thus leading to the
formation of the interface, which is the most close solution to the initial state.

The choice of this initial state is that of (numerically) investigating the occurence
of diﬀerent ﬁnal states (with diﬀerent boundary conditions) in the presence of a water
depression in the neighborhood of the left boundary.

With this choice we proved that, in the case of the one-side–impermeable problem,
if the evolution starts with a water depression, due to the wall, the depression remains
during the whole evolution.

5. Conclusions

Here we studied the dissipative dynamics of a porous material under consolida-
tion. Thanks to a second gradient total potential energy, see Section 2.5, we modeled
heterogenous elastic strain and ﬂuid density variations for the consolidating porous
medium. The overall potential energy, introduced in previous works [8, 11] describes a
kind of phase transition between a ﬂuid–poor and a ﬂuid–rich phase inside the porous
network.

We studied the problem of ﬂuid–segregation in the consolidating dynamics of the
porous medium with pure Darcy dissipation, considering two kinds of evolutions: the
ﬁrst without an impermeable wall at one of the boundaries (zero–chemical potential
problem, see Subsection 2.2) and the other one with the impermeable wall (one–side
impermeable problem, see Subsection 2.3). Thanks to Neumann boundary conditions,
thus without prescribing the formation of the interfaces between the two phases, we
found that the impermeable wall higly inﬂuences the motion; in fact, the dynamics
with the impermeable wall ends with the ﬂuid–segregation inside the porous medium,
whereas without the wall the dynamics goes toward the standard phase solution and
the soil consolidates.

The stationary problem is the same for both zero–chemical and one–side–impermeable

problems. We were able to prove that, with Neumann homogenous boundary condi-
tions, the position of the interface is the same of the case of Dirichlet essential boundary
conditions.
