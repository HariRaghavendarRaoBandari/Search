Abstract

We prove a new duality theorem for the category of precontact algebras
which implies the Stone Duality Theorem, its connected version obtained in
[16], the recent duality theorems from [3, 23], and some new duality theorems
for the category of contact algebras and for the category of complete contact
algebras.

Introduction

This paper is a continuation of the papers [13, 15, 16] and, to some extent, of the
papers [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 29]. In it we prove a new duality theorem for the category
of precontact algebras which implies the Stone Duality Theorem, its connected version
obtained in [16], the recent duality theorems from [3, 23], and some new duality
theorems for the category of contact algebras and for the category of complete contact
algebras. More precisely, we show that there exists a duality functor Ga between the
category PCA of all precontact algebras and suitable morphisms between them and
the category PCS of all 2-precontact spaces and suitable morphisms between them.
Then, clearly, ﬁxing some full subcategory C of the category PCA, we obtain a
duality between the categories C and Ga(C). Finding categories which are isomorphic
or equivalent to the category C and (or) to the category Ga(C), we obtain as corollaries
the Stone Duality and the other dualities mentioned above. For example, when C is

in this way we obtain the Stone Duality

similar way the connected version of the Stone Duality Theorem, described in [16].

The structure of the paper is the following. In Section 2 we give the necessary
preliminary results and deﬁnitions. In Section 3 we prove our main theorem, namely,
the duality theorem for precontact algebras, and obtain as corollaries the theorems
mentioned above.

We now ﬁx the notations.
All lattices are with top (= unit) and bottom (= zero) elements, denoted re-

spectively by 1 and 0. We do not require the elements 0 and 1 to be distinct.

If (X, T) is a topological space and M is a subset of X, we denote by cl(X,T)(M)
(or simply by cl(M) or clX (M)) the closure of M in (X, T) and by int(X,T)(M) (or
brieﬂy by int(M) or intX(M)) the interior of M in (X, T). The compact spaces are
not assumed to be Hausdorﬀ (as it is adopted in [20]).

If X is a topological space, we denote by CO(X) the set of all clopen (=closed

and open) subsets of X. Obviously, (CO(X), ∪, ∩, \, ∅, X) is a Boolean algebra.

If X is a set, we denote by 2X the power set of X.
The set of all ultraﬁlters of a Boolean algebra B is denoted by U lt(B).
If C denotes a category, we write X ∈ |C| if X is an object of C, and f ∈ C(X, Y )

if f is a morphism of C with domain X and codomain Y .

The main reference books for all notions which are not deﬁned here are [1, 20,

24].

2 Preliminaries

We will ﬁrst recall the notions of precontact algebra and contact algebra. They can be
regarded as algebraic analogues of proximity spaces (see [19, 26, 4, 2, 25] for proximity
spaces).

Deﬁnition 2.1. An algebraic system B = (B, C) is called a precontact algebra ([17])
(abbreviated as PCA) if the following holds:

• B = (B, 0, 1, +, ., ∗) is a Boolean algebra (where the complement is denoted by

“∗”);

•

C is a binary relation on B (called a precontact relation) satisfying the following
axioms:

(C0)

If aCb then a 6= 0 and b 6= 0;

(C+)

aC(b + c) iﬀ aCb or aCc; (a + b)Cc iﬀ aCc or bCc.

2

A precontact algebra (B, C) is said to be complete if the Boolean algebra B is com-
plete. Two precontact algebras B = (B, C) and B1 = (B1, C1) are said to be PCA-
isomorphic (or, simply, isomorphic) if there exists a PCA-isomorphism between them,
i.e., a Boolean isomorphism ϕ : B −→ B1 such that, for every a, b ∈ B, aCb iﬀ
ϕ(a)C1ϕ(b).

The negation of the relation C is denoted by (−C).
For any PCA (B, C), we deﬁne a binary relation “ ≪C” on B (called non-

tangential inclusion) by

(1)

a ≪C b ↔ a(−C)b∗.

Sometimes we will write simply “ ≪” instead of “ ≪C”.

We will also consider precontact algebras satisfying some additional axioms:

(Cref )

If a 6= 0 then aCa (reﬂexivity axiom);

(Csym)

If aCb then bCa (symmetry axiom);

(Ctr)

If a ≪C c then (∃b)(a ≪C b ≪C c) (transitivity axiom);

(Ccon)

If a 6= 0, 1 then aCa∗ or a∗Ca (connectedness axiom).

A precontact algebra (B, C) is called a contact algebra ([13]) (and C is called
a contact relation) if it satisﬁes the axioms (Cref ) and (Csym). We say that
two contact algebras are CA-isomorphic if they are PCA-isomorphic; also, a PCA-
isomorphism between two contact algebras will be called a CA-isomorphism.

A precontact algebra (B, C) is called connected if it satisﬁes the axiom (Ccon).

Lemma 2.2. Let (B, C) be a precontact algebra. Deﬁne

aC #b ⇐⇒ ((aCb) ∨ (bCa) ∨ (a.b 6= 0)).

Then C # is a contact relation on B and hence (B, C #) is a contact algebra.

Remark 2.3. We will also consider precontact algebras satisfying the following vari-
ant of the transitivity axiom (Ctr):
(Ctr#)

If a ≪C# c then (∃b)(a ≪C# b ≪C# c).

The axiom (Ctr#) is known as the “Interpolation axiom”.
A contact algebra (B, C) is called a normal contact algebra ([6, 21]) if it satisﬁes

the axiom (Ctr#) and the following one:
(C6) If a 6= 1 then there exists b 6= 0 such that b(−C)a.
The notion of a normal contact algebra was introduced by Fedorchuk [21] (under the
name of “Boolean δ-algebra”) as an equivalent expression of the notion of a compingent
Boolean algebra of de Vries [6] (see its deﬁnition below). We call such algebras “normal
contact algebras” because they form a subclass of the class of contact algebras and
naturally arise in normal Hausdorﬀ spaces.

The relations C and ≪ are inter-deﬁnable. For example, normal contact al-
gebras could be equivalently deﬁned (and exactly in this way they were introduced
(under the name of compingent Boolean algebras) by de Vries in [6]) as a pair of a

3

Boolean algebra B = (B, 0, 1, +, ., ∗) and a binary relation ≪ on B subject to the
following axioms:
(≪1) a ≪ b implies a ≤ b;
(≪2) 0 ≪ 0;
(≪3) a ≤ b ≪ c ≤ t implies a ≪ t;
(≪4) (a ≪ b and a ≪ c) implies a ≪ b.c;
(≪5) If a ≪ c then a ≪ b ≪ c for some b ∈ B;
(≪6) If a 6= 0 then there exists b 6= 0 such that b ≪ a;
(≪7) a ≪ b implies b∗ ≪ a∗.

Note that if 0 6= 1 then the axiom (≪2) follows from the axioms (≪3), (≪4),

(≪6) and (≪7).

Obviously, contact algebras could be equivalently deﬁned as a pair of a Boolean
algebra B and a binary relation ≪ on B subject to the axioms (≪1)-(≪4) and (≪7);
then, clearly, the relation ≪ satisﬁes also the axioms
(≪2’) 1 ≪ 1;
(≪4’) (a ≪ c and b ≪ c) implies (a + b) ≪ c.

It is not diﬃcult to see that precontact algebras could be equivalently deﬁned
as a pair of a Boolean algebra B and a binary relation ≪ on B subject to the axioms
(≪2), (≪2’), (≪3), (≪4) and (≪4’).

It is easy to see that axiom (C6) can be stated equivalently in the form of (≪6).

Now we will give some examples of precontact and contact algebras. We will

start with the extremal contact relations.

Example 2.4. Let B be a Boolean algebra. Then there exist a largest and a smallest
contact relations on B; the largest one, ρl (sometimes we will write ρB
l ), is deﬁned by

aρlb ⇐⇒ (a 6= 0 and b 6= 0),

and the smallest one, ρs (sometimes we will write ρB

s ), by

Note that, for a, b ∈ B,

aρsb ⇐⇒ a.b 6= 0.

a ≪ρs b ⇐⇒ a ≤ b;

hence a ≪ρs a, for any a ∈ B. Thus (B, ρs) is a normal contact algebra.

We are now going to recall the deﬁnition of an adjacency space ([22], [17]) and
the fact that each adjacency space generates canonically a precontact algebra ([17]).
By an adjacency space (see [22] and [17]) we mean a relational system (W, R),
where W is a non-empty set whose elements are called cells, and R is a binary relation
on W called the adjacency relation; the subsets of W are called regions.
The reﬂexive and symmetric closure R♭ of R is deﬁned as follows:

(2)

xR♭y ⇐⇒ ((xRy) ∨ (yRx) ∨ (x = y)).

4

A precontact relation CR between the regions of an adjacency space (W, R) is

deﬁned as follows: for every M, N ⊆ W ,

(3)

M CRN iﬀ (∃x ∈ M)(∃y ∈ N)(xRy).

Proposition 2.5. ([17]) Let (W, R) be an adjacency space and let 2W be the Boolean
algebra of all subsets of W . Then:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(2W , CR) is a precontact algebra;

(2W , CR) is a contact algebra iﬀ R is a reﬂexive and symmetric relation on W .
If R is a reﬂexive and symmetric relation on W then CR coincides with (CR)#
and CR♭;

CR satisﬁes the axiom (Ctr) iﬀ R is a transitive relation on W ;

CR satisﬁes the axiom (Ccon) iﬀ R is a connected relation on W (which means
that if x, y ∈ W and x 6= y then there is an R-path from x to y or from y to x).

Clearly, Proposition 2.5(a) implies that if B is a Boolean subalgebra of the
Boolean algebra 2W , then (B, CR) is also a precontact algebra (here (and further on),
for simplicity, we denote again by CR the restriction of the relation CR to B).

We recall as well that every topological space generates canonically a contact

algebra.

2.6. Let X be a topological space and let RC(X) be the set of all regular closed
subsets of X (recall that a subset F of X is said to be regular closed if F = cl(int(F ))).
Let us equip RC(X) with the following Boolean operations and contact relation CX:

•

•

•

•

•

F + G = F ∪ G;

F ∗ = cl(X \ F );

F.G = cl(int(F ∩ G))(= (F ∗ ∪ G∗)∗);

0 = ∅, 1 = X;

F CXG iﬀ F ∩ G 6= ∅.

The following lemma is a well-known fact.

Lemma 2.7. Let X be a topological space. Then

(RC(X), CX) = (RC(X), 0, 1, +, ., ∗, CX)

is a complete contact algebra.

The contact algebras of the type (RC(X), CX), where X is a topological space,

are called standard contact algebras.

5

Deﬁnition 2.8. ([15, 16]) Let B = (B, C) be a precontact algebra and let U1, U2 be
ultraﬁlters of B. We set

(4)

U1RBU2 iﬀ (∀a ∈ U1)(∀b ∈ U2)(aCb) (i.e., iﬀ U1 × U2 ⊆ C).

The relational system (U lt(B), RB) is called the canonical adjacency space of

B.

We say that U1, U2 are connected iﬀ U1(RB)♭U2 (see (2) for the notation R♭).

Deﬁnition 2.9. ([15, 16]) Let X be a non-empty topological space and R be a binary
relation on X. Then the pair (CO(X), CR) (see (3) for CR) is a precontact algebra (by
Proposition 2.5(a)), called the canonical precontact algebra of the relational system
(X, R).

Deﬁnition 2.10. ([15, 16]) An adjacency space (X, R) is called a topological ad-
jacency space (abbreviated as TAS) if X is a topological space and R is a closed
relation on X. When X is a compact Hausdorﬀ zero-dimensional space (i.e., when
X is a Stone space), we say that the topological adjacency space (X, R) is a Stone
adjacency space.

Two topological adjacency spaces (X, R) and (X1, R1) are said to be TAS-
isomorphic if there exists a homeomorphism f : X −→ X1 such that, for every
x, y ∈ X, xRy iﬀ f (x)R1f (y).

Recall that:

(a) a topological space X is called a Stone space if it is a compact Hausdorﬀ zero-
dimensional space;
(b) the Stone space S(A) of a Boolean algebra A is the set X = U lt(A) endowed with
a topology T having as a closed base the family {sA(a) | a ∈ A}, where

(5)

sA(a) = {u ∈ X | a ∈ u},

for every a ∈ A; then

S(A) = (X, T)

is a compact Hausdorﬀ zero-dimensional space (i.e.,
sA(A) = CO(X) and the Stone map

it is indeed a Stone space),

(6)

sA : A −→ CO(X), a 7→ sA(a),

is a Boolean isomorphism; also, the family {sA(a) | a ∈ A} is an open base of (X, T).
Further, for every Stone space X and for every x ∈ X, we set

(7)

ux = {P ∈ CO(X) | x ∈ P }

(sometimes we will also write uX
map

x instead of ux). Then ux ∈ U lt(CO(X)) and the

f : X −→ S(CO(X)), x 7→ ux,

is a homeomorphism.

When B = (B, C) is a precontact algebra, the pair (S(B), RB) is said to be the

canonical Stone adjacency space of B.

6

Theorem 2.11. ([15, 16]) (a) Each precontact algebra B = (B, C) is isomorphic
to the canonical precontact algebra (CO(X, T), CRB) of the Stone adjacency space
((X, T), RB), where (X, T) = S(B) and for every u, v ∈ X, uRBv ⇐⇒ u × v ⊆ C;
the isomorphism between them is just the Stone map sB : B −→ CO(X, T). Moreover,
the relation C satisﬁes the axiom (Cref ) (resp., (Csym); (Ctr)) iﬀ the relation RB is
reﬂexive (resp., symmetric; transitive).
(b) There exists a bijective correspondence between the class of all, up to PCA-
isomorphism, precontact algebras and the class of all, up to TAS-isomorphism, Stone
adjacency spaces (X, R); namely, for each precontact algebra B = (B, C), the PCA-
isomorphism class [B] of B corresponds to the TAS-isomorphism class of the canonical
Stone adjacency space (S(B), RB) of B, and for each Stone adjacency space (X, R),
the TAS-isomorphism class [(X, R)] of (X, R) corresponds to the PCA-isomorphism
class of the canonical precontact algebra (CO(X), CR) of (X, R) (see (3) for CR).

Let us also recall the following well known statement (see, e.g., [5], p.271).

Lemma 2.12. Let X be a dense subspace of a topological space Y . Then the functions

and

r : RC(Y ) −→ RC(X), F 7→ F ∩ X,

e : RC(X) −→ RC(Y ), G 7→ clY (G),

are Boolean isomorphisms between Boolean algebras RC(X) and RC(Y ), and e ◦ r =
idRC(Y ), r ◦ e = idRC(X). (We will sometimes write rX,Y (resp., eX,Y ) instead of r
(resp., e).)

Deﬁnition 2.13. ([15, 16]) (a) Let X be a topological space and X0 be a dense
subspace of X. Then the pair (X, X0) is called a topological pair.

(b) Let (X, X0) be a topological pair. Then we set

(8)

RC(X, X0) = {clX (A) | A ∈ CO(X0)}.

Lemma 2.14. ([15, 16]) Let (X, X0) be a topological pair. Then RC(X, X0) ⊆
RC(X); the set RC(X, X0) with the standard Boolean operations on the regular
closed subsets of X is a Boolean subalgebra of RC(X); RC(X, X0) is isomorphic
to the Boolean algebra CO(X0); the sets RC(X) and RC(X, X0) coincide iﬀ X0 is
an extremally disconnected space. If

C(X,X0)

is the restriction of the contact relation CX (see Lemma 2.7) to RC(X, X0), then
(RC(X, X0), C(X,X0)) is a contact subalgebra of (RC(X), CX).

Deﬁnition 2.15. Let B = (B, C) be a precontact algebra. A non-empty subset Γ of
B is called a clan if it satisﬁes the following conditions:

(Clan1)

0 6∈ Γ;

7

(Clan2)

If a ∈ Γ and a ≤ b then b ∈ Γ;

(Clan3)

If a + b ∈ Γ then a ∈ Γ or b ∈ Γ;

(Clan4)

If a, b ∈ Γ then aC #b.

The set of all clans of a precontact algebra B is denoted by Clans(B).
Recall that a non-empty subset of a Boolean algebra B is called a grill if it
satisﬁes the axioms (Clan1)-(Clan3). The set of all grills of B will be denoted by
Grills(B).

We will need the following well-known lemma (see, e.g., [28]):

Lemma 2.16. (Grill Lemma.) If F is a ﬁlter of a Boolean algebra B and G is a
grill of B such that F ⊆ G then there exists an ultraﬁlter U of B with F ⊆ U ⊆ G.

Notation 2.17. Let (X, T) be a topological space, X0 be a subspace of X, x ∈ X
and B be a subalgebra of the Boolean algebra (RC(X), +, ., ∗, ∅, X) deﬁned in 2.6.
We put

(9)

σB
x = {F ∈ B | x ∈ F }; Γx,X0 = {F ∈ CO(X0) | x ∈ clX (F )}.

We set also

(10)

νB
x = {F ∈ B | x ∈ intX(F )}.

When B = RC(X), we will often write simply σx and νx instead of, respectively,

σB
x and νB

x as well.

x ; in this case we will sometimes use the notation σX

x and νX

Deﬁnition 2.18. (2-Precontact spaces.)([15, 16])
(a) A triple X = (X, X0, R) is called a 2-precontact space (abbreviated as PCS) if the
following conditions are satisﬁed:

(P CS1)

(X, X0) is a topological pair and X is a T0-space;

(P CS2)

(X0, R) is a Stone adjacency space;

(P CS3) RC(X, X0) is a closed base for X;

(P CS4)

For every F, G ∈ CO(X0), clX (F ) ∩ clX (G) 6= ∅ implies that F (CR)#G

(see (3) for CR);

(P CS5)

If Γ ∈ Clans(CO(X0), CR) then there exists a point x ∈ X such that

Γ = Γx,X0 (see (9) for Γx,X0).

(b) Let X = (X, X0, R) be a 2-precontact space. Deﬁne, for every F, G ∈ RC(X, X0),

F CX G ⇐⇒ ((∃x ∈ F ∩ X0)(∃y ∈ G ∩ X0)(xRy)).

Then the precontact algebra

B(X) = (RC(X, X0), CX)

8

is said to be the canonical precontact algebra of X.
(c) A 2-precontact space X = (X, X0, R) is called reﬂexive (resp., symmetric; transi-
tive) if the relation R is reﬂexive (resp., symmetric; transitive); X is called connected
if the space X is connected.
(d) Let X = (X, X0, R) and bX = ( bX, bX0, bR) be two 2-precontact spaces. We say that
X and bX are PCS-isomorphic (or, simply, isomorphic) if there exists a homeomor-
phism f : X −→ bX such that:

(ISO1)

f (X0) = bX0; and

(ISO2)

(∀x, y ∈ X0)(xRy ↔ f (x) bRf (y)).

Remark 2.19. ([15, 16]) It is very easy to see that the canonical precontact algebra
of a 2-precontact space, deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.18(b), is indeed a precontact algebra.

Deﬁnition 2.20. ([15, 16]) Let B = (B, C) be a precontact algebra. We associate
with B a 2-precontact space

X(B) = (X, X0, R),

called the canonical 2-precontact space of B, as follows:

• X = Clans(B) and X0 = U lt(B);

•

The topology T on the set X is deﬁned in the following way: the family

{gB(a) | a ∈ B},

where, for any a ∈ B,

(11)

gB(a) = {Γ ∈ X | a ∈ Γ},

is a closed base of T. The topology on X0 is the subspace topology induced by
(X, T).

• R = RB (see (4) for the notation RB).

Proposition 2.21. ([15, 16]) Let B = (B, C) be a precontact algebra. Then the
canonical 2-precontact space X(B) = (X, X0, R) of B deﬁned above is indeed a
2-precontact space.

Theorem 2.22. (Representation theorem for precontact algebras.)([15,
16])

(a)

Let B = (B, C) be a precontact algebra and let X(B) = (X, X0, R) be the canon-
ical 2-precontact space of B. Then the function gB : (B, C) −→ 2X, deﬁned in
(11), is a PCA-isomorphism from (B, C) onto the canonical precontact algebra
(RC(X, X0), CX(B)) of X(B). The same function gB is a PCA-isomorphism be-
tween contact algebras (B, C #) and (RC(X, X0), C(X,X0)) (see Lemma 2.14(a)
for C(X,X0)). The sets RC(X) and RC(X, X0) coincide iﬀ the precontact algebra
B is complete. The algebra B satisﬁes the axiom (Cref ) (resp., (Csym); (Ctr))
iﬀ the 2-precontact space X(B) is reﬂexive (resp., symmetric; transitive). The
algebra B is connected iﬀ X(B) is connected.

9

(b)

There exists a bijective correspondence between the class of all, up to PCA-
isomorphism, (connected) precontact algebras and the class of all, up to PCS-
isomorphism, (connected) 2-precontact spaces; namely, for every precontact al-
gebra B, the PCA-isomorphism class [B] of B corresponds to the PCS-isomor-
phism class [X(B)] of the canonical 2-precontact space X(B) of B, and for
every 2-precontact space X, the PCS-isomorphism class [X] of X corresponds
to the PCA-isomorphism class [B(X)] of the canonical precontact algebra B(X)
of X.

Corollary 2.23. ([16]) If X = (X, X0, R) is a 2-precontact space then X is a compact
space.

Proposition 2.24. ([15, 16]) Let X0 be a subspace of a topological space X. For
every F, G ∈ CO(X0), set

(12)

F δ(X,X0)G iﬀ clX(F ) ∩ clX (G) 6= ∅.

Then (CO(X0), δ(X,X0)) is a contact algebra.

Deﬁnition 2.25. (2-Contact spaces.)([15, 16]) (a) A topological pair (X, X0) is
called a 2-contact space (abbreviated as CS) if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(CS1) X is a T0-space;

(CS2) X0 is a Stone space;

(CS3) RC(X, X0) is a closed base for X;

(CS4)

If Γ ∈ Clans(CO(X0), δ(X,X0)) (see (12) for the notation δ(X,X0)) then there

exists a point x ∈ X such that Γ = Γx,X0 (see (9) for Γx,X0).

A 2-contact space (X, X0) is called connected if the space X is connected.

(b) Let (X, X0) be a 2-contact space. Then the contact algebra

Bc(X, X0) = (RC(X, X0), C(X,X0))

(see Lemma 2.14(a) for the notation C(X,X0)) is said to be the canonical contact algebra
of the 2-contact space (X, X0).

(c) Let B = (B, C) be a contact algebra, X = Clans(B, C), X0 = U lt(B) and T be
the topology on X described in Deﬁnition 2.20. Take the subspace topology on X0.
Then the pair

X c(B) = (X, X0)

is called the canonical 2-contact space of the contact algebra (B, C). (Note that X c(B)
is indeed a 2-contact space (see [16]).)
(d) Let (X, X0) and ( bX, bX0) be two 2-contact spaces. We say that (X, X0) and
( bX, bX0) are CS-isomorphic (or, simply, isomorphic) if there exists a homeomorphism
f : X −→ bX such that f (X0) = bX0.

10

Corollary 2.26. ([16]) If X = (X, X0, R) is a 2-contact space then X is a compact
space.

Deﬁnition 2.27. (Stone 2-spaces.)([16])
(a) A topological pair (X, X0) is called a Stone 2-space (abbreviated as S2S) if it
satisﬁes conditions (CS1)-(CS3) of Deﬁnition 2.25 and the following condition:

(S2S4)

If Γ ∈ Grills(CO(X0)) then there exists a point x ∈ X such that Γ = Γx,X0

(see (9) for Γx,X0).

(b) Let (X, X0) and ( bX, bX0) be two Stone 2-spaces. We say that (X, X0) and ( bX, bX0)
are S2S-isomorphic (or, simply, isomorphic) if there exists a homeomorphism f :
X −→ bX such that f (X0) = bX0.

Deﬁnition 2.28. ([16]) Let (X, X0) and (X ′, X ′
X −→ X ′ be a continuous map. Then f is called a 2-map if f (X0) ⊆ X ′
0.

0) be two Stone 2-spaces and f :

The category of all Stone 2-spaces and all 2-maps between them will be denoted

by 2Stone.

The category of all Boolean algebras and all Boolean homomorphisms between

them will be denoted by Bool.

Recall that a topological space X is said to be semiregular if RC(X) is a closed

base for X.

Deﬁnition 2.29. ([13]) A semiregular T0-space (X, T) is said to be C-semiregular
if for every clan Γ in (RC(X), CX) there exists a point x ∈ X such that Γ = σx (see
(9) for σx).

Proposition 2.30. ([13, Fact 4.1]) Every C-semiregular space X is a compact space.

Deﬁnition 2.31. ([16]) Let (X, T) be a topological space and x ∈ X. The point
x is said to be an u-point if for every U, V ∈ T, x ∈ cl(U) ∩ cl(V ) implies that
x ∈ cl(U ∩ V ).

Theorem 2.32. ([16]) If X is C-semiregular and

X0 = {x ∈ X | x is an u-point of X},

then the pair (X, X0) is a 2-contact space and X0 is a dense extremally disconnected
compact Hausdorﬀ subspace of X; moreover, X0 is the unique dense extremally dis-
connected compact Hausdorﬀ subspace of X.

Lemma 2.33. ([16]) If (X, X0) is a 2-contact space and X0 is extremally discon-
nected, then X is C-semiregular.

3 The Main Theorem and its corollaries

The next lemma is obvious.

Lemma 3.1. Let A be a subalgebra of a Boolean algebra B and (B, C) be a precontact
algebra. Then (A, C ∩ A2) is a precontact algebra and if Γ ∈ Clans(B, C) then
Γ ∩ A ∈ Clans(A, C ∩ A2).

We will need also a lemma from [16, 13].

Lemma 3.2. ([16, 13]) Let X be a topological space, B be a subalgebra of the Boolean
algebra (RC(X), +, ., ∗, ∅, X) (deﬁned in 2.6), Γ be a grill of B, x ∈ X and Γ ⊆ σB
x .
Then νB

x ⊆ Γ (see (10) for νB

x and (9) for σB

x ).

Deﬁnition 3.3. Let PCA be the category of all precontact algebras and all Boolean
homomorphisms ϕ : (B, C) −→ (B ′, C ′) between them such that, for all a, b ∈ B,
ϕ(a)C ′ϕ(b) implies that aCb.

Let PCS be the category of all 2-precontact spaces and all continuous maps
0 and, for every

0, R′) between them such that f (X0) ⊆ X ′

f : (X, X0, R) −→ (X ′, X ′
x, y ∈ X0, xRy implies that f (x)R′f (y).

The proof of the next theorem is similar in some of its parts to the proof of [16,
Theorem 8.17] but, for convenience of the reader, we give here all necessary details.

Theorem 3.4. (The Main Theorem: A Duality Theorem for Precontact
Algebras) The categories PCA and PCS are dually equivalent. In fact, the con-
travariant functor Ga : PCA −→ PCS deﬁned by Ga(B) = X(B) on the objects B
of the category PCA, and by Ga(ϕ) : Ga(B ′) −→ Ga(B), Γ 7→ ϕ−1(Γ), for every
PCA-morphism ϕ : B −→ B ′, is a duality functor.

Proof. We will ﬁrst deﬁne two contravariant functors

Ga : PCA −→ PCS and Gt : PCS −→ PCA.

Let X = (X, X0, R) ∈ |PCS|. Deﬁne

Gt(X, X0, R) = B(X),

i.e. Gt(X, X0, R) is the canonical precontact algebra B(X) = (RC(X, X0), CX) of
the 2-precontact space X (see Deﬁnition 2.18(b) and recall that for every F1, F2 ∈
RC(X, X0),

F1CX F2 ⇐⇒ ((∃x1 ∈ F1 ∩ X0)(∃x2 ∈ F2 ∩ X0)(x1Rx2))).

Hence Gt(X, X0, R) ∈ |PCA|.

Let f ∈ PCS((X, X0, R), (Y, Y0, R′)). Deﬁne

Gt(f ) : Gt(Y, Y0, R′) −→ Gt(X, X0, R)

12

by the formula

(13)

Gt(f )(clY (F ′)) = clX(X0 ∩ f −1(F ′)), ∀F ′ ∈ CO(Y0).

Set ϕf = Gt(f ), X = (X, X0, R), Y = (Y, Y0, R′), C = CX and C ′ = CY . We will
show that ϕf is a Boolean homomorphism between the Boolean algebras RC(Y, Y0)
and RC(X, X0). Clearly, for every F ′ ∈ CO(Y0), we have that X0 ∩ f −1(F ′) =
(f |X0)−1(F ′) ∈ CO(X0). Hence ϕf (RC(Y, Y0)) ⊆ RC(X, X0). Obviously, ϕf (∅) = ∅
and ϕf (Y ) = X. Let F ′, G′ ∈ CO(Y0). Then ϕf (clY (F ′) + clY (G′)) = ϕf (clY (F ′ ∪
G′)) = clX(X0 ∩f −1(F ′ ∪G′)) = clX ((X0 ∩f −1(F ′))∪(X0 ∩f −1(G′))) = ϕf (clY (F ′))+
ϕf (clY (G′)). Also, using Lemma 2.12, we get that ϕf ((clY (F ′))∗) = ϕf (clY (Y0 \ F ′) =
clX (X0 ∩ f −1(Y0 \ F ′)) = clX(X0 ∩ (f −1(Y0) \ f −1(F ′))) = clX(X0 \ (X0 ∩ f −1(F ′))) =
(clX (X0 ∩ f −1(F ′)))∗ = (ϕf (clY (F ′))∗. So,

(14)

Gt(f ) is a Boolean homomorphism.

Let F ′, G′ ∈ CO(Y0) and ϕf (clY (F ′))Cϕf (clY (G′)). Then

clX (X0 ∩ f −1(F ′))CclX(X0 ∩ f −1(G′))

and thus there exist x ∈ X0 ∩ clX(X0 ∩ f −1(F ′))(= X0 ∩ f −1(F ′)) and y ∈ X0 ∩
clX (X0 ∩ f −1(G′))(= X0 ∩ f −1(G′)) such that xRy. Hence f (x)R′f (y). By Lemma
2.12, we get that F ′ = Y0 ∩ clY (F ′) and G′ = Y0 ∩ clY (G′). Since, obviously, f (x) ∈ F ′
and f (y) ∈ G′, we get that clY (F ′)C ′clY (G′). Thus ϕ is a PCA-morphism, i.e., Gt(f )
is well deﬁned.

Now we will show that Gt is a contravariant functor. Clearly, Gt(id(X,X0,R)) =

idGt(X,X0,R).

Let f ∈ PCS((X, X0, R), (Y, Y0, R′)) and g ∈ PCS((Y, Y0, R′), (Z, Z0, R′′)).
Then, for every F ∈ CO(Z0), Gt(g ◦ f )(clZ(F )) = clX(X0 ∩ (g ◦ f )−1(F )) = clX (X0 ∩
f −1(g−1(F ))) and (Gt(f ) ◦ Gt(g))(clZ(F )) = Gt(f )(clY (Y0 ∩ g−1(F ))) = clX(X0 ∩
f −1(Y0 ∩ g−1(F ))) = clX(X0 ∩ f −1(Y0) ∩ f −1(g−1(F ))) = clX (X0 ∩ f −1(g−1(F ))) =
Gt(g ◦ f )(clZ(F )). So, Gt is a contravariant functor.

For every precontact algebra B, set

Ga(B) = X(B),

where X(B) is the canonical 2-precontact space of the precontact algebra B (see
Deﬁnition 2.20). Then Proposition 2.21 implies that Ga(B) ∈ |PCS|.

Let B = (B, C), B ′ = (B ′, C ′) and ϕ ∈ PCA(B, B ′). Let Ga(B) = (X, X0, R)

and Ga(B ′) = (Y, Y0, R′). Then we deﬁne the map

Ga(ϕ) : Ga(B ′) −→ Ga(B)

by the formula

(15)

Ga(ϕ)(Γ) = ϕ−1(Γ), ∀Γ ∈ Y.

Set fϕ = Ga(ϕ). Since every grill of a Boolean algebra B ′ is a union of ultraﬁlters of
B ′, every union of ultraﬁlters of B ′ is a grill of B ′ (see, e.g., [13, Corollary 3.1]), and

13

the inverse image of an ultraﬁlter by a Boolean homomorphism between two Boolean
algebras is again an ultraﬁlter, we get that ∀Γ ∈ Y , fϕ(Γ) is a grill of B. We have
to show that fϕ(Γ) is a clan. Let a, b ∈ fϕ(Γ), i.e. a, b ∈ ϕ−1(Γ). Hence ϕ(a) ∈ Γ ∋
ϕ(b). Thus ϕ(a)(C ′)#ϕ(b), i.e. (ϕ(a)C ′ϕ(b)) ∨ (ϕ(b)C ′ϕ(a)) ∨ (ϕ(a).ϕ(b) 6= 0). Then
(aCb) ∨ (bCa) ∨ (a.b 6= 0). Therefore, aC #b. This shows that fϕ(Γ) is a clan, i.e.
fϕ : Y −→ X.

We will show that fϕ is a continuous function. Let a ∈ B. Then gB(a) = {Γ ∈

X | a ∈ Γ} is a basic closed subset of X (see Deﬁnition 2.20). We will show that

(16)

f −1
ϕ (gB(a)) = gB ′(ϕ(a))(= {Γ′ ∈ Y | ϕ(a) ∈ Γ′}).

ϕ (gB(a)). Then fϕ(Γ′) ∈ gB(a). Thus a ∈ ϕ−1(Γ′), i.e. ϕ(a) ∈ Γ′.
ϕ (gB(a)) ⊆ gB ′(ϕ(a)). Conversely, let Γ′ ∈ gB ′(ϕ(a)), i.e.
ϕ (gB(a)).
ϕ (gB(a)) ⊇ gB ′(ϕ(a)). Thus the equation (16) is veriﬁed and we get that fϕ is

Indeed, let Γ′ ∈ f −1
So, Γ′ ∈ gB ′(ϕ(a)). Hence f −1
ϕ(a) ∈ Γ′. Then a ∈ ϕ−1(Γ′) = fϕ(Γ′). Hence fϕ(Γ′) ∈ gB(a). Then Γ′ ∈ f −1
So, f −1
a continuous function.

Let us now show that fϕ(Y0) ⊆ X0. Let u′ ∈ Y0. Then u′ ∈ U lt(B). Hence

fϕ(u′) = ϕ−1(u′) ∈ U lt(A) = X0. Therefore, fϕ(Y0) ⊆ X0.

Let x, y ∈ Y0 and xR′y. Then x, y ∈ U lt(B ′). Hence fϕ(x), fϕ(y) ∈ U lt(B).
We will show that fϕ(x)Rfϕ(y). We have that fϕ(x)Rfϕ(y) ⇐⇒ fϕ(x) × fϕ(y) ⊆
C ⇐⇒ (∀a ∈ ϕ−1(x))(∀b ∈ ϕ−1(y))(aCb). Now, since xR′y, we have that x×y ⊆ C ′,
i.e. (∀a ∈ x)(∀b ∈ y)(aC ′b). Thus, if a ∈ ϕ−1(x) and b ∈ ϕ−1(y), then ϕ(a) ∈ x and
ϕ(b) ∈ y; hence ϕ(a)C ′ϕ(b) and, therefore, aCb. This shows that fϕ(x)Rfϕ(y). So,

Ga(ϕ) ∈ PCS(Ga(B ′), Ga(B)).

Clearly, for every precontact algebra (B, C), Ga(id(B,C)) = idGa(B,C). Let ϕ ∈
PCA((B, C), (B1, C1)) and ψ ∈ PCA((B1, C1), (B2, C2)). Let fϕ = Ga(ϕ), fψ =
Ga(ψ) and Ga(B2, C2) = (Z, Z0, R). Then, for every Γ ∈ Z, we have that Ga(ψ ◦
ϕ)(Γ) = (ψ ◦ ϕ)−1(Γ) = ϕ−1(ψ−1(Γ)) = fϕ(fψ(Γ)) = (Ga(ϕ) ◦ Ga(ψ))(Γ). We get that
Ga is a contravariant functor.

Let X = (X, X0, R) ∈ |PCS|. We will ﬁx a PCS-isomorphism tX between X

and Ga(Gt(X). We have that Gt(X, X0, R) = B(X) = (RC(X, X0), CX). Set

B = (B, C) = (RC(X, X0), CX).

Let Ga(B) = (Y, Y0, R′). Then Y = Clans(B), Y0 = U lt(B) and, for every x, y ∈ Y0,
xR′y ⇐⇒ x × y ⊆ C. By [16, Proposition 4.7(a)] and Lemma 2.12, the contact
algebras

(17)

(CO(X0), (CR)#) and (RC(X, X0), C(X,X0)) are isomorphic.

Hence there exists a bijection between the sets

Clans(CO(X0), (CR)#) and Clans(RC(X, X0), C(X,X0)).

We have that for every F, G ∈ CO(X0),

F (CR)#G ⇐⇒ (F CRG) ∨ (GCRF ) ∨ (F.G 6= 0) ⇐⇒

14

⇐⇒ [(∃x ∈ F )(∃y ∈ G)(xRy)] ∨ [(∃y ∈ G)(∃x ∈ F )(yRx)] ∨ (F.G 6= 0) ⇐⇒

Hence the contact algebras

⇐⇒ clX (F )(CX)#clX(G).

(18)

(RC(X, X0), (CX)#),

(CO(X0), (CR)#) and (RC(X, X0), C(X,X0))

are isomorphic. In fact, the contact algebras

(19)

(RC(X, X0), (CX)#) and (RC(X, X0), C(X,X0)) coincide.

Therefore, the sets

Clans(RC(X, X0), CX)(= Y ) and Clans(RC(X, X0), C(X,X0))

coincide. By [13, Proposition 4.1(ii)], for every x ∈ X, σx ∈ Clans(RC(X), CX).
Hence, by Lemma 3.1, for every subalgebra A of the Boolean algebra RC(X),

(20)

σA
x ∈ Clans(A, CX ∩ A2).

Therefore, for every x ∈ X,

(21)

σRC(X,X0)
x

∈ Clans(RC(X, X0), C(X,X0)).

So, the following map is well-deﬁned:

(22)

tX : (X, X0, R) −→ Ga(Gt(X, X0, R))(= (Y, Y0, R′)), x 7→ σRC(X,X0)

x

;

we will show that it is a homeomorphism. We start by proving that tX is a surjection.
Let Γ ∈ Y . Then Γ ∈ Clans(B). From the above considerations, we get that
Γ′ = rX0,X(Γ) ∈ Clans(CO(X0), CR). Hence, by (PCS5), there exists x ∈ X such
that Γ′ = Γx,X0. Since, by Lemma 2.12, Γ = eX0,X(Γ′), we get that Γ = σB
x = tX (x).
So, tX is a surjection. For showing that tX is a injection, let x, y ∈ X and x 6= y.
Since X is a T0-space, there exists an open subset U of X such that |U ∩ {x, y}| = 1.
We can suppose, without loss of generality, that x ∈ U and y 6∈ U. Since B is a closed
base of X, there exists F ∈ B such that x ∈ X \ F ⊆ U. Then y ∈ F and x 6∈ F .
Hence F ∈ σB
x , i.e. tX (x) 6= tX (y). So, tX is an injection. Thus tX is a
bijection. We will now prove that tX is a continuous map. We have that the family
{gB(F ) = {Γ ∈ Y | F ∈ Γ} | F ∈ B} is a closed base of Y . Let F ∈ B. We will show
that

y and F 6∈ σB

(23)

t−1
X (gB(F )) = F.

Let x ∈ F . Set tX(x) = Γ. Then Γ = σB
Thus tX(F ) ⊆ gB(F ), i.e. F ⊆ t−1
Γ = tX (x). Then Γ ∈ gB(F ). Hence F ∈ Γ. Since Γ = σB
F ⊇ t−1
showing that t−1

x . Since F ∈ Γ, we get that Γ ∈ gB(F ).
X (gB(F )). Set
x , we get that x ∈ F . Hence
X (gB(F )). This shows that tX is a continuous map. For
X is a continuous map, let F ∈ B. Using (23) and the fact that tX is

X (gB(F )). Conversely, let x ∈ t−1

X (gB(F )). So, F = t−1

15

a bijection, we get that tX (F ) = gB(F ). Hence (t−1
t−1
X is a continuous map. So, tX is a homeomorphism.

X )−1(F ) = gB(F ). This shows that

We will now show that tX (X0) = Y0. Let x ∈ X0. Set Γ = tX (x). Then Γ = σB
x
and rX0,X(Γ) = {F ∈ CO(X0) | x ∈ F } = uX0
x ∈ U lt(CO(X0)). Then, by Lemma
2.12, Γ = eX0,X(uX0
x ) ∈ U lt(B) = Y0. Hence tX(X0) ⊆ Y0. Let now Γ ∈ Y0. Then
Γ ∈ U lt(B) and thus u = rX0,X(Γ) ∈ U lt(CO(X0)). Clearly, there exist x ∈ X0 such
that u = uX0
x = tX (x). Therefore, tX(X0) ⊇ Y0. We
have proved that tX (X0) = Y0.

x . Then Γ = eX0,X(uX0

x ) = σB

Finally, we will prove that for every x, y ∈ X0, xRy ⇐⇒ tX (x)R′tX (y). So, let

x, y ∈ X0 and xRy. Then tX (x) = σB

x and tX (y) = σB

y . We have that

tX (x)R′tX (y) ⇐⇒ σB

x × σB

y ⊆ CX ⇐⇒ [((x ∈ F ∈ B) ∧ (y ∈ G ∈ B)) ⇒ (F CXG)].

let x, y ∈ X0 and
This shows that, since xRy, tX (x)R′tX(y) holds. Conversely,
tX (x)R′tX (y). Suppose that x(−R)y. Then there exist F, G ∈ CO(X0) such that
x ∈ F , y ∈ G and R ∩ (F × G) = ∅. This implies that clX(F )(−CX)clX (G), a
contradiction. Hence, xRy.

All this shows that

(24)

tX is a PCS-isomorphism.

Let B = (B, C) be a precontact algebra and let us set (X, X0, R) = Ga(B).
Then Gt(X, X0, R) = (RC(X, X0), CX) and, using Theorem 2.22(a), we get that the
map

gB : B −→ Gt(Ga(B))(= (RC(X, X0), CX)), a 7→ gB(a) = {Γ ∈ X | a ∈ Γ},

is a PCA-isomorphism. This implies immediately that gB is also a PCA-isomorphism.

We will now show that

t : IdPCS −→ Ga ◦ Gt,

deﬁned by t(X) = tX, ∀X ∈ |PCS|, is a natural isomorphism.

Let X = (X, X0, R), Y = (Y, Y0, R′), X, Y ∈ |PCS|, f ∈ PCS(X, Y ) and

ˆf = Ga(Gt(f )). We will show that

(25)

ˆf ◦ tX = tY ◦ f.

Set ϕf = Gt(f ), A = RC(X, X0), B = RC(Y, Y0), B = Gt(Y )(= (B, CY )). Let
x ∈ X. Then

(tY ◦ f )(x) = tY (f (x)) = σB

f (x) = {F ∈ B | f (x) ∈ B}.

Further, ˆf (tX(x)) = ˆf (σA
x ). Then Γ′ = {G ∈
x } = {clY (G0) | G0 ∈ CO(Y0), x ∈ clX(X0 ∩ f −1(G0))}. Let
B | ϕf (G) ∈ σA
G0 ∈ CO(Y0) and clY (G0) ∈ Γ′. Then x ∈ clX(X0 ∩ f −1(G0)) and thus f (x) ∈
f (clX(X0 ∩ f −1(G0)) ⊆ clY (f (X0 ∩ f −1(G0))) ⊆ clY (G0). Therefore,

x ). Set Γ′ = ϕ−1

f (σA

x ) = ϕ−1

f (σA

Γ′ ⊆ σB

f (x).

16

We have that Γ′ ∈ Clans(B) = Clans(RC(Y, Y0), C(Y,Y0)). Hence Γ′
Clans(CO(Y0), CR′). Thus, by (PCS5), there exists y ∈ Y such that Γ′
Then

r = rY0,Y (Γ′) ∈
r = Γy,Y0.

(26)

Γ′ = σB
y .
f (x) and Γ′ is a grill, we get, by Lemma 3.2, that νB

Since Γ′ ⊆ σB
to [13, Proposition 4.1], νB
ultraﬁlter u of B such that νB
Lemma 3.2 implies that νB
every F ′ ∈ νB
Hence intY (F ′ ∩ G′) 6= ∅ and thus intY (F ′) ∩ intY (G′) 6= ∅, for every F ′ ∈ νB
every G′ ∈ νB
Therefore Γ′ = σB

f (x) ⊆ Γ′. According
f (x) is a ﬁlter of B. Hence, by Lemma 2.16, there exists an
y and since u is a grill of B,
f (x) ∪ νB
y ⊆ u ⊆ Γ′. Then, for
y , we have that F ′.G′ 6= 0, i.e. clY (intY (F ′∩G′)) 6= ∅.
f (x) and
y . Since Y is a T0-space, using [16, Lemma 8.14], we get that y = f (x).

f (x) ⊆ u ⊆ Γ′. Then u ⊆ σB
y ⊆ u. So, we obtained that νB

f (x) and every G′ ∈ νB

f (x). Thus ˆf ◦ tX = tY ◦ f and hence t is a natural isomorphism.

Finally, we will prove that

g : IdPCA −→ Gt ◦ Ga, where g(B) = gB, ∀B ∈ |PCA|,

is a natural isomorphism.

Let A = (A, C), B = (B, C ′), A, B ∈ |PCA|, ϕ ∈ PCA(A, B) and ˆϕ =
Gt(Ga(ϕ)). We have to prove that gB ◦ϕ = ˆϕ◦gA. Set f = Ga(ϕ), (X, X0, R) = Ga(A)
and (Y, Y0, R′) = Ga(B). Then ˆϕ = Gt(f )(= ϕf ). Let a ∈ A. Then gB(ϕ(a)) = {Γ′ ∈
Y | ϕ(a) ∈ Γ′}. Further, using Lemma 2.12, we get that

gB(ϕ(a)) = clY (sB(ϕ(a)))

and gA(a) = clX(sA(a))

(see (5) for the notation sA). Thus

ˆϕ(gA(a)) = clY (Y0 ∩ f −1(sA(a))).

Let u′ ∈ Y0 ∩ f −1(sA(a)). Then u′ ∈ U lt(B) and f (u′) ∈ sA(a). Hence ϕ−1(u′) ∈
sA(a) = {u ∈ U lt(A) | a ∈ u}. Thus a ∈ ϕ−1(u′), i.e. ϕ(a) ∈ u′. Therefore
u′ ∈ sB(ϕ(a)). So, Y0 ∩ f −1(sA(a)) ⊆ sB(ϕ(a)). Conversely, let u′ ∈ sB(ϕ(a)).
Then u′ ∈ Y0 and ϕ(a) ∈ u′. Hence a ∈ ϕ−1(u′) = f (u′). Thus f (u′) ∈ sA(a).
Therefore, u′ ∈ Y0 ∩ f −1(sA(a)). So, Y0 ∩ f −1(sA(a)) ⊇ sB(ϕ(a)) and we get that
Y0 ∩ f −1(sA(a)) = sB(ϕ(a)). Hence ˆϕ(gA(a)) = clY (sB(ϕ(a))) = gB(ϕ(a)). So, g is a
natural isomorphism.

We have proved that (Gt, Ga, g, t) is a duality between the categories PCS and

PCA.

In the proof of the next corollary (as well as in the proofs of all further corollaries

of Theorem 3.4), we will use the notation from (the proof of) Theorem 3.4.

Corollary 3.5. Let X = (X, X0, R), Y = (Y, Y0, R′) and f ∈ PCS(X, Y ). Then,
for every H ∈ RC(Y, Y0),

(27)

Gt(f )(H) = f −1(H)

(see (13) for the notation Gt).

17

Proof. Recall that RC(Y, Y0) = {clY (F ) | F ∈ CO(Y0)}. Let now H ∈ RC(Y, Y0)
and ˆf = Ga(Gt(f )). Then, by (25), ˆf ◦ tX = tY ◦ f . Thus,

f −1(H) = (tX)−1( ˆf −1(tY (H))).

Let B = Gt(X), B ′ = Gt(Y ) and ϕ = Gt(f ). Using (24), (23) and (16), we get that
tY (H) = gB ′(H) (see (11) for the notation gB ′(H)), ˆf −1(tY (H)) = ˆf −1(gB ′(H)) =
gB(ϕ(H)) and (tX )−1( ˆf −1(tY (H))) = (tX )−1(gB(ϕ(H))) = ϕ(H). Hence, f −1(H) =
Gt(f )(H).

As it was already noted, Theorem 3.4 implies the Stone Duality Theorem [27, 24]

and its connected version [16].

Corollary 3.6. ([27, 24]) The category Bool and the category Stone of compact
zero-dimensional Hausdorﬀ spaces and continuous maps are dually equivalent.

Proof. Let B be the full subcategory of the category PCA having as objects all
(pre)contact algebras of the form (B, ρB
s ). It is
easy to see that if A and B are Boolean algebras, then a function ϕ : A −→ B induces
a PCA-morphism between (A, ρA
s ) iﬀ ϕ is a Boolean homomorphism.
Hence the categories Bool and B are isomorphic.

s ) (see Example 2.4 for the notation ρB

s ) and (B, ρB

Let S be the full subcategory of the category PCS having as objects all 2-
precontact spaces of the form (X, X, DX ), where DX is the diagonal of X. Obviously,
if (X, X, DX) ∈ |S| then X is a Stone space. Conversely, it is easy to see that every
triple of the form (X, X, DX ), where X is a Stone space, is a 2-precontact space.
Thus the objects of the category S are all triples of the form (X, X, DX ), where X
is a Stone space. Clearly, if X, Y ∈ |Stone|, then a function f : X −→ Y induces a
PCS-morphism between (X, X, DX ) and (Y, Y, DY ) iﬀ f is a continuous map. Hence
the categories S and Stone are isomorphic.

s ) is a 2-precontact space. Hence Ga(B, ρB

We will now show that Ga(B) ⊆ S and Gt(S) ⊆ B. Indeed, if B is a Boolean
s ) = (Clans(B, ρB
algebra, then Ga(B, ρB
s ), U lt(B), R), where, for every u, v ∈ U lt(B),
uRv ⇐⇒ u × v ⊆ ρB
s . Obviously, we have that for every u, v ∈ U lt(B), uRv ⇐⇒
u = v. Further, by [13, Example 3.1], Clans(B, ρB
s ) = U lt(B). Also, by Theorem
3.4, Ga(B, ρB
s ) = (X, X, DX ), where X ∈
|Stone|. So, Ga(B) ⊆ S. Let now X ∈ |Stone| and X = (X, X, DX ). Then Gt(X) =
(RC(X, X), CX). We have that RC(X, X) = CO(X) and for every F, G ∈ CO(X),
F CXG ⇐⇒ [(∃x ∈ F )(∃y ∈ G)(xDX y)] ⇐⇒ F ∩ G 6= ∅ ⇐⇒ F.G 6= 0 ⇐⇒
F ρCO(X)
G. Thus Gt(X) ∈ |S|. So, we get that Gt(S) ⊆ B. Therefore we obtain,
using Theorem 3.4, that the restriction of the contravariant functor Ga to the category
B is a duality between the categories B and S. This implies that the categories Bool
and Stone are dually equivalent.

s

Now we will obtain as a corollary of Theorem 3.4 the connected version of the

Stone Duality Theorem proved in [16].

Corollary 3.7. ([16]) The categories Bool and 2Stone are dually equivalent.

18

Proof. Let B ′ be the full subcategory of the category PCA having as objects all
(pre)contact algebras of the form (B, ρB
l ). It is
easy to see that if A and B are Boolean algebras, then a function ϕ : A −→ B induces
a PCA-morphism between (A, ρA
l ) iﬀ ϕ is a Boolean homomorphism.
Hence the categories Bool and B ′ are isomorphic.

l ) (see Example 2.4 for the notation ρB

l ) and (B, ρB

Let S′ be the full subcategory of the category PCS having as objects all 2-
precontact spaces of the form (X, X0, (X0)2). We will show that if (X, X0, (X0)2) ∈
Indeed, set B = CO(X0) and R = (X0)2.
|S′| then (X, X0) is a Stone 2-space.
Then, for every F, G ∈ B, we have that F CRG ⇐⇒ [(∃x ∈ F )(∃y ∈ G)((x, y) ∈
R)] ⇐⇒ [(F 6= ∅) ∧ (G 6= ∅)] ⇐⇒ F ρB
l G. Thus, using [13, Example 3.1], we get
that Clans(B, CR) = Clans(B, ρB
l ) = Grills(B). Now it becomes obvious that the
axiom (S2S4) is fulﬁlled because the axiom (PCS5) is fulﬁlled. The rest is clear, so
that (X, X0) is a Stone 2-space. Arguing similarly, we get that, conversely, if (X, X0)
is a Stone 2-space then (X, X0, (X0)2) is a 2-precontact space. Hence, the objects
of the category S′ are all triples (X, X0, (X0)2), where (X, X0) is a Stone 2-space
(i.e., (X, X0) ∈ |2Stone|). Clearly, if (X, X0), (Y, Y0) ∈ |2Stone|, then a function
f : X −→ Y induces a PCS-morphism between (X, X0, X 2
0 ) ⇐⇒ (f
is a continuous map and f (X0) ⊆ Y0) ⇐⇒ (f ∈ 2Stone((X, X0), (Y, Y0))). Hence
the categories S′ and 2Stone are isomorphic.

0 ) and (Y, Y0, Y 2

l ) is a 2-precontact space. Hence Ga(B, ρB

We will now show that Ga(B ′) ⊆ S′ and Gt(S′) ⊆ B ′. Indeed, if B is a Boolean
l ) = (Clans(B, ρB
algebra, then Ga(B, ρB
l ), U lt(B), R), where, for every u, v ∈ U lt(B),
uRv ⇐⇒ u × v ⊆ ρB
l . Since the ultraﬁlters do not contain the zero element, we
get that uRv for every u, v ∈ U lt(B), i.e. R = (U lt(B))2. Also, by Theorem 3.4,
l ) ∈ |S′|. So, Ga(B ′) ⊆ S′. Let
Ga(B, ρB
now (X, X0) ∈ |2Stone| and X = (X, X0, X 2
0 ). Then Gt(X) = (RC(X, X0), CX).
We have that for every F, G ∈ CO(X0), (clX(F )CXclX (G)) ⇐⇒ [(∃x ∈ F )(∃y ∈
G)((x, y) ∈ X 2
clX (G)). Thus
Gt(X) ∈ |S′|. So, we get that Gt(S′) ⊆ B ′. Therefore we obtain, using Theorem 3.4,
that the restriction of the contravariant functor Ga to the category B ′ is a duality
between the categories B ′ and S′. This implies that the categories Bool and 2Stone
are dually equivalent.

Recall that: (a)([13]) if (B, C) is a contact algebra, then a non-empty set U
of ultraﬁlters of B is called a clique in (B, C) if for any two u, v ∈ U we have that
u × v ⊆ C; (b)([13]) a subset of B is a clan in (B, C) iﬀ it is a union of the elements
of a clique in (B, C).

Corollary 3.8. Let X = (X, X0, R1), Y = (Y, Y0, R2) and X, Y ∈ |PCS|. If f, g ∈
PCS(X, Y ) and f |X0 = g|X0 then f = g.

Proof. Let B = RC(X, X0), B ′ = RC(Y, Y0) and

Ga(Gt(X)) = (X ′, X ′

0, R′

1), Ga(Gt(Y )) = (Y ′, Y ′

0, R′

2).

Let f ′ = Ga(Gt(f )). Then, by Theorem 3.4, we have that tY ◦ f = f ′ ◦ tX , i.e.

f ′(σB

x ) = σB ′

f (x).

19

Let x ∈ X \ X0. Then tX(x) = σB

Hence it is a union of the elements of a clique {σB
Let Γ′ = {clY (G′) | G′ ∈ CO(Y0), f (xα) ∈ G′ for some α ∈ A}. We will show that

x is a clan in (B, (CX)#) (see (21) and (19)).
xα | xα ∈ X0, α ∈ A} in (B, (CX)#).

(28)

σB ′
f (x) = Γ′.

f (x). Therefore Γ′ ⊆ σB ′

xα) and vα = tY (f (xα))(= σB ′

Indeed, let G′ ∈ CO(Y0) and f (xα) ∈ G′ for some α ∈ A. Set G = (f |X0)−1(G′).
Then xα ∈ G ∈ CO(X0). Thus x ∈ clX(G). Since f is a continuous function, we
get that f (x) ∈ clY (f (G)) ⊆ clY (G′). Thus clY (G′) ∈ σB ′
f (x).
Set, for every α ∈ A, uα = tX (xα)(= σB
f (xα)). Obviously,
each uα is an ultraﬁlter of B. Since f (X0) ⊆ Y0, we obtain that each vα is an
ultraﬁlter of B ′. Also, uα × uβ ⊆ (CX)# for all α, β ∈ A, i.e. uαR′
1uβ for all
α, β ∈ A. Since tX is a PCS-isomorphism, we get that xαR1xβ for all α, β ∈ A.
Then f (xα)R2f (xβ) for all α, β ∈ A, and thus tY (f (xα))R′
2tY (f (xβ)) for all α, β ∈ A.
This means that va × vβ ⊆ (CY )# for all α, β ∈ A, and, hence, {vα | α ∈ A} is a
clique in (B ′, (CY )#). Thus Γ′ is a clan in (B ′, (CY )#), i.e. Γ′ ∈ Y ′. Then there
exists y ∈ Y such that Γ′ = tY (y), i.e. Γ′ = σB ′
y . Now we show that y = f (x)
exactly as in the paragraph immediately after (26). So, (28) is proved. Analogously
we get that σB ′
for some α ∈ A}. Let
g ′ = Ga(Gt(g)). Then Theorem 3.4 implies that g ′(σB
g(x). Since f |X0 = g|X0,
we get that f ′(σB

g(x) = {clY (G′) | G′ ∈ CO(Y0), g(xα) ∈ G′

x ) = g ′(σB

x ). Then f (x) = g(x). So, f = g.

x ) = σB ′

Corollary 3.9. The category PCS is equivalent to the category SAS of all Stone
adjacency spaces and all continuous maps f : (X0, R) −→ (X ′
0, R′) between them such
that, for every x, y ∈ X0, xRy implies f (x)R′f (y).

Proof. Let F t : PCS −→ SAS be the functor deﬁned by

F t(X, X0, R) = (X0, R)

on the objects of the category PCS, and by

F t(f ) = f |X0

for every f ∈ PCS((X, X0, R), (Y, Y0, R′)). Clearly, F t is a functor. We will show
that it is full, faithful and isomorphism-dense, i.e. that it is an equivalence functor.
Let (X0, R) ∈ |SAS|. Set B = (CO(X0), CR) and X = Ga(B). According to
Theorem 3.4, X ∈ |PCS|. Let X = (X ′, X ′
0, R′) and B = CO(X0). Then, by the
Stone duality theorem, f : X0 −→ X ′
0, x 7→ ux, is a homeomorphism (recall that ux =
{P ∈ B | x ∈ P }). We will show that for every x, y ∈ X0, xRy ⇐⇒ f (x)R′f (y).
Indeed, let x, y ∈ X0 and xRy. We have that f (x)R′f (y) ⇐⇒ uxR′uy ⇐⇒
ux × uy ⊆ CR ⇐⇒ [(∀P ∈ ux)(∀Q ∈ uy)(P CRQ)] ⇐⇒ ([(x ∈ P ∈ B) ∧ (y ∈ Q ∈
B)] ⇒ (R ∩ (P × Q) 6= ∅)). Now, since xRy, we obtain that f (x)R′f (y). Conversely,
let x, y ∈ X0 and f (x)R′f (y). Suppose that x(−R)y. Since R is a closed relation,
there exist P, Q ∈ B such that x ∈ P , y ∈ Q and R ∩ (P × Q) = ∅. We get that
f (x)(−R′)f (y), a contradiction. Hence, xRy. Therefore, f is a SAS-isomorphism

between (X0, R) and (X ′

0, R′). Since F t(X) = F t(X ′, X ′

0, R′) = (X ′

0, R′), we obtain

Clearly, Corollary 3.8 implies that F t is a faithful functor.
Let X = (X, X0, R0), Y = (Y, Y0, R1) and X, Y ∈ |PCS|. We will show
that the restriction of F t to the hom-set PCS(X, Y ) is a surjection (i.e., the cor-
respondence PCS(X, Y ) −→ SAS(F t(X), F t(Y )), f 7→ f |X0, is a surjection). Let
g ∈ SAS((X0, R0), (Y0, R1)) and ϕ = St(g) : CO(Y0) −→ CO(X0), G 7→ g−1(G),
where St : Stone −→ Bool is the Stone duality functor. In fact,

ϕ ∈ PCA((CO(Y0), CR1), (CO(X0), CR0)).

Indeed, let G1, G2 ∈ CO(Y0) and ϕ(G1)CR0ϕ(G2). Then there exist x ∈ ϕ(G1) and
y ∈ ϕ(G2) such that xR0y. We get that x ∈ g−1(G1), y ∈ g−1(G2) and xR0y.
Thus g(x) ∈ G1, g(y) ∈ g(G2) and g(x)R1g(y). Hence, G1CR1G2. So, ϕ is a PCA-
morphism. Then Theorem 3.4 implies that

Ga(ϕ) ∈ PCS(Ga(CO(X0), CR0), Ga(CO(Y0), CR1)).

0 = S(St(X0)) and Y ′

0) and Ga((CO(Y0), CR1) = (Y ′, Y ′

Let Ga(CO(X0), CR0) = (X ′, X ′
1). Then
0 = S(St(Y0)), where S : Bool −→ Stone is the Stone du-
X ′
ality functor. Thus fX0 : X0 −→ X ′
0 , y 7→ uy, are
homeomorphisms and fY0 ◦ g = S(St(g)) ◦ fX0. Let g ′ = S(St(g)). Then we get that
ug(x) = g ′(ux), for every x ∈ X0. We will show that g ′ = (Ga(ϕ))|X ′
0. Indeed, for every
x ∈ X0, we have that (Ga(ϕ))(ux) = ϕ−1(ux) = {G ∈ CO(Y0) | ϕ(G) ∈ ux} = {G ∈
CO(Y0) | x ∈ ϕ(G)} = {G ∈ CO(Y0) | x ∈ g−1(G)} = {G ∈ CO(Y0) | g(x) ∈ G} =
ug(x) = g ′(ux). Hence, F t(Ga(ϕ)) = g ′. Since (CO(X0), CR0) and (RC(X, X0), CX)
are PCA-isomorphic and, analogously, (CO(Y0), CR1) and (RC(Y, Y0), CY ) are PCA-
isomorphic, we get that Ga(CO(X0), CR0) is PCS-isomorphic to Ga(Gt(X)) and,
analogously, Ga(CO(Y0), CR1) is PCS-isomorphic to Ga(Gt(Y )). Now, using Theo-
rem 3.4, we obtain that there exists g1 ∈ PCS(X, Y ) such that F t(g1) = g. Thus,
the functor F t is full.

All this shows that F t : PCS −→ SAS is an equivalence functor.

Corollary 3.10. ([3]) The categories PCA and SAS are dually equivalent.

Proof. Clearly, it follows from Theorem 3.4 and Corollary 3.9.

Remark 3.11. It is not diﬃcult to see that a direct proof of Corollary 3.10 can be
easily obtained using Theorem 2.11.

Note that Corollary 3.10 is formulated in [3] using the relation non-tangential
inclusion (deﬁned here in (1); see also Remark 2.3) instead of the precontact relation;
the relation non-tangential inclusion is called there subordination.

Corollary 3.12. For every Stone adjacency space (X0, R) there exists a unique (up to
homeomorphism) topological space X such that the triple (X, X0, R) is a 2-precontact
space (and, thus, X is a compact semiregular T0-space).

21

Proof. By Corollary 3.9, there exists an equivalence functor F s : SAS −→ PCS
such that the compositions F t ◦ F s and F s ◦ F t are naturally isomorphic to the
corresponding identity functors. Let (X0, R) ∈ |SAS|. Since F t is isomorphism-
dense, there exists (X ′, X ′
0, R′) is SAS-isomorphic
to (X0, R). Then, clearly, there exists X = (X, X0, R) ∈ |PCS|. Suppose that there
exists X 1 = (X1, X0, R) ∈ |PCS|. Then F s(F t(X)) = F s(F t(X 1)) and thus X is
PCS-isomorphic to X 1. This implies that X is homeomorphic to X1. Note that, by
Deﬁnition 2.18 and Corollary 2.23, X is a compact semiregular T0-space.

0, R′) ∈ |PCS| such that F t(X ′, X ′

Corollary 3.13. (A Duality Theorem for Contact Algebras) The full sub-
category CA of the category PCA whose objects are all contact algebras is du-
ally equivalent to the category CS of all 2-contact spaces and all continuous maps
f : (X, X0) −→ (X ′, X ′

0) between them such that f (X0) ⊆ X ′
0.

Proof. Let S′′ be the full subcategory of the category PCS whose objects are all 2-
precontact spaces (X, X0, R) for which R is a reﬂexive and symmetric relation. Then
the categories S ′′ and CS are isomorphic. Indeed, let F c : S′′ −→ CS be deﬁned
by F c(X, X0, R) = (X, X0) on the objects of the category S′′, and by F c(f ) = f
on the morphisms of the the category S′′. Then, using [16, Proposition 7.7], we
get that F c is well-deﬁned and, obviously,
it is a functor. By [16, Lemma 7.5],
for every (X, X0) ∈ |CS| there exists a unique relation R(X,X0) on X0 such that
(X, X0, R) ∈ |S′′|; as it is shown in [16, Lemma 7.5], the relation R(X,X0) is deﬁned as
follows: for every x, y ∈ X0,

(29)

xR(X,X0)y ⇐⇒ ((∀F ∈ ux)(∀G ∈ uy)(clX(F ) ∩ clX(G) 6= ∅)),

where ux = {A ∈ CO(X0) | x ∈ A} and analogously for uy (see (7)). Now we
set F d(X, X0) = (X, X0, R(X,X0)), for every (X, X0) ∈ |CS|. Also, for every f ∈
CS((X, X0), (Y, Y0)), we set F d(f ) = f . Then f ∈ S′′(F d(X, X0), F d(Y, Y0)). Indeed,
set R = R(X,X0) and R′ = R(Y,Y0). Let x, y ∈ X0 and xRy. Then f (x), f (y) ∈ Y0 (since
f (X0) ⊆ Y0). Suppose that f (x)(−R′)f (y). Then there exist F ′ ∈ uf (x) and G′ ∈ uf (y)
such that clY (F ′) ∩ clY (G′) = ∅. Let F = X0 ∩ f −1(F ′) and G = X0 ∩ f −1(G′). Then
F ∈ ux and G ∈ uy. Thus there exists z ∈ clX(F ) ∩ clX (G). Since f is a continuous
function, we get that f (z) ∈ f (clX (F )) ⊆ clY (f (F )) ⊆ clY (F ′) and, analogously,
f (z) ∈ clY (G′). Therefore, clY (F ′) ∩ clY (G′) 6= ∅, a contradiction. Hence f (x)R′f (y).
So, f ∈ S′′(F d(X, X0), F d(Y, Y0)). All this shows that we have deﬁned a functor
F d : CS −→ S′′. Clearly, F c ◦ F d = IdCS and F d ◦ F c = IdS′′. Hence the categories
S′′ and CS are isomorphic.

We will now show that Ga(CA) ⊆ S′′ and Gt(S′′) ⊆ CA. The ﬁrst inclusion
follows from [16, Lemma 3.5(d,e)], and the second one follows from Proposition 2.5(b)
since, for every X = (X, X0, R) ∈ |PCS|, the precontact algebras (RC(X, X0), CX)
and (CO(X0), CR) are isomorphic. Now, applying Theorem 3.4, we obtain that the
categories CA and CS are dually equivalent.

Corollary 3.14. Let f ∈ CS((X, X0), (Y, Y0)). Then, for every H ∈ RC(Y, Y0),

(30)

f −1(H) = clX(X0 ∩ f −1(H)).

22

It follows from Corollary 3.13, Corollary 3.5 and the obvious fact that that

Proof.
X0 ∩ f −1(H) = X0 ∩ f −1(H ∩ Y0) (because f (X0) ⊆ Y0).

The next corollary follows immediately from Corollary 3.10 and Proposition 2.5:

Corollary 3.15. ([3]) The category CA is dually equivalent to the full subcategory
CSAS of the category SAS whose objects are all Stone adjacency spaces (X, R) such
that R is a reﬂexive and symmetric relation.

Let us derive it from Corollary 3.13 as well. Indeed, by the proof of Corollary
3.13, the categories S′′ and CA are dually equivalent; by Corollary 3.9, the functor
F t : PCS −→ SAS is an equivalence; obviously, F t(S′′) = CSAS and hence the
categories S′′ and CSAS are equivalent; therefore, the categories CSAS and CA are
dually equivalent.

Corollary 3.16. (A Duality Theorem for Complete Contact Algebras)
The full subcategory CCA of the category PCA whose objects are all complete
contact algebras is dually equivalent to the category CSRS of all C-semiregular spaces
and all continuous maps between them which preserve u-points.

Proof. Let S′′′ be the full subcategory of the category PCS whose objects are all
2-precontact spaces (X, X0, R) for which R is a reﬂexive and symmetric relation and
X0 is extremally disconnected. Then the categories S ′′′ and CSRS are isomorphic.
Indeed, let F e : S′′′ −→ CSRS be deﬁned by F e(X, X0, R) = X on the objects of
the category S′′′, and by F e(f ) = f on the morphisms of the the category S′′′. Then,
by [16, Proposition 7.7] and Lemma 2.33, F e is well-deﬁned on the objects of the
category S ′′′. Let X = (X, X0, R) ∈ |S′′′|, Y = (Y, Y0, R′) ∈ |S′′′| and f ∈ S′′′(X, Y ).
We will show that F e(f ) ∈ CSRS(F e(X), F e(Y )). We have, by [16, Proposition
7.7], Lemma 2.33 and Theorem 2.32, that X0 = {x ∈ X | x is an u-point of X} and
Y0 = {y ∈ Y | y is an u-point of Y }. Since f is a continuous map and f (X0) ⊆ Y0,
we get that f is a CSRS-morphism. So, F e is well-deﬁned. Obviously, F e is a
functor. Let now X ∈ |CSRS|. We set F f (X) = (X, X0, R(X,X0)), where X0 =
{x ∈ X | x is an u-point of X} and the relation R(X,X0) on X0 is deﬁned by (29).
Then, using Theorem 2.32 and the proof of Corollary 3.13, we get that F f (X) ∈ |S′′′|.
Further, for every f ∈ CSRS(X, Y ), we set F f (f ) = f . Let F f (X) = (X, X0, R(X,X0))
and F f (Y ) = (Y, Y0, R(Y,Y0)). Then, clearly, f (X0) ⊆ Y0 and since, by Theorem 2.32,
(X, X0) and (Y, Y0) are 2-contact spaces, we obtain that f ∈ CS((X, X0), (Y, Y0));
now, by Corollary 3.13, f = F d(f ) and we get that f ∈ S′′(F d(X, X0), F d(Y, Y0)); this
implies that f ∈ S′′′(F f (X), F f (Y )). All this shows that we have deﬁned a functor
F f : CSRS −→ S′′′. Clearly, F e ◦ F f = IdCSRS and F f ◦ F e = IdS′′′. Hence the
categories S′′′ and CSRS are isomorphic.

We will now show that Ga(CCA) ⊆ S′′′ and Gt(S′′′) ⊆ CCA. By Corollary
3.13, we have that Ga(CCA) ⊆ S′′ and then Theorem 2.22(a) together with Lemma
2.14 imply that even Ga(CCA) ⊆ S′′′. Further, by Corollary 3.13, Gt(S′′) ⊆ CA.
Since, for every X = (X, X0, R) ∈ |S′′′|, we have that CO(X0) = RC(X0) and thus
RC(X, X0) = RC(X), we obtain that Gt(S′′′) ⊆ CCA. Now, applying Theorem 3.4,
we obtain that the categories CCA and CSRS are dually equivalent.

23

We are now going to present Corollary 3.13 in a form similar to that of Corollary
3.16. For doing this we need to recall two deﬁnitions from [23]. We ﬁrst introduce a
new notion.

Deﬁnition 3.17. Let X be a topological space and B be a Boolean subalgebra of
the Boolean algebra RC(X). Then the pair (X, B) is called a mereotopological pair.

Deﬁnition 3.18. ([23]) (a) A mereotopological pair (X, B) is called a mereotopo-
logical space if B is a closed base for X. We say that (X, B) is a mereotopological
T0-space if (X, B) is a mereotopological space and X is a T0-space.
(b) A mereotopological space (X, B) is said to be mereocompact if for every clan Γ of
(B, CX ∩ B2) there exists a point x of X such that Γ = σB

x (see (9) for σB

x ).

Remark 3.19. (a) Obviously, if (X, B) is a mereotopological space then X is semireg-
ular.
(b) The deﬁnition of mereocompactness given here is one of the several equivalent
expressions of the deﬁnition of mereocompactness given in [23]. We will use only the
deﬁnition given here.
(c) Clearly, a space X is C-semiregular (see Deﬁnition 2.29) iﬀ (X, RC(X)) is a
mereocompact T0-space. So that, the notion of mereocompactness is an analogue of
the notion of C-semiregular space.

Having in mind the deﬁnition of an u-point of a topological space (see Deﬁnition
2.31), we will now introduce the more general notion of an u-point of a mereotopolog-
ical pair.

Deﬁnition 3.20. Let (X, B) be a mereotopological pair and x ∈ X. Then the point
x is said to be an u-point of the mereotopological pair (X, B) if, for every F, G ∈ B,
x ∈ F ∩ G implies that x ∈ clX (intX(F ∩ G)).

Obviously, a point x of a topological space X is an u-point of X iﬀ it is an
u-point of the mereotopological pair (X, RC(X)). Also, if X is a topological space,
then every point of X is an u-point of the mereotopological pair (X, CO(X)).

We will now generalize some assertions from [16] concerning u-points.

Proposition 3.21. Let (X, X0) be a topological pair, (X, B) be a mereotopological
pair (resp., a mereotopological space) and B0 = {F ∩ X0 | F ∈ B}. Then (X0, B0) is
a mereotopological pair (resp., a mereotopological space); also, for every x ∈ X0, we
have that x is an u-point of (X0, B0) iﬀ x is an u-point of (X, B).

Proof. Using Lemma 2.12, we get that (X0, B0) is a mereotopological pair (resp., a
mereotopological space). Note that, by Lemma 2.12, for every H ∈ B there exist
H0 ∈ B0 such that H = clX (H0) and, also, for every H0 ∈ B0, clX (H0) ∈ B.
Let x ∈ X0 be an u-point of (X0, B0), F, G ∈ B0 and x ∈ clX(F ) ∩ clX(G). Then
x ∈ F ∩G and hence x ∈ clX0(intX0(F ∩G)). Since, by Lemma 2.12, clX (clX0(intX0(F ∩
G))) = clX (intX (clX(F ) ∩ clX (G))), we get that x is an u-point of (X, B). Conversely,
let x ∈ X0 be an u-point of (X, B). Let F, G ∈ B0 and x ∈ F ∩ G. Then x ∈

24

clX (F ) ∩ clX(G) and thus x ∈ clX(intX(clX(F ) ∩ clX(G))). Since, by Lemma 2.12,
X ∩ clX(intX (clX (F ) ∩ clX(G))) = clX0(intX0(F ∩ G)), we get that x is an u-point of
(X0, B0).

Proposition 3.22. Let (X, B) be a topological pair and x ∈ X. Then x is an u-point
of (X, B) iﬀ σB

x is an ultraﬁlter of the Boolean algebra B.

Proof. Since, by (20), σB

x is an ultraﬁlter of B) ⇐⇒ [(∀F, G ∈ σB

x is a clan of (B, CX ∩ B2), we obtain that σB

Theorem 3.23. For every mereocompact T0-space (X, B), the set

u(X, B) = {x ∈ X | x is an u-point of (X, B)}

endowed with its subspace topology is a dense zero-dimensional compact Hausdorﬀ
subspace of X and is the unique dense zero-dimensional compact Hausdorﬀ subspace
of X such that RC(X, u(X, B)) = B. Also, the pair (X, u(X, B)) is a 2-contact space.

Proof. Set X0 = u(X, B). We have that B = (B, CX ∩ B2) is a contact algebra.
Hence, by Deﬁnition 2.25(c), X c(B) is a 2-contact space. Let X c(B) = (X ′, X ′
0).
Then X ′ = Clans(B) and X ′
0 = U lt(B). Since X is a T0-space and B is a closed base
for X, arguing as in the paragraph after (22) and using (20), we obtain that the map

X : X −→ X ′, x 7→ σB
tc
x ,

is an injection. Also, the fact that (X, B) is mereocompact implies that tc
X is a
surjection. Now, arguing as in the paragraph immediately after (23), we get that tc
X
is a homeomorphism and

(31)

∀F ∈ B, tc

X (F ) = gB(F ).

Using Proposition 3.22, we obtain that tc
0. All this shows that (X, X0)
is a 2-contact space. Hence, X0 is a Stone space and X0 is dense in X. Using
(31) and Theorem 2.22(a) (or [16, Theorem 7.9(a)]), we get that B = RC(X, X0) =

X (X0) = X ′

Note that Theorem 3.23 and Proposition 2.26 imply the following result from
[23]: if (X, B) is a mereocompact T0-space then X is compact. (In fact, a stronger
result is proved in [23]: every mereocompact space is compact.)

Lemma 3.24. If (X, X0) is a 2-contact space, then (X, RC(X, X0)) is a mereocom-
pact T0-space.

Proof. Clearly, the map eX0,X : (CO(X0), δ(X,X0)) −→ (RC(X, X0), F 7→ clX(F ), is
a CA-isomorphism (use Lemma 2.12) and for every x ∈ X, eX0,X(Γx,X0) = σB
x . Then
the axioms (CS1), (CS3) and (CS4) from Deﬁnition 2.25 imply that (X, RC(X, X0))
is a mereocompact T0-space.

Deﬁnition 3.25. Let us denote by MCS the category whose objects are all mere-
ocompact T0-spaces and whose morphisms are all continuous maps between mereo-
compact T0-spaces which preserve the corresponding u-points (i.e.,

f ∈ MCS((X, A), (Y, B))

iﬀ f : X −→ Y is a continuous map and, for every u-point x of (X, A), f (x) is an
u-point of (Y, B)).

Obviously, MCS is indeed a category.

Theorem 3.26. (A Duality Theorem for Contact Algebras) The categories
CA and MCS are dually equivalent.

Proof. Having in mind Corollary 3.13, it is enough to show that the categories CS
and MCS are isomorphic. Let F g : CS −→ MCS be deﬁned by F g(X, X0) =
(X, RC(X, X0)) on the objects of the category CS, and by F g(f ) = f on the mor-
phisms of the category CS. Then Lemma 3.24 shows that F g is well deﬁned on
the objects of the category CS. Let f ∈ CS((X, X0), (Y, Y0)). Then f : X −→ Y
is a continuous function and f (X0) ⊆ Y0. Since (X, X0) is a 2-contact space, we
get that X0 is a dense Stone subspace of X. Since (X, RC(X, X0)) is a mereocom-
pact T0-space and RC(X, X0) = {clX(P ) | P ∈ CO(X0)}, Theorem 3.23 implies
that X0 = {x ∈ X | x is an u-point of (X, RC(X, X0))}. Analogously, we get that
Y0 = {y ∈ Y | y is an u-point of (Y, RC(Y, Y0))}. Since f (X0) ⊆ Y0, we get that f
preserves the u-points. Hence, F g(f ) ∈ MCS(F g(X, X0), F g(Y, Y0)). So, F g is well
deﬁned on the morphisms as well. Obviously, F g is a functor.

Let F h : MCS −→ CS be deﬁned by F h(X, B) = (X, u(X, B)) (see Theorem
3.23 for the notation u(X, B)) on the objects of the category MCS, and by F h(f ) = f
on the morphisms of the category MCS. Then Theorem 3.23 implies that F h is well
deﬁned. Obviously, F h is a functor.

Using once more Theorem 3.23, we get that F g ◦ F h = IdMCS and F h ◦ F g =

IdCS. Hence, the categories CS and MCS are isomorphic.

Finally, we will show how our results imply the duality for contact algebras

described in [23].

Deﬁnition 3.27. ([23]) Let GMCS be the category whose objects are all mereo-
compact T0-spaces and whose morphisms are deﬁned as follows:

f ∈ GMCS((X, A), (Y, B))

26

iﬀ f : X −→ Y is a function such that the function

ψf : B −→ A, F 7→ f −1(F ),

is well deﬁned and is a Boolean homomorphism.

Corollary 3.28. ([23]) The categories CA and GMCS are dually equivalent.

Proof. We will derive this result from Corollary 3.13 showing that the categories CS
and GMCS are isomorphic. Let F i : CS −→ GMCS be deﬁned by F i(X, X0) =
(X, RC(X, X0)) on the objects of the category CS, and by F i(f ) = f on the mor-
phisms of the category CS. Then Lemma 3.24 shows that F i is well deﬁned on the
objects of the category CS. Let f ∈ CS((X, X0), (Y, Y0)). Then f : X −→ Y is a
continuous function and f (X0) ⊆ Y0. Now Corollary 3.14, (13) and (14) show that the
function ψf : RC(Y, Y0) −→ RC(X, X0), H 7→ f −1(H), is a Boolean homomorphism.
Indeed, we have that H ∈ RC(Y, Y0) ⇐⇒ H = clY (F ), where F ∈ CO(Y0); thus, for
every H ∈ RC(Y, Y0), H ∩ Y0 ∈ CO(Y0). Therefore, f −1(H) = clX(X0 ∩ f −1(H ∩ Y0)).
Then, using formula (13) and arguing as in the paragraph after it, we get that ψf is a
Boolean homomorphism. Hence F i is well deﬁned on the morphisms of the category
CS as well. Obviously, F i is a functor.

Let F j : GMCS −→ CS be deﬁned by F j(X, B) = (X, u(X, B)) (see Theorem
3.23 for the notation u(X, B)) on the objects of the category GMCS, and by F j(f ) =
f on the morphisms of the category GMCS. Then Theorem 3.23 implies that F j is
well deﬁned on the objects of the category GMCS. If f ∈ GMCS((X, A), (Y, B))
then f is a continuous map because B is a closed base of Y and f −1(B) ⊆ A. Let
F j(X, A) = (X, X0) and F j(Y, B) = (Y, Y0). We have to show that f (X0) ⊆ Y0,
i.e. that if x is an u-point of (X, A) then f (x) is an u-point of (Y, B). So, let x
be an u-point of (X, A), F, G ∈ B and f (x) ∈ F ∩ G. Then x ∈ f −1(F ) ∩ f −1(G)
and f −1(F ), f −1(G) ∈ A. Hence x ∈ f −1(F ).f −1(G) = ψf (F ).ψf (G) = ψf (F.G) =
f −1(F.G). Therefore, f (x) ∈ F.G and thus f (x) is an u-point of (Y, B). So, F j is
well deﬁned on the morphisms of the category GMCS. Obviously, F j is a functor.
Using once more Theorem 3.23, we get that F i ◦ F j = IdGMCS and F j ◦ F i =

IdCS. Hence, the categories CS and GMCS are isomorphic.

Since, by Theorem 2.22(a), a precontact algebra B is connected iﬀ its canon-
ical 2-precontact space X(B) is connected, all our results from this section which
concern dualities have as corollaries duality theorems for the corresponding full sub-
categories of the corresponding categories of (pre)contact algebras having as objects
all connected (pre)contact algebras. We will now formulate, as an example, the con-
nected variant of Theorem 3.4 and will left to the reader the formulation of all other
corollaries.

Theorem 3.29. The full subcategory PCAC of the category PCA whose objects are
all connected precontact algebras is dually equivalent to the full subcategory PCSC of
the category PCS having as objects all connected 2-precontact spaces.
