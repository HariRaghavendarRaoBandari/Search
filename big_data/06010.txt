ABSTRACT

The HST Frontier Fields cluster MACS J1149.6+2223 is one of the most complex merging clusters,
believed to consist of four dark matter halos. We present results from deep (365 ks) Chandra obser-
vations of the cluster, which reveal the most distant cold front (z = 0.544) discovered to date. In
the cluster outskirts, we also detect hints of a surface brightness edge that could be the bow shock
preceding the cold front. The substructure analysis of the cluster identiﬁed several components with
large relative radial velocities, thus indicating that at least some collisions occur almost along the
line of sight. The inclination of the mergers with respect to the plane of the sky poses signiﬁcant
observational challenges at X-ray wavelengths. MACS J1149.6+2223 possibly hosts a steep-spectrum
radio halo. If the steepness of the radio halo is conﬁrmed, then the radio spectrum, combined with
the relatively regular ICM morphology, could indicate that MACS J1149.6+2223 is an old merging
cluster.

1. INTRODUCTION

Galaxy clusters grow hierarchically by mergers with
other clusters and groups of galaxies, and by accretion
of uncollapsed gas and dark matter from the intergalac-
tic medium. Signs of this growth process include fea-
tures of ram-pressure stripping and instabilities (e.g.,
Nulsen 1982), shocks and cold fronts (e.g., Markevitch
& Vikhlinin 2007), diﬀuse radio emission (e.g., Feretti
et al. 2012), and signiﬁcant oﬀsets between the gas and
dark matter substructures (e.g., Clowe et al. 2004).
MACS J1149.6+2223 is a hot (T1000 = 9.1 ± 0.7 keV)5

5 T1000 refers to the temperature measured in a circle of radius
R1000 around the cluster center, where R1000 is the radius within
which the mean mass density is 1000 times the critical density of
the Universe at the cluster redshift. For MACS J1149.6+2223,

galaxy cluster at z = 0.544 (Ebeling et al. 2007). The
cluster was discovered as part of the Massive Cluster Sur-
vey (MACS; Ebeling et al. 2001), and has a total mass
of (1.4± 0.3)× 1015 M(cid:12) (1σ) within R500 (Umetsu et al.
2014). A strong-lensing analysis of the cluster, based
on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, has re-
vealed a massive merging cluster with a relatively shallow
mass distribution leading to a unique lensing strength
(Zitrin & Broadhurst 2009). A parametric lensing analy-
sis (Smith et al. 2009) showed that at least four merging
mass halos were needed to describe the strong-lensing
observables in this cluster (see also Rau et al. 2014;
Oguri 2015), making MACS J1149.6+2223 one of the
most complex merging clusters. MACS J1149.6+2223 is
now acknowledged as one of the most powerful cosmic
lenses, and is one of the clusters included in the Cluster
Lensing and Supernova Survey (CLASH; Postman et al.
R1000 = 0.83 Mpc (R1000 ∼ 0.45 R200).

2012), and in the HST Frontier Fields (Lotz et al. 2014).
Diﬀuse radio sources such as relics and halos are found
in some merging galaxy clusters (see, e.g., Feretti et al.
2012, for a review). MACS J1149.6+2223 possibly hosts
three such sources: a giant radio halo, a south-eastern
(SE) relic, and possibly another relic in the west (W)
(Bonafede et al. 2012). The radio halo was barely de-
tected in archival 1.4 GHz Very Large Array (VLA) data.
The combination of the archival VLA data with 323 MHz
Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations
suggested that the radio halo in MACS J1149.6+2223 has
an extremely steep spectral index6, α ∼ −2, indicating
either a less energetic merger (Brunetti et al. 2008) or
an old halo in which the relativistic particles have aged.
Possibly because the radio spectral index is so steep, the
cluster is an outlier on the LX−P relation (Cassano et al.
2013), as shown in Figure 1.

Here, we present results from deep Chandra observa-
tions of MACS J1149.6+2223. In Section 2, we discuss
the observations used and summarize the data reduction.
In Section 3 we detail the method used to model the
foreground and background components. Sections 4−7

times, in VFAINT mode, between 2001 and 2015, for a
total of 365 ks. The observations were analyzed using

Abell 1388 (z ≈ 0.18; von der Linden et al. 2014). In Ob-
sID 1656, Abell 1388 is positioned oﬀ-axis on the ACIS-I
detector, where the point spread function (PSF) is con-
siderably degraded. Because emission from Abell 1388
covers a large part of the Chandra FOV in ObsID 1656,
this observation is not very useful for the analysis of
MACS J1149.6+22238. Given the relatively short ex-
posure time of ObsID 1656 (∼ 20 ks), we excluded this
dataset from our analysis. Therefore, the results pre-
sented here are based on 305 ks of ﬂare-ﬁltered Chandra
data.

A summary of the seven ObsIDs used in this paper is

presented in Table 1.

3. BACKGROUND MODELING

The analysis of features in the outskirts of galaxy clus-
ters, where the ICM surface brightness is low, necessi-
tates a careful treatment of the background components.
We modeled the X-ray foreground and background us-
ing spectra extracted from regions free of ICM emission.
The stowed background was subtracted from the spec-
tra, and the remaining emission was described as the
sum of unabsorbed Local Hot Bubble (LHB) emission,
absorbed Galactic Halo (GH) emission, and absorbed
emission from unresolved X-ray point sources. The spec-
tral parameters of the Local Hot Bubble in the direction
of MACS J1149.6+2223 were determined from a ROSAT
All-Sky Survey (RASS) background spectrum extracted
in an annulus with radii 0.3 − 1.3 degrees around the
cluster center (0.3 degrees corresponds approximately to
3R200, and the inner radius was chosen to be so large
in order to avoid contamination from Abell 1388 in the
RASS spectrum). The temperature and normalization
of the Local Hot Bubble were kept ﬁxed to the best-
ﬁtting RASS values when ﬁtting the Chandra spectra.
The Galactic Halo parameters were linked for the seven
Chandra spectra. ObsIDs 17595 and 17596, and ObsIDs
16306 and 16582 cover essentially the same region of the
sky. For these pairs of observations, we kept the nor-
malizations of the power-laws (PL) describing unresolved
point sources free but linked. The power-law normaliza-
tions were free and unlinked for the other ObsIDs. The
indices of the power-laws were ﬁxed to 1.41 (De Luca &
Molendi 2004).

The spectra were binned to have a minimum of 1 count
per bin, and ﬁtted using the extended C-statistic (Cash
1979; Wachter et al. 1979) in XSpec v12.8.2. We re-
stricted the ﬁt to the energy band 0.7 − 7 keV. We
assumed the solar abundance table of Feldman (1992),
and Verner et al. (1996) photoelectric absorption cross-
sections. The hydrogen column density in the direction
of the cluster was ﬁxed to a value of 2.06 × 1020 cm−2,
which represents the sum of atomic and molecular hydro-
gen column densities9 in a circle with a radius of 1 degree
around the cluster center (Kalberla et al. 2005; Willingale
et al. 2013). In Table 2, we summarize the best-ﬁtting
sky foreground and background model. The model is
shown in Figure 3.

4. GLOBAL X-RAY PROPERTIES

8 We did not detect emission from Abell 1388 in the other Chan-

dra ObsIDs.

9 http://www.swift.ac.uk/analysis/nhtot/index.php

The surface brightness map of the cluster is shown in
Figure 4. The cluster is elongated in the NW-SE di-
rection, and has a single surface brightness concentra-
tion.
There is little substructure visible in the ICM,
unlike in some of the other Frontier Field clusters such
as MACS J0717.5+3745 and MACS J0416.1-2403 (e.g.,
van Weeren et al. 2015; Ogrean et al. 2015). The X-ray
emission is asymmetrical: more elongated towards SE
than towards NW, and brighter and more extended in
the SW than in the NE. A hint of a surface brightness
edge can be seen N-NE of the cluster center; the edge is
discussed in Sections 6 and7.

To measure the global properties of the cluster, we ex-
tracted spectra in a circle with radius R500 = 1.6 Mpc
(Sayers et al. 2013) around the cluster center,
chosen
to be at RA = 11h 49m 36s and Dec = +22◦ 24(cid:48) 05(cid:48)(cid:48).
Stowed background spectra extracted from the same re-
gions were subtracted from the total spectra. The re-
maining emission was modeled as the sum of sky back-
ground and ICM signal. The sky background param-
eters were ﬁxed to the values in Table 2. The ICM
was modeled with a single-temperature thermal com-
ponent (APEC; Smith et al. 2001; Foster et al. 2012).
The cluster redshift was ﬁxed to 0.544, while the other
parameters of the APEC model were free in the ﬁt.
We determined that MACS J1149.6+2223 has an av-
erage temperature T500 = 10.73+0.62−0.43 keV, a metallic-
ity Z500 = 0.20 ± 0.05 Z(cid:12), and a rest-frame luminosity
L500, [0.1−2.4 keV] = (1.62 ± 0.02) × 1045 erg s−1. The
R500 spectrum and the best-ﬁtting model are shown in
Figure 3.

5. ICM TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION

The contbin code (Sanders 2006) was used to divide
the surface brightness map of MACS J1149.6+2223 in
regions with 3600 counts from the ICM and sky back-
ground combined. The regions follow the contours on a
surface brightness map adaptively smoothed to achieve
SNR ≈ 10. The temperature distribution was mapped by
extracting spectra from each of the regions, and ﬁtting
them with a single-temperature absorbed APEC com-
ponent. The instrumental background was subtracted
from the data, while the sky background was kept ﬁxed
to the parameters listed in Table 2. The cluster redshift
was ﬁxed to 0.544, while the metallicity was ﬁxed to the
R500 value of 0.20 Z(cid:12). The resulting temperature map is
shown in Figure 5. An interactive version, which includes
the statistical errors on the measurements at a conﬁdence
level of 90%, is available at https://goo.gl/1CftGu and
in the online journal.
Throughout the ICM, the temperature is consistent
with ∼ 10 keV. Temperature jumps between adjacent re-
gions in Figure 5 would suggest the presence of shocks or
cold fronts in the ICM. However, we do not detect statis-
tically signiﬁcant (at 90% conﬁdence level) temperature
jumps. At 1σ signiﬁcance, there is a hint of a cold front
∼ 0.7−1 arcmin N-NE of the cluster center. This feature
will be examined more carefully in the next section.

shock fronts or to cold fronts, depending on the direction
of the temperature jump (e.g., Markevitch & Vikhlinin
2007). MACS J1149.6+2223 hosts one radio relic in the
SE, and a radio relic candidate in the NW (Bonafede
et al. 2012). Because radio relics are believed to result
from particle acceleration at shock fronts (e.g., Marke-
vitch et al. 2002; Markevitch 2006; Russell et al. 2012),
we searched for surface brightness edges near the loca-
tions of the SE relic and the NW candidate relic. Un-
fortunately, in all the Chandra ObsIDs, the cluster was
positioned near the edge of the FOV, in the SW corner
of the detector. This positioning means that the two
radio sources are at the very edge of the FOV, and all
the X-ray point sources near the diﬀuse radio sources
are signiﬁcantly extended. Because of this, even if sur-
face brightness edges were present near the diﬀuse radio
sources, there are not enough counts available in the pu-
tative pre-shock regions to allow us to detect these edges.

6.2. A N-NE Surface Brightness Edge

Sharp surface brightness edges are not immediately
visible in Figure 4. To search for weak edges, we ex-
amined the unsharp masked image of the cluster. The
unsharp masked image, shown in Figure 9, was created
by smoothing the surface brightness map with two Gaus-
sians of widths 3 and 15 arcsec, and dividing their dif-
ference to the map with the larger smoothing.
In the
unsharp masked image, a strong gradient is seen N-NE
of the cluster center.10 This gradient could indicate a
surface brightness edge.

We studied the putative surface brightness edge by ex-
tracting a surface brightness proﬁle in an elliptical sector
that approximately follows the X-ray surface brightness
contours near the possible edge. The sector and the sur-

10 We tried various smoothing scales between 2 and 25 arcsec,

but no additional substructure was revealed.

face brightness proﬁle across the putative edge revealed
by the unsharp masked image are shown in Figure 6. The
surface brightness proﬁle around the putative edge was
ﬁtted with three density models: a power-law density
model, a kink density model, and a broken power-law
density model. The density models were squared and
integrated along the line of sight assuming isothermal
plasma and a prolate spheroidal geometry. The broken
power-law density model was parametrized as:

where n is the electron number density, C is the den-
sity compression, and rd is the radius of the density

jump. The kink model is a broken power-law density
model with C = 1. The sky background level was cal-
culated by ﬁtting a constant to the surface brightness
at large radii, where no ICM emission is seen. The sky
background was consequently ﬁxed when ﬁtting the ICM
surface brightness. The systematic uncertainties on the
ICM density parameters were calculated by varying the
sky background within the 90% conﬁdence interval, and
added in quadrature to the 90%-level statistical uncer-
tainties. We assumed that the sky background does not
vary spatially outside the 90% conﬁdence interval.

We binned the proﬁle to have approximately 20
counts/bin, and ﬁtted it with a modiﬁed version of
the proffit package (Eckert et al. 2012). We used
Cash statistics, and compared the various ﬁts using the
likelihood-ratio test.

lipses mark regions from which point sources have been removed.
The outermost spectral region is not fully shown in this ﬁgure; its
actual area is about twice as large as shown.

In the proﬁle along the N-NE direction (Figure 6), a
weak edge is visible at a radius of ∼ 1.5 arcmin. The sky
background in this sector was modeled by ﬁtting a con-
stant to the radius range 6− 12 arcmin, and found to be
5.16+0.75−0.74 × 10−7 photons cm−2 s−1 arcmin−2. A broken
power-law density model ﬁt to radius range 1− 3 arcmin
yielded a best-ﬁtting density compression C = 1.57+0.09−0.12
(statistical plus systematic uncertainty, calculated as de-
scribed above). The broken power-law model is shown in
the bottom panel of Figure 6. The best-ﬁtting parame-
ters are summarized in Table 3.11

6.3. Hints of a Second NE Edge

In analyzing the N-NE edge, we detected a hint of an
additional surface brightness edge in the NE, approx-
imately 1 Mpc away from the cluster center. A sur-
face brightness map scaled to reveal this putative edge
is shown in the top-left panel of Figure 7. The surface
brightness proﬁle across the putative edge and the sector
from which it was extracted are also shown in Figure 7.
The best-ﬁtting broken power-law model that describes
the proﬁle has a density compression C > 1.13 at the

sociated with the sky background level are also consid-

The density compression is > 1 at a conﬁdence level of

7. THE NATURE OF THE BRIGHTNESS EDGES

11 The best-ﬁtting density compression does not change signiﬁ-

cantly if we assume that the cluster is an oblate spheroid.
12 We tried various sectors in which the putative edge was posi-
tioned between 300 − 1000 kpc, but the lower limit on the density
compression was always consistent with C > 1.1 and the location
of the discontinuity was essentially unchanged.

ﬁle across the N-NE brightness edge. The dashed arc shows the
location of the surface brightness edge. Middle: 0.5−4 keV surface
brightness proﬁle in the sector shown above, binned to a uniform
SNR of 5. This high binning is done here only for clarity; a more

rameters (see text for details). The instrumental background pro-
ﬁle is shown in blue. Bottom: Best-ﬁtting broken power-law den-
sity model ﬁtted to the surface brightness edge seen in the sector

ter center. The edge is best ﬁtted by a broken power-
law model with a density compression C = 1.57+0.09−0.12,
and there is evidence that it is associated with a cold
front; a shock front corresponding to a density com-
pression of 1.57+0.09−0.12 was rejected at a conﬁdence level
of 97.5% based on the temperatures on both sides of
the density jump.
If conﬁrmed, the cold front in
MACS J1149.6+2223, at z = 0.544, is the most distant
cold front discovered to date. Numerical simulations of
mass-limited cluster samples have shown that the frac-
tion of cold fronts up to redshift z = 1 depends only
weakly on redshift (Hallman et al. 2010). Observation-
ally, the fraction of clusters with cold fronts has been
estimated to be ∼ 50 − 70% with XMM-Newton and
Chandra (Markevitch et al. 2003; Ghizzardi et al. 2010).
The dearth of cold fronts detected at z ∼ 0.5 through
density and temperature jumps is most likely an obser-
vational limitation; detecting high-redshift cold fronts re-
quires very deep observations with X-ray satellites that
have arcsec spatial resolution.

MACS J1149.6+2223 is a major merger, and we ﬁnd
no evidence of a compact cool core. Therefore, the cold
front is most likely a merger cold front, caused by a rem-
nant subcluster core that decoupled from its dark matter
halo during the merger event. In this scenario, the cold
front should also have an associated bow shock . The pu-
tative surface brightness edge detected at 90% conﬁdence
further out in the NE, ∼ 1 Mpc away from the cluster
center, could be this bow shock. Approximating the cold
front to be spherical, with a sphere radius of ∼ 350 kpc,
the distance between the cold front and the putative bow
shock implies a Mach number of 1.3 − 1.4 (e.g., Farris &
Russell 1994). Such a Mach number would be similar
to those of the shocks detected in other galaxy clusters
(e.g., Macario et al. 2011; Russell et al. 2012). No dif-
fuse radio emission was detected near the location of the
putative shock front. If the shock is conﬁrmed, then the
lack of radio emission could be explained by a low Mach
number that would not allow it to eﬃciently accelerate
particles. Most shock fronts are traced by radio relics,
but there are also exceptions, such as in Abell 2146, in
which no diﬀuse radio emission was detected near the
shocks (Russell et al. 2011).

The substructures in MACS J1149.6+2223 were stud-
ied using the Dressler-Shectman (DS) test (Dressler &
Shectman 1988). The resulting map is presented in Fig-
ure 9. N-NE of the cluster, the DS map reveals substruc-
ture with a radial velocity component of ∼ 2500 km s−1
relative to the average cluster redshift (Golovich et al., in
preparation). The cold front and putative shock front de-
tected N-NE of the center of MACS J1149.6+2223 could
have been caused by the collision of this high-velocity
substructure with the main cluster. However, as fur-
ther discussed by Golovich et al. (in preparation), the
collision that led to the formation of the cold front is not
necessarily the same collision as the one that triggered
the formation of the radio halo detected by Bonafede
et al. (2012).

The DS map also shows multiple other substructures,
which indicate that MACS J1149.6+2223 is a very com-
plex merger between more than only two subclusters.
The complex nature of the merger is supported by its
dark matter distribution (Smith et al. 2009), which is

Fig. 8.— Regions used to measure the temperatures on both
sides of the N-NE brightness edge. The dashed cyan arc marks the
location of the density discontinuity.

The count statistics beyond the putative outer NE edge
are too poor (signal-to-noise ratio [SNR] ∼ 5) to allow a
temperature measurement, so we were not able to deter-
mine the nature of the outer NE edge. It could be either
a shock front or a cold front.

To determine the nature of the inner N-NE density
discontinuity, we extracted spectra from two polygons
(PGo – outer region; and PGi – inner region) on ei-
ther side of the discontinuity. The polygons are shown
in Figure 8. PGo has approximately 2200 ICM counts
(signal-to-noise ratio ∼ 40), while PGi has approxi-
mately 2900 ICM counts (signal-to-noise ratio ∼ 50).
The best-ﬁtting temperatures are TPGi = 8.23+1.46−1.01 keV
and TPGo = 9.88+3.13−1.94 keV, so the temperatures in PGo
and PGi are consistent with each other.

If the inner surface brightness edge is a shock front
travelling outwards through the ICM, then the Mach
number calculated from the density compression us-
ing the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions is M =
1.39+0.07−0.09. This Mach number corresponds to a temper-
ature jump TPGi/TPGo = 1.38+0.07−0.09. For a post-shock
temperature TPGi = 9.7 keV (statistically, the worst case
scenario; this is the upper 90% conﬁdence limit on the
temperature in PGi), this temperature jump would im-
ply TPGo ≈ 7.0± 0.4 keV. We reﬁtted the PGo spectrum
with the ICM temperature ﬁxed ﬁrst to 7.4 keV (again,
statistically, the worst case scenario) and then ﬁxed to
9.9 keV. The diﬀerence in statistics between the ﬁt with
TPGo = 7.4 keV and the ﬁt with TPGo = 9.9 keV is
∆C − stat = +4.99, which implies that a model with
a temperature TPGo = 7.4 keV is rejected in favor of
a model with TPGo = 9.9 keV at a conﬁdence level of
97.5%. This suggests that the inner edge is in fact asso-
ciated with a cold front, rather than with a shock front.

8. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Our Chandra analysis of the X-ray properties of
MACS J1149.6+2223 revealed a previously unknown sur-
face brightness edge located ∼ 350 kpc N-NE of the clus-

Fig. 9.— Top left: DS map of MACS J1149.6+2223. Circles show the projected locations of the cluster members, color coded for their
redshift. The radii of the circles are proportional to the likelihood that the galaxy belongs to a substructure with a diﬀerent line-of-sight
velocity and/or a diﬀerent velocity dispersion than the average. The Chandra surface brightness is shown in grayscale. Top right: Unsharp
masked image of MACS J1149.6+2223. The image was created from two 0.5 − 4 keV surface brightness maps smoothed with Gaussians
of widths 3 and 15 arcsec, by dividing their diﬀerence to the map with the larger smoothing. The surface brightness maps had the point
sources removed, and the “gaps” ﬁlled. Possible surface brightness edges on scales of 3− 15 arcsec (20− 95 kpc) appear as strong gradients
in the image. Putative edges are seen N-NE of the cluster center. The centers of the four DM halos identiﬁed by Smith et al. (2009)
are shown with sun crosses. The tail emphasized by the unsharp masking and the region in which the tail’s X-ray brightness peaks are
indicated with arrows. Bottom left: Same Chandra surface brightness map as in Figure 4. The centers of the four DM halos identiﬁed by
Smith et al. (2009) are shown with sun crosses. Bottom right: HST RGB image of MACS J1149.6+2223, based on observations using the

best described by a mass model consisting of four dark
matter halos. In the bottom left panel of Figure 9, we
mark the location of the four dark matter halos on the
Chandra surface brightness map. Given the high radial
velocity diﬀerences between substructures seen in the DS
map (top left panel in Figure 9 and Golovich et al., in
preparation), at least some of the collisions must have a
signﬁcant line-of-sight component. The Chandra obser-
vations of the cluster support a complex merger scenario,
in which the merger is seen primarily not in the plane of
the sky. With the exception of the cold front and the pu-
tative shock front N-NE of the cluster center, we found

no other surface brightness edges or temperature sub-
structures. Throughout the ICM, the temperatures are
very high, (cid:38) 8 keV.

Furthermore, in the X-ray surface brightness map, one
cannot visually separate the individual merging gas com-
ponents, as can sometimes be done in simpler mergers
occurring close to the plane of the sky (e.g., 1E 0657-56,
CIZA J2242.8+5301). In the top right panel of Figure 9,
we show the centers of the four dark matter halos iden-
tiﬁed by Smith et al. (2009) overlaid on the Chandra
unsharp masked image. The unsharp masked image re-
veals a “tail” of gas with a length ∼ 500 kpc, extending

SE from the cluster center. The surface brightness of
the tail peaks at the SE tip of the tail. The peak is due
to two small regions of X-ray excess, each approximately
40 kpc in diameter. These regions are not clearly asso-
ciated with X-ray or optical point sources, and they are
oﬀset ∼ 350 kpc east from the southernmost dark mat-
ter peak. The origin of the dense gas causing the X-ray
excess is unclear.

Given that MACS J1149.6+2223 possibly consists of
at least four merging DM halos, the lack of signif-
icant substructure in the ICM is somewhat surpris-
ing. For comparison, another Frontier Fields Cluster,
MACS J0717.5+3745, which also consists of at least four
merging DM halos, has an ICM that appears signiﬁcantly
more disturbed and presents several X-ray features asso-
ciated with shocks, cold fronts, and stripped gas (van
Weeren et al. 2015, and van Weeren et al. 2015b, sub-
mitted). The ICM of MACS J1149.6+2223 could appear
relatively regular if the merging subclusters collided per-
pendicularly to the plane of the sky. However, the centers
of the DM halos identiﬁed by Smith et al. (2009) are sep-
arated, in projection, by 250 − 750 kpc; these distances
seem too large for the collisions to have occurred perpen-
dicularly to the plane of the sky. Another possibility is
that MACS J1149.6+2223 is an old merger (see Golovich
et al., in preparation, for a discussion of the merger sce-
nario). If this is the case, then the collisionless DM halos
are still in the process of merging, while the collisional
gas halos have already merged.

The faint radio halo discovered by Bonafede et al.
(2012) could have a steep spectrum (relatively shallow
radio data suggests α (cid:46) −2; Bonafede et al. 2012).
A steep spectrum could point to an old radio halo, in
which particle aging caused a steepening of the spec-
trum, or to a less energetic merger (Brunetti et al. 2008).
MACS J1149.6+2223 is one of the most massive known
clusters, so it seems unlikely that the merger is less en-
ergetic. An old radio halo, which could be seen in an
old merger, would be consistent with the relatively reg-
ular ICM morphology. While the radio halo could have
been formed by an older collision between two of the sub-
clusters in MACS J1149.6+2223, a more recent collision
between a diﬀerent pair of subclusters might have given
rise to the cold front seen ∼ 350 kpc N-NE of the cluster
center (Golovich et al., in preparation). The same colli-
sion that triggered the formation of the radio halo could

also have resulted in the formation of the radio relic(s)
detected by Bonafede et al. (2012).

By combining high-quality X-ray, radio, and opti-
cal/lensing observations of MACS J1149.6+2223, one
could potentially set constraints on its complex merger
scenario. However, pinning down the merger geometry
would be diﬃcult.
