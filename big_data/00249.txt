ABSTRACT

Context. Over the past few years, several occasions of large, continuous rotations of the electric vector position angle (EVPA) of
linearly polarized optical emission from blazars have been reported. These events are often coincident with high energy γ-ray ﬂares
and they have attracted considerable attention, as they could allow one to probe the magnetic ﬁeld structure in the γ-ray emitting
region of the jet. The ﬂat-spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 is one of the most prominent examples showing this behaviour.
Aims. Our goal is to study the observed EVPA rotations and to distinguish between a stochastic and a deterministic origin of the
polarization variability.
Methods. We have combined multiple data sets of R-band photometry and optical polarimetry measurements of 3C 279, yielding
exceptionally well-sampled ﬂux density and polarization curves that cover a period of 2008–2012. Several large EVPA rotations are
identiﬁed in the data. We introduce a quantitative measure for the EVPA curve smoothness, which is then used to test a set of simple
random walk polarization variability models against the data.
Results. 3C 279 shows diﬀerent polarization variation characteristics during an optical low-ﬂux state and a ﬂaring state. The
polarization variation during the ﬂaring state, especially the smooth ∼ 360 ◦ rotation of the EVPA in mid-2011, is not consistent with
the tested stochastic processes.
Conclusions. We conclude that during the two diﬀerent optical ﬂux states, two diﬀerent processes govern the polarization variation,
possibly a stochastic process during the low-brightness state and a deterministic process during the ﬂaring activity.

1. Introduction
Blazars, a class of active galactic nuclei containing relativistic
jets of magnetized plasma pointed close to our line-of-sight, are
known to be highly variable in the optical polarization fraction
and electric vector position angle (EVPA) since the early days
of polarimetric observations of quasars (e.g., Kinman 1967).
Monotonic optical EVPA rotations spanning over days to months
and with amplitudes of up to several full cycles have been ob-
served for example by Kikuchi et al. (1988), Larionov et al.
(2008), and Marscher et al. (2010). However, the nπ-ambiguity
of EVPA makes it diﬃcult to detect large continuous rotations
(≥ 180 ◦) in sparsely sampled polarization curves. Therefore, a
signiﬁcant monitoring eﬀort with several participating observa-
tories is required to ﬁnd and study these events.

During the past few years several optical EVPA rotations
have been reported to coincide with ﬂaring activity in γ-ray
emission, as observed by the Fermi γ-ray Space Telescope at
GeV energies and atmospheric imaging Cherenkov telescopes

at TeV energies; for instance the ∼ 240 ◦ rotation in BL Lac
in 2005 (Marscher et al. 2008), in PKS 1510-089 the counter-
clockwise ∼ 720 ◦ rotation in 2009 (Marscher et al. 2010) and
the counter-clockwise ∼ 380 ◦ and clockwise ∼ 250 ◦ rotations
in 2012 (Aleksi´c et al. 2014b), and the rotation in W Comae (Sor-
cia et al. 2014). These coincident events include the rotations in
the bright γ-ray quasar 3C 279 (Abdo et al. 2010; Aleksi´c et al.
2014a). 3C 279 has exhibited large EVPA rotations on both short
(days) and long (months) time scales and with opposite senses
of rotation (Larionov et al. 2008; Abdo et al. 2010). The coin-
cidence of EVPA rotations and γ-ray ﬂares has raised consid-
erable interest towards optical polarization monitoring, since it
may give clues about the origin of the high energy emission in
blazars.

There are several open questions regarding the observed
EVPA swings: What physical processes produce the rotations
of the EVPA? Is it the same process for all events, in all objects,
or diﬀerent processes for diﬀerent events, even in the same ob-
ject? And is the γ-ray ﬂaring activity physically connected to the
rotations of the optical polarization angle or are those events just

coincidences (Blinov et al. 2015)? Various models have been
proposed to explain the EVPA rotations or, more recently, the
potential connection between the EVPA rotation and γ-ray ﬂares.
These models can be divided into two classes: deterministic
and stochastic models. The deterministic models include for ex-
ample the superposition of two emission components with diﬀer-
ent polarization characteristics (Holmes et al. 1984), the shock
compression of an ordered helical magnetic ﬁeld in an axisym-
metric, straight jet (Zhang et al. 2014, 2015), and several models
that are based on non-axisymmetric structures in the jet. The
latter group of models includes for example a global bend in
the jet, where a change of the viewing angle ∆θ can produce a
rotation of the EVPA ∆θ < χ < 180 ◦ due to relativistic aberra-
tion (e.g., Björnsson 1982; Nalewajko 2010). Abdo et al. (2010)
explained the 2009 swing in 3C 279 by a bent jet and Aleksi´c
et al. (2014a) used this same model for the swing in 2011. Non-
axisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration was invoked to ex-
plain EVPA swings in BL Lacertae objects by Konigl & Choud-
huri (1985), while Kikuchi et al. (1988) introduced a qualitative
model of a shock passing through a helical magnetic ﬁeld with a
changing pitch angle. Recently, Marscher et al. (2008) proposed
a model containing an emission feature, which does not ﬁll the
entire jet cross-section, on a helical trajectory probing diﬀerent
parts of a large-scale helical magnetic ﬁeld as it moves along the
jet. This model has been also applied to the 2006/2007 EVPA
swing in 3C 279 (Larionov et al. 2008).

The second class of models is based on a stochastic varia-
tion of polarization parameters of multiple cells (e.g., Jones et al.
1985; Jones 1988; D’Arcangelo et al. 2007; Marscher 2014).
These studies have shown that it is easy to produce random
EVPA changes that appear as a rotation of several hundred de-
grees. The two most recent models by Zhang et al. (2014, 2015)
– in the class of deterministic models – and Marscher (2014) –
in the class of stochastic models – particularly explore the con-
nection between EVPA rotations and γ-ray ﬂares.

One key argument in distinguishing between deterministic
and stochastic polarization variation is the smoothness of a con-
tinuous EVPA rotation (e.g., Marscher et al. 2008). Determin-
istic models should produce smooth EVPA variation whereas
stochastic models are expected to produce more erratic EVPA
curves. Here we develop a method, based on such a quantita-
tive measure of a curve smoothness, to test the stochastic mod-
els of polarization variability and apply it to the optical polar-
ization data set of 3C 279 collected during our intensive multi-
wavelength campaign in 2010–2012.

In section 2 we describe our almost three years of polarime-
try data. We introduce the quantitative measure of the EVPA
curve smoothness and analyse the polarization variation in sec-
tion 3. In section 4 and section 5 we test three simple random
walk processes against the observations, and these results are
discussed in section 6. A summary and conclusions are pre-
sented in section 7.

2. Data
An intensive VLBI and multi-waveband monitoring campaign
targeted on quasar 3C 279, including observatories covering ra-
dio, millimetre, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, X-ray, and γ-ray
bands, was carried out in 2010–2012 (Quasar Movie Project;
Kiehlmann et al., in prep.). For the period covered by the cam-
paign we have accumulated R-band photometry and optical (R
and V ﬁlters, spectropolarimetry at 5000–7000 Å, and white
light) polarimetry data from a number of existing blazar mon-
itoring programs and from an ad hoc campaign speciﬁcally tar-

geted on 3C 279. Furthermore, we include in our analysis some
data taken before the campaign period by the long-term moni-
toring programs, so that the data presented in this paper cover a
time range of JD 2454790–JD 2456120. The observations were
performed by (1) the 70 cm telescope of Abastumani Astro-
physical Observatory (Mount Kanobili, Georgia), (2) the 2.2 m
telescope of Calar Alto Observatory (Almería, Spain), (3) the
70 cm AZT-8 telescope of the Crimean Astrophysical Observa-
tory (CrAO; Nauchnij, Russia), (4) the 1.5 m KANATA telescope
of the Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory (Hiroshima, Japan), (5)
the 35 and 60 cm Kungliga Vetenskapakademien (KVA) tele-
scopes and (6) the 2 m Liverpool telescope of the Observato-
rio del Roque de Los Muchachos (La Palma, Canary Islands,
Spain), (7) the 1.83 m Perkins telescope of Lowell Observa-
tory (Flagstaﬀ, Arizona, USA), (8) the 1 m telescope of the
Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of
Sciences (SAO RAS; Nizhny Arkhyz, Russia), (9) the 1.3 m
SMARTS telescope of the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Obser-
vatory (Chile), (10) the 84 cm telescope of the Observatorio As-
tronómico Nacional (San Pedro Mártir, Mexico), (11) the 40 cm
LX-200 telescope of St. Petersburg State University (St. Peters-
burg, Russia), and (12) the 1.54 m Kuiper and 2.3 m Bok tele-
scopes of Steward Observatory (Mt. Bigelow and Kitt Peak, Ari-
zona, USA). In addition, data were also gathered in the observ-
ing campaign of the American Association of Variable Star Ob-
servers (AAVSO), and by individual observers (T. Krajci1 using
a 36 cm telescope and A. Sadun using the robotic 50 cm New
Mexico Skies (NMS) telescope 11). The participating observa-
tories are listed in Table 1.

Table 1 also includes, for most of the participating tele-
scopes, references to the descriptions of the programs and the
used data reduction procedures.
In the following we shortly
comment on the reduction of data from the rest of the telescopes.
Observations with the 1 m telescope of SAO RAS, the 70 cm
AZT-8 telescope of CrAO, the 50 cm telescope of NMS, and
by T. Krajci were made through colour ﬁlters intended to im-
plement the spectral response curve close to the one of Cousins
(1976) RC system. Various software implementations of the dif-
ferential aperture photometry technique were applied to measure
the brightness of 3C 279 on CCD images. Based on the seeing
conditions an appropriate circular aperture size was chosen by
each observer. The observers were advised to use the standard-
ized list of comparison stars maintained by LSW Heidelberg2,
although this was not always possible. Some observers used en-
semble photometry while others employed a single comparison
star. In particular, the 1 m SAO and the 70 cm AZT-8 CrAO tele-
scope images were reduced (see Doroshenko et al. 2005) using
the star N9 from González-Pérez et al. (2001).

We combined all R-band photometry into one light curve af-
ter cross-calibrating all data sets with respect to the SMARTS R-
band data to compensate for systematic oﬀsets between diﬀerent
instrument and telescope combinations and we converted magni-
tudes into spectral ﬂux densities (Kiehlmann et al., in prep.). We
removed one data point from the KVA polarimetry data, identi-
ﬁed as an outlier (> 60 ◦ intraday jump in EVPA) based on the
combined optical EVPA curve. Four data points in San Pedro
Mártir (SPM) polarimetry data were identiﬁed as outliers based
on the simultaneous EVPA jumps in both 3C 279 and 3C 273
which was observed together with 3C 279 in the framework of
the Quasar Movie Project. Additionally, we removed ﬁve data

points from the St. Petersburg, four points from the CrAO, and
one point from the Liverpool telescope datasets. These points
show large uncertainties and oﬀsets from the combined opti-
cal polarization fraction curve, that are not typical of 3C 279
on comparable time scales. We corrected the polarization frac-
tion curves for the statistical (Rician) bias following Pavlidou
et al. (2014). In optical the polarization fraction and the EVPA
depend only weakly on the frequency (see panels c and d in
Fig. 1). Therefore, we combine all optical polarization curves.
We follow the convention that the EVPA is measured counter-
clockwise from North. An increase of the polarization angle
refers to a counter-clockwise rotation projected on the sky.

Before analysing the data we averaged data points within 0.5
days in the R-band light curve and in the combined optical po-
larization curves. The averaging intervals are selected iteratively
instead of using ﬁxed time bins, taking into account the uneven
time sampling of the data. The polarization data is converted
to Stokes parameters before averaging and converted back after-
wards. The Stokes parameters are averaged weighted with the
uncertainties. The variability on time scales smaller than half a
day is at the order of the measurement uncertainties of individ-
ual data points. The averaging thus reduces the noise without
removing signiﬁcant real variations. The R-band light curve and
the combined optical polarization curves are shown in Fig. 1,
panel (b)–(d).

3. Polarization analysis
Before the description and analysis of the optical light curve and
the polarization curves we discuss a solution to the nπ-ambiguity
of the polarization angle and introduce a measure to quantify the
smoothness of a curve.

3.1. The nπ-ambiguity of the polarization vector
The EVPA, χ, is deﬁned within a 180 ◦-interval3 Thus, the
identiﬁcation of EVPA swings is ambiguous because of the π-
modulus: χ = χ ± nπ, n ∈ N. This nπ-ambiguity causes
problems in analysing EVPA variability, since the diﬀerence
∆χ = χ2 − χ1 ± nπ is ambiguous and even the direction of the
rotation is ambiguous (e.g., Marscher et al. 2008; Larionov et al.
2008; Abdo et al. 2010). To visualize rotations larger than π,
data points are usually shifted by nπ minimizing the diﬀerence
between adjacent data points:

χi,adj = χi − nπ with n = int

(1)
where int(·) denotes rounding to the nearest integer. This
procedure is based on the assumption of minimal variation be-
tween adjacent data points and relies on adequate sampling.

data point χi−1, i.e., ∆χred = |χi − χi−1|−(cid:113)

It has been suggested to consider the EVPA uncertainties
in this procedure (e.g., Sasada et al. 2011; Sorcia et al. 2013).
In that approach an EVPA data point χi is shifted according to
Eq. (1) only if it shows a signiﬁcant oﬀset from the previous
2 , where
eχi, eχi−1 are the corresponding uncertainties. This method re-
sults in EVPA curves that may depend on the choice of the ini-
tial two quadrants it is measured in. We consider, for example,
two data points χ1 = 40 ◦ and χ2 = 140 ◦ in the initial interval
3 The choice of the EVPA interval-limits is arbitrary. Usual limits are
0 ◦≤χ<180 ◦ or −90 ◦≤χ<90 ◦. We use the former.

[0, 180 ◦), both with uncertainty eχ = 10 ◦. Then, ∆χred = 85.9 ◦
and χ2 is not shifted, yielding a counter-clockwise rotation of
χ2 − χ1 = 100 ◦. Considering the same data in the initial interval
[−90, 90 ◦), i.e. χ1 = 40 ◦ and χ2 = −40 ◦, gives ∆χred = 65.9 ◦.
Again, χ2 is not shifted but this time yields a clockwise rotation
of −80 ◦. This method produces results that depend on the choice
of the initial interval. Instead, using Eq. (1) yields a consistent
result independently of the choice of the initial interval.

In appendix A we introduce a generalization of Eq. (1),
which considers more than a single preceding data point, and the
consistency level as a quality check of the adjusted EVPA curve.
Under the assumption that the adjusted EVPA curve accurately
represents the intrinsic variation of the EVPA curve, the consis-
tency level allows one to estimate the probability that the curve
is correctly reconstructed. A higher consistency level indicates
better sampling and a more reliable adjusted EVPA curve.

3.2. A quantitative measure of smoothness

To gauge the smoothness of an EVPA curve, we deﬁne a varia-
tion estimator, a quantitative measure of the (erratic) variability
of a curve. The larger the variation estimator, the less smooth
the curve is. First, we deﬁne the pointwise, local derivative of
the EVPA curve in units of degrees per unit time:

∆t
The mean of the derivative ¯χt = (cid:104)∆χ/∆t(cid:105) indicates a secular
trend of the data. The deviation of the local derivative from the
secular trend is calculated at each data point as:

A local derivative of the order of the secular trend indicates
a smooth variation with si ∼ 0. Deviation of the derivative from
the trend, ±si > 0, indicates erratic variation, i.e., the curve is
more jagged. We deﬁne the variation estimator as the mean ab-
solute si:

(cid:113)(cid:68)

(cid:69)

We use s as an estimator for the smoothness of a curve with
respect to a potential linear trend. An EVPA curve with s1 is
considered smoother than a second curve with s2 if s2 > s1.

The standard deviation of the pointwise derivative

s2
i
could be used as an alternative approach to quantify the EVPA
variability. Averaging over s2
i increases the weight of larger de-
viations from the secular trend compared to averaging over |si|,
which makes the standard deviation of si more susceptible to
outliers than the variation estimator deﬁned in Eq. (4). The mea-
sured variation estimator is biased by measurement errors and
curvature of the smooth EVPA variation. Measurement errors do
not average out because of the absolute mean in Eq. (4). Thus
errors increase the variation estimator. Only ﬁrst order trends
– estimated through (cid:104)(∆χ/∆t)(cid:105) – are considered to contribute to
real EVPA rotations in this analysis. This is the simplest as-
sumption about the intrinsic, smooth variability. Higher order
variation needs a priori knowledge and modelling of the varia-
tion, which is not given. This higher order variation (curvature)
increases the variation estimator, i.e., for non-linear determinis-
tic variation the smoothness of the curve can be underestimated.
Both biases are discussed in more detail in appendix B.

Before analysing the smoothness of the EVPA curve using
the variation estimator s it is crucial to average over data points
that occur over such small time intervals that the measurement
errors are expected to be larger than the real variation. EVPA
oﬀsets of the order of the errors at small time intervals will lead
to large local derivatives and artiﬁcially increase the variation
estimator s.

3.3. Optical polarization variation in 3C 279
Figure 1 shows the combined R-band light curve (panel b), the
observed optical polarization fraction (panel c) and EVPA curves
(panel d) from individual telescopes, the combined, debiased,
and averaged polarization fraction (panel e), the combined, nπ-
adjusted, and averaged EVPA (panel f), and the pointwise, local
derivative of the adjusted EVPA (panel g) of 3C 279 between
JD 2454790 and JD 2456120. The notable yearly gaps around
August–November are caused by the Sun proximity and split the
data into four observation periods (I, II, III, IV).

During the ﬁrst observing period (period I; Oct 2008–Nov
2009) the R-band light curve exhibits diminishing ﬂaring activ-
ity. During period II (Nov 2009–Aug 2010) the optical light

Article number, page 4 of 19

curve has a mean ﬂux density of only 0.5 mJy with a standard
deviation of σ( fν) = 0.2 mJy. Periods III (Nov 2010–Aug 2011)
and VI (Nov 2011–Aug 2012) show ﬂaring activity with the ﬂux
density ranging from 1.1 mJy to 6.6 mJy with a mean of 2.7 mJy.
These outbursts will be discussed in more detail in another paper
(Kiehlmann et al., in prep.).
The optical polarization fraction and the EVPA exhibit
strong variability. The polarization fraction ranges from ∼ 0
to 0.37 with a mean of ∼ 0.12 and a standard deviation of 0.08.
The EVPA shows swings in both directions with amplitudes of
up to 500 ◦. The EVPA variation looks smoother during the peri-
ods I, III and IV than during period II, as it is already evident in
the 180 ◦-interval, while the variation during period II does not
show any distinct structure. Furthermore, the lower scatter in the
plot of the EVPA derivative (panel g) during the periods I, III
and IV indicates a smoother variation.

In Figure 1, we also mark times at which the EVPA curve
shows an abrupt change in its behaviour. For each period of
consistent EVPA change (periods IIa to IVc, interrupted by two
observation breaks), we measure the EVPA rotation amplitude,
given by the diﬀerence between the minimum and maximum
EVPA, |∆χ| = max χ(ti) − min χ(ti), the corresponding duration
of the largest rotation, i.e.
the time passing between the mini-
mum and maximum of the EVPA curve, ∆t, the mean and stan-
dard deviation of the polarization fraction, the variation estima-
tor, s, and the consistency level of nπ-adjustments, Ncons (see ap-
pendix A). Errors on the polarization fraction mean and standard
deviation are estimated using a bootstrap method with 10 000 it-
erations. Furthermore, we estimate the error bias of the EVPA
variation estimator for each observing period through simula-
tions and calculate the debiased variation estimator for each pe-
riod using Eq. (B.1). The results are listed in Table 2.
The mean polarization fraction is low during period IIa as
compared to the ﬂaring periods, during which it can be up to ∼ 3
times higher. The standard deviation of the polarization fraction
ranges from 0.028 to 0.084. There is no clear connection be-
tween the mean polarization fraction and the standard deviation.
During period I the EVPA shows little variation within an
interval of 93 degrees. The time of the apparent 208 ◦ rotation
in 2009, reported by Abdo et al. (2010), is included in period I.
We discuss the absence of this apparent rotation in our data in
more detail in section 3.4. Period II exhibits erratic EVPA vari-
ability with an overall clockwise trend up to an amplitude of
at least 494 ◦. The low consistency level Ncons = 1 indicates
that period IIa is not sampled suﬃciently to reliably reconstruct
the intrinsic EVPA variation. The estimation of the probability
of correct reconstruction ranges from 0 % to < 76 % (c.f. ap-
pendix A).

There are six periods of smooth-looking EVPA rotations, pe-
riods IIIa–c, and IVa–c. The ﬁrst smooth EVPA rotation during
the period IIIa is an increase of 86◦ with a slow rate of +0.9◦/d,
which is followed by a sharp decrease of the EVPA by 110◦
with a rate of −16.0◦/d. This distinct change in the EVPA at
JD 2455650 takes place at the beginning of an optical ﬂaring pe-
riod. During the optical ﬂaring activity in the period IIIc, the
EVPA quite smoothly increases by 352◦ over 98 days, corre-
sponding to a mean rate of +3.6◦/d. In the period IVa, the EVPA
rotates 109◦ with a rate of +1.6◦/d and this rotation continues
in the period IVb for another 131◦ at a faster rate of +4.7◦/d.
Thereafter the sense of rotation changes again and the EVPA de-
creases by 140◦ at a rate of +3.6◦/d. Periods IIIb and IIIc have
low consistency levels, each due to a sampling gap. Figure 1
shows the unaveraged data points in these gaps as open symbols.
These data increase the consistency level, indicating a higher re-

The EVPA swings dur-
ing period IVa and IVb are well sampled Ncons>50, Ncons = 23,
corresponding to correct reconstruction probabilities of >99.9 %
and 63–99 %.

The EVPA variation estimator reaches its highest values dur-
ing period IIIb. We note that this result is strongly aﬀected by the
sparse sampling of the rapid rotation with only nine data points.
The secular trend of the EVPA is not reliably estimated and a sin-
gle data point diverging from this trend by ∼ 80 ◦/d drastically
increases the variation estimator which would otherwise be of
the order of sdebiased ∼ 5 ◦/d.
During period IIa, the EVPA variation estimator is signif-
icantly larger than in the subsequent periods, conﬁrming the
observation that the EVPA variation is more erratic during pe-
riod IIa and smoother afterwards. The erratic variations during
period IIa can be either intrinsic or, if the (heteroscedastic) mea-
surement uncertainties are underestimated, due to measurement
noise. The latter explanation would require the measurement
uncertainties during period IIa to be underestimated by a fac-
tor of 3.7, which is not plausible. Therefore, we conclude that
the erratic EVPA behaviour during period IIa is source-intrinsic.
The debiased variation estimator is ∼ 5 ◦/d during periods IIb–
IIIc, during period IVa it is at the order of the error bias, and
it increases towards the end of the data (period IVc) , when the
ﬂaring activity is declining.

3.4. The apparent 208 ◦ rotation in 2009
Abdo et al. (2010) report an apparent 208 ◦ clockwise rotation of
the EVPA in 3C 279 from JD 2454880 to JD 2454900 based on
KANATA data shown in Fig. 2. The larger than 180 ◦ rotation is a
result of the usual scheme of minimizing diﬀerences between ad-
jacent data points (c.f. Eq. (1)). The rotation is sparsely sampled,
particularly, there is one gap close to 90 ◦ between JD 2454888
and JD 2454892. Within the uncertainty of σ∆χ = 12.8 ◦ it is
unclear whether this diﬀerence corresponds to a clockwise or
counter-clockwise rotation.

PAs within the initial 0–180 ◦-interval, black circles the adjusted EVPA
curve. The numbers show the diﬀerence between adjacent data points
and the corresponding uncertainties in degrees.

Figure 3 shows additional data from four more telescopes.
Additional data from Calar Alto, Perkins, St. Petersburg and
Steward Obs. indicate changes of the rotation direction and vari-
ability within less than ∼ 90 ◦, instead of a continuous, large,
clockwise rotation. The KANATA data point at JD 2454888 ap-

pears to be a potential outlier. Omitting this data point, the EVPA
varies only within ∼ 60 ◦.

Calar Alto, Perkins, St. Petersburg, and Steward Obs.

The reported continuous, clockwise rotation of 208 ◦ cannot
be maintained. This example clearly demonstrates that densely
sampled data is necessary to treat the nπ-ambiguity.

3.5. Optical polarization variability and γ-ray activity
For a comparison with the optical light curves, panel a in Fig. 1
shows the Fermi-LAT γ-ray light curve at 0.1–300 GeV binned
into 3 day intervals. This light curve was originally published
in Hayashida et al. (2015). 3C 279 exhibits strong γ-ray ﬂaring
activity (> 10−6 ph s−1 cm−2) at various occasions. During the
ﬁrst period of high γ-ray activity around JD 2454800 the optical
EVPA is roughly constant. During the prominent ﬂare around
JD 2454890 reported by Abdo et al. (2010), we have shown that
the EVPA varies within less than 90 ◦, though the polarization
fraction drops signiﬁcantly. Two high activity states coincide
with observation gaps in the optical data. The high γ-ray ac-
tivity state at ∼ JD 2455666–2455741, showing multiple peaks,
coincides exactly with the 352 ◦ rotation of the optical polar-
ization angle during period IIIc and ﬂaring activity at optical
bands. Although the EVPA rotation and optical ﬂaring activ-
ity continues during periods IVa to IVc, γ-ray activity is low
(< 4 · 10−7 ph s−1 cm−2). In contrast to the 352 ◦ rotation of the
optical EVPA coinciding with strong γ-ray activity, the large ro-
tation during period IIa coincides only with mild γ-ray activ-
ity ((cid:46) 10−6 ph s−1 cm−2). We do not ﬁnd an obvious, consistent
correspondence between the optical polarization variability and
γ-ray ﬂaring activity. However, the fact that the 352 ◦ EVPA ro-
tation during the period IIIc exactly brackets a long-term γ-ray
active period, strongly suggests that this particular polarization
angle rotation event is connected to the γ-ray emission.

4. Random walk models
The prevailing physical scenario for launching relativistic jets
(e.g., Komissarov et al. 2007; Tchekhovskoy et al. 2011) in-
volves a strong, outwardly propagating, helical magnetic ﬁeld.
The ﬂow of plasma in the jet accelerates and becomes increas-
ingly collimated with distance from the black hole, with the mag-
netic energy density decreasing in favour of a higher kinetic en-
ergy density. It is likely that current-driven instabilities disrupt
the helical ordering near end of the jet’s acceleration zone (e.g.,

Nalewajko & Begelman 2012). This, plus transverse velocity
gradients in the ﬂow (e.g., Vlahakis & Königl 2004) probably re-
sult in the ﬂow becoming turbulent. Electrons can be energized
by second-order Fermi acceleration (Stawarz & Petrosian 2008)
and magnetic reconnections in the turbulent plasma (Sironi et al.
2015). We model such turbulence in terms of cells, each of
which contains a uniform magnetic ﬁeld, although the actual ge-
ometry is certainly more complex than this. We choose the ﬁeld
direction randomly from one cell to the next. Although more
sophisticated schemes have been used involving nested cells of
diﬀerent sizes (Jones 1988; Marscher 2015), here we limit our
analysis to the basic case of independent cells.

We investigate whether the observed polarization variation
characteristics ((cid:104)ml(cid:105), σ(ml), ∆χ, and s) can be produced by
stochastic processes. We do so by performing random walks in
Stokes parameters I, Q, and U, and comparing the properties of
the obtained polarization curves to the observed ones. The model
consists of Ncells cells. The properties of a sub-set of cells are
changed at each time step. The sampling of the total simulation
time T is randomized with time steps ∆t following a truncated
power law distribution P(∆t) ∝ ∆tα with α< − 1 within limits
[∆tmin, ∆tmax]. The parameters best describing the distribution
of time steps in each observation period are shown in Table 3,
col. 2–3. The distribution limits are directly adopted from the
data. We derive αt in the following manner: (i) from the observa-
tion time steps we calculate the maximum-likelihood estimator
(MLE) of the power law index ˆαt,obs, (ii) we simulate time steps
testing diﬀerent values of αt and calculate the MLE power law
index of the simulated time steps ˆαt,sim, (iii) we use the value of
αt for which ˆαt,obs = ˆαt,sim. The variation rate nvar sets the num-
ber of cells that change their properties per unit time step (one
day). The total number of cells changed between time ti and ti−1
is given by Nvar(ti, ti−1) = int (nvarti) − int (nvarti−1), where int(·)
denotes rounding to an integer. If Nvar(ti, ti−1) > Ncells all cells
are changed during that time step. In the following we deﬁne
three simple random walk processes, that diﬀer in the properties
of the cells and in the selection of cells be to changed.

4.1. Simple Q,U random walk process
We create Ncells initial cells with uniform intensity Ii. Each cell
has a uniform magnetic ﬁeld oriented randomly. The EVPA
is oriented accordingly. The cell size, thus, corresponds to the
largest scale of uniform magnetic ﬁeld. Uniformity implies that
each cell is maximally polarized. The polarization fraction ml,max
of synchrotron radiation in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is (Longair
2011, p. 217):
p − 1
p − 7

ml,max =

where p is the power law index of the electron energy dis-
tribution. The maximum polarization is ml,max ≈ 0.72 for
p = 2.5 (Longair 2011, p. 217). The initial random variables
ˆQi and ˆUi are drawn from a Gaussian distribution for each cell
i = 1 . . . Ncells. The Stokes parameters Qi, Ui for each cell are
obtained through the following normalization which yields the
same intensity and the maximum polarization for each cell:

The polarization fraction and angle are independent of the
total intensity I and we set I = 1. For the simple random walk
process the Nvar(ti, ti−1) cells that change are randomly selected
every time step. This implies that a single cell may have changed
several times between ti−1 and ti and that the total number of
diﬀerent cells that change is ≤ Nvar(ti, ti−1). The properties of

the selected cells are newly set following Eqs. (6) to (10). In the
following we abbreviate this simple random walk process siQU.
Jones et al. (1985) note that choosing ˆQi and ˆUi from a uni-
form distribution in the interval [−1, 1] produces almost iden-
tical results. We point out that this prior selection leads to pre-
ferred directions of the EVPA every 45 degrees and not a uniform
EVPA distribution.

4.2. Ordered Q,U random walk process with constant I
This process implements the basic concept of a disturbance pass-
ing through a turbulent medium, locally increasing the emissiv-
ity and successively highlighting part of the medium.
In this
case, the model cells are numbered. The ﬁrst cell represents the
disturbance and all the following cells are a trailing afterglow.
The initial cells are created exactly as in the simple Q,U random
walk process, but the subsequent cell selection diﬀers. Assuming
that N(ti) cells change between time ti−1 and ti, the properties of
all cells are shifted by N(ti) cells. The ﬁrst N(ti) cells, represent-
ing the region right behind the disturbance, are newly set with
random properties. The properties of the last N(ti) trailing cells
vanish. We call this process orQUc in the following. The orQUc
process is less randomized than the siQU process. Each cell the
disturbance passes through has its properties maintained for a
given amount of time. For the siQU process, on the other hand,
the properties of a single cell are maintained a random amount
of time depending on when it is randomly selected to change.

4.3. Ordered Q,U random walk process with decreasing I
For this random walk process we assume the intensity in a cell is
increased by a disturbance and gradually degrades as the distur-
bance moves on. The highest intensity of the emitting region is
located at the disturbance and decreases as function of distance
from the disturbance. We scale the cell intensities Ii linearly be-
tween the highest intensity at the disturbance (cell one) and zero
intensity at the Ncells+1th trailing cell:

Ii =

2I
+ Ncells

(Ncells − i)

(11)

cells

N2
The total intensity is again set to I=1. The cell properties are
set by Eqs. (6), (7) and (9) to (11). Cell properties are changed
following the scheme of the orQUc process (section 4.2). We
denote this process orQUd.

The three random walk processes are simplistic implementa-
tions of a ﬁnite emission region in a turbulent ﬂow that is either
randomly changing its magnetic ﬁeld structure (siQU) or is en-
ergized by a disturbance moving through the plasma (orQUc,
orQUd). These implementations face several limitations. The
siQU process does not include any structure information, the
individual cells do not have a speciﬁc position. The ordered
random walk processes assume the cells are all in line, whereas
multiple cells could be next to one another. This would aﬀect the
intensity scaling of the orQUd cells. All processes neglect that
the magnetic ﬁeld orientation cannot be entirely disconnected
between diﬀerent cells. Furthermore, a disturbance such as a
shock would locally order the magnetic ﬁeld and leave the ﬁeld
orientation in trailing cells correlated to some extent. Time de-
lays which would arise from the diﬀerent positions of the cells
are not considered and the modelling is performed in the ob-
servers frame under the assumption that neither the speed nor
the direction of the motion of the emitting region changes dur-
ing the polarization event. Relativistic aberration, which would

they intrinsically are, is also not considered here.

4.4. Integrated polarization

The integrated Stokes parameters I =(cid:80)Ncells

Ii and Q, U, accord-
ingly, determine the integrated intensity I, the linear polarization
fraction ml and the EVPA χ at each simulation time step:

Since the plasma is optically thin at optical frequencies and
the Faraday rotation scales with the squared wavelength of the
radiation, we can safely ignore the eﬀects of synchrotron self-
absorption and Faraday rotation on the polarized signal at optical
frequencies.

4.5. Simulated EVPA errors

We have tested two schemes of implementing the simulation of
observational uncertainties. In the ﬁrst scheme, we apply uncer-
tainties to the integrated Stokes parameters q = Q/I, u = Q/I.
For each simulated data point the uncertainties σq,i are ran-
domly drawn from the empirical cumulative distribution func-
tion (ECDF) of the combined q- and u-uncertainties measured
in the corresponding period (Fig. 4). In the simulation we set
σu,i = σq,i. Noise qerr,i, uerr,i is then drawn from a Gaussian
distribution N(0, σq,i) and it is added to each random walk data
point. The data points and uncertainties are then transformed
into ml, χ and the corresponding uncertainties following King
et al. (2014), eqs. 5-6. In the observed data the uncertainties in q
and u is generally not the same, but they scatter around this lin-
ear correlation. As a consequence this method does not exactly
reproduce the measured distribution of EVPA uncertainties.

In the second scheme we apply uncertainties directly to
the EVPA. The measured EVPA uncertainties can be described
by a log-normal distribution. The distribution parameters µunc
and σunc are estimated for each period individually. To sim-
ulate EVPA “measurement” errors we draw a random-number
σχi from a log-normal distribution LN(µunc, σunc) represent-
ing the measurement uncertainty of each simulated data point
χrw,i = χrw(ti). To each data point we then add noise χerr,i drawn
from a Gaussian distribution N(0, σχi) with zero mean and stan-
dard deviation σχi. Finally, each simulated EVPA data point is

given by χsim,i = χrw,i + χerr,i. This scheme produces EVPA un-
certainties more close to the observed distribution than the ﬁrst
scheme. Limitation of this approach are that uncertainties in the
polarization fraction are neglected and that the simulated EVPA
uncertainties are independent of the simulated polarization frac-
tion.

We ran all simulations presented in the following sections
with both schemes to test if the results depend on the speciﬁc
implementation of the uncertainty simulation. All results pre-
sented are based on the ﬁrst scheme, applying uncertainties to
the Stokes parameters. Whereas the absolute numbers, distribu-
tions and ﬁgures shown in the following slightly diﬀer using the
second scheme, the results and conclusions do not depend on the
choice of the uncertainty implementation.

4.6. Random walk simulations
We vary the primary input parameters in the ranges Ncells ∈
[2, 600], nvar ∈ [0.1 d−1, 100 d−1]. We run the simulations in
two modes. In the ﬁrst one, the cell number and the cell varia-
tion rate are randomly drawn from (discrete/continuous) uniform
distributions: Ncells ∼ Uint(2, 600) and nvar ∼ U(0.1, 100.0). We
run a total of 1 000 000 simulations for each random walk pro-
cess. Additionally we run simulations with certain chosen input
parameters. For each parameter combination and random walk
process we run up to 10 000 simulations. The choice of input
parameters is described in the following sections.

The ﬁxed secondary input parameters for the random walk
simulations are taken from Table 3. The total simulation time
T equals the duration of the corresponding period. For each
simulation we measure the mean polarization fraction (cid:104)ml(cid:105) and
its standard deviation σ(ml), the EVPA amplitude |∆χ|, and the
EVPA variation estimator s.

5. Random walk simulation results
In this section we ﬁrst describe general results of the random
walk simulations: expectation values of the mean and standard
deviation of the polarization fraction, a general comparison of
the three random walk processes, and dependencies between the
model parameters and various measured parameters. Then, we
test the periods of the two largest rotations in the observed data
(period IIa and IIIc) against the models. Finally, we test the ro-
tation amplitude distribution of the entire observed EVPA curve
against the random walk models.

5.1. Expectation values of the fractional polarization

For each random walk model we run simulations for selected
pairs of cell numbers and variation rates to test the expecta-
tion values of the mean and standard deviation of the polariza-
tion fraction. The ﬁxed parameters are taken from Table 3, pe-
riod “total”. The simulation time is T = 260 d, corresponding to

the average observation period between sun gaps. We run 10 000
simulations per a pair of parameters and a random walk model.
The mean and standard deviation of the simulated polariza-
tion fraction follow log-normal distributions for each input pa-
rameter combination. We estimate the distribution parameters
via maximum likelihood and from those we calculate the expec-
tation value and variance for (cid:104)ml(cid:105) and σ(ml), for each combi-
nation of Ncells and nvar. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The
expectation value of the mean of the polarization fraction is in-
dependent of nvar.

The siQU and the orQUc process produce the same amount
of polarization. Simulated curves from the orQUd process are
on average more polarized by a factor of 1.13–1.15. As antic-
ipated, for all processes the expected mean of the polarization
fraction depends on the cell number by E[(cid:104)ml(cid:105)] ∝ 1/

The expectation value of the standard deviation of the polar-
ization fraction increases with increasing nvar and decreases
with increasing Ncells. For high variation rates it saturates at

Typically, similar relations connecting the cell number and
cell variation rate with the expectation values of the polarization
fraction mean and standard deviation are used to ﬁx the model
parameters based on the observed polarization fraction, when
testing stochastic models against the data (e.g., D’Arcangelo
et al. 2007). We do not recommend to ﬁx these parameters,
as each pair of model parameters results in a broad distribution
of (cid:104)ml(cid:105) and σ(ml) with standard deviations up to Var((cid:104)ml(cid:105)) 1

tailed. Thus, the expectation value does not match with the dis-
tribution mode. Furthermore, the parameter combination most
likely producing the observed polarization fraction may not be
the best choice for producing the observed EVPA variability.
Instead, we recommend to test a large parameter space and to

5.2. Model comparison and parameter dependencies

Figure 6 shows the distribution of the mean and standard de-
viation of the polarization fraction and the EVPA amplitude
and variation estimator for each tested random walk process
with primary model parameters in the ranges Ncells ∈ [2, 600],
nvar ∈ [0.1 d−1, 100 d−1], secondary parameters as listed in Ta-
ble 3, period “total”, and a total time of T = 260 d. Each dis-
tribution is based on 1 000 000 simulations. The distributions
are aﬀected, especially at the lowest values, by the limits of the
tested parameter space, and the EVPA amplitude distribution ad-
ditionally depends on the simulation total time.

The comparison of the three random walk processes based
on Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 shows, that the siQU process is less variable
than the orQU process, resulting on average in smaller EVPA
amplitudes but smoother EVPA curves. The reason is, that in the
siQU process single cells may change multiple times within one
time step, thus the number of cells that stay the same is larger
than in the ordered random walk processes. The orQUd process
is generally more polarized and more variable, resulting in larger
EVPA amplitudes and more erratic EVPA behaviour. Given the
intensity scaling of the cells in the orQUd process, this process
is comparable to the orQUc process with de facto fewer cells.

In general, increasing the cell number decreases the mean
and standard deviation of the polarization fraction, the average
EVPA rotation amplitude and the variation estimator, while in-
creasing the cell variation rate increases the distribution means
of all measured parameters. Consequentially, there is a corre-
lation between the EVPA rotation amplitude and the variation
estimator in the simulations. Larger EVPA rotations are indeed
on average less smooth, as one would intuitively expect.
The results furthermore show that in principle very smooth
EVPA curves s ∼ 1 ◦/d and very large rotations ∆χ (cid:29) 360 ◦ can
be produced by a random walk process. However these prop-
erties are to some extent mutually exclusive. Therefore, it is
mandatory to simultaneously consider both the rotation ampli-
tude and the quantiﬁed smoothness in the analysis of the random
walk simulations.

5.3. Probabilities of observed polarization variability

The main aim of these simulations is to determine the probability
of producing the observed polarization variability characteristics
by a random walk process. We use (cid:104)ml(cid:105) and σ(ml) to characterize
the polarization fraction variation, while ∆χ and s are used to
characterize the EVPA variation.
In the following, we deﬁne
four test conditions.
First, we deﬁne two polarization fraction conditions (PF1,
PF2): We search for simulations with (cid:104)ml(cid:105) and σ(ml) in ranges
[x−∆x, x+∆x], where x is the corresponding observed value and
∆x is equal to the scatter of the observed (cid:104)ml(cid:105) and σ(ml) (c.f. Ta-
ble 2). We note, that the interval range is an arbitrary choice and
the ﬁnal probabilities depend on the accepted range of parame-
ters. Our choice is to set the accepted parameter range based on
the data instead of preselecting a ﬁxed value.

Second, we deﬁne two polarization angle conditions (PA1,
PA2): We search for EVPA rotations with amplitudes as large
or larger than observed ∆χ ≥ ∆χobs which are at the same time
as smooth or smoother than the observed data, s ≤ sobs. Fi-
Article number, page 10 of 19

nally, we search for simulations fulﬁlling all four conditions
(PF1+PF2+PA1+PA2).

We run simulations for various input parameter combina-
tions Ncells,i, nvar, j. For each parameter combination i j we run a
set of Nsim=10 000 simulations. From each simulation set i j we
ﬁnd the number of simulations in agreement with our conditions,
Ni j,cond. The probability of producing a polarization curve in
agreement with this condition from a random walk process with
input parameters (Ncells,i, nvar, j) is Pi, j(cond) = Ni, j,cond/Nsim. The
highest probability is Pmax(cond) = max
Pi, j(cond) with the opti-
i, j
mal input parameters (Nopt
var). The accuracy of this probabil-
ity estimation depends on the sampling of the input parameters.
Large rotations of the polarization angle are of particular in-
terest. Therefore we test the random walk simulations against
the two largest rotations in our data, observed during the peri-
ods IIa and IIIc. In particular, we test period IIIc because of its
contemporaneity with strong γ-ray ﬂaring activity. We will com-
pare these two periods as they show very diﬀerent behaviour in
the smoothness of the EVPA rotation, the polarization fraction
and the total ﬂux. We discuss the other periods qualitatively af-
ter the detailed study of periods IIa and IIIc.

5.3.1. Period IIa
We sample the input parameter space in the ranges Ncells =
[80, 90, . . . , 260] and nvar = [4, 8, . . . , 60] d−1. For each param-
eter pair we run 10 000 simulations. The ﬁxed parameters are
taken from Table 3, period II. The simulation time is T = 154 d.
The simulation selection conditions are:

Figure 7 shows the probability distributions over the input
parameter space for the polarization fraction conditions (PF1/2,
ﬁrst row), the EVPA conditions (PA1/2, second row), and for all
four conditions (PF1/2+PA1/2, third row) for each of the three
random walk processes. The third row of Fig. 7 indicates that
the tested parameter space is suﬃciently large to capture the re-
gion of highest probability given all four conditions. The highest
probabilities and the corresponding optimal input parameters are
listed in Table 4.
The highest probability of producing the observed polariza-
tion fraction characteristics (conditions PF1/2) is ∼ 18 %. It is
relatively low because the observed standard deviation of the
polarization fraction of 0.03 is larger than the maximum value
of σ(ml) expected from a random walk producing a mean po-
larization fraction of 0.05, which is 0.025. EVPA rotations of
equal or higher amplitude and comparably smooth or smoother
than observed (conditions PA1/2) are occurring with probabil-
ities up to 10–18 % in the tested parameter space. The proba-
bility of producing the observed variability in both the polariza-
tion fraction and angle (conditions PF1/2+PA1/2) is relatively
low compared to the individual conditions. The reason is that
the comparably high standard deviation of the polarization frac-
tion requires higher cell variation rates than the observed EVPA
variability. The discussed processes are capable, however, of
producing the observed polarization characteristics with a prob-
ability up to ∼ 3 %.

that rotations as large as observed commonly occur in random
walk processes, given the observed polarization fraction. The

is characteristic of a stochastic process.

Figure 9 shows the probability distribution over the tested pa-
rameter space for all three random walk processes (columns 1–3)
and diﬀerent selection conditions. The probability of produc-
ing the observed polarization fraction characteristics (conditions
PF1/2) during period IIIc is shown in the ﬁrst row and ranges up
to ∼ 7 % (c.f. Table 5). The observed standard deviation of the
polarization fraction of 0.057 is relatively low compared to the
value ∼ 0.065 expected from a random walk with a mean polar-
ization of 0.131. Thus, the probability of producing the observed
mean and standard deviation is relatively low.

The second row of Fig. 9 shows the probability of produc-
ing EVPA rotations with amplitudes at least as large as the ob-
served rotation (condition PA1). Those rotations are most likely
produced by a few cells and high cell variation rates. On the
other hand, the observed low EVPA variation estimator, which
indicates a smooth EVPA curve, can only be produced by ran-
dom walk models with low cell variation rates and preferentially
many cells as shown in the third row of Fig. 9 (condition PA2).
Consequentially, the probability of producing an EVPA rotation
at least as large and at least as smooth (conditions PA1/2) is low
(c.f. Table 5).

In Fig. 10 we show the distribution of the rotation amplitude
(upper panel) and the EVPA variation estimator (lower panel)
based on the simulations which show the observed polarization
fraction characteristics (conditions PF1/2). On one hand, the ob-
served rotation amplitude is close to the distribution mode. On
the other hand, the EVPA variability coming from a stochastic
process would be expected to be far more erratic. Compara-
bly smooth or smoother variations than observed do occur, but
only rarely and, most importantly, those simulations do not pro-
duce large rotation amplitudes. Consequentially, we do not ﬁnd

a single occurrence of variability comparable to the observed pe-
riod IIIc in both the polarization fraction and angle (conditions
PF1/2+PA1/2) at any tested point in the parameter grid. There-
fore, we conclude that it is very unlikely that a stochastic pro-
cess could produce the observed EVPA rotation during the pe-
riod IIIc.

5.3.3. Other periods
We have focused on the two most prominent rotations during
the periods IIa and IIIc when testing the stochastic models. In
this section we discuss the other periods qualitatively. During
period I the EVPA shows little variability ((cid:46) 90 ◦). Though not
explicitly tested for the polarization fraction of period I, the tests
of periods IIa and IIIc suggest that such small EVPA amplitudes
are unlikely to occur from the tested random walk processes (c.f.
Figs. 8 and 10), given that the variability in the polarization frac-
tion is the highest during period I. Consistent with the likely non-
stochastic period IIIc, the polarization fraction and the total ﬂux
is mostly high compared to period IIa. The average polarization
fraction drops and the EVPA variability becomes more erratic
with the fading ﬂare. If both periods are indeed of deterministic
origin, the smooth and weak EVPA variability during period I
on the one hand, and the smooth and strong variability during
period IIIc on the other hand, imply a complex behaviour of 3C
279.

Period IIb shows a low-brightness state in R-band. Neverthe-
less, the polarization fraction is exceptionally high in the mean
and standard deviation and the EVPA variation estimator is sim-
ilarly low as during the ﬂaring states. Whether this drastic in-
crease in the polarization fraction marks the beginning of the
following ﬂaring state, without showing up yet in the total ﬂux
density, cannot be properly tested because of the following ob-
servation gap.

sponding cumulative distribution function (ECDF, red curve).

The polarization fraction and the EVPA variation estimator
during period IIIa are comparable to period IIIc despite the sig-
niﬁcantly lower rotation rate. Figure 10 suggests that we would
expect a larger rotation amplitude from a random walk model,
arguing against a stochastic process. Claiming a non-stochastic
origin for periods IIIa and IIIc implies that also period IIIb
should be produced by another process rather than a random
walk. If all periods IIIa-c originate in the same event, the sharp
clockwise rotation opposite to the counter-clockwise direction of
the enclosing rotations poses a challenge to any non-stochastic
model. Although not explicitly tested we suspect period IVa not
to be consistent with the random walk processes, given the con-
tinuous, smooth rotation.

5.4. EVPA rotation amplitude distribution

In appendix C we introduce a method to automatically identify
continuous rotations in an EVPA curve based on the strict crite-
rion that a continuous rotation begins and ends with a signiﬁcant
change of the rotation direction at a certain signiﬁcance level ς.
We point out that the rotations discussed thus far do not strictly
follow this criterion, but were instead deﬁned as the maximum
change of the EVPA within a certain time period that shows a
general trend in the EVPA. However, in this section we follow
the strict deﬁnition. At a ς=3 signiﬁcance level 109 rotations are
identiﬁed in the optical EVPA curve. The distribution of the rota-
tion amplitudes is shown in Fig. 11. In appendix C.2 we discuss
characteristics of the rotation amplitude distribution originating
from the random walk models.

To test

the observed distribution of rotation amplitudes
against the random walk models we run long simulations with
a total time T = 100 000 d varying the model parameters in
the ranges Ncells,i ∈ [10, 20, . . . , 300], nvar, j ∈ [2, 4, . . . , 20] d−1
for each random walk process. Secondary model parameters are
taken from Table 3, period “total”. For each simulation the rota-
tions are identiﬁed at ς=3 signiﬁcance level and the distribution
of the rotation amplitudes is tested against the rotation amplitude

ing the rotation amplitude distribution of the entire EVPA curve against

distribution of the entire EVPA curve using a two-sample Kol-
mogorov–Smirnov (KS) test. We note, that this analysis is not
feasible for the individual periods as too few identiﬁed rotations
do not allow us to estimate the distribution of rotation amplitudes
reliably.

The p-values of the KS tests are shown in Fig. 12 over the
tested parameter space for each random walk process. Solid
curves mark the edge of the parameter space where the hypoth-
esis that the observed distribution of rotation amplitudes orig-
inates in the tested random walk process is rejected. For cell
numbers lower than 50 the hypotheses that the observed EVPA
rotations are produced by the siQu, the orQUc, or the orQUd
process are rejected at 1σ, 2σ, and 3σ signiﬁcance, respectively,
regardless of the cell variation rate. In Fig. 9 we have shown that
cells fewer than this are needed to produce the high mean po-
larization fraction for instance during period IIIc. Additionally,
cell variation rates > 5 cells per day are preferred to produce the
observed variability in the polarization fraction. At these vari-
ation rates the hypothesis that the observed EVPA rotations are
produced by one of the tested processes is rejected at least at
2σ signiﬁcance. Therefore, we conclude that the distribution of
the rotation amplitudes identiﬁed in the entire EVPA curve can-
not be produced by the tested random walk process with a ﬁxed
number of cells.

6. Discussion: Two processes?
EVPA rotations of opposite direction in 3C 279 have been re-
ported before in the literature (Larionov et al. 2008; Abdo et al.
2010). In the data presented here, we observe several changes
of the rotation direction with two large rotations during the peri-
ods IIa and IIIc. These two periods show signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
variability in the optical ﬂux and optical polarization. During
the period IIa the ﬂux and the polarization fraction are lower and
less variable, whereas the EVPA is more erratic than during the
period IIIc. Testing the polarization data of both periods against
random walk models makes the diﬀerence even more evident.
We have shown that the erratic behaviour of the EVPA during

though the probability of (cid:46) 3 % is not high, the discussed models
are capable of producing the observed polarization variability.
Most likely around 170 or 220 cells (depending on the process)
are necessary to produce the observed behaviour. On the other
hand, the high polarization fraction during the period IIIc re-
quires signiﬁcantly fewer cells ∼ 30, implying that this polarized
emission is produced in a much smaller region. We have shown
that the long and smooth rotation of the EVPA during this pe-
riod is highly unlikely to originate in a stochastic process and we
could not reproduce the observed variability in the polarization
fraction and angle with any of the tested stochastic processes.
A deterministic origin of this EVPA rotation is furthermore sup-
ported by the exact contemporaneity with a strong γ-ray ﬂaring
period.

We come to the conclusion that we likely observe two diﬀer-
ent processes responsible for the polarization variability during
the low-brightness state and the ﬂaring state of 3C 279. Dur-
ing the low-brightness state the polarization is consistent with
a stochastic process. We have argued that the observed vari-
ability is unlikely to be an observational artefact due to low
signal-to-noise data and underestimated uncertainties, but it is
source-intrinsic. This variability is consistent with a stochastic
process as implemented by the siQU, orQUc, and orQUd pro-
cess, modelling a general turbulent ﬂow (siQU), a disturbance
passing through a turbulent medium or, vice versa, a turbulent
medium passing through a local disturbance (orQUc, orQUd).
These models are not distinguishable, except from requiring dif-
ferent model parameters to produce the observed polarization.
We suggest that the polarization during the low-brightness state
is aﬀected by the turbulent ﬂow with a relatively large number of
emission cells having individual magnetic ﬁeld orientations, thus
producing a relatively low mean polarization fraction. We sug-
gest that this stochastic variability of the polarization is always
present, but only dominant during the low-brightness state.

In the data we ﬁnd two phases which might be transitions
from a deterministic to a stochastic process. In period I the ini-
tial high activity state in optical and γ-rays dissolves. With the
fading ﬂares the polarization fraction drops and the EVPA vari-
ability becomes far more erratic (c.f. Fig. 1). Again, throughout
period IVb and towards the end of IVc, when the ﬂux density is
decreasing, the EVPA variability estimator rises. These phases
could imply that with the ﬂaring emission fading the turbulent
background becomes more dominant again.

6.1. Deterministic process during period IIIc
During the ﬂaring state the polarization fraction is on aver-
age higher than during the low-brightness state, indicating that
the polarized ﬂux is dominated by a smaller emission region.
The polarization variability cannot be explained by the tested
stochastic models. Although we tested only very simplistic
random walk processes, this result challenges more sophisti-
cated stochastic models such as the turbulent extreme multi-zone
model (TEMZ) (Marscher 2014). In contrast to stochastic mod-
els, deterministic models are expected to produce smooth EVPA
rotations, some of them following distinct patterns. In the fol-
lowing we discuss several models presented in the literature.

Laing (1980) discusses the shock compression of a tangled
magnetic ﬁeld into an apparently ordered one to explain a high
polarization fraction despite a generally random ﬁeld structure.
In principle, this process can produce an EVPA swing if the
initially tangled magnetic ﬁeld produces a low net polarization
which is oriented diﬀerently than compressed, apparently or-

dered ﬁeld. But this eﬀect can produce swings only up to 90 ◦ at
maximum. The more generic case of two superposed, evolving
emission features discussed by Holmes et al. (1984) is also lim-
ited to swings < 90 ◦. The observed ∼ 360 ◦ rotation excludes
these models.

Two purely geometric models are based on curved trajecto-
ries of the emission region. In the ﬁrst model, Nalewajko (2010)
assumes an axially symmetric magnetic ﬁeld and a global bend
of the ﬂow. Relativistic aberration can drastically change the ob-
served EVPA of the emission region going through even a small
bend, if also the viewing angle is small. Yet, the EVPA rota-
tions in this model are limited to < 180 ◦ for a simple bend on
a plane (Nalewajko 2010). Abdo et al. (2010) used this model
to explain the apparent ∼ 208 ◦ EVPA swing in 3C 279 within
the 20 days after JD2454880. We have shown, though, that this
apparent rotation was an artefact of the sparse sampling and that
additional data does not support the smooth, long trend initially
reported. Aleksi´c et al. (2014a) observed the period IIIc rotation
only partially with an amplitude of ∼ 140 ◦ and used the same
bending jet model to explain this event. The full ∼ 360 ◦ rotation
cannot be explained by a single ﬂaring region on a slightly bent
trajectory. This rotation would either require a helical jet struc-
ture or at least two successive emission regions passing through
the bend. Although we observe several sub-ﬂares in the R-band
light curve during the EVPA rotation, these consecutive ﬂaring
regions would likely need signiﬁcant ﬁne-tuning in the time sep-
aration of the individual events to produce a continuous 360 ◦ ro-
tation.

The second geometric model describes an emission feature
smaller than the cross section of the jet on a helical trajectory
traversing through a helical magnetic ﬁeld (Kikuchi et al. 1988;
Marscher et al. 2008). On its path the feature highlights diﬀer-
ent parts of the magnetic ﬁeld structure producing a gradually
changing EVPA. In contrast to the previous models this one is
not restricted by an upper limit of the rotation amplitude, but
can naturally produce in principle arbitrarily long rotations. The
deviations from a constant rotation rate can originate, e.g., in
changes in the ﬂow speed, varying light-travel time delays along
the helical path, or the superposition of the emission feature and
a constantly (or randomly) polarized background (e.g., Marscher
et al. 2010; Larionov et al. 2013).

Zhang et al. (2014, 2015) suggest that EVPA swings can oc-
cur due to light travel time eﬀects when a relativistically mov-
ing plasma pervading a helical magnetic ﬁeld encounters dis-
turbance such as a shock.
In contrast to previously discussed
models this one naturally explains contemporaneous EVPA ro-
tations and ﬂaring activity throughout the entire spectrum from
microwaves up to γ-ray emission, which could explain the con-
temporaneity of the EVPA rotation and the γ-ray ﬂaring dur-
ing period IIIc (Fig. 1). However, in the model by Zhang et al.
(2014) a single event can only produce EVPA rotations up 180 ◦.
To explain the observed rotation in the period IIIc, at least two
successive ﬂaring events would be needed. There are two sharp
drops observed in the polarization fraction during the EVPA ro-
tation in the period IIIc, which qualitatively ﬁts the behaviour
expected from the Zhang et al. (2014) model. However, detailed
modelling will be needed to test whether the non-stochastic
∼ 360 ◦ EVPA rotation during the period IIIc can be produced
by the non-axisymmetric helical motion model or by the axisym-
metric model of a shock in a helical magnetic ﬁeld.
The most critical challenge to deterministic models produc-
ing large EVPA rotations (≥180 ◦) are the multiple inversions
of the rotation direction observed throughout the entire polar-
ization data. Diﬀerent directions in the non-ﬂaring and in the

S. Kiehlmann et al.: Polarization angle swings in blazars: The case of 3C 279

ﬂaring state can be explained with the two-processes interpre-
tation, as a stochastic process during the non-ﬂaring state pro-
duces rotations in both directions equally likely. But we observe
inversions of the rotation direction even within period IIIc. De-
terministic models that are capable of producing two-directional
EVPA swings such as the two-component model (Holmes et al.
1984) and some of the models presented in Zhang et al. (2014)
typically are limited to amplitudes ≤90 ◦, producing a rotation
followed by a counter-rotation back to the original orientation;
whereas a single bend in the jet, a helical path of the emission
feature in a helical magnetic ﬁeld and the models in Zhang et al.
(2014) that produce 180 ◦ rotations are expected to be geometri-
cally bound to a single EVPA rotation direction. The superpo-
sition of these models with a constantly or randomly polarized
background and the superposition of multiple events overlapping
in time could produce more complex patterns in the EVPA vari-
ability. For example, two emission regions, each on its own may
produce a clockwise rotation of the polarization angle. Follow-
ing the two-component model of Holmes et al. (1984), the su-
perposition of both regions may temporarily produce a counter-
clockwise rotation of less than 90 ◦, if these regions change their
physical properties as the total intensity or spectral index, for in-
stance when a new emission feature progressively outshines the
previous one. This superposition could lead to two inversions of
the rotation direction as seen in period IIIc. Considering more
than one component, of course, drastically increases the model
complexity.

6.2. Comparison with recent RoboPol results

Blinov et al. (2015) investigate the potential connection between
γ-ray ﬂares and rotations of the optical polarization angle in
a statistical way based on a large sample of blazars monitored
with the RoboPol instrument. They show that a stochastic pro-
cess can in principle produce the rotation amplitudes observed,
but it is statistically unlikely that all rotations are produced by
a stochastic process. This result is consistent with our conclu-
sion that even within the same object two diﬀerent processes –
stochastic and deterministic – may be responsible for diﬀerent
rotations. Furthermore, Blinov et al. (2015) argue that optical
EVPA swings and γ-ray activity are not necessarily physically
connected, but it is unlikely that none of the observed events are
connected. Particularly, the strongest γ-ray ﬂares had time lags
to EVPA rotations close to zero. They conclude there are two
processes: one producing strong γ-ray ﬂares and contemporane-
ous rotations of the optical polarization angle; the other produc-
ing moderate γ-ray ﬂares physically not connected to the optical
polarization activity, which may be coincident happening due
to a stochastic process. These results are consistent with ours.
Period IIIc is an example of a non-deterministic EVPA rotation
contemporaneous with strong γ-ray ﬂaring activity, whereas the
rotation during period IIa is probably due to a stochastic pro-
cess, potentially not connected to the moderate γ-ray variability.
Complementary to Blinov et al. (2015), we show that diﬀerent
processes responsible for the polarization variability can occur in
the same object. Additionally, we show that strong γ-ray ﬂaring
activity can occur without strong variability in the optical EVPA
(period I) and vice versa (period IVa–IVc).

6.3. Comparison with BL Lac and PKS 1510-089

3C 279, PKS 1510-089, and BL Lac are the most prominent
sources showing rotations of the optical EVPA and contempo-

raneous, strong γ-ray activity. The rotations in BL Lac in 2005
and in PKS 1510-089 in 2009 were explained by a determinis-
tic process, the motion of an emission feature on a spiral path
in a helical magnetic ﬁeld (Marscher et al. 2008, 2010). The
rotations in PKS 1510-089 in 2012, on the other hand, show-
ing several inversions of the rotation direction, were interpreted
as originating from a stochastic process (Aleksi´c et al. 2014b).
These events show some similarities but also diﬀerences in the
progression of the total optical ﬂux and the polarization fraction
during the rotation of the polarization angle.

The rotations in BL Lac in 2005 and in PKS 1510-089 in
2009 both start and end with a strong peak in the polarization
fraction (Marscher et al. 2008, 2010). The 380 ◦ and 250 ◦ ro-
tations in PKS 1510-089 in 2012 do not exhibit as pronounced
peaks, but indicate maxima in the polarization fraction in the be-
ginning and end of the rotation and a minimum during the event
(Aleksi´c et al. 2014b). The rotation in 3C 279 during period IIIc
also starts and ends with pronounced peaks in the polarization
fraction, though in contrast it shows an increasing trend through-
out the event underlying multiple extrema. This increasing trend
of the polarization fraction with a sharp drop at the end of the
rotation is seen in all smooth rotation events, periods IIIa, IIIc,
IVa, IVb. In contrast, the erratic rotation in period IIa does not
show a global trend and no pronounced peak of the polarization
fraction at the end of the rotation. The beginning of the rotation
is not captured by observations.

All discussed rotation events in BL Lac and PKS 1510-089
and the period IIIc rotation in 3C 279 coincide with one or mul-
tiple peaks in the optical light curve and γ-rays, but there is no
obviously consistent shape of the curves. Periods IIa, IIIa, and
IVa–IVc in the data of 3C 279 show that rotations of the optical
polarization angle can happen without coinciding, strong vari-
ability in γ-rays.

7. Summary and conclusions
In connection to an intensive multi-wavelength campaign, we
have accumulated and combined multiple data sets of R-band
photometry and optical polarimetry measurements into well-
sampled ﬂux density and polarization curves of the γ-ray loud
quasar 3C 279 covering a period from Nov. 2008 to July 2012.
These data capture 3C 279 in an optical low-brightness state be-
tween Nov. 2009 and Aug. 2010, followed by an optical ﬂaring
state, which coincides with an increased γ-ray activity (Aleksi´c
et al. 2014a). We observe strong optical polarization variation
and EVPA rotations during both states. We have critically dis-
cussed the nπ-ambiguity and diﬀerent solutions to treat it and we
presented a method to estimate the quality of the data given the
time sampling and the observed rotation rates. We have shown
that the sparsely sampled EVPA variability reported by Abdo
et al. (2010) does not show a continuous, large rotation when ad-
ditional data is considered. Generally, we ﬁnd EVPA rotations
with both a clockwise and a counter-clockwise sense of rotation.
These multiple changes of the rotation direction observed in the
data eliminate all except perhaps the most geometrically com-
plex models, to explain the entire polarization variability.

Instead, we have tested whether or not the observed EVPA
rotations can be of stochastic origin using the smoothness of the
EVPA curve as a key indicator. To do this, we introduced the
EVPA variation estimator as a quantitative measure of the curve
smoothness. We simulated three diﬀerent processes based on
random walks in Stokes Q and U and found that all of them are
highly unlikely to produce a smooth ∼ 360 ◦ EVPA rotation as
observed during the period IIIc (the ﬂaring state), especially co-

inciding with the high polarization fraction mean and variation.
We conclude that the tested class of simplistic stochastic pro-
cesses based on emission cells that have a random and variable
magnetic ﬁeld orientation cannot produce the observed polar-
ization variation during the ﬂaring state of 3C 279. This result
challenges more sophisticated stochastic models such as the tur-
bulent extreme multi-zone model (TEMZ) (Marscher 2014).

However, in the low-brightness state (period IIa) the EVPA
variation is much more erratic than during the ﬂaring state and
has the characteristics of random walk processes. Hence, we ﬁnd
two diﬀerent states: the low-brightness state exhibits a compara-
bly low polarization fraction and erratic EVPA variation, possi-
bly consistent with stochastic variation; the ﬂaring state shows a
high polarization fraction and very smooth EVPA variation with
a continuous counter-clockwise rotation sense. We interpret this
result as two diﬀerent processes contributing to the polarization
variation in 3C 279. On the one hand, there probably exists
an underlying stochastic variation, which is visible in the low-
brightness, less polarized state. Any stochastic model naturally
explains the frequent changes of the rotation direction observed
during the corresponding period. On the other hand, during the
ﬂaring state a small, highly polarized region of the optical jet
dominates the total and the polarized ﬂux. The polarization vari-
ation in this small region is not produced by the class of stochas-
tic processes we tested. Yet, deterministic models are challenged
by multiple changes of the rotation direction observed even dur-
ing the ﬂaring period. For period IIIc we can certainly exclude
the bending jet scenario, which had been suggested by Aleksi´c
et al. (2014a), who observed only a part of this EVPA rotation,
which signiﬁcantly exceeds 180 ◦.

We have tested three simplistic random walk processes
against polarization data. Whereas these toy models neglect vari-
ous physical eﬀects, we have demonstrated ways to compare also
more sophisticated models statistically with polarization data.

Appendix A: EVPA ambiguity, consistency and

reliability

In the attempt to solve the nπ-ambiguity of the polarization an-
gle, we generally adjust EVPA curves applying Eq. (1), in the
following we call this method E1. Here, we introduce a second
method (E2) to assess the sampling quality and to test the relia-
bility of solving the phase wraps. E2 determines the median {·}
of the Nref previous data points as a reference for an EVPA data
point χi:

χi,ref =(cid:8)[χi−1−Nref , . . . , χi−1](cid:9) .

(A.1)

The data point χi is then shifted according to Eq. (1), where
χi,ref replaces χi−1. For Nref=1 method E2 is identical to E1.
For Nref>1 method E2 considers a longer time frame than E1
as reference for adjusting each data point. It is expected to be
less susceptible to outliers but less reliable for sparsely sampled
rotations.

Fig. A.1. Probability of the correct EVPA reconstruction using diﬀer-
ent numbers of reference points Nref (upper panel) and average consis-
tency levels (lower panel) over diﬀerent rotation rates dχ/dt.

The measured EVPA curve χobs

is the 180 ◦-modulo of
the intrinsic curve χintr. EVPA adjustment methods E1 and
E2 aim to reconstruct
the intrinsic EVPA variations from
the sampled EVPA curve. We call the probability that the
shapes of the adjusted and intrinsic EVPA curves are identical
P(χadj=χintr±n·180 ◦) (with n ∈ N) the reliability of each method.
In the following we test the reliability under various conditions.
Assuming a constant rotation rate ˙χ, constant time sampling
∆t, and no observational errors the EVPA curve is correctly re-
constructed if the sampled rotation ∆χ = ∆t· ˙χ < 180 ◦/(Nref +1).
Without observational noise Nref = 1 is the optimal choice allow-
ing the sparsest time sampling. For sampled rotations ∆χ < 60 ◦
methods E1 (Nref=1) and E2 (Nref≥2) may yield the same ad-
justed EVPA curve. We call the highest number of reference
points Ncons, for which all adjusted curves with Nref ≤ Ncons are
identical, the consistency level:

Nconst = max{N ∈ N≥1 : χadj,(Nref =1) = χadj,(Nref =i) ∀ i ≤ N}.

(A.2)

Assuming minimal variation between measured data points,
the consistency level allows one to estimate the reliability of the
EVPA curve reconstruction.

We determine the expected reliability of the EVPA adjust-
ment (E1 and E2) and the expected consistency level for various
intrinsic rotation rates given the time sampling and observational
errors of our combined polarization data. We simulate linearly
increasing EVPA curves up to a total amplitude of 360 ◦ with
random time sampling and random errors as in the random walk
models (c.f. section 4) with model parameters given in Table 3,
row ’total’. The upper panel of Fig. A.1 shows the probability
of correctly reconstructing the intrinsic EVPA variation for var-
ious intrinsic rotation rates and diﬀerent numbers of reference
points. Method E1 (Nref=1) is the most reliable for rotation rates
˙χ ≥ 3 ◦/d, increasing Nref reduces the reliability. For intrinsic
rotation rates ˙χ ≤ 3 ◦/d the reliability is ∼ 98 %. In the lower
panel of Fig. A.1 we show the expectation value and standard
deviation of the consistency level for diﬀerent intrinsic rotation
rates. High consistency rates Ncons (cid:38) 10 indicate low intrinsic
variation ˙χ ≤ 3 ◦/d and a high probability ∼ 98 % of correct
curve reconstruction.

Given the time sampling and typical uncertainties of our po-
larization data, method E2 does not improve the reliable recon-

both methods E1 and E2 and the consistency level allows us to
estimate the quality of the time sampling and the reliability of
the reconstructed EVPA curve.

Appendix B: Variation estimator biases
We have deﬁned a quantitative measure of the smoothness of the
EVPA curve in section 3.2. This variation estimator measures
the average, short time-scale (shorter than the analysed data total
time), erratic rotation rate of the EVPA corrected for an assumed,
underlying, secular trend at the time-scale of the analysed data
total time. The measured variation estimator is increased (a) by
measurement errors, introducing additional variation, and (b) by
curvature of the underlying smooth variation, i.e. a non-constant
trend.

Intrinsic EVPA variation and measurement errors indepen-
dently add to the variation estimator. The de-biased variation
estimator is given by:

The upper panel shows exemplary power law curves with
increasing curvature, i.e. power law index α from 1 (red) to 10 (blue).

distribution

For constant measurement uncertainties σχ and even time
sampling ∆t, the error bias of the variation estimator is sbias ∝
σχ/∆t. Equation (B.1) also holds for variable σχ, but then we
need to estimate sbias through simulations, which is how the val-
ues in Table 2 were estimated. The uncertainty of the de-biased
variation estimator is equal to the uncertainty of the error bias.

When calculating the variation estimator s, the local deriva-
tive is corrected for (intrinsic) ﬁrst order rotations, i.e. constant
rotation rates, by subtracting a trend ¯χt. For higher order (i.e.
curved) intrinsic rotation curves the variation estimator will be
biased depending on the curvature. We test this dependency by
simulating EVPA curves (without errors) that follow a power law
over time:

with χmax the EVPA at time T equal to the total rotation ampli-
tude during the total time interval T and with α ≥ 1 the power
law index. Example curves for α = 1, 2,··· , 10 are shown in the
upper panel of Fig. B.1.

The trend ¯χt estimates the total rotation rate given by ∆χ

T with an accuracy of 1 %. The curvature biased variation
estimator is given by the curvature factor fs (plotted in the lower
panel of Fig. B.1) and the total rotation rate ∆χ

trend ¯χt:

scurve = fs · ∆χ

≈ fs · ¯χt.

(B.3)

Equation (B.3) with the simulation result shown in Fig. B.1
allows us to estimate the impact of a curved, underlying, smooth
variation of the EVPA onto the variation estimator. Correcting
the variation estimator for higher order variation would require
ﬁtting the EVPA curve and subtracting the ﬁt from the local
derivatives. To avoid a priori ﬁtting an arbitrary function to the
data we stick to the criterion that a linear trend is considered
smooth variation and any deviation from that linear trend con-
tributes to the variation estimator.

We deﬁne an algorithm to automatically identify EVPA rotations
in a polarization curve based on strictly ﬁxed criteria. We use
this algorithm on polarization curves simulated with our random
walk processes to characterize the EVPA rotation amplitude dis-
tribution expected from a stochastic process.

Appendix C.1: EVPA rotation identiﬁcation algorithm
We deﬁne the start and end point of an EVPA rotation by a
change of the rotation direction, i.e. a sign change of the deriva-
tive of the EVPA curve. We do not consider a change of the
rotation rate. We deﬁne the rotation amplitude as the diﬀerence
of the (local) extrema: |∆χ| = χmax − χmin. We call a rotation
between two data points χi, χ j signiﬁcant when the amplitude
is larger than the root summed squared errors of the two data
points multiplied with a factor ς that characterizes the signiﬁ-
cance level:

The algorithm identiﬁes signiﬁcant rotations by iterating point-
wise through the data. The storage contains all identiﬁed, sig-
niﬁcant EVPA rotations. The current rotation contains all data
points between the end of the last signiﬁcant rotation and the data
point previous to the current one. The rotation amplitude, direc-
tion and signiﬁcance characterize the current rotation. They are
calculated from the minimum and maximum value and the cor-
responding uncertainties. The data point of the current iteration
step and the previous one make the new rotation.

Based on the direction and signiﬁcance of the new, current,
and last stored rotation we deﬁne eleven states and correspond-
ing operations in Table C.1. Five quantities deﬁne each state:
the signiﬁcance of the current and the new rotation (Y/N, col. 2
and 3), whether the current rotation changes its direction or not
(+/-, col. 5), whether the current rotation becomes signiﬁcant
by adding the new, current data point(Y/N, col. 4), and how the
newly signiﬁcant rotation is oriented regarding to the previously
stored rotation (+/-, col. 6). States 6 and 9 may occur only once
when no signiﬁcant rotation has been found yet and the rotation
direction cannot be compared to a previous rotation (n/a). This

Two populations of identiﬁed rotations contribute to this distri-
bution: rotations consisting of two data points only, Ndp=2, and
rotations containing more than two data points, Ndp>2. The rota-
tion amplitude distributions of the populations are shown as red
and blue curves, respectively.

Both distributions peak at a certain value, show a sharp de-
cline towards smaller amplitudes and a long tail towards larger
amplitudes. However, because of the nπ-ambiguity the two-data-
point-population distribution is cut oﬀ at ∼ 90 ◦. Slightly larger
rotation amplitudes than 90 ◦ are possible due to EVPA errors.
The shortest simulation time step and the limits of the tested
parameter space (cell number and cell variation rate) aﬀect the
low-amplitude tail of the distributions.

When the cell variation rate increases (relative to the num-
ber of cells) the EVPA variation becomes more erratic and large,
continuous rotations become less likely. The distribution shifts
towards smaller rotation amplitudes. When the number of cells
is reduced the EVPA variation becomes more erratic and the
EVPA uncertainty is lower as the average polarization fraction is
increased. As a result, two-data-point rotations are more likely
to be signiﬁcant and the number of these rotations increases,
whereas the number of small rotation consisting of multiple data
points decreases.

Though not shown here, the signiﬁcance level ς used in
the rotation identiﬁcation strongly aﬀects the number of identi-
ﬁed rotations and the rotation amplitude distribution. For larger
ς two-data-point-rotations are less likely to be signiﬁcant and
therefore the number of identiﬁed rotation tends to be lower, and
rotation amplitudes tend to be larger compared to a lower choice
of ς.

niﬁcant at a predeﬁned level. Each pair of adjacent identiﬁed

local, insigniﬁcant maxima and minima.

Appendix C.2: Random walk EVPA rotation distribution
We run random walk simulations for various cell numbers and
cell variation rates with a total time T =100 000 d and the other
parameters chosen as in Table 3, period “total”. We adjust the
EVPA curve with Eq. (1) and identify signiﬁcant rotations at a
signiﬁcance level ς=3. In Fig. C.1 we show four examples of
EVPA rotation amplitude distributions based on the siQU ran-
dom walk process with diﬀerent numbers of cells and cell vari-
ation rates. The grey ﬁlled region displays the full distribution.
