In metallic condensed matter systems two diﬀerent types of Weyl fermions can in principle emerge,
with either a vanishing (type-I) or with a ﬁnite (type-II) density of states at the Weyl node energy.
So far only WTe2 and MoTe2 were predicted to be type-II Weyl semi-metals. Here we identify
TaIrTe4 as a third member of this family of topological semi-metals. TaIrTe4 has the attractive
feature that it hosts only four well-separated Weyl points, the minimum imposed by symmetry.
Moreover, the resulting topological surface states – Fermi arcs connecting Weyl nodes of opposite
chirality – extend to about 1/3 of the surface Brillouin zone. This large momentum-space separation
is very favorable for detecting the Fermi arcs spectroscopically and in transport experiments.

Weyl fermions are massless chiral fermions with a fun-
damental role in quantum ﬁeld theory and high-energy
physics[1]. In low-energy condensed matter systems Weyl
fermions can emerge as quasiparticles:
in semi-metals
with either broken time-reversal symmetry or inversion
symmetry, they can appear at the crossing point of two
linearly dispersing three-dimensional bands[2–4]. These
Weyl nodes and their chirality are protected by the sym-
metry of the semi-metal and the topology of its electronic
band structure. As a consequence Weyl semi-metals
(WSMs) host topologically protected surface states in the
form of open arcs – Fermi arcs – terminating at the pro-
jection of bulk Weyl points (WPs) of opposite chirality.
Other physical consequences in WSMs are exotic trans-
port phenomena such as a large negative magnetoresis-
tance with unusual anisotropy[5].

Very recently it was pointed out that whereas in high-
energy physics there is only one kind of Weyl fermion, in
condensed matter systems there are two, and not more
than two, types of WPs[6]. In a type-I WSM the bulk
Fermi surface shrinks to a point at the Weyl node whereas
in a type-II WSM the Weyl cone arises as a connector
of hole and electron pockets, where the large tilt of the
cone induces a ﬁnite density of states at the node energy.
This fundamental diﬀerence can for instance cause an
anomalous Hall eﬀect in type-II WSMs[6, 7]. The type-I
Weyl fermion corresponds to the one also encountered in
high-energy physics, but the type-II WP does not have an
high-energy equivalent as it breaks Lorentz invariance –
which of course not forbidden in a low-energy condensed
matter setting.

A number of type-I WSMs have been predicted theo-
retically [2, 3, 8–10]. The ﬁrst experimental indication
for the presence of Weyl points and Fermi arcs has been
established in a class of TaAs compounds[11–13] using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) –

even if the large number of WPs (24) makes the inter-
pretation of spectroscopic and transport data quite com-
plicated in these TaAs-based systems. Type-II WSMs
are very sparse at the moment – this category has
barely been explored and only two potential materi-
als, orthorhombic WTe2 and MoTe2 have been identiﬁed
theoretically[6, 14, 15]. Here we identify the orthorhom-
bic ternary compound TaIrTe4 as a third type-II WSM.
Based on calculations of its electronic structure and topo-
logical properties, we predict that TaIrTe4 hosts only
four type-II WPs, the minimal number of WPs a sys-
tem with time-reversal invariance can host[15]. The WPs
are very well separated from each other in momentum-
space: topological Fermi arcs that connect WPs of oppo-
site chirality extend to about 1/3 of the surface Brillouin
zone, and are present on both inequivalent surface ter-
minations. Such a large momentum-space separation is
conducive for easy detection of the Fermi arcs in spec-
troscopy experiments and as well as to resolve their con-
tribution to transport.

We performed density functional (DFT) calculations
within the local density approximation[16] using the
full-potential
local-orbital code (FPLO)[17]. For the
Brillouin zone (BZ) integration we used the tetrahdron
method with a 12 × 6 × 6 k-mesh. Scalar relativistic cal-
culations (without spin orbit coupling (SOC)) and full 4-
component relativistic calculations (including SOC) were
performed. For easier analysis, a model has been ex-
tracted using maximally projected Wannier functions
(WFs) for the Ta 5d, Ir 5d and Te 5p orbitals. The result-
ing (high accuracy) model reproduces the band energies
of all occupied bands and unoccupied bands up to 1 eV
above the Fermi level accurately. For faster evaluation
of all subsequent calculations the real space extent of the
WFs has been reduced resulting in a model which shows
some deviations of up to 10 meV around and slightly be-

tellurides, the similarities of the TaIrTe4 bandstructure
compared to MoTe2 and WTe2 should not be overemp-
hazised, since the Fermi surfaces are quite diﬀerent. Fig-
ure 1c shows the band structure along the line ΓX with-
out and with SOC. The band shown in red forms the top
of the valence band.
It gives rise to three dimensional
hole pockets along the line ΓX. Upon inclusion of SOC,
all bands split almost everywhere, which leads to two
nested but not touching hole pockets (Fig. 1b, labeled 1
and 2). The conduction bands around the Γ-point form
two electron pockets (labeled 4 and 5) which exhibit a
noticeable two-dimensional character in kz-direction in
contrast to the hole pockets. In contrast to MoTe2 and
WTe2, the hole and electron character of the pockets are
interchanged in TaIrTe4. Note, that pockets 4 and 5 have
open Fermi surfaces across the ky = ±π BZ boundaries
for kz = ±π. This feature is absent in the reduced WF
model at E = 0 eV but reemerges 8 meV above the Fermi
level. Additionally, small hole pockets (Fig. 1b, label 3)
occur at the ky = ±π planes. Another notable diﬀer-
ence to MoTe2 and WTe2 is the fact that the top of the
valence band crosses the bottom of the conduction band
close to the Γ-point along the line ΓX in TaIrTe4.

Despite the diﬀerence in the hole/electron nature of
the pockets, TaIrTe4 has similarities in its topological
properties compared to the two binary tellurides. Due to
symmetry conditions Weyl points can only occur in the
kz = 0 plane[6, 15]. Without SOC we ﬁnd 8 (spinless)
Weyl points between the topmost valence band N and
the lowest conduction band N + 1. Each quadrant of
the kx, ky-plane contains two such points with opposite
chern number C. The one with negative chirality (WP1)
recides in the hole pocket around kx = 0.1178, while the
one with positive chirality (WP2) resides in the electron
pocket around kx = 0.0483 (see Table I and Fig. 2).

With SOC, the spin doubled Weyl points get split and
moved around and due to the strength of the SOC, pairs
of WP2 with opposite chirality annihilate in the pro-
cess. Of the spin doubled Weyl points WP1 only a single
point (WP) survives per quadrant which results in a to-
tal of 4 Weyl points in the BZ if SOC is included. Two
WP with opposite chirality sit in the hole pocket around
kx = 0.1237 resulting in zero chern number for the hole
pocket.
It is interesting to note that WP1 and WP2
(without SOC) are type I Weyl points (see supplemen-
tary materials) while WP (with SOC) is type-II.

low the Fermi level, especially oﬀ the kz = 0 plane. These
deviations of the reduced model slightly change the Fermi
surface (FS) especially for E = 0 eV but not in the im-
portant BZ region. We have checked that all topological
properties are present in the accurate WF model as well.
TaIrTe4 crystallizes in a non-centrosymmetric or-
thorhombic structure with space group 31 (Pmn21)[18].
The lattice constants are a = 3.77 ˚A, b = 12.421 ˚A and
c = 13.184 ˚A. The unit cell contains 4 formula units
which form two layers of distorted corner sharing octahe-
dra. This compound has the same space group as MoTe2
and WTe2 but in contrast to those, the size of the unit
cell is doubled in the b-direction (Fig. 1a). A detailed
list of the Wyckoﬀ positions can be found in the supple-
mentary materials.

In order

to establish the topology of

the elec-
tronic structure, we implemented the calculation of the
Berry curvature F (k) = ∇k × A (k) with A (k) =
−i(cid:104)uk | ∇kuk(cid:105) into FPLO following the method of Ref.

rounding the Weyl point. Here, we applied the tech-
nique of choosing a small sphere around the WP such
that bands N and N + 1 are separated by a gap all over
the sphere[6, 15]. The results are summarized in Table I.

topologically protected Fermi arcs are to be expected[6].
Figure 3 shows the (001)-surface Fermi surface (spectral
function) of an ideal semi inﬁnite slab. The spectral func-
tion was obtained via Green function recursion [20, 21]
by mapping the bulk WF Hamiltonian onto the slab ge-
ometry while neglecting any surface and relaxation in-
duced modiﬁcations to the Hamiltonian. Only part of
the surface BZ is shown to focus on the essential details.

a WP must be accompanied by another diﬀerent arc liv-
ing on the opposite surface. We choose two such surfaces
by chosing the natural cleavage plane between the octa-
hedral layers followed by a removal of either the upper
or lower semi inﬁnite half of the bulk. The upper and
lower panel of Fig. 3 show the evolution of the spec-

tral function of the (001)- and(cid:0)001(cid:1)-surface, respectively,

while increasing the energy from the bulk Fermi level
at 0 meV to the WP energy 82.7 meV. At 0 meV the
spectral function of the (001)-surface shows the two hole
pockets 1 and 2 (Fig. 1), containing the WP, as well as
the hole pocket 3 and electron pockets 4 and 5 (around
kx = 0.05). Additionally, two trivial SO-split surface
states (SS) emerge out of the electron pockets running
parallel to ky at kx ≈ 0.07. The high intensity feature
at the left side of the hole pockets marked by the ar-
row is the precursor of the Fermi arc, which will develop
with increasing energy. At 0 meV, it is submerged into
the bulk projected bands (BPB). At 50 meV the electron
pockets form open FSs along the ky-direction while the
hole pockets shrink to such an extent that the Fermi arc
is separated from the BPB forming a true SS. Yet, still
the hole pockets are open across the ky = 0 plane and
contain two WP with total Chern number zero, which
opens the possibility of the arc being absorbed into the
BPB due to perturbations. There is however no prohi-
bition for an arc to be attached to a FS with zero total
chern number[22].

This changes at a critical energy (E = 79.2 meV) at
which hole pocket 1 is collapsed and pocket 2 gets sepa-
rated into two distinct closed pockets containing WPs of
opposite chirality. At this stage the Fermi arc should be
protected against perturbations. If the energy is raised
to the WP energy, hole pocket 2 remains of ﬁnite size and
has connected to the electron pocket at the coordinates
of the Weyl point, which shows the WP to be type-II.
Note, how the Fermi arc is following the ﬂux lines of the
Berry curvature (Fig. 2b).

The lower row of Fig. 3 depicts the (cid:0)001(cid:1)-surface FS

for the same set of energies. The noticeable diﬀerences
with respect to the other surface are the absence of the
ky-parallel SS and the emergence of the state connect-
ing the hole pockets with the electron pockets marked

bands was calculated over the whole BZ followed by an
integration over kz which results in the averaged Berry
curvature projected onto the kx, ky-plane. The resulting
ﬂux picture is shown in Fig. 2 without SOC (a) and with
SOC (b) (Note, that only half the extent of the BZ in
kx-direction is shown). With the sign choice of the Berry
connection, the sinks of the ﬂux have C = −1 and ﬂux
sources have C = 1. The monopoles at the Weyl points
are clearly visible and lay well within the kz = 0-cuts of
the E = 0 bulk FS (solid lines). It is also obvious that
there are no other Weyl points between bands N and
N + 1.

There certainly are additional topological features in
the bandstructure such as line nodes on the kx, kz-plane
as well as Weyl points between diﬀerent sets of bands.
We will not discuss them in this work mainly due to the
fact that they will either be at energies further away form
the Fermi energy or fall into the bulk band projections.
The Weyl points identiﬁed above give rise to topologi-
cally protected surface states.
In our case the projection
of the Weyl points onto the (001)-direction, map single
distinct WPs onto points in the surface BZ, in which case

by the arrow. This state evolves with increasing energy
such that the point where it connects to the hole pocket
moves closer to the WP, ﬁnally emerging exactly out of
the Weyl point at WP energy. At E = 79.2 meV it can
be best seen that this state is also a Fermi arc only that
it does not connect two Weyl points in the same BZ as
the arc on the other surface. It rather connects two such
points in adjacent BZs via immersion into the electron
bulk states (see supplementary materials for further elu-
cidation.) At the WP energy it is not a free standing arc
anymore, due to it forming a surface resonance at the
edge of the electron pocket. We checked thatthese arc
features even survive the enormous perturbation intro-
duced by cleaving the cell in the middle of the octahedral
layer such that the surface is terminated by an unsatu-
rated transition metal layer. A slew of bond breaking
related surface states appear in such a scenario. Yet the
arcs remain, especially at energies between 50 and 82.7
meV.

further illustrated in the supplementary material.

In summary we have demonstrated via DFT methods
that the ternary compound TaIrTe4 is a type-II Weyl
semi-metal with the simplest possible arrangement of
Weyl points under the symmetry constraints of the com-
pound. Topological Fermi arcs are present on both of the
surfaces of a naturally cleaved ideal semi inﬁnite slab, as

well as for other surface terminations. The length of the
emerging Fermi arc of the (001)-surface is about 1/3 of
the BZ extent in b-direction. The energy range in which
the Fermi arcs should be detectable reaches from 50 meV
to 82 meV above the Fermi level. All three telluride com-
pounds show at least the minimum set of 4 Weyl points,
occurring at very similar positions in k-space. This seems
to indicate that the existence of these particular Weyl
points are a generic feature in this family of compounds,
and it is therefore likely that slight modiﬁcations of the
band ﬁlling (i.e. doping) can be used to bring the the
bulk Weyl points and the surface arcs connecting them

at or even below the Fermi level where ARPES can re-
solve them.
