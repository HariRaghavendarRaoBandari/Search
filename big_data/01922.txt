REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS TO TIME-HARMONIC
MAXWELL’S SYSTEM WITH VARIOUS LOWER THAN

LIPSCHITZ COEFFICIENTS

BASANG TSERING-XIAO AND WEI XIANG

Abstract. In this paper, we study the regularity of the solutions of
the time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations in a bounded domain in several
cases. All the assumptions on the regularity of the coeﬃcients are less
than Lipschitz. We ﬁrst develop a new approach by giving H1 estimate
when the coeﬃcients are L∞ bounded; and then we derive W 1,p esti-
mates for every p > 2 when one of the leading coeﬃcients is simply
continuous; Finally, we obtain C1+α estimates when the coeﬃcients are
W 1,p for every p > 3. The last two estimates are new, and the technics
and methods developed here can also be applied to other problems with
similar diﬃculties.

Key Words: Maxwell’s equations; weak regularity; anisotropic;

1. Introduction

Let Ω ⊂ R3 be an open bounded domain1. The time-harmonic electro-

magnetic ﬁeld (E, H) ∈ Hloc (curl; Ω), where for any domain Ω we deﬁne

Hloc (curl; Ω) :=(cid:8)u ∈ L2

satisﬁes the Maxwell’s equations

where ε and µ are real matrix-valued functions in L∞(cid:0)R3(cid:1)3×3, the terms

Jm, Je ∈ L2(Ω) are current sources and the boundary condition G is in
Hloc(curl; Ω). We assume that ε−1(x) and µ−1(x) are real, uniformly positive
deﬁnite and bounded, that is , there exist 0 < λ1 ≤ λ2 < ∞ and 0 < λ3 ≤
λ4 < ∞ such that for all ξ ∈ R3 and almost every x ∈ R3,

λ1|ξ|2 ≤ ε−1(x)ξ · ξ ≤ λ2|ξ|2,
λ3|ξ|2 ≤ µ−1(x)ξ · ξ ≤ λ4|ξ|2.

The goal of this paper is to study the regularity of the electromagnetic
ﬁelds with low regularity assumptions on the material parameters. The ma-
terial parameters are (ε(x), µ(x)) which are the matrix valued coeﬃcients of
Maxwell’s equations, and the importance of the low regularity assumptions
on the coeﬃcients lies in the consideration of the corresponding medium

number.

with complicated structure, such as liquid crystals. This study is originally
motivated by the study of the electromagnetic inverse problems for liquid
crystals, see [4] in which we study the molecular structure which represented
by the coeﬃcients of Maxwell’s equations of liquid crystals by means of the
optical measurement which can be given by a formulation of the solutions
of Maxwell’s equations. The question of whether the data measured is well
understood in the sense of the object observed is of paramount importance
in this context. There are some work have been done recently in this con-
sideration; Ball, Capdeboscq and Tsering-xiao [2] studied the uniqueness
of the solutions of Maxwell’s equations under the low regularity assump-
tions on the coeﬃcients, and later Capdeboscq and Tsering-xiao [3] studied
the reconstruction of the speciﬁc properties of the coeﬃcients using optical
measurement of laser beam.

The regularity of the solutions of Maxwell’s equations has been studied by
many people, see [7–10] for more detail. In the case of the high regularity as-
sumptions on the coeﬃcients, Leis [11] established well-posedness in H1(Ω)
when the coeﬃcients are smooth matrices where H1(Ω) is the Sobolev space
and later Costabel [12] showed the C1 regularity for C1,1 domain. However,
Alberti and Capdeboscq [1] is the only work so far that studied the regular-
ity of the solutions with low regularity assumptions on the coeﬃcients. In
this paper, we extend the regularity results given in [1] in the case of real
coeﬃcients. We study the regularity and improve the results obtained in [1]
encompasses three aspects: diﬀerent approach, similar regularity results un-
der weaker regularity assumptions on the coeﬃcients, and better regularity
results for the solutions under the same regularity assumptions. Speciﬁ-
cally, we work on the system of Maxwell’s equations instead of studying the
deduced scalar elliptic equations of second order as done in [1]. We ﬁrst de-
velop the approach through giving the H1 estimates for the solutions when
the coeﬃcients are bounded; Based on the H1 estimates, we derive W 1,p
estimates for H for every p > 2 when the coeﬃcients ε is simply continuous
and µ ∈ W 1,p for every p > 3; This result is not addressed in the literature,
since one of the coeﬃcients is simply continuous. Finally, we obtain C1+α
estimates for the solution H in the case of both homogeneous and inhomo-
geneous equations when µ ∈ W 1,p, p > 3 and ε ∈ C α. The C 1+α estimate is
one of the most important results in this paper, which is the best regularity
result for the solutions so far when the regularity of the coeﬃcients are less
than Lipschitz.

Based on the regularity results of H and taking into account the symmet-
ric structure of the equations, we can easily derive the interior estimates of
the solution E. However, the boundary conditions of E and H are diﬀerent,
so it is necessary to use a diﬀerent approach to derive the boundary esti-
mates for E. By developing a diﬀerent approach for the boundary estimates
of E, we obtain the exact same regularity for E and H if we give the same
assumptions on the coeﬃcients ε and µ respectively.

Section 3 gives the proofs of the results given in Section 2. Each of
the proofs is made of two main parts, of which the ﬁrst part consists of
the properties and proofs corresponding to the homogeneous case and the
second part is the proof of each theorem given in Section 2.

2. Main results

We investigate the regularity of the solutions of the equation (1.1) with
inhomogeneous boundary conditions. We ﬁrst consider the regularity of H,
and the equation that H satisﬁes can be written as follows

(2.1)

and

(2.2)

∇ ∧ (ε−1(x)∇ ∧ H) = k2

1µ(x)H − k2Jm + ∇ ∧ (ε−1(x)Je) ,

div(µ(x)H) = k3divJm ,

where the constants k2

1 = ω2ε0µ0, k2 = iωε0, and k3 = i/(ωµ0).

Theorem 1 (H1 regularity). Let µ(x) ∈ W 1,3+δ(Ω)3×3, where δ > 0. Sup-
pose ε−1(x) ∈ L∞(Ω)3×3 and satisﬁes (1.2). If H is a weak solutions of
equations (2.1) and (2.2), then H ∈ H1(Ω) and

||H||H1(Ω) ≤C(||∇ ∧ G||L2(Ω) + ||Jm||L2(Ω) + ||divJm||L2(Ω)

+ ||H||L2(Ω) + ||Je||L2(Ω) + ||(Jm − ∇ ∧ G) · ν||

H

).

Remark 2. The result given in Theorem 1 is same with the result addressed
in Theorem 1 in Alberti and Capdeboscq [1], however we derive the result
by developing a new approach. We obtain subsequent new regularity results
given in the following theorems based the approach developed in this theorem.

Based on the H1-regularity, by applying the Stampacchia interpolation
theorem, we derive the W 1,p estimate of H for every p ≥ 2 and the coeﬃcient
ε−1(x) is assumed to be simply continuous.

Theorem 3 (W 1,p regularity). Let µ(x) ∈ W 1,3+δ(Ω)3×3, where δ > 0.
Suppose ε−1(x) ∈ C0(Ω)3×3 is a positive deﬁnite matrix.
If H is a weak
solutions of equations (2.1) and (2.2), then H ∈ W 1,p(Ω) for every p ≥ 2
and
||H||W 1,p(Ω) ≤C(||∇ ∧ G||Lp(Ω) + ||Jm||Lp(Ω) + ||divJm||Lp(Ω)

+ ||H||Lp(Ω) + ||Je||Lp(Ω) + ||(Jm − ∇ ∧ G) · ν||

),

where 1

p + 1

q = 1.

Remark 4. To produce the same regularity result, we assume that ε−1(x) is
simply continuous and µ(x) ∈ W 1,3+δ(Ω)3×3 while Theorem 3 in [1] assumes
that both µ(x) and ε(x) are in W 1,3+δ(Ω)3×3.

Now we extend the results and give C1,α-regularity of H provided that

ε−1(x) is H¨older continuous.

Theorem 5 (C1,α regularity). Let µ(x) ∈ W 1,3+δ(Ω)3×3, where δ > 0.
Suppose ε−1(x) ∈ Cβ(Ω)3×3 is a positive deﬁnite matrix. If H is a weak
solutions of equations (2.1) and (2.2), then there exists α > 0 such that

||H||C1,α(Ω) ≤C(||∇ ∧ G||Cα(Ω) + ||Jm||Cα(Ω) + ||divJm||Cα(Ω)

+ ||H||L2(Ω) + ||Je||Cα(Ω) + ||Jm − ∇ ∧ G||C1,α(Ω)).

REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS WITH LOW REGULARITY COEFFICIENTS

Remark 6. The assumptions on the coeﬃcients made in Theorem 5 are
same with the assumptions made in the main theorems given in [1], while
the regularity results for the solution given in the literature are all W 1,p.
Therefore, the C1,α we obtained here is the ﬁrst regularity result for the
solutions under the assumptions.

As above regularity properties, we also derive the regularity properties for
the electrical ﬁeld E when the coeﬃcients are given the same assumptions
as written in above theorems.

Theorem 7 (Regularity for E). Let ε(x) ∈ W 1,3+δ(Ω)3×3, where δ > 0.
Suppose the condition (1.2) holds, and if E is a weak solutions of the equa-
tions (1.1), then E ∈ H1(Ω) and

||E||H1(Ω) ≤ C(||E||L2(Ω)+||∇∧G||L2(Ω)+||Je||L2(Ω)+||Jm||L2(Ω)+||divJe||L2(Ω)).

Moreover, if µ−1(x) ∈ C0(Ω)3×3 and satisﬁes the condition (1.2), then the
following inequality holds
(2.3)
||E||W 1,p(Ω) ≤ C(||E||L2(Ω)+||∇∧G||Lp(Ω)+||Je||Lp(Ω)+||Jm||Lp(Ω)+||divJe||Lp(Ω)),

where p ≥ 2 and the constant C does not depend on the solutions E; If
µ−1(x) ∈ Cβ(Ω)3×3, then there exists α ∈ (0, 1) such that
(2.4)
||E||C1,α(Ω) ≤ C(||E||L2(Ω)+||∇∧G||Cα(Ω)+||Je||Cα(Ω)+||Jm||Cα(Ω)+||divJe||Cα(Ω)).

Remark 8. Clearly, if we exchange the role of ε(x) and µ(x), then the
arguments given in the above theorems can be easily applied to derive the
regularity of E. But we would like to remark that the electrical ﬁeld E
and the magnetic ﬁeld H hold diﬀerent boundary conditions, hence we use
diﬀerent method to prove the boundary estimate of E.

We combine all the previous results together such that if µ(x) and ε(x)

are regular enough, then we can have the following general results.

Theorem 9 (Regularity for (E, H)). Let µ(x), ε(x) ∈ W 1,3+δ(Ω)3×3, where
δ > 0. Let ε(x) and µ(x) satisfy (1.2). Then the solutions E and H satisfy
the estimates
(2.5)

||E||C1,α(Ω) + ||H||C1,α(Ω)

≤C(||E||L2(Ω) + ||H||L2(Ω) + ||∇ ∧ G||Cα(Ω)

+ ||Je||Cα(Ω) + ||Jm||Cα(Ω) + ||divJe||Cα(Ω) + ||divJm||Cα(Ω) + ||Jm − ∇ ∧ G||C1,α(Ω)).

The proofs of the theorems are given in section 3.

3. Proof of the theorems

3.1. Proof of Theorem 1. To prove Theorem 1, we ﬁrst develop the same
regularity result for the homogeneous case, and we address it in the following
propositions. In another word, we ﬁrst make the structure of the equations
simpler to develop a better approach which also can be applied to the general
nonhomogeneous Maxwell’s equations.

Proposition 10. Let µ(x) ∈ W 1,3+δ(Ω)3×3, where δ > 0. Suppose ε−1(x) ∈
L∞(Ω)3×3 and that the condition (1.2) holds. If H is a weak solutions of
the following equations

∇ ∧ (ε−1(x)∇ ∧ H) = k2µ(x)H,

(3.1)
with the boundary condition (ε−1∇ ∧ H) ∧ ν = E ∧ ν = 0 on ∂Ω, then
H ∈ H1(Ω) and

div(µH) = 0

in Ω

||H||H1(Ω) ≤ C||H||L2(Ω).

Proof of Proposition 10. We ﬁrst show the estimate of ∇ ∧ H which can be
proved by the simple energy estimate as follows.

Step 1. Estimates of ∇ ∧ H. Multiply both sides of the equation (3.1)

by H, and integrate it by parts, we get that

ZΩ

ε−1(x)(∇ ∧ H) · (∇ ∧ H)dx +Z∂Ω

((ε−1∇ ∧ H) ∧ ν) · Hdσ = k2ZΩ

Notice that (ε−1∇ ∧ H) ∧ ν = E ∧ ν = 0 on ∂Ω, and by applying the
condition (1.2), we obtain that

|µH|2dx.

ZΩ

|∇ ∧ H|2dx ≤ CZΩ

|H|2dx.

Step 2. Helmholtz decomposition. From Lemma 29 which listed in
the Appendix, H can be decomposed as H = ∇ϕ + ∇ ∧ A. Notice that
∇ ∧ (∇ ∧ A) = ∇ ∧ H, and div(∇ ∧ A) = 0, so
∇ ∧ A ∈ W 1,2(Ω) ,

provided if ∇ ∧ H ∈ L2(Ω). More precisely, we have the estimates

||∇ ∧ A||W 1,2(Ω) ≤ C(||∇ ∧ H||L2(Ω) + ||H||L2(Ω)) .

Next from the equation (3.1), we get that

k2div(µ∇ϕ + µ∇ ∧ A) = −div(∇ ∧ E) = 0 ,

hence ϕ satisﬁes the following elliptic equation

(3.2)

div(µ∇ϕ) = −div(µ∇ ∧ A)

in Ω .

On the boundary, the solutions satisﬁes that

div(E ∧ ν) = (∇ ∧ E) · ν = iwµ0(µH) · ν = 0 .

So

Then ϕ satisﬁes

0 = (µH) · ν = (µ∇ϕ + µ∇ ∧ A) · ν .

(3.3)

(µ∇ϕ) · ν = −(µ∇ ∧ A) · ν

on ∂Ω .

Multiply ϕ on both sides of the equation (3.2) and integrate it by part,

Z∂Ω

ϕ(µ∇ϕ)·νdσ−ZΩ

µ∇ϕ·∇ϕdx = −Z∂Ω

ϕ(µ∇∧A)·νdσ+ZΩ

µ∇∧A·∇ϕdx .

By employing the boundary condition (3.3), and the H¨older inequality, we
have that

||∇ϕ||L2(Ω) ≤ C||µ∇ ∧ A||L2(Ω) ≤ C||∇ ∧ H||L2(Ω) .

Step 3. Interior estimates. Let η be a smooth positive cut-oﬀ function
such that η ≡ 1 in Br and η = 0 on ∂BR. Then take derivatives ∂k on both
sides of the equation (3.2) and multiply η2∂kϕ. After an integration by part,
it gives that

Notice that

≤C(||µ||W 1,3(Ω) + ||µ||L∞(Ω))||∇ ∧ A||W 1,2(Ω).

Let ηi be cut-oﬀ functions such that the subregions {x ∈ Ω ; ηi(x) = 1} con-
sist of a ﬁnite cover of Ω, and diam{Ωi} ≤ R, where Ωi := {x ∈ Ω ; ηi(x) >
0}. Then when ǫ is small enough, we have

Again let ǫ and R be small enough, by using the embedding theorem ||µ||W 1,3(Ω)+
||µ||L∞(Ω) ≤ C||µ||W 1,3+δ (Ω) for any δ > 0,

|∇2ϕ|2dx ≤ C(||∇∧A||W 1,2(Ω)+||∇ϕ||L2(Ω)) ≤ C(||∇∧H||L2(Ω)+||H||L2(Ω)),

where the constant C depends on the norm ||µ||W 1,3+δ .

Step 4. Boundary estimates. Notice that ϕ is a solution of the conformal
derivatives problem of a scalar elliptic equation of second order, so one can
use the standard argument to derive the boundary estimates of the solutions.
More precisely, for any point x0 ∈ ∂Ω, we can introduce an orthogonal

REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS WITH LOW REGULARITY COEFFICIENTS

transformation of the coordinates,

y = Φ(x),

x = Ψ(y).

In the new coordinates y = (y1, y2, y3), and we deﬁne BR+(y0) := BR(y0) ∩
{y3 > 0}, where R > 0 and y0 = Φ(x0). Let ˜ϕ(y) = ϕ(Ψ(y)), and for the
simplicity, we write ϕ instead of ˜ϕ. Then ϕ satisﬁes the equation

(3.4)

div(˜µ∇ϕ) − ˜b · ∇ϕ = −div(¯µ∇x ∧ A) + ¯b · ∇x ∧ A,

where ∇x = (∂x1, ∂x2, ∂x3 ), ˜µkl = P3

(˜µ∇ϕ) · e3 = −(¯µ∇x ∧ A) · e3,

where e3 is the unit direction of y3-axis. Since the boundary ∂Ω is of C 1,1,
the coeﬃcient ˜µ and ¯µ have the same regularity as µ, while ˜b and ¯b are L∞
functions.

Again let η be a smooth positive cut-oﬀ function such that η ≡ 1 in
Br(y0) and η = 0 on ∂BR(y0). Then take the tangential derivatives ∂k,
where k = 1 or 2 on both sides of the equation (3.4) and multiply η2∂kϕ.
After an integration by part, it gives that

∂k(˜µ∇ϕ) · ∇(η2∂kϕ)dy +ZBR(y0)

˜b · ∇ϕ∂k(η2∂kϕ)dy

¯b · ∇x ∧ A∂k(η2∂kϕ)dy

Applying the boundary condition (3.5), we have that

∂k(˜µ∇ϕ) · e3 = −∂k(¯µ∇ ∧ A) · e3

on ∂Ω,

for k = 1 or 2. Therefore, the boundary terms vanish, and we can derive
the estimates of ∂k∇ϕ as done in Step 3. By applying the equation (3.2),
it is easy to see that ∂2
y3ϕ is bounded by ∂k∇ϕ for k = 1 or 2, and on the
boundary it still holds that

ZΩ∩BR(y0)

|∇2ϕ|2dx ≤ C(||∇ ∧ A||W 1,2(Ω∩BR(y0)) + ||∇ϕ||L2(Ω∩BR(y0)))

≤ C(||∇ ∧ H||L2(Ω∩BR(y0)) + ||H||L2(Ω∩BR(y0))).

Therefore we prove the H1-regularity of H as follows

||H||H1(Ω) ≤||∇(∇ϕ)||L2(Ω) + ||∇(∇ ∧ A)||L2(Ω)

≤C(||∇ ∧ H||L2(Ω) + ||H||L2(Ω))
≤C||H||L2(Ω).

Based on the new approach, we are now going to prove theorem 1 for the

non-homogeneous case.

Proof of theorem 1. Let

(3.6)
Obviously, ˜E and ˜H satisfy the system

˜E = E − G,

˜H = H.

(3.7)

where

∇ ∧ ˜E − i ωµ0µ(x) ˜H = ˜Jm
∇ ∧ ˜H + i ωε0ε(x) ˜E = ˜Je
˜E ∧ ν = 0

on ∂Ω.




˜Jm := Jm − ∇ ∧ G,
Then ˜H satisﬁes the equations

˜Je := Je − i ωε0ε(x) G in Ω.

∇ ∧ (ε−1(x)∇ ∧ ˜H) = k2

1µ(x) ˜H − k2 ˜Jm + ∇ ∧ (ε−1(x) ˜Je),

(3.8)

and

(3.9)
where the constants k2
boundary ∂Ω, ˜H satisﬁes that

div(µ(x) ˜H) = k3div ˜Jm = k3divJm,

1 = ω2ε0µ0, k2 = iωε0, and k3 = i/(ωµ0). On the

(3.10)

(ε−1∇ ∧ ˜H) ∧ ν = −iwε0 ˜E ∧ ν + ˜Je ∧ ν = ˜Je ∧ ν.

Multiply ˜H on both sides of equation (3.8) and integrate it by part, then

ε−1(x)(∇ ∧ ˜H) · (∇ ∧ ˜H)dx +Z∂Ω

=k2

((ε−1∇ ∧ ˜H) ∧ ν) · ˜Hdσ

(ε−1 ˜Je) · (∇ ∧ ˜H)dx +Z∂Ω

By the identity, it is easy to see that the following inequality holds:

( ˜Je ∧ ν) · ˜Hdσ.

||∇ ∧ ˜H||L2(Ω) ≤ C(|| ˜H||L2(Ω) + || ˜Je||L2(Ω) + || ˜Jm||L2(Ω)).

Next, let ˜H = ∇ϕ + ∇ ∧ A. Similar to the argument in Step 2 of the proof

of Proposition 10, we have that

||∇ ∧ A||H1(Ω) ≤ C(|| ˜H||L2(Ω) + || ˜Je||L2(Ω) + || ˜Jm||L2(Ω)),

and ϕ satisﬁes the following scalar elliptic equation of second order

div(µ∇ϕ) = −div(µ∇ ∧ A) + k3divJm.

Again as the argument in Step 3 of the proof of Proposition 10, we have

the interior estimates for any x0 ∈ Ω,

ZBr(x0)

|∇2ϕ|2dx ≤C(||∇ ∧ A||W 1,2(Ω) + ||Jm||W 1,2(Ω) + ||∇ϕ||L2(Ω))

≤C(||∇ ∧ ˜H||L2(Ω) + ||divJm||L2(Ω) + || ˜Jm||L2(Ω) + || ˜Je||L2(Ω) + || ˜H||L2(Ω)).

For the boundary estimates, as the argument in Step 4 of the proof of

Proposition 10, it is easy to prove that for any x0 ∈ ∂Ω,

(3.11)

ZBr∩Ω

|∇ ∧ ˜H|2dx ≤ C(R)ZBR∩Ω

Moreover, in the new y-coordinates introduced as in Step 4 of the proof of
Proposition 10, ϕ satisﬁes the equation

div(˜µ∇ϕ) − ˜b · ∇ϕ = −div(¯µ∇x ∧ A) + ¯b · ∇x ∧ A + k3divxJm,

with the boundary condition on {y3 = 0}

(˜µ∇ϕ) · e3 = −(¯µ∇x ∧ A) · e3 + k3 ˜Jm · e3.

Again following from the same argument given in Step 4 of the proof of

3.2. Proof of Theorem 3. As before, we develop the exact regularity re-
sults for the homogeneous equation before giving the proof of the theorem
(3). Notice that in the bounded domain Ω, ||H||Lp(Ω) ≤ ǫ||∇H||Lp(Ω) +
C||H||L2(Ω), so we only need to estimate ||∇H||Lp(Ω). We ﬁrst give the
following Lemma to estimate the solutions of elliptic equations with con-
stant coeﬃcients. For any x0 ∈ Ω, let 0 < R ≤ dist(x0, ∂Ω), and let
BR = BR(x0) := {x ; |x − x0| < R}.

Proposition 12. Let µ(x) ∈ W 1,3+δ(Ω)3×3, where δ > 0. Suppose H ∈
H1(Ω) is a weak solutions of the equations (3.1), where ε−1(x) ∈ C0(Ω)3×3
and satisﬁes the condition (1.2), then the following inequality holds

where the constant C does not depend on the solutions H.

) ≤ C||H||H1(BR),

Step 2. Boundary regularity. Let x0 ∈ ∂Ω, and by taking the assump-
tion ∂Ω is C1,1, we can always ﬁnd a ball B centred at x0 and an orthog-
onal coordinates transformation Φ ∈ C1,1(B; R3) such that (y1, y2, y3) =
(Φ1(x), Φ2(x), Φ3(x)), and that Φ(B ∩ Ω) = {y3 > 0} ∩ BR(0) in the new
coordinates. Let

˜E = (∇Φ)E,

˜ε = (∇Φ)ε(∇Φ)T ,

˜µ = (∇Φ)µ(∇Φ)T ,

then ˜E and ˜H satisfy the equation

(3.21)

( ˜∇ ∧ ˜E = iwµ0 ˜µ ˜H

˜∇ ∧ ˜H = −iwε0 ˜ε ˜E

where ˜∇ = (∂y1, ∂y2, ∂y3 ), and on the boundary {y3 = 0}, ˜E1 = ˜E2 = 0.
Therefore, the Maxwell’s equation can be written in the same form in the
new coordinates. Notice that ∇Φ ∈ W 1,∞ which assures that ˜ε and ˜µ satisfy
all the assumptions which ε and µ satisfy.

Using the half balls in place of the balls, we can follow the exact procedure
of Step 1 to derive the estimates near the boundary. One can treat the
boundary integration term as exactly same with we have done in the Step 1

REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS WITH LOW REGULARITY COEFFICIENTS

13

and Step 4 of the proof of Proposition 10. Hence we omit the details here,
and we refer [5] and [6] for more detail.

Step 3. Global regularity. After applying the interior estimates, boundary
estimates and the standard ﬁnite covering technique as well as the result of
Proposition 10, one can easily complete the proof of this theorem.

Step 4. The case that µ 6= Id3×3 .

In this step, we only consider the
interior estimate, since the boundary estimate can be derived as we have
done in the Step 4 of the proof of Proposition 10. From equation (3.17), we
know that

(3.22)

||∇ ∧ (ηH)||Lq(BR) ≤

where q = 2∗ = 6 > 2. Hence

||∇ ∧ A||W 1,q(Br) ≤ C(||∇ ∧ (ηH)||Lq(BR) + ||H||Lq(BR)) ≤

||H||H1(BR).

Follow the same argument as done in Step 2 of this proof to deduce the
inequality (3.17). Let ψ be the test function in Br, such that η ≡ 1 in Br1,
where 0 < r1 < r, then for any k = 1,· · · , 3,

ZBr(x0)

Similarly, for any k = 1, 2, or 3, we have

||∇(η∂kϕ)||Lq (Br) ≤C(||G||L2(Br) + ||F ||Lq(Br))

Hence it proves the inequality (3.19). Now we can follow the exact three
steps shown in the case of µ = Id3×3 to show that H satisﬁes the desired
W 1,p estimate.
(cid:3)

Next we give the proof of Theorem 3, in which we obtain the W 1,p estimate

for every p ≥ 2.

Proof of the theorem 3. Using the interpolation theorem, then one only needs
to prove that

||∇H||Lp(Ω) ≤ C(||H||L2(Ω)+||Je||Lp(Ω)+||∇∧G||Lp(Ω)+||Jm||Lp(Ω)+||divJm||Lp(Ω)).

REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS WITH LOW REGULARITY COEFFICIENTS

14

Let the terms ˜H, ˜E, ˜Je and ˜Jm be deﬁned as in the proof of theorem 1.
Then we only need to prove that

||∇ ˜H||Lp(Ω) ≤ C(|| ˜H||L2(Ω) + || ˜Je||Lp(Ω) + || ˜Jm||Lp(Ω) + ||div ˜Jm||Lp(Ω)).

It will be proved similarly as the proof of Proposition 12. Because of the
source terms, Gi and F α

Following the same argument as the proof to the estimate (3.17), we can
have the estimate of ∇ ∧ (ηH). At the same time, div(η ˜H) is estimated by
applying the technics developed in Step 4 of the proof of Proposition 12,
on equation (3.9), where the inhomogeneous terms are dealt as the proof of
theorem 1. Then we can easily obtain the W 1,p-estimates. Here we need to
use the following diﬀerent estimate to bound the integration on the boundary

3.3. Proof of Theorem 5. We ﬁrst develop the following theorem which
gives the C1,α regularity for the homogeneous Maxwell’s equations. We then
generalize the result from homogeneous to nonhomogeneous and give the
proof of the theorem 5. We use, in this part, the Campanato space which is
introduced in deﬁnition 22 in Appendix.

Proposition 13. Let µ(x) ∈ W 1,3+δ(Ω)3×3, where δ > 0. Suppose H ∈
H1(Ω) satisﬁes the equations (3.1), where ε−1(x) ∈ Cβ(Ω)3×3, then there
exists α ∈ (0, 1) such that

(3.23)

||H||C1,α(Ω) ≤ C||H||L2(Ω)

Before giving the proof, we require the results of the lemmas below and
the ﬁrst lemma is concerned with the local energy estimate of the solutions
with constant coeﬃcients.

Lemma 14. If V satisﬁes
(3.24) ∇ ∧ (ε−1(x0)∇ ∧ V ) = k2µ(x0)V

The next lemma is to absorb the error terms described by the small pa-

Φ(θR) ≤ 2AθnΦ(R) ≤ θνΦ(R).

Let us take k for any 0 < r < R, such that θ1+kR < r < θkR, then it follows
that

We omit the proof of this lemma since it is similar to the proof of Lemma

Proof of Proposition 13. We only consider the interior estimates, since we
can use the same argument in Step 2 and Step 3 of the proof of Proposition
12 to study the estimates on the boundary and the global regularity.

Step 1.[Case µ = Id]. Let W = H − V ∈ H1

0(BR(x0)), where V satisﬁes

the equation (3.24) and divV = 0. Then W satisﬁes the equation that

∇∧(cid:2)ε−1(x0)∇ ∧ W(cid:3) = k2µ(x0)W +k2(µ(x0)−µ(x))H+∇∧[(ε−1(x0)−ε−1(x))∇∧H].

satisﬁes the equation (3.24) and div(µ(x0)V ) = 0. Because the coeﬃcients

As shown in the previous proof, we get that

(3.41)

ZBR(x0)

|∇ ∧ W |2dx ≤ CR2αZBR(x0)

|∇ ∧ H|2dx.

Again let W = ∇ϕ + ∇ ∧ A, then ∂kϕ satisﬁes the equation
(3.42)
div(µ(x0)∇∂kϕ) = div((µ(x0)−µ(x))∂kH)+div(−∂kµH)−div(µ(x0)∂k(∇∧A)),

for any k = 1, 2, or 3. And ∇ ∧ A satisﬁes the estimate

||∂k(∇ ∧ A)||L2(BR) ≤ C||∇ ∧ W ||L2(BR) ≤ CR2αZBR(x0)

|∇ ∧ H|2dx.

By applying the standard energy estimate again, we have

where α depends on β and δ.

(cid:3)

Proof of theorem 5. We only need to repeat the proof of Proposition 13 by
adding the corresponding source terms and the boundary terms as done for
the proof of theorem 3. More precisely, let us ﬁrst consider the interior
estimates. Let W = H − V ∈ H1
0(BR(x0)), where V satisﬁes the equation
(3.24) and divV = 0, then we can have inequality (3.37) with the source

for any small ν > 0, and 0 < α < 1. So we can prove (3.43) and then (3.39)

For the boundary estimate, let V satisfy a modiﬁed problem

(3.46)

∇ ∧ ˜E − i ωµ0µ(x0) V = 0
∇ ∧ V + i ωε0ε(x0) ˜E = 0
˜E ∧ ν = 0

Then equivalently V is a solutions of the following equations

in Ω,

with the boundary condition

(3.49)

(ε−1(x0)∇ ∧ V ) ∧ ν = µ(x0)V · ν = 0

on ∂Ω.

By applying the Helmholtz decomposition to estimate the curl and div part
separately as before, we can following the ideas developed in the proof of
Lemma 14 and Step 2-4 of the proof of Proposition 10 to have that V actually
satisﬁes the following estimates

and

with the boundary condition on ∂Ω

and

First from equation (3.51) and boundary condition (3.53), we can follow
the argument in the proof of Proposition 13 to have (3.45), by applying the
technics developed in the proof of theorem 1 to deal with the boundary terms
and the source terms. Next from equation (3.52) and boundary condition
(3.54), we can follow the argument in Step 2 of the proof of Proposition 13

Because all the argument is similar, we omit the details here for brevity.
(cid:3)

3.4. Proof of theorem 7 and 9. Using the symmetric structure of the
system, we can show the similar estimate to the solutions E. However, one
needs to take care of the diﬀerent boundary condition, namely the solutions
E satisﬁes E ∧ ν = 0 on the boundary and H satisﬁes diﬀerent boundary
conditions derived from the boundary condition of E. Because the diﬀerence
between the proof in this subsection and the proof of the estimates of H in
the previous subsection comes from the diﬀerent boundary conditions, we
only consider the homogeneous problem to illustrate how to carefully derive
the boundary estimates of E. Then the estimates for the inhomogeneous
case can be done in a similar way. Precisely, the argument corresponding to
the boundary estimates is exactly the one in the proof of the propositions
in this subsection, and the argument corresponding to the inhomogeneous
source terms and the interior estimates is as the one to the proof of theorem
1–5 by the symmetry structure of the system. However the argument is very
long and tedious, so we omit the detail for the shortness.

The regularity results we developed for the solution E of the homogeneous

Maxwell’s equations are given as below.

Proposition 19 (Regularity for E–Homogeneous). Let ε(x) ∈ W 1,3+δ(Ω)3×3,
where δ > 0. Suppose the condition (1.2) holds. Suppose E is a weak solu-
tions of the following equations,

∇ ∧ (µ−1(x)∇ ∧ E) = k2ε(x)E,

(3.55)
with the boundary condition E ∧ ν = 0 on ∂Ω, then E ∈ H1(Ω) and

div(εE) = 0

in Ω

(3.56)

||E||H1(Ω) ≤ C||E||L2(Ω).

Moreover, if µ−1(x) ∈ C0(Ω)3×3 and satisﬁes the condition (1.2), then the
following inequality holds

(3.57)

||E||W 1,p(Ω) ≤ C||E||L2(Ω),

p ≥ 2,

REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS WITH LOW REGULARITY COEFFICIENTS

22

where the constant C does not depend on the solutions E; and ﬁnally if
µ−1(x) ∈ Cβ(Ω)3×3, then there exists α ∈ (0, 1) such that

(3.58)

||E||C1,α(Ω) ≤ C||E||L2(Ω).

Using all the results obtained before, we can address the following esti-

mate to both E and H.

Proposition 20 (Regularity for (E, H)–Homogeneous). Let µ(x), ε(x) ∈
W 1,3+δ, where δ > 0. Let ε(x) and µ(x) satisfy (1.2). Then there exists
α ∈ (0, 1) such that E and H satisfy

(3.59)

||E||C1,α(Ω) + ||H||C1,α(Ω) ≤ C(||E||L2(Ω) + ||H||L2(Ω)).

Proof of Proposition 19. The only diﬀerence in this case is the property of
the terms on the boundary ∂Ω, since E and H satisfy the diﬀerent boundary
conditions. Let us multiply both sides of the equation (3.55) by E, and
integrate it by parts, we get that

ZΩ

µ−1(x)(∇ ∧ E) · (∇ ∧ E)dx +Z∂Ω

(µ−1∇ ∧ E) · (E ∧ ν)dσ = k2ZΩ

Notice that E ∧ ν = 0 on ∂Ω, and so

|E|2dx.

ZΩ

|∇ ∧ E|2dx ≤ CZΩ

|E|2dx.

Based on the estimate of ∇ ∧ E, we can show the interior estimate of |∇E|
exactly as done in the Step 3 of the proof of Proposition 10, where we only
need to exchange the role of ε and µ.

Now we are going to derive the boundary estimates. Let x0 ∈ ∂Ω and
Br be the ball with the center x0 and radius r. Let η be a smooth positive
cut-oﬀ function such that η ≡ 1 in Br and η = 0 on ∂BR.Then multiply η2E
on the both sides of the equation (3.55), after an integration by part,

ZΩ

µ−1(x)(∇∧E)·(∇∧(η2E))dx+Z∂Ω

(µ−1∇∧E)·(η2E∧ν)dσ = k2ZΩ

Notice that η2E ∧ ν = 0 on ∂Ω, so by the employing the H¨older inequality,
it is easy to have that

|ηE|2dx.

(3.60)

ZBr∩Ω

|∇ ∧ E|2dx ≤ C(R)ZBR∩Ω

|E|2dx,

where the constant C(R) depends on R but does not depend on the solutions
E and H.

Next, from the equation ∇ ∧ H + i ωε0ε(x) E = 0, we have that

div(εE) = 0,

with boundary condition E ∧ ν = 0. As the argument in Step 2 of the proof
of Proposition 12, we introduce the transformation of coordinates such that
ν = e3 in the new coordinates (y1, y2, y3), and ˜E satisﬁes that div(˜ε ˜E) = 0,
with boundary conditions ˜E ∧ e3 = 0 on the boundary y3 = 0 in BR(x0).
The boundary condition is actually that

˜E1 = ˜E2 = 0.

REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS WITH LOW REGULARITY COEFFICIENTS

23

We ﬁrst work on the estimates of ˜E1 and ˜E2. Without loss of generality, we
are going to estimate ˜E1. By the equation,

0 = ∂y1(div(˜ε ˜E)) = div(∂y1(˜ε) ˜E + ˜ε∂y1( ˜E))

Note that

∂y1

˜E2 = ∂y2

˜E3 = ∂y3
Let the vector b, which is linear functions of ∇ ∧ ˜E, be

˜E1 + (∇ ∧ ˜E)3,

and

∂y1

˜E1 − (∇ ∧ ˜E)2.

b := (0, (∇ ∧ ˜E)3, −(∇ ∧ ˜E)2)T ,

then ˜E1 satisﬁes the following elliptic equation of second order,

div(˜ε∇ ˜E1) = −div(∂y1(˜ε) ˜E + ˜εb),

with the boundary condition ˜E1 = 0 on ∂Ω.

Multiply η2 ˜E1 on the both sides of the equation, and integrate by part in
BR(y0), where y0 is the corresponding point of x0 in the new coordinates,
then

and

∂y2

˜E3 = ∂y3

which we obtained before. After the change of the coordinates back, we have

ZBr∩Ω

|∇E|2dx ≤ C(R)ZBR∩Ω

|E|2dx.

Again by the standard ﬁnite covering technique, we complete the proof of
the estimate (3.56).

Similarly, for the remaining two estimates, the interior estimates of E and
the boundary estimate of ∇ ∧ E can be achieved by exchanging the role of
ε and µ. The estimate of divE near the boundary ∂Ω can be deduced by
using the relation div(εE) = 0 carefully as done in the proof of the estimate
(3.56), then all the three estimates yield the remaining two estimates of E
in the proposition.
(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 20. By the embedding theorem, µ(x) ∈ Cβ(Ω) and
ε(x) ∈ Cβ(Ω). Then the theorem follows from Proposition 13 and Proposi-
tion 20.
(cid:3)

4. Appendix

In the appendix, we will introduce several important functional spaces
and properties which are used in this paper. Because most of them are
well-known, we only list the lemmas and omit the proof for the shortness.

Deﬁnition 21 (Morrey Space). We denote by Lp,ν(Ω) the Morrey spaces,
and for 1 ≤ p < ∞ and ν ∈ (0, n + p), its norm is deﬁned as

||u||Lp,ν (Ω) = {

sup

x∈Ω,0<r<d

r−νZΩ(x,r)

|u(z)|pdz}

1
p

where Ω(x, r) = Ω ∩ B(x, r), B(x; r) is a ball of which centre is x ∈ Ω. We
call u(x) ∈ Lp,ν(Ω) if ||u||Lp,ν (Ω) < ∞.

REGULARITY OF SOLUTIONS WITH LOW REGULARITY COEFFICIENTS

25

Deﬁnition 22 (Campanato space). We denote by Lp,ν(Ω) the Campanato
spaces, and for the same p, ν used in the deﬁnition 21, the norm of the
Campanato spaces is given as

||u||Lp,ν (Ω) = ||u||Lp,ν (Ω) + {

sup

x∈Ω,0<r<d

r−νZΩ(x,r)

|u(z)|pdz}

1
p

where ¯ux,r = 1

|Ω(x,r)|RΩ(x,r) u(z)dz.

The Morrey space and Campanoto space have the following two well-

known and important properties.
Lemma 23. Lp,ν(Ω) ∼= C0,δ, where δ = ν−n
Lemma 24. Lp,n(Ω) ∼= L∞.
Lemma 25. Lp,ν(Ω) ∼= Lp,ν, for 0 ≤ ν < n.
Deﬁnition 26 (BMO space). We denote by BMO(Ω) the bounded mean
oscillation function space, and its norm is deﬁned as

p and n < ν < n + p.

||u||BMO(Ω) = ||u||L1(Ω) + sup
Q⊂Ω

1

|Q|ZQ

|u − ¯uQ|dx

where Q is a hypercube in Ω and |Q| denotes its volume. We call u ∈
BMO(Ω) if ||u||BMO(Ω) < ∞.
Lemma 27. For any open bounded domain Ω, we have that ||u||BMO(Ω) ≤
||u||L2,n(Ω).

By employing the BMO space, we have the following interpolation theo-

rem.

Lemma 28 (Stampacchia interpolation theorem). Let 1 < q < +∞, and T
be a linear operator. If

||T u||Lq(Ω) ≤C1||u||Lq(Ω),
||T u||BMO(Ω) ≤C2||u||L∞(Ω),

∀u ∈ Lq(Ω),
∀u ∈ L∞(Ω).

Then for p ∈ [q, +∞), ||T u||Lp(Ω) ≤ C||u||Lp(Ω).

The ﬁnal one is the Helmholtz decomposition in the vector analysis.

Lemma 29 (Helmholtz decomposition). Suppose Ω is a bounded, simply-
connected, Lipschitz domain. Every square-integrable vector ﬁeld u ∈ (L2(Ω))3
has an orthogonal decomposition:

where ϕ ∈ H1(Ω) is a scalar function, and A ∈ H1(curl, Ω).

u = ∇ϕ + ∇ ∧ A,
