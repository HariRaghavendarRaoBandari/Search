ABSTRACT

We report the discovery of 15 quasars and bright galaxies at 5.7 < z < 6.9. This is the initial
result from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) project, which
exploits the exquisite multi-band imaging data produced by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC)
Strategic Program survey. The candidate selection is performed by combining several photometric
approaches including a Bayesian probabilistic algorithm to reject stars and dwarfs. The spectroscopic
identiﬁcation was carried out with the Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Subaru Telescope for the
ﬁrst 80 deg2 of the survey footprint. The success rate of our photometric selection is quite high,
approaching 100 % at the brighter magnitudes (zAB < 23.5 mag). Our selection also recovered all the
known high-z quasars on the HSC images. Among the 15 discovered objects, six are likely quasars,
while the other six with interstellar absorption lines and in some cases narrow emission lines are likely
bright Lyman-break galaxies. The remaining three objects have weak continua and very strong and
narrow Ly α lines, which may be excited by ultraviolet light from both young stars and quasars.
These results indicate that we are starting to see the steep rise of the luminosity function of z ≥ 6
galaxies, compared to that of quasars, at magnitudes fainter than M1450 ∼ −22 mag or zAB ∼ 24
mag. Follow-up studies of the discovered objects as well as further survey observations are ongoing.

1. INTRODUCTION

The era from the birth of the ﬁrst stars to cos-
mic reionization is one of the key subjects in astron-
omy and astrophysics today. While the formation of
the ﬁrst stars is still largely unexplored observationally,
the epoch of reionization is being explored with sev-
eral diﬀerent approaches. The latest measurements of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by the Planck
space mission suggest a reionization optical depth of
τ = 0.066 ± 0.016. When interpreted as a sharp tran-
sition from a neutral to ionized intergalactic medium
(IGM), this corresponds to a reionization redshift of
z = 8.8+1.7
−1.4 (Planck Collaboration 2015). This value
is marginally consistent with the rapid decline of the

H I neutral fraction from z ∼ 8 to z ∼ 6,
inferred
from the evolving Ly α luminosity function of galax-
ies (e.g., Ouchi et al. 2008, 2010; Konno et al. 2014;
Bouwens et al. 2015; Choudhury et al. 2015). At z ∼ 6,
the Universe is in the ﬁnal phase of reionization, as in-
dicated by the small H I optical depth of the IGM esti-
mated from the Gunn & Peterson (1965, GP hereafter)
troughs of luminous high-z quasars (Fan et al. 2006a).

Active galactic nuclei

The main source of the ultraviolet (UV) photons that
caused the reionization of the Universe is still under
debate.
It has been argued that star-forming galaxies
observed in deep surveys are not able to produce suf-
ﬁcient number of photons to sustain reionization (e.g.,
Robertson et al. 2010, 2013), while the revised Planck
results may alleviate this problem (Robertson et al.
2015).
(AGNs) have been
studied as a possible additional source of
ionizing
photons (e.g., Lehnert & Bremer 2003; Fontanot et al.
2012; Grissom et al.
2015;
Madau & Haardt 2015), but the results are still contro-
versial, largely due to the lack of knowledge about the
numbers of faint AGNs residing in the reionization era.
High-z quasars are a key population to understand
the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) as well. If the assembly of a SMBH is predomi-
nantly via gas accretion onto a seed black hole with mass
MBH,0, then the time needed to grow to the mass MBH
is

2014; Giallongo et al.

Edd ln(cid:18) MBH
MBH,0(cid:19)

t = tEdd(cid:18) ǫ
1 − ǫ(cid:19)λ−1
= 0.043 ln(cid:18) MBH

MBH,0(cid:19) Gyr,

where tEdd = 0.44µ−1
e Gyr is the Eddington timescale, µe
is the mean molecular weight per electron, ǫ is the radia-
tive eﬃciency, and λEdd is the Eddington ratio (Shapiro
2005; Madau et al. 2014); here we assume that λEdd
is constant in time. We adopt µe = 1.15, ǫ = 0.1,
and λEdd = 1.0 to derive the second line of the equa-
tion. For example, a seed with MBH,0 = 100M⊙ will
take 0.7 Gyr to form a quasar with MBH = 109M⊙.
Since this timescale is comparable to the cosmic time
elapsed between z = 20 and z = 6, the SMBH mass
functions at z > 6 convey critical information about
the mass distribution of the seed black holes and the
mode of subsequent growth, including super-Eddington
accretion (Kawaguchi et al. 2004).
Indeed, recent dis-
coveries of the luminous quasars ULAS J1120+0641 with
MBH ∼ 2 × 109M⊙ at z = 7.085 (Mortlock et al. 2011)
and SDSS J0100+2802 with MBH ∼ 1 × 1010M⊙ at
z = 6.30 (Wu et al. 2015) have made a signiﬁcant im-
pact on such models (e.g., Volonteri 2012; Ferrara et al.
2014; Madau et al. 2014).

Furthermore, high-z quasars are a signpost of galaxies
and high density peaks in the dark matter distribution
in the early Universe. The stellar and gaseous properties
in and around the host galaxies can be studied in the
optical/infrared (e.g., Kashikawa et al. 2007; Goto et al.
2009, 2012; Willott et al. 2011) or at sub-mm/radio
wavelengths
(e.g., Maiolino et al. 2005; Wang et al.
2007; Venemans et al. 2012, 2016; Wang et al. 2013;
Willott et al. 2013, 2015), giving a unique probe of galax-

ies in the reionization era. The chemical enrichment,
and thus the preceding star formation history, can be
measured with strong metal emission lines arising from
ionized gas around the quasar nuclei (e.g., Jiang et al.
2007; De Rosa et al. 2011, 2014). On the whole, no or
little chemical evolution of quasars has been observed
from z ∼ 7 to the local Universe. A good example of this
is ULAS J1120+0641, whose emission-line and contin-
uum spectrum is strikingly similar to those of the local
quasars except for the deep GP trough.

In the last two decades, there has been great progress
in the quest for high-z quasars25. The SDSS (York et al.
2000) provided the ﬁrst opportunity to search for high-
z quasars over wide ﬁelds (> 1000 deg2), resulting
in several tens of objects published to date (Fan et al.
2000, 2001a, 2003, 2004, 2006b; Jiang et al. 2008, 2009,
2015).
The Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey
(CFHQS; Willott et al. 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010a,b) ex-
plored fainter magnitudes than the SDSS and found a
few tens of new quasars, including one very faint ob-
ject (CFHQS J0216−0455; zAB = 24.4 mag at z =
6.01) discovered in the Subaru XMM-Newton Deep
Survey (SXDS; Furusawa et al. 2008) area. However,
these optical surveys are not sensitive to redshifts be-
yond z = 6.5, where quasars become almost invisi-
ble at observed wavelengths λobs < 0.9 µm due to
strong IGM absorption. The ﬁrst quasar discovered
at z > 6.5 is ULAS J1120+0641 mentioned above,
which was selected from near-infrared (NIR) data of
the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) In-
frared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS; Lawrence et al. 2007).
With the advent of the Visible and Infrared Survey
Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) Kilo-degree Infrared
Galaxy (VIKING) survey, more z > 6.5 quasars are be-
ing discovered (Venemans et al. 2013, 2015b). New op-
tical wide-ﬁeld surveys such as the Panoramic Survey
Telescope & Rapid Response System 1 (Pan-STARRS1;
Kaiser et al. 2010) 3π survey and the Dark Energy
Survey (Dark Energy Survey Collaboration 2016) are
equipped with a y-band ﬁlter centered at 9500 – 10000
˚A, and are starting to deliver many more quasars at
6 ≤ z ≤ 7 (Ba˜nados et al. 2014; Reed et al. 2015).
In
addition, there are various smaller projects which have
succeeded in identifying high-z quasars (e.g., Goto 2006;
Carnall et al. 2015; Kashikawa et al. 2015; Kim et al.
2015). In total, the above surveys have identiﬁed about
a hundred high-z quasars published to date. Most of
the quasars are located at z < 6.5 and zAB < 22.5 mag,
while the higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes are still
poorly explored. The known bright high-z quasars must
be just the tip of the iceberg predominantly comprised
of faint quasars and AGNs, which may be a signiﬁcant
contributor to reionization, and may represent the more
typical mode of SMBH growth in the early Universe.

This paper describes our ongoing project, SHEL-
LQs (Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity
Quasars), which is the ﬁrst 1,000-deg2 class survey for
high-z quasars with a 8-m class telescope. The project
exploits multi-band photometry data produced by the
Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic

Program (SSP) survey. We present the results of the
initial follow-up spectroscopy of photometric candidates,
performed in the 2015 Fall and 2016 Spring semesters,
which delivered 15 high-z objects including both quasars
and bright galaxies. This paper is organized as follows.
We introduce the Subaru HSC-SSP survey in §2. The
details of the photometric candidate selection are pre-
sented in §3. The spectroscopic follow-up observations
are described in §4. The quasars and galaxies we have
discovered are presented and discussed in §5. The sum-
mary appears in §6. We adopt the cosmological param-
eters H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1, ΩM = 0.3, and ΩΛ =
0.7. All magnitudes in the optical and NIR bands are
presented in the AB system (Oke & Gunn 1983). Mag-
nitudes refer to point spread function (PSF) magnitudes
(see §2) corrected for Galactic extinction (Schlegel et al.
1998) unless otherwise noted.

2. THE SUBARU HSC-SSP SURVEY

The Subaru HSC-SSP survey (Takada et al., in prep.)
is a large collaborative project contributed by researchers
in Japan, Taiwan, and Princeton University. The project
started in early 2014, and will include 300 nights, ending
in 2019. It uses the HSC (Miyazaki et al. 2012, Miyazaki
et al., in prep.), a wide-ﬁeld camera newly installed on
the Subaru 8.2-m telescope on the summit of Maunakea.
HSC is equipped with 116 2K × 4K Hamamatsu fully-
depleted CCDs, of which 104 CCDs are used to obtain
science data. The pixel scale is 0′′.17. The camera has a
nearly circular ﬁeld-of-view of 1◦.5 diameter, which en-
ables it to image 1.77 deg2 of the sky in a single shot.
Five broad-band ﬁlters (g, r, i, z, and y) and several
narrow-band ﬁlters are currently available.

The HSC-SSP survey has three layers with diﬀerent
combinations of area and depth. The Wide layer aims
to observe 1,400 deg2 mostly along the celestial equator
through the ﬁve broad-band ﬁlters. The present paper is
based on this Wide layer data. The total exposure times
range from 10 min in the g, r bands to 20 min in the
i, z, and y bands, divided into individual exposures of
∼3 min each. The target 5σ limiting magnitudes are (g,
r, i, z, y) = (26.5, 26.1, 25.9, 25.1, 24.4) mag measured
in 2′′.0 aperture. The Deep and Ultra-Deep layers ob-
serve 27 and 3.5 deg2, respectively, within and around
popular deep survey ﬁelds. Five broad-band ﬁlters and
four narrow-band ﬁlters are used, aiming to reach the 5σ
limiting depth of r = 27.1 mag (Deep) or r = 27.7 mag
(Ultra-Deep).

The SHELLQs project exploits the exquisite HSC sur-
vey data to search for low-luminosity quasars at high
redshift. Assuming the quasar luminosity function at
z ≥ 6 presented by Willott et al. (2010b), the expected
numbers of newly identiﬁed quasars in the Wide layer
are ∼500 with zAB < 24.5 mag at z ∼ 6 and ∼100 with
yAB < 24.0 mag at z ∼ 7. The former magnitude limit
corresponds to M1450 < −22 mag for a typical quasar
spectral energy distribution (SED), thus allowing us to
explore ∼2 mag lower luminosity than any previous wide-
ﬁeld survey at z ∼ 6 (e.g., Jiang et al. 2009). Our ﬁlter
set is sensitive to quasars with redshifts up to z ∼ 7.4,
i.e., beyond the current quasar redshift record. However,
the detection capability sharply drops at z > 7 where
the GP trough comes into the y band, hence the survey
is limited to intrinsically very luminous objects at those

redshift. The deep optical data produced by the HSC
survey will also provide opportunities to explore even
higher redshifts when combined with wide and deep NIR
surveys.

This paper describes the results from the early HSC
survey data taken before 2015 August. It covers roughly
80 deg2 in the ﬁve broad bands in the Wide layer, with
the median seeing of 0′′.6 – 0′′.8. Data reduction was
performed with the dedicated pipeline hscPipe (version
3.8.5; Bosch et al., in prep.) derived from the Large Syn-
optic Survey Telescope software pipeline26 (Juri´c et al.
2015), for all the standard procedures including bias sub-
traction, ﬂat ﬁelding with dome ﬂats, stacking, astromet-
ric and photometric calibrations, as well as source detec-
tion and measurements. The astrometric and photomet-
ric calibrations are tied to the Pan-STARRS1 system27
(Schlaﬂy et al. 2012; Tonry et al. 2012; Magnier et al.
2013). We utilize forced photometry, which allows for
ﬂux measurements in all the ﬁve bands with a consis-
tent aperture deﬁned in a reference band. The refer-
ence band is i by default and is switched to z (y) for
extremely red sources with no detection in the i (z) and
bluer bands. We use the PSF magnitude (mPSF, or sim-
ply m) and the cModel magnitude (mcModel), which are
measured by ﬁtting the PSF models and two-component,
PFS-convolved galaxy models to the source proﬁle, re-
spectively (Abazajian et al. 2004). We measure ﬂuxes
and colors of sources with mPSF, while the source ex-
tendedness is evaluated with mPSF − mcModel.

We performed a rough assessment of the completeness
limits achieved in the early Wide survey as follows. In
each subregion of the sky with approximate size of 12′×
12′, we select all the sources whose processing ﬂags indi-
cate clean photometry, and measure the number counts
N (m).
It typically follows a straight line in the m -

ﬁne the 50 % completeness magnitude at the point where

log(cid:2)N (m)(cid:3) plane at bright magnitudes, then peaks at
m = mpeak. We ﬁt a straight line eN (m) to the m -
log(cid:2)N (m)(cid:3) relation at mpeak−5 < m < mpeak−1 and de-
N (m) falls to one-half of eN (m). The resultant complete-

ness magnitudes averaged over all the ﬁelds are (26.5,
26.3, 26.4, 25.5, 24.7) mag in the (g, r, i, z, y) band,
respectively, with a typical ﬁeld-to-ﬁeld variation of 0.3
mag. The spatial pattern of the above estimates agrees
with that of the seeing, in such a way that poor seeing is

accompanied by worse-than-average depth. These com-
pleteness magnitudes are roughly 0.3 mag fainter than
the target limiting magnitudes of the survey mentioned
above, which is at least partly because of the diﬀerences
in the adopted magnitudes (PSF magnitudes or 2′′.0-
aperture magnitudes) and in the deﬁnitions of the depths
(50-% completeness or 5σ detection).

Our project beneﬁts from archival NIR data from
UKIDSS and VIKING. The UKIDSS is a multi-tiered
imaging survey using WFCAM, a wide ﬁeld camera
mounted on the UKIRT 3.8-m telescope (Lawrence et al.
2007). The widest Large Area Survey covers most of the
HSC survey footprint, with the target 5σ limiting mag-
nitudes of (Y , J, H, K) = (20.9, 20.4, 20.0, 20.1) mag
measured in 2′′.0 aperture. The VIKING is one of the
public surveys of the European Southern Observatory
with the VISTA 4.1-m telescope. This project aims to
observe 1,500 deg2 of the sky, with the target 5σ limiting
magnitudes of (Z, Y , J, H, K) = (23.1, 22.3, 22.1, 21.5,
21.2) mag measured in 2′′.0 aperture. Roughly half of the
HSC survey footprint will be covered by the VIKING at
its completion.

3. PHOTOMETRIC CANDIDATE SELECTION

High-z quasars are characterized by extremely red op-
tical colors caused by strong IGM absorption bluewards
of Ly α. This is demonstrated in Figure 1, which presents
i − z and z − y colors of model quasars and other popula-
tions in the HSC passband system. There are two major
sources of astrophysical contamination to the photomet-
ric selection of quasars. One is Galactic brown dwarfs,
which have been the most serious contaminants in past
surveys because of their very red colors and point-like
appearance. The other is faint Lyman break galaxies
(LBGs) at z ≥ 6, which are also aﬀected by IGM ab-
sorption. We expect that the excellent image quality
of the HSC will help distinguish quasars and galaxies
morphologically, but this remains to be conﬁrmed. Fig-
ure 2 displays the luminosity functions of high-z quasars
(Willott et al. 2010b) and LBGs (Bouwens et al. 2006,
2011). Although they are still poorly constrained at
M1450 > −24 mag for quasars and at M1350 < −22 for
LBGs, it is likely that the two functions intersect at ap-
parent magnitude of ∼ 24 mag, with LBGs outnumber-
ing quasars at fainter magnitudes. This is why previous
surveys at brighter magnitudes did not suﬀer from se-
vere LBG contamination. Note also that the usual as-
sumption that high-z quasars are point sources may not
be valid for low-luminosity populations due to the host
galaxy contribution.

There are several methods to extract quasar candidates
from multi-band imaging data. Our Main sample of can-
didates is selected based on a Bayesian probabilistic ap-
proach, as detailed in §3.1.
It computes the posterior
probability for each source being a high-z quasar rather
than a red star or dwarf, based on photometry in all
the available bands as well as SED and surface density
models of the populations under consideration. We use
photometry in the HSC optical bands plus the NIR bands
(Y , J, H, K) where available from UKIDSS or VIKING.
In addition, we construct an Auxiliary sample of candi-
dates with two approaches, namely, classical SED ﬁtting
and simple color cuts, as described in §3.2. These ad-
ditional selections allow us to evaluate possible bias and

incompleteness inherent to the Bayesian approach and
thus complement the Main sample. We describe the en-
tire ﬂow of the candidate selection from the HSC-SSP
database to the ﬁnal spectroscopic targets in §3.3. Our
selection procedure has eﬃciently removed contaminants,
recovered all the known quasars imaged by the HSC so
far (§3.4), and discovered a number of new objects as
described in the following sections.

3.1. Main sample

The Main sample of quasar candidates is selected with
a Bayesian probabilistic algorithm, developed following
Mortlock et al. (2012). Here we assume that galaxies and
relatively blue stars with O to early-M spectral types
have been removed in advance with color and extend-
edness cuts (see §3.3), and we therefore do not model a
population of LBGs. For a detected source with the ob-
served quantities ~d, the Bayesian probability P B
Q of being
a quasar is given by:

Q ( ~d) =
P B

WQ( ~d)

WQ( ~d) + WD( ~d)

and

WQ/D( ~d) = Z S(~p) P r(det|~p) P r( ~d|~p) d~p

(1)

(2)

where the subscripts Q and D denote a quasar and a
brown dwarf, respectively. The vector ~d represents the
magnitudes in all the available bands in the present
case, while ~p represents the intrinsic source properties,
i.e., luminosity and redshift for a quasar and luminos-
ity and spectral type for a brown dwarf. The functions
S(~p), P r(det|~p), and P r( ~d|~p) represent the surface num-
ber density, the probability that the source is detected
(“det”), and the probability that the source has the ob-
served quantities ~d, respectively, each as a function of
~p.

We compute S(~p) with the quasar luminosity function
of Willott et al. (2010b) and the Galactic brown dwarf
model of Caballero et al. (2008). The latter model takes
into account the spatial density distributions and lumi-
nosites of late-M, L, and T dwarfs and allows one to
compute number counts for each spectral type at a given
Galactic coordinate. Since the HSC-SSP survey depth
has not been fully analyzed yet (§2), we arbitrarily set
P r(det|~p) = 1 for zAB < 26.0 or yAB < 25.0 mag and 0
otherwise. The SED models required for P r( ~d|~p) are cre-
ated as follows. The quasar model spectrum at z = 0 is
ﬁrst created by stacking the SDSS spectra of 340 bright
quasars at z ≃ 3, where the quasar selection is fairly
complete (Richards et al. 2002; Willott et al. 2005), af-
ter correcting for the foreground IGM absorption. The
IGM H I opacity data are taken from Songaila (2004).
This spectrum is then placed at various redshifts with
the appropriate IGM absorption taken into account, and
convolved with the ﬁlter transmission functions to com-
pute colors. Since the model spectra redshifted to z > 6
do not extend beyond the J band, we take the J − H and
H − K colors from Hewett et al. (2006). The dwarf col-
ors are computed with a set of observed spectra compiled

(crosses and diamonds). The SED models for quasars and brown dwarfs are described in §3.1. The galaxy colors are calculated with the
spectral templates taken from Gonz´alez et al. (2012), while the colors of O – M stars are computed with the Pickles (1998) library. The
dots along the blue and green lines represent redshifts in steps of 0.1, with z = 6.0 and 6.5 marked by the large open circles. The hatched
area in lower left indicates the color space excluded from the HSC-SSP database query in the ﬁrst step of our quasar selection (§3.3). As a
demonstration, the grey scale represents the Bayesian quasar probabilities P B
Q (Equations 1 and 2; the color bar is found at the top) over
this plane, assuming zAB = 24.0 mag and the 5σ limiting magnitudes of (iAB, zAB, yAB) = (26.5, 25.5, 25.0) mag. Galaxy models are not
included in the Bayesian algorithm at present.

in the SpeX prism library28 and in the CGS4 library29.
Because of the discrete sampling of the brown-dwarf tem-
plates grouped into individual spectral types, the integra-
tion in Equation 2 is treated as a summation for spectral
types. Finally, the ﬂux errors are taken from the outputs
of the HSC image processing pipeline, and are assumed
to follow a Gaussian probability density distribution in
the ﬂux unit.

inating contaminants, it may be subject to unknown bias

or incompleteness because of its dependence on empiri-
cal SED and surface density models. In order to mon-
itor these eﬀects and complement the Main sample, we
create an Auxiliary sample of candidates with two inde-
pendent methods, i.e., classical SED ﬁtting and simple
color cuts. As in the Main selection, galaxies and rela-
tively blue stars are assumed to be removed before the
following selections are performed.

The SED ﬁtting algorithm ﬁts a wide variety of spec-
tral models to the observed ﬂuxes in all the available
HSC, UKIDSS, and VIKING bands. Each quasar model
is a combination of power-law continuum and emis-
sion lines with a Gaussian proﬁle, assuming various
values of power-law slope, line strength, and dust ex-
tinction, drawn from the statistics measured at z > 3
(Fan et al. 2001b; Diamond-Stanic et al. 2009). We use
the dust extinction law for the Small Magellanic Cloud
(Prevot et al. 1984). The models of stars and brown

the dashed lines, LBGs likely outnumber quasars at apparent magnitudes fainter than ∼24 mag.

dwarfs are taken from the Kurucz (1993) and Allard
(2012) libraries assuming solar metallicity. The ﬁtting
is performed with the standard χ2 minimization method
using the photometric errors from the pipeline, and as-
signs a quasar probability P S
Q to each candidate, with
no Bayesian prior (i.e., no weighting by the S(~p) from
Equation 2).

We also consider the following simple color cuts for the

candidate selection:

(iPSF − zPSF > 2.0 and zPSF − yPSF < 0.5)
or
(zPSF − yPSF > 2.0).

The above criteria are based on the quasar locus on the
i − z versus z − y diagram shown in Figure 1. Each can-
didate is assigned P C
Q = 1 if it satisﬁes the color criteria
and 0 otherwise. The magnitude limits are described in
the next section.

3.3. Selection ﬂow

The present work is based on the HSC-SSP Wide-layer
data included in the S15A internal data release, which
happened in 2015 September. Forced photometry (see
§2) on the stacked images is used. We ﬁrst query the
HSC-SSP database for non-blended30 sources meeting
the following criteria:

(zAB < 24.5 and σz < 0.155 and iAB − zAB > 1.5

and zAB − zcModel,AB < 0.3) (3)

or

(yAB < 24.0 and σy < 0.155 and zAB − yAB > 0.8

and yAB − ycModel,AB < 0.3) (4)

and without any critical quality ﬂags assigned.31
Throughout this paper iAB, zAB, and yAB refer to PFS

30 In particular, we query sources that are isolated or deblended
from parent blended sources, and we reject those parents. This
corresponds to deblend.nchild = 0 in the database language.

31

Speciﬁcally, we require that the source is (i) not close
to an edge of the processed image frame (flags.pixel.edge =

magnitudes. The ﬁrst two lines of conditions select i-
band dropouts at z ∼ 6, while the latter two select z-
band dropouts at z ∼ 7. The color cuts are used to
exclude relatively blue stars with O to early-M spectral
types (see Figure 1), while the diﬀerence between the
PSF and cModel magnitudes is used to exclude extended
sources. After the database query, we further remove
low-z interlopers with more than 3σ detection in the g
or r band.

The above initial candidates are matched to the
UKIDSS and VIKING catalogs within 1′′.0 in the over-
lapping survey area, and then processed through the
Bayesian selection algorithm. Those with signiﬁcant
quasar probability, P B
Q > 0.1, are added to the Main
sample of candidates. Those with lower P B
Q are further
checked with the SED-ﬁtting algorithm and the simple
color-cut criteria described in §3.2, and added to the
Auxiliary sample if P S
Q = 1. We calcu-
lated P S
Q for the objects in the Main sample as
well and found that they always meet the Auxiliary se-
lection criteria, i.e., the Main sample is a subsample of
the Auxiliary sample.

Q > 0.1 or P C

Q and P C

Because we are looking for rare faint objects detected
in only one or two bands, we are sensitive to false dropout
sources of both astrophysical and non-astrophysical ori-
gins, as described below. However, we can take advan-
tage of the fact that in the HSC-SSP Wide survey, each
patch of the sky is visited and imaged several times with
diﬀerent dithering positions. Glitches in the data may
become apparent upon comparing the individual per-
visit exposures. For every candidate, we retrieve and per-
form photometry on all the per-visit images with Source
Extractor, version 2.8.6 (Bertin & Arnouts 1996), in the
double-image mode, with the stacked image as the detec-
tion reference. If any of the per-visit photometric mea-
surements deviate by more than three times the measure-

False), (ii) not in a bad CCD region (i.e., bad pixels or vi-
gnetted area; flags.bad.center = False), (iii) not saturated
(flags.pixel.saturated.center = False), and (iv) not aﬀected
by cosmic rays (flags.pixel.cr.center = False), in the i, z, and
y bands.

1. We found that all of them successfully pass our selec-
tion criteria and end up in the Main sample, as marked
by the dark blue cells in Figure 3. The Bayesian quasar
probability is P B
Q = 1.000 in all cases. The ﬁgure implies
that the success rate of our quasar selection is quite high
at the brightest magnitudes; for example, three of the
four candidates at z < 22.5 mag are indeed previously-
discovered high-z quasars. The ﬁve known quasars in-
clude CFHQS J0216−0455 with z = 24.22 mag, which,
as we discussed in §1, is the faintest high-z quasar ever
discovered.

Thus our candidate selection works quite eﬃciently at
the brighter magnitudes. We now start to explore the
remainder of the sample with new spectroscopic obser-
vations, as described in the next section.

4. SPECTROSCOPY

We carried out spectroscopic follow-up observations of
the quasar candidates in the 2015 Fall and 2016 Spring
semesters. One of the candidates was observed with
the Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-
Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS; Cepa et al.
2000) mounted on the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC)
in 2015 September, which led to the ﬁrst discovery of a
high-z quasar from our project. We also observed 19 can-
didates with the Faint Object Camera and Spectrograph
(FOCAS; Kashikawa et al. 2002) mounted on Subaru in
2015 November and December, and identiﬁed 14 more
quasars and galaxies. We further obtained additional ex-
posures for a few of the above objects in 2016 February.
The journal of these discovery observations is presented
in Table 2. The details of the observations are described
in the following sections.

4.1. GTC/OSIRIS

GTC is a 10.4-m telescope located at the Observato-
rio del Roque de los Muchachos in La Palma, Spain.
Our program (GTC19-15B; Iwasawa et al.) was awarded
14.4 hours in the 2015B semester. We used OSIRIS with
the R2500I grism and 1′′.0-wide longslit, which provides
spectral coverage from λobs = 0.74 to 1.0 µm with a res-
olution R ∼ 1500. The observations were carried out in
queue mode on dark nights with excellent weather con-
ditions and the seeing 0′′.7 – 1′′.0.

The data were reduced using the Image Reduction and
Analysis Facility (IRAF32). Bias correction, ﬂat ﬁelding
with dome ﬂats, sky subtraction, and 1d extraction were
performed in the standard way. The wavelength was cal-
ibrated with reference to the arc lamp spectra. The ﬂux
calibration was tied to the white dwarf standard stars
Ross 640 and G191-B2B observed on the same nights.
We corrected for the slit loss by scaling the spectra to
match the HSC z-band magnitudes.

One of the Main candidates was observed in this GTC
run and identiﬁed to be a quasar at z = 6.10. Its spec-
trum is presented in §5.
In addition, we observed ﬁve
candidates selected from the older (S14B) version of the
HSC-SSP data release. These ﬁve objects are no longer
quasar candidates with the revised photometry in our

32 IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Ob-
servatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for
Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement
with the National Science Foundation.

Fig. 3.— Magnitude histogram of the 38 Main candidates. The
ﬁve dark blue cells represent high-z quasars known prior to our
survey. The remaining cells are color-coded according to the results
of our follow-up spectroscopy (see §4) as follows. Light blue: high-
z quasars, green: high-z galaxies, red: brown dwarf, dark grey:
moving object or transient event, light grey: ambiguous nature
due to the low spectral S/N, white: awaiting spectroscopy. The
two cells in lower right represent z-band dropouts. The success
rate of our photometric quasar selection is quite high, approaching
100 % at the brighter magnitudes (zAB < 23.5 mag). Most of the
contaminants at fainter magnitudes are high-z galaxies.

ment error from the stacked photometry, the candidate
is eliminated. This procedure is performed in the band
in which the source photometry has the highest signal-
to-noise (S/N) ratio (typically the z band for i dropouts
and the y band for z dropouts). We also reject candi-
dates with too compact, diﬀuse, or elliptical proﬁles to
be celestial point sources with the Source Extractor mea-
surements on the stacked images. The eliminated sources
are mostly cosmic rays, moving or transient sources, and
image artifacts. Finally we inspect images of all the re-
maining candidates by eye, and reject additional prob-
lematic objects.

In the present survey area covering 80 deg2, we had
roughly 50,000 red point sources meeting the database
query conditions (Equations 3 and 4) and undetected in
the g and r bands. Although ∼35,000 candidates further
passed the Bayesian selection (P B
Q > 0.1), the vast major-
ity (> 99.5 %) of them were eliminated by checking per-
visit photometry and source morphology as above. After
the ﬁnal visual inspection, only 38 sources are found in
the Main sample. On the other hand, we are still in the
process of optimizing the Auxiliary selection so that a
reasonable number of candidates are extracted. The re-
maining part of this paper focuses on the Main sample,
for which the follow-up spectroscopy has been partially
carried out (§4).

3.4. Recovery of known quasars

Figure 3 presents the Main sample selected above as
the magnitude histogram. We found 36 i-band dropouts
as z ∼ 6 quasar candidates, and two z-band dropouts
as z ∼ 7 quasar candidates. The magnitudes of the for-
mer objects range from zAB = 21.8 mag to the limiting
magnitude of our selection, zAB = 24.5 mag, while the
latter objects are fairly bright in the y band, 21.7 and
22.6 mag.

There are ﬁve high-z quasars identiﬁed prior to our sur-
vey in the present area. They are summarized in Table

the current Main sample.
Indeed, their OSIRIS spec-
tra show relatively smooth red continua characteristic of
brown dwarfs, which are also consistent with the latest
HSC magnitudes. The detailed analysis of these objects
is still underway and will be reported in a future paper.

4.2. Subaru/FOCAS

Our program was awarded four nights in the S15B
semester (S15B-070; Matsuoka et al.) and ﬁve nights in
the S16A semester (S16A-076; Matsuoka et al.) with the
Subaru 8.2-m telescope. We used FOCAS in the multi-
object spectrograph mode with the VPH900 grism and
SO58 order-sorting ﬁlter. The widths of the slitlets were
set to 1′′.0. This conﬁguration provides spectral coverage
from λobs = 0.75 to 1.05 µm with a resolution R ∼ 1200.
The observations were carried out in grey nights in 2015
November, December, and 2016 February. A few of these

nights were occasionally aﬀected by cirrus and poor see-
ing (1′′.0 ∼ 2′′.0), while the weather was fairly good with
seeing 0′′.6 – 0′′.8 in the rest of the observations.

The data were reduced with IRAF using the dedicated
FOCASRED package. Bias correction, ﬂat ﬁelding with
dome ﬂats, sky subtraction, and 1d extraction were per-
formed in the standard way. The wavelength was cali-
brated with reference to the sky emission lines. The ﬂux
calibration was tied to the white dwarf standard star
Feige 110 observed on the same nights as the targets.
We corrected for the slit loss by scaling the spectra to
match the HSC magnitudes in the z band for the i-band
dropouts and y band for the one z-band dropout we ob-
served.

We observed 19 targets from the Main sample, includ-
ing the quasar identiﬁed with GTC/OSIRIS, and iden-
tiﬁed 14 new high-z quasars and galaxies as well as a
brown dwarf. Their ﬁnal spectra are presented in §5.
One of the z-band dropout targets was not found at the
HSC position at the time of the spectroscopy, so is most
likely a moving object or a transient event caught by the
HSC y-band observations. All the y-band exposures of
this object were taken in a single day, and our inspection
of per-visit images did not detect signiﬁcant day-scale
motion or ﬂux variation. The spectral S/N of the re-
maining two targets is too low to judge their nature at
this moment.

5. DISCOVERY OF HIGH-Z QUASARS AND GALAXIES

Figure 4 displays the spectra of the identiﬁed quasars
and possible quasars, while Figure 5 displays those of the
non-quasars, i.e., galaxies and a brown dwarf. Their pho-
tometric and spectroscopic properties are summarized in
Table 3. We ﬁrst present short notes on the individual
quasars in §5.1 and then on the contaminating objects
in §5.2. Discussion and future prospects are described in
§5.3.

5.1. Notes on individual quasars

5.1.1. HSC J1205−0000

This object is a z-band dropout source with the HSC
photometry. While the deep IGM absorption trough at
λobs < 9350 ˚A suggests the redshift of this source is z &
6.7, the interpretation of the redder part of the spectrum
is diﬃcult with the present S/N. If we assume that the
strongest peak at λobs = 9550 ˚A is the Ly α line, then the
redshift is z = 6.85. In this case, the residual ﬂux around
9400 ˚A would imply that there is an ionized bubble at
z ∼ 6.7 within the IGM, which might be caused by the
quasar itself (e.g., Carilli et al. 2010) or a diﬀerent source
in front of the quasar. Alternatively, the Ly α line may
be at a shorter wavelength and signiﬁcantly aﬀected by

object name and the estimated redshift are indicated at the top left corner of each panel. The blue dotted lines mark the expected positions
of the Ly α and N V λ1240 emission lines. The spectra were smoothed using inverse-variance weighted means in 3 – 7 pixel (depending on
the S/N) boxes, for display purpose. The bottom panel displays a sky spectrum.

a broad absorption line (BAL) system of N V λ1240. If
the 9550 ˚A peak is assumed to be the N V line, then
the estimated redshift is z = 6.70 and Ly α is at 9365 ˚A
where no or little ﬂux is observed.

5.1.2. HSC J2236+0032

The IGM absorption trough at λobs < 9000 ˚A indicates
that the redshift of this source is z & 6.4. The redder
part of the spectrum is relatively blue and indicates this
object is a quasar with no Ly α emission line. The ab-
sence of Ly α may be due to the intrinsic nature of this
quasar or by the damping wing of severe IGM absorp-
tion. If we assume the Ly α wavelength of λobs = 9000
˚A, then the estimated redshift is z = 6.4. In this case, the
spectral position of the strong BAL observed at around
9200 ˚A corresponds to N V λ1240. Indeed, quasars with
weak or no Ly α emission have been reported in the liter-
ature (e.g., Fan et al. 1999; Diamond-Stanic et al. 2009;
Shemmer et al. 2010).

5.1.3. HSC J0859+0022

This is an unambiguous quasar with strong and broad
emission lines at λobs = 8990 and 9170 ˚A, which are Ly α
and N V λ1240 at z = 6.39. The continuum is very weak
even at the wavelengths unaﬀected by IGM absorption
(i.e., redwards of the Ly α line), which may suggest the
presence of signiﬁcant dust extinction around the quasar
nucleus or in the host galaxy.

5.1.4. HSC J1152+0055

The spectrum is typical of a high-z quasar. The red-
shift measured with the Ly α line is z = 6.37, but is
quite uncertain, given the asymmetry in the line due to
the onset of the Ly α forest.

5.1.5. HSC J2232+0012

The spectrum is reminiscent of those of Ly α emit-
ters found in deep galaxy surveys (e.g., Ono et al. 2012).
The Ly α redshift is z = 6.18. The luminosity, rest-
frame equivalent width, and full width at half max-
imum (FWHM; after correcting for the instrumental
broadening) of the line are L(Lyα) ∼ 1043.9 erg s−1,
W0(Lyα) ∼ 80 ˚A, and vFWHM(Lyα) ∼ 540 km s−1, re-
spectively. The high L (Lyα) may imply the presence
of AGN contribution, as a recent study of a large sam-
ple of Lyman α emitters at z = 2.2 (Konno et al. 2016)
suggests that the bright emitters with L(Lyα) > 1043.4
erg s−1 are almost always contributed by AGNs, based
on their X-ray, UV, or radio properties. The measured L
(Lyα) and vFWHM(Lyα) are similar to those of the high-z
galaxy “CR7” which is suggested to contain Population-
III-like stars (Sobral et al. 2015, based on the very strong
nebular lines including He II λ1640), while W0(Lyα) is
less than half that of CR7. The AGN contribution in this
object may also be supported by the possible broad-line
component seen at the redwards of Ly α, as well as the
relatively large vFWHM(Lyα) (see, e.g., Alexandroﬀ et al.
2013). Note that the intrinsic line FWHM should be up
to twice larger than estimated here, due to the IGM ab-
sorption.

5.1.6. HSC J2216−0016

This is an unambiguous quasar at z = 6.10, observed
both at GTC and Subaru. The spectrum around the
expected N V λ1240 position (λobs = 8790 ˚A) is heavily
absorbed, likely due to a BAL of the N V line. The small-
scale features of this BAL are very similar in the FOCAS
and OSIRIS spectra, suggesting they are real. We note
that there is no atmospheric absorption features in the
standard star spectrum corresponding to this BAL.

5.1.7. HSC J2228+0128

The redshift measured with Ly α is z = 6.01. The
spectrum is similar to but not as extreme as J2232+0012,
with L(Lyα) ∼ 1043.2 erg s−1, W0(Lyα) ∼ 20 ˚A, and
vFWHM(Lyα) ∼ 250 km s−1. As in J2232+0012, the
luminous Ly α line may be contributed in part by an
AGN.

5.1.8. HSC J1207−0005

The spectrum is very similar to that of the previ-
ous object, J2228+0128. The redshift inferred from
the Ly α line is z = 6.01, while the Ly α properties
are L(Lyα) ∼ 1042.9 erg s−1, W0(Lyα) ∼ 10 ˚A, and
vFWHM(Lyα) ∼ 410 km s−1. While the Ly α emission is
weaker than those in J2232+0012 and J2228+0128, the
relatively large vFWHM(Lyα) may hint at the presence of
AGN contribution.

5.1.9. HSC J1202−0057

This object has a typical quasar spectrum, with strong
and broad Ly α line and blue continuum. The redshift
estimated with Ly α is z = 5.93.

5.2. Notes on the contaminating objects

Figure 5 presents the reduced spectra of the objects
which are not likely to be quasars, based on the ab-
sence of high ionization lines, broad emission lines, or
blue continuum. J0857+0142 and J0215−0555 have nar-
row Ly α lines and sharp continuum breaks character-
istic of GP troughs. The interstellar absorption lines of
Si II λ1260, Si II λ1304, and C II λ1335 are also clearly
visible, which indicate that they are LBGs at z = 5.89
and z = 5.74, respectively. These three absorption
lines may also be present in the spectra of J0219−0416,
J0210−0523, J0210−0559, and J0848+0045, although
the S/N is lower. Combined with the relatively ﬂat
continua and the sharp ﬂux drops in the bluer part
of the spectra, they are likely to be high-z galaxies as
well. Their approximate redshifts were estimated from
the absorption lines. The strong absorption lines created
by the low-ionization species may be useful to estimate
the escape fraction of ionizing photons in these galax-
ies (Jones et al. 2013), which will be addressed in future
work.

It is worth noting that the redshift distribution of these
contaminating galaxies (5.7 < z < 6.0) is systematically
diﬀerent from that of the discovered quasars (5.9 < z <
6.9). This is at least partly because only intrinsically
luminous objects can be detected at z > 6.0, where the
GP trough comes into the z band. It may also reﬂect the
evolution of the luminous end of the galaxy luminosity
function around z ∼ 6.

Finally, J0850+0012 has a relatively smooth red con-
tinuum characteristic of a brown dwarf. Indeed this ob-
ject has a rather low P B

Bayesian algorithm predicts it is most likely a L0 dwarf,
which is consistent with the obtained spectrum. Follow-
up study of this faint dwarf will be presented in a future

5.3. Discussion and future prospects

In summary, we observed 19 out of the 38 Main candi-
dates and identiﬁed 15 new high-z quasars and galaxies.
The above candidates also include 5 previously-known
quasars, recovered by our selection. The current sta-
tus of the spectroscopic identiﬁcations is presented in
Figure 3. Our selection is quite successful at magni-
tudes brighter than zAB = 23.5 mag, where seven out
of the nine candidates have turned out to be quasars
and the remaining two are awaiting spectroscopy. This
implies the following two points. First, the source de-
tection and measurements with the HSC hardware and
reduction software are highly reliable without serious sys-
tematic eﬀects. Second, our quasar selection algorithms
work quite eﬃciently as long as they are fed with correct
photometry information.

Interestingly, we have started to ﬁnd high-z galax-
ies as signiﬁcant contaminants at zAB > 23.5 mag.
This is not surprising, since the luminosity functions
of quasars and LBGs are likely to intersect at ∼ 24
mag, with LBGs outnumbering quasars at fainter mag-
nitudes (see Figure 2 and the discussion in §3). Figure
6 presents the diﬀerence between the PSF and cModel
magnitudes, as a measure of source extendedness, for all
the identiﬁed objects in this work. We found that most
of the objects are consistent with being point sources
(mPSF − mcModel ≃ 0), while the three objects, including
the possible quasar J2232+0012, appear to be extended.
Since the host galaxy contribution is not always negli-
gible for low-luminosity quasars we are looking for, as
we previously mentioned, no clear cut can be deﬁned to
separate quasars and galaxies on this plane.

Meanwhile, the discovered galaxies are an important
probe of the reionization era. For example, stellar pop-
ulations in such high-z bright galaxies can be studied in
detail with high-quality spectra. Measurements of the
interstellar absorption lines such as those observed in
J0857+0142 and J0215−0555 have the potential to con-
strain the escape fraction of ionizing photons as we pre-
viously mentioned. Follow-up observations with facilities
at other wavelengths, e.g., the Atacama Large Millime-
ter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), would also be useful
to understand the nature of these galaxies in the high-z
Universe.

At the faintest magnitudes of our survey (24.0 < zAB <
24.5 mag), the photometric selection and spectroscopic
identiﬁcation become more challenging. Along with the
increasing fraction of galaxies, we found a contaminating
brown dwarf, which is expected from its low Bayesian
quasar probability (P B
Q = 0.17; see §5.2). We were not
able to conﬁrm the nature of two candidates due to their
low spectral S/N, although we typically spent a few hours
per object with Subaru. They seem to have no strong
emission lines and so may be galaxies or brown dwarfs,
but no- or weak-line quasars such as J2236+0032 do ex-

and possible quasars (blue), galaxies (green), and a brown dwarf

quasar, J1205−0000, and in the z band for the remaining objects.
Most of the objects are consistent with being point sources (around
mPSF − mcModel = 0; marked by the dotted line), while the three
objects labelled with their names, including the possible quasar
J2232+0012, appear to be extended.

ist. Further analysis of these objects, possibly with ad-
ditional observing time to increase the S/N, will be pre-
sented in a future paper.

With the ﬁve previously-known objects and the nine
objects (including the possible quasars J2232+0012,
J2228+0128, and J1207−0005) newly identiﬁed, 14 high-
z quasars are now known in the present survey area.
This is roughly half of the expected number with our
survey limit in 80 deg2 (see §2), although the spec-
troscopic identiﬁcation is still not complete.
In the
last column of Table 3, we report the absolute mag-
nitudes of the discovered quasars as well as galaxies.
For quasars, we measure the ﬂux densities at the rest-
frame wavelength λrest = 1270 − 1330 ˚A (except for
J1205 − 0000 with the highest redshift, in which case we
adopt λrest = 1250 − 1260 ˚A) and estimate M1450 assum-
ing the power-law continuum slope α = −1.5 (fλ ∝ λα;
e.g., Vanden Berk et al. 2001). For galaxies, we directly
measure M1350 at λrest = 1320−1380 ˚A. As expected, our
survey has succeeded in identifying quasars (and galax-
ies) with luminosities approaching M1450 ∼ −22 mag,
i.e., ∼2 mag lower luminosity than found in most of the
previous large surveys (see §1).

One important application of the discovered quasars is
to measure the IGM H I opacity, and thus the progress
of reionization, through the GP troughs. We checked
the feasibility of this application by measuring inverse-
variance weighted means of the residual ﬂux in the ob-
tained spectra, in bins of 100 ˚A from λobs = 8000 ˚A to
∼100 ˚A bluewards of Ly α. There are 68 bins in total
for all the quasars, in which (46, 28, 11) bins have more
than (1σ, 2σ, 3σ) ﬂux detection. This suggests that these
sources are potentially suited for IGM opacity measure-
ments, which will be a subject of future work. Note
that high S/N is crucial for robust GP measurements
(White et al. 2003), which will require much longer inte-
gration time than we spent in the discovery observations
for these sources.

We will continue and develop the SHELLQs project as

two sources whose nature is still uncertain due to the
low spectral S/N. In addition to these newly identiﬁed
objects, there are ﬁve quasars known prior to our sur-
vey among the 38 candidates. The success rate of our
selection is quite high, with most of the objects we took
spectra of being identiﬁed as high-z quasars or galaxies.
The SHELLQs project will continue as the HSC-SSP
survey continues toward its goals of observing 1400 deg2
in the Wide layer, as well as 27 and 3.5 deg2 in the
Deep and Ultra-Deep layer, respectively. We will soon
deliver our ﬁrst quasar luminosity function reaching
down to MAB ∼ −22 mag at z ∼ 6. Further follow-
up observations of the discovered quasars and galaxies
are being considered at various wavelengths from sub-
millimeter/radio to X-ray.

the HSC-SSP survey continues. The present work only
partially covers the ﬁrst 80 deg2 of the Wide layer, which
will eventually observe 1,400 deg2. Our immediate goal
is to complete the spectroscopic identiﬁcation in this 80
deg2 area and derive our ﬁrst quasar luminosity func-
tion. In the long term, we will expand the survey area
and signiﬁcantly increase the sample size and luminosity
range of known high-z quasars. As described in §1, the
expected numbers of quasars over the whole Wide area
are ∼500 with zAB < 24.5 mag at z ∼ 6 and ∼100 with
yAB < 24.0 mag at z ∼ 7. We will also explore even
lower luminosities with the Deep and Ultra-Deep layers
of the HSC-SSP survey, though follow-up spectroscopy
will become more challenging.

At the same time, it is important to follow up individ-
ual quasars in greater detail. The redshifts of some of
the discovered quasars are poorly constrained at the mo-
ment, which should be improved. We are also preparing
for deep optical and NIR spectroscopy to measure the
near-zone size, SMBH mass, and metallicity for those
quasars at lower luminosity than previously known at
z > 6. These low-luminosity objects are expected to be
much more numerous than the brighter ones, and hence
possess critical information about the general properties
of quasars in the early Universe. They will also provide a
useful constraint on the low mass end of the SMBH mass
function, and in turn models of the formation and early
evolution of SMBHs. In addition, X-ray observations will
play a critical role to estimate the bolometric luminos-
ity, the Eddington ratio, and the presence and properties
of absorbing material. We also plan to conduct ALMA
follow-up observations in order to study the gas and dust
content as well as the star formation activity in the host
galaxies.

6. SUMMARY

We present initial results from the SHELLQs project, a
survey of low-luminosity quasars and AGNs at high red-
shift close to the reionization era. The project exploits
the exquisite imaging data with ﬁve optical bands (g, r,
i, z, y) produced by the Subaru HSC-SSP survey, sup-
plemented with NIR photometry where available from
UKIDSS and VIKING. The limiting magnitudes of the
quasar search are currently set to zAB < 24.5 mag and
yAB < 24.0 mag, but these may change in the future.
The candidates are selected by combining several pho-
tometric approaches including a Bayesian probabilistic
algorithm, which have turned out to be quite eﬃcient
in eliminating astrophysical contaminants such as stars
and dwarfs, as well as cosmic rays, moving objects, and
transient events. From the early HSC-SSP survey area
covering 80 deg2, we identiﬁed 38 candidates of high-z
quasars, which are the focus of this paper.

We carried out spectroscopic follow-up observations
of 19 of these candidates, with GTC/OSIRIS and Sub-
aru/FOCAS, in the 2015 Fall and 2016 Spring semesters.
Nine objects were identiﬁed as quasars or possible
quasars at 5.9 < z < 6.9, based on the sharp contin-
uum breaks characteristic of GP troughs, broad Lyα and
N V λ1240 lines and/or blue continuum. Six objects are
likely high-z galaxies with interstellar absorption lines of
Si II λ1260, Si II λ1304, and C II λ1335, and in some
cases narrow Lyα emission lines. The remaining objects
include a L0 dwarf, a moving or transient object, and
