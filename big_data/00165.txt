Abstract

We investigate possible cosmological eﬀects of interacting scalar radiation and dark matter. After

its decoupling, scalar radiation can stream freely as neutrinos or self-interact strongly as perfect

ﬂuid, highly depending on the magnitude of its self-couplings. We obtain the general and novel

structure for self-scattering rate and compare it with the expansion rate of our Universe. If its

trilinear/cubic coupling is non-zero, scalar radiation can be eventually treated as perfect ﬂuid.

Possible eﬀects on CMB are also discussed. When this scalar also mediates interaction among

dark matter particles, the linear matter power spectrum for large scale structure can be modiﬁed

diﬀerently from other models. We propose to use Debye shielding to avoid the singularity appearing

in the scattering between scalar radiation and dark matter.

INTRODUCTION

According to our current understanding, nearly 95% of energy density in our universe

consists of dark components, namely dark energy and dark matter. The standard cosmolog-

ical model, a cosmological constant with cold dark matter, called ΛCDM, is very successful

at large scales [1]. At small scales, there are controversies that allow scenarios beyond

collisionless CDM, see Ref. [2] for a recent review.

Although not all of these dark components are necessarily connected, it should not be

very surprising that some could have new interactions. If dark matter has signiﬁcant in-

teractions beyond gravitation, there could be dramatically diﬀerent predictions that can be

tested by observations. For instance, when a light particle mediates the interaction between

dark matter, we can get enhanced annihilation cross section, a possible scenario for positron

fraction excess in cosmic ray data [3]1. If dark matter has large self-interaction, its density

distribution around galactic center tends to have a ﬂat proﬁle [5].

If dark matter inter-

acts with some relativistic particle in cosmic background, matter power spectrum could get

suppressed [6–11], relaxing the “missing satellite” problem [12, 13].

There are various models in particle physics that can provide the above mentioned inter-

action. DM with gauge or global symmetries is extensively discussed in [14–31]. Atomic and

mirror DM can also have similar phenomenology [32–35]. Diﬀerent DM models within super-

symmetric framework are explored in [36, 37]. Closely related model-independent analyses

about eﬀects on astrophysics are conducted in [38–47].

In this paper, we investigate a new, illustrating model with interacting scalar radia-

tion and dark matter, and discuss the possible cosmological eﬀects on cosmic microwave

background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS). Scalars can have cubic and quartic self-

interactions, which can aﬀect their cosmological evolution. If these interactions are small

enough, scalar radiation is streaming freely after decoupling and behaves just as neutrinos.

If these interactions are not negligible, scalar may be treated as perfect ﬂuid and aﬀects

CMB diﬀerently. The interaction between dark matter and scalar radiation also induces

novel temperature dependences in scattering cross section, which are crucial in cosmological

context and lead to imprints on linear power spectrum.

1 The excess can also be explained by models in which DM in scenario with non-standard cosmology and

interactions can have enhanced perturbation at small scales [4]. More substructures or subhalos could

arise and give a large boost factor.

2

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we set the theoretical framework by intro-

ducing the explicit model. Then in Sec. III we investigate how scalar contributes as radiation

by changing the eﬀective number of neutrinos, whether it streams freely or behaves as perfect

ﬂuid, and what the possible eﬀects on CMB. Next in Sec. IV, we consider the cosmological

eﬀects of scattering between DM and scalar radiation. We propose to use Debye shielding

to avoid the singularity appearing in the scattering process. Finally, we give our conclusion.

II.

INTERACTING SCALAR RADIATION AND DARK MATTER

We start with the very simple but general Lagrangian density with (pseudo-)scalars φi

and fermionic dark matter ψ,

L = LSM + ¯ψ(i/∂ − mψ)ψ − ¯ψ(gs

i + igp

(2.1)

where mψ is the mass of ψ, gs

i are respectively the scalar and pseudo-scalar type
coupling constants, and H is the standard model Higgs doublet. Repeated index is summed.

i and gp

We have introduced a set of scalars φi for reasons which we shall discuss shortly.

It is

surprising that the above Lagrangian has not been discussed in the cosmological context.

As we shall show in this paper, such a simple model has some novel features and interesting

implications. Phenomenology with scalar dark matter X can be easily generalized.

Scalars φi can be massive or massless, and the resulting cosmology could be quite diﬀerent.

Throughout our discussion, we shall not specify the fundamental origins of these scalars. In

particle physics, scalars are ubiquous, such as Higgs ﬁeld, axion, inﬂation ﬁeld, bound states,

dark energy, and so on. Without loss of generality, we may ﬁrst discuss the φ part in the
potential V,

(2.2)

where the individual mi, µijk and λijkl can be zero or non-zero. Introduction of interaction
terms with H†H has at least one immediate eﬀects that ψ and φi can be thermalized in the
early Universe.

The relic density of DM ψ is basically determined by the couplings to φi. ψ can be

produced either through usual thermal freeze-out or freeze-in process, it can also produced

by heavy φ’s decay. If ψ and all φi are heavy, say heavier than GeV, phenomenologies in

fermion ψ and scalar φi, respectively.

these aspects are the same as traditional cold dark matter and it makes no diﬀerence in our

model, Eq. 2.1.

However, if there is a light state in φi, although the relic density calculation is probably

only modiﬁed by including Sommerfeld eﬀects [48, 49], there are other very important con-

sequences on cosmological observables, such as CMB and large scale structure (LSS), which

are the main topics in this paper. As we shall show that the details not only depend on the

interaction between DM ψ and φi, but also on self-interaction terms µijk and λijkl.

III. SCALAR RADIATION AND CMB

Assume φ1 is the light state, massless or having a very tiny mass compared with its
temperature (mφ1 (cid:28) Tφ1), one immediate eﬀect is that φ1 will contribute as radiation in
cosmic background. The convenient quantity to account for this contribution is the eﬀective

number of neutrino species, Neﬀ, which describes how much relativistic species are present

in our Universe. φ1 would increase Neﬀ by

where T is the temperature, g∗s counts the eﬀective degrees of freedom for entropy density,

and we have used superscript ‘φ’ to denote the system of ψ and φi and entropy conservation

in the last equality. Although the exact value depends on the kinetic decoupling temperature

T dec and ratios of degrees of freedom before and after decoupling, the typical value for δNeﬀ
would be around O (0.1) which is deﬁnitely allowed by present data [1, 50, 51]. For instance,
if T dec ∼ 1GeV, we have δNeﬀ (cid:39) 0.045. If more than one scalar contributes as radiation, we
should rescale δNeﬀ correspondingly. The exact value of T dec is determined by the interaction

with standard model particle. Simple calculation shows that an interaction term λφHφ2
with λφH ∼ 10−3 would give T dec ∼ 1GeV.

1H†H

We know in standard model neutrinos are decoupled after BBN time and then start free-

streaming, which means the interactions of neutrinos can be neglected so that perturbations

in its anisotropic stress and high multipole can develop. However, in our model φ1 is not

necessarily free-streaming after its kinetic decoupling from standard model thermal bath

and it may self-scatter a lot and acts like a perfect ﬂuid that has no anisotropy and high

multipole. Whether and when φ1 is streaming freely depends crucially on its self-couplings

or interaction with other relativistic particles.

The self-scattering rate of φ1 is dominantly determined by φ1 + φ1 → φ1 + φ1 through
the Feynman diagrams shown in Fig. 2. Deﬁne µ1 ≡ µ111 and λ1 ≡ λ1111, we can estimate
the scattering rate as

The most important features of Eq. 3.2 are the temperature dependences in comparison

with the evolution of Universe. λ-term in Eq. 3.2 with linear temperature dependence

can also be obtained from other interactions, for instance, fermionic radiation with gauge

interactions. While the µ-term with inverse cubic power law, as far as we know, is not

presented elsewhere.

Recall that the expansion rate or typical time scale in cosmic evolution with ﬂat spatial

than H since Γφ1 is decreasing but H is nearly constant.

3. µ1 = 0 and λ1 = 0: φ1 is streaming freely after its kinetic decoupling just like neutrinos

in standard cosmology.

The above discussion can be best illustrated with a schematic plot in Fig. 3, where H and
Γφ1 are shown as functions of photon temperature Tγ in log-scale. As Tγ decreases towards

In Fig. 4, we show the eﬀects δNeﬀ = 0.1 on CMB temperature anisotropy. Dashed (Long-

culating the power spectrum, we have modiﬁed the public Boltzmann code CLASS-2.4.3 [52].

For the perfect ﬂuid case, the maximal eﬀect arise when radiation starts to behave as perfect

ﬂuid in radiation dominate era. In other instances, it will lie in the middle of perfect ﬂuid

and free-streaming. In the upper plot, we see that it is almost indistinguishable from the
standard ΛCDM due to relative small diﬀerence at order of O(1%), shown in the lower plot.
It is expected that in future CMB experiment high precision measurement would be able to

resolve the diﬀerence.

IV.

INTERACTING DARK MATTER AND LSS

In this section, we shall investigate cosmological eﬀects of the interaction between DM

ψ and scalar radiation φi. The overall relic density of DM ψ has already been discussed in

Sec. II. Here we shall only focus on the eﬀects from elastic scattering between DM and φ1.
Before ψ’s kinetic decoupling, elastic scattering, ψ + φ1 → ψ + φ1, keeps ψ in equilibrium
with φ1. The scattering rate is given by the calculation of Feynman diagrams in Fig. 5. The
ﬁrst two diagrams, (a) and (b), mimic the Compton scattering, e− + γ → e− + γ, while the

last one (c) gives some unique features and has no equivalent in other models.

The scattering rate of contributions from (a) and (b) in Fig. 5 have the following behavior,

second term depends on temperature quadratically. Such temperature dependences are

typically studied [53] for DM models with vector or scalar mediator.

In our considered

model, Eq. 2.1, we have an additional diagram, Fig. 5(c), which as we shall show below, has

totally diﬀerent behavior.

The contribution from the last one, (c), is given by

where we see again that inverse power-law arises, due to exchanging of φ1, similar to µ-term

in Eq. 3.2. When obtaining the above equations, we have neglected some numeric factors

which again do not aﬀect qualitatively the physical eﬀects. We also notice that scalar and

pseudoscalar interactions have diﬀerent temperature dependence in cosmological evolution.
For scalar dark matter, we do not have the gp

1-term in Eq. 4.1 and Eq. 4.2.

The cosmological eﬀects from the elastic scattering is that collisional damping will be

induced on matter power spectrum. Typically, oscillation behavior should arise, similar to

baryonic acoustic oscillation. The momentum relaxation rate [8–11] determining the kinetic

decoupling of ψ-φ1 is given by

γ (Tψ) ≡

Tψ
mψ × Γψφ1,

and should be compared with Hubble parameter H. If γ (Tψ) decreases more quickly than
H does as shown in Eq. 4.1, then at lower temperature kinetic decoupling happens when
γ (Tψ) (cid:46) H (Tkd). The corresponding collisional damping scale manifests itself as a charac-

teristic scale in the matter power spectrum with

where ρM is the sum of matter densities, ρCDM+ρbaryon. Below this scale, the power spectrum
is suppressed, see Fig. 6 for a quick glimpse. Interestingly, if Mc ∼ O(109)M(cid:12), it might be
able to resolve the “missing satellites” problem.

However, if Γc

or µ1 in Eq. 4.2 is non-zero, γ/H can actually increasing as our universe
cools down due to the inverse power-law temperature dependence. In such a case, matter

power spectrum at very large scale could also be aﬀected. To show quantitative results,

we need solve the cosmological perturbation evolutions for ψ and φ1. Explicitly, similar to

ΛCDM cosmology which other lines are labeled with diﬀerent β and u0 deﬁned in Eq. 4.6.

With positive β, the matter power spectra are aﬀected more in the large k or small scales,

while negative β can modify also very large scales or small k region. All these behaviors are

expected as we explain above under Eqs. 4.1 and 4.2. To make quantitative constraints on

the cross section, one need to conduct Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, which is beyond

our scope here.

There is one more important feature we would like to take a close look. When calculating

the diﬀerential scattering cross section in Fig. 5(c) for ψ + φ1 → ψ + φ1, we have

and (1 − cos θ) ∼ 1. However, there is actually singularity near cos θ = 1, which is the
infrared divergence, common in quantum ﬁeld theories with massless particles. θ = 0 means

zero-momentum transfer or inﬁnite long range interaction but without scattering. So, this
singular region have no eﬀect on ψ − φ1 scattering, similar to Rutherford scattering in
quantum electrodynamics. For our purpose here, one straightforward way to get rid of the

singularity is just to introduce a small mass for φ1 so that there is a ﬁnite length beyond

eﬀectively shield the interaction between φ1 and ψ, similar to a phenomena called Debye

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have investigate some plausible cosmological eﬀects from interacting

scalar radiation and dark matter (DM). After its kinetic decoupling, scalar radiation can be

streaming freely as standard neutrino or interacting strongly as perfect ﬂuid, which leads

to distinguishable eﬀects on cosmic microwave background. When scalar radiation can be

treated as perfect ﬂuid depends on the self-interaction strength. If its trilinear or cubic term

is non-vanishing, massless scalar eventually behaves as perfect ﬂuid.

The frequent scattering between DM and scalar radiation leaves imprint on the matter

power spectrum which is an important probe in large scale structure. This scattering can

decay the kinetic decoupling of DM and give rise to collisional damping or oscillation in DM

density perturbation, similar to baryonic acoustic oscillation. The suppression in matter

power spectrum might be test with future experiment. We also identify a novel structure of

temperature dependence in the scattering amplitude where singularity appears. We propose

use Deybe shielding to avoid this singular problem.
