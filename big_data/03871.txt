ABSTRACT. We study the minimizers of the sum of the principal Dirichlet eigenvalue of the
negative Laplacian and the perimeter with respect to a general norm in the class of Jordan domains
in the plane. This is equivalent (modulo scaling) to minimizing the said eigenvalue (or the base
frequency of a drum of this shape) subject to a hard constraint on the perimeter. We show that, for
all norms, a minimizer exists, is unique up to spatial translations and is convex but not necessarily
smooth. We give conditions on the norm that characterize the appearance of facets and corners.
We also demonstrate that near minimizers have to be close to the optimal ones in the Hausdorff
distance. Our motivation for considering this class of variational problems comes from a study of
random walks in random environment interacting through the boundary of their support.

1. MAIN RESULTS

The aim of this paper is to analyze the planar domains that minimize the principal harmonic
frequency (i.e., the lowest Dirichlet eigenvalue of the negative Laplacian or the base frequency
of the drum of this shape) subject to a hard constraint on the perimeter deﬁned using a general
norm. Let us introduce the problem and state our results on it ﬁrst and leave the discussion of our
motivation as well as connections to existing literature to a later section.

1.1 The model and main theorems.

We will consider the following class of admissible domains

U :=(cid:8)U ⊂ R2 : Jordan domain,0 ∈ U(cid:9).
(cid:110)(cid:107)∇g(cid:107)2

(1.1)
Note that each U ∈ U is open, bounded, connected and simply connected with ∂U being the
trace of a simple closed curve. The principal Dirichlet eigenvalue of the negative Laplacian is for
any open U ⊂ R2 given by

λ (U) := inf

(1.2)
where (cid:107)·(cid:107)2 denotes the L2 norm on R2 with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Next ﬁx a norm ρ
on R2 and denote by γ : [0,1] → R2 the curve constituting ∂U (where γ(0) = γ(1)). Then we

Our main point of interest are the minimizers of λ (U) subject to the constraint P(U) = a.

Instead of dealing with the hard constraint, throughout this paper we will focus on minimizing

the functional

F (U) := λ (U) + P(U)

(1.4)

over all sets U ∈ U . Our main result concerning this problem is as follows:
Theorem 1.1 (Existence and uniqueness of minimizers) For any choice of the norm ρ, the
functional U (cid:55)→ F (U) achieves its minimum on U . Moreover, the minimizer is unique modulo
translates: There is U0 ∈ U such that

M :=(cid:8)U ∈ U : F (U) = min F(cid:9) =(cid:8)x +U0 : − x ∈ U0

(cid:9).

(1.5)

The set U0 is convex and has all symmetries of R2 that preserve ρ.
To see that this does resolve also the problem with the hard constraint on the perimeter we note
that the sheer existence of a minimizer U0 of F implies

inf(cid:8)λ (U): P(U) = P(U0)(cid:9) = λ (U0).

(1.6)

In light of (1.5) and the scaling relations

λ (tU) = t−2λ (U)

(1.7)
where tU := {tx: x ∈ U}, every minimizer of λ (U) subject to P(U) = a is then a translate of tU0
where t := a/P(U0).

and P(tU) = tP(U),

three examples where U0 can explicitly be found:

A natural next problem is the determination of the shape U0 for speciﬁc choices of ρ. Here are
(1) ρ := Euclidean norm ⇒ U0 = a Euclidean ball,
(2) ρ := (cid:96)1-norm ⇒ U0 = an (cid:96)∞-ball,
(3) ρ := (cid:96)∞-norm ⇒ U0 = an (cid:96)1-ball,
see Remark 2.2 for a justiﬁcation.
Recall that non-empty open sets U,V ⊂ R2 are said to be homothetic if we have U = x + tV
for some x ∈ R2 and some t > 0 and let |U| denote the Lebesgue measure of U. Comparing (1-3)
above with the isoperimetric problem for the perimeter deﬁned using the norm ρ,

inf(cid:8)P(U): U ∈ U , |U| = 1(cid:9),
which is solved (see Taylor [19, 20]) by translates of t(cid:101)U0 where
(cid:8)x ∈ R2 : x· y < ρ(y)(cid:9)
(cid:101)U0 :=
and t is such that |(cid:101)U0| = 1, it may come as a surprise that in each of the three cases above the

minimizers of (1.4) are homothetic to the minimizers of (1.8). However, the above examples are
very special and the connection fails in general:

(cid:92)

(1.8)

(1.9)

EIGENVALUES UNDER PERIMETER CONSTRAINT

Theorem 1.2 There exists a norm ρ on R2 such that the minimizer U0 is not homothetic to the
(unique) minimizer of (1.8). In fact, if the norm is smooth outside the origin and ∂U0 is C2, then
the minimizers of (1.4) and (1.8) are homothetic if and only if U0 is a Euclidean ball and ρ is
proportional to the Euclidean norm.

One can also wonder about the analytic form of the dependence of the minimizer of U0 on
the underlying norm ρ. Related to this is the question whether, and by what quantitative means,
the near minimizers are close to the actual minimizers. We will measure this closeness using the
Hausdorff metric

distH(A,B) := max

|x− y|2,sup
x∈B

inf

|x− y|2

(1.10)

where |·|2 will henceforth denote the Euclidean norm on R2. We then have:
Theorem 1.3 (Continuity of minimizers in Hausdorff metric) Recall the notation M from (1.5).
For each ε > 0 there is δ > 0 such that, for each U ∈ U ,

distH(U, M ) > ε ⇒ F (U) ≥ min F + δ .

(1.11)
Moreover, if we center U0 so that U0 = −U0 and then regard it as an element of the metric
space (U ,distH) and ρ as an element of the space of continuous functions on the unit (Euclidean)
sphere in R2 endowed with the supremum norm, then U0 depends continuously on ρ.

We remark that (1.11) is analogous to the Bonnesen inequality known from the context of the
isoperimetric problem. (A formulation of this inequality for perimeters deﬁned using a general
norm has been given by Dobrushin, Koteck´y and Shlosman [8, Chapter 2].) The only quantitative
connection we know of between the shape and the norm requires passage through the correspond-
ing eigenfunction (see Remarks 2.2–2.3) and thus remains quite inexplicit.

1.2 Facets and corners.

Our next item of concern is the appearance of facets and corners on the boundary of U0. Here a
facet is a maximal (with respect to inclusion) non-trivial closed linear segment contained in ∂U0.
A corner is in turn a point on ∂U0, regarded as an oriented curve, where the unit tangent vector
undergoes a jump. (By convexity of U0, the left and right unit tangent is well deﬁned at all points
of ∂U0.)
We will link the facets of U0 to (what we will call) degenerate directions of ρ. To deﬁne this
concept, ﬁx ρ and let e and e(cid:48) be two orthogonal unit vectors. By the triangle inequality, the
function s (cid:55)→ ρ(e + se(cid:48)) is convex and so the one-sided derivatives

θ± :=

d

ds± ρ(e + se(cid:48))

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s=0

are well deﬁned. As an immediate consequence of the deﬁnitions we obtain

− ρ(e(cid:48)) ≤ θ− ≤ θ + ≤ ρ(e(cid:48))

and if we mark the dependence on e and e(cid:48) explicitly as θ±(e,e(cid:48)), we also have
θ +(e,−e(cid:48)) = −θ−(e,e(cid:48)) = −θ−(−e,−e(cid:48)) = θ +(−e,e(cid:48)).

(1.12)

(1.13)

(1.14)

4

BISKUP AND PROCACCIA

In particular, the difference θ +(e,e(cid:48))−θ−(e,e(cid:48)) is preserved under the reversal of the orientation
of any (or both) of the vectors e and e(cid:48). We now put forward:
Deﬁnition 1.4 (Degenerate direction) Let e be a unit vector and e(cid:48) a unit vector orthogonal to e.
Given a norm ρ on R2, we say that e is degenerate for ρ if

θ +(e,e(cid:48))− θ−(e,e(cid:48)) > 0.

(1.15)

We then claim:

Theorem 1.5 (Facets equivalent to degeneracy) Let U0 ∈ U be the (unique, convex) minimizing
shape of U (cid:55)→ F (U) for F deﬁned using a norm ρ. Let e be a unit vector in R2. Then the
curve constituting ∂U0 contains a non-trivial linear segment in the direction of e if and only if e
is degenerate for ρ.

As is easy to check, the (cid:96)1-norm has ±2−1/2(e1± e2) as its degenerate directions, and this will
remain in effect even when we add an arbitrary norm to the (cid:96)1-norm. By adding appropriately
weighted rotations of the (cid:96)1-norm, we can thus construct a norm whose minimizing shape will
have inﬁnitely many facets.

Let us now move to the appearance of corners. Pick U ∈ U and let t (cid:55)→ γ(t) be the parame-
terization of ∂U by the Euclidean arc-length in the counterclockwise direction. If U is convex,
then γ is right/left differentiable which means that

v±(x) :=

d
dt± γ(t), where

(1.16)
exist with the vectors ν±(x) having unit Euclidean norm. Note that, since the deﬁnition is for a
ﬁxed parametrization of the curve, we may and will regard v± as functions of x ∈ ∂U.
Deﬁnition 1.6 We say that a convex set U ∈ U has a corner at a point x0 ∈ ∂U0 if

x := γ(t),

v+(x0) (cid:54)= v−(x0)

(1.17)

We then have:

Theorem 1.7 (Corners and strict convexity of the norm) Let ρ be a norm on R2 and let U0 be a
(convex) minimizer of U (cid:55)→ F (U) for the norm ρ. If U0 has a corner at a point x0 ∈ ∂U0, then ρ
and the vectors v± := v±(x0) must obey

ρ(av− + bv+) = aρ(v−) + bρ(v+),

(1.18)
On the other hand, if (1.18) holds for two distinct unit vectors ν +,ν− ∈ R2, then there is a point
x0 ∈ ∂U0 such that ν±(x0) = ν± and U0 thus has a corner at x0. In particular, ∂U0 is continuously
differentiable if and only if ρ is strictly convex.

a,b ≥ 0.

By the symmetries of the norm, if U0 is centered and has a corner at x0 with tangent vectors ν±,
then it also has a corner at −x0 with tangent vectors −ν±. However, this does not imply that U0 is
a parallelogram as that would require (1.18) for all a,b ∈ R. In fact, there are norms for which U0
has corners and yet no facets at all. This is best seen from the fact that the above characteriza-
tions of facets and corners (including the proofs thereof) apply equally well to the isoperimetric

EIGENVALUES UNDER PERIMETER CONSTRAINT

problem (1.8). There we can enforce the desired features of the minimizing shape (cid:101)U0 from (1.9)
directly and then extract ρ by the duality transformation ρ(x) := sup{x· y: y ∈ (cid:101)U0}.

2. EARLIER WORK, KEY IDEAS, REMARKS AND OUTLINE

Having introduced the problem and stated the main results, let us now discuss brieﬂy the context
of this work including the prior literature on the subject. We will then also outline the key ideas
and give a list of remarks and directions for possible extensions.

2.1 Earlier work.

Shape optimization for Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplacian has been a topic of considerable
interest in recent years. Early work focused on optimizing the eigenvalues under a constraint on
the Lebesgue volume. Here the case of the principal eigenvalue goes back to Faber and Krahn’s
solution of the problem posed by Lord Rayleigh in his “Theory of Sound.” The case of higher
eigenvalues has been resolved only in the last 10-15 years; see, e.g., the books by Henrot [15]
and Velichkov [22] for details as well as some historical perspective.

More recently, attempts have been made to ﬁnd shapes optimizing Dirichlet eigenvalues of the
Laplacian subject to other types of constraints than volume. In particular, this includes constraints
on the perimeter. The relevant references are the papers of Bucur and Freitas [5], Bucur, Butazzo
and Henrot [4], van den Berg and Inversen [21] and de Philippis and Velichkov [7]. However,
all of these works focus solely on the perimeter deﬁned using the Euclidean norm and, since this
makes the case of the principal eigenvalue directly solvable, on higher-order eigenvalues.

Our interest in perimeters that are deﬁned using non-isotropic norms arises from a study of a
random walk on Z2 that (self-)interacts through the size of its boundary. As a result of the inter-
action, the random walk gets squeezed to a subdiffusive spatial scale. Berestycki and Yadin [2],
who introduced this problem in the ﬁrst place, identiﬁed the typical diameter of the support of
the walk for large times. In [3], the present authors show that (in the limit of large times and
vanishing temperatures) the asymptotic shape of the visited set is given by minimizing the func-
tional (1.4) for a suitably deﬁned underlying norm ρ. This norm is model dependent, invariably
non-isotropic (due to persistent lattice structure) and exhibiting degenerate directions as well as
directions where strict convexity fails. Hence our interest in the understanding of the resulting
effects on the shape of the minimizer.

2.2 Main ideas and their limitations.

Let us now move to discuss some aspects of the proofs in the present paper. Some of these are
fairly straightforward (e.g., the existence and convexity of a minimizing set) but others require
novel and (we think) interesting ideas. One such case is the proof of uniqueness (up to translates)
of the minimizing set which is based on a convexity argument with respect to the Minkowski
addition of sets: For U,V ⊂ R2 and α ∈ [0,1], let

(2.1)

(2.2)

αU + (1− α)V :=(cid:8)αx + (1− α)y: x ∈ U, y ∈ V(cid:9).
λ(cid:0)αU + (1− α)V(cid:1) ≤ αλ (U) + (1− α)λ (V ),

α ∈ [0,1],

For convex U and V the principal eigenvalue turns out to be convex,

6

BISKUP AND PROCACCIA

and, in fact, strictly so for α ∈ (0,1) unless the sets U and V are homothetic (see Lemma 3.10
whose proof we extract from Colesanti [6]). The perimeter is afﬁne (for convex U and V ),

P(cid:0)αU + (1− α)V(cid:1) = αP(U) + (1− α)P(V ),

(2.3)
(cf Lemma 3.11), and so this leads to a type of strict convexity for U (cid:55)→ F (U) that rules out
simultaneous occurrence of two non-homothetic minimizers.
The proof of uniqueness via the stated convexity argument is exactly what forces us to restrict
attention to spatial dimension d = 2. Indeed, the perimeter is no longer afﬁne in d ≥ 3 and, in
fact, the inequality one ﬁnds in counterexamples (see Remark 3.12) shows that U (cid:55)→ F (U) is
not convex with respect to Minkowski set addition in d ≥ 3. (In these dimensions, taking the
convex hull does not necessarily decrease the perimeter and so even showing that the minimizer
is convex constitutes a non-trivial problem; cf Bucur, Buttazo and Henrot [4].)

α ∈ [0,1],

We remark that the results on higher-order eigenvalues (for Euclidean perimeter) in the afore-
mentioned references [4,5,7,21] above do not seem to address uniqueness of a minimizing shape
at all. Unfortunately, our method does not appear to contribute in this context either.

Another aspect where our results are limited to d = 2 is the control of the Hausdorff distance
to the minimizing set using the value of F . Indeed, similarly to the isoperimetric problem (1.8),
one can fairly easily ﬁnd a sequence of sets in d ≥ 3 whose F -value approaches the minimum
and yet the sets stay a uniform Hausdorff distance away from the class M of the minimizing sets.
(Here the ρ-perimeter of U ∈ Rd for d ≥ 3 is deﬁned as

(cid:90)

ρ(n(x))Hd−1

P(U) :=

(2.4)
∂U is the (d − 1)-dimensional Hausdorff mea-
where n(x) is the normal vector to ∂U at x and Hd−1
sure on ∂U.) A technical reason for the restriction to d = 2 is that our proof of Theorem 1.3 is
conveniently based on a theorem of ˇSver´ak [18] that provides continuity of the principal eigen-
value under (properly formulated) Hausdorff convergence, but only in d = 2.

∂U (dx)

∂U

Both the uniqueness of the minimizer and the control of the Hausdorff distance to the min-
imizers by the value of the functional F are crucial for the application of the above results in
the context of the above mentioned random walk problem [3]. The same applies to our char-
acterization of facets/corners appearing on the minimizing shape. Such features have been of
large interest in probabilistic shape theorems (e.g., the recent review by Aufﬁnger, Damron and
Hanson [1] of shape theorems in ﬁrst passage percolation).

2.3 Further remarks.

We continue with ﬁve remarks. The ﬁrst one addresses certain limitations that were built into the
setting of the very problem:
Remark 2.1 Recall that we look for minimizers only in the class of Jordan domains, which
are in particular simply connected, connected and with the boundary being the trace of a simple
curve. Here are some reasons why we chose this setting.

Simple connectedness is necessary for uniqueness: Removing an isolated point or, in general,
a small-enough polar set changes neither the principal eigenvalue nor the perimeter of the set. The
restriction to connectedness is more or less an irreducibility statement: The principal eigenvalue
of a set with more than one connected components is the minimum of the eigenvalues in the

EIGENVALUES UNDER PERIMETER CONSTRAINT

7

individual components. Dropping all but the minimizing component decreases the perimeter.
Finally, the restriction to domains whose boundary is a simple curve is a matter of convenience;
particularly, in the deﬁnition of the perimeter using the classical arc-length formula (1.3).

The other two remarks are concerned with a direct characterization of the minimizing sets.

Remark 2.2 In some special cases (as noted above), the minimizer U0 can be characterized ex-
plicitly. For instance, if ρ is the Euclidean norm, the Faber-Krahn and isoperimetric inequalities
imply that, in the class of sets with a given Lebesgue volume, both the eigenvalue and the perime-
ter are minimized by the Euclidean ball. By some scaling arguments, the same then applies to the
sum thereof. For the (cid:96)1, resp., (cid:96)∞ norm, the minimizer is an (cid:96)∞, resp., (cid:96)1 ball. This follows by the
dual relation of these norms and the monotonicity of the eigenvalue in the underlying set.

Unfortunately, unlike for the isoperimetric problem (1.8) where the minimizing shape is simply
a ball in the dual norm, for general norm ρ we do not seem to have a way to describe the min-
imizing set U0 directly. For smooth norms with smooth minimizing shape, variational calculus
shows that the minimizing shape satisﬁes

= Cρ (x),

x ∈ ∂U0,

(2.5)

(cid:12)(cid:12)∇hU0(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

where hU denotes the normalized principal eigenfunction of the Laplacian in U and Cρ (x) is the
curvature of ∂U0 at point x relative to the arc-length deﬁned by the norm ρ; see the proof of
Theorem 1.2 in Section 4.3. This generally leads to an overdetermined elliptic problem that we
do not see prospects of it being explicitly solvable except for one case: ρ = Euclidean norm.
Remark 2.3 Instead of relying on variational calculus, one might try to mimic the proof that the
isoperimetric set for ρ-perimeter is a dilation of the support set of the norm ρ. One is prompted
to try this by the fact that the main tool of this proof, the Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the
Lebesgue volume, generalizes to the principal eigenvalue of the Laplacian. Indeed, Colesanti [6]
showed that for any bounded, open and convex U,V ⊂ Rd,

λ (U +V )−1/2 ≥ λ (U)−1/2 + λ (V )−1/2.

This leads to the following inequality for any bounded open and convex U,V ⊂ Rd:

(2.7)

where nU (x) denotes the normal to ∂U at point x, τU (n) := inf{x · n: x ∈ U} and Hd−1
∂U is the
(d − 1)-dimensional Hausdorff measure on ∂U. The point where this approach currently runs
into a dead end is the appearance of the eigenfunctions hV and hU, which seem to prevent us from
interpreting the integral as a perimeter functional in (2.4).

Finally, we want to make the following notes on the qualitative nature of our conclusions:

Remark 2.4 Our proof of Theorem 1.5 links degenerate directions to facets. However, the
argument is not quantitive and so we do not know how the size of the facet depends on the size
of θ + − θ−. Progress on this questions may be of interest.

8

BISKUP AND PROCACCIA

Remark 2.5 Our proof of Theorem 1.3 goes through a limit argument and thus gives no spe-
ciﬁc relation between ε and δ . It would be interesting to derive a quantitative (Bonnesen-like)
inequality between distH(U, M ) and some function of F (U)− F (U0).

2.4 Outline.

The remainder of this paper is devoted to the proof of the above results. The strategy is as
follows: In Section 3 we ﬁrst establish the existence of a convex minimizer and then use the
aforementioned argument to show that the convex minimizer is unique up to spatial shifts. This
proves Theorem 1.1. We then also control the continuity in the underlying norm and rule out
non-convex minimizers (and thus prove Theorem 1.3).

In Section 4 we address the criteria for existence/absence of facets (proving Theorem 1.5)
and relate appearance of corners to non-strict convexity of the norm (proving Theorem 1.7). In
addition, we also give an explicit example of a norm for which the isoperimetric shape differs
from the minimizer of F , and prove that these are generically different in the class of smooth
norms with smooth minimizers (proving Theorem 1.2).

3. EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS OF MINIMIZERS

We are now ready to begin the proofs of our main results. Here we will show all needed facts
underlying the proofs of Theorem 1.1 and 1.3.

3.1 Reduction to convex sets.

Recall the notation F (U) for the function in (1.4) and U for the class of admissible domains
in (1.1). The key point of this subsection is the observation that, as far as ﬁnding a minimizer is
concerned, we can safely restrict attention to convex sets:

Proposition 3.1 Let ρ be any norm on R2. Given U ∈ U , let (cid:98)U denote the convex hull of U.
Then (cid:98)U ∈ U and F ((cid:98)U) ≤ F (U).

We begin with a lemma that gives a priori estimates on the volume and the perimeter of sets

we need to consider. These will be used later in our proofs.
Lemma 3.2 Let ρ be an arbitrary norm on R2. Then

(3.1)
and there are constants c1,c2,c3,c4 ∈ (0,∞) such that the inﬁmum problem is not affected by
restricting to sets satisfying

inf{F (U): U ∈ U } > 0

c1 ≤ |U| ≤ c2

c3 ≤ |∂U| ≤ c4,
where |∂U| denotes the perimeter of U in the Euclidean norm on R2.
Proof. Let ρmin, resp., ρmax denote the minimal, resp., maximal value of ρ(x) for x on the unit
Euclidean sphere in R2. Then

and

(3.2)

ρmin|∂U| ≤ P(U) ≤ ρmax|∂U|,

(3.3)

EIGENVALUES UNDER PERIMETER CONSTRAINT

9

so it sufﬁces to prove the lemma just for the Euclidean norm. Here the 2-dimensional Faber-Krahn
inequality states

λ (U) ≥ c
|U| ,

|∂U| ≥ c(cid:48)|U|1/2,

(3.4)

(3.6)

(3.7)

where c is the value of λ (U) for U being a disc of unit Lebesgue area, while the isoperimetric
inequality yields

approximation of ∂U of at least that much length. Although this appears intuitively obvious, a

(3.5)
where c(cid:48) is the Euclidean perimeter of a disc of the unit area. Putting these bounds together, an
upper bound on F (U) thus yields both upper and lower bounds on |U|. The above then extend
these to upper and lower bounds on |∂U| as well.
(cid:3)
The main step of the proof of Proposition 3.1 is that fact that (in d = 2), taking the convex hull
does not increase the perimeter of the set. To prove this fact we have to show that every polygonal

approximation of the boundary of the convex hull(cid:98)U of a set U ∈ U can be reduced to a polygonal

Lemma 3.3 Let U ∈ U and let (cid:98)U be the convex hull of U. Then (cid:98)U is open and, in fact,
In particular, (cid:98)U is connected. Moreover, if A denotes the set of extremal points of the closure
of (cid:98)U, then A ⊂ ∂U while ∂(cid:98)U (cid:114) A is the disjoint union of open linear segments in R2 with both

is a (continuous) simple closed curve such that(cid:98)γ([0,1]) = ∂(cid:98)U. In particular, (cid:98)U ∈ U .
Proof. The fact that (cid:98)U is open and connected follows directly from the deﬁnitions (and the fact
that U is open). To get (3.6) we note that if x ∈ (cid:98)U is written as x = ty + (1−t)z for some y,z ∈ U

Pick x ∈ A and note that x ∈ ∂(cid:98)U implies, by the fact that U is open and U ⊂ (cid:98)U, that x /∈ U. But
any point in cl((cid:98)U) is in the convex hull of cl(U) and so x (cid:54)∈ ∂U would imply that x is a non-trivial
To ﬁnish the proof, note that any x ∈ ∂(cid:98)U (cid:114) A must be written as a non-trivial convex combina-
tion of exactly two distinct elements from A (otherwise x would be in the interior of (cid:98)U) and so it
lies in an open linear segment connecting these two points. By continuity, IA is thus closed and(cid:98)γ

Lemma 3.4 Let U ∈ U and let (cid:98)U be the convex hull of U. Then, for the perimeter deﬁned using
any norm on R2, we have P((cid:98)U) ≤ P(U).
Proof. Let γ be a curve parametrizing ∂U and let the set A and curve (cid:98)γ be as in Lemma 3.3.
First we claim that P((cid:98)U) can be computed by considering only partitions such that γ(ti) ∈ A for
each i. Indeed, consider a partition such that(cid:98)γ(ti) is not extremal in cl(U) for some i. Then, by
Lemma 3.3,(cid:98)γ(ti) lies in the interior of a linear segment on ∂(cid:98)U. Adding the end-points of this
point(cid:98)γ(ti) leaves the sum unchanged. Proceeding inductively, every partition can be turned into

By the above argument, we may assume that (cid:98)γ(ti) ∈ A for all i. But then γ(ti) =(cid:98)γ(ti) by the
deﬁnition of(cid:98)γ and so the sum on the left is no more than P(U). Hence, P((cid:98)U) ≤ P(U).
λ ((cid:98)U) ≤ λ (U). The claim then follows from Lemma 3.4.

Proof of Proposition 3.1. By the variational characterization of the principal eigenvalue we have

3.2 Minimizer among convex sets: existence.
We will now proceed to prove the existence of a minimizer of U (cid:55)→ F (U) in the class of convex
sets. The arguments in this section are quite standard — we basically just need to prove lower
semicontinuity of U (cid:55)→ F (U) over the class of convex sets. Still, we provide detailed proofs as
we do not ﬁnd all of them satisfactorily worked out in the literature.
Proposition 3.5 There exists a convex set U ∈ U such that F (U) = inf{F (U(cid:48)): U(cid:48) ∈ U }.

We begin with a simple observation, whose proof is probably well known:

Lemma 3.6 Let U,V ∈ U be convex and (recalling that 0 ∈ U,V ) let dist2(0,∂U) denote the
Euclidean distance of 0 to ∂U. Then

holds for any ε > distH(U,V )/dist2(0,∂U) with ε < 1.

(1− ε)U ⊆ V ⊆ (1 + ε)U

Proof. For any r > 0, let B(r) denote the open Euclidean ball of radius r centered at 0 and
pick δ > distH(U,V ). The deﬁnition of the Hausdorff distance (1.10) implies

V ⊆ U + B(δ )

and U ⊆ V + B(δ ).

The inequality on the right is then nearly immediate: Abbreviate rU := dist2(0,∂U). Then

V ⊆ U + B(δ ) = U + δ r−1

U B(rU ) ⊆ U + δ r−1

U U,

where we used that B(rU ) ⊆ U.

For the inequality on the left, we will ﬁrst prove that, for any δ > 0,

rV +B(δ ) ≤ rV + δ .

(3.12)

EIGENVALUES UNDER PERIMETER CONSTRAINT

(In fact, equality holds here and is easy to prove, but inconsequential for us.) Indeed, let x0 be
the point on ∂V such that rV equals the Euclidean norm |x0|. Set H := {x ∈ R2 : x· x0 < r2
V}. The
convexity of V then forces V ⊆ H. Hence V + B(δ ) ⊆ H + B(δ ) and so rV +B(δ ) is at most the
distance of 0 to the boundary of H + B(δ ) and (3.12) thus holds.

To ﬁnish the proof of the main claim, let again δ > distH(U,V ) but now assume also δ < rU.
(This is possible else there is no ε to apply the statement to.) By the inclusion on the right of (3.9)
(which we already proved above),

(3.13)
But the second inclusion in (3.10) gives rU ≤ rV +B(δ ) and from (3.12) we then get rU ≤ rV + δ .
This yields

and, by a simple rescaling of (3.13), we then get the inclusion on the left (3.9) as well.

(cid:3)
We remark that (3.12) is easily invalidated for U or V non-convex. As a consequence of

Lemma 3.6, we get:
Lemma 3.7 Let {Un} ⊂ U and U ∈ U be convex sets. Then

distH(Un,U) −→
n→∞

0 ⇒ lim
n→∞

λ (Un) = λ (U).

(3.15)

Proof. This statement is well known, e.g., Henrot [15, Theorem 2.3.15], but we provide a proof
as it is easy and instructive: Lemma 3.6 implies that, for each ε > 0 small enough,

(1− ε)U ⊂ Un ⊂ (1 + ε)U

(3.16)
once n is large. Using this in (1.2) along with the scaling relation (1.7) shows λ (Un) → λ (U). (cid:3)
For the perimeter we only get a statement of lower semicontinuity with respect to Hausdorff
convergence (on convex sets). For the sake of later applications, we will also allow the underlying
norm to vary with n.
Lemma 3.8 Let ρn be a sequence of norms converging, if regarded as continuous functions on
the unit circle in R2, uniformly to a norm ρ. Let Pn, resp., P denote the perimeter with respect
to ρn, resp., ρ, and let {Un} ⊂ U and U ∈ U be convex sets. Then

(3.17)

Moreover, for any U ∈ U convex,

(3.18)
Proof. Let γ : [0,1] → R2 be the curve parametrizing ∂U using the polar angle (in units of 2π)
as viewed from 0, and let γn be the corresponding parametrization of ∂Un. Pick a collection of
points 0 = t0 < t1 < ··· < tm = 1. Lemma 3.6 shows

Pn(U) = P(U).

for n large thus proving also (3.18).

For the second part of the claim, the convergence of ρn to ρ on the unit circle is actually

uniform which after a moment’s though gives that, for each ε > 0,

F (Un) −→
n→∞

inf{F (U): U ∈ U }

(3.23)
By Lemma 3.2 we may assume that {Un} obey the bounds in (3.2) and, in particular, are uniformly
bounded. Moreover, by Proposition 3.1 we may assume that Un are convex. By Lemma 3.2 there
is an r > 0 such that each Un contains an open disc of radius r (otherwise |∂Un| is larger than order
|U|/r). Applying a suitable shift to each Un we may thus assume dist2(0,∂Un) ≥ r for each n.

Reducing to a subsequence if necessary, the Blaschke Selection Theorem (or a direct argument
using the polar-angle parameterization used in the proof of Lemma 3.8) permits us to assume
that {Un} converge in the Hausdorff distance to an open (by our choice) set U. Clearly, U is also
convex and thus connected and, by the above centering assumption, 0 ∈ U. Lemmas 3.7–3.8 then
give F (U) ≤ liminfn→∞ F (Un). Hence, U is a minimizer.
(cid:3)

3.3 Minimizer among convex sets: uniqueness.

Since we have already proved the existence of a minimizer, we will henceforth write min F
for the inﬁmum in the statement of Proposition 3.5. Our next task is to show that the convex
minimizer is actually unique modulo translation:
Proposition 3.9 There is a convex set U0 ∈ U such that

(cid:8)U ∈ U : convex, F (U) = min F(cid:9) =(cid:8)x +U0 : − x ∈ U0

(3.24)

(cid:9)

As mentioned earlier, the argument will be based on convexity, but this time with respect to

convex combinations based on Minkowski addition of sets. For the eigenvalue, we get:
Lemma 3.10 For any bounded non-empty open convex sets U,V ⊂ R2 and any α ∈ [0,1],

λ(cid:0)αU + (1− α)V(cid:1) ≤ αλ (U) + (1− α)λ (V ).

Moreover, assuming α ∈ (0,1), equality holds only if U and V are homothetic.

(3.25)

Proof. The argument can be gleaned from the proof of Theorem 1 in Colesanti [6].
Indeed,
convexity of λ is shown in formula (45) on page 127 while strict convexity for non-homothetic U

triangle corresponds to the convex polygon U while the ellipses stand for the set V . Note that the
dashed lines are just translates of the sides of the triangle.

and V follows by assuming equality in formula (45) and then following the argument starting
(cid:3)
from the second display from the bottom on page 128.

Concerning the perimeter, we claim:

Lemma 3.11 P(·) is an afﬁne function on the class of bounded, open and convex sets. Explic-
itly, for any U,V ⊂ R2 bounded, open and convex,

P(cid:0)αU + (1− α)V(cid:1) = αP(U) + (1− α)P(V ),

(3.26)
Proof. Let U and V be bounded, open and convex sets in R2. Since αP(U) = P(αU), it sufﬁces
to prove

α ∈ [0,1].

for U +V := {u + v: u ∈ U, v ∈ V}. The setting is illustrated in Fig. 1.

P(U +V ) = P(U) + P(V )

(3.27)

Let us ﬁrst assume that U is a convex polygon. Denote by u1, . . . ,un the vertices of U listed
in the clockwise direction and let e1 := (u1,u2), . . . ,en := (un,u1) be the corresponding edges
regarded as vectors in R2. For every 1 ≤ i ≤ n, there is at least one point vi ∈ ∂V for which

(cid:8)svi +tei : s ≥ 1, t ∈ R}∩V = /0.

Now consider the set C := U +V . We claim that C is the convex hull of(cid:83)n

(3.28)
The points {vi : i = 1, . . . ,n} are not necessarily unique but the above ensures that they run
around ∂V in the clockwise direction.
i=1(ui +V ). Indeed,
every point in C can be written as u + v for some u ∈ U and v ∈ V . Since there are t1, . . . ,tn ≥ 0
satisfying ∑ti = 1 and ∑tiui = a, we have

∑
It follows that C is a subset of the convex hull of(cid:83)n

u + v =

i=1

n

ti(ui + v).

Now by the deﬁnition of vi and the convexity of U we obtain that the line connecting ui + vi
and u(i+1) mod n + vi is in ∂C. The ρ-lengths of these segments add up to exactly P(U). On the

i=1(ui +V ); the other inclusion is trivial.

(3.29)

14

BISKUP AND PROCACCIA

other hand, the complement of these segments in ∂C is the union of closed arcs connecting vi to
v(i+1) mod n on ∂V . The sum of the ρ-lengths of these arcs is P(V ). Hence P(C) = P(U) +
P(V ) thus proving (3.27) when U is a polygon.

Let now U,V be general bounded, open and convex sets. Given ε > 0, let Uε be a convex

polygon with vertices on ∂U such that

distH(U,Uε ) < ε

and P(U) ≥ P(Uε ) ≥ P(U)− ε,

(3.30)

and let Vε be the analogous object for V . Then Uε +Vε is a convex polygon whose vertices lie
on ∂ (U +V ) and so, by the deﬁnition of the perimeter and (3.27) for polygonal domains,

P(U +V ) ≥ P(Uε +Vε ) = P(Uε ) + P(Vε ) ≥ P(U) + P(V )− 2ε.

(3.31)
Taking ε ↓ 0, we get ≥ in (3.27) for U and V . To get also ≤, we use that Uε → U and Vε → V in
the Hausdorff distance. Lemma 3.8 then shows

(3.32)

P(U +V ) ≤ liminf
ε↓0

= liminf

ε↓0

P(Uε +Vε )

(cid:0)P(Uε ) + P(Vε )(cid:1) ≤ P(U) + P(V ),

where we used the claim for convex polygons to get the equality and (3.30) for both U and V to
(cid:3)
get the inequality on the extreme right. This proves (3.27) and thus the whole claim.
Remark 3.12 It is easy to come up with examples of non-convex sets in R2 for which the
statement of Lemma 3.11 fails. Similarly, the example of U := (0,1)d and V := Euclidean ball
shows that this lemma does not apply in d ≥ 3 either.

We are now ready to prove the above uniqueness claim:

Proof of Proposition 3.9. Suppose that U,V ∈ U are two convex minimizers of F . If U and V
were not homothetic, then the combination of Lemmas 3.11 and 3.10 would show
α ∈ (0,1)

F(cid:0)αU + (1− α)V(cid:1) < αF (U) + (1− α)F (V ),

(3.33)

and so at least one of U and V could not be a minimizer. Hence, U and V are homothetic
and so there is x ∈ R2 and t > 0 such that U = x + tV . The scaling relations (1.7) then imply
λ (U) = t−2λ (V ) and P(U) = tP(V ) and so F (U) = g(t) where

g(s) := F (sV ) = s−2λ (V ) + sP(V ),

s > 0.

(3.34)

Now g is strictly convex with a unique minimum on (0,∞). Since g(1) = F (V ) while g(t) =
F (U), if both U and V are to be minimizers of F then we must have t = 1. We conclude that U
(cid:3)
is a translate of V , thus proving the statement.

3.4 Ruling out non-convex minimizers.
The next task is to show that there are in fact no non-convex minimizers of U (cid:55)→ F (U). For this
purpose, as well as further use later, we will need:
Lemma 3.13 Suppose U ⊂ R2 be open and simply connected and let U(cid:48) ⊂ R2 be bounded, open
and convex with U ⊆ U(cid:48). Then U (cid:54)= U(cid:48) implies λ (U(cid:48)) < λ (U).

EIGENVALUES UNDER PERIMETER CONSTRAINT
15
Proof. Since U is simply connected, the fact that U (cid:54)= U(cid:48) implies that U(cid:48) (cid:114)U contains a closed
In d = 2, this set has a non-zero capacity in U(cid:48), i.e.,
connected set of non-zero diameter.
capU(cid:48)(U(cid:48) (cid:114) U) > 0. (Here for V ⊆ U bounded and V relatively compact in U, capU (V ) is the
minimum of (cid:107)∇ f(cid:107)2
2 over C2-functions f such that f := 1 on V and f := 0 on U c.) By known facts
about Dirichlet eigenvalues (see, e.g., Henrot [15, Section 1.3.2]), if V ⊆ U with capU (U (cid:114)V ) > 0
(cid:3)
then λ (V ) > λ (U).
We can now give:

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let ρ be a norm on R2. By Lemmas 3.4 and 3.13, every minimizer is
convex while Proposition 3.9 ensures that the convex minimizer is unique up to translations. It
follows that the set M in (1.5) for U0 as in Proposition 3.9 exhausts all minimizers of F on U .
As is easily checked, U (cid:55)→ λ (U) is preserved by rotations, reﬂections and translations of R2
while U (cid:55)→ P(U) is preserved by translations, reﬂections and exactly those rotations that pre-
serve ρ. The uniqueness of the minimizer up to translations implies that also the minimizing
(cid:3)
shape is preserved by those symmetries.

The above also permits us to prove the continuity statement in Theorem 1.3:

Proof of Theorem 1.3 (continuity of ρ (cid:55)→ U0). Let ρn be a sequence of norms converging to ρ
uniformly on the unit (Euclidean) sphere. Let Fn, resp., F denote the functional of interest for
norms ρn, resp., ρ and let U n
0 , resp., U0 denote the corresponding (unique) centered minimizers.
Reducing to a subsequence if needed, we may assume that U n
0 converge in the Hausdorff distance
to an open convex set V . Lemmas 3.7-3.8 then give
F (V ) ≤ liminf
n→∞

(3.35)
Our task is to show that V = U0. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that V (cid:54)= U0. Then the
fact that V is also centered means that F (V ) > F (U0). But Lemma 3.8 also ensures that

Fn(U n
0 ).

F (U0) = lim
n→∞

Fn(U0)

(3.36)

and so if F (U0) < F (V ), then Fn(U n
the minimality of U n
shifts then yields U n

0 ) > Fn(U0) for all n sufﬁciently large. This contradicts
0 and so F (V ) = F (U0) after all. The uniqueness of the minimizer modulo
0 → U0 in the Hausdorff distance.
(cid:3)

To ﬁnish the proof Theorem 1.3 we ﬁrst show:

Proposition 3.14 For each ε > 0 there is δ > 0 such that for all U ∈ U and with (cid:98)U denoting

the convex hull of U,

(3.37)
Proof. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the statement fails. Then there is ε > 0 and a
sequence of sets Vn ∈ U such that

distH(U,(cid:98)U) > ε ⇒ F (U) ≥ min F + δ .
distH(Vn,(cid:98)Vn) > ε

F (Vn) = min F .

but

lim
n→∞

By Lemma 3.2, all Vn lie inside a large closed ball B centered at the origin. The same lemma
also ensures that all Vn’s contain an open disc of some radius r > 0 (otherwise, as noted before,
|∂Vn| ≥ c|Vn|r−1 for some constant c > 0 depending only on ρ). Thanks to shift invariance of F ,

distH(B (cid:114)Vn,B (cid:114)(cid:98)Vn)
distH(Vn,(cid:98)Vn) ≥ ε

and so V is in fact a strict subset of W .

We claim that this leads to a contradiction.

Indeed, the sets Vn are simply connected and,
although not necessarily connected, so is V . By a theorem of ˇSver´ak [18] (transcribed in Hen-
rot [15, Theorem 2.3.19]), (3.41) then implies

Lemma 3.4 in turn shows

and so (3.40) gives

λ (V ) ≤ F (W )− P(W ) = λ (W ).

(3.46)
But V is a proper subset of W with V simply connected and W convex. Hence, by Lemma 3.13,
(cid:3)
λ (V ) > λ (W ), in contradiction with (3.46).
Proof of Theorem 1.3 (completed). In order to get (1.11), we note that for any U ∈ U ,

distH(U, M ) > ε ⇒ distH(U,(cid:98)U) > ε/2

(3.47)
If no δ > 0 in the statement of the theorem existed, we would have a sequence {Vn} ⊂ U such

that distH(Vn, M ) > ε yet F (Vn) → min F . Proposition 3.14 then shows that, for (cid:98)Vn being
the convex hull of Vn, we have dist(Vn,(cid:98)Vn) → 0 and so by (3.47) above, distH((cid:98)Vn, M ) > ε/2

must hold for all but a ﬁnite number of n. Reducing to a subsequence permits us to assume

or

distH((cid:98)U, M ) > ε/2.

that (cid:98)Vn → W in the Hausdorff distance and the same argument in the proof of Proposition 3.14

then shows F (W ) = min F and yet distH(W, M ) ≥ ε/2; in contradiction with Theorem 1.1. (cid:3)

Here we will address the appearance of various singular features on the minimizing shape. This

4.1 Facets.

We begin with the appearance of facets. The following lemma will be quite useful:
Lemma 4.1 Let e and e(cid:48) be orthogonal unit vectors and let θ± = θ±(e,e(cid:48)) be as deﬁned in

Proof. Let t,u ∈ R and let e and e(cid:48) be orthogonal unit vectors. Let θ± = θ±(e,e(cid:48)) be as deﬁned
above. We claim that

ρ(te + ue(cid:48)) ≥ tρ(e) + θ sgn(u)u.

(4.3)
(Here and henceforth, sgn(u) should be interpreted as the symbol ± depending on the sign of u;
in all expressions the sign can be arbitrary when u vanishes.) Indeed, if t > 0 we have

ρ(te + ue(cid:48))−tρ(e) = t(cid:2)ρ(e + ut−1e(cid:48))− ρ(e)(cid:3) ≥ tθ sgn(u)ut−1 = θ sgn(u)u,

(4.4)

where in the inequality we used the convexity of s (cid:55)→ ρ(e + se(cid:48)). If t ≤ 0 we in turn write

ρ(te + ue(cid:48))−tρ(e) = ρ(te + ue(cid:48)) + ρ(−te) ≥ ρ(ue(cid:48)) = |u|ρ(e(cid:48)),

(4.5)
where the middle inequality follows from the triangle inequality and the homogeneity of the
norm. To get (4.3), we observe that

due to the inequalities ρ(e(cid:48))− θ + ≥ 0 and ρ(e(cid:48)) + θ− ≥ 0, implied by (1.13).

ρ(e(cid:48)) ≥ θ sgn(u)sgn(u)

The analysis of the boundary issues will also require some well-known facts concerning the

regularity of the principal eigenfunction:
Lemma 4.2 Let U ∈ U and let γ be the curve parametrizing ∂U. Let h be the principal eigen-
function of the Laplacian in U. Then the following holds:

(1) h ∈ C∞(U)
(2) if γ is C1,α for some α > 0 in the interval (a,b) then h is C1,α on U ∪ γ((a,b)).

In addition, for U convex we have:

(3) For each 0 < r < R < ∞ there is a constant C = C(R,r) such that if U contains a disc of

radius r and is contained in a disc of radius R, then supx∈U |∇h(x)| ≤ C.

Proof (sketch). (1) The C∞-property of the eigenfunctions is a consequence of elliptic regularity
theory; see Evans [9, Section 6.3].

(2) This is a restatement of Corollary 8.36 of Gilbarg and Trudinger [11].
(3) The regularity of the eigenfunction is usually tied to smoothness of ∂U0 (see, e.g., Evans [9,
Section 6.3.2] or [11] above). Other results that work solely under convexity only address part of
the boundary (Grieser and Jerison [13, Lemma 3.2]). We will give a proof based on a regularity
estimate for the Green function.

Let GU denote the Green function in U. Then

h(x) = λ (U)

GU (x,y)h(y)dy,

x ∈ U.

(4.9)

(cid:90)

U

By Proposition 1 of Fromm [10] which is itself based on Theorems 3.3 and 3.4 of Gr¨uter and
Widman [14], there is a constant c(R) depending only on the diameter of U such that

x,y ∈ U, x (cid:54)= y,

(4.10)

(cid:12)(cid:12)∇1GU (x,y)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ c(R)
|y− x| ,
(cid:90)
(cid:12)(cid:12)h(x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ λ (U)

where ∇1 denotes the gradient in the ﬁrst coordinate. Next we derive a uniform bound h(x).
Indeed, using the Cauchy-Schwarz estimate in (4.9) and appling that (cid:107)h(cid:107)2 = 1 we get

(4.11)
Invoking the standard estimates |GU (x,y)| ≤ c(cid:48) logR and λ (U) ≤ c(cid:48)(cid:48)/r2, where c(cid:48),c(cid:48)(cid:48) ∈ (0,∞) are
numerical constants, and the boundedness of U we get

GU (x,y)2dy.

U

(cid:107)h(cid:107)∞ ≤ c (RlogR)2

r2

(4.12)
for some absolute constant c ∈ (0,∞). Taking ∇1 on both sides of (4.9) and invoking (4.10),
(cid:3)
(4.12) and the boundedness of U, we get the desired uniform boundedness of ∇h.
Another fact we will need is Hadamard’s variational formula for the principal eigenvalue λ (U).
We will follow the setting of Henrot [15]. Let v: R2 → R2 be a bounded and continuous vector
ﬁeld and for t ∈ R deﬁne Φt(x) := x +tv(x). Given a bounded open set U ⊂ R2, let Ut := Φt(U).
The set Ut is bounded for all t; we are also going to assume that Ut is open for t small. We are
interested in the dependence of λ (Ut) on t.

We will only need to examine the case when U is a convex domain. In this case, there is a well
deﬁned unit outer normal n(x) at every x (just take the vector orthogonal to the right-derivative

EIGENVALUES UNDER PERIMETER CONSTRAINT

of the boundary parametrized by Euclidean arc-length). We will also need the notation H1
∂U for
the one-dimensional Hausdorff measure on ∂U — namely, the measure that assigns a connected
segment A ⊂ ∂U its Euclidean arc-length. We then have:
Lemma 4.3 (Hadamard’s variational formula) Suppose U ∈ U is convex and let Ut be deﬁned
from a bounded continuous vector ﬁeld v: R2 → R2 as above. Then

(4.13)

where n(x) is the outer normal to ∂U at x and the integrand is bounded by our assumptions
on v(x) and Lemma 4.2(3).

Proof. See, e.g., Henrot [15, Theorem 2.5.1].

(cid:3)
These tools permit us to address the connection between the facets and degenerate directions

of the norm:
Proof of Theorem 1.5 (facets imply degeneracy). Let U0 be a minimizer of F for a given norm ρ
and let γ be the curve parametrizing ∂U0. Suppose that ∂U0 contains a linear segment in direction
of a unit vector e. The segment corresponds to the image (under γ) of interval [a,b] of t; we
assume that the parametrization is such that t (cid:55)→ γ(t) is linear for t ∈ [a,b] and γ(b)− γ(a) is the
Euclidean length of the segment.
Let e(cid:48) be a unit vector orthogonal to e which we will assume to be oriented as an outward
normal to ∂U0 along γ([a,b]). Pick a convex C1-function ψ : [a,b]→ [0,∞) with ψ(a) = 0 = ψ(b)
and deﬁne

γ(t) + sψ(t)e(cid:48),
γ(t),

if t ∈ [a,b],
else.

γs(t) :=

(4.14)
The assumptions ensure that, for s ≥ 0 small, γs parametrizes the boundary of a set Us ∈ U .
Obviously, distH(Us,U0) → 0 as s ↓ 0.
We will now examine the s-dependence of λ (Us) and P(Us) for s ≥ 0. The Hadamard formula
(4.13) with v(x) = ψ(t)e(cid:48) whenever x = γ(t) for t ∈ [a,b] gives

(cid:40)

where h is the normalized eigenfunction of the Laplacian in U. On the other hand, since ψ is
smooth, the second part of Lemma 4.1 shows

(4.16)
with θ± := θ±(e,e(cid:48)). Since the linear segment has the so called uniform ball property everywhere
in its interior, the Hopf lemma (see, e.g., the ﬁrst Lemma in Section 6.4.2 of Evans [9]) yields

and thus F (Us) < F (U0) for s > 0 small. But this is impossible due to the minimality of U0
and so we must have θ + > θ−. We conclude that, indeed, a linear segment on ∂U in direction e
(cid:3)
implies that e is degenerate for ρ.

The argument for the converse is relatively similar:

Proof of Theorem 1.5 (degeneracy implies facets). Let U0 denote a minimizer of U (cid:55)→ F (U)
for a norm ρ. Suppose that U0 does not have a facet in direction e. Then one can ﬁnd a line in
direction e that intersects the closure of U0 at exactly one (boundary) point x0. Let e(cid:48) be a unit
vector orthogonal to e oriented in the outward normal direction to ∂U0 at x0. Deﬁne

Vs :=(cid:8)x ∈ U0 : (x− x0)· e(cid:48) < −s(cid:9),

(4.19)
For s small, Vs is a non-empty convex subset of U0 with distH(Vs,U0) → 0 as s ↓ 0. Let Ts denote
the linear segment given by the intersection of the line (x − x0) · e(cid:48) = −s with U0 and let H1
Ts
denote the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure on Ts. As before, the argument will need a careful
examination of the dependence of λ (Vs) and P(Vs) on s.

s ≥ 0.

For the perimeter, (4.1) shows

where θ± := θ±(e,e(cid:48)) are as deﬁned above. On the other hand by integrating (4.13) we get

The assumption that U0 has no facet in direction e means that |Ts| → 0 as s ↓ 0. Considering the
rectangle Rs containing U0 (cid:114)Vs with one side at Ts and the other side of length s, the inequality
|U0 (cid:114)Vs| ≤ |Rs| = s|Ts| yields

(4.23)
This implies λ (Vs) ≤ λ (U0) + o(s) as s ↓ 0 and so, in light of (4.20), F (Vs) ≥ F (U0) forces
θ + = θ−, i.e., e is not a degenerate direction.

4.2 Corners.

We will now also address the appearance of corners.
Proof of Theorem 1.7 (corners imply non-convexity). Suppose U0 has a corner at x0 and let
v± := v±(x0). If γ is the parametrization of ∂U0 using the Euclidean arc-length and t0 is such that
γ(t0) = x0, then we have

γ(t) =

x0 + (t −t0)ν− + o(t −t0),
x0 + (t −t0)ν + + o(t −t0),

if t < t0,
if t > t0.

(4.24)

(cid:40)

EIGENVALUES UNDER PERIMETER CONSTRAINT

Pick a,b > 0 and s > 0 and consider the curve ξs deﬁned by

γ(t),

s(a+b) γ(t0 + bs),

ξs(t) :=

(4.25)

if − as ≤ t −t0 ≤ bs,
else.

For s small non-negative, ξs is the boundary of a convex set Vs ⊂ U0. We will again need to
quantify the s-dependence of the perimeter and eigenvalue of Vs.

Let Ts denote the part of the boundary of Vs corresponding to the ﬁrst line in (4.25). For the

eigenvalue we again get by (4.13),

λ (Vs) = λ (U0) +

(4.26)
and so, by Lemma 4.2(3), λ (Vs) ≤ λ (U0) +C|U0 (cid:114)Vs|. Since U0 has a (convex) corner at x0, we
have |U0 (cid:114)Vs| = O(s2) and so

For the perimeter, (4.24) and continuity of the norms show

ρ(av+ + bv−)− aρ(v+)− bρ(v−) + o(1)

.

(cid:17)

(4.27)

(4.28)

Taking s ↓ 0, the fact that U0 is the minimizer thus implies

ρ(av+ + bv−) ≥ aρ(v+) + bρ(v−).

(4.29)
(cid:3)
Equality then holds thanks to the triangle inequality.
Proof of Theorem 1.7 (non-convexity implies corners). Assume now that ν + and ν− are two
distinct unit vectors in R2 for which equality holds in (4.29) for all a,b ≥ 0. As can be checked,
these vectors cannot be collinear. Reversing the orientations if necessary, we may assume that ν +
is rotated counterclockwise relative to ν− by angle less than π.
Let now U0 denote a minimizing shape of F and consider tangent lines to ∂U0 in directions
ν− and ν +. These lines touch ∂U0 at points x1 and x2, respectively, and they intersect at a point x0
(see Figure 2). Now consider the domain U which is obtained by replacing the portion of ∂U0
between x1 and x2 (if run around counterclockwise) by the line segments [x1,x0] and [x0,x2].
The construction ensures that U is a bounded, open, convex set with a corner at x0 where the
tangent vectors are equal ν− and ν +, respectively. If x0 ∈ ∂U0, then U = U0 and we would be
done so let us assume that x0 (cid:54)∈ ∂U0 and derive a contradiction.
Clearly, U ⊇ U0 and since U is convex while U0 ∈ U and U (cid:54)= U0, we have λ (U) < λ (U0) by
Lemma 3.13. The triangle inequality implies that the ρ-length of the portion of ∂U between x1
and x2 is at least ρ(x2 − x1). But

x2 − x1 = x2 − x0 + (x0 − x1)

(4.30)

and so, by the equality in (4.29),

(4.31)
It follows that P(U) ≤ P(U0) and thus F (U) < F (U0), in contradiction with the minimality
(cid:3)
of U0. Hence, U0 has a corner at x0 after all.

ρ(x2 − x1) = ρ(x2 − x0) + ρ(x0 − x1).

FIG. 2. The construction of U in the second part of the proof of Theorem 1.7. The underlying set
is necessarily symmetric with respect to x (cid:55)→ −x, so if a corner can be added on one side of the set,
a symmetric corner would appear on the other side as well.

4.3 Non isoperimetric minimizers.

We end this section by analyzing the situations for which the minimizer of F is not homothetic
to the minimizer of the corresponding isoperimetric problem (1.8).
Proof of Theorem 1.2 (existence of a counterexample). Not too surprisingly, a counterexample is
provided by an asymmetric (cid:96)1-norm. Fix n ≥ 1 and, for x = (x1,x2) let

ρ(x) :=

(4.32)
Among sets of unit Lebesgue area, the perimeter is minimized by the rectangle [0,n]× [0,1/n].
n := [0,n/a]× [0,a/n]. Using separation of variables (see, e.g.,
Next pick a > 0 and let denote U a

Since AB2 ∼ π2n2(1 + a−2)2 in the limit n → ∞, taking a > 1 will result in a smaller value of
mint F (U a
n ) than a := 1, provided n is large enough. But for a = 1 the isoperimetric minimizer U 1
n
is the minimizer of U (cid:55)→ F (U), while U a
n if and only if a = a(cid:48). Hence, the
(cid:3)
isoperimetric minimizer is not homothetic to the minimizer of F once n is large enough.
Proof of Theorem 1.2 (smooth shapes). Let h denote the L2-normalized eigenfunction corre-
sponding to the principal eigenvalue of the (negative) Laplacian in U0 with Dirichlet boundary
conditions on ∂U0. The assumptions on ρ and U0 permit us to take variational derivative (see [4,

n is homothetic to U a(cid:48)

EIGENVALUES UNDER PERIMETER CONSTRAINT

(cid:12)(cid:12)∇h(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

Theorem 2.2] and [12, 16]) and ﬁnd out that we must have

(4.33)
where Cρ (x) is the curvature of ∂U0 at point x relative to arc-length deﬁned by the norm ρ
and where ∇h extends continuously to ∂U0 by Lemma 4.2(2). The corresponding variational
derivative of the Lebesgue area of U0 is a constant and so if U0 is, even just up to a scaling, also
a minimizer of the isoperimetric problem, a similar reasoning yields

= Cρ (x),

x ∈ ∂U0,

Cρ (x) = constant,

(4.34)
But this means that |∇h| is constant everywhere on ∂U0. Since U0 has C1-boundary the gradi-
ent ∇h(x) is collinear with the (everywhere-deﬁned) outer normal vector ˆn = ˆn(x). It follows
that h satisﬁes the overdetermined elliptic problem
−∆h = λ (U0)h,

x ∈ ∂U0.

h = 0,
∇h = c ˆn,

in U0,
on ∂U0,
on ∂U0,

(4.35)

for some constant c < 0. A classic result due to Serrin [17] states that (for C2-domains) this
is only possible if U0 is a Euclidean ball. By the duality characterization of the isoperimetric
(cid:3)
minimizers, ρ must be a multiple of the Euclidean norm.
