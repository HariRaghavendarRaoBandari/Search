Abstract

The thermal history and internal structure of chondritic planetesimals, assembled before the giant impact phase of chaotic growth,
potentially yield important implications for the ﬁnal composition and evolution of terrestrial planets. These parameters critically
depend on the internal balance of heating versus cooling, which is mostly determined by the presence of short-lived radionuclides
(SLRs), such as 26Al and 60Fe, as well as the heat conductivity of the material. The heating by SLRs depends on their initial
abundances, the formation time of the planetesimal and its size. It has been argued that the cooling history is determined by the
porosity of the granular material, which undergoes dramatic changes via compaction processes and tends to decrease with time. In
this study we assess the inﬂuence of these parameters on the thermo-mechanical evolution of young planetesimals with both 2D and
3D simulations. Using the code family i2elvis/i3elvis we have run numerous 2D and 3D numerical ﬁnite-diﬀerence ﬂuid dynamic
models with varying planetesimal radius, formation time and initial porosity. Our results indicate that powdery materials lowered
the threshold for melting and convection in planetesimals, depending on the amount of SLRs present. A subset of planetesimals
retained a powdery surface layer which lowered the thermal conductivity and hindered cooling. The eﬀect of initial porosity was
small, however, compared to those of planetesimal size and formation time, which dominated the thermo-mechanical evolution and
were the primary factors for the onset of melting and diﬀerentiation. We comment on the implications of this work concerning the
structure and evolution of these planetesimals, as well as their behavior as possible building blocks of terrestrial planets.

1. Introduction

During the early stages of planet formation the building ma-
terial of terrestrial planets like Earth or Mars is distributed
within planetesimals with sizes of ∼ 101–102 km (Weiden-
schilling and Cuzzi, 2006). It remains unclear how these bodies
assembled from sub-micron grains in a circumstellar disk in de-
tail. First order constraints from the standard collisional model
for growth relate the doubling time ts ∼ ρpRp/(ΣdiskΩK) of a
growing planetesimal to its size Rp and density ρp as well as to
the properties of the disk, namely mass surface density Σdisk and
Keplerian frequency ΩK (Goldreich et al., 2004). This formula,
however, essentially a cross-section calculation, ignores gravi-
tational focusing and limits to growth, such as the bouncing bar-
rier (e.g., Zsom et al., 2010) and the radial migration of solids
due to gas drag (Weidenschilling, 1977). Nonetheless, there are
also complex local processes that can enhance the formation of
planetesimals with up to several hundred kilometers radii due to
particle collection in vortices, pressure bumps, and other eﬀects
(e.g., Johansen et al., 2007; Cuzzi et al., 2008; Morbidelli et al.,
2009; Chambers, 2010; Johansen et al., 2015). These point to
rapid formation on the time scale of ∼ 105 yr after the forma-
tion of Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), consistent with ﬁndings

from geochemical data (Kleine et al., 2009).

Theoretical models to investigate this epoch after the initial
assembly of the planetesimals rely on numerical models of in-
ternal dynamics. So far, such models were mostly based on
1D studies, focusing on conductive cooling as the main heat
transfer mechanism (e.g., Ghosh and McSween, 1998; Hevey
and Sanders, 2006; Sahijpal et al., 2007). Recent work, how-
ever, has shown that more mechanisms need to be taken into
account. Firstly, these bodies are supposed to be suﬃciently big
to become heated by decay of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs),
most importantly 26Al and 60Fe, which would alter their inner
structure and evolution dramatically up to the point of silicate
melting. For example, bodies greater than ∼ 10 km in radius,
formed at the time of CAI formation, are supposed to melt com-
pletely (Hevey and Sanders, 2006). Secondly, some meteorite
parent bodies seem to have experienced solid-state deformation
(Tkalcec et al., 2013; Tkalcec and Brenker, 2014). These points
underline the importance of 2D or 3D thermo-mechanical mod-
eling approaches for the evolution of planetesimals to detect
eﬀects such as the diﬀerences of the surface-to-volume ratio
in 1D, 2D and 3D models or non-axisymmetric advection pro-
cesses. As a further complicating issue, recent work highlights
the potentially important role of porous bulk material on the
thermal history of planetesimals, by lowering the thermal con-
ductivity of the silicate material and thus to prevent eﬀective

et al., 2014).

The initial powdery state of the uncompacted material is
however reduced in the inner parts of the planetesimals by cold
isostatic compaction due to self-gravity (Henke et al., 2012),
eﬀectively decreasing its inﬂuence with increasing size of the
body. Another important aspect is the formation time of the
body. As outlined above, the accretion time scale of planetes-
imals is on the order of 105 yr, which is roughly an order of
magnitude shorter than the evolutionary time scale of the pro-
toplanetary disk and the thermo-mechanical evolution of plan-
etesimals on the order of 106 yr. Hence, the quasi-instantaneous
formation time sets the limit on the amount of SLRs incorpo-
rated into the body.

Additional heat sources for planetesimals can be energy in-
jection during the accretion of the body and later impacts. First,
the temperature increase due to the conversion of gravitational
energy to heat is low for bodies < 1000 km (Schubert et al.,
1986; Qin et al., 2008; Elkins-Tanton et al., 2011). Second, dur-
ing runaway growth, the velocity dispersion of planetesimals is
set by the equilibrium between self-stirring and gas drag. Im-
pact velocities are therefore comparable or smaller to the escape
velocity (Greenberg et al., 1978; Morbidelli et al., 2015), which
drastically limits the amount of injected energy. The formation
time thus dominates the energy budget for heating and sets the
pace of internal dynamic processes, such as core formation, to
the order of several 26Al half-lives.

Clearly, the thermo-mechanical evolution of planetesimals
needs to be treated adequatly to achieve a consistent theoreti-
cal understanding of this stage of planetary assembly. In this
study we assessed the role of the initial size, formation time
and porosity of planetesimals on their thermo-mechanical his-
tory via 2D and 3D numerical models. In Sect. 2 we describe
constraints from earlier work and outline the most important
concepts of our numerical model; in Sect. 3 we present the re-
sults obtained from the simulation runs, for which we outline
the technically inherent limitations in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we
discuss the physical implications and draw conclusions in Sect.
6. Supplementary material can be found in Appendix A and a
list of all simulations is given in Appendix B.

2. Physical and numerical methodology

The physical and numerical methods in this work follow ear-
lier work by Golabek et al. (2014), in which an in-depth anal-
ysis of observational constraints on the thermal history for the
acapulcoite-lodranite parent body is compiled. In contrast to
this study, we focused on the general role of planetesimal evolu-
tion and seeked to explore the thermo-mechnical regimes before
the onset of the giant impact phase in terrestrial planet forma-
tion. The most important physical constants used in the model
are explained in the following sections, all others are listed with
their respective references in Table 1.

2.1. Fluid ﬂow

As outlined in Sect. 1 we studied the thermo-mechanical
evolution of instantaneously and recently formed planetesimals

using the i2elvis/i3elvis code family (Gerya and Yuen, 2007).
The code solves the ﬂuid dynamic conservation equations using
the extended Boussinesq approximation, to account for ther-
mal and chemical buoyancy forces, with a conservative ﬁnite-
diﬀerences (FD) approach on a fully staggered-grid (Gerya and
Yuen, 2003), namely the continuity equation

vanced using a Lagrangian marker-in-cell technique to min-
imise numerical diﬀusion and enable an accurate advection of
non-diﬀusive ﬂow properties during material deformation. The
staggered-grid FD method permits to capture sharp variations
of stresses and thermal gradients with strongly variable viscos-
ity and thermal conductivity. For further details on the code’s
features we refer to Gerya and Yuen (2003, 2007).

2.2. Heating by short-lived radionuclides

As discussed earlier, the radiogenic heat source term Hr in
Equation 4 is dominant for early formed planetesimals.
It is
driven by the decay of short-lived isotopes 26Al and 60Fe and
the long-lived 40K, 235U, 238U and 232Th. Among these 26Al
is by far the most important one and therefore drives the inter-
nal heating of the young bodies, as the abundance of 60Fe is
lower by orders of magnitude (Barr and Canup, 2008; Tang and
Dauphas, 2012; Mishra et al., 2016). In this work, we consid-
ered time-dependent radiogenic heating by 26Al and the long-
lived radioactive isotopes as input for Hr in Equation 4. For
the initial 26Al/27Al ratio we adopted an upper-limit value (Ja-
cobsen et al., 2008) of 5.85 · 10−5 (Thrane et al., 2006) at CAI
formation.

2.3. Silicate melting model

For the silicates we assumed a peridotite composition and
used the parameterizations by Herzberg et al. (2000) and Wade
and Wood (2005) (based on data of Trønnes and Frost, 2002)
for the solidus and liquidus temperatures Tsol and Tliq, which
determine the silicate melt fraction

Above ϕ (cid:38) 0.4 a transition occurs from solid-like structures
to low-viscosity crystal suspensions (Solomatov, 2015; Costa
et al., 2009), with ηSi−liq = 10−4 − 102 Pa s (Bottinga and Weill,

tions due to this issue see Sect. 4.

2.4. Porosity

As already indicated in Sect. 1, the initial porous state of re-
cently accreted planetesimals is thought to decrease due to cold
isostatic pressing with pressure and thus depth into a conﬁgura-
tion of closer packing (Henke et al., 2012), via

2.5. Initial conditions

The spherical planetesimals in our model box were supposed
to be completely composed of silicates. Olivine outrules py-
roxene minerals in controlling deformation processes due to its
mechanical weakness (Mackwell, 1991). Thus, we apply an
olivine rheology (Ranalli, 1995) to be able to follow thermo-
mechanical processes, i.e., melting and mixing due to inter-
nal heating. Each body was built up by several rheologically
identical silicate layers, which could be followed by an inter-
nal tracking of the corresponding markers. This enabled us to
distinguish diﬀerent silicate layers and reconstruct their mixing
history. Illustrative examples are given in Sect. 3.

As indicated before, the energy release during the accretion
phase is only minor for the size of bodies we addressed here
(Schubert et al., 1986). Therefore, we started from a constant
temperature distribution all over the model grid in accordance
with values in a typical protoplanetary disk Tspace = 290 K
(Ghosh and McSween, 1998).

The surrounding of the bodies was made up of a so-called
sticky-air layer (Schmeling et al., 2008), with near zero den-
sity, constant temperature TSA = Tspace and constant viscosity
ηSA = 1019 Pa. Such a layer allows for simulation of free sur-
faces and serves as inﬁnite reservoir to absorb released heat
from the planetesimal (Golabek et al., 2011; Crameri et al.,
2012; Tkalcec et al., 2013).

The numerical model boxes had physical dimensions of 500
km in each direction in 2D and 3D, represented by 5012 grid

2.6. Parameter space

The goal of this work was to assess the combined eﬀect of ra-
diogenic heating by SLRs and initial porosity on the subsequent
evolution of planetesimals. Hence, the parameter space was
based on varying the planetesimal radius Rp = 20–200 km, the
instantaneous formation time tform = 0.1–1.75 Myr after CAI
formation and the initial porosity φinit = 0.0–0.75, in total a set
of 616 2D simulations. A full list of all applied values is given
in Table 2.

Due to the heavy computational cost of 3D simulations we
ﬁrst analyzed the 2D simulations, categorized them and then
performed selected 3D simulations to verify the 2D results.

From our varied parameters, both Rp and tform directly inﬂu-
enced the amount of SLRs present in the body. A list of all
simulation runs with corresponding parameters and categories
can be found for the 2D simulations in Table B.3 and for the 3D
simulations in Table B.4.

3. Results

3.1. Thermo-mechanical evolution

In this section we analyze the thermo-mechanical outcome
of the simulations.
In Sect. 3.1.1 we focus on the temporal
evolution of the material properties, i.e., solid or molten, and
categorize the 2D results accordingly. Each category is then
described and examples are given. In Sect. 3.1.2 we investigate
the time-dependent maximum temperatures of the bodies and
assess the inﬂuence of each of the varied parameters on it by
constructing Rp, tform and φinit isolines. Also, we analyze the
inﬂuence of φinit on the temperature proﬁle for ﬁxed formation
time and planetesimal size.

3.1.1. Material properties

Figure 1 illustrates the thermo-mechanical results of the ma-
terial properties within each 2D simulation run. Each dot rep-
resents a single simulation and color indicates in which kind of
regime we categorize the simulation. Each of these regimes is
described below and an example, illustrating the state for φ, T
and ρ at a certain time, is given. Illustrating video ﬁles for each
of the described regimes below can be found in the supplemen-
tary material (see Appendix A).

Figure 1: 3D parameter space covered by the two-dimensional simulation runs, each dot represents one simulation, with Rp in km,
φinit non-dimensional and tform in Myr. The colors indicate which thermo-mechanical state was reached during the time evolution.
Blue: all silicates were in solid form during all times (Fig. 2); green: the silicates in the planetesimal were partially or fully molten
at some stage during the temporal evolution (Fig. 3), green simulations with diamonds indicate that the numerical restrictions in our
model did not capture ﬂuid motion due to extremely low viscosities, see Sect. 4 for an in-depth discussion of this issue; orange: the
silicate layers were partially deformed, but the heating was not suﬃcient for convection (Fig. 4); red: convectional mixing occurs
during the temporal evolution of the planetesimal (Fig. 5).

Solid regime. The blue rendered simulations in Fig. 1 build the
class of solid models. These are models which lacked enough
heat production by SLRs to experience any sign of transition
from the solid silicate to a partially molten silicate state. An
example of this kind is given in Fig. 2. The upper left image
shows all simulation runs of this class. The composition plot
illustrates the unperturbed layered structure of the silicates it
is composed of. Because the body never experienced enough
heat, no transition to a molten state occurred and therefore the
layers resided with their original ordering. The temperature
and density plots illustrate these parameters at the same time
during the evolution. Since the body experienceed some heat
from SLRs it heated up and cooled down to the temperature
of the surrounding Tspace on the order of several tens of Myr.
As shown in Fig. 2 these kinds of models can be found for all
tested radii for tform (cid:38) 1.7 Myr, i.e., when the initial amount
of 26Al has signiﬁcantly reduced. Additionally, planetesimals
with Rp = 50 km already belong to this class for earlier forma-
tion times tform (cid:38) 1.6 Myr and for tform (cid:38) 1.3 Myr for bodies
with Rp = 20 km since they cooled more eﬃciently. Compari-
son of ﬁgures 1 and 2 for bodies with Rp = 20 km reveals the

inﬂuence of φinit. For tform = 1.3 Myr, the models were solid for
φinit ≤ 0.3 and molten for φinit ≥ 0.4. Hence, the eﬀects of ini-
tial porosity only aﬀected this transitional stage for the smallest
bodies in our parameter space.

Static melt regime. This class of simulations showed character-
istics of phase transitions from solid to molten states, indicated
with green circles and diamonds in Fig. 1. For the deviations
between these we refer to the discussion of our model limita-
tions in Sect. 4. An example of a static melt model is given in
Fig. 3. In the composition Fig. we see molten silicate phases
shown in red. As the material in the inner parts could not cool as
eﬃciently as the outer parts higher temperatures occurred and
thus silicates in this region tended to melt. Hence, the density in
the outer shells was higher than in the inner parts. Simulations
of this class were dominant for bodies with Rp ≤ 50 km. For
Rp = 20 km the boundary for the transition from solid to melt
was tform ≈ 1.3 Myr, for Rp = 50 km it was tform ≈ 1.6 Myr.
In bodies with Rp = 80 km this class could be found solely for
tform = 1.6 Myr, marking the boundary to the transition from
solid models to more dynamic models displaying convection.

Figure 2: Example of a solid model, i.e., without any melting
throughout the temporal evolution, with Rp = 140 km, tform =
1.7 Myr, φinit = 0.5 at t = 7.11 Myr. The all-solid (rheologically
identical) layers did not deform throughout the simulation.

Deformed melt regime. This class marked the transition from
the static melt to the mixing regime in the three-dimensional
parameter space. A deformation example is given in Fig. 4
for an evolutionary stage with molten silicate phases and de-
formed layers, which clearly deviated from the initial circular
structure. This kind of models reached higher temperatures than
their static melt-bearing counterparts. Due to the larger density
contrast this leaded to the onset of mass segregation within the
body. An interesting case is given for Rp = 50 km. These bodies
were dominated by deformation for φinit ≥ 0.4 and tform (cid:46) 1.3
Myr. This type is categorized diﬀerently as it indicates the re-
strictions of our model: if the viscosities fell below ηnum, ﬂuid
motions could not always be correctly resolved, in spite of ac-
curately modeling the heat ﬂux. Again, for a more detailed
discussion on this issue see Sect. 4.

Mixing regime. The class of mixing models was the most dy-
namic of all types. An example is given in Fig. 5, showing the
onset of convection due to extreme heating conditions within
the body due to high SLR abundances. In these cases the den-
sity contrast of inner and outer layers initiated and drove con-
vectional motion. The subsequent downwellings from the sur-
face layers (cool and dense) to the inner parts (hot and buoyant)
are reﬂected in the composition, temperature and density plots.
We will discuss the time evolution of this in Sect. 3.1.2. Models
of this kind were only found for bodies with Rp ≥ 80 km. The
formation time is less important than the radius, but showed
signiﬁcant eﬀects by lowering the threshold tform for smaller
bodies, i.e., Rp ≤ 140 km models did not mix anymore above
tform ≥ 1.6 Myr, whereas Rp ≥ 170 km models did. Even less
inﬂuential for the qualitative evolution were changes in initial
porosity, for which no signiﬁcant variance was observed.

Figure 3: Example of a static melt model, with Rp = 110 km,
tform = 1.6 Myr, φinit = 0.25 at t = 7.52 Myr. The molten layers
are diﬀerently shaded to be able to track the onset of convection
(see Fig. 4). The inner parts were hotter and less dense than the
upper layers and the temperatures were high enough to partially
melt the silicates for a limited time period.

3.1.2. Heat balance

This section is devoted to an analysis of the energy reservoir
in the bodies over time. To analyze the inﬂuence of each of the
varied simulation parameters we construct isolines, ﬁxing two
of the three parameters (see ﬁgures 6 and 7). The models which
are discussed here were among the simulations with the most
extreme diﬀerences in peak temperature and are therefore best
suited to show general trends in the data.

Inﬂuence of planetesimal radius Rp. Figure 6a shows the ra-
dius isolines for all Rp values for models with tform = 1.7 Myr
and φinit = 0.25. In general, smaller bodies cooled more eﬃ-
ciently than their larger counterparts, which were prone to reach
higher temperatures. This resulted in lower viscosities for the
latter and gave them more time to develop deformed structures
or convection.

Inﬂuence of formation time tform. Figure 6b shows the inﬂu-
ence of the formation time on models with Rp = 20 km and
φinit = 0.4. There are two interesting characteristics to note in
this plot. Firstly, the bodies with tform = 0.1/0.5 Myr showed
a steep increase in temperature, compared to all other tform iso-
lines but reached a sudden turning point at t ≈ 7.2 · 105 Myr.
These bodies incorporated more 26Al due to its half-life time
of t1/2 ≈ 7.2 · 105 Myr. When the temperatures increased, the
material transitioned to molten states and viscosities η ≤ ηnum
occurred, the soft turbulence model set in and increased the heat
ﬂux, which permitted the body to cool at an elevated rate (see
Sect. 4). Secondly, simulations with stronger heating sources
and therefore higher peak temperatures showed steeper cooling

curves than models with later formation time. In practice, the
ordering of formation isolines is reverted at t = 8 Myr. This can
be explained with the higher thermal conductivity of molten sil-
icate states. The models with higher peak temperatures reached
higher melt fractions than those with lower peak temperatures,
and are therefore able to cool down more eﬃciently.

Inﬂuence of initial porosity φinit. Figure 7 shows the contribu-
tion of initial porosity on peak temperature deviations in bodies
with Rp = 20 km and tform = 1.75 Myr.
In general, higher
porosity increases the voids within the granular material, ef-
fectively lowering the thermal conductivity. Therefore, mod-
els with higher initial porosity sustained their internal heat by
SLRs over a longer time period. Fig. 7a shows an extreme
case in the overall parameter range, where the maximum peak
temperatures deviated by ∆T ≈ 120 K, not enough to achieve
qualitative diﬀerences, as all peak temperatures were below the
melting temperature for silicates.

To check for local variations of the temperature within spe-
ciﬁc planetesimals, we derive peak temperature proﬁles by as-
sessing the maximum value from four points at the same dis-
tance from the planetesimal center. Therefore, the values in
Fig. 7b represent the maximum temperatures at a certain depth,
which does not necessarily imply the same average value for
this depth for non-axisymmetric behavior. However, irrespec-
tive of a few speciﬁc cases these are nearly undistinguishable
and certainly not in the range in which these diﬀerences aﬀect
the long-term thermo-mechanical evolution. Hence, we restrict
our discussion to the maximum temperature case. The vari-
ations in peak temperature with depth were most importantly
eﬀecting small bodies, most remarkably Rp = 20 km in our pa-
rameter space. Therefore, Fig. 7b shows the porosity isolines

for the simulation with Rp = 20 km and tform = 1.75 Myr at
time t = 4.61 Myr. Going from the surface of the planetesimal
to its center the temperature diﬀerences increased.

As displayed in both plots of Fig. 7, in such small plan-
etesimals the peak temperatures were not enough for the on-
set of melting. Thus, the temperature deviations due to poros-
ity changes did not result in qualitative diﬀerences between the
displayed models. Since the peak temperature diﬀerences be-
tween porosity isolines decrease for all other parameter com-
binations the porosity did not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the
thermo-mechanical evolution of the planetesimals.

3.2. Porous shells

Additional to the marginal eﬀect of porosity changes on the
peak temperature and the thermo-mechanical evolution, the ma-
jority of our models with initial porosity showed a porous shell
feature. As illustrated for several models in Fig. 8, these struc-
tures were retained during the thermo-mechanical evolution and
formed because of two eﬀects. Firstly, compaction due to self-
gravity by cold pressing (Equation 12) lowered the porosity
within the body close to φ = 0.42 and consequently increased
the density contrast between the outermost layers and the layers
deeper inside the body. Secondly, during the temporal evolu-
tion of the models the temperatures deep within the planetes-
imals were by far higher than those close to the surface. The
temperatures within the body were high enough for sintering
eﬀects, which altered the porosity value according to Equation
15. Because both eﬀects were unimportant closer to the surface,
a large subset of the model retained a porous layer throughout
their whole evolution. Only the models with the most extreme
heating values were hot enough to sinter or melt even their out-
ermost layers. Fig. 8 shows the combined eﬀects of planetesi-

temperatures high enough for melting processes to occur and the deviations in peak temperature were too small to inherit qualitative
changes in the thermo-mechanical behavior of the simulations (compare Fig. 1.) (b) Peak temperature proﬁles inside planetesimal

mal size and formation time on the extent of the porous shells
and the porosity change within the shell. Sintering limited the
total thickness of the shell (dnorm) and compaction determined
the increase in porosity toward the surface.

Figure 9 illustrates the distribution of bodies with and with-
out porous shells. Most notably, the dominant parameter de-
termining the preservation of a porous shell was the formation
time: for tform ≥ 1.0 Myr all models developed such structures.
Aside from the small eﬀects of lithostatic pressure, the material
distribution within the upper layers of the body did not depend
on its size, since the weight on top of it was unaﬀected by the
overall mass of the body. Therefore, these layers were only
minimally aﬀected by cold isostatic pressing. A minor eﬀect
regarding the size of the body was still observed, as models
with tform = 0.5 Myr and Rp ≤ 110 km also developed a shell,
while bodies with Rp ≥ 140 km did not.

The distribution of the porous shell structures within the
model set remained unaﬀected by initial porosity φinit and was
determined by Rp and tform. Fig. 10 shows the thickness of the
porous shell as a fraction of the size of the body Rp for diﬀer-
ent formation times tform. The values represent an average over
the results for all initial porosity values φinit, as this parameter
did not aﬀect the ﬁnal shell depths signiﬁcantly. The fraction of
the shell was larger for smaller bodies and for later formation
times. Both vary the amount of heating sources within the body,
as later formation times lowered the initial abundances of SLRs
and smaller bodies cooled more eﬃciently and displayed lower
temperatures in their interiors. Thus, sintering eﬀects were less
important.

3.3. 3D analogues

As described in Sect. 2.5 we additionally performed a set of
3D simulations for diﬀerent parameter combinations to check
for possible deviations from the 2D results. All 3D models are
listed in Table B.4.

In principal, the selected 3D simulations conﬁrmed the gen-
eral trends we have found in two dimensions before. Smaller
bodies with Rp ≤ 50 km displayed solid or static molten type
and developed no convection patterns, regardless of their for-
mation time. Larger bodies were more likely to experience con-
vectional mixing, as illustrated in Fig. 11. Comparable to the
2D simulations the formation time was the dominant parameter
for the thermo-mechanical evolution and the onset of melting
processes: early formed bodies experienced stronger heating by
SLRs. As expected from the 2D results we also found porous
shells in the appropriate parameter ranges.

The 3D models, however, did not perfectly match the results
from the 2D simulations, as can be seen for model number 624,
with Rp = 110 km, φinit = 0.25 and tform = 1.7 Myr, which
evolved to a static molten state and did not retain a porous shell.
Its 2D counterpart however was solid throughout its evolution
and we found a shell at the end of its thermo-mechanical evo-
lution. In general, as far as we can conclude from the restricted
model set of 3D simulations, they seem to have experienced
higher temperatures than their respective 2D analogues and thus
the whole parameter space was shifted toward a higher frac-
tion of static molten, deformed molten and mixing models. As
already mentioned in the introduction, this result is expected
and can be attributed to the lower surface-to-volume ratio of
3D models. Hence, planetesimals in 3D experienced a lower
heat ﬂux compared to their increased volume and abundance of

All in all, our 3D models were capable of reproducing the
most important structures, compositional types and porosity
features of the 2D models with slightly shifted regime bound-
aries and therefore veriﬁed the main conclusions we have drawn
before.

bar for Rp = 50 km, tform = 0.5 Myr shows that for dnorm (cid:46) 0.06
the porosity was φ > 0.5, increasing toward the surface.

4. Model limitations

The main caveat regarding the evolutionary channels from
Sect. 3.1 is the lower cut-oﬀ viscosity ηnum, whereas we expect
that the real viscosity at melt fractions above 0.4 drops to values
orders of magnitudes smaller than the applied lower cut-oﬀ vis-
cosity (see Sect. 2.3 for examples). This especially happened
for models with early formation times tform = 0.1/0.5 Myr, i.e.,
within the ﬁrst few half-life times of 26Al. As mentioned before
these low viscosities cannot be resolved numerically.

To estimate which of our numerical models would have ex-
perienced convection, that could not be resolved, we estimate
the onset time of convection based on the approach of Howard
(1964). Since internal heating was important in the models, we
employ the Roberts-Rayleigh number (Roberts, 1967), which
can be used to compute the boundary layer Roberts-Rayleigh
number

with Raδ ∼ 30 (Sotin and Labrosse, 1999). We use this relation
to compare the time periods ∆tη≤ηnum, during which the viscosi-
ties are expected to drop below the numerical cut-oﬀ viscosity,
with the analytical solution. Models with tcrit ≤ ∆tη≤ηnum are
marked in Fig. 1 (diamonds, static melt, unresolved convec-
tion). These, together with the deformed static class, are mod-
els for which we could not properly resolve convection. This
drawback, however, did not aﬀect the purely thermal evolu-
tion of the models, which was correctly approximated by the
soft turbulence approach (as shown in Tackley et al., 2001;
Hevey and Sanders, 2006; Golabek et al., 2011) and therefore
all other quantities were not aﬀected. Models for which the
analytic solution is consistent with pure melting and no con-
vection (tcrit > ∆tη≤ηnum, circles in Fig. 1) are additionally listed
in Tab. B.5 and are especially found for tform ≈ 1.1 − 1.5 Myr
and Rp = 20/50 km.

Additionally, there are some minor aspects, which could shift
the trends of our results, but not crucially change the general
regimes. Firstly, all planetesimals were approximated as spher-
ical bodies. Due to accretional processes in the early formation

size of the body and with earlier formation time.

phase, it is unlikely for planetesimals to be shaped perfectly
symmetric. Irregular body structures would result in higher sur-
face to volume ratios, hence enabling a faster cooling of the
body (Davison et al., 2013).

Furthermore, as already discussed in Golabek et al. (2014),
a more sophisticated approach for representing melt migration
processes, cooling eﬀects via 26Al partitioning (Sahijpal et al.,
2007) and iron-silicate-separation (Schubert et al., 1986) would
incorporate a two-phase ﬂow model, which was not featured
here. Finally we did not consider the eﬀect of melt composi-
tion on melt density, which would inﬂuence our melting-mixing
boundary (Fu and Elkins-Tanton, 2014).

5. Discussion & implications

In Sect. 3 we have presented the results from our set of 2D
and 3D computational models of the thermo-mechanical evo-
lution of recently formed planetesimals with varied radius, in-
stantaneous formation time and initial porosity to gain a better
understanding of the processes in the early stages of terrestrial
planet formation. We now discuss the key insights of our re-
sults.

Initial porosity of the bodies was only of minor importance
for the model set we have run here. Although higher initial
porosity tended to lower thermal conductivity and therefore fa-
vored higher internal temperatures, the thermo-mechanical evo-
lution was only marginally aﬀected.

As expected, radius of the body and formation time had a
strong inﬂuence on the evolution of a planetesimal. With in-
creasing radius and decreasing formation time the bodies ex-

and cannot be neglected for investigations of collisional growth.
Additionally, the thickness of the shells could be used to relate
the structure of pristine bodies in the Solar System, which did
not experience catastrophic impact events after their rapid for-
mation, to their formation time.

Many of our models reached elevated temperatures, poten-
tially high enough to outgas existing volatile elements. When
these models reached a speciﬁc boundary the resulting bodies
might end up as dry bodies, unable to deliver volatile elements
to the forming planets via impacts. Thus, future studies will
investigate the eﬀect of SLR heating and initial porosity on the
outgassing of volatiles in small bodies and therefore might have
implications for the habitability of planetary systems, when re-
lated to the delivery to accreting terrestrial planets (e.g., Elser
et al., 2012; Ciesla et al., 2015).

The more moderate models still showed temperatures high
enough for hydration and metamorphic transformation pro-
cesses, potentially creating serpentinites via an exothermic re-
action. As discussed in Abramov and Mojzsis (2011) such re-
actions can provide energy for non-volcanic hydrothermal ac-
tivity. Within certain depths of onion shell structured planetes-
imals, which are in accordance with our models and previous
work (Weiss and Elkins-Tanton, 2013, and references therein),
the energy output might be in the right regime for the synthe-
sis of primitive organic compounds, such as basic amino acids
(Cobb and Pudritz, 2014). Their synthesis is dependent on
the ammonia and water content of the corresponding planetesi-
mal and can also change with radial distance to the central star
(Cobb et al., 2015). Therefore, future studies can be directed to
couple interior evolution to exterior formation conditions, i.e.,
the region in the protoplanetary disk and the appropriate forma-
tion time for various size classes, to gain a better understanding
of the geological environment of early biological processes in
our Solar System.

6. Conclusions

The initial state of planetesimals in the early Solar System
crucially aﬀected their thermo-mechanical evolution, which
yields implications for terrestrial planet formation theories. We
have conducted numerous 2D and 3D ﬁnite-diﬀerence ﬂuid dy-
namics simulations of planetesimals with varying radius, for-
mation time and initial porosity. From these we have de-
termined the parameter space for various thermo-mechanical
regimes and the inﬂuence of initial porosity. Our conclusions
are the following.

• Typically, planetesimals with large size, early formation
time and high initial porosity tended to develop convec-
tion. Small radii, late formation times and low porosities
led to bodies which did not experience silicate melting.

• A third thermo-mechanical regime with largely molten
bodies without convectional mixing existed for an inter-
mediate parameter range with a trend toward small bodies
and formation times tform ≈ 1.1–1.5 Myr after CAI forma-
tion.

perienced more heating by SLRs, which resulted in higher peak
temperatures and steeper heating curves. Planetesimals display-
ing mixing can be expected to have experienced iron-silicate
separation. The fraction of bodies prone to signiﬁcant internal
silicate melting was consistent with previous work on the ther-
mal histories of planetesimals (Sanders and Taylor, 2005).

With decreasing radius of the body the technical assessment
of the numerical model became more important, as a thermo-
mechanical regime with partially molten, but non-convectional
interior was observed (static melt class in Fig. 1). In this regime
with ϕ (cid:46) 0.4 we expect the Stokes velocity vStokes ∼ g/η for
iron droplets to be small, such that the time scale for diﬀerenti-
ation is high. These melt-bearing but undiﬀerentiated planetes-
imals are a potentially important link for impact splash models
of chondrule formation (see, e.g., Sanders and Taylor, 2005;
Sanders and Scott, 2012; Dullemond et al., 2014). For a more
stringent analysis of the importance of these models and cor-
responding parameter ranges we will further evaluate this con-
nection in future work.

A subset of our models evolved to a state with highly porous
outer layers, which altered the cooling history of the planetesi-
mal. These shells occupied a larger fraction of the planetesimal
radius with later formation time and smaller radius of the body.
Hence, smaller and later formed objects were the most pow-
derous bodies, which can have implications on their dynamical
behavior during impact processes, as investigated by Jutzi et al.
(2008, 2009). The larger planetesimals in our dataset can ei-
ther be subject to catastrophic impact events with similar-sized
bodies or subject to impacts by smaller bodies. For both cases
the state of the material is important for the interaction with the
encountered body. All in all these eﬀects tend to inﬂuence the

• The eﬀects of initial porosity were by far outweighed by
those of planetesimal size and formation time, scarcely af-
fecting the qualitative evolution of a planetesimal.

• A majority of models retained a shell of highly porous ma-
terial in their outer layers, which was not aﬀected by melt-
ing and sintering processes inside the bodies. The depth of
these shells increased with later formation times and de-
creased planetesimal size.

With our models we were able to constrain stringent param-
eter ranges for the major thermo-mechanical regimes and to
show that porosity is not a primary factor for the evolution of
planetesimals. Future investigations will link these results to
speciﬁc aspects of terrestrial planet formation, like volatile de-
gassing and chondrule formation. Moreover, connecting these
results with SLR enrichment mechanisms in stellar clusters
(e.g., Parker et al., 2014; Parker and Dale, 2016), and thus prob-
ably strongly varying abundances of SLRs, would be beneﬁcial
for a comprehensive theory of planetary assembly and habit-
ability on interstellar or galactic scales.
