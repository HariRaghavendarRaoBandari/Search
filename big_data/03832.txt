CONSTRUCTING GENUS 3 HYPERELLIPTIC JACOBIANS WITH CM

JENNIFER S. BALAKRISHNAN, SORINA IONICA, KRISTIN LAUTER,

AND CHRISTELLE VINCENT

Abstract. Given a CM sextic ﬁeld K, we give an explicit method for ﬁnding and con-
structing all genus 3 hyperelliptic curves deﬁned over number ﬁelds whose Jacobians have
complex multiplication by the maximal order of this ﬁeld. Our algorithm works in complete
generality, for any CM sextic ﬁeld K, and for any period matrix for the Jacobian.

1. Introduction

We consider the problem of constructing genus 3 hyperelliptic curves deﬁned over number
ﬁelds with the property that their Jacobians are simple and admit complex multiplication
(CM) by the maximal order of a sextic ﬁeld. The interest in this question stems from the
situation in genera 1 and 2, where the construction of curves over a ﬁnite ﬁeld that have
CM by a given ﬁeld can be done by ﬁrst computing curves deﬁned over number ﬁelds that
have CM by the ﬁeld of interest and then reducing these curves modulo a prime ideal, under
some hypotheses that guarantee that the endomorphism ring does not become larger.

In genus 3, however, the situation is more interesting. Up to isomorphism over C, ev-
ery simple principally polarized abelian variety (ppav) of dimension 3 is the Jacobian of a
complete smooth projective curve of genus 3. Furthermore, if X is such a curve, then by
Riemann-Roch, X is isomorphic either to a hyperelliptic or a plane quartic curve. If A is a
simple ppav of dimension 3 that is isomorphic to the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve, resp.
a plane quartic curve, we will call it a hyperelliptic Jacobian, resp. a plane quartic Jacobian.
We note that the subspace of hyperelliptic Jacobians has codimension 1 in the moduli space
of ppav of dimension 3.

If we are interested only in generating hyperelliptic curves whose Jacobians have CM, then
given a sextic CM ﬁeld K, we consider the set of simple ppav having CM by the maximal
order OK and ask some natural questions: Does this set contain hyperelliptic Jacobians?
What conditions on K determine if this set contains hyperelliptic Jacobians? Do there exist
ﬁelds K such that this set contains both hyperelliptic and plane quartic Jacobians?

Our work takes steps toward answering these questions by presenting an algorithm that,
given a CM sextic ﬁeld K, ﬁrst constructs a period matrix for each isomorphism class of
simple, ppav with CM by OK, then veriﬁes computationally if the abelian variety is the
Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve. If this is the case, it computes a model for the hyperelliptic
curve. The code we have written is available on GitHub [1].

Using this algorithm, we have carried out the computations described above for all Galois
CM sextic ﬁelds K with class number 1. Some examples of the models computed can be
found in §6, along with a list of such ﬁelds K that admit a hyperelliptic Jacobian. We also
validate that the hyperelliptic curves we computed have CM. We conjecture that this list

is complete: there are exactly four hyperelliptic curves, up to isomorphism, with CM by a
Galois sextic ﬁeld of class number 1. This replicates results found in the literature [22] and
conﬁrms that our algorithm works as intended.

In forthcoming work, we plan to use this algorithm to explore the case of general K.
Currently the issues that prevent us from carrying out these computations have to do with
precision: we need to give better precision estimates for the algorithm so that we can ensure
a priori that our results are correct to a certain precision. To obtain these estimates, we
need an algorithm that takes any period matrix Z and computes a representative in the
same Sp6(Z)-equivalence class belonging to a fundamental domain suitable for convergence
of the theta series. We give more details in §6.

In the body of the paper we present some background and references for our algorithm,
as well as some results which were needed to carry out the computation.
In particular,
in Example 4.3 we present an example of a period matrix in a Γ2-equivalence class not
previously considered by Mumford [12] to make our algorithm truly applicable to any period
matrix. In §4 we also verify, using Mumford’s [12, 13] and Poor’s work [14], that the Thomae
formulae can be used to compute hyperelliptic models starting from any period matrix,
without making a speciﬁc choice for the basis for homology. Although similar computations
have been performed before [21, 22], we were not able to ﬁnd a proof of these formulae in
the literature.

This paper is organized as follows.

In §2 we present the results of Weng [22], as well
as quickly introduce the algorithm of Koike and Weng [10] to enumerate period matrices
of abelian varieties with CM by a ﬁxed ﬁeld K, with more details presented in Appendix
A. In §3, we introduce a set of maps denoted Ξg, ﬁrst deﬁned by Poor [14], and show how
to attach such a map to a hyperelliptic Jacobian. In §4, we introduce theta functions, the
Vanishing Criterion and a formula to compute the model of a hyperelliptic curve given the
period matrix of its Jacobian. In §5 we give, and provide justiﬁcation for, our algorithm
to compute the map η attached to a hyperelliptic Jacobian. Finally in §6 we present our
complete algorithm, as well as selected examples of the curves we have computed.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Previously completed computations and general observations. This work con-
siders natural questions in the geometry of genus 3 curves, some of which have been previously
considered in the literature. Most notably, in 2001, Weng [22] carried out computations iden-
tical to those presented here. She showed that if A is a simple ppav of dimension 3 having
CM by the maximal order of a sextic ﬁeld K such that Q(i) ⊂ K, then A is the Jacobian of
a hyperelliptic curve. Restricting to sextic ﬁelds K satisfying this hypothesis, she computed
models for several hyperelliptic curves of genus 3 with CM by K. In particular, she exhib-
ited 3 hyperelliptic curves with CM whose model is deﬁned over Q. Unfortunately, Weng’s
implementation is not publicly available, so we began our investigations anew.

The example of K = Q(ζ7) is classical: One can compute that there is a single isomorphism
class of simple ppav with CM by the full ring of integers of Q(ζ7). This abelian variety is a
hyperelliptic Jacobian, and a model for the hyperelliptic curve is given in [9].

It is of interest to lift the hypothesis that K contain complex roots of unity, with the aim
of determining experimentally if this is a necessary condition for K to admit a hyperelliptic
Jacobian. So far we have been unable to ﬁnd such a counterexample. We have also not yet

2

found any examples of a ﬁeld K admitting both a hyperelliptic and a plane quartic Jacobian.
These explorations will be the subject of further work.

2.2. Computing period matrices. Given a CM ﬁeld K, to compute ppav with CM by the
full ring of integers of K, we rely on the CM theory of Shimura and Taniyama [15]. In genus
3, an explicit construction was presented by Koike and Weng [10]. We use their algorithm
and present here a single result needed to complete our work, as well as the most basic facts
needed to put this result in context. For further details, we refer the reader to Lang [11] or
Birkenhake and Lange [2].

We will use the term period matrix to refer to an element Z ∈ Hg, where

(1)

Hg = {M ∈ Mg×g(C) : M T = M, Im(M) > 0}.

To such a period matrix we can associate a lattice LZ generated by the columns of the matrix
(1g, Z), where 1g is the g × g identity matrix.

This lattice gives rise to an abelian variety A whose underlying torus is isomorphic to
Cg/LZ. In this paper, we focus on the case where End(A) = OK, for OK the ring of integers
of a CM ﬁeld K of degree 2g. We will say that such an A has CM by K, and by this we will
always mean that the endomorphism ring of A is the full ring of integers OK.

To each abelian variety of dimension g deﬁned over C with CM by K is attached a g-tuple
of complex embeddings of K, no two of which are complex conjugates, called the variety’s
CM type. Conversely, when constructing such an abelian variety, we must ﬁrst choose a
CM type. An abelian variety over C with CM by the ring of integers OK ⊂ K is given by
A = Cg/Φ(a), where a is an ideal of OK and Φ is a CM type. This variety is said to be of
CM type (K, Φ).

We are interested only in constructing simple abelian varieties, a property which is com-
pletely controlled by the choice of CM type. Indeed, ﬁx (K, Φ) a CM type and let L be
the Galois closure of K over Q. Throughout, let G be the Galois group Gal(L/Q), and set
H = Gal(L/K). Deﬁne the sets

S = {σ ∈ G : σ|K = φi, for one of i = 1, . . . , g},

and H ′ = {γ ∈ G : γS = S}.

A CM type (K, Φ) is called primitive (or simple in Lang [11]) if H = H ′. It can be shown
that an abelian variety of CM type (K, Φ) is simple if and only if its CM type is primitive.
Since we are interested in constructing complex ppav that are simple, we will restrict our
attention to primitive CM types. Two CM types Φ1 and Φ2 are said to be equivalent if there
is an automorphism σ of K such that Φ1 = Φ2σ. We have the following result:

Proposition 2.1 (Streng [18, Lemmata I.5.4 and I.5.6]). Let A1 and A2 be abelian varieties
over C with CM types Φ1 and Φ2, where Φ1 and Φ2 are primitive CM types for a common
CM ﬁeld K. If A1 and A2 are isomorphic, then the two CM types are equivalent. Moreover,
if two CM types Φ1 and Φ2 are equivalent, then the set of isomorphism classes of ppav with
CM type Φ1 coincides with the set of isomorphism classes of ppav with CM type Φ2.

Since we are interested in enumerating abelian varieties with CM by a certain ﬁeld up
to isomorphism, it suﬃces to consider only one CM type from each equivalence class of
equivalent CM types.
In our case of interest, g = 3 and K is a sextic CM ﬁeld. There
are thus four possible isomorphism classes of Galois groups G of the Galois closure L of K
over Q: Z/6Z, Z/2Z × S3, (Z/2Z)3 ⋊ Z/3Z or (Z/2Z)3 ⋊ S3. (Note that Weng [22] has a
typo in the orientation of the symbol ⋊.) Weng determines primitive CM types for each

3

isomorphism class of G, and with this it is straightforward to determine the equivalence
classes of equivalent CM types:

Proposition 2.2. Let K be a CM sextic ﬁeld.

(1) If G ∼= Z/6Z, K has six primitive CM types, and they are all equivalent.
(2) If G ∼= Z/2Z × S3, K has six primitive CM types, and three equivalence classes of

equivalent primitive CM types.

(3) If G ∼= (Z/2Z)3 ⋊ Z/3Z or G ∼= (Z/2Z)3 ⋊ S3, K has eight primitive CM types, and

four equivalence classes of equivalent primitive CM types.

Proof. In any case, K has 23 = 8 CM types. For each case, the number and characterization
of primitive CM types follow from Weng’s work [22, Lemma 3.1]. In part 1, the fact that all
primitive CM types are equivalent follows again from Weng [22, Theorem 3.5]. For the other
parts, we use the fact that Aut(K) contains only the identity and complex multiplication.
Therefore, a primitive CM type is only equivalent to its complex conjugate.
(cid:3)

With these results giving us a complete list of equivalence classes of equivalent primitive
CM types for a given ﬁeld K, we can apply Koike and Weng’s [10] algorithm to enumerate
data for all isomorphism classes of simple ppav with CM by K. We brieﬂy recall this method
in Algorithm 2, presented in Appendix A, and refer the reader to [10] for full details.

3. The map η attached to a hyperelliptic period matrix

Given a hyperelliptic period matrix Z, Mumford [12] constructs a certain map η. This
map is crucial to the understanding of hyperelliptic Jacobians: First, its values control
the vanishing of certain theta functions in such a way that the hyperelliptic Jacobians can
be characterized by this vanishing property. Secondly, knowledge of a map η attached
to a period matrix allows one to recover a model for the hyperelliptic curve. These two
phenomena are explained in §4. Here we begin by describing the set of such maps η that arise
from hyperelliptic Jacobians and showing how to construct these maps given a hyperelliptic
period matrix.

Throughout this section, we will take the convention that if x ∈ C2g, then x = (x1, x2),
with xi ∈ Cg; in other words x1 will denote the vector of the ﬁrst g entries of x, and x2 will
denote the vector of the last g entries of x. For a vector x, we will write xT for the transpose,
and whenever matrix multiplication is involved, x is taken to be a column vector.

3.1. Eta maps. Throughout, we let B = {1, 2, . . . , 2g +1, ∞}. For any two subsets S1, S2 ⊂
B, we deﬁne

S1 ◦ S2 = (S1 ∪ S2) − (S1 ∩ S2),

the symmetric diﬀerence of the two sets. For S ⊂ B we also deﬁne Sc = B − S, the
complement of S in B. Then we have that the set

{S ⊂ B : #S ≡ 0

(mod 2)}/{S ∼ Sc}

is a commutative group under the operation ◦, of order 22g, with identity ∅ ∼ B. Since
S ◦ S = ∅ for all S ⊂ B, this is a group of exponent 2. Therefore this group, which we denote
GB, is isomorphic to (Z/2Z)2g.

We also need some functions on elements of (1/2)Z2g. Given ξ ∈ (1/2)Z2g, we continue to

write ξ = (ξ1, ξ2), as explained at the beginning of this section.

4

Deﬁnition 3.1. For ξ ∈ (1/2)Z2g, let e∗(ξ) = exp(4πiξT

1 ξ2).

Deﬁnition 3.2. For ξ, ζ ∈ (1/2)Z2g, let e2(ξ, ζ) = exp(4πξT Jζ), with J =(cid:16) 0 1g
−1g 0 (cid:17).

We note that these two functions are related by the following formula: For ξi ∈ (1/2)Z2g,

e∗  k
Xi=1

ξi! =Yi<j

e2(ξi, ξj)

e∗(ξi).

k

Yi=1

We are now ready to deﬁne the set of maps of interest.

Deﬁnition 3.3. Following Poor [14], we deﬁne the set Ξg to contain the maps η : P (B) →
(1/2)Z2g, where P (B) is the power set of B, satisfying the following properties:

(1) η({∞}) = 0.

(2) For all S ⊂ B, η(S) =Pi∈S η({i}).

∼= (1/2)Z2g/Z2g is a group isomorphism.

(3) η : GB
(4) For all sets S1 and S2 such that #S1, #S2 ≡ 0 (mod 2), e2(η(S1), η(S2)) = (−1)#(S1∩S2).
(5) There is Uη ⊂ B such that #Uη ≡ g + 1 (mod 4) and for all S such that #S ≡ 0

(mod 2), we have e∗(η(S)) = (−1)(g+1−#(S◦Uη))/2.

Remark. As noted in the proof of Lemma 1.4.13 of [14], the set Uη is none other than
{i ∈ B − {∞} : e∗(η({i})) = −1} ∪ {∞}.

For ease of notation, for any map η ∈ Ξg, we will henceforth denote

η1 = η({1}), . . . , η2g+1 = η({2g + 1}),

and for any set S ⊂ B, we write ηS = η(S).

Deﬁnition 3.4. Two maps η and θ in Ξg are said to be in the same class if they are equal
as maps into (1/2)Z2g/Z2g.

Because of property (2) in Deﬁnition 3.3, any map η ∈ Ξg is determined by its values

η1, . . . η2g+1. We have the following converse:

Proposition 3.5. Any ordered tuple (αi) of 2g + 1 vectors in (1/2)Z2g/Z2g gives rise to a
class of maps η ∈ Ξg via ηi ≡ αi (mod Z2g) and property (2) if it satisﬁes the following
conditions:

(1) The αi’s span (1/2)Z2g/Z2g as an F2 vector space.

i=1 αi = 0.

(2) P2g+1

(3) e2(αi, αj) = −1 for each pair i 6= j.

In fact, there is a bijection between the set of such tuples (αi) and the classes of maps in Ξg.

We note that an ordered tuple satisfying these three conditions is commonly called an
asygetic basis in the literature. We will avoid this technical term and simply speak of the
values η1, . . . η2g+1 of a given class of maps η, where η is understood to be any representative
of the class, and the entries of the values ηi have all been reduced modulo Z.

5

3.2. Associating a map η to a hyperelliptic period matrix. In this section, let X
be a smooth complete hyperelliptic curve of genus g deﬁned over C. As explained in the
literature, for example [2], a choice of period matrix Z ∈ Hg is equivalent to a choice of
symplectic basis, Ai, Bi, for the homology group H1(X, Z) of the curve. Indeed, without any
further choice, there exists a unique basis ωi of holomorphic diﬀerentials on X such that

ωi = 1

and

ωj = 0, i 6= j.

ZAi

ZAi

Then Z is the matrix given by RBi

manner.

Still without any further choices, we can obtain an Abel-Jacobi map

ωj. Conversely, any period matrix is obtained in this

AJ : Jac(X) → Cg/LZ,

s

s

Pk −

Xk=1

Qk 7→  s

ωi!i

,

which is well-deﬁned since the value of each path integral on X is well-deﬁned up to the
value of integrating the ωi’s along the basis elements Ai, Bi, and thus up to elements of LZ.
We can further choose to label the 2g+2 branch points of the hyperelliptic map π : X → P1,
P1, P2, . . . , P2g+1, P∞. Given this second choice, we can give a group isomorphism (see [13,
Corollary 2.11] for details) between the 2-torsion of the Jacobian of X and the group GB in
the following manner: To each set S ⊂ B such that #S ≡ 0 (mod 2), associate the divisor
class of the divisor

(2)

Pi − (#S)P∞.

eS =Xi∈S

In turn, this isomorphism gives rise to a class of maps η ∈ Ξg by sending S ⊂ B to the
unique vector ηS in (1/2)Z2g/Z2g such that AJ(eS) = (ηS)2 +Z(ηS)1. Since there are (2g +2)!
diﬀerent ways to label the 2g + 2 branch points of a hyperelliptic curve X of genus g, there
are several ways to assign a class in Ξg to a matrix Z ∈ Hg.

Deﬁnition 3.6. We say that the class of the map η ∈ Ξg is associated to the period matrix
Z ∈ Hg if there is a labeling of the branch points of the hyperelliptic map such that for all
S ⊂ B with #S ≡ 0 (mod 2), we have AJ(eS) = (ηS)2 + Z(ηS)1, where the Abel-Jacobi map
is deﬁned by the symplectic basis used to compute the period matrix Z.

Example 3.7 (Mumford). In [13, Chapter 5], Mumford chooses an explicit symplectic basis
for homology and computes the associated class in Ξg. He obtains the values

˜η2i−1 =(cid:18)0 . . . 0

One can show using Proposition 3.5 that this indeed gives rise to a class of maps in Ξg,
which we denote by ˜η throughout the paper.

The set U˜η associated to this map is {2, 4, . . . 2g, ∞}. He also computes

Finally, there is a transitive action of the group Sp2g(Z) on the set Ξg given by matrix
multiplication on the left on the codomain of a map η where Sp2g(Z) is the group of 2g ×
2g matrices symplectic with respect to the bilinear form A(x, y) = xT
2 y1 and with
coeﬃcients in Z. We also deﬁne

1 y2 − xT

Γ2 = {γ ∈ Sp2g(Z) : γ ≡ 12g

(mod 2)},

the principal congruence subgroup of level 2.

We have the following:

Proposition 3.8 (Igusa [8, Chapter V, Section 6]). The quotient group Sp2g(Z)/Γ2 acts
freely and transitively on the classes in Ξg.
Proof. Use the isomorphism (1/2)Z2g/Z2g ∼= F2g
∼= Sp2g(F2) is exactly the
group of symplectic matrices for the non-degenerate bilinear mapping given by e(x, y) =
(−1)xT
(cid:3)

1 y2−xT

Thanks to this action, we need only one example of a class of maps η ∈ Ξg to obtain a

representative from each class, which is given to us by Mumford’s explicit computation.

4. The Vanishing Criterion and Thomae’s formulae

4.1. Theta functions, theta characteristics, and theta constants. For ω ∈ Cg and
Z ∈ Hg, we deﬁne the following important theta series:

(3)

exp(πinT Zn + 2πinT ω).

ϑ(ω, Z) = Xn∈Zg

Recall that given a period matrix Z ∈ Hg, we denote by LZ the lattice that is generated
by the columns of the matrix (1g, Z). This gives a set of coordinates on the torus Cg/LZ in
the following way: A vector x ∈ [0, 1]2g gives the point x2 + Zx1 ∈ C/LZ, where as in the
previous section x1 denotes the ﬁrst g entries and x2 denotes the last g entries of a vector of
length 2g.

Of interest to us will be the values of ϑ(ω, Z) at points ω ∈ Cg that, under the natural
quotient map Cg → Cg/LZ, map to 2-torsion points. These points are of the form ω =
ξ2 + Zξ1 for ξ ∈ (1/2)Z2g. This motivates the following deﬁnition:

ϑ[ξ](Z) = exp(πiξT

1 Zξ1 + 2πiξT

1 ξ2)ϑ(ξ2 + Zξ1, Z).

In this context, ξ is customarily called a characteristic or theta characteristic. The value
ϑ[ξ](Z) is called a theta constant. It is the special value ϑ[ξ](0, Z) of the theta function with
characteristic ξ, which is deﬁned in [12, p. 123].

Deﬁnition 4.1. We say that a characteristic ξ ∈ (1/2)Z2g is even if e∗(ξ) = 1 and odd
if e∗(ξ) = −1. If ξ is even we call ϑ[ξ](Z) an even theta constant and if ξ is odd we call
ϑ[ξ](Z) an odd theta constant.

7

We have the following fact about the series ϑ[ξ](ω, Z) [12, Chapter II, Proposition 3.14]:

For ξ ∈ (1/2)Z2g,

ϑ[ξ](−ω, Z) = e∗(ξ)ϑ[ξ](ω, Z).

From this we conclude that all odd theta constants vanish.

Finally, we will most often only be concerned about the vanishing or non-vanishing of

certain values ϑ[ξ](Z) for ξ even. In this case, because of the transformation

we note that the vanishing depends only on the equivalence class of ξ in (1/2)Z2g/Z2g.

ϑ[ξ + n](Z) = exp(2πiξT

1 n2)ϑ[ξ](Z),

4.2. The Vanishing Criterion. We are ﬁnally in a position to state the Mumford-Poor
Vanishing Criterion:

Theorem 4.2 (Poor [14, Main Theorem 2.6.1]). Let Z ∈ Hg and η ∈ Ξg. Then the following
statements are equivalent:

• Z is the period matrix of a simple abelian variety and satisﬁes the following equations:

(4) ϑ[ηS](Z) = 0

for each S ⊂ B with #S ≡ 0

(mod 2) and #(S ◦ Uη) 6= g + 1.

• There is a hyperelliptic curve of genus g whose Jacobian has period matrix Z and η

is one of the maps associated to Z.

We note that the original idea behind the Vanishing Criterion is due to Mumford [13]. In
Chapter 3, Corollary 6.7 of loc. cit., Mumford shows that with his speciﬁc choice of sym-
plectic basis for the homology group of the hyperelliptic curve, the period matrix obtained
satisﬁes the vanishing criterion (4) above. In Theorem 9.1, he then presents a partial con-
verse and states that if there is a map η whose distinguished set Uη has g + 1 elements such
that Z satisﬁes the vanishing criterion (4) for the map η, then Z is a hyperelliptic period
matrix.

We state Poor’s result above because this Theorem 9.1 does not cover every hyperelliptic

period matrix, as shown by this example:

Example 4.3. Consider Mumford’s choice of symplectic basis and his choice of labeling for
the branch points of the hyperelliptic curve, exhibited at the beginning of [13, Chapter 5]. Act
on this basis by the symplectic matrix

(5)

¯γ =

without changing the labeling of the points. As computed by Poor [14], if γ = ( A B
C D ) ∈ Sp2g(Z)
acts on a symplectic basis with associated map ˜η, then after the change of basis, if the branch
points are not relabeled, the map associated to the new basis will be given by γ∗ ˜η, where

γ∗ =(cid:0) A −B

−C D (cid:1). In our particular case, after performing this action, the class of the new map

Lemma 5.4 that if a period matrix is associated to ¯η, then it will only be associated to maps
with #U = 8.

4.3. Takase’s modiﬁed formula. Given a hyperelliptic period matrix Z and one of its
associated maps η, we can construct a model for the hyperelliptic curve via Thomae’s for-
mulae. To state the formulae, we set up some notation. If Z is a period matrix satisfying the
Vanishing Criterion (4) for some map η ∈ Ξg, then Z is the period matrix of a hyperelliptic
Jacobian. Further, the map η comes equipped with a labeling of the branch points of the
hyperelliptic map π : X → P1, P1, . . . , P2g+1, P∞. Let x be a choice of x-coordinate such
that the hyperelliptic curve has a model of the form y2 = f (x), for f of degree 2g + 1, with
x(P∞) = ∞. Then we write ai = x(Pi) for i = 1, . . . , 2g + 1, and these are all ﬁnite values
in C.

Theorem 4.4 (Thomae [13, Chapter III, Theorem 8.1]). Let Z satisfy the Vanishing Cri-
terion for a map η ∈ Ξg. Then for all sets S ⊂ B − {∞}, #S even, and with notation as
above, there is a constant c independent of S such that

0

ϑ[ηS](Z)4 =
c · (−1)(#S∩U ) ·Q i∈S◦Uη,


j∈B−S◦Uη−{∞}

(ai − aj)−1

if #S ◦ Uη 6= g + 1,
if #S ◦ Uη = g + 1.

Proof. We note here the slight modiﬁcations to Mumford’s proof that are necessary to ensure
that the proof applies to any period matrix, and not only those considered by Mumford (see
the remarks immediately above Example 4.3 for more details).

The proof of Mumford’s Theorem 8.1 logically relies on Proposition 6.3, which we assume
here to be true about any map η, and Theorem 7.6. Theorem 7.6 in turn relies on Part 3 of
Theorem 5.3 and Corollary 7.4. The proof of part 3 of Theorem 5.3 is valid, as long as δ is
replaced with the vector ηU for a map η associated with the period matrix Z and ηk is as
in our deﬁnitions. The argument of Corollary 7.4 relies only on the Generalized Frobenius
Theta Formula (Theorem 7.1), which Mumford shows only for maps η with #Uη = g + 1,
but which is shown in full generality by Poor [14, Proposition 1.6.10]. Therefore we conclude
that the Thomae formulae are valid for any period matrix, since the Generalized Frobenius
Theta Formula is.
(cid:3)

Then we have the following:

Theorem 4.5 (Takase [19]). Let Z a period matrix and η ∈ Ξg be such that the Vanishing
Criterion (4) is satisﬁed. Then, again with notation as above, for any disjoint decomposition

9

B − {∞} = V ⊔ W ⊔ {k, l, m} with #V = #W = g − 1, we have

ak − al
ak − am

= ǫ(k, l, m)

ϑ[U ◦ (V ∪ {k, l})] · ϑ[U ◦ (W ∪ {k, l})]

ϑ[U ◦ (V ∪ {k, m})] · ϑ[U ◦ (W ∪ {k, m})]

,

with

ǫ(k, l, m) =(1

−1

if k < l, m or l, m < k
if l < k < m or m < k < l,

and where to lighten the notation we denote ϑ[ηS](Z) by ϑ[S].
Proof. The proof follows as in [19] for any period matrix Z, once we replace Mumford’s ˜η
with any η associated to our period matrix Z and U with the set Uη.
(cid:3)

Finally, to ﬁx a model for our hyperelliptic curve of genus 3, we require that x(P1) = 0

and x(P2) = 1 and compute the Rosenhain model

y2 = x(x − 1)(x − a3)(x − a4)(x − a5)(x − a6)(x − a7)

of the curve. This allows us to compute ai, i = 3, . . . , 7 directly using the formula above,
with the choice k = 1 and m = 2 for each i.

5. Computing the map η

We now show how to give a map η associated with a period matrix given only the values
of the even theta constants. We note that throughout this section, we will be concerned
with computing the class of a map η associated to Z. To apply Theorem 4.5, we then lift
each value ηi (mod Z6) to a value in (1/2)Z6 in the naive way, and then use these values to
compute ηS for the other S ⊂ B using Property 2 of Deﬁnition 3.3.

We have already remarked that with Mumford’s map ˜η and the transitive action of Sp2g(F2)
on the classes of Ξg, we can compute a representative of each class. It would suﬃce then
to verify if Z satisﬁes the Vanishing Criterion for each class of maps until we ﬁnd one that
works. Unfortunately, the size of the group Sp2g(F2) grows quickly as g grows which makes
this unmanageable. For this reason, in this section we provide a faster way to construct a
map η attached to a period matrix for the case g = 3. Throughout, we will need the group
Γ1,2, where for Q the quadratic form Q(x) = xT

1 x2,

Γ1,2 = {γ ∈ Sp2g(Z) : Q(γx) ≡ Q(x)

(mod 2)}.

We note that the quotient Γ1,2/Γ2 is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group of matrices
that preserve the 2g-ary positive deﬁnite quadratic form of Arf invariant 0 over F2.

5.1. Characterizing hyperelliptic Jacobians when g = 3. To recognize hyperelliptic
Jacobians in our situation, we use the following theorem:

Theorem 5.1 (Igusa [7, Lemmata 10 and 11]). When g = 3, the Vanishing Criterion (4)
reduces to the following: If Z is the period matrix of a simple ppav of dimension 3, then Z
is the period matrix of a hyperelliptic Jacobian if and only if ϑ[ξ](Z) vanishes for a single
equivalence class ξ ∈ (1/2)Z6/Z6 with e∗(ξ) = 1.
Proof. This is done by noticing that if Z is the period matrix of a simple ppav of dimension
3, then Σ140(Z) 6= 0, so at most one even theta constant vanishes. But in this case, Z
is hyperelliptic if and only if χ18(Z) vanishes, which implies that at least one even theta
constant vanishes.
(cid:3)

10

Deﬁnition 5.2. Let Z be the period matrix of a simple hyperelliptic Jacobian. Then we
denote by δ the unique vector in (1/2)Z6/Z6 such that ϑ[δ](Z) = 0 and e∗(δ) = 1, and call
it the vanishing even characteristic.

Proposition 5.3. Suppose that Z is the period matrix of a simple hyperelliptic Jacobian
and g = 3. Then for any η associated to Z, the vanishing even characteristic of Z is ηU .
Conversely, if Z has vanishing even characteristic δ and δ = ηU for some map η, then Z
satisﬁes the Vanishing Criterion (4) for the map η.

Proof. Let η be a map associated to Z, with distinguished set Uη. By part 5 of Deﬁnition 3.3,
we have that #(Uη ◦ Uη) = 0, so that e∗(ηU ) = (−1)4/2 = 1 and ηU is an even characteristic.
We also have that #Uη = 4 or 8 and #(Uη ◦ Uη) 6= 4 so ϑ[ηU ](Z) = 0 by the Vanishing
Criterion. Therefore ηU is the unique vanishing even theta constant.

Now for the converse, suppose that there is a map η with ηU = δ, where δ is the unique
vanishing even characteristic of Z. Then we need to show that for any S of even cardinality
such that #(S ◦ Uη) 6= g + 1 = 4, ϑ[ηS](Z) = 0.

Because #(S ◦ Uη) = #Uη + #S − 2#(S ∩ Uη), the possibilities for #(S ◦ Uη), excluding
#(S ◦ Uη) = 4, are 0, 2, 6 or 8. If #(S ◦ Uη) = 2 or 6, then e∗(ηS) = (−1)(4−#(Uη ◦S))/2 = −1
by property 5 of Deﬁnition 3.3, and so ϑ[ηS](Z) = 0 because it is an odd theta constant.

η , respectively. In
(cid:3)

In the case where #(S ◦ Uη) = 0 or 8, we must have S = Uη or S = U c

that case ηS = ηU = δ and ϑ[ηS](Z) = 0 by assumption.

5.2. Computing the maps η. There are two cases to this computation: We ﬁrst consider
the case where δ 6= 0, and then the case where δ = 0.

Lemma 5.4. Let Z be the period matrix of a simple hyperelliptic Jacobian. Then ϑ[0](Z) = 0
if and only if for every map η associated to Z, #Uη = 8.

Proof. For ξ even and any map η associated to Z, ϑ[ξ](Z) = 0 if and only if ξ = ηU . In turn,
ηS1 = ηS2 if and only if S1 = S2 or S1 = Sc
2, and η∅ = 0. This forces #Uη = 0 or 8, but since
∞ ∈ Uη, #Uη = 8.
(cid:3)

Remark. This shows that when the map ¯η from Example 4.3 is associated to a period matrix
Z, then the vanishing even characteristic of Z will be δ = 0, which forces every other map
η associated to Z to have #Uη = 8.

Proposition 5.5. Suppose that Z is irreducible and satisﬁes ϑ[δ](Z) = 0 for exactly one
even characteristic, and δ 6= 0. Then there is γ ∈ Γ1,2 such that Z satisﬁes the Vanishing
Condition for the map η = γ ˜η. Furthermore, this γ can be taken to be any such that
γ( 1

2 ) = δ (mod Z6).

2 0 1

Proof. Since Z is irreducible and has one vanishing even theta constant, Z is the period
matrix of a hyperelliptic Jacobian. Therefore there are several maps in Ξg such that Z
satisﬁes the Vanishing Condition for these maps. Choose any such and denote it η∗. Then
the cardinality of the distinguished set Uη∗ is 4 by Lemma 5.4.

Recall that η∗

i = AJ(Pi − P∞), by equation (2). Relabel the points {P1, . . . , P7} so that
if e∗(AJ(Pi − P∞)) = 1, then i ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7} and if e∗(AJ(Pi − P∞)) = −1 then i ∈ {2, 4, 6}.
This is possible because exactly three values of i ∈ {1, . . . , 7} are such that e∗(η∗
i ) = −1.
This relabelling gives rise to a diﬀerent map η which is still associated to Z.

11

We now have e∗(ηi) = e∗(˜ηi) for each i, and there is γ ∈ Sp6(F2) with γ ˜η = η (mod Z6).

We show that in fact γ ∈ Γ1,2/Γ2 by showing that for all ξ ∈ (1/2)Z6/Z6, e∗(γξ) = e∗(ξ).

For any class η ∈ Ξ3, the values ηi for i = 1, . . . 6 form a basis of the F2 vector space
(1/2)Z6/Z6. Therefore any ξ ∈ (1/2)Z6/Z6 can be written as a sum of elements in this basis,

say ξ =Pk∈S ˜ηk, and since e2(˜ηi, ˜ηj) = −1 whenever i 6= j,
On the other hand, γξ = γPk∈S ˜ηk = Pk∈S γ ˜ηk and applying the same argument to the

e∗(ξ) = (−1)(#S

2 )Yk∈S

map η, we have

e∗(˜ηk).

e∗(γξ) = (−1)(#S

e∗(γ ˜ηk).

But e∗(γ ˜ηk) = e∗(ηk) = e∗(˜ηk) by assumption and so e∗(γξ) = e∗(ξ) and γ ∈ Γ1,2.

We also have

ηU = Xi∈Uη

which completes the proof.

ηi = Xi∈U ˜η

γ ˜ηi = γXi∈U ˜η

˜ηi = γ( 1

Proposition 5.6. Suppose that Z is irreducible and satisﬁes ϑ[0](Z) = 0. Then Z satisﬁes
the Vanishing Criterion for ¯η deﬁned in Example 4.3.

Proof. By Proposition 5.3, it suﬃces to show that for the map ¯η, ¯ηU = 0. This follows since

The software implements the diﬀerent steps in Algorithm 1 as follows:

• Algorithm 2 is implemented in Sage [17] and all computations are done symbolically.

The running time of this step is negligible.

• The computation of theta constants is performed by a PARI/GP program. This is
the most time-consuming part of the algorithm. Indeed, in order to compute a theta
constant, we approximate θ[ξ](Z) by

Sξ,B = Xn∈[−B,B]3

with B > 0. To ensure that our computation is correct for N bits of precision, we
would need to estimate the error bound as a function of B and N. In genera 1 and
2, this was previously done by computing with period matrices in the fundamental
domain (see [6, 5]). In genus 3, no method for computing matrices in the fundamental
domain is known. To make sure we computed correctly with precision t, we computed
Sξ,B for several values of B until we obtained |Sξ,B ′ − Sξ,B| < 2−t for two consecutive
values B′ > B.

• Recognition of the modular function values – the Rosenhain coeﬃcients ai – as al-
gebraic integers is done using the algebraic dependence testing algorithm [3], im-
plemented in PARI/GP by the function algdep. We obtain a conjectured minimal
polynomial λi for each coeﬃcient ai. Note that the amount of precision needed for
this computation to end successfully depends on the dimension of the lattice fed to
algdep, i.e. on the degree of the minimal polynomial of the Rosenhain coeﬃcients.
This degree depends on the class number of K (see [4] for details). In practice, since
we only computed with sextic ﬁelds of class number one, 53 bits of precision suf-
ﬁced, and the degrees of the polynomials were at most 12. However, we expect the
amount of precision needed for this computation to increase dramatically once the
class number of K is increased.

• In order to validate the polynomials λi, we compute a Weil number over a prime p
which splits completely in K and construct a curve deﬁned over Fp whose Jacobian
has CM by OK. The Rosenhain coeﬃcients of this curve are roots of the polynomials
we obtained (modulo p). We check that the Jacobian of this curve has cardinality
equal to NK/Q(1 − π), for π a prime above p.

6.1. Galois CM sextic ﬁelds with class number 1 giving hyperelliptic curves. There
are 17 sextic CM ﬁelds K with class number 1 that are Galois over Q. Of these, four admit
a hyperelliptic Jacobian. They are as follows:

(1) K = Q(ζ7)
(2) K = Q[X]/(X 6 + 5X 4 + 6X 2 + 1)
(3) K = Q[X]/(X 6 + 6X 4 + 9X 2 + 1)
(4) K = Q[X]/(X 6 + 13X 4 + 50X 2 + 49)

For each of these ﬁelds, we compute that there is a single isomorphism class of ppav with
CM by K. All of these examples were found by Weng [22] or, in the case of Q(ζ7), have long
been known. We conjecture that these four examples are all of the hyperelliptic curves with
CM by a Galois sextic ﬁeld having class number one.

13

Example 6.1. Let K be ﬁeld number (2) above. The tuple (λ3(x), λ4(x), λ5(x), λ6(x), λ7(x))
of minimal polynomials for the Rosenhain coeﬃcients is:

(x3 + 22x2 − 16x − 8, x3 − 4x2 + 3x + 1, −8x3 + 8x2 + 2x − 1,
x3 − 9x2 − x + 1, x3 + 2x2 − x − 1).

For this ﬁeld, Weng computed the minimal polynomials of the Shioda invariants (the class
polynomials) (h1(x), h2(x), h3(x), h4(x), h5(x)). These polynomials have degree one, but their
coeﬃcients are larger than those of the minimal polynomials of the Rosenhain invariants:

(1048576x − 2187, 131072x − 24373629, 16384x + 11632436487,

16384000000000x + 2952169653573, 2048000000000000x − 1168038669244419).

This serves as evidence that the minimal polynomials of the Rosenhain invariants have
smaller coeﬃcients, but higher degree than those of the Shioda invariants. This is similar to
the genus 2 case, where the Rosenhain invariants were compared to the Igusa invariants [4].

Example 6.2. Let K = Q(ζ7). We obtain the tuple of Rosenhain minimal polynomials

(x6 − 5x5 + 11x4 − 13x3 + 9x2 − 3x + 1, x6 − 2x5 + 4x4 − 8x3 + 9x2 − 4x + 1,
x6 − x5 + x4 − x3 + x2 − x + 1, x6 − 3x5 + 9x4 − 13x3 + 11x2 − 5x + 1,
x6 − 4x5 + 9x4 − 8x3 + 4x2 − 2x + 1).

Finally, our algorithm works for any Gal(L/Q), where L is the Galois closure of K:

Example 6.3. Let K = Q[X]/(X 6 + 9X 4 + 18X 2 + 1). Then Gal(L/Q) ∼= Z/2Z × S3. We
obtain the following tuple of minimal polynomials for the Rosenhain coeﬃcients:

(x3−69x2 + 198x − 49, 8x3 − 448x2 − 2042x + 2401, x3 − 43x2 − 606x − 441,

x3 − 169x2 + 6479x + 2401, x3 − 58x2 − 96x + 72).

Appendix A. An algorithm for computing period matrices

of abelian varieties with CM

It is well-known that all abelian varieties with CM by a given ﬁeld K have complex points
given by Cg/Φ(a), for a a fractional ideal of K and Φ a CM type. To identify which ones
are principally polarizable, we must verify if the lattice Φ(a) admits a principal polarization.
Spallek [16], based on the work of Shimura and Taniyama, shows that this is the case if and
only if there is ξ ∈ K such that −ξ2 is totally positive in K0, the totally real subﬁeld of K
of degree g, Im(φi(ξ)) > 0 for i = 1, . . . , g, and the ideal (DK/Qa¯a)−1, for DK/Q the diﬀerent
of K, is principal and generated by ξ.

14

Let UK denote the group of units of K, let U + be the subgroup of totally positive units of
the group of units of the totally real subﬁeld K0, and let be U1 the subgroup of U + containing
only units of the form ǫ¯ǫ for ǫ ∈ O×
K. Then to ﬁnd a suitable ξ given an ideal a such that
(DK/Qa¯a)−1 is principal and a generator b of this principal ideal, it is enough to multiply b
by a set of coset representatives of UK/U +. If we can ﬁnd one such suitable ξ, all diﬀerent
possibilities – each giving a diﬀerent principal polarization – diﬀer from this ﬁrst element by
an element of the quotient U +/U1, by a theorem of van Wamelen [20, Theorem 5]. In their
paper, Koike and Weng [10] give a procedure to compute representatives for the quotient
groups UK/U + and U +/U1, which we also use.
