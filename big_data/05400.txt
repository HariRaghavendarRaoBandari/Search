ABSTRACT

Context. The subsequent coalescence of low–mass halos over cosmic time is thought to be the major formation channel of massive
spiral galaxies like the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). The gaseous halo of a massive galaxy is considered to be the
reservoir of baryonic matter persistently fueling the star formation in the disk. Because of its proximity, M31 is the ideal object for
studying the structure of the halo gas in great detail.
Aims. Using the latest neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) data of the Eﬀelsberg-Bonn HI Survey (EBHIS) allows comprising a compre-
hensive inventory of gas associated with M31. The primary aim is to diﬀerentiate between physical structures belonging to the Milky
Way Galaxy and M31 and accordingly to test the presence of a M31 neutral gaseous halo.
Methods. Analyzing the spatially fully sampled EBHIS data makes it feasible to trace coherent HI structures in space and radial
velocity. To disentangle Milky Way and M31 HI emission we use a new approach, along with the traditional path of setting an upper
radial velocity limit, by calculating a diﬀerence second moment map.
Results. We argue that M31’s disk is physically connected to an asymmetric HI halo of tens of kpc size, the M31 cloud. We conﬁrm
the presence of a coherent low–velocity HI ﬁlament located in between M31 and M33 aligned at the sky with the clouds at systemic
velocity. The physical parameters of the HI ﬁlament are comparable to those of the HI clouds at systemic velocity. We also detected
an irregularly shaped HI cloud that is is positionally located close to but oﬀset from the stellar body of And XIX.

1. Introduction

The Local Group (LG) of galaxies is a unique laboratory for
testing and investigating the formation and evolution of stel-
lar and gaseous bodies. Already today, HI data of LG ob-
jects oﬀer a suﬃciently high-mass sensitivity to detect gaseous
low mass halos of about MHI ∼ 104 M⊙ (Thilker et al. 2004;
Westmeier et al. 2008), which are orders of magnitude below
those of the “building blocks” of massive baryonic halos, the
dwarf galaxies (Blitz et al. 1999; Klypin et al. 1999). Accord-
ing to standard ΛCDM cosmology, we expect to detect massive
concentrations of baryons (large spiral galaxies) in the current
epoch. They are closely correlated spatially with a high number
of these low mass halos (Klypin et al. 1999).

Because of the complex spatial and kinematical mixture of
the individual gas clouds in the Milky Way galaxy and its halo,
these building blocks are diﬃcult to identify. Considering the
strong environmental dependence of the chemical composition,
as well as the heating and cooling of the diﬀerent gaseous phases
(Wolﬁre et al. 2003), the quantitative modeling demands a very
careful approach (Kalberla & Kerp 2009). Consequently, dif-
fusely distributed low column density HI structures located in
the Milky Way halo and in the disk-halo interface are diﬃcult to
separate from the luminous and highly dynamic disk gas emis-
sion if not separated well in Doppler velocity.

Because of their proximity and partly signiﬁcant separation
in radial velocity from the Milky Way HI emission, the An-
dromeda (Messier 31, M31) and Triangulum (Messier 33, M33)
galaxies allow investigation of diﬀuse low mass gaseous halo

structures. Here, we study the 21-cm line emission of neutral
atomic hydrogen (HI) observed within the course of the Ef-
felsberg Bonn HI Survey (Winkel et al. 2016; Kerp et al. 2011;
Winkel et al. 2010, EBHIS).

Blitz et al. (1999) performed a comprehensive observational
inventory of the LG galaxies and the high–velocity clouds
(HVCs). HVCs are proposed to populate the circumgalactic en-
vironment of the massive galaxies (Westmeier et al. 2008). Their
radial velocities deviate from the systemic velocities of these
galaxies up to a few hundred km s−1. In the case of M31, all
investigations are faced with confusion at lower radial velocities
than the systemic ones (see Lehner et al. 2015, Fig. 2) between
M31 and Milky Way HI. Distinguishing between M 31 and the
unrelated Milky Way foreground, HI emission, in particular with
HVC emission (Simon et al. 2006), is a major issue that we con-
sider here.

To minimize systematic biases due to this Milky Way
gas confusion, previous HI studies of M31 and its environ-
ment either focused on structures at M31’s systemic veloci-
ties (Braun & Thilker 2004; Wolfe et al. 2013) around vLSR =
−300 km s−1 or instead used upper radial velocity thresholds
(Thilker et al. 2004; Westmeier et al. 2005) ranging between
−160 km s−1 ≤ vLSR ≤ −140 km s−1. For the northern portion
of the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn survey data (Kalberla et al. 2005,
LAB),
the Leiden–Dwingeloo survey (Hartmann & Burton
1997, LDS), Blitz et al. (1999) extended the analyzed radial
velocity range up to vLSR ≤ −85 km s−1 and identiﬁed the
“M31 cloud” apparently connected in HI emission to M31’s disk.

Not only their ﬁnding but also the studies of M31’s dwarf
satellite system (Collins et al. 2013) motivate us to inspect this
radial velocity regime more closely. For example, the dwarf
spheroidal satellite galaxies And X (Kalirai et al. 2010), XXIV,
XXV, and XIX (Collins et al. 2013) populate the radial veloc-
ity range −164 km s−1 ≤ vLSR ≤ −107 km s−1, which has
so far only been marginally explored by HI observations. The
lack of spatial correlation between sensitive HI observations
(Thilker et al. 2004; Braun et al. 2009) and the Pan-Andromeda
Archeological Survey (PAndAS, McConnachie et al. (2009)) op-
tical data “on all scales” (Lewis et al. 2013) might be considered
as a result of the applied HI radial velocity limits.

We start our analysis by exploring the EBHIS data follow-
ing the classical path of setting an upper radial velocity limit
of vLSR = −95 km s−1. Furthermore, we invent a new approach
by calculating a so–called “diﬀerence second moment map” to
disentangle coherent HI structures in the space and the veloc-
ity domain. Essential for our investigation is the suﬃciently
high spatial resolution that is oﬀered by EBHIS (Kerp et al.
2011; Winkel et al. 2016). Using the diﬀerence second moment
map approach, we analyze M 31’s HI emission up to vLSR =
−25 km s−1.

The paper is organized in six sections. Section 2 describes
the EBHIS data brieﬂy. Section 3 compiles our results of a mor-
phological investigation and discusses the detection limits. It
also comprises a comparison of the EBHIS data with previous
single-dish HI observations of M31. Section 4 presents our new
approach of calculating diﬀerence second moment maps to dis-
tinguish between M 31 and unrelated Milky Way HI emission.
Section 5 contains a discussion of the physical association of the
reported gaseous structures with the Andromeda galaxy and its
dwarf galaxy system. Here, the impact of the tidal interaction,
galaxy impact, and proper motion of M31 as an entity against
a hypothetical LG medium is discussed. Section 6 presents our
summary and conclusions.

2. Data

We use EBHIS 21-cm line data from the ﬁrst coverage
(Kerp et al. 2011; Winkel et al. 2016, 2010). EBHIS covers the
whole northern sky above a declination of −5◦ with a radial
velocity range −1000 ≤ vLSR[km s−1] ≤ 19000. The EBHIS
data of M31 have been extracted and processed by the stan-
dard data reduction pipeline (Winkel et al. 2010, 2016). The me-
dian root-mean-square (rms) uncertainties of the antenna bright-
ness temperature is 90 mK for a spectral channel separation of
∆vLSR = 1.29 km s−1. To increase the signal–to–noise ratio for
our M31 analysis, we binned spectral channels by a factor of ten.
The contamination by random noise was minimized in the map
presentation by generating a mask with a 5σ threshold, equiv-
alent to 142 mK across the whole ﬁeld of interest. The EBHIS
angular resolution of 10.8 arcmin (2.36 kpc at the M31 distance
of 752 kpc (Riess et al. 2012)) is unaﬀected by this ﬁltering pro-
cess.

3. Results and comparison with previous studies

Figure 1 (left panel) displays a column density map. M 31 is
located close to the center of the map. The HI emission from
the Milky Way plane is visible along the top, while M 33 is lo-
cated in the lower left corner. The extent of the map is about
30◦, corresponding to ∼ 400 kpc at the M31 distance of 752 kpc
(Riess et al. 2012). The right panel of Figure 1 shows the corre-
sponding radial velocity map of the area of interest (see Sect.4,

Article number, page 2 of 10

Eq. 2). Coded in colors are the intensity-weighted Doppler ve-
locities of the gaseous structures. These ﬁrst moment maps al-
low us to distinguish kinematically between individual coherent
HI structures.

To illustrate this in more detail, we investigated the superpo-
sition of the HI gas emission toward the northern portion of M31,
in particular with HVC complex H (Simon et al. 2006). Figure 2
displays the column density weighted velocity structure toward
this particular area of interest. The HI gas appears to be subdi-
vided in individual HI structures ranging in angular size between
a few tens of arcmin to several degrees. All these individual HI
objects are showing up as coherent HI structures in radial veloc-
ity. Figure 2 displays a continuous connection in column density
and radial velocity between the M31 disk and the large extended
HI structure labeled with (a) in Fig.1.

In the following we focus on those diﬀuse HI emission
structures that are prominent at Doppler velocities of vLSR ≃
−115 km s−1 (labeled in Fig. 1, left panel with (a) and (b)). They
appear to emerge from M31’s HI disk. We also identiﬁed at these
low radial velocities HI components positionally located close to
the M31/M33 HI bridge at systemic velocities (Braun & Thilker
2004; Wolfe et al. 2013).

3.1. Leiden–DwingelooSurvey:“M31cloud”

A comparison of our EBHIS with low–angular resolution LDS
data by Blitz et al. (1999, see Fig. 5) shows very good agree-
ment. Blitz et al. (1999) labeled the whole HI structure position-
ally oﬀset from M 31’s disk with a total extent of about 14 de-
grees as the “M31 cloud”. They discuss the striking morphology
and positional agreement of the M31 cloud with M31 but felt un-
able to derive clear evidence of any association of the M31 cloud
with M31.

3.2. GreenBankandEffelsbergTelescopes:M31-HVCs

In a dedicated sensitive HI survey with the Green-Bank Tele-
scope (GBT), Thilker et al. (2004) mapped a 7◦ × 7◦ region cen-
tered on the stellar body of M31. Their Fig. 2 displays the HI
column density distribution, which they attribute to the M31-
HVC gas. Thilker et al. (2004) calculated a spatial mask for
the brightness temperature using a velocity threshold of vLSR ≤
−170 km s−1 to distinguish between M31 HI disk and unrelated
Milky Way emission. As the consequence of the applied method,
the M31 halo gas appears to be disconnected from M 31’s HI
disk. Because our Fig. 1 displays the full observed HI emission
up to vLSR = −95 km s−1, we obtain a markedly diﬀerent pre-
sentation. In our maps, it is possible to identify smooth, continu-
ously connected HI ﬁlaments emerging from M31’s disk instead
of isolated HVCs as described by Thilker et al. (2004).

3.3. DistributionofM31–HVCs

Figure 2 of Thilker et al. (2004) shows M 31-HVCs with com-
parable HI column densities above and below the M 31’s disk.
The HI distribution above and below M31’s stellar disk in our
EBHIS maps (Fig. 1) but also in the LDS map investigated by
Blitz et al. (1999) appears to be very diﬀerent from these GBT
results. Both display smooth and coherent HI structures rather
than individual ﬁlaments. Next, we investigate whether the dif-
ferent selection criteria or sensitivity limitations of the all-sky
survey data map cause this apparent asymmetry. For this aim we
study the southeastern disk side in more detail.

sensitivity threshold across the radial velocity range −600 km s−1 ≤ vLSR ≤ −95 km s−1 is displayed. The plane of the Milky Way galaxy is
visible along the top, and M33 is seen in the lower left corner. At the distance of M31, the extent of the map corresponds to 400 kpc. Right
panel: the intensity weighted Doppler velocity map of the area of interest. Using the radial velocity information, it is feasible to distinguish
between individual coherent HI structures. The rotation of both local group spiral galaxies, as well as HI emission of so-called high-velocity
clouds complex H (Simon et al. 2006; Blitz et al. 1999) (vLSR ≃ −200 km s−1) next to the Milky Way galaxy emission, can be identiﬁed.

Fig. 2. First moment map toward the northern portion of the M31 HI gas distribution. Displayed are radial velocities in the range −588 ≤
vLSR [km s−1] ≤ −110. Here, the confusion of M31 HI gas with that of HVC complex H is most severe. This ﬁrst moment map allows HI gas
superimposed on a single line of sight but moving at diﬀerent radial velocities to be disentangled.

The Eﬀelsberg maps presented by Westmeier et al. (2008)
show M31-HVCs located below the southeastern portion of
M31’s disk. In Fig. 1 this portion of the M31 disk appears to be
featureless. According to Westmeier et al. (2008), M31-HVCs
HI column densities are found to be about NHI = 1 · 1019 cm−2.
Figure 3 displays the EBHIS HI column density map of M31’s
gas distribution integrated across the relevant radial velocity
range −530 ≤ vLSR [km s−1] ≤ −480. The M31-HVCs 1, 2,
and 5, according to the naming convention of Westmeier et al.
(2008), are signiﬁcantly detected by EBHIS. The EBHIS col-
umn densities are about 25% lower than those reported by
Westmeier et al. (2008). We attribute this diﬀerence to residual
baseline uncertainties of the EBHIS data. However, the detection
of these faint M31-HVCs in the shallow EBHIS data demon-
strates the high quality of the EBHIS data processing pipeline
(Winkel et al. 2016, 2010; Martin et al. 2015).

The diﬀerent appearance between the northern and southern
portions of M31 HI disk in the EBHIS data is signiﬁcant. It is
not the result of artifacts of the data processing. The EBHIS data
is consistent with an extended and lopsided HI structure located

toward the northwestern portion of the M31 disk identiﬁed ﬁrst
by Blitz et al. (1999).

3.4. TestingtheassociationbetweenM31andtheM31cloud

Figure 4 displays the EBHIS brightness temperature distribu-
tion of four subsequent velocity channels. The top left panel
shows the most negative velocity channel. Faint HI emission
above the 5-σ level is apparent, positionally consistent with the
northern structure (a) in Fig. 1. The next channel presented in
the top righthand panel reveals a much more extended HI emis-
sion patch. The bottom lefthand panel shows very extended HI
emission in the northwestern halo portion of M31’s disk and the
HI peaks of the ﬁlamentary structure in between M31 and M33.
The bottom righthand panel displays a continuous connection
between M31’s disk and these halo structures. This channel-by-
channel “evolution” from a patchy to a coherent HI structure in
the EBHIS data cube is suggestive of an association between
M31 and the M31 cloud. The brightest portions of these coher-
ent HI structures are positionally coincident with the HI ﬁla-
ments observed with the GBT (Thilker et al. 2004). Thilker et al.

M31-HVCs 1,2 and 5 discovered by Westmeier et al. (2008) in that radial velocity range are also detected by EBHIS, however the EBHIS column
densities are lower by about 25%. These HVCs are below the applied 5 − σ threshold applied to the other maps. To demonstrate the baseline
quality of the EBHIS standard data reduction the lower brightness temperature cut has been set to −0.5 K km s−1.

(2004) attributed these ﬁlaments to individual isolated M31-
HVCs.

4. Separation of coherent HI Doppler velocity

structures by second moment maps

Radio spectroscopic data allow to diﬀerentiate not only spatially
between diﬀerent sources of HI emission but also in radial veloc-
ity. In the following we show that the calculation of the so-called
“diﬀerence second moment map” allows one to diﬀerentiate in-
dividual HI gas features superimposed on a single line of sight.

In the case of an isolated HI cloud, these maps are used to
trace only the information on the physical conditions within this
cloud of interest and to give immediate physical meaning. Equa-
tion 1 gives the integral across the HI cloud and is a measure
for its column density and eventually for its HI mass. Equation 2
comprises the information on the bulk motion of the cloud as an

Article number, page 4 of 10

entity. Equation 3 provides a measure for the velocity dispersion
σ of the cloud. In particular, (vi − M1)2 is a measure of the veloc-
ity deviation along a particular line of sight relative to the aver-
age intensity-weighted velocity ﬁeld M1. In Eq.3, Ii weights the
velocity irregularities proportional to their HI brightness temper-
atures. The weighting of (vi − M1)2 with Ii is a key to disentan-
gleing accidentally confused coherent HI structures. HI objects
showing up with deviating radial velocities (vi − M1)2 from the
2 · Ii) become distinguishable in the
dominant averaged gas (∝ M1
M2 map as discontinuities.

As an example, in case unrelated radial velocity structures
are accidentally superimposed on a single line of sight, the sec-
ond moment map will show up a M2 discontinuity in comparison
to the neighboring unconfused regions. The whole overlapping
area will show up with an excess M2 value that outlines the shape
of the overlapping zone. The M2 value of two crossing HI ﬁla-
ments, each with a FWHM of 10 km s−1 and both with the same
brightness temperature TB, yields M2 = TB · 2 × 4.2 km s−1 at the
position of the cross–over point. Spatially oﬀset from that cross-
ing zone, each individual ﬁlament will show up with only half
that M2 value. Thus, the second moment maps mark the location
of the cross–over point of the two HI ﬁlaments by doubling the
second moment value M2. In case that both HI ﬁlaments move
with diﬀerent radial velocities, the M2 value increases propor-
tionally. The discontinuity becomes even more obvious. But also
in the case of a mediocre diﬀerence in radial velocities, the M2
value is a sensitive tool for diﬀerentiating between both ﬁlaments
spatially (see Fig. 5).

Because of the weighting of (vi − M1)2 with the brightness
temperature Ii (see Eq. 3), the column density contrast between
the superimposed gas ﬁlaments is also important. Figure 5 dis-
plays the interrelation between column density contrast and dif-
ference in radial velocity of the superposed HI structures. In the
case of equal column densities (1:1, meaning ﬁlament one and
ﬁlament two have the same column density), the value of M2 in-

emission exceeding the applied 5-σ threshold of the EBHIS data. The insets in the top right corner of each panel gives the Doppler velocity
relative to the local standard of rest. For display purposes, the brightness temperature is clipped above TB = 2.5 K.

creases rapidly proportional to the radial velocity diﬀerence of
both ﬁlaments. Thus, the cross-over point can be easily identi-
ﬁed as a discontinuity in the M2 map even in the case of a small
separation of both ﬁlaments in radial velocity (in this particu-
lar example ∆vrad ≥ 10 km s−1). In case of a 1 : 10 or even
1 : 100 column density ratio diﬀerentiating between the indi-
vidual HI ﬁlaments demands a much larger separation in radial
velocities between both superposed ﬁlaments. This implies that
toward high galactic latitudes, with their moderate column den-
sities with NHI ∼ 1020 cm−2, the second moment map approach
can be applied straightforwardly to identify superposed but un-
related HI emission down to NHI ∼ 1019 cm−2.

4.1. TheMilkyWaygalaxycolumndensitydistributiontoward

M31

According to the considerations above, we have to study the HI
column density level of the Milky Way galaxy towards M31 and
its velocity structure. The maximum of the HI column density
level toward the area of interest is NHI = 3.6 · 1020 cm−2 within
|vLSR| ≤ 600 km s−1. Eighty percent of this column density is as-
sociated with Milky Way HI gas observed within the low veloc-
ity range |vLSR| ≤ 25 km s−1. Ninety-seven percent of that diﬀuse
NHI is included by integrating across the intermediate velocity
range |vLSR| ≤ 50 km s−1. Finally 99% of the total column den-
sity across the whole ﬁeld of interest is contained in the more
extended intermediate-velocity range |vLSR| ≤ 75 km s−1. Thus,

Fig. 5. Displayed are the second moments as a function of the radial velocity diﬀerence of two gas columns with the same velocity dispersion but
diﬀerent NHI. 1 : 1 denotes the situation of a NHI ratio of unity, 1 : 10 and 1 : 100 even higher column density ratios. The higher the contrast of
both superimposed column densities, the larger the necessary separation in radial velocity for a signiﬁcant separation of both clouds in M2.

the dominant fraction of Milky Way HI gas in the area toward
M 31 is associated with gas at low and intermediate velocities.
To explore the superposition of the diﬀerent HI structures sig-
niﬁcantly in the M2 map, we exclude the low-velocity regime
|vLSR| ≤ 25 km s−1 from further analysis. This choice reduces the
column density contrast between the Milky Way and unrelated
gas by about 80%.

Figure 6 displays the zeroth moment (left panels) and the
second moment maps (right panels). The moment zero map
(−588 ≤ vLSR[km s−1] ≤ −25, Fig. 6 top left hand panel) shows
M31 but is dominated by Milky Way gas. A Milky Way high
column density ﬁlament, located close to the northern portion of
M31’s disk, is obvious. The corresponding M2 map displayed
in Fig. 6 (top right hand panel) reveals a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
structure. The disk of M31 is easy to identify as is the south-
ern streams visually emerging from it. Prominent are also the HI
clouds in between M31 and M33 and isolated HI features like
the Davies cloud (Davies 1975). The M2 values of the second
moment map are measures for the FWHM of the individual HI
object in addition to their separation in radial velocity.

The “dominant average gas” is determined by calculating the
appropriate moments maps M0 and M2 for the radial velocity
range −75 ≤ vLSR[km s−1] ≤ −25. Figure 6 (bottom left) dis-
plays the zeroth moment map of that velocity interval. M31’s
HI disk emission is only marginally visible next to the domi-
nating Milky Way high latitude HI structure. Comparing both
zeroth moment maps in Figure 6 shows almost the same Galac-
tic high latitude HI column density structure. Figure 6 (bottom
right) displays the corresponding second moment map M2. It re-
veals highly complex and irregular structures. This map is a mea-
sure for the line width and the velocity structure of the “dominant
average gas”.

4.2. ThedifferencesecondmomentmaptowardM31

In the next step we subtract the “dominant average gas” sec-
ond moment map (Fig. 6, bottom right) from the broad veloc-
ity range M2 map (Fig. 6, top right). This diﬀerence second mo-
ment map (∆M2) is displayed in Fig. 7. Most of the area of in-
terest has a ∆M2 value of exactly zero. These areas indicate
the location of Milky Way gas without any confusion with HI
gas at more negative radial velocities. A high ∆M2 value is ob-
served toward the top righthand corner, where HI emission as-
sociated with HVC complex H is observed (Simon et al. (2006),

Article number, page 6 of 10

−240 ≤ vLSR[km s−1] ≤ −170). Of particular interest with re-
spect to M 31, however, is the gas with second moment val-
ues up to 10 km s−1. These excess ∆M2 values are associated
with the structure displayed in Fig. 1 and apparently represent
the M31 cloud. The lopsidedness of HI gas around M31 is eas-
ily traceable. Even faint HI structures covering a broad velocity
range are signiﬁcantly detectable due to their large oﬀset in ra-
dial velocity from the “dominant average gas”.

The M31 cloud reveals, in particular for the northern HI
structure (a), a close association with and a smooth and con-
tinuous connection to the M 31 HI disk in that map. Individ-
ual M31-HVCs that were previously known are apparent (see
Thilker et al. 2004, Fig. 2). They all show up with a ∆M2 devi-
ation value comparable to that of the M31 cloud features. This
implies that the previously identiﬁed M31-HVC gas is a subset
of the HI gas highlighted by the diﬀerence second moment map
∆M2. It does not uniquely conﬁrm that all these gaseous struc-
tures belong physically to M 31 but displays the gas not belong-
ing to the Milky Way galaxy. The coherent large scale spatial
structure displayed in the ∆M2 map in combination with Fig. 4 is
a strong argument for the striking hypothesis that the M31 cloud
belongs to M31’s HI halo.

Accordingly, the second moment maps give us the chance
to distinguish between coherent gaseous structures superposed
accidentally and moving at diﬀerent radial velocities. The abso-
lute value of that velocity dispersion has no immediate physical
meaning but is a measure of the velocity deviation of a speciﬁc
structure relative to its environment.

5. Discussion

5.1. AbsorptionlinesprobingthenorthernHIstructure

Absorption line spectroscopy contributes additional and inde-
pendent information on the physical properties of the gas.
M31 was the subject of a recent quasar absorption line survey
(Rao et al. 2013) performed with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) equipped with the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS).
Primary aim of this survey was to probe M31’s impact parameter
in comparison to the higher redshifted galaxy population. Using
the COS data, it is feasible to determine the ionization degree
of diﬀerent heavy elements to evaluate the excitation conditions
across a large portion of M31’s halo. For our investigation here,
the quasar sightline 0043+4234 is of major interest. It probes the

Fig. 6. Zeroth and second moment maps toward M 31. Top: The zeroth moment (left) and the second moment map (right) calculated for the radial
velocity range −588 ≤ vLSR[km s−1] ≤ −25 are presented. The disk of M31 is easy to identiﬁed in both maps. Prominent in the second moment
map are also the lopsided HI structures displayed in Fig. 1. In addition, HI clouds along the bridge toward M33 and isolated HI features like
Davies cloud (Davies 1975) show by their color coding their deviation from the Milky Way galaxy HI emission. Bottom: zeroth moment (left) and
the second moment map (right) calculated for the radial velocity range −75 ≤ vLSR[km s−1] ≤ −25. About 99% of all HI in the area of interest are
comprised in these maps. While the top and bottom zeroth moment maps displayed appear to diﬀer only in the extent of M 31 HI disk, the second
moment maps display totally diﬀerent structures. We note the very diﬀerent velocity ranges of both second moment maps and the equal column
density range of the zeroth moment maps.

of sight, the “deblending” technique of Rao et al. (2013) local-
izes the low-ionized Milky Way species at vLSR = −73 km s−1
and the high-ionized ones at vLSR = −1 km s−1. The corre-
sponding absorption line complexes attributed to M 31 are at
vLSR = −233 km s−1 and vLSR = −191 km s−1, respectively. Be-
cause absorption line spectroscopy is sensitive to column den-
sities orders of magnitudes below the level that we detect in
HI emission, the radial velocity limit for the Milky Way gas of
vLSR = −73 km s−1 is really important here. It implies that gas
at more negative radial velocities are most likely not physically
associated with the Milky Way galaxy.

A dedicated sensitive GBT HI spectrum toward this quasar
sight line (Rao et al. 2013) is consistent with this ﬁnding, be-
cause it constrains the Doppler velocity range occupied by
M31’s HI gas to −259 ≤ vLSR ≤ −93 km s−1. This velocity range
obviously includes the HI emission at vLSR = −115 km s−1 asso-

ciated with the northern HI structure (a). Gas at more negative
velocities than vLSR = −73 km s−1 appear to belong to M 31 and
its environment and not to the Milky Way galaxy.

Adopting the hypothesis that the whole northern HI structure
(a) is physically related to M31, we estimate its linear size to
20 kpc and its HI mass to MHI ≥ 4.6 · 107 M⊙. Owing to the
limited sensitivity of EBHIS and the applied radial velocity limit
for this mass evaluation at vLSR = −95 km s−1 we could only
determine a lower limit.

5.2. ThesouthernHIstreams(b)

Inspecting Fig. 1 (righthand panel) clearly shows that the veloc-
ity structure of the southern HI streams (b) is remarkably diﬀer-
ent from that of M31’s disk. While this part of M31’s HI disk ro-
tates toward the Earth with velocities up to vLSR = −600 km s−1,

Fig. 7. Displayed is the diﬀerence second moment map (∆M2) calculated from the second moment map of the velocity range −588 ≤
vLSR[km s−1] ≤ −25 and −75 ≤ vLSR[km s−1] ≤ −25 shown in the righthand panels of Fig. 6. We set the lower threshold to 1 km s−1.

the HI streams (b) are detected at much lower velocities around
vLSR = −115 km s−1. The gap in radial velocity between the M31
disk rotation and the base points of the ﬁlaments probably im-
plies that the origin of the southern HI ﬁlaments is physically
displaced from the approaching side of M31’s disk. Also a de-
celeration of ∆vLSR = 20 km s−1 is observed from the base points
to the end of the HI streams in the north.

While the HST-COS data (Rao et al. 2013) also probe this re-
gion of interest by the quasar 0032+3946 sight line, unique clues
cannot be drawn from that data. Blending of the gas absorption
features under investigation with the Milky Way galaxy species
do not allow the relative contributions to be disentangled.

5.3. IstheshapeoftheM31cloudrelatedtotheproper

motionofM31?

The proper motion of M31 has been determined by HST mea-
surements (Sohn et al. 2012). The proper motion direction is ori-
ented approximately from the top right to the bottom lefthand
corner in the representation of Fig. 1. Accordingly, the south
eastern boundary of the M31 HI disk can be considered as the
“leading edge”. Here, the HI emission is sharply deﬁned along
this edge, while the extra-planar M31 cloud HI emission ex-
tends towards the opposite direction. One scenario to form a
lopsided HI M31 cloud is the ram–pressure interaction of M31
with an ambient medium like the warm hot intergalactic medium
(WHIM, Davé et al. (2001)).

According to standard cosmology, the plasma temperature of
the WHIM is assumed to be TWHIM = 106 − 107 K. The HI halo
structures identiﬁed here have gas pressures around 10 K cm−3,
deduced from the HI line width, implying a WHIM volume den-
sity of nWHIM = 10−5 − 10−6 cm−3.

M31’s space velocity, relative to the hypothetical WHIM,
which is here thought to be at rest in the Local Group’s gravi-
tational potential, is |v| ∼ 40 km s−1 (Diaz et al. 2014). Even in
case of a (TWHIM, nWHIM) = (106 K, 10−5 cm−3) WHIM plasma
temperature, volume density combination M31 moves through
the WHIM at subsonic speed (cs ≃ 80 km s−1). The correspond-
ing WHIM mass densities and M31 proper motion velocity are
suﬃcient neither to disrupt large amounts of gas from M31
disk nor to trigger enhanced star formation (Steinhauser et al.

the disrupted HI disks of Virgo cluster galaxies is apparent
(Chung et al. 2009).

5.3.1. Displacement between stars and gas of And XIX and

And XX

While the lopsided Andromeda halo does not allow deriving con-
clusive evidence for any interaction between the galaxy and an
ambient medium, And XIX and And XX are in this respect of
particular interest here.

Figure 8 shows the EBHIS HI column density distribution to-
ward AndXIX and AndXX. As reported by Grcevich & Putman
(2009) and Spekkens et al. (2014),
there is a striking non-
detection of HI gas toward Milky Way dwarf galaxies but also
towardAndromeda’s satellite galaxies. Using the EBHIS data we
can conﬁrm the non-detection and then consistently lower their
limits partly by a factor of two to ten (Kerp et al., in prep). How-

with the low radial velocity clouds reported here. The systemic
population clouds I to IV and VII are located at larger positional
oﬀsets.

Recently, the PANDAS ﬁeld (Martin et al. 2014) has been
investigated again to search for foreground stellar streams out
to a distance of 30 kpc from the Milky Way galaxy. The major
aim of their analysis was to distinguish between Milky Way halo
features and those belonging to the M31/M33 system of galax-
ies. None of the already known and the newly identiﬁed stellar
structures are positionally coincident with the low radial veloc-
ity HI ﬁlament reported here. Accordingly, the HI ﬁlament un-
der investigation does not appear to be associated positionally
with any known Milky Way galaxy foreground structure. This
suggests there is an association with Andromeda’s intergalactic
environment.

In contrast to the HI clouds at systemic velocities, the low-
velocity HI ﬁlament reveals a pronounced core-halo structure.
The low-velocity clouds cores have HI column densities around
NHI ≃ 1 · 1019 cm−2. While the individual HI cores in the ﬁla-
ment have comparable brightness temperatures, their linear ex-
tents cover a broader range of 3 to 13 kpc at Andromeda’s dis-
tance, corresponding to a HI mass range of 1 · 105 M⊙ ≤ M ≤
17 ·105 M⊙. We ﬁnd HI line widths (FWHM) of about 30 km s−1,
implying upper limits for kinetic temperatures of Tkin ≃ 2·104 K.
These values are quantitatively comparable to those of the clouds
at systemic velocities (Wolfe et al. 2013).

6. Summary and conclusions

We presented EBHIS ﬁrst coverage data of the Andromeda’s
galaxy and its environment. Analyzing channels maps of M 31
and its environment up to vLSR = −25 km s−1, we identiﬁed a
smooth and coherent M 31 HI halo structure north of the stel-
lar disk. This structure was previously identiﬁed by Blitz et al.
(1999) as M31 cloud. Inspecting a diﬀerence second moment
(∆M2) map of the M 31 and the Milky Way galaxy, we showed
that this HI halo structure deviates signiﬁcantly from the Milky
Way HI gas at high galactic latitudes in the velocity regime
−75 ≤ vLSR [km s−1] ≤ −25, which represents the dominant
fraction of the HI gas. Quantitatively we used this method to
identify all previously known M31-HVC structure with column
densities above NHI = 1 · 1019 cm−2. Accordingly, we proposed a
physical association of the M31 cloud with M31, ﬁrst described
by Blitz et al. (1999). The coherent velocity pattern between
Andromeda’s tip of the HI disk and the northern part of the
M31 cloud suggests there is a physical location of this HI struc-
ture in Andromeda’s halo. The latest HST absorption line mea-
surements (Rao et al. 2013) are consistent with the association
of the M31 cloud with the Andromeda galaxy.

Toward the southern portion of Andromeda’s HI disk, we
observed coherent stream-like HI ﬁlaments (b) that originating
at the very southeastern edge of the HI disk. These HI streams
extend several degrees across the northwestern portion of M31’s
halo. The brightest portions of these stream-like ﬁlaments have
been previously reported as individual M31-HVCs by dedicated
GBT observations (Thilker et al. 2004).

Assuming that all these HI structures are associated with
M31, we derived a total HI mass of about Mhalo = 1 · 108 M⊙
for M31’s extraplanar gas. This is less than Blitz et al. (1999)
reported for the M31 cloud but our mass estimate has to be con-
sidered as only a lower limit.

While the well-deﬁned positional coincidence of the sharp
boundary of the southern part of the M31 cloud with the HI
rim of Andromeda’s southern disk is suggestive of ram pressure

−95 km s−1) of the HI emission in between M31 and M33. All HI emis-
sion displayed exceeds the applied 5-σ threshold of the EBHIS data.
The crosses mark the location of the known HI clouds at systemic veloc-
ities (Wolfe et al. 2013). The systemic velocity clouds V and VI closely
match the lower velocity clouds in position, while the others are oﬀ-
set by a few degrees. The low-velocity cloud population shows up as a
single ﬁlament with a pronounced core–halo structure.

ever, these investigations are targeted observations pointing ex-
actly at the stellar bodies of all these dwarf galaxies. The EBHIS
column density map shown in Fig. 8 discloses HI gas close to
but not at the stellar bodies of the dwarf galaxies AndXIX and
AndXX. The positions of their stellar bodies are marked by the
30′ circles in that ﬁgure. In the case of AndXIX, the HI gas
has almost the same radial velocity with vLSR ≃ −115 km s−1
as the stellar component of vLSR ≃ −112 km s−1 (Collins et al.
2013). The HI gas is displaced from the stellar body and aligned
in an extended linear ﬁlament. Also adopting the Collins et al.
(2013) distance determination of 820 kpc for this HI ﬁlament
yields about MHI(And XIX) ∼ 3.8 · 107 M⊙.

A similar HI structure is located close to AndXX (Fig. 8).
Here, the HI radial velocity (vLSR = 117 km s−1) is a factor
of three lower than that of the stellar body. Only an ensemble
of four stars could be identiﬁed to be probably associated with
AndXX (Collins et al. 2013). Accordingly, improved stellar data
of AndXX are important to test this positional correlation with
the HI gas.

5.4. TheM31/M33HIbridgecloudpopulation

Inspecting the whole area shown in Fig. 1, we ﬁnd a popula-
tion of low radial velocity HI clouds between M31 and M33;
for a closer look, see also Fig. 9. These individual clouds are
embedded within a common envelope of neutral gas, forming
a coherent HI ﬁlament. The HI ﬁlament is located at and ori-
ented parallel to the northern boundary of the giant stellar stream
(Ibata et al. 2001, 2007).

The individual low velocity clouds of that HI ﬁlament are lo-
cated in the same area of the M31/M33 bridge as the known pop-
ulation of systemic velocity HI clouds (Wolfe et al. 2013). Ear-
lier, more sensitive investigations (Lockman et al. 2012) toward
a neighboring region of interest also report a low-radial velocity
HI gas component that has been proposed to be associated with
And XV and AndII. However, these HI structures are position-
ally oﬀset from those reported here, and their brightness temper-
atures are below our applied 5-σ cutoﬀ. The systemic velocity
clouds V and VI (Wolfe et al. 2013) coincide well in position

A&Aproofs:manuscript no. AA_M31_corr

interaction, quantitatively the HI streams appear to be too ex-
tended to only be formed by that process. The inelastic collision
of dwarf galaxies with M31’s stellar disk also provide a viable
explanation for the existence of the stream-like HI ﬁlaments.

It is puzzling that the northern HI structure (a) and the south-
ern HI streams (b) show up with comparable Doppler velocities.
In the case of the diﬀerent physical origins of both HI structures,
this coincidence in radial velocity is unexpected. The same holds
true for the low velocity HI ﬁlament oriented along the northern
rim of the giant stellar stream between M33 and M31.

More sensitive wide-ﬁeld HI studies of M31 and its environ-
ment are needed to construct a consistent view of its HI distri-
bution. In addition to tidal forces and dwarf galaxy impacts into
M31’s stellar disk, the ram pressure interaction of M31 with its
ambient WHIM component might be considered further. High
resolution ultraviolet absorption line spectroscopy data are ur-
gently needed to ﬁnally clarify the origin of the lopsided giant
HI halo of M31.
