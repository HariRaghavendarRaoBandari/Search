EXPONENTIALLY CONCAVE FUNCTIONS AND HIGH

DIMENSIONAL STOCHASTIC PORTFOLIO THEORY

SOUMIK PAL

Abstract. We consider the following problem in stochastic portfolio theory.
Are there portfolios that are relative arbitrages with respect to the market
portfolio over very short periods of time under realistic assumptions? We an-
swer a slightly relaxed question aﬃrmative in the following high dimensional
sense, where dimension refers to the number of stocks being traded. Very
roughly, suppose that for every dimension we have a continuous semimartin-
gale market such that (i) the vector of market weights in decreasing order has
a stationary regularly varying tail with an index between −1 and −1/2 and (ii)
zero is not a limit point of the relative volatilities of the stocks. Then, given a
probability η < 1 arbitrarily close to one, two arbitrarily small , δ > 0, and an
arbitrarily high positive amount M , for all high enough dimensions, it is possi-
ble to construct a functionally generated portfolio such that, with probability
at least η, its relative value with respect to the market at time δ is at least M ,
and never goes below (1 − ) during [0, δ]. There are two phase transitions; if
the index of the tail is less than −1 or larger than −1/2. The construction uses
properties of regular variation, high-dimensional convex geometry and concen-
tration of measure under Dirichlet distributions. We crucially use the notion
of (K, N ) convex functions introduced by Erbar, Kuwada, Sturm [EKS15] in
the context of curvature-dimension conditions and Bochner’s inequalities.

1. Introduction

We start by recalling the usual set-up of stochastic portfolio theory. See the
survey [FK09] for more details. Although we will use words such as portfolio,
market, and stocks for alluding to their economic interpretation, no knowledge of
these quantities are required for understanding the mathematical problem that
follows. At a purely mathematical level we will be studying universal properties
of stochastic integrals in high dimensions. However, the economic terminology will
give us a real world interpretation of an interesting high-dimensional phenomenon.

Our state space is the open unit simplex in Rn, n ≥ 2, deﬁned by

The dimension n represents an equity market that has n stocks. We consider time
to be continuous. At any point of time t, let Xi(t) > 0 be the market capitalization

we have a market for every dimension.
It is possible to have them on diﬀerent
probability spaces, but for notational convenience we will assume that they are all
represented on a single ﬁltered probability space (M,F = {Ft, t ≥ 0} , P). This
can be done without loss of generality. For n = 1, we have a trivial situation.
To avoid constantly make exception to this case, we will let N refer to the set
{2, 3, 4, . . .}. For any n ∈ N, we deﬁne a portfolio in dimension n to be an F-

µ(n)(t), then this portfolio is called the market portfolio. Its value can be thought
of as a capitalization-weighted index (such as S&P 500 or Russell 1000) which
represents the performance of the entire market.

What we are interested is the relative value of a portfolio with respect to the
market portfolio, deﬁned as the ratio of the value of the portfolio π(n) over that of
the market portfolio. We will denote this relative value process by (Vn(t), t ≥ 0)
where Vn(0) ≡ 1. This process can be written as an exponential stochastic integral
of the following form:

where E(Lt) for a continuous semimartingale L is the process exp (Lt − (cid:104)L(cid:105)t /2).
We now recall the deﬁnition of relative arbitrage from [FK09, page 113]. A
portfolio π(n) is said to be a relative arbitrage (or, more colloquially, beats the
market) if there is a time Tn > 0 and a q > 0 such that

We will now introduce a new deﬁnition by relaxing the above requirement.

(cid:0)π(n), n ∈ N(cid:1) is an asymptotic short term relative arbitrage (ASTRA) opportunity

Deﬁnition 1. (Asymptotic short term relative arbitrage) We say that a sequence

that
(i) limn→∞ Tn = 0 and limn→∞ Mn = ∞.
(ii) ∃ q > 0 such that P (inf 0≤t≤Tn Vn(t) ≥ q) = 1 for all n ∈ N.
(iii) Moreover, we have limn→∞ P (Vn(Tn) ≥ Mn) = 1.

The deﬁnition of ASTRA is similar to that of asymptotic arbitrage introduced

in [KK94] and studied further in [KS96], [KK98], [Kle00], and [CKT14].

Our main result shows the existence of such ASTRA opportunities under the fol-
lowing assumptions. A more general version involving regularly varying sequences
appear as Theorem 13. Fix α ∈ [1/2, 1]. Suppose ν(n) ∈ ∆(n) is given by the

Plainly, ν(n) has an asymptotic Pareto or Zipf distribution tail with slope −α. For
a deﬁnition of Pareto or Zipf distribution see [SMS09]. Let Dirichlet(γ) refer to the
Dirichlet probability distribution on ∆(n) with parameter γ ∈ (0,∞)n.

The idea of the construction is the following. In every dimension n we construct
a positive concave function around ν(n) that is highly concave in every direction in a

certain sense. However, this requires the diameter of the domain of the function to
be O(1/

n for large n. Thus, such
a concave function can be eﬀectively constructed on a large enough subset of ∆(n).
By our assumption, the process µ(n) spends a signiﬁcant amount of time before its
ﬁrst exit from this large subset with a high probability. These facts, along with the
increasing diﬀerence between the L2 and L1 norms of regularly varying sequences,
gives the portfolio a very large relative value.

√

The proofs break down if either α < 1/2 or α > 1. The latter case is understand-
able. The extreme inequality in the market weights eﬀectively reduces the dimen-
sionality of the problem. Since most volatility is generated by the largest market
weights, increasing dimension gives us little advantage. The case of α < 1/2 is more
mysterious. This is the case of too little inequality and is probably related to the fact

Fernholz [Fer99], [Fer02, Section 3.3] observed that such portfolios do exist under
observable conditions in real-world markets (which martingales do not satisfy). See
also [FK05] and [FKK05].
Fernholz assumed an Itˆo process µ(n) satisfying two conditions. (i) ∃ η ∈ (0, 1)

condition is called being suﬃciently volatile. He then showed that exist explicit
portfolio maps π such that limt→∞ V (t) = ∞, irrespective of the law of µ.

The time that it takes to beat the market is of central importance. A natural
question to ask is whether, given any small T > 0, there exists a relative arbitrage
portfolio π(n) such that Tn ≤ T with probability one. The challenge, as in any
problem of stochastic portfolio theory, is to make as few assumptions (preferably
observable) as possible on the market process. Several recent articles have tried to
resolve this question. In [FKK05], it was shown that such portfolios do exist under
the condition of diversity. However, the solution is not practical, since to make any
signiﬁcant gain from those portfolios we require an astronomical initial investment.
The authors also mention the diﬃculties of implementation on [FKK05, page 16].
Another solution was posed by [BF08], inspired by the previous work [FK05] un-
der the condition that the smallest stock in the market has an extreme volatility. To

Recently, another solution has been proposed by Fernholz in [Fer15] where it
is assumed that the entropy of the market weights satisfy an almost sure time-
homogeneity property. As with the previous solutions, the outperformance is not
signiﬁcant enough for these portfolios to be feasible.

On a complimentary note, Fernholz, Karatzas, and Ruf [FKR15] have shown

examples in ﬁnite dimensions where short-term relative arbitrages do not exist.

Let us justify our assumptions. Consider condition (i) in Assumption 1. It is
well-known that market weights have Pareto tails. See Figure 1 which is taken
from [Fer02]. Each curve represents log of ranked market weights in decreasing
order against log of the rank, sampled once every decade from all major U.S. stock
markets for eight decades. The curves are roughly linear, and hence the market
weights are roughly Pareto, where the qualiﬁer ‘some labeling’ in condition (i) refers
to rearrangement according to decreasing size. The appearance of Zipf distribution
is not an isolated incident. Pareto tail are ubiquitous in econometric data. See the
articles [Axt01] and [Gab09], the book [SMS09], or the post [Tao09]. In Section 6,
we work with real data from June to December of 2015. The Pareto curve with a
slope in [−1/2,−1] remains valid as can be seen in Figure 2.

scaling. As will be clear from the proofs, our statements can be generalized to the

natural scale of ﬂuctuation. One way to think about it is that the uniform distribu-

Thus, for any t, there exists some labeling of coordinates which makes the se-

Consider condition (ii). Since Pareto is a stable conﬁguration for the market
weights, it cannot escape from a neighborhood of ν(n) very fast. This is supported
by real data as shown in Figure 3.

Condition (iii) is a weaker requirement that the condition that the relative volatil-

ities of the stocks is bounded away from zero. To wit, suppose

1.2. Outline. Our results are true when the market weights decay as a regularly
varying sequence of a range of indices. We recall the notion of regularly varying
sequences in Section 2. In Section 3 we introduce the notion of exponentially con-
cave functions and relate them the recent notion of (K, N ) convexity from [EKS15].
We also recall the concept of functionally generated portfolios. In Section 4, we
prove a concentration of measure theorem for Dirichlet distributions with regularly
varying parameters. In Section 5 we combine the ideas to prove a much more gen-
eralized version of Theorem 1. Finally in Section 6 we provide theoretical models
that satisfy our assumptions and show that the strategy works on real market data.

range α ∈ [1/2, 1] but not elsewhere.

To generalize the above calculations for other sequences we need to assume more
regularity conditions on our sequence (an, n ∈ N). We begin by recalling the deﬁ-
nition of regularly varying sequences introduced in [GS73].
Deﬁnition 2. We call a sequence (Kn, n ∈ N) of positive terms to be regularly
varying with index ρ ∈ [0, 1] if there is another positive sequence (Ln, n ∈ N) such
that
(i) Kn ∼ cLn, for some positive constant c,
(ii) and limn→∞ n (1 − Ln−1/Ln) = ρ.
When ρ = 0 we call the sequence slowly varying.

Regularly varying sequences admit a Karamata representation in the spirit of
regularly varying functions on the positive half line. The following result is from
[GS73, Section 2].
Theorem 2. If (Kn, n ∈ N) is a regularly varying sequence of index ρ then it has
the representation

(8)

Kn = cnnρ exp

where limn→∞ cn = c > 0 and limn→∞ εn = 0. Here (εn, n ∈ N) can be taken to
be the sequence (n (1 − Ln−1/Ln) , n ∈ N).
Remark 1. If the sequence (cn, n ∈ N) can be replaced by the constant c above,
then the representation is called the normalized Karamata representation. This
notion will be relevant later in Deﬁnition 7 and Assumption 3.
For ρ ∈ [0, 1], let α = 1 − ρ. The hyperharmonic sequence

n , n ∈ N(cid:17)

H (α)

(cid:16)

is a

regularly varying sequence of index ρ. Here, we take H (α)
n = Kn. The fact that
it satisﬁes the deﬁnition is the consequence of the estimate (5). Notice that, for
ρ ∈ [0, 1], we have

and representation (8) is valid for the choice

In that case, we can take Ln = H (α)
(say) εj = jρ/H (1−ρ)
Lemma 3. Suppose (Hn, n ∈ N) is a regularly varying sequence with index ρ > 0,
then it satisﬁes condition (i) in Assumption 2. Additionally, if ρ ∈ (0, 1/2) and
limn→∞ n (1 − Hn−1/Hn) = ρ, then, it satisﬁes the conditions in Assumption 2.
Proof. Condition (i) follows from the result in [GS73] that regularly varying se-
quences can be embedded in regularly varying functions by deﬁning K(x) = K((cid:98)x(cid:99))
on [1,∞). However, regular varying functions with a positive index diverge at in-
ﬁnity.
i ≤ ai for every i. Hence Rn ≤ 1/Hn = o(1).

The case of slowly varying sequences have to be dealt separately since sequences
that admit ﬁnite positive limits are also slowly varying and do not satisfy Assump-
tion 2 (i). Moreover, as we see from (7), the case of ρ = α = 1/2 is also delicate
due to the presence of logarithmic terms. For these two boundary cases, we will
make appropriate assumptions later in the text. In any case, for the rest of the
text we will always assume that the sequence (ai, i ∈ N) is such that (Hn, n ∈ N)
is regularly varying of index ρ ∈ [0, 1/2] and satisﬁes Assumption 2.

3. (K, N ) exponentially concave functions

We begin with a deﬁnition. 1

Deﬁnition 3. A real-valued function ϕ on an open convex domain D in Rn is
said to be exponentially concave if exp (ϕ) is a concave function on D. For usual
practices in convex analysis, we will assume our functions to take the value −∞
outside their domains, thereby extending them to the entire space.

As shown in [PW15], the gradient maps of the above class of functions arise as
solutions to a novel and interesting optimal transport problem. Independently, the
closely related concept of (K, N ) convexity has been very recently introduced in
an article by Erbar, Kuwada, and Sturm [EKS15]. It is related to the curvature-
dimension condition (K standing for a lower bound on the Ricci curvature while N
is an upper bound on the eﬀective dimension) and leads to fascinating behavior of
entropy over heat ﬂows. For our purpose, we will modify the deﬁnition slightly.

The right hand side above represents the scalar −K/N multiplied with the identity
matrix and the inequality is in the sense of two nonpositive-deﬁnite matrices. If
the Hessian does not exist in the classical sense, interpret it as a measure in the
sense of Alexandrov.

Alternatively, one can write the above as

The above inequality is the usual ordering of two nonpositive-deﬁnite matrices.

We will focus exclusively on the case when N = 1 and K = n, the number of
stocks. Thus, in Rn, we will only consider (n, 1) exponentially concave functions.
The following is a fundamental example.

n(cid:107)x − x0(cid:107) < π/2 is (n, 1) exponentially concave.

Moreover, consider any (n, 1) exponentially concave function ϕ and let x0 be its

n(cid:107)x − x0(cid:107)) on the

subset of {x :

g(t) = Φ(γt). Then

tion and the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality implies that g(cid:48)(cid:48)(t) ≤ −ng(t). Since this
holds for every choice of x, y, it proves our claim.

approximation by approximating the function with inﬁmal convolutions with a
sequence of smooth convex functions. The claim now follows from [EKS15, Lemma
2.2, part (iii)] by considering, as before, the line γt = x0 + t(x − x0). The cited
lemma is itself a consequence of comparison theorem for one-dimensional concave
functions considered as a function of t over the geodesic (γt, t ∈ [0, 1]).

Remark 2. By a change of coordinates it is easy to see that the concept of (K, N ) can
be generalized in the following way. Let Σ be an n× n nonnegative deﬁnite matrix.
Deﬁne a norm (cid:107)x(cid:107)Σ =
x(cid:48)Σx. Consider the function ϕ(x) = log cos ((cid:107)x − x0(cid:107)Σ)
over the domain (cid:107)x − x0(cid:107)Σ < π/2. Then, Φ = exp(ϕ) satisﬁes the inequality

√

Hess Φ(x) ≤ −Σ,

Φ(x)

and ϕ is the maximal one satisfying the above in the sense of Lemma 4.

We now recall the concept of functionally generated portfolios [Fer02, Chapter

3], [PW15, Sec 2.3].
Deﬁnition 5. Let ϕ be an exponentially concave function on Rn whose domain
includes ∆(n). Assume ϕ is diﬀerentiable on its domain. We deﬁne a map π :
∆(n) → ∆(n) by the following recipe. For every p ∈ ∆(n), let v := ∇ϕ(p) denote
the gradient of ϕ at p. Denote the coordinates of π(p) by (π1, . . . , πn). Then,

(9)

= vi + 1 − (cid:104)p, v(cid:105) .

πi
pi

In other words, the vector of coordinate ratios (πi/pi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n) is the projec-
tion of the gradient ∇ϕ(p) on the hyperplane {y ∈ Rn : (cid:104)y, p(cid:105) = 1}.

The above portfolio can now be traded on process of market weights µ(·). Assume
that ϕ is twice continuously diﬀerentiable on its domain. Let Φ = exp (ϕ). Then the
following expression for log V (·) is known as the Fernholz’s decomposition formula.
See [Fer02, Theorem 3.1.5].

consider the portfolio generated by the exponentially concave function ϕ(x) =
log cos (c(cid:107)x − x0(cid:107)) as per Deﬁnition 5. We will refer to this class of portfolios
as the cosine portfolios.

4. The Dirichlet concentration

Suppose we are given a sequence a(∞) as in Subsection 2.2. For every n ≥ 2,
consider the unit simplex in Rn, given in (1). We can get an element in ∆(n) by
deﬁning ν(n) = (a1, . . . , an) /Hn.
Fix γ := (γ1, . . . , γn) ∈ (0,∞)n for some n ≥ 2. Recall the Dirichlet distribution
with parameter γ, denoted by Dirichlet(γ). This is a probability distribution on
the unit simplex given by the joint density at a point x ∈ ∆(n):

distribution has mean ν(n) and the same concentration as the uniform distribution

in this sequence around their means.

It is not hard to believe that if X is distributed according to the uniform dis-
n(cid:107)X − E(X)(cid:107) has exponentially decaying
tribution on the unit simplex, then
tails away from its mean. However, when ν(n) itself is atypical for the uniform
distribution this exponential decay starts failing.
We are now ready to prove our concentration estimate. As always, we will
assume that (Hn, n ∈ N) is regularly varying of index ρ ∈ [0, 1/2]. However, the
proofs are somewhat diﬀerent for the following two cases: (i) the subcritical case
when ρ ∈ (0, 1/2], and (ii) the critical case when ρ = 0. We start with (i).
Suppose we are given the sequence (an, n ∈ N). We will use the following well-
known construction of Dirichlet random variables. Let Z1, Z2, . . . , Zn be a sequence
of independent gamma random variables of scale one such that E(Zi) = nν(n)
. Let
Sn = Z1 + . . . + Zn denote the sequence of their partial sums. Then the vector

vectors (Zi, i ∈ A) and (Zi, i ∈ B), respectively. Similarly, partition ν(n) in two
parts, νA and νB.
Now, it is known that a gamma distribution with mean at least one, being a
log-concave density, satisﬁes a Poincar´e inequality: Var(f ) ≤ CE(f(cid:48))2. If the mean
is α, the Poincar´e constant can be taken to be 12α. See, for example, [BW09,
Remark 1, page 2716]. Since every Zi, i ∈ A, has a mean of more than 1, by the
tensorization property of the Poincar´e inequality, their product measure satisﬁes a
Poincar´e inequality with a constant

only thing that is used in the proof is the common Poincar´e constant. This has
been remarked right afterwards by the author. We now need to ﬁnd an estimate of

We now handle the critical case when (Hn, n ∈ N) is slowly varying. Slowly vary-
ing sequences can display a wide range of properties. For examples, such sequences
can have a ﬁnite limit. Thus, we will impose further regularity conditions.

Recall that a slowly varying sequence can be embedded in a slowly varying
function by deﬁning H(x) = H(cid:98)x(cid:99). The following deﬁnition is taken from [BGT89,
page 24] and adapted to our purpose.
Deﬁnition 7. [Zygmund class] A positive measurable function on (0,∞) is said to
belong to the Zygmund class if, for every α > 0, the function xαf (x) is ultimately
increasing and the function x−αf (x) is ultimately decreasing. A slowly varying
sequence is said to belong to the Zygmund class if the corresponding function in
which it is embedded is in the Zygmund class.

Functions in Zygmund class (see [BGT89, Theorem 1.5.5, page 24]) are slowly
varying and have the property that its Karamata representation can be written as
f (x) ∼ l(x) where

(cid:18)(cid:90) x

(cid:19)

l(x) = c exp

ε(u)

du

.

u

x0

for some positive c, x0 and some measurable bounded function ε vanishing at inﬁn-
ity. That is, in the corresponding representation for sequences (8), one can replace
the convergent sequence (cn, n ∈ N) by the positive limit c and get a normalized
Karamata representation. The harmonic sequence is an example of a sequence in
the Zygmund class as can be easily veriﬁed from deﬁnition.

We also deﬁne super-slow variation from the left inspired by the so-called super-
slow varying functions introduced in [And78] for slowly varying functions. We adapt
the deﬁnition for sequences.
Deﬁnition 8. Suppose (ln, n ∈ N) is a nondecreasing positive sequence satisfying
limn→∞ ln = ∞. A slowly varying sequence (Kn, n ∈ N) is said to be super slowly
varying from the left with respect to (ln, n ∈ N) if

lim
n→∞

K(cid:98)n/lδ

uniformly for all δ ∈ [0, 1].

The following conditions generalize the harmonic sequence.

Lemma 9. Suppose (Hn, n ∈ N) is in the Zygmund class and satisﬁes
(i) limn→∞ nan
(ii) Representation (8) holds for Hn = Kn, cn ≡ c, and that εn ∼ 1/ log n.

Then, (Hn) is super-slowly varying with respect to the sequence ln := log n, n ∈ N.
In particular, uniformly in δ ∈ [0, 1], we have

Since the right side goes to zero, this completes the proof of the ﬁrst claim. The

assume that the conditions of Lemma 9 hold. Then the following holds

Proof. The ﬁrst part of the proof of Proposition 7 remains unchanged. In particular,
the deﬁnition of En and the bound (18) remains the same.
The diﬀerence starts with the deﬁnition of kn. According to the notation in
Lemma 9, consider the sequence kn := (cid:98)n/ln(cid:99) where ln = log n. Hence, (kn, n ∈ N)
is a nondecreasing sequence such that limn→∞ kn = ∞. We now show that this
choice of kn satisﬁes a limit corresponding to (20).

As before, let pn := Hkn /Hn. Then limn→∞ pn = 1. The previous lemma again
gives us a partition of {1, 2, . . . , n} in A := {1, 2, . . . , kn} and B := {kn + 1, . . . , n}
such that (Zi, i ∈ A) has a log-concave density and (Zi, i ∈ B) is ‘small’. The
diﬀerence starts again in (28), since in this case limn→∞ pn = 1.
In order to
account for this diﬀerence, we are going to modify (22) and (30).
We get an identical tail bound for (Zi, i ∈ A) as in (22). For (Zi, i ∈ B) we will
forgo the exponential bound and consider a moment bound. To wit, as before in

5. Construction of the ASTRA sequence

We will now collect all the conditions we needed on our sequence (an, n ∈ N) in

the following list.
Assumption 3. Recall that we have a non increasing sequence (an, n ∈ N) such
that each ai ∈ (0, 1). We assume the following conditions on this sequence.
(i) The sequence of partial sums (Hn, n ∈ N) is regularly varying of index ρ ∈

[0, 1/2].

(ii) Recall Rn from (4). Then

lim
n→∞ Rn = 0,

but, nRn = Ω(log n) → ∞.

(iii) limn→∞ nan/Hn = ρ.
(iv) Finally, if ρ = 0, we assume that (Hn, n ∈ N) belongs to the Zygmund class
(Deﬁnition 7) and in its normalized Karamata representation (see Theorem 2
and Remark 1) one can take εn ∼ 1/ log n.

As we have argued before, the hyperharmonic sequences all satisfy the above

requirements.

As mentioned in the Introduction, we assume that there is a probability space
on which, for every dimension n ∈ {2, 3, . . .}, there is a process of market weights

(cid:0)µ(n)(t), t ≥ 0(cid:1) that is a continuous semimartingale on the state space ∆(n).

sumptions, choose the two numbers 0 < r1 < r2 from Assumption 1. First assume
that r2 < π/2 − 1 and let b1 = 1 + r1 and b2 = 1 + r2. Then, 1 < b1 < b2 < π/2.
Consider two Euclidean balls in Rn:

Then both B1 and B2 are in D(n). We are interested in the intersection D(n)∩∆(n).
If r2 > π/2 − 1, choose a suitable 0 < c < 1 in the cosine portfolio such that
1+r2 < π/(2c) and apply the following argument which is independent of c. Hence,
for the rest of the argument we will assume that 1 < b1 < b2 < π/2.

Lemma 12. Consider a semimartingale process (µ(s), s ≥ 0) satisfying (3). Let
τ be a stopping time such that {µ(s), 0 ≤ s ≤ τ} ⊆ D(n). Then, almost surely, we
have the following lower bound on the drift

Substituting the above lower bound for every µ(s) in (37) gives us the statement

of the lemma.

We can ﬁnally write a statement on the existence of short term arbitrage gener-

alizing Theorem 1. Recall δn, qn from Assumption 1.
Theorem 13. Assume that our sequence (an, n ∈ N) satisfy Assumption 3. Sup-
pose that we are given an  ∈ (0, 1). Then there exists a sequence of portfolios
(πn, n ∈ N) such that the following conclusions are valid. Let Vn(t) denote the
relative value of the portfolio πn at time t. As usual, we always assume Vn(0) = 1.
In the subcritical case, when ρ ∈ (0, 1/2], ﬁx k ∈ N. Then the following hold.
(i) Almost surely, inf 0≤t≤δn Vn(t) ≥ (1 − ) for every n.

(ii) With probability 1 −(cid:0)qn + O(exp(−c1nρ/4))(cid:1), we have
nRn(log n)−1/2(cid:17)

log Vn(δn) = Ω

(cid:16)

.

In the critical case, when ρ = 0, the following conclusions hold.
(i)’ Almost surely, inf 0≤t≤Tn Vn(t) ≥ (1 − ) for every n.

(ii)’ With probability 1 − qn − O(Rn), we have log Vn(Tn) = Ω(cid:0)nRn(log n)−1/2(cid:1).

Proof. First consider the case when  = 1/2. Choose 1 < b1 < b2 < π/2 such that
cos(b2) ≥ 1 −  = 1/2. This is possible since cos(1) ≈ 0.54 > 0.5. Consider the
neighborhoods B1 ⊆ B2 of ν(n) accordingly. Now consider the portfolio generated
by the (n, 1) exponentially concave function ϕ given in Lemma 4 with x0 = ν(n).
Consider the subcritical case. By Proposition 7 and Assumption 1, with prob-
ability at least qn + O(exp(−c1nρ/4)), we get µ(n)(0) ∈ B1 and the process does
√
not exit B2 by time δn. On this event, by Lemma 12, by time δn the total drift

log n), by Assumption 3 and the fact that
for this portfolio is Ω (nRnδn) = Ω(
δn = Ω(1/

log n). On the other hand, the range of ϕ insider B2 is

− log cos (b2) ≤ − log(1 − ).

Thus, it follows from (10) that the relative value of this portfolio never drops below
(1 − ). On the complement of this event, if µ exits B2 before time δn, we convert

24

SOUMIK PAL

our portfolio to the market portfolio. The maximum loss in log relative value is still
(1 − ). This proves the result for the subcritical case. The critical case is similar.
Now, ﬁx any other  ∈ (0, 1). If  > 1/2, then we are covered by the case of
 = 1/2. Suppose  ≤ 1 − cos(1). Consider the cosine portfolio from Deﬁnition 6
by ﬁxing a positive constant c0 < 1 and considering the generating function

By Remark 2, on the above domain we get

1

Hess Φ(x) ≤ −c0I.

Φ(x)

Now, choose c0 such that cos(c0) > 1 − . Since cos(·) is decreasing on [0, π/2]
and 1 −  ≥ cos(1), this allows us to choose c0 < 1 to satisfy the requirement of
the previous paragraph. Now, as before, choose 1 < b1 < b2 < π/2 such that
cos(c0b2) > 1 − . We can now repeat the above argument for  = 1/2 to reach the
same conclusion. The constant c0 is absorbed in the big-O notation.
The case of the remaining interval  ∈ (1 − cos(1), 1/2) is now covered by the
case of  = 1 − cos(1) < 1/2.
(cid:3)

The proof of Theorem 1 now follows as a special case of the above result and the

estimates (6) and (7).

6. Theoretical examples and data analysis

Of course, one might ask if there is any process µ(n) that satisﬁes all the con-
ditions in Assumption 1. We are going to show that the stationary Wright-Fisher
(WF) model in dimension n with parameters nν(n) satisﬁes all the conditions of
the theorem. We only consider the subcritical case of ρ ∈ [0, 1/2) for simplicity.

6.1. Theoretical examples. We will refer to the WF process with parameters

the following stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE):

dµ(t) = b (µ(t)) dt + σ (µ(t)) dβ(t),

where

introduced in [FK05].

It is also known (see [Pal11]) that the unique invariant

distribution of WF(cid:0)nν(n)(cid:1) is Dirichlet(cid:0)nν(n)(cid:1). Thus, if µ(0) ∼ Dirichlet(cid:0)nν(n)(cid:1)
and (µ(t), t ≥ 0) evolves according to WF(cid:0)nν(n)(cid:1) the process remains stationary.

Now, ﬁx T > 0, and consider the time interval [0, T ]. It suﬃces to take T = 1

consider the subintervals Ik := (cid:8)(cid:2)(k − 1)/n2, k/n2(cid:3) , k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n2 − 1(cid:9). The

Of course, the above is not particularly practical since a priori we do not know
which dimension to use. However, it is an interesting allusion to the asymptotic
arbitrage theory.

6.2. Evidence from real data. For our data analysis we consider market cap-
italization data from the Russell 1000 universe. Russell 1000 is a capitalization-
weighted index that constitutes of the largest 1000 companies in the U.S. equity
markets. The total market capitalization of all the stocks listed in this index is
more than 90% of the entire market capitalization of all the listed U.S. stocks. We
consider daily market capitalization data of stocks listed in this index for a period
of 130 trading days starting on June 26, 2015, and ending on Dec 30, 2015.

Let us analyze some features of the data to argue that our assumptions are valid.
By the nature of the data we can only trade once a day for six months, which is not
exactly short term. However, the assumptions do not break down completely. In
Figure 2 we show the capital distribution curve as it appears on the ﬁrst date, Jun
26, 2015. We have have ranked the market weights and plotted log µi against log i.
The graph shows a linear plot in the log-log scale for the top 700 stocks and a steep
fall for the last 300. The estimated Pareto slope α for the top part is about 0.95.
If we ignore the bottom 300 non-Pareto portion, this data lies within the range
[1/2, 1] we consider in this paper. Hence, we can take the dimension n = 1000.

Figure 3. Shannon entropy (left) and scaled Euclidean distance
(right) time series.

However, over the course of six months, this slope ﬂuctuates slightly getting
closer to one with time. This can be seen by plotting the entropy of the market
weights as a time series, as done in the left hand image of Figure 3. The graph show
the behavior of the Shannon entropy of the vector of market weights considered as
a discrete probability distribution. The entropy decreases with time showing a
greater concentration of wealth in the larger stocks and the Pareto slope tending to
n remains valid as can be seen on
one. However, our Euclidean distance scaling of
√
the right hand image of Figure 3. The graph shows the scaled Euclidean distance
n(cid:107)µ(t) − µ(0)(cid:107) against time t. The graph shows that this distance varies within
[0.0, 0.4] giving credence to the idea that this scaled distance is of order one.

Figure 4. Comparison of performances of
diversity-weighted, and the cosine portfolio

equal-weighted,

Thus, we face three problems here: (i) how to reduce this problem to justify
short-term? (ii) how to account for a changing slope, and (iii) how to choose the
correct constant c > 0 in the cosine portfolio strategy (Deﬁnition 6) or equivalently
in the Dirichlet distribution. We resolve these problems by dividing the 130 days
in 13 periods of successive 10 days. At the beginning of each period we take the
initial market weights to be our ν(n), which then gets updated in the next period.
We choose c = 3 ad hoc from inspecting the right hand image in Figure 3.

The result of our cosine portfolio (combined over the 13 periods) for c = 3 is
show in Figure 4. The log relative value of the portfolio with respect to the index
is plotted on the y-axis in the bold line. For comparison, we have also shown
the performance over the same data set of the equal weighted portfolio (in dash)
and the diversity-weighted portfolio D1/2 (in dots). For the deﬁnition of the latter
see [FK09, page 119, eqn. (7.1)]. This time period is a particularly bad time for
volatility-harvesting strategies. This has to do with the decrease in entropy and
low volatility in the market. This is the reason why both equal-weighted and the
diversity-weighted portfolios underperform the index at the end of six months. The
cosine portfolio on the other hand makes signiﬁcant gains, more than 15% over
six months which is an annual rate of 30%! But it does underperform initially
(although not by much) which gets erased by the gains in the latter half. Better
data should allow for a ﬁner understanding of its performance and how to optimize
parameters. Unfortunately, the author is limited by the data that he could access.
