Abstract

Topological Kondo Insulators are a class of strongly correlated material which develop protected

Dirac surface states. To date, the ideas of topological protection have been applied to Kondo insu-

lators with the simplest point-group symmetries. Here we demonstrate that nonsymmorphic crystal

symmetries allow us to understand the class of “failed” Kondo insulators, including CeNiSn, CeRhSb

and CeIrSb which exhibit semi-metallic behavior with extreme anisotropy. The presence of non-

symmorphic glide and screw axis symmetries give rise to surface states with a novel M¨obius braiding.

Protected surface states on these M¨obius Kondo insulators can be independently activated on any of

the three orthogonal surfaces, giving rise to a rich phase diagram. The observation of a plateau in

the conductivities of CeNiSn samples, together with the observed anisotropy of the magneto-transport

leads us to predict that this system is a novel topological Kondo insulator with M¨obius-twisted surface

states that can be detected using non-local transport or Angle resolved photoemission (ARPES).

The discovery of topological phases of matter, initiated by the pioneering works on quantum Hall
states in 1980s[1–3] has now evolved into the broad notion of symmetry-protected topological
states of matter. Topological Kondo insulators (TKIs)[4, 5] are a class of symmetry-protected
topological phases which emerge due to the effects of strong correlations. In these materials, the
strong interaction between conduction electrons and local magnetic moments leads to the forma-
tion of a narrow gap associated with the development of Kondo singlets which screen the local
moments[6–9].
In SmB6, the oldest known Kondo insulator, the existence of metallic surface
states has been demonstrated by transport experiments[10–13] and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES)[14–16]. These results have identiﬁed SmB6 as a promising candidate for
a TKI.

However, there are examples of failed Kondo insulators, including CeNiSn, CeRhSb, CeIrSb
[17–19] which can not be understood within the canonical picture, in which an insulating gap
develops due to Kondo screening, nevertheless a metallic phase is stabilized at lower temperatures.
Consider the case of CeNiSn, the most studied member and one of the original candidate materials
for TKIs[4]. Here, a small Fermi surface is observed in quantum oscillations that is consistent with
carrier density obtained from Hall conductivity of about n = 10−3e per unit cell[20]. Small Fermi
surface along with a characteristic V-shaped density of states also show up in tunneling and NMR
experiments[21–23]. Moreover varying degrees of anisotropies are observed in Hall conductivity,
thermal transport and magnetoresistance[17, 18, 20, 24–31]. On the other hand, such a small
Fermi surface is highly prone to localization. Different sample preparation and doping effects
can give rise to an insulator as observed in Ref. [32]. In this case, the resistivity saturation at
low temperatures is similar to SmB6. This saturation behavior is explained by the emergence of
metallic surface states in SmB6. One question then arises: is CeNiSn a new TKI?

The standard theory[33, 34] for the unusual properties of failed Kondo insulators posits the
presence of nodal lines in the hybridization gap, which develop in momentum space due to an
angular momentum mismatch between local moments and conduction electrons. The anisotropies
associated with the nodal Fermi surface provide an appealing way of understanding the anisotropic
transport properties[24], but the theory is based on a continuum model for heavy fermions, and
it is not clear whether the line node, which relies on continuous rotational symmetry, survives
the imposition of discrete crystalline symmetries. As we now report, our study of hybridization
models in a nonsymmorphic crystal ﬁnds no symmetry basis for stability of nodal lines: while
models with line nodes can be constructed, the line nodes are ﬁnely tuned and vanish for generic

parameter values, leading to a gap in the quasi-particle spectrum. Here, we present an alternative
theory, arguing that these systems have the potential to form a new type of topological insulator,
protected by nonsymmorphic symmetries.

A central element of our theory is a tight-binding model of CeNiSn with all its salient symme-
tries. The structure of CeNiSn belongs to nonsymmorphic space group No. 62 (P nma), containing
three glide reﬂections, three screw rotations and inversion symmetry, as shown in Fig. 1. Glide re-
ﬂections and screw rotations are nonsymmorphic crystal symmetries which combine a point group
operation (mirror or rotation) and a fractional lattice translation. We ﬁnd that these symmetries
permit nonsymmorphic Kondo insulators to develop a protected surface state, composed of two
Dirac cones. Unlike regular topological insulators, in which scattering between two surface Dirac
cones can open a gap without breaking time-reversal symmetry, the autonomy of these surface

morphic symmetries give rise to a momentum dependent twist that enables the surface states to
be detached from the bulk on the glide plane. Following recent studies[35–38], we refer to these
states as M¨obius-twisted surface states. From the bulk-boundary correspondence, we are able to
deﬁne a Z4 topological invariant, and discuss the experimental signatures of such a phase.

I. TIGHT-BINDING HAMILTONIAN AND NONSYMMORPHIC SYMMETRIES

x, Sy = T(0,1/2,0)Rπ

We begin by constructing a tight-binding Hamiltonian for CeNiSn. CeNiSn has an orthorhom-
bic -TiNiSi structure belonging to nonsymmorphic space group No. 62, P nma, which con-
y , and Sz =
tains an inversion, three screw rotations: Sx = T(1/2,1/2,1/2)Rπ
z as well as three glide reﬂections: Gx = T(1/2,1/2,1/2)Mx, Gy = T(0,1/2,0)My and
T(1/2,0,1/2)Rπ
Gz = T(1/2,0,1/2)Mz where Rπ
i denotes a π rotation about the i-axis, Mj refers to the mirror
operation in the plane perpendicular to the to the j-axis, and T(a,b,c) is the translation opera-
tor along aˆx + bˆy + cˆz. There are four equivalent Ce sites in the unit cell which we label
as {1A, 2A, 1B, 2B} as shown in Fig 1. The Cerium sites form zig-zag chains in the ac plane
which are stacked along the c direction. Fig. 1b shows how glide reﬂection connects inter-chain
sites Gz : (1A, 2A, 1B, 2B) → (2A, 1A, 2B, 1B). These layers are then arranged in an alternat-
ing fashion along the b direction; the alternating layers are related related by the screw rotation
Sy : (1A, 2A, 1B, 2B) → (1B, 2B, 1A, 2A) as shown in Fig. 1c. In the following discussion,
we re-scale the dimensions a, b and c of the unit cell to be unity. When applying the glide reﬂec-
tion and the screw rotation symmetries twice, the system is shifted by a lattice translation, but the
process also involves a double reﬂection or π rotation. The half-integer character of the electrons
means that reﬂections or π-rotations square to −1, and this additional factor means appears in the
square the square of glide reﬂection and screw rotations as follows:

Band structure calculations[39–41] indicate that the relevant orbitals near the chemical poten-
tial derive from the Ce 4f-electrons and Ni 3d-electrons. We now construct a simpliﬁed model
involving these two sets of orbitals. A key ingredient of our model is the hybridization between
the f and d states which involves the transfer of one unit of angular momentum from spin, to
orbital angular momentum. As a result, the hybridization develops a p-wave form-factor[42], and
can be modelled by a simpler model of spin-orbit p orbitals hybridizing with s-wave conduction
electrons. We project the Wannier states of these two sets of orbitals onto the common sites of the
Cerium atoms. The resulting tight-binding Hamiltonian has the structure

H(k) =

where V (k) is the hybridization matrix, Hc and Hf are the nearest hopping matrices for the con-
duction and f-electrons respectively. The detailed structure of this Hamiltonian, which respects
the full nonsymmorphic symmetries of the lattice, is provided in the methods.

II. TOPOLOGICAL SURFACE STATES WITH A M ¨OBIUS TWIST

One symmetry-preserving surface which respects to the glide reﬂection Gz is the (010) surface.
This surface is perpendicular to the glide plane (xy plane) and is also invariant under lattice trans-
lations parallel to the surface. The surface energy dispersion as a function of (kx, kz) is computed
by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in a (010) slab geometry. The corresponding surface Brillouin
zone (BZ) is shown in Fig. 2a. The glide lines on the surface BZ are the set of glide reﬂection
invariant momenta, which are at kz = 0 (path X(cid:48)ΓX) and kz = π (path M(cid:48)ZM). Along these
lines, the Hamiltonian from equation (4) commutes with Gz and can be block diagonalized into
two sectors with two eigenvalues for Gz, g±(kx) = ±ie−ikx/2 along the glide lines.

On the glide lines along X(cid:48)ΓX or M(cid:48)ZM, a pair of surface Dirac cones is stabilized by the
glide reﬂection and time-reversal symmetry. To demonstrate this state (see Fig. 2b), we focus
on path X(cid:48)ΓX. At the X(X(cid:48)) point, the glide eigenvalues are real (±1), which implies that the
members of each Kramers pair derive from the same glide sector, i.e., the glide eigenvalues for
two Kramers pairs are (+1, +1) and (−1,−1). By contrast, at the Γ point, the glide eigenvalues
are imaginary (±i), so time reversal inverts the glide eigenvalue, which indicates that the members
of each Kramers pair come from opposite glide sectors, i.e., the glide eigenvalues for two Kramers
pairs are both (+i,−i). When we connect two Kramers pairs at Γ point to two Kramers pairs at

dispersion on the (010) surface. The two M¨obius twisted surface states are detached from the bulk along the
glide line (X(cid:48)ΓX). b. Schematic showing dispersion along the glide line X(cid:48)ΓX, where red and blue lines
correspond to states with positive and negative glide eigenvalues g±, respectively. Along XM (X(cid:48)M(cid:48)) the
surface states are doubly degenerate due to a combination of time-reversal and glide symmetry, T Gz. The
imaginary glide eigenvalues ±i at the Γ point force the members of each Kramers pair to belong to different
glide sectors, but at the X(X(cid:48)) points the real glide eigenvalues ±1 mean that the members of a Kramers
pair are in the same glide sector. The connectivity between Kramers pairs at the Γ and X ((cid:48)) points gives rise
to the M¨obius character, for if one starts at X(cid:48) and follows the red loop to X, one has to pass a second time
around the loop on the blue line, before one returns to the origin.

X(X(cid:48)) point we obtain the hourglass structure of this surface state[36], which contains two Dirac
cones at the Γ point (Fig. 2b). This surface state contains a M¨obius twist, for if we follow the
arrow from Fig. 2b along the loop X(cid:48)ΓX, we need go around the loop twice: once on a red
and once on a blue branch, before returning to the origin. Due to this unusual connectivity, the
surface state can be detached from the bulk along the loop X(cid:48)ΓX. Fig. 2a displays the result of a
band-calculation on a strip, showing the M¨obius twisted character.

The presence or absence of a M¨obius twisted surface state on the (010) surface deﬁnes a Z2
variable. When we combine this with the additional Z2 variable associated with the possibility of
forming a strong topological insulator, by introducing an additional odd number of Dirac cones
on every surface, we see that the combination of time-reversal and non-symmorphic symmetries
gives rise to a Z2 × Z2 = Z4 topological invariant χ, for which we can construct a corresponding

corresponds to a trivial insulator with no gapless surface states. χ = 1 corresponds to a strong
topological insulating phase with one single surface Dirac cone (Fig. 3b). χ = 2 corresponds to a
nonsymmorphic topological insulator with a M¨obius twisted surface state along X(cid:48)ΓX (M(cid:48)ZM )
path (Fig. 3c). And χ = 3 corresponds to a strong topological insulating phase with three surface
Dirac cones (Fig. 3d).

We now show that the screw rotation operator Sy can give rise to two additional M¨obius
surface states. More precisely, since there no surfaces are invariant under screw rotations,
we consider the combination SyPT , of a screw rotation Sy and a space-time inversion PT ,
which describes the nonsymmorphic symmetry of the (100) and (001) surfaces. To see that
this gives rise to M¨obius surface states, we denote a the surface state on the top/bottom surface

s±(ky) = ±ie−iky/2. Repeating the analysis used for the glide reﬂection Gz, a M¨obius surface
states are stable along the screw axes of the (100) or (001) surfaces. In our speciﬁc model, we
observe a screw-protected M¨obius state on the (001) surface in the χ = 2 phase, together with a
glide-protected M¨obius state on the (010) surface. Whereas, there are no gapless surface states on
the (100) surface in χ = 2 phase. We summarize these results in Fig. 4.

III. DISCUSSION

We have shown that CeNiSn and Kondo insulators with nonsymmorphic symmetries have the
potential to form a new class of topological Kondo insulators with unusual surface states. CeNiSn
is of course a low-carrier density metal, with a small Fermi derived from an indirect band-gap clo-
sure or a lightly doped conduction band, but such small bulk Fermi surfaces are readily localized
by disorder or substitution. This is the likely explanation of the observation of a resistivity plateau
below 10K in antimony-doped CeNiSn1−xSbx[32], where the observation of a resistivity plateau
most likely derives from a metallic topological surface states, as in the case of SmB6. Moreover
the V-shape density of states deduced from NMR experiments and point-contact spectroscopy can
be alternatively be accounted for as a signatures of Dirac cone surface states. The large magne-
toresistance for ﬁelds perpendicular to the a axis may be a consequence of metallic surfaces on the
(010) and (001), combined with an insulating surface on the (100) plane, as shown in Fig. 4.

The conﬁrmation of these ideas requires a direct probe of M¨obius conducting surface states,
either by ARPES measurements, or by non-local[10] or sample thickness dependent transport
measurements[43]. One of the interesting challenges is to delineate M¨obius surface states from
single Dirac surface states. According to Ref.
[44], one-dimensional chiral edge modes from
ferromagnetic domain walls on the surface of SmB6 have been observed with quantized e2/h
conductance. If an analogous ferromagnetic order emerges on a nonsymmorphic surface (induced
by ﬁeld or magnetic impurities), any M¨obius state present will become gapped. The Landau
levels of a M¨obius surface state will contribute to quantized conductance 2(n + 1/2)e2/h, where n
depends on the surface chemical potential. When the Fermi energy is in the gap, the conductance
only comes from the lowest Landau level with n = 0. The transport measurement presumably
comes from both top and bottom surface that give rise to the total conductance 2e2/h, twice that
observed in SmB6. Another way to detect twisted surface states is from Hall bar measurements. In
contrast with the usual topological insulators, where the quantum Hall conductivity σH switches
from −e2/h to e2/h on gating, the twisted surface state will generate three values of quantized
Hall conductivity. When the gate voltage is below(above) two cones, we have σH = −e2/h(e2/h).

9

Whereas the gate voltage is in between two cones, the Hall conductance will vanish, σH = 0.

An interesting future direction is the possibility of nonsymmorphic topological supercon-
ductors. Promising candidates are UCoGe and URhGe, which share the same space group as
CeNiSn[45, 46]. These materials exhibit spin-triplet superconductivity in coexistence with ferro-
magnetism. The topological classiﬁcation of such superconductors is an intriguing future prospect.

VIII. M ¨OBIUS KONDO INSULATORS: SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

A. A tight-binding model based on nonsymmorphic symmetries

Here we derive the tight-binding Hamiltonian for CeNiSn using the following procedure:

1. We deﬁne the symmetry operations on the fermionic operators.

2. We then construct the Hamiltonian by writing down the all the nearest neighbor hopping

and hybridization terms which respect the nonsymmorphic symmetries.

In order to simplify our calculation, we introduce four sets of Pauli matrices: {σi} acts on the spin
basis; {λi} acts on the basis of conduction electrons and f-electrons; {τi} acts on the basis of the
atom labels 1 and 2; {ρi} acts on the basis of the layer labels A and B.

In CeNiSn, 4f-electrons of Ce atoms hybridize with 3d-electrons of Ni atoms. Since the total
angular momentum difference between these two states is one, we orbitally “downfold” the tight-
binding model, replacing it by an equivalent model, reducing the total angular momentum J of
each band by two units. The resulting model involves the hybridization of spin-orbit coupled
p-electrons with s-electrons The highly localized states are then modelled as p-wave Kramers
doublets,

f

f

†
↑|0(cid:105) ≡ |px↓ + ipy↓ + pz↑(cid:105)
†
↓|0(cid:105) ≡ |px↑ − ipy↑ − pz↓(cid:105).

while the mobile conduction electrons are s-wave,

c

†
↑/↓|0(cid:105) ≡ |s↑/↓(cid:105).

(5)

(6)

For further simplicity, we project the conduction electron Wannier states onto the sites of f-
electrons.

B. Symmetries:

Here, we describe the actions of the various symmetry operations in space group No. 62
(P nma) on the Fermi operators. This group contains three screw rotations Sx,y,z, three glide
reﬂections Gx,y,z and an inversion P . In fact, this set of six operators can all be generated from
Gz Sy, in combination with inversion and translation operators, so it is sufﬁcient for us to focus on
these two non-symmorphic operators.

17

1. Glide reﬂection Gz : (X, Y, Z) → (X + 1/2, Y,−Z + 1/2)

The glide reﬂection Gz transforms the f-electrons and conduction electrons as follows

1Lσ(xj)Gz = −(iσ3)σσ(cid:48)f

†

†
1Lσ(cid:48)(xj + a + c),

(7)

where (cid:126)xj is the co-ordinate of the unit cell, (L ∈ [A, B]) and 1 and 2 are the site and layer indices
of atoms within one unit cell, a and c are unit vectors in the x and z directions, respectively, while
σ is the spin index. The glide reﬂection acts in a similar way on the conduction electrons

†

where b is the unit vector in y direction.

4. Other nonsymmorphic symmetries:

By combining inversion, translations, and the above two nonsymmorphic symmetries we
can obtain all the remaining nonsymmorphic symmetries. Thus Gx = T(1,0,1)SyGz, and Gy :
(X, Y, Z) → (X,−Y + 1/2, Z), since

(X, Y, Z) Gz−→ (X + 1/2, Y,−Z + 1/2)

Sy−→ (−X − 1/2, Y + 1/2, Z − 1/2)

T(1,0,1)−→ (−X + 1/2, Y + 1/2, Z + 1/2),

and likewise,

(X, Y, Z)

Sy−→ (−X, Y + 1/2,−Z) P−→ (X,−Y − 1/2, Z)
T(0,1,0)−→ (X,−Y + 1/2, Z).

In a similar fashion, we obtain Sx = T(1,1,1)P Gx and Sz = T(1,0,1)P Gz, since

(X, Y, Z) Gx−→ (−X + 1/2, Y + 1/2, Z + 1/2) P−→ (X − 1/2,−Y − 1/2,−Z − 1/2)

T(1,1,1)−→ (X + 1/2,−Y + 1/2, Z + 1/2).

and

(X, Y, Z) Gz−→ (X + 1/2, Y,−Z + 1/2) P−→ (−X − 1/2,−Y, Z − 1/2)

T(1,0,1)−→ (−X + 1/2,−Y, Z + 1/2).

Gz, Sy and P , and since all the other non-symmorphic symmetries can be expanded in terms of

4. Matrix representation of symmetries

Once we ﬁx the basis of the spinor Ψ(k), we can write down all matrix representations of

symmetries in momentum space. The glide reﬂection is

Gz(k) = −ie−i kx

2 σ3(cos

kx

τ1 + sin

τ2ρ3)λ3,

while the screw rotation and inversion symmetry in the momentum space are

ρ1 + sin

ρ2),

Sy(k) = −ie−i
P = σ0τ0λ3ρ1.

It can be veriﬁed that Gz(k)−1H(kx, ky, kz)Gz(k) = H(kx, ky,−kz), and that Gz(k)2 = −e−ikx,
as expected from the combination of full translation and twice reﬂections (see equation (1) in main
text). Similarly, one can verify that the Hamiltonian transforms under Sy as Sy(k)−1H(kx, ky, kz)Sy(k) =
−1H(k)P = H(−k). In a similar fashion to the glide
H(−kx, ky,−kz) and under inversion, P
reﬂection, Sy(k)2 = −e−iky, which is expected from a 2π rotation and one full lattice transla-
tion (see equation (2) in main text). The transformation of the Hamiltonian under the full set of
non-symmorphic symmetries can be obtained by decomposing them in terms of Gz and Sy, as
described in (VIII B 4).

Time-reversal symmetry has the usual representation, T = iσ2K, where K is the complex

conjugation operator. We have T

−1H(k)T = H(−k).

FIG. 8. Illustration of calculating the Z4 invariant. a, The ”bent” BZ (shaded in yellow) is chosen by
connecting two glide planes to their neighboring plane, which is traversing half the BZ at kx = 0. b, The
Z4 invariant in equation (29) is calculated in the half of the ”bent” BZ (shaded in red).

D. Z4 topological invariant

We give the deﬁnition of the Z4 invariant in symmetry class AII introduced in Ref. [35]. In
the presence of the glide reﬂection symmetry Gz, there are two glide planes in the BZ at kz = 0
and kz = π. In these glide planes, the occupied states can be separated into two sectors with
the glide eigenvalues g± = ±ie−ikx/2. Due to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the existence
of protected surface modes on glide planes are associated with the Berry connections and Berry
curvature on the ”bent” BZ [47]. This ”bent” BZ is chosen by connecting two glide planes to
their neighboring plane, which is traversing half the BZ at kx = 0 (Fig. 8a). In the main text,
we demonstrate the number of Dirac cones along path X(cid:48)ΓXM ZM(cid:48)X(cid:48) is modulo four, which
implies that the Z4 invariant can be deﬁned from calculating the winding number of the Berry
connections of two glide sectors on the ”bent” BZ. Having the same spirit of calculating the Z2
invariant in time-reversal symmetric system, we only need to consider the half of the ”bent” BZ as
shown in Fig. 8b. Along paths a and b, the eigenvalues of glide reﬂection symmetry are real and
the Kramers pairs (|u±,I
