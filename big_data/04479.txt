Abstract

A diphoton excess with an invariant mass of about 750 GeV has been recently
reported by both ATLAS and CMS experiments at LHC. While the simplest
interpretation requires the resonant production of a 750 GeV (pseudo)scalar,
here we consider an alternative setup, with an additional heavy parent particle
which decays into a pair of 750 GeV resonances. This conﬁguration improves the
agreement between the 8 TeV and 13 TeV data. Moreover, we include a dark
matter candidate in the form of a Majorana fermion which interacts through the
750 GeV portal. The invisible decays of the light resonance help to suppress
additional decay channels into Standard Model particles in association with the
diphoton signal. We realise our hierarchical framework in the context of an
eﬀective theory, and we analyse the diphoton signal as well as the consistency
with other LHC searches. We ﬁnally address the interplay of the LHC results
with the dark matter phenomenology, namely the compatibility with the relic
density abundance and the indirect detection bounds.

Introduction

ATLAS and CMS have recently reported a modest excess in the search for Higgs-
like resonances in the diphoton channel at an invariant mass around 750 GeV with
a local signiﬁcance of 3.6σ and 2.6σ, respectively [1, 2]. ATLAS, with 3.2 fb−1 of
collected data, has found an excess of 14 events in the signal region, whereas CMS
had a somewhat lower integrated luminosity of 2.6 fb−1 with a relatively mild excess
consisting of 5 diphoton events. Including the look-elsewhere-eﬀect the signiﬁcances
drop respectively to 2.6σ and 1.2σ. Should the signiﬁcance of this excess increase with
more accumulated data, it would indicate the existence of New Physics beyond the
Standard Model (SM). A simple explanation of the excess consists in the resonant
production of a (pseudo)scalar with an invariant mass of 750 GeV and a relatively
large branching ratio into the diphoton channel [3,4]. A production cross section times
diphoton branching ratio between 5 and 10 fb ﬁts the observed excess. However, the
diphoton signal might be in slight tension with LHC Run-I data [5] since no signiﬁcant
excess was reported in the 8 TeV searches by both collaborations [6–9].

Here, in order to ameliorate the tension between 8 and 13 TeV data, we consider a
scenario with a heavy messenger resulting in a more involved event topology [10–12].
In this framework, we assume a heavy pseudoscalar parent resonance φ2 decaying
into a pair of lighter 750 GeV pseudoscalar resonances φ1. No additional particles
seem to accompany the diphoton signal, since the events in the sideband and in the
signal region look very similar. Therefore, the decay modes of φ1 into visible particles
other than photons must be suppressed. The simplest solution is to assume that the
lighter resonance mainly decays into an invisible particle ψ. Depending on the model
assumptions, the largest observable ﬁnal state could possibly be γγψψ. Moreover, if
the relation between masses is approximately mφ2 ≈ 2mφ1, the lighter resonance would
be produced at rest, resulting in little net missing momentum.

The results of ATLAS favour a large width of the resonance, of about 45 GeV,
with a local signiﬁcance increasing up to 3.9σ under this assumption. Instead, CMS
slightly prefers scenarios with a narrow width. Should future results point to a large
width, a large branching ratio into invisible particles would allow to accommodate this
observation without invoking strongly interacting New Physics scenarios [13].

It is natural to identify the invisible particle ψ with the dark matter (DM) (see for in-
stance Ref. [14] for a non-exhaustive list of works on this topic). Among the plethora of
DM candidates present in the literature, a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP)

2

produced via thermal freeze-out is one of the most appealing (see e.g. [15]). The 750
GeV resonance would then be identiﬁed as a portal to the WIMP DM sector similar
to the well studied Higgs portal models [16].

In this work, we want to study the implications of the diphoton excess in a heavy
parent resonance scenario on the DM phenomenology, assuming that the lighter 750 GeV
resonance φ1 mediates the interactions of a Majorana spin- 1
2 DM particle ψ. Although
the interaction of (pseudo)scalars with the SM gauge bosons would typically require
new heavy states, here we consider a model independent approach, where we do not
specify precisely the heavy particle sector. Instead, we describe the interactions of both
the two pseudoscalars and the DM via eﬀective operators. We deﬁne a cutoﬀ scale Λφi,
where the heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out and in this way we assume
the results here derived to be valid for any speciﬁc ultraviolet (UV) completion with
the same degrees of freedom below Λφi. We consider speciﬁc patterns for the eﬀective
couplings of this “toy model” motivated by some realistic models. At this scope, we
study two generic scenarios: one where the coupling of the lightest pseudoscalar φ1 to
gluons is set to zero, and a second one where φ1 can couple to gluons as well as to the
electroweak (EW) gauge bosons. While we ﬁt both scenarios to the diphoton excess,
we also carefully check other LHC constraints including monojet and dijet searches
and jets plus Emiss
searches. Moreover, we investigate the DM phenomenology, taking
into account cosmological and astroparticle constraints arising from the relic density
abundance measured by the PLANCK satellite [17] as well as from indirect detection
(ID) searches with the Fermi-LAT satellite [18, 19].

T

The paper is organised as follows. In the next Section, we present a simple model
independent framework for the heavy parent resonance model. We ﬁt the model pa-
rameters to the diphoton excess scrutinising the compatibility with LHC constraints
in Section 3. We then address the DM phenomenology in Section 5, considering the
constraints from cosmology and astroparticle physics. Finally, we conclude with a brief
summary in the last Section.

2 Eﬀective Lagrangian for the diphoton excess and

the dark matter

We consider a simple extension of the SM with the addition of two SM gauge singlet
pseudoscalars φ1 and φ2. The kinetic and mass terms of both pseudoscalars are given

where mφ1 and mφ2 denote the masses of φ1 and φ2, respectively. We consider the
following hierarchy: 2 × mφ1 ≤ mφ2. The heavy resonance φ2 is coupled to the lighter
resonance via a simple parity violating trilinear interaction term:

Ltrilinear = λφ1φ1φ2 .

(2.2)

We assume that the couplings between both pseudoscalars and SM fermions via higher
dimensional operators can be neglected. φ1 and φ2 communicate with the SM sec-
tor via interactions with the SM gauge bosons parametrised by the following model
independent eﬀective couplings:

and SU (2)L gauge indices, respectively. The prefactors cφi
j are a priori free parameters
but they can be explicitly calculated once the UV completion is known. For instance,
the cφi

j could be interpreted as anomaly induced couplings [20].

However, the goal of this work is not to discuss a speciﬁc model with UV completion,
hence we do not give a thorough deﬁnition of the full particle spectrum beyond the
SM. Nevertheless, the choice of the coeﬃcients cannot be completely arbitrary either,
hence we will later consider two diﬀerent scenarios which can be motivated by some
underlying UV physics.

We want to conclude this Section with a discussion of our ﬁnal ingredient: the DM
sector. There exists a large number of DM scenarios and in this work, we consider a
hidden Majorana particle ψ 2. Its stability can be ensured by introducing a discrete
Z2 symmetry, i.e. only pairs of ψ’s couple to other particles,

1We always consider Λφi O(few TeV) in order to satisfy the eﬀective ﬁeld theory hypothesis.
2The discussion for a Dirac DM candidate is straightforward.

We assume that ψ only couples to the lighter pseudoscalar via a Yukawa-type interac-
tion with strength gψ:

LDM = i ¯ψ(/∂ − mψ)ψ + igψ

¯ψγ5ψφ1 .

(2.5)

Thus, the relic density abundance of the DM candidate is governed by the s-channel
exchange of φ1. It is diﬃcult to accommodate a resonance with a large width assuming
dominant couplings to visible particles, since strict limits exist on the SM decay modes
of heavy resonances. However, here we consider scenarios with mψ < 1
2mφ1 allowing for
invisible decays of φ1. Depending on the size of gψ, the branching ratio into DM pairs
can be sizeable. In principle, a very large invisible branching ratio allows for scenarios
with large widths for φ1 – Γ(φ1) ∼ O(10) GeV – as favoured by ATLAS diphoton
data.

3 The diphoton signal and LHC constraints

3.1 Heavy parent resonance

In this Section, we discuss how to accommodate a diphoton signature from a 750 GeV
resonance in our hierarchical framework. Our goal is to explain the excess as a result of
the decay of a heavy parent resonance. In this setup, we consider the production of a
pseudoscalar resonance which decays into a pair of 750 GeV resonances φ1 subsequently
decaying into SM gauge bosons as well as into DM. We expect the dominant diphoton
signal from the following process, shown in Fig. 1:

pp → φ2 → φ1φ1 → γγ + X ,

(3.6)

where X denotes either ψψ or SM gauge boson pairs.

In order to achieve a dominant indirect production, the direct production of an
s-channel resonance φ1 with an invariant mass of 750 GeV must be heavily suppressed.
The typical cross section for the φ1 resonant production is given by3:

σ(pp → φ1 → γγ) =

mφ1s

× Cgg × Γ(φ1 → gg) × Γ(φ1 → γγ)

(3.7)

3We consider dominant gluon fusion production. This applies to Scenario 2, where the coupling
of φ1 to gluons is non-vanishing. We have numerically checked that the additional contribution from
photon fusion is subdominant for our choices of the eﬀective couplings.

expressions for the partial decay widths Γ(φ1 → gg) and Γ(φ1 → γγ) can be found
in the Appendix, together with the other decay widths and the corresponding squared
matrix elements for both pseudoscalars. Moreover, Γφ1 denotes the total decay width
of φ1.

The numerical evaluation of Eq. (3.7) is straightforward. We show in Fig. 2 the ratio
of the Cgg evaluated at centre-of-mass energies of 13 TeV and 8 TeV as a function of the
resonance mass. The cross section increases by a factor of 5 for a 750 GeV resonance
while rising the center-of-mass energy from 8 to 13 TeV. An even stronger increase
in the production cross section can be gained for larger resonance masses and thus
the eﬀective accumulated data from Run-II can already be larger than Run-I for very
heavy resonances. As a result, a diphoton excess originating from a parent resonance
shows less tension between 8 and 13 TeV data as advertised in the Introduction.

In Fig. 3 we depict the contours of the production cross section times the diphoton
branching ratio of φ1 as well as the invisible branching ratio of φ1 in the (cφ1

cf. Eq. (2.3), assuming gψ = 0.1, mψ = 330 GeV, cφ1
2 = 0 and Λφ1 = 3 TeV. We can
already see that in order to suppress the direct resonant production of φ1, the product
1 × cφ1
3 has to be (cid:46) O(1× 10−4). Thus, although our numerical scans will cover larger
cφ1
ranges of values for these two parameters, we will discuss our results focusing on this

constraints

In what follows, we assume that φ1 is dominantly produced via Eq. (3.6). However,
as discussed in the Introduction, φ1 cannot decay dominantly into SM particles since
this hypothesis is experimentally disfavoured. As a consequence, we assume that the
largest branching ratio of φ1 is into pairs of DM particles ψ, i.e. we consider the case
where Γ(φ1 → ψψ) ∼ Γφ1. The additional beneﬁt from this assumption is that a large
invisible branching ratio further helps to suppress the signal from direct production of
the light pseudoscalar. In the following we ﬁx the branching ratio BR(φ1 → ψψ) =
0.9 (0.8) in Scenario 1 (2). With these assumptions, 81% (64%) of the pair produced
φ1 events decay invisibly, while 18% (32%) of the events decay into two SM gauge
bosons and missing transverse energy and the ﬁnal state with four SM gauge bosons
has a branching ratio of 1% (4%). Since the diﬀerential distributions of the diphoton
events have not been published so far, we will probe scenarios with diﬀerent spectra of
missing transverse energy and pT of the diphoton system (see also Ref. [22] for a detailed
discussion). If the mass splitting between φ2 and φ1 is minimised while allowing for
an on-shell decay of φ2 → φ1φ1, the kinetic energy release can be suppressed. For this
reason our benchmark points will approximately fulﬁl this relation between the masses
of the two pseudoscalar states:

mφ2 ≈ 2 mφ1 .

(3.8)

Under this condition, both φ1 are produced at rest in the φ2 frame and thus the net
transverse missing energy distribution is minimised in the γγψψ ﬁnal state. However,
the photon pair will still have non-vanishing transverse momentum. In addition, due
to initial state radiation, the diphoton pair can get an additional boost which could
give rise to a harder transverse momentum distribution of the diphoton system.

Since we do not ﬁx the branching ratio BR(φ2 → φ1φ1), a sizeable branching ratio
of φ2 into SM gauge bosons is possible. As a consequence, dijet [23–26] and diphoton
signatures from the heavy resonance φ2 could be observable and we have to check that
our scenarios do not violate experimental limits. Another set of constraints comes
from monojet and monophoton searches [27–29] and these are explicitly checked in our
Monte Carlo simulation as discussed later. Finally, for the decay chain where one of
the daughter φ1 decays to the DM, while the other to jets (perhaps with intermediate
gauge bosons) the jets plus missing transverse energy search at 13 TeV [30] is also
applied.

4 Two scenarios for the diphoton excess

In the eﬀective Lagrangian of Eq. (2.3) there are six dimensionless couplings cφi
j which
are a priori free parameters. In this Section, we discuss two scenarios - see Table 1 -
where the eﬀective couplings can either be vanishing or they can be related as remi-
niscence of a more realistic and UV-complete model.

4.1 Numerical Tools

The full Lagrangian of Eqs. (2.1)–(2.5) was implemented using FeynRules 2.3.13 [31]
and an UFO output [32] was created for the numerical studies. We generated parton
level signal events with Madgraph 2.3.3 [33] interfaced with Pythia 6.4 [34] for the
parton shower, underlying event structure and hadronisation. We have implemented
the 8 and 13 TeV diphoton searches from ATLAS and CMS [1,2,6–9] into the CheckMATE

the fast detector simulation Delphes 3.10 [37] with heavily modiﬁed detector tunes
and it determines the number of expected signal events passing the selection cuts
of the particular analysis. The selection cuts for both ATLAS and CMS 13 TeV
diphoton analyses are shown in Table 2. The resulting signal eﬃciency varies between
20% and 60% depending on the signal region, the experiment and the centre-of-mass
energy. The analyses were validated to reproduce eﬃciencies reported by ATLAS and
CMS. Finally, experimental constraints from dijet searches, jets and missing transverse
momentum [30] and monojet [27–29] searches have been implemented into CheckMATE
1.2.2 and have been fully validated against public results.

4.2 Scenario 1

4.2.1 Benchmark Parameters

In this scenario we achieve dominant indirect production simply by setting the eﬀective
coupling between the gluons and φ1 to zero, cφ1
3 = 04. As a consequence, the lighter
pseudoscalar cannot be produced in gluon fusion and the production mechanism via
photon-photon collision is heavily suppressed. Hence, φ1 has to be produced in the
cascade decay of the heavy parent resonance. The solely allowed coupling between the
heavy resonance φ2 and the SM gauge bosons is to gluons. We ﬁx mφ2 = 1510 GeV
thus minimising the missing transverse momentum of the photon pair. Motivated by
the DM constraints, see Section 5, in the following we closely analyse a parameter point

4This choice of the eﬀective couplings seems arbitrary, but it resembles the structure of a hierar-

chical scenario in a simple composite Higgs model discussed in Ref. [38].

1 = 9.3 · 10−3 , gψ = 1.24 · 10−1 , mψ = 337 GeV .
cφ1

(4.9)

The other parameters are summarised in Table 1. The invisible branching ratio of the
light pseudoscalar is 90% while the one into photons is 0.7%. The lighter pseudoscalar
couples to the EW SM gauge bosons, namely W W , ZZ, Zγ and γγ states with the
following ratios of the partial decay widths of φ1:

γZ/γγ = 0.73, W W/γγ = 8.4, ZZ/γγ = 3.9 .

(4.10)

4.2.2 Constraints

Since the light pseudoscalar does not couple to gluons, its production cross section is
very small and does not aﬀect the phenomenology at the LHC. In particular, we do not
have to worry about diphoton constraints due to the gluon-initiated production. The
smallness of the BR(φ1 → γγ) further assures that the diphoton signal from photon-
photon fusion production of φ1 is also negligible. On the other hand, the couplings of
the light pseudoscalar are constrained by the astrophysical observables as we will see
in Section 5. As to the heavy pseudoscalar, whose coupling to gluons is non-vanishing,
one has to consider constraints coming from dijet spectra at mjj ∼ 1500 GeV in the 8
and 13 TeV data.

4.2.3 Results
In Fig. 4 we show the cross section contours for σ(pp → ψψγγ) for Scenario 1 with
mφ2 = 1510 GeV. The light blue shaded area is excluded by dijet searches [23–26].
The contours correspond to the cross sections of 3, 6, 9 fb for the production of the
diphoton ﬁnal state, which translates to ∼5, 10 and 15 events in the mass window
700–800 GeV. The simulated eﬃciency is ∼ 75% for ATLAS [1]. The diphotons have
relatively low momentum and are very central in the detector which results in a very
low contribution - consistent with the data - to the CMS EBEE [2] (ECAL barrel–end-
cap) signal region, 1.0, 2.1 and 3.3 events respectively. The yield in the barrel signal
region is similar to that of ATLAS.

In Fig. 5 we show the missing transverse energy distribution for diﬀerent heavy
scalar masses, mφ2 = 1510, 1600 and 1700 GeV. We can see that even for the mass

degenerate scenario, the net transverse missing energy is not negligible and the distri-
bution peaks around 100–150 GeV. As expected, once the mass gap between φ2 and
φ1 increases, the distribution shifts to the right. This distinctive feature can be used
to measure the mass of the heavy scalar once the signal is conﬁrmed and with higher
statistics (see also the detailed discussion in Ref. [22]).

4.3 Scenario 2

4.3.1 Benchmark parameters

In this scenario, we assume that all the eﬀective couplings cφi
in Eq. (2.3) are non-
j
vanishing. For simplicity, we ﬁx the relations between the various cφi
j as in scenario F1
of Ref. [12]. The authors introduced heavy vector-like fermions with the following SM
gauge group SU(3)C×SU(2)L×U(1)Y assignment: (3, 2, 7/6). The tree level decays of
the pseudoscalar into these new vector-like fermions are kinematically closed and thus
the pseudoscalar only decays into the SM gauge bosons via loop induced couplings as
well as into DM. We assume that the following parameters deﬁne the physics of the

4.3.2 Constraints

In this scenario where both scalars couple to gluons, the constraints from dijet searches [23–
26] and diphoton searches have to be taken into account for both invariant masses of
750 and 1600 GeV. However, the dominant branching ratio for both φ1 and φ2 is not the
one into jets. We have checked that for the above choice of parameters, Eq. (4.11), the
dijet constraints for φ1 are easily fulﬁlled. The situation is more tricky for the diphoton
ﬁnal state. In fact, since φ1 couples to gluons, direct production of the lighter resonance
φ1 is now possible and thus we have to check that the resonant production of φ1 is still
suppressed. We found that σ(pp → φ1 → γγ) (cid:39) 2 fb at
s = 13 TeV and one can
indeed expect ∼ 3 events in the signal region at 8 and 13 TeV.

Incidentally, there are two events in the ATLAS
search [1] at this invariant mass. The expected number of background events is ∼ 0.8
for mγγ > 1500 GeV. Since both events are located closely together one can speculate
that they originate from a hypothetical new particle and under this assumption the
local signiﬁcance is ∼ 3σ. This motivates our choice of mφ2 = 1600 GeV.5 In any
case, we also have to take into account the bound from CMS EBEB (ECAL barrel)
signal region, where no events were observed at mγγ = 1600 GeV. Since the diphotons
have the largest branching ratio from the EW gauge bosons, one clearly sees that
the constraints from other diboson production processes are easily fulﬁlled [39–41].
Nevertheless one could eventually expect to observe e.g. ZZ resonant production in
the 4-lepton channel.

4.3.3 Results
In Fig. 6 we present the cross section contours for σ(pp → ψψγγ) in Scenario 2. In the
shaded area, the resonant diphoton production via φ2 violates experimental bounds,
mainly from the CMS EBEB signal region. The red line corresponds to the expected
observation of 1.2 events at mγγ = 1600 GeV. The cross section contours 2.6, 3.9,
5.2 fb correspond to the expected 6, 9 and 12 events, respectively. As discussed in
the previous paragraph, the additional contribution of 3 events due to the resonant φ1
production would be expected. Similarly to Scenario 1, the diphotons have relatively
low momentum and are very central in the detector, which results in a very low contri-
bution, consistent with the data, to the CMS EBEE [2] signal region, 1.5, 2.3 and 3.1

the contribution due to φ2 is heavily shifted towards higher values, as already observed
in Scenario 1. This provides a unique feature of the model studied in this paper.

5 Dark Matter phenomenology

In this Section we discuss the possibility that the lightest pseudoscalar mediates the
interactions of a DM candidate – a Majorana fermion – with the SM. While several
aspects of the phenomenology of DM with a possible 750 GeV (pseudo)scalar mediator
have already been studied in the literature [14], we investigate the DM in a novel setup
and taking into account LHC constraints.

Within this framework, the DM particles ψ annihilate into SM particles via the s-
channel exchange of the pseudoscalar mediator φ1. The ﬁnal state particles which can
be produced in the annihilations are: ψψ → γγ, gg, γZ, ZZ and W +W − depending on
the couplings and on mψ. We compute the relic density of ψ using the code micrOMEGAs
4.1 [42], for which we have implemented our model in the CalcHEP format [43].

To address the phenomenology of DM in the parameter space allowed by our model,

we have performed a random scan with 10000 points over the parameters (mψ, cφi

branching ratio BR(φ1 → ψψ) = 90 (80) % in Scenario 1 (2). Fixing the BR(φ1 → ψψ)
leads to a relation between gψ and cφ1
1 . We have limited the DM mass up to mφ1/2, in
order to allow for invisible decays of φ1 as already discussed in Section 2.

Relic density

We compute the relic abundance of the DM as a function of its mass mψ and coupling
gψ. We apply the current constraints from the PLANCK satellite [17] with the best ﬁt
value of the relic density corresponding to Ωψh2 = (0.1198 ± 0.0026) [44]. We consider
a benchmark point consistent with the PLANCK bound, if the computed relic density
does not exceed the measured abundance. As a consequence, we regard under-abundant
DM as cosmologically safe although additional DM candidates have to be introduced
in the context of the standard cosmology.

Indirect detection

The observation of the ﬁnal products of DM annihilation is a promising method to
search for DM. In the scenarios considered here, φ1 does not couple to fermions,
therefore the possible contributions to the velocity averaged annihilation cross sec-
tion are: (cid:104)σv(cid:105)tot = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)γγ + (cid:104)σv(cid:105)W W + (cid:104)σv(cid:105)Zγ + (cid:104)σv(cid:105)ZZ in Scenario 1 and (cid:104)σv(cid:105)tot =
(cid:104)σv(cid:105)γγ + (cid:104)σv(cid:105)Zγ + (cid:104)σv(cid:105)ZZ + (cid:104)σv(cid:105)gg in Scenario 2.

Among all possible SM particles which can be produced by DM annihilation, pho-
tons are among the most powerful messengers for the ID of DM, since they proceed
almost unperturbed when propagating through the Universe. γ-rays from DM annihi-
lation can be produced via a variety of mechanisms. Here we have two diﬀerent γ-ray
signatures. Firstly, the DM annihilation into the SM gauge bosons, ψψ → ZZ, Zγ,
W +W − and gg which eventually hadronise and/or decay producing lighter mesons (π)
that give rise to a continuous spectrum. Secondly, both our scenarios are characterised
(owing to the connection to the diphoton signal at the LHC) by the presence of a
monochromatic γ-ray signal at mψ. Since no DM signal has been found so far by ID
experiments, we apply the latest bounds from the Fermi-LAT collaboration on the DM
annihilation cross sections [18, 19].

In order to compare with the experimental bounds from ID, we rescale the DM
annihilation cross section taking into account the ratio of the value of the relic density

17

computed in our scenarios and the observed one. We impose the limits on the contin-
uous spectrum from the latest observation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) of the
Milky Way made by Fermi-LAT [18]. For Scenario 1, we compare the experimental
bounds from he W +W − ﬁnal state provided by Fermi-LAT [18] with our predicted
annihilation cross section (cid:104)σv(cid:105)ZZ + (cid:104)σv(cid:105)W +W − +
. In Scenario 2 we compare the
experimental bounds for the u¯u channel obtained by the Fermi-LAT collaboration [18]
with our predicted annihilation cross section (cid:104)σv(cid:105)gg

We further consider the limits on the annihilation cross section from Galactic γ-ray
line searches from Fermi-LAT. In this case, we compare the experimental bounds from
Ref. [19] with the predicted annihilation cross section (cid:104)σv(cid:105)γγ +
. We consider the
limits given by the Fermi-LAT collaboration, both assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White
(NFW) proﬁle and an Einasto proﬁle of the spatial distribution of DM in our Galaxy.

Direct detection

The limits from direct searches for DM are not relevant in the case of a pseudoscalar
mediator. The DM-nucleons scattering cross-section is indeed strongly suppressed by
the square of the nuclear recoil energy, which is small because of the non-relativistic
nature of the interaction (see for instance the discussion in [45]). Therefore we do not
discuss bounds from direct detection experiments.

Numerical results

The results of the numerical scan for Scenario 1 are shown in Fig. 8 in the (mψ, gψ)

plane. In this scenario, we have ﬁxed cφ1
TeV, as described in Section 3 (see Table 1). We depict as grey points the solutions
with Ωψh2 >∼ 0.1198, hence excluded by the relic density measurement made by the
PLANCK satellite [17]. The solutions lying on the red curve have the relic density
Ωψh2 ∼ (0.1198±2σ) while the blue points correspond to under-abundant DM (Ωψh2 (cid:46)
0.1198) and are in agreement with ID bounds. Yellow (yellow + orange) points are
excluded by γ-ray line searches [19] assuming a NFW (Einasto) proﬁle of the spatial
distribution of the DM in our Galaxy. The γ-ray line constraints also apply to the
points along the red line close to the yellow region. Finally, the brown curves denote

the direct resonant production of φ1 followed by the decay to a photon pair. This
has to be combined with the non-direct production to obtain a meaningful limit, as
detailed in Section 3. For guidance we show the purple dashed line corresponding to
σ(pp → φ1 → γγ) = 1 fb.

In both scenarios, the constraint on the relic abundance of ψ sets a lower limit on
mψ: for mψ (cid:46) 150 (120) GeV, gψ approaches the non-perturbative regime. Indeed,
when mψ is light, far from the resonance, large values of the coupling gψ are required in
order to match the correct relic abundance. On the other hand, light DM masses allow
for a larger total decay width Γφ1. Nonetheless, Γφ1 as large as ∼ 45–60 GeV turns out
to be disfavoured by ID constraints, mainly γ-ray line searches with the Fermi-LAT
satellite. These bounds can be relaxed considering a more conservative DM density
distribution thus allowing for a small region of the parameter space with mψ ∼ 200
GeV where Γφ1 ∼ 45 GeV and ψ is under-abundant. When mψ approaches the value
mφ1/2, the annihilation cross section gets enhanced and allowed values of the relic
density Ωψh2 (cid:46) 0.1198 are achieved with smaller values of gψ, as low as ∼ 10−2(10−3)
in Scenario 1 (2).

The ID γ-ray bounds mainly constrain DM masses mψ (cid:46) 300 GeV and values of the
coupling gψ >∼ 0.2. The bounds from dSphs turn out to be not relevant in this scenarios
for perturbative values of gψ, while searches for γ-ray lines give stronger constraints.
The relative strength of these bounds is determined by the relative ratios of the eﬀective
couplings cφ1
j . A larger region of the parameter space of both scenarios can be further
probed with both γ-ray lines and dSphs searches by the Fermi-LAT collaboration in
the immediate future, by accumulating more data.

A modest excess in the diphoton channel at the invariant mass of about 750 GeV has
been reported by both ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC. Motivated by
this recent observation, we have considered a model with a heavy parent pseudoscalar
decaying into a pair of 750 GeV pseudoscalar resonances.

This hierarchical framework improves the agreement between 8 and 13 TeV data
on the resonant production of the 750 GeV (pseudo)scalar. Moreover, since no addi-
tional SM particles seem to accompany to the diphoton signal, we have addressed the
possibility for the lighter resonance to decay dominantly into invisible particles, which
can play the rˆole of the DM in the Universe. In this setup, the annihilation of DM into
SM particles proceeds via an s-channel exchange of the lighter pseudoscalar. We have
examined the implications of the diphoton signal on the DM phenomenology, taking
into account an array of constraints, both from LHC and from astroparticle physics.
We have conducted our analysis with an eﬀective theory approach, assuming that the
DM is a Majorana fermion and considering two representative scenarios with speciﬁc
patterns for the eﬀective couplings.

We have ﬁtted the model to the diphoton excess and we have imposed constraints
from mono-X (X=jet or photon), dijet and jets plus Emiss
searches. Concerning
the DM, we have required compatibility with the relic abundance determined by the
PLANCK satellite and with indirect detection constraints from the Fermi-LAT satel-
lite, namely searches for γ-ray lines from DM annihilation in our Galaxy and for γ-rays
from DM annihilation in dSphs.

T

We have found that the relic density constraint together with the requirement of
perturbativity of the couplings, impose an upper bound on the DM mass (cid:38) 150 GeV
(120) GeV for Scenario 1 (2). ID bounds further constrain the parameter space, for DM
masses (cid:46) 300 GeV and values of the coupling gψ (cid:38) 0.2. The astroparticle constraints
turn out to disfavour a large decay width of the light resonance ∼ 45-60 GeV.

Finally, further constraints imposed using the LHC data and the production of
