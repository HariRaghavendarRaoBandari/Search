Abstract

Mathematical models are often regarded as recent innovations in the
description and analysis of infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics, but
simple models have been in use for projection of epidemic trajectories for
more than a century. We recently described a single equation model (the
incidence decay with exponential adjustment, or IDEA, model) that can
be used for short term forecasting. In the mid-19th century, Dr. William
Farr developed a single equation approach (“Farr’s law”) for epidemic fore-
casting. We show here that the two models are in fact identical, and can
be expressed in terms of one another, and also in terms of a susceptible-
infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental model with improving control.
This demonstrates that the concept of the reproduction number (R0) is
implicit to Farr’s (pre-microbial era) work, and also suggests that control
of epidemics, whether via behavior change or intervention, is as integral to
the natural history of epidemics as is the dynamics of disease transmission.

Introduction

The control of communicable diseases is an endeavor that has witnessed re-
markable successes over the past century; diseases that previously caused large
scale mortality have been eradicated [1, 2], locally eliminated [3], or have been
markedly reduced in incidence globally as a result of vaccination, antimicro-
bial therapy, water and sewage treatment, and advances in food safety [4–6].
Nonetheless, the threat of communicable diseases persists; emerging infectious
diseases continue to be identiﬁed, often in association with changes in human
and animal mobility, agricultural practices, environmental degradation, and mis-
use of antimicrobial therapy [7–9]. Recent outbreaks or epidemics associated
with MERS coronavirus [10], inﬂuenza A(H7N9) [11], and the West African
emergence of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus [12], have challenged epidemiolo-
gists as the natural history, modes of transmission, and/or means of control of

1

these diseases have not been well understood during initial periods of emergence.

When novel infectious diseases emerge or familiar diseases resurge, mathematical
models can serve as useful tools for the synthesis of available data, management
of uncertainty, and projection of likely epidemic trajectories [13]. While it may
be challenging to parameterize detailed mechanistic mathematical models when
there is little information on mechanisms of transmission, baseline immunity
in a community, the nature of the infecting pathogen, et cetera, a number of
descriptive approaches exist which may permit ﬁtting, and forecasting, of an
epidemic curve. One single equation approach that has been applied to emerg-
ing infections is the Richards model, which treats cumulative infections as a
logistic growth process [14]. However, the concept of modeling an epidemic
curve as a simple function, without reference to mechanisms of transmission,
is in fact much older, and may originate in the work of the English polymath
Dr. William Farr (1807-1883), who rose from humble beginnings to become a
physician, mathematician, hygienist and protege of Lancet founder Dr. Thomas
Wakley [15–17]. Dr. Farr spent almost 40 years at the General Register Oﬃce
of the United Kingdom, and the esteem in which he was held is apparent in the
”letters” he published annually as appendices to the reports of the Registrar
General, in which he supplemented the dry statistical reports with thoughtful
and creative musings on topics as wide-ranging as the relationships between
occupation and disease, suicide and mortality in the mentally ill, population
density and mortality, and as above the ”laws” governing epidemics [18].

Using what was subsequently dubbed ”Farr’s law” [17, 19], Farr used the ra-
tio of case counts in successive time periods to successfully forecast the size and
duration of epidemics of smallpox and rinderpest [16,17] (Figure 1). Farr demon-
strated in a ”letter” of 1837 that the decline of a national smallpox epidemic was
exponential rather than linear [18]. He used related methods over 25 years later,
to refute the assertion by a British parliamentarian that a rinderpest epidemic
in British cattle would continue to grow exponentially over time [16,17]. Again,
Farr demonstrated that although case numbers were increasing markedly, the
rate of increase was, in fact, decelerating; he asserted that the epidemic would
be large but would end in the coming months, a projection which proved to be
correct.

Farr was famously vague about the mathematical underpinnings of his pro-
jections, though key to his observation was the observation that case counts
would decrease by a constant log-quantity following initial exponential epidemic
growth [16]. It fell to other contemporaries [26] and later epidemiologists (most
notably Dr. John Brownlee) to formalize ”Farr’s law” [15, 27, 28]. (It should
be noted that the term ”Farr’s law” is ambiguous. Farr himself referred to a
”law” in his letter on rinderpest [16], but the term has also been used by others
to describe Farr’s observations on the relation between population density and
death [20], and to his description of the relationship between cholera mortality
and altitude [21]. In his elaboration of the ”law”, Brownlee referred to it as
”Farr’s theory of epidemics” [16]).

2

We recently proposed a descriptive approach to the initial estimation of the basic
reproduction number (R0) of an emerging or re-emerging pathogen, which also
provides information on the rate at which the process is being controlled, as well
as reasonable short-term projections of incidence. This two-parameter model,
which we have referred to as the “Incidence Decay with Exponential Adjust-
ment” (IDEA) model, oﬀers advantages of simplicity, explicit linkage to theory
of epidemic growth, and also acknowledges the fact that epidemics and outbreaks
do not peak and end simply due to depletion of susceptibles, but because of a
complex constellation of public health actions and behavioral changes that may
modify the course of an epidemic and reduce the eﬀective reproductive number
Re(t) of an outbreak [22]. One of us (PF) had previously written about Farr’s
rule and its importance in the development of epidemic theory [15], and noted
the conceptual similarity between IDEA and Farr’s rule. Upon exploration of
these two approaches we realized that they are, notwithstanding having been
formulated some 160 years apart, and being based on very diﬀerent theoretical
constructs, identical. Here we demonstrate the equivalence of these methods
for epidemic modeling and forecasting, and explore the potential advantages of
using these methodologies to complement other approaches. We explore nu-
merical examples derived from current emerging infectious diseases, including
the West African Ebola virus outbreak. We show that these methodologies
work fairly well in a number of cases, and discuss what this fact implies about
diﬃcult-to-measure components of transmission and control parameters.

2 Methods

2.1 Farr’s Rule

The empirical relationship between observed cases of infected individuals, in
sequential time intervals, during an epidemic outbreak according to Farr’s rule
is given by

I(t + 3)
I(t + 2)
I(t + 1)

I(t)

= K

(1)

where I(t) represents the number of observed newly infected individuals at time
t, and K is a constant. For values of K < 1, the rate of change in the ob-
served cases (acceleration) decreases as time evolves, and the family of curves
I(t) that satisfy equation (1) correspond to familiar bell-shaped epidemiological
curves.

The rule was investigated and elaborated upon by the epidemiologist John
Brownlee who noted that I(t) under this rule would correspond to the function
[15]

exp(−At2 + Bt + C)

(2)

3

where A, B, and C are constants. Of note, Brownlee’s formulation identiﬁes a
process where cases increase as a ﬁrst order process, but decrease as a second
order process, as is the case with the IDEA model.

2.2

IDEA Model

In its basic form the IDEA model holds

(cid:18) R0

(cid:19)t

(3)

I(t) =

(1 + d)t

where I(t) is the incident infections in generation t of an outbreak (thus t =
{1, 2, 3, ...} ∈ N). This is in contradistinction to equation (1) above where t is
an arbitrary, but constant, time interval (not necessarily equal to a generation
interval). The parameter R0 is the basic reproduction number as usually de-
ﬁned; that is, the number of secondary cases created by a primary case in a
totally susceptible population and in the absence of intervention. The param-
eter d which we have referred to as a “control parameter” deﬁnes the rate at
which transmission declines over the course of an epidemic. The empirical un-
derpinnings of d are not yet well deﬁned, but based on current understanding of
disease dynamics could represent public health interventions, population adap-
tation or behavior change, improved availability of personal protective items or
eﬀect of drugs to treat infection, or reductions in population susceptibility as a
result of infection or vaccination. As noted above, by ﬁtting the model to data
we have previously obtained reasonable estimates of R0 early in the course of
epidemics, and have also been able to produce plausible near-term projections
of future case counts.

2.3 Diﬀerence Equation Susceptible-Infectious-Removed

Model

In an earlier publication we commented on the almost identical projections gen-
erated by IDEA and a compartmental diﬀerence equation (Susceptible-Infectious-
Removed, or SIR) [22], when R0 is small and when there is exponential reduction
in risk over time. Indeed, the eﬀect we identiﬁed can be generalized to any situa-
tion where depletion of susceptibles due to infection is small relative to the total
population size, and not only when R0 is small. We used a “damped” version
of the standard SIR model whose formulation in generation interval time scale
is given by:

St+1 = St − Re(t)It
It+1 = Re(t)It

(4)

(5)
with St the number of susceptible individuals at time t and Re(t) the eﬀective
reproductive number at time t deﬁned by:

Re(t) = R0

St
N

ρt

4

(6)

The “dampening” parameter ρ represents the relative risk of infection in each
generation of the epidemic, compared to risk seen in the last generation (i.e.,
if there were no improvement in control in a given generation compared to the
last, most recent generation).
If an outbreak is small relative to the size of
the total population (as would be true if R0 were modest and control achieved
relatively quickly) S(t)/N will be approximately 1 throughout the outbreak and
the expression can be rewritten as:

(cid:89)

I(t) = I(0)

(ρsR0)

(7)

s<t

meaning that all reduction in Re(t) is due to control rather than depletion
of susceptibles. R0 is a constant, and the sum of exponents of ρ is simply
t(t + 1)/2. We can assume (as we do with IDEA) that the outbreak began with
the introduction of a single case such that I(0) = 1. Now:

I(t) = ρt(t+1)/2Rt

0

(8)

2.4 Numerical Examples using Recent Outbreak Data

We have used IDEA to explore the nature of epidemic growth during the recent
West African Ebola epidemic [31, 32], the 2014 MERS coronavirus outbreak in
Saudi Arabia [33], and more recently Chikungunya virus invasion in the Western
hemisphere [34]. As publicly available data have taken the form of cumulative
incidence curves (with absent dates of onset) we ﬁt IDEA to cumulative curves,
but it is possible to estimate ”pseudo-incidence” by taking the interval to interval
diﬀerence cumulative incidence over time.

We ﬁt IDEA to the incidence time series and calculated Farr’s K for sequential
generation tetrads, and converted K values to the d parameter in IDEA using
the relation K = 1
(1+d)4 described below. Of necessity, we excluded K estimates
derived from sequences of intervals containing negative incidence estimates (i.e.,
those where reported cumulative incidence declined). Data sources used for
these analyses are available at
http://ﬁgshare.com/authors/Tahmina Nasserie/686527(Chikungunya) and
https://github.com/cmrivers/ebola (Ebola).

3 Results

3.1 Equivalence of IDEA and Farr’s Rule

An incidence curve described by IDEA naturally satisﬁes Farr’s rule. Indeed,
substituting (3) into (1) gives

(9)
It is interesting to note that the value of R0 in the IDEA model is irrelevant in
the proof (see Appendix 5.1).

B = log R0 and C = 0.

3.2 K as an Odds Ratio

It

It+1

As K represents a ratio of ratios, it can be conceptualized as equivalent in form
to an odds ratio. Eﬀectively,
is the odds of a case occurring in an initial
as opposed to a subsequent generation while K then becomes interpretable as
an odds ratio, though it is unclear whether this odds ratio has an intuitive
meaning. Nonetheless, this form is important as it suggests that the asymptotic
variance of log(K) can be estimated as ( 1
) [35]. Estimation
It
of variance of log(K) makes it possible to estimate conﬁdence limits for K, and
thus for d. Furthermore, given that several K estimates can be generated from
a given epidemic curve, estimation of variance should permit the use of Mantel-
Haenszel methods [37] to generate summary estimates of K over the course of
an epidemic, or to use meta-regressive methods to evaluate K for trends [36].
A potential pitfall here is the non-independence of serial estimates of K due to
overlap in incidence values used in adjacent estimates of K.

3.3 Relation of SIR Model to Farr’s K and IDEA

When the depletion of susceptible is negligible compared to the total popu-
lation size (that is, a small outbreak), we can actually express IDEA’s basic
reproductive number R0,IDEA and its control factor d as a function of the basic
reproductive number R0,SIR and the control factor ρ of the damped SIR model
described in (4-6). The relationship between the parameters of these two models
is (details in Appendix 5.2)

R0,IDEA (cid:39) R0,SIR√

(11)

(12)

Substituting (12) in equation (9) we can link Farr’s rule with the damped SIR
model:

K (cid:39) ρ2

(13)

3.4 Numerical Simulations

In this section, we aim to test numerically the validity of approximations (11)
and (12). In particular, given a damped SIR model, we explore the parameter

6

space R0,SIR and ρ for which these approximations hold. Note that the link
between IDEA and Farr’s rule given by equation (9) is not an approximation, but
a genuine equality (subject to the time step used in Farr’s rule being equivalent
to one generation), so there is no need to test it numerically. To measure
the performance of the approximation, we consider the distance between the
simulated incidence time series. Let N be the number of generations simulated
and ISIR(k) (resp. IIDEA(k)) the incidence from the SIR (resp IDEA) model
at the kth generation, we deﬁne their distance by

(cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:116) N(cid:88)

δ =

(ISIR(k) − IIDEA(k))2

(14)

k=1

The tests are implemented in the software R [39] and code is available in elec-
tronic supplement ﬁles. Figure 3 shows the values of the distance δ for diﬀerent
values of R0,SIR and ρ. We see that for a combination of R0,SIR and ρ such that
the depletion of susceptible is not too large, the approximation is very good.
But when the values of R0,SIR and ρ generate a depletion of susceptible indi-
viduals that is no longer negligible (white area in Figure 3), then the incidence
curve from the IDEA model diverges from that generated by the damped SIR
model.

3.5 Application: Ebola and Chikungunya

Considering real epidemic data from Ebola and Chinkungunya, it can be seen
that the interval to interval variability in K was substantial, likely reﬂecting
variability in reporting (Figure 5 and Figure 6). Simple arithmetic means of
K over time were also unstable due to skewing by values substantially greater
than 1. However, when we estimated the geometric mean of K over time we
found that the resultant d estimate approximated that derived through ﬁtting
IDEA.

Furthermore, we noted that in the Chikungunya time series there was a large
perturbation in best-ﬁt values of d occurring in October 2014, corresponding
with an apparent multi-wave epidemic. We have previously noted that this
abrupt change the generation-to-generation best ﬁt value of d corresponds with
the occurrence of multiwave epidemics when IDEA is ﬁt to simulated data [22];
using Farr’s approach, the onset of a possible new Chikungunya wave seems to
correspond with an abrupt increase in K to a value far greater than one (Figure
7). The utility of large values of K as a signal of an incipient epidemic wave
warrants further investigation.

4 Discussion

Although the real-time application of mathematical modeling to understanding
and control of outbreaks is often perceived as representing a recent development
in infectious disease epidemiology [23], disease modeling has deeper historical

7

roots, including work by Bernoulli on smallpox in the 18th century [24]; work
by Ross on malaria transmission [25], and as mentioned above, Farr’s work on
the growth and cessation of epidemics [15, 16, 27]. We had published a simple,
phenomenological approach to the description and projection of outbreaks and
epidemics [22] which we had initially regarded as a novel formulation rooted in
the concept of the basic reproduction number R0.
In that work, we demonstrated concordance with projections derived using a
3-compartment diﬀerence equation model (damped SIR model). We have subse-
quently realized, and demonstrate above, that our approach simply represented
a restatement of Farr’s work, albeit in a manner that is tied to the concept of R0.
According to Brownlee, Farr promised to describe the derivation of his model
in greater detail in future reports, but never did so [16], and much of the math-
ematical elaboration of Farr’s work was in fact done by Brownlee after Farr’s
death [27]. Nonetheless, Brownlee notes that to Farr, the predictive accuracy
of his approach reﬂected three characteristics of epidemics, according to Farr’s
(pre-microbial) understanding: (i) diminution in the number of susceptibles
over time due to recovery from infection (“immunity”, though to use this term
in application to Farr is an anachronism); (ii) diminished population density
due to death from infection; and (iii) diminishing pathogenicity of the disease
with each passing generation of infection as a result of (to quote Farr) ”[loss
of] part of the force of infection in every body through which they pass...the
matter...diminishes in strength at every transmission by innoculation” [16]. The
ﬁrst two characteristics are not incompatible with the current understanding of
epidemic dynamics, whereas the third is not (though it does anticipate more
modern ideas around evolution of virulence and disease ecology [29, 30]).

However, as this model is phenomenological, rather than mechanistic in nature,
the putative epidemiological mechanisms underlying model performance are not
of immediate importance. Indeed, while the simplicity of this approach may be
regarded as a limitation, the simplicity of the form, and its implicit incorporation
of biological, social, medical, and behavioral drivers of control into a single
parameter estimated via ﬁtting, may be a strength, especially given that such
control factors as behavior change due to fear may be diﬃcult or impossible to
measure in real time.

When we have applied IDEA to current day outbreaks and epidemics, we have
remained agnostic about the factors that cause second order deceleration of epi-
demic growth. Referring to ﬁrst principles, the components of a reproduction
number are duration of infectiousness, contact rate, and probability of trans-
mission conditional on contact, as well as susceptibility in a population [38].
We presume that public health interventions, population behavior change (as a
result of education or rumours, prudence or fear), and the occurrence of silent
infections with immunity could all contribute to deceleration of epidemic spread,
even when the eﬀective reproductive number is expected to be greater than 1
due to widespread susceptibility in the population. Furthermore, we note that
Farr’s original ”time step” appears to have been arbitrary (reﬂecting the form
of data available to him: weekly for rinderpest, quarterly for smallpox), whereas
we have used generations as time steps in our more recent applications of Farr’s
”law”, and in IDEA and SIR models. This potential discrepancy between Farr’s
initial eﬀorts and our more recent eﬀorts warrants further exploration.

4.1 Summary

In demonstrating that the IDEA model and Farr’s model are mathematically
identical (and can be virtually identical to an SIR model with a small R0, abun-
dant susceptibility in the population, and exponential improvement in control)
we demonstrate that recognizing the underlying mechanism of epidemic con-
trol may be unimportant for generating reasonable forecasts of epidemics with
control, or recognizing when their fundamental dynamics have changed. Our
contribution in the current work is to show that Farr’s law, while derived in
the pre-microbial era, can be reformulated in terms of the concept of the basic
reproductive number, combined with exponential increase in control via what-
ever mechanism. We observe, unexpectedly, that Farr’s K can be expressed as a
function of the IDEA d parameter alone, independent of R0, implying that epi-
demic trajectory is (and has historically been) more a function of control eﬀorts
and changing behavior than of the fundamental characteristics of a given infec-
tious disease. Whether or not the ratio K can have stand-alone value as a tool
to identify unexpected shifts in epidemic trajectory (e.g., the two wave epidemic
of Chikungunya referred to in Figure 7 above) will be the subject of future work.

Assume that the parameters R0 and d ≥ 0, in the IDEA model, describe accu-
rately the observed number of infected cases as a function of (serial) time, in
an ideal outbreak. Then we can substitute I(t) from equation (3) into equation
(1) to see if the sequential number of infected individuals, as predicted by the
IDEA model, satisfy Farr’s law.

the recent West African Ebola outbreak. Approximate date of the last genera-
tion incorporated into estimates is plotted on the X-axis; estimated d is plotted
on the Y-axis. d estimates were either derived via IDEA model ﬁtting to “in-
cident” cases (blue diamonds) or cumulative incidence (crosses), or derived by
estimating Farr’s K and transforming resultant estimates using the relation de-
scribed by equation (9). When K is estimated using 4-generation series (green
diamonds), resultant d estimates are volatile and bear little resemblance to d
estimates derived through ﬁtting IDEA. However, estimates of K derived as ge-
ometric means of all available K values (red squares) provide a more reasonable
approximation of d.

Figure 6: As with Figure 5, this ﬁgure shows estimates of d, derived directly
by model ﬁtting or by transforming estimates of Farr’s K, for the emerging
Western Hemisphere Chikungunya epidemic in 2014-2015. As in Figure 5, d
estimates were either derived via IDEA model ﬁtting to “incident” cases (blue
diamonds) or cumulative incidence (crosses), or derived by estimating Farr’s K
and transforming resultant estimates. As in Figure 5, volatile estimates of K
were derived using 4-generation series (green diamonds), but estimates of K
derived as geometric means of all available K values (red squares) provided a
reasonable approximation of d.

Figure 7: A possible application for raw estimates of Farr’s K emerged in anal-
ysis of data from the 2014-2015 Western Hemisphere Chikungunya outbreak;
here it appears that a multi-wave epidemic is signaled by a sudden surge in K
to a value > 1 (red line), indicating that there is renewed exponential growth
in cases (blue bars), rather than exponential decline. X-axis, date of most re-
cent generation; left Y-axis, Farr’s K; right Y-axis, estimated per-generation
Chikungunya case count and transforming resultant estimates. As in Figure 1,
volatile estimates of K were derived using 4-generation series (green diamonds),
but estimates of K derived as geometric means of all available K values (red
squares) provided a reasonable approximation of d.
