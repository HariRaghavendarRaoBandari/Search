We analyze experimentally and theoretically the spatio-temporal dynamics of a highly multimode
semiconductor laser with coherent optical injection. Due to the particular geometry of the device (a
1 m long ring cavity), the multimode dynamics can be resolved in real time and we observe stable
chiral solitons and domain dynamics. The experiment is analyzed in the framework of a set of
eﬀective semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch equations. We analyze the stability of stationary solutions
and simulate both the complete model and a reduced rate equation model. This allows us to predict
domain shrinking and the stability of only one chiral charge that we ascribe to the ﬁnite active
medium response time.

INTRODUCTION

Optical systems are often used as an experimental test
bench for the analysis of complex dynamical phenom-
ena.
In the context of laser physics, many such stud-
ies have been devoted to the laser with injected signal
[1, 2]. This interest can be attributed to the fact that
the forcing term breaks the phase symmetry of the laser
system. Doing so, it increases by one the number of
dimensions of the phase space [3], and therefore brings
the very common singlemode class-B lasers (semiconduc-
tor, CO2, most solid-state) from bidimensional to three-
dimensional, thus allowing chaotic dynamics. Because
of their relative experimental ease of use and theoreti-
cal convenience, lasers with injected signal are therefore
a widely explored topic whose study remains very lively
on speciﬁc topics like optical excitability [4–7]. However,
most works to date have remained limited to single mode
dynamics with comparatively few works focussed on ei-
ther in transverse [8] or longitudinal [9–11] spatiotem-
poral dynamics. Yet, multimode or spatially extended
lasers with coherent forcing can be an extraordinary tool
to explore synchronization and dynamics of oscillatory
media with forcing, a conceptually simple yet very rich
dynamical context [12–14].

Here, following the recent observation of phase solitons
hosting a chiral charge and deeply related to excitable
dynamics [15], we describe experimental observations of
the spatio-temporal behavior of a strongly multimode
semiconductor ring laser with optical
forcing. We
evidence plane-wave and modulational instabilities and
show the propagation of fronts. In order to explain these
new experimental ﬁndings we derive a set of eﬀective
semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch equations and analyze
the stability of injection locked solutions with an exact
and an approximated approach. The model is further

reduced to a set of rate-equations which reproduce well
the basic features of the relevant dynamical regimes and
of the phase solitons, at diﬀerence from the Ginzburg-
Landau derived in [15] which assumes instantaneous gain.

In section II we present the experimental device (II A)
followed by spectral analysis of the dynamics (II B). We
then describe diﬀerent instabilities (II C) and analyze the
propagation of solitons and fronts (II D). The theoretical
analysis is reported in section III, where we ﬁrst derive
a set of eﬀective semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch equations
(III A) and their reduction to rate-equations (III B). We
then analyze the injection locked solution and its stability
(III C) and describe the results of numerical simulations
(III D). Finally, we present our conclusions in section IV

II. EXPERIMENT

A. Experimental setup

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. It consists
of a highly multimode semiconductor ring laser with ex-
ternal forcing. The ring laser is built by enclosing a 4 mm
long, 980 nm, semiconductor optical ampliﬁer inside a
ring cavity. The direction of the junction is horizontal
(ie the largest transverse direction of the gain stripe is
vertical). Due to the geometry of the gain stripe, the
output beam of the optical ampliﬁer is very astigmatic.
At diﬀerence from standard operation of optical am-
pliﬁers, the present ampliﬁer being operated in a laser
with injected signal conﬁguration requires very careful
stabilization of temperature in order to keep the laser
wavelength emission constant with respect to the exter-
nal forcing. This is here achieved by two Peltier ele-
ments operating in parallel and with separate heat sinks.
One of the Peltier elements provides the bulk of heat
removal and is operated at constant current, while the
other one is operated in a standard proportional-integral-
derivative scheme for high-sensitivity active stabilization.

FIG. 1: Left: Scheme of the experimental setup. The semi-
conductor element SE is enclosed in a unidirectional ring cav-
ity, which includes two beam splitters on of which is used for
signal pick-up and the other one for external forcing. Cylin-
drical lenses CL are used to compensate for the very strong
astigmatism of the beam caused by the aperture of the semi-
conductor element. FPD1-2 are high bandwidth (9 GHz) pho-
todetectors used for time series (oscilloscope) and power spec-
trum (PSA) measurements. Detector D1 is used to monitor
slow dynamics (micro to millisecond) associated to thermal
eﬀects. The optical spectrum analyzer is used for coarse tun-
ing of the forcing beam close to the ring laser frequency. The
tunable master laser spectrum is monitored by a Fabry-Perot
interferometer and part of the forcing beam is sent to a ﬁber
coupler for beat note or phase measurements.

The highly diverging direction is collimated on each side
with high numerical aperture spherical collimators and
the remaining divergence along the other direction (verti-
cal) is then compensated for by a set of cylindrical lenses.
The ring cavity is eight-shaped because it allows for lower
incidence angle of the beam on the cavity mirrors. The
laser is kept unidirectional by an optical isolator placed
at the opposite side of the cavity with respect to the
gain medium. The former, combined with the cylindrical
lenses, has the additional eﬀect of ﬁltering out unwanted
transverse eﬀects [16] by constraining emission on a sin-
gle transverse mode. The ring cavity itself is constituted
by three high reﬂectivity mirrors (R>99%) and one 90%
reﬂectivity beamsplitter used as an input for the forcing
beam. One of the mirrors (bottom right in Fig. 1) is
mounted on a piezoelectric actuator which allows sub-
wavelength tuning of the cavity length. An additional
10% reﬂectivity outcoupling beam splitter is inserted in
the cavity for the detection path since the other available
output (at the 90% beamsplitter) is unusable due to very
strong direct reﬂection of the forcing beam which brings
the detectors to saturation. The roundtrip time is about
3.6 ns and the measured ﬁeld lifetime is of the order of
10ns. This means a very low ﬁnesse (less than 10) of
the cavity as compared to the value which could be es-
timated from the beam splitter and mirror reﬂectivities,
which we attribute to poor mode matching (somewhat
unavoidable with strongly astigmatic beams).

The output of the laser is measured in the direction of

FIG. 2: Transmission of the ring cavity as a function of the
detuning between the master laser and the resonances of the
ring cavity, obtained for diﬀerent values of injected power.

the injection beam. The output beam is split in several
parts, used for low bandwidth (but high sensitivity) emit-
ted power measurement, optical spectrum measurement
and high bandwidth (9 GHz) time-series or power spec-
trum measurement. The ﬁrst two detection paths are
used to optimize the ring laser alignment by minimizing
standalone lasing threshold and to ensure proper tuning
of the injection beam with respect to the ring laser. The
emitted power in the operating regime (about 1.1 times
the threshold current) is of the order of 10 mW.

The injection beam is provided by a grating tunable
external cavity semiconductor laser followed by an opti-
cal ampliﬁer providing about 200 mW optical power. Al-
though no emission is expected from the ring laser back
into the master laser since the ring laser is constrained to
be unidirectional, an optical isolator protects the master
laser from eventual spurious backreﬂections.

B. Spectral analysis

The two most important control parameters of the ex-
periment are injected power and detuning between mas-
ter and slave lasers. We show in Fig. 2 the transmission
of the ring cavity when biased below standalone emission
threshold depending on the detuning between the ring
cavity and the injection beam ∆ = ν − νc, for several val-
ues of injected power. This ﬁgure has been obtained by
scanning the voltage on the piezoelectric actuator and
measuring the time averaged output power of the ring
cavity. At low injected power the transmission curve
shows three symmetric maxima. Each of these peaks
correspond to the resonances of a linear optical cavity
and are separated by 275 MHz as expected due to the
length of the ring. Increasing the injected beam power
the cavity resonances are shifted towards the red (up to
about 60MHz) and become asymmetric. While the left
part of the resonance remains essentially unaltered, the
right part becomes steeper and ﬁnally essentially vertical
for increasing values of the injected power. We underline
that these curves were obtained with a low-bandwidth

detector, which averages out any spatial or temporal dy-
namics. In fact, time trace observations for static value
of the voltage corresponding to the vertical edge of the
resonance show very slow square wave oscillations due
to thermal eﬀects, analyzed in the context of slow-fast
excitability in [17] and described as regenerative oscilla-
tions in [18, 19]. In [17–19], these oscillations have been
attributed to temperature dynamics, which slowly desta-
bilizes both states of an optical bistability loop [36]. In
these condtions, no dynamics faster than the round-trip
time has been observed.

On the contrary spatial dynamics, of course associ-
ated with multimode instabilities in the context of op-
tical resonators, can be readily observed when the bias
current of the ring laser is brought above the lasing emis-
sion threshold. Even in absence of optical injection, the
laser emission consists of several longitudinal modes. In
presence of optical injection, many frequencies therefore
show up in the power spectrum as plotted in Fig. 3. The
vertical lines correspond to the beat notes between suc-
cessive longitudinal modes of the ring laser. Due to the
slightly nonlinear response of the piezo element on the
applied voltage, the actual detuning between the forcing
and the laser modes varies quadratically when the volt-
age is varied. This translates in parabolic shapes for the
beat note between forcing and the laser when the forcing
is far from resonant conditions (voltage close to 0 or 10).
Closer to resonant condition (between 3 and 9 V) the
frequencies are pulled and the beat notes do not follow
this parabolic shape. The actual detuning is varied in
almost two free spectral ranges over the 0-15 V scan. In
this particular case, the strongest frequency is close to
800 MHz, which indicates that the forcing frequency is
detuned about three free spectral ranges from the domi-
nant laser cavity mode. Nevertheless, many other longi-
tudinal modes are also involved and, depending on spe-
ciﬁc conditions, the full width of the spectrum can reach
about 10 GHz.

C.

Instabilities of the homogeneous solution

Time traces monitored by the high bandwidth detec-
tor contains all the information that can be extracted
from a pure intensity measurement but actually this is
not the most convenient way to visualize the data.
In
fact, most of the traces are exceedingly complex and the
phenomena taking place can only be grasped by observ-
ing in a speciﬁc comoving reference frame. This is ob-
tained by acquiring very long real time measurements
(from 10 to 200 million points) and splitting this array
of points in many segments of length equal to one cavity
roundtrip time. These segments are then stacked on top
of each other, which provide a space-time representation
of the dynamics, the horizontal axis being equivalent to
space inside the cavity while the vertical dimension de-
scribes the evolution in units of roundtrips. Many spatio-
temporal regimes can be straightforwardly analyzed in
this representation whereas some of them would be very
diﬃcult to grasp in a purely temporal representation.

In Fig. 4 (left panel) we show an example of a plane
wave instability. Here the whole spatial extension of the
system changes state at about roundtrip 260, switching
from a high power to a low power state, both of them
locked at the frequency of the external forcing. The two
vertical time traces on the left correspond to the evolu-
tion of two diﬀerent points of space (marked by the ver-
tical lines in the space-time diagram), which appear to
be very well synchronized. Also the small amplitude os-
cillations which appear between roundtrips 400 and 500
take place essentially along the whole spatial extension
of the system, indicating a fundamentally single mode
behavior. On the contrary, on the right panel of Figure
4, we show the growth of an instability which involves
several longitudinal modes.
In this case, starting from
a stationary homogeneous solution a spatially periodic
pattern develops and drifts.

right frame), embedded in a uniformly phase locked back-

space units. The width of this pulse depends in a non
trivial way on the detuning between the forcing and the
closest laser mode but pulses as narrow as 200 ps have
been observed. Note that this breadth amounts to about
1/18 of the roundtrip time, as it will be commented fur-
ther on. In this regime, the whole system is locked to the
external forcing, except for the pulse, which also con-
sists of a 2π relative phase rotation of the slave laser
ﬁeld with respect to the injected ﬁeld (top right frame).
In order to get an indication for the robustness of these
wave packets, we have acquired time traces correspond-
ing to 40 km propagation (i.e. 4× 104 roundtrips, which
corresponds to the maximal record length of our oscillo-
scope). Then we have superimposed the corresponding
4× 104 observations of the pulse and superimposed them
accurately (eﬀectively cancelling any jitter) on a color-
coded bidimensional histogram mimicking analogue oscil-
loscope persistence (bottom-right frame). The very nar-
row resulting distribution indicates that these wavepack-
ets are extremely robust, most of the dispersion of the
curves actually resulting from electrical noise in the de-
tector and oscilloscope. Since several of these non dis-
persing wave packets can coexist independently of each
other, they have been analyzed as phase solitons in [15].
In [15] the chiral charge of these solitons (set by the ro-
tation direction of the relative phase) has been shown to
originate from chaotic regions, in which the electric ﬁeld
amplitude can vanish leading to a phase defect. Nev-
ertheless, chaotic regions do not always carry the chiral
charge which will allow soliton stability. For example in
Fig. 6, we show the evolution of the system towards a
fully locked state without any soliton. At roundtrip 0,
more than half of the system is phase locked while the
remaining part is chaotic and two fronts are connecting

both states. Interestingly the left and right front diﬀer
notably but inside the chaotic domain there is no obvious
asymmetry. In the course of time the left and right front
drift at constant but diﬀerent speeds. This front propa-
gation is strongly reminiscent of observations realized in
transverse [20] and in delayed optical systems [21]. Since
no suﬃcient pinning force exist on the fronts [20, 22, 23]
the relative motion of the fronts leads to continuous con-
traction of the chaotic domain which ﬁnally disappears.

III. THEORY

In order to describe ﬁeld evolution in the laser with co-
herent injection sketched in Fig. 1 we extended the model
described in [24, 25] to include ﬁeld propagation. Such a
model can be easily retraced to widespread ones in multi-
mode laser theory, incorporating the complex and pecu-
liar optical features of semiconductor lasers and avoiding
the heavy, ﬁrst-principle, many-body quantum mechani-
cal treatment. Speciﬁcally, this is done by using a phe-
nomenological formula for the frequency and carrier den-
sity dependence of the gain and refractive index to ﬁt the
microscopic susceptibility. This leads to a simple diﬀer-
ential equation for temporal evolution of the macroscopic
polarization P in the semiconductor active medium that
can be coupled with the equations for the electric ﬁeld
E and the carrier density N to provide a complete and
self-consistent description of the system dynamics.

in the latter the diﬀraction term is neglected. The de-

σ/b remains constant, since it appears only via Λ, η and

to the quantitative aspects of the results but not to their
substance.

We observe that Maxwell-Bloch equations for multi-
longitudinal mode emission, analogous to Eqs. (19)–(21),
were introduced in [10] for a two-level unidirectional ring
laser with injected ﬁeld.
In that system a multimode
instability, due to the competition among the injected
ﬁeld frequency and the free running laser frequency was
analyzed in detail.

The rate-equation model has been numerically tested ver-
sus the complete one (Eqs. (19)-(21)) for several relevant
cases and it has proved capable of describing coherent
sceneries as for dynamics and stability of locked/unlocked
states and phase solitons. This evidence, whose deeper
analysis will be the object of further work, lead us to
use the reduced approach in the systematic study of the
phase solitons properties.

C.

Injection locked solution and its stability

The shape of the stationary curves given by Eqs. (24)-
(25) depends on the parameters µ, α, θ and it can exhibit
bistability for suitable values of those parameters. Fig.
7 shows the bistability domains in the (x, θ) plane for
diﬀerent values of µ and ﬁxed α. The equation for the
boundaries of the bistability is [25]

θ± = − µα ±(cid:112)µ2x2(1 + α2) − [(1 + x)2 − µ]2

.

(1 + x)2

Using Eq.
(26) we can derive the value of θS and xS
corresponding to the rightmost point of the bistability
domain (vertical tangent) [25]. In particular, one ﬁnds
θS = −µα/(1 + xS)2, which implies that in order to have
bistability the detuning θ must be negative, i.e. the in-
jection frequency must be red detuned with respect to
the cavity resonance.

We study the stability of the stationary solution Es,
Ps, Ds as in [2] assuming spatio-temporal perturbations

If the stationary curve is S-shaped the equation c0 = 0
is satisﬁed at the turning points of the curve which
means that, as usual, the negative slope part of the curve
is unstable. Another solution of the equation, which
exists even if the stationary curve is single valued, is
µ− 1, which corresponds to the injection locking

threshold, i.e. the stationary solution is unstable when
the injected amplitude is so small that x < xIL. This
result agrees with that of a two-level laser, where the in-
jection locking threshold is given by xIL = µ − µthr for
a class-B laser and by xIL =
class-A laser [2]. In our case we are in the class-A limit
because σ (cid:28) b and we have µthr = 1. On the other
hand, c4 is always nonnegative and it is null for Ds = 1,
i.e. x = µ − 1. This explains the existence of a vertical
asymptote in the instability domains shown in Fig. 8 for
typical cases.

(black line). On the contrary if θ + α is positive but very
small, null, or negative a part of the upper branch in
unstable against a band of sidemodes. In this case the
instability domain starts from the saddle node whenθ +α
is null or negative (red and green curves) or from a dif-
ferent point on the upper branch when θ + α is positive.
We will focus in the rest of the paper on the latter case
θ = −2.97 where the whole upper branch is stable. The
corresponding S-shaped curve is shown in the ﬁgure in-
set together with the three ﬁxed points for y = 0.0014,
denoted as A, B, and C.

D. Numerical simulations

We looked for phase solitons starting from point C in
Fig. 8 where the system is excitable in the absence of
propagation (∂/∂z = 0).

A stable soliton is obtained by superimposing to the
stable locked state C a positive phase kink of 2π along z
for the ﬁeld, having the form Φ+(z) = 4 tan−1 [exp(−βz)]
with β large to have a steep kink. We checked that a
stable soliton can be created in that way with any β
larger than about 5. This is to be expected, since phase
solitons are robust attractors of the system. The only
observed diﬀerence is in the build-up time, which is the
larger the less steep is the phase jump (i.e. the smaller
is β).

Phase solitons are stable over a ﬁnite interval of locked
states C which begins approximately at the left turning
point of the bistable curve and whose extension increases
with the pump µ as shown in Fig. 9.

tion corresponding to the ﬁxed point A in Fig.8, the 1 and

is characterized by spatio-temporal turbulence, while
above the right stability boundary the system invariably
approaches the uniform stable locked state.

Diﬀerently from what happens in driven oscillatory
systems described by the a forced GL equation [14] that
preserves the parity symmetry, and in agreement with
the experiments, in our multi longitudinal mode laser
the “negative” chiral charge is unstable. In fact, as illus-
trated in Fig. 10, the addition of a negative phase kink
Φ−(z) = 2π − 4 tan−1 [exp(−βz)] to the ﬁeld phase ex-
cites a negative charged phase soliton that after a rather
short transient, spontaneously undergoes a phase kink

FIG. 9: Phase solitons existence range in terms of injected
ﬁeld amplitude y versus the pump µ. We set θ = −2.97 while
the other parameters are as in Fig.8.

In order to speed up the simulations, we obtained the
latter results by numerical integration of the reduced
model equations Eqs.
(22)-(23), after checking their
consistence with the complete model. We observe
that below the left stability boundary the system falls
towards the unstable lower state, where its dynamics

optical injection. At variance with most previous works
on the topic, we focus on a strongly multimode regime
and the resulting spatio-temporal eﬀects. Thanks to a
balanced choice of the geometrical parameters of the ex-
periment, we are able to observe long term dynamics still
resolving the most detailed features.
In particular we
have presented observations of plane-wave and modula-
tional instabilities. In a suitable spatio-temporal repre-
sentation we have been able to describe complex time
series in terms of motion of fronts connecting chaotic
and phase locked domains. When these chaotic domains
contain a chiral charge, the inward motion of fronts is
halted and chirally charged solitons emerge. We have
measured the propagation of these phase solitons over
40 km distance and therefore shown their extreme ro-
bustness. Most of these observations can be understood
from the general literature in forced oscillatory media,
but at least two very unexpected features could be de-
scribed only with the use of a more speciﬁc modeling:
phase solitons are observed for only one sign of chiral
charge and left and right fronts diﬀer strongly. The ex-
perimental results are paired by a detailed derivation of
the model sketched in [15] where a linear stability of the
homogeneous phase locked solutions was performed. This
model was further reduced to a set of rate-equations in-
cluding propagation which are still able to capture all the
speciﬁc features of the experiment, contrary to the over-
simpliﬁed approximation of an instantaneous medium re-
sponse. From this, we conclude that the asymmetry of
the fronts and the instability of one of the two possible
chiral signs results from the non-instantaneous medium
dynamics.
In order to clarify this point, experiments
based on the propagation of light in instantaneous media
would certainely be insightful.
In particular, the anal-
ysis of rising and falling fronts in the regime of coexis-
tence of pattern and homogeneous state outside the front
pinning region in coherently driven Kerr ring resonators
[31, 32] would be particularly interesting. On the other
hand, theoretical analysis dedicated to the stability of
chirally charged walls [33] might also shed more light on
the origin of the instability of the negatively charged soli-
tons. In addition, the destabilization of solitons (which
is hard to address with our Partial Diﬀerential Equation
model) might be more tractable with models based on
Delayed Diﬀerential Equations [34, 35], whose analysis
could therefore prove very insightful.

Finally, our models predict that the pulse width associ-
ated to the intensity shape of the phase solitons could be
signiﬁcantly reduced to the ps of sub-ps scale if a shorter
cavity is considered and the medium response is made
correspondingly faster to ensure a formally analogue dy-
namical behavior in the multimode regime.

states and unstable states move at constant speed. The

sign reversal. This is accomplished with by a passage
of the ﬁeld through the origin (E = 0 ⇐⇒ Im(E) =
Re(E) = 0) in the phase space trajectory (see Fig. 5.b),
which is associated with the creation of a transient phase
defect.

Very interestingly for applications to all optical inten-
sity [27, 28] or phase [29] information encoding, the multi-
stability among the homogeneous locked state, the 1 and
the 2 phase solitons solutions was demonstrated by su-
perimposing to the stable homogeneous background ﬁrst
a positive kink and then a second one centered in a dif-
ferent position (see Fig. 11).

Finally, one of the striking experimental observations
is the asymmetry between right and left fronts shown in
Fig. 6. This feature, which was not observed in numer-
ical simulations of the forced Ginzburg-Landau equation
[15], is on the contrary clearly visible when simulating
the full model or the rate-equation model as shown in
Fig. 12 and then we conclude that it is not related to
the propagative nature of the system but to the non-
instantaneous semiconductor medium. Similarly to the
experimental observation, the growth of the locked state
seems to result from a convective instability since this
state drifts towards the right faster than it grows. How-
ever, the distinction is of course strongly related to the
chosen reference frame [30] and in the present case of
periodic boundary conditions the stable state ends up
invading the whole system in any case.
