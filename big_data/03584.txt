Abstract

Recent experiments reveal that the strained bulk HgTe can be regard as a three-dimensional topological
insulator (TI). Motivated by this, we explore the strain eﬀects on the magnetotransport properties of the
HgTe surface states at magnetic ﬁeld. We analytically derive the zero frequency Hall and collisional conduc-
tivities, and ﬁnd that the substrate induced strain associated with the surface index of carriers, can result
in the well seperated surface quantum Hall plateaus and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. These eﬀects can
be used to generate and detect surface polarization.

Introduction

Recently, two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs) have drawn much attention
in condensed matter physics [1–11]. The relevant researches on 3D TIs mostly focus on Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3, and
Sb2Te3 compounds, which possess a bulk energy gap and gapless conducting surface states [7–9]. Thereinto, the
surface states arise from the mismatch of the bulk topological invariants on two sides of the surface, and can be
regarded as the 2D nonideal Dirac fermions with a single Dirac cone at high symmetry points in the ﬁrst Brillouin
zone [7, 8, 10]. These unique properties account for the common features with graphene [1, 3, 12]. However, such
3D TIs have strong defect doping and low carrier mobility in experiment, so that the bulk conductivity always
obscures the surface charge transport. Typically, the predicted quantized magnetoelectric eﬀect [13,14] and the
surface Majorana fermions [15], can be found only when bulk carriers are negligible compared to the surface
states. Hence, experimentally reaching the intrinsic TI regime, where bulk carriers are absent, is now the central
focus of the ﬁeld.

While so far the focus has been on the above mentioned compounds, recently growing attention is being paid
to HgTe quantum wells [16], in which the TI surface states were ﬁrstly predicted and observed [1,2]. Bulk HgTe
also has Dirac-like surface states (Refs. 17 and 18) that originate from the inversion between Γ6 electron and Γ8
light-hole bands, while the bulk band of Γ8 heavy-hole coexists with the surface state band, so that the surface
states are always coupled by metallic bulk states [17, 18]. This means that 3D HgTe is a semimetal and thus
not a TI in the strict sense. With strain applied, a bulk insulating gap (∼ 22 meV) opens up at the touching
point between the light- and heavy-hole Γ8 bands, and accordingly the strained bulk HgTe becomes the real
TI [3, 18]. Further transport measurements for the strained HgTe on CdTe substrate exhibit the Rashba-like
splitting induced by the inversion symmetry breaking in a magnetic ﬁeld [18, 19]. Also, the Landau levels (LLs)
are found to remain degenerate as long as the hybridization can be neglected between the top and bottom
surface states (e.g. 70-nm-thick HgTe).

Motivated by this, we have theoretically investigate the strain eﬀects on the Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH)
oscillations and Hall plateaus in the zero frequency (dc) collisional and Hall conductivities using the Kubo
formalism. These magnetic oscillations appear due to the interplay of the quantum LLs with the Fermi energy,
and serve as a powerful technique to investigate the Fermi surface and the spectrum of electron excitations. Our
ﬁndings show that the substrate induced strain could remove the LLs’ surface degeneracy in inversion symmetric

Dirac cones on the top and bottom surfaces, which is supported by HgTe transport experiments [18, 19]. Thus,
the Dirac particles of diﬀerent surfaces present the well seperated quantum Hall and SdH eﬀects with diﬀerent
amplitudes and phases. Accordingly, this gives rise to the splitting of LLs and the asymmetric spectrum of the
conductivity, in company with the mixture of LLs. Furthermore, we clarify the connections of the SdH and
Hall conductivities for diﬀerent surfaces to the abnormal integer Hall plateaus and SdH beating pattern, and
the strain induced changes in the zero-mode conductivity at diﬀerent surfaces, etc. These phenomena, absent
in a conventional 2D electron gas (2DEG) and even in graphene [20–26], should be attributed to the anomalous
spectrum of surface states in a fully stained TI. Our results are general and can also be applied to Bi2Se3,
Sb2Te3, and Bi2Te3, which would be very great news and certainly meet much interest by the experimental
groups.

2 Results and discussion

The surface states moves in the x-y plane under strain (∆) induced by the substrate, subjected to an external
magnetic ﬁeld B = (0, 0, B)]. Here we use the two Dirac cones model to describe the experiments, and the 2D
nonideal Dirac quasiparticle Hamiltonian reads

H = τzυF (σxπy − σyπx) + τzI∆.

(1)

In Eq. (1), the ﬁrst term arises from the spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Due to the strong SOC, the TIs exhibit a
unique spin-momentum locking, which is essential for modeling topologically nontrivial insulators. The second
term results from the strain energy with I for the identity matrix and τz = ±1 for the two surfaces of top
(facing vacuum) and bottom (at CdTe interface). The Fermi velocity υF of surface states in mercury telluride is
4.0× 105 m/s smaller than that in graphene (υF = 1.0× 106 m/s), {σx, σy} is the vector of spin Pauli matrices,
and π = p+eA/c is the canonical momentum with c for the speed of light and A for the vector potential yielding
Landau gauge A = (0, Bx, 0). The resulting eigenvalues are [18, 19]

Figures 1 exhibits the collisional conductivity of the top and bottom surface states with the SdH periodicity
for zero and ﬁnite strain. For null strain, the spectra are perfectly symmetric with a single peak at the CNP
conﬁrming the zero-energy TI states (see Fig. 1). This symmetry indicates the surface degeneracy in LLs and
thus the SdH oscillations in σxx are in phase for diﬀerent surfaces. Whereas, with strain applied, the single
peak splits two ones with a gap opening at the CNP and a well resolved beating pattern of SdH oscillations
appears away from the CNP. To clarify these phenomena, we further plot Fig. 2. As seen, the SdH oscillations
for diﬀerent surfaces are out of phase. This demonstrate that the strain breaks the LLs’ surfaces degeneracy
as well with the inversion symmetry of two Dirac cones at both surfaces, which agrees well with the results of
experiments and two Dirac cones model [18, 19]. Here we remark that such a gap (∆gap = 2∆) (see arrow line
1) does not open between the electrons and holes for the single Dirac point in each a surface, but between the
two Dirac points at both surfaces. This indicates the two Dirac points at both surfaces shift in the diﬀerent
directions, suggesting the occurrence of two inversion asymmetric Dirac cones.

+1), top hole (τ h

+1), bottom electron (τ e

−1), and bottom hole (τ h

Further analysis reveals that the two peaks in Fig. 1 for ﬁnite strain are the superposition of four peaks
in Fig. 2, i.e., top electron (τ e
−1). In the same
surface, the zero mode peaks do not split, indicating that the Dirac point at each a surface is not gapped.
However, for the top electrons and bottom holes, the two peaks do split since the strain lifts the degeneracy
of their levels at n = 0. Furthermore, for the bottom electrons and top holes, the two peaks not only split
but also exchange (see arrow line 2 in Fig. 2), suggesting a mixture of LLs. In a word, the strain removes the
LLs’ degeneracy in inversion symmetric Dirac cones at both surfaces, and causes the asymmetric conductivity
spectrum presenting diﬀerent amplitudes or diﬀerent phases or both two ones. Such a lifting of degeneracy
usually occurs due to Zeeman coupling in a conventional 2DEG. However, Zeeman coupling here cannot remove
the degeneracy since the inversion symmetry is preserved by the magnetic ﬁeld. And the experiments have
already deﬁnitely excluded the inﬂuence of hybridization between the top and bottom surface states since the
width of surface state (2 − 3 nm) is much smaller than the thickness of sample (70-nm) [18, 19]. So the highly
possible mechanism for the degeneracy lifting (or the LLs splitting) is the inversion asymmetry due to the strain.
Also, from Eq. (2), one can see the surface degeneracy of LLs is removed for any nonzero ∆, which makes the
mechanism of inversion-symmetry breaking the most likely explanation for the removed degeneracy. As pointed
out in Ref. [18,19], the strain induced diﬀerent electrostatic environments of both surfaces, breaks the inversion
symmetry of two Dirac cones, lifts the surface degeneracy in LLs, and leads to the asymmetric conductivity for
diﬀerent surfaces.

The dc Hall conductivity σyx is derived from the nondiagonal elements of the conductivity tensor as

In essence, σyx is the diﬀusive contribution as the collisional contribution to Hall conductivity vanishes, since
the diﬀerence of the matrix elements xζ − xζ ′ = 0. The following calculations require summing the terms that
include all combinations of the matrix elements Σλλ′ , that is, Σ++, Σ+−, Σ−+, Σ−−. On the same line [30], we

In the limit of zero strain and T → 0, Eq. (39) can be reduced to σyx = (cid:0)2e2/h(cid:1) (n + 1
2 ) with the prefactor 2
resulting from the surface degeneracy. Hall plateaus appear at the ﬁlling factor ±1, ±3, ±5,..., agreeing well
with the transport experiments [18, 19].
The collisional and Hall conductivities for diﬀerent surfaces are both shown in Fig. 3 as a function of the
chemical potential for zero and ﬁnite strain. As shown, under strain some extra Hall plateaus arise and the
steps between plateaus coincide with sharp peaks of the collisional conductivity. Resembling Figs. 1 and 2,
this originates from the strain removed surface degeneracy in LLs, so that the density of states could form
the diﬀerent Landau ladders for diﬀerent surfaces, thereby causing the extra quantum plateaus at even ﬁlling
factors 0, ±2, ±4, ±6, ±8, ..., etc. As well known, the Hall conductivity of a single Dirac cone in strainless
graphene is given by σyx = (2n + 1) e2/h with the odd ﬁlling factors 2n + 1, directly leading to the total ﬁlling
factors (4n + 2) (Ref. [31]). It seems that the new Hall plateaus for a single Dirac cone arise from the extra
value σxy = ve2/h with the ﬁlling factors 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ..., etc. In fact, these values are nonexistent, and the
abnormal Hall behaviour should be attributed to the phase diﬀerence of Hall conductivity for diﬀerent surfaces
induced by the strain.

3 Conclusions

In conclusion, we have investigated the strain eﬀects on the quantum magnetotransport properties for the
surface states of TIs at ﬁnite temperature and magnetic ﬁeld. The strain are shown to remove the surface
degeneracy of LLs in the two inversion symmetric Dirac cones. Thus, the Dirac particles of diﬀerent surfaces
present the well seperated quantum Hall and SdH eﬀects with diﬀerent amplitudes and phases. This accordingly
gives rise to the extra Hall plateaus and the SdH beating pattern away from the CNP. In addition, the SdH
conductivity under strain possess two zero-mode peaks around the CNP, while for null strain there is just a
single CNP peak. We interpret the two peaks are the superposition of four peaks arising from top electron, top
hole, bottom electron, and bottom hole. Further analysis reveals that, in the same surface, the zero mode peaks
do not split, indicating the Dirac point at each a surface is not gapped. However, for the top electrons and
bottom holes, the two peaks do split since the strain lifts the degeneracy of their levels at n = 0. Furthermore,
for the bottom electron and top hole, the two peaks not only split but also exchange, suggesting a mixture of
LLs. These should be suﬃcient to well appreciate the experimental results on the quantum magnetotransport
of the surface states of HgTe.
