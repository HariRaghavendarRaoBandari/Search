We study fully hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)-encapsulated graphene spin valve devices at room
temperature. The device consists of a graphene channel encapsulated between two crystalline hBN
ﬂakes; thick-hBN ﬂake as a bottom gate dielectric substrate which masks the charge impurities from
SiO2/Si substrate and single-layer thin-hBN ﬂake as a tunnel barrier. Full encapsulation prevents
the graphene from coming in contact with any polymer/chemical during the lithography and thus
gives homogeneous charge and spin transport properties across diﬀerent regions of the encapsulated
graphene. Further, even with the multiple electrodes in between the injection and the detection
electrodes which are in conductivity mismatch regime, we observe spin transport over 12.5 µm long
distance under the thin-hBN encapsulated graphene channel, demonstrating the clean interface and
the pin-hole free nature of the thin-hBN as an eﬃcient tunnel barrier.

I.

INTRODUCTION

ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes.

Graphene is considered as an ideal material for spin-
tronics due to its low intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, small
hyperﬁne interaction, tunable carrier density and high
electron mobility1–3 even at room temperature which is
important for future applications. Theoretically it is es-
timated to show long spin relaxation length (λs) of 100
µm and high spin relaxation time (τs) of 100 ns4,5. At
the moment, experimentally these values are reported
up to λs = 30.5 µm and τs = 12.6 ns6.
In a quest to
ﬁgure out the sources limiting the intrinsic spin trans-
port in graphene, there have been several experiments,
which suggest that the role of underlying substrate and
the quality of tunnel barrier is crucial7.

The quality of substrate plays an important role in de-
termining the charge and the spin transport character-
istics of graphene. An atomically ﬂat hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) substrate has shown to provide a good
base for high mobility graphene8 and long spin relax-
ation length9 because hBN has less charged impurities
and the thickness of the bottom-hBN moves the graphene
away from the charged impurities in the SiO2 substrate.
Also the eﬀect of the electron-hole puddles can be dif-
ferent for diﬀerent substrates and it is lower with a hBN
substrate10.

Recently, Kretinin et al.11 demonstrated the high elec-
tronic quality of graphene by encapsulating it from sur-
roundings with diﬀerent two-dimensional (2D) crystals
such as hBN and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD).
However, this device geometry comprised of one dimen-
sional edge electrodes8 with a thick semiconducting TMD
top layer which is not compatible for standard four probe
non-local spin transport measurements.
In the present
work, we replace the TMD with an atomically thin hBN
ﬂake, which serves two purposes. First, it acts as an
encapsulating layer. Second, it acts as a tunnel barrier
replacing the conventional oxide tunnel barrier. There-
fore it allows to probe the charge and the spin transport
properties of the encapsulated graphene with multiple

The previous studies have shown that the graphene
interface with spin sensitive ferromagnetic electrodes af-
fects the spin transport behaviour. Further, the conven-
tional oxide tunnel barriers used in spintronic devices suf-
fer from pinholes, inhomogeneous coverage, non-uniform
growth, and consequently contributing to the low spin
transport properties7,12. A 2D-layer of thin-hBN with
close lattice match to graphene has been shown to exhibit
pin-hole free tunnelling characteristics13,14. It is also pre-
dicted to enhance the spin injection eﬃciency from a fer-
romagnet into graphene15.

Yamaguchi et al.16 ﬁrst reported spin injection through
exfoliated monolayer hBN tunnel barrier into bilayer
graphene resulting in quite low spin transport parame-
ters (τs = 56 ps, Ds = 0.034 m2/s, λs = 1.35 µm) and
low mobility (µ = 2700 cm2/Vs) of graphene. Further,
Kamalakar et al.17 and Fu et al.18 used large scale chemi-
cal vapour deposited (CVD) bilayer hBN-tunnel barriers
for spin injection into graphene. The spin polarization
increased with CVD hBN barriers. However, the quality
of graphene channel is limited by the wet transfer tech-
nique used for transferring CVD hBN on to graphene. In
contrast, we use a dry pick-up and transfer technique19 in
order to completely cover the underlying graphene with
a thin-hBN ﬂake, which acts a tunnel barrier and also
shields the graphene from external polymers and chemi-
cals during the lithography process.

It is also worth discussing here that the previous re-
ports on spin transport in hBN encapsulated graphene
are quite promising in terms of improved spin trans-
port parameters20,21. However extracting the correct
spin transport parameters is not straightforward due to
inhomogeneous spin transport behaviour of the hBN-
encapsulated and the non-hBN-encapsulated graphene
regions. A similar behaviour is also observed for partly
suspended high mobility graphene22. Using our device
geometry, we can achieve more homogeneous charge and
spin transport behaviour in the graphene channel com-
pared to the previously reported results.

In this work, we report a fully hBN-encapsulated

graphene spintronics device to overcome the three afore-
mentioned challenges, namely, 1) the inﬂuence of under-
lying substrate, 2) the inﬂuence of tunnel barrier inter-
face, and 3) the inhomogeneity in graphene channel. We
use a dry pick-up technique which prevents the graphene
from external doping and results in more homogeneous
charge and spin transport parameters at room tempera-
ture.

II. DEVICE FABRICATION

The hBN/graphene/hBN stack is prepared following
the dry pick-up and transfer technique8,19. The graphene
and hBN ﬂakes were obtained by the exfoliation of highly
oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG, SPI Supplies, ZYA
grade) and hBN powder (HQ graphene). A 90 nm thick
SiO2/Si substrate is used for exfoliation and identiﬁca-
tion of graphene and thin-hBN ﬂakes as it gives a good
optical contrast to search for thinner graphene23 and
hBN24 ﬂakes down to a monolayer.

A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer stamp pre-
pared with polycarbonate (PC) layer is used to pick-up
the ﬂakes. At ﬁrst, a glass substrate with PDMS/PC
is used to pick-up a thick top-hBN ﬂake which is
used to pick-up the thin-hBN ﬂake followed by pick-
ing up the graphene ﬂake. Then the PC/top-hBN/thin-
hBN/graphene stack is released onto a thick bottom-hBN
on a SiO2(300 nm)/Si substrate by melting the PC layer.
Next, the PC layer is dissolved in chloroform for 5 hours
at 50 ◦C, followed by annealing in Ar/H2 atmosphere at
350 ◦C for 12 hours to remove the leftover PC residues on
top of the thin-hBN and the top-hBN. It is important to
note that the graphene beneath the thin-hBN does not
come in contact with polymers during the fabrication due
to the full encapsulation by hBN ﬂakes.

Thereafter, electron-beam lithography is used for pat-
terning of electrodes on the poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) coated stack followed by electron-beam evap-
oration to deposit 65 nm of ferromagnetic cobalt (Co)
for spin sensitive electrodes. Cobalt is capped with 4 nm
thick aluminum (Al) layer to prevent it from oxidation. A
schematic of the layer-by-layer device structure is shown
in Figure 1(a).

An optical micrograph of the fabricated device is
shown in Figure 1(b) where the graphene and the thin-
hBN ﬂakes are outlined with the black and the white
dashed lines respectively. Due to a slight misalignment
during the pick-up process, a region of 0.1 - 0.2 µm width
along the top edge of the graphene ﬂake is not covered by
the thin-hBN. However, the electrodes in between E2 and
E5 are deposited on top of the thin-hBN layer, avoiding
the uncovered top-edge graphene region. The thin-hBN
encapsulated graphene does not come in contact with
polymers whereas the graphene regions which are not
covered by the thin-hBN are touched by PC and PMMA
polymers during the fabrication.

We performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) imag-

neath by the thick bottom-hBN (21 nm) ﬂake and encapsu-

agreement with the experimentally reported thickness for

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We report the measurements for the diﬀerent regions
of fully encapsulated graphene channel as labelled in the
optical image shown in Figure 1(b). Speciﬁcally, Ch1
(4.5 µm, between E2 and E3) and Ch3 (3 µm, between E4
and E5) regions consist of graphene encapsulated by thin-
hBN. Ch2 (5 µm, between E3 and E4) region comprised
of graphene encapsulated by the thin-hBN. On top of the
thin-hBN, we put thick top-hBN (6nm) ﬂake which serves
as a topgate dielectric. Finally, Ch4 (12.5 µm, between
E2 and E5) consists of region across the whole thin-hBN
encapsulated graphene.

The

area

product

(RcA)

resistance

for
graphene/hBN/graphene tunnel junction is reported to
scale exponentially with the number of hBN layers14. We
characterize the thin-hBN/graphene interface resistance
(Rc) using a three probe measurement scheme. The RcA
product for the electrodes E(2-5) is found to be in the
range of 0.3 - 1.1 kΩµm2 which agrees with the reported
values for single-layer hBN tunnel barriers14,17,18. Both
the AFM and the RcA analysis conﬁrm the single-layer
nature of the thin-hBN ﬂake.
All the measurements are carried out at room temper-
ature in a vacuum of 10−6 mbar. Charge transport mea-
surements are carried out in a local four probe measure-
ment scheme. An ac current is passed between electrodes
E1 and E6 (Fig. 1(b)), and the voltage drop is measured
across the electrodes for diﬀerent transport channel re-
gions in between. The measured square resistance (Rsq)
is presented in Figure 1(c) for three diﬀerent graphene
channel regions Ch1, Ch2, and Ch3. The square resis-
tance for the thin-hBN encapsulated regions (in Ch(1-
3)) show charge neutrality point (CNP) around -12 V
and for the top-hBN encapsulated part of the Ch2 region
show it around -23 V. A small bump at -12 V in Rsq data
for Ch2 region corresponds to the thin-hBN encapsulated
parts on either side of the top-hBN.

The ﬁeld eﬀect mobility (µ) of graphene channel is cal-
culated by ﬁtting the Rsq data (Fig. 1(c)) using the re-
lation, Rsq = 1/(neµ + σ0) + ρs, where e is the elec-
tronic charge, n is the carrier density, σ0 is the resid-
ual conductivity at the CNP, and ρs is the contribution
from short range scattering26,27. The ﬁtted values of the
electron mobility for three diﬀerent regions are µCh1 =
8600 cm2/Vs, µCh2 = 11800 cm2/Vs and µCh3 = 8200
cm2/Vs. The close values of mobility at diﬀerent re-
gions reﬂect that the graphene channel is homogeneous
under the thin-hBN encapsulation. A relatively higher
value of mobility for Ch2 region is attributed to the cen-
tral top-hBN encapsulated graphene while the remaining
thin-hBN encapsulated graphene (Ch1 and Ch3) on ei-
ther side of top-hBN has an uncovered graphene edge of
0.1 - 0.2 µm width which are exposed to polymers during
the fabrication.

The spin transport measurements are performed in a
four probe non-local geometry (Fig. 2(a)) at room tem-
perature using standard ac lock-in technique with cur-

rents of 10 - 20 µA. We inject a spin polarized current
using an ac current source (Iac) and measure the non-
local voltage (Vnl) while sweeping an in-plane magnetic
ﬁeld (By) parallel to the long axis of the ferromagnetic
electrodes. The width of the electrodes is varied from 0.2
µm to 0.8 µm in order to switch magnetization of the
electrodes at diﬀerent coercive ﬁelds. As the By is swept
from a negative magnetic ﬁeld to a positive ﬁeld, steps in
Rnl(=Vnl/Iac) are observed whenever the magnetization
of the two inner electrodes changes between parallel and
anti-parallel conﬁgurations. The inﬂuence of the outer
electrodes will be diminished if chosen far from the injec-
tion/detection electrodes, resulting in a typical two-level
spin valve signal.
In order to asses the spin transport
nature of graphene, we extract the spin relaxation pa-
rameters from the Hanle spin precession measurements.
Hanle measurements are carried out in a four probe
non-local spin valve geometry as shown in Figure 2(a)
while the magnetic ﬁeld is applied perpendicular (Bz)
to the device plane. As the polarization of the in-
jected spins is along y-direction, Bz causes the spins
to precess in x-y plane with a Larmor frequency ωL =
geµBBz/, where the Lande g factor g = 2, µB the
Bohr magneton and  the reduced Plank constant.

order to eliminate the background magnetoresistance ef-

is the Hanle signal for
the parallel(anti-parallel) magnetization conﬁguration of
the injection and the detection electrodes. The resulting
precession data ∆Rnl is ﬁtted with the stationary solu-
tions to the 1D Bloch equation in the diﬀusion regime;
Ds (cid:53)2 (cid:126)µs − (cid:126)µs/τs + (cid:126)ωL × (cid:126)µs = 0, where µs is the spin
chemical potential, Ds is the spin diﬀusion constant, and
τs is the spin relaxation time.

The spin valve signals for the Ch2 region and across the
whole thin-hBN encapsulated (Ch4) region are shown in
Figure 2(b) and 2(d), measured at the backgate voltage
of 30 V. The corresponding Hanle signals and their ﬁtting
curves are shown in Figure 2(c) and 2(e).

√

The extracted value of τs for diﬀerent channel regions
(Ch(1-4)) is in the range of 135 - 176 ps, Ds is of 0.11
- 0.18 m2/s, and the corresponding value of the spin re-
laxation length λs (=
Dsτs) is of 4.2 - 5.1 µm. The
charge diﬀusion coeﬃcient (Dc) calculated from the re-
sistivity (Rsq) data in Figure 1(c) is in the range of 0.07
- 0.09 m2/s. As the values of Dc and Ds are in a rea-
sonable agreement, we conﬁrm the reliability of Hanle
ﬁtting22,28.

As we can see from the Hanle ﬁtting data (Fig. 2(c)
and 2(e)), the spin relaxation parameters do not diﬀer
much for diﬀerent encapsulated regions under thin-hBN.
Besides, the mobility values also lie close to each other
(Fig. 1(c)). It indicates that a consistent charge and spin
transport behaviour is observed across diﬀerent regions
of the thin-hBN encapsulated graphene.

The values of spin relaxation parameters are quite low
compared to the graphene on hBN9 or even partly encap-
sulated by hBN20. The thin-hBN ﬂake is of single-layer
and it resulted in low interface resistance (Rc) values for
the electrodes E(2-5), 0.6 - 2.1 kΩ which lie in the same
order of the spin resistance (Rλ) for the thin-hBN encap-
sulated graphene, 0.4 - 1.4 kΩ where Rλ = Rsqλs/W, W
= 1.8 µm is the width of the graphene. These values im-
ply that the device is within the conductivity mismatch
regime28. A similar behaviour is also reported by Yam-
aguchi et al.16 with exfoliated 1L-hBN and Fu et al.18
with CVD 1L-hBN tunnel barriers.

It is also important to note in our device that the ferro-
magnetic cobalt electrodes on top of the thin-hBN layer
are deposited in order to avoid contact with the uncov-
ered (by thin-hBN) graphene edge (Fig.
1(b)). The
proximity of the stray magnetic ﬁeld from the ends of
the cobalt electrodes (between E2 and E5) can act as an
additional dephasing ﬁeld and inﬂuence the spin trans-
port in graphene. Also the uncovered region is exposed
to the PC and PMMA polymers during the fabrication
which can reduce the mobility and spin relaxation time.
Further, we would like to emphasize that the spin diﬀu-
sion is detected across 12.5 µm length of thin-hBN encap-
sulated (Ch4) graphene region (Fig. 2(d-e)) which con-
sists of multiple electrodes in between the spin injection
(E2) and the spin detection (E5) electrodes (Fig. 1(b)).

The conventional oxide-barrier/graphene interfaces are
reported to act as spin sinks especially when their Rc lie
12,28,29 which hinders the long distance spin
close to Rλ
transport in graphene with multiple electrodes. Whereas,
within the conductivity mismatched regime, our device
still performs better than the device with oxide barri-
ers, which might have pin-holes. Hence, we attribute the
observed long distance spin transport behaviour to the
pin-hole free nature of the thin-hBN layer and to the
clean interface of thin-hBN with the graphene compared
to the deposited oxide tunnel barrier.

We would also like to point out that we do not ob-
serve the very long spin relaxation length or high spin
relaxation time as in the case of partly hBN-encapsulated
graphene stack reported by Guimar˜aes et al.20 and it is
worthwhile to mention the diﬀerences between our device
and the stack reported in ref. 20. In our device, PMMA
residues lie at the thin-hBN/cobalt electrode interface
which might aﬀect the spin injection/detection in a dif-
ferent way than in the stack reported in ref. 20, which
has PMMA residues between the graphene and the oxide
tunnel barrier. Further, our device shows lower mobility
and charge diﬀusion constant which also translates to the
lower spin relaxation length.

Furthermore, using our device structure we can control
the electric ﬁeld and the carrier density independently
with the top and the bottom gate electrodes. This allows
us to study i) the electrical control of spin information
in graphene20, and ii) the spin transport across the p/n
junctions created by the topgate and the non-topgate en-
capsulated graphene. It is interesting to study the spin
transport across the p/n junction, which acts as a barrier
for the transmission of spins, and results in high magne-
toresistance and sensitivity in a spin valve transistor30.
A contour plot for the square resistance of the Ch2
region (RCh2
) as a function of Vtg and Vbg is shown in
Figure 3(a). The charge neutrality point (CNP) appears
as a line with a slope of -0.034 which is equivalent to the
ratio of the top and bottom gate dielectric capacitances.
The maximum Rsq of the CNP appears at Vbg ≈ -22.7
V, Vtg ≈ 0 V and decreases along either side of the line.
It is a characteristic behaviour observed with single layer
graphene20. The Vtg independent feature around Vbg =
-22.7 V appears due to the sides of the top-hBN encapsu-
lated region that are non-topgated between the electrodes
E3 and E421.

sq

We can create an eﬀective electric ﬁeld in the top-hBN
encapsulated part of the Ch2 region by modulating the
topgate voltage (Vtg) and the backgate voltage (Vbg)31.
The perpendicular electric ﬁeld can induce a Rashba spin
orbit ﬁeld in graphene20 which can be used to manipulate
the spin transport properties of the topgate encapsulated
graphene channel.

The maximum value of the electric ﬁeld created within
the range of applied Vtg and Vbg is 0.22 V/nm. We do not
observe a signiﬁcant dependence of the spin relaxation
time on the electric ﬁeld. We attribute this to the lower
ﬁeld compared to the Rashba ﬁeld (0.7 V/nm) applied in

5

So we are also able to access the p-doped characteristics
of the non-topgated regions.

A strong dependence of the spin relaxation time (τs)
among the four junction conﬁgurations is observed as
shown in Figure 3(b). On average, the relaxation time is
increased when the n(n’)-doped region changes to p(p’)-
doped region. This can be observed at diﬀerent topgate
voltages as we move from n-n’-n region to n-p’-n region,
and further to p-p’-p region. A possible explanation for
the observed behaviour is that the contacts can induce a
slight doping, as can be seen from the asymmetric square
resistance of graphene in Figure 1(c). This might result
in an additional p-n interface in the p-doped regime, de-
coupling the contacts from the channel and resulting in
higher spin relaxation time for holes. Furthermore, the
gate dependence of spin lifetime in Figure 3(b) does not
show a dip around the CNP20,33 possibly due to the inﬂu-
ence of p-n junctions formed at the edges of the topgated
graphene channel near the CNP.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion,

for the ﬁrst time we demonstrate a
fully hBN-encapsulated graphene device for spintronics
applications. We show that the full encapsulation of
graphene results in homogeneous charge and spin trans-
port properties at room temperature. Charge transport
measurements show uniform mobility across diﬀerent re-
gions of the encapsulated graphene. Spin transport mea-
surements show that a uniform spin relaxation length
across diﬀerent channel regions is achieved with the crys-
talline hBN encapsulation. Further, our device shows
spin transport across the whole thin-hBN encapsulated
region of 12.5 µm length even in the presence of conduc-
tivity mismatch electrodes, demonstrating the potential
of using hBN as a tunnel barrier for graphene spintronics.
The dual gate geometry allowed us to study the eﬀect of
electric ﬁeld on the spin transport. However we do not
observe a signiﬁcant dependence due to the low values
of achieved electric ﬁeld. Moreover, we observe a strong
dependence of the spin relaxation time on diﬀerent p/n
junction conﬁgurations. Further investigation is neces-
sary to explain this behaviour.

Within the Ch2 region, carrier density in non-topgate
encapsulated parts controlled by Vbg whereas the central
topgate encapsulated part is controlled by both Vbg and
Vtg. This clearly resulted in four quadrants represent-
ing diﬀerent p/n junction conﬁgurations32 as indicated
in Figure 3(a). Due to the novelty of our device fabrica-
tion we could see four quadrants compared to the similar
geometry reported in ref. 20 and 21. The non-topgated
graphene regions in ref. 20 and 21 are highly n-doped
by the polycarbonate. However, in our case, graphene in
the topgated region as well as the non-topgated region is
protected by the thin-hBN and is not doped by polymers.
