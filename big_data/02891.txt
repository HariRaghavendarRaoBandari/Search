ABSTRACT

We discuss possible association of fast radio bursts (FRBs) with supergiant
pulses emitted by young pulsars (ages ∼ tens to hundreds of years) born with
regular magnetic ﬁeld but very short – few milliseconds – spin periods. FRBs are
extra-Galactic events coming from distances d (cid:46) 100 Mpc. Most of the dispersion
measure (DM) comes from the material in the freshly ejected SNR shell; for a
given burst the DM should decrease with time. FRBs are not expected to be
seen below ∼ 300 MHz due to free-free absorption in the expanding ejecta. A
supernova might have been detected years before the burst; FRBs are mostly
associated with star forming galaxies.

The model requires that some pulsars are born with very fast spins, of the
˙E
order of few milliseconds. The observed distribution of spin-down powers
˙E.
in young energetic pulsars is consistent with equal birth rate per decade of
Accepting this injection spectrum and scaling the intrinsic brightness of FRBs
with ˙E, we predict the following properties of a large sample of FRBs: (i) the
brightest observed events come from a broad distribution in distances; (ii) for
repeating bursts brightness either remains nearly constant (if the spin-down time
is longer than the age of the pulsar) or decreases with time otherwise; in the latter
case DM ∝ ˙E.

Introduction

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) (Lorimer et al. 2007; Keane et al. 2012; Thornton et al. 2013;
Kulkarni et al. 2014; Spitler et al. 2014) are recently identiﬁed mysterious events that are still
waiting to be understood. Let us ﬁrst summarize brieﬂy the main observation properties and
the key inferences. (Though some of the inferences listed below are based on single FRBs we

– 2 –

assume that these are common properties. Also, see below a separate paragraph discussing
the result of Keane et al. (2016).)

• FRBs are typically milliseconds long events. The observed duration is mostly due to
scattering broadening during propagation (Champion et al. 2015); intrinsic width is
consistent with the δ-function emission in time. Still, the observed duration limits
can be translated to limits on the scale of the emission regions as ≤ 108 cm in size.
Relativistic bulk motion with Γb would modify this estimate by a factor Γ2
b, but then
the corresponding event rates would increase accordingly.

• The rates are estimated as ∼ 103 – 104 per day per sky above 4 mJy per msec (e.g.
Rane et al. 2016, and references therein). The upper limit is barely comparable to the
SN rate up to z ≤ 1 (e.g. Bazin et al. 2009), however, the short duration is inconsistent
with the SN explosion. The high rate of FRBs also excludes violent events like NS-NS
mergers (e.g. Falcke & Rezzolla 2014), that are expected to have rates at least hundred
times lower (Phinney 1991; Burgay et al. 2003). Also, the observed rate of FRBs is,
probably, just a lower limit – there can be an even more numerous population of weaker
FRBs (as demonstrated by the repetitive FRB, Spitler et al. 2016)

• Dispersion measure (DM) of FRBs is in the range few hundreds to few thousands. If
DM is due to the intergalactic medium this would place FRBs at cosmological distances,
z ∼ 1. However, DM is likely to come from the local structures near the sources (Masui
et al. 2015). If DM is local, the isotropic distribution of FRBS on the sky (Petroﬀ et al.
2014; Macquart & Johnston 2015) implies that the typical distance ≥ few tens Mpc.
• FBRs are repetitive but non-periodic (Spitler et al. 2016); present-day overall limits
on repeatability (Petroﬀ et al. 2015b) corresponds to, approximately, not more than a
burst per day for bright bursts (in terms of observed bursts; for highly beamed emission
into an angle 1/∆Ωb the intrinsic repetitiveness will be larger by 4π/∆Ωb). In case of
weaker bursts the repetition rate can be higher (Spitler et al. 2016). Repetitiveness
also excludes violent events like compact object mergers.

• Multi-component structures (Champion et al. 2015) hint at rotation at ∼ millisecond
periods. Multi-component structures can be used as an argument against catastrophic
models like collapse of a NS to a BH, or deconﬁnement of matter and formation of a
quark star (Champion et al. 2015).

• FBRs have relatively ﬂat spectra with index at least ﬂatter than -3.2 (Caleb et al.
2016), or even more ﬂat (Rowlinson et al. 2016). On the other hand, spectra can be
highly variable, possibly with narrow spectral component (Spitler et al. 2016).

– 3 –

• FRBs show both circular (Petroﬀ et al. 2015a) and/or linear polarization (Masui et al.
2015) intrinsic to the source. In addition, Masui et al. (2015) detected intrinsic position
angle (PA) rotation during the burst, possibly consistent with PA swings observed in
pulsar (Radhakrishnan & Cooke 1969).

Many of the above properties stand in sharp contrast to the recently claimed identiﬁca-
tion of the FRB host with an elliptical galaxy at z = 0.45 (the claimed DM would then be
cosmological; the event would be consistent with energetic violent events like NS-NS merger,
Keane et al. 2016). Williams & Berger (2016) (see also ATel #8752) claimed that very
high persistent radio emission is inconsistent with the low star-formation rate – the host is
probably an AGN. Also, small galactic latitude implies lots of scattering in the Galaxy; the
time scale of few days is typical for AGN intra-day variability (Jauncey et al. 2001). From
the theoretical point of view, the result of Keane et al. (2016) – the implied very bright
afterglow, – contradicts the fact that the rate of FRBs is hundreds of times higher than of
violent merger events like NS-NS mergers. Also, the afterglow implied by Keane et al. (2016)
needs about 1045 ergs emitted in radio, diﬀerent by about two orders of magnitude from the
2004 ﬂare from SGR 1806-20 produced total 4 × 1043 ergs (Gaensler et al. 2005). The SGR
afterglow lasted longer, with peak ﬂux about 200 times higher than Keane’s burst (50 mJy
versus 250 µJy) from a distance more than 100 times closer. If the results of Keane et al.
(2016), are conﬁrmed, that would imply two types of FRB progenitors (type I - repeating,
type II - non-repeating). Below we then limit our discussion to the “type I” FRBs.

2. FRB emission site: magnetospheres of neutron stars

Given the above inferences let us estimate parameters at the source. The key unknown
is the distance. Given that the DM is local (Masui et al. 2015), it cannot be used as a
distance estimate. Yet, isotropy of the observed events argues for a local cosmological origin.
As a ﬁducial value we use a typical distance of d = 100 Mpc and take Lorimer burst (Lorimer
et al. 2007, duration 5 msec, peak ﬂux S30Jy, DM=375) as a prototypical example.

The instantaneous (isotropic-equivalent) luminosity LF RB is then
100M pcerg s−1,

LF RB = 4πd2(νFν) = 3.4 × 1041S30Jyd2

while the total radiated energy is

Another requirement for high magnetic ﬁeld in the emission region comes from the

estimate of the wave intensity parameter

where E = (cid:112)L/(c3τ 2) is the typical electric ﬁeld in the wave at the emission site (Luan

& Goldreich 2014). Since the emission is coherent, in unmagnetized plasma the emitting
particles would have highly relativistic Lorentz factor γ⊥ ∼ a and would quickly lose energy
through various radiative processes (e.g. synchrotron in case of large momentum perpendic-
ular to the magnetic ﬁeld). In highly magnetized plasma (in the limit ω (cid:28) ωB) the large
value of the intensity parameter (6) does not necessarily imply high radiative losses of emit-
ting particles. Instead of oscillation under the inﬂuence of the electric ﬁeld of the wave with
Lorentz factor γ ∼ a, in a high magnetic ﬁeld particles experience E × B drift; we need
√
then to replace in Eq. (6) ω → ωB; using (15) we ﬁnd a ∼ 1/
8π. (Also, as is the case for
pulsar radio emission, the radiation should escape induced Compton scattering in the wind
(Wilson & Rees 1978); this can be achieved by suﬃciently fast and/or rareﬁed wind (Sincell
& Krolik 1992).

The above estimates, by exclusion, leave only magnetospheres of neutron stars as viable
loci of the generation of FRBs (Popov & Postnov 2010; Pen & Connor 2015; Cordes &
Wasserman 2016; Spitler et al. 2016)

– 5 –

2.1. Two possible mechanisms for FRBs

2.1.1. Magnetically and rotationally powered: magnetars versus “pulsars on steroids”

Identiﬁcation of FRBs with neutron star and evidence against catastrophic events (col-
lapse, coalescence, etc.) leave two possible mechanisms: (i) radio emission accompanying
giant ﬂares in magnetars (Lyutikov 2002; Popov & Postnov 2010; Lyubarsky 2014; Keane
et al. 2012; Pen & Connor 2015); (ii) Giant pulses (GPs) analogues emitted by young pul-
sars (Lundgren et al. 1995; Soglasnov et al. 2004; Popov & Stappers 2007), as discussed
by Cordes & Wasserman (2016); Connor et al. (2016b). Importantly, both scenarios imply
repetitiveness and FRBs relation to young neutron stars with particular properties – high
magnetic ﬁelds in the case of magnetars, or high spin-down energies in the case of GPs.
These two possibilities rely on diﬀerent source of energies for FRBs: strong magnetic ﬁelds
in case of magnetars and rotational energy in case of GPs.

Comparing properties of FRBs with the radio emission of magnetars and/or GPs can,
in principle, be used to favor one of the models, magnetically or rotationally powered, as we
discuss next. However, lack of understanding of mechanisms of radio emission from neutron
stars is a major impediment to this possibility (e.g. Melrose 1995; Lyutikov et al. 1999;
Melrose & Gedalin 1999; Beskin et al. 2015). Note, that coherent curvature emission by
bunches is not considered a viable emission mechanism (Melrose 1992; Melrose & Gedalin
1999).

2.1.2. Diﬀerent radio emission mechanisms

Let us brieﬂy outline our current understanding of the radio emission from neutron stars,

a long-standing problem in astrophysics. Qualitatively we can identify three types/mechanisms
of radio emission in neutron stars: (i) normal pulses, exempliﬁed by Crab precursor (com-
ing from opened ﬁeld lines, probably near the polar cap, having log-normal distribution in
ﬂuxes), see Moﬀett & Hankins (1996); (ii) GPs, exempliﬁed by Crab Main Pulses and Inter-
pulses (coming from outer magnetosphere, near the last closed ﬁeld lines; having power-law
distribution in ﬂuxes (Lundgren et al. 1995); possibly with a special subset of supergiant
pulses, see Mickaliger et al. (2012); sometimes GPs show narrow spectral structure, see Han-
kins & Eilek (2007); Lyutikov (2007); (iii) radio emission from magnetars (coming from the
region of close ﬁeld lines, variable on secular times scales and having very ﬂat spectra), e.g.
Camilo et al. (2006).

Though comparison of these general properties of pulsar radio emission with FRBs is

– 6 –

surely inconclusive, we favor the Giant Pulses model for the following reasons. (i) Similar
time scales of GPs and FRBs, when allowed for propagation broadening Champion et al.
(2015). (ii) Polarization: similar to FRBs (Petroﬀ et al. 2015a; Masui et al. 2015), GPs have
strong polarization signals (Soglasnov 2007), often switching between linear and circular
polarization.
(iii) Association of FRBs with rotationally powered GPs allows testiﬁable
predictions to be made, based on the possible scaling of the emitted intensity with the spin-
down power. (iv) non-detection of radio emission during SGR 1806-20 giant ﬂare (Tendulkar
et al. 2016) provides arguments against the magnetar association.
(However, note that
Tendulkar et al. 2016, searched only for simultaneous γ− and radio signals. If there is a
delay between them, then the argument is not applicable. Also, comparison with just one
burst of one SGR can be not very constraining for the whole population.)
(v) Though
the inferred ﬂatter spectra of FRBs (Keane et al. 2012) make them resemble magnetar
radio emission (Camilo et al. 2006), below we argue that this can be explained by the low
frequency free-free absorption. (vi) Possible narrow spectral features in FBRs (Spitler et al.
2016) resemble those seen in Crab GPs (Hankins & Eilek 2007).

3. The working model: giant pulses from young energetic pulsars

In the following we further discuss the possibility that FRBs are (super)-giant pulses

from energetic newborn pulsars.

3.1. DM, RM and free-free absorption from SNR

Given that the DM comes from the local environment (Masui et al. 2015) and that
FRBs are related to neutron stars, how the values of DM∼ hundreds can be achieved? Both
Galactic and intergalactic contributions to the DM from the distances of ≤ 100 Mpc is
expected to be typically ∼ tens. (High values of DM for some Galactic pulsars (Manchester
et al. 2005) is due to our location in the plane of the Galaxy and the fact that many pulsars
are located within the Galactic plane.) Typical values of DM of Galactic pulsars is ∼ tens
or hundreds (but normally below 375 – the lowest DM for FRBs). Thus, FRBs cannot come
from a general extragalactic pulsar population, but should come from a special sub-class.

A possible alternative, that we adopt as the main model, is that the DM comes from a
young SNR ejecta, i.e. from a dense shell around a newborn NS. Let us estimate the required
time scales. Let’s assume that a recent SN ejecta expelled mass Mej. If the size of the SN

So, the larger is the size, the smaller is the DM. For a given DM the size is

below the typical Galactic ﬁeld of µG. One possible explanation is that the magnetic ﬁeld
that produces the RM is conﬁned to the expanding envelope – it is then expected to be in
toroidal direction, perpendicular to the line of sight.

The free-free optical depth through an expanding SN shell is suﬃciently small at ∼ GHz

frequencies (Lang 1999, Eq. 1.223)

τ = 8 × 10−2n2ν−2.1rT −1.35 = 0.05 DM5/2

(13)
Note that the free-free optical depth becomes of the order of unity at frequencies ≤ 300 MHz.
This might explain the fact that low frequency observatories like LOFAR and MWA did not

frequency in the ejecta is ωp =(cid:112)4πne2/me = 106DM3/4

see FRBs (Karastergiou et al. 2015; Rowlinson et al. 2016), and that the lowest frequency
of FRB detection so far is 700MHz (Masui et al. 2015; Connor et al. 2016a). The plasma
375(Mej/M(cid:12))−1/4 rad s−1, so the source

is transparent to radio waves at ∼ 1 GHz.

We conclude that very young SNRs, at ages tens to hundreds of years can provide the

DM of the order of the observed values.

3.2. Pulsar physics

Above we have established that the observed properties of FRBs are consistent with SN
environment ∼ tens of years after the explosions. Next, let us discuss how pulsar physics
ﬁts with these estimates. We hypothesize that FRBs are rare (super)giant pulses-like events
whose luminosity LF RB scales with the spin-down power of a pulsar, LF RB = η ˙E, η (cid:28) 1 (we
note that this is not the case for the bulk of the pulsar population Manchester et al. 2005).

For Crab pulsar the peak GP ﬂuxes Sν exceed Mega-Janskys (Hankins et al. 2003;

Soglasnov 2007; Mickaliger et al. 2012). The corresponding instantaneous eﬃciency

where subscript NS refers to the magnetic ﬁeld on the surface, radius and period of Crab
pulsar. Since the GP duration is much smaller than the period, the average eﬃciency is much
smaller than (14) by ∆Ω/4π = (∆θ)2/4 ≈ few ×10−7 where ∆θ ≈ 2πτGP /PN S ≈ 10−3 is the
relative active phase of the GP, τGP ∼ few µsec is the GP duration. Thus, instantaneously,
pulsars GP luminosity can reach η ∼ few percent of the spin down power.

By analogy with Crab GPs we expect that the intrinsic FRB duration is smaller than the
neutron star spin. (FRB duration is consistent with δ-function pulse smeared by propagation
eﬀects, Champion et al. 2015.) Normalizing the FRB duration to the neutron star spin, the
required magnetic ﬁeld is

The magnetic ﬁeld (15) is somewhat larger than the typical ∼ 1012 G of young pulsars (recall
that this estimate uses the FRB duration as an estimate of the spin period, B ∝ τ 2), yet
it is well within the overall distribution of rotationally-powered pulsars, especially given the
uncertainties on other parameters. Also, if intrinsic duration of the FRB is much smaller than

the period, the estimate of the magnetic ﬁeld (15) decreases accordingly. The corresponding
spin-down time is

τSD =

d2FνµP 2 ∼ few years.

(The most important constraint in the above estimate comes from equating FRB duration
with the rotation period of a neutron star. Duration of GPs is typically much shorter that
the period.) Thus, if FRBs are powered by the rotation of a neutron star it is required that
(some fraction) of pulsars is born with millisecond periods (and normal magnetic ﬁelds).

Observationally, the initial periods of neutron stars are generally unknown (the fastest
young pulsar PSR J0537-6910 has 16 msec spin, Wang & Gotthelf 1998). The main way
to probe initial spin periods of NSs is to obtain an independent age estimate (a SNR age,
or a kinematic age, etc.) and to apply a usual magneto-dipole formula (with braking index
three). The largest set of such calculations for NSs in SNRs has been presented by Popov
& Turolla (2012). Despite, on average objects in this study appeared to have initial spin
periods ∼ 0.1 s, signiﬁcant fraction of analyzed sources can have very short initial periods.
Even if pulsars are born with millisecond periods (but “regular” magnetic ﬁelds of ∼ 1012
G) they are expected to quickly (within tens of years) spin down to periods larger than ∼ 10
msecs (Lorimer et al. 1993; Lai et al. 2001; Vink 2008). Atoyan (1999) did argue in favor
of fast initial spin in Crab. Theoretically, some simulations do predict rotation of neutron
stars with the spins in the millisecond range (e.g. Camelio et al. 2016).

We conclude that a population of young pulsars (ages tens to hundreds of years) with
magnetic ﬁelds typical of the observed population of young pulsars, but with spin periods
in the few millisecond range is a viable source of FRBs (see also Cordes & Wasserman 2016;
Connor et al. 2016b).

3.3. Frequency of occurrence

Let us do an estimate of the frequency of occurrence assuming that FRBs come from

young powerful neutron stars in the local universe, from distances d (cid:46) 100 Mpc.

Dahlen et al. (2012) estimate the core-collapse SN rate ∼ 3 × 10−4 yr−1 Mpc−3. Then
in 100 Mpc we expect ∼ 300 SN per year (or one per day). If we assume that all young
PSRs can produce strong bursts up to the age ∼ 30 yrs, then we have ∼ 104 such sources
inside 100 Mpc. To have a rate of few×103 FRBs per day, each pulsar needs to produce
one-two bursts per day, roughly consistent with current overall limits (Petroﬀ et al. 2015b).
If we slightly increase the limiting distance (say, up to 200 Mpc), then we can obtain a more
comfortable fraction (∼ 0.1) of young PSRs having large ˙E, and so producing strong bursts.

– 10 –

One can estimate the rate of supergiant pulses from a given pulsar following the data
given by Cordes & Wasserman (2016). The Crab pulsar produces GP with ﬂux ∼ 100 –
200 kJy once per hour (the brightest one is slightly than an order of magnitude more lumi-
nous). If we take a pulsar with the same ﬁeld but spin period (cid:46) 2 msec, then it has ˙E ∼ 105
times larger. So, we can expect from the same distance (2 kpc) ﬂux (1 - 2) × 1010 Jy. If we
now consider distances 100-200 Mpc, then the ﬂux is about few Jy. And the brightest —
about few tens of Jy. Well in the range of FRB ﬂuxes. Flux distribution for the Crab pulsar
is roughly ∝ S−3(Cordes & Wasserman 2016). I.e., much brighter bursts (for example, like
the Lorimer burst) might be rare – once in several months from the same source.

In the case of the repeating FRB 121102 (Spitler et al. 2016), the observed rate ∼ 3
hr−1 is high, but potentially consistent with expectations for young PSRs since most bursts
are of lower intensity, and some sources can be more active than average.

4. Expected statistical properties of FRBs

Currently, only a handful of FRBs is known (Petroﬀ et al. 2016). Let us now calculate
statistical properties of FBRs expected in our model, which can be later tested with larger
statistics. The key assumptions here is that the intrinsic luminosity of an FRB is proportional
to the spin-down power ˙E.

4.1.

Injected and observed distribution in spin-down energy f ( ˙E)

Let’s assume that pulsars are produced with a rate finj( ˙E) (per unit time, per unit
volume, per unit range of d ˙E). The Boltzmann equation for the evolution of the number
density f ( ˙E) reads

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

4.2. Observed distribution in ˙E: the inferred injection spectrum

As we discussed above, at high values of

˙E the observed and the injection spectra of
pulsars are related by Eqs. (21-22). The special case of β = 1 (same number of pulsars
˙E) is particularly interesting. Next, we demonstrate that the observed
born per decade of
distribution of high spin-down power pulsars is indeed consistent with such fairly ﬂat injection
spectrum.

We use the ATNF catalogue (Manchester et al. 2005) to obtain the ˙E distribution. Since
we are interested in young powerful pulsars, we use the high-energy tail of the distribution.
We made several diﬀerent radio pulsar samples from the ATNF catalogue to study the
˙E distribution. Two of them are shown in Fig. 1. Number distributions of pulsars per
logarithmic bin is typically roughly ∝ log ˙E−0.5 which corresponds to dN/d( ˙E) ∝ ˙E−1.5 (red
dashed curve in left panel of Fig. 1). For some samples, for example the sample of PSRs
with B > 1011 G, S1400 > 0.1 Jy and distances > 7 kpc (Fig. 1, right panel) a better ﬁt is
dN/d( ˙E) ∝ ˙E−1.4, still very close to the -3/2 law.

In addition, we analyzed period distribution of short period pulsars. Observed distri-
bution in P for short period pulsar (from ∼ 0.03 to ∼ 0.2 s) is f (P ) ∝ P 1/2. Though
this range of periods is also populated by older objects, it contains many young sources, in
correspondence with estimates by Popov & Turolla (2012). Thus, it can be used to estimate
the initial

˙E distribution.

Since for the simple magneto-dipole formula P ∝ ˙E−1/4 this translates to

This is suﬃciently close to the α = −3/2 law. Thus, we conclude that the observed dis-
tribution of fast pulsars is consistent with injection parameters β = 1, finj ∝ 1/ ˙E (equal

4.3. Homogeneous source distribution

We analyzed the observed Log N — Log Speak distribution of FRBs, Fig. 2, using the
FRB catalogue (Petroﬀ et al. 2016). If we exclude the brightest burst, the Lorimer burst, the
distribution is compatible with the isotropic −3/2 law, Fig. 2. In addition, the distribution
in Fobs for 13 dimmest sources has a very peculiar form:
it is linear in the linear scale.
However, statistics is low. Deviations from the 3/2 law are expected in radio surveys, since
the eﬀective area of the telescope beam is a strong function of ﬂux - super-bright sources
(like the Lorimer burst) can be found further away from the centre of the radio beam. This
biases the Log N – Log S towards ﬂatter apparent spectral distributions (Li et al. 2016,
also found ﬂatter distribution). In addition, low statistics seems to bias the Log N – Log
S distribution towards ﬂatter indices. We have performed a number of trials selecting 16
sources from various luminosity distributions and ﬁtting with the power-law. We notice that,
ﬁrst, for the small number of sources the average value of the power-law index was below
3/2 and, second, the standard deviation for 16 sources was σ ≈ 0.2. We conclude that the

observed distribution is consistent with homogeneous source distribution.

4.4. DM-peak ﬂux correlation

Combining expressions for DM (7) with spin-down power ( ˙E0 is the value at birth, τ is

the initial spin-down time)

we ﬁnd

(recall that we use ˙E as a proxy for peak luminosity). Thus, for times t (cid:28) τ , when ˙E ≈ ˙E0
we expect that DM is independent of the ˙E and, under assumptions of the model, of Speak.

catalogue Petroﬀ et al. 2016). The Lorimer burst (FRB 010724) is removed from the plot
as it is too bright in comparison with the others.

In Fig. 3 we plot the observed peak luminosity, Speak, and ﬂuence, Fobs, vs. dispersion
measure. Obviously, there is no strong dependence of Speak and Fobs on DM. By itself,
this behavior of DM excludes models in which dispersion measure is a proxy of distance
(as dispersion happens in the extragalactic medium) and bursts are more or less standard
candles.

4.5. Logarithmic injection in ˙E (β = 1): implications for the radial distribution

of brightest sources

The spin-down power distribution f ( ˙E) ∝ ˙E−3/2 is, in many respects, a special case:
the dipole spin-down law (with constant magnetic ﬁeld) singles out this solution as a special
one (this is a solution of a homogeneous Boltzmann equation for the pulsar ﬂow); also, it is
consistent with the observed spin-down distribution of fast pulsars (see §4.2). The observed
spectrum 3/2 implies, approximately, a special injection spectrum β = 1 – equal number of

FobsDM– 15 –

˙E. Next we calculate the expected observed properties of
newborn pulsars per decade of
FBRs for this special injection spectrum β = 1 (again, assuming that intrinsic brightness
correlates with spin-down luminosity).

First, we evaluate the expected distribution of distances for a given observed ﬂux. In
an unlimited volume the distribution of ﬂuxes follows the N (> S) ∝ S−3/2 law independent
of the intrinsic luminosity distribution. On the other hand, the distribution of sources
contributing a given ﬂux in distances depends on the intrinsic luminosity function. The
injection spectrum finj ∝ 1/ ˙E translates into steady state observed distribution (22) f ( ˙E) ∝
ln( ˙E0/ ˙E)/ ˙E3/2. Neglecting for a moment slowly varying logarithm, the case α = 3/2 turns
out to be an interesting special case: the distance to the nearest source is r ∼ f ( ˙E)−1/3 and
the observed ﬂux (again, assuming that FRB luminosity follows ˙E)

For f ( ˙E) ∝ ˙E−α this implies

S ∝ ˙E

r2 ∝ ˙E f ( ˙E)2/3

S ∝ ˙E(1−2α/3) ∝ r−2+3/α

(26)

(27)

So, for α < 3/2, S increases with r – the brightest sources are far away. For the special case
α = 3/2, the observed brightness is independent of the distances, S ∝ r0 ∝ ˙E0 (in a larger
volume there are brighter sources – this a variant of a so-called Malmqvist bias).

Thus, we expect that for the logarithmic injection spectrum, β = 1, at a given ﬂux the
observed sources are distributed over a wide range of distances. On a more subtle point, for
the logarithmic injection spectrum the expected ˙E distribution (22) diﬀers slightly from 3/2,
by a logarithm; thus we still expect that closer sources are brighter, yet the brightest sources
are distributed over a large distance. This is conﬁrmed by our Monte Carlo simulations
which we discuss next.

We conclude that for the injection spectrum finj ∝ 1/ ˙E the observed brightest sources
have very broad spacial distribution - the brightest one hundred sources (out of approximately
a million in the total sample) are located within ∼ a quarter of the test volume. This is
important: isotropy of FRBs imply that the brightest ones cannot come from nearby sources
— the local Universe is highly inhomogeneous on scales of tens of Mpc.

4.6. Monte-Carlo simulations of pulsars’ spin-down and observed brightness

distribution

To test the spatial distribution of the brightest sources we have conducted simulations
of pulsar population. First, to test the spacial distribution of brightest sources we injected

– 16 –

pulsars with the expected steady state distribution (22) over a range of distances. The results
are shown in Fig. 4. Importantly, this conﬁrms that brightest FRBs come from a wide range
of distances.

The brightest source are well ﬁtted with −3/2 spectrum (dashed line, ﬁtted slope 1.53).
Right panel. Radial distribution of the hundred brightest sources (out of total number of
approximately one million, located at normalized distances between 0 and 1). This plot
shows that the brightest sources are, generally, located in a broad range of distances.

Second, we did Monte Carlo runs injecting neutron stars by supernovae and following
subsequent spin down evolution. At each time step we redistribute homogeneously a number
of neutron stars in a volume 0 < r < 1 with initial distribution finj ∝ ˙E−1, 0.1 < ˙E < 1.
˙E ∝ − ˙E−3/2. The
Neutron stars spin down according to the magneto-dipole formula ∂t
observed FRB ﬂux is parametrized with spin-down luminosity, S ∝ ˙E/r2. Sources with
ﬂux below some minimal value are discarded. After suﬃciently large number of time steps
the total number of pulsars reaches statistical equilibrium. The distribution function f ( ˙E)
approaches the limit (22), Fig. 5, left panel, while the distribution of brightness approaches
−3/2 power law, Fig. 5, right panel

In conclusion, our MC simulations conﬁrm the analytical estimates: the spindown dis-
tribution follows (22), the brightest observed sources are distributed over a wide range of
distances, and, naturally, that the expected sources count follows N (> S) ∝ S−3/2.

5. Predictions

In this paper we argued that the physical constraints imposed by the properties of FRBs
limit their origin to the magnetospheres of neutron stars. Two special types could satisfy
those constraints: fast rotating young neutron stars (using the rotational energy to generate
FRBs), or very high magnetic ﬁelds neutron stars — magnetars (using the magnetic energy).
The key distinction between the two possibilities would be a detection of high energy emission
contemporaneous with an FRB — Crab giant pulses do not show high energy signals (Bilous
et al. 2012; Mickaliger et al. 2012; Aliu et al. 2012).

In this paper we discussed possible observational features of the GP-FRB association.
(i) Since we associate FRBs with recent core-collapse explosions, we expect that a SN might
have been detected years before the burst. We encourage observers to search in archives
for such correlations. (A possible exception to this could be alternative channels of neutron
starformation, like accretion-induced collapse (Nomoto & Kondo 1991); such events should
have low DMs. Magnetar activity is expected to be delayed from the formation of a neutron
star by corresponding Hall time, which can vary from years to millennia depending on the
location within the crust (Lyutikov 2015).) (ii) As we expect that distances are (cid:46) 100 –
200 Mpc, then it might be possible to identify the host galaxy, which will have signiﬁcant
star formation rate. (iii) We expect the repetition rate of FRBs of the order of one per
day per source. (iv) For a given FRB source the DM through a newly ejected SNR should
decrease with time (the repeating FRB 121102 did not show such a predicted behavior —

0.00.20.40.60.81.00.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5Log[E]Log[dN/dE]1.01.52.02.53.03.54.001234Log[S]Log[N(>S)]– 18 –

possible mitigating factors could be: large Galactic contribution, at least 30% but possibly
higher; older SN, few hundred years; possibly large contribution from the host galaxy (as
opposed to the surrounding SNR). At the same time the observed brightness might either
be independent of time and of the DM (if the observation time after a SN is shorter than
the initial spin-down time), or to decrease with time (if the observation time after a SN is
longer than the initial spin-down time). (v) True distances to FRB sources will show large
variations (not necessarily the closer – the brighter). (vi) Some pulsar are born with very
fast spins, of the order of few milliseconds. Most of the above predictions assume scaling of
intrinsic luminosity with the spin-down power.

f ( ˙E) distribution from f (B, P )

Let’s assume that at birth the distribution of magnetic ﬁelds and periods is f (B, P ).

We can parametrize the spin-down power as

(function Φ is proportional to the total electric potential).

We can introduce a coordinate Ψ orthogonal to the electric potential

see Fig. 6. (If magnetic ﬁeld remains constant and P0 and B0 are the initial values, a given
pulsar follows a line Ψ = (1 + Φ)/(2Φ) starting from a point Φ0 = 2 and Ψ0 = 3/4.)

For example, for a log-normal injection distribution in both magnetic ﬁeld and period,
