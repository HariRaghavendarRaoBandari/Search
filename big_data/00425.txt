We present measurements of the superconducting and charge density wave critical temperatures
(Tc and TCDW ) as a function of pressure in the transition metal dichalchogenides 2H-TaSe2 and
2H-TaS2. Resistance and susceptibility measurements show that Tc increases from temperatures
below 1 K up to 8.5 K at 9.5 GPa in 2H-TaS2 and 8.2 K at 23 GPa in 2H-TaSe2. We observe a kink
in the pressure dependence of TCDW at about 4 GPa that we attribute to the lock-in transition
from incommensurate CDW to commensurate CDW. Above this pressure, the commensurate TCDW
slowly decreases coexisting with superconductivity within our full pressure range.

INTRODUCTION

The near absence of reports on superconductivity in
graphene and related single layer systems is notorious,
given the large eﬀorts devoted presently to these mate-
rials. Only recently have superconducting signatures in
doped graphene sheets[1, 2] and Ising superconductivity
in trigonal prismatic monolayer MoS2[3, 5] and NbSe2
[4] been observed. Few-layer devices have been also
made of transition metal dichalcogenides (2H-TX2, with
T=Nb,Ta and X=S,Se), which crystallize in a hexagonal
arrangement of transition metal atoms separated by the
chalcogen. Single molecular layers, formed by hexago-
nal T-X groups, show opposing tendencies with decreas-
ing thickness—a reduction of superconducting Tc in 2H-
NbSe2 and an increase in 2H-TaS2[6–10].

Layered materials are generally very sensitive to mod-
iﬁcations of their lattice parameters[11–19]. To under-
stand their superconducting Tc, we need to address the
interplay between superconductivity and the charge den-
sity wave (CDW) and how this interplay evolves when
varying the lattice parameters.

It has been argued [11, 20] that superconductivity and
Initial discus-

CDW strongly interact in the 2H-TX2.

sions pointed out that there was a mutually exclusive
interaction.
Indeed, Tc decreases and TCDW increases
when the the lattice parameter a/c ratio decreases as
we pass from 2H-NbS2 (Tc = 6 K and TCDW = 0 K
), 2H-NbSe2 (Tc = 7.2 K and TCDW = 30 K), 2H-
TaS2 (Tc = 1 K and TCDW = 80 K) and 2H-TaSe2
(Tc = 0.1 K and TCDW = 120 K). On application of
pressure in 2H-NbSe2, the CDW disappears above 5 GPa
and Tc increases slightly up to 8.5 K at 10 GPa[12, 18],
pointing out an exclusive interaction too. Measurements
of the superconducting density of states and of vortex
core shapes in 2H-NbSe2 show that the superconducting
gap of 2H-NbSe2 is strongly shaped by the CDW and it
has been argued that the CDW decreases the gap value
along certain directions in real space[21]. Angular re-
solved photoemission also shows interesting correlations
between superconducting and CDW Fermi surface fea-
tures. If these are cooperative or exclusive is, however,
not clearly established when taking diﬀerent photoemis-
sion measurements into account[22, 23]. Thus, most ex-
periments point out that, particularly from data in 2H-
NbSe2, the interaction seems to be of competing nature.
Here we ﬁnd that, unexpectedly, CDW and superconduc-
tivity coexist in a large part of the phase diagram when

applying pressure to the Ta based 2H-TX2, namely 2H-
TaS2 and 2H-TaSe2.

In the compounds with largest interlayer separation
and highest CDW transition temperatures, 2H-TaS2 and
2H-TaSe2, the CDW and superconducting phase dia-
grams have been studied up to 4 GPa. The supercon-
ducting Tc increases in both compounds, up to about 2.5
K in 2H-TaS2 and 0.4 K in 2H-TaSe2[24]. In 2H-TaS2,
the resistivity vs temperature as a function of pressure
shows that the CDW appearing below 80 K at ambi-
ent pressure decreases down to about 66 K at 3.5 GPa
in 2H-TaS2[11, 25, 26]. In 2H-TaSe2, the ambient pres-
sure phase diagram consists of an incommensurate CDW
(ICDW) appearing at 120K and a lock-in transition at
90K to a commensurate CDW (CCDW). There is a reen-
trant lock-in transition with pressure[28]. The incom-
mensurate CDW occupies the whole temperature range
above 2 GPa, but, above 4 GPa, it locks to the lattice
and becomes again commensurate [28–33]. Here we study
the eﬀect of pressure up to 25GPa on superconductivity
and charge density waves in 2H-TaS2 and 2H-TaSe2 . We
ﬁnd that the CDW does not disappear up to the highest
pressures studied and that Tc increases considerably up
to close to 9 K in both compounds.

EXPERIMENTAL

To make a comparative study of both TCDW and
Tc under pressure we measure the magnetic suscepti-
bility and the resistivity of small samples. The sam-
ples were grown using vapour transport and the politype
purity of the 2H phase was checked by powder X-ray
diﬀraction[25]. To this end, samples of synthesized crys-
tals were ground and loaded inside a capillary ready for
powder X-Ray diﬀraction (performed in ambient condi-
tions). Indexation of the reﬂections of the powder pat-
tern by assuming a hexagonal symmetry allowed for the
identiﬁcation of a single phase with the following unit
cell parameters: a = b = 3.3137(2) ˚A, c = 12.076(1)
˚Afor 2H-TaS2 and a = b = 3.43910(5) ˚A, c = 12.7067(2)
˚Afor 2H-TaSe2. The Le Bail reﬁnement of the room tem-
perature powder pattern is in agreement with that de-
scribed for the 2H phases of TaS2 and TaSe2 crystals.
To measure the susceptibility, we use a diamond anvil
cell with a pressure transmitting medium of a methanol-
ethanol mixture (4:1), which is considered to yield quasi-
hydrostatic conditions up to the pressures of interest in
our experiment[18, 35]. Pressure was determined by the
ruby ﬂuorescence method [36]. We measure on small
single crystalline samples cut into parallelepipeds of size
about 100× 100× 30 µm3. The susceptibility is obtained
by a conventional AC method using a transformer and a
lock-in ampliﬁer[18]. For the resistance we use a Bridg-
man pressure cell with steatite as the pressure transmit-
ting medium [37]. Platinum wires were passed through

the pyrophillite gasket. Samples are cut into pieces of
approximate size of ∼100×400×60×µm3 and contacted
to the platinum leads in the pressure cell. The electrical
resistance measurements were performed using a Keith-
ley 220 source and a Keithley 2182 nanovoltmeter. Two
samples were measured simultaneously giving the same
results. We could not appropriately determine the vol-
ume of samples nor the geometrical factor. Thus, we
provide relative temperature variations of susceptibility
and resistance.

Fig. 1 displays the susceptibility and resistance ver-
sus temperature curves obtained at diﬀerent pressures
at low temperatures. We determine Tc from the onset
of the superconducting resistive and magnetic transition
curves, deﬁned as the intersection of two tangents, one to
the ﬂat portion of the curve above and the second to the
steepest variation in the signal below the superconduct-
ing transition. In all cases we obtain sharp transitions,
providing an unambiguous determination of the super-
conducting Tc. Sometimes, we observe in the resistance
measurements a small non-zero residual value in the su-
perconducting phase, which we attribute to two contacts
touching each other at one side of the sample in the pres-
sure cell. This does not inﬂuence the determination of
Tc.

RESULTS

The evolution of TCDW under pressure was deter-
mined by calculating the temperature derivative of the
resistance, dR(T )/dT , from the measured resistance vs
temperature curves . In Fig. 2, we show dR(T )/dT for
diﬀerent pressures. The development of the CDW pro-
duces a gap on the Fermi surface that causes a sudden
increase in the resistance which induces a downward peak
in dR(T )/dT [38]. Their position in the curves are sig-
nalled on Fig 2 by small arrows. The obtained pressure
dependence of Tc and TCDW is shown in Fig. 3.

In 2H-TaSe2, we ﬁnd that pressure provokes an in-
crease of Tc, with a slope of 0.58 K/GPa, between 2
and 8 GPa. The maximum is attained at Tc = 8.2 K
at the pressure of 23 GPa. On the other hand, TCDW ,
which signals, as discussed above, an ICDW transition,
decreases slowly to about 4 GPa. At 4 GPa we observe
a jump. On further compression, TCDW continues its
rather slow decrease reaching a value of ∼ 90K at 20GPa.

2H-TaS2 shows a similar behavior. We ﬁnd an initial
slope dTc/dP = 1.05 K/GPa below 6 GPa, which then
slows down to 0.45 K/GPa, between 6 and 9.5 GPa. At
low pressure, TCDW decreases slowly, similarly to previ-
ous results[25] . At 4 GPa we observe a sharp jump, sim-
ilar to the one observed in 2H-TaSe2. Above the jump,
TCDW continues its slow decrease down to ∼ 40K at
17GPa.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Within the well-proven Bilbro-McMillan approach[39],
the SC involves the portion of carriers which are not
gapped by CDW, explaining their mutual competition.
In quasi-1D systems, CDW’s are originated by strong
nesting of the parallel FS. Application of pressure de-
stroys the CDW at a critical pressure Pc, where Tc at-
tains its maximum value[40–43]. While the loss of Fermi
surface portions due to nesting dominates the interplay
between CDW and superconductivity in quasi-1D sys-
tems, the situation is more involved in quasi-2D systems.
Due to the quasi-cylindrical nature of the 2D FS’s, the
nesting anomalies are much weaker[44] and then electron-
phonon coupling is more important in creating CDWs
than in quasi-1D systems [30, 45–49]. The interplay be-
tween competing electronic and elastic degrees of freedom
produces then minima in the free energy landscape that

easily favor diﬀerent kinds of CDW (commensurate or
incommensurate) when modifying pressure and temper-
ature.

For 2H-TaSe2, the jump in TCDW observed at about
4 GPa agrees with the previously reported pressure in-
duced lock-in transition into a CCDW[28] (right green
line in Fig. 3). Such a peak in the variation of density
wave transition temperatures with pressure has been ob-
served in other materials [51, 52] and have been unequivo-
cally ascribed to transitions from an incommensurate to a
commensurate state. McMillan explained the ﬁrst order
nature of the incommensurate / commensurate transition
temperature driven by a Ginzburg Landau analysis [50].
By analogy, we expect that the pressure driven incom-
mensurate/commensurate transition is also a ﬁrst order
transition and induce a jump in the TCDW (P) phase di-
agram.

The behaviour at ambient pressure for both com-
pounds is similar. At high temperature they show a
transition to an ICDW, with a lock-in transition to an
CCDW at lower temperatures [26–28]. We can then spec-
ulate that the jump around 4GPa in both 2H-TaSe2 and
2H-TaS2 are due to the same phenomenon. That would
imply that the ICDW in 2H-TaS2 locks to the lattice
with increasing pressure. We include this possibility in
the proposed general phase diagram shown in the insert
of Fig. 3.

The weak pressure dependence of TCDW at higher
pressures indicates, on the other hand, that the CDW
in this pressure range is remarkably robust to a reduc-
tion of the lattice parameters. This is not possible to ex-
plain within a pure nesting scenario, because band struc-
ture and the nesting condition are extremely sensitive to
pressure. On other hand, in the simplest lattice sce-
nario through an e-ph coupling, theories have to recon-
cile the absence of pressure dependence of TCDW with
the phonons hardening due to pressure.

It is interesting to discuss a recent model pro-
posed to explain the CDW in the 2H transition metal
dichalcogenides[53]. It considers that the CDW transi-
tion takes the form of a phase transition in a system of
interacting Ising pseudo-spins. These can be associated
to the six transition metal atoms lying on the vertices of
the in-plane hexagon described in Ref. [46]. These might
have a tendency to cluster in such a way as to form an
inverse-star towards the transition metal atom at the cen-
ter of the hexagon. This type of distortion has locally an
intrinsic degeneracy, i.e. the transition metal atoms can
choose between two inverse-stars with the same type of
displacement. By analogy with an up and down Ising
ferromagnet, this is called a Ising pseudo-spin model.
Thus, order is only short ranged and the development
of a macroscopic static distortion corresponds to an or-
dering of the Ising pseudo spins[54]. This order-disorder
transition is characterized by the absence of unstable zero
energy phonon softening at the transition, as is conﬁrmed

4

by the reported non-zero soft mode for 2H-TaSe2[34] .
Furthermore, the idea of pre-existing disordered defor-
mations stems from the observation of a gap 5 times
larger than the expected from weak-coupling formula[55]
and could be used to explain the robustness of the CDW
at the higher pressures.
It would imply, though, that
the model describes better the transition metal dichalco-
genides with large interlayer separation, 2H-TaSe2 and
2H-TaS2, than 2H-NbSe2.
In the latter compound the
CDW has a lower critical temperature (30 K) and disap-
pears already at 5 GPa[12, 14].

Regarding the superconductivity, our measurements
show that Tc is strongly enhanced within the commensu-
rate high pressure CDW phase. The increase in Tc might
be a consequence of phonon hardening or of Fermi surface
induced changes with pressure. But it is not straightfor-
ward to think of a scenario where such features act on
superconductivity independently to the CDW. A possi-
bility is that both phenomena involve widely diﬀerent
parts of the Fermi surface associated to the absence or
small interband correlations.

It is interesting to note that the extrapolation of the
low pressure (below the jump) behavior of the ICDW
up to higher pressures using a mean ﬁeld approach

ICDW is the ambi-
ent pressure ICDW transition) leads to values for T 0
ICDW
becoming zero at a pressure Pc roughly when the Tc(P )
curve ceases to increase in both materials. In the past, a
mean ﬁeld power law has been used for the low pressure
commensurate transition in 2H-TaSe2 [29, 56]. We have
tentantively highlighted this aspect in the inset of Fig. 3.
Although the extrapolation is, of course, connected with
very large errors, it invites the speculation that there
might be a mutually exclusive relation between incom-
mensurate CDW and superconductivity. Note, however,
that the Bilbro-McMillan approach discussed above in
relation with the competition between incommensurate
CDW and superconductivity does no longer apply when
the incommensurate CDW has passed a transition into a
commensurate CDW.

It is worth to note that the phase diagrams of 2H Ta-
based dichalcogenides are in sharp contrast from that of
other transition metal dichalcogenides such as 1T-TiSe2,
where superconductivity is observed at the vicinity of the
pressure range of ICDW [17, 57] or 2H-NbSe2, where Tc is
only moderately aﬀected by the pressure[12, 18]. In this
last compound, the insensitivity of the superconducting
critical temperature to the CDW transition is due to the
fact that high energy optical phonon modes have a strong
contribution to the Eliashberg function, whereas the low-
energy longitudinal acoustic mode that drives the CDW
transition barely contributes to superconductivity[58].

We conclude that understanding the value of Tc in lay-
ered materials requires studying modiﬁcations of band-
structure, phonon dispersion and electron phonon cou-

pling. Here we have shown that Tc can considerably
increase within a CDW, by more than an order of mag-
nitude.
