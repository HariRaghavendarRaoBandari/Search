The 2D redshift-space power spectrum is affected at the level of ∼ 6% at k⊥
but for k⊥ 6 0.4h Mpc−1 the amplitude differs by less than 1%. We report vanishingly small
baryonic velocity bias for haloes: the peculiar velocities of haloes with M200 > 3 × 1011M⊙
(hosting galaxies with M∗ > 109M⊙) are affected at the level of at most 1 km/s, which is
negligible for 1%-precision cosmology. We caution that since EAGLE overestimates cluster
gas fractions it may also underestimate the impact of baryons, particularly for the total matter
power spectrum. Nevertheless, our ﬁndings suggest that for theoretical modelling of redshift
space distortions and galaxy velocity-based statistics, baryons and their back-reaction can be
safely ignored at the current level of observational accuracy. However, we conﬁrm that the
modelling of the total matter power spectrum in weak lensing studies needs to include re-
alistic galaxy formation physics in order to achieve the accuracy required in the precision
cosmology era.

1 INTRODUCTION

The standard hierarchical structure formation theory assumes that
the distribution of mass in the Universe has evolved out of pri-
mordial post-inﬂationary Gaussian density and velocity perturba-
tions via gravitational instability. The resulting large-scale struc-
tures can be described in a statistical way. Two-point statistics
(power spectrum and correlation function) are the most widely
studied measures (see e.g. Peebles 1980; Juszkiewicz & Bouchet
1995; Percival et al. 2001; Gazta˜naga et al. 2002; Cole et al. 2005;
Eisenstein et al. 2005). With the advent of precision cosmology, de-
ﬁned here as a level of one percent precision in cosmic observables,
it is a matter of utmost relevance to obtain accurate theoretical esti-
mates of the two-point statistics. Theoretical modelling is needed to

assess and model the systematic effects present in cosmic observ-
ables. This modelling needs to be precise enough to reduce the im-
pact of the systematic effects below that of the expected statistical
errors. So far the common approach has been to use large computer
N-body simulations of a collisionsless dark matter (DM) ﬂuid (see
e.g. Frenk & White 2012, for an extensive review), to model the
cosmic density and velocity ﬁelds. DM only simulations are rela-
tively simple and cheap in terms of computer resources. However,
they treat the baryonic component in a simpliﬁed manner, mod-
elling it as dark and pressureless. In the light of the accuracy re-
quired by precision cosmology this approach might well turn out
to be inadequate for accurate modelling of all relevant systematic
effects.

In linear theory baryons follow the gravitational evolution of
dark matter, which dominates the gravitational potential on large
scales (i.e. tens of Megaparsecs). However, on smaller scales the

highly non-linear nature of the physical processes that govern
galaxy formation can lead to signiﬁcant displacement of the bary-
onic components relative to the underlying DM (e.g. Jing et al.
2006; Rudd et al. 2008; Guillet et al. 2010; van Daalen et al. 2011;
Velliscig et al. 2014; van Daalen et al. 2014; Mohammed et al.
2014). On those smaller scales, we can distinguish two different
regimes. The ﬁrst one concerns scales to hundreds of kiloparsecs,
where owing to radiative cooling, gravitationally preheated gas can
efﬁciently dissipate internal energy and condense into halo cen-
tres reaching densities much higher than those of the accompa-
nying DM. This effect boosts the variance of the baryon density
ﬁeld w.r.t that of the DM by 10-20% on scales < 500h−1 kpc
(e.g. van Daalen et al. 2011), (hereafter VD11). The second one
is connected to the very energetic processes of Supernovae (SN)
explosions and other stellar feedback events, as well as feedback
from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These feedback processes can
eject signiﬁcant amounts of gas from the galaxies and haloes in
which they reside. Especially efﬁcient AGN energy feedback leads
to expulsion of gas from the high-redshift progenitors of today’s
group and cluster sized haloes beyond their z = 0 virial radii.
Simulations require such energetic feedback to match simultane-
ously optical and X-ray observations of galaxy groups and clus-
ters (e.g. McCarthy et al. 2010; Fabjan et al. 2010; McCarthy et al.
2011). Hence SN and AGN feedback yield smoother baryon den-
sity contrasts on scales up to a few Megaparsecs (e.g.VD11;
Puchwein & Springel 2013; Vogelsberger et al. 2014).

We expect

that on small and intermediate scales (i.e.<
∼
20h−1 Mpc), the distribution of baryonic matter could differ sig-
niﬁcantly from that of the collisonless component and that this
will produce a back-reaction onto the dark matter (e.g.VD11). This
back-reaction, in turn, can produce non-negligible effects in the
DM distribution on galactic and intergalactic scales. The baryonic
back-reaction may also affect the velocity ﬁelds of DM, haloes and
galaxies. While these baryonic effects on the total and dark mat-
ter density ﬁelds have been studied in previous works, the impact
on the cosmic velocity ﬁelds of DM and galaxies remains to be
investigated. Accurate modelling of this phenomenon is important
since extraction of cosmological information from galaxy redshift
surveys requires precise modelling of the galaxy and DM peculiar
velocity ﬁelds.

Our aim in this study is to assess the scale and size of the
baryonic back-reaction on both the cosmic density and velocity
ﬁelds of DM and galaxies. We will do this by analysing the state-
of-the-art galaxy formation simulation EAGLE (Schaye et al. 2015;
Crain et al. 2015).

2 THE EAGLE SIMULATION SUITE

In this letter, we use the main simulation (Ref-L100N1504, here-
after EAGLE) of the EAGLE (Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies
and their Environments, Schaye et al. (2015))
suite and its DM
only version (hereafter DMO) that was run from the same initial
conditions. This was achieved by increasing the DM particle mass
by a factor of (1 − fb)−1 (here fb ≡ Ωb/Ωm is the universal
baryon fraction). EAGLE uses a state-of-the-art set of subgrid mod-
els and treatment of smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The sim-
ulations assumes a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology with parameters from
Planck2013 (Planck Collaboration et al. 2014). The initial condi-
tions are generated at z = 127 using second-order Lagrangian per-
turbation theory in a 1003 Mpc3 volume with a DM particle mass
of 9.7 × 106 M⊙ and initial gas particle mass of 1.8 × 106 M⊙

(Jenkins 2013). The particles are then evolved in time using a mod-
iﬁed version of the GADGET Tree-SPH code (Springel 2005) that
includes the pressure-entropy formulation of the SPH equations by
Hopkins (2013) and other improvements whose effects on the re-
sulting galaxy population are discussed by Schaller et al. (2015c).
The maximum physical Plummer-equivalent gravitational soften-
ing is ǫ = 700 pc.

The subgrid model

in this simulation includes element-
by-element radiative cooling (Wiersma et al. 2009a), a star for-
mation recipe designed to reproduce the observed Kennicutt-
Schmidt relation (Schaye & Dalla Vecchia 2008), chemical en-
richment via stellar mass loss (Wiersma et al. 2009b), stellar
feedback (Dalla Vecchia & Schaye 2012), gas accretion onto su-
permassive black holes and the corresponding AGN feedback
(Booth & Schaye 2009; Rosas-Guevara et al. 2015). The free pa-
rameters in the subgrid model have been calibrated to match the
masses and sizes of galaxies in the local Universe as well as the
relation between galaxy mass and supermassive black hole mass
at z = 0. The simulation has been shown to reproduce broadly
a variety of other observables such as the Tully-Fisher relation
and speciﬁc star formation rates (Schaye et al. 2015), the H2 and
H I properties of galaxies (Lagos et al. 2015; Bah´e et al. 2016),
the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and galaxy sizes
(Furlong et al. 2015), the column density distribution of intergalac-
tic metals (Schaye et al. 2015) and H I (Rahmati et al. 2015) as
well as galaxy rotation curves (Schaller et al. 2015a) and colours
(Trayford et al. 2015). With all these successes it is worth men-
tioning here also a signiﬁcant shortcoming of the simulation.
The EAGLE X-ray properties of groups and clusters presented
in Schaye et al. (2015) compares rather poorly with observations,
with EAGLE predicting too high gas fractions in those objects.
While Schaye et al. (2015) have shown that EAGLE model AG-
NdT9 (which uses more efﬁcient AGN feedback) does much bet-
ter, its box size of 50 Mpc is too small for our purposes. This dis-
crepancy is important in assesing the prominence of the baryonic
effects at intergalactic scales, as the gas fraction of massive ob-
jects is a sensitive telltale sign of the strength of baryonic effects
on the corresponding scales (see e.g. Semboloni et al. 2011, 2013).
This should borne this in mind when we analyse the magnitude and
scales of the bayonic effects onto the matter spectrum in EAGLE
simulation.

3 BARYONIC EFFECTS

We consider basic two-point statistics of the cosmic density and
velocity ﬁelds in the form of power spectra. Speciﬁcally, we ex-
amine the real-space total and DM power spectra of density ﬂuc-
tuations, P (k) ≡ hδkδ∗
ki, the power spectrum of the scaled
velocity divergence (expansion scalar), Pθθ(k) ≡ hθkθ∗
ki, de-
ﬁned here as θk ≡ ∇ · ~v(~k)/aHf. The corresponding density-
velocity cross-power spectrum is Pδθ(k) ≡ hδkθ∗
ki, and the
full two-dimensional redshift space density power spectrum is
l (|~k|)Pl(cos |~k|/kk), with monopole mo-
P s(k⊥, kk) = P∞
0 (k)l=0. Here ~k is the comoving 3D Fourier mode
ment, P s
wavevector, ~v is the peculiar velocity, a is the cosmic scale fac-
tor, H is the Hubble parameter, f is the growth rate of den-
sity ﬂuctuations (deﬁned as the logarithmic derivative of the den-
sity perturbation growing mode with respect to the scale fac-
tor), and ﬁnally Pl are Legendre polynomials. For all calcula-
tions in redshift space we use the distant observer approxima-
tion in which the z-axis of the simulation cube is parallel to the

l=0 P s

observer’s line of sight (k-direction) and the x, y-axes form a
plane perpendicular to the observer’s direction (⊥-direction). To
compute the power spectra, we estimate the density and veloc-
ity ﬁelds using the Delaunay Tesselation Field Estimator method
of Schaap & van de Weygaert (2000), implemented in the pub-
licly available
code by Cautun & van de Weygaert (2011). The
DTFE method gives a volume-weighted velocity ﬁeld and has a self-
adaptive smoothing kernel that follows the local density of tracers.
For 1D spectra we sample the ﬁelds onto a 10243 cubic grid
and for 3D spectra we use a 5123 sampling grid. The size of the
sampling grids implies Nyquist limits for the spectra of k1024
N yq =
N yq = 24.1h Mpc−1 respectively. The anal-
48.2h Mpc−1 and k512
ysis of lower-resolution runs of EAGLE indicates that the power
spectra are converged to 1% at kN yq/8. However, since we are fo-
cused here on relative differences between DMO and EAGLE, we
will consider the power spectra up to their respective Nyquist sam-
pling limits.

In Fig. 1 we plot all relevant EAGLE one dimensional power
spectra as absolute values of their relative differences with respect
to the corresponding DMO power spectra. For all cases the dashed
lines mark the results when the EAGLE amplitude is higher than
the DMO case, whilst the solid lines correspond to the opposite.
We ﬁrst focus on the total matter power spectrum (orange line).
Theoretical predictions of this statistic up to k ∼ 5h Mpc−1 are
needed for precision cosmology with upcoming surveys like Euclid
(Laureijs et al. 2011) and LSST (Ivezic et al. 2008). The simula-
tion suggests that at k = 5h Mpc−1 baryons already produce a 5%
difference in the amplitude. This effect is much more pronounced
when we consider even smaller scales: at k ∼ 10 − 20h Mpc−1
the difference between DMO and EAGLE can be as large as 10 −
20%. The results are compared with two of the OWLS models
(Schaye et al. 2010) analysed by VD11. Our results fall in between
VD11 REF model (which had no AGN feedback; tan line) and their
AGN model (with strong AGN feedback; magenta).

We evaluate the amplitude and scales on which the back-
reaction of baryons affects the DM by studying the blue line in
Fig. 1, which shows that on scales k > 5h Mpc−1 the back-
reaction effects are much smaller (less than 6 4%) than the bary-
onic effects we have seen in the total matter power spectrum.
This indicates that on those scales the effect of baryons on the
total matter power spectrum is dominated by the distribution of
the baryons themselves. Interestingly, in the transitional regime of
1 6 k/(h Mpc−1) 6 5, the differences between the DMO power
spectrum and the DM component of EAGLE are typically as large as
∼ 3%. This is greater than the differences we observe in the total
matter P (k). Consequently, even though in this regime the effect
of baryons on the total matter power sepctrum is small, DM only
simulations will still fail to accurately predict the power spectrum
of the DM component.

The effects that we have observed here for the DM and baryon
density ﬁelds are not surprising, considering all the non-linear and
highly energetic processes modelled by the EAGLE simulation. The
question that we now want to answer is: to what extent and on what
scales does the non-linear physics of the baryonic back-reaction in-
duce changes on the velocity ﬁeld? We can do this by analysing
the red line in the right panel of Fig. 1. This line depicts the ab-
solute difference between the amplitude of the DM velocity di-
vergence power spectrum – Pθθ(k), and that of the correspond-
ing DMOsimulation. The absolute difference is smaller than 3% in
the range 1 6 k/(h Mpc−1) 6 10. At larger scales the differ-
ence quickly drops below 1% and at k ∼ 0.3h Mpc−1 it already
becomes negligibly small (< 10−3). Qualitatively and quantita-

tively similar behaviour is observed for the density-velocity cross-
power spectrum, where differences at k < 10h Mpc−1 are usu-
ally smaller than those in Pθθ. In the case of the monopole of the
redshift space power spectrum, P0(k), the difference between EA-
GLE DM and the DMO result attains its maximal value of ∼ 4% at
k = 4h Mpc−1; however, the baryonic back-reaction drops below
1% already for wavenumbers smaller than 0.5h Mpc−1.

Fig. 2 compares the full two-dimensional redshift and real
space EAGLE DM and DMO power spectra. For clarity we plot only
isoamplitude contours and apply the transformation k⊥ → −k⊥
for the conﬁguration space P s(k⊥, kk). The EAGLE box size is
probably too small to allow for a proper modelling of large-scale
modes (k < 0.1h Mpc−1) and the Kaiser effect (Kaiser 1987)
due to ﬁnite volume effects (see Colombi et al. 1994). However, the
box is sufﬁciently large to assess the impact of galaxy formation on
smaller scales, where the “Fingers of God” effect distorts the matter
power spectrum amplitude. The isoamplitude contours are system-
atically shifted to higher k⊥ values for EAGLE , hence indicating
that the back-reaction of baryons on the DM leads to a slightly
weaker suppression of small-scale power due to viralised motions
inside clusters and groups of galaxies. This effect is noticeable
DM O/P s − 1|
only for k⊥
can typically be as large as 6%. At smaller separations the effect
quickly falls below 1% at k⊥ = 0.4h Mpc−1. We will discuss
the implications of our ﬁndings concerning the back-reaction of
baryons onto the DM density and velocity power spectra in the dis-
cussion section.

So far, with the exception of the total matter power spectrum,
we have focused on statistics derived from the velocities and po-
sitions of DM particles in our simulations. These are not accessi-
ble with astronomical observations but are used in theoretical mod-
elling. However EAGLE also provides catalogues of galaxies and
the haloes they inhabit. This allows us to compare the peculiar
velocities1 of haloes in the DMO and EAGLE runs. By measuring
these differences we can assess the extent to which DMO simu-
lations will suffer from halo and galaxy velocity bias induced by
ignoring baryons and their back-reaction onto the DM and galaxy
velocity ﬁeld. Since baryonic physics affects the virial masses of
haloes (e.g. Sawala et al. 2013), comparing haloes at ﬁxed masses
will suffer from the additional trend induced by the changes in halo
mass. To reduce this additional scatter, we ﬁrst match haloes be-
tween both runs, following the method of Velliscig et al. (2014).
For each halo in the EAGLE run we ﬁnd its unique counterpart in
the DMO run by identifying the structure that contains the majority
of its 50 most bound particles. The same is done for the DMO halos
and only pairs that can be matched bijectively between the two sim-
ulations are kept in the catalogue (see also Schaller et al. 2015a).
Having matched halo pairs between the two simulations, we com-
pute the difference between their respective peculiar velocities and
average this quantity in bins of both EAGLE halo virial2 and galaxy
stellar mass. We ﬁnd that the averaged peculiar velocity difference
is smaller than 1 km/s for haloes with M200 > 3 × 1011M⊙,
hosting galaxies with M⋆ > 1 × 109M⊙. For haloes with galax-
ies more massive than M⋆ > 3.5 × 1010M⊙ the offset between
the DMO and EAGLE halo peculiar velocities is consistent with

ity as the velocity of its most bound DM particle.
2 For the virial mass we use M200, i.e.
the mass contained in a sphere of
radius r200 centred on a halo, such that the average overdensity inside the
sphere is 200 times the critical closure density, ρc.

zero. For all haloes the average difference is much smaller than
the average difference in the peculiar velocity of matched DM par-
ticles, which is ∼ −4 km/s (i.e. DM particles in the full hydro
run have smaller velocities). van Daalen et al. (2014) have demon-
strated that the difference in the two-point correlation function of
matched haloes in the DMONLY and OWLS AGN simulations is
negligible on scales larger than the virial radius of the haloes. In
addition Schaller et al. (2015b) have shown that vast majority of
EAGLE galaxies show an offset between their luminous and dark
matter component that is smaller than the force resolution of the
simulation. A negligible effect on halo and galaxy velocities, that
we ﬁnd in EAGLE, is thus consistent with their ﬁndings, as any long-
lasting difference in halo velocity would produce a signiﬁcant po-
sition displacement over a Hubble time.

4 DISCUSSION

We have measured and analysed systematic differences in the DM
density, velocity and redshift space power spectra between the full
EAGLE run and its dark matter only version at redshift z = 0. The
EAGLE galaxy formation model employs subgrid level modelling
of radiative cooling (including metals), chemical evolution, star for-
mation, supermassive black hole, and energetic feedback from star
formation and AGN. The EAGLE model of galaxy formation repro-
duces many properties of the galaxy population which suggests that
the galaxy formation implementation is plausible in the sense that
it does not invoke unreasonably strong or weak feedback from star
formation and AGN. This is important as the work of VD11 showed
that these two processes mainly modulate the scale and strength of
the baryonic back-reaction onto the dark matter. However, recall-
ing that EAGLE overestimates the gas fraction in massive objects,
we can treat the results shown here as an approximate lower bound
on the magnitude of the baryonic inﬂuence on the DM.

Our ﬁndings imply that accurate modelling of hydrodynamical
and galaxy formation physics is essential to predict the total mat-
ter P (k) on scales corresponding to wavenumbers k ∼ 4h Mpc−1
to better than 1% accuracy. On larger scales baryonic effects in
EAGLE change the amplitude by less than 1%, while on scales of
k ∼ (3−6)h Mpc−1 the change is greater than 10%. This is a large
number in the context of theoretical modelling of the total mat-
ter power spectrum from weak lensing tomography in forthcoming
surveys such as Euclid or LSST (e.g. Hearin et al. 2012). We stress
that EAGLE is expected to underestimate baryonic effects since the
cluster gas fractions are signiﬁcantly too low (Schaye et al. 2015).
This may explain the quantitative difference with VD11, who found
a 1% effect for k > 0.3h Mpc−1 for the OWLS model AGN
(Schaye et al. 2010) which does reproduce the observed gas frac-
tions (McCarthy et al. 2010).

The amplitude of the power spectrum of the DMO model devi-
ates by ∼ 3% from the scaled DM component of the full EAGLE run
on scales of 1 <
∼ 5. This indicates that colision-
less simulations fail to model the distribution of the DM component

∼ k/(h Mpc−1) <

precisely. This was to some extent already present in the results of
Schaller et al. (2015a), who found that the DM density proﬁles of
haloes that contain EAGLE galaxies deviate from their DMO coun-
terparts. Our results indicate that the DM distribution beyond the
virial radii of haloes can also be signiﬁcantly affected by the bary-
onic back-reaction.

The impact of baryons on the DM peculiar velocity ﬁeld is
less pronounced than on the density ﬁeld, but it extents to some-
what larger scales. Nevertheless, the effect seen in our simulations
∼ 0.5h Mpc−1. This shows that bary-
is less than 1% on scales k <
onic effects connected to the galaxy formation physics are not cru-
cial to build accurate models of redshift spaces distortions, pro-
vided that these models are restricted to sufﬁciently large scales.
Since theoretical models of the shape and amplitude of the DM
Pθθ(k) and Pδθ are the main ingredients of redshift space distor-
tions models (e.g. Kaiser 1987; Scoccimarro 2004; Taruya et al.
2010; de la Torre & Guzzo 2012), it was important to assess the
magnitude and scales at which the baryonic physics affects the ex-
pansion scalar power spectrum.

The impact of baryons on the peculiar motions of haloes and
galaxies is even smaller. This implies that baryonic effects are neg-
ligible in the modelling of the large-scale velocity ﬁeld of galaxies
and haloes. This is important because a number of velocity-based
observables have been proposed to constrain cosmological param-
eters and models (see e.g. Nusser & Davis 1994; Strauss & Willick
1995; Nusser et al. 2012; Tully et al. 2013; Hellwing et al. 2014;
Koda et al. 2014).

To conclude, our results suggest that DM only simulations
may be sufﬁciently accurate to model the cosmic peculiar velocity
ﬁeld of haloes, galaxies and dark matter. However, baryonic effects
are important and need to be taken into account in order to attain
the required accuracy of the total-matter and DM power spectra
demanded by future surveys like Euclid or LSST.
