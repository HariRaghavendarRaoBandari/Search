Abstract

This is the ﬁrst publication in which an ill-posed Cauchy problem for a quasi-
linear PDE is solved numerically by a rigorous method. More precisely, we solve
the side Cauchy problem for a 1-d quasilinear parabolc equation. The key idea is
to minimize a strictly convex cost functional with the Carleman Weight Function
in it. Previous publications about numerical solutions of ill-posed Cauchy problems
were considering only linear equations.

Key Words: Ill-posed Cauchy problem, quasilinear parabolic PDE, numerical solu-

tion, Carleman weight function

Introduction

This is the ﬁrst publication in which an ill-posed Cauchy problem for a quasilinear PDE is
solved numerically by a rigorous method. This is done for a 1d quasilinear parabolic equa-
tion with the lateral Cauchy data given on one edge of the interval. Initial condition is
unknown. We implement numerically the idea of the paper [24] of the ﬁrst author. It was
proposed in [24] to construct globally strictly convex weighted Tikhonov-like functional

1

with Carleman Weight Functions (CWFs) in them. In particular, we demonstrate nu-
merically here that the presence of the CWF signiﬁcantly improves the solution accuracy
even in the case of the linear PDE ut = uxx.

The topic of numerical solutions of ill-posed Cauchy problems for PDEs is very popular
in the ﬁeld of ill-posed problems. As some examples, we refer to, e.g.
[1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 20, 23, 26, 30] and there are many more publications on this topic.
However, all those works consider only linear PDEs. Even though the paper [1] considers
a quasilinear equation, in fact that equation can be reduced to a linear one via a change
of variables. Two natural questions therefore are:

1. Is it possible to develop a numerical method for ill-posed Cauchy problems for

nonlinear PDEs?

2. Can the method of item 1 deliver at least one point in a suﬃciently small neighbor-
hood of the exact solution, provided that no information about this neighborhood
would be given in advance?

These two questions were addressed positively in the paper [24] of the ﬁrst author. This
was done for those quasilinear PDEs of the second order, whose principal parts of operators
are linear and admit Carleman estimates. In other words, those are parabolic, elliptic
and hyperbolic quasilinear PDEs with linear principal parts of their operators. However,
numerical experiments were not a part of [24]. So, the current paper complements [24] in
this sense.

Similar ill-posed Cauchy problems for linear parabolic PDEs were considered in, e.g.
Ideas, similar to the one of this paper, were applied in works of the
[4, 8, 9, 10, 20].
ﬁrst author with coauthors [3, 19, 22, 25]. In these works globally strictly convex cost
functionals for Coeﬃcient Inverse Problems (CIPs) were constructed. Furthermore, the
publication [22] contains numerical results for the 1-d case.

For the ﬁrst time, the method of Carleman estimates was introduced in the ﬁeld of
inverse problems in the paper of Bukhgeim and Klibanov [6] in 1981. The goal of the
publication [6] was to apply Carleman estimates for proofs of uniqueness and stability
results for CIPs. The idea of [6] became quite popular since then with many publications
of a number of authors. Since this is not a survey of that method, we refer here to only
a limited number of publications [2, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 32, 33]. In particular, papers
[21, 33] are surveys.

In section 2 we formulate the problem, describe our numerical method and also formu-
late some relevant theorems. In sections 3 and 3 we prove Theorems 1 and 2 respectively.
In section 5 we describe our numerical implementation and in section 6 we present our
numerical results.

2 Statement of the Problem and the Numerical Method

A general statement of the ill-posed Cauchy problem considered here can be found in [24].
The same about some theorems below, which can be formulated in more general forms.
However, since we consider only the 1-d case here, we formulate our problems and results
for this case only: for brevity.

Uniqueness and existence theorems for this problem are well known, see, e.g. the book
of Ladyzhenskaya, Solonnikov and Ural’ceva [27]. So, we assume that there exists unique
of the problem (2.1)-(2.3). Our interest is in the following ill-posed

Cauchy problem:

Ill-Posed Cauchy Problem 1. Suppose that functions f (x) and g (t) are unknown
whereas the function p (t) is known. Also, assume that the following function q (t) is
known

ux (1, t) = q (t) , t ∈ (−T, T ) .

(2.4)

Determine the function u (x, t) in at least a subdomain of the time cylinder Q±
T .

Uniqueness of the solution of this problem follows immediately from the well known
uniqueness theorem for a general parabolic PDE of the second order with the lateral
Cauchy data, see, e.g. Chapter 4 of [29].

2.2 Numerical method

Following [24], we introduce the Carleman estimates ﬁrst. This estimate is diﬀerent from
the one of [24], since the CWF depends on two large parameters, instead of just one here.
As a result, that CWF decays too rapidly. So, we have discovered in our computations
that the rate of decay of that CWF is inconvenient for the numerical implementation. Let
λ > 0 be a large positive parameter. Consider functions ψ (x, t) and ϕλ (x, t) deﬁned as

ϕλ (x, t) = exp(cid:2)λ(cid:0)x2 − t2(cid:1)(cid:3) .

In principle the convergence of the gradient method is known in the case when its start-
ing point is located in a small neighborhood of the minimizer. However, the main point of
Theorem 3 is that due to the strict convexity of the functional Jλ,β (u) on the set B (R) , the
sequence (2.19) converges to the unique minimizer starting from an arbitrary point u1 ∈
B (R). Since no restrictions are imposed on the number R, then this is the global conver-
gence.
We now reformulate theorems 2.1-2.3 of [24] for our case. Since the function P ∈

We now construct the gradient method of the minimization of the functional (2.16) on
the set B (R). For brevity we consider only the simplest version of that method. Consider
an arbitrary point u1 ∈ B (R). Let γ > 0 be the step size of the gradient method. Then

is unique on B (R) . Assume that the sequence {un}∞
n=1 ⊂ B (R) , where u1 is an arbitrary
point of B (R) . Then there exists a suﬃciently small number γ = γ (λ, β, α0, M, R, T ) ∈

The minimizer umin ∈ B (R) is called the “regularized solution” in the regularization
theory [2, 31]. The next natural question is about the convergence of regularized solutions
to the exact solution. We now modify the material of pages 6,7 of [24], where this question
was addressed for a general case. In accordance with the Tikhonov concept for ill-posed

problems [2, 31], we assume that there exists an exact solution u∗ ∈ H 3(cid:0)Q±

(cid:1) of our

problem with noiseless data p∗ (t) and q∗ (t) . In other words, we assume the there exists
the solution u∗ (x, t) of the following problem

As to the functions p and q in (2.3) and (2.4), we assume p, q ∈ H 3 (−T, T ) and that they
are given with an error of the level δ, i.e.

Next, following [24], we construct functions F, F ∗ ∈ H 3(cid:0)Q±

(cid:107)p − p∗(cid:107)H 3(−T,T ) ≤ δ,(cid:107)q − q∗(cid:107)H 3(−T,T ) ≤ δ.

Hence,

F (1, t) = p (t) , Fx (1, t) = q (t) , F ∗ (1, t) = p∗ (t) , F ∗

x (1, t) = q∗ (t) ,

as it is required in [24]. Furthermore, (2.23) and (2.24) imply the following analog of the
estimate (2.29) in [24] is valid

(cid:107)F − F ∗(cid:107)H 3(Q±

T ) ≤ Cδ.

(x2 − t2) = 1.

We now can formulate Theorem 4 about the convergence of regularized solutions. This
theorem is a direct analog of Theorem 2.3 of [24]. To be in the agreement with (2.13) of
[24], we note that maxQ

Theorem 4. Let conditions of Theorems 2, 3 hold. Let the function u∗ be the solution
of the problem (2.20)-(2.22). Assume that inequalities (2.23) are valid. Let the parameter
λ1 be the same as in Theorem 2. Then there exists a number λ2 = λ2 (α0, M, R, T, ε) ≥ λ1
and the number C2 = C2 (α0, M, R, T, ε) > 0, both depending only on listed parameters,

such that if the number δ0 ∈(cid:0)0, e−4λ2(cid:1) , then for all λ ≥ λ2, δ ∈ (0, δ0) , β ∈(cid:0)e−λε, 1(cid:1) the

T ) .

Even though the convergence here is in a subdomain of the domain Q±

T , this seems
to be suﬃcient for computations. The combination of Theorems 2,3,4 addresses two
questions posed in the beginning of section 1. Now about proofs of above theorems. As
to Theorem 1, it is known from the survey of Yamamoto [33]. However, since a general
parabolic operator of the second order is considered in [33], we prove this theorem below
for our speciﬁc operator c (x, t) ∂t − ∂2
x: for the sake of completeness. As to Theorem 2, it
is a direct analog of theorem 2.1 of [24]. However, there is an important diﬀerence too.
The domain of integration in [24] is Gα. On the other hand, it is more convenient for
computations to integrate over the entire rectangle Q±
T as in (2.15). This means that the
we need to prove Theorem 2. We do not prove Theorem 3 here, since its direct analog
was proved in [3]. Also, we do not prove Theorem 4 below, since its direct analogs were
proved in [3] and [24].

Denote w (x, t) = v (x, t) exp [λ (x2 − t2)] . Then v = w exp [−λ (x2 − t2)] . Express deriva-
tives of v via derivatives of w. We obtain

In this proof C1 = C1 (α0, M, R) > 0 denotes diﬀerent constants depending only on listed

f (y + z) = f (y) + f(cid:48) (y) z +

f(cid:48)(cid:48) (ξ) ,∀y, z ∈ R,

(4.1)
where the number ξ is located between numbers y and y + z. Let u1, u2 ∈ B (R) be two
arbitrary functions. Let h = u2 − u1. Then u2 = u1 + h and (2.13)-(2.15) imply that

Consider the expression for A (u1 + h) = A (u2) , where the operator A is deﬁned in (2.12).

(4.3)

= A0 (u1) + A0 (h) − P (u1x + hx, u1 + h, x, t) .

We now work with the term P (u1x + hx, u1 + h, x, t) in (4.3). Using (2.17) and (4.1), we
obtain in a standard manner

P (u1x, u1, x, t) + hx∂uxP (u1x, u1, x, t) + h∂uP (u1x, u1, x, t) +(cid:101)P (u1x, u1, hx, h, x, t) , (4.4)

5 Numerical Implementation

5.1 The forward problem
Recall that Q±
considered the following forward problem:

1/2 = {(x, t) : x ∈ (0, 1) , t ∈ (−1/2, 1/2)} . For our numerical testing we have

ut = uxx + aS (u) + F (x, t) , (x, t) ∈ Q±
1/2,

u (x,−1/2) = f (x) ,

u (0, t) = g (t) ,

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)
In (5.1) the number a = const. ≥ 0 characterizes the degree of the nonlinearity. For
example, a = 0 corresponds to the linear case. We have chosen two functions S (u) in our
numerical tests. Our speciﬁc functions in (5.1)-(5.4) were:

u (1, t) = p (t) .

S1 (u) = sin2 (u) , S2 (u) = exp (0.4u) ,

F (x, t) = 10 sin(cid:2)100(cid:0)(x − 0.5)2 + t2(cid:1)(cid:3) ,

f (x) = 10(cid:0)x − x2(cid:1) ,

g (t) = 10 sin [10 (t − 0.5) (t + 0.5)] , p (t) = sin [10 (t + 0.5)] .

Graphs of functions F, f, g, p are presented on Figure 1. Thus, solving the forward
problem (5.1)-(5.4) for the input functions (5.5)-(5.8), we have computed the function
qcomp (t) ,

ux (1, t) = qcomp (t) , t ∈ (−1/2, 1/2) .

We now formulate precisely the ill-posed Cauchy problem which we have solved compu-
tationally.
Ill-Posed Cauchy Problem 2. Suppose that in (5.1)-(5.4) functions f (x) and g (t)
are unknown whereas the functions F (x, t) p (t), S (u) and the constant a ≥ 0 are known.
Suppose that in the data simulation process functions F, S, f, g, p are the same as in (5.5)-
(5.8). Determine the function u (x, t) in at least a subdomain of the time cylinder Q±
assuming that the function qcomp (t) in (5.9) is known.

j = f (3) (tj) . Let ϕij = aS (uij) + Fij. We have

5.2 Specifying the functional Jλ,β

In the case of (5.1)-(5.9) the operator A becomes

K (u) = ut − uxx − aS (u) − F (x, t) .

(5.10)

We have dropped here the multiplier e−2λ(α0+ε) which was present in the original version
(2.16). Indeed, we have used this multiplier above in order to allow the parameter β to

be less than 1. However, we have discovered in our computations that the accuracy of
results does not change much for β varying in a large interval. The norm (cid:107)u(cid:107)
(cid:17) due to the convenience of computations. Note that since we
H 3(cid:16)
taken instead of (cid:107)u(cid:107)
do not use too many grid points when discretizing the functional Jλ,β (u) , then these two
norms are basically equivalent in our computations, since all norms in a ﬁnite dimensional
space are equivalent.

5.3 The discrete form of Jλ,β

In our computations we represent derivatives in (5.10) in the form of ﬁnite diﬀerences
with N = 32, M = 128 and minimize the resulting functional with respect to values of
the function u at grid points. Discretizing integrals, we obtain the following discrete form

In (5.15) and (5.16) we use boundary conditions (5.4) and (5.9) at x = 1 as

(5.17)

5.4 Some notes about noisy data and the conjugate gradient

method

In all our numerical experiments β = 0.00063. As we have stated in subsection 5.2, we have
observed in our computations that this parameter does not inﬂuence much our results.
All results below are obtained for noisy data with 5% level of noise. Here is how we have
introduced this noise. Let σ ∈ [−1, 1] be the random variable representing the white noise.

13

Let p(m) = maxj |pj| and q(m) = maxj |qcomp,j| . Then by (5.17) the noisy data, which we

have used, were(cid:101)uN−1j = pj + 0.05p(m)σj,(cid:101)uN−2j = pj − h(cid:0)qcomp,j + 0.05q(m)σj

(cid:1) .

(5.18)

In all our numerical tests we have used in (5.11) M = 32, N = 128. Even though these
numbers are the same as in the solution of the forward problem, the “inverse crime” was
not committed since we have used noisy data and since we have used the minimization
of the functional (5.11) rather than solving a forward problem again. To minimize the
functional, we have used the unconstrained CGM. We arrange this method in such a
way that boundary conditions (5.18) are kept to be satisﬁed on all iterations. So, we
minimize the functional (5.11) with respect to numbers {uij}(N−3,M−3)
. However, numbers

uN−1j, uN−2j are kept as (5.18). As the starting vector(cid:8)u0
 0 if i ∈ [0, N − 3] ,
(cid:101)uN−2j if i = N − 2,
(cid:101)uN−1j if i = N − 1.

u0
ij =

ij

(cid:9) we take

(i,j)=(2,2)

(5.19)

Normally, for a quadratic functional this method reaches its minimum after M · N
gradient steps with the automatic step choice. However, our computational experience
tells us that we can obtain a better accuracy if using a small constant step in the GCM
and a constant number of iterations. Thus, we have used the step size γ = 10−8 and 10,000
iterations of the GCM. It took 0.5 minutes of CPU Intel Core i7 to do these iterations.

6 Numerical Results

Let u (x, t) be the numerical solution of the forward problem (5.1)-(5.3). Let uλβ (x, t) be
the minimizer of the functional (5.11) which we have found via GCM. Of course, u (x, t)
and uλβ (x, t) here are discrete functions deﬁned on the above grid and norms used below
are discrete norms. For each x from this grid we deﬁne the “line error” E (x) as

E (x) =

(cid:107)uλβ (x, t) − u (x, t)(cid:107)L2(−1/2,1/2)

(cid:107)u (x, t)(cid:107)L2(−1/2,1/2)

.

(6.1)

We evaluate how the line error changes with the change of x. Since our lateral data are
given at x = 1, it is anticipated that the function E (x) should be decreasing.

We have tested three values of the parameter λ : λ = 0, 3, 4. We have found that λ = 4
is the best choice, at least for those problems which we have studied. Also, we have tested
two values of the parameter a in (5.1): a = 0 and a = 10. The case a = 0 corresponds to
the linear problem and a = 10 indicates the nonlinearity.

6.1 Graphs of line errors

Graphs of the line error are presented on Figure 2. Figure 2a corresponds to the linear case
with a = 0. Figures 2b and 2c with a = 10 display the line errors for two above functions
S (u) . Figure 2b is for S (u) = sin2 (u) and Figure 2c is for S (u) = exp (0.4u) . One can
observe that for both values λ = 3 and λ = 4 all three cases have an acceptable error

14

up to x = 0.45. In other words, the function u (x, t) is reconstructed rather accurately on
more than half of the interval [0, 1]: for x ∈ [0.45, 1] . Thus, in all cases the presence of
the CWF signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy of the solution. Furthermore, the presence
of the CWF improves the accuracy even in the linear case.

The case a = 0, λ = 0 corresponds to the Quasi-Reversibility Method, which was
ﬁrst introduced by Lattes and Lions [28]. This method works only for linear PDEs.
The convergence rate of this method can be established via Carleman estimates, see
[4, 5, 7, 8, 20] and the recent survey [23].

S (u) = sin2 (u) . c) a = 10, λ = 0, 3, 4 and S (u) = exp (0.4u) . Thus, in all cases the
presence of the CWF in the functional (5.11) signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy of the
solution. Furthermore, the presence of the CWF improves the accuracy even in the linear
case. In all cases a rather accurate reconstruction is obtained for x ∈ [0.45, 1] , i.e. on
more than half of the interval [0, 1] .

15

6.2 Graphs of functions uλβ (0.6, t)

As one can see on Figures 2 a)-c), the line error at x = 0.6 is about 10% for λ = 0, 4
for all three cases. Thus, we have decided to superimpose graphs of functions uλβ (0.6, t)
with graphs of functions u (0.6, t) . One can see on Figures 3a)-c) that graphs of functions
u0β (0.6, t) are rather far from the graph of functions u (0.6, t) . On the other hand, the
presence of the CWF in the functional (5.11) makes graphs of functions u4β (0.6, t) to be
quite close to the graph functions u (0.6, t) . This is true even for the linear case of Figure
3a). On the other hand, functions u0β (0.6, t) and u4β (0.6, t) drop to zero as t → −1/2+.
Also, the accuracy at t ≈ 1/2 is not good on Figures 3a),b). We explain this by condition
In addition, in the accuracy estimates (2.25), (2.26)
(5.14) which we have imposed.
Gα0+2ε ∩ {t = ±1/2} = ∅.

solution in all three cases, including even the linear case.

To see how the knowledge of the initial condition u (x,−1/2) = f (x) aﬀects the accuracy
of our results, we have tested the case when the function f (x) in (5.7) is known. Now
we arrange the GCM in such a way that both boundary conditions (5.18) and the initial
condition ui0 = fi are kept be satisﬁed on all iterations. Similarly with (5.19) the ﬁrst

guess(cid:8)u0

(cid:9) is taken as

ij



u0
ij =

0 if i ∈ [0, N − 3] , j (cid:54)= 0,

(cid:101)uN−2j if i = N − 2, j (cid:54)= 0,
(cid:101)uN−1j if i = N − 1, j (cid:54)= 0,

fi if j = 0.

Here we consider the case a = 10, S (u) = sin2 (u) . Figure 4a) displays the line errors
with and without knowledge of the function f (x) in (5.7). One can see that for x ∈ [0.45, 1]
the error for the case when f (x) is known is less than for the case when f (x) is unknown.
Figure 4b) displays graphs of functions u4β (0.6, t) for the cases of known and unknown
initial condition. They are superimposed with the graph of the function u (0.6, t) . One
can observe that these three graphs are only slightly diﬀerent from each other on the
major part of the time interval. Figure 4c) displays graphs of functions u4β (0.8, t) for the
cases of known and unknown initial condition. They are superimposed with the graph of
the function u (0.8, t) . One can see that these graphs almost coincide, except of t ≈ −1/2.
Thus, the knowledge of the initial condition does not provide an essential impact in the
accuracy of the solution.
