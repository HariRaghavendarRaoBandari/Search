Abstract

The eﬀect of noise on various protocols of secure quantum communication has been studied. Speciﬁcally, we have
investigated the eﬀect of amplitude damping, phase damping, squeezed generalized amplitude damping, Pauli type
as well as various collective noise models on the protocols of quantum key distribution, quantum key agreement,
quantum secure direct quantum communication and quantum dialogue. From each type of protocol of secure quantum
communication, we have chosen two protocols for our comparative study; one based on single qubit states and the
other one on entangled states. The comparative study reported here has revealed that single-qubit-based schemes are
generally found to perform better in the presence of amplitude damping, phase damping, squeezed generalized amplitude
damping noises, while entanglement-based protocols turn out to be preferable in the presence of collective noises. It is
also observed that the eﬀect of noise entirely depends upon the number of rounds of quantum communication involved
in a scheme of quantum communication. Further, it is observed that squeezing, a completely quantum mechanical
resource present in the squeezed generalized amplitude channel, can be used in a beneﬁcial way as it may yield higher
ﬁdelity compared to the corresponding zero squeezing case.

Introduction

In 1984, Bennett and Brassard proposed the ﬁrst protocol for quantum key distribution (QKD) which is now known as
BB84 protocol [1]. This pioneering work drew a considerable amount of attention from the scientiﬁc community, as it was
shown to be able to provide unconditional security, a desired feature for all key distribution schemes, but unachievable in
the domain of classical cryptography. The fact that unconditional security can be provided if we use quantum resources
for key distribution led to extensive studies on the protocols of secure quantum communication (see Ref. [2] for further
details). Initial studies were limited to QKD [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]. These initial studies on QKD brought out a number of facts
which were further established later. Here, in the context of the present work, we wish to specially stress on a speciﬁc
aspect. In 1991, Ekert proposed a protocol for QKD using entangled state which can be reduced to BB84 protocol (which
uses single photon (qubit) states) under certain conditions [4]. Later, Bennett introduced a single-photon-based scheme
for QKD which requires only 2 states, now known as the B92 protocol [3]. Soon BBM protocol [5] was introduced, and
it was found that BBM protocol may be viewed as an entangled-state-based analogue of the single-photon-based B92
protocol. Thus, these studies indicated that the security achieved by a single-photon-based scheme can also be achieved
by a corresponding entangled-state-based scheme. As we have already mentioned, initial studies on quantum cryptography
were limited to QKD [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Later on, several other aspects of secure quantum communication were investigated.
For example, protocols were proposed for quantum secret sharing [7], quantum key agreement (QKA) [8, 9, 10], quantum
dialogue (QD) [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) [16, 17], and deterministic secure
quantum communication (DSQC) [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. For the purpose of the present study, all these schemes
of secure quantum communication can be broadly divided in two classes: Class A: single-qubit-based schemes which do
not use entangled states to implement the protocol, like BB84 protocol [1], B92 protocol [3], LM05 protocol [17], and
Class B: entangled-state-based protocols, which uses one or more entangled states to implement the protocol. Ekert
protocol [4], BBM protocol [5], ping-pong (PP) protocol [16], are some of the protocols belonging to Class B. In fact, there
exists a one to one map between the protocols of Class A and Class B. In principle, any task that can be implemented
using single qubit states can also be implemented using an entangled-state-based scheme. Of course, device independent
schemes can be realized only using the protocols of Class B. However, we do not wish to stress on that feature (device

independence) here. Excluding ideas of device independence, it can be shown that the security provided by a scheme
of Class A and the corresponding scheme of Class B is equivalent in the ideal situation, where noise is not present. To
illustrate this point in Table 1, we have listed protocols of Class A and Class B for various tasks related to secure quantum
communication. As we have already mentioned in an ideal situation, these schemes (i.e., any two schemes shown in the
same row of Table 1) are equivalent as far as the ability to perform the cryptographic task in a secure manner is concerned.
However, to the best of our knowledge this equivalence is not investigated in the realistic situation (i.e., in the presence
of noise). Keeping this fact in mind, this paper aims to perform a comparative study of the protocols for secure quantum
communication under various noise models. Speciﬁcally, we wish to compare single-qubit-based protocols (protocols of
Class A) with entangled-state-based protocols (Protocol of Class B) under various noise models. Here, it may be noted
that although, such comparative study has not yet been performed for protocols of Class A and Class B mentioned above,
a similar comparative study has been performed on conjugate-coding-based protocols of secure quantum communication
and orthogonal-state-based protocols of secure quantum communication, which are equivalent in the ideal situation ([26]
and references therein), but not in noisy environment ([27] and references therein). Further, there are various equivalent
but diﬀerent decoy-qubit-based strategies (such as the BB84 subroutine, GV subroutine) for eavesdropping checking that
are used in standard protocols of secure quantum communication. These subroutines are also known to be equivalent in
a noise free environment, but a recent study has established that they are not equivalent in a noisy environment [27].
This recent observation has further motivated us to perform the present investigation and to systematically investigate
the eﬀect of diﬀerent type of noises on various type of schemes of secure quantum communication.

There are several noise models [28, 29]. Here, we will restrict ourselves to the study of the eﬀects of amplitude damping
(AD) channel, phase damping (PD) channel [30, 31], collective noise and Pauli noise. Finally, we will also discuss squeezed
generalized amplitude damping (SGAD) channel [31, 32, 33] and note that results for the generalized amplitude damping
(GAD) channel as well as that for the AD channel can be obtained from the results computed for the SGAD channel. The
motivation to study these noise models is that the AD noise model deals with an interaction of the quantum system with
a zero temperature (vacuum) bath. An energy dissipation is involved in this noise model while not in PD. These two noise
models can bring about the phenomena of entanglement decay and entanglement sudden-death [34]. Here, as we wish
to analyze the equivalence between a single-qubit-based scheme with an entanglement-based one, these two noise models
become relevant. Collective noise is a coherent eﬀect on all the qubits, viz., all the polarization encoded photons traveling
through an optical ﬁber undergo the same birefringence [35]. The Pauli noise channels include various physically relevant
cases, such as bit ﬂip, phase ﬂip, and depolarizing channels [31, 36, 37, 38]. SGAD channels are a generalization of the
AD family of channels, which includes the GAD and involves the dissipative interaction with a non-zero temperature bath
with non-vanishing squeezing [32]. The squeezing, being a quantum resource, provides an edge over GAD channels, which
study a dissipative interaction with a ﬁnite temperature bath without squeezing [39, 40, 41]. Hence, the choice of SGAD
channel enables investigations into both non-zero as well as vanishing regimes of squeezing. The wide applicability of all
these noise models sets our motivation to systematically study various schemes for secure quantum communication under
noisy environment and to analyze their equivalence.

The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we brieﬂy discuss the noise models we are going
to apply on the schemes mentioned in Table 1. The next section is dedicated to the method adopted to study the eﬀect
of noise models described in Section 2. In Section 4, we brieﬂy describe the protocols listed in Table 1, and report the
eﬀect of various type of noises on these protocols with a clear aim to compare single-qubit-based scheme for a speciﬁc
cryptographic task with the corresponding entangled-state-based scheme. Finally, we conclude in Section 5.

2 Diﬀerent noise models

The most important and widely studied noise models are the AD, PD, collective and Pauli noise models. Apart from
these, generalization of AD considering a dissipative interaction with a thermal and squeezed thermal bath have been

2

studied as GAD and SGAD, respectively. Here, we describe only the SGAD channels as the eﬀect of the GAD channel can
be obtained as its limiting case for zero bath squeezing. Further, as the AD noise is a limiting case of GAD, it provides
a consistency check of the obtained results under SGAD noise. In what follows, we will study the eﬀect of all these noise
models on the protocols of secure quantum communication that are listed in Table 1. The noise models we have opted to
study in the present paper are brieﬂy described below.

2.1 AD noise model

The AD noise simulates the dissipative interaction of a quantum system with a vacuum bath. A perception about the
importance of this noise model can be obtained easily if we consider the large number of theoretical and experimental
works on this noise model reported in the recent past ([27, 34, 40, 42, 43, 44] and references therein). The Kraus operators
of an AD channel are given by [28, 29, 32]

E0 = (cid:20) 1

0

0 √1 − η (cid:21) ,

E1 = (cid:20) 0 √η

0 (cid:21) ,

0

where η (0 ≤ η ≤ 1) is the probability of error or decoherence rate.

2.2 PD noise model

Similarly, Kraus operators for phase-damping noise model are [28, 29, 31]

E0 = p1 − η(cid:20) 1 0

0 1 (cid:21) ,

E1 = √η(cid:20) 1

0

0

0 (cid:21) ,

E2 = √η(cid:20) 0 0

0 1 (cid:21) ,

(1)

(2)

where η (0 ≤ η ≤ 1) is the decoherence rate. This is another widely studied noise model. For instance, PD noise is
discussed in Refs. ([27, 31, 33, 34, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47] and references therein). This noise model is also experimentally
simulated in Refs. [43, 44].

2.3 Collective noises

A coherent eﬀect of environment on all the travel qubits passing through a channel [48] can be studied using collective
rotation (CR) and dephasing (CD) noise models. It is known that the singlet states are resistant to an arbitrary collective
noise [48]. Recently, the eﬀect of collective noise on various schemes of quantum communication has been studied [15, 27,
35, 49, 50, 51]. Interestingly, these studies provided protocols for quantum communication, which use logical qubits to
avoid the eﬀect of collective noise (cf. [15, 50, 51]). Before we proceed further let us brieﬂy introduce CR and CD noise
models.

2.3.1 CR noise model

CR noise transforms |0i → cos θ |0i+sin θ |1i and |1i → − sin θ |0i+cos θ |1i. Here, θ is the noise parameter [27, 49, 50, 51].
Mathematically, a rotation operator acts on the quantum state of travel qubits corresponding to this transformation.

2.3.2 CD noise model

CD noise leaves |0i unchanged while transforms |1i as |1i → exp (iφ)|1i, where φ is the noise parameter [27, 49, 50, 51].
This is equivalent to a phase gate.

2.4 Pauli noise

The set of all Pauli channels is a tetrahedron. The phase ﬂip and phase damping channels correspond to a proper subset
of the Pauli channels. Depolarizing channels forms a 1-simplex embedded within the convex polytope representing the
Pauli channels [31]. Pauli noise [31] is studied using operators Ei = √piσi, where σ0 = I, σ1 = X, σ2 = iY , and σ3 = Z.
Here, pi corresponds to the probability with which a particular Pauli operation is applied [36, 37, 38]. Corresponding
expression for the depolarizing channel can be obtained with pi = p′
3 for i ∈ {1, 2, 3} and p0 = 1 − p′. Speciﬁcally, it
would mean that with a certain probability the state remains unchanged while with the remaining probability, it becomes
completely mixed. Further, information regarding bit ﬂip, phase ﬂip and bit-phase ﬂip channels can be obtained with
p0 = 1 − p′ and pi = p′ for i = 1, 3 and 2, respectively. This kind of noise channel is studied for noise estimation [36],
channel characterization [37] and error correction [38].

SGAD channel is a generalization of the AD and GAD channels and is characterized by the following Kraus operators

squeezing angle. The analytic expression for the parameter Q is quite involved, and can be obtained from Ref. [32]. The
beauty of SGAD channel is that for zero bath squeezing (Φ), it reduces to GAD channel, which can further be reduced to
zero temperature bath (AD channel), where Q becomes 1. Hereafter, we will avoid the time t in the argument of all the
expressions under SGAD noise for simplicity of notations. Quasiprobability distributions and tomogram of the single and
two qubit spin states under the SGAD channels have been studied recently in [40, 41]. The inﬂuence of SGAD noise on a
quantum cryptographic switch was analyzed in [39].

3 Strategy for studying the eﬀect of various noise models on the protocols

of secure quantum communication

The eﬀect of noise can be studied by using a distance-based measure, ﬁdelity, between the ﬁnal quantum state expected
in the absence of noise and the ﬁnal state obtained when one of the noise models discussed above is considered. To be
precise, the strategy adopted in Ref. [27, 45, 47] will be used here. Before we discuss various protocols of secure quantum
communication and the eﬀect of noise on them, we will brieﬂy summarize the strategy adopted for the task.

Consider an initial pure state ρ = |ψihψ| which is to be evolved under a noisy environment. The evolution of the state
EiρE†i , where Eis are the Kraus operators
after applying the Kraus operators characterizing a particular noise is ρk = Σ
i
for the chosen noise model under consideration. Speciﬁcally, the Kraus operators of AD, PD, SGAD and Pauli channels
are given in Section 2.

Further, in case of the coherent eﬀect of noise on all the qubits, i.e., collective noise, the transformed state is obtained
as ρk = U ρU†, where U is the unitary operation due to corresponding noise. The unitary operations for both collective
noises are given in the previous section.

Finally, ﬁdelity, deﬁned as

between the ﬁnal state after the eﬀect of noise ρk and pure initial state |ψi is used as a measure of the eﬀect of noise. It
would be worth mentioning here that the ﬁdelity expression used here has been used in Refs. ([27, 52, 53] and references
therein). However, conventionally, an equivalent, but a slightly diﬀerent deﬁnition of ﬁdelity is used, and ﬁdelity for two

F = hψ|ρk|ψi,

quantum states ρ and σ is deﬁned as F (σ, ρ) = T rqσ

1

2 ρσ

2 .

In the current study, we have assumed that one of the noise models is studied at a time. Further, we have also
considered that only the travel qubits are aﬀected by the environment, while the qubits not traveling through the channel,
i.e., home qubits remain unaﬀected.

4 Various aspects (protocols) of secure quantum communication and eﬀect

of noise on them

We brieﬂy review two protocols for each type of secure quantum communication task (namely, QKD, QKA, QSDC and
QD), and study the eﬀect of the above described noise models on them. For this we chose one protocol from Class A

4

and another one from Class B. Speciﬁcally, for a cryptographic task listed in the second column of Table 1, a protocol
from Class A (B) is mentioned in the third (fourth) column. Here, we aim to compare the protocol mentioned in the
third column of Table 1 with the protocol mentioned in the fourth column of the same row under diﬀerent type of noise
models. The purpose, is to investigate their equivalence when subjected to diﬀerent noise models discussed in Section 2.
Speciﬁcally, the strategy mentioned in the previous section is used here to perform the comparison by comparing ﬁdelity.
We obtain expressions of ﬁdelity for the quantum states to be recovered at the end of each protocol. Further, we would
like to mention that all the ﬁdelity expressions reported here are obtained as an average ﬁdelity for all possible choices of
initial states and encoding on them. For example, if we consider Ba An protocol of QD where a predecided entangled state
is used as initial state, then there will be 16 possible cases as Alice and Bob each can encode messages using 4 diﬀerent
operations. Similarly, for a single-qubit-based QD scheme there are 16 possible cases with 4 initial states and 2 possible
encodings by each party. This is why for each type of QD average ﬁdelity is obtained by computing ﬁdelity for all cases
and then averaging. A similar approach is adopted in the rest of the paper to obtain average ﬁdelity for various protocols.

4.1 QKD protocols and eﬀect of noise on them

Here, as we compare a single-qubit-based scheme for QKD with a QKD scheme which requires an entangled state.
Speciﬁcally, we opt for B92 protocol [3] as an example of single-qubit-based QKD scheme and BBM protocol [5] as its
entangled state counterpart.

4.1.1 B92 protocol

A modiﬁed version of BB84 with less resources was proposed by Bennett in 1992 [3]. Hence, the protocol is referred to as
B92 protocol. The B92 scheme can be summarized in the following steps:

B92 1: Alice sends a random string of |0i and |+i to Bob, where it is assumed that |0i and |+i correspond to bit values
0 and 1, respectively.
We can easily observe the modiﬁcation from BB84 as, in BB84 a random string of {|0i,|1i,|+i,|−i} was prepared.

B92 2: Bob measures the received qubits in either computational {|0i,|1i} or diagonal {|+i,|−i} basis randomly.

Here, Bob does not announce his choice of basis, which is in contrast to BB84.

B92 3: From his measurement outcome Bob keeps only the qubits with measurement outcome |1i or |−i and announces
the same. Subsequently, Alice also discards the rest of the qubits. The reason behind discarding the measurement
outcomes can be understood by noting that a contribution to measurement outputs |0i or |+i can be from both the
initial states |0i and |+i, due to which the measurement outcomes |0i or |+i can lead to a non-conclusive result.
Therefore, only |1i or |−i outcomes are considered which correspond to Alice’s bit values 1 and 0. Hence, these
qubits can be used to generate a random symmetric key.

B92 4: Bob announces the measurement outcomes of a part of the generated string with the positions of the qubits for
veriﬁcation of eavesdropping. For the corresponding qubits Alice checks the measurement outcome with the initial
state as |0iA → |−iB and |+iA → |1iB. For the errors above a tolerable limit the protocol is discarded. Otherwise
a secure and symmetric key can be generated between the two users.

The protocol described above can be studied under various noise models. When the qubit prepared by Alice travels to
Bob under the eﬀect of AD noise, the obtained ﬁdelity is

F QKD

AD1 =

1

4 (cid:16)p1 − η + 3(cid:17) .

(4)

Here, and in the remaining part of the paper, required expressions of ﬁdelity are provided using a notation of the
form F x
ji, where j : j ∈ {AD, PD , CR , CD , SGAD , P} is the type of noise model; i is 1 and 2 for single-qubit-
based and entanglement-based schemes, respectively; and x denotes the type of secure quantum communication, i.e.,
x ∈ {QKD, QKA, QSDC, QD}. Now, considering that travel qubits have propagated via a PD channel, we obtain

(−η + 4) .
In the collective noisy environment, the obtained ﬁdelity expressions are

4.1.2 BBM protocol

The BBM protocol [5] is a variant of the Ekert protocol [4], with reduced resources. Speciﬁcally, Ekert protocol uses three
mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) to calculate the correlation function for detecting eavesdropping when the entanglement
source was kept in between the two authenticated users Alice and Bob [4].
In contrast, in BBM protocol, the source
of entangled photon is given to Alice and the requirement of three MUBs are reduced to two [5]. The protocol can be
summarized as follows.
BBM 1: Alice prepares a string of the singlet state |φ−i = |01i−|10i√2

and sends the second qubit to Bob keeping the ﬁrst

qubit with herself.

BBM 2: Both Alice and Bob measure their qubits of shared quantum state in either computational {|0i,|1i} or diagonal
{|+i,|−i} basis randomly. Both the users announce their choices of measurement basis, but not the measurement
outcomes.

BBM 3: Both users decide to discard the measurement outcomes where their choices of measurement basis were diﬀerent,

as in all the remaining cases their measurement outcomes are supposed to be correlated.

BBM 4: Finally, both the users choose around half of the string of the undiscarded instances and announce corresponding
measurement outcomes. If the error in the measurement outcomes is below certain tolerable limit both Alice and Bob
can obtain a symmetric key using the outcomes of the measurements performed on the remaining qubits which are
not used for eavesdropping check. In other words, a lack of correlation in the measurement outcomes is a signature
of the presence of an adversary.

The entanglement-based protocol of QKD considered here, i.e., BBM scheme, under the AD, PD, CD and CR noises lead
to the following ﬁdelities expressions

and

respectively. In case of Pauli channels, the ﬁdelity only depends on the probability with which the state remains unchanged

F QKD

P 2 = p1.

(14)

Hence, a linear plot is expected. When the qubits travel under the dissipative SGAD channel, the compact form of ﬁdelity
is

Now, we will try to make a comparative analysis of the obtained ﬁdelities expressions in the QKD protocols from the
two classes. When the travel qubits are subjected to AD noise we observe that B92 protocol performs better than BBM
protocol for all values of decoherence rate η. Quite similar nature is observed with PD noise as well. The gradual decrease
in the ﬁdelity with the increasing decoherence rate for all these cases can be observed in Fig. 1 a and b. The fact observed
here is consistent with some of our recent observations that single qubits perform better while traveling through AD and
PD channels [27]. Interestingly, ﬁdelity obtained for both the QKD schemes considered here is the same when the travel
qubits are subjected to CR noise, as can be seen in Fig. 1 c. In the presence of another type of collective noise (namely
CD noise), which is dephasing in nature, B92 is again seen to perform better (cf. Fig. 1 d). Here, it is worth noting that
the singlet state is decoherence free in an arbitrary collective noise when both the qubits of the single state travel through
the noisy channel. However, when one of the qubits travels through the channel having collective noise, it gets aﬀected
by the noise and as a consequence singlet state also gets aﬀected by the noise. This is what we have observed here.

Expressions of ﬁdelity under Pauli noise reveal that for BBM protocol equally aﬀected states will be obtained for
bit-ﬂip, phase-ﬂip, bit-phase ﬂip errors with certain probability. For the depolarizing channel the ﬁdelity expression shows
a similar nature. The same expression is obtained for B92 protocol with bit-phase ﬂip error. Further, bit-ﬂip and phase
ﬂip errors with equal probabilities aﬀect the state in a similar manner as the expression becomes same in both the cases.
The values are always higher than all others for the same amount of error as shown in Fig. 1 e. The obtained ﬁdelity in
depolarizing channels can be seen to be intermediate between the last two.

From the ﬁdelity expressions of SGAD noise, the corresponding ﬁdelities under AD and GAD channels can be obtained
as limiting cases. In Fig. 1 f we can see the advantage obtained due to squeezing. Speciﬁcally, for non-zero squeezing
we can obtain higher ﬁdelity than that with a GAD noisy environment for a longer time period. Further, it can also be
observed that a state is more aﬀected while traveling through ﬁnite temperature bath than in the vacuum bath (AD).

4.2 QKA protocols and eﬀect of noise on them

In realistic scenarios, it may be preferable that a single party does not control the whole key. In such scenarios QKD can
be circumvented by a key agreement protocol, where all the parties can equally contribute in the ﬁnal key. To be precise,
QKA schemes are studied under two notions: weaker and stronger. In the weaker notion of QKA protocols, the ﬁnal key
is generated after negotiation between both the parties. If we follow this notion, then many of the QKD schemes can be
viewed as QKA schemes, such as BB84, B92 and BBM discussed in the previous subsection. However, in the strong notion
all the parties contribute equally to the ﬁnal shared key. Many QKA schemes have been proposed in the past ([8, 9, 10]
and references therein).

4.2.1 Single-qubit-based QKA protocol

A single-qubit-based quantum key agreement protocol given by Chong et al., in 2010 [10] can be described in the following
steps:

QKA1-1 Alice randomly prepares an n bit raw key KA and a random string of 0 and 1.

QKA1-2 Alice prepares n qubits in such a way that for every 0 (1) in the key she prepares either |0i or |+i (|1i or |−i)
depending upon the corresponding bit value in the random string 0 or 1, respectively. Finally, she sends all the
qubits to Bob.

QKA1-3 Bob also prepares an n bit raw key KB. Now, to encode this key he applies I (iY ) on the received qubits for 0

(1).

QKA1-4 Bob selects a random sequence from the qubits as veriﬁcation string and announces the positions of the corre-

sponding qubits. He also announces his raw key.

QKA1-5 Alice can extract a ﬁnal key as K = KA ⊕ KB from her and Bob’s keys. Subsequently, she broadcasts the
obtained values corresponding to the qubits Bob had chosen as veriﬁcation string along with the information of basis
chosen for each qubit in QKA1-2.

QKA1-6 Using the information of the basis chosen Bob can also extract the ﬁnal key K. If the obtained values for Alice

and Bob have errors below a tolerable limit they share an unconditionally secure quantum key.

If the single-qubit-based QKA scheme described above is implemented using a quantum channel having AD noise then we

4.2.2 Entangled-state-based QKA protocol

There are various protocols of quantum key agreement that exploit entanglement. Here, we wish to summarize a protocol
proposed by Shukla et al. in 2014 [9].
QKA2-1 Alice prepares |ψ+i⊗n, where |ψ+i ≡ 1√2

(|00i + |11i). She also prepares a raw key KA of n bits. She prepares

a string of all the ﬁrst particles to be sent to Bob keeping all the second qubits with herself.

QKA2-2 Alice prepares n

2 Bell states |ψ+i⊗ n

of the Bell states and sends the 2n qubits to Bob after applying a permutation operator Π2n.

2 as decoy qubits and concatenates them with the string of the ﬁrst particles

QKA2-3 After an authentic acknowledgment of the receipt of all the qubits Alice announces the positions of the decoy
qubits, i.e., information of Πn. Using this information Bob performs a Bell state measurement on partner pairs and
calculates error rate. It would be relevant to mention that the decoy-qubit-based security achieved here with GV
subroutine can be equivalently done by BB84 subroutine where single qubit decoy qubits are used. They decide to
proceed if error rates are below a certain value.

QKA2-4 Bob also prepares a raw key KB. Further, on the remaining qubits Bob encodes his raw key by applying I
or X operations for 0 and 1, respectively. Subsequently, he prepares n
2 Bell states as decoy qubits and permutes
the string of 2n qubits by permutation operator Π′2n after concatenating the decoy and encoded qubits. Finally, he
sends them to Alice.

QKA2-5 Bob informs the coordinates of the decoy qubits using which Alice computes the error rate. From this they

choose whether to proceed or not.

QKA2-6 Alice announces her key publicly from which Bob can generate the ﬁnal key K = KA ⊕ KB.
QKA2-7 Bob announces the permutation operator to rearrange the particles in the encoded string with Alice. Using this
Alice performs a Bell state measurement on the partner pairs of home and travel qubits. The measurement outcome
would reveal Bob’s key to Alice.

QKA2-8 Alice can also obtain the ﬁnal shared, unconditionally secure, quantum key K.

For QKA schemes two way quantum communication is involved unlike QKD protocols in the previous section, where
only sender to receiver communication is involved. In both single-qubit-based and entangled-state-based QKA schemes
ﬁdelity falls gradually with an increase in decoherence rate η when subjected to AD and PD noisy environments of identical
strength (cf. Fig. 2 a and b). Similar to the QKD scheme, single-qubit-based schemes perform better than the entangled-
state-based ones in both these noisy channels. Further, this similarity between the single-qubit-based QKD and QKA
schemes for collective noises, is depicted in the corresponding curves shown in Figs. 1 c and d and Figs. 2 c and d. However,
the entangled-state-based QKA scheme is seen to beneﬁt under collective noise as ﬁdelity for the entangled-state-based
QKA scheme is more than that of single-qubit-based protocol, under the assumption of the same noise strength in both
rounds of the travel qubit. This fact can be attributed to diﬀerent choices of Bell state in entanglement-based QKD and
QKA protocols.

Further, as discussed in the previous section, the collective noise parameter remains the same for all the qubits traveling
through a channel at a particular time, but can have a diﬀerent value at any other time. The eﬀect of two diﬀerent values
of noise parameters, of the collective noises, on the ﬁdelity of the obtained state can be studied by showing either 3
dimensional variation or contour plots. Fig. 3 a and b (c and d) show both these kinds of plots for QKA scheme subjected
to CR (CD) noise. Hereafter, we will stick to the contour plots to illustrate the eﬀect of two parameters. Interestingly, it
can be observed that it is possible to obtain states with unit or null ﬁdelity for some values of noise parameters.

For the single-qubit-based scheme, the analytic expressions for ﬁdelities are the same for all three types of Pauli channels
(i.e., for bit ﬂip, phase ﬂip and bit-phase ﬂip channels). The expressions of ﬁdelity for bit ﬂip and phase ﬂip channels
are also the same for the entangled-state-based protocol, but for bit-phase ﬂip error, we obtain a diﬀerent expression for
ﬁdelity, and it is observed that the obtained value of ﬁdelity is smaller compared to the corresponding values for bit ﬂip
and phase ﬂip errors. Fig. 2 e shows variations of ﬁdelity in all these error channels, where an increase in ﬁdelity for
entanglement-based QKA schemes can be attributed to the presence of quadratic terms in the ﬁdelity expression. The
variation of ﬁdelity in Fig. 2 f considering a dissipative interaction via SGAD channel for both kinds of QKA schemes
reemphasize the facts established by their QKD counterparts (cf. Fig. 1 f). Speciﬁcally, with increase in temperature,
dissipation increases, causing decay in the ﬁdelity of the recovered state. Also, squeezing turns out to be a useful resource
here, as observed from the increased ﬁdelity of the SGAD plots compared to their GAD (without squeezing) counterparts
after a certian evolution period.

4.3 QSDC protocols and eﬀect of noise on them

Quantum secure communication not necessarily involves a key generation or key agreement. There are direct communi-
cation protocols avoiding key generation and such protocols are referred to as the protocols for secure direct quantum
communication. These protocols can be broadly categorized as QSDC and DSQC protocols depending upon the require-
ment of additional classical communication for decoding of the information. QSDC protocols do not require any additional
classical communication other than that involved in eavesdropping checking, while DSQC protocols do. Here, we wish to
discuss two QSDC protocols and compare them in the presence of noise.

4.3.1 LM05 protocol

A QSDC protocol without using entanglement was proposed by Lucamarini and Mancini in 2005 which is now known as
LM05 protocol [17]. The protocol can be brieﬂy describe in the following steps:

LM1 Bob (receiver) prepares a random string of |0i,|1i,|+i,|−i and sends it to Alice.
LM2 Alice chooses randomly half of the received qubits as a veriﬁcation string (to be used as decoy qubits) and performs
eavesdropping checking on these qubits. Speciﬁcally, Alice measures all the qubits in the veriﬁcation string in MUBs
{0, 1} or {+,−} randomly. Then she announces the choice of basis with the position of qubits. Based on this,
Bob announces the qubits where he has chosen the same basis to prepare the initial state. Depending on this, the
measurement outcomes of Alice are expected to be the same with the state prepared by Bob in the absence of any
attempt of eavesdropping. For errors below a tolerable limit they proceed to the next step, else they start afresh.

LM3 To encode her message on half of the remaining qubits Alice applies operator I (iY ) for sending 0 (1). Subsequently,
she returns the encoded qubits to Bob. Here, it would be nice to mention that using such a scheme, for both choices
of encoding, a particular initial state will transform into orthogonal states. Consequently, at Bobs end, a message
can be easily decoded by measuring the state in the basis it was prepared.

LM4 Alice announces the coordinates of the qubits she had not encoded on (as she wished to use them as decoy qubits
for Alice to Bob communication). Bob measures corresponding qubits in the basis he had prepared them initially
to check the presence of Eve for Alice to Bob travel of the encoded particles. The same task can also be achieved
by Alice encoding on all the remaining qubits after eavesdropping in LM2, while she prepares additional string of
equal number of qubits in |0i,|1i,|+i,|−i randomly for eavesdropping checking in this step.

LM5 Only if Bob is convinced of the absence of Eve, he decodes the message sent by Alice by measuring the qubits in

the same basis he had prepared them in LM1, otherwise they abort the protocol.

The eﬀect of the AD noise on the single-qubit-based QSDC protocol (LM05 protocol) opted here, LM05, can be deduced
from the ﬁdelity expression

The corresponding expression under the eﬀect of PD noise is

Similar to the entanglement-based QKA scheme, two rounds of quantum communication is involved here, due to which
the expressions of ﬁdelity under CD noise

4.3.2 Ping-pong protocol

An entangled-state-based QSDC protocol was proposed by Bostr¨om and Felbinger in 2002 [16]. Precisely, LM05 protocol
is a single-qubit-based counterpart of PP protocol. The PP protocol works as follows:
PP1 Bob prepares |ψ+i⊗n, where |ψ+i ≡ 1√2

(|00i + |11i). Then he sends all the ﬁrst particles to Alice keeping all the

second qubits with himself.

PP2 Alice forms a veriﬁcation string by randomly choosing a set of n

2 qubits to perform BB84 subroutine as was done in
LM2. Speciﬁcally, Alice measures the qubits randomly in {0, 1} or {+,−} basis and announces the choice of basis.
Bob also measures his qubits in the same basis. In the absence of Eve, their measurement outcomes are expected
to be correlated. In the absence of such a correlation they discard the protocol and return to PP1, otherwise they
proceed.

PP3 Out of half of the remaining qubits Alice randomly makes two sets of equal number of qubits. One set for encoding
her message and another set for eavesdropping check for Alice to Bob communication. To encode 1 Alice applies X
gate before sending the qubit to Bob, and for sending 0 she returns the qubit unchanged.

PP4 Alice informs the coordinates of veriﬁcation string and Bob performs BB84 subroutine to compute the error rate.

PP5 For low error rates, Bob performs Bell state-measurement on the partner pairs to decode the message sent by Alice.

The analytical expressions of ﬁdelity in the case of the PP protocol exactly match those for entanglement-based QKA
scheme [9]. Therefore, we avoid repetition of the expressions and carry on with the discussion regarding the comparison
between LM05 and PP protocols under noisy environments.

Both the QSDC protocols when subjected to noise are aﬀected to diﬀerent extent. Precisely, as observed in the protocols
discussed so far, the single-qubit-based schemes have been found to be more eﬃcient as compared to entangled-state-based
schemes in AD and PD noisy channels. This is also observed here in Figs. 4 a and b. Under the assumption of the same
noise parameter for CD and CR noise for Alice to Bob and Bob to Alice travel of the qubits, PP protocol is aﬀected by the
CR and CD noise in a manner similar to the entangled-state-based QKA protocol. In fact, in the entangled-state-based
QKA scheme one of the parties sends the raw key by PP type QSDC while the other party announces it. Therefore, the
eﬀect of noise is the same as in PP protocol. The single-qubit-based scheme has diﬀerent nature in Fig. 4 c and d as
compared to the corresponding QKD and QKA protocols. This can be attributed to the two way quantum communication
associated in this scheme, unlike the last two cases where it was unidirectional. Further, in the presence of CD noise, the
beneﬁt of bidirectional communication can be easily observed as the observed ﬁdelity is more than the previous cases.
The single qubits (in LM05) perform better when subjected to CD noise, but suﬀer more under the inﬂuence of CR noise.
In Fig. 5, we have not shown the contour plots for the ﬁdelity for PP protocol under collective noise as the expressions
are exactly the same as that illustrated through Fig. 3 for Shukla et al’s QKA scheme. The contour plots also show that
very low ﬁdelity is also possible for some particular values of noise parameters during the two directions of transmission.
Further, under the eﬀect of CD noise, a similar nature of the ﬁdelity variation under LM05 and PP protocols can be
observed in Fig. 5. However, a closer look reveals that under CD noise ﬁdelity obtained for LM05 protocol is more than
that obtained for PP protocol, indicating that for CD noise, single-qubit-based LM05 protocol performs better than the
corresponding entangled-state-based PP protocol.

The expressions of ﬁdelity under Pauli noise reveal that the ﬁdelity for PP protocol in bit, phase and bit-phase ﬂip is
the same as the ﬁdelity for bit-phase ﬂip errors for equal probability of error in LM05 protocol. In this case the ﬁdelity
resurrects to 1 for maximum probability of error. Quite a similar nature is observed for ﬁdelity under bit ﬂip and phase
ﬂip errors in LM05 scheme though it remains less than that of the corresponding values in the PP protocol. Similarly,
under the inﬂuence of the depolarizing channel the ﬁdelity fails to revive but remains always more for LM05 protocol.

The advantage of squeezing, a purely quantum resource, can be observed in Fig. 4 f, where in the presence of squeezing
after an appreciable amount of time, ﬁdelity higher than the corresponding case of zero squeezing can be observed.
Speciﬁcally, higher ﬁdelity under SGAD channel relative to AD channel shows that coherence can be sustained using
squeezing that would have been lost due to the presence of non-zero temperature.

4.4 Quantum dialogue protocols and eﬀect of noise on them

One of the most eﬃcient secure quantum communication schemes is the quantum dialogue (QD). In this scheme both the
legitimate parties encode their information on the same qubits and at the end of the protocol each party can deduce the
others message. The ﬁrst QD scheme was proposed by Ba An using Bell states in 2004 [11]. Recently, Yang and Hwang
proposed a QD scheme immune to the collective noise using logical qubits [15]. Here, we consider two QD protocols for
analyzing their performance when subjected to noisy environments.

4.4.1 Single-qubit-based QD protocol

A modiﬁed QD protocol using only single qubit states and MUBs was proposed by Shi et al.
protocol can be described in the following steps:
QD 1 Bob prepares a sequence of 2n single qubits randomly in {|0i,|1i} or {|+i,|−i} basis. He intentionally prepares
two copies of n qubits, i.e., two adjacent photons are in the same quantum state. For example, Bob prepares a
string of single qubits as {(|0i,|0i) , (|+i,|+i) , (|−i,|−i) , (|1i,|1i)}, and out of each pair, one qubit will be used for
encoding while the other one will be used to send the initial state information. He also prepares some additional
decoy qubits to be used for eavesdropping check in each round of communication. Finally, he sends all the 2n qubits
after inserting decoy qubits randomly in them to Alice.

in 2010 [14]. Shi et al.

QD 2 Bob and Alice perform security checking for the received qubits. Speciﬁcally, Bob will announce positions of the
decoy qubits he chooses for this round of communication and Alice announces her choice of measuring basis and
corresponding outcome. Using that Bob determines the error rate and decides whether to proceed or call oﬀ the
protocol.

QD 3 With the help of Bob, Alice can separate three sequences: the ﬁrst one of decoy qubits, and two sequences of one
copy of initial states each. Out of these three sequences she encodes her message on the second sequence using I
(iY ) operation for sending bit value 0 (1). Subsequently, she encodes a checking message on the decoy qubits using
the same scheme and concatenates these two encoded sequences. Finally, she sends this concatenated sequence after
randomizing to Bob while keeping the last sequence with herself.

QD 4 After receiving authenticated receipt of all the qubits from Bob, Alice will announce the positions of the decoy
qubits and being aware of the preparation basis he decodes the message and announces it publicly. With this
checking message Alice decides whether to go to the next step or start afresh.

QD 5 If they decide to proceed, Bob also encodes on the received qubits after rearranging them using the same encoding
scheme as Alice. Subsequently, he performs measurement on all these qubits in the basis in which they were prepared
and announces the measurement outcomes. From the measurement outcomes, Bob gains the knowledge of Alice’s
encoding as he knows his encoding apart from the initial and ﬁnal state. Further, the measurement outcomes also
reveal the choice of the basis used for preparation of the states. Using this information Alice measures the third
sequence, she had kept with herself in QD 3, in a suitable basis and learns the initial state of Bob. From the
information of the initial and ﬁnal states, Alice can extract the message of Bob by using her knowledge of her
encoding.

4.4.2 Ba An protocol of QD

In the originally proposed Ba An’s QD scheme, both parties can communicate simultaneously using Bell states [11, 12, 13].
The protocol can be summarized in the following steps:
QD:BA 1 Bob prepares |ψ+i⊗n : |ψ+i = |00i+|11i√2

. He encodes his message on the ﬁrst qubit (travel qubit) and keeps
the second qubit with himself as home qubit. To encode his message he uses dense coding, i.e., he applies unitary
operations I, X, iY and Z to encode 00, 01, 10 and 11, respectively.

QD:BA 2 Bob sends all the ﬁrst qubits to Alice and conﬁrms their receipt.

QD:BA 3 Alice also encodes on the travel qubit using the same rule as was used by Bob and sends them back to Bob.
Bob performs a Bell measurement on the partner particles (Bell measurement is done on a qubit from the sequence
of home qubits and another qubit from the sequence of travel qubits, which was initially entangled with the chosen
home qubit).

QD:BA 4 After Alice’s disclosure Bob comes to know whether it was message mode (MM) or control mode (CM)1. Bob
announces his measurement outcome in the MM using which both Alice and Bob can learn each others message.
While in CM Alice announces her encoding which Bob uses for eavesdropping checking.

In the original Ba An’s QD scheme, when subjected to AD and PD noise, the ﬁdelity can be seen to be

and

1In fact, a random choice of MM or CM mode by Alice provides security in the protocol. In CM mode, both the legitimate parties opt to

check eavesdropping while in MM mode they proceed with the communication.

respectively. The presence of quadratic terms is a signature of bidirectional quantum communication involved. Under the
coherent eﬀect of CD noise on the travel qubits, we obtain

When the travel qubit is transmitted through a Pauli channel the ﬁdelity is the same as that obtained in case of PP
protocol. The analytic expression of ﬁdelity for Ba An protocol of QD, when subjected to SGAD noise is

When both the protocols of QD are subjected to AD noise the ﬁdelity obtained for the entangled-state-based protocol
is comparable of that of the single-qubit-based one. This is in contrast with the earlier observations reported in the present
work, where single-qubit-based schemes were found to be preferable in cases of AD and PD noise models. Though, in
the large decoherence limits the single-qubit-based QD turns out to be a suitable candidate (cf. Fig. 6 a). It is worth
commenting here that the decay in the ﬁdelity of single-qubit-based QD scheme when compared with the corresponding
QSDC protocol (as they are of the same order in entanglement-based schemes) can be attributed to an extra single qubit
traveling through the noisy channel in step QD 1. However, under the eﬀect of PD channels, the observation established
from the previous three secure quantum communication schemes (namely, QKD, QKA and QSDC protocols) remains valid
(cf. Fig. 6 b), in other words, it is observed that the single-qubit-based schemes perform better in PD channels. When
Ba An protocol of QD is subjected to collective noise the same nature of ﬁdelity variation as was observed in PP protocol
is observed if the same noise parameters are used in to and fro travel of the qubits. However, in the single-qubit-based
QD scheme a diﬀerent nature from LM05 protocol is observed. Interestingly, a close look at Figs. 4 c (d), and Fig. 6 c
(d) reveals that compared to LM05 protocol, an extra dip is observed at θ = π
2 (where for LM05 ﬁdelity was obtained to
be unity). This dip was observed in single-qubit-based QKA scheme, too (cf. Fig. 2 c). This point further establishes the
fact that the ﬁdelity of single-qubit-based QD schemes decays, when subjected to AD noise. The contour plots shown in
Fig. 7 also demonstrate that the single-qubit-based QD scheme has a diﬀerent nature of ﬁdelity variation compared to
that in LM05 protcol, while in entangled-state-based protocol it remains similar to that observed in PP.

The expression of ﬁdelity under Pauli noise shows that for Ba An protocol of QD it is the same as in PP protocol.
However, the presence of cubic terms in the expressions of ﬁdelity for single-qubit-based QD is a signature of the nature
observed in Fig. 6 e, i.e., the descent for very low and high error probabilities. For the bit/phase ﬂip error the single-
qubit-based scheme remains the preferred choice, but for very high probability of errors it should be avoided. A similar
nature is also observed under the inﬂuence of a depolarizing channel. For bit-phase ﬂip error, ﬁdelity indicates better
performance of entanglement-based scheme as compared to their single-particle counterparts.

Under a dissipative interaction with a non-zero temperature bath, a behavior similar to that observed under an AD
channel is seen. However, due to the non-zero squeezing, single-qubit-based QD scheme turns out to be a better candidate.
Fig. 6 f further reiterates the facts observed in Fig. 6 a-d, i.e., the obtained nature in the case of Ba An protocol of QD is the
same as in PP protocol; and in single-qubit-based scheme, it can be explained as a compound eﬀect of single-qubit-based
QKA and QSDC protocols.

5 Conclusion

The comparative study of single-qubit-based and entangled-state-based schemes of secure quantum communication per-
formed in the present work has lead to a number of interesting conclusions. Firstly, the equivalence observed in the ideal
noiseless scenario is lost in more practical scenarios where noise is present. Next, it is observed that it is not possible to say
unambiguously that in a noisy environment entangled-state-based protocols perform better than the single-qubit-based
protocols or vice versa. In fact, it depends on the nature of the noise present in the channel. Speciﬁcally, single-qubit-based
schemes are generally found to be the suitable choice in the presence of AD and/or PD noises, while entanglement-based
protocols turns out to be preferable in the presence of collective noises. As SGAD and GAD channels are generalizations

dashed (red) lines correspond to the single-qubit-based and Ba An’s QD protocols, respectively. For CR and CD noises it
is assumed that the noise parameter is same for both the directions of travel of the qubit (i.e., Alice to Bob and Bob to
Alice). In (e), bit/phase ﬂip is shown together for the single-qubit-based QD and Ba An protocol of QD in smooth (blue)

of the AD channel, conclusions similar to that for the AD channel are also applicable to them. However, with an increase
in temperature, ﬁdelity is seen to decay. Squeezing is seen to play the role of a beneﬁcial quantum resource, in a host
of scenarios, in practical quantum communication. Also, it is observed that the eﬀect of noise depends upon the number
of rounds (how many times a travel qubit travels through the noisy channel) of quantum communication involved. For
instance, QKD protocols are least aﬀected by noise, while QD protocols are most aﬀected as in QKD protocols a travel
qubit travels only once through the noisy channel, whereas in Ba An protocol of QD, it travels twice through the noisy
channel. Further, the single-qubit-based QD scheme involves three rounds of communication as it requires Alice to Bob
and Bob to Alice transmission of qubits and an additional Alice to Bob travel of equal number of qubits. As a consequence,
single-qubit-based QD scheme is found to be the most aﬀected among the four diﬀerent single-qubit-based schemes for
secure quantum communication discussed in this paper.
