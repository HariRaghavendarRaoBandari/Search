Abstract. We use the most recent type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations to perform a statistical
comparison between the standard ΛCDM model and its extensions (wCDM and w(z)CDM) and some
alternative cosmologies, namely: the Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati (DGP) model, a power-law f (R) sce-
nario in the metric formalism and an example of vacuum decay (Λ(t)CDM) cosmology in which the
dilution of pressureless matter is attenuated with respect to the usual a−3 scaling due to the interaction
of the dark matter and dark energy ﬁelds. We perform a Bayesian model selection analysis using the
Aﬃne-Invariant Monte-Carlo Ensemble sampler. In order to obtain the posterior distribution for the
parameters of each model, we use the Joint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA) SNe Ia compilation contain-
ing 740 events in the interval 0.01 < z < 1.3. The data are analysed with the SALT-II light-curve
ﬁtter and the model selection is then performed by computing the Bayesian evidence of each model
and the Bayes factor between them. The results indicate that the JLA data only cannot distinguish
the standard ΛCDM from its alternatives but their combination with current measurements of baryon
acoustic oscillations can. We provide a rank order for the models considered and also discuss the
inﬂuence of the H0 priors on the results.

Almost two decades ago, distance measurements of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) provided the ﬁrst
direct evidence for a late-time cosmic acceleration [1, 2]. Nowadays, this phenomenon is also con-
ﬁrmed from independent data, such as, for instance, the most recent measurements of the baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO) from galaxy surveys (see, e.g., [3] for a recent review on BAO measure-
ments). From the theoretical side, however, the absence of a ﬁrm physical mechanism responsible for
the present acceleration of the Universe has given rise to a number of alternative explanations.

In general, mechanisms of cosmic acceleration are explored in two diﬀerent ways: either intro-
ducing a new ﬁeld in the framework of the Einstein’s general theory of relativity (GR), the so-called
dark energy, or introducing modiﬁcations in GR at very large scales. In the general relativistic frame-
work, the simplest explanation is to posit the existence of a cosmological constant Λ, a spatially
homogeneous component whose pressure and energy density are related by pΛ = wρΛ, with the
equation-of-state (EoS) parameter w = −1. However, as well known, the standard ΛCDM model
(cosmological constant Λ plus cold dark matter) provides a good ﬁt for a large number of obser-
vational datasets without addressing some important theoretical issues, such as the ﬁne tuning of
the Λ value and the cosmic coincidence problems [4–6]. If the cosmological term Λ is null or it
is not decaying in the course of the expansion, as discussed in the so-called vacuum decay or Λ(t)
cosmologies [7–11], an alternative possibility (which also does not address the above issues) is to
assume the presence of an extra degree of freedom in the form of a minimally coupled scalar ﬁeld
φ (quintessence ﬁeld). Among other things, what observationally may distinguish Λ or Λ(t) from
φ is the time-dependency of the EoS parameter of quintessence ﬁelds, whose behaviour has been
parameterised phenomenologically by several authors (see, e.g., [12–16] and references therein).

The observed cosmic acceleration can also be seen as the ﬁrst evidence of a breakdown of
GR on large scales rather than a manifestation of another ingredient in the cosmic budget. The
most usual examples of cosmologies derived from modiﬁed or extended theories of gravity include
f (R) models, in which terms proportional to powers of the Ricci scalar R are added to the Einstein-
Hilbert Lagrangian [17–23], and higher dimensional braneworld models, in which extra dimension
eﬀects drive the current cosmic acceleration by changing the energy balance in a modiﬁed Friedmann
equation [24–30]. Since very little is known about the nature of the physical mechanism driving the
cosmic acceleration, an important way to improve our understanding of this phenomenon is to use
cosmological observations to constrain and select its many approaches.

In this paper we use the most recent type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations, the Joint Light-
curve Analysis (JLA) SNe Ia compilation containing 740 events in the interval 0.01 < z < 1.3, to
perform Bayesian model selection analysis using the Aﬃne-Invariant Monte-Carlo Ensemble sam-
pler [31]. We consider in our analysis diﬀerent classes of cosmological models and show that, while
the SNe Ia data alone cannot distinguish between the standard cosmology and some of its alternatives,
a joint analysis with current BAO data is able to rule out some scenarios. We also discuss the role of
the priors on the present expansion rate H0 on the results.

This paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we present the cosmological models considered
in our analysis. The Bayesian framework of model selection is brieﬂy discussed in section 3. The
data sets and methodology used in the analysis are discussed in sections 4 and 5, respectively. We
present and discuss the model comparison results in section 6. We summarise our main conclusions
in section 7.

2 Non-standard cosmological models

As mentioned earlier, the late-time cosmic acceleration is usually explored in two diﬀerent ways:
either including an extra component in the right-hand side of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations or modify-
ing gravity at large scales. In this work, we select models of both cases under the framework of a
ﬂat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric. In what follows, we brieﬂy discuss the scenarios
considered in our analysis.

2.1 Dark energy models with constant equation-of-state
General relativistic scenarios with a constant dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) w generalises the
standard ΛCDM model in which w = −1. In what follows, we refer to this model as wCDM model.
The corresponding Friedmann equation for this cosmology is given by

E(z)2 = Ωm,0a−3 + Ωde,0a−3(1+w) ,

(2.1)

where E(z) = H(z)/H0 is the normalised Hubble parameter and Ωm,0 and Ωde,0 correspond, respec-
tively, to the current values of clustered matter (baryonic and dark) and dark energy density parame-
ters, which obeys the normalisation condition Ωde,0 = 1 − Ωm,0.
2.1.1 Dynamical dark energy models
A more general case can be studied by allowing the equation-of-state of the dark energy component
to vary as a function of the cosmological scale factor a. In this case, the Friedmann equation takes
the form

E(z)2 = Ωm,0a−3 + Ωde,0 exp

In order to discriminate the dynamical dark energy (the time-varying nature of EoS) from that of
Λ cosmological constant, we consider two kinds of w(a) parameterisations. First, the so-called
Chevallier–Polarski–Linder (CPL) parameterisation [13, 14], given by:

w(a) = w0 + wa(1 − a) ,

(2.3)

where w0 stands for the EoS’s value today whereas wa describes its time evolution. For this parame-
terisation, the last term of Eq. (2.2) is written as:

Ωde,0a−3(1+w0+wa) exp [−3wa(1 − a)] .

(2.4)

As discussed by Wang and Tegmark (2004), the above parameterisation cannot be extended to the
entire history of the universe since it blows up exponentially in the future (a → ∞) for wa > 0.
Therefore, we also consider a second dynamical dark energy parameterisation suggested by ref. [15]:

w(z) = w0 + wa

z(1 + z)
1 + z2 ,

(2.5)

which is well-behaved over the entire cosmic evolution and mimics a linear-redshift evolution at low
redshift. For this parameterisation (referred to it as BA parameterisation), the last term of Eq. (2.2)
can be written as:

(2.6)
Previous studies have shown that bounds on the w0 and wa parameters allow this dark energy com-
ponent to remain sub-dominant at z >> 1. For details about the classiﬁcation of diﬀerent dark energy
behaviours using parameterisation (2.5), we refer the reader to ref. [15].

2.2 Vacuum decay model
An interesting attempt to account for the cosmological constant problems has also been discussed in
the context of interacting dark matter and dark energy cosmologies. A number of ideas have been
examined in these lines (see, e.g., [7–10, 32–36] and references therein).

The model analysed in our study has a time-dependent cosmological term Λ(t) in which the

vacuum energy density ρΛ decays with the expansion of the Universe as [10, 37]

ρΛ = ˜ρΛ,0 +

ρdm,0
3 − 

a−3+ ,

(2.7)

where the  determines the diluting power of the dark matter density ρdm with respect to the usual
a−3 as ρdm ∝ a−3+. Depending upon the positive or negative values of , the energy is transferred
either from dark energy to dark matter or vice-versa, respectively. In such scenarios, dark matter will
no longer be independently conserved, such that

where ˜ΩΛ,0 = ΩΛ,0 − 3Ωdm,0/(3 − ). There is an extra degree of freedom compared to the standard
ΛCDM model due to such interaction (for more details on this class of models, see ref. [36]).

2.3 DGP model
The Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati (DGP) model [24] is an example of alternative approach which gov-
erns cosmic acceleration via modiﬁcation of the Einstein’s General Relativity, driven by higher-
dimensional theories.
In this model, our 4-dimensional universe is conﬁned to a 3D brane, em-
bedded in a 5-dimensional bulk space-time with an inﬁnite extra dimension. The energy-momentum
tensor only resides on the brane surface whereas the gravitational ﬁeld equations are driven by the
5-dimensional Einstein tensor and the 4-dimensional Einstein tensor of the induced metric on the
brane. Only gravity is allowed to propagate oﬀ the 3-brane into the bulk and this induced eﬀect on
the brane leads to an accelerated expansion.

A cross-over length scale, where the interaction between the eﬀective 4D and 5D gravities takes

place, is given by rc = M2

where ρ is the energy density of the cosmic ﬂuid. Note that in the limit of H ∼ r−1

solution is attained asymptotically which is the main feature of this model (see refs. [24, 39, 40] for

f (R)-gravity models

2.4
The simplest extension of General Relativity can be obtained by considering additional terms propor-
tional to powers of the Ricci scalar R in the Einstein–Hilbert Lagrangian, the so-called f (R) gravity.
Diﬀerently from general relativistic scenarios, f (R) cosmology can naturally drive an accelerating
cosmic expansion without introducing a dark energy ﬁeld [17].

We consider the Einstein–Hilbert action in the Jordan frame including f (R) function of the Ricci

scalar as

S =

(cid:90) √−g

f (R)
2k2 d4x + S matter(gµν) ,

(2.12)

where k2 = 8πG (G is a bare gravitational constant) and S matter represents the action of the matter
minimally coupled to gravity. We assume the metric formalism, in which the connections are assumed
to be the Christoﬀel symbols and the variation of the action is taken with respect to the metric.

In a ﬂat FRW spacetime, the ﬁeld equations for the action (2.12) is given by

the ΛCDM model for n = 0 and β = 4.38. For analysis involving BAO data we add a radiation term,
Ωγ,0 = 2.469 × 10−5h−2 [42], to all Friedmann equations above. A summary of the cosmological
models considered in our analysis is given in table 1.

3 Bayesian Model Selection

Bayesian inference is a way to describe the relationship between the model (or hypotheses), the data
and the prior information about the model parameters. In a parameter estimation problem, the starting
point for Bayesian data analysis is to compute the joint posterior for a set Θ of free parameters given
the data, D, through the Bayes’ Theorem [43]: P(Θ|D, M) = L(D|Θ, M)P(Θ|M)/E(D|M), where P,
L, P and E are the shorthands for the posterior, the likelihood, the prior and the Evidence1, respec-
tively. In short, the Bayes’ Theorem updates our previous knowledge about some model parameters
in the light of a given data set.
It is important to note that the Evidence E, the denominator of the Bayes’ Theorem, is just a
normalisation constant and is uninteresting for parameter estimation, since it does not depend upon
the model parameters. However, in a model comparison problem, the Evidence is used to evaluate the
model’s performance in the light of the data by integrating the product LP over the full parametric
space of the model:

(cid:90)

E(D|M) =

L(D|Θ, M)P(Θ|M) dΘ .

(3.1)
Therefore, the Evidence is the average value of the likelihood L over the entire model parameter
space that is allowed before we observe the data.

M

The most important characteristic of the Evidence is its application of the Occam’s razor to the
model selection problem. It rewards the models that ﬁt well the data and are also predictive, moving
the average of the likelihood in Eq. (3.1) towards higher values than in the case of a model which ﬁts
poorly or is not very predictive (either is too complex or have a large number of parameters) [44].
This concept has been widely applied in cosmology (see, e.g, [45–49]). It is used to discriminate two
competing models by taking the ratio

Bi j ≡ EiE j

,

(3.2)

which is also known as the Bayes’ factor of the model i relative to the model j. If each model is
assigned equal prior probability, the Bayes factor gives the posterior odds of the two models.

Table 2. A new version of the Jeﬀreys’ scale for the Bayes factor values discussed by ref. [50] and adopted in
our analysis. The second column shows the strength of the evidence of the model Mi relative to the model M j.
Negative values of ln Bi j means support in favour of the model M j.

To rank the models of interest, we adopted the scale showed in table 2 to interpret the values of
ln Bi j = ln (Ei/E j) in terms of the strength of the evidence of a chosen reference model. This scale,
suggested by ref. [50], is a revised and more conservative version of the so-called Jeﬀreys’ scale [51].
Note that the labels attached to the Jeﬀreys’ scale are empirical: it depends on the problem being
investigated. Thus, for an experiment for which | ln Bi j| < 1, the evidence in favour of the model Mi
is usually interpreted as inconclusive (see ref. [50] for a more complete discussion about this scale).

4 Data

4.1 Type Ia supernovae
In this work, we focus primarily on current distance measurements of SNe Ia to perform an observa-
tional comparison of the cosmologies discussed in the previous section. We use the so-called Joint
Light-Curve Analysis (JLA) sample which is an extension of the compilation provided by ref. [52]
(referred to C11 compilation), containing a set of 740 spectroscopically conﬁrmed SNe Ia. JLA is
a compilation of several low-redshift (z < 0.1) samples, the full three-year SDSS-II supernova sur-
vey [53] sample within redshift 0.05 < z < 0.4, the ﬁrst three years data of the SNLS survey [52, 54]
up to redshift z < 1 and a few high redshift Hubble Space Telescope (HST) SNe [55] in the interval
0.216 < z < 1.755. The photometry of SDSS and SNLS was re-calibrated and the SALT2 model is
retrained using the joint data set.

Theoretically, the distance modulus predicted by the homogeneous and isotropic, ﬂat FRW

universe is given by

µ(z, Θ) = 5 log

with the luminosity distance dL deﬁned as

dL(z) = (1 + z)

dL(z, Θ)
10 pc ,

dz(cid:48)
E(z(cid:48)) ,

(cid:90) z

0

(4.1)

(4.2)

where E(z) = H(z)/H0 is the normalised Hubble parameter. However, from the observational point
of view, the distance modulus of a SNe Ia is obtained by a linear relation from its light curve:

µ = mB − (MB − α × x1 + β × c) ,

(4.3)

where mB represents the observed peak magnitude in rest-frame B band, x1 is the time stretching
of the light curve, and c is the supernova color at maximum brightness. These three light-curve
parameters mB, x1 and c have a diﬀerent values for each supernova and is derived directly from the
light curves. The nuisance parameters α and β are assumed to be constants for all the supernovae,
but diﬀerent for diﬀerent cosmological models. Following directly ref. [56], we also assume a step

function relation for the absolute magnitude MB with the host stellar mass (Mstellar) to cooperate
the eﬀect of host galaxy properties on MB. Using Eqs. (4.1)–(4.3), one can obtain the predicted
magnitude, mB(z, Θ), for each one of the cosmological model discussed in the previous section. The
free parameters of our analysis corresponding to the JLA measurements are α, β, MB and ∆M.

Using the observed magnitude measurements mB(z) of the JLA sample (table F.3 of ref. [56])
and the predicted ones from Eqs. (4.1) and (4.3), the MCMC simulations for the JLA SNe Ia sample
were performed by assuming a multivariate Gaussian likelihood of the type

LJLA(D|Θ) = exp[−χ2

JLA(D|Θ)/2] ,

(4.4)

with

JLA(Θ) = [mB − mB(Θ)]T C−1 [mB − mB(Θ)] ,
χ2

(4.5)
where C corresponds to the covariance matrix of the distance modulus µ, estimated accounting vari-
ous statistical and systematic uncertainties. The light-curve ﬁt statistical uncertainties, the systematic
uncertainties associated with the calibration, the light-curve model, the bias correction and the mass
step uncertainty are described in details in the section 5 of ref. [56], whereas the systematic uncer-
tainties related to the peculiar velocity corrections and the contamination of the Hubble diagram by
non-Ia are described brieﬂy in ref. [52]. The uncertainty in redshift due to peculiar velocities, the
uncertainty in magnitudes due to gravitational lensing, and the intrinsic deviation in SN magnitude
are also taken into account while calibrating it.
Using the JLA sample, [56] claimed to have provided the most restrictive constraints so far, i.e.,
w = −1.027 ± 0.055 (assuming w = constant) and Ωm,0 = 0.295 ± 0.034 (for a ﬂat ΛCDM model).
Therefore, it is interesting to perform a similar analysis for non-standard cosmological models, cali-
brating the data to each cosmology and checking their constraining power on the model parameters.

4.2 Baryon acoustic oscillations
Besides the JLA supernovae dataset, we also consider in our analysis the measurements of BAO in
the galaxy distribution. The BAO in the primordial plasma have striking eﬀects on the anisotropies
of CMB and the large scale structure of matter. The measurements of the characteristic scale of the
BAO in the correlation function of matter distribution provides a powerful standard ruler to probe
the angular-diameter distance versus redshift relation and the Hubble parameter evolution. This
distance-redshift relation can be obtained from the matter power spectrum and calibrated by the CMB
anisotropy data.

Usually, the BAO distance constraints are reported as a combination of the angular scale and
the redshift separation. This combination is obtained by performing a spherical average of the BAO
scale measurement and is given by

we also include three correlated measurements of dz(z = 0.44) = 0.073, dz(z = 0.6) = 0.0726 and
dz(z = 0.73) = 0.0592 from the WiggleZ survey [59], with the following inverse covariance matrix:

(4.9)

Using the same methodology applied to the JLA SNe Ia compilation, we also consider a mul-
tivariate Gaussian likelihood for the BAO data set. For each survey listed in the ﬁrst column of the

where dz,survey and dz(zsurvey, Θ) are the observed and theoretical dz, respectively, and σsurvey is the

form

WiggleZ(D|Θ) =(cid:2)dz,i − dz(Θ)(cid:3)T C−1(cid:2)dz,i − dz(Θ)(cid:3) .

(4.11)
Then, the BAO likelihood is directly obtained by the product of the individual likelihoods as LBAO =
L6dFGS ×LMGS ×LLOWZ ×LSDSS(R) ×LCMASS ×LWiggleZ. Similarly, the joint likelihood for the JLA
SNe Ia compilation and the BAO data is given by Ljoint = LJLA × LBAO.

5 Methodology

While the idea of the Bayes’ Theorem is simple to understand, the computation of the posterior and
the Evidence can be diﬃcult both analytically, since the necessary integrals cannot be evaluated in
closed form, and numerically, meaning that the integrations can be very time consuming when the
dimension of the parametric space is large. In order to solve this problem, a widely used practice is
to sample from the posterior by applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques (we refer
the reader to refs. [64–67] for some MCMC algorithms and to refs. [68, 69] for applications of some
of those algorithms in cosmology).

In this work, we applied an algorithm relying on the Python2 package emcee [70], an imple-
mentation of the Aﬃne-Invariant MCMC Ensemble sampler by ref. [31]. This method received its
name because the algorithm’s performance is invariant under linear transformations of the parameter

space, making it a good tool to sample from a highly degenerate Gaussian (or even a non-Gaussian)
distribution as well as from an uncorrelated isotropic one. This method works by moving several
chains (or walkers) in parallel through the parameter space. The proposal distribution for a given
walker depends on the positions of all the other walkers in the ensemble, since they carry information
about the underlying distribution. This can dramatically improve the convergence in comparison to
the classical Metropolis–Hastings algorithm (see ref. [71] for a recent benchmark of the Metropolis–
Hastings, Nested sampling and Aﬃne-Invariant methods using CMB measurements).

For all models discussed in section 2, we ran 250 walkers for 400 iterations (steps) in order
to get a sample with N = 105 points. However, before these 400 iterations, we also ran a burn-in
phase for each model by computing the exponential autocorrelation time τexp at each iteration. The
stopping criterion was chosen such that the burn-in phase stops if i > 20 × max(τexp), where i is the
iteration at the burn-in phase and max(τexp,i) is the maximum τexp,i among all the dimensions of the
parameter space at the i-th burn-in iteration. This is a very conservative stopping criterion and is more
than enough to ensure that initialisation was forgotten [71].

Since it is diﬃcult to integrate (3.1) numerically, emcee uses an alternative way to draw the
posterior distribution, the so-called parallel-tempering MCMC [72, 73]. This method works by sam-
pling from a modiﬁed posterior P ∝ L1/T P, where T (≥ 1) is called the “temperature” of the chain.
All the statistics are obtained from the chain with T = 1 only, from which the usual posterior of the
Bayes’ Theorem is recovered. By running multiple MCMC’s at diﬀerent temperatures, the procedure
explores well very diﬀerent parts of the parameter space: the hot walkers (large T) can easily sample
from regions of low probability while the cold ones (low T) are better to sample from the peaks of the
likelihood, improving the convergence in the case of a likelihood with more than one mode [70]. The
Evidence is estimated by this method after applying the thermodynamic integration technique 3 [74].
In this work, we ran our simulations using 20 temperatures, which is the emcee default value.
It is also worth mentioning that Bayesian inference (both parameter estimation and model se-
lection) strongly depends on the priors P(Θ|M) chosen for the free parameters. In our analysis, we
applied ﬂat (uniform) priors for almost all free parameters of the models analysed. The only excep-

tion is H0, for which we assumed both a ﬂat and a Gaussian prior of H0 = 73.8 ± 2.4 km s−1 Mpc−1,
as given by ref. [75]. All the priors used are shown in table 4. In the next section, we also discuss the
inﬂuence of the H0 prior on our results by considering a uniform prior in the interval [10, 150].

6 Results

In ﬁgure 1 we show the parametric space of Ωm,0 and the nuisance parameters α, β, MB and ∆M for
the standard ΛCDM model. These results are obtained using the JLA SNe Ia sample considering
the Gaussian prior on H0 displayed in table 4. As shown in the ﬁgure, our results are in excellent
agreement with those of ref. [56] (see ﬁgure 9 and table 10 of that reference for comparison). Similar
plots for the other cosmological models considered in this analysis are not shown for brevity.

Our main results are summarised in table 5 where the ﬁrst, second and third sub-tables cor-
respond to the results obtained using the JLA SNe sample alone, BAO measurements alone and a

Bayesian Evidence for the diﬀerent cosmologies considered in the analysis. The results were

joint analysis of SNe and BAO, respectively. These results consider Gaussian prior on H0 shown in
table 4. We ﬁrst observe that the current SNe Ia data alone cannot rule out any of the cosmological
models studied in this analysis while the joint analysis with BAO data is much more eﬀective to this
end. This is clearly seen in the last sub-table of table 5, where three models (CPL, BA and DGP)
are at least weakly disfavoured with respect to the standard model. We also note that among all, the
most dramatic change in the rank of the models happens for the DGP model. Although providing a
good ﬁt for the SNe Ia data (even better than the standard cosmology), the joint analysis with BAO
measurements reveals that this scenario is strongly disfavoured with respect to the ΛCDM model.

The above results should be compared with the ranking order provided by ref. [76]. These
authors used 103 SNe Ia from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey along with two data
points of the CMB/BAO ratio to rank a number of alternative cosmologies, some of which being also
considered in the current study. Their analysis was performed using two diﬀerent SNe Ia light-curve
ﬁtting, i.e., MLCS and SALT-II, and the model ranking is done using the Bayesian (BIC) and Akaike
(AIC) information criteria. Comparing our table 5 with table 3 (SALT-II) of ref. [76], we found a
good agreement between the rank order of both analyses. On the other hand, a comparison with
the ranking order presented in their table 3 (MLCS) shows a complete disagreement. This is fully
consistent with the overall conclusions of ref. [76] and shows the inﬂuence of the SNe Ia light-curve
ﬁtting on the parameter estimation and model selection.

Joint JLA + BAO analysis

obtained using the ﬂat prior on H0, as shown in table 4.

Bayesian Evidence for the diﬀerent cosmologies considered in the analysis. The results were

Finally, as mentioned earlier, the Bayesian approach depends on the prior information chosen
for the free parameters. In order to quantify such dependence we also display in table 6 the rank
of models when a ﬂat prior on the value of H0 is assumed. Comparing the joint JLA plus BAO
results of both analysis, one clearly sees that the evidence for the ΛCDM model is strengthened with
respect to the wCDM, CPL and BA scenarios. Another interesting aspect is concerned to the ﬂat
DGP model. For the ﬂat prior case, this model provides a good ﬁt to both JLA SNe Ia and BAO
data, which changes signiﬁcantly its ranking position when compared with the results of table 5.
Such diﬀerences emphasizes the importance of the value of the current expansion rate to this kind of
analysis. Although not shown in the tables, we also veriﬁed that for the range of H0 values discussed
by refs. [75, 77, 78], the ranking order of table 5 remains unaltered.

7 Conclusions

Given the current state of uncertainty that remains over the physical mechanism behind the observed
acceleration of the Universe, an important way to improve our understanding of this phenomenon
is to use cosmological observations to constrain its diﬀerent approaches.
In this paper, we have
performed a Bayesian model selection statistics to rank some non-standard cosmological models in
the light of the most recent SNe Ia (JLA compilation) and BAO data. Our analyses have showed

– 12 –

that the JLA data alone are unable to distinguish between the standard ΛCDM scenario and some
speciﬁc examples of coupled quintessence cosmologies (Λ(t)CDM), modiﬁed gravity models ( f (R)
and DGP) and simple parameterisations of the dark energy component. In particular, we have shown
that models like Λ(t)CDM and DGP provide the best-ﬁt to JLA data, with their Bayesian evidence
being inconclusive with respect to the standard ΛCDM model (see table 5).

We have also shown that some of these results are signiﬁcantly modiﬁed when a joint analysis
of SNe Ia and BAO data is performed. In this case, the evidence for the ΛCDM model is strengthened
with respect to the two time-dependent dark energy parameterisations (BA and CPL) considered in the
analysis and also to the DGP model. For this latter model, for instance, the joint analysis shows that
it becomes strongly disfavoured with respect to the standard cosmology, with ln B0i = 26.85, whereas
the analysis using the JLA data alone provides ln B0i = −0.194. These results are in full agreement
with previous ones using diﬀerent data sets (see, e.g., [76]). An important aspect worth emphasising
concerns the ranking position of the decaying vacuum cosmology considered in the analysis. As
discussed earlier (see section 2.2), in this kind of models the dark energy ﬁeld interacts with the
pressureless component of dark matter in a process that violates adiabaticity and that constitutes a
phenomenological attempt at alleviating the so-called coincidence problem [10, 37]. We have found
that this scenario provides an excellent ﬁt to both SNe Ia observations and SNe Ia plus BAO data
when the currently accepted interval for H0 is considered. By assuming a ﬂat prior on the present
expansion rate, we have found a weak evidence for this model with respect to the ΛCDM.

Finally, we have also explored the dependency of the Bayesian ranking order with two diﬀerent
priors on H0 and shown the importance of the value of the current expansion rate to the analysis
(for a broad discussion on the importance of more precise measurements of H0 for cosmology and
fundamental physics, see ref. [79]). For consistency, we have also veriﬁed in our analysis that the
ranking order of table 5 remains unaltered for the range of H0 values currently more accepted in the
literature, 67 ≤ H0 ≤ 75 (1σ) [75, 77, 78].
