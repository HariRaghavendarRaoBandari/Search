ABSTRACT
We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) to investigate how the presence of
Seyfert activity relates to their environment, herein represented by the galaxy cluster mass,
M200, and the normalized cluster centric distance, r/r200. We achieved this by constructing
an unbiased sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with morphological clas-
siﬁcations provided by the Galaxy Zoo Project. A propensity score matching approach is
introduced to control for the eﬀects of confounding variables: stellar mass, galaxy colour, and
star formation rate. The connection between Seyfert-activity and environmental properties in
the de-biased sample is modelled within a HBM framework using the so-called logistic re-
gression technique, suitable for the analysis of binary data (e.g., whether or not a galaxy hosts
an AGN). Unlike standard ordinary least square ﬁtting methods, our methodology naturally
allows modelling the probability of Seyfert-AGN activity in galaxies on their natural scale, i.e.
as a binary variable. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a HBM can incorporate information
of each particular galaxy morphological type in an uniﬁed framework. In elliptical galaxies
our analysis indicates a strong correlation of Seyfert-AGN activity with r/r200, and a weaker
correlation with the mass of the host. In spiral galaxies these trends do not appear, suggesting
that the link between Seyfert activity and the properties of spiral galaxies are independent of
the environment.

INTRODUCTION

For a long time it has been argued that active galactic nuclei (AGN)
are powered by the accretion of gas into a super-massive black
hole (SMBH) located at the centre of its host galaxy (e.g. Lynden-
Bell 1969; Magorrian et al. 1998; Orban de Xivry et al. 2011).
The AGN-driven energetic outﬂows, that are launched from the
accretion disk surrounding the SMBH, are fundamental processes
thought to shape the formation of massive galaxies. In particular,
AGN feedback is often invoked in semi-analytic models to explain

the suppression of gas accretion onto the host galaxy and the subse-
quent quenching of star formation (Birnboim & Dekel 2003; Kereš
et al. 2005; Dekel & Birnboim 2006; Somerville et al. 2008; Catta-
neo et al. 2009; Kereš et al. 2009; Cattaneo et al. 2011). Empirical
evidence supporting the idea that nuclear activity and the evolution
of the host galaxy are closely intertwined includes the tight corre-
lation between SMBH mass and the bulge velocity dispersion. The
latter is taken to imply a strong connection between the formation
and evolution of the central SMBH and that of the bulge (e.g., Fer-
rarese & Merritt 2000; Gebhardt et al. 2000; Tremaine et al. 2002;
Häring & Rix 2004; Somerville et al. 2008; Reines & Volonteri

2015). However, a detailed picture of how exactly AGN can aﬀect
the evolution of its host remains to be established.

The physical mechanisms that power the AGN are also a mat-
ter of debate. Some studies indicate that the dissipation of angu-
lar momentum during major mergers might allow gas to accrete
into the central black hole (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2006; Kaviraj et al.
2015). Other secular mechanisms, such as disk/bar instabilities,
colliding clouds, and supernovae explosions have also been pro-
posed as AGN activity triggers (see Kormendy & Kennicutt 2004;
Martini 2004; Jogee 2006; Booth & Schaye 2013, for reviews).
Therefore, one should expect to ﬁnd a correlation between AGN
activity and the visual morphology of its host galaxy. This connec-
tion has been explored in several studies. For instance, Orban de
Xivry et al. (2011) found that the hosts of Narrow-line Seyfert 1
systems tend to be very late-type galaxies, such as grand design
spirals, and Alonso et al. (2014) show that spiral galaxies hosting
AGN in groups are more likely to be barred than their counterparts
in the ﬁeld. Similar results were presented by Coelho & Gadotti
(2011), who found twice as many AGN among barred galaxies, as
compared to their unbarred counterparts, for low mass bulges. Nev-
ertheless, Cisternas et al. (2015) claim that the presence of a bar
has no inﬂuence on the AGN strength, with barred and unbarred
active galaxies showing equivalent X-ray luminosity distributions,
and Miller et al. (2003) also found that the AGN fraction is in-
dependent of the morphological type of the host galaxy, indicat-
ing that there is no overall relationship between the star formation
activity in the disk component of galaxies and the presence of an
AGN. However, Wada (2004) found evidence that mass accretion
is not constant during an activity cycle of 108 years, but is com-
posed of several shorter episodes. This diﬀerence in time scales
may explain the lack of success in ﬁnding a correlation between the
presence of structures at kpc scales (for example, disk/bar interac-
tions) with the emerging activity in galaxies, except for bright ob-
jects such as Quasars (e.g., Moles et al. 1995; Krongold et al. 2001).
Finally, Schawinski et al. (2010) found that in early-type galaxies,
it is preferentially those with the least massive central black holes
that are active, unlike late-type galaxies, in which the most massive
black holes are the active ones. Therefore, it is still unclear to what
strength the AGN activity is connected to the presence of particular
morphological features.

Environmental eﬀects could also turn on or oﬀ the AGN ac-
tivity. Instabilities originating from galaxy mergers, and from in-
teractions between the galaxy and the cluster potential could drive
gas towards the galaxy centre, powering the AGN. Notwithstand-
ing, the gas reservoirs of galaxies may be stripped by the tidal ﬁeld
of the group/cluster environment (Larson et al. 1980; Roediger &
Hensler 2005; Roediger et al. 2015, e.g.), by the numerous high-
speed encounters with smaller galaxies (e.g., Moore et al. 1996),
or by the ram pressure of the intra-cluster gas (Gunn & Gott 1972;
Roediger & Hensler 2005; Roediger et al. 2015). The absence of
gas to fuel the central black hole would inevitably lead to the
turn oﬀ of the nuclear activity. Von der Linden et al. (2010) found
that the fraction of star-forming galaxies hosting a powerful opti-
cal AGN is independent of the normalized cluster-centric distance,
r/r200,1 indicating that the link between star formation and AGN
in these galaxies does not depend on the environment. Nonethe-
less, the fraction of red galaxies which host a weak optical AGN
decreases towards the cluster centre, following the trend of star-

forming galaxies. This might indicate that environmental eﬀects
gradually quench both the star formation and the AGN activity.
More recently Pimbblet et al. (2013) found a strong relation be-
tween AGN activity and r/r200, with signiﬁcant increase of AGN
fraction from the cluster centre to 1.5 Virial radii, with massive
galaxies systematically hosting a larger fraction of AGN at any ra-
dial location.

Moreover, it is well known that many galaxy properties, such
as stellar mass (M∗; Schawinski et al. 2010), morphology (Dressler
1980; Calvi et al. 2012), star formation rate (SFR; Abraham et al.
1996; Hashimoto et al. 1998; Gómez et al. 2003; Kauﬀmann et al.
2004; Harris et al. 2016), and optical colours (Strateva et al. 2001;
Hogg et al. 2004; Kauﬀmann et al. 2004; Blanton et al. 2005;
Baldry et al. 2006) are strongly correlated with the environment
where the galaxy resides. Therefore, the interplay between these
competing processes result in a very intricate relation between the
AGN activity, galaxy properties and local environment. This re-
quires a careful statistical modelling and the construction of an un-
biased sample in order to make robust statistical and, consequently,
physical claims.

In this work, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian model
(HBM) to explore the roles of morphology, environment, and the
occurrence of Seyfert galaxies, fSeyfert. We use a logistic regres-
sion methodology, that is a technique designed to deal with binary
data (e.g. De Souza et al. 2015b). Additionally, to ease the biases
caused by competing eﬀects, we applied a propensity score match-
ing technique (PSM) to build a control sample of inactive galaxies
with similar colours (g− r), M∗, and SFR.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we provide
an overview of the sample selection, the derivation of galaxy and
cluster properties, and the selection of the AGN sample via emis-
sion line diagnostic diagrams. Section 3 gives a description of the
Bayesian statistical methodology. We present our results in depth in
Section 4, and, ﬁnally, we discuss their physical motivations along
with our conclusions in Section 5.

2 CLUSTER SAMPLE

In this section we describe our dataset, which was selected from the
updated version of the catalogue compiled by Yang et al. (2007, pri-
vate communication). The sample comprises groups and clusters of
galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey 7th (SDSS-DR7, Abaza-
jian et al. 2009), with additional data retrieved from the SDSS 12th
data release database (SDSS-DR12, Alam et al. 2015). We selected
all halos within a redshift range of 0.015 < z < 0.1, having at least
10 galaxy members, and with 13.4 < log M200 < 14.6, in which
M200 corresponds to the mass within spheres that are 200 times
denser than the critical density of the Universe at the cluster red-
shift2. We included galaxies up to ∼ 10 · r200 by applying an as-
signment scheme similar to the one described in Yang et al. (2007)
and Duarte & Mamon (2015). All galaxies residing in halos with
only one member were assigned to the group with the highest den-
sity contrast at that position. As for the M∗ and SFR, we adopted
the estimated values from Brinchmann et al. (2004). Our sample
includes only galaxies brighter than Mp,r < −20.4, in which Mp,r is
the k-corrected SDSS Petrosian absolute magnitude in the r-band.
This magnitude corresponds to the 95 per cent completeness limit

1 The quantity r200 is the radius inside which the mean density is 200 times
the critical density of the Universe at the cluster redshift.

for simplicity.

of the sample. The k-corrections were obtained with the kcorrect
code (version 4_2) described by Blanton & Roweis (2007), choos-
ing as reference the median redshift of the SDSS main galaxy sam-
ple (z = 0.1). All the criteria described above leads to a sample of
32,353 galaxies within 1,122 groups and clusters.

We also split the sample into two groups, ellipticals and spi-
rals, in order to avoid the oversimpliﬁed characterization of the
AGN host galaxies as a single class, but rather understand how the
galaxy-AGN co-evolution varies between morphologies (Schaw-
inski et al. 2010). This also helps to account for the well known
morphology-r/r200 relation, in which spirals tend to be mainly lo-
cated in the outskirts of their respective groups or clusters, whereas
ellipticals can be found specially in their inner parts towards re-
gions of increasing local galaxy density (e.g. Goto et al. 2003). The
morphological typing relies in the visual classiﬁcation scheme per-
formed by citizen scientists from the Galaxy Zoo Project (Lintott
et al. 2008). We use the deﬁnition of clean sample of Land et al.
(2008), which requires at least 80 per cent majority agreement on
the morphology of any object. 3

2.1 AGN selection

The classiﬁcation of objects in our sample is based on the diagram
introduced by Baldwin et al. (1981), hereafter BPT [but see also
Veilleux & Osterbrock (1987); Kewley et al. (2001); Kauﬀmann
et al. (2003); Stasi´nska et al. (2006); Schawinski et al. (2007)],
as shown in Figure 1, and is available for galaxies with the emis-
sion lines Hβ, [OIII], Hα, [NII] for which the signal to noise ratio
S /N > 1.5. The Star Forming galaxies are those whose emission
lines are partially or fully dominated by star formation in the dia-
gram as deﬁned by the theoretical extreme starburst line of Kewley
et al. 2001. Composite objects are the ones falling between this ex-
treme starburst line and the empirical pure starburst line of Kauﬀ-
mann et al. (2003). These are objects that are constituted by co-
existing/competing star formation and nuclear activity in terms of
ionizing luminosity strength. On the right side of the Kewley et al.
(2001) line reside the galaxies whose emission lines are dominated
by sources of ionization other than young stars, which are empiri-
cally divided into two major AGN sub-classes, the lower branch of
low-ionization narrow emission-line regions (or LINERs) and the
upper branch of Seyfert galaxies delimited by the line derived by
Schawinski et al. (2007). This leads to a classiﬁcation of objects
in our sample as Star Forming, Seyfert, LINER, and Composite as
displayed in Fig. 1, where we show the positions of all galaxies in
the sample on the BPT diagram.

Nonetheless, the nature of LINERs, as low-luminosity AGN,
is still uncertain and there is a growth of evidence indicating that the
majority of galaxies with such spectra classiﬁcation is unlikely to
be true AGN (see e.g., Stasi´nska et al. 2008; Schawinski et al. 2010;
Singh et al. 2013). Many of them may actually be retired galaxies
powered by old stellar populations (Maraston 2005; Cid Fernandes
et al. 2010). Due to this uncertain nature of LINER galaxies, and
with the intent to reduce contamination from false-negative AGN
in objects belonging to the Composite region, we chose to elimi-
nate most of them from our analysis, but allowing a narrow region
around the Kauﬀmann et al. (2003) curve (∆log([NII]/Hα) (cid:46) 0.05)
to accommodate inherent uncertainties in the curve deﬁnition. This
allows us to retain only the clearly distinct AGN and non-AGN host

galaxies in this study, following an approach similar to the one em-
ployed by Schawinski et al. (2010).

2.2 Control sample

Galaxies hosting AGN have diﬀerent characteristics from their in-
active counterparts, preferentially populating the so-called green
valley and red sequence of the colour-mass diagram (e.g. Smolˇci´c
2009; Schawinski et al. 2010). Additionally, in recent years, there
has been an ongoing discussion regarding AGN feedback and the
connection with SFR: it is believed that AGN activity suppresses
the formation of new stars (Page et al. 2012; Booth & Schaye 2013;
Bluck et al. 2014; Li et al. 2015). Given that spirals are usually
rich in gas and dust, and consequently have high levels of SFR,
it is possible to observe a peak of SFR in spirals that do not host
AGN. Moreover, the distribution of galaxy colours is linked to the
SFR distribution: bluer galaxies possess younger stellar popula-
tions, whereas spirals which host AGN are redder and have older
stellar populations. These trends can be seen in our sample, both
in the colour-mass and colour-SFR diagram in the top and bottom
panels of Fig. 2, respectively. The galaxies hosting Seyfert-AGN
(orange dots) are compared against inactive galaxies in the sample
represented by the bulk of grey dots.

To mitigate this bias, mostly due to the spirals, we built a
control sample of inactive galaxies (i.e. those under the curve
described by Kauﬀmann et al. 2003) by matching each pair
Seyfert/non-Seyfert galaxy against
the confounding covariates,
Xc = {M∗,(g− r),S FR}, and their morphological type4. The match
is performed via a non-parametric approach known as propensity
score matching (PSM, Ho et al. 2007; Austin 2011) using the
matchit R package (Ho et al. 2011). For each Seyfert galaxy, the
method searches for the closest inactive galaxy, in the multidimen-
sional space formed by Xc, via a k-nearest neighbourhood algo-
rithm (see e.g. §3.1; Ishida & de Souza 2013, for a review); the
results are presented in Fig. 3. After the PSM, the distributions of
the active and inactive sample closely resemble each other and any
potential eﬀect that Xc may have on the presence of a Seyfert-AGN
is subsumed, since Xc is virtually held constant within each pair of
galaxies. The ﬁnal de-biased sample is composed by 1,744 objects
from which 492 are ellipticals and 1,252 are spirals. The subset is
displayed in the BPT diagram (Fig. 1) as follows: cyan dots repre-
sent the control sample; the orange ones, the active sample. In the
following section, we describe how to build a Bayesian model to
explore the eﬀects of r/r200 and M200 in our de-biased sample.

3 BAYESIAN LOGISTIC MODEL

The simple linear regression model has long been a mainstay of as-
tronomical data analysis (e.g. Isobe et al. 1990; Feigelson & Babu
1992; Kelly 2007; Sereno 2016). One important example is the de-
termination of the line of best ﬁt through Hubble’s diagram (Hubble
1929; Abraham & van den Bergh 2001, more recently). Nonethe-
less, the assumptions of the linear model fall short when the data
to be modelled come from exponential family distributions other

4 Although (u− r) is the most commonly used SDSS colour to characterize
galaxies through the colour-mass diagram (e.g. Strateva et al. 2001; Baldry
et al. 2004, 2006), we chose to use the optical colour (g−r) due to the ageing
eﬀects and processes suﬀered by the u band, which can be non-negligible
for SDSS-DR7 data (see e.g. Doi et al. 2010).

represent the control sample of inactive galaxies selected with the propensity score matching (see Sec. 2.2). The solid curve is the Kauﬀmann et al. (2003) line:
galaxies above the curve are designated AGN, those below are regular star-forming galaxies. The dot-dashed line represents the Kewley et al. (2001) curve,
where galaxies between the Kauﬀmann et al. and Kewley et al. curves are deﬁned as composites: weaker AGN whose hosts are also star-forming galaxies. The
dashed line is the Schawinski et al. (2007) curve, which separates LINER and Seyfert objects.

than the Normal/Gaussian5 (Hardin & Hilbe 2012; Hilbe 2014).
For such problems, there is an overarching solution known as gen-
eralized linear models (GLMs). Regression models in the class of
GLMs, ﬁrst developed by Nelder & Wedderburn (1972), take a
more general form than in ordinary linear regression:
Yi ∼ f (µi,a(φ)V(µi)),
g(µi) = ηi,
ηi ≡ xT
In equation (1), f denotes a response variable distribution from the
exponential family (EF), µi is the response variable mean, φ is the
EF dispersion parameter in the dispersion function a(·), V(µi) is
the response variable variance function, ηi is the linear predictor,
= {xi1, xi2, . . . , xik}T is a vector of explanatory variables (co-
xT
variates or predictors), β = {β1, β2, . . . , βk} is a vector of covariate
i
coeﬃcients, and g(·) is the link function, which connects the mean
to the linear predictor η. If the response is Gaussian, then f = Nor-
mal, g(µ) = µ, a(φ) = 1, V(µ) = σ2, and the general form of the
GLM recovers the ordinary linear regression as a special case:
Yi ∼ Normal(µi, σ2),
µi = β0 + β1x1 +··· + βkxk.
To date, there has been only a handful of astronomical studies ap-
plying GLM techniques, such as logistic (e.g., Raichoor & An-
dreon 2012, 2014; De Souza et al. 2015a), Poisson (e.g., Andreon

Poisson, Bernoulli, Gamma, etc.)

& Hurn 2010), gamma (Elliott et al. 2015), negative binomial (De
Souza et al. 2015b), and Normal regressions (Bhardwaj et al. 2016;
Lenz et al. 2016). The methodology discussed herein focuses on
logistic regression, which is suitable for handling Bernoulli (or
binomial) distributed data. The Bernoulli distribution describes a
process in which there are only two possible outcomes: success
or failure (yes/no, on/oﬀ, red/blue, etc.; typically coded as 1/0).
Bernoulli distribution is a particular case of the more general bi-
py(1 − p)n−y, for which
nomial distribution, Binomial(n, p) =
y is the number of successes (y = 1), n is the number of trials,
and p is the probability of success. For the Bernoulli distribu-
tion, Bernoulli(p) = py(1− p)1−y, the number of trials, n, is set to
1. The link function (Eq. 3) derives directly from the underlying
Bernoulli probability distribution and ensures a bijection between
the (−∞,∞) range of the linear predictor, η, and the (0,1) range
of non-trivial probabilities for the binomial population proportion
(the Bernoulli p). The natural link function for the Bernoulli distri-
bution is known as the logit link, which deﬁnes the logistic model:

g(p) = logit(p) ≡ log

The logit function has another desirable property: that the expo-
nentiated coeﬃcients of the linear predictors can be naturally inter-
p
preted in terms of an odds-ratio gradient,
1−p (e.g. the relationship
between the odds-ratio of AGN activity and distance to the clus-
ter centre). As for our analysis we employed an important exten-
sion of the GLM methodology known as generalized linear mixed
models (GLMMs; Hilbe 2009). The GLMM model, in our context,

where the index j represents the diﬀerent galaxy morphologies.
There are a few key advantages in this more general methodology
when compared to the standard approaches. Classical estimation,
which separates the information of each group in sub-samples, can
be useless if the sample size in a given group is too small. On the
other hand, if a classical regression is applied ignoring group indi-
cators, the results can be misleading by ignoring group-level vari-

ation. GLMMs, also known as multilevel modelling, represent a
compromise between the overly noisy analysis of each group inde-
pendently and the oversimpliﬁed approach that ignores group indi-
cators (Gelman & Hill 2007). A foremost reason to prefer a GLMM
model over a standard logistic model relates to the lack of indepen-
dence between observations when galaxy morphologies are con-
sidered as groups. A basic logistic model, whether estimated using
maximum likelihood or by using Bayesian methods assumes the
independence between each observation in the model. When the
data are grouped into levels based on galaxy morphology, this adds

CLUSTER PROPERTIES

To model the presence or absence of Seyfert galaxies, fSeyfert, we
apply a Bayesian logistic regression. The predictor variables re-
ﬂecting the environment where the galaxy resides and the host clus-
7. The r/r200 works as a proxy
ter property are r/r200, and log M200
for the local density measure, but can be also understood as a time-
scale, given its relationship to the time since the galaxy infall into
the cluster began (Gao et al. 2004) (modulo a small proportion of
‘backsplash’ galaxies; Pimbblet 2011). This time-scale is also con-
nected with processes that quench star formation in galaxies. For
instance, long-time scale interaction processes, such as strangula-
tion or harassment, would be eﬀective over the entire radial range,
while shorter time scale processes, such as ram pressure, would
be more localized near the centre, where the density of the gas is
higher (Von der Linden et al. 2010).

Our model simultaneously accounts for the dependence of
fSeyfert on r/r200, log M200, and galaxy morphology. The model is
portrayed as a graphical model in Fig. 4, and reads as follows: each
galaxy in the dataset, composed of N objects, has its probability of
hosting a Seyfert-AGN described by a Bernoulli distribution whose
probability of success, p ≡ fSeyfert, relates to r/r200, and log M200
through a logit link function (to ensure the probabilities will fall
between 0 and 1) and the linear predictor
η = β1, j + β2, j · log M200 + β3, j · r/r200,
where j is an index representing if a galaxy is elliptical or spiral.
We assume non-informative priors for the coeﬃcients β1, β2, β3,
where we assumed Normal priors with mean µ and standard devia-
tion σ for which we assign shared hyper-priors µ ∼ Normal(0,103)
and 1/σ2 ∼ Gamma(10−3,10−3).8 By employing a hierarchical
Bayesian model for the varying coeﬃcients βj, we allow the model
to borrow strength across galaxy types. This happens via their
joint inﬂuence on the posterior estimates of the unknown hyper-
parameters µ and σ2. Thus, the mixed model herein employed can
be understood as a compromise between an analysis that does not
account for the information regarding diﬀerent galaxy morpholo-
gies (e.g., Fig. 7; Pimbblet et al. 2013), and the one which splits
the data into independent slices (e.g. Fig 12; Von der Linden et al.
2010). The former implicitly assumes a pooled estimate (e.g., Gel-
man & Hill 2007), i.e. both galaxy types are sampled from the same
common distribution ignoring any possible variation among them.
The later represents an independent analysis for each class, making
the assumption that each morphological type is sampled from inde-
pendent distributions. Our GLMM, on the other hand, allows us to
account for the diﬀerences between elliptical and spiral hosts in an
integrated fashion.

Furthermore, by modelling the data on its natural scale (i.e.
as a binary variable), our model does not require any arbitrary
data binning, and our predicted fractions of AGN are always phys-
ically meaningful, even if extrapolated. Such features cannot be
achieved by standard linear ﬁtting methods. We refer the reader
to appendix B for the full script explaining how to implement the
model in jags.

The ﬁtted coeﬃcients are displayed in Tab. 1; in Fig A1, we
present their posteriors. To visualise how the model ﬁts the data, we

display, in Fig. 5, the predicted probabilities fSeyfert as a function of
r/r200 in slices of log M200. For each slice, we present the stacked
data, for illustrative purposes, and the ﬁtted model and uncertainty.
The shaded areas represent 50 per cent, and 95 per cent probability
intervals. We recall that the ﬁtting was performed without making
use of any data binning. The simple linear model, in the linear pre-
dictor scale, is ﬂexible enough to ﬁt the data well, without the need
of non-linear dependencies.

The coeﬃcients for the logit model represent the log of the
odds ratio for Seyfert activity. Since the predictors are scaled, it
allows us to perform a relative comparison between variables mea-
sured in diﬀerent units. For example, 1-σ variation in the r/r200
(≈ 2) towards the cluster outskirts for a elliptical galaxy residing in
a cluster with an average mass log M200 = 14 produces on average
a change of 0.197 in the log of odds ratio, or in other words it is
21.7 per cent more likely to be a Seyfert galaxy. Likewise, an ellip-
tical galaxy at an average r/r200 ( ≈ 2.2) residing in a cluster with
log M200 = 14.5 is ≈ 15.5 percent less likely to be a Seyfert galaxy
than a similar galaxy residing in a cluster with log M200 = 14. Un-
like elliptical galaxies, spirals are virtually unaﬀected by the po-
sition inside the cluster or the mass of its host, with all the ﬁtted
coeﬃcients being consistent with zero.

5 DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS

We study how Seyfert-AGN activity in elliptical and spiral galaxies
depends on local and global cluster properties, herein represented
by the cluster-centric distance and the mass of the galaxy clus-
ter. For such, we used a sample of low redshift clusters (0.015 <
z < 0.1), with at least 10 galaxy members each, and with 13.4 <
log M200 < 14.6, from which we include galaxies up to 10·r200.

We found that fSeyfert in elliptical galaxies strongly depends
on the r/r200, whereas no dependence is seen to occur for the spiral
hosts. The deﬁcit of AGN towards the cluster centre is in agree-
ment with previous investigations (e.g. Gilmour et al. 2007; Pimb-
blet et al. 2013), and might be explained by the fact that galaxies in
cluster centres should be more stripped of cold gas that can serve as
a fuel for AGN activity (Lietzen et al. 2011; Pimbblet et al. 2013).
Previous studies have shown that conditions in the central regions
of clusters are inhospitable for AGN activity even for galaxies in
pairs interactions. The proximity to the cluster centre may induce
decreases in AGN activity by limiting gas availability, most likely
of cold gas, around the galaxy (Khabiboulline et al. 2014). This
may be caused by the ram pressure stripping (Fujita 2004; Roedi-
ger & Hensler 2005; Roediger et al. 2015), which for ellipticals
may be considerably important, sweeping out the residual gas con-
tent of these galaxies, hence starving the central SMBH as con-
sequence (Schawinski et al. 2007; Booth & Schaye 2013; Li et al.
2015). This is also consistent with the recent ﬁnding of Boselli et al.
(2014), that using a volume-limited sample of nearby objects found
evidence that ram pressure truncates the infall of pristine gas from
the halo, being the dominant process driving the evolution of galaxy
clusters.

Nonetheless, a puzzle still remains: why spirals are not ef-
fected in the same way? We argue that the reason might be a con-
sequence of the extra gravitational force provided by their bulges,
which dominates the holding force in the central few kpc (see e.g.
the N-body simulations from Abadi et al. 1999). This is also con-
sistent with the more recent results from a hydrodynamical simu-
lation, which includes both mechanical and radiative AGN feed-
back, from Shin et al. (2012), which shows that the AGN activity
is less aﬀected by gas stripping than the SFR, because the SMBH
accretion is primarily dominated by the density of the galaxy cen-
tral region. This phenomenon may be related to the observational

ﬁndings of e.g. Schawinski et al. (2010), suggesting diﬀerent char-
acteristics for the evolution of SMBH within spirals and ellipticals.
This might be linked to the positive correlation between the mass
of the bulge and the mass of the central SMBH in spirals galaxies
(Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Häring & Rix 2004; Somerville et al.
2008; Reines & Volonteri 2015), which provides the extra potential
well in the few central kpc. Thus, the spirals might be capable of
holding the internal reservoir of gas independently of environment
eﬀects, thus keeping the fraction of nuclear activity nearly constant
throughout their position inside the cluster.

Our analysis and results can be summarized as follows:

• To control for eﬀects of confounding variables, we built a con-
trol sample of inactive galaxies matching each pair against their
M∗, (g − r), and SFR, hence allowing us to make cleaner claims
about causal eﬀects;
• The Bayesian logistic model does not need to rely on arbitrary
data binning, providing the proper scale for modelling a binary vari-
able (presence/absence of Seyfert). Therefore allowing an intuitive
interpretation of the ﬁtted coeﬃcients, and unbiased results when
compared to standard Gaussian approaches;
• The odds of Seyfert-AGN in elliptical hosts increases towards
the group/cluster outskirts by a factor of ∼ 21 per cent for one-σ
increase of r/r200, in clusters with an average mass of log M200 ≈
14, and the eﬀect is more prominent in more massive clusters;
• The mixed model used in this work accounts for the diﬀer-
ences between elliptical and spiral galaxies into an integrated fash-
ion, borrowing strength across sub-samples;
• The fSeyfert in spirals are virtually unaﬀected by the external
environment. We argue that this can be a consequence of the spirals
being able to hold an internal reservoir of gas, and this might be
caused by some type of protection provided by the galaxy’s disk or
by extra gravitational force provided by their central regions.

Generalized linear models are a cornerstone of modern statis-
tics, but nearly Terra incognita in astronomical investigations. In
the present work, we employed a Bayesian logistic mixed model
designed to represent binary data, to analyse the probability of
Seyfert-AGN activity as function of their position inside the group/-
cluster and the mass of its host. Standard approaches in the litera-
ture applying a classical linear regression in a fractional data (e.g.
fractions of AGN per bin of r/r200) do not have any restriction re-

be extrapolated while still providing meaningful results. The com-
bination of a propensity score matching and a Bayesian logistic
mixed regression allow us to model the fSeyfert with an unparalleled
statistical robustness up to date.

Finally we are able to answer the question posed in the tile: Is
the cluster environment quenching the Seyfert activity in elliptical
and spiral galaxies? In elliptical galaxies, yes. The regions towards
the cluster centre are hostile to the central SMBH residing in the-
ses galaxies. On the other hand, spirals appear to be spared and
they seem to keep feeding their AGNs while falling into the cluster
potential.

Figure A1. Computed posterior for the β coeﬃcients of Fig. 4 From top to
bottom β stands for: Intercept, log M200, and r/r200 for elliptical (left panel)
and spiral (right panel) galaxies respectively.

APPENDIX A: POSTERIORS

We display in Figure A1 the computed posteriors for the β coeﬃ-
cients in Equation conﬁdence interval.

APPENDIX B: JAGS MODEL

In the following, we show how to translate the graphical model in
Fig. 4 into jags using the r2jags package. Note that jags uses preci-
sion τ = 1/σ2 in place of variance σ2. The whole script, which one
should run from within r, to load the data and recover the coeﬃ-
cients displayed in Tab. 1 is given below:
