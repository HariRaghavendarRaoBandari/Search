LARGE DEVIATIONS PRINCIPLE FOR SOME BETA ENSEMBLES

TIEN-CUONG DINH AND VIˆET-ANH NGUYˆEN

ABSTRACT. Let L be a positive line bundle over a projective complex manifold X, Lp its
tensor power of order p, H 0(X, Lp) the space of holomorphic sections of Lp and Np the
complex dimension of H 0(X, Lp). The determinant of a basis of H 0(X, Lp), together with
some given probability measure on a weighted compact set in X, induces naturally a β-
ensemble, i.e., a random Np-point process on the compact set. Physically, this general
setting corresponds to a gas of free fermions on X and may admit some random matrix
models. The empirical measures, associated with such β-ensembles, converge almost
surely to an equilibrium measure when p goes to inﬁnity. We establish a large deviations
principle (LDP) with an effective speed of convergence for these empirical measures. Our
study covers the case of some β-ensembles on a compact subset of the unit sphere Sn ⊂
Rn+1 or of the Euclidean space Rn.

subset of Rn. We will obtain in this paper a LDP for such β-ensembles with an explicit
rate of convergence. Our approach uses however techniques from complex analysis, and
therefore we will ﬁrst describe the general setting, which, physically, corresponds to a
gas of free fermions and may admit some random matrix models. The reader will ﬁnd
in the paper of Berman [1] a detailed exposition and a list of references. The case of
β-ensembles on the unit sphere or on the real Euclidean space, mentioned above, will be
obtained as a corollary, see Examples 1.5 and 1.6 below.

Let X be a compact K¨ahler manifold of dimension n. Let L → X be a positive line
bundle endowed with a given smooth Hermitian metric h0. We assume that the metric
h0 is positively curved, that is, the Chern form ω0 associated with h0 is a K¨ahler form on
X. For simplicity, we will use the Riemannian metric on X induced by ω0. The space of
holomorphic sections of Lp := L ⊗ · · · ⊗ L (p times) is denoted by H 0(X, Lp). Since L
is ample, by Kodaira-Serre vanishing and Riemann-Roch-Hirzebruch theorems (see [18,
Thm 1.5.6 and 1.4.6]), we have

Here, kωn
of L.

0 k denotes the mass of the volume form ωn

If L1, L2 are line bundles over complex manifolds X1 and X2 respectively, we denote
by L1 ⊠ L2 the line bundle over the product manifold X1 × X2 deﬁned as L1 ⊠ L2 :=
π∗
1(L1) ⊗ π∗
2(L2), where π1, π2 are the natural projections from X1 × X2 to its factors. If
L1 and L2 are endowed with some Hermitian metrics, then L1 ⊠ L2 carries also a metric
induced by those on L1 and L2.

Let Sp = (s1, . . . , sNp) be a basis of H 0(X, Lp). We deﬁne the section det Sp of the line

bundle (Lp)⊠Np := Lp ⊠ · · · ⊠ Lp (Np times) over X Np by the identity

where SymNp denotes the permutation group of {1, . . . , Np}. Note that when we change
the basis Sp, this section only changes by a non-zero multiplicative constant.

Let K be a compact set in X and φ a continuous real-valued function on K. We say

that the pair (K, φ) is a weighted compact set. Let µ be a probability measure on K.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let β > 0 be a constant. A β-ensemble associated with the line bundle Lp,
the weighted compact set (K, φ) and the probability measure µ, is the random Np-point
process on K whose joint distribution is given by

(1.2)

νβ
p := cp,βk det Sp(x

(p))kβe−βp(φ(x1)+···+φ(xNp ))dµ(x1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ dµ(xNp),

where cp,β is the normalizing constant so that νβ

p is a probability measure on K Np.

Observe that the constant cp,β depends also on Lp, K, φ, µ, but the above random point
process, i.e., the measure νβ
p , is independent of the choice of the basis Sp of H 0(X, Lp).
We will study these β-ensembles when p goes to inﬁnity. We need some assumptions on
the regularity of K, φ and µ. Under such conditions, we will see later that the sequence
(p) converges almost surely to a limit µeq(K, φ) which is called the equilibrium measure
µx
of the weighted compact set (K, φ).

Recently, Berman [1] obtained a LDP in the spirit of Donsker and Varadhan [8] using
some functionals on the space of measures. In the case where K = X, φ = 0, and µ
is the Lebesgue measure on X, Carroll, Marzo, Massaneda and Ortega-Cerd`a obtained
precise and optimal estimates on the expectation of the Kantorovich-Wasserstein distance
(p) and µeq(K, φ) when p → ∞ [6]. An advantage of the latter work is that
between µx
Kantorovich-Wasserstein distance gives us a very explicit information about the conver-
(p) to µeq(K, φ). Our aim is to establish a LDP with precise estimations in
gence of µx

a quite general setting and in the sprit of the work by Carroll, Marzo, Massaneda and
Ortega-Cerd`a. In order to state the main result, we need to introduce some more notions.
Let M (X) denote the space of all (Borel) probability measures on X. For γ > 0, deﬁne

the distance distγ between two measures µ and µ′ in M (X) by

distγ(µ, µ′) := sup

kvkC γ ≤1(cid:12)(cid:12)hµ − µ′, vi(cid:12)(cid:12),

where v is a test smooth real-valued function. This distance induces the weak topology
on M (X). By interpolation between Banach spaces (see [10, 22]), for 0 < γ ≤ γ′, there
exists a constant c > 0 such that

(1.3)

distγ′ ≤ distγ ≤ c[distγ′]γ/γ′

.

Note that dist1 is equivalent to the classical Kantorovich-Wasserstein distance.

In Section 2 below, we will single out a very large class of compact sets K which
enjoy the so-called (C α, C α′)-regularity. We will also introduce the notion of δ-Bernstein-
Markov measures which enjoy a quantiﬁed version of the Bernstein-Markov property.
Here, δ is a constant such that 0 < δ < 1. Having in hand these natural notions, we are
in the position to state the main result of the paper.

Theorem 1.2. Let X be a complex projective manifold of dimension n. Let L be a positive
line bundle over X endowed with a smooth positively curved Hermitian metric h0. Let β > 0
and 0 < γ ≤ 2 be constants. Let K be a (C α, C α′)-regular compact subset of X and φ a
C α real-valued function on K for some constants 0 < α ≤ 2 and 0 < α′ ≤ 1. Let µ be
a probability measure on K which is δ-Bernstein-Markov with respect to (K, φ) for some
0 < δ < 1. Then, for every λ > 0, there are c > 0 and Borel sets Ep ⊂ K Np such that

p (Ep) ≤ e−λpn+1−δ ;

p denotes the empirical measure associated with x ∈ K Np \ Ep, then

distγ(µx, µeq(K, φ)) ≤ cqγ.

If a sequence of points x

(p) ∈ K Np satisﬁes x

(p) 6∈ Ep for p large enough, then we
(p) → µeq(K, φ) when p goes to inﬁnity. Therefore,
(p) converge almost surely to µeq(K, φ) when p goes to inﬁnity. More precisely, the

The estimate on the size of Ep is a version of LDP. Our result also implies that

This distance expectation estimate is similar to the one obtained by Carroll, Marzo, Mas-
saneda and Ortega-Cerd`a in [6] that we mentioned above. These authors proved for
K = X, φ = 0 and µ the normalized Lebesgue measure on X that there is a constant
c > 0 satisfying

for all p.

In order to get more concrete applications of our main result, we need the following

natural class of positive Borel measures.

Deﬁnition 1.3. We say that a positive measure µ on X satisﬁes the mass-density condition
with respect to a compact W ⊂ X if there are two constants c > 0 and ρ > 0 such that

µ(B(x, r)) ≥ crρ

for

x ∈ W and 0 < r < 1.

Here, B(x, r) denotes the ball in (X, ω0) of radius r and centered at the point x.

Assume now that K is a smooth real manifold in X with piecewise smooth boundary
such that the tangent space of K at each point is not contained in a complex hyperplane
of the tangent space of X at that point. It was shown in [9, 21], for 0 < α < 1, that K
is (C α, C α/2)-regular and is (C α, C α)-regular when its boundary is smooth, see Theorem
2.3 below. In this case, if µ is a probability measure on K satisfying the above mass-
density condition for W = K, we will show in Corollary 2.13 below that it satisﬁes the
δ-Bernstein-Markov property required in Theorem 1.2. Therefore, the following result is
a direct consequence of that theorem.

Corollary 1.4. Let X, L, h0, β, γ be as in Theorem 1.2. Let K be a smooth real manifold
in X with piecewise smooth boundary such that the tangent space of K at each point is
not contained in a complex hyperplane of the tangent space of X at that point. Let µ be a
probability measure on K satisfying the mass-density condition with respect to K. Let φ be
a C α real-valued function on K with 0 < α < 1. Then, for every 0 < δ < 1, the conclusion
of Theorem 1.2 holds for α′′ := α/(48 + 24α). Moreover, if the boundary of K is smooth, the
the same statement holds for α′′ := α/(24 + 12α).

Of course, Corollary 1.4 holds when µ is given by the normalized volume form on K.
It is worthy noting that the assumption on the mass-density condition of the measure µ
in this result can be weakened. In fact, we only need that µ satisﬁes the mass-density
condition on a subset W ⊂ K which satisﬁes a maximum principle, see Corollary 2.13
below.

Example 1.5. Let K be the closure of an open set with piecewise smooth boundary in
Rn. Let φ be a C α real-valued function on K and µ a probability measure on K which
satisﬁes the mass-density condition with respect to K. It is already interesting to consider
the case where µ is the normalization of the restriction to K of the Lebesgue measure on
Rn. Denote by Pp the set of real polynomials of degree at most p and Np the dimension
of Pp. Choose a basis (P1, . . . , PNp) of Pp. Deﬁne the probability measure νβ
p at a point
x = (x1, . . . , xNp) on K Np by
cp,β| det(Pi(xj))|βe−βp(φ(x1)+···+φ(xNp ))e− 1
2 βp(log(1+kx1k2)+···+log(1+kxNp k2))µ(x1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ µ(xNp),
where cp,β is a normalizing constant so that νβ
p is a probability measure. Here, det(·)
denotes the standard determinant of a square matrix. Then the conclusion of Theorem
1.2 holds for α′′ := α/(48 + 24α). If the boundary of K is smooth, we can take α′′ :=
α/(24 + 12α). The equilibrium measure µeq(K, φ) is a probability measure supported by
K. Its deﬁnition is given in Section 2.

In order to obtain this result as a consequence of Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.4,
consider Rn as the real part of Cn and Cn as a Zariski open set of the projective space

LARGE DEVIATIONS PRINCIPLE FOR SOME BETA ENSEMBLES

Pn. Denote by [z0 : · · · : zn] the homogeneous coordinates of Pn. We identify Cn with the
open set {z0 = 1}. Deﬁne X := Pn. We can identify, in the natural way, the polynomials
of degree ≤ p on Rn with holomorphic sections of Lp with L = O(1) the tautological line
bundle of X = Pn. We consider the standard Hermitian metrics on these line bundles. So
{P1, . . . , PNp} is identiﬁed to a basis of H 0(X, Lp). If a section s in H 0(X, Lp) is identiﬁed
to a polynomial P then

ks(z)k = |P (z)|e− 1

2 p log(1+kzk2)

for

z ∈ Cn.

So the factor involving log(1 + kxik2) in the deﬁnition of νβ
p is due to the standard Her-
mitian metric of Lp. We can now apply Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.4 and get the LDP
in this case. An interesting particular situation is the case where the weight φ is equal to
− 1

2 log(1 + k · k2).

Example 1.6. Let K be the closure of an open set with piecewise smooth boundary in
the unit sphere Sn of Rn+1. Let φ be a C α real-valued function on K and µ a probability
measure on K which satisﬁes the mass-density condition with respect to K. It is already
interesting to consider the case where φ = 0 and µ is the normalization of the restriction
to K of the Haar measure on Sn. Consider the functions which are restrictions of (real)
polynomials on Rn+1 to Sn. Denote by Pp the set of these functions obtained by using
polynomials of degree at most p and Np the dimension of Pp. Note that Pp is isomorphic
to the quotient of the space of polynomials of degree ≤ p by the subspace of polynomials
divisible by x2
n+1 − 1, where (x1, . . . , xn+1) is the standard coordinate system of
Rn+1.

1 + · · · + x2

Choose a basis (P1, . . . , PNp) of Pp. Deﬁne the probability measure νβ

p on K Np by

p (x) := cp,β| det(Pi(xj))|βe−βp(φ(x1)+···+φ(xNp ))µ(x1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ µ(xNp),
νβ

where x = (x1, . . . , xNp) is a point in K Np and cp,β is a normalizing constant so that νβ
p is
a probability measure. Then the conclusion of Theorem 1.2 holds for α′′ := α/(48 + 24α).
If the boundary of K is smooth, we can take α′′ := α/(24 + 12α). The measure µeq(K, φ)
is supported by K. In the case where K = Sn and φ = 0, by symmetry, this measure
coincides with the Haar measure on Sn.

In order to obtain this result as a consequence of Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.4, we
need to complexify Sn. Consider Rn+1 as the real part of Cn+1 and Cn+1 as a Zariski
open set of the projective space Pn+1. Denote by [z0 : · · · : zn+1] the homogeneous
coordinates of Pn+1. We identify Cn+1 with the open set {z0 = 1}. The sphere Sn is
then the intersection of Rn+1 with the complex hypersurface z2
0 in Pn+1.
Denote by X this hypersurface. We can identify, in the natural way, the polynomials of
degree ≤ p on Rn+1 with holomorphic sections of Lp with L = O(1) the tautological line
bundle of Pn+1. As in Example 1.5, we consider the standard Hermitian metrics on these
line bundles. Note that |z1|2 + · · · + |zn+1|2 is constant on Sn and therefore, the formula
for νβ
p is simpler than the one in Example 1.5. Observe also that a section of Lp vanishes
on X if and only if it vanishes on Sn. Therefore, {P1, . . . , PNp} is identiﬁed to a basis of
H 0(X, Lp). We can now apply Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.4.

n+1 = z2

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we discuss different notions of reg-
ularity for the weighted compact set (K, φ) and the measure µ. We also give criteria
to check the regularity conditions used in our study. In Section 3, we prove the main

theorem (Theorem 1.2) which uses an equidistribution result for almost Fekete conﬁgu-
rations. The last result has been obtained in collaboration with Ma in the last version of
[9, Remark 3.17]. For the reader’s convenience, we provides here a detailed proof that
we need in this paper. Note that the case of Fekete points can be seen as the limit case of
β-ensembles when β → ∞. We refer to [3, 9, 13, 14, 15, 21], the references therein and
also the end of this paper for more results on Fekete points and other conﬁgurations.

2. PLURI-REGULARITY FOR WEIGHTED COMPACT SETS AND MEASURES

As we have seen in Introduction, our study requires some regularity properties of the
weighted compact set (K, φ) and the probability measure µ on K. In this section, we will
recall some known facts and also introduce and study new notions that will be used in
the proof of our main theorem. The reader will ﬁnd in [7, 10, 12, 18] basic notions and
results from complex geometry and pluripotential theory.

Let L be a positive (i.e., ample) holomorphic line bundle over a projective manifold
X of dimension n. Fix a smooth Hermitian metric h0 on L such that its ﬁrst Chern form
ω0 is a K¨ahler form on X. Deﬁne µ0 := kωn
0 the probability measure associated
with the volume form ωn
0 which is the integral of this
volume form on X. Recall that a real-valued function on X is quasi-p.s.h. if it is locally
the difference between a p.s.h. function and a smooth one. Let PSH(X, ω0) be the cone
of ω0-p.s.h. functions, i.e., the quasi-p.s.h. functions ϕ such that ddcϕ + ω0 ≥ 0.

0 k is the total mass of ωn

0 . Here, kωn

0 k−1ωn

Deﬁnition 2.1. We call weighted compact subset of X a data (K, φ), where K is a non-
pluripolar compact subset of X and φ is a real-valued continuous function on K. The
function φ is called a weight on K. The equilibrium weight associated with (K, φ) is the
upper semi-continuous regularization φ∗

K of the function

φK(z) := sup(cid:8)ψ(z) : ψ ω0-p.s.h. such that ψ ≤ φ on K(cid:9).

We also call equilibrium measure of (K, φ) the normalized Monge-Amp`ere measure

µeq(K, φ) := kωn

0 k−1(ddcφ∗

K + ω0)n.

Note that the equilibrium measure µeq(K, φ) is a probability measure supported by
K = φK almost everywhere with respect to this measure, see e.g., [2]. The

K and φ∗
following notions are important in our study, see [9].

Deﬁnition 2.2. Denote by PK the projection onto PSH(X, ω0) which associates φ with
φ∗
K. We say that (K, φ) is regular if φK is upper semi-continuous, i.e., PKφ = φK. Let
(E, k kE) be a normed vector space of continuous functions on K and (F, k kF ) a normed
vector space of functions on X. We say that K is (E, F )-regular if (K, φ) is regular for
φ ∈ E and if the projection PK sends bounded subsets of E into bounded subsets of F .

We have the following result.

LARGE DEVIATIONS PRINCIPLE FOR SOME BETA ENSEMBLES

Theorem 2.3 ([9, 21]). Let X and L be as above. Let K be a smooth compact real manifold
in X with piecewise smooth boundary. Assume that the tangent space to K at any point is
not contained in a complex hyperplane of the tangent space to X at that point. Let 0 < α < 1
be any real number. Then K is (C α, C α/2)-regular. Moreover, it is (C α, C α)-regular if the
boundary of K is smooth.

Consider now a real-valued function ψ on X. We can associate the line bundle L with
a singular Hermitian metric h := e−2ψh0. More precisely, if v is a vector in the ﬁber of
L over a point x ∈ X, its norms with respect to the metrics h and h0 are related by the
formula

|v|h = e−ψ(x)|v|h0.

The metrics h0 and h induce in a canonical way metrics h⊗p
0 and h⊗p on the power Lp of
L. They are related by the formula h⊗p = e−2pψh⊗p
0 . Recall that for simplicity, we will
use the notation | · |pψ instead of | · |h⊗p for the norm of a vector in Lp with respect to the
metric h⊗p. We also drop the subscript h0, e.g., |v| means |v|h0.

Consider now a weighted compact set (K, φ) in X. We can, in a similar way, deﬁne
the metric h = e−2φh0 on L over K. Let µ be a probability measure with support in K.
Consider the natural L∞ and L2 semi-norms on H 0(X, Lp) induced by the metric h on L
and the measure µ, which are deﬁned for s ∈ H 0(X, Lp) by

(2.1)

kskL∞(K,pφ) := sup
K

|s|pφ

and

ksk2

L2(µ,pφ) := ZX

|s|2

pφdµ.

We will only use measures µ such that the above semi-norms are norms, i.e., there is
no section s ∈ H 0(X, Lp) \ {0} which vanishes on K or on the support of µ. The ﬁrst
semi-norm is a norm when K is not contained in a hypersurface of X. The second one is
a norm when the support of µ is not contained in a hypersurface of X. In particular, this
is the case when µ is the normalized Monge-Amp`ere measure with continuous potentials
because such a measure has no mass on hypersurfaces of X.

We need the following quantiﬁed Bernstein-Markov property, see also [2, 3, 16, 19].

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let δ be a real number with 0 < δ < 1 and (K, φ) a weighted compact
subset of X. We say that a positive measure µ on K is δ-Bernstein-Markov with respect
to (K, φ) if there is a constant A > 0 such that

(2.2)

kskL∞(K,pφ) ≤ AeAp1−δ

kskL2(µ,pφ)

for

s ∈ H 0(X, Lp) and p ≥ 1.

If µ is δ-Bernstein-Markov with respect to (K, φ) for all 0 < δ < 1, then we say that µ is
1-Bernstein-Markov with respect to (K, φ).

The following lemma shows that we can use the notion for other norms Lr.

Lemma 2.5. Let δ, r be real numbers with 0 < δ < 1 and r > 0. Let (K, φ) be a weighted
compact subset of X and µ a positive measure on K. Then µ is δ-Bernstein-Markov with
respect to (K, φ) if and only if there is a constant A′ > 0 such that

kskL∞(K,pφ) ≤ A′eA′p1−δ

kskLr(µ,pφ)

for

s ∈ H 0(X, Lp) and p ≥ 1.

Proof. Assume that µ is δ-Bernstein-Markov with respect to (K, φ). We will only show the
existence of A′ as in the lemma because the converse property can be obtained in the
same way. So we have property (2.2). Without loss of generality, we can assume that µ

LARGE DEVIATIONS PRINCIPLE FOR SOME BETA ENSEMBLES

8

is a probability measure. If r ≥ 2, then the Lr-norm is larger or equal to the L2-norm.
Therefore, we can just take A′ := A.

Assume now that 0 < r < 2. By H¨older’s inequality, we have

kskL2(µ,pφ) ≤ kskr/2

Lr(µ,pφ)ksk1−r/2

L∞(K,pφ).

This, together with (2.2), gives us the desired property for a suitable value of A′.

(cid:3)

In order to get a simple criterium for a measure to have the δ-Bernstein-Markov prop-

erty, we need the following notion.

Deﬁnition 2.6. A compact set W is said to satisfy the maximum principle relatively to a
weighted compact set (K, φ) if W ⊂ K and

sup
K

(ψ − φ) = sup
W

(ψ − φ)

for every ψ ∈ PSH(X, ω0).

Clearly, W = K satisﬁes the maximum principle relatively to (K, φ). In general, W

may be much smaller than K, see Remark 2.9 below.

Proposition 2.7. Let (K, φ) be a weighted compact set and W a compact subset of K. Deﬁne

∂φ
ω0K := {z ∈ K : PKφ(z) = φ(z)} .

Then W satisﬁes the maximum principle relatively to (K, φ) if and only if W ∩ ∂φ
the same property. In particular, ∂φ

ω0K satisﬁes
ω0K satisﬁes the maximum principle relatively to (K, φ)

Proof. Observe that the second assertion is a consequence of the ﬁrst one and Deﬁni-
tion 2.6 by taking W = K. We prove now the ﬁrst assertion. If W ∩ ∂φ
ω0K satisﬁes the
maximum principle relatively to (K, φ), then clearly W satisﬁes the same property. As-
sume that W satisﬁes this maximum principle. It remains to prove the same property for
W ∩ ∂φ

ω0K.

Recall that PKφ is upper semi-continuous and φ is continuous. Since PKφ ≤ φ, we

deduce that

So it is a compact set.

∂φ
ω0K = {z ∈ K : PKφ(z) ≥ φ(z)}

Let ψ ∈ PSH(X, ω0) and set m := maxK(ψ − φ). Note that ψ is also upper semi-
continuous. Since W satisﬁes the maximum principle relatively to (K, φ), there is a point
z0 ∈ W such that ψ − φ attains its maximum value at z0. We have ψ(z0) − m = φ(z0) and
ψ −m ≤ φ on K. Since ψ −m ∈ PSH(X, ω0), the last inequality implies that ψ −m ≤ PKφ.
In particular,

ψ(z0) − m ≤ (PKφ)(z0).

This, combined with the equality ψ(z0)−m = φ(z0) and the inequality (PKφ)(z0) ≤ φ(z0),
implies that (PKφ)(z0) = φ(z0). Hence, z0 ∈ ∂φ

ω0K and the proposition follows.

Remark 2.8. By [2, Prop. 2.10, Cor. 2.5], the equilibrium measure µeq(K, φ) is supported
by ∂φ

ω0K and its support also satisﬁes the maximum principle.

Remark 2.9. Let X be the projective space Pn, seen as the natural compactiﬁcation of
Cn. Let L be the tautological line bundle O(1) over Pn. Then the holomorphic sections of
Lp = O(p) can be identiﬁed to the complex polynomials of degree ≤ p on Cn. With the

standard Fubini-Study metric on O(p), if a section s of Lp corresponds to a polynomial
P (z) of degree ≤ p, then

Consider a compact subset K of Cn and take φ := − 1
to check that the boundary of K satisﬁes the maximum principle relatively to (K, φ).

2 log(1 + kzk2) on K. It is not difﬁcult

Theorem 2.10. Let X, L, h0 be as above, (K, φ) a weighted compact subset of X and µ a
probability measure on K. Let W ⊂ K be a compact set and 0 < δ < 1 a real number.
Assume in addition the following conditions:

(i) the functions φ and Pkφ are H¨older continuous;
(ii) W satisﬁes the maximum principle relatively to (K, φ);
(iii) µ satisﬁes the mass-density condition with respect to W , see Deﬁnition 1.3.

Then µ is a δ-Bernstein-Markov measure with respect to (K, φ).

Remark 2.11. We will see in the proof of this theorem that the condition (i) can be
replaced by the following much weaker condition : there are constant c > 0 such that for
z ∈ X and w ∈ K

|(PKφ)(z) − (PKφ)(w)| ≤ c(1 + log− dist(z, w))− δ

1−δ ,

and for z, w ∈ K

|φ(z) − φ(w)| ≤ c(1 + log− dist(z, w))− 1

1−δ ,

where log− := max(0, − log).

We are inspired by an idea of Bloom [5, Theorem 4.1]. Deﬁne ǫ := p−δ and r := e−c′p1−δ
where c′ > 0 is a large enough constant independent of p. It follows from Assumption (i)
(see also Remark 2.11) that

for

z ∈ B(z0, 2r) and z0 ∈ K.

(2.3)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(PKφ(cid:1)(z) − (PKφ)(z0)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ ǫ

Fix p ≥ 1 and s ∈ H 0(X, Lp) \ {0}. We need to prove inequality (2.2) for some constant

A > 0 independent of p and s. Observe that

[s = 0] − ω0 ≥ −ω0,

where [s = 0] is the current of integration on the hypersurface {s = 0}. So 1
p log |s| is
ω0-p.s.h. This, together with Assumption (ii), implies the existence of a point z0 ∈ W
such that

(2.4)

|s(z0)|pφ = max

Lemma 2.12. We have

|s(z0)|

for

z ∈ B(z0, r2).

Proof. Consider a section s′ = cs where the constant c is chosen so that ks′kL∞(K,pφ) = 1.
The last property implies the inequality 1
p log |s| is
ω0-p.s.h. So s′ satisﬁes a similar property. Hence, 1
p log |s′| ≤ PKφ on X. We then deduce
the following Bernstein-Walsh type inequality

p log |s′| ≤ φ on K. We have seen that 1

|s(z)| ≤ kskL∞(K,pφ)ep(PK φ)(z)

for

z ∈ X.

LARGE DEVIATIONS PRINCIPLE FOR SOME BETA ENSEMBLES

Using (2.4), we rewrite the last inequality for z ∈ B(z0, 2r) as

|s(z)| ≤ |s(z0)|pφep(PK φ)(z) = |s(z0)|e−p(cid:0)φ(z0)−(PK φ)(z0)(cid:1)ep(cid:0)(PK φ)(z)−(PK φ)(z0)(cid:1).

Using φ(z0) ≥ (PKφ)(z0) and (2.3), we obtain

(2.5)

|s(z)| ≤ |s(z0)|epǫ

for

z ∈ B(z0, 2r).

Let σ be a holomorphic frame for L on an open neighborhood U of z0 with |σ(z0)| = 1.
Write s = hσ⊗p with h a holomorphic function on U . Using local coordinates near z0 and
shrinking U if necessary, we may identify U with the open unit ball in Cn. We can also
assume that

(cid:12)(cid:12)|σ(z)| − 1(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ ckz − z0k

for some constant c > 0 independent of z ∈ U . For z ∈ B(z0, 2r), we have kz − z0k ≪ p−1
and the previous inequality implies that |σ⊗p(z)| belongs to the interval [7/8, 9/8] when
z ∈ B(z0, 2r). So the norm |s(z)| is bounded below and above by 7|h(z)|/8 and 9|h(z)|/8
respectively.

Consider the unit vector v := z−z0

kz−z0k in Cn, and the following holomorphic function of

one variable

We have for z ∈ B(z0, r)

f (ζ) := h(z0 + ζv),

ζ ∈ D.

(2.6)

|h(z) − h(z0)| = |f (kz − z0k) − f (0)| ≤ kz − z0k sup
|ζ|≤r

|f ′(ζ)|.

On the other hand, for |ζ| ≤ 2r, we have (z0 + ζv) ∈ B(z0, 2r), and by using the deﬁnition
of f, h, (2.5) and that |s(z)| is in-between 7|h(z)|/8 and 9|h(z)|/8, we obtain

|f (ζ)| ≤ c|s(z0)|epǫ

sup
|ζ|≤2r

for some constant c > 0. By Cauchy’s formula,
c
r

|f ′(ζ)| ≤

sup
|ζ|≤r

|s(z0)|epǫ.

This, together with (2.6) and the choice of ǫ, r, implies for z ∈ B(z0, r2) that

|h(z) − h(z0)| ≤ cr|s(z0)|epǫ ≪ |s(z0)|.

Recall that |h(z0)| = |s(z0)| and |s(z)| is bounded by 7|h(z)|/8 and 9|h(z)|/8. So the last
inequality implies the lemma.
(cid:3)

End of the proof of Theorem 2.10. We only need to consider p large enough. We will
prove that

We have

|s(z)|pφ ≥

z ∈ K ∩ B(z0, r2).

(cid:12)(cid:12)|s(z)|pφ − |s(z0)|pφ(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ (cid:12)(cid:12)|s(z)|pφ(z0) − |s(z0)|pφ(z0)(cid:12)(cid:12) +(cid:12)(cid:12)|s(z)|pφ(z) − |s(z)|pφ(z0)(cid:12)(cid:12).

Denote respectively by A1 and A2 the ﬁrst and second terms in the last sum. By Lemma
2.12, we have

A1 ≤

|s(z0)|e−pφ(z0).

LARGE DEVIATIONS PRINCIPLE FOR SOME BETA ENSEMBLES

11

On the other hand, by Lemma 2.12 again, we have

A2 = |s(z)||e−pφ(z) − e−pφ(z0)| ≤ 2|s(z0)|e−pφ(z0)|1 − e−p(φ(z)−φ(z0))|.

Since z ∈ B(z0, r2), we deduce from Assumption (i) of the theorem (see also Remark
2.11) that |p(φ(z) − φ(z0))| ≤ 1/16. Hence, |1 − e−p(φ(z)−φ(z0))| ≤ 1/8. Combining the
above estimates for A1 and A2, we obtain

(cid:12)(cid:12)|s(z)|pφ − |s(z0)|pφ(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤

1

|s(z0)|pφ

for

z ∈ K ∩ B(z0, r2).

This, combined with (2.4), implies (2.7).

Now, using (2.7) and Assumption (iii), we get

where c > 0 is the constant in Deﬁnition 1.3. Hence,

kskL∞(K,pφ) ≤ 2c−1/2eρc′p1−δ

kskL2(µ,pφ).

So µ is δ-Bernstein-Markov with respect to (K, φ).

(cid:3)

We have the following result where Condition (ii) is automatically satisﬁed for W = K.
It allows us to obtain Corollary 1.4 as a direct consequence of Theorem 1.2. Note that
in Corollary 1.4 we only need to assume that the measure µ satisﬁes the mass-density
condition with respect to a compact W ⊂ K which satisﬁes the maximum principle
relatively to (K, φ).

Corollary 2.13. Let X, L, h0 be as above, K a compact subset of X, W a compact subset of
K and µ a probability measure on K. Assume in addition the following conditions:

(i) K is (C α, C α′)-regular for some constants α > 0 and α′ > 0;
(ii) W satisﬁes the maximum principle relatively to (K, φ);
(iii) µ satisﬁes the mass-density condition with respect to W.

Then µ is a 1-Bernstein-Markov measure with respect to (K, φ) for every φ ∈ C α(K).

Proof. Since φ ∈ C α(K) and K is (C α, C α′)-regular, (K, φ) satisﬁes the hypotheses of
Theorem 2.10. According to that theorem, µ is δ-Bernstein-Markov with respect to (K, φ)
for every 0 < δ < 1. The corollary follows.
(cid:3)

3. ALMOST-FEKETE CONFIGURATIONS AND PROOF OF THE MAIN RESULT

In this section, we will give the proof of the main theorem. An important ingredient
is the equidistribution of almost-Fekete points towards the equilibrium measure. This
property is already mentioned in the last version of [9], see also [17]. For the reader’s
convenience, we will give here some details. We also give at the end of this section
another application of this result.

LARGE DEVIATIONS PRINCIPLE FOR SOME BETA ENSEMBLES

Theorem 3.1 ([9]). Let X, L, h0 be as above and K a compact subset of X. Let 0 < α ≤ 2,
0 < α′ ≤ 1 and 0 < γ ≤ 2 be constants. Assume that K is (C α, C α′)-regular. Let φ be a
C α real-valued function on K and µeq(K, φ) the equilibrium measure associated with the
weighted set (K, φ). Then, there is a constant c > 0 with the following property. For every
p ≥ 1 and every conﬁguration x = (x1, . . . , xNp) ∈ K Np, denote by µx the empirical measure
associated with x and let Sp be any basis of H 0(X, Lp). Deﬁne

σx :=

pNp
Then we have for all p > 1

1

log k det SpkL∞(K,pφ) −

pNp

log k det Sp(x)kpφ.

distγ(µx, µeq(K, φ)) ≤ cp−α′′γ(log p)3α′′γ + cσγ/4

x

with α′′ := α′/(24 + 12α′).

Note that det Sp is a section of the line bundle (Lp)⊠Np over X Np. The given metric h0
on L and the weight φ induces naturally a metric and a weight for this line bundle. So
k det SpkL∞(K,pφ) is the sup-norm of det Sp on K Np and k det Sp(x)kpφ is the norm of the
value of this section at the point x. Both of them are measured using the above natural
metric and weight. Observe that σx is independent of the choice of Sp and we always
have σx ≥ 0. When σx = 0, the point x is called a Fekete conﬁguration of order p of L
with respect to the weighted compact set (K, φ). The theorem shows that if σx is small
enough (e.g., when σx = 0), then µx tends to µeq(K, φ) as p → ∞.

We now sketch the proof of Theorem 3.1. Recall that the Monge-Amp`ere energy func-

tional E, deﬁned on bounded weights in PSH(X, ω0), is characterized by

E((1 − t)φ1 + tφ2) = kωn

0 k−1ZX

(φ2 − φ1)(ddcφ1 + ω0)n.

d

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

So E is only deﬁned up to an additive constant, but the differences such as E(φ1) − E(φ2)
are well-deﬁned, see [2] and also (3.2) below.

Consider a non-pluripolar compact set K ⊂ X and a continuous weight φ on K. Deﬁne

the energy at the equilibrium weight of (K, φ) as

Eeq(K, φ) := E(PKφ).

This functional is also well-deﬁned up to an additive constant. We have the following
property.

Lemma 3.2 ([2], Th. B). The map φ 7→ Eeq(K, φ), deﬁned on the afﬁne space of continuous
weights on K, is concave and Gˆateaux differentiable, with directional derivatives given by
integration against the equilibrium measure:

d

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

Eeq(K, φ + tv) = (cid:10)v, µeq(K, φ)(cid:11)

for every continuous function v on K.

Let µ be a probability measure on X and φ a continuous function on the support of
µ. The semi-norm k · kL2(µ,pφ) on H 0(X, Lp) is deﬁned as in (2.1) and recall that we only
consider measures µ for which this semi-norm is a norm. Let B2
p(µ, φ) denote the unit ball
in H 0(X, Lp) with respect to this norm and Np := dim H 0(X, Lp). Consider the following
Lp-functional

(3.1)

Lp(µ, φ) :=

1

2pNp

log vol B2

p(µ, φ).

LARGE DEVIATIONS PRINCIPLE FOR SOME BETA ENSEMBLES

13

Here, vol denotes the Lebesgue measure on the vector space H 0(X, Lp) which depends
on the choice of an Euclidean norm on H 0(X, Lp). So the volume is only deﬁned up to a
multiplicative constant. Nevertheless, the differences such as Lp(µ1, φ1) − Lp(µ2, φ2) are
well-deﬁned and do not depend on the choice of vol for any probability measures µ1 and
µ2, see [2] and also (3.2) below.

Consider the norm k · kL∞(K,pφ) on H 0(X, Lp) deﬁned in (2.1). Let B∞

p (K, φ) denote the

unit ball in H 0(X, Lp) with respect to this norm. Deﬁne

Lp(K, φ) :=

1

2pNp

log vol B∞

p (K, φ).

Let {s1, . . . , sNp} be an orthonormal basis of H 0(X, Lp) with respect to the above L2-

norm, see (2.1).

Deﬁnition 3.3. We call Bergman function of Lp, associated with (µ, φ), the function
ρp(µ, φ) on the support of µ given by

ρp(µ, φ)(x) := supn|s(x)|2

pφ : s ∈ H 0(X, Lp), kskL2(µ,pφ) = 1o =

Np

Xj=1

|sj(x)|2
pφ

and we deﬁne the Bergman measure associated with (µ, φ) by

Bp(µ, φ) := N −1

p ρp(µ, φ)µ.

It is not difﬁcult to obtain the identity in the deﬁnition of ρp(µ, φ) and to check that
Bp(µ, φ) is a probability measure. Note also that when µ is the average of Np Dirac
masses at generic points, one can easily deduce from Deﬁnition 3.3 that Bp(µ, φ) = µ, by
considering sections vanishing on supp(µ) except at a point. Such sections exist because
Np = dim H 0(X, Lp). In fact, this property holds for all points x1, . . . , xNp such that the
section det Sp considered in Introduction does not vanish at (x1, . . . , xNp).

Lemma 3.4.

(a) The functional φ 7→ Lp(µ, φ) is concave on the space of all continuous

weights on the support of µ.

(b) The directional derivative of Lp(µ, ·) at a continuous weight φ on the support of µ is

given by the integration against the Bergman measure Bp(µ, φ), that is,

= hv, Bp(µ, φ)i, with v, φ continuous on the support of µ.

Lp(µ, φ + tv)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

(c) Let µ be a probability measure with supp(µ) ⊂ K such that the L2-semi-norm in

(2.1) is a norm. Assume also that (K, φ) is a regular weighted compact set. Then

Lp(K, φ) = Lp(X, PKφ) and Lp(K, φ) ≤ Lp(µ, φ).

Proof. The concavity property of the functional Lp in Part (a) has been established in [3,
Proposition 2.4]. Part (b) has been established in [2, Lemma 5.1]. The property was
stated there for smooth φ but the proof also works for continuous functions, see also [4,
Lemma 3.1] and [11, Lemma 2]. For Part (c), see [9, Proposition 2.5, Lemma 3.4]. (cid:3)

From now on, in order to simplify the notation, we use the following normalization

(3.2)

Eeq(X, 0) = 0, Lp(X, 0) = 0 and Lp(µ0, 0) = 0

for

p ≥ 1.

Here, the function identically 0 is used as a smooth strictly ω0-p.s.h. weight. Recall also
that µ0 = kωn

0 is the probability measure associated with the volume form ωn
0 .

The following result is an immediate consequence of [9, Proposition 3.10]. Recall that
C k,α = C k+α for 0 ≤ α < 1 and C k,1 is the space of C k functions whose partial derivatives
of order k are Lipschitz.

Proposition 3.5. Let 0 < α ≤ 1 and A > 0 be constants. Let φ be an ω0-p.s.h. weight of
class C 0,α on X such that kφkC 0,α ≤ A. Then, there is a constant cA,α > 0 depending only
on X, L, ω0, A and α such that we have for all p > 1

and

where βα := α/(6 + 3α).

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:0)Lp(X, φ) − Eeq(X, φ)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ cA,α(log p)3βαp−βα,

For the following proposition, we refer to the discussion after Theorem 3.1 for the

notation.

Proposition 3.6. Let K be a compact subset of X. Let 0 < α ≤ 2 and 0 < α′ ≤ 1 be
constants. Assume that (K, φ) is a weighted compact set with φ ∈ C α(K) such that K is
(C α, C α′)-regular. Then there is a constant c > 0 with the following property. For p ≥ 1 and
x = (x1, . . . , xNp) ∈ K Np, denote by µx the empirical measure associated with x and let Sp
be a basis of H 0(X, Lp). Deﬁne

σx :=

1

pNp

log k det SpkL∞(K,pφ) −

1

log k det Sp(x)kpφ.

We have for all p > 1

|Lp(µx, φ) − Eeq(K, φ)| ≤ c(cid:0)p−1 log p + σx +(cid:12)(cid:12)Lp(µ0, PKφ) − Eeq(K, φ)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:1).

Proof. Observe that σx does not depend on the choice of Sp. So choose Sp which is an
orthonormal basis of H 0(X, Lp) with respect to the L2 -norm without weight. Let µp be
the empirical measure associated with a Fekete conﬁguration of order p. Using identity

Subtracting the last line from the previous one and using (3.1), we obtain

On the other hand, with the normalization (3.2), [9, Proposition 3.12] tells us that there
is a constant c > 0 satisfying

|Lp(µp, φ) − Eeq(K, φ)| ≤ c(cid:0)p−1 log p +(cid:12)(cid:12)Lp(µ0, PKφ) − Eeq(K, φ)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:1)

The following two lemmas were obtained in [9, Lemmas 3.13 and 3.14].

Lemma 3.7. There is a constant c > 0 such that for every continuous weight φ on K and
every function v of class C 1,1 on X, we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)hµeq(K, φ + tv) − µeq(K, φ), vi(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ c|t|kvkL∞(K)kddcvk∞ for

Lemma 3.8. Let ǫ > 0 and M > 0 be constants. Let F and G be functions deﬁned on
[−ǫ1/2, ǫ1/2] such that

t ∈ R.

(i) F (t) ≥ G(t) − ǫ and |F (0) − G(0)| ≤ ǫ;
(ii) F is concave on [−ǫ1/2, ǫ1/2] and differentiable at 0;
(iii) G is differentiable in [−ǫ1/2, ǫ1/2], and its derivative G′ satisﬁes |G′(t) − G′(0)| ≤

Mǫ1/2 for t ∈ [−ǫ1/2, ǫ1/2]. The last inequality holds when |G′(t) − G′(0)| ≤ M|t|.

Then we have

|F ′(0) − G′(0)| ≤ (2 + M)ǫ1/2.

End of the proof of Theorem 3.1. By (1.3), we only need to consider the case γ = 2,
i.e., to prove that

for every test C 2 function v such that kvkC 2 ≤ 1. Recall that α′′ := α′/(24 + 12α′).

Deﬁne

F (t) := Lp(µx, φ + tv)

and

for t in a neighborhood of 0 ∈ R. By Lemma 3.4(c),

Lp(µx, φ + tv) ≥ Lp(K, φ + tv) = Lp(X, PK(φ + tv)).

As 0 < α ≤ 2, we infer φ + tv ∈ C α(K). Since K is (C α, C α′)-regular, we deduce that
PK(φ + tv) is an ω0-p.s.h. weight on X with bounded C α′-norm. This, coupled with the
second inequality in Proposition 3.5, applied to PK(φ + tv) and α′ instead of α, shows
that

An application of the ﬁrst inequality in Proposition 3.5 for α′ instead of α gives

On the other hand, by Lemma 3.2, G is differentiable with
G′(t) = hv, µeq(K, φ + tv)i.

(3.4)

Finally, by Lemma 3.7, condition (iii) in Lemma 3.8 is satisﬁed for a suitable constant
M > 0. Combining this and the discussion between (3.3)-(3.4), we are in the position to
apply Lemma 3.8 to a constant ǫ of order p−4α′′(log p)12α′′ +σx. Using the above expression
for F ′(0) and G′(0), we get

We continue the proof of the main theorem. We need the following result which is a

consequence of [2, Lemma 5.3].

0 ≤ log k det SpkL∞(K,pφ) − log k det SpkL2(µ,pφ) ≤ cNpp1−δ.

Here, similar to the discussion after Theorem 3.1, the norm k det SpkL2(µ,pφ) is deﬁned
using the product probability measure µ⊗Np on K Np ⊂ X Np together with the metric and
weight for (Lp)⊠Np, naturally induced by h0 and φ.

Since µ is a probability measure, we have

k det SpkL∞(K,pφ) ≥ k det SpkL2(µ,pφ).

Now, to complete the proof of (3.5), we only need to show that

(3.6)

log k det SpkL∞(K,pφ) ≤ log k det SpkL2(µ,pφ) + O(Npp1−δ).

By (2.2), we get

|s(x)|2

pφ ≤ A2e2Ap1−δ

ksk2

L2(µ,pφ)

for every section s ∈ H 0(X, Lp), p ≥ 1, and x ∈ X. If x1, . . . , xNp are points in X, then for
each j

x 7→ det Sp(x1, . . . , xj−1, x, xj+1, . . . , xNp)

is a holomorphic section in H 0(X, Lp). A successive application of the last inequality for
j = 1, 2, . . . , Np and Fubini’s theorem yield

k det Spk2

L∞(K,pφ) ≤ A2Npe2ANpp1−δ

k det Spk2

L2(µ,pφ).

Estimates (3.6) and (3.5) follow.

Recall that Np = O(pn) and by Stirling’s formula Np! ≈ (Np/e)Npp2πNp. Therefore,

Lemma 3.9 implies

1

pNp

log k det SpkL2(µ,pφ) =

1

pNp

logpNp! = O(p−1 log p).

It follows from (3.5) that

(3.7)

0 ≤

pNp

log k det SpkL∞(K,pφ) ≤ c1p−δ with some constant

c1 > 0.

Let λ0 > 0 be a constant whose value will be determined later. For every p ≥ 1,

consider the set

Ep := nx ∈ K Np :

1

pNp

log k det Sp(x)kpφ ≤ −λ0p−δo.

So for x ∈ K Np \ Ep, using (3.7), we obtain σx ≤ (c1 + λ0)p−δ, where as above

σx :=

1

pNp

log k det SpkL∞(K,pφ) −

1

pNp

log k det Sp(x)kpφ.

Hence, applying Theorem 3.1 yields

distγ(µx, µeq(K, φ)) ≤ cp−α′′γ(log p)3α′′γ + cp−γδ/4,

for some constant c > 0.

To complete the proof of the theorem, it remains to bound the size of Ep. Fix a constant

λ as in Theorem 1.2. Consider two different cases according to the value of β.
Case 1. Assume that β ≥ 2. Choose λ0 = λ/β. We ﬁrst bound the mass of k det Spkβ
pφµ⊗Np
from below. Recall that µ⊗Np is a probability measure. Applying H¨older’s inequality and
using Lemma 3.9, we obtain

Z k det Spkβ
p ≤ k det Spkβ

pφdµ⊗Np ≥ (cid:16)Z k det Spk2
pφµ⊗Np. Hence, by deﬁnition of Ep, we get

pφdµ⊗Np(cid:17)β/2

= (Np!)β/2.

Consequently, νβ

p (Ep) ≤ ZEp

k det Sp(x)kβ

pφdµ⊗Np(x) ≤ ZEp

e−λp1−δNpdµ⊗Np(x) ≤ e−λp1−δ Np.

This completes the proof for the case β ≥ 2.

Case 2. Assume that 0 < β ≤ 2. Combining (3.7) and Lemma 3.9, we get

ZK Np

k det(S)kβ

pφdµ⊗Np ≥ e−(2−β)c1p1−δNp ZK Np

k det(S)k2

pφdµ⊗Np ≥ e−(2−β)c1p1−δNp.

Consequently,

Hence, we infer

p ≤ e(2−β)c1p1−δNpk det Spkβ
νβ

pφµ⊗Np.

νβ

p (Ep) ≤ e(2−β)c1p1−δNp ZEp
≤ e(2−β)c1p1−δNp ZEp

Choose λ0 ≫ c1 and the result follows. This ends the proof of our main theorem.

(cid:3)

As mentioned above, Theorem 3.1 can be applied to other situations. We present now
one more application. Consider the same setting as in Theorem 3.1 and a probability
measure µ on K. Recall the following notion, see [3].

Deﬁnition 3.10. Let 0 < r ≤ ∞ and 0 < r′ ≤ ∞. We say that y ∈ K Np is an (r, r′)-optimal
conﬁguration of order p if the following function in x ∈ K Np
kskLr(µ,pφ)
kskLr′ (µx,pφ)

s∈H 0(X,Lp)\{0}

τx :=

sup

attains its minimum at y.

We have the following elementary property, see also [3, Proposition 2.10].

Lemma 3.11. If y ∈ K Np is (r, r′)-optimal, then τy ≤ N 1+1/r′

p

Proof. Let x = (x1, . . . , xNp) be a Fekete conﬁguration of order p. We only need to check
that τx ≤ N 1+1/r′
. Choose a basis Sp = (s1, . . . , sNp) of H 0(X, Lp) such that si(xj) = 0
when i 6= j and ksi(xi)kpφ = 1. Since x is a Fekete conﬁguration, we have k det Sp(·)kpφ ≤
1 on K Np. This inequality on Ki := {x1}×· · ·×{xi−1}×K×{xi+1}×· · ·×{xNp} implies that
ksi(·)kpφ ≤ 1 on K. Finally, if s is a section in H 0(X, Lp)\{0}, write s = λ1s1 +· · ·+λNpsNp
and we have

kskLr(µ,pφ)
kskLr′ (µx,pφ)

≤

The lemma follows.

(cid:3)

We deduce from Theorem 3.1 the following result, where the simple convergence of

µy when p → ∞ was established in [3].

Corollary 3.12. In the setting of Theorem 1.2, consider two numbers 0 < r, r′ ≤ ∞. There
is a constant c > 0 such that if y is an (r, r′)-optimal conﬁguration of order p for some p > 1,
then

distγ(µy, µeq(K, φ)) ≤ cqγ.

Proof. We only have to check that

σx ≤ c(p−1 log τx + p−δ)

for x ∈ K Np

for some constant c > 0. Then, Theorem 3.1, Lemma 3.11 and the estimate Np = O(pn)
imply the result.

We can assume that det Sp(x) 6= 0 because the case det Sp(x) = 0 is trivial. So we can
choose Sp = (s1, . . . , sNp) as in the proof of Lemma 3.11, but here x is no more a Fekete
conﬁguration. By deﬁnition of τx, we have

ksikLr(µ,pφ) ≤ τxksikLr′ (µx,pφ) = N −1/r′

p

τx ≤ τx.

Hence, it follows from Lemma 2.5 that

ksikL∞(K,pφ) ≤ A′eA′p1−δ

τx.

Therefore, we get

k det Sp(·)kpφ ≤ Np!(cid:0)A′eA′p1−δ

τx(cid:1)Np

on K Np.

We then deduce the desired estimate using the deﬁnition of σx and that k det Sp(x)kpφ = 1
by the choice of Sp.
