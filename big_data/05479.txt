ABSTRACT

The Large Early Galaxy Census (LEGA-Ca) is a Public Spectroscopic Survey of ∼ 3200 K-band
selected galaxies at redshifts z = 0.6− 1.0 with stellar masses M∗ > 1010 M(cid:12), conducted with VIMOS
on ESO’s Very Large Telescope. The survey is embedded in the COSMOS ﬁeld (R.A. = 10h00;
Dec. = +2 deg). The 20-hour long integrations produce high-S/N continuum spectra that reveal
ages, metallicities and velocity dispersions of the stellar populations. LEGA-C’s unique combination
of sample size and depth will enable us for the ﬁrst time to map the stellar content at large look-back
time, across galaxies of diﬀerent types and star-formation activity. Observations started in December
2014 and are planned to be completed by mid 2018, with early data releases of the spectra and value-
added products. In this paper we present the science case, the observing strategy, an overview of
the data reduction process and data products, and a ﬁrst look at the relationship between galaxy
structure and spectral properties, as it existed 7 Gyr ago.

INTRODUCTION

Our understanding of galaxy evolution at late cos-
mic epochs has been revolutionized by spectra from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (York et al. 2000): their high
signal-to-noise and high resolution have allowed accurate
measurements of the (light-weighted) integrated stellar
ages and metallicities of galaxies (e.g., Kauﬀmann et al.
2003a; Gallazzi et al. 2005). These data have brought
into clear focus the multi-variate correlations between
stellar population properties and mass (Kauﬀmann et al.
2003b), structure (e.g., concentration, bulge-to-disk ra-
tio; Kauﬀmann et al. 2003b), size (van der Wel et al.
2009), stellar velocity dispersion (Gallazzi et al. 2006;

Graves et al. 2009), nuclear activity (Kauﬀmann et al.
2003c; Schawinski et al. 2009), and environment (Kauﬀ-
mann et al. 2004; Pasquali et al. 2010; Thomas et al.
2010), which have greatly illuminated the processes that
drive star-formation and ongoing assembly of present-day
galaxies. The main limitation of examining present-day
galaxies for the purpose of reconstructing their forma-
tion history is that most of the star formation occurred
in the distant past: mean stellar ages of L∗ galaxies are
typically well over 5 Gyr and it is diﬃcult to resolve star
formation histories from integrated spectra.
Now LEGA-C is obtaining spectra of similar quality
for ∼3200 K-band selected galaxies in the redshift range
0.6 < z < 1.0, at a look-back time of 6− 8 Gyr. LEGA-C
is a 4-year, 128-night Public Spectroscopic Survey with
VLT/VIMOS (Le F`evre et al. 2003), one of the most
extensive extra-galactic surveys on an 8-10m-class tele-
scope, and unique in its combination of depth and reso-
lution. We know that ∼50% of all stars in the universe
formed since z ∼ 1 (e.g., Dickinson et al. 2003; Rudnick
et al. 2003; Ilbert et al. 2010; Muzzin et al. 2013b). As
a consequence, 8 Gyr ago galaxies must have had very
diﬀerent stellar populations. Yet, we have not diagnosed
spectroscopically those properties for samples of more
than a few dozen individual objects (Jørgensen et al.
2005; Jørgensen & Chiboucas 2013; Choi et al. 2014;
Gallazzi et al. 2014; Belli et al. 2015), and we do not
know what processes drive the star-formation and as-
sembly history of the galaxy population. The LEGA-C
spectra provide us with a unique opportunity to combine
the advantages of the ‘archaeological’ approach to galaxy
formation with the power of the look-back approach.
We know that galaxies at z ∼ 1 (and beyond) show
a wide variety in structure and star-formation activity
(e.g., Conselice et al. 2011; Mortlock et al. 2013), but
also that, like in the present-day universe, these proper-
ties are correlated (e.g., Trujillo et al. 2006; Franx et al.
2008; Bell et al. 2012; van der Wel et al. 2014). Knowl-
edge of the stellar ages and metallicities is crucial to un-

The LEGA-C Survey

derstand the star formation history, and stellar veloc-
ity dispersions are a crucial element in quantifying the
dynamical scaling relations such the Faber & Jackson
(1976) relation, the Tully & Fisher (1977), and the fun-
damental plane (Djorgovski & Davis 1987; Dressler et al.
1987), the evolution of which have proved to be key in
constraining galaxy formation models (e.g., Franx 1993;
van Dokkum et al. 1998; Holden et al. 2005; van der Wel
et al. 2005; Treu et al. 2005; Bezanson et al. 2013, 2015).
Furthermore, the underlying relationships between the
stellar content of galaxies and their mass, ongoing star
formation, internal structure, environment, and nuclear
activity can be explored at large look-back time for the
ﬁrst time by the LEGA-C dataset.

The LEGA-C survey can play a crucial and unique role
in the context of previous, current, and upcoming devel-
opments in the ﬁeld of galaxy evolution. Wide-area sur-
veys with HST such as COSMOS (Scoville et al. 2007)
and CANDELS (Grogin et al. 2011; Koekemoer et al.
2011) have been completed, producing a high-resolution
imaging data set, essentially ‘frozen’ until JWST and Eu-
clid start operation. After several years with a focus on
deep imaging campaigns, the deep spectroscopic eﬀort to
probe the stellar light of distant galaxies has fallen be-
hind. Furthermore, ALMA is measuring cold gas masses
for increasingly large samples of galaxies (e.g., Carilli &
Walter 2013; Decarli et al. 2014; Scoville et al. 2015).
The interplay between stellar populations, ongoing star
formation and the available reservoirs for future star for-
mation make for a powerful combination to reconstruct
and predict galaxy evolution. Finally, in 2019 the JWST
should start operation, marking the beginning of a new
era in which JWST and new, large ground-based tele-
scopes will explore the physical properties of galaxies at
z ∼ 2 and beyond. Because the vast majority of all
stars formed between z ∼ 2 and the present, connect-
ing the galaxy populations at z > 2 and the present is
an intractable problem without the intermediate redshift
benchmark sample that LEGA-C provides. Yet, JWST
is lacking spectroscopic capabilities at λ < 1µm, leaving
many established spectral diagnostics of stellar popula-
tions inaccessible; crucially LEGA-C ﬁlls this gap.

The main goal of this paper is to introduce the LEGA-
C survey. In particular, we outline its scientiﬁc goals in
Section 2), describe in detail the survey design, observa-
tional strategy and data reduction/analysis in Section 3,
and present ﬁrst-look results in Section 4.

2. GOALS OF LEGA-C

The LEGA-C observations produce S/N > 10 ˚A

−1
spectra for ∼3200 K-band selected galaxies with red-
shifts in the range 0.6 < z < 1.0 (or a look-back
time of 6 − 8 Gyr) and over the wavelength range ∼
6300˚A−8800˚A. Our simple K-band selection (see below)
is close to a stellar mass selection and blind to almost any
other galaxy property. We chose a K-band limit instead
of a (model-dependent) stellar mass limit to conserve the
legacy value of the dataset even if our current methods
to estimate stellar masses were to prove incomplete or
systematically incorrect. The LEGA-C spectra provide
accurate measurements of

• Balmer absorption and emission line strengths;
• Metal absorption and emission features;

• Stellar and ionized gas velocity dispersions;
• Emission line ﬂuxes, widths and ratios.

These measurements have a wide range of applications
that are of interest to a large segment of the community,
and each of the topics described below constitutes a large
science program. Here, we only list the main features of
each science case.

2.1. Stellar Population Ages

The strength of the Balmer absorption lines and the
spectral region around D4000 are the most sensitive di-
agnostics of stellar population age (e.g., Kauﬀmann et al.
2003a; Wild et al. 2009). The age distribution of stellar
populations at a look-back time of 6 − 8 Gyr is one of
the main legacy data products of the survey. Gallazzi
et al. (2005) and Thomas et al. (2010) measured the age
distribution for present-day galaxies. Combined with the
observed distribution of star-formation across the mass
function (e.g., Karim et al. 2011) this can be used to pre-
dict the evolution of the age distribution under diﬀerent
assumptions (growth through in situ star formation only;
merging). By measuring the distribution of stellar ages 7
Gyr ago (e.g., Gallazzi et al. 2014) the creation of stellar
mass and its migration across the mass function can be
reconstructed.
In particular, this allows us to address
the following, inter-related topics.

2.1.1. Quenching

The continuous increase in the number density of pas-
sive galaxies from z = 1 to the present (e.g., Bell et al.
2004; Faber et al. 2007) implies that signiﬁcant num-
bers of star-forming galaxies have their star-forming ac-
tivity quenched and then largely remain quiescent. What
causes this and how quickly this happens, and whether
it is preceded by a burst of star formation is widely dis-
cussed, but remains an unsettled problem.

AGN feedback, owing to large available energies and
evidence for AGN driven outﬂows and bubbles (e.g., Mc-
Namara & Nulsen 2007; Nesvadba et al. 2008; Genzel
et al. 2014) has long been a strong candidate for driving
Galaxy wide quenching of star formation (e.g., Di Mat-
teo et al. 2005; Croton et al. 2006; Hopkins et al. 2006).
This idea is consistent with the correlation of quiescence
with the amount of stellar mass in galaxy centers: con-
centration (Kauﬀmann et al. 2003b; Franx et al. 2008;
Bell 2008; Bell et al. 2012), velocity dispersion (Franx
et al. 2008; Wake et al. 2012), central stellar mass sur-
face density (Fang et al. 2013), or bulge mass (Lang et al.
2014); in the local universe all these quantities correlate
strongly with black hole mass, lending support to the
AGN feedback picture. However, a direct causal connec-
tion has been diﬃcult to prove, and perhaps the mere
presence of a dense body of evolved stars prevents the
formation of a large number of new stars (e.g., Martig
et al. 2009; Conroy et al. 2015).

The demographics of recently quenched galaxies shed
light on this: the fraction of galaxies displaying spec-
tral signs of rapidly reduced recent star formation activ-
ity and preceding bursts (e.g., strong Balmer absorption
lines, but no emission lines – e.g., Wild et al. (2009) –
constrains the quenching rate, speed, and mode.

2.1.2. Star Formation and Galaxy Structure

The connection between quiescence and galaxy struc-
ture is a speciﬁc instance of a general connection between
star formation history and galaxy structure: among star-
forming galaxies the instantaneous SFR depends on con-
centration (Whitaker et al. 2015), and it has been argued
that bulge fraction is the driving factor (Abramson et al.
2014; Lang et al. 2014). This explains to some extent, but
not fully, the scatter in SFR at ﬁxed galaxy mass. With
age measurements for star-forming galaxies the contri-
bution of temporal variations in SFR to the scatter in
the so-called star-forming Main Sequence (Noeske et al.
2007) can be constrained. Furthermore, as ALMA will
start measuring cold gas masses of large samples of galax-
ies (Decarli et al. 2014; Scoville et al. 2015) the correla-
tions between star formation, galactic structure and gas
fraction provide additional constraints on the short- and
long-term variations in star formation activity.

2.2. Metallicities

The LEGA-C dataset provides the ﬁrst simultaneous
systematic measurement of the stellar and gas phase
metal content of the galaxy population at a large look-
back time.

2.2.1. Stellar metallicity

The strength of stellar absorption features such as the
Fe and Mg lines constrain the metal content and, hence,
the metal enrichment history of galaxies as they are pro-
duced at diﬀerent stages of the evolution of a stellar pop-
ulation. Through the comparison with the present-day
galaxy population, and in combination with the age mea-
surements, the abundance measurements put new and
independent constraints on the amount of star formation
and chemical enrichment of galaxies over the past 8 Gyr.
Previous studies at z > 0.5 were limited to small sam-
ples of very high-mass galaxies or used co-added spectra
(Schiavon et al. 2006; Jørgensen & Chiboucas 2013; Gal-
lazzi et al. 2014). With the large dynamic range in mass
and larger sample size we can now measure the intrinsic
scatter and mass dependence, which is crucial for inter-
preting the redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity re-
−1
lation. For several hundred spectra with S/N > 30˚A
the α/Fe abundance ratio can be quantiﬁed. This re-
veals to what extent the most massive galaxies have had
their stellar populations diluted by late star formation
and accretion of externally formed stars (mergers).

2.2.2. Gas phase metallicity

The standard indicators of the oxygen abundance (as
a proxy of gas-phase metallicity) Hβ, [OII]λ3727, and
[OIII]λ5007 (Kewley & Ellison 2008) are available for the
∼1300 galaxies at redshift z ∼ 0.8 and below. For the
remainder one must rely on the other Balmer lines and
[OII]λ3727. The detection of (or useful upper limit on)
the faint [OIII]λ4363 line in the deep spectra constrains
the electron temperature and therefore breaks the degen-
eracy between metallicity and electron temperature.

2.3. Kinematics

2.3.1. Dynamical masses

Our knowledge of the evolution of the mass function
of galaxies relies on photometry-based stellar mass esti-
mates, which depend on a range of assumptions regard-
ing the star-formation history, the metal content, the
dust content (and its extinction law and geometry), and
the stellar initial mass function. Comparisons with dy-
namical mass measurements have been carried out across
galaxies of diﬀerent types in the present-day universe
(e.g., Gallazzi et al. 2006; Taylor et al. 2010), but the nec-
essary measurements (stellar velocity dispersions) have
so far been lacking at higher redshifts, with the excep-
tion of small samples of massive early-type galaxies (van
der Wel et al. 2006; Rettura et al. 2006; Kannappan &
Gawiser 2007; van de Sande et al. 2015).
The 5-10% accurate stellar velocity dispersions from
the high-S/N , high-resolution (∼ 50km/s) LEGA-C
spectra, combined with HST-based sizes and Sersic in-
dices, provide precise dynamical mass measurements.
The dynamical masses calibrate stellar mass measure-
ments. Furthermore, diﬀerences between dynamical and
stellar mass estimates can constrain contributions from
dark matter, gas, and IMF variations, and be distin-
guished by means of cold gas measurements from ALMA,
increasing further the accuracy of the work based on gas
dynamics (e.g., Erb et al. 2006; F¨orster Schreiber et al.
2009; Law et al. 2009; Epinat et al. 2009; Erb et al. 2014).

2.3.2. Scaling relations

The measurement of stellar velocity dispersions and
the already available structural parameters from HST
imaging allow a detailed description of the dynamical
scaling relations. The Faber & Jackson (1976) relation
and Fundamental Plane (Dressler et al. 1987; Djorgovski
& Davis 1987) for early-type galaxies are mapped out
at z ∼ 1 over a large range in galaxy mass of over an
order in magnitude, addressing the lingering dispute on
the evolution of the Fundamental Plane tilt (van der Wel
et al. 2005; Treu et al. 2005; Holden et al. 2010).

For late-type galaxies the Tully & Fisher (1977) re-
lation can be reconstructed by statistically deproject-
ing the emission and/or absorption line widths to de-
rive the circular velocity (Rix et al. 1997; Kassin et al.
2007; Maseda et al. 2013). The LEGA-C dataset provides
the important opportunity to test ionized gas kinematics
with stellar kinematics and calibrate dynamical masses
based on emission line widths, building further on pre-
vious work (e.g., Vogt et al. 1996; Ziegler et al. 2002;
B¨ohm & Ziegler 2007; Kassin et al. 2007; van Starken-
burg et al. 2008; Puech et al. 2008; Gnerucci et al. 2011;
Miller et al. 2011, 2012). The evolution of these scal-
ing relations across 8 Gyr provides stringent constraints
on the growth modes of galaxies such as inside-out disk
growth (Miller et al. 2011; Dutton et al. 2011) and merg-
ing (Naab et al. 2009; Johansson et al. 2012).

3. DATA

3.1. Sample Selection

The parent sample is the photometric sample from
Muzzin et al. (2013a). Their UltraVISTA K-band se-
lected catalog is 90% complete down to K = 23.4 and
contains 160,070 sources across 1.62 square degrees in the
COSMOS ﬁeld (R.A.= 10h00m; Dec.= +2◦12(cid:48)). On top
of the near-IR VISTA imaging data (McCracken et al.

The LEGA-C Survey

Figure 1. Stellar mass and color distribution of the galaxies in the LEGA-C primary sample. In light gray we show the full UltraVISTA
catalog from (Muzzin et al. 2013a) for the redshift range 0.6 < z < 1.0. In black we show the K band-limited parent sample – the red
dashed line in the left-hand panel shows the approximate mass limit that corresponds with our K-band limit – and in red we overlay the
primary sample that is included in the survey. The sample straddles the characteristic galaxy mass, M∗, and spans the full observed color
range, that is, SED type.

2012), Muzzin et al. collected and consolidated the avail-
able photometric information across 30 passbands rang-
ing over 2 orders of magnitude in wavelength, from 0.2µm
to 24µm micron. Photometric redshifts were measured
by Muzzin et al. using EAZY (Brammer et al. 2008).
Cross-matching with the Davies et al. (2015) catalog re-
sults in 21,267 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts.

Our sample selection procedure is summarized in Ta-
ble 1. Our primary sample16 for the selection of LEGA-
C targets consists of 9,920 galaxies brighter than K =
20.7 − 7.5 × log((1 + z)/1.8) and 0.6 < z < 1.0 (spec-
troscopic or photometric). That is, our primary sam-
ple is K-band selected, with a redshift-dependent mag-
nitude limit that ranges from K = 21.08 at z = 0.6 to
K = 20.7 at z = 0.8 to K = 20.36 at z = 1.0. The
redshift-dependent K-band limit ensures that primary
targets are suﬃciently bright in the spectroscopically ob-
served wavelength range (0.6µm − 0.9µm) to produce a
high-quality spectrum, while retaining the advantages of
selecting galaxies in the rest-frame near-IR, namely the
reduced dependence on variations in age, star-formation
activity and extinction.

The basic physical parameters of the galaxies in the
primary sample are shown in Figure 1. For all stellar
masses larger than ∼ 1010 M(cid:12) we sample the full range
of SED types, from blue to dusty, from star-forming to
passive. We note that thanks to our K-band selection
(rather than, e.g., stellar mass) our sample is not strongly
biased against particular sub-types of galaxies, such as
extremely obscured or emission line-dominated objects.
The sample size of ∼ 3200 and the mass range are mo-

16 The primary and ﬁller samples are pre-selected to include only
those objects in the UltraVISTA catalog that are not classiﬁed as
stars and have USE ﬂag with value 1, indicating ‘good photometric
quality’ – see Muzzin et al. (2013a) for details.

tivated by the measurement precision and by the goal of
studying the intrinsic scatter in galaxy properties. We
require these to be the same: in order to decide whether
two sets of galaxies diﬀer in terms of, e.g., age by more
than the intrinsic scatter in age, each set needs to contain
∼80 galaxies (for a 3σ result). The galaxies span a range
in stellar mass of over 1.5 orders of magnitude (Figure 1,
left). Given measurement uncertainties of 0.1-0.2 dex in
stellar and dynamical masses, sets of galaxies should be
chosen within ∼ 0.3 dex mass ranges. That is, the survey
will probe 6 independent mass bins. The galaxy popula-
tion also shows a complex structure in color-color space
(Figure 1, right). Given ∼0.10-0.15 mag uncertainties in
the colors, sets of galaxies should be chosen within ∼0.3
mag-wide color ranges. Details of the exact deﬁnition
of color-color bins aside, approximately 6 independent
color-color bins are needed to sample the observed range
of SED types. The 6 mass and color-color bins make a
total of 36 bins, which each should contain ∼80 galax-
ies. This motivates our total sample size of about three
thousand galaxies.

The required depth of the data, obtained with 20h of
integration time, is motivated by the required precision
of the measurements, which in turn is dictated by the in-
trinsic variation of the physical parameters. For age and
metallicity the intrinsic scatter for present-day galaxies is
0.2 dex or more (depending on mass, Gallazzi et al. 2005).
That is, we need measurement uncertainties of 0.2 dex
or less in these parameters. Similarly, the intrinsic scat-
ter in velocity dispersion for galaxies of a given mass is
0.1 dex (e.g., van der Wel et al. 2008), demanding mea-
surement errors less than that. Our data in hand conﬁrm
that the obtained signal-to-noise ratio is as high as antic-
ipated (Section 4) and suﬃcient for velocity dispersion,
age, and metallicity measurements with a precision of

Additional samples are used to ﬁll remaining mask real
estate. The ﬁller sample I consists of galaxies at 1.0 <
z < 1.5 brighter than K = 20.4; the ﬁller sample II
consists of galaxies at 0.6 < z < 1.0 but fainter than the
(redshift-dependent) K-band limit applied to the primary
sample. Any remaining mask space is used for galaxies
in the redshift range 1.0 < z < 1.5 and fainter than
K = 20.4 (ﬁller sample III).

3.2. Mask Design

Four masks designs are created for each of the 7.0(cid:48)×
8.4(cid:48) VIMOS detectors. Slits are always in the N-S direc-
tion, 1(cid:48)(cid:48) in width and at least 8(cid:48)(cid:48) long. Slit assigment is
fully automated and proceeds as follows. First, primary
targets more than 100(cid:48)(cid:48) away from the detector edges in
the dispersion direction – to optimize wavelength cover-
age17 – are assigned slits, in order of their K-band ﬂux
(brightest ﬁrst). This strategy ensures that we maximize
the collected number of photons without biasing the sam-
ple toward blue, optically bright galaxies. This ﬁrst step

17 The resulting blue wavelength cutoﬀ ranges uniformly from
5800˚A to 6300˚A; the red wavelength cutoﬀ ranges uniformly from
8300˚A to 9400˚A

of slit assignment typically ﬁlls 60% of the mask. Before
proceeding with assigning additional slits to galaxies, we
include at least one blue star with spectral coverage at
the longest wavelengths to produce a telluric absorption
spectrum. Candidate blue stars are identiﬁed on the ba-
sis of their SDSS colors (g − r < 0.7). Next, galaxies
in the primary sample closer to the detector edges than
100(cid:48)(cid:48) are included in the masks, increasing the occupa-
tion of mask real estate to ∼ 75%. Next, alignment stars
are included in all four masks, followed by galaxies from
the ﬁller samples (see Table 1). An example of a mask
design is shown in Figure 3. These mask designs are fed
into ESO’s vvmps software package to produce the ﬁles
required for cutting the masks.
The ∼2(cid:48) gaps between the detectors and the 100(cid:48)(cid:48) re-
gions near the edges of the detector in the wavelength
(E-W) direction that are preferably avoided when as-
signing slits leave about half of the sky uncovered in a
single pointing. However, by interlacing the pointings
in the E-W direction, we achieve 100% coverage in that
direction, leaving only the ∼2(cid:48) detector gaps in the N-
S direction. The survey consists of 32 pointings (four
masks each), covering the 1.6 square degree UltraVISTA
footprint, and including a total of 4,027 galaxies, 3,142
of which are from the primary sample (see Table 1 for

details).

3.3. Observations

Observations are carried out in visitor mode and in
dark time. Table 2 shows past and currently scheduled
observing runs in Periods 94-96. Similar runs will be
scheduled for Periods 97-101, after which the survey will
have been completed barring large delays due to excessive
weather losses or technical problems.

The high-resolution red grating (HR red) is used in
combination with the GG475 order separation ﬁlter.
This provides a typical wavelength range of ∼ 6300˚A −
8800˚A at a resolution of R = 2500 and a dispersion of
0.6˚A pix−1.
For each pointing, we obtain 15-20 observation blocks
(OBs) of 4×900s-1200s exposures each; the total integra-
tion time per mask is 20 hours. Occasionally an OB will
be repeated as a result of degrading weather conditions,
and integration times shortened for scheduling eﬃciency.
Given the large angular sizes of many of our targets a
dithering scheme would require slits that are 12-20(cid:48)(cid:48) long
(proportional to the number of oﬀsets), compared to the
minimum of 8(cid:48)(cid:48) that we adopt in our survey.
In addi-
tion, by using the noisy sky as a background measure
we would sacriﬁce 16%-30% in depth (inversely propor-
tional to the number of oﬀsets) equivalent to losing 6-10
hours of exposure time. Combining these factors, dither-
ing would reduce the survey eﬃciency by a factor of sev-
eral. Fortunately, the low fringing amplitudes of the red-
sensitive detectors that were installed in 2008 allow us to
observe without dithering. The remaining fringing level
and problems with the subtraction of the brightest atmo-
spheric emission lines for a subset of targets are merely a
cosmetic problem (see Section 3.4) and are a far superior

choice compared to the cost of the arguably cosmetically
superior dithering approach.

To minimize overheads we deviate from the standard
procedure to obtain calibration data (ﬂats and arcs) im-
mediately after the completion of an OB, as this would
require slewing the telescope to zenith. Instead, for the
data taken between December 2014 to May 2015 we col-
lected calibration data in batches at a series of rotator
angles that correspond with the rotator angles during
the observation of the science data. This approach in-
tends to limit residual eﬀects of changes in ﬂexure and
hysteresis to a level that can be appropriately dealt with
during the data reduction process. Careful analysis of
these calibration datasets then revealed that proximity
in time elapsed between science and calibration data is
more relevant than similarity in rotator angle. There-
fore, we changed our strategy and obtain a calibration
dataset after each block of 2-2.5h science exposures.

3.4. Data Reduction

The data reduction procedure is split into two parts.
First, we use the ESO-provided pipeline to produce rec-
tiﬁed, wavelength-calibrated 2D spectra. Second, with
a custom-made pipeline we improve the wavelength cal-
ibration, perform simultaneous sky subtraction and ob-
ject extraction, and co-add the individual frames.

3.4.1. ESO pipeline

The Reﬂex interface is used to run the ESO-provided
pipeline recipes on the data from an individual OB
consisting of four exposures, producing a single, av-
eraged frame. The steps performed with the ESO
pipeline include a bias and ﬂatﬁeld correction, slit deﬁ-
nition, slit rectiﬁcation, wavelength calibration, spectro-
photometric calibration and cosmic ray rejection.

3.4.2. Custom pipeline

There are three main reasons for switching to a custom-
made set of data reduction recipes at this point to further
process the OB-level, combined exposures. First, the VI-
MOS mask design software forces gaps between the slits
of only 2 pixels (0.4(cid:48)(cid:48)), causing bleeding of bright skylines
into the neighboring slits, making sky subtraction more
diﬃcult. Second, the alignment between the science and
calibration frames is imperfect due to ﬂexure, which re-
quires reducing the length of the slits across which sky
subtraction is performed. Third, our non-dithering strat-
egy outlined above requires that object extraction and
sky subtraction are done simultaneously.

2D error spectra are calculated from the ﬂux in the sci-
ence frames and the read noise level. Slit deﬁnitions are
automatically veriﬁed and adjusted. Using the expected
location of a target galaxy as an initial estimate, the size
and precise location are measured by ﬁtting a Gaussian
proﬁle in the spatial direction after summing along a 1000
pixel range in the wavelength direction. This location is
then traced along the entire wavelength range in bins of
100 pixels. For ∼10% of the targets in each mask there is
insuﬃcient ﬂux to do this, and the location is assumed to
be the expected location and independent of wavelength.
Secondary objects in the slits are extracted separately.

The default model for sky+galaxy is a ﬂat background
with a Gaussian proﬁle of a ﬁxed width and location (as
measured above). That is, the two free parameters are
the amplitude of the Gaussian (the galaxy ﬂux) and the
sky background level. This model is ﬁt to each individual
wavelength bin, across the spatial direction, weighed by
the error spectrum.

This simple model does not always produce a suﬃ-
ciently accurate description of the data, as made appar-
ent by systematic residuals. In such cases a ﬁrst-order
term is added to the background model for areas where
the sky level is high or the gradient in the sky level in
the wavelength direction is large.

This data reduction process produces individual ex-
tracted galaxy spectra and their associated error spectra
(for each of the 15-20 OBs, totalling 20 hours of expo-
sure time). Each of these are corrected for telluric ab-

sorption features as follows: the continuum of the blue
star spectrum is ﬁt by a 5-th order polynomial over the
regions that do not contain telluric absorption features,
and divided out. All galaxy spectra are then divided
by the resulting telluric spectrum. These are then co-
added, weighed by the S/N as measured in the observed
wavelength range 8030˚A− 8270˚A, which is relatively de-
void of bright sky lines. Finally, the ﬂux is measured
over the wavelength range 7000˚A − 8400˚A and normal-
ized to match the photometric i+-band ﬂux of the ob-
ject. This remedies errors in the automatic spectro-
photometric calibration that can arise due to varying
transparency during the observations. The accuracy of
the calibration is better than 5%, but due varying slit
losses (which range from 10%-40%) the precision varies
from galaxy to galaxy. As a higher-level data product we
will provide, in the future, a new, wavelength-dependent
ﬂux calibration based on matching the shape of the spec-
trum to that of the full photometric spectroscopic energy
distribution, as well as a model for the slit losses.

As mentioned above, our observing strategy is aimed
at maximizing the survey eﬃciency and depth by not
dithering, a choice that comes at the cost of retaining
some cosmetic ﬂaws as a result of low-level fringing and
imperfections in the sky subtraction of the brightest at-
mospheric emission lines that occur when data are ob-
tained under sub-optimal weather conditions and for ob-
jects that are near the edges of the detectors. The result-
ing features are illustrated in Figure 4. We stress that,
in total, only about 2-3% of the pixels suﬀer from such
problems, and those are wavelength regions where the
night sky is bright anyway, implying that only low-S/N
data is lost.

3.5. Spectral Fitting – Redshifts, Stellar Population

Properties and Velocity Dispersions

Redshifts are measured by cross-correlating with a
small set of general template spectra. In 98% of the cases
our redshifts are within the targeted range of z = 0.6−1.0
and vidually veriﬁed. Among the 2% of galaxies that fall
outside this range (18 objects), nine are only marginally
lower than z = 0.6 or higher than z = 1.0 (∆z (cid:46) 0.02),

8

The LEGA-C Survey

Figure 4. To illustrate the S/N of the data and the quality of the sky subtraction we show co-added 2-dimensional spectra of 8 galaxies
over the wavelength range 8260˚A − 8760˚A, chosen for its bright, telluric emission lines. The bottom row shows the variance spectrum of
the galaxy spectrum right above it, to indicate which parts are clean and which parts are aﬀected by the telluric lines. These 8 examples
show the full range in the quality of sky subraction. The quality of the sky subtraction (see Section 3.4.2 for a description of the algorithm)
at the locations of the brightest atmospheric features varies from galaxy to galaxy due to imperfections in the calibration data (bottom
two spectra) or low-level fringing (3rd from the top). In other cases the sky subtraction is noise limited. We note that even for the worst
cases only a few dozen pixels across the entire spectrum are not noise limited.

and we do not consider their inclusion a mistake. Among
the nine others, four had wrong previous spectroscopic
redshifts (while the photometric redshifts were indeed
correct), presumably due to the poor quality of that pre-
viously available spectroscopic data. Four other galaxies,
with no pre-existing spectroscopic redshifts, had wrong
photometric redshifts: 3 of those were edge-on (dusty)
disks. One galaxy – a blend of two galaxies at diﬀerent
redshifts – had a wrong photometric redshift as well as a
wrong pre-existing spectroscopic redshift. We conclude
that our sample is aﬀected by wrong selection redshifts
at the 1% level.

The key measurements made from the spectra are the
stellar population age and metallicity, and the stellar/gas
velocity dispersion. Here we provide a brief overview
of the methodology, while a full description of the test-
ing and error budget are postponed until these measure-
ments are made publicly available (end of 2016).

The ﬁrst step is to ﬁt the full spectrum following
the method of Paciﬁci et al. (2012). Star formation-
and chemical enrichment histories from the De Lucia &
Blaizot (2007) galaxy formation model are used to gen-
erate a library of template spectra, where the evolving
chemical enrichment is calculated based upon the star
formation history. We estimate gas-phase metallicities
as well and CLOUDY (Ferland et al. 1998) is used to
calculate the contribution of nebular line and continuum
emission in a manner consistent with the radiation out-
put of the stars. We adopt the model of Charlot & Fall
(2000) to treat dust, where the light from old stars is
attenuated by a large-scale,diﬀuse component, and the
light from young stars is attenuated ﬁrst by a birth-cloud

component and then by the diﬀuse component.

Given the restframe spectrum from which the contin-
uum has been removed, likelihoods are computed for all
models, resulting in marginalized probability distribu-
tions for the model parameters. The quantities of inter-
est here are speciﬁc star formation rate, luminosity- and
mass-weighted age, gas-phase and stellar metallicity.

The ten best-ﬁtting model spectra from this full spec-
tral ﬁt of a given galaxy spectrum are used as templates
for the velocity dispersion measurement for that galaxy,
following the approach of Bezanson et al. (2015). Using
the pPXF code (Cappellari & Emsellem 2004), emission-
line subtracted galaxy and model spectra are continuum
ﬁltered by multiplicative and additive polynomials, after
which a Gaussian convolution of the model spectra in
real space is ﬁt to the galaxy spectrum. The gas-phase
velocity dispersion is estimated by ﬁtting the continuum
subtracted galaxy spectrum with the best-ﬁtting emis-
sion line model spectrum, convolved with a Gaussian.
We note that these kinematic quantities are integral mea-
surements from the light in the slits – no aperature cor-
rections are made at this point.

The resulting stellar velocity dispersion is then used
to smooth the model spectra used for the spectral ﬁt-
ting and the initial stellar population ﬁt is repeated to
verify that the initial results were not biased due to the
mismatch in spectral resolution.

3.5.1. Stellar Populations: Line Indices

Measurement and interpretation of stellar absorption
features in the optical range provide a well-tested and
alternative method to full spectral ﬁtting to derive con-

(cid:11)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:7)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:9)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:13)(cid:20)(cid:14)(cid:17)(cid:14)(cid:18)(cid:15)(cid:19)(cid:16)(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:21)(cid:3)van der Wel et al.

straints on stellar mass, ages and abundances. In partic-
ular we measure all the indices deﬁned in the Lick/IDS
system (Worthey et al. 1994; Worthey & Ottaviani 1997),
including the high-order Balmer lines, in the galaxy spec-
tra cleaned of emission lines (obtained by subtracting
the best-ﬁt emission line model spectrum as described
in Section 3.5). Following the approach outlined in Gal-
lazzi et al. (2005, 2014), we derive marginalized proba-
bility density functions for stellar mass, light- and mass-
weighted stellar ages and stellar metallicities by compar-
ing the observed strengths (accounting for velocity dis-
persion broadening) of optimal sets of absorption indices
(deﬁned on the basis of the galaxy redshift) to a library of
BC03-based models convolved with stochastic SFHs and
metallicities. Additionally, element abundance ratios are
estimated from the ratio of Mg and Fe features (Gallazzi
et al. 2006, e.g., Mgb/(cid:104)Fe(cid:105)) and from CN indices (e.g.,
Carretero et al. 2004).

3.6. Auxiliary Datasets

3.6.1. Photometry: Stellar Masses and Rest-frame Colors

Using the data from Muzzin et al. (2013a,b) and follow-
ing their methodology we use FAST (Kriek et al. 2008) to
ﬁt the photometric spectral energy distribution and mea-
sure stellar masses and rest-frame colors. Here, a tem-
plate library with solar-metallicity spectra from SFHs
with exponentially declining SFRs and dust-screen atten-
uation (Calzetti et al. 2000) is used. The improvements
with respect to the modeling results from Muzzin et al.
(2013b) stem solely from the use of our spectroscopic
redshifts.
In a second iteration we jointly ﬁt the pho-
tometry and spectroscopy, deriving stellar masses and
rest-frame colors with the methodology described above
in Section 3.5. We will provide both photometric and
photometric+spectroscopic stellar mass estimates.

3.6.2. Structural Parameters from HST imaging

ACS imaging is available for nearly all targets from
the COSMOS program (Scoville et al. 2007). 10(cid:48)(cid:48) image
cutouts are created with the IPAC tool and the 2-D light
proﬁles are ﬁt with single-S´ersic proﬁles using galfit
(Peng et al. 2010), with eﬀective radius, total magni-
tude, S´ersic index, axis ratio, and position angle, and
background as the free parameters. The Point Spread
Function is chosen from a list of stars in the COSMOS
ﬁeld based on closest proximity in terms of detector po-
sition. A user-created error image is calculated based
on the IPAC-provided weight image with added Poisson
noise from the objects. Neighbors are simultaneously ﬁt.
Uncertainties are assigned based on the total S/N and
values of the ﬁtting parameters, as described by van der
Wel et al. (2012).

4. FIRST LOOK RESULTS

An early milestone in the LEGA-C survey is to conﬁrm
that the data quality is as expected. In Figure 5 we show
the S/N distribution for the primary sample observed in
2014-2015, in comparison with the expected S/N that
we calculated in advance. For star-forming galaxies we
typically achieve S/N = 10 − 20˚A
and for quiescent
galaxies S/N = 20−30˚A
, both in line with the expected
values.

magnitude and galaxy size, calculated in preparation of the survey.
Blue crosses indicate star-forming galaxies, red crosses quiescent
galaxies. The general agreement implies that our predictions were
accurate and that the data quality is as expected, if not slightly
better. The scatter can be explained by variations in radial sur-
face brightness proﬁles, axis ratios, position angles, and observing
conditions.

The LEGA-C Survey

In Figure 6 we show for the primary sample observed
so far (23% of the total) the bi-modal distribution in
terms of stellar mass and star-formation rate (broad-
band photometry-based, from Muzzin et al. 2013b)18 The
dynamic range in these quantities is such that our sample
represents the full galaxy population with stellar masses
M∗ > 1010 M(cid:12), where the majority of stars form and
live throughout cosmic history (e.g., Karim et al. 2011).
An illustration of the application of new information
obtained through our deep spectroscopy is shown in Fig-
ure 6, where we color-code the objects by their stellar
velocity dispersion. Galaxies with higher stellar masses
have higher velocity dispersions, but also, at a ﬁxed stel-
lar mass quiscent galaxies have higher velocity disper-
sions than star-forming galaxies. This has been seen for
present-day galaxies (Wake et al. 2012) and has been
predicted for high-redshift galaxies (Franx et al. 2008).
Our evidence that star formation activity correlates with
dynamical structure implies that the diﬀerent size-mass
relations for star-forming and quiescent galaxies (e.g.,
Shen et al. 2003; van der Wel et al. 2014) provide im-
portant constraints on galaxy formation models, and do
not merely reﬂect diﬀerences in M/L gradients and not
result from practical problems with measuring sizes of
distant galaxies.

We note that the correlation between true velocity dis-
persion (meaning the dispersion in stellar velocities at
a ﬁxed location in a galaxy) and star-formation activ-
ity must be even stronger than is apparent in Figure 6:
much of our velocity dispersion estimates – simple, 2nd-
order velocity moments, measured from the integrated
light in the slit – presumably reﬂect rotation, especially
for star-forming disks.

A visual impression of the quality of the spectra, and
the range in galaxy properties in the same, is shown in
Figure 7. Ten spectra are sorted by the galaxies’ Sersic
index, a parameter that unlike stellar mass or color is
measured independently of spectral properties. Stellar
population characteristics are visually apparent for all
ten galaxies, regardless of their structural properties or
star formation activity. We see a clear change in spectral
properties as a function of structure, from passive/old for
high-Sersic index galaxies to young/star-forming for low-
Sersic index galaxies. We note that even the youngest
objects show clear absorption lines.

A further illustration is given in Figure 8, where we sort
ﬁve star-forming disk galaxies by their inclination angle.
Face-on and edge-on disks each present their own spe-
ciﬁc observational challenge for deep spectroscopy:
low
surface brightness and extinction, respectively. Yet, we
have achieved high-S/N continuum spectra for each of
the galaxies.

5. TIMELINE AND OUTLOOK

The LEGA-C observations will nominally conclude in
May 2018, modulo uncertain weather and other losses.
The ﬁrst data release is scheduled for June 1st, 2016.
This release will include reduced, calibrated, extracted

18 We note that the star-formation rate indicator is based on
UV and IR ﬂuxes. Therefore, any source of UV+IR radiation that
is not from star formation is still counted as such. For example,
dust heated by evolved stellar populations may signiﬁcantly aﬀect
the IR luminosity of massive early-type galaxies (e.g., Groves et al.
2012).

spectra for all 925 galaxies for which observations were
completed before June 2015. A basic catalog with Ul-
traVISTA IDs, coordinates, magnitudes, redshifts, and
S/N values will accompany this release.

A second release will follow by the end of 2016, which
will include spectra for all galaxies observed until May
2016, as well as the ﬁrst set of value-added catalogs with
redshifts, velocity dispersions, and emission/absorption
line strength indices. The third and fourth data releases
are scheduled for December 2017 and December 2018.
Besides the additional spectra and ﬁrst set of value-added
catalogs, these two releases will also include a second set
of value-added catalogs containing stellar masses, ages,
metallicities, structural parameters from HST imaging
and dynamical masses.

With the data in hand, we can, as a community, start
addressing scientiﬁc questions outlined in Section 2. The
data will be publicly released by June 1st 2016, and we do
not have to wait until the sample collection is complete to
achieve many science goals. The current dataset already
far surpasses any previously existing dataset.

a representative view of the galaxy, but in some cases a signiﬁcant amount of the light is missed due to the extent and/or orientation of
the galaxy (e.g., ID 131951).

The LEGA-C Survey

Figure 8. Five LEGA-C spectra of disk galaxies sorted by inclination (projected axis ratio b/a). See caption of Figure 7 for a detailed
description of the contents of this ﬁgure. A clear reddening is seen for more inclined galaxies, and despite signiﬁcant dust columns continuum
is with high S/N in all cases (e.g., ID 140059).
