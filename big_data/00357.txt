In this paper the duality correspondence between fermion-antifermion and difermion interaction
channels is established in two (2+1)-dimensional Gross-Neveu type models with a fermion number
chemical potential µ and a chiral chemical potential µ5. The role and inﬂuence of this property
on the phase structure of the models are investigated. In particular, it is shown that the chemical
potential µ5 promotes the appearance of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, whereas the chemical
potential µ contributes to the emergence of superconductivity.

INTRODUCTION

It is well known that relativistic quantum ﬁeld models with four-fermion (4F) interactions serve as eﬀective theories
for low energy considerations of diﬀerent real phenomena in a variety of physical branches. For example, the meson
spectroscopy, neutron star and heavy-ion collision physics are often investigated in the framework of (3+1)-dimensional
4F theories [1, 2], known as Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) models [3]. In particular, low dimensional 4F ﬁeld theories
provide a powerful tool for investigations in condensed-matter physics.
Indeed, physics of (quasi)one-dimensional
organic Peierls insulators (the best known material of this kind is polyacetylene) is well described in terms of the
(1+1)-dimensional 4F Gross-Neveu (GN) model [4–8]. The quasirelativistic treatment of electrons in planar systems
like high-temperature superconductors or in graphene (a planar monoatomic layer of carbon atoms) is also possible
in terms of (2+1)-dimensional GN models [9–15].

Notice that there are physical eﬀects, which were observed for the ﬁrst time just in the framework of NJL- and
GN-type models.
In particular, the phenomenon of a dynamical generation of a fermion mass is well-known for
strong interaction physics since the time, when Nambu and Jona-Lasinio [3] proved a dynamical breaking of the
continuous γ5-symmetry on the basis of a generic 4F interaction theory. Later on, this eﬀect served as the basis of a
qualitatively successful description of the low-energy meson spectrum of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) [1]. The
eﬀect of dynamical symmetry breaking and generation of a fermion mass is also known in low dimensional, D=1+1 and
D=2+1, GN theories [4, 16–18], where the four-fermion theory is renormalizable and asymptotic free [4] in the case of
D=1+1, whereas for D=2+1 the 4F GN models are perturbatively nonrenormalizable but become renormalizable in
the framework of the 1/N expansion technique [18] (N being the number of fermion ﬁelds). Another example of this
kind is the eﬀect of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking induced by external magnetic or chromomagnetic ﬁelds.
This eﬀect was for the ﬁrst time studied also in terms of the (2+1)-dimensional GN model [19].

Note in addition that due to a rather simple structure, diﬀerent low dimensional GN models provide a good
laboratory for a deeper study of dense baryon matter and, in particular, for the consideration of such phenomena as
(color)superconductivity [20, 21], charged pion condensation [22, 23], etc. Moreover, these theories are very useful in
developing new quantum ﬁeld theoretical techniques like the 1/N expansion [18], the optimized perturbation theory
[24, 25], and so on.

It is necessary to point out that there is one more, not yet mentioned above phenomenon, which is still a well-known
feature of only some (1+1)-dimensional 4F theories. This is the duality correspondence between chiral symmetry
breaking and superconductivity [26–29]. (In order to avoid the prohibition of Cooper pairing as well as spontaneous
breaking of a continuous symmetry in (1+1)-dimensional models [30], the consideration should be performed in the
leading order of the 1/N -technique, i.e.
in the large-N limit assumption. In this case quantum ﬂuctuations, which
would otherwise destroy a long-range order corresponding to spontaneous symmetry breaking, are suppressed by 1/N
factors.) To formulate this phenomenon, let us imagine that there is a microscopic 4F theory (for D=1+1 see, e.g.,
[20, 29]) which describes a competition between fermion-antifermion (or chiral) and difermion (or superconducting)
channels of interaction. Moreover, we suppose that the ground state of the model is characterized by nonzero fermion
number- and chiral charge densities (the last is an imbalance between densities of left- and right-handed fermions),
i.e. there are two external parameters, fermion number- µ and chiral charge- µ5 chemical potentials, correspondingly.
Then the duality phenomenon means that the phase structure of this 4F model is symmetric with respect to the
following simultaneous transformations G1 ↔ G2, µ ↔ µ5 and chiral symmetry breaking ↔ superconductivity (here
G1 and G2 are the coupling constants in the chiral and superconducting channels, respectively). Thus, there is a
correspondence between properties (phase structure) of the model, e.g., at G1 < G2 and G1 > G2, etc. Moreover,
knowing condensates and other dynamical and thermodynamical quantities of the system, e.g. in the chirally broken
phase, one can obtain the corresponding quantities in the superconducting phase of the model, by simply performing

2

there the duality transformation.

It is worth to note that in recent years properties of media with nonzero chiral chemical potential µ5, i.e. chiral
media, attracted considerable interest (see, e.g., [31, 32] and references therein). In nature, chiral media might be
realized in heavy-ion collisions, compact stars, condensed matter systems, etc.
[31] (see also the review [33]). Thus
it is important to predict/observe the duality between qualitatively diﬀerent phenomena accompanied by µ5 in ﬁeld
theories in spacetime dimensions D>1+1. In this paper we demonstrate that there exists a dual correspondence (or
dual symmetry) between chiral symmetry breaking phenomenon and superconductivity in the framework of some
(2+1)-dimensional 4F models. We hope that our investigations shed some new light on the physical eﬀects in planar
condensed matter systems.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Sec.II a (2+1)-dimensional 4F GN-type model, containing both fermion-
antifermion (or chiral) and difermion (or superconducting) interaction channels and including two kinds of chemical
potentials, µ, µ5, is presented. Here we show that under the Pauli-G¨ursey transformations of fermi ﬁelds there is
a dual relationship between the relevant 4F structures. Next, the unrenormalized thermodynamic potential (TDP)
of the GN-type model is given in the leading order of the large-N expansion. In Sec.III the dual symmetry of the
model TDP is established. It means that it is invariant under the interchange of coupling constants, µ, µ5 chemical
potentials and chiral and superconducting condensates. Moreover, the renormalization of the TDP is performed.
Sec.IV contains a detailed numerical investigation of various phase portraits with particular emphasis on the role of
the duality symmetry of the TDP. Some technical details are relegated to Appendices. Moreover, in Appendix B we
present an alternative (2+1)-dimensional GN model with dual relationship between other chiral and superconducting
channels of 4F interaction.

II. THE MODEL AND ITS THERMODYNAMIC POTENTIAL

Our investigation is based on a (2+1)-dimensional GN–type model with massless fermions belonging to a funda-
mental multiplet of the auxiliary O(N ) ﬂavor group. Its Lagrangian describes the interaction both in the fermion–
antifermion and difermion (or superconducting) channels:

In addition, µ and µ5 in (1) denote a fermion number chemical potential and a chiral (axial) chemical potential,
respectively. µ is conjugated to a fermion, or electric charge, number density n, whereas µ5 is conjugated to a
nonzero density of chiral charge n5 = nR − nL, which represents an imbalance in densities of the right- and left-
handed fermions. As it is noted above, all fermion ﬁelds ψk (k = 1, ..., N ) form a fundamental multiplet of the O(N )
group. Moreover, each ﬁeld ψk is a four-component (reducible) Dirac spinor (the symbol T denotes the transposition
operation). Therefore, in Eqs. (1)-(2) the quantities γν (ν = 0, 1, 2) and γ5 are matrices in the four-dimensional
spinor space. Moreover, C ≡ γ2 is the charge conjugation matrix. The algebra of these matrices as well as their
particular representations are given in Appendix A. Clearly, the Lagrangian L is invariant under transformations
from the internal auxiliary O(N ) group, which is introduced here in order to make it possible to perform all the
calculations in the framework of the nonperturbative large-N expansion method. Physically more interesting is that
the model (1) is invariant under transformations from the UV (1) × Uγ 5(1) group, where UV (1) is the fermion number
conservation group, ψk → exp(iα)ψk (k = 1, .., N ), and Uγ 5(1) is the group of continuous chiral transformations,
ψk → exp(iαγ5)ψk (k = 1, ..., N ). It means that in the framework of the model (1) both the particle number density
Before studying the thermodynamics of the model, we would like to point out that there is a so-called duality
correspondence between chiral and superconducting channels of the model (1)-(2). To see this, it is very useful to
form an inﬁnite set F composed of all Lagrangians L(G1, G2; µ, µ5) when the free model parameters G1, G2, µ and
µ5 take arbitrary admissible values, i.e. L(G1, G2; µ, µ5) ∈ F at arbitrary ﬁxed values of coupling constants G1 > 0,

¯ψkγ0ψk and the density of chiral charge n5 =PN

¯ψkγ0γ5ψk are conserved quantities. 1

1 Since for the reducible four-component spinor representation there is one more Hermitian matrix γ3, which anticommutes with γν
(ν = 0, 1, 2) and γ5, one can consider another continuous chiral Uγ3 (1) transformation group of the spinor ﬁelds, ψk → exp(iαγ3)ψk
(k = 1, ..., N ). Alternatively, there exists a 4F model with another fermion–antifermion and difermion channels of interaction, which, in
addition to UV (1), is invariant under the continuous chiral Uγ3 (1) group (see Appendix B). It is worth mentioning that in the case of
graphene reducible four-component spinors just describe the two sublattice (or pseudospin) and two valley (or Dirac point) degrees of
freedom of the hexagonal honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms (see e.g. [15] and references therein).

G2 > 0 and chemical potentials µ, µ5. Then, let us perform in (1)-(2) the so-called Pauli-G¨ursey (PG) transformation
of spinor ﬁelds [34],

(1 + γ5)C ¯ψT

k (x).

(3)

Taking into account that all spinor ﬁelds anticommute with each other, it is easy to see that under the action of the
transformations (3) the 4F structures of the Lagrangian (1) are converted into themselves, i.e.

(4F )ch

P G←→ (4F )sc,

(4)

and, moreover, each element (Lagrangian) L(G1, G2; µ, µ5) of the set F is transformed into another element of the
set F according to the following rule

L(G1, G2; µ, µ5) P G←→ L(G2, G1;−µ5,−µ) ∈ F ,

(5)

i.e. the set F is invariant under the ﬁeld transformations (3). Owing to the relations (4) and (5) there is a connection
between properties of the model at some ﬁxed free model parameters G1, G2, µ, µ5 and properties of the model in
the case, when G1 ↔ G2 and µ ↔ µ5. In partiqular, if at some ﬁxed G1, G2, µ and µ5 we have the chiral symmetry
breaking (CSB) phase, then at G1 ↔ G2 and µ ↔ µ5 one can deﬁnitely predict the superconducting (SC) phase, and
vice versa. Due to this reason, we will call the relations (4) and (5) the duality property of the model (or duality
correspondence between CSB and SC). Note also that in Appendix B we present another (2+1)-dimensional 4F model,
in which the duality correspondence between alternative chiral and superconducting channels is realized.

Further on, we will study the role and the inﬂuence of the duality property of the model (1) on its phase structure. To
this end, we introduce the semi-bosonized version of Lagrangian (1) that contains only quadratic powers of fermionic
ﬁelds as well as auxiliary bosonic ﬁelds σ(x), π(x), ∆(x) and ∆∗(x),

(Here and in what follows the summations over repeated indices k = 1, ..., N and ν = 0, 1, 2 are implied.) Clearly, the
Lagrangians (1) and (6) are equivalent, as can be seen by using the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for bosonic

One can easily see from (7) that the neutral ﬁelds σ(x) and π(x) are real quantities, i.e.
(π(x))† = π(x) (the superscript symbol † denotes the Hermitian conjugation), but the (charged) difermion ﬁelds ∆(x)
and ∆∗(x) are Hermitian conjugated complex quantities, so that (∆(x))† = ∆∗(x) and vice versa. Moreover, under
the chiral Uγ 5(1) group the ﬁelds ∆(x), ∆∗(x) are singlets, but the ﬁelds σ(x), π(x) are transformed in the following

(8)

Clearly, all the ﬁelds (7) are also singlets with respect to the auxiliary O(N ) group, since the representations of this
group are real. Moreover, with respect to the parity transformation P ,

k = 1, ..., N,

(9)

the ﬁelds σ(x), ∆(x) and ∆∗(x) are even quantities, i.e. scalars, but π(x) is a pseudoscalar. If the difermion ﬁeld
∆(x) has a nonzero ground state expectation value, i.e. h∆(x)i 6= 0, then the Abelian fermion number conservation
UV (1) symmetry of the model is spontaneously broken down and the superconducting phase is realized in the model.
However, if hσ(x)i 6= 0 then the continuous Uγ 5(1) chiral symmetry of the model is spontaneously broken.

(12)

For simplicity, throughout the paper we suppose that the above mentioned ground state expectation values do not
depend on spacetime coordinates, i.e.

hσ(x)i ≡ M,

hπ(x)i ≡ π,h∆(x)i ≡ ∆,

h∆∗(x)i ≡ ∆∗,

(13)

where M, π, ∆, ∆∗ are constant quantities. In fact, they are coordinates of the global minimum point of the thermo-
dynamic potential (TDP) Ω(M, π, ∆, ∆∗). In the leading order of the large-N expansion and using (13) it is deﬁned
by the following expression:

The TDP (14) is invariant with respect to chiral Uγ 5(1) symmetry group. So, as it is clear from (8), it depends on the
quantities M and π through the combination M 2 + π2. Moreover, without loss of generality, one can suppose that
hπ(x)i ≡ π = 0. Thus, to ﬁnd the other ground state expectation values hσ(x)i etc., it is enough to study the global
minimum point of the TDP Ω(M, ∆, ∆∗),

quantities ∆, ∆∗ might be considered as real ones. 2 So, in what follows we will suppose that ∆ = ∆∗ ≡ ∆, where ∆
now is already a real quantity.

III. CALCULATION OF THE TDP

The path integration in the expression (16) is evaluated in Appendix C 3, so we have for the TDP (16) the following

(17) describes thermodynamics of the model at zero temperature. Taking into account the expressions (C8), the TDP

(19)

It is clear from (19) that the TDP (18) is an even function of each of the quantities µ, µ5, M , and ∆, i.e. without
loss of generality we can consider in the following only µ ≥ 0, µ5 ≥ 0, M ≥ 0, and ∆ ≥ 0 values of these quantities.
Moreover, the TDP (18) is invariant with respect to the so-called duality transformation [28, 29],

D :

G1 ←→ G2, M ←→ ∆, µ ←→ µ5.

(20)

Notice that this invariance of the TDP is a consequence of the rule (5), according to which the 4F Lagrangian (1) is
modiﬁed under the Pauli-Gursey transformation (3) of the spinor ﬁeld.

In powers of ∆ the fourth-degree polynomial Pη(p0) has the following form

Pη(p0) ≡ ∆4 − 2∆2(p2

Expanding the right-hand side of (21) in powers of M , one can obtain an equivalent alternative expression for this
polynomial. Namely,

Pη(p0) ≡ M 4 − 2M 2(p2

Note also that according to the general theorem of algebra, the polynomial Pη(p0) can be presented in the form

A. Renormalization of the TDP in the vacuum case: µ = 0, µ5 = 0

First of all, let us obtain a ﬁnite, i.e. renormalized, expression for the TDP (27) at µ = 0 and µ5 = 0, i.e.

in
vacuum. Since in this case a thermodynamic potential is usually called eﬀective potential, we use for it the notation
V un(M, ∆). It follows from (18) and (19) that at µ = 0 and µ5 = 0 V un(M, ∆) looks like

(28)

where E± =p|~p|2 + (M ± ∆)2. (To obtain the second line of this formula, we have integrated there over p0 according

to the relation (26).) It is evident that the eﬀective potential (28) is an ultraviolet divergent quantity. So, we need

to renormalize it. This procedure consists of two steps: (i) First of all we need to regularize the divergent integral in
(28), i.e. we suppose there that |p1| < Λ, |p2| < Λ. (ii) Second, we must suppose also that the bare coupling constants
G1 and G2 depend on the cutoﬀ parameter Λ in such a way that in the limit Λ → ∞ one obtains a ﬁnite expression
for the eﬀective potential.
Before performing the steps (i) and (ii) of the renormalization procedure, it is useful to take into account the

following asymptotic expansion at |~p| → ∞

(29)

Then, after construction of the regularized eﬀective potential V reg(M, ∆) (see below), we use there the asymptotic
expansion (29) and integrate it over p1 and p2 term-by-term. The result reads

where O(Λ0) denotes an expression which is ﬁnite in the limit Λ → ∞. Now, we should suppose that the bare coupling
constants G1 and G2 depend on the cutoﬀ parameter Λ in such a way that in the limit Λ → ∞ one obtains a ﬁnite
expressions in the square brackets of (30). Clearly, to fulﬁl this requirement it is suﬃcient to require that

where g1,2 are ﬁnite and Λ-independent model parameters with dimensionality of inverse mass. Since bare couplings
G1 and G2 do not depend on a normalization point, the same property is also valid for g1,2. Hence, taking into
account in (30) the relations (31) and ignoring there an inﬁnite M - and ∆-independent constant, one obtains the
following renormalized, i.e. ﬁnite, expression V ren(M, ∆) for the eﬀective potential,

V ren(M, ∆) = lim

It should also be mentioned that the eﬀective potential (32) is a renormalization group invariant quantity.

The fact that it is possible to renormalize the eﬀective potential of the initial model (1) in the leading order of
the large N -expansion is the reﬂection of a more general property of (2+1)-dimensional theories with four-fermion
interactions.
Indeed, it is well known that in the framework of the ”naive” perturbation theory (over coupling
constants) these models are not renormalizable. However, as it was proved in [18], in the framework of nonperturbative
large N -technique these models are renormalizable in each order of the 1/N -expansion.

The O(Λ0) term in (30) can be calculated explicitly, so we have for the renormalized eﬀective potential V ren(M, ∆)

B. Renormalization of the TDP (27) in the general case

To renormalize the TDP (27), it is necessary to imagine how the integrand of (27), i.e. the quantityPη=±P4
i=1 |pη
0i|,
behaves at asymptotically high values of |~p|. The properties of the roots pη
0i (i = 1, ..., 4) of the polynomial Pη(p0)
appearing in (18) can be obtained both numerically and analytically using the methods of Appendix B of [29]. So it
is easy to show that

(34)

Since the asymptotic expansions (34) and (29) coincide, one can substract from the integrand of (27) the expression
4(E+ + E−), thereby obtaining a convergent integral. Taking into account this circumstance, we have identically

Ωun(M, ∆) = V un(M, ∆) −eΩ(M, ∆),

(35)

where V un(M, ∆) is the eﬀective potential (28) of the model in vacuum, i.e. at µ = 0 and µ5 = 0, and

eΩ(M, ∆) =

It is clear that the term eΩ(M, ∆) in (35) is a convergent integral and all ultraviolet divergences of the TDP (27)-(35)

are located in the term V un(M, ∆). Hence, we can renormalize only the ﬁrst term of (35) in the way of the previous
subsection and obtain ﬁnally:

Ωren(M, ∆) = V ren(M, ∆) −eΩ(M, ∆),
where V ren(M, ∆) and eΩ(M, ∆) are presented in (33) and (36), correspondingly.

It was already mentioned above that using the method presented in Appendix B of the paper [29], the roots pη
0i
can be calculated numerically (at ﬁxed values of |~p|2, M, ∆, etc). As a result, it is also possible to study numerically
the whole TDP (37). Carrying out this procedure, we have seen that the global minimum of the TDP Ωren(M, ∆) is
always at the point of the form (M ≥ 0, ∆ = 0) or (M = 0, ∆ ≥ 0). So, to get a more detailed information about the
phase structure of the model, it is suﬃcient to investigate the reductions of the TDP (37) on the M - and ∆ axes 4 ,
i.e. to consider the functions

potential (33) on the M (in this case i = 1, x = M ) or ∆ (in this case i = 2, x = ∆) axes. Moreover, to obtain
the second line in (38) we use the evident relations, |x| = xθ(x) − xθ(−x) and 1 = θ(x) + θ(−x). After tedious but
straightforward calculations, the TDP (38) can be presented in the following form (see Appendix D):

(at µ5 = 0 this expression coincides with the corresponding TDP (22) from the paper [12]). Moreover, comparing
the expressions (38) and (39), we see that the quantity Ωren(M = 0, ∆) can be easily obtained from the TDP
Ωren(M, ∆ = 0) by the substitutions M → ∆, g1 → g2 and µ ↔ µ5, i.e.

.

(41)

Clearly, the connection (41) between the reductions of the TDP Ωren(M, ∆) on the M - and ∆ axes is the consequence
of the duality property (20) of the model.

Next, in order to ﬁnd the phase structure of the model, we will determine the global minimum points of the
TDPs F1(M ) (40) and F2(∆) (41) and then compare the minimum values of these functions vs external parameters
µ, µ5, g1, g2.

4 This procedure can be easily performed since the reduction of the roots pη

0i on the M - and ∆ axes is known (see (24) and (25)).

IV. PHASE STRUCTURE: THE ROLE OF THE DUALITY INVARIANCE OF THE TDP

Suppose now that at some ﬁxed particular values of the model parameters, i.e. at g1 = A, g2 = B and µ = α, µ5 = β,
the global minimum of the TDP (37) lies at the point, e.g., (M = M0, ∆ = 0). It means that for such ﬁxed values
of the parameters the chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) phase is realized. Then it follows from the duality invariance
of the unrenormalized TDP with respect to the transformation D (20) that the permutation of the coupling constant
and chemical potential values 5 (i.e. at g1 = B, g2 = A and µ = β, µ5 = α) moves the global minimum of the TDP
Ωren(M, ∆) to the point (M = 0, ∆ = M0), and the superconducting (SC) phase is originated (and vice versa). This is
the so-called duality correspondence between CSB and SC phases in the framework of the model under consideration.
Hence, the knowledge of a phase of the model (1) at some ﬁxed values of external free model parameters g1, g2, µ, µ5
is suﬃcient to understand what phase is realized at rearranged values of external parameters, g1 ↔ g2, µ ↔ µ5.
Moreover, we would like to emphasize once again that there exists an equality of the order parameters (condensates),
which characterizes both the initial phase and the phase corresponding to rearranged external parameters. In other
words the chiral condensate of the CSB phase at ﬁxed g1, g2, µ, µ5 is equal to the SC condensate of the phase at
g1 ↔ g2, µ ↔ µ5 (and vice versa).
The duality transformation (20) of the TDP can also be applied to the arbitrary phase portrait of the model (see
below).
In particular, it is clear that if we have a most general phase portrait, i.e. the correspondence between
any point (g1, g2, µ, µ5) of the four-dimensional space of external parameters and possible model phases (CSB, SC
and symmetric phase), then under the duality transformation (g1 ↔ g2, µ ↔ µ5, CSB↔SC) this phase portrait is
mapped to itself, i.e. the most general phase portrait is selfdual. In practice, usually, there are constraints on the
model parameters. As a result, if the constraint is dually (non)invariant, then the phase portrait is also a dually
(non)invariant.

Below, we will use the dual symmetry of the TDP in order to explain and construct the phase structure of the

model in diﬀerent particular cases.

First of all, taking into account the duality correspondence between CSB and SC, let us determine its characteristic
features and then ﬁnd (analytically and numerically) the phase structure of the model (1) in two particular cases,

A. Selfdual phase portraits

5 It is evident that the duality transformation D for the renormalized TDP (37) means g1 ←→ g2, M ←→ ∆, µ ←→ µ5, under which this

TDP is invariant.

FIG. 3. The (µ, µ5)-phase portrait of the model at ﬁxed
coupling constants, such that g1 = g2 ≡ g > 0. The
notations I, II and III are the same as in Fig. 1.

FIG. 4. The (µ, µ5)-phase portrait of the model at ﬁxed
coupling constants, such that g1 = g2 ≡ g < 0. The
notations I, II and III are the same as in Fig. 1. The
letter T denotes a triple point.

(i) µ = µ5 and (ii) g1 = g2. It is evident that both of these constraints, (i) and (ii), are invariant with respect to
the duality transformation g1 ↔ g2, µ ↔ µ5. Hence, the corresponding phase portraits should be selfdual (a more
detailed explanation of this fact is presented in the next subsection). In the case (i) we want to study the (g1, g2)
phase portrait, whereas in the case (ii) – the (µ, µ5) phase portrait. It follows from the duality correspondence that
in the case (i) the region of the CSB phase is a mirror image of the SC phase with respect to the line g1 = g2 of the
(g1, g2) plane. However, in the case (ii) the regions of these phases are arranged mirror symmetrically with respect to
the line µ = µ5 of the plane (µ, µ5).

Of course, the speciﬁc form of the CSB and SC areas depends on the values of the external parameters. For
example, at µ = µ5 = 0 the phase structure is presented in Fig. 1. (Note that in order to obtain this phase portrait
it is suﬃcient to investigate the behavior of the global minimum point of the TDP V ren(M, ∆) (33) vs the coupling
constants g1 and g2.) However, at ﬁxed µ = µ5 > 0 the phase structure is presented in Fig. 2, where one can see the
mirror symmetrical arrangement of the phases II and III with respect to the line g1 = g2.

In Figs 3, 4 the (µ, µ5)-phase portraits of the model (1) are presented at ﬁxed g1 = g2 ≡ g > 0 and ﬁxed
g1 = g2 ≡ g < 0, respectively. The CSB and SC phases in these ﬁgures are arranged, as deﬁned above, symmetrically
with respect to the line µ = µ5 of the (µ, µ5) plane. If g > 0, then at the points of the boundary of the phase I in
Fig. 3, the second order phase transition takes place. In this case it is possible to give exact analytical expressions
for the boundaries of the region I in Fig. 3. Indeed, the global minimum point M0 of the TDP (40) is deﬁned by the
equation ∂F1(M )/∂M ≡ M f (M ) = 0. Inside the region II of Fig. 3 we have M0 > 0 and f (M0) = 0. However, on
the boundary between phases I and II one can see that M0 = 0 and, moreover, that f (0) = 0. It is the last relation
that deﬁnes the boundary equation between I and II phases. This equation looks like

µ = µ5 exp(cid:18)−

1

gµ5 − 1(cid:19) .

In a similar way it is possible to ﬁnd the equation for the boundary between I and III phases of Fig. 3:

µ5 = µ exp(cid:18)−

1

gµ − 1(cid:19) .

(42)

(43)

In contrast, on the boundary of the phase I of Fig. 4, a phase transition of the ﬁrst order takes place. Since on the
boundary between II and III phases of this ﬁgure we also have a ﬁrst order phase transitions, it is clear that the point
T of the phase portrait Fig. 4 is a so-called triple point, i.e. the point where three diﬀerent phases, I, II and III,
coexist. The triple point T of Fig. 4 corresponds to the chemical potential values µT = µ5T ≈ 1.2/|g|.

trary ﬁxed nonzero value µ5 and at µ = 0. The notations

B. Nonselfdual phase portraits and their dual transformations

1. The cases µ5 = 0, µ 6= 0 and µ = 0, µ5 6= 0

In these two particular cases the restrictions on the external model parameters are already not dually invariant, so
the corresponding (g1, g2)-phase portraits are not selfdual. However, as we shall see, each of these two phase portraits
is a dual mapping of another one.

The (g1, g2)-phase structure of the model at arbitrary ﬁxed nonzero value of µ (of µ5) and at µ5 = 0 (at µ = 0) is
presented in Fig. 5 (in Fig. 6). Let us ﬁrst compare Fig. 1 and Fig. 5. It is easy to see that if g1 > 0, g2 > 0 and
µ = µ5 = 0, then the system is in the symmetric phase I (see Fig. 1). However, an arbitrary small nonzero value of
the chemical potential µ induces (at µ5 = 0) in this case the superconducting phase III (see Fig. 5 as well as Fig. 3
for the particular case g1 = g2 > 0). Now suppose that coupling constants are arbitrary nonzero ﬁxed quantities, i.e.
g1 6= 0 and g2 6= 0. (In particular, the point (g1, g2) might belong to the phase II of Fig. 1, where chiral symmetry
is spontaneously broken at µ = 0, µ5 = 0.) Then it follows from Fig. 5 that at µ5 = 0 there is a suﬃciently high
critical value µc ≥ 0 of the chemical potential µ, such that at µ > µc the point (µg1, µg2) will certainly be in one of
the regions III of Fig. 5. Hence, the growth (at µ5 = 0) of the chemical potential µ leads to the appearance of the
SC phase in the model (1) at arbitrary g1 6= 0 and g2 6= 0. 6 Analysing in the same manner Fig. 6, we see that
in the opposite case when µ = 0 but µ5 > 0, the growth (at µ = 0) of the chiral chemical potential µ5 leads to the
appearance of the CSB phase in the model (1) at arbitrary ﬁxed g1 6= 0 and g2 6= 0.
Indeed, these two properties of the model (1), i.e. (A) the appearance of the SC at µ5 = 0 and at growing values
of µ as well as (B) the appearance of the CSB at µ = 0 and at growing values of µ5 (in these two cases it is supposed
that g1 6= 0 and g2 6= 0 are ﬁxed), are dually connected (or dually conjugated). To understand this fact, it is necessary
to emphasize once again that (A) follows from the phase portrait of Fig. 5, whereas (B) is the consequence of the
phase portrait presented in Fig. 6. Now we will demonstrate that under the dual transformation D (g1 ↔ g2, µ ↔ µ5,
CSB↔SC) the phase portrait of Fig. 5 is transformed into the phase portrait of Fig. 6 (and vice versa).
Note that the application of D to Fig. 5 can be divided into three more simple steps. (i) First, under permutation
M ↔ ∆ in (20) we have renaming of the phases, i.e. II↔III. (For example, in this case the global minimum point
of the CSB phase, i.e. the point (M0, 0), is transformed into the point (0, M0) and, as a result, the CSB phase is
transformed into the SC phase.) (ii) Second, performing the µ ↔ µ5 and g1 ↔ g2 transformations in Fig. 5, we
rename the coordinate axes of the ﬁgure (after the duality transformation we have along the vertical axis the quantity
µ5g1 and along the horizontal one the quantity µ5g2) and change its caption or external conditions, at which the
phase portrait is obtained. (In our case the caption µ5 = 0 with µ being an arbitrary ﬁxed quantity for Fig. 5 is

6 This was the main result of the paper [12], where the competition between CSB and SC was studied in the (2+1)-dimensional 4F model

at µ 6= 0, µ5 = 0 without duality correspondence.

replaced by µ = 0 with µ5 being an arbitrary ﬁxed quantity, i.e. we obtain the caption for Fig. 6.) (iii) Finally,
it is necessary to direct the axis corresponding to the quantity µ5g1 (to the quantity µ5g2) horizontally (vertically).
As a result of this dual transformation of the Fig. 5 we obtain just Fig. 6.

In a similar way it is possible to apply the duality transformation D to each of the phase portraits presented in
Figs. 1–4. As a result, we see that these phase structures are selfdual. In the next subsubsections we obtain the
phase structure of the model in other more general nonselfdual cases, i.e. the (g1, g2)-phase portraits at arbitrary
ﬁxed values of chemical potentials and the (µ, µ5)-phase portraits at arbitrary ﬁxed values of the coupling constants.

2. The (g1, g2)-phase structure at some nontrivial values of µ and µ5

Let us now ﬁx the fermion number chemical potential µ 6= 0 and consider how the (g1, g2)-phase portrait of the
model is evolved vs the chiral chemical potential µ5. This phase portrait at µ5 = 0 is presented in Fig. 5. In Figs. 7
we have drawn several (g1, g2)-phase portraits at diﬀerent relations between µ5 and µ, (a) µ5 = 0.2µ, (b) µ5 = 0.7µ,
(c) µ5 = 1.5µ, (d) µ5 = 2.5µ. Analyzing Figs. 5 and 7, we see the following phase evolution of the system vs µ5
at ﬁxed µ 6= 0. At µ5 = 0 the SC phase III ﬁlls almost the whole (µg1, µg2) plane (see Fig. 5). It means that at
arbitrary ﬁxed g1 6= 0 and g2 6= 0 we have superconductivity in the system at suﬃciently high values of µ (see Section

IV B 1). If µ5 begins to grow, then for a lot of (g1, g2) points there might occur a restoration of the initial symmetry
(the symmetrical phase I arises) in the model. However, the further growth of µ5 leads to the ﬁnal appearance of
the CSB phase. It is the general property of the chiral chemical potential µ5, which promotes the chiral symmetry
breaking in the system.

Since the above mentioned constraints (a),..,(d) at which Figs. 7 were drawn are not invariant under the duality
transformation D (20), we would like to note that the phase portraits of Fig. 7 are not selfdual. In this case the
possible duality transformation (see the previous subsubsection IV B 1) of Figs. 7 might result in the set of four phase
portraits, which are a good illustration of the evolution of the model phase structure vs the particle number chemical
potential µ at arbitrary ﬁxed µ5 6= 0. It is straightforwardly clear from the dual mapping of Figs. 7 that at arbitrary
ﬁxed values of µ5 > 0 and g1 6= 0, g2 6= 0 we have in the system the appearance of superconductivity at suﬃciently
high µ. This property is dually conjugated to the appearing of CSB phase at suﬃciently high values of µ5, which is
a consequence of the phase portraits Fig. 7 (see the above consideration).

3. The (µ, µ5)-phase structure at some nontrivial relations between g1 and g2

We have already considered the (µ, µ5)-phase structure of the model in the case of dually symmetrical constraints
on the coupling constants, i.e. when g1 = g2 (see Figs. 3, 4). In the present Section, special attention is paid to a
more general case when g1 6= g2. Here we construct (µ, µ5)-phase portraits of the model for qualitatively diﬀerent
representative relations between g1 and g2. Namely, we ﬁx in each of the regions of Fig. 1 some representative (g1, g2)
point and draw a corresponding (µ, µ5)-phase diagram. (Note that due to a duality symmetry of the model, it is
suﬃcient to reduce the number of the representative (g1, g2) points to three.)

In Fig. 8 the (µ, µ5)-phase portrait corresponds to arbitrary ﬁxed g1 > 0 and g2 = 0.2g1 (it is clear that at
µ = µ5 = 0 the point (g1, g2 = 0.2g1) lies in the symmetrical region I of Fig. 1). On the phase boundaries of this
ﬁgure there are phase transitions of the second order. In Fig. 9 the (µ, µ5)-phase portrait corresponds to arbitrary
ﬁxed g1 < 0 and g2 = −2g1 (in this case at µ = µ5 = 0 the point (g1, g2 = −2g1) lies in the CSB region II of Fig.
1). Finally, in Fig. 10 the (µ, µ5)-phase portrait corresponds to arbitrary ﬁxed g1 < 0 and g2 = 0.5g1 (in this case at
µ = µ5 = 0 the point (g1, g2 = 0.5g1) lies in the SC region III of Fig. 1). To obtain the (µ, µ5)-phase portraits of the
model when the point (g1, g2) is ﬁxed in the two remaining areas of Fig. 1, it is enough to perform the dual mapping
of the Figs 9 and 10.

In Figs. 9, 10 all phase boundaries are the curves of the ﬁrst order phase transitions, so the point T on these ﬁgures
is a triple point, where three phases coexist. The main conclusion from Figs 8-10 is that the growth of µ5 (the growth
of µ) induces the chiral symmetry breaking (induces the superconductivity).

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, the duality correspondence between CSB and SC, which was found earlier in (1+1)-dimensional 4F
is demonstrated to take place also in the framework of the (2+1)-dimensional 4F model (1). (An

alternative 4F model with other dually conjugated chiral and superconducting channels of interaction is considered
in Appendix B). It contains both fermion-antifermion (with G1 a bare coupling constant) and difermion (with G2 a
bare coupling constant) interaction channels and two kinds of chemical potentials, µ, µ5. The duality property of the
model means that its thermodynamic potential Ω(M, ∆) (17) is invariant under the duality transformation (20). As a
result, we have established the duality correspondence between CSB and SC phases of the model (1) (as well as of the
alternative model of Appendix B). Let us suppose, e.g., that for some ﬁxed set (g1, g2, µ, µ5) of external parameters
(the coupling constants g1 and g2 are connected with bare couplings G1,2 by the relation (31)) the chiral symmetry
breaking phase is realized in the model. Then for rearranged values of external parameters, g1 ↔ g2, µ ↔ µ5, (or for
dually conjugated set (g2, g1, µ5, µ)) we have the so-called dually conjugated superconducting phase (and vice versa).
Moreover, it must be emphasized that the chiral condensate of the CSB phase, realized for the set (g1, g2, µ, µ5), is
equal to the superconducting condensate of the dually conjugated SC phase, corresponding to the set of external
parameters with g1 ↔ g2, µ ↔ µ5 (and vice versa). In this way, it is suﬃcient to have the information about the
ground state of the initial phase, which is realized for the set (g1, g2, µ, µ5), in order to determine the properties of the
ground state of the dually conjugated phase, corresponding to the rearranged external parameter set (g2, g1, µ5, µ).

In order to study the role and inﬂuence of the duality property on the phase structure of the model, for comparison
and illustrations, we have demonstrated a variety of phase portraits in the (µ, µ5)- and (g1, g2) planes. In particular,
if the constraint, under which we obtain a phase portrait, is dually invariant, i.e. at µ = µ5 or at g1 = g2, then
we have a selfdual phase diagram (see, e.g., Figs 1–4). The selfdual phase portrait is mapped into itself under the
duality transformation (it is introduced in Sec. IV B 1) , and its most characteristic feature is the mirror symmetrical
arrangement of the CSB and SC phases with respect to the line µ = µ5 (or g1 = g2) of the phase diagram.

We have also presented a series of nonselfdual phase portraits, which do not transform into themselves under
the duality mapping (see Figs. 5–10). The results obtained lead to the conclusion that the growth of the chiral
chemical potential µ5 promotes the chiral symmetry breaking, 7 whereas particle number chemical potential µ induces
superconductivity in the system (see also in [12]).

We hope that our investigations may shed some new light on physical eﬀects in planar systems like high-temperature

superconductors or graphene.

7 In the recent paper [32] the properties of the simplest NJL model under the inﬂuence of µ5 was studied. It was shown there that the

chiral chemical potential plays a role of the catalyst of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.

Appendix A: Algebra of the γ matrices in the case of SO(2,1) group

The two-dimensional irreducible representation of the (2+1)-dimensional Lorentz group SO(2,1) is realized by the

14

following 2 × 2 ˜γ-matrices:

˜γ0 = σ3 =(cid:18) 1 0

0 −1(cid:19) , ˜γ1 = iσ1 =(cid:18) 0 i

−1 0(cid:19) ,
i 0(cid:19) , ˜γ2 = iσ2 =(cid:18) 0 1

acting on two-component Dirac spinors. They have the properties:

T r(˜γµ˜γν) = 2gµν;

[˜γµ, ˜γν] = −2iεµνα˜γα; ˜γµ˜γν = −iεµνα˜γα + gµν ,

where gµν = gµν = diag(1,−1,−1), ˜γα = gαβ ˜γβ, ε012 = 1. There is also the relation:

T r(˜γµ˜γν ˜γα) = −2iεµνα.

(A1)

(A2)

(A3)

Note that the deﬁnition of chiral symmetry is slightly unusual in (2+1)-dimensions (spin is here a pseudoscalar rather
than a (axial) vector). The formal reason is simply that there exists no other 2 × 2 matrix anticommuting with the
Dirac matrices ˜γν which would allow the introduction of a γ5-matrix in the irreducible representation. The important
concept of ’chiral’ symmetries and their breakdown by mass terms can nevertheless be realized also in the framework
of (2+1)-dimensional quantum ﬁeld theories by considering a four-component reducible representation for Dirac ﬁelds.
In this case the Dirac spinors ψ have the following form:

ψ(x) =(cid:18) ˜ψ1(x)
˜ψ2(x)(cid:19) ,

(A4)

with ˜ψ1, ˜ψ2 being two-component spinors. In the reducible four-dimensional spinor representation one deals with 4×4
γ-matrices: γµ = diag(˜γµ,−˜γµ), where ˜γµ are given in (A1). One can easily show, that (µ, ν = 0, 1, 2):

T r(γµγν) = 4gµν; γµγν = σµν + gµν;

σµν =

1
2

[γµ, γν] = diag(−iεµνα˜γα,−iεµνα˜γα).

(A5)

In addition to the Dirac matrices γµ (µ = 0, 1, 2) there exist two other matrices, γ3 and γ5, which anticommute with
all γµ (µ = 0, 1, 2) and with themselves

γ3 = i(cid:18) 0 , −I

I , 0(cid:19) ,
I , 0 (cid:19) , γ5 =(cid:18) 0 , I

(A6)

with I being the unit 2 × 2 matrix. It is obvious that γ3 = γ0γ1γ2γ5 and γ5 = −γ0γ1γ2γ3.

Appendix B: Alternative 4F (2+1)-dimensional model with dual symmetry between other CSB and SC

channels

Each of the matrices γ3 and γ5 (see Appendix A) can be selected as a generator for the corresponding Uγ 3(1) and
Uγ 5(1) chiral group of spinor ﬁeld transformations. For example, the Lagrangian (1) is invariant with respect to Uγ 5(1)
such that ψk(x) → exp(iαγ5)ψk(x). Alternatively, it is possible to construct a 4F model with fermion-antifermion
and superconducting channels, symmetric under Uγ 3(1) continuous chiral transformations, ψk(x) → exp(iαγ3)ψk(x)
(k = 1, .., N ). Its Lagrangian, e.g., reads

The relations (B4) are the basis for the duality invariance of the thermodynamic potential of the model (B1).

To verify this, one can use the way of Sec. II. Indeed, the semi-bosonized version of Lagrangian (B1) that contains
only quadratic powers of fermionic ﬁelds and auxiliary bosonic ﬁelds σ(x), ˜π(x), ˜∆(x) and ˜∆∗(x) has the following
form

(in (B5) and below the summation over k = 1, ..., N is implied). On Euler-Lagrange equations for bosonic ﬁelds,

the semi-bosonized Lagrangian (B5) is equivalent to the 4F Lagrangian (B1). Note also that the bosonic ﬁelds ˜∆(x)
and ˜∆∗(x) are pseudoscalars, whereas σ(x) and ˜π(x) are scalars with respect to parity transformation (9).

Then, the thermodynamic potential Ωγ 3(M, ∆), which describes the ground state of the model (B1)-(B5), is anal-

ogously deﬁned by the following relation (for convenience, we omit here and below the tilde in ﬁelds)

used in the derivation of the thermodynamic potential in the framework of the model (1) (see the derivation of (16)

model (1), we see that

Ωγ 3(M, ∆) = Ω(M, ∆)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)µ5→µ3

.

(B9)

As a result, it is clear that the TDP Ωγ 3(M, ∆) of the 4F model (B1) is invariant under the following dual transfor-
mation

Furthermore, to ﬁnd phase portraits of the model (B1), it is suﬃcient to perform in all Figs 1,..,10 the replacement
µ5 → µ3.

Appendix C: The path integration over anticommuting ﬁelds

where C is the charge conjugation matrix, C = γ2. Since in the 4×4 spinor space the product matrix CΓ should be
an antisymmetric one, it is clear that the Γ matrix in (C1) might be, e.g., the unit matrix 1s in the spinor space or
Γ = iγ3γ5 (for notations see Appendix A), etc. Note in addition that at Γ = 1s and DΓ = D (see in (16)) the integral
IΓ is equal to the argument of the ln-function in the formula (16) in the particular case N = 1, whereas at Γ = iγ3γ5
and DΓ = Dγ 3 (see (B7)) the integral IΓ is equal to the argument of the ln-function in the formula (B7) also in the
particular case N = 1. Recall, there are general Gaussian path integrals [35]:

should put A = ∆CΓ + DΓ(∆CΓ)−1DT

Γ and ¯η = 0. As a result, we have

We evaluate the expression (C5) in two cases, (i) when Γ = 1s and DΓ = D, where D is presented in (16), and (ii)
when Γ = iγ3γ5 and DΓ = Dγ 3, where Dγ 3 is given in (B7).

(A more detailed consideration of operator traces is presented in Appendix A of the paper [36].) In this formula the
symbol Tr means the trace of an operator both in the coordinate and internal spaces. Moreover, λi(p) (i = 1, ..., 4) in
(C7) are four eigenvalues of the 4×4 Fourier transformation matrix ¯B(p) of the operator B from (C6). Namely,

enough to take into account only nonnegative values of the chemical potentials µ and µ5.

Due to the presence of the θ(x)-functions in (D2) and suﬃciently high values of the cutoﬀ parameter Λ >> µ, µ5, M ,
the quantities I± indeed do not depend on Λ. Moreover, it is evident that I+ is a nonzero quantity only in the case

It is convenient to present the quantity I− from (D2) as a sum of two integrals, I− = i1 + i2, where
