ABSTRACT

Context. For the spectral analysis of high-resolution and high signal-to-noise (S/N) spectra of hot stars, state-of-the-art non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model atmospheres are mandatory. These are strongly dependent on the reliability of the atomic
data that is used for their calculation.
Aims. New Kr iv-vii oscillator strengths for a large number of lines enable us to construct more detailed model atoms for our NLTE
model-atmosphere calculations. This enables us to search for additional Kr lines in observed spectra and to improve Kr abundance
determinations.
Methods. We calculated Kr iv-vii oscillator strengths to consider radiative and collisional bound-bound transitions in detail in our
NLTE stellar-atmosphere models for the analysis of Kr lines that are exhibited in high-resolution and high S/N ultraviolet (UV)
observations of the hot white dwarf RE 0503−289.
Results. We reanalyzed the eﬀective temperature and surface gravity and determined Teﬀ = 70 000 ± 2000 K and log (g / cm s−2) =
7.5 ± 0.1. We newly identiﬁed ten Kr v lines and one Kr vi line in the spectrum of RE 0503−289. We measured a Kr abundance
of −3.3 ± 0.3 (logarithmic mass fraction). We discovered that the interstellar absorption toward RE 0503−289 has a multi-velocity
structure within a radial-velocity interval of −40 km s−1 < vrad < +18 km s−1.
Conclusions. Reliable measurements and calculations of atomic data are a prerequisite for state-of-the-art NLTE stellar-atmosphere
modeling. Observed Kr v-vii line proﬁles in the UV spectrum of the white dwarf RE 0503−289 were simultaneously well reproduced
with our newly calculated oscillator strengths.

Reliably determining the abundance of trans-iron elements
e.g., G191−B2B and
in hot white dwarf
RE 0503−289 (WD 0501+527 and WD 0501−289,
respec-
tively), McCook & Sion 1999a,b), recently became possible
with the calculation of transition probabilities for highly ion-
ized Zn (atomic number Z = 30), Ga (31), Ge (32), Mo (42),
and Ba (56) (Rauch et al. 2014a, 2015b, 2012, 2015a, 2014b).
These analyses were initiated by the discovery of lines of Ga,
Ge, As (33), Se (34), Kr (36), Mo, Sn (50), Te (52), I, (53), and
Xe (54) in the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)
spectrum of the hydrogen-deﬁcient DO-type WD RE 0503−289
by Werner et al. (2012b). Owing to the lack of atomic data at
that time, they could only measure the Kr and Xe abundances
(−4.3 ± 0.5 and −4.2 ± 0.6 in logarithmic mass fractions, respec-
tively). We calculated new Kr iv-vii transition probabilities to

local thermodynamical equilibrium (NLTE) model-atmosphere
calculations to improve the Kr abundance determination.

In Sects. 2 and 3, we brieﬂy describe the available observa-
tions, our model-atmosphere code, and the atomic data. Details
of the transition-probability calculations and a comparison of
the results with literature values are given in Sect. 4. Based on
our state-of-the-art NLTE models, we start our spectral analysis
with a veriﬁcation of the previous determination of the eﬀective
temperature and surface gravity by Dreizler & Werner (1996,
Teﬀ = 70 000 K, log (g / cm s−2) = 7.5) in Sect. 5. An improved
Kr abundance analysis for RE 0503−289 is then presented in
Sect. 6. The stellar mass and the distance of RE 0503−289 are
revisited in Sect. 7. At the end (Sect. 8), we take a look at the
velocity ﬁeld of the observed interstellar line absorption and
compare it with that of the nearby hydrogen-rich, DA-type WD
RE 0457−281 (WD 0455−282, mV = 13.90 McCook & Sion
1999a,b; Gianninas et al. 2011). We summarize and conclude
in Sect. 9.

2. Observations

We analyzed ultraviolet (UV) FUSE (described in detail by
Werner et al. 2012b) and HST/STIS (Hubble Space Telescope /
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph) observations (1144 Å <
λ < 3073 Å) of RE 0503−289, that were performed on 2014
08 14. The latter spectrum was co-added from two observa-
tions with grating E140M (exposure times 2493 s and 3001 s,
1144 Å − 1709 Å, resolving power R ≈ 45 800), and two ob-
servations with grating E230M (1338 s, 1690 Å − 2366 Å and
1338 s, 2277 Å − 3073 Å, R ≈ 30 000). These STIS observations
are retrievable from the Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space
Telescopes (MAST).

In addition to the UV observations, we used optical spectra
that were obtained at the European Southern Observatory (ESO)
and the Calar Alto (CA) observatory. In the framework of the
Supernova Ia Progenitor Survey project (SPY, Napiwotzki et al.
2001, 2003), observations were performed on 2000 09 09 and
2001 04 08 with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph
(UVES) attached to the Very Large Telescope (VLT) located
at ESO. The co-added spectra cover the wavelength intervals
[3290 Å, 4524 Å], [4604 Å, 5609 Å], and [5673 Å, 6641 Å] with
a resolution of about 0.2 Å. Two spectra [4094 Å, 4994 Å] and
[5680 Å, 6776 Å] were taken with the Cassegrain TWIN Spec-
trograph that was attached to the 3.5 m telescope at the CA ob-
servatory. Their resolution is about 3 Å (the same spectra were
used by Dreizler & Werner 1996).

For RE 0457−281, we used FUSE spectra (ObsIds
P1041101000, P1041102000, and P1041103000 from 2000 02
03, 2000 02 04, and 2000 02 07, respectively, with a total ob-
servation time of 47 465 s) that were obtained with the medium-
resolution (MDRS) aperture. In addition, we used an IUE (In-
ternational Ultraviolet Explorer) spectrum ([1153 Å, 1947 Å])
that was co-added from four observations that were obtained
in high-resolution (R ≈ 10 000) mode with the large aperture
(Data Ids SWP46302, SWP56213, SWP56262, and SWP56267
from 1992-11-19, 1995-11-18, 1995-12-02, and 1995-12-04, re-
spectively, with a total exposure time of 168 360 s, Holberg et al.
1998). This is available via the MAST High-Level Science Prod-
ucts.

3. Model atmospheres and atomic data

We calculated plane-parallel, chemically homogeneous model-
atmospheres in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium with
our Tübingen NLTE Model Atmosphere Package (TMAP1,
Werner et al. 2003, 2012a). Model atoms were provided by the
Tübingen Model Atom Database (TMAD2, Rauch & Deetjen
2003). TMAD was constructed as part of the Tübingen contribu-
tion to the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO3).
Our Kr model atom was designed with a statistical method
(similar to Rauch et al. 2015b) by calculating the so-called su-
per levels and super lines with our Iron Opacity and Interface
(IrOnIc4, Rauch & Deetjen 2003). Using our approach, we ne-
glected spin system and parity of the individual levels in the cal-
culation of the super levels. This is justiﬁed because, in the atmo-
sphere of RE 0503−289, the deviation of the levels’ occupation
numbers from LTE is small in the line-forming region of the at-
mosphere. The detailed ﬁts of our theoretical line proﬁles to the
observations (Sect. 6) do no give any hint of inconsistencies. To
process our new Kr data, we transferred it into Kurucz’s format5,
which is readable by IrOnIc. The statistics of our Kr model atom
are summarized in Table 1.

4. Oscillator-strength calculations in krypton ions

New oscillator strengths were computed for transitions in Kr iv-
vii ions in the present work. The method used was the same
as the one considered in our previous studies that focused on
Zn, Ga, Ge, Mo, and Ba ions (Rauch et al. 2014a, 2015b,

2012, 2015a, 2014b), namely the Relativistic Hartree-Fock
(HFR) method (Cowan 1981) that was modiﬁed to take core-
polarization eﬀects into account (HFR+CPOL), as described
by Quinet et al. (1999, 2002). In each Kr ion, the same core-
polarization parameters were used, i.e., a dipole polarizability
αd = 0.20 a3
0 and a cut-oﬀ radius rc = 0.55 a0. The former value,
taken from Johnson et al. (1983), corresponds to a Kr8+ closed-
shell ionic core of the type 1s22s22p63s23p63d10, while the latter
value was chosen as the mean value of hri for the outermost core
orbital (3d), as calculated by the HFR approach. Intravalence
correlations were considered by explicitly including the follow-
ing conﬁgurations in the physical models:

ity),

4s5p + 4s6p + 4s4f + 4s5f + 4s6f + 4p5s + 4p4d + 4p5d + 4d4f
(odd parity).

The HFR+CPOL method was then combined with a semi-
empirical optimization of the radial parameters to minimize the
discrepancies between calculated and experimental energy lev-
els. More precisely, the energy levels reported by Saloman
(2007) were used in Kr iv to adjust the radial parameters cor-
responding to the 4p3, 4p25p, 4s4p4, 4p24d, 4p25d, 4p25s, and
4p26s conﬁgurations.
In Kr v, the experimental level values
taken from Saloman (2007) and Rezende et al. (2010) were in-
cluded in the adjustment of some parameters in the 4p2, 4p5p,
4s4p24d, 4p4, 4s4p3, 4p4d, 4p5d, 4p5s, and 4p6s conﬁgurations.
In the case of Kr vi, the energy levels from Saloman (2007) and
Farias et al. (2011) enabled us to optimize the radial parame-
ters by describing the 4p, 5p, 4s4p4d, 4p3, 4s4p2, 4s24d, 4s25s,
4s4p4f, 4s4p5p, and 4p24d conﬁgurations. Finally, the energy
levels measured by Raineri et al. (2014) were used to ﬁt the pa-
rameters of the 4s2, 4p2, 4s4d, 4s5d, 4s6d, 4s5s, 4s6s, 4p4f, 4s4p,
4s5p, 4s6p, 4s4f, 4s5f, 4s6f, 4p5s, and 4p4d conﬁgurations in
Kr vii.

The numerical values of the parameters adopted in the
present calculations are reported in Tables 2-5, while the com-
puted energies for Kr iv-vii are compared with available exper-
imental values in Tables 6-9, respectively. Tables 10-13 give
the computed oscillator strengths (log g f ) and transition proba-
bilities (gA, in s−1) for Kr iv-vii, respectively, and the numerical
values (in cm−1) of lower and upper energy levels, together with
the corresponding wavelengths (in Å). The cancellation factor,
CF, as deﬁned by Cowan (1981) is also given in the last column
of each table. For a speciﬁc transition, a very small value of this
parameter (typically < 0.05) indicates strong cancellation eﬀects
in the calculation of the line strength. In this case, the corre-

sponding oscillator strength and transition probability could be
aﬀected by larger uncertainties and, as a consequence, should be
considered with care.

Tables 10-13 are provided in VO6-compliant format via
the registered7 Tübingen Oscillator Strengths Service (TOSS8,
Rauch et al. 2015a) that has recently been developed by GAVO.
For Kr iv-vii, oscillator strengths were previously published
by several authors. In the following, we compare our new data
to theirs. Figure 1 illustrates this comparison.

Bredice et al. (2000) calculated weighted oscillator strengths
for 471 spectral lines of Kr iv involving the 4s24p3, 4s4p4,
4s24p25p, and 4s24p2(5s + 6s + 4d + 5d) conﬁgurations within
the wavelength interval [501.50 Å, 4703.85 Å]. Of these lines,

320 agree within 0.1 Å to lines reported in Table 10. We selected
them to compare their log g f values to ours in Fig.1. As seen
from this ﬁgure, even if both sets of results agree for many lines,
a large scatter is also observed for many other lines. This is ob-
viously due to the very limited multiconﬁguration Hartree-Fock
model (including only two odd- and seven even-parity conﬁgu-
rations) that were considered by Bredice et al. (2000).

Raineri et al. (2012) published transition probabilities for
313 lines of Kr v ([294.27 Å, 3614.10 Å]). They were calculated
with Cowan’s package (Cowan 1981), i.e., the Hartree-Fock
method with relativistic corrections using energy parameters
from least-squares and dipole-reduced matrix from a core po-
larization calculation. A large set of 4s24p2, 4p5p, 4p4, 4s4p24d,
4p4f, 4s4p25s, 4s24d2, 4s4p4d5p, 4p34f, 4s4p4d4f, 4s24f2, and
4s4d3 even and 4s4p3, 4p4d, 4p5s, 4p5d, 4p6s, 4p5g, 4p6d,
4s4p25p, 4s4p24f, 4p34d, 4s4p26p, 4s4p4d2, 4p35s, 4s24d4f,
4s24f5s, 4p35d, 4s24f5d, 4s4d25p, and 4s4d24f odd conﬁgura-
tions was considered.

We selected 183 of these lines (by wavelength agreement
within 0.1 Å to lines in Table 11) and compared their log g f val-
ues to ours (Fig.1). Although a good agreement between the
two sets of data is observed for many lines, a large scatter is
also obtained for a number of transitions, in particular for those
corresponding to weak oscillator strengths, i.e., log g f < −2.
This is mainly due to the rather large cancellation eﬀects that ap-
pear in the calculations of these types of transition rates in both
works. Moreover, it is worth noting that Raineri et al. (2012)
modiﬁed only their electric dipole matrix elements to take core-
polarization eﬀects into account while, in our work, all the radial
wave functions were also modiﬁed by a model potential, includ-
ing one- and two-body core-polarization contributions, together
with a core-penetration correction (see, e.g., Quinet et al. 2002).
This could also explain some of the diﬀerences between the two
sets of results.

Pagan et al. (1996) calculated 138 weighted Kr vi oscilla-
tor strength ([331.65 Å, 2051.72 Å]) in a multiconﬁgurational
HFR approach considering 4s24p, 4p3, 4s25p, 4s4p4d, 4s24f,
4s4p5s, 4s26p, 4s4d4f, 4p24f, 4p4d2, and 4d24f conﬁgurations
for odd parity and 4s4p2, 4s24d, 4s25s, 4s25d, 4s4p4f, 4s4p5s,
4p24d, and 4s4d2 for even parity. Analogously to Kr v, we
compared the log g f values of 115 selected Kr vi lines with our
data (Fig.1). Although both sets of data are in good agreement,
we note that our oscillator strengths are generally smaller than
those obtained by Pagan et al. (1996). This is essentially due to
the much more extended multiconﬁguration expansions and the
core-polarization eﬀects that we include in our calculations.

Liang et al. (2013) presented oscillator strengths for 90 lines
([201.05 Å, 920.98 Å]) For Kr vii. For their calculations with the
AUTOSTRUCTURE code (Badnell 2011), they only use nine
conﬁgurations, i.e., 4s2, 4p2, 4s4d, 4s5s, 4s5d, and 4s4p, 4s4f,
4p4d, 4s5p for the even and odd parities, respectively. In particu-
lar, they omitt some conﬁgurations, such as 4d2 and 4d4f which,
according to our calculations, appeared to have non-negligible
interactions with 4s2, 4p2 and 4s4p, 4s4f, 4p4d, respectively. The
eﬀect of this rather limited model is illustrated in Fig.1, where
our log g f values, obtained with an extended conﬁguration inter-
action approach, are systematically smaller than those reported
by Liang et al. (2013).

ered opacities of H, He, C, N, O, and Si. They derived
Teﬀ = 70 000 ± 5000 K and log(g/cm/s2) = 7.5 ± 0.3. In their
spectral analysis based on H+He composed LTE model atmo-
spheres, Vennes et al. (1998) determined Teﬀ = 68 600 ± 1800 K
and log g = 7.20 ± 0.07. Dreizler (1999) improved the metal
abundance analysis of C, N, O, and Ni based on HST/GHRS
(Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph) observations and used
the previously determined Teﬀ = 70 000 K and log g = 7.5. The
same did Werner et al. (2012b) for their Kr and Xe abundance
analysis.
In our latest models, much more species (Table 14)
and, thus, a higher metal opacity is considered. Therefore, we
start here with a new assessment of Teﬀ and log g.

The decrements of spectral series are very sensitive indica-
tors for log g (e.g., Rauch et al. 1998; Ziegler et al. 2012). Fig-
ure 2 shows a comparison of theoretical line proﬁles of the He ii
Fowler series (principal quantum numbers n − n′ with n = 3
and n′ ≥ 4) that are located in our HST/STIS spectrum. The
central depressions of He ii 3 − [5, . . . , 13] are well matched at
log g = 7.5, while the decrement is much too strong at log g = 8.0,
and much too weak at log g = 7.0. We therefore verify log g = 7.5,
which was the result of Dreizler & Werner (1996), and improved
the error limit to ±0.1 dex.

Figure 4 demonstrates that the line wings of the He ii n = 2
and n′ ≥ 3 n = 4 and n′ ≥ 5 (Pickering) series are well in agree-
ment with the observation at log g = 7.5. A diﬀerent log g cannot
be compensated for by adapted interstellar H i densities because
this has a strong impact on the inner line wings (Sect. 6). The
error range for these densities is below 20%. Our optical spectra
corroborate the log g determination. Figure 4 shows the com-
parison of our models to the observations. He ii λ 6560 Å is too
shallow in all our models and does not match the TWIN obser-
vation. The reason is still unknown. The UVES spectra show
a slightly better ﬁt of this line, which may be a hint for some
data-reduction uncertainty in the TWIN and/or UVES spectra.
To make a comparison with the FUSE observation, we selected

6. Line identiﬁcation and abundance analysis

We replaced our previously used Kr model atom and recalcu-
lated our latest model atmosphere (see Rauch et al. 2015a). Fig-
ure 5 shows that, in general, the wavelengths of the old and the
new data are in good agreement, while the line strengths calcu-
lated with the new data are much smaller. There are three rea-
sons for this deviation. First, the Kr iv-vii model ions are much
more complete, e.g., for Kr vi and Kr vii, Werner et al. (2012b)
constructed model ions with 46 and 14 atomic levels that were
combined with 140 and 2 line transitions with known oscilla-
tor strengths, respectively. These numbers were increased to
69 and 70 levels with 843 and 743 line transitions, respectively
(Table 1). Second, the new oscillator strengths of the lines that
were used in the Kr abundance analysis are smaller in general
(Table 15). Third (with minor impact), the chemical composi-
tion of the model atmospheres is diﬀerent and the C, N, and O
abundances were ﬁne-tuned, i.e., the background opacity was
increased and, thus, the calculated atmospheric structure is dif-
ferent.

In their Kr abundance analysis, Werner et al. (2012b) use
He+C+N+O+Kr+Xe models and adopt the C, N, and O abun-
dances of Dreizler (1999). Our models also consider the opac-
ities of Si, P, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Ga, Ge,
As, Mo, Sn, and Ba. The C and O abundances were increased to
better reproduce their observed lines. The abundances are com-
pared in Table 14. Figure 6 shows the temperature structures of
the respective models. Deviations are obvious in the outer atmo-
sphere, but also in the line-forming region (−4 <∼ log m <∼ +0.5,
m is the column mass, measured from the outer boundary of our
model atmospheres).

Due to the higher background opacity in our models, the cal-
culated Kr lines are weaker compared with Werner et al. (2012b,
log Kr = −4.3 ± 0.5). To match the observation, we have to
increase the previously determined Kr mass fraction (log Kr =
−4.3 ± 0.5, Werner et al. 2012b) by a factor of 10 to 5.1 × 10−4
(log Kr = −3.3 ± 0.3). Our given error is estimated, considering
the error propagation that is due to the uncertainties of Teﬀ, log g
and the background opacity (Sect. 5).

Figure 7 shows that Kr v-vii are the dominant ions in the
line-forming region. We newly identiﬁed Kr vi λ 1052.067 Å
(log g f = −0.55) in the FUSE observation and for the ﬁrst
time lines of Kr v, namely λλ 1384.611, 1387.961, 1392.594,
1393.603, 1515.611, 1566.073, 1583.456, 1589.269, 1591.875,
1764.478 Å (−0.59, −0.65, −0.67, −0.17, 0.40, 0.30, 0.25,
0.68, 0.49, −0.16, respectively) in the HST/STIS observation
(Fig. 8). These lines are in agreement with the observation, while
Kr v λλ 1583.456, 1591.875, 1764.478 Å are uncertain. Many
more weak Kr v-vii lines are exhibited in the synthetic spectrum
but they fade in the noise of the available observed UV and opti-
cal spectra. The Kr v-vii ionization equilibrium is well matched.
Since ionization equilibria are sensitive indicators of the eﬀec-
tive temperature, our value of Teﬀ = 70 000 K (Sect. 5) is corrob-
orated.

With our new Kr oscillator strengths and also at the higher
Kr abundance, a simultaneous ﬁt of all 26 identiﬁed lines was
achieved. For example, Kr vi λλ 944.046, 965.093, 1011.133,
1015.765, 1052.964 Å were much too weak before in our models
but now reproduce the observation (Fig. 5).

In the optical wavelength range, Kr v λ 3579.739 Å (log g f =
−1.15, air wavelength 3578.717 Å) is the strongest line in our
model but very weak (central depression of about 1 % of the local
continuum ﬂux) and not detectable in the available observation.

had to be applied to reproduce the observed FUV continuum
ﬂux, using the reddening law of Fitzpatrick (1999) with the stan-
dard Rv = 3.1. Our EB−V value is in good agreement with mea-
surements of Schlegel et al. (1998, evaluating images from the
Diﬀuse Infrared Background Experiment on board of the Cos-
mic Background Explorer satellite, COBE/DIRBE, and the In-
frared Astronomy Satellite Sky Survey Atlas, IRAS/ISSA) and
Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011, based on Sloan Digital Sky Sur-
vey, SDSS, stellar spectra). They publish EB−V = 0.0160 and
EB−V = 0.0138, respectively. The errors can be estimated from
the mean values of EB−V within a 5◦ circle around RE 0503−289.
These are E5◦
B−V = 0.0155 ± 0.0008 and 0.0134 ± 0.0006,
respectively. The dust distribution around RE 0503−289 and
RE 0457−281 is illustrated by Fig. 11. While RE 0503−289 is
apparently located in the middle of a voided area, RE 0457−281
lies at the rim of stronger emission, with a higher EB−V = 0.0201
(E5◦

B−V = 0.0203 ± 0.0004, Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011).
The DAO-type WD 0458−303 (MCT 0458−3020, mB =

RE 0503−289 (angular distance 1◦53, Fig. 11) in an area with
obviously less 100 µ emission and a lower EB−V = 0.0082
(E5◦

While RE 0503−289 and RE 0457−281 were newly identi-
ﬁed in the ROSAT/WFC (Röntgensatellit/Wide Field Camera)
extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) bright source catalogue (Pounds et al.

optical counterparts (Mason et al. 1995, 1996), the much hot-
ter WD 0458−303 has no signiﬁcant EUV ﬂux. Therefore, an

sorption in the LOS toward this much more distant star is highly

Figure 12 shows a section of the FUSE observation com-
pared with our spectrum that was calculated with the new
Kr model atom and log Kr = −3.3. Kr vii λ 918.444 Å and
Kr vi λλ 927.334, 931.368 Å are prominent in the observed spec-
trum and are well reproduced, while Kr v λ 916.734 Å and
Kr vi λ 919.938 Å are weak in our model and fade in the noise
of the observation.

The program OWENS was used to model the line absorp-
tion by the interstellar medium (ISM). OWENS is able to con-
sider individual ISM clouds with diﬀerent radial and turbulent
velocities, temperatures, column densities, and chemical com-
positions. Voigt proﬁles are ﬁtted to the observation using
a χ2 minimization. More details are given by, for example,
Hébrard et al. (2002) or Hébrard & Moos (2003). To model the
interstellar absorption of neutral hydrogen, we ﬁrst considered
two clouds with column densities of NH i = 1.2 × 1018 cm−2 and
NH i = 9.3 × 1015 cm−2, and radial velocities of vISM
rad = +10.0 and
−39.3 km s−1, respectively. These column densities are smaller
than the expected value of 9.2 ± 0.3 × 1018 cm−2 that was calcu-
lated from NH / EB−V = 6.12 ± 0.20 × 1021 atoms cm−2 mag−1
(Gudennavar et al. 2012, with NH = NH i + 2N(H2)).

Vennes et al. (1994) analyzed Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer
(EUVE) photometry data and measured column densities of
log(NH i / cm−2), = 17.75−18.00 and 17.80−17.90 in the LOS to-
ward RE 0503−289 and the nearby (spatially separated by 1◦.66)
RE 0457−281.
Since Hoare et al. (1993) and Vallerga et al.
(1993) determined log(NH i / cm−2) = 18.00 − 18.18 for β and
ǫ CMa (located in about the same direction, at angular distances
of 21◦ and 31◦, respectively, but at larger distances of d = 206 pc
and d = 188 pc, respectively), Vennes et al. (1994) suggested
that the local cloud, agglomerated with a few parsecs from the
Sun, is the main ISM structure along the LOS toward these
stars. Vennes et al. (1998) used ORFEUS/BEFS13 observations
and measured vRE 0503−289
rad = 48 ± 21 km s−1, which is
within error limits in agreement with the mean velocity of our
two clouds. Dupuis et al. (1995) investigated interstellar col-
umn densities based on EUVE spectra. For RE 0457−281, they
found d = 90 pc and log(NH i / cm−2) = 18.04 − 18.12. ) mea-

The interstellar N ii λ 915.6 Å also exhibits a double feature
(Fig. 12). We considered this line with column densities of
NN ii = 7.5×1013cm−2 at +11.0 km s−1 and NN ii = 2.5×1013cm−2
at −39.5 km s−1. The HST/STIS observation is used to verify our
solution with two ISM clouds (Fig. 13). While Si iii λ 1206.5 Å
is not suﬃciently well reproduced with NS iii = 1.8 × 1013cm−2 at
+18.0 km s−1 and NS iii = 1.9 × 1012cm−2 at −40.5 km s−1 (insert

the agreement (main spectra). The assumed clouds’ column den-
sities and radial velocities are summarized in Table 16.

While the outer line wings of H i L α are dominated by stel-
lar He ii absorption, the inner line wings are well matched at
a total NH i = 1.5 × 1018 cm−2. To reproduce the blue side of
the observed absorption core, a signiﬁcant D i column density
of ND i = 1.2 × 1014 cm−2 is necessary. This value is uncertain
because this line is saturated and blended by stellar He ii and in-
terstellar H i. Therefore, we consider D i with a single ISM cloud
at 12.1 km s−1. The region around L α is well reproduced with
either a two-cloud (insert “B’) or a multi-cloud solution for H i.
Figure 14 shows that a multi-cloud solution can explain the
strong and weak ISM absorption lines in the observations of
RE 0503−289 and RE 0457−281. To simulate the stellar ﬂux
of RE 0457−281, we used a synthetic spectrum (pure hydro-
gen, Teﬀ = 58 000 K, log g = 7.9) which was provided by the Ger-
man Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO14) Theoretical
Stellar Spectra Access service (TheoSSA15). The ISM line ab-
sorption was modeled with the same parameters that were used
for RE 0503−289. We ﬁnd a good agreement for RE 0457−281
and RE 0503−289, although they have diﬀerent distances of
116±14 pc and 150+17
−18 pc, respectively, which are in rough agree-
ment within their error limits (Fig. 15). This issue will be clari-
ﬁed by the results of GAIA16 in the near future.

This corroborates the suggestion of Vennes et al. (1994) that
the major contribution to the ISM absorption stems from the so-
called local ﬂuﬀ in which our Sun is located. Nearly all of the
gas along the LOS toward RE 0503−289 and RE 0457−281, and
at distances well beyond these, is very hot and highly ionized.
The gas that we see occupies only a small fraction of the total
distance to the stars.

The main interstellar gas component toward RE 0503−289
is located near vhelio = +15 km s−1, as evident from the H i
21 cm emission spectrum in this direction from the Leiden-
Argentina-Bonn (LAB) survey (Kalberla et al. 2005). Also
the STIS spectrum of RE 0503−289 indicates strong interstel-
lar absorption at vhelio ≈ +15 km s−1 in the strong resonance
lines of C ii λ 1334.5 Å, Si iii λ 1206.5 Å, Si ii λ 1260.4 Å, and
others. As well as this main absorption component,
there
is weaker interstellar/circumstellar absorption extending blue-
wards until −60 km s−1, including another distinct (weak) ab-
sorption component near vhelio = −40 km s−1 (Fig. 14). The
strong C ii λ 1334.5 Å and Si iii λ 1206.5 Å lines show additional
weak absorption between −30 km s−1 and zero velocities, but
without a clear component structure.

Fig. 13.
Section of the STIS observation around L α, compared with our ﬁnal synthetic spectrum (thick, red, Teﬀ = 70 000 K, log g = 7.5). The
dashed, blue lines are the pure photospheric model-atmosphere spectra (Teﬀ = 70 000 K, log g = 7.0, 7.5, 8.0), i.e., no interstellar line absorption is
applied. See text for the description of inserts A and B.

The H i Lyman series absorption can also be best ﬁt with
two neutral gas components at +15 and −40 km s−1, with a total
column density of NH i = 1.5 × 1018 cm−2.

In the metal ions, the satellite component at −40 km s−1 is
relatively narrow with a b-value of just 2.5 km s−1. The simulta-
neous presence of weak C ii, Si ii, Si iii, and H i absorption (and
possibly O vi; Fig. 14), together with the narrow line shape, in-
dicates a relatively compact, low-column density gas structure
with multiphase gas that causes the absorption at negative veloc-
ities.

To estimate the contribution of the circumstellar material
to the ISM absorption in the LOS toward RE 0503−289 and
RE 0457−281, we estimated the densities of planetary nebulae
(PNe) that were ejected at the end of the AGB phases of both
stars. We assumed expansion velocities of vexp = 20 km s−1. Be-
cause of the very long post-AGB times, these PNe have swept up
all stellar material ejected in the slow (≈ 10 km s−1) AGB-wind
phase before, and their so-called radii indicate the maximum dis-
tance from the star that ejected material would have reached.

Table 17 summarizes radii, volumes, masses, and densities
of the expected PNe. The estimated column densities are orders
of magnitude lower than those that are necessary to reproduce
the observation, even if RE 0503−289 lies beyond the circum-
stellar material of RE 0457−281. However, the ejected PN ma-
terial may have compressed accelerated ambient interstellar gas,
so that the −40 km s−1 component toward RE 0503−289 may be
a result of the interaction between circumstellar and interstellar
material at the interface between both components.

9. Results and conclusions

We reanalyzed the eﬀective temperature and surface gravity and
determined Teﬀ = 70 000 ± 2000 K and log g = 7.5 ± 0.1. This
veriﬁes the results of Dreizler & Werner (1996) within im-
proved, rather small, error limits.

For precise NLTE spectral analyses, reliable transition prob-
abilities are required, not only for lines that are identiﬁed in the
observation, but also for the complete model atoms that are con-
sidered in the model-atmosphere calculations. Therefore, our

proved NLTE spectral analysis. The new data enabled us to
construct a more realistic Kr model atom. We improved the
previous determination of the Kr abundance in RE 0503−289
(Werner et al. 2012b), taking these oscillator strengths into con-
sideration.

In addition to the already known 15 Kr vi-vii

lines in
the observed high-resolution UV spectrum of RE 0503−289
(Werner et al. 2012b), we identiﬁed one Kr vi line and, for the
ﬁrst time in this star, ten lines of Kr v. Our synthetic line proﬁles
reproduce well the observation at a photospheric Kr abundance
of 2.5×10−4−1.0×10−3 (log Kr = −3.3±0.3). This is 2300−9200
times the solar abundance (Grevesse et al. 2015). This highly su-
persolar Kr abundance goes along with the high abundances of
other trans-iron elements in RE 0503−289 (Fig. 16). The Kr v-vii
ionization equilibrium is well reproduced (Figs. 5, 8).

Iron is the only element in Fig. 16 with an upper abundance
limit (Fe/He < 10−6 by number, about a hundredth of the solar
abundance, Scott et al. 2015a). Barstow et al. (2000) determined
this value by a co-addition (in the velocity space) of the nine Fe v
lines that were predicted to be strongest in the HST/GHRS spec-
trum. In Fig 17, we compare theoretical line proﬁles of the most
prominent Fe v lines in the FUSE and HST/STIS wavelength
range to the observation. The upper limit for the Fe abundance
of 0.01 times solar is veriﬁed. Therefore, the reason why the
