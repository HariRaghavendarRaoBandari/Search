Recently, a new kind of two dimensional (2D) artiﬁcial electron lattice, i.e. molecule graphene,
has drawn a lots of interest, where the metal surface electrons are transformed into a honeycomb
lattice via absorbing a molecule lattice on metal surface[1, 2]. In this work, we would like to point
out that the technique used to build molecule graphene actually gives a promising way to explore
the interesting physics of other novel 2D lattice beyond graphene. The key issue is that this system
is an antidot system, where the absorbed molecule normally gives a repulsive potential. So, we need
to establish a map between the molecule arrangement and the desired surface electron lattice. To
give a concrete example, we ﬁrst analyse the eﬀective models of molecule graphene, and estimate
the model parameters for the Cu/CO system through numerical ﬁtting the exerimental data. Then,
we design a molecule lattice, and show that, with this kind of lattice, the surface electrons can
be transformed into a Kagome like lattice. Using the estimated parameters of Cu/CO system, we
calculate the corresponding energy bands and LDOS, which can be readily tested in experiment.
We hope that our work can stimulate further theoretical and experimental interest in this novel
artiﬁcial 2D electron lattice.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, a novel kind of artiﬁcial two dimensional
(2D) electronic lattice, named molecule graphene, has
been successfully realized on metal surface in order to
mimic the Dirac like linear dispersion of graphene[1, 2].
In experiment[1], CO molecules are absorbed on Cu(111)
surface and then assembled into a hexagonal lattice by
the tip of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The
Cu(111) surface has a Shockley surface state near the
Fermi level, which can be viewed as a two dimensional
electron gas with k2 dispersion. Meanwhile, each ab-
sorbed molecule applies a local potential on the surface
states, and thus the molecule lattice is equivalent to a
lateral periodic potential, which transforms the surface
electrons into an artiﬁcial honeycomb lattice[3].

Artiﬁcial 2D lattice systems are always the research fo-
cus during the last two decades, because that it not only
relates to the fundamental physics about 2D system, but
also has potential for application. The nano-patterned
semiconductor 2DEG, cold atom, and the photonic crys-
tal are the well-known artiﬁcial 2D lattice systems, which
have been intensively studied. Here, the metal surface
state patterned by the absorbed molecules oﬀers a new
artiﬁcial 2D lattice system, where molecule graphene is
ﬁrst example realized in experiment. This new artiﬁcial
2D system has its own characteristic and merits. First, it
is a 2D electron lattice in solid state system in contrast to
the cold atom and photonic crystal systems, so that the
electron-electron interaction can be included naturally.
Moreover, because the 2D electrons are the surface states,
the STM gives a powerful detecting method, which not
only can measure the DOS, LDOS, but also could get the

accurate information about the edge states[2], charge or-
der, the spin order (by spin-polarized STM[4]), and even
the quasi particle energy (by inelastic electron tunnelling
spectroscopy). These critical information can not be eas-
ily detected in other artiﬁcial 2D lattice systems. Consid-
ering these great advantages, this new artiﬁcial 2D lattice
system deserves more research eﬀorts.

So far, all the investigations about the molecule
graphene system (i.e. metal surface electrons patterned
by absorbed molecule lattice) are mainly focused on the
physics of graphene, e.g.
the linear dispersion[1, 5–7],
edge and impurity states[2], ﬁnite size eﬀect[8], topolog-
ical nontrivial phases[9, 10] and superconductivity[11].
However, it should be noticed that this powerful tech-
nique actually provides a promising method to study in-
teresting physics in any 2D electron lattice, not just the
graphene lattice. To the best of our knowledge, there
are still few works to discuss the possibility to construct
other novel 2D lattices on metal surface by this tech-
nique. One critical issue is that, like the Cu/CO system,
the absorbed molecule normally applies a repulsive po-
tential on the metal surface state, so that it is an antidot
system. To get a desired 2D lattice of surface electrons,
we need to design a special molecule arrangement, and
thus numerical simulation with realistic parameters be-
comes indispensable.

In this work, we ﬁrst theoretically analyse the two ef-
fective models of the molecule graphene used in litera-
tures, discuss their relation and diﬀerences. By numerical
simulation and comparing with the experimental data,
we estimate the parameters of diﬀerent eﬀective models
for the Cu/CO system, which is an ideal system to con-
struct 2D lattice of surface electron. We point out that
the potential value of the absorbed CO molecules in the
muﬃn-tin model is of the order of several eV, which is a
critical parameter to simulate other 2D lattice in Cu/CO
system. Then, with these estimated parameters, we give

an interesting example which can be readily tested in
experiment. We design a 2D molecule lattice and show
that, with this kind of molecule arrangement, we can get
a band structure rather similar to that of Kagome lattice,
which is of special interest in condensed matter physics.
We hope that our work can stimulate further theoretical
and experimental interests in this promising artiﬁcial 2D
electronic lattice system.

The paper is organized as following: In Sec.

II, we
discuss the two eﬀective models of molecule graphene,
and estimate the parameters of the eﬀective models for
the Cu/CO system; In Sec.
III, we design a molecule
arrangement and show that it can give a Kagome like
band structure via numerical simulation; Finally, we give
a summary in Sec. IV.

II. EFFECTIVE MODELS OF MOLECULE

GRAPHENE

Basically, the molecule graphene is one kind of artiﬁ-
cial graphene, which was ﬁrst proposed in the semicon-
ductor 2DEG system[3, 12, 13]. In the literatures, except
the DFT calculation[5], two eﬀective models using diﬀer-
ent potential models are used to describe such artiﬁcial
graphene system. For the artiﬁcial graphene, they both
work and are equivalent in some sense. However, only
the eﬀective model with muﬃn-tin potential is a general
model which is applicable to all the 2D lattice. In addi-
tion, we emphasize that the potential values of the two
eﬀective models are of diﬀerent physical meanings, and of
diﬀerent order of magnitude. Sometimes, they are con-
fused in literatures since which eﬀective model is used is
not declared.

In order to do a realistic simulation for other 2D lat-
tices, we ﬁrst need to get some critical parameters of the
Cu/CO system by analysing the eﬀective models and the
experimental results of the molecule graphene. Here, we
only focus on the Cu/CO system, since it has been real-
ized in experiment and is an ideal system to build other
2D lattice. For other systems, e.g. other molecules[2],
simulation can be done in the same way.

A. Two Potential Models

To describe the molecule graphene system, the Cu(111)
surface state is approximately considered as a 2DEG.
When the absorbed molecule lattice is formed, it exerts a
lateral periodic potential on the surface electrons. So far,
in the literatures, there are two kinds of potential models
used to simulate the lateral periodic potential. One is the
muﬃn-tin potential model[2, 3], as shown in Fig. 1. The
Hamiltonian of the whole system is

ameter of the molecule potential disk. (b) The corresponding

where the muﬃn-tin potential U (r) is U0 > 0 inside the
gray disks and zero elsewhere, m∗ = 0.38m0 is the ef-
fective mass of the Cu(111) surface state, and the Fermi
energy relative to the band bottom is Ef = 450 meV. To
calculate the energy bands, we can expend the Hamilto-
nian with the plane wave basis and get the central equa-
tions

G′

G and G′ are the reciprocal lattice in momentum space,
ck is the coeﬃcient of the plane wave and UG is the
Fourier component of the muﬃn-tin potential. As shown
in Fig. 1 (a), there are three parameters for the muﬃn-
tin potential: the lattice constant of the molecule lattice
a0, the diameter of the potential disk d and the potential
value U0. We can get an analytical expression about the
Fourier component of the muﬃn-tin potential

UG =

(3)

Here, Ω is the unit cell area of the molecule lattice, J1
is the Bessel function. Given the muﬃn-tin potential,
we can get the energy bands of the molecule graphene by
solving the central equations above. The Dirac like linear
dispersion is only related with the lowest three bands.

The other potential model for the molecule graphene
is actually a simpliﬁcation of the muﬃn-tin potential.
When calculating the energy bands with the central
equations, it is shown that, for the molecule graphene
case, the ﬁrst Fourier component UG0 dominates, where
|G0| = |b1| = |b2| = |b1 − b2|, b1 and b2 are the basis of
reciprocal lattice. Thus, in some theoretical literatures,
only the UG0 terms are considered as the potential model
to simulate the molecule graphene, which we call the UG0
model here[1, 13, 14]. The beneﬁt of the UG0 model is
that there is now only one potential parameter, i.e. the
value of UG0, for the band calculation instead of the two

in the muﬃn-tin potential case (U0 and d). Note that the
molecule distance a0 is the same in any potential mod-
els. So, it is convenient to use the UG0 model for both the
numerical calculation and the ﬁtting of the experiment.
We want to emphasize here that when we talk about the
potential value of molecule graphene system, it should
be aware of which potential model is used. Otherwise,
it is easier to confuse U0 and UG0, since they all have
the dimension of energy and are both named as potential
value.

The disadvantage of the UG0 model is that it is not
transferable for studying other 2D lattice, which is one
of the main purposes of this work. On one side, there
is no direct relation between the UG0 terms of diﬀerent
2D lattices, even if the same molecules are used. On
the other side, for some 2D lattices, only including the
UG0 terms is not enough to correctly describe the energy
bands. It should be noticed that the muﬃn-tin potential
model is naturally applicable for all kinds of 2D lattice,
though it is not as convenient as the UG0 model for the
experiment ﬁtting since more potential parameters are
involved. Once we get the parameters of the muﬃn-tin
potential in the Cu/CO system, it can be straightfor-
wardly used to simulate the case of other 2D lattice.

For convenience, in the following, we will ﬁrst use the
UG0 model to ﬁt the experimental data of the molecule
graphene in Cu(111)/CO system. Then, with Eq. 3,
we estimate the parameters of the muﬃn-tin potential,
which is applicable to other 2D lattice. Finally, using
the muﬃn-tin potential, we give an interesting example
in next section.

B. Numerical Simulation

Let us ﬁrst discuss the experimental results of the
In exper-
molecule graphene in Cu(111)/CO system.
iment, the molecule graphene is identiﬁed by measur-
ing the graphene like DOS, as well as the honeycomb
LDOS pattern, with STM[1, 2]. Thus, in our calcula-
tion, we only focus on the simulation about the DOS
with the eﬀective model, while the band structure of the
molecule graphene has been discussed in detail in for-
mer literatures[3, 14]. Without the absorbed molecules,
the Cu surface states can be approximately viewed as
a 2DEG with a parabolic dispersion, the DOS of which
is about ρCu = 1.6 × 10−3 meV−1nm−2. Note that the
DOS of pure Cu surface states is used to scale the DOS of
the molecule graphene in experiment[1]. The detail DOS
data of the molecule graphene is given in Ref. 1 with
molecule lattice constant a0 = 1.92 nm (see the Fig. 1 of
the supplementary material of Ref. 1). The DOS shape
of the molecule graphene is similar as that of graphene,
where the DOS minimum is near the Dirac point and two
DOS peaks are near the two Van Hove singularities below
and above the Dirac point, respectively. Beyond the com-
mon features, the observed DOS of molecule graphene
has some quantitatively characteristics: (1) the ampli-

tude of the DOS peaks, ρP 1 − ρD ≈ 1.1 × ρCu, where ρP 1
(ρP 2) is the DOS value of the lower (upper) DOS peak rel-
ative to the Dirac point. ρD is the minimum of the DOS
near the Dirac point; (2) the two DOS peaks are asym-
metry. The ratio R = |ρP 1 − ρD|/|ρP 2 − ρD| is about 1.9;
(3) the relative energy positions of the two peaks, ∆E1 =

where EP 1, EP 2, ED are the energy of the lower DOS
peak , the upper DOS peak, the DOS minimum, respec-
tively. Then, based on the eﬀective model of molecule
graphene, we would like to see in which parameter re-
gion the calculated DOS can reproduce the experimental
results.

For the DOS calculation, the life time broadening of
the energy level, resulting from the scattering between
the surface electrons and bulk states, is a crucial quantity
because that it determines the magnitude of DOS value.

In experiment, it is estimated that the energy broadening
is about 40 meV in Cu(111)/CO system[1].

Now, we discuss the numerical results of the UG0
model, from which we want to estimate the reasonable
value of UG0 by comparing with the experimental DOS

graphene as a function of UG0 (a0 = 1.92 nm), where
∆E is the energy relative to the band bottom. A typical
DOS is shown in Fig.2 (b), which is like that of graphene.
In order to do quantitative comparisons, we plot the
amplitude of the two DOS peaks, as well as their ratio
R = |ρP 1−ρD |
|ρP 2−ρD | , in Fig. 2 (c) as a function of UG0. Mean-
while, the relative energy position of the two DOS peaks
are also given in Fig. 2 (d). According to these data, we
can roughly identify three distinct UG0 regions as indi-
cated in Fig. 2 (a), and we plot the typical DOS curves in
the three regions in Fig. 2 (e). In small UG0 region (Re-
gion I), the amplitude of the DOS peaks are tiny, which is
qualitatively inconsistent with the experiment [the black
solid line in Fig. 2 (e)]. In moderate UG0 region (Region
II), the amplitude of the two DOS peaks becomes larger
and is comparable to the experimental value, but the two
DOS peaks are nearly symmetrical [the red dashed line
in Fig. 2 (e)]. The asymmetry ration R is around 1,
which is also qualitatively diﬀerent from the experimen-
tal observation. Only if the UG0 is large enough, we can
get a reasonable DOS shape, which is qualitatively in
agreement with the experimental observation. However,
from the DOS data above, we can not get a satisﬁed
quantitative ﬁtting with this eﬀective model, which can
exactly reproduce the experimental data. For example,
if the amplitude of ﬁrst DOS peak |ρP 1 − ρD| is exactly
equal to the experimental value, the UG0 should be in the
moderate UG0 region and give a symmetrical DOS shape.
Meanwhile, in the large UG0 region, the relative position
of the two peaks are about 20 meV larger than the ex-
perimental value (from 20 meV to 30 meV depending on
UG0 value).

Considering all the numerical results above, we sug-
gest that, for the molecule graphene in Cu/CO system,
the acceptable region of UG0 is between 400 meV to 600
meV. Only if UG0 is in this region, we can get a reason-
able DOS shape, while the peak amplitude, peak position
and asymmetry ratio is comparable to the experimental
value. Two important issues should be made clear fur-
ther. One is that, in former studies, the value UG0 is
estimated by the energy diﬀerence between the M point
and Dirac point in the BZ, and it is argued that UG0
is about 100 meV[1, 13]. However, when the life time
broadening is considered in the DOS calculation, it is
obvious that the DOS peaks are not at the M point and
the DOS minimum is also shifted from the Dirac point.
That is why the UG0 value suggested here is larger than
the former one. We plot the DOS with suggested UG0
values in Fig. 2 (f). The other is that even in this UG0
region, there is still a diﬀerence about 20 meV between
the experimental and theoretical values of the position of
the DOS peaks. We argue that this discrepancy may re-

sult from the assumption about the life time broadening,
where it is considered as a constant in our calculation.
Actually, the life time broadening of the metal surface
states has been intensively studied, and normally it is a
function of energy[15]. To get a better eﬀective model is
still an open question and need further eﬀorts in future.

We then estimate the parameters of the muﬃn-tin
potential with Eq. 3. Except the lattice constant a0,
which is controlled in experiment, the muﬃn-tin poten-
tial model has two parameters: potential value U0 and
diameter d. Given UG0, the Eq. 3 indicates that U0 is a
function of d. In Fig. 3 (a), we plot U0 as a function of
d for diﬀerent UG0 values. According to the charge dif-
ference got by DFT calculation, the potential diameter
d of the CO molecule should be in the region between
0.5 nm to 0.7 nm[5]. As indicated in Fig. 3 (a), we can
see that the U0 should be in the region between 4 eV
and 10 eV. Note that the U0 is larger than 1 eV even if
UG0 = 100 meV. Thus, it is safely to say that the U0 of
muﬃn-tin potential is of several eV for the Cu/CO sys-
tem, which is the central result for this section. Here,
we give some further evidence from the related quantum
corral system to support our estimation above[16–18]. In
the well-known quantum corral system, adatoms (e.g Fe
atoms) are absorbed on Cu(111) surface to form a cor-
ral, which conﬁnes the surface electrons and gives rise
to a standing wave pattern in the corral. Similar as the
molecule graphene, each adatom applies a local poten-
tial on the surface electrons. By ﬁtting the experiment,
it is suggested that the potential value of the adatom is
about several eV[17, 18]. Together with our calculation,
we believe that our estimation about the U0 is reason-
able. Note that the potential value U0 are diﬀerent for
diﬀerent molecules. Our estimation is only applicable
for the Cu/CO system. In the following, we assume us-
ing Cu/CO system by default, and use U0 = 8 eV and
d = 0.6 nm for further study, the DOS of which is plotted
in Fig. 3 (b).

III. AN EXAMPLE: ARTIFICIAL KAGOME

LATTICE

In last section, we discuss the eﬀective model of
molecule graphene. For the Cu/CO system, we estimate
the reasonable value for U0 and d, which is applicable to
all the 2D lattice. In this part, we would like to give an in-
teresting example which is beyond the scope of graphene
physics. We design a 2D molecule lattice, and by simula-
tion with muﬃn-tin model, we show that this 2D lattice
can mimic the band structure of Kagome lattice. As
well known, the Kagome lattice is of highly interests in
condensed matter physics because of its novel correlated
ground state[19–22]. So far, in solid state electron sys-
tem, a clean Kagome lattice, as simple as graphene, has
not been found. Our scheme may oﬀer a novel platform
to study the physics of Kagome lattice.

The molecule arrangement we designed is shown in Fig.
4 (a), where each gray disk represents a molecule and the
unit cell is indicated by the red line. The basic idea is sim-
ple. First, we arrange the molecules to form a hexagonal
lattice. If we assume that each lattice site of the surface
electron is positioned at the inner of diamond formed by
four adjacent molecules, we then get a same hexagonal
lattice for the surface electrons. It should be noted that
if one quarter of the lattice sites is deleted, the hexago-
nal lattice can be transformed into the Kagome lattice.
Thus, we use an additional molecule to “kill” one lattice
site, as shown in Fig. 4 (a). There are three sites in one
unit cell of the Kagome lattice, which is marked by the
blue stars in Fig. 4 (a) (A, B, C sites). Meanwhile, the
nearest neighbourhood hopping are denoted as t and t′,
where the hopping between B and C sites (t′) is diﬀer-
ent from that between A and B (t). The corresponding
Kagome lattice is given in Fig. 4 (c).

We then use the muﬃn-tin potential with the param-
eters of Cu/CO system estimated above to simulate the
artiﬁcial Kagome lattice system. The lowest three bands
are plotted in Fig. 4 (d) (the black solid line). We try
to use a tight binding model to ﬁt the calculated band,
and the results are plotted in Fig. 4 (d) (the red dotted
line). The tight binding Hamiltonian is

In spite of our best eﬀorts, we only get a qualitatively
ﬁtting about the energy bands, which is not as good as
the case of molecule graphene. The parameters are t =
78.5 meV, t′ = 50 meV, ǫA = 80 meV and ǫB = ǫC = 40
meV. The numerical simulation demonstrates that the

molecule structure we designed can be roughly viewed as
a Kagome lattice with non-equal nearest neighbourhood
hopping. The corresponding DOS is given in Fig. 5 with
diﬀerent life time broadening. For Kagome lattice, one
of the three bands is very ﬂat, and thus induce a giant
DOS peak (see in Fig. 5), which may induce interesting
correlated electronic states in experiment. Meanwhile,

eﬀective models of the molecule graphene. We discuss
the relation and distinction between the two potential
models used to simulate the molecule graphene. Then,
by ﬁtting the DOS data, we estimate the parameters for
each potential model in the Cu/CO system. We point
out that, for the muﬃn-tin potential, potential value U0
is of the order of several eV and potential diameter d
is between 0.5 and 0.7 nm, which can be used to simu-
late any other 2D molecule lattice in the Cu/CO system.
Finally, we give an interesting example. We design a
molecule lattice, and by numerical simulation we show
that this molecule arrangement can give a Kagome like
band structure. Note that in experiment there are two
ways to build a molecular lattice on metal surface. One
is by the STM tips, as discussed above. The other is to
use the self-assembly process, where organic porous net-
works are used to conﬁne the surface electrons[23, 24].
However, it is still a big challenge to build a complex 2D
lattice of surface electron by the self-assembly technique,
though it is useful to make a molecule network in a large
area.

The molecule graphene represents a new kind of artiﬁ-
cial 2D electron lattice system, which has its own advan-
tages compared with other artiﬁcial 2D lattice systems,
e.g. the cold atom, nano-patterned 2DEG in semicon-
ductor, and photonic crystal. It of course will not only
limited to the graphene system, but also can be used to
study any novel 2D lattice. From the success of molecule
graphene, we believe that the technique is now ready.
But it should be noted that the molecule graphene is a
quantum antidot system. To build the desired 2D lattice,
we need a map from the molecule arrangement to the 2D
surface electron lattice we want. That is what we do in
this work. Our scheme here give a theoretical proposal to
get a Kagome like 2D lattice. And the estimation about
the model parameters of the Cu/CO system also gives a
basis for future numerical simulation. We hope that our
work can stimulate more research interest into this new
artiﬁcial 2D lattice system, and believe that it will lead
to new experimental progress in near future.

potential with estimated parameters U0 = 8.0eV , d = 0.6nm,

the Fermi level is controllable by adjusting the molecule
distance a0.

The main reason for the discrepancy between the tight
binding bands and the ones got by plane wave method is
because that each site of the surface electrons here has
inner electron structure. This can be seen from the LDOS
of this Kagome lattice, as shown in Fig. 6. In each site,
e.g. the B site, the electron distribution is not uniform,
and seems to be composed of two small sites. However,
we try several possible tight bind models and do not get
a better approximation. Anyway, ignoring the detailed
inner electronic structure in each site, the LDOS can be
viewed as a Kagome lattice, which is consistent with the
energy band calculation and can be described by the tight
binding model above. Since in our simulation we use the
realistic parameters of Cu/CO system, we believe that
the Kagome lattice structure proposed here can be easily
tested in experiment.

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, the purpose of this work is to point out
that the technique used to build molecule graphene in
recent experiments oﬀers a new opportunity to explore
the novel physics in any 2D lattice beyond the scope of
graphene. To demonstrate this idea, we ﬁrst analyze the
