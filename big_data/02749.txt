We deal with magnetic structures that attain integer and half-integer skyrmion numbers. We
model and solve the problem analytically, and show how the solutions appear in materials that en-
gender distinct, very speciﬁc physical properties, and use them to describe their topological features.
In particular, we found a way to model skyrmion with a large transition region correlated with the
presence of a two-peak skyrmion number density. Moreover, we run into the issue concerning the
topological strength of a vortex-like structure and suggest an experimental realization, important
to decide how to modify and measure the topological strength of the magnetic structure.

INTRODUCTION

Topological structures play important role in nonlinear
science and may come out as kinks, domain walls, vor-
tices, strings, monopoles, skyrmions and other localized
solutions [1–3]. They are static solutions that appear in
diﬀerent spatial dimensions, and in this work we study
planar systems, focusing attention on magnetic domains
[2] that behave as magnetic spin textures of the vortex or
skyrmion type. Such magnetic excitations are of current
interest, and have been investigated in a diversity of con-
texts, in particular in the recent works [4–25], where fab-
rication and tailoring of skyrmions and skyrmion lattices
are important steps toward applications at the nanomet-
ric scale, where such spin textures are conceived.

Since the magnetic structures that we study are
marked by topological
features that describe their
skyrmion numbers, we concentrate on issues related to
the topology and stability that the localized structures
may engender. This is a topic of current interest and we
follow the lines of [16–20], which deals with the possi-
bility to control, enhance and measure the strength the
topology induces into the solutions. To do this, we fol-
low the recent work [25], in which we have studied vortex
and skyrmion properties starting from an exactly solvable
model described by a scalar ﬁeld in two spatial dimen-
sions, as introduced in [26].

We focus attention on the recent investigations [17, 18,
20], where the authors study skyrmions and discuss the
measurement [17], and splitting and enhancement [18, 20]
of such topological structures. In particular, in [17] the
authors construct interesting experimental samples, with
a vortex on top of a magnetic material, with the magnetic
material having two distinct conﬁgurations, one with the
magnetic spins pointing upward in the out-of plane di-
rection, and the other with the spins pointing downward.
They then apply external in-plane magnetic ﬁeld, which
they control and vary, and then show that as the external
ﬁeld increases, one of the skyrmions is destroyed before
the other one, indicating the strength the topology plays
in the magnetic structures. However, we think that the
skyrmions created in [17] are in fact vortices of a speciﬁc
magnetic material (they used Co circular disk) which sit

on top of another material (they used Ni ﬁlm, grown epi-
taxially on a Cu(001) substrate) with the Ni spins point-
ing up and down in the out-of-plane direction, and the
eﬀect measured shows how the up and down out-of-plane
magnetic contributions of the Ni ﬁlm change the topolog-
ical strength of the vortex structure which sits on top of
it.

In refs. [18, 20] the authors investigate several issues,
among them the two-peak appearance in the topological
charge density, which is correlated with the presence of
a large transition region, representing the internal struc-
ture of the topological skyrmion. This is another issue
that we study in this work, with the investigation of a
model which appeared before in [26]. The motivation
here is that in the one-dimensional case studied in [26],
one found a domain wall similar to the magnetic do-
main wall that appeared experimentally in Fe20Ni80 thin
ﬁlm, in a constrained geometry [27]. As we are going to
show, the model can be used to map skyrmion with unit
skyrmion number, but with the number density having
a two-peak formation, correlated with the presence of a
large transition region, the internal structure of the mag-
netic structure. In the current work, the eﬀect is related
to the fractional self-interactions that describe the model,
and in Ref. [20] it is supposed to appear in consequence
of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We recall that the
Rashba spin-orbit coupling has been studied in several
works, in particular in the experimental and theoretical
contexts in Refs. [28–32].

With these motivations in mind, in the current work we
describe how to construct theoretically, structures hav-
ing skyrmion number 1, 1/2, and 0, and we show that
they all crucially depend on speciﬁc physical properties
of the material under investigation, so they have to be
generated by speciﬁc materials, each one with its spe-
ciﬁc features. This leads us to suggest that the presence
of a magnetic vortex on top of an out-of-plane aligned
spin arrangement of another magnetic material is still a
vortex, with skyrmion number 1/2. It may be a hybrid
structure, and to describe our point of view, we organize
the work as follows. In the next section we introduce the
general framework, and we brieﬂy review the construc-
tion of skyrmions with topological numbers 1 and 1/2,

and then we introduce a new model, which may induce
splitting of the localized structure. We go on and con-
struct other localized structures with vanishing skyrmion
number in Sec. III. We then study in Sec. IV, the stability
of the localized solutions that we have presented above.
In Sec. V we use the topological charge density to show
how it behaves for the several distinct structures con-
structed in Secs. II and III, and in Sec. VI we deal with
the topology of these localized structures. We end the
work in Sec. VII, where we include our comments and
conclusions.

II. FRAMEWORK

We start reviewing the main results of the work [25]
on the subject. We suppose that the magnetic material
is homogeneous along the ˆz direction, such that the mag-
netization M is a vector with unit modulus that depends
only on the planar coordinates, such that M = M(x, y)
and M · M = 1.

To describe skyrmions, we use the magnetization M
and introduce the skyrmion number, which is a conserved
topological quantity, deﬁned by

dx dy M · ∂xM × ∂yM.

(1)

(cid:90) ∞

−∞

Q =

4π

In this work we concentrate on planar systems, and we
focus in the case of helical excitations, with M = M(r),
which only depends on the radial coordinate but is or-
thogonal to the radial direction, that is, M · ˆr = 0, in
cylindrical coordinates. We then write the magnetiza-
tion as

M(r) = ˆθ cos Θ(r) + ˆz sin Θ(r),

(2)

where Θ(r) is the single degree of freedom which we use
to describe the magnetic excitations. We can use this
magnetization to see that the skyrmion number is given
by, after changing variables from (x, y) to (r, θ),

Q = − 1
2

sin Θ(∞) +

2

sin Θ(0).

(3)

The topological proﬁle of the solution Θ(r) is then related
to its value at the origin, and the asymptotic behavior for
larger and larger values of r.

To model skyrmion solutions analytically, we take ad-

vantage of the recent study [25] and consider

The Lagrange density L that controls the scalar ﬁeld φ
has the form

∇φ · ∇φ − U (φ),

L =

1
2

˙φ2 − 1
2

(5)
where dot represents time derivative, and ∇ is the planar
gradient. We search for time independent and spherically
symmetric conﬁguration, φ = φ(r), and consider U =
U (r, φ) in the form

U (r, φ) =

1
2r2 P (φ),

(6)

with P (φ) an even polynomial, which is supposed to con-
tain non gradient terms in φ.

An important motivation to take (5) and (6) to de-
scribe the scalar degree of freedom is that it provides an-
alytical solutions that can be used to improve our under-
standing on the topological behavior of such structures.
Another motivation comes from the fact that in the one-
dimensional case studied before in [26] with a potential
dependent on an odd-integer parameter (which we shall
further explore below), one found a domain wall behav-
ior that nicely describes the magnetic domain wall that
appeared experimentally in a Fe20Ni80 thin ﬁlm element,
in constrained geometries at the nanometric scale [27].

We then go on and use (5) and (6), to get the ﬁeld

equation

We note from the above discussion that we have a spe-
ciﬁc model when we specify the polynomial P (φ). So,
we follow as in the Landau expansion for non gradient
contributions, to suggest and describe distinct models
using diﬀerent expansions for P (φ). This allows that we
describe topological and non topological structures, and
we illustrate the general situation with diﬀerent models,
which we investigate below.

Θ(r) =

φ(r) + δ,

A. Skyrmion

where δ is a constant phase, which we use to control the
magnetization at the center of the magnetic structure,
determined by r = 0. Also, we suppose that the scalar
ﬁeld φ is homogeneous and dimensionless quantity which
is described by the planar system investigated in [26].

Let us start considering a skyrmion with skyrmion
number Q = 1. This case is described by the model
with polynomial P (φ) given by

P (φ) =

1

(1 − s)2 (1 − φ2)2,

(10)

depicted for s = 0.6 and for s = 0.8, with dashed/blue and
solid/red lines, respectively.

p = 3, depicted for s = 0.6 and for s = 0.8, with dashed/blue

FIG. 4: (Color online) The solution φ(r) for the model (20) for
p = 5, depicted for s = 0.6 and for s = 0.8, with dashed/blue
and solid/red lines, respectively.

where s is a real parameter, s ∈ [0, 1), which we use
to help us to describe the model. We see here that the
quadratic term has a negative sign, and the quartic term
is positive, giving rise to spontaneous symmetry break-
ing, which is in general required for the presence of topo-
logical structure. To see how this works, we write the
equation of motion as

r2 d2φ

dr2 + r

dφ
dr

+

2φ(1 − φ2)
(1 − s)2 = 0,

(11)

(12)

which can be solved analytically to give

φs(r) =

1 − r2/(1−s)
1 + r2/(1−s)

.

There is another solution, with the minus sign, which
behaves similarly. The solution (12) is depicted in Fig. 1
for two distinct values of s, for s = 0.6 and s = 0.8, and
we see that the scalar ﬁeld varies smoothy from 1 to −1
as r increases in the interval [0,∞). We note that the
solution is sharper for the larger value of s. In fact, we
have investigated the solution for several values of s, and
we depicted the cases for s = 0.6 and 0.8 to illustrate
the general behavior; we shall follow this to depict the
ﬁgures for s = 0.6 and for s = 0.8, until Fig. 12.
The corresponding energy density is given by

ρs(r) =

16r2(1+s)/(1−s)

(1 − s)2(1 + r2/(1−s))4

,

(13)

and the total energy is

E =

8π

3(1 − s)

.

(14)

This model was investigated before in [25]. We take
it as an example of a skyrmion with skyrmion number
Q = 1. To see this, we note that the solution (12) is such
that φ(0) = 1, and φ(∞) = −1. These are the boundary
conditions we have used to write such solution, inspired
from the behavior of the polynomial (10), which has min-
ima values at φ = ±1. These two values describe the two
degenerate zero energy conﬁgurations the system engen-
ders. In this way, the ﬁnite energy topological structure
which is described by the solution (12) allows that we
describe a skyrmion, with the magnetization as in (2)
and (4). We then take δ = 0 to get that M(0) = ˆz, and
M(∞) = −ˆz. With this, we then get that Q = 1, so we
have a skyrmion with skyrmion number 1.

B. Vortex

Let us now consider another model, with the polyno-
mial having up to the sixth-order power in the ﬁeld. We
take

P (φ) =

1

(1 − s)2 φ2(1 − φ2)2.

FIG. 5: (Color online) The solution φ(r) for the model (28)
with n = 1, depicted for s = 0.6 and for s = 0.8, with
dashed/blue and solid/red lines, respectively.

FIG. 6: (Color online) The solution φ(r) for the model (28)
with n = 2, depicted for s = 0.6 and for s = 0.8, with
dashed/blue and solid/red lines, respectively.

In this case, the quadratic term is positive, the quartic
is negative, and the next one is positive, of the sixth-
order power in the ﬁeld. As in the previous case, it gives
rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking, but now it also
supports a symmetric phase at the origin. To see how
this works, we write the equation of motion as

r2 d2φ

dr2 + r

dφ
dr

− φ(1 − φ2)2
(1 − s)2 +

2φ3(1 − φ2)
(1 − s)2 = 0,

(16)

from a model introduced in [26], and we introduce the
polynomial

Pp(φ) =

p2

(1 − s)2 φ2(φ−1/p − φ1/p)2,

(20)

where p = 1, 3, 5,··· , is odd integer. We see that for
p = 1 it gets back to the ﬁrst model, given by (10). In
the general case, the equation of motion has the form

and the solution is

φs(r) =

√

r1/(1−s)
1 + r2/(1−s)

.

(17)

It is depicted in Fig. 2 for two distinct values of s, and
here we also note that the solution is sharper for the
larger value of s. The energy density has the form

ρs(r) =

r2/(1−s)

(1 − s)2(1 + r2/(1−s))3

,

(18)

and the total energy is given by

and the energy is

This model was also studied in [25], and it represents a
vortex, or a skyrmion with skyrmion number 1/2, as we
now explain. We note that the solution (17) is such that
φ(0) = 0 and φ(∞) = 1. This is similar to the previous
case, and so we follow the same steps, using (2) and (4)
and taking δ = π/2, to see that the magnetization obeys
M(0) = ˆz, and M(∞) = ˆθ. We use this to get that
Q = 1/2, so we have a vortex, a skyrmion with skyrmion
number 1/2.

III. NEW STRUCTURES

We search for other models, which present topologi-
cal proﬁle with skyrmion number 1. We get inspiration

Ep =

8πp2

(4p2 − 1)(1 − s)

.

We deﬁne the (dimensionless) ratio εp = Ep/E1 to get

εp =

3p2

(4p2 − 1)

,

(25)

which does not depend on s, and decreases from 1 to 0.75
as p increases to larger and larger odd integers. We say
that the energy decreases slowly as p increases to larger
values, and we illustrate this in the Table 1 below, where
we depict εp for several values of p.

This model is new, and we depict the solution for p =
3 in Fig. 3, for two distinct values of s. We see from
Fig. 3 that the solution is diﬀerent from the previous

01015

describe a localized excitation with zero skyrmion num-
ber, as it is suggested in Ref. [17]. To achieve this goal,
we have to introduce a polynomial P (φ) which engenders
a single zero-energy minimum, with nonzero values of φ
that make the polynomial vanish. We do this with the
choice

Pn(φ) =

1

n2(1 − s)2 φ2(1 − φ2n),

(28)

where n = 1, 2, 3,··· . This is motivated by Ref. [33], and
we see that φ = 0 is a zero and a minimum of the poly-
nomial. We also note that there are two other points,
φ = ±1, which are zeros of the polynomial. We see
that the quadratic term is positive, but the other term
is negative, such that the spontaneous symmetry break-
ing phenomenon cannot take place anymore. To see how
the system works in this case, we write the equation of
motion as

r2 d2φ

dr2 + r

dφ
dr

− φ(1 − (1 + n)φ2n)

n2(1 − s)2

= 0,

(29)

and search for solution with the boundary conditions
φ(0) = 0 and φ(∞) = 0, to make the solution non topo-
logical. Guided by this, we found the analytical solution

it
one, depicted in Fig. 1, which correspond to p = 1:
has a kind of internal structure when the ﬁeld φ changes
sign. This is similar to the behavior found before for
magnetic domain walls in constrained geometries, at the
nanometric scale [27]. We also depict the solution for
p = 5 in Fig. 4, noting that the internal structure is
now wider then it appears for p = 3. We note that the
thickness of the internal structure depends on p, and it
increases as we increase p. Thus, the energy of the ﬁeld
conﬁguration decreases as one increases the thickness of
the internal structure or the transition region.
We see that the solution (22) obeys φ(0) = 1 and
φ(∞) = −1, if p is an odd integer, so it can be used
to describe a topological structure with unit skyrmion
number. To see this, we use (2) and (4) and take δ = 0
to get M(0) = ˆz and M(∞) = −ˆz. This leads to the
topological charge Q = 1. Thus, it can be used to rep-
resent a skyrmion with skyrmion number Q = 1, for p
odd integer. We conclude that although the topological
charge does not depend on p, the thickness of the inter-
nal structure increases and the energy decreases as one
increases p.

To investigate the size of the topological skyrmions, we

follow [25] and use the mean matter radius

¯r =

(cid:82) ∞

We use it to deﬁne the (dimensionlees) ratio Rp,s =
¯rp/¯r1. It has the form

.

(26)

The corresponding energy density has the form

ρn(r) =

(2r1/(1−s))2/n(1 − r2/(1−s))2

n2(1 − s)2r2(1 + r2/(1−s))2(n+1)/n

,

and the total energy is given by

Rp,s =

0 ρp(r)r2dr
0 ρ1(r)r2dr

0 ρ1(r)rdr
0 ρp(r)rdr

(27)

En =

π3/2Γ(1/n)

n2(1 − s)Γ((3n + 2)/2n)

,

We investigate Rp,s for the model (20), but it depends on
p and s, and leads to awkward expressions; however, we
have seen that it increases with p for several values of s,
but its variation is less expressive for higher values of s.
We illustrate this in the table II below, for several values
of s. We note that as p increases, the size increases and
the energy decreases.

We now search for the possibility to construct a struc-
ture with non topological proﬁle. The issue here is to

where Γ(ξ) is gamma function. As before, we introduce
the ratio Rn = En/E1, which has the form

Rn =

Γ(1/n)Γ(5/2)

n2Γ(1)Γ((3n + 2)/2n)

.

(33)

It varies from 1 to smaller and smaller values, as n in-
creases to larger and larger values.

The solution for n = 1 is depicted in Fig. 5 for two
distinct values of s, and we also note that the solution is
sharper for the larger value of s. The solutions for n = 2
is depicted in Fig. 6, and is similar to the case n = 1.
We now use (2) and (4) and take δ = π/2 to make
the magnetization to obey M(0) = ˆz, and also, M(∞) =
ˆz. The choice makes the skyrmion number to vanish,
so we are dealing with non topological structures, with
Q = 0. This is a concrete realization of non topological
structures.

IV. LINEAR STABILITY

For the model (15), we get the zero mode

Let us now study stability of the solutions we have
found, against spherically symmetric deformations, using
that φ = φs(r) +  ηs(r), with  being very small real and
constant parameter [25]. We expand the total energy (8)
in terms of  in (9) in the form

E = E0 + E1 + 2E2 + ···

(34)

where Ei, i = 0, 1, 2, ... is the contribution to the energy
at order i in . For the model (10), Ei goes up to 4, for
the model (15), up to 6; and so on. Of course, E0 is the
energy of the solution φs(r), and E1 must be zero. For
the model (10), the zero mode has the form

η(r) = As

r2/(1−s)

(1 + r2/(1−s))2

,

(35)

where As is normalization constant. We can prove that
E2 = 0, E3 = 0, and E4 has the form

E4 =

3π

35(1 − s)

.

(36)

We see that it is positive, E4 > 0, which shows that the
solution φs(r) given by (12) is stable against spherically
symmetric ﬂuctuations.

ηs(r) = As

r2/(1−s)

(1 + r2/(1−s))3/2

,

(37)

where As is normalization constant. We can show that
E2 = 0 and

E3 =

15π2

64(1 − s)

.

(38)

We see that it is positive, E3 > 0, and this shows that
the spherically symmetric solution (17) is stable against
spherically symmetric ﬂuctuations.

For the model (20), we get the zero mode
r2/(1−s)(1 − r2/(1−s))p−1

ηp
s (r) = Ap

trolled by the two parameters p and s, and the results
show that E2 = 0, E3 = 0, and

solution is stable against spherically symmetric ﬂuctua-
tions.

distinct non topological solutions; they have vanishing
skyrmion number and are unstable against small radial
ﬂuctuations. The results illustrate that the topological
structures are protected by topology, while the non topo-
logical ones are not protected by topology.

V. TOPOLOGICAL CHARGE DENSITY

Let us now deal with the topological behavior of the
several distinct solutions we have described in the previ-
ous sections. We use the topological charge (1) to deﬁne
the topological charge density or the skyrmion number
density as follows: we write the topological charge in the

It is negative for n = 1, 2,··· and for s ∈ [0, 1), and
this proves that the spherically symmetric solutions are
unstable against spherically symmetric ﬂuctuations. The
non topological structures are neither protected by topol-
ogy nor against spherically symmetric ﬂuctuations.

We see from the above results, that we have obtained
several distinct topological skyrmions, with skyrmion
number 1, and a topological vortex, with skyrmion num-
ber 1/2. The skyrmions and vortex are stable against
small radial ﬂuctuations. We have also found several

the case with p = 5, for two values of s. The two ﬁg-
ures show very clearly the presence of the two-peak pro-
ﬁle in the skyrmion number density, and this is diﬀerent
from the two previous cases. In the models that describe
skyrmions with skyrmion number Q = 1, in the ﬁrst
model, the skyrmion number density has a single peak,
while the others have the two-peak proﬁle. This behav-
ior shows that the skyrmions for p = 3, 5,··· , are diﬀer-
ent, and we further comment on this in the next section,
where we deal with the topology of the above solutions.

We depict in Fig. 11 the case with n = 1, and in Fig. 12
the case with n = 2, for two distinct values of s. We see
that the skyrmion number densities of the non topologi-
cal structures are similar to each other, but they are well
diﬀerent from the behavior presented by the topological
structures. They change sign as r increases to larger val-
ues, and this is required to make the topological charge
vanish.

VI. TOPOLOGY

In order to highlight the internal structure or transition
region that appears in the skyrmions with skyrmion num-
ber Q = 1 that we constructed above, we follow [18, 20]
and use a continuum of colors, taking red to represent
the magnetization pointing downward in the ˆz direction,
yellow for the magnetization vanishing along the ˆz direc-
tion, and blue for the magnetization pointing upward in
the ˆz direction. We depict these magnetic structures in
ﬁgures 13, for p = 1, 3, 5, 7 and for s = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8,
to illustrate how the skyrmion changes as we vary p and
s. These proﬁles follow the solutions themselves, and we
note that the larger the value of s is, the sharper the
solution becomes.

We note from Fig. 13 that the skyrmions of the models
with p = 3, 5, 7 have larger and larger transition regions,
depicted in yellow, when compared to the skyrmion of
the ﬁrst model, with p = 1. This behavior is similar
to the eﬀect investigated before in [20], where a larger
transition region has been identiﬁed, correlated with the
two-peak proﬁle which appeared in the skyrmion num-
ber density there studied. The eﬀect seen in [20] is due
to the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In the current work
we are using another route, proposed in [25], and here
we could also map internal or transition regions, adding

skyrmion number 1, which is controlled by the model (20),

fractional power to the scalar ﬁeld. It is interesting to re-
mark that scalar ﬁeld with such fractional power was ﬁrst
suggested in [26], and in the one-dimensional case the do-
main wall it generates correctly maps structures found in
[27], in the magnetic material Fe20Ni80 in constrained ge-
ometries. The results suggest that the current procedure
is of direct interest to the subject, since it provides an
analytical route to describe skyrmion features, capable
of inducing internal structure to such spin textures.

The procedure is general, and it is also capable of
describing vortices, with skyrmion number Q = 1/2,
and non topological structures, with vanishing skyrmion
number. In Fig. 14 we illustrate the vortex of the model
(15), and in Fig. 15 the case of vanishing skyrmion num-
ber of the model (28) for n = 1; the colors follow the
pattern used in Fig. 13. The two ﬁgures show that the
solutions are sharper for larger values of s, as it also ap-
peared in the previous cases.

The several solutions constructed in Secs. II and III
have distinct proﬁles, which appear from the diﬀerent
ways the polynomials are constructed, and this is deeply
connected to the physical behavior of the models. As we
see, in the model (10) that supports skyrmion with unit
skyrmion number, for instance, the φ2 term is negative,
and requires that we add the φ4 term with positive sign,
to stabilize the model. This positive sign means that the
fourth-order self-interactions are attractive and stabilize
the system. In the second model, which supports vortex

with half-integer skyrmion number, we have changed the
signs of both the φ2 and φ4 terms, but we added a φ6
term, attractive, which works to stabilize the new model.
In the next model, although the φ2 is positive, there are
other fractional powers in the ﬁeld, and this makes the
model well diﬀerent from the two previous ones. In the
last model, the φ2 term is positive but the term with
φ2n+2 is negative, so it makes the self-interactions repul-
sive and contributes to make the non topological struc-
ture unstable.

Another interesting result shows that the physical
properties of the system are mandatory to describe the
behavior of the topological or non topological structure.
With this in mind, we note that in the work [17], two dis-
tinct scenarios are built, with similar vortex structures
with skyrmion number 1/2: one, with a vortex on top
of a magnetic material with the magnetization pointing
downward, and the other, with a similar vortex on top
of the same material, but now with the magnetization
pointing upward. Since the magnetization at the center
of the two vortices points upward, it seems that the vor-
tex of the ﬁrst arrangement is a topological structure with
skyrmion number 1, similar to the structure we have con-
structed from the model (10), and also, that the vortex
of the second arrangement is a non topological structure,
similar to the structures we have constructed from the
model (28). They then apply an in-plane magnetic ﬁeld,
which they increases until the vortex is destroyed.

The experimental data show that the vortex of the ﬁrst
arrangement, which appears to be a topological structure
with skyrmion number 1, is destroyed after the second,
requiring a magnetic ﬁeld which is stronger then the mag-
netic ﬁeld necessary to destroy the vortex of the second
arrangement. The authors suggest that the topology is
playing its game, making the topological structure harder
to be destroyed. However, from the above results we be-
lieve that another interpretation is possible, because they

are using vortex on top of the background material, and
that makes the two solutions hybrid conﬁgurations, and
not genuine skyrmions, as the ones constructed in this
work.
In particular, we note that the non topological
structure is unstable, and could not survive the presence
of the external, in-plane magnetic ﬁeld. We believe that
it is the background out-of-plane magnetic ﬁeld that ap-
pears from the magnetic material where the vortex stands
that acts distinctly, making the vortex in the ﬁrst ar-
rangement more stable then the other.

To decide on this, we would suggest to modify the back-
ground material, letting it be an inert material, support-
ing no net spin arrangement. With this, we repeat the
experiment, but now with the vortex on top of the in-
ert material. We think that the vortex will be destroyed
with an in-plane magnetic ﬁeld with value in between the
two values obtained in Ref. [17]. If this is true, we are
then measuring how the out-of-plane magnetic ﬁeld of the
background material contributes to weaken or strengthen
the topological structure. The result would allow that we
manipulate the topology of vortex, an issue which is of
current interest to taylor such nanometric spin textures.
Evidently, the suggestion requires further dedicated in-
vestigations, similar to the one presented in [17], but this
is outside the scope of the current work.

Another suggestion we could make is to prepare an-
other experiment, similar to the one done in [17], but
now using skyrmions with distinct but larger transition
regions, on top of some inert background material. We
then turn on and increase the in-plane magnetic ﬁeld, to
measure the topology strength as a function of the width
of the transition region. This would bring further light
on the topological strength of magnetic skyrmions, with
distinct internal structures.

VII. COMMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work we studied the topological behavior of
localized magnetic structures with skyrmion number 1,
1/2, and 0. They appear from distinct models, with at-
tractive and/or repulsive self-interactions. The two ﬁrst
cases, with skyrmion number 1 and 1/2 were studied be-
fore in [25], the third one, with unit skyrmion number
and the two case of vanishing skyrmion number are new
and appear here for the ﬁrst time. The several cases of
non vanishing skyrmion number are protected by topol-
ogy, and are stable against radial ﬂuctuations, but the
cases of zero skyrmion numbers which are non topologi-
cal, are linearly unstable, as we investigated explicitly in
this work.

As shown in the investigation, the several distinct
structures appear from diﬀerent models, and are con-
trolled by speciﬁc self-interactions, which are directly
connected with the physical behavior of the models
that support the localized structures. For instance, the
topological structure with unit skyrmion number that
appeared from model (10) is formed under the pres-
ence of attractive quartic self-interactions, while the non
topological structures with vanishing skyrmion numbers

10

that appeared from model (28) require repulsive self-
interactions of the φ2n+2 (n = 1, 2,··· ) type. The topo-
logical structures are stable against radially symmetric
ﬂuctuations, and the non topological structures are un-
stable.

An interesting feature of the present study is that it
is implemented analytically, and this help us to better
understand some important physical properties of the
spin textures that behave as topological vortices and
skyrmions, at the nanometric scale. The results of the
work motivate us to use the procedure to taylor the spin
structures, controlling the way the magnetization varies,
due to quantum [18] and other [34, 35] eﬀects. We shall
further report on this elsewhere.
