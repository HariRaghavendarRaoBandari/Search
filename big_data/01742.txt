ABSTRACT
A steepening feature in the outer density proﬁles of dark matter halos - the splashback radius -
has drawn much attention recently. A possible observational detection has even been made for
galaxy clusters. Theoretically, Adhikari et al. have estimated the location of the splashback
radius by computing the secondary infall trajectory of a dark matter shell through a growing
dark matter halo with an NFW proﬁle. However, since they imposed a shape of the halo
proﬁle rather than computing it consistently from the trajectories of the dark matter shells,
they could not provide the full shape of the dark matter proﬁle around the splashback radius.
We improve on this by extending the self-similar spherical collapse model of Fillmore &
Goldreich to a ΛCDM universe. This allows us to compute the dark matter halo proﬁle and
the trajectories simultaneously from the mass accretion history. Our results on the splashback
location agree qualitatively with Adhikari et al. but with small quantitative diﬀerences at large
mass accretion rate. We present new ﬁtting formulae for the splashback radius Rsp in various
forms, including the ratios of Rsp/R200c and Rsp/R200m. Numerical simulations have made the
puzzling discovery that the splashback radius scales well with R200m but not with R200c. We
trace the origin of this to be the correlated increase of Ωm and the average halo mass accretion
rate with an increasing redshift.

INTRODUCTION

Recent numerical simulations (Diemer & Kravtsov 2014) have
noticed a sharp steepening in the outer density proﬁles of dark mat-
ter halos, which seems to oﬀer a physical boundary of dark matter
halos (More, Diemer & Kravtsov 2015). Although this steepening
feature lies in a low density region in the outskirts of a dark mat-
ter halo and thus hard to detect, observational evidence has been
found by studying the projected number density proﬁles of galax-
ies around galaxy clusters (More et al. 2016).

Physically, this steepening feature has been identiﬁed with the
‘splashback’ of recently accreted dark matter i.e. piling up of dark
matter near the ﬁrst apocenter of its orbit through the halo (Diemer
& Kravtsov 2014). With this physical picture, Adhikari, Dalal &
Chamberlain (2014) theoretically estimated the radial position of
the splashback Rsp. They computed Rsp by tracing the trajectory of
a dark matter shell accreted onto a dark matter halo and then going
through it, and described the dark matter halo with an NFW pro-
ﬁle (Navarro, Frenk & White 1996, 1997) with its mass increasing
with time. They found good agreement of the predicted splashback
radius and the steepening position from the stacked halos in the
Diemer & Kravtsov (2014) simulations. However, one weakness
of their method is that the imposed NFW shape of the halo proﬁle

and the trajectories of the dark matter shells are not fully consistent
with each other. Although this may not aﬀect their estimation for
Rsp to a large extent, it prevents them from giving the full shape of
the dark matter proﬁle around the splashback radius.

In fact, the steepening feature at halo outskirts has been known
for long time in the self-similar spherical collapse model (Fillmore
& Goldreich 1984; Bertschinger 1985; Lithwick & Dalal 2011) as
associated with the outmost caustic. In contrast, the caustics in dark
matter halos had not been noticed in three-dimensional numeri-
cal simulations due to resolution limits until lately when special
techniques were applied (Vogelsberger et al. 2009; Hahn & Angulo
2016). As the outer proﬁles of dark matter halos are primarily de-
termined by the recent mass accretion, and the matter there has rel-
atively little participation in the relaxation processes which require
numerical simulations to capture, the self-similar spherical collapse
model is actually rather adequate in describing the outer proﬁle of
dark matter halos. Another merit of the self-similar spherical col-
lapse model is that the halo proﬁle and the trajectories of the dark
matter shells are treated consistently with iterations of computing
one from the other.

Thus we use the self-similar spherical collapse model to com-
pute the outer proﬁles of dark matter halos. One obstacle remains
still, that the self-similarity is strictly valid only in a universe with
no characteristic scales, e.g. an Einstein de-Sitter (EdS) universe
(Ωm = 1) as considered in previous studies (Fillmore & Goldreich

1984; Bertschinger 1985; Lithwick & Dalal 2011). Here we ex-
tend the model to a ΛCDM universe by relaxing the self-similarity
ansatz while keeping its feature of computing trajectories and halo
proﬁle in a consistent manner.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Sect. 2 we
describe the detailed procedures of our computation and the result-
ing mass and density proﬁles of dark matter halos. Then we derive
analytical interpretations of the results, and provide ﬁtting formu-
lae in Sect. 3, summarise our ﬁndings and conclude in Sec. 4. We
present the minimalistic dimensionless form of spherical collapse
in a ΛCDM universe in Appendix. A, which scales out the cosmol-
ogy dependence in the variables and has thus greatly reduced our
computational cost. With this form, many relations among the vari-
ables as well as the dark matter density proﬁle in the single stream
regime of spherical collapse can be expressed in simple analytical
forms, which we show in Appendices. A1 and A2. Finally, in Ap-
pendix. B we present a physical estimation of the splashback radius
in an EdS universe.

2 MASS AND DENSITY PROFILES FROM

PROFILE-TRAJECTORY ITERATION

2.1 Methods

We look for the asymptotic proﬁle of dark matter halos as a
function of their mass accretion rate and the background cosmol-
ogy. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to a ﬂat ΛCDM universe
with Ωm + ΩΛ = 1, and study the case of power law mass growth
Mvir ∝ as where a is the cosmic scale factor. Thus, the two ba-
sic parameters in our study are the mass accretion rate s and the
dimensionless matter density of the universe Ωm(a).

Power law mass growth are typical for dark matter halos in
our Universe at low redshifts (e.g. Correa et al. 2015). The typi-
cal mass growth rate is s (cid:46) 1 for galaxy mass halos today, and
increases with redshift and halo mass. Following Adhikari, Dalal
& Chamberlain (2014), we use the mass enclosed by the shell
that has collapsed to half of its turn-around radius Mhrta under no
shell-crossing as a proxy for the virial mass Mvir of the halo. This
matches the early deﬁnition of virial radius in a spherical collapse
model (Lacey & Cole 1993). With this deﬁnition, the relative sizes
of dark matter shells are speciﬁed by their dimensionless trajecto-
ries (Appendix. A) when the mass growth history is given.

In a multi-stream region such as a dark matter halo, the dark
matter trajectory depends on the halo mass proﬁle and vice versa,
thus an iteration is needed in computing the two. Under strict self-
similarity, the trajectory of one dark matter shell also represents the
locations of all dark matter shells in a snapshot, and thus within
each iteration, only one integration of orbit is needed. In a ΛCDM
universe, we lose such simpliﬁcation, and need to compute the tra-
jectories of the dark matter shells accreted at diﬀerent times si-
multaneously. To reduce this computational cost, we simplify the
spherical collapse equations to a minimalistic dimensionless form
(Appendix. A). The loss of strict self-similarity also means that the
mass proﬁle is time dependent. Luckily, in our Universe where the
dark energy is still not entirely dominating, this time dependence
is mild and slow. For the outer proﬁle of dark matter halo which
is built by matter accreted relatively recently, the halo mass proﬁle
can still be approximated as constant over the dynamical time of
this matter.

Therefore, we parametrize the mass in the multi-stream region
as M(R) = Mhrta(a) f (R/Rhrta), with an initial choice of f0(x) = x.

Figure 1. Mass proﬁle converges quickly with the number of iteration n.
The plotted mass is scaled to Mta, the mass within the turn-around radius
Rta.

Figure 2. Dependence of the halo mass proﬁle on Ωobs
m .

Then we compute the trajectories of the shells till the time the halo
is observed, which is speciﬁed by the value of Ωobs
m . Using the tra-
jectories we update the form of mass proﬁle to f1(x), compute the
trajectories again, and iterate. The mass proﬁle and trajectories con-
verge quickly with the number of iterations n (Fig. 1). As shown by
Fig. 2, the shape of the mass proﬁle scaled to Rhrta is indeed only
slightly time-dependent, even over a long time range indicated by
the change of the matter content of the universe Ωobs
m .

2.2 Results

The converged mass proﬁles, the density proﬁles derived from
them, and their dependencies on Ωobs
m and the mass accretion rate
s are shown in Fig. 3. We ﬁnd three features that characterise the
general shapes of the mass and density proﬁles: a power-law in-
ner slope, the splashback feature, and a smooth proﬁle outside the
splashback radius where the matter is still on its infall towards the
halo. The other caustics in the density proﬁles (middle column
of Fig. 3) are hardly observable after smoothing (right column of
Fig. 3) which in reality would be caused by e.g. asphericity of the
halo and instability to perturbations (Henriksen & Widrow 1999).
The power-law inner mass proﬁle M ∝ RΥ has been studied by
Fillmore & Goldreich (1984) in an EdS universe. There, the mass
accretion rate is related to the logarithmic slope  of the initial mass

This is expected since the inner proﬁles are composed primarily of
shells collapsed at early times when dark matter dominates the en-
ergy content of the universe. Admittedly, in the very inner regions
of dark matter halos, especially within the scale radius of an NFW
proﬁle, the dynamics of dark matter particles is heavily inﬂuenced

by relaxation mechanisms including the radial orbit instability (e.g.
Merritt & Aguilar 1985; MacMillan, Widrow & Henriksen 2006;
Vogelsberger, Mohayaee & White 2011), and the angular momen-
tum of the particles cannot be neglected. The one-dimensional ac-
cretion model we use naturally cannot reproduce the true dark mat-
ter proﬁles in these regions. However, as the dynamical time in the
central region is very short, the inner proﬁle should not have much
inﬂuence on the dark matter dynamics and proﬁles in the outer re-
gions.

The sharp jump in the density proﬁle at the splashback radius
is evident in all cases, and the amplitude of the density jump for
the un-smoothed density proﬁle always lies around a factor of 4
to 5. This can be understood considering that the splashback ra-
dius separates the regions with one and three dark matter streams
(Fig. 4), and that the earlier accreted matter is denser than the mat-
ter currently being accreted. What depends on the accretion rate
and the cosmology is the location of the splashback radius, as has
been discovered by previous studies (Adhikari, Dalal & Chamber-
lain 2014; Diemer & Kravtsov 2014). As shown by Fig. 3, the ratio
of the splashback radius and the turn-around radius decreases with
the accretion rate s. For low accretion rates, the ratio is approxi-
mately independent of Ωobs
m , whereas the decreasing with s at high
accretion rate is more signiﬁcant for a universe with low matter
content. We investigate the locations of the splashback radius in
more details in Sect. 3.1, where we provide explanations to these
behaviors.

Outside the splashback radius and within the turn-around ra-
dius, the matter is still on its initial infall onto the halo. The dark
matter density proﬁles in this regime (color solid lines in the middle
and right columns of Fig. 3 outside the splashback radius) represent
the correlated matter around the halo, or the so-called 2-halo term.
Instead of modeling the proﬁles in this region in an averaged sense
from the matter power spectrum, we can describe them using the
spherical collapse model to take account of the dependence on the
accretion rate of the individual halos. Indeed, the numerically inte-
grated proﬁles match well with the single-stream analytical proﬁles
(color dashed lines) given in Appendix. A2.

time of observation in an EdS universe as a function of accretion rate s.
The analytical formula given in Eq. (2) for s (cid:54) 3/2 (magenta dash line)
and s (cid:62) 3/2 (green solid line) agree well with the numerical results (blue
circles).

3 ANALYTICAL INTERPRETATIONS AND FITTING

FORMULA

3.1 The splashback radius

After turning around, dark matter shells begin to oscillate in
the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo. Approximating
the mass proﬁles by their inner power law shape, M = (R/Rta)ΥMta
with Υ given by Eq. (1), one can see that the gravitational potential
of the dark matter halo in a Eulerian coordinates grows with time
when the accretion rate s > 3/2 while stays approximately constant
when s (cid:54) 3/2.

We study the location of the splashback radius by tracing the
dynamics of the oscillating orbits in these two regimes. In an EdS
universe, approximate analytical solutions to the dynamical equa-
tion can be obtained as (Appendix. B)

which well-describes the smaller Rsp/Rta ratio at a larger accretion
rate (Fig. 5).

In a ΛCDM universe, the growth of the turn-around radius
with time is more signiﬁcant at a certain mass accretion rate com-
pared to the case of an EdS universe, due to the additional expan-
sion caused by the dark energy. This explains the smaller Rsp/Rta
ratio when Ωobs
m is smaller (Fig. 3). This eﬀect is more pronounced
for a larger mass accretion rate. In the limit of small accretion
rate s → 0, the Rsp/Rta ratio stays approximately invariant with
the change of the cosmological background. As evident in Fig. 3,
for the lowest accretion rate we sampled, s = 0.5, the position of
the splashback radius already approaches the asymptotic value of
Rsp/Rta = 3− 2

3 (cid:46) 0.5.

3.2 Time when the splashback matter was accreted

Since the actual mass accretion rate of a dark matter halo
changes with time, it is necessary to know the time when the splash-
back matter was accreted to ﬁnd the proper accretion rate in simu-
lations to compare with theory.

Regarding the orbit of a dark matter shell as an oscillation
starting from the beginning of its expansion, the turn-around hap-
pens at phase 1/4 of the ﬁrst oscillation, accretion onto the halo

happens at around phase 1/2, and splashback happens at phase
3/4. Thus, the age of the universe at which the matter currently
1 should be
at the splashback radius was accreted on to the halo tacc
close to (1/2)/(3/4) = 2/3 of the current age tsp at low accretion
rates where the halo potential is roughly constant with time. This
rough estimate is supported by the results from numerical integra-
tion shown in Figs. 4 and 6. In detail, the ratio of tacc/tsp increases
with increasing accretion rate and decreasing matter density of the
universe. This means, for example, that the splashback matter at
redshift zero in a ﬂat universe with Ωm0 = 0.3 was accreted at ap-
proximately redshift z ≈ 0.4 for an accretion rate s = 1 and z ≈ 0.2
for an accretion rate s = 5. This gives a hint on how to choose
the redshift range to average the mass accretion rate measured in
simulations for a comparison study.

3.3 Fitting formulae and comparison to previous studies

Since we have computed the halo mass proﬁle and the splash-
back location consistently, we can study the splashback location
with respect to the commonly used radii deﬁned from the halo mass
proﬁle, e.g. R200c, R200m and Rvir. Here we provide ﬁtting formulae
for the locations of the splashback radius in terms of these radii as
functions of the mass accretion rate s and the matter content of the

cal integration are shown as the stars. The lines are from ﬁtting formulae
Eqs. 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The red arrows in the upper and middle pan-
els demonstrate how the Rsp/R200c and Rsp/R200m ratios would typically
change between halo samples observed at two redshifts. That the orienta-
tion of the arrow for Rsp/R200m would typically be more horizontal explains
why Rsp scales better with R200m than R200c (see text for more details).

The locations of R200c, R200m and Rvir are determined using the mass
proﬁles, and Rsp using the outmost radius where the density di-
verges in the un-smoothed density proﬁles. The mean overdensity
within Rvir at virial radius depends on cosmology as (Bryan & Nor-
man 1998)

Figure 8. The overdensity at the splashback radius. Solid lines show ﬁtting
formula Eq. 7 to our results from numerical integration (stars). In compari-
son, the Adhikari, Dalal & Chamberlain (2014) ﬁtting formula is shown as
the dotted lines.

(see also Lacey & Cole 1993; Nakamura & Suto 1997, for other
ﬁtting formulae).
For other reference radii e.g. R500m, one can use M ∝ RΥ
with Υ given by Eq. (1) as an approximation of the outer mass
proﬁle to scale the reference radii to R200c or R200m. For example,
R500m/R200m = (500/200)1/(Υ−3). This holds approximately correct
as long as the chosen reference radius is large enough that relax-
ation physics is still sub-dominant compared to accretion.

Fig. 7 shows the numerically integrated results for the loca-
tions of the splashback radius in comparison with the ﬁtting formu-
lae. In units of R200c or R200m, the splashback radius also decreases
with increasing accretion rate s (Fig. 7), consistent with numerical
ﬁndings (Diemer & Kravtsov 2014; Lau et al. 2015) and analyti-
cal results from Adhikari, Dalal & Chamberlain (2014). We also
notice the remarkably good agreement on the accretion rate depen-
dence of Rsp/R200m between our result and the numerical result of
More, Diemer & Kravtsov (2015) (their Fig. 3), despite of the im-
perfect match between s and the accretion rate indicator measured
from simulations. The dependence on Ωobs
m diﬀers when scaled with
R200c or R200m. The ratio Rsp/R200c decreases with increasing Ωobs
m at
small accretion rate, while saturates to Rsp/R200c (cid:46) 1 at large ac-
cretion rate for all Ωobs
m values. In comparison, the ratio Rsp/R200m
increases with Ωobs

m at all accretion rates (Fig. 7).

Numerical studies (Diemer & Kravtsov 2014; Lau et al. 2015)
have found that the splashback radius of halos at diﬀerent redshifts
align much better with each other when scaled with R200m than
R200c. The origin of this intriguing property has not yet been un-
derstood. From our results (see e.g. Fig. 7), the alignment of the
splashback radius is not better with R200m than R200c at a ﬁxed ac-
cretion rate for the cosmology and redshift range considered in the
m ≈ 0.3 or greater). The apparent better alignment
simulations (Ωobs
when scaled with R200m is an outcome of correlated increase of Ωobs
m
and the average halo mass accretion rate with redshift: the decrease
of Rsp/R200m with s and the increase with Ωobs
m cancel each other
to some extent; on the other hand Rsp/R200c decreases with both
Ωobs
m and s, which leads to an inevitable decrease of Rsp/R200c with
redshift (see the red arrows in Fig. 7).

Another way of describing the location of the splashback ra-

dius is to look at the mean overdensity within it:

This ﬁtting formula (solid lines in Fig. 8) to our results agrees well
with that given in Adhikari, Dalal & Chamberlain (2014) (dotted
lines) in the limit of small accretion rates. When the accretion rate is
large, our results yield larger ∆sp
m . The diﬀer-
ence arises from the diﬀerent treatment of the halo density proﬁles.
Instead of using a mass proﬁle derived consistently from the tra-
jectories of the dark matter shells, Adhikari, Dalal & Chamberlain
(2014) connects the single-stream region to an NFW halo proﬁle
at half of the turn-around radius, and determines the concentration
of the halo from the accretion rate by matching the proﬁle slopes
in the two regions at that radius. The halo concentration parameter
they derive decreases fast with an increasing mass accretion rate. It
has very small values c < 3 already at a relatively mild mass ac-
cretion rate s > 1.25, leading to a large dark matter core which has
less mass compared to our self-similar mass proﬁle. Our rsp(Ωobs
m , s)
relation can be reproduced with their method using a higher value
for the concentration parameter c ≈ 8. Nevertheless, the current
agreement between the two approaches is suﬃciently good if one
disregards the region with low Ωobs
m and high accretion rate in the
parameter space, which can hardly be reached in reality. Also, given
the fact that ∆m is a steep function of radius (with a typical power-
law slope of -2 to -3), the diﬀerence in terms of the predicted Rsp
would be even smaller.

4 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Being dominated by recent accretions rather than by relax-
ation processes, the outer proﬁle of dark matter halos can be reason-
ably well-described by one dimensional spherical collapse models.
The challenge, however, is to consistently treat the trajectories of
dark matter shells and the mass proﬁle of dark matter halos in a
ΛCDM universe.

We achieved this by generalising the self-similar spherical col-
lapse model of Fillmore & Goldreich (1984) to a ΛCDM universe.
To remedy the loss of strict self-similarity, we simultaneously com-
puted the trajectories of dark matter shells that collapsed at diﬀerent
cosmic times using a simple dimensionless form of the spherical
collapse model which reduced the computational eﬀort.

The resulting dark matter proﬁles depend on two parameters:
the mass accretion rate of the dark matter halo, and the matter con-
tent of the universe (and thus the redshift). We ﬁnd that the shape
of dark matter proﬁles are clearly separated into an inner power
law proﬁle whose slope depends on the mass accretion rate but not
on the redshift, and an accretion region where the proﬁles depend
on both, but can be described easily by the spherical collapse of a
single shell to a good approximation. These inner and accretion re-
gions are linked by a sharp transiting region around the splashback
radius, where the dark matter density drops abruptly by a factor of
∼ 4 − 5.

We conﬁrmed, and provided more understanding to previous
results on how the splashback radius depends on the accretion rate
and the redshift. In particular, the puzzling numerical discovery that
the splashback radius Rsp scales well with R200m rather than with the
more frequently used R200c is found to be an outcome of correlated
increase of Ωobs
m and the average halo mass accretion rate with red-
shift and their canceling eﬀects on Rsp/R200m.

APPENDIX A: MINIMALISTIC DIMENSIONLESS FORM
OF SPHERICAL COLLAPSE IN A ΩM + ΩΛ = 1 UNIVERSE
We consider the nonlinear evolution of a spherical region with
overdensity δ(Ri). The evolution of radius R of the shell encom-
passing mass M shares the same dynamical equation with the back-
ground universe (e.g. Mo, van den Bosch & White 2010)

Here, Λ is the cosmological constant, Mi is the initial mass encom-
passed by the shell, and Ri = R(ai)/ai is the comoving size of the
shell at the initial time when the cosmic scale factor a = ai. Since
the density ﬂuctuations are small in the early universe, δ(Ri) (cid:28) 1,
the mass of the overdense region is Mi = 4π¯ρ0R3
i /3 to a good ap-
proximation, with ¯ρ being the mean matter density of the universe,
and subscript ‘0’ indicates today (a = 1).

Compared to the background universe with K = 0, the shell
expands more slowly. A shell encompassing a large overdensity ﬁ-
nally turns around at a radius Rta and starts to infall towards the
center (see trajectories of the shells as dashed lines in Fig. A1).
Shell-crossing happens after this turn-around and the energy equa-
tion (A2) is no longer valid.

Even before turn-around, the dynamical behavior of the shell

is determined by three parameters:

• the mass / size of the overdense region
• its overdensity with respect to the mean matter density, which
determines the curvature of the overdense region when the latter is
viewed as a separate universe (e.g. Ichiki & Takada 2012)
• the value of the cosmological constant which sets a a typical

time scale in the evolution of the universe.

We shall reduce the number of parameters to gain general quantita-
tive properties of the spherical collapse. Eke, Cole & Frenk (1996)
have presented a dimensionless form of the spherical collapse equa-
tions with two parameters: scaled Λ and K deﬁned as (see Table. A

Table A1. Summary of the notations for the variables describing the back-
ground cosmology (the ﬁrst three rows) and the spherical overdense region
(the last three rows), both in their original and scaled forms. In the scaled
forms, the dimensional physical scales deﬁned by the mass of the initial
overdense region Mi, its comoving radius Ri = R(ai)/ai and the mean over-
density of the universe at redshift zero ρ0 are taken out of the cosmological
constant, time, the curvature and the radius of the overdense region; and
the cosmology as described by the scaled cosmological constant is taken
out of the cosmic scale factor, time, the overdensity and the radius of the
overdense region.

They also showed that, in a universe with a non-zero cosmological
constant (w > 0), a minimum initial overdensity which corresponds
to κmin = 3w1/3/22/3 is required for a shell to collapse.

We use this to deﬁne a new parameter β := κ/κmin to describe
the overdensity of the shell. At the same time, we further scale out
the cosmology (‘w’) dependencies in the radius and time variables:

The trajectories of the shells in the absence of shell-crossing
until they reach half of their turn-around radius (‘hrta’) are shown
in Fig. A1. Now, a shell is characterised solely by its scaled over-
density β. The physical scale of the shell is only important in the

shell-crossing region. Cosmology dependence is removed from the
dynamical and energy equations. Diﬀerent cosmologies correspond
to diﬀerent values of u0 and I0, or uobs and Iobs in a more general
sense when we label a universe with its Ωobs
m value at the time of
observation irrespective of the corresponding redshift. In particu-
lar, an EdS universe corresponds to uobs (cid:28) 1 and Iobs (cid:28) 1, and
the shells collapsed before this time must have β (cid:29) 1 (Fig. A1). A
ΛCDM universe with Ωm = 0.3 has uobs = (0.3−1 − 1)1/3 ≈ 1.326.
Due to the simple form of the scaled spherical collapse equa-
tion in the single-stream regime (Eq. A8), useful analytical re-
lations can be derived among the variables (see Appendix. A1).
These relations also enable easy determination of initial conditions
for the numerical integration of the dynamical equation in the shell-
crossing regime.

From the scaled spherical collapse equation Eq. (A8), we can
derive an analytical expression for the scaled turn-around radius y∗

truncation radius beyond which matter can no longer fall onto them
(cf. Subramanian, Cen & Ostriker 2000).

Until turn-around, the relation between time and radius is

A2 Dark matter density proﬁle in the single-stream region

With the dynamics of infall described by Eq. (A8), the dark
matter density proﬁle in the single-stream region is fully speciﬁed
when the physical scales of the dark matter shells are given, e.g., by
the mass accretion rate of the central halo. Labeling the dark matter
shells by their overdensity parameter β, the density at the location
of the shell at epoch u is

APPENDIX B: SPLASHBACK RADIUS IN AN EDS
UNIVERSE

As shown by Fillmore & Goldreich (1984), in an EdS uni-
verse, for a small accretion rate s (cid:54) 3/2, the gravitational potential
is static; for s (cid:62) 3/2, the potential grows, the orbit contracts, and
the amplitude of oscillation decays with time. Namely, since the
turn-around radius and the mass enclosed grow in an EdS universe
as Rta(I)/R∗ = (I/I∗)2/3+2s/9 and Mta(t)/M∗ = (I/I∗)2s/3 (Fillmore &

For time-independent gravitational potentials (when s (cid:54) 3/2),
Eq. (B2) does not have explicit time-dependence, and represents an

Isp ≈ 3I∗, and the Rsp/Rta ratio reﬂects only the growth of the
turnaround radius with time,

For time-dependent gravitational potentials (when s > 3/2),
some conserved quantity is usually exploited to describe the am-
plitude and period change in the oscillator. In the limit of slow
mass accretion, the radial action of the orbit is conserved (Binney
& Tremaine 2008) even when the gravitational potential grows with
time. More generally, a canonical transformation of coordinates can
be constructed that removes the explicit time-dependence from the
Hamiltonian of the oscillating shell (Pe˜narrubia 2013). In our case
of time varying power-law potentials with mass proﬁle slope of
Υ = 1 (Eq. 1), the transformation is approximately R(cid:48) = (I/I∗)α/2R
and dτ = (I/I∗)αdI. To linear order, the dynamical equation ex-

Thus, in summary, we have obtained two analytical approxi-
mations for the value of Rsp/Rta in an EdS universe as a function
of the accretion rate s (Eqs. B3 and B9) suited for s (cid:54) 3/2 and
s (cid:62) 3/2 respectively. As shown by Fig. 5, they describe the numer-
ically integrated values rather well for the tested range of s (cid:54) 5. In
the limit of extremely high accretion rates, however, even the sec-
ond approximation (Eq. B9) will fail from neglecting the non-linear
corrections in the coordinate transformations.
