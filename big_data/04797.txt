We study the cosmological evolution with nonsingular branes generated by a bulk scalar

ﬁeld coupled to gravity. The speciﬁc setup investigated leads to branes with a time-dependent

warp factor. We calculate the eﬀective Hubble parameter and the eﬀective scale factor for

the FRW branes obtained solutions. The spatially dependent branes solutions also were

found.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Braneworld models were introduced as a genuine branch of research in high energy physics

since the outstanding works presented in Refs.

[1–3]. After those works, several authors tried

to construct models compatible with the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology.

In fact, the

modeling of realistic braneworld scenarios from the large scale physics point of view must include, at

least in some level, the description encoded in the cosmological standard model. The attempts put

forward to this program can be roughly separated into two categories: one dealing with inﬁnitely

thin branes, in which the extra dimensional eﬀects enters as corrections to the Einstein equations

via the presence of the Weyl tensor (the so-called ‘dark ﬂuid’) and quadratic contributions to the

stress tensor, and another one, whose modeling arrive at thick branes described by one or more

bulk scalar ﬁelds. In the former approach, the corrections to the gravitational equations comes

from the Gauss-Codazzi procedure and, potentially, all the relevant aspects of the four-dimensional

cosmology are revisited. It turns out, however, that an inﬁnitely thin brane seems to be only an

approximation of the more realistic case, at best. In fact, by keeping in mind the simple fact that

at very short scales a classic gravitational theory must be replaced by its quantum counterpart

(whatever it is), it is mandatory some thickness to the brane itself.

Unfortunately, in the thick brane context it is not possible, at the best of our knowledge, to

apply the Gauss-Codazzi formalism. The reason is that it is not clear what (if any) are the Israel-

Darmois junction conditions in a thick brane context. The junction conditions are at the heart

of the projection procedure, and its lack makes the whole program fall apart. In this vein, the

investigation of a ﬁve-dimensional thick braneworld setup whose four-dimensional part describes a

Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe is, indeed, in order. There are, nevertheless, only a

few works addressing this crucial point. The cumbersome algebraic task inevitably present in this

endeavor can be attributed as a cause for such.

In this paper we address ourselves to this task, starting from a ﬁve dimensional scalar ﬁeld

whose solution describes a FRW brane, i. e., a braneworld whose four-dimensional part is given by

a FRW universe. The main braneworld characteristic, the warp factor, is also take into account in

the solution.

We organize this paper as follows.

In Section II, we present the mathematical preliminaries

supporting the metric ansatz with the four-dimensional background metric given by the Friedmann-

Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker. Then we derive gravitational equations and the expressions for the

scalar ﬁeld and its potential.

In Section III, we ﬁnd the time-dependent FRW brane solutions.

We solve the ﬁeld equations for two cases with respect to spatial curvature, i.e, k = 0 and k 6= 0.
Going further we determine the spatial part of the set of equations in Section IV. In Section V we

present the eﬀective Hubble parameter as well as the eﬀective scale factor for all the possibilities

found previously. In the ﬁnal section we conclude.

II. FIELD EQUATIONS

The assumption of isotropy and homogeneity implies the large scale geometry described by a

metric of the form

ds2 = −dt2 + a2(t)(cid:20) dr2

1 − kr2 + r2(dθ2 + sen2θdφ2)(cid:21) ,

(1)

in a synchronized coordinate system (a suitable set of coordinates called comoving coordinates).

The comoving observers, also called Hubble observers, are the ones located at spacelike hypersur-

faces accompanying the cosmic ﬂuid, which is at rest with respect to such hypersurfaces. Here a(t)

is an arbitrary function of the cosmic time called scale factor and k = 0, ±1, denotes the spatial
curvature of the universe for Minkowski, Riemann and Lobachevsky geometry, respectively.

Let us consider 5D spacetimes for which the metric takes the following form

ds2 = a2(t, y)(cid:26)−dt2 + u2(t)(cid:20) dr2

1 − kr2 + r2(dθ2 + sen2θdφ2)(cid:21)(cid:27) + b2(t, y)dy2,

(2)

3

where the background metric in 4D is given by the Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker line

element (1). The metric signature is given by (− + + + +). The function a(t, y) is an warp
factor with time and extra dimension dependence, while u(t) performs the usual scale factor for

an homogeneous and isotropic universe. The function b(t, y) shows the dynamics of the extra

dimension at diﬀerent times and positions in the bulk.

Let us consider the 5D action in the presence of a bulk scalar ﬁeld with the potential V (φ)

minimally coupled to the gravitational sector

S =Z d5x√−g(cid:26)2M 3R −

2

gM N∇M φ∇N φ − V (φ)(cid:27) ,

(3)

where M is the Planck mass and R is the ﬁve-dimensional Ricci scalar. In general we suppose that

the scalar ﬁeld φ depends only on time and the extra dimension y.

The Einstein equations read

RM N −

gM N R =

4M 3 TM N ,

and the energy momentum-tensor TM N for the scalar ﬁeld φ(t, y) is

TM N = ∇M φ∇N φ − gM N(cid:18) 1

At this point we need to consider separately some diﬀerent regimes of the above equations. Af-

terwards, we solve the time-dependent part of the solutions and, then, the spatial part is analyzed.

It is interesting to notice that the set of equations (18)-(20) with k 6= 0 and u = 1, recover the

result obtained by [4], whose solution is

β(t) = β0e±√−kt.

On the other hand, for the case in which k 6= 0 e u 6= 1 and using the following redeﬁnition

where f (t) is an arbitrary function, we have

u(t) = f (t)β(t)

and

β(t) ∝ sec (t) ,

β(t) ∝ sec h (t) .

We shall investigate the cosmological outputs of the obtained solutions in Section V.

IV. SPATIAL-DEPENDENT SOLUTIONS

Now we shall consider the spatial part of the equations (11), (12) and (13):

(36)

(37)

(38)

There are two interesting cases, concerning the separation constants which we are going to inves-

tigate in detail. The ﬁrst one is given by the vanishing of both.

A. The case ∆ = Σ = 0

For better dealing with the system of equations we use the re-deﬁnition,

In the light of (39), the Equations (36)-(38) become

α(y) = eA(y).

and

1

φ′2 = −A′′,

V (φ) = −A′′ − 4(cid:0)A′(cid:1)2 ,

φ′′ + 4A′φ′ =

dV
dφ

.

(39)

(40)

(41)

Assuming, for ulterior convenience, that

φ′ = rWφ(φ), A′ = sW (φ),

8

(42)

and substituting the equations (42) in (41) we ﬁnd s = −1/3. Therefore the potential acquires the
form

V (φ) = r2(cid:20) 1

2

(Wφ)2 −

2
3

W (φ)2(cid:21) .

The derivative of Eq. (43) with respect to φ, Vφ, reads

Therefore the potential itself can be expressed as

W (φ)2,

φ′ = Wφ(φ), A′ = −

A(y) = −

3Z W [φ(y)] dy.

Now we turn ourselves to a diﬀerent arrangement of the separation constants.

B. The case ∆ = −Σ 6= 0

Making use of the expression (39) in (36)-(38), one gets

φ′2 = Σe−2A − 3A′′,

2
3

V (φ) = Σe−2A − 4(cid:0)A′(cid:1)2

− A′′,

and

φ′′ + 4A′φ′ =

dV
dφ

.

(43)

(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

Combining the equations (48), we obtain

By assuming [5] that

V (φ) = 3[A′′ − 2(cid:0)A′(cid:1)2] +

3
2

φ′2.

φ′ = aW1φ(φ), A′ = bW2(φ) ,

φ′′ = a2W1φφW1φ, A′′ = abW2φW1φ,

and substituting Eqs. (51) and (52) into (50), we have

V (φ) = 3[abW2φW1φ − 2b2W 2

2 ] +

3
2

a2W 2

1φ.

Taking the derivative of (53) with respect to φ one gets

dV
dφ

= 3[abW2φφW1φ + abW1φφW2φ − 4b2W2W2φ] + 3a2W1φW1φφ,

9

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

and inserting (54) in the scalar ﬁeld equation (49), one arrives at the following consistence equation

for the superpotential

a[4bW2 − 3bW2φφ − 2aW1φφ]W1φ = 3b[aW1φφ − 4bW2]W2φ,

where a = 1 and b = 1/3.

Now we deﬁne the following quantities

W1 = W + λZ

and W2 = W + σZ,

(55)

(56)

from which one can see that some terms can be written as a total derivative, and the equation (55)

takes the form

In order to keep some similarity with the well known literature, we look for a solution as the

one presented in Ref. [7], for instance. We choose thereof

Z(φ) = Z0 cos(vφ + s).

In the light of Eq. (59), gathering Z, Z 2

W = C1 + (λ − 2σ) cos φ,

with the choice Z0 = 1 and s = 0 in equation (60).

Using Eq. (64) into (51) and (52), we obtain

By means of Eqs. (67) and (68) for the expression (50), we obtain the following shape for the

potential

3(1 + G(φ)2

(69)

where, G(φ) ≡ [arctan(φ/2)]2(λ−σ)2

.

In the ﬁgures (1) and (2) we depict the proﬁles of φ(y) and A(y) in the relevant range where

the scalar ﬁeld is also varying. Before to delve into the eﬀective quantities study, we remark by

passing that, despite the rather non-trivial functional form of the obtained solutions, the resulting

spacetime is after all well behaved. In fact, all the Kretschmann scalars associated to the solutions

are ﬁnite.

V. EFFECTIVE HUBBLE PARAMETER AND SCALE FACTOR

In this section, from the found solutions for β(t), we obtain the eﬀective Hubble parameter

as well as the eﬀective scale factor. The Hubble parameter, H =

.
a/a, is used to measure the

expansion rate of the universe. The time elapsed in this scenario is the so called proper time or

12

cosmic time.

In view of the transformation

dτ = β(t)dt,

it is possible to construct the eﬀective Hubble parameter

Hef f =

[ln(β(t)u(t)] =

where

aef f (t) = β(t)u(t).

A. The case ∆ = Σ = 0

Consider for a while the case that k = 0, so that

β(t) =

C
u(t)

and therefore

Hef f (τ ) = 0

and aef e = constant.

(70)

(71)

(72)

(73)

(74)

This case leads, then, to the typical Hubble parameter describing a static universe, sometimes

called Einstein’s universe.

Within this case (∆ = Σ = 0) but now with k 6= 0, the solution is given by

where we deﬁned that dz = dt/pf (t). Thus, we ﬁnd the expression for the cosmic time τ as given

by

τ = Cz ± z2√

−k/2.

(77)

Hence we have

dτ = β(t)dt =

β(t) = ±

Finally, substituting the expressions (80) and (79) into (71), one can verify that the eﬀective Hubble

parameter decays with the inverse of τ ,while that scale factor is linearly growing and real as far as

k < 0.

Hef f (τ ) =

1
τ

and aef f (τ ) = 2√

−k τ .

(81)

It is reasonable that the behavior of Hef f (τ ) is the one expected both for the matter and radiation

dominated phase of the universe. Unfortunately, however, the corresponding scale factor grows

much faster than it should in a realistic scenario.

B. The case ∆ = −Σ 6= 0

Now let us consider the case in which ∆ = −Σ 6= 0 both for k = 0 and k 6= 0. Firstly, we

analyze the simplest case with k = 0, leading to

and from Eq. (66),

β(t) =

(83)

where b = pΣ/3 and z = R t

gets

0 dt′/u(t′). Inserting Eqs. (82) and (83) into the expression (71), one

Hef f (t) = u(t)(C1 ± bz)

= u(t)(C1 ± bz)

(84)

and therefore

whose integration leads to

Hef f (τ ) = ±r Σ

3

,

aef f (τ ) = a0 exp ±r Σ

3

τ! .

14

(85)

(86)

We can note that the above solution to aef e(τ ) with k = 0 is similar to the solution found for

an usual universe (without any brane), and dominated by the vacuum energy, i.e.,

a(t) ∝ exp ±r Λ

3

t! .

(87)

where Λ > 0 is the cosmological constant. This fact is more important that it may sound. In

fact, in the context of thick braneworlds, as discussed in the Introduction, there is no how to

directly relate the four-dimensional cosmological constant with some counterpart quantity in ﬁve

dimensions, or even some property of the brane modeling. In this approach, however, we see that

the separation constant (necessary to solve the gravitational system endowed with a brane) takes

the place of the four-dimension cosmological constant. The solution given in (86) could, indeed,

represent the current phase of accelerated expansion of our universe in a ΛCDM (Lambda Cold

Dark Matter) model.

Finally, for the case in which k 6= 0, and remembering that

where z ≡R t

β(t) = −

, it can be seen that

By taking dz = dt/u(t) and integrating the above expression, we obtain

(88)

(89)

(91)

Now, by inverting the Eq. (90) for z as a function of τ , one gets

τ = −r3k

The above Hubble parameter, despite the fact that it presents an expected behavior at large values

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have investigated exact solutions for a FRW braneworld, whose brane is performed by a

bulk scalar ﬁeld. The general idea was to ﬁnd out explicit solutions which could, at least in some

regime, to perform the large scale dynamics of the universe. In the course of our analysis a plenty

of possibilities had appeared. Among them, we believe we pay attention to the most physically

appealing cases.

In some aspects, the physical outputs can model a speciﬁc era of the known universe, as in the

case represented by Eq. (81) in which the matter and radiation phases can be reached. By the same

token, in the speciﬁc k = 0, ∆ 6= −Σ case, the separation constant Σ can mimic a four-dimensional
cosmological constant for a de-Sitter-like universe. Therefore, the late-time acceleration can be

modeled without regarding to any type of dark energy.

Currently we are delving into the possibility to describe more aspects of the cosmic evolution.

To accomplish that, more bulk scalar ﬁelds, as well as diﬀerent potentials may be in order. We

shall postpone these generalizations for a future work.
