Magnetic skyrmions have attracted broad attention during recent years because they are regarded
as promising candidates as bits of information in novel data storage devices. A broad range of
theoretical and experimental investigations have been conducted with the consideration of rotational
symmetric skyrmions in isotropic environments. However, one naturally observes a huge variety of
anisotropic behavior in many experimentally relevant materials. In the present work, we investigate
the inﬂuence of anisotropic environments onto the formation and behavior of the non-collinear spin
states of skyrmionic materials by means of Monte-Carlo calculations. We ﬁnd skyrmionic textures
which are far from having a rotational symmetric shape. Furthermore, we show the possibility to
employ periodic modulations of the environment to create skyrmionic tracks.

PACS numbers:

Magnetic skyrmions were originally proposed and in-
vestigated in theoretical studies[1, 2] and only recently,
they were found experimentally in the bulk and thin
ﬁlms of non-centrosymmetric materials[3–9] as well as in
ultra-thin magnetic ﬁlms at crystal surfaces[10–12]. They
are particle-like objects with a non-vanishing topological
charge that is considered to protect them from contin-
uous transformation into the saturated magnetic state.
Together with their small lateral size in the nanometer
range, this makes skyrmions an interesting candidate for
bits of information and information carriers in novel data
storage devices [13, 14]. Typically, magnetic skyrmions
form due to the competition of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM) interaction[15, 16] and the exchange interaction in
the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld. The DM in-
teraction can provide a non-vanishing contribution in the
presence of inversion asymmetry combined with a large
spin-orbit interaction. The properties of skyrmions have
both theoretically and experimentally mainly been inves-
tigated in the context of materials providing an isotropic
environment up to now which leads to the formation
of skyrmions with a rotational symmetric equilibrium
shape. There are only few studies that deal with the
inﬂuence of anisotropic environments and only recently,
the experimental observation of skyrmions which are de-
formed with respect to the rotational symmetric shape
has been reported for chiral magnets with crystal lattice
strain[17].

However, various experimentally feasible materials
naturally exhibit anisotropic behavior for multiple rea-
sons. In the discussion of the origins, we focus on the ma-
terial systems that allow for interface induced skyrmionic
states, only. These material systems typically consist of
a single or multiple atomic, magnetic layers of diﬀerent
atomic species which are deposited succeedingly onto a
non-magnetic supporting crystal. The combination of
materials with diﬀerent lattice constants can give rise to
lattice strain and reconstructions in the magnetic sur-
face layers which then exhibit anisotropic environments

as has been discussed only recently for the double[18] and
triple[19] atomic layers of Fe on Ir(111). Therefore, the
inﬂuence of anisotropic environments onto the behavior
of skyrmionic states is already interesting for practical
reasons. More intriguing is, especially with respect to
technological applications, to study the capability of tai-
loring the properties of skyrmions such as their shape
and lateral position by anisotropic environments.

Here, we report on Monte-Carlo investigations of the
magnetic pattern formation in systems with modulated
environments and show skyrmionic states which exhibit
shapes very diﬀerent from the rotational symmetric ones
that have been discussed in previous studies. Also, we
discuss the possibility to align skyrmions along tracks
and relate it to recent investigations conducted on the
double and triple layers of Fe on Ir(111)[18, 19].

We describe a skyrmionic ultra-thin magnetic ﬁlm by

the standard eﬀective Hamiltonian

H = − X<i,j>

Jij Si · Sj − X<i,j>

D ij · (Si × Sj)

+Xi

Ki(eKi · Si)2 − µXi

B · Si

consisting of the exchange energy, the DM energy,
the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the Zeeman en-
ergy. The classical three-dimensional spins Si of unit
length can rotate freely on the unit sphere. We consider
an isotropic nearest neighbor DM interaction strength
|D| = D and for symmetry reasons we assume DM-
vectors which both lie in the plane of the magnetic
ﬁlm and are perpendicular to the connection line be-
tween neighboring spins[20]. The values of Jij , Ki, eKi,
µ and B provide the exchange energy parameter, the
anisotropy energy parameter, the direction of the uni-
axial anisotropy, the magnetic moment and an external
magnetic ﬁeld. A detailed phase space of a magnetic ﬁlm
which can be described by an Hamiltonian of the type
given in eq. 1 with an isotropic exchange interaction

can be found elsewhere[5, 21, 22]. In order to summa-
rize, a spin-spiral state with a ﬁxed rotational sense is
the ground state at low temperatures and zero external
magnetic ﬁeld. The application of a perpendicular ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld can cause the system to exhibit a
skyrmionic state at an intermediate ﬁeld strength or the
saturated ferromagnetic state at a suﬃciently large ﬁeld.
We use two-dimensional triangular lattices with the
lattice constant a and mimic the behavior of multiple
magnetic layers by employing eﬀective nearest-neighbor
exchange interaction parameters Jij similar to previous
investigations of the orientation of domain walls [23, 24].
However, we go beyond the earlier model and modulate
the strength of the exchange coupling not only as a func-
tion of the orientation of the respective bond but as a
generalization also of the position in the lattice accord-
ing to the following description

The equation 2 is equivalent to the parametrization of
an ellipse with the semi-major axis jM and semi-minor
axis jm in the case of jM > jm. The ellipse lies within the
plane of the magnetic ﬁlm and the direction of the major
axis e is locally rotated by the angle α with respect to
the [101] direction. r ij is the vector connecting the lat-
tice sites i and j. The choice of unequal parameters jM
and jm provides an anisotropic interaction strength which
then depends on the crystallographic direction. The an-
gle αmax and the period λ in units of a can be used to
create a periodic modulation of the anisotropic exchange
environment along the crystallographic direction [101].

Fig. 1a shows the perpendicular component of the mag-
netization of a spin-spiral state for the modulation period
λ = 20 a and modulation angle αmax = 29◦. The inter-
action strengths are jm/jM = 0.5 and jm/D = 1.6 and
the anisotropy is K = 0. The temperature of the system
was decreased from kBT /D = 1.7 to kBT /D = 8.6 · 10−3
using 20 temperature steps with 105 Monte-Carlo steps
each ensuring that the global energy minimum is reached.
We used a single spin update mechanism based on the
Metropolis algorithm. The resulting spin-spirals have a
wave length of approximately 16.5 a. The wave fronts
are on average aligned in parallel to the [101] direction
and the periodicity of their zigzag pattern is in agree-
ment with the modulation period of the exchange en-
ergy. Part of the spin contrast vanishes (Fig. 1 b,c) when
calculating the projection of the in-plane component of
the magnetization onto the directions which enclose an
angle of ±αmax = ±29◦ with the [101] direction. This
ﬁnding can be veriﬁed by the investigation of the inci-

dence nφ of the spins’ azimuthal angles φ with respect
to the [101] direction which is shown in Fig. 1 d. With a
vanishing modulation amplitude αmax = 0, the spins are
aligned in the plane given by the system’s normal vector
and the [121] direction. An increase of the modulation
amplitude αmax causes the single peaks at ±0.5 π to split
into double peaks with a distance of approximately αmax.
The present model seems to capture the main features of
the spin-spiral states which have been observed experi-
mentally in the double and triple atomic layers of Fe on
Ir(111)[18, 19].

However, it is more intriguing to explore the inﬂu-
ence of the modulation of the exchange energy onto the
skyrmion state. Fig. 2 (a-f) show the magnetic ground
states which are obtained when the temperature of the
system is reduced with applied constant magnetic ﬁelds.
Except for the magnetic ﬁeld, all simulation parame-
ters are chosen to be the same as before. The spin-
spirals break up at the magnetic ﬁeld µB/D = 0.237
and elongated zigzag structures are created which even-
tually shrink at magnetic ﬁeld strengths larger than
µB/D = 0.284. No individual magnetic objects are ob-
served for ﬁelds larger than µB/D = 0.62. The magnetic
objects possess a unique rotational sense and yield a non-
vanishing topological charge Q which is usually deﬁned

as an integral over the magnetic surface A whose local
direction of magnetization is described by the continuous
ﬁeld m. For the present investigations, an adoption of
the formula for discrete systems is used. Furthermore,
the magnetic objects are non-rotational symmetric as in-
vestigated exemplarily for the marked spin texture in
Fig. 2d. Fig. 2g,h show the atomic spin conﬁguration and
the corresponding line proﬁles of the spins’ polar angles.
The proﬁles of the polar angle of the local magnetization
direction clearly show an elongation of the structure into
the [101] direction compared to the [121] direction.

So far, we have focused on the eﬀects of a spatial mod-
ulation of the exchange energy parameter in skyrmionic

3

materials and neglected the anisotropy energy. However,
from previous studies it is known that the anisotropy
energy can in principle vary locally in thin magnetic
ﬁlms[25]. In the following, we investigate the eﬀects of a
spatial modulation of the anisotropy energy in combina-
tion with an isotropic exchange and DM interaction. We
introduce stripe-like regions with an easy in-plane axis
parallel to the [121] direction and easy in-plane axis par-
allel to the [101] direction of the widths dl1 = 18 a and
dl2 = 2 a which are periodically repeated along the [101]
direction with a periodicity of 20 a. In Fig. 3 a, a sketch
of the atomic lattice is given indicating the anisotropy
axis for each lattice site. The same anisotropy energy
constant of K/D = 0.6 is assumed for the two regions
and J/D = 2.1 is chosen. Fig 3 b)-d) show the magnetic
ground states for diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds after the re-
duction of the temperature in the same fashion as before.
The spin-spiral period at zero magnetic ﬁeld is approx-
imately 16 a and the wave fronts are aligned in parallel
to the [101] direction. With an applied magnetic ﬁeld of
µB/D = 0.52, an ordered state of elongated magnetic
objects is formed. Their centers lie in the middle of the
regions that possess an anisotropy axis parallel to the
[121] direction and their elongation into the [101] direc-
tion is determined by the areas in which the anisotropy
axis is parallel to the [101] direction. This ﬁnding is ver-
iﬁed exemplarily for a single magnetic object which is
highlighted in Fig. 3c. Fig. 3 e shows the corresponding
spin conﬁguration and Fig. 3 f displays the proﬁles of
the polar angle of the magnetization along two perpen-
dicular crystallographic axes. One can clearly discern a
lateral size of the magnetic object parallel to the [101]
direction of about 20 a.
In other words, the modula-
tion of the anisotropy energy aligns the magnetic objects
on tracks along the [121] direction. For magnetic ﬁelds
larger than µB/D ≈ 0.7, the magnetic objects split into
two smaller parts which themselves vanish for ﬁelds larger
than µB/D ≈ 0.9.

For technological applications, it would be desirable to
align skyrmions on tracks along which they then may be
moved for example via a spin-polarized current[14, 26–
28]. This may be realized by producing long narrow
stripes of magnetic materials along which the skyrmions
can propagate. Another idea would be to use anisotropic
environments due to lattice strain in pseudomorphically
grown ultrathin magnetic ﬁlms. An experimentally rele-
vant system may be the recently investigated triple layer
of Fe on Ir(111)[19].

In the following, we want to gain insight into the for-
mation of linearly aligned skyrmionic structures along a
track by a spatial modulation of the energy parameters
in a 2D model system. For this purpose, we combine the
eﬀects of the modulation of the exchange and anisotropy
energy with an isotropic DM-interaction on the magnetic
ground state of skyrmionic systems. The parameters for
the exchange and DM-interaction are chosen as in the

simulations for Fig. 1, 2. Additionally, we assume a
spatial modulation of an easy in-plane anisotropy axis
with the energy K/D = 0.6 similar to simulations for
Fig. 3 but partly adopt the anisotropy axes to follow the
modulation of the exchange interaction as indicated in
Fig. 4a. For two magnetic ﬁelds, the magnetic ground
states at low temperatures are shown in Fig. 4b,c. One
observes ordered bent non-collinear spin states with a
non-vanishing topological charge at the magnetic ﬁeld
µB/D = 0.52 which vanish at magnetic ﬁelds larger
than µB/D ≈ 0.71. As before, the magnetic objects are
aligned along tracks parallel to the [121] direction. How-
ever, the magnetic objects of neighboring tracks inﬂuence
each other in the current status in such a way that they
could not be moved independently from each other paral-
lel to the [121] direction. We exclude every second track
by locally substituting the easy in-plane axis by an easy
out-of-plane anisotropy axis with the energy K/D = 0.6.
The resulting magnetic equilibrium skyrmion-like pat-
terns are conﬁned to spatially separated tracks parallel
to the [121] direction (Fig. 4d,e).

To summarize, we have shown possible inﬂuences of
spatial modulations of the exchange interaction and
anisotropy energy onto the formation of non-collinear
spin-states in skyrmionic materials.
Initially, magnetic
skyrmions were introduced as rotational symmetric ob-
jects with a non-vanishing topological charge that form
in the presence of DM interaction, the exchange inter-
action and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy.
In con-
trast to bubble domains, they possess an equilibrium size.
Since the magnetic objects that we have obtained possess
the topological charge Q = 1 and have equilibrium sizes
. 10 nm, they exhibit indeed the main characteristics of
skyrmions.
