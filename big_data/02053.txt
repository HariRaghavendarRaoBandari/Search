Abstract

It is shown that the celebrated Heun operator He = −(a0x3+a1x2+a2x) d2

dx2 +(b0x2+b1x+b2) d

dx +

c0x is the Hamiltonian of the sl(2, R)-quantum Euler-Arnold top of spin ν in a constant magnetic

ﬁeld. For a0 6= 0 it is canonically-equivalent to BC1(A1)− Calogero-Moser-Sutherland quantum

models, if a0 = 0, all known one-dimensional quasi-exactly-solvable problems are reproduced, if,

in addition, b0 = c0 = 0, then all four well-known one-dimensional exactly-solvable problems are

reproduced. If spin ν of the top takes (half)-integer value the Hamiltonian gets ﬁnite-dimensional

invariant subspace and a number of polynomial eigenfunctions occurs. Discrete systems on uniform

and exponential lattices are introduced which are canonically-equivalent to one described by the

Heun operator.

I. THE HEUN OPERATOR

The general Heun operator P3∂2

x + P2∂x + P1 has the form

He = −(a0x3 + a1x2 + a2x)∂2

x + (b0x2 + b1x + b2)∂x + c0x ,

∂x ≡

d
dx

,

(1)

it depends on 7 free parameters (a0,1,2, b0,1,2, c0): we do not ﬁx normalization (overall factor)

but choose the reference point for x in such a way that the coeﬃcient in front of the second

derivative vanishes at x = 0; for a sake of future convenience, we do not factorize the

coeﬃcient (a0x2 + a1x + a2)x further to a product of monomials. In the basis of monomials

the operator He has a form of tri-diagonal matrix. Note that the celebrated Heun equation

[1] (see e.g. for the general discussion [2]) and [3], [4] (reference therein)

He − c1

P3

u(x) = 0 ,

occurs, where c1 is called the accessory parameter.

II. THE EULER-ARNOLD QUANTUM TOP

The Hamiltonian of the sl(2, R)-quantum Euler-Arnold top of spin ν in a constant mag-

netic ﬁeld B is given by

H = t+0J+J0 + t+−J+J− + t00J0J0 + t0−J0J− + B+J+ + B0J0 + B−J− ,

(2)

where t+0, t+−, t00, t0− and B+, B0, B− are constants. Here J’s span the sl(2, R)-Lie algebra:

they obey the sl(2, R) commutation relations: making ; linear transformations the general

sl(2, R) quantum top in a constant magnetic ﬁeld can be reduced to the form (2).

It is

evident that this top is integrable: the second Casimir operator C2 is the integral, it always

commutes with H. The top (2) can be constrained by imposing a condition that C2 is a

constant,

C2 ≡

1
2

{J+J−} − J0J0 = −ν(ν + 1) ,

(3)

where {J+J−} ≡ J+J− +J−J+ denotes the anti-commutator. Here tα,β , α, β = ±, 0 deﬁnes

the tensor of inertia, B = (B+, B0, B−) deﬁnes a magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, the Hamiltonian (2)

with constraint (3) depends on 7 free parameters as well as the operator (1).

2

III. sl(2, R)-LIE ALGEBRA

The sl(2, R)-algebra can be naturally spanned by diﬀerential operators, by diﬀerence

(shift) operators and by diﬀerence (dilation) operators.

A.

sl(2, R)-Lie algebra and diﬀerential operators

In ﬁrst order diﬀerential operators the sl(2, R)-Lie algebra is realized as follows,

J− = ∂x

,

J0 = x∂x − ν , J+ = x(x∂x − 2ν) ,

(4)

where the parameter ν is spin.

It is easy to see that in representation (4) the Casimir

operator C2 is the constant, see (3), thus, the constraint is fulﬁlled.

By substituting (4) into (2) we get the Heun operator (1), hence, H = He. In particular,

− a0 = g+0 , b0 = g+0(1 − 3ν) + B+ , c0 = 2ν(νg+0 − B+) .

These parameters satisfy a remarkable condition

− 2ν(2ν − 1)a0 + 2νb0 + c0 = 0 ,

(5)

(6)

which implies that for any a0, b0, c0 one can ﬁnd ν such that this condition is fulﬁlled. This ν

has a meaning of the sl(2, R) spin of representation. One can reparameterize (1) by replacing

c0 = 2ν(2ν − 1)a0 − 2νb0 ,

to have the condition (6) fulﬁlled automatically.

B.

sl(2, R)-Lie algebra and diﬀerence (shift) operators

Let us introduce the shift operator,

Tδf (x) = f (x + δ)

, Tδ = eδ∂x ,

and construct a canonical pair of shift operators (see e.g. [5])

Dδ =

Tδ − 1

δ

, xδ = xT−δ = x(1 − δD−δ) ,

(7)

3

where the operator Dδ,

Dδf (x) =

f (x + δ) − f (x)

δ

,

is the so-called Norlund derivative. It is easy to check that [Dδ, xδ] = 1, hence, forming the

canonical pair.

In ﬁrst order diﬀerence (shift) operators the sl(2, R)-Lie algebra is realized as follows,

J− = Dδ

,

J0 = xδDδ − ν , J+ = xδ(xδDδ − 2ν) ,

(8)

where the parameter ν is spin, while δ is arbitrary parameter.

It is easy to see that in

representation (8) the Casimir operator C2 is the constant, see (3), it does not depend on

δ, thus, the constraint is fulﬁlled. By substituting (8) into (2) we get the ﬁnite-diﬀerence

(shift) Heun operator

H (s)

e = −(a0x3

δ + a1x2

δ + a2xδ)D2

δ + (b0x2

δ + b1xδ + b2)Dδ + c0xδ ,

(9)

cf. (1). This operator acts on uniform lattice space with spacing δ

{. . . , x − 2δ , x − δ , x , x + δ , x + 2δ , . . .}

marked by x ∈ R - a position of a central (or reference) point of the lattice. Explicitly, it is

ﬁve-point lattice operator,

H (s)

e f (x) = A−3(x)f (x−3δ)+A−2(x)f (x−2δ)+A−1(x)f (x−δ)+A0(x)f (x)+A1(x)f (x+δ) ,

where A’s are polynomials. In the limit δ → 0, the operator H (s)

e becomes the Heun operator

He (1).

C.

sl(2, R)-Lie algebra and diﬀerence (dilation) operators

Let us introduce the dilation operator,

Tq f (x) = f (qx)

,

Tq = qA , A ≡ x ∂x ,

and construct a canonical pair of dilation operators [6]

Dq = x−1 Tq − 1
q − 1

, xq =

A(q − 1)
Tq − 1

x ,

(10)

4

where xq Dq = A and Dq xq = ∂x x = A + 1. The operator Dq is the so-called Jackson

symbol (or the Jackson derivative). Both operators xq , Dq are pseudodiﬀerential operators

with action on monomials as follows,

Dqxn = {n}q xn−1 , xqxn =

n + 1

{n + 1}q

xn+1 ,

where {n}q = 1−qn
1−q

is the so called q-number.

In ﬁrst order diﬀerence (dilation) operators the sl(2, R)-Lie algebra is realized in the

following way,

J− = Dq

,

J0 = x∂x − ν , J+ = xq(x∂x − 2ν) ,

(11)

cf.(4), where the parameter ν is spin. It is easy to see that in representation (11) the Casimir

operator C2 is the constant, see (3), it does not depend on q, thus, the constraint is fulﬁlled.

By substituting (11) into (2) we get the ﬁnite-diﬀerence (dilation) Heun operator

H (d)

e = −(a0x3

q + a1x2

q + a2xq)D2

q + (b0x2

q + b1xq + b2)Dq + c0xq ,

(12)

cf. (1), (9). In fact, it is the diﬀerential-diﬀerence operator

H (d)

e = −(a0x2

qx∂x + a1xqx∂x + a2x∂x)Dq + (b0xqx∂x + b1x∂x + b2Dq) + c0xq ,

acting on exponential lattice {xqn} , n = 0, 1, 2, . . . with reference point marked by x ∈ R.

IV. PROPERTIES

• Operators He, H (s)

are canonically-equivalent, see (7), (10);

• if 2ν = n is integer, the Heun operator He(H (s)

e

, H (d)

e ) (1) ((9), (12)) has (2ν + 1)-

dimensional invariant subspace in polynomials Pn, hence, [He, ∂n+1

(11);

] : Pn → {0} and

, (J−)n+1] : Pn → {0}, see (8),

• “Polynomial” isospectrality. Let us assume the Heun operator He(x) has a formal

polynomial eigenfunction,

φ(x) =

n

X

k=0

αkxk ,

5

with eigenvalue ǫ, then the discrete (shift) Heun operator H (s)

e (x) has a formal poly-

nomial eigenfunction

φδ(x) =

n

X

k=0

αkx(k) ,

where x(k+1) ≡ x(x−δ) . . . (x−kδ) is the Pochhammer symbol or quasi-monomial, with
eigenvalue ǫ and the discrete (dilation) Heun operator H (d)

e (x) has a formal polynomial

eigenfunction

φq(x) =

n

k=0

αk

k!

{k}q!

xk ,

where k! = 1 · 2 · . . . k is factorial and {k}q! = {1}q · {2}q · . . . {k}q is the so-called

q-factorial, with eigenvalue ǫ;

• making canonical (gauge rotation) transformation

∂x → ∂x + A ≡ e−φ∂xeφ , x → x ,

(13)

where A = φ′(x), the Heun operator (1) can be transformed to the Schr¨odinger oper-

ator with rational potential

He(x) = ∆g(x) + V (x) , V (x) = Bx +

Q2(x)
P3(x)

,

(14)

where ∆g(x) is one-dimensional Laplace-Beltrami operator with contravariant metric
g11 = P3, B = 3

is the parameter, Q2 is the 2nd degree polynomial.

16 a0 + 23b0 + c0 + b2

4a0

Then making a change of variables - another canonical transformation,

∂x →

1
x′
τ

∂τ , x → τ (x) ,

(15)

where (x′

τ )2 = a0x3 +a1x2 +a2x, we arrive at the Schr¨odinger operator in the Cartesian

coordinate τ ,

He(τ ) = ∂2

τ + V (x(τ )) , V (x(τ )) = Bx(τ ) +

Q2(x(τ ))
P3(x(τ ))

,

(16)

• “Canonical” covariance. Take (x − α)µ as the gauge factor, where α is root of the

cubic equation P3(α) = 0. For any parameters {a, b, c} one can indicate µ such that

the gauge-rotated Heun operator remains the Heun operator,

(x − α)−µ He(x; {a, b, c}) (x − α)µ = He(x; {a, ˜b, ˜c}) .

For example, for zero root, α = 0, the exponent µ = 1 + b2
a2

. For the Lame operator

µ = 1

2 for any root α

• if a0 6= 0,

(i) He with additive constant c1 is factorizable in the sl(2, R)-algebra

He + c1 = TaTb ,

where Ta,b = αa,bJ+ + βa,bJ0 + γa,bJ− + Da,b with αb = 0 and c1 = DaDb;

(ii) He is canonically-equivalent to the BC1(A1) elliptic Calogero-Moser-Sutherland

Hamiltonian (see e.g.

[8]) written in Cartesian coordinate τ ; if in (1), P2 = −P ′

3/2,

He coincides with the Lame operator.

Example: BC1 elliptic Calogero-Moser-Sutherland model.

Take the Heun operator

hBC1(x) =

4(x3 − 3 λx2 + 3δx)∂2

x + 6(1 + 2µ)(x2 − 2λx + δ)∂x − 2n(2n + 1 + 6µ)(x − λ) , (17)

where λ, δ, µ, n are parameters; here a0 = −4, b0 = 6(1 + 2µ), c0 = − 2n(2n + 1 + 6µ), c.f.

(1) and n = 2ν, c.f. (6). In space of monomials xk, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . the operator hBC1(x) has

the form of tri-diagonal, Jacobi matrix. In terms of sl(2, R)-generators (4), it reads

hBC1 = 4 J +(n) J 0(n) − 12λJ 0(n) J 0(n) + 12δ J 0(n) J −

+ 2 (4n + 1 + 6µ) J +(n) − 12 λ(n + 2µ)J 0(n) + 6 δ (n + 1 + 2µ) J − + λn(n + 2) . (18)

Making the gauge rotation of (17),

HBC1 = −

2 ,

and changing x → τ ,

(x′

τ )2 = 4(x3 − 3 λx2 + 3δx) ,

we arrive at BC1 elliptic Calogero-Moser-Sutherland Hamiltonian [9],

HB = −

1
2

∂2
τ + 2µ(µ − 1) ℘(2τ ) + (2n + 1 + 2µ)(n + 2µ) ℘(τ ) ,

(19)

where ℘(τ ) ≡ ℘(τ |g2, g3) is the Weierstrass function with its invariants parametrized as

follows,

g2 = 12(λ2 − δ) ,

g3 = 4λ(2λ2 − 3δ) .

7

Here λ, δ are parameters and e = −λ is the root of the ℘−Weierstrass function, ℘′(−λ) = 0.

In such a parametrization the variable x has the form

x = ℘(τ |g2, g3) + λ .

• if a0 = 0, but b0 6= 0, all known ten families of QES Hamiltonians written in Cartesian

coordinate τ are reproduced [10–12].

• if a0 = 0, and b0 = c0 = 0, the Riemann (hypergeometrical) operator occurs, thus,

all known exactly-solvable problems (the Harmonic oscillator, Morse and P¨oschl-Teller

potentials, Coulomb problem) are reproduced once written in the Cartesian coordinate

τ

.

V. CLASSICAL LIMIT

The classical limit appears when in the top Hamiltonian (2) and constraint (3) the gener-

ators J’s span the Poisson algebra, thus, the Lie bracket is replaced by the Poisson bracket.

In this case we have classical sl(2, R) top in a constant magnetic ﬁeld.
