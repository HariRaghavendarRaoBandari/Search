A First Look at the Impact of NNNLO Theory Un-
certainties on Top Mass Measurements at the ILC

A scan of the top production threshold at a future electron-positron collider provides the possibil-
ity for a precise measurement of the top quark mass in theoretically well-deﬁned mass schemes.
With statistical uncertainties of 20 MeV or below, systematics will likely dominate the total
uncertainty of the measurement. This contribution presents a ﬁrst look at the impact of the
renormalization scale uncertainties in recent NNNLO calculations of the top pair production
cross section in the threshold region on the measurement of the top quark mass at the Interna-
tional Linear Collider.

Introduction

Due to its high mass, the top quark has only been studied at hadron colliders up to now. The most
precise direct measurements of its mass today come from the LHC, with total experimental uncer-
tainties of as low as 500 MeV [1], dominated by systematic uncertainties. Since these measurements
provide the top quark mass in the context of the event generator used in the analysis, additional
uncertainties, currently estimated to be on the order of 1 GeV, are incurred when transforming the
measured mass value to theoretically well-deﬁned mass schemes as used in precision calculations.

A scan of the top pair production cross section at an electron-positron collider holds the potential
for a precise measurement of the mass of the top quark in a theoretically well-deﬁned framework.
An experimental study [2] in the context of the future linear collider projects ILC [3] and CLIC [4]
based on detailed detector simulations has shown that statistical uncertainties of 20 MeV on the top
quark mass are reached with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb−1. In typical running scenarios for
these projects, this or higher integrated luminosities are foreseen for a threshold scan. At this level
of precision, experimental and theoretical systematics are highly relevant. In [2] and [5] experimental
systematics are estimated to be on the level of 30 - 50 MeV. The precision of the strong coupling
constant also enters in the analysis, with a corresponding uncertainty of 16 MeV based on the 2014
uncertainty of the world average of αs [6]. In [2], a naive estimate of the theory uncertainty, assuming
an overall scale uncertainty of the calculation of the cross section of 3% as used also in [7], has yielded
an uncertainty of the top mass of 56 MeV. This suggests that theory uncertainties will be among
the leading uncertainties, making a further study of this issue of high importance.

The recent completion of NNNLO QCD calculations [8] of the top pair production cross section,
including NLO non-resonant electroweak contributions [9, 10], NNNLO Higgs eﬀects and QED [11,
12], enables the study of theory uncertainties for calculations with a precision which is unlikely to
be substantially improved by the time such experimental measurements are performed at a future
e+e− collider. Here, the results of these calculations are combined with the experimental techniques
developed in [2] to perform a ﬁrst preliminary analysis of the impact of the scale uncertainties on
the top mass extraction.

2 The impact of scale uncertainties on the cross section

For the present study, a top quark mass of mPS
t = 171.5 GeV in the potential-subtracted mass
scheme [13] and a top quark width of 1.33 GeV is assumed. Figure 1 left shows the calculated cross
section as a function of collider center of mass energy, taking into account corrections due to initial
state radiation (ISR) and due to the luminosity spectrum of the ILC. Also shown are the variations
of the cross section induced by varying the renormalization scale µ in the range of 50 GeV to 350
GeV, as discussed in detail in [8].

Figure 1: Left: Top pair production cross section with NNNLO precision [8, 11], including ISR
and ILC luminosity spectrum eﬀects, also showing scale variations over the range considered in the
present analysis. Right: Variation of the cross section for changes of diﬀerent parameters, in the
context of the scale uncertainties and the statistical precision of a single 10 fb−1 data point. The
range of changes of the diﬀerent parameters is given by typical projected statistical uncertainties for
the diﬀerent quantities as listed in the ﬁgure.

Figure 1 right illustrates the eﬀect of variations of the top quark mass mt, the top quark width
Γt, the strong coupling constant αs and the top Yukawa coupling yt on the production cross section.
To allow a simple visual interpretation of these variations, the are shown for typical statistical
uncertainties projected for e+e− collider measurements of the various quantities, as listed in detail
in the ﬁgure. Note that the variation of αs corresponds to the uncertainty of the world average
quoted in 2014 [6], prior to the increase of the uncertainty in the latest evaluation [14]. Also shown
are the statistical uncertainties of a single 10 fb−1 data point and the size of the scale variations. The
latter are symmetrized to provide better visibility. It is apparent that the mass can be extracted in
a region that is less aﬀected by changes in other properties, while in particular the eﬀects of the top
Yukawa coupling and the strong coupling are highly correlated, resulting in diﬃculties of extracting
the former without substantial improvements in the precision of the latter. It is also apparent that
the scale variations are larger than the variations induced by changes of top quark parameters within
the range of the projected uncertainties, suggesting theory systematics in excess of the statistical
uncertainties.

3 A threshold scan analysis with NNNLO scale uncertainties

To provide a ﬁrst look at the impact of the NNNLO scale uncertainties on the measurement of the top
quark mass in a threshold scan, the analysis discussed in detail in [2] has been extended, as discussed
in the following. The precision with which the mass can be measured is determined by a toy MC study
which simulates a large number of threshold scans. For each iteration, data points are generated
at the energy points considered in the study, using reconstruction eﬃciencies and background levels

From the simulated
measurement points the top quark mass is determined by a template ﬁt, comparing the data points
to calculated cross section curves for diﬀerent mass hypotheses. In this study, the top quark width
and the Yukawa coupling are assumed to take their Standard Model values and are not varied. The
strong coupling constant is assumed to be an external input. The impact of the uncertainty of αs is
brieﬂy discussed in Section 5.

Figure 2: Illustration of a t¯t production thresh-
old scan, showing the best ﬁt template for a ﬁt
accounting for NNNLO scale variations and the
variations of the template for mass changes of ±
100 MeV.

In the present study, the template ﬁt is extended to account for the NNNLO scale uncertainties.
Instead of comparing the simulated data points with a line given by the cross section for a particular
mass hypothesis, the comparison is now made with a band that is deﬁned by the space between the
minimum and the maximum cross section over the range of considered renormalization scales at each
energy point. This is illustrated in Figure 2. The simulated data points correspond to 10 points
with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb−1 each, using the default cross section for mPS
t = 171.5 GeV
and µ = 80 GeV as input. The template providing the best ﬁt, in this example corresponding to a
top quark mass of 171.45 GeV, is given by the area between the two solid blue lines. Also shown
are the templates for shifts in mass by ±100 MeV, shown by the dotted lines. To account for the
bands used as templates, the calculation of the χ2 used in the template ﬁt is modiﬁed. Data points
that lie within the template they are compared to do not increase the global χ2 used in the ﬁt, for
data points beyond the band the χ2 is increased by ∆χ2 = ∆σ2/∆2
data, where ∆σ is the diﬀerence
between the measured cross section and the nearest edge of the template band, and ∆data is the
statistical uncertainty of the data point.

Since the template bands are not symmetric around the cross section for the default value for
the renormalisation scale of µ = 80 GeV, the ﬁtted mass value is biased to lower top masses by 44
GeV. This bias represents the choice of the µ parameter in the ﬁt, and is thus a trivial oﬀset that
can be corrected for. Figure 3 left shows the ﬁt results for 10 000 iterations. The standard deviation
of the distribution is 19 MeV, representing the statistical uncertainty of the ﬁtted mass. This is
only marginally higher than the same value for a ﬁt that does not include the scale variations and is
instead using just a single line per mass calculated for µ = 80 GeV. For a single analysed threshold
scan the full uncertainty of the ﬁt is larger, however, since not all data points contribute to the χ2.
This uncertainty is determined by the variations in mass that lead to an increase of the global χ2
by 1. The numerical value is determined by a parabolic ﬁt to the χ2 distribution of the template ﬁt.
For cases where the minimum of the parabola is below 0, the mass values which result in a χ2 of 1
are taken as the bounds of the uncertainties.

The distribution of the full ﬁt uncertainty for 10 000 iterations of the toy MC is given in Figure 3
right. In the present study, the mean ﬁt uncertainty is 32 MeV, with a most probable uncertainty of
30 MeV, and 90% of all iterations resulting in an uncertainty of less than 39 MeV. Assuming that the
ﬁt uncertainty is given by the quadratic sum of a purely statistical component and of an additional
ﬁt uncertainty originating from the use of the NNNLO scale uncertainties in the template ﬁt which

does not depend on the integrated luminosity, the additional ﬁt uncertainty is 25 MeV. Tests with
diﬀerent integrated luminosities have shown that while this simpliﬁed representation is not entirely
accurate, it allows a good extrapolation of the expected uncertainties with an accuracy of better
than 10% for changes of integrated luminosities of a factor of two. Larger deviations are only seen
for cases with very small integrated luminosities.

4 Systematic uncertainties derived from scale variations

Based on the analysis discussed above, the theory uncertainties associated with the measurement
of the top quark mass in a threshold scan are evaluated. This is done by performing the analy-
sis described in the previous section taking diﬀerent values of the renormalization scale µ for the
calculation of the input cross section.

per data point. As seen in the previous section, the ﬁtted mass shows a bias of 45 MeV for the
default value of µ = 80 GeV. This is explained by the fact that the cross section for µ = 80 GeV
follows the maximum of the band given by the scale variations over a wide range of center of mass
energies, as shown in Figure 1 left. Over the full range of scale variations considered here, the ﬁtted
mass varies by ±45 GeV, which is taken as the theoretical uncertainty of the mass determination in a
threshold scan. This uncertainty is comparable in size to the uncertainty derived for a naive 3% scale
uncertainty in the theory in [2]. This is not surprising, considering that the scale variations result in
typical variations of the cross section by a similar order of magnitude, however with diﬀerences in
diﬀerent regions of the threshold [8].

5 The impact of the strong coupling constant

As shown in Figure 1 right, the uncertainty of the strong coupling constant has a sizeable impact on
the overall cross section, shown in the ﬁgure for the 2014 world average uncertainty of 6 × 10−4. By
following the same strategy as for the NNNLO scale variations discussed in Section 4, the impact
of uncertainties of the strong coupling constant on the mass determination are studied. Here, the
value of αs used for the calculation of the input cross section is varied in the analysis, keeping the
other parameters constant. For variations of the order of 10−3, the bias of the reconstructed mass
depends linearly on the oﬀset in the strong coupling. The systematic uncertainty on mt is 2.7 MeV
per 10−4 uncertainty of αs, corresponding to 16 MeV for the 2014 world average [6], and to 35 MeV
for the new preliminary world average [14].

6 Summary

This ﬁrst preliminary study of the impact of the renormalization scale uncertainties of NNNLO QCD
calculations on the measurement of the top quark mass in a threshold scan at the International Linear
Collider shows that theory uncertainties are among the leading systematics of such a high-precision
measurement. The scale uncertainties enter in the present analysis in two ways:

• When accounting for the uncertainties in the template ﬁt used to extract the mass from the
measured cross section at several energy points, the templates to compare the data points
to change from lines to bands representing the scale uncertainty at each energy point. Since
data points that lie within the band given by the scale uncertainties do not contribute to
the ﬁt χ2, the uncertainty of the ﬁtted mass depends on the measured values. The mean ﬁt
uncertainty for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb−1 is 32 MeV. This can be divided into a
statistical uncertainty of 19 MeV and an additional uncertainty originating from the inclusion
of the scale uncertainties in the ﬁt, which only weakly depends on the integrated luminosity,
and amounts to 25 MeV.

• The uncertainties also result in an overall systematic uncertainty of the measured mass, with the
result of the measurement varying over a range of 90 MeV for variations of the renormalization
scale µ from 50 GeV to 350 GeV. Expressed as a symmetrized uncertainty, the theoretical
uncertainty originating from the scale variations is thus 45 MeV.

When taking theory uncertainties into account, the precision of the mass ﬁt improves only very
slowly with increasing statistics beyond a total integrated luminosity of 100 fb−1. Combining the 32
MeV ﬁt uncertainty with theoretical systematics of 45 MeV and experimental systematics estimated
to be in the few 10 MeV range, it is expected that the total uncertainties of a top quark mass
measurement in a threshold scan at a future linear electron-positron collider are at or below 100
MeV.

In upcoming studies, the ﬁrst preliminary analysis presented here will be further reﬁned to put
the conclusions on a more solid footing. It will also be extended to include other relevant top quark
properties, in particular the top quark width and the Yukawa coupling, and will be performed for
diﬀerent e+e− collider options.
