Abstract

We propose a topological model of induced gravity (pregeometry) where both New-

ton’s coupling constant and the cosmological constant appear as integration constants

in solving ﬁeld equations. The matter sector of a scalar ﬁeld is also considered, and

by solving ﬁeld equations it is shown that various types of cosmological solutions in

the FRW universe can be obtained. A detailed analysis is given of the meaning of the

BRST transformations, which make the induced gravity be a topological ﬁeld theory, by

means of the canonical quantization analysis, and the physical reason why such BRST

transformations are needed in the present formalism is clariﬁed. Finally, we propose a

dynamical mechanism for ﬁxing the Lagrange multiplier ﬁelds by following the Higgs

mechanism. The present study clearly indicates that the induced gravity can be con-

structed at the classical level without recourse to quantum ﬂuctuations of matter and

suggests an interesting relationship between the induced gravity and the topological

quantum ﬁeld theory.

Introduction

In the standard formulation of general gravity, the gravitational interaction is described by
writing down the matter action Sm in a generally covariant form, and then adding to it the
Einstein-Hilbert action plus the cosmological constant

SGR =

(1)

where G is the Newton coupling constant and Λ is the cosmological constant. Taking variation
with respect to the metric tensor gµν provides us with the well-known Einstein equations with
the cosmological constant

gµν R + Λgµν = 8πGTµν ,

where Tµν is the energy-momentum tensor of matter which is deﬁned as Tµν = − 2√−g

δgµν .
Although the Einstein equations are known to account very well for various gravitational phe-
nomena at the long distance range, the Einstein-Hilbert action (1) yields a non-renormalizable
quantum ﬁeld theory, which has made it diﬃcult to construct quantum gravity on the basis
of the the Einstein-Hilbert action (1) for a long time. 2

An entirely diﬀerent approach to quantum gravity, which is nowdays called induced gravity
or pregeometry, has stemmed from a remarkable idea by Sakharov in 1968 [1]. His basic idea
is that gravity is not fundamental but might be induced by quantum ﬂuctuations of matter
ﬁelds. In particular, the Newton coupling constant could be generated at the one-loop level
although it is vanishing at the tree level.

In the framework of the induced gravity, the existence of the Lorentzian manifold is as-
sumed a priori , but the dynamics of the geometry is not assumed but determined by radiative
corrections of matter. Thus, the geometry is regarded as a classical and ﬁxed background so
that the metric tensor ﬁeld gµν is not quantized unlike matter ﬁelds. Being expressed by using
an equation, integrating over matter ﬂuctuations at the one-loop level turns out to produce
an eﬀective action

SIG =

where dots denote the higher-derivative terms such as R2. Even if there are still some dif-
ﬁculties and subtleties in the induced gravity, the basic idea is extremely of interest in the

2Quantum gravity is considered as a quantum ﬁeld theory of gravity holding till the Planck mass scale.

In this sense, quantum gravity possesses the proper mass scale in the theory, and it is believed that beyond

the Planck mass scale, the concept of space-time in itself becomes meaningless.

In such a situation, it is

not obvious for at least the present author whether quantum gravity should be described in terms of a

renormalizable theory or not since the concept of the renormalizability in quantum ﬁeld theories does not

suppose the existence of the upper limit value of energy like the Planck mass scale.

sense that quantum gravity is now believed to be somehow an emergent phenomenon like the
induced gravity [2].

There are a number of versions of the induced gravity thus far [3]-[10], 3 but a common
feature of all the induced gravity is to derive general relativity or its generalizations via
quantum corrections of matter (or gauge ﬁeld). However, there might be a logical possibility
in such a way that without recourse to quantum ﬂuctuations of matter, gravity could be
generated by solving ﬁeld equations at the classical level. Here we have the pregeometrical
approach of string ﬁeld theory [12, 13] in mind. In this approach of string theory, the dynamics
of the geometry or the kinetic term involving a background metric is created by starting with
only a purely cubic action and then picking up a suitable classical solution where quantum
corrections play no role. One of motivations behind the study at hand is to construct such
an induced gravity within the framework of a local ﬁeld theory.

Actually, in recent works [14, 15], motivated by ideas of unimodular gravity [16]-[29], we
have constructed a new model of the induced gravity where the Newton coupling constant
and the cosmological constant simultaneously appear as integration constants in solving ﬁeld
equations. Even if these integration constants take any values and are not determined uniquely
from a fundamental principle, choosing appropriate values automatically lead to the Einstein
equations with the cosmological constant. In this paper, we will generalize this formulation
of the induced gravity by including a matter ﬁeld and try to ﬁnd a cosmological solution
describing an acceleratingly expanding universe like the present universe. Moreover, we will
propose a dynamical mechanism for ﬁxing the Lagrange multiplier ﬁelds to physically plausible
values via spontaneous symmetry breakdown.

The structure of this article is the following: In Section 2, we generalize the previous model
[14, 15] of the induced gravity by including the matter action of a scalar ﬁeld. Then adding a
ghost sector, we construct a topological ﬁeld theory. In Section 3, a detailed analysis is given
of the meaning of the BRST transfomations which were constructed in Section 2. In Section 4,
we examine the cosmological implications by ﬁnding classical solutions to the ﬁeld equations
stemming from the topological model. In Section 5, according to the Higgs mechanism, we
propose a dynamical mechanism for ﬁxing the Lagrange multiplier ﬁelds to be suitable values.
We conclude in Section 6.

2 New type of induced gravity

We start by presenting an action of a new type of induced gravity model: 4

S = Z d4x√−g(cid:26)γ (R + ∇µτ µ) + λ (1 + ∇µωµ) + β(cid:20)−

1
2

gµν∇µφ∇νφ − V (φ) + ∇µρµ(cid:21)(cid:27) ,

(4)

where γ(x), λ(x) and β(x) are the Lagrange multiplier ﬁelds enforcing the following con-
straints, respectively:

R = −∇µτ µ,

1 = −∇µωµ,

1
2

gµν∇µφ∇νφ + V (φ) = ∇µρµ.

(5)

Here τ µ, ωµ and ρµ are vector ﬁelds, which will be ﬁxed in searching for classical solutions. The

ﬁrst term in the action (4) was introduced to make the curvature density constraint √−gR = 1
[8]. The second term was also introduced to keep the unimodular constraint √−g = 1 be

invariant under diﬀeomorphisms [19]. The ﬁnal term is a new term which introduces the
matter action of a scalar ﬁeld φ with a unspeciﬁed potential V (φ).

We are now willing to show that the action (4) induces the Einstein-Hilbert action with
the cosmological constant as well as the matter action of the scalar ﬁeld by solving its ﬁeld
equations as follows: First, taking variation with respect to the vector ﬁelds reads

δτ µ = −√−g∇µγ = 0,

from which the classical solution is given by

γ(x) = ¯γ,

λ(x) = ¯λ,

β(x) = ¯β,

where ¯γ, ¯λ and ¯β are certain constants. Then, provided that we set

which is equivalent to the Einstein-Hilbert action with the cosmological constant Λ plus the
scalar matter action. In this way, we can reach the action (9) of general relativity by starting
with the action (4) of the induced gravity simply by solving ﬁeld equations at the classical
level.

A peculiar feature of this new induced gravity is that the Newton constant (G) and
the cosmological constant (Λ) appear as integration constants which are not related to any
parameters in the original induced gravity action. Let us recall that in unimodular gravity
[16]-[29], the similar phenomenon emerges for the cosmological constant and is expected to
play an important role in understanding the well-known cosmological constant problem.

Next, we wish to show that the induced gravity action (4) can be deformed into a topo-

logical quantum ﬁeld theory by adding ghosts and antighosts.

First of all, let us consider three types of the BRST transformations, which are given by

δ(1)
B γ = δ(1)
δ(2)
B λ = δ(2)
δ(3)
B β = δ(3)

B c(1) = 0,
B c(2) = 0,
B c(3) = 0,

B τ µ = ∇µc(1),

B ωµ = ∇µc(2),

B ρµ = ∇µc(3),

δ(1)
B b(1) = γ,
δ(2)
B b(2) = λ,
δ(3)
B b(3) = β,

(10)

where c(i) and b(i)(i = 1, 2, 3) are respectively ghosts with the ghost number +1 and antighosts
with the ghost number −1. One peculiar feature of the BRST transformations (10) is that
the Lagrange mutiplier ﬁelds γ, λ, β are identiﬁed with the Nakanishi-Lautrup auxiliary ﬁelds.

The last expression clearly implies that ST is invariant under three BRST transformations
(10) and it is an action of the topological quantum ﬁeld theory whose moduli space is deﬁned
by three equations (5).

About a quarter of a century ago, starting with a trivially zero classical action, we have
established a model of topological pregeomery where quantum ﬂuctuations of matter ﬁelds
have generated the Einstein-Hilbert action with the cosmological constant at the one-loop
level via the cutoﬀ which violates the topological symmetry [8, 9]. On the other hand, in this
paper, we have started with a non-trivial classical action (4) of the induced gravity, which
reduces to the Einstein-Hilbert action with the cosmological constant as well as an action of
a scalar ﬁeld at the classical level, and then added the kinetic term of the ghosts, thereby
transforming the induced gravity to a topological quantum ﬁeld theory. The above two models
of the induced gravity are obviously diﬀerent, but the close relationship between the induced
gravity and the topological ﬁeld theory seems to shed some light on the further development
of the two theories in future.

3 Meaning of BRST transformations

In the previous section, we have presented three BRST transformations (10) which are essen-
tial in deforming our induced gravity action to a topological quantum ﬁeld theory. Usually,
a topological symmetry is equivalent to a local shift symmetry by which the corresponding
ﬁeld can be gauge-ﬁxed to zero at least locally. On the other hand, our topological symme-
try is similar to the gauge symmetry of a vector ﬁeld, so it is not clear whether the BRST
transformations (10) correspond to the conventional topological symmetry. In this section,
we will demonstrate that this is indeed the case by performing the canonical quantization of
a toy model, which is similar to our induced gravity action, in a ﬂat Minkowski space-time.
Let us focus on a toy model, which captures the essential features of the BRST transforma-
tion of the induced gravity (4), in a ﬂat Minkowski space-time in order to avoid complications
associated with a curved space-time. The generalization to the curved space-time is straight-
forward and explained later. We begin with the following Lagrange density:

L = γ [Ψ(ϕ) + ∂µτ µ] + ∂µb∂µc,

(12)

where γ and τ µ are respectively a scalar and a vector ﬁeld, Ψ is a generic function of a general
ﬁeld ϕ, and then b and c are respectively an antighost and a ghost.

This Lagrangian density (12) is invariant up to a surface term under the following nilpotent

BRST transformation:

δBγ = δBϕ = δBc = 0,

δBτ µ = ∂µc,

δBb = γ.

It is easy to rewrite (12) to a BRST-exact form

L = δB {b [Ψ(ϕ) + ∂µτ µ]} .

5

(13)

(14)

In what follows, we will ignore the ghost sector since this sector is irrelevant to the following
argument. Moreover, we assume that the general ﬁeld ϕ is a ﬁxed background ﬁeld so that
we do not regard it as the dynamical variable.

We will make use of the canonical quantization procedure to clarify a hidden gauge symme-
try in the Lagrangian density (12). First, let us introduce the canonical conjugate momenta
πµ corresponding to the canonical variables τ µ 5

π0 =

∂L
∂ ˙τ 0 = γ,

πi =

∂L
∂ ˙τ i = 0,

(15)

˙τ 0 = ∂0τ 0 and the
where the overdot means the diﬀerentiation with respect to x0 = t, i.e.,
index i denotes the spacial components i = 1, 2, 3. The latter equations imply that we have
primary constraints

πi ≈ 0.

The Hamiltonian density reads

At this stage, we set up the equal-time commutation relations:

H = −π0hΨ(ϕ) + ∂iτ ii .

[τ µ(t, ~x), πν(t, ~y)] = iδµ

ν δ3(x − y).

The time evolution of the primary constraints (16) produces the secondary constraints

∂iπ0 ≈ 0.

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

It is straightforward to show that there is no ternary constraint. Thus, the whole constraint
is given by the sum of the primary constraints (16) and the secondary constraints (19), and
since these constraints commute with each other under the commutation relations (18), they
constitute the ﬁrst-class constraints, which generate gauge transformations. Actually, if we
deﬁne a generating function of the gauge transformations by

we can derive the gauge transformations associated with the constraints

Φ = iZ d3x(cid:16)ǫiπi + ξi∂iπ0(cid:17) ,

(20)

(21)

hΦ, τ 0i = −∂iξi,

hΦ, τ ii = ǫi.

However, all the parameters ξi, ǫi are not always independent. The Lorentz invariance suggests
us to take ξi = ˙ǫi. Hence, the gauge transformations are given by

5Here we regard γ as the canonical conjugate momentum for τ 0 rather than the canonical variable. It

is possible to derive the same result by using the Dirac bracket [32] even if we deal with γ as the canonical

δτ 0 = −∂iξi,

δτ i = ∂0ξi.

(22)

variable.

6

In fact, it is easy to check that the Lagrangian density (12) is invariant under the gauge
transformations (22).

The above gauge transformations mean that three components in τ µ can be gauged away
and only one component is an independent variable. Then, the Lorentz invariance again
insists that the one independent component should be a scalar ﬁeld θ described as τ µ = ∂µθ.
Substituting this expression for τ µ into the starting Langrangian density (12) gives rise to

L = γ [Ψ(ϕ) + ∂µ∂µθ] .
Note that we have no longer gauge symmetry in (23).

After integrating by parts, the Lagrangian (23) density is recast to the form

L = γΨ(ϕ) − ∂µγ∂µθ.

(23)

(24)

The presence of the mixing kinetic term −∂µγ∂µθ suggests the existence of a ghost. Indeed,
when we introduce two scalar ﬁelds φ1, φ2 instead of γ, θ by

γ =

1
√2

(φ1 + φ2) ,

θ =

1
√2

(φ1 − φ2) ,

the Lagrangian density reads

L =

1
√2

(φ1 + φ2) Ψ(ϕ) −

1
2

(∂µφ1∂µφ1 − ∂µφ2∂µφ2) .

(25)

(26)

This form of the Lagrangian density clearly shows that φ2 is a ghost ﬁeld whereas φ1 is a
normal scalar ﬁeld.

One reasonable way to remove the ghost φ2, which violates the unitarity of the theory,

from the physical spectrum is to introduce a topological symmetry like

δθ(x) = ε(x).

(27)

Then, the corresponding BRST transformation is obtained by replacing the gauge parameter
ε(x) with a ghost, which we call c(x). Accordingly, the resulting BRST transfomation for
τ µ = ∂µθ takes the form

δBτ µ = ∂µc.

(28)

This is nothing but the BRST transformation which appears in Eq. (10), in case of a ﬂat
Minkowski space-time. In this way, we have shown that the BRST transformations (10) are
really those corresponding to topological symmetries.

So far, for simplicity we have limited ourselves to the toy model (12) in a ﬂat Minkowski
space-time. Although an analysis beomes a little intricated owing to complications associated
with the property of the curved space-time, the above result remains valid with a suitable

7

L = √−gγ [Ψ(ϕ) + ∇µτ µ]

= √−gγΨ(ϕ) + γ∂µ(cid:16)√−gτ µ(cid:17)
= √−gγΨ(ϕ) + γh∂0(cid:16)√−gτ 0(cid:17) + ∂i(cid:16)√−gτ i(cid:17)i ,

(29)

adjustment even in a curved space-time. For instance, in a curved space-time, in case of the
absence of b − c ghosts the Lagrangian density (12) becomes

where at the second equality we have used a formula ∇µ(√−gAµ) = ∂µ(√−gAµ), which holds

for an arbitrary vector ﬁeld Aµ. From the last expression, it is easy to see that this Lagrangian
density in the curved space-time is invariant under gauge transformations

δτ 0 = −

1

√−g

∂iξi,

δτ i =

∂0ξi,

1

√−g

(30)

where ξi are three gauge parameters. These gauge transformations are the natural extension
of Eq.
(22) to a curved space-time. Because of these gauge symmetries and the general
covariance, we can set τ µ = ∇µθ. Along the same line of argument as in the case of a ﬂat
Minkowski space-time, it turns out that the resultant BRST transformation agrees with that
of (10).

4 Cosmological solutions

In this section, we work with the action (11) of a topological quantum ﬁeld theory to de-
rive various cosmological solutions as classical solutions in the framework of the Friedmann-
Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe with spacially ﬂat metric. This derivation suggests not
only that the topological action (11) is equivalent to that of general relativity with matter
but also that it can be applied to cosmology.

In particular, we will present two types of classical solutions. One of them is the classical
solution which is a natural generalization found in our previous paper [15] where the Hubble
parameter is a constant. This type of the solution describes the inﬂation universe. The other
solution exists only when a scalar matter is coupled to gravity and is characterized by the
fact that the Hubble parameter explicitly depends on the time variable. In this case, as in
general relativity with a scalar matter, the solution describes various cosmological solutions,
which involve, for instance, an acceleratingly expanding universe like the present universe.

Before doing that, let us ﬁrst notice that using the gauge symmetries (30) which exist for
each vector ﬁeld τ µ, ωµ, ρµ, one can set spacial components of each vector ﬁeld to be vanishing:

τi = ωi = ρi = 0.

(31)

Moreover, as in the conventional approach of cosmology, one assumes that a scalar ﬁeld φ as
well as the time component of the above vector ﬁelds depend on only the time variable t:

φ = φ(t),

τ0 = τ0(t), ω0 = ω0(t),

ρ0 = ρ0(t).

(32)

8

Next, having the cosmological application of the model at hand in mind, let us work with the
FRW metric with spacially ﬂat metric (k = 0)

ds2 = gµν dxµdxν = −dt2 + a(t)2(dx2 + dy2 + dz2),

(33)

with a(t) being the scale factor.

We are now ready to turn our attention to ﬁnding classical solutions to ﬁeld equations,
which are obtained from the topological action (11). We ﬁrst attempt to search for a classical
solution such that the Hubble parameter is a mere constant. Variation with respect to the
vector ﬁelds τ µ, ωµ, ρµ yields Eqs. (6), from which we have the classical solution (7). In what
follows, among any values of constants, we will take the speciﬁc value (8) to have an exact
correspondence with general relativity. Field equations for the ghosts and the antighosts
satisfy the same form of equations

∇µ∇µc(i) = ∇µ∇µb(i) = 0.

(34)

Since the ghosts and the antighosts carry non-zero ghost numbers, we simply take c(i) = b(i) =
0 as the classical solution in this paper.

The Einstein equations, which stem from variation with respect to the metric tensor gµν,

read

2γGµν − 2(cid:16)∇µ∇νγ − gµν∇2γ(cid:17)

where Gµν = Rµν − 1
2 gµνR is the Einstein tensor and the round bracket indicates the sym-
metrization of indices of weight 1
In deriving this
equation, it is useful to rewrite the action (11) by integrating by parts. With the solution (8)
and the vanishing ghosts and antighosts, the Einstein equations (35) take the standard form

2 such as A(µBν) = 1

2 (AµBν + AνBµ).

Gµν + Λgµν = 8πGT (φ)

where the energy-momentum tensor on the RHS is deﬁned as

Using the Bianchi identity in Eq. (36), we have the conservation law

∇µT (φ)

µν = 0.

(38)

For later convenience, it is useful to introduce two quantities

ρφ =

pφ =

1
2
1
2

˙φ2 + V (φ),

˙φ2 − V (φ).

(39)

It turns out that with the metric ansatz (33), the Einstein’s equations (36) give us two

sets of the independent equations

3H 2 − Λ = 8πGρφ,
−(cid:16)3H 2 + 2 ˙H(cid:17) + Λ = 8πGpφ.

Adding the two equations, we have

−2 ˙H = 8πG ˙φ2.

(40)

(41)

If we wish to obtain a solution where the Hubble parameter H(t) is a constant, this equation
requires us to choose

where ¯H is a certain constant deﬁned as

H(t) = ¯H, φ(t) = ¯φ,

¯H =

1

3qΛ + 8πGV ( ¯φ),

(42)

(43)

and ¯φ is some constant which is commented shortly. Incidentally, the conservation law of the
energy-momentum tensor of the scalar ﬁeld φ, Eq. (38), is then identically satisﬁed since this
equation is not independent of the Einstein equations and can be derived from Eq. (40).

With the metric ansatz (33), Eq. (5), which is obtained by taking variation of the Lagrange

multiplier ﬁelds, takes the form

6(cid:16)2H 2 + ˙H(cid:17) = ˙τ0 + 3Hτ0,

˙ω0 + 3Hω0 = 1,

pφ = ˙ρ0 + 3Hρ0.

Since the present solution satisﬁes Eq. (42), a simple solution reads

τ0 = 4 ¯H, ω0 =

1
3 ¯H

,

ρ0 = −

1
3 ¯H

V ( ¯φ).

Finally, with the metric ansatz (33), variation of φ leads to

¨φ + 3H ˙φ + V ′(φ) = 0.

10

(44)

(45)

(46)

With φ = ¯φ, where ¯φ is a certain constant, this equation provides us with a restriction on ¯φ

V ′( ¯φ) = 0.

(47)

Eq. (47) tells us that φ = ¯φ is not a mere constant but really an extremum of the potential
V (φ) whose existence is assumed in this paper. In this way, we have derived the classical
solution, which is given by (7), (8), (42), (43), and (45) in addition to vanishing ghosts and
antighosts. With this classical solution, the scale factor takes the form a(t) = a(0)e ¯Ht, which
describes the inﬂation universe.

Next, let us look for a classical solution having the time-dependent Hubble parameter. In
this case, we also consider a solution given by (7), (8), and vanishing ghosts and antighosts.
Furthermore, for simplicity, we set the cosmological constant to be zero, i.e., Λ = 0.

We shall ﬁrst begin by solving the conservation law Eq. (38), which is of form

˙ρφ + 3Hρφ (1 + wφ) = 0,

(48)

where we have deﬁned wφ = pφ
and we will henceforth assume wφ to be a constant as in the
ρφ
conventional approach of cosmology. Then, it is straightforward to solve the equation (48)
for ρφ whose expression is

The Einstein equations are again given by Eq. (40), and together with the present as-

sumption Λ = 0 and Eq. (49), they are simply solved to

ρφ ∝ a(t)−3(1+wφ).

Note that as promised, in this solution, the Hubble parameter is dependent on the time
variable t.

The remaining equations to be solved are the constraint equations (5) and ﬁeld equation
(46) for the scalar ﬁeld φ. For the last equation, the behavior of the scalar ﬁeld φ depends on
the form of the potential V (φ), and since we do not specify a concrete form of the potential,
we proceed by simply assuming the existence of a scalar ﬁeld which satisﬁes the ﬁeld equation
(46). Note that this assumption for the scalar ﬁeld is usually adopted in cosmology whenever
we consider the equation of state wφ = pφ
ρφ

with wφ being a constant.

An important step for checking the presence of a classical solution is to ﬁnd the solution
satisfying the equations (5). We will present the procedure of solving the equation, R =
−∇µτ µ in detail below.
As in Eq. (31), we can put τi to be zero by the gauge symmetries (30), and regard τ0 as
an independent function which depends on only the time variable t, that is, τ0 = τ0(t). As
seen in Eq. (40), the Einstein equations together with the conservation law give rise to the
form of the Hubble parameter and its time derivative

˙H = −4πG (1 + wφ) ρφ.

(51)

Since we have R = 6(2H 2 + ˙H) and ∇µτ µ = − ˙τ0 − 3Hτ0 in the metric ansatz (33), the ﬁeld
equation R = −∇µτ µ can be rewritten as

˙τ0 + 3Hτ0 = 8πG (1 − 3wφ) ρφ.

(52)

The time dependence of τ0(t) can be expressed in terms of only the Hubble parameter H(t),
so we can put

τ0(t) = AH(t)α,

(53)

where both A and α are constants. Calculating the LHS of Eq. (52) with the help of (51)
and (53), we ﬁnd that

˙τ0 + 3Hτ0 = 4πGA(cid:18)8πG

In a perfectly similar way, one can ﬁnd the solution for ω0, ρ0

(57)

Two remarks about our solution are in order. First, for wφ = −1, the conservation law
(48) shows that ρφ is a constant, thereby the Hubble parameter becoming a constant given
by H = ¯H = q 8πG
3 ρφ. Then the scale factor has the exponential behavior a(t) ∝ e ¯Ht, which
means the inﬂation universe. The second remark is that for −1 < wφ < − 1
3 the scale factor
in (50) shows that the universe is an acceleratingly expanding one like the present universe.
It is of interest to see that in this range of wφ, the solution (57) is non-singular.

5 Dynamical mechanism for ﬁxing Lagrange multiplier

ﬁelds

Thus far, we have selected speciﬁc values (8) among arbitrary constants by hand, which is
obviously an unwelcome feature in the present approach. It is desirable that we can pick up
the values (8) through some dynamical mechanism.

12

To clarify the issue to some degree, it is useful to take account of the partition function

of the topological quantum ﬁeld theory, which is given by

Z = Z DgµνDφDγDλDβDτ µDωµDρµDb(i)Dc(i) eiST

= Z DgµνDφD¯γD¯λD ¯β [det(∇µ∇µ)]3 eiR d4x√−g{¯γR+¯λ+ ¯β[− 1

2 gµν∇µφ∇ν φ−V (φ)]},

(58)

where ¯γ, ¯λ, ¯β are constant modes. Though we have picked up the speciﬁc values (8) for these
constants, as can be seen in the partition function (58), there are in principle no preferred
values for such constants, so the real problem is how to pick up these physically plausible vaules
through some dynamical mechanism in the framework of quantum ﬁeld theories. Another
annoying problem, which is also manifest in the partition function (58), is the presence of the
determinant factor coming from the ghosts.

It might be premature to present one solution to overcome the above problems, but never-
theless we cannot help presenting it for future developments of the approach at hand. A toy
model in a ﬂat Minkowski space-time again provides us with a useful playground for proposing
our idea

L = γ [Ψ(ϕ) + ∂µτ µ] +

τµτ µ −

f

4 (cid:16)γ2 − ¯γ2(cid:17)2

(59)

where f is a coupling constant. Note that in order to avoid the problem of the topological
ghost determinant, we have worked with not a topological ﬁeld theory but a pure bosonic
theory. Also note that we have added the quadratic term of the vector ﬁeld τ µ and the Higgs
potential for the scalar ﬁeld γ to trigger the spontaneous symmetry breakdown.
Now, integrating over the vector ﬁeld τ µ exactly gives us an eﬀective theory

L = γΨ(ϕ) −

∂µγ∂µγ −

f

4 (cid:16)γ2 − ¯γ2(cid:17)2

(60)

which is the standard Lagrangian density of the scalar ﬁeld with the Higgs potential except
the ﬁrst term. Thus, at the leading order, hγi = ¯γ where hγi means the vacuum expectation
value, the Lagrangian density (60) simply takes the form

L = ¯γΨ(ϕ).

(61)

In this way, we can reach a theory with a ﬁxed value ¯γ for the scalar ﬁeld γ via the spontaneous
symmetry breakdown.

Armed with this toy model, we are now ready to present the full Lagrangian density for

the present theory

6 Conclusion

In this article, motivated with unimodular gravity [16]-[29], we have developed a new type
of induced gravity. In unimodular gravity [16]-[29], the cosmological constant emerges as an
integration constant which is unrelated to parameters existing in the original action whereas
in our induced gravity, the Newton constant, the cosmological constant and the coeﬃcient
in front of the matter action appear as integration constants. This physically intriguing
phenomenon is utilized to generate general relativity with matter ﬁeld by starting with the
induced gravity and solving its ﬁeld equations at the classical level. In our approach, we have
never appealed to quantum ﬂuctuations of matter (or gauge ﬁeld) to create the dynamics
of general relativity and matter. We therefore think that our induced gravity is a natural
counterpart in a local ﬁeld theory for the pregeometrical approach of string ﬁeld theory.

Moreover, we have advocated our original idea such that the induced gravity made in
this article is closely connected with a topological quantum ﬁeld theory. To do so, we have
analysed the constraint system of the induced gravity in the canonical formalism in detail,
and shown that in order to nullify a ghost ﬁeld existing in this theory, a topological symmetry
plays a critical role and the induced gravity must be deformed into a topological quantum
ﬁeld theory. It is worthwhile to stress that the topological symmetry is needed to make a
physically consistent theory in a natural way.

We have also examined classical solutions, which satisfy all the ﬁeld equations of the
topological quantum ﬁeld theory obtained from the induced gravity. It is clariﬁed that not
only the inﬂation universe but also the acceleratingly expanding universe can emerge as
classical solutions.

In this article, we have treated with the metric tensor ﬁeld as a ﬁxed classical background
ﬁeld along the spirit of the induced gravity, but it might be interesting to regard the metric
tensor as a quantized ﬁeld as well and study its physical implications. 6

There are many of problems to be clariﬁed in future. One of the most important problems
is to undestand the quantum eﬀects of the present theory. In particular, we have conﬁned

ourselves to only the leading-order treatment of spontaneous symmetry breaking in Section
5, so we must take the quantum ﬂuctuations around the vacuum expectation values into con-
sideration. Another more diﬃcult problem is of course to study the well-known cosmological
constant problem within the present formalism. We wish to return these problems in near
future.
