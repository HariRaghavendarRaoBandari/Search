The ferrimagnetic spinel Mn3O4 exhibits large and anisotropic changes in electronic and struc-
tural properties in response to an applied magnetic ﬁeld. These changes are thought to result
from the ﬁeld-dependent tuning—via strong spin-lattice coupling—between two nearly degenerate
magnetostructural phases. Recent variable-magnetic-ﬁeld studies of Mn3O4 have been performed
on melt-grown crystals, which can exhibit twin domains due to a Jahn-Teller structural transition
below the melting temperature. Because of the near degeneracy of the magnetostructural phases,
however, strain associated with the twin domains likely aﬀects the magnetic responses of Mn3O4.
In this report, we present a variable-magnetic-ﬁeld Raman scattering study of untwinned Mn3O4
crystals grown out of a ﬂux below the Jahn-Teller structural transition. We measure distinct q = 0
magnetic and vibrational excitation spectra for each isolated magnetostructural phase of untwinned
Mn3O4 crystals and determine the symmetries of the observed excitations. We determine how the
magnetostructural phase mixture changes in response to magnetic ﬁelds applied in the magnetic
easy plane. Lastly, by comparing results on ﬂux- and melt-grown Mn3O4 crystals, we show that the
intrinsic mixture of the two magnetostructural phases is indeed strongly inﬂuenced by the presence
of twin domains.

INTRODUCTION

Strongly correlated materials are characterized by a
competition among multiple important interactions in-
volving spin, charge, lattice, and orbital degrees of free-
dom, which often leads to a near degeneracy between
competing phases.1 Signiﬁcant consequences of this near
degeneracy include the coexistence of phases and/or the
‘colossal’ tunability of physical properties in response
to external perturbations such as magnetic ﬁeld and
pressure.2–6 Examples of such tunable properties include
multiferroic behavior,7 colossal magnetoresistance,8 mag-
netically tuned shape-memory eﬀects,9,10 and magne-
tothermal and magnetodielectric behavior.11–13 Clarify-
ing the mechanisms connecting nearly degenerate phases
and tunable behavior in speciﬁc materials has been one of
the key challenges of condensed matter physics in recent
years.

The spinel crystal structure (chemical formula AB2X4)
is a commonly occurring structure among complex transi-
tion metal oxides and chalcogenides.14 Many spinels dis-
play strong correlations between spin, charge, orbital,
and lattice degrees of freedom due to a magnetically
frustrating sublattice of corner-sharing tetrahedra (see
Fig. 1(a)), as well as the anisotropy and spatial ex-
tent of the d orbitals. Consequently, a wide variety
of phenomena have been reported for spinels, including
superconductivity,15 charge ordering,16 heavy fermion
behavior,17 and multiferroicity.18–22
The ferrimagnetic spinel Mn3O4 (A = Mn2+, B =
Mn3+, X = O2−) also exhibits novel phenomena in the
magnetically-ordered state, including large magnetodi-
electric and magnetoelastic responses.13,23,24 Magnetic-
ﬁeld-induced changes in the low-frequency dielectric con-
stant and crystal dimensions have been attributed to

ﬁeld-induced transitions between two distinct magne-
tostructural phases, which are discussed below.24 A high-
resolution x-ray diﬀraction study recently revealed that
these two magnetostructural phases in fact coexist be-
low the N´eel temperature in polycrystalline Mn3O4,25
demonstrating the near degeneracy of their free energies.
Thus, Mn3O4 belongs to the class of strongly correlated
materials whose bulk physical parameters are ‘tunable’
due to distinct phases existing in close proximity.

Mn3O4 is a tetragonally-distorted spinel at room tem-
perature as a result of a Jahn-Teller cubic-to-tetragonal
transition at T = 1440 K.26 Mn3O4 ﬁrst magnetically or-
ders at T = 42 K in a triangular conﬁguration, with the
spins lying approximately in the (100) plane and with the
net magnetization along the [010] direction,27,28 where
the crystallographic indices here and throughout the pa-
per refer to the conventional (body-) centered-tetragonal
setting. The c-axis components of the Mn3+ spins form
antiferromagnetic chains along the (cid:104)100(cid:105) directions.27 Be-
low T = 39 K, an incommensurate magnetic modulation
develops in half of the Mn3+ spins, with a propagation
vector that evolves with temperature until it becomes
commensurate with the lattice below T = 34 K, doubling
the magnetic unit cell along the [010] direction.27,28

A structural modulation with a propagation vector
identical to that of the magnetic modulation has also
been observed,24 demonstrating the strong spin-lattice
coupling in Mn3O4. This strong coupling is proposed
to originate from the geometric frustration of the Mn3+
spins, which is only partially relieved by the high-
temperature, cubic-to-tetragonal distortion.24,29 The re-
sultant exchange striction in the magnetically-ordered
state leads to a cell-doubled-orthorhombic (CDO) struc-
ture whose modulation is of the form pictured in Fig. 1(b)
below T = 34 K.

growth conditions.

Crystals of Mn3O4 are often grown out of a melt
(Tmelt > 1800 K); however, such crystals may display
twin domains due to the T = 1440 K cubic-to-tetragonal
transition in this material.31,32 The strains near twin do-
main walls may lead to a partial FCO transition, al-
though this issue has yet to be explored in crystals of
Mn3O4. Furthermore, the misalignment of twin domains
prevents an external magnetic ﬁeld from creating a ho-
mogeneous state. In spectroscopic studies, this inhomo-
geneity obscures the identiﬁcation of excitations associ-
ated with speciﬁc magnetostructural phases.

In this report, we grow untwinned crystals of Mn3O4
from a ﬂux at T = 1370 K,
i.e., below the cubic-
to-tetragonal transition. This allows us to study the
characteristic magnons and phonons associated with
each magnetostructural phase of Mn3O4 using Raman
spectroscopy—a high-resolution (∆E < 0.25 meV) probe
of the energies and symmetries of excitations in materi-
als. We are able to isolate the CDO and FCO phases of
Mn3O4 by applying an external magnetic ﬁeld along the
[010] and [110] directions, respectively, and we report the
distinct q = 0 Raman spectrum of each phase. We ﬁnd
that the number of modes and the polarization selection
rules observed in each phase support the descriptions of
the CDO and FCO phases discussed above. Finally, we
obtain Raman spectra of twinned Mn3O4 crystals, grown
from a melt for comparison, and we ﬁnd that twin do-
mains do indeed increase the FCO phase fraction present
at low temperatures.

II. EXPERIMENT

A. Sample preparation

Following the work of Nielsen,31 untwinned single crys-
tals of Mn3O4 were grown at the University of Illinois
using a ﬂux method. Commercial powders of man-
ganese(II,III) oxide (Alfa-Aesar, 99.997%) and anhy-
drous sodium tetraborate (‘Borax’, Alfa-Aesar, 99.5%)
were combined in a one-to-one molar ratio, wet milled un-
der ethanol for 12 hours using a FRITSCH Pulverisette
P6 planetary ball mill, and dried in air at 150 ◦C to re-
move the ethanol. To control vaporization loss of Borax
at high temperatures, the ‘crystalline seal’ method devel-
oped by Wanklyn was used.33 A double crucible was ﬁlled
with the milled Mn3O4-Borax powder and the top was
loosely sealed with a crimped-on lid. The double crucible
was heated in a Lindberg/Blue box furnace to 1100 ◦C
over 10 hours, held at that temperature for 2 hours,
cooled to 900 ◦C over 12 hours, and then decanted as
a standard ‘hot-pour’. The Mn3O4-Borax mixture that
sealed the two crucibles together was dissolved by soak-
ing the mixture alternately in deionized water and hy-
drochloric acid.

The untwinned Mn3O4 crystals were characterized
with magnetization and heat capacity measurements

It is known that structural and magnetic symmetry
changes in Mn3O4 can be induced with modest mag-
netic ﬁelds applied in the (001) plane (magnetic easy
plane).10,24,30 For example, cooling a sample in the
presence of a H = 1 T magnetic ﬁeld applied along
the [110] direction drives a uniform orthorhombic dis-
tortion of the lattice via spin-orbit coupling and in-
verse exchange striction.24 The resultant face-centered-
orthorhombic (FCO) structure is proposed to be of the
form pictured in Fig. 1(c).

Interestingly, there have been varying reports of partial
or complete transitions to FCO symmetry at low temper-
atures even in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, leading to
phase coexistence. In single crystals of Mn3O4, Chung et
al. report an instability along the [110] axis, leading to a
partial FCO distortion,29 and Kim et al. report a com-
plete transformation to FCO symmetry.30 Furthermore,
in a study of polycrystalline Mn3O4, Kemei et al. report a
>50% FCO phase fraction at low temperatures and pro-
pose that a partial FCO transition is intrinsic and may
be governed by internal strains.25 These varying results
raise questions regarding how the ground state properties
of Mn3O4 are aﬀected by twin domains, impurities, and
other structural properties inﬂuenced by speciﬁc crystal

(b) CDO(c) FCO[010][100]Mn3+(a)[100][010][001](data shown in Appendix A), which show magnetic tran-
sitions at T = 42, 40, and 34 K, in good agreement with
published data.27,28 The crystallographic orientations of
the samples used in this experiment were determined via
x-ray diﬀraction measurements performed at room tem-
perature.
The resultant crystals are long, thin parallelepipeds,
with approximate dimensions 1 × 1 × 5 mm. The large
crystal facets are parallel to (101) and (011) planes, while
the long axis is parallel to the [¯1¯11] direction. The facets
occasionally display visible faults, and x-ray diﬀraction
reveals that there are two twin domains present in these
crystals. The twins are related by a π rotation about the
long axis, and optical polarization studies conﬁrm that
the faults separate the two diﬀerent crystallographic ori-
entations. The same type of twinning has previously been
observed on a microscopic scale in Mn3O4 grown at tem-
peratures above the cubic-to-tetragonal transition.34 The
twin domains of the ﬂux-grown crystals studied in this
report are macroscopic (several mm in size) and much
larger than the laser spot size (∼ 50 µm) used in the
Raman scattering experiments performed here. Conse-
quently, we were able to obtain Raman spectra from
single-domain regions of these samples; we therefore refer
to these crystals as ‘untwinned’ or ‘single-domain’ crys-
tals.

For comparison, microscopically twinned crystals of
Mn3O4 were grown from a melt using a ﬂoating-zone
method described by Kim et al.30 The structural and
magnetic properties of the resulting crystals are reported
elsewhere.10,30,35 The crystals exhibit three magnetic
transitions at T = 43, 39, and 33 K, consistent with previ-
ously reported temperatures.27,28 These samples did not
exhibit polarization selection rules in Raman scattering
measurements, indicating that the twin domains in these
samples are smaller than the laser spot size (∼ 50 µm)
used in the Raman scattering experiments; we therefore
refer to these crystals as ‘twinned’ crystals.

B. Raman scattering measurements

Raman scattering measurements were performed us-
ing the 647.1 nm excitation line of a krypton ion laser.
The incident laser power was limited to 10 mW and was
focused to a ∼ 50-µm diameter spot to minimize laser
heating of the sample, which was estimated to be roughly
4 K. The scattered light from the samples was collected
in a backscattering geometry, dispersed through a triple-
stage spectrometer, and detected with a liquid-nitrogen-
cooled CCD detector. The incident light polarization was
selected with a polarization rotator, and the scattered
light polarization was analyzed with a linear polarizer,
providing symmetry information about the excitations
studied. The samples were inserted into a continuous
He-ﬂow cryostat, which was horizontally mounted in the
open bore of a superconducting magnet, allowing Raman
measurements in the temperature range 4 ≤ T ≤ 300 K

and the magnetic ﬁeld range 0 ≤ H ≤ 6 T.

FIG. 2. (Color online) Raman scattering geometries used in
variable-magnetic-ﬁeld measurements. Each geometry speci-
ﬁes the magnetic ﬁeld orientation and scattering plane.

Three diﬀerent scattering geometries were employed
in the variable-magnetic-ﬁeld measurements (see Fig. 2).
Each geometry shown in Fig. 2 speciﬁes the magnetic
ﬁeld orientation and the plane containing the incident-
and scattered-light polarizations (scattering plane). Ge-
ometry 1 (Fig. 2, left) utilizes the as-grown crystal face,
which presents a (101) (or, equivalently, (011)) surface,
and contains a [010] ([100]) axis. A magnetic ﬁeld was ap-
plied in the scattering plane along the [010] ([100]) direc-
tion. The [010] and [100] directions become magnetically
inequivalent in the magnetically-ordered state, with [010]
labeling the magnetization direction by convention.27 Ac-
cordingly, when a suﬃciently large magnetic ﬁeld is ap-
plied along the [010] ([100]) axis to form a single magnetic
domain,36 we refer to that direction as the [010] direction.
Crystals were also cut and polished to present a face
normal to the [110] (or, equivalently, [1¯10]) direction. A
magnetic ﬁeld was applied either along the normal of the
scattering plane (Geometry 2; see Fig. 2, middle) or in
the scattering plane along the [¯110] ([110]) direction (Ge-
ometry 3; see Fig. 2, right). It is known that a suﬃciently
large magnetic ﬁeld applied along the [110] ([¯110]) axis
in the magnetically ordered state causes these directions
to become magnetically and structurally inequivalent, as
the crystal elongates along the direction of the applied
magnetic ﬁeld.24 We refer to this elongated direction as
the [110] direction.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Room-temperature phonon spectra

Figure 3 presents the T = 300 K Raman spectra of
an untwinned Mn3O4 crystal taken with various polar-
izations of the incident and scattered light. We observe
seven of the ten Raman-active phonons predicted by a
group theoretical analysis of the Mn3O4 crystal structure
using the D4h point group. The presence of polarization
selection rules indicate well-deﬁned crystallographic axes,
as expected of an untwinned crystal, and the phonons
exhibit symmetries consistent with the D4h point group.

above vertical, dashed lines that indicate the phonon peak

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst experimental determi-
nation of the Mn3O4 phonon symmetries.

In addition to demonstrating the absence of twinning
in the crystals studied here, the phonon symmetry analy-
sis in Fig. 3 shows for the ﬁrst time that the large tetrag-
onal distortion from cubic symmetry (c/a = 1.16
2) is
manifest in the phonon Raman spectra. For example,
we observe a 54 cm−1 (6.75 meV) splitting between the
ω = 320 cm−1 A1g and ω = 374 cm−1 B2g phonons at
room temperature; these modes are expected to be de-
generate above the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition
at T = 1440 K.37

B. Temperature-dependent excitation spectra

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the
untwinned Mn3O4 Raman spectrum (a) in the 50 ≤
ω ≤ 185 cm−1 energy range, (b) near the 295 cm−1 Eg
phonon, and (c) in the 325 ≤ ω ≤ 365 cm−1 energy
range. There are three salient developments in Fig. 4
for T < 32 K: (1) Eight new peaks develop in the low-
energy range ω < 170 cm−1, which we attribute to one-
magnon excitations following the analysis of Gleason et
al.38 (2) Two new phonon peaks appear at ω = 342 cm−1
and ω = 351 cm−1, whose energies and intensities are
consistent with optical phonon modes that have been

velops additional structure, indicating a change in the
crystal lattice structure discussed further below.

The ﬁrst two features oﬀer strong conﬁrmation that
simultaneous cell-doubling modulations of the magnetic
and structural lattices develop below T = 32 K. Previ-
ous studies of Mn3O4 observed the appearance of both
magnetic24,27 and nuclear24 superlattice reﬂections at
(h k+ 1
2 0) for integer h, k when T < 34 K. Figure 4
shows that, for T < 32 K, there is indeed a concomi-
tant development of more than six magnon peaks and
two new phonon peaks—consistent with enlarged mag-
netic and structural unit cells. These data provide direct
spectroscopic evidence of simultaneous doubling of the
magnetic and nuclear unit cells.

To clarify the last feature of Fig. 4 concerning a change
in the crystal lattice for T < 32 K, we performed a po-
larization analysis of the magnetic and vibrational ex-
citations. The full details of the symmetry analysis are
given in Appendix B, and the experimentally determined
energies and symmetries of the observed excitations are
tabulated in Table I. Figure 5 shows representative spec-
tra from this study. The symmetry selection rules exhib-
ited by the phonon and magnon modes in Fig. 5 indicate
that the low-temperature, zero-ﬁeld-cooled phase of un-
twinned Mn3O4 has orthorhombic symmetry with a, b,
and c axes along the [100], [010], and [001] directions,
respectively.

C. Magnetic-ﬁeld-dependent excitation spectra

Previous studies10,24,30 have shown that an applied
magnetic ﬁeld can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the crystal lat-
tice of Mn3O4, and that the structural response depends
on the orientation of the applied ﬁeld. For example, a
recent x-ray and neutron scattering study by Nii et al.
reported that a magnetic ﬁeld applied along the [110]
direction stabilizes the FCO phase with a, b, and c axes
along the [1¯10], [110], and [001] directions, respectively.24
Additionally, no satellite peaks were observed in neu-
tron and x-ray diﬀraction measurements of the FCO
phase, indicating the structural and magnetic modula-
tions are absent in this phase.24 Our spectroscopic stud-
ies of untwinned Mn3O4 allow a further elucidation of the
magnetic-ﬁeld-induced phases of Mn3O4, by allowing us
to study simultaneously the magnetic and phonon excita-
tion spectra while applying a magnetic ﬁeld along well-
deﬁned crystallographic directions. We will ﬁrst show
that a magnetic ﬁeld applied along the [110] direction
does indeed lead to a transition to the FCO magne-
tostructural phase. Next, we will show that a magnetic
ﬁeld applied along the [010] direction preserves the CDO
magnetostructural phase. However, we will also show
that reversing the magnetic ﬁeld from [010] to [0¯10] in-
duces a CDO→FCO→CDO transition.

1. H (cid:107) [110]: face-centered-orthorhombic phase

Figure 6 shows the magnetic-ﬁeld dependence of the
Raman spectrum in the energy ranges 50 ≤ ω ≤
185 cm−1 and 285 ≤ ω ≤ 305 cm−1 for a magnetic
ﬁeld applied along the [110] direction measured in (a),(b)
Geometry 2 and (c),(d) Geometry 3 at T = 8 K. The
two scattering geometries are employed to allow the ob-
servation of nearly all of the Raman-active modes. For
all measurements, the sample was zero-ﬁeld-cooled from
room temperature to T = 8 K before a magnetic ﬁeld was
applied. The resulting H = 0 T and T = 8 K Raman
spectra (bottom curves in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)) are consis-
tent with the CDO phase, as discussed in §III B.40 When
H (cid:107) [110], as the magnetic ﬁeld magnitude is increased,
the spectra in Fig. 6 change dramatically in the range
0 ≤ H ≤ 1 T, indicating a magnetostructural phase tran-
sition. No further changes in the spectra are observed for
1 < H ≤ 6 T (data not shown). We show below that the
phase stabilized for H > 1 T with H (cid:107) [110] is consistent
with the FCO phase, in agreement with the results of Nii
et al.24
To verify the FCO symmetry of the magnetostructural
phase for H > 1 T and H (cid:107) [110], we performed a polar-
ization study of the magnetic and vibrational excitations
in this phase regime. The full details of the symmetry
analysis are given in Appendix B, and the experimentally
determined energies and symmetries of the observed ex-
citations are tabulated in Table I. Fig. 7 shows represen-
tative spectra from this study. The broad, asymmetric

tent with the modulation of the Mn3+
tetrahedra pro-
posed by Nii et al. and illustrated in Fig. 1(b).24 We
note that the displacement pattern shown in Fig. 1(b)
removes the twofold rotations about the [110] and [¯110]
axes, as well as any mirror operations in planes orthog-
onal to these directions. On the other hand, the twofold
rotations about the [100] and [010] axes are preserved (up
to a fractional translation, in the case of the [010] axis).

We clearly resolve three non-degenerate phonons near
295 cm−1 in the CDO phase (see Fig. 5(b)), including a
B3g mode (ω = 295 cm−1) and two B2g modes (ω = 293
and 298 cm−1). The tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transi-
tion is expected to split the ω = 295 cm−1 Eg phonon into
a B3g phonon and a single B2g phonon. The presence of
a second B2g phonon is associated with a phonon mode
that has been folded to q = 0 because of the structural
modulation for T < 32 K, similar to the folded phonon
modes at ω = 342 and 351 cm−1 discussed previously.

Based on the number of modes we observe and their
respective polarization selection rules, we conclude that
untwinned Mn3O4 transitions to the CDO phase depicted
in Fig. 1(b) for T < 32 K in the absence of a magnetic
ﬁeld. An explanation for reports of partial or complete
transitions to an FCO phase at low temperatures is given
in §III D.

along the [1¯10], [110], and [001] directions, respectively.
These new high-symmetry axes can be understood by
examining the displacement pattern proposed by Nii et
al.24 and depicted in Fig. 1(c). The uniform distortion of
the Mn3+
tetrahedra removes the twofold rotational sym-
metry about the [100] and [010] axes, as well as the mir-
ror operations in planes orthogonal to these directions.
On the other hand, the lattice depicted in Fig. 1(c) pos-
sesses twofold rotational symmetry about the [110] and
[¯110] directions, which is consistent with the selection
rules we observe. Furthermore, the splitting between the
two normal modes near 295 cm−1 is ∼ 11 cm−1 in the
FCO phase, which is ∼ 4 times larger than the split-
ting between the equivalent modes in the CDO phase.
As this splitting reﬂects the loss of fourfold symmetry
in the (001) plane, a larger splitting in the FCO phase
makes sense, given the more pronounced asymmetry be-
tween the in-plane, high-symmetry directions caused by
the uniform distortion of the crystal.

To complete the characterization of the FCO phase, we
examined the folded optical phonons, which are a signa-
ture of the structural cell-doubling modulation. Figure 8
shows the magnetic-ﬁeld dependence of (a) the phonon
spectrum in the 285 ≤ ω ≤ 305 cm−1 energy range and

spectrum of untwinned Mn3O4 (bottom curve) is char-
acteristic of the CDO phase.40

As the magnetic ﬁeld is increased to H = 1 T, the spec-
trum does not change appreciably. Moreover, no signiﬁ-
cant changes are observed in the spectrum for magnetic
ﬁelds up to H = 6 T (data not shown). We conclude
that the CDO phase is stable for a magnetic ﬁeld applied
along the [010] direction in Mn3O4.

Previous Raman scattering studies by Kim et al. re-
ported that an FCO phase can be stabilized for magnetic
ﬁelds applied in the (001) plane.10,30 Indeed, our phonon
Raman data are qualitatively similar to those of Kim et
al.41 However, Kim et al. reported that the FCO phase is
stabilized for an H > 3 T magnetic ﬁeld oriented either
along or orthogonal to the easy axis direction ([010]),10,30
which conﬂicts with the results in §III C 1 and §III C 2
of this paper. Our results, as well as the results of Nii
et al.,24 suggest that magnetic ﬁelds that stabilized the
FCO phase in refs. [10] and [30] were actually along the
[¯110] or [110] directions. This discrepancy likely results
from an inconsistent use of both face-centered-tetragonal
and body-centered-tetragonal settings when describing
crystallographic orientations in refs. [10] and [30].

T = 8 K taken in Geometry 2 (see §II B) at various magnetic
ﬁelds in the energy ranges (a) 285 − 305 cm−1 and (b) 325 −
365 cm−1. The data have been oﬀset for clarity.

(b) the folded phonons near 342 cm−1 and 351 cm−1 for
H (cid:107) [110] and T = 8 K. As discussed above, the H = 0 T
phonon and magnon spectra of untwinned Mn3O4 be-
low T = 32 K are indicative of the CDO phase.40 When
H (cid:107) [110], the intensities of the folded phonons diminish
with increasing magnetic ﬁeld. For H > 2 T, the folded
phonon modes vanish as the FCO phase is stabilized, as
indicated by the appearance of the ω = 300 cm−1 phonon
and the suppression of the ω = 293, 295, and 298 cm−1
phonons in Fig. 8(a) (compare with ﬁeld dependence in
Fig. 6(b)). This ﬁeld dependence conﬁrms that a mag-
netic ﬁeld applied along the [110] direction suppresses
the cell-doubling structural modulation in Mn3O4, con-
sistent with the results of Nii et al.24 Additionally, we
observe fewer than six magnons in the FCO phase, as
seen in Fig. 6, consistent with the number of spins in
the FCO unit cell, indicating the magnetic cell-doubling
modulation is not present in the FCO phase. These data
provide further evidence that the structural and mag-
netic cell-doubling modulations are absent in the FCO
phase.

A summary of the CDO and FCO excitation spec-
tra is given in Table I, which tabulates the experimen-
tally determined energies and symmetries of the Raman-
active one-magnon and one-phonon excitations with ω ≤
300 cm−1 for the CDO and FCO phases. Each normal
mode can be assigned to an irreducible representation of
the D2h point group. The details of the analysis per-
formed are given in Appendix B.

2. H (cid:107) [010]: cell-doubled-orthorhombic phase

We next show that a magnetic ﬁeld applied along the
magnetic easy axis [010] preserves the CDO phase in
untwinned Mn3O4. Figure 9 shows the magnetic-ﬁeld
dependence of the Raman spectrum (a) in the 50 ≤
ω ≤ 185 cm−1 energy range and (b) near 295 cm−1 for
H (cid:107) [010] at T = 8 K. The sample was zero-ﬁeld-cooled
from room temperature to T = 8 K before the magnetic
ﬁeld was applied. Once again, the H = 0 T Raman

and FCO phases are marked in black and red, respectively.
The arrow indicates the sequence of ﬁeld values used. The
data have been oﬀset for clarity.

3. H (cid:107) [010]: phase hysteresis

After applying a magnetic ﬁeld along the [010] direc-
tion and subsequently reducing the ﬁeld to H = 0 T, we
occasionally found that the CDO spectrum would trans-
form to the FCO spectrum. This motivated us to per-
form a sequence of measurements in which a magnetic
ﬁeld applied along the [010] direction was cycled between
H = +0.3 and H = −0.3 T. Figure 10 shows the Raman
spectra of Mn3O4 for various ﬁelds in this sequence.

Figure 10 demonstrates that reversing a magnetic ﬁeld
along the [010] direction can dramatically inﬂuence the
phase fraction of Mn3O4. We have already identiﬁed and
attributed the H = ±0.3 T Raman spectra (marked in
black) to the CDO phase. The red spectrum observed
at H = ±0.05 T is exactly the FCO spectrum formerly
obtained by applying a H = 1 T magnetic ﬁeld along
the [110] direction, which can be seen by comparing the
peaks in this spectrum with those in the H = 1 T spectra
in Fig. 6.

Note that we previously demonstrated that a magnetic
ﬁeld along the [010] direction stabilizes the CDO phase.
Remarkably, if the magnetic ﬁeld is applied along the
[010] direction and subsequently reversed to the [0¯10]
direction, the phase fractions change dramatically near
H = 0 T. In fact, the crystal intermediately transitions
fully to the FCO phase before reverting to the CDO phase
at higher ﬁeld strengths. The ability to tune between the

CDO and FCO phases with very small magnetic ﬁelds
along the [010] direction further illustrates that the free
energies of these two phases are nearly degenerate in
Mn3O4 at T = 8 K.

D. Eﬀect of twin domains

We have identiﬁed the distinct Raman spectra of the
CDO and FCO phases of Mn3O4 at low temperatures.
The near degeneracy of these phases is evidenced by the
ability to manipulate the phase fraction at low temper-
ature with modest magnetic ﬁelds applied in the (001)
plane. Consequently,
it is likely that other parame-
ters, e.g., strain, can also inﬂuence the phase fraction of
Mn3O4. Indeed, an x-ray diﬀraction study by Kemei et
al. reported phase coexistence in polycrystalline Mn3O4
at low temperatures, which was attributed to strain aris-
ing from domain walls.25

It is well established that growth temperature con-
tributes to the presence or absence of structural domains
in crystals of Mn3O4. As discussed in §I, twin domains
can be introduced in Mn3O4 crystals by growing at tem-
peratures above the T = 1440 K cubic-to-tetragonal
Jahn-Teller transition, e.g., by growing crystals from a
melt.31,32 On the other hand, untwinned Mn3O4 crystals
can be obtained by growing at temperatures below the

(Color online) Raman scattering spectra of un-
twinned and twinned Mn3O4 crystals at T = 8 K in the
energy ranges (a) 85 − 160 cm−1 and (b) 285 − 305 cm−1.
The data have been oﬀset for clarity.

To study the eﬀect of structural domains on the low-
temperature phase fraction in Mn3O4 crystals, we com-
pared Raman scattering spectra from both untwinned
and twinned Mn3O4 crystals in the absence of a magnetic
ﬁeld. Figure 11 shows the zero-ﬁeld-cooled, T = 8 K Ra-
man spectra of multiple untwinned and twinned Mn3O4
crystals. The untwinned crystals overwhelmingly exhibit
the CDO phase, while the twinned crystals exhibit a
coexistence of both CDO and FCO phases. This indi-
cates that the low-temperature FCO phase fraction is
strongly inﬂuenced by the presence of structural domains
in Mn3O4 crystals, with structural domains promoting
the nucleation of the FCO phase.

As the anisotropic responses of the electronic and
structural properties of Mn3O4 to an applied magnetic
ﬁeld are thought to result from tuning between the CDO
and FCO phases, controlling the phase fraction via the
introduction of structural domains may present a novel
mechanism for controlling the functional behavior of
Mn3O4.

IV. SUMMARY

We performed a variable-temperature and variable-
magnetic-ﬁeld Raman scattering study of untwinned
Mn3O4 crystals. By studying untwinned crystals, we are
able to identify the distinctive q = 0 magnetic and vi-
brational Raman excitation energies and symmetries of
Mn3O4 for both the CDO and FCO phases at T = 8 K.
Our spectroscopic results for each phase support the
microscopic description of the two magnetostructural
phases given by Nii et al.24 We also report the eﬀects of
a magnetic ﬁeld applied in the (001) plane on the mag-
netostructural phase mixture of Mn3O4 at T = 8 K.

9
Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that ﬁeld orientations H (cid:107) [010]
and H (cid:107) [110] for H > 1 T select the CDO and FCO
phases, respectively, in untwinned Mn3O4. Lastly, we
compare the H = 0 T, T = 8 K Raman spectra of un-
twinned crystals to the spectra of twinned crystals of
Mn3O4. We ﬁnd that the presence of twin domains in-
creases the low-temperature phase fraction of the FCO
phase in crystals of Mn3O4. This result may explain the
varying reports of partial or complete transitions to the
FCO phase and also suggests a mechanism for control-
ling the low-temperature phase and functional behavior
of Mn3O4.

Appendix A: Sample characterization

We collected DC magnetization data using a Quan-
tum Design MPMS-3 (see Fig. 12), as well as heat ca-
pacity data using a Quantum Design PPMS-DynaCool
(see Fig. 13). Both zero-ﬁeld-cooled and ﬁeld-cooled
data are shown. The data show magnetic transitions at
T = 42, 40, and 34 K, in good agreement with published
data.27,28 The apparent 0.5 K splitting of the T = 34 K
cell-doubling transition in Fig. 13 is an artifact of the
method by which we collected our data—one peak is from
the warming part of the cycle, while the other is from the
cooling section. As discussed by Guillou et al., this is a
clear signature of a ﬁrst-order phase transition.42 It also
suggests that the quality of these crystals is high, as low-
quality, multi-grain crystals have transition temperatures
which are too smeared out to see such sharp features.

Appendix B: Polarization studies

At room temperature, the Bravais lattice of Mn3O4 is
centered tetragonal. Two equivalent conventional unit
cells are employed in the literature: a body-centered-
tetragonal cell (Fig. 14,
left) and a face-centered-
tetragonal cell (Fig. 14, right). These coordinate systems
diﬀer by a π/4 rotation about the [001] axis. In this pa-
per, we choose the body-centered-tetragonal setting as
our coordinate system.

At room temperature, the Mn3O4 crystal structure
possesses 4-fold rotational symmetry about the princi-
pal axis [001], up to a fractional translation. The crystal
structure also has two pairs of 2-fold symmetry axes in
the (001) plane: the secondary axes [100] and [010] and
the tertiary axes [¯110] and [110].

centered-orthorhombic (FCO) phase retains 2-fold sym-
metry about the [¯110] and [110] directions (see Fig. 15,
right).

Table II presents the D2h Raman tensors for each
phase with respect to the body-centered-tetragonal co-
ordinate system. Symmetric tensors were found suﬃ-
cient to describe the polarization dependences observed
for each peak’s intensity. Magnetic excitations are as-
signed to irreducible representations of the D2h point
group, rather than the monoclinic magnetic point group
reported by Jensen et al.,27 for the same reason.

The low-temperature, orthorhombic magnetostruc-
tural phases of Mn3O4, which form the subject of this
paper, are distorted such that 4-fold symmetry is lost.
Each phase retains only one pair of 2-fold symmetry
axes in the (001) plane. The cell-doubled-orthorhombic
(CDO) phase retains 2-fold symmetry about the [100]
and [010] directions (see Fig. 15,
(Because the
cell-doubling modulation present in this phase leads to a
unit cell which is not internally centered, we refer to this

left).

the [100] and [010] directions, as described previously.
The experimentally determined energies and symmetries
of the Raman-active magnetic and vibrational excitations
with ω ≤ 300 cm−1 are tabulated in Table IV. We note
that the Raman tensor of the ω = 51 cm−1 Ag mode
appears to have a (cid:39) −b, suggesting that this normal
mode originates from a B1g mode in the tetragonal (D4h)
phase.

Determining the symmetry of the ω = 56 cm−1 mag-
netic excitation is complicated by the peak at ω =
54 cm−1, which is a peak exclusive to the Raman spec-
trum of the CDO phase. To see this, note that the ω =
54 cm−1 peak has a large scattering cross-section, as seen
in Fig. 16. The nonzero peak intensity at ω = 54 cm−1 in
the FCO phase (Fig. 17) is due to the presence of a small,
remnant CDO phase fraction indicated by a nonzero peak
intensity at ω = 295 cm−1. In our analysis, we conclude
that the peak at ω = 56 cm−1 is absent in all but the
bottom two curves in Fig. 17.

39 The peak at 54 cm−1 represents an excitation of the CDO
phase with a relatively large cross-section, as seen in Fig. 5.
A nonzero peak intensity at 54 cm−1 in the FCO phase is
due to the presence of a small, remnant CDO phase frac-
tion, as evidenced by a nonzero peak intensity at 295 cm−1.
40 The weak peak at 289 cm−1 indicates a minority FCO

phase is present.
