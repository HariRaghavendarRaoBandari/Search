Abstract: Let f be an endomorphism of a vector space V over a ﬁeld
K. An f -invariant subspace X ⊆ V is called hyperinvariant (respectively
characteristic) if X is invariant under all endomorphisms (respectively auto-
morphisms) that commute with f . If |K| > 2 then all characteristic sub-
spaces are hyperinvariant. If |K| = 2 then there are endomorphisms f with
invariant subspaces that are characteristic but not hyperinvariant. In this
paper we give a new proof of a theorem of Shoda, which provides a necessary
and suﬃcient condition for the existence of characteristic non-hyperinvariant
subspaces.

Introduction

Let V be an n-dimensional vector space over a ﬁeld K and let f : V → V
be K-linear. The set of f -invariant subspaces of V form a lattice, which we
denote by Inv(V ). In this paper we are concerned with two sublattices of
Inv(V ). If a subspace X of V remains invariant for all endomorphisms of
V that commute with f then X is called hyperinvariant for f [7, p. 305].
We say [2] that a subspace X of V is characteristic for f if X ∈ Inv(V )
and α(X) = X for all K-automorphisms α of V that commute with f . Let
Hinv(V) and Chinv(V) be set of hyperinvariant and characteristic subspaces
of V , respectively. Both sets are lattices, and Hinv(V) ⊆ Chinv(V). If the
the characteristic polynomial of f splits over K (such that all eigenvalues
of f are in K) then one can reduce the study of Hinv(V) and Chinv(V) to
the case where f has only one eigenvalue, in particular to the case where f
is nilpotent. Thus, throughout this paper we shall assume f n = 0. Then
(see for example [7, p. 306]) the lattice Hinv(V) is the smallest sublattice of
Inv(V ) that contains

Ker f k, Im f k, k = 0, 1, . . . , n.

(1.1)

It is well known ([10], [12], [2]) that each characteristic subspace is hyper-
invariant if |K| > 2. In this paper we consider vector spaces V over the ﬁeld
K = GF (2) and we focus on characteristic subspaces that are not hyperin-
variant. The following example shows that in the case of K = GF (2) it may
occur that Chinv(V) ) Hinv(V). The set of endomorphisms, respectively
automorphisms, of V that commute with f will be denoted by Endf (V ),
respectively Autf (V ).
Example 1.1. Let K = GF (2) = {0, 1}. Consider V = K 4 and

f =




0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0




.

Let e1, . . . , e4, be the unit vectors of K 4. Set z = e1 + e3 = (1, 0, 1, 0)T . Then
f 2z = 0. Deﬁne X = span{z, f z}. Then

X = {0, z, f z, z + f z} = {0, e1 + e3, e4, e1 + e3 + e4} ∈ Inv (V ).

(1.2)

Note that Endf (V ) consists of all matrices of the form

g =




a b 0 0
0 c 0 0
0 d c 0
k h d c




,

(1.3)

and g ∈ Autf (V ) if and only if

g =




1 b 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 d 1 0
k h d 1




.

(1.4)

Thus, if g ∈ Autf (V ) then

gz = e1 + e3 + (k + d)e4, gf z = e4, g(z + f z) = e1 + e3 + (k + d + 1)e4.

Hence gX ⊆ X, and therefore X ∈ Chinv(V ). Let π1 = diag(1, 0, 0, 0) be the
orthogonal projection on Ke1. Then π1 ∈ Endf (V ), and we have π1z = e1,
but e1 /∈ X. Therefore X is not hyperinvariant.

The example is in accordance with the following result of Shoda [12,
Satz 5, p. 619], [9], [10, p. 63/64], which we state in terms of the Jordan
normal form of f .

Theorem 1.2. Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space over the ﬁeld
K = GF (2) and let f : V → V be nilpotent. The following statements
are equivalent.
(i) There exists a characteristic subspace of V which is not hyperinvariant.
(ii) For some numbers r and s with s > r + 1 the Jordan form of f contains
exactly one Jordan block of size s and exactly one block of size r.

It is the main purpose of this paper to give a new proof of the implication
“(i) ⇒ (ii)” of Shoda’s theorem. In order to present a complete picture we
also include a proof of the reverse implication “(ii) ⇒ (i)”. Theorem 1.3 below
plays a key role in our new proof . It relates characteristic and hyperinvariant
subspaces with marked subspaces. Recall that an f -invariant subspace W ⊆
V , W 6= 0, is said to be marked [7, p. 83] if it has a Jordan basis (with respect
to f|W ) that can be extended to a Jordan basis of V . The zero subspace is
assumed to be marked.

Theorem 1.3. [2, p. 268] Let W ∈ Inv (V ). Then W is a hyperinvariant
subspace if and only if W is characteristic and marked.

The proof of Theorem 1.2 will be divided into several parts. It relies on
results on characteristic subspaces in Section 4. Auxiliary material and basic
facts on generator tuples and marked subspaces are discussed in Section 3.

2 Deﬁnitions and notation

We set V [f j] = Ker f j, j ≥ 0. Clearly, f n = 0 implies V = V [f n]. Deﬁne
ι = idV and f 0 = ι. Let x ∈ V . The smallest nonnegative integer ℓ with
f ℓx = 0 is called the exponent of x. We write e(x) = ℓ. A nonzero vector
x is said to have height q if x ∈ f qV and x /∈ f q+1V . In this case we write
h(x) = q. We set h(0) = ∞. Let Y ⊆ V . We write e(Y ) = s if e(y) = s for all
y ∈ Y . Moreover, h(Y ) = q shall mean Y ⊆ f qV together with Y * f q+1V .
Let

hxi = span{f ix, i ≥ 0}

be the cyclic subspace generated by x. If B ⊆ V we deﬁne hBi = Pb ∈ B h b i.
We call U = (u1, . . . , uk) a generator tuple of V if

V = hu1i ⊕ · · · ⊕ huki

and if the elements of U are ordered such that

t1 = e(u1) ≤ · · · ≤ e(uk) = tk.

Let U be the set of generator tuples of V . Thus

st1, . . . , stk, 0 < t1 ≤ · · · ≤ tk,

(2.1)

(2.2)

are the elementary divisors of f , and t1 + · · · + tk = dim V = n and
dim Ker f = k. Set

.

(2.3)

Then J = diag(Nt1, . . . , Ntk ) is the Jordan form of f . We deﬁne
d(r) = dim(cid:0)V [f ] ∩ f r−1V / V [f ] ∩ f rV (cid:1), r = 1, 2, . . . , n.

Using the terminology of abelian p-groups [8] or p-modules [10, p.27] we call
d(r) the r − 1-th Ulm invariant and

D = (cid:0)d(1), . . . , d(n)(cid:1)

(2.4)

3

the Ulm sequence of the pair (V, f ). Then d(r) is equal to the number of
Jordan blocks of size r in the Jordan form J of f . If V = hxi, e(x) = n, then
D = (0, . . . , 0, 1). Thus, if V [f ] = f a−1V then D = (0, . . . , 0, n/a, 0, . . . , 0).

Let U = (u1, . . . , uk) ∈ U.

It will be convenient to partition U into
subsets of equal exponent. Denote the distinct elements of {e(ur); 1 ≤ r ≤
k} by a1, a2, . . . , am labelled so that a1 < · · · < am and set

Uaµ = {u ∈ U; e(u) = aµ}, µ = 1, . . . , m.

Then

U = (cid:0)Ua1, . . . , Uam(cid:1) and

e(Ua1) = a1 < · · · < e(Uam) = am,

(2.5)

and |Uaµ| = d(aµ). To (2.5) corresponds the decomposition

V = hUa1i ⊕ · · · ⊕ hUami.

(2.6)

Let πµ : V → V be the projection with

πµV = hUaµi, Ker πµ = hUa1, . . . , Uaµ−1, Uaµ+1, . . . , Uami.

Note that πµ ∈ Endf (V ).

3 Auxiliary results

3.1 Automorphisms and generators

The following lemma shows that each α ∈ Autf (V ) is uniquely determined
by the image of a given generator tuple.

Lemma 3.1. [2] Let U = (u1, . . . , uk) ∈ U be given. For α ∈ Autf (V )
deﬁne ΘU (α) = (cid:0)α(u1), . . . , α(uk)(cid:1). Then

α 7→ ΘU (α), ΘU : Autf (V ) → U,

is a bijection.

The next lemma will enable us to exchange vectors in a generator tuple.

Lemma 3.2. Suppose V = hu1i ⊕ · · · ⊕ huni and e(ui) = a, i = 1, . . . , n. If
x ∈ V , x 6= 0, and h(x) = 0, then there exist an index j such that

(u1, . . . , uj−1, x, uj+1, . . . , un) ∈ U.

Because of h(x) = 0 we have h(xj) = 0 for some j. Thus cj0 6= 0, and Cj is

(3.2)

The vectors

B = (u1, f u1 . . . , f a−1u1, . . . , uk, f uk . . . , f a−1un)

(3.3)

are a Jordan basis of V . Because of (3.2) we obtain another Jordan basis if
we replace the vectors (uj, f uj . . . , f a−1uj) in B by (x, f x . . . , f a−1x). This
proves (3.1).

In the proof of Theorem 4.3 we shall use the following observation.

Lemma 3.3. Let U = (Ua1, . . . , Uam) ∈ U . Suppose i < j and let w ∈ Uai,
y ∈ Uaj . Then there exists α ∈ Autf (V ) such that αy = w + y.

Proof. From y, w ∈ U follows h(y + w) = 0, and e(Uai) < e(Uaj ) im-
plies h(f aj−1(y + w)) = aj − 1 and e(y + w) = aj. We can assume Uaj =
(y, y2, . . . , yr). Set ˜Uaj = (y + w, y2, . . . , yr). If we replace Uaj in U by ˜Uaj we
obtain another generator tuple ˜U ∈ U. Then Lemma 3.1 yields the desired
automorphism.

3.2 Marked subspaces

Marked subspaces can be traced back to [7, p. 83]. They have been studied
in [4], [6], [1], and [5]. Let sti, 0 < t1 ≤ · · · ≤ tk, be the elementary divisors
of f . We say that a k-tuple r = (r1, . . . , rk) of integers is admissible if

0 ≤ ri ≤ ti,

i = 1, . . . , k.

(3.4)

Each U ∈ U together with an admissible tuple r gives rise to a subspace

W (r, U) = hf r1u1i ⊕ · · · ⊕ hf rkuki,

(3.5)

which is marked in V . Conversely, a subspace W is marked in V only if
W = W (r, U) for some U ∈ U and some admissible r. The next theorem
describes those subspaces W (r, U) that are independent of the generator
tuple U.

Theorem 3.4. ([2], [11, p. 162]) Let U ∈ U be given as in (2.1), and let
r = (r1, . . . , rk) be admissible. Then the following statements are equivalent.

(i) The subspace W (r, U) is characteristic.

(ii) The tuples t = (t1, . . . , tk) and r = (r1, . . . , rk) satisfy

r1 ≤ · · · ≤ rk

and t1 − r1 ≤ · · · ≤ tk − rk.

(3.6)

(iii) The subspace W (r, U) is hyperinvariant.

Note that (3.6) implies that ri = rj if ti = tj. Let U = (Ua1, . . . , Uam),
a1 < a2 < · · · < am. Hence if X is characteristic then X is marked if and
only if

X = f c1hUa1i ⊕ · · · ⊕ f cmhUami

(3.7)

with 0 ≤ ci ≤ ai, i = 1, . . . , m, and

c1 ≤ c2 ≤ · · · ≤ cm,

and a1 − c1 ≤ a2 − c2 ≤ · · · ≤ am − cm.

(3.8)

It is known that marked subspaces can be characterized in a basis free

manner.

Theorem 3.5. (see [1]) A subspace W ∈ Inv (V ) is marked if and only if

f sW ∩ f s+rV = f s(W ∩ f rV )

for all s ≥ 0, r ≥ 0.

A diﬀerent characterization of marked subspaces can be found in [6].

4 Characteristic subspaces

4.1 Hyperinvariant subspaces and projections
Let U = (cid:0)Ua1, . . . , Uam(cid:1) ∈ U be given as in (2.5) such that e(Uaµ) = aµ,
|Uaµ| = d(aµ), µ = 1, . . . , m, and let (2.6), i.e. V = hUa1i ⊕ · · · ⊕ hUami,
be the corresponding decomposition of V . In the following we are concerned
with characteristic subspaces X which have the property that x ∈ X, implies

πix ∈ X for all

i = 1, . . . , m.

(4.1)

We have seen in Example 1.1 that (4.1) is not satisﬁed for all X ∈ Chinv(V ).

Lemma 4.1. If X is a characteristic subspace of V then

X ∩ hUaii = f cihUaii,

i = 1, . . . , m,

for some 0 ≤ ci ≤ ai.

Proof. Let Uai = (v1, . . . , vℓ). Set Xi = X ∩ hUaii. Assume Xi
6= 0, and
h(Xi) = ci. Then Xi ⊆ f cihUaii. Suppose y ∈ Xi and h(y) = ci. Then
y = f ciw for some w ∈ V with h(w) = 0. We have w = w1 + · · · + wm,
wj ∈ hUaj i, j = 1, . . . , m. Then f ciw = f ciw1 + · · · + f ciwm ∈ Xi and
(2.6) imply f cwj = 0 if j 6= i. Hence y = f ciwi, wi ∈ Uai, h(wi) = 0. By
Lemma 3.2 we can replace some vector in Uai by wi. Thus, without loss of
generality we can assume y = f civ1. Let αk ∈ Autf (V ) be an automorphism
which maps v1 to vk, k = 1, . . . , ℓ. Since X is characteristic we obtain
αk(y) = f civk ∈ X. Therefore

f cihv1, . . . , vℓi = f cihUaii ⊆ Xi.

Hence we have shown that Xi = f cihUaii.

Lemma 4.2. Let X be a characteristic subspace of V . The following state-
ments are equivalent.

(i) X is hyperinvariant.

(ii) We have

X = (cid:0)X ∩ hUa1i(cid:1) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (cid:0)X ∩ hUami(cid:1).

(iii) If x ∈ X, x = x1 + · · · + xm, xi ∈ hUaii, i = 1, . . . , m, then

xi ∈ X for all

i = 1, . . . , m.

7

(4.2)

(4.3)

Proof. (ii) ⇔ (iii). Because of X ∩ hUaii ⊆ πiX we have πiX ⊆ X if and
only if

πiX = X ∩ hUaii.

(4.4)

It is obvious that (iii), as well as (ii), is satisﬁed if and only if (4.4) holds for
all i, i = 1, . . . , m.
(ii) ⇒ (i) If (4.2) holds then Lemma 4.1 implies

X = f c1hUa1i ⊕ · · · ⊕ f cmhUami.

Hence X is marked, and it follows from Theorem 1.3 that X is hyperinvariant.
(i) ⇒ (ii) Set ˜X = ⊕m
i=1(X ∩ hUaii). Then ˜X ⊆ X. Let x ∈ X. Then πµ ∈
Endf (V ) implies πµx = xµ ∈ (X ∩ hUaii), µ = 1, . . . , m. Hence X ⊆ ˜X.

We extend Lemma 4.2 to the case where If X ∈ Chinv(V ) \ Hinv(V ).

Theorem 4.3. If X is a characteristic subspace then

˜X = (cid:0)X ∩ hUa1i(cid:1) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (cid:0)X ∩ hUami(cid:1)

(4.5)

is the largest hyperinvariant subspace contained in X.

Proof. From Lemma 4.1 we obtain

X ∩ hUaii = f cihUaii, 0 ≤ ci ≤ ai, i = 1, . . . , m.

(4.6)

Hence

(4.7)
We show that ˜X is hyperinvariant. By Theorem 3.4 we have to prove that
i < j implies

˜X = f c1hUa1i ⊕ · · · ⊕ f cmhUami.

ci ≤ cj

and ai − ci ≤ aj − cj.

(4.8)

Suppose i < j and let vi ∈ Uai, vj ∈ Uaj . By Lemma 3.3 there exists
an α ∈ Autf (V ) such that αvj = vi + vj. Since X is characteristic and
f cj vj ∈ ˜X ⊆ X we have α(f cj vj) = f cj (vi + vj) ∈ X. Thus

f cj vj ∈ f cj hUaj i = X ∩ hUaj i ⊆ X

implies f cj vi ∈ X. Hence f cj vi ∈ X ∩ hUaii. Then (4.6) yields cj ≥ ci.

The second inequality in (4.8) can be proved as follows. Because of
e(vi) = ai = e(vi + f aj −aivj) we can substitute vi in Uai by vi + f aj −aivj.
Then there exists an α ∈ Autf (V ) with αvi = vi + f aj −aivj. Hence

αf civi = f civi + f ci+aj −aivj.

8

Because of f civi ∈ X we have f civi + f ci+aj−aivj ∈ X, and therefore
f ci+aj −aivj ∈ X. Hence f ci+aj −aivj ∈ hUaj i implies f ci+aj −aivj ∈ X ∩ hUaj i.
Then (4.6) yields ci + (aj − ai) ≥ cj, i.e. ai − ci ≤ aj − cj.

It remains to show that all hyperinvariant subspaces contained in X are

subsets of ˜X. Let W ∈ Hinv(V ). Then it follows from Lemma 4.2 that

W = (W ∩ hUa1i) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (W ∩ hUami) = f d1hUa1i ⊕ · · · ⊕ f dmhUami,

with suitable integers 0 ≤ di ≤ ai. Suppose W ⊆ X. Then

f dihUaii = W ∩ hUaii ⊆ X ∩ hUaii = f cihUaii.

Therefore (4.7) implies W ⊆ ˜X.

4.2 Special cases

In the following lemma we assume that f is such that

d(a) = k > 1,

and d(r) = 0 if

r 6= a,

(4.9)

or equivalently V [f ] = f a−1V and dim V [f ] = k > 1. In that case there are
k blocks in the Jordan form of f and all Jordan blocks of f have size a.

Lemma 4.4. Assume (4.9). Then there exist β, γ ∈ Autf (V ) such that
β + γ = ι.

Proof. Let Na be the Jordan block (2.3). Then the Jordan form of f is

J = diag(Na, . . . , Na) = Ik ⊗ Na,

and it is no loss of generality to assume f = J. Deﬁne M = (Na ⊗ Ik) −
(N T

a ⊗ Ik). Then

and β = M + P1, γ = M + Pc. Then β, γ ∈ Autf (V ), and β + γ = ι.

Lemma 4.5. Suppose X is a characteristic subspace of V . Let x ∈ X and

x = x1 + · · · + xm, xi ∈ hUaii, i = 1, . . . , m.

If

|Uas| > 1 then xs ∈ X.

Proof. According to Lemma 4.4 there exist βs, γs ∈ Autf (hUsi) such that

Let ψ : V → V and φ : V → V be given by

βs + γs = idhUsi.

ψv = φv = v

for

v ∈ hU1, . . . , Us−1, Us+1, . . . , Umi

and

ψv = βsv, φv = γsv

for

v ∈ Us.

Then ψ, φ ∈ Autf (V ). Therefore (ψ + φ)x = (βs + γs)xs = xs ∈ X.

The following two theorems, which involve special types of Ulm sequences,
will cover the hypothesis (i) of Theorem 5.1. It should be mentioned that
the proofs of Theorem 4.6 and Theorem 4.8 below employ marked subspaces
and thus are based on Theorem 1.3.

Theorem 4.6. If the sequence (2.4) contains at most one Ulm invariant
with d(i) = 1, then each characteristic subspace of V is hyperinvariant.

Proof. Suppose |Uaq | ≥ 1, and |Uai| > 1 if i 6= q. Let x ∈ X and x =
x1 + · · · + xm, xi ∈ hUaii, i = 1, . . . , m. Then Lemma 4.5 implies xi ∈ X
if i 6= q. Therefore, also xq ∈ X, and we obtain (4.3). Then Lemma 4.2
completes the proof.

Bru, Rodman and Schneider [4, Thm.3.4, p.223] have shown (see also [6,
3.2.4, p. 28]) that each invariant subspace of V is marked if and only if the
sizes of blocks in the Jordan form of f diﬀer at most by one. Then, for some
q the space V is of the form V = hUqi or V = hUqi ⊕ hUq+1i. We only
need the special case where |Uq| = |Uq+1| = 1. Then f has Jordan form
J = diag(Nq, Nq+1). For the sake of completeness we consider that case in a
lemma and include a proof.

10

Lemma 4.7. Let

V = hu1i ⊕ hu2i

and

e(u1) = q, e(u2) = q + 1.

(4.10)

Then (i) each invariant subspace of V is marked, (ii) each characteristic
subspace of V is hyperinvariant.

Proof. (i) Let W ∈ Inv (V ), W 6= 0. Set h(W ) = min{h(w); w ∈ W, w 6= 0}.
It is easy to see that it suﬃces to consider subspaces W with h(W ) = 0.
Suppose W is cyclic, W = hwi and h(w) = 0. Then e(w) = q or e(w) = q + 1.
In the ﬁrst case we have (w, u2) ∈ U, in the second case we obtain (u1, w) ∈ U.
Thus hwi is marked.

Now suppose W is not cyclic and h(W ) = 0. Then W = hw1i ⊕ hw2i,
w1 6= 0, w2 6= 0, and min{h(w1), h(w2)} = 0. Suppose h(w1) = 0.
If
e(w1) = q then we have (w1, u2) ∈ U, and we can assume w1 = u1, such that
W = hu1i⊕hw2i. If w2 = z1+z2, zi ∈ huii, i = 1, 2, then W = hu1i⊕hz2i. Let
h(z2) = r. Then z2 = f rv2, where v2 ∈ hu2i, h(v2) = 0. Hence e(v2) = q + 1
and (u1, v2) ∈ U. Therefore W = hu1i ⊕ f rhv2i. A similar argument works
in the case e(w1) = q + 1. (ii) This follows from Theorem 1.3.

Part (ii) of the preceding lemma is a special case of the following result.

Theorem 4.8. Suppose the Ulm sequence (2.4) contains exactly two invari-
ants d(i) and d(j) equal to 1, and i and j are successive integers. Then each
characteristic subspace X ⊆ V is hyperinvariant.

Proof. We can assume |Uas| = |Uas+1| = 1, as = q, as+1 = q +1, and |Uaµ| > 1
if aµ 6= as and aµ 6= as+1. Suppose X ⊆ V is characteristic. Let x ∈ X be
decomposed as

x = x1 + · · · + xs−1 + (xs + xs+1) + xs+2 + · · · + xm,

(4.11)

xµ ∈ hUaµi. Then Lemma 4.5 implies xµ ∈ X if µ 6= s, µ 6= s + 1. Hence
xs + xs+1 ∈ X. Set Xµ = X ∩ hUaµi. Then

X = X1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Xs−1 ⊕ (X ∩ hUas, Uas+1i) ⊕ Xs+2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Xm.

Lemma 4.1 yields

Xµ = f cµhUaµi,

if µ 6= s, µ 6= s + 1.

(4.12)

Let ˆf be the restriction of f on hUas, Uas+1i. We show that the subspace
Xs,s+1 := X ∩ hUas, Uas+1i is characteristic in hUas, Uas+1i with respect to ˆf .

11

Let ˆα be an automorphism of hUas, Uas+1i that commutes with ˆf , and let ıµ,
µ = 1, . . . , m, be the identity map on hUaµi. We extend ˆα in a natural way
to an automorphism α of V such that

α = ı1 + · · · + ıs−1 + ˆα + ıs+2 + · · · + ım ∈ Autf (V ).

ˆαx = αx ∈ X. Thus, ˆαx ∈ Xs,s+1, which im-
If x ∈ Xs,s+1 then
plies that Xs,s+1 is characteristic in hUas, Uas+1i with respect to ˆf . The
pair (Uas, Uas+1) is a generator tuple of hUas, Uas+1i. From Lemma 4.7 we
know that the characteristic subspace Xs,s+1 is hyperinvariant and therefore
marked in hUs, Us+1i. Hence

X ∩ hUs, Us+1i = Xs,s+1 = f csh ˜Usi ⊕ f cs+1h ˜Us+1i,

(4.13)

with hUs, Us+1i = h ˜Us, ˜Us+1i. Combining (4.12) and (4.13) shows that X is
marked. Therefore, by Theorem 1.3, the subspace X is hyperinvariant.

4.3 Characteristic but not hyperinvariant

Theorem 4.10 below is crucial for a proof of the implication “(ii) ⇒ (i)” of
Theorem 1.2. We ﬁrst note a technical lemma, which is adapted from [10,
p. 63]. It clears the way for Theorem 4.10. Deﬁne

h ¯U[i,j]i = hUai, . . . , Uaj i, 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ m.

Lemma 4.9. Let U = (cid:0)Ua1, . . . , Uam(cid:1) ∈ U , and

|Uaρ| = |Uaτ | = 1, aρ + 1 < aτ .

(4.14)

Let Uaρ = (u(ρ)), Uaτ = (u(τ )). Deﬁne

z = f aρ−1u(ρ) + f aτ −2u(τ )

(4.15)

and

Y = {y ∈ V ; e(y) = 2, h(y) = aρ − 1, h(f y) = aτ − 1}.

(4.16)

Then hY i is characteristic, and

hY i = hzi ⊕ h ¯U[ρ+1,τ −1]i[f ] ⊕ h ¯U[τ +1,m]i[f 2].

(4.17)

12

Proof. The subspace hY i is deﬁned via exponent and height. Hence it is
characteristic. Set

Q = hzi ⊕ h ¯U[ρ+1,τ −1]i[f ] ⊕ h ¯U[τ +1,m]i[f 2].

We ﬁrst show that Y ⊆ Q. Let y ∈ Y ,

y = x1 + · · · + xm xi ∈ hUaii, i = 1, . . . , m.

Put x[i,j] = xi + · · · + xj, 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ m. From h(y) = aρ − 1 follows

y ∈ ⊕m

i=1 f aρ−1hUaii = f aρ−1hu(ρ)i ⊕ f aρ−1hh ¯U[ρ+1,m]i,

and h(f y) = aτ − 1 implies

f y ∈ f aτ −1 ⊕m

i=ρ hUaii = f aτ −1 ⊕m

i=τ hUaii.

Therefore f xi = 0, i = ρ, . . . , τ − 1, and

y ∈ f aρ−1hu(ρ)i ⊕ h ¯U[ρ+1,τ −1]i[f ] ⊕ f aτ −2h ¯U[τ,m]i.

(4.18)

From e(y) = 2 we obtain

y ∈ f aρ−1hu(ρ)i ⊕ h ¯U[ρ+1,τ −1]i[f ] ⊕ h ¯U[τ,m]i[f 2].

We have

h ¯U[ρ+1,τ −1]i[f ] = ⊕τ −1

i=ρ+1 f ai−1hUaii ⊆ f aρ+1−1 ⊕τ −1

i=ρ+1 hUaii ⊆ f aρV.

The assumption aτ > aρ + 1 implies

h ¯U[τ,m]i[f 2] = ⊕m

i=τ f ai−2hUaii ⊆ ⊕m

i=τ f aτ −2hUaii ⊆ f aρV

and

h ¯U[τ +1,m]i[f 2] ⊆ ⊕m

i=τ +1f aτ +1−2hUaii ⊆ ⊕m

i=τ +1f aτ −1hUaii.

(4.19)

Hence (4.18) and h(y) = aρ − 1 yield xρ 6= 0, i.e. xρ = f aρ−1u(ρ). Then

y = (cid:0)f aρ−1u(ρ) + (x[ρ+1,τ −1](cid:1) + (cid:0)xτ + x[τ +1,m](cid:1) = x[ρ,τ −1] + x[τ,m],

x[ρ,τ −1] ∈ h ¯U[ρ,τ −1]i[f ], x[τ +1,m] ∈ ¯U[τ +1,m]i[f 2].

From e(y) = 2 and f x[ρ,τ −1] = 0 follows x[τ,m]
6= 0, e(x[τ,m]) = 2, and f y =
f (x[τ,m]). Therefore xτ 6= 0. Otherwise x[τ +1,m] 6= 0, and then (4.19) would
imply h(f y) = h(f x[τ +1,m]) ≥ aτ . Hence

xτ = f aτ −2u(τ ) + γf aτ −1u(τ ), γ ∈ {0, 1}.

13

Putting the pieces together we obtain

y = (cid:0)f aρ−1u(ρ) + f aτ −2u(τ ) + γf aτ −1u(τ )(cid:1) + x[ρ+1,τ −1] + x[τ +1,m],

(4.20)

x[ρ+1,τ −1] ∈ hU[ρ+1],τ −1]i[f ], x[τ +1,m] ∈ hU[τ +1,m]i[f 2],

(4.21)

and

and

f aρ−1u(ρ) + f aτ −2u(τ ) + γf aτ −1u(τ ) = z + γf z ∈ hzi.

Hence y ∈ Q, and hY i ⊆ Q. The space Q is generated by vectors of the form

z + x[ρ+1,τ −1] + x[τ +1,m], z + f z + x[ρ+1,τ −1] + x[τ +1,m],

(4.22)

where x[ρ+1,τ −1] and x[τ +1,m] satisfy (4.21). It is easy to see that the vectors
(4.22) lie in Y . Hence Q ⊆ hY i.

In general, if (4.14) holds then there exists more than one characteristic
subspace of V that is not hyperinvariant.
In a subsequent paper [3] we
construct a larger class of charcateristic non-hyperinvariant subspaces of V ,
which includes hY i as a special case.

Example 1.1 continued. If |K| = 2,

V = K 4 = he1i ⊕ he2i, e(e1) = 1, e(e2) = 3,

then (4.14) holds with (a1, a2) = (1, 3). Let X be the subspace as in (1.2).
Set z = e1 + f e2 = e1 + e3 and Y = {y; e(y) = 2, h(y) = 0, h(f y) = 2}.
Then X = hzi = hY i.

If |K| > 2 then Y = {c1e1 + d3e3 + d4e4; c1 6= 0, d3 6= 0} and

hY i = span{e1, e3, e4} = Ker f 2.

Then hY i is hyperinvariant, and hzi ( hY i.

Theorem 4.10. Suppose K = GF (2). Assume that (4.14) holds. Let

Y = {y; e(y) = 2, h(y) = aρ − 1, h(f y) = aτ − 1}.

(4.23)

Then the subspace hY i is characteristic and not hyperinvariant.

Proof. Let πρ : V → V be the projection on hu(ρ)i along the complement
hUa1, . . . , Uaρ−1, Uaρ+1, . . . , Uami. Then πρ commutes with f .
If z is given
by (4.15) then z ∈ hY i and πρz = f aρ−1u(ρ). Note that f aρ−1u(ρ) /∈ hzi.
Therefore (4.17) implies πρz /∈ hY i. Hence hY i is not hyperinvariant.

5 Proof of Shoda’s theorem

We reformulate Theorem 1.2 in terms of Ulm invariants and thus make the
connection with Theorem 26 of Kaplanski [10, p. 63].

Theorem 5.1. ([12], [10]) Let K = GF (2) and f : V → V be nilpotent.
Then the following statements are equivalent.
(i) At most two Ulm invariants of (V, f ) are equal to 1, and if there are
exactly two, then they correspond to successive integers.
(ii) The characteristic subspaces of V are hyperinvariant.

If there exists at most one Ulm
Proof. Suppose condition (i) is satisﬁed.
invariant equal to 1 then we can apply Theorem 4.6. If there are exactly two
Ulm invariants d(r) and d(s) equal to 1 and s = r + 1, then we can apply
Theorem 4.8. If condition (i) is not satisﬁed then we have (4.14) for some
ρ, τ . Thus Theorem 4.10 completes the proof.
