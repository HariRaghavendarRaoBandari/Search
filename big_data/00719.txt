Abstract

We initiate the study of multiloop scattering amplitudes in the Nambu–Goto theory
on the worldsheet of a non-critical string. We start with a brute force calculation of
two loop four particle scattering. Somewhat surprisingly, even though non-trivial UV
counterterms are present at this order, on-shell amplitudes remain polynomial in the
momenta of colliding particles. We show that this can be understood as a consequence
of existence of certain close by (semi)integrable models. Furthermore, these arguments
can be extended to obtain the answer for three and four loop scattering, bypassing the
brute force calculation. The resulting amplitudes develop non-polynomial (logarithmic)
dependence on the momenta starting at three loops.

Introduction

Scattering amplitudes provide the most fundamental set of observables in a quantum ﬁeld
theory. In recent years a dramatic progress has been achieved in developing eﬃcient tools
for perturbative multiloop calculations (see, e.g., [1, 2] for an overview) and a number of
intriguing insights has been gained building upon the structure of perturbative Feynman
diagrams. These include dual superconformal invariance [3] and positive Grassmannian
structure [4] of N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory, as well as color/kinematics duality
[5] and enhanced ultraviolet cancellations [6] of supergravity amplitudes. Much of the eﬀorts
were focused on highly supersymmetric theories, although the developed techniques have also
proven to be very eﬃcient in the studies of hadronic processes as relevant for the LHC [7].
In this paper we initiate the study of multiloop amplitudes for yet another theory. As
we explain shortly, this study is motivated both by purely theoretical considerations and
by the QCD applications. The theory is non-supersymmetric, and unlike the examples
mentioned before, it lives in a two-dimensional space-time. This is the world-sheet theory
of a bosonic string propagating in a ﬂat D-dimensional space-time. At the leading order
in derivative expansion the theory is described by the Nambu–Goto action. In order to set
up a scattering problem one picks an inﬁnitely long string as a background, and studies the
scattering of small perturbations (“wiggles”) propagating along the string. After ﬁxing the
static gauge one arrives then at the following action for the physical transverse excitations

is the induced metric on the string worldsheet, and (cid:96)s is the string width. The study of scat-
tering amplitudes in this theory has been initiated in [8] and motivated by the following ques-
tion. At any value of D the Nambu–Goto action (1) describes a healthy non-renormalizable
eﬀective ﬁeld theory. The question is how an eﬀective ﬁeld theorist studying this theory, who
is not smart enough to come up with the light cone quantization or Polyakov formalism, will
discover that something special happens at the critical number of dimensions, D = 26?

A (partial) answer to this question can be shortly summarized as follows (for details
see [8–10]). At tree level the Nambu–Goto theory is integrable (i.e., particle production is
absent) for any D. However, only for a critical string with D = 26 (and also for D = 3)
can the integrability be preserved at the full quantum level. The corresponding S-matrix
is entirely determined by a phase shift in two particle scattering, which turns out to be

1

independent of the ﬂavor of colliding particles and takes the following simple form1,

e2iδGGRT (s) = ei(cid:96)2

ss/4 ,

(2)

where s is the conventional Mandelstam variable. So at D = 3 and D = 26 a naively
non-renormalizable theory (1) gives rise to scattering amplitudes well-deﬁned at all energies.
As discussed in detail in [9], the S-matrix (2) exhibits a number of remarkable properties
indicating that it describes a gravitational theory, rather than a conventional ﬁeld theory.
In particular, it exhibits a novel asymptotic behavior at high energies (dubbed “asymptotic
fragility”), which is characterized by the absence of an ultraviolet (UV) conformal ﬁxed
point, absence of sharply deﬁned local observables and time delays proportional to the center
of mass energy of the collision, in agreement with the Hawking evaporation time in two-
dimensional gravity. This raises an intriguing question how to construct non-integrable
asymptotically fragile theories. If they exist they may provide a useful laboratory to address
the notorious puzzles of black hole physics. This question provides a major motivation for
the present brute force study of scattering amplitudes at general D.

The question appears very hard by the very nature of asymptotic fragility. Indeed, clas-
siﬁcation of conventional renormalization group (RG) ﬂows originating from a UV conformal
ﬁxed point starts with specifying all possible relevant deformations of the corresponding UV
conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT). This is straightforward for weakly coupled CFTs, and doable
(even if challenging) in many cases for strongly coupled ﬁxed points as well. Asymptotically
fragile theories do not give rise to a UV CFT, and do not allow to deﬁne local operators, so
it is not clear a priori whether they can be deformed at all. Still it is tempting to go beyond
integrable examples of asymptotic fragility by perturbing around the exact solution (2).

To get a sense of the challenge, note that even in the critical case the existence of the
UV complete S-matrix (2) does not imply that the straightforward perturbative expansion
in the Nambu–Goto theory is free of the UV divergences.
Instead, after choosing a spe-
ciﬁc renormalization scheme one expects to encounter an inﬁnite set of higher-dimensional
counterterms even at D = 3, 26 (this expectation will be conﬁrmed by explicit calculations
presented later in the paper). However, these can be ﬁxed by imposing an extra requirement,
namely by insisting on integrability.

In other words to construct a theory one needs to ﬁnd a question to which it provides the
answer. Note that this situation is not speciﬁc at all to the realm of quantum ﬁeld theories.
For instance, a random number on a real axis may be characterized by an inﬁnite sequence of
its digits (“counterterm coeﬃcients”). Analogously to a garden variety non-renormalizable
theory most numbers cannot be characterized in any sharp way, i.e. they do not provide an
answer to any meaningful question2. Some numbers, such as rational ones, provide answers

1Here GGRT stands for Goddard, Goldstone, Rebbi and Thorn [11], because for general D S-matrix (2)

describes a light cone quantized string.

2Clearly, to qualify as meaningful, a question should at least have a ﬁnite length. Hence there is at most

a countable set of meaningful questions versus a continuum of numbers.

2

to rather straightforward and boring questions. Other numbers, such as π, e, or ζ(3), provide
answers to more sophisticated and interesting questions.
To arrive at the S-matrix (2) one may ask “Are there integrable theories of D−2 massless
bosons with non-linearly realized ISO(1, D − 1) symmetry?”. To construct non-integrable
asymptotically fragile theories one needs to look for a less restrictive version of this question,
which still would allow ﬁxing (almost) all of the counterterms. At the moment we do not
know what this new question is, so one reason to take a careful look at the properties of the
perturbative diagrams is that they provide “experimental” data, which might help to guess
the correct question. We would like to give up integrability, however it is natural to try to
keep the other conditions, which explains why we decided to take a look at the non-critical
Nambu–Goto.

It is worth noting that an unusual and interesting property of the S-matrix (2) is that
its perturbative expansion in (cid:96)2
s absolutely converges at all values of energy. In other words,
this S-matrix is literally given by a sum of the corresponding Feynman graphs, without
any non-perturbative eﬀects. This serves as an additional motivation to take a look at the
perturbative amplitudes in a non-critical case; it would be remarkable if there were non-
integrable theories with this property.

To conclude with motivations, let us stress that an independent reason to develop compu-
tational techniques allowing to construct and analyze non-integrable asymptotically fragile
theories comes from QCD. Understanding the planar limit of conﬁning theories, such as pure
gluodynamics, is a longstanding and fascinating problem. One aspect of this problem is to
ﬁnd a description of the worldsheet theory of conﬁning strings. Time delay corresponding to
(2) has a very transparent geometrical origin—a physical length of a relativistic string is pro-
portional to its length. A worldsheet theory of a conﬁning string preserves two-dimensional
unitarity up to arbitrarily high energies in the planar limit, and one expects it to exhibit
time delays growing with energy. Generically, one does not expect a planar worldsheet the-
ory to be integrable. Hence it is very plausible that conﬁning strings in general give rise
to non-integrable asymptotically fragile theories in the planar limit. These theories may
be studied “experimentally” using lattice simulations [12–15]. A recently developed TBA
approach [16, 17] allows to relate this data to the worldsheet S-matrix. This allows to re-
(cid:46) 1. However, to
construct the worldsheet action at small and intermediate energies s(cid:96)2
s
extend this success to higher energies, it will be useful to develop tools allowing to work with
asymptotically fragile theories in the UV regime s(cid:96)2
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

s (cid:29) 1.
In section 2 we set up the notations,
discuss some generalities about how the calculation is organized and review the previously
available tree level and one loop results. At this order no non-vanishing on-shell counterterm
is present, apart from the evanescent Einstein term, which is a total derivative for a physical
number of worldsheet dimensions, d = 2.

In section 3 we present a brute force two loop calculation of the two-to-two scattering
amplitude. This calculation is instructive from the technical viewpoint, since it explicitly

3

illustrates the role of the evanescent counterterm which was found at one loop (similar
observations have been recently made for gravitational amplitudes in [18]). At this order
two non-trivial counterterms are allowed, and need to be introduced to obtain a ﬁnite answer
for the amplitude. However, the amplitude has a surprising property that the corresponding
coupling constants do not run, i.e. no log µ dependence arises in the ﬁnite part of the
amplitude despite the presence of 1/ poles (we always work in dimensional regularization
to preserve the non-linearly realized Poincar´e symmetry of the Nambu–Goto action).

We are not aware of any symmetry reason for this surprising cancellation. However,
in section 4 we manage to explain it as a consequence of the validity of the gravitational
dressing procedure introduced in [19]. In fact, our argument provides a very eﬃcient short-
cut to reproduce the whole two loop amplitude without performing the actual calculation.
Furthermore, a straightforward extension of the argument allows to predict the amplitude
up to four loops as a result of one-loop calculation. We ﬁnd that the cancellations observed
at two loops do not persist at higher orders. New counterterms arising at three loop level
exhibit a non-trivial log µ dependence. We discuss future directions in section 5.

2 Generalities and a review of prior results

Let us start with several general comments about our conventions and on how the calculation
is organized. We are using dimensional regularization throughout this paper. This is the only
regularization we are aware of, which preserves the nonlinearly realized Poincare symmetry
of the Nambu–Goto action,

δαiX j = −(cid:0)δijσα + X i∂αX j(cid:1) .

(3)

Given that an asymptotically fragile theory is not expected to behave any diﬀerent from
a garden variety non-renormalizable eﬀective theory as far as oﬀ-shell observables are con-
cerned, we are only interested in on-shell renormalization of the non-critical Nambu–Goto
theory.
In this paper we restrict to the two-to-two scattering amplitude, which can be
parametrized in the following way,

Mij,kl = Aδijδkl + Bδikδjl + Cδilδjk ,

(4)

where i, j (k, l) are the ﬂavor labels of incoming (outgoing) particles. The corresponding
momenta are p1, p2 and p3, p4, so that the Mandelstam invariants are

s = −(p1 + p2)2 ,

t = −(p1 − p3)2 , u = −(p1 − p4)2 .

Without a loss of generality, in what follows we assume that p1, p3 are right-moving momenta
and p2, p4 are left-moving (see Figure 1). Then t = 0 and u = −s so that the A, B, C am-
plitudes become functions of a single Mandelstam variable s. With this choice of kinematics
A gives the annihilation amplitude, B corresponds to transmission and C to reﬂection.

Note that particle production is absent in the Nambu–Goto theory at the tree level, so the
ﬁrst inelastic process (two-to-four scattering) arises only at O((cid:96)6
s) order. The corresponding
amplitude has been calculated in [24]. As a result the two-to-two unitarity is ﬁrst broken
only at the O((cid:96)12
s ) (ﬁve loop) order and provides a useful guidance at lower orders. In terms
of functions A, B and C the two particle unitarity conditions read as follows

A somewhat unusual property of massless scattering, which is useful to keep in mind,
is that these amplitudes have a cut starting at the origin and extending over all real axis,
which makes it impossible to perform an analytic continuation to the lower half of the physical
sheet in the complex s-plane without passing through a singularity. Of course, one can still
analytically continue the A, B, C functions into the Im s < 0 region, however, after this
continuation the lower half of the s-plane is not a part of the physical region. Nevertheless,
crossing symmetry and real analyticity requirements still impose useful constraints on these
amplitudes, which read as

where A(eiπs) stands for the analytic continuation from s to −s through the upper half
plane.

Previously, tree level and one loop amplitudes were calculated in [8]. At tree level one

ﬁnds that only the transmission amplitude is non-zero and it is given by

(10)

At one loop one ﬁnds two physically distinct contributions into the amplitude. First, there
is a rational term, which corresponds to the Polchisnki–Strominger (PS) interaction [20],
contributing to annihilations and reﬂections,

A4 = −C4 = −D − 26

(11)

Second, as required by unitarity, the transmission amplitude acquires an imaginary part,

B4 = i

s3 .

The annihilation/reﬂection part obviously vanishes at D = 26. It also vanishes in a single
ﬂavor (D = 3) case, because the only physical amplitude is then given by the sum A+B +C.
Both for D = 26 and D = 3 the remaining transmission amplitude agrees with the phase shift
(2), given that after accounting for the proper normalization of states the two are related as

Note that all physical on-shell amplitudes are ﬁnite at one-loop. This follows from the
absence of non-trivial O((cid:96)4
s) counterterms compatible with non-linearly realized Poincar´e
symmetry. However, if one keeps external momenta in d = 2 − 2 dimensions (i.e., does not
impose the two dimensional relation stu = 0), one ﬁnds the following divergent contribution
into the amplitude,

(12)

This contribution is related to the presence of an evanescent operator, the Einstein–Hilbert
term, which turns into a total derivative at d = 2. To cancel the divergence (12) one needs
to add the following counterterm to the action,

However, from the viewpoint of calculating the physical on-shell amplitudes, which is our
goal here, nothing forces us to include this counterterm yet. So it will be instructive to see
that the same counterterm is also required for the consistency of the physical on-shell two
loop amplitudes.

3 Brute force two loop calculation

Let us describe now the two loop calculation and its results. The calculation itself is rather
straightforward, even if somewhat tedious. It was carried out in Mathematica with assistance
from FeynRules [21], FeynArts [22] and FeynCalc [23]. There are three diﬀerent topologies
contributing at this order, as illustrated in Figure 2. These are two loop double ﬁshes and
wine glass diagrams, and also one loop ﬁsh diagrams, where one of the vertices corresponds
to the evanescent counterterm (13).

At this order one ﬁnds two non-trivial counterterms in the Lagrangian,

Explicit expressions for ﬁnite parts of amplitudes for a general value of CE1 are too ugly to
provide them here, so we will present only their physical values at

CE1 = D − 8 .

7

However, it is worth pointing out that, as anticipated at the end of Section 2, this value of
CE1 indeed does get ﬁxed from the properties of the physical two loop amplitudes. Namely,
for any other value of CE1 the unitarity conditions (5), (6), (7) fail to be satisﬁed. Note that
the physical value of CE1 is diﬀerent from CE1 = (D − 8)/2 which would set to zero the UV
counterterms (18), which is not surprising. It is somewhat surprising though that all UV
divergences encountered so far vanish at D = 8, but this appears to be a coincidence.

For the physical value of CE1 ﬁnite parts of the on-shell two loop amplitudes take the

The most surprising property of these amplitudes is that they are polynomial in s. Given
the presence of two non-trivial UV counterterms one would expect the amplitudes to depend
on the renormalization scale µ, and as a consequence, also on log s. This did not happen.
It was noticed recently for gravitational amplitudes [18], that in the presence of evanescent
divergences the coeﬃcient in front of the leading UV 1/-pole is in general diﬀerent from
the coeﬃcient in front of the leading log µ dependence. We also observe it here, but a really
peculiar property of the Nambu-Goto amplitudes is that log µ dependence automatically
cancels out at two loop order.

We are not aware of any conventional symmetry argument for this cancellation. However,
as we argue in the next section, it can be explained based on the existence of certain close by
(semi)integrable models. Furthermore these arguments will allow us to reconstruct without
much calculations not only the two loop amplitude, but also three and four loop amplitudes.
Finally, let us point out that before imposing the two-dimensional kinematical restriction

stu = 0, on-shell two loop amplitudes contain additional divergence of the form

Similar to what we found at one loop, this indicates the presence of a new evanescent
operator, and this operator will be required to ensure unitarity of physical amplitudes at
higher loop orders. This new evanescent operator is related to the identity

Gαβ ≡ Rαβ − 1
2

gαβR = 0 ,

(22)

which holds in two dimensions. This identity implies that any operator proportional to the
Einstein tensor Gαβ is evanescent.

4 Four loops from gravitational (un)dressing

The surprising feature of the physical amplitudes (19) and (20) is that they take polynomial
form, i.e. no log (s/µ2) dependence arises despite the presence of physical UV divergences.
We are not aware of any conventional symmetry explanation for this. Nevertheless, as we
will see now, this property can be understood as a consequence of the existence of certain
(semi)integrable theories.

Let us ﬁrst present the argument for the critical string case D = 26 (which also applies
at D = 3), where it applies in the most straightforward way. As we explained in the
Introduction, for these values of D the phase shift (2) deﬁnes an integrable theory enjoying
non-linearly realized target space Poincar´e symmetry. This implies that one should be able to
reproduce the corresponding S-matrix perturbatively, starting with the Nambu–Goto action
and appropriately choosing the ﬁnite part of coeﬃcients for higher order counterterms. No
Poincar´e invariant counterterm is present at one loop level, so the only freedom at the level
of two loop amplitudes is related to counterterms (14), (15), which may only aﬀect the
polynomial part of the two loop amplitudes. Hence, the presence of non-polynomial terms
would prevent us from reproducing the S-matrix perturbatively from a local Lagrangian,
which explains why non-polynomial terms did not get generated at D = 3, 26.

This argument cannot be straightforwardly applied for other values of D.

Indeed, in
this case to reproduce the integrable S-matrix (2) from the local Lagrangian one needs to
introduce a one loop counterterm canceling the Polchinski–Strominger amplitude,

(cid:90)

SP S4 = (cid:96)4
s

D − 26
192π

d2σ∂α∂βX i∂α∂βX i∂γX j∂γX j ,

which breaks the non-linearly realized Poincar´e symmetry. A priori, one would expect that
insertion of this counterterm into one loop diagrams should introduce non-polynomial terms
in the diﬀerence between two loop amplitudes of the Poincar´e invariant Nambu–Goto theory
and of the GGRT theory (2).

The explanation for why this does not happen is related to the existence of the gravita-
tional dressing procedure introduced in [19]. Gravitational dressing works as follows. One

9

s/4(cid:80)

starts with an arbitrary relativistic two dimensional quantum ﬁeld theory, characterized by
the S-matrix elements S(pi). Here, unlike in the rest of this paper, all the momenta are
taken as incoming. Then a gravitationally dressed S-matrix is deﬁned by

ˆS(pi) = e(cid:96)2

i<j pi∗pj S(pi) ,

(25)

where the ∗-product is

pi ∗ pj = αβpα

i pβ
j ,

and we made use of the existence of a natural cyclic order (by rapidities) for non-zero two-
dimensional momenta. As argued in [19] the dressed amplitudes described by ˆS exhibit all
the properties expected from a healthy relativistic S-matrix. For example, starting with a
theory of D − 2 free massless bosons gravitational dressing results in the GGRT S-matrix
(2).

Now to run the argument let us start with a theory described by the following action,

S0 = Sf ree − SP S4 ,

where Sf ree is a free kinetic term for D − 2 massless bosons. Then, by construction, the
corresponding dressed theory ˆS0 has the same O((cid:96)2
s) and O((cid:96)4
s) four particles amplitudes as
the Nambu–Goto theory SN G. Moreover, at the O((cid:96)6
s) level the only diﬀerence between four
particle ˆS0 amplitudes and the Nambu–Goto ones may be due to a diﬀerent choice of S1, S2
counterterms3, i.e., it takes a polynomial form. Hence the presence of non-local log (s/µ2)
terms in the Nambu–Goto amplitudes would prevent one from writing a local Lagrangian
matching ˆS0 amplitudes. On the other hand, such a Lagrangian should exist, because S-
matrix ˆS0 exhibits all the required analytic properties. This completes the argument and
explains the absence of log (s/µ2) contributions in the amplitudes calculated in the previous
section.
Moreover, this argument immediately allows us to write down the answer for two par-
ticle Nambu–Goto amplitudes up to O((cid:96)6
s) order. Up to non-universal tree level S1 and S2
contributions they should be the same as in the ˆS0 theory, i.e. should agree with the O((cid:96)6

the matching of the imaginary parts is also guaranteed by unitarity. It is interesting though
that the dressing argument allows to correctly predict also the leading transcendental part
of (20) (the term without π2 in the denominator).

Furthermore, the dressing argument can actually be pushed quite a bit further by revers-
ing the logic above in the following way. First, gravitational dressing implies the existence of
an “undressed” theory with a local action SP S, such that its dressing gives the Nambu–Goto
amplitudes (for any choice of higher order counterterms). This follows from the possibility to
perform dressing with negative tension (cid:96)2
s (we will call this undressing). The action
of the undressed theory can be written as

s → −(cid:96)2

SP S = Sf ree − SP S4 − SP S6 − . . . ,

(29)

where the O((cid:96)6
larger number of ﬁelds and derivatives.

s) sextic vertex SP S6 was calculated in [24]. Here dots stand for terms with

For an arbitrary term in the action it is convenient to deﬁne its weight h to be equal to the
diﬀerence between the number of derivatives and the number of ﬁelds. The weight is equal
to twice the number of loops at which the corresponding counterterm may get generated
starting with the tree level Nambu–Goto action (or any other h = 0 classical action).

For example, Sf ree has h = 0, SP S4 and SP S6 interactions in (29) have h = 2. By
construction SP S does not contain h = 1 terms and all its h = 2 terms are uniquely ﬁxed
by universal one loop Nambu–Goto amplitudes. Terms with higher weight in SP S are not
uniquely ﬁxed, which corresponds to a freedom of choosing diﬀerent coeﬃcients for higher
order counterterms in the Nambu–Goto theory.

In particular, all h > 2 quartic vertices in SP S are completely free. Indeed, it is straight-
forward to check that in two dimensions all shift invariant quartic interactions with h > 2

11

can be written in such a way that there are at least two derivatives acting on each X. Given
that the extrinsic curvature of the string worldsheet takes the form

K i

αβ = ∂α∂βX i + . . . ,

any such term can be written in a form compatible with the non-linearly realized Poincar´e
symmetry [10]. Hence the number of free coeﬃcients for h > 2 quartic vertices in the
Nambu–Goto theory exactly matches the number of corresponding free coeﬃcients in the
undressed SP S theory. Hence any choice of h > 2 quartic vertices in SP S is consistent with
the Poincar´e symmetry of ˆSP S.
For example, we may set all these coeﬃcients to zero at weight h = 4, 6. With this
choice the four particle amplitude in ˆSP S up to (and including) O((cid:96)10
s ) order is the same
as in ˆS0 theory. It is straightforward to calculate these contributions. At O((cid:96)8
s) order four
particle amplitudes in the S0 theory are given by one loop ﬁsh diagrams with SP S4 vertices.
Evaluating these diagrams gives the following result,

The corresponding Poincar´e invariant amplitudes can be obtained by adding (30), (31) and
(32) to AP S4, BP S4 and CP S4 in (26), (27) and (28) and expanding the exponent up to O((cid:96)10
s ).
For the ﬁrst time in our calculations these amplitudes exhibit non-local real parts. As a
consequence the relation between annihilation A and reﬂection C amplitudes is now more
subtle than A = −C, as in (26), (28). In particular only the annihilation amplitude acquires
an imaginary part in the physical region. However, it is straightforward to check that the
crossing relation (8) holds, as it should be.

The dressing procedure allowed us to obtain a O((cid:96)10

s ) Poincar´e invariant amplitude cor-
responding to a particular choice of counterterms (which at this order include S1, S2 and
additional counterterms at O((cid:96)8
s )). In principle, it is a matter of straightforward
one loop and tree level calculations including these counterterms to extend the dressing ar-
guments above and to obtain an expression for the most general O((cid:96)10
s ) Poincar´e invariant
amplitude. We will not provide it here, but it is important to stress that these counterterms
cannot change the O((cid:96)8

s) logarithmic terms, so these are universal.

s) and O((cid:96)10

These logarithmic terms disappear at D = 4, which is related to the existence of integrable
non-Poincar´e invariant theories with annihilations constructed in [24], similarly to how the
absence of logarithmic terms at one loop is related to the existence of the GGRT theory. We
also checked that at three loops the D3 part of dressed amplitudes agrees with the brute force

as shown in Fig. 4, and also two and one loop diagrams with evanescent counterterms SE1,

5 Future Directions

It is quite surprising that in the Nambu–Goto theory relatively straightforward arguments
allow to arrive at what otherwise would be the result of a tedious four loop calculation.
Furthermore, the analytical structure of the result is surprisingly simple, albeit the scattering

13

is non-trivial. The main idea behind our arguments is to make use of the existence of certain
(semi)integrable theories, such as the GGRT theory, and the dressed Polchinski–Strominger.
In the future we plan to push these eﬀorts further. Ideally, one may hope that these methods
may be promoted into a systematic way of building up perturbative expansions around the
GGRT theory.

The results obtained in the current paper raise a number of questions. For instance, it is
interesting to understand in more details the structure of the undressed theory SP S. All its
h = 2 vertices are uniquely ﬁxed, and can be determined by inspecting multiparticle one loop
amplitudes in the Nambu–Goto theory. It appears feasible to calculate their explicit form
building up on the current algebra techniques of [10, 24]. At higher weights it is tempting to
speculate that it is consistent to set to zero all operators which do not get generated starting
from the h = 2 part of SP S. If true, this implies that there is a large family of operators in
the Nambu–Goto theory which do not exhibit logarithmic running, extending the two loop
operators S1, S2.

As far as a calculation of the two-to-two scattering amplitudes goes, in this paper we
reached a natural threshold. Starting from ﬁve loops two particle unitarity is violated and
one may expect the analytical structure of the amplitude to become more complicated.
Using the (un)dressing formalism, calculation of this amplitude requires evaluating of two-
loop diagrams with three SP S4 vertices and three loop diagrams with two SP S6 vertices (see
Figure 5). We plan to address these and other related questions in the near future.
