Data-driven Radiative Hydrodynamic Modeling of the 2014 March 29 X1.0

Solar Flare

ABSTRACT

Spectroscopic observations of solar ﬂares provide critical diagnostics of the physical conditions in the
ﬂaring atmosphere. Some key features in observed spectra have not yet been accounted for in existing
ﬂare models. Here we report a data-driven simulation of the well-observed X1.0 ﬂare on 2014 March
29 that can reconcile some well-known spectral discrepancies. We analyzed spectra of the ﬂaring region
from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) in Mg II h&k, the Interferometric BIdimensional
Spectropolarimeter at the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST/IBIS) in Hα 6563 Å and Ca II 8542 Å, and the
Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager (RHESSI) in hard X-rays. We constructed a
multi-threaded ﬂare loop model and used the electron ﬂux inferred from RHESSI data as the input to the
radiative hydrodynamic code RADYN to simulate the atmospheric response. We then synthesized various
chromospheric emission lines and compared them with the IRIS and IBIS observations. In general, the
synthetic intensities agree with the observed ones, especially near the northern footpoint of the ﬂare. The
simulated Mg II line proﬁle has narrower wings than the observed one. This discrepancy can be reduced
by using a higher microturbulent velocity (27 km s−1) in a narrow chromospheric layer.
In addition,
we found that an increase of electron density in the upper chromosphere within a narrow height range
of ≈ 800 km below the transition region can turn the simulated Mg II line core into emission and thus
reproduce the single peaked proﬁle, which is a common feature in all IRIS ﬂares.

Introduction

A large fraction of energy radiated from solar ﬂares
originates in the chromosphere. Studying the chro-
mospheric ﬂare emission is therefore a key for under-
standing how the ﬂare energy is transported and dissi-
pated.

Chromospheric emission was recorded during the
well observed X1.0 ﬂare on 2014 March 29 in the
wavelengths Hα, Ca
II 8542 Å with DST/IBIS
(Cavallini 2006) and in Mg II h&k with the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS; De Pontieu et al.

heights, the available data cover the whole chromo-
sphere and provide an excellent diagnostic for the ﬂare
response of the lower solar atmosphere. However,
many of these line proﬁles form in non-LTE condi-
tions, complicating their interpretation. This requires
detailed numerical modeling of the energy input, hy-
drodynamics, and radiative transfer.

Currently, there are very few non-LTE radiative
hydrodynamic codes to model the eﬀects of electron
heating on the atmosphere, for example RADYN (see
e.g. Carlsson & Stein 1997; Allred et al. 2005) and
FLARIX (Kaˇsparov´a et al. 2009)1.

Past studies using these codes have focused on the
atmospheric response to power-law electron beams
(Allred et al. 2005) and the eﬀects of XEUV back-

warming on the Ca II H and He I 10830 Å line proﬁles
(Allred et al. 2015). Comparisons with actual obser-
vations are rare. For example, Kennedy et al. (2015)
used the RADYN code to compare the temporal evo-
lution of the He II continuum emission with the one
observed by EVE MEGS-A during an X1.5 ﬂare or
Kuridze et al. (2015), who used it to study the evolu-
tion of Hα, but never made a direct comparison with
observations.

In our previous paper (Rubio da Costa et al. 2015a),
we studied an M3.0 class ﬂare and for the ﬁrst time
made a direct comparison of synthetic line proﬁles and
intensity emission in the chromosphere with observa-
tions in Hα 6563 Å and Ca II 8542 Å. Here we take
a further step by analyzing a well-observed X1.0 ﬂare,
by including more spectral lines, e.g. Mg II, now reg-
ularly observed by the IRIS spacecraft but never simu-
lated for ﬂares, and by making a detailed comparison
of spectral line shapes.

Our approach is to use the RADYN code to simu-
late how accelerated electrons propagate through the
solar atmosphere and how the atmosphere responds
to the energy deposited by the non-thermal electrons.
This allows us to model the dynamic evolution of loops
including their temperature and velocity structures and
spectral line emission because of the ﬂare. The elec-
tron heating is modeled self-consistently from X-ray
observations obtained by RHESSI.

We describe the relevant observations in Section 2
and the simulation setup in Section 3. The chromo-
spheric emission resulting from our modeling and the
comparison with observations are presented in Sec-
tions 4 and 5. A brief summary and some discussion
are presented in Section 6.

2. Observations

An X1.0 class ﬂare occurred on March 29, 2014
in active region NOAA 12017 (Kleint et al. 2015). It
started with a ﬁlament eruption at 17:35 UT, leading
to the ﬂare, which started at 17:45 UT and reached
its maximum at 17:48 UT in the GOES 1–8 Å ﬂux.
RHESSI detected X-ray emission from 17:35:28 to
18:14:36 UT, peaking at 17:47:18 UT (see Figure 1).

IBIS Observations

IBIS is a full-Stokes polarimeter based on two
air-spaced Fabry-Perot interferometers, with a plate
′′1 pixel−1 and spectral resolution of 22
scale of 0.
and 42 mÅ respectively for Hα and Ca II 8542 Å

and GOES 1–8 Å ﬂux. The two vertical dashed lines

of each spectrum.

(Reardon & Cavallini 2008). Windows of a few
Angstrom width around the selected spectral lines
are scanned using suitable pre-ﬁlters. Six polariza-
tion states are reconstructed into images of the four
Stokes parameters. We scanned the chromospheric
Ca II 8542 Å and Hα 6563 Å lines and the photo-
spheric Fe I 6302 Å line. Here we will focus on the
chromospheric emission from Hα and Ca II 8542 Å.
The relevant observations were started at 17:30:48 UT
and 17:48:08 UT. (see overview in Table 2.1). Their
main diﬀerence is the decrease of the exposure time
from 80 ms to 60 ms and thus their cadence to avoid
saturation due to the ﬂare. The IBIS data reduction in-
cludes dark and gain corrections, the alignment of all
channels, a destretch to correct for the variable seeing,
and a correction for the wavelength shift across the
ﬁeld of view due to the collimated Fabry Perot mount
and for the preﬁlter transmission proﬁle.

Hα observations were performed in intensity-only
mode (no polarization). Observations from 17:30 UT -

southern ribbon and blue for the northern ribbon) and just outside the ribbons (green).

17:47:31 UT were run with 5 repetitions of each of the
25 wavelength points, giving 125 images per sequence.
Each sequence took 18 s. From each ﬁve identical im-
ages, the one with the best seeing was selected, thus
assembling image cubes with 25 wavelength points for
the analysis. From 17:48:32 UT until the end of the ob-
servations, the repetitions of the Hα wavelength points
were omitted and sequences of 25 images were taken.
These sequences took about 4.3 s. Because all spectral
lines were scanned sequentially, the overall cadence of
the observation is 40-60 s.

The Ca II 8542 Å line was scanned in 21 wave-
length points with full-Stokes imaging, giving a total
of 126 images per sequence. Depending on the ex-
posure time (cf. Table 2.1), these took 15-18 s for a
complete line proﬁle.

Figures 2 and 3 shows the temporal evolution of the
Hα and Ca II 8542 Å line proﬁles respectively, at three
diﬀerent locations:
just outside the ribbons (green),
over the southern ribbon (purple) and in the north-
ern ribbon (blue) (for exact locations, see Figure 15).
The intensity calibration was performed comparing the
quiet Sun proﬁles with the ones from RADYN at the
same heliocentric angle (see Section 5.1 for more de-
tails).

IRIS Observations

Coordinated observations by IRIS were carried out
with an eight-step raster of 2′′ steps, yielding a FOV of
14′′ × 174′′. As shown in Figure 4 the IRIS slit (8 ver-
tical slit positions in diﬀerent colors) was positioned
across the ﬂare ribbons. Complementary slit-jaw im-
ages (SJI) were obtained with the ﬁlters at 1400 Å,
2796 Å, and 2832 Å. The raster cadence was 75 s,
while the exposure time of IRIS NUV spectra de-
creased from 8 s to 2.44 s at 17:46:13.98 UT. IRIS’

The IRIS 2796 Å SJI allowed us to estimate the
cross-sectional area of the footpoints in the chromo-

sphere. We selected the footpoints area as the emis-
sion above a threshold intensity of 1212 DN/s (see blue
contours in Figure 5), obtaining an area of the order of

1017 cm2. The evolution of the area of the footpoints
is shown in Figure 7(d), where the uncertainty in the
area is given by the pixel resolution (0′′.167) and the
temporal error bar is the integration time (8 s).

2.3. RHESSI Observations

RHESSI had full coverage of the impulsive phase of
the ﬂare (see Figure 1). Using the PIXON algorithm,
we reconstructed images at 30-70 keV integrated over
20 s intervals from 17:43:00 to 17:49:56 UT. These im-
ages revealed two HXR footpoints (see Figure 5). The
southern HXR source moved south-west and crossed
slits 3-7 from 17:45:35 UT to 17:46:40 UT (Liu et al.
2015).

2.3.1.

Inferring the non-thermal electron distribution

To derive the temporal evolution of the ﬂare, we
ﬁt the spatially integrated X-ray spectra. The HXR
emission from the corona is negligible compared to the
footpoints; therefore, we assume that the spatially in-
tegrated spectra are dominated by footpoint emission.
This provides a reasonable estimate for the electron en-
ergy ﬂux as an input to our RADYN simulation.

We analyzed the spectra of the detectors separately
and excluded detectors 2, 3, 7, and 8 because of ab-
normally high threshold and/or low energy resolu-
tion (Smith et al. 2002) and the higher than average
2 values obtained for the spectral ﬁtting. For each
χ
of the remaining ﬁve detectors, we obtained photon
spectra by integrating 30 s intervals from 17:45:00 to
17:49:56 UT, avoiding the change of attenuator from
A1 to A3 between 17:45:48 and 17:46:14. The time
interval of each spectrum are shown as vertical dotted-
dashed lines in Figure 1.

As Battaglia et al. (2015) showed, the pileup eﬀect
becomes important after ≈ 17:49:30 UT. Therefore
we applied corrections for instrumental emission lines,
pulse pileup and the detector response matrix (DRM).
The spectra were ﬁtted to a thermal component plus
a thick-target, non-thermal component consisting of a
broken power law. Figure 6 shows an example of a
spectrum from detector 1, taken between 17:46:12 and
17:46:28 UT during the impulsive phase, ﬁtted at low
energies to a thermal component and to a non-thermal
component at higher energies.

Averaging the spectral parameters of the non-
thermal electrons for all selected detectors, the re-
sulting power of electrons shows that its maximum
is reached before the peak in GOES X-ray ﬂux (Fig-
ure 7). This is because at later times the thermal com-
ponent contributes more to the total electron ﬂux.

To estimate the electron ﬂux, we divided the power
of non-thermal electrons by the cross-sectional area of
the footpoints in IRIS 2796 Å (Figure 7(d)) interpo-
lated to the times of each spectrum. Figure 7(e) shows
the temporal evolution of the ﬂux of non-thermal elec-
trons, which peaks at 17:45:39 UT, agreeing with the
ﬂux estimation of Battaglia et al. (2015). The ﬂux er-
ror bars have been calculated as the standard deviation
resulting from all the RHESSI detectors and the tem-
poral error bar show the integration time of each spec-
trum. The average cutoﬀ energy and spectral index in
Figure 7(a) and Figure 7(b), together with the electron
energy ﬂux in Figure 7(e) are the input parameters for
our RADYN simulation described next.

and red lines show the thermal, non-thermal, and to-
tal ﬁtting components. The two vertical dotted lines
mark the energy range over which the spectral ﬁt was
performed. The bottom panel shows the ﬁt residuals
normalized by the one-sigma uncertainties.

3. RADYN Simulations

We used the RADYN code of Carlsson & Stein

(1997), including the modiﬁcations of Abbett & Hawley
(1999) and Allred et al. (2005), to simulate the radiative-
hydrodynamic response of
the lower atmosphere
to energy deposition by non-thermal electrons in
a ﬂare loop, following the same description as in
Rubio da Costa et al. (2015a). The line transitions
treated in detail are listed in Table 1 of Abbett & Hawley
(1999).

3.1. Simulation Setup

We assumed a single quarter circle loop geometry
of 10 Mm height with a diameter of 4 × 108 cm2 as
determined from the IRIS observations, in a plane-
parallel model atmosphere. As a boundary condition,
we assumed reﬂection at the loop apex and an open
boundary at the bottom of the loop.

The initial atmosphere (red line in Figure 8) is a
modiﬁcation of the FP2 model of Abbett & Hawley
(1999), where the temperature was ﬁxed at 106 K at
the loop top and decreases at the bottom of the loop,
such that the photospheric temperature closely ﬁts the
one of the Sun (5780 K; Fraknoi et al. 2000). The

sentation of this particular ﬂare.

Hock et al. (2012) applied the idea of multi-thread
simulations by describing a number of free param-
eters, adjusted to match the observed coronal emis-
sion. Longcope et al. (2010) constrained the heating
rate and duration of each thread using a reconnection
model and comparing the estimated coronal radiation
with observations. Qiu et al. (2012) employed multi-
threads and estimated the ﬂare heating from ultravio-
let light curves. Moreover, as Falewicz et al. (2015)
have argued, applying a continuous heating ﬂux vari-
able in time along a single loop would be considered
the debatable extreme case of a multithread structure
of loops with a ﬁlling factor of 1.

Here we adopted the idea of multithread structure of
loops by running the RADYN code at diﬀerent times
applying the heating rate estimated from the RHESSI
spectra as explained in Section 2.3.1. The essential
diﬀerence between multi-thread and a uniform loop is
that each new simulation, representing a new thread,
starts from the initial atmosphere of Figure 8 and initial
conditions explained in Section 3.1.

As Warren (2006) discussed, the time scale of each
individual thread would be of the order of 60 to 80 sec-
onds. These pulses are in fact seen in other instruments
(see e.g. Aschwanden et al. 2007; Falewicz 2014), in-
dicative of distinct heating events.
In this paper we
assume that the spikes shown in the time derivative of
the GOES 1-8 Å light curve (Figure 9) correspond to
single bursts. This idea has been previously investi-
gated by Warren & Antiochos (2004), based on the as-
sumption that there is a linear correlation between the
peak in the time derivative of the soft X-rays and the
non-thermal emission, i.e. the so called Neupert eﬀect
(Neupert 1968).

By assuming that each burst is due to a new thread,
we have estimated that this ﬂare is composed of 16
diﬀerent threads starting at the times indicated by the
vertical dashed lines of Figure 9. The duration of each
spike in the GOES time derivative deﬁnes the heating
phase of each thread; three times this duration is as-
sumed to be the relaxation phase when electron heat-
ing is turned oﬀ but the atmosphere is allowed to relax.
We use these time scales as a proxy for the lifetime of
the heating phase on individual threads. The assump-
tion that each spike is a single burst seems to be a rea-
sonable approximation and agrees with the time scales
found by Warren (2006). One could also use RHESSI
hard X-ray light curves to estimate the duration of one
thread. The main spikes in the GOES derivative are

Fig. 8.— Logarithm of the temperature as function
of column mass for the modiﬁed pre-ﬂare atmosphere
used in this paper (red) and the semiempirial VALC
model from Vernazza et al. (1981) (blue dashed).

Our modiﬁed atmosphere has a lower temperature,
density and pressure in the chromosphere than the
FP2 model of Abbett & Hawley (1999) and is cooler
and has lower electron density than the VALC qui-
escent state from Vernazza et al. (1981). The contin-
uum emission ﬁts to a Planck function with a pho-
tospheric temperature of 5806 K, optimally ﬁtting
the pre-ﬂare continuum emission observed at four
wavelength bands from the UV to the IR: at 1333 Å
(IRIS FUV), 2825 Å (IRIS NUV), 6173 Å (SDO HMI),
and 10840 Å (DST/FIRS) (see Kleint et al. 2016, for
more details). The continuum in the IRIS FUV and
NUV is formed at lower temperatures (higher in the
atmosphere), and therefore these points are expected
to lie below the ﬁtted Planck function.

The non-thermal electron heating estimated from
RHESSI (see Section 2.3.1) was included in RA-
DYN as a source of external heating in the equation
of internal energy conservation (for more details see
Rubio da Costa et al. 2015a).

3.2. Multi-thread setup

The impulsive phase of the ﬂare lasts about four
minutes, but it is unlikely that ﬂare-accelerated par-
ticles precipitate down in a single ﬂux loop for the
duration of the entire impulsive phase (Warren 2006;
Qiu et al. 2010). Moreover, the footpoints move about
15 arcsec south-west during the ﬂare, so the assump-
tion of a single thread loop would not be a good repre-

will be compared to observations in Section 5.

We follow the same procedure for comparing the
Hα emission with synthetic RADYN line proﬁles as
Rubio da Costa et al. (2015a). As explained in their
paper, centrally reversed proﬁles are a consequence of
the combination of several eﬀects: the behavior of the
temperature stratiﬁcation at the height where the line
core is formed, together with the sudden change in the
response of the source function within a very thin at-
mospheric layer. The comparison with observations
was done for the available data limited to a particular
time step during the gradual phase of the ﬂare. Here
we study the temporal evolution of the line proﬁle dur-
ing the whole duration of the ﬂare, and as discussed
in Section 3.2, we include sequentially heated threads
instead of a single loop continuously heated.

We calculate the intensity for each individual thread
and, considering that all the threads equally contribute
to the total intensity, we temporally averaged the in-
tensity at each wavelength position for all the threads
contributing at a speciﬁc time interval.

Fig. 9.— Time derivative of the GOES 1-8 Å light
curve. The red dashed lines indicate the beginning and
end of each individual thread.

temporally coaligned with those in the 25-50 keV ﬂux,
which justiﬁes our usage of the GOES derivative.

Considering that the ﬂux of electrons estimated at
each time interval in Section 2.3.1 (see Figure 7(e)) is
the total ﬂux of the whole footpoint, the ﬂux of the
heating phase of each single thread was calculated by
multiplying the ﬂux of electrons by the trend in the
GOES time derivative, such that the total ﬂux of the
threads in a given time interval agrees with the total
ﬂux for the same interval estimated from the RHESSI
spectra.

Table 3.2 shows the duration of the heating and re-
laxing phase of each single thread. The temporal evo-
lution of each simulation agrees with the timescales
previously reported by Li et al. (2015) in the dynamics
of the ﬂare ribbons.

The total contribution to the ﬂare is the result
of temporally adding up all the sequentially heated
threads magnetically conﬁned within our simulated
1D ﬂare loop model. In this way we construct a multi-
thread model of the Sun’s atmospheric response and
emission produced during the ﬂare, as in the spatial
evolution of a ﬂare arcade.

4. Synthetic chromospheric emission

In this section we will present the chromospheric
emission in Hα and Ca II 8542 Å, resulting from the
RADYN simulations (Section 4.1) and in Mg II h&k,
resulting from the RH code (Section 4.2). The results

indicates the center of the lines. Note: the intensity scales for Hα and Ca II 8542 Å are diﬀerent.

4.1. Formation and Evolution of the Hα and

Ca II 8542 Å Spectral Lines

Focusing ﬁrst on the Hα emission, Figure 10 shows
the temporal evolution of the averaged line proﬁle (red
proﬁles). During the impulsive phase, the synthetic
Hα proﬁle is in emission, often showing a central re-
versal. The reversal results from a sudden change of
the source function behavior at the height where the
line core is formed. After 52 seconds, the line pro-
ﬁle shows an asymmetry: the blue shifted peak of the
line becomes stronger and the line is shifted to higher
wavelengths (Figure 10(d)). Closer to the peak of the
ﬂare the red wing of the line becomes stronger and the
line center shows a shift towards lower wavelengths
(Figure 10(e)).

The Ca II 8542 Å line proﬁle (blue proﬁles of Fig-
ure 10) responds similarly to plasma motions. During
the impulsive phase, the synthetic Ca II 8542 Å pro-
ﬁle is in emission and is more sensitive to plasma ve-
locities than Hα. After 20 seconds, the line shows
a secondary small peak at high wavelengths, due to
downﬂow velocities of the order of 30 km s−1 from
the contributing threads 1 and 2 in the upper chromo-
sphere, below the region where the core of the line is
formed. At later times, closer to the ﬂare peak (Fig-
ure 10(e)) the core of the line shows asymmetries on
the red side due to downﬂow velocities in the upper

chromosphere, exactly in the core formation region. In
the gradual phase of the ﬂare (Figure 10(h)), the line
proﬁle is fainter, but still above the continuum emis-
sion.

Vernazza et al. (1981) (and recently Kuridze et al.
2015, in ﬂares) found that the Ca II 8542 Å line is
formed deeper in the atmosphere than Hα. Moreover,
their simulated proﬁle shows a weak downﬂow at the
height of core formation which shifts the line center to
the red, agreeing with our proﬁles close to the peak of
the ﬂare.

We selected a speciﬁc time interval (17:47:00 UT)
to analyze how the emission of each single thread con-
tributes to the total intensity at each wavelength range.
As Table 4.1 shows, at 17:47:00 UT the total intensity
is formed by the contribution of the threads 6 and 7 in
their relaxing phase (after 38 and 19 seconds of simu-
lation) and thread 8 in its heating phase (after 1 second)
with a non-thermal electron heating of 3.6 × 1010 erg
s−1 cm−2. The line proﬁles of each single contributing
thread and the averaged line proﬁle are shown in Fig-
ure 11 for Hα (panel a), Ca II 8542 Å (panel b), and
Mg II k (panel c).

Asymmetries generally result from velocities, es-
pecially downﬂows during the ﬂare maximum. As an
example, the line proﬁle resulting from thread 6 (blue
line) in Figure 11 shows a stronger red peak due to
downﬂows of almost 15 km s−1 (see right panel in Fig-

9

ure 12). In the gradual phase, the Hα proﬁle returns to
absorption. Table 4.1 shows which threads contribute
to the averaged line proﬁle (green line in Fig. 11) at
the selected time steps. The evolution times of the in-
dividual threads are given in the legend.

Kuridze et al. (2015) studied the Hα emission dur-
ing an M1.1 class ﬂare and stressed that the red and
blue shifts visible in the line proﬁle may not be as-
sociated with plasma down- and upﬂows. They also
found that the core of the line remains unshifted before
the ﬂare and shows redshifts after the ﬂare maximum,
agreeing with the behavior of our synthetic Hα pro-
ﬁles.

The Hα line proﬁle of thread 6 shows a reversal in
the center due to the sudden change of the source func-
tion at 1.3 Mm, where the photons of the line core are
formed. This is due to the temperature stratiﬁcation at
this height (i.e. right below the beginning of the transi-
tion region). Similarly, in thread 7, this change occurs
at 1.1 Mm; where the source function separates from
the Planck function, changing the direction drastically
with frequencies.

In general,

the asymmetry in the core of both

10

Hα and Ca II 8542 Å proﬁles, is the results of the
velocity distribution at the formation height of the line
core (see the velocity distribution in Figure 12).

The Ca

II 8542 Å line proﬁle resulting from
threads 6 and 7, both show an asymmetry in the line
core due to downﬂow velocities in the region where
the line core is formed (which is very similar to the
one of Hα); while the line proﬁle resulting from
thread 8 during the beginning of its impulsive phase
shows a symmetric proﬁle because the photons at the
core of the line are formed at a lower height than in
Hα (≈1.05 Mm); therefore the downﬂow velocities
do not aﬀect the line proﬁle. In general, the photons
formed in the wings of the Ca II 8542 Å line proﬁle are
formed in a layer above those of Hα; while the core
formation of both lines is located roughly at the same
height.

To study how the atmosphere behaves in the up-
per chromosphere, Figure 12 shows the stratiﬁcation
in height of the temperature (red), electron density
(blue) and velocity (green) for the diﬀerent threads
contributing to the total ﬂaring emission at 17:47:00
UT: thread 6 after 38 seconds (left), thread 7 after 19
seconds (middle) and thread 8 after 1 second (right).
The threads 6 and 7 are already in their relaxing phase;
while in thread 8 the electrons are starting to interact
with the atmosphere.

The temperature in the corona of thread 6 is de-
creasing; the pressure work has pushed the transition
region towards lower layers (1.28 Mm) with respect
to the initial times (1.57 Mm). The atmosphere of
thread 7 is starting its gradual phase; the temperature
in the corona is decreasing, the electron density is sta-
ble in the corona and decreasing in the chromosphere.
The atmosphere resulting from thread 8 is at the begin-
ning of its impulsive phase, therefore the atmosphere
is very similar to the one in HD equilibrium.

4.2. Formation and Evolution of the Mg II h&k

Spectral Lines

As Leenaarts et al. (2013) pointed out, due to the
low chromospheric density, the time average between
collisions is larger than the lifetime of an Mg II ion in
the upper levels of the lines. For this reason, the fre-
quency of emitted and absorbed photons in scattering
processes is correlated and the assumption of complete
frequency redistribution (CRD) is not valid. There-
fore, the Mg II h&k lines in the quiet Sun and plage
are strongly aﬀected by the eﬀect of partial frequency

Fig. 11.— Hα line, Ca II 8542 Å proﬁles (from RADYN) and Mg II k proﬁles (from RH) at 17:47:00 UT (green) and

redistribution (PRD). Since RADYN calculates the
emission of the Mg II lines assuming CRD, we employ
the RH code (Pereira & Uitenbroek 2015; Uitenbroek
2001) to calculate the Mg II emission with PRD. We
perform non-LTE radiative transfer computations with
a modiﬁed version of the RH code, which includes the
heating due to the injection of electrons in the atmo-
sphere. This code treats the eﬀects of angle-dependent
PRD using the fast approximation by Leenaarts et al.
(2012).

We considered a time series of 1D hydrodynamical
snapshots computed with RADYN with a timescale
of 1 second, which is shorter than the timescale for
ionization/recombination and used a 10 level plus
continuum model atom for Mg II as described in
Leenaarts et al. (2013). We compared the RH calcula-
tion with PRD to the RADYN calculation with CRD
for our ﬂare proﬁles. We found that while PRD eﬀects
are still important, their inﬂuence on ﬂare proﬁles is
much smaller than on those of the quiet Sun.

Kerr et al. (2015) studied the formation of the 3p-
3d level subordinate lines for an M1.8 class ﬂare and
found that they usually appear in absorption outside
the ﬂaring region but show a signiﬁcant enhance-
ment during a solar ﬂare, agreeing with our ﬁndings.
Pereira et al. (2015) found that these optically thick
lines are formed in the lower chromosphere, and that
they appear in emission when there is a large temper-
ature gradient (≥1500 K) throughout a wide range of
heights in the chromosphere.

In the following discussion, we will focus only on
the Mg II k line, as the Mg II h line behaves nearly
identically. Figure 13 shows the temporal evolution of
the Mg II k intensity resulting from the total contribu-
tion of all the threads. The line proﬁle shows two clear
emission peaks and a well deﬁned central depression.
At initial times (see panel (a) in Figure 13) the line
is symmetric with a reversal in the core. After 20 sec-
onds (panel (b)) the blue peak becomes stronger and
the intensity in the core increases, due to strong up-

line center.

ﬂows in the upper chromosphere resulting from the
impulsive phase of thread 2. After 60 seconds (Fig-
ure 13(e)) the line core show a strong red peak due
to downﬂow velocities and two minor peaks at lower
wavelengths in the core associated to upﬂow veloci-
ties of two diﬀerent threads. During the gradual phase
of the ﬂare (Figure 13(h)), the intensity decreases and
the proﬁle shows the typical core reversal; plasma mo-
tions in the upper chromosphere are responsible of the
asymmetries in the line proﬁle.

4.2.1. Formation of the Mg II line emission

To better understand how the line proﬁles are
formed and how they respond to the atmospheric
changes, we analyze the formation of the Mg II k pro-
ﬁles in detail (Figure 14) using four-panel formation
diagrams previously used by Carlsson & Stein (1997),
showing the intensity contribution function and its
diﬀerent components as a function of frequency and
height.

We investigate how the atmospheric stratiﬁcation
aﬀects the formation of the line proﬁle and where in
the atmosphere the line is formed by separating the for-
mal solution of the transfer equation for emergent in-
tensity in diﬀerent terms (Equation 1 Carlsson & Stein
1997). This decomposition shows that the maximum
of the intensity contribution function is located at
heights with high source function and at low optical

depth, around optical depth unity.

tion at height z.

As shown in Figure 14 that while the line proﬁle
resulting from thread 6 is formed within a height range
between 0.9 Mm (photons contributing to the wings,
at 1 Å from the line center) and 1.46 Mm (photons
contributing to the core of the line); most of the Mg II k
photons of thread 7 are formed within a height range
between 0.8 (at the wings, 1 Å from the line center)
and 1.73 Mm (in the core of the line); the line proﬁle
resulting from thread 8 during its impulsive phase is
formed in a narrower height region, between 0.77 (at
the wings, 1 Å from the line center) and 1.23 Mm (in
the core of the line).

The source function panel in Figure 14 of these
three threads clearly demonstrates the frequency-

(middle) and thread 8 after 1 second (right). Each image shows the quantity speciﬁed in its top-left corner as a function

top axis is the wavelength from line center and the vertical axis, the height in Mm from the bottom of the loop.
Multiplication of the ﬁrst three panels produces the intensity contribution function in the fourth panel. The τν = 1

shows the Planck function (black dotted line) and the line source function along the τν = 1 curve in blue for the part

dependence of the line source function in temperature
units caused by PRD eﬀects. The blue line represents
the source function along the τν = 1 curve for the
part of the τ curve blueward of its maximum value;
while the red line shows the part on the red side of the
maximum τν = 1 height. One can see that in thread 6
both lines are decoupled at almost all heights in the
chromosphere (between 0.95 and 1.45 Mm, showing
the importance of PRD. For thread 7, although the
blue and red components of the source function fol-
low the same trend, they are clearly independent. The
contribution of thread 8 becomes signiﬁcant after one
second of heating, during its impulsive phase. The
red and blue components do not diﬀer, indicating that
PRD eﬀects at this time are not as critical as for the
other two contributing threads.

The shape of the line proﬁle of thread 6 indicates
that, although the line does not show a strong asym-
metry in the wings, the core is shifted towards higher
wavelengths. This is due to the downﬂow plasma ve-
locity (negative values) between ≈ 1.2 and 1.36 Mm.
The core reversal is due to the sudden increase of the
source function, changing the direction at 1.46 Mm,
where the photons of the line core are formed. This is
related to the temperature stratiﬁcation at this height,
shortly below the transition region. The secondary
peak at 27 km s−1 is due to a small temperature in-
crease at 1.23 Mm, as shown in Figure 12.

The line proﬁle resulting from thread 7 shows a
stronger red peak, due to the downﬂow velocities at
1.64 Mm.

The third panel of Figure 14 shows a symmetric line
proﬁle resulting from thread 8 at the beginning of the
impulsive phase. The upﬂowing velocities shown at
1.62 Mm of Figure 12(c) do not aﬀect the shape of the
line because the formation height of the core is located
in a lower region, at 1.23 Mm.

5. Comparison with observations

In general the synthetic line proﬁles are narrower
than the observed ones. We applied a constant mi-
croturbulent velocity of 4.5 km s−1 to the Hα and
Ca II 8542 Å lines to simulate the eﬀects of unre-
solved turbulent motions and a microturbulent velocity
of 10 km s−1 to the Mg II h&k line proﬁles.

Observations of He I 10830 Å were omitted from
the comparison because the RADYN code was run
without the recent addition of XEUV backwarming
from Allred et al. (2015), which has a signiﬁcant in-
ﬂuence on helium line proﬁles.

5.1. Hα and Ca II 8542 Å Line Proﬁles

We averaged the RADYN model intensities at each
wavelength for 3 seconds (the duration of the IBIS line
core observations) to compare the synthetic Hα and

13

Fig. 15.— Hα and Ca II 8542 Å line proﬁle for RADYN (black solid line) and IBIS at 17:46:13 UT+18 s and
17:45:54 UT+18 s, respectively, and at diﬀerent locations along the ribbons of the ﬂare (purple for the southern ribbon
and blue for the northern ribbon) and outside (green). The black dotted line is the IBIS quiet Sun proﬁle calibrated to
RADYN.

Ca II 8542 Å proﬁles with the observations.

To properly compare the RADYN proﬁles with
IBIS, we convolved the RADYN quiet Sun proﬁles
with a Gaussian with FWHM of 0.028 Å for Hα and
0.049 Å for Ca II 8542 Å, to ﬁt it to the quiet Sun
observed proﬁles. This broadening may be considered
as the eﬀect introduced by the microturbulence in the
real observations and was applied to all corresponding
RADYN data. Finally, to convert the IBIS data into
physical units, we matched the IBIS quiet Sun to that
of RADYN and applied the conversion factor to the
IBIS ﬂare data.

Figure 15 shows the comparison of IBIS and RA-
DYN for Hα (left panels) and Ca II 8542 Å (right
panels) for one timestep during the impulsive phase
(given in the ﬁgure). The top row shows intensity im-
ages in the respective wavelengths of the line core with
RHESSI contours of [30, 50, 80]% overplotted in grey.
The crosses indicate color-coded locations for which
observed proﬁles are plotted in the bottom row. Each
observed proﬁle was averaged over 0.
′′4 (4 × 4
pixels). Because of the large variation of the observed
proﬁles, we plot them for three diﬀerent locations in-
stead of averaging over the whole RHESSI contour.
The averaged contour strongly depends on the selected
level and is therefore hard to compare to the simu-

′′4 × 0.

lations. The purple proﬁles come from the strongest
emission region in the southern ribbon/footpoint and
their intensity is higher than RADYN’s, especially in
the line wings. The blue proﬁles, which come from
the northern ribbon/footpoint, agree well with the sim-
ulation, both in line intensity and in line width. While
the line core seems to have an extra bump in Hα ob-
servations, this could be due to an unresolved compo-
nent or possibly because it took several seconds to scan
the whole line proﬁle and the ribbon may evolve faster
than this timescale. The observations show larger line
wing intensities, which are not reproduced in the sim-
ulations. Especially the red wing seems to be higher
in observations, indicating missing downﬂows in the
simulations.

Comparing the temporal evolution of both ob-
served (Figures 2 and 3) and synthetic intensities (Fig-
ure 10), the maximum intensity occurs at the same
time, although the intensity resulting from RADYN
is ≈ a factor of 2 higher in Hα (and slightly less in
Ca II 8542 Å). While the decay phase seems to be
constant, keeping the lines in emission for minutes, in
RADYN it occurs faster, concluding that the heating of
electrons during the gradual phase of the ﬂares is not
enough to keep the chromospheric lines in emission.

Fig. 16.— Left: Evolution of the Mg II h&k line proﬁles (black-red-blue). More northern proﬁles were crossed by
the hard X-ray source earlier, indicating they are in a later stage of their evolution due to the ﬂare. Right: Comparison
of RH (black) and observations (red). The observations were averaged over half of the 80% RHESSI contours, whose
location is indicated with red stripes in the inset that shows the Mg spectrum. The lower half of the 80% contour did
not show any ﬂare-related Mg proﬁles, presumably because it takes a few seconds for the atmosphere to heat, which
is why only the upper half of the contour was used for the comparison.

5.2. Mg II h&k Line Proﬁles

The comparison of the Mg II line proﬁles is more
complex than the above chromospheric lines for two
reasons: because the observations covered only the
south-western footpoint (see Figure 4) and because the
lines are formed in a broad height range in the chro-
mosphere and small diﬀerences in the simulated atmo-
sphere below the transition region result in large dif-
ferences in the core of the line proﬁles.

The evolution of the Mg II line proﬁles near the
hard X-ray footpoints follows a common scheme:
At ﬁrst, the intensity of the line increases abruptly,
showing strong downﬂows i.e. enhancements in the
red wing, the subordinate Mg II triplet lines change
from absorption into emission. At this time, the cen-
tral reversal is still visible in the h and k lines. A few
seconds later, the intensities decrease and the line pro-
ﬁles show only a single peak, a feature that is not at
all common on disk in quiet Sun proﬁles. The sin-
gle peak persists for several minutes (in our case for
8 minutes, until the end of the observations), while
the intensities are slowly decreasing. This behavior
is shown in the left panel of Figure 16.
Instead of
plotting the temporal evolution from diﬀerent rasters,
which have a relatively slow 75 s cadence, we plot
three diﬀerent spatial positions from the same raster
at 17:46:14 UT. Because the hard X-ray source was
moving south, these positions can be understood as
a temporal evolution after the bombardment of elec-
trons. As can be seen from Figure 13, RADYN does

not reproduce the strong downﬂows, nor the single-
peaked proﬁles.

The right panel of Figure 16 shows a direct compar-
ison of IRIS and RH at 17:46:14 UT, during the impul-
sive phase. The IRIS data were averaged over half of
the 80% RHESSI contour. This can be seen from the
inset, which shows the Mg spectrum versus the solar
latitude. The horizontal lines indicate the northern and
southern borders of the [50, 80 ,90]% RHESSI con-
tours in the colors purple, red, and blue, respectively.
The red shaded area indicates the location used for the
average of the IRIS data. The RH simulations (black)
were taken at the same time step for a proper compar-
ison. While the intensities agree relatively well, the
line shape and the broadening width obviously do not:
our synthetic proﬁle shows a reversal line core and nar-
row line proﬁles, while the the observations present a
single peak and a broader proﬁle in the line wings.

The Mg II h&k lines have very broad wings due to
their large opacity in the photosphere (Leenaarts et al.
2013). Moreover 3D eﬀects are very important espe-
cially in the line core. In the following section we try a
phenomenological procedures to see how the discrep-
ancies can be alleviated.

5.2.1. Testing the discrepancy between the synthetic

and observed proﬁles

To investigate the reasons for the shape discrep-
ancy, we iteratively modiﬁed the RADYN atmosphere
and simulated the eﬀects with the RH code. By doing

15

Fig. 17.— Atmospheric stratiﬁcation resulting from RADYN for thread 3 at 12 seconds (blue) and the modiﬁed one
provided to the RH code (red). [Left]: Microturbulent velocity as a function of height; [Middle]: Electron density

modiﬁed (red) atmospheres.

that we aim to explore how the line responds to at-
mospheric variations and to constrain the atmospheric
structure during solar ﬂares. There are four height-
dependent parameters that aﬀect the line intensity and
shape: temperature, electron density, velocity, and mi-
croturbulence. We found that a signiﬁcantly increased
microturbulence is needed to reproduce the broad line
wings from the observations; we increased the micro-
turbulent velocity up to 27 km s−1 in a narrow region
of ≈ 800 km, lower in the chromosphere, where the
line wings are formed (higher microturbulent veloc-
ities would distort the line core). This can be un-
derstood as highly increased turbulence during ﬂares,
which is not included in the 1D RADYN simulation.
The formation of this line proﬁle illustrates the intri-
cate formation properties of the Mg II h&k line cores.
We found that the cores of the Mg II h&k lines
are sensitive to modiﬁcation of the temperature and
electron density in a very narrow region of less than
100 km below the transition region. By increasing
the temperature the lines become fainter; while the in-
crease of the electron density in this narrow region in-
creases the intensity of the Mg II lines.

In order to get a single peak the electron density
has to be increased by almost a factor of 10 shortly
below the transition region (see Figure 17). For a bet-
ter interpretation of the line formation, the right panel
of Figure 17 shows the source and Planck function as
function of height for the original line proﬁle with a
core reversal (blue) and the line proﬁle showing a sin-

gle peak core, resulting from the modiﬁed atmosphere
(red). By increasing the electron density the source
function couples to the Planck function, explaining
why the core of the line turns into emission.

To match the observed Mg II emission, the ratio
between Mg II h and Mg II k should be close to one
in the model, otherwise the core of the line would be
formed in an optically thin environment. The core of
the lines is formed in a optically thick region where the
densities are so high that the source function does not
drop. Carlsson et al. (2015) studied how the tempera-
ture and density aﬀects these lines in plages and found
that by modifying the location of the chromospheric
temperature rise towards deeper layers, the core of
the Mg II becomes wider. While in speciﬁc cases a
change of temperature may aﬀect the core reversal, the
density is equally important. Therefore the results of
Carlsson et al. (2015) may be too simplistic for solar
ﬂares.

In Figure 18 we compare the resulting line proﬁle
with the IRIS observations. While the intensities of the
synthetic proﬁles are higher and the line wings nar-
rower, it nevertheless is the ﬁrst simulation reproduc-
ing the single peaks of Mg, commonly observed during
most ﬂares. The higher intensity could be explained as
a strong coupling to the local temperature due to high
densities.

To account for the whole shape of the line width,
one require a line proﬁle consisting of two diﬀerent
gaussians: one with a smaller width similar to that ob-

16

tained with RH (with a FWHM of ≈0.4 Å) and a sec-
ond broader one with a FWHM of ≈1.3 Å, correspond-
ing to a velocity higher than 80 km s−1.

Fig. 18.— Comparison of the IRIS Mg II h&k line
proﬁles (black) with those from the RH code, with a
modiﬁed electron density (red) and micruturbulent ve-
locity (blue) as shown in Figure 17.

Another discrepancy is the emission in between
lines: the simulated emission in the wings of the line is
much lower than in observations. One possible reason
is that RH calculates the opacity of the transitions only
in the selected atoms, therefore we may underestimate
the opacities.

6. Summary and Discussion

In this paper, we have presented a radiative hydro-
dynamic simulation of an X1.0 class ﬂare and a direct
comparison with high-resolution spectroscopic obser-
vations in the chromosphere in Hα and Ca II 8542 Å
by IBIS and in Mg II by IRIS. The temporal variation
of the ﬂux of non-thermal electrons was inferred from
RHESSI X-ray spectra and the structure of the initial
atmosphere was constrained using the available con-
tinuum emission before the ﬂare at four wavelength
bands from the UV to the IR.

An important improvement with respect to our pre-
vious work, Rubio da Costa et al. (2015a), is the in-
clusion of multi-threaded simulations, using the time
derivative of the GOES 1–8 Å light curve to estimate
the duration of each thread. Multi-thread simulations
are more realistic because it is unlikely that only one
loop contributes to the observed X-ray emission.

A direct comparison of the line proﬁles was per-
formed at diﬀerent times. The synthetic intensity val-

ues generally match observations in the chromosphere
(Hα, Ca II 8542 Å and Mg II k). The Hα, Ca II 8542 Å
synthetic proﬁles ﬁt in shape to the observations, while
the Mg II line proﬁles observed by IRIS are broader
in the wings than the synthetic ones. Additionally,
ﬂare observations generally show a single peak in Mg,
while RADYN simulations (and any other simulations
to date) show two peaks, similar to observations out-
side of ﬂare regions. By iteratively modifying the RA-
DYN atmosphere, we found that we could reproduce
the observed single-peaked Mg ﬂare spectra with a
strong increase in density below the TR. The too nar-
row simulated line wings can be interpreted as a lack of
microturbulent motions in the simulations at the lower
chromosphere, or could also possibly be due to 3D ef-
fects, not included in the 1D RADYN and RH codes.
By increasing the microturbulence in the upper chro-
mosphere the wings of the simulated Mg II line pro-
ﬁles ﬁt the observed broad lines better, but we are still
missing a broader component to account for the obser-
vations.

The Mg II h&k line proﬁles show a complex for-
mation behavior that spans the entire chromosphere.
The variations in temperature, density, and velocity in
the chromosphere produce diverse line shapes. The
Mg II emission is extremely sensitive to changes in a
very narrow height range.

The estimated cutoﬀ energy resulting from ﬁtting
the RHESSI spectra is an upper limit, resulting in a
lower limit of the ﬂux of electrons.
Increasing the
electron ﬂux would not help, since it would result in
higher intensities in the chromosphere as well and our
intensity values are already matching the observations,
being slightly higher at certain times.

Our simulation can be improved in the future by
including the acceleration and transport of particles:
coupling RADYN with the FLARE particle transport
and acceleration code (Rubio da Costa et al. 2015b)
results in stronger downﬂows, which may inﬂuence the
asymmetries in the chromospheric line proﬁles. The
inclusion of the improved backwarming component of
Allred et al. (2015) would reduce the intensity of the
lines.
