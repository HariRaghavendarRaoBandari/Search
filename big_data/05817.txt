Extending a comment coming from [D Chiuchi`u and G. Gubbiotti, arXiv:1512.07464, accepted
for publication], we prove a recursive formula which allows to describe the dynamics of a gas enclosed
by a piston and in contact with a thermal reservoir when both the external force and the reservoir
temperature are slowly varying over time. To do so, we use the model from [Cerino et al., Phys. Rev.
E, 91 032128] and a regular perturbation technique. The obtained formulas allow to recursively
calculate the heat exchanged with the reservoir with an arbitrary precision.

I.

INTRODUCTION

One of the main goals of non-equilibrium thermody-
namics is to understand how a thermodynamic system
evolves over time [1–3]. The problem is diﬃcult even in
the simplest physical examples [4] and for the same sys-
tem there can be multiple valid descriptions [5, 6]. For
example Cerino et al.
[5] proposed a set of equations
to describe the time evolution of a perfect gas enclosed
by a cylindrical canister with a movable piston and in
contact with a heat reservoir.
In this model only two
macroscopic variables and two external control parame-
ters are required: respectively the piston position and the
gas temperature, and the applied external force and the
reservoir temperature. In a recent paper [7] we showed
that the equations obtained in the linear regime in [5]
can be cast in the following dimensionless form:

where x is the dimensionless piston position, T the di-
mensionless gas temperature, Θ the dimensionless exter-
nal force, Ω the dimensionless reservoir temperature and

ε =r N m

(2)

the ratio between the total mass of the gas N m and the
mass of the piston M . Here x, T , Ω and Θ are func-
tions of the dimensionless time t, upper dots denotes t-
derivatives, and ε can be treated as a small perturbation
parameter [4]. Relevant thermodynamic quantities are
described by

(3b)

being E the energy density of the gas-piston system[8]
and Q the heat density exchanged with the reservoir.

Assuming that the the reservoir temperature is con-
stant (w.l.o.g. Ω = 1) and that Θ is slowly varying over
time, we were able to ﬁnd analytic approximated solu-
tions to eq.(1) with the multiple scales method [9–12].
As a general statement, any function B can be consid-
ered “slow” if

∂B/∂t ∝ εg

for g ≥ 1.

(4)

The simplest way to satisfy this condition is to take
B = B(εt), which we assume from now on on any slow
function we consider.

The aforementioned analytic solutions were used to de-
rive an approximated expression for the heat exchanged
with the reservoir in two physically relevant cases: the re-
laxation to equilibrium (Θ(εt) = 1) and the slow isother-
mal compression (Θ(εt) = 1 + εt). In [7] we also found
a particular solution emerging when all the integration
constants are taken to be zero, i.e.

xd.eq.(t) =

with prime notation

(6)

We called this solution a dynamical equilibrium solution
as it describes the piston position when it slowly follows
the external driving and we hinted that such solution
could have been obtained as the slow regular perturba-
tion

xd.eq.(t) = x0(εt)+εx1(εt)+ε2x2(εt)+ε3x3(εt)+O(cid:0)ε4(cid:1) .

(7)
In this letter we expand this point, showing that it’s
possible to iteratively construct the dynamical equilibrium
solution at any order from a regular perturbation theory

based on the ansatz eq.(7) when both the external force Θ
and the reservoir temperature Ω are slow. We than give
a general formula to calculate the heat exchanged by the
system at any desired order of the expansion. This can
be used to characterize thermal cycles and extend them
to situations where drivings are slow but not necessarily
quasi-static. Since such kind of results are quite rare in
the literature, we think that such expansion is a relevant
advance in the ﬁeld of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

II. DERIVATION OF THE DYNAMICAL

EQUILIBRIUM SOLUTION

As stated in the introduction, we suppose that the ex-
ternal force and the reservoir temperatures are slow, i.e.
Θ = Θ(εt), Ω = Ω(εt). Then we solve (1a) for T :

T =

Ω (εt)
Θ (εt)

¨x + 2r 2

πpΩ(εt)ε ˙x + Θ (εt) x

(8)

Following the same procedure we used in [7] we trans-
form the system (1) into a single third order equation.

and substitute in ˙T (1b) to obtain:

(9)

Now, instead of looking for a general approximation of
x(t), we limit ourselves to the dynamical equilibrium so-
lution xd.eq.(t). Following the ansatz eq.(7), we expand
xd.eq.(t) as

xd.eq.(t) =

∞

Xn=0

xn(εt)εn

(10)

and substitute eq.(10) in eq.(9). Upon deﬁning

s = εt,

(11)

isolating ε coeﬃcient and then equating them to zero we
obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for xn(s).
Solving it, we ﬁnd:

Eq.(12e) deﬁnes a recurrence relation where x0(s), x1(s),
x2(s) and x3(s) act as initial conditions. We can there-
fore use eq.(12) and eq.(13) to obtain every term in the
series (10) simply by diﬀerentiation and multiplication.
Furthermore, eq.(12e) is homogeneous and x1 = x3 = 0,
then x2n+1 = 0 for every n ∈ N. It is also worth to note
that if we limit the expansion of eq.(10) to the 0-th term,
we obtain the law of perfect gasses. Higher orders terms
are small corrections arising from the fact that Ω and Θ
are changed in a ﬁnite time.
In this sense eq.(10) and
eq.(12) can be qualitatively considered as an analogue of
the virial expansion for a perfect gas where ﬁnite time-
eﬀects plays the role of inter-particle interaction contri-
butions.

Knowing the terms of the expansion (10) we can ﬁnd

Indeed, substituting t = s/ε into (3b) we ﬁrst ﬁnd:

an analogous expansion for the the heat:

which, upon the substitution of (10) and (8), yields the
following values for the coeﬃcients in (14):

III. DISCUSSION

In this last section we discuss the results we obtained.
In ﬁrst place, we derived an explicit recurrence formula
(12e) to calculate the dynamical equilibrium solution x
(and hence T via (8)) with an arbitrary precision. Only
multiplications and diﬀerentiations are required in such
formula, thus making the evaluation of x and T a trivial
task.
It is worth to note that, being absent the odd
terms, at the N th iteration we will have an error of order

O(cid:0)ε2N +2(cid:1). Obviously the expansion (10) is valid only

within its convergence radius, which can be in principle
determined from the recurrence relation (12e). However
its determination is a complex task which is beyond the
scope of this letter.

In second place we observe that (12e) is valid for gen-
eral instances of Θ and Ω provided, that they (i) depend
on time only trough εt, (ii) they are smooth and (iii)
never vanish. This extends the results of our previous
paper [7] where we were limited to use Ω = 1 and opens
the possibility to study thermodynamic cycles. In turn,
using this regular expansion technique, we lose the char-
acterization of transient phenomena. This is not a high
price, as we are not interested in transient behavior when
concerned with thermodynamic cycles. Moreover numer-
ical evidence lead us to conjecture that, for ε suﬃciently
small, all solutions of (1) falls into our dynamical equilib-
rium solution. One example of such evidence is obtained
as follows: using

Ω(s) = 1 +

sin(s), Θ(s) = 1 +

(17)

we simulate eq.(9) with x(0) = xd.eq.(0) and x(0) =
xd.eq.(0) + Kε, thus obtaining xnum(t) and xnum

spectively. We then study

R =

s∈[7π,9π]|xnum(s) − xd.eq.(s)|

s∈[7π,9π](cid:12)(cid:12)xnum
d.eq.(s) − xd.eq.(s)(cid:12)(cid:12)
max

(18)

as a function of K and ε, where s ∈ [7π, 9π] ensures that
we are way ahead of the time evolution of the system.
As it emerges by Figure 1, R ≈ 1 for various value of N
and ε, so , we reasonably say that xnum(s) is attracted
by eq.(10).

We conclude by saying that the formulas for the heat
transfer given by (14) and (16) allow us to calculate the
heat at any given order, with a little much eﬀort, as
is required only one additional integration over the x2n
functions already available from eq.(12). This is a useful
result since closed form expressions for heat exchanges
are quite rare in the literature. In particular, expressions
like (14) give an extension to the known quasi-static ther-
modynamic framework and originates from a purely me-

4

chanical starting model of the system [5]. As it can be
seen in the example where Θ and Ω are given by eq.(17),
eqs.(10,14) open the possibility to study thermodynamic
cycles where drivings are slow but not necessarily quasi-
static. As a consequence we are able to characterize sit-
uations where eﬃciency is expected to be high while the
power is close to zero. It is not unreasonable to think that
such limitations can be overcome with further studies.
