ABSTRACT

Aims. It is still unknown how magnetic ﬁeld-generation mechanisms could operate in low-mass dwarf galaxies. Here, we present
a detailed study of a nearby pure-disk dwarf galaxy NGC 2976. Unlike previously observed dwarf objects, this galaxy possesses a
clearly deﬁned disk. We also discuss whether NGC 2976 could serve as a potential source of the intergalactic magnetic ﬁeld.
Methods. For the purpose of our studies, we performed deep multi-frequency polarimetric observations of NGC 2976 with the VLA
and Eﬀelsberg radio telescopes. Additionally, we supplement them with re-imaged data from the WSRT-SINGS survey for which
a rotation measure (RM) synthesis was performed. A new weighting scheme for the RM synthesis algorithm, consisting of includ-
ing information about the quality of data in individual frequency channels, was proposed and investigated. Application of this new
weighting to the simulated data, as well as to the observed data, results in an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio in the Faraday
depth space.
Results.The magnetic ﬁeld morphology discovered in NGC 2976 consists of a southern polarized ridge. This structure does not seem
to be due to just a pure large-scale dynamo process (possibly cosmic-ray driven) at work in this object, as indicated by the RM data
and dynamo number calculations. Instead, the ﬁeld of NGC 2976 is modiﬁed by past gravitational interactions and possibly also by
ram pressure inside the M 81 galaxy group environment. The estimates of total (7 µG) and ordered (3 µG) magnetic ﬁeld strengths,
as well as degree of ﬁeld order (0.46), which is similar to those observed in spirals, suggest that tidally generated magnetized gas
ﬂows can further enhance dynamo action in the object. NGC 2976 is apparently a good candidate for the eﬃcient magnetization of its
neighbourhood. It is able to provide an ordered (perhaps also regular) magnetic ﬁeld into the intergalactic space up to a distance of
about 5 kpc.
Conclusions. Tidal interactions (and possibly also ram pressure) can lead to the formation of unusual magnetic ﬁeld morphologies
(like polarized ridges) in galaxies out of the star-forming disks, which do not follow any observed component of the interstellar
medium (ISM), as observed in NGC 2976. These galaxies are able to provide ordered magnetic ﬁelds far out of their main disks.

1. Introduction

In low-mass dwarf galaxies, the conditions and eﬃciency of the
magnetic ﬁeld generation process are still not very well under-
stood (see e.g. Chy˙zy et al. 2011). In these objects, the inﬂu-
ence of magnetic ﬁelds on the interstellar medium is expected
to be even more important, because of their smaller gravita-
tional potential and the possibility of gas escaping via galactic
winds. On the other hand, dwarf galaxies rotate more weakly
with more random motions, providing for a weak ω – eﬀect.
Therefore, there could be no large-scale dynamo at work in some
dwarfs at all, as they are below the dynamo eﬃciency threshold
(Gressel et al. 2008). In these objects, random magnetic ﬁelds
could be produced by a small-scale dynamo action (Zeldovich
et al. 1990).

The knowledge of properties of magnetic ﬁelds in dwarfs is
also crucial for explaining the magnetization of the intergalactic

medium (IGM). Kronberg et al. (1999) suggested in their ‘boil-
ing universe’ concept that low-mass galaxies were likely sources
of primeval ﬁelds. However, Chy˙zy et al. (2011) argued that for
a sample of dwarf galaxies from the Local Group, these objects
seem to be only able to magnetize their immediate neighbour-
hood. A similar conclusion was also drawn by Drzazga et al.
(2011) in their studies of interacting galaxies as potential sources
of the IGM’s magnetic ﬁelds. Thus the question about the origin
of the primeval magnetic ﬁelds and the role of dwarf galaxies in
the magnetization of the Universe remains unanswered.

Only a handful of dwarf galaxies have been observed to date
with respect to magnetic ﬁelds for which the dynamo concepts
could be tested. As expected, in the very small and low-mass
dwarfs IC 10 and NGC 6822 (linear size of 1 and 2 kpc, respec-
tively) no large-scale (regular) magnetic ﬁelds have been de-
tected to date (Chy˙zy et al. 2003, Chy˙zy et al. 2011, Heesen
et al. 2011), which indicates that these objects are below the eﬃ-
ciency threshold of the large-scale dynamo. In the more massive
and larger dwarfs, NGC 4449 as well as in the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC; of 7 and 10 kpc size, respectively), regular mag-
netic ﬁelds (of 8 and 1 µG, respectively) with fragments of some

large-scale spiral structure, as evident signatures of large-scale
α − ω dynamo, were observed (Chy˙zy et al. 2000, Gaensler et al.
2005). Some regular ﬁelds (of about 1 µG) were also found in the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC; of 6 kpc size), but in this case,
the ﬁeld structure did not resemble any large-scale dynamo (Mao
et al. 2008). However, as these three large dwarfs show distinct
signs of strong tidal interactions, it is not clear whether and how
gravitational interactions inﬂuenced the set-up of the large-scale
dynamo process, and which conditions are appropriate for an ef-
ﬁcient dynamo to occur in dwarfs.

To shed new light on the problem of the generation and evo-
lution of magnetic ﬁelds in low-mass galaxies, multi-frequency,
sensitive radio polarimetric observations of a dwarf galaxy
NGC 2976 were performed. This is a dynamically simple, bul-
geless, pure-disk object, with no discernible spiral arms (Simon
et al. 2003) of SAc type (De Vaucouleurs et al. 1991) located
at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. This galaxy seems to be a scaled ver-
sion of the class of larger pure-disk spirals (e.g. Gallagher &
Matthews 2002, Matthews & van Driel 2000). It has an abso-
lute visual luminosity and disk size between those of SMC and
LMC. The unique characteristics of NGC 2976 – its morphology
of a typical spiral galaxy but its linear size and mass correspond-
ing to those of dwarfs – makes it an ideal laboratory to study
magnetic ﬁeld-generation processes in low-mass galaxies. The
total power (TP) radio emission of NGC 2976 was observed at
1.4 GHz with the Very Large Array (VLA) by Condon (1987).
This galaxy was also included in the WSRT-SINGS polarimet-
ric survey (Heald et al. 2009; Braun et al. 2010), within which
deep and high-resolution observations were performed using the
WSRT. However, the relatively small mass and the dwarf-like,
rather than spiral character of NGC 2976 , went unnoticed in pre-
vious studies.

NGC 2976 is a member of the M 81 galaxy group, located
close to its centre. However, unlike the Magellanic Clouds and
NGC 4449, NGC 2976 has probably not been greatly disturbed
for a long time, as it shows very regular U, B, and V isophotes
in the outer disk (Bronkalla et al. 1992), its H i velocity ﬁeld
is undistorted, and its velocity dispersion is small (11 km s−1,
Stil & Israel 2002b). Hence, the conditions for the magnetic
ﬁeld generation process (e.g. galactic dynamics, size, mass, star
formation rate (SFR), etc.) can be constrained for this object
without the strong inﬂuence of gravitational or ram pressure in-
teractions. Such well-established dynamo conditions are of pri-
mary signiﬁcance in building up theoretical concepts of the dy-
namo theory (Brandenburg & Subramanian 2005) as well as in
explaining the magnetic structures that have been observed in
dwarfs.

Studies of magnetic ﬁelds in dwarf galaxies are observation-
ally diﬃcult, as these objects are usually radio-weak (e.g. Chy˙zy
et al. 2011). Hence, we used sensitive instruments: the VLA1
(USA) and 100-meter Eﬀelsberg radio telescope2 (Germany)
to observe NGC 2976 . Additionally, we supplemented our ob-
servations with the spectro-polarimetric data from the WSRT-
SINGS survey (Heald et al. 2009). The detailed account of these
observations and the data reduction are given in Section 2. In
Section 3 the results are presented. Discussion and conclusions
of the results are shown in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.

2. Observations and data reduction

2.1. VLA

NGC 2976 was observed with the VLA in L band in C, DnC, and
D conﬁgurations (Table 2). The total on-source time, as calcu-
lated from the schedule and dynamic times, was about 16 hours.
The observations were performed in full polarization mode us-
ing two 50 MHz width ‘intermediate frequency’ channels cen-
tred at 1385.100 and 1464.900 MHz. The data were reduced with
the AIPS package3, following the standard procedure. The ﬂux
scale and position angle of polarization were calibrated using
the amplitude calibrator (0521+166;3C 138/1331+305;3C286).
The phase calibrator (0841+708) was used to ﬁnd gain, phase,
and polarization leakage solutions. Each of the datasets speci-
ﬁed in Table 2 was calibrated in this way separately, and then
self-calibrated in phase-only. After checking for consistency be-
tween the datasets, they were concatenated and self-calibrated in
phase, as well as in amplitude and phase.

In the ﬁnal stage, imaging with the AIPS task IMAGR was
performed for all the Stokes parameters using Briggs’ robust
weighting of 1 and -5. The obtained Q and U maps were com-
bined within the task COMB to form maps of polarized inten-

sity that were corrected for positive bias (PI = pQ2 + U2) and

polarization angle (PA = 0.5 arctan(U/Q)). The rms sensitivity
(for imaging with robust 1) is 20 µJy/beam for the total power
intensity, and 9 µJy/beam for the polarized intensity (PI).

2.2. Effelsberg

NGC 2976 was observed with the 100-m Eﬀelsberg radio tele-
scope at 4.85 and 8.35 GHz. At 4.85 GHz, a two-horn secondary
focus system with bandwidth of 0.5 GHz was used, recording
data in four channels/horn. Two of these channels recorded
the total power signal, while the others recorded signals in
Stokes Q and U. For the object, 24 coverages (maps) in Az/Alt
frame were obtained. However, only 12 of them were suit-
able for polarization studies (Table 3). At 8.35 GHz, a 1.1 GHz
bandwidth single-horn receiver was used, also recording data
in four channels (see above). In this case, 66 coverages in
the right ascension-declination (RA/Dec) frame were obtained.
Unfortunately, nearly half of the data (Table 3) were unusable,
owing to strong radio frequency interference-like (RFI) spikes
near the target. At both the observation frequencies, corrections
of telescope pointing were made about every 1.5 hours by scan-
ning a nearby strong point radio source.

We performed data reduction in the standard way by apply-
ing the NOD2 package (Haslam 1974). First, all coverages at
both the frequencies were edited to remove any RFI and align
baselines to the common level; then the data at 4.85 GHz from
both horns were averaged using the software beam-switching
technique (Morsi & Reich 1986) and transformed to the RA/Dec
frame (for 8.35 GHz data this step was not necessary, see above).
In the next stage of data reduction, all usable coverages (Table
3) were combined using the spatial frequency weighting method
(Emerson & Gr¨ave 1988). In the ﬁnal stage, all Stokes param-
eter maps at both wavelengths were digitally ﬁltered to remove
Fourier spatial frequencies, which correspond to noisy structures
that are less than the beam sizes and then transformed to the
FITS format. Further processing that included ﬂux scale cali-
bration and the formation of polarized intensity (corrected for
positive bias) and polarization angle maps was performed in the

ibrated using 3C 286, based on the assumption that its ﬂux is
7.47 Jy at 4.85 GHz and 5.27 Jy at 8.35 GHz (as provided in the
VLA Calibrator List4). The obtained rms noise levels are given
in Table 3.

2.3. Re-analysisoftheWSRT-SINGSdata

We also made use of the calibrated WSRT-SINGS polarimetric
uv data in the 18 cm and 22 cm bands (for details see Heald et al.
2009). The data were re-imaged by applying the Miriad software
using the Briggs robust weighting of 1.0. The Q and U frequency
data cubes containing 702 frequency channels obtained in this
way were convolved to the resolution of 48.6” × 45.0”, provid-
ing a high sensitivity to extended radio structures. Then, for the
Q and U data cubes, rotation measure synthesis (RM synthe-
sis; Brentjens & de Bruyn 2005) was performed applying a new
weighting scheme that takes the quality of individual frequency
channels into account (see Appendix A for details).

The resolution in Faraday depth that was obtained for the fre-
quency coverage of the WSRT-SINGS survey is about 144 rad
m−2, whereas the sensitivity to extended structures in Faraday
space (at which 50% of polarized ﬂux can be recovered) is about
110 rad m−2. The maximum Faraday depth that could be sam-
pled in the Faraday domain is about 1.7 × 105 rad m−2. We
did not expect polarized emission at such high depths so, the
Faraday domain was sampled within a range of -500 to +500 rad
m−2 every 2.5 rad m−2. As the RMTF (rotation measure trans-
fer function) shows a high level of side-lobes (of about 80%,
see Sect. A.4) owing to the gap in frequency coverage between
18 cm and 22 cm data bands, the RM-CLEAN deconvolution
method (Heald et al. 2009) was used. With this algorithm, the
Q(φ) and U(φ) cubes were cleaned down to the 1-sigma noise
level and then restored with a Gaussian beam of the same width
as the main RMTF lobe. After cleaning Q and U data cubes,
we calculated the polarized intensity map for the studied object
(not corrected for the positive bias as negligible in this case).
This map was obtained as a maximum of PI signal over all sam-
pled Faraday depths for each line of sight. We also computed

4 https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/observing/callist

B-vectors, maximum Faraday depth (for the maximum of PI sig-
nal), and magnetic ﬁeld vector distribution maps. The B-vectors
map was calculated for the eﬀective frequency of about 1.5 GHz
to which all polarization vectors were de-rotated. This approach
is applied because, for the given resolution in Faraday domain
and signal-to-noise ratio of at least 4, the maximum Faraday
depth error is large, about 18 rad m−2, which prevents us from
directly obtaining reliable information about intrinsic directions
of magnetic ﬁeld vectors (see Brentjens & de Bruyn 2005).

3. Results

3.1. 1.43GHz

Our sensitive polarimetric VLA observation of NGC 2976 re-
sults in a detection of some very extended radio emission sur-
rounding the object (Fig. 1). This radio extent of the galaxy
was not known earlier, as previously only a total power emis-
sion closely related to its optical disk was obtained (Condon
1987; Niklas 1995; Stil & Israel 2002a; Heald et al. 2009). In
the low-resolution total power map (Fig. 1), the brightest emis-
sion coincides with the sharpened disk (i.e. a disk possessing
sharp truncation edge; Williams et al. 2010) of the NGC 2976,
and the maximum is well correlated with two bright H ii regions
located at the edges of the object. This is even more visible in
the high-resolution (of about 0.26 kpc) map (Fig. 2) superim-
posed on the 24 µm infrared image from Spitzer (Kennicutt et al.
2003). There is a good correspondence between the images in
both wavelengths.

Beside the stellar disk, the total power radio emission (in
the lower resolution map, Fig. 1) extends in the north-eastern
direction, where a low-brightness signal of about 60 µJy/beam
(3 × rms noise level) resides. Radio emission at a similar level
is also observed in the southern part of the galaxy. However,
here its extension is smaller and brighter than in the opposite
direction. The total power radiation of NGC 2976 corresponds
well to its H i distribution (Fig. 1) in the NE and SW directions.
However, radio emission does not follow the outer SE extension
and the spur of H i in the north (see also Chynoweth et al. 2008).
The distribution of polarized intensity in NGC 2976 (Fig. 3)
is even more surprising than the total power one. Most of the

observed polarized emission (more than 60%) comes from the
south-western part of the object, where the polarization degree
reaches 50%. We note that this number does not take into ac-
count the regions within the object close to the total power in-
tensity at the level of 3×rms, where the polarization degree has
unphysical values as high as 100%. This is due to the higher
sensitivity of the polarized intensity map, which is not bounded
by the confusion limit. The brightest southern PI region was
also detected by Heald et al. (2009) in their high-resolution
WSRT-SINGS survey (see also Sect. 3.5). The polarized signal
is weaker in the disk, and appears only in its southern part. In
the northern part of NGC 2976, the distribution of polarized sig-
nal forms a curved arc structure. A convolution of the Q and U
Stokes parameters maps to the lower resolution of 45” and then
computing the PI map that resulted from them (Fig. 4) enabled
us to also detect a polarized extension in the southern part of the

object. Southern and south-eastern extensions coincids with the
H i tail and the northern tip of PI corresponds to the northern H i
spur, which is visible in Fig. 1.

Comparison of the polarized intensity map of NGC 2976
with its Hα emission (Fig. 3) reveals that the PI distribution
of the object is quite unusual compared to the other low-mass
galaxies for which polarimetric observations were performed.
Typically for dwarfs, the polarized signal is closely related to
the regions where massive stars are formed. These ﬁndings were
made in NGC 4449, where the emission follows a part of the
massive arm that is actively forming stars (Chy˙zy et al. 2000);
IC10, in which only a polarized intensity near the giant H ii re-
gions was detected (Chy˙zy et al. 2003; Heesen et al. 2011);
NGC 1569, where multi-wavelength radio observations reveal PI
features that are associated with Hα bubbles – outside the stel-
lar disk (Kepley et al. 2010). However, in NGC 2976 the polar-
ized emission mostly resides very far from H ii regions. This is
likely due to external agents (tidal interactions and perhaps ram
pressure, see Sect. 4.5) and is, to some degree, also due to the

Faraday depolarization. Faint Hα emission extends only to the
west from the northern H ii region and to the east from the cen-
tral part of the system. Even trying to increase the signal-to-noise
ratio in the Hα map by convolving it to the resolution of radio
data does not reveal any extended emission5. This is in agree-
ment with Thilker et al. (2007), where the galaxy was classiﬁed
as not having an extended UV disk. While NGC 2976 shares a
high level of optical symmetry with M 33, which also has a thin
disk and a rotation that is only twice as fast (Tabatabaei et al.
2008), the polarized emission of NGC 2976 is much more asym-
metric.

Based on the WSRT-SINGS survey, Heald et al. (2009)
found that, in normal galaxies, their receding side is signiﬁcantly
depolarized at long wavelengths (of about 20 cm), owing to a ge-
ometry of large-scale magnetic ﬁelds and the longer way the po-
larized waves travel through the magneto-ionic medium. From
the H i velocity ﬁeld observations of NGC 2976 (publicly avail-
able within the THINGS survey, Walter et al. 2008) we found
that the north-western part of the object has a receding major
axis. This implies that this side of the galaxy should exhibit a
less polarized emission, compared to the opposite side. This ef-
fect is actually observed for the optical disk.

5 The same is true for the map in far-UV, which is also a tracer of star

formation.

on the DSS blue image. The contour levels are (3, 5, 8, 16, 24)
× 13 (rms noise level) µJy/beam. The vector of 10” length cor-
responds to the polarized intensity of about 42 µJy/beam.

The total power ﬂux density measured at 1.43 GHz for
NGC 2976 is 65.7 ± 2.8 mJy, while the polarized intensity ﬂux
density is 7.8 ± 0.8 mJy, which gives a total polarization degree
of 12 ± 2%. Such values are typically observed in more massive
spiral galaxies but at higher radio frequencies (e.g. Beck et al.
1996).

3.2. 4.85and8.35GHz

In Figure 5, the total power emission at 4.85 GHz from the
Eﬀelsberg telescope is presented (see also Jurusik et al. 2014).
Its resolution is much lower (152”) than in the VLA observa-
tions. In this map, similarly to the high-resolution data, the TP
signal has a maximum shifted to the northern part of the galaxy’s
disk, where one of the giant H ii regions is located. The low-level
emission of 1.35 - 2.25 mJy/beam is elongated in the NE direc-
tion (possibly it is not real). There is no such elongation to SE. A
similar asymmetry was observed in the 1.43 GHz data (Fig. 1).
The elongation in the NW direction seems to be correlated with
a source that is also visible at 1.43 GHz. The total power ﬂux
density of NGC 2976 measured at 4.85 GHz is 30.0 ± 1.4 mJy
(Table 3), which is in excellent agreement with the radio ﬂux
that is determined at the same frequency by Gregory & Condon
(1991).

The morphology of polarized intensity at 4.85 GHz (Fig. 5)
closely resembles that at 1.43 GHz. Here almost all (about 80%)
of the polarized ﬂux density, which is 1.6 ± 0.4 mJy (giving a po-
larization degree of about 5%, Table 3), comes from the southern
part of the disk and the southern extension. Only some small po-
larized blobs have been detected in northern direction. The nar-

row emission from the disk is located close to the galaxy centre,
while at 1.43 GHz it is barely shifted towards the south.

The noticeable diﬀerence in the polarized emission between
4.85 GHz and 1.43 GHz is related to the orientation of the B-
vectors. At 4.85 GHz, the vectors are nearly perpendicular to
those observed at the lower frequency. As the Faraday eﬀects
are smaller at shorter wavelengths, we can expect that the direc-
tions of B-vectors, which are observed at 4.85 GHz, are close to
the intrinsic directions of magnetic ﬁeld vectors (see Fig. 13).

The total power emission of NGC 2976 at 8.35 GHz is pre-
sented in Fig. 6. This is closely related to the optical disk. There
is no radio emission extension to the NE direction seen at lower
frequencies, as expected for steep-spectrum radiation (see Sect.
3.3). The total power ﬂux density measured for this frequency is
19.3 ± 0.9 mJy (Table 3). In the polarization, we did not detect
the galaxy. Probably weak weather artefacts or radio interference
close to the noise level of the polarized intensity map prevented
detection.

3.3. Spectralindexdistribution

The map of spectral index distribution shown in Figure 7
was computed for NGC 2976 using the maps at 1.43 GHz and
4.85 GHz, after convolving them to a common resolution. The
input maps were cut at 3 × rms noise level. The uncertainty of
the obtained values is less than 0.4. Despite the low resolution
of the map, one of the large H ii regions in the northern part of
the disk, where the spectral index reaches a level as high as -0.4,
-0.5, is visible. In the rest of the disk, the spectral index of about
-0.6, -0.7 is observed. These values are normally encountered in
the spiral arms of galaxies (see, e.g. Chy˙zy et al. 2007b). This
could mean that the emission from the optical disk is dominated
by the radiation of young relativistic electrons that are spiralling

in a magnetic ﬁeld with some small contribution from thermal
emission (see Sect. 4.1). Outside the disk, the spectrum steep-
ens sharply, reaching values of about -0.9, apparently owing to
the aging of relativistic particles there. By way of an example, a
similar eﬀect was found for NGC 1569 (Kepley et al. 2010).

larized intensity map at 4.85 GHz, the levels are: (3, 5, 8) × 80
(rms noise level) µJy/beam. The map resolution is 152”.

3.4. Distributionofrotationmeasure

In Fig. 8, the distribution of rotation measure (with uncertainty
less than 6 rad m−2) is shown. It was calculated in a ‘classic’ way
on a pixel-by-pixel basis for the signal-to-noise ratio that was
greater than 3, using the polarization angle maps available at two
frequencies of 1.43 and 4.85 GHz. We note from this map that
the rotation measure observed for NGC 2976 is mostly negative.
The values of RM change smoothly from the north to the south-
western direction. In the northern part of the object, RM has a
value of about -35 rad m−2. In moving to the south, the rotation
measure grows from -30 to -23 rad m−2, taking a value of about
-13 rad m−2 in the galaxy’s SE part.

When analysing the data on the rotation measure, the contri-
bution from the Milky Way should be taken into account. One
of the most standard ways to determine this contribution con-
sists of using some nearby polarized background sources. In the
case of NGC 2976, a suitable source is located at RA (J2000.0):
09h48m35s, Dec(J2000.0): 67o53′10”. Assuming that its inter-
nal RM is negligible, the foreground rotation measure for this
source is about -35 rad m−2. This is in excellent agreement with
the foreground rotation measure in the direction of NGC 2976
that is reported by Heald et al. (2009), based on their WSRT-
SINGS data. This foreground RM also agrees with the all-sky
map published by Johnston-Hollitt et al. (2004).

Thus, taking into account the Milky Way rotation measure,
it seems the magnetic ﬁeld directed towards the observer can
actually be seen within NGC 2976. After correcting for the fore-
ground RM, it ranges from zero in the north to +22 rad m−2
in the south-east. These values are almost an order of magni-
tude lower than the rotation measures typically observed in nor-
mal galaxies at high frequencies (of about ± 100 rad m−2, Beck
& Wielebinski 2013) and some dwarf galaxies, e.g. NGC 4449

(Chy˙zy et al. 2000) and NGC 1569 (Kepley et al. 2010). The
rather low value of rotation measure found in NGC 2976 could
imply that the regular magnetic ﬁelds are weak in the object.
Other possible explanations are that there is a low content of
thermal electrons (which also aﬀect the rotation measure) in the
regions from which polarized intensity comes, or that the mag-
netic ﬁeld in NGC 2976 is aligned mainly in the sky plane.

3.5. RMSynthesis

For NGC 2976, spectro-polarimetric observations with the
WSRT were also performed and analysed using the RM syn-
thesis method (Heald et al. 2009) but with high spatial resolu-
tion and low sensitivity to extended radio structures. After re-
imaging these data (see Sect. 2.3 for details), it was possible to
discover polarized intensity structures (Fig. 9), which had not
been seen previously by Heald et al. (2009). A comparison of
the new WSRT-SINGS and VLA (see Fig. 4) polarized intensity
images reveals that the distributions of PI in both the datasets are
in very close agreement. As in the VLA, a characteristic southern
bright PI region and an extension to the north are also visible in
the WSRT image. Furthermore, these data conﬁrm the existence
of the polarized emission in the SE direction, which was seen
after a convolution of the VLA image to the lower resolution of
45”. Compared to the PI emission, the orientations of B-vectors
also agree well between both the observations6.

Scanning through the RM cube along the Faraday depth re-
veals that the polarized emission coming from NGC 2976 is
mostly point-like in this domain. This is in agreement with the
ﬁndings of Heald et al. (2009). In Fig. 10, the slice from the cube

6 The central frequencies between the datasets diﬀer slightly; for
WSRT, it is about 1.5 GHz, while for VLA, it is 1.43 GHz, so the B-
vectors orientations are actually slightly diﬀerent.

µJy/beam. The vector of 10” length corresponds to the polarized
intensity of about 31.3 µJy/beam. The map resolution is 48.6” ×
45.0” HPBW.

at the depth of -25 rad m−2 is shown, where most of detected po-
larized signal can be seen.

Taking into account that there is only one point-like Faraday
component in the cube, it was possible to construct a maximum
Faraday depth map for the object (Fig. 11, Sect. 2.3). The dis-
tribution of Faraday depths, as shown in the image , was cut
oﬀ at the 3 × rms (of 25 µJy/beam) noise level of the PI map.
We note that, according to Brentjens & de Bruyn (2005), a total
signal-to-noise ratio greater than 4 is needed to determine reli-
able information about Faraday depth using the RM Synthesis
method. This limit is indicated in the image by the ﬁrst PI con-
tour. A comparison of the high resolution (48.6” × 45”) max-
imum Faraday depth map that was obtained by applying the
RM synthesis technique to the low resolution RM map (Fig. 8)
obtained by the ‘classical method’ shows that they are similar.
Particularly noticeable are the negative Faraday depths found in
the strongly polarized SW region (this region shows a Faraday
depth of about -25 rad m−2). In the northern, south-eastern, and
western parts of the galaxy, where the signal-to-noise ratio is
lower, the maximum Faraday depth distribution is more chaotic.
The similarity of both the maximum Faraday depth and RM
maps indicates that Faraday depolarization is relatively small –
around 1 GHz in NGC 2976.

4. Discussion
4.1. Thermalfraction

The radio emission of normal galaxies has thermal and non-
thermal components. To be able to estimate the magnetic ﬁeld

strength, which is directly related to the non-thermal radio emis-
sion, both these components must ﬁrst be properly separated.
The best method to separate them consists of ﬁtting a simple
model of a thin optical disk to the multifrequency radio data
(Niklas et al. 1997). The model is described by the following
equation:

ν0!−0.1

ν0!αnth

,

(1)

+ (1 − fth(ν0))  ν

  S ν
S ν0! = fth(ν0)  ν
where S ν and S ν0 are radio ﬂuxes for a given frequency and the
frequency for which the separation is performed. Here, fth(ν0) is
the so-called thermal fraction, being a ratio of thermal and total
radio ﬂuxes, and αnth is the non-thermal spectral index. For the
thermal emission, a spectral index of -0.1 is assumed. In the case
of NGC 2976, it was possible to use this method taking ﬂux val-
ues from our observations at three frequencies. Moreover, as it
was pointed out in Sect. 3, this galaxy was also observed in the
2.8 cm survey of Shapley-Ames galaxies (Niklas et al. 1995).
Thus, four measurement points (Fig. 12) are available, which is
a minimum that enables us to ﬁt the above model and get the de-
sired thermal fraction and non-thermal spectral index. The ther-
mal fraction obtained in this way fth is 0.16 +/- 0.12 at 1.43 GHz,
while αnth is -0.82 +/- 0.20. However, we note that the highest
frequency data point in the spectrum (from Niklas et al.) seems
to be shifted upwards from the ﬁt and should be regarded with
caution.

An alternative method of separation of thermal and non-
thermal emission consists of estimating the thermal radio ﬂux
using star formation tracers, for instance, Hα emission (see, e.g.
Niklas et al. 1997; Chy˙zy et al. 2007a). It should be stressed,
however, that Hα is aﬀected by internal extinction, which is usu-
ally barely known about (if at all), and which makes this method
less eﬀective. The extinction uncertainty is more problematic
for large well-evolved spiral galaxies than for low-metallicity
dwarfs. According to the recent studies, it is possible to estimate
this eﬀect by also taking into account data on infrared emission
(Calzetti et al. 2007; Kennicutt & Evans 2012). By inserting the
Hα and infrared emission into the classical formula of the ther-
mal ﬂux estimation (Niklas et al. 1997), we obtained the radio
thermal ﬂux at frequency ν (see also, Jurusik et al. 2014):

where S Hα and νIRS IR are Hα and IR (multiplied by the IR fre-
quency) ﬂuxes, respectively. For NGC 2976, the Hα ﬂux was
taken from Kennicutt et al. (2008), while the IR 24 µ ﬂux was
taken from the Spitzer satellite observations (Dale et al. 2009).
Here, Te was assumed to be 104 K. The thermal fraction obtained
in this way is 0.17 ± 0.02 at 1.43 GHz, which is in excellent
agreement with the results of the ﬁtting method.

This is quite unexpected, since these thermal fractions and
non-thermal spectral indices are typically observed for normal
spiral galaxies that are much more massive than NGC 2976.
Niklas et al. (1997) determined the mean fth of 0.08 ± 0.01 (at
1 GHz) and an average αnth of -0.83 ± 0.02 for a sample of 74
galaxies of various morphological type. For the dwarfs, much
higher thermal fractions were found; Chy˙zy et al. (2003) esti-
mated that for IC 10 fth reaches a level of 0.6 (see also, Heesen
et al. 2011) and for NGC 6822, it is even as high as 0.8-0.9 at
10.45 GHz (the thermal fraction of NGC 2976 at this frequency
would only be about 0.45). Even higher fth were obtained for
three late-type galaxies that are characterized by low star for-
mation activity and explained by their weak magnetic ﬁelds and
nonlinear dependency between nonthermal emission and SFR
(Chy˙zy et al. 2007a).

In the same way as the thermal fraction, the global spectral
index of NGC 2976 (-0.67 ± 0.03) also follows the value of -0.74
± 0.12 found for a sample of normal galaxies (Gioia et al. 1982).

4.2. Magneticﬁeldstrength

After separating the thermal and non-thermal emissions, it was
possible to estimate the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld in the in-
vestigated object. The formulas given by Beck & Krause (2005)
were used for this purpose, with the assumption of an energy-
density equipartition between the total ﬁeld and cosmic rays
(CR). A typical disk thickness (corrected for the projection ef-
fects) of 1 kpc and the proton-to-electron ratio of 100 were as-
sumed in the calculations (using the non-thermal spectral index
of 0.83 from Niklas et al. 1997). The mean non-thermal surface
brightness was measured in the area that was determined by the
requirement of radio emission being at a level of at least 3σ noise
level at 1.43 GHz (see Sect. 3), giving the total magnetic ﬁeld
strength Btot of 6.6 ± 1.8 µG.

The total magnetic ﬁeld strength obtained is higher than the
mean value of < 4.2 ± 1.8 µG found for a sample of Local Group
dwarfs (Chy˙zy et al. 2011), but lower than the average value of 9
± 2 µG that was estimated for a sample of 74 galaxies of various
morphological types (Niklas 1995). However, we note that the
Niklas sample also included interacting objects, which are usu-
ally characterized by higher magnetic ﬁelds strengths than those
in normal galaxies (Drzazga et al. 2011). In spiral galaxies with
moderate star formation activity, e.g. in M 31 and M 33, and so
more similar in this sense to NGC 2976 (for which SFR ≈ 0.12
M⊙/yr, see Table 1), the ﬁeld strengths of only about 6 µG were
found (Beck & Wielebinski 2013).

Another important parameter to describe galactic magnetic
ﬁeld properties is the degree of ﬁeld order, deﬁned as a ratio
of the ordered (Bord) and random (Bran) magnetic ﬁeld compo-
nents. This is a useful measure of the net production of the or-

10

R.T. Drzazga et al.: Seeking large-scale magnetic ﬁelds in a pure-disk dwarf galaxy NGC 2976

dered ﬁeld. The Bord estimated from the data about polarized
ﬂux (using formulas of Beck & Krause 2005) for NGC 2976 is
2.8 ± 0.8 µG. This is a typical value for the spirals, in which
ordered ﬁelds in the range of 1 – 5 µG are observed (Beck
& Wielebinski 2013). Along with the random ﬁeld compo-
nent (which for NGC 2976 is Bran = 6.0 ± 1.6 µG), this gives
a very high value of degree of ﬁeld order of 0.46 ± 0.17.
Consequently, with respect to the strength of magnetic ﬁeld
components, NGC 2976 resembles well-deﬁned spiral galaxies
rather than dwarfs.

4.3. Generationofmagneticﬁeld

As was shown in Section 3, non-zero rotation measures were
found for NGC 2976, which possibly suggest that this object
hosts a large-scale partially regular magnetic ﬁeld. One of the
mechanisms to explain the generation of this ﬁeld is a large-scale
magnetohydrodynamic dynamo (e.g. Widrow 2002). To investi-
gate if this process is at work in this galaxy, we can estimate
its eﬃciency, usually described by a dynamo number (Shukurov
2007)

D ≈ 9

where, h0 is the vertical-scale height of the galactic disk, u0 is
the velocity of turbulent motions, s is the radial distance from
is
the centre of the galaxy, ω is the angular velocity and s ∂ω
∂s
the shear rate. To estimate this number for NGC 2976, we as-
sumed a scale height of 0.5 kpc, typical for dwarf galaxies (e.g.
Chy˙zy et al. 2011) and u0 from H i observations of 11 km s−1
(Stil & Israel 2002b). The dynamo number was computed for a
radius of 2.0 kpc, within which the rotation curve can be approx-
imated as ﬂat (as it was suggested by Stil & Israel 2002b, but
questioned by de Blok et al. 2008). At this distance, the rotation
velocity reaches a value of about 71 km s−1 (Stil & Israel 2002b).
Although it rotates with a velocity that is somewhat slower than
that of typical spirals it is still faster than the low-mass galaxies,
NGC 4449 and the SMC (50 and 60 km s−1, respectively). As
the rotation of the disk in NGC 2976 is also more regular than
in SMC and NGC 4449, it can be expected that the large-scale
dynamo process can operate in this object.

Indeed, an estimation for NGC 2976 of a shear rate of about
36 km s−1 kpc−1 and the absolute value of the dynamo number
of about 23 shows that this is comparable to the dynamo number
that was obtained for the Milky Way (of about 20) at the dis-
tance of the Sun (Shukurov 2007). It exceeds the critical limit
|Dcritical|∼ 8 − 10, below which the large-scale dynamo is inef-
ﬁcient (Shukurov 2007). This value does not seem to be typical
for dwarf galaxies, for which mostly subcritical dynamo num-
bers have been obtained (Chy˙zy et al. 2011; Mao et al. 2008).
Even for the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is much larger and
more massive than NGC 2976, Mao et al. (2012) estimated |D|
as ∼10 only. Thus, with the linear size of about 6 kpc and H i
mass of 1.5x108 M⊙ (Stil & Israel 2002a, Table 1), NGC 2976 is
several times less massive than SMC and NGC 4449 and could
set the lowest mass threshold for a large-scale dynamo to work.
Based on simple estimates for the turbulence transport coef-
ﬁcients, it has often been argued for a too long growth time of
the α − ω dynamo (see e.g. Shukurov 2007). But direct simula-
tions of the turbulent ISM by Gressel et al. (2008) led to growth
times of approximately 200 Myr for an α − ω dynamo process. A
similar growth time is found by Hanasz et al. (2004) with cosmic
ray-driven steering of the ISM. In this type of dynamo process,

supernova explosions produce cosmic rays, the pressure from
which leads to the increased eﬃciency of the α eﬀect, which is
responsible for generating the poloidal component of magnetic
ﬁeld. It has recently been successfully applied in simulations of
magnetic ﬁelds in spiral (Hanasz et al. 2009) and barred galaxies
(Kulpa-Dybeł et al. 2011), yielding dynamo growth timescales
of 270 Myr and 300 Myr, respectively. The CR dynamo is also
considered to be a particularly attractive mechanism for dwarfs,
and is able to account for their regular magnetic ﬁelds (Gaensler
et al. 2005; Kepley et al. 2010, Mao et al. 2012). This expla-
nation is further supported by recent global numerical simula-
tions of dwarfs performed by Siejkowski (2012), who ﬁnd that
the magnetic ﬁeld can be ampliﬁed in low-mass objects only if
their rotational velocity exceeds 40 km s−1, However, a velocity
of at least 60 km s−1 is needed for the eﬃcient generation of a
magnetic ﬁeld, and for such fast rotators, their dynamo action
depends mainly on rotational velocity.

By confronting the maximum rotational velocity of
NGC 2976 with these results, we can see that the cosmic-ray
driven dynamo is actually able to operate eﬃciently in this ob-
ject with e-folding ampliﬁcation time not greater than 400 Myr
(cf. Siejkowski’s models with vrot ≥ 60 km s−1). Furthermore,
the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld in NGC 2976 (Sect. 4.2) is
roughly in agreement with the simulations, where for the fast
rotating models this is at the level of a few µG.

4.4. MagneticﬁeldmorphologyofNGC2976

Apart from the ﬁeld strength, its morphology is also crucial
when discussing the large-scale dynamo process. In Fig. 13, a
distribution of magnetic ﬁeld orientations (B-vectors corrected

for Faraday rotation) is presented for NGC 2976. The map was
computed only for the regions where signal-to-noise ratio was
high enough (see Brentjens & de Bruyn 2005). The most sur-
prising are the almost azimuthal (pitch angle around zero de-
grees) directions of the ﬁeld in the southern part of the object,
where the maximum of polarized intensity is observed. Hence,
we suspect that the magnetic ﬁeld in NGC 2976 could not have
been generated by the galactic-scale dynamo action alone, since
a spiral morphology of magnetic ﬁelds would have arisen as a
result. So far, this kind of ﬁeld has been observed most clearly
in the ring galaxy NGC 4736 (Chy˙zy & Buta 2008), which does
not exhibit any strong density waves, like NGC 2976. The nearly
azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld in the south, along with the enhanced
polarized intensity and no corresponding enhancement of total
power emission (cf. Fig. 1 and Fig. 3) imply a ﬁeld compression
in this part of the galaxy. The degree of ﬁeld order of 114 ± 48 %
that is estimated for this area is very high, since it is 2.5 times
higher than the average value (Sect. 4.2).

4.5. Tidalinteractionsorrampressure?

Ram pressure caused by the intra-group medium of the M 81
galaxy group is one possibility of accounting for the magnetic
ﬁeld structure of NGC 2976. This mechanism is most often ob-
served in clusters of galaxies, e.g. in the Virgo cluster (see, e.g.
Vollmer et al. 2013). In galaxy groups, the relative speed of ob-
jects with respect to the surrounding medium and its density (the
quantities that the ram pressure depends on) are usually one or-
der of magnitude lower than for the clusters. Recently, Bureau
& Carignan (2002) have considered the inﬂuence of ram pres-
sure on the galaxy HoII, which is located about 0.5 Mpc from
the core of the M 81 group. They argue that, for this low-mass
object, the density of the ambient medium of the M 81 group
and its relative velocity are high enough to cause its gas strip-
ping. Thus, Bureau & Carignan’s argument is all the more valid
for NGC 2976, the distance of which to the group centre is lower
(and was supposedly even more so, in the past). The ram pres-
sure aﬀects only the gaseous component (hence the magnetic
ﬁeld frozen into the plasma), leaving the stellar disk untouched.
In the polarized emission, a compressed ﬁeld is usually observed
at the windward side, forming a polarized ridge and a diﬀuse ex-
tension in the opposite side of galactic disk (see, e.g. Vollmer
et al. 2010, Vollmer et al. 2013). This kind of eﬀect could ex-
plain the case of NGC 2976 since, in fact, the structure of its
magnetic ﬁeld closely resembles those observed in some Virgo
cluster spirals, particularly in NGC 4501 (Vollmer et al. 2008),
which has a similar inclination to the galaxy in question.

However, for the ram pressure, a more narrow shock front
is to be expected and not a wide one, as observed in the inves-
tigated object. Compared to NGC 4501, the polarized emission
in NGC 2976 is extended farther beyond the optical disc. Also,
no index ﬂattening is seen in NGC 2976 (Sect. 3.3) in the re-
gion of maximum polarized emission, which is expected for the
strong ram pressure (see Vollmer et al. 2013). Moreover, recent
studies of nearby low-mass galaxies show that NGC 2976 ﬁts
into the general trend of radio-infrared correlation that is deter-
mined for more massive spirals (Jurusik et al. 2014). For Virgo
cluster galaxies that exhibit ram pressure stripping, deviations
from the correlation were observed (Murphy et al. 2009; Vollmer
et al. 2013), which can be accounted for by an enhanced radio
emission owing to gas compression. Thus, again, in the case
of NGC 2976, the ram pressure eﬀects, if any, must be weak.
Also the morphology of neutral hydrogen in the southern part of
NGC 2976, while being coincident with the PI maximum, it is

tion degree of 12.5%. The polarized intensity map resolution is

not so clearly deﬁned as in the other galaxies that are known to
have been stripped, e.g. in the Virgo spirals, NGC 4501 (Vollmer
et al. 2008) and NGC 4654 (Soida et al. 2006). Even the gas
compression in HoII (Bureau & Carignan 2002) seems to be
more pronounced than in NGC 2976. Taking the present loca-
tion of NGC 2976 into account with respect to the group core,
it is quite plausible that this object has already passed the peak
of ram pressure. In fact, Otmianowska-Mazur & Vollmer (2003)
deﬁne two phases that are related to ram pressure, i.e. a com-
pression phase and a phase of re-accretion, when gas falls back
onto the galactic disk in a spiral-like manner. In their simula-
tions, in the early stages of gas re-accretion the polarized inten-
sity is also enhanced. Moreover, maxima of the gas distribution
outside of the disk should occur in this phase, which is actually
observed in the case of NGC 2976. Another possibility, related
to the ram pressure, is the inﬂuence of draping ﬂows which mod-
ify the large-scale dynamo action and lead to an asymmetric PI
distribution (Moss et al. 2012). However, in this case, relatively
strong ram pressure is also needed.

These potential diﬃculties with the ram pressure scenario
suggest that, in NGC 2976, tidal interaction could play a ma-
jor role. It is thought that the galaxy could have been inﬂu-
enced by M 81 in the past, during its passage close to the
group centre. At present, NGC 2976 is located south-west of
the M 81 group’s core. This kind of interaction, between M 81
and NGC 2976, could have occurred more than 1.3 Gyr ago, as
has been approximately estimated by Williams et al. (2010). In
the high-sensitivity maps of distribution of neutral hydrogen, a

long strip of H i that connects the object with the group centre,
was detected (Chynoweth et al. 2008). Hence, some tidal inter-
actions actually could have taken place (Appleton et al. 1981,
Appleton & van der Hulst 1988, Chynoweth et al. 2008). The
tidal origin of the magnetic ﬁeld morphology, which is observed
in NGC 2976, explains its asymmetric PI distribution, seen at
1.43 GHz and 4.85 GHz and the location of the polarized emis-
sion beyond the optical disk and well within the H i distribution
(Fig. 14). The galaxy also seems not to have a strong ordered
magnetic ﬁeld in its disk. Altogether, these observables have
been recognized by Vollmer et al. (2013) as signatures of tidal
interactions in the Virgo cluster spirals.

Usually, the degree of ﬁeld order is regarded as an indicator
of tidal interactions, since it is statistically lower for the inter-
acting objects than for the non-interacting ones (Drzazga et al.
2011). This is not the case for NGC 2976, for which the degree
of ﬁeld order mentioned above (Sect. 4.2) has a value that is
typically found in non-interacting galaxies. This is not too sur-
prising, since obviously interacting galaxies are known about,
e.g. NGC 4254, for which the degree of ﬁeld order is similar to
those observed in normal objects (Chy˙zy 2008).

However, there are also some problems with attributing the
unusual structure of the magnetic ﬁeld of NGC 2976 to tidal
forces. One of them is its ideally symmetric stellar disk and halo,
which can be an apparent indication that the galaxy has not been
disturbed for a long time (Bronkalla et al. 1992). This makes
the tidal interactions scenario more doubtful, but not impossi-
ble, since magnetic structures can involve quite a long ‘mem-
ory’ of past events (from even 1 Gyr, see Soida et al. 2002 and
ref. therein). This memory is longer when compared to the other
components of the ISM and the stars. The best example of a mis-
match between the structure of the stellar disk and the structure
of the ﬁeld was so far found in the ﬂocculent galaxy, NGC 4414
(Soida et al. 2002). In this high-mass and non-interacting object,
as in NGC 2976, a symmetric ﬂocculent disk can be seen, sug-
gesting that it has not been strongly aﬀected recently. However,
the magnetic ﬁeld contradicts this altogether, since it shows a
complicated morphology as well as a strong RM jump in the
southern part of the object, which is not expected in a non-
disturbed galaxies (Soida et al. 2002). Indeed, recent studies of
de Blok et al. (2014) indicate that NGC 4414 could have taken
part in a minor interaction with low mass galaxy in the past.

From the discussion presented above, we can propose the
following scenario, which reasonably explains the structure of
the magnetic ﬁeld in NGC 2976. More than 1 Gyr ago, the galaxy
took part in gravitational interactions between galaxies in the
group centre. At this time, tidally induced radial inﬂow of gas
occurred, leading to the outside-in truncation of star formation,
speciﬁcally for NGC 2976 (Williams et al. 2010). As shearing
motions and compression are both associated with gas inﬂow,
hence like ram pressure, they are able to produce an ordered or
anisotropic magnetic ﬁeld from its random component, while not
disturbing the stellar disk. These external inﬂuences were proba-
bly relatively weak, and thus could have had more impact on the
least dense ISM phases. The currently observed anomalies in the
magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration of the object would be a result of the
‘memory’ of these past interaction events.

Williams et al. (2010) also consider that the ram pressure
eﬀect causing the stripping of halo gas as an alternative (or ad-
ditional process), which is able to explain the star formation his-
tory of NGC 2976. From our studies presented above, it seems
that this scenario is less likely than the gas redistribution ow-
ing to tidal interactions. However, we cannot exclude that ram
pressure in its late phase of H i gas and magnetized plasma re-

accretion could also have played some part in shaping the mag-
netic ﬁeld in this object.

Detailed 3D numerical MHD simulations are required to
evaluate this scenario. NGC 2976 is a quite suitable object for
this type of simulation, since it does not exhibit any strong
density waves to inﬂuence the structure of its magnetic ﬁeld.
Moreover, from the observational point of view, sensitive X-ray
data are needed to detect the hot gas halo around this object.
This kind of halo, if any, could have a signiﬁcant impact on the
eﬀectiveness of the ram pressure process in NGC 2976.

4.6. PurediskdwarfgalaxiesasapotentialsourcesofIGM

magneticﬁelds

The magnetization of intergalactic space is still an open prob-
lem in modern astrophysics (see Sect. 1). As it was shown in
Sect. 3, NGC 2976 exhibits a strong TP radio emission, extend-
ing up to 4.5 kpc (without correction for the inclination angle),
thus in a general agreement with Chy˙zy et al. (2011) predictions
that are based on the assumption that the star formation was con-
tinuous in galaxies, which is the case for NGC 2976 (Williams
et al. 2010). While it is not suﬃcient to regard NGC 2976 as an
eﬀective provider of magnetic ﬁeld into the IGM, it is worth-
while noting that this galaxy shows also an extended polarized
emission of a similar extension as the total power one (5 kpc,
if measured in the higher sensitivity map, Fig. 4). Thus, apart
from the random component of the magnetic ﬁeld, NGC 2976
can also supply well-ordered ﬁelds to the IGM, at least within
its closest neighbourhood. Moreover, the calculations presented
above show that this object is not only able to host a large-scale
dynamo, but also creates favourable conditions for it to act at a
level that is typically found in spiral galaxies. This, along with its
low mass, makes NGC 2976 one of the best known instances of
providers of a regular (not just ordered) intergalactic magnetic
ﬁeld. Even in the galaxy NGC 1569, of an H i mass similar to
NGC 2976, with a huge radio halo that extends up to 4 kpc (as
estimated in Fig. 1 from Kepley et al. 2010), no highly polarized
signal was detected at 1.4 GHz (at higher frequencies, a stronger
PI is visible, but it is less extended). Therefore, this object is as
eﬃcient as NGC 2976 in providing random ﬁelds to its neigh-
bourhood, but it is much less eﬃcient in providing ordered and
regular ﬁelds.

Hence, to eﬃciently magnetize the whole M 81 group with
a radius of about 211 kpc (Karachentsev 2005), or at least its
central part, more objects from the pure disk dwarf class are
needed. However, ﬁnding objects like NGC 2976 is diﬃcult be-
cause its morphology seems to be unique. It does not look like
any other known nearby galaxy, featuring a bright sharply-edged
disk, which is perhaps just a short-lived stage within its entire
evolution (Williams et al. 2010). In fact, within the M 81 group,
which consists of 29 galaxies (Karachentsev 2005; or 36 accord-
ing to Karachentsev & Kaisin 2007), only one galaxy can be
found that is similar to NGC 2976, i.e. NGC 4605 (Karachentsev
& Kaisin 2007). This galaxy also has a well-deﬁned stellar disk
and is only slightly larger (with its disk of about 8 kpc) than
NGC 29767. In short, the small number of the galaxies of this
type makes their signiﬁcant role for the group’s magnetization
process rather doubtful. It should be emphasised here that this
conclusion is based only on the observed 1.43 GHz radio enve-

7 It should be noted that NGC 4605 has not been classiﬁed as the
M 81 group member in the Karachentsev (2005) work. However, in a
later paper Karachentsev & Kaisin (2007), it was included in the sample
of group galaxies studied in Hα.

lope. If we assume that the magnetic ﬁeld of NGC 2976 extends
to at least a distance where its H i emission is visible (Chynoweth
et al. 2008), the volume which the object could eﬀectively mag-
netize would be much larger. To detect the full envelope of syn-
chrotron emission that is related to this type of ﬁeld, a new gen-
eration of radio telescopes are needed. LOFAR is one of the best-
suited instruments for this task since it can observe at low fre-
quencies within the range of 30 – 240 MHz. Thus, it would be
able to detect a weak magnetic ﬁeld that is highlighted by low-
energy electrons leaving the disk of NGC 2976.

5. Summary and conclusions

For NGC 2976, a pure-disk dwarf galaxy, deep polarimetric ob-
servations at 1.43 GHz, 4.85 and 8.35 GHz were performed and
then supplemented with re-imaged WSRT-SINGS data. The ra-
dio images that were obtained were compared with data in other
spectral domains, which led to the following conclusions:

– A large total-power and polarized radio envelope surround-

ing the object was discovered.

– The thermal fraction that was estimated using two diﬀerent
methods (giving the complementary results) is about 0.17
(at 1.43 GHz), which is similar to that found in typical spi-
ral galaxies. Also the total magnetic ﬁeld strength (of about
7 µG), its ordered component (of about 3 µG), and degree of
ﬁeld order (of about 0.46), are typical for spiral galaxies, de-
spite the low mass of NGC 2976.

– The analysis of rotation-measure distribution suggests the
possible existence of a coherent,
large-scale dynamo-
generated magnetic ﬁeld in NGC 2976. The dynamo number
calculated for this low-mass galaxy greatly exceeds the crit-
ical value, indicating that, in this object, a large-scale α – ω
dynamo can indeed work eﬃciently. This is quite a surpris-
ing result, since sub-critical dynamo numbers were usually
obtained for other dwarf galaxies studied to date.

– Re-imaging of the WSRT-SINGS data for NGC 2976 reveals
a much more extended polarized signal than in the Heald
et al. (2009) work, which is compatible with our sensitive
VLA 1.43 GHz observations. The RM synthesis shows a sin-
gle point component in the Faraday depth space. This con-
ﬁrms an RM distribution that was obtained by classical radio
polarimetry from two frequencies (1.43 GHz and 4.85 GHz).
– The morphology of the magnetic ﬁeld found in NGC 2976
does not resemble that expected for pure dynamo action
since it features a polarized ridge in the south. This, along
with an undisturbed optical appearance of the object, sug-
gests that its magnetic ﬁeld may ‘remember’ past tidal inter-
actions with the M 81 galaxy (or the centre group galaxies).
It is also possible that the ram pressure of the IGM could
have further modiﬁed the morphology of the magnetic ﬁeld
observed in NGC 2976.

– The number of galaxies with a morphology similar to
NGC 2976 in the M 81 group is not big enough to con-
sider these objects an eﬃcient source of magnetization of
the intra-group medium. These galaxies (taking into account
only the extension of their radio emission) can provide an or-
dered (or even regular) magnetic ﬁeld to their neighbourhood
up to distance of 5 kpc.

– A new weighting scheme, based on the quality of the indi-
vidual frequency channels, for the RM synthesis algorithm
was proposed and investigated. The application of this new
weighting to the simulated data, as well as to the observed

data, results in an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio
in the Faraday depth space.

Appendix A: Application of radio interferometry

weighting to RM synthesis

Processing spectro-polarimetric data using RM synthesis in-
volves the application of frequency channel weighting. The
method currently used (the so-called classic weighting scheme)
consists of assigning weights of 1 to all the observed frequency
channels and 0 to the others.

Obtaining the highest possible resolution in the Faraday do-
main requires observations in a wide spectral band. An example
of this can be found in the WSRT-SINGS survey (Heald et al.
2009), where data were collected in the 18 and 22 cm bands,
simultaneously. As only the weights of 1.0 or 0.0 are assigned
to the particular frequency channels according to the classic
weighting, it is highly desirable to obtain a uniform rms sen-
sitivity across the observed band. However, in practice, it can
be diﬃcult to meet this criterion, which was the case also for the
survey. Furthermore, sensitivities of individual channels within a
single frequency band can considerably diﬀer. This is often due
to problems that are related to RFI or calibration errors. Thus,
treating all (usable) frequency channels in the same way by as-
signing them the same weights of 1.0 does not seem to be the
most adequate solution. In this appendix, we present a novel ap-
proach to weighting data in rotation measure synthesis, which
permits the individual channel sensitivities to be taken into ac-
count.

A.1. Introductiontothenewweightingscheme

Rotation measure synthesis is similar to radio interferometry
(Brentjens & de Bruyn 2005). As such, one can try to write a
formula for the RM Synthesis weight of j-th frequency channel
in a similar way to the single visibility data point in imaging
aperture synthesis observations (e.g. Briggs et al. 1999):

w j(λ2

j) =

R j(λ2

j)T j(λ2

j)D j(λ2
j)
j)D j(λ2
j))

max(R j(λ2

j)T j(λ2

.

(A.1)

In radio interferometry these three elements (of imaging weight)
are deﬁned as follows: R j describes reliability of a given visi-
bility (it is related to the data quality), T j is a tapering function
(related to the position of a given data point in the uv-plane),
and D j is a density-weighting function. The last coeﬃcient can
be used to compensate a non-uniform distribution of data points
in the uv-plane (for more details, see Briggs et al. 1999).

In RM synthesis, we can apply a similar weighting strategy
and assume that R j will describe a quality of an individual data
point (i.e. Q and U Stokes parameters for a given frequency
channel). We propose to approximate R j by the following for-
mula:

R j(λ2

j) =

1

Q(λ2

where, σQ(λ2
j) are the rms noise levels measured
for a particular Q and U frequency channel, respectively. We
chose 1/σ2 weighting, as it is widely used in statistical analysis
and radio-interferometry (e.g. Briggs 1995, Briggs et al. 1999).
Substituting T j = D j = 1 in formula A.1 gives an equivalent
of the so-called natural weighting of uv data points in aperture
synthesis8. To test the new concept, we performed simple simu-
lations of observations which are described below.

A.2. Simulations

In the simulations, we modelled the following three sources in
the Faraday depth domain9 (see Fig. A.2): a pointlike source lo-
cated at a Faraday depth of -10 rad m−2 with ﬂux of 10 Jy, a
source extending from +30 to +50 rad m−2 with total ﬂux of
40 Jy, and a source extending from +90 to +100 rad m−2 with
a total ﬂux of 30 Jy. These three sources (in the Faraday depth
domain) are each seen as a single pointlike source in the sky
plane.

For these sources, we simulated the spectro-polarimetric ob-
servations with a frequency setup similar to that used in the
WSRT-SINGS survey (see Heald et al. 2009). Thus, we ob-
tained two frequency bands (18 cm and 22 cm), each with 512
frequency channels. To simulate some diversity in the quality of
the data channels (caused, e.g. by RFI), we increased noise levels
in some of them. In particular, we increased noise from 2 to 10
times (randomly set) the standard value of 0.1 Jy/beam in 30%
of the randomly chosen maps of the 18 cm band. Similarly, in
the second band (22 cm), 10% of maps have 2 to 5 times higher
rms values. For the data cubes that were simulated in this way
(RA, Dec, frequency), the noise levels were measured in the oﬀ-
source region and regarded as representative of the entire chan-
nel maps.

From these measurements, the channel weights were com-
puted according to the formulas A.1 and A.2, assuming T j = D j
= 1. For the data and weights prepared in this way, RM synthesis
was performed using the software written by the authors.

We measured noise levels (in the same way as for RA, Dec,
frequency data cubes) in the real and imaginary parts of the ob-
tained Faraday dispersion function (RA, Dec, Faraday depth-

data cubes, Fig. A.1). A comparison of these results with the
analogous results calculated with classic (0 or 1) weighting
shows that the rms values in the new approach are systemati-
cally lower. At the same time, the Faraday spectra obtained for
the simulated sources (Fig. A.2) remain approximately the same
for both the weightings (as expected). This implies that the net
result of applying the new weighting is an increase of the signal-
to-noise ratio. For these particular simulated data, the increase
is about two times (the rms value is twice as low). We note that
some small diﬀerences seen in the presented Faraday spectrum
are due to the slightly diﬀerent shapes of RMTFs that were ob-
tained with both weightings (Fig. A.3). In fact, one would ex-
pect a wider main lobe of the RMTF when calculated with the
new approach, as for the radio interferometry, where usually
short baselines have more weight. This side eﬀect is not visible
for this particular setup as here data that possesses higher rms
(lower weights) were generated with nearly uniform distribution
in the simulated spectral band. A similar approach as that pre-
sented here to the data weighting was considered independently
by Heald (2008) and Rudnick & Owen (2014), but few details
are provided there.

A.3. Applicationofthenewweightingschemetotherealdata

To show how the proposed new weighting scheme in the RM
synthesis works in practice, we re-analysed WSRT-SINGS data
for galaxy NGC 2976. For comparison purposes, the dataset was
processed in two ways. In the ﬁrst approach, the classic weight-
ing was applied with values 0 or 1. The second approach was
based on the natural weighting (see above). Before applying RM
synthesis, the data for this galaxy were re-imaged and convolved
to a resolution of about 45” (see Sect. 3.5 for a detailed descrip-
tion).

The rms noise levels measured for particular Q and U Stokes
parameters channel maps were computed in a polygon area,
which was free of polarized emission and as close as possible to
the phase centre. The latter criterion is important to minimize the
inﬂuence of a primary beam’s attenuation (which is frequency-
dependent) on the obtained noise measurements. Having mea-
sured the noise levels, it was possible to calculate the weights
according to the formulas A.1 and A.2 (Fig. A.4). We note that,
in the 18 cm band, the weights are very low when compared to
the 22 cm band. In the next step, the RM Synthesis was per-
formed with the obtained weights included. The results of apply-

weighting for NGC 2976 (WSRT-SINGS data) overlaid onto the

ing the new weighting scheme and the classic one are compared
in Figures 9 and A.5, where distributions of polarized emission
and B-vectors are shown. As can be seen, there are less artifacts
in the map obtained using the new weighting strategy. In fact, the
noise level measured for this map is about 25 µJy/beam, while
for the map obtained in the classic way, it is about 30 µJy/beam.
Thus, because of taking into account the appropriate weights for
each frequency channel, it was possible to reduce noise level in
the resulting PI map by about 20%.

A.4. Strongandweakpointsofthenewweightingscheme

Increasing sensitivity of the Faraday dispersion function is the
main advantage of the new weighting scheme. In this method,
the best quality channels have the highest weights while the
poorest ones are underweighted. It can be easily understood by
recalling the fact that the rotation-measure synthesis is based on
the Fourier transform, which in turn uses sine and cosine func-
tions for a signal’s sampling. The energy contained in these func-
tions is inﬁnite, because they are not limited to any particular λ2.
Thus the channels, which are less sensitive than the others, will
limit sensitivity of the resulting power spectrum (the Faraday
dispersion function). When we underweight these poor-quality
channels, we also automatically limit the contribution of the high
level of noise associated with them (and usually also some imag-
ing artifacts) to the Faraday dispersion function. We note here
that some factors, which could contribute to the reduction of
noise level in our data, could be due to the particular dataset’s
channels that were assigned higher weights (22 cm) also having
had a greater ﬁeld of view.

Apart from sensitivity, the new weighting can also aﬀect
the shape of the rotation-measure transfer function. In Figure
A.6, both RMTFs, those obtained with the classic and the new
weighting are presented. The latter shows a reduced level of side
lobes (which is desirable) but, at the same time, their minima

become much higher (which is not desirable). The other non-
desirable eﬀect is an increase of the width of the main lobe of
RMTF in the new weighting (about 1.5 times), compared to the
classic one.

It is also worth noting that the directions of B-vectors (not
corrected for RM) on images (Fig. 9 and A.5) that were ob-
tained with both methods diﬀer by small amounts. This is due
to the mean weighted λ2 for which directions of B-vectors are
computed not being the same in both approaches.
