We introduce an intuitive mechanism to describe both the emergence of community structure and the evolution
of the internal structure of communities in social networks. Our idea is based on the simple assumption that each
individual can, for every social group to which it belongs, develop connections and introduce new members.
Complex behaviors emerge from opposing time scales for the activities of individuals and for the sum of
individuals gathered in groups. We show how the resulting model reproduces behaviors observed in real social
networks and in the anthropological theory known as Dunbar’s number, i.e. the empirical observation of a
maximal number of ties which an average individual can sustain within its social groups. Using this growth
process, we organically reproduce the micro and mesoscopic structure of social networks. In so doing, we
highlight two interesting properties of the community structure of social networks. First, strong correlations
between the number of communities to which a node belong and the number of connections therein; correlating
the role of a node in the community structure and its role in the structure of the communities. Second, Dunbar’s
number in the structure of communities implies a vanishing group density regardless of the nature of the network
or of the detection algorithm.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Networks are at the center of the quantitative analysis of
social systems [1]. They encode the links between different
individuals within a mathematical construct that allows quan-
tiﬁcation of the role of individuals in social networks through
multiple metrics, and the analysis of correlations among them
[1, 2]. One instance of these correlations, the similarity be-
tween the neighborhoods of different nodes (individuals), has
received particular attention since links tend to be clustered in
tightly connected groups [3, 4]. Networks are often expressed
as a superposition of such densely connected groups, and we
refer to this decomposition as the community structure of a
network [5, 6]. This structure not only informs us about the
current state of a network, but also helps predict missing or fu-
ture links [7, 8], and leads to better models of many dynamical
processes on networks [9–12]. This arises because the com-
munity structure encapsulates possible correlations between
nodes [13], or possible origins for the links (e.g. groups of
individuals with similar interests or sharing a workplace) [14].
Information pertaining to the community structure of a net-
work is only valuable if it is known to some degree of cer-
tainty. This leads to the problem of community detection. How
can one efﬁciently decompose a network in a set of mean-
ingful communities, by using its structure and no other prior
knowledge? The number and diversity of available approaches
[4, 13, 15–22] only serve to illustrate both the difﬁculty of
answering the question, and the absence of consensus on the
very deﬁnition of communities. Although, the multiplicity of
deﬁnitions is not problematic per se, the implications of such
diversity are far reaching, since diverging deﬁnitions of the
structure of communities entail different community structures,
and vice-versa. This reciprocal dependence is at the core of
our paper.

Erd˝os-R´enyi (ER) graphs are perhaps the most prevailing
approximation for the structure of communities, both in the
context of community detection [22, 23] and of network mod-

eling [7, 8, 24, 25]. These random graphs are generated either
by randomly distributing m links among the n nodes of a
graph [G(n, m) ensemble] or by setting a probability p of
existence to every possible link [G(n, p) ensemble] [26, 27].
Erd˝os-R´enyi graphs are mostly used because of their simplic-
ity, but also because it is often argued that the lowest level of
description of a network should not exhibit any structure [24].
While this sound statistical principle has yielded stunning
results in both community detection and network modeling
[7, 8, 24], one can hardly expect ER graphs to realistically
describe communities as the basic building blocks of social
system, since random graphs ensemble with uncorrelated links
contain communities with disconnected subsets of nodes, in
direct violation of one of the basic tenets of the concept of com-
munity. A subtle and even more serious issue also becomes
apparent when one views networks as snapshots of growing
complex systems. Indeed, it has been shown time and time
again that heterogeneity stems from the history of growing
systems [14, 28–30]. Since communities are the basic building
blocks of such systems, they must in turn exhibit heterogeneity,
both in their sizes and in their internal structures. Sophisti-
cated random graphs models that incorporate inhomogeneities
[9, 12, 31] are closer to reality, but still not completely suit-
able models for the structure of communities, because having
hardwired internal structures make the problem of detection
exponentially harder, and yield no temporal information or
insights on the growth process. The Preferential Attachment
model [28] does not suffer from these issues, but highly het-
erogeneous degree distributions at all community sizes make
it unsuitable for our purpose; while big communities might
exhibit some inhomogeneity, one expects small communities
(e.g. families, working groups) to be uniformly connected.

In this paper, we provide a solution to these problems by
introducing a simple, organic and realistic growth process that
reproduces both the local structure of communities and the
global statistical properties of overlapping community struc-
tures. Power-law-like behavior has been found to be a good

approximation for many of the statistical properties at the com-
munity structure level [16, 32]. It follows that the evolution
of the degree distribution (links per node), the membership
distribution (groups per node) and the size distribution (nodes
per group) can be modeled through preferential attachment.
We will focus on the recently introduce Structural Preferential
Attachment model (SPA), where nodes join new communities
at a rate proportional to their current membership number and
communities gain new members at a rate proportional to their
size (i.e. preferentially) [14, 29]. We show how SPA not only
ensures an heterogeneous community structure akin to the ob-
served structure of real networks, but also how it is compatible,
both in practice and in spirit, with a local growth model for the
structure of communities. This local model generates small, ho-
mogeneous and connected communities which, when they are
allowed to grow larger, become increasingly inhomogeneous.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we de-
scribe the process by which a single community and its struc-
ture may grow (further details are presented in Appendix A).
In Sec. III, we incorporate this process within a preferential
attachment model at the community structure level and provide
a recipe for its implementation. In Sec. IV, we compare our
model with real social networks, and investigate its implica-
tions. We then present our conclusions in Sec. V. Sections II
and IV C provide a succinct overview of how our work relate
to the theory of Dunbar’s number, while the other sections are
mainly concerned with practical matters and complete network
modeling.

II. GROWTH OF THE STRUCTURE OF COMMUNITIES

Our model for the structure of communities is based on the
hypothesis that community growth is governed by preferential
attachment (i.e. we assume that a community grows with a rate
proportional to its current size). This hypothesis is known to
reproduce the statistical properties of the community structure
of real networks [14, 29], and can be interpreted as if each
member of a community introduces a new member at a given
rate: The more members, the faster the community grows. In
this section, we obtain a complete model of the growth of a
community by combining this simple node creation mechanism
to an elementary link creation mechanism.

A. Description of the model and mean-ﬁeld analysis

The model is simply stated. Each member of a commu-
nity of size n recruits new members at rate ρn, such that the
growth rate ˙n(t) of a community of size n is proportional to
nρn. A new member is initially connected to the individual
who introduced it within the group (its degree k, i.e. number
of neighbors, therefore equals 1 within this community). This
ﬁrst link ensures the connectedness of the community. To al-
low for denser communities, we introduce another mechanism
whereby each member creates new links at a rate ρ(cid:96) until it
is connected to every other member, i.e. until its degree is
equal to n − 1. A receiving individual is selected randomly

2

among the unconnected members (self-loops or doubled links
are forbidden). Consequently, the degree of a single member
grows faster than the link creation rate ρ(cid:96), because it can both
create and receive (undirected) links.

The average number nk(t) of nodes (members) with degree
k within an average community of size n can be followed
through time t with the interdependent rate equations

(cid:0)nk−1 − nk
(cid:35)
− ((cid:98)n(cid:99) − k − 1)nk
where (cid:98)n(cid:99) is the integer part of n, where X :=(cid:80)(cid:98)n(cid:99)−2
Z :=(cid:80)(cid:98)n(cid:99)−2

k(cid:48)=1 nk(cid:48)(t)
is the number of nodes that can create new links, and where
k(cid:48)=1 ((cid:98)n(cid:99) − 1 − k(cid:48)) nk(cid:48) is the total number of poten-
tial links. The ﬁrst term accounts for the arrival of new nodes:
each existing node recruits at rate ρn, and gain new connections
accordingly. This creates a ﬂow that brings a node of degree
k− 1 to degree k [positive effect on nk(t)], and node of degree
k to degree k + 1 [negative effect]. The second term is due to
the creation of internal links, and behaves exactly like the ﬁrst
term. The third term accounts for the receiving end of links
created by existing nodes: these events occur at rate ρ(cid:96)X and
affect nodes of degree k with probability ((cid:98)n(cid:99) − k − 1)nk/Z.
We take the integer part of the community size n to capture
the fact that the maximal degree (cid:98)n(cid:99) − 1 only increases when
a new node is recruited, i.e. when the integer part of n jumps
from x to x + 1.
Some events do not inﬂuence the number of nodes of degrees
k = 0, 1,(cid:98)n(cid:99)−1, and (cid:98)n(cid:99), and the following set of rate equations
is needed to cover all special cases.

(1e)
Note that when (cid:98)n(cid:99) ≤ 2, the set of Eqs. (1) should, but
do not, collapse into a smaller set of consistent equations.
This inconsistency is easily avoided since all the problematic
cases – communities which initially contain a single node
or a single link – deterministically evolve toward triads (see
Fig. 1). As a result, one can use the equivalent initial condition
(cid:126)n(t0) = (n0 = 0, n1 = 2, n2 = 1) whenever the actual initial
conﬁguration would lead to inconsistent equations.

The time t of the process has no physical meaning, since
different communities have different “initial times” and are
only distinguishable by their sizes. Summing Eqs. (1a)–(1e),
one ﬁnds

˙nk(t) = nρn .

together with the observation that

We assume a uniform and uncorrelated distribution of links
among individuals, and we deﬁne Lmax(n) = n(n − 1)/2,
the maximal number of links in a community of size n(t). A

As previously stated, a node will not create new links if its
degree equals n− 1 (see Sec. II B). The rest of the nodes create
new links at a rate ρ(cid:96). The total link creation rate is therefore
approximately given by

and where the second term is equivalent to nρ(cid:96)(1 − ˜pn−1) ≡

While the actual link distribution is neither uniform nor uncor-
related in the complete model (see Fig. 2), we will see that our
simpliﬁcation is robust, and that Eq. (6) accurately reproduces
the average internal degree of communities (see Sec. II C).
A simple analysis of Eq. (6) highlights an interesting feature
of the model. For large sizes n, the factor [L/Lmax(n)]n−1
goes rapidly to zero, such that a maximal link creation rate

(cid:39) 1 + r

is attained. Hence, the intensive quantity L/n → (1 + r) con-
verges toward a constant that depends on the parametrization
of the model alone. Considering that one link equals two stubs
(or degree), the asymptotic average degree is directly related
to the parameter r through:

(cid:104)k(cid:105) =

2L
n

= 2 (1 + r) .

(8)

This indicates a maximal average number of connections in
social group.

C. Relation with Dunbar’s number

The results of Fig. 3 highlight the two different behaviors
for the average number of links per individual in relation to
the size of a social group. For low average sizes n, the mean
degree (cid:104)k(n)(cid:105) scales linearly with the community size n. In
other words, the model captures the fact that everybody knows
everybody within small groups (e.g. family or close friends).
At larger sizes n, (cid:104)k(n)(cid:105) reaches the plateau 2 (1 + r) given by
Eq. (8). From this point onwards, a typical individual will not

communities. Random effects only occur once internal link creation
becomes possible. Hence, initial conditions of the form (cid:126)n(t0) =
(n0 = 0, . . . , ns−1 = s) [top] and of the form (cid:126)n(t0) = (n0 =
0, n1 = 1, . . . , ns−1 = s − 1, ns = 1) [bottom] are equivalent.

with similar expressions for the limit cases of Eqs. (1). This
formulation has the added beneﬁt of highlighting the depen-
dency in the relative ratio of events r := ρ(cid:96)/ρn. We validate
Eq. (3) in Fig. 2, where we show that our mean-ﬁeld descrip-
tion captures the important features of the growth dynamics.
The discrepancy between simulations and the results of Eq. (3)
can be traced back to the continuous approximation involved in
writing differential mean-ﬁeld equations for discrete quantities,
as well as the absence of structural correlation in this type of
model. The net effect is a slight shift of the prediction toward
higher degrees for the bulk of the distribution.

Nonetheless, Fig. 2 clearly shows that small and medium
size communities are highly homogeneous, while degree dis-
tributions of larger communities are heavily skewed. This
heterogeneity arises from the history of the community; the
few nodes that join early, when growth is slower, can create
more links than the many nodes who join the community as
growth accelerates. This qualitative behavior holds for ar-
bitrary values of r, but the transition from homogeneous to
heterogeneous degree distributions occur on very different size
scales, for different choices of r.

B. Approximate average degree

A simpler point of view can be adopted to gain further
insights into the relation between the internal degree (cid:104)k(cid:105) =
2L/n of an average node and the size n(t) of its community,
where L(t(n)) is the number of links at time t(n).

compare the results of Eq. (3) (small dots) with the average of 20 000 Monte-Carlo simulations (closed symbols). Lines are added to the
analytical results to guide the eye. A bulge appears in the distributions for n (cid:29) 1. It corresponds to the signature of a peloton dynamics [29].
We gather some remarks on this dynamics in Appendix A.

to maintain such relationships. While the importance of neo-
cortical sizes [34] and the generality of the results [35] are both
disputable, the fact remains that empirical evidence supports
the existence of an upper bound in the absolute number of
active relationships for an average individual [36].

In our intuitive model, this upper bound naturally emerges
and is solely dependent on the parameter r. This parameter
can be interpreted as the ratio between the involvement of an
individual in a community, in the sense of bonding with other
members, and its contribution to the growth rate of the com-
munity. For low r or large community sizes, the rate of change
in the population is higher than an individual’s involvement,
such that the maximal degree stagnates. Whereas, for high
r and small communities, the individual is able to follow the
population changes and hence create relationships with most
of its members. Different types of social organizations will
feature different r and consequently different values of “Dun-
bar’s number” (an online social network, where relationships
are easily maintained, will lead to higher values of r than a co-
author network for example). Note that we do not interpret the
plateau as an absolute upper bound, but rather as a bound on
the maximal number of connections that an average individual
can maintain.

In this interpretation, the upper bound for individual de-
gree in social groups is due to the fact that connections and
introduction of new members have linear requirements for in-
dividuals, but exponential consequences for the group. Other
mathematical models exist to describe Dunbar’s number (e.g.
[36]), usually based on arguments of priority and/or time re-
sources [37]. However, our model is based on the observed
structure of the communities of real world networks and con-
sequently, explains Dunbar’s number in terms of its two basic
units, individuals and groups, and the ratio of their respective

FIG. 3. (color online) Internal degree (cid:104)k(n)(cid:105) of an average node as a
function of community size n. We compare the prediction of Eq. 6
(lines) with the average of 50 000 Monte-Carlo simulations, for r = 2
(lozenge), r = 4 (inverted triangles), r = 8 (squares), r = 16 (circle),
and r = 32 (triangles). Asymptotic agreement is excellent, and only
small deviations can be observed near the inﬂexion points.

gain new connections when the potential number of connec-
tions is increased. So, while there is no maximal community
size per se, there is a maximal number of connections that an
average individual might possess within a given group (e.g.
large companies or online communities). This effectively im-
plies a maximal community size since the connection density
will decrease as size is increased, until the community barely
qualiﬁes as a group.
Interestingly, this upper-bound of average individual activity
(cid:104)k(n)(cid:105) has been previously observed in studies related to an
anthropological theory known as Dunbar’s number [33]. This
theory is based on the observed relation between neocortical
sizes in primates and the average sizes of their social groups.
Its interpretation usually involves information constraints re-
lated to the quality of interpersonal connections and our ability

III. GROWTH OF THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE

We now bridge the gap between the local community growth
model of Sec. II and the Structural Preferential Attachment
(SPA) model of Refs. [14] and [29]. SPA builds upon the idea
that networks can be interpreted as projections of higher struc-
tural levels, such as communities [38]. From this community-
centric point of view, groups do not emerge because links get
clustered; instead, individuals join communities and then form
links with their other members. SPA thus models network
growth by considering that all events consist of a node joining
a community.

A. Structural Preferential Attachment

The essence of SPA can be summarized as follows [14]. At
every discrete time step, a growth event occurs. An event marks
the birth of a new node with probability q, and the creation of
a new fully connected community of s nodes, with probability
p. When an existing node or community is involved (with
complementary probabilities 1 − q and 1 − p respectively),
it is chosen preferentially to its past activity: A node with x
memberships or a community of size x is x times more likely to
be chosen than a node/community with 1 membership/member.
This simultaneous preferential attachment ensures that both
the membership and size distributions converge to a fat-tailed
distribution. The probability q controls how interconnected
communities are, the probability p controls the average size
of communities, and the size s allows one to enforce minimal
connectivity in the full system. In SPA, every link belongs to
a community, and a large-scale connectivity of the network is
achieved through overlapping node communities.

We can write rate equations to follow the numbers Nm of
nodes belonging to m groups and the number Sn of groups with
n nodes. These equations are similar to most linear preferential
attachment equations

Nm(t+1) = Nm(t) + qδm,1

B. Coupling discrete and continuous processes

Our goal is to incorporate the simple local mechanism of
Sec. II within the SPA model for heterogeneous community
structures. To do so, we must determine the precise relation
between the time scales of SPA and that of the local model,
thereby allowing a concurrent simulation of both processes.
This is not a simple matter, since one must reconcile the con-
tinuous nature of the local growth mechanism with the discrete
nature of SPA.

In SPA, time ˜T is measured in number of events. Without
loss of generality and for reasons that will become apparent
shortly, let us deﬁne a rescaled discrete time scale T in which
a fraction  of the time steps lead to SPA events, such that
T = ˜T . The community structure does not change during the
remaining (1 − )T time steps. Because a time step ˜T marks
the birth of a new community (of size s) with probability p, or
the growth of an existing one with complementary probability
1 − p, we can write the time dependent sum of the sizes ni(T )
of all communities as

ni(T ) =  T(cid:2)ps + (1 − p)(cid:3) =  T(cid:2)1 + p(s − 1)(cid:3). (13)

The average size ni(T ) of community i in discrete time T is
then governed by a rate equation

where we have deﬁned α(p, s) := (1 − p)/[1 + p(s − 1)].
Equation (14) merely states that growth events will affect com-
j nj(T ) (i.e. preferentially
to its size). In the limit of large times, (14) can be rewritten as

(15)

Now, recall that the size ni(t) of a community grows expo-

nentially in continuous time t as

= ni(t)ρn .

Combining time derivatives (15) and (16) yields a relation

This result holds provided that ni(t) = ni(T ) at all time. As
such, Eq. (17) is valid for all communities (i.e. there exists a
single time scale for all communities) and it can be used to
express both processes on a uniﬁed time scale. We choose to

since discrete time scales are generally easier to handle.

The ﬁrst part of the local model (nodes are recruited at rate
nρn) is easily accounted for: Whenever a node joins a new
community, we simply choose a recruiting node uniformly
among the current members of that community, and form a
new link. The exponential growth of communities in SPA
ensures that this process is consistent with the model of Sec. II.
The second part of the local model (internal links are created
at rate ∝ nρ(cid:96)) entails a more involved analysis. Let us deﬁne
˜ni(t) as the effective size of community i, i.e. the number of
nodes that are allowed to create links (those with less than
ni(t) − 1 links within community i). Then, in the local model,
the number of links L(t) in a community of effective size ˜ni(t)
grows at a rate

The purpose of time transformation  T = ˜T is then apparent:
It can be adjusted to bound r(1 − p) to the interval [0, 1] for
all r ∈ R+. Since  is an arbitrary fraction which also lies in
[0, 1], we adopt the simplest choice, i.e.

 =

Equation (19) can then be interpreted in two ways. Straight-
forwardly, we may say that at each time step dT of the SPA
process, a new link is created between the existing members of
the communities of effective size ˜ni with a probability given
by the RHS of (19), for all i. Alternatively, we may say that
at each time step dT of the SPA process, a new link is created
with probability r (1 − p), in a community selected with a
j nj(T ).
Equation (20) ensures that this interpretation is always sensi-
ble. In both interpretations, the source of the link is selected
uniformly among all the nodes of degree k < n − 1, and the
target node is selected uniformly among all possible targets
(the nodes to which the source is not connected).

i ˜ni(T )/(cid:80)

Note that the ratio ˜ni(T )/(cid:80)
time step dT , there is a probability 1 −(cid:80)
ratio ˜ni(T )/(cid:80)

j nj(T ) is not normalized. In
the context of the second interpretation, this implies that at each
j nj(T )
that no link creation event will occur. Alternatively, we may
select the community in which the link creation event occurs
proportionally to its actual size ni(T ), and select the source
node uniformly among all the nodes of that community. The
j nj(T ) will then be effectively respected if
we consider that a link creation simply “fails” whenever the
randomly selected source node has the maximal number of
connections.

The above analysis yields a straightforward algorithm for
the modiﬁed version of SPA (hereafter SPA+) [39]. Starting
with disjoint and fully connected communities of size s, at
each discrete time step T :

1: a new community of size s is created with probability
p, or an existing one (chosen preferentially to its size)
grows with probability (1 − p);
1.a: if a community birth event has been selected, one
of the s involved nodes is a new one with proba-
bility q or an existing one (chosen preferentially
to its current memberships) with complementary
probability 1− q. The other s− 1 nodes are chosen
preferentially, among existing nodes;

1.b: if a community growth event has occurred, the
involved node is a new one with probability q or
an existing one (chosen preferentially to its current
membership) with probability 1 − q. This node
then randomly selects an existing member of the
community (uniformly) and creates a link;

2: with probability r (1 − p) , a new link is created in a
community chosen preferentially to its size. It connects a
uniformly chosen node, and a uniformly chosen potential
neighbor, provided that the source node is not already
connected to every node in the community.

If r(1 − p) < 1, link creation occurs on slower time scale than
community structure related events, whereas the converse is
true if r(1 − p) > 1.

C. Parameters estimation

SPA+ efﬁciently grows networks with heterogeneous com-
munity structure and communities with realistic internal struc-
tures. We now turn to the problem of parameters ﬁtting. Most
of the parameters, e.g. s, or the ﬁnal size N, are automatically
set by the system that one wishes to model. This leaves three
free parameters: p ∈ [0, 1] (size of communities), q ∈ [0, 1]
(memberships of nodes), and r ∈ [0,∞) (density of communi-
ties). In this section, we explain how to ﬁt r, since the relation
between p, q and the community structure is extensively dis-
cussed in [14, 29]. In the following, all estimated values of the
parameters will be afﬁxed with a caret: ˆp, ˆq, and ˆr.

1. Density estimators

There exist two obvious methods to ﬁt r to empirical data.
The ﬁrst is a straightforward least square estimator (LSE); it
compares the distance between the observed average degree
(cid:104)k(n)(cid:105) in groups of size n and the analytical prediction of
Eq. (6) for (cid:104)k(n; r)(cid:105) = 2L(n; r)/n. By minimizing the dis-
tance over all r, one obtains the estimate ˆr. The other method
relies on likelihood maximization (MLE), and uses the results
of the rate equations of Sec. II A. Deﬁne {ki,(cid:96)}, the sequence
of internal degrees of a real network, where i refers to node

background for N = 10 000 and rm = 2 to illustrate the qualitative
corrections that must be applied to ˆr0 (see main text for the deﬁnition).
The color map is only indicative of the actual corrections that are
calculated separately for each N. We ﬁnd the following values of

(Enron, OSLOM) and 1.04 (MathSciNet, GCE).

signiﬁcantly alter the predictions of Eq. (3) and (6), on which
our estimators rely. We have assumed that a community grows
on its own and draws new members from an inﬁnite reservoir
of indistinguishable nodes. In practice, the reservoir is ﬁnite
and each node therein is tagged. We argue that a systematic
bias is introduced by two important ﬁnite size effects, and that
it can be removed with a procedure explained below.

First, when a community grows by recruiting a new mem-
ber, the member is selected randomly from all existing nodes.
In ﬁnite systems, the same node can (and will) be recruited
twice by the same community. To respect the relative rates of
all events and preserve the mean-ﬁeld mapping of Sec III B,
we consider that this node is effectively a new one. This im-
plies that a node can be connected to multiple copies of itself.
When we construct the full system at the end of the growth
process, we collapse the redundant memberships into a single
membership, which (a) skews the tail of membership and size
distribution and (b) removes self-loops from the system. Sec-
ond, a further ﬁnite size effect arises because it is possible for
two nodes to share more than one community, such that the
internal density of a community can be inﬂated by links that
were created in different communities.

To delineate the ﬁnite-size effects at play and their impact on
our estimates of ˆr, we construct a number of SPA+ networks
and obtain their matrices of internal degrees {ki,(cid:96)} using infor-
mations that is not available to an observer who does not know
the history of the system. We then apply our estimators to these
matrices and establish how each ﬁnite-size effect inﬂuences
our estimate of ˆr. The numerical results of this investigation
are displayed in Fig. 4 for N = 10 000.

The estimators are ﬁrst calibrated on pure internal structures
(Fig. 4.a-b), where we analyze each communities separately,
without collapsing memberships. In the pure case, the quality
of our estimate of r only depends on p, through its effect on
sample size and the time-mapping. As p increases the inference
task becomes harder, because communities mostly live in the
fully connected regime, where there are few discriminating

ﬁgures display the ratios of the estimates ˆr to the value of r used to
create the data, for all pairs of (p, q). We use these ratios to quantify
the ﬁnite-size bias of our estimators. A perfect match is color coded
in white, whereas under- (over-) estimates appear in shades of blue
(yellow). The ratios are largely independent of r, and qualitatively
similar ∀ N. Their precise values depend however on N. (a-b) Esti-

communities, the log-likelihood L that r was used to generate
the sequence {ki,(cid:96)} is then

This probability is obtained by numerical integration of Eq. (3),
and one estimates ˆr by maximizing Eq. (21) over all r.

2. Finite size effects and correction mask

While both estimators work well in theory, a few imple-
mentation issues arise because we have developed our internal
mechanism in a mean-ﬁeld framework; we ignore effects that

features.

We then consider collapsed internal structures (Fig. 4.c-d),
which are obtained by merging duplicate nodes into single
entities, and then removing self-loops and parallel links. Com-
munities that contain multiple copies of a same node decrease
both in size and number of links. The membership collapsing
procedure only affects our estimate of r at very low (p, q), i.e.
for parameters that yield highly redundant communities. For
the majority of (p, q) pairs, the bias is small for both estimators:
The estimated value ˆr deviates from the true value by at most
25%, for 60.9% (LSE) and 80.1% (MLE) of the (p, q) pairs.
A signiﬁcant bias is however introduced when one does not
assign links to speciﬁc communities. This is what we call the
collapsed & overlapping structures, where links increase the
density of all the communities to which they belong, rather
than a single one. This ﬁnal case encompasses all the ﬁnite
size biases, and makes use of the information that should be
recovered by mean of a perfect community detection algorithm.
As shown by our results, the bias is more pronounced in the
signiﬁcantly overlapping regime p < q, where communities
grow slower than the node reservoir (see Sec. III B).

While not a problem per se, this bias must nevertheless be
removed when ﬁtting SPA+ to empirical data. Since most
overlapping community detection algorithms do not explic-
itly assign links, we are often placed in the “collapsed and
overlapping” case. We use the following modeling procedure
to account for the ﬁnite-size bias: (i) obtain the parameters
(ˆp, ˆq) that best model the community structure, (ii) compute
an initial estimate ˆr0 of the strength of the internal connec-
tivity of communities, and (iii) ﬁnally obtain the corrected
estimated parameter ˆr, as ˆr = ˆr0/m(ˆp, ˆq; N ). The correction
m(ˆp, ˆq; N ) is the value of the bias removal mask for networks
of N nodes, at point (ˆp, ˆq) (see Fig. 5). Since the mask depends
on the network size N, it is computed for each network sepa-
rately. In practice, we obtain m(ˆp, ˆq; N ) by ﬁrst generating a
number of SPA+ networks of N nodes with ﬁxed parameters
(ˆp, ˆq, r = rm). We have found that the ﬁnal results are almost
independent on the precise value of rm; we have used rm = 2
but rm = ˆr0 is an equally good choice. We then extract ˆrm
from the collapsed and overlapping communities (averaged
over the number of SPA+ networks realizations), and take

m(ˆp, ˆq; N ) = ˆrm/rm. This bias removal mask accounts for
ﬁnite size effects and allows us to generate networks with mean
internal degrees on a (cid:104)k(n)(cid:105) curve that resemble the empirical
data.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The SPA model has previously been shown to capture sev-
eral properties of the community structure of real networks
[14, 29]. We now investigate these properties anew by model-
ing three social networks: Co-authorship networks obtained
from the arXiv circa 2005 [16] and from MathSciNet circa
2008 [40], as well as the email exchange network from Enron
[41]. We detect their community structure with ﬁve different
algorithms: A link clustering algorithm [19] (LCA), a greedy
clique expansion algorithm [20] (GCE), the order statistics lo-
cal optimization method [42] (OSLOM), a greedy modularity
optimization of line-graphs algorithm [43] (LG), and a cas-
cading approach to clique percolation [16, 44] (CCPA). This
provides us with a total of 15 systems, from which we have se-
lected 5 representative examples. Note that three of the above
algorithms (LCA, LG, CCPA) identify link partitions, while
the other two directly ﬁnd overlapping node communities. We
translate link partitions into node communities to analyze every
algorithm on a common basis, where the true community of a
link is unknown.

A. Modeling real networks

As discussed in Sec. III C, we model a real network by
choosing a value for the tuple of parameters (p, q, r). The
parameters p and q are ﬁtted using the memberships and size
distributions of the empirical data [14]. In practice, we obtain
a ﬁrst approximation for p and q using a systematic method for
estimating power-law exponents by likelihood maximization
[45]. We then adjust (p, q) to account for the fact that empirical
distributions are not pure power-law. We use the MLE of
Sec. III C to ﬁt r to the the sequence of internal degrees {ki,(cid:96)}.

networks with their empirical counterparts. We obtain good
agreement in general. However, it is immediately clear that the
empirical distributions are not all pure power laws, such that
our model is bound to fail in some cases. Our model produces
heterogeneous community structure with scale-free behavior,
and we aim to stay within this framework; as long as we
consider scale-free systems, we can ﬁt both the size and mem-
bership distribution robustly and independently [29, 45]. This
is why we obtain good agreements in sizes [see Fig. 6(a)-(d)]
and memberships [Fig. 6(a)-(e)] for most analyzed community
structures. However, when the empirical distributions decay
erratically [e.g. Fig. 6(a)] or too slowly, [e.g. Fig. 6(e)], we
only obtain an approximate agreement.

Due to the nature of our model, the quality of the predicted
degree distribution is inherently connected to the quality of the
predicted size and membership distributions. It can be shown
that the global degree distribution of SPA+ networks cannot
decay more slowly than the membership and size distributions.
The reason is that links are created within communities, such
that the number and size of the communities of a node limit
its maximal degree (See Ref. [29] for a full discussion). If the
community structure is properly described by the SPA model
[see Fig. 6(a-d)], we expect SPA+ to reproduce the global de-
gree distributions to some extent. When it is not the case, SPA+
generates network with a global degree distribution that falls
too rapidly [see Fig. 6(d)-(e)], and inaccuracies in the commu-
nity structure are reﬂected in the global degree distributions,
even if our internal model ﬁts the empirical data nicely [see
Fig. 8]. This effect explains why we cannot model the degree
distribution of Enron network as described by OSLOM [notice
the abnormally large and densely connected communities of
size n ≈ 103 in Fig. 6(d)], and of the MathSciNet network as
described by GCE [see Fig. 6(e)].

B. Correlations between community structure

and the structure of communities

Additional properties are also captured by SPA+. The results
shown in Fig. 7 investigate correlations between the organi-
zation within communities and the overarching community
structure. We obtain the relation between the average internal
degree of a node within communities of size n (i.e. the “social
involvement” of an individual within a group), and its member-
ship number m, in empirical datasets and the corresponding
simulated networks. We quantify this relationship by the ratio
(cid:104)k(n, m)(cid:105)/(cid:104)k(n, 1)(cid:105).

Generally, all algorithms except GCE ﬁnd that nodes active
in the community structure (high number m of memberships)
tend to be also active within communities (high average inter-
nal degree (cid:104)k(cid:105)). Even though agreement is not perfect, our
model reproduces this effect through age-memberships and
age-degree correlations. While the available data does not tell
whether these correlations are indeed age-related, it is natural
to assume that authors or employees who have been active for
a longer time within the archive or the company, tend to have
more groups and more relations within them. To the best of

community sizes n and average internal degree (cid:104)k(n, m)(cid:105) measured
in relation to (cid:104)k(n, 1)(cid:105). Black squares indicate missing data. Note
that, without the addition of our link creation mechanism, the SPA
model does not include any correlations, even when one considers a
given density function of community sizes (i.e. for the SPA model,
on average, (cid:104)k(n, m)(cid:105) = (cid:104)k(n, 1)(cid:105) on average for all n and m).

our knowledge, these correlations are not considered in other
growth models, but naturally emerge from our link creation
mechanism. In essence, this means that individuals acting as
hubs in the community structure (many memberships), tend to
act also as hubs within the structure of their communities.

C. Some implications of Dunbar’s number

V. CONCLUSION

In Sec. II C, we have discussed the theoretical relation be-
tween our model for the structure of communities and a cog-
nitive limit in an individual’s social relationships known as
Dunbar’s number. In our model, this limit stems from the ratio
of effort put in building new connections ρn and in increasing
group size ρ(cid:96), which constraints the average internal degree
in large groups. In Fig. 8, we observe a similar behavior in
our social network datasets. The empirical results are also
compared with our model using our least square estimates for
ˆr0.

The observed plateau implies a vanishing average density
(cid:104)ρ(n)(cid:105), i.e. fraction of potential links that exist, for large com-
munities. Regardless of the nature of the network, of the com-
munity detection algorithm and of the parameters (p, q, r, s),
the simple existence of the plateau implies that community
density vanishes as (cid:104)ρ(n)(cid:105) ∼ n−1. This is obviously true in
our model, and observed for our datasets in Fig. 8. Only the
community structure of Enron as detected by LG stands out
from the prediction. One could argue that this limit is in fact
universal, since non-vanishing densities would imply overly
dense communities at large sizes. Further empirical studies
would however be required to support this claim.

We have introduced a simple model for the growth of the
internal structure of communities which is consistent with em-
pirical observations (vanishing density, varying heterogeneity).
As a by-product, we have shown how this model offers a simple
explanation of the theory of Dunbar’s number.

Furthermore, we have shown how our local model ﬁts in the
broader context of structural preferential attachment, and how
the resulting model reproduces the well-known heterogeneity
of the membership, size, degree and internal degree distri-
butions, independently of the network and of our detection
algorithm. This led to better insights on the relation between
the community structure and the structure of communities. As
a result, we have identiﬁed a seldom studied ubiquitous proper-
ties of the internal structure of network, namely the correlation
between the activity of a node within communities (i.e. its role
in the structure of its communities) and within the network (i.e.
its role in bridging communities).

Due to its universality, we argue that SPA+ could be used
as a high-quality proxy for realistic network structures. In
fact, because it grows realistic and varied networks with full
community structure metadata, we are presently applying our
model as a benchmarking tool for community detection algo-
rithms. SPA+ offers the possibility to create networks with
communities of vanishingly small link density. The point will
be to test the robustness of algorithms in these controlled situa-

studied in Ref. [29]. It is a ﬁnite-size effect related to the lead-
ers dynamics; groups of highly connected individuals result
in a clearly identiﬁable bulge in the internal degree distribu-
tion. Averaging over multiple realizations of the growth of
a community leads to the creation of a peloton where one is
signiﬁcantly more likely to ﬁnd entities than predicted by the
asymptotic distribution. Because the same peloton evolves
with growing n, it is expected to retain its shape across a large
range of community sizes. The simplest scaling Ansatz takes
the form

pk(n; r) (cid:39) k−α(r) G(k/nβ(r))

for

n (cid:29) 1 ,

(A1)

where G(x) is a universal function. The construction is clear:
k−α takes care of the power law decreases and the scaled vari-
able k/nβ aligns all curves together. This exercise is carried
out in Fig. 9 for the case r = 49. The procedure is inspired by
Ref. [46] and is called quite appropriately data collapse.

Although, we have not investigated the exact form of G(x),
its general behavior is characteristic of a number of self-
organized critical systems observed thus far (Ref. [46]): A
ﬂat curve sharply rising to a well deﬁned maximum followed
by a rapid exponential decrease as a function of the rescaled
variable. The scaling information is captured by the exponents
α and β. They can be extracted numerically from the positions
kb(n; r) of the maxima of the bulges of the individual proba-
bility distributions, together with the values of the probabilities
pkb at these maxima [see Fig. 9(a)], and the scaling Ansatz
of Eq. (A1). The search for the best scaling exponents α(r)
and β(r) is done separately under the assumption that they
are independent. This is coherent with our scaling Ansatz.
In practice, one obtains α(r) from the asymptotic slope of
the distributions (i.e., the initial dependence on k before the
peloton), and β(r) from a power law ﬁt nβ(r) to kb(n; r) ver-
sus n. Our initial ﬁndings, based only on two values of r,
reveal that the exponents have only a mild dependence on r
and in particular that β seems to be close to 0.3. In view of
our small datasets, it is not expected that the numerical values
of (α, β) = (1.87, 0.285) used in Fig. 9 are the absolute best
scaling exponents. A complete analytical justiﬁcation of our
scaling Ansatz and a derivation of the expected values of the
exponents are still lacking. However, the mere existence of a
scaling behavior provides useful estimates of how the degrees
of the leaders scale with network size. This is a crucial infor-
mation when one is interested in the statistics of the extremes,
both in theory [47] and application [48]. This calls for a more
extensive study beyond the scope of the present contribution.
