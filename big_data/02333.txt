In this paper we discuss the adiabatic projection method, a general framework for
scattering and reaction calculations on the lattice. We also introduce several new
techniques developed to study nucleus-nucleus scattering and reactions on the lattice.
We present technical details of the methods for large-scale problems. To estimate
the systematic errors of the calculations we consider simple two-particle scattering
on the lattice. Then we benchmark the accuracy and eﬃciency of the numerical
methods by applying these to calculate fermion-dimer scattering in lattice eﬀective
ﬁeld theory with and without a long-range Coulomb potential. The fermion-dimer
calculations correspond to neutron-deuteron and proton-deuteron scattering in the
spin-quartet channel at leading order in pionless eﬀective ﬁeld theory.

INTRODUCTION

2

One of the major challenges in computational strong interaction physics is the ab initio
calculation of nucleus-nucleus scattering and reactions. In the last decade there has been sig-
niﬁcant progress on nucleon-nucleus [1–6] and nucleus-nucleus [7–9] scattering and reactions.
Recently the scattering of two 4He (alpha) clusters has been achieved on the lattice using
the adiabatic projection method, and so far the 4He nuclei has been the heaviest projectile
used in the ab initio calculations of scattering and reactions [9]. This was an important step
towards making the ab initio description of scattering and reactions involving heavier nuclei
practical. It also opens the doors towards using experimental data from collisions of heavier
nuclei as input to improve ab initio nuclear structure theory. See Ref. [10] for a recent study
that uses the 4He -4He scattering as a tool for probing the nuclear structure of alpha-like
nuclei which are nuclei with equal and even numbers of protons and neutrons.

The adiabatic projection method is a general framework for scattering and reaction cal-
culations on the lattice, and the method splits the calculation into two parts [11–13]. In
the ﬁrst part, the method starts from the microscopic Hamiltonian and uses initial clus-
ter states and Euclidean time projection to construct a low-energy eﬀective theory for the
clusters, the so-called adiabatic Hamiltonian. The descriptions of the low-lying two-cluster
states from the adiabatic Hamiltonian become exact in the limit of large Euclidean projec-
tion time. In the second part of the method, the adiabatic Hamiltonian that describes the
low-energy interaction is used to calculate elastic and inelastic reactions such as a(b, b)a,
a(b, c)d and a(b, γ)c, where a, b, c are nuclear clusters and γ is a photon. Elastic neutron-
deuteron scattering d(n, n)d has been calculated accurately in Refs. [11–13]. The adiabatic
projection method in the presence of long range Coulomb in alpha-like nuclei was considered
in Refs. [9, 10] that would allow future studies involving nuclear clusters that necessarily
involve the Coulomb repulsion. The lattice method for calculating nuclear reactions from an
eﬀective two-cluster Hamiltonian with an external electro-weak current in radiative neutron
capture p(n, γ)d and proton-proton fusion p(p, e+νe)d were also considered [14, 15].

In this paper, we present technical details of the method and introduce several new
techniques that improve the accuracy and eﬃciency of the adiabatic projection method. We
also discuss the systematic errors in the scattering and reaction calculations arising from
the techniques developed here.

We organize our paper as follows. We start with the continuum and lattice formulations in
Section II. Then, in Section III we discuss the adiabatic projection formulation and describe
the implementation of several new methods useful for adiabatic projection calculations.
Section IV is dedicated to the discussion of the method used to extract the phase shifts
from the lattice. In Section V we implement the adiabatic projection formalism using new
improved methods for two-particle scattering on the lattice and study the systematic errors of
the calculations. Then in Section VI we consider fermion-dimer scattering to benchmark the
adiabatic projection formalism against continuum calculations for fermion-dimer scattering.
The dimer is a two-particle bound state in these calculations. Finally, the results of our
paper are summarized in Section VII.

In the lattice calculation, we take the particles to be spin- 1
2 fermions that form a s-wave
spin-singlet bound state identiﬁed as the dimer. At low-energy three-particle and higher-
body potentials are not needed. The low-energy physics can be described in the eﬀective
ﬁeld theory (EFT) with just short-ranged interaction between the fermions at leading order,
the so called pionless EFT [16, 17]. In this theory the spin indices can be identiﬁed with
the isospin indices of the nucleon-deuteron system in the spin quartet channel that we
study, as we explain further below. We study systems consisting of nucleons on the lattice
by discretizing space and time. We set the spatial lattice spacing to a = 1.97 fm and
the temporal lattice spacing is at = 1.32 fm. We deﬁne all physical quantities in lattice
units (l.u.) multiplying the quantities by the corresponding powers of a. Also, our lattice
is periodic in all spatial directions. The free nonrelativistic lattice Hamiltonian with the
O(a4)-improved action is

Since we discretize the temporal direction, we use the transfer matrix formalism and

details of the system.

III. ADIABATIC PROJECTION METHOD

4

(cid:88)

In this section we discuss the adiabatic projection method in detail and several new
techniques to eﬃciently and accurately extract scattering information from the lattice cal-
culations. To make our discussion general and complete, we consider two clusters consisting
of A1 and A2 nucleons, respectively. The adiabatic projection method is based on deﬁning
the initial cluster states of clusters 1 and 2 on the lattice and evolving these initial cluster
states in Euclidean time. The physical motivation is that we start with an approximate
description of two cluster states, and then we use the microscopic interaction to evolve these
states to the true low-lying cluster states in the presence of interaction. This has the advan-
tage that the cluster states include all the deformation and polarization of the clusters due
to the microscopic interaction, by design. We deﬁne the Slater-determinant initial cluster
states as,

|(cid:126)d (cid:105) =

|(cid:126)n + (cid:126)d (cid:105)1 ⊗ |(cid:126)n(cid:105)2 ,

(3.1)

(cid:126)n

where the states are parameterized by the two-cluster displacement vector (cid:126)d. Fig. 1 is
a schematic view of initial cluster state in two dimensions for two clusters separated by
displacement vector (cid:126)d. To improve the eﬃciency of the calculations, following Ref. [9], we

FIG. 1: A two-dimensional picture of the two-cluster initial state |(cid:126)d (cid:105) separated by dis-
placement vector (cid:126)d.

project the initial states onto spherical harmonics1 Y(cid:96),(cid:96)z with angular momentum quantum
numbers (cid:96), (cid:96)z,

|d(cid:105)(cid:96),(cid:96)z =

Y(cid:96),(cid:96)z ( ˆd (cid:48))δd,| (cid:126)d (cid:48)| |(cid:126)d (cid:48)(cid:105) .

(3.2)

(cid:88)

(cid:126)d(cid:48)

1 This can be viewed as deﬁning the cluster states in radial coordinates. To do so we bin the (cid:104)nˆx, nˆy, nˆz(cid:105)
lattice points with the same distance | (cid:126)d| by weighting them with spherical harmonics Y(cid:96),(cid:96)z ( ˆd).

𝑑  As we will discuss later, the systematic errors due to this projection are very small. This
method was recently used in Ref. [18] for scattering of two spin- 1
2 particles with total spin 1
on the lattice, and the scattering phase shifts and partial wave mixing angles were computed
with high precision.

FIG. 2: A two-dimensional picture of the lattice and the radial bin size aR in the radial
direction.

To make the calculations more eﬃcient, we ﬁnd it convenient to deﬁne a radial bin size,
aR, in the radial direction and group together lattice points within the bin size aR in radial
distance as shown in Fig. 2. As a result, we have grouped the lattice points into radial rings
of width aR. We now deﬁne R as radial distance to the midpoint of the corresponding ring.
Therefore, the initial cluster states are now

|R(cid:105)(cid:96),(cid:96)z =

|d(cid:105)(cid:96),(cid:96)z .

(3.3)

(cid:88)

|d−R|<aR/2

The methods introduced here provide signiﬁcant improvements in the calculations with
the adiabatic projection method and make the large scale calculations with Monte Carlo
much more practical. The systematic errors due to redeﬁning the radial coordinates have
been analyzed by considering a two-particle system, and we have found that they are nu-
merically very small. The two-particle scattering and the systematic errors are discussed
in Section V. These methods have been recently used in the alpha-alpha scattering phase
shift calculations [10].
In Section VI, we apply the methods described here to the three
nucleon system to calculate the eﬀective two-cluster interactions between neutron-deuteron
(n-d) and proton-deuteron (p-d) in the spin quartet channel.

These initial cluster states satisfy the following completeness relation,

The radial transfer matrix given by Eq. (3.8) already encodes the low-energy physics of the
two-cluster system (A1-body + A2-body system). However, due to the fact that the dressed
cluster states are not orthogonal, it is necessary to construct the norm matrix given by
Eqs. (3.7). Therefore, we deﬁne the radial adiabatic transfer matrix as,

Ref. [13] extensively discussed the adiabatic matrix in the asymptotic region where the
two clusters are well-separated, and it was rigorously proven that in the asymptotic region
where the amount of overlap between the cluster wave packets is negligible, the adiabatic
transfer matrix corresponds to an eﬀective transfer matrix M eﬀ that is simply a free (trivial)
transfer matrix for two clusters along with any long-range interactions between the clusters.
The important consequence of this is that the Euclidean time dependence of the adiabatic
transfer matrix drops out in the asymptotic region, and Eq. (3.9) reads

where R or R(cid:48) corresponds to the indices with distances larger than the short-range inter-
action scale.

In Fig. 3 we show the absolute diﬀerence between the interacting two-cluster adiabatic
transfer matrix and the trivial two-cluster adiabatic transfer matrix for fermion-dimer sys-
tem. The fermion-dimer system will be discussed in Section VI. Here we point out that at
distances less than 6 fm we see the eﬀects of the shallow deuteron bound state. The bound
state deuteron wave function is characterized by a length scale 1/κ where the binding mo-
mentum κ ≈ 45.7 MeV. At distances larger than 1/κ the absolute diﬀerence approaches
zero as expected by Eq. (3.10). This is an important result. It allows us to construct a
two-cluster Hamiltonian in a periodic box that is only slightly larger than the range of the
interaction. Then using Eq. (3.10) we can embed the lattice Hamiltonian in a much larger
box that describes trivial evolution of the two clusters which is not as computationally de-
manding. It is important to be able to describe the interaction in the asymptotic region

the magnitude of the absolute diﬀerence is equal to %18 of the corresponding value of the
trivial radial adiabatic transfer matrix for the lattice site where the absolute diﬀerence is
maximum. The physical distances for indices R, R(cid:48) = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 are 2.22, 3.20,
4.68, 6.16, 7.14, and 8.62 fm, respectively.

especially in the presence of the long-range Coulomb forces to meaningfully deﬁne a cross
section.

The calculation of the two-cluster Hamiltonian is divided into two parts to take advantage
of the result from Fig. 3. First, we compute the radial adiabatic transfer matrix given by
Eq. (3.9) for the A1-body + A2-body system. Due to the computational demand associated
with A1+A2 active nucleons, this is done on a periodic lattice with volume L (cid:48)3×Lt whose size
is larger than the range of the interaction but not too large. Subsequently, we also compute
the transfer matrices for individual clusters 1 and 2 on periodic cubic lattices where all
interactions between A1 nucleons in the cluster 1 and between A2 nucleons in the cluster 2
are turned on. However, the inter-cluster interaction is turned oﬀ. This second calculation
is done in a large periodic lattice with volume L3 × Lt where L (cid:29) L(cid:48). This calculation that
describes trivial two-cluster radial adiabatic transfer matrix of non-interacting clusters 1 and
2 along with any long-range Coulomb interactions become exact in the asymptotic region,
Eq. (3.10). As a corollary, we connect the interacting radial adiabatic transfer matrix with
the trivial radial adiabatic transfer matrix in the asymptotic region to extend the interacting
radial transfer matrix to the volume L3 × Lt. This procedure is illustrated in Fig. 4. The
periodic boundary of the L (cid:48)3 volume must be treated with care to avoid systematic errors.
R,R(cid:48) with R, R (cid:48) < L (cid:48)/2. As shown in Fig. 3, in
We only use the matrix elements of [M a
the asymptotic region the absolute diﬀerence | [M a
R,R(cid:48) | is very small, and the
systematic errors due to extension of the interacting radial transfer matrix are under control.
Before ending this section, in Table I we show how the dimensions of the adiabatic
transfer matrix scales after projection onto spherical harmonics and grouping the lattice
points into radial rings of width aR. The numbers indicated here are valid for any two-cluster
system, and they are independent of A1 and A2. Therefore, Table I clearly shows that the
new tools introduced in this section make the large scale calculations with Monte Carlo
much more practical and eﬃcient. Recently, the alpha-alpha scattering phase shifts have
successfully been computed from the radial adiabatic transfer matrix using this technique

IV. SCATTERING PHASE SHIFTS FROM A FINITE VOLUME

In the previous section, we constructed the adiabatic transfer matrix in radial coordinates,
and the improvement in the computational scaling is summarized in Table I. To extract the
scattering information from the adiabatic transfer matrix deﬁned in the radial coordinates,
we use the so-called spherical wall method [19, 20] which gives us access to the scattering
phase shift of the two-cluster system.

The spherical wall method imposes a hard boundary wall condition on the relative sepa-
ration between two clusters in ﬁnite box and removes the periodic boundary eﬀects inherited
from the cubic lattice. This eliminates artifacts due to the periodic boundary and allows
one to accurately compute scattering phase shifts at higher orbital angular momenta and
to study systems with the spin-orbital couplings [20]. Further, the spherical hard wall is a
general method to extract the phase shifts in the presence of a long-range interaction and
at energies above the inelastic threshold. These are important considerations for lattice
calculations. For example, there is no non-perturbative treatment of the Coulomb force in
L¨uscher’s method [36, 37] but this is easily done in using the spherical wall formulation.
Fig. 5(a) is a schematic view of a spherical wall at radius r = Rw in two dimensions. Solving
the Schr¨odinger equation for the radial adiabatic transfer matrix of the two-cluster system
with the imposed spherical hard wall, we obtain the spherical scattering waves which vanish
at Rw + εR, where εR is the correction on the precise radius of the spherical wall due to the
discrete lattice, and it is less than a half of the lattice spacing, |εR| < a/2. In Fig. 5(b) we
show an example of the spherical scattering lattice wave functions for trivial and interacting
fermion-dimer systems.

ﬁrst (second) kind, and F(cid:96) (G(cid:96)) is the regular (irregular) Coulomb wave function [21, 22].
Since our lattice wave functions emerge from the solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation for
the radial transfer matrix projected onto spherical harmonics with the angular momentum
quantum numbers (cid:96) and (cid:96)z, we can extract the scattering phase shifts by ﬁtting Eq. (4.2)
to the lattice wave functions. However, as we explain in the following, we ﬁnd that working
with the spectrum of the radial adiabatic transfer matrix and the trivial radial transfer
matrix is more eﬃcient and accurate than the wave function ﬁtting procedure.

The spectrum of the trivial radial adiabatic transfer matrix provides crucial information
to calculate the correction εR to the radius of the spherical hard wall. For this case the
system has zero phase shift and the wave function vanishes at R (cid:48)

In Fig. 6 we show the lattice and
continuum dispersion relations for a two-cluster system consisting of a fermion and dimer
at two diﬀerent Euclidean times.

The energy of the spectrum in Eq.(4.4) is calculated from the lattice using the eigenvalues
λn(Lt) of any transfer matrix is related to the energy estimate at Lt time steps which is given
by

En(Lt) = −log [λn(Lt)]

αt

.

The energy En is computed by extrapolation to the limit Lt → ∞ using the ansatz,

En(Lt) = En + cn(E) e−Ltαt ∆En .

(4.5)

(4.6)

This ansatz is valid when the splittings from the excited states are large. We discuss the
general case in Appendix A. We can also do a similar inﬁnite time extrapolation of the
two-cluster scattering phase shift calculated from E(Lt) in Eq. (4.3) using a similar anzatz:

δ(cid:96)[p(Lt)] = δ(cid:96)(p) + c(cid:96)(p) e−Ltαt ∆E(cid:96) .

(4.7)

For a detailed discussion of Eq. (4.7) see Appendix A. The extrapolations in Eqs. (4.6) and
(4.7) eliminate the contributions from excited states. We have found that the ﬁnal results
for the scattering phase shifts are independent of which extrapolation is adopted in the
analysis. However, since the phase shift extrapolation is more eﬃcient, the ﬁnal results for
the scattering phase shifts in this work are obtained by extrapolating the phase shifts.

V. TWO-PARTICLE SCATTERING ON THE LATTICE

In this section, we analyze and discuss the systematic errors due to the methods in-
troduced Section III for the calculations of the adiabatic transfer matrix. To check the
systematic errors arising from the projection onto spherical harmonics and the radial bin
size aR, we ﬁrst consider a simple system of two spin- 1
2 particles with total spin 0 on a peri-
odic cubic lattice. Here we use the adiabatic projection formalism with Lt = 1 to also check
errors associated with extending the volume from L (cid:48)3 to L3. We perform the calculations
with lattice volumes L(cid:48)3 = (16 l.u.)3 and L3 = (62 l.u.)3.

We consider an attractive Gaussian potential between the particles,

where the interaction strength cg and the range of the potential Rg are set to −8.0 MeV and

FIG. 7: Plots of the two-particle scattering phase shifts for the partial waves with (cid:96) ≤ 4

between particles is an attractive Gaussian potential. The scattering phase shifts are com-
puted from the radial adiabatic transfer matrices for Lt = 1 and with aR= 0.010, 0.125, and
0.250 in lattice units (l.u.), and projected onto spherical harmonics with (cid:96) ≤ 4 and (cid:96)z = 0.

the scattering phase shifts, projecting onto spherical harmonics as given in Eq. (3.2) and
grouping the lattice points within the width aR introduce very small errors, at most a couple
percent of relative error in the phase shift.

VI. NEUTRON-DEUTERON AND PROTON-DEUTERON SCATTERING

In this section we consider fermion-dimer system consisting of two-component fermions.
We denote the two components as ↑ (spin up) and ↓ (spin down). The fermion-dimer system
is the simplest nontrivial two-cluster problem one can study. We use it to test the methods

developed and discussed in Sections III and IV. There are several reasons that make the
fermion-dimer system attractive for a benchmark lattice calculation. At low energy this
system can be described by an EFT with zero-range two-fermion interaction, and yet still
have a very shallow dimer characterized by a large extended deuteron wave function. Thus
on one hand, the lattice short-ranged interaction is simple to implement and on the other
hand there is a ﬁnite length scale associated with the dimer over which we can test the
lattice method of matching the fully interacting A1 + A2 adiabatic calculation to the A1
and A2 trivial adiabatic calculation as described in Section III, see Fig. 4. Moreover, the
continuum EFT calculation in this theory with and without Coulomb interaction is easily
available [16, 24–28]. This allows a direct comparison of the lattice data with the continuum
calculations that both use the same low-energy theory with the same number of physics
input — in this case the deuteron binding energy.

The fermion-dimer problem can be related to nucleon-deuteron scattering in the spin-
quartet channel. In the quartet channel when one considers the situation with all the spins
aligned along the quantization axis, the isospin label that distinguishes a proton from a
neutron can be identiﬁed with the spin up ↑ and and down ↓ label of the fermion-dimer sys-
tem, as the nucleon spin label becomes redundant. Thus quartet channel neutron-deuteron
scattering is identiﬁed with ↓-dimer scattering, and proton-deuteron scattering with ↑-dimer
scattering. The dimer is a bound state of ↑ and ↓ fermion.

For simplicity, we set the mass of two-component fermions to be equal, m↑ = m↓ = m,
and m = 939 MeV. With the zero-range interactions between two-component fermions, the
potential is written in the following form,

(cid:88)

ρ↑((cid:126)n)ρ↑((cid:126)n)

(6.1)

where C0 is the lattice-regularized short-range interaction coeﬃcient to be determined,
αEM = e2/4π = 1/137.036 is the ﬁne-structure constant, Z↑ is the charge of ↑ component
fermion. The Coulomb part of the potential does not require any special treatment at |(cid:126)n| =
0 because of the Pauli exclusion between ↑ particles. For the general case see Ref. [15, 23].
In our three-body system one ↑ and one ↓ fermions are bound together and make a dimer
state. We tune the short-range interaction coeﬃcient C0 such that the dimer bound state
energy is set to −2.2246 MeV. This corresponds to a deuteron breakup momentum of about
52.8 MeV above which the adiabatic Hamiltonian for two clusters is not appropriate as the
three-body breakup channels become available. However, the continuum EFT calculations
show that the imaginary part of the phase shifts remain quite small even above the breakup
momentum. Thus we ﬁnd that the lattice phase shift calculations using the two-cluster
approximation continues to compare well with the continuum EFT calculation that treat
the three-body problem exactly using a Faddeev equation.

The microscopic transfer matrix operator for fermion-dimer system becomes,

We compare our lattice results of the S-wave scattering phase shifts to the elastic scatter-
ing phase shift calculations in the continuum and inﬁnite-volume limits at leading order in
pionless eﬀective ﬁeld theory [16, 24–28]. We emphasize again that we compare the LO lattice
EFT data to the same LO continuum EFT results for nucleon-deuteron scattering. Exper-
imental data for this exists [29–31]. So, does higher order EFT calculations and potential
model calculations that describe experimental data well, for example Refs. [25, 27, 28, 32, 33]
and references there in. However, it is more meaningful to compare the same LO EFT lattice
and continuum calculation for benchmarking the accuracy of the numerical methods.

For nucleon-deuteron scattering we compare our lattice calculations of the P -wave phase
shifts to the elastic scattering phase shift calculations in the continuum and inﬁnite-volume
limits at leading order in pionless eﬀective ﬁeld theory. In Fig. 17, we show the P -wave phase
shifts for neutron-deuteron and proton-deuteron scattering in the spin quartet channel. The
blue circles are the lattice results that we compare with the corresponding results from EFT
in the continuum and inﬁnite volume limits shown as the dashed line [16, 24, 26, 27, 39].
Similarly, the red squares compare the lattice results for proton-deuteron scattering with the
corresponding EFT calculations in the continuum and inﬁnite volume limits represented by
the solid line [25, 28, 38]. We ﬁnd good agreement between the lattice and continuum results
for neutron-deuteron and proton-deuteron scattering. The deviation with the continuum
results at larger momenta is due to nonzero lattice spacing eﬀects (observed in previous

VII. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper we have presented several new methods for studying two-cluster scattering
on the lattice using the adiabatic projection method. As extensively discussed in earlier
pioneering works [11–13], the adiabatic projection method is a general framework for study-
ing scattering and reactions of clusters on the lattice. The method uses the initial cluster
states and the Euclidean time projection to construct a low energy eﬀective theory for the
participating clusters, and in the large Euclidean projection time limit the method gives
the exact descriptions of the low-lying states for two clusters. In this study we use a new
method which parametrizes the initial cluster states in spherical coordinates by projecting
the initial cluster states onto spherical harmonics. Furthermore, we have also introduced
a radial bin size aR, and we have binned the initial cluster states by grouping the lattice
points with radial distance a given band of width aR.

We found that the new methods provide crucial improvements in the eﬃciency of the
two-cluster adiabatic transfer matrix calculations without introducing additional systematic
errors into the calculations. The improvements were summarized in Table I in terms of the
dimensions of the adiabatic transfer matrix for two-cluster systems. In order to check the
systematic errors due to projecting the initial cluster states onto spherical harmonics and
deﬁning the radial bin size aR, we benchmarked these methods using two-particle scattering
on the lattice. We found that the corresponding systematic errors are numerically very
small, at most a couple percent of relative error in the phase shift.

We employed the new methods discussed in this paper to study a two-cluster system using
the adiabatic projection method. We considered fermion-dimer scattering with and without
a long-range Coulomb potential, which correspond to proton-deuteron and neutron-deuteron
scattering in the spin-quartet channel, respectively. For the analyses of the scattering phase
shifts we used the spherical wall method. We computed the S-wave and P -wave phase
shifts for neutron-deuteron and proton-deuteron scattering in the spin-quartet channel, and
we compared our results to the available calculations for the corresponding systems in the
continuum and the inﬁnite volume limits. We found that our lattice results are in good
agreements with the continuum calculations.

The methods that we have presented in this paper are developed and designed to improve
the eﬃciency of large-scale calculations of nucleus-nucleus scattering and reactions using
Monte Carlo. Recently, these methods are employed in the calculation of the S-wave alpha-
alpha scattering phase shifts using the adiabatic projection and the calculations are greatly
improved [9, 10].

Appendix A: Extrapolation

23

We discuss the Euclidean time extrapolations to eliminate the contaminations from ex-
cited states to the energy and the scattering phase shifts. Let us consider Euclidean time
projection with a single initial cluster state with a nonzero overlap with the ground state,

(cid:88)

|ψ(cid:105) =

ci |φi(cid:105) ,

where |φi(cid:105) are the energy eigenstates with energies Ei in order of increasing energy

i

E0 ≤ E1 ≤ E2 . . .

The energy estimate at Lt Euclidean time step is

or explicitly [34, 35],

(cid:34)

log

(cid:20)(cid:80)

Eq. (A4) can be rewritten in terms of the ground state energy and the contributions from
the excited states as,

E(Lt) = E0 +

(A5)

Then in the large Euclidean time limit and using the fact that Ei− E0 (cid:28) α−1
excitations, Eq. (A5) can be further simpliﬁed to

t

for low-energy

E(Lt) ∼= E0 +

Now we want to ﬁnd an expression for the scattering phase shift extrapolation. Let us
write the scattering phase shift estimate at Lt time steps starting from the eﬀective range
expansion,

(cid:20)

(cid:18)

δ(cid:96)[p(Lt)] = cot−1

(A7)

where a(cid:96) and r(cid:96) are the scattering parameters at the two lowest order of the expansion. p(Lt)
is the momentum estimate at Lt time steps and deﬁned in terms of the energy estimate at
Lt time step given in Eq. (A6),

p(Lt) =(cid:112)2µ E(Lt) =(cid:112)p2 + A(Lt)

(A8)

(cid:35)

(cid:19)(cid:21)

where p is the momentum in the large Lt limit and A(Lt) is the residual correction at Lt,

A(Lt) ∼=

(A9)

Now we insert Eq. (A8) into Eq. (A7), then after some manipulations, we obtain the following
expression for the scattering phase shift estimate at Lt time steps,

δ(cid:96)[p(Lt)] = δ(cid:96)(p) + c(cid:96)

A(Lt)

p2 + O(A(Lt)2) ,

(A10)

where c(cid:96) absorbs the contaminations from the scattering phase shifts for excited states. For
the system where the splittings from excited states are large, this expression can be further
simpliﬁed to Eq. (4.7).
