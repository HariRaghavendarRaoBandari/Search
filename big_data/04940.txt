AN INDEFINITE CONCAVE-CONVEX EQUATION UNDER A

NEUMANN BOUNDARY CONDITION I

HUMBERTO RAMOS QUOIRIN AND KENICHIRO UMEZU

Abstract. We investigate the problem

(Pλ)

−∆u = λb(x)|u|q−2u + a(x)|u|p−2u in Ω,

∂u

∂n

= 0 on ∂Ω,

where Ω is a bounded smooth domain in IRN (N ≥ 2), 1 < q < 2 < p, λ ∈ IR, and
a, b ∈ C α(Ω) with 0 < α < 1. Under some indeﬁnite type conditions on a and b we prove
the existence of two nontrivial non-negative solutions for |λ| small. We characterize then
the asymptotic proﬁles of these solutions as λ → 0, which implies in some cases the
positivity and ordering of these solutions. In addition, this asymptotic analysis suggests
the existence of a loop type subcontinuum in the non-negative solutions set. We prove in
some cases the existence of such subcontinuum via a bifurcation and topological analysis
of a regularized version of (Pλ).

1. Introduction and statements of main results

Let Ω be a bounded domain of IRN (N ≥ 2) with smooth boundary ∂Ω. This article
is concerned with existence, non-existence, and multiplicity of non-negative solutions for the
problem

(Pλ)

where

(−∆u = λb(x)|u|q−2u + a(x)|u|p−2u in Ω,

∂u
∂n = 0

on ∂Ω,

∂2
∂x2
j

is the usual Laplacian in IRN ,

• ∆ =PN

j=1

• λ ∈ IR,
• 1 < q < 2 < p < ∞,
• a, b ∈ C α(Ω) with α ∈ (0, 1),
• n is the unit outer normal to the boundary ∂Ω.

By a solution of (Pλ) we mean a classical solution of (Pλ). A solution u of (Pλ) is
said to be nontrivial and non-negative if it satisﬁes u ≥ 0 on Ω and u 6≡ 0, whereas it is said
to be positive if it satisﬁes u > 0 on Ω.

If λ > 0 and a, b are positive on some non-empty open subset of Ω then fλ(x, s) =
λb(x)|s|q−2s + a(x)|s|p−2s belongs to the class of concave-convex type nonlinearities. Since
the work of Ambrosetti, Brezis and Cerami [3], this class of problems has been widely inves-
tigated, mostly for Dirichlet boundary conditions. In [3] the authors proved the existence
of Λ > 0 such that the problem

(−∆u = λ|u|q−2u + |u|p−2u in Ω,

u = 0

on ∂Ω,

has a minimal positive solution uλ for 0 < λ < Λ, at least one positive weak solution for
λ = Λ, and no positive solution for λ > Λ [3, Theorem 2.1]. Moreover, if p ≤ 2N
N −2 when
N ≥ 3 then (1.1) has a second positive solution vλ > uλ for λ < Λ [3, Theorem 2.3]. It
was also proved that uλ is the only positive solution of (1.1) which converges to 0 in C(Ω)
as λ → 0+ [3, Theorem 2.2]. Most of the previous results were extended by De Figueiredo,
Gossez, and Ubilla [14] to a larger class of concave-convex type problems, whose prototype
is the analogue of (Pλ) for Dirichlet boundary conditions, i.e.

(−∆u = λb(x)|u|q−2u + a(x)|u|p−2u in Ω,

u = 0

on ∂Ω.

(1.2)

Here b ≥ 0, b 6≡ 0 and a may change sign. For other works dealing with non-negative
solutions of indeﬁnite concave-convex problems under Dirichlet boundary conditions we
refer to [12, 23, 28].

Several diﬀerences between (Pλ) and (1.2) may be observed. The most evident one
arises in the deﬁnite case a, b ≥ 0, with a, b 6≡ 0. It is known from [13, 14] that in this case
(1.2) has a nontrivial non-negative solution for some λ > 0. This result no longer holds for
(Pλ). As a matter of fact, if u is a non-negative solution of (Pλ) then a simple integration
provides

so that u ≡ 0 if λ > 0.

ZΩ(cid:0)λb(x)uq−1 + a(x)up−1(cid:1) = 0,

The ﬁrst purpose of this work is to obtain conditions on a and b which guarantee
the existence of a nontrivial non-negative solution of (Pλ) for some λ > 0. In particular,
we shall obtain two nontrivial non-negative solutions u1,λ, u2,λ for λ > 0 suﬃciently small.
At this point further diﬀerences between (Pλ) and (1.2) may be pointed out. Unlike [3,
Theorem 2.2], we shall see that in some cases we have u1,λ, u2,λ → 0 in C(Ω) as λ → 0+
(see Theorem 1.1). Furthermore, in contrast with [3, 14], the second solution u2,λ may be
obtained without the condition p ≤ 2N

N −2 when N ≥ 3 (see Remark 1.2).

To the best of our knowledge, very few works have been devoted to concave-convex
problems under Neumann boundary conditions. Tarfulea [26] considered (Pλ) in the case

b ≡ 1, proving that RΩ a < 0 is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence of

a positive solution. Making use of the sub-supersolutions method, the author proved the
existence of Λ > 0 such that problem (Pλ) has at least one positive solution for λ < Λ which
converges to 0 in L∞(Ω) as λ → 0+, and no positive solution for λ > Λ.

Garcia-Azorero, Peral, and Rossi [15] dealt with the problem

(−∆u + u = |u|p−2u in Ω,

∂n = λ|u|q−2u

∂u

on ∂Ω.

(1.3)

By means of a variational approach, they proved that if 1 < q < 2 and p = 2N
N −2 when N > 2
then there exists Λ1 > 0 such that (1.3) has at least two positive solutions for λ < Λ1, at
least one positive solution for λ = Λ1, and no positive solution for λ > Λ1.

In [1], Alama investigated the problem

(−∆u = µu + b(x)uq−1 + γup−1

∂u
∂n = 0

in Ω,
on ∂Ω,

(1.4)

where µ ∈ IR and γ > 0. Note that when µ = 0 this problem can be reduced to (Pλ) by
a suitable rescaling. A special diﬃculty in this problem is the possible existence of dead
core solutions when b changes sign. Using variational, bifurcation, and sub-supersolutions

AN INDEFINITE CONCAVE-CONVEX EQUATION UNDER A NEUMANN BOUNDARY CONDITION 3

techniques, the author proved existence, non-existence and multiplicity results for non-
negative solutions in accordance with γ and µ. Moreover, these solutions are shown to be
positive in the set where b > 0. However, the author did not discuss the structure of the
non-negative solutions set when µ = 0.

The second and main purpose of this article is to investigate the existence of a sub-
continuum of non-negative solutions of (Pλ). Some works have been devoted to this issue
in the context of concave-convex nonlinearities. In [18], Korman proved that if Ω is a ball
in IRN then there exists λ0 > 0 such that the problem

(−∆u = λ(cid:0)|u|p−2u + |u|q−2u(cid:1)

u = 0

in Ω,
on ∂Ω,

(1.5)

has exactly two positive solutions for λ < λ0, one positive solution for λ = λ0 and no
positive solution for λ > λ0. In addition, he proved that for λ ≤ λ0 the positive solutions
lie on a single smooth solution curve and described the behavior of this curve with respect
to λ. In [19] he extended these results to a problem with a non-autonomous concave-convex
nonlinearity. Delgado and Su´arez [12] considered the problem

(Lu = λ|u|q−2u + a(x)|u|p−2u in Ω,

u = 0

on ∂Ω,

(1.6)

where L is a second order uniformly elliptic operator not necessarily self-adjoint and a
changes sign. They proved the existence of a unbounded subcontinuum of non-negative
solutions emanating supercritically from (λ, u) = (0, 0). To the best of our knowledge, no
results on the existence of a subcontinuum of non-negative solutions for (Pλ) are known
when b changes sign.

Based on the asymptotic analysis of u1,λ, u2,λ as λ → 0+, we shall prove in some
cases the existence of a loop type subcontinuum (see Theorem 1.6) in the non-negative
solutions set of (Pλ). This kind of continuum has been investigated by L´opez-G´omez and
Molina-Meyer in [21] and Brown in [6] for problems involving nonlinearities that are C1 at
u = 0, which is not the case for (Pλ). For that same reason, the standard global bifurcation
theory proposed by Rabinowitz [24] (see also L´opez-G´omez [20]) does not apply to (Pλ) in a
straightforward way. We shall overcome this diﬃculty using a regularization procedure that
will be described later. Several works have made a direct use of the global bifurcation theory.
We refer to Hess and Kato [17] for a problem with a non self-adjoint operator, to Blat and
Brown [5] for a class of nonlinear elliptic systems, to L´opez-G´omez and Molina-Meyer [21]
for a study of isolas or compact solution components, to Cantrell and Cosner [9] for diﬀusive
logistic equations from Mathematical Biology, and to Umezu [27] and Cano-Casanova [8]
for nonlinear boundary conditions.

Note that if b ≥ 0 then, by the strong maximum principle and the boundary point
lemma, nontrivial non-negative solutions of (Pλ) are positive solutions. On the other hand,
it is known that if b− 6≡ 0 then dead core solutions may arise [4], which makes delicate
the study of the non-negative solutions set of (Pλ), as shown in [1]. For instance, when
b changes sign the existence of a minimal non-negative solution for λ > 0 small is still
unknown. Furthermore, when a ≥ 0 and b changes sign, it is not known whether the

λ > 0.

condition RΩ b ≥ 0 provides non-existence of nontrivial non-negative solutions of (Pλ) for

In our existence results we shall also be concerned with stability properties of positive
solutions of (Pλ). Let us recall that a positive solution u of (Pλ) is said to be asymptotically
stable (respect. unstable) if γ1(λ, u) > 0 (respect. < 0), where γ1(λ, u) is the ﬁrst eigenvalue

In addition, u is said to be weakly stable if γ1(λ, u) ≥ 0.

subsequence, u2,λn → u2,0 in C2(Ω), where u2,0 is a positive solution of (1.11). In addition,

this result does not depend on the sign of RΩ b. As a consequence we may also infer the

existence of two nontrivial non-negative solutions v1,λ and v2,λ for λ < 0 suﬃciently small.
These solutions satisfy v1,λ → 0 in C2(Ω) as λ → 0+, and if λn → 0+ then, up to a
subsequence, v2,λn → v2,0 in C2(Ω), where v2,0 is a positive solution of (1.11). One may
then ask if these solutions lie on a loop type subcontinuum of non-negative solutions of (Pλ).

HUMBERTO RAMOS QUOIRIN AND KENICHIRO UMEZU

We shall investigate this question by considering a regularized version of (Pλ), namely,

(Pλ,ǫ)

(−∆u = a(x)|u|p−2u + λ(b(x) − ǫ)|u + ǫ|q−2u in Ω,

∂u
∂n = 0

on ∂Ω,

where λ ∈ IR and ǫ > 0. We may then look at (Pλ) as the limit problem of (Pλ,ǫ) when
ǫ → 0+. This procedure has been already used in [25], where a regularized version of a
nonlinear boundary condition is studied. Note that the mapping t 7→ |t + ǫ|q−2t is analytic
at t = 0 and any nontrivial non-negative solution of (Pλ,ǫ) is positive on Ω. The unilateral
global bifurcation theorem by Rabinowitz [24, Theorem 1.27] (see also L´opez-G´omez [20,
Theorem 6.4.3]) may then be applied to (Pλ,ǫ). To this end we consider its linearized problem
at u = 0:

(−∆ϕ = λ(b − ǫ)ǫq−2ϕ in Ω,

∂ϕ
∂n = 0

on ∂Ω.

Under the condition

Ωb−ǫ

+ 6= ∅

and

b ≤ 0,

ZΩ

(1.13)

(1.14)

this problem has exactly two principal eigenvalues λ = 0 and λ = λǫ > 0, which are
both simple. We use the unilateral global bifurcation theory to obtain two subcontinua
C0 = C0(ǫ), C1 = C1(ǫ) of positive solutions of (Pλ,ǫ) bifurcating from (0, 0) and (λǫ, 0), re-
spectively. Moreover, we analyse the local nature of these subcontinua near the bifurcation
points (Theorem 5.1). We turn then to the study of the global nature of C0(ǫ), C1(ǫ) and
their limiting nature as ǫ → 0+. First we show that positive solutions (λ, u) of (Pλ,ǫ) are a
priori bounded in IR × C(Ω) if the following conditions are assumed, where we assume (H2)
following Amann and L´opez-G´omez [2]:

(H0) There exist balls B1, B2 such that B1, B2 ⊂ Ω, and

a ≥ 0, a 6≡ 0 and b > 0 on B1,

a ≥ 0, a 6≡ 0 and b < 0 on B2,

that

Based on these a priori bounds and the global properties of C0 and C1, we infer that
these subcontinua are both bounded, and consequently must coincide, i.e. C0 = C1 = C∗
(Theorem 6.7). Thus (Pλ,ǫ) has a bounded subcontinuum of positive solutions going from
(0, 0) to (λǫ, 0), see Figure 2. We consider then the limiting proﬁles of C0 and C1 as ǫ → 0+ by
means of Whyburn’s topological method [29]. Here a priori bounds from below for positive
solutions of (Pλ,ǫ) with λ = 0 (Lemma 6.8) and the fact that bifurcation from zero does not

AN INDEFINITE CONCAVE-CONVEX EQUATION UNDER A NEUMANN BOUNDARY CONDITION 7

occur for (Pλ) at any λ 6= 0 (Proposition 6.10) play an important role. The latter fact is
veriﬁed under the condition

(H3) Ωb

+ and Ωb

− are both subdomains of Ω.

Combining the previous results, we establish:

Theorem 1.6. Assume (1.12). If (H0), (H1), (H2) and (H3) are satisﬁed then (Pλ) has
a loop type subcontinuum (non-empty, closed and connected component) C of nontrivial
non-negative solutions bifurcating at (0, 0), which joins (0, 0) to itself. Moreover:

(1) C is non-trivial, i.e. C 6= {(0, 0)}.
(2) The only trivial solution contained in C is (λ, u) = (0, 0), i.e. C does not contain

any point (λ, 0) with λ 6= 0.

(3) There exists δ > 0 such that C does not contain any positive solution u of (1.11)

satisfying kukC(Ω) ≤ δ.

Figure 3 illustrates the subcontinuum provided by Theorems 1.6.

Remark 1.7. An example of (a, b) satisfying conditions (H0), (H1) and (H3) can be con-
structed as in Figure 1.

Finally, let us mention that our regularization procedure described above can also be
used to obtain subcontinua (non-necessarily of loop type) for a larger class of concave-convex
type problems. We shall treat this issue in a forthcoming article.

The outline of this article is the following:

in Section 2 we follow a variational ap-
proach based on the Nehari manifold method to prove Theorem 1.1. In Section 3 we use
the asymptotic proﬁle of u1,λ to obtain a nontrivial non-negative solution of (Pλ) for λ > 0
small via the sub-supersolutions method. We also show that bifurcation from zero does not
occur for (Pλ) at any λ > 0. Section 4 is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.4. In Section 5
we carry out a bifurcation analysis for the regularized problem (Pλ,ǫ). Finally, in Section 6
we prove Theorem 1.6.

1.1. Notation. Throughout this article we use the following notations and conventions:

• The inﬁmum of an empty set is assumed to be ∞.

• Unless otherwise stated, for any f ∈ L1(Ω) the integral RΩ f is considered with
respect to the Lebesgue measure, whereas for any g ∈ L1(∂Ω) the integral R∂Ω g is

considered with respect to the surface measure.

Throughout this section we assume that p < 2N

functional Iλ deﬁned on X by

Let us recall that X = H 1(Ω) is equipped with the usual norm kuk = (cid:2)RΩ(cid:0)|∇u|2 + u2(cid:1)(cid:3)

Critical points of Iλ are weak solutions of (Pλ), which are also classical solutions by standard
regularity. In the sequel we shall consider the following useful subsets of X:

E+ = {u ∈ X : E(u) > 0},
A± = {u ∈ X : A(u) ≷ 0}, A0 = {u ∈ X : A(u) = 0}, A±
B± = {u ∈ X : B(u) ≷ 0}, B0 = {u ∈ X : B(u) = 0}, B±

0 = A± ∪ A0.
0 = B± ∪ B0.

(1) Since un ⇀ u0 in X and E is weakly lower semicontinuous, we have

0 ≤ E(u0) ≤ lim inf E(un) ≤ 0.

Hence E(u0) = 0, which implies that u0 is a constant. Moreover E(un) → E(u0).
Since un → u0 in L2(Ω) we deduce that un → u0 in X.

The Nehari manifold associated to Iλ is given by

Nλ := {u ∈ X \ {0} : hI ′

λ is unstable. Indeed,

E(u) − (p − 1)A(u) − λ(q − 1)B(u) = (2 − q)E(u) − (p − q)A(u) < 0.

It follows that

To analyse the structure of N ±

moreover, t∗ is unique. If iu(t∗) > 0, then ju has a global maximum which is positive and
a local minimum which is negative. Moreover, these are the only critical points of ju.

We shall require a condition on λ that provides iu(t∗) > 0. Note that

Note that if E+ ∩ A+ ∩ B+ = ∅ then λ0 = ∞. We deduce then the following result, which
provides suﬃcient conditions for the existence of critical points of ju:

Proposition 2.3. Assume (1.8). Then λ0 > 0 and, for 0 < λ < λ0, there holds:

AN INDEFINITE CONCAVE-CONVEX EQUATION UNDER A NEUMANN BOUNDARY CONDITION 11

(1) If either u ∈ A+ ∩ B− or u ∈ E+ ∩ A+ ∩ B0 then, ju has a positive global maximum
u(t1) and ju(t) < ju(t1) for t 6= t1. Moreover, t1

u(t1) = 0 > j′′

at some t1 > 0, i.e. j′
is the unique critical point of ju.

(2) If either u ∈ A− ∩ B+ or E+ ∩ A0 ∩ B+ then ju has a negative global minimum at
u(t1) and ju(t) > ju(t1) for t 6= t1. Moreover, t1 is

u(t1) = 0 < j′′

some t1 > 0, i.e. j′
the unique critical point of ju.

(3) If u ∈ E+ ∩ A+ ∩ B+ then ju has a negative local minimum at t1 > 0 and a positive
global maximum at t2 > t1. Furthermore t1 and t2 are the only critical points of ju.

Proof. First, we show that λ0 > 0. Assume λ0 = 0, so that we can choose un ∈ E+∩A+∩B+
satisfying

E(un) → 0,

and C−1

p−2 = 1.

If (un) is bounded in X then we may assume that un ⇀ u0 for some u0 ∈ X and un → u0
in Lp(Ω) and Lq(Ω). It follows from Lemma 2.1(1) that u0 is a constant and un → u0 in
X. From un ∈ A+ ∩ B+ we deduce that u0 ∈ A+

0 . In addition, there holds

so that u0 6≡ 0. From Lemma 2.1 we get a contradiction.

Let us assume now that kunk → ∞. Set vn = un

assume that vn ⇀ v0 and vn → v0 in Lp(Ω). Since E(vn) → 0 and vn ∈ A+ ∩ B+, we have
vn → v0 in X, v0 is a constant, and v0 ∈ A+
0 . In particular, kv0k = 1, i.e. v0 6≡ 0.
Lemma 2.1 provides again a contradiction.

0 ∩ B+

Now, if u ∈ A+ ∩ B− or u ∈ E+ ∩ A+ ∩ B0 then it is clear that ju has a unique critical
point, which is a global maximum point. In a similar way, if u ∈ A− ∩ B+ then ju has a
unique critical point, which is a global minimum point. Finally, if u ∈ E+ ∩ A+ ∩ B+ then

Indeed, if u0 ∈ A0 then E(u0) = 0 i.e. u0 is a non-zero constant. Hence RΩ a = 0. By (1.8)

u2,0 is a positive ground state solution of (1.11). In this case u2,λ is a unstable
positive solution of (Pλ) for λ > 0 suﬃciently small.

Proof. Let λn → 0+. By Lemma 2.11, up to a subsequence, we have un = u2,λn ⇀ u0 in X
and un → u0 in Lp(Ω) and Lq(Ω). Since un is a solution of (Pλn ) it follows that un → u0
in C2(Ω) and u0 is a non-negative solution of (1.11). This problem has a nontrivial non-

negative solution if and only if RΩ a < 0. Hence u0 ≡ 0 if RΩ a ≥ 0.

Finally, let us show that u2,λ is positive on Ω for λ > 0 suﬃciently small. Indeed,
assume by contradiction that for every λ > 0 there exists 0 < µ < λ such that u2,µ
is non-negative but vanishes somewhere on Ω. Then we obtain a sequence µn → 0+
such that un = u2,µn are non-negative solutions vanishing somewhere on Ω. But
up to a subsequence, (un) converges in C2(Ω) to a positive function, which is a
contradiction. The proof is now complete.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.13.

(1) If Ωa

+ 6= ∅ and RΩ a < 0 < RΩ b then Propositions 2.10 and 2.12 provide us with

some λ∗ > 0 such that u2,λ > u1,λ for 0 < λ < λ∗. Indeed, assume on the contrary
that there are two sequences λn → 0+ and xn ∈ Ω such that u2,λn (xn) ≤ u1,λn (xn)
and u2,λn → u2,0 in C2(Ω). Let ǫ = minΩ u2,0
> 0. Since u1,λn → 0 in C2(Ω), there
exists n0 ∈ N such that maxΩ u1,λn < ǫ for n ≥ n0. It follows that u1,λn (xn) < ǫ
for n ≥ n0, and thus that u2,λn (xn) < ǫ for such n. However, since u2,λn → u2,0
in C2(Ω), there exists n1 ∈ N such that minΩ u2,λn > ǫ for n ≥ n1, which is a
contradiction. The same result holds if Ωb
can apply a similar argument to w1,λ = λ− 1
p−q u2,λ. We use
now the fact that w2,λ → c∗ in C2(Ω) as λ → 0+ and if λn → 0+ then, up to a
subsequence, w1,λn → 0 in C2(Ω).

+ 6= ∅ and RΩ a > 0 > RΩ b. Indeed, one

(2) One can show that ground state solutions of (1.11) converge to 0 in C2(Ω) as

RΩ a+

RΩ a ր 0. More precisely, let an = a+ − δna− where δn is a sequence such that
RΩ a− . Then an ր a0 = a+ − δ0a− and RΩ a0 = 0. We denote by

δn ց δ0 =
un a ground state solution of (1.11) with a = an. First we show that (un) is
bounded in X. If not, we set vn = un
kunk and assume that vn ⇀ v0 in X. We set
p An(u) for u ∈ X. In addition, we denote
by Nn the Nehari manifold associated to In. Let φ ∈ X be such that a−φ ≡ 0 and
a+φ 6≡ 0. Then

An(u) =RΩ an|u|p and In(u) = 1

E(un) = In(un) ≤ In(t0φ) = C(t0).

Consequently we have E(vn) → 0, so that vn → v0 and v0 is a constant. Moreover,

Moreover u0 is a solution of (1.11) with a = a0. Finally, since RΩ a0 = 0 we infer

that u0 ≡ 0, i.e. un → 0 in X, and consequently in C2(Ω).

3. Some results via sub-supersolutions

We use now the asymptotic proﬁle of u1,λ as λ → 0 to show that for λ > 0 suﬃciently
small a solution of (Pλ) can be obtained by the sub-supersolutions method. In particular,
the assumption p < 2∗ can be dropped.

Proposition 3.1. Assume that Ωb
(Pλ) has a nontrivial non-negative solution Uλ for 0 < λ < Λ0. Moreover Uλ → 0 in X as
λ → 0+.

+ 6= ∅ and RΩ b < 0. Then there exists Λ0 > 0 such that

Proof. First we obtain a supersolution of (Pλ). To this end, we consider the problem

(−∆w = (b(x) + δ)|w|q−2w in Ω,

∂w
∂n = 0

on ∂Ω.

If δ > 0 is such that RΩ(b + δ) < 0 then this problem has a nontrivial non-negative solution

2−q wδ. Then u is a weak supersolution of (Pλ) if

wδ. We set u = λ

On the other hand, since Ωb

This inequality is clearly satisﬁed for ε > 0 suﬃciently small since b ≥ δ′ > 0 in Ω′. Finally,
taking ε > 0 smaller if necessary, we have εφ′
1 ≤ u in Ω. By [16, Theorem 2] we deduce that
(Pλ) has a solution Uλ which satisﬁes εφ′
2−q wδ in Ω for λ < Λ0. In particular,
we have Uλ → 0 in C(Ω), and consequently in X, as λ → 0+.

We prove now that bifurcation of nontrivial non-negative solutions from zero can not

Proof. We use a variant of a comparison principle for concave problems due to Ambrosetti-
Brezis-Cerami [3, Lemma 3.3]. Let u ∈ B+ be a nontrivial non-negative solution of (Pλ)

(−∆ + M )u ≥ 0 and (−∆u + M )u 6≡ 0 in Ωb

Proposition 3.3. Under the assumptions of Lemma 3.2, bifurcation from zero never occurs
for (Pλ) at any λ > 0. More precisely, it never occurs that there exist λn and nontrivial
non-negative solutions uλn of (Pλn ) such that λn → λ∗ > 0 and un → 0 in C(Ω).

Proof. Assume by contradiction that λn → λ∗ > 0 and un is a nontrivial non-negative
solution of (Pλn ) with un → 0 in C(Ω). By Lemma 3.2 we must have un ∈ B−
0 for n large
enough. Moreover, we have un → 0 in X. We set vn = un
kunk and assume that vn ⇀ v0 in X
and vn → v0 in Lp(Ω) and Lq(Ω). Given φ ∈ X we have

5. Bifurcation for a regularized problem

In this section we deal with the following Neumann boundary value problem with

λ ∈ IR and ǫ > 0:

(−∆u = a(x)|u|p−2u + λm(x)|u + ǫ|q−2u in Ω,

∂u
∂n = 0

on ∂Ω.

Here m ∈ C α(Ω), α ∈ (0, 1), satisﬁes

Linearizing (5.1) at u = 0 we obtain

Ωm

+ 6= ∅,

and ZΩ

m < 0.

(−∆ϕ = λmǫq−2ϕ in Ω,

∂ϕ
∂n = 0

on ∂Ω.

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

Under (5.2) this problem has exactly two principal eigenvalues λ = 0 and λ = λm,ǫ > 0,
which are both simple. We denote by ϕm,ǫ a positive eigenfunction associated to λm,ǫ which
is normalized as kϕm,ǫkC(Ω) = 1. Note that ϕm,ǫ > 0 on Ω.

We state now the main result of this section for (5.1):

Theorem 5.1. Let 1 < q < 2 < p and 0 < ǫ ≤ 1. Assume (5.2). Then (5.1) possesses
exactly two bifurcation points (0, 0), (λm,ǫ, 0) on {(λ, 0) : λ ∈ IR} from which emanate two
subcontinua of positive solutions C0 = C0(m, ǫ), C1 = C1(m, ǫ), respectively. Moreover, the
following assertions hold:

26

HUMBERTO RAMOS QUOIRIN AND KENICHIRO UMEZU

(1) Let Z be any complement of h1i in C2+α(Ω). Then the set {(λ, u)} of nontrivial

solutions of (5.1) around (0, 0) is parametrized as

(λ, u) = (µ(s), s(1 + z(s))).

with s ∈ (−s0, s0), for some s0 > 0. Here µ : (−s0, s0) → IR and z : (−s0, s0) →
Z are continuous and satisfy µ(0) = z(0) = 0. So C0 is described exactly by
{(µ(s), s(1 + z(s))) : s ∈ [0, s0)} around (0, 0). Furthermore:
(a) µ(s) satisﬁes

lim
s→0

µ(s)

sp−2 = −ǫ2−q RΩ a
RΩ m

;

(5.4)

(b) If, in addition, p > 2 is an integer and RΩ a = 0, then µ(s) is analytic at s = 0,

and its derivatives µ(k) satisfy

µ(k)(0) = 0 < µ(2p−4)(0)

for 1 ≤ k < 2p − 4.

(5.5)

(2) Let W be any complement of hϕm,ǫi in C2+α(Ω). Then the set {(λ, u)} of nontrivial

solutions of (5.1) around (λm,ǫ, 0) is parametrized as

(λ, u) = (γ(s), s(ϕm,ǫ + w(s))),

with s ∈ (−s0, s0), for some s0 > 0. Here γ : (−s0, s0) → IR and w : (−s0, s0) → W
are continuous and satisfy γ(0) = λm,ǫ and w(0) = 0. So C1 is described exactly by
{(γ(s), s(ϕm,ǫ + w(s)) : s ∈ [0, s0)} around (λm,ǫ, 0).

(3) Regarding the global nature of C0 and C1, we have the following:

(a) C0 ∪ C1 does not meet (λ, 0) except λ = 0 and λ = λm,ǫ.
(b) The following alternative holds: either C0 = {(λ, u)} and C1 = {(λ, u)} are both

unbounded in IR × C(Ω) or they coincide.

Proof of Theorem 5.1. Under (5.2) we observe that the principal eigenvalues λ = 0 and
λ = λm,ǫ both satisfy the transversality condition of Crandall and Rabinowitz. Hence
the standard local bifurcation theory [10, Theorem 1.7] and the unilateral global bifurcation
theory [24, Theorem 1.27] (see also [20, Theorem 6.4.3]) are applicable at (0, 0) and (λm,ǫ, 0).
We obtain then two subcontinua C0, C1 of positive solutions of (5.1) emanating from (0, 0)
and (λm,ǫ, 0), respectively. Moreover, assertions (1), (2) and (3) are promptly veriﬁed,
except (5.4) and (5.5).

Let us show (5.4) in assertion (1)(a). From assertion (1) we deduce that

as s → 0+,

Next we verify (5.5) in assertion (1)(b). Following the Lyapunov-Schmidt method, we

reduce (5.1) to a bifurcation equation around the origin in IR2. Let w = Qu = u − 1

ΩRΩ u,
where Q is deﬁned as a linear mapping from L2(Ω) to {w ∈ L2(Ω) : RΩ w = 0}. We also
|Ω|RΩ u, so that u = t + w. Using Q we decompose (5.1) orthogonally in the

write t = 1

AN INDEFINITE CONCAVE-CONVEX EQUATION UNDER A NEUMANN BOUNDARY CONDITION 27

following way: for |λ| < λ∗ and u ∈ U , a small neighborhood of 0 in C2+α(Ω), we have

Q(−∆u) = Q(aup−1 + λm(u + ǫ)q−2u),
(1 − Q)(−∆u) = (1 − Q)(aup−1 + λm(u + ǫ)q−2u).

(5.6)

(5.7)

By applying the implicit function theorem we see that (5.6) is uniquely solvable at (λ, t, w) =
(0, 0, 0) by some w = w(λ, t) which is analytic at (0, 0) and satisﬁes w(λ, 0) = 0 for λ
suﬃciently small. We plug u = t + w(λ, t) in (5.7), to obtain the following bifurcation
equation around the origin in IR2:

Φ(λ, t) :=ZΩ

a(t + w(λ, t))p−1 + λZΩ

Note that Φ is also analytic at (0, 0).

m(t + w(λ, t) + ǫ)q−2(t + w(λ, t)) = 0.

(5.8)

We shall now analyse Φ in (5.8) for (λ, t) around (0, 0) using its Taylor series expan-

sion. As a preliminary, we compute the partial derivatives of w(λ, t) at (0, 0):

Lemma 5.2.

1 ≤ j < p − 1,

Proof of Lemma 5.2. We denote the partial derivatives of w simply by wλ, wt, wλλ, wtt, wλt.

(1) By the uniqueness ensured by the implicit function theorem, we see that w(λ, 0) = 0

for λ close to 0. This provides assertion (1).

(2) Note that w = w(λ, t) satisﬁes

repeatedly and put (λ, t) = (0, 0) therein. To this end it is enough to consider
the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of the equation in (5.9), i.e. the term η :=
Q[a(p−1)(t+w)p−2(1+wt)]. For instance, let us discuss the case k = 2: we consider
the derivative

ηt = Q[a(p − 1)(p − 2)(t + w)p−3(1 + wt) + a(p − 1)(t + w)p−2wtt].

It follows that

ηt(0, 0) =(cid:26) Q[(p − 1)(p − 2)a],

which yields Assertion (3).

(4) In (5.14) we put

ζ(λ, t) =ZΩ

a(p − 1){(p − 2)(t + w)p−3(1 + wt)2 + (t + w)p−2wtt}

Then we deduce from (5.14) that

where Hj is bounded. Let us verify (5.11) in the case k = 2: we consider j = 3 in

Here it is understood that (t + w)ℓ = 0 if ℓ < 0. Putting (λ, t) = (0, 0) here, it

Φttt(0, 0) = ζt(0, 0) =(cid:26) 6RΩ awtt(0, 0) = 3RΩ |∇wtt(0, 0)|2,

ℓ ≥ 1. Thus Assertion (5.11) with k = 2 has been veriﬁed.

We prove now (5.12) in the case k = 2: we consider j = 4 in (5.15) and diﬀeren-

When p ≥ 4 we deduce ζtt(0, 0) = 0 in view of Remark 5.3. Hence Assertion (5.12)
with k = 2 has been veriﬁed. In a similar way, we can verify assertions (5.11) and
(5.12) for the general case k > 2, using the diﬀerential chain rule.

The proof of Lemma 5.4 is now complete.

(cid:3)

We conclude now the veriﬁcation of (5.5): from Lemma 5.4(1)-(3) and the fact that
Φ is analytic at (0, 0), we deduce that the Taylor series expansion of Φ at (0, 0) is provided
by

Φ(λ, t) = t(cid:18)λ

∂2Φ
∂t∂λ

where Ψ(λ, t) is a higher order term. We put

Note that ξ(0, 0) = 0 and

∂ξ
∂λ

(0, 0) =

∂t∂λ

(0, 0) < 0.

Hence the implicit function theorem can be applied to deduce that the solution set of

of the rescaled problem developed in this section, and an application of the implicit function
theorem to the reduced problem. More precisely, by the rescaling v = λ− 1

The existence and uniqueness of w(µ, t) is ensured by the implicit function theorem. Then

we can prove that if (cid:0)RΩ a(cid:1)(cid:0)RΩ b(cid:1) < 0 then

As a byproduct relying on the uniqueness result for ˆvλ in Remark 5.6, we show that
the variational positive solution u1,λ of (Pλ) given by Proposition 2.6 is asymptotically stable

for λ > 0 suﬃciently small when RΩ a < 0 <RΩ b.
Proposition 5.7. Under the assumptions of Proposition 2.6, if RΩ a < 0 < RΩ b then u1,λ

is asymptotically stable for λ > 0 suﬃciently small.

Proof. With the aid of the argument in Remark 5.6, it suﬃces to show that the positive
solution vµ = t(µ) + w(µ, t(µ)) of (5.17) is asymptotically stable for µ > 0 suﬃciently small.
To this end, recalling (1.7), we investigate the sign of the ﬁrst eigenvalue ˆγ = ˆγ1,µ of the

Proposition 6.1. Assume that there exists a ball B such that B ⊂ Ω with the condition

a ≥ 0, a 6≡ 0

and b > 0 on B.

Then there exists constants λ > 0 and ǫ0 > 0 such that (Pλ,ǫ) has no nontrivial non-negative
solutions for any λ ≥ λ and ǫ ∈ (0, ǫ0].

Proof. The proof is carried out as for Proposition 4.1, with small modiﬁcations. Let
ϕ = ϕD(B) ∈ C2(B) be a positive eigenfunction associated with the ﬁrst eigenvalue
λ1 = λD(B) > 0 of (2.9) with Ω replaced by B. We extend ϕ to the whole Ω by set-

Let u ∈ C2(Ω) be a nontrivial non-negative solution of (Pλ,ǫ). Note that u > 0 in

Corollary 6.2. Assume (H0). Then there exists constant λ > 0 and ǫ0 > 0 such that (Pλ,ǫ)
has no nontrivial non-negative solutions for any |λ| ≥ λ and ǫ ∈ (0, ǫ0].

Proof. It suﬃces to note that if u is a nontrivial non-negative solution of (Pλ,ǫ) for some
λ < 0, then −∆u = aup−1 + (−λ)(−bǫ)(u + ǫ)q−2u in Ω.
(cid:3)

Next we obtain a priori bounds in C(Ω) for nontrivial non-negative solutions of (Pλ,ǫ).

We recall that

Ωa

± = {x ∈ Ω : a ≷ 0}, Ωa

0 = {x ∈ Ω : a = 0}, Ωb

± = {x ∈ Ω : b ≷ 0}.

We assume that Ωa

± are both subdomains of Ω with smooth boundary and satisfy (H1), i.e.

Ωa

+ ⊂ Ω, Ωa

− = Ω.

Proposition 6.3. Assume (H1) and let Λ > 0. Suppose there exists a constant C1 > 0 such
that kukC(Ωa
+) ≤ C1 for all nontrivial non-negative solutions u of (Pλ,ǫ) with λ ∈ [0, Λ] and
ǫ ∈ (0, 1]. Then there exists C2 > 0 such that kukC(Ω) ≤ C2 for all nontrivial non-negative
solutions u of (Pλ,ǫ) with λ ∈ [0, Λ] and ǫ ∈ (0, 1].

Proof. The argument relies on the use of the comparison principle for a concave problem:
consider the problem

v = C1

∂n = 0

Let u be a nontrivial non-negative solution of (Pλ,ǫ) with λ ∈ [0, Λ] and ǫ ∈ (0, 1]. The
strong maximum principle and boundary point lemma ensure u > 0 in Ωa

Hence w is a supersoltuion of (6.1), where C can be chosen independently of λ ∈ [0, Λ]
and ǫ ∈ (0, 1]. By using a variant of [3, Lemma 3.3], we deduce u ≤ w in Ωa

Then u is a subsolution of this problem. The rest of the argument is the same as in the

(cid:3)

Based on Corollary 6.4, we use an argument from Amann and Lopez-Gomez [2] (see
also Section 6 of L´opez-G´omez, Molina-Meyer and Tellini [22]) to obtain a priori bounds in
C(Ω) for positive solutions of (Pλ,ǫ):

Proposition 6.5. Assume (H1) and (H2). Then, for any Λ > 0 there exists CΛ > 0 such
that kukC(Ω) ≤ CΛ for all nontrivial non-negative solutions of (Pλ,ǫ) with λ ∈ [−Λ, Λ] and
ǫ ∈ (0, 1].

Now we assume (1.14). Note that bǫ satisﬁes (5.2) with m = bǫ. Then, by applying
Theorem 5.1 with m = bǫ, (Pλ,ǫ) possesses exactly two bifurcation points (0, 0) and (λǫ, 0),
where λǫ = λbǫ ,ǫ, from which there bifurcate subcontinua C0(ǫ) = C0(bǫ, ǫ) and C1(ǫ) =
C1(bǫ, ǫ) of positive solutions, respectively, and C0(ǫ) and C1(ǫ) satisfy assertions (1)-(3) in
Theorem 5.1 with m = bǫ. Moreover, the bifurcation point (λǫ, 0) tends to (0, 0):

Lemma 6.6.

This problem has the smallest eigenvalue µ1,ǫ(λ) which satisﬁes

µ1,ǫ(λ) < 0,

for λ = 0, λǫ,

has a unique positive prinicipal eigenvalue λ1(b) with a positive eigenfunction ϕ1(b).

This implies µ1,ǫ(λ) < 0, and hence, λǫ < λ, as desired.

Next we consider the case RΩ b = 0. In this case, the eigenvalue problem

(−∆φ = λbφ + µ(λ)φ in Ω,

∂φ
∂n = 0

on ∂Ω

has the smallest eigenvalue µ1(λ), which is negative for every λ > 0. Let λ > 0. Since

µ1(λ) < 0, we can choose φ such that RΩ |∇φ|2 − λRΩ bφ2 < 0. Note that φ is not a
constant, so that RΩ bφ2 > 1
λRΩ |∇φ|2 > 0. Then there exist ǫ1 > 0 and c1 > 0 such that
if 0 < ǫ ≤ ǫ1 then RΩ bǫφ2 > c1. The rest of the proof in this case is the same as in the

previous case. The proof of Lemma 6.6 is complete.

(cid:3)

Now Corollary 6.2 and Proposition 6.5 provide suﬃcient conditions under which C0(ǫ)

and C1(ǫ) are bounded in IR × C(Ω), and consequently coincide:

Theorem 6.7. Let 1 < q < 2 < p and ǫ > 0. Assume (1.14), (H0), (H1) and (H2), and
in addition, 0 < ǫ ≤ ǫ0, where ǫ0 is given by Corollary 6.2. Then the subcontinua C0(ǫ) and
C1(ǫ) obtained in Theorem 5.1 with m = bǫ are bounded in IR × C(Ω), uniformly in ǫ > 0
small. Consequently, C0(ǫ) = C1(ǫ) (see Figure 2).

Proof. By Corollary 6.2 and Proposition 6.5 we know that if u is a nontrivial non-negative
solution of (Pλ,ǫ) then |λ| ≤ λ and kukC(Ω) ≤ Cλ for some λ and Cλ. Hence the conclusion
follows from Theorem 5.1(3).
(cid:3)

From now on we write C∗(ǫ) = C0(ǫ) = C1(ǫ). As a by-product of Theorem 6.7,

we determine the direction of the bifurcation C0(ǫ) at (0, 0) if RΩ a ≥ 0, which partially

complements (5.4) and (5.5). To this end we use the following lemma:

Lemma 6.8. The following two assertions hold:

(1) If RΩ a ≥ 0 then there is no positive solution of (1.11).

(2) Assume 2 < p < 2N

kukC(Ω) ≥ C for all positive solutions of (1.11).

of (1.11). We set vn = un
kunk and assume that vn ⇀ v0 in X, vn → v0 in Lp(Ω), and
vn → v0 a.e. in Ω, for some v0 ∈ H 1(Ω). We deduce that

(cid:3)

Corollary 6.9. In addition to the conditions of Theorem 6.7, assume that RΩ a ≥ 0. Then

C0(ǫ) bifurcates to the region λ > 0 at (0, 0), that is, µ(s) > 0 for s > 0 small in Theorem
5.1(1) with m = bǫ.

Proof. We argue by contradiction: in view of Lemma 6.8(1) we may assume λn < 0 and a
positive solution un of (Pλn,ǫ) such that λn → 0− and kunkC(Ω) → 0. Theorem 5.1(1) shows
that (λn, un) ∈ C∗(ǫ)(= C0(ǫ)). Hence Theorem 6.7 ensures that C∗(ǫ) should contain (0, u)
for some u 6= 0. However, this contradicts Lemma 6.8(1).
(cid:3)

Let us show now that under (H3) bifurcation from zero can not occur for (Pλ) at any
λ 6= 0, i.e. it never occurs that there are λn → λ∗ 6= 0 and nontrivial non-negative solutions
un of (Pλn ) such that un → 0 in C(Ω). This result is deduced from Proposition 3.3:

Proposition 6.10. Assume (H3). Then bifurcation from zero never occurs for (Pλ) at any
λ 6= 0.

Proof. The assertion for λ > 0 has been already veriﬁed in Proposition 3.3. Assume that
λn → λ∗ < 0 and un are nontrivial non-negative solutions of (Pλn ) with un → 0 in C(Ω).
Then (λn, un) satisﬁes

+ is a subdomain of Ω, Proposition 3.3 provides us with a
(cid:3)

We are now in position to prove Theorem 1.6.

Proof of Theorem 1.6. We use Whyburn’s topological method [29]. Let us recall from [29]
that if En ⊂ X for a complete metric space X, then

lim inf En = {x ∈ X :

lim
n→∞

dist (x, En) = 0},

lim sup En = {x ∈ X : lim inf
n→∞

dist (x, En) = 0}.

Note that the values λ from Corollary 6.2 and CΛ from Proposition 6.5 do not depend on
the value ǫ > 0 determined in Theorem 6.7. Hence, we see that for such ǫ

C∗(ǫ) ⊂ {(λ, u) ∈ IR × C(Ω) : |λ| ≤ λ + 1, 0 ≤ u < CΛ + 1 on Ω}.

It’s then clear that C∗(ǫ) is non-empty and connected, and (0, 0) ∈ lim inf C∗(ǫ). Moreover,

by elliptic regularity,Sǫ C∗(ǫ) is precompact. Indeed, for any {(λn, un)} ⊂Sǫ C∗(ǫ) it follows

that (λn, un) ∈ C∗(ǫn) for some ǫn ∈ (0, 1], so that un ∈ C2(Ω), and

(−∆un = aup−1

∂un
∂n = 0

n + λnbǫn(un + ǫn)q−2un

in Ω,
on ∂Ω.

Since |λn| ≤ λ+1 and kunkC(Ω) ≤ CΛ+1, by elliptic regularity we ﬁnd a constant C > 0 such
that kunkC1+θ(Ω) ≤ C for all n. By the compact embedding C1+θ(Ω) ⊂ C(Ω), a subsequence
of (un) converges to some u0 in C(Ω), as desired.

Now, by [29, Theorem 9.1], we deduce that C := lim supǫ→0+ C∗(ǫ) is non-empty,
closed and connected. In addition, C is contained in the non-negative solutions set of (Pλ).
Indeed, let (λ, u) ∈ C. Then we deduce that there exists (λn, un) ∈ C∗(ǫn) such that

38

HUMBERTO RAMOS QUOIRIN AND KENICHIRO UMEZU

(λn, un) → (λ, u) in IR × C(Ω). Similarly as in the above argument, elliptic regularity and
Schauder estimates yield a constant C > 0 such that kunkC2+θ(Ω) ≤ C for all n. By a
compactness argument, we deduce that a subsequence of (un) converges to u in C2(Ω), so
that u is a non-negative solution of (Pλ), as desired. Furthermore, from Lemma 6.6 we infer
that C is a loop type subcontinuum in the sense that it bifurcates at (0, 0) and goes back to
(0, 0).

It remains to show that C is nontrivial. Since RΩ a < 0, assertion (5.4) with m = bǫ

enables us to deduce that for any ǫ > 0 small there exists uǫ 6= 0 such that (0, uǫ) ∈ C∗(ǫ).
Then uǫ is a positive solution of (1.11). By a standard compactness argument, there exist
some sequences ǫn and un := uǫn such that ǫn ց 0 and un converges to a non-negative
solution u0 of (1.11) in C(Ω). By deﬁnition, we have (0, u0) ∈ C. In addition, we deduce
that u0 is positive on Ω thanks to Lemma 6.8(2). This implies that C is nontrivial, i.e.
it
never shrinks to the λ axis. Finally, by Proposition 6.10 we infer that C \ {(0, 0)} does not
include trivial solutions (λ, 0) with λ 6= 0, and by Lemma 6.8(2) that there exists δ > 0 such
that C never meets any positive solution u of (1.11) satisfying kukC(Ω) ≤ δ.

The proof of Theorem 1.6 is now complete.

(cid:3)

6.1. Remarks and expectations.

there exists ǫn ց 0, un 6= 0 such that C∗(ǫn) include (0, un), respectively.

(1) Theorem 1.6 remains true if we replace the conditionRΩ a < 0 by the condition that
(2) If instead of RΩ a < 0 we assume now RΩ a ≥ 0 in Theorem 1.6 then we expect the

existence of a loop type subcontinuum of nontrivial non-negative solutions of (Pλ)
bifurcating at (0, 0) as in Figure 4. Note that, by Corollary 6.9, C∗(ǫ) bifurcates
to the region λ > 0 at (0, 0). In addition, Lemma 6.8(1) tells us that C∗(ǫ) never
meets the vertical axis λ = 0. The nontrivial non-negative solutions u1,λ, u2,λ of
(Pλ) provided by Theorem 1.1 via a variational approach and also the non-existence
result in Remark 1.5 would strongly support this suggestion. See also Remark 2.13

(2) for the case RΩ a = 0. However, we couldn’t exclude the possibility that C∗(ǫ)

shrinks to the origin (0, 0) as ǫ → 0+.
