LINEAR PROPERTIES OF BANACH SPACES AND LOW DISTORTION

EMBEDDINGS OF METRIC GRAPHS

ANTON´IN PROCH ´AZKA

Dedicated to the memory of Luis S´anchez Gonz´alez

Abstract. We characterize non-reﬂexive Banach spaces by a low-distortion (resp. isometric)
embeddability of a certain metric graph up to a renorming. Also we study non-linear suﬃcient
conditions for (cid:96)n

1 being (1 + ε)-isomorphic to a subspace of a Banach space X.

In [9], L. S´anchez and the author have shown the following characterization.

1. Introduction

Theorem 1. There is a bounded countable metric graph M(cid:96)1 with the following properties.
a) If M(cid:96)1 Lipschitz-embeds into a Banach space X with distortion D < 2 (denoted M (cid:44)→
then X contains an isomorphic copy of (cid:96)1.
on X such that M(cid:96)1 embeds isometrically into (X,|·|).

b) Conversely, if X contains an isomorphic copy of (cid:96)1 then there is an equivalent norm |·|

D

In this article we modify the methods used to prove this theorem to obtain some further
results. Namely, the aim of Section 2 is to present a similar bounded countable metric graph
MR which satisﬁes the above theorem with the property “X contains an isomorphic copy of
(cid:96)1” replaced by the property “X is non-reﬂexive” (Theorem 3). We also brieﬂy discuss the
importance of the renorming in these theorems.

In Section 3 we establish a local version of Theorem 1 a), i.e. a theorem where M(cid:96)1 is
1 . In fact, using an

ultraproduct argument one can get quite immediately from Theorem 1 a) the following.

that M(cid:96)1 =(cid:83) Mn. Then for every ε > 0, D ∈ [1, 2) and every n ∈ N there exists k ∈ N such

The downside is that this theorem nor its proof do not provide any information about the
dependence of k on n. The goal of Section 3 is dispensing of the ultraproduct argument in

Finally in Section 4 we will prove Theorem 2 and indicate some directions for possible future
Throughout the paper we will need the following notions and notation. A mapping f : M →
N between metric spaces (M, d) and (N, ρ) is called Lipschitz embedding if there are constants
C1, C2 > 0 such that C1d(x, y) ≤ ρ(f (x), f (y)) ≤ C2d(x, y) for all x, y ∈ M . The distortion

satisfy the above inequality. We say that M Lipschitz embeds (embeds for brevity) into N
with distortion D (in short M (cid:44)→
N ) if there exists a Lipschitz embedding f : M → N with
dist(f ) ≤ D. In this case, if the target space N is a Banach space, we may always assume (by
taking C−1

2. Low-distortion characterization of reflexivity

Let MR = {0} ∪ N ∪ F where F = {(cid:74)1, n(cid:75) : n ∈ N} ∪ {(cid:74)n,∞(cid:74): n ∈ N}. We introduce on MR

a graph structure: the edges are couples of the form {0, a}, a ∈ N, or {a, A}, a ∈ N, A ∈ F
and a ∈ F . Finally, we equip MR with the shortest path distance.
Theorem 3. a) Let X be a Banach space and D ∈ [1, 2). If MR (cid:44)→
embeds isometrically into (X,|·|).
Proof. a) Assume that f : M → X satisﬁes f (0) = 0 and

X then X is non-reﬂexive.
b) Conversely, if X is non-reﬂexive then there is an equivalent norm |·| on X such that MR

D

d(x, y) ≤ (cid:107)f (x) − f (y)(cid:107) ≤ Dd(x, y)

satisﬁes

for some D < 2 and all x, y ∈ MR. Then, each x∗ ∈ BX that norms f ((cid:74)1, n(cid:75)) − f ((cid:74)n + 1,∞(cid:74))

i=n+1) ≥ 4 − 2D for every n ∈ N.
b) Let us ﬁrst observe that MR embeds isometrically into (c,(cid:107)·(cid:107)∞), the space of convergent

Φ((cid:74)n,∞(cid:74)) = −21(cid:74)1,n(cid:75)
Φ(n) = −1(cid:74)1,n(cid:75) + 1(cid:74)n+1,∞(cid:74)

Then Φ is an isometric embedding. Indeed, (cid:74)1, n(cid:75) ∩(cid:74)m,∞(cid:74)= ∅ iﬀ m ≥ n + 1. In this case
the supports of Φ((cid:74)1, n(cid:75)) and Φ((cid:74)m,∞(cid:74)) intersect and we have (cid:107)Φ((cid:74)1, n(cid:75)) − Φ((cid:74)m,∞(cid:74))(cid:107)∞ = 4.
Otherwise the supports do not intersect and we have (cid:107)Φ(I) − Φ(J)(cid:107)∞ = 2. For the possible
distances between Φ((cid:74)1, n(cid:75)) and Φ(m), resp. Φ((cid:74)n,∞(cid:74)) and Φ(m), consult Figure 1.
Now, let Y be a one-codimensional subspace of X. Clearly, Y is not reﬂexive. Let θ ∈ (0, 1).
By the proof of James lemma (see [3, page 52]), there exist F ∈ BY ∗∗ and sequences (xn) ⊂ SY ,

Remark 5. If (xn) ⊂ BX is a 1-separated sequence, then any bijection f : MR → {xn} satisﬁes
dist(f ) ≤ 8. Thus MR embeds with distortion 8 into any inﬁnite-dimensional Banach space.
We do not know whether MR embeds into some reﬂexive space X with distortion 2. In other
words, we do not know whether the constant 2 in Theorem 3 a) is optimal.

Finally let us mention that the method using [2] does not work for distortions less than 3 as
it is easily seen that MR does not embed into a stable metric space with distortion less than 3.

3. Low-distortion representation of (cid:96)n
1

In this section we state and prove a quantitative version of Theorem 2 for a particular
choice of spaces Mn ⊂ M(cid:96)1. Even though it will not be really used, we recall for readers’
convenenience the deﬁnition of the space M(cid:96)1. The vertex set is M(cid:96)1 = {0} ∪ N ∪ F with
F = {A ⊂ N : 1 ≤ |A| < ∞}. A pair {a, b} is an edge either if a = 0 and b ∈ N, or if a ∈ N,
b ∈ F and a ∈ b. The space M(cid:96)1 is equipped with the shortes path metric.
The most natural choice of the spaces Mn seems to be the following. We put Mn = {0} ∪
(cid:74)1, n(cid:75) ∪ Fn where Fn = 2(cid:74)1,n(cid:75) \ {∅}. The graph structure and the metric are induced by the

space M(cid:96)1.

The main result of this section follows.

The isomorphism constant can be arbitrarily reduced, at the cost of augmenting the size

In order to prove Theorem 6 we will need the following lemma, which is a ﬁnite-dimensional

version of Proposition 4 in [10].

Lemma 7. Let S be a set, K > 0 and let (fi)n

r ∈ R such that these functions satisfy that for every A ⊂(cid:74)1, n(cid:75) there is s ∈ S for which

Proof of Theorem 6 a). Assume that f : Mn → X satisﬁes f (0) = 0 and

d(x, y) ≤ (cid:107)f (x) − f (y)(cid:107) ≤ Dd(x, y)

for some D < 4

3 and all x, y ∈ Mn. We put
Xa,b = {x∗ ∈ BX∗ : (cid:104)x∗, f (a)(cid:105) ≥ 4 − 3D,(cid:104)x∗, f (b)(cid:105) ≤ −4 + 3D} .

We claim that for every A, B ⊂(cid:74)1, n(cid:75) such that A ∩ B = ∅ and A ∪ B (cid:54)= ∅, we have

a∈A,b∈B

Indeed, in the case A (cid:54)= ∅ (cid:54)= B we take x∗ ∈ K such that (cid:104)x∗, f (A) − f (B)(cid:105) = (cid:107)f (A) − f (B)(cid:107) ≥

The proof of Theorem 6 b) will depend on the following well known lemma.

Lemma 8. For every α ∈ (0, 1] there is η = η(α) > 0 such that for each k ∈ N and each S ⊂

2(cid:74)1,k(cid:75), the estimate |S| ≥ 2αk implies that there exists H ∈(cid:0)(cid:74)1,k(cid:75)

(cid:1) such that {A ∩ H : A ∈ S} =

(cid:100)ηk(cid:101)

The proof of this lemma is in turn based on the combination of the following two lemmas,

for all x, y ∈ Mk. To simplify notation we will denote x(cid:48) := f (x) for each x ∈ Mk. Let
rj := −D + j(D− 2) for j ∈(cid:74)1, c(cid:75). Then any closed interval of lenght 4− 2D which is contained
in [−D, D] contains at least two diﬀerent points rj. We claim that for every A ∈ 2(cid:74)1,k(cid:75) there
are j ∈(cid:74)1, c − 1(cid:75) and x∗ ∈ BX∗ such that
for all a ∈ A and all b ∈ B :=(cid:74)1, k(cid:75) \ A. Indeed, we take x∗ ∈ BX∗ such that

(cid:104)x∗, b(cid:48)(cid:105) ≤ rj < rj+1 ≤ (cid:104)x∗, a(cid:48)(cid:105)

(cid:104)x∗, A(cid:48) − B(cid:48)(cid:105) = (cid:107)A(cid:48) − B(cid:48)(cid:107) if A (cid:54)= ∅ (cid:54)= B

(cid:104)x∗, A(cid:48)(cid:105) = (cid:107)A(cid:48)(cid:107) if B = ∅
(cid:104)x∗,−B(cid:48)(cid:105) = (cid:107)B(cid:48)(cid:107) if A = ∅

In the ﬁrst case we get for all a ∈ A and all b ∈ B that (cid:104)x∗, a(cid:48) − b(cid:48)(cid:105) ≥ 4 − 2D. Moreover
(cid:104)x∗, a(cid:48)(cid:105) ,(cid:104)x∗, b(cid:48)(cid:105) ∈ [−D, D] so the claim follows by the choice of (rj). In the second case we get
for all a ∈ A that (cid:104)x∗, a(cid:48)(cid:105) ≥ 2− D, and in the last case we get for all b ∈ B that (cid:104)x∗, b(cid:48)(cid:105) ≤ D− 2.

Let us mention the following folklore result which according to G. Lancien goes back to

G. Schechtmann.
Theorem 11. Let X be a Banach space such that dim X < ∞. Then for every D ≥ 1 and
ε > 0 there is a ﬁnite set F ⊂ X such that for any given Banach space Y the fact F (cid:44)→
Y
implies that X is (D + ε)-isomorphic to a subspace of Y .

that there are D > 1 and ε > 0 such that for every k ∈ N there is a Banach space Yk and
an embedding fk : Fk (cid:44)→
Yk but X is not (D + ε)-isomorphic to any subspace of Yk. Then

Proof. Let (Fn) ⊂ 2X be any increasing family of ﬁnite sets such that(cid:83) Fn = X. Let us assume
Φ(x) := [(fn(x))n] for x ∈(cid:83) Fn and extended by continuity to the whole X is an embedding of
X into(cid:81)U Yk with distortion D. By the theorem of Heinrich and Mankiewicz [4, Theorem 7.9]
X linearly embeds into ((cid:81)U Yk)∗ with distortion D. By local reﬂexivity X embeds linearly into
(cid:81)U Yk with distortion D + ε/3 and therefore X embeds into some Yk linearly with distortion

for any space X and withouth any restriction on the distortion. Also the set F is isometrically
in X. On the other hand, any other information on the nature of F is completely inaccessible.
It could be interesting to give a concrete example of such sets for a given ﬁnite dimensional
space X.

p with 1 ≤ p ≤ 2, one can say more. Let C n
p be the “n-cube” equipped with
the (cid:96)p-norm. We recall a result of Bourgain, Milman and Wolﬀson [5, page 297] which says:
Let 1 ≤ p ≤ 2. Assume that there exists D > 0 such that C n
p (cid:44)→
Y for every n. Then for every
ε > 0 and n ∈ N there is a subspace of Y which is (1 + ε)-isomorphic to (cid:96)n
p .

Essentially the same proof as the one of Theorem 2 gives therefore the following. Let 1 ≤
p ≤ 2. Then for every ε > 0, D > 0 and n ∈ N there is k ∈ N such that for every Banach space
Y we have that C k

p is (1 + ε)-isomorphic to a subspace of Y .

Y implies that (cid:96)n

p (cid:44)→

D

The dependence of k on n does not seem to follow from the proof in [5].
