We investigate axial charge production in two-color QCD out of equilibrium. We compute the real-time
evolution starting with spatially homogeneous strong gauge ﬁelds, while the fermions are in vacuum. The
idealized class of initial conditions is motivated by Glasma ﬂux tubes in the context of heavy-ion collisions.
We focus on axial charge production at early times, where important aspects of the anomalous dynamics can be
derived analytically. This is compared to real-time lattice simulations. Quark production at early times leading
to anomalous charge generation is investigated using Wilson fermions. Our results indicate that coherent gauge
ﬁelds can transiently produce signiﬁcant amounts of axial charge density, while part of the induced charges
persist to be present even well beyond characteristic decoherence times. The comparisons to analytic results
provide stringent tests of real-time representations of the axial anomaly on the lattice.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

Anomalous quantum processes violating classical symme-
tries play a crucial role for our understanding of fundamen-
tal properties of matter. A most prominent example con-
cerns the question about the origin of the matter-antimatter
asymmetry in the universe, which has long been discussed
in terms of sphaleron baryogenesis, where the sphalerons
denote the lowest-barrier conﬁgurations separating energy-
degenerate minima in the electroweak theory [1–3]. Similar
conﬁgurations are expected to play an important role during
the early stages of collision experiments with heavy nuclei,
and may lead to an anomalous generation of electric currents
from the so-called chiral magnetic effect in the context of the
theory of the strong interaction [4–7]. The departure from
thermal equilibrium is an essential ingredient in all scenarios
of baryogenesis from microphysical laws [8] and is crucial for
our understanding of the initial stages of very energetic heavy-
ion collisions [9, 10].

For nonabelian gauge theories in thermal equilibrium,
sphaleron transitions are expected to dominate the late-time
behavior of the Chern–Simons number associated to transi-
tions between topologically distinct ground states. The non-
perturbative computation of the thermal transition rate in the
presence of these spatially-localized classical ﬁeld conﬁgu-
rations can be achieved using classical real-time simulation
techniques on a lattice [11, 12].

Away from thermal equilibrium, the anomalous processes
are in general not related to thermal transitions between dif-
ferent vacua, but complicated out-of-equilibrium processes.
Recently, this has been investigated in the context of early-
universe electroweak baryogenesis from fast quench dynam-
ics [13], or highly populated gluon ﬁelds characteristic for the
initial stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions [14]. While
these lattice studies concentrate on the behavior of the Chern–
Simons number, out-of-equilibrium conditions can have dra-
matic consequences for the presence of transient anomalous
effects that are not associated to transitions between topolog-

ically distinct ground states. A recent example concerns the
phenomenon of anomaly-induced dynamical refringence in
strong-ﬁeld quantum electrodynamics despite its trivial vac-
uum structure [15].

In this work, we investigate transient anomalous effects in
quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with two colors. The aim is
to gain (semi-)analytical insights into axial charge generation
due to the Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomaly equation [16, 17]

out of equilibrium. It relates the four-divergence of the axial
current jµ
5 = ψγµγ5ψ (µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 with Dirac matrices γµ
and γ5 = iγ0γ1γ2γ3) to the mixing of the different chiral
components of the fermion ﬁelds ψ of mass m, and to the
anomaly term ∼ Ea · Ba involving the color electric ﬁelds Ea
and magnetic ﬁelds Ba (a = 1, 2, 3).
To this end, we consider the real-time evolution starting
with spatially homogeneous gauge ﬁelds. The ﬁeld conﬁgura-
tion is motivated by the Glasma ﬂux-tube scenario, where the
gluonic gauge ﬁelds in the immediate aftermath of a heavy-
ion collision are dominated by coherent longitudinal color-
electric and magnetic ﬁelds [9]. For a sufﬁciently energetic
collision, the relevant gauge coupling g is weak and we con-
sider g (cid:28) 1.
More precisely, we investigate an idealized class of initial
conditions, where the expectation values at time t = 0 for
color-electric ﬁelds Ea

corresponding to an energy density ∼ Q4/g2 parametrized in
terms of the characteristic scale Q. All other modes, as well
as the fermion sector, are taken to be in (free) vacuum ini-
tially. While we start with zero macroscopic color-magnetic
ﬁeld such that the anomalous contribution vanishes initially,
it is generated during subsequent times. The nonequilibrium
classical time evolution of the Yang–Mills ﬁelds can be solved
analytically [18–20]. By taking into account quantum ﬂuctu-
ations, one observes that the solution represents the leading

contribution for the corresponding quantum dynamics on a
time scale shorter than tΘ ∼ Q−1 ln g−2. This allows us to
derive a closed-form expression for the early-time behavior of
axial charge generation from the anomaly equation.

The times beyond tΘ, after which ﬂuctuations cause deco-
herence of the initially uniform ﬁelds, are no longer described
by our analytical treatment linearizing in ﬂuctuations. Us-
ing real-time lattice simulation techniques, we verify that the
early-time lattice dynamics indeed accurately reproduces our
analytical results. In particular, we ﬁnd that for given energy
density transient homogeneous ﬁeld contributions to the ax-
ial charge at early times can exceed by far those coming from
non-trivial ﬁeld conﬁgurations at later times [14].

While in general the investigation of more realistic ﬁeld
conﬁgurations and later times cannot be based on analytic so-
lutions and requires non-perturbative real-time lattice simula-
tion techniques [13, 21–29], our analytical expressions pro-
vide a stringent precision test for the numerical approaches.
On a lattice, the axial anomaly is deeply connected to the
fermion doubling problem and its regularization, which is well
understood in Euclidean or ‘imaginary-time’ lattice ﬁeld the-
ory [30–32].
In particular, for Euclidean Wilson fermions
all doublers can be regularized using a spatiotemporal Wil-
son term. In contrast, real-time simulations typically employ
a combination of a spatial Wilson term together with a sup-
pression of possible temporal doublers using suitable initial
conditions [13, 24]. Employing real-time lattice simulations
for two-color QCD, we analyze in detail the validity of the
axial anomaly equation on the lattice by explicitly computing
the nonequilibrium axial charge density from the underlying
fermion current.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II, we inves-
tigate the real-time evolution of the gauge ﬁeld sector. We
derive an analytic expression for the production of the ax-
ial charge and compare it to real-time lattice simulations in
pure gauge theory. In section III, we investigate the fermion
sector and perform real-time lattice simulations with Wilson
fermions. We analyze the axial anomaly out of equilibrium
and demonstrate that it can be accurately computed using a
spatial Wilson term. Section IV is devoted to concluding re-
marks. In an appendix, we show an alternative derivation of
the chiral anomaly with a cutoff regularization method.

II. TRANSIENT ANOMALOUS CHARGE PRODUCTION:

GAUGE SECTOR

A. Analytic discussion

We consider a nonabelian gauge theory with SU (2) color
gauge group. Taking two colors simpliﬁes the analysis as
compared to the SU (3) gauge group of QCD, while for our
aims the difference is of minor relevance. We do not con-
sider longitudinally expanding systems, such as addressed in
Ref. [33]. We concentrate on the nonequilibrium dynamics,
starting from an initial state characterized by macroscopic
color-electric ﬁelds of order (cid:104)E(0)(cid:105) ∼ Q2/g in the weak
gauge coupling g (cid:28) 1 relevant at a sufﬁciently high energy

scale Q. All other gauge ﬁeld modes, as well as the fermion
sector, are taken to be in (free) vacuum initially. The early-
time behavior for this problem can be solved analytically in an
expansion in powers of the gauge coupling g following along
the lines of Ref. [34], where simpler initial conditions have
been considered in the absence of anomalous corrections. In
particular, at leading order in g there is no back-reaction of the
fermion sector on the gauge ﬁeld dynamics at early times (see
e.g. [26]).

It is convenient to formulate the gauge ﬁeld dynamics in
µ(x) with x = (x0, x) in tem-
0(x) = 0, and to split the ﬁeld into a
i (x0)/g and

Introducing the rescaled macroscopic ﬁeld ¯A simpliﬁes the
power-counting in g. Starting from the spatially homogeneous
macroscopic ﬁeld conﬁguration, we may linearize the dynam-
ics in δA for sufﬁciently early times. The range of times, for
which the linearized description is valid, is determined below.
At zeroth order in the ﬂuctuations, we obtain the ﬁeld equa-

tion for the macroscopic ﬁeld

One observes that the classical equation (4) for the rescaled
macroscopic ﬁeld ¯A does not depend on the coupling g. More-
over, all spatial derivatives of ¯A actually vanish. The next

tions [35],

Equations (4) and (7) describe the gauge dynamics up to cor-
rections of order (δA)2 in the ﬂuctuations and to leading order
in the coupling g.

oscillate in time with a characteristic frequency ∼ Q. By mul-
tiplying with g/Q2, the quantities become dimensionless and
independent of the value of g.

Starting from the conﬁguration with a strong color-electric
ﬁeld and vanishing magnetic ﬁeld, one observes that the lat-
ter is subsequently generated. The build-up of the chromo-
magnetic ﬁelds is possible because of the non-linear gauge

the theory. In general, one can write

Ea · Ba = −µνρσ∂µ tr(cid:18)Aν∂ρAσ +
igAνAρAσ(cid:19) . (16)
Therefore, a nonzero Ea · Ba may be obtained even for spa-
tially homogeneous gauge potentials in a nonabelian theory.
The anomaly equation (1) relates Ea · Ba to the four-
divergence of the axial fermion current jµ
5 . For the homoge-
neous system, the spatial divergence drops out for the evalua-
tion of the expectation value of this current. The axial charge
density n5(t) = (cid:104)j0

for zero initial axial charge. The ﬁrst term on the right hand
side arises from the mixing of the different chiral ﬁeld com-
ponents in the presence of a mass. Therefore, in a massless
theory the axial charge density is entirely determined by the
anomalous second term. In particular, to lowest order in the
ﬂuctuations we have (cid:104)Ea · Ba(cid:105) = (cid:104)Ea(cid:105) · (cid:104)Ba(cid:105), and the time
evolution of this term is plotted in Fig. 2. Therefore, in this ap-
proximation our solutions (14) and (15) determine the dynam-
ics of the axial charge generation, and in the massless limit we

which are always non-negative. We ﬁnd that (21) has nega-
tive eigenvalues for 0 < p < 2|A|, with the largest negative
eigenvalue for p(cid:63) = |A| given by −A2. Similarly (22) yields
negative eigenvalues, with the largest for p(cid:63) = (1 +√5)|A|/2
given by −(√5−1)A2/2. Since A ∼ Q, we conclude that the
characteristic growth of ﬂuctuations with momentum p(cid:63) ∼ Q
is described by an exponential behavior with rate γ(cid:63) ∼ Q. In
spatial Fourier space, we therefore ﬁnd for the fastest growing
linear combination of ﬁelds the parametric behavior

(cid:104)δAδA(cid:105)(t, p(cid:63)) ∼ Q

−1 eγ(cid:63)t .

(24)

Next-to-leading order quantum corrections to the leading
weak-coupling behavior of the ﬂuctuation equation (7), both
from gauge-ﬁeld and fermion ﬂuctuations, are proportional
to g2 (see e.g. [26]). Parametrically, these quantum correc-
tions are expected to become relevant once they have grown
enough such that they can compensate for the small factor of
g2. Stated differently, they become relevant at the time tΘ at
which the dimensionless product

g2Q(cid:104)δAδA(cid:105)(t, p(cid:63)) ∼ g2 eγ(cid:63)t

is of order unity, i.e. at the time

−1 log(g

tΘ ∼ Q

(25)

(26)

Before that time, the analytic estimate (18) for the anomalous
charge generation dynamics may also be used to test real-time
lattice simulation techniques that can be applied to more gen-
eral out-of-equilibrium situations.

B. Real-time lattice gauge theory simulations

In this section, we go beyond the linear analysis by conduct-
ing classical-statistical lattice simulations for the pure gauge
theory using standard procedures [39–43], while the lattice
formulation with fermions will be presented in more detail in
section III. To this end, the following initial ﬂuctuations are
added to the coherent ﬁeld initial conditions (11):

FIG. 3. Time-dependence of the axial charge density in the massless
limit, as described by the analytic result (18).

Equation (18) is the central result of this section, which
will be further discussed and used in section III to verify im-
plementations of the axial anomaly in real-time lattice simu-
lations. However, before doing so we have to establish the
solution’s range of validity in time.
In the quantum the-
ory, the ﬂuctuations δAa
i (x) cannot be neglected in general:
i (x)(cid:105) ≡ 0 by deﬁnition,
While the expectation value (cid:104)δAa
the correlation (cid:104)δAa
j(y)(cid:105) cannot vanish identically be-
cause of the uncertainty relation. Starting with large macro-
scopic ﬁelds and all other modes in vacuum, where Q2/g2 ∼
j(y)(cid:105) ∼ Q2 at initial times
(cid:104)Aa
x0 = y0 = 0, we have to investigate on which time scale ﬂuc-
tuations grow to become large enough such that they modify
our result (18).

The initial growth of ﬂuctuations is described by (7), evalu-
ated for the macroscopic ﬁeld conﬁguration (8). Again carry-
ing over the analysis of Ref. [34] to our problem, we consider
a Fourier expansion of the ﬂuctuations and analyze which
momentum modes dominate the growth of ﬂuctuations. For
the employed temporal gauge, the ﬂuctuation equation can be
written as a matrix equation of the form

t (δA) = −Ω2[ ¯A] · (δA) .
∂2

(20)

In fact,
there are negative eigenvalues for Ω2 related to
Nielsen–Olsen type instabilities [37, 38]. In addition, there
are parametric resonance instabilities arising from the oscil-
latory behavior of the macroscopic ﬁeld ¯A(t), which are ex-
pected to be sub-leading according to Ref. [34]. Therefore,
we proceed by computing the most negative eigenvalues of
Ω2 for constant ¯A ∼ Q to determine the characteristic expo-
nential growth rates for ﬂuctuations.
From the three color times three spatial directions, Ω2[ ¯A]
has a 9 × 9 matrix structure. In the spatial momentum space,
its nine eigenvalues depend on momentum p only through its
modulus p = |p|, and they read:

observed.

The non-perturbative lattice simulations take into account

while deviations should occur around tΘ, when higher pow-
ers of δAa
In Fig. 4, we plot the
time-dependence of (cid:104)Ea · Ba(cid:105), which is averaged over space-
coordinates as well as random initial conﬁgurations. At early
times, the effects of the small ﬂuctuations are invisible and the
result are in very good agreement with the analytical solution
that is plotted in Fig. 2. At later times around tΘ, however,
the exponentially growing ﬂuctuations cause decoherence of
the uniform ﬁelds, and thus the ensemble average of Ea · Ba
is diminished signiﬁcantly and approaches zero quickly after-
wards as expected. The number of random initial conﬁgura-
tions used in this computation is Nconf = 128, where we have
checked that sufﬁcient convergence is obtained. The other pa-
rameters used for this computation are g = 10−3, Nlatt = 643
and Qa = 0.312 for lattice spacing a.

Figure 5 shows the axial charge density for the massless
case, which is obtained by integrating the space and ensemble
average of Ea · Ba over time. Again, the early time behav-
ior agrees well with the analytical result (18). Although the
macroscopic color-electric and magnetic ﬁelds approach zero
quickly after a time around tΘ, a non-vanishing axial charge
density is seen to persist for a much longer time after tΘ. This
is possible because the axial charge density is determined by
the integrated time history of (cid:104)Ea · Ba(cid:105). This observation in-
dicates that coherent gauge ﬁelds very efﬁciently produce an
axial charge density at early times, while part of the induced
density persist to be present even well beyond characteristic
decoherence times.

III. TRANSIENT ANOMALOUS CHARGE PRODUCTION:

FERMION SECTOR

A. Axial anomaly with real-time Wilson fermions

In this section, we investigate axial charge generation by
using real-time lattice simulations with Wilson fermions [13,
21, 23–26, 28, 29]. This approach allows us to directly com-
pute quark production and anomalous charge generation at
leading order in the small coupling g (cid:28) 1 for strong gauge
ﬁelds A ∼ Q/g. Consequently, we can use the lattice results
to test the anomaly equation (1) in this far-from-equilibrium
situation by separately computing the fermion and gauge ﬁeld
terms on its left and right hand side.

Starting from a homogeneous ﬁeld conﬁguration accord-
ing to (2), for early times before tΘ the gauge ﬁelds obey the
classical Yang–Mills equations with vanishing color current,
while the fermion ﬁeld is determined through the Dirac equa-
tion in the background SU (2) ﬁeld:

The realization of the axial anomaly on a lattice is non-
trivial. In fact, it is closely related to the lattice fermion dou-
bling problem and the anomaly is recovered by introducing
a regulator term, removing the doubler fermions. As is well
known, from the lattice Dirac equation (30) one can easily
compute the four-divergence of the axial current and obtain an

the chiral symmetry explicitly by introducing a Wilson term,
the axial anomaly is recovered by the continuum limit of this
regulator, as has been studied in detail in Euclidean ﬁeld the-
ory [30–32, 45, 46].

In order to recover the anomaly in real-time simulations,
typically a combination of a spatial Wilson term together with
a suppression of possible temporal doublers using suitable ini-
tial conditions are employed [13, 24]. The Dirac equation with
the spatial Wilson term reads

For the speciﬁc case of a homogeneous background gauge
ﬁeld, one could in principle directly restrict the Brillouin zone
to remove doublers as well, as long as this is done for the co-
variant (kinetic) momentum and hence in a gauge invariant
way.2 We comment on this possibility in the appendix.

Analyzing the anomaly on the lattice, it is helpful to point
out that the relation (17) between the axial charge density,

tensor and the charge current, can also be computed with a cutoff to the
canonical momentum [27].

the time-integral of the pseudo-scalar condensate and of the
anomaly term ∼ (cid:104)Ea · Ba(cid:105) is not realized unless one takes the
continuum limit. However, there exists a modiﬁed equation
that is exactly satisﬁed on the lattice:

emerges for sufﬁciently small lattice spacing. The employed

employed r = 1 for m/Q = 0.1. In fact, in the continuum
limit this result is insensitive to the precise value of r (cid:54)= 0
although r apparently appears in (46) as an overall factor. In
Fig. 7, we show the same Wilson term contribution for differ-
ent values of the Wilson parameter r and ﬁxed lattice spac-

each of its terms. Since the results will depend on the explicit

8

In this work we have investigated the out-of-equilibrium
dynamics of anomalous quark production in two-color QCD.
We have shown that the generation of a nonzero axial charge
density can be described analytically for a class of initial con-
ditions characterized by large coherent gauge ﬁelds motivated
from the Glasma picture. Employing real-time lattice sim-
ulations, we ﬁnd that a transient anomalous charge density
persists in this case even for times signiﬁcantly exceeding
the decoherence time of the macroscopic color-electric and
magnetic ﬁelds. These ﬁndings can be very interesting for
nonequilibrium phenomena such as the chiral magnetic effect
during the very early stages of a relativistic heavy-ion colli-
sion, where ﬁnite-time effects may play a decisive role.

Our combination of analytical and numerical results pro-
vides stringent tests of real-time representations of the axial
anomaly in lattice QCD. We have investigated in detail the
regularization of the fermion doubling problem using a spa-
tial Wilson term. To this end, we considered ﬁrst a modiﬁed
anomaly equation that is exactly fulﬁlled on the lattice, and
discussed the impact of a ﬁnite lattice spacing for computa-
tions of anomalous contributions in the continuum limit. This
allowed us to check the anomaly equation by separately com-
puting the different nonequilibrium fermion and gauge corre-
lation functions entering that equation. In particular, we have
conﬁrmed the insensitivity of the real-time results to the spe-
ciﬁc choice of the Wilson parameter approaching the contin-
uum limit.

The present work provides an important basis for more re-
alistic simulations of anomalous nonequilibrium or transport
processes in QCD related to heavy-ion collisions. Following
along these lines, a wide range of dynamical phenomena can
be addressed with ab initio calculations, from the intriguing
interplay of nonabelian and abelian gauge ﬁelds underlying
the chiral magnetic effect to possible chiral plasma instabili-
ties [47, 48] followed into the far-from-equilibrium regime.

Appendix A: Anomaly derived from analytic solutions of the

Dirac equation

For the speciﬁc case of fermion dynamics in the presence
of homogeneous background gauge ﬁelds considered in sec-
tion III, there is in principle an efﬁcient alternative procedure
to implement the anomaly on the lattice by restricting the Bril-
louin zone to remove doublers [49]. In this appendix, by us-
ing analytic solutions of the Dirac equation for the example of

lytic result (18), which is valid for the massless limit, and the results
of the lattice simulations for different values of the quark mass are
compared. The parameters used for the numerical computations are
Nlatt = 963, Qa = 0.208, and r = 1.

a mass m (cid:54)= 0, we show in Fig. 8 the evolution of the ax-
ial charge density, of the time-integral of the pseudo-scalar
condensate and of the anomaly term for two different masses
m/Q = 0.1 and m/Q = 0.5. The sum of 2m(cid:82) t
0 dt(cid:48)
(cid:104)ψiγ5ψ(cid:105)
and of the anomaly term g2(cid:82) t
0 dt(cid:48)
(cid:104)Ea · Ba(cid:105)/(4π2) is also
shown, since it has to agree to n5 if the anomaly is accurately
represented. The parameters used for these computations are
Nlatt = 963, r = 1 and Qa = 0.208 for m/Q = 0.1, and
Qa = 0.0625 for m/Q = 0.5.

For m/Q = 0.1, one observes from Fig. 8 that the anomaly
term clearly dominates compared to the contributions from the
pseudo-scalar condensate, while for m/Q = 0.5 the pseudo-
scalar term gives a larger contribution. In both cases, we ﬁnd
that the anomaly equation (17) is satisﬁed up to the expected
accuracy for the employed lattice spacings. This provides an
important consistency check for the employed real-time regu-
larization with a spatial Wilson term.

A further veriﬁcation can be obtained from the compari-
son of the numerical lattice results for the axial charge density
with the analytic solution (18). Since the latter is only appli-
cable to the massless case, we perform different lattice simu-
lations with decreasing but nonzero fermion masses in order
to be able to study numerically the approach to the massless
limit. Fig. 9 displays the analytic m = 0 curve along with lat-
tice simulation results for three different values of the fermion
mass: m/Q = 0.2, 0.1 and 0.01. One observes that with
lighter fermion masses the numerical results gets closer to the
analytic curve (18). In fact, Fig. 9 exhibits a remarkably good
agreement of the massless limit and the massive lattice results
already for m/Q = 0.01. This comparison represents a pow-
erful demonstration that the axial anomaly is described by our
real-time lattice simulations to very good accuracy.

is crucial for such a procedure to implement the correspond-
ing momentum cutoff to preserve gauge invariance in order to
describe the anomaly correctly.

(A1)

where e denotes the electromagnetic coupling. In the follow-
ing, we will derive this equation by using analytic solutions
of the Dirac equation in the presence of a homogeneous back-
ground ﬁeld that carries nonzero E· B. As an example of ﬁeld
conﬁgurations with nonzero E · B that are simple enough to
access analytical solutions of the Dirac equation, we consider
a Sauter-type pulsed electric ﬁeld superposed by a constant
magnetic ﬁeld:

where E, B, and the characteristic pulse time τ are constant,
with ez denoting a unit vector in the z-direction. In the fol-
lowing, we assume eE > 0 and eB > 0.

tum is not a gauge-invariant quantity, putting a cutoff breaks
gauge invariance. In order to regularize the integral keeping
the gauge invariance, we need to introduce a cutoff for the
kinetic momentum. Because of the relation (A31), putting a
cutoff ±Λ to the kinetic momentum amounts to putting a time-
dependent cutoff ±Λ + eA3(t) to the canonical momentum:

+∞(cid:90)−∞

dpz −→

+Λ+eA3(t)

(cid:90)−Λ+eA3(t)

dpz .

(A32)

∂tn5 = 2m(cid:104)ψiγ5ψ(cid:105) ,

(A28)

Thanks to this time-dependent cutoff, ∂tn5(t) acquires the
anomaly term:

which so far does not contain the anomaly term.

In the diagrammatic derivation of the axial anomaly, it is
crucial to regularize a divergent integral in a gauge-invariant
way. Also in our calculation, we need to regularize the inte-
gral in (A24) to derive the anomaly. In fact, the integrand of
(A24) does not fall off at pz → ±∞. By using the asymp-
totic expansion of the hypergeometric function 2F1(a, b; c; z)
for large |c| [36], one ﬁnds that

{integrand of (A24)} ≈(cid:40)−1 (pz → +∞)

+1

(pz → −∞).

(A29)

To regularize this divergent integral, one may naively intro-
duce a cutoff for pz as

+∞(cid:90)−∞

dpz −→

+Λ(cid:90)−Λ

dpz

(A30)

to see that this does not alter the result (A28). The reason why
the anomaly term is not obtained is that it introduces the cutoff
for the canonical momentum. The canonical momentum pcan
is related to the kinetic momentum pkin as

pcan = pkin + eA .

(A33)

where we have used Ez = −dA3/dt and (A29).
We have demonstrated how the anomaly term appears from
the gauge-invariant cutoff regularization. However, such a
computation applies only to the speciﬁc case of an abelian
and uniform background gauge ﬁeld. For nonabelian and/or
inhomogeneous gauge ﬁelds, the relation between kinetic and
canonical momentum becomes ambiguous. In that case, the
lattice regularization with the Wilson term method provides
a powerful way to describe the axial anomaly, as discussed
in the main text. Here we note that the derivative appear-
ing in the Wilson term is the covariant derivative, and the
covariant derivative corresponds to the kinetic momentum,
Deipcan·x = ipkineipcan·x.
