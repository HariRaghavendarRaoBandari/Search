Abstract—Transmission expansion planning requires forecasts of
demand for electric power and a model of the underlying physics,
i.e., power ﬂows. We present three approaches to deriving exact
solutions to the transmission expansion planning problem in the
alternating-current model, for a given load.

I. INTRODUCTION

Consider the problem of optimal investment in line capacity,
such that a sum of annualised investment costs and an estimate
of operational costs is minimised. The estimate of operational
costs and its computational complexity depend on the model
of power ﬂows used. Considering the recent progress in the
development of convergent solvers for polynomial optimisa-
tion [1], we explore the options for solving the transmission
expansion problem exactly in the alternating-current model.
This is motivated by the observation [2] that
the quality
of the approximation of the alternating-current model has a
major impact on the investment decisions. Speciﬁcally, the use
of the simplistic direct-current approximation (DCOPF) may
result in no lines being built. Various piece-wise linearisations
may result in various lines being built, other than those built
considering the alternating-current model (ACOPF) proper.
This is the case even when loads are known exactly, i.e.,
independently of the uncertainty in the load.
We compare three convergent approaches to solving the
transmission expansion planning problem in the alternating-
current model. First, we study both the current-voltage (IV)
and power-voltage (PQV) formulations of the problem as
polynomial optimisation problems and derive semideﬁnite-
programming relaxations (SDP) thereof using the techniques
of [1]. Second, we introduce a novel
lift-and-branch-and-
bound procedure using SDP relaxations we introduce, which
makes it possible to obtain global optima for small instances
of the transmission expansion problem. Finally, we compare
these approaches with state-of-the-art piece-wise linearisations
based on the current-voltage formulation and a rudimentary
DCOPF approximation. Although we do not consider multiple
scenarios for the demand, it would be easy to extend the
work in the direction of two-stage or multi-stage stochastic
programming.

II. THE PROBLEM

Formally, let introduce the problem using:

with buses N and lines A

• (N ,A) be the graph representing an electrical network
• pi + jqi be the complex net power injection at bus i ∈ N ,
• zi +jwi be the complex net current injected at bus i ∈ N ,
• zij + jwij be the complex current ﬂow on line (i, j) ∈ A
• vi + jui be the complex voltage at bus i ∈ N and
• oij = 1 if circuit (i, j) ∈ A is open and 0 otherwise.

(with slight abuse of notation), and let

III. A PIECE-WISE LINEARISATION

Several authors have proposed piece-wise linearisations of the
current-voltage formulation of optimal power ﬂows (ACOPF-
IV) and related problems, which yield mixed-integer linear
programming formulations [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. The idea of
piece-wise linearisation is well-known and often very efﬁcient.
Most of the proposed piece-wise linearisations, e.g. [4], [2],
[7], however, cannot reach the global optimum in the limit
of the number of segments, due to the additional assumptions
surveyed in Table 1 of [7]. In the following, we extend the
formulation proposed in [6] to accommodate dispatch of real
and reactive power, and hence obtain a “principled” piece-wise
linearisation.
The upper bound on voltage magnitude in (5) are convex
quadratic constraints, that may be replaced by an outer linear
approximation as in [5]. The remaining non-linear constraints
(3), (4), and the ﬁrst inequality of (5) is discussed below.
In general, the complex current injection may be written in
terms of voltage and power as

I = z + jw =

S
V

=

p + jq
v + ju

=

vp + uq
v2 + u2

+ j

vq − up
v2 + u2

By employing a discretisation of the complex two-dimensional
(V, S)-space, we can linearise the complex current injection.
We propose to discretise the complex voltage space V along
its polar coordinates, while discretising the power along rect-
angular coordinates. This ensures a tight approximation to the
feasible area of the voltage space. Let ˆ|V |, ˆθ, ˆp, and ˆq be
the vectors of values at the discretisation points in the four
real dimensions, voltage magnitude, voltage angle, real, and
reactive power, respectively. We then evaluate the value of
the current injection in each of the | ˆ|V || × |ˆθ| × |ˆp| × |ˆq|
discretisation points as ˆz + j ˆw.
Now, at any point in the (|V |, θ, p, q)-space we can approxi-
mate all relevant quantities as a convex combination λ of the
values in the immediately surrounding discretisation points.

The so called “special ordered set of type 2” (SOS2) con-
straints ensures that we choose a combination of the two
closest discretisation points in each dimension:

λjklm ≤ ψj−1 + ψj,∀j ∈ J \ {0}
λjklm ≤ χk−1 + χk,∀k ∈ K \ {0}
λjklm ≤ ϕl−1 + ϕl,∀l ∈ Ł \ {0}

where J ,K, Ł, and M are the index sets of the discretisation
points ˆ|V |, ˆθ, and ˆp ˆq, respectively. That is,

• υm = 1 if and only if q is in the interval(cid:2)ˆqm, ˆqm+1(cid:3).

• ψj = 1 if and only if V is in the interval
• χk = 1 if and only if θ is in the interval

,

,

For the reference bus, the voltage is ﬁxed and only the two
dimensional real (p, q)-space is discretised, while for demand
buses without generation, power is ﬁxed and only the voltage
space is discretised.
We can model line-use by introducing the binary variable
oij = 1 if and only if the line (i, j) is not available,
i.e. not installed or the switch is open. That is, we replace
the implications (7–10) by the disjunctive constraints:

−M oij ≤ Rijzij − Xijwij + vj − vi ≤ M oij ∀(i, j) ∈ A
(11)
−M oij ≤ Xijzij + Rijwij + uj − ui ≤ M oij ∀(i, j) ∈ A
(12)
ij(1 − oij) ∀(i, j) ∈ A
(13)

ij ≤ ¯z2

z2
ij + w2

In summary, a “principled” piece-wise linearisation converges
to the true optimum in the large limit of the number of evalua-
tion points, in theory. This comes at the price of discretisation
of the two-dimensional (V, S)-space, where we discretise the
complex voltage space V along its polar coordinates, while
discretising the power along rectangular coordinates, which
seems superior to the alternative choices of discretisation.

IV. SUM-OF-SQUARES APPROACHES

Alternatively, one can exploit a rich history of research into
polynomial optimisation:

min f (x)

s.t. gi(x) ≥ 0

i = {1, . . . , m}

h(x) =(cid:80)k

[PP]
as surveyed in [8] and elsewhere. Let us use Pd(S) to denote
the cone of polynomials of degree at most d that are non-
negative over some S ⊆ Rn. A homogeneous polynomial
h(x) of degree 2d in n-dimensional vector x is sum-of-
squares (SOS, [9]) if and only if there exist homogeneous
polynomials of degree d, denoted g1(x), . . . , gk(x) such that
i=1 gi(x)2. for conductance, as usual in the power
systems community.) We use Σd to denote the cone of
polynomials of degree at most d that are sum-of-squares of
polynomials. It has been shown [9] that each P2d(Rn) can
be approximated as closely as desired by a sum-of-squares
of polynomials, in the l1-norm of its coefﬁcient vector, albeit
with a possibly large k. Using G = {gi(x) : i = 1, . . . , m}
and denoting SG = {x ∈ Rn : g(x) ≥ 0, ∀g ∈ G} the basic
closed semi-algebraic set deﬁned by G, Lasserre reformulates
[PP] as

max ϕ

= max ϕ

s.t. f (x) − ϕ ≥ 0 ∀ x ∈ SG,
s.t. f (x) − ϕ ∈ Pd(SG).

[PP-D]

which allows for approximations up to arbitrary accuracy
within a number of hierarchies [10], [11].
The so called “dense” hierarchy of Lasserre [10] approximates
Pd(SG) by the cone KrG, where
m(cid:88)

gi(x)Σr−deg(gi),

(14)

KrG = Σr +

and r ≥ d. The corresponding optimisation problem over S
can be written as:

i=1

max
ϕ,σi(x)

ϕ

s.t. f (x) − ϕ = σ0(x) +

[PP-Hr]∗

m(cid:88)

σi(x)gi(x)

σ0(x) ∈ Σr, σi(x) ∈ Σr−deg(gi).

i=1

and [PP-Hr]∗ can be reformulated as a semideﬁnite optimi-
sation problem. We denote the dual of [PP-Hr]∗ by [PP-Hr],
in keeping with previous work [1].
The so called “sparse” hierarchy of Waki et al. [12], [11],
[13] is based on the correlative sparsity of a polynomial
optimisation problem [PP] of dimension n, which can be
represented by the n × n correlative sparsity pattern matrix:

Rij =

for xi, xj in the same constraint gk
otherwise,

and its associated adjacency graph G, the correlative sparsity
pattern graph. Let {Ik}p
k=1 be the set of maximal cliques of
a chordal extension of G following the construction in [12],
i.e. Ik ⊂ {1, . . . , n}. The sparse approximation of Pd(S) is
KrG(I), given by
p(cid:88)

Σr(Ik) +

gjΣr−deg(gj )(Ik)

 ,

KrG(I) =

(cid:88)

j∈Jk

k=1

where Σd(Ik) is the set of all sum-of-squares polynomials
of degree up to d supported on Ik and (J1, . . . , Jp) is a
partitioning of the set of polynomials {gj}j deﬁning S such
that for every j in Jk, the corresponding gj is supported on
Ik. The support I ⊂ {1, . . . , n} of a polynomial contains the
indices i of terms xi which occur in one of the monomials
of the polynomial. The sparse hierarchy of SDP relaxations is
then given by

max

ϕ,σk(x),σr,k(x)

ϕ

s.t. f (x) − ϕ =

σk(x) +

p(cid:88)

(cid:88)

j∈Jk

[PP-SHr]∗



gj(x)σj,k(x)

σk ∈ Σr((Ik)), σj,k ∈ Σr−deg(gj )(Ik).

We denote the dual of [PP-SHr]∗ by [PP-SHr], again in
keeping with previous work [1].
One can easily see the current-voltage (IV) formulation ([IV]–
10) as a polynomial optimisation problem: one only needs
to reformulate the constraints on line-use variable oij
to
ij = oij and the implication with antecedent oij = 0 using
o2
either “Big M” constraints or perspective reformulation [14].
Subsequently, one can derive two hierarchies of semideﬁnite
programming relaxations, as described above. While these
relaxations of the degree-2 polynomial optimisation problem
are tractable, they also turn out to be rather weak.
One may also consider the power-voltage (PQV) formulation,
where variables are complex voltages V at each bus and power
at each generator. With matrices Yk, Yij, ¯Yk, ¯Yij derived from
the admittance matrix in the usual fashion [1], and without
the line-use decision, the PQV formulation of optimal power
ﬂows is a polynomial optimisation problem of degree 2 or
4. The line-use decision oij = 0 in the antecedent of the
implications of the investment problem, however, requires
replacing constant matrices with variables such as,

if i (cid:54)= j, (i, j) ∈ A
if i (cid:54)= j, (i, j) (cid:54)∈ A

,

(15)

For the thermal limits, one would hence have to introduce:

(tr(Y(o)YijVV T ))2 + (tr(Y(o) ¯YijVV T ))2

which raises the degree of the polynomial optimisation prob-
lem to 9. This produces a strong relaxation, albeit hard to use
with general-purpose polynomial optimisation techniques.

V. LIFT-AND-BRANCH-AND-BOUND

Finally, we present a lift-and-branch-and-bound scheme. Sim-
ilarly to branch-and-bound approaches [15] in mixed-integer
linear programming (MILP), we consider repeatedly a sub-
problem, where values of certain variables oij are ﬁxed to
either 0 or 1. We denote the set of constraints ﬁxing these
variables to the prescribed values by E. Outside of variables
ij = oij are relaxed to 0 ≤ oij ≤ 1
ﬁxed in E, constraints o2
in either the IV or PQV formulation above, which are made
progressively tighter in a newly introduced outer loop. We
denote such a sub-problem by [Relaxation-SHr(E)], where
Relaxation is either PQV or IV and r is the counter of the
outer loop, i.e., the order of the relaxation.
The pseudo-code of the algorithm is displayed in Algorithm
Schema 1. Initially, one considers the so called “root relax-
ation”, where E = ∅. Counter r is initialised to the minimum
required by either [PQV-SHr(E)] or [IV-SHr(E)]. A queue Q
stores subproblems, which deﬁne a partial or complete solution
in terms of the investment decision. While processing E ∈ Q,
we may arrive at one of the four outcomes:

• a feasible solution is found
• infeasibility or a bound sufﬁciently strong to prune E is

found,

• if there is a variable oij, whose value is not ﬁxed, Q is
• processing is deferred to Q(cid:48).

extended with branches oij = 0/1

Speciﬁcally, if the set of constraints deﬁne a complete solution
in terms of the investment decision oij, the processing con-
siders [PP2-SHr] of Ghaddar et al. [1]. Alternatively, starting
on Line 21, we consider [Relaxation-SHr(E)]. Once there are
no elements left in Q, we move the contents of Q(cid:48) into Q,
increment r, and repeat. The hope is that we prune as many
subproblems as possible using low-rank relaxations, so as to
process fewer nodes for higher values of counter r.

VI. COMPUTATIONAL ILLUSTRATIONS

We have evaluated the approaches on variants of a simple
two-bus instance [17] and variants of Garver’s [18] six-bus
network. Throughout, e.g. in Table IV below, we detail:

• Obj: the sum of the per-hour costs of operations with the

per-hour amortisation of the investment in US dollars

the same. Wherever applicable, global optimality has been
certiﬁed by the rank of the solution of the SDP relaxation,
as per [21], [20].

A. Case2

Our computational experiments start with a 2-bus instance
by Bukhsh et al. [17], where one can invest into one line,
with r = 0.04 and x = 0.2. Trivially, there is 1 feasible
conﬁguration. First, we observe that both the Lavaei-Low
relaxation (for ACOPF) and the lowest orders of both IV and
PQV relaxations (for TEP) fail to ﬁnd the global optimum,
although PQV at r = 5 gets close. Second, considering
a degree-9 polynomial is involved in the PQV formulation,
solving the relaxation with r = 5 requires circa 20 GB of
RAM. Further, we observe that the use of o2
ij = oij and similar
does not improve the relaxation considerably. Even this trivial
instance hence suggests that there are substantial limitations
to the performance of the relaxations.
We have also introduced a 2-bus test instance (case2mod),
where there are no existing lines, 2 parallel lines one can invest
into, and hence 4 possible conﬁgurations. The two parallel
lines between buses 1 and 2 differ in their admittance. The

LINEARISATIONS FOR CASE2 AND CASE2MOD.

ﬁrst one has r = 0.04 and x = 0.2, while the second one
has r = 0.02 and x = 0.1. Both crude and ﬁne piece-
wise linearisations, the interior point method implemented in
Matpower [19], and the SDP relaxation of Lavaei and Low
[20], [21] fail to ﬁnd the global optimum. When one adds the
investment decision, the relaxation grow very quickly.
Speciﬁcally, the size of the constraint matrix for case2mod as
an investment problem grows from 513×3311 with 3449 non-
zeros for the ﬁrst order, which can be solved in 7.5 seconds,
to 16905 × 163506 (183646 non-zeros) for the second order,
which requires 4655.8 seconds, and beyond. It is not known
how high in the hierarchy one would need to go to obtain
the exact solution to the investment problem. Compare this to
138× 331 matrix with 624 for the usual PQV SDP relaxation
of Lavaei-Low [21], [20], which can be solved in 1.65 seconds,
but remains a challenge to extend to the investment decision.
We will provide the details in an extended version of the paper.

B. Garver6y

Next, we have introduced a small test instance based on the
one by Garver [18]. As in Garver’s original example we
consider the connection of bus 6 to the existing system. For
the sake of clarity, we consider three double circuit lines 2-6,
3-6, and 4-6, and hence 8 possible conﬁgurations. The existing
lines are complemented by an extra circuit along line 1-5
and 3-5 and the corresponding lines are replaced by their
equivalent single circuit line. The network conﬁguration is
shown in Figure 1. Line investment costs, loosely based on
amortisation to a per-hour cost assuming a 40-year planning
period and an interest rate of 3 %, are 100, 80, and 50 for the
lines 2–6, 3–6, and 4–6, respectively. See Table II for details.
Table III provides an overview of the 8 conﬁgurations. We
label
the conﬁgurations 000 to 111, where the ﬁrst-listed
binary digit indicates whether line 2 → 6 is built, the second-
listed binary digit indicates whether the line 3 → 6 is built,
and the third-listed binary digit indicates whether 4 → 6
is built. Conﬁgurations 000 and 010 are both AC and DC
infeasible. A DC model considers conﬁguration 001 feasible
with cost 1840, 100 feasible with cost 1840, 110 feasible
with cost 1412, and 011 feasible with cost 1360. Neither of
those is AC feasible, though. The remaining two conﬁgurations
are AC feasible, as detailed in Table IV, but the piece-wise
linearisation gives rather different solution from the exact
optimum recovered by the SDP relaxation. Notably, the DC
model would result in a different investment decision from
the crude piece-wise linearisation, which would be different
still from the decision made using either the interior-point

method or the semideﬁnite programming, which both produce
the globally optimal solution, in this case.
Next, we illustrate the error in the piece-wise linearisations on
Conﬁguration 101 of Garver6y in Figure 2. On the horizontal
axis, we plot the number of segments used for the piece-
wise linearisation of the voltage angle per each 90 degrees.
On the vertical axis, we plot the RMSE of the solution of
the corresponding piece-wise linearised instance in terms of
voltages. For the remaining three dimensions,
i.e. voltage
magnitude, active-, and reactive power injections, we use
piece-wise linearisations with uniformly 1, 2, or 3 pieces, and
obtain the blue, green, and red curves in the plot, respectively.
The evolution of RMSE over the number of segments seems
disappointing. (It should not be expected to decrease mono-
tonically, though: for the example of a feasible set comprising
a disk in 2D, a particular rotation of a square yields 0 error for
any objective function parallel to an axis, while no rotation of

a pentagon yields the same.) The evolution of run-time over
the number of segments is more disappointing, still: While
the piece-wise linearisation with three segments across all
dimensions takes 2.20 seconds to solve using CPLEX 12.5
with default parameters, the piece-wise linearisations with 4,
8, 12, and 16 segments across voltage angle and three segments
elsewhere take 3.82, 10.41, 23.84, and 96.45 seconds to solve.
Notice that this is a single conﬁguration of a 6-bus instance,
rather than the investment problem propers.
Finally, the performance of the lift-and-branch-and-bound pro-
cedure is somewhat promising. Even a simple, preliminary
implementation traverses a tree of 15 subproblems in 59873
seconds using SeDuMi, the SDP solver. We envision this could
be sped up much further.

TABLE IV. THE TWO AC-FEASIBLE CONFIGURATIONS OF FIGURE 1.

The ﬁrst results obtained with the lift-and-branch-and-bound
method give some indication on how to make approaches
based on polynomial optimisation applicable to investment
planning in power systems, which involves both, discrete
decisions and accurate models of the non-convex power ﬂow in
the constraints. If this approach proves to be scalable for larger
instances, it may potentially be applied to investment planning
problems beyond power systems, where there is a combined
challenge of discrete investment decisions, continuous opera-
tional decisions and non-convex system dynamics, such as in
gas and water network optimisation or in trafﬁc management.
We conjecture that the lift-and-branch-and-bound method has
ﬁnite convergence for a large class of instances, although we
do not prove so in this paper, and envision much further
research focussed on it.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

Whereas in the operations of power systems, piece-wise lin-
earisations may soon be replaced by convex relaxations [21],
[20], [1], the outlook remains less clear within investment
planning. Although polynomial optimisation allows for global
optimisation in power systems with accurate models for the
physics, it remains a challenge to develop solvers that would
scale to realistic instances, especially considering multiple
scenarios. Considering also that the Lavaei-Low relaxation
seems difﬁcult to extend to the investment decisions, one can
hardly enumerate all the possible conﬁgurations and test them
with an interior-point method, and the scalability of the piece-
wise linearisations is also limited, it seems worth studying the
polynomial optimisation approach in more detail.
