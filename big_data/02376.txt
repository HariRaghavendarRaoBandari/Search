We construct a potential obtained by one-pion exchange for the coupled channel Σ∗

¯D-Σc ¯D∗, and
solve the coupled Schr¨odinger equations to determine the binding energy. We ﬁnd that there exists
one or two bound states with the binding energy of several MeV below the threshold of Σ∗
c and ¯D,
dominantly made from a Σ∗
c baryon and a ¯D meson, with the size of about 1.5 fm for wide parameter
region. We also study the pentaquark states including a b quark and/or an anti-b quark. We show
that there exist pentaquarks including c¯b, b¯c and b¯b, all of which lie at about 10 MeV below the
corresponding threshold and have size of about 1.5 fm.

INTRODUCTION

Hadrons made of more than three quarks are inter-
esting objects to study.
In the summer of 2015, the
LHCb announced the discovery of the hidden charm pen-
taquark [1]: one has a mass of 4380 ± 8 ± 29 MeV and a
width of 205 ± 18 ± 86 MeV, while the second is nar-
rower, with a mass of 4449.8 ± 1.7 ± 2.5 MeV and a
width of 39± 5± 19 MeV. Soon after the announcement,
there appeared many theoretical analyses on the pen-
taquark based on the molecular picture [2–16], the re-
scattering eﬀects [17–20], the diquark-diquark-antiquark
(or diquark-triquark) picture [21–32], and so on [33–47],
in addition to some relevant works [48–53] done before
the LHCb result.

There are many analyses for the molecule picture. In
Ref. [2], the pentaquarks are regarded as the bound states
of the ¯D∗ meson and the Σc baryon by using the poten-
tial made by the one pion exchange. The contributions
from the σ and ω mesons are further included in the po-
tential [3], which shows that Pc(4380) can be understood
as a bound state of Σ∗
c and ¯D. In Ref. [4], the QCD sum
rule is used to show that Pc(4380) is a bound state of
Σc and ¯D∗, and that Pc(4450) is a bound state of a mix-
ture of Λc ¯D∗ and Σ∗
¯D. An analysis based on a quark
model was performed [50] before the LHCb result, which
showed that there exists a bound state of Σc and ¯D with
the threshold being about 4.3 GeV. There are many other
analyses such as those in Refs. [5–7, 9–12, 14, 15] showing
several diﬀerent molecule structures.

The recently observed Pc(4380) lies below the Σ∗

¯D
threshold in several MeV, so that this new state can be
naturally regarded as a molecular state of Σ∗
¯D. However,
it is impossible to construct a Σ∗
¯D molecular state by a
potential made by just one-pion exchange because ¯D ¯Dπ
vertex is prohibited by the parity invariance. Then, we
need to take into account eﬀects of coupled channels to
study the existence of the molecular state mainly made
from Σ∗
¯D by the one-pion exchange. Thus in this paper,

¯D-Σc ¯D∗
we investigate the coupled channel eﬀect of Σ∗
to molecular states. As pointed in recent review arti-
cle [54], this coupled channel eﬀect was not yet studied.
In the present analysis, we construct a one-pion exchange
potential following the procedure explained in Ref. [60],
and solve the equation of motion of Schr¨odinger type.
Our results show that the binding energy of the ground
state is about several MeV below the sum of Σ∗
c and ¯D
masses of 4385.3 MeV in the wide range of the relevant
parameters, and that the percentage of the Σ∗
¯D compo-
nent is more than 99%. This implies that the observed
Pc(4380) can be reasonably understood as a molecular
state dominantly made from the Σ∗
c baryon and the ¯D
meson.

This paper is organized as follows.

In section II we
construct a potential by one-pion exchange. Then, we
make a numerical analysis in section III. We extend the
analysis by replacing the charm quark with the bottom
quark in section IV. Finally, a summary and discussions
are given in section V.

II. ONE PION EXCHANGE POTENTIAL FOR

c

¯D-Σc ¯D∗ CHANNELS

In this section, we construct a potential for Σ∗

channels generated by one-pion exchange.

¯D-Σc ¯D∗

c

Here, we ﬁrst specify interactions of relevant hadrons
with the pions based on the heavy quark symmetry and
the chiral symmetry. The pion ﬁeld is introduced into
our model within the framework of the chiral Lagrangian
based on the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of
SU(2)R × SU(2)L → SU(2)V. The basic quantity is

(cid:2)∂µξ · ξ† − ∂µξ† · ξ(cid:3) ,

α⊥µ =

1
2i

(1)

where ξ = eiπ/fπ with π = πaTa (a = 1, 2, 3) and
fπ = 92.4 MeV being the pion ﬁelds and the pion decay
constant. The quantity α⊥µ transforms as

α⊥µ → h α⊥µ h† ,

(2)

where h is an element of SU(2)V.

2

We include the ¯D and ¯D∗ ﬁelds through the standard

heavy meson eﬀective ﬁeld expressed as

¯H =(cid:2) ¯D∗µγµ − ¯Dγ5

(cid:3) 1 + v/

2

,

(3)

where vµ denotes the velocity of the heavy meson, ¯D
and ¯D∗ are the iso-doublet ﬁelds for the ﬂuctuation of
the heavy mesons, ¯D+,0 and ¯D∗+,0. Under the chiral
transformation, ¯H transforms as
¯H → h ¯H .

(4)

By using this together with α⊥µ for the pion ﬁelds, an
interaction for heavy mesons with pions with least deriva-
tives is written as [56–58]

Lint = gTr(cid:2)Hγµγ5αµ⊥ ¯H(cid:3) ,

(5)

where g is a dimensionless coupling constant. Expanding
the H ﬁelds and α⊥µ, the one-pion interaction terms of
the heavy mesons are expressed as

for the meson-pion vertex may not be the same with that
for the baryon-pion vertex, we use the same parameter
in the present analysis for simplicity. By including this

Solving the above Schr¨odinger equation, we determine
the binding energy of the bound states and the mix-
ing structure. We use mπ=137.2MeV, mΣc=2453.5MeV,
mΣ∗
=2518.1MeV, m ¯D=1867.2MeV, m ¯D∗ =2008.6MeV
for hadron masses. For the coupling constant among
one pion and the charmed mesons g deﬁned in Eq. (5),
we use |g| = 0.60 determined from the D∗ → Dπ decay
width [61]. For the one-pion coupling of charmed baryons
g1 deﬁned in Eq. (10), we take g1 = 0.95 as an example
which is close to the value 0.94 estimated in a quark
model [59], and study the dependence by using g1 = 0.75
and 1.95. We also vary the value of the cutoﬀ parameter
Λ for the form factor from 0.8 GeV to 2.5 GeV.

We ﬁrst

show r dependences of

two potentials
VΣc ¯D∗−Σ∗
¯D(r) and VΣc ¯D∗−Σc ¯D∗ (r) in Fig. 1 for several
choices of the cutoﬀ parameter Λ with ﬁxed value of
g1 = 0.95 as an example.

From Figs. 2-4 together with Fig. 5, we can see the
following properties: There are bound states with the

plotted against the cutoﬀ Λ. The values of the percentage for

stable since the reduced mass is unchanged. Therefore,
when the Λ reaches a certain value, the potential energy
exceed the value for which the ﬁrst excited state can ex-
ist. Then, there is a jump of three quantities.
From the above analysis, we conclude that there is one
or two bound states in the coupled channel of Σ∗
¯D and
Σc ¯D∗ with the binding energy of several MeV and the
size of about 1.5 fm dominantly made from a Σ∗
c baryon
and a ¯D meson. Since the sum of the masses of Σ∗
c and
¯D is 4385.3 MeV, and the observed mass of Pc(4380) is
4380 ± 8 ± 29 MeV, then the obtained binding energy is
just suitable for considering Pc(4380) as a molecular state
existing in the coupled channel of Σc ¯D∗-Σ∗
¯D. Further-
more, for some parameter region, there exist two molec-
ular states within a few MeV range.

IV. PENTAQUARKS INCLUDING A b QUARK

AND/OR A ¯b QUARK

b Σ∗

b Σbπ = gΣ∗

b Σ∗

In this section, we extend our analysis in the previ-
ous section to pentaquarks including a b quark and/or
a ¯b quark. As in the case of the charmed baryons and
mesons, we use the heavy-quark spin symmetry to relate
the B∗Bπ coupling to B∗B∗π coupling as well as the
Σ∗
b Σbπ coupling to the Σ∗
b π coupling. The heavy-quark
ﬂavor symmetry further relates these couplings to the
ones for the charmed hadrons. Then, in the present anal-
ysis, we ﬁx |gB∗Bπ| = |gB∗B∗π| = |gD∗Dπ| = |gD∗D∗π| =
0.60, and vary the value of gΣ∗
b π from 0.75 to
1.95. As in the previous section, we introduce one com-
mon cutoﬀ parameter Λ for two form factors, and study
the dependence of the results.
We ﬁrst study the molecular state in the coupled chan-
nel of ΣbB∗-Σ∗
b B, using mΣb = 5813.4 MeV, mΣ∗
=
5833.6MeV, mB = 5279.4 MeV, mB∗ = 5324.8 MeV. In
Fig. 6, we show the binding energy measured from Σ∗
b B
threshold of 11113.0 MeV, together with the percentage
of the Σ∗
b B component and the mean square radius. This
shows that the values of the binding energy are larger
than those for Σc ¯D∗-Σ∗
¯D molecular state. The percent-
age of Σ∗
b B component is slightly smaller for some pa-
rameter range, but still more than 99% in most region.
The value of mean square radius takes about 1.5-1.7 fm,
some of which are slightly larger than those for Σc ¯D∗-
Σ∗
¯D molecular state. Our results summarized in Fig. 6
indicate that there exists a hidden bottom pentaquark
with the mass of about 11080-11110 MeV and the quan-
tum number of J P = 3
. Furthermore, similarly to the
2
case for Pc(4380), there may exist two or three molecular
states within a few 10 MeV range.
We next study the molecular states in the coupled
channel of ΣcB∗-Σ∗
¯D, which
carry the pure exotic ﬂavor quantum numbers. In Figs. 7
and 8, we show the resultant values of the binding energy,
the mixing structure and the mean square radius. These
show that there exist molecular states several MeV be-
low the thresholds, dominantly made from Σ∗
c B,

c B, and that of Σb ¯D∗-Σ∗

binding energy of several MeV dominantly (more than
99%) made from Σ∗
¯D with the size of about 1.5 fm in
wide parameter range. Inside a bound state the distance
between Σ∗
c and ¯D components is about 1 fm, which im-
plies that it is naturally regarded as a molecule state. The
binding energy and the MSR are rather stable against
the change of Λ in most region, while the percentage
slightly decreases with increasing Λ. When the value of
Λ is increased with a ﬁxed value of g1, three quantities of
the ground state shown by solid curves suddenly change
their values at a certain cutoﬀ, e.g. at Λ = 2200 MeV for
g1 = 0.95, the binding energy jumps from E ∼ 1.5 MeV
to 4 MeV. But the values before the jump are smoothly
connected to those of the ﬁrst excited states drawn by
dashed curves. As a result, there are two bound states
for the large values of the cutoﬀ Λ and/or the coupling
g1. We can understand these properties as follows: The
binding energy and the size (MSR) are determined by
the shape of the potential and the kinetic energy. When
the cutoﬀ Λ is increased, the shape of the potential is
changed, i.e., the depth becomes deep. On the other
hand, the kinetic energy by the quantum ﬂuctuation is

with the size of about 1.5 fm.

The results for the binding energy in Figs. 6-8 com-
bined with those in Fig. 2 indicate that the binding en-
ergy is larger for the bound state including heavier com-
ponents. However, the binding energy cannot keep grow-
ing with increasing reduced mass, since the depth of the
potential is ﬁxed by the values of the cutoﬀ Λ and the
coupling g1. Then, the binding energy is expected to
be saturated to a certain value with increasing reduced
mass. To check this, we show the dependence of the
binding energy on the reduced mass with ﬁxed values of
the cutoﬀ Λ = 1600 MeV in Fig. 9. This shows that the
binding energy is actually saturated at a certain value of

V. A SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

We investigated the coupled channel eﬀect of Σ∗

¯D-
Σc ¯D∗ to the molecular states. We constructed a one-
pion exchange potential
following the procedure ex-
plained in Ref. [60], and solved the equation of motion of
Schr¨odinger type. Our results showed that the binding
energy of the ground state is about several MeV below
the threshold of Σ∗
¯D, 4385.3 MeV, in wide range of the
cutoﬀ Λ for the form factor and the unknown coupling

constant of Σ∗
c Σcπ. Furthermore, for some parameter re-
gion, there exist two molecular states within a few MeV
range. We also studied the size and the mixing structure
of the molecular states. We found that the size of the
molecule is about 1.5 fm and the percentage of the Σ∗
¯D
component is more than 99%. These results indicate that
the observed Pc(4380) can be reasonably understood as
a loosely bound molecular state dominantly made from
the Σ∗
c baryon and the ¯D meson. We would like to stress
that the Σ∗
c baryon and the ¯D meson can form a molec-

c

ular state mediated by one pion exchange because the
coupled channel eﬀects are included.

We further extended our analysis to the pentaquarks
including a b quark and/or an anti-b quark. Our results
showed that there exists a loosely bound molecular state
dominantly made from one of (Σ∗
b ) baryons and one of
( ¯D, B) mesons, and that the size is always about 1.5 fm.
We expect that the existence of these pentaquarks will
be tested in future experiments.

c , Σ∗

In the present analysis, we focus on the S-wave bound
states, and we do not include the eﬀects of the tensor
force by the one-pion exchange. We expect that inclusion
of the tensor force by considering the mixing to the D-
wave states makes the binding energy larger. In addition,
inclusion of other channels may modify the properties of
the bound states.
The present analysis can be extended to the P -wave
¯D-Σc ¯D∗ channel which can be ex-
and F -wave state of Σ∗
pected to give some explanations of the recently observed
Pc(4450). In this case, Pc(4450) can be regarded as the
Feshbach resonance state since the mass of Pc(4450) is
greater than the value of Σ∗
¯D threshold and smaller than
that of Σc ¯D∗ threshold.

c

c

It will be also very interesting to study the decays of
the molecular states obtained in this analysis by calculat-
ing the overlap of the wave function with the component
states.

We leave the above analyses in future publications.
