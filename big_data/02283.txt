Abstract

One interesting feature of 3d N = 2 theories is that gauge-invariant operators can decou-
ple by strong-coupling eﬀects, leading to emergent ﬂavor symmetries in the IR. The details
of such decoupling, however, depends very delicately on the gauge group and matter content
of the theory. We here systematically study the IR behavior of 3d N = 2 SQCD with Nf
ﬂavors, for gauge groups SU(Nc), USp(2Nc) and SO(Nc). We apply a combination of analyt-
ical and numerical methods, both to small values of Nc, Nf and also to the Veneziano limit,
where Nc and Nf are taken to be large with their ratio Nf /Nc ﬁxed. We highlight the role
of the monopole operators and the interplay with Aharony-type dualities. We also discuss
the eﬀect of gauging continuous as well as discrete ﬂavor symmetries, and the implications
of our analysis to the classiﬁcation of 1/4–BPS co-dimension 2 defects of 6d (2, 0) theories.

Introduction and Summary

In this paper we study three-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories [1, 2]. Since
the gauge coupling is dimensionful in three spacetime dimensions, we expect that generic

three-dimensional gauge theories become strongly-coupled in the deep IR (infrared), where
the non-perturbative eﬀects play prominent roles. For example, in three-dimensional N = 2
pure SU(Nc) super Yang-Mills theory non-perturbative instanton eﬀects generate a super-
potential term, which lifts the supersymmetric vacuum [3].

One interesting feature of the IR behavior of 3d N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories
is that there are often indications that strong-coupling eﬀects make some operators free,

and decouple those from the rest of the system, in the IR. In this case we need to subtract

the corresponding degrees of freedom to discuss truly strongly-coupled interacting dynamics.

This also means that there are emergent U(1) ﬂavor symmetries in the IR, which act only

on that decoupled ﬁelds.

That some operators could decouple in the IR is known also in four dimensions, e.g. from
the analysis of the 4d N = 1 adjoint QCD [4, 5]. The story is, however, even richer in the
three-dimensional counterparts discussed in this paper. This is because in three dimensions

we have monopole operators (constructed out of dual photons), which are new sources for

possible IR decouplings. Indeed, we will see below a strong evidence that such a decoupling
of monopole operators do happen for 3d N = 2 SU(Nc) gauge theory with Nf ﬂavors, for
inﬁnitely many values of Nc and Nf (see [6] for a similar analysis for U(Nc) gauge groups,
which provided an inspiration for this paper). This is in contrast with their 4d N = 1
counterparts, which show no sign of such decouplings.

One useful signal of the IR decoupling of operators is the unitarity bound [7–10] (see
[11, 12] for recent discussion). In 3d N = 4 theories there is a simple formula for the scaling
dimensions of the monopole operators [13], which lead to the good/ugly/bad classiﬁcations
of 3d N = 4 theories [14]. More concretely, the absence of the IR decouplings for U(Nc) 3d
N = 4 SQCD (Supersymmetric QCD) with Nf ﬂavors require a simple inequality Nf > 2Nc.
One natural question is then what happens to the case of reduced supersymmetry, i.e. 3d
N = 2 supersymmetry. In this paper we study 3d N = 2 SQCD with Nf ﬂavors.1 In this
case, the conformal dimension of a chiral primary operator (such as the monopole operator) is

determined by its R-charge. The complication is that the UV (ultraviolet) U(1) R-symmetry

1In this paper we only discuss parity-preserving theories, and in particular we do not discuss theories
with Chern-Simons terms. The Chern-Simons terms renders the monopole operator to be gauge variant,
which signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the discussion below, as already commented in [6].

could mix in the IR with ﬂavor U(1) symmetries, hence the IR U(1) R-symmetry in the IR

superconformal algebra is in general diﬀerent from the UV R-symmetry.

The correct IR R-symmetry can be determined with the help of the F -maximization [15],

i.e. the maximization of the supersymmetric partition function on the round three-sphere
S3 [15–17]. However, the S3 partition function is a complicated integral expression, an

evaluation of which often requires numerical analysis, and it turns out that whether or

not the IR decoupling happens or not depends very sensitively on the choice of the gauge

groups and the matter contents of the theory. For this reason we consider SQCD with various

diﬀerent gauge groups, SU(Nc), USp(2Nc) and SO(Nc), with Nf ﬂavors, with diﬀerent values
of Nc and Nf . Our analysis simpliﬁes somewhat in the Veneziano limit

Nf , Nc → ∞ ,

x :=

Nc

kept ﬁnite .

(1)

In all the cases we ﬁnd that there is a critical value xc > 1, below which some of the monopole
operators decouple. Once some operators decouple we can re-do the F -maximization follow-

ing the prescription of [18–20].

When we carry out the F -maximization, we run into another subtlety: the S3 partition
function does not always converge. This causes a problem, since we need S3 partition function

to determine the correct IR scaling dimension.

What saves the day is that 3d N = 2 SQCD has a non-perturbative magnetic dual, found
by Aharony [21] (see also [22–24]).2 Whenever the electric theory has a divergent partition
function, the magnetic partition function is convergent, whose S3 partition function can be

used for F -maximization.

We point out that a gauging of ﬂavor symmetries (either continuous or discrete) can

drastically modify the IR behavior of the theory. We discuss this phenomena for the following

three examples (see later sections for precise notations):

• A gauging of the U (1)B symmetry of SU(Nc) SQCD, to obtain U(Nc) SQCD. For the
U(Nc) gauge group, the critical value xc in the Veneziano limit is also the value where
we switch from the electric to magnetic descriptions (this is also the case for USp(2Nc)
and SO(Nc) gauge groups). This is in contrast with the case of SU(Nc) SQCD, where
the magnetic description turns out to be valid above xc as well as below.

• A gauging of Z2 or Z2 × Z2 discrete ﬂavor symmetries of the SO(Nc) SQCD, to obtain

2The case of USp(2) gauge group is special, since SU(2) is also USp(2), which is also the same as SO(3)

up to global Z2 quotient. This means that a single electric theory has several diﬀerent magnetic duals.

3

O(Nc)+, O(Nc)−, Spin(Nc) or Pin(Nc) SQCD. Such a gauging changes the monopole
operator with the minimal charge. We ﬁnd some examples where the monopole oper-
ator decouples for SO(Nc) and O(Nc)+ gauge groups, but not for O(Nc)−, Spin(Nc),
Pin(Nc) gauge groups.

• A gauging of SU (Nf )V ﬂavor symmetry of U(Nc) SQCD, to obtain a quiver gauge
theory with gauge group U(Nc) × SU(Nf ) (cid:39) (U(Nc) × U(Nf ))/U(1). This gauging
changes the IR scaling dimensions, and also changes the convergence bound for the S3

partition functions.

Another highlight of our paper is a formula for the scaling dimension of the quark appli-

cable to any gauge group in the large Nf limit, up to the order of 1/N 2

f (66).

The organization of the rest of this paper is given as follows.

In sections 2, 3, 4 we

discuss SU(Nc), USp(Nc) and SO(Nc) SQCD in turn. In section 5 we brieﬂy comment on
group theory aspects of the scaling dimensions. In section 6 we discuss quiver gauge theories,

and in section 7 we comments on implications of our results to the theories arising from the

compactiﬁcations of M5-branes, and in particular their 1/4-BPS co-dimension 4 defects. The

appendices contain several technicalities and review materials.

2

SU(Nc) SQCD

Let us begin with SU(Nc) SQCD with Nf ﬂavors, and its magnetic dual [22]. Note that
in three dimensions even a U(1) gauge group becomes strongly coupled in the IR, and we

indeed will ﬁnd crucial diﬀerences from the case of U(Nc) SQCD analyzed in [6].

2.1 Dual Pairs

Electric Theory The electric theory has a gauge group (3d N = 2 vector multiplet)
SU(Nc), as well as quarks Q in the fundamental representation and anti-quarks ˜Q in the
anti-fundamental representation (these ﬁelds are 3d N = 2 chiral multiplets). We do not
have a superpotential term: Welectric = 0. The theory has Nc − 1 independent monopole
operators corresponding to the Cartan of the gauge group, however most of them are lifted

by the instanton-generated superpotential, with the exception of a a single unlifted monopole
operator which is typically denoted by Y in the literature [1] (cf. Appendix A). This should

be contrasted with the case of a U(Nc) gauge group, where we have two unlifted monopole
operators V± [1, 2].

4

The theory has SU(Nf )L × SU(Nf )R × U(1)B × U(1)A × U(1)R−UV ﬂavor symmetries,

under which the ﬁelds Q, ˜Q, Y transform as follows:

2(Nf − Nc + 1)

(2)

Here the U(1)R-charge was denoted U(1)R−UV, to emphasize that it is one of the many
possible U(1) R-symmetries of the UV theory and is not the IR U(1) R-symmetry inside the
superconformal algebra. We listed the U(1)R−UV-charge of the monopole operator Y [13];
we will comment more on this later when we discuss the S3 partition function.

Note also that the theory has no topological U(1)J symmetry: the topological U(1)J
symmetry is generated by the current J = ∗TrF , however this vanishes since the gauge ﬁeld
is traceless.

Magnetic Theory Let us ﬁrst assume that Nf > Nc. The electric theory then has a
magnetic dual [22] (see also [24]).

The gauge group is SU(Nf − Nc) × U(1)diag (cid:39) U(Nf − Nc), and not SU(Nf − Nc) as one

might naively expect. For notational simplicity we deﬁne ˜Nc by

˜Nc := Nf − Nc .

(3)

The theory has dual quark q and anti-quark ˜q, and also b and ˜b. The meson M = Q ˜Q, as
well as the monopole operator Y of the electric theory, are now fundamental ﬁelds in the
magnetic theory. The magnetic theory also has two unlifted monopole operators ˜X±.

The theory also has a superpotential

Wmagnetic = M q ˜q + Y b˜b + ˜X− + ˜X+ .

(4)

Note that this superpotential breaks the topological U(1)J symmetry, which rotates the ﬁelds
˜X±.

The magnetic theory has the same ﬂavor symmetry as the electric theory, under which

5

the ﬁelds transform as follows:

Since U(1)diag is an Abelian symmetry, there is no canonical normalization of its charges;
the charges above, which diﬀer from those in [22] by a factor of ˜Nc, are chosen in such a
way that it matches with the standard normalization when embedded into the U( ˜Nc) gauge
group.

The case of Nf = Nc requires a separate analysis.

In this case the magnetic theory
does not have any gauge ﬁelds, and is described by chiral multiplets Y, M, B, ˜B with the
superpotential

W = Y (B ˜B − det(M )) .

(6)

The ﬁelds Y and M are the monopole operator and the meson of the electric theory, as
before. The ﬁelds B and ˜B are the baryons, which when Nf > Nc are gauge-invariant and
related to the b, ˜b of the above-mentioned magnetic theory by the relation

B = q ˜Ncb ,

˜B = ˜q ˜Nc˜b .

The charge assignment of the ﬁelds M, Y, B, ˜B is

The case of Nf < Nc can be derived from the Nf = Nc theory by mass deformation.

6

For Nf = Nc − 1 the Coulomb branch smoothly connects with the Higgs branch, giving
rise the to constraint Y det(M ) = 1 [1]. When we have Nf < Nc − 1, the instanton-
generated superpotential completely lifts the vacuum moduli space [3]. For this reason we
will concentrate on the case Nf ≥ Nc in the rest of this section.

2.2 IR Analysis

As already mentioned in Introduction, the R-symmetry mentioned above is only one of

the many possible R-symmetries in the UV, and the correct IR R-symmetry inside the

superconformal algebra is a mixture of the UV R-symmetry with global symmetries. The

correct combination is determined by the procedure of F -maximization [15].

Since non-Abelian ﬂavor symmetries do not mix with the U(1) R-symmetry, we can

parametrize the R-symmetry as

RIR = RUV + aJA + bJB ,

(9)

where RUV, RIR, JA, JB are generators of U(1)R−UV, U(1)R−IR, U(1)A, U(1)B, respectively.

As we will see momentarily F -maximization gives b = 0, and b does not play crucial roles

below.

Unitarity Bound The dimensions of the operators Y, M are given by

Y : ∆Y = 2(Nf − Nc + 1) − 2Nf a ,
M : ∆M = 2a .

The unitary bound ∆Y,M ≥ 1

M : a ≥

(10)

(11)

where here and in the following the symbol ≈ will denote the Veneziano limit (1).

Note that there are other gauge singlet operators, such as ˜qq and ˜bb in the magnetic
theory, whose dimension could become smaller than the threshold value 1
2. However these
are not chiral primary operators, and hence the constraints from the unitarity bound does

not necessarily apply. For example, the operator ˜qq is trivial in the chiral ring thanks to the

7

F-term relation for the ﬁeld M , and hence is not a chiral primary. The same applies to the
operator ˜bb.

F -maximization The S3 partition function [15–17] of the electric/magnetic theories can

be written down straightforwardly following the matter content given above (see Appendix

B). For the electric theory we have

The integral is over the Cartan of the SU(Nc) gauge group, and the integrand represents the

the shorthanded notation that ± inside the expression means the sum of the corresponding
two expressions. For example,

l(1 − a ± b ± iσi) := l(1 − a + b + iσi) + l(1 − a − b − iσi) .

Note that this expression can also be obtained by formally setting Nf = Nc in (15).

Nf ﬂavors with Nf > Nc, plotted in terms of the mixing parameter a (see (9), with b = 0).
The correct IR value of a should be determined from F -maximization.

Convergence We have written down the expressions for the S3 partition function, however

they are in general only formal integral expressions and are actually not convergent.

We can analyze the convergence condition of the partition function by sending one of

the σi’s to inﬁnity (for the electric theory, we need to send one to inﬁnity and another to

i σi = 0), while keeping
other σi’s ﬁnite. We can evaluate the leading behavior of the integrand from the asymptotic
expansions (see (85) in Appendix B), and we see that the convergence bound of the partition

function is

electric:

a <

Nf − Nc + 1

Nf

≈ 1 −

1
x

,

magnetic: converges for any values of a .

(17)

Note that for numerical computations the practical convergence bound is slightly stronger

than this, since as we approach the convergence bound the computational time becomes

increasingly large.

It turns out that these conditions are the same as the condition that the dimensions of the
monopole operators (Y for the electric theory, ˜X± for the magnetic theory) are non-negative:

Y : ∆Y = 2(Nf − Nc + 1) − 2Nf a ≥ 0 ,
˜X± : ∆ ˜X±

= 2 ≥ 0 .

(18)

That we obtain the same conditions from two diﬀerent considerations is not a coincidence,

and we will encounter the same phenomena in later sections. In fact, we can think of this as

a convenient way to obtain the R-charge/conformal dimension of monopole operators.

When we analyze the convergence of the partition function, we go to inﬁnity in the

Coulomb branch in the direction of the Cartan corresponding to a monopole operator V ,
for example σ1 = −σN → ∞, σj(cid:54)=1,N = 0 in the magnetic theory (cf. Appendix A). Since
Coulomb branch parameter is a dynamical version of the real mass parameter, this has the

eﬀect of making the ﬁelds massive. We can integrate out the these massive modes, except

that we then could have induced Chern-Simons term with level keﬀ and induced FI parameter
ζeﬀ. In the theories discussed in this paper, we have keft = 0 however ζeﬀ (cid:54)= 0, leaving to the
expression

(cid:90)

Z ∼

(19)

and the dimension (or equivalently the U(1)R-charge) of the monopole operator V , whose
real part is e−2πσ1, can be identiﬁed with ζeﬀ:

ζeﬀ = ∆V .

As a side remark, this also explains clearly that the convergence condition is weaker than
the unitarity constraint: for a monopole operator V the former requires ∆V ≥ 0, while the
latter requires ∆V ≥ 1

Duality as Equality In the literature, the duality between two 3d N = 2 theories is often
translated to an equivalence of the S3 partition functions:

Zelectric = Zmagnetic .

(23)

Such equivalences have been veriﬁed in [22, 25–28].3

There are subtleties to the identity (23), however. In fact, as we have already seen in

(17), we ﬁnd that as a function of the parameter a the right hand side always converges,

whereas the left hand side converges only when a is small enough, invalidating (23).

We can see this problem more sharply for the Nf = Nc theory. The magnetic partition

function has poles at 2Nca = Z\{1}, as follows from the deﬁnition of the function l(z) (see

Appendix B). The electric partition function, however, does not show any singular behavior

at these points.

This is not in contradiction with the existing results in the literature. In the analysis

above we assumed that a is a real parameter, however in the literature a takes values in

the complex plane, where the imaginary part of a plays the role of the real mass parameter
for the U(1)A ﬂavor symmetry. The S3 partition function is known to be a holomorphic
function of this complexiﬁed parameter [15, 29], and we can then regard the both sides of

(23) as complex functions of a, establish the identities in the regions where the real part

of a is small, and then analytically continue into the whole complex plane. This is what is

usually meant by the identity (23).

However, we do not wish to turn on imaginary parts of a for the purpose of this paper.

3In Appendix D we derive such an identity fro the SU(Nc) theory from the corresponding identity for the

U(Nc) theory.

11

When we turn on the real mass parameter for the U(1)A symmetry, the quarks Q, ˜Q gets
a mass and hence can be integrated out in the deep IR, thereby dramatically changing

the IR behavior of the theory. We need to keep a real, for the numerical analysis of the

F -maximization below.

This means that we need be careful in interpreting the equality (23), at least for the

purpose of F -maximization—When only one of the two sides converge, we should use that

convergent partition function to determine the IR conformal dimensions, whereas if the

both sides converge they should give the same value of the F -function (possibly up to an

overall constant independent of the parameter a) and they both give the same IR conformal
dimensions.4

In the case of the SU(Nc) SQCD discussed here, the result (17) shows that magnetic
partition function is convergent for all the values of the parameter a. This is in sharp

contrast with the case of the U(Nc) SQCD discussed in [6], where region for the convergent
magnetic partition function was complementary to that of the electric partition function;

the overlapping region exists only for ﬁne-tuned values of Nc and Nf , and vanishes in the
Veneziano limit.

F -maximization We can determine the values of a and b by maximization of the free
energy F , related to the S3 the partition function (12) and (15) (which are identical thanks

to the duality, modulo the issues just mentioned) by the relation

F := − log |ZS3| .

(24)

Maximization with respect to b straightforwardly gives b = 0. We can then numerically

search for the maximal value of F with respect to a. Note that it is crucial for our numerical

analysis that F takes a maximal value, not just an extremal value. In fact, in many of our

examples the function F has more than one local maximums.

We have carried out explicit numerical integration of the matrix integral, and obtained
the critical value of a after F -maximization, for some sample values of small Nc and Nf ≥ Nc,
as shown in Table 1.

For the values Nf = Nc = 3, 4, 5, 6 (in entries in red boxes in Table 1) we ﬁnd that
after performing the ﬁrst F -maximization that the unitarity bound (11) is violated for some

operators. We interpret this to mean that we need to decouple corresponding operators. The

4It is possible to render the expression convergent by deforming the integration contour at inﬁnity. How-

ever, the meaning of such a deformation, and the connection with the F -theorem, is not clear.

Table 1: The scaling dimension ∆Q of the ﬂavor multiplets (above) and the maximal value
of F -function (below), at the conformal ﬁxed points for a few small values of Nf and Nc in
3d N = 2 SU(Nc) SQCD with Nf ﬂavors. We have computed this from the electric theory,
except for the diagonal entries and the blue-colored entries where we used a simpler magnetic
theory for more eﬃcient numerical evaluation. For Nc = Nf = 3, 4, 5, 6 either one or two
operators hit the unitarity bound, and consequently we need to decouple them and repeat
the F -maximization with the modiﬁed F -function (25), until the procedure terminates. For
Nc = Nf = 4, 5, 6 we ﬁnd a sequence of decoupling of operators, leaving to a free IR theory
eventually—for example, for Nc = Nf = 4 operators M and Y decouple ﬁrst, and the baryon
B becomes free after the second F -maximization, Similarly, for Nc = Nf = 6 we ﬁnd that
ﬁrst Y decouples, then M , and ﬁnally B becomes free. Such a decoupling pattern is shown
inside the bracket in the red box. Note that the value of the scaling dimension ∆Q shown
here is the value after all the possible decoupling eﬀects are taken into account, and not the
value after the ﬁrst F -maximization.

13

details of the decoupling varies for diﬀerent values of Nf and Nc, as shown in the diagonal
entries of Table 1.

After decoupling an operator, we need to again do F -maximization with the modiﬁed

F -function, which are for example given by

depending on whether only M , only Y or both M and Y decoupling. For the choice of

Nf = Nc = 4, 5, 6 we ﬁnd after the second (and third for Nf = Nc = 6) F -maximization that
we need to decouple further operators, and consequently ﬁnd that all the operators M, Y, B

become free, leaving to a free IR theory.

Something interesting happens for Nf = Nc ≥ 6. After the ﬁrst F -maximization, we ﬁnd
that the monopole operator Y decouples. After decoupling Y , we ﬁnd that the modiﬁed

F -function apparently has no maximum. We propose to interpret this as a signal for the

decoupling of the baryon B. After yet another F -maximization we ﬁnd that the meson M

also becomes free, leading to the critical value a = 1/4 and the trivial IR ﬁxed point. One

consistency check of this proposal is that the critical value a = 1/4 is consistent with the

analysis of the Veneziano limit shown below in Figure 2.

Note also that the value of the F at the critical value decreases as we decrease the value

of Nf . This is consistent with the F -theorem [30–33], since we can give a mass to one of
the ﬂavors, thereby reducing the number of ﬂavors by one. It is probably worth pointing

out that for a ﬁxed ﬂavor number Nf the value of the free energy F could decrease as we
increase Nc.

In Table 1 the monopole operator decoupling happens only in the diagonal Nf = Nc.
However this is an artifact of the choice of small Nc, Nf values. The constraint from the
unitarity bound (10) becomes stronger as we increase the value of Nc, Nf , and therefore we
expect to ﬁnd more and more examples of (Nc, Nf ) with monopole decoupling.

To analyze monopole decoupling in the Veneziano limit, we adopt techniques of [6, Ap-

pendix A.3] (see also [34]), which gives the scaling dimension ∆Q of the quarks/anti-quarks

The combined plot of the numerical data points as well as the large x expansion of (27)

xc ≈ 1.46.

Figure 2: ∆Q as a function of x = Nf /Nc in the Veneziano limit. Points were computed by
extrapolating small Nc numerical results. Dotted line is the unitarity bound (11). We ﬁnd
that ∆Q(x) hits the unitarity bound at the critical value xc ≈ 1.46. The black curve at large
values of x is the analytical approximation (27). In the region right to the red curve, we use
electric theory, while in the left region we use magnetic theory with monopole Y decoupled
when needed. The right plot is a zoomed-in version of the left one around the critical value
xc.

The analysis in this subsection is partly case-by-case, and it would be interesting to ﬁnd

more uniform patterns in their IR behaviors. A related question is to ﬁnd a concrete UV

Lagrangian description of the theory after decoupling of monopole operators, perhaps along

the lines of [35].

Let us next consider the USp(2Nc) theory.5 We ﬁnd that the structure here is similar to
the case of the U(Nc) theory. In particular, we ﬁnd a small window where the electric and
magnetic descriptions hold simultaneously, which window shrinks in the Veneziano limit.

3.1 Dual Pairs

Electric Theory The electric theory is given by quarks Q, and comes with a monopole
operator Y . We do not have a superpotential term: Welectric = 0. The theory has SU(2Nf )×
U(1)A × U(1)R−UV ﬂavor symmetry, under which the quark Q and the monopole operator Y
transform as follows:

USp(2Nc) SU(2Nf ) U(1)A U(1)R−U V

Q

(28)

Magnetic Theory For Nf > Nc + 1, the dual magnetic theory has USp(2Nf − 2Nc −
2) gauge symmetry with 2Nf chiral multiplets, dual quark qi, and additional single chiral
multiplets M and Y [21]. Coulomb branch of this magnetic theory is parametrized by the
monopole operator ˜Y .

The theory also has a superpotential

Wmagnetic = M qq + Y ˜Y .

(29)

(30)

For Nf = Nc + 1, we expect that the magnetic theory is trivial. We propose that the

5Readers not interested in USp or SO gauge groups can proceed directly to the discussion of quiver gauge

theories in section 6.

16

magnetic theory in this case is described by Y and M , with the superpotential

W = Y Pf (M ) .

(31)

We can verify that this theory is consistent with the charge assignment, which is given as

SU(2Nf )

(32)

We have a deformed moduli space Y Pf (M ) = 1 for Nf = Nc [36], and the supersymmetry

is broken for Nf < Nc. We therefore concentrate on the case Nf > Nc below.

3.2 IR Analysis

Let us parametrize the IR R-symmetry by

RIR = RUV + aJA ,

where the notation is the same as in the previous section.

Unitarity Bound The dimensions of the operators Y and M are

∆Y = 2(Nf − Nc) − 2Nf a ,

∆M = 2a .

The width of intersection of these two regions shrinks to zero in the Veneziano limit.

F -maximization We can again numerically maximize the F -function for small values of

Nc and Nf . For this purpose it is sometimes useful to use the trick explained in Appendix

18

Figure 3: The unitarity bound and the convergence bound for 3d N = 2 USp(2Nc) SQCD
with Nf ﬂavors with Nf > Nc + 1, plotted in terms of the mixing parameter a (see (33)).
The correct IR value of a should be determined from F -maximization. The structure here
is very similar to the U(Nc) SQCD case discussed in Appendix C (Figure 10).

E (the same trick could be applied to the SO(Nc) theory discussed in the next section). The
results of the numerical computation is summarized in Table 2.

For Nf = Nc > 2, we always see that the monopole Y always saturates the unitarity
bound, thus we set its scaling dimension at 1
2. This modiﬁed magnetic theory forces a = 1
4.
Inside the table Y is the only operator which decouples in the IR, and in this sense the

structure here is much simpler than that of the SU(Nc) SQCD discussed in previous section.
We can again check the consistency with the F -theorem by decreasing the values of Nf

for a ﬁxed Nc.

We can also obtain analytic expressions of the scaling dimensions in the large Nf limit, by
the techniques of [6, Appendix A.3]. This gives the scaling dimension of the electric quarks

of F -function (below), at the conformal ﬁxed points for a few small values of Nf and Nc
in 3d N = 2 USp(2Nc) SQCD with Nf ﬂavors. For the red boxes in the diagonal (i.e.
2Nf = 2(Nc + 1)) entries we ﬁnd after the ﬁrst F -maximization that we need to decouple
the monopole operator Y . In most of the entries we used the electric partition functions,
except in the red-colored (along the diagonal) and blue-colored (at 2Nc = 8, 2Nf = 12)
entries we used magnetic partition functions, since the magnetic description is more suitable
for numerical computations.

coming from the several explicit integrations for small values of Nc and Nf . We ﬁnd good
agreement between numerical and analytical results, and the critical value for x is given by
xc ≈ 1.42.

SO(Nc) SQCD

Let us now discuss the case of the SO(Nc) gauge group. The duality for this case is worked
out in [23] (see [28, 37, 38] for a closely related discussion for O(Nc) theories).

It should be kept in mind that the details of the duality depends on the global properties

of the gauge group (e.g. SO(Nc), O(Nc), Spin(Nc) or Pin(Nc)), as well as the set of local

at large and small values of x are the analytical approximation (41) and (42), respectively.
In the region right to the red curve, we use electric theory (coloured in red), while in the left
region we use magnetic theory with monopole Y decoupled (colored blue).

operators we include to the theory. For example, for the O(Nc) gauge group, we have two
choices, which are denoted by O(Nc)± [23]. In the following we ﬁrst deal with the case of
the SO(Nc) gauge group, and then come back to the cases of O(Nc)+, O(Nc)−, Spin(Nc) and
Pin(Nc) gauge groups in section 4.3.

4.1 Dual Pairs

Electric Theory The electric theory has quarks Q in the fundamental representation, and

as usual we have Welectric = 0. The theory also has the monopole operator Y , the baryon B,
as well as a composite “baryon-monopole operator” β.

Magnetic Theory Let us consider the case Nf > Nc + 1. First, the magnetic theory has
dual quarks q. The meson M as well as the monopole operator Y of the electric theory, are

now fundamental ﬁelds in the magnetic theory. The magnetic theory also has the monopole
operator ˜Y , the baryon ˜B, and the dual baryon-monopole ˜β.

Note that the baryon B and the baryon-monopole β do not appear as fundamental ﬁelds

of the magnetic theory (compare this with the case of SU(Nc) theory). Rather they are
identiﬁed with their magnetic counterparts ˜B, ˜β, by an identiﬁcation

(B, β) ←→ ( ˜β, ˜B) .

case Nf ≥ Nc − 1.

Unitarity Bound Let us consider the electric theory. The dimensions of the operators

are given by

M : ∆M = 2a ,
Y : ∆Y = (Nf − Nc + 2) − Nf a ,

β : ∆β = (Nf − Nc + 2) − a(Nf − Nc + 2) .

Notice that in the Veneziano limit, the unitarity bound for the monopole operator Y depends

on the value of x, whereas that for the baryon-monopole β is independent of x.

Partition Function Let us write down the S3 partition functions of electric and magnetic

theories. The precise expression depends on whether Nc is even or odd.

For Nc even with Nc = 2r, the electric partition function is given by (see (86) and (87))

In this case there is a small overlapping region where both electric and magnetic descriptions

are valid. However the width of the overlapping region shrinks to zero in the Veneziano

limit. It is therefore expected that we really should not expect both electric and magnetic

descriptions to be valid, except for only for limited values of Nc and Nf .

Figure 5: The unitarity bound and the convergence bound for 3d N = 2 SO(Nc) SQCD
with Nf ﬂavors with Nf > Nc − 1, plotted in terms of the mixing parameter a (see (49)).
The correct IR value of a should be determined from F -maximization. Depending on the
value of a, operators decoupling might be either none, only Y , or both Y and β. While the
baryon-monopole β could in principle decouple, this does not happen in the exampled we
studied, both numerically and analytically.

F -maximization We have done the F -maximization for several small values of Nc and
Nf .6

6Note that part of the entries have appeared in [37], which gives the critical values of a consistent with
ours, in the ﬁrst F -maximization. In several cases, however, the monopole operators decouple and we need
to do another F -maximization, to determine the correct U(1) R-symmetry.

Table 3: The scaling dimension ∆Q of the ﬂavor multiplets (above) and the maximal value
of F -function (below), at the conformal ﬁxed points for a few small values of Nf and Nc
in the 3d N = 2 SO(Nc) (or (O+(Nc)) SQCD with Nf ﬂavors. For the diagonal entries
(Nf = Nc − 1) we have used the partition function of the magnetic theory, and for entries
in red box we need to decouple the monopole operator Y . All other entries are computed in
the electric theory, except in blue boxes and in diagonal entries where we used the magnetic
theory for better numerical computations.

As commented before, one interesting feature of SO(Nc) theories is the existence of the
baryon-monopole operator β. This means that the baryon-monopole β, in addition to the

baryon B, could decouple in the IR. In the examples we studied in Table 3, however, we ﬁnd

that β never decouples (this is also the case in the Veneziano limit, to be discussed below,

see Figure 6).

We also compute ∆Q(Nc, Nf ) for both Nc odd and even, in the large Nf limit. The S3
partition functions take slightly diﬀerent forms for Nc odd and even, however it is natural
to think that the value of ∆Q(Nc, Nf ) should coincide between the two cases in this limit.
Analytic calculation by order in 1
shows that odd/even cases give the same answer, which

Figure 6: ∆Q as a function of x = Nf /Nc in the Veneziano limit. Points were computed
by extrapolating small Nc numerical results. Dotted line is the unitarity bound (51). We
ﬁnd that ∆Q(x) hits the unitarity bound at the critical value xc ≈ 1.45. The black curves
at large and small values of x are the analytical approximation (59) and (61), respectively.
In the region right to the red curve, we use electric theory, while in the left region we use
magnetic theory with monopole Y decoupled.

4.3 O(Nc)±, Spin(Nc) and Pin(Nc) Gauge Groups
Dual Pairs Let us now come to the other gauge groups, O(Nc)±, Spin(Nc) and Pin(Nc).
Note that all these gauge groups have the same Lie algebra as that of SO(Nc). These
dualities can be obtained by gauging discrete Z2 symmetries of the SO(Nc) electric and
magnetic theories.

When we gauge a single Z2 symmetry, there are three choices: ZC, ZM and Z ˜M, leading

to O(Nc)+, O(Nc)− and Spin(Nc) theories, respectively, for the electric theory.

28

1.01.21.41.61.82.02.2x0.260.280.300.320.340.360.38DQWe can apply the same gauging to the magnetic theory.

In fact, all the terms which

appear in the magnetic superpotentials (see (45) and (47)) have charge +1 under any of the
three Z2 symmetries, and hence the gauging is consistent with the superpotential. There is
one big diﬀerence from the electric case, however: the role of the ZM and Z ˜M should be
exchanged, as follows from the identiﬁcation (44).

When we gauge two Z2 symmetries, there is only one choice, since we are gauging all the

discrete symmetries, and we obtain the Pin(Nc)− theory.
These gauging patterns are summarised in Figure 7.

Figure 7: By gauging either ZC, ZM and Z ˜M symmetries of the SO(Nc) theory we obtain
O(Nc)+, O(Nc)− and Spin(Nc) gauge groups. Further gauging the remaining Z2, we obtain
the Pin(Nc) theory. This ﬁgure represents the gauging of the electric theory, and for the
magnetic theory we should exchange the role of ZM and Z ˜M. As we will explain later,
the gauge groups boxed in red and those boxed in blue have diﬀerent monopole operators,
diﬀering by a power of 2 (see (64)).

This immediately implies that the correct Aharony-like duality works as [23]

O+(Nc) ←→ O+(Nf − Nc + 2) ,
O−(Nc) ←→ Spin(Nf − Nc + 2) ,
Spin(Nc) ←→ O−(Nf − Nc + 2) ,
Pin(Nc) ←→ Pin(Nf − Nc + 2) .

This should be compared with the SO duality

SO(Nc) ←→ SO(Nf − Nc + 2) .

(62)

(63)

When we gauge discrete Z2 symmetries, we project out the ﬁelds which has charge −1.
For example, when gauging the ZC
2 symmetry (charge conjugation symmetry) we obtain

29

the dualities for O+ gauge groups. In this case, the baryon B and the baryon-monopole β
are projected out, while their combinations, such as B2 and Bβ, remain in the theory.

Similarly, when we gauge either ZM or Z ˜M symmetry, the monopole operator in itself is

projected out, and we instead have its square remaining:

YSpin = YO−

= YPin := Y 2 .

(64)

IR Analysis We now come to a natural question: does the gauging of the discrete sym-

metries discussed above have any impact on the IR behavior of the theory?

It turns out most of the preceding analysis for SO gauge groups does not require any

modiﬁcation. This is because we are primarily interested in F -maximization, which requires
only the S3 partition function with no operators inserted, and hence is insensitive to gauging

of discrete symmetries.

There is one big change, however. While we have the same set of operators, gauging

makes some of the gauge-invariant operators gauge-non-invariant. Since the unitarity bound

applies only to gauge-invariant operators, the discrete symmetry gauging will in general

change the unitarity bounds.

In the analysis for the SO gauge groups we did not ﬁnd any examples where the baryon

B, the meson M , or the baryon-monopole β decouple. We can therefore concentrate on the
monopole operator Y . As we discussed above, the change for Spin, O− and Pin gauge groups
is that the gauge-invariant monopole operator is not Y , but rather Yspin = Y 2 (64), whose
scaling dimension is twice that of Y .

This immediately means that the unitarity bound for Y in (51) is replaced by

Yspin : a ≤

Nf − Nc + 7

4

Nf

≈ 1 −

1
x

,

(65)

As expected, the diﬀerence from the discrete symmetry gauging goes away in the Veneziano

limit.

We can redo the IR decoupling analysis, to obtain the new table as in Table 4. Clearly

the only diﬀerence can happen when the monopole operator Y decouples in the SO theory.
In the table this happens when Nf = Nc− 1 = 2, 3, when the monopole operator Y no longer
decouples.

5 Digression on Group Theory

While the analysis in sections 2, 3 and 4 are treated separately, some of the structures are

can understood in a more uniﬁed manner from the representation theory of the Lie algebras,

as one might expect.

To give one example for this phenomena, let us point out that the scaling dimension of

the quarks and anti-quarks ∆Q = ∆ ˜Q, in the large Nf expansion up to the order of

with which we can verify that (66) reproduce the formulas (26), (40), (58) and (101). We

expect the formula (66) to apply to SQCD with other gauge groups, e.g. exceptional gauge

groups. That the quadratic Casimirs appear in the expansion coeﬃcients can be explained
by the fact that the coeﬃcients compute the certain Feynman diagrams (cf. [6, Appendix
B]). Note that in the leading Veneziano limit we always have CF ∼ Nc
2 , CA ∼ Nc and the
diﬀerences of the gauge groups are washed away. This is basically the reason that the plots

of ∆Q (in Figures 2, 4 and 6), as well as the critical value xc, are similar among diﬀerent
choices of gauge groups with the same ranks.

6 Gauging and Quiver Gauge Theories

The diﬀerence between U(Nc) theory and the SU(Nc) theory is an example where the gauging
of a ﬂavor symmetry dramatically modiﬁes the IR dynamics. We have also seen in section 4.3

that gauging of discrete symmetries also changes the IR decoupling. These can be thought of

as particular examples of more general phenomena where the gauging of a ﬂavor symmetry

modiﬁes the IR dynamics of the theory.

As yet another example of this type, we study gauging of the SU(Nf ) ﬂavor symmetry of
the SQCD, to obtain a quiver gauge theory with a product gauge group. We discuss the eﬀect

of the gauging to the IR R-symmetry, and to the decoupling of monopole operators. Such

quiver gauge theories naturally arise in string theory (see e.g [39,40] and references therein),

and (as we will discuss later in the next section) for example in the compactiﬁcations of

M5-branes.

6.1 Electric Gauging

Let us start with the U(Nc) SQCD with Nf ﬂavors, discussed in section C.

32

As shown in (88), this theory has SU(Nf )L × SU(Nf )R symmetry. Let us choose to
gauge the diagonal SU(Nf ) of these two SU(Nf ) symmetries, which we denote by SU(Nf )V .
The resulting theory then has U(Nc) × SU(Nf ) gauge symmetry, and SU(Nf )A × U(1)A ×
U(1)J × U(1)R−UV ﬂavor symmetry, where SU(Nf )A is the axial (anti-diagonal) combination
of SU(Nf )L × SU(Nf )R. As a result of this gauging, we obtain a quiver gauge theory, whose
quiver diagram is shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8: A Quiver diagram for the electric quiver gauge theory considered in this section.
The quiver gauge theory can be obtained by gauging the SU(M ) ﬂavor symmetry of U(N )
SQCD with M ﬂavors, or by gauging the U(N ) ﬂavor symmetry of SU(M ) SQCD with N
ﬂavors. Note that the gauge group can be thought of SU(N ) × U(M ), U(N ) × SU(M ) or
(U(N ) × U(M ))/U(1), all describing the same theory. The theory therefore has symmetry
exchanging N and M . The arrows represent bifundamental N = 2 chiral multiplets.

One remark is that the resulting theory has a symmetry exchanging Nc and Nf .

In
fact, the gauge group can equivalently be taken as (U(Nc) × U(Nf )), with matters in the
bifundamental representations Q : (Nc, Nf ) and ˜Q : (Nc, Nf ). This is a quiver gauge
theory, and since we only have bifundamental matters the overall U(1) of the (U(Nc)×U(Nf ))
gauge group trivially decouples, leading to the (U(Nc) × U(Nf ))/U (1) (cid:39) U(Nc) × SU(Nf )
gauge group as before.

In the rest of this section we use the notation N := Nc, M := Nf , to make this symmetry
more manifest. In fact, now that the symmetry is manifest we can regard the same quiver

gauge theory as obtained from the gauging SU(N )V ﬂavor symmetry of the U(M ) SQCD
with N ﬂavors, with N and M reversed from above (Figure 8).

Now, the question we ask in this subsection is whether or not this gauging of the SU(M )

symmetry has any eﬀect in the discussion of the IR scaling dimension and the decoupling of

monopole operators.

The best way to see this is to write down the S3 partition function as the parameter a

33

corresponding to the mixing of the U(1)A symmetry, as in Appendix C:

ZU(N )×SU(M )(a) =

exp [l(1 − a + iσi − iρj) + l(1 − a − iσi + iρj)] .

i=1

i=1

Note that the integral is kept invariant under the simultaneous shift of σi and ρj, and this
represents the overall decoupled U(1) commented before. The same partition function can

also be written as

In either way, it is clear that gauging dramatically change the partition function as a

function of the parameter a, and consequently the IR R-charges/conformal dimensions of

the theory. In fact, this is to be expected since we have a manifest symmetry between N

and M after gauging; by contrast Nc = N, Nf = M theory and Nc = M, Nf = N clearly
have diﬀerent IR dynamics, as we have seen in the rest of this paper.

This symmetry between N and M is actually a source for trouble, when we consider
the convergence bound for the electric S3 partition function. The convergence bound before

gauging was worked out in (17), and since now we have symmetry and N and M , we should

impose the same constraint with N and M (Nc and Nf ) exchanges. This gives

and in particular a will be negative unless N = M .

Note that convergence constraint is ameliorated by including ﬂavor matters to gauge

groups SU(N ) and SU(M ). Suppose that we include k ﬂavors (l ﬂavors) to gauge groups

SU(N ) and SU(M ). The convergence constraint then reads

(cid:18) M − N + k + 1

M

a < min

(cid:19)

,

N − M + l + 1

,

(71)

and in particular the constraint in practice goes away for suﬃciently large k and l. Such

ﬂavors are natural from string theory constructions, however we will set k = l = 0 in the

discussion below, to simplify analysis.

6.2 Magnetic Gauging

To avoid this convergence issue, one might be tempted to switch to the magnetic description.

Namely, instead of gauging the ﬂavor symmetry of the electric theory, we can choose to gauge

the ﬂavor symmetry of the magnetic theory.

For the case M > N ≥ 1, we can ﬁrst go to the magnetic theory of SU(N ) SQCD with
M ﬂavors, go to the magnetic dual, and then gauge the U(M ) (cid:39) SU(M ) × U (1)B ﬂavor
symmetry of the theory. Note that these magnetic descriptions break the symmetry between
N and M , as is clear from the fact that the magnetic descriptions requires us to take M ≥ N .

The formal equivalence of the two expressions (72) and (73) (up to a constant phase factor)

can be checked directly by using the identities (108) and (84). (In fact, this is essentially the

argument used for deriving SU dualities from U dualities, as reviewed in Appendix D).

Unfortunately, the convergence bound for (72) and (73) is satisﬁed for

(74)

where the ﬁrst (second) inequality comes from the convergence of the σ (ρ) integrals. In other

words the partition function (72) and (73) cannot be used for any practical F -maximization.

The situation is better for the case M = N . We can then gauge the SU(M = N ) ﬂavor

symmetry of the magnetic U(N ) theory, leading to the partition function

It is natural to expect that the magnetic quiver theories discussed here are dual to the

electric quiver gauge theories discussed before. There is one caveat, however. We have

implicitly assumed that the order of two operations, namely gauging of the ﬂavor symmetry

and going to the dual magnetic description, commute with each other. Since the duality

at hand is an IR duality, in general the gauging of the ﬂavor symmetry could change the

behavior under the RG ﬂow, and hence spoil the IR duality.

We however expect that this does not happen when the gauge coupling for the newly-

the magnetic partition function (75). Notice that the critical value of a is diﬀerent from that
in Table 1 before gauging the U(N ) ﬂavor symmetry. In all these cases there is no indication
that any operator decouple in the IR.

gauged ﬂavor symmetry is much smaller than other gauge couplings. If in the UV the gauge

coupling for SU(N ) is much larger than that for the SU(M ) gauge group, one imagines that

the strong coupling eﬀect of SU(N ) kicks in ﬁrst, and then the dynamics of SU(M ) does not

matter until at much lower scales. We can then discuss the dynamics of SU(N ) and SU(M )
gauge groups separately. Since the S3 partition function is independent of gauge couplings,
the equality of the S3 partition functions should hold for any value of the gauge coupling,

giving further evidence for the duality after gauging.

Numerical Results The numerical analysis of the quiver case is computationally more

challenging than the SQCD case, and as we have seen the convergence bound tends to be

severe. Therefore let us here consider the simplest case of N = M magnetic theory. We

can then do F -maximization for the partition function (75) (compare with Table 1). The

numerical results for the values N = M = 2, 3, 4, 5 are summarized in Table 5.

There are two remarks on this result. First, the value of a at the maximum is diﬀerent

from that before gauging, as expected. Another non-trivial result here is that here in none

of these cases exhibit operator decoupling. This is partly because the meson M of the

magnetic theory, after gauging, is now an adjoint ﬁeld with respect to the newly-introduced

gauge symmetry, and hence is not gauge invariant. Therefore there is no need to consider

the unitarity bound of the meson itself.

6.3 General Quivers

Having discussed quiver gauge theories with two nodes, we can discuss more general 3d
N = 2 quiver gauge theories, whose matter content is determined by a quiver diagram, i.e.
an oriented graph7. We can then gauge the appropriate ﬂavor symmetries, whose eﬀect is to

7We also need to specify the superpotentials, however this choice does not really modify the qualitative

features of the conclusions below.

38

concatenate two quiver diagrams and to generate a more complicated quiver diagram (Figure

9). For example, if we glue two quivers Q1, Q2 at a node to obtain a new quiver Q, then
partition function for the larger quiver Q can be schematically written in the form

(cid:90)

ZQ[σ1, σ3](a1, a2) =

dσ2 Zvector[σ2] ZQ1[σ1, σ2](a1) ZQ2[σ2, σ3](a2) ,

(78)

where Zvector[σ2] is the contribution from the vector multiplet which is gauged under the
gluing, and a1,2 denote the parameters repressing the ﬂavor symmetries of the theories Q1,2.

Figure 9: We can generate a larger quiver Q by gluing together two quivers Q1 and Q2. In
gauge theory language the circle (the square) represents the gauge (global) symmetry, each
of which can be for example U(Nc) or SO(Nc) with diﬀerent values of Nc for diﬀerent nodes.
Gluing in this context means to take two ﬂavor symmetries (represented by two squares in
the middle, which we assume to contain the same ﬂavor symmetry group) and gauge the
diagonal subgroup of the product. The partition function behaves nicely under this gluing,
however not the F -maximization nor the IR behavior.

As before, the extremum of ZQ[σ1, σ3](a1, a2) as a function of a1 (a2) is in general diﬀer-
ent from that of the ZQ1[σ1, σ2](a1) (ZQ2[σ2, σ3](a2)). This means that to tell whether the
monopole operator for the gauge group in the quiver Q1 decouples or not, we need to know
in advance the detailed data for the quiver Q2, however large the quiver Q2 may be.8 This is
in sharp contrast with the case of 3d N = 4 supersymmetry, where the IR decoupling of the
monopole operators can be checked locally at the quiver diagram, by verifying the inequality

8In the spirit of [41] one might be tempted to say that there is a “long-range entanglement in the
theory space”. It would be interesting to explore this point further, and connect the discussion here to the
entanglement in the dual statistical mechanical model discussed in [42, 43].

Implications for M5-brane Compactiﬁcations

The comments from the previous section has interesting implications to the M5-brane com-

pactiﬁcations, which we now turn to.

7.1 Boundary Conditions of 4d N = 4 SYM

Let us ﬁrst start with the results of [14], which classiﬁes 1/2–BPS boundary conditions of 4d
N = 4 Super Yang-Mills Theory (SYM). Some of the boundary conditions (of the Neumann
type, realized by D3-branes ending on NS5-branes in type IIB string theory) contain a
non-trivial boundary ﬁeld theory B, which is given as a 3d N = 4 linear-chain quiver
gauge theory. When B contains monopole operators decoupling in the IR, we regard the
corresponding B as containing redundant degrees of freedom, in the sense that B contains
ﬁelds which decouples completely from the bulk 4d N = 4 theory. Since we are interested
in the classiﬁcation of the minimal set of boundary conditions in the IR, this means we
can disregard such B from the classiﬁcation of boundary conditions. This, together with
the criterion Nf ≥ 2Nc mentioned above, lead to the conclusion that the choices of B are
exhausted by the so-called Tρ[SU(N )] theories, with ρ being the partition of N .9

We can now consider the 1/4–BPS boundary conditions [46, 47], whose boundary ﬁeld
theory B would then be 3d N = 2 theories. As we have seen above the criterion for
the decoupling/un-decoupling is now more complicated than the inequality Nf ≥ 2Nc. In
particular, in the Veneziano limit10 we have learned from [6] that the decoupling happens
at the critical value xc ≈ 1.45 < 2. This suggests that the minimal set of (Neumann type)
boundary conditions should no longer be labeled by partitions.11
It would be interesting

to see if/how this conclusion could ﬁt together with the analysis of the generalized Nahm
equations in [46, 47], or their 4d N = 1 counterparts [48, 49].

9 If we consider the mixture of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions we obtain a slightly more

general class of theories T σ

ρ [SU(N )], labeled by a pair of partitions ρ, σ.

10 This is natural in the context of the holographic dual.
11 In 3d N = 2 theories, for each vertex of the quiver diagram we have the choice of whether or not to
include N = 2 adjoint chiral multiplet. This means that the natural generalization of the 1/2–BPS analysis
is that the boundary conditions are labeled by a decorated partition. However, our point here is that this is
likely a redundant characterization of the IR boundary condition.

7.2 Co-dimension 2 Defects of 6d (2, 0) Theory

Since the 4d N = 4 SU(N ) SYM is an S1 compactiﬁcation of 5d N = 2 SU(N ) SYM (super-
Yang-Mills) and also a T 2 compactiﬁcation of the 6d (2, 0) theory of AN−1 type, we can try
to lift the conclusions of the previous subsection into the statements on the 5d N = 2 SYM
and the 6d (2, 0) theory.

For the 1/2-BPS case, the same consideration leads to the conclusion that (see [50, section

2.1] for review) the 1/4–BPS co-dimension 2 defects are labeled by a partition ρ of N , and the
eﬀect of the defect in the 5d language is to couple the 5d N = 2 SYM to the Tρ[SU(N )] theory
mentioned above. This fact has been utilized recently in the context of the compactiﬁcations

of the 6d theories on 2-manifolds [51–53] and 3-manifolds [50, 54].

Now we can repeat the same argument for the 1/4–BPS boundary conditions, and again
obtain 1/4–BPS boundary conditions for 5d N = 2 SYM and the 6d (2, 0) theory. Our
conclusion is then that these defects should not be labeled by partitions, since otherwise we

would be over-counting. This should have some interesting counterparts as data specifying
1/4–BPS defects in 4d N = 2 theories arising from the 2-manifold compactiﬁcations [55,56],
or 3d N = 2 theories arising from the 3-manifold compactiﬁcations [57–60].

where (σ1, . . . , σr) are the Cartan part of the scalar in the adjoint vector multiplet, and
(a1, . . . , ar) are the dual photon of the Cartan part of the gauge group. The latter is periodic

41

with period 2πg2

Only the Yα’s for positive simple roots α are independent, and hence classically we have r
independent monopole operators. This parametrizes the classical Coulomb branch. However

many of these Coulomb branches are lifted by quantum corrections (instanton-generated

superpotential).

For example, for SU(Nc), classically we have Nc − 1 monopole operators

C U(Nc) SQCD

In this Appendix we brieﬂy summarize the case of the U(Nc) gauge group [6]. It is instructive
to compare the discussion in this Appendix with that of the SU(Nc) theory in the main text.
Some of the ingredients discussed in this Appendix will be used in the discussion of quiver

gauge theories in section 6.

C.1 Dual Pairs

Electric Theory The electric theory is similar to the SU(Nc) SQCD. The major diﬀerence
is that we have two remaining monopole operators V±.

The theory has a U(Nc) gauge symmetry, as well as SU(Nf )L × SU(Nf )R × U(1)A ×
U(1)J × U(1)R−UV ﬂavor symmetries, under which the ﬁelds Q, ˜Q, Y transform as follows:

(88)

Note that compared with the SU(Nc) case we have the topological U(1)J symmetry in this
case, whereas the U(1)B symmetry, being part of the gauge symmetry, is absent.

Magnetic Theory Let us ﬁrst assume Nf > Nc. The magnetic theory has gauge group
U( ˜Nc) (remember the deﬁnition ˜Nc := Nf − Nc), and has dual quark q, anti-quarks ˜q, and
the meson M = Q ˜Q and V±. The magnetic theory also has two monopole operators ˜V± for
the dual photons of magnetic gauge groups. The superpotential is given by

Wmagnetic = ˜qM q + V+ ˜V− + V− ˜V+ .

(89)

The theory again has the same ﬂavor symmetry as the electric theory, under which the

ﬁelds transform as follows:

C.2 IR Analysis

As in other cases discussed in the main text, we need to consider the IR-mixing of the U(1)

R-symmetry with the U(1)A symmetry

RIR = RUV + aJA .

(93)

Note that we do not need to consider the mixing with the topological U(1)J symmetry, since
otherwise the parity is broken.

(94)

(96)

Unitarity Bound The dimensions of V± and M are given by

∆V±

= (Nf − Nc + 1) − Nf a ,

∆M = 2a ,

D SU(Nc) Dualities from U(Nc) Dualities

In this Appendix we derive the SU(Nc) dualities from the U(Nc) dualities. The basic ar-
gument is not really new, and basically the same as in [24], except that here we work out
the derivation at the level of the S3 partition function (as opposed to the 3d index in [24]).

Similar manipulations appear in the discussion of quiver gauge theories in section 6.

Let us begin with the partition functions of U(Nc) theories, with all the real mass/FI
parameters to our partition functions turned on in (97), (98) (this means that a is now com-

plexiﬁed). When we denote the real mass parameters for the U(1)J , SU(Nf )L and SU(Nf )R

Now to obtain the SU(Nc) duality all we need to do is apply the S-transformation (as
deﬁned in [61]) to the U(1)J global symmetry. In other words we add an oﬀ-diagonal Chern-
Simons term

L =

Anew ∧ dAU(1)J ,

(105)

and gauge the gauge ﬁeld AU(1)J for U(1)J . As we will see momentarily, the new gauge ﬁeld
Anew will be identiﬁed with that of the U(1)B symmetry of the magnetic theory: at the level
of the S3 partition function this amounts to the Fourier transform with respect to ζ.

where in the last line we shifted σi → σi + σ. We can check that this gives the charge
assignment of the electric SU(Nc) theory, and in particular that this answer gives the (12)
when we take µa = ˜µa = 0 and when we identify b = iˆb.12 Note also that in the Fourier
transform we have included a factor of Nc; this was chosen such that the parameter ˆb after
the Fourier transform can be directly identiﬁed with the real mass parameter for the U(1)B
symmetry.

We can add the same oﬀ-diagonal Chern-Simons term (105) to the magnetic theory,

However this is not yet the magnetic theory discussed in the body of the text. We further

12The factor of i here is explained from the fact that the S3 partition function depends on a complex

need to use the duality for the N = 2, U(Nc = 1), Nf = 1 theory. The magnetic theory is
given in (91), where M is now a 1 × 1 matrix (a number): W = V+V−M . At the partition
function level this gives the following equality (which holds up to an overall constant term),

which is a specialization of the pentagon identity for quantum dilogarithm:

Again, if we set µa = ˜µa = 0 this coincides with the magnetic partition function (15) we
wrote down in the main text, under the identiﬁcation b = iˆb.

We discussed above the case of Nf > Nc, however the case of Nf = Nc is similar and

simpler, so we will not repeat here.

E Numerical Tricks

The evaluation of the our S3 partition function requires a multi-dimensional integral whose

integrands oscillates relatively quickly. In some cases, we ﬁnd it numerically more advanta-

geous to convert the multi-dimensional integral into a sum of a product of one-dimensional

integrals. Let us illustrate this for the case of U(Nc) SQCD: the same strategy works in a
similar manner for USp(2Nc) and SO(Nc) SQCD.
The trick is to use the Weyl character formula
