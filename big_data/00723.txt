Abstract. During the asymptoyic giant branch (AGB) phase, diﬀerent elements are dredge-
up to the stellar surface depending on progenitor mass and metallicity. When the mass loss
increases at the end of the AGB, a circumstellar dust shell is formed, where diﬀerent (C-rich
or O-rich) molecules and solid-state compounds are formed. These are further processed in
the transition phase between AGB stars and planetary nebulae (PNe) to create more complex
organic molecules and inorganic solid-state compounds (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
fullerenes, and graphene precursors in C-rich environments and oxides and crystalline silicates
in O-rich ones). We present an observational review of the diﬀerent molecules and solid-state
materials that are formed from the AGB to the PN phases. We focus on the formation routes
of complex fullerene (and fullerene-based) molecules as well as on the level of dust processing
depending on metallicity.

1. Introduction
Low- and intermediate-mass (1 < M < 8 M⊙) stars suﬀer strong mass loss and a series of thermal
pulses at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. The interstellar medium (ISM) is
thus eﬃciently enriched with speciﬁc elements/isotopes and dust grains expelled by AGB stars.
The principal nucleosynthetic processes occur on the thermal pulsing (TP) AGB phase, while
the main molecular/dust processing takes place during the short transition phase between the
AGB phase and the planetary nebula (PN) stage. Carbon (12C) and s-process neutron-rich
elements (e.g., Rb, Zr, Sr, Nd, Ba, Tc) are synthesized and transported to the stellar surface
during the TP-AGB phase. Solar metallicity low-mass (M<1.5 M⊙) AGB stars remain O-rich
and they probably do not form an observable PN, while more massive (1.5<M<4 M⊙) AGBs are
converted to C-rich (C/O>1) stars. The most massive (M>4 M⊙) AGBs remain also as O-rich
stars because of the activation of the hot bottom burning (HBB) process. Also, the dominant
neutron source (13C vs. 22Ne) at the s-process site depends on stellar mass, which translates
into diﬀerent s-process abundances patterns (e.g., the [Rb/Zr] ratio; see e.g., [1]). This basic
AGB picture is strongly dependent on metallicity (e.g., [1,2,3] and references therein); e.g., the
minimum progenitor mass to eﬃciently activate the HBB process decreases at lower metallicities.
The higher mass AGB stars thus produce diﬀerent elements/isotopes than the lower mass AGB
ones, this being imprinted in the gas and circumstellar dust chemistry. At the end of the AGB,
the more massive C-rich and O-rich stars are also heavily obscured by their thick circumstellar

dust envelopes (CSE), experiencing a phase of total obscuration in their way to form PNe; they
are thus only accesible in the infrared (IR) and millimeter spectral ranges.

AGB and post-AGB stars are also amazing molecular factories; i.e., more than 70 molecules
have been detected in AGB CSE through their rotational transitions from the IR to millimeter
wavelengths (e.g., [4]). These are mainly gas-phase molecules: i), inorganics like SiS and AlCl;
ii) organics such as H2CO and CH3CN; iii) radicals (e.g., HCO+); iv) rings (e.g., C3H2); and v)
chains (e.g., HC9N). We note that the formation of most (although not all) of these molecules
may be explained by gas-phase reactions but solid-state chemistry has to be considered also in
the models; i.e., molecules (e.g., H2) may form on dust grains.

The CSE dust composition of sources evolving from the AGB to the PN stage depends on
the dominant star’s chemistry (i.e., the C/O ratio). The C-rich (C/O>1) AGB stars show
SiC and amorphous carbon, although other complex and disordered organic solids with mixed
aromatic/aliphatic structures like kerogen and coal may provide also the strong dust continuum
emission (e.g., [5]). The O-rich (C/O<1) AGBs, however, display amorphous silicates, weak
crystalline silicates such as piroxenes, and refractory oxides (e.g., corundum and spinel) (e.g.,
[6]). On the other hand, young and evolved O-rich PNe mainly display strong crystalline silicate
features, while the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs, generally attributed to polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons; PAHs) and unidentiﬁed IR emission features (UIRs) are observed in the C-rich
ones. Finally, double-chemistry PNe are characterized by both C-rich (e.g., PAHs) and O-rich
(e.g., crystalline silicates) dust features (e.g., [7]).

Several dust types can be diﬀerentiated depending on the solid-state features observed in the
Spitzer Space Telescope spectrocopic observations of Galactic PNe (see Figure 1, left panel),
which otherwise are generally characterized by a strong IR dust continuum emission [8,9].
Carbon chemistry (CC) and oxygen chemistry (OC) PNe display respectively C-rich and O-rich
dust features that may be aliphatic/amorphous and/or aromatic/crystalline. Double-chemistry
(DC) PNe simultaneously show C-rich (mainly aromatic) and O-rich dust features (crystalline
and/or amorphous). Finally, featureless (F) PNe show only nebular emission lines in their IR
spectra with very weak dust continuum emission.

In general, there is a process of crystallization or aromatization during the short (∼102-104
years) transition phase AGB−PN and the crystalline (O-rich) and aromatic (C-rich) structures
are created during this short stage (e.g., [10,5,11]). Stars evolving from AGB stars to PNe are
thus great laboratories for astrochemistry, providing us with strong observational constraints on
the gas-phase and solid-state chemical models. The major challenge is to unveil the formation
routes of these complex organic molecules and inorganic solid-state compounds. Here we present
an observational review of the several molecular (and solid-state) materials that are formed in
the AGB−PN phase, focussing on the formation pathways of complex fullerene (and fullerene-
based) molecules as well as on the level of dust processing depending on metallicity.

2. Dust composition versus metallicity
The diﬀerent Spitzer dust types observed in PNe are shown in Figure 1 (left panel). These
Spitzer dust types show a strong dependence on metallicity; see Table 1 in [12] where the Spitzer
dust type statistics for Galactic bulge (high metallicity) and disk (intermediate metallicity) PNe
are compared with those observed in the lower metallicitiy PNe of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs).
Dust features overimposed to the dust continuum are less frequent at the lower MC metallicities.
Crystalline silicate features (and another O-rich dust features) are quite rare in the MCs, where
carbon chemistry (CC) PNe are predominant [13].
In addition, double-chemistry (DC) PNe
dominate towards the Galactic bulge [7], while they are not observed in the low-metallcity
environments of the MCs. The mixed-chemistry (DC), C-rich (CC), and O-rich (OC) PNe are
equally distributed in the Galactic disk [8,9].

from top to bottom:

Figure 1. Left panel: Examples of the several Spitzer dust types found in compact (presumably
young) Galactic PNe;
featureless (F); carbon-chemistry aromatic or
aliphatic (CCar or CCal); oxygen-chemistry crystalline or amorphous (OCcr or OCam); and
double-chemistry (DC) (updated from [8]). Right panel: Infrared Space Observatory (ISO)
spectrum of the proto-PN IRAS 22272+5435 showing the presence of the still unidentiﬁed 21,
26, and 30 µm features (updated from [14]). The aliphatic discrete features (e.g., at 3.4 and 6.9
µm) and the 8 and 12 µm aliphatic plateaus together with AIBs (e.g., at 6.2 and 7.7 µm) are
also seen.

2.1. Oxygen-rich dust PNe
The O-rich dust PNe are less frequent at the lower MC metallicities [13] and the several Spitzer
O-dust subtypes (amorphous or crystalline) vary with metallicity (e.g., [9]). In particular, the
∼9.7 µm broad emission band due to amorphous silicates is more common in the Galactic disk
(intermediate metallicity), while the narrower crystalline silicate emission features (such as those
of olivine and pyroxene at ∼23.5, 27.5, and 33.5 µm) completely dominate in the Galactic bulge
(high metallicity), which otherwise are almost absent in the MCs. The O-rich dust features evolve
from amorphous to crystalline silicates during the AGB−PN phase [10]. Two main scenarios
may explain the silicates crystallization depending on temperature: a) at low temperature in
long-lived circumbinary disks [15]; or b) at high temperature, because of the strong mass loss,
at the tip of the AGB [6].

2.2. Carbon-rich dust PNe
A diﬀerent situation is found for the C-rich dust PNe. They are more common at the low
metallicity of the MCs than at higher metallicity (Galactic disk or bulge).
In the MCs, the
C-rich dust PNe generally display small dust grains (or less processed) [13]; the C-rich aliphatic
dust features dominate their Spitzer spectra, while the PAH-like emission bands are very rare.
In addition, the C-rich dust PNe dominate at the MC low-metallicity but they are not observed
at the very high metallicity of the Galactic bulge. In particular, broad emission dust features of

aliphatic character (e.g., at ∼9−13, 15−20, and 25−35 µm; see Section 3) are usually detected
in MC PNe, while Galactic disk C-rich dust PNe are usually compact (presumably young) PNe
of slightly subsolar metallicity [9]. In the case of nearly solar metallicities, small hydrocarbon
molecules (e.g., acetylene) are synthesized in the short transition phase AGB−PN, replacing
the broad ∼11.5µm feature due to SiC (as well as the strong dust continuum emission) seen in
the previous AGB phase. The IR features rapidly change from aliphatic to PAH-like (aromatic)
during the post-AGB phase and the nebular emission lines (sometimes the broad ∼25−35 µm
aliphatic emission feature is still detected) prevail in the PN stage [10]. The level of dust
processing seems to vary with the metallicity of the environment. For example, the transition
from aliphatic structures (the ∼9−13, 15−20, and 25−35 µm features) to aromatic ones (the
6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 µm PAH-like features) proceeds more slowly at the MCs metallicity [13].
Two models for the aromatization process from AGB stars to PNe have been proposed: a) the
PAH precursors are acetylene (C2H2) and its radical derivatives [16]; or b) the PAHs are formed
as a consequence of the photochemical processing of the dust grains, which transform aliphatics
to aromatics (e.g., [14,10]).

3. Unidentiﬁed infrared emission features at 21, 26, and 30 µm
The still unidentiﬁed set of IR emission features at ∼21, 26, and 30 µm is observed in C-rich
sources evolving from AGB stars to PNe (see Figure 1, right panel).

The carrier of the 21 µm feature, generally observed in post-AGB stars, should be a fragile
solid-state carbon compound (e.g., [17]). Several carriers such as hydrogenated fullerenes, TiC
nanoclusters, nanodiamonds, HAC, and amides have been proposed in the literature but we still
lack a ﬁrm identiﬁcation.

The 30 µm feature (sometimes with substructure at ∼26 µm), however, has been linked with
magnesium sulﬁde [18], aliphatic chains [19] or HACs [20]. The carrier should be quite abundant
in the CSE because it is detected from the AGB to the PN phases, carrying out a signiﬁcant
fraction of the total energy output. Remarkably, the HAC-like identiﬁcation, some kind of solid
with a mixed aromatic/aliphatic structure that may also explain the 21 and 26 µm features [20],
could explain the formation of complex dehydrogenated organics like C60, C70, and planar C24
(a small piece of a graphene sheet) in some C-rich PNe (see below).

4. Detection of complex dehydrogenated molecules
Kroto et al. [21] discovered the tridimensional C60 and C70 fullerene molecules at laboratory and
their high stability reinforced the hypothesis that they should be widespread in the ISM, being
important species for the interstellar/circumstellar chemistry. These complex species may give
an explanation to several phenomena in Astrophysics. For example, they may explain the diﬀuse
interstellar bands (DIBs) (22; see e.g., [23] for a review on interstellar/circumstellar DIBs) and
the UV bump (e.g., [24]). Fullerenes were indeed found on Earth and on meteorites and various
unsuccessful fullerene searches (e.g., by using the Infrared Space Observatory) were made to
ﬁnd the four mid-IR features (at ∼7.0, 8.5, 17.4, and 18.9 µm; see Figure 2, left panel) of the
C60 fullerene towards proto-PNe (e.g., [25]) and R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars (e.g., [26]).

Nowadays, C60 and C70 (ﬁrst discovered in space by [27]1) are known to be eﬃciently formed
in H-rich circumstellar envelopes only [28,29]. Fullerenes are detected in low-mass C-rich PNe
(both in the Milky Way and in the MCs) with normal H abundances [28,30] and in only those
RCB stars with some H [29]; C60 is usually seen in conjunction with PAH-like features. Indeed,

1 These authors interpreted the detection of C60 and C70 in the PN Tc 1 as due to the H-poor conditions in the
inner core. This interpretation is in agreement with some laboratory experiments that show that fullerenes are
eﬃciently produced under the absence of H. However, neither the central star, nor the inner core and the nebula
are H-poor or H-deﬁcient. Thus, current understanding of stellar astrophysics does not allow for Tc 1 being a
H-poor (late TP) PN (see e.g., [28,29]).

Figure 2. Left panel: Spitzer residual spectra of fullerene-containing PNe in the MCs. The
band positions of C60 (dashed) and planar C24 (dotted) are marked (updated from [30]). Right
panel: ISO spectrum of the PPN IRAS 01005+7910 in the 3-4 µm spectral region covering
several fullerane features. Note the peaks for the 0, 1, 2, and 3 non-H-bonded neighboring
carbon atoms that may be attributed to fulleranes (updated from [40]).

the C60 molecule has also been detected in another astronomical environments such as a PPN
[31], reﬂection nebulae [32], and young stellar objects [33] and none of them is H-deﬁcient.

Interestingly, unusual IR emission features at ∼6.6, 9.8, and 20 µm, attributed to the planar
C24 molecule (a small piece of a graphene sheet), have been also detected in MC and Galactic PNe
[30,34] and in the ISM [35]. Figure 2 (left panel) shows the planar C24 and C60 emission features
detected in some PNe. The detection of several complex dehydrogenated organic molecules like
fullerenes and possible planar C24 (in conjunction with aromatic species like PAHs) suggests
that other forms of carbon such as hydrogenated fullerenes (fulleranes like C60H36 and C60H18),
fullerene-PAHs adducts, metallofullerenes or even buckyonions and carbon nanotubes, may
be widespread in the Universe. For example:
i) the recent studies of DIBs in C60-rich PNe
[36,37] suggests the possibility that some DIB carrier molecules may represent other fullerene-
related molecules like buckyonions; ii) laboratory spectroscopy of adducts between fullerenes
and PAHs (e.g.,C60-anthracene/tetracene/pentacene) shows that such fullerene-PAHs species
display the same mid-IR features of isolated C60 molecules, being non distinguishable through
mid-IR spectroscopy only [38]; and iii) the recent non-detections of the most intense IR bands
of several fulleranes in two fullerene PNe [39] together with the (tentative) fulleranes detection
in the proto-PN IRAS 01005+7910 [40] (see also Figure 2, right panel) suggest that fulleranes
may be formed in the short transition phase between AGB stars and PNe but they are quickly
destroyed by the UV radiation ﬁeld from the central star.

iii) photochemical processing of hydrogenated amorphous carbon grains (HACs;

5. Formation routes of complex dehydrogenated organics
The formation process of fullerenic and graphenic nanostructures in space is still unclear to date.
Several fullerene formation mechanisms have been proposed, the most notable ones being: i) the
formation in H-poor environments [41]; ii) high-temperature formation in C-rich environments
[42];
[28]);
and iv) photochemical processing of large PAHs [43]. The ﬁrst two mechanisms prevent the
formation of hydrogenated species, something that seems to be diﬃcult to reconcile with the
astronomical observations. The alternative top-down approaches involve the photochemical
processing of HACs and large PAHs as ﬁrst proposed by [28] and [43], respectively. Both
formation scenarios are based on top-down chemical models towards the most stable C60 and
C70 fullerenes. These top-down fullerene formation scenarios (enumerated below) seem to be
quite diﬀerent to the fullerene production methods usually employed on Earth. The terrestrial
vaporization or combustion synthesis routes to form fullerene-like species cannot work in space
due to the low gas densities in the astrophysical environments; e.g., at laboratory, the main
formation channel for C60 is the build-up from atomic C, C2, small C clusters, and rings [44].

5.1. Photochemical processing of HAC-like materials
Remarkably, fullerene PNe display broad HAC-like dust features at ∼9−13 and 25−35 µm,
suggesting that the most likely explanation for the simultaneous presence of fullerenes, (possibly)
planar C24, and PAH-like emission in the H-rich circumstellar envelopes of PNe is that these
molecular species may be formed from the destruction (e.g., as a consequence of the UV radiation
from the central star) of a carbonaceous compound with a mixture of aromatic and aliphatic
structures - e.g., HACs - , which should a major constituent in their circumstellar envelopes
[28,30,34]. It is to be noted here that there are other carbonaceous materials with a mixture of
aromatic and aliphatic structures similar to HACs. For example, the mixed aromatic/aliphatic
organic nanoparticles (MAONs) ﬁrst introduced by Prof. Sun Kwok (e.g., [45,46]). The closest
natural analogue of such structure is probably kerogen, which are random arrays of aromatic
rings and aliphatic chains with functional groups made up of H, N, O, and S attached and
that may contribute to the solid-state mid-IR features detected in proto-PNe (e.g., [47]). The
coexistence of a large variety of molecular species such as HACs, PAH clusters, fullerenes,
and small dehydrogenated carbon clusters (possibly planar C24 or graphene precursors) in PNe
with fullerenes strongly supports the few laboratory experiments carried out by Scott and
colleagues in the nineties, which showed that the decomposition of HACs is sequential with
small dehydrogenated PAH molecules being released ﬁrst, followed by fullerenes and large PAH
clusters [48]. This fullerene formation scenario is also suggested by the strong - and unique -
spectral variations (in a timescale of just a few years) seen in the IR spectrum of the fullerene-
containing RCB star V854 Cen, which indicate that a signiﬁcant fraction of the dust grains
in the envelope have evolved from HACs to complex species such as PAHs and fullerene-like
molecules [29]. The recent works by [49,50] also suggest that fullerene formation in PNe likely
starts from HAC processing. Perhaps the most novel idea is introduced by [50] who propose
that UV-photolysis produces structural changes in the HAC grains, forming 3D hollow structures
or arophatic clusters (aromatic clusters linked by aliphatic bridging groups). These arophatic
clusters end up with a cage-like, cup-like or tube-like aspect, being curled-up or folded-over
graphene sheets. Further UV-induced dehydrogenation of these arophatic clusters may introduce
pentagonal rings, permitting the curvature of the structure into large fullerenic cages that can
shrink down to the most stable C60 and C70 fullerene conﬁgurations.

5.2. Photochemical processing of large PAHs
This fullerene formation route has been proposed to explain the formation of fullerenes in the
ISM [43]. These authors propose an alternative top-down model where large PAHs (with ∼70

C atoms) are converted into graphene, and subsequently fullerenes, under the action of UV
photons from massive stars. A schematic view of this alternative top-down fullerene formation
model is shown in Figure 3 of [43]. Upon UV irradiation, graphene formation takes place
through PAH photolysis. The expected dehydrogenation, fragmentation, and isomerization can
give rise to a rich organic chemistry, forming fullerenes, small cages, rings, and chains. Carbon
loss followed by pentagonal defects formation that induces curvature of the graphene sheet may
form fullerenes by migration of the pentagons. Remarkably, planar molecules such as C20 - C30
are expected to be formed by further graphene fragmentation. In the reﬂection nebula NGC
7023, emission at 6.6 µm (attributed to possible planar C24 molecules) is seen near the ionizing
star [35], suggesting that the carrier is a photo-product of PAHs. In this context, the possible
detection of the very stable planar C24 molecule in the ISM is also consistent with the idea of
fullerene production from the photochemical processing of PAHs via graphene formation.

6. Complex dehydrogenated organics versus metallicity
Interestingly, the detection rate of complex dehydrogenated fullerene molecules in C-rich PNe
decreases with increasing metallicity.
In our own Galaxy, only ∼5% of the PNe display the
fullerene features, which otherwise are clearly detected in ∼20% and ∼44% of the PNe observed
in the LMC and SMC, respectively [34]. This interesting ﬁnding suggests a higher presence
of small dust grains (or a more limited dust processing) at the lower MCs metallicity. More
recently, [51] demonstrate that all Galactic fullerene-containing PNe are low-mass objects of
sub-solar metallicity, showing that low metallicity environments are more favourable to fullerene
production and detection.

On the other hand, the still unidentiﬁed 21 µm feature is less frequent in the Galaxy than
in the MCs [52] and the 21 µm carrier could be related with the formation of fullerenes. In
particular, an anti-correlation between the 30 µm and other UIR features is seen among the
21 µm sources in the MCs [52] and such anti-correlation could result from the photochemical
processing of HAC-like dust grains into fullerenes and PAHs. Under the HACs hypothesis for
fullerene formation, the 21 µm feature should be related with the formation of fullerenes with
the carrier being a fragile intermediate product from the decomposition of HAC or a similar
material with mixed aromatic/aliphatic structures. However, [53], although based on a smaller
sample of Galactic post-AGB stars, reported that the 30 µm feature and the other UIRs are
not anti-correlated in Galactic 21 µm objects. Interestingly, the Galactic 21 µm emitters are
spectroscopically diﬀerent to the MC ones; i.e., the 21 µm proto-PNe in the MCs show more
(typical) PAH-like aromatic features.

7. Concluding remarks
The IR dust characteristics (and evolution) observed from the AGB to the PN phases in diﬀerent
metallicity environments (Galactic disk, bulge, and MCs) agree well with the predictions of
the AGB nucleosynthesis models (i.e., the expected eﬀects of the third dredge-up and HBB
processes). The coexistence of aromatic PAH-like species and complex dehydrogenated organic
molecules such as fullerenes and planar C24 (a small piece of a graphene sheet) suggests a top-
down model for the formation of fullerenes in space. Low metallicity environments like those of
the MCs favour fullerene formation and detection as well as a more limited dust processing (or
the general presence of small dust grains). Although more observational and laboratory eﬀorts
are needed, it seems clear that a diverse family of fullerene-related molecules (e.g., fulleranes,
metallofullerenes, fullerene-PAH adducts, buckyonions, etc.) is very likely to be present in space.
