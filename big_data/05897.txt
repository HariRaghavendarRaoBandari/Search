Typical brain networks consist of many peripheral regions and a few highly central ones, i.e.
hubs, playing key functional roles in cerebral inter-regional interactions. Studies have shown that
networks, obtained from the analysis of speciﬁc frequency components of brain activity, present pe-
culiar architectures with unique proﬁles of region centrality. However, the identiﬁcation of hubs in
networks built from diﬀerent frequency bands simultaneously is still a challenging problem, remain-
ing largely unexplored. Here we identify each frequency component with one layer of a multiplex
network and face this challenge by exploiting the recent advances in the analysis of multiplex topolo-
gies. First, we show that each frequency band carries unique topological information, fundamental
to accurately model brain functional networks. We then demonstrate that hubs in the multiplex
network, in general diﬀerent from those ones obtained after discarding or aggregating the measured
signals as usual, provide a more accurate map of brain’s most important functional regions, allow-
ing to distinguish between healthy and schizophrenic populations better than conventional network
approaches.

The brain functional network is generally built by in-
terconnecting brain regions according to some measure
of functional connectivity [1–3]. Studies using functional
magnetic resonance imaging [4, 5] (fMRI) provided con-
vincing evidences supporting the existence of special re-
gions, i.e. hubs, that play a fundamental role in brain
functional connectivity [6, 7] by mediating interactions
among other regions and favoring the brain’s integrated
operation. Generally, the strength of this connectivity is
empirically estimated by inter-regional correlations cal-
culated after post-processing and ﬁltering fMRI signals
with a conventional pass band, keeping components be-
tween 0.01 and 0.1 Hz [8–10]. The importance of each
region with respect to the overall connectivity, i.e. nodal
centrality in the functional network, is of particular in-
terest in many applications [2, 11–15]. However, it has
been shown that networks with unique hub regions can be
built from diﬀerent frequency ranges [16] and that region
centrality might largely ﬂuctuate depending on frequency
cuts [17], with components above 0.1 Hz also contributing
to functional connectivity with unique topological infor-
mation [18–23]. Such evidences impel the development
of a novel framework to account for full information from
all frequency bands separately and simultaneously, with-
out discarding any particular component or aggregating
some of them to build single networks.

In this study, we tackle this challenging issue by
employing the theoretical and computational tools re-
cently developed for analyzing and modeling multiplex
networks [24–27]. Multiplex architectures are special
networks consisting of diﬀerent layers, each encoding
a diﬀerent type of relationship or interaction between
nodes [28, 29]. In this context, we identify each frequency
component with a distinct layer of a multiplex network
whose nodes represent the brain’s regions of interest and
edges represent their functional connectivity in a speciﬁc
frequency range.

This novel approach arises two fundamental questions,
requiring to i) verify if and how brain regions playing

the role of hubs in the new multiplex functional net-
work diﬀer from the ones obtained using standard net-
work approaches; and ii) if and how we can exploit such
diﬀerences to improve our understanding of brain disor-
ders. In the following, we will provide extensive evidences
demonstrating that hub regions in multiplex functional
networks are diﬀerent from hub regions in standard func-
tional networks and that such diﬀerences in the nodal
centrality proﬁle allow us to identify patients aﬀected
by schizophrenia more accurately than conventional ap-
proaches based on discarding or aggregating information
about brain functional activity.

RESULTS

Building aggregated and multiplex functional
connectivity networks. We use a publicly available
COBRE data set of resting state fMRI, consisting of 71
patients aﬀected by Schizophrenia and 74 healthy con-
trols (age: 18–65). The set of 264 regions of interest
(ROIs) introduced by Power et al. [30] is used to ex-
tract the mean signal within each ROI, for each individ-
ual separately. After estimating coherence between all
pairs of ROIs, the frequency-speciﬁc connectivity matri-
ces are obtained by averaging coherence within 12 fre-
quency bands, deﬁned by decomposing the frequency
range from 0.01 to 0.25 Hz into intervals with equal
widths of 0.02 Hz. The upper bound of this frequency
range corresponds to the Nyquist frequency of fMRI sig-
nals, while the lower bound is obtained by following con-
ventional way to eliminate long term drift [9].

Weighted adjacency matrices, deﬁning the functional
network for each frequency component separately, are
yielded by discarding from frequency-speciﬁc connec-
tivity matrices those connections with non-signiﬁcant
amount of correlation (see Methods). The resulting
multiplex network is obtained, for each individual sep-
arately in control and patient groups, by interconnect-

the reduction process and its global maxima identify op-
timal structural reduction strategies.

We perform structural reducibility for each individual
separately and calculate the corresponding quality func-
tions, for control and patients groups (Fig. 2B). In both
cases, we found that the maximum value of the qual-
ity function is attained when no reduction is performed
at all, providing evidence that the topological informa-
tion carried by each functional network, corresponding
to a diﬀerent frequency component, should not be disre-
garded from structural analyses. It is worth noting that
the behavior of the quality function alone does not allow
to distinguish between the two groups of individuals.

To gain insights about (dis)similarities between diﬀer-
ent layers of the multiplex functional network in the two
groups, we use the quantum Jensen-Shannon distance
(see Methods) calculated during the structural reducibil-
ity analysis. The distance matrix, whose entries provide
the Jensen-Shannon distance between any pairs of layers,
is ﬁrst built for each individual separately, and group av-
erage µ and standard deviation σ are calculated. The
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) deﬁned by their ratio is suc-
cessively calculated for each pair of layers and for each
group, separately (Fig. 2C), as well as the relative dif-
ference between the two group-averaged values. We ob-
served diﬀerences of up to 30% in absolute value between
the two groups, for speciﬁc pairs of layers. Dissimilari-
ties between layers within the typical-band were higher
in healthy individuals than in schizophrenic patients. On
one hand, functional connectivity in healthy subjects is
rather volatile and, in general, exhibits topological dif-
ferences across individuals [16] that we did not observe
in patients, suggesting the possibility that schizophrenia
might alter brain’s integrated operation to reduce such
a functional diversity. On the other hand, an abnor-
mal amount of dissimilarity between functional networks
corresponding to other frequency bands (such as those
within relatively higher ranges, e.g. 0.09-0.19 Hz) was ob-
served in patients but not in healthy individuals. These
results suggest that the dependence on frequency of pa-
tients’ functional connectivity is diﬀerent from that of
healthy individuals and we might use such dissimilarity
patterns as a ﬁngerprint of brain’s functional organiza-
tion for each group.
Identifying schizophrenic patients by the central-
ity proﬁle of their brain functional connectivity.
The importance of a region with respect to the overall
brain functional connectivity can be quantiﬁed by cen-
trality descriptors [6, 7, 11–13, 17, 31, 32]. Here, we
propose to use PageRank [33, 34] centrality as a mea-
sure of centrality, which is based on the rationale that
nodes linked by inﬂuential nodes are more central than
those linked by un-inﬂuential nodes. It has been used in
several applications, from ranking relevant Web pages in
the World Wide Web [33] to identifying important nodes
in the human functional connectome [15] and, more re-
cently, in a variety of multiplex networks [27]. Once cen-
trality scores are calculated for each node, the set of all

brain activity with a set of 264 ROIs (here, we only draw
ﬁve ROIs, for simplicity), and estimate the coherence spec-
trum of signals between any pair of ROIs. (B) Averaged co-
herence values are calculated in 12 frequency bands (here we
only show four bands, for simplicity), to quantify the strength
of frequency-speciﬁc functional connectivity. The statistical
signiﬁcance of each connection is calculated (see Methods)
and connections with Z-score smaller than 3 are discarded.

matrices, weighted by Z-scores, that constitute the layers of

ing the layers encoding functional connectivity in each
frequency band (Fig. 1A–C). We also deﬁne two single-
layer networks, obtained by averaging coherence signals
within 0.01-0.25 Hz and 0.01-0.1 Hz frequency ranges
(Fig. 1D). We refer to such conventional networks as
full-band and typical-band single-layer networks, respec-
tively, both representing averaged and ﬁltered versions of
the full multiplex functional networks.
Structural reducibility of the multiplex functional
connectivity network. First, we verify if the multiplex
network is a valid and suitable model of the underly-
ing brain connectivity. For this purpose, we analyze the
structural reducibility of a multiplex network [26], al-
lowing to identify layers carrying redundant topological
information. The method incorporates redundant layers
into other ones to reduce the overall structure, while still
maximizing the distinguishability between the multiplex
network model and the corresponding fully aggregated
graph, obtained by summing up the connectivity of all
layers (Fig. 2A). The diﬀerence between connectivity in
diﬀerent layers is quantiﬁed by Jensen-Shannon diver-
gence (see Methods), a powerful information-theoretical
measure of (dis)similarity. A quality function controls

and 50 the number of top features used to discriminate
between healthy and schizophrenic individuals. The com-
parison between the results obtained from diﬀerent cen-
trality proﬁles are shown in Fig. 4A (see Supplementary
Figs. 1–3 for further details). Remarkably, multiplex
centrality proﬁles allow a more accurate discrimination
of the two populations, conﬁrming the hypothesis that
multiplex functional networks provide a more suitable
model of brain functional connectivity. This result is ro-
bust against the selection of the number of features used
to discriminate, with the multiplex approach signiﬁcantly
outperforming the other ones.

tional network. (A) Schematic illustration of how the anal-
ysis structural reducibility of the network works:

to identify frequency bands providing redundant topological
information and to verify the validity of the multiplex model

ductions.

their values constitutes the centrality proﬁle of the under-
lying functional network. The Spearman’s correlation co-
eﬃcient between the centrality proﬁles corresponding to
the multiplex, full-band and typical-band functional net-
works is calculated (Fig. 3A and 3B). While very strong
correlations are observed for centrality proﬁles calculated
from single-layer networks, no signiﬁcant correlation with
multiplex centrality proﬁles were found.

These results suggest the appealing possibility to use
the multiplex centrality proﬁles to gain new insights
about brain functional connectivity. To this aim, we
interpret the centrality proﬁles as characteristic fea-
tures of each individual (control or patient) and we use
the well-known and robust random forest method [35]
to train a classiﬁer distinguishing between healthy and
schizophrenic individuals (see Methods for further de-
tails). At the very beginning, we trained the classiﬁer
by using all 264 centrality scores available for each in-
dividual and found a classiﬁcation accuracy of about 60-
65%, regardless for the type of centrality proﬁle used (i.e.
multiplex, full-band and typical-band). One of the main
advantage of random forest classiﬁcation is that it also
ranks the features based on their classiﬁcation power,
i.e. on the degree of discrimination they have. We cap-
italize on this precious information to perform a second
round of classiﬁcation, this time using only top-ranked
features instead of the full set. We varied between 10

regions

To gain further insights, we focus on the regions corre-
sponding to the top 30 ROIs of the multiplex centrality
proﬁle, where we attained the maximum discrimination
between control and patient groups. The spatial distri-
bution of the corresponding brain’s regions are shown
in Fig. 4B. Anatomical information about these ROIs is
summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

Capi-
talizing on results from group discrimination using
centrality proﬁles, we investigate more in detail the role
of hub regions.
In particular, our interest is twofold.
On one hand, we wonder if the most central regions
obtained from multiplex and conventional
functional
networks are the same (it is worth remarking that
previous correlation analysis of centrality proﬁles does
not provide this information, because diﬀerences might
be due to low-ranked regions, for instance). On the
other hand we want to clarify which hub regions are
found only in healthy individuals, which ones are found
only in schizophrenic individuals and which ones are
found in both groups.

Hubs were identiﬁed as ROIs ranked in top 5% in terms
of group-averaged region centrality. Figure 5 shows the
spatial distributions in the brain of such hubs, for each
group, while the corresponding anatomical information
is reported in Supplementary Table 2.
In all cases we
found hub regions peculiar for each group and hubs re-
gions that are common to both groups. While signiﬁcant
diﬀerences are not observed between networks built from
conventional approaches, hubs from multiplex analysis
constitute a distinct set.

In both conventional networks, healthy-speciﬁc hubs
are located in medial superior frontal, lateral frontal cor-
tices and thalamus, whereas schizophrenic-speciﬁc hubs
are localized in posterior parts of the brain, such as
cuneus, precuneus, and superior temporal cortices. Hubs
shared by both groups are identiﬁed along the midline
of the brain, in particular the medial superior frontal,
precuneus and cingulate cortices. In the multiplex net-
work, healthy-speciﬁc hubs controls are located in ante-
rior cingulate, superior frontal, insula and superior tem-
poral cortices, whereas those pertaining to schizophrenic
patients are distributed over frontal, parietal and occip-
ital cortices. Hub regions shared by both groups groups
are localized in frontal, occipital cortices and cerebellum.
Notably, no hub region has been identiﬁed in the pre-
cuneus cortex, a region well known to function as a hub
in healthy individuals [31].

DISCUSSION

Resting state functional connectivity has been widely
investigated with fMRI in the past two decades. Since
the ﬁrst study conducted by Biswal et al. [36], functional

functional connectivity. The most central regions,
i.e.
hubs, identiﬁed in multiplex and conventional functional net-
works are shown (from top to bottom). Markers indicate
their locations, whereas panels from left-hand to right-hand

connectivity has been deﬁned as an inter-regional tempo-
ral correlation of fMRI signals that are preprocessed with
band-pass ﬁlters, removing frequency components below
0.01 and above 0.1 Hz. In fact, the power spectrum of
spontaneous ﬂuctuations of fMRI signals roughly follows
a 1/f power-law scaling [37], where powers in the higher
frequency range are relatively weaker than lower ones,
suggesting the hypothesis that only the lower frequency
range substantially contributes to brain’s function. How-
ever, recent studies have reported that conventionally ex-
cluded frequency bands might provide additional insights
on brain activity [16–18, 22, 23]. As a consequence, brain
functional networks exhibit a peculiar architecture, con-
sisting of a few regions acting as hubs, strongly dependent
on the frequency components of brain activity that con-
tribute to inter-regional interactions. However, a rigor-
ous method to identify such hubs in networks built from
diﬀerent frequency bands simultaneously is a challenging
problem remaining largely unexplored.

Our results, based on multiplex modeling and anal-
ysis of the brain activity, provide convincing evidence
that characterization of brain functional networks can
not prescind from considering the whole information ob-
served from diﬀerent frequency bands, simultaneously.
This crucial ﬁnding allows to exploit new theoretical and
computational tools for the analysis of brain activity and
opens a new direction towards a deeper understanding
of brain function and its operated integration. As a
ﬁrst hint of the power of the new methodology, we have
shown that multiplex characterization of brain regions,

in terms of network centrality, allows to ﬁnd new areas
of the brain that have never been classiﬁed as relevant in
brain’s functional integration (or the opposite). This is
the case of ROIs in the precuneus cortex, a well-known
region of highly central functional hubs
[31], that are
not found by our multiplex network analysis, reﬂecting
the importance of considering the whole information si-
multaneously, rather than aggregating or neglecting part
of it [27].

We wondered if this result could be exploited for prac-
tical applications, where the choice of speciﬁc frequency
bands might play a crucial role. We focused our atten-
tion on characterizing brain disorders in schizophrenic
patients, a research topic of great interest that has been
largely explored [12, 13, 38], although individual diagno-
sis based on brain imaging remains still undeveloped [32].
With the aid of the MRI technique, it has been recently
shown that regions aﬀected by schizophrenia are dis-
tributed across the brain [39, 40], impelling researchers
to move from the conventional perspective where the
causes of disorders are localized in speciﬁc areas, to
a wider perspective with emphasis on abnormality in
brain structural and functional connectivity [41]. Stud-
ies on structural connectivity provided evidences that
schizophrenic brains exhibit abnormal network architec-
ture, characterized by reduced hierarchical organization,
the loss of frontal hubs with emergence of non-frontal
hubs [12, 13] and degraded rich-club organization [38].
Methods not based on networks were able to provide sat-
isfactory performance in discriminating schizophrenic pa-
tients from the analysis of their brain activity [42, 43], al-
though they are often based on very complicated machine
learning algorithms and make use of heterogenous data
sources, thus not improving our understanding of brain
function. Here, we have found that multiplex central-
ity proﬁle of brain regions allow to discriminate between
control and schizophrenic groups of individuals more
accurately than centrality proﬁles calculated from net-
works obtained by using conventional approaches, such
as aggregating and/or disregarding the measured activ-
ity. Nevertheless, the discrimination accuracy is compa-
rable to other methods, with the additional advantage
of providing a framework facilitating the interpretation
of results, without relying on external data sources or
phenotypic information. In fact, we were able to identify
many regions distinctive of schizophrenic brains, some
of them localized where abnormality has been previously
suggested [32, 44]. The analysis of dissimilarities between
networks corresponding to diﬀerent layers of the multi-
plex functional network, conﬁrmed signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between healthy and schizophrenic individuals in speciﬁc
frequency ranges, including the higher ones. This ﬁnd-
ing demonstrates that brain activity in higher frequen-
cies provides unique information about functional inter-
action in the brain, even if their amplitudes are under-
represented in the power spectrum.

The proposed methodology suggests a guideline for fu-
ture studies designed to consider brain’s inter-regional

5

interactions at diﬀerent frequencies, encouraging the ap-
plication of other multiplex network measures to func-
tional networks obtained,
from variable
brain states.

METHODS

Overview of the data set and fMRI preprocessing.
The publicly available MR data set contributed by The
Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE)
was used in this study. The data set was downloaded
from the following repository:
http://fcon_1000.
projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/cobre.html.
It in-
cludes functional and anatomical MRI data acquired
from 72 Schizophrenic patients and 75 healthy controls
(age:
18–65 for both groups). One patient?s data
was discarded from all analyses due to the shortness
of the data length. The following pre-processing steps
were applied to functional MR images by using the
SPM8 package (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neu-
roscience, London, UK): motion-correction, slice-timing-
correction, spatial smoothing with Gaussian kernel (5-
mm full-width-at-half-maximum) and spatial normaliza-
tion. Signal ﬂuctuations of fMRI are driven by not only
neural but also physiological eﬀects – such as respira-
tion and cardiac pulsation – and environmental condi-
tions – such as scanner instabilities and subject motion.
These nuisance eﬀects can be canceled out by discard-
ing, for instance, the signal from the ROI centered in the
white matter, the signal from the ventricular ROI, and
the signal from the ROI located within the soft-tissue.
We have linearly removed these components after tem-
porally shifting them by optimal time-lags yielding the
highest correlation with the averaged signal of all gray
matter voxels [45].
Connectivity matrices. A set of 264 spherical ROIs
(5 mm radii) was used to extract the mean signal within
each ROI. For each individual, the coherence between all
pairs of in-ROI averaged signals was estimated in spe-
ciﬁc frequency bands, as described in the text. We kept
the edges between pairs of ROIs whose weight was sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent from a null model where observed sig-
nals were replaced by surrogates. More speciﬁcally, we
used the well-known iterative amplitude-adjusted Fourier
transform (IAAFT) algorithm to build surrogate time se-
ries preserving the power spectrum and the probability
density of the original ones, while removing higher-order

self-correlations. For each pair of ROIs i and j, we have
veriﬁed that the distribution of the weights obtained from
the null model corresponds to a Gaussian described by
sample mean µij and variance σ2
ij. Let wij indicate the
weight obtained from empirical data: we have calculated
the absolute Z score as zij = |wij−µij|/σij and discarded
all those edges for which zij < 3, corresponding to cross-
coherence not statistically signiﬁcant. We used the values
zij as entries of the resulting connectivity matrix.
Multiplex network model. A multilayer network al-
lows to encode diﬀerent types of interactions or relation-
ships among a set of nodes. More speciﬁcally, in the case
of our study we make use of multiplex networks to model
functional connectivity. In a multiplex network, the links
are of diﬀerent type: one can assign a diﬀerent “color”
to each type, thus obtained an edge-colored representa-
tion of the network. In this type of architectures, nodes
exist in one or more layers, i.e.
it is not required that
all nodes exist in all layers. Correlation networks, as the
ones used in this study, deﬁne edge-colored graphs where
each layer encodes the correlations observed in a speciﬁc
frequency band. However, it has been shown that by
interconnecting nodes with their replicas across layers,
the resulting interconnected multiplex network can be
described by an adjacency tensor [25] with components
M iα
jβ , an object generalizing the well-known concept of
adjacency matrix to higher orders, encoding connections
between node i in layer α and node j in layer β. For in-
jβ = 0 for i (cid:54)= j and
terconnected multiplex networks, M iα
simultaneously α (cid:54)= β. The presence of interconnections
allows to exploit tensorial algebra to generalize many
single-layer network descriptors, from centrality [27] to
mesoscale structure [24, 46]. However, it is not always
possible to assign a weight to inter-layer links by using
the data, and it is common to parameterize the intensity
of interconnections [47, 48], i.e. M iα
jβ = D for i = j and
simultaneously α (cid:54)= β, to study the resulting intercon-
nected multiplex network as a function of this parameter
D. This is exactly the case of the present study, where
the choice of D depends on the analysis of interest.
Structural reducibility of brain multiplex func-
tional network. The analysis of structural reducibility
of a multilayer network allows to ﬁnd layers that pro-
vide redundant topological information, suggesting how
to merge some layers with other ones, to obtain an opti-
mal multilayer network [26]. The whole procedure can be
summarized as follows: i) compute the distance (based on
quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence) between all pairs
of layers; ii) perform hierarchical clustering of layers us-
ing such distance matrix and use changes in the relative
entropy q(•) as the quality function for the resulting par-
tition; iii) ﬁnally, choose the partition which maximizes
the quality function, i.e. the distinguishability from the
fully aggregated graph obtained by summing up the ad-
jacency matrices of all layers. It is worth remarking that
this analysis is independent on the choice of interconnec-
tions weight, i.e. it does not depend on D. Here, we do
not enter into the details of the whole method; instead

we focus on the Jensen-Shannon distance, that is a key
measure for two analyses presented in this study.

The components A[α]

A[α] – encoding layer α – are obtained from the compo-

ij = M iα
jα.
Here, A[α]
ij > 0 if there is correlation between ROIs i
and j in the frequency band represented by α. The Von

The similarity of two layers can be calculated in terms
of diﬀerences in their entropy. Given two rescaled Lapla-
cian matrices L[α] and L[β], it is possible to quantify to
which extent layer α is diﬀerent from layer β by their
Kullback-Liebler divergence, deﬁned by
DKL(L[α]||L[β]) = Tr[L[α](log2(L[α])−log2(L[β]))], (3)
encoding the information gained about L[β] when the
expectation is based only on L[α]. This divergence is not
a metric and a more suitable dissimilarity measure is the
Jensen-Shannon divergence, deﬁned by
DJS(L[α]||L[β]) =
DKL(L[α]||L[µ]) +

usually called Jensen–Shannon distance, takes values in

provides a very powerful measure of dissimilarity between
layers.
Random forest classiﬁcation. Machine learning has
been used to train a classiﬁer to distinguish between con-
trol and schizophrenic individuals. We used the random
forest classiﬁer [35], well-known for its robustness and for
facilitating the interpretation of results. We have ﬁxed to
5 the maximum number of terminal nodes trees the forest
can have and to 2 the number of variables randomly sam-
pled as candidates at each split. We have veriﬁed that
forests consisting of 700 trees where enough to reach sta-
ble results within this setup.

obtained in the limit t −→ ∞, provides the PageR-
ank centrality for interconnected multiplex networks. To
compute the overall PageRank of a node, accounting for
the whole interconnected topology, we can safely sum
up the stationary probabilities π(cid:63)

obtain the components of the centrality proﬁle vector

jβ used in our analysis. It is worth remarking

that the interconnection weight used for this purpose is
D = 24.7708, the one yielding the highest classiﬁcation
accuracy.

Supplementary Figure 1. Maximizing classiﬁcation
accuracy. Layers in the multiplex functional network are
interconnected to allow the calculation of layer’s and node’s
properties. However, the weight of such inter-layer links can
not be deduced from the data. At the same time, not all
ROIs have enough discriminant power and using sub-sets of
them reduces the noise and generally improves the classiﬁ-
cation. We have chosen the value of the inter-layer strength
(D = 24.7708) and the size of an appropriate sub-set of ROIs
(30) where maximum classiﬁcation accuracy is achieved (see
Methods for details).

about its value, we used random forest to learn also which
value of D would be more suitable for calculations.

We have performed a ﬁrst exploratory classiﬁcation us-
ing a leave-one-out approach to maximize the amount of
data used for training the classiﬁer. The result of each
classiﬁcation, corresponding to exactly one diﬀerent indi-
vidual (without replacement) left out, was accompanied
by the importance assigned by the classiﬁer to each ROI
in terms of mean decrease in its Gini index. Therefore, for
each individual and each value of D, we have ranked the
ROIs according to this measure and, eventually, summed
up the ranks corresponding to all classiﬁcations.

The result of the exploratory classiﬁcation was an over-
all ranking suggesting which ROIs, in general, have been
more crucial than others in the classiﬁcation process.
Therefore, we performed a second classiﬁcation round by
using only the top ROIs according to the above rank-
ing. We ﬁrst varied the number of kept features and
the value of D, to ﬁnd the values with best classiﬁcation
performances in terms of accuracy (see Supplementary
Fig. 1). The numerical analysis indicated that the best
classiﬁcation is achieved for interconnections weight close
to 24.7708 and about 30 top ROIs: that value of D and
that sub-set of ROIs have been used for analysis reported
in the text.

Using a similar approach, we have compared the best
performance obtained from the full multiplex functional
network (12 layers) against multiplex functional networks
obtained by keeping layers in the typical band (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2) and against classiﬁer trained by includ-
ing phenotypic data (Supplementary Fig. 3). In all cases,
the classiﬁcation obtained using the full multiplex func-
tional network was equal or better than the other ones.
ROIs PageRank centrality. PageRank is a mea-
sure of node’s centrality originally introduced by Google
founders to rank Web pages according to their impor-
tance in the Internet [33, 34]. The algorithm consider
a random walker exploring the network with the follow-
ing rules: 85% of times the walker jumps from the cur-
rent node to one chosen with uniform probability from
the neighborhood, whereas 15% of times the walker is
allowed to jump to any node of the network, with uni-
form probability. The stationary probability of ﬁnding
the walker in a speciﬁc node is then used to rank the
importance of nodes in the network, the rationale being
that central nodes have high number of incoming links
from other important nodes.

The natural extension of the PageRank algorithm to
the context of multiplex networks has been recently intro-
duced [27] and proved to perform better than its single-
layer counterpart in some applications. Let us indicate
with Riα
jβ the transition tensor, governing the dynamics of
a random walker jumping to neighboring nodes with rate
0.85 and teleporting to any other node in the network
with rate 0.15. This rank-4 tensor is given by

Supplementary Figure 2. Discrimination performance
of two diﬀerent multiplex functional networks. A new
multiplex network, consisting only of the layers correspond-
ing to the typical frequency range, has been built and used for
discriminating between control and patient groups. The sta-
tistical indicators of the discrimination are compared against
the full multiplex functional network discussed in the text,
providing better overall discrimination. Bars indicate stan-
dard errors.

of the multiplex functional networks with and with-
out phenotypic information. The statistical indicators

tained from the full multiplex functional network before and
after including phenotypic information in the machine learn-
ing process. The results are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, indi-
cating that phenotypic data is redundant in this case and does
not improve discrimination. Bars indicate standard errors.
