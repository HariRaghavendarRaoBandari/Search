GENERATING FUNCTIONS ON COVERING GROUPS

DAVID GINZBURG

Abstract. In this paper we prove Conjecture 1.2 in [B-F]. This enables us to establish
the meromorphic continuation of the standard partial L function LS(s, π(n)). Here, π(n) is
a genuine irreducible cuspidal representation of the group GL(n)

(A).

r

1. introduction

Let A denote the ring of adeles of a global ﬁeld F . Assume that F contains the n roots
of unity. Let GL(n)
r (A) denote the n fold metaplectic cover of the group GLr(A). Let π(n)
denote a genuine irreducible cuspidal representation of GL(n)
r (A). As explained in [B-F], to
this representation one can attach the partial standard L function, denoted by LS(s, π(n)).
In [B-F] the authors introduced a global integral to study this L function. Their idea
was to take the well known Rankin-Seleberg convolution of two cuspidal representation
of GLr(A) and GLn(A). For the constructions of these Rankin-Selberg integrals, and the
motivations for the adopted construction in the covering groups, we refer to [B-F]. Then, they
replaced the cuspidal representation of GLn(A) by the Theta representation Θ(n)
n . This last
representation was constructed in [K-P]. For example, if r > n, the construction suggested
in [B-F] is given by

Here φ is a vector in the space of π(n), and θ is a vector in the space of Θ(n)
n . The group
Vr,n, and the character ψVr,n are deﬁned in the last section.
In fact in [B-F] the authors
concentrated on the case when r < n, but up to some modiﬁcations as explained in [B-F]
Section 2, the idea is the same.

A straight-forward unfolding, implies that for Re(s) large, integral (1) is equal to

Here Wφ denotes the Whittaker coeﬃcient of φ, and similarly we deﬁne Wθ.

Since the Whittaker coeﬃcient Wφ is not factorizable, it is not obvious that the above
integral represents an Euler product. To show that it does, one needs to apply the method
referred to as the New Way which was developed in [PS-R]. See [B-F] for a discussion and
references for this method.

In our context, to deduce that integral (2) is Eulerian one can proceed in two steps. The
ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd a generating function for the unramiﬁed local L function L(s, π(n)). See
[B-F] page 5 for its deﬁnition. In [B-F], such a function was introduced, and was denoted

from integral (2), and to show that this local integral is independent of the choice of the local
Whittaker function attached to the local component of φ. To do that one needs to compute

by e∆s. The second step is to use this function to compute a local integral which is obtained
the Whittaker function of e∆s. This is done in [B-F] for the cases r = n = 2, 3. The general
a diﬀerent realization for the function e∆s. This realization makes the proof of the stated

conjecture relatively simple. The new realization is described in Section 2 and is given by a
certain unique functional deﬁned on the local Theta representation Θ(n)
nr deﬁned on the group
GL(n)
nr , which we denote
by W (n)
r we obtain a function on that

nr . We then use this functional to deﬁne a function on the group GL(n)

In this paper we prove Conjecture 1.2 of [B-F] in complete generality. To do this we give

nr (h). Here h ∈ GL(n)

nr . Restricting to the group GL(n)

group which we use to give the new expression for e∆s. Thus our result contains two parts.

The ﬁrst is the proof that the function W (n)
is indeed the generating
function for the standard L function. This we do in Proposition 2. The second, and the
main result of this paper, is to obtain the desired expression for the Whittaker function of
the generating function. This we do in Theorem 2, which is Conjecture 1.2 in [B-F]. In both
cases the computations are quite straight forward and are done by a repeated application of
Lemma 1 and Corollary 1 stated and proved in Subsection 2.1.

nr (h) restricted to GL(n)

r

As mentioned above, the global result and some of the computations done in [B-F] assumes
that r < n. This is just a technical point. The authors of [B-F] were well aware that their
construction works for all r and n. To complete their result, in the last section we give some
details in the other two cases, that is the case when r > n and r = n.

To summarize, combining [B-F] with our result we have

Theorem 1. Let π(n) denote an irreducible cuspidal representation of the group GL(n)
r (A).
Then the partial L function LS(s, π(n)) has a meromorphic continuation to the whole complex
plane. When r 6= n this partial L function is holomorphic. When r = n it can have at most
a simple pole at s = 1.

As a ﬁnal remark we mention that in fact we do expect that the partial L function
LS(s, π(n)) will also be holomorphic in the case when r = n. From the global integral given
in the last section we deduce that if this L function has a simple pole at s = 1, then π(n)
will be isomorphic to Θ(n)

n . This we believe cannot happen.

2. Generating functions

The main references for this section are [B-F] and [K-P]. Fix a positive integer n > 1. Let
F denote a local nonarchimedean ﬁeld which contains the n roots of unity. Let GL(n)
r denote
the metaplectic n fold cover of the group GLr. Let π(n) denote an unramiﬁed representation
of GL(n)
attached to a character χ of the torus Tr of GLr. This is explained in [B-F] page 5.
Assuming that χ is in general position, one can attach to π(n), the local L function which is

r

L(s, π(n)) =

i=1(1 − χn

i (p)q−s)

Qr

Here p is a generator of the maximal ideal in the ring of integers of F , and q−1 = |p|F . Also,
s is a complex variable.

In [B-F] formula (1.4) the function e∆s(h) is deﬁned. This is a function of GL(n)

Proposition 1.1 in [B-F] states that for Re(s) large,

r

, and

Z

GLr

ωπ(n)(h)e∆s(h)dh = L(s, π(n))

(4)

(5)

Here, ωπ(n), denoted by σ in [B-F], is the spherical function attached to π(n). Thus ωπ(n)
is a Kr bi-invariant function of GL(n)
r where Kr is the maximal compact subgroup of GLr
embedded in GL(n)
determined by Proposition 1.1 in [B-F]. This function is referred to as the generating function
for the standard L function of the group GL(n)

as described in [B-F]. As is well known, the function e∆s(h) is uniquely

.

r

r

We will give a diﬀerent realization of the function e∆s(h). To do that let Θ(n)

nr denote
the local unramiﬁed Theta representation of GL(n)
nr as constructed in [K-P]. Thus, this
representation is the unramiﬁed sub-representation of IndGL(n)
Bnr . Here, Bnr is the Borel
δ
B(n)
subgroup of GLnr. This representation is not generic, however it still has a certain unique
functional deﬁned on it. To describe this functional, let Unr denote the unipotent radical
of the parabolic subgroup of GLnr whose Levi part is GLr × GLr × . . . × GLr. In term of
matrices the group Unr consists of all matrices of the form

n−1

Here I is the r × r identity matrix, and Xi,j ∈ M atr×r.

Let ψ denote an unramiﬁed character of F . Deﬁne a character ψUnr of Unr as follows. For
u ∈ Unr as above, deﬁne ψUnr (u) = ψ(tr(X1,2 + X2,3 + · · · + Xn−1,n)). The stabilizer of ψUnr
inside GLr × GLr × . . . × GLr is the group GL∆
r embedded diagonally. The embedding of
GL∆
inside GLnr is given by g 7→ diag(g, g, . . . , g).

it is not identically zero. Here wJ is the Weyl element wJ = diag(Jn, Jn, . . . , Jn) ∈ GLnr
where Jn is the longest Weyl element of GLn. The Weyl element w0 is deﬁned as the element
whose (a + bn, (a − 1)r + b + 1) entry is one for all 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 0 ≤ b ≤ r − 1, and zero
elsewhere. Matrix multiplication implies that wJ w0 is the shortest Weyl element of GLnr
with the property that for all u ∈ U 0
nr, we have that wuw−1 is a lower unipotent matrix.

Θ(n)
nr (e) 6= 0. This will follow from the computation which we
will perform in the next Proposition.

nr , one can easily show that W (n)

Before doing that, it will be convenient to perform a simple computation which we will

refer to several times. We will do it in the following subsection,

2.1. A local computation. Let F denote a local ﬁeld. Given a root α associated with
the group GLb, we will denote by xα(l) the one dimensional unipotent subgroup of GLb
associated with this root. Assume that α and β are two roots such that α + β is also a root.
Thus, we have xα(z)xβ(l) = xβ(l)xα(z)xα+β(lz). Let h(a) denote a one dimensional torus of
GLb which satisﬁes the property h(a)−1xα(z)h(a) = xα(a−1z) for all a ∈ F ∗.

Let f denote a function deﬁned on GLb(F ) which satisﬁes the property

(7)

f (xβ(l1)xα+β(l2)gk) = ψ(−l2)f (g)

for all k ∈ Kb, where Kb is the standard maximal compact subgroup of GLb.

Our goal in this subsection is to compute the integral

I =Z

F 2

f (xα(z)xβ(l)h(a))ψ(ǫl)dzdl

Here ǫ = 0, −1. We have

Lemma 1. We have, I = f (h(a)xα(−a−1ǫ)) = f (xα(−ǫ)h(a)).

Proof. Since f is right Kb invariant, then

I =Z

f (xα(z)xβ(l)h(a)xα(m))ψ(ǫl)dmdzdl

Conjugating xα(m) to the left, and using the above assumptions on the commutation rela-

tions and properties (7), we obtain the integral R ψ(−lam)dm as inner integration. Here m

is integrated over |m| ≤ 1. Hence we may restrict the integration domain in integral I to
the domain |la| ≤ 1.

properties (7), we obtain

|(z+ǫ)a−1|≤1

Writing a−1z = a−1z + ǫa−1 − ǫa−1, we obtain

2.2. On the generating function. In this subsection we will prove that the generating
function can be expressed in term of the function W (n)
nr .

Embed g ∈ GLr in GLnr as g 7→ g0 = diag(g, Ir, . . . , Ir). We have

nr consisting of all

U 1
nr

f (wJ w0ut0)ψUnr (u)du

We do this by using Lemma 1 several times. It is convenient to use the following notations.
For all integers 1 ≤ a, b ≤ nr and all m ∈ F , let xa,b(m) = Inr + mea,b. Here ea,b is the
matrix of size nr which has a one in the (a, b) entry, and zero elsewhere.

In integral (11) consider the integrations over the variables X1,2[r, r − 1] and v0[r − 1, r],
where the last variable indicates the (r − 1, r) entry of v0. In the notations of Subsection
2.1, let xα(z) = xr,r−1(z) where z = X1,2[r, r − 1], and let xβ(l) = xr−1,r(l) where l =
v0[r − 1, r]. With these notations we have xα+β(m) = xr−1,2r−1(m) and from the deﬁnition
of the character ψUnr we have ψUnr (xα+β(m)) 6= 1. Hence, all the conditions of Lemma 1 are
satisﬁed with ǫ = 0 and h(a) = h(ar) = diag(Ir−1, ar, Inr−r). From this we deduce that in the
integral (11), we may restrict the domain of integration to the group Vr with the condition
that v0[r − 1, r] = 0, and to the group U 0

nr with the condition X1,2[r, r − 1] = 0.

In general, we apply this process in the following order. Fix r + 1 ≤ j ≤ 2r − 1. Then for
all j − r + 1 ≤ i ≤ r, set xα(z) = xi,j(z) with z = X1,2[i, j − r], and xβ(l) = xj−r,i(l) with
l = v0[j − r, i]. With these notations we have xα+β(m) = xj−r,j(m). Since ψUnr is not trivial
on xα+β(m), we can apply Lemma 1 with ǫ = 0. The end result of this repeated process is
that integral (11) is equal to integral (12).

Conjugating by w0, write w0U 1

nrw−1
0 = U 2
nr are deﬁned
as follows. First, identify the group U 2
nr with r copies of the group Vn. Here Vn is deﬁned to
be the group of all upper unipotent matrices of GLn. The embedding of U 2
nr inside GLnr is
given by (vn,1, vn,2, . . . , vn,r) 7→ diag(vn,1, vn,2, . . . , vn,r). Here vn,i ∈ Vn. To deﬁne the group
U 3

nr, consider the unipotent group generated by all matrices of the form

nr is generated by all matrices as in (13) which

For v ∈ Vn, let ψVn(v) denote the Whittaker character of the group Vn. This character is

deﬁned as follows. Given v = (v[i, j]) ∈ Vn, then

(14)

ψVn(v) = ψ(v[1, 2] + v[2, 3] + · · · + v[n − 1, n])

Let u2 = diag(vn,1, vn,2, . . . , vn,r) ∈ U 2

We claim that integral (16) is equal to α(t)fW (w0t0w−1

application of Corollary 1. Indeed, ﬁx 2 ≤ i ≤ r, where we ﬁrst start with i = r, then i = r−1
and so on. Let 1 ≤ k ≤ i − 1. Assume that l1 and l2 are such that Yi,k[l1, l2] is a variable
in the domain of integration in integral (16). In the notations of Subsection 2.1, let xα(z) =
x(n−1)i+l1,n(k−1)+l2(z) with z = Yi,k[l1, l2], and let xβ(m) = xn(k−1)+l2,(n−1)i+l1+1(m). Then,
xα+β(l) = x(n−1)i+l1,(n−1)i+l1+1(l), and from the properties of fW , we have fW (xα+β(l)g) =
ψ(−l)fW (g). Applying Corollary 1 several times in the indicated order, the above claim

3. The Whittaker functional of the generating function

In this section we compute the Whittaker functional of the function W (n)

nr (g0). Here the
notations are as in Section 2, but we assume that r < n. We make this assumption to
get a precise proof of Conjecture 1.2 in [B-F]. The case when r ≥ n is similar and will
be dealt with in the next section. Embed g ∈ GLr in GLn as g 7→ diag(g, In−r). Let
g0 = diag(g, In, . . . , In) ∈ GLnr, where In appears r − 1 times.

Let Vr denote the standard maximal unipotent subgroup of GLr, and let ψ−1
Whittaker character of Vr. See equation (14) for the deﬁnition of ψVr . Let W (n)
Whittaker function of the Theta function deﬁned on GL(n)

Proof. We will consider the case when r = n − 1. This is the hardest case. When r <
n − 1 the computations are similar but simpler. Since we will use some of the notations
introduced in the previous Sections, we will keep writing r and n even though we assume
that r = n − 1. By the Iwasawa decomposition, it is enough to prove identity (19) for
g = t = diag(a1, a2, . . . , an−1). Notice, that from the left invariant properties of W (n)
nr and
W (n)

Θn , we may assume that |ai| ≤ 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.
We start by plugging integral (6) into the left hand side of identity (19). Doing so, we

integral (11) is equal to integral (12). The only diﬀerence, is that because of the character
ψ−1
in integral (20), then for the suitable variables in Vr, we need to use Lemma 1 with
Vr
ǫ = −1 and not with ǫ = 0 as in the proof of Proposition 2. This explains the element δ0.

that integral (12) is equal to integral (16), we deduce that integral (21) is equal to

Here the group U 3

we assume that r = n − 1. Also, we have δ1(t) =Qn−1

is obtained by conjugating δ0 by w0 and t0.

nr and α(t) are deﬁned before integral (16), and we remind the reader that
i ). This element

i=2 x(i−1)n+1,(i−2)n+2(a−1

At this point, for all 2 ≤ j ≤ n − 1 we will introduce an integral which we denote by
Ij. To do that we ﬁrst ﬁx some notations. Let tj = diag(Aj,j, Aj,j+1, . . . , Aj,n−1, In, . . . , In)
denote the torus element of GLnr where Aj,j = diag(a1, . . . , aj, In−j) and for all j + 1 ≤
i ≤ n − 1 we deﬁne Aj,i = diag(Ij, ai, In−j−1). Notice that when j = n − 1, we get tj =
diag(An−1,n−1, In, . . . , In) = t0. Next we deﬁne αj(t) = |aj+1a2
|n−2, where
we set αn−1(t) = 1. Finally, we deﬁne a set of subgroups Un,j, and a set of characters ψUn,j
deﬁned on these groups. The deﬁnition is inductive, so we we start with Un,2. Consider the
group U 3
nr with r = n − 1, as was deﬁned right after equation (13). Let Un,2 denote the
subgroup of U 3
nr with the extra condition that Yn−1,i = 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2. Assuming
we deﬁned Un,j−1 we deﬁne Un,j as the subgroup of Un,j−1 consisting of matrices of the form
(13) such that Yn−j+1,i = 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − j, and also satisﬁes the condition Yi,l[b, j] = 0
for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n − j, 1 ≤ l ≤ i − 1 and 1 ≤ b ≤ n. The character ψUn,j is deﬁned as follows.

j+3 · · · an−j−1

For u ∈ Un,j written as in equation (13), we set ψUn,j (u) = ψ(Pn−j

With these notations, for all 2 ≤ j ≤ n − 1 we set

i=2 Yi,i−1[j − 1, j + 1]).

Ij = αj(t) Z

fW (tju)ψUn,j (u)du

We will prove that I2 = I1, and that for all 2 ≤ j ≤ n − 1, we have Ij = Ij−1. This will
complete the proof of the Theorem. Indeed, proving the above implies that the left hand
side of equation (19) is equal to In−1. Since αn−1(t) = 1, the group Un,n−1 is the trivial
group, and tn−1 = t0, we deduce that In−1 = fW (t0). But as in equation (17) we obtain that
fW (t0) equals the right hand side of equation (19).

δ1(t) = Qn−1

i=2 x(i−2)n+2,(i−1)n+1(ai)Qn−1

We prove that I2 = I1. Since |ai| ≤ 1, we obtain the following Iwasawa decomposition
i=2 hi(ai) =
diag(B2,1, B2,2, . . . , B2,n−1). Here B2,1 = diag(1, a2, In−2), for 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 2 we have B2,i =
diag(a−1
n−1, In−1). Conjugating in I1 the matrix δ1(t)k−1 to
left, and using the left invariant properties of fW , we obtain by matrix multiplication

i=2 hi(ai)k. Here k ∈ Knr, and we have Qn−1

Here we use the fact that w0t0w−1

obtained from a change of variables when we conjugate the torus Qn−1

The product of this factor by α1(t) is equal to α2(t). The character ψU 3
follows. For u3 ∈ U 3
I2 = I1, we need to show that we can restrict the support of integration from U 3

i=2 hi(ai) = t2. The factor of |a2a3 . . . an−1|−(n−2) is
i=2 hi(ai) across U 3

In other words, we need to show that for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2, the integration over all variables
in Yn−1,i is in Knr. This is done as in the proof of Proposition 2 while showing that integral
(16) reduces to the left hand side of identity (17). Indeed, from the deﬁnition of the torus
t2, given a variable Yn−1,i[l1, l2], we can ﬁnd a one dimensional unipotent subgroup xβ(m) so
that we can apply Corollary 1. Thus I2 = I1.

The next step is to prove that Ij = Ij−1. The ﬁrst step is to prove that we can integrate
over a smaller unipotent group. Let Un,j−1,1 denote the subgroup of Un,j−1 consisting of all
matrices which also satisﬁes Yi,l[b, j] = 0 for all 3 ≤ i ≤ n − j + 1, 1 ≤ l ≤ i − 2 and
1 ≤ b ≤ j − 1. To show that we can reduce the domain of integration from Un,j−1 to Un,j−1,1
we apply Corollary 1.
In the notations of this Corollary, let xα(z) = xn(i−1)+b,n(l−1)+j(z)
with z = Yi,l[b, j], and let xβ(m) = xnl+j−2,n(i−1)+b(m). Notice that in this case the root
α + β corresponds to the one dimensional unipotent subgroup xnl+j−2,n(l−1)+j(c), which is a
subgroup of Un,j−1,1. Moreover, the character ψUn,j−1 is not trivial on this subgroup. Hence,
the conditions of the Corollary 1 are satisﬁed. We mention that the order for which we apply
this Corollary is important. We ﬁrst vary 3 ≤ i ≤ n − j + 1 and ﬁx l = 1. Then we repeat
the same process with l = 2 and so on.

The second step is to show that Ij−1 is equal to

(23)

fW (tj−1uδj−1(t))ψUn,j−1(u)du

αj−1(t) Z

Un,j−1,2

all 2 ≤ i ≤ n − j + 1. The matrix δj−1(t) = Qn−j+1

Here Un,j−1,2 is the subgroup of Un,j−1,1 which satisﬁes the condition that Yi,i−1[j − 1, j] for
j+i−2). To derive
integral (23) we apply Lemma 1 with xα(z) = xn(i−1)+j−1,n(i−2)+j(z) with z = Yi,i−1[j − 1, j]
and xβ(l) = x(i−1)n+j−2,(i−1)n+j−1(l). The next step is to perform an Iwasawa decomposition
for δj−1(t) in integral (23). This is done as with δ1(t) and we obtain

x(i−1)n+j−1,n(i−2)+j(a−1

i=2

δj−1(t) =

n−j+1Yi=2

and Bj−1,n−j+1 = diag(Ij−2, a−1
matrix δj−1(t)k−1 to the left, we obtain

h′
i(aj+i−2) = diag(Bj−1,1, Bj−1,2, . . . , Bj−1,n−j+1, In, . . . , In),
j+i−2, aj+i−1, In−j) for 2 ≤ i ≤ n − j,
n−1, In−j+1). Plugging this into integral (23) and conjugate the

(24)

fW (tju)ψUn,j (u)du

αj(t) Z

Un,j−1,2

Here, we obtain the factor of |ajaj+1 . . . an−1|−(n−2) from the conjugation of the toral part of
δj−1(t)k−1 across Un,j−1,2. This combined with αj−1(t) gives the factor αj(t) in integral (24).
Notice also that the conjugation by the unipotent part of δj−1(t)k−1 changes the additive
character to ψUn,j . This is well deﬁned. Indeed, notice that Un,j is a subgroup Un,j−1,2 and
we can view ψUn,j as a character of Un,j−1,2 by extending it trivially. Finally, we have the
h′
i(aj+i−2) = tj. To show that integral (24) equals Ij, we need to show
that we may restrict the domain of integration from Un,j−1,2 to Un,j. We do so using Corollary
1. Indeed, the group Un,j is the subgroup of Un,j−1,2 obtained by setting Yn−j+1,l = 0 for

identity tj−1Qn−j+1

all 1 ≤ l ≤ n − j and Yi,i−1[b, j] = 0 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n − j and 1 ≤ b ≤ j − 2. To
show that we may restrict the integration over Un,j−1,2 to the subgroup obtained by setting
Yn−j+1,l = 0, we argue in a similar way as in the reduction from the group U 3
nr to Un,2 as
was done right after integral (22). Then, ﬁnally to obtain the group Un,j we use Corollary
1 with xα(z) = xn(i−1)+b,n(i−2)+j(z) where z = Yi,i−1[b, j] and xn(i−2)+j,n(i−1)+b+1(m). Here
2 ≤ i ≤ n − j and 1 ≤ b ≤ j − 2.

4. The case when r ≥ n

As mentioned in the introduction, the authors of [B-F] were well aware that the situation
when r ≥ n is similar. Since they do not specify this case explicitly, we brieﬂy mention the
global constructions and show how a similar result to Theorem 2 holds in this case.

n denote the Theta representation of the group GL(n)

Assume ﬁrst that r > n. Let π(n) denote a cuspidal representation of the group GL(n)

r (A).
Let Θ(n)
n (A). Then we consider the global
integral (1) introduced in the introduction. The group Vr,n is deﬁned as follows. Recall that
Vr is the standard maximal unipotent subgroup of GLr. Then, Vr,n is the subgroup of Vr
consisting of all matrices v = (vi,j) ∈ Vr such that vi,j = 0 for all 2 ≤ j ≤ n + 1. The
character ψVr,n is deﬁned by ψVr,n(v) = ψ(vn+1,n+2 + vn+2,n+3 + · · · + vr−1,r). It follows from
the cuspidality of φ that integral (1) converges for all s. A similar unfolding as in [B-F]
Section 2, implies that for Re(s) large, integral (1) is equal to integral (2).

Next we consider the case when r = n. In this case the global integral is given by

φ(g)θ(g)E(g, s)dg

Zr(A)GLr (F )\GLr (A)

Here Zr is the subgroup of Z, the center of GLr, which consists of scalar matrices which are
r powers. For simplicity we assume that all representations have a trivial central character.
Also, E(g, s) is the Eisenstein series deﬁned on the group GLr(A) and is associated with
the induced representation IndGLr(A)
δs
P . Here P is the maximal parabolic subgroup of GLr
whose Levi part is GLr−1 × GL1. Unfolding this integral, by ﬁrst unfolding the Eisenstein
series, we obtain for Re(s) large, that integral (25) is equal to

P (A)

(25)

(26)

Z

Z

Wφ(g)Wθ(g)f (g, s)dg

Here f (g, s) is a section in the above induced representation.

Zr(A)Vr (A)\GLr (A)

Next we study the local unramiﬁed computation corresponding to the integrals (2) and
(26). Since the Whittaker coeﬃcient of the representation π(n) is not factorizable, it is not
clear that these integrals are Eulerian. However, as explained in [B-F], if we can prove similar
results to Proposition 2 and to Theorem 2, the so call New way method would imply that
these integrals are indeed factorizable. As for Proposition 2, it is clear that it holds for all
values of r and n.

As for Theorem 2, this is not the case for all matrices g ∈ GL(n)

. Assuming r ≥ n, denote
by T0 the subgroup of GLr which consists of all diagonal matrices t = diag(a1, a2, . . . , ar)
such that |ai| ≤ 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and |ai| = 1 for all n + 1 ≤ i ≤ r. Let T (n)
0 denote the inverse
image of T0 inside GL(n)
r which can be written
r

r,0 denote all elements g ∈ GL(n)

. Let GL(n)

r

as g = vtk where v ∈ Vr, t ∈ T (n)
subgroup of GLr. With these notations we have
Theorem 3. Assume that r ≥ n. Then, for all g ∈ GL(n)

Proof. The proof of this Theorem is the same as the proof of Theorem 2, and so we will only
indicate the end result. Using the Iwasawa decomposition, we may assume that g0 = t0 =
diag(t, Ir, . . . , Ir) where t = (a1, . . . , ar).

Deﬁning similar integrals Ij as in Theorem 2, we prove that the left hand side of in-
tegral (27) is equal to fW (t′
0 = diag(A1, A2, . . . , Ar−n+1, In, . . . , In). Here A1 =
diag(a1, . . . , an) and for all 2 ≤ i ≤ r − n + 1 we have Ai = diag(In−1, an+i−1). Applying the
factorization of equation (17), we obtain the identity

Θn (Ai)

From the properties of the Whittaker function, we deduce that for all 2 ≤ i ≤ r − n + 1 we
have W (n)

Θn (Ai) = 0 unless |an+i−1| = 1. From this the Theorem follows.

(cid:3)

Notice that this Theorem is enough to prove that the corresponding local integrals of

integrals (2) and (26), are Eulerian. Indeed, the local version of integral (2) is given by

(28)

Z

Wφ(cid:18)g

Ir−n(cid:19) Wθ(g)|detg|s− r−n

2 dg

Vr\GLr

Here φ is a vector in the local component of π(n)
ν where ν is a place where all data is
unramiﬁed. Similarly for θ. Also, Wφ is any local Whittaker functional deﬁned on the
representation π(n)
. Similarly Wθ is the Whittaker functional deﬁned on the space of Θ(n)
n,ν.
It is known that for the representation Θ(n)
n,ν this Whittaker functional is unique ( see [K-P]).
However, this need not be the case for the representation π(n)

.

ν

ν

Applying the Iwasawa decomposition to the quotient Vr\GLr, the domain of integration in
integral (28) is reduced to the torus Tr of GLr. However, because of the Whittaker functional

Ir−n(cid:19) is zero unless t ∈ T0. Hence, we can apply Theorem 3 to deduce

properties, Wφ(cid:18)t

that integral (2) is indeed Eulerian.

A similar argument applies to integral (26). Indeed, using the properties of the Whittaker
function, we can choose representatives for the quotient Zr\Tr to be in the group T0. Hence,
once again we can apply Theorem 3.
