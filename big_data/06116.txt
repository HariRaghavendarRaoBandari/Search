Abstract

In this paper we describe the subcritical contact process on Zd for large times,
starting with all sites infected. The conﬁguration is described in terms of the macro-
scopic locations of infected regions in space and the relative positions of infected
sites in each such region.

1 Introduction

We consider the classical contact process on Zd, brieﬂy described as follows. The state at
time t is a subset ηt ⊆ Zd, or equivalently an element ηt ∈ {0, 1}Zd. Each infected site x
(i.e. x ∈ ηt) heals spontaneously (i.e. is removed from ηt) at rate 1. Each healthy site x
(i.e. x 6∈ ηt) gets infected (i.e. is added to ηt) at rate given by the number of its nearest
neighbors y that are infected at time t, multiplied by λ > 0. The number λ is the only
parameter of this time evolution. For A ⊆ Zd, we denote by (ηA
t )t>0 the process starting
from η0 = A. When A is random and has distribution µ, we denote the process by ηµ
t .
When A = {x} we write ηx
The contact process is one of the simplest interacting particle systems that exhibit a phase
transition. There exists a non-trivial critical value 0 < λc < ∞ such that the probability
that an infection starting from a single site propagate inﬁnitely is positive when λ > λc
and zero when λ < λc. See [Lig05, Lig99] for background on this and related models.

t and when A = Zd we omit the superindex.

Hereafter we consider the subcritical case, and assume that 0 < λ < λc is ﬁxed.
In order to see something in this phase, we have to start with an inﬁnite initial conﬁgu-
ration, and search for the infected sites. In one dimension it is common to start from a
conﬁguration that is inﬁnite only to the left, and consider the “contact process seen from
the rightmost point.” In [ASS90] it is shown that the subcritical contact process seen from
the rightmost point has no invariant measures. In [AEGR15] it is shown that the process
nonetheless converges in distribution.

1

The goal of this paper is to describe the conﬁguration ηt starting from η0 = Zd, for large
values of t. We describe it in terms of the macroscopic locations of infected regions in
space and the relative positions of infected sites in each such region.

In higher dimensions, the idea of “seen from a speciﬁc infected site” can be replaced by
considering the contact process modulo translations, at least when ﬁnite conﬁgurations
are being considered. We say that two non-empty ﬁnite conﬁgurations η and η′ ⊆ Zd
are equivalent if they are translations of each other. Let Λ denote the quotient space
resulting from this equivalence, and let hηi denote the projection of a ﬁnite conﬁguration
η onto Λ ∪ {∅}. The contact process modulo translations is the process (ζt)t>0 given by
ζt = hηti ∈ Λ ∪ {∅}. Since the evolution rules of (ηt)t>0 are translation-invariant, the
process (ζt)t>0 is a homogeneous Markov process. The set Λ is an irreducible class and
the absorbing state ∅ is reached almost-surely.
We say that a probability distribution µ on Λ is a quasi-stationary distribution, or simply
QSD, if, for every t > 0, L (ζ µ

t |ζ µ

t

6= ∅) = µ.

Proposition 1.1 ([SS14, AEGR15]). The subcritical contact process modulo translations
on Zd has a QSD ν on Λ (which depends on d and λ) such that the Yaglom limit

6= ∅(cid:17) → ν as t → ∞
holds for any ﬁnite non-empty initial conﬁguration A.
The absorption time τ µ = inf{t > 0 : ζ µ
t = ∅} starting from a QSD µ is exponentially
distributed (by the Markov Property). Let α denote the absorption rate of the limiting
distribution ν:

t (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ζ A
L (cid:16)ζ A

t

P(ζ ν
t

6= ∅) = e−αt.

(2)

Using Proposition 1.1 and controlling the statistical eﬀect of picking the rightmost infected
site, is is shown in [AEGR15] that for any inﬁnite initial conﬁguration A ⊆ −N, the
subcritical contact process seen from the rightmost point converges in distribution to ν.

In this paper we provide a more detailed description of the collection of infected regions,
in any dimension. Let Rt be such that

t ≪ Rt ≪ eαt/d.

At time t > 0, consider percolation on the set ηt by connecting sites at distance less than
Rt. Let Ct denote the set of connected components. Each ﬁnite component C ∈ Ct can
be identiﬁed by a pair (x, ζ), where the choice of x among the sites of C is arbitrary (e.g.
lexicographical order for simplicity) and ζ = hCi ∈ Λ describes the relative positions of
such sites.

Theorem 1.1. For the subcritical contact process on Zd, the marked point process con-
sisting of macroscopic location and relative position of infected sites converges:
(e−αt/dx, ζ) −→ Poisson(ρ dx × ν) in distribution as t → ∞,
δ

X(x,ζ)∈Ct

where dx is the Lebesgue measure, ν is given by (1) and 0 < ρ < ∞ is given by (7) below.

2

Implicit in the above statement is the fact that for t large enough there are a.s. no inﬁnite
components in Ct.
We conclude with a brief discussion of the proof.

Most of the work is devoted to extend the convergence stated in Proposition 1.1 to a
scenario where η0 = Zd instead of a ﬁxed set A, and the conditioning is on the existence
of infected sites in a box whose size grows with t (extra assumptions on Rt are a posteriori
immaterial in the proof of Theorem 1.1). Denote Br = [−r, r]d ∩ Zd.
Lemma 1.1. Let (ηt)t>0 be the subcritical contact process on Zd. Then

L (cid:16)hηt ∩ BRti(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ηt ∩ BRt 6= ∅(cid:17) T V−−−→t→∞

under the assumption td+1 ≪ Rt ≪ eαt/2d.
One of the central steps of the proof is to extend an idea introduced in [AEGR15] for the
one-dimensional case. Using Harris’ graphical construction, conditioned on the existence
of an infected point at time t, we ﬁrst locate a site x whose infection percolates from time
0 to time t, and then insulate it from certain events in order to get rid of the information
coming from the choice of x. In this process we obtain a random space-time point with
the property that the only information which remains from the conditioning is basically
the fact that it percolates up to time t. This being done successfully with high probability,
we can apply Proposition 1.1 from there.

About the constant ρ, in [SS14] it is shown that the limiting distribution ν in Proposi-
tion 1.1 is the unique QSD satisfying

We will show that

Eν|ζ| < ∞.

√t (in fact et/ log2 t suﬃces).

under the assumption t2d+1 ≪ Rt ≪ e
In [AEGR15] it is shown that ν is the unique minimal QSD (i.e. the one with highest
absorption rate) and that the sub-Markovian kernel of the evolution ζt restricted to Λ
is α-recurrent with summable left eigenmeasure ν on Λ. It follows from the theory of
α-recurrent processes that this kernel also has a positive right eigenvector h : Λ → R and
νh < ∞ (both ν and h are unique if normalized by ν · 1 = 1 and ν · h = 1). This in turn
implies that, for each A ∈ Λ, one has not only (1) but also
6= ∅(cid:17) → h(A).

The rest of the paper is divided as follows. In Section 2 we brieﬂy describe a graphical
construction, introducing notation and stating the FKG inequality, and then give a def-
inition of good points that will be used in the rest of the paper. In Section 3 we prove
Lemma 1.1 and (5). In Section 4 we prove Theorem 1.1.

2 Preliminaries and main tools

We start gathering common notation for the reader’s convenience. Then in §2.1 we will
present Harris’ graphical construction with further notation, and in §2.2 we will deﬁne
good points, which will be a central concept used in the rest of the paper.

From (2), (6) and duality, we have the useful estimates:

e−αt > P(ηx

t 6= ∅) = P(x ∈ ηZd

t ) ∼ h({0})e−αt

as t → ∞.

(8)

Letter β denotes an arbitrary number that will be enlarged throughout the proof. The
product βt means ⌊βt⌋. Some deﬁnitions such as that of good point are implicitly
parametrized by β.
For r > 0, we deﬁne the balls Br = {x ∈ Rd : kxk∞ 6 r} and Br = Br∩ Zd. We also deﬁne
the discrete sphere Dr by Br \ Br−1. The associated balls and discrete sphere centered at
y are denoted by y + Br, y + Br and y + Dr.
We denote by |A| the cardinal of a subset A of Zd. The total variation distance of
probability measures will be denoted kµ − µ′k = supA |µ(A) − µ′(A)|.
The letters c and C denote diﬀerent positive and ﬁnite numbers each time they appear.
They may depend on λ and d, but neither on t nor on Rt. When they depend on β we
write cβ and Cβ.

2.1 Graphical representation and FKG inequality

Deﬁne Ld = (Z + {±1/3})d and let U be a Poisson point process in Rd+1 with intensity
given by (cid:16)Py∈Zd δy +Py∈L λδy(cid:17) × dt. Notice that U ⊆ (Zd ∪ Ld) × R. Let (Ω,F , P)
be the underlying probability space. For nearest neighbors x, y ∈ Zd we write U x,y =
U ∩ ({x + 1/3(y − x)} × R) and U x = U ∩ ({x} × R). For t ∈ U x we say that there is a
recovery mark at site x at time t, and for t ∈ U x,y we say that there is an infection arrow
from x to y.

Given two space-time points (y, s) and (x, t), we deﬁne a path from (y, s) to (x, t) as a
ﬁnite sequence (x0, t0), . . . , (xk, tk) with x0 = x, xk = y, s = t0 6 t1 6 . . . 6 tk = t
with the following property. For each i = 1, . . . , k, the i-th segment [(xi−1, ti−1), (xi, ti)]
is either vertical, that is, xi = xi−1, or horizontal, that is, |xi − xi−1| = 1 and ti = ti−1.
Horizontal segments are also referred to as jumps. If all horizontal segments satisfy ti =
ti−1 ∈ U xi−1,xi then such path is also called a λ-path. If, in addition, all vertical segments
satisfy (ti−1, ti] ∩ U xi = ∅ we call it an open path from (y, s) to (x, t).

4

The existence of an open path from (y, s) to (x, t) is denoted by (y, s)   (x, t). Also for two
sets of the plane C, D we use {C   D} = {(y, s)   (x, t) for some (y, s) ∈ C, (x, t) ∈ D}.
We denote by Lt the set Zd × {t} ⊆ Rd+1.
For A ∈ P(Zd), we deﬁne ηA
s,t ∈ P(Zd) by
ηA
s,t = {x ∈ Zd : (A × {s})   (x, t)}

When s = 0 we omit it. We use (ηt) and (ζt) for the processes deﬁned by (9), that is (ηt)
is a contact process with parameter λ and (ζt) is this process modulo translations. Both
of them are Markov. Note that if A is ﬁnite, the same holds for ηA
for every t > 0,
almost surely. Also note that ∅ is absorbing for both processes. When A is a singleton {y}
we write ηy
We use ω for a conﬁguration of points in Rd+1 and ωδ, ωλ for its restrictions to Zd × R
and Ld × R respectively. We write ω > ω′ if ω′λ ⊆ ωλ and ωδ ⊆ ω′δ. We slightly abuse the
notation and identify a set of conﬁgurations Q with the event “U ∈ Q”.
A minor topological technicality needs to be mentioned. Consider the space of locally
ﬁnite conﬁgurations with the Skorohod topology: two conﬁgurations are close if they
have the same number of points in a large space-time box and the position of the points
are approximately the same.
In the sequel we assume that all events considered have
zero-probability boundaries under this topology. The important fact is that events of the
form {E   F} are measurable and satisfy this condition, as long as E and F are bounded
Borel subsets of Zd × R.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A set of conﬁgurations Q is increasing if ω > ω′ ∈ Q implies ω ∈ Q.
Theorem (FKG Inequality). If Q1 and Q2 are increasing, then P(Q1∩Q2) > P(Q1)P(Q2).
See [BG91, §§2.1-2.2] for proofs and precise deﬁnitions.

2.2 Good point

We say that the space-time point (z, s) is a good point if every λ-path starting from (z, s)
makes less than βt jumps during [s, s + t] and we denote by Gs
z the corresponding event.
The deﬁnition of good point depends on β and t but we omit them in the notation Gs
z.
We deﬁne

Gs(A) = “Gs

z the event of good border.

and we call eGs
Lemma 2.1. For every ρ < ∞, for β and t large enough depending on ρ,

z = Gs(z + D2βt)

Corollary 2.1. For all ρ < ∞, if β and t are large enough, then for every set A with

|A| 6 eρt we have P(cid:16)G0(A)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ηt ∩ BRt 6= ∅(cid:17) > 1 − e−ρt.

Proof. Let ρ < ∞ ﬁxed. For t and β large enough, we have P (G0(A)) > 1− e−(ρ+α)t with
a similar proof than the previous one. Using also (8) we get

P(cid:16)G0(A)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ηt ∩ BRt 6= ∅(cid:17) > 1 −

1 − P(G0(A))

e−(ρ+α)t
e−αt = 1 − e−ρt.

The fact that good points have so high probability creates independence between points
descendants and make possible to obtain the following lower bounds.

Corollary 2.2. If Rt ≪ eαt/d then, for β and t large enough, we have

P (ηt ∩ BRt 6= ∅) > cβRd

t t−de−αt.

Proof. Let A = {2βty : y ∈ B(Rt−3βt)/2βt}. Conditioning on G0(A), that is, the event
where all points in A are good, survivals of points in A are independent (because two
points in A are at distance at least 2βt). Since P(G0(A)) → 1 at t → ∞, we get

t ∩ BRt 6= ∅(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) G0(A)(cid:17)
P (ηt ∩ BRt 6= ∅) & P(cid:16)ηA

because e−ρt ≪ e−αt and |A|e−αt ≪ 1. We conclude using |A| ∼ (Rt/βt)d.

In this section we prove Lemma 1.1. The requirement Rt ≪ eαt/2d could be replaced by
Rt ≪ e

3.1 Construction of the work path

Let 4 denote a well-order of Zd, and read w ≺ z as w has higher priority or precedes z.
In the following we take and A ⊆ Zd a non-empty initial conﬁguration. Let D ∈ Zd × R+;
we want to deﬁne a “minimal” path ΓA→D from A × {0} to D.
If ηA ∩ D 6= ∅, deﬁne

X A→D = min{x ∈ A, (x, 0)   D} ∈ Zd

as the highest-priority site whose infection survives up to the space-time region D. We
want to deﬁne a “minimal path” in a convenient way, which is slightly more delicate than
in the one dimensional case [AEGR15].
The path ΓA→D will be described by a ﬁnite sequence {(x0, t0), . . . , (xn, tn)}. Take x0 =
X A→D and t0 = 0. Notice that (x0, t0)   D. Suppose (xk, tk) has been deﬁned, and
satisﬁes (xk, t+
k )   D. Take τk+1 > tk as the instant of the next infection mark from
xk. If {x} × [tk, τk+1] intersects D we take n = k + 1, tk+1 = t, xk+1 = xk, and stop the
construction.

Otherwise, in order to continue the construction, we let tk+1 = τk+1, take yk as the
destination of the outgoing arrow from xk at time tk+1 and choose xk+1 as follows.
Since (xk, tk+1)   D, either (yk, tk+1)   D or (xk, t+
k+1)   D must occur.
If both
occur, we choose the one with higher priority for xk+1. If only one occurs, we choose the
corresponding site. More precisely, we have four cases (illustrated in Figure 1):

(a) if yk ≺ xk and (yk, tk+1)   D, then xk+1 = yk,
(b) if yk ≺ xk but (yk, tk+1) 6  D then xk+1 = xk,
(c) if xk ≺ yk and (xk, t+
k+1)   D, then xk+1 = xk,
(d) if xk ≺ yk but (xk, t+
k+1) 6  D, then xk+1 = yk.
We ﬁnally extend the path to [0, t]: for s ∈ [tk, tk+1), ΓA→D(s) = xk.
In the following, if ηt ∩ BRt 6= ∅, we will denote by Γ = ΓL0→BRt×{t}. For y ∈ ηs, we let
Γy,s = ΓL0→(y,s). We also write X and Xy,s the starting points of these paths.

3.2 Break point and consequences

Deﬁnition 3.1 (Break point). We say that the space-time point (y, s) is a break point if
for every w ∈ y + B2βt \ {y}, L0 6  (w, s).

7

If ηt ∩ BRt 6= ∅, then Γ is well deﬁned. In this case, let

S = inf{s > 0 : (Γ(s), s) is a break point}

be the time of the ﬁrst break point on Γ and let Y = Γ(S) be its spatial location. This
notion of break point makes it possible to control the evolution of the process through
the following lemmas.
Lemma 3.1. For all s ∈ [0, t] and y ∈ Zd,

from Lemma 3.1. Finally, we use Corollary 2.1 again and Proposition 1.1.

H1 means that (y, s) is reached, H2 means that (y, s) is a break point, H3 means that it
is the ﬁrst one.

We now need to describe necessary and suﬃcient conditions so that (y, s) is on Γ, that is,
so that Γy,s and Γ coincide on [0, s]. To that end, we ﬁnd a set of space-time points that
must not percolate in order to ensure that (y, s) is on Γ (the red and green squares at
time s in Figure 2). Denote by {(x1, t1), . . . , (xn, tn)} and {y1, . . . , yn} the points of the
construction procedure of Γy,s, as described earlier in this section. Let

y,s = {(xk, tk+1) such that xk ≺ yk but (xk, t+

Figure 2: The event {Y = y, S = s, bGs
y}. This event splits in three parts. The ﬁrst one
depends on what happens before time s. It consists of the occurrence of H1, H2, H3. The
set A′′ is represented by green and red squared points whereas the set A′\A′′ is represented
by blue and red bullets. H1 occurs by the ﬁrst part of fuchsia path, H2 consists of the
non existence of the dashed black paths. Moreover s is the ﬁrst time with this property:
H3 consists of the existence of open paths from L0 to (Γy,s(u) + B2βt) \ Γy,s(u) for all
u < s. The rest depends on what happens between time s and time t. The second part
depends on Ee
y,s. It consists of the occurrence of H4 that is the non existence of the green
or red dashed paths from A′′ (squared points at time s) to BRt, and of the occurrence of
eGs
y: the dotted λ-paths starting from (y + D2βt) × {s} can not reach distance βt by time
s + t. The third part depends on the gray region Ei
y,s and consists of both occurrences of
{(y, s)   Lt} (second part of fuchsia path) and Gs
y that is the dotted paths starting in
(y, s) can not reach βt by time t.

y,s and A2

The sets A1
y,s are given by the green arrows in the Figure 1, corresponding to
cases d and b respectively. They correspond to smaller space-time points met during the
construction Γy,s that had higher priority but were not chosen because they wouldn’t
connect to (y, s). The set A3
y,s corresponds to the oﬀspring of these points at time s.
Finally, let

A′′ = A3

y,s ∪ {(z, s) : ∃x ≺ Xy,s such that (x, 0)   (z, s)}

and let H4 be the event that A′′ 6  BRt × {t}.
We then have the following equivalence:

So, we have

3.4 Existence and location of break points

We now move to proving Lemmas 3.3 and 3.4.

Deﬁnition 3.2 (Favorable time intervals). Let γ be a path in the time interval [0, t] and

let β > 0. We say that a time interval [s − √t, s) ⊆ [0, t] is favorable for path γ if for any
u ∈ [s − √t, s) the number of jumps of γ during [u, s) is at most 4β|s − u|.

Lemma 3.5. Let γ be a path in the time interval [0, t] with at most βt jumps. Then there
are at least

√t
4 − 1 disjoint favorable intervals for γ contained in [0, t
2].

This fact is intuitively obvious. For a proof, see [AEGR15, Lemma 2.12].

Lemma 3.6. If a path γ in the time interval [0, t] has at least k disjoint favorable intervals
in [0, t

2], then for all t > 1

with pβ < 1 for all β.

Proof. This proof has a big overlap with [AEGR15, Lemma 2.15]. The main diﬀerence is
in the following step. Let Dγ be the closed set given by the union of the horizontal and
vertical segments of γ and Dc

γ = (Rd × [0, t]) \ Dγ. Then {Γ = γ} can be written as
{Γ = γ} = {γ is open} ∩ H c
γ,
where H c
γ and is a decreasing event. Whereas in d = 1 it was enough
to take Γ as the rightmost path, in the general case this property relies on the deﬁnition
of Γ in a more subtle way.
To deﬁne H c
γ we use the fact that {Γ 6= γ} when some “better” vertices (regarding to
the deﬁnition of Γ) exist and are not used by γ. We construct {(x1, t1), . . . , (xn, tn)} a
representation of γ analogous to the one in the construction of the minimal path. To do

γ depends only on Dc

12

that, we consider the deﬁnition of the path γ in the graphical representation, we erase
the points (xi, ti) such that ti = ti+1 and we add the points (yi, si) corresponding to an
outgoing arrow not used (more precisely, if (xi, ti) is still a point of the path, we add the
points (xi, si) such that si = U yi,· and si ∈ (ti, ti+1)). With this new representation of γ
we deﬁne the following set:

A(γ) = {(xk, tk+1) such that xk < xk+1} ∪ {(xk, tk+1) such that xk > xk+1}

Thus

Hγ =n∃x <d X : (x, 0)   Lt in Dc

Ft =n(x,−u),kxk∞ 6 ⌊4βu⌋ and 0 6 u < √t} or u = −√t and kxk∞ > 4β√to .

Then,

Thus,

2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) Γ = γ(cid:19) > P(cid:16)∃ s ∈ [0, t

Let √t 6 t1 < t2 < · · · < tk 6 t

2 be such that tj > tj−1 + √t and [tj − √t, tj) is a

favorable interval for γ. Write zj = (tj, γ(tj)). By deﬁnition of favorable interval and of
the set Ft, the path γ can not make enough jumps to cross (or overtake) Ft so we have
Dγ ⊆ zj + Ft. If Jzj (= Jγ,tj ,γ(tj )) occurs then zj + Ft   zj + Et. Since these events
depend on U ∩(cid:16)Rd × (tj − √t, tj](cid:17), which are disjoint as j goes from 1 to k, we have that

That pβ < 1 is a consequence of exponential decay [AEGR15, Lemma 2.13].

Proof of Lemma 3.4. We start with A = Zd. With high probability, we can suppose that
boundaries of some boxes are good and that only the points in BRt−3βt survive (because
there are much more points in BRt−3βt than in BRt−βt \ BRt−3βt), so we can pretend that
{Y ∈ BRt−βt} depends only on BRt−3βt × [0, t]. We have

P(cid:16)Y ∈ BRt−βt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ηt ∩ BRt 6= ∅(cid:17)

Proof of (4). We discuss how results of Sturm and Swart ([Swa09] and [SS14]), translated
to our setting, say that ν is the unique QSD satisfying Eν|ζ| < ∞. Recall that Λ is the
quotient space resulting from the equivalence translation and (ζt) is the contact process
modulo translation taking values in Λ ∪ {∅}.
Let Z = {A ⊆ Zd : A is non empty and ﬁnite}.
Pt acting on (typically inﬁnite) measures µ on Z by

[Swa09] and [SS14] consider the kernel

(µPt)(D) = XA∈Z

µ(A) P(ηA

t ∈ D), D ⊆ Z.

It is shown in [Swa09, Proposition 1.4] that there exists a translation invariant eigenmea-
sure µ with eigenvalue r, that is:

1. for all x ∈ Zd and A ∈ P(Zd), µ(A + x) = µ(A),
2. The measure µ is non zero and locally ﬁnite which implies (by Lemma 3.1 of [Swa09])
R µ(dA)10∈A < ∞,

3. for all t > 0, µPt = ertµ.

P(ηi

This measure appears as limit of a subsequence of the (properly renormalized) Laplace
transforms of measures µt =Pi
t ∈ ·), locally ﬁnite, homogeneous. Then, Sturm and
Swart [SS14] work with ˜µ the associated probability measure in the modulo shift space.
The measure ˜µ is a probability measure on Λ deﬁned by, for [A] ∈ Λ, ˜µ([A]) = cµ(A)
where [A] is the class of A in Λ. By above property 1, ˜µ is well deﬁned. By property
3, the measure ˜µ satisﬁes ˜µPt = e−αt ˜µ, then it is a quasi-stationary distribution for the
contact process modulo shifts.

Moreover, Sturm and Swart show that (theorem 2.12 in [SS14]) ˜µ satisﬁes the Yaglom
limit. So, ˜µ = ν. Moreover,

The next step is to approximate the process ηt for a ﬁxed time t by by independent patches
within mesoscopic boxes.
Let Ψ be a bounded box Rd. Let Rt = e− αt
d Zd be a microscopic lattice (gray lattice in
Figure 4) where the conﬁguration ηt = e− αt
d ηt ⊆ Rt lives (pink points in Figure 4). We
divide the space in boxes of microscopic radius Rt. Namely we consider the mesoscopic

The terms (14) and (15) vanish for β large enough by Lemma 2.1. The term (13) is
bounded by nte−αt · CβtRd−1
, which vanishes since Rt ≫ t. In the ﬁrst inequality we
excluded some sites from the initial conﬁguration and used 8. The ﬁrst equality uses the
fact that, conditioning on the event of all good borders, the processes in each box are
independent and stay within the respective box.

We are now able to prove the scaling theorem.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let

Mt = X(x,ζ)∈Ct

δ(e− α

tx,ζ)

where (x, ζ) are characteristics of connected components explained in the introduction.

Let M be a Poisson random (marked) measure on (cid:16)Rd × Λ,B ⊗ Λ(cid:17) with mean ρdx × ν.

We work again with the microscopic and mesoscopic lattices previously introduced. De-
note by M′t the point process associated to the centers of the boxes containing infected
points (the pink-hatched boxes in the Figure 4).

We can write M′t =P∞i=1 δX(i)
Let Ψ be a bounded rectangle of Rd. Write pt = P(ηt ∩ B(i)
have infected points in a box B(i)

.

pt nt(Ψ) ∼ pt eαtR−d

|Ψ| → ρ|Ψ|.

Now let us show that Mt converges in distribution to M. Let Ξ ⊆ Ψ be a compact
rectangle and let D ⊆ Λ be a ﬁnite set of conﬁgurations.

As we have seen it before, pt × nt(Ξ) converges to ρ|Ξ| (so (3d − 1)ptpt × nt(Ξ) converges
to 0). By Lemma 1.1 we know that P(cid:16)hηt ∩ B(j)
Rt 6= ∅(cid:17) converges to ν(D).
So

Rt i ∈ D(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ηt ∩ B(j)

P (Mt(Ξ × D) = 0) −−−→t→∞

e−ρ|Ξ|ν(D) = P(M(Ξ × D) = 0).

In the same way, one can prove that E(Mt(Ξ × D)) converges to E(M(Ξ × D)). Thus,
using a result of Kallenberg [Kal83] (see Proposition 3.22 in [Res08]) we can conclude that
Mt converges in distribution to M as t goes to ∞.
