ABSTRACT

Aims. Previous observations of the young massive star formation region IRAS 19410+2336 have revealed strong outﬂow activity
with several interacting outﬂows. We aim to get a better understanding of the outﬂow activity in this region by observing the SiO and
H13CO+ emission with high angular resolution. SiO is known to trace shocked gas, which is often associated with young energetic
outﬂows. With the H13CO+ data, we intend to better understand the distribution of the quiescent gaseous component of the region.
Methods. The SiO observations in the J=2-1 v=0 transition and H13CO+ J=1-0 observations were performed by the Plateau de
Bure Interferometer, combined with IRAM 30 m single-dish observations, in order to get the missing short-spacing information. We
complement this new high-resolution observation with earlier CO and H2 data.
Results. The SiO observations do not trace the previously in CO and H2 identiﬁed outﬂows well. Although we identify regions of
highly increased SiO abundance indicative of shock interaction, there are hardly any bipolar structures in the data. The southern part
of the region, which exhibits strong H2 emission, shows almost no SiO. The CO and SiO data show only weak similarities, and the
main SiO emission lies between the two dominating dust clumps of the region.
Conclusions. Most SiO emission is likely to be a result of high-velocity shocks due to protostellar jets. However, this does not explain
all the emission features and additional eﬀects; for example, colliding gas ﬂows at the interface of the two main regions may play
an important role in the origin of the emission. The present SiO data show that several diﬀerent eﬀects can inﬂuence SiO emission,
which makes the interpretation of SiO data more diﬃcult than often assumed.

1. Introduction

The formation of massive stars is the subject of strong debate,
and there are several theoretical approaches that are able to ex-
plain it. One of the main theories is the Core Accretion Model.
It assumes that the processes in high-mass star formation are
similar to the processes in low-mass star formation. The main
diﬀerence for high-mass stars is given by massive turbulent
cores, which lead to higher accretion rates on the protostars and
massive disks around them (see Krumholz 2006; McKee & Tan
2003). Another approach is the so-called Competitive Accretion
Model, which is based on the observation that massive stars form
in dense clusters. In this scenario, the cloud fragments into many
low-mass cores, which form protostars. Since these cores are
close together in the dense center of the cloud, they act together
and produce a large scale gravitational potential. This leads to
the accretion of material from a larger area than would be possi-
ble for a single protostar. In the following, the cores in the dense
center compete to accrete mass from this area (see Bonnell et al.
2007; Bonnell 2008; Zinnecker & Yorke 2007). Both models ex-

pect disks and jets around the protostars, but in diﬀerent forms,
because the clustered formation of protostars in the competitive
accretion would most likely lead to less collimated outﬂows. The
core accretion model, on the other hand, is a scaled-up version
of low-mass star formation and therefore expects massive colli-
mated outﬂows, similar to the ones found in low-mass star for-
mation (Tan et al. 2014).

Since direct observations of the innermost regions around the
central disks and cores are very diﬃcult, a study of the jets and
outﬂows is helpful for understanding what is happening during
the formation of the stars. A tracer that is often used to detect
the jets and outﬂows is SiO, because the depletion of Si in qui-
escent gas is high and most of the Si can be found in silicates,
bound to dust grains, so the Si abundance in quiet regions is
low. However, dynamical processes, such as shocks, are able to
release the silicon from the dust grains. The silicon can be di-
rectly present as SiO on the dust grains or is transformed by
successive gas-phase chemistry from Si into SiO (Schilke et al.
1997; Gusdorf et al. 2008a,b, see Section 4 for further discus-
sion). One therefore assumes that SiO shows the shocks due to
jets or outﬂows directly and is less inﬂuenced by environmen-
tal gas, such as more common molecules like CO (see, e.g.,
Codella et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2007). This was proven by several
SiO observations toward massive star formation regions, where

the protostellar jets were revealed by the SiO emission (e.g.,
Cesaroni et al. 1999; Beuther et al. 2002c; Leurini et al. 2013;
Codella et al. 2013).

However, there are also studies in which the origin of the SiO
emission is more ambiguous, since it does not show a clear jet or
outﬂow structure. An example is the observation of the massive
star formation region W43 by Nguyen-Lu’o’ng et al. (2013).
The observation revealed large scale SiO emission, which is
probably not a result of jets due to star formation but of low-
velocity shocks due to colliding ﬂows. Another example is
the young outﬂow region L1448-mm, which has revealed nar-
row (∆v ≈ 0.5 km s−1) SiO lines at ambient velocities, which
could in turn be emission from decelerated postshock material
(Gusdorf et al. 2008a) or produced by magnetic shock precur-
sors (Jiménez-Serra et al. 2004). In addition, there are still dis-
cussions of the time evolution of the SiO emission. In this con-
text, Jiménez-Serra et al. (2009, 2011) investigated the time evo-
lution of the shock propagation and López-Sepulcre et al. (2011)
and Leurini et al. (2014) the time dependence in jet activity.
They came to the conclusion that the SiO emission due to mas-
sive jet-driven outﬂows can strongly change on comparably short
timescales.

The present work is based on observations of the region
IRAS 19410+2336, which is a young massive star formation
region in an early evolutionary state. It has been studied a
lot, and the main characteristics of the region are well known.
The distance to the region is 2.16 kpc (Xu et al. 2009), and
it has a rest velocity of 22.4 km s−1 (Sridharan et al. 2002)
and an integrated bolometric luminosity of around 104 L⊙
(Martín-Hernández et al. 2008a). The total gas mass of this re-
gion is calculated by Beuther et al. (2002c) and Beuther et al.
(2005) to be 510 M⊙. The mean temperature was investigated
by Rodón et al. (2012) with several known gas temperature trac-
ers, such as H2CO and CH3CN, with the result of an aver-
age temperature of 40 ± 15 K and a temperature of 80 ±
40 K for the dense cores. Early observations of the contin-
uum of IRAS 19410+2336 were conducted by Beuther et al.
(2002c) and Beuther & Schilke (2004). Of special interest con-
cerning the formation of massive stars is the outﬂow study from
Beuther et al. (2003). They observed the 2.6 mm continuum and
the CO (1-0) line, using the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferom-
eter and the IRAM 30 m telescope. Their study also included
observations of the H2 line at 2.12 µm, using the Calar Alto 3.5
m telescope. They found an intense outﬂow activity with strong
evidence of possibly nine, but at least seven bipolar outﬂows.
The proposed outﬂows are shown in Figure 1.

However, their study was based on observations of the CO
(1-0) line. CO emission with a high velocity shift can be used
to trace outﬂows and shocks. But CO is very common in the
interstellar medium, and the CO (1-0) transition is already ex-
cited at low temperature. Therefore the emission is strongly in-
ﬂuenced by environmental gas and this line is not considered to
be an ideal outﬂow tracer. The aim of the new observation was
to get a better understanding of the outﬂow activity, using SiO as
a well-known shock tracer, which should be less inﬂuenced by
the environmental gas and therefore show the jets and outﬂows
better.

2. Observations

The observations were done in several steps. The interferomet-
ric data were taken with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer in
France (PdBI, see Guilloteau et al. 1992) and were merged with
the single-dish data from the IRAM 30 m telescope at Pico

Fig. 1. Proposed outﬂows by Beuther et al. (2003) shown by ellipses
and arrows. The proposal of the outﬂows is based on the line wing
data of CO (1-0), as shown in the ﬁgure in blue and red contours.
The blue contours show the line emission from CO, integrated from
2 to 18 km s−1, and the red ones show the emission integrated from
26 to 47 km s−1. The contour levels are in both cases from 2 to 20 Jy
beam−1· km s−1 in steps of 3 Jy beam−1· km s−1, in short 2(3)20 Jy
beam−1· km s−1. The background shows the 1.2 mm continuum data
from Beuther et al. (2002c) in gray scale with dotted contours (the con-
tour levels are 100(100)700 mJy beam−1). The green dotted circles show

Veleta, Spain. The CO and H2 data were already available as
calibrated datasets by Beuther et al. (2003), as well as a 1.2 mm
continuum map by Beuther et al. (2002c).

The region was observed with the PdBI in May 2003 in the
D Array with ﬁve antennas, and in December 2003 in the C Ar-
ray with six antennas. The baselines ranged from 24 m to 82 m
in the D-Array, and from 48 m to 229 m in the C Array. It was
observed simultaneously at 3 mm with receiver 1 and at 1 mm
with receiver 2. Bad weather conditions meant that the quality
of the 1 mm observation is poor so the data were not used in
the following analysis. Receiver 1 was tuned to 86.847 GHz to-
ward the SiO (2-1) line. Simultaneously, the H13CO+(1-0) line
at 86.754 GHz was observed with another correlator unit. In ad-
dition, two 320 MHz correlators were used to get a continuum
measurement with a large bandwidth. The primary beam of the
array at 3 mm is 59” making it impossible to observe the whole
region at once. As shown in Fig. 1, a mosaic of eight ﬁelds was
observed to cover the whole area.

To remove temporal ﬂuctuations of the amplitude and the
phase, the quasars 1923+210 and 2023+336 were used. To get
the total value of the amplitude, the two quasars MWC349 and
3C454 were observed and another quasar, 0420-014, was ob-
served for the bandpass calibration. The frequency resolution of

F. Widmann et al.: SiO: Not the perfect outﬂow tracer

(RN)

the used correlators is 40 kHz, which means a velocity resolution
of 0.14 km s−1. For further analysis, the data were smoothed into
velocity channels of 1 km s−1.

The observations with the IRAM 30m telescope were car-
ried out in August 2003 in the on-the-ﬂy mode. The SiO (2-1)
and the H13CO+ (1-0) lines were observed simultaneously with
a frequency resolution of 40 kHz. This is equivalent to a ve-
locity resolution of 0.28 km s−1. Also, the single-dish data are
smoothed to 1 km s−1.

The two data sets were merged, using the GILDAS1 soft-
ware. The ﬁnal resolution of the 3 mm continuum is 4.28 x 2.68
arcseconds at a position angle of 32 degree and for the lines 4.80
x 3.06 arcseconds at a position angle of 31 degrees. The rms of
the ﬁnal data is 4.8 x 10−4 Jy beam−1 for the continuum and 1.7
x 10−2 Jy beam−1 for the line data.

3. Observational results

The main goal of the observation was to gain information about
the outﬂow activity in the region. Therefore, the line wings of
the SiO emission are important to study. The line wings are the
part of the emission which is a result of moving material along
the line of sight, for example due to outﬂows. As indication for
the line width of the ambient gaseous component, we used the
width of H13CO+ line, averaged over the whole area, which is
on average 6 km s−1 for the full width at zero power (FWZP)
and 2.7 km s−1 for the full width half maximum (FWHM). This
means that the emission of the line wings starts approximately at
the rest velocity of 22.4 km s−1 ± 3 km s−1. With this information
and the visual inspection of the SiO emission, we came to the
conclusion that the emission between 6 and 19 km s−1 best shows
the blueshifted wing and the emission between 25 and 38 km s−1
the redshifted one.

Figure 2 (central panel) presents the 3 mm continuum, as
well as the line-wing emission of the SiO emission. The contin-
uum structure ﬁts older observations shown in Fig. 1 well (see
also Beuther et al. 2002c; Beuther & Schilke 2004; Rodón et al.
2012). The interferometric observation ﬁlters out large scale
structure, but the comparison to older interferometric observa-
tion at 2.6mm by Beuther et al. (2003) shows very good agree-
ment. Also, the existence of the strong SiO emission is a clear
hint of ongoing shock activity. But there are unexpected results.
The majority of the protostars are expected to form in the dens-
est areas of the region, which are shown by the strongest con-
tinuum emission. These are also the areas where Beuther et al.
(2003) found most of the high-velocity CO emission. Therefore,
one would expect most shock and jet activity, and consequently
most SiO emission in the same areas or the close environment
of the main continuum emission and high velocity CO emission.
However, most of the SiO emission occurs between the two large
scale continuum sources and in the northern part of the observed
region, whereas only weak emission appears around the south-
ern continuum sources. Another observation from Fig. 2 is that
there are no clear bipolar structures.

3.1. Emissionlines

To get a better understanding of the data, it is helpful to look at
the spectra at diﬀerent points, which are shown in Fig. 2. These
are the points of the strongest blue- (Points 1 and 2) and red-
shifted (Points 3 and 4) SiO emission and also the centers of the

1 http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS

two massive gas clumps (Point 5 and 6). In each spectrum, a ﬁt-
ted Gaussian shows the key characteristics of the emission line.
As we expect a lot of emission due to shocks, it is unlikely that
a Gaussian ﬁts the emission very well. However, we can use it
to derive some characteristics of the emission line, such as the
peak velocity and an approximation of the FWHM. For more in-
formation on the Gaussians, see Table B.1 in the appendix. The
FWHM of the H13CO+ lines are between 1.8 km s−1 and 3.5 km
s−1. This conﬁrms that H13CO+ only traces the dense gas with-
out any signiﬁcant linewings and does not show shock activity
(e.g., Vasyunina et al. 2011). The thermal line width at 40 K of
the H13CO+ line is smaller than the observed one (∆v ≈ 0.22
km s−1) because the line is broadened due to turbulent motion
in the cloud. Beuther & Sridharan (2007) measured line widths
between 1.8 and 4.4 km s−1 for the H13CO+ line for massive
infrared dark clouds, which ﬁts our observations.

In comparison to the H13CO+ lines, the lines from SiO are
much broader. Interestingly, this broader emission is often ﬁt rel-
atively well by Gaussian proﬁles, but we also identify clear line
wing emission in several positions (especially Points 2 & 3). We
derived Gaussian FWHM values between 4.5 km s−1 and 11.3
km s−1, as shown in Table B.1. The line widths therefore lie in a
range that is also observed by other studies, since the SiO lines
often have widths of 5 km s−1 to 20 km s−1 (e.g., Gusdorf et al.
2008a; Motte et al. 2007). In the spectra averaged over the whole
area, we derived a FWZP of approximately 18 km −1. This also
lies in the expected range, but is a rather low value for a mas-
sive star formation region. The typical value for the FWZP lies
between 10 km up to 90 km (e.g., Nguyen-Lu’o’ng et al. 2013).
The line widths therefore support the statement that SiO
traces dynamical gas in jets and outﬂows. Additionally, most of
the lines in the spectra peak below or above the rest velocity and
are represented by a Gaussian, but with an additional signal in
the line wings, which again indicates there are jets or outﬂows.
The spectra at Points 4 and 6 are remarkable because their line
peaks are approximately at rest velocity. The spectrum at Point
6 is an exception in a way, since it is extracted at the densest
part of the cloud, and the signal is within the six sigma range,
which is relatively weak, while the emission at Point 4 is over
ten sigma strong. This SiO peak clearly lies outside of the dust
emission and is the only one of the strong emission peaks that
is not signiﬁcantly red- or blueshifted, but it lies exactly at rest
velocity. Furthermore, this emission line has a width of 6.9 km
s−1, one of the narrowest of the extracted spectra.

3.2. Comparisonwitholderdata

Now we analyze the new data with respect to already existing ob-
servations from other outﬂow and shock tracers such as CO and
H2 (Beuther et al. 2003). CO traces the environmental gas, and
therefore the high-velocity emission shows the entrained outﬂow
gas (Arce et al. 2007). Both SiO and the high velocity compo-
nent of CO are well known outﬂow tracers; however, the SiO
emission should show the jets and outﬂows clearer than CO. In
Fig. 3, the lefthand image shows the blueshifted wing of the SiO
and CO emission line, whereas the middle image shows the red-
shifted wing.

At ﬁrst sight, the two molecules seem to have a very dif-
ferent distribution. Actually, there are some SiO structures that
correlate with the CO (e.g., around Point 4 and the long struc-
ture under Point 3, which is visible in the blueshifted wing), but
they are quite rare. Since the CO traces not only the gas from
the outﬂows but also the environmental gas, the structures in the
SiO emission are expected to be smaller and less wide. This is

integrated from 6 km s−1 to 19 km s−1 (levels 0.2(0.2)2 Jy beam−1· km s−1). The red contours show the redshifted wing, integrated from 25 km
s−1 to 38 km s−1 (levels 0.2(0.2)2 Jy beam−1· km s−1). In the background, the 3 mm continuum data in gray and dotted contours (levels 1.5(1.5)10
Jy beam−1) are shown. Left and right sides: Spectra at diﬀerent points. For each point, the upper spectrum is from SiO and the lower one from
H13CO+, each in the units of Jy beam−1. The red dotted line shows the rest velocity of 22.4 km s−1 and the blue number at the upper right of each

clearly observable in our data. The large bipolar structures that
are clearly present in the CO data, in particular, are largely miss-
ing in the SiO emission. Again, it is remarkable that the southern
part lacks SiO emission, although there is plenty of high-velocity
CO emission. One can also see that there are some structures that
are clearly traced in SiO, but have no counterpart in CO.
Because we found a lot of SiO signal at ambient velocity, the
righthand image of Fig. 3 shows a map of the SiO emission be-
tween 19 and 25 km s−1. This map is combined with the H2 data
at 2.12 µm and the proposed outﬂows by Beuther et al. (2003).
The H2 emission traces shock activity and can deliver some in-
formation about the diﬀerent kinds of shocks, which is discussed
below. One can see that there is plenty of H2 activity in the re-
gion. The two strongest H2 peaks in the northern part seem to be
directly correlated with SiO emission. Also, the SiO emission at
ambient velocity shows some agreement with the proposed out-
ﬂows in the northern part; for example, the outﬂows J and H can
be identiﬁed with SiO emission, as well as the southern part of
outﬂow F. However, since the SiO emission in the south is very
weak, there is no accordance with the four proposed outﬂows
in this area. Furthermore, most of the H2 emission is located in
the southern part, where several strong H2 features with jet-like
morphological structures are visible, which are also associated
with the proposed outﬂows. It is surprising that especially these
H2 structures, which are indicative of strong shocks, have no SiO
counterparts.

3.3. SiOabundance

For a better understanding of the SiO distribution, Fig. 4 shows
the N(SiO)/N(H2) abundance of the region. For the calculations,
see Appendix A. The abundance map supports the previous ﬁnd-
ings: The observed SiO peaks are visible, and one can see that
the SiO column density in the southern part is comparably low.
We saw earlier that the highest SiO emission appears in the area
between the two strong large scale continuum sources. This is
the same for the SiO abundance, since we got the highest abun-
dances in the middle of the region, where the H2 column density
is lower.
In diﬀerent studies, it has been derived and observed that cold
and quiescent gas has a SiO abundance on the order of 10
x 10−12 (e.g., Leﬂoch et al. 1998; Requena-Torres et al. 2007;
Gerner et al. 2014). Taking this into consideration, as well as the
values in the abundance map (with a maximum of 6.8 x 10−9,
for the values see Table B.2), it is clear that all the structures
in Fig. 4 show a highly increased abundance, which again im-
plies shock activity. The derived abundance also lies in the range
that is proposed by the simulations of Schilke et al. (1997) and
Gusdorf et al. (2008a,b). It is necessary to mention here that the
abundance map should be viewed with some caution. To derive
the H2 column density, we calculated the H13CO+ column den-
sity from the data and used a N(H13CO+)/N(H2) abundance, de-
rived by Gerner et al. (2014), in order to calculate the H2 column
density (for more details see Appendix A). Therefore, there are

uncertainties due to the diﬀerent excitation properties of H13CO+
and SiO and due to potential diﬀerences in the H13CO+ and
H2 column densities. Nevertheless, the map shows where SiO
is present and provides an indication of the abundance of SiO.

4. Discussion

To analyze the results of the observation, it is necessary to have a
look at the physical background of SiO emission. As mentioned
before, Si in quiescent gas is most common in silicates bound to
dust grains. We observed a highly increased abundance of SiO,
which shows that there are processes that release the Si from the
dust grains into the gas phase. This is an eﬀect of grain sputtering
or vaporization in shock waves, which occur for example in pro-
tostellar outﬂows. Simulations concerning the emission of SiO in
interstellar shocks were ﬁrst conducted by Schilke et al. (1997)
and extended in more recent studies by Gusdorf et al. (2008a,b).
For the release of Si by shocks, the composition of the origi-
nal dust grains plays an important role. When the Si is mostly
found in the core of the grains, a shock speed higher than 25 km
s−1 is needed to release the Si. In this case, the Si is released
by sputtering with heavy neutral species such as CO, and there
is an additional chemical delay because of the conversion from
Si to SiO (Gusdorf et al. 2008a). However, if SiO is present in
the grain mantles, as discussed by Gusdorf et al. (2008b), it can
be sputtered by light and abundant species (H2, He, H), and a

lower shock speed is required to release the SiO from the grains.
Gusdorf et al. (2008a,b) also came to the conclusion that the
emission lines in the second case are broader than in the case
with Si solely in the grain cores. In addition, the SiO intensity in-
creases with SiO in the grain mantle. Anderl et al. (2013) deep-
ened the studies by also considering the vaporization in grain-
grain processing as a further possibility to release Si. All three
studies came to the result that high SiO intensity can only be
achieved by SiO in the grain mantles. Broad emission lines, as
we observed them, are most likely an eﬀect of SiO in the man-
tles or several unresolved shock fronts instead of a single planar
shock wave.

In addition to the processes that release SiO into the gas
phase, it is also important to discuss the properties of the respon-
sible shock. Shocks are divided into three types: jump shocks (J-
Type, Hollenbach & McKee 1979), continuous shocks (C-Type,
Draine 1980), and a mixture of both, which is a C-type shock
with an introduced discontinuity (CJ-Type, Chieze et al. 1998).
The type of shock depends mainly on the presence of a magnetic
ﬁeld, since a magnetic ﬁeld is necessary for the shock condition
to become continuous, the ionization of the preshock gas, since
only charged particles couple to the magnetic ﬁeld, and on the
velocity of the shock, since J-type shocks can have higher ve-
locities than C-type shocks (Flower & Pineau des Forêts 2003;
Tielens 2005; Anderl et al. 2013). A main diﬀerence between the
types is that J shocks lead to partial or complete dissociation of

creased abundance is usually assumed to identify high-velocity
shocks produced by protostellar jets. Additionally, we observed,
in comparison to the ambient gas traced by H13CO+, broadened
SiO emission lines, which are a further hint of gas movement
due to jets and outﬂows. Especially in the northern part of the re-
gion, we found some agreement between the proposed outﬂows
and the SiO emission at ambient velocity. This shows that the
observed outﬂows lie in the sky plane, at least partially, which
can also explain the narrow emission lines, in comparison with
other high mass star-forming regions. Especially the strong SiO
peaks in the northern region seem to be closely correlated with
H2 peaks. This strengthens the idea of C-type shocks as the ori-
gin of the SiO emission.

However, there are also some observations that are harder to
explain. The general point is that the SiO emission is very diﬀer-
ent to the high velocity CO emission. The initial idea behind the
observation was to get the comparison of the high-velocity CO
and the SiO data. We expected to see the the jets and outﬂows in
both molecules; however, the SiO is less inﬂuenced by environ-
mental gas. Therefore, it should trace gas closer to the jets and
outﬂows and deliver more detailed information about them (see,
e.g., Gueth & Guilloteau 1999; Palau et al. 2006). But the out-
ﬂow features, which are clearly present in the CO data, are only
represented by the SiO data in the northern part of the region. In
the other parts, the SiO emission shows a very diﬀerent behavior
than the CO emission. This is especially apparent in two main
points.
First of all, there is very little SiO emission in the southern area
of the region. Despite strong H2 emission, which shows shock
activity, and several mm sources (see Fig. 3), which are often
identiﬁed with forming stars, the SiO abundance in this area is
very low.
A second unexpected point of the SiO abundance is that the
highest abundance occurs between the two main dust clumps,
a little apart from the continuum peaks, without strong evidence
of shocks or high energetic activities, such as H2 emission or
mm sources. Additionally, the emission has no counterpart in the
high-velocity CO data, where jets and outﬂows should be visi-
ble. The emission line at this position (Point 4) is comparably
thin and not shifted with respect to the rest velocity. These ob-
servations cannot be explained directly by the discussed theory.
However, there are some possible explanations for the diﬀerent
observations that we want to discuss in the following.

The ﬁrst observation to discuss here is the weak SiO emis-
sion around the southern continuum peak. Earlier observations
revealed a lot of mm-sources, strong H2 and CO emission in this
area. However, there is nearly no SiO emission around this re-
gion. This could be an eﬀect of geometry and the diﬀerent excita-
tion properties. The observed H2 and CO transitions need lower
densities to be excited than the SiO (2-1) line. Moreover, the
dust absorption of the 2.12 µm hydrogen emission is very high,
which could mean that the H2 emission emanate from the outer
parts of the main core, because the emission would otherwise be
absorbed by the dust. This also explains why the strong H2 emis-
sion is distributed around the main continuum peak. Therefore,
it could be a possibility that the outﬂows broke out of the cloud
into less dense areas, where the density is too low for SiO to get
excited.

Another consideration is

introduced by Gusdorf et al.
(2008a). When the Si is mainly found in the cores of the dust
grains in form of silicates, the conversion into SiO will introduce
a time delay. The magnitude of the delay depends on the shock
speed and the preshock gas density (nH). Gusdorf et al. (2008a)
ﬁnd an almost instantaneous conversion for high shock speed

tours (contour levels from 7 x 10−10 to 47 x 10−10 by 10 x 10−10). The

molecules, such as molecular hydrogen. Because we observed a
lot of H2 emission (see Fig. 3), pure J shocks are fairly improb-
able in this case, since they would dissociate the molecular hy-
drogen. Studies by Gusdorf et al. (2008b) have shown that even
CJ-type shocks at a velocity of 25 km s−1 are energetic enough to
dissociate the ambient hydrogen. However, in a more recent pa-
per, Gusdorf et al. (2015) have found that CJ-type shocks repro-
duce H2 observations even better. They found that C-type shocks
are not able to reproduce their H2 excitation temperatures. In
conclusion, the strong observed H2 emission suggests that we
are not observing J-type shocks; however, we cannot diﬀerenti-
ate further between C-type or CJ-type shocks with the present
data. Another important parameter of the shocks is the velocity.
However, it is very diﬃcult to estimate the shock velocity in the
current case. The SiO signal in the line wings is present until
15 km s−1 apart from the rest velocity. This is most likely not the
maximum shock velocity, as the strong SiO signal at ambient ve-
locity indicates jets or outﬂows with a large velocity component
in the plane of the sky. In conclusion, this means that SiO emis-
sion in this case can be the eﬀect of shocks with comparably high
velocities (vshock > 25 km s−1), because the expected C-type or
CJ-type shocks can reach very high velocities, depending on the
preshock density (Le Bourlot et al. 2002). These shocks would
most likely be a result of the ongoing star formation. However,
low-velocity shocks are also able to release the SiO if it is present
in the core mantles.

Considering the observations now, it is quite clear that there
is ongoing dust processing in the region, since the SiO abun-
dance is highly increased. In star-forming regions, such an in-

(vshock > 30 km s−1) and high gas densities (nH = 106 cm−3).
The time delay increases with lower shock speeds and densities
up to a delay of approximately 200 years for vshock = 25 km s−1
and nH = 106 cm−3. In our case, this should not be hugely impor-
tant, because Beuther et al. (2002d) found a dynamical timescale
for the outﬂows of 20000 years, and the CO data also suggest
evolved outﬂows (Beuther et al. 2003). However, Gusdorf et al.
(2008a) also ﬁnd that the SiO intensity decreases with the den-
sity of the cloud. This is because in high densities, OH and O2,
which are necessary to convert Si into SiO, are destroyed in the
shock wave. Consequently, it is possible that Si is present in the
gas phase, but is not visible as SiO. This could be a possible ex-
planation for the very dense southern regions. However, it would
only be possible if the Si is solely in the grain cores and not in the
mantles. The Si in the mantles is already in the form of SiO and
therefore needs no conversion. Because of the high SiO abun-
dance in the northern part, we generally expect Si in the grain
cores and mantles, which argues against this idea.

The second unexpected result was the high SiO abundance
apart from the main dust emission, found between the two main
gas clumps, without a counterpart in the high-velocity CO data,
and accompanied by comparably thin emission lines at rest ve-
locity. An usual explanation for comparably narrow SiO emis-
sion lines at ambient velocity is the idea that they trace post-
shock material, which is enriched with SiO thanks to the shock
and which has been decelerated and mixed with the ambient gas
(Leﬂoch et al. 1998; Gusdorf et al. 2008a). Depending on the
dynamics of the postshock gas, the lines are broader if the gas
still has a high velocity or the lines are narrower and have am-
bient velocity if the deceleration is almost complete. However,
the observed SiO abundance for decelerated outﬂows is usually
signiﬁcantly smaller than for broad components (Codella et al.
(1999); Jiménez-Serra et al. (2004) found abundances of around
10−11-10−10).

This abundance value is much lower than in our case, and
Gusdorf et al. (2008a) explain it as the mixing of postshock gas
with ambient gas. This interpretation also ﬁts the non-detection
in the high-velocity CO data, since the dynamics in the decel-
erated gas are lower. Interesting for the strength of the decel-
eration is the age of the outﬂow and the expected timescale.
Beuther et al. (2002d) found dynamical timescales of around
20000 years. This is quite large on the timescale of outﬂows,
which means that the outﬂows are already evolved, and the
idea of decelerated postshock gas is probable. However, the dy-
namical timescale is only a rough estimate, since Beuther et al.
(2002d) calculated it based on the assumption of two large out-
ﬂows.

Our main candidate for emission due to decelerated post-
shock gas is the emission peak around Point 4. This is one of
the narrowest emission lines (FWHM = 6.9 km s−1), and it has
no increased signal in the line wings, and it peaks at rest veloc-
ity. However, the line is still clearly broadened in comparison to
the corresponding H13CO+ line (FWHM = 1.8 km s−1, see Point
4 in Table B.1). Also, at this point, the SiO abundance is similar
to the other points with broader lines and not two or three mag-
nitudes smaller, as expected from Gusdorf et al. (2008a) for gas
that has been decelerated in ambient gas. One explanation could
be that the deceleration of the gas is caused by colliding out-
ﬂows that emanate from the northern and southern continuum
peaks. This would explain the emission line at ambient veloc-
ity and also the location of the emission between the two main
clumps. It also explains the high SiO abundance, since the two
colliding ﬂows both contain SiO-enriched postshock gas. There-

fore, two or more colliding outﬂows can be an explanation for
the emission feature around Point 4.

Another possibility for this emission was discussed by
Jiménez-Serra et al. (2010). They observed a similar feature with
a strong emission line oﬀset from the main continuum signal
and explained it by outﬂows from a nearby evolving protostar.
This would be an explanation on a smaller scale than the col-
liding outﬂows emanating from the main regions. There are two
NIR observations of the region by Beuther et al. (2002b) and by
Martín-Hernández et al. (2008b). However, the more recent ob-
servation has a diﬀerent ﬁeld of view, which is why we show the
data from Beuther et al. (2002b) in Fig. 3. There are two faint
sources a little north of Point 4, which have to be taken into
consideration in this case. However, both sources are very weak,
and Martín-Hernández et al. (2008b) only observed them in the
K Band and in the shorter wavelength of the Spitzer data (at 3.6
and 4.5 µm). The weakness of the sources and the non-detection
in longer Spitzer data, where one would expect a strong signal
for young protostars, makes it rather unlikely that these sources
are evolving protostars and that they cause the highly increased
SiO abundance. Therefore, the theory of colliding outﬂows is
more plausible in this case.

So far, we have only considered high-velocity shocks due
to protostellar jets. However, there are some studies that also
considered the possibility of SiO emission due to low-velocity
shocks (≤ 10 km s−1). This is a possibility that could explain
why the SiO emission lines are rather narrow and only slightly
shifted with respect to the velocity of rest. Nguyen-Lu’o’ng et al.
(2013) and Jiménez-Serra et al. (2010) have introduced the pos-
sibility of low-velocity shocks, which are most likely an eﬀect
of large converging ﬂows, such as cloud collision or interaction
between two ﬁlaments. Jiménez-Serra et al. (2010) consider this
possibility for emissions apart from the high-density structures.
This could also be a valid possibility for our region, since the
spectra from W43 (Nguyen-Lu’o’ng et al. 2013) are, in view of
line width and the velocity shift of the SiO line, comparable to
those from IRAS 19410 & 2336. Additionally, the shift in the
line peak in the present data lies with a maximum of 6.1 km s−1
(see Table B.1) far below the predicted shock velocity for high-
velocity shocks (vshock > 25 km s−1, Gusdorf et al. (2008a,b)).
This could be a hint of low-velocity shocks, but it could, as men-
tioned, also be an eﬀect of the projection in the observed plane
and the acceleration of environmental gas.
The main reason for Nguyen-Lu’o’ng et al. (2013) considering
low-velocity shocks due to large colliding ﬂows was the fact that
they observed large SiO structures with relatively uniform emis-
sion over the whole area. Again, this is in contrast to our obser-
vation that the whole southern part of IRAS 19410 & 2336 lacks
SiO emission. Therefore, a collision of ﬂows could again explain
the SiO emission in the middle of the region. Still, it cannot ex-
plain the only partially present SiO emission in the south or the
diﬀerences between SiO and CO data. Furthermore, the detec-
tion of H2 emission as a jet shock indicator in the south without
any SiO counterpart could not be explained by this.

5. Conclusion

After combining the diﬀerent results, we found that the SiO
emission is most likely caused by high-velocity C-type or CJ-
type shocks probably from protostellar jets. This explains the
emission in the northern part, as well as the observed line widths.
The emission in the middle of the region could be a result of de-
celerated postshock gas due to two or more colliding outﬂows.
The only part of the observation that does not ﬁt this explanation

is the missing SiO emission in the southern region. The observed
H2 emission clearly shows shock activity, and the CO data ex-
hibit several bipolar structures. The most valid explanation for
us is that there is ongoing jet and outﬂow activity in the southern
part, which is not visible in the SiO data. The missing SiO emis-
sion could be a result of the diﬀerent excitation properties of the
molecules and the shock geometry. When the shocks break out
of the densest area, as the H2 data suggest, the density could be
too low for SiO to get excited. However, the opposite explana-
tion that SiO is also not visible owing to densities that are too
high in the core has to be considered here.

Our ﬁnal conclusion from this observation is that SiO emis-
sion has to be used with some caution, because a lot of eﬀects
can have an inﬂuence on the emission. This is nicely shown by
the observed region, since it can be divided into three diﬀerent
parts, which all show a completely diﬀerent SiO morphology.
Especially the southern area of IRAS 19410+2336 leads to the
conclusion that SiO should only be used as a shock tracer in the
sense that if one observes SiO emission, it is most likely an eﬀect
of shocks. However, the reverse argument that a non-detection of
SiO also means no existing shocks is certainly not valid because
several diﬀerent eﬀects can inﬂuence the SiO emission.

Appendix A: SiO Abundance

The abundance map of SiO is calculated from the column den-
sity maps of H13CO+ and SiO. To calculate the column den-
sities from the emission lines, we used the calculations from
Hezareh et al. (2008):

Nu =

8πkν2
hc3Aul

τ

(1 − e−τ) Z Tbdν.

The total column density can then be calculated with

Ntot = Nu

U(Tex)

gu

exp  Eu

kTex! .

(A.1)

(A.2)

In the equation, Aul is the Einstein coeﬃcient for a given tran-
sition with gu and Eu/k, the upper state degeneracy and temper-
ature with the Boltzmann constant k. Here, Tex is the excitation
temperature and U(Tex) is the partition function at this tempera-
ture, and Tb is the brightness temperature, which we derive from
the data. In the calculations, we assume that the excitation tem-
perature is equal to the kinetic temperature, which should be ap-
proximately correct at the given high densities. As temperature,
40 K is used (Rodón et al. 2012) and τ is the optical depth. For
the assumption of optically thin lines holds τ ≪ 1, and the fac-
tor τ/(1 −e−τ) approaches unity. This assumption is probably not
true for the denser part of the SiO map. This means that the map
only gives a lower limit for the column density, especially at the
densest points. For more information on the column density and
a derivation of the used formulas, see Hezareh et al. (2008) and
Tielens (2005).
The column density maps calculated from the H13CO+ and SiO
data can be seen in Fig. A.1

With the help of Fig. A.1, it is possible to calculate the
abundance of SiO with respect to H2. Therefore, it is neces-
sary to know the column density of H2. At this point we as-
sume that the distribution of H2 is roughly the same as the one
from H13CO+. This assumption is reasonable, as it can be seen
in Fig. A.2. The ﬁgure shows that the H13CO+ distribution de-
scribes the dust continuum emission well, which is directly re-
lated to the H2 distribution. To get the column density of H2,
we only need the H13CO+ to H2 abundance. This information
can be obtained from Gerner et al. (2014). They investigated

The ﬁnal abundance map is the quotient of the column density
maps from SiO and H13CO+ multiplied with the aforementioned

map, which can be seen in Fig. 4.
