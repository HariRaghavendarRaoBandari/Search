A BOCHNER TYPE CLASSIFICATION THEOREM FOR EXCEPTIONAL

ORTHOGONAL POLYNOMIALS

Ma ´ANGELES GARC´IA-FERRERO, DAVID G ´OMEZ-ULLATE, AND ROBERT MILSON

Abstract. It was recently conjectured that every system of exceptional orthogonal polyno-
mials is related to classical orthogonal polynomials by a sequence of Darboux transformations.
In this paper we prove this conjecture, which paves the road to a complete classiﬁcation of
all exceptional orthogonal polynomials.
In some sense, this paper can be regarded as the
extension of Bochner’s result for classical orthogonal polynomials to the exceptional class.
As a supplementary result, we derive a canonical form for exceptional operators based on a
bilinear formalism, and prove that every exceptional operator has trivial monodromy at all
primary poles.

1. Introduction

Exceptional orthogonal polynomials are complete systems of orthogonal polynomials that
satisfy a Sturm-Liouville problem. They diﬀer from the classical families of Hermite, Laguerre
and Jacobi in that there are a ﬁnite number of exceptional degrees for which no polynomial
eigenfunction exists. The total number of gaps in the degree sequence is the codimension
of the exceptional family. As opposed to their classical counterparts [1, 2], the diﬀerential
equation contains rational instead of polynomial coeﬃcients, yet the eigenvalue problem has an
inﬁnite number of polynomial eigenfunctions that form the basis of a weighted Hilbert space.
Because of the missing degrees, exceptional polynomials circumvent the strong limitations
of Bochner’s classiﬁcation theorem, which characterizes classical Sturm-Liouville orthogonal
polynomial systems [3, 4].

The recent development of exceptional polynomial systems has received contributions both
from the mathematics community working on orthogonal polynomials and special functions,

and from mathematical physicists. Among the physical applications, exceptional polynomial
systems appear mostly as solutions to exactly solvable quantum mechanical problems, describ-
ing both bound states [5–13] and scattering amplitudes [14–17]. But there are also connections
with super-integrability [18, 19] and higher order symmetry algebras [20–22], diﬀusion equa-
tions and random processes [23–25], quantum information entropy [26], exact solutions to
Dirac equation [27] and ﬁnite-gap potentials [28].

Some examples of exceptional polynomials were investigated back in the early 90s, [29]
but their systematic study started a few years ago, where a full classiﬁcation was given for
codimension one, [30, 31]. Soon after that, Quesne recognised the role of Darboux transfor-
mations in the construction process and wrote the ﬁrst codimension two examples, [32], and
Odake & Sasaki showed families for arbitrary codimension, [10, 33]. The role of Darboux
transformations was further clariﬁed in a number of works, [11, 34, 35], and the next con-
ceptual step involved the generation of exceptional families by multiple-step or higher order
Darboux transformations, leading to exceptional families labelled by multi-indices, [36–38].
Other equivalent approaches to build exceptional polynomial systems have been developed in
the physics literature, using the prepotential approach [39] or the symmetry group preserving
the form of the Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger equation [40], leading to rational extensions of the well
known solvable potentials.

In the mathematical literature, two main questions have centered the research activity
in relation to exceptional polynomial systems: describing their mathematical properties and
achieving a complete classiﬁcation. Among the mathematical properties, the study of their
zeros deserve particular attention. Zeros of exceptional polynomials are classiﬁed into two
classes: regular zeros which lie in the interval of orthogonality and exceptional zeros, which
lie outside this interval. Their interlacing, asymptotic behaviour, monotonicity as a function
of parameters and electrostatic interpretation have been investigated in a number of works,
[41–45], but there are still open problems in this direction.

A fundamental object in the theory of orthogonal polynomials is the recurrence relation.
Classical orthogonal polynomials have a three term recurrence relation, but exceptional poly-
nomial systems have recurrence relations whose order is higher than three. There is a set of
recurrence relations of order 2N + 3 where N is the number of Darboux steps [5, 46] with
coeﬃcients that are functions of x and n, and another set of recurrence relations whose coef-
ﬁcients are just functions of n (as in the classical case) and whose order is 2m + 3 where m
is the codimension, [47–49]. While the former relations are generally of lower order and thus
more convenient for an eﬃcient computation, the latter are more amenable to a theoretical
interpretation in terms of the usual theory of Jacobi matrices and bispectrality. The spec-
tral theoretic aspects of exceptional diﬀerential operators were ﬁrst addressed in [50, 51] and
developed more recently in a series of papers [52–54].

The quest for a complete classiﬁcation of exceptional polynomials has been fundamental
problem that is now close to being solved, and the results in the present paper are a key step
towards this goal. The ﬁrst attempts to classify exceptional polynomial systems proceeded
by increasing codimension. Codimension one systems were classiﬁed in [30] and they included
just one X1-Laguerre and one X1-Jacobi family. The classiﬁcation for codimension two was
performed in [55], based on an exhaustive case-by-case enumeration of invariant ﬂags under
a given symmetry group. Due to the combinatorial growth of complexity with increasing
codimension, this original approach proved to be unfeasible for the purpose of achieving a
complete classiﬁcation. However, a fundamental idea towards the full classiﬁcation was also

3

launched in [55], namely that every exceptional polynomial system can be obtained from a
classical system by applying a ﬁnite number of Darboux transformations. More precisely, the
following conjecture was formulated:

Conjecture 1.1. [G´omez-Ullate, Kamran, Milson 2012] Every exceptional orthogonal poly-
nomial system of codimension m can be obtained by applying a sequence of at most m Darboux
transformations to a classical orthogonal polynomial system.

If the conjecture holds, then the program to classify exceptional polynomial systems be-
comes constructive: start from the three classical systems of Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi
and apply all possible Darboux transformations to describe the entire exceptional class. It
should be stressed that only rational Darboux transformations need to be considered, i.e.
those that map polynomial eigenfunctions into polynomial eigenfunctions, and this type of
transformations are well understood and catalogued, and they are indexed by sequences of
integers. This constructive approach has already been used to generate large classes of ex-
ceptional polynomial systems. The most general class obtained in this way can be labelled
by two sets of indices or partitions (for the Laguerre and Jacobi classes) [56] or just one set
(for the Hermite class) [5] which can be conveniently represented in a Maya diagram [57], a
representation that takes naturally into account a number of equivalent sets of indices that
lead to the same exceptional system, [58]. However, the question of whether this list contains
all exceptional polynomials remained open.

In all examples known so far, the weight for the exceptional system W (z) is a rational

modiﬁcation of a classical weight W0(z) having the following form:

(1)

W (z) =

W0(z)
η(z)2 ,

where η(z) is a polynomial in z (a Wronskian-like determinant) whose degree coincides with
the codimension of the system. In this paper we prove that this is indeed the case for any
possible exceptional polynomial system.

One important point remains, namely that of ensuring that the transformed weight gives
rise to a well deﬁned spectral problem, which we shall refer to as the weight regularity problem.
This means studying the sequence of Darboux transformations and the range of parameters
for which:

i) the weight has the right asymptotic behaviour at the endpoints
ii) η(z) has no zeros inside the interval of orthogonality.

The regularity problem has been solved for the exceptional Hermite class [5, 59] based on
results by Krein [60], and Adler [61], and also for the Laguerre class, [62], using a remarkable
correspondence between exceptional polynomials and discrete Krall type polynomials, [56].

The main result of this paper is the following theorem, which is essentially a proof of

Conjecture 1.1, albeit without a bound on the number of Darboux steps.

Theorem 1.2. Every exceptional orthogonal polynomial system can be obtained by applying
a ﬁnite sequence of Darboux transformations to a classical orthogonal polynomial system.

The essential consequence of this result is that it places on safe ground the constructive
approach to the full classiﬁcation described above. The strategy of the proof involves several
steps.

First, we establish a number of factorization results for second-order order diﬀerential
operators with rational coeﬃcients. In particular, in Section 3 we show that every higher-
order intertwiner can be factorized into a composition of ﬁrst order operators, each of them
corresponding to a one-step, rational Darboux transformation.

We introduce exceptional operators in Section 4, and prove a fundamental theorem that
relates the codimension to the sum of certain integer indices at the poles of the operator.
Next, in section 5 we prove that every exceptional operator admits a canonical formulation as a
bilinear relation between two polynomials. The key technical tools are some results on the local
behaviour of solutions around the singular points of the diﬀerential equations corresponding
to exceptional operators. A further key step is the demonstration that an exceptional operator
has trivial monodromy at almost every point ζ ∈ C. This result was already known for the
exceptional Hermite class [5,63], and we show that it can be extended to a general exceptional
operator. The connection between trivial monodromy, bispectrality, Darboux transformations
and the solvable character of Schr¨odinger operators has been discussed in a number of papers
(see for instance [63–68] and the references therein), and the results in this paper are one
further piece of evidence of the close relationship among these concepts.

In Section 6 we build on the structural properties of exceptional operators to prove the
existence of a higher order intertwiner between any exceptional operator and a classical oper-
ator, extending the proof given by Oblomkov [63] for the rational extensions of the harmonic
oscillator.

Finally the proof of Theorem 1.2 is given in Section 7 making use of all the previous
results. This section also contains Theorem 7.2 which states that the orthogonality weight for
any exceptional polynomial system has the form (1).

2. Preliminaries

In this preliminary section we introduce some key deﬁnitions and notation, and prove
some essential results about second-order diﬀerential operators with rational coeﬃcients. Let
Q = C(z) denote the diﬀerential ring of univariate, complex-valued rational functions and
P = C[z] the subring of polynomials. Let Pn ⊂ P, n ∈ N denote the vector space of
polynomials of degree ≤ n, and P ∗
n ⊂ Pn the subset of polynomials whose degree is exactly
equal to n.

Let Diﬀ(Q) = C(z)[Dz] denote the ring of linear diﬀerential operators with rational coeﬃ-
cients and Diﬀ(P) = C[z, Dz] the subring of operators with polynomial coeﬃcients. Alterna-
tively, Diﬀ(P) may be characterized as the subring of Diﬀ(Q) that preserves P. When needed,
will use RQ, RP, RPn to denote the corresponding real-valued subrings and subspaces, and
Diﬀ(RQ), Diﬀ(RP) the corresponding rings of real-valued diﬀerential operators.

For a suﬃciently diﬀerentiable function y, we let Dj

y(z) with respect to z. The notation Dzz = D2
the set of ρth order diﬀerential operators; that is, operators of the form

zy = y(j)(z) denote the jth derivative of
z will also be employed. Let Diﬀ ρ(Q) denote

Deﬁnition 2.1. We say that a function φ(z) is quasi-rational if its log-derivative

Dzh log φ(z)i =

φ′(z)
φ(z)

is a rational function of z.

For T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q), write

(4)

T = p(z)Dzz + q(z)Dz + r(z),

p, q, r ∈ Q

and deﬁne the quasi-rational functions

p(x)

dx(cid:19) ,

W (z) =

P (z)

,

R(z) = r(z)W (z).

Multiplying the eigenvalue relation T [y] = λy by W (z) gives an equivalent form as Sturm-
Liouville type equation

(6)

(P y′)′ + Ry = λW y.

Proposition 2.2. The operator T is formally symmetric with respect to W in the sense that

(7)

Z z

T [f ](x)g(x)W (x)dx −Z z

T [g](x)f (x)W (x)dx = P (z)(f ′(z)g(z) − f (z)g′(z)),

where f, g are suﬃciently diﬀerentiable functions.

Proof. This follows by (6) and integration by parts.

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 2.3. We say that two rational operators T, ˆT ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) are gauge-equivalent if
there exists a σ ∈ Q such that

(8)

σT = ˆT σ.

We will refer to σ as the gauge-factor.

Remark 2.4. Above we are using σ to denote both a rational function, and the multiplication
operator y 7→ σy. The reason for the gauge-factor terminology is that the eigenvalue relation
T [y] = λy is equivalent to the eigenvalue relation ˆT [ˆy] = λˆy, with ˆy = σy.

Proposition 2.5. Let T, ˆT ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) be gauge equivalent by a gauge factor σ. Letting
p, q, r, ˆp, ˆq, ˆr be the coeﬃcients of T and ˆT as per (4), and W, ˆW the corresponding weights

3. Rational Darboux transformations

The gauge-equivalence relation (8) is an intertwining relation of second-order operators
by a zero-order multiplication operator. Consideration of higher-order intertwining relations
leads naturally to the notion of a Darboux transformation.

Deﬁnition 3.1. For T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) a rational factorization is a relation of the form
(10)

T = BA + λ,

where A, B ∈ Diﬀ 1(Q) and λ ∈ C is a constant. Given a rational factorization, we call the
operator ˆT ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) deﬁned by
(11)
the partner operator and say that T 7→ ˆT is a rational Darboux transformation.
Proposition 3.2. Suppose that T, ˆT ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) are related by a rational Darboux transfor-
mation. Then, the following intertwining relations hold

ˆT := AB + λ

(12)

AT = ˆT A,

T B = B ˆT .

Proof. This is a direct consequence of (10) and (11).

(cid:3)

Remark 3.3. The intertwining relation (12) implies that the eigenvalue relation T [y] = λy
is formally equivalent to the eigenvalue relation ˆT [ˆy] = λˆy where ˆy = A[y].

Deﬁnition 3.4. For T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) and φ(z) quasi-rational, we will say that φ is a quasi-
rational eigenfunction of T if

(13)

T [φ] = λφ,

λ ∈ C.

Proposition 3.5. For T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q), let φ(z) be a quasi-rational eigenfunction of T with
eigenvalue λ, and let b(z) be an arbitrary, non-zero rational function. Deﬁne rational functions

(14)

(15)

A = b(z)(Dz − w(z)),

B = ˆb(z)(Dz − ˆw(z)).

With A, B as above, the rational factorization relation (10) holds. Moreover, w is a solution
of the Ricatti equation

(16)

p(w′ + w2) + qw + r = λ.

Conversely, given a rational factorization (10), there exists a quasi-rational eigenfunction
φ(z) with eigenvalue λ and a rational b(z) such that (14), (15), and (16) hold.

Proof. By (13) we have

pφ′′

The Ricatti relation (16) follows immediately. Applying (14), (15), and (16) we have

(BA)[y] = B[by′ − bwy]

We now prove the converse. Suppose that (10) holds. Let b(z), w(z), ˆb(z), ˆw(z) be rational

functions dictated by the form (15). Deﬁne the quasi-rational function

so that w = φ′/φ. Then, (13) follows from (10). Expanding (BA)[y], as above shows that

φ(z) = exp(cid:18)Z z

w(x)dx(cid:19)

p = ˆbb,

q = ˆbb′ − ˆbb(w + ˆw),

r − λ = w ˆwbˆb − ˆb(bw)′.

From this (14) and (16) follow immediately.
Proposition 3.6. Suppose that T, ˆT ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) are related by a rational Darboux trans-
formation. Then, T, ˆT have the same second-order coeﬃcients, while ﬁrst- and zero-order
coeﬃcients q, ˆq, r, ˆr ∈ Q, and the quasi-rational weights W (z), ˆW (z), as deﬁned by (5b), are
related by

where p(z) is the second-order coeﬃcient of both T, ˆT , and where b(z), ˆw(z) are the rational
functions deﬁned in Proposition 3.5.
Proof. By (10)- (15), p(z) is the second-order coeﬃcient of both T, ˆT . Let ˆq(z) ∈ Q be the
ﬁrst-order coeﬃcient of ˆT . Relation (17) follows by (14) (15) and (11). Applying (5) and
using (17) gives (19). Considering the hatted dual of (16) and applying (14) and (17) gives

ˆr = λ − p( ˆw′ + ˆw2) − ˆq ˆw,

(cid:3)

Next, we consider iterated rational Darboux transformations. In the context of Schr¨odinger
operators, these are known as higher-order Darboux or Darboux-Crum transformations. [69].

8

Ma ´ANGELES GARC´IA-FERRERO, DAVID G ´OMEZ-ULLATE, AND ROBERT MILSON

Deﬁnition 3.7. Let ˆT , T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) be second-order operators with rational coeﬃcients. We
will say that ˆT is Darboux connected to T if there exists an L ∈ Diﬀ(Q) such that

(20)

ˆT L = LT.

Remark 3.8. Note that gauge-equivalent operators (8) are Darboux connected by deﬁnition,
because they are related by a zeroth order intertwining relation.
Deﬁnition 3.9. We will say that ˆT , T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) are connected by a factorization chain if
there exist second-order operators Ti ∈ Diﬀ(Q), i = 0, 1, . . . , n with T0 = T and Tn = ˆT ;
ﬁrst-order operators Ai, Bi ∈ Diﬀ 1(Q), i = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1, and constants λi such that

(21)

(22)

Ti = BiAi + λi,
Ti+1 = AiBi + λi.

i = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1

It is trivial to show that two operators connected by a factorization chain are also Darboux
connected. However, much less known is the fact that the converse is also true, as shown by
the following theorem.
Theorem 3.10. Two rational operators T, ˆT ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) are Darboux connected if and only
if they are either gauge-equivalent, or they are connected by a factorization chain.
Proof. Suppose that T and ˆT are connected by a factorization chain. By assumption,

Ti+1Ai = AiBiAi + λiAi = AiTi,

i = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1.

It follows by induction that

Therefore, (20) is satisﬁed with

Ti+1Ai · · · A0 = Ai · · · A0T0.

L = An−1 · · · A1 · A0.

The proof of the converse is a modiﬁcation of an argument given in [63]. If ord L = 0, then

T and ˆT are gauge-equivalent. Thus, suppose that (20) holds and that ord L ≥ 1.

Claim 1: no generality is lost if we assume that L does not have a right factor of the form

T − λ. Indeed, suppose that

L = ˜L(T − λ),

λ ∈ C.

Since T commutes with T − λ, it follows that

ˆT ˜L = ˜LT

is a lower order intertwining relation between ˆT and T . Repeating this argument a ﬁnite
number of times yields an intertwiner L with the desired property.

Claim 2: T leaves ker L invariant. By relation (20), if y ∈ ker L, then

so T [y] ∈ ker L also.

Claim 3: if T [y] = λy, then

L(cid:2)T [y](cid:3) = ˆT(cid:2)L[y](cid:3) = 0,

(23)

L[y] = F (z, λ)y + G(z, λ)y′,

where F, G are polynomial in λ and rational in z. By assumption,

T [y] = p(z)y′′ + q(z)y′ + r(z)y = λy

9

where p(z), q(z), r(z) are rational in z. We have thus that

y′′ = −

q(z)
p(z)

y′ +

λ − r(z)

p(z)

y,

and hence a higher order derivative y(k), k ≥ 2 can always be written as a linear combination
of y and y′ with coeﬃcients that are polynomial in λ and rational in z.

Since ker L is ﬁnite-dimensional and invariant with respect to T , let us choose an eigenvector

φ ∈ ker L of T with eigenvalue λ0. It follows that

F (z, λ0)φ + G(z, λ0)φ′ = 0,

with F, G deﬁned above.

Claim 4: G(z, λ0) is not identically zero. If ord L = 1 the claim is trivial. For ord L ≥ 2 we
argue by contradiction and suppose that G(z, λ0) ≡ 0. Then, F (z, λ0) ≡ 0 also. Let ψ(z) be
a second, independent solution of

T [ψ] = λ0ψ.

By (23), L[ψ] = 0 also. Let ρ be the order of L. Choose polynomials π1, . . . , πρ−1 so that
π1, . . . , πρ−1, φ, ψ are linearly independent. Set

fi = (T − λ0)[πi],

gi = L[πi],

i = 1, . . . , ρ − 1.

Suppose that k1, . . . , kρ−1 ∈ C are constants such that Pi kifi = 0. Then,

(T − λ0)"Xi

kiπi# = 0.

Observe that dim ker(T − λ0) = 2 because T is second-order. Hence {φ, ψ} span ker(T − λ0),

and Pi kiπi must be a linear combination of φ and ψ. Since π1, . . . , πρ−1, φ, ψ are linearly

independent, it follows that ki = 0. Hence, f1, . . . , fρ−1 are linearly independent, and there
exist rational functions a0(z), a1(z), . . . , aρ−2(z) that satisfy the linear relations

aj(z)f (j)

i

(z) = gi(z),

i = 1, . . . , ρ − 1.

Deﬁne the operator

and observe that by construction

˜L(T − λ0)[πi] = L[πi],
˜L(T − λ0)[φ] = 0,
˜L(T − λ0)[ψ] = 0.

i = 1, . . . , ρ − 1,

We see thus that L and ˜L(T − λ0) are diﬀerential operators of order ρ whose action on ρ + 1
linearly independent functions coincides. Hence, L = ˜L(T −λ0), which violates the reducibility
assumption established by Claim 1, and thereby establishes Claim 4.

Thus, G(z, λ0) is not identically zero, and therefore,
F (z, λ0)

is a rational function. Set T0 = T and L0 = L. By Proposition 3.5, there exists a rational
factorization

with A0[φ] = 0. Since φ ∈ ker L we also have a rational factorization

T = B0A0 + λ0

Setting

we have

which implies that

L = L1A0, L1 ∈ Diﬀ(Q).

T1 = A0B0 + λ0

( ˆT L1 − L1T1)A0 = 0

ˆT L1 = L1T1.

Claim 5: L1 has no right factors of the form T1 − λ. Suppose otherwise, so that

Then, setting ˜λ = λ − λ0 we have

L1 = ˜L(T1 − λ).

L = L1A0 = ˜L(A0B0 − ˜λ)A0 = ˜LA0(B0A0 − ˜λ) = ˜LA0(T − λ),

which again violates the irreducibility assumption of Claim 1.

Continuing by induction, we have

ˆT Li = LiTi,

i = 0, 1, . . .

with Li reduced. Repeating the above argument, we construct rational factorizations

Ti = BiAi + λi, Ti+1 = AiBi + λi,

so that

and

L = Li+1Ai · · · A0

ˆT Li+1 = Li+1Ti+1,

and so that Li+1 is reduced as per Claim 1. This process terminates when Li is a ﬁrst-
order operator, because then we can take Li = Ai, which gives ˆT = Ti+1, and completes the
factorization chain that connects ˆT and T .
(cid:3)

Corollary 3.11. The property of being Darboux connected is an equivalence relation on
Diﬀ 2(Q).

Proof. Reﬂexivity of the relation is self-evident. We need to prove that the Darboux connected
relation possesses both symmetry and transitivity. Suppose (20) holds. If L = µ is zero-order
then,

T µ−1 = µ−1 ˆT ,

so that T is Darboux connected to ˆT . If ord L ≥ 1 then ˆT and T are related by a factorization
chain. By inspection of the deﬁnition, the property of being connected by a factorization

11

chain is symmetric; one simply switches the Ai and the Bi and reverses the order of the
factorization chain.

Next suppose that

T1L1 = L1T2, T2L2 = L2T3,

where T1, T2, T3 ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) and L1, L2 ∈ Diﬀ(Q). Then, by associativity of operator compo-
sition,

T1L1L2 = L1T2L2 = L1L2T3,

so that T1 is Darboux connected to T3.

4. Exceptional operators and characterization of U

Deﬁnition 4.1. A second-order operator T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) is exceptional if T has a polynomial
eigenfunction for all but ﬁnitely many degrees. To be more precise, there exists a ﬁnite set of
natural numbers {k1, . . . , km} ⊂ N such that for all k /∈ {k1, . . . , km}, there exists a yk ∈ P ∗
k
and a λk ∈ C such that

T [yk] = λkyk,

and such that no such polynomial exists if k ∈ {k1, . . . , km}. We will refer to k1, . . . , km as
the exceptional degrees.

Remark 4.2. Note that in the above deﬁnition of an exceptional diﬀerential operator, m
could be zero, i.e. exceptional operators include classical operators as a special case. In the
recent literature on this subject, the adjective exceptional
is usually reserved for the case
m > 0 to diﬀerentiate them from the classical ones. However, for the purpose of this paper it
is convenient to handle the general class. Thus, in order not to introduce further notation, we
will stick to the term exceptional in this wider context, hoping that no confusion will arise.

Remark 4.3. No generality is lost by assuming that an exceptional operator has rational
coeﬃcients. See Proposition 2.1 of [70] for more details.

Observe that if T is an exceptional operator with eigenpolynomials yk ∈ P ∗
k and σ ∈
n, n ≥ 1 a non-trivial polynomial, then the gauge-equivalent operator ˜T = σT σ−1 is also
P ∗
exceptional with eigenpolynomials ˜yk+n = σyk. However, every equivalence class of gauge-
equivalent exceptional operators admits a distinguished gauge, as per the following.

Deﬁnition 4.4. We will say that an exceptional operator is in reduced gauge, if the corre-
sponding eigenpolynomials do not all share a common root.

For sake of brevity we will sometimes shorten the expression “an operator in reduced gauge”

to the simpler “reduced operator”.

Proposition 4.5. Every equivalence class of gauge-equivalent exceptional operators contains
a reduced operator, which is unique up to a choice of scalar multiple.
Proof. Suppose that ˜T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) is exceptional with eigenpolynomials ˜yk ∈ P ∗
be a maximal common polynomial factor of the ˜yk. Then, the operator

k . Let σ ∈ P

T = σ−1 ˜T σ,

admits polynomial eigenfunctions σ−1 ˜yk ∈ P ∗

Example 4.6. Unreduced operators are, for all practical purposes, equivalent to their reduced
counterpart. For example, consider the classical Hermite diﬀerential equation

y′′ − 2zy′ + 2ny = 0, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

whose polynomial solutions are the classical Hermite polynomials y = Hn(z). One could
instead consider the polynomials ˆHn(z) = (1 + z2)Hn−2(z), n ≥ 2. By construction, y = ˆHn
is a solution of the diﬀerential equation

y′′ − 2(cid:18)z +

2z

1 + z2(cid:19) y′ +(cid:18)4 + 2n +

2

1 + z2 −

8

(1 + z2)2(cid:19) y = 0,

which is obtained by conjugating the classical Hermite operator by the multiplication operator
1 + z2. The ordinary hermite polynomials are orthogonal on (−∞, ∞) relative to the weight
, and hence by construction the modiﬁed polynomials ˆHn(z) are orthogonal relative to
e−z2
/(1 + z2)2. Thus, ˆHn, n ≥ 2 constitute a family of exceptional orthogonal
the weight e−z2
polynomials with 2 missing degrees. This type of construction is quite general, but does not
produce genuinely new orthogonal polynomials.

Deﬁnition 4.7. For an exceptional operator T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q), let U ⊂ P denote the maximal
invariant polynomial subspace, and ν the codimension of U in P.

Proposition 4.8. An equivalent characterization of U is

(24)

U = {y ∈ P : T j[y] ∈ P for all j ∈ N}.

Proof. Let U ′ denote the subspace deﬁned by the right side of (24). For all y ∈ U ′ we have
T [y] ∈ U ′ by deﬁnition. Hence, U ′ is T -invariant, and hence U ′ ⊂ U . On the other hand, if
y ∈ U then T j[y] ∈ U ⊂ P for all j ∈ N. Therefore, U ⊂ U ′, also.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 4.9. Let T be an exceptional operator. We say that T is polynomially semi-simple
if the action of T on every ﬁnite-dimensional, invariant polynomial subspace is diagonalizable.
We will say that T is polynomially regular if there exists a positive-deﬁnite inner product on
P relative to which the action of T is symmetric.

Remark 4.10. By (24), U contains all eigenpolynomials of T , which means that ν ≤ m < ∞,
where m is the number of exceptional degrees as per Deﬁnition 4.1. If T is also polynomially
semi-simple, then U may be characterized as the span of the eigenpolynomials of T , in which
case ν = m. However, in general U may contain polynomials that are not eigenvectors of T ,
in which case ν < m strictly.

The polynomial semi-simplicity condition has not been considered previously in the litera-
ture. Rather in the context of orthogonal polynomial systems (see Section 7 for more details),
the usual assumption is that T is related to a Sturm-Liouville operator with polynomial eigen-
functions, which under suitable assumptions (see Section 7) implies that T is polynomially
regular. By the ﬁnite-dimensional Spectral Theorem, if T is polynomially regular, as per
Deﬁnition 4.9, then the T -action on invariant, ﬁnite-dimensional, polynomial subspaces is
diagonalizable. In other words, regularity implies semi-simplicity.

To illustrate the above remark, consider the following example.

Example 4.11. The operator

T [y] = (1 − z2)y′′ + 2(z − 2)y′

is the α = 0, β = −4 instance of the classical Jacobi operator. This instance is degenerate,
because the leading coeﬃcient of the classical Jacobi polynomials is

13

P α,β

n (z) =(cid:18)α + β + 2n

n

(cid:19)2−nzn + lower degree terms.

Indeed, with the above choice of the α, β parameters, the third-degree Jacobi polynomial P α,β
degenerates to a constant. The constant y = 1 is an eigenfunction, but observe that

3

T [z3 + 6z2 + 21z] = −72.

Hence, the vector space spanned by z3 + 6z2 + 21z and 1 is T -invariant, but the action is
not diagonalizable. However, the Jacobi polynomials of all other degrees are eigenfunctions,
so T does ﬁt the deﬁnition of an exceptional operator. Regularity for Jacobi polynomials
requires that α, β > −1. Since our example violates this assumption, there is no well-deﬁned
inner product. This lack of an inner-product permits an operator with an action that is not
semi-simple.

For the remainder of this section, T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) refers to an arbitrary exceptional operator
with coeﬃcients p, q, r ∈ Q as per (4). By a pole of T we mean a pole of one of these
coeﬃcients.

Deﬁnition 4.12. For a meromorphic function f (z) and ζ ∈ C, we deﬁne ordζ f to be the
degree of the leading term in the Laurent expansion of f ; i.e. k = ordζ f is the largest integer
such that (z − ζ)−kf (z) is bounded near z = ζ. For example, ordζ f = 1 if f (z) is analytic
with a simple root at z = ζ and ordζ f = −2 if z = ζ is a double pole of f (z).

Deﬁnition 4.13. Let T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) be an exceptional operator and U ⊂ P its maximally
invariant polynomial subspace. For a given ζ ∈ C, we deﬁne the order sequence of T at ζ as

(25)

Iζ = {ordζ y : y ∈ U }.

Let νζ be the cardinality of N\Iζ; that is, the number of gaps in the order sequence.

Remark 4.14. An equivalent deﬁnition of the order sequence is that there exists a basis of
U with polynomials

(26)

yk(z) = (z − ζ)k + higher order terms,

k ∈ Iζ.

We are now ready to state our ﬁrst main result.

Theorem 4.15. Let ζ1, . . . , ζN ∈ C be the poles of an exceptional operator T , and let νi =
νζi, i = 1, . . . , N be the cardinalities of the order gaps as per the above deﬁnition. Then, each
νi is ﬁnite, and moreover the codimension of the maximal invariant polynomial subspace U is
given by

The proof is based on a number of preliminary results, some of which will also be needed

in subsequent sections.

Proof. By deﬁnition, it is not possible to choose more than ν linearly independent polynomials
that are not in U . The polynomials {(z − ζ)n : n /∈ Iζ} are linearly independent and not in U .
Therefore, there are at most ν of them.

Proposition 4.18. A diﬀerential functional supported at ζ ∈ C cannot be given as a ﬁnite
linear combination of diﬀerential functionals with support at other points.

Proof. For i = 1, . . . , m, let αi : P → U be diﬀerential functionals of order ki with support at
ζi ∈ C. Suppose that α is a diﬀerential functional of order k supported at ζ /∈ {ζ1, . . . , ζm}.

y(z) = b(z)

m

i = 1, . . . , m.

It suﬃces then to show that α[y] 6= 0 for some choice of b.

Suppose not and observe that

By the rank-nullity theorem, dim(ker α ∩ Pk) = k. Since dim Pk = k + 1, there exists a b ∈ Pk
such that the corresponding y(z) is divisible by (z − ζ)k+1, which is impossible.

5. Structure theorems for exceptional operators

Deﬁnition 5.1. Let T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) be a second-order rational operator,

T = p(z)Dzz + q(z)Dz + r(z).

We say that T admits a bilinear formulation, if p ∈ P2 and there exist polynomials s ∈ P1
and η, µ ∈ P such that the eigenvalue equation T [y] = λy is equivalent to the relation

(30) p(ηy′′ − 2η′y′ + η′′y) +

which, by inspection, is bilinear in y and η.

p′(ηy′ + η′y) + s(ηy′ − η′y) +(cid:0)2p(log µ)′′ + p′(log µ)′(cid:1) ηy = λyη,

Deﬁnition 5.2. A second order operator T is in the natural gauge, or more simply, T is a
natural operator if it admits a bilinear formulation of the type (30) where µ is a constant,
that is if the bilinear relation takes the particularly simple form

(31)

We are now ready to state the main result of this section, which is a structure theorem for

the coeﬃcients of an exceptional operator.

Theorem 5.4. Every exceptional operator is gauge equivalent to a natural operator.

Remark 5.5. Taken Theorem 5.4 as proven, we see that every class of gauge-equivalent
exceptional operators has two distinguished gauges: the reduced gauge (Deﬁntion 4.4) and
the natural gauge (Deﬁntion 5.2).

Usually, these two choices of gauge are the same, but this is not always the case. Example
5.6 below illustrates one such instance where the natural and reduced gauges diﬀer.
It is
probable that the discrepancy between the natural and reduced gauges is related to the
conﬂuence of zeros in the denominator polynomial η(z) of the exceptional weight [71, 72].

Example 5.6. The following example illustrates the diﬀerence between the natural and re-
duced gauge of an exceptional operator. The example is based on the following family of
two-step exceptional Laguerre polynomials [36]. Let L(α)
n (z) denote the classical Laguerre
polynomial of degree n. For n ≥ 2 set

ˆL(α)

n (z) := e−z Wr(cid:2)L(α)

n−2(z), L(α)

2 (−z)(cid:3).

By construction, ˆL(α)
3 (z) = 0, and so we obtain a codimension-3 family of polynomials with
degrees n = 2, 4, 5, 6, . . .. These polynomials can also be given using the following form
introduced by Dur´an [56]

of the following bilinear relations:

In this way we recover the codimension 2 exceptional family ﬁrst described in [36, Section
6.2.5]. This example also serves as an illustration of the principle that codimension very
much depends on the choice of gauge. The generic family described above has codimension
3. However, for one particular value of the parameter, the “true” codimension, that is the
codimension of the corresponding reduced family, is actually 2.

The rest of this section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 5.4. We begin with some

supplementary results.

Lemma 5.7. Operator form (30) is gauge-equivalent to the natural form (31). Moreover, if
the operator deﬁned by (30) is exceptional, then so is the gauge-equivalent natural operator.

Proof. Suppose that T admits a bilinear formulation (30). Set

ˆη = µη,

ˆy = µy,

ˆT = µT µ−1.

Observe that

and that

2p(log µ)′′ + p′(log µ)′ =

2pµ′′

ˆη′ = µη′ + µ′η,
ˆη′′ = µη′′ + 2µ′η′ + µ′′η,

with analogous relations for ˆy′, ˆy′′. Rewrite (31) but with ˆy, ˆη in place of y, η, namely

(36)

p(ˆηˆy′′ − 2ˆη′ ˆy′ + ˆη′′ ˆy) +

1
2

p′(ˆη ˆy′ + ˆη′ ˆy) + s(ˆη ˆy′ − ˆη′ ˆy) = λˆy ˆη.

Substituting the preceding deﬁnitions into (36) and dividing by µ2 yields (30), and thereby
establishes that ˆT is a natural operator. Finally, by construction, if yk ∈ P ∗
k are eigenpolyno-
mials of T , then ˆyk+deg µ = µyk are eigenpolynomials of ˆT .
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 5.8. Given a T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) , we deﬁne its Laurent decomposition at a given ζ ∈ C
to be the sum

(37)

Tj,

T = Xj≥dζ

where the Tj are degree-homogeneous operators that map (z − ζ)k to a constant multiple of
(z − ζ)j+k, where

(38)

dζ = min{ordζ p − 2, ordζq − 1, ordζr},

and where p, q, r are the operator coeﬃcients as per (4). Explicitly,

(39)

Tj = pj+2(z − ζ)j+2Dzz + qj+1(z − ζ)j+1Dz + rj(z − ζ)j,

where

p(z) = Xj≥ordζ p

pj(z − ζ)j,

qj(z − ζ)j,

qj ∈ C,

rj(z − ζ)j,

rj ∈ C

are the Laurent decompositions of p, q, r, respectively. We will refer to dζ as the leading order
of the Laurent decomposition of T at ζ.

Lemma 5.9. Given an exceptional T , the leading term, Tdζ , of its Laurent decomposition at
a given ζ ∈ C preserves the space

span{(z − ζ)k : k ∈ Iζ}.

Proof. By Remark 4.14, there exists a basis of U of the form (26). Since U is T invariant and
Tdζ is the smallest order term of T , the desired conclusion follows.

Then, for every natural number j /∈ Iζ, there exists a natural number nj > 0 such that

i) j, j − dζ, . . . , j − (nj − 1)dζ /∈ Iζ;
ii) j − dζnj ∈ Iζ and Tdζ [(z − ζ)j−dζnj ] = 0.

Proof. If j /∈ Iζ then by Lemma 5.9 either j − dζ /∈ Iζ or Tdζ(cid:2)(z − ζ)j−dζ(cid:3) = 0. Iterating this

argument, and using Lemma 4.16 and the fact that the codimension is ﬁnite, we see that the
ﬁrst possibility can happen only a ﬁnite number of times.
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.11. Given an exceptional operator T , for every ζ ∈ C we have dζ ≥ −2.
Proof. Suppose that dζ < −2. For each j ∈ {0, 1, 2}, if j ∈ Iζ then Tdζ [(z − ζ)j] = 0. If j /∈ Iζ,

then by Lemma 5.10 there exists an integer nj > 0 such that Tdζ(cid:2)(z − ζ)j−njdζ(cid:3) = 0. In all

cases, we see that Tdζ would be required to annihilate (z − ζ)k for three diﬀerent integers k,
and since it is a second order operator, this is impossible.
(cid:3)

We are now able to derive some necessary conditions on the coeﬃcients of T .

Lemma 5.12. Given the coeﬃcients p, q, r of an exceptional operator T as per (4), the
following statements hold

(i) p(z) is a polynomial;
(ii) the poles of q(z) are simple;
(iii) deg p ≤ 2, deg q ≤ 1, deg r ≤ 0.

Moreover, if T is reduced, then

(iv) the poles of r(z) are also simple;
(v) every pole of r(z) is also a pole of q(z).

Proof. Consider claim (i). If ζ ∈ C is a pole of p(z), then by (38) we would have dζ ≤ −3
which is forbidden by Lemma 5.11. Hence p(z) must be polynomial. To prove (ii) note that
if ordζ q < −1, then dζ ≤ −3, which is again forbidden by Lemma 5.11.

In order to prove (iii), consider the polynomial division to write the following decomposi-

tions

where qp, rp ∈ P and qs, rs ∈ Q with

q(z) = qp(z) + qs(z),

r(z) = rp(z) + rs(z),

deg qs, deg rs < 0,

deg qp = deg q,

deg rp = deg r.

Next consider the decomposition T = Tp + Ts, where

Tp = p(z)Dzz + qp(z)Dz + rp(z),

Ts = qs(z)Dz + rs(z).

By construction,

deg Ts[y] < deg y,

y ∈ P.

Hence, since T preserves the degree of inﬁnitely many eigenpolynomials, so does Tp. In Section
6 we consider the degree properties of operators with polynomial coeﬃcients. Condition (iii)
follows by Proposition 6.2 of that section.

Next, suppose that T is reduced. If z = ζ is a pole of r(z), then as per (39),

T−2 = p0Dzz + q−1(z − ζ)−1Dz + r−2(z − ζ)−2,
T−1 = p1(z − ζ)Dzz + q0Dz + r−1(z − ζ)−1,

with rj = 0 for j < −2. Since T is reduced, 0 ∈ Iζ. By Lemma 5.9, we have Tdζ [1] = 0, which
means that r−2 = 0. Claim (iv) has been established.

By primitivity, there exists a y = 1 + a(z − ζ) + O((z − ζ)2) ∈ U . Observe that

Hence,

T [y] = (aq−1 + r−1)(z − ζ)−1 + O(1).

r−1 = −aq−1,

which implies that q−1 6= 0. This proves (v).

(cid:3)

Lemma 5.13. Let T be a reduced exceptional operator and ζ ∈ C. If νζ > 0, then the gaps
in the order sequence are the ﬁrst νζ positive odd numbers; i.e.,

(40)

Iζ = {0, 2, 4, . . . , 2νζ} ∪ {2νζ + 1, 2νζ + 2, . . .}.

Moreover, p(ζ) 6= 0, with

(41)

T−2 = p(ζ)(cid:18)Dzz −

2νζ

(z − ζ)

Dz(cid:19) .

Proof. Since νζ > 0 then ζ must be a pole of T . By Lemma 5.12, dζ = −2. By primitivity,
0 ∈ Iζ. We see that 1 /∈ Iζ since otherwise T−2 would need to annihilate 1, (z − ζ) and
(z − ζ)k for some k > 1, which is impossible. By Lemma 5.10, there exists an n ≥ 1 such that
1, 3, 5, . . . , 2n − 1 /∈ Iζ, and

T−2[(z − ζ)2n+1] = 0.

Since T−2 annihilates 1 and (z − ζ)1+2n, it cannot annihilate another monomial, which proves
(40). By Lemma 5.12, (41) must hold with νζ = n.
(cid:3)

We now prove some supplementary results concerning the analytic properties of the series
solutions to the eigenvalue equation T [y] = λy from the point of view of Frobenius’ method,
[73]. For a second-order operator T = p(z)Dzz + q(z)Dz + r(z) we consider power series
solutions of the second-order equation

(42)

centered at a given ζ ∈ C.

y′′ +

p(z)

r(z) − λ

y = 0.

Deﬁnition 5.14. We say that ζ ∈ C is a regular point of the equation T [y] = λy if for every
λ ∈ C, there exist two linearly independent formal series solutions to (42), in the usual sense
of Frobenius’ method. Equivalently,

for all λ ∈ C.

ordζ(cid:18) q

p(cid:19) ≥ −1,

ordζ(cid:18) r − λ

p (cid:19) ≥ −2

Deﬁnition 5.15. We say that T has trivial monodromy at ζ ∈ C if T [y] = λy admits two
linearly independent Laurent series solutions, i.e. if the general solution of (42) is meromorphic
in a neighbourhood of ζ.

Note that if these conditions holds for one λ, then they hold for all λ. The poles of q(z), r(z)
and the zeros of p(z) thus have to be distinguished as points which may not be regular, and
where the monodromy may be non-trivial.

Deﬁnition 5.16. Let T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) be an exceptional operator and p, q, r its coeﬃcients, as
per (4). We say that z = ζ is

i) a primary pole of T if it is a pole of q(z);
ii) a secondary pole of T if it is a zero of p(z);
iii) an ordinary point of T , if it is neither a pole of q(z) nor a zero of p(z).

Proposition 5.17. A point ζ ∈ C cannot be both a primary and a secondary pole. Moreover,
every pole of r(z) is either a primary or a secondary pole.

Proof. If T is reduced, then the ﬁrst assertion follows by Lemma 5.13 and the second by
Lemma 5.12. For general exceptional operators, these assertions follow by Proposition 2.5. (cid:3)

Proposition 5.18. If T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) is an exceptional operator, then every primary pole and
ordinary point is a regular point of the equation T [y] = λy. If p(z) has simple zeros, then
every secondary pole is also a regular point.

Proof. Repeat the argument from the proof of the preceding Proposition.

(cid:3)

Consider the Laurent decomposition given in Deﬁnition 5.8. The indicial equation in Frobe-

nius’ method is determined by the leading term of the operator via the condition

which is equivalent to

Tdζ [(z − ζ)k] = 0,

pdζ +2k(k − 1) + qdζ+1k + rdζ = 0.

Note from Lemma 5.11 that dζ ≥ −2 at all ﬁnite points ζ ∈ C, so primary and secondary
poles are both singular regular points of T .

22

Ma ´ANGELES GARC´IA-FERRERO, DAVID G ´OMEZ-ULLATE, AND ROBERT MILSON

If T is reduced, then at a primary pole, it can be seen from (41) that the two roots of the
indicial equation are 0 and 2νζ + 1. Since they diﬀer by an integer, there is a chance that one
of the solutions has a logarithmic singularity. We show next that this is not the case.

Proposition 5.19. An exceptional operator has trivial monodromy at ordinary points.

Proof. It is well-known that a second-order, linear diﬀerential equation admits two linearly
independent series solutions at an ordinary point.
(cid:3)

Proposition 5.20. An exceptional operator T has trivial monodromy at all primary poles.

Proof. Suppose that T is reduced with trivial monodromy at primary poles. Consider the
general exceptional operator ˜T = σT σ−1, σ ∈ P. The general solution of ˜T [˜y] = λ˜y has the
form ˜y = σy, where y is the general solution of T [y] = λy. Thus, the primary poles of ˜T are
either primary poles or ordinary points of T . By assumption and Proposition 5.19 it follows
the non-reduced operator ˜T also has trivial monodromy at its primary poles.

We therefore assume, without loss of generality, that T is reduced, that z = 0 is a primary
pole of T , and that p(0) = 1. From Lemma 5.11 it follows that the order sequence of T at
z = 0 is

I0 = {0, 2, 4, . . . , 2ν0} ∪ {2ν0 + 1, 2ν0 + 2, . . .},

ν0 > 0,

and that the roots of the indicial equation are 0 and 2ν0 + 1. Hence T [y] = λy admits a unique
holomorphic solution of the form

∞

y = a(z; λ) =

an(λ)zn,

a2ν0+1 = 1.

Xn=2ν0+1

By Frobenius’ method, T [y] = λy admits also a unique series solution of the form

y = b(z; λ) =

bj(λ)zj + c(λ) a(z; λ) log z,

b0 = 1, b2ν0+1 = 0.

∞

Xj=0

Our claim will be proven once we show that c ≡ 0; i.e. that the second independent solution
b(z; λ) does not have a logarithmic singularity.

Observe that

Hence, for 1 ≤ n ≤ 2ν0 we must have

Furthermore, a logarithmic singularity develops if and only if

T−2(cid:2)z2ν0+1 log z(cid:3) = (1 + 2ν0)z2ν0−1,

T−2(cid:2)z2ν0+1(cid:3) = 0.

Proof of Theorem 5.4. Since every exceptional operator is gauge equivalent to an operator in
reduced gauge, it suﬃces to show that every reduced, exceptional operator admits a bilinear
formulation. This is accomplished in Lemma 5.23. Finally, Lemma 5.7 shows that an excep-
tional operator in the reduced gauge is gauge-equivalent to an exceptional operator in the
natural gauge.
(cid:3)

Before moving onto the next section, we make a remark and state two corollaries of Theorem
5.4 that generalize results for exceptional Hermite polynomials previously established in [74].
These results are not used elsewhere in the paper, but they may have some signiﬁcance
for future research, in particular for the derivation of recurrence relations for exceptional
polynomials.

Remark 5.24. Since the roots of the indicial equation at a primary pole and at an ordinary
point are non-negative, the general solution of T [y] = λy is not only meromorphic but holo-
morphic at such points. The only points at which the general solution of T [y] = λy might
not be meromorphic are the secondary poles of T , i.e. the roots of p(z). In the case p(z) = 1
which corresponds to exceptional Hermite operators, the general solution is thus an entire
function, as proved in [75].

Corollary 5.25. Let T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) be an exceptional operator in the natural gauge, and let

η(z) =

(z − ζi)νi,

where νi = νζi are the gap cardinalties at the poles of the operator (see Deﬁnition 4.13 and
Theorem 4.15). Let U ⊂ P be the maximal polynomial subspace. Then y ∈ U if and only if

(55)

is divisible by η.

2pη′y′ −(cid:18)pη′′ +

p′η′ − sη′(cid:19) y

Proof. Let U ′ ⊂ P be the polynomial subspace consisting of those y ∈ P such that (55) is
divisible by η. If y ∈ U , then T [y] ∈ P by Proposition 4.8. Decompose the operator in (32)
as T = T0 + Ts where

Since T0 has polynomial coeﬃcients, Ts[y] ∈ P. Hence, y ∈ U ′, and therefore U ⊂ U ′.

for the range of i, j given above. Hence, U ′ is the joint kernel of the α(j)

By Theorem 4.15, this is also the codimension of U in P. Therefore, U = U ′.

Corollary 5.26. Let T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) be an exceptional operator in the natural gauge. Let U
be the maximal invariant polynomial subspace, and let η be the polynomial deﬁned in (54).
Suppose that f ∈ P is such that f ′ is divisible by η. Then, multiplication by f preserves U ;
i.e., f y ∈ U for every y ∈ U .

Proof. Suppose that f ′ is divisible by η. Replacing y with f y in (55) yields

the traditional multiplication by x is substituted by multiplication by the polynomial f sat-
isfying the above condition, [47, 48, 74, 76].

6. Proof of the Theorem

In this section we prove the previously conjectured result that every exceptional operator
is Darboux connected to a classical operator. We begin with some preliminary deﬁnitions and
results.

Deﬁnition 6.1. For L ∈ Diﬀ(Q) we deﬁne the degree of the operator as

(56)

deg L = max{deg aj − j : j = 0, 1, . . . , ρ},

where the aj ∈ Q is the jth order coeﬃcient as per (2), and where the degree of a rational
function is the diﬀerence of the degrees of the numerator and denominator.

The degree of an operator has an alternative, but equivalent characterization.

Proposition 6.2. The degree of an operator L ∈ Diﬀ(Q) is the smallest integer k such that

(57)

deg L[y] ≤ k + n

for all y ∈ P ∗

n. The above inequality is strict for only ﬁnitely many values of n.

Proof. By the deﬁntion (56), inequality (57) holds for k = deg L. The second claim then
implies that this is the smallest such integer. We therefore turn to the proof of the second
claim. Set k = deg L and let aj ∈ Q, j = 0, 1, . . . , ρ be the coeﬃcients of the operator. By
assumption

aj(z) = cjzj+k + bj(z),

cj ∈ C, bj ∈ Q,

where deg bj ≤ j + k − 1. Write

where

L = L0 + L−,

L0 =

is a homogeneous degree k operator and where

L− =

satisﬁes deg L− < k by construction. Next, observe that

L0[zn] = σ(n)zn+k,

where

σ(n) =

ρ

Xj=0

cjn(n − 1) · · · (n − j + 1).

Since σ(n) is a polynomial of degree ≤ ρ, we have σ(n) = 0 for at most ρ values of n. By
construction, for y ∈ Pn, we have

Therefore, if σ(n) 6= 0, then

deg L−[y] < k + n.

deg L[y] = k + n.

Deﬁnition 6.3. We say that T ∈ Diﬀ 2(P) is a Bochner operator (or classical operator) if
deg T = 0.

(cid:3)

Before stating the main result of this section, we note the following.

Proposition 6.4. Every Bochner operator is exceptional.

Proof. By the proof of Proposition 6.2,

T [zk] = σ(k)zk + lower degree terms

where σ(k) is a non-zero polynomial of degree ≤ 2. Hence, T − σ(k) maps Pk into Pk−1 for
every k ∈ N. By the rank-nullity theorem, this linear map has a non-trivial kernel, which
means that, for every k ∈ N, there exists a yk ∈ Pk such that

T [yk] = σ(k)yk.

However deg yk may be strictly less than k, which means that yk may coincide with an
eigenpolynomial of lower degree. However, this can happen only if σ(k) = σ(k′) for some
k′ 6= k; i.e. if the eigenvalue is not simple. Since σ(k) is at most a quadratic function, and k is
a positive integer, this can happen at most ﬁnitely many times. Therefore, a co-ﬁnite number
of eigenvalues σ(k) are simple, which means that there are eigenpolynomials for a co-ﬁnite
number of degrees k. Therefore, T is an exceptional operator according to Deﬁnition 4.1. (cid:3)

Remark 6.5. Note that Bochner operators need not have polynomial eigenfunctions for every
degree k ∈ N. See for example Remark 4.10 and a counter-example in Example 4.11.

The main result of this section is the following theorem.

Theorem 6.6. Every exceptional operator T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) is Darboux connected to a Bochner
operator TB ∈ Diﬀ 2(P). Moreover, letting p ∈ P2 denote the second-order coeﬃcient of T ,
and letting W, WB denote the respective weights, as deﬁned by (5b), we have

(58)

W (z) = WB(z)

where η ∈ P is a polynomial whose roots belong to the set of primary poles of T , and where
χ ∈ Q is a rational function such that

(59)

is a constant.

p(z)

χ′(z)
χ(z)

The proof of Theorem 6.6 requires a number of preliminary results. Let T ∈ Diﬀ 2(Q) be an
exceptional operator and consider the vector space

L := {L ∈ Diﬀ(P) : T kL ∈ Diﬀ(P) for all k ∈ N}.

The following is an equivalent characterization of L.

Lemma 6.7. For L ∈ Diﬀ(P), we have L ∈ L if and only if L[P] ⊂ U .

Proof. One direction is trivial; we prove the converse. Suppose that L ∈ L so that we have

T k(cid:2)L[y](cid:3) ∈ P for all y ∈ P and all k ≥ 1. By Deﬁntion 4.7, this implies that L[y] ∈ U , as was

to be shown.

(cid:3)

Next, deﬁne the subspace

L(ρ) := {L ∈ L : ord L ≤ ρ, deg L ≤ 0}

where it is clear that L(ρ1) ⊂ L(ρ2) for ρ1 < ρ2. We will ﬁrst show that at least one L(ρ) is
non-trivial.

Lemma 6.8. Let ζ1, . . . , ζN be the primary poles of T , and ν1, . . . , νN the corresponding gap
cardinalities. Then, dim L(n) > 0 where

Proof. Set

(60)

By construction, for every y ∈ P

i = 1, . . . , N, k /∈ Iζi,

where α(k)

y ∈ P, and Lemma 6.7 implies that the diﬀerential operator

are the linear functionals deﬁned in (28). Hence, by Lemma 4.19, ηy ∈ U for all

belongs to L. By Proposition 4.15 its degree is zero, so L ∈ L(n) as was to be proved.

(cid:3)

L = η(z)Dn
z ,

31

Now, let ρmin be the minimum positive integer such that dim L(ρ) > 0, i.e. dim L(ρmin) > 0

but dim L(ρ) = 0 for all ρ < ρmin.
Lemma 6.9. For all non-zero L ∈ L(ρmin) we have ord L = ρmin and deg L = 0 exactly.

Proof. The order equality holds by the minimality assumption on ρmin. Similarly, suppose
that there exists a non-zero L ∈ L(ρmin) such that deg L = −d < 0. Since L has polynomial
coeﬃcients, such an operator would necessarily be of the form L = ˜LDd, where ˜L ∈ Diﬀ(P).
This would imply that ˜L ∈ L(ρmin−d), which would again contradict the minimality assumption
for ρmin.
(cid:3)
Lemma 6.10. dim L(ρmin) ≤ ρmin + 1.

Proof. Observe that ρmin + 1 is the dimension of the space of degree homogeneous diﬀerential
operators of order ρmin. Hence if dim L(ρmin) were to exceed this bound, we would be able
to construct an operator L ∈ L(ρmin) having strictly negative degree, which is impossible by
Lemma 6.9.
(cid:3)

Lemma 6.11. Let T be an exceptional operator. Then, there exist a decomposition

T = T0 + Ts,

where T0 ∈ Diﬀ 2(P) is a Bochner operator, and Ts ∈ Diﬀ 1(Q) has negative degree.

Proof. Let p, q, r be the coeﬃcients of T , as per (4). By Lemma 5.12, we must have p ∈ P2,
and polynomial division allows to write

with q1, r0 ∈ P, qs, rs ∈ Q, with

q = q1 + qs,

r = r0 + rs,

deg q1 ≤ 1,

deg r0 = 0,

deg qs ≤ 0,

deg rs ≤ −1.

Taking

T0 = pDzz + q1Dz + r0,

Ts = qsDz + rs

gives the desired decomposition.

(cid:3)

Lemma 6.12. Let T be an exceptional operator and T0, Ts its decomposition into Bochner
and singular part according to Lemma 6.11 . If L ∈ L(ρmin) is non-zero, then

(61)

deg (T L − LT0) < 0.

Proof. By Lemma 6.9, deg L = 0. Hence, for y ∈ P ∗

n we have

(62)
(63)
(64)

T [y] = σ1(n) y + y1,
T0[y] = σ1(n) y + y2,
L[y] = σ2(n) y + y3,

deg y1 < n,
deg y2 < n,
deg y3 < n,

where by Proposition 6.2, σ1(n), σ2(n) are polynomials in n. Hence,

(65)
(66)

(T L)[y] = T [σ2(n) y + y3] = σ1(n)σ2(n)y + y4,
(LT0) [y] = L[σ1(n) y + y2] = σ2(n)σ1(n)y + y5,

deg y4 < n
deg y5 < n,

which establishes (61).

(cid:3)

32

Ma ´ANGELES GARC´IA-FERRERO, DAVID G ´OMEZ-ULLATE, AND ROBERT MILSON

Lemma 6.13. Let T be an exceptional operator and T0, Ts its decomposition according to
Lemma 6.11. Then, there exists a linear transformation A : L(ρmin) → L(ρmin) such that

A(L)D = T L − LT0, L ∈ L(ρmin).

Proof. Since T is second-order,

ord(T L − LT ) ≤ ord L + 1, L ∈ Diﬀ(P).

By construction, T − T0 is a ﬁrst-order operator, and hence

ord(T L − LT0) ≤ ord L + 1, L ∈ Diﬀ(P)

also. By Lemma 6.12, if L ∈ L(ρmin), then

T L − LT0 = ˜LD

for some unique operator ˜L ∈ Diﬀ(P). By construction, ( ˜LD)[P] ⊂ U which means that that
˜L[P] ⊂ U as well. Hence, Lemma 6.7 implies that ˜L ∈ L. If L ∈ L(ρmin) then by the above
results we see that ord ˜L ≤ ord L = ρmin and deg ˜L ≤ 0. This implies that ˜L ∈ L(ρmin). Our
claim is established once we set A(L) := ˜L.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 6.6. Let T, T0 be as in the preceding Lemma. By Lemma 6.10, L(ρmin) is
ﬁnite dimensional. Hence, there exists an eigenvector L ∈ L(ρmin) with eigenvalue γ of the
linear transformation A deﬁned in Lemma 6.13. This means that L ∈ Diﬀ(P) and A(L) = γL
so that

T L = L(T0 + γD).

Therefore TB = T0 + γD is the desired Bochner operator.

By Theorem 5.4 and Lemma 5.7, the eigenvalue relation T [y] = λy is equivalent to (30),

where η has zeros at the primary poles of T . Hence,

where a, b are constants. Let WB(z) be the weight associated to TB. By deﬁnition of T0,

where c is also a constant. By Proposition 3.6, W (z) is WB(z) times a rational factor, which
implies that

p(x)

W (z) = exp(cid:18)Z z ax + b
WB(z) = exp(cid:18)Z z ax + c

dx(cid:19) η(z)−2,
dx(cid:19) ,

p(x)

χ(z) = η(z)2 W (z)
WB(z)

= exp(cid:18)Z z b − c

p(x)

dx(cid:19)

is a rational function. The desired conclusion follows immediately.

7. Exceptional Orthogonal Polynomial Systems

In all of the previous sections the diﬀerential operator T was treated at a purely formal level,
the emphasis being on the algebraic conditions leading to the existence of an inﬁnite number
of polynomial eigenfunctions. In this section, analytic conditions will be further imposed, in
order to select those operators that have a self-adjoint action on a suitably deﬁned Hilbert
space. This observation motivates the following.
Deﬁnition 7.1. We say that a co-ﬁnite, real-valued polynomial sequence yk ∈ RP ∗
{k1, . . . , km} forms a Sturm-Liouville orthogonal polynomial system (SL-OPS) provided

k , k /∈

(i) the yk are the eigenpolynomials of an operator T ∈ Diﬀ 2(RQ) ,
(ii) there is an open interval I ⊂ R such that

(ii-a) the associated weight function W (z), as deﬁned by (5b), is single valued, and

integrable on I, and moreover,

(ii-b) all moments are ﬁnite, i.e.

33

zjW (z)dz < ∞,

j ∈ N;

ZI

(ii-c) y(z)p(z)W (z) → 0 at the endpoints of I for every polynomial y ∈ P .

(iii) the vector space span{yk : k /∈ {k1, . . . , km}} is dense in the weighted Hilbert space

L2(W (z)dz, I).

Assumption (i) means that T is an exceptional operator. By Proposition 2.5 and Theorem
5.4, no generality is lost if we assume that T is in the natural gauge; i.e., the eigenvalue
relation takes the form (31), where η is given by (54).

Proposition 2.2 and (ii-c) ensures that T is polinomially regular and that yk are orthogonal

W (z)yi(z)yj(z)dz = ciδij,

i, j /∈ {k1, . . . , km},

ci > 0.

ZI

As it was already mentioned in Remark 4.10, regularity implies semi-simplicity, which means
that U , the maximal invariant polynomial subspace, coincides with the span of the eigen-
polynomials yk, k /∈ {k1, . . . , km}, and ν = m. Therefore, by assumption (iii), operator T is
essentially self-adjoint on U .

It has already been noted in all examples of exceptional orthogonal polynomials published
in the literature, that the orthogonality weight for the exceptional OPS is a classical weight
multiplied by a rational function. This can now be considered as a result.

Proposition 7.2. The orthogonality weight W (z) of a SL-OPS has the form

(67)

where

W (z) =

WB(z)
η(z)2

WB(z) = exp(cid:18)Z z ax + b

p(x)

dx(cid:19) ,

is the weight of a classical OPS, and where η ∈ RP ∗
m.

p ∈ RP2, a, b ∈ R

Proof. Expression (67) follows by (32) and (5b). The condition on η is ensured by its deﬁnition
(54), Theorem 4.15 and the fact already mentioned that ν = m.
(cid:3)

Notice that η has zeros at the primary poles, which lie outside I by assumption (ii).

Remark 7.3. If an SL-OPS has polynomial eigenfunctions for all degrees, i.e. m = 0 in
Deﬁnition 7.1, then it deﬁnes a classical orthogonal polynomial system, which up to an aﬃne
transformation must be Hermite, Laguerre or Jacobi [3, 4]. Otherwise we have a genuinely
exceptional orthogonal polynomial system whose operator T has one or more primary poles.

Since every SL-OPS has an associated exceptional operator T , the notion of Darboux

connectedness for operators can be naturally extended to SL-OPS.

Deﬁnition 7.4. We say that two SL-OPS are Darboux connected if their associated excep-
tional operators are Darboux connected as per Deﬁnition 3.7.

34

Ma ´ANGELES GARC´IA-FERRERO, DAVID G ´OMEZ-ULLATE, AND ROBERT MILSON

The weights associated with a SL-OPS fall into the same three broad categories as do

classical orthogonal polynomials.

Deﬁnition 7.5. We say that a SL-OPS is of, respectively, Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi
type if the corresponding interval I = (a, b) and weight W (z), z ∈ I have the form

(68a)

I = (−∞, ∞),

(68b)

I = (0, ∞)

(68c)

I = (−1, 1)

WH(z) =

WL(z) =

WJ(z) =

e−z2
η(z)2 ,
zαe−z
η(z)2 , α > −1,
(1 − z)α(1 + z)β

η(z)2

, α, β > −1,

where η ∈ RP is a real-valued polynomial which is non-vanishing on I.

Proposition 7.6. Up to an aﬃne transformation of the independent variable, every SL-OPS
belongs to one of the three types shown above.

Proof. Up to an aﬃne change of variable, the second-order coeﬃcient of an exceptional oper-
ator takes one of the following forms:

1, z, z2, 1 + z2, 1 − z2.

Applying (5b) and (32), we see that cases 1,2, and 5 correspond to weights of Hermite,
Laguerre, and Jacobi type, respectively. It therefore suﬃces to rule out the remaining possi-
bilities. These correspond to, respectively, weights of the following form:

W (z) =

W (z) =

b
z

zae
η(z)2 ,
ea arctan(z)(1 + z2)b

η(z)2

,

where a, b ∈ R are real constants. By inspection, there does not exist a choice of constants or
an interval I ⊂ R such that of these forms can satisfy requirement (ii) in the deﬁnition of a
SL-OPS.
(cid:3)

The analysis of the regularity of the exceptional weight amounts to studying the range of
parameters and the combination of Darboux transformations such that η(z) has no zeros on I,
and such that the classical portion of the weight is integrable on I. For the case of exceptional
Hermite polynomials, this was done in [59,75], for exceptional Laguerre polynomials in [56,62],
and for exceptional Jacobi polynomials in [77].

Applying (31) with p(z) = 1, z, 1 − z2, respectively, we arrive at the following bilinear

relations for the exceptional polynomials associated to the above 3 classes of SL-OPS:

(69)

(70)

(71)

k − 2η′H ′
(ηH ′′
k − 2η′L′
z(ηL′′
(1 − z2)(ηP ′′

k + η′′Hk) − 2z(ηH ′
k + η′′Lk) + (1 + α − z)ηL′

k − η′Hk) + 2k ηHk = 0

k + (z − α)η′Lk + (k − m) ηLk = 0,

k − 2η′P ′

k + η′′Pk) + (−(2 + α + β)z + β − α)ηP ′

k+

+ ((α + β)z − β + α)η′Pk + ((α + β)(n − m) + (n − 2m + 1)n) ηPk = 0,

35

Here, Hk(z), Lk(z), Pk(z) denote, respectively, exceptional Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi
polynomials of degree k corresponding to a particular choice of η(z) ∈ P ∗
m, and valid for all
k /∈ {k1, . . . , km}. Setting m = 0 in the above equations recovers the usual Hermite, Laguerre,
and Jacobi diﬀerential equations. It therefore makes sense to regard (69) (70) and (71) as the
exceptional generalizations of these 3 classical equations.

We are now ready to give the proof of the main theorem.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let T ∈ R Diﬀ(Q) be the exceptional operator associated with a SL-
OPS. By Theorem 6.6, T is Darboux connected to a Bochner operator TB with the corre-
sponding weights related by (58). Since p ∈ RP2 is the same for both operators, both the W
and WB belong to the same class of weights. In Proposition 7.2, we established that the poly-
nomial η(z) is real-valued. Hence, the rational factor χ(z) in (58) must also be real-valued,
by (59). Hence, TB has real coeﬃcients.

It remains to show that the weight parameters in WB satisfy the conditions in (68), so that
the resulting measure has ﬁnite moments. We do not claim that TB is regular, but rather
that, TB is Darboux connected to another Bochner operator that is regular.

For the Hermite class, there is nothing to prove, because p(z) = 1, and hence χ(z) in (58)

must be a constant.

Let us consider the Laguerre class next. Write

Tα = zDzz + (1 + α − z)Dz = (zDz + 1 + α − z) ◦ Dz.

The corresponding weight is zαe−z. Performing a Darboux transformation gives

Tα 7→ Dz ◦ (zDz + 1 + α − z) = Tα+1 − 1.

Therefore, Tα is Darboux connected to Tα+1 − 1, and more generally to Tα+n − n, where n
is an arbitrary integer. Hence, even though the TB produced by Theorem 6.6 may not be
regular, it is Darboux connected to a regular Bochner operator, and hence so is T .

Finally, let us consider the Jacobi class. Write

Tα,β = (1 − z2)Dzz + (−(2 + α + β)z + β − α)Dz =(cid:0)(1 − z2)Dz − (2 + α + β)z + β − α(cid:1) ◦ Dz.

Performing a Darboux transformation gives

Tα,β 7→ Dz ◦(cid:0)(1 − z2)Dz − (2 + α + β)z + β − α(cid:1) = Tα+1,β+1 − 2 − α − β.

Therefore, Tα,β is Darboux connected to Tα+n,β+n − (2 + α + β)n for every integer n. By
taking n suﬃciently large, we can ensure that Tα+n,β+n is regular.
