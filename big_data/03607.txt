Enhanced Raman scattering can be obtained by injecting a seeded light ﬁeld which is correlated
with the initially prepared collective atomic excitation. This Raman ampliﬁcation process can be
used to realize atom-light hybrid interferometer. We numerically calculate the phase sensitivities
and the signal-to-noise ratios of this interferometer with the method of homodyne detection and
intensity detection, and give their diﬀerences between this two methods. In the presence of loss of
light ﬁeld and atomic decoherence the measure precision will be reduced which can be explained by
the break of the intermode decorrelation conditions of output modes.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum parameter estimation is the use of quan-
tum techniques to improve measurement precision than
purely classical approaches, which has been received a
lot of attention in recent years [1–11].
Interferome-
ters can provide the most precise measurements. Re-
cently, physicists with the advanced Laser Interferom-
eter Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) observed
the gravitational waves [12]. The Mach–Zehnder interfer-
ometer (MZI) and its variants have been used as a generic
model to realize precise measurement of phase. In order
to avoid the vacuum ﬂuctuations enter the unused port
and are ampliﬁed in the interferometer by the coherent
light, Caves [3] suggested to replace the vacuum ﬂuctua-
tions with the squeezed-vacuum light to reach a sub-shot-
noise sensitivity. Xiao et al. [13] and Grangier et al. [14]
have demonstrated the experimental results beyond the
standard quantum limit (SQL) δϕ = 1/√N with N num-
ber of photons or other bosons. Due to overcoming the
SQL and reaching the Heisenberg limit (HL) δϕ = 1/N ,
it will lead to potential applications in high resolution
measurements. Therefore, many theoretical proposals
and experimental techniques are developed to improve
the sensitivity [15–17]. When the probe states made of
correlated states, such as the NOON states of the form

(|Nia|0ib + eiφN|0ia|Nib)/√2, the HL in the phase-shift

measurements can reach [18, 19]. But, high-N NOON
states is very hard to synthesize. In the presence of real-
istic imperfections and noise, the ultimate precision limit
in noisy quantum-enhanced metrology was also studied
[20–27].

However, most of the current atomic and optical in-
terferometers are made of linear devices such as beam
splitters and phase shifters. In 1986, Yurke et al. [28] in-

∗Electronic address: chyuan@phy.ecnu.edu.cn
†Electronic address: lqchen@phy.ecnu.edu.cn

troduced a new interferometer where two nonlinear beam
splitters take the place of two linear beam splitters (BSs)
in the traditional MZI. It is also called the SU(1,1) inter-
ferometer because it is described by the SU(1,1) group, as
opposed to SU(2) for BSs. The detailed quantum statis-
tics of the two-mode SU(1,1) interferometer was stud-
ied by Leonhardt [29]. SU(1,1) phase states also have
been studied theoretically in quantum measurements for
phase-shift estimation [30, 31]. An improved theoreti-
cal scheme of the SU(1,1) optical interferometer was pre-
sented by Plick et al [32] who proposed to inject a strong
coherent beam to “boost” the photon number. Exper-
imental realization of this SU(1,1) optical interferome-
ter was reported by diﬀerent groups [33, 34]. The noise
performance of this interferometer was analyzed [11, 35]
and under the same phase-sensing intensity condition the
improvement of 4.1 dB in signal-to-noise ratio was ob-
served [36]. By contrast, SU(1,1) atomic interferometer
also has been experimentally realized with Bose-Einstein
Condensates [37–40]. Gabbrielli et al. [40] realized a non-
linear three-mode SU(1,1) atomic interferometer, where
the analogy of optical down conversion, the basic ingre-
dient of SU(1,1) interferometry, is created with ultracold
atoms.

Collective atomic excitation due to its potential appli-
cations for quantum information processing has attracted
a great deal of interest [41–43]. Collective atomic ex-
citation can be realized by the Raman scattering.
Ini-
tially prepared collective atomic excitation can be used
to enhance the second Raman scattering [44–46]. Sub-
sequently, we proposed another scheme to enhance the
Raman scattering using the correlation-enhanced mech-
anism [47]. That is, by injecting a seeded light ﬁeld
which is correlated with the initially prepared collec-
tive atomic excitation, the Raman scattering can be en-
hanced greatly, which was also realized in experiment
recently [48]. Such a photon-atom interface can form
an SU(1,1)-typed atom-light hybrid interferometer [49],
where the atomic Raman ampliﬁcation processes replac-
ing the beam splitting elements in a traditional MZI

[28]. Diﬀerent from all-optical or all-atomic interferom-
eters, the atom-light hybrid interferometers depend on
both atomic and optical phases so that we can probe the
atomic phases with optical interferometric techniques.
The atomic phase can be adjusted by magnetic ﬁeld or
Stark shifts. The atom-light hybrid interferometer is
composed of two Raman ampliﬁcation processes. The
ﬁrst nonlinear process generates the correlated optical
and atomic waves in the two arms and they are decorre-
lated by the second nonlinear process.

In this paper, we calculate the phase sensitivities and
the SNRs using the homodyne detection and the intensity
detection. The diﬀerences between the phase sensitivities
and the SNRs are compared. The loss of light ﬁeld and
atomic decoherence will degrade the measure precision.
The eﬀects of the light ﬁeld loss and atomic decoherence
on measure precision can be explained from the break of
intermode decorrelation conditions.

Our article is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we give
the model of the hybrid atom-light interferometer, and
in Sec. III we numerically calculate the phase sensitivity
and the SNR, and analyze and compare the conditions
to obtain the optimal phase sensitivity and the maximal
SNR. In Sec.
IV, the LCCs of the amplitude quadra-
ture and number operator are derived from the light-
atom coupling equations in the presence of light ﬁeld
loss and atomic decoherence. The LCCs as a function
of the transmission rate and the collisional rate are cal-
culated and analyzed. The loss of light ﬁeld and atomic
decoherence will degrade the measure precision, which
is explained from the intermode decorrelation conditions
break. Finally, in Sec. V we conclude with a summary
of our results.

II. THE MODEL OF ATOM-LIGHT HYBRID

INTERFEROMETER

In this section, we review the diﬀerent processes of the
atom-light interferometer [49, 50] as shown in Fig. 1(a)-
(c), where two Raman systems replaced the BSs in
the traditional MZI. Considering a three-level Lambda-
shaped atom system as shown in Fig. 1(d), the Raman
scattering process is described by the following pair of
coupled equations [51]:

∂ˆa(t)

∂t

= ηAP ˆb†(t),

∂ˆb(t)
∂t

= ηAP ˆa†(t),

(1)

where η is the coupling constant, and AP is the amplitude
of the pump ﬁeld. The solution of above equation is

ˆa(t) = u(t)ˆa(0) + v(t)ˆb†(0), ˆb(t) = u(t)ˆb(0) + v(t)ˆa†(0),
(2)
where u(t) = cosh(g), v(t) = eiθ sinh(g), g = |ηAP| t,
eiθ = (AP /A∗
P )1/2, and t is the time duration of pump
ﬁeld EP . We use diﬀerent subscripts to diﬀerentiate the
two processes, where 1 denotes the ﬁrst Raman process
(RP1) and 2 denotes the second Raman process (RP2).

FIG. 1: (Color online) (a) The intermode correlation between
the Stokes ﬁeld ˆa1 and the atomic excitation ˆb1 is generated
by spontaneous Raman process. ˆa0 is the initial input light
ﬁeld. ˆb0 is in vacuum or an initial atomic collective excitation
which can be prepared by another Raman process or electro-
magnetically induced transparency process. (b) During the
delay time τ , the Stokes ﬁeld ˆa1 will be subject to the pho-
1 and the collective excitation ˆb1 will
ton loss and evolute to ˆa′
undergo the collisional dephasing to ˆb′
1. A ﬁctitious beam
splitter (BS) is introduced to mimic the loss of photons into
the environment. ˆV is the vacuum. (c) After the delay time
τ , the light ﬁeld ˆa′
1 are
used as initial seeding for another enhanced Raman process.
(d)-(f) The corresponding energy-level diagrams of diﬀerent
processes are shown.

1 and its correlated atomic excitation ˆb′

t1 and t2 are the durations of the pump ﬁeld EP 1 and
EP 2, respectively.

After the ﬁrst Raman process of the interferometer, the
Stokes ﬁeld ˆa1 and the atomic excitation ˆb1 are generated
as shown in Fig. 1(a). Then after a small delay time τ , the
second Raman process of the interferometer takes place
which is used as beams combination as shown in Fig. 1(c).
During the small delay time τ shown in Fig. 1(b), the
Stokes ﬁeld ˆa1 will be subject to the photon loss and
evolute to ˆa′
1 . A ﬁctitious BS is introduced to mimic the
loss of photons into the environment, then the light ﬁeld
ˆa′
1 is given by

1 = √T ˆa1(t1)eiφ + √R ˆV ,
ˆa′

(3)

where T and R are the transmission and reﬂectance co-
eﬃcients with T + R = 1, and ˆV is in vacuum. The
collective excitation ˆb1 will also undergo the collisional
dephasing described by the factor e−Γτ , then ˆb′

1 is

ˆb′
1 = ˆb1(t1)e−Γτ + ˆF ,

(4)

where ˆF =R τ
0 e−Γ(τ −t′) ˆf (t′)dt′, and ˆf (t) is the quantum
statistical Langevin operator describing the collision-
induced ﬂuctuation, and obeys h ˆf (t) ˆf †(t′)i = 2Γδ(t − t′)
and h ˆf †(t) ˆf (t′)i = 0. Then h ˆF ˆF †i = 1−e−2Γτ guarantees
the consistency of the operator properties of ˆb′
1.

Using Eqs. (2)-(4), the generated Stokes ﬁeld ˆa2 and

collective atomic excitation ˆb2 can be worked out:
1(0) + √Ru2 ˆV + v2 ˆF †,

ˆa2(t2) = U1ˆa1(0) + V1ˆb†
ˆb2(t2) = e−iφ[U2ˆb1(0) + V2ˆa†

1(0)] + √Rv2 ˆV † + u2 ˆF ,

(5)

(6)

where

U1 = √T u1u2eiφ + e−Γτ v∗

1v2, V1 = √T v1u2eiφ

+ e−Γτ u∗
+ √T v∗

1v2, U2 = e−Γτ u1u2eiφ
1 v2, V2 = e−Γτ v1u2eiφ + √T u∗

1v2.

Next, we use the above results to calculate the phase
sensitivity and the SNR, and analyze and compare the
conditions to obtain optimal phase sensitivity and the
maximal SNR.

FIG. 2: (Color online) The phase sensitivity ∆φHD and the
SNRHD versus the phase shift φ using the method of homo-
dyne detection with (a) θα = π/2; (b) θα = 0. Parameters:
g = 2, |α| = 10.

Phase can be estimated but cannot be measured be-
cause there is not a Hermitian operator corresponding to
a quantum phase [52]. In phase precision measurement,

3

the estimation of a phase shift can be done by choosing
an observable, and the the relationship between the ob-
servable and the phase is known. The mean-square error
in parameter φ is then given by the error propagation
formula [18]:

∆φ = h(∆ ˆO)2i1/2

,

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∂h ˆOi/∂φ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

h ˆOi

h(∆ ˆO)2i1/2

where ˆO is the measurable operator and h(∆ ˆO)2i =
h ˆO2i − h ˆOi2. The precision of the phase shift measure-
ment is not the only parameter of concern. We also need
consider the SNR [11, 53, 54], which is given by

SNR =

.

(9)

In current optical measurement of phase sensitivity,
the homodyne detection [54–56] and the intensity detec-
tion [32, 35] are often used. That is, the observables are
the amplitude quadrature operator ˆxa2 = (ˆa2 + ˆa†
2)/2
and the number operator ˆna2 = ˆa†
2ˆa2. For the balanced
situation that is g1 = g2 = g, and θ2 − θ1 = π. Firstly,
we do not consider the eﬀect of loss on the generated
Stokes ﬁeld ˆa2 and atomic collective excitation ˆb2. That
is, R = 0 and Γτ = 0, it reduced to the ideal lossless case
and we have U1 = U2 = U = [cosh2 geiφ − sinh2 g], V1 =
V2 = V = 1

2 sinh 2g[eiφ − 1]eiθ1, where |U|2 − |V|2 = 1.

A. Homodyne detection

For a coherent light |αi (α = |α| eiθα, Nα = |α|2) as
the phase-sensing ﬁeld, using the amplitude quadrature
operator ˆxa2 as the detected variable the phase sensitivity
and the SNR are given by

∆φHD =

SNRHD =

h(∆ˆxa2)2i1/2

,

√Nα cosh2 g |sin(φ + θα)|
√Nα[cosh2 g cos(φ + θα) − sinh2 g cos(θα)]
h(∆ˆxa2)2i1/2

,

(10)

with

h(∆ˆxa2)2i =

1

4(cid:2)cosh2(2g) − sinh2(2g) cos φ(cid:3) ,

where the subscript HD denotes the homodyne detection.
The phase sensitivity ∆φHD and the SNRHD depend on
φ and θα, when g and α take a certain values. From Eqs.
(10) and (11), both the ∆φHD and the SNRHD need that
the term h(∆ˆxa2)2i is minimal, which can be realized at
φ = 0 and h(∆ˆxa2)2i = 1/4 [57].
When φ = 0 and θα = π/2, we obtain the optimal
phase sensitivity and the worst SNR:

But when φ = 0 and θα = 0 or π, the maximal SNRHD
is given by

SNRHD = 2pNα,

(15)

and the sensitivity ∆φHD is divergent. The phase sensi-
tivity ∆φHD and the SNRHD of above two diﬀerent cases
are shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. We ﬁnd
that at the optimal point φ = 0 and θα = π/2 the sen-
sitivity is high (i.e. ∆φ small) and can beat the SQL
but the SNRHD is low. At the optimal point φ = 0 and
θα = 0 the SNRHD is high, but the sensitivity is low.
Ideally, of course, we would like high sensitivity ∆φHD
and high SNRHD at the same optimal point.

Diﬀerent from the homodyne detection, the phase sen-
sitivity ∆φID and the SNRID only depend on φ for given
g and Nα. Under the condition of g = 2 and Nα = √10,
the phase sensitivity ∆φID and the SNRID as a function
of phase shift φ are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respec-
tively. The best phase sensitivity ∆φID and the maximal

SNRID (= √Nα) are obtained at φ ≈ 0.062 and φ = 0,
respectively. In Fig. 3(a) at φ ≈ 0 the slope |∂hˆna2i/∂φ|
is very small, as well in Fig. 3(b) at φ = 0 the intensity
of the signal hˆna2i is low, but the noise is also low. It
demonstrated that the noise h(∆ˆna2)2i plays a dominant
role. The best phase sensitivity from the intensity detec-
tion is lower than it from the homodyne detection, i.e.,
∆φID > ∆φHD. The relation of maximal SNR from two
detection methods is SNRHD = 2SNRID.

The phase sensitivities ∆φ as a function of the phase-
sensing probe number nph is shown in Fig. 4. The thick
solid line is the SQL. The thin solid line and dotted line
are sensitivities ∆φHD from homodyne detection with
and without losses cases, respectively. As well the dashed
and dash-dotted lines are sensitivities ∆φID from inten-
sity detection with and without losses cases, respectively.
From Fig. 4, it is easy to see that the best phase sensitiv-
ities ∆φID are larger than ∆φHD under the same condi-
tion. In the presence of the loss and collisional dephasing
(T = 0.8, Γτ = 0.1), the phase sensitivities ∆φHD and
∆φID can beat the SQL under the balanced situation,
which is very important for phase sensitivity measure-
ment.

Next section, we explain the reason that the eﬀects of
the light ﬁeld loss and atomic decoherence on measure
precision can be explained from the break of intermode
decorrelation conditions.

In this section, we use the above results to calculate
the intermode correlations of the diﬀerent Raman am-
pliﬁcation processes of the atom-light interferometer as
shown in Fig. 1(a)-(c) [49]. We also study the eﬀects of
the loss of light ﬁeld and the dephasing of atomic exci-
tation on the correlation. The intermode correlation of
light and atomic collective excitation can be described by
the linear correlation coeﬃcient (LCC), which is deﬁned
as [58]

J( ˆA, ˆB) =

cov( ˆA, ˆB)

h(∆ ˆA)2i1/2h(∆ ˆB)2i1/2

,

(24)

where cov( ˆA, ˆB) = (h ˆA ˆBi + h ˆB ˆAi)/2 − h ˆAih ˆBi is the
covariance of two-mode ﬁeld and h(∆ ˆA)2i = h ˆA2i−h ˆAi2,
h(∆ ˆB)2i = h ˆB2i − h ˆBi2.
The respective quadrature operators of the light and
atomic excitation are ˆxa = (ˆa + ˆa†)/2, ˆya = (ˆa − ˆa†)/2i,
ˆxb = (ˆb + ˆb†)/2, and ˆyb = (ˆb − ˆb†)/2i. After the ﬁrst
Raman scattering process, the intermode correlations be-
tween the light ﬁeld mode and the atomic mode are gen-
erated. We start by injecting a coherent state |αi in mode
ˆa, and a vacuum state in mode ˆb, the LCC of quadratures
are given by

Jx1(ˆxa1, ˆxb1) = cos θ1 tanh(2g1),
Jy1(ˆya1, ˆyb1) = − cos θ1 tanh(2g1),

and the LCC of number operators ˆna1 [= ˆa†(t1)ˆa(t1)] and
ˆnb1 [= ˆb†(t1)ˆb(t1)] is given by

Jn1(ˆna1, ˆnb1) =

(1 + 2 |α|2)

[4 coth2(2g1)(|α|2 + |α|4) + 1]1/2

. (27)

From Eqs. (25)-(27), the quadrature correlation LCCs
Jx1(ˆxa1, ˆxb1) and Jy1(ˆya1, ˆyb1) are independent on the
input coherent state which is diﬀerent from the num-
ber correlation LCC Jn1(ˆna1, ˆnb1). Under θ1 6= π/2, the
LCCs Jx1 and Jy1 are opposite and not zero, which shows
the correlation exists. Due to their opposite intermode
correlations, the squeezing of quantum ﬂuctuations is in
a superposition of the two-modes, i.e., ˆX = (ˆxa + ˆxb)/√2,
ˆY = (ˆya + ˆyb)/√2 and [ ˆX, ˆY ] = i/2 [58].

From Eq. (27) the number correlation LCC Jn1 is al-
ways positive so long as g 6= 0. If α = 0, that is vacuum
state input, then Jn1(ˆna1, ˆnb1) = 1, this maximal value
shows the strong intermode correlation and such states
in optical ﬁelds are often called ”twin beams”. For this
vacuum state input case, the state of atomic mode and
light mode is similar to the two-mode squeezed vacuum
state.

noise is dominant in realizing the optimal sensitivity and
the maximal SNR. At this point (φ = 0), we can obtain
the maximal SNRID. However, the slope |∂hˆna2i/∂φ| is
equal to 0 at this decorrelation point as shown in Fig.
3(a). In Fig. 3(b) at nearby the decorrelation point, the
noise is amplifed a little and the optimal phase sensitiv-
ity ∆φID is obtained. With the decrease of the trans-
mission rate T or the increase of Γτ , the LCC Jn2 are
reduced at ﬁrst, then revive quickly, and ﬁnally increase
to 1 as shown in Fig. 7. The behaviors of the two detec-
tion methods are diﬀerent, but both of their correlations
eventually tend to strong correlation due to the losses.
Therefore, the serious break of decorrelation condition
will degrade the sensitivity in the phase precision mea-
surement.

V. CONCLUSIONS

FIG. 7: (Color online) The linear correlation coeﬃcients Jn2
as a function of (a) the transmission rate T ; (b) the collisional
dephasing rate Γτ , where g = 2, |α| = 10, and θ2 − θ1 = π,
and φ = 0.062.

The LCCs Jx2(ˆxa2, ˆxb2) and Jn2(ˆna2, ˆnb2) as a function
of the phase shift φ is shown in Fig. 5. Due to the LCC
Jx2(ˆxa2, ˆxb2) is dependent on θ1, the intermode correla-
tion coeﬃcients Jx2(ˆxa2, ˆxb2) ranges between −1 and 0
when θ1 = 0. The LCC Jn2(ˆna2, ˆnb2) is positive, and
Jn2(ˆna2, ˆnb2) ranges between 0 and 1.

This decorrelation point (φ = 0) Jx2(ˆxa2, ˆxb2) = 0 is
very important for atom-light hybrid interferometer us-
ing the homodyne detection [50]. At this point (φ = 0)
the noise of output ﬁeld [h(∆ˆxa2)2i = 1/4] is the same
as that of input ﬁeld and it is the lowest in our scheme
as shown in Fig. 2. The optimal phase sensitivity ∆φHD
and the maximal SNRHD are obtained at this point with
diﬀerent θα. The LCC Jx2 as a function of the trans-
mission rate T and the collisional dephasing rates Γτ are
shown in Fig. 6. With the decrease of the transmission
rate T or the increase of Γτ , the LCCs Jx2 is reduced and
tend to −1. Due to large loss (T small) or large deco-
herence (Γτ large) one arm inside the interferomter (the
optical ﬁeld ˆa′
1) is vanished,
the decorrelation condition does not exist. Therefore, the
serious break of decorrelation condition will degrade the
sensitivity in the phase precision measurement.

This decorrelation point (φ = 0) Jn2(ˆna2, ˆnb2) = 0 is
also very important for the intensity detection. The low

We gave out the phase sensitivities and the SNRs of
the atom-light hybrid interferometer with the method of
homodyne detection and intensity detection. Using the
homodyne detection, for given input intensity Nα and
coupling intensity g the optimal sensitivity ∆φHD and
the maximal SNRHD is not only dependent on the phase
shift φ but also dependent on the phase θα of the input
coherent state. We obtain that the sensitivity is low (i.e.
∆φHD large) when the SNRHD is high and vice versa
because the optimal point changes with θα. Using the
intensity detection, the optimal sensitivity ∆φID and the
maximal SNRID is only dependent on the phase shift φ for
given input intensity Nα and coupling intensity g. Under
the balanced condition, the maximal SNRID is obtained
when the phase is 0 and the optimal phase sensitivity
∆φID is obtained when the phase is nearby 0. The loss
of light ﬁeld and atomic decoherence will degrade the
sensitivity and the SNR of phase measurement, which can
be explained from the break of decorrelation conditions.
