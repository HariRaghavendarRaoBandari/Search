The recently discovered type-II Weyl points appear at the boundary between electron and hole
pockets. Type-II Weyl semimetals that host such points are predicted to exhibit a new type of
chiral anomaly and possess thermodynamic properties very diﬀerent from their type-I counterparts.
In this Letter, we describe the prediction of a type-II Weyl semimetal phase in the transition metal
diphosphides MoP2 and WP2. These materials are characterized by relatively simple band structures
with four pairs of type-II Weyl points. Neighboring Weyl points have the same chirality, which makes
the predicted topological phase robust with respect to small perturbations of the crystalline lattice.
In addition, this peculiar arrangement of the Weyl points results in long topological Fermi arcs, thus
making them readily accessible in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.

Topological semimetals host band degeneracies in the
vicinity of the Fermi level (EF) that are associated with
certain integer-valued topological invariants [1–9]. Since
these invariants cannot continuously change their val-
ues, the associated degeneracies are protected against
perturbations. One such semimetal phase – the Weyl
semimetal (WSM) – hosts point-like linear band crossings
of two bands with linear dispersion, the so-called Weyl
points (WPs), in the vicinity of EF. These WPs repre-
sent sources or sinks of Berry curvature, and their asso-
ciated topological invariant is the Chern number C = ±1
computed on a surface in momentum space that encloses
the WP. Positive (negative) Chern numbers correspond
to a source (sink) of the Berry curvature. A variety of
topology-driven physical phenomena is predicted and ob-
served in WSMs, ranging from the observation of open
Fermi arcs in the surface spectrum [2, 10] to the realiza-
tion of the chiral anomaly of quantum ﬁeld theory [11–
17].

It was recently shown [4] that unlike standard Lorentz-
invariant ﬁeld theory, condensed matter physics has two
distinct types of Weyl fermions, and hence WSMs. While
standard type-I Weyl fermions with closed Fermi sur-
faces were discovered in materials of the TaAs fam-
ily [8, 9, 19–25], the novel type-II Weyl fermions appear
at the boundary between electron and hole pockets, leav-
ing an open Fermi surface which results in the anisotropic
chiral anomaly [4]. Two representatives of type-II WSMs
materials considered to date are the orthorhombic low-
temperature phases of WTe2 and MoTe2 [4, 26–28]. Eight
(four) type-II WPs appear in WTe2 (MoTe2) formed by
the valence and conduction bands. In WTe2 some of the
carrier pockets become topologically non-trivial, while in
MoTe2 they are all trivial, and the two materials rep-
resent very diﬀerent Fermi arc arrangements [4, 27]. In
both cases, however, the band structure is very compli-
cated and the arrangement of WPs is sensitive to small

changes in the crystal structure, which, in turn, is sensi-
tive to temperature [26, 27]. Moreover, the proximity of
WPs with opposite Chern numbers in k-space, as well as
the existence of crossings between bands other than the
topmost valence and the lowest conduction, at energies
close to that of the WPs, makes the experimental con-
ﬁrmation of the type-II Weyl phase in WTe2 and MoTe2
a challenging task. The identiﬁcation of materials with
stable and easily observable type-II WPs thus sets an
important problem in the study of this new topological
phase.

In this Letter, we predict the existence of the type-
II WSM phase in the previously synthesized compounds
MoP2 and WP2. The crystal structure of these com-
pounds is diﬀerent from the previously reported ditel-
lurides, resulting in a simpler band structure around EF
and a peculiar arrangement of WPs with nearest nodes
characterized by the same Chern numbers, thus being
stable against annihilating each other upon small lattice
perturbations. This stability results in the presence of ro-
bust clearly visible long Fermi arcs at the surfaces of these
compounds, which we expect to be readily observable in
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) ex-
periments.

The two compounds were identiﬁed by performing a
high-throughput screening of the band structure topol-
ogy of materials in the Inorganic Crystal Structure
Database (ICSD) [29], using the hybrid Wannier charge
center technique [6, 7] as implemented in the Z2Pack
package [32]. Both MoP2 and WP2 crystallize in an or-
thorhombic base-centered structure [3, 33] containing two
formula units per unit cell as shown in Fig. 1a. Both
crystals are non-centrosymmetric and belong to the non-
symmorphic space group Cmc21 (36), which contains
three symmetries: a C2 screw axis along the [001] di-
rection (21), a mirror plane normal to the [100] direction
(m, shown in green in Fig. 1b), and a glide plane normal

to the [010] direction (g, shown in red in Fig. 1b). Al-
though the crystalline symmetries of MoP2 and WP2 are
similar to that of the ditellurides, the atomic structure of
the phosphides is very diﬀerent. While the structure of
XTe2 consist of van der Waals bonded layers, no layered
structure exists in XP2 materials.

The electronic structure of MoP2 and WP2 was com-
puted from ﬁrst principles [1, 2]. The methodology is de-
scribed in more detail in the Supplemental Material [35].
The band structures along the high-symmetry directions
of the Brillouin zone (BZ) are shown in Fig. 1c and 1d, for
MoP2 and WP2, respectively. Both compounds share a
similar semimetallic band structure, very diﬀerent from
that of the XTe2 compounds, with an electron pocket
around Y and a hole pocket in the vicinity of the XS
direction. The Fermi contour of these pockets is shown
with a dashed line in Fig. 2a for MoP2 at kz = 0. The
main diﬀerence between the two compounds is that the
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is stronger in WP2, which re-
sults in a larger band splitting compared to MoP2.

The band structure of MoP2 and WP2 along the high
symmetry lines of the BZ suggests that these compounds
are ordinary semimetals. However, a more careful anal-
ysis reveals the presence of eight points in the kz = 0
plane where conduction and valence bands touch. This
can be seen in Fig. 2a, where we plot the energy diﬀer-
ence between the lowest conduction and the highest va-
lence bands in the kz = 0 plane of the BZ. The gap closes
at two inequivalent points w1 and w(cid:48)
1, located away from
any high-symmetry line. The positions of these points
are listed in Table I. The six other points wi and w(cid:48)
i
(i = 2, 3, 4) are related to w1 and w(cid:48)
1 by mirror and time-

reversal (T ) symmetries. In both compounds, w1 and w(cid:48)
are at −0.410 eV and −0.364 eV relative to the Fermi
level in MoP2 and at −0.471 eV and −0.340 eV relative
to the Fermi level in WP2.

Analogously to the case of XTe2, the existence of de-
generacy points in the kz = 0 plane of MoP2 and WP2 is
due to the presence of the product symmetry C2T , which
restricts a general 2 × 2 Hamiltonian in the plane to be
of the form
H(kx, ky, 0) = d0(kx, ky)σ0 + dy(kx, ky)σy + dz(kx, ky)σz,
(1)
where σy,z are the corresponding Pauli matrices and σ0
is the 2×2 unit matrix associated with the kinetic en-
ergy term of the type-II Weyl Hamiltonian [4]. The full
derivation of the model Hamiltonian is presented in the
Supplemental Material [35]. In order to establish that the
degeneracies wi and w(cid:48)
i are indeed WPs, we computed the
Chern numbers of surfaces enclosing these points follow-
ing the method described in Ref. [4]. We ﬁnd that both

conclusion, we ﬁtted the ab initio band structure in the
vicinity of the WPs to ﬁnd the coeﬃcients di of Eq. 1
to the linear order in k [35]. For both the w1 and w(cid:48)
1
points, the kinetic term dominates the spectrum along
the ky direction around the WP, as illustrated in Fig. 2e
for the WP w1. The dominant kinetic term in the ky
direction suggests a possible observation of the type-II
chiral anomaly [4] in XP2 compounds when both electric
and magnetic ﬁelds are applied along this direction.

The WPs w1 and w(cid:48)

1 are separated in energy. To un-
derstand the origin of this separation, we note that the
two points are formed by spin-split bands, as can be con-
cluded from Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d, where the energy dis-
persion of MoP2 is shown along a path connecting the
two WPs in the kz = 0 plane and along the kz direc-
tion, respectively.
Indeed, for a calculation performed
without taking into account SOC, the electron and hole
pockets touch at 4 crossing points di in the kz = 0 plane,
which have the associated topological charge C = ±2 and
correspond to the superposition of two WPs of the same
chirality, as expected for SU(2) symmetry [5]. These dou-
ble WPs are split by the SOC into single nodes wi and
w(cid:48)
i (see Fig. 2c) that have the same chirality.
The magnitude of the splitting in energy and k-space
between the two adjacent WPs wi and w(cid:48)
i is hence directly
related to the strength of the SOC. These splittings are
larger in WP2 (131 meV and 0.035 ˚A−1) than in MoP2
(46 meV and 0.013 ˚A−1) (see Table I), as expected due
to the larger SOC strength in W. This suggests the possi-
bility of tuning the separation between the WPs in these
compounds in both energy and momentum by applying
strain or chemical substitution, since this changes the ef-
fective SOC.

Unlike the case of ditellurides, the neighboring WPs in
XP2 materials have the same chirality, and thus cannot
annihilate each other. This implies that MoP2 and WP2
realize a stable type-II WSM phase that is far from a pos-
sible topological phase transition caused by a merging of
the opposite chirality WPs. Opposite chirality WPs can
annihilate when they reach the same point of the 3D BZ,
so the smallest distance in k-space between WPs with op-
posite Chern number C can be considered as a measure of
stability of the WSM phase. We ﬁnd this distance to be
0.38˚A−1 and 0.52˚A−1 in MoP2 and WP2, respectively,
which constitutes 20% and 26% of the corresponding in-
verse lattice constants. These numbers can be compared
to the distance between opposite chirality WPs in the
TaAs materials family, in particular TaP where the dis-
tance is the longest[8] and is 0.09˚A−1 (4% of the inverse
lattice constant). The distance between the neighboring
opposite chirality WPs in XTe2 is 0.7% of the inverse
lattice constant.

One evident consequence of the large k-space separa-
tion of opposite chirality WPs in XP2 is the possibility of
the observation of extended topological Fermi arcs in the
surface of these materials. For type-I WPs, which have

the charges of the other six points are obtained by sym-
metry arguments: mirror reﬂection ﬂips the sign of the
2,4 have C = −1,
Chern number of a WP, thus w2,4 and w(cid:48)
while T -reﬂection preserves it, so C = +1 for w3 and w(cid:48)
3.
The WPs in MoP2 and WP2 are of type-II as can be
concluded by examining the Fermi surface at the energies
of w1 and w(cid:48)
1, shown in Fig. 2b for the case of MoP2.
Both nodes appear at the points of contact between the
electron pocket located around Y and the hole pocket
located along the XS direction. To further conﬁrm this

a point-like Fermi surface, these Fermi arcs connect the
projections of the opposite chirality WPs onto the sur-
face. In contrast, the Fermi surface of the type-II WPs is
open and the projection of the points is generally hidden
within the projection of a charge-carrier pocket.

We consider the (001) surface of MoP2 and WP2, since
the eight WPs project onto distinct points of the cor-
responding surface BZ, allowing for the observation of
Fermi arcs. We ﬁnd that at all energies all electron and
hole pockets enclose an equal number of chiral and an-
tichiral WPs, therefore the Chern number of all these
pockets vanishes. From this perspective, no Fermi arcs
connecting electron and hole pockets are expected. In-
deed, at EF we ﬁnd that the projected WPs are covered
by the projection of the electron pocket around the Y
point and no Fermi arcs can be observed. However, we
do ﬁnd topological Fermi arcs in these materials at lower
energies as we explain below.

We computed the surface density of states of MoP2 us-
ing the tight-binding model, obtained from the bulk Wan-
nier functions [37] for Mo d and P p orbitals, in order to
compute the Green’s function of the semi-inifnite surface
according to the method introduced in Ref. [38]. Three
possible surface terminations were investigated: one Mo-
terminated and two P-terminated denoted as 1P and 2P.

Furthermore, the top and bottom (001) surfaces of MoP2
are inequivalent, thus giving rise to six diﬀerent conﬁg-
urations (see Fig. 3a–f). The surface densities of states
at the energy of w1, 0.41 eV below EF, all show two
distinct Fermi arcs. One of these arcs connects two wi
points of opposite chirality (green line in Fig. 3a–f), while
the other one connects two w(cid:48)
i points of opposite chirality
(orange line in Fig. 3a–f). Both the connectivity and the
shape of the Fermi arcs depend on the details of the sur-
face termination. For the Mo and 1P top surfaces as well
as for the 1P bottom surface, the Fermi arcs connect w1
(w(cid:48)
4) within the surface BZ, which is shown
as black hexagon in Fig. 3. On the 2P top surface and
the Mo bottom surface w1 (w(cid:48)
1) is connected by a Fermi
arc to w4 (w(cid:48)
4) across the surface BZ boundary. Finally,
on the 2P bottom surface, the Fermi arcs connect the w1
(w(cid:48)

1) and w2 (w(cid:48)
While the connectivity of these Fermi arcs depends on
a particular surface, one can argue that the arcs them-
selves are of topological origin. In order to demonstrate
this we computed the Z2 invariant on the T -symmetric
plane P shown in Fig. 3g and ﬁnd it to be non-trivial (see
Supplemental Material for details [35]). This implies that
this cut of the BZ, on which the spectrum is gapped at
all points, is a quantum spin Hall eﬀect system [8], and

1) and w4 (w(cid:48)

2) WPs.

therefore it is guaranteed to show topologically protected
edge states. In other words, any line cut of the (001) sur-
face BZ that passes between the two WPs has to cross a
topological Fermi arc as shown in Fig. 3h. The conclu-
sion that the Fermi arcs connecting points wi and w(cid:48)
i are
of topological origin agrees with the values of Z2 invari-
ants deﬁned on diﬀerent T -symmetric planes of the BZ,
as further discussed in the Supplemental Material [35].

The predicted Fermi arcs span extended regions of k-
space and are localized below the Fermi level. Therefore
they should be readily observable in ARPES experiments
on a cleaved (001) surface of XP2 compounds. Experi-
mental observation of these arcs will provide an unam-
biguous evidence of the type-II Weyl fermions in these
materials. It should be noted that other surface states
are visible in Figs. 3a–f. A careful examination of the
electronic structure shows that these states do not origi-
nate from Weyl points and are thus topologically trivial,
as discussed in the Supplemental Material [35].

In conclusion, we theoretically identiﬁed a new family
of type-II Weyl semimetals in the transition disphophides
MoP2 and WP2. The Brillouin zone of these materials
contains 4 pairs of Weyl nodes with the same chirality
in the kz = 0 plane, which implies robustness of the pre-
dicted Weyl semimetal phase. We predict that a type-II
chiral anomaly should be observable in these compounds
and that long Fermi arcs should be detectable by ARPES
experiments on the [001] surface with a great variety of
possible arrangements depending on the surface termina-
tion.

I. METHODOLOGY

The electronic structure of MoP2 and WP2 was computed within the density functional theory (DFT) framework us-
ing the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as implemented in QUANTUM-ESPRESSO software package [S1].
Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is taken into account with the help of fully relativistic ultrasoft pseudopotentials [S2]. The
calculations were carried out using an 885 k-point mesh and a planewave kinetic energy cutoﬀ of 50 Ry for the
wavefunctions. We used the experimentally determined crystal structure from Ref. [S3].

II. MODEL HAMILTONIAN OF THE WEYL POINTS

The general 2 × 2 Hamiltonian restricted by C2T symmetry in the kz = 0 plane is of the form [S4, S5]

H(kx, ky, 0) = d0σ0 + dyσy + dzσz.

(S1)

The co-dimension of the system of equations deﬁning a band gap closure (dy = dz = 0) is zero, meaning that stable
nodal points can exist. The general linearized form of the Hamiltonian around a crossing point in the kz = 0 plane is
given by

H = v1kx + v2ky + (akx + bky)σy + (ckx + dky)σz + ekzσx + ε0,

(S2)

where the ki are relative to the crossing point. The ﬁtting parameters for the diﬀerent Weyl points are given in Table
S1. From these parameters, one can easily verify that all Weyl fermions are of type-II, as shown in Fig. 2e of the main
text.

III. CHIRALITY OF THE WEYL NODES AND TOPOLOGICAL INVARIANTS

The chirality of the Weyl points wi and w(cid:48)

i was obtained by computing the ﬂux of Berry curvature through a surface
enclosing them. In order to carry out this calculation, we follow the method proposed by Ref. [S4]. We calculate
Wannier charge centers on longitudinal loops around a sphere enclosing the Weyl point (see Fig. S1a). The sum of
the Wannier charge centers on a loop with longitudinal angle θi corresponds to the Berry phase accumulated along
the loop, or similarly to the average position (cid:104)φ(cid:105) of the charge on the loop. When the angle θ varies from 0 to π, the
loops cover a closed surface and the average position of center (cid:104)φ(cid:105) can only be shifted by an integer number of 2π.
This number correspond to the chirality of the Weyl node enclosed in the sphere.
We apply this procedure to a sphere enclosing w1 (red curve, Fig. S1a). As the angle θ varies from 0 to π, the
average position of the Wannier centers on the loops ((cid:104)φ(cid:105)) is shifted by 2π, which indicates that w1 is a source of
Berry curvature with chirality C = +1. The Weyl node w2, which is the mirror image of w1, is then expected to carry
a topological charge C = −1. This is conﬁrmed by the evolution of the WCC on a sphere enclosing w2 (blue curve,
Fig. S1a) The same method can be applied to show that the Weyl node w(cid:48)
To further elucidate the topological character of MoP2 and WP2, several topological invariants were computed
from ﬁrst-principles. The presence of time-reversal (T ) symmetry allows the computation of the Z2 invariant on

1 has a chirality C = +1 (see Fig. S1b).

T -symmetric planes in the BZ, deﬁned by ki = 0, π, where i = x, y, z. The kz = 0 hosts WPs and does not have a
well-deﬁned invariant. For the other ﬁve planes, the topological invariant is computed using a hybrid Wannier centers
technique [S6, S7] and found to be trivial. Nevertheless, it is still possible to deﬁne a non-trivial Z2 invariant [S8] by
considering a curved T -symmetric plane crossing between the w1 and w(cid:48)

4). The path along which such a plane P cut the kz = 0 plane is shown on Fig. S1c. The evolution

of the Wannier charge centers positions on the half plane P from Γ to Y is shown on Fig. S1d which is not gapped
and corresponds to a non-trivial Z2 invariant.

IV. ADDITIONAL TOPOLOGICAL FEATURES BELOW THE VALENCE BAND

An examination of the band structure plots along the ΓY and Y X1 direction in Fig.1 of the main text, reveals that
other non-trivial crossings exist between the bands below the valence and above the conduction band. In order to
allow an easy experimental observation of the main WPs, it is important that such features are located suﬃciently far
in energy or k-space from the wi and w(cid:48)
i points. In the valence bands, 12 WPs corresponding to crossings between the
n− 1 and n− 2 bands (where n is the number of valence electrons) are located in the kz = 0 plane on each side of the
ΓY line at ≈ 0.26 eV below the wi WP. In the conduction band, 8 WPs corresponding to crossings between the n + 2
and n + 3 bands are located in the kz = 0 plane at ≈ 0.8 eV above the wi WP. The energies and position of these
features show that the main WPs wi and w(cid:48)
i are well isolated from any others WPs. This provides a great advantage
for the experimental characterization of the Weyl phase over other type-II WSM such as WTe2 and MoTe2.
Here, we describe additional topological features that appear below the valence band in MoP2 and WP2. The
closest in energy to the Fermi level corresponds to crossing between the n− 1 and n− 2 bands (where n is the number
of valence electron). 12 Weyl points formed by these bands are located in the kz = 0 plane on each side of the ΓY
line. The position of 3 inequivalent points x1, x2 and x3 is shown on Fig. S2 for MoP2. The 9 other points can be
obtained by applying the mirror and time-reversal symmetries. The highest in energy of these points has an energy of
−0.673 eV with respect to the Fermi level (see Table S2). They are thus separated from the lowest Weyl point wi by
an energy of ≈ 0.26 eV. The position in k-space and energy of the xi points demonstrate that the main Weyl points
wi and w(cid:48)
i are well isolated and that the additional surface states that appears in Fig. 3a–f of the main text are not

of topological origin.
