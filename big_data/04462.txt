MINIMUM VERTEX DEGREE CONDITIONS FOR LOOSE HAMILTON

CYCLES IN 3-UNIFORM HYPERGRAPHS

ENNO BU(cid:223), HIÊ. P HÀN, AND MATHIAS SCHACHT

Abstract. We investigate minimum vertex degree conditions for 3-uniform hypergraphs
which ensure the existence of loose Hamilton cycles. A loose Hamilton cycle is a spanning
cycle in which only consecutive edges intersect and these intersections consist of precisely
one vertex.

We prove that every 3-uniform n-vertex (n even) hypergraph H with minimum ver-
contains a loose Hamilton cycle. This bound is

call the cycle loose whereas the cycle is called tight if ‘ “ k ´ 1. Naturally, we say that a
k-uniform, n-vertex hypergraph H contains a Hamilton ‘-cycle if there is a subhypergraph
of H which forms an ‘-cycle and which covers all vertices of H. Note that a Hamilton
‘-cycle contains exactly n{pk ´ ‘q edges, implying that the number of vertices of H must
be divisible by pk ´ ‘q which we indicate by n P pk ´ ‘qN.

Minimum collective degree conditions which ensure the existence of tight Hamilton
cycles were ﬁrst studied in [6] and in [12,13]. In particular, in [12,13] Rödl, Ruciński, and
Szemerédi found asymptotically sharp bounds for this problem.
Theorem 1. For every k ě 3 and γ ą 0 there exists an n0 such that every k-uniform
hypergraph H “ pV, Eq on |V | “ n ě n0 vertices with δk´1pHq ě p1{2 ` γqn contains a
(cid:3)
tight Hamilton cycle.

The corresponding question for loose cycles was ﬁrst studied by Kühn and Osthus.
In [10] they proved an asymptotically sharp bound on the minimum collective degree which
ensures the existence of loose Hamilton cycles in 3-uniform hypergraphs. This result was
generalised to higher uniformity by the last two authors [4] and independently by Keevash,
Kühn, Osthus and Mycroft in [7].
Theorem 2. For all integers k ě 3 and every γ ą 0 there exists an n0 such that every
k-uniform hypergraph H “ pV, Eq on |V | “ n ě n0 vertices with n P pk ´ 1qN and
δk´1pHq ě p
(cid:3)
Indeed, in [4] asymptotically sharp bounds for Hamilton ‘-cycles for all ‘ ă k{2 were
obtained. Later this result was generalised to all 0 ă ‘ ă k by Kühn, Mycroft, and
Osthus [9]. These results are asymptotically best possible for all k and 0 ă ‘ ă k. Hence,
asymptotically, the problem of ﬁnding Hamilton ‘-cycles in uniform hypergraphs with large
minimum collective degree is solved.

We focus on minimum vertex degree conditions which ensures the existence of Hamilton
cycles. For δ1pHq very few results on spanning subhypergraphs are known (see e.g. [3,11]).
In this paper we give an asymptotically sharp bound on the minimum vertex degree in
3-uniform hypergraphs which enforces the existence of loose Hamilton cycles.
Theorem 3 (Main result). For all γ ą 0 there exists an n0 such that the following holds.

In the proof we apply the so-called absorbing technique. In [12] Rödl, Ruciński, and
Szemerédi introduced this elegant approach to tackle minimum degree problems for spanning
graphs and hypergraphs. In our case it reduces the problem of ﬁnding a loose Hamilton
cycle to the problem of ﬁnding a nearly spanning loose path and indeed, ﬁnding such a
path will be the main obstacle to Theorem 3.

Fact 4. For every n P 2N there exists a 3-uniform hypergraph H3 “ pV, Eq on |V | “ n

Proof. Consider the following 3-uniform hypergraph H3 “ pV, Eq. Let A Y¨ B “ V be a
4 u ´ 1 and let E be the set of all triplets from V with at least
partition of V with |A| “ t n

an arbitrary cycle in H3. Note that every vertex, in particular every vertex from A, is
contained in at most two edges of this cycle. Moreover, every edge of the cycle must
intersect A. Consequently, the cycle contains at most 2|A| ă n{2 edges and, hence, cannot
(cid:3)
be a Hamilton cycle.
We note that the construction H3 in Fact 4 satisﬁes δ2pH3q ě n{4 ´ 1 and indeed, the
same construction proves that the minimum collective degree condition given in Theorem 2
is asymptotically best possible for the case k “ 3.

This leads to the following conjecture for minimum vertex degree conditions enforcing
loose Hamilton cycles in k-uniform hypergraphs. Let k ě 3 and let Hk “ pV, Eq be the
k-uniform, n-vertex hypergraph on V “ A Y¨ B with |A| “ n
´ 1. Let E consist of all
2pk´1q
k-sets intersecting A in at least one vertex. Then Hk does not contain a loose Hamilton
cycle and we believe that any k-uniform, n-vertex hypergraph H which has minimum
vertex degree δ1pHq ě δ1pHkq ` opn2q contains a loose Hamilton cycle. Indeed, Theorem 3
veriﬁes this for the case k “ 3.

§2. Proof of the main result

The proof of Theorem 3 will be given in Section 2.3. It uses several auxiliary lemmas

which we introduce in Section 2.2. We start with an outline of the proof.
2.1. Outline of the proof. We will build a loose Hamilton cycle by connecting loose
paths. Formally, a 3-uniform hypergraph P is a loose path if there is an ordering pv1, . . . , vtq
of its vertices such that every edge consists of three consecutive vertices, every vertex
is contained in an edge and two consecutive edges intersect in exactly one vertex. The
elements v1 and vt are called the ends of P.

The Absorbing Lemma (Lemma 7) asserts that every 3-uniform hypergraph H “ pV, Eq
with suﬃciently large minimum vertex degree contains a so-called absorbing loose path P,
which has the following property: For every set U Ă V (cid:114) V pPq with |U| P 2N and |U| ď βn
(for some appropriate 0 ă β ă γ) there exists a loose path Q with the same ends as P,
which covers precisely the vertices V pPq Y U.

The Absorbing Lemma reduces the problem of ﬁnding a loose Hamilton cycle to the
simpler problem of ﬁnding an almost spanning loose cycle, which contains the absorbing
path P and covers at least p1 ´ βqn of the vertices. We approach this simpler problem
as follows. Let H1 be the induced subhypergraph H, which we obtain after removing the
vertices of the absorbing path P guaranteed by the Absorbing Lemma. We remove from H1
a “small” set R of vertices, called the reservoir (see Lemma 6), which has the property
that many loose paths can be connected to one loose cycle by using the vertices of R only.
Let H2 be the remaining hypergraph after removing the vertices from R. We will
choose P and R small enough, so that δ1pH2q ě p 7
. The third auxiliary
lemma, the Path-tiling Lemma (Lemma 10), asserts that all but opnq vertices of H2 can be
covered by a family of pairwise disjoint loose paths and, moreover, the number of those
paths will be constant (independent of n). Consequently, we can connect those paths
and P to form a loose cycle by using exclusively vertices from R. This way we obtain a
loose cycle in H, which covers all but the opnq left-over vertices from H2 and some left-over
vertices from R. We will ensure that the number of those yet uncovered vertices will be
smaller than βn and, hence, we can appeal to the absorption property of P and obtain a
Hamilton cycle.

other lemmas we do not attempt to optimise the constants.

2.2. Auxiliary lemmas. In this section we introduce the technical lemmas needed for
the proof of the main theorem.

We start with the connecting lemma which is used to connect several “short” loose
paths to a long one. Let H be a 3-uniform hypergraph and pai, biqiPrks a set consisting
of k mutually disjoint pairs of vertices. We say that a set of triples pxi, yi, ziqiPrks connects

Suppose that a and b are ends of two disjoint loose paths not intersecting tx, y, zu and
suppose that px, y, zq connects pa, bq. Then this connection would join the two paths to
one loose path. The following lemma states that several paths can be connected, provided
the minimum vertex degree is suﬃciently large.
Lemma 5 (Connecting lemma). Let γ ą 0, let m ě 1 be an integer, and let H “ pV, Eq
be a 3-uniform hypergraph on n vertices with δ1pHq ě
For every set pai, biqiPrms of mutually disjoint pairs of distinct vertices, there exists a set
of triples pxi, yi, ziqiPrms connecting pai, biqiPrms.
Proof. We will ﬁnd the triples pxi, yi, ziq to connect ai with bi for i P rms inductively as
follows. Suppose, for some j ă k the triples pxi, yi, ziq with i ă j are constructed so far
and for pa, bq “ paj, bjq we want to ﬁnd a triple px, y, zq to connect a and b. Let

connecting triple exists, then for every vertex u P U one of the following must hold: either u
is isolated in LarUs or LbrUs or it is adjacent to exactly one vertex w in both graphs LarUs
and LbrUs. In other words, any vertex not isolated in LarUs has at most one neighbour
in LbrUs. Let Ia be the set of isolated vertices in LarUs. Since epLarUsq ą 1

When connecting several paths to a long one we want to make sure that the vertices
used for the connection all come from a small set, called reservoir, which is disjoint to the
paths. The existence of such a set is guaranteed by the following.
Lemma 6 (Reservoir lemma). For all 0 ă γ ă 1{4 there exists an n0 such that for
every 3-uniform hypergraph H “ pV, Eq on n ą n0 vertices with minimum vertex degree
δ1pHq ě
there is a set R of size at most γn with the following property: For
every system pai, biqiPrks consisting of k ď γ3n{12 mutually disjoint pairs of vertices from V
there is a triple system connecting pai, biqiPrks which, moreover, contains vertices from R
only.

Proof. We shall show that a random set R has the required properties with positive
probability. For this proof we use some exponential tail estimates. Here we will follow a
basic technique described in [5, Section 2.6]. Alternatively Lemma 6 could be deduced
more directly from Janson’s inequality.

For given 0 ă γ ă 1{4 let n0 be suﬃciently large. Let H be as stated in the lemma and
v P V pHq. Let Lpvq be the link graph deﬁned on the vertex set V pHq (cid:114) tvu, having the
edges e P EpLpvqq if e Y tvu P H. Note that Lpvq contains degHpvq edges. Since the edge
set of the omplete graph Kn can be decomposed into n ´ 1 edge disjoint matchings, we
can decompose the edge set of L into i0 “ i0pvq ă n pairwise edge disjoint matchings. We
denote these matchings by M1pvq, . . . , Mi0pvq.

We randomly choose a vertex set Vp from V by including each vertex u P V into Vp with

probability p “ γ ´ γ3 independently. For every i P ri0s let

denote the number of edges e P Mipvq contained in Vp. This way Xipvq is a binomially

Repeating the same argument for every vertex v P V we infer from the union bound

powerful loose path P which can absorb any small set U Ă V (cid:114) V pPq. In the following
note that
Lemma 7 (Absorbing lemma). For all γ ą 0 there exist β ą 0 and n0 such that the
following holds. Let H “ pV, Eq be a 3-uniform hypergraph on n ą n0 vertices which

that for all subsets U Ă V (cid:114) V pPq of size at most βn and |U| P 2N there exists a loose
path Q Ă H with V pQq “ V pPq Y U and P and Q have exactly the same ends.

The principle used in the proof of Lemma 7 goes back to Rödl, Ruciński, and Szemerédi.
They introduced the concept of absorption, which, roughly speaking, stands for a local
extension of a given structure, which preserves the global structure. In our context of loose
cycle we say that a 7-tuple pv1, . . . , v7q absorbs the two vertices x, y P V if

‚ v1v2v3, v3v4v5, v5v6v7 P H and
‚ v2xv4, v4yv6 P H

are guaranteed. In particular, pv1, . . . , v7q and pv1, v3, v2, x, v4, y, v6, v5, v7q both form loose
paths which, moreover, have the same ends. The proof of Lemma 7 relies on the following
result which states that for each pair of vertices there are many 7-tuples absorbing this
pair, provided the minimum vertex degree of H is suﬃciently large.

Then for every pair of vertices x, y P V the number of 7-tuples absorbing x and y is at

Proof. For given γ ą 0 we choose n0 “ 168{γ7. First we show the following.
Claim 9. For every pair x, y P V pHq of vertices there exists a set D “ Dpx, yq Ă V of
size |D| “ γn such that one of the following holds:

‚ degpx, dq ě γn and degpy, dq ě 3
‚ degpy, dq ě γn and degpx, dq ě 3

8n for all d P D or
8n for all d P D.

Proof of Claim 9. By assuming the contrary there exist two vertices x and y such that no
set D “ Dpx, yq fulﬁlls Claim 9.

Let Apzq “ td P V : degpz, dq ă γnu and let a “ |Apxq|{n and b “ |Apyq|{n. Without

degpy, vq ě 3

We continue the proof of Proposition 8. For a given pair x, y P V we will select the tuple

‚ v2xv4, v4yv6 P H

are guaranteed. Note that pv1, . . . , v7q forms a loose path with the ends v1 and v7 and
pv1, v3, v2, x, v4, y, v6, v5, v7q also forms a loose path with the same ends, showing that
pv1, . . . , v7q is indeed an absorbing tuple for the pair a, b. Moreover, we will show that the
number of choices for each vi will give rise to the number of absorbing tuples stated in the
proposition.

First, we want to choose v4 and let Dpx, yq be a set with the properties stated in Claim 9.
Without loss of generality we may assume that |Npy, dq| ě 3
8n for all d P Dpx, yq. Fixing
some v4 P Dpx, yq We choose v2 P Npx, v4q for which there are γn choices. This gives rise to
to hyperegde v2xv4 P H. and applying Claim 9 to v2 and v4 we obtain a set Dpv2, v4q with
the properties stated in Claim 9 and we choose v3 P Dpv2, v4q. We choose v1 P Npv2, v3q to
obtain the edge v1v2v3 P H. Note that |Npv2, v3q| ě γn. Next, we choose v5 from Npv3, v4q
which has size |Npv3, v4q| ě γn. This gives rise to the edge v3v4v5 P H. We choose v6
from the set Npy, v4q with the additional property that degpv5, v6q ě γn{2. Hence, we
obtain v4yv6 P H and we claim that there are at least γn{2 such choices. Otherwise at

With Proposition 8 and the connecting lemma (Lemma 5) at hand the proof of the
absorbing lemma follows a scheme which can be found in [4,12]. We choose a family F of
7-tuples by selecting each 7-tuples with probability p “ γ7n´6{448 independently. Then, it
is easily shown that with non-zero probability the family F satisﬁes

‚ for all pairs x, y P V there are at least pγ7n7{16 tuples in F which absorbs x, y

Then there is a family of p disjoint loose paths in H which covers all but at most αn vertices

The proof of Lemma 10 uses the weak regularity lemma for hypergraphs and will be

given in Section 3.

2.3. Proof of the main theorem. In this section we give the proof of the main result,
Theorem 3. The proof is based on the three auxiliary lemmas introduced in Section 2.2
and follows the outline given in Section 2.1.
Proof of Theorem 3. For given γ ą 0 we apply the Absorbing Lemma (Lemma 7) with γ{8
to obtain β ą 0 and n7. We apply the Reservoir Lemma (Lemma 6) for γ1 “ mintβ{3, γ{8u
to obtain n6 which is n0 of Lemma 6. Finally, we apply the Path-tiling Lemma (Lemma 10)
with γ{2 and α “ β{3 to obtain p and n10. The n0 of Theorem 3 is chosen by

Consequently, Lemma 10 applied to H2 (with γ10 and α) yields a loose path tiling of H2
which covers all but at most α|V 2| ď αn vertices from V 2 and which consists of at most p
paths. We denote the set of the uncovered vertices in V 2 by T. Further, let P1,P2 . . . ,Pq
with q ď p denote the paths of the tiling. By applying the reservoir lemma appropriately
we connect the loose paths P0,P1, . . . ,Pq to one loose cycle C Ă H.

Let U “ V (cid:114) V pCq be the set of vertices not covered by the cycle C. Since U Ď RY T we
have |U| ď pα` γ6qn ď βn. Moreover, since C is a loose cycle and n P 2N we have |U| P 2N.
Thus, using the absorption property of P0 (see (6)) we can replace the subpath P0 in C by
a path Q (since P0 and Q have the same ends) and since V pQq “ V pP0q Y U the resulting
cycle is a loose Hamilton cycle of H.

In this section we give the proof of the Path-tiling Lemma, Lemma 10. Lemma 10 will
be derived from the following lemma. Let M be the 3-uniform hypergraph deﬁned on the

Then there is an M-tiling of H which covers all but at most αn vertices of H.

The proof of Lemma 11 requires the regularity lemma which we introduce in Section 3.1.
Sections 3.2 and 3.3 are devoted to the proof of Lemma 11 and ﬁnally, in Section 3.4, we
deduce Lemma 10 from Lemma 11 by making use of the regularity lemma.

3.1. The weak regularity lemma and the cluster hypergraph. In this section we
introduce the weak hypergraph regularity lemma, a straightforward extension of Szemerédi’s

ENNO BU(cid:223), HIÊ. P HÀN, AND MATHIAS SCHACHT

12
regularity lemma for graphs [15]. Since we only apply the lemma to 3-uniform hypergraphs
we will restrict the introduction to this case.

Let H “ pV, Eq be a 3-uniform hypergraph and let A1, A2, A3 be mutually disjoint
non-empty subsets of V . We deﬁne epA1, A2, A3q to be the number of edges with one vertex
in each Ai, i P r3s, and the density of H with respect to pA1, A2, A3q as

dpA1, A2, A3q “ eHpA1, A2, A3q
|A1||A2||A3|

.

We say the triple pV1, V2, V3q of mutually disjoint subsets V1, V2, V3 Ď V is pε, dq-regular,
for constants ε ą 0 and d ě 0, if

|dpA1, A2, A3q ´ d| ď ε

for all triple of subsets Ai Ă Vi, i P r3s, satisfying |Ai| ě ε|Vi|. The triple pV1, V2, V3q is
called ε-regular if it is pε, dq-regular for some d ě 0. It is immediate from the deﬁnition
that an pε, dq-regular triple pV1, V2, V3q is pε1, dq-regular for all ε1 ą ε and if V 1i Ă Vi has
size |V 1i | ě c|Vi|, then pV 11, V 12, V 13q is pε{c, dq-regular.
Next we show that regular triples can be almost perfectly covered by copies of M
provided the sizes of the partition classes obey certain restrictions. First note that M is a
subhypergraph of a tight path. The latter is deﬁned similarly to a loose path, i.e. there is
an ordering pv1, . . . , vtq of the vertices such that every edge consists of three consecutive
vertices, every vertex is contained in an edge and two consecutive edges intersect in exactly
two vertices.
Proposition 12. Suppose H is a 3-uniform hypergraph on m vertices with at least dm3
edges. Then there is a tight path in H which covers at least 2pdm`1q vertices. In particular,
if H is 3-partite with the partition classes V1, V2, V3 and 2dm ą 10 then for each i P r3s
there is a copy of M in H which intersects Vi in exactly two vertices and the other partition
classes in three vertices.
Proof. Starting from H we remove all edges containing u, v for each pair u, v P V of
vertices such that 0 ă degpu, vq ă 2dm. We keep doing this until every pair u, v satisﬁes
degpu, vq “ 0 or degpu, vq ě 2dm in the current hypergraph H1. Since less than

ˆ

˙

¨ 2dm ă dm3 ď epHq

edges were removed during the process we know that H1 is not empty. Hence we can pick
a maximal non-empty tight path pv1, v2, . . . , vtq in H1. Since the pair v1, v2 is contained in
an edge in H1 it is contained in 2dm edges and since the path was chosen to be maximal all

MINIMUM VERTEX DEGREE CONDITIONS FOR LOOSE HAMILTON CYCLES

13
these vertices must lie in the path. Hence, the chosen tight path contains at least 2pdm`1q
vertices. This completes the ﬁrst part of the proof.

For the second part, note that there is only one way to embed a tight path into a 3-partite
3-uniform hypergraph once the two starting vertices are ﬁxed. Since M is a subhypergraph
of the tight path on eight vertices we obtain the second part of the statement by possibly
(cid:3)
deleting up to two starting vertices.
Proposition 13. Suppose the triple pV1, V2, V3q is pε, dq-regular with d ě 2ε and suppose
the sizes of the partition classes satisfy

m “ |V1| ě |V2| ě |V3| with 5|V1| ď 3p|V2| ` |V3|q

(7)
and 2ε2m ą 7. Then there is an M-tiling of pV1, V2, V3q leaving at most 3εm vertices
uncovered.
Proof. Note that if we take a copy of M intersecting Vi, i P r3s in exactly two vertices then
this copy intersects the other partition classes in exactly three vertices. We deﬁne

ti “ p1 ´ εq1

8 p3|Vj| ` 3|Vk| ´ 5|Vi|q where

i, j, k P r3s are distinct.

Due to our assumption all ti are non-negative and we choose ti copies of M intersecting Vi
in exactly two vertices. This would leave |Vi| ´ p2ti ` 3tj ` 3tkq “ ε|Vi| vertices in Vi
uncovered, hence at most 3εm in total.

To complete the proof we exhibit a copy of M in all three possible types in the remaining
hypergraph, hence showing that the choices of the copies above are indeed possible. To
this end, from the remaining vertices of each partition class Vi take a subset Ui, i P r3s of
size ε|Vi|. Due to the regularity of the triple pV1, V2, V3q we have epU1, U2, U3q ě pd´εqpεmq3.
Hence, by Proposition 12 there is a copy of M (of each type) in pU1, U2, U3q.
(cid:3)

The connection of regular partitions and dense hypergraphs is established by regularity
lemmas. The version introduced here is a straightforward generalisation of the original
regularity lemma to hypergraphs (see, e.g., [1,2,14]).

In the following we show that the cluster hypergraph almost inherits the minimum vertex

the regularity lemma we obtain an pε1, t1q-regular partition V 10 Y¨ V1 Y¨ . . . Y¨ Vt1 of V and let

3.2. Fractional hompMq-tiling. To obtain a large M-tiling in the hypergraph H, we
consider weighted homomorphisms from M into the cluster hypergraph K. To this purpose,
we deﬁne the following.
Deﬁnition 16. Let L be a 3-uniform hypergraph. A function h: V pLq ˆ EpLq Ñ r0, 1s is
called a fractional hompMq-tiling of L if

(a ) hpv, eq ‰ 0 ñ v P e,
(b ) hpvq “
(c ) for every e P EpLq there exists a labeling of the vertices of e “ uvw such that

ePEpLq hpv, eq ď 1,

ř

hpu, eq “ hpv, eq ě hpw, eq ě 2

3 hpu, eq

By hmin we denote the smallest non-zero value of hpv, eq (and we set hmin “ 8 if h ” 0)
and the sum over all values is the weight wphq of h

ÿ

wphq “

hpv, eq .

pv,eqPV pLqˆEpLq

The allowed values of h are based on the homomorphisms from M to a single edge,
hence the term hompMq-tiling. Given one such homomorphism, assign each vertex in the
image the number of vertices from M mapped to it. In fact, for any such homomorphism
the preimage of one vertex has size two, while the preimages of the other two vertices has
size three. Consequently, for any family of homomorphisms of M into a single edge the
smallest and the largest class of preimages can diﬀer by a factor of 2{3 at most and this
observation is the reason for condition (c ) in Deﬁnition 16. We also note the following.
Fact 17. There is a fractional hompMq-tiling h of the hypergraph M which has hmin ě 1{3
and weight wphq “ 8.
Proof. Let x1, x2, w1, y1, y2, w2, z1, and z2 be the vertices of M and let

x1x2w1 , w1y1y2 ,

y1y2w2 ,

and w2z1z2

be the edges of M. On the edges x1x2w1 and z1z2w2 we assign the vertex weights p1, 1, 2{3q,
where the weight 2{3 is assigned to w1 and w2. The vertex weights for edges y1y2w1 and
y1y2w2 are p1{2, 1{2, 1{3q, where w1 and w2 get the weight 1{3. It is easy to see that those
vertex weights give rise to a hompMq-tiling h on M with hmin “ 1{3 and wphq “ 8. (cid:3)
The notion hompMq-tiling is also motivated by the following proposition which shows
that such a fractional hompMq-tiling in a cluster hypergraph can be “converted” to an
integer M-tiling in the original hypergraph.

Proposition 18. Let Q be an pε, tq-regular partition of a 3-uniform, n-vertex hypergraph H
with n ą 21ε´2 and let K “ Kpε, 6ε,Qq be the corresponding cluster hypergraph. Further-
more, let h: V pKq ˆ EpKq Ñ r0, 1s be a fractional hompMq-tiling of K with hmin ě 1{3.
Then there exists an M-tiling of H which covers all but at most pwphq ´ 27tεq|V1| vertices.
Proof. We restrict our consideration to the subhypergraph K1 Ă K consisting of the
hyperedges with positive weight, i.e., e “ abc P K with hpaq, hpbq, hpcq ě hmin. For each
a P V pK1q let Va be the corresponding partition class in Q. Due to the property (b ) of
Deﬁnition 16 we can subdivide Va (arbitrarily) into a collection of pairwise disjoint sets
aqaPePK of size |U e
a| “ hpa, eq|Va|. Note that every edge e “ abc P K corresponds to
pU e
the pε, 6εq-regular triplet pVa, Vb, Vcq. Hence we obtain from the deﬁnition of regularity
and hmin ě 1{3 that the triplet pU e
cq is p3ε, 6εq-regular. From the property (c ) in
˘
`
cq incorporating at
Deﬁnition 16 and Proposition 13 we obtain an M-tiling of pU e
|Va| vertices. Applying this to all hyperedges of K1 we

obtain an M-tiling incorporating at least

vertices. Noting that |K1| ď 3t (because of hmin ě 1{3) and |Va| ě |V1| we obtain the
(cid:3)
proposition.
Owing to Proposition 18, we are given a connection between fractional hompMq-tilings
of the cluster hypergraph K of H and M-tilings in H. A vertex i P V pKq corresponds to a
class of vertices Vi in the regular partition of H. The total vertex weight hpiq essentially
translates to the proportion of vertices of Vi which can be covered by the corresponding
M-tilings in H. Consequently, wphq essentially translates to the proportion of vertices
covered by the corresponding M-tiling in H. This reduces our task to ﬁnding a fractional
hompMq-tiling with weight greater than the number of vertices previously covered in K.
The following lemma (Lemma 19), which is the main tool for the proof of Lemma 11,
follows the idea discussed above. In the proof of Lemma 11 we ﬁx a maximal M-tiling
in the cluster hypergraph K of the given hypergraph H. Owing to the minimum degree
condition of H and Proposition 15, a typical vertex in the cluster hypergraph K will be
contained in at least p7{16 ` op1qq
hyperedges of K. We will show that a typical
vertex u of K which is not covered by the maximal M-tiling of K, has the property that
p7{16 ` op1qq ¨ 64 ą 28 of the edges incident to u intersect some pair of copies of M from
the M-tiling of K. Lemma 19 asserts that two such vertices and the pair of copies of M
can be used to obtain a fractional hompMq-tiling with a weight signiﬁcantly larger than 16,
the number of vertices of the two copies of M. This lemma will come in handy in the

˘

proof of Lemma 11, where it is used to show that one can cover a higher proportion of the
vertices of H than the proportion of vertices covered by the largest M-tiling in K.

We consider a set of hypergraphs L29 deﬁnied as follows: Every L P L29 consists of two
(vertex disjoint) copies of M, say M1 and M2, and two additional vertices u and v such
that all edges incident to u or v contain precisely one vertex from V pM1q and one vertex
from V pM2q. Moreover, L satisﬁes the following properties

‚ for every a P V pM1q and b P V pM2q we have uab P EpLq iﬀ vab P EpLq
‚ degpuq “ degpvq ě 29.

Lemma 19. For every L P L29 there exists a fractional hompMq-tiling h with hmin ě 1{3
and wphq ě 16 ` 1
3.

The following proof of Lemma 19 is based on straightforward, but somewhat tedious

case distinction.
Proof. For the proof we ﬁx the following labeling of the vertices of the two disjoint copies
of M. Let
V pM1q “ tx1, x2, w1, y1, y2, w2, z1, z2u and EpM1q “
be the vertices and edges of the ﬁrst copy of M. Analogously, let
V pM2q “ tx11, x12, w11, y11, y12, w12, z11, z12u and EpM2q “
x11x12w11, w11y11y12, y11y12w12, w12z11z12
be the vertices and edges of the other copy of M (see Figure 1.a). Moreover, we set
X “ tx1, x2u, Y “ ty1, y2u, and Z “ tz1, z2u and, let X1, Y 1, and Z1 be deﬁned analogously
for M2.

The proof of Lemma 19 proceeds in two steps. First, we show that in any possible
counterexample L, the edges incident to u and v which do not contain any vertex from
tw1, w2, w11, w12u form a subgraph of K2,3,3 (see Claim 20). In the second step we show that
every edge contained in this subgraph of K2,3,3 forbids too many other edges incident to u
and v, which will yield a contradiction to the condition degpuq “ degpvq ě 29 of L (see
Claim 21).

We introduce the following notation to simplify later arguments. For a given L P L29
with M1 and M2 being the copies of M, let L be set of the pairs pa, bq P V pM1qˆ V pM2q
such that uab P EpLq. We split L into L1 Y¨ L2 according to

It will be convenient to view L1 and L2 as bipartite graphs with vertex classes V pM1q
and V pM2q.

We split the proof of Lemma 19 into the following two claims.

Claim 20. For all L P L29 without a fractional hompMq-tiling with hmin ě 1{3 and
wphq ě 16 ` 1{3, we have L1 Ď K3,3, where each of the sets X, Y , Z and X1, Y 1, Z1
contains precisely one of the vertices of the K3,3.

Claim 20 will be used in the proof of the next claim, which clearly implies Lemma 19.

Claim 21. Let F “
and for
every edge ab P L1 let Fpa, bq Ď F be the set of those e P F, whose appearance in L
(i.e. e P L2) implies the existence of a fractional hompMq-tiling h with hmin ě 1{3 and
wphq ě 16 ` 1{3. Then there is an injection f : L1 Ñ F such that fpa, bq P Fpa, bq for
every pair ab P L1.

Clearly, |F| “ 28 and L2 Ă F. Hence, from |L2| ` |fpL1q| “ |L2| ` |L1| ě 29 we
derive that L2 and fpL1q must intersect. By Claim 21 this yields the desired fractional
hompMq-tiling and Lemma 19 follows.
(cid:3)
In the proofs of Claim 20 and Claim 21 we will consider fractional hompMq-tilings h
which use vertex weights of special types. In fact, for an edge e “ a1a2a3, the weights
hpa1, eq, hpa2, eq, and hpa3, eq will be of the following forms

(a1) hpa1, eq “ hpa2, eq “ hpa3, eq “ 1

Proof of Claim 20. Given L P L29 satisfying the assumptions of the claim and with the
labeling from Figure 1.a. Observe that for any A P tX, Y, Zu, the hypergraph M1 ´ A
contains two disjoint edges. Similarly, for every B P tX1, Y 1, Z1u, M2 ´ B contains two
disjoint edges.

Figure 2. Case: ab1, ab2 P L1 with tb1, b2u P tX1, Y 1, Z1u

2.a: (a1)-edges w1y1y2, w2z1z2, and w12z11z12,
(b3)-edges ax11u and ax12v, (b1)-edge w11y11y12,
and (a3)-edge x11x12w1.

2.b: (a1)-edges w1y1y2, w2z1z2, and w12z11z12,
(b3)-edges ay11u and ay12v, (b1)-edge x11x12w11,
and (a3)-edge w11y11y12.

First we exclude the case that there is a matching ta1b1, a2b2u of size two in L1 between
some ta1, a2u “ A P tX, Y, Zu and some tb1, b2u “ B P tX1, Y 1, Z1u.
In this case we
can construct a fractional hompMq-tiling h as follows: Choose two edges ua1b1, va2b2.
Using these and the four disjoint edges in pM1 ´ Aq Y¨ pM2 ´ Bq, we obtain six disjoint
edges (see Figure 1.b). Letting all these six edges be (a1)-edges, we obtain a fractional
hompMq-tiling h with hmin “ 1 and wphq “ 18.

We show that every a P A P tX, Y, Zu has at most one neighbour in each B P tX1, Y 1, Z1u.
Assuming the contrary, let a P A P tX, Y, Zu and tb1, b2u “ B P tX1, Y 1, Z1u, with ab1,
ab2 P L1. For symmetry reasons, we only have to consider the case B “ X1 and B “ Y 1.
The case B “ Z1 is symmetric to B “ X1.
In those cases, we choose h as shown in
Figure 2.a (B “ X1) and Figure 2.b (B “ Y 1) and in either case we ﬁnd a fractional
hompMq-tiling h satisfying hmin “ 1{3 and wphq “ 16 ` 1{3. Note that the cases A “ Y

and A “ Z can be treated in the same manner since the only condition needed to deﬁne h
is that M1 ´ A contains two disjoint edges.

To show that L1 is indeed contained in a K3,3 it remains to verify that every a1b1, a2b2 with
ta1, a2u “ A P tX, Y, Zu, b1 P B1 P tX1, Y 1, Z1u, and b2 P B2 P tX1, Y 1, Z1u (cid:114) B1 guarantees
the existence of a fractional hompMq-tiling h with hmin ě 1{3 and wphq ě 16` 1{3. Again
owing to the symmetry, the only cases we need to consider are B1 “ X1, B2 “ Y 1 (see
Figure 3.a) and B1 “ X1, B2 “ Z1 (see Figure 3.b). In fact, the fractional hompMq-tilings h
given in Figure 3.a and Figure 3.b satisfy hmin ě 1{3 and wphq “ 17. Again the cases
A “ Y and A “ Z can be treated in the same manner. This concludes the proof of
(cid:3)
Claim 20.

To complete the proof of Lemma 19 it is left to prove Claim 21.

Proof of Claim 21. Before deﬁning the injection f : L1 Ñ F we collect some information
about Fpa, bq with ab P L1. Owing to Claim 20, we may assume without loss of generality
that x1, y1, z1 and x11, y11, z11 are the vertices which span all edges of L1. First we consider
e “ y1y11. As shown in Figure 4.a the appearance of w1y12 P L1 would give rise to a fractional
hompMq-tiling h with hmin ě 1{3 and wphq “ 16.5. Consequently, we have

w1y12 P Fpy1, y11q.

For the case e “ x1x11 P L1, Figure 4.b, shows that x2w11 P Fpx1, x11q and by symmetry,
it follows that

tx2w11, w1x12u Ď Fpx1, x11q .

By applying appropriate automorphisms to M1 and M2 we immediately obtain information
on Fpx1, z11q, Fpz1, x11q, and Fpz1, z11q. Indeed, we have

tx2w12, w1z12u Ď Fpx1, z11q , tw2x12, z2w11u Ď Fpz1, x11q , tz2w12, w2z12u Ď Fpz1, z11q .

edges w1y12v, y1y2w2, and w11y11y12.

4.b: (a1)-edges x1x11u, w1y1y2, and w2z1z2,
(b1)-edges x2w11v and w12z11z12, and (b2)-edges
w11y11y12 and y11y12w12.

Next we consider e “ y1x11. In this case Figure 5.a shows that y2w11 P Fpy1, x11q. Moreover,
as shown in Figure 5.b we also have w1x12 P Fpy1, x11q and, consequently, we obtain

ty2w11, w1x12u Ď Fpy1, x11q .

Again applying appropriate automorphisms to M1 and M2 we immediately obtain infor-
mation on Fpx1, y11q, Fpy1, z11q, and Fpz1, y11q. Indeed one can show

tw1y12, x2w11u Ď Fpx1, y11q , ty2w12, w1z12u Ď Fpy1, z11q , tw2y12, z2w11u Ď Fpz1, y11q .

Finally, we deﬁne an injection f : L1 Ñ F Ě L2 such that fpa, bq P Fpa, bq for every
pair ab P L1. Recall that due to Claim 20 we have L1 Ď tx1, y1, z1u ˆ tx11, y11, z11u and it

Proof of Lemma 11. Let γ ą 0 be given and we assume that there is an α ą 0 such
that for all n10 there is a 3-uniform hypergraph H on n ą n10 vertices which satisﬁes
δ1pHq ě p 7
but which does not contain an α-deﬁcient M-tiling. Let α0 be the
supremum of all such α and note that α0 is bounded away from one due to Proposition 12.
We choose ε “ pγα0{2100q2. By deﬁnition of α0, there is an n0 such that all 3-uniform
16 ` γqn have an pα0 ` εq-deﬁcient
hypergraphs H on n ą n0 vertices satisfying δ1pHq ě p 7

have an pα0 ´ εq-deﬁcient M-tiling, contradicting

the deﬁnition of α0.
We apply Proposition 15 with the constants γ, ε{12, d “ ε{2 and t15 “ maxtn0,pε{12q´3u

to obtain an n15 and T15. Let n1 ě maxtn15, n0u be suﬃciently large and let H be an
arbitrary 3-uniform hypergraph on n ą n1 vertices which satisﬁes δ1pHq ě p 7
but
which does not contain an α0-deﬁcient M-tiling. We apply Proposition 15 to H with the
constants chosen above and obtain a cluster hypergraph K “ Kpε{12, ε{2,Qq on t ą t15
vertices which satisﬁes δ1pKq ě p 7

we know by the deﬁnition of α0 and by Proposition 22 that M is an α1-deﬁcient M-tiling
of K, for some α1 ď α0 ` 26?

We claim that M is not pα0{2q-deﬁcient and for a contradiction, assume the contrary.
Then, from Fact 17, we know that for each Mj P M there is a fractional hompMq-tiling hj

Note that the ﬁrst part of (9) trivially holds since in the opposite case, using the ﬁrst

are at least four vertices, say v1, . . . , v4, and at least p3 ` εq

intersect these vertices. Hence, there exists a pair x1, x2 such that tx1, x2, viu P H for all

tx3, x4, viu P H for i “ 1, . . . , 4. For each vi we can ﬁnd another edge from B containing vi,
keeping them all mutually disjoint and also disjoint from tx1, x2u and tx3, x4u. This is
possible since each vi is contained in more than 13|X| edges from B. This, however, yields
two copies of M which contradicts the fact that M was a largest possible M-tiling. (cid:3)
The set X will be used to show that there is an L P L29 such that K contains many

Proof. We consider the 3-uniform hypergraph C (as given from Claim 23) on the vertex
set X Y M . Note that for ﬁxed ij a vertex x is contained in at most 64 ij-crossing edges,
thus there are at most 264 diﬀerent hypergraphs with the property that x is contained
in at least 29 edges which are ij-crossing. We colour each edge xij by one of the 264
colours, depending on the 3-partite hypergraph induced on x, Mi, andMj. On the one
hand, we observe that a monochromatic tight path consisting of the two edges xij, x1ij P C
corresponds to a copy of L. On the other hand, Claim 23 implies that there is a colour
such that at least

path gives rise to at least α0γt{275 pairwise vertex disjoint tight paths on four vertices

Proposition 25. For all d and β ą 0 there exist ε ą 0, integers p and m0 such that for

With this result at hand one can easily derive the path-tiling lemma (Lemma 10) from

the M-tiling lemma (Lemma 11).
