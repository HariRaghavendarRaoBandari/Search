ABSTRACT

Two new ON supergiant spectra (bringing the total known to seven) and
one new ONn giant (total of this class now eight) are presented; they have been
discovered by the Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey. These rare objects rep-
resent extremes in the mixing of CNO-cycled material to the surfaces of evolved,
late-O stars, by uncertain mechanisms in the ﬁrst category but likely by rotation
in the second. The two supergiants are at the hot edge of the class, which is a
selection eﬀect from the behavior of deﬁning N iii and C iii absorption blends,
related to the tendency toward emission (Of eﬀect) in the former. An additional

N/C criterion ﬁrst proposed by Bisiacchi et al. is discussed as a means to al-
leviate that eﬀect, and it is relevant to the two new objects. The entire ON
supergiant class is discussed; they display a fascinating diversity of detail un-
doubtedly related to the complexities of their extended atmospheres and winds
that are sensitive to small diﬀerences in physical parameters, as well as to bi-
nary eﬀects in some cases. Serendipitously, we have found signiﬁcant variability
in the spectrum of a little-known hypergiant with normal N, C spectra selected
as a comparison for the anomalous objects. In contrast to the supergiants, the
ONn spectra are virtual (nitrogen)-carbon copies of one another except for the
degrees of line broadening, which emphasizes their probable unique origin and
hence amenability to deﬁnitive astrophysical interpretation.

Introduction

The visibility of material processed by their own interior nuclear reactions at the sur-
faces of stars is a remarkable diagnostic that will contribute to unique deﬁnitions of their
evolutionary status and histories, once the complex mechanisms involved can be identi-
ﬁed and understood. An inverse N/C,O dichotomy in certain OB spectra was announced
and discussed by Walborn (1971, 1976). Unfortunately, reliable quantitative analysis of
these spectra has lagged those results by decades, because of the complexity of especially
the supergiant atmospheres and winds; only recently have thorough analyses of substantial
samples begun to appear (e.g., Rivero Gonz´alez et al. 2011, 2012a,b; Bouret et al. 2012;
Martins et al. 2015a,b). There is a growing consensus that the rare extreme cases of the
phenomenon bracket systematic trends of nitrogen enrichment among massive stars, such
that, e.g., the majority of morphologically normal OB supergiants are physically enhanced,
while the OBC and OBN spectra correspond to opposite extremes, as originally suggested by
Walborn (1976). Of course, that can be established only quantitatively, not only because of
the range of degrees, but also because morphological detection of even extreme cases depends
on the availability of suitable criteria, which is nonuniform and produces selection eﬀects.

The Galactic O-Star Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS; Ma´ız Apell´aniz et al. 2011) ambi-
tiously proposes to observe the blue-violet spectra of every accessible O star in the Galaxy,
i.e., a few thousand, with homogeneous resolving power (∼2500) and signal-to-noise (∼200).
Nearly 450 veriﬁed or new classiﬁcations have already been published (Sota et al. 2011,
2014; Papers I & II, respectively) and about as many more are in progress. Such a project

– 3 –

is guaranteed to reveal new categories of spectra as well as individual objects of special
interest, and that has already occurred (Walborn et al. 2010, 2011). The ﬁrst of those ref-
erences addresses curious diﬀerences in the relative intensities of N iii and C iii emission
features among Of spectra, which may or may not be related to chemical abundances since
selective excitation eﬀects are involved. The second expands upon the ONn category of
nitrogen-enhanced, rapidly rotating, late-O giant spectra, further increased by one in this
paper. Two new ON supergiants are likewise signiﬁcant because of their rarity and the need
to disentangle possibly multiple physical mechanisms within the category. Thus, these three
new objects are presented and discussed in their respective contexts here, along with some
related developments in their classiﬁcation criteria. The new objects will be included in
the next installment of the GOSSS classiﬁcation lists (Ma´ız Apell´aniz et al. 2016, in press;
Paper III).

2. Observations

Spectroscopic observations of all stars but two discussed here have been obtained with
the Boller & Chivens spectrograph attached to the 2.5m du Pont telescope at the Las Cam-
panas Observatory (LCO) in Chile. The Marconi No. 1 2048 × 515 13.5µ-pixel detector was
in use with that instrument. We used a 1200 lines mm−1 grating centered at 4700 ˚A and had
the slit width set to 150 microns, corresponding to 1.′′26 on the sky and 1.75 pixels on the
detector. This instrumental conﬁguration produces a resolution of ∼1.7 ˚A as measured from
the FWHM of the comparison lines. The typical peak signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per 2-pixel
resolution element ranges from 150 to 200, with just a few cases signiﬁcantly below or above.
Dome ﬂats and bias frames were obtained during the afternoon prior to each observing night
as well as twilight ﬂats at sunset, and He-Ne-Ar comparison-lamp exposures were recorded
before or after each target was observed. All of these data pertain to the Galactic O-Star
Spectroscopic Survey (GOSSS; Ma´ız Apell´aniz et al. 2011). They have been adjusted to the
uniform survey resolving power of 2500 and are incorporated into the GOSSS database.

HD 191781 and BD +36◦ 4063 in the northern hemisphere were observed with the
Albireo spectrograph at the 1.5m reﬂector of the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada (OSN),
Granada, Spain. The 1800 lines mm−1 grating provided a spectral scale of 0.62 ˚A per pixel.
Further details of these data are given by Sota et al. (2011, 2014).

3. Results

3.1. The ON Supergiants

The blue-violet spectra of the seven ON supergiants are displayed in order of advancing
spectral type in Figure 1, together with morphologically normal and OC supergiants below
for comparison. Data for these objects are listed in Table 1, in the same order as the ﬁgure.

3.1.1. The Spectra of HDE 323110 and 328209

The two new members have somewhat earlier types (higher temperatures), which at
ﬁrst glance had excluded them from the category. That is because the original deﬁnition of
an ON star required the N iii λλ4634–4640–4642 absorption blend (hereafter “λ4640”) to
be stronger than C iii λλ4647–4650–4652 (“λ4650”), which is not the case in these spectra.
However, the other N III features are exceedingly strong, including the λλ4511–4515 blend
discussed later as an additional criterion for the class, and especially λ4097 in the shortward
wing of Hδ. C iii is also signiﬁcantly weaker than normal. The relative weakness of λ4640
is a result of ﬁlling by the Of selective emission, which increases toward earlier types (and
higher luminosities), resulting in a strong selection of the ON classiﬁcation toward the latest
O types. We have three observations of HDE 328209, from 2011 March 24, 2013 May 30,
and 2014 April 26, among which all spectral features are essentially identical; the second of
these is shown in Fig. 1.

The exact spectral types of these two stars are not well deﬁned due to somewhat con-
ﬂicting criteria. Both the He ii λ4200/He i λ4144 and He ii λ4541/He i λ4387 ratios should
have values of unity at type O9, increasing toward earlier and decreasing toward later types.
However, in both of these spectra the ﬁrst of those ratios is slightly larger (tending toward
type O8.5) while the latter is slightly smaller (type O9.2; Sota et al. 2014). Thus, the com-
promise typeO9 is adopted for both. In the ﬁrst ratio, the discrepancy is most likely caused
by blending with enhanced N iii λλ4196, 4200. In addition, HDE 323110 is an SB2, with
blended, shortward secondary components visible at the He i lines in Fig. 1.

Unfortunately, the luminosity classes of the two spectra are likewise problematic.
HDE 323110 appears to have a very weak P Cyg proﬁle at the principal criterion He ii λ4686,
which is consistent with class Ia. (An alternative interpretation could be a blend of lines from
the two SB components, weaker in the longward spectrum which would still indicate Ia.) In
contrast, in HDE 328209, the λ4686 absorption (which weakens with increasing luminosity
also due to the Of eﬀect) is only slightly weaker than He i λ4713, which calls for class Ib,

in substantial disagreement with the exceedingly strong Si iv λλ4089, 4116 absorptions that
are appropriate for Ia. Hence, only a relatively indeterminate luminosity class of I can be
assigned to this spectrum.

A further interesting feature of these spectra is the prominent quartet of weak, similarly
spaced absorption lines near λ4000. Its bookends are the usual N ii λ3995 and He i λ4009,
which are at the low-ionization extreme of these spectra, while the two intermediate lines,
favored by the ionization and nitrogen enhancement, are N iii λλ3999, 4004 that have sim-
ilar intensities to the outer two for those reasons. This conﬁguration can be recognized
in the other ON I spectra brieﬂy discussed next, albeit with diﬀering relative intensities
corresponding to their respective spectral types.

There is also interesting prior and current external information about both of these stars.
The anomalous N/C spectra of HDE 323110 (= LSS 4103) were accurately ﬁrst reported
by Vijapurkar & Drilling (1993); our later recognition of this characteristic is independent
and thus conﬁrmatory of theirs. Moreover, in agreement with the above description of line
proﬁles in our spectrogram, the OWN Survey (Barb´a et al. 2010) has discovered that this
object is a short-period, eclipsing, interacting SB2, which will be presented in the context
of that program. HDE 328209 was reported to be a runaway star by Moﬀat et al. (1998) on
the basis of HIPPARCOS data.

3.1.2. Other ON I Stars

All of the known ON supergiants are included in Fig. 1 for comparison with the two new
ones; some of their characteristics are brieﬂy described here. While on the one hand they
constitute a homogeneous spectroscopic category, on the other when examined closely they
show considerable diversity of detail, and some of them may have diverse physical natures.
They are ordered by the He ii λ4541/Si iii λ4552 classiﬁcation ratio, the unit value of which
deﬁnes spectral type O9.7, although some range is allowed.

HD 123008 is the earliest/hottest of these spectra, both by that criterion and by the two
He ii/He i horizontal classiﬁcation ratios discussed above in the context of the new objects.
Actually, those ratios display the same small discrepancy shown by the new members, likely
for the same reason, and arguably this spectrum could be classiﬁed the same, but it will not
be revised here. Martins et al. (2015b) derive log(N/H) + 12 = 9.1 in this spectrum, and
N/C = 61 by number. The corresponding values in the Sun are 7.9 and 0.25, respectively,
as cited by Evans et al. (2004). Some other quantitative results as available will be noted
below for comparison.

– 8 –

HDE 269896 is a hypergiant in the Large Magellanic Cloud (MV − 8.1) and displays
several remarkable features related to its extreme luminosity that are unique among this set.
Most notable is the strong He ii λ4686 emission line that is very rare at such a late O type.
The range of ionizations in emission is also noteworthy, as discussed by Corti et al. (2009),
from N ii through Hβ to the He II line, probably indicating a very extended atmosphere. It
is interesting to note in the present context that λ4640 is not stronger than λ4650 in this
spectrum, either, but that is due to the high luminosity rather than to a higher temperature
as in the new members. Evans et al. (2004) quote log(N/H) + 12 = 8.3 and N/C = 7.9 for
this object, but Corti et al. (2009) found that increasing the former value to 8.9 together with
other small parameter changes provides a far better ﬁt to the observed spectrum, including
emission vs. absorption features. Sanduleak (Sk) −66◦ 169 also in the LMC has a very
similar O9.7 Ia+ spectrum except with morphologically normal CNO spectra; for it Evans
et al. (2004) derive corresponding values of 7.95 and 4.5, while quoting LMC H ii region
values of 7.1 and 0.13, respectively, for comparison.

HD 105056 and BD +36◦ 4063 may be the jokers in this deck. The former is possi-
bly a low-gravity subdwarf, because of its large distance from the Galactic plane, which
would be even more extreme if it had a Population I supergiant luminosity (Walborn et al.
1980). The latter is a known SB undergoing active mass transfer (Williams et al. 2009)
and its spectrum is signiﬁcantly variable; HDE 323110 may be a similar system. The unit
He ii λ4686/He i λ4713 ratio in our observation of BD +36◦ 4063 corresponds to luminosity
class II in normal spectra.

HD 191781 lies at the extreme late/cool edge of the O9.7 type, almost but not quite B0.
The spectral analysis of Martins et al. (2015b) yields log(N/H) + 12 = 8.9 and N/C > 15
in this object.

3.1.3. Morphologically Normal and OC Supergiants

HD 173010 is a highly luminous object; the intensities of the Si iv absorption lines are
unprecedented, leading to the Ia+ classiﬁcation despite the lack of He ii λ4686 emission as
in HDE 269896. Nevertheless, its C, N spectra are morphologically normal, so it is displayed
here as a comparison for the anomalous objects. The N iii lines are very strong, except for
λ4640 which must be ﬁlled in. But C iii is also extremely strong, cf. λ4650. Perhaps this star
had a lower initial rotational velocity than those above? The long-unidentiﬁed S iv emission
lines at λλ4485, 4503 (Werner & Rauch 2001) are also extremely strong. One wonders if the
metal abundances might be supersolar in this object toward the inner Galaxy.

– 9 –

Surprisingly, we have found that the spectral type and (not independently) the Si ion-
ization of HD 173010 are variable. Two observations are shown in Fig. 1, from 2009 April 20
(upper) and 2009 July 24 (lower). From the He ii λ4541/Si iii λ4552 classiﬁcation ratio,
the ﬁrst spectral type is O9.7, similarly to the adjacent HD 191781, but the second is sub-
stantially later and must be classiﬁed as B0 (cf. the atlas of standards in Sota et al. 2011).
Concurrently, the Si iv/Si iii ionization ratio changes in the same sense, an eﬀect we have not
seen previously. Note also the asymmetrical broad emission wings at Hβ, as discussed and
explained in several B hypergiants and Luminous Blue Variables by Walborn et al. (2015);
this proﬁle also appears somewhat variable. Further temporally resolved investigation of this
object is underway at high spectral resolution in the OWN survey. Clearly, we still have
much to learn about massive stellar atmospheres and evolution.

The OC supergiant HD 104565 is the antithesis of the ON: all the C iii features are
exceedingly strong, while N iii is vanishingly weak for the spectral type. The deﬁciency of
λ4097 between Si iv λ4089 and Hδ is especially striking and is the hallmark of the class;
even in normal spectra it is comparable to the Si iv line. If the initial rotational velocity is
a prime cause of mixing, then it must have been extremely low in this star. Martins et al.
(2016, in preparation) derive log(N/H) + 12 = 8.3 and N/C < 1.0 in this spectrum.

For comparison with the earlier spectral types of the two new ON supergiants, we cite
Figure 11 of Sota et al. (2011), which presents a complete luminosity sequence of O9 spectra
with morphologically normal CNO. They include α Cam, O9 Ia, for which Martins et al.
(2015a) derive log(N/H) + 12 = 8.4 and N/C = 5. Then we also call attention to HD 152249,
OC9 Iab, in Figure 6 of Sota et al. (2014), for which Martins et al. (2015a) derive correspond-
ing values of 8.1 and 0.46, respectively, again in perfect agreement with the morphological
predictions.

3.2. A New ONn Giant

The ONn class of nitrogen-enhanced, rapidly rotating late-O giants was extensively
discussed by Walborn et al. (2011), following its augmentation from the GOSSS data. It
is remarkably homogeneous, comprising a very small range of spectral types among which
the principal variable is the high projected rotational velocity, which in combination with
the nitrogen enhancement has striking progressive morphological eﬀects on the λλ4640–4650
blends. The purpose of this section is simply to add a further member to the class, HD 89625,
ON9.2 IVn, discovered subsequently by GOSSS. Here it has been incorporated into Figure 2,
which is the updated Figure 1 of Walborn et al. (2011).
Its location corresponds to its
relative v sin i in ascending order, between HD 150574 (∼200 km s−1) and HD 13268/91651

(∼300 km s−1). This seamless interpolation again emphasizes the internal morphological
consistency of the class, which likely corresponds to a uniform physical origin. Unfortunately,
there are no quantitative spectroscopic data available for the little known HD 89625,1 which
is not even included in the OWN survey yet. For comparison with the values in Table 2 of
Walborn et al. (2011), its Galactic latitude is −2.4◦.

The mechanisms producing diﬀerent degrees of processed material at the surfaces of
OB stars are a subject of intense current debate. Most of the ONn spectra have recently
been analyzed quantitatively and further discussed by Martins et al. (2015b). Perhaps the
most vexing variable is the unobservable initial rotational velocity, which can be inferred
only uncertainly and even somewhat circularly from evolutionary models. In the ONn class,
however, the nitrogen enhancement is very likely related to the current rotational velocity.
As discussed by Walborn et al. (2011) and Martins et al. (2015b), a high fraction of the class
are spectroscopic binaries, and some are runaways, suggesting a mechanism involving binary
evolution. This is an obvious problem ripe for intensive theoretical investigation with the
hope of a well deﬁned solution.

4. Discussion

4.1. Some Statistics

To date (January 2016) GOSSS has observed a total of nearly 900 O stars, for 590
of which reviewed or new spectral classiﬁcations have been or are about to be published
(Sota et al. 2011, 2014; Ma´ız Apell´aniz et al. 2016, in press). The former total includes
56 with spectral types in the ranges O9–O9.7 Ib-Ia, of which 7 are ON and 4 OC; and
74 in the ranges O8.5–O9.7 IV–II(n)–nn, of which 8 are ON and none OC. Thus, the ON
supergiants comprise 12.5% of the total in their spectral-type ranges, and the ONn giants
11% of their ranges. Of course, the “normal” samples exhibit diﬀering degrees of mixed
processed material, including nitrogen-strong (Nstr) and nitrogen-weak (Nwk) spectra that
are less extreme than the ON/OC, and in particular a majority with some degree of mixing

1This circumstance is likely related to the misclassiﬁcation of B3/B4 (V) from the Michigan HD catalogue
quoted (with a slight variation) by SIMBAD. A hypothesis for this error can be advanced: the weak,
broadened He ii lines were missed on the photographic objective-prism plate, while the diﬀerence between
the He i spectrum and its maximum at type B2 was applied in the wrong direction. As reported in VizieR,
B. Skiﬀ (Catalogue of Stellar Spectral Classiﬁcations) has found that the original HD classiﬁcation of B was
upgraded to a relatively accurate B0 on the Extension chart.

– 12 –

among the supergiants (see Walborn 1976). The extreme ON/OC spectra are small tails of
the overall distributions.

4.2. A New Classiﬁcation Criterion for Somewhat Hotter ON I Spectra

As discussed early in the history of the OBN/OBC classiﬁcation dichotomy (Walborn
1976), the recognition of such morphological anomalies is nonuniform in the HRD, depending
upon the available features and their normal two-dimensional (temperature, luminosity) be-
havior. The λλ4640–4650 absorption blends in late-O supergiants provide a prime example.
In normal spectra, the longward C iii blend is much stronger than the adjacent, shortward
N iii. When the latter becomes the stronger in the rare ON spectra, a striking anomaly
results (Fig. 1). When the two are about equal, the “Nstr” notation is used. However, this
criterion functions optimally only in the restricted O9.2–B0.5 range. At later types, ﬁrst
the N iii and then the C iii become too weak and are dominated by O ii blends at the
same wavelengths. Toward earlier types, the issue is the progressive ﬁlling in of the N iii
absorption by the Of emission eﬀect, such that it never exceeds the C iii even for comparable
or greater N enhancements. Thus, a strong selection eﬀect in the ON classiﬁcation arises. It
is interesting to note that it also applies to the even rarer case of luminosity exceeding Ia, as
in HDE 269896 with He ii λ4686 in emission despite the late-O spectral type; that has been
compensated in its ON classiﬁcation even though the N iii absorption is only comparable to
the C iii.

Here we have introduced that same compensation for somewhat hotter supergiants,
namely HDE 323110 and 328209, in which the two blends are again comparable, while other
N iii absorption features are abnormally intense and C iii is deﬁcient, as already described
above. Actually, this development has recently been anticipated by the ON8 III((f)) classi-
ﬁcation of VFTS 819 in 30 Doradus (Walborn et al. 2014, Fig. 22) although λ4640 is nearly
neutral. Note that other N iii absorption features in its spectrum, including λλ4511–4515,
are stronger than in the somewhat more luminous O8 spectra adjacent to it in the ﬁgure.

The possible relevance of λλ4511–4515 as an additional indicator of N enhancement
was discussed long ago by Bisiacchi et al. (1982). While their discrimination of the feature’s
normal two-dimensional behavior was not entirely satisfying, their proposal deserves recon-
sideration in the present context. It would indeed be interesting if accurate quantitative EW
measurements of this feature might reveal smaller, continuous degrees of N enhancement
relative to the normal trends over a wider range of O types, as they discussed. Perhaps
its ratio to C iii λ4650 would provide even higher sensitivity. As a start, we provide such
measurements in Table 1 for the spectra in Figure 1. It is encouraging that the ratios show

monotonic discrimination among the ON, normal, and OC spectra in the expected sense: the
ON range (which may well be real) runs from 0.83 to 2.35 with a mean of 1.48 ± 0.19 (m.e.),
while the normal spectrum yields 0.4 and the OC 0.15. Those ratios can be derived from the
measurements of Bisiacchi et al. for 8 supergiants with the classiﬁcations of which as such we
agree (in a number of other cases they list as supergiants objects that are giants in our sys-
tem; note also their typo for HD 202124): α Cam, 0.43; ζ Ori, 0.15; HD 75222, 0.19; µ Nor,
0.08; HD 152249, 0.10; HD 202124, 0.41; 19 Cep, 0.22; HD 225146, 0.10. Of these, ζ Ori is
Nwk and HD 152249 is OC, while we consider the remainder to have morphologically normal
CNO. Thus there is good to excellent agreement with our measurements in most cases, with
the exceptions of µ Nor and HDE 225146, which have values appropriate for OC while their
spectral appearance is compatible with normal CNO, albeit perhaps at the low-N side of
the range. Bisiacchi et al. consider the full O-type spectral grid, not just the small range of
this paper. Walborn et al. (2014, Figures 13 and 15) described the O6.5 V((f))z spectra of
VFTS 089 and 761 as Nstr based on the unusual strength of λλ4511–4515 and other N iii
lines for that spectral type. Of course, these measurements should be undertaken in the
extensive, full GOSSS sample to establish the normal trends and individual deviations from
them. Such is beyond the scope of this study but shall be pursued in the future.
