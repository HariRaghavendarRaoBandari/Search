In the present work, we study the ﬂow of thixotropic yield stress ﬂuids between two concentric
cylinders. In order to take into account the thixotropy, the constitutive relation uses a structural
parameter which is driven by a kinetic equation. Here, the Houska’s model is considered. Depending
on the breakdown rate of the structural parameter, localization or shear-banding are observed.
We show that for fragile structures, a shear-banding ﬂow may be observed although for stronger
structures, only localisation of the ﬂow is observed such as in Bingham ﬂuids. Physical explanations
of the shear-banding discussed by several authors in the literature highlight that the shear-banding
may be associated with a discontinuity into the structure of the material and a non-monotonic
evolution of the stress according to the constitutive relation with the strain rate. Solving numerically
the ﬂow, we show that such a rheological model based on the existence of a structural parameter is
able to predict shear-banding. Moreover, the consequences of the thixotropy on the linear stability
of the azimuthal ﬂow is studied in a large range of parameters. Although the thixotropy allows
shear banding for the base ﬂow, it does not modify fundamentaly the stability of the Couette
ﬂow compared to a simple yield stress ﬂuid. The apparent shear-thinning behaviour depends on
the thixotropic parameters of the ﬂuid and the results about the onset of the Taylor vortices in
shear-thinning ﬂuids are retrieved. Nevertheless, the shear-banding modiﬁes the stratiﬁcation of
the viscosity in the ﬂowing zone such that the critical conditions are mainly driven by the width of
the ﬂowing region.

INTRODUCTION

2

Shear banding occurs in many complex materials which manifest non-linear rheological behavior such as micellar
solutions, granular paste or colloidal gels [1]. It has been shown that the coexistence of static and ﬂowing regions can
be associated with the existence of a yield stress which is often related to the existence of a rigid network between the
elements of the ﬂuid which has to be broken for the system starts to ﬂow. Shear banding occurs, in many cases, in
systems which exhibit a competition between at least two mechanisms: a breakdown process due to an external applied
shear and a spontaneous restructuring of the ﬂuid due to the non-linear interaction between its elements [2]. This
feature suggests that the onset of shear banding is related to a coupling between the constitutive law of the material
and the evolution of its internal structure. However questions remain on the quantitative eﬀects of such a structure
parameter on the behavior of the ﬂow and its stability. The structure parameter represents some physical properties
of the instantaneous structure state of the ﬂuid. The constitutive law depends on this structural parameter whose
evolution is driven by a kinetic equation. In this picture, thixotropy models [3–5] such as Houska’s model are relevant
to predict ﬂow instabilities and heterogeneities in complex structured ﬂuids. Ovarlez et al. 2009 [6] and Coussot &
Ovarlez 2010 [7] recently discuss the physical origin of shear localization and shear banding in complex ﬂuids. Authors
highlight the existence of a discontinuity of the shear rate proﬁle during shear banding contrary to shear localization
where the shear rates goes to zero continuously as one approaches the static region. In the last case, the shear rate
is zero on both side of the static and ﬂowing regions. ”Shear localization” refers to a stress heterogeneity inherent
to the geometry for a yield stress ﬂuid whereas ”shear banding” is directly related to the non-linear rheology of the
material. The onset of shear banding or shear localization highly depends on the stress distribution. Analysing in
depth these phenomenon needs a control of that distribution. In that context, Couette ﬂows are particularly relevant
to study these phenomena since the shear stress distribution is heterogeneous but well controlled contrary to cone or
plate geometry. Taylor-Couette ﬂow is often used in rheology as a reference shear ﬂow. Moreover, since the historical
work of Taylor [8], it is a paradigm for studies of stabilities and transition to turbulence. With Newtonian ﬂuids,
the transitional regimes observed in Taylor-Couette ﬂows have been widely studied [9] when the inner or the outer
cylinders rotates. In the present work, we only consider the case where the inner cylinder rotates at a given angular
velocity ωi such as the velocity at the inner radius ri is vi = ωiri (ﬁg. 1). The outer cylinder is static.
In this
conﬁguration, when the velocity of the inner cylinder is suﬃciently low, the purely azimuthal steady ﬂow is stable
for viscous ﬂuids [8–11]. One can notice that an elastic instability of the ﬂow may occurs even at very low velocity
[12] for non-Newtonanian ﬂuids. According to the studies of the hydrodynamic stability of shear-thinning [11, 13]
and Bingham ﬂuids [11, 14, 15] in Couette ﬂow, it is observed that when the viscosity is scaled with the inner wall
shear-viscosity, shear-thinning has a stabilizing eﬀect, i. e. the appearance of the Taylor-vortices is delayed. For a
Bingham ﬂuid, the dependence of the wavelength of the Taylor vortices to the yield stress changes when a non-yielded
zone appears close to the outer cylinder. Chen et al. [15] have shown that the eﬀects of yield stress on the energy
transient growth and ﬂow structure of the optimal perturbations are quite diﬀerent for the wide or narrow-gap cases.
Considering axisymmetric optimal modes for corotating cylinders, the peak of the amplitude of optimal perturbation
is found to be shifted toward the inner cylinder with increasing yield stress for the wide-gap case whereas the peak is
shifted toward the outer cylinder for the narrow-gap case. Three dimensional perturbations were also investigated in
[11] but it was found that the most unstable modes are axisymmetric, even for very strong shear-thinning ﬂuids.

Certainly, Taylor vortices do occur in yield stress ﬂuids. This is evidenced by the numerical experiments of Lock-
ett et al. (1992) [16], Coronado-Matutti, Souza Mendes & Carvalho (2004) [17] and Jeng & Zhu (2010) [18], by
phenomenological evidence from applications such as oil well drilling (i.e. observed changes in frictional pressure),
and also by only few direct experimental studies. Nouar, Devienne & Lebouche (1987) [19] and Naimi, Devienne
& Lebouche (1990) [20] have studied axial ﬂow through an annulus with rotating inner cylinder, using CMC and
Carbopol solutions, respectively. The former behaves as a power-law ﬂuid and the latter has a yield stress, as well
as shear-thinning behaviour. In both cases only axisymmetric Taylor vortices are reported, with their appearance
retarded by the presence of an axial ﬂow. Naimi et al. (1990) [20] reports that the yield stress appears to stabilize
the ﬂow. Fardin et al.
[21] show experimental evidences of Taylor-like vortices in shear-banding ﬂow of giant mi-
celles. This observation suggests that the Taylor-vortices can commonly occur in a very large range of thixotropic or
non-thixotropic non-Newtonian ﬂuids.

In this article, we propose a numerical study of the stationary ﬂow of a thixotropic yield stress ﬂuid in a Couette
conﬁguration. For modelling steady state ﬂows, we use the Houska’s model where the constitutive law depends on
a structural parameter driven by a kinetic equation.It is commonly admitted in the litterature [22] that a diﬀusion
term is recquired to model shear banding. We show, in this article, that the stress selection at the interface by the
structural diﬀusion term admits a limit value equals to the yield stress of the fully structured ﬂuid when the structural
diﬀusion coeﬃcient tends to zero. We show that the inherent thixotropy of the model controls the transition from a
solution where a static and a ﬂowing regions coexists in which the shear rate proﬁle is continuous (shear localization)
to a solution where the two regions coexist but in which the shear rate proﬁle is discontinuous (shear banding). We

show that the onset of shear banding is controled by the competition between restructuring eﬀects and breakdown
eﬀects due to the ﬂow. Although the thixotropy initiates shear banding in the base ﬂow, a linear analysis of the
stability of ﬂow solutions shows that the nature of the linear unstable mode which is steady and axisymmetric in a
large range of explored parameters does not depend on the thixotropic character of the ﬂow.

II. CONSTITUTIVE EQUATIONS AND NUMERICAL APPROACH

A. Modiﬁed Houska’s model

The Houska’s model [23, 24] is built from the Hershel-Bulkley model, commonly used for non-elastic yield stress
ﬂuids, considering that the consistency K and the yield stress τ0 depend linearly on the structural parameter λ. Thus,
for a non-zero strain rate, i. e. ˆ˙γ (cid:54)= 0, the stress tensor ˆτ is given by :

The parameters ∆K and τ1 determine the sensitivity of the consistency and the yield stress respectively with the
structural parameter λ. nc is the shear thinning index. The second invariant of the strain rate tensor ˆ˙γ is deﬁned by

using the Einstein summation convention where the elements of the strain tensor ˆ˙γij = ∂ˆvi/∂ ˆxj + ∂ˆvj/∂ ˆxi are deﬁned
with the components of the ﬂuid velocity ˆv. The indices i and j stand for the cylindrical coordinates r, θ and z (ﬁg.
1) and the hat ˆ. denotes a dimensional variable. According Olmsted et al.
[22], a stress diﬀusion has to be added
to keep the unicity of the steady solution in case of shear-banding by selecting the stress at the interface between
the bands. Fardin et al. [25] show that the length based on this stress diﬀusion is at the order of magnitude of the
molecular size in wormlike micelles. Thus, the structural parameter λ is determined by the kinetic equation :

(3)

D is the structural diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The diﬀusion term in eq. (3) has been added to the original version of Houska’s
model to take into account the stress diﬀusion, via the structural diﬀusion, in our model. a and b are respectively
the building and the breakdown parameters. The thixotropic breakdown index m is taken equal to 1 in the following.
The values of the structural parameter are within the range 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1. The value λ = 1 means that the ﬂuid is fully
structured and, at the opposite, λ = 0 means that it is fully unstructured. The evolving dynamics of the stress is
governed by the equation (3).

B. Nondimensional equations

To non-dimensionalize the constitutive equations of the ﬂow in a cylindrical Couette geometry, we choose the

following references for the density, the velocity and the length, respectively:

ρref = ρ,

vref = vi,

lref = d,

(4)

where ρ is the density of the ﬂuid. For the non-Newtonian ﬂuids, several choices may be done for the reference
viscosity. The choice of the reference viscosity will be discussed in the section V. The reference viscosity is the plastic
viscosity of the ﬂuid at the given reference strain rate vi/d. When the strain rate is vi/d, the corresponding structural
parameter λref is given by eq. (3) at equilibrium:

where the nondimensional building and breakdown parameters are

a(cid:63) =

and b(cid:63) = b

a + b(vi/d)m =

1 + b(cid:63)/a(cid:63)

(5)

(6)

respectively. Thus, the reference viscosity built using the reference strain rate reads :

µref = µ0(1 + ∆K (cid:63)λref )

(7)
where µ0 = K(vi/d)nc−1 can be recognized as the standard reference viscosity of a power law ﬂuid. ∆K (cid:63) = ∆K/K is
the reduced thixotropic consistency factor. This parameter characterizes the dependence of the plastic viscosity with
the inner structure of the ﬂuid in comparison with the intrinsic consistency K which depends on the solvent. The
reference viscosity µref depends on the ratio of the breakdown parameter b(cid:63) over the building parameter a(cid:63). The
reference viscosity decreases when the ratio b(cid:63)/a(cid:63) increases, i. e. when the inner structure of the ﬂuid becomes more
and more fragile.

Using the previous reference dimensions, the Navier-Stokes and mass conservation equations for incompressible

ﬂuids are :

where v = ˆv/vi stands for the reduced velocity and p = ˆp/(ρv2

modiﬁed pressure including the hydrostatic pressure. The Reynolds number is deﬁned using the reference viscosity
(7) by:

Re =

Re0

1 + ∆K (cid:63)λref

where Re0 =

(10)

Thus, the reduced stress tensor reads:

(11)

where ˙γ and ˙γ are the nondimensional strain rate and strain tensor, τ (cid:63)
1 = τ1/τ0 is the reduced thixotropic yield stress.
The equation (11) involves the Bingham number which is the ratio between the yield stress and the plastic viscous
stress:

where Bn0 =

is the standard Bingham number of a Hershel-Bulkley ﬂuid. For a strong yield stress behavior, the Bingham number
is high and localized ﬂows are expected. According the equation (11), the reduced yield stress is:

For the structural parameter, the non-dimensional version of the equation (3) is:

with η = ri/re the radii ratio.

The velocity vector v is written in the cylindrical basis as v = vrer + vθeθ + vzez. We only consider the case where

the inner cylinder rotates and the outer cylinder is ﬁxed. Thus, the boundary conditions are:

• At the inner radius r = ri, the velocity components are vθ = 1 and vr = vz = 0.
• At the outer radius of the ﬂowing zone r = ro, the velocity components are vr = vθ = vz = 0.
• In our case, there is a material limit at r = re. Thus, the outer radius ro is given by the following criterion:
If τ (re) ≥ τy, ro = re, else, τ (ro) = τy.
• If D(cid:63) (cid:54)= 0, ∂λ/∂r = 0 at r = ri and r = re.

At r = ro, the yield stress τy given by eq. (13) becomes

with λo the structural parameter at the interface. Thus, the last boundary condition becomes τ (ro) = τyo and the
stress τyo at the interface is deﬁned by eq. (18). Nevertheless, the stress condition at the interface between the ﬂuid
and solid-like zone is well deﬁned only if the structural parameter λ is continuous across the interface. When the shear
banding appears, the structural parameter λ is sharply discontinuous across the interface when no diﬀusive gradient

term is added (D(cid:63) = 0) in the governing equation of λ and thus the yield stress can not be well deﬁned (Olmsted et
al. [22] and Lu et al. [26] in 2000). Authors showed that a spatially local model, i. e. without any diﬀusive gradient
of the stress (diﬀusive term for the structural parameter in our case), will not correctly predict a shear banded state.
The steady state depends then on the ﬂow/numerical noise history because it will select arbitrary a stress value at
the interface. When adding a diﬀusive term, the continuity of the yield stress or the structural parameter across the
interface is ensured. This kind of diﬀusive term has been recently interpret as a non-local eﬀect at the molecular
scale in ﬂow of micellar suspensions in [25]. As the value of the stress diﬀusion coeﬃcient, similar to the structural
diﬀusion coeﬃcient, is found to be very small [25, 27], we will focus on the cases where D(cid:63) tends to zero. In this case,
we found a limit value for the stress at the interface in case of shear-banding and steady ﬂows. The limit is the yield
stress of the fully structured material τys (Fig. 2). Thus, we can solve the steady equations with D(cid:63) = 0, setting the
stress at the interface :

D. NUMERICAL METHOD FOR TRANSIENT FLOWS

1. Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method

To perform the numerical solution, we use a ﬁnite diﬀerence method for the spatial discretisation. The mesh is
split in two regions: the ﬁrst one is the ﬂuid zone for radii ri ≤ r ≤ ro and the second one is the solid zone for radii
ro ≤ r ≤ re. The mesh points are regularly spread between the inner radius ri and the outer radius ro in the ﬁrst
region and between ro and the external radius re in the second region. The number of points are the same in the two
regions. In order to solve the transient ﬂow, we use an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method [28, 29] for the
interface tracking. The method consists in solving the governing equations in the gap considering a mesh where one
node (1D problem) sticks to the interface. To keep a constant radial length between two successive nodes of the mesh
at each time step, the arbitrary velocity of nodes is given by:

be written in the moving domain [see 28, 29]:

(23)
In the last equation (23), the convective gradient term, u∇λ ensures the continuity of the structural parameter and
the yield stress across the interface as long as the interface velocity is not zero, even if there is no diﬀusive term in the
initial equation (14), i.e. when D(cid:63) tends to zero, as shown in the ﬁgure 3. Thus, in the case Re (cid:54)= 0 and u (cid:54)= 0 (ﬁnite
time), the stress at the interface given by eq. (18) is deﬁned even if D(cid:63) tends to zero in shear banded ﬂows because
of the smoothing due to the motion of the interface. The steady state of the shear banded ﬂow, i. e. with a sharp
discontinuity, can only be considered as an asymptotic state when the velocity tends to zero at t → +∞. One can
remark that the ﬁgure 3-b shows that the stress value at the interface tends to the yield stress of the fully structured
material τys as found previously with D(cid:63) tending to zero in the steady ﬂows.
To compute the ﬂow in the ﬂuid region ri ≤ r ≤ ro, one solves the set of equations (21, 22 and 23) with the
boundary conditions given in the section II C. The stress at the interface is equal to the local yield stress. This
latter condition provides the interface velocity uo. The structural parameter is also computed in the solid-like region
considering ˙γ = 0. One can notice that when ro = re, there is no interface between a ﬂuid and a solid-like region.
Thus, the stress has just to be above the local yield stress, i. e. ˙γ ≥ 0 everywhere.

The time scheme used for the velocity is a semi-implicit time scheme at the order one. Here, we focus on the 1D

equations where considering v = V (t, r)eθ and u = U (t, r)er, U being deﬁned by eq. (20):

The index n denotes the time step tn and Vn, for instance, stands for V (tn, rn). The radii rn and rn+1 are related by
rn+1 = rn + Un∆t with the time step deﬁned as ∆t = tn+1 − tn. The stress τ = −τrθ is given by the equation (11).
To implicit the time scheme, one writes the developpment for the stress at the order one in time:

where ˙γ = − ˙γrθ = V /r − ∂V /∂r. For numerical stability reasons, the time discretization scheme used

λn(rn+1) is obtained by the interpolated value of the former ﬁeld λn at the current node position rn+1. Thus, the

n )

(27)
To test that the ﬁnal steady state does not depend on the starting condition, as it would be expect when D(cid:63) = 0
[22], we deﬁne two cases. The ﬁrst one is a start at rest with the material fully structured, i. e. V0 = 0 and λ0 = 1
everywhere. As the thickness of the ﬂuid region collapses at the initial time, we take an arbitrary proﬁle for the ﬁrst
non-zero velocity at t1 = ∆t. The velocity V1 is deﬁned with a second order polynomial function of the radius. The
velocity ﬁeld V1 veriﬁes all the boundary conditions of the velocity and the strain rate is zero at the interface ro,1.
The stress τ1 in the initial ﬂuid region is calculated in order to balance the pulse momentum provided to accelerate
the ﬂow from 0 to the arbitrary velocity V1 (eq. 24). Thus, the stress depends on U0, i. e. on uo,1 = (ro,1 − ri)/∆t.
The position ro,1 of the interface is calculated to equalize the stress at the interface and the yield stress. From this
time, the velocity proﬁle is computed solving numerically the equations (24), (25) and (27). In the second scenario,
the calculation starts from a fully unstructured and ﬂowing material in the whole gap. The ﬁgures 4 show that both
transient stage tends to the same steady state even if the asymptotic steady state is a shear banded ﬂow as it will
be discussed in the following. The asymptotic case corresponds to the steady state where the interfacial stress is the
yield stress of the fully structured material. Setting D(cid:63) (cid:54)= 0, in the right-hand-side of the equation (14) would select
an intermediary value for the stress at the interface in a shear banded ﬂow. This stress would be smaller than the
yield stress of the fully structured material and depend on the scale length deﬁned by the diﬀusive coeﬃcient. Indeed,
it would smooth the variation of λ between its values in the ﬂowing region near the interface (i. e. < 1) and 1 in the
far distance, at the scale of the diﬀusive length, in the solid-like region.
In the following, we will focus on the case where the diﬀusive coeﬃcient D(cid:63) is 0. Knowing that the asymptotic
steady state of the transient stage corresponds to the steady state where the stress at the interface τo = τ (ro) = τys
deﬁned by the equation (19), i. e. eq. (18) with λo = 1, whatever shear banding or not, one can solve directly the
steady equations.

E. NUMERICAL METHODS FOR STEADY FLOWS

Only the ﬂuid region needs to be considered to solve the steady ﬂow. One uses the same ﬁnite diﬀerence method
for the spatial discretisation as for the unsteady problem. The stress points are taken between two successive velocity
points to insure the numerical accuracy of the scheme for the velocity. For the derivative operations, the standard
second order centred scheme is used. The numerical method used for the spatial discretisation is quite well established
and is similar to the ones used, for instance, in [30–32]. Moreover, a validation and a convergence test are performed
in the subsection IV B.
To calculate the base ﬂow, we consider the steady axisymetric solution of the equations (8), (9) and (14), i. e.
vb = Vb(r)eθ and λ = λb(r). In the ﬂuid domain, i. e. ri ≤ r ≤ ro, the only non-zero element of the strain rate tensor
is ˙γrθ. The strain rate does not reach zero in the ﬂowing region and its sign is always negative. Thus, one can write:

˙γb = − ˙γrθ,b =

and D(cid:63) = 0. 50 nodes per region.

The only non-zero element of the stress tensor τ is then τrθ. Considering the previous assumptions for the ﬂow,

the azimuthal component of the equation (8) becomes:

(31)

If ro ≥ re according the equation (31), all the material in the gap ﬂows and ro = re. In the next section, the
ﬂow curves show that the minimal value τmin of the stress may be below τyo. Thus, for τminre2 ≤ C < τyor2
e, an
alternative to the equation (31) is to set ro = re. In practice, it means that if there is no interface at the initial state,
the ﬂuid region ﬁts the whole gap for τminre2 ≤ C < τyor2
e and if there is a solid-like region in the initial state, the
ﬂowing region is conﬁned between ri and ro < re according Eq. (31).

To compute the ﬂow velocity in the yielded region, we calculate the strain rate in the yielded region by solving the

regular setup of equations at each point of the mesh:

with τyb the yield stress given by eq. (13) replacing λ by λb. Once we obtain the strain rate ˙γb and the structural
parameter λb for a given constant C by solving the setup of equations (32–33), the linear equation (28) is solved to
calculate the ﬂuid velocity with Vb(ro) = 0 as boundary condition. Finally, one has to ﬁnd the value of C such as
Vb(ri) = 1 using the algorithm available in Matlab to calculate the zero of a real non-linear function. If needed, the
pressure Pb of the base ﬂow can be obtained by integrating the equation:

III. EFFECT OF THE THIXOTROPY ON THE BASE FLOW

In the next sections, we set the thixotropic index breakdown to m = 1. It seems reasonable to argue that the
structural parameter λ modiﬁes the viscous term and the yield stress with the same order of magnitude. Thus, we ﬁx
∆K (cid:63) = τ (cid:63)
1 and so Bn = Bn0. As we focus our study on the cases where both a ﬂowing and a solid-like regions exist,
i. e. ro < re, the Bingham number is ﬁxed to Bn = 2. Finally, for steady state ﬂow only the ratio b(cid:63)/a(cid:63) appears and
we choose to set a(cid:63) = 1 without loss of generality.

A. Steady state ﬂow curves

The base ﬂow is computed using 50 nodes in the ﬂowing region of the gap to insure a good accuracy for the linear

stability analysis as shown in the validation subsection IV B.

We report in Fig.5 the evolution of the composite ﬂow curves under controlled shear rate for diﬀerent values of the
breakdown parameter b(cid:63). The composite curves are obtained straightfully by replacing the structural parameter λ by
its relation to ˙γ (32) in the constitutive law (11). As b(cid:63) increases, the composite curve drops from a monotonic to a
non-monotonic behavior which presents an unstable branch leading to shear banding [33]. This result indicates that,
in the range of parameters studied here, Houska’s model is able to predict shear banding.

The existence of a critical shear rate ˙γc in thixotropic yield stress ﬂuids is often explained in terms of an underlying
decreasing branch of the ﬂow curve at low shear rates [2]. In such a scenario, the constitutive relation of the material
is a decreasing function of the strain rate between 0 and ˙γ0 [see 1, for instance]. In the case of the shear localization,
the constitutive law is a growing function of ˙γ and its derivative is strictly positive. Thus, the shear-banding may
appear if the sign of the derivative changes at a critical strain rate ˙γ0 > 0. In other words, the necessary condition to
allow the shear-banded ﬂow is:

Thus, the range of strain rate [0, ˙γ0], where ∂τ /∂ ˙γ < 0, is unstable and the shear-banding allows to avoid the forbidden
values of ˙γ. In the steady-state, the derivative of the stress given by the Houska’s model is:

levels that correspond to multiple possible strain rates according the steady constitutive function of the material. For
Bingham-like behavior where m = nc = 1, eq. (35) using the derivative of τ given by eq. (36) admits only one positive

The derivative of τ (36) is negative for ˙γ ∈ [0, ˙γ0[. In case of the localisation of the ﬂow in r ∈ [ri, ro], ro < re, the
boundary condition at r = ro for the stress is:

τ ( ˙γ) = τyo .

(39)

The latter equation (39) admits alway ˙γ = 0 as zero but if the condition (38) is veriﬁed, this zero ˙γ = 0 is within the
forbidden range for ˙γ, i. e. [0, ˙γ0[, and thus, we observe the shear-banding. The second root of eq. (39) is

(40)

The ﬁgure 5 and eqs. (37) and (40) show that ˙γc ≥ ˙γ0 . The ﬁgures 6a-b shows the local stress-strain in several cases
under controlled global strain rate ˙γi = vi/d for b(cid:63) = 10. To control the strain rate in practice, the non-dimensional
parameters a(cid:63), b(cid:63) and Bn are re-calculated with the equations (6 and 12) using the chosen reference values of the
parameters and the aimed values of vi. Then, the non-dimensionalized velocity is multiplied by the value for the inner
cylinder in order to compare the ﬂows obtained at diﬀerent imposed strain rates ˙γi. As expected, in shear banded
ﬂows, the minimum value of the local strain rate is ˙γ(ro) = ˙γc. Of course, the outer radius of the ﬂuid region is such
as ro < re. The minimum value of the local stress is τo = τ (ro) = τyo as long as ro < re. In fact, ro is a growing
function of the controlled strain rate ˙γi as shown in the ﬁgure 7b. The lower branch of the composite ﬂow curve
corresponds to local stress-strain curve if there is no shear-banding, i. e. when ro = re (blue dashed-line in the ﬁgures
7). Nevertheless, when the controlled strain rate ˙γi is too low, under the vertical black dashed-line in the ﬁgures 7, the
local strain rate at re falls down zero because the local stress grows. The interface between the ﬂuid and the solid-like
region appears. The transient ﬂow ends at a shear banded ﬂow, the stress at the interface is τyo. Thus, there is a
range of controlled strain rates corresponding to the range of local strain rate at re [ ˙γ0, ≤ ˙γc[ where the steady state
depends on the existence of the interface in the initial state, i. e. if the strain rate decreases from the ﬂowing state
or grows from a shear-banded state. One can notice that the torque jumps up to the shear-banding value at the end
of the ﬂowing state (ﬁg. 8). Under controlled torque, the ﬂow may freeze in a Couette with a small gap when the

radii ratio η >(cid:112)τmin/τyo and ˙γo < ˙γ0. This result is consistent with the multiple yield stresses observed by Ovarlez

et al. [6].

One can notice that if nc < 1 and m ≥ 1,

∂τ
∂ ˙γ ˙γ(cid:55)→0+

→ +∞

(41)

and thus there is a range of strain rate values close to zero where τ ( ˙γ) is a growing function of ˙γ even if there is a
range of positive strain rates where the stress τ decreases when ˙γ grows. This case would be similar to the ﬂow curve
of a semidilute wormlike micelle solution with a yield stress like in the Fig. 1b of [34]. As there is no diﬀusion term in
our set of equations, sharp discontinuities of the strain rate and the structural parameter can appear within the ﬂuid
region at a radius ri < r < ro when nc < 1. Our numerical method does not allow such discontinuous ﬁelds in the
ﬂuid domain except at the interface between the ﬂuid and solid-like region, i. e. at r = ro. Thus, in the following,
we limit our parametric study to shear banded ﬂows with a banding interface between the ﬂowing and static regions
only (ﬂow curve like in Fig. 1c of [34]), i. e. with nc = 1 and shear localization with nc ≤ 1.

1 = 1,
a(cid:63) = 1 and b(cid:63) = 10.

B. Velocity proﬁles and structure parameter

The strain rate, the viscosity the velocity and the structure parameter proﬁles are shown in Fig. 9. We see that
whatever the value of b(cid:63), a ﬂowing and a static region coexists with the considered value of Bingham number Bn = 2.
However, the discontinuity of the strain rate proﬁle depends on the latter parameter and is related to a discontinuity
of the structure parameter. For lower values of b(cid:63), the velocity proﬁles as the structure parameter is continuous as
observed for example in carbopol gels, emulsions and foams [6, 35]. In that case, the shear localization is inherent
to the existence of the yield stress and no shear banding is observed. By contrast, for larger values of b(cid:63), the shear
rate becomes non-zero at the outer boundary of the ﬂowing region and the structural parameter λ does not reach 1
as it stands in the solid-like region when the breakdown parameter is greater than a critical value b(cid:63)
c = 1 (ﬁgs. 9).
Discontinuous strain rate proﬁles between a static and a ﬂowing region have been observed using MRI measurements
in cement pastes [36] and bentonite suspensions [35]. It corresponds to a steady-state shear-banded velocity proﬁle
where the shear rate is equal to a critical shear rate in the liquid region and is equal to zero in the solid region.

According eq. (38) and ﬁgs. 10, increasing the parameter τ (cid:63)

1 may produce the same eﬀect as increasing b(cid:63)/a(cid:63). The
steady state ﬂow is controlled by the competition between the restructuring and the breakdown eﬀects. The more
the structure close to the interface is broken eﬃciently by the strain rate (ﬁg. 9d and 10d), the more the viscosity
drops signiﬁcantly and rapidly. A band in terms of structure takes place next to the unyielded region (ﬁg. 9b and
10b). Then, the transition from shear localization to shear banding is feasible.

At last, we explore the eﬀect of the shear-thinning index nc . When nc < 1, the simple shear-banded ﬂows as
observed in ﬁgs. 9 or 10 are not observed because the constitutive relation of the material is always a growing
function for ˙γ suﬃciently close to zero (eq. 41), allowing small values for ˙γ in the ﬂow . In that case the ﬂow is always
shear-localized. This contrast with the previous cases discussed above (nc = 1) where small values of ˙γ fall in the
unstable branch of the ﬂow curve and then lead to shear banded ﬂows. In order to keep only one ﬂowing zone in the
explored range of nc, we set ∆K (cid:63) = τ (cid:63)
1 = 0.5. Staying on the continuous solution for the structural parameter λ, the
inner strain rate increases with the shear-thinning index nc and the structural parameter λ reaches smoothly the fully
structured state of the solid-like zone because of the growing viscosity near yo (ﬁgs. 11). As it would be expected
from the velocity proﬁles obtained with Carreau ﬂuids by Alibenyahia et al.
[11], the ﬂow is conﬁned close to the
inner cylinder when the shear-thinning index nc decreases. It conﬁrms that the shear-thinning behaviour conﬁned

C.

Interface between the static and the ﬂowing regions

Now, we focus on the evolution of the width of the ﬂowing region yo = ro − ri depending on the thixotropic
parameters and the shear-thinning index nc. yo can be obtained on ﬁgs. 9-d, 10-d and 11-d by reading the abscissa
where λ reaches 1. On ﬁgs. 12-a, b and c, the curve of yo separates the inner ﬂowing region from the outer static
region. The transition between the shear localization and the shear banding is smooth because, at r = ro, the strain
rate ˙γc increases continuously from zero at the critical conditions and the stress at the interface is still the yield
stress of the fully structured material. Nevertheless, it is observed on ﬁg. 12-a that the variation of yo is much
more important in the regime of the continuous shear localization than when the shear banding occurs. When the
breakdown parameter b(cid:63) increases, the size of the ﬂowing region, characterized by the reduced position yo = ro − ri
of the interface between the liquid and the solid-like regions, decreases to a minimum size corresponding to the one
of the fully unstructured equivalent Bingham ﬂuid when b(cid:63) → +∞ (ﬁg. 12-a). Quite similar remark can be done
when ∆K (cid:63) and τ (cid:63)
1 makes the shear-thinning behaviour stronger in the

steady ﬂowing region. Thus, it is not surprising that when the shear-thinning index nc decreases, the width of the
ﬂowing zone also decreases (ﬁg. 12-c). Nevertheless, the model with one structural parameter allows to predict the
shear banding which can not be described by the Bingham law or the Hershel-Bulkley law. When the thixotropic
parameters are increasing above some critical values given by eq. (38), the shear-banding appears smoothly from the
shear localization where the strain rate is continuous between the ﬂowing and static regions.

Now, we will study the linear stability of the base ﬂow, whatever we have shear-banding or not.

IV. LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS

A. Equations setup

To perform a linear analysis of stability, the ﬂuid velocity, the structural parameter and the pressure are decomposed

such as:

v = vb + ˜v(r) exp(σt + inθ + ikz)
λ = λb + ˜λ(r) exp(σt + inθ + ikz)
p = Pb + ˜p(r) exp(σt + inθ + ikz)

(42)

(43)
(44)

˜v, ˜λ and ˜p describe the perturbation of the base ﬂow considering the azimuthal mode n and the axial wave number
k. Injecting eqs. (42 – 44) in the general setup of equations (8, 14, 9) and after withdrawing the nonlinear terms, the
linear setup of equations for the perturbation of the base ﬂow is:

V is the vertical matrix of the values of the components of velocity ˜v at each inner point of the gap. Λ is the vertical
matrix of the values of ˜λ at each point of the mesh, including the inner and outer radii. P is the the vertical matrix
of the values of ˜p taken in the middle points of two successive nodes of the velocity and structural parameter mesh.
The linear problem (48) admits a number of inﬁnite eigenvalues which is two times the number of degree of freedom
of the pressure. The inﬁnite eigenvalues have to be eliminate because they correspond to non-zero divergence velocity
ﬁelds. Nevertheless, it is not harmful because Matlab’s algorithm generates true inﬁnite eigenvalues avoiding any
ambiguity.

B. Convergence test and validation

In order to test the convergence of our numerical scheme and to validate our method, the critical Reynolds number
Rec and the critical axial wave number kc are determined using diﬀerent number of nodes M in the gap. The results
are given in the tables I and II. For Newtonian ﬂuids, many works allows us to validate our results. In a recent work
[32], a similar numerical method gives Rec = 131.66 and kc = 3.130 in Newtonian ﬂuids with η = 0.9. Their values
are in very good agreement with ours. More, for Bingham ﬂuids, Alibenyahia et al. [11] found Rec = 127.74943 and
kc = 3.183706 with a spectral method at Bn = 1 and η = 0.5. Once again, our results in the table II agree this values
within an error below 0.1%.
According, the tables I and II and the results of [11] and [32], we can estimate the relative error for the critical
values of the Reynolds number Rec and the axial wave number kc below 0.1% when M ≥ 50. Thus, we use M = 50
in the following.

C. Stability analysis of Couette ﬂow of thixotropic yield stress ﬂuids

To determine the critical eigenmode of the linear setup of equations (48), the algorithm seeks the minimum of the
critical value of the Reynolds number Rec depending on the wave number k for a given azimutal mode n. The critical
Reynolds number is reached when the real part of the eigenvalue σ is zero. The minimal value of Rec is reached at
the critical wave number kc. We have veriﬁed that the critical perturbation is always axisymetric, i. e. n = 0, by
computing the critical Reynolds number for the azimuthal modes n from 0 to 3 within the range of our parameters for
the thixotropic yielded ﬂuids. The results is that the Taylor vortices, steady and axisymmetric, corresponds always
to the most unstable eigenmode of (48). One can observed that the equation (46) does not generate oscillating or
three-dimensional modes and only the values of the critical wave number kc and the critical Reynolds number Rec are
modiﬁed compared to the Newtonien or shear-thinning cases. One can notice this result because it means that the
unsteady eﬀects of the thixotropy in cylindrical Couette ﬂow which might occur above the threshold of the primary
instability are nonlinear. Nevertheless, shear-banded ﬂows may occur with thixotropic yielded ﬂuids. This is a real
diﬀerence with simple yielded ﬂuids.

gap η = 0.5, Bn = 2, nc = 1, ∆K (cid:63) = τ (cid:63)
1 = 1 and a(cid:63) = 1. Vertical dashed-line stands for the critical value of b(cid:63) = 1 where the
strain rate at the interface ˙γo becomes non-zero.

The ratio b(cid:63)/a(cid:63) denotes the resistance against the strain rate ˙γ of the structure described by λ. The higher b(cid:63)/a(cid:63)
is, the easier the inner structure of the ﬂuid is broken down by the shear. As shown previously in ﬁg. 12, the ﬂowing
region decreases because the yield stress collapses with the breakdown of the structure. If the ﬂuid would be a viscous
Newtonian ﬂuid, the critical Reynolds number would increases because of the gap becomes small. In the ﬁg. 13-a,
the variation of Rec with b(cid:63) suggests that our choice for the reference viscosity µref is representative of an equivalent
Newtonian ﬂuid and thus we retrieve the stabilizing eﬀect of the reduction of the gap width. Moreover, as the viscosity
of the ﬂuid decrease when the inner structure is broken, the ﬂuid is stronger and stronger shear-thinning. Thus, it is
not surprising that the grow of b(cid:63)/a(cid:63) ends by stabilizing the ﬂow (ﬁg. 13-a) as it is observed experimentally for large
gap by Escudier et al. [10] and shown by Alibenhahia et al. [11] when the shear-thinning index nc < 0.6 for η = 0.5.
Nevertheless, for yielded ﬂuids, one can argue that the eﬀective gap corresponds to the ﬂuid zone. The Reynolds
number Reo = yoRe is calculated with the gap width of the yielded region yo. In this case, the collapse of the width yo
of the ﬂuid zone (ﬁg. 12) because of the breakdown of the inner micro-structure is stronger than the stabilizing eﬀect
of shear-thinning and the critical Reynolds number Reco decreases until yo is close to its minimum value corresponding
to a fully destructured ﬂuid (ﬁg. 13-b). The critical wave number kc mainly follows the evolution of the ﬂuid gap
width and thus it increases with b(cid:63) (ﬁg. 13-c). Of course, by recalculating the wave number considering the ﬂuid gap
as the eﬀective gap, show that the wave length Lz = 2π/kco ﬁrst increase because the high viscosity near the end of

the ﬂuid area decrease when b(cid:63) increases. Thus, the vortices are squeezed toward the inner wall as shown in the ﬁg.
14-a. When the shear-banding appears, the stratiﬁcation of the viscosity is weaken and the Taylor vortices takes all
the place in the ﬂuid zone (ﬁg. 14-c,d). Thus, the wave number kco tends to an asymptotic value wich correspond
to the rolls of an equivalent fully destructured ﬂuid (∆K (cid:63) = τ (cid:63)
1 = 0). To compute the critical Reynolds number of
an equivalent non-thixotropic ﬂuid when the gap width correspond to yo for b(cid:63) = 10, we have to set η = 0.7403 and
Bn = 0.7018. The critical Reynolds number is Rec = 126.9870 and the critical wave number kc = 2.9177. This values
have to be compared to Reco = 119.4021 and kco = 2.8981 found when b(cid:63) = 10. As expected, for high values of b(cid:63), it
ﬁts with an equivalent non-thixotropic (simple) ﬂuid ﬂowing in a smaller gap.

It is worthy to notice that the perturbation of the structural parameter λ corresponds to the convection of the

convection from the inner cylinder where the structural parameter is low toward the outer cylinder. Thus, in our
parameter range, the linear stability is driven by the Navier-Stokes equation and the perturbation of the structural
parameter is a passive mode.

The parameters ∆K (cid:63) and τ (cid:63)

1 stabilise the ﬂow according the ﬁgure 15-a. Nevertheless, as previously, the material
gap size is not the most relevant to deﬁne the critical Reynolds number. From this point of view, the Reynolds number
Reco decreases and the ﬂow is destabilized (ﬁg. 15-b). Indeed, the decrease of the viscosity with λ is greater when
∆K (cid:63) and τ (cid:63)
1 increase. The collapse of the dead zone due to high viscosity near the transition between the ﬂuid and
solid-like zones after the onset of the shear-banding is responsible of the increasing of kco in ﬁg. 15-d.

Finally, the eﬀect of nc seems to be either destabilizing or stabilizing depending if we track Rec (ﬁg. 16-a) or Reco
(ﬁg. 16-b). The ﬁgures 17 show that the Taylor-vortices are shifted toward the inner cylinder as the shear-thinning
behavior increases. The eﬀect is similar as increasing the shear-thinning behavior with the parameters b(cid:63), ∆K (cid:63) and
τ (cid:63)
1 ) for the shear-localized ﬂows. In shear-banded ﬂows (ﬁgs 14c-d), the width of the dead zone collapses and thus,
the Taylor-vortices expand in the whole ﬂuid region.

To conclude on the eﬀect of the thixotropy on the linear stability of the Couette ﬂow, ﬁrst the critical mode
corresponds to the axisymmetric Taylor-vortices which are also found for simple yield stress ﬂuids, such as Bingham
ﬂuids [14]. The critical eigenvalue is real as in simple ﬂuids. The results found by Landry et al. [14] with Bingham

ﬂuids or Alibenyahia et al. [11] with shear-thinning ﬂuids are retrieved. The critical perturbation is driven by the
inertial term, i. e. by the centrifugal force. The yield stress and the shear thinning behavior conﬁne the rolls toward
the inner cylinder in the wide-gap case. In a Bingham ﬂuid, Chen et al. [15] show that the optimal perturbation is
also shifted toward the inner cylinder in the wide-gap case. Thus, even during the transient growth preceding the
onset of the instability, only the inner zone of the gap is perturbed. The perturbation of the structural parameter is
driven by the convection of the material because of the radial and axial velocity of the Taylor vortices. The stabilizing
or destabilizing eﬀect depends on the reference viscosity used for the deﬁnition of the Reynolds number. Nevertheless,
the key point is that increasing the shear-thinning behaviour reduces the width of the inner region where the viscosity
is low. As it would be the case if the material gap size would be reduced, it stabilizes the ﬂow. The shear-thinning
is not only driven by nc but also by the thixotropic parameters, i. e. the ratio b(cid:63)/a(cid:63), ∆K (cid:63) and τ (cid:63)
1 . Although the
thixotropy does not produced a qualitative modiﬁcation of the linear stability of the ﬂow in case of shear localization,
it can make appear a second kind of base ﬂow. In the shear localization case, the strain rate drops smoothly to zero at
the interface between the ﬂuid and solid-like regions. Thus, there is a so-called dead zone where the viscosity becomes
very strong near the interface. The width of the dead zone collapses in the shear banded ﬂows (Figs. 9b, 10b). Thus,
the Taylor vortices can occupied the ﬂuid gap as it would be the case with shear-thinning ﬂuids in an equivalent ratio
of radii ηeq = ro/ri, i. e. in a narrow-gap case.

instability, as it would be the case for simple yield stress ﬂuids, such as Bingham’s ﬂuids.

V. REFERENCE VISCOSITY AND REFERENCE YIELD STRESS

The ﬁgure 19-a shows that the reference chosen for the viscosity may dramatically change the conclusion about
the eﬀect of the parameters on the critical value of the Reynolds number. Nevertheless, the comparison between ﬁgs.
13-b and 19-b shows that the relevant length is the width of the ﬂuid gap yo. Moreover, the asymptotic behaviour
for large b(cid:63) can also be retrieved in ﬁg. 19-b: the critical Reynolds Reco = 130.2569 close to the one of the equivalent
case with Bingham ﬂuid, Rec = 126.9870.

The viscosity µ0 is also a good choice to interpret the results but our reference µref might be more relevant in a

practical point of view. Moreover, it reproduces the stabilizing eﬀect of thinning the gap which would be observed
with Newtonian ﬂuids. Finally, we deﬁned the wall Reynolds number as

Rew = Re/µw

(49)

where µw is the shear-viscosity of the ﬂuid on the inner cylinder. This viscosity is relevant because it determines
the resistive torque on the rotating cylinder which is measured in rheological experiment. Moreover, the centrifugal
instability at the origin of the onset of the Taylor vortices is triggered at the low viscosity region close to the inner
cylinder. The ﬁg. 20-a shows that the inner wall shear-viscosity µw decreases for b(cid:63) = 0.6 just before the onset of
the shear-banding. For the shear-banded ﬂows, the inner wall shear-viscosity increases to reach a limit value when
b(cid:63) becomes high, i. e. when the structure is broken down even when the strain rate is low. The critical Reynolds
number calculated with the wall viscosity is strongly growing before the onset of the shear-banding but it is slightly
constant (∼ 250) for the shear-banded ﬂow (ﬁg. 20-b). This observation suggests that the inner wall shear-viscosity
is more relevant for the onset of the Taylor vortices when the velocity proﬁle of the base ﬂow corresponds to the
shear-banding, i. e. when the strain rate does not fall down zero and the viscosity values are ﬁnite and moderate.

Thus, the thixotropic yielded ﬂuids behave mainly as a viscous ﬂuid when the structure is fragile and the shear-
banding appears. In this case, the inner wall viscosity is a good reference to predict the onset of the Taylor vortices.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this work we have studied the base ﬂow and the linear stability in a Couette cell of a thixotropic yield stress
material modelized by the Houska’s model. This model with one structural parameter allows non-monotonic composite
ﬂow curves depending on the ratio between the building and breakdown parameters b(cid:63)/a(cid:63) (Fig. 5). In case of non-
monotonic composite curves, a shear banded ﬂow occurs if only a part of the gap ﬂows. In shear banding, the structural
parameter λ jumps abruptly from a value < 1 to 1 across the interface between the ﬂuid and the solid-like zones. The
shear rate ˙γ is sharply discontinuous across the interface and the width of the high viscosity zone, called the dead
zone, collapses with the shear-banding. In shear banded ﬂows, the transient ﬂow shows that the selected stress at the
interface is the yield stress of the solid material where λ = 1 if there is no diﬀusive term for the structural parameter.
One can notice that adding a diﬀusive term would select a lower stress corresponding to the yield stress of the partially
structured material. For the following linear stability analysis, we only consider the case where the diﬀusive parameter
is neglectable. The primary instability of the Couette ﬂow is studied for a large gap (η = 0.5) when the Bingham
number Bn is suﬃciently high to have a solid-like region in the gap. The thixotropy does not modify the kind of the
linear unstable mode which is still steady and axisymmetric in the large range of parameters explored in comparison
with simple yield stress ﬂuids [14]. We retrieve that the choice of the viscosity to scaled the Reynolds number may
modify the conclusion about the eﬀect of the thixotropy as for shear-thinning ﬂuids. Considering a Reynolds number
based on our reference viscosity µref or the inner-wall shear-viscosity µw, lead to the conclusion that the thixotropy
stabilizes the Couette ﬂow because it increases the stratiﬁcation of the viscosity over the gap. This stabilizing eﬀect
was also found by [11] with shear-thinning ﬂuids. Nevertheless, re-scaling the Reynolds number with the ﬂowing gap
size yo shows that there is a competition between the reduction of the stratiﬁcation of the viscosity which destabilizes
the ﬂow and the reduction of the eﬀective gap size because of the breakdown of the ﬂuid structure. The shear-banding
dramatically reduces the stratiﬁcation of the viscosity which remains ﬁnite and moderate in the ﬂuid region but it
squeezes the ﬂuid area near the inner wall. Thus, the yo-scaled Reynolds number Reco is only slightly growing and
tends to a constant value for high values of the breakdown parameter b(cid:63).

Finally, The thixotropy allows for shear banding ﬂows but does not induce transition to unsteady and non-
axisymmetric ﬂows according to linear perturbations. For shear localized ﬂows, the transition is driven by both
the stratiﬁcation of the viscosity and the size of the ﬂowing region as in Bingham’s ﬂuids for instance [14]. When
shear banding occurs, the stratiﬁcation of the viscosity vanishes and the transition is mainly controlled by the eﬀective
gap (yo). The shear-banding modiﬁes the linear stability of the ﬂow which becomes similar to the one of a circular
Couette setup with a smaller gap and without any dead zone. The unsteady eﬀects of the thixotropy may thus appears

further works.
