Abstract

We present three-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric analogues of the two
known series of dually equivalent gauge-invariant actions for oﬀ-shell massless N = 1
higher spin supermultiplets in four dimensions. The 3D higher spin series obtained
terminate at the linearised actions for the (1,1) minimal and w = −1 non-minimal
N = 2 Poincar´e supergravity theories constructed in arXiv:1109.0496. Similar to
the 3D supergravity actions, their higher spin counterparts propagate no degrees
of freedom. However, the 3D N = 2 massless higher spin supermultiplets can be
used to construct oﬀ-shell massive N = 2 supermultiplets by combining the mass-
less actions with those describing higher spin extensions of the linearised N = 2
conformal supergravity. Such gauge-invariant N = 2 superconformal higher spin
actions are explicitly derived. They make use of a higher spin generalisation of the
super-Cotton tensor, the only curvature tensor describing the superspace geometry
of conformal supergravity.

Introduction

In supersymmetric ﬁeld theory, it is of interest to construct oﬀ-shell supersymmetric
extensions in diverse dimensions of the (Fang-)Fronsdal actions for massless higher spin
ﬁelds in Minkowski [1, 2] and anti-de Sitter [3, 4] spacetimes. In four spacetime dimensions
(4D), this problem was solved in the early 1990s. In the N = 1 super-Poincar´e case, the
oﬀ-shell formulations for massless higher spin supermultiplets were developed in [5, 6].
For each superspin1 s ≥ 1, half-integer [5] and integer [6], these publications provided
two dually equivalent oﬀ-shell realisations in N = 1 Minkowski superspace. At the
component level, each of the two superspin-s actions [5, 6] reduces, upon imposing a
Wess-Zumino-type gauge and eliminating the auxiliary ﬁelds, to a sum of the spin-s and
spin-(s + 1/2) actions [1, 2]. The oﬀ-shell higher spin supermultiplets of [5, 6] were
generalised to the case of anti-de Sitter supersymmetry in [7]. Making use of the N = 1
supermultiplets constructed in [5, 6, 7], oﬀ-shell formulations for 4D N = 2 massless higher
spin supermultiplets were presented in [8, 9].2 A pedagogical review of the supersymmetric
higher spin models proposed in [5, 6] is given in section 6.9 of [11].3 A comprehensive
review of the results of [5, 6, 7], including a detailed analysis of the component structure
of the models constructed, is given in [12].

In this paper, we present oﬀ-shell N = 2 supersymmetric generalisations of the 3D
(Fang-)Fronsdal actions and derive their massive deformations.
In principle, one may
construct all 3D N = 2 massless higher spin supermultiplets by applying an oﬀ-shell
version of dimensional reduction d = 4 → d = 3 to the 4D N = 1 supermultiplets [5, 6].
Such a procedure has been carried out in [13] to obtain one of the four oﬀ-shell actions
(given in [13]) for linearised 3D N = 2 supergravity (superspin s = 3/2). In practice,
however, naive dimensional reduction is not quite eﬃcient to deal with in the case of higher
spin supermultiplets. The point is that its application to a 4D superspin-s multiplet, with
s > 3/2, leads to a superposition of several 3D multiplets, one of which carries superspin

1In four dimensions, the massless multiplet of superspin s describes two ﬁelds of spin s and s + 1

2 ; it

is often denoted (s, s + 1

2 ).

2An important bi-product of the higher spin construction given in [9] was the explicit description of
the inﬁnite dimensional superalgebra of Killing tensor superﬁelds of 4D N = 1 anti-de Sitter superspace.
This superalgebra corresponds to the rigid symmetries of the generating action for the massless super-
multiplets of arbitrary superspin in 4D N = 1 anti-de Sitter superspace, which was constructed in [9]. A
generalisation of the concept of Killing tensor superﬁelds given in [9] has recently been appeared in [10].
3Section 6.9 of [11] also contains a pedagogical review of the (Fang-)Fronsdal actions for free massless
higher spin ﬁelds in 4D Minkowski space [1, 2], including a direct proof of the fact that that the massless
spin-s action describes two helicity states ±s.

s and the others correspond to lower superspin values.4 Some work is required in order
to disentangle the superspin-s multiplet from the lower-superspin ones. It appears more
eﬃcient to recast the 4D gauge principle of [5, 6] in a 3D form and used it to construct
gauge-invariant actions. This is our approach in the present paper.

In three dimensions, the massless spin-s actions of [1, 2] are known to propagate no
local degrees of freedoms for s > 1.5 Of course, this is consistent with the fact that the
notion of 3D spin is well deﬁned only in the massive case [14]. When speaking of a 3D
massless spin-s theory, we will refer to the kinematic structure of the ﬁeld variables, their
gauge transformation laws and the gauge-invariant action. One reason to study such a
theory is that it may be deformed (say, by including auxiliary lower-spin ﬁelds and adding
mass terms) to result in a model describing a massive spin-s ﬁeld.

There have appeared two diﬀerent constructions of Lagrangian models for 3D massive
higher spin ﬁelds [15, 16]. The approach of [16] has been used to formulate on-shell
models for massive N = 1 higher spin supermultiplets [17]. In this paper we will pursue an
alternative approach to address the problem of constructing oﬀ-shell massive N = 2 higher
spin supermultiplets. Our approach will be based on deriving a higher spin generalisation
of the N = 2 super-Cotton tensor6 [18, 19] that can be used to write down a topological
mass term.

An important feature of 3D gauge theories is the possibility to generate the mass for
gauge ﬁelds of diﬀerent spin by adding to the massless action a gauge-invariant Chern-
Simons-type term of topological origin. This idea has been used to construct topologically
massive electrodynamics [21, 22, 23], topologically massive gravity [23] and topologically
massive N = 1 supergravity [24, 25]. The latter theory admits generalisations with
N > 1, including the oﬀ-shell topologically massive supergravity theories with N = 2 [26]
and N = 3 and N = 4 [27]. In the case of 3D supergravity theories, the topological mass
term may be interpreted as an action for conformal supergravity (see [28] for a review
of 4D conformal supergravity theories). The oﬀ-shell actions for N -extended conformal

4In the case of a half-integer superspin s = n+1/2, with n = 2, 3, . . . , one of the 4D dynamical variables
[5] is a real unconstrained superﬁeld Hα1 ...αn ˙α1... ˙αn = H(α1 ...αn)( ˙α1... ˙αn). Its dimensional reduction d =
4 → d = 3 leads to a family of unconstrained symmetric superﬁelds Hα1 ...α2n , Hα1 ...α2n−2 , · · · , H, of
which only Hα1...α2n is required to describe a massless 3D supermultiplet.
In the supergravity case,
s = 3/2, dimensional reduction d = 4 → d = 3 leads to two multiplets, an oﬀ-shell N = 2 supergravity
multiplet and an Abelian vector multiplet [13].

5See Appendix B for a direct proof.
6Upon ﬁxing the super-Weyl and local U(1)R symmetries, the super-Cotton tensor derived in [18]

reduces to that introduced earlier by Zupnik and Pak [20].

supergravity theories were constructed in [29] for N = 1, [30] for N = 2, [31] for N =
3, 4, 5, and [32, 33] for N = 6.7 An arbitrary variation of such an action with respect to
a supergravity prepotential is given in terms of the N -extended super-Cotton tensor [19].
This means that a linearised supergravity action is determined by the linearised super-
Cotton tensor, W (H). The corresponding Lagrangian is symbolically LCSG = H · W (H),
where H is the linearised conformal supergravity prepotential. The super-Cotton tensor
W (H) is a unique ﬁeld strength being invariant under the linearised gauge transformations
of conformal supergravity.

Our construction of the linearised higher spin superconformal actions is analogous to
that of the 3D higher spin conformal gravity actions derived by Pope and Townsend [34]
(the 3D analogues of the conformal higher spin actions pioneered by Fradkin and Tseytlin
[28]). The Pope-Townsend conformal action for the spin-s ﬁeld makes use of the linearised
spin-s Cotton tensor (which can be read oﬀ from the action (31) in [34]). The s = 3 case
was studied earlier in [35]. For recent discussions of the linearised higher spin Cotton
tensors [34] and their generalisations, see [36, 37] and references therein.

This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 is devoted to general properties of trans-
verse and longitudinal linear superﬁelds. Section 3 is concerned with on-shell massive
ﬁelds and N = 2 superﬁelds. Two series of oﬀ-shell actions for massless half-integer
superspin multiplets are introduced in section 4. Section 5 is devoted to a brief discus-
sion of the component reduction of the models presented in section 4. In section 6 we
present N = 2 superconformal higher spin actions and derive a higher spin extension
of the linearised N = 2 super-Cotton tensor. Oﬀ-shell actions for massive higher spin
supermultiplets are presented in section 7. Concluding comments are given in section 8.
The main body of the paper is accompanied by two appendices. Appendix A summarises
our notation and conventions. Appendix B is devoted to the 3D (Fang-)Fronsdal massless
actions in the two-component notation.

2 Linear superﬁelds

A symmetric rank-n spinor superﬁeld, Γα1···αn = Γ(α1···αn), is called transverse linear if

it obeys the constraint

¯DβΓβα1...αn−1 = 0 ,

n > 0 .

(2.1a)

7The component actions for N = 1, 2 conformal supergravities [29, 30] have been re-derived within

the universal superspace setting of [31].

4

A symmetric rank-n spinor superﬁeld, Gα1···αn = G(α1···αn), is called longitudinal linear if
it obeys the constraint

¯D(α1Gα2...αn+1) = 0 ,

which for n = 0 is equivalent to the chirality condition

¯DαG = 0 .

(2.1b)

(2.2)

The constraints (2.1a) and (2.1b) imply that Γα1···αn and Gα1···αn are linear superﬁelds in
the usual sense:

¯D2Γα1···αn = 0 ,
¯D2Gα1···αn = 0 .

(2.3a)

(2.3b)

In the case n = 0, the transverse constraint (2.1a) is not deﬁned, but its corollary (2.3a)
can be used. In four dimensions, the transverse and longitudinal linear superﬁelds were
introduced for the ﬁrst time by Ivanov and Sorin [38] (who built on the earlier results
by Salam and Strathdee [39] and Sokatchev [40] in the super-Poincar´e case) as a means
to realise the irreducible representations of the N = 1 anti-de Sitter supersymmetry. As
dynamical variables, such superﬁelds were used for the ﬁrst time in [5, 6, 7].

We assume that Γα1···αn and Gα1···αn are complex and the diﬀerential conditions (2.1a)
and (2.1b) are the only constraints these superﬁelds obey. The constraints (2.1a) and
(2.1b) can be solved in terms of complex unconstrained prepotentials ξα1...αn+1 = ξ(α1...αn+1)
and ζα1...αn−1 = ζ(α1...αn−1) according to the rules

Γα1...αn = ¯Dβξβα1...αn ,
Gα1...αn = ¯D(α1ζα2...αn) .

There is a natural arbitrariness in the choice of the prepotentials ξ and ζ, namely,

δξα1...αn+1 = Γα1...αn+1 ,

δζα1...αn−1 = Gα1...αn−1 .

(2.4a)

(2.4b)

(2.5a)

(2.5b)

Here, the gauge parameter Γα(n+1) is a transverse linear superﬁeld, and Gα(n−1) is a
longitudinal linear one. As a result, there emerge the transverse and longitudinal gauge
hierarchies:

Γα(n) −→ Γα(n+1) −→ Γα(n+2) . . . ,

(2.6a)

5

Gα(n) −→ Gα(n−1) −→ Gα(n−2) . . . −→ G .

(2.6b)

Thus, in accordance with the terminology of gauge theories with linearly dependent gener-
ators [41], any Lagrangian theory described by a transverse (longitudinal) linear superﬁeld
Γα1...αn (Gα1...αn) can be considered as the theory of an unconstrained prepotential ξα1...αn+1
(ζα1...αn−1) with an additional gauge invariance of an inﬁnite (ﬁnite) stage of reducibility.

Suppose we are given a supersymmetric ﬁeld theory described by a transverse linear
superﬁeld Γα(n) and its conjugate ¯Γα(n), for n > 0, with an action functional S[Γ, ¯Γ]. Such
a theory possesses a dual formulation, SD[G, ¯G], described in terms of a longitudinal linear
superﬁeld Gα(n) and its conjugate ¯Gα(n). The latter theory is obtained by introducing a
ﬁrst-oder action of the form

S[V, ¯V , G, ¯G] = S[V, ¯V ] +Z d3xd2θd2 ¯θ(cid:16)V α(n)Gα(n) + (−1)n ¯V α(n) ¯Gα(n)(cid:17) ,

(2.7)

where the symmetric rank-n spinor Vα(n) is a complex unconstrained superﬁeld. The ﬁrst
term in the action, S[V, ¯V ], is obtained from S[Γ, ¯Γ] by the replacement Γα(n) → Vα(n).
Varying (2.7) with respect to Gα(n) gives Vα(n) = Γα(n), and then the second term in (2.7)
drops out, due to the identity

Z d3xd2θd2 ¯θ Γα(n)Gα(n) = 0 .

(2.8)

As a result, the ﬁrst-order action reduces to the original one, S[Γ, ¯Γ]. On the other hand,
we can consider the equation of motion for V α(n),

δ

δV α(n) S[V, ¯V ] + Gα(n) = 0 ,

(2.9)

and the conjugate equation. We assume that these equations are uniquely solved to give
Vα(n) as a functional of Gα(n) and ¯Gα(n). Substituting this solution back into (2.7), we end
up with the dual action SD[G, ¯G].

A real transverse linear superﬁeld Tα1···αn = T(α1···αn) is characterised by the properties

¯Tα1···αn = Tα1···αn ,

¯DβTβα1···αn−1 = 0 ⇐⇒ DβTβα1···αn−1 = 0 .

(2.10)

The second-order diﬀerential operator

∆ =

Dα ¯Dα

i
2

(2.11)

acts on the space of such superﬁelds. Indeed, ∆Tα1···αn is real and one may check that

¯Dβ∆Tβα1···αn−1 = 0 ,

Dβ∆Tβα1···αn−1 = 0 .

(2.12)

3 Massive (super)ﬁelds

In this section we discuss on-shell superﬁelds which realise the massive representations

of the (super-)Poincar´e group.

3.1 Massive ﬁelds

Let Pa and Jab = −Jba be the generators of the 3D Poincar´e group. The Pauli-Lubanski

scalar

W :=

1
2

εabcPaJbc = −

1
2

P αβJαβ

(3.1)

commutes with the generators Pa and Jab.
Irreducible unitary representations of the
Poincar´e group are labelled by two parameters, mass m and helicity λ, which are associ-
ated with the Casimir operators,

P aPa = −m2

1 ,

W = mλ1 .

One deﬁnes |λ| to be the spin.

In the case of ﬁeld representations,

W =

1
2

∂αβMαβ ,

where the action of Mαβ = Mβα on a ﬁeld φγ1···γn = φ(γ1···γn) is deﬁned by

Mαβφγ1···γn =

nXi=1

εγi(αφβ)γ1··· bγi...γn ,

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

where the hatted index of φβγ1··· bγi...γn is omitted.

For n > 1, a massive ﬁeld, φα1···αn = ¯φα1...αn = φ(α1···αn), is a real symmetric rank-n

spinor ﬁeld which obeys the diﬀerential conditions [15] (see also [42])

∂βγφβγα1···αn−2 = 0 ,
∂β

(α1φα2...αn)β = mσφα1...αn ,

σ = ±1 .

(3.5a)

(3.5b)

In the spinor case, n = 1, eq. (3.5a) is absent, and it is the Dirac equation (3.5b) which
deﬁnes a massive ﬁeld.
It is easy to see that (3.5a) and (3.5b) imply the mass-shell
equation8

8The equations (3.5a) and (3.6) proves to be equivalent to the 3D Fierz-Pauli ﬁeld equations [43].

(✷ − m2)φα1···αn = 0 ,

(3.6)

7

which is the ﬁrst equation in (3.2). In the case n = 1, eq. (3.6) follows from the Dirac
equation (3.5b). The second relation in (3.2) also holds, with

λ =

n
2

σ .

(3.7)

3.2 Massive superﬁelds

Let Pa, Jab = −Jba, Qα and ¯Qα be the generators of the 3D N = 2 super-Poincar´e
group. The supersymmetric extension of the Pauli-Lubanski scalar (3.1) is the following
operator [44]

Z = W −

i
4

Qα ¯Qα =

1
2

εabcPaJbc −

i
4

Qα ¯Qα ,

which commutes with the supercharges,

[Z, Qα] = [Z, ¯Qα] = 0 .

(3.8)

(3.9)

Irreducible unitary representations of the super-Poincar´e group are labelled by two pa-
rameters, mass m and superhelicity κ, which are associated with the Casimir operators,

P aPa = −m2

1 ,

Z = mκ1 .

(3.10)

Our deﬁnition of the superhelicity agrees with [44].
It is instructive to compare the
operator Z, eq. (3.8), with the 4D N = 1 superhelicity operator introduced in [11]. The
massive representation of superhelicity κ is a direct sum of four massive representations
of the Poincar´e group with helicity values (κ− 1
2). The parameter |k| is referred
to as superspin [44].

2, κ, κ, κ+ 1

In the case of superﬁeld representations, the superhelicity operator may be expressed

in the following manifestly supersymmetric form

Z =

1
2

∂αβMαβ +

1
2

∆ ,

(3.11)

where the operator ∆ is given by (2.11).

For n > 0, a massive superﬁeld, Eα1···αn = ¯Eα1...αn = E(α1···αn), is a real symmetric

rank-n spinor which obeys the diﬀerential conditions [45]

¯DβEβα1···αn−1 = DβEβα1···αn−1 = 0 =⇒ ∂βγEβγα1...αn−2 = 0 ,

∆Eα1...αn = mσEα1...αn ,

σ = ±1 .

(3.12a)

(3.12b)

8

Due to the identity

eqs. (3.12) lead to the mass-shell equation

✷ = ∆2 +

1

16(cid:8)D2, ¯D2(cid:9) ,

One may also check that

(✷ − m2)Eα1...αn = 0 .

∆Eα1...αn = ∂β

(α1Eα2...αn)β ,

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

as a consequence of (3.12a). We conclude that Eα1...αn is an eigenvector of the superhelicity
operator (3.11),

ZEα1...αn = mκEα1...αn ,

κ =

1
2

(n + 1)σ .

(3.16)

For completeness, we also consider massive scalar superﬁelds. The massive multiplet
2 σ is described by a real scalar superﬁeld Gσ = ¯Gσ, which is

2 ≡ 1

of superhelicity κσ = ± 1
constrained by

∆Gσ = mσGσ ,

(3.17)

with m > 0 the mass parameter. This equation implies that Gσ is linear, ¯D2Gσ = D2Gσ =
0. It follows from (3.17) that ZGσ = mκσGσ.

Constraint (3.17) is the equation of motion for a supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory

with action

SCS[V ] = −

1

2Z d3xd2θd2 ¯θnG2 − mσV Go ,

G := ∆V ,

(3.18)

with V the gauge prepotential of the vector multiplet.

The superhelicity κ = 0 multiplet is described by a chiral superﬁeld Φ, ¯DαΦ = 0,

constrained by

D2Φ + m ¯Φ = 0 .

This is the equation of motion for the model

4 Massless half-integer superspin multiplets

We ﬁx an integer s > 1 and consider two sets of superﬁeld dynamical variables:

V ⊥ =(cid:8)Hα(2s), Γα(2s−2), ¯Γα(2s−2)(cid:9) ;
V k =(cid:8)Hα(2s), Gα(2s−2), ¯Gα(2s−2)(cid:9) .

In both case Hα(2s) = H(α1α2....α2s−1α2s) is an unconstrained real superﬁeld. The complex
superﬁelds Γα(2s−2) = Γ(α1...α2s−2) and Gα(2s−2) = G(α1...α2s−2) are transverse and longitudi-
nal, respectively.

We postulate the following linearised gauge transformations for the dynamical super-

ﬁelds introduced

Here the complex gauge parameter gα(2s) = g(α1...α2s) is an arbitrary longitudinal linear
superﬁeld. It can be expressed in terms of an unconstrained complex parameter Lα(2s−1) =
L(α1...α2s−1) by the rule

(4.6)
Since the gauge-transformations are linearised, only the Lα(2s−1) and ¯Lα(2s−1) fermionic
gauge-parameter superﬁelds can appear in the gauge-transformation.

gα(2s) = ¯D(α1Lα2...α2s) .

The two sets of dynamical variables, V ⊥ and V k, give rise to two gauge-invariant

actions, transverse and longitudinal ones, which are dual to each other.

Let us introduce unconstrained prepotentials, ξα(2s−1) and ζα(2s−3), for the constrained
superﬁelds Γα(2s−2) and Gα(2s−2) according to the rule (2.4). The gauge transformations
of Γα(2s−2) and Gα(2s−2) are induced by the following variations of the prepotentials

4.2 Longitudinal formulation

In accordance with our general discussion in section 2, the theory with action (4.9)
possesses a dual formulation. It is obtained by considering the following ﬁrst-order action

Here Vα(2s−2) is an unconstrained complex superﬁeld, while the Lagrange multiplier Gα(2s−2)
is constrained to be a complex longitudinal linear superﬁeld. With the normalisation of
the Lagrange multiplier chosen, the action (4.14) proves to be invariant under the gauge
transformations (4.3) and (4.5) accompanied by

Varying (4.14) with respect to Gα(2s−2) gives Vα(2s−2) = Γα(2s−2), and then (4.14)
reduces to the transverse action (4.9). On the other hand, we can ﬁrst consider the
equation of motion for Vα(2s−2) and its conjugate, which imply

This action is invariant under the gauge-transformations (4.3) and (4.5). It deﬁnes the

minimal N = 2 Poincar´e supergravity [13].

Varying the action (4.21) with respect to the gravitational superﬁeld H αβ, one obtains

the gauge-invariant ﬁeld strength

which is constructed solely in terms of the gravitational superﬁeld Hαβ. The gauge-
invariant superﬁeld Wαβ proves to be a linearised form of the N = 2 super-Cotton tensor
[18, 20]. The linearised expression (4.24) was recently given in [46]. Our analysis shows
that the gauge-invariant ﬁeld strength Wαβ naturally follows from the results of the earlier
work [13].

In the supergravity framework, the super-Cotton tensor transforms homogeneously
under the super-Weyl transformations [18] (see also [19] for a more general supergravity
formulation). A direct consequence of this result is that the linearised version of the
super-Cotton tensor Wαβ, given by eq. (4.24), is a primary superﬁeld with respect to the
superconformal group.

It is an instructive exercise to show that

∆Ek

αβ = −

Using this relation gives an alternative expression for the ﬁeld strength (4.24).

Direct calculations show that Wαβ is transverse linear,

¯DβWαβ = DβWαβ = 0 .

(4.25)

(4.26)

This relation is a linearised form of the Bianchi identity for the N = 2 super-Cotton
tensor [19]. It follows from (4.26) that the functional

SCSG =Z d3|4z H αβWαβ(H)

(4.27)

is invariant under the gauge transformation (4.22a). This functional is a linearised version
[46] of the N = 2 conformal supergravity action [30, 31].

Let us now look at the transverse formulation for the s = 1 case. It is given by the

5 Component analysis

The linearised gauge transformations (4.3)–(4.5) make use of the longitudinal linear
parameter gα(2s), given by eq. (4.6), and its conjugate ¯gα(2s). The most general expression
for ga(2s) as a power series in the Grassmann variables θ and ¯θ, is

gα(2s)(θ, ¯θ) = eiH0ngα1...α2s + ¯θ(α1ξα2...α2s) + θβΥα1...α2s,β + θ2fα1...α2s
+ θβ ¯θ(α1λα2...α2s),β + θ2 ¯θ(α1Σα2...α2s)o ,

(5.1)

where

H0 := θα(γm)αβ ¯θβ∂m = θα ¯θβ∂αβ ≡ ραβ∂αβ ,

ραβ := θ(α ¯θβ) .

(5.2)

All component ﬁelds in (5.1) are complex and symmetric in the indices α1, . . . , α2s. The
components Υα1...α2s,β and λα1...α2s−1,β are not required to have any symmetry property
relating their α and β indices, which is indicated by a coma.
In other words, Υα(2s),β
belongs to the tensor product (2s + 1) ⊗ 2 of SL(2, R).

As follows from the gauge transformation (4.3), the component gauge parameters
gα(2s), Υα(2s),β and fα(2s) in (5.1) can be used to choose a Wess-Zumino gauge of the form:

Hα1...α2s(θ, ¯θ) = i θ ¯θ Dα1...α2s + θ(β ¯θγ)Eα1...α2s,βγ + ¯θ2θβΨα1...α2s,β − θ2 ¯θβ ¯Ψα1...α2s,β

+θ2 ¯θ2Aα1...α2s ,

(5.3)

15

where the composite scalar θ ¯θ = θα ¯θα is imaginary. All bosonic ﬁelds in (5.3) are real. So
far no gauge condition has been imposed on Γα1...α2s−2. To preserve the gauge condition
(5.3), some of the gauge parameters contained in (5.1) must be constrained as follows:

gα1...α2s = −

i

gα1...α2s = 0 ,

ζα1...α2s ,

Λα1...α2s := λ(α1...α2s−1,α2s) ,

Λα2...α2s−2 := λα2...α2s−2β,

β .

(5.6)

We recall that the composite ραβ is deﬁned by (5.2). It is clear from (4.3), (5.1), (5.3) and
(5.5) that the imaginary part of Λα(2s) can be used to gauge away the component ﬁeld
Dα(2s) thus arriving at the stronger Wess-Zumino gauge

Hα1...α2s(θ, ¯θ) = θ(β ¯θγ)Eα1...α2s,βγ + ¯θ2θβΨα1...α2s,β − θ2 ¯θβ ¯Ψα1...α2s,β

+ θ2 ¯θ2Aα1...α2s ,

in which the residual Λ-invariance is described by a real parameter,

¯Λα(2s) = Λα(2s) ≡ lα(2s) .

(5.7)

(5.8)

The real bosonic ﬁeld Eα1...α2s,βγ transforms in the representation (2s + 1) ⊗ 3 of
SL(2, R), while the complex fermionic ﬁeld Ψα1...α2s,β belongs to the (2s + 1) ⊗ 2. The
ﬁeld Eα(2s),βγ is a higher spin analogue of the linearised vielbein (or frame ﬁeld), which
becomes obvious if we convert the spinor indies of Eα(2s),βγ into vector ones by the standard
rule

interpretation is conﬁrmed by the fact that the gauge transformation associated with the

δEα1...α2s,βγ = ∂βγζα1...α2s ⇐⇒ δEm

a1...as = ∂mζ a1...as .

(5.10)

16

The gauge transformation generated by the parameter (5.8) acts on Eα1...α2s,βγ as a higher
spin counterpart of the linearised local Lorentz transformation. Therefore the tensor
a...αs and its gauge freedom correspond to the 3D massless spin-(s + 1)
structure of Em
gauge ﬁeld, see e.g. [47]. In the frame-like formulation for massless higher spin ﬁelds [47],
a...αs and the other is a
one introduces two independent gauge ﬁelds, one of which is Em
a...αs
higher spin analogue of the Lorentz connection. The latter is expressed in terms of Em
on the equations of motion. However, in the oﬀ-shell formulations for supergravity, no
independent Lorentz connection appears. And its higher spin analogue never appears in
the framework of oﬀ-shell higher spin supermultiplets [5, 6, 7].

Recalling the gauge transformation law of Γα(2s−2), eq. (4.4), one may see that the
gauge freedom associated with the parameters Λα(2s−2) in (5.5) and Σα(2s−1) in (5.1) allows
us to bring Γα(2s−2) to the following form:

Γα1...α2s−2(θ, ¯θ) = eiθλ ¯θρ∂λρhθβω(βα1...α2s−2) + θ(α1
+ θ2 ¯θβρ(βα1...α2s−2)i .

¯Ψα2...α2s−2)

+ θ2Bα1...α2s−2 + ¯θβθγU(βγα1...α2s−2) + ¯θβθ(βFα1...α2s−2)

(5.11)

The fermionic ﬁelds Ψα1...α2s,β in (5.7) and Ψα1...α2s−3 appearing in ¯Γα1...α2s−2 constitute a
complex version of the massless spin-(s + 1
2) ﬁeld reviewed in Appendix B.2. The complex
fermionic ﬁelds ωα(2s−1) and ρα(2s−1) in (5.11) turn out to be auxiliary for the theory with
action (4.9) in the standard sense that they become functions of the other fermionic ﬁelds
on the mass shell. The real bosonic ﬁeld Aα(2s) in (5.7) and the complex bosonic ﬁelds
Bα(2s−2), Uα(2s) and Fα(2s−2) in (5.11) are auxiliary for the theory with action (4.9).

Now we are can argue that, upon elimination of the auxiliary ﬁelds, the theory with
action (4.9) is equivalent to a sum of two massless (Fang-)Fronsdal models, one of which
is the bosonic spin-(s + 1) model described in Appendix B.1 and the other corresponds to
two identical fermionic spin-(s+1/2) models described in Appendix B.2. Equivalently, the
fermionic sector describe a complex massless spin-(s + 1/2) gauge ﬁeld. Indeed, consider
the frame ﬁeld in (5.7). It can be represented as the sum of three irreducible components,

ρβγEα1...α2s,βγ = ρβγhα1...α2sβγ + ρβ

(α1mα2...α2s)β + ρ(α1α2hα3...α2s) ,

(5.12)

where the irreducible components of Eα1...α2s,βγ are deﬁned by

hα1...α2s+2 := E(α1...α2s,α2s+1α2s+2) ,

mα1...α2s := −

(5.13c)

The ﬁeld mα(2s) may be algebraically gauged away by the generalised Lorentz transforma-
tion described by the parameter (5.8). The remaining bosonic ﬁelds hα(2s+2) and hα(2s−2)
correspond to the dynamical variables of the Fronsdal spin-(s + 1) model reviewed in
Appendix B.1. As follows from (5.10), their gauge freedom is equivalent to that of the
massless spin-(s + 1) gauge ﬁeld, see eqs. (B.2). Since the requirement of gauge invari-
ance ﬁxes the Fronsdal action modulo an overall numerical factor, we are conﬁdent the
theory (4.9) leads to the Fronsdal spin-(s + 1) model even without explicit calculation
of the component bosonic action. Such a calculation may be carried out in complete
analogy with the 4D case described in [7]; we will not consider it here. Let us turn to the
fermionic sector and represent the higher-spin gravitino Ψα1...α2s,β in (5.7) as the sum of
two irreducible components,

Ψα1...α2s,β = Ψα1...α2sβ + εβ(α1Ψα2...α2s) ,

(5.14)

where the irreducible components of are deﬁned by

Ψα1...α2sβ := Ψ(α1...α2s,β) ,

Ψα1...α2s−1 :=

(5.15a)

(5.15b)

These complex fermionic ﬁelds Ψα(2s+1), Ψα(2s−1) as well as Ψα(2s−3) sitting in ¯Γα(2s−2)
constitute a complex version of the massless spin-(s + 1
2) ﬁeld reviewed in Appendix
B.2. Under the fermionic local symmetry generated by the complex parameter ξα(2s−1) in
(5.1), the gauge transformation law of these ﬁelds is equivalent to the complex version of
the transformation (B.13) which corresponds to the massless spin-(s + 1/2) ﬁeld. Since
the requirement of gauge invariance ﬁxes the Fang-Fronsdal action modulo an overall
numerical factor, we are conﬁdent the theory (4.9) leads to the massless spin-(s + 1/2)
model even without explicit calculation of the component fermionic action.

Instead of dealing with the gauge (5.7) and (5.11), sometimes it is more convenient to

work with an alternative Wess-Zumino gauge deﬁned by

Hα1...α2s(θ, ¯θ) = θβ ¯θγh(βγα1...α2s) + ¯θ2θβΨ(βα1...α2s) − θ2 ¯θβ ¯Ψ(βα1...α2s)

Here the bosonic ﬁelds hα(2s), hα(2s−2) and Aα(2s) are real, and the ﬁelds Bα(2s−2), Uα(2s)
and Fα(2s−2) are complex.

6 Superconformal higher spin multiplets

In this section we develop a superspace setting for linearised higher spin conformal
supergravity. We start with a review of a review of the conformal Killing supervector
ﬁelds of 3D N = 2 Minkowski superspace [48, 49], which are deﬁned in complete analogy
with the 4D N = 1 case [11].

6.1 Conformal Killing supervector ﬁelds

Consider a real supervector ﬁeld ξ on Minkowski superspace,

ξ = ξBDB := ξb∂b + ξβDβ + ¯ξβ ¯Dβ = −

ξβγ∂βγ + ξβDβ + ¯ξβ ¯Dβ .

(6.1)

It is called a conformal Killing supervector ﬁeld if it obeys the equation

[ξ + K βγMβγ, Dα] + δρDα = 0 ⇐⇒ [ξ + K βγMβγ, ¯Dα] + δρ ¯Dα = 0 ,

(6.2)

for some Lorentz (K βγ = K γβ = ¯K βγ) and super-Weyl (ρ) parameters. We recall that
the Lorentz generator Mβγ acts on a spinor ψα by the rule

Mβγψα = εα(βψγ) =

1
2

(εαβψγ + εαγψβ) .

(6.3)

The super-Weyl transformation of the covariant derivatives is deﬁned according to [13]

δρDα =

(3¯ρ − ρ)Dα + (Dλρ)Mλα ,

(3ρ − ¯ρ) ¯Dα + ( ¯Dλ ¯ρ)Mλα ,

where the parameter ρ is chiral,

Eq. (6.2) can be rewritten in the form [49]

[ξ, Dα] = −Kα

Dαξβγ + 4iδ(β

¯ξγ) = 0 ⇐⇒ ¯Dαξβγ − 4iδ(β

(6.6)

and therefore the spinor components ξα and ¯ξα of ξ are determined in terms of the vector
ones,

ξα = −

i

¯ξα = −

i

Dβξαβ ,

and the vector component ξαβ = ξβα = ¯ξαβ is longitudinal linear,

D(αξβγ) = 0 ,

¯D(αξβγ) = 0 ,

and therefore ξαβ is an ordinary conformal Killing vector,

∂(αβξγδ) = 0 .

These relations imply that D2ξαβ = ¯D2ξαβ = 0, and therefore ξα is chiral,

¯Dαξβ = 0 .

(6.7)

(6.8)

(6.9)

(6.10)

It follows from (6.2), or its equivalent form (6.5), that the Lorentz and super-Weyl pa-
rameters, Kαβ and ρ, are uniquely expressed in terms of the components of the conformal
Killing supervector ﬁeld as follows:

Kαβ = D(αξβ) = − ¯D(α ¯ξβ) ,
(Dαξα + 3 ¯Dα ¯ξα) .

ρ =

(6.11a)

(6.11b)

We also deduce from (6.2) that the Lorentz and super-Weyl parameters are related to
each other as

DαK βγ = δα

(βDγ)ρ .

(6.12)

Using the properties (6.5) – (6.10), one can explicitly check that ρ deﬁned by (6.11b) is
chiral.

6.2 Primary linear superﬁelds

A symmetric rank-n spinor superﬁeld Φα1...αn is said to be primary of dimension 1

2(x+y)

if its superconformal transformation is

δξΦα1...αn = ξΦα1...αn + nK β

(α1Φα2...αn)β + (xρ + y ¯ρ)Φα1...αn .

(6.13)

20

for some real parameters x and y. The R-charge of Φα(n) is proportional to 1

2(x − y).

Let Gα1...αn be a longitudinal linear superﬁeld constrained by (2.1b). Requiring Gα1...αn

to be primary ﬁxes one of the superconformal parameters in (6.13),

δξGα1...αn = ξGα1...αn + nK β

Let Γα1...αn be a transverse linear superﬁeld constrained by (2.1a). Requiring Γα1...αn to
be primary ﬁxes one of the superconformal parameters in (6.13),

δξΓα1...αn = ξΓα1...αn + nK β

(α1Γα2...αn)β +(cid:16)xρ + (1 +

)¯ρ(cid:17) Γα1...αn .

(6.15)

An analysis of constrained primary superﬁelds were given by Park [48].

Now, let us come back to the gauge transformation law (4.3). We postulate that the
real gauge prepotential Hα(2s) and the right-hand side of (4.3) are primary. Then it follows
from (6.14) that the superconformal transformation of Hα(2s) is

δHα1...α2s = ξHα1...α2s + 2sK β

(α1Hα2...α2s)β − s (ρ + ¯ρ) Hα1...α2s ,

(6.16)

and the dimension of Hα(2s) is equal to (−s).

Let Wα1...αn be a real transverse linear superﬁeld,

DβWβα1...αn−1 = ¯DβWβα1...αn−1 = 0 .

(6.17)

Requiring it to be primary, we deduce from (6.15) that the superconformal transformation
of Wα(n) is

δWα1...αn = ξWα1...αn + nK β

(α1Wα2...αn)β +(cid:16)1 +

n

2(cid:17) (ρ + ¯ρ)Wα1...αn ,

(6.18)

and the dimension of Wα(n) is equal to (1 + n/2).

6.3 Linearised higher spin conformal supergravity

Consider an action of the form

S = (i)nZ d3|4z H α1...αnWα1...αn ,

(6.19)

where Hα(n) is a real symmetric rank-n spinor superﬁeld with the superconformal trans-
formation

δHα1...αn = ξHα1...αn + K β

(α1Hα2...αn)β −

n
2

(ρ + ¯ρ) Hα1...αn ,

(6.20)

21

which coincides with (6.16) for n = 2s. The action (6.19) is invariant under the super-
conformal transformations (6.18) and (6.20). Moreover, it is also invariant under gauge
transformations of the form

δHα(n) = gα(n) + ¯gα(n) ,

δWα1...αn = 0 ,

gα1...αn = ¯D(α1Lα2...αn) ,

(6.21)

where the complex gauge parameter gα(n) is an arbitrary longitudinal linear superﬁeld.
The gauge invariance follows from (6.17). This gauge transformation law reduces to (4.3)
for n = 2s. We would like to realise Wα(n) as a gauge-invariant ﬁeld strength, Wα(n)(H),
constructed from the prepotential Hα(n). Then (6.19) may be interpreted as a higher spin
extension of the linearised conformal supergravity action (4.27).

Given a prepotential Hα(n) = Hα1...αn with the superconformal transformation law
(6.16) and the gauge transformation (6.21), we associate with it a gauge-invariant real
ﬁeld strength Wα(n)(H) deﬁned by

check that

Z d3|4z eH α1...αnWα1...αn(H) =Z d3|4z H α1...αnWα1...αn(eH) ,

(6.23)

for arbitrary superﬁelds Hα(n) and eHα(n) that are bosonic for even n and fermionic for

odd n. The ﬁeld strength obeys the Bianchi identities

DβWβα1...αn−1 = 0,

¯DβWβα1...αn−1 = 0 .

(6.24)

These Bianchi identities are compatible only with the superconformal transformation law
(6.18), and thus Wα(n) is a primary superﬁeld.

In the case of the half-integer superspin transverse formulation, the superconformal
ﬁeld strength Wα(2s) can be expressed in terms of the gauge-invariant ﬁeld strengths (4.11)
as follows:

SCS[H] =(cid:18)−

(7.1)

(7.2)

with the ﬁeld strength Wα(2s)(H) given by (6.22). The coupling constant λ in (7.1) is
dimensionless. In accordance with (6.16), the dimension of Hα(2s) is equal to (−s). To
make the action dimensionless, the ﬁrst term in (7.1) is rescaled by an overall factor µ2s−1
with the positive parameter µ of unit mass dimension.

In the s = 1 case, the action (7.1) coincides with the linearised action for topologically

massive N = 2 supergravity in the non-minimal w = −1 formulation [26].

Since SCS[H] does not involve the compensating superﬁeld Γα(2s−2) and its conjugate,
it follows that the corresponding equations of motion are the same for both the massive
(7.1) and massless theories (4.9):

Fα(2s−1) = 0 =⇒ DβE⊥

βα(2s−1) = 0 .

(7.3)

However, the addition of the Chern-Simons term results in the following modiﬁcation to
the Hα(2s) equation of motion for the massive theory:

µ2s−1E⊥

α(2s) + λWα(2s) = 0 .

(7.4)

This is a gauge-invariant higher-derivative superﬁeld equation.9

9As demonstrated in [42], the general second-order 3D massive ﬁeld equations for positive integer
spin, and their “self-dual” limit to ﬁrst-oder equations, are equivalent to gauge-invariant higher-derivative
equations.

23

Once the equations of motion (7.3) hold, one can obtain a simpliﬁed expression for

Wα(2s). It is

Wα(2s) = − ∆✷s−1E⊥

α(2s) .

(7.5)

Using this result, we can extract a ‘higher-superspin’ analogue of the Klein-Gordon equa-
tion from the equation of motion (7.4) as follows. First note that

0 = m2s−1E⊥
0 = µ2s−1∆E⊥

α(2s) − 2λ✷s−1∆2E⊥

=⇒

α(2s) = (µ2s−1∆ − 2λ✷s)E⊥

This leads to

α(2s) = 0 ,

m :=

|λ|1/(2s−1) .

α(2s), we deduce from (7.7) the ordinary

By making use of the Fourier transform of E⊥

It then follows from (7.4) that

α(2s) = 0 .

∆E⊥

α(2s) = mσE⊥

It remains to recall that

(7.6)

(7.7)

(7.8)

βα(2s−1) = ¯DβE⊥
The equations (7.9a) and (7.9b) tell us that E⊥

βα(2s−1) = 0 .

α(2s) is a massive superﬁeld of superhelicity

(7.10)

with the longitudinal action Sk
[H, G, ¯G] given by eq. (4.17). Since SCS[H] does not
involve the compensating superﬁeld Gα(2s−2) and its conjugate, the equation of motion for
Gα(2s−2) is the same as in massless theory, eq. (4.20). Due to the Bianchi identity (4.19),
we obtain

s+ 1

Bα(2s−3) = 0 =⇒ DβEk
However, the equation of motion for Hα(2s) becomes

βα(2s−1) = 0 .

µ2s−1Ek

α(2s) + λWα(2s) = 0 .

(7.11)

(7.12)

This demonstrates that the massive models (7.1) and (7.10) possess equivalent dynamics.

In the s = 1 case, the action (7.10) coincides with the linearised action for topologically

massive N = 2 supergravity in the minimal (1,1) formulation [26].

8 Concluding comments

The main results of this paper are as follows. In section 4 we constructed the two dually
equivalent oﬀ-shell formulations for the massless superspin-(s+1/2) multiplet, with s > 1,
as 3D analogues of the oﬀ-shell 4D N = 1 massless multiplets of half-integer superspin
[5].
In section 6 we presented the linearised higher-spin super-Cotton tensors and the
linearised actions for higher spin conformal supergravity. In section 7 we constructed the
oﬀ-shell formulation for massive superspin-(s + 1/2) multiplets, with s > 1, as higher-spin
extensions of the oﬀ-shell topologically massive N = 2 supergravity theories [26].

This paper does not include any 3D analogues of the oﬀ-shell 4D N = 1 massless
multiplets of integer superspin [6]. We have constructed such extensions. However, they
do not admit massive deformation of the type described in section 7. That is why we
will discuss these models elsewhere. This paper does not include any 3D analogues of
the oﬀ-shell 4D N = 1 higher spin supermultiplets in anti-de Sitter space [7]. We have
constructed such extensions. They will be discussed elsewhere.

To the best of our knowledge, no oﬀ-shell 3D N = 1 massive higher spin supermultiplet
have appeared in the literature. They can be derived by carrying out the plain superspace
reduction N = 2 → N = 1 to the models presented in section 7. This is an interesting
technical problem to work out.

Our results on the linearised higher spin super-Cotton tensors provide necessary pre-
requisites for developing a superspace approach to higher spin N = 2 conformal super-
gravity. We recall that the most powerful formulation for 3D N -extended conformal
supergravity is the conformal superspace of [19], which is a 3D analogue of the 4D con-
formal superspace formulations initiated by Butter [50, 51]. In this approach, it is the
N -extended super-Cotton tensor which fully determines the superspace geometry of con-
formal supergravity. It is necessary to mention that the program of constructing a super-
conformal theory of massless higher spin ﬁelds in (2+1) spacetime dimensions was put
forward long ago by Fradkin and Linetsky [52] in the component setting. However, it
appears that superspace techniques may oﬀer new insights.

Our approach to constructing higher spin massive supermultiplets is a generalisation
of topologically massive (super)gravity. Recently, there has appeared a conceptually dif-
ferent way to generate 3D massive (super)gravity theories – new massive (super)gravity
theories [53, 54, 55, 56] and their generalisations, see [45, 57] and references therein. We
believe that our results may be used to construct higher spin analogues of these massive
theories.

B Massless higher spin actions in three dimensions

In this appendix we brieﬂy review the (Fang-)Fronsdal actions for massless higher spin
ﬁelds in three dimensions [1, 2]. We also show that these models describe no propagating
degrees of freedom, as a simple extension of the 4D analysis in section 6.9 of [11].

B.1

Integer spin

Given an integer s > 1, we consider the following set of real bosonic ﬁelds

ϕi =nhα(2s) , hα(2s−4)o

deﬁned modulo gauge transformations

δhα(2s) = ∂(α1α2ζα3...α2s) ,

is gauge invariant. The requirement of gauge invariance determines the action uniquely
modulo an overal constant. The theory admits a formal limit to the case of three-
dimensional Maxwell’s electrodynamics It is obtained by setting s = 1, removing the
second ﬁeld in (B.1), and switching oﬀ all the terms in the second and third lines of the
action (B.3).

(B.4b)

We now show that the model under consideration has no propagating degrees of freedom.

The gauge freedom (B.2) allows us to gauge away the ﬁeld hα(2s−4),

hα(2s−4) = 0 .

(B.5)

In this gauge, there still remains a residual gauge freedom. In accordance with (B.2b),
the gauge parameter is now constrained by

∂β(2)ζβ(2)α(2s−4) = 0 .

(B.6)

In the gauge (B.5), the equation of motion (B.4b) reduces to ∂β(2)∂γ(2)hβ(2)γ(2)α(2s−4) = 0
and tells us that ∂β(2)hα(2s−2)β(2) is divergenceless. In general, it holds that

(B.7)

Under the two conditions that (i) the gauge parameter is constrained as in (B.6), and (ii)
∂β(2)hα(2s−2)β(2) is divergenceless, we are able to impose the gauge condition

∂β(2)hα(2s−2)β(2) = 0 ,

(B.8)

in addition to (B.5). The residual gauge freedom, which respect the conditions (B.5) and
(B.8), is generated by a gauge parameter constrained by

∂β(2)ζβ(2)α(2s−4) = 0 ,

✷ζα(2s−2) = 0 .

Due to (B.5) and (B.8), the equation of motion (B.4a) turns into

✷hα(2s) = 0 .

(B.9)

(B.10)

Since both the ﬁeld hα(2s)(x) and the gauge parameter ζα(2s−2)(x) are on-shell, it is
useful to switch to momentum space, by replacing hα(2s)(x) → hα(2s)(p) and ζα(2s−2)(x) →
ζα(2s−2)(p), where the three-momentum pa is light-like, pαβpαβ = 0. For a given three-
momentum, we can choose a frame in which the only non-zero component of pαβ =

28

(p11, p12 = p21, p22) is p22 = p11. Then, the conditions pβ(2)hα(2s−2)β(2)(p) = 0 and
pβ(2)ζα(2s−4)β(2)(p) = 0 are equivalent to

hα(2s−2)22(p) = 0 ,

ζα(2s−4)22(p) = 0 .

(B.11)

We see that hα(2s) has only two independent components, which are: h1...1 and h1...12,
and similar for the gauge parameter ζα(2s−4). The gauge transformation law (B.2a) now
amounts to δh1...1 ∝ p11ζ1...1 and δh1...12 ∝ p11ζ1...12. As a result, the ﬁeld hα(2s) can be
completely gauged away for s > 1. The case s = 1 is special. Here the ﬁeld hαβ has again
two components, h11 and h12, while the gauge parameter is a scalar, ζ. The latter allows
us to gauge away h11, since its gauge transformation is δh11 ∝ p11ζ. The other component,
h12, describes a propagating degree of freedom. In the gauge h11 = 0, it is proportional
to a single non-zero component of the gauge-invariant ﬁeld strength F a = 1
2εabaFbc, where
Fab = ∂ahb − ∂bha.

B.2 Half-integer spin

Given an integer s > 1, we consider the following set of real fermionic ﬁelds

φj =nψα(2s+1), ψα(2s−1), ψα(2s−3)o

deﬁned modulo gauge transformations of the form

δψα(2s+1) = ∂(α1α2ξα3...α2s+1) ,

δψα(2s−1) =

the massless gravitino. However, the last line in (B.14), which contains all the dependence

29

on ψα(2s−3), does not contribute in the case, due to the overall factor of (s − 1). Thus the
gravitino action follows from (B.14) by deleting the third line and then setting s = 1.

The gauge freedom (B.13c) allows us to gauge away the ﬁeld ψα(2s−3),

ψα(2s−3) = 0 .

(B.16)

In this gauge, there still remains a residual gauge freedom. In accordance with (B.13c),
the gauge parameter is now constrained by

∂β(2)ξβ(2)α(2s−3) = 0 .

In the gauge (B.16), the equation (B.15c) reduces to

∂β(2)ψα(2s−3)β(2) = 0 ,

(B.17)

(B.18)

which is preserved by the residual gauge transformations, as a consequence of (B.17).
Due to (B.17) and (B.18), it follows from the gauge transformation (B.13b) that the ﬁeld
ψα(2s−1) may be gauged away,

ψα(2s−1) = 0 .

(B.19)

Under this gauge condition, there still remains some residual gauge freedom. It is de-
scribed by an on-shell parameter ξα(s2−1), which is constrained by

∂β

α1ξα2...α2s−1β = 0 =⇒ ✷ξα(2s−1) = 0 ,

(B.20)

in addition to (B.17). Under the gauge conditions (B.16) and (B.19), the equations of
motion (B.15) amount to

∂β

α1ψα2...α2s+1β = 0 =⇒ ∂β(2)ψα(2s−1)β(2) = 0 ,

✷ψα(2s+1) = 0 .

(B.21)

Since both the ﬁeld jα(2s+1)(x) and the gauge parameter ξα(2s−1)(x) are on-shell, it
is useful to switch to momentum space, by replacing ψα(2s+1)(x) → ψα(2s+1)(p) and

30

ξα(2s−1)(x) → ξα(2s−1)(p), where the three-momentum pa is light-like, pαβpαβ = 0. As
in the bosonic case studied in the previous subsection, we can choose a frame in which the
only non-zero component of pαβ = (p11, p12 = p21, p22) is p22 = p11. Then, the conditions
pβ

α1ξα2...α2s−1β(p) = 0 are equivalent to

α1ψα2...α2s+1β(p) = 0 and pβ

ψα(2s)2(p) = 0 ,

ξα(2s−2)2(p) = 0 .

(B.22)

Thus the only non-zero components of ψα(2s+1)(p) and ξα(2s−1)(p) are ψ1...1(p) and ξ1...1(p).
The residual gauge freedom, δψα(2s+1)(p) ∝ pα(2)ξα(2s−1) allows us to gauge away the ﬁeld
ψα(2s+1) completely. A minor modiﬁcation of the above analysis can be used in the case
s = 1 to show that the massless gravitino action does not describe any propagating degrees
of freedom.
