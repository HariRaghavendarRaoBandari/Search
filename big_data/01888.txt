Introduction

Higher-spin (HS) gauge theory is based on higher symmetries associated with HS massless
ﬁelds. HS gauge symmetries are expected to become manifest at ultra high energies possibly
beyond the Planck energy. Since such energies are unreachable by modern accelerator devices
the conjecture that a fundamental theory exhibits the HS symmetries at ultra high energies
provides a unique chance to explore properties of this regime. HS symmetries severely restrict
the structure of HS theory.

The study of HS ﬁelds has long history starting from seminal papers of Dirac [1], Fierz and
Pauli [2], and others including the Tamm group [3, 4, 5]. The role of HS gauge symmetries
for massless ﬁelds in four dimensions was originally appreciated at the linearized level for
spin 3/2 by Rarita and Schwinger [6] and for any spin by Fronsdal [7].

Extension to the interacting level was not simple encountering diﬃculties of combining
nonAbelian symmetries of diﬀerent types. First positive results were obtained in eighties
of the last century in the papers by A. Bengtsson, I. Bengtsson, Brink [8, 9] and Berends,
Burgers, van Dam [10, 11] who found that the action consistent with HS gauge symmetries
in the cubic order contains higher derivatives in interactions

S = S2 + S3 + . . . ,

S3 = Xp,q,r

(Dpϕ)(Dqϕ)(Drϕ)ρp+q+r+ 1

2 d−3 ,

where the order of higher derivatives increases with spins of the ﬁelds ϕ in the vertex. Since
full HS theory necessarily involves inﬁnite towers of HS ﬁelds, such a theory is somewhat
nonlocal (note however that no higher derivatives appear at the quadratic level within the
expansion around AdS background). Of course some kind of nonlocality beyond Planck scale
should be expected of the theory anticipated to capture the quantum gravity regime.

Appearance of higher derivatives in interactions requires a dimensionful coupling constant
ρ in the action, whose origin in a theory involving only massless ﬁelds was obscure. Resolution
of this puzzle was proposed in [12, 13] via identiﬁcation of the parameter ρ with the radius
of the background (anti-)de Sitter space. In this setup, the higher derivative vertices do not
allow a meaningful ﬂat limit. This is consistent with numerous no-go statements ruling out
consistent interactions of massless HS ﬁelds in Minkowski space [14, 15].

In eighties, the fact that consistent HS interactions require non-zero cosmological con-
stant looked like a peculiarity. It acquired a much deeper interpretation after discovery of
the AdS/CF T correspondence [16, 17, 18]. The fact that HS theories are most naturally
formulated in the AdS background was conjectured to play a role in the context of the HS
holography in [19, 20, 21]. The precise conjecture on the AdS4/CF T3 correspondence was
put forward by Klebanov and Polyakov [22] while its ﬁrst explicit check was performed by
Giombi and Yin in [23]. This research triggered a great increase of interest in HS theories
and HS holographic duality (see e.g.
[24]-[38] and references therein). CF T2 duals of 3d
HS symmetries were studied in [39, 40]. The conjecture on AdS3/CF T2 HS holography
proposed by Gaberdiel and Gopakumar [41] also formed an active research direction in the
recent years.

3

One of the driving forces of the study of interacting HS theories is the hope that HS
holography may help to uncover the origin of AdS/CF T . However, the subtlety is that
despite signiﬁcant progress in the construction of actions during last thirty years [8]-[13],
[42]-[51] the full nonlinear generalization of the Fronsdal action is still unavailable. This
complicates the standard construction of the generating functional. One of the aims of
this talk is to discuss a recently proposed construction for invariant on-shell functionals [52]
conjectured to give rise to both the generating functional for boundary correlators and black
hole charges.

2 Unfolded Dynamics

2.1 General setup

Modern formulation of nonlinear HS theory [53] is based on the so-called unfolded approach
[54] which reformulates dynamics in question in terms of diﬀerential forms. The unfolded
form of dynamical equations provides a covariant generalization of the ﬁrst-order form of
diﬀerential equations

˙qi(t) = ϕi(q(t)) ,

which is convenient in many respects. In particular, since initial data can be given in terms
of the values of variables qi(t0) at any given point t0, the number of degrees of freedom in
the ﬁrst-order formulation equals to the number of dynamical variables.

Unfolded formulation is a multidimensional generalization achieved via replacement of

the time derivative by the de Rham derivative

∂
∂t

→ d = dxν∂ν

and the dynamical variables qi by a set of diﬀerential forms

qi(t) → W Ω(dx, x) = dxν1 . . . dxνpW Ω

ν1...νp

(x)

to reformulate a system of partial diﬀerential equations in the ﬁrst-order covariant form

dW Ω(dx, x) = GΩ(W (dx, x)) .

(2.1)

Here dxν are anticommuting diﬀerentials (dxνdxµ = −dxµdxν; the wedge product symbol is
implicit) and GΩ(W ) are some functions of the “supercoordinates” W Ω

GΩ(W ) = Xn

f Ω

Λ1...ΛnW Λ1 . . . W Λn .

Since d2 = 0 at d > 1 the functions GΛ(W ) have to obey the compatibility conditions

GΛ(W )

∂GΩ(W )
∂W Λ ≡ 0 .

4

(2.2)

(Not that all products of the diﬀerential forms W (dx, x) are the wedge products due to
anticommutativity of dxν.) Let us stress that these are conditions on the functions GΛ(W )
rather than on W .

As a consequence of (2.2) system (2.1) is invariant under the gauge transformation

δW Ω = dεΩ + εΛ ∂GΩ(W )
∂W Λ

,

(2.3)

where the gauge parameter εΩ(x) is a (pΩ −1)-form for a pΩ-form W Ω. Strictly speaking, this
is true for the class of universal unfolded systems in which the compatibility conditions (2.2)
hold independently of the dimension d of space-time, i.e., (2.2) should be true disregarding
the fact that any (d + 1)-form is zero. Let us stress that all unfolded systems appearing in
HS theories are universal.

The unfolded formulation can be applied to description of invariant functionals. As shown
in [55], the variety of gauge invariant functionals associated with the unfolded equations (2.1)
is described by the cohomology of the operator

which obeys

Q = GΩ(W )

∂
∂W Ω ,

Q2 = 0

(2.4)

as a consequence of (2.2). By virtue of (2.1), Q-closed p-form functions Lp(W ) are d-closed,
giving rise to the gauge invariant functionals

S = ZΣp

Lp .

In the oﬀ-shell case they can be used to construct invariant actions while in the on-shell case
they describe conserved charges. (For more detail and examples see [55].)

2.2 Properties

The unfolded formulation of partial diﬀerential equations has a number of remarkable prop-
erties.

• First of all, it has general applicability: every system of partial diﬀerential equations

can be reformulated in the unfolded form.

• Due to using the exterior algebra formalism, the system is invariant under diﬀeomor-

phisms, being coordinate independent.

• Interactions can be understood as nonlinear deformations of GΩ(W ).

5

• Unfolded formulation gives clear group-theoretical interpretation of ﬁelds and equations
in terms of modules and Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of a symmetry algebra h. In
particular, background ﬁelds are described by a ﬂat connection of h. Dynamical ﬁelds
are described in terms of h-modules while equations of motion have a form of covariant
constancy conditions.

• Local degrees of freedom are carried by 0-forms C i(x0) at any x = x0 (as q(t0)), valued
in the inﬁnite-dimensional module dual to the space of single-particle states: C i(x0)
are moduli of solutions replacing initial data in the conventional Cauchy problem. It
is worth to mention that this property of unfolded dynamics gives a tool to control
unitarity in presence of higher derivatives via the requirement on the space of zero-
forms like C i(x0) to admit a positive-deﬁnite norm preserved by the unfolded equations
in question.

• The most striking feature of the unfolded formulation is that it makes it possible to
describe one and the same dynamical system in space-times of diﬀerent dimensions.
Unfolded dynamics exhibits independence of the “world-volume” space-time with coor-
dinates x. Instead, geometry is encoded by the functions GΩ(W ) in the “target space”
of ﬁelds W Ω. Indeed, the universal unfolded equations make sense in any space-time
independently of a particular realization of the de Rham derivative d. For instance
one can extend space time by adding additional coordinates z

dW Ω(x) = GΩ(W (x)) ,

x → X = (x, z) ,

dx → dX = dx + dz ,

dz = dzu ∂

∂zu .

The unfolded equations reconstruct the X-dependence in terms of values of the ﬁelds
W Ω(X0) = W Ω(x0, z0) at any X0. Clearly, to take W Ω(x0, z0) in space MX with
coordinates X0 is the same as to take W Ω(x0) in the space Mx ⊂ MX with coordinates
x.

Such uplifting becomes most interesting provided that there is a nontrivial vacuum con-
nection along the additional coordinates z. This is in particular the case for AdS/CF T
correspondence where the conformal ﬂat connection at the boundary is extended to
the ﬂat AdS connection in the bulk with z being a radial Poincar´e coordinate.

3 Field-current-ﬁeld correspondence

The AdS4/CF T3 HS holography [22] relates the HS gauge theory in AdS4 to the quantum
theory of conformal currents in three dimensions. To see how it works from the unfolded
dynamics perspective, let us ﬁrst discuss the unfolded equations for free massless ﬁelds and
currents on the 3d boundary.

The unfolded equations of 3d conformal massless ﬁelds is formulated in terms of 0-forms
C(y|x) [56, 57] which depend on the coordinates xαβ = xβα of 3d space-time and auxiliary

6

commuting spinorial variables yα (α, β = 1, 2 are 3d spinorial indices). Unfolded equations
for conformal massless ﬁelds are

(

∂
∂xαβ ± i

∂2

∂yα∂yβ )C ±

j (y|x) = 0 ,

α, β = 1, 2 ,

(3.1)

where j = 1, . . . N is a color index.

The meaning of these equations is twofold. Firstly, they express all terms of degree two
α (x) :=
. The latter are the usual scalar and spinor ﬁelds which obey, respectively,

or higher in the y variables via x-derivatives of the ﬁelds C ±(x) := C ±(0|x) and C ±
∂

∂yα C ±(y|x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)y=0

Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations by virtue of (3.1). More precisely, the ± components
should be identiﬁed with positive- and negative-frequency parts of the solutions of free ﬁeld
equations. Note that the ﬁelds C ±(x) and C ±
α (x) are primaries of the conformal modules
underlying equations (3.1).

The unfolded equations for 3d conformal conserved currents have the rank-two form [58]

(cid:26) ∂
∂xαβ −

∂2

∂y(α∂uβ)(cid:27) J(u, y|x) = 0 .

(3.2)

J(u, y|x) contains all 3d HS currents along with their derivatives.

Elementary 3d conformal currents, which are conformal primaries, contain conserved

currents of all spins

J(u, 0|x) =

∞

X2s=0

uα1 . . . uα2sJα1...α2s(x) ,

˜J(0, y|x) =

∞

X2s=0

yα1 . . . yα2s ˜Jα1...α2s(x)

along with the additional scalar current

J asym(u, y|x) = uαyαJ asym(x) .

Their conformal dimensions are

∆Jα1...α2s(x) = ∆ ˜Jα1...α2s(x) = s + 1

∆J asym(x) = 2 .

The unfolded equations express all other components of J(u, y|x) in terms of derivatives
of the primaries, also imposing the diﬀerential equations on the latter, which are just the
conservation conditions

for all currents except for the scalar ones that obey no diﬀerential equations.

The rank-two equation is obeyed by

J(u, y |x) =

N

Xi=1

C −

i (u + y|x) C +

i (y − u|x) .

This simple formula gives the explicit realization of the HS conformal conserved currents in
terms of bilinear combinations of derivatives of free massless ﬁelds in three dimensions.

Generally, the rank-two ﬁelds and hence conserved currents can be interpreted as bi-local
ﬁelds in the twistor space. In this respect they are somewhat analogous to space-time bi-local
ﬁelds also used for the description of currents (see e.g [29] and references therein).

To relate 3d currents to 4d massless ﬁelds we extend the 3d current equation to the 4d
massless equations. This is easy to achieve in the unfolded dynamics via the extension of
the 3d coordinates xαβ to the 4d coordinates xα ˙β, extending 3d equations (3.2) to

(cid:18) ∂
∂xα ˙α +

∂2

∂yα∂ ¯y ˙β(cid:19) C(y, ¯y|x) = 0 .

(3.3)

These are just the free unfolded equations [54] for 4d massless ﬁelds of all spins in Minkowski
space, i.e., at Λ = 0.

The analysis in AdS4, which is also simple,

In this case,
xαβ = 1
2 (xαβ + xβα) are boundary coordinates, while z−1 = xαβǫαβ is the radial coordinate.
(For more detail see [25].) At the non-linear level, the full HS theory in AdS4 turns out to be
equivalent to the theory of 3d currents of all spins interacting through conformal HS gauge
ﬁelds [25].

is performed analogously.

A rank-two ﬁeld (current) in AdS3 is equivalent to a rank-one ﬁeld in a larger space with

ten coordinates X AB = X BA

(

∂

∂X AB +

∂2

∂yA∂yB )J 3(y|x) = 0 ,

A, B = 1, . . . , 4 ,

X AB = X BA ,

X AB = (xα ˙α, xαβ, ¯x ˙α ˙β) ,

xα ˙α = (xα ˙α, εα ˙αz) .

Reduction to Minkowski coordinates xα ˙α gives 4d massless equations for all spins with
J 3 → C 4 . Mathematically this is the manifestation of the Flato-Fronsdal theorem [59]
stating that the tensor product of unitary modules associated with 3d massless ﬁelds gives
the unitary module associated with all 4d massless ﬁelds:

(3d, m = 0) ⊗ (3d, m = 0) =

∞

(4d, m = 0) .

Xs=0

(3.4)

The full system of 4d massless ﬁelds of all spins exhibits sp(8) symmetry [60, 61, 62, 57].
A rank-two ﬁeld in four dimensions describes 4d conserved currents equivalent to a rank-one
ﬁeld in six dimensions [62, 63]

C 4C 4 ∼ J 4 ∼ C 6 .

Dualities of this type can be called ﬁeld-current-ﬁeld correspondence.

The inﬁnite set of 4d massless ﬁelds of all spins s = 0, 1, 2 . . . is conveniently described by a

4.2 Current deformation

Schematically, for the ﬂat connection D = d+w the current deformation of the free equations
(4.1), (4.2) has the form

Dω4 + L(C 4, w) = 0
˜DC 4 = 0
D2J 4 = 0

⇒ 


Dω4 + L(C 4, w) + G(w, J 4) = 0
˜DC 4 + F (w, J 4) = 0
D2J 4 = 0

The sector of 0-forms of this system was analyzed in detail in [64, 65]. Here J 4 can be
interpreted either as a 4d current or as a 6d massless ﬁeld. As a result, 4d current interactions
can be interpreted as a mixed linear system of d4 and d6 ﬁelds [64]. Algebraically this is the
semidirect sum of a rank-one and rank-two systems.

An interesting question is what symmetry is preserved by the deformed system? When
unmixed, both rank-one and rank-two system are sp(8)-invariant. The question whether
sp(8) is preserved by the deformation is equivalent to that whether formal consistency of the
deformation takes place with any connection w ∈ sp(8). The analysis of this question [65]
shows that current interactions break sp(8) down to the conformal algebra su(2, 2).

AdS4 can be foliated as xn = (xa, z) , where xa are coordinates of leaves (a = 0, 1, 2,) and
the Poincar´e coordinate z is the foliation parameter. AdS4 inﬁnity is at z = 0. In these
coordinates the background connection at λ = 1 is

Using insensitiveness of unfolded equations to the extension to a larger space, the vacuum
connection can be analitically extended to the complex plane of z with all components con-
taining d¯z being zero. In these terms the generating functional for the boundary correlators
takes the form

if L(ω(C), C) is an on-shell closed (d + 1)-form for a d-dimensional boundary

describe new degrees of freedom however.

The C-dependent terms can be represented in the form

5 Nonlinear HS equations in AdS4

To explain the construction of invariant functionals we ﬁrst recall the form of nonlinear
massless ﬁeld equations of [53]. The key element is the doubling of auxiliary Majorana
spinor variables YA in the HS 1-forms and 0-forms

ω(Y ; K|x) −→ W (Z; Y ; K|x) ,

C(Y ; K|x) −→ B(Z; Y ; K|x)

(5.1)

supplemented with equations which determine dependence on the additional variables ZA in
terms of “initial data”

ω(Y ; K|x) = W (0; Y ; K|x) ,

C(Y ; K|x) = B(0; Y ; K|x).

(5.2)

An additional spinor ﬁeld SA(Z; Y ; K|x), that carries only pure gauge degrees of freedom,
plays a role of connection in Z A directions.
It is convenient to introduce anticommuting
Z−diﬀerentials dZ AdZ B = −dZ BdZ A to interpret SA(Z; Y ; K|x) as a Z–1-form,

S = dZ ASA(Z; Y ; K|x) .

(5.3)

The variables K = (k, ¯k) are Klein operators that satisfy

kwα = −wαk ,

k ¯w ˙α = ¯w ˙αk ,

¯kwα = wα¯k ,

¯k ¯w ˙α = − ¯w ˙α¯k ,

k2 = ¯k2 = 1 ,

k¯k = ¯kk

(5.4)

11

with wα = (yα, zα, dzα), ¯w ˙α = (¯y ˙α, ¯z ˙α, d¯z ˙α).

The nonlinear HS equations are [53]

dW + W ∗ W = 0 ,

dB + W ∗ B − B ∗ W = 0 ,

dS + W ∗ S − S ∗ W = 0 ,

S ∗ B = B ∗ S ,

S ∗ S = −i(dZ AdZA + dzαdzαF∗(B)kυ + d¯z ˙αd¯z ˙α ¯F∗(B)¯k¯κ) ,

where F∗(B) is some star-product function of the ﬁeld B.

Setting W = d + W + S brings equations (5.5)-(5.9) to the concise form

W ∗ W = −i[dZAdZ A + ηδ2(dz)B ∗ k ∗ κ + ¯ηδ2(d¯z)B ∗ ¯k ∗ ¯κ] ,

The simplest choice of linear functions

W ∗ B = B ∗ W .

F∗(B) = ηB ,

¯F∗(B) = ¯ηB ,

(5.12)

where η is some phase factor (its absolute value can be absorbed into redeﬁnition of B) leads
to a class of pairwise nonequivalent nonlinear HS theories. The particular cases of η = 1 and
η = exp iπ
2 are especially interesting, corresponding to so called A and B HS models. These
two cases are distinguished by the property that they respect parity [66].

where CAB = (εαβ, ε ˙α ˙β) is the 4d charge conjugation matrix and U A, V B are real integration
variables.
It is normalized so that 1 is a unit element of the star-product algebra, i.e.,
f ∗ 1 = 1 ∗ f = f . Star product (5.13) provides a particular realization of the Weyl algebra

[YA, YB]∗ = −[ZA, ZB]∗ = 2iCAB ,

[YA, ZB]∗ = 0

([a, b]∗ = a ∗ b − b ∗ a).

The left and right inner Klein operators

κ = exp izαyα ,

¯κ = exp i¯z ˙α ¯y ˙α ,

(5.15)

which enter Eq. (5.9), change a sign of undotted and dotted spinors, respectively

(κ ∗ f )(z,¯z; y,¯y) = exp izαyαf (y,¯z; z,¯y),

(¯κ ∗ f )(z,¯z; y,¯y) = exp i¯z ˙α ¯y ˙αf (z,¯y; y,¯z),

(5.16)

κ ∗ f (z, ¯z; y, ¯y) = f (−z, ¯z; −y, ¯y) ∗ κ ,

κ ∗ ¯κ = ¯κ ∗ κ .

(5.18)

To analyze Eqs. (5.5)-(5.9) perturbatively, one has to linearize them around some vacuum

solution. The simplest choice is

W0(Z; Y |x) = W0(Y |x) ,

S0(Z; Y |x) = dZ AZA ,

B0 = 0 ,

(5.19)

where W0(Y |x) is some solution of the ﬂatness condition

dW0(Y |x) + W0(Y |x) ∗ W0(Y |x) = 0 .

(5.20)

W0(Y |x) bilinear in Y A describes AdS4.

Propagating massless ﬁelds are described by the ﬁelds W(Z; Y ; K|x) even in K and ﬁelds

B(Z; Y ; K|x) odd in K

W(Z; Y ; −K|x) = W(Z; Y ; K|x) ,

B(Z; Y ; −K|x) = −B(Z; Y ; K|x) .

(5.21)

In this sector, linearization of system (5.5)-(5.9) around vacuum (5.19) just reproduces free
ﬁeld equations (4.1), (4.2).

The ﬁelds of opposite parity in the Klein operators

W(Z; Y ; −K|x) = −W(Z; Y ; K|x) ,

B(Z; Y ; −K|x) = B(Z; Y ; K|x)

(5.22)

are topological in the sense that irreducible ﬁelds describe at most a ﬁnite number of degrees
of freedom. (For more detail see [53, 67, 68]). As such they can be treated as describing
inﬁnite sets of the coupling constants in HS theory.

Invariants of the AdS4 HS theory

To explain the idea of our construction let us ﬁrst consider an example of a contractible
unfolded system of the form

It is obviously consistent and hence is invariant under gauge transformations (2.3)

dw = L ,

dL = 0 .

δw(x) = ǫ(x) ,

δL(x) = dǫ(x) .

(6.1)

(6.2)

As such it is dynamically empty since the gauge transformation allows one to gauge ﬁx
w = 0. By virtue of (6.1) it follows then that L = 0.

A more interesting system is

dw + L(W ) = L ,

dL = 0 ,

(6.3)

where L(W ) is some closed function of other ﬁelds W that obey some unfolded equations
(2.1). In the canonical gauge w = 0 it takes the form

L = L(W ) ,

dL(W ) = 0 .

13

The singlet ﬁeld L becomes a Lagrangian giving rise to an invariant action

S = ZΣ

L(W ) .

(6.4)

So deﬁned functional is independent of local variations of the integration cycle and gauge
invariant.
Indeed, being formally consistent, the system is invariant under gauge trans-
formations (2.3) with respect to the gauge parameter ǫ associated with w and the gauge
parameters εΩ associated with W Ω. In the gauge w = 0, the parameter ǫ is expressed by the
condition δw = 0 via the gauge parameters εΩ and the gauge ﬁelds W Ω

ǫ = ǫ(ε, W ) .

(6.5)

Though L is not gauge invariant under the gauge transformations of the system, it transforms
by a total derivative of a function of ﬁelds W Ω and gauge parameters εΩ. As a result, the
action S is gauge invariant.

Note that though the system dw + L(W ) = 0 is formally consistent it is not guaranteed
In fact, the Lagrangial L deﬁned by (6.3) is

that it admits a solution with regular w.
nontrivial for non-exact L(W ).

The proposal of [52] is to consider invariants resulting from the following extension of

the HS unfolded equations

W ∗ W = F (B) + L Id ,

W ∗ B = B ∗ W ,

dL = 0 ,

where W = d + W and B are diﬀerential forms of all odd and even degrees, respectively
(both in dx and dZ). An appropriate choice is

iF (B) = dZAdZ A + ηδ2(dz)B ∗ k ∗ κ + ¯ηδ2(d¯z)B ∗ ¯k ∗ ¯κ + G(B)δ4(dZ)k ∗ ¯k ∗ κ ∗ ¯κ .

G = g+O(B) , where g is the coupling constant. L(x) are x-dependent space-time diﬀerential
forms of positive even degrees since the left-hand side of (6.6) contains a product of forms
of even degrees. That it enters as a coeﬃcient in front of the unit element Id of the star-
product algebra means that L(x) is independent of Y A and Z A. As a result, application of
the covariant derivative to the right-hand side of (6.6) gives dL(x) = 0.

It should be stressed that the modiﬁcation of the system by the “Lagrangians” L does not
aﬀect the form of all equations except for the single Z, Y -independent equation proportional
to Id, which just acquires the form (6.3). The form of the Lagrangian L(W ) (6.3) now
results from the perturbative solution of the other equations, i.e., nonlinear HS equations.
The density relevant to the generating functional of correlators in AdS4/CF T3 HS holog-
raphy is a 4-form L4. The density relevant to BH entropy is a 2-form L2 (for recent progress
in this direction see [69].)

7 Conclusions

A very general property illustrated by the analysis of HS theory is that the unfolding ma-
chinery makes holographic duality manifest at the level of the unfolded formulation of HS

14

equations. Following [52], the duality extends to the level of generating functionals. The
latter can be identiﬁed with integrals of diﬀerential forms of positive even degrees valued in
the center of the star-product algebra. So deﬁned functionals are gauge invariant, coordinate
independent and can be evaluated for any boundaries and bulk solutions.

In 4d HS theory the 4-form L4 is conjectured to give rise to the generating functional for
boundary correlators while the 2-form L2 gives black-hole charges opening new perspectives
for the understanding of black-hole physics including the informational paradox [69].

As shown in [52] a similar construction applies to the HS theory in AdS3. In this case
the only Lagrangian density is a 2-form L2. An exciting peculiarity of this construction is
that the boundary functional results from the integration over a one-dimensional cycle at
the boundary (times a cycle over the complexiﬁed Poincar´e coordinate z). It is tempting to
speculate that this property expresses holomorphicity of the 2d boundary conformal theory.
By virtue of unfolded dynamics usual ﬁeld-current correspondence can be extended via in-
terpretation of further nonlinear combinations of ﬁelds with linear ﬁelds in higher dimensions.
An interesting subtlety here is that the mixing of ﬁelds in diﬀerent dimensions representing
nonlinear interactions in the original system can decrease the symmetries of unmixed ﬁelds.
This is illustrated by current interactions of massless ﬁelds of all spins in d = 4 which break
the sp(8) symmetry of free ﬁelds down to the conformal symmetry su(2, 2) ⊂ sp(8) [65].
