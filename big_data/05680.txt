Abstract

In this paper, we study the amplify-and-forward (AF) schemes in two-hop one-way relay networks.
In particular, we consider the multigroup multicast transmission between long-distance users. Given
that perfect channel state information is perceived, our goal is to design the AF process so that the
max-min-fair (MMF) signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is optimized subject to generalized
power constraints. We propose a rank-two beamformed Alamouti (BFA) AF scheme and formulate
the corresponding AF design problem as a two-variable fractional quadratically-constrained quadratic
program (QCQP), which is further tackled by the semideﬁnite relaxation (SDR) technique. We analyze
the approximation quality of two-variable fractional SDRs under the Gaussian randomization algorithm.
These results are fundamentally new and reveal that the proposed BFA AF scheme can outperform the
traditional BF AF scheme, especially when there are many users in the system or many generalized
power constraints in the problem formulation. From a practical perspective, the BFA AF scheme offers
two degrees of freedom (DoFs) in beamformer design, as opposed to the one DoF offered by the BF
AF scheme, to improve the receivers’ SINR. In the latter part of this paper, we demonstrate how this
extra DoF leads to provable performance gains by considering two special cases of multicasting, where
the AF process is shown to employ a special structure. The numerical simulations further validate that
the proposed BFA AF scheme outperforms the BF AF scheme and works well for large-scale relay
systems.

I. INTRODUCTION

The information delivery between multiple wireless devices has shown an increasing impor-
tance in up-to-date military networks, relay networks, and 5G networks [1]–[4]. The state-of-
the-art technique in this context is to use small smart access points (APs), e.g., mobile phones,
wireless relays, Wi-Fi APs, to assist information delivery between far-apart transceiver pairs.
Nowadays, a new trend is to connect the smart APs by ﬁbers, microwave or millimeter wave to
build up a cloud processing center for facilitating reliable communications. A typical example
is the cloud radio access network (C-RAN) [5]–[7], which is recently proposed as a promising
network architecture to offer a 1000x increase in capacity to support broadband applications.
The key enabling technologies in C-RANs are the cloud processors pool and fronthaul-backhaul
links. They coordinate all the base-stations in all cells as a cloud base-station and serve the
users in a jointly optimized way. In view of this, it is promising to extend the “cloud relays”
by considering the communications between devices as information delivery in a relay network.
We treat the intra-network interference as noise and try to handle the inter-network interference
by designing the AF process in the cloud center. This gives rise to the so-called cloud relay
network (C-RN) [3], [8]–[10]; see a system model example in Figure 1.

In this work, we are interested in a typical two-hop one-way relay network. In particular, we
consider the case that all the nodes, i.e., the transmitter, the receiver, and relays, are equipped
with a single antenna. This assumption is reasonable, as nodes in a D2D communication network
are usually limited by power and apparatus. In our setting, the transmitter and receiver are far-
apart, and thus they rely on the relays to amplify and forward (AF) the information,1 since the
direct link between them are negligible. We assume that the relays are distributively located, and
more importantly, they coordinate to form a C-RN. In practice, the capacity of the fronthaul-
backhaul links in C-RNs is an important issue. If the link capacity is unlimited, both the channel
state information (CSI) and received signals can be shared within the cloud, and thus the system
becomes an MIMO relay network. On the other hand, if the link capacity is limited in such a
way that only CSIs are shared and the received signals are isolated among different relays, then
the system is reduced to a distributed relay network. We remark that there are also other kinds
of relay networks corresponding to different link capacities, but in this paper we focus on the

two above.

In this paper, we are interested in relay AF design for multigroup multicast transmission. In
the literature, there are different problem formulations; see, e.g., [11]–[19]. Herein, we focus
on the max-min-fair (MMF) formulation, in which the worst user’s signal-to-interference-plus-
noise ratio (SINR) is to be maximized under generalized power constraints, such as total power
constraint, per-relay power constraints, interference temperature constraints, or energy harvesting
constraints. This makes our design approach applicable to many scenarios. A classic approach
for AF relays is to adopt the beamformed (BF) AF scheme [11], [12], which gives rise to an NP-
hard one-variable fractional quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP). An efﬁcient
way to tackle QCQP is to apply the semideﬁnite relaxation (SDR) technique [20]. That is,
we ﬁrst rewrite the fractional QCQP to a rank-one constrained fractional semideﬁnite program
(SDP). Then, by dropping the non-convex rank-one constraint, we solve the SDP in polynomial
time. It is well known that the SDR is tight if the corresponding SDP has rank-one solutions.
Otherwise, a Gaussian randomization algorithm is applied to convert the SDP optimal solution
into a feasible solution to the fractional QCQP [21], [22]. We shall call this solution the SDR
solution in the sequel. A fundamental issue here is to quantify the quality of the SDR solution.
In our previous work [9], [10], we show that the SDP always has a rank-one solution when
M + J ≤ 4, and that the SINR associated with the SDR solution is at least Ω(
M log J ) times that
associated with the optimal solution to the fractional QCQP when M + J > 4, where M is the
number of users (receivers) in the network and J is the number of generalized power constraints.
This result provides an SDR approximation bound for the one-variable fractional QCQP when
multiple constraints are present. However, from a practical perspective, it actually implies that
the SINR associated with the SDR-based BF AF scheme may experience a performance loss on
the order of 1/(M log J) in large-scale systems.

In order to improve the relay beamforming performance, we propose to adopt the Alamouti
space-time code in the AF structure. This leads to the BF Alamouti (BFA) AF scheme, in which
two beamformers are used to process two data symbols jointly. Compared to the BF AF scheme,
which uses only one beamformer to process a single data symbol, the BFA AF scheme has one
extra degree of freedom (DoF) in the beamformer design. As such, it is expected that the latter
will yield better system performance. In fact, the extra DoF available to the BFA AF scheme
is also manifested in its corresponding design problem, in that it can be shown to admit a two-

variable fractional QCQP formulation. Our analytical results show that the optimal value of
the corresponding two-variable SDP is always no worse than that of the one-variable SDP. In
addition, the SDR is tight when M + J ≤ 5, and when M + J > 5, the approximation quality
√
M log J). Clearly, both the tightness
of the SDR-based BFA AF scheme is on the order of 1/(
and approximation quality results are better than their BF AF counterparts.

The idea of using the Alamouti code in the context of single-group multicast beamforming has
been introduced in our previous work [23], where the design problem is a standard QCQP. The
subsequent conference paper [22] proposed the BFA scheme for multigroup multicasting without
relays. This paper signiﬁcantly improves [22] by generalizing the aforementioned BFA scheme to
relay networks with generalized power constraints and providing an analysis on its approximation
performance. It is worth mentioning that the authors in [24] also introduced a rank-two BF AF
scheme for relay networks. However, the scenario they focused on is single-group multicasting
in a distributed relay network with one power constraint, while our work considers multigroup
multicasting for both the distributed relay and MIMO relay networks with generalized power
constraints. We remark that the generalization from single-group multicasting to multigroup
multicasting, and from distributed relays to MIMO relays, are non-trivial. More importantly,
our work establishes for the ﬁrst time the SDR approximation quality of a fairly general class
of two-variable fractional QCQPs. It should also be noted that the problem considered in this
paper, namely beamformer design for multi-user to multi-user multigroup multicasting in relay
networks, has not been well addressed in the literature. Indeed, existing works on relay transceiver
design mainly focus on the point-to-point [14], [15], single-user to multi-user [16], multi-user
to single-user [17], [18], and multi-user to multi-user unicast [11] and multicast scenarios [19].
The work in [25] studies the rank-two relay multicasting with a direct link, while our work is
targeted at far-apart devices without direct links and our scenario setting is the more generalized
multigroup multicasting. The work in [26] studies the beamformer design in a multigroup
multicast relay network. However, it considers BF AF schemes for single-antenna relays, whereas
our focus is on rank-two BFA AF scheme under a cloud relay setting. We remark that some
efﬁcient heuristics have recently been proposed to ﬁnd a high-quality solution to one-variable
fractional QCQPs; see, e.g., [27]–[30]. We numerically compare their results with the proposed
BF Alamouti AF scheme in the the companion technical report [31], wherein we could see that
even though those heuristics can help ﬁnd a better QCQP solution, the proposed BFA AF still

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section II, we introduce the system model
and review the SDR-based BF AF scheme for both the MIMO relay network and distributed
relay network in the presence of primal users. We show how the design problem for the BF AF
scheme can be tackled by the SDR technique and introduce the existing approximation bounds
on the performance of the SDR solution. In Section III, we introduce the BFA AF scheme and
show how the corresponding design problem gives rise to a new two-variable fractional QCQP
formulation. As one of our main results, we establish an approximation bound for the SDR of the
two-variable fractional QCQP, thereby providing a performance guarantee for the proposed BFA
AF scheme. In Section IV, special cases of multicasting relay networks are studied, from which
we see how the two DoFs offered by the BFA AF scheme can improve the system performance.
Lastly, simulation results are provided in Section V, and the paper is concluded in Section VI.

different information. In total there are (cid:80)G

In this section, we describe the system model for two-hop one-way relay networks. In particu-
lar, we consider the multigroup multicast transmission by a network of single-antenna AF relays.
We assume that there are L relays in the network; G single-antenna transmitters (sources) send G
independent common information to G groups of single-antenna users (receivers, destinations);
users in the same group require the same information while users in different groups require
j=1 mj = M users in the network, where mj is the
number of users in group j, ∀j = 1, ..., G. In our target setting, the transmitters and receivers are
far-apart such that the direct link between them can be ignored. Thus, relays play an important
role during the information delivery by amplifying and forwarding (AF) received signals from
sources to destinations. By introducing the cloud relay network (C-RN) concept [8], we consider
that the relays are distributively located but connected by a cloud PUs pool (i.e., the computation
center) via fronthaul and backhaul links, which are typically ﬁbers or microwave connected to
ﬁbers. We assume that all nodes in the network are well synchronized, channels from transmitters
to relays and relays to users are frequency ﬂat, quasi-static, and the channels are perfectly
perceived by transmitters sending reference signals and then passed to the PUs pool. The PUs
pool can serve as a genie in the network to design the AF process.

A. The Beamformed AF Scheme

Let us ﬁrst introduce the traditional AF scheme, i.e., the BF AF scheme, which is widely used
in existing relay networks, e.g., [11], [12]. We begin with the information delivery process in a
one-way relay network, which is proceed by two hops:
1) Source-to-relay hop: the transmitters send information to relays. The receive model at the
relay is written as follows

channel from transmitter j to all the relays; n(t) = [n1(t), ..., n(cid:96)(t), ..., nL(t)]T with n(cid:96)(t) being
the Gaussian noise at relay (cid:96) which has mean zero and variance σ2

The weighting matrix V represents how the relays interact with each other. Speciﬁcally, we may
consider all the single-antenna relays are connected by a cloud, within which the CSIs are fully
shared. Then, if the received signals are shared within the cloud, V could be any arbitrary matrix
to be optimized, and we are dealing with an MIMO relay network [12]; if the received signals
are not shared, V is a diagonal matrix, and we are dealing with a distributed relay network [11].
Let us ﬁrst consider the MIMO relay network. The received signal for user-(k, i), i.e., user i

in group k, is given by

B. Generalized Power Constraints

Our goal is to optimize the AF process for the relay networks. Speciﬁcally, to design the AF

weighting matrix V , three design constraints are under our considerations:
1). Total Power Constraints. A natural consideration is that the total transmit power at relays

is below a given threshold. In this way, we have the total power constraint given by

which is valid for arbitrary complex matrices A, B, C, D of appropriate dimensions. Also,
¯P0 is the total transmit power budget for all the relays and D0 is deﬁned in (11) in Table I.
2). Per-relay Power Constraints. Another common design constraint is subject to the power

allowed at each relay, which can be written as

rewrite it to

wHD(cid:96)w ≤ ¯P(cid:96),

(cid:96) = 1, ..., L,

(7)

where D(cid:96) is deﬁned in (12) in Table I.

3). Interference Temperature Constraints. We may also consider a popular design constraint
in the cognitive radio (CR) network is to control the interference temperature at primal
users [32]–[34]. We consider a CR relay network with U primal users where the interference
is simply caused by the AF relays (not the transmitters). Let hu = [h1
u ]T be
the channel from relays to primal user u, ∀u = 1, ..., U. Then the interference temperature
power constraints for primal users are given by
wHGuw ≤ ηu,

u = 1, ..., U,

where ηu is the maximum interference allowed at primal user u, Gu is deﬁned in (13) in

C. A Uniﬁed AF Design Problem

In this sub-section, as depicted in Fig.2, we show how the beamformer design for different

relay networks can be captured by a uniﬁed formulation.

1) Problem Formulation for the MIMO CR Relay Network: In light of the SINR expression
in (5), we consider the MMF design approach, which maximizes the worst user’s SINR, subject
to the power constraints. This gives rise to a one-variable fractional QCQP Problem (R1BF) in
Table I. Note that we re-deﬁne p(cid:96) with p0 = ¯P0 for (cid:96) = 0 and p(cid:96) = ¯P(cid:96) for (cid:96) = 1, ..., L.

2) Problem Formulation for the Distributed CR Relay Network: As for the distributed relays,
since the AF weighting matrix here is a diagonal matrix, by a slight abuse of notation, we may
re-deﬁne w = Diag(V ) 2 and then the design problem for the distributed CR relay network can
be written as exactly the same form as that for the MIMO relay, i.e., Problem (R1BF), given
that L, Ak,i, Ck,i, D(cid:96) and Gu are deﬁned in (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), and (19) in Table I.
Note that herein the beamformer w is deﬁned differently from that in the MIMO relay network.

Fig. 2. The two-hop one-way relay network with primal users.

3) Problem Formulation for Other One-hop Relay Networks: Given that the way of interaction
between relays is different, we may formulate different AF problems for design purposes. In
fact, we could deﬁne w = vec(V ) ∈ V where V speciﬁes the prescribed possible structure of
the AF matrix. One possible scenario is that the relays are partitioned into several groups, and

is with limited capacity. This is typical when the backhaul is not powerful enough to support a
massive information sharing. In this paper, we only focus on the MIMO relay network and the
distributed relay network and provide a comprehensive performance analysis for them.

D. The SDR Technique and Approximation Bounds for One-variable QCQPs

From preceding discussions, a generalized fractional QCQP problem (R1BF) is formulated for
both the MIMO relay network and the distributed relay network. It is well known that Problem
(R1BF) is in general NP-hard [11], [20]–[22]. A classic way to tackle this NP-hard problem is
to apply the SDR technique [20], which reformulates QCQP as a rank constrained SDP problem

11

and then drops the non-convex rank constraint. Speciﬁcally, to put SDR into the context, we
use the equivalence W = wwH ⇐⇒ W (cid:23) 0, rank(W ) ≤ 1 to relax (R1BF) to (R1SDR)
as shown in Table I. It is well known that (R1SDR) can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy
by the bisection method [21], [22], where at each iteration of the bisection, an SDP problem is
solved in polynomial time [35]. Let us deﬁne

γ(W) = min

k=1,...,G;
i=1,...,mk

Ak,i • W
Ck,i • W + 1

and W (cid:63) and w(cid:63) be the optimal solutions to (R1SDR) and (R1BF), respectively. It follows that
γ(W (cid:63)) ≥ γ(w(cid:63)(w(cid:63))H), since (R1SDR) is a convex relaxation of (R1BF). The equality holds
when (R1SDR) has rank-one solutions. If rank(W (cid:63)) > 1, a feasible but generally sub-optimal

solution (cid:98)w is extracted from W (cid:63) by a Gaussian randomization algorithm [21], [22], [36]; more
speciﬁcally, see Algorithm 1 in [10]. It is easy to see that γ(w(cid:63)(w(cid:63))H) ≥ γ((cid:98)w((cid:98)w)H). We are

now interested in determining whether a reverse inequality (approximately) holds, as such an
inequality will reveal the approximation quality of the SDR solution. We summarize the prior
results in [10], [21] as follows.

Let M ≥ 1 be the total number of users in the relay network and J denote

Proposition 1 implies that the SDR-based BF AF scheme is optimal when M + J ≤ 4. However,
it will experience an SINR performance degradation when M or J is large. Speciﬁcally, in the
worst case, the approximate quality is on the order of 1/(M log J). Therefore, it may not work
well in large-scale systems.
Remark 1: Recently, there is ﬂourishing interest in using RF wave to transfer power to those
users in the system who aim at receiving energy rather than information. We usually call this
kind of users as energy receivers (ERs). As in the case with primal users, we could impose
R harvested energy constraints to the design problem [37]–[39]. In this case, Proposition 1a)

still holds by setting J = L + U + R + 1. However, a similar result to Proposition 1b) holds
only when R = 1. This statement can be proven in a similar manner as Proposition 1 by using
Theorem 2 in [40].

III. THE RANK-TWO BEAMFORMED ALAMOUTI AF SCHEME IN THE RELAY NETWORKS

Our discussions in Section II reveal that BF AF may experience serious performance degra-
dation in large-scale systems. However, in practice, the multigroup multicast transmission aims
to serve groups of users and also, each of the relay should have its own power budget, not to
mention that there may be a number of primal users if we consider the CR system. Therefore,
the inherent feature of the relay network motivates us to propose more advanced AF schemes,
for which the guaranteed performance can scale better with the problem size. We observe in
Proposition 1 that the performance degradation results from using a rank-one AF weight w to
approximate a high rank SDP solution W (cid:63). To remedy this defect, an intuition is to explore one
more DoF by introducing the Alamouti space-time code. This motivates the development of the
BFA AF scheme.

A. The Beamformed Alamouti AF Scheme for the MIMO relay

To introduce the Alamouti space-time code structure in the AF process, we parse the transmit
signal in every two time slots as a group, i.e., s(m) = [ s(2m) s(2m + 1) ]T , and transmit
s(m) in each source-to-relay hop. Speciﬁcally, following (3), for any p = 1, 2, we denote the
AF weighting matrix at time slot p as Vp = [vp
L,(cid:96)]T .
Then, the transmit signal at relay (cid:96) (for every two time slots) can be modiﬁed to

L] where vp

Phase II:   Relay to Destination 2L1By using a similar approach in identifying the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the Alamouti
coded signal in the point-to-point communication [41, Chapter 3.3.2], we can derive the SINR
expression from (20) by treating interference as white noise. Speciﬁcally, letting w1 = vec(V1)
and w2 = vec(V2), the SINR at user-(k, i) can be written as

where Ak,i, ¯Ak,i, Ck,i and ¯Ck,i are deﬁned in (9), (22), (10) and (23). More details of the BFA
AF detecting process can be found in the companion technical report [31]. Similarly, we can
obtain ¯D(cid:96) and ¯Gu in (24) and (25).

B. The Beamformed Alamouti AF Scheme for the distributed relay

The BFA AF scheme for the distributed relay is similar to that for the MIMO case, and we
defer the details of the derivations to the the companion technical report [31]. Note that for
distributed relay network, we re-deﬁne w1 = Diag(V1) and w2 = Diag(V2), which is different
from that in MIMO relay network. Therefore, the design problem for both the MIMO relay and
distributed relay can be written as a two-variable fractional QCQP problem (R2BF) in Table II.

C. The SDR Technique for (R2BF)

Problem (R2BF) is a fractional QCQP with two variables. It subsumes Problem (R1BF) when
¯A = 0, ¯C = 0 and ¯G = 0, and thus it is NP-hard. By applying SDR, we have the new AF
design problem shown in Table II, where (R2SDR) serves as a convex relaxation to (R2BF).

D. SDR Approximation Bounds for BF Alamouti AF

In this sub-section, we turn our attention to the performance analysis of the proposed BFA

AF scheme. Speciﬁcally, we proceed by answering the following three questions.

1). What is the relationship between (R2SDR) and (R1SDR)?
2). When is (R2SDR) equivalent to (R2BF)?
3). What is the approximation quality of (R2SDR)?

Our recent works [22], [23] show that for the multigroup multicast network without relays, the
design problems for BF AF and BFA AF have the same SDR, and the BFA AF scheme admits
a rank-two approximate solution. However, the design problem for relay networks gives rise to
two different SDRs, namely, (R1SDR) and (R2SDR). To answer Problem 1), it is easy to see

Proposition 2

The optimal value of (R2SDR) is always no worse than that of (R1SDR).

The proof comes from the fact that ((cid:99)W , 0) must be a feasible solution to (R2SDR), given that
(cid:99)W is feasible to (R1SDR). Intuitively, the gain also comes from the employment of one more

DoF in the transmit structure.

To address Problem 2) and 3), we have the following theorem:

Theorem 1 Consider Problem (R2SDR). Let M ≥ 1 be the total number of users in the relay
network and J denote the total number of constraints in (R1BF), i.e., J = L + U + 1 and J ≥ 1.
Let W (cid:63)
2 be the optimal solutions to Problem (R2SDR) and we consider the cases of
both W (cid:63)
a). Problem (R2SDR) can produce an optimal solution to Problem (R2BF) when M + J ≤ 5.

The proof of Theorem 1a) is similar to that for Theorem 1 in [10]; see details in Appendix A
in [10] and [42, Theorem 5.1]. We relegate the proof of Theorem 1b) in Appendix A at the
end of this paper. The signiﬁcance of Theorem 1 is twofold. First, it shows that (R2SDR) is
optimal for BFA AF when M + J ≤ 5. Then, in conjunction with Proposition 2, the proposed
method must be better than BF AF in the case of M + J ≤ 5. Second, if (R2SDR) does not
have rank-one solutions, Theorem 1 speciﬁes the quality of the SDR solution returned by the
Gaussian randomization algorithm—i.e., on the order of
8M ; on the order of
8M . If we ﬁx the number of power constraints J and increase the number of
M log J if
scales better than Ω (1/M ). Moreover, we see
users in the system, then we see that Ω
from (32) that the approximation quality is lower bounded by Ω (1/M ). Hence, in conjunction
with Proposition 2, the performance of BFA AF is provably no worse than that of BF AF.
Remark 2: One may observe that (R2BF) can be written in the form of (R1BF) by letting
w = [w1; w2] and ˜Ak,i = [Ak,i, 0; 0, ¯Ak,i]. Thus, it immediately admits the inferior bound in
Proposition 1. Moreover, if ¯Ak,i = 0, the approximation bound in Theorem 1 reduces to that in
Proposition 1. Thus Theorem 1 can be seen as a generalization of Proposition 1 from one-variable
fractional QCQPs to two-variable fractional QCQPs.
Remark 3: If we let ¯Ak,i = Ak,i and ¯Ck,i = Ck,i, Problem (R2BF) will be reduced to Problem
(R1BF) by replacing the rank-one variable w to a rank-two matrix B. We have studied the latter
in [22] by considering the multigroup multicast transmission in a network without relays, where
the SDR rank-two approximation bounds are provided based on Problem (R1SDR). Hence, our
results in Theorem 1 also generalize the approximation bounds in [22, Theorem 1].

IV. SPECIAL CASES WITH DETERMINISTIC APPROXIMATION BOUNDS

In this section, by considering some special cases of (R2BF), we will demonstrate how the
two DoFs offered by the BFA AF scheme can lead to improved performance over the BF AF
scheme. In particular, we consider special cases in both distributed relay network and MIMO
relay network, where by exploiting the special structures of the problems, we can obtain various
strengthenings of Theorem 1.

A. Multicasting for Distributed Relay Networks

For the distributed relay case, by observing the structure of Ak,i and ¯Ak,i, we can deﬁne

φ(cid:96) = arg(f (cid:96)

k) and e = [ej2φ1, ..., ej2φ(cid:96), ..., ej2φL]T with j =

√−1 such that

and

¯Ak,iw2 = (w2 (cid:12) e)HAk,i(w2 (cid:12) e)

wH
2

¯Guw2 = (w2 (cid:12) e)HGu(w2 (cid:12) e).

wH
2

Then, letting ¯w2 = w2 (cid:12) e, we actually have
¯Ak,i • w2wH

2 = Ak,i • ¯w2 ¯wH

2

and

¯Gu • w2wH

2 = Gu • ¯w2 ¯wH
2 .

On the other hand, we also have

¯Ck,i • ¯w2 ¯wH

2 = Ck,i • w2wH
2 ,

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

(37)

since Ck,i must be a diagonal matrix in the target relay network. Moreover, for distributed relays,
we have ¯D(cid:96) = D(cid:96),

∀(cid:96) = 0, ..., L, and D(cid:96)s are also diagonal. Therefore

D(cid:96) • ¯w2 ¯wH

2 = D(cid:96) • w2wH
2 ,

∀(cid:96) = 1, ..., L,

for the diagonal matrix D(cid:96). Thus, Problem (R2BF) can be rewritten as

where we have L = L. Clearly, the resulting SDR of (39) has the same optimal value as that of
(R1SDR). Moreover, it is easy to see that we have ω = 1/2 here since Ak,i = ¯Ak,i for all k, i.
Note that herein we have k = 1 for multicasting. Thus, we may conclude

This result can also be obtained by applying the approximation bound results in [22] to (R1SDR).
It is worth mentioning that prior to this proposition, the authors in [24] have provided a
similar result by introducing a phase rotation at the AF process under a total power constraint.
Nevertheless, our derivation here reveals how the two DoFs lead to a gain in performance.

B. Multicasting for MIMO Relay Networks

We also have some interesting results for the MIMO relay multicasting network. It shows that
in this case, the AF scheme possesses some special structure, which leads to an approximation
bound of Ω(

). We summarize the result in Proposition 4:

The proof is similar to that in Proposition 3, except that we now deﬁne φ(cid:96) = arg(f (cid:96)
k) and
e = [ej2φ1, ..., ej2φ(cid:96), ..., ej2φL]T ⊗ 1 such that equations (33)-(38) hold for the MIMO relay case.
This proposition reveals that for MIMO relay multicasting, the SDR approximation bound is on
√
the order of 1/(
M log J), which is deﬁnitely better than that for the BF AF counterpart. It
is worth noting that the optimal values for (R1SDR) and (R2SDR) are the same, and thus the
SINR performance is improved due to the better approximation quality. This demonstrates how
the proposed BFA AF scheme beneﬁts the system performance.

In this section, we provide numerical simulations to compare the performance of different
AF schemes and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed BFA AF scheme. We show the
numerical results for the distributed relay network in this section and defer the results for the
MIMO relay network and the comparison with the feasible point pursuit (FPP) algorithm [28],
[29] in the the companion technical report [31]. We assume w.l.o.g. that each multicast group
has an equal number of users (i.e., mk = M/G for k = 1, . . . , G). The channels fk, gk,i, where
k = 1, . . . , G and i = 1, . . . , mk, are identical independently distributed (i.i.d.) according to
CN (0, I). The transmitted signal at each transmitter is with power 0dB (i.e., Pj = 0dB for
ant, where
j = 1, . . . , G). Each single-antenna relay has the same noise power (i.e., σ2
(cid:96) = 1, . . . , L), and all users have the same noise power (i.e., σ2
user for k = 1, . . . , G and
user > 0. The total power threshold for all the
i = 1, . . . , mk). We assume that σ2
relays is ¯P0; the power threshold at (cid:96)th relay is ¯P(cid:96), where (cid:96) = 1, . . . , L. For each AF scheme,
100 channel realizations were averaged to get the plots, and the number of randomizations for
generating BF AF weights and BFA weights is 1, 000.

A. Worst User’s SINR versus Total Power Threshold

In this simulation, we vary the total power budget at relays to see the worst user’s SINR
performance in different relay networks. For ease of exposition, we consider the scenario where
only the total power constraint is present. In Figure 4, we assume that there are L = 8 single-
antenna relays and G = 2 multicast groups with a total of M = 16 users. For both cases, we
set σ2
user = 0.25. It shows that the objective value (obj.) of (R1SDR) and (R2SDR) serve
as an upper bound for the SDR-based BF AF scheme and the SDR-based BFA AF scheme,
respectively. Moreover, based on randomization, the BFA AF scheme shows a signiﬁcant SINR
improvement over the BF AF scheme in all the power regions.

ant = σ2

B. Worst User’s SINR versus Number of Users

In this simulation, we show how the worst user’s SINR scales with the number of users served
in the relay system. We consider the problem formulation with one total power constraint present.
user = 0.25 and the total power threshold at relays
In Figure 5, we have L = 8, G = 2, σ2

(R1SDR), which is consistent with Propositions 2 and 3. Moreover, it shows that BFA AF can
own better SINR performance than the BF AF scheme for all the values of M, which veriﬁes
the results in Proposition 1 and Theorem 1.

C. Worst User’s SINR versus Number of Per-relay Power Constraints

In this simulation, we consider the scenario where both the total power constraint and per-
antenna power constraints are present and the primal users are absent. Our purpose is to see how
the worst user’s SINR scales with the number of per-relay power constraints. Speciﬁcally, Figure
6 shows the distributed relay case with L = 8, G = 2, M = 16, where the total power threshold
is ¯P0 = 7dB and per-relay power threshold is also ¯P(cid:96) = −5dB. We set σ2

and vary the number of per-relay power constraints from 0 to L to compare SINR performances
of different AF schemes. It shows that the BF Alamouti AF scheme outperforms the BF AF
scheme. As the number of per-relay power constraints increases, the SINRs diverge from their
SDR upper bounds, and both BF AF and BF Alamouti AF exhibit the same scaling with L,
which is consistent with the approximation bounds in terms of J in Proposition 1 and Theorem
1.

D. Worst User’s SINR versus Number of Primal Users

Similar to previous simulations, here we show the worst user’s SINR scaling with the number
of primal users. To set up the problem, we consider the scenario where the total power constraint
and the primal users’ interference constraints are present. We assume that L = 8, G = 2 and
user = 0.25, the total power budget ¯P0 = 10dB, and the noise power at
M = 12 and set σ2
ant = σ2
all primal users to be σ2
u = 0.25. Moreover, we assume that the primal users are subject to an
interference power threshold equaling to bu = 3dB. We then increase the number of primal users
to see the SINR scaling in Figure 7. It shows that as the primal users increases, both the BF AF
scheme and BFA AF scheme diverge from their SDR bounds and BFA AF shows a signiﬁcant
improvement over BF AF. These results further validate Proposition 1 and Theorem 1 in terms
of the scaling of J.

E. Simulation Results for Multicasting Relay Networks

In this sub-section, we provide numerical results for the special cases of multicasting. In both
Figures 8 and 9, we consider the problem formulation with the total power constraint and one
primal user’s temperature constraint and show the worst user’s SINR scaling with the number
of users. Speciﬁcally, in Figure 8, we set L = 8, ¯P0 = 10dB and σ2
user = 0.25. The
simulation results show that the obj. of (R1SDR) and (R2SDR) coincide with each other, and
the curve of BFA AF scales better than that for BF AF, which is consistent with results in
Proposition 3. In Figure 9, we have L = 4, ¯P0 = 10dB and σ2
user = 0.25. It shows that
the obj. of (R2SDR) equal to that of (R1SDR). Moreover, BFA AF exhibits better scaling than
BF AF as the number of users increases. This veriﬁes results in Proposition 4.

F. Actual Bit Error Rate (BER) Performance

To further demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed AF scheme, we study the actual coded
bit error rate (BER) performance of the scenario setting in Figure 4. Speciﬁcally, for each time
slot, we simulate the actual AF process by generating sj(t), n(cid:96)(t) according to the SISO model
in (4) and (20) and detecting and decoding sj(t) at each receivers. The resulting BERs are shown
in Figures 10. To simulate the SDR bound in the BER plots, we assume that there exists an
SISO channel whose SINR is equal to γ(W (cid:63)) or θ(W (cid:63)
2 ). In our simulations, we adopt a
gray-coded QPSK modulation scheme and a rate-1/3 turbo code in [43] with a codelength of

2880 bits. We simulate 100 code blocks for each channel realization and thus the BER reliability
level is 10e−4. We see that the actual BER performance of the proposed BFA AF scheme indeed
outperforms the BF-AF scheme at almost all power thresholds. The results are consistent with
those SINR results in Figure 4 and show that BFA AF can achieve a good performance in real
applications.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have studied the AF design problem in both the MIMO relay network and
the distributed relay network. We considered different power constraints and tried to maximize
the worst user’s SINR under these power constraints in the multigroup multicasting scenario.

A novel BFA AF scheme was proposed, for which the design problem is formulated as a two-
variable fractional QCQP. Our main contributions lie in two aspects. First, we analyzed the new
two-variable fractional SDR problem. The results show that by introducing 2-DoF in the AF
structure, we can increase the optimal objective value of the SDR problem. Moreover, the quality
the SDR solution also improves, and therefore system performance can be enhanced. Second,
we showed in some special cases of relay multicasting that how the introduced one more DoF
beneﬁts the system performance and derived some interesting results, which can facilitate the
system design. In summary, we demonstrate from both theoretical and numerically ways that the
proposed BFA AF scheme can outperform the traditional BF AF scheme, especially in large-
scale systems. Our future work is the AF design under imperfect CSI scenarios and other types
of relay cloud networks with limited link capacity.

In this appendix, we provide the proof of Theorem 1 in four steps. Speciﬁcally, we begin by
considering a speciﬁc randomization time n in Algorithm 1. W.l.o.g, we let Rj and ¯Rj denote
the matrices associated with the power constraints, e.g., Rj = Gu, ¯Rj = ¯Gu or Rj = ¯Rj = D(cid:96).
Hence, herein J is the total number of generalized power constraints. Letting W1 = (ξn
