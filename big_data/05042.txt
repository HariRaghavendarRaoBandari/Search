Abstract. We study a non-homogeneous boundary value problem in a smooth bounded domain in RN . We prove
the existence of at least two nonnegative and non-trivial weak solutions. Our approach relies on Orlicz-Sobolev
spaces theory combined with adequate variational methods and a variant of Mountain Pass Lemma.

Introduction and preliminary results

Let Ω be a bounded domain in RN (N ≥ 3) with smooth boundary ∂Ω. Assume that a : (0,∞) → R is a
function such that the mapping ϕ : R → R, deﬁned by
ϕ(t) =(cid:26) a(|t|)t,

t 6= 0
t = 0 ,

is an odd, increasing homeomorphisms from R onto R. This paper studies a nonlinear boundary value
problem of the type

(cid:26) −div(a(|∇u|)∇u) = λf (x, u),

u = 0,

for x ∈ Ω
for x ∈ ∂Ω

(1)

where f : Ω × R → R is a Carath´eodory function and λ is a positive parameter.
In order to go further we introduce the functional space setting where problem (1) will be discussed. In
this context we note that the operator in the divergence form is not homogeneous and thus, we introduce
an Orlicz-Sobolev space setting for problems of this type.

The ﬁrst general existence results using the theory of monotone operators in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces were
obtained by Donaldson [6] and Gossez [8]. Other recent works that put the problem into this framework
are contained in Cl´ement et al.
[7], Gossez and Man`asevich [9], Le and
Schmitt [11], etc. In these papers, the existence results are obtained by means of variational techniques,
monotone operator methods, or ﬁxed point and degree theory arguments. The goal of our paper is to
present a new multiplicity result for equations involving nonhomogeneous operators. Thus, it supplements
the aforementioned results in the aspect that most of the papers guarantee existence but not multiplicity
of solutions.

[4, 5], Garc´ıa-Huidobro et al.

We start by recalling some basic facts about Orlicz spaces. For more details we refer to the books by
D. R. Adams and L. L. Hedberg [1], R. Adams [2] and M. M. Rao and Z. D. Ren [17] and the papers by
Ph. Cl´ement et al. [4, 5], M. Garc´ıa-Huidobro et al. [7] and J. P. Gossez [8].

For ϕ : R → R introduced at the start of the paper, we deﬁne
ϕ−1(s) ds,

Φ(t) =Z t

ϕ(s) ds, Φ⋆(t) =Z t

for all t ∈ R .

We observe that Φ is a Young function, that is, Φ(0) = 0, Φ is convex, and limx→∞ Φ(x) = +∞. Further-
more, since Φ(x) = 0 if and only if x = 0, limx→0 Φ(x)/x = 0, and limx→∞ Φ(x)/x = +∞, then Φ is called
an N –function. The function Φ⋆ is called the complementary function of Φ, and it satisﬁes

We also observe that Φ⋆ is also an N –function and the Young’s inequality holds

Φ⋆(t) = sup{st − Φ(s); s ≥ 0},

for all t ≥ 0 .

st ≤ Φ(s) + Φ⋆(t),

for all s, t ≥ 0 .

The Orlicz space LΦ(Ω) deﬁned by the N –function Φ (see [1, 2, 4]) is the space of measurable functions

u : Ω → R such that

kukLΦ := sup(cid:26)ZΩ

uv dx; ZΩ

(Φ)⋆(|g|) dx ≤ 1(cid:27) < ∞ .

Then (LΦ(Ω),k · kLΦ) is a Banach space whose norm is equivalent to the Luxemburg norm

kukΦ := inf(cid:26)k > 0; ZΩ

Φ(cid:18) u(x)

k (cid:19) dx ≤ 1(cid:27) .

For Orlicz spaces H¨older’s inequality reads as follows (see [17, Inequality 4, p. 79]):

ZΩ

uvdx ≤ 2 kukLΦ kvkL(Φ)⋆

for all u ∈ LΦ(Ω) and v ∈ L(Φ)⋆ (Ω) .

Next, we introduce the Orlicz-Sobolev spaces. We denote by W 1LΦ(Ω) the Orlicz-Sobolev space deﬁned

by

W 1LΦ(Ω) :=(cid:26)u ∈ LΦ(Ω);

∂u

∂xi ∈ LΦ(Ω), i = 1, ..., N(cid:27) .

This is a Banach space with respect to the norm

kuk1,Φ := kukΦ + k|∇u|kΦ .

We also deﬁne the Orlicz-Sobolev space W 1
5.7] we may consider on W 1

0 LΦ(Ω) the equivalent norm

0 LΦ(Ω) as the closure of C∞

0 (Ω) in W 1LΦ(Ω). By [8, Lemma

For an easier manipulation of the spaces deﬁned above, we deﬁne

kuk := k|∇u|kΦ.

ϕ0 := inf
t>0

tϕ(t)
Φ(t)

and ϕ0 := sup
t>0

tϕ(t)
Φ(t)

.

In this paper we assume that we have

1 < ϕ0 ≤

tϕ(t)
Φ(t) ≤ ϕ0 < ∞, ∀ t ≥ 0 .

The above relation implies that Φ satisﬁes the ∆2-condition, i.e.

where K is a positive constant (see [15, Proposition 2.3]).

On the other hand, the following relations hold

Φ(2t) ≤ KΦ(t), ∀ t ≥ 0 ,

kukϕ0

Φ(|∇u|) dx ≤ kukϕ0 , ∀ u ∈ W

0 LΦ(Ω), kuk < 1 ,

kukϕ0 ≤ ZΩ

Φ(|∇u|) dx ≤ kukϕ0

, ∀ u ∈ W

0 LΦ(Ω), kuk > 1 ,

(see, e.g. [14, Lemma 1]).

Furthermore, in this paper we shall assume that the function Φ satisﬁes the following condition

the function [0,∞) ∋ t → Φ(√t) is convex .

(5)

(6)

Conditions (3) and (6) assure that the Orlicz space LΦ(Ω) is a uniformly convex space and thus, a reﬂexive
Banach space (see [15, Proposition 2.2]). This fact implies that also the Orlicz-Sobolev space W 1
0 LΦ(Ω) is
a reﬂexive Banach space.
Remark. We point out certain examples of functions ϕ : R → R which are odd, increasing homeomor-
phisms from R onto R and satisfy conditions (2) and (6). For more details the reader can consult [5,
Examples 1-3, p. 243].

1) Let

with p > 1. For this function it can be proved that

ϕ(t) = p|t|p−2t, ∀ t ∈ R ,

ϕ0 = ϕ0 = p .

Furthermore, in this particular case the corresponding Orlicz space LΦ(Ω) is the classical Lebesgue space
Lp(Ω) while the Orlicz-Sobolev space W 1
(Ω). We will use the
classical notations to denote the Orlicz-Sobolev spaces in this particular case.

2) Consider

with p, s > 1. In this case it can be proved that

ϕ(t) = log(1 + |t|s)|t|p−2t, ∀ t ∈ R ,

ϕ0 = p,

ϕ0 = p + s .

3) Let

with p > 2. In this case we have

ϕ(t) = |t|p−2t

log(1 + |t|)

,

if t 6= 0, ϕ(0) = 0 ,

ϕ0 = p − 1,

ϕ0 = p .

2 The main result

In this paper we study problem (1) in the special case when

with

f (x, t) = tp−1 − tq−1 ,

1 < q < p < ϕ0

and t ≥ 0.

More precisely, we consider the degenerate boundary value problem

−div(a(|∇u|)∇u) = λ(up−1 − uq−1),
u = 0,
u ≥ 0,

for x ∈ Ω
for x ∈ ∂Ω
for x ∈ Ω.

N − ϕ0(cid:27) .

(9)

Then there exists λ⋆ > 0 such that for all λ > λ⋆ problem (8) has at least two distinct non-negative,
nontrivial weak solutions.

Remark. We point out that our result was inspired by [16, Theorem 1.2], where a related property was
proved in the case of the p-Laplace operators. The extension from p-Laplace operator to the diﬀerential
operators involved in (8) is not trivial, since the new operators have a more complicated structure than
the p-Laplace operator, for example they are non-homogeneous.

Finally, we mention that a similar study regarding the existence and multiplicity of solutions for

equations involving the p(x)-Laplace operator can be found in Mih˘ailescu and R˘adulescu [12].

Let E denote the generalized Sobolev space W 1

0 LΦ(Ω).

Deﬁne the energy functional I : E → R by

where u+(x) = max{u(x), 0}.

where u± = max{±u(x), 0} for all x ∈ Ω (see, e.g. page 52 in [4]). That fact and some standards arguments
assure that functional I is well-deﬁned on E and I ∈ C1(E, R) with the derivative given by

a(|∇u|)∇u · ∇v dx − λZΩ

Remark. We point out that if u is a critical point of I then using the above information and condition
(2) we have

(u), u−i =ZΩ

a(|∇u−|)|∇u−|2 dx ≥ ϕ0ZΩ

Φ(|∇u−|) dx.

By the above estimates and relation (4) we deduce that u ≥ 0. It follows that the nontrivial critical points
of I are non-negative solutions of (8).

The above remark shows that we can prove Theorem 1 using the critical point theory. More exactly, we
ﬁrst show that for λ > 0 large enough, the functional I has a global minimizer u1 ≥ 0 such that I(u1) < 0.
Next, by means of the Mountain Pass Theorem, a second critical point u2 with I(u2) > 0 is obtained.

Lemma 1. There exists λ1 > 0 such that

λ1 =

u∈E, kuk>1

ZΩ

Proof. First, we note that by condition (2) we can deduce that E is continuously embedded in the
(Ω). Consequently, E is continuously embedded in the classical Lebesgue

classical Sobolev space W 1,ϕ0
space Lϕ0(Ω). It follows that there exists C > 0 such that

0

On the other hand, by (5) we have

kuk ≥ CkukLϕ0 (Ω), ∀ u ∈ E.

ZΩ

Φ(|∇u|) dx ≥ kukϕ0, ∀ u ∈ E with kuk > 1.

Combining the above inequalities we obtain

ZΩ

Φ(|∇u|) dx ≥ Cϕ0ZΩ |u|ϕ0 dx, ∀ u ∈ E with kuk > 1.

The proof of Lemma 1 is complete.

Proposition 1. (i) The functional I is bounded from below and coercive.
(ii) The functional I is weakly lower semi-continuous.

Proof. (i) Since 1 < q < p < ϕ0 we have

(ii) Similar arguments as those used in the proof of [13, Theorem 2] (see also [15, Lemma 4.3]) show that
the functional I0 : E → R deﬁned by

I0(u) =ZΩ

Φ(|∇u|) dx ,

(10)

is weakly lower semi-continuous. We justify that I is weakly lower semi-continuous. Let (un) ⊂ E be a
sequence which converges weakly to u in E. Since I0 is weakly lower semi-continuous we have

I0(u) ≤ lim inf

n→∞

I0(un).

(11)

On the other hand, since E is compactly embedded in Lp(Ω) and Lq(Ω) it follows that (un+) converges
strongly to u+ both in Lp(Ω) and in Lq(Ω). (The compact embedding of E into Lp(Ω) and Lq(Ω) is a
direct consequence of the fact that E is continuously embedded in the classical Sobolev space W 1,ϕ0
(Ω)
combined with condition (7).) This fact together with relation (11) imply

I(u) ≤ lim inf

n→∞

I(un) .

Therefore, I is weakly lower semi-continuous. The proof of Proposition 1 is complete.

From Proposition 1 and Theorem 1.2 in [18] we deduce that there exists u1 ∈ E a global minimizer of

I. The following result implies that u1 6= 0, provided that λ is suﬃciently large.
Proposition 2. There exists λ⋆ > 0 such that inf E I < 0.

Proof. Let Ω1 ⊂ Ω be a compact subset, large enough and u0 ∈ E be such that u0(x) = t0 in Ω1 and

0 ≤ u0(x) ≤ t0 in Ω \ Ω1, where t0 > 1 is chosen such that

and thus I(u0) < 0 for λ > 0 large enough. The proof of Proposition 2 is complete.

Since Proposition 2 holds it follows that u1 ∈ E is a nontrivial weak solution of problem (8).

On the other hand, we point out that if u ∈ E is a critical point of J then u ≥ 0. The proof can be

Notice that since ϕ is increasing in R we have for each ξ and ψ ∈ RN
(ϕ(|ξ|) − ϕ(|ψ|))(|ξ| − |ψ|) ≥ 0 ,

with equality if and only if ξ = ψ. Thus, we can deduce that

(a(|ξ|)|ξ| − a(|ψ|)|ψ|)(|ξ| − |ψ|) ≥ 0 ,

for all ξ, ψ ∈ RN , with equality if and only if ξ = ψ. On the other hand, some simple computations show
that

(a(|ξ|)ξ − a(|ψ|)ψ) · (ξ − ψ) ≥ (a(|ξ|)|ξ| − ϕ(|ψ|)|ψ|)(|ξ| − |ψ|) ,

for all ξ, ψ ∈ RN . Consequently, we conclude that

(a(|ξ|)ξ − a(|ψ|)ψ) · (ξ − ψ) ≥ 0 ,

for all ξ, ψ ∈ RN , with equality if and only if ξ = ψ.
It follows that ∇u(x) = ∇u1(x) for all x ∈ ω := {y ∈ Ω; u(y) > u1(y)}. Hence

Using the above pieces of information we deduce that the above equality holds if and only if ∇u = ∇u1.

and thus

By relation (4) we obtain

In the following we determine a critical point u2 ∈ E of J such that J(u2) > 0 via the Mountain Pass

We obtain that (u − u1)+ = 0 in Ω, that is, u ≤ u1 in Ω. The proof of Lemma 2 is complete.

In order to ﬁnd u2 described above we prove

Lemma 3. There exists ρ ∈ (0,ku1k) and a > 0 such that J(u) ≥ a, for all u ∈ E with kuk = ρ.

By (12) and (13) we infer that it is enough to show that µ(Ωu) → 0 as kuk → 0 in order to prove Lemma
3.
Let ǫ > 0. We choose Ωǫ ⊂ Ω a compact subset, such that µ(Ω\ Ωǫ) < ǫ. We denote by Ωu,ǫ := Ωu∩Ωǫ.

The above inequality implies that µ(Ωu,ǫ) → 0 as kuk → 0.

Since Ωu ⊂ Ωu,ǫ ∪ (Ω \ Ωǫ) we have

µ(Ωu) ≤ µ(Ωu,ǫ) + ǫ

and ǫ > 0 is arbitrary. We ﬁnd that µ(Ωu) → 0 as kuk → 0. This concludes the proof of Lemma 3.
Lemma 4. The functional J is coercive.

The following result yields a suﬃcient condition which ensures that a weakly convergent sequence in
E converges strongly, too.

Lemma 5. Assume that the sequence (un) converges weakly to u in E and

lim sup

n→∞ ZΩ

a(|∇un|)∇un · (∇un − ∇u) dx ≤ 0 .

Then (un) converges strongly to u in E.

Proof. Since un converges weakly to u in E implies that it follows that (kunk) is a bounded sequence
of real numbers. That fact and relations (4) and (5) imply thet the sequence (I0(un)) is bounded, where
I0 is deﬁned by relation (10). Then, up to to a subsequence, we deduce that I0(un) → c. Furthermore,
the weak lower semi-continuity of I0 (pointed out above) implies

On the other hand, since I0 is convex (because Φ is convex), we have

I0(un) = c .

We assume by contradiction that un does not converge to u in E. Then by (4) it follows that there exist

Letting m → ∞ in the above inequality we obtain

c − ǫ ≥ lim sup

(cid:19) dx ,

and that is a contradiction with (14). It follows that un converges strongly to u in E and Lemma 5 is
proved.

Proof of Theorem 1 completed. Using Lemma 3 and the Mountain Pass Theorem (see [3] with

the variant given by Theorem 1.15 in [19]) we deduce that there exists a sequence (un) ⊂ E such that

J(un) → c > 0 and J

(un) → 0

Γ = {γ ∈ C([0, 1], E); γ(0) = 0, γ(1) = u1}.

By relation (17) and Lemma 4 we obtain that (un) is bounded and thus passing eventually to a subsequence,
still denoted by (un), we may assume that there exists u2 ∈ E such that un converges weakly to u2. Since
E is compactly embedded in Li(Ω) for any i ∈ [1, ϕ0], it follows that un converges strongly to u2 in Li(Ω)
for all i ∈ [1, ϕ0]. Hence

as n → ∞, where I0 is deﬁned by relation (10). By Lemma 5 we deduce that un converges strongly to u2
in E and using relation (17) we ﬁnd

Therefore, J(u2) = c > 0 and J

(u2) = 0. By Lemma 2 we deduce that 0 ≤ u2 ≤ u1 in Ω. Therefore

J(u2) = c > 0 and J

and thus

We conclude that u2 is a critical point of I and thus a solution of (8). Furthermore, I(u2) = c > 0 and
I(u2) > 0 > I(u1). Thus u2 is not trivial and u2 6= u1. The proof of Theorem 1 is now complete.
