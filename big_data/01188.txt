We re-examine the eﬀect of long-range Coulomb interactions on the quasiparticle velocity
in graphene. Using a non-perturbative functional renormalization group approach with partial
bosonization in the forward scattering channel and momentum transfer cutoﬀ scheme, we calculate
the quasiparticle velocity, v(k), and the quasiparticle residue, Z, with frequency-dependent polar-
ization. One of our most striking results is that v(k) ∝ ln[Ck(α)/k] where the momentum- and
interaction dependent cutoﬀ scale, Ck(α), vanishes logarithmically for k → 0. Here k is measured
with respect to one of the charge neutrality (Dirac) points and α = 2.2 is the strength of dimen-
sionless bare interaction. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the so-obtained multi-logarithmic
singularity is reconcilable with the perturbative expansion of v(k) in powers of the bare interaction.

Motivation.— In the last decade, due to excep-
tional physical properties [1–3] of graphene, the two-
dimensional all carbon material has been envisaged as a
natural candidate for various low-dimensional device ap-
plications [4–6]. But the fundamental nature of electron-
electron interactions in graphene [7] still remains unset-
tled, as explained below, despite many sincere attempts
to unravel the signiﬁcance of interaction eﬀects [8–25].

The true nature of the many-body interactions in freely
suspended graphene is manifested in the quasiparticle ve-
locity, v(k), which was experimentally [20] shown to ac-
quire a logarithmic enhancement close to one of its charge
neutrality (Dirac) points. Such a behavior was found to
be comparable to the ﬁrst-order perturbation theory [8],
i.e., v(k)/vF ≈ 1+ α
4 ln(Λ0/k) with Λ0 being the ultravio-
let cutoﬀ of the order of inverse lattice spacing of the un-
derlying honeycomb lattice and the momentum k is mea-
sured relative to the Dirac point. Here α = e2/vF ≈ 2.2 is
the strength of dimensionless bare interaction in vacuum
with e being the electron charge and vF is the bare Fermi
velocity at the Dirac points. Since α is of order unity, it
signiﬁes the failure of perturbation theory i.e., expansion
of v(k) in powers of α, in explaining the experimental
results. Moreover, due to lack of dielectric and conduc-
tion screening in freely standing and undoped graphene
the theories based on the random phase approximation
(RPA) [24] and the large-N expansion [9, 15, 18], where
N is the number of fermionic ﬂavors, does not provide
the correct physical picture.

Recently, Barnes et al. [23] not only demonstrated the
breakdown of perturbation theory but also showed that
the direct expansion of v(k) in powers of α generates a
series involving all powers of logarithms,

n ≥ 2. The superscripts correspond to the powers of
α and hence to the number of loops in the correspond-
ing Feynman diagrams. The authors of Ref. [23] also
pointed out that to order αn, n ≥ 2, the perturbation
series of v(k) contains all powers [ln(Λ0/k)]m of the ba-
sic logarithm in the range m = 1, . . . , n − 1. Thus, from
three-loop order onwards, the higher logarithmic pow-
ers start appearing in the perturbative expansion. The
numerical value of the one-loop coeﬃcient is known to
be f (1)
there
exist conﬂicting results [13, 16, 21, 23]. It is clear, how-
ever, that the above series in powers of logarithms cannot
be resumed to a power-law. Moreover, the perturbative
expansion in Eq. (1) seems to be incompatible with pre-
vious renormalization group (RG) calculations [8, 25] as
well as with resummation schemes based on the RPA [24]
which did not ﬁnd higher powers of ln(Λ0/k). This is a
clear indication of the ambiguity concerning the nature
of interaction eﬀects in graphene. Thus it is important to
understand and resolve this enigma before the material
properties (quasiparticle velocity) can be engineered [26]
for promising applications.

Motivated by this fact, we re-examine interaction ef-
fects on the quasiparticle velocity in graphene. We ar-
gue that the perturbative expansion in Eq. (1) is rec-
oncilable with the RG by showing that the higher log-
arithmic powers can be resumed with the help of non-
perturbative functional renormalization group (FRG)
ﬂow equations [27, 28] to yield an expression of the form

of undoped graphene. In order to corroborate the valid-

of Eq. (2) in powers of α reproduces the structure of the
perturbation series given in Eq. (1).

Model and method.— We describe the low-energy
physics of graphene by considering an eﬀective model
consisting of fermions with momenta close to the Dirac
points which interact via long-range Coulomb forces on
a two dimensional honeycomb lattice.
It is convenient
to decouple the interaction with the help of a Hubbard-
Stratonovich ﬁeld φ, so that our bare Euclidean action is

nents of ψpσ(K) are associated with the two sublattices of

We now write down FRG ﬂow equations for our low-
energy theory deﬁned by Eq. (3) using the momentum
transfer cutoﬀ scheme proposed in Ref. [29].
In this
scheme, we introduce a cutoﬀ Λ only in the bosonic
sector, such that it restricts the momentum transferred
by the bosonic Hubbard-Stratonovich ﬁeld to the regime
|q| > Λ. For our purpose, it is suﬃcient to work with a
sharp cutoﬀ which amounts to replacing the bare inter-
action by Θ(|q|− Λ)fq. In systems where the interaction
is dominated by small momentum transfers this cutoﬀ
scheme has several advantages [27, 29–31].
In particu-
lar, it does not violate Ward-identities related to par-
ticle number conservation.
In fact, in Ref. [29] it was
shown that in this cutoﬀ scheme the FRG ﬂow equa-
tions for the one-dimensional Tomonaga-Luttinger model
can be solved exactly to re-derive the non-perturbative
bosonization result for the single-particle Green func-
tion.
In the present context, the advantage is that it
can be combined with a Dyson-Schwinger equation in
the bosonic sector to derive a FRG ﬂow equation for
the fermionic self-energy from which we can extract the
renormalized velocity with a rather modest numerical ef-

2

fort. In contrast, if we work with a cutoﬀ in the fermionic
sector we have to solve more complicated coupled integro-
diﬀerential equations to obtain the renormalized veloc-
ity [25].

From the general hierarchy of FRG ﬂow equations [27],
we obtain the following exact ﬂow equation for the
fermionic self-energy in the momentum transfer cutoﬀ
scheme,

tiﬁed with the irreducible particle-hole bubble. Now in-

where the factor Ns = 2S + 1 = 2 is the spin degeneracy.
To obtain a closed system of equations, we need ad-
ditional equations of the three- and four-point vertices
appearing in Eqs. (4) and (5). Our truncation strategy
is based on the classiﬁcation of the vertices according to
their relevance at the quantum critical point describing
undoped graphene at vanishing temperature [25]. We
retain only the marginal part of all vertices which are ﬁ-
nite at the initial RG scale. This implies that we should

neglect the mixed four-point vertex Γss(cid:48)φφ
(which is irrelevant) and the sublattice changing three-
point vertices corresponding to the ﬁeld combinations

Moreover, the momentum- and frequency dependent part
of the three-point vertices is irrelevant so that it is suﬃ-
cient to retain only ΓAAφ

Static screening approximation.— Before presenting
the numerical solution of Eqs. (10) and (11), it is instruc-
tive to consider the corresponding RG ﬂow in the approx-
imation where the frequency dependence of the polariza-
tion is neglected. Approximating Π(i¯ω, q, ) ≈ Π(0, q) in
Eq. (9), we see that ZΛ = 1/γΛ = 1 and the ﬂow of
the dimensionless velocity ˜vl = vΛ/vF becomes ∂l˜vl =
b/(1 + c/˜vl) where we have deﬁned b = αI2(0) = α/4.
The solution of the above diﬀerential equation, with ini-
tial condition ˜v0 = 1, is given by (see the Supplemental
Material [33])

Keeping in mind that the coeﬃcient F0(α) can be nor-
malized to unity by redeﬁning the ultraviolet cutoﬀ, we
conclude that the above structure of the perturbation
series is equivalent with the series in Eq. (1) previously
derived by Barnes et al. [23]. In fact, our numerical value
1 = −πNs/16 ≈ −0.39
of the two-loop coeﬃcient f (2)
is reasonably close to the values given in the litera-
ture [13, 16, 21, 23]. This gives us conﬁdence that our
FRG approach indeed resumes the leading singularities.
Including dynamic screening.— We now present our
results obtained from the numerical solution of Eqs. (10)

which can be obtained from v(k) in Eq. (2) by substi-
tuting k → Λ. Anticipating that the cutoﬀ function
CΛ(α) vanishes logarithmically for Λ → 0, as seen in the
static screening approximation, we may identify B(α) =
liml→∞ ∂l˜vl = α liml→∞ [I2 (cZl/˜vl) − I1 (cZl/˜vl)]. But
we already know that Zl approaches a ﬁnite limit while
˜vl diverges for l → ∞, so within our truncation we
obtain B(α) = αI2(0) = α/4. The frequency de-
pendence of the polarization therefore does not modify
the form (12) of the cutoﬀ dependent velocity. From
the numerical solution ˜vl of the ﬂow equation (11), the
cutoﬀ function CΛ(α) in Eq. (17) can be obtained as
CΛ(α) = Λe4(˜vl−1)/α. On inserting the perturbative
one-loop result ˜vl − 1 = (α/4)l = (α/4) ln(Λ0/Λ), we
obtain CΛ(α) = Λ0. However, if we substitute for ˜vl
the solution of Eqs. (10) and (11) we ﬁnd that for any
ﬁnite α the function CΛ(α) vanishes for Λ → 0, as
shown in Fig. 4. For comparison, we also show the re-
sult (13) of the static screening approximation. In order
to quantify the modiﬁcations due to dynamic screening,
we present in the inset of Fig. 4 a double-logarithmic
plot of ln[CΛ/Λ0] versus ln l = ln ln(Λ0/Λ). From the
slope of the asymptotic straight line, for large ln l, we
see that CΛ/Λ0 ∼ c1/[ln(Λ0/Λ)]x with x ≈ 2.81 and c1
being a numerical constant of order unity. Note that in

In Fig. 2 we show the RG
ﬂow of ˜vl as function of the logarithmic ﬂow parameter
l = ln(Λ0/Λ) for the physically relevant value α = 2.2.
For comparison, we also show our analytical result (12)
in static screening approximation and the perturbative
one-loop RG result ˜vl = 1 + (α/4)l. The corresponding
RG ﬂow of the quasiparticle residue is shown in Fig. 3.
It is apparent that for l → ∞ the quasiparticle residue
approaches a ﬁnite constant Z∗ = liml→∞ Zl ≈ 0.4772
while the quasiparticle velocity diverges.

Summary and outlook.— With a strong motivation
to resolve the puzzle related to interaction eﬀects in
graphene, we have re-considered the problem of calculat-
ing the renormalized quasiparticle velocity for momenta
close to the Dirac points in undoped graphene. On com-
bining a FRG ﬂow equation for the fermionic self-energy
with a Dyson-Schwinger equation for the particle-hole
bubble and a Ward identity for the three-legged (Yukawa)
vertex, we have derived and solved a closed system of
RG ﬂow equations for the quasiparticle velocity and the
quasiparticle residue. In contrast to the fermionic cut-
oﬀ scheme [25], we have introduced a cutoﬀ only in the
bosonic Hubbard-Stratonovich ﬁeld which mediates the
interaction in the forward scattering channel. An impor-
tant advantage of this momentum transfer cutoﬀ scheme
is that, in the static limit, the ﬂow equation for the renor-
malized velocity can be solved exactly and the asymptotic
behavior of the velocity can be extracted analytically.

Our main result is that the cutoﬀ scale below which
the logarithmic singularity of the quasiparticle velocity
becomes apparent is itself logarithmically suppressed. In
static screening approximation, we expand our RG re-
sult in powers of the bare coupling α and reconcile with
the peculiar structure of the perturbative expansion of
v(k) in powers of α as found by Barnes et al. [23]. Al-
though the higher-order logarithmic corrections become
dominant only in the close vicinity of the Dirac points,
which probably cannot be resolved experimentally, it is
conceptually important to highlight the character of the
multi-logarithmic singularity of the renormalized veloc-
ity and thus unfolding the nature of interaction eﬀects in
graphene.

As an outlook, our approach might also be useful in
determining the critical interaction strength related to
chiral symmetry breaking in graphene [35]. Recently,
this problem was studied by Katanin [36] using a purely
fermionic FRG approach who found that vertex correc-
tions are crucially important to obtain an accurate esti-
mate of the critical interaction strength in graphene.

RG FLOW OF QUASIPARTICLE RESIDUE AND QUASIPARTICLE VELOCITY

In the following, we provide the details of the calculation concerning the ﬁnal RG ﬂow equations of the quasiparticle
residue, Eqs. (10) and quasiparticle velocity, Eq. (11). Our starting point is the expansion of the self-energy for small
frequencies and momenta, Eq. (8),

Σp(K) = (1 − Z−1

Λ )iω − (1 − Y −1

Λ )pvF σ · k + O(ω2, k2),

so that the fermionic propagator becomes

with renormalized quasiparticle velocity

Gp(K) = −ZΛ

iω + pvΛσ · k
ω2 + v2
Λk2

,

vΛ = ZΛY −1

Λ vF .

(S1)

(S2)

(S3)

From the above self-energy expression, it is clear that the RG ﬂow of ZΛ and YΛ can be expressed in terms of the
cutoﬀ-derivative of the self-energy as

with

Λ∂ΛZΛ = ηΛZΛ
Λ∂ΛYΛ = ˜ηΛYΛ,

The RG ﬂow of the renormalized velocity vΛ = ZΛY −1

ηΛ = ΛZΛ lim

Λ vF is therefore
Λ∂ΛvΛ = (ηΛ − ˜ηΛ)vΛ.

Now using the truncated FRG ﬂow equation, Eq. (6), with corresponding renormalized fermionic propagator and

STATIC SCREENING APPROXIMATION

In the following, we present details of the static screening approximation where the frequency dependence of the

dielectric function is neglected. In this approximation Z = 1 and the integral for ˜ηΛ in Eq. (S12) simpliﬁes,

The ﬂow of the dimensionless velocity ˜vl = vΛ/vF , in this approximation, is determined by

˜ηΛ =

e2

.

where we have deﬁned

∂l˜vl =

1 + c/˜vl

,

b = αI2(0) =

.

(S20)

(S21)

(S22)

The solution of the diﬀerential equation (S21) with initial condition ˜v0 = 1 is given by the solution of the implicit
equation

˜vl + c ln ˜vl = 1 + bl.

(S23)

As mentioned in the main text, the solution of this equation can be expressed in terms of the so-called Lambert
W-function [S1] W (x) (also called product logarithm),

(cid:18) e(1+bl)/c

(cid:19)

˜vl = cW

= cW

c

(cid:32)

.

(S24)

We use the fact that by deﬁnition the Lambert W-function W (x) is the solution of W eW = x and hence W (x) =
ln[x/W (x)]. Therefore, we may alternatively write the solution of the diﬀerential equation (S21) as



(cid:16) e(1+bl)/c

.

(S25)

We also use the fact that cW (e1/c/c) = 1 and immediately see that our solution indeed satisﬁes the initial condition
˜vl=0 = 1. We substitute l = ln(Λ0/Λ) and obtain for the cutoﬀ-dependent velocity,

.

Finally, in order to obtain the momentum-dependence of the quasiparticle velocity, we identify that v(k) = vΛ=k.
Recently, we have explicitly conﬁrmed the validity of this identiﬁcation using FRG [S2] which was based on the fact
that for Λ (cid:28) k the external momentum k acts as an infrared cutoﬀ. Therefore, we obtain B(α) = α/4 as the prefactor
of the logarithm in Eq. (2). We note that for large x the Lambert W-function can be approximated by

W (x) ≈ ln x − ln ln x +

ln ln x
ln x

.

We retain only the ﬁrst term of the large x asymptotic expansion and using c/b = πNs, we obtain for Λ → 0,

CΛ(α) ≈

(cid:2)1 − c ln c + α

Λ0

4 ln(Λ0/Λ)(cid:3)πNs

.

On substituting this approximation into Eq. (S26) and formally expanding the result for small α, we obtain

= F0(α) + F1(α) ln(Λ0/Λ) + F2(α) ln2(Λ0/Λ) + O(α4 ln3(Λ0/Λ)),

as given in Eq. (1) and setting now explicitly Ns = 2, we conclude that, within our truncation scheme, the ﬁrst two
coeﬃcients in the expansion of F1(α) are given by

while the coeﬃcient of the leading α3-term in the weak coupling expansion of F2(α) is

truncation, our result for the two-loop coeﬃcient f (2)
calculations [S3–S6]. Note that recently Barnes et al. [S6] found that the three-loop coeﬃcient f (3)

1 , which is conﬁrmed by our calculation.

Although the static screening approximation is not expected to give quantitatively accurate result, the fact that
the perturbative expansion of the renormalized velocity, Eq. (S26), in powers of α reproduces the known structure of
perturbation theory [S6] give us conﬁdence that our RG approach indeed resums the entire perturbation series in a
sensible way.
