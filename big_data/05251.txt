Abstract

Among the various explanations of the possible 750 GeV diphoton resonance,
the possibility of it being an sgoldstino is an attractive one, as it is related to
the spontaneous breaking of global supersymmetry. We discuss this possibil-
ity in this paper and point out the various theoretical issues associated with
it. In particular, we indicate the diﬃculties of this explanation in realistic
models of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking.

Introduction

The ATLAS and the CMS collaborations have recently reported some excess of events
in the diphoton invariant mass (mγγ) distribution based on 3.2 and 2.6 fb−1 of proton-
proton collision data respectively collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. ATLAS
observed the most signiﬁcant deviation from the background hypothesis at mγγ ≈ 750
GeV, corresponding to a local (global) signiﬁcance of 3.6 (2.0) 1 [1]. The largest excess in
the CMS data was seen around the 760 GeV mass bin with a local (global) signiﬁcance
of 2.6 ((cid:46) 1.2) standard deviations [2]. This excess is also found consistent with the
constraints from the run 1 data [3]. It was also reported by ATLAS that the properties
of the events in the signal region were found to be compatible with those in the invariant
mass regions above and below the excess. As suggested by many authors, the most
simple-minded explanation of this excess is to propose the existence of a resonance (S)
of mass ∼ 750 GeV. In order to generate the correct amount of signal, the resonance
must have couplings that produce σsignal ≡ σ(pp → S)Br(S → γ γ) about 5 fb [3–5].
In this article, we consider the possibility of this resonance being an sgoldstino2, the
“superpartner” of the goldstino, the goldstone fermion of spontaneous global supersym-
metry (SUSY) breaking. This possibility has been discussed by [7–11] using an eﬀective

1This was obtained using a narrow width of the signal component. The statistical signiﬁcance

increases slightly once the possibility of larger width is taken into account. See [1] for more details.

description of how the SUSY breaking is mediated to the MSSM sector. In this article,
we scrutinise the viability of this proposal when realistic models for the mediation of
SUSY breaking are considered. But before we start discussing that, we would like to
make a few general comments about SUSY breaking in order to put things in perspective.

Unlike other symmetries, there are some interesting limitations on the possibility of
spontaneous global SUSY breaking. For example, neither a pure super Yang-Mills (SYM)
nor a SYM theory with massive matter in real representations of the gauge group breaks
SUSY spontaneously3. In particular, global N = 2 SYM theories (that have matter in real
representations) cannot have SUSY spontaneously broken. This is one of the reasons
why one needs global N = 1 SUSY with complex representation for phenomenology
(i.e., MSSM) as there is a hope that SUSY can be spontaneously broken as required by
experiments.

However, even in MSSM, it turns out to be impossible to break SUSY spontaneously.
In fact, with the minimal ﬁeld content of MSSM both the SUSY and the EW symmetry
remains unbroken4. Hence, adding more ﬁelds to the MSSM is unavoidable. However,
even after adding many heavy ﬁelds, the gaugino masses cannot arise in a renormalisable
SUSY theory at tree-level. This is because SUSY does not contain any (gaugino)-
(gaugino)-(scalar) coupling that could give rise to a gaugino mass term when the scalar
gets a vacuum expectation value (VEV). Moreover, the tree level supertrace rules do
not allow a phenomenologically acceptable spectrum.

Hence, one possibility for breaking SUSY spontaneously in the MSSM is to have tree
level SUSY breaking in a so-called “hidden sector” and radiatively mediate the infor-
mation of SUSY breaking to the MSSM sector5. This also helps in ﬁnding a solution
of the SUSY ﬂavour problem. As the pattern of SUSY breaking interactions in the
visible MSSM sector is determined by the interactions of the messenger particles with
the MSSM, a natural way to avoid additional ﬂavour violation in the MSSM is to have
ﬂavour symmetries in the messenger interactions. The models of gauge mediation, where
the information of SUSY breaking is communicated to the MSSM sector by gauge in-
teractions, achieve this goal in a natural way6. In the gauge mediation scenarios, one
assumes the existence of “messenger ﬁelds” that are charged both under the SM gauge
group as well as the hidden sector quantum numbers. The mass scale of these messen-

3This follows from the fact that Witten Index of these theories is non-zero [12]. See also [13, 14].
4A Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term breaking also turns out to be phenomenologically unacceptable [15].
5Note that, in four space-time dimensions, if supersymmetry is not broken spontaneously at the tree

level, then it can not be broken by radiative Coleman-Weinberg mechanism [16]

6This is however not true in general, as the messenger ﬁelds can have renormalisable superpotential

couplings to the MSSM [17–22]

gers is arbitrary and, in principle, can be as low as ∼ 10 TeV. These models are often
called “low scale SUSY breaking” scenarios and, as we will see later, are the only ones
(among the diﬀerent SUSY breaking scenarios) relevant for the diphoton excess.

In the following section, we review the general framework that leads to the sgoldstino
explanation of the diphoton excess and present the necessary formulae to study the
phenomenology.
In section 3, we will discuss the ordinary gauge mediation (OGM)
scenario and point out the various theoretical issues it confronts in connection to the
diphoton excess. The generalisation of the OGM framework, called the extraordinary
gauge mediation (EOGM), will be discussed in section 4. In section 5, we will investigate
whether there is some way out of the diﬃculties raised in the previous sections. We will
conclude in section 6.

2 Generalities

2.1 Theoretical framework

In order to parameterise the eﬀect of SUSY breaking in the visible sector, it is usually
assumed that that SUSY is broken in the hidden sector by the VEV of the F component
of a chiral superﬁeld X. In particular, the gaugino masses are generated by the following
terms,

where the superscripts {1,2,3} refer to the U (1), SU (2) and SU (3) gauge groups respec-
tively (the adjoint indices for both the gauge groups SU (2) and SU (3) are denoted by
A), and α is the spinor index. The scale Mi denotes the mass scale of the messeger
ﬁelds which have been integrated out to get the above Lagrangian terms7. The chiral
superﬁeld X and Wα have the following expansion in terms of the ordinary ﬁelds,

X = S + √2θξ(y) + θθFx(y)

(φ(y) + ia(y)) + √2θξ(y) + θθFx(y)

7In models of gravity mediation, the scale Mi is of the order of the planck scale. It is then clear that

gravity mediation models are not relevant for the diphoton excess.

where, yµ = xµ − iθσµθ†.
Once the F term of X gets a VEV, say (cid:104)Fx(cid:105), the above Lagrangian terms generate the
following Majorana masses for the gauginos,

mi = ci (cid:104)Fx(cid:105)
Mi

.

(2.5)

The Lagrangian of Eq. (2.1) also generates couplings of the scalar components of X to
the gauge bosons,

Here sW and cW denote the sine and cosine of the Weinberg angle respectively. The par-

mφ by ma. There is slight diﬀerence between the decay rates of φ → ZZ(W +W −) and
a → ZZ(W +W −); however, that is numerically insigniﬁcant (see appendix A).

total width of S is denoted by ΓS. The numerical values of the quantities Aii

calculated in appendix B and are given by,

(2.17)

In order to explain the signal, σ13 TeV must be approximately in the range 3−8 fb, assum-
ing that the resonance has a small width (cid:46) few GeV [3]. A larger width of ∼ 40 GeV
requires σ13 TeV to be slightly higher: σ13 TeV ≈ 5 − 14 fb [3]. As the sgoldstino typically
has a narrow width, in our estimates we will use the range 3− 8 fb for the required cross
section.

We will ﬁrst consider the production by gluon fusion only, as the production by u¯u and
d ¯d initial states is slightly disfavoured [3–5].
In section 5.3, we will comment on the
possibility of quark initiated production.

9Here we use the approximation that ΓS /mS is small. This is a very good approximation even for

the case when Γ = 45 GeV, which gives ΓS /mS = 0.06.

3 Ordinary gauge mediation

In the OGM framework, the hidden sector is parameterised by a single chiral superﬁeld
X. Both the scalar and auxiliary components of X are assumed to get VEVs that
are denoted by (cid:104)S(cid:105) and (cid:104)Fx(cid:105) respectively. In addition to this, OGM also includes N5
vector like pairs of messenger ﬁelds, (Φi, ˜Φi), transforming under 5 + ¯5 of SU (5)10. The
corresponding superpotential reads,

WOGM = λijX ˜ΦiΦj ,

(3.1)

where the indices {i, j} run from 1 to N5. Note that the matrix λij can always be
brought to a diagonal form with real entries by independent unitary rotations on Φ and
˜Φ (the K¨ahler potential remain unchanged). Hence, in the rest of this section, we will
assume that λi,j is diagonal with λii ≡ λi.
The fermions of each {Φi, ˜Φi} pair has a Dirac mass mi
of the complex scalars, on the other hand, have squared masses m2± = λ2
The gaugino masses are generated at the one loop level and are given by [26],

F = λi(cid:104)S(cid:105). The mass eigenstates
i(cid:104)S(cid:105)2 ± λi(cid:104)Fx(cid:105).

(3.3)

The symbol di denotes twice the Dynkin index for a particular representation. For
example, in the case of 5 + ¯5 of SU (5), d = 1.
In Eq. 3.2, we have used the GUT
normalisation of the hypercharge gauge coupling.

Note that the SUSY breaking F -term VEV (cid:104)Fx(cid:105) must satisfy (cid:104)Fx(cid:105) ≤ λi(cid:104)S(cid:105)2 ,∀i in order
to avoid the messenger scalar masses from becoming tachyonic. For simplicity, we assume
all the λi couplings to be equal and set them to a common value λ. We deﬁne the ratio
λ(cid:104)Fx(cid:105)/m2
F to be κ. With these deﬁnitions, the formula for the gaugino mass takes the
form (for messengers in 5 + ¯5 of SU (5)),

10Complete representations of a GUT group are normally used in order to keep the uniﬁcation of
the gauge couplings intact. However, in general, complete representations are not necessary. The use
of incomplete representations often also have interesting phenomenology, see for example, [25] and the
references therein.

We now examine the requirements on mF , (cid:104)Fx(cid:105) and N5 in order to generate the correct
cross section for the excess.
In order to have a feeling for the messenger mass scale
required for the excess, we ﬁrst consider a single pair of SU (5) messengers {5 + 5}
i.e., N5 = 1 and also set λ = 1. Following the discussion of the previous section, the
explanation of the diphoton excess requires11,

The messenger scale can be raised if the number of messenger ﬁelds is increased.
Fig. 1 we show the allowed region in the mF – N5 plane for λ = 1 and κ = 0.8. In the

11Here we have neglected any decay mode other than the gauge boson ﬁnal states. However, existence
of other decay modes will increase the total width of the resonance, hence adding an extra contribution
to the denominator of Eq. 3.10. This means that the required signal cross section will be even higher,
as pointed out also in the end of section 2.2. Thus our estimate is on the conservative side.

contribution from only φ is considered, the right panel takes into account both φ and a
contributions.

left panel, only the contribution of φ to the signal is considered, while in the upper right
panel contributions from both φ and a are taken into account. As discussed before, κ
should satisfy κ ≤ 1 to avoid tachyonic states in the messenger sector. For κ very close to
unity, one of the complex scalars in every pair of messenger ﬁelds becomes too light (its
F (1 − κ)). Also, the function f (κ) decreases rapidly for κ (cid:38) 0.8 [26]
squared mass is m2
reducing the MSSM squark masses. Hence, we have chosen a value κ = 0.8 in Fig. 1.

The light green shaded region reproduces the correct amount of signal to explain the
excess. In the light red shaded region, the gaugino masses are what is required by the
exclusion limits of the LHC. In particular, the gluino mass is set to more than 1.5 TeV
and a conservative lower bound of 200 GeV is considered for the bino and wino masses.
Similarly, in the light blue region the squarks are heavier than a TeV. It can be seen
that a very large number of messengers (cid:38) 60 is required in order to both successfully
explain the signal as well as produce suﬃciently large gaugino and squark masses.

However, for such a large number of messenger ﬁelds, the gauge couplings lose asymptotic
freedom. The one-loop running of the gauge couplings above the messenger fermion mass
mF is shown in Fig. 2 for two sets of values of {mF , N5}, shown as black dots in Fig. 1.
The point {mF , N5} = {14 TeV, 65} is chosen such that all the requirements namely,
correct amount of the signal cross section and heavy enough gaugino and squark masses

where the squark masses are generated at the tree level [29, 30]. However, even in this
case, the required number of messenger pairs is (cid:38) 35 and the one-loop Landau pole is
encountered below ∼ 80 TeV.
Before concluding this section, we would like to make two ﬁnal comments:
i)Although we have presented our results for messengers transforming under {5 + 5} of
SU (5), our general conclusions hold for other representations also and even in the case
when the possibility of doublet-triplet splitting is considered (this will be more clear in
section 5.3).
ii)The formula in Eq. 3.5 is strictly valid only if the SUSY breaking VEV is small
namely, κ << 1. For κ ∼ 1, one has to compute the separate loop contributions from
the messenger scalar with masses m2± = m2
F (1 ± κ). This gives a correction factor
∼
in the decay rates for the scalar φ ( here we have assumed λ = 1 for
simplicity). This factor is only ≈ 2.5 for κ = 0.8 which we use for our analysis12 and is
12The paper [31] which appeared after the ﬁrst version of our paper considered the very ﬁne tuned
possibility of κ being extremely close to unity which may somewhat mitigate the problem, however, in

3.1 Possibility of larger λ

It can be seen from Eq. 3.5 that, for a given gaugino mass, the ci coeﬃcients (hence,
diphoton signal cross section) can be increased by increasing λ. However, one should
ﬁrst check the RG running of λ in order to see the maximum value of λ that is safe.

As the fundamental representation of SU (5) can be decomposed into representations of
SU (3) ⊗ SU (2) ⊗ U (1) in the following way,

the superpotential can be rewritten as,

In Fig. 3 we show the running of these λ couplings for ﬁve pairs of {5 + ¯5} messengers
and for two initial values of λ at the scale 10 TeV, λ(10 TeV) = 1 and 2. It can be seen
from the right panel of Fig. 3 that even for λ(10 TeV) = 2, it grows very fast and hits
a one-loop Landau-pole below ∼ 25 TeV. Needless to say, the situation gets worse if a
larger number of messenger pairs is considered. Hence, we conclude from this analysis
that values of λ much larger than unity at the messenger scale is not a possibility.

3.2 Estimate of the mass of S

It was shown in [32] that in renormalizable Wess-Zumino models with canonical K¨ahler
potential, the existence of a massless fermion implies that the complex scalar in the
same chiral multiplet remains massless at the tree level even if SUSY is spontaneously
broken. As the fermion component of X is the goldstino in our case (which is exactly
massless even at loop level), the scalar component of X, the sgoldstino will be massless
at the tree level. However, in general, the sgoldstino is expected to acquire non-zero
mass when loop corrections are included.

12

In our scenario, the sgoldstino mass gets contribution from the loops of messenger ﬁelds
(apart from possible contributions from the hidden sector). The messenger contribution
is computed in appendix C. The ﬁnal result is given by (for N5 pairs of 5 + ¯5 of SU (5)),

(3.21)

Hence, the potential for the sgoldstino gets a one-loop negative quadratic contribution
from the messenger ﬁelds and this contribution is considerably larger in magnitude than
the squared gluino mass13. This means that a large contribution from the hidden sector
is required to stabilise the sgoldstino potential and somehow generate a small mass
∼ 750 GeV for the sgoldstino.
At this point, we would like to remind the readers that, in our discussions till now, we
have completely ignored specifying the details of the hidden sector and how SUSY is
broken there. We just assumed that the chiral superﬁeld X gets a SUSY breaking F -
term VEV from the dynamics of the hidden sector without specifying the hidden sector
at all. However, in order to understand whether a light sgoldstino can be obtained
without too much tuning, we are now forced to consider the hidden sector as part of our
model and think about the problem in entirety. We postpone any further investigation
of this issue to section 5.

4 Extra Ordinary Gauge Mediation

We have seen in the previous section that the OGM framework needs a very large number
of messengers in order to explain the diphoton signal and avoid the strong constraints
on the gluino and squark masses from LHC. We have also seen that such a large number
of messengers renders the theory non-perturbative at scales as low as ∼ 50 TeV, much
below the GUT scale.

In this section we will consider a generalisation of the OGM framework namely, the
Extra Ordinary Gauge Mediation (EOGM) where the OGM Lagrangian (Eq. 3.1) is
supplemented with vector-like mass terms for the chiral superﬁels ˜Φi and Φj [34]. Hence,
we now have the EOGM superpotential

WEOGM = (λijX + mij) ˜ΦiΦj ,

(4.1)

13Note that, models with non-polynomial superpotential can give rise to tree level sgoldstino mass.
We compute the sgoldstino mass in one such model [33] in appendix C.3, however, again it turns out
to be in general much larger than the gluino mass.

13

where, λij and mij are arbitrary complex matrices. As in the OGM scenario, the aux-
iliary ﬁeld of X is assumed to get a VEV to break SUSY spontaneously. The fermion
components of the messenger ﬁelds have the Dirac mass matrix,

mF = λij(cid:104)S(cid:105) + mij .

(4.2)

Without loss of generality, one can always go to the basis of ˜Φ and Φ (by independent
unitary rotations on them that do not aﬀect their K¨ahler potential) where mF is diagonal
with real eigenvalues (mF )i. Hence, from now on we will assume that the matrix mF
is diagonal and the matrices λij and mij are deﬁned in the basis where mF is diagonal.
The scaler mass-squared matrix in this basis can now be written as,

(cid:32)

(cid:33)

˜m2 =

2 −λ(cid:104)Fx(cid:105)

mF
−λ(cid:104)Fx(cid:105) mF

.

(4.3)

We will assume the matrix λ to be real and symmetric in order to impose invariance
under CP and messenger parity (i.e., Φi → ˜Φi in the basis where mF is diagonal) in the
messenger sector [35, 36].

The matrix ˜m2 can be block diagonalised by a suitable change of basis of the scalar
ﬁelds, the block diagonalised matrix being,

(4.8)

Hence, for ﬁxed values of the messenger fermion masses, the situation is exactly the same
as OGM. In the presence of many pair of messengers, if [mF , λ] = 0 then the matrix λ
can be diagonalised simultaneously with mF and hence, the situation is again exactly
the same as OGM with many messenger ﬁelds. In the case when [mF , λ] (cid:54)= 0, in general,
one has to analyse the situation numerically. Analytic results are known even in this
case for λ(cid:104)Fx(cid:105) << m2

(4.10)

As neﬀ is less than the total number of messengers, the gaugino mass in this case
is always less than that in the OGM case.

• R(X) = 0, even in this case the expression of the gaugino mass simpliﬁes to,

5 Way out?

We have seen in the previous sections that an sgoldstino explanation of the diphoton
excess faces two major issues: i) the gaugino masses, and in particular the gluino mass,
turn out to be rather low unless a very large number of messenger ﬁelds is considered;
ii) the messenger particles yield a large negative one loop contribution to the sgoldstino
potential. In this section, our goal is to look for potential solutions of the above problems.

15

Figure 4: Diagram showing that a D-term does not contribute to the the Majorana gaugino
mass at the leading order in the F -term VEV.

5.1 D-term contribution to the gaugino mass

We have only considered F -term contribution to the gaugino mass in the previous sec-
tions. We will now assume that the messenger ﬁelds are also charged under some new
U (1) gauge group. The Φ ﬁelds have charge +1 and the ˜Φ ﬁelds carry a charge −1 under
this new U (1). The relevant part of the Lagrangian is given by,

(cid:90)

The F -term of the chiral superﬁeld X and the D-term of the vector superﬁeld V are as-
sumed to have VEVs (cid:104)Fx(cid:105) and (cid:104)D(cid:105) respectively14. However, since the above Lagrangian
possesses an U (1) R-symmetry, the charges being R(Φ) = 1, R( ˜Φ) = 1, R(X) = 0 and
R(V ) = 0, it follows that the F -term and the D-term have the R-charges R(F ) = 2 and
R(D) = 0. Hence, (cid:104)Fx(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0 breaks R-symmetry spontaneously, while (cid:104)D(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0 does not.
It is then clear that the gaugino masses must be associated with non-zero (cid:104)Fx(cid:105).
As we discussed previously, the leading F -term contribution to the gaugino mass comes
from the term

(5.2)

As the gaugino mass is always associated with (cid:104)Fx(cid:105), the D-term contribution must
always be suppressed by higher powers of Λ and hence, subdominant compared to the
leading F -term contribution. That there is no D-term contribution at the leading order
in the F -term VEV can also be understood diagrammatically. It can be seen from Fig. 4
that, in order to join the scalar lines, one needs a term φ1φ2 in the Lagrangian (refer to
appendix C for the notation) which does not arise from the D-term.

14Note that the existence of non-zero (cid:104)D(cid:105) breaks the messenger parity spontaneously.

sector and corresponds to either an abelian or a non-abelian gauge group. Note that,
as mentioned before, the term in (5.3) breaks R-symmetry explicitly. We thus conclude
that D-term contribution can not enhance the gaugino mass considerably.

We would like to comment in passing on the problem of vanishing leading order (in SUSY
breaking F term VEV) gaugino masses in models of direct gauge mediation [39, 40] and
semi-direct gauge mediation [41], regardless of how the R-symmetry is broken. The
authors of [32] proved this in generalised renormalizable O’Raifeartaigh models assuming
a locally stable pseudomoduli space. This problem can be avoided with non-polynomial
superpotential which naturally appears in many models of dynamical/non-perturbative
SUSY breaking (DSB) [42–44]. Hence, the gaugino mass to leading order in (cid:104)Fx(cid:105) that
were considered in the previous sections should indeed be thought in the framework of
DSB models.

5.2 Metastable SUSY breaking

Before going to the discussion of metastable SUSY breaking, it is worth reviewing brieﬂy
the relation between R-symmetry and spontaneous SUSY breaking.

Consider a generic model of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking in which a Hidden
sector (HS) consisting of the superﬁelds (Ya, X) breaks supersymmetry and then mes-
senger ﬁelds (Φi, ˜Φi) communicate the supersymmetry breaking to the visible MSSM
sector via loop eﬀects. The hidden sector ﬁelds are neutral under the Standard Model
gauge group but could have its own gauge dynamics while the messenger ﬁelds (Φi, ˜Φi)
transform in a vector like representation of SM gauge group and could also be charged
under the HS gauge group.

Let us write the full superpotential of the theory as follows

W = WHS({Ya}, X) + WM(X, Φi, ˜Φi) + WMSSM,

with WM = λijXΦi ˜Φj + mijΦi ˜Φj .

(5.5)

17

Here WMSSM is the MSSM superpotential and WHS is hidden sector superpotential which
spontaneously breaks SUSY15.

What can one say about the R-symmetry in WHS? Note that, for generic superpotential
without R-symmetry, Nelson and Seiberg showed that supersymmetric vacuum always
exists [45].
In other words, R-symmetry is a necessary (but not suﬃcient) condition
for spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry. However, unbroken R-symmetry forbids
(Majorana) masses for the gauginos. Thus, it must be broken spontaneously which, in
turn, would lead to a massless R-axion that may be dangerous for phenomenology16.

Another possibility is to break R-symmetry explicitly in hidden sector (WHS). Now it is
possible to write down models with no R-symmetry which break SUSY spontaneously
but these models have a non-generic superpotential in the sense that it doesn’t allow
all renormalisable terms allowed by symmetries. As superpotential couplings are pro-
tected from renormalisation and hence are not generated at loop levels, a non generic
superpotential is technically natural. However, it is tuned and not satisfactory.

One scenario which avoids these problems is metastable supersymmetry breaking [47].
It is based on the idea that though the true vacuum is supersymmetric, our universe lies
in a metastable vacuum. In this picture, there is no need to keep R-symmetry but one
does need to worry about decay rates from the metastable vacuum to the true vacuum
and arrange for a long lived universe.

As mentioned in the previous section, the problem of vanishing leading order (in SUSY
breaking F -term) gaugino masses can be avoided in models of DSB. Hence, DSB in a
metastable vacuum is an attractive phenomenological possibility. In fact, some of these
models can potentially solve the problem mentioned in section 3.2 and give rise to a
light sgoldstino [48–50]. However, detailed exploration of these models are necessary to
see whether they can indeed serve as natural models for a light sgoldstino and avoids
the problems mentioned in section 3.

5.3 Quark anti-quark initiated production of the sgoldstino

In this section, we consider the possibility that the production cross section of sgoldstino
has a signiﬁcant contribution from quark anti-quark initial state. The coupling of the
sgoldstino to the quark anti-quark pair can arise from the same eﬀective Lagrangian

15Note that the R-parity conserving MSSM has three parameter worth of R-symmetries. However,

R-symmetry has gauge anomalies in the MSSM.

16R-symmetry may be broken by Gravity eﬀects, thus giving mass to the R-axion [46]

We now assume that the production of sgoldstino is mostly by the ¯uu and ¯dd initial states
so that a large coupling to gluons is not necessary. We deﬁne the number of messengers
with quantum numbers (1, 2)1/2 to be N12. Their mass will be denoted by mweak

Similarly, in the right panel the allowed region in
the N12 – Au/Ad plane is shown for mweak
F = 8 TeV. It can be seen that even for very
large value of Au = Ad ∼ 10 TeV 18, quite low masses for the electroweak messenger
(cid:46) 10 TeV with a very large multiplicity (cid:38) 50 is necessary. Consequently,
ﬁelds mweak
the SU (2) and U (1) couplings (i.e., g2
i /4π) hit Landau poles typically below few hundred
TeV. For example, for mweak
= 8 TeV and N12 = 100, the one loop Landau poles for
SU (2) and U (1) appear around 50 GeV and 200 GeV respectively.

As the SUSY breaking F -term VEV (cid:104)Fx(cid:105) must be less (mweak
in the messenger sector, it also turns out that a gluino mass of more than 1.5 TeV again
requires a very large number of SU (3) messengers, exactly as the OGM scenario discussed
earlier.

However, one could consider a scenario where the X superﬁelds that couple to the SU (3)
messengers (denoted by Φ3 and ˜Φ3 below) are diﬀerent from the X superﬁelds that couple
to the SU (2) messengers (denoted by Φ2 and ˜Φ2 below) so that,

W = (X2 + m2) ˜Φ2Φ2 + (X3 + m3) ˜Φ3Φ3 ,

The X2 and X3 superﬁelds get VEVs given by,

(cid:104)X2(cid:105) = (cid:104)S2(cid:105) + θθ(cid:104)F2(cid:105) ,
(cid:104)X3(cid:105) = (cid:104)S3(cid:105) + θθ(cid:104)F3(cid:105) .

In the limit of F3 (cid:29) F2, Sh ≈ S3 and Sl ≈ S2.
If we now assume that the scalar
Sl is actually the 750 GeV resonance and the other scalar Sh is much heavier then the
diphoton signal can be explained. Moreover, as F3 is now assumed to be much large
than F2, large gluino mass can also be easily obtained.

17In general, A-terms are generated at 1-loop level in the models of messenger matter interactions.
Thus they are of same order of the gaugino masses. Larger A-terms can be obtained from model where
A-terms are generated at the tree level [51]. These models have the advantage of being free from A/m2
problem [20].

18Note that very large A-terms may give rise to electric charge and SU (3) colour breaking minima in

the potential [52, 53], thus we restrict them to 10 TeV in our analysis.

20

Figure 6: Allowed region in the case of quark anti-quark initiated production of the sgoldstino
with only light hypercharge messengers.

However, it should be mentioned that the scalar Sl is actually not the sgoldstino. It is
actually Sh which appears in the goldstino multiplet, hence, Sh should be identiﬁed as
the sgoldstino. In this sense, we have not solved the original problem with sgoldstino
being the candidate for the 750 GeV resonance.

Before concluding this section, we would also like to point out that one can also consider
the extreme case when there are three diﬀerent superﬁelds X1, X2 and X3 that couple
to the U (1), SU (2) and SU (3) messengers respectively. In this case, both the SU (2)
and SU (3) messenger masses can be very high. In Fig. 6 we show the number of U (1)
messengers (N1) and their mass (mY
F ) required for the correct amount of signal and
also mass of Bino more than 200 GeV. It can be seen that for mY
F ∼ 5 TeV one needs
N1 (cid:38) 50. The landau pole in the U (1) gauge coupling only appears around 2000 TeV in
this case.

6 Conclusion

In this paper we have carefully studied the possibility of an sgoldstino being a candidate
for the signal of a possible new resonance with mass ∼ 750 GeV recently reported by the
ATLAS and CMS collaborations. We have found that the explanation of the signal is in
tension with the lower bound on masses from direct searches of gauginos, in particular,
In order to achieve a large enough gluino mass, a very large number of
the gluino.

rather low scale of order few tens of TeV. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the one-loop messenger
contribution to the sgoldstino potential is negative and large in magnitude (larger than
the gluino mass squared). Hence, a large positive contribution from the hidden sector is
required to tune this away and get a small mass ∼ 750 GeV for the sgoldstino.
While there exist examples of models with dynamically broken SUSY where a light
sgoldstino can, in principle, be achieved, perhaps without large tuning, getting both the
correct amount of signal cross-section and also large enough gluino and squark masses
(without spoiling the calculability of the theory at a rather low scale) seems to be a
stubborn problem. It would be interesting to ﬁnd explicit models where these problems
can be overcome in a satisfactory way. We postpone investigation in this direction to
future studies.

We have also considered the possibility of the resonance being produced by quark anti-
quark initial state. While in this case the problem of Landau poles can be delayed
beyond few thousand TeV, the scalar resonance can not be the sgoldstino.

A Calculation of the partial decay widths

In this appendix we will calculate the partial decay rate of φ and a to two vector bosons.

B.2 Production by quarks

The cross section of the process ¯q q → φ can be calculated in the same way as above,
except for the following changes,

• The colour factor is diﬀerent, so we must have 1/32 instead of 1/82 as in the case

for gluons

• The symmetry factor (1/2) for identical particle used in Eq. (B.11) no longer

applies

• The PDF are diﬀerent - we now have quark PDF instead of the gluon PDF.

couplings for the groups SU(2) and SU(3) respectively. Thus, F -term contribution to
the scalar potential is subdominant compared to the D-term contribution. The minimum
