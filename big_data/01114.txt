Abstract

The fragmentation of quasi-projectiles from the nuclear reaction 40Ca+12C
at 25 MeV per nucleon bombarding energy was used to produce α-emission
sources. From a careful selection of these sources provided by a complete
detection and from comparisons with models of sequential and simultaneous
decays, evidence in favor of α-particle clustering from excited 16O, 20N e and
24M g is reported.

alpha-conjugate nuclei
Cluster models

Clustering is a generic phenomenon which can appear in homogeneous
matter when density decreases; the formation of galaxies as well as the disin-
tegration of hot dilute heavy nuclei into lighter nuclei are extreme examples
occurring in nature. As far as nuclear physics is concerned, the nucleus
viewed as a collection of α-particles was discussed very early [1] and in the
last forty years both theoretical and experimental eﬀorts were devoted to
the study of clustering phenomena in nuclei [2, 3, 4]. It was recently shown
clear deviations from statistical models in the decay pattern of excited 24M g
nuclei: measured emission channels involving multiple α-particles are 20 to
40% more probable than expected [5, 6, 7]. It is also known that low den-
sity nuclear matter is predicted to be unstable against cluster formation,
mainly α-particles [8, 9], and that excited states of alpha-conjugate nuclei
like 12C and 16O are well described assuming a weakly interacting gas of
almost free α-particles, which can be qualiﬁed as an α-particle condensate
state [10, 11]. Very recently the formation of α-particle clustering from ex-
cited expanding alpha-conjugate nuclei was revealed in two diﬀerent con-
strained self-consistent mean ﬁeld calculations [12, 13].

The aim of the present Letter is to search for experimental evidence of α-
particle clustering from excited and consequently expanding alpha-conjugate
nuclei. The chosen experimental strategy was to use the reaction 40Ca+12C
at an incident energy (25 MeV per nucleon) high enough to possibly produce
some hot expanding reaction products, associated with a high granularity,
high solid angle particle array (to precisely reconstruct directions of velocity
vectors). Then, by selecting the appropriate reaction mechanism and speciﬁc
events, the required information was inferred.

The experiment was performed at INFN, Laboratori Nazionali del Sud in
Catania, Italy. The beam, impinging on a thin carbon target (320 µg/cm2),
was delivered by the Superconducting Cyclotron and the charged reaction
products were detected by the CHIMERA 4π multi-detector [14]. The beam
intensity was kept around 107 ions/s to avoid pile-up events. Events were
registered when the silicon detectors of at least three telescopes were ﬁred.
CHIMERA consists of 1192 telescopes made of ∆E silicon detectors 200-
300 µm thick (depending on polar angle) and CsI(Tl) stopping detectors.
They are mounted on 35 rings covering 94% of the solid angle, with polar
angle ranging from 1◦ to 176◦. The solid angle corresponding to each module

2

varies between 0.13 msr at forward angles and 35.4 msr at the most backward
angles. Among the most interesting characteristics of CHIMERA are the low
detection and identiﬁcation thresholds for light charged particles (LCPs) and
the very high granularity at forward angles. Mass A and charge number Z
of detected reaction products were determined by the energy vs time-of-
ﬂight method (TOF) for LCPs stopped in silicon detectors and by ∆E − E
(Z > 5) and shape identiﬁcation (Z ≤ 5) techniques for charged products
stopped in CsI(Tl). In addition, part of emitted 8Be nuclei (two equal-energy
α’s hitting the same crystal) were identiﬁed in CsI(Tl) [15]. Silicon detectors
were calibrated using proton, carbon and oxygen beams at various energies
ranging from 10 to 100 MeV and energy measured with a resolution better
than 1%. As α-particles of interest lose the major part of their energy in
CsI(Tl) crystals, a dedicated energy calibration of their fast component light
was realized using the TOF information and more than 95% of modules
from 1◦ to 62◦ were calibrated. The energy resolution for alpha particles
varies between 1.0 and 2.5% depending on the module. Further details on A
and Z identiﬁcations and on the quality of energy calibrations can be found
in Refs. [16, 17, 18].
In the present work, all reaction products hitting a
detection module were considered as emitted in direction of the geometrical
center of that module (see [18] for this choice). When results of simulations
were ﬁltered by the multi-detector replica, the same prescription was applied.

As a ﬁrst step in our event selection procedure, we want to exclude from
the data sample poorly-measured events. Without making any hypothesis
about the physics of the studied reaction one can measure (see Fig. 1 (left))
the total detected charge Ztot (neutrons are not measured) and the total
pseudo linear momentum normalized to the projectile momentum Ptot/Pproj
(see Eq.1)

(cid:88)

Ptot =

βparγZ.

(1)

βpar is the reduced velocity component, with respect to the beam direction, of
the reaction product of atomic number Z and γ is the Lorentz factor. As the
grazing angle of the reaction is 1.11◦, to suppress elastic and quasi-elastic
reactions, the ﬁrst internal ring (1.0◦-1.8◦ polar angle) of CHIMERA was
removed to obtain the data in Fig. 1 (left). Well measured events clearly ap-
pear in the upper right part of the ﬁgure. In relation with their cross-sections
and with the geometrical eﬃciency of CHIMERA, the well detected reaction
mechanisms correspond to projectile fragmentation (PF) [19, 20, 21] with

Figure 1: (Color online) Left: contour plot showing event-by-event correlations between
the total detected charge Ztot and the normalized pseudo linear momentum (see text).
Right: distribution of α-particle multiplicity, Mα, for well detected events (Ztot ≥19).

Ztot=19-20 (target fragmentation not detected) and to incomplete/complete
fusion [22] with Ztot=21-26. At this stage we can have a ﬁrst indication of the
multiplicity of α-particles, Mα, emitted per event for well identiﬁed mech-
anisms (Ztot ≥19 - see Fig. 1 (right)). Mα extends up to thirteen, which
means a deexcitation of the total system into α-particles only. Moreover a
reasonable number of events exhibit Mα values up to about 6-7.

The goal is now to tentatively isolate, in events, reaction products emit-
ting α-particles only. Ref. [19] has shown that, at an incident energy close
to ours, 20N e PF is dominated by alpha-conjugate reaction products. Based
on this, and expecting the same for 40Ca PF, we restrict our selection to
completely detected (Ztot=20) PF events composed of one projectile frag-
ment and α-particles. Charge conservation imposes Zf rag = 20 - 2Mα. Fig.
2 shows an example of the mass number distribution, Af rag, for Zf rag=8 as-
sociated to Mα=6. As expected Af rag=16 largely dominates; only about 8%
of events correspond to neutron transfers between projectile and target and
lead to an Af rag which is diﬀerent from sixteen.

After this double selection, the question is: from which emission source
are the α-particles emitted? Several possible candidates are present and fur-
ther selections must be done before restricting our study to alpha-sources

emitting exclusively the Mα observed (called N α sources in what follows).
Possibilities that we shall examine concern: i) pre-equilibrium (PE) α-particle
emission, ii) PF deexcitation through α-particle emission proceeding via un-
bound states and iii) evaporation from excited Ca projectiles having emitted
α-particles only. Concerning deexcitation of PF events via unbound states,
we want, for instance, to exclude from the selection an event composed of
two fragments (24M g and 12C*) and one α-particle ﬁnally producing one
fragment (24M g) and four α-particles.

Considering the incident energy of the reaction and the forward focusing
of reaction products, it is important to identify the possible presence of pre-
equilibrium (PE) α-particles [23, 24, 25] in our selected PF events. With the
hypothesis that all α-particles are emitted from their center-of-mass reference
frame, we can examine the corresponding α-particle spectra. Fig. 3 shows
one example of such spectra for Mα=5.
It exhibits a distribution which
resembles a thermal one with the presence of a high energy tail, which signs
PE emission; a similar spectrum, in the center-of-mass of the reaction, is
obtained at forward angles for the involved collisions. To prevent errors on
alpha emitter properties it is necessary to remove events in which such PE

emission can be present. The curve superimposed on the spectrum in Fig.
3 corresponds to a thermal Maxwellian ﬁt (Coulomb correction, Cc, of 0.22
MeV and temperature, T , of 6.5 MeV) with a volume pre-exponential factor:
dN/dE ∝ (E − Cc)1/2exp[−(E − Cc)/T ] [26]. It was used to impose an upper
energy limit of 40 MeV, found irrespective of Mα, for α-particles. Table 1

to suppress events. Correlation function is deﬁned as the ratio between the
correlated (physical) yield, Ycorr, and the product of single particle yields,
generically termed as uncorrelated spectrum, Yuncorr, measured under the
same conditions,

.

(2)

The correlated yield spectrum Ycorr is constructed with the required number
of α-particles detected in the same event and we choose to build Yuncorr by
mixing particles from diﬀerent events [28]. If no correlations are present MCF
should be unity. The generic variable X is the total kinetic energy of the par-
ticles of interest in their center-of-mass frame, Etot, or the excitation energy
of their emitting source/state, Eex = Etot + Q; Q is the mass balance. As an
example, for events with Mα=6 we build three-, four- and ﬁve-particle MCFs
considering all possible combinations of α-particles. Fig. 4 displays the four-
particle MCF. Peaks, statistically signiﬁcant, are located in the excitation
energy range 16.7 - 22.0 MeV. Considering the experimental resolution mea-
sured, around 350 keV [18], the following peaks or sum of two peaks which
correspond to unbound states of 16O are observed: 16.84 + 17.20, 17.72 +
18.09, 19.26 + 19.54, 20.05 + 20.41, 21.05 and 21.65 MeV; some of them
16.84 and 21.05 being known as 100% α-particle emitters. This is a clear

studies it appears that only two nuclei, 12C (Hoyle state and broad peak
centered at 9.64 MeV excitation energy) and 16O (see Fig. 4) signiﬁcantly
contribute to deexcitation via their unbound states. For each Mα value, av-
erage MCF values corresponding to each state have been calculated and only
a percentage of events (from 1 to 95 %) with α-particles populating those
states were kept. Percentages kept correspond to the weights (in percent) of
background levels under the peaks: 1 - [(MCF-1)/MCF] = 1/MCF. Table 1
shows the small percentages of suppressed events (from 1.6 to 3.9 %), which
obviously concern events with low energy α-particles in their α reference
frame. Final numbers of selected events for each of the Mα values are also
indicated, which show suﬃcient statistics for comparisons with simulations
for Mα=4-6.

As far as N α sources are concerned, the eﬀect of suppressing events is to
reduce both the mean values and the widths of their excitation energy dis-
tributions. As an example, for N α=4, mean excitation decreases from 56.2
to 52.4 MeV and the root mean square (RMS) of the distribution from 22.7
to 15.7 MeV. The corresponding α-energy spectrum (top, black dots) is dis-
played in Fig. 5; for comparison same information is also reported for N α=6
(bottom, black dots). For deduced excitation energies we did not consider
deexcitations via 8Be because they do not signiﬁcantly modify the conclu-
sions. However, for completeness, Table 2 shows the percentages of one and
two 8Be emissions measured from relative energy spectra of two α-particles
and associated correlation functions for diﬀerent Mα values; percentages with
three 8Be are found negligible (< 1%). Information relative to 8Be emission
will be important to discuss sequential versus simultaneous α-emission from
N α sources.

To conclude on this part, one can indicate that if excited N α sources have
been formed their excitation energy thresholds for total deexcitation into α-
particles vary from 20 to 50 MeV as N α varies from 4 to 6. Their mean
excitation energy per nucleon is rather constant around 3.3-3.5 MeV. One
can also deduce a crude estimation of the average lowest density they may
have reached due to thermal pressure before decaying into α-particles. To do
that, starting from a phenomenological quadratic equation of state (EoS) [29],
an EoS for subnormal density of ﬁnite nuclear systems was proposed in [30]:

(E/A)T =0 = 8[(1 − ρ/ρ0)2 − 1]M eV.

Before discussing diﬀerent possible deexcitations involved for ﬁnal re-
tained events, information on projectile fragmentation mechanism is needed.
Global features of PF events are reproduced by a model of stochastic trans-
fers [21]. Main characteristics for primary events with Ztot=20 are the fol-
lowing: i) excitation energy extends up to about 200 MeV, which allows the
large excitation energy domain (20-150 MeV) measured for N α sources when
associated to a single fragment, and ii) angular momenta extend up to 24,
which gives an upper spin limit for excited Ca projectiles and consequently
for N α sources.

Are α-particles emitted sequentially or simultaneously? To answer the
question α-energy spectra can be compared to simulations. For excited Ca
projectiles and N α sources, experimental velocity and excitation energy dis-
tributions as well as distributions for spins are used as inputs. Results of
simulations are then ﬁltered by the multi-detector replica including all de-
tection and identiﬁcation details. Simulated spectra are normalized to the
area of experimental spectra.

For sequential emission the GEMINI++ code [32, 33] was used. It com-
bines the Hauser-Feshbach formalism for evaporation of particles (Z < 5)
and the transition-state formalism for intermediate-mass fragment emission
(Z (cid:62) 5). Evaporation includes n, p, d, t, 3He, α-particles, 6He, 6−8Li and
7−10Be channels. For fragment emission, the saddle conditional energy for
diﬀerent mass (or charge) asymmetries is deduced from the ﬁnite range rotat-
ing liquid-drop model [34]. Note that emitted 8Be are directly transformed
into two α-particles.

to a 24M g (left) or to an 16O (right) evaporation residue. Black dots are experimental
data and histograms are results of GEMINI++ simulations (see text).

Before discussing decays of N α sources, we must consider the possible
evaporation from Ca projectiles as stated previously. Excitation energy for
projectiles is deduced from E∗=E∗(N α)+Erel+Q. Erel is the relative energy
between the N α source and the associated fragment (evaporation residue).
Fig. 6 (left) displays, for Mα=4, results of simulations (histograms) with re-
constructed excitation energy distribution for 40Ca (< E∗ >=68.8 MeV) and
gaussian distributions centered at 15 and 25 for spins as inputs. Mα=4 and
24M g residues are the decay products after ﬁltering. A similar comparison
is displayed in Fig. 6 (right) for Mα=6; excitation energy distribution for
40Ca is centered at < E∗ >=99.7 MeV. RMSs used for spin distributions,
around 2.0-2.5, were deduced from the correlation “excitation energy-spin”
obtained with the model of stochastic transfers [21]. Note that no more 24M g,
20N e or 16O residues are produced in simulations for 40Ca spin distributions
centered at values larger than 25. Comparisons with experimental data
(full points) show a poor agreement indicating that such an hypothesis of
sequential decay from excited projectiles is not correct. The same conclusion
is derived for Mα equal 5 [35].

Considering sequential deexcitation of N α sources, histograms in Fig. 5
(left) are examples of GEMINI++ simulation results for N α=4 (16O*) and

the best agreement with data is obtained with RMS=1.5 for spin distribu-
tions. The agreement between data and simulations becomes progressively
poorer as the N α value decreases. However, the most important disagree-
ment between data and simulations concerns the percentages of N α sources
which deexcite via 8Be (see Table 2). With the excitation energy distribu-
tions experimentally deduced the GEMINI++ code evaporates an important
percentage of 8Be along the deexcitation chain and at the last evaporation
step of the chain leaving an unstable 8Be residue. This strong constraint is
not experimentally observed.

For simultaneous emission from N α sources, a dedicated simulation was
done which mimics a situation in which α clusters are early formed when the
N α source is expanding [12, 13] due to thermal pressure. By respecting the
experimental excitation energy distributions of N α sources, a distribution of
N α events is generated as starting point of the simulation. Event by event,
the N α source is ﬁrst split into α’s. Then the remaining available energy
(E∗ + Q) is directly randomly shared among the α-particles such as to con-
serve energy and linear momentum [36]. Histograms in Fig. 5 (right) are the
results of such a simulation, which show a good agreement with data. Similar
calculated energy spectra were also obtained with simulations containing an
intermediate freeze-out volume stage where α-particles are formed and then
propagation of particles in their mutual Coulomb ﬁeld. In this case angular
momentum distributions of N α sources at freeze-out can also be deduced:
they exhibit a Maxwell-like shape extending up to 25 for N α=6 while mean
values vary from 6.7 to 9.5 when N α moves from 4 to 6. Note that 8Be
emission is out of the scope of the present simulation.

From these comparisons with both sequential and simultaneous decay
simulations it clearly appears that sequential emission is not able to repro-
duce experimental data whereas a remarkable agreement is obtained when
an α-clustering scenario is assumed. Same conclusion is derived for N α equal
5 [35]. However one cannot exclude that a small percentage of N α sources,
those produced with lower excitation energies, sequentially deexcite.

In conclusion, the reaction 40Ca+12C at 25 MeV per nucleon bombarding
energy was used to produce and carefully select speciﬁc classes of projectile
fragmentation events from which excited N α sources can be unambiguously
identiﬁed. Their excitation energy distributions are derived with mean values
around 3.4 MeV per nucleon and a crude estimation of their mean minimal
densities, around 0.7 the normal density, can be deduced.

12

Their energetic emission properties were compared with two simulations,
one involving sequential decays and a second for simultaneous decays. For
excited expanding N α sources composed of 4, 5 and 6 α-particles, for which
statistics is good enough for conclusive comparisons with simulations, evi-
dence in favor of simultaneous emission (α-particle clustering) is reported.
Those results support mean ﬁeld calculations of Refs. [12, 13].
