Transverse Mode Coupling Instability with Space Charge

P.O. Box 500, Batavia, Illinois 60510∗

(Dated: March 22, 2016)

Transverse mode coupling instability of a bunch with space charge and wake ﬁeld is considered
in frameworks of the boxcar model. Eigenfunctions of the bunch without wake are used as the
basis for solution of the equations with the wake ﬁeld included. Dispersion equation for the bunch
eigentunes is presented in the form of an inﬁnite continued fraction and also as the recursive relation
with arbitrary number of the basis functions. It is shown that the inﬂuence of space charge on the
instability essentially depends on the wake sign.
In particular, threshold of the negative wake
increases in absolute value until the space charge tune shift is rather small, and goes down at higher
space charge. The explanation is developed by analysis of the bunch spectrum. A comparison of
the results with published articles is performed.

INTRODUCTION

Transverse Mode Coupling Instability has been ob-
served ﬁrst in PETRA and explained by Kohaupt in the
base of two-particle model [1]. Many papers concerning
this eﬀect were published later, including handbooks and
surveys (see e.g. [2]). It is established that the instability
appears as a result of the coalescence of two neighboring
head-tail modes due to the bunch wake ﬁeld.

TMCI with space charge was considered ﬁrst by Blask-
iewicz [3]. The main conclusion which has be done in the
paper and many times quoted is that SC raises the TMCI
threshold that is improve the beam stability.

The problem has been investigated later in the limit-
ing case of very high SC when the tune shift signiﬁcantly
exceeds synchrotron tune [4, 5]. It was conﬁrmed that
SC can stabilize TMCI suppressing the instability at all
in considered limiting case (“vanished TMCI” [4]). How-
ever, it was shown in Ref. [5] that this statement can be
true only for negative wakes whereas positive ones im-
pair the stability resulting in a monotonous falling of the
TMCI threshold when the SC tune shift increases.

Numerical simulation of the instability conﬁrmed these
results on the whole demonstrating the predicted eﬀects
with positive and negative wakes [6]

So called three-mode model has been developed in
Ref. [7] for analytical description of the TMCI with chro-
maticity and moderate SC. The results provided with
help of this simple model appear in good consent with
those mentioned above.

However, it would be prematurely to declare the prob-
lem settled because there are some lacunae and contra-
dictions in the commented papers.

A non-monotonic dependence of the TMCI parame-
ters on the SC tune shift has been actually obtained in
Ref. [3]. It was shown that the stability and instability

regions can change each other when the tune shift in-
creases. What is more, the solutions depend on number
of used basic vectors demonstrating not very well conver-
gence.

Numerical solutions in Ref. [6] sometimes demonstrate
a non-monotonic dependence of the threshold on tune
shift as well. However, number of considered alternatives
is too small to make sure conclusions.

The statements of papers [4] and [5] relating to nega-
tive wakes are questionable because negative multipoles
(m < 0) have been excluded from the consideration due
to the basis assumptions. Meanwhile, it is known that
the coupling of the multipoles m = 0 and m = −1 is the
main factor resulting in the TMCI without space charge.
Therefore, a veriﬁcation and an explanation of these re-
sults are desirable.

Only the case of modest space charge ∆Qsc/Qs < 3
has been investigated in Ref.
[7] demonstrating that
TMCI threshold of negative wake goes up when the
tune shift increases. However, used equations allow
a sudden kink of the threshold curve at the higher
shift. This case was not commented in the paper being
treated as a not quite reliable. However, ﬁeld of appli-
cation of the three-mode model is still the open question.

These problems are considered in presented paper by
the example of square bunch (the boxcar model). Advan-
tage of this model is that set of its eigenmodes without
wake is known exactly, providing very convenient basis
for consideration of the TMCI problem in depth.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS

The terms, basic symbols and equations accepted in
Ref. [5] and [7] will be used in this paper.
In partic-
ular, linear synchrotron oscillations are considered here
being characterized by amplitude A and phase φ, or by
corresponding Cartesian coordinates:

∗Electronic address: balbekov@fnal.gov

θ = A cos φ,

u = A sin φ.

(1)

Thus θ is the azimuthal deviation of a particle from the
bunch center in the rest frame, and variable u is pro-
portional to the momentum deviation about the bunch
central momentum (coeﬃcient of proportionality is not
a factor in the paper). Transverse coherent displacement
of particles in some point of longitudinal phase space is
presented as real part of the function

X(A, φ, t) = Y (A, φ) exp(cid:2) − i(Q0 + ζ) θ − i (Q0 + ν) Ω0t(cid:3)(2)

where Ω0 is the revolution frequency, Q0 is the central
betatron tune, and ν is the tune addition produced by
the wake ﬁeld. Generally, ζ is the normalized chromatic-
ity, however, only the case ζ = 0 will be investigated in
this paper. Besides, we restrict the consideration by the
simplest case of the wake ﬁeld which has constant value
within the bunch being zero behind it. Then the function
Y satisﬁes the equation [7]:

III. BOXCAR MODEL

The boxcar model is characterized by following expres-
sions for the bunch distribution function and its linear
density:

F =

1

2π√1 − A2

=

1

2π√1 − θ2 − u2

,

(10a)

ρ(θ) =

1
2

at

|θ| < 1

(10b)

Analytical solutions of Eq. (6) for this model have been
found ﬁrst by Sacherer [8]. The most important point is
that the eigenfunctions ¯Yj are proportional to Legendre
polynomials: ¯Yn(θ) ∝ Pn(θ), n = 0, 1, 2, . . . . With any
n, there are n+1 diﬀerent eigenmodes which will be sym-
bolized further as {n, m} where m = n, n − 2, . . . , −n.
Consequently, the functions Yn,m satisfy the equation

(3)

(νn,m + ∆Q) Yn,m + i Qs

∂Yn,m

∂φ

= ∆Q Sn,mPn(θ) (11)

where F (θ, u) and ρ(θ) are normalized distribution
function and corresponding linear density of the bunch,
Qs is the synchrotron tune, ∆Q(θ) is the space charge
tune shift, and ¯Y (θ) is the bunch displacement in usual
space which can be found by the formula

ρ(θ) ¯Y (θ) =Z F (θ, u)Y (θ, u) du

(4)

Parameter q is reduced wake strength which is connected
with usual wake ﬁeld function W1 by the relation:

q =

r0RN W1
8πβγQ0

(5)

with r0 = e2/mc2 as the classic radius of the particle, R
as the accelerator radius, N as the bunch population, β
and γ as normalized velocity and energy.

Eigenfunctions of similar equation without wake will

be used further. They satisfy the equation

where star means complex conjugation. Therefore, look-
ing for the solution of Eq. (3) in the form

one can get following series for the coeﬃcients Cj:

with the coeﬃcients Sn,m which should be taken to sat-
isfy normalization condition (7). Solutions of the equa-
tion can be found as polynomials of power n in (θ − u)
space. Some its eigentunes νn,m are plotted in Fig. 1. It
is seen that, without space charge, index m is the mul-
tipole number, whereas the index n is associated with
number of radial mode (at given m, the larger n marks
the lower radial mode, for example {3, 3} means the low-
est radial mode of 3rd multipole). At ∆Q 6= 0, the mul-
tipoles mix together, and the eigentunes break down into
2 groups. In the ﬁrst, all tunes are positive values which
tend to 0 at ∆Q → ∞. By origin, they are the lowest

Solution of the series is trivial at nmax = 0: T0 = 0
that is ν = q. It describes the wake contribution to the
tune of the lowest (rigid) eigenmode of the bunch. Of
course, TMCI can not appear in this approximation, and
the simplest equation to disclose it is T1(ν) = 0 or, in
accordance with Eq. (19)-(20),

Then Eq. (12) is reduced to

ZN = q WNXn

RN,nZn

(15)

It is important for the solution that the matrix R is “al-
most empty”. Its small fragment is presented in Table I,
and general form at n 6= 0 is:

RN,n = −

δN −1,n

(2n − 1)(2n + 1)

+

δN +1,n

(2n + 1)(2n + 3)

(16)

Besides, it is easy to show that ν0,0 = 0, S0,0 = 1, that
is W0 = 1/ν. Using these features, one can represent the
solvability condition of series (15), that is the dispersion
equation for the eigentunes of the system, as the inﬁnite
continue fraction

ν − q = −

(q/3)2W1

1 + (q/15)2W1W2
1+ (q/35)2 W2W3

1+.........

(17)

Of course, the fraction should be truncated to get an ob-
servable equation. Assuming Wn = 0 at n ≥ nmax and
assigning corresponding truncated expression as Tnmax,
one can write the dispersion equation as

Tnmax(ν) = 0

This third order equation absolutely coincides with
Eq. (7.3) of Ref. [7] (without chromaticity) despite the
fact that very diﬀerent concepts have been used to de-
rive them. However, the examples presented in [7] have
been restricted by the modest space charge: ∆Q/Qs < 3.

from red to green oval. Single instability space appears at
∆Q/Qs > 3.6 by coalescence of there regions. Its right bound-
ary moves to the right i.e. the threshold goes down when ∆Q
increases.

FIG. 3: Real part of the boxcar bunch eigentunes against the
wake amplitude at diﬀerent space charge tune shifts. With
negative wake, coalescence of the modes {0, 0} + {1, −1}
causes the instability at ∆/Qs < 3.465 (black and blue lines).
The combination {0, 0} + {1, 1} joins after that (red and
green) to become dominating at ∆Q/Qs > 3.6 (violet).

The situation beyond this region should be explored for
further development of the techniques.

Some solutions of Eq. (21) are shown in Fig. 2 and
Fig. 3. With positive wake, their behavior is rather clear:
the TMCI threshold goes down when space charge in-
creases. The case of negative wake is more complicated
and requires special comments.

According to Fig. 2 where imaginary part of the solu-
tions is presented against q , the instability threshold is
|qth/Qs| = 0.567 at ∆Q/Qs = 0. Then it increases in
absolute value reaching qth/Qs ≃ −4 at ∆Q/Qs = 3.46.
The new and essential fact is that an additional re-
gion of instability appears after that. It increases very
rapidly occupying the region −3.9 < q/Qs < −3.1
at ∆Q/Qs = 3.5 (red oval in the ﬁgure). Then, at
∆Q/Qs = 3.6 , the old and new instability regions merge
together creating the integrated space.
Its right-hand
boundary, that is the TMCI threshold, moves to the right
(the threshold goes down) if the space charge tune shift
continues to grow up.

An additional information is provided by Fig. 3 where
real part of the solutions is shown.
It is seen that, at
∆Q/Qs < 3.46, the TMCI appears as a result of coales-
cence of the modes {0, 0} and {1,−1} . However, the
mode {1, 1} comes into the play at higher tune shift. In
the beginning, it forms own region of instability by cou-
pling with mode {0, 0} (red lines), but eventually all the
modes merge together forming the united space.
Total region of stability in (∆Q − q) plane is shown
in Fig. 4 with both positive and negative wakes being
taken into account (black and red lines). The compli-
cated shape of the red curve is explained just by the
additional instability region which appears separately at

FIG. 5:
The bunch eigentunes on boundaries of the sta-

result of coalescence of the modes {0, 0} and {1, 1} (black
lines). With negative wake, the modes {0, 0} + {1, −1} coa-
lesce at ∆Q/Qs < 3.46 , and {0, 0} + {1, 1} modes do it at
∆Q/Qs > 3.6. There is a transition region where all tunes
about coincide.

∆Q/Qs = −3.46 but joint the main area shortly after
that.
Eigentunes on boundary of this area are shown in
Fig. 5. Generally, there are 3 real roots in the sta-
bility region but at least 2 of them coincides on the
boundary. Therefore not more than 2 lines of each
color are visible in the picture. With negative wake, the
modes {0, 0} + {1,−1} coalesce at ∆Q/Qs < 3.45 , and
{0, 0} + {1, 1} modes do it at ∆Q/Qs > 3.6. There is
a transition region where all tunes about coincide. The
black curves for positive wake are very simple: the top

Its real roots can be found numerically with any needed
accuracy. Number of the roots is 6 but only 5 diﬀerent
ones can appear in the boundary of the stability region.
It is just the way to ﬁnd the threshold wake value as well
as corresponding eigentunes of the system with any ∆Q.

The method can be used for analysis of higher ap-
proximations as well, thought corresponding formulae are
more cumbersome. Generally, it leads to the algebraic
equation of power (nmax + 1)(nmax + 2)/2 where nmax
is power of highest Legendre polynomial in using.

Some results of the calculations are represented in
Fig. 7-8 where qth/Qs is plotted against ∆Q/Qs at
nmax = 1 − 10. It should be noted at once that eﬀect
of positive wake almost does not depend on the power
and can be reasonably described by three-mode Eq. (21).
Therefore only the case of negative wake is described be-
low.

The curves in Fig. 7-8 are well converging, so that any
approximations nmax ≥ 6 can be safely used with any
∆Q providing qth ≃ −50 Q2
s/∆Q at ∆Q/Qs > 7. How-
ever, the lower order approximations could be suﬃcient
if the tune shift is not so large. In particular, the three-
mode approximation (nmax = 1) provides well accuracy
at ∆Q/Qs < 3.5, and the case nmax = 5 (21 modes) is
applicable up to ∆Q/Qs = 6. It is necessary to pay an

additional instability region is seen here as well (red line).

V. HIGHER APPROXIMATIONS

Higher approximations should be considered now to
validate the three-mode model, to establish area of its
applicability, and to go beyond this area. First step in
this direction is to solve equation T2(ν) = 0. According
to Eq. (19)-(20), its expanded form is

attention to the narrow strip of instability which is shown
by dashed lines in left Fig. 5 and becomes apparent at
nmax ≥ 3 . Its origin is explained below.
Important conclusions can be derived by analysis of the
bunch spectra that is threshold tunes νth(∆Q). First ex-
ample has been presented in Fig. 5 when the three-mode
approximation (nmax = 1) has been investigated. It was
shown that the sudden veer of the curve νth(∆Q) hap-
pens when the tune coupling switches from the modes
{0, 0}+{1,−1} to the {0, 0}+{1, 1} (recall that negative
wake is discussed in this paragraph). Similar behavior of
the spectra is demonstrated in Fig. 9-10 where the ap-
proximations nmax = 4 and nmax = 7 are considered. In
both (and other) cases the TMCI starts as a coupling of
the modes {0, 0} +{1,−1} which are shown by magenta
lines in the pictures. Then it follows to higher modes
(orange lines) through several intermediate stages which
are shown by the bold lines as well. Just these short-
time conjunctions are responsible for the dashed strip in
Fig. 7. Perhaps, there are other similar zones but they
are elusive because of small size.
It is interesting that
one of them happens in Fig. 10 as a coupling of radial
modes of the same multipole: m = 1, n = 3 and 5. How-
ever, only lowest radial modes take the part eventually:
{3, 3} + {4, 4} in Fig. 9 and {4, 4} + {5, 5} in Fig. 10.
It is important to emphasize that these eventual modes
occur on the edge of basis vector set in Fig. 9, and they
are situated inside the set in Fig. 10. It indicates that
the saturation is achieved at nmax = 6, and additional
basis vectors no longer aﬀect the mode coupling.

The case of positive wake is simpler: TMCI is caused by
a coupling of the modes {0, 0} + {1, 1} at any ∆Q , and
three-mode approximation is suﬃcient for the calculation
resulting in the threshold formula

paper. The TMCI growth rate is plotted in the graph
against the tune shift at ﬁxed wake strength which cor-
responds to q = −1.13 in the accepted units. The same
function is plotted in lower Fig. 11 which is calculated
with help of Eq. (21). It would be possible to tell about
amazing similarity of the pictures if not the diﬀerence of
the horizontal scales. According to the upper graph, the
space between two instability regions is ∆Q/Qs = 1.4
whereas it should be about 3 times more by the bottom
plot. Another important thing is that the second region
of instability appears only in the high-mode approxima-
tion nmax = 10 in the upper picture. However, it would
be situated far to the right (∆Q/Qs >∼ 45) if corre-
sponding high-order approximation is used for the lower

graph. Therefore, one can ﬁrmly declare a good agree-
ment of these results only at ∆Q/Qs <∼ 2.
There is a better consent with Ref. [6] where the re-
sults of numerical simulations are represented. Shape of
the threshold curve with negative wake is very similar
to Fig. 7 at ∆Q/Qs ≤ 6, and there is a rather good
quantitative agreement. For example, both papers give
qth/Qs ≃ −6.5 at ∆Q/Qs = 5. Thresholds of positive
wakes are in a full consent as well.
The case ∆Q → ∞ is more complicated and requires
a careful consideration.
It follows from Fig. 7-8 and
Eq. (27)-(28) that the TMCI threshold tends to 0 in
this limit. In contrast, it was argued in papers [4] and
[5] that negative wake can’t cause TMCI at all at such
conditions (”vanished TMCI [4]”). It was noted in the
Introduction that this statement is questionable because
negative multipoles have been actually excluded from the
consideration in the mentioned papers. However, we can
see now that this objection is certainly essential only at
∆Q/Qs <∼ 7 and maybe is not so important at higher
∆Q where the instability is caused just by coupling of
positive multipoles (see Fig. 10).

It should be noted in this connection that central equa-
tions of the quoted papers could be solved for the boxcar
bunch by the method which is developed in this paper.
It would result in Eq. (17) with the additional relations:

which are simply the asymptotic values of these parame-
ters at ∆Q → ∞. However, truncation of signiﬁcant part
of the spectrum required by Eq. (29a) crucially changes
the result. It is illustrated by Fig. 12 which is obtained

ent nmax. The graph drastic diﬀers from Fig. 8 though
both of them are calculated by the same method but
with/without the truncation.

Despite poor convergence of the curves in Fig. 12, trend
to the threshold growth is evident. However, it is seen
now that this conclusion is unreliable and should be re-
jected. At the same time, the basis set of eigenfunctions
(Legendre polynomials) is beyond questions as well as the
TMCI threshold with positive wakes. Besides that, more
realistic distributions like Gaussian have been considered
in [4]-[5] with the same results. Presented paper can’t be
applied in this case at once, so the issue remains open.

VII. SUMMARY

Being stable in themselves, eigenmodes of the boxcar
bunch with space charge form convenient and eﬀective
basis for investigation of the bunch instability with space
charge and wake ﬁeld. Dispersion equation acquired by
this method is represented in the form of inﬁnite contin-
ued fraction as well as in the form of recursive relation
with arbitrary number of the basis functions included.

It is shown that the space charge inﬂuence on the in-
stability essentially depends on the wake sign. TMCI
threshold of positive wake goes down monotonously when

8

the space charge tune shift increases as it is approxi-
mately described by Eq. (28). The negative wake thresh-
old goes up in absolute value if ∆Q/Qs < 7 , and
goes down at higher ∆Q/Qs, Eq. (27). Such a com-
plicated behavior occurs because the coalescence of dif-
ferent modes is responsible for the instability at diﬀerent
∆Q/Qs. If the wake is negative, the multipoles m = 0
and m = −1 are coupled at lower ∆Q and m = 6 − 7
at higher one. The rearrangement comes with an abrupt
dog-leg of the threshold curve. With positive wake, the
multipoles m = 0 and m = 1 are responsible for the
instability at any tune shift resulting in monotonous de-
crease of the threshold.

There is a satisfactory agreement with published pa-
pers aside from Ref. [4], [5] where the TMCI vanishing
is predicted in the limiting case ∆Q → ∞ with negative
wake. The contradiction can be explained by undue trun-
cation of the basis set which has been actually applied in
the quoted papers.
