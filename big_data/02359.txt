Abstract

The quasiconformal method provides us with a uniﬁed approach to
the construction of minimal unitary representations (minrep) of non-
compact groups, their deformations as well as their supersymmetric
extensions. We review the quasiconformal construction of the min-
rep of SO(d, 2), its deformations and their applications to unitary
realizations of AdS(d+1)/CF Td higher spin algebras and their defor-
mations for arbitrary d and supersymmetric extensions for d ≤ 6.
AdS(d+1)/CF Td higher spin algebras, their deformations and super-
symmetric extensions are given by the enveloping algebras of the qua-
siconformal realizations of the minrep, its deformations and supersym-
metric extensions, respectively, and are in one-to-one correspondence
with massless conformal ﬁelds for arbitrary d and massless conformal
supermultiplets for d ≤ 6.

Introduction

The minimal unitary representation (minrep) of a noncompact Lie group,
as deﬁned by Joseph [1], is realized over an Hilbert space of functions that
depend on the smallest number of variables possible. The mathematics lit-
erature on minreps of noncompact groups is quite extensive. We refer to
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and the references therein. Af-
ter the discovery of the novel geometric quasiconformal realizations of non-
compact groups[15, 16] a uniﬁed approach to their minreps was developed.
The minimal unitary realization is obtained by quantization of the geometric
quasiconformal action. This was ﬁrst carried out explicitly for the largest
exceptional group E8(8) [17] which is the U-duality group of maximal super-
gravity in three dimensions. The minrep of the 3d U-duality group E8(−24)
of the exceptional supergravity [18] via the quasiconformal approach was
constructed in [19]. A uniﬁed approach to the construction of the minreps
of noncompact groups by quantizing their quasiconformal actions was for-
mulated in [20]. The results of [20] extend to the minreps of noncompact
superalgebras g whose even subalgebras are of the form h ⊕ sl(2, R) where h
is compact. The quasiconformal construction of the minreps of non-compact
Lie algebras SU(n, m|p + q) and OSp(2N∗|2M) were subsequently developed
in [21, 22, 23]2
The quasiconformal construction of the minrep of AdS5/CF T4 group
SU(2, 2) and its supersymmetric extensions SU(2, 2|N) were studied in [21].
The minrep of SU(2, 2) describes a massless scalar ﬁeld in 4d.
It admits
a one parameter (ζ) family of deformations labelled by helicity, which can
be continuous3. For a positive (negative) integer value of ζ, the deformed

minrep describes a massless conformal ﬁeld transforming in(cid:0)0 , ζ

representation of the Lorentz group. The minrep and its deformations for in-
teger ζ are isomorphic to the doubleton representations of SU(2, 2) that were
constructed using covariant twistorial oscillators[24, 25, 26]. Similarly, the
minrep of SU(2, 2| N) and its deformations for integer ζ are isomorphic to
the doubleton supermultiplets that were studied in [24, 25, 26].The minimal
unitary supermultiplet of P SU(2, 2|4) is the N = 4 Yang-Mills supermulti-
plet in d = 4 that was ﬁrst constructed as a CPT self-conjugate . doubleton
supermuliplet in [24].

2We will use the notation for labelling Lie (super)groups and Lie (super)algebras in-

terchangeably throughout the paper.

3The parameter ζ is twice the helicity.

2

The minrep of AdS7/CF T6 group SO(6, 2) = SO∗(8) and its deforma-
tions were constructed in [22]. The deformations of the minrep of SO(6, 2)
are labelled by the ”spin” t of an SU(2) subgroup . The SU(2) spin t is the
analog of helicity in six dimensions. The minrep of SO∗(8) and its defor-
mations describe massless conformal ﬁelds in six dimensions. These results
were then extended to 6d superconformal algebras OSp(8∗|2N) [22, 23]. The
minimal unitary supermultiplet of OSp(8∗|4) describes the massless confor-
mal (2, 0) supermultiplet in 6d, which was ﬁrst constructed as a doubleton
supermultiplet in [27].

The quasiconformal realizations of minreps of noncompact groups are
in general nonlinear involving operators that are cubic and quartic in the
coordinates and momenta. However for symplectic groups quasiconformal
construction of the minrep coincides with the oscillator construction involv-
ing bilinears of twistorial oscillators[20]. Hence the minrep of AdS4/CF T3
group Sp(4, R) is simply the scalar singleton of Dirac and it admits a sin-
gle deformation which is the spinor singleton. They were referred to as the
remarkable representations of AdS4 group by Dirac [28]. The singleton su-
permultiplets of AdS4 superalgebras OSp(2n|4, R) , in particular the N = 8
superalgebra OSp(8|4, R), were ﬁrst constructed in [29, 30] using the oscil-
lator methods developed earlier [31, 32]. Oscillator construction of general
supermultiplets of OSp(N|4, R) was later given in [27, 33].
All the massless higher spin representations of AdS4 group SO(3, 2) occur
in the tensor product of two singleton representations [34]. The higher spin
theories in AdS4 were studied extensively by Fronsdal and collaborators [35,
36, 37, 38]. In the 1980s Fradkin and Vasiliev pioneered the study of higher
spin theories involving ﬁelds containing inﬁnitely many spins 0 ≤ s < ∞
[39, 40]. Much work has been done on higher spin theories in the intervening
years, in particular after the work of [41] who conjectured that Vasiliev’s
higher spin theory[42] in AdS4 is dual to O(N) vector model in 3d. The
conjecture of [41] was checked by Giombi and Yi by calculating some of the
three point functions of higher spin currents in the bulk and matching them
with those of free and critical O(N) vector models in 3d [43, 44]. For reviews
on higher spin theories we refer to [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51] and references
therein.

That the Fradkin-Vasiliev higher spin algebra in AdS4 [39] is the en-
veloping algebra of the singletonic realization of Sp(4, R) was ﬁrst pointed
out in [52]. Again in [52] it was suggested that the higher spin algebras
of Fradkin-Vasiliev type in AdS5 and AdS7 can similarly be obtained from

3

the doubletonic realizations of SU(2, 2) and SO(6, 2) , respectively. Higher
spin superalgebras in AdS4, AdS5 and AdS7 could then be realized as en-
veloping algebras of the singletonic realization of OSp(N/4, R) and double-
tonic realizations of SU(2, 2|N) and OSp(8∗|2N)[52]. Conformal higher spin
superalgebras in four dimensions were studied in [53]. Higher spin theo-
ries and supersymmetric extensions in AdS5 and AdS7 were studied later in
[54, 55, 56, 57] using the doubletonic realizations of [27, 26, 25, 58]. Higher
spin superalgebras in higher dimensions were also studied in [59].

Vasiliev pointed out that to obtain the standart bosonic higher spin alge-
bra in AdS(d+1), one has to quotient the enveloping algebra of SO(d, 2) by the
ideal that annihilates the scalar “singleton” representation [46]. Later East-
wood identiﬁed this ideal to be the Joseph ideal [60]. This is consistent with
the observation that AdS4/CF T3 higher spin algebra is given by the envelop-
ing algebra of the singletonic realization of SO(3, 2)[52] since the Joseph ideal
vanishes identically for the singleton. However the Joseph ideal does not van-
ish identically as operators for the doubletonic realizations of SO(4, 2) and
SO(6, 2) in terms of covariant twistorial oscillators. This is where the impor-
tance of quasiconformal approach to the construction of higher spin algebras
and superalgebras and their deformations becomes manifest. The Joseph
ideal vanishes identically as operators in the quasiconformal construction of
the minrep of SO(d, 2) and hence its enveloping algebra leads directly to the
higher spin algebra without the need for quotienting. This approach also
allows one to deﬁne deformations and supersymmetric extensions of higher
spin algebras.

The vanishing of the Joseph ideal for the quasiconformal realization of
minreps of SO(4, 2) and SO(6, 2) was shown in [61, 62]. Hence their envelop-
ing algebras lead directly to unitary realizations of the bosonic AdS5/CF T4
and AdS7/CF T6 higher spin algebras, respectively. The enveloping algebras
of the deformed minreps of SU(2, 2) and of SO∗(8) and their supersymmetric
extensions yield inﬁnite families of AdS5/CF T4 and AdS7/CF T6 higher spin
algebras and superalgebras, respectively [61, 62].

These results were extended to AdS6/CF T5 higher spin algebra in [63].
The minrep of SO(5, 2) admits a unique deformation which describes a
conformally massless spinor ﬁeld in 5d.
In ﬁve dimensions there exists a
unique simple conformal superalgebra , namely F (4) with the even subalge-
bra SO(5, 2) ⊕ SU(2). The minimal unitary supermultiplet of F (4) decom-
poses into the deformed minrep and two copies of the minrep. Its enveloping
algebra deﬁnes the unique higher spin superalgebra in AdS6.

4

Extension of the above results to higher dimensions was given in [64]
where it was shown that the minrep of SO(d, 2) and its deformations are in
one-to-one correspondence with massless conformal ﬁelds in d dimensional
spacetimes. For the quasiconformal realization of the minrep of SO(d, 2)
generators of the Joseph ideal vanish and its enveloping algebra yields di-
rectly the AdS(d+1)/CF Td higher spin algebra. The enveloping algebra of a
deformation of the minrep leads to a deformed higher spin algebra. In odd
dimensions there exists a unique deformation. In even dimensions there ex-
ist inﬁnitely many deformations whose enveloping algebras deﬁne an inﬁnite
family of higher spin algebras.

Below we will review the quasiconformal realization of SO(d, 2) and its
quantization that leads directly to the minimal unitary representation of
SO(d, 2). We shall then discuss the deformations of the minrep and show that
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the minrep and its deformations
and massless conformal ﬁelds in d dimensional Minkowskian spacetimes. This
will be followed by a review of the application of these results to higher spin
algebras, their deformations and supersymmetric extensions.

2 Geometric realization of SO(d, 2) as a qua-

siconformal group

The geometric quasiconformal realization of the anti-de Sitter (conformal)
group SO(d, 2) in (d + 1) (d) dimensions that was given in [16] is based on
the 5-grading of the Lie algebra so(d, 2) with respect to its maximal rank
subalgebra so(1, 1) ⊕ so(d − 2) ⊕ so(2, 1) :

so(d, 2) = 1(−2)⊕(d − 2, 2)(−1)⊕[ ∆ ⊕ so(d − 2) ⊕ su(1, 1) ]0⊕(d − 2, 2)(+1)⊕1(+2)
where the generator that determines the ﬁve grading is denoted as ∆. We
should stress that SO(d− 2) is the simple part of the little group of massless
particles in d-dimensional Minkowski space-time. The generators of quasicon-
formal group action of SO(d, 2) are realized as nonlinear diﬀerential operators
acting on a (2d − 3)-dimensional space T with coordinates X = (X i,a, x),
where X i,a transform in the (d − 2, 2) representation of so(d − 2) ⊕ su(1, 1)
subalgebra, with i = 1, . . . , d − 2 and a = 1, 2, and x is a singlet coordinate.
Labelling the generators with grade −2,−1, 0, +1 and +2 as K−, Ui,a, [∆⊕
Lij ⊕Mab], eUi,a and K+, respectively, their quasiconformal realizations have

where Lij and Mab are the generators of SO(d− 2) and SU(1, 1) subgroups,
respectively,(i, j, k, l = 1, . . . , d−2 ; a, b, c, d = 1, 2) and ǫab is the inverse sym-
plectic tensor, such that ǫabǫbc = δa
c . I4(X) denotes the quartic polynomial
of the coordinates X i,a

∂X i,a

,

I4(X) = ηijηklǫacǫbdX i,aX j,bX k,cX l,d

(2.2)

which is an invariant of SO(d − 2) × SU(1, 1) subgroup4.
In the above
expression, ǫab is the symplectic invariant tensor of SU(1, 1) and ηij is the
invariant metric of SO(d − 2) in the fundamental representation, which we
choose as ηij = −δij to be consistent with the conventions of [16].
The grade +1 generators eUi,a are obtained by substituting the expression
for the quartic invariant in the above equations:

eUi,a = [Ui,a , K+]

= ηijǫad(cid:0)ηklǫbcX j,bX k,cX l,d − x X j,d(cid:1) ∂

The generators of SO(d, 2) satisfy the following commutation relations:

[Lij , Lkl] = ηjkLil − ηikLjl − ηjlLik + ηilLjk

[Mab , Mcd] = ǫcbMad + ǫcaMbd + ǫdbMac + ǫdaMbc
4Note that we have the isomorphisms SU (1, 1) ≡ SO(2, 1) ≡ Sp(2, R).

(2.4d)

hUi,a , eUj,bi = ηijǫab ∆ − 2 ǫabLij − ηijMab

The above nonlinear realization has a geometric interpretation as the
invariance group of a light-cone with respect to a quartic distance function
in the space T . The quartic norm of a vector X = (X, x) in the (2d − 3)-
dimensional space T is given as

N4 (X ) = I4 (X) + 2 x2 .

(2.5)

and the quartic distance function between any two points X and Y in T is
then deﬁned as follows: [17, 20]

d (X ,Y) = N4 (δ (X ,Y))

(2.6)

(2.7)

where the “symplectic” diﬀerence δ (X ,Y) is deﬁned as

δ (X ,Y) =(cid:0)X i,a − Y i,a , x − y − ηijǫab X i,aY j,b(cid:1) = −δ (Y,X ) .

The lightlike separations between any two points with respect to this quartic
distance function are left invariant under the quasiconformal group action of
SO(d, 2) on T .

3 Minimal unitary representation of SO(d, 2)

from its quasiconformal realization

The ”quantization” of the geometric quasiconformal realization of a noncom-
pact group leads directly to its minimal unitary representation [17, 19, 16,

7

20, 64]. To ”quantize” the quasiconformal realization of SO(d, 2), we split
the 2(d − 2) variables X i,a deﬁned in section 2 into (d − 2) coordinates X i
and (d − 2) conjugate momenta Pi as

X i = X i,1

Pi = ηij X j,2

(3.1)

and introduce a momentum p conjugate to the singlet coordinate x as well.
Furthermore we treat them as quantum mechanical operators satisfying the
canonical commutation relations

(cid:2)X i , Pj(cid:3) = iδi

j

[x , p] = i .

(3.2)

Instead of the coordinates X i and momenta Pi it will be convenient to
work with bosonic oscillator annihilation operators ai and creation operators
a†i , deﬁned as

ai =

1

√2(cid:0)X i + i Pi(cid:1)

a†i =

1

√2(cid:0)X i − i Pi(cid:1)

They satisfy the commutation relations

hai , a†ji = δij

[ai , aj] =ha†i , a†ji = 0 .

For the minimal unitary realization of so(d, 2) the 5-grading

(3.3)

so(d, 2) = g(−2) ⊕ g(−1) ⊕ [ ∆ ⊕ so(d − 2)L ⊕ su(1, 1)M ] ⊕ g(+1) ⊕ g+2)

is determined by the SO(1, 1) generator

∆ =

The subalgebra so(d − 2)L ⊂ g(0) is also realized as bilinears of the bosonic
oscillators:

Lij = i(cid:16)a†i aj − a†jai(cid:17)

and satisfy the commutation relations

[Lij , Lkl] = i (δjkLil − δikLjl − δjlLik + δilLjk) .

The Casimir L2 of so(d − 2)L

C2 [so(d − 2)L] = L2 = LijLij

is related to the Casimir of su(1, 1)M as follows:

L2 = 8M2 −

The generators (Ui, U†i ) in grade −1 subspace are realized as bilinears of x
and the bosonic oscillators

Ui = x ai

U†i = x a†i .

(3.14)

They close into K− under commutation and form a Heisenberg subalgebra

The quartic invariant I4 of SO(d− 2)L × SU(1, 1)M subgroup that enters
the quasiconformal realization goes over to a linear function of the quadratic

so(d, 2) turns out to be

C2 [so(d, 2)] = −

(3.27)

The Lie algebra of SO(d, 2) admits a diﬀerent 5-grading determined by
the compact generator M0 in addition to the 5-grading determined by the
non-compact generator ∆. The resulting 5×5 grading is given in Table 1. We
should note that the generators of SO(d, 2) given above are not all Hermitian.
Since we are interested in unitary realizations one must go to a basis in which
all the generators at Hermitian ( anti-Hermitian) with pure imaginary (real)
structure constants and determine the real form corresponding to the unitary
realization , which in our case turns out to be SO(d, 2).

The little group of massless particles in d dimensional Minkowskian space-
time is the Euclidean group E(d−2) in (d− 2) dimensions acting on the trans-
verse coordinates whose Lie algebra is the semi-direct sum

e(d−2) = so(d − 2) s t(d−2)

where t(d−2) denotes the generators of translations. There are two diﬀerent
such embeddings of the Euclidean group E(d−2) , namely one acting on the
transverse coordinates Xi and the other acting on the transverse momenta
Pi inside the quasiconformal realization of SO(d, 2) which we shall denote as
EX

Therefore the quasiconformal realization of SO(d, 2) can be interpreted
as the minimal Lie algebra containing the Euclidean conformal Lie algebra

bra acting on the corresponding transverse momenta. The common subgroup
of these two Euclidean conformal groups is SO(d − 2).

3-grading of so(d, 2) as a conformal algebra
in d-dimensions

The conformal group SO(d, 2) in d-dimensional Minkowskian space-time are
generated by translations (Pµ ), special conformal generators (Kµ ) and
Lorentz (Mµν ) and scale tranformations (D). Its Lie algebra so(d, 2) has a
3-grading determined by the generator D of scale transformations ( dilata-

6 Hilbert Space of the Minimal Unitary Rep-

resentation

The conformal Hamiltonian ( or AdS energy operator) H, given in equation

H⊙ is the Hamiltonian of a singular harmonic oscillator. The role of the
coupling constant for the singular potential

x2

(6.3)

is played by the operator G given in equation (3.17). The Hamiltonian has
the same form as in conformal quantum mechanics of [65] as well as in the
Calogero models [66, 67].
It generates the compact U(1) subgroup of the
one-dimensional conformal group SO(2, 1) = SU(1, 1)K acting on the singlet
coordinate x. The other generators of SU(1, 1)K in the compact three grading
with respect to H⊙ are given by the following linear combinations

As a basis for the Hilbert space of the minimal unitary representation of
SO(d, 2) we shall consider states which are ”twisted tensor products” of the
states of the Fock space F of (d − 2) bosonic oscillators ai with the states
of the singular oscillator that furnish a unitary representation of SU(1, 1)5 .
The Fock space of the a-type oscillators is spanned by the states of the form

|n1, n2, . . . , nd−2i =Yi

1
√ni!

( a†i )ni |0i

(6.6)

where ni are non-negative integers and |0i is the corresponding Fock vacuum.
In the coordinate representation the state(s) with the lowest eigenvalue
of the conformal Hamiltonian H⊙ are wave-functions of the form

ψαg0
0

(x) = C0 xαg0 e−x2/2

(6.7)

5We use the term twisted tensor product since the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian of

the singular oscillator depend on the states of the Fock space F .

The state |ψ(d−3)/2

−1 generators C−M and transforms as a singlet of SO(d) subgroup. This shows
that the minrep is a unitary lowest weight ( positive energy) representation.
Furthermore it is annihilated by all the translation generators Ui of the little
group SO(d− 2)sT(d−2) of massless particles in d dimensions. Therefore the
minrep of SO(d, 2) describes a massless conformal scalar ﬁeld in d dimen-
sional Minkowskian spacetime. We refer to [64] for the K-type decomposition
of the minrep of SO(d, 2) with respect to its maximal compact subgroup.

7 Deformations of the minimal unitary rep-
resentation of SO(d, 2) and massless confor-
mal ﬁelds

The minrep of SO(d, 2) describes a conformally massless scalar ﬁeld in d
dimensions. In this section we shall review the ”deformations” of the min-
rep and establish their one-to-one correspondence with conformally massless
ﬁelds in d dimensional Minkoswkian spacetimes[64]. By a deformation we
mean adding spin terms Sij of the orbital generators Lij of the little group
SO(d − 2) of massless particles such that all the Jacobi identities are satis-
ﬁed.6:
(7.1)

Lij −→ Jij = Lij + Sij

This requirement leads to following expression for the generator K+ of the
deformed minrep:

K+ =

(7.2)

where J 2 = JijJij and S 2 = SijSij. Under the deformation the generators
M±,0 and ∆ in grade 0 subspace, Ui and U†i in grade −1 subspace, and K− in
grade −2 subspace of so(d, 2) remain unchanged. The grade +1 generators
Wi and W †i get modiﬁed as follows: :

(7.3)

(7.4)

Furthermore the spin generators Sij are required to satisfy the constraint:

∆ij = SikSjk + SjkSik −

2

(d − 2) S 2 δij = 0

which turn out to be the same constraint satisﬁed by little group generators
of massless representations of the Poincar´e group that extend to unitary rep-
resentations of the conformal group in d dimensions [68, 69]. This correspon-
dence between massless conformal ﬁelds in d dimensions and the minrep of

6 For d = 4 the little group is U (1) and deformations are parametrized by helicity which
can take on continuous values [21]. This explains the origin of the term ”deformation”
which has been used in all dimensions later.

19

SO(d, 2) and its deformations were established earlier for dimensions d = 4, 5
and 6 in [21, 22, 23, 63]. More recently this one-to-one correspondence was
extended to all spacetime dimensions in [64]. We should note that each de-
formation leads to a diﬀerent unitary realization of the SU(1, 1)K subgroup
and thus establishes a correspondence between massless conformal ﬁelds in
any dimension and the Calogero models.

For the deformed minrep one ﬁnds the following expressions for the Casimirs

of various subalgebras
C2 [so(d − 2)J] = JijJij = J 2
C2 [su(1, 1)M ] = M0

leading to following expression for the quadratic Casimir of so(d, 2)

C2 [so(d, 2)] =

1

2(cid:0)d2 − 4(cid:1) .

which agrees with the quadratic Casimir of the undeformed minrep of so(d, 2)
when S 2 = 0. The minrep and its deformations are unitary lowest weight (
positive energy) representations of SO(d, 2) that are uniquely determined by
the lowest energy irrep of SO(d) subgroup. Therefore we shall label them as

|E0, (n1,· · · nr)i

where E0 is the eigenvalue of H and (n1,· · · nr) are the Dynkin labels of
lowest energy irrep of SO(d).

7.1 Deformations in odd dimensions

It is well-known that the AdS4/CF T3 Lie algebra SO(3, 2) is isomorphic
to the symplectic Lie algebra Sp(4, R) whose minimal unitary representation

20

that describes a conformal scalar admits a single deformation which describes
a conformal spinor in 3 dimensions. They are simply the scalar and spinor
singletons of Dirac[70] which describe the only conformally massless ﬁelds in
d = 3. Similarly, the minrep of AdS6/CF T5 group SO(5, 2) admits a unique
deformation[63]. The minrep of SO(5, 2) and its deformation are the analogs
of Dirac singletons and decribe conformally massless scalar and spinor ﬁelds
in d = 5. This phenomenon extends to all conformal algebras so(d, 2) in
odd dimensions as a consequence of the fact that the constraint 7.4 for spin
terms Sij of SO(d − 2) that determine the deformations of the minrep has
a unique non-trivial solution for odd d. It is simply the 2( d−3
2 ) dimensional
spinor irrep of SO(d − 2) generated by

4

[γi, γj] .

Sij =

(7.8)

where γi are the 2n × 2n (n = (d − 3)/2) Euclidean Dirac gamma matrices
in (d − 2) dimensions. The minrep and its unique deformations describe
the conformally massless scalar and spinor ﬁelds. They exhaust the list of
conformally masless ﬁelds for odd d[69]. The lowest energy irrep of the minrep
has the labels

while the unique spinorial deformation of the minrep has the lowest energy
irrep

, (0,· · · , 0, 1)Di

7.2 Deformations in even dimensions

The minrep of the conformal group in four dimensions admits a one parame-
ter family of deformations labelled by helicity[21]. For integer and half inte-
ger values of helicity the resulting unitary representations are isomorphic to
the doubleton representations that describe massless conformal ﬁelds of arbi-
trary spin in four dimensions that were constructed and studied in[24, 26, 25].
Similarly one ﬁnds that the minrep of SO(6, 2) admits a discrete inﬁnite fam-
ily of deformations[22, 23] that are isomorphic to doubleton representations
that describe higher spin massless conformal ﬁelds in six dimensions studied
earlier in [27, 71, 58].

21

In contrast to odd dimensions, the constraints on the spin terms that
describe the deformations of the minrep of SO(d, 2) for even d admit an inﬁ-
nite set of solutions that describe conformally massless ﬁelds. They exhaust
the list of conformally massless ﬁelds as a consequence of the fact that 7.4
is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a massless representation of the
Poincare group to be extendable to a unitary representation of the confor-
mal group[68, 69]. These deformations are all unitary lowest weight repre-
sentations of SO(d, 2) whose lowest energy irreps have the SO(2) × SO(d)
labels[64]

or

; (0,· · · , 0, s, 0)Di

where s is a non-negative integer. The spinorial generators Sij (i, j,· · · =
1, . . . , (d − 2) ) can always be realized in terms of fermionic oscillators[64].

8 Quasiconformal construction of higher spin

algebras

8.1 Bosonic AdS(d+1)/CF Td higher spin algebras

To construct the AdS(d + 1)/CF Td higher spin algebra , let us ﬁrst express
the so(d, 2) generators in the “canonical basis” MAB (A, B = 0, 1, . . . , d + 1)
in terms of the generators of the compact 3-grading

The AdS(d+1)/CF Td higher spin algebra is simply the quotient of the
universal enveloping algebra U (d, 2) of SO(d, 2) by its Joseph ideal J (d, 2)
[52, 46, 60, 72, 61, 62, 63]. We recall that the Joseph ideal of the universal en-
veloping algebra of a Lie algebra is a two-sided ideal that annihilates its min-
imal unitary representation. In fact , in the mathematics literature minrep is
deﬁned by this property. We shall denote the corresponding AdS(d+1)/CF Td
higher spin algebra as hs(d, 2):

hs(d, 2) =

U (d, 2)
J (d, 2)

less two-row Young tableaux representations of SO(d, 2):

algebra by the Joseph ideal does precisely this and the generators of the
resulting inﬁnite higher spin algebra transform under so(d, 2) as follows:

⊕

⊕ ... ⊕

⊕ . . .

(8.12)

For the minimal unitary realization of SO(d, 2) obtained via the quasicon-
formal method the generators JABCD of the Joseph ideal vanish identically as
operators. For d = 3, 4, 6 dimensions this was established in [61, 62]. These
results were extended to d = 5 in [63] and to general d > 6 in[64]. Hence the
enveloping algebra of the minrep of SO(d, 2) that results from quantization
of its geometric quasiconformal action yields directly the bosonic higher spin
AdS(d+1)/Confd algebra in all dimensions.

8.2 Deformations and supersymmetric extensions of

AdS(d+1)/CF Td higher spin algebras

The minimal unitary representation of SO(d, 2) and its deformations as ob-
tained via the quasiconformal approach are in one-to-one correspondence

24

with conformally massless ﬁelds in d-dimensional Minkowskian spacetimes.
Therefore one deﬁnes the deformations of the bosonic AdS(d+1)/CF Td higher
spin algebras as enveloping algebras of the deformed minimal unitary representations[61,
62, 63, 64]. These deformed higher spin algebras can be interpreted as quo-
tients of the universal enveloping algebra U (d, 2) of SO(d, 2) by a deformed
Joseph ideal JDef (d, 2):

hs(d, 2)Def =

U (d, 2)

JDef (d, 2)

(8.13)

The deformations of the Joseph ideal are best studied by decomposing the
generators JABCD of the Joseph ideal with respect to the Lorentz group
SO(d−1, 1) as was done in [61, 62, 63, 64]. Vanishing of the generators JABCD
as operators within quasiconformal realization of the minrep are equivalent
to the following Lorentz covariant conditions:

(d − 2)

2

d D · D + Mµν · Mµν +

P µ · Kµ = 0
P µ · (Mµν + ηµν D) = 0
Kµ · (Mµν − ηµν D) = 0
ηµν Mµρ · Mνσ − P(ρ · Kσ) + (d − 2) ηρσ = 0
Mµν · Mρσ + Mµσ · Mνρ + Mµρ · Mσν = 0
D · Mµν + P[µ · Kν] = 0
M[µν · Pρ] = 0
M[µν · Kρ] = 0

(8.14)

where symmetrizations (round brackets) and anti-symmetrizations (square
brackets) are of weight one.

Under deformation some of the generators of SO(d, 2) get modiﬁed by
spin dependent terms. More speciﬁcally only the ﬁrst three identities above
remain unchanged and the momentum and special conformal generators re-
main lightlike under deformations:
P 2 = P µPµ = 0

, K 2 = KµKµ = 0

(8.15)

The fourth identity above takes the form[64]

ηµνMµρ · Mνσ − P(ρ · Kσ) −(cid:20)

2

(d − 2)S 2 − (d − 2)(cid:21) ηρσ = 0

(8.16)

25

where S 2 is the Casimir operator of the little group SO(d − 2)S generated
by the spin terms Sij.
Physical interpretation of some of the deformed identities depends on the
space-time dimension. In four dimensions one ﬁnds that the identities that
depend on the deformation parameter ζ , which is twice the helicity, take the
form[61]

W µ =

V µ =

ǫµνρσMνρ · Pσ = ζP µ

and W µ and V µ are the Pauli-Lubansky vector and its special conformal ana-
log, respectively. The eigenvalues of the Casimir operators of the deformed
minreps of SO(4, 2) depend only on ζ[61]:

C2 = M A

(8.23)

(8.24)

Deformed Joseph ideal generators of 6d conformal group SO(6, 2) were
given in[62]. One ﬁnds that the analog of Pauli-Lubanski vector in 6d is a
tensor of rank 3 and its conformal analogue deﬁned as

Aµνρ =

1
3!

ǫµνρσδτ M [σδ · P τ ]

Bµνρ =

1
3!

ǫµνρσδτ M [σδ · K τ ]

They vanish identically for the minrep

Aµνρ = 0

Bµνρ = 0

26

(8.25)

(8.26)

For the deformed minreps they do not vanish, but satisfy self-duality and
anti-self-duality conditions:

where the dual rank three tensors are deﬁned as follows:

(8.27)

1
3!

ǫµνρσδτ Bσδτ

(8.28)

Aµνρ = eAµνρ
Bµνρ = −eBµνρ
eBµνρ =

1
3!

eAµνρ =

ǫµνρσδτ Aσδτ ,

Similarly one ﬁnds the following identity for the generators of the de-

formed minreps:

Mµν · Mρσ + Mµσ · Mνρ + Mµρ · Mσν = ǫ

µνρσ (P[δ · Kτ ] + Mδτ · ∆)

δτ

(8.29)

while each side of this equation vanishes separately for the true minrep.

The quadratic Casimir operator of the deformed minrep of SO∗(8)is given

by [22]:

(8.30)
where T 2 is the quadratic Casimir operator of an SU(2) subgroup of the little
group SO(4) of massless particles whose eigenvalues label the deformations.

C2 [so∗(8)]deformed = −8(cid:0)2 − T 2(cid:1)

In general the representation

that vanished in the symmetric tensor product of the adjoint representation
for the true minrep of SO(d, 2) no longer vanishes for the deformed minrep.
On the other hand the representation
that occurs in the tensor product
still vanishes for the deformed minreps:

ηCDMAC · MDB = 0

(8.31)

Hence the gauge ﬁelds of deformed higher spin theories deﬁned by hs(d, 2)Def
will not consist only of ﬁelds corresponding to traceless two-row Young
tableaux. Their Young tableaux will be those that occur in the symmetrized
products of the adjoint tableau

of SO(d, 2) subject to the constraint:

(cid:16)

⊗ (cid:17)Sym

8.3 Supersymmetric deformations of higher spin alge-

bras

Maximal dimension for the existence of simple superconformal algebras over
the ﬁeld of real or complex numbers is six[74]. In d = 3 the conformal group
SO(3, 2) admits supersymmetric extensions to supergroups OSp(N|4, R) with
even subgroups SO(N) × Sp(4, R). The minimal unitary supermultiplet of
OSp(N|4, R) for even N consists of a scalar singleton transforming in a chiral
spinor representation of SO(N) and a spinor singleton transforming in the
conjugate spinor representation of SO(N). For odd N the minimal unitary
supermultiplet contains a scalar and a spinor singleton both transforming in
the unique spinor representation of SO(N).

That the higher spin algebra of Fradkin and Vasiliev in AdS4 as well as its
supersymmetric extensions are given by the enveloping algebras of the sin-
gletonic realization of SO(3, 2) and its supersymmetric extensions was ﬁrst
pointed out in [52]. In higher dimensions AdS(d+1)/CF Td higher spin super-
algebras are deﬁned as enveloping algebras of the quasiconformal realization
of the minimal unitary representation of the correponding superconformal
algebras[61, 62, 63]. The minimal unitary supermultiplet contains the min-
rep of SO(d, 2) and certain deformations of the minrep. As such it corre-
sponds to a massless conformal supermultiplet of the underlying conformal
superalgebra.

In d = 4 the conformal algebra SU(2, 2) can be extended to an inﬁnite
family of superalgebras SU(2, 2| N) with the even subalgebra SU(2, 2) ⊕
U(N). The minimal unitary representation of SU(2, 2|N) and its deforma-
tions were constructed via the quasiconformal method in [21]. These rep-
resentations were later reformulated in terms of helicity deformed twistors
that transform non-linearly under the Lorentz group and the corresponding
AdS5/CF T4 higher spin superalgebras were studied in [61].

The conformal algebra SO(6, 2) = SO∗(8) in d = 6 also admits an inﬁ-
nite family of superconformal extensions OSp(8∗ | 2N) with even subalgebras
SO∗(8)⊕USp(2N). The quasiconformal construction of the minimal unitary
supermultiplets of OSp(8∗ | 2N) and their deformations were given in [22, 23].
These representaions were reformulated in terms of deformed twistors and the
corresponding AdS7/CF T6 higher spin superalgebras were studied in [62].

In ﬁve dimensions there exists a unique superconformal algebra , namely
the exceptional superalgebra with the even subalgebra SO(5, 2) ⊕ SU(2).
The minimal unitary supermultiplet of F (4) was constructed via the quasi-

28

conformal method and the unique higher spin AdS6/CF T5 superalgbera was
studied in [64].
