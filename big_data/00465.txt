ABSTRACT

We present a new technique for wide and shallow observations using the near-infrared channel
of Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Wide-ﬁeld near-IR surveys
with HST are generally ineﬃcient, as guide star acquisitions make it impractical to observe more
than one pointing per orbit. This limitation can be circumvented by guiding with gyros alone,
which is possible as long as the telescope has three functional gyros. The method presented here
allows us to observe mosaics of eight independent WFC3-IR pointings in a single orbit by utilizing
the fact that HST drifts by only a very small amount in the 25 seconds between non-destructive
reads of unguided exposures. By shifting the reads and treating them as independent exposures
the full resolution of WFC3 can be restored. We use this “drift and shift” (DASH) method in the
Cycle 23 COSMOS-DASH program, which will obtain 456 WFC3 H160 pointings in 57 orbits,
covering an area of 0.6 degree2 in the COSMOS ﬁeld down to H160 = 25. When completed, the
program will more than triple the area of extra-galactic survey ﬁelds covered by near-IR imaging
at HST resolution. We demonstrate the viability of the method with the ﬁrst four orbits (32
pointings) of this program. We show that the resolution of the WFC3 camera is preserved, and
that structural parameters of galaxies are consistent with those measured in guided observations.

Introduction

Over its lifetime the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) has imaged many “blank” ﬁelds at many
wavelengths, to obtain a census of the Universe
over most of its history. The survey strategy of
the extra-galactic community has been to image
a few individual HST pointings to great depth
(examples are the Hubble Deep Fields, the Ultra

Deep Field, and the Frontier Fields; Williams et
al. 1996; Ellis et al. 2013; Illingworth et al. 2013;
Lotz et al. 2014), and larger areas to shallower
depth (the GEMS survey, COSMOS, the GOODS
North and South ﬁelds, CANDELS, etc.; Rix et
al. 2004; Scoville et al. 2007; Giavalisco et al. 2004;
Grogin et al. 2011; Koekemoer et al. 2011). This
“wedding cake” strategy of tiered surveys is driven
by the form of the luminosity function of most as-
tronomical objects. The number density of faint
objects is almost always larger than that of bright
objects, which means that representative samples
of faint objects can be obtained in deep, pencil-
beam surveys and representative samples of bright
objects in shallow, wide-area surveys.

Ground-based surveys have extended the shal-
low, wide-area domain to degree-scales and be-
yond: SDSS covers ∼ 1/3 of the entire sky in the
optical, and a plethora of optical and near-IR sur-

1

veys are covering areas up to thousands of square
degrees (e.g., the 155 degree2 CFHTLenS survey,
the ESO Kilo Degree Survey, and the 5000 degree2
Dark Energy Survey in the optical, and the tiered
UKIDSS near-IR surveys: the 12 degree2 VIDEO
survey, and the deep 1 degree2 UltraVISTA sur-
vey in the near-IR; Erben et al. 2013; Arnaboldi
et al. 2007; de Jong et al. 2013; Abbott et al. 2005;
Jarvis et al. 2013; McCracken et al. 2012). These
surveys measure the high mass end of the galaxy
mass function at 0 < z < 4 and also address ques-
tions such as the number density of bright Lyman
break galaxies out to z ∼ 8, the clustering of galax-
ies, the evolution of galaxy groups and clusters,
the properties and demographics of AGNs, and
the prevalence of short-lived events such as merg-
ers.

Many of these science questions would beneﬁt
greatly from imaging at HST resolution. How-
ever, the widest/shallowest tiers of the wedding
cake are devoid of HST imaging, particularly in
the near-IR. The largest area imaged with HST in
the optical is the 2 degree2 COSMOS ﬁeld, which
was carried out with ACS in the I814 ﬁlter in Cy-
cles 12 and 13 (Scoville et al. 2007) at a cost of
640 orbits. By contrast, the widest area imaged
in the near-IR is an order of magnitude smaller.
The ﬁve ﬁelds of the 900-orbit CANDELS survey,
which used the J125 and H160 ﬁlters of the WFC3
camera in a Multi-Cycle Treasury program in Cy-
cles 18, 19, and 20, add up to 0.25 degree2.

The reason for the lack of very wide HST near-
IR surveys seems obvious: the price of HST’s ex-
cellent resolution and small pixels is a small ﬁeld
of view, and a single WFC3 pointing covers a mere
4.6 arcmin2. However, this explanation is not suf-
ﬁcient, as ground based surveys routinely cover
thousands of times their detector area. As an ex-
ample, the UKIDSS Large Area Survey (LAS) cov-
ers 4000 degree2 in Y , J, H, and K using ∼ 20, 000
pointings with the 0.21 degree2 WFCAM instru-
ment. An HST/WFC3 survey with a similar strat-
egy (that is, a similar number of pointings) would
cover 25 degree2. Furthermore, as the sensitiv-
ity of WFC3 is similar to that of a 30 m telescope
on the ground, even short exposures reach depths
comparable to the deepest ground-based surveys
in existence: a 300 s exposure in H160 gives a 5σ
point source sensitivity of AB = 25.4, comparable
to the deepest ground-based surveys in existence.

The real limitation when designing wide-ﬁeld
programs is that HST has a natural lower limit to
the exposure time per pointing, which stems from
the time that is required for a guide star acquisi-
tion and other overheads associated with moving
the telescope. The UKIDSS Large Area Survey
has an exposure time of 40 s per band, and this
would be hopelessly ineﬃcient with HST: even if
many guide star acquisitions were allowed in a sin-
gle orbit (the limit is two), only four would ﬁt and
nearly the entire ∼ 50 minutes of orbital visibility
would be taken up with overhead. As a result,
the natural lower limit to the exposure time is a
single orbit,7 and the natural upper limit to the
area of an HST survey is the number of orbits of
the program multiplied by the detector area of the
instrument.

2. “Drift and Shift”: A New Method for

Wide-Field WFC3 Surveys

2.1. Overview

There is a way to circumvent the limitations
imposed by the guide star acquisitions. If no new
guide star is acquired between pointings the over-
heads decrease dramatically, and as we show below
it is possible to ﬁt eight distinct pointings, each
with an exposure time of ∼ 300 s, in a single orbit.
Operating without a guide star does not change
the telescope control: ever since the last servicing
mission the pointing of HST has been controlled
by three gyros, and this is the case irrespective of
whether a guide star is acquired or not. In a stan-
dard guided exposure the three gyros receive con-
tinuous corrections from the Fine Guidance Sen-
sors (FGS), and turning oﬀ guiding merely stops
the stream of corrections from the FGS. The ef-
fect of the lack of corrections is that the telescope
begins to drift by an expected 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)001 – 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)002 per
second. The drift can be larger during orbits when
the telescope experiences unusually strong atmo-
spheric drag.8

The result of operating in a gyro-only mode is

7Note that it is possible to split the orbit into shorter ob-
servations with diﬀerent ﬁlters; this reduces the per-ﬁlter
observing time but does not increase the area of the survey.
8This is an expectation; there are no systematic measure-
ments of this eﬀect because all observations (with the ex-
ception of spatial scans for bright objects) are done under
FGS control.

smeared due to the lack of ﬁne guidance sensor corrections. The middle panels show the twelve individual samples
that comprise the exposure, created from the non-destructive reads. The smearing is small in each individual sample.
The bottom panels show the reconstructed image after shifting the twelve samples to a common frame and adding
them.

that are available for cosmic ray rejection, and
begin to show appreciable drift within each sam-
ple. However, for other scientiﬁc applications such
longer intervals may be more advantageous.

Next we determine how many independent
pointings we can ﬁt in a single orbit, by varying
the number of samples taken during a single ex-
posure (i.e., the per-pointing exposure time) and
the number of pointings. This calculation depends
on the ﬁeld that is observed, as that determines
the length of the visibility window. We only con-
sider the COSMOS ﬁeld (at RA=2h15m00s and
Dec=10◦00(cid:48)00”), which is the target area of our
GO-14144 program (see §3) and is typical for most
of the sky.11 The maximum number of pointings
is eight: when a larger number is attempted (with
a smaller number of samples taken during each
exposure), buﬀer dumps cause the ninth pointing
to spill over into a second orbit. The structure of
the orbit is summarized in Table 2.1 and shown
graphically in the left panel of Figure 2. The
pointing pattern for this particular orbit (Visit 1
of GO-14144) is shown at right in Figure 2: the
total covered area is ∼ 8× greater than that of a
single WFC3 pointing.

The exposure time per pointing is approxi-
mately the exposure time per sample multiplied
by the number of samples. The number of sam-
ples is 11 (NSAMP=11) for the ﬁrst four pointings
and 12 (NSAMP=12) for the last four, however the
ﬁrst sample is read out at the very beginning of
the exposure (at 2.9 seconds). The realized per-
pointing exposure times are 253 s and 278 s re-
spectively. The total number of independent 25-
second observations obtained in this single orbit
is 4 × 10 + 4 × 11 = 84. The observing eﬃciency,
expressed as the on-target realized exposure time
divided by the total orbital visibility, is 66 %, sim-
ilar to the typical eﬃciency of standard observing
modes.

11It is possible to ﬁt more pointings in continuous viewing
zone observations, at the expense of an increased back-
ground in some of the pointings and possibly larger drift
rates.

therefore that exposures longer than a minute are
smeared. For CCD detectors, such images are sci-
entiﬁcally unusable. When a guide star acquisition
fails, or a guide star is lost during an observation,
the visit is ﬂagged and typically such observations
are repeated. However, a property of the WFC3
detector (and IR detectors in general) is that an
exposure is composed of multiple non-destructive,
zero-overhead reads. The exposure time of an in-
dividual read can be set,9 and for times up to 25 s
the drift in between reads is (cid:46) 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)05, or less than
half a 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)13 pixel. The dataset obtained in the
interval between two reads is simply the diﬀer-
ence between read i and read i − 1. Therefore,
an unguided, gyro-controlled, 300 s exposure with
25 s reads eﬀectively consists of 12 independent,
dithered exposures that can be shifted and com-
bined into a full resolution image with hot pixels
and cosmic rays removed. A schematic of this pro-
cedure is shown in Figure 1.

After the 300 s exposure the telescope can then
be oﬀset to a new position without the need to
acquire a guide star at that position; as soon as the
telescope move is completed the next integration
can begin. As we detail below, we can observe
eight distinct positions in a single orbit with this
method.

2.2.

Implementation: Structure of a Sin-
gle Orbit

The optimal way to implement the “drift and
shift” strategy is dictated by the amount of data
that can be stored in memory during the exposure.
We ﬁrst consider the minimum time between reads
during an exposure.10 With 10 s intervals between
reads (SPARS10 mode) the buﬀer ﬁlls so quickly
that memory dumps have to be conducted during
the exposure, drastically reducing the observing
eﬃciency and negating the beneﬁts of the method.
Fortunately, 25 s intervals (SPARS25 mode) are
possible, and the typical drift in that time is still
signiﬁcantly smaller than a pixel. For our pur-
poses, longer intervals do not provide signiﬁcant
beneﬁts in terms of the total on-target exposure

9To certain speciﬁed values; e.g., 10 s, 25 s, 50 s, 100 s, and
200 s.

10We used the Astronomer’s Proposal Tool Phase II soft-
ware (http://www.stsci.edu/hst/proposing/apt) for this
analysis, and implemented this strategy in our GO-14144
program described in §3.

they coincide with bright sources that would cause persistence problems.

Field – COSMOS-DASH

We have undertaken a survey with the drift-
and-shift technique during Cycle 23, adding a
wide-ﬁeld tier to the “wedding cake” of near-IR
imaging surveys with HST. Covering 0.6 degree2,
COSMOS-DASH (for “Drift And SHift”) more
than triples the extragalactic survey area that
HST has observed in the near-IR. Here we de-
scribe the observing strategy of this program (GO-
in § 4 we analyze the ﬁrst four visits
14114);
and demonstrate that the drift-and-shift technique
produces the expected results.

The 57-orbit COSMOS-DASH program is tar-
geting the COSMOS ﬁeld (Scoville et al. 2007),
as this is the only ﬁeld with optical ACS imaging
(in the I814 ﬁlter) over a suﬃciently large contigu-
ous area. The longest wavelength ﬁlter, H160, is
used to maximize the color baseline at HST res-
olution. We do not cover the entire 2 degree2
that has ACS imaging but only the UltraVISTA
deep stripes (McCracken et al. 2012); these regions
have extremely deep complementary ground-based
Y , J, H, and K imaging as well as deep Spitzer
IRAC imaging from the SMUVS Exploration Sci-
ence program (Spitzer GO-11016, PI: K. Caputi).
The layout of the 57 × 8 = 456 pointings is
shown in Figure 3. The data are taken at two ori-
entations to facilitate scheduling. The large gap in
the mosaic in the central stripe is the area of the
COSMOS ﬁeld that was observed in J125 and H160
in the CANDELS Multi-Cycle program (Grogin et
al. 2011; Koekemoer et al. 2011). We ensured that
some pointings partially overlap with CANDELS
in order to test our ability to recover the photom-
etry and structural parameters of galaxies (see §
4). Small gaps in the mosaic are deliberate, and
coincide with very bright stars or galaxies. Those
objects would cause severe persistence, with the
potential to aﬀect the other pointings in an or-
bit as well as consecutive orbits. The total area
covered by GO-14114 is 0.59 degree2, which can
be compared to the existing total ﬁve-ﬁeld CAN-
DELS area of 0.24 degree2. GO-14114 therefore
increases the survey area that has WFC3 imaging
in addition to deep ground- and Spitzer data by a
factor of 3.5.

The depth that will be achieved depends on the

ing is (cid:46) 1 pixel the limiting magnitudes will be
identical to those of regular 253 s and 278 s expo-
sures. With the average zodaical background in
the COSMOS ﬁeld the 5σ point source limit will
then be H160 = 25.1 (on the AB system). If the
drift rate is several pixels the point source depth
will be slightly lower, as the shifts place diﬀerent
independent pixels onto the same output pixel; a
conservative expectation is H160 ≈ 24.9 in those
circumstances. As we show in the next Section the
drifts in the ﬁrst four orbits of our program are of
order 1 pixel per pointing.

Figure 4 places COSMOS-DASH in the context
of other WFC3 HF 160W observations, in terms of
their depth and covered area. We probe a regime
that was previously unexplored with space-based
IR imaging, despite the fact that the orbit-total
of GO-14114 is an order of magnitude smaller in
terms of time allocation compared to, for example,
COSMOS and CANDELS.

Fig. 4.— Area vs. depth for WFC3/IR F160W imaging.
The technique described in this paper as implemented in
GO-14114 (red point) allows us to add a wide shallow tier
to infrared surveys with HST. Furthermore, the orbit total
of GO-14114 (57) is an order of magnitude smaller than
that of the other surveys shown in this Figure.

4. Early Data

We observed four orbits of GO-14114 on UT
2015 October 15 and 16. The decision to obtain
these data was a trade-oﬀ: these early data allow

they come at a price. The COSMOS ﬁeld has a
strongly variable near-IR background throughout
the year, as there is a relatively large amount of
zodaical dust in its direction. The background in
October is so high that the depth of the data is
compromised; as we detail below these four orbits
are ∼ 0.6 magnitudes shallower than the rest of the
survey will be, when taken at lower background
levels. The four orbits (32 pointings) cover the
top area of the middle ULTRAVISTA deep stripe,
North of the CANDELS ﬁeld.

4.1. Reduction and Analysis

We downloaded the raw and calibrated im-
ages from the Mikulski Archive for Space Tele-
scopes (MAST12). The images were processed on
the ﬂy with the best available calibration by the
calwfc3 pipeline.
In our reductions we make
use of both the ﬂat-ﬁelded ﬁnal pipeline outputs
(FLT) and the calibrated intermediate MultiAc-
cum exposures (IMA). Each orbit consists of one
guided and seven unguided pointings. These two
types of pointings are processed through similar
steps, but we note the diﬀerences where necessary.
We ﬁrst carry out a basic reduction of the FLT,
similar to that described in Skelton et al. (2014).
We mask all sources in the image and subtract
a second order polynomial ﬁt to the background.
We then align the image to an external reference
world coordinate system using the tweakreg task.
We use the IF 814W images13 and catalogs pro-
vided by the COSMOS collaboration as a reference
(Koekemoer et al. 2007; Massey et al. 2010). As in
Skelton et al. (2014), we use all sources in the im-
age for alignment, not only stars. Even though the
FLT images are slightly smeared, we prefer to use
them for this rough alignment because the sources
have higher signal to noise. A ﬁne alignment step
is performed later in the reduction. The aligned
FLTs are drizzled together to create a preliminary
mosaic for the orbit. We run SExtractor (Bertin
& Arnouts 1996) on this mosaic to create a seg-
mentation map which is used as a mask of sources
in later steps of the reduction.

The tweakreg task provides the oﬀsets of each

8

of the 8 exposures from the commanded pointing
position. Generally, the relative pointing accuracy
of HST is very high, and the RMS precision of oﬀ-
sets within an orbit is ∼ 2 to 5 milli-arcsec with
ﬁne lock on two guide stars and when the oﬀsets
are small (Gonzaga et al. 2012). In the absence
of guide stars, we ﬁnd that the unguided expo-
sures show larger relative pointing errors, as large
as 8(cid:48)(cid:48). The left panel of Figure 5 shows the oﬀ-
sets from the commanded position as a function
of time since the start of the orbit. The oﬀsets in-
crease monotonically with time as can be expected
from the build-up of uncompensated forces on the
spacecraft during the orbit. Furthermore, sudden
jumps in pointing accuracy of ∼ 4(cid:48)(cid:48) can be seen
for the last position in COSMOS-15, 16 and 17.
In orbit COSMOS-18 the jump happens after the
fourth position. The cause for these larger oﬀsets
is not yet understood. The oﬀsets are small rel-
ative to the instrument FOV (10% of the WFC3
FOV); however users should make sure that there
is suﬃcient overlap between pointings to compen-
sate for this eﬀect if a contiguous mosaic is needed.
Next, we proceed to reconstruct unsmeared im-
ages from the non-destructive reads. These reads
are preserved in the IMA images: these are multi-
extension ﬁles which contain all the individual
reads from the original exposure. Each read has
been bias-, overscan- and dark-current-subtracted
as well as ﬂat-ﬁelded. The up-the-ramp ﬁts have
also been carried out, ﬂagging cosmic rays. The
IMA images are in units of electrons per second.
For each read i, starting with the second, we sub-
tract the preceding read, i − 1. These diﬀerence
images are treated as the science arrays in our
analysis. We construct an error array based on
the read noise, Poisson noise and ﬂat ﬁeld uncer-
tainties. The data quality (DQ) array is taken
directly from the IMA. These three arrays (sci-
ence, error, DQ) are paired with the header from
the aligned FLT image and saved as a new ﬁle. In
this manner, each pointing is split into 10 or 11
new 25-second images, depending on the number
of reads. Below we refer to the set of 10 or 11 such
images produced from a single original image as a
“sequence”. Guided and unguided exposures are
treated in the same manner.

We mask all sources (using the masks created
from the FLT ﬁles) and perform a median back-
ground subtraction for each of these new images.

Fig. 5.— Left: Oﬀsets relative to the commanded position as a function of time for the eight exposures in each of the four
observed orbits. The increase with time is expected, however the source of the large oﬀsets at the end of the orbit (and halfway
through COSMOS-18) is not yet understood. Right: Drift rate during the pointing in pixels per 25 seconds as a function of
time. Following the ﬁrst guided pointing (no drift), the drift rate increases with time.

As noted above, the zodaical background in the
data is very high, at ≈ 2.2 e−/s. Typical val-
ues of the background in the CANDELS obser-
vations of the COSMOS ﬁeld range from 0.6 e−/s
to 0.8 e−/s. For background levels below 0.9 e−/s,
a 250 second exposure would be read-noise limited
(RN ∼ 15 e−), however, the current observations
are background-limited.

The treatment of cosmic rays deserves careful
attention. Cosmic rays are ﬂagged by the up-the-
ramp ﬁts of the calwfc3 pipeline. However, there
are two issues with this procedure. First, due to
the telescope drifts, objects move across the detec-
tor during the exposure. This change in ﬂux from
one read to the next causes the up-the-ramp ﬁts
to ﬂag the varying pixels as cosmic rays. This is-
sue primarily aﬀects point sources, where the size
of the source is commensurate with the drift dur-
ing the exposure. To remedy this, we reset all
cosmic ray ﬂags within the boundaries of objects
(as identiﬁed by the segmentation map). This has
the obvious negative eﬀect of resetting the ﬂags
for cosmic rays that fall on top of objects. The
second issue is that cosmic rays which occur be-
tween the zeroth read (at 2.9 seconds) and the
ﬁrst read (at 27.9 seconds) cannot be identiﬁed by

the ramp ﬁts. While the ﬁrst issue aﬀects only
unguided pointings, the second aﬀects all point-
ings. In order to identify those cosmic rays, and
also to ﬂag any cosmic rays which were erroneously
reset in the previous step, we use a combination
of L.A. Cosmic (van Dokkum 2001) (run on the
FLTs) and astrodrizzle (run when combining
the individual reads; Gonzaga et al. 2012). The
4096 ﬂag is added to the DQ array for all pix-
els identiﬁed by both methods. We visually veri-
ﬁed that our adopted procedure correctly identiﬁes
nearly all cosmic rays and leaves the central pixels
of compact objects intact.

The images in all non-guided sequences are
aligned to the COSMOS IF 814W mosaic. The
alignment is performed with the tweakreg task
in astrodrizzle (Gonzaga et al. 2012). Again,
we use all sources within the image to calculate
the oﬀsets. Here we only solve for x and y shifts
and do not ﬁt for rotation or change in scale. The
typical rms in the diﬀerences of matched positions
is ∼ 0.4 native pixels, identical to that achieved
when aligning the much deeper CANDELS COS-
MOS images (Skelton et al. 2014). For each se-
quence we calculate the oﬀset between the ﬁrst
and the last read to determine the mean rate of

drift. In the right panel of Figure 5 we show the
drift rate as a function of time for each of the four
orbits. The drift rate increases with time, as ex-
pected, but stays within 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)002 per second, or 0.42
pixels per 25 seconds. In Figure 6 we show the dis-
tribution of drift rates for all unguided sequences
(solid red line) compared to archival WFC3 IR
observations that were taken in gyro-only control
(dotted black line). The mean drift rate in our ob-
servations is 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)001 per second or 0.2 pixels per 25
seconds, smaller than that of the archival observa-
tions. It should be noted that in the archival data
the switch to gyro-control was not deliberate, but
the result of the failure to acquire (or the loss of) a
guide star. Our data suggest that when the switch
to gyro control is done deliberately, the drift rates
are very small and within the expected range.

Final mosaics are produced with astrodrizzle
using all sequence images. We use exposure time
weighting, a square kernel and pixf rac = 0.8.
We drizzle the images to a pixel scale of 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48).
The ﬁnal mosaic of the current observations is
9100×10200 pixels, centered at RA=10 : 00 : 25.4,
DEC=+2 : 34 : 51.2. In Figure 7 we show the full
mosaic. We also show a zoomed-in cut-out (top

on engineering predictions is up to 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)002 per second (gray

age. The example shown is from the eighth point-
ing of COSMOS-15, i.e., one of the pointings with
the largest drift rate (Figure 5). Another set of
cut-outs (bottom right) compare our mosaic to
that from the CANDELS observations. The mo-
saic is of high quality, with no obvious problems
or defects:
it looks like a shallow version of the
CANDELS imaging, as intended. In the following
subsections we characterize the data quality.

4.2. Point Spread Function

In order to assess the quality of the recon-
structed data, we ﬁrst turn to the point spread
function (PSF). A key question is whether the fact
that the exposures were unguided has led to a net
broadening of the PSF compared to guided expo-
sures.

We construct the PSF directly from the HF 160W

mosaic using stars in the image. We run SExtractor
on the ﬁnal mosaic to detect objects and perform
photometry. Fluxes are measured in a series of
apertures with diﬀerent radii. In the left panel of
Figure 8 we show the SExtractor FLUX RADIUS
(the radius of the circle centered on the barycen-
ter that encloses about half of the total ﬂux) vs.
MAG AUTO (a total magnitude measurement).
Point sources follow a tight sequence with small
sizes at all magnitudes and match well the stel-
lar sequence in the CANDELS COSMOS catalog
of Skelton et al. (2014, gray points). Points that
scatter above the stellar sequence at bright mag-
nitudes are saturated stars. In the right panel of
Figure 8 we show the ratio of the ﬂux in a large
aperture (2.(cid:48)(cid:48)0) to that in a small aperture (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5)
as a function of magnitude which shows a similar
tight sequence, which also matches the CANDELS
COSMOS catalog of Skelton et al. (2014). The
median FWHM of the stars in these sequences is
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)21 (2.1 pixels) compared to 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)19 (3.2 pixels at
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)06/pix) from the CANDELS COSMOS mosaic
(Skelton et al. 2014), which is fully guided, indicat-
ing that we are recovering the original resolution.
The sequences in both panels of Figure 8 are use-
ful diagnostics of the image quality such that large
spreads or oﬀsets in the stellar sequences can in-
dicate problems with alignment or clipping of the
cores of stars.

For a quantitative comparison, we follow the
PSF construction method of Skelton et al. (2014).

Stars are selected based the stellar sequence in
the right panel of Figure 8 such that the ratio
between the ﬂuxes is 1.1 < f (2.(cid:48)(cid:48)0)/f (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5) < 1.2
(red points). We visually inspect all selected stars
and exclude 21 objects which are either too close
to the edge of the mosaic or have close neighbors.
Despite our eﬀort, some stars still have suppressed
weight at the center of their weight maps. We ex-
clude 39 such stars, leaving a ﬁnal sample of 106
objects with HF 160W < 22. Stars are distributed
evenly across the ﬁeld and, since only 4 of the 32
pointings are guided, the ﬁnal PSF will be domi-
nated by the unguided exposures. We mask neigh-
boring objects within a postage stamp cut-out of
84 pixels around each star. The postage stamps
are recentered, normalized and then averaged to
determine the PSF and the PSF weight map (Fig-
ure 9).

Fig. 9.— Point spread function (PSF, left) constructed
from stars within the COSMOS-DASH mosaic and the cor-
responding combined weight map (right). Both the PSF
and the weight map have been normalized by the peak
value. The selection of stars is shown in Figure 8. 106
stars with HF 160W < 22 were used to create the PSF.

The curve of growth, which is the fraction of
enclosed light as a function of aperture size (nor-
malized at 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)0), is shown in the top panel of Figure
10 (solid line). For comparison, we also show the
HF 160W PSF derived from the CANDELS COS-
MOS observations (Skelton et al. 2014). The two
growth curves show excellent overall consistency.
A quantitative measure of the consistency is the
ratio between the two curves, which is shown in
the bottom panel of Figure 10. The COSMOS-
DASH PSF has ∼ 15% less energy in the central
pixel (for a pixel scale of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 per pixel), however
within the typical aperture used for photometry,
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)35 (solid vertical line), and out to 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)0 the dif-

12

0.00.0050.010.0150.70.80.91.0ferences between the two PSFs are (cid:46) 1%. This
demonstrates that by aligning the individual reads
we have recovered the resolution of guided HST
images.

4.3. Noise Characteristics

Here we analyze the noise characteristics of
the reconstructed images. As a comparison sam-
ple we obtained from MAST all other observa-
tions of extragalactic ﬁelds carried out with the
SPARS25 sampling mode and matching the expo-
sure times of our observations. In total we ﬁnd a
total of 39 public datasets, containing 107 expo-
sures (FLTs) that match these criteria. We pro-
cess these datasets in a manner identical to the
COSMOS-DASH observations: we split them into
individual reads and drizzle those to a ﬁnal distor-
tion corrected image (no alignment is necessary).
In this analysis we use the native pixel scale of
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)12 per pixel.

For each dataset we measure the pixel-to-pixel
noise in the original FLTs and in the ﬁnal driz-
zled image, masking sources and clipping the im-
age edges. In the top left panel of Figure 11 we
compare the noise in the FLTs to the drizzled im-
ages. As expected the scatter is lower in the driz-
zled images: drizzling artiﬁcially suppresses the
noise in the images as a result of the rebinning
of ﬂux (Fruchter, Sosey, et al. 2009, §3.3.1). The
COSMOS-DASH observations (red symbols) have
higher noise overall as a result of the elevated back-
ground levels (see §4.1). The four guided pointings
(red open symbols) follow the trend of the com-
parison sample (broken line): they behave in the
same way as other guided data, except with higher
noise due to the increased background. The dif-
ference is broadly consistent with the diﬀerence in
the background level: the zodaical background is
a factor of ∼ 3 higher than for typical exposures,
3 higher noise.
which translates into a factor of
However, the drizzled unguided pointings (ﬁlled
red symbols) exhibit higher noise than the driz-
zled guided images. On average, the noise in the
unguided pointings is 15% higher than in the un-
guided ones (and up to 28% higher). This corre-
sponds to a loss in depth of 0.15 ( and up to 0.27)
magnitudes. The reason for this behavior is that,
as a result of the shifts within each pointing, a
larger number of independent pixels contribute to
a single drizzled output pixel.

that one is interested in individual pixels; typical
aperture photometry is performed over scales of
several pixels, to match the size of the PSF or to
match the size of spatially-extended objects. As
an example, the aperture used in the Skelton et
al. (2014) catalogs has a diameter of 0.7(cid:48)(cid:48). To as-
sess the noise increase on larger scales we rebinned
the FLT and DRZ images to coarser grids and re-
measured the pixel-to-pixel variation. In the 2× 2
binned images (Figure 11, second panel), the noise
in the unguided exposures is on average 5% higher
than that in the unguided exposures. In the 3 × 3
and 5 × 5 binned images the noise is only ∼ 3%
higher. We conclude that, in “real world” applica-
tions, the loss in depth due to our method is only
∼ 0.03 − 0.07 magnitudes.

Finally, we stress that for these particular or-
bits the depth is limited by the high zodaical back-
ground, which results from our decision to sched-
ule them early in the Cycle. A full analysis of the
depth of the COSMOS-DASH data, including a
completeness analysis, will be performed when all
data are taken in Fall 2016.

Figure 12 compares the structural parameters
measured in COSMOS-DASH to those measured
in CANDELS. Overall there is excellent agree-
ment. The total magnitudes are oﬀset by 0.05,
with very small scatter. The median oﬀset in
axis ratios is 0.004, again with almost no scat-
ter (σ ∼ 0.02). There is a small systematic oﬀset
in sizes, which correlates with a small systematic
oﬀset in Sersic indices. This oﬀset is negligible
for galaxies with low Sersic indices and/or small
sizes. The median size diﬀerence for all objects is
0.04 dex or 10%, with objects in COSMOS-DASH
larger than in CANDELS, and the scatter is 0.05
dex. It is not clear whether this small diﬀerence
is caused by a small remaining error in our PSF,
issues with the background subtraction, or other
eﬀects. There is also the (perhaps unlikely) possi-
bility that CANDELS slightly underestimates the
sizes. Further analysis of these eﬀects is limited by
the high background in these four orbits and the
small number of stars that are suitable for PSF
reconstruction; we expect to explore this further
when the program is completed. Based on the
data we have in hand, we conclude that sizes can
be estimated with an accuracy of ∼ 10 %.

4.4. Galaxy Structural Parameters

5. Conclusions

A small section of the mosaic of 32 pointings
overlaps with existing H160 data from the CAN-
DELS survey. We measure structural parameters
of objects in this overlap region from our mosaic,
and compare them to measurements of the same
objects in CANDELS by van der Wel et al. (2012).
The same methodology is used here, and we re-
fer to van der Wel et al. (2014) for the details.
Brieﬂy, GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002) is used to ﬁt
Sersic proﬁles (Sersic 1968) to the images, using
the GALAPAGOS wrapper (Barden et al. 2012).
The local background is not a free parameter in
the ﬁt, but determined in an initial step.

For the comparison we selected objects brighter
than HF 160W = 22 and excluded objects with
use phot = 0 which removes edge objects and
stars (Skelton et al. 2014). We further excluded
galaxies with uncertain GALFIT ﬁts (f ≥ 2) in
either catalog, corresponding to bad ﬁts and no
ﬁts. The two catalogs are crossmatched based on
position with a tolerance of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5. No attempt is
made to match the segmentation maps. The ﬁnal
sample consists of 48 objects.

In this paper we show that HST can obtain
wide-ﬁeld near-IR data in a relatively small num-
ber of orbits. The “drift and shift” (DASH)
technique that makes this possible is well under-
stood, and has now been demonstrated to pro-
duce science-grade data at the full resolution of
the WFC3 camera. The low near-IR background
from space means that such wide-ﬁeld surveys
reach depths that are competitive with the deepest
ground-based surveys, despite the short ∼ 300 s
per-pointing integration times.

Our medium-sized, 57-orbit Cycle 23 program
covers an area more typically associated with a
Treasury survey. Were our technique applied in
an actual Treasury program, one could cover an
area of ﬁve square degrees in approximately 500
orbits. This opens up regimes previously regarded
as out of Hubble’s reach, both for “blank” extra-
galactic surveys and for speciﬁc targets such as
M31 and the Magellanic Clouds.
