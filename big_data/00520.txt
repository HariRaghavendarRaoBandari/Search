1 Introduction

The Yang-Mills ﬂow is the ﬂow of a natural vector ﬁeld on the space of con-
nections on a Riemannian n-manifold Z. The critical dimension for the ﬂow is

1

n = 4, and this is the dimension we consider here. In the closed case (com-
pact with no boundary), this 4-dimensional ﬂow has been studied extensively
by many authors [22, 2, 5, 26, 16, 24, 23, 25, 4, 28, 11]. Here we study the case
where Z has cylindrical ends. Our main results establish short- and long-time
existence and uniqueness results under certain hypotheses.

Throughout this paper, Z will be a cylindrical end 4-manifold that is ori-

ented and connected. In particular, this means we can write

Z = Z0 ∪Y ([0, ∞) × Y) ,

where Y is a closed 3-manifold, and Z0 is a compact manifold with ∂Z0 = Y.
We allow the case where Y has multiple connected components. To simplify the
exposition, we assume that Y is non-empty, though the results have extensions
to the case where Z is closed. We will use the term (cylindrical) ends to refer
to [0, ∞) × Y; though at times we will abuse terminology and refer to Y as the
‘ends’ as well. We assume Z is equipped with a cylindrical end metric g. This
means that g restricts on the ends to have the form

g|[0,∞)×Y = ds2 + gY,

where s is the coordinate-variable on [0, ∞), and gY is a ﬁxed metric on Y.

Let G be a compact, connected Lie group, and ﬁx a principal G-bundle P →

Z. We assume that P restricts on the cylindrical ends to be a product

P|[0,∞)×Y = [0, ∞) × Q,

for some bundle Q → Y. Every bundle on Z is equivalent to a bundle of this
form.

To obtain a good analytic problem, we want to consider only those connec-
tions on P that have ﬁxed asymptotics down the cylindrical ends of Z. For this
purpose, ﬁx a ﬂat connection a on Q. We assume this is acyclic, meaning that
a is irreducible and is non-degenerate as a critical point of the Chern-Simons
functional; see Section 2.1.1. Let

A(P; a)

denote the set of smooth connections on P that, together with their deriva-
tives, decay rapidly down the cylindrical end to the ﬁxed connection a. We
will write Ak,p(P; a) for the completion of A(P; a) relative to the Wk,p-Sobolev
norm, where the derivatives are deﬁned relative to any element of A(P; a).

Given an initial connection A0 in (a Sobolev completion of) A(P; a), the

Yang-Mills ﬂow is given by

∂τ A = −d∗

A FA,

A(0) = A0,

(1)

where A = A(τ) is a path of connections in (a Sobolev completion of) A(P; a).
Our main results pertain to this ﬂow, and are summarized here. See Sections
3.1 and 4 for precise statements.

2

• Short-time existence and uniqueness: Assume a is acyclic and

A0 ∈ A1,2(P; a) ∩ A2,p(P; a)

for some p > 4. We show that there is some τ0 > 0 so that a strong solution
to (1) exists, and is unique on the time interval [0, τ0). As is familiar in the
closed case, we obtain a characterization of the maximal existence time in terms
of concentration of the curvature. The only difference in the cylindrical end
setting is that these concentration points may escape to inﬁnity down the end.
In our approach to short-time existence, we primarily refer to Feehan’s re-
cent monograph [11] that summarizes and expands upon the original short-
time existence proofs by Struwe [26] and Kozono-Maeda-Naito [16]. The main
point we emphasize below is that, due to the acyclic assumption on a, there is
no essential analytic difference in passing from the closed case to the cylindri-
cal end case considered here. This effectively comes down to the observation
that the Sobolev embedding W1,2(Z) ֒→ L4(Z) holds even for non-compact
4-manifolds.

• Long-time existence: We give a proof of long-time existence under the fol-

lowing additional assumptions:

(i) There is a natural index associated to the ﬂat connection a, and we as-

sume this index is not too high.

(ii) We assume all ASD connections are ASD-regular. This term means that
the moduli space of ASD connections is cut out transversely, and hence
is smooth and of the expected dimension; see Section 2.2.2.

Under these assumptions, we prove that the Yang-Mills functional has a posi-
tive minimal energy gap η > 0; see Section 4.1. Then we prove that the ﬂow
(1) exists for all time provided the L2-norm of F+
is less than η. Our proof
A0
of this positive energy gap is a bubble-excluding analysis, relying on an un-
derstanding of singularities that can form along the ﬂow. Moreover, the above
assumptions also exclude bubbling at inﬁnite time.

• Inﬁnite-time convergence: Let A(τ) be a solution of the ﬂow that exists for
all time. Then, under the above assumptions, we show that for 2 ≤ q ≤ 4 the
W1,q(Z)-limit

A∞ := lim
τ→∞

A(τ)

exists and is an ASD connection in A1,q(P; a).

Our proof of convergence at inﬁnite-time relies on several ingredients. First,
since we have excluded bubbling, it follows immediately from Uhlenbeck’s
weak compactness theorem that we have weak subsequential convergence at
inﬁnite time to a Yang-Mills connection A∞, where the convergence is modulo
gauge and on compact sets. A priori, this limiting connection may depend on
the subsequence chosen, and it may be the case that the asymptotic limits of
A∞ are not a (i.e., A∞ may belong to A1,2(P; a′) for some other ﬂat connection

3

a′). This latter phenomenon is due to the possibility of energy escaping down
the cylindrical ends. To exclude these possibilities, we use the ASD-regularity
and small energy assumptions again to show that the path A(τ) is Cauchy in
W1,q on the full 4-manifold Z. In particular, this implies A∞ does in fact belong
to A1,q(P; a), as desired. Moreover, the positive energy gap forces A∞ to be
ASD, as opposed to just Yang-Mills.

Remark 1.1. (a) S`a Earp [20] considers a similar ﬂow on cylindrical-end K¨ahler man-
ifolds. He makes analogous acyclic assumptions on the asymptotic value a.

(b) The natural Sobolev constants for the ﬂow are k = 1 and p = 2, since these
are the weakest constants relative to which the Yang-Mills functional is well-deﬁned.
However, since the set of W2,2-gauge transformations does not form a well-deﬁned
group (see Remark 2.6), it is difﬁcult to establish any more than a weak solution to the
ﬂow when A0 has regularity W1,2; see (c), below. Due to this and related reasons, we
will typically work with k, p that are sufﬁciently far above this borderline level.

The following remarks refer to authors working over closed 4-manifolds.
(c) Struwe [26] proved that if A0 is in W1,2, then short-time existence and unique-
ness holds for (1) in a weak sense. His results carry over to our setting as well. See
also Remark 3.2.

(d) Schlatter [23] proved long-time existence under the assumption that F+
A0

is L2-
small, and the bundle P has small Pontryagin number. Our approach is in many ways
similar, with the restriction on the Pontryagin number being replaced by the index
assumption on a.

(e) Waldron [28] has recently ruled out ﬁnite-time bubbling under the assumption
that either F+ or F− does not concentrate in L2. Waldron’s arguments are effectively
local in nature, and so extend to our case without much trouble. In particular, the
long-time existence stated above holds even without the two index and regularity as-
sumptions that we have made. That being said, by including these assumptions, we can
exclude bubbling at inﬁnite-time, as well as ﬁnite-time. Moreover, with these assump-
tions, we are able to phrase sufﬁcient conditions for long- and inﬁnite-time existence
purely in terms of an energy condition for the initial connection. Indeed, this is the mo-
tivation for our approach, since it can be used to study the behavior of the ﬂow under
various adiabatic limits of the underlying metric; this is described in more detail [10].

(f) Feehan [11] has obtained similar inﬁnite-time convergence results, where he
uses the Łojasiewicz-Simon’s inequality in place of our (rather strong) index and ASD-
regularity assumptions.

In practice, the acyclic and ASD-regularity assumptions mentioned above
are frequently not satisﬁed. For example, if G = SO(3) and Y = S1 × Σ, with Σ
a surface of genus larger than 1, then all ﬂat connections fail to be acyclic. How-
ever, the acyclic and ASD-regularity assumptions are generic in a certain sense,
and so can often be obtained by perturbing the deﬁning equations. Moreover,
this perturbation scheme ﬁts in nicely with various standard applications of

4

gauge theory to low-dimensional topology; see [6]. Consequently, we con-
sider a suitably perturbed version of the ﬂow (1). We discuss the relevant per-
turbations in Section 2. The discussion culminates with Theorem 2.13 which
states that, for a large class of cylindrical end 4-manifolds, the acyclic and ASD-
regularity assumptions can always be achieved using some such perturbation.
The reader who is not interested in this aspect is welcome to skip to Section 3,
and ignore all perturbation terms (denoted by K and K). Of course, the trade-
off is that the discussion may be vacuous if the regularity assumptions are not
satisﬁed.

Remark 1.2. See Janner [15] for a similar perturbed Yang-Mills ﬂow over 3-manifolds.

2 Gauge theory with perturbations

In Section 2.1 we deﬁne a certain class of perturbations that we will use to
perturb the ﬂow. After deﬁning this class, we introduce these perturbations
into several standard gauge theoretic constructions (e.g., Yang-Mills theory and
Uhlenbeck compactness). This is carried out in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. Section 2.4
provides an existence result providing conditions under which the desirable
perturbations exist.

Before getting into the details of perturbations, we begin by describing our
set-up and notation in the absence of a perturbation. Fix a compact, connected
Lie group G. Since G is compact, its Lie algebra g admits an Ad-invariant inner
product h·, ·i. In order to appeal to standard index calculations, we choose this
inner product as follows. Fix a faithful unitary embedding G → U(N), and use
this to pull back the inner product

hξ, ζi =

1
2π2 tr(ξ · ζ∗) = −

1
2π2 tr(ξ · ζ)

(2)

on u(N) ⊂ End(CN). The coefﬁcient (2π2)−1 is to ensure we obtain integers
for certain characteristic numbers appearing below (see Example 2.4 (b) and
Lemma 2.5).

Let R → X be a principal G-bundle over an oriented Riemannian manifold

X. We will write R(g) → X for the adjoint bundle associated to R, and

Ωk(X, R(g))

for the space of k-forms on X with values in R(g). We will use similar notation
for forms with values in other bundles. The Ad-invariance of the inner product

5

imply that it combines with the wedge to produce a graded-commutative map
of the form

Ωk(X, R(g)) ⊗ Ωℓ(X, R(g)) −→ Ωk+ℓ(Z, R)

V ⊗ W 7−→ hV ∧ Wi.

Similarly, the Lie bracket deﬁnes a graded Lie bracket structure on Ωk(X, R(g)),
which we denote by [V ∧ W].

We will use

A(R),

and

G(R)

for the spaces of smooth connections and gauge transformations, respectively,
on R. Our convention is that G(R) acts on A(R) by pullback (this is a right
action). The space A(R) is naturally an afﬁne space modeled on Ω1(X, R(g)),
and we use additive notation to indicate the associated action.

Associated to each connection A ∈ A(R) is a covariant derivative

dA : Ωk(X, R(g)) −→ Ωk+1(X, R(g)).

This satisﬁes

du∗ AW = Ad(u−1)dA (Ad(u)W) ,

dA+V = dA + [V ∧ ·]

for all k-forms W ∈ Ωk(X, R(g)), 1-forms V ∈ Ω1(X, R(g)), and all gauge
transformations u ∈ G(R). We say that a connection A is irreducible if the
covariant derivative dA is injective on 0-forms.

The curvature of a connection is a 2-form FA ∈ Ω2(X, R(g)). This satisﬁes

dA ◦ dAW = [FA ∧ W] ,

Fu∗ A = Ad(u−1)FA,

FA+V = FA + dAV +

1
2

[V ∧ V]

for all W ∈ Ωk(X, R(g)), V ∈ Ω1(X, R(g)), and u ∈ G(R).

2.1 Deﬁnition of the perturbations

Here we deﬁne the relevant class of perturbations. We begin by discussing the
asymptotic behavior down the cylindrical end Y, then we discuss the perturba-
tion on the rest of Z. We refer the reader to [10] for more details of the various
assertions claimed in this section.

2.1.1 Perturbations on Y

Let Q → Y be as in the introduction. Fix a map of the form

K : A(Q) −→ Ω2(Y, Q(g)),

a 7−→ Ka.

(3)

6

We will always assume this is gauge equivariant in the sense that

Ku∗a = Ad(u−1)Ka

for all a ∈ A(Q) and all gauge transformations u ∈ G(Q). We will refer to K as
a perturbation on Y. We will use this to perturb the curvature, by setting

Fa,K := Fa − Ka.

We will say a connection a ∈ A(Q) is K-ﬂat if Fa,K = 0.

Denote the linearization of K at a by

dKa : Ω1(Y, Q(g)) −→ Ω2(Y, Q(g)).

We will typically assume K is chosen to satisfy the following.

Axiom 0. The perturbation K is chosen so that dKa is symmetric in the sense that

ZY

hdKa(v) ∧ wi = ZY

hv ∧ dKa(w)i

for all v, w ∈ Ω1(Y, Q(g)).

The next example shows that this axiom is not difﬁcult to arrange.

Example 2.1. (a) Fix a function H : A(Q) → R, and let (dH)a ∈ T∗
derivative at a. Then deﬁne Ka ∈ Ω2(Y, Q(g)) by

a A(Q) be the

(dH)av = ZY

hKa ∧ vi

for all v ∈ Ω1(Y, Qg)). (We are using the integral to identify Ω2(Y, Q(g)) with the
dual of TaA(Q) = Ω1(Y, Q(g)).) Then this satisﬁes Axiom 0.

(b) Here is a variant of the above that will be useful later. Suppose Σ ⊂ Y is an
embedded surface that is closed and oriented. Fix a function h : A(Q|Σ) → R, and
for α ∈ A(Q|Σ), deﬁne a 1-form Xα by

dhα(ν) = ZΣ

hXα ∧ νi

for all ν ∈ Ω1(Σ, P(g)). Next, thicken Σ up to a neighborhood U × Σ ⊂ Y, for some
interval U. Fix a function f : U → R that is supported in the interior of U. Then
declare

Ya := d f ∧ Xa|,

where a| denotes the restriction of a to {t} × Σ ⊂ U × Σ. This also satisﬁes Axiom 0.

We will say a K-ﬂat connection a ∈ A(Q) is acyclic if the matrix

(cid:18) ∗da − ∗dKa −da
0 (cid:19)

−d∗
a

7

(4)

is injective as an operator on Ω1(Y, Q(g)) ⊕ Ω0(Y, Q(g)); the Hodge star ap-
pearing here is the one on Y. The primary relevance of Axiom 0 is that it im-
plies the matrix (4) is self-adjoint relative to the L2-inner product

(v, w) := ZY

hv ∧ ∗wi.

2.1.2 Perturbations on Z

Moving to the 4-manifold Z, we are interested in gauge equivariant maps of
the form

K : A(P) −→ Ω2(Z, P(g)),

A 7−→ KA.

(5)

We will assume that, for each ℓ ≥ 1, p ∈ [1, ∞], the map K is smooth relative to
the W ℓ,p-topology on the domain an codomain. We will also assume any such
K is translationally-invariant on the cylindrical end, in the following sense: Fix
A ∈ A(P), and write

A|[0,∞)×Y = a + p ds

so a : [0, ∞) → A(Q) is a path of connections and p : [0, ∞) → Ω0(Y, Q(g)) is
a path of 0-forms. Then we assume there is some K as in (3) so that

KA|[0,∞)×Y = Ka.

Any map K satisfying the above will be called a perturbation, and we will refer
to K as the induced perturbation on Y. We will say that K satisﬁes Axiom 0 if the
induced perturbation on Y satisﬁes Axiom 0.

Remark 2.2. A particularly special case is when Z is the cylinder R × Y. Any pertur-
bation on Y uniquely determines a translationally-invariant perturbation on R × Y.
We will use KY to denote perturbations on Z obtained in this way.

We will want to assume our perturbations satisfy certain uniform bounds.

To state the relevant bounds, set

Ωk := Ωk(Z, P(g)).

Then we will use dℓKA : ⊗ℓΩ1 → Ω2 to denote the ℓth derivative of K at A.
Axiom 1. (Analytic axiom) For any integers ℓ, k ≥ 0, and p ∈ [1, ∞], there is a
constant CK(k, ℓ, p) so that

kdℓKA(V1, V2, . . . , Vℓ)kW k,p

≤ CK(k, ℓ, p)(cid:16)1 + kFA,Kkk

W k−1,p(cid:17) kV1kW k,pkV2kW k,p . . . kVℓkW k,p

(6)

for all connections A, and compactly supported 1-forms V1, . . . , Vℓ ∈ Ω1(Z, P(g)).
All norms are on Z.

8

For example, when ℓ = k = 0, this gives a uniform bound of the form

kKAkLp ≤ CK(0, 0, p)

for all connections A. In Section 2.4 we will discuss a class of perturbations
that satisfy this axiom.

As in the 3-dimensional case, we set

FA,K := FA − KA.

The linearization of the map A 7→ FA,K is the operator

dA,K := dA − dKA : Ω1 −→ Ω2.

Just as the covariant derivative dA is deﬁned on forms of all degrees, we
want to extend dA,K to an operator on all forms on Z. To do this, we deﬁne
maps

Ω0 dKA−→ Ω1 dKA−→ Ω2 dKA−→ Ω3 dKA−→ Ω4,

(7)

as follows:

• Declare dKA : Ω0 → Ω1 to be the zero map.

• The map dKA : Ω1 → Ω2 is the linearization of A 7→ KA, as above.

• Declare dKA : Ω2 → Ω3 to be the Banach space dual to dKA : Ω1 → Ω2.
Using the identiﬁcation (Ωi)∗ = Ω4−i coming from integration, this can
be equivalently deﬁned by the property

ZZ

hdKA(W) ∧ Vi = −ZZ

hW ∧ dKA(V)i

for W ∈ Ω2, V ∈ Ω1 (the minus sign is the account for the grading).

• Deﬁne dKA : Ω3 → Ω4 to be the zero map. Note that this is the Banach

space dual to dKA : Ω0 → Ω1.

Of course, the only interesting part of this is the extension to 2-forms. Note
that this is consistent with Axiom 0 and the requirement that K agrees with K
on the ends.

It follows that dA,K : ⊕kΩk → ⊕kΩk is its own Banach space adjoint, up to
the usual sign coming from the grading. Similarly, we can form the L2-Hilbert
space adjoint by setting

d∗
A,K := −(−1)(4−k)(k−1) ∗ dA,K∗ : Ωk −→ Ωk−1.

This satisﬁes

9

for all compactly supported V ∈ Ωk−1, W ∈ Ωk, where now (·, ·) is the L2-inner
product on Z coming from the metric.

(dA,KV, W) =(cid:0)V, d∗

A,KW(cid:1)

It will be convenient if dA,K and FA,K satisfy the Bianchi identity dA,KFA,K =
0, and similar algebraic identities. For this and similar purposes, we impose the
following axiom on K.

Axiom 2. (Algebraic axiom) The following holds for each A ∈ A(P):

(i) dKA ◦ dKA = 0

(ii) dKA(KA) = 0

(iii) hKA ∧ KAi = 0

(iv) dA(KA) = −dKA(FA).

To construct an example of a perturbation satisfying this, repeat the con-
struction of Example 2.1 (b), but interpret U × Σ as a neighborhood in Z (so U
is a surface, as opposed to an interval).

Note that the gauge equivariance of K automatically gives

dKA (dAφ) = [KA, φ]

for all φ ∈ Ω0(Z, P(g)). Combining this with Axiom 2, it follows that dA,K
behaves algebraically like a usual covariant derivative.

Corollary 2.3. Assume Axiom 2. Then the following holds for each A ∈ A(P) and
φ ∈ Ω0(Z, P(g)):

(Curvature Identity)
(First Bianchi Identity)
(Second Bianchi Identity) d∗

dA,K ◦ dA,Kφ = [FA, φ]
dA,KFA,K = 0
A,Kd∗

A,KFA,K = 0.

2.2 Perturbed Chern-Simons and Yang-Mills theory

Let K be a perturbation, with K the induced perturbation on Y. Unless other-
wise speciﬁed, we assume these satisfy Axiom 0, Axiom 1, and Axiom 2.

2.2.1 Chern-Simons theory

Deﬁne the perturbed Chern-Simons functional by setting

CS K,P : A(Q) −→ R,

CS K,P(a) := −

hFA,K ∧ FA,Ki,

where A is any connection in A1,2(R; a). It follows from the ﬁrst Bianchi iden-
tity that this is independent of the choice of A. Similarly, it depends on K only
through its asymptotic value K.

1

2 ZZ

10

The perturbed Chern-Simons functional is invariant under the set of gauge
transformations on Q that can be homotoped to the identity; for a more gen-
eral statement, see (8). The critical points of CS K,P are precisely the K-ﬂat con-
nections, and the upper left-hand component of the matrix (4) represents the
Hessian of CS K,P relative to the L2-inner product. Consequently, a K-ﬂat con-
nection is acyclic if and only if it is (i) irreducible and (ii) a non-degenerate
critical point of CS K,P, modulo gauge.

The perturbed Chern-Simons functional can be viewed as a relative char-
acteristic class for 4-manifolds with boundary or cylindrical ends. As such, it
is intimately related to an absolute characteristic class for closed 4-manifolds.
We describe this now. Fix a principal G-bundle R over a closed, connected,
oriented 4-manifold X. Then

κ(R) :=

1

2 ZX

hFA ∧ FAi

depends only on the topological type of R. The following examples relate this
to standard characteristic classes (recall from (2) that the inner product h·, ·i is
induced from an embedding G ֒→ U(N)).

Example 2.4. (a) Suppose G = SU(N) for N ≥ 2, and the embedding G ֒→ U(N)
from above is the inclusion. Then the Chern-Weil formula gives

κ(R) = 2c2(R) [X] ∈ 2Z.

(b) Suppose G = U(N) for N ≥ 2, and the embedding G ֒→ U(N) is just the

identity. Then

κ(R) = 2(cid:18)c2(R) −

1
2

c2

1(R)(cid:19) [X] ∈ Z.

(c) Suppose G = SO(r) for r ≥ 2, and the embedding G ֒→ SU(N) ⊂ U(N) is
C. Then the induced inner product

given by the complexiﬁed adjoint action of G on g
on g is −(2π2)−1 times the Killing form, and

κ(R) = −2(r − 2)p1(R) [X] ∈ 2(r − 2)Z

where p1 is the Pontryagin class. Note that this vanishes for r = 2, reﬂecting the fact
that SO(2) is abelian.

(d) Suppose G = PU(r) for r ≥ 2, and the embedding G ֒→ SU(N) ⊂ U(N) is

given by the complexiﬁed adjoint action. Then

κ(R) = 2q4(R) [X] ∈ 2Z,

where q4(R) ∈ H4(X, Z) is a PU(r)-generalization of the ﬁrst Pontryagin number;
see [30] and [9].

More generally, we have the following.

11

Lemma 2.5. Fix G and h·, ·i as above, and let X be a closed, connected, oriented 4-
manifold X. Then κ(R) is an integer for every principal G-bundle R → X. If G is not
abelian, then there are principal G-bundles R for which κ(R) is non-zero.

Proof. The class

2c2 − c2

1 ∈ H4(BU(N), Z) = Zhc2i ⊕ Zhc2
1i

is a primitive element of the 4th cohomology of the classifying space BU(N).
Moreover, the embedding G ֒→ U(N) induces an inclusion

BG ֒→ BU(N),

and the universal property for BU(N) shows that this inclusion is unique up
to homotopy. Let

κG ∈ H4(G, Z)

be the pullback of 2c2 − c2

1 under this embedding.

Fix a bundle R → X and consider its classifying map ψR : X ֒→ BG. Using
this, we can pull back κG to a class in H4(X, Z). By Example 2.4 (b) and the
deﬁnition of the inner product on g, this pulled back class is exactly κ(R) ∈ R.
That is,

which shows κ(R) is an integer.

κ(R) = (ψ∗

RκG) [X] ∈ Z,

To see this is non-zero when G is not abelian, ﬁrst note that each compact
Lie group G has a ﬁnite cover that is a product of tori and compact simple Lie
groups. In particular, when G is not abelian, there is a Lie group homomor-
phism

φ : SU(2) −→ G

with the property that

φ∗κG = j κSU(2) ∈ H4(BSU(2), Z)

for some non-zero integer j (this integer reﬂects the aforementioned ﬁnite cover
of G). We already know that there are SU(2)-bundles R′ → X for which
(ψ∗

R′κSU(2)) [X] is non-zero. Fixing such a bundle R′, deﬁne

R := R′ ×SU(2) G,

where SU(2) acts on G by the homomorphism φ. Then

κ(R) = (φ∗

RκG) [X] = j(cid:16)φ∗

R′ κSU(2)(cid:17) [X] 6= 0,

as desired.

As an application of this characteristic number, let Q → Y be a principal G-
bundle on a 3-manifold, and suppose u is a gauge transformation on Q. Then
the mapping torus of u is a bundle Qu over S1 × Y, and the integer κ(Qu) ∈ Z
depends only on u up to isotopy. Moreover, it follows immediately from the
deﬁnitions that if a is any connection on Q and K is any perturbation, then

CS K,P(u∗a) − CS K,P(a) = κ(Qu) ∈ Z.

2.2.2 Yang-Mills theory

The perturbed Yang-Mills functional, or energy, is deﬁned by

YMK(A) :=

1
2

kFA,Kk2

L2(Z) =

1

2 ZZ

hFA,K ∧ ∗FA,Ki.

We view this as a real-valued function on A1,2(P; a). This is invariant under
the action of the group

G(P; e)

of smooth gauge transformations on P that, together with their derivatives,
decay rapidly down the cylindrical end to the identity gauge transformation e
on Q.

Remark 2.6. (a) Suppose a is irreducible. Then it follows that the gauge group G(P; e)
acts freely on A(P; a). See [10, Prop. 3.7].

(b) Let G k,p(P; e) denote the Wk,p-completion of G(P; e). When kp > 4, this
forms a Banach Lie group that acts smoothly and smoothly on Ak,p(P; a). Moreover,
the perturbed Yang-Mills functional is invariant under this action. However, the set
G2,2(P; e) is not a group, due to the failure of the Sobolev multiplication theorem at the
borderline level.

The critical points of YMK on A1,2(P; a) are those connections that satisfy

d∗
A,KFA,K = 0.

We call these connections K-YM. As in the unperturbed case, the perturbed
Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons functionals are intimately related. Indeed, for
any A ∈ A1,2(P; a), we have

YMK(A) = kF+

A,Kk2

L2(Z) + CS K,P(a),

(9)

where

F+
A,K :=

1
2

(FA,K + ∗FA,K)

is the anti-self dual part. We say a connection is K-ASD if F+
A,K = 0. The K-ASD
connections are automatically K-YM by the ﬁrst Bianchi identity. Moreover, it
follows from (9) that if there are any K-ASD connections in A1,2(P; a), then
they are the global minimizers of YMK on A1,2(P; a).

13

The linearization of the map A 7→ F+

A,K at a connection A is the operator

d+
A,K :=

1
2

(1 + ∗)dA,K : Ω1(Z, P(g)) → Ω+(Z, P(g)).

We will say that a K-ASD connection A is ASD-regular if d+
will say that K is ASD-regular if each of the following holds.

A,K is surjective. We

• The perturbation K satisﬁes Axiom 0.

• All K-ﬂat connections on Q are acyclic.

• For all K-ﬂat a, every K-ASD connection A ∈ A1,2(P; a) is ASD-regular.

• For each pair a−, a+ of K-ﬂat connections, if A is any KY-ASD connection

on R × Q that is asymptotic to a± at ±∞, then A is ASD-regular.

In the last bullet, KY is the perturbation on R × Y induced from K as in Remark
2.2, and the KY-ASD condition should be deﬁned using the cylindrical metric
ds2 + gY on R × Y.

The primary usefulness of ASD-regularity is that it asserts that for each K-

ﬂat a, the moduli space

nA ∈ A1,p(P; a) | F+

A,K = 0o. G2,p(P; e)

(10)

of K-ASD connections is a smooth manifold. Here we need to assume p > 2 in
order to have a good gauge group.

Remark 2.7. Elsewhere in the literature, the term we are calling ‘ASD-regular’ is
often simply called ‘regular’. We have introduced the preﬁx ‘ASD’ to help distinguish
the term from the function-theoretic notion of regularity.

2.2.3 The index

Assume Axiom 0. Fix a K-ﬂat connection a, and assume this is acyclic. For
A ∈ A1,2(P; a), consider the operator

d+
A,K ⊕ d∗

A,K : Ω1(Z, P(g)) −→ Ω+(Z, P(g)) ⊕ Ω0(Z, P(g)).

Since a is acyclic, this operator is Fredholm in suitable Sobolev completions of
the domain and codomain. In particular, it has a well-deﬁned Fredholm index

IndK,P(a)

and this index depends only on a, K (the asymptotic values of A, K). This index
is exactly the dimension of the moduli space (10).

Fix a gauge transformation u on Q. Then by the argument of [6, Prop. 3.16],

we have the following action-index identity

nG (CS K,P(u∗a) − CS K,P(a)) = IndK,P(u∗a) − IndK,P(a).

(11)

14

Here nG ≥ 0 is a number depending only on the Lie group G, and the choice of
inner product on g. Given our choice of inner product, it follows from (8) that
nG is a rational number. When G is not abelian, then nG is uniquely determined
by (11) since there are a, u for which both sides are non-zero. Conversely, when
G is abelian, both sides of (11) are zero for all a, u; this reﬂects the triviality
of the group π3(G) = 0. In the abelian case, we are therefore free to declare
nG = 1.

Example 2.8. (a) Suppose G = SU(N) and the embedding G ֒→ U(N) is the iden-
tity. Then nG = 2r. See [6, Prop. 3.16].

(b) Suppose G = PU(r) and the embedding G ֒→ SU(N) ⊂ U(N) is given by

the complexiﬁed adjoint action. Then nG = 1. See [10, Prop. 6.6].

2.3 Uhlenbeck compactness

We will need a perturbed version of Uhlenbeck’s compactness theorem that
keeps track of energy loss down the cylindrical end. To state the version we
need, ﬁx a K-ﬂat connection a. Then we deﬁne a broken trajectory on Z asymptotic
to a to consist of the following:

• A tuple (a0, a1, . . . , aJ) of K-ﬂat connections on Q with aJ = a.

• A connection A0 ∈ A1,2(P; a0) asymptotic to a0.

• A tuple (B1, . . . , BJ) of connections on R × Q.

These are required to satisfy

lim
s→−∞

Bj|{s}×Y = aj−1,

lim
s→+∞

Bj|{s}×Y = aj.

We will typically denote a broken trajectory by (A0; B1, . . . , BJ), with the asymp-
totic K-ﬂat connections aj understood. A broken trajectory is a broken K-YM
trajectory (resp. broken K-ASD trajectory) if A0 and the Bj are all K-YM (resp.
K-ASD).

Let H be a function space (e.g., C ∞ or W1,p). We will say that a sequence
An ∈ A1,p(P; a) of connections converges in H to a broken trajectory if, for
each 1 ≤ j ≤ J, there is a tuple {sj
n}n of positive real numbers satisfying the
following:

• For each compact subset C ⊂ Z, the sequence An converges in H(C) to

A0.

• For each j, the sequence sj

n increases to ∞.

• For each n, we have s1

An converges in

n

We say that the sequence converges modulo bubbling if the convergence to A0
holds on the complement of a ﬁnite set of points on Z, and the convergence
to each Bj is on the complement of a ﬁnite set of points in R × Y (this set is
allowed to depend on j). For more details, see [19, Chapter 6] or [12]; see also
[21] for a nice treatment in the closely related case of holomorphic curves.

Here is a version of Uhlenbeck’s compactness theorem with a curvature

hypothesis that a priori excludes bubbling.

Theorem 2.9. (Uhlenbeck [27]) Assume K is a perturbation satisfying Axiom 0 and
Axiom 1, and so that all K-ﬂat connections are acyclic. Fix p > 2, and suppose An ∈
A1,p(P; a) is a sequence of smooth K-YM connections with

YMK(An) < ∞,

and

sup

n

sup

n

kFAn kL∞(Z) < ∞.

(12)

Then there is a subsequence (still denoted by An), and a sequence of gauge transforma-
tions Un ∈ A2,p(P; e) so that the U∗
n An converge in C ∞ to a broken K-YM trajectory
asymptotic to a.

Due to the presence of the uniform L∞-bound in (12), the proof essentially
follows from the same analysis as the unperturbed version of Uhlenbeck’s the-
orem [27]. See [10, Prop. 3.8] for details in the presence of a perturbation. The
next remark addresses the situation in the presence of bubbling.

Remark 2.10. (a) Suppose An is a sequence of connections in A1,p(P; a) (not neces-
sarily K-YM) with a uniform bound on kFAn kL2(Z) and kFAn kL∞(Z). Then Uhlen-
beck’s weak compactness theorem [29, Theorem B] implies that a subsequence converges
weakly in W1,p on compact subsets, after possibly applying suitable gauge transforma-
tions.

More generally, suppose there was a ﬁnite set of points {zn} ⊂ Z with the prop-
erty that, for each compact B ⊂ Z\ {zn} there is a uniform bound on kFAn kL∞(B).
Then modulo gauge, a subsequence converges weakly in W1,p on compact subsets of
Z\ {zn}. (Note that even if the An are K-ASD, more work needs to be done to con-
clude that the limit is K-ASD as well. This is because we have made no assumptions
about the behavior of K under weak W1,p-limits. This is described further in (b).)

(b) As described by Kronheimer [17], due to the non-local nature of the typical
perturbations appearing in gauge theory (i.e., holonomy perturbations), compactness
statements in the presence of perturbations and bubbling are rather subtle. For ex-
ample, suppose the An are K-ASD, but the kFAn kL∞ are unbounded. Then one cannot
expect to obtain the strong C ∞-convergence on the complement of the bubbling set, as

16

is the case in the unperturbed setting. However, Kronheimer does prove strong W1,p-
convergence in the complement of bubbling set, at least for perturbations K satisfying
the conclusion of [17, Lemma 10].

It is perhaps worth emphasizing that the issues here are not so much due to es-
tablishing bounds on sequence of connections, but in showing that the perturbation
behaves well relative to weakly convergent subsequences.

As in the unperturbed case, Theorem 2.9 and the acyclic assumption can be
used to show that any ﬁnite-energy K-YM connection A on Z is asymptotic to
some K-ﬂat connection a ∈ A(Q); see [6, Section 4.1]. Moreover, writing

A|[0,∞)×Y = a(s) + p(s) ds

this convergence is exponential in the sense that a(s) (resp. p(s)) converges to a
(resp. to 0) exponentially and in C ∞(Y). This implies the following reﬁnement
of Uhlenbeck’s theorem.

Corollary 2.11. Assume K is a perturbation satisfying Axiom 0 and Axiom 1, and so
that all K-ﬂat connections are acyclic. Suppose An is a sequence of K-YM connections
converging in C ∞ to a broken K-YM trajectory (A0; B1, . . . , BJ). Fix 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ and
an integer ℓ ≥ 0. Then for each δ > 0, there are compact sets

Remark 2.12. Assume K is ASD-regular. Then Floer’s gluing theorem [12] provides
a converse to the above compactness statement for K-ASD connections. Namely, sup-
pose (A0; B1, . . . , BJ) is a broken K-ASD trajectory asymptotic to a. Then using an
implicit function theorem, Floer showed there is a sequence of K-ASD connections
An ∈ A1,p(P; a) that converge in C ∞ to (A0; B1, . . . , BJ).

2.4 Existence of suitable perturbations

To avoid a vacuous discussion below (in particular, in Section 4), we need some
sort of existence statement for perturbations satisfying the axioms above.

17

Theorem 2.13. Assume Q → Y is such that all ﬂat connections are irreducible. Then
there exists a perturbation K that is ASD-regular and satisﬁes Axiom 0, Axiom 1, and
Axiom 2.

Sketch of Proof. Theorem 2.13 was proved in [10, Prop. 6.11]. The idea is to re-
strict to perturbations having the form described in Example 2.1 (b), since these
automatically satisfy Axiom 0 and Axiom 2. Next, restrict further to the family
F of perturbations where the function h is deﬁned by considering holonomy
over thickened loops in the surface Σ; see [6, Section 5.5]. Here we are using
the notation of Example 2.1 (b). Then each K ∈ F satisﬁes Axiom 1; see [17,
Prop. 7]. The key point, however, is that this family F is large enough to con-
tain a comeager set of perturbations satisfying all conditions of ASD-regularity
(except possibly the irreducibility condition for K-ﬂat connections). The ex-
istence of this comeager set follows from a Sard-Smale argument that is now
fairly standard in gauge theory; we refer the reader to Donaldson’s book [6,
Section 5.5] for a nice general treatment. This ultimately comes down to the
idea that connections are distinguished by their holonomy. Finally, to obtain
irreducibility of K-ﬂat connections, use the fact that irreducibility is an open
condition, and so the assumptions on Q imply that all K-ﬂat connections will
be irreducible provided K is sufﬁciently small.

The next example shows that bundles Q satisfying the hypotheses of Theo-

rem 2.13 are fairly abundant.

Example 2.14. (a) Suppose G = SO(3) and Y has positive ﬁrst Betti number. Fix
any non-torsion class γ ∈ H1(Y, Z2), and deﬁne Q → Y to be the principal SO(3)-
bundle whose Stiefel-Whitney class w2(Q) ∈ H2(Y, Z2) is Poincar´e dual to γ. Then
all ﬂat connections on Q are irreducible.

This strategy generalizes to G = PU(r) for r ≥ 2.
(b) Suppose Y is any 3-manifold. Then taking the connect sum with the torus Y#T3
produces a 3-manifold with positive ﬁrst Betti number. In particular, for each r ≥ 2,
the manifold Y#T3 admits a PU(r)-bundle with no reducible ﬂat connections. This
strategy is due to Kronheimer-Mrowka [18].

3 Short-time existence for the ﬂow

Fix a perturbation K, and let K be the induced perturbation on Y. Suppose a is
a K-ﬂat connection on Q, and consider the perturbed Yang-Mills functional

YMK : A1,2(P; a) ∩ Ak,p(P; a) −→ R.

We intersect with A1,2(P, a) to ensure we obtain a ﬁnite Yang-Mills value. The
L2-gradient of YMK is the vector ﬁeld A 7→ d∗
A,KFA,K. The (perturbed) Yang-
Mills ﬂow is the negative gradient ﬂow of YMK:

∂τ A = −d∗

A,KFA,K,

A(0) = A0,

(13)

18

where A0 ∈ A1,2(P; a) ∩ Ak′,p′
(P; a) is some ﬁxed initial condition, and the
unknown A is a path in A1,2(P; a) ∩ Ak,p(P; a). Here k′, p′ are Sobolev constants
that, for us, will typically be higher than k, p (though ideally k = k′ and p =
p′). The ﬂow (13) is invariant under the action of the gauge group G2,2(P; e) ∩
G k+1,p(P; e), provided (k + 1)p > 4; see Remark 2.6. When K = 0, the ﬂow (13)
is exactly the ﬂow (1) from the introduction.

In this section we establish short-time existence of the ﬂow (13) under mild
hypotheses on A0. The statements of the results are given in Section 3.1, with
the proofs being deferred to Section 3.3. In the intermediary Section 3.2, we
discuss how the cylindrical end case compares with the more standard case
where Z is closed.

3.1 Statements of the short-time existence results

Fix a perturbation K. Throughout this section, we assume this satisﬁes Axiom 0,
Axiom 1, and Axiom 2. We assume further that a ∈ A(Q) is a K-ﬂat connection
that is acyclic. Fix a smooth reference connection

Are f ∈ A1,2(P; a);

deﬁne all Sobolev norms relative to this connection (coupled with the Levi-
Civita connection on Z).

Theorem 3.1. (Short-time existence) Fix 4 < p < ∞, as well as an initial condition
A0 ∈ A1,2(P; a) ∩ A2,p(P; a). Then there is some τ1 > 0, and a unique solution

A ∈ C 0(cid:16) [0, τ1) , A1,2(P; a)(cid:17) ∩ C 1(cid:16) (0, τ1) × Z(cid:17) ∩ C 0

loc(cid:16) (0, τ1) , A2,2(P; a)(cid:17) (14)

to the perturbed Yang-Mills ﬂow (13). Moreover, the curvature has regularity at least

FA ∈ C 0(cid:16) [0, τ1) , L2(Z)(cid:17) ∩ C 1(cid:16) (0, τ1) × Z(cid:17) ∩ L∞

loc(cid:16) (0, τ1) , W2,2(Z)(cid:17).

If A0 is C ∞(Z), then the solution A is in C ∞ ([0, τ1) × Z).

(15)

We carry the proof out in Section 3.3.1. Note that the acyclic assumption
on a implies that all connections in A1,2(P; a) are irreducible, and so we do not
need to impose irreducibility as an additional hypothesis to obtain uniqueness.

Remark 3.2. (a) The ﬂow (13) is not parabolic due to its invariance under the action
of the gauge group. One consequence of this is that the ﬂow is typically not smoothing.
For example, suppose the initial condition A0 is a Yang-Mills connection. Then the
constant path A(τ) = A0 clearly solves (13), but it only has as much regularity as
A0. By applying a gauge transformation with low regularity, it is not hard to construct
Yang-Mills connections that are A1,2(P; a) ∩ Ak,p(P; a), but not smooth.

(b) A more natural initial condition would be to simply assume A0 is in A1,2(P; a).
However, Struwe [26] pointed out that the gauge equivariance of the ﬂow makes it

19

unlikely that one can expect much more than a weak solution to (13) if A0 only has
W1,2-regularity, even in the closed, unperturbed case. That being said, Struwe was
able to establish a weak solution for W1,2-initial conditions, and he showed that the
weak solution is gauge equivalent (in a certain sense) to a strong solution. Moreover,
his proof extends, without much difﬁculty, to our situation with cylindrical ends and
a perturbation (we discuss this in more detail in Section 3.2). That is, in our case as
well as Struwe’s, we have that whenever A0 ∈ A1,2(P; a), there is a unique path

A ∈ C 0(cid:16)[0, τ1] , A0,2(P; a)(cid:17) ∩ W1,2(cid:16)(0, τ1) , A0,2(P; a)(cid:17)

satisfying (13) weakly. This has the additional property that

FA,K ∈ C 0(cid:16)[0, τ1) , L2(Z)(cid:17) ,

and A is gauge equivalent to a smooth solution in the sense described in [24, Theorem
1.1(i)].

(c) One can improve on the regularity in (14) and (15) in various ways. For exam-

ple, we will see in the proof that d∗

AFA is in L∞

loc((0, τ1), W2,2(Z)).

As in the closed case [26, 24], the maximal existence time for the ﬂow is
determined by concentration of energy. The new feature coming from the non-
compactness is that it is conceivable the energy concentrates at points that es-
cape down the cylindrical end.

Proposition 3.3. (Energy concentration) Under the hypotheses and notation of The-
orem 3.1, there is some ηS4 > 0 so that the maximal existence time from Theorem 3.1
is characterized by

τ := sup(τ1 > 0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∃R > 0,

sup

z∈Z, 0≤τ≤τ1ZBR(z)

|FA(τ),K|2 > ηS4) .

At τ = τ, the curvature concentrates at at most a ﬁnite number of points

(z01, . . . , z0K0; (s11, y11), . . . , (s1K1, y1K1); . . . ; (sJ1, y J1), . . . , (sJKJ , y JKJ ))

∈ ZK0 × (R × Y)K1 × . . . × (R × Y)KJ

in the following sense:

• (Energy concentration on Z) The points z01, . . . , z0K0 have the property that

∀1 ≤ k ≤ K0, ∀R > 0,

lim sup

τրτ ZBR(z0k)

|FA(τ),K|2 > ηS4 ;

(16)

• (Energy concentration down the cylindrical ends) There are a ﬁnite number

s1(τ), . . . , sJ(τ)

20

of functions [0, τ) → R with the property that

0 < s1(τ) < s2(τ) < . . . < sJ(τ),

∀0 ≤ τ < τ

and

lim
τրτ

sj(τ) − sj−1(τ) = ∞,

∀1 ≤ j ≤ J,

where s0(τ) := 0. Moreover, for each 1 ≤ j ≤ J, the points

(sj1, yj1), . . . , (sjKj, yjKj) ∈ R × Y

are such that

∀1 ≤ k ≤ Kj, ∀R > 0,

lim sup

τրτ ZBR((sj(τ)+sjk,yjk))

|FA(τ),K|2 > ηS4 .

(17)

In the conclusion of Proposition 3.3, we are viewing the translated points

(sj(τ) + sjk, yjk) ∈ [0, ∞) × Y ⊂ Z

as belonging to Z. Of course, this assumes τ is close enough to τ so sj(τ) + sjk ≥
0 for all j, k. See Section 3.3.2 for a proof of this proposition. The proof will
show that the quantity ηS4 can be taken to be the inﬁmum of kFAk2
L2(S4) over
all non-ﬂat Yang-Mills connections A on bundles over S4; we show in Section
4.1 that this inﬁmum is positive.

To set up for a more uniform discussion below, we set

zτ
0k := z0k,

and

zτ
jk := (sj(τ) + sjk, yjk),

j > 0.

We will refer to the points zτ

jk (for any j, k) as the bubbling points.

By rescaling around each bubbling point, one can show that a Yang-Mills

bubble on S4 forms as τ approaches the maximal ﬂow time τ.

Proposition 3.4. (Bubble formation) At each bubbling point, a non-ﬂat Yang-Mills
connection on a bundle over S4 separates, in the following sense:

In the notation of Proposition 3.3, ﬁx 0 ≤ j ≤ J and 1 ≤ k ≤ K0, as well as
jk) relative

sequences τn ր τ, and Rn ց 0. Let d be the trivial connection on BR1(zτ
to some ﬁxed trivialization of the bundle over BR1(zτ

jk). Write

A(τ)|BR1

jk) = d + M(τ)
(zτ

for some Lie algebra-valued 1-form M. Deﬁne a connection on BRn(0) ⊂ R4 by

An(x) := d + Rn M(τn; zτ

jk + Rnx).

Then the An converge, modulo gauge and in W1,p
loc (R4), to non-ﬂat Yang-Mills con-
nection on R4 with ﬁnite energy. This Yang-Mills connection extends to a unique
smooth non-ﬂat Yang-Mills connection AS4 on some bundle over S4.

21

The proof is given in Section 3.3.2. In the statement of the above proposi-
tion, we are implicitly assuming that R1 > 0 is small enough so that the ball
BR1(zτ
jk) ⊂ Z is contractible. Note also that the trivialization of the bundle over
BR1(zτ
jk) is independent of τ. This is obvious when j = 0 since zτ
0k = z0k. When
j > 0 this follows because the bundle is translationally-invariant on the cylin-
drical end.

Even in the presence of bubbling, the connections A(τ) converge in a rather
weak sense on the complement of the bubbling set on Z. When bubbles form in
ﬁnite time, we obtain a statement familiar from the closed setting [24, Theorem
1.3] in the sense that we have L2-convergence on the full 4-manifold.

Proposition 3.5. (Convergence with ﬁnite-time bubbling) Let A be as in the state-
ment of Proposition 3.4. Assume the maximal existence time τ < ∞ is ﬁnite. Then
there is a ﬁnite-energy connection

with the property that, as τ increases to τ, the connections A(τ) converge to A1 in
L2 (Z) ∩ W1,2

loc(cid:16)P|Z\{z01,...,z0K0}(cid:17)

A1 ∈ A0,2(cid:16)P; a(cid:17) ∩ A1,2

We prove Proposition 3.5 in Section 3.3.3. Note that the convergence of
A(τ) is on the complement of the bubbling points z0k (as opposed to being on
the complement of all bubbling points zjk for j > 0). This is because, for any
ﬁxed compact set C ⊂ Z, the remaining bubbling points zτ
jk, with j > 0, all exit
C when τ is sufﬁciently close to τ. On the other hand, the energy inequality
(18) remembers all bubbling points. The interpretation of the integers njk is that
the quantity ηS4 njk is (a lower bound for) the energy of the Yang-Mills bubble
forming at zτ
jk.

Remark 3.6. It follows from Uhlenbeck’s theorem on removal of singularities [27,
Theorem 2.1] that the limiting connection A1 from Proposition 3.5 extends over the
bubbling points z0k by possibly modifying the underlying bundle. The ﬁnite-energy
and L2(Z)-convergence then imply that A1 is gauge equivalent to a connection in
A1,2(P1; u∗
1 a) for some principal G-bundle P1 → Z and gauge transformation u1.
More precisely, the bundle P1 → Z is such that there is a bundle isomorphism

U1 : P1|Z\{z01,...,z0K0}

∼=−→ P|Z\{z01,...,z0K0},

and P1 is cylindrical on the end in the sense that

P1|[s1,∞)×Y

∼= [s1, ∞) × Q.

22

This is the same bundle Q that is associated with P, and s1 ≥ 0 is large enough so
that [s1, ∞) × Y does not contain any of the z0k. The pullback connection U∗
1 A1 is
asymptotic to u∗
1 a, for some gauge transformation u1 on Q. Moreover, this pullback
connection extends uniquely to an element of A1,2(P1; u∗

1 a).

Intuitively, the gauge transformation u1 on Q captures the bubbles that have es-
jk for j > 0. Similarly,

caped down the cylindrical end; i.e., those bubbles associated to zτ
the map U1 reﬂects the bubbles associated to the z0k.

3.2 Comparison with the closed case

Here we compare our set-up to the case where the base manifold is closed and
there are no perturbations. For concreteness, we focus on Struwe’s paper [26]
as a representative of this latter case. The point we want to emphasize is that
Struwe’s argument holds almost verbatim by simply replacing every D = dA
with dA,K, and every F = FA with FA,K (D and F are Struwe’s notation). To
qualify the term ‘almost’, we begin by addressing the concerns one may have
in passing from the closed case to the case with cylindrical ends, as well as how
to deal with these concerns. We then move on to address the perturbations.

Passage to cylindrical end manifolds

In general, when working on cylindrical end manifolds, one needs to watch

out for the following.

• Sobolev embeddings are no longer compact. For example, in dimension
4, there is an embedding W1,2 ֒→ L2 in the sense that the one norm
bounds the other, however this is not a compact embedding when the
base manifold Z is not compact. Fortunately for us, Struwe only uses
the compactness of such embeddings for compact intervals of the time
variable (e.g., [26, Proposition 5.2]).

We note also that there are various strategies for handling compactness-
type results on non-compact domains. For example, ﬁx a countable se-
quence of compact subsets Cn ⊂ Z that increase and exhaust Z. Then one
can appeal to compact embeddings on each Cn and then pass to a diago-
nal subsequence; see [7, Lemma 4.4.6]. However, as we just mentioned,
such strategies are not necessary here.

• In the non-compact case the space Lp does not include into Lq when q <
p (e.g., L∞ contains the constant functions which are not in Lq for any
q < ∞). A related issue is that the Sobolev embedding Wk+1,p ֒→ Wk,q
only holds at the critical level 1 − 4/p = −4/q, but not generally for
1 − 4/p > −4/q. (Of course, all of these embeddings do hold on compact
manifolds.) Once again, the situation is fortunate for us since Struwe
only uses the critical level embeddings; in particular he uses W1,2 ֒→ L4,
which is ﬁne for us.

23

• Fredholm theory on cylindrical end manifolds is a little trickier than for
closed manifolds. For example, one would want to know that the elliptic
operator

A,KdA,K

∆A,K = dA,Kd∗

A,K + d∗

is Fredholm. This is standard in the closed case, but in the presence of
cylindrical ends one needs this operator to have ‘good behavior’ along
the ends. For us, this ‘good behavior’ condition is satisﬁed since the K-
ﬂat connection a is assumed to be acyclic. See [6, Section 3] for a general
discussion.
As in the closed case, we also have that ∆A,K is self-adjoint; that is, inte-
gration by parts holds for dA,K. This is because of Axiom 0, together with
the fact that we have restricted to the space A1,2(P; a) so the domain of
dA,K consists of forms on P that vanish at inﬁnity. A nice corollary is that,
as in the closed case, the equation (∂τ + ∆A,K)V = 0, V(0) = V0 has a
unique solution V for each initial condition V0 ∈ W1,2. This is used to
solve for the background connection in [26, Section 4.1].

Consider, for the moment, the case when K = 0. Then with the above
bulleted comments in mind, Struwe’s proof of short-time existence carries over
to the cylindrical end setting with no essential change. It therefore remains to
discuss how to adapt his proof to accommodate perturbations.

Handling perturbations

Allowing for non-zero perturbations takes a little more work. There are
two potential issues here. One is algebraic, and the other is analytic. To un-
derstand the ﬁrst of these, note that the perturbed objects dA,K and FA,K are
not covariant derivatives and curvatures when K is non-zero. Nevertheless,
by Axiom 2, these behave algebraically like covariant derivatives and curva-
tures in the sense that they satisfy the conclusions of Corollary 2.3. That is,
essentially all of the algebra from Struwe’s proof carries over to our perturbed
setting with only minor changes in notation (here ‘algebra’ means anything
with an equal sign).

Now we discuss how to adapt Struwe’s analysis (anything with an inequal-
ity). To obtain Struwe’s weak solution, at various stages we need a W1,2-bound
on KA. This is furnished by Axiom 1, which implies that the W1,2-norm is
bounded by the energy of A. The energy is decreasing along the ﬂow, so this
bound can be taken to be independent of the ﬂow parameter.

In general, a good rule of thumb for accommodating for perturbations is
that any argument that holds for a Riemannian curvature terms (e.g., Rm#W),
will also hold for perturbation terms (e.g., KA#W).

To illustrate how all of this can be done, we revisit Struwe’s Lemmas 3.1-3.3,
which provide the crucial estimates used throughout his (and effectively our)
proof of short-time existence and uniqueness. To state the analogous results

24

for us, we assume a is an acyclic K-ﬂat connection, and A is a connection in
A1,2(P; a) (or A a path in A1,2(P; a), depending on context). We set

∆A,K := dA,Kd∗

A,K + d∗

A,KdA,K,

and we use ∇A to denote the full covariant derivative associated to A and the
Levi-Civita connection. For simplicity, we assume A is smooth.

Lemma 3.7. [26, Lemma 3.1] There is a constant CA so that

kWk2

W2,2(Z) ≤ CA(cid:16)k∆A,KWk2

L2(Z) + kWkL2(Z)(cid:17)

for all smooth forms W ∈ Ωi(Z, P(g)) with compact support. The constant CA de-
pends on A only through the value of kA − Are f kC 1(Z).

Proof. This is a standard Weitzenb ¨ock formula computation. In the perturbed
setting, the relevant Weitzenb ¨ock formula is

∇∗

A∇AW = ∆A,KW + FA,K#W + Rm#W

+dKA(d∗
A,KW) + dK∗
+KA#W + dKA(dK∗

A(dA,KW) + dA,K(dK∗
AW) + dK∗

A(dKAW),

AW) + d∗

A,K(dKAW)

where W is any smooth form on Z with compact support. The veriﬁcation of
this formula is simple: Just expand the perturbation terms on the right and
note that they all cancel to yield the usual unperturbed Weitzenb ¨ock formula.
Now Lemma 3.7 follows by taking the L2-norm of the above, and estimating
the lower order terms (e.g., use Axiom 1 for the perturbation terms). Since the
Sobolev norms are deﬁned relative to the reference connection Are f , one should
also use the estimate

kWkW2,2(Z) ≤ C(A)(cid:16)kWkL2(Z) + k∇∗

A∇AWkL2(Z)(cid:17) ,

where the constant depends on A through the norm kA − Are f kC 1(Z).

Lemma 3.8. [26, Lemma 3.3] There are constants C, δ > 0, independent of A, with
the following signiﬁcance. Suppose R > 0 is such that A satisﬁes

The metric term (Rm#W, W) is bounded since Z has bounded geometry. Simi-
larly, the assumptions on the perturbation K provide bounds of the form

kdKAWk2 ≤ CkWk2,

and

(KA#W, W) ≤ C′kWk2

for constants C, C′ independent of A. The condition on R is precisely what is
needed to estimate the FA-term using A-independent constants. See [26] for
more details here.

Using these lemmas, one can establish various regularity estimates for con-
nections along the ﬂow (13); e.g., those estimates in [26, Section 3.2]. For exam-
ple, write

k (∂τ + ∆A,K) Wk2

L2(L2) = k∂τWk2

L2(L2) + kWk2

L2(W2,2) + 2 (∂τW, ∆A,KW) .

Then Lemma 3.7 can be used to estimate the cross term, yielding the following.

Lemma 3.9. [26, Lemma 3.2] There is a constant C (independent of A) and a constant
τA > 0 (depending on A through kA − Are f kC 1(Z)), so that

k∂τWk2

L2(L2) + kWk2

L2(W2,2) ≤ C(cid:16)k (∂τ + ∆A,K) Wk2

L2(L2) + kW(0)kL2(Z)(cid:17)

for all smooth maps W : [0, τA] → Ωi(Z, P(g)) with image in the space of compactly
supported forms on Z.

Here the notation L2(L2) is short-hand for the space L2([0, τA] , L2(Z)) of
L2-maps from the interval [0, τA] into the Banach space of L2-forms on Z. The
notation L2(W2,2) is deﬁned similarly.

3.3 Proofs of short-time existence results

3.3.1 Proof of Theorem 3.1: Uniqueness and short-time existence

In light of the observations of the previous section, and since short-time exis-
tence in the closed case is well-treated in the literature (see [7, 26, 16, 11]), we

26

will only sketch the basic proof of Theorem 3.1, emphasizing the aspects that
are new to our situation. We refer primarily to the recent monograph [11] by
Feehan, since it is quite exhaustive and provides a nice overview of the various
approaches.

Remark 3.10. Though Feehan [11] has the closed, unperturbed case in mind, he ap-
peals to general results about ﬂows on Banach spaces (also discussed at length in [11]).
These general results apply to our setting for essentially the same reasons Struwe’s re-
sults do, as discussed in Section 3.2. Namely, the acyclic assumption on a implies that
the relevant function spaces are the Banach spaces Wk,p(Z), and the Laplacian ∆A,K
is symmetric and Fredholm on these spaces by Lemma 3.7.

The (now standard) ﬁrst step in establishing short-time existence for the
Yang-Mills ﬂow is to follow Donaldson’s variant of the ‘de Turck trick’. Here,
one ﬁrst solves the equation

∂τ B = −d∗

B,KFB,K − dB,Kd∗

B,K(B − Are f ),

B(0) = A0,

(19)

for a path B in A1,2(P; a), where Are f is the ﬁxed smooth reference connection.
A solution B to (19) exists on [0, τ1) for some τ1 > 0, and this solution has
regularity

B ∈ C 0(cid:16)[0, τ1) , A1,2(P; a) ∩ A2,p(P; a)(cid:17) ∩ C ∞ ((0, τ1) × Z) .

(20)

Moreover, if A0 is C ∞(Z), then it follows from a bootstrapping argument that
the ﬂow B is in C ∞ ([0, τ1) × Z). For a reference, see [11, Theorems 16.4, 16.5].
We note also that since all elements of A1,2(P; a) are irreducible, it follows
from the argument of [26, Section 6] that the solution B to (19) is unique. See
also [11, Section 19.2].

The next step is to transform our solution B from (19) into a solution of the

perturbed Yang-Mills ﬂow (13). To do this, solve the equation

u−1∂τu = −d∗

B,K(B − Are f ),

u(0) = e

(21)

for a gauge transformation u on Z. Given the regularity of B, this has a unique
solution u, with regularity

u ∈ C 0(cid:16)[0, τ1) , G1,p(P; e)(cid:17) ∩ C 1(cid:16)(0, τ1) , G1,p(P; e)(cid:17) .

Here we are using the assumption that p > 4 in order to obtain good Sobolev
multiplication results (e.g., a well-deﬁned gauge group). Moreover, if A0 is
C ∞(Z), then d∗
B,K(B − Are f ) is smooth, and so u is C ∞ on [0, τ1) × Z. See [11,
Lemma 19.1].

B(τ), and so the regularity on u, B give

We set A(τ) :=(cid:0)u(τ)−1(cid:1)∗

A ∈ C 0(cid:16)[0, τ1) , A0,p(P; a)(cid:17) ∩ C 1(cid:16)(0, τ1) , A0,p(P; a)(cid:17) .

well. To ﬁnish the proof, we need to work under the general hypothesis that
A0 ∈ A1,2 ∩ A2,p, and show that A and FA have the claimed regularity (14) and
(15), respectively.

Remark 3.11. (a) Note that the inhomogeneous term in (21) is smooth for positive
time, but not necessarily at time zero since B(0) = A0. Any irregularity of B at
time τ = 0 will likely lead to some sort of irregularity of u(τ) and hence A(τ), even
for positive τ. This is to be expected, given the observation that the ﬂow (13) is not
smoothing; see Remark 3.2 (a).

(b) If A0 only has regularity W1,2, then it is at this stage that the proof breaks down.
This is because one can only show that u is a gauge transformation in G0,2(P; e), which
is neither a Lie group, nor does it act on the space of connections. Struwe [26] handles
this by taking a slightly different approach than sketched here, wherein he replaces the
ﬁxed reference connection Are f (which is constant in τ) with a smooth τ-dependent
‘background’ connection. See Remark 3.2 (b).

Gauge equivariance of the curvature and covariant derivative give

FA,K = Ad(u)FB,K,

A,KFA,K = Ad(u)d∗
d∗

B,KFB,K.

The connection B is smooth for positive time, and u is continuous, so this shows
that FA,K and d∗
A,KFA,K are in C 0((0, τ0) × Z). (The same conclusion holds in
the absence of the perturbation.) We claim that this allows us to interpret

∂τ(A − Are f ) = −d∗

A,KFA,K

as an equation in C 0((0, τ1) × Z). Indeed, a priori this is only an equation in
Lp, due to the weak regularity we have on A. However, since the right-hand
side is continuous, this shows A ∈ C 1((0, τ1), C 0(Z)), as claimed.

Now we continue the bootstrapping. The C 1-regularity on FA that was

claimed in the statement of Theorem 3.1 follows from the identities

∂τ FA = Ad(u−1∂τu)FA + Ad(u)∂τ FB,

AFA − ∗hAre f − A ∧ ∗FAi

FA = d∗

dAre f FA = hA − Are f ∧ Ad(u)FAi ,

since the right-hand side of each is continuous in all variables. Of course, sim-
ilar computations hold in the presence of a perturbation.

Moving on to the spatial derivatives of A, we write

∂τdAre f (A − Are f ) = ∂τ(cid:18)FA − FAre f −

2hA − Are f ∧ A − Are fi(cid:19) .

28

The above observations show that the right-hand side is continuous. Similarly
∂τd∗

(A − Are f ) is continuous. Combining these gives

Are f

A ∈ C 1((0, τ1) × Z).

Now we will verify that A is continuous at τ = 0 in the W1,2(Z)-topology.

3.3.2 Proof of Propositions 3.3 and 3.4: Energy concentration and bubble

formation

Suppose A(τ) is a solution of (13) on [0, τ1) with the regularity of Theorem 3.1.
Let δ > 0 be as in the statement of Lemma 3.8. It follows from Lemmas 3.8 and
3.9 that if there is some R > 0 with

sup

z∈Z, 0≤τ<τ1ZBR(z)

|FA(τ),K|2 < δ

then A(τ) can be continuously extended to τ = τ1 (hence extended for a pos-
itive time past τ1, as well); see [26, Lemma 3.6] for a proof. In particular, the
quantity τ from the statement of Proposition 3.3 does indeed characterize the
maximal existence time.

Suppose now that we are in the setting where energy concentration occurs,
and deﬁne τ ∈ (0, ∞] as in Proposition 3.3. Now the remaining assertions of
Propositions 3.3 and 3.4 follow essentially the same rescaling argument given
by Schlatter [24]. We summarize the details.

Fix sequences τn, Rn as in the statement of Proposition 3.4. Then ﬁnd zn ∈ Z

where the quantity

ZBRn (zn)

|FA(τn),K|2

(24)

is maximized (the curvature decays on the cylindrical ends, so there do indeed
exist such zn). Due to the non-compactness of Z, there are two cases to consider.

Case 1: The zn are contained in a compact subset of Z.

Case 2: The zn are not contained in any compact subset of Z.

In Case 1, we can pass to a subsequence and assume the zn converge to
some z01 ∈ Z. Now deﬁne the sequence An of connections by rescaling around
z01 as described in Proposition 3.4. Uhlenbeck’s compactness theorem implies
that the An converge, in the sense described in Proposition 3.4, to some limiting
connection A∞ on R4 with ﬁnite energy. The ﬂow equation (13) rescales in such
a way to imply that A∞ is Yang-Mills.

Remark 3.13. The rescaling is also such that the perturbation term vanishes in the
limit, so A∞ is Yang-Mills in the usual sense; this uses the assumption from Axiom 1
that KA is uniformly bounded in Lp. This type of rescaling is carried out explicitly in
Section 4.1.

By removal of singularities, A∞ extends to a ﬁnite-energy Yang-Mills con-
nection on some bundle over S4. Let ηS4 > 0 denote the inﬁmum of all such
energy values (this is indeed positive, see Section 4.1). The conformal invari-
ance of the energy justiﬁes the appearance of ηS4 in (16).

Of course, it is possible that there are multiple points zn where (24) is max-
imized. Repeating the above to all such sequences that are contained in some
compact subset of Z, we obtain a sequence

z01, z02, . . . , z0K0

31

of bubbling points in Z. There are only a ﬁnite number K0 of such points be-
cause each Yang-Mills bubble has energy at least ηS4 , and the energy along the
ﬂow is no greater than the energy of A0. This ﬁnishes the analysis for Case 1.

In Case 2, we can pass to a subsequence and assume zn ∈ [0, ∞) × Y is on
the cylindrical end for all n. Then we can write zn = (sn, yn) in coordinates,
and assume further that the yn converge to some yj1; where j > 0 is an indexing
integer that will be speciﬁed at the end. Since the zn are not contained in any
compact subset of Z, it follows that

sn − s′
n.

If sn goes to inﬁnity faster (resp. slower) than s′
n, then we want to think of j as
being ‘greater than’ (resp. ‘smaller than’) j′, and we set k := 1. Find a function
sj′ (τ) with sj′ (τn) = s′
n, and set sj′1 := 0. Repeating with all such sequences, we
arrive at the set of bubbling points described in Proposition 3.3. Once again,
there can only be a ﬁnite number of bubbling points, and hence a ﬁnite number
J of rates at which these bubbles escape down the cylindrical end. Once all of
these bubbling points have been identiﬁed, precise values for the indices j, j′,
etc. can be given according to this ‘greater than/less than’ procedure.

3.3.3 Proof of Proposition 3.5: Convergence with ﬁnite-time bubbling

First we will prove L2(Z)-convergence of A(τ) as τ increases to τ < ∞. We
begin with a few simple computations. The ﬂow equation gives

The W1,2

Schlatter’s argument for the proof of [24, Theorem 1.2 (i)], which is local in
nature and hence not sensitive to the cylindrical ends.

Finally, we establish the energy inequality (18). For this, let τn, Rn be as in
the statement of Proposition 3.4; we may assume the τn are increasing, and the
Rn are small. Consider the complement

Zn := Z\[j,k

4 Long-time existence and convergence at inﬁnite

time

Fix a perturbation K as well as an acyclic K-ﬂat connection a on Q. Throughout
this section, we assume K satisﬁes the conclusions of Theorem 2.13.

In Section 2.2.3, we associated to a an index IndP,K(a) ∈ Z, deﬁned as the
index of a natural Fredholm operator. Our long-time existence result below
relies on a certain restriction of this index. To state this restriction, we consider
the extended real number

IG := inf
R→S4

nG |κ(R)| ,

where the inﬁmum is over all principal G-bundles R → S4 for which κ(R) 6= 0.
Here nG > 0 is the constant from (11) and κ(R) is the characteristic number
from Section 2.2.1. The signiﬁcance of IG is that bubbling cannot occur in any
K-ASD moduli space of dimension smaller than IG; see the end of Section
2.2.2 for more details on this moduli space. See also [1, Section 8] for a similar
discussion for general G.

Example 4.1. (a) Suppose G = SU(r). Then IG = 4r.

(b) Suppose G = PU(r). Then IG = 4r. In the notation of Example 2.4 (d),
this can be seen by noting that each PU(r)-bundle R → S4 lifts to an SU(r)-bundle
R′ → S4, and q1(R) = 2rc2(R′).

In general, when G is abelian, we have IG = ∞ since κ(R) = 0 for all R.
When G is not abelian, it follows from Lemma 2.5 that IG ∈ (0, ∞) is ﬁnite and
positive.

With these preliminaries, we can state the main result.

Theorem 4.2. Fix a perturbation K, and assume this satisﬁes the conclusion of Theo-
rem 2.13. Suppose a ∈ A(Q) is a K-ﬂat connection with the property that

IndK,P(a) < IG.

Then there is some η(a) > 0 (depending on a, Z, the bundle, the metric, and the
perturbation) so the following holds.

34

Fix p > 4, as well as A0 ∈ A1,2(P; a) ∩ A2,p(P; a), and let A be the solution to

the ﬂow (13) from Theorem 3.1. If the initial condition A0 satisﬁes

kF+

A0,Kk2

L2(Z)

< η(a),

then the solution A exists for all time τ ∈ [0, ∞), with the regularity asserted in
Theorem 3.1. Moreover, for each 2 ≤ q ≤ 4 the A(τ) converge exponentially in
W1,q(Z), as τ approaches ∞, to a unique K-ASD connection A∞ ∈ A1,q(P; a).

In Section 4.1, we give a fairly concrete deﬁnition of the constant η(a) from
the theorem. The proof of Theorem 4.2 occupies Sections 4.2 (long-time exis-
tence) and 4.3 (inﬁnite-time convergence). Our basic analytic arguments for
the proof closely follow those of [24, 23, 28]. See also Feehan’s book [11] for a
thorough treatment of the asymptotics of the ﬂow in the absence of perturba-
tions.

The relevance of convergence in W1,q(Z) for 2 < q ≤ 4 is that it ensures
A∞ is G2,q-gauge equivalent to a smooth connection (e.g., apply Uhlenbeck
compactness to the constant sequence An := A∞).

4.1 A positive energy gap

Let nG be as in (11). It will be clear from the proof of Theorem 4.2 that the
constant η(a) appearing in its statement can be taken to be the minimum of the
numbers 1, 1/nG and the following three numbers:

A. The inﬁmum

inf
A

kF+

A k2

L2(S4).

Here the inﬁmum ranges over all connections A on any principal G-bundle
over S4 that are Yang-Mills, not ASD, and satisfy YM(A) ≤ CS K,P(a) + 1.

B. The inﬁmum

inf
A

kF+

A,Kk2

L2(Z).

Here the inﬁmum ranges over all connections A on P that are K-YM, not
K-ASD, and satisfy YMK(A) ≤ CS K,P(a) + 1.

C. The inﬁmum

inf
A

kF+

A,KY k2

L2(R×Y).

Here the inﬁmum ranges over all connections A on R × Q that are KY-YM,
not KY-ASD, and satisfy YMKY (A) ≤ CS K,P(a) + 1.

For the quantity in C, the perturbation KY is the translationally-invariant per-
turbation on R × Q from Remark 2.2. The metric on R × Y is ds2 + gY.

The next theorem justiﬁes this choice of η(a) by stating that each of the in-
ﬁma in A-C is positive. In light of the identity (9), this positivity can be viewed

35

as saying that the perturbed Yang-Mills functional has a positive energy gap
above the minimum energy level given by the anti-self dual connections. (Of
course, this minimum energy level is only a theoretical lower bound, since ASD
connections may not exist.)

Theorem 4.3. The quantities in A, B, and C are positive.

Proof. The proof we present follows a strategy suggested to us by Chris Wood-
ward. It relies on two simple observations.

Observation 1. Suppose A is K-YM on Z. Then the self-dual part F+
orthogonal to the image im d+
ASD, then this self-dual part is non-zero and so the cohomology group

A.K is L2-
A,K ⊂ Ω+(Z, P(g)). If, in addition, A is not K-

H+

A,K := Ω+(Z, P(g))/im d+

A,K

is non-trivial.

The same observation holds when Z is interpreted as S4 or R × Y, and
when K is interpreted as zero or KY, respectively. (That is, the situations of
A, B, and C are all covered.)

Observation 2. Suppose A is K-ASD on Z. Then there is some constant CA so
that

kWkW1,2(Z) ≤ CAkd∗

A,KWkL2(Z) = CAkdA,KWkL2(Z)

(27)

for all self-dual 2-forms W ∈ Ω+(Z, P(g)).

To see (27), we note that our assumptions on K imply that A is ASD-

regular. This means the operator

d+
A,K : W1,2(Ω1) −→ L2(Ω+)

is surjective. Equivalently, this implies the formal adjoint

d∗
A,K : W1,2(Ω+) −→ L2(Ω1).

is injective. Then (27) follows because the formal adjoint d∗
A,K has closed
image (this uses the non-degeneracy of the K-ﬂat connection to which A is
asymptotic; see [6, Chapter 3]). Note that (27) implies

H+

A,K = 0

for all K-ASD connections A. The same holds with Z and K interpreted as
R × Y and KY, respectively, so this address the situations in B and C.

The analogous estimate (27) for the situation in A is a bit different, since
we are not working with a perturbation on S4 and cannot use it to ensure
the ASD-regular condition holds. Nevertheless, the condition does hold
due to the symmetries of S4. Indeed, suppose A is an anti-self dual con-
nection on a bundle over S4. Then the Weitzenb ¨ock formula [13, Equation
(6.26)] reads

2d∗

AdAW = ∇∗

A∇AW + 4W.

36

for self-dual 2-forms W, where ∇A is the covariant derivative obtained by
tensoring the Levi-Civita connection on S4 with A. The relevance here is
that ∇A is injective, and so there is some constant C such that

kWkL2(S4) ≤ Ck∇AWkL2(S4)

for all self-dual W. Combining this with the Weitzenb ¨ock formula, we have

kWk2

L2(S4) ≤ C2(cid:16)2kdAWk2

L2(S4) − 4kWk2

L2(S4)(cid:17) ≤ 2C2kdAWk2

L2(S4),

which implies dA is injective. Since dA has closed image in the relevant
Sobolev completions, it follows that

kWkW1,2(S4) ≤ CAkdAWkL2(S4),

which is the S4-version of (27).

Remark 4.4. Given a ﬁxed energy bound E, the constant CA from (27) can be chosen
to be independent of the K-ASD connection A, provided YMK(A) ≤ E. This is be-
cause of the following. First, the constant CA depends only on the gauge equivalence
class of A. Second, the moduli space of ﬁxed-energy K-ASD connections has a com-
pactiﬁcation in terms of broken trajectories and bubbles. Lastly, Floer’s gluing theorem
shows that if (27) holds for each connection in a broken trajectory-with-bubbles, then
it holds for any connection sufﬁciently Uhlenbeck-close to that broken trajectory-with-
bubbles.

We will use the above observations to prove that the quantity in B is posi-
tive; the quantities in A and C are essentially special cases, given the observa-
tions above.

We argue by contradiction. If the quantity in B is zero, then we can ﬁnd
a sequence of An of smooth K-YM connections An satisfying YMK(An) ≤
CS K,P(a) + 1 and F+
An,K 6= 0, but with the property that the self-dual curvatures
are converging to zero

kF+

An,KkL2(Z) −→ 0.

(28)

Since each of these has ﬁnite energy, it follows that there are K-ﬂat connections
an with An ∈ A1,2(P; an). To simplify the discussion, we assume an = a for all
n. The general case reduces to this one by the gauge invariance of the problem,
the uniform energy bound on the An, and the fact that there are only ﬁnitely
many gauge equivalence classes of K-ﬂat connections.

We split our analysis up into cases according to whether bubbles form.

Case 1: supn kFAn kL∞(Z)

< ∞ (no bubbles form)

In this case, we appeal to the Uhlenbeck Compactness Theorem 2.9. Then
by passing to a subsequence and composing with suitable gauge transforma-
tions, we may assume the An converge in C ∞ to a broken K-ASD trajectory
(A0; B1, . . . , BJ) asymptotic to a (this is K-ASD by (28)). By Floer’s gluing the-
orem [12] (see Remark 2.12), we can ﬁnd a second sequence A′
n ∈ A1,p(P; a)

37

of K-ASD connections that converge to the same broken trajectory. Then it
follows from Corollary 2.11 and the triangle inequality, that

kAn − A′

By Observation 1, we have H+

By Remark 4.4, this constant CA′

hand side is going to zero by (29). This is a contradiction, and so we are ﬁnished
with the analysis of Case 1.
Case 2: supn kFAn kL∞(Z) = ∞ (bubbles form)

Find points zn ∈ Z with

c2
n := |FAn(zn)| = kFAn kL∞(Z).

After possibly passing to a subsequence, we may assume cn → ∞. There are
two further cases to consider.

Subcase 1: There is some compact set C ⊂ Z with zn ∈ C for all n.

Subcase 2: The zn are not contained in any compact set in Z.

Subcase 2 reduces to Subcase 1 as follows. By passing to a subsequence,
we may assume zn ∈ [0, ∞) × Y for all n. Relative to these coordinates, write
zn = (sn, yn). By translating by sn, we may view zn as the point in R × Y with
coordinates (0, yn). This recovers Subcase 1 with Z = R × Y and C = {0} × Y.
It will be clear from the proof of Subcase 1 below, that this translating process
does not effect the argument.

We will therefore be done if we can show that Subcase 1 leads to a contra-
diction. We may pass to a subsequence and assume the zn converge to some
z∞ ∈ Z. Fix a contractible ball B(z∞) ⊂ Z containing z∞. For simplicity, we as-
sume the radius is 1. By restricting to B(z∞), we may view each An as a K-YM
connections on the unit ball B1(0) ⊂ R4 in Euclidean space, relative to the met-
ric g pulled back from Z. Comparing these restrictions to the trivial connection
d on R4, we can write

An = d +

4
∑
i=1

Bn,i dxi

for some functions Bn,i : B1(0) → g. For each n, deﬁne a new connection A′

n by

A′

n(x) = d + c−1
n

4
∑
i=1

Bn,i(c−1

Then A′
the perturbation is

n is a Kn-YM connection on Bcn(0) ⊂ R4 relative to a metric gn. Here

Kn := c−2

n K

which is converging uniformly to zero. The metric gn is given by conformally
scaling g about 0; in particular, the gn are converging to the ﬂat Euclidean met-
ric.

By conformal invariance, the connection A′

n has energy less than YMK(An),

which we have assumed is uniformly bounded. We also have

kF+
A′

n,Kn

kL2(Bcn (0)) −→ 0.

However, the L∞ norms normalize to give

kFA′

n

kL∞(Bcn (0)) = |FA′

n(0)| = 1.

Now we effectively repeat the argument from Case 1 on the non-compact man-
ifold R4. Uhlenbeck’s compactness theorem together with the L∞-bound im-
plies we can pass to a subsequence and apply suitable gauge transformations
so that the A′
n converge in C ∞ on compact subsets of R4 to some limiting ﬁnite-
energy ASD connection A′
∞ on R4 (there is no perturbation in the deﬁning
equation, and the metric is the Euclidean one). We note that this convergence
implies that there is some constant C so that, for each compact set B ⊂ R4, we
have

kA′

n − A′

∞kL∞(B) ≤ C

(30)

provided n is large enough so Bcn(0) ⊂ B. That this bound is independent of
the compact set B chosen follows because the An are uniformly bounded on
the boundary of the ball B(z∞), and so the A′
n|∂Bcn (0) decay uniformly to the
trivial connection as n goes to inﬁnity.

To obtain a contradiction, consider the self-dual 2-forms

Wn := F+
A′

n,Kn

/kF+
A′

n,Kn

kL2(Bcn (0)).

Since A′
these satisfy

n is not Kn-ASD, this is well-deﬁned. However, since A′

n is Kn-YM,

dA′

n,KnWn = 0.

The uniform bound in (30) combines with the convergence of the Kn to zero
to imply that the Wn are uniformly bounded in W1,2 on compact subsets of
R4, and this bound is independent of the compact set chosen. Using a bump
function, we can extend Wn to a self-dual 2-form on S4 so that

kWnkW1,2(S4)

< ∞.

sup

n

39

Then the Wn converge strongly in L2 on all of S4 to some limiting self-dual form
W∞. This is non-zero since

1 = kWnkL2(Bcn (0)) ≤ kWnkL2(S4).

Finally, since A∞ is a ﬁnite-energy ASD connection on R4, it has a unique ex-
tension to a ﬁnite-energy ASD connection on S4. We plainly have

which contradicts Observation 2 since W∞ 6= 0.

dA∞W∞ = 0,

4.2 Long-time existence

In this section and the next, we will repeatedly use fact that the L2(Z)-norms
of FA,K and F+
A,K are non-increasing along the ﬂow. Indeed, the relation (9) and
the ﬂow (13) give

d
dτ

kF+

A(τ),Kk2

L2(Z) =

d
dτ

YMK(A(τ)) = −kd∗

A,KFA,Kk2

L2(Z).

(31)

Now we turn to establishing the long-time existence assertions of Theorem
4.2. By Theorem 3.1, there is some maximal time τ ∈ (0, ∞] for which the ﬂow
starting at A0 ∈ A1,2(P; a) exists for all τ ∈ [0, τ). Our goal in this section is to
show that, under the hypotheses of Theorem 4.2, we have τ = ∞.

If τ1 := τ is ﬁnite, then it follows from Proposition 3.5 and Remark 3.6,
that there is some bundle P1 → Z, a gauge transformation u1 on Q, and a
connection

A1 ∈ A1,2(P1, u∗

1 a)

so that the A(τ) converge to a pullback of A1, and

{energy of bubbles} + YMK(A1) ≤ YMK(A0).

In fact, we can say a little more: We have assumed that kF+
L2(Z) is no
greater than the constant η(a). This L2-norm is non-increasing along the ﬂow,
and is conformally invariant. In particular, it follows from A in the deﬁnition
of η(a) that each Yang-Mills bubble is in fact ASD. Energy quantization for
ASD connections on S4 implies that each has energy at least IG/nG (these con-
stants were discussed before the statement of Theorem 4.2). In particular, the
assumption that at least one bubble forms implies

A0,Kk2

IG/nG + YMK(A1) ≤ YMK(A0).

(32)

Now we want to start the ﬂow over again, but with initial condition A1 in
place of A0. However, from what we have at this point, it may not be the case
that A1 has enough regularity to apply the Short-Time Existence Theorem 3.1.
Nevertheless, for the argument that follows, it sufﬁces to replace A1 by any

40

1 in A1,2(P1, u∗

smooth connection A′
1 is no greater
than the energy of A1. Such connections always exist. For example, take A′
1
to be any connection along Donaldson’s ﬂow (19) with initial condition A1.
This ﬂow is smoothing, and the second Bianchi identity shows that it is energy
non-increasing.

1 a), provided the energy of A′

In summary, we may therefore assume that A1 is a smooth connection in
A1,2(P1, u∗
1 a) satisfying (32). Now repeat the above procedure with A1 in place
of A0. Continuing inductively, there are a number of times τ1, . . . , τ L at which
bubbles can form. Associated to each τℓ is a gauge transformation uℓ, a bundle
Pℓ, and a smooth connection Aℓ ∈ A1,2(Pℓ, u∗

ℓ a) satisfying

ℓIG/nG + YMK(Ak) ≤ YMK(A0).

This shows that there can be only ﬁnitely many such times L ≥ 1 at which
bubbles form. Then the ﬂow starting at AL exists for all time. We will denote
this ﬂow by A(τ), with the understanding that it is valid for τ ≥ τ L.

Now we wish to take the inﬁnite-time limit. Towards this end, we make the

following claim.

Claim 1. There is a gauge transformation uL+1 on Q, and a broken K-ASD trajectory
(AL+1; B1, . . . , BJ) that is asymptotic to u∗

L+1a, and satisﬁes

YMK(AL+1) +

J
∑
j=1

YMKY (Bj) ≤ YMK(AL).

(Note that the analysis from Proposition 3.5 is no longer valid in the inﬁnite-
time regime.) To prove the claim, we ﬁx a sequence τn → ∞, and appeal to
Uhlenbeck’s weak compactness theorem applied to the sequence A(τn); see
Remark 2.10 (a). This sequence converges weakly in W1,p
loc (Z\B), modulo gauge
and on the complement of some ﬁnite bubbling set B ⊂ Z, to a connection

AL+1 ∈ A1,p

loc(cid:16)P|Z\B(cid:17) .

By standard inﬁnite-time analysis for ﬂows, it follows that AL+1 is K-YM on
the complement of the bubbling set B. It also satisﬁes the energy bound

YMK(AL+1) ≤ YMK(A0) = CS K,P(a) + kF+
A0

k2
L2(Z)

< CS K,P(a) + η(a).

This implies two things. First, AL+1 has ﬁnite energy, and so extends over B by
removal of singularities. Second, we have deﬁned η(a) so that η(a) ≤ 1; hence
YMK(AL+1) < CS K,P(a) + 1. The relevance of this latter estimate becomes
clear when coupled with the bound

kF+

AL+1,Kk2

L2(Z) ≤ lim inf
τ→∞

kF+

A(τ),Kk2

L2(Z) ≤ kF+

A0,Kk2

L2(Z)

< η(a).

41

For then, it follows from B in the deﬁnition of η(a) that AL+1 must actually be
K-ASD.

Since AL+1 has ﬁnite-energy, it is asymptotic to some K-ﬂat connection a1.
If a1 is gauge equivalent to a, then we are done with the proof of the claim.
Otherwise, by performing suitable translations on the cylindrical end (see Sec-
tion 2.3, and the references therein), and repeating the above argument, we can
complete AL+1 to a broken K-YM trajectory (AL+1; B1, . . . , BJ), with BJ asymp-
totic, modulo gauge, to a. That each Bj is actually KY-ASD follows from the
same argument we used to show AL+1 is K-ASD; this time one should use C
in place of B. This ﬁnishes the proof of Claim 1.

With Claim 1 in hand, we now have

IG/nG + YMK(AL+1) +

J
∑
j=1

YMKY (Bj) ≤ YMK(A0)

< CS K,P(a) + η(a)

(33)

≤ CS K,P(a) + 1/nG.

In the last line we used another deﬁning condition on η(a) from Section 4.1.
We will now focus on the energies appearing on the left.

Since these connections are anti-self dual, these energies are topological.
To compute these energies, let a1 be the asymptotic limit of AL+1, and aj the
asymptotic limit of Bj at +∞; hence aJ = u∗
L+1a. Then since AL+1 is K-ASD,
we have

YMK(AL+1) = CS K,P(a0).

The version of this for Bj is

YMKY (Bj) = CS K(aj−1, aj),

where CS K(b−, b+) is the perturbed Chern-Simons functional for R × Q with
asymptotics at ±∞ given by b±. These Chern-Simons functionals are deﬁned
by integrals and so are additive in their arguments

CS K,P(a) + CS K(a, b) = CS K,P(b),

CS K(a, b) + CS K(b, c) = CS K(a, c).

This gives

L+1a) is the expected dimension
of the moduli space MASD(u∗
L+1a; K) of K-ASD connections that are asymp-
totic to u∗
L+1a. We have assumed that K is ASD-regular, which in particular
means that all non-empty moduli space are smooth and of the expected dimen-
sion. It follows from Floer’s gluing theorem applied to the broken trajectory

that there is some K-ASD connection in A1,p(P; u∗

sion. This proves the claim.

L+1a) is non-empty, and must therefore have non-negative dimen-

This concludes our argument for long-time existence. Note that this same

argument also excludes bubbling at inﬁnite time.

4.3 Inﬁnite-time convergence

Here we complete the proof of Theorem 4.2 by showing that A(τ) converges,
in the sense described, as τ → ∞. Of course, we may assume that A(τ) is not
K-YM for any τ, since otherwise it would be constant in τ by uniqueness, and
we would be done.

It follows from the analysis of the previous section that no bubbling can
form along the ﬂow. The argument also shows that the ﬂow converges, modulo
gauge, at inﬁnite time to a broken K-ASD trajectory. In this section we reﬁne
this by showing the ﬂow A(τ) converges at inﬁnite time on all of Z to an actual
K-ASD connection A ∈ A1,2(P; a) ∩ A1,4(P; a). We do this in several steps.

Step 1. supτ≥1 kFA(τ),KkL∞(Z)

< ∞.

If such a uniform bound did not exist, then there would be a non-ﬂat Yang-
Mills bubble on S4 (actually, it would have to be ASD since F+
A(τ) is L2-small).
However, as we saw in Section 4.2, the energy and index assumptions do not
allow this to happen.

43

Step 2. Fix s < ∞. Then there is some CPI > 0 so that the following Poincar´e
inequality holds for all τ ≥ 0:

kF+

A(τ),KkLs(Z) ≤ CPIkdA(τ),KF+

A(τ),KkLs(Z).

(35)

Fix τ. Since A(τ) is not K-YM, the existence of a constant C = C(τ) satisfy-
ing (35) is obvious. It sufﬁces to show that this constant does not diverge as τ
approaches ∞. If this were the case, then we could ﬁnd a sequence τn diverging
to ∞ with

kdA(τn),KWnkLs(Z) → 0,

where we have set

Wn := F+

A(τn),K/kF+

A(τn),KkLs(Z).

The proof now is very similar to that of Theorem 4.3. Namely, by Uhlenbeck’s
compactness theorem, it follows that there are gauge transformation un so that
the u∗

n A(τn) converge to a broken K-YM trajectory

(A0; B1, . . . , BJ)

that is asymptotic to u∗a for some gauge transformation u. We assume, for
simplicity, that u is the identity. Just as in Section 4.2, the index assumption
on a implies that this is actually a broken K-ASD trajectory. In particular, by
Floer’s gluing theorem (see Remark 2.12) we can ﬁnd a sequence A′
n of K-ASD
connections in A(P; a) that converge to this broken trajectory in the sense of
Theorem 2.9. Then Corollary 2.11 implies

kA(τn) − A′

nkL∞(Z) −→ 0,

after possibly applying suitable gauge transformations to the A′
tions on K imply that each of these A′
is a uniform constant C so that

n. The assump-
n is ASD-regular, so by Remark 4.4, there

1 = kWnkLs(Z) ≤ CkdA′

n,KWnkLs(Z)

≤ CkdA(τn),KWnkLs(Z) + CkA(τn) − A′

nkL∞(Z).

(Strictly speaking, Remark 4.4 is only stated for s = 2, but the estimate holds
for all s < ∞ by standard Fredholm theory.) The right-hand side is going to
zero, so this contradiction ﬁnishes the proof of Step 2.

Step 3. The A(τ) converge exponentially in L2(Z) to some connection A∞ ∈ A0,2(P; a).

Use the ﬂow (13), together with the estimate (35) to get

Combining this with (26) gives

kA(τb) − A(τa)kL2(Z) ≤ |τb − τa|Be−2τa/C2
PI ,

which holds for all 0 ≤ τa ≤ τb. Fix τ ≥ 0 and use the above repeatedly with
τa = τ + j and τb = τ + j + 1, for 0 ≤ j ≤ J − 1, to get

kA(τ + J) − A(τ)kL2(Z) ≤

This type of argument shows that {A(τ)}τ is Cauchy and so converges in L2
to some limiting connection A∞ with the same K-ﬂat limits as the A(τ). This
argument also shows exponential convergence in L2:

(37)

This completes the proof of Step 3.

Our goal now is to bootstrap from L2-convergence to the higher Sobolev
convergence claimed in the statement of Theorem 4.2. This will call for higher
order versions of the estimates above. To simplify the discussion, for the rest
of the proof we treat the perturbation K as being zero, and drop it from the
notation. Axiom 1 provides the estimates necessary to extend these arguments
to the case where K is non-zero.

Step 4. For each 2 ≤ s ≤ 4, there is some C so that the following holds for all τ ≥ 1:

kdA(τ)F+

A(τ)kLs(Z) ≤ Ckd+

A(τ)dA(τ)F+

A(τ)kL2(Z).

45

We will prove the statement for s = 4. The proof for s = 2 is similar, and

the result for general 2 ≤ s ≤ 4 follows by interpolation.

Our strategy is to use a contradiction argument similar to the one in Step 2.

That is, we assume there is a sequence τn diverging to ∞ with

kd+

A(τn)d∗

A(τn)WnkL2(Z) −→ 0,

where we have set

Wn := F+

A(τn)/kdA(τn)F+

A(τn)kL4(Z).

As in Step 2, it follows from Uhlenbeck’s compactness theorem and Theorem
2.11 that there are ASD connections A′

n ∈ A(P; a) so that

kA(τn) − A′

nkL∞(Z) + kA(τn) − A′

nkW1,4(Z) = 0.

Then we have

Thus

n

WnkL4(Z) + CPIkA(τn) − A′

nkL∞(Z),

(38)

where CPI is the constant from Step 2 with s = 4.

Integration by parts shows that d+

A is always injective on the image of ∗dA|Ω+ .

Indeed, suppose W is a self-dual 2-form with d+

A ∗ dAW = 0. Then

0 = (d+

A ∗ dAW, W) = (dA ∗ dAW, W) = (∗dAW, d∗

In particular, by the Fredholm property for dAn, there is some constant C so

that

46

together with H ¨older estimates. The L4-norms of Wn and dA′
bounded, so we can continue the above as

nWn are uniformly

1 ≤ C′(cid:16)kd+

A(τn) ∗ dA(τn)WnkL2(Z) + kA(τn) − A′

nkL∞(Z) + kA′

The right-hand side is going to zero. This contradiction establishes Step 4.

Step 5. The connections A(τ) converge exponentially in L4(Z) to A∞.

We will show that A(τ) is Cauchy in A0,4(P; a) as τ approaches ∞. Ulti-
mately we will establish a second-order version of Step 3 (the full second order
version is Step 6, below). All unspeciﬁed norms are L2(Z).

We begin by establishing some preliminary estimates. Differentiating and

We therefore have

L4(Z) ≤ |τb − τa|Z τb

τa

kd+

A ∗ dAF+

A k2 dτ

≤ C′′|τb − τa|e−2cτa,

provided τa is sufﬁciently large. As in Step 3, this implies that A(τ) is Cauchy
in L4(Z), and converges exponentially in L4(Z); the limit is necessarily A∞.

Step 6. The connections A(τ) converge exponentially in W1,2(Z) to A∞.

All unspeciﬁed norms are L2(Z). Recall the Sobolev norms are deﬁned

relative to the ﬁxed reference connection Are f . Therefore

sufﬁces to show

Remark 4.5. The justiﬁcation for the exchange of the derivative and the integral is as

and a path of gauge transformation of class

u ∈ C 1((0, ∞), G1,p(P; e) ∩ G1,2(P; e))

so that u∗ A = B. Here p > 4 is as in the statement of Theorem 4.2. Then

The last inequality follows by the exponential convergence that was estab-
lished in Step 5.

Step 7. For 1 ≤ s < ∞, the A(τ) converge exponentially in Ls(Z) to A∞.

Since 1 ≤ s < ∞, we have 2 ≤ 4s/(s + 1) < 4, and so

W1,2(Z) ∩ W1,4(Z) ⊂ W1,4s/(s+1)(Z) ⊂ Ls(Z)

These embeddings involve constants that are independent of the connection
used to deﬁne the Sobolev norms, and are valid even though Z is non-compact.
As we saw earlier, d+
A is injective on the image of ∗dA|Ω+ . Together with the
embeddings above, it follows that there is a bound of the form

kdAWkLs(Z) ≤ C(cid:16)kd+

A ∗ dAWkL2(Z) + kd+

A ∗ dAWkL4(Z)(cid:17)

for all self-dual 2-forms W, and all connections A = A(τ) along the ﬂow. We
also have that dA is injective on the image of d+
A, and so we can convert away
from the L4-norm to get

kdAWkLs(Z) ≤ C′(cid:16)kd+

A ∗ dAWkL2(Z) + kdAd+

A ∗ dAWkL2(Z)(cid:17)

for a constant that is independent of W and τ.

Now turning to the problem at hand, take the norm of (22), and use the

We will establish this for q = 4; the remaining values of q follow by inter-

polation and Step 6.

The analysis is very similar to Step 6, so we will be brief. Begin by writing
