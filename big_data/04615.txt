Recent techniques and results on the

Erd˝os–P´osa property∗

Jean-Florent Raymond†‡§

Dimitrios M. Thilikos§¶

Abstract

Several min-max relations in graph theory can be expressed in the framework of
Erd˝os–P´osa properties. Typically, such properties reveal a connection between
packing and covering problems on graphs. We describe some recent techniques
for proving such properties that are related to tree-like decompositions. We also
provide an uniﬁed presentation of the current state of the art on this topic.

Keywords: Erd˝os–P´osa property, min-max theorems, tree decompositions, tree par-
titions, girth, graph minors, topological minors, graph immersions.

Introduction

A considerable part of combinatorics has been developed around min-max theorems.
Min-max theorems usually identify dualities between certain objects in graphs, hyper-
graphs, and other combinatorial structures. The target is to prove that the absence
of the primal object implies the presence of the dual one and vice versa.

A classic example of such a duality is Menger’s theorem: the primal concept is the
existence of k internally disjoint paths between two vertex sets S and T of a graph
G, while the dual concept is a collection of k vertices that intersect all (S, T )-paths.
Another example is K˝onig’s theorem where the primal notion is the existence of a
matching of k vertices in a bipartite graph and the dual one is the existence of a
vertex cover of size k. It is also known that, in case of general graphs, this duality
becomes an approximate one, i.e., a vertex cover of size 2k. In both aforementioned
examples, the duality is between the notions of packing and covering of a collection

C of combinatorial objects of a graph. In Menger’s theorem C consists of all (S, T )-
paths of G while in K˝onig’s theorem C is the set of all edges of G. That way, both
aforementioned min-max theorems can be stated, for some class of graphs G (called
host class) and some gap function f : N → N, as follows:

For every graph G in G, either G contains k-vertex disjoint objects in C
or it contains f (k) vertices intersecting all objects in C that appear in G.

Clearly, for the case of Menger’s theorem the host class is the class of all graphs while
in the case of K˝onig’s theorem the host class is restricted to the class of bipartite
graphs. In both cases the derived duality is an exact one in the sense that f is the
identity function. However, this is not the case if we want to extend the duality of
K˝onig’s theorem in the case of all graphs, where we can consider f : k 7→ 2k (i.e., we
have an approximate duality).

One of the most celebrated results about packing/covering dualities was obtained
by Paul Erd˝os and Lajos P´osa in 1965 where the object to cover and pack was the
set of all cycles of G [EP65]. In this case the host class contains all graphs, while
f : k 7→ O(k · log k). Moreover, Erd˝os and P´osa proved that this gap is optimal in
the sense that it cannot be improved to a function f : k 7→ o(k · log k). This result
motivated a long line of research for min-max dualities that are not necessarily exact
or approximate. Since then, a multitude of results on Erd˝os–P´osa properties have
appeared for several combinatorial objects, including extensions to digraphs [LY78,
Sey96, RRST96b, HM13, GT10], rooted graphs [KK15, PW12, Joo14, BJS14], labeled
graphs [KW05], signed graphs [HNP06, ADG04], hypergraphs [Alo02, Bou13, BT15],
matroids [GK09], and other combinatorial structures [GL69] (see [Ree97] for a survey
on this topic). Also it is worth to stress that Erd˝os–P´osa dualities have been useful
in more applied domains. For example, in bioinformatics where they where useful
for upper-bounding the number of ﬁxed-points of a boolean networks [Ara08,ADG04,
ARS16].

The purpose of this paper is twofold. We ﬁrst describe some recent techniques
for proving Erd˝os–P´osa properties, mainly based on techniques related to tree-like
decompositions of graphs (Sections 3 and 4). We focused our presentation to the
description of general frameworks that, we believe, might be useful for further investi-
gations. Lastly, in Section 6, we provide an extensive update of results on Erd˝os–P´osa
properties, reﬂecting the current progress on this vibrant area of graph theory.

2 Deﬁnitions

Unless otherwise mentioned, graphs in this paper are ﬁnite, undirected, do not have
loops and they may have multiple edges. We call a graph nontrivial if contains at
least one edge. We denote by V (G) and E(G) the vertex and edge sets of a graph,
respectively, and we set |G| = |V (G)| and kGk = |E(G)|.

For x ∈ {v, e}, and G a graph, let Ax = V (G) if x = v and Ax = E(G) if x = e.
In this sense we use symbols v and e in order to distinguish the vertex and the edge

variants we of the properties/parameters that we are dealing with. A graph is subcubic
its maximum degree is bounded by 3.

Partial orders on graphs Given two graphs H and G, we say that H is an induced
subgraph of G if H can be obtained from G after removing edges. Additionally, H is
a subgraph of G if it can be obtained by some induced subgraph of G after removing
edges. We also say that H is a minor (resp.
topological minor) of G if it can be
obtained by some subgraph of G after contracting1 edges (after contracting edges
with some endpoint of degree at most 2). Finally, we say that a graph H is an
immersion of a graph G if it can be obtained from some subgraph of G after lifting2
pairs of edges that share some common endpoint.

Given a graph H, we denote by M(H), T (H), I(H) the class of all graphs that

contain H as a minor, topological minor, or immersion respectively.

Packings and coverings. Let H be a family of graphs and let x ∈ {v, e}. An x-H-
cover of G is a set C ∈ Ax(G) such that G\C does not contain any subgraph isomorphic
to a member of H. An x-H-packing in G is a collection of x-disjoint subgraphs of G,
each being isomorphic to some graph of H.

We denote by x-packH(G) the maximum size of an x-H-packing and by x-coverH(G)
the minimum size of an x-H-covering in G. Clearly, by deﬁnition, it always hold that
x-packH(G) ≤ x-coverH(G), for every graph G.

The Erd˝os–P´osa property. Let G and H be two graph classes, and let x ∈ {v, e}.
We refer to G as the host graph class and by H as the guest graph class. We say that
H has the x-Erd˝os–P´osa property for G if there is a function f : N → N such that the
following holds:

∀G ∈ G, x-coverH(G) ≤ f (x-coverH(G)).

Any function satisfying the above inequality is called a gap of the x-Erd˝os–P´osa prop-
erty of H for G. When a class of graphs has the x-Erd˝os–P´osa-property for the class
of ﬁnite graphs, we simply say that it has the x-Erd˝os–P´osa-property.

Rooted trees. A rooted tree is a pair (T, s) where T is a tree and s ∈ V (T ) is a
vertex referred to as the root. Given a vertex x ∈ V (T ), the descendants of x in (T, s),
denoted by desc(T,s)(x), is the set containing each vertex w such that the unique path
from w to s in T contains x. If y is a descendant of x and is adjacent to x, then it is
a child of x.

1The operation of contracting an edge {x, y} in a graph G introduces a new vertex vxy and makes

it adjacent with all neighbors of x and y and then deletes x and y.

2The operation of lifting a pair of edges {x, y}, {y, z} in a graph G increases by one the multi-
plicity of the edge {x, z} (or introduces this edge if it does not exists) and then reduces by one the
multiplicities of {x, y} and {y, x}.

Tree partitions. A tree partition of a graph G is a pair D = (X , T ) where T is a
tree and X = {Xt}t∈V (T ) is a partition of V (G) such that either n(T ) = 1 or for every
{x, y} ∈ E(G), there exists an edge {t, t′} ∈ E(T ) where {x, y} ⊆ Xt ∪ Xt′. Given an
edge f = {t, t′} ∈ E(T ), we deﬁne Ef as the set of edges with one endpoint in Xt and
the other in Xt′. The width of D is deﬁned as max{max{|Xt|}t∈V (T ), max{|Ef |}f ∈E(T )}.
The tree partition width of G is the minimum width over all tree partitions of G
and will be denoted by tpw(G). Tree partitions have been introduced in [See85] (see
also [Hal91]) and tree partition width has been deﬁned for simple graphs in [DO96].
The extension of this deﬁnition for multigraphs is due to [CRST15].

A rooted tree partition of a graph G is a triple D = (X , T, s) where (T, s) is a

rooted tree and (X , T ) is a tree partition of G.

Tree decompositions. A tree decomposition of a graph G is a pair (T, X ) where
T is a tree and X a family {Xt}t∈V (T ) of subsets of V (G) (called bags) indexed by
elements of V (T ) and such that the following holds

(i) St∈V (T ) Xt = V (G);

(ii) for every edge e of G there is an element of X containing both ends of e;

(iii) for every v ∈ V (G), the subgraph of T induced by {t ∈ V (T ), v ∈ Xt} is

connected.

The width of a tree decomposition T is deﬁned as equal to maxt∈V (T ) |Xt| − 1. The
treewidth of G, written tw(G), is the minimum width of any of its tree decompositions.

3 Erd˝os–P´osa from graph decompositions

Let H be a graph class, p be a graph parameter, and x ∈ {v, e}. We say that a function
f is a ceiling for the triple (p, H, x) if for every graph G, p(G) ≤ f (x-packH(G)).
Intuitively, there is a ceiling for the triple (p, H, x) if a large value of p on a graph
forces a large x-packing of elements of H.

Given a graph parameter p and an integer k, we denote

Gp≤k = {G, p(G) ≤ k}.

Theorem 1. Let H be a class of graphs, x ∈ {v, e}, p be a graph parameter, let
f : N → N be a function and let hr : N → N be a function, for every r ∈ N. Suppose
that the following two conditions hold:

A. f is a ceiling for the triple (p, H, x);

B. for every r ∈ N, H has the x-Erd˝os–P´osa-property for Gp≤r with gap hr;

then H has the x-Erd˝os–P´osa-property with gap k 7→ hf (k)(k).

4

Proof. Let G be a graph and let k = x-packH(G). We have p(G) ≤ f (k), by deﬁnition
of a ceiling. Therefore, G ∈ Gp≤r, and thus x-coverH(G) ≤ hf (k)(k).

Theorem 1 will be used as a master theorem for the results of this section.

3.1 Vertex version and tree decompositions

The next lemma follows by the combination of [CC13a] and [CC13b].

Lemma 1. For every planar graph H on h edges, there exists a ceiling f for the triple
(tw, M(H), v) where, f (k) = hO(1) · k · (log k)O(1).

A function f : R → R is said to be superadditive if f (x) + f (y) ≤ f (x + y) for every
pair x, y of positive reals. The following argument has been ﬁrst used in [FST11] (see
also [CC13a, RST13, CRST15]).

Lemma 2. Let H be a family of connected graphs. If f is a ceiling for (tw, H, v) then
H has the v-Erd˝os–P´osa property with gap k 7→ 5 · f (k) log(k + 1).

Proof. Let us show the following for every integer k: for every graph G, if v-packH(G) =
k then v-coverH ≤ 5f (k) log(k + 1). The proof is by induction on k. The base case
k = 0 is trivial. Let k > 0, and let us assume that the above statement holds for
every positive integer k′ < k (induction hypothesis).

Let G be a graph such that v-packH(G) = k. We will rely on the following claim.

Claim 1. There is a separation (A, B) of order tw(G) + 1 of G such that

k/3 ≤ v-packH(G[A \ B]) ≤ 2k/3.

Proof. We consider a special type of tree decomposition called nice tree decomposition.
A triple (T, r, {Xt}t∈V (T )) is said to be a nice tree decomposition of a graph G if
(T, {Xt}t∈V (T )) is a tree-decomposition where the following holds:

1. every vertex of T has degree at most 3;

2. (T, r) is a rooted and the bag of the root r is empty (Xr = ∅);

3. every vertex t of T is

• either a base node, i.e. a leaf of T whose bag is empty (Xt = ∅) and diﬀerent

from the root;

• or an introduce node, i.e. a vertex with only one child t′ such that Xt′ =

Xt ∪ {u} for some u ∈ V (G);

• or a forget node, i.e. a vertex with only one child t′ such that Xt = Xt′ ∪{u}

for some u ∈ V (G);

• or a join node, i.e. a vertex with two child t1 and t2 such that Xt = Xt1 =

Xt2.

5

It is known that every graph G has an nice tree decomposition with width tw(G) [Klo94].
We therefore can assume that (T, r, (Xt)t∈V (T )) is a nice tree decomposition of G of
optimal width. We deﬁne

Gt = G

 [s∈desc(T ,r)(t)

Xs


and G−

t = Gt \ Xt.

Let t be a vertex of T at minimal distance from a leaf subject to the requirement
v-packH(Gt) > 2k/3. Such a vertex exists, as v-packH(Gr) = k. Observe that t is either
a forget node, or a join node. Indeed, for every base node u we have v-packH(Gu) = 0.
Moreover, every introduce node u with child v satisﬁes v-packH(Gu) = v-packH(Gv),
since G−

u = G−
v .

First case: t is a forget node with child u. We set A = V (Gu) and B = V (G) \ V (G−

u ).
t is a join node with children u1, u2. We set A = V (Gui) and B =
Second case:
V (G) \ V (G−
ui), where ui is a child of t such that v-packH(Gui) ≥ k/3. Such child
exist because v-packH(Gt) = v-packH(Gu1) + v-packH(Gu2) (as t is a join node) and
v-packH(Gt) > 2k/3, by deﬁnition of t.

It is clear that in both cases (A, B) is a separation of order tw(G) + 1. The
inequality v-packH(G[A]) ≤ 2k/3 follows from the deﬁnition of t. In the ﬁrst case, we
have

v-packH(G[A]) =

v-packH(Gt) − 1

.

In the second case, the choice of i ensures that k/3 ≤ v-packH(G[A]).

Observe that tw(G) ≤ f (k), by deﬁnition of f. According to Claim 1, there is a
separation (A, B) of order tw(G) + 1 in G such that k/3 ≤ v-packH(G[A \ B]) ≤ 2k/3.
Let kA = v-packH(G[A \ B]) and kB = v-packH(G[B \ A]). It follows that kA, kB ≤
⌊2k/3⌋ .

We then have

v-coverH(G) ≤ v-coverH(G[A \ B]) + v-coverH(G[B \ A]) + |A ∩ B|
≤ v-coverH(G[A \ B]) + v-coverH(G[B \ A]) + f (k) + 1
≤ 5f (kA) log(kA + 1) + 5f (kB) log(kB + 1) + f (k) + 1.

Notice that in the case where k = 1, we get kA = kB = 0 and we have v-coverH(G) ≤
f (k) ≤ 3 f (k) log(k + 1). Therefore we now assume k ≥ 2. We can deduce from

(cid:3)

Corollary 1 (see also [CC13a] and [CC13b]). For every connected planar graph H
with h edges, the class M(H) has the Erd˝os–P´osa property with gap k 7→ hO(1) ·
k polylog(k).

Notice that the above proof strongly relies on the fact that H is connected. The
non-connected case requires some more ideas that are originating from [RS86] (also
used for forests in [FJW13]). We expose them hereafter. We will need the two next
lemmas.

Lemma 3 ( [RS86]). Let q, k be two positive integers, let T be a tree and let A1, . . . , Aq
be families of subtrees of T. Assume that for every i ∈ {1, . . . , q}, there are kq elements
of Ai that are pairwise vertex-disjoint. Then for every i ∈ {1, . . . , q}, there are k
elements T i

k of Ai such that

1, . . . , T i

A1

1, . . . A1

k, A2

1, . . . A2

k, . . . , Aq

1, . . . Aq

k

are all pairwise vertex-disjoint.

The next lemma is the Erd˝os–P´osa property of subtrees of a tree.

It can be

obtained from the fact that subtrees of a tree have the Helly property.

Lemma 4 (see [GL69]). Let T be a tree and let A be a collection of subtrees of T. For
every positive integer k, either T has (at least) k vertex disjoint subtrees that belong
to A, or T has a subset X of less than k vertices such that no subtree of T \ X belongs
to A.

We are now ready to deal with disconnected patterns.

Lemma 5 ( [RS86]). Let w be a positive integer and let H be a graph on q connected
components. M(H) has the v-Erd˝os–P´osa-property on the class of graphs of treewidth
at most w with gap k 7→ (w − 1)(kq − 1).

Proof. Let k be a positive integer. We want to show that either v-packM(H)(G) ≥ k
or v-coverM(H)(G) ≤ (w − 1)(kq − 1). Let H1, . . . , Hq be the connected components
of H. Let (T, X ) be a tree-decomposition of G of width w. For every subgraph F of G,
we denote by T (F ) the subgraph of T induced by the bags containing vertices of F.
Notice that T (F ) is connected if F is connected.

7

For every i ∈ {1, . . . , q}, we let Hi be the class of subgraphs of G that are isomor-

phic to a graph in M(Hi) and we consider the class Ti = {T (F ), F ∈ Hi}.

If for every i ∈ {1, . . . , q}, Ti contains kq vertex-disjoint trees, then according
to Lemma 3 there are pairwise vertex-disjoint trees {T i
j }i∈{1,...,q}, j∈{1,...,k}. Observe
that for every two subgraphs F, F ′ of G, if T (F ) and T (F ′) are vertex-disjoint, then so
are F and F ′. Therefore G has pairwise vertex-disjoint subgraphs {F i
j }i∈{1,...,q}, j∈{1,...,k}
such that F i
is isomorphic to an element of Hi for every i ∈ {1, . . . , q} and j ∈
j
{1, . . . , k} . This proves that in this case, v-packM(H)(G) ≥ k.

We therefore now assume that the above condition does not hold, namely there
is an index i ∈ {1, . . . , q} such that Ti contains less than kq vertex-disjoint trees.
Lemma 5 implies the existence of a subset X with |X| ≤ kq − 1 such that T \ X is
free from subtrees isomorphic to a member of Ti. Let Y denote the union of the bags
indexed by vertices in X. Observe that |Y | ≤ (w − 1)|X| ≤ (w − 1)(kq − 1). The
choice of Y ensures that G \ Y has no subgraph isomorphic to a member of Hi. Hence
v-coverM(Hi) ≤ (w − 1)(kq − 1). We deduce v-coverM(H) ≤ (w − 1)(kq − 1).

Corollary 2. For every planar graph H with h edges and q connected components,
the class M(H) has the Erd˝os–P´osa property with gap k 7→ q · hO(1) · k2 · polylog(k).

3.2 Edge version and tree partitions

In the edge variant of the Erd˝os–P´osa properties we use tree partition width as a
possible edge-analogue of treewidth. The following uses [DO96, Theorem 1.2].

Lemma 6. For every t ∈ N, there exists a ceiling for the triple (tpw, M(θt), e).

Proof. According to [DO96, Theorem 1.2], there is a function f : N → N such that for
every p ∈ N, every simple graph G satisfying tpw(G) ≥ f (p) contains as a subgraph
either a p-wall, or a p-path, or a p-star, or a p-fan. We omit the deﬁnition of these
graphs here, but we note that each of them contains a e-M(θt)-packing of size k as
soon as kt < p/2.

Let G be a graph such that tpw(G) ≥ f (2kt) · kt. If G has a multiedge e of
multiplicity ≥ kt, then it clearly contains an e-M(θt)-packing of size k. Therefore we
now assume that all edges of G have multiplicity < kt Observe that, if we denote by G
the underlying simple graph of G, we have tpw(G) ≥ tpw(G)
. Hence tpw(G) ≥ f (2kt)
and, by deﬁnition of f and the remark above, G contains a e-M(θt)-packing of size k.
As G is a subgraph of G, the aforementioned packing also belong to G, which proves
the lemma.

kt

The next result appeared in [GKRT16] and is strongly based on the results of [Wol15].

Theorem 2. For every planar subcubic graph H with h edges, there exists a ceiling
for the triple (tcw, I(H), e).

8

Let H be a class of graphs. We deﬁne ˜H as the set of all the subgraph minimal

elements of H, i.e.,

˜H = {H, H ∈ H and none of the subgraphs of H belongs to H}.

We deﬁne ∆(H) as the maximum number of edges incident to a vertex in a graph

of H (counting multiple edges). We also set ˜∆(H) = ∆( ˜H).

Lemma 7. For every graph H of h edges, it holds that ˜∆(M(H)) ≤ h, ˜∆(T (H)) ≤
h, ˜∆(I(H)) ≤ 2h.

Lemma 8. Let H be a class of connected non-trivial graphs where ˜∆(H) ≤ d. Then
for every r ∈ N, H has the e-Erd˝os–P´osa-property on Gtpw≤r with gap gr(k) = k · r ·
((r − 1)/2 + f (r)).

Proof. Let r ∈ N. We will show the following for every k ∈ N:
G ∈ Gtpw≤r, if e-packH(G) = k then e-coverH(G) ≤ gr(k).

for every graph

We proceed by induction. The base case k = 0 is trivial. We thus assume that
k > 0 and that the above statement holds for every positive integer k′ < k (induction
hypothesis).

Let G ∈ Gtpw≤r be a graph such that e-packH(G) = k. We assume that G is

connected, as otherwise we can treat each connected component separately.

Let (T, s, {Xt}t∈V (T )) be an optimal rooted distance decomposition of G. We deﬁne

Gt = GhSu∈desc(T ,s)(t) Xui . For every edge {u, v} of T we denote by E{u,v} the edges

of G with the one endpoint in Xu and the other one in Xv. Let t be a vertex of T of
minimum distance from a leaf, subject to e-packH(Gt) > 0.

Let M be a subgraph of Gt isomorphic to some member of H and let t1, . . . , tp be
the children of t such that V (Gti) ∩ V (M) 6= ∅ for every i ∈ {1, . . . , p} . Because of
the f -splittability of H, we have p ≤ f (r). In fact, by removing the vertices Xt to M,
we cannot obtain more than f (|Xt|) connected components.

Let C = E(Xt) ∪ Sp

i=1 E{t,ui} and let us consider then graph G′ = G \ C. Let
M ′ is a subgraph of G′ that is isomorphic to some member of H. By minimality of
t, e-packH(Gti) = 0, for every i ∈ {1, . . . , p} . Therefore, if M ′ contained an edge
e ∈ E(Gti) (for some i ∈ {1, . . . , p}), it would also contain an edge of E(G) \ E(Gti).
Since every graph of H is connected, M ′ would also need to contain some edge of Et,ui
in order to be connected to edges of E(G) \ E(Gti). However E(G′) ∩ Et,ui = ∅. We
deduce that for every subgraph M ′ of G′ that is isomorphic to some member of H,
we have E(M ′) ∩ E(M) = ∅. It follows that every e-H-packing in G′ is edge-disjoint
with M.

Hence e-packH(G′) < k, as otherwise a packing of size k in G′ would, together
with M, yield a packing of size k + 1 in G whereas e-packH(G) = k. By applying the
induction hypothesis on G′, there is a subset D ⊆ E(G′) such that e-packH(G′\D) = 0
and moreover |D| ≤ gr(k − 1). It is easy to see that C ∪ D is an e-H-cover of G.
Furthermore |C ∪ D| ≤ r(r − 1)/2 + r · f (r) + gr(k − 1) = gr(k), as required.

An application of Lemma 8 is the following result, which also relies on Theorem 1

and Lemma 6.

Corollary 3 ([CRST15]). For every r ∈ N≥1, M(θr) has the e-Erd˝os–P´osa property
with gap Or(k log k).

The next Lemma is the counterpart of Lemma 8, especially for the case of immer-

sion models for graphs of bounded tree-cut width.

Lemma 9 ([GKRT16]). Let t be a positive integer and let H be a connected non-
trivial planar subcubic graph of h edges. Then I(H) has the e-Erd˝os–P´osa-property
on Gtcw≤t with gap k 7→ t2hk.

Using Theorem 1, Lemma 9, and Theorem 2 we can also derive the following.

Corollary 4 ([GKRT16]). Let H be a connected non-trivial planar subcubic graph of
h edges. Then I(H) has the e-Erd˝os–P´osa-property with gap k 7→ (hk)O(1).

4 Erd˝os–P´osa from girth

In this section, we give an other proof of the Erd˝os–P´osa theorem that highlights a
technique for proving more general Erd˝os–P´osa-type results. The technique can be
informally summarized as follow. We prove that either G contains a small cycle or
that it can be reduced to a smaller graph with the same packing and covering number.
We then apply induction on either the graph where a small cycle has been deleted (in
the ﬁrst case), or on the reduced graph (in the second case). This technique has been
successfully applied in [FJW13, CRST15], for instance.

The girth of a graph the the minimum length of a cycle in this graph. Let us ﬁrst

recall the following result.

Lemma 10 ([Tho83], see also [Die05, Theorem 7.4.2]). There is a constant c ∈ R,
such that every graph of minimum degree at least 3 and girth at least c log q contains
Kq as a minor, for every q ∈ N≥1.

A direct consequence of this result is the following trichotomy.

Corollary 5. For every graph G and every integer q > 1, one of the following holds:

(i) G has a cycle on at most c log q vertices;

(ii) G has a vertex of degree at most 2;

(iii) G contains Kq as a minor.

We now prove the lemma that implies the classic Erd˝os–P´osa Theorem both for
the vertex and its edge version. Recall that Ax(G) denotes V (G) or E(G), depending
if x = v or x = e.

10

Lemma 11. For every q ∈ N+ and every x ∈ {v, e}, the set M(θ2) has the x-Erd˝os–
P´osa-property for the class of graphs excluding Kq as a minor with gap O(k · log q).

Proof. We will prove that for every non-negative integer k and every Kq-minor-free
graph G, either G has k x-disjoint cycles, or G has a subset X ⊆ Ax(G) of size at most
ck log q such that G\X is a forest. We proceed by induction on the pair (k, G), with the
well-founded order deﬁned by (k′, G′) ≤ (k, G) ⇐⇒ (k′ ≤ k and |Ax(G′)| ≤ |Ax(G)|),
for all graphs G, G′ and non-negative integers k, k′.

The base cases corresponding to k = 0 or |Ax(G)| = 0 are trivial. Let us now
assume that k ≥ 1, |Ax(G)| ≥ 1, and that the lemma holds for every pair (k′, G′) such
that (k′, G′) ≤ (k, G).

According to Corollary 5, either Gi has a cycle C on at most c log q vertices, or it
has a vertex v of degree at most two, or it contains Kq as a minor. The last case is
not possible, as we require G to be Kq-minor-free.

Whenever the ﬁrst case applies, we set G′ = G \ Ax(C) and we consider the
pair (k − 1, G′). If G′ contains k − 1 x-disjoint cycles, then G contains k x-disjoint
cycles obtained by adding C to those of G′ and we are done. Otherwise, the induction
hypothesis implies the existence of a subset X ′ ⊆ Ax(G′) with |X| ≤ c(k − 1) log q
such that G′ \ X ′ is a forest. Then by deﬁnition of C, X = X ′ ∪ Ax(C) has size at
most c log q and G \ X is a forest, as required.

In the second case, we delete v if it is isolated and we contract an edge e incident
with it otherwise. Notice that since we cannot apply the ﬁrst case, this contraction
does not decrease the number of cycles in G. Also, we can assume without loss of
generality that v (respectively e) is not part of a minimum x-cover of cycles in G,
as any vertex adjacent to v (respectively edge incident with e) covers all the cycles
covered by v (respectively e). Therefore the obtained graph G′ satisﬁes x-packH(G′)
and x-coverH(G) = x-coverH(G′). It is not hard to see that Ax(G′) < Ax(G). Therefore
we can apply the induction hypothesis on G′ and obtain the desired result on G′, that
immediately translates to G by the above remarks.

By setting q = 3k and observing that every graph containing K3k as a minor
also contains k vertex-disjoint cycles (hence also edge-disjoint), Lemma 11 yields the
vertex and edge versions of the classic Erd˝os–P´osa theorem as a corollary.

The technique presented in this section has been used to show the following results.

Theorem 3 ([FJW13]). For every forest H, M(H) has the v-Erd˝os–P´osa-property
with gap O(k).

Theorem 4 ([CRST15], see also [FJS13] for the vertex case). For every positive inte-
ger r and every x ∈ {v, e}, M(θr) has the x-Erd˝os–P´osa-property with gap O(k log k).

Actually, the ideas in [CRST15] permit us to replace M(θ2) by M(θr), r ≥ 2 in

Lemma 11.

To extend the idea of Lemma 11 in order to prove that some graph class H has the
x-Erd˝os–P´osa-property with gap f : N → N, one should show that for every positive
integer k and every graph G with x-packH(G) ≤ k,

11

• either there is a graph G′ with x-packH(G′) and x-coverH(G) = x-coverH(G′) and

such that |G′| + kG′k < |G| + kGk (reduction case);

• or G has a subgraph isomorphic to a member of H on at most f (k)/k ver-

tices/edges (progress case).

In both proofs of Theorem 3 and Theorem 4, the reduction case is done using the
graph theoretic notion of a protrusion introduced in [BFL+09a,BFL+09b] (or variants
of it). Roughly speaking, the idea is to identify large parts of the graph that have
constant treewidth (or constant tree partition width, in case of Theorem 4) and a small
interface towards the rest of the graph and then prove that they can be replaced by
smaller ones without changing the packing or the covering number.

5 Results in terms of containment relations

For every partial order (cid:22) on graphs, and for every graph H, let

G(cid:22)(H) = {G | H (cid:22) G}.

For every x ∈ {v, e}, we deﬁne

EP x

(cid:22) = {H | G(cid:22)(H) has the x-Erd˝os–P´osa-property}

A general question on Erd˝os–P´osa properties is to characterize EP x
(cid:22) for several con-
tainment relations. In this section we mainly provide some negative results about this
problem. We start with the following easy observation.

Lemma 12. If (cid:22) is the subgraph or the induced subgraph relation, x ∈ {v, e}, and H
is a non-trivial graph, then G(cid:22)(H) has the x-Erd˝os–P´osa-property, with gap f : k 7→
k · |Ax(G)|. In other words, EP x

(cid:22) is the set of all graphs.

Proof. Let H and G be two graphs and let k = x-packG(cid:22)(H)(G). Let M1, . . . , Mk be a
v-G(cid:22)(H)-packing (respectively e-G(cid:22)(H)-packing) of size k with the minimal number
of vertices (respectively edges). Observe that in this case, |Mi| = |H| (respectively
i=1 V (Mi) (respectively X =
i=1 E(Mi)). As the packing we consider is of size k, the graph G \ X does not
have any subgraph isomorphic to a member of G(cid:22)(H). Hence X is an v-G(cid:22)(H)-cover
(respectively e-G(cid:22)(H)-cover), and besides we have |X| = k · |H| (respectively |X| =
k · kHk).

kMik = kHk) for every i ∈ {1, . . . , k} . Let X = Sk
Sk

Notice that in case x = v, it is not necessary to demand that H is non-trivial in

the statement of Lemma 12.

5.1 Some negative results

Let us now state several negative results on the Erd˝os–P´osa-property of classes related
to topological minors.

In the proofs below, we use the notion of Euler genus of a graph G. The Euler
genus of a non-orientable surface Σ is equal to the non-orientable genus ˜g(Σ) (or the
crosscap number). The Euler genus of an orientable surface Σ is 2g(Σ), where g(Σ)
is the orientable genus of Σ. We refer to the book of Mohar and Thomassen [MT01]
for more details on graph embeddings. The Euler genus of a graph G is the minimum
integer γ such that G can be embedded on a surface of the Euler genus γ.

Lemma 13. Let H be a non-planar graph. Then T (H) does not have the v-Erd˝os–
P´osa-property.

Proof. For every integers k > 0 and d, we denote by Γd,k the graph obtained from a
grid of width dk and height d + k − 1 by adding k vertices a1, . . . , ak (that we call
apices) and connecting a1 to the d ﬁrst vertices on the ﬁrst row of the grid (starting
from the left), a2 to the d next vertices, and so on. For every i ∈ {0, . . . , d − 1}, the
set of vertices at indices {ik + j, j ∈ {0, . . . , k − 1}} on the last row of Γd,k is called
the i-th port of Γd,k. We will refer to the vertex at index ik + j of the last row as the
j-th vertex of the i-th port. See Figure 1 for a drawing of Γ4,3. On this drawing, the
ports are U0, . . . , U3.

Figure 1: The gadget Γ4,3 used in Lemma 13.

Let k be a positive integer. For every vertex v of H, we arbitrarily choose an
ordering of its neighbors and we denote by σv(u) the rank of u in this ordering (ranging
from 0 to deg(v) − 1), for every neighbor u of v. We also let Fv be a copy of the
graph Γdeg(v),k.

The graph Gk can be constructed from the disjoint union of the graphs of {Fv, v ∈
V (H)} by adding, for every pair u, v of adjacent vertices, the edge connecting the i-th

13

vertex of the σv(u)-th port of Fv to the i-th vertex of the σu(v)-th port of Fu, for
every i ∈ {0, . . . , k − 1} . Informally, we connect the vertices of the σv(u)-th port of
Fv to the vertices of the σu(v)-th port of Fu using “parallel” edges.

It can be easily checked that the Euler genera of Gk and H are equal. As the
Euler genus of the disjoint union of two copies of H is larger than the one of H
(see [BHK62]), we get that v-packT (H)(G) < 2. On the other hand, our construction
ensures that v-packT (H)(G) ≥ 1.

Let us now show that for every subset X ⊆ V (Gk) with |X| < k we have
v-packT (H)(G \ X) ≥ 1. This would complete the proof, since {Gk, k ∈ N≥1} would
be an inﬁnite family of graphs that have no v-T (H)-packings of size 2 but where a
minimum v-T (H)-cover can be arbitrarily large.

Let u and v be two adjacent vertices of H, and let d = deg(v). For For every

i ∈ {0, . . . , k − 1}, let Ci denote the vertices that are

• either in the same column of Fu as the i-th vertex of the σu(v)-th port of Fu;

• or in the same column of Fv as the i-th vertex of the σv(u)-th port of Fv.

The family {Ci, i ∈ {1, . . . , k}} contains k vertex disjoint elements, therefore at least
one of the does not contain any vertex from X (as |X| < k). Therefore, for every edge
{u, v} of H there is an edge f ({u, v}) between a vertex x of the σu(v)-th port of Fu
and a vertex y of the σv(u)-th port of Fv such that no vertex of the same column as x
in Fu (respectively y in Fv) belong to X. Using the same argument we can show that
for every vertex v ∈ V (H) there is an apex a such that the columns of Fv adjacent to
a are free of vertices of X. Also we know that at least d rows do not contain vertices
from X, as the grid of Fv has height d + k − 1. Therefore Fv contains as a subgraph
a grid Sv such that:

1. an apex a is adjacent to d vertices of the ﬁrst row of Sv;

2. for every vertex u adjacent to v, the edge f ({u, v}) shares one vertex the last

row of Sv;

3. no vertex of the last row of Sv belong to two edges f ({u, v}) and f ({u′, v}) for

some distinct neighbors u, u′ of v;

4. Sv has height and width at least d;

5. Sv does not contain any vertex of X.

We deduce that Fv \ X contains d paths P v

0 , . . . , Pd−1 that have only the apex a
as common vertex and such that Pi connects a to an endpoint of f ({v, ui}), where ui
is the neighbor of v of rank i, for every i ∈ {0, . . . , d − 1} . It is now easy to see that
the graph

contains a subdivision of H that does not contain any vertex of X. This concludes the
proof.

The proof of Lemma 13 can be adapted to the setting of the edge-Erd˝os–P´osa-

property under the additional requirement that the pattern is subcubic.

Lemma 14. Let H be a subcubic non-planar graph. Then T (H) does not have the
e-Erd˝os–P´osa-property.

Proof. Let k be a positive integer. We use the same construction of Gk as in the
proof of Lemma 13 with the following modiﬁcations: each vertex v of degree d ≥ 4 of
Gk is replaced by a subcubic tree, the leaves of which are the neighbors of v. Let us
call G′
k and Gk are
equal. Moreover, as G′
k is subcubic, every e-T (H)-packing is also an v-T (H)-packing.
We then obtain as previously that e-packT (H)(G′
k) = 1. The arguments to show that
e-coverT (H)(G′

k the graph we obtain. It is not hard to see that the genera of G′

k) ≥ k are identical to the ones used in the proof of Lemma 13.

In fact, Lemma 13 and Lemma 14 can be used to prove that more general classes
do not have the Erd˝os–P´osa-property, as follows. As we will see in Corollary 6
and Corollary 7, the conditions of Lemma 15 already encompass several well-studied
classes.

Lemma 15. Let x ∈ {v, e}, let H be a non-planar graph and let H be a class of graphs
such that:

(i) T (H) ⊆ H; and

(ii) H is graph of minimum Euler genus in H;

(iii) if x = e, then H is subcubic.

Then H does not have the x-Erd˝os–P´osa-property.

Proof. Let k be a positive integer. We again consider the constructions of Gk and G′
k
used in the proofs of Lemma 13 and Lemma 14. Let Jk be Gk if x = v and Jk = G′
k
if x = e. Let show that v-packH(Jk) = 1. For this, let us assume that there is an
x-T (H)-packing F1, . . . , Fp, for some p ∈ N≥2 in Jk. It is crucial to note that in both
the cases x = v and x = v, the subgraphs F1, . . . , Fp are vertex-disjoint. In fact, when
x = v, this follows from the deﬁnition of a v-T (H)-packing, and if x = e it is because
G′

k is subcubic. Then we have:

γ(Jk) ≥ γ(F1 ∪ · · · ∪ Fp)

=

p

Xi=1

γ(Fi)

≥ p · γ(H)

γ(Jk) > γ(H)

15

(see [BHK62])

(by minimality of H)
(contradiction).

We reached a contradiction, hence v-packH(Jk) = 1. On the other hand,

v-coverH(Jk) ≥ v-coverT (H)(Jk) ≥ k.

The last inequality can be found in the proof of Lemma 13 or Lemma 14 (depending
if x = v or x = e). This concludes the proof.

Corollary 6. For every non-planar graph H, none of I(H) and M(H) have the
v-Erd˝os–P´osa-property.

Corollary 7. For every subcubic non-planar graph H, none of I(H) and M(H) have
the e-Erd˝os–P´osa-property.

Corollary 7 can be strengthened by dropping the degree condition on H when

considering minor models of H, as follows.

Lemma 16. For every non-planar graph H, M(H) does not have the e-Erd˝os–P´osa-
property.

Proof. Let k be a positive integer. Again we use the graph G′
k constructed as in
Lemma 14. We modify it by replacing every apex a by a subcubic tree, the leaves of
which are the neighbors of a. Let G′′
k denote the graph that we obtain. Observe that
G′′
k is subcubic. Therefore, using the same argument as in the proof of Lemma 14
we can show that e-packM(H)(G) = 1. In the sequel we use the terminology of the
proof of Lemma 13. Let F ′′
v denote the graph obtained from Fv by replacing every
vertex u of degree at least 4 by a subcubic tree, the leaves of which are the neighbors
of u, for every v ∈ V (H). The proof that e-coverM(H)(G) ≥ k goes as in the proof
of Lemma 13, except that we obtain, for every v ∈ V (H), that F ′′
v \ X contains a
tree, the leaves of which are endpoints of f ({v, ui}) for i ∈ {0, . . . , d − 1} (instead of
paths connecting an apex to endpoints of f ({v, ui})). Fortunately this is enough to
guarantee that G′′

k \ X contains H as a minor, and we are done.

Let us now summarize results related to the most common containment relations.

Subgraphs and induced subgraphs: EP x

(cid:22) is the class of all graphs, both for (cid:22) be-
ing the subgraph and induced subgraph relation, for every x ∈ {v, e} (Lemma 12).

Minors: EP v

≤m is the class of planar graphs [RS86]. Recently, an extension of this
characterization, for strongly connected directed graphs, appeared in [AKKW16].
About the edge version, the authors of [RST13] proved that EP e
≤m includes the
class {θr}r∈N≥1, and we show in Lemma 16 that EP e
≤m is a subclass of planar
graphs (see also [CRST15]).

Topological Minors: EP v

≤tm has been characterized in [LPW14]. There are trees
that do not belong to EP v
≤tm does not contain any
non-planar graph (Lemma 13) and EP e
≤tm does not contain any non-planar sub-
cubic graph (Lemma 14). Analogous characterizations for the case of strongly
connected digraphs have recently appeared in [AKKW16].

≤tm [Tho88]. The class EP v

Immersions: As proved in [GKRT16], EP v

≤imm contains all non-trivial, connected, planar subcubic graphs. More-
≤imm does not contain any non-planar graph (Corollary 6) and EP e
over, EP v
≤imm
does not contain any subcubic non-planar graph (Corollary 7). On the other
hand there is a 3-connected planar graph of maximum degree 4 that belongs to
none of EP v

≤imm and EP v

≤imm [GKRT16].

6 Summary of results

Most (but not all) of the notation used in this section is deﬁned in Section 6.3.

6.1 Positive results

We provide a series of tables presenting known results on the Erd˝os–P´osa property of
some graph classes, sorted depending on the pattern. Results related to other struc-
tures (matroids, hypergraphs, geometry) and to fractional versions are not mentioned
here.

A dash in the “gap” column means that the authors did not explicitly provided a

gap function (even though one may be computable from the proof).

The fourth column refers to the type of packing/cover, cf. Section 6.3.

Patterns with prescribed vertices
Let us ﬁrst present the two settings of Erd˝os–P´osa problems with prescribed vertices
that we want to deal with here. The ﬁrst type is when the guest class consists of
ﬁxed subgraphs of the host graph. For instance, one can consider a family F of
(non necessarily disjoint) subtrees of a tree T , and compare the maximum number
of disjoint elements in F with the minimum number of vertices/edges of T meeting
all elements of F . We will refer to these guest classes by words indicating that we
are dealing with substructures (like “subtrees”). We stress that in this setting, the
host class is allowed to contain one subgraph F of the host graph, but not one other

20

subgraph F ′ even if F and F ′ are isomorphic.

In order to introduce the second type of problem, we need the following deﬁnition.
Let x ∈ {v, e}. If H is a class of graphs, G is a graph and S ⊆ Ax(G), then a S-H-
subgraph of G is a subgraph of G isomorphic to some member of H and that contain
one edge/vertex of S. We are now interested in comparing, for every graph G and every
S ⊆ Ax(G), the maximum number of S-H-subgraph of G with the minimum number
of elements of Ax(G) that meet all S-H-subgraphs of G. We refer to these problems
by preﬁxing the guest class with an “S” (like in “S-cycles”). A generalization of this
type of problem has been introduced in [KM15]: instead of one set S, one considers
a collection Z = {Z1, Z2, Z3} of three subsets of Ax(G) and a Z-subgraph is required
to intersect at least two sets of Z.

For every positive integer t, a t-path is a disjoint union of t paths, and a t-subpath
of a t-path G is a subgraph that has a connected intersection with every connected
component of G. The concept of t-forests and t-subforests is deﬁned similarly.

6.3 Some questions and conjectures

Clearly, the most general question on Erd˝os–P´osa-properties is to characterize the
class EP x
(cid:22) (deﬁned in Section 5) for various instantiations of x and (cid:22) and optimize the
corresponding gap. In what follows we sample some related conjectures and questions
that have appeared in the bibliography.

23

Question 1 ([Tho88]). Is it true that for every class H of graphs, either H has the v-
Erd˝os–P´osa property or there is no integer q such for every graph G with v-packH(G) ≤
1 it holds that v-coverH(G) ≤ q. In particular, it is true when H consists of connected
graphs and is closed under topological minors?

Conjecture 1 (Tuza’s conjecture [Tuz90]). For every graph G it holds that

e-coverK3(G) ≤ 2 · e-packK3(G).

Conjecture 2 ([BBR07]). Let l ≥ 6 be an integer. Let G be a graph containing no
v-C≥l-packing of size 2. Then there exists a v-C≥l-cover of G of size at most l.

Conjecture 3 (Jones’ conjecture [KLL02]). Let C denotes the class of all cycles. For
every planar graph G, it holds that

v-coverC ≤ 2 · v-packC(G).

Conjecture 4 ( [BJS14]). S-cycles of C≥l has the v-Erd˝os–P´osa property with gap
O(k(l + log k)).

Appendix: Notation used in Section 6

In this appendix we recall or introduce (some of) the notations that are used in
Section 6.

Types of packings/covers. The fourth column gives the type of the packings/covers
the current line is about. The character v (respectively e) refers to vertex-disjoint (re-
spectively edge-disjoint) packings and vertex (respectively edge) covers. We write v/e
when the mentioned result holds for both the vertex and the edge version. e1/2 corre-
sponds to half-integral packings (i.e. each edge can be used at most twice) and edge
covers. Finally, w stands for vertex covers and packings where every vertex v of the
host graph can be used at most w(v) times by every packing, where w is a function
mapping reals to the vertices of the host graph.

Classes of graphs. We denote by I1/2(H) the class of all graphs containing H
as a half-integral3 immersion. For every t ∈ N, T(0 mod t)(H) denotes the class of
subdivisions of H where every edge is subdivided 0 mod t times. The class of cycles
of length at least t is referred to as C≥t, or ~C≥t when dealing with directed cycles. A
dumb-bell is a graph obtained by connecting two cycles by a (non-trivial) path. We
denote by L a graph class deﬁned in the manuscript [LPW14]. For every positive
integer k with, we say that a graph is k-near bipartite if every set X of vertices
contains a stable of size at least |X|/2 − k. A graph is ﬂat if every edge belongs to at
most two triangles.

Deﬁnitions from [GT10]. A digraph is strongly planar if it has a planar drawing
such that for every vertex v, the edges with head v form an interval in the cyclic
ordering of edges incident with v (deﬁnition from [GT10]). An odd double circuit is a
digraph obtained from an undirected circuit of odd length more than 2 by replacing
each edge by a pair of directed edges, one in each direction. F7 is the digraph obtained
from the directed cycle on vertices v1, . . . , v7, v1, by adding the edges creating the
directed cycle v1, v3, v5, v7, v2, v4, v6, v1. We denote by F the class of digraphs with
no butterﬂy minor isomorphic to an odd double circuit, or F7 (for the deﬁnition of
butterﬂy minors of digraphs see [GT10, JRST01, AKKW16]).

Deﬁnitions from [DZ02, DXZ03]. An odd ring is a graph obtained from an odd
cycle by replacing every edge {u, v} by either a triangle, or three triangles uab and ucd
together with the edges {b, c} and {a, d}. We denote by G1 the class of graphs with
no induced subdivision of the following: K2,3, a wheel, or an odd ring. We denote by
G2 the class of graphs with no induced subdivision of the following: K3,3, a wheel, or
an odd ring.

3A graph H is a half-integral immersion of a graph G is H is an immersion of the graph obtained

by G after duplicating the multiplicity of all its edges.
